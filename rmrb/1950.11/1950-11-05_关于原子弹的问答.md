　　Questions and Answers About the Atomic Bomb
    Wen Jize
    The famous American warmonger Chennault also publicly stated that Japan's surrender had nothing to do with the atomic bomb. He once told a reporter from the "New York Times": "The Soviet Union's participation in the war against Japan was the decisive factor in accelerating the end of the war; even if the atomic bomb had not been dropped, the result would have been the same."
    Q: Why should the atomic bomb be banned?
    A: The atomic bomb is a very destructive bomb. The purpose of using atomic bombs in war is nothing more than to massively kill and destroy the residents and property in the enemy's cities. Anyone who attempts to use atomic bombs to fight is deliberately trying to attack other countries. Therefore, we firmly advocate banning it.
    Q: How destructive is the atomic bomb exactly?
    A: One atomic bomb, in terms of its destructive power to buildings, is roughly equivalent to 2,000 or 3,000 tons of ordinary bombs. Dropping an atomic bomb will cause severe damage to buildings within approximately five square kilometers (approximately equal to twenty square *shi li*; according to the old Chinese *li* measurement, that is less than four *li* square). However, the extent of the damage also depends on the type of building. Japanese wooden houses or single-story brick houses will be severely damaged, while reinforced concrete buildings will fare better. On August 6, 1945, the United States dropped an atomic bomb on Hiroshima, Japan, and three days later, another atomic bomb on Nagasaki. Many houses in these two cities were destroyed, but some sturdy buildings and some sturdy air-raid shelters near the explosion site did not suffer much damage.

    The atomic bomb's lethality to people depends on the air defense situation. It is said that in the Hiroshima bombing, more than 100,000 people were killed or injured; in the Nagasaki bombing, 70,000 to 80,000 people were killed or injured. The main reason for so many casualties in these two instances was the sudden atomic bomb attack, leaving people no time to escape. In Nagasaki, hundreds of people who were close to the explosion site and hiding in sturdy air-raid shelters were not injured; it can be seen that with air defense preparations, there would not be so many casualties.

    But in any case, the atomic bomb is ultimately a very cruel weapon, and its lethality is much greater than that of ordinary bombs.
    Q: How exactly is the atomic bomb made? Is it a very mysterious thing?
    A: The atomic bomb is not made of ordinary explosives. It is made of a metal called uranium, which is also produced in China. There is also a metal called thorium, which can also be used to make atomic bombs. Scientists use this metal to conduct experiments and discover a very powerful energy (called "atomic energy"). The atomic bomb is based on the principle of atomic energy. So the atomic bomb is not a mysterious thing. In the past, when Chinese people first saw the cameras brought by foreigners, they were very surprised. Superstitious people even claimed that they were made by cutting out children's eyes. Now everyone knows that cameras are manufactured based on the results of scientific research. Whoever understands this scientific principle and has this scientific and technical equipment can make a camera. Although the scientific principle of the atomic bomb is more complicated, the situation is the same. The United States deliberately makes the atomic bomb sound very mysterious, as if only it can manufacture it, so it can conquer the world. These are all lies.
    Q: Can having the atomic bomb guarantee victory in war?
    A: Relying on the atomic bomb cannot determine the outcome of a war. Not only the atomic bomb, but even more powerful weapons than the atomic bomb, can never determine the outcome of a war. Because first, the decisive factor in the outcome of a war is human power, not weapons. In the War of Resistance Against Japan, Japan's weapons were stronger than China's, but Japan could not conquer China and was instead defeated. In the People's Liberation War, Chiang Kai-shek, supported by the United States, had much stronger weapons than the People's Liberation Army, but the People's Liberation Army still achieved a complete victory. It can be seen that the outcome of a war is not determined solely by weapons.

    Second, as a weapon, the atomic bomb also has great weaknesses. The atomic bomb cannot be used for ordinary battlefields and military targets, and other than causing destruction and psychological threats, it cannot solve the main problems in combat, namely land warfare problems. In World War II, the Allied air force dropped approximately 2.5 million tons of bombs on Germany and its occupied countries. Assuming one atomic bomb is equivalent to 2,000 or 3,000 tons of ordinary bombs, that is equivalent to more than 800 or 1,200 atomic bombs. Under such bombing conditions, Germany's military industry was not destroyed. On the contrary, it continued to rise year by year, increasing by more than half from 1940 to 1944. The main force that destroyed Germany's military strength was the Soviet Union's artillery, tanks, and infantry. From such facts, it can also be explained that the atomic bomb cannot determine the outcome of a war.

    In World War II, the United States dropped two atomic bombs on Japan, and then Japan surrendered. Therefore, American imperialism boasted that its atomic bomb was the decisive reason for Japan's surrender. This statement is completely inconsistent with the facts. The reason why the United States made such nonsense was to erase the decisive role played by the Soviet Union's dispatch of troops to eliminate the Kwantung Army in Japan's surrender. At that time, Japan saw that its Kwantung Army had been eliminated by the Soviet Union, and the Chinese People's Liberation Army had launched a large-scale counter-offensive. Seeing that its power on the Chinese mainland could not be preserved, and that Germany had already failed, its situation in the world became even more isolated, so it quickly indicated its surrender in order to retain some strength to collude with American imperialism. Therefore, the reason for Japan's surrender was definitely not the atomic bomb. The famous American warmonger Chennault also publicly stated that Japan's surrender had nothing to do with the atomic bomb. He once told a reporter from the "New York Times": "The Soviet Union's participation in the war against Japan was the decisive factor in accelerating the end of the war; even if the atomic bomb had not been dropped, the result would have been the same."
    Q: Does the Soviet Union also have atomic bombs?
    A: The Soviet Union had atomic bombs in 1947. Soviet Foreign Minister Vyshinsky once said: "If unfortunately the atomic bomb is needed, we will have as many atomic bombs as necessary." At a meeting of the Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly, he also warned those warmongers who disagreed with the ban on atomic weapons: "All the calculations of the warmongers are unreliable. They forget that bombs can be retaliated with bombs." The Soviet Union has always adhered to a foreign policy of strengthening peace and international cooperation. Therefore, although the Soviet Union has atomic bombs, it firmly advocates banning the use of atomic weapons and advocates declaring the government that first uses atomic weapons as a war criminal. This is precisely the manifestation of the Soviet Union's adherence to a policy of peace.
    Q: What places are likely to become targets for atomic bombs?
    A: It costs a lot of money to make atomic bombs. One atomic bomb costs one to two billion US dollars, which is tens of trillions of RMB. The manufacturing of atomic bombs is extremely complex technically. It took the United States two or three years to manufacture the first two atomic bombs. Manufacturing atomic bombs is an extremely difficult task. Therefore, when using atomic bombs, they can only be used to deal with very large targets. Large cities with concentrated industries, large-scale fleets gathered together, etc., may become targets for bombing. Atomic bombs can cause greater damage to these targets. But other than that, there is no target that can allow the atomic bomb to fully exert its power.

    On the land battlefield, no matter how concentrated manpower and material resources are, there is no need to use atomic bombs at all. Because dropping an atomic bomb on a position may kill a small portion of the soldiers on the ground of that position, but it cannot harm soldiers who are farther away from the explosion site, and soldiers hiding in underground trenches or concrete bunkers. These soldiers can still resist enemy attacks. As for dealing with artillery positions, airplanes in airports, and tank formations, it is even more difficult to use atomic bombs.

    Will atomic bombs be used to bomb ordinary small and medium-sized cities, towns, railway stations, truck convoys on highways, bridges, and other targets? That is absolutely impossible, because that would be even more uneconomical. This is like we would not use a butcher's knife to sharpen a pencil.

    Therefore, in any case, the effectiveness of the atomic bomb is very limited.

    Our China, and our allied Soviet Union, have a large territory, a dispersed population, dispersed industries, and weapons and materials can also be dispersed. Atomic bombs will not have any effect on such countries. In June 1945, a report from the "Scientists Committee" of the United States called "Social and Political Consequences of the Use of Atomic Weapons" also said: "Russia and China (due to their vast territory and dispersed population) are currently the only major powers that can still exist under the attack of atomic weapons."
    Q: Can atomic bombs be defended against?
    A: There has never been an undefendable weapon. The history of warfare tells us: every time a new weapon is invented, defensive weapons are quickly invented. A passive way to defend against atomic bombs is to build solid air-raid shelters. The situation in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan, proves that even near the ground of the explosion, buildings several feet thick have considerable protection against the power of atomic bombs. Most of the casualties are due to the collapse of buildings or the spread of large fires. If there are solid air defense facilities, it can resist this kind of bombing. As mentioned earlier, when Nagasaki was bombed, hundreds of people hid in air-raid shelters and were not injured, which proves that air-raid shelters can protect people from harm unless directly hit. Highlands can also defend against atomic bombs. According to Professor Blackett's book "Military and Political Consequences of Atomic Energy," the reason why Nagasaki suffered less damage than Hiroshima was mainly because Nagasaki's ground was rugged and uneven, and the highlands shielded some parts of the city, preventing these parts from being affected by the power of the bomb. Based on this situation, if there is a large mountain in the way, the power of the atomic bomb will of course be more difficult to reach. The active methods of defending against atomic bombs are: first, using bombers to bomb the take-off locations of enemy planes carrying atomic bombs; second, deploying a tight air defense network with fighter planes and anti-aircraft guns to prevent enemy planes from flying in.
    Q: The United States has announced that it has a weapon more powerful than the atomic bomb, called the hydrogen atomic bomb. Is that true?
    A: This is bragging to scare people. The United States originally thought it could use the atomic bomb to scare the Soviet Union and the people of the world, but seeing that this magic weapon was not working, it proposed the "hydrogen atomic bomb" to scare people. US President Truman issued a statement on January 30 this year, calling on the Atomic Energy Commission to continue working on all atomic weapons, including the hydrogen atomic bomb. Truman deliberately said this to conduct so-called psychological warfare. Sure enough, many lying and deceiving newspaper reporters of American imperialism followed suit, boasting as if the United States had been able to manufacture a hydrogen atomic bomb. In fact, until today, no one has successfully manufactured a hydrogen atomic bomb. An American atomic physicist said that we cannot predict whether a hydrogen atomic bomb can be made, and even if it can be made, it will take at least three years to create a prototype of a hydrogen atomic bomb.

    It is the first time in history that a weapon has been announced before it has been created. Why did Truman do this? Of course, it was deliberately released to scare people. From this incident, it can also be seen that American imperialism is a paper tiger.
    Q: How should we deal with the atomic bomb threat?
    A: American imperialism is using the atomic bomb to scare people; some lurking counter-revolutionaries in our country are also spreading rumors, saying how powerful the atomic bomb is, and even creating ghost stories such as the "castration squad," making people uneasy. We must smash these rumors and conspiracies. We must recognize that the atomic bomb is not terrible, and it can never determine the outcome of a war. We should go everywhere to publicize and explain these principles; but because the atomic bomb is a very destructive and inhumane weapon, we should firmly advocate banning its use and declare the first person to use the atomic bomb as a war criminal.

　　关于原子弹的问答
    温济泽
    美国的著名的战争贩子陈纳德，也公开说过日本投降和原子弹没有关系。他曾经对《纽约时报》记者说：“苏联参加对日战争是使战争加快结束的决定性的因素；即使原子弹没有投掷，结果仍是一样。”
    问：为什么要禁止原子弹？
    答：原子弹是一种杀伤力很大的炸弹。在战争中使用原子弹，目的无非是为了大量地杀死和破坏对方的城市中的居民和财产。谁企图使用原子弹作战，谁就是存心要进攻别国。所以我们坚决主张禁止它。
    问：原子弹的杀伤力到底有多大？
    答：一颗原子弹，就它对于建筑物的破坏力来说，大约相等于两千吨或三千吨的普通炸弹。投下一颗原子弹，大约五平方公里（大约等于我国二十平方市里；照我国旧里的算法，也就是不到四里见方）以内的建筑物要受到严重的破坏。不过破坏的程度，也要看是那一种建筑物。像日本那种木房子，或单层的砖房子，将要被破坏得很厉害，钢骨水泥的建筑物就要好些。一九四五年八月六日，美国在日本广岛投了一颗原子弹，三天以后，又在长崎投了一颗原子弹，这两个城里的许多房屋都被破坏了，但是也有些坚固的建筑物，还有些靠近爆炸地点的坚固的防空壕，并没有遭受多大破坏。
    原子弹对于人的杀伤力如何，要看防空的情形怎样。据说，广岛被炸的那一次，死伤十几万人；长崎被炸的那一次，死伤七八万人。这两次死伤这么多人的主要原因，是原子弹突然袭击，人们来不及躲避。在长崎，在靠近爆炸地点，有几百个人躲在坚固的防空壕里，都没有受伤；可见得，如果有防空的准备，是不会死伤这么多人的。
    但无论如何，原子弹终究是一种很残忍的武器，其杀伤力是比普通炸弹大得多的。
    问：原子弹究竟怎样做出来的？是不是一种很神秘的东西？
    答：原子弹不是用普通炸药做成的。它是用叫做铀的一种金属做成的，这种金属在中国也有出产。还有一种金属叫做钍，也可以用来做原子弹。科学家用这种金属做实验，发现一种很强大的能力（叫做“原子能”），原子弹就是根据原子能的原理而造出来的。所以原子弹并不是什么神秘的东西。从前中国人初看到外国人带来的照相机时，非常诧异。迷信的人甚至附会说是割了小孩的眼睛来做成的。现在大家都知道，照相机是根据一种科学研究的结果而制造出来的。谁懂得这种科学的道理，谁有这种科学的技术设备，谁就能造出照相机来。原子弹的科学原理虽然复杂些，但也是同样的情形。美国故意把原子弹说得很神秘，好像只有它才能制造，因此它就能征服全世界，那都是骗人的话。
    问：究竟有了原子弹是不是就能打胜仗呢？
    答：靠原子弹是不能够决定战争的胜败的。不仅原子弹，即使有比原子弹更厉害的武器，也绝不能够决定战争的胜败。因为第一，对于战争胜败起决定作用的，首先是人的力量，而不是武器。在抗日战争中，日本的武器比中国强，但是日本并不能征服中国，反而被打败了，在人民解放战争中，得到美国支持的蒋介石有比人民解放军强得多的武器，但是人民解放军还是得到了彻底的胜利。可见战争的胜败不是光靠武器来决定的。
    第二，当作一种武器，原子弹也有很大的弱点。原子弹不能用于普通的战场和军事目标，而且除了造成破坏和心理威胁以外，并不能解决作战中的主要问题，即陆上作战问题。在第二次世界大战中，盟国空军投到德国和它占领国家的炸弹，约有二百五十多万吨，以一颗原子弹等于二千吨或三千吨普通炸弹计算，那就等于八百多颗或一千二百多原子弹。在这样轰炸的情况下，德国的军事工业并没有被摧毁，相反地，仍旧逐年上升，一九四四年比一九四○年增加了一倍半以上。最后摧毁了德国军事力量的，主要的是苏联的炮队、战车和步兵。从这样的事实，也可以说明原子弹并不能决定战争的胜败。
    在第二次世界大战中，美国曾在日本丢下两颗原子弹，随后日本就投降了。因此，美帝国主义就吹牛说，它的原子弹是使日本投降的决定原因。这种说法是完全不符合事实的。美国所以要这样瞎说，只是为了抹煞苏联出兵消灭关东军对日本投降所起的决定作用。当时日本看到它的关东军已被苏联消灭，中国的人民解放军又大举反攻，眼看着它在中国大陆上的势力已不能保全，而且德国已经失败，它在世界上的形势更加孤立，所以它赶快表示投降，以便保留一部分力量来和美帝国主义勾结起来。因此使日本投降的原因决不是原子弹。美国的著名的战争贩子陈纳德，也公开说过日本投降和原子弹没有关系。他曾经对《纽约时报》记者说：“苏联参加对日战争是使战争加快结束的决定性的因素；即使原子弹没有投掷，结果仍是一样。”
    问：苏联也有原子弹么？
    答：苏联在一九四七年就有原子弹了。苏联外长维辛斯基曾经说过：“假若一旦不幸需要原子弹时，我们将会有必需的那样多的原子弹。”他在联合国大会政治委员会会议上，又警告那些不同意禁止原子武器的战争贩子们说：“战争贩子们的一切算盘都是不可靠的，他们忘记了炸弹是可以用炸弹来回敬的。”苏联始终坚持加强和平与国际合作的外交政策，因此，苏联虽有原子弹，但坚决主张禁止使用原子武器，并主张宣布第一个使用原子武器的政府为战争罪犯，这正是苏联坚持和平政策的表现。
    问：那些地方可能成为原子弹投掷的目标？
    答：制造原子弹是要花很多钱的，一颗原子弹要十亿到二十亿美元，合起人民币，就要几十万亿元。制造原子弹在技术上是极复杂的，美国制造最初的两颗原子弹就花了两三年功夫。制造原子弹是极不容易的事，因此，在使用原子弹时，只能用来对付很大的目标。像工业集中的大城市、大规模聚集在一起的舰队等，都可能成为投弹的目标。原子弹对于这些目标可能造成较大的伤害。但除此以外，就没有什么可以使原子弹充分发挥威力的目标了。
    在陆地战场上，无论人力和物力怎样集中，全都没有使用原子弹的必要。因为向一块阵地投掷原子弹，或许可以杀死这块阵地地面上的一小部分士兵，而并不能伤害离爆炸地点较远的士兵，和藏在地下壕或洋灰筑的暗壕里的士兵，这些士兵仍旧可以抵御敌人的攻击。至于对付炮台、飞机场里的飞机、战车列队等，那就更不好使用原子弹了。
    原子弹会不会用来轰炸普通中小城市、市镇、车站、公路上的载重汽车队、桥梁等目标呢？那是绝对不会的，因为那是更加不合算了。这就好像我们不会用杀牛刀去削铅笔是一样的道理。
    因此，无论怎样，原子弹的效用是很有限的。
    我们中国，和我们的盟邦苏联，地方很大，人口分散，工业分散，武器物资也可以分散，原子弹碰到这样的国家，就不会有什么作用。一九四五年六月，美国的“科学家委员会”的一个叫做“使用原子武器的社会的及政治的后果”的报告也说：“俄国和中国（由于它们领土的广大与人口的分散）是目前在原子武器的攻击下仍然能够存在的仅有的大国。”
    问：原子弹可以防御么？
    答：从来就没有不可防御的武器。战争的历史告诉我们：每有一种新武器发明出来，每次都很快地就会发明出防御的武器。防御原子弹的消极方法，是建筑巩固的防空壕。日本广岛和长崎被炸的情形，证明即使在靠近爆炸的地面，几尺厚的建筑物，对于原子弹的威力，就有相当的保护作用。人的死伤，多半是由于建筑物的崩塌，或蔓延的大火。如果有坚固的防空设备，就可以抵御这种轰炸。前面说过，长崎被炸的时候，有几百个人躲在防空壕里，没有受伤，就可证明，除了直接炸中以外，防空壕是能够保护人们免于伤害的。高地也可以防御原子弹。长崎被炸的时候，损失之所以比广岛少，据英国勃兰凯特教授著的《原子能的军事和政治后果》一书说，这主要就是由于长崎地面崎岖不平，高地遮避了城市的若干部分，使这些部分没有受到炸弹的威力的缘故。根据这种情形判断，如果有一座大山隔着，原子弹的威力当然就更难达到了。防御原子弹的积极方法，是第一，用轰炸机去轰炸敌方携带原子弹的飞机的起飞地；第二，用战斗机和高射炮布置严密的防空网，不让敌机飞进来。
    问：美国曾宣布，它还有比原子弹更厉害的武器，叫做氢原子弹，那是不是真的呢？
    答：这是吹牛皮吓唬人的。美国本来以为可以用原子弹来吓倒苏联和全世界人民，但看到这个法宝不灵了，所以才又提出什么“氢原子弹”来吓人。美国总统杜鲁门在今年一月三十日发表一个声明，叫原子能委员会继续进行关于所有原子武器的工作，其中包括氢原子弹。杜鲁门是故意这样说了来进行所谓神经战的。果然，美国帝国主义的许多造谣骗人的新闻记者就跟着大吹特吹，好像美国已经能造出氢原子弹。其实一直到今天，谁也没有造成功什么氢原子弹。美国有一位原子物理学家说，我们不能预言能不能造成氢原子弹，就算是可以造成的话，至少也要三年功夫才能造出一颗氢原子弹的雏形。
    一种武器还没有造出来，就预先宣布，这还是有史以来的第一次。杜鲁门为什么这样做呢？当然是故意放空气吓唬人罢了。从这件事，也可以看穿美帝国主义是一只纸老虎。
    问：我们应该怎样对付原子弹的恐吓呢？
    答：美帝国主义拿原子弹吓唬人；我国有些潜伏的反革命分子，也散布谣言，说原子弹怎样怎样厉害，甚至造出什么“割蛋队”的鬼话，使得人心不安。我们应该粉碎这种谣言和阴谋。我们要认清原子弹并不可怕，它绝不能决定战争的胜败，我们应该到处去宣传解释这些道理；但是因为原子弹是杀伤力很大的惨无人道的武器，我们应该坚决主张禁止使用，并宣布第一个使用原子弹的人为战争罪犯。
