The anti-American and aid-Korea movement is gradually deepening.
    Beijing schools launch extensive propaganda work

    [Report from this newspaper] The anti-American and aid-Korea propaganda movement in Beijing's universities and middle schools is steadily and deeply developing in all aspects.

    Peking University and Beijing Normal University Go Deep into Factories and Schools; Professors and Assistants Enthusiastically Participate in Propaganda

    In order to first mobilize the organized masses, Peking University and Beijing Normal University, in addition to some departments conducting street propaganda, have also gone deep into factories and schools for propaganda.

    For more than a week, various departments of Peking University have been going to various middle schools and factories to hold joint song and dance drama conferences or symposiums, helping middle school students to organize and establish fixed contacts with them, and often assisting and guiding them.

    During this period, professors at Peking University have also been organized and taken action. The trade union's Western Language Department grassroots group, in addition to writing articles, compiling short plays, and discussing current affairs this week, continued to participate in student propaganda teams. The information and lecture groups organized by the trade union group of the Physics Department have repeatedly gone to various government agencies, schools, factories, and mass gatherings in the past few days to publicize that the atomic bomb is not mysterious, not terrible, and cannot determine the war, as well as the reasons why we oppose the use of atomic bombs.

    At the Beijing Normal University's meeting of cadres for anti-American and aid-Korea work on the 14th, based on the current situation, it was decided that the future propaganda targets would shift from the general public to organized masses, going deep into schools, factories, government agencies, and mass organizations to carry out propaganda and promotion work on the basis of their original organizations, using forms such as symposiums and small-scale evening parties to raise the masses' awareness of American imperialism and their hatred of it. The meeting also established new institutions to meet this major task. On the morning of the 14th, more than 30 students were sent to various districts to understand the situation. All the students are now conducting in-depth studies based on various situations.

    All the teachers of the Chinese Department of Beijing Normal University also decided at the group meeting on the morning of the 15th to cooperate with the department's propaganda team and mobilize all to go to the factory for propaganda. At the meeting, department director Li Jinxi emphasized that propaganda work is the intellectuals' unshirkable responsibility at present. He was the first to sign up to join the department's Jianhua Printing Factory working group to attend the workers' group discussions and the meeting to denounce the atrocities of American imperialism. Other teachers also signed up one after another.

    Tsinghua's Rural Propaganda Has Good Results; Propaganda Teams Turn to Factories and Mines

    Since the 12th, all the students and some teachers of Tsinghua University have widely conducted anti-American and aid-Korea propaganda in the surrounding villages. Some held mass meetings, some held small gatherings, some conducted family visits, and some used the opportunity of early markets to conduct propaganda to the villagers, which was widely welcomed by the villagers. Many village leaders, village chiefs, primary school teachers, village cadres, and women automatically helped the propaganda team with their work.

    The propaganda methods that are most easily accepted by the villagers are the "pulling foreign films," comic dialogues, and explanations combined with comic strips. The villagers reflected: "We understand that the white devils (referring to the American devils) are the same as the Japanese devils. They will come to fight us. Our relationship with Korea is like houses next to each other. If one catches fire, we have to save it. First, we are neighbors, and second, we are afraid of burning ourselves!" An old man said: "If we want to keep these nine acres of land, we must help Korea fight American imperialism. I say, we should contribute people if we have people, and food if we have food. We should do a good job in production and sideline production. This time, our village must complete the task of delivering public grain, more than 400 shi, in two days." The patriotism of the peasants who have turned over a new leaf has also given the students a lot of education.

    Since the 14th, the school's propaganda teams have turned to factories and mines, going to Shijingshan, Changxindian, Liulihe, Qinghe, Nankou, and Fengtai, etc. The students are all taking voluntary action with high enthusiasm, holding the spirit of learning from the working brothers, and going to factories and mines in teams.

    Jiaotong University's Beijing Railway Institute Prepares to Hold Mass Meetings and "Train Propaganda"

    In order to conduct propaganda more deeply, Jiaotong University's Beijing Railway Institute, after contacting the district committees and police stations of various districts, decided to change the street propaganda method to holding mass meetings. It has negotiated with the district committee and police station of the Second District to hold four mass meetings of the Second District in the afternoon and evening of the 17th and 18th. On the 15th, it also held a program rehearsal meeting for each department; the school's propaganda department also collected the comics prepared by each department and held a comic exhibition. All teachers, students, and staff participated in the evaluation work. At the same time, the school will adopt the "train propaganda" method to carry out various propaganda activities using the Beijing-Tianjin trains. In this way, on the one hand, it can expand the scope of propaganda, and on the other hand, it can make passengers not feel lonely during the journey. It has already obtained the consent of the Beijing Branch of the Tianjin Railway Bureau and has been welcomed. The professors of the institute also came from the distant off-campus dormitories to participate in the propaganda preparation work. The staff are also actively preparing to go to the countryside. The Materials Engineering Department, the Economics Department, and the Russian Language Department were mobilized to conduct street propaganda on the 15th and 16th, respectively.

    The Propaganda Station of the Affiliated Girls' High School of Beijing Normal University is Welcomed; Hebei High School Holds Mass Entertainment Meetings to Promote Anti-Americanism

    The propaganda station set up by the Affiliated Girls' High School of Beijing Normal University on the crossroads is full of various comics and big-character posters exposing the aggressive crimes of American imperialism, which often attracts a large number of viewers. In the afternoon after school, speakers explain the content of the comics and conduct various performances. When it gets dark, the masses are reluctant to leave. On the afternoon of the 16th, a meeting with nearly a thousand people was held in the school. Many people from the neighborhood near the school came, supporting the old and carrying the young. In addition to a brief introduction to current affairs, the meeting also performed literary and artistic programs to promote anti-American and aid-Korea. Both of these propaganda methods can achieve good results.

    In addition to conducting street propaganda, Shandong Middle School and Hebei High School invited nearby people to hold anti-American and aid-Korea entertainment evenings on campus. At the first evening party in Hebei High School, an old lady said excitedly after listening to the propaganda: "It turns out that most of our family property is in the Northeast. No wonder American imperialism wants to invade the Northeast! We must not give our family property to it!" Another old lady said after listening to the method of making atomic bombs: "I said, how can nipples and chicks make atomic bombs (the secret agents used to promote it this way)! Isn't it also made of iron or something!"

    Xuanwai Dazhiqiao and Songyun Middle School went out for propaganda after considerable preparation. Datong Middle School and Wanzi Middle School are also stepping up their studies and actively preparing for propaganda work to educate themselves and go out for propaganda. On the 15th, Municipal No. 1 Middle School and Tsinghua students held an "Expanded Anti-American and Aid-Korea Literary and Art Joint Meeting" to exchange experiences. The Tsinghua representative pointed out in his speech: "We must work hard to learn current affairs and spread what we know to more people."

    Pingmin Middle School Corrects Deviations and Strengthens Current Affairs Studies on Campus

    In addition, Pingmin Middle School reviewed that the school has been in a chaotic state for a week. The students are busy going to the streets for propaganda, but they do not have enough understanding of the significance of this movement. Their own problems have not been solved, but the study of current affairs has been generally ignored, and the focus of activities has been placed on street propaganda. Students who admire, fear, and are friendly to the United States and do not care about the motherland still exist. They have not been mobilized. At the same time, the effect of going out for propaganda is not very good. After recognizing this deviation, the Standing Committee of the Pingmin Branch of the Committee for the Defense of World Peace and Opposition to American Aggression reorganized on the 13th, overcoming the shortcomings of a large and inflexible organization. According to the school's current actual situation, it was decided to put aside the off-campus propaganda for the time being and focus on the campus. First, it is necessary to strengthen the study of current affairs, so that students can study current affairs well and truly understand the significance of this movement, and then go out for propaganda.

　　抗美援朝运动逐步深入
    京市各学校展开广泛宣传工作
    【本报讯】北京市大中学校的抗美援朝宣传运动，正稳步地、深入地向各方面开展着。
    北大师大深入工厂学校教授讲助踊跃参加宣传
    北大、师大等校为了先把有组织的群众带动起来，除部分系级到街头宣传外，并深入工厂、学校进行宣传。
    北大各系级，一个多星期以前，即开始到各中学和工厂去开联合歌舞剧大会或座谈会。帮助中学同学组织起来，并和他们建立固定的联系。经常协助他们，带动他们。
    北大教授这时期也都组织、行动起来了。工会西语系基层小组本周除写文章，编短剧，研讨时事外，继续参加学生宣传队。物理系工会小组组织的资料及讲演两小组中，后者几天内曾数次到各机关、学校、工厂、群众场合宣传了原子弹不神秘，不可怕，不能决定战争以及我们为什么反对使用原子弹的理由。
    师大十四日召开的全校各单位反美援朝工作干部会议上，根据目前情况，决定了今后的宣传对象，从一般市民，转为有组织的群众，深入学校、工厂、机关和民众团体，在他们原有的组织基础上，进行宣传推动工作。采取座谈会讨论、小型晚会等形式，来提高群众对美帝的认识，和对美帝的仇视。该会并成立了迎接这一重大任务的新机构。十四日上午已派了三十多位同学到各区了解情况。全体同学现在正根据各种情况，进行深入的学习。
    该校中文系全体教员在十五日上午小组会上也决定配合该系学生的宣传队，全体动员到工厂去宣传。会上系主任黎锦熙强调宣传工作在目前是知识分子义不容辞的责任。他首先报名参加该系学生的建华印刷厂工作组，要出席工人同志的小组讨论会和控诉美帝暴行大会。其他教员也纷纷报了名。
    清华乡村宣传效果良好宣传队伍转向工厂矿山
    清华大学全体同学及一些老师，十二日起在周围乡村广泛地进行了抗美援朝的宣传。有的开群众大会，有的开片儿会，有的进行家庭访问，有的利用早集的机会向老乡们进行宣传，受到老乡的普遍欢迎。许多闾长、村长、小学教师及村干部、妇女都自动帮助宣传队进行工作。
    宣传的方式，以拉洋片、相声和结合着连环漫画的讲解最容易为老乡们所接受。老乡们反映说：“咱懂得了：白鬼子（指美国鬼子）和日本鬼子一码事，它是会来打咱们的。咱们同朝鲜好比挨着的房屋，那一所着了火都得救。一来是街坊，二来也怕烧了自己的呀！”一个老大爷说：“咱要保住这九亩地，就得帮朝鲜打美帝。我说啊，咱们有人出人，有粮出粮。搞好生产再搞副业。这回咱们村交公粮，四百多石两天就一定要完成任务。”翻身农民的爱国热情，也给了同学们不少教育。
    自十四日起，该校宣传队伍已转向工厂矿山。分头到石景山、长辛店、琉璃河、清河、南口和丰台等处。同学们都以志愿行动，高度热情，抱着向工人兄弟学习的精神，一队一队地走到工厂矿山去。
    交大京院筹开群众大会准备进行“列车宣传”
    交通大学北京铁道学院，为了宣传得更加深入，与各区区委会派出所联系后，决定把街头宣传方式改变为举办群众大会。已与二区区委会及派出所洽妥于十七、十八两日午后及晚上召开四次二区群众大会。十五日并举行了各系节目预演大会；该校宣传部也把各系准备的漫画收集起来，举行了漫画展览会。全校师生员工都参加评议工作。该校同时将采取“列车宣传”方式，利用京津列车进行各种宣传。这样，一方面可以扩大宣传的范围，同时可以使旅客在途中不感寂寞。已经取得天津路局北京分局的同意，并受到欢迎。该院教授们也从远远的校外宿舍赶来参加宣传准备工作。职工们也正积极准备下乡。材料工程系和经济系、俄专分别在十五日和十六日已出动到街头进行了宣传。
    师大女附中宣传站受到欢迎冀高开群众娱乐会宣传抗美
    师大女附中设置的十字街头的宣传站，贴满了各色各样暴露美帝侵略罪行的漫画及大字报，经常吸引了大批观众。下午课外时间，由演讲员解释漫画内容，并进行各项表演。天黑了，群众还不肯离去。十六日下午于校内召开了将近千人参加的大会。学校附近的老百姓，扶老携幼地来了很多。会上除作简短的时事介绍外，并表演了宣传抗美援朝的文艺节目。这两种宣传方式，都能收到很好的效果。
    山东中学、河北高中除进行街头宣传外，在校内邀请附近群众举行了抗美援朝娱乐晚会。在河北高中首次晚会上，一位老太太听了宣传后，激动地说：“原来咱们的家产多半在东北。怪不得美帝要侵略东北！我们决不能把家产送给它！”另一位老太太在听了原子弹的制法以后说：“我说奶头和小鸡怎么能造成原子弹（特务曾这样宣传）呢！还不也是铁什么的造成的么！”
    宣外达智桥嵩云中学经过相当准备，出外进行了宣传。大同中学、万字中学，也正在加紧学习，积极作宣传准备工作，以教育自己，并出外宣传。市立一中十五日与清华同学一起，举行了一个“扩大反美援朝文艺会师大会”，彼此交流了经验。清华代表讲话时指出：“要努力学好时事，把我们所知道的传播给更多的人民大众。”
    平民中学纠正偏向加强校内时事学习
    此外，平民中学检讨了一星期来学校里一直乱哄哄的，同学们忙着到街头进行宣传，但是自己对这个运动的意义认识得还很不够。自己本身的问题还没有解决，却普遍地把时事学习忽略了，把活动重点放在街头宣传。校内崇美、恐美、亲美，对祖国毫不关心的同学仍然存在着，他们还没有动起来。同时出去宣传的效果也就不是很好。在认识了这种偏向以后，保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会平中支会常委会遂在十三日重新加以改组，克服了机构庞大，运用不灵的缺点，根据该校目前实际情况，决定把校外宣传暂且放下，把重点放在校内，首先要加强时事学习，让同学们都好好学习时事，真正认清这次运动的意义，然后再到校外去。
