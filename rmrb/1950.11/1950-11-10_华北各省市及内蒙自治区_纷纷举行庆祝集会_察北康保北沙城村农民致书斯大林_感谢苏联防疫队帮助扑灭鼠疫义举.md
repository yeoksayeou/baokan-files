Xinhua News Agency, 8th: North China's provinces, cities, and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region warmly celebrated the 33rd anniversary of the Soviet October Socialist Revolution.

　　A thousand representatives from all walks of life in Taiyuan City also held a celebration gathering on the 7th. Soviet friends were also invited to participate. Lai Ruoyu, Secretary of the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Wang Shiying, Vice Chairman of the Provincial Government, Liu Shaobai, Vice Chairman of the Shanxi Provincial People's Congress Consultative Committee, and Wang Wenguang, Chairman of the Taiyuan City Branch of the China Democratic League, unanimously pointed out in their speeches: As the people of the whole country are struggling for the sacred task of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea to protect our homes and defend our country, the great construction achievements of the Soviet people over the past thirty-three years and their historical role in defeating imperialist armed intervention and eliminating German, Japanese, and Italian fascism have encouraged and strengthened our confidence and determination to oppose U.S. imperialist aggression.

　　More than 700 representatives from various agencies, organizations, troops, schools, and ethnic groups in Suiyuan Province held a celebration rally on the 7th. Gao Kelin, secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Suiyuan Provincial Committee, and Dong Qiwu, chairman of the provincial government, both delivered speeches.

　　Zhangjiakou City held a celebration gathering on the evening of the 7th and hosted a banquet for Soviet friends stationed in Zhangjiakou City. Many agencies, schools, and factories held meetings to celebrate. All the farmers in Beishacheng Village, Kangbao County, Chahar North, who were spared from the plague due to the help of the Soviet anti-epidemic team, wrote a letter to Marshal Stalin to express their respect. The letter said: "We celebrate the October Revolution Day with the same joy as we celebrate our National Day. All 340 farmers in our village extend our sincere greetings to you. At this time last year, the plague was attacking us. The Sun Yongfu family of seven all died within six days. We couldn't do anything about it and were so scared that we all ran to live in the mountains. Many people became ill from the cold and hunger. At this critical moment of life and death, you sent the life-saving Soviet anti-epidemic team to our desolate and cold grasslands to give us vaccinations, kill rats and fleas, and clean up our hygiene. The plague was quickly eradicated, and no one has died since. In 1945, you sent troops to defeat Japanese imperialism and saved us from the pit of fire. This is something we are so grateful for. These things make us clearly realize that the Soviet Union is the most faithful and reliable friend of the Chinese working people. When U.S. imperialism expands its war of aggression against Korea, we will surely unite with the Soviet people and peace-loving people all over the world, under your glorious banner, and under the leadership of our dear Chairman Mao, we will work hard in production and do our work well to stop the U.S. imperialist aggression and defend world peace, and use this to respond to your and the Soviet people's concern for us."

　　People in various parts of Inner Mongolia carried out enthusiastic celebrations on the 33rd anniversary of the October Revolution.

　　Various units stationed in Zhangjiakou in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region held lectures for young cadres and women cadres of government organizations on the 7th. The Inner Mongolia Sino-Soviet Friendship Association also published a special issue to celebrate. The Inner Mongolia Cultural Troupe, which recently returned to Zhangjiakou from Beijing, jointly performed a celebration party with members of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association. Ulanhot and Manzhouli City also held grand joint evening parties with Soviet侨 [Qiao - Overseas Chinese] and Korean ethnic groups participating at the same time.
