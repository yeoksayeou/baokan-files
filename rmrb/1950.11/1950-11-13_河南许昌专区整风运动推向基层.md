The county and district party member cadre rectification meetings (also absorbing a small number of non-party member cadres and township cadres) in Xuchang Prefecture, Henan Province, were convened on the basis of rectification at the provincial and prefectural levels. Focusing on the specific circumstances of each county's work, the rectification focus of each county differed somewhat, but the rectification steps were generally as follows: starting with summarizing and inspecting work, the county party committee responsible cadres took the lead in inspection,展开开展criticism and self-criticism, exposing various deviations in cadres' work style and policy implementation; seizing the prominent and widely existing problems, analyzing them, and improving cadres' policy and ideological level through analysis and criticism; implementing the spirit of rectification, studying and formulating methods to improve work.

　　　　　Two Links in County and District Rectification

The progress of the rectification meetings in various counties proved that before the county and district rectification meetings, the responsible cadres of the county party committee should first, based on the inspections and summaries in the previous rectification movements of the provincial and prefectural committees, and the common and prominent problems in the central work of the county, prepare a well-prepared report with a high degree of self-criticism, rich content, and analytical criticism. This is an important key to the smooth development of the rectification movement. The benefits are: the report itself points out the direction of the rectification movement with facts, making it easier to guide everyone to inspect the central problems in the main work; at the same time, the self-criticism of the main responsible cadres can eliminate the ideological concerns of the cadres, encourage cadres to展开开展criticize and self-criticize, deeply inspect work, and inspect ideological style. At the beginning of the rectification in Lushan County, the leading cadres' report was substantial and powerful, and the self-criticism was profound. The rectification enthusiasm of the cadres attending the meeting was greatly improved, and they dared to criticize the leaders and actively inspect themselves. The rectification in Yancheng County took a detour, the basic reason being that the county party committee's inspection report was unclear in its center, empty and weak; the cadres attending the meeting also conducted general inspections, without touching the edges, piecemeal presentation of materials, unable to delve into them, delaying the progress of the movement.

Due to the low ideological level of the cadres and the lack of analytical ability, after a large number of materials on commandism in work were exposed, a situation often arose where it was difficult to improve. At this time, it is necessary to repeatedly study documents in light of reality; but the main key to deepening and improving is to organize large-group discussions, inspire each other, concentrate firepower, systematically inspect the work of one unit, or conduct typical analysis of a certain event, in order to recognize the root causes and harms of commandism. The general law of ideological struggle against commandism among district and township cadres is: after initially criticizing commandism, most people think: "Although commandism is not good, it can achieve results." When the harm of commandism is further criticized and recognized, a new depression arises: doubts about the mass line; lack of confidence and courage in future work. Therefore, it is important at this time to concentrate advanced experience, compare the good with the bad, and use living examples of following the mass line to completely defeat the deep-rooted influence of commandism on cadres. Most counties concentrated on successful experiences in their work during the rectification and organized typical speeches, which were very effective. Wu Jianguo, vice chairman of the Ciguo District Farmers' Association in Xiangcheng, introduced at the conference how he first learned cotton planting technology from old farmers when mobilizing cotton planting, personally helped the masses plant in the fields, organized the masses to visit the fields, and patiently used facts to persuade and educate the masses; there was no habit of accumulating manure and picking dung in the village, he first carried a basket to pick dung, leading to a upsurge of dung picking in the whole village. The several villages he led had an exceptionally good harvest this autumn, and were warmly supported by the masses. When he reported, the cadres in the venue listened attentively, and reflected after the meeting: "It's better than going to class for a few days." The worker and peasant cadres who originally lacked confidence said: "Lao Wu is illiterate and cannot write a report, but production is so good. As long as we work hard, we can do it." The cadres from intellectual backgrounds said: "I think my work is relatively in-depth, but it's far behind Lao Wu." The cadres found concrete goals to strive for, their confidence increased, and their enthusiasm was high.

　　　　　Main Gains

In the inspection of major tasks such as production, river management, and summer conscription, the counties systematically criticized and resolved two widespread problems with emphasis:

First, in the leadership of the county party committee, there were many task deployments, but little inspection and specific help for the lower levels. Instead of combining the specific local conditions to carefully study how to implement policies, it was "only about results, regardless of difficulties," and disregarding objective circumstances, limiting the time to complete tasks. This bureaucratic leadership style fueled the purely task-oriented views of district and township cadres, treating the masses with a simple, crude, and coercive command style, without patiently persuading and waiting for the masses to become aware. In the process of correcting commandism, cadres had various ideological resistances, such as: "Although commandism is not good, it can complete tasks," "The masses have low awareness, and persuasion and mobilization are useless," "The roughnecks have no working ability, and there is no other way but to deduct from people and beat people." In response to the above situations, the meeting conducted criticisms one by one, and further sought out the root causes of commandism, which lay in: a weak mass perspective, irresponsible work, fear of failing to complete tasks, and unwillingness to do in-depth persuasion and mobilization work; unclear policy thinking, handling affairs solely based on personal experience, and resorting to coercion when things didn't work out; not considering and analyzing the opinions of the masses, and even putting on airs and showing off in front of the masses. Its ideological essence is an old social ruling class ideology that stands above the masses. The evil consequences of commandism seriously damage the interests of the people and isolate the party and the people's government from the people. Taking the mobilization of silkworm rearing in Lushan County this autumn as an example. According to the experience of the local people, silkworm rearing in autumn is mostly unsuccessful. Some cadres ordered the masses: "If you don't raise them, we will ask others to raise them, and you will have to help; after the silkworms are harvested, it has nothing to do with you." The masses were forced to raise them. But when the silkworms went uphill, the secretary of the fourth district committee ordered the masses to catch pests on the mountain, regardless of whether they were raising silkworms or not. Those who could not catch them would be fined for catching them for three consecutive days. Cadres in Longwangmiao Township even stipulated: "Those who cannot catch 10,000 pests are not allowed to go down the mountain," forcing the masses to catch frogs in the river to complete the task. As a result, more than 90% of the silkworms did not produce cocoons, wasting a lot of labor and causing serious dissatisfaction among the masses.

Secondly, they seriously studied and specifically recognized the strong demands of peasants for developing production after the completion of land reform (more than 90% of the areas in the whole region have been completed); criticized the agricultural socialist thinking remaining in the cadres' minds, and the resulting violations of policies that did not guarantee private property rights, restricted the freedom of lending, renting, and buying and selling land in rural areas, and that "let the poor peasants benefit and the middle peasants suffer" in production mutual aid, which seriously affected the production enthusiasm of the peasants; criticized the formalistic tendencies of forcibly forming large groups in mutual aid without focusing on developing production, but pursuing superficial numbers; and the self-flowing theories of production without policies and production without leadership, and realized the direction of rural production: "Organize and develop production, so that the lives of peasants gradually become prosperous."

However, the resolution of various problems and the depth of study in various departments are unbalanced. From a policy point of view: the counties have deeply studied the direction of rural production; for the policy of uniting middle peasants in solving the remaining problems of land reform, some counties have not achieved a thorough solution, and there are still remnants of erroneous thinking that they are willing to admit mistakes politically, but unwilling to provide economic compensation, fearing that "poor peasants will suffer," and neglecting the unity of middle peasants. Furthermore, the leaders of the counties have paid attention to a large number of rural production problems, but have neglected overall leadership, and the agricultural production problems in various districts have been well resolved, but the work of small towns and county organs has been poorly inspected.

　　　　　Implement the Spirit of Rectification in Daily Work

On the basis of inspecting and criticizing past work, the counties have earnestly studied ways to improve future work. Summarizing, the main points are as follows:

(1) Hold representative meetings well, earnestly report work to representative meetings at all levels, encourage representatives to boldly criticize and inspect work, closely link the party and the government with the masses, and often obtain the supervision of the people. (2) Implement the spirit of criticism and self-criticism in daily work. Regularly inspect work to understand the situation, and organize inspection teams to become assistants to the leadership of the county party committee. In the inspection, hold more small-scale seminars and representative meetings of activists to listen to the opinions of the masses of all strata to enrich leadership. (3) Overcome the leadership style of rushing to complete tasks and blindly engaging in large-scale construction. The county and district party committees should personally participate in specific leadership with emphasis, and obtain experience to guide the entire region.

(4) Strengthen organization and discipline, and rewards and punishments should be timely and clear. Timely commend model deeds of following the mass line and close contact with the masses; those who have been repeatedly taught and refuse to change, and those who violate laws and regulations, shall be subject to disciplinary sanctions.

　　河南许昌专区整风运动推向基层
    本报记者　力文
    河南省许昌专区各县的县区党员干部整风会议（并吸收少数非党员干部及乡干部参加）是在省、地委两级整风的基础上召开的。针对各该县工作中的具体情况，各县整风重点，虽有所不同，整风步骤则大体是：从总结检查工作入手，县委负责干部带头检查，展开批评与自我批评，揭发干部工作作风及执行政策中的各种偏差；抓住突出的大量存在的问题，加以分析，从分析批判中，提高干部的政策思想水平；贯彻整风精神，研究与订出改进工作的办法。
            县区整风中的两个环节
    各县整风会议的进程证明：在县区整风会议前，县委负责干部首先应根据省委、地委历次整风中的检查总结，与本县中心工作中的普遍而突出的问题，准备作好一个具有高度自我批评精神、内容充实、有分析批判的启发报告。这是整风运动顺利展开的重要关键。其好处是：启发报告的本身，用事实指出了整风运动的方向，便于引导大家去检查主要工作中的中心问题；同时主要负责干部的自我批评，可以消除干部的思想顾虑，鼓励干部展开批评与自我批评，深入检查工作，检查思想作风。鲁山县整风之初，领导干部的启发报告充实有力，自我批评深刻，到会干部的整风情绪大为提高，敢于批评领导和主动检查自己。郾城县的整风走了一段弯路，基本原因是：县委的检查报告，中心不明确，空泛无力；到会干部也就泛泛检查，摸不着边际，零星的摆材料，钻不下去，延迟了运动的进展。
    由于干部思想水平不高，分析能力差，当揭发出工作中的命令主义的大量材料后，常出现一种苦于不得提高的情况。这时候联系实际，反复学习文件是必要的；但深入与提高一步的主要关键则是组织大组讨论，相互启发，集中火力，系统的检查好一个单位的工作，或对某一事件进行典型分析，以认清命令主义的产生根源及危害。区乡干部对命令主义思想斗争的一般规律是：初步批判命令主义后，多是认为：“命令主义虽不好，能做出成绩来啊”，及至进一步批判和认清了命令主义的危害，却又产生了新的苦闷：对走群众路线怀疑；今后工作缺乏信心和勇气。因之这时候重要的是集中先进经验，以好比坏，用走群众路线的活榜样，彻底击溃命令主义对干部的根深蒂固的影响。整风中多数县集中了工作中的成功经验，组织了典型发言，收效很大。襄城茨沟区农会副主席吴建国，在大会上介绍了发动种棉时，他怎样首先向老农学习种棉技术，亲自到田间帮助群众种植，组织群众田间参观，耐心的用事实说服教育群众；村中无积肥拾粪习惯，他先背起筐子拾粪，带起全村的拾粪热潮。他领导的几个村，今秋生产格外好，获得群众的热烈拥护。他报告时，会场中干部出神的静听，会后反映：“比上几天课都强”。原来缺乏信心的工农干部说：“老吴也不识字，写不了报告，生产搞得这样好，咱只要下力干，也能办到。”知识分子出身的干部说：“我觉得自己工作比较深入了，比起老吴还差得远。”干部找到了具体的努力目标，信心增加，情绪高涨。
            主要收获
    各县在检查生产、治河、夏征等主要工作中，有重点的系统的批判与解决了普遍存在的两个问题：
    一是县委领导上，布置任务多，对下级检查和具体帮助少。不结合当地具体情况，认真研究如何贯彻政策，而是“只要成绩，不管困难”，不看客观情况，限时间完成任务。这种官僚主义的领导方式助长了区乡干部的单纯任务观点，不耐心说服与等待群众的觉悟，以简单粗暴的强迫命令作风对待群众。纠正命令主义的过程中，干部思想上有多种抵触，诸如：“命令主义虽不好，但能完成任务”、“群众觉悟低，说服动员不顶事”、“大老粗没有工作能力，不扣人，不打人，别无办法”。会议针对以上情况，一一进行批判后，并进一步寻找出命令主义产生的根源，在于：群众观点薄弱，工作不负责，怕完不成任务，又不愿做深入的说服动员工作；政策思想不明确，单凭个人经验办事，办不通就强迫命令；对群众意见不考虑分析，甚至在群众面前摆架子，抖威风。其思想实质是一种站在群众之上的旧社会统治阶级思想。命令主义的恶果，严重损害人民利益，隔绝党、人民政府与人民的联系。以鲁山县今秋动员养蚕工作为例。当地群众的经验，秋季养蚕多不收。有些干部却命令群众：“你们不养，就叫别处来养，你们还得帮助；秋后收了蚕，与你们无干”，群众被迫养了。但蚕上坡时，四区区委书记又命令群众不管是否养蚕，一律上山捉害虫，捉不住者再罚连捉三天。龙王庙乡干部甚至规定：“捉不到一万个害虫，不准下山”，逼得群众下河捉青蛙，来顶交任务。结果百分之九十以上的蚕没成茧，浪费民力很大，引起群众严重不满。
    其次是认真研究与具体认清了土地改革完成（全区百分之九十以上的地区已经完成）后，农民发展生产的强烈要求；批判了残存在干部中的农业社会主义思想，和由此产生的不保障私有财权，限制农村中借贷、出租、买卖土地等自由，以及在生产互助中“让贫农沾光，中农吃亏”等严重影响农民生产情绪的违犯政策行为；批判了不从发展生产着眼，而是追求表面数字的强制互助编大组等形式主义偏向；与生产不用政策，生产不用领导的自流论错误，认识了“组织起来，发展生产，使农民生活逐渐走上富裕”的农村生产方向。
    但是，各项问题的解决，与各部门的学习深度，是不平衡的。从政策上看：各县对农村生产方向研究深刻；对于解决土改遗留问题中的团结中农政策，有些县则未获彻底解决，仍残存着愿意政治上认错，不愿经济赔偿，怕“贫农吃亏”，而忽略对中农的团结等错误思想。再即是，各县领导上注意了大量的农村生产问题，而忽略了全面领导，各区农业生产问题解决得好，但小城镇和县机关的工作检查很差。
            把整风精神贯彻到日常工作中去
    在检查与批判过去工作的基础上，各县均切实研究了改进今后工作的办法。归纳起来，主要的有以下几点：
    （一）开好代表会，认真向各级代表会报告工作，鼓励代表大胆的批评检查工作，密切党和政府与群众的联系，经常取得人民的监督。（二）把批评自我批评的精神贯彻到日常工作中去。经常检查工作了解情况，组织检查小组，成为县委领导上的助手。在检查中多开小型座谈会、积极分子代表会，倾听各阶层群众意见，以丰富领导。（三）克服为赶任务、大轰盲干的领导作风，县、区委要亲自动手，有重点地进行具体领导，取得经验指导全区。
    （四）加强组织性与纪律性，赏罚及时而严明。及时表扬走群众路线与群众密切联系的模范事迹；对三令五申，屡教不改，违法乱纪者，予以纪律制裁。
