Xinhua News Agency, New York, 1st TASS dispatch: The Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly continued its debate on the draft "Declaration on the Elimination of the Threat of a New War and the Strengthening of Peace and Security Among Nations" proposed by the Soviet Union on the afternoon of October 30th.

The first speaker was Israeli representative Rafael, who opposed the Soviet proposal and supported most of the clauses of the seven-power proposal. Following the American line, he asserted that the atomic bomb issue must be secondary to the issue of aggression. Rafael criticized the seven-nation proposal only because the words contained in it regarding "incitement to domestic conflict" lacked the same precision as the definition of aggression.

Ecuadorian representative Quevedo protested that the seven-nation proposal failed to condemn various forms of interference in internal affairs.

The Bolivian representative spoke on behalf of the proponents of the seven-nation proposal, assuring Quevedo that the proposal did not imply any limitation on condemning interference in internal affairs.

At this point, the Chairman announced the end of the general debate.

The Committee then voted on the Soviet-proposed draft peace declaration section by section.

The British delegation announced that it would vote against the entire proposal and also against each of its sections.

The committee rejected the first section of the preamble, which emphasized that the most important task of the United Nations was to maintain international peace and security and strengthen friendly relations among all peoples, by a vote of 13 in favor, 25 against, and 15 abstentions.

At the request of the Chilean delegation, the Political Committee, disregarding the objections of the Soviet delegation, decided to vote on the second section in two parts, with the aim of splitting the Stockholm Appeal issue. The committee rejected the first half of the second section by a vote of 16 in favor, 23 against, and 16 abstentions. This part read: "The General Assembly hereby expresses its firm determination to eliminate the threat of a new war and supports the indomitable will of the peoples for peace." Subsequently, the committee also rejected the remainder of this section, which stated: "As expressed by the hundreds of millions of people who signed the Stockholm Appeal." Five votes were in favor of this part of the section, 43 against, and seven abstained.

The third section was rejected by a vote of six in favor, 29 against, and 21 abstentions. This section condemned the use of atomic weapons as "the most serious international crime against humanity."

The last section of the preamble was rejected by a vote of 12 in favor, 35 against, and nine abstentions. This section declared that, in view of the events currently taking place in Korea and other Pacific regions, it was even more urgent to strengthen peace.

The Political Committee then rejected the first section of the operative part of the Soviet proposal, which condemned propaganda that advocated a new war, by a vote of seven in favor, 38 against, and 12 abstentions.

The first part of the second section of the operative part, which called for the unconditional prohibition of atomic weapons, was rejected by 32 votes against, nine in favor, and 14 abstentions. The second part of this section, which declared the first government to use atomic weapons to be a war criminal, was also rejected by 35 votes against, five in favor, and 18 abstentions.

The Political Committee then rejected the recommendation that the permanent members of the Security Council conclude a peace pact by a vote of 11 in favor, 33 against, and 11 abstentions. The last section of the Soviet proposal, which stipulated a one-third reduction in armaments, was also rejected by a vote of 41 against, five in favor, and ten abstentions.

The Chairman then proposed that the seven-nation proposal be put to a vote.

Soviet representative Malik proposed several amendments, explaining that the purpose of these amendments was to strengthen the seven-nation proposal and make it an effective tool for peace. Malik suggested that in the preamble, the condemnation of "any aggression – whether open aggression or aggression by inciting domestic conflict –" should include condemnation of "all forms of intervention in internal war." He also proposed adding to the preamble a section declaring that the use of atomic weapons as weapons of aggression and mass destruction of people was incompatible with the qualifications of a member of the United Nations and violated the conscience and honor of mankind. Malik further suggested that the provision in the operative part of the proposal regarding rapid joint action to stop aggression should further state that such action should be taken in accordance with the provisions of Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter. Other amendments proposed by Malik to the operative part of the seven-nation proposal stipulated the unconditional prohibition of atomic weapons and the implementation of strict controls on the ban, stipulating that a declaration in favor of disarmament should be implemented in the coming year, and stipulating that the government that first used atomic weapons or any other weapon of mass destruction should be condemned as a war criminal.

Canadian representative Pearson urged the Chairman to rule that the Soviet amendments were unacceptable. His excuse was that these amendments were the same as the Soviet proposal that the committee had just rejected. But the Chairman said he could not make any ruling until the text of the Soviet amendment was presented. Dutch representative Goodhart, speaking on behalf of the proponents of the seven-nation proposal, proposed a recess so that the amendments could be studied. The Political Committee then adjourned and reconvened on November 1.

　　联大政委会在美英集团操纵下
    竟否决苏联和平提案
    【新华社讯】塔斯社纽约一日电：联合国大会政治委员会于十月三十日下午继续辩论苏联所提出的“制止新战争威胁、巩固世界和平与安全的宣言”草案。
    第一个发言的是以色列代表拉非尔，他反对苏联的提案而赞成七个提案的大部分条款。他追随着美国的方针断言，原子弹问题必须居于侵略问题之次。拉非尔批评七国提案只是因为其中所包含的关于“煽动国内冲突”的话缺乏像侵略的定义一样的精确性。
    厄瓜多尔代表奎维铎抗议称，七国提案未能谴责各种各样对内政的干涉。
    玻利维亚代表代表七国提案的提案人说话，他向奎维铎保证说，提案并不意味着任何对于谴责干涉内政的限制。
    至此，主席遂宣布一般辩论结束。
    委员会于是逐节表决苏联所提的和平宣言草案。
    英国代表团宣布，它将投票反对整个提案，而且也反对它的每一节。
    委员会以十三票赞成、二十五票反对、十五票弃权否决了序言的第一节，这一节着重指出联合国的最重要的任务是维持国际和平与安全和巩固各族人民之间的友好关系。
    在智利代表团的请求下，政治委员会不顾苏联代表团的反对，决定把第二节分两部分表决，其目的在分裂斯德哥尔摩宣言问题。委员会以十六票赞成、二十三票反对、十六票弃票，否决了第二节的前半部，这一部分是“大会兹表示其制止新战争威胁的坚定决心，并支持各国人民对于和平的不屈不挠的意志”。随后委员会又否决了这一节的其余部分，这部分说：“像在斯德哥尔摩宣言上签名的数亿人民所表示的那样”。五票赞成这一节的这一部分，四十三票反对，七票弃权。
    第三节以六票赞成、二十九票反对、二十一票弃权遭否决，这一节谴责使用原子武器为“对人类所犯的最严重的国际罪行”。
    序言的最后一节以十二票赞成、三十五票反对、九票弃权遭否决，这一节宣称，鉴于目前在朝鲜以及其他太平洋地区所发生的事件更加迫切需要加强和平。
    政治委员会然后以七票赞成、三十八票反对、十二票弃权否决了苏联提案实效部分的第一节，这一节谴责那种赞成新战争的宣传。
    实效部分第二节的第一部分要求无条件禁止原子武器，以三十二票反对、九票赞成、十四票弃权遭否决。这一节的第二部分宣布第一个使用原子武器的政府为战争罪犯，亦以三十五票反对、五票赞成、十八票弃权遭否决。
    政治委员会随后以十一票赞成、三十三票反对、十一票弃权，否决了安理会常任理事国缔结和平公约的建议。苏联提案的最后一节是规定裁减军备三分之一，也以四十一票反对、五票赞成、十票弃权，遭到否决。
    主席继而提议将七国提案付诸表决。
    苏联代表马立克提出若干修正，并解释说，这些修正案的目的在加强七国提案，并使之成为有效的和平工具。马立克建议：在序言中，谴责“任何侵略——不论是公开进行的侵略，还是以煽动国内冲突的办法进行的侵略——”应包括谴责“各种形式的对内战的干涉”。他并提议在序言中增加宣布利用原子武器作为侵略及大规模毁灭人民的武器不合乎联合国会员国资格并违反人类的良心与荣誉一节。马立克进一步建议提案的实效部分中关于迅速联合行动以制止侵略的规定应进一步声明应按照联合国宪章第七章的各项规定采取这种行动。马立克对七国提案实效部分提出的其他修正案规定无条件禁止原子武器并对禁令实行严格的管制，规定在来年中实施赞成裁减军备的宣言，规定斥责首先利用原子武器或任何其他大规模毁灭性武器的政府为战争罪犯。
    加拿大代表皮尔逊力请主席裁决苏联的各项修正案为不能接受。他的借口是这些修正案和委员会刚刚否决的苏联提案相同。但主席说，在苏联修正案案文未提出前，他不能作任何裁决。荷兰代表古德哈特代表七国提案的提案国发言，提议休会，以便能够研究各项修正案。政治委员会于是宣告休会，至十一月一日再复会。
