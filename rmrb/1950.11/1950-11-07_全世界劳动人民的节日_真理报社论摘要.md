Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 5th (TASS): Pravda published an editorial titled "The Festival of Working People of the World," discussing the preparation of the Soviet Union and the working people of the world to celebrate the 33rd anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution.

The editorial stated that the Great October Socialist Revolution had dealt a fatal blow to the world capitalist system, and in contrast to the declining and disintegrating capitalist system, it brought a socialist system that would give mankind the happiness of communist victory. Despite the attempts by the leaders of the capitalist world to strangle the young Soviet Republic by using armed intervention, economic blockade, and subversive activities, the Soviet state overcame all difficulties and developed into a powerful force, becoming a strong factor in the world. The Soviet people, led by the party of Lenin and Stalin, have transformed our motherland from a backward country into an advanced country, and from an agricultural country into an industrial country in a very short period of history.

Pravda continued, the historic victory won by the Soviet people in the Great Patriotic War has particularly powerfully demonstrated the superiority of the socialist system and the Soviet social system over the capitalist system and the capitalist social system. Hundreds of millions of people have believed from their own experience that only the socialist country is the true defender of all the enslaved and oppressed people, and only the Soviet state has crushed the forces of the murderous aggressors. The article went on to say that the Soviet Union now stands at the forefront of the powerful camp of peace and democracy, and its consistent policy of peace has won the enthusiastic support of hundreds of millions of peace-loving people in capitalist countries.

The editorial pointed out that the Soviet people are greeting the 33rd anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution in a situation of rapid economic and cultural progress. The entire country is permeated with a noble spirit of creation. The pre-war production level has long been exceeded, and the pace of development of the Soviet national economy is accelerating year by year, quarter by quarter, and month by month. The world has never seen such a large-scale construction project as the one currently underway in the Soviet Union. The Stalin construction projects on the Volga River, the Dnieper River, and the Amu Darya River—communist construction projects—are enormous. The welfare of the Soviet people is constantly increasing, and the cultural level is constantly improving. The great example of Soviet communist construction inspires the working people of the people's democratic countries who are fighting for socialism.

The editorial continued: The autocratic tyrants of the imperialist world are resorting to military adventures in an attempt to prop up the tottering position of capitalism and establish their world domination. The American imperialists are ready at any moment to flood the whole world with blood in order to satisfy their insatiable desires and plot the delusion of world hegemony. They have launched a frantic arms race and are preparing for a new world war. They have moved from preparing for aggression to open aggression, washing the land of the Korean people in blood, and sending more armed forces to suppress the national liberation movements in Malaya, Indochina, and other countries.

The ordinary people of the world all see that the policy of the imperialists is a policy of aggression and a policy of launching a new war. This policy is being met with increasingly resolute resistance from the masses of the people. A vivid proof of this is the great peace movement sweeping the globe, which has hundreds of millions of good people from all over the world. Hundreds of millions of people warmly support and support the Soviet Union's consistent peace policy. All peace-loving people regard the Soviet Union as the most powerful bastion of universal peace.

The editorial concluded: The 33rd anniversary of the Great October Revolution is a festival for the working people of the world. The Soviet people, united around the victorious banner of the Lenin-Stalin party, are greeting the 33rd anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution in a situation of peaceful creative labor and active struggle for peace and universal security. In the struggle for peace, the Soviet people are joined by the progressive humanity of the whole world. In recent days, the thoughts and feelings of the working people all over the world have been directed towards the Soviet Union and towards the great leader and teacher, Comrade Stalin. The great Stalin inspires them to move forward in the struggle of the working people of the world for peace, democracy and socialism.

　　全世界劳动人民的节日
    真理报社论摘要
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科五日电：真理报以“全世界劳动人民的节日”为题发表社论，论述苏联及全世界劳动人民筹备庆祝伟大的十月社会主义革命三十三周年纪念。
    社论称，伟大的十月社会主义革命已给世界资本主义制度一个致命打击，与日益衰落、日益解体的垂死的资本主义制度相对照，它带来了一个给人类以共产主义胜利的幸福的社会主义制度。尽管资本主义世界的头目们如何企图利用武装干涉、经济封锁和颠覆活动等来绞杀年青的苏维埃共和国，但是苏维埃国家却战胜了一切困难，而发展成了一股强大的力量，成了世界上一个强有力的因素。列宁和斯大林的党所领导的苏联人民已在历史上一个很短的时期中将我们祖国从落后的国家变成了一个先进的国家，从一个农业国变了一个工业国。
    真理报继称，苏联人民在伟大的卫国战争中所获得的历史性的胜利，已经特别有力地显示了社会主义制度、苏维埃社会制度对于资本主义制度、对于资本主义社会制度的优越性。亿万人民群众已经由他们自己的经验相信，只有社会主义国家才是全体被奴役、被压迫的人民的真正保卫者，只有苏维埃国家曾粉碎了嗜杀成性的侵略者的力量。该文继称，现在苏联站在强大的和平民主阵营的前列，它的一贯的和平政策获得了各资本主义国家里亿万和平斗士群众的热烈支持。
    社论指出，苏联人民正在经济文化急剧进展的情况下迎接伟大的十月社会主义革命三十三周年纪念。整个的国家都渗透着创造的崇高精神。战前生产水平早已超过了，苏联国民经济发展的步调正在逐年、逐季、逐月地加速。世界上从来就没有看见过像苏联目前进行的这样大规模的建筑工程。伏尔加河、第聂伯河和阿姆河上的斯大林建筑工程——共产主义建筑工程是巨大的。苏联人民的福利正在不断地增加，文化水平正在不断地提高。苏联共产主义建设的伟大榜样鼓舞了为社会主义而斗争的各人民民主国家的劳动人民。
    社论继称：帝国主义世界的专制暴君正在诉诸军事冒险，以图支撑资本主义的摇摇欲倾的地位与建立它们的世界统治。美国帝国主义者们时刻准备把全世界淹没在血泊中，以便满足他们贪求无厌的欲壑与图谋世界霸权的妄想。他们已经发动了疯狂的军备竞赛，而且正在准备新的世界大战。他们从准备侵略进到公开侵略，血洗朝鲜人民的国土，增派武装部队去镇压马来亚、印度支那与其他国家的民族解放运动。
    全世界的普通人民都看到：帝国主义者的政策乃是侵略政策、是发动新战争的政策。这种政策遭受到人民群众越来越坚决的反击。其生动的证明便是拥有世界各国亿万善良人民的、席卷全球的伟大和平运动。亿万人民热烈地拥护与支持苏联始终不渝的和平政策。一切爱好和平的人民，都把苏联看作普遍和平的最强大的堡垒。
    社论结语指出：伟大的十月革命三十三周年纪念日是全世界劳动人民的节日。团结在列宁——斯大林党的胜利旗帜周围的苏联人民，在和平的创造性劳动的情况下、在积极争取和平与普遍安全的情况下迎接伟大的十月社会主义革命的三十三周年。苏联人民在争取和平的斗争中，与他们同在一边的有着全世界的进步人类。在最近这些日子里，全球各地劳动人民的思想与感情都向着苏联、向着伟大的领袖与导师斯大林同志。伟大的斯大林在全世界劳动人民争取和平、民主与社会主义的斗争中鼓舞他们前进。
