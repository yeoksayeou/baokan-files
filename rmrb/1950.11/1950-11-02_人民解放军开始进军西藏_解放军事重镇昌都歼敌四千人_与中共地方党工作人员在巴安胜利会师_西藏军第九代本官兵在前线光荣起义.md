　　Xinhua News Agency, Kangzang Front, 1st: The great march to liberate Tibet has already begun. The People's Liberation Army, having crossed the Jinsha River, has liberated Qamdo County, a strategic military town in western Xikang and the gateway to Tibet. Sangge Wangdui, the Ninth Daiben (equivalent to a small regiment) of the Tibetan Army, led his troops in an honorable uprising at the front. The PLA annihilated 4,000 Tibetan troops in this area.
　　At the request of the Tibetan compatriots, the People's Liberation Army crossed the Jinsha River, Nujiang River, and Lancang River in multiple routes on October 7th, overcoming various difficulties such as terrain and climate, and advanced rapidly towards Qamdo. When a unit of the PLA reached Ningjing City in central Xikang on the 11th, Sangge Wangdui, the chief officer of the Ninth Daiben of the Tibetan Army, inspired by the correct ethnic policies of the Central People's Government and at the request of the lower-level officers and soldiers, honorably revolted, and was immediately warmly welcomed and treated favorably by the PLA. The PLA captured Qamdo at 4 PM on the 19th, capturing over 200 enemies, and the remaining defenders fled westward and northward from Qamdo. The PLA units pursued and launched a fierce encirclement and annihilation battle. By the 21st, all fleeing enemies were either annihilated or surrendered. According to preliminary statistics, this battle resulted in the total annihilation of the 3rd, 8th, and 10th Daiben, the majority or part of the 2nd, 4th, 6th, and 7th Daiben, and the successful effort to have the 9th Daiben revolt, totaling 4,000 Tibetan military officers and soldiers annihilated, including the capture of more than 20 officials and officers of the fourth rank and above, including Apeigaelun (the highest official of the Tibetan reactionary authorities stationed in Qamdo) dispatched to Qamdo by the Tibetan reactionary authorities. In addition, two British and two Indian nationals were captured. What these foreigners were doing in the Tibetan army is under investigation.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 1st: Qamdo Dispatch: The People's Liberation Army liberating Qamdo City, a strategic town in western Xikang, was warmly welcomed by the Tibetan, Hui, and Han people of the city. The Tibetan compatriots were filled with excitement and joy they hadn't felt in years, cheering and paying respects to the PLA soldiers passing by them in the Tibetan language. Many monks were in the welcoming line, including four local Living Buddhas. After the liberation of Qamdo, the order within the city is extremely good.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 1st: A unit of the People's Liberation Army advancing into the Kangzang area victoriously met with the local Party workers of the Communist Party of China in Ba'an (i.e., Batang) in central Xikang, and a grand meeting was held. Participating in the meeting were personnel from the CCP Kangzang Border Area Working Committee, PLA representatives, the East Tibet Democratic Youth League, the Batang County People's Government, and staff members of various people's organizations, local people, and lamas, totaling over 1,500 people. Many Tibetan compatriots from more than 20 *li* away came to participate. The people of the Batang area fired three salvos from the cannon left by Zhao Erfeng, the ethnic oppressor of the Qing Dynasty, to celebrate the great unity of the Tibetan and Han people. Pingcuo Wangjie, Secretary of the CCP Kangzang Border Area Working Committee, called on the Tibetan people in his speech to vigorously support the People's Liberation Army and drive the imperialist aggressor forces out of Tibet.
　　It should be noted that the East Tibet Democratic Youth League was a progressive group formed by local Communist Party members uniting progressive youths before the liberation of Batang, with organizations throughout Batang, Lihua, Yajiang, and other regions. In May of this year, the League led the Batang People's Self-Defense Armed Forces and nearby civilian forces to establish the "Batang Provisional Guard Office" to protect the people of Batang; and successively opened three primary and secondary schools, two elementary and advanced Tibetan language remedial schools, and a women's night school and a people's library in Batang, which were extremely welcomed by the local people. The League has played a great role in carrying out propaganda and education to the Tibetan compatriots and supporting the liberation of Tibet.

    【新华社康藏前线一日电】解放西藏的大进军业已揭幕。渡过金沙江的人民解放军已解放通往西藏的孔道、西康西部的军事重镇昌都县城。西藏军第九代本（相当于小团）桑格旺堆在前线率部起义。解放军在该地区共歼灭了西藏军队四千人。
    人民解放军应藏族同胞的请求，于十月七日分路渡过金沙江、怒江、澜沧江，克服了道路、气候等各种困难向昌都疾进。当解放军一部于十一日进抵西康中部宁静城时，西藏军第九代本主官桑格旺堆在中央人民政府正确民族政策的感召与下层官兵的要求下，光荣举义，当即受到解放军热烈欢迎和优待。解放军于十九日下午四时攻占昌都，俘敌二百余，其余守敌分向昌都以西、以北地区溃逃。解放军各路部队跟踪追击并展开猛烈围歼战。至二十一日，逃敌全部就歼或投降。据初步统计，此役计歼敌第三、八、十代本全部，第二、四、六、七代本大部或一部，并争取第九代本起义，共计歼灭西藏军官兵四千人，内生擒西藏反动当局派驻昌都包括阿培噶伦（西藏反动当局派驻昌都的最高官员）等四品以上官员及军官二十余名。此外，尚俘获英国人二名，印度人二名。这些外国人跑到西藏军队中去是干什么事情的，正在侦查中。
    【新华社重庆一日电】昌都讯：解放西康西部重镇昌都城的人民解放军受到全市藏、回、汉各民族人民热烈欢迎。藏族同胞洋溢着多年来从未有过的兴奋和喜悦，用藏语向经过身旁的解放军战士欢呼致敬。欢迎行列中并有许多僧侣，其中有当地的活佛四人。昌都解放后，城内秩序极为良好。
    【新华社重庆一日电】进军康藏地区的人民解放军某部在西康中部巴安（即巴塘）与中国共产党地方党工作人员胜利会师，并曾举行了隆重的会师大会。参加会师大会的有中共康藏边地方工作委员会工作人员、解放军代表、东藏民主青年同盟、巴安县人民政府及各人民团体工作人员和地方群众、喇嘛等一千五百余人。四乡的很多藏胞从二十余里内外赶来参加。巴塘地区人民搬出清代民族压迫者赵尔丰留下的大炮连放三响，欢庆藏汉人民的大团结。中共康藏边地工委书记凭错旺阶在讲话中号召藏族人民大力支援解放军，驱逐帝国主义侵略势力出西藏。
    按东藏民主青年同盟系于巴塘解放前由当地共产党员团结进步青年组成的一个进步团体，组织遍及巴塘、理化、雅江等地区。今年五月间，该盟曾领导巴塘人民自卫武装及附近民间武力，成立“巴塘临时警卫办事处”，保卫巴塘人民；并先后在巴塘开办中小学三所、初高级藏文补习学校两所及妇女夜校和人民图书馆，极为当地人民所欢迎。该盟在向藏胞进行宣传教育和支援解放西藏的工作上起了很大的作用。
