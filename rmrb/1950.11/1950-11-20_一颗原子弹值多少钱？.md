How Much Does an Atomic Bomb Cost?
    Comrades Tian Jian, Qin He, Zhao Xiang, and others wrote to inquire about the price of atomic bombs. Comrade Wen Jize replies as follows:
    According to the American magazine *The New Republic*, in an article titled "The Age of the Atomic Bomb" published in early August 1945, the first two atomic bombs manufactured by the United States cost $1 billion each. Another American material stated that the first two cost $2 billion each. The initial two were so expensive because they included long-term research and testing costs. Those manufactured later were cheaper. Curie's book, *I Want to Know About Atomic Bombs*, states that each atomic bomb costs 1 billion to 3 billion francs. Based on an exchange rate of 350 francs to the US dollar, this is approximately $3 million to $9 million, which refers to the price of atomic bombs manufactured later. The existing materials regarding the price of atomic bombs are mostly estimates and therefore not entirely consistent. The first few sentences of the answer to the sixth question in the article "Questions and Answers about Atomic Bombs" should be changed to the following for greater accuracy: "Manufacturing atomic bombs costs a lot of money. The first two atomic bombs manufactured by the United States cost $1 billion to $2 billion each, which is equivalent to tens of trillions of RMB. Those manufactured later still cost nearly $3 million to $9 million each, which is equivalent to approximately 90 billion to 270 billion RMB."

　　一颗原子弹值多少钱？
    田坚、秦禾、赵祥等同志来信询问原子弹价钱问题，兹由温济泽同志答复如下：
    据一九四五年八月初出版的美国《新共和》周刊《原子弹时代》一文中说，美国制造原子弹，最初的两颗，每颗值十亿美元。另一美国公布的材料则说最初两颗每颗值二十亿美元。最初两颗所以这样贵，是因包括了长期研究费及试验费在内的。以后造成的就便宜了。居里所写《我要知道原子弹问题》一书说，每颗原子弹值十亿到三十亿法郎，按一美元合三五○左右法郎计算，则约合三百万到九百万美元，这就是指的以后造成的原子弹的价钱。现有的关于原子弹价格的材料，多属估计性质，故不完全一致。《关于原子弹问答》一文第六个问题的答案的前几句话，改成这样，就较妥当些：“制造原子弹是要花很多钱的，美国最初造成的两颗，每颗值十亿到二十亿美元，合起人民币，就要几十万亿元；以后造成的，每颗也要将近三百万到九百万美元，合人民币约九百亿到二千七百亿元。”
