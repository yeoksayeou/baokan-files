Xinhua News Agency, New York, November 4th (TASS dispatch): The United Nations General Assembly Political Committee continued its discussion of the "Declaration on the Elimination of the Threat of a New War and the Consolidation of World Peace and Security" on November 3rd.

At previous meetings, the majority faction controlled by the US-UK bloc in the Political Committee rejected the Soviet proposal. After the Soviet proposal was rejected, the Political Committee adjourned to study the many amendments proposed to the joint proposal reflecting the views of the US delegation.

On November 3rd, the proposers of the joint proposal put forward a revised proposal, incorporating some of the amendments and suggestions. India became the eighth proposing country after its suggestion was redacted and adopted. India's original proposal suggested that UN member states report to the Secretary-General by March of next year their plans to reduce armaments and donate the funds saved thereby to the United Nations as a peace fund for the development of backward areas. The proposers of the joint proposal only accepted vague assurances, allowing for "reducing the manpower and economic resources used for armaments to a minimum," while deleting all references to the development of backward areas from the suggestion. These proposing countries also adopted some other minor textual changes, but the amendments proposed by the Soviet Union to transform this deceptive proposal into a practical and effective tool for consolidating peace were rejected. In addition to the joint proposal, the Committee also discussed the Chilean proposal, which stated that measures with a tendency to "isolate peoples" are "anti-peace propaganda."

The first speaker was the Greek representative, Cachmatis, whose speech was anti-Soviet.

Dutch representative Goedhart spoke on behalf of the various proposing countries of the joint proposal, attempting to justify the complete rejection of the Soviet amendments.

Soviet representative Vyshinsky, in response to the Dutch representative, said: The Greek representative used words in his anti-Soviet remarks that no UN representative should use. Then Vyshinsky said: It is unlikely that the Dutch representative's opposition to the Soviet Union is in good faith, because the Soviet Union has proposed an amendment against interference in civil wars.

The Soviet amendment stipulates that actions against aggression must comply with Chapter VII of the UN Charter (according to Chapter VII, the Security Council shall take such actions). Vyshinsky, in referring to the rejection of this amendment, asked: Is the Security Council now regarded as an illegal body?

Vyshinsky, in referring to the reason for opposing the Soviet declaration banning atomic weapons, which was that the declaration was too vague, pointed out: This declaration is only the first step, and there will be concrete measures later.

Vyshinsky then pointed out: When the Soviet delegation suggested condemning the propaganda of a new war, the majority of the Political Committee opposed it. However, the Bolivian proposal also had such a condemnation, and this proposal was praised. But in the revised joint proposal, this suggestion is gone again. Vyshinsky continued: Some delegations oppose this declaration simply because it was proposed by the Soviet Union, while a declaration proposed by another delegation is acceptable. Vyshinsky said: That's good, the Soviet delegation now abandons its suggestion to condemn the propaganda of a new war and supports the Bolivian suggestion to condemn the propaganda of a new war. Unless the majority of the Political Committee adopts the same attitude towards the Soviet delegation as the Greek representative, this should be acceptable to everyone.

The next speaker, Indian representative Rau, announced the withdrawal of the Indian suggestion. He explained that he was doing so reluctantly, because the Indian proposal had aroused hopes in many places that genuine disarmament measures could be adopted. However, he said: Some delegations have "persuaded" India that the method of allocating the costs of developing backward areas from military expenditures is "so valuable" that it should be fully studied.

French representative Lacoste then declared that he would support the Chilean proposal and the joint proposal.

The Bolivian representative attempted to explain the reason why the Bolivian original proposal to condemn the propaganda of a new war was not included in the joint proposal; he said: This proposal was not included because it is already included in the Chilean proposal.

Czechoslovak representative Pisek said: This debate fully proves that the supporters of the joint proposal do not want to reconcile their views with those of the Soviet Union, because they opposed the Soviet suggestions without seriously discussing them.

Canadian representative Pearson then denied that the opposition to the Soviet amendment was only because it was proposed by the Soviet Union. He said: If certain amended places...the wording is changed slightly, these amendments can be accepted. Pearson also pointed out that the Soviet suggestion to condemn interference in civil wars would raise the issue of defining the nature of war.

British representative Younger said: The amendment proposed by the Soviet delegation to prohibit interference in civil wars is unacceptable.

The next speaker was Syrian representative El-Ghouri; he asked whether this amendment prohibits interference carried out at the request of a legitimate government. Vyshinsky replied: It is an illusion to find ways in advance for everything that might happen. Regarding the definition of "civil war," Vyshinsky said: Pearson might agree to authorize the Security Council to determine the definition. Vyshinsky cited the American Civil War as a typical example, in which Britain attempted to interfere on the side of the slave owners against the peace-loving Northern states.

The Political Committee then began voting. The voting machine controlled by the United States not only rejected every Soviet amendment, but also gladly responded to the most illogical procedural requests of the US delegation. The Soviet amendment prohibiting interference in civil wars was rejected by five votes in favor, thirty-seven votes against, and ten abstentions. The Committee also rejected the Soviet amendment by seven votes in favor, twenty-five votes against, and twenty-one abstentions. This amendment declared: "The use of atomic weapons, as weapons of aggression and mass destruction, is contrary to conscience and incompatible with the status of a member of the United Nations."

The Soviet amendment stating that anti-aggression actions should comply with Chapter VII of the UN Charter was rejected by thirty-five votes against, six votes in favor, and eleven abstentions.

When voting on the substantive part of the eight-nation proposal, the Israeli representative suggested that the declaration regarding each country "agreeing to accept effective international atomic energy control implemented by the United Nations on the basis already adopted by the General Assembly," etc., be voted on separately. The Israeli representative suggested a separate vote on the phrase "on the basis already adopted by the General Assembly" in the declaration. Obviously, this procedural suggestion made it possible for countries to reach an agreement on a basis other than the infamous Baruch Plan that the United States had forced the General Assembly to accept. US representative Austin, after discovering this, rudely demanded that the chairman rule that the Israeli representative's remarks were out of order. Austin insisted that the entire sentence had only one meaning. The Israeli representative reluctantly withdrew his suggestion.

Vyshinsky then spoke, saying: Although the Soviet Union wants to oppose the entire section, because it is impossible to control something that has not been prohibited (referring to the atomic bomb), it believes that the Israeli suggestion is entirely logical, because that section has two meanings.

The Chairman retorted: Israel has withdrawn his suggestion. Vyshinsky said: Then, I will propose this suggestion again. Austin once again demanded that the suggestion be rejected. The Chairman put the suggestion to a vote, and Austin's servants obediently supported him.

The Committee rejected the Soviet amendment by thirty-five votes against, five votes in favor, and twelve abstentions. The amendment suggested that any government that first uses atomic weapons or any other weapon of mass destruction should be regarded as a war criminal.

The Committee also rejected the Soviet amendment condemning any form of propaganda for a new war by twenty-two votes against, sixteen votes in favor, and fourteen abstentions.

Finally, the Political Committee rejected the Soviet amendment stating that the reduction of armaments and the condemnation of propaganda for a new war have great importance for strengthening peace and security by twenty-three votes against, twelve votes in favor, and eighteen abstentions.

Then the Political Committee passed the entire eight-nation proposal by forty-seven votes in favor, five votes against, and one abstention (Yugoslavia).

The Committee then passed the Chilean proposal condemning "anti-peace propaganda, suggesting free exchange of information and ideas" by forty-three votes in favor and eight abstentions.

Vyshinsky said: The Soviet delegation's abstention does not mean that the Soviet Union opposes the proposal, but it indicates that the wording of the proposal and the references to previous resolutions of the General Assembly are unsatisfactory.

The Political Committee meeting then adjourned.

### 联大政治委员会三日会议上  通过旨在欺骗的联合提案  苏联所提出的修正案竟被否决

　　联大政治委员会三日会议上
    通过旨在欺骗的联合提案
    苏联所提出的修正案竟被否决
    【新华社讯】塔斯社纽约四日电：联合国大会政治委员会十一月三日继续讨论“制止新战争威胁，巩固世界和平与安全宣言”案。
    在以前的会议上，政治委员会中美英集团所操纵的多数派否决了苏联提案。苏联提案遭否决后，政治委员会即行休会，以便研究对反映美国代表团观点的联合提案所提出的许多修正案。
    十一月三日，联合提案的提案人提出了经修正后的提案，其中吸收了一部分修正案和建议。印度在它的建议被加以删削而采纳之后，变成了该提案的第八个提案国。印度原来的提案建议联合国各会员国在明年三月以前向秘书长报告其裁减军备并由此节约的款项捐献给联合国作和平基金以供发展落后地区之用的计划。联合提案的提案国仅仅接受了含糊其词的保证，允许“把用于军备上的人力与经济资源减至最小限度”，而将该建议上所有关于发展落后地区的话一概删去。这些提案国也采纳了其他一些细微的文字上的修改，但苏联为了把这个欺骗的提案化为巩固和平的实际有效的工具而提出的修正案却被拒绝了。除了联合提案之外，委员会所讨论的还有智利提案，该提案说，有“孤立人民”的倾向的措施是“反和平的宣传”。
    第一个发言的是希腊代表卡希马蒂斯，他的演说是反苏的。
    荷兰代表古德哈特代表联合提案的各提案国发言，他企图为完全拒绝苏联修正案辩解。
    苏联代表维辛斯基在答复荷兰代表以前说：希腊代表的反苏言论中，用了任何联合国代表都不容使用的词句。然后维辛斯基说：荷兰代表反对苏联的话很不可能是出于善意的，因为苏联提出的是反对干涉内战的修正案。
    苏联的修正案规定反对侵略的行动须符合联合国宪章第七章（按第七章规定由安全理事会采取这种行动），维辛斯基在谈到这个修正案被拒绝时问道：安理会是不是已经被看作是非法的机构了。
    维辛斯基在谈到以苏联所提禁止原子武器的宣言性质太空泛为借口而反对这个宣言的理由时指出：这个宣言只是第一步，以后还会有具体的措施。
    维辛斯基然后指出：当苏联代表团建议谴责新战争的宣传时，政治委员会的多数反对它。但是玻利维亚的提案也有这种谴责，而这个提案却受到称赞。可是在修正过的联合提案中，这个建议又没有了。维辛斯基继续说：某些代表团反对这个宣言仅仅是因为它是苏联提出的，另一个代表团提出的这个宣言却可以接受。维辛斯基说：那很好，苏联代表团现在放弃它的谴责新战争宣传的建议而赞成玻利维亚的谴责新战争宣传的建议。除非政治委员会的多数对于苏联代表团采取与希腊代表同样的态度，否则这该可以使大家接受了吧。
    下一个发言的印度代表劳氏宣布撤消印度建议，他解释道：他这样做实在是勉强的，因为印度的提案已在许多地方引起了真正的解除武装的措施可获通过的希望。但是，他说：某些代表团“说服了”印度，开发落后地区的费用从军备费用中拨付的办法是“这样的有价值”，应该予以充分的研究。
    法国代表拉哥斯特随后宣称：他将支持智利的提案以及联合提案。
    玻利维亚代表企图解释联合提案中未列入玻利维亚原来所提谴责新战争宣传的建议的理由；他说：这个提案没有列入，因为它已包括在智利的提案里了。
    捷克斯洛伐克代表彼塞克说：这次辩论充分证明：联合提案的支持者并不想使他们的意见与苏联的调协起来，因为他们没有严肃地讨论苏联的建议就加以反对。
    加拿大代表皮尔逊接着否认反对苏联的修正案只是由于它是苏联提出的。他说：如果某些修正的地方……措辞有些改变的话，这些修正案是可以被接受的。皮尔逊并且指出：苏联所提谴责干涉内战的建议会引起战争性质的定义问题。
    英国代表杨格说：苏联代表团所提出的禁止干涉内战的修正案是不能接受的。
    下一个发言人是叙利亚代表埃尔——古里；他问这个修正案是否禁止应一个合法政府的要求而进行的干涉。维辛斯基答道：要为一切可能发生的事而预先寻到办法，那是幻想。关于“内战”的定义问题，维辛斯基说：皮尔逊或许会同意授权安理会从事确定定义的工作。维辛斯基列举美国的内战作为一个典型的例子，在这个内战中，英国企图站在奴隶主一边来干涉爱好和平的北方各州。
    政治委员会随后开始表决。美国控制下的表决机器不仅否决了苏联的每一个修正案，而且欣然地响应了美国代表团的最不合逻辑的程序上的要求。苏联所提禁止干涉内战的修正案以五票赞成和三十七票反对及十票弃权被否决。委员会并且以七票赞成，二十五票反对及二十一票弃权否决苏联的修正案，这个修正案宣称：“使用原子武器、以及作为侵略和大规模毁灭的武器，是违背天良的，并且是与联合国会员国的资格不相容的。”
    苏联所提反侵略行动应符合联合国宪章第七章的修正案以三十五票反对、六票赞成、十一票弃权而遭否决。
    在表决八国提案的实效部分时，以色列代表建议将关于每个国家“同意在大会所已通过的基础上，接受由联合国实行有效的国际原子能管制”等等的宣言分开表决。以色列代表建议单独表决宣言上所称“大会所已通过的基础”这一段。显然地这个程序建议使各国有可能在美国所强迫大会接受的臭名远扬的巴鲁区计划以外的某种基础获致协议。美国代表奥斯汀发现这一点后就粗暴地要求主席裁决以色列代表的发言不合议事规则。奥斯汀硬说这一整句只有一个意思。以色列代表就歉然地收回了他的建议。
    维辛斯基随即发言称：虽然苏联要反对整个这一节，因为人们不可能管制没有被禁止的东西（指原子弹），不过它认为以色列的建议全然合乎逻辑，因为那一节是有两个意思。
    主席反驳称：以色列已收回他的建议。维辛斯基称：那末，我就再度提出这个建议。奥斯汀再一次要求否决这个建议。主席把这建议付诸表决，奥斯汀的仆从们顺从地支持了他。
    委员会以三十五票反对、五票赞成、十二票弃权否决了苏联的修正案。该修正案建议任何首先使用原子武器或任何其他大规模毁灭人类武器的政府应被视为战争罪犯。
    委员会并以二十二票反对、十六票赞成、十四票弃权否决苏联所提谴责任何形式的新战争宣传的修正案。
    最后政治委员会又以二十三票反对、十二票赞成、十八票弃权否决了苏联所提减缩军备和谴责新战争宣传对加强和平及安全具有巨大重要性的修正案。
    然后政治委员会就以四十七票赞成、五票反对、一票弃权（南斯拉夫）通过了整个八国提案。
    委员会然以后四十三票赞成、八票弃权通过了智利所提谴责“反和平宣传、建议自由交换情报和思想”的提案。
    维辛斯基称：苏联代表团弃权并不意味着苏联反对提案的意思，而是表明：提案的用字和提到大会以前的决议的地方是不能令人满意的。
    政治委员会会议到此即行休会。
