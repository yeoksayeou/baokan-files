　　Breaking Down Cliques to Jointly Resist America and Aid Korea
    A Record of Improved Relations Between the League and the Masses in the Senior Three Class of Beijing Baiman Girls' High School
    Chang Yucao
    The common hatred for American imperialism has sparked sincere friendship among the students. In the campaign to Resist America, Aid Korea, Protect Our Homes and Defend the Nation, the senior three students of Beijing Baiman Girls' High School have greatly improved the previous phenomenon of disunity among students after the accusation meeting, where they recognized the bloody crimes of American imperialism. At the accusation meeting, thirty-one students immediately expressed their desire to join the League, willing to unite better under the leadership of the Communist Youth League, to do a good job in resisting America and aiding Korea, and to study hard.
    In the past, the relationship between League members and the masses in the senior three class was very abnormal. League members engaged in cliquism, believing that the masses were backward, but they did not help them well. Instead, they did not associate with them, saying, "It's boring to talk to them." In their studies, League members only focused on their own grades and did not help the masses. In extracurricular activities, League members did not lead the masses to participate together. The attitude of individual League members was poor, causing dissatisfaction among the masses. Thus, the gap between League members and the masses was very deep. The masses never expressed opinions on the work in the class, and they rarely participated in League meetings or study group meetings. The atmosphere in the class was always inactive. Even during a trip to Tongzhou, only one or two members of the masses participated in the team formed by League members, while the masses formed their own team.
    After the high tide of the Resist America and Aid Korea movement was set off, all the high school students of Beijing Baiman Girls' High School held an accusation meeting at the beginning of this month. At the meeting, the students indignantly accused the atrocities of American imperialism, recognizing that there was only one common enemy in front of everyone, which was American imperialism, and that there was only one common task, which was "Resist America, Aid Korea, Protect Our Homes and Defend the Nation." Anything that affects the execution of this task should be resolutely abandoned; all personal grievances should be subordinate to this sacred task. Everyone should unite closely to fight the enemy. The senior three students then held a class accusation meeting. At the meeting, Liu Yichun, a student who usually had deep pro-American thoughts, said, "In the past, I would get angry when I heard League members say that the United States was an imperialist. I admired everything about America, and I even had photos of American stars hanging in my room. Today's accusation meeting has given me great enlightenment. I realized that American imperialism is a wolf in sheep's clothing. I was deceived by it before, which made it impossible for me and the League members to unite, and I couldn't concentrate on studying. Today, I am awake!" As she spoke, she burst into tears. Then many students, combined with their hatred for American imperialism, recognized the common enemy at present and reviewed that it was shameful to engage in cliquism and disunity in the past. League member Sun Yilin reviewed that she and Feng You had studied together since they were young, but after she joined the League, she felt that she was stronger than Feng You, and not only did she not help her well, but she also alienated her day by day. She sincerely said, "Feng You, please forgive me, let's be as good as we used to be!" She ran over and hugged Feng You, crying with remorse. League member Gao Zhifen said, "The reason why the relationship between the League and the masses was not good in the past was mainly our fault. We know that the work of League members taking the initiative to unite and help other students was not done well enough." Zeng Erhui and Fang Zhen, two League members, had not spoken to each other for more than a year because of a small matter. Now they understood each other and made up intimately. Student Jin Zonglu said, "I think the youth of the New China should love the motherland. In the face of the task of defending the motherland, there is no difference between us and the League members. We should learn from them and unite around the League, so when the League members took the oath yesterday, I also took the oath with them without hesitation." Student Zhang Guohua wanted to join the League in the past, but she never brought it up. At this meeting, she said, "The League is a revolutionary organization, and the League members are progressive and patriotic. I am a youth, and I should learn from them. I must strive to join the League." Student Li Yizhu also deeply reviewed herself: "I once told my classmates that I would not join the League as long as there was one person in the world who did not join. When my brother joined the Party, I even scolded him as a big bastard. Now I know I was wrong. I am simply not worthy of being a Chinese youth. I am too wrong." After she finished speaking, she was so excited that she fainted.
    The hearts of dozens of League members and young masses merged together at the meeting. After the League members made their self-criticisms, a total of thirty-one students who had not joined the League reviewed their past misunderstandings of the League before the meeting, and they all wanted to learn from the League members, learn from their exemplary behavior, and strive to join the League. The League members also enthusiastically shouted, "Welcome new comrades!" The students told the words buried in their hearts that they usually did not say. Many League members and non-League members hugged each other, moved to tears.
    After this accusation meeting, the relationship between the League and the masses has been greatly improved. Students who had never participated in any activities in the past enthusiastically joined the various groups under the Resist America and Aid Korea Protect Our Homes and Defend the Nation Working Committee, such as singing, quick-clapper talks, and comics. And they actively came out to take responsibility. Feng You and Zhu Yulin, two students, studied current affairs enthusiastically and actively in the study group meeting. After class, they went to Xinhua Bookstore to buy reference books, and they were the first to make comfort bags for the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army. Many students went back very late after class, working on comics, plays, and quick-clapper talks. The League members were very moved. Two Christian students sincerely wrote a letter to the propaganda committee member of the senior three League, saying that they used to think that League members discriminated against them, but now they realized that this was a misunderstanding. "In the current torrent of resisting America and aiding Korea, we should unite closely!" League members also actively invited students to participate in various meetings, such as study groups, and study groups, and discussed current affairs with students. What they knew, they patiently explained to them. In addition, League members often solicited opinions from the masses, and the masses frankly put forward opinions and criticisms. The gap between each other has indeed been broken, and they have enthusiastically blended together. In these few days, the League members always excitedly said, "This time it's great, we have a solution for everything we do." Under the encouragement of the League members, the masses also enthusiastically studied regulations and current affairs. They all have a common will to learn from the League members and strive to be glorious members of the Communist Youth League.

　　打破小圈子共同抗美援朝
    记北京贝满女中高三班团群关系的改善
    常愈超
    对美帝的共同仇恨，激发了同学间的真挚友情，贝满女中高中三年级同学，在这次抗美援朝保家卫国运动中，经过控诉会，认清了美帝国主义的血腥罪行后，大大改善了以往同学间不团结的现象。在控诉会上，当场就有三十一个同学提出要争取入团，愿意在青年团的领导下，更好地团结，作好抗美援朝工作和学好功课。
    在过去，高三同学中团员和群众的关系很不正常，团员们搞小圈子，认为群众落后，但又不很好去帮助她们，反而不去和她们接近，说“和她们谈话没意思”。在学习上，团员们也只顾把自己功课学好，不去帮助群众。在课外活动中，团员们也不带动群众一块来作，个别团员态度不好，引起群众不满，这样团员与群众之间隔阂很深。群众对班里的工作，从来不表示意见，团的会或学习小组会群众也很少参加。班里空气一直不活跃。甚至在一次去通州旅行时，团员所编成的队中只有一两个群众参加，群众则自己编成一队。
    抗美援朝运动高潮掀起后，贝满女中高中全体同学在本月初召开了控诉大会，会上，同学们悲愤地控诉了美帝的暴行，认清了大家面前只有一个共同的敌人，就是美帝国主义，只有一个共同的任务，就是“抗美援朝保家卫国”。任何影响执行这个任务的东西，都应该坚决抛掉；个人的一切恩怨，都应该服从这个神圣的任务。大家应该紧密团结起来向敌人进行斗争。高三同学接着又召开了分班控诉会，会上，平时崇美思想很深的刘怡春同学说：“我过去听团员们说美国是帝国主义就生气。我崇拜美国的一切，我的屋子里还挂着美国的明星照片。今天的控诉会给了我极大的启示。我认识了美帝是一只披着羊皮的狼。以前我受了它的骗，使得我和团员们都不能团结，也不能安心读书。今天，我觉悟了！”说着，痛哭起来。接着许多同学都结合着对美帝的愤恨，认清了当前共同的敌人，检讨出各人过去搞小圈子不团结是可耻的事。团员孙亦林检讨了自己和冯友同学从小就在一块念书，但是自己入团后，觉得比冯友强了，对她不但没有很好地帮助，反而一天天地和她疏远了。她诚挚地说：“冯友，请你原谅我，让我们再和从前一样地好吧！”她跑过去和冯友拥抱在一起，懊悔地哭了起来。团员高志芬说：“过去团群关系搞的不好，主要是我们的过，我们知道团员主动团结帮助其他同学的工作，作的太不够了。”曾尔慧和方珍两个团员因为一点点小事情，一年多来，彼此见了没说过话。现在她们互相谅解，亲密和好了。同学金宗禄说：“我觉得新中国的青年，都应该热爱祖国。在保卫祖国的任务面前，我们和团员没有什么分别。我们应该向她们学习，团结在团的周围，所以昨天团员们宣誓时，我也毫不犹疑地和她们一起宣誓了。”同学张国华过去想入团，但一直没提出来，在这次会上，她说：“团是革命的组织，团员都是进步的，都是爱国的。我是一个青年，应该向她们学习，我一定要争取入团。”李异珠同学并深深地检讨了自己：“我曾和同学讲过，世界上只要有一个人不入团，我就不入。我哥哥入党时，我还骂他是个大混蛋。现在我知道我错了，我简直不配作个中国青年，我太不对了。”说完话后，激动得晕倒过去。
    几十个团员和青年群众的心，在会上，溶合在一起，在团员们检讨以后，共有三十一个没有入团的同学，在会上检讨以前对团的错误认识，都要向团员看齐，学习她们的模范行为，争取入团。团员们也热烈地喊出：“欢迎新同志！”同学们把埋在心里平常不讲的话，都讲了出来。许多团员和非团员同学，都拥抱在一起，感动得哭出声来。
    经过这次控诉会后，团群关系大大地改善了。过去一向不参加任何活动的同学，这次也热心地和团员们在一起，参加了抗美援朝保家卫国工作委员会下设的各种小组，如歌咏、快板、漫画等。并且积极地出来负责。冯友和朱玉琳两个同学在研究小组会上，热心积极地学习时事，课后到新华书店去买参考书，并且最先做好了给中国人民志愿部队和朝鲜人民军的慰问袋。很多同学课后很晚才回去，搞漫画、排戏、编快板等。团员们都非常感动。两个基督徒同学诚恳地写信给高三团的宣教委员，说过去认为团员歧视她们，现在才知道这是误解。“在当前抗美援朝的巨流里，我们应该紧密的团结起来！”团员们也主动地邀请同学参加各种会议，如研究小组，学习小组，和同学一起讨论时事。自己知道的，就耐心讲给她们。此外团员并常向群众们征求意见，群众就坦白地提出意见和批评。相互之间确已打破隔阂，热烈地打成一片了。这几天团员们总兴奋地说：“这回可好了，搞什么工作全有办法了。”群众也在团员的鼓励下，热心地学习规章和时事，她们都有一个共同意志，向团员看齐，争取作个光荣的青年团员。
