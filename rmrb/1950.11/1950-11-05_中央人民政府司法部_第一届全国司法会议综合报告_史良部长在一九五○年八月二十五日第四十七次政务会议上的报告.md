The Central People's Government Ministry of Justice
Comprehensive Report of the First National Judicial Conference
Report by Minister Shi Liang at the 47th Government Affairs Council Meeting on August 25, 1950

I. Course of the Conference

To unify thinking, establish systems, exchange experiences, and resolve issues that must and can be resolved, the Ministry, together with the Supreme People's Court, the Supreme People's Procuratorate, and the Legislative Affairs Commission, jointly convened the First National Judicial Conference on July 26. To prepare for this conference, leading officials from the four organizations formed inspection teams and went to Northeast and North China to understand the situation.

The focus of the conference was to unify understanding of the principles, policies, tasks, and systems of the people's judicial work, based on Article 17 of the Common Program: "Abolish all laws, decrees, and judicial systems of the Kuomintang reactionary government that oppressed the people, formulate laws and decrees to protect the people, and establish a people's judicial system." In addition to opening remarks by President Shen Junru and closing remarks by Minister Shi Liang, there were reports by Chairman Chen Shaoyu on "Several Issues Concerning Current Judicial Work," Vice President Wu Gaizhi on "Report on the Trial Work of the People's Courts," Minister Shi Liang on "Report on Current Judicial Administration Work," and Deputy Procurator-General Li Liuru on "Tasks and Work Report of the People's Procuratorate." During the conference, speeches were also heard from Vice Chairman Liu Shaoqi, Vice Chairman Zhu De, Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier Dong Biwu, Deputy Director Peng Zhen, and introductory reports on Soviet judicial experience by two Soviet experts. In addition, some draft new regulations were submitted for discussion and comments by the participating comrades. The conference closed on August 11.

II. Main Achievements of the Conference

The main achievement of the conference was, first, to improve the cadres' understanding of the essence and function of law and the essence and function of the people's judicial work, thereby drawing a line between the old and new laws and the old and new judicial systems, that is, drawing a line between the anti-people old laws and old judicial system and the new laws and new people's judicial system that serve the people. It clarified the current tasks of the people's judicial work: mainly suppressing counter-revolutionary activities, punishing criminals who sabotage national economic construction and social order, and secondarily adjusting internal disputes among the people. In addition, it initially clarified the organizational system, scope of work, and main work to be done currently in trial work, procuratorial work, and judicial administration work.

One of the important achievements of the conference was the initial unification of cadres' understanding of several important policies. Some judicial workers and local judicial organs had a one-sided understanding of the policy of "the ringleaders of counter-revolution must be punished, those who were coerced are to be treated differently, and those who perform meritorious service are to be rewarded," failing to take all three into account, and instead embracing a "leniency above all, education as the main focus," or "leniency without end" approach. The conference made a clear criticism of this error, and everyone clarified that in dealing with counter-revolutionary activities, it is necessary to adhere to the principles stipulated in Article 7 of the Common Program. In addition, the erroneous view that criminal policy is not a "combination of punishment and education," but unilaterally emphasizes education, was criticized and corrected; and the erroneous view that the guiding principle of prison work is not a "combination of punishment and education," but unilaterally emphasizes "education and transformation" of prisoners, was criticized and corrected. After instructions from Vice Chairman Liu Shaoqi, it was clarified that the central task of the People's Court at present should be to handle cases of counter-revolution, cases of sabotage of national economic construction, and other important cases. To free up the court to complete the central tasks in trial work, the work of public security and procuratorial work should be strengthened; at the same time, violations of law and discipline should be corrected, and arbitrary arrests and detentions should be prohibited. Moreover, the organizational strength of the masses should be used as much as possible to reduce the backlog of cases in the courts. For example, some disputes among the masses do not necessarily have to be sent to the courts, and consideration can be given to resolving them through mediation by trade unions, farmers' associations, and other people's organizations, or through comrades' trial meetings.

Secondly, the mass viewpoint and mass line that should be present in the people's judicial work were affirmed. The people's judicial work must be linked to the masses and rely on the masses. In terms of systems and work style, the many good experiences of judicial work in the old liberated areas should be promoted. A trial system and litigation procedure were established that are convenient for the people and can protect the litigation rights of the people. A basic three-level, two-instance trial system and an appeal system to protect the appeal rights of the parties were proposed (except for special counter-revolutionary crimes). The open trial system, the jury system, the circuit trial and on-the-spot trial system, the publicity and education system, and the mediation system, which can both promote judicial democracy and educate the people, were summarized. It was clarified that the People's Procuratorate should establish necessary working relationships with the people's government organs, public officials, and the broad masses, so as to realize the important tasks of supervising law-abiding behavior and reporting violations of the law. This is a necessary measure for implementing the mass line in the judicial system. However, at the same time, another deviation must be corrected, that is, engaging in judicial work simply by engaging in mass work. Deputy Director Peng Zhen pointed out in his report that on judicial issues, the mass line and legal coercion are consistent. The compulsory judgment and compulsory execution implemented on individuals, representing the will of the state and the interests of the majority, are precisely the manifestation of the mass viewpoint in judicial work. Without compulsory judgment and compulsory execution, the will and interests of the majority of the people would be violated, and there would truly be no mass viewpoint.

Finally, the conference improved the understanding of the importance of judicial work. The reports emphasized that the people's judicial work is one of the sharpest weapons of the people's democratic dictatorship and an important component of the state apparatus. Strengthening this sharp weapon to suppress the enemy and protect the people is the arduous and glorious task of judicial workers. Judicial workers must have a correct understanding of the importance of the people's judicial work and overcome the phenomenon that some cadres are not at ease in judicial work.

These are all important achievements of the conference, especially in unifying legal viewpoints and laying the ideological foundation for the establishment of a people's judicial system, which is the central achievement of the conference.

III. Several Specific Issues at Present

1. People's governments at all levels should strengthen their leadership over judicial work. According to reports from comrades from various regions attending the conference, although the leadership of the major administrative regions is very concerned about and encourages judicial work, some lower-level government organs still do not pay enough attention to judicial work. Some local leading organs rarely or never discuss or inspect judicial work, and the allocation of judicial cadres is insufficient, or difficulties are not resolved in a timely manner, so that the construction of judicial work lags far behind objective needs. For this reason, it is hoped that people's governments at all levels will give more assistance to their subordinate judicial departments, regularly discuss and inspect judicial work, and help them appropriately resolve the existing difficulties.

2. All regions must transfer a certain number and quality of veteran cadres to serve as the backbone of judicial work. Major administrative regions or provinces can run judicial training classes to train new cadres, transform old judicial personnel, and improve incumbent cadres to meet the current urgent needs of the work. At the same time, in order to professionalize judicial cadres, people's governments at all levels should not easily transfer them without the consent of the higher-level judicial organs.

3. Judicial operating expenses should be collected and disbursed in a unified manner.

4. Under the premise of not affecting the national establishment plan, based on the uneven development of work in various regions and the fact that judicial organs are more familiar with their own business conditions, the provincial or major administrative region judicial organs may, with the consent of the local people's government and the establishment committee, make necessary adjustments within the scope of their jurisdiction. If there are still difficulties, people's governments at all levels should weigh the situation in their respective regions and make appropriate adjustments and considerations within the total reserved quota.

5. If court and prison facilities are occupied by other departments, they should be returned to the court as much as possible, or the court should be helped to arrange a suitable location elsewhere.

6. At present, university legal education faces some difficulties due to the lack of teachers and teaching materials. How to address this situation in the future so that the legal education run by the state can be combined with practical needs and adapt to and help promote judicial work is also an issue that should be paid attention to.

Finally, we also had some shortcomings in this conference, such as the preparatory work before the conference and the reports presented were not sufficiently prepared, the organization of the conference was not organized enough, the content of the conference was heavy, the time was short, and the discussions were insufficient. These shortcomings should be reviewed and corrected in the future.

　　中央人民政府司法部
    第一届全国司法会议综合报告
    史良部长在一九五○年八月二十五日第四十七次政务会议上的报告
    一、会议的经过
    为统一思想、建立制度、交流经验及解决必须与可能解决的问题，由本部与最高人民法院、最高人民检察署及法制委员会四机关于七月二十六日联合召开了第一届全国司法会议。为着准备这会议，会前曾由四机关首长组织视察组分赴东北与华北了解情况。
    会议中心是根据共同纲领第十七条——“废除国民党反动政府一切压迫人民的法律、法令和司法制度，制定保护人民的法律、法令，建立人民司法制度。”之规定，统一对人民司法工作方针、政策、任务与制度的认识。会议除沈钧儒院长致开会词，史良部长致闭会词外，有陈绍禹主任委员“关于目前司法工作的几个问题”的报告，吴溉之副院长“人民法院审判工作报告”，史良部长“关于目前司法行政工作报告”及李六如副检察长“人民检查任务及工作报告”。在会议中并听了刘副主席、朱副主席、周总理、董副总理、彭真副主任的讲话及两位苏联专家关于苏联司法经验的介绍报告。此外，还有一些新法规草案，提经与会同志讨论并提供意见。会议于八月十一日闭幕。
    二、会议的主要收获
    会议主要收获首先是提高了干部对法律的本质与功能和人民司法工作的本质与功能的认识，因而划清了新旧法律与新旧司法制度的界限，即划清了反人民的旧法律和旧司法制度与为人民服务的新法律和新人民司法制度之间的界限。明确了人民司法工作当前的任务：主要是镇压反革命活动，制裁破坏国家经济建设和社会秩序罪犯，其次是调整人民内部纠纷。此外，还初步地明确了审判工作、检察工作及司法行政工作的组织制度、工作范围及当前应作的主要工作。
    会议的重要收获之一，是初步地统一了干部们对若干重要政策的认识。某些司法工作人员和地方司法机关对反革命“首恶必办，胁从不同，立功受奖”的三者不可偏废的政策，曾经发生了“宽大为怀，教育为主”的也即是“宽大无止”的片面认识，会议对此种错误作了明晰的批判，因而大家明确了在对待反革命活动时，必须坚持贯彻共同纲领第七条所规定的方针。此外又批判和纠正了刑事政策不是“惩罚与教育相结合”，而是片面强调教育的错误观点；批判和纠正了监狱工作方针不是“惩罚与教育相结合”，而是片面强调对犯人“教育改造”的错误观点。经过刘副主席的指示，又明确了人民法院当前的中心任务应该是处理反革命案、破坏国家经济建设案及其他重要案件，为了法院腾出力量完成审判工作中的中心任务，应加强公安工作及检察工作；同时，纠正违法乱纪，禁止乱捕乱押；并应尽量运用群众的组织力量，减少法院积案，如对于有些群众中的纠纷，就不一定都要送到法院，可考虑由工会、农会及其他人民团体组织调解或同志审判会等方式来解决。
    其次，肯定了人民司法工作中应有的群众观点与群众路线，人民司法工作必须联系群众、依靠群众，在制度上与作风上，应发扬老解放区司法工作许多好的经验。确定了便利人民而又能保护人民诉讼权利的审判制度和诉讼程序。提出了基本上三级两审的审级制度和保护当事人上诉权利的上诉制度（但特种反革命犯罪除外）。总结了既能发扬审判民主又能教育人民的公开审理制度、陪审制度、巡回审判与就地审判制度、宣教制度、调解制度。明确了人民检察机关应与人民政府机关、公职人员和广大群众建立必要的工作上的联系，以便实现监督守法和检举违法的重大任务。这是贯彻群众路线在司法制度上的应有措施。但同时必须纠正另一个偏向，即以单纯搞群众工作的方式来搞司法工作，彭真副主任报告中指出在司法问题上，群众路线与法律强制是一致的，代表国家的意旨、代表多数人的利益而对个别人所实行的强制裁判和强制执行，正是群众观点在司法工作上的表现，如果没有强制裁判和强制执行，才是违反大多数人民意志与利益；才真是没有群众观点。
    最后，会议提高了对司法工作重要性的认识，报告中均着重说明了人民司法工作是人民民主专政中最锐利的武器之一，是国家机器中的一个重要组成部分。加强这一镇压敌人、保护人民的锐利武器，是司法工作者艰巨而光荣的任务。必须使司法工作人员对人民司法工作的重要性有正确的认识，并克服一部分干部不安心司法工作的现象。
    这都是会议的重要收获，特别是统一法律观点，奠定建立人民司法制度的思想基础方面，是会议的中心收获。
    三、目前几个具体问题
    １、各级人民政府应加强对司法工作的领导。据与会各地同志反映，各大行政区领导上对司法工作虽是很关怀并给予鼓励，但有些下级政府机关对司法工作仍有重视不够的现象，有些地方领导机关对司法工作很少甚至没有讨论与检查，对司法干部调配不够，或对困难未能及时解决，以致司法工作建设远落在客观需要之后。为此，希望各级人民政府对所属司法部门，给以更多的帮助，定期讨论与检查司法工作，并帮助他们适当地解决所存在的困难。
    ２、各地须调配一定数量与质量的老干部，给司法工作作骨干，各大行政区或省可举办司法训练班，借以训练新干部，改造旧司法人员和提高在职干部，以应目前工作急需。同时，为使司法干部专业化，各级人民政府不经上级司法机关同意，不宜轻易调动。
    ３、司法业务费，应统收统支。
    ４、司法编制在不影响国家编制计划下，依据各地工作发展不平衡及司法机关较熟悉自己的业务情况，可由省或大行政区司法机关商得当地人民政府和编制委员会的同意，在自己所辖的编制范围内作必要的调剂。如果仍有困难，应请各级人民政府，权衡该区情况，在总预备名额内，酌予调剂照顾。
    ５、法院与监房设备，如有为其他部门占用，应尽可能拨归法院之用，或帮助法院另安排适当地址。
    ６、目前大学法律教育由于师资与教材的缺乏，存在着若干困难，今后应如何针对这个情形，使国家办的大学法律教育能结合实际需要，适应和有助于司法工作的推进，这也是应当注意的一个问题。
    最后，我们在这次会议中还有一些缺点，如会前准备工作和提出的报告都还准备不够充分，会议进行的组织性还不够，会议内容分量重，时间短促、讨论不充分等缺点，应该检讨并在今后改正。
