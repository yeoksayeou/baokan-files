I. An Outline of America

In the past, under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, and under the deceptive propaganda of American imperialism and its running dogs, the hideous face of American imperialism was often painted very beautifully. American imperialism's methods are more sophisticated than those of old-fashioned imperialism, using many beautiful terms and singing so-called "democracy" and "freedom" to cover up its ugly face. In theory, in a country with highly developed industrial technology, if it were really as good as the reactionary propaganda boasted, the vast majority of American people should be enjoying a very affluent life, free from want, and without worrying about illness or unemployment. But what is the actual situation?

According to a 1945 survey by the U.S. Federal Reserve Board, out of 46 million households in the United States: 9.3 million, accounting for 20 percent of the total population, had weekly incomes below $19; 12.4 million, accounting for 27 percent of the total population, had weekly incomes between $19 and $38.5; and 10.3 million, accounting for 22.4 percent of the total population, had weekly incomes between $38.5 and $57.5. In total, 70 percent of the population had weekly incomes below $57.5 per household. However, at that time, a household needed a monthly income of $200 to maintain a decent standard of living. Seventy percent of the population, at best, could only maintain a decent standard of living, and most were below that standard. That was the situation in 1945. At that time, it was still near the end of the war, and workers had overtime pay, resulting in higher incomes. In the years after the war, overtime pay was eliminated, prices rose, and general wages, calculated in terms of actual purchasing power, were 17 percent lower in 1949 than in early 1945. At the same time, the unemployed population continued to increase. By June of this year, it was estimated that 80 percent of families could only maintain a standard of living below the decent level.

Did these families have any savings? According to the same survey, among the first category of households with weekly incomes below $19, available savings were only $20; the second category with weekly incomes between $19 and $38.5, had average available savings of $230 per household; and the third category with weekly incomes between $38.5 and $57.5, had average savings of $470 per household. Such small amounts of savings could not guarantee the safety of a family. Once there was illness or other accidents, they simply could not cope. According to the Federal Reserve Board's 1949 statistics, the small amount of savings held by most people was also disappearing. Some not only used up all their savings but were also living on borrowed money.

So where did the wealth of the United States, which claims to be the world's largest financial power, go? Undoubtedly, it went into the bottomless pockets of the monopoly capitalists. From 1936 to 1939, the average annual profit of capitalists was 53 billion yuan. Post-war profits continued to increase. By 1948, the profits of capitalists amounted to 340 billion yuan in one year.

This wealth was created by the labor of 45 million workers in the United States, but it was concentrated in the hands of a few capitalists. The Morgan family, the Rockefeller family, the Mellon family, and the DuPont family alone controlled two-thirds of the entire industrial property of the United States. These large capitalists exploited workers in various ways. In 1939, the profit squeezed from each manufacturing worker was only 470 yuan, but by 1948, they were able to squeeze 1,481 yuan from each worker, an increase of more than threefold in the intensity of exploitation. Thus, the poor were desperately poor, and the rich were truly rich to the point of death. The days of these bloodsuckers of the working people are not far away.

But, before these monopoly capitalists, big financial tycoons, and big merchants are wiped out, they will use their abundant financial resources to control the entire United States, exploit the American working people, and even try to control the whole world and enslave the working people of the whole world.

Let's see how they control the entire United States. In the 81st Congress's Senate, 66 of the 96 senators were lawyers, 16 were big businessmen, and 9 were big landlords. These agents of the big capitalists occupied 91 seats, accounting for 95 percent of all senators. In the House of Representatives, out of 435 representatives, lawyers, businessmen, and bankers alone occupied 316 seats, accounting for 75 percent. Everyone knows that Congress is a major link in American politics. The big capitalists control Congress, which is equivalent to controlling American politics. Moreover, in other parts of politics, the president and officials in other important departments are almost all figures selected and cultivated by the big capitalists, and some are themselves big capitalists. In this way, they control the entire American political apparatus.

On the other hand, the claws of American monopoly capitalists have also reached all parts of the world. During World War II, American imperialism built 484 naval and air force bases in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, 228 in the Atlantic and 256 in various parts of the Pacific. Their armed claws are spread all over the world, attempting to use these bases to attack the peace camp headed by the Soviet Union, and attempting to eliminate all peace-loving and genuinely democratic and free countries.

From the introduction to this outline above, we can clearly see what kind of country the United States is. The so-called democracy in the United States is actually the democracy of a small handful of monopoly capitalists. The so-called freedom in American imperialism is the freedom of capitalists to exploit the working people and the freedom of imperialists to enslave the people of the world.

II. American Social Life

American capitalism is rotting more and more deeply, and this rotting capitalism is reflected in all aspects of social life:

(1) Life of Mammonism: In the United States, the most typical capitalist country, there is no other measure of value except money. For money, everything can be sold. Respect for the president is far less than respect for a millionaire; praising a smart and talented person, they don't say he is "smart" or "capable," but say he is "worth a million dollars." Just for the sake of money, they compete with each other, engage in intrigue; there is no emotion between people, no collective concept, and therefore a lack of truly meaningful happiness. Whether young or old, every Saturday night, they drink wildly in bars, making a lot of noise; when they are drunk, they quarrel and make trouble. Apart from bars and cinemas, it seems that they have nowhere to go. Drinking, listening to vulgar music, is nothing more than to relieve the inner loneliness. Every major holiday, like the Fourth of July Independence Day, hundreds of people die in car accidents across the United States. In the newspapers, they even make statistics and predictions about these accidents, and the predicted numbers are said to be not much different from the actual number of deaths. They live such a corrupt life of treating human life as a plaything, almost crazy.

(2) Corrupt and decadent politics: The entire ruling apparatus in the United States is a tool used by the bourgeoisie to oppress the vast people, such as the proletariat and petty bourgeoisie. The president is a puppet of the capitalists, and elections are bribery and also gambling. Like the election in November 1948, when Truman won, those who sent him money and supported his election became high officials. Johnson became the Secretary of Defense in that way. Johnson himself had a close relationship with an aircraft manufacturing factory, and after taking office, he ordered a large number of aircraft from that factory. Truman had to play poker every weekend, and his gambling friends were also his personal military attachés. When big corruption was exposed, Truman shielded them. Truman's personal physician was also a well-known master of corruption. Before Truman gave a public speech, he had to get the consent of Wall Street first; therefore, his speech was always revised again and again.

The members of Congress almost all represent the big capitalists and local ruffians in their respective constituencies. Members of Congress can be bought with money or other material conditions to speak for a particular interest. Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang spent a lot of money in the U.S. Congress, buying some members of Congress to ask for money and speak for Chiang's bandits. Sometimes, when conditions are set to pass a bill to aid Chiang, a few percent of it is distributed to members of Congress who support the bill.

Locally, the black forces are rampant, and most political figures often collude with these forces. In New York, large and small casinos have to pay tribute to the police, and the most they have to pay is 500 yuan. In San Francisco, a company operating a private prostitution business is located next door to the police station. In Truman's hometown of Missouri, when a gang leader was shot to death, more than half of the high officials in Washington rushed to attend the funeral.

The big capitalists of Wall Street and the local gang leaders are thus closely integrated, forming a reactionary force that controls the entire political system. The president, members of Congress, ministers, and mayors are all spokespersons for this reactionary force.

(3) Social unrest: In a society controlled by this reactionary force, it is impossible to be stable. Peach-colored scandals, robberies, homicides, mental patients, and juvenile offenders are constantly increasing, which fully demonstrates the social unrest. According to the 1948 statistics, more than half of all hospitalized patients, about 600,000, suffer from mental illness, and 150,000 new mental patients are added every year. Every year, there are 250,000 to 400,000 children entering juvenile court, and various crimes occur on average every 18.7 seconds, with an average of 36 homicides every day. Rape cases increased by 50 percent in 1948 compared to ten years ago. In 1948 alone, 759,698 people were arrested for crimes, and the most common age of offenders was 21 years old.

The most dangerous thing is that these mental patients are not entirely patients in hospitals, and some even control the policies of the United States. Former Secretary of Defense Forrestal is an example. He himself was a big capitalist and a vanguard against the Soviet Union and communism. Seeing the growing strength of the world's peace forces, he became mentally deranged out of fear. When he was the Secretary of Defense, he was also suffering from a serious mental illness. He suspected that every guest who came to see him was a communist; at night, when he heard the sound of a fire truck, he thought that the Red Army had arrived in Washington, and he ran into the street in his pajamas, shouting "The Red Army is here! The Red Army is here!" Finally, he jumped off the building of the naval hospital and committed suicide.

This typical example, on the one hand, reflects the unrest of the entire American society, and on the other hand, specifically illustrates that even as an important war criminal, he has great fear of the great power of the people of the world, and at the same time, it provides a vivid example for other reactionary vanguards, whose way out is inevitably suicide and extinction.

(4) Cultural degeneration: Political corruption and decadence, social unrest, the mania for money, and the consciousness of individualism are reflected in the cultural aspect, which forms cultural degeneration; and the degenerated culture further influences ideological consciousness and further promotes social unrest.

All the tools for spreading culture - newspapers, magazines, movies, radio, radio facsimile, etc. - almost none of them are not under the control of capitalists. The big capitalists use these tools to carry out reactionary propaganda to the people and to paralyze the people. Apart from advertising, there are only two main categories of content: one is anti-Soviet and anti-communist propaganda, and the other is pornography and stimulation. The vast majority of the headlines are about murder, rape, robbery, and "cracking down on communist spies," etc. Almost all magazine covers are uniformly a photo of a woman's half-naked body. This kind of American "civilization" has the worst impact on children. Children imitate the "heroes" in detective and martial arts movies, learning to use guns with both hands like big robbers, and learning various techniques of murder and robbery. It is said that once a major homicide occurred, and the police spent a lot of effort to solve the case. The main culprit was a young man under the age of twenty. He confessed that he was completely attracted to a detective story, and he just tried to do it according to the story. The influence of pornographic books, movies, etc., caused dozens of men and dozens of women to have collective orgies in the suburbs. The "civilization" of the United States is these endless facts.

Another very effective tool for capitalists to paralyze the people is religion. Religion gives those who are spiritually very empty and depressed, money-grubbing and individualists a sustenance, and gives criminals a chance to repent: he does many bad things six days a week, kneels in the church on the seventh day, and can do bad things again on the eighth day. Truman, after launching the Korean War, pretended to be very serious and prayed in the church. These war criminals wiped the blood of their murders in front of the altar. Capitalists use religion to promote anti-Soviet and anti-communist ideas, and also use religion to paralyze the resistance consciousness of the oppressed people. A pastor said to a black man who had been beaten by a white man: "You should learn the spirit of Christ. If someone hits you on the left cheek, you should send your right cheek up."

Even science, which was originally used to improve human life, is now being used in the United States as a tool to destroy civilization and massacre people. Most of the scientific research is controlled by the Navy, Army, and Air Force of the Department of Defense and the Atomic Energy Commission. Especially the Atomic Energy Commission, which has the largest plans and the most sufficient funding for the production of atomic bombs. Because these studies are related to "military secrets," people who do research work in these government departments or universities that cooperate with the government must be considered "reliable" in their thinking by the special service agencies. Those who do research in factories must also keep the secret of pursuing profits for the capitalists. Therefore, scientific workers have basically lost the freedom to research and discuss. A famous chemist, Linus Pauling, was immediately warned by the State Department for publicly opposing the manufacture of atomic bombs; thousands of copies of a "Scientific American" magazine were burned for publishing an article discussing atomic energy by the famous physicist Haus Bethe; a university professor was expelled by the school for supporting Lysenko's genetic theory; a large number of professors and lecturers at the University of California were also expelled for not signing the loyalty oath. Under this reactionary fascist rule, science cannot develop. Science, like trees, must grow in a suitable and warm environment. The many achievements of the Soviet Union in agricultural science and physiological science are no longer within the reach of American capitalist science.

(5) Racial Discrimination: The oppression of black people is inhumane. There are a total of fifteen million black people in the United States, accounting for one-tenth of the total population. Their main distribution area is in the South, in what is called the Black Belt, the most densely populated area of black people. The American South is an agricultural capitalist society, and the main crop is cotton. In order to lower costs and compete with other cotton-producing countries, black labor is exploited beyond economic means. Most black people do not have land. White people exploit black people, which is similar to the situation of Chinese landlords exploiting farmers. The experiences of some black people are not even imaginable to Chinese farmers. In the South, black people must walk behind white people. When taking public transportation, there is a black line in the car, with white people in the front and black people's seats in the back. Once, a black man from the North went to the South, and because he was sitting in a white person's seat in the car, someone warned him, but he ignored it. At the second stop, someone hit him on the head and killed him. Black people are not allowed to enter white people's restaurants and hotels, and blacks and whites cannot marry. In this way, two worlds are divided by the color of their skin. The Ku Klux Klan, a fascist terrorist organization of white supremacists. They lynch, torture, shoot, or hang black people who do not obey their rule. In the northern United States, although it is formally more enlightened, walking, taking public transportation, and entering restaurants do not have significant segregation, black people are still exploited and oppressed. In factories, wages are lower than those of white people, and they pay higher rents for renting white people's houses; they are not easy to find good jobs and mostly do hard labor and night work. A black classmate said, "America is not our motherland." National thought is rising among black people, and hatred will inevitably turn into strength. There are outstanding black leaders in the Communist Party, and black people will be liberated sooner or later.

In addition to black people, other people like Jews, Mexicans, and Puerto Ricans are also discriminated against, exploited, and oppressed. Like the famous Professor Einstein, because he is Jewish and opposes the manufacture of atomic bombs, some people in Congress clamored: "Drive that Jew back to Europe!" Our overseas Chinese in the United States are also deeply oppressed. In New York, several cases of overseas Chinese being robbed and beaten occur frequently in January. Overseas Chinese went abroad because they could not make a living under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang in the past. When it comes to imperialism, everyone hates it. The birth of New China has given overseas Chinese a real motherland.

(6) Persecution of progressive forces: In order to consolidate their rule over the vast people, monopoly capitalists must suppress progressive forces, crack down on progressive forces, and persecute progressive elements. In recent years, we can see speeches and actions oppressing progressive forces in the newspapers almost every day. They use the most despicable means to eavesdrop on private telephones, send secret agents, hire thugs, and even establish companies specializing in sabotaging strikes. Hitler's ability to kill and beat people is used by the American ruling class more highly and more flexibly.

Let's take a most typical example. Last autumn, when the famous black singer Robeson held a concert, he was obstructed by illegal violence. On August 27, the day the concert was originally scheduled to take place, the reactionary fascist forces first gathered 300 thugs from the "Anti-Communist Crusade" to block the entrance of the venue, and beat the staff of the venue. As a result, the concert aborted. But when the news spread, it immediately aroused the resentment of the masses. On September 4, the concert was held again, attended by 25,000 audiences, with 2,500 people volunteering to serve as pickets, holding hands and forming a defense line around the venue. Thus, the concert was held smoothly. But would the reactionaries be willing to give up? Hundreds of thugs scattered on both sides of the highway at the exit of the venue, throwing stones at the audience who took the bus back, overturning the cars and breaking the windows. At the same time, the government sent hundreds of armed police to surround the pickets who were protecting the venue, seriously injuring some people, searching all the peaceful pickets, and finally arresting a few of the beaten and injured people and interrogating them in court, accusing them of being "thugs."

These fascist rulers regard peaceful people as thugs; they also use the same method to deal with people who support the peace movement, publishing the names of people who sign in support of peace in the newspaper as a threat; using thugs to disrupt peace movement gatherings, and throwing people who preside over peace movement signatures into prison. They vainly attempt to use violence to stop people's love for peace. However, the peace movement has still unfolded. In New York alone, more than 500,000 people risked threats and violence to sign their names on the peace declaration. Although the eleven leaders of the Communist Party have been illegally tried and detained, the progressive forces, led by the American Communist Party, are rising day by day. Soon, it will stand up firmly and unite with all peace-loving, democratic, and progressive people in the world to form a huge and unparalleled force to smash the ferocious American imperialism and eliminate the rotten American capitalism from the ground.

　　看，这就是美国！  丁儆 
    编者按：本文作者是留美科学工作者，不久前返国，现在华大工学院任教授。
    一、美国轮廓
    过去在国民党的反动统治下，在美帝和美帝走狗们的欺骗宣传之下，美帝的狰狞面目，往往被粉刷得十分美丽。美帝的手法比一般老式帝国主义来得高明，会用许多漂亮的名词，高唱所谓“民主”“自由”来掩盖它丑恶的面目。照理讲，在一个工业技术高度发达的国家，假如真像反动宣传所鼓吹得那么好，美国的广大人民应该都享受着很富足的生活，不虞匮乏，不必忧虑疾病或失业，但是实际情形怎样呢？
    根据美国联邦储备局一九四五年的调查，在全美四千六百万户人家中：有九百三十万家，占总人口百分之二十，每周的收入低于十九元；有一千二百四十万家，占总人口的百分之二十七，每周的收入在十九元到三十八点五元之间；有一千零三十万家，占总人口的百分之二十二点四，每周收入在三十八点五元到五十七点五元之间。总起来看，有百分之七十的人口，每家每周收入在五十七点五元以下。然而在那时候，每家每月必须有二百元的收入，才能维持水准的生活，有百分之七十的人口，最好亦不过维持水准的生活，而大多数在水准以下，那是一九四五年的情形。那时还在大战末期，工人都有加班工资，收入较丰，到战后几年，加班工资取消，物价增涨，一般工资，按实际购买力计算，在一九四九年较一九四五年初降低了百分之十七。同时，失业人口不断增加，到今年六月间，估计有百分之八十的家庭，收入只能维持水准以下的生活。
    这些人家有没有储蓄呢？根据同一调查，在上面第一类收入每周在十九元以下的人家中，可用的储蓄才不过二十元；第二类每周收入在十九元到三十八点五元之间的，每家可用储蓄平均二百三十元；第三类每周收入在三十八点五到五十七点五元之间的，每家可储蓄平均四百七十元。这样少数目的储蓄，是决不能保障一家人家的安全的，一旦有疾病，或其他意外，就根本无法应付。而根据联邦储备局一九四九年的统计，大部分人民极少数量的储蓄，亦正在消失的过程中，有的不单用尽了所有的储蓄，而且已经借债度日。
    那么号称世界第一大财主的美国，财富究竟到那里去了呢？毫无疑问的，到了独占资本家的装不满的钱袋里去了。在一九三六到一九三九年内，资本家的每年平均利润为五十三万万元，战后的利润，还是不断增高，到一九四八年，资本家的利润一年内就有三百四十万万元。
    这些财富，是由美国四千五百万工人的劳动所创造的，但却集中在少数资本家手里，光是摩根家族、洛克菲勒家族、梅隆家族、杜邦家族等四大家族，就控制了全美工业财产的三分之二。这些大资本家，用种种方法剥削工人。在一九三九年，在每个制造业工人身上榨取的利润才不过四百七十元，到一九四八年，竟能在每个工人身上榨出一千四百八十一元的利润，剥削强度增加了三倍多。这样，穷的固然穷得要命，富的也真的富得要死。这些劳动人民的吸血虫，离他们死亡的日子已经没有多远了。
    但是，就在这些独占资本家，大财阀大商人一天没有灭亡之前，他们就利用他们优厚的财力，来控制整个美国，剥削美国的劳动人民，还妄想控制整个世界，奴役全世界的劳动人民。
    且看他们怎样控制整个美国吧。在八十一届国会的参议院，九十六个参议员中有六十六个律师，十六个大商人，九个大地主。这些大资本家的经纪人，就占据了九十一席，占全部参议员百分之九十五。而在众议院的四百三十五个议员中，光是律师商人和银行家，就占据了三百十六人，占百分之七十五。大家都知道，国会是美国政治主要的一环，大资本家控制了国会，亦就等于控制了美国政治，何况政治其它部分，总统和其他重要部门的官员，几乎清一色地都是由大资本家挑选培养出来的人物，有些自己就是大资本家。就是这样，它们控制了美国整个政治机构。
    另一方面，美独占资本家的魔手又伸向世界各地，在第二次世界大战期间，美帝在太平洋和大西洋所建筑的海空军基地就有四百八十四处，其中二百二十八处在大西洋，二百五十六处在太平洋各地，它们的武装爪牙散布在世界各地，妄想利用这些根据地向以苏联为首的和平阵营进攻，妄想消灭所有爱好和平的真正民主自由的国家。
    从上面这个轮廓的介绍中，我们已经能够清楚地看出，美国究竟是怎样一个国家。美国的所谓民主，实际上是一小撮独占资本家的民主；美帝的所谓自由，是资本家剥削劳动人民的自由，帝国主义奴役世界人民的自由。
    二、美国社会生活
    美国资本主义正在日益加深的溃烂着，这溃烂的资本主义，反映到社会生活的各个方面：
    （一）拜金主义的生活：在美国这样一个最典型的资本主义国家，除了钱，就没有任何其他衡量价值的尺度，为了钱，可以出卖一切。对于总统的尊敬，远不如对于一个百万富翁的尊敬；称赞一个聪明有才能的人，不说他“聪明”或“能干”，而说他“值一百万块钱”。就为着钱，彼此竞争，勾心斗角；人与人间没有感情，没有集体观念，亦就缺少真正有意义的快乐。无论青年或老年人，每到星期六夜间，就在酒吧间里狂饮，乱喝乱跳；喝醉了酒，乱吵乱闹。他们除了酒吧间和电影院外，好像就没有什么地方可去。喝酒，听下流的音乐，无非为了解救内心的寂寞。每逢大节日的假期，像七月四日的独立纪念日，总有几百人在全美各地因汽车失事而死亡，而在报纸上，居然还对这种失事作统计和预测，预测的数字据说和实际发生的死亡数目差不了多少。他们就是这样过着把人命当儿戏，近乎疯狂的腐烂生活。
    （二）贪污腐败的政治：整个统治机构，在美国就是资产阶级用来压迫无产阶级和小资产阶级等广大人民的工具，总统是资本家的傀儡，竞选是贿赂，也是赌博。像一九四八年十一月的竞选，杜鲁门得胜了，那些送他钱，支持他竞选的人，就做大官。詹森担任国防部长，就是那么一会事。詹森本人和一飞机制造厂家有密切关系，上任后，就向那厂订购了大批飞机。杜鲁门每个周末一定要赌扑克，他的赌友也是他的私人武官。大贪污被人揭发了，杜鲁门包庇下来。这就是他的私人医生，也是出名的贪污能手。杜鲁门在公开讲演之前，一定要先得到华尔街的同意；因此他的讲演稿总是一再修改的。
    国会的议员们，几乎都代表着各选区内的大资本家和地痞流氓这两种人物。议员都可以用金钱或其他物质条件来收买，要他们为某一特殊利益讲话。蒋介石匪帮就在美国国会花了大批金元，收买一些议员帮蒋匪要钱说话。有时候，订立条件，由国会通过一笔援蒋款项时，就将其中百分之几，分给支持这个法案的议员。
    在地方上，黑势力横行，大多政治人物和这些势力往往勾结起来。在纽约、大小赌馆要孝敬警察，最多的要花五百元。在旧金山，经营私娼买卖的公司就设在警察局的隔壁。在杜鲁门故乡密苏里州，一位流氓头子被人枪杀了，华盛顿的大官们，有一半以上赶去送葬。
    华尔街的大资本家和地方上的流氓头子，就这样密切相结合，形成一个反动势力，控制了整个政治。总统、议员、部长、市长先生们，都不过是这反动势力的代言人。
    （三）社会的不安：在这种反动势力控制下的社会，是不可能安定的。桃色纠纷、抢劫、凶杀、精神病患者和儿童犯法者，不断增加，充分说明了这社会的不安。根据一九四八年的统计，所有住院病人的一半以上，大约有六十万，患有精神病，而每年又要增加十五万个新的精神病人。每年总有二十五万到四十万个儿童进入儿童法庭，各种罪案，平均每十八点七秒钟发生一件，每天平均三十六件凶杀案，强奸案在一九四八年比十年前增加了百分之五十。在一九四八年一年之中，就有七十五万九千六百九十八人因犯罪而被拘捕，而犯罪者最多数的年龄是二十一岁。
    最危险的是：这些精神病患者不完全是医院里的病人，有些甚至掌握着美国国家的政策，前国防部长福勒斯特就是一个例子。他自己就是大资本家，又是反苏反共的先锋，眼见世界和平力量日益强大，由恐惧而精神失常。当他做着国防部长的时候，亦正患着严重的精神病。他见一个客人就怀疑来人是共产党；夜里听到救火车的声音，就以为红军已经到了华盛顿，穿着睡衣，跑到街上，大喊“红军来了！红军来了！”最后终于从海军医院的大楼上跳楼自杀了。
    这个典型的例子，一方面反映了美国整个社会的不安，另一方面具体说明了即使身为重要战争贩子，对于世界人民的伟大力量有极大的恐惧，同时亦为其他反动先锋们做了一个生动的榜样，他们的出路必然是自杀和灭亡。
    （四）文化的堕落：政治的贪污腐败，社会的不安，拜金狂和个人主义的生活意识，反映在文化方面，就形成了文化的堕落；而堕落的文化又进一步影响了思想意识，进一步推进了社会的不安。
    所有传播文化的工具——报纸、杂志、电影、无线电、无线电传真等等，几乎没有一样不在资本家控制之下，大资本家就利用这些工具，向人民作反动宣传和麻痹人民。除了广告以外，只有两类主要的内容：一类是反苏反共的宣传，另一类就是色情和刺激。绝大多数的头条新闻是杀人、强奸、盗劫和“破获共党间谍”之类，所有杂志的封面，几乎千篇一律的是一张女人半裸体的照片。这种美国的“文明”对于儿童有最坏的影响，孩子们都模仿侦探武侠电影里的“英雄”们，学习双手打枪的大强盗，学习种种杀人抢劫的技巧。据说有一次发生一件大凶杀案，警察费了很大的力量，才把这案子破了，主犯是一个不上二十岁的青年，他供说：他完全为一个侦探故事所吸引了，他不过照着那故事试做一遍。色情书籍、电影等的影响，使几十个男的和几十个女的，到郊外集体野合。美国的“文明”，就是这些讲不尽的事实。
    资本家另一非常有效的麻痹人民的工具，就是宗教。宗教给那些精神上非常空虚苦闷的拜金狂和个人主义者一个寄托，使犯罪的人有一个忏悔的机会：他一星期六天做了许多坏事，第七天到教堂里跪一下，第八天又可以做坏事了。杜鲁门在发动朝鲜战争以后，就曾装着很严肃的面孔，到教堂里祈祷。这些战争贩子就在圣坛面前揩拭自己杀人的血渍。资本家利用宗教，宣传反苏反共的思想，亦用宗教来麻痹被压迫人民的反抗意识。一个牧师向一个挨了白人打的黑人说道：“你应该学习基督的精神，人家打你左颊，你应该把右颊送上去。”
    就是本来用作改进人类生活的科学，如今在美国亦被用为摧毁文明、屠杀人民的工具。大部分科学研究，都由国防部的海陆空三军和原子能委员会控制着。尤其是原子能委员会，为了制造原子弹，计划最为庞大，经费最为充足。因为这些研究都有关“军事秘密”，在这些政府部门或与政府合作的大学里做研究工作的人，必须经特务机关认为思想“可靠”才行。在工厂做研究的，亦必须为资本家保守追求利润的秘密。所以科学工作者已在基本上失去了研究、讨论的自由，一个有名的化学家保林（Linus Pouliug）因为公开声明反对制造原子弹，立即受到国务院的警告；一本“科学美国”杂志，因为刊载名物理学家贝特（Haus Betle）的一篇讨论原子能的文章，烧毁数千本；一位大学教授因为赞成李森科的遗传学说遭校方开除；加州大学的大批教授讲师，因为不签忠诚誓言，亦遭开除。在这种反动的法西斯统治下，科学是不可能发达起来的，科学和树木一样，一定要在适宜的温暖的环境中才能生长。苏联在农业科学和生理科学上的许多成就，已经不是美国资本主义的科学所能及了。
    （五）种族歧视：对黑人的压迫是惨无人道的。全美国一共有一千五百万黑人，占总人口十分之一，他们主要的分布地区在南方，有所谓黑带（BlackBelt），是黑人最密集的几州。美国南部是农业资本社会，主要的农作物是棉花。为了压低成本和其他产棉国家相竞争，黑人的劳动力就被超经济地剥削着。黑人大都没有土地，白人剥削黑人，就和中国地主剥削农民的情形差不多，有些黑人的遭遇，还不是中国农民所能想象的。在南方，黑人走路必须走在白人后面，坐公共汽车，车里有一条黑线，前面白人，后面才是黑人的座位。有一次，有一位黑人从北方到南方，因为坐在车里白人坐的地方，有人警告他，他不顾，到第二站就有人对他当头一棒，打死了。黑人不能进白人的饭店、旅馆，黑白不能通婚，就这样以皮色的黑白，划分两个世界。三Ｋ党，一个大白种人主义的法西斯恐怖组织。他们对于不服从统治的黑人就私刑拷打，加以枪杀或绞死。在美国北部，虽然形式上比较开明，走路、坐车、进饭馆没有显著的隔离，但黑人一样受到剥削和压迫。在工厂里，工资比白人低，租白人的房子，要付较高的房租；他们不容易找到好职业，多半做着苦力和夜工。有一位黑人同学说：“美国不是我们的祖国。”民族思想正在黑人抬头，仇恨中必然会化成力量，共产党里就有黑人杰出的领袖，黑人迟早会得到解放的。
    除了黑人以外，其他像犹太人、墨西哥人、波多利哥人都受着歧视、剥削和压迫。像有名的爱因斯坦教授，就因为他是犹太人、并且反对制造原子弹，就有人在国会里叫嚣说：“赶那个犹太人回欧洲去！”我国在美的侨民，亦深深受到压迫。在纽约，一月里经常有几起华侨被劫、被打的事情发生，华侨是因为以前在国民党反动统治下不能谋生才出国的，讲起帝国主义，真是人人痛恨。新中国诞生了，华侨才有了真正的祖国。
    （六）对于进步势力的迫害：独占资本家为了巩固他们对广大人民的统治，他们必须镇压进步势力，打击进步力量，迫害进步分子。近年来，几乎天天可以在报纸上看到压迫进步势力的言论和行动。他们用最卑鄙的手段，偷听私人电话，派遣暗探，雇养打手，甚至成立了专门破坏罢工的公司，希特勒所用的格杀打扑的本领，被美国统治阶级更高度更灵活地使用着。
    举一个最典型的例子吧。去年秋间，有名的黑人歌唱家罗伯逊在举行演唱会时，受到非法暴行的阻挠，在八月二十七日，原定演唱那天，反动法西斯势力事先集合了“反共十字军”暴徒三百名堵塞了会场的入口，并把会场工作人员痛打一阵，音乐会因此流产。但这消息流传开去，立即引起广大群众的愤恨。在九月四日那天，重新举行了音乐会，到了二万五千听众，有二千五百人自动挺身出来做纠察，手牵着手，在会场四周，围成了一道防线。这样音乐会顺利地举行了，然而反动派就肯罢休吗？几百暴徒散在会场出口的公路两旁，对乘车回去的听众，一路掷石子，把汽车翻倒，把窗子打碎。同时，政府又派来了几百武装警察，包围了保卫会场的纠察，把有些人打得重伤，搜查了全体和平的纠察人员，最后还捉了几个挨打受伤的人到法庭里审问，指为“暴徒”。
    这些法西斯统治者们，把和平的人们当做暴徒；他们亦用同样的方法对付拥护和平运动的人们，把签名拥护和平的人名，登载在报上，作为威胁；用打手破坏和平运动的集会，把主持和平运动签名的人们抓进监狱，他们妄想用暴力来制止人们对和平的爱好。然而和平运动还是展开了，光在纽约一地，就有五十万以上的人民，冒着威胁和暴力，把名字签在和平宣言上。共产党的十一个领袖虽然受到非法审判和拘禁，但是以美共为首的进步势力正一天天抬头，不久它一定会坚强地站立起来，和世界上所有爱好和平、民主、进步的人民联结成一支巨大无比的力量，把凶恶的美帝国主义粉碎，把腐烂的美资本主义从地面上清除出去。
