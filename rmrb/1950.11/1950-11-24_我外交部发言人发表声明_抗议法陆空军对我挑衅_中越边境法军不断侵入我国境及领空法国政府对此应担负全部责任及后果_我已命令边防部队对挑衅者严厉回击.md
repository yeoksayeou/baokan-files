　　Xinhua News Agency, 23rd: The spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China issued a statement regarding the armed provocations and frequent cross-border bombings and strafing by French land and air forces in the Sino-Vietnamese border area:

　　Since December 1949, the French land and air forces stationed in Vietnam have repeatedly intruded into the territory and airspace of the People's Republic of China in the border areas where Guangdong, Guangxi, and Yunnan provinces meet Vietnam, carrying out armed provocations and strafing and bombing Chinese soldiers and civilians.

　　According to incomplete statistics, from December 14, 1949, to August 31, 1950, in areas such as Dongxing and Fangcheng on the Guangdong-Vietnam border, French army ground forces intruded into our territory once, conducting strafing that resulted in the death or injury of 22 of our residents; in areas such as Longjin, Zhennanguan, Aikou, Ningming, Ping'erguan, Pingxiang, Mingjiang, Sile, Jingxi, and Tianbao on the Guangxi-Vietnam border, the French air force intruded into our airspace a total of 18 times, dispatching a total of 24 military aircraft. In addition to general reconnaissance activities, these aircraft also airdropped clothing, blankets, and other supplies and materials four times to supply the remnants of the Kuomintang bandit leader Yao Huai who were hiding in the mountains of the Sino-Vietnamese border area, and repeatedly strafed peaceful residents in our border areas, resulting in one death and one serious injury; French army ground forces also intruded into our territory armed a total of 22 times, and in addition to mapping and reconnaissance and robbing cattle and horses, also shot and killed two of our residents; in areas such as Hekou, Baxi, Maguan, Maoping, and Malipo on the Yunnan-Vietnam border, French army ground forces intruded into our territory twice, and on March 24 of this year in the Shulan area west of Baxi, robbed our civilian boats, killing 11 of our boatmen and passengers.

　　Beginning in September 1950, these atrocities by the French land and air forces of intruding into our territory and airspace became even more rampant. In the 61 days from September 1 to October 31 alone, according to incomplete statistics, in the above-mentioned Guangdong-Vietnam border area, the French air force intruded into our border twice, dispatching three military aircraft; in the above-mentioned Guangxi-Vietnam border area, the French air force intruded into our airspace 18 times, dispatching a total of 52 military aircraft. In addition to general reconnaissance activities, on October 8, they strafed Shuikouguan southwest of Longjin, wounding two soldiers of our border defense forces and destroying more than 20 civilian houses; on October 11, they dropped five bombs on Ping'erguan, killing one of our soldiers and wounding two; on October 19, they dropped six bombs in Tianbao County, killing more than 30 of our residents, wounding 15, and destroying more than 100 civilian houses and a stone bridge; French army forces intruded into our territory 13 times, shelled and strafed five times, and looted pigs, chickens, and other property without number; in the above-mentioned Yunnan-Vietnam border area, the French air force intruded into our airspace a total of 30 times, dispatching 65 military aircraft, either circling for reconnaissance or strafing and bombing; French army ground forces intruded into our territory armed a total of 10 times, and in addition to harassing and looting cattle, horses, chickens, and ducks, killed two of our residents, injured one, and covered bandits in attacking us twice.

　　The above-mentioned various armed provocations and atrocities of strafing and bombing by the French land and air forces along the Chinese border line over the past eleven months have infringed upon the territorial sovereignty of the People's Republic of China, caused huge losses to the lives and property of our border soldiers and civilians, and exposed the French imperialists' deliberate attitude of hostility towards the Chinese people. The entire Chinese people feel infinite anger towards the serious and bloody crimes of the French imperialists in invading the People's Republic of China. The French government should bear full responsibility and consequences for these shameless and barbaric acts of its troops stationed in Vietnam. The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, in addition to ordering its border defense forces to continue to defend the border and severely counterattack the provocateurs, hereby lodges a serious protest with the French government and reserves all rights to claim compensation for losses and other demands.

    中越边境法军不断侵入我国境及领空
    法国政府对此应担负全部责任及后果
    我已命令边防部队对挑衅者严厉回击
    【新华社二十三日讯】中华人民共和国外交部发言人为中越边境法国陆空部队对我武装挑衅并经常越境轰炸扫射事发表声明如下：
    自一九四九年十二月以来，法国驻越南的陆空部队，曾经不时在我国广东、广西、云南三省与越南交界的边境地带上，擅行侵入我中华人民共和国的国境及领空，实行武装挑衅，并扫射轰炸我国军民。
    依据不完全的统计，由一九四九年十二月十四日至一九五○年八月三十一日，在粤越边境东兴、防城等一带地区，法国陆军地面部队曾侵越我国境一次，进行扫射，死伤我居民二十二人；在桂越边境龙津、镇南关、隘口、宁明、平而关、凭祥、明江、思乐、靖西、天保等一带地区，法国空军前后侵入我领空凡十八次，共出动军用飞机二十四架，这些飞机除了作一般的侦察活动之外，还曾四次空投衣服、毛毯等给养及物资，接济潜伏在中越边境山地的国民党匪首姚槐残部，并曾多次扫射我边境地带的和平居民，以致其中一人中弹身亡，一人身受重伤；法国陆军地面部队复曾武装擅越我国境凡二十二次，除绘图侦察，抢劫牛、马外，并曾枪杀我居民二人；在滇越边境河口、坝西、马关、茅坪、麻栗坡等一带地区，法国陆军地面部队侵我国境凡二次，并于本年三月二十四日在坝西以西书兰地区抢我民船，打死我船夫及乘客十一人。
    从一九五○年九月开始，法国陆空部队这种侵入我国境及领空的暴行，更见变本加厉，仅仅在九月一日至十月三十一日的六十一天中间，依据不完全的统计，在上述粤越边境地区法国空军共侵越我国边境二次，出动军用飞机三架；在上述桂越边境地区法国空军共侵入我国领空十八次，出动军用飞机前后凡五十二架，除作一般侦察活动外，曾于十月八日在龙津西南水口关扫射，伤我边防部队战士二名，打毁民房二十余间；十月十一日在平而关投弹五枚，死我战士一，伤二；十月十九日在天保县投弹六枚，死我居民三十余人，伤十五人，毁民房百余间及石桥一座；法国陆军部队则侵我国境共十三次，炮轰及扫射五次，劫走猪、鸡及其他财物无算；在上述滇越边境地区，法国空军前后共侵入我领空凡三十次，出动军用飞机六十五架，或盘旋侦察，或扫射投弹；法国陆军地面部队曾武装擅越我国境凡十次，除骚扰及劫走牛、马、鸡、鸭外，曾杀死我居民二人，伤一人，并掩护土匪向我进攻二次。
    上述法国陆空部队这十一个月来在中国国境线上的种种武装挑衅和侵入我国领空，实行扫射轰炸的暴行，侵害了我中华人民共和国的领土主权，造成了我边境军民生命财产的巨大损失，并暴露了法国帝国主义者蓄意与中国人民为敌的态度。全中国人民对于法帝国主义者侵略中华人民共和国的严重血腥罪行，感到无限的愤怒。法国政府对于其驻越军队这种种无耻野蛮行为应该担负全部责任及后果。中华人民共和国中央人民政府除已命令其边防部队继续坚守边疆对挑衅者予以严厉回击外，特向法国政府提出严重抗议，并保留提出赔偿损失以及其他要求的一切权利。
