Editor's Note: This article is a partial translation of a New Year's message by Tokuda Kyuichi, leader of the Japanese Communist Party, published in the Japanese progressive magazine "New World" earlier this year in the form of a Q&A with a reporter. The translation was originally published in Guangming Daily, and is reprinted here with corrections.

Reporter: Today, I would like to ask you to give a New Year's message to the readers of "New World" and talk about major issues at home and abroad.

Tokuda: The biggest issue is the atomic bomb, right?

Reporter: Yes.

Tokuda: From the perspective of the international situation, it is more appropriate to talk about the atomic bomb issue than to talk about general issues. Talking about this issue, first, we can understand how the balance between monopoly capital and the working class is changing, and then international and domestic issues will become clear. Second, we can know what impact it has had on the economic panic of capitalist countries and the development of socialist and people's democratic countries, and what impact it has had on Japan. Third, we can talk about political trends, especially the political trends of capitalist countries...

Reporter: Recently, the American magazine "The New Republic" made a so-called "Cold War" commentary, proposing the so-called "three wins, five losses, and one draw."

The so-called "three wins" of capitalist society: First, through foreign aid bills, including the Marshall Plan, the North Atlantic Treaty, etc. The second is Yugoslavia, which proves how much importance they attach to Tito's advance and retreat. The last is the situation in Greece.

The so-called five losses: The first is that the Soviet Union has the atomic bomb, the second is the Chinese revolution; the third is the devaluation of the pound, the collapse of the French and Italian cabinets, and the strikes in the United States. The so-called one draw is that the German question has not been resolved.

This kind of commentary is very problematic, but it also roughly shows that the reversal of the world's balance of power is interesting. At the same time, placing the Soviet Union's possession of the atomic bomb in the first place, above the Chinese revolution, regardless of whether it is correct or not, this is enough to show how much they recognize the importance of the Soviet Union's possession of the atomic bomb.

Tokuda: My basic understanding of the atomic bomb issue is this: in capitalist countries, atomic energy cannot be used for peaceful production in principle. Because the biggest use of atomic energy is as a prime mover, as a huge power resource like electricity.

But if atomic energy is used as power, then the current power, coal, oil and other power resources will become overproduced, and everything will be greatly reversed. All production institutions and social institutions will never be used unless they are comprehensively reformed. If this is done, all production institutions controlled by monopoly capital will collapse. Therefore, atomic energy cannot be used as a power resource, only for manufacturing atomic bombs. Using it as an atomic bomb is still just wasting it with huge equipment.

However, in the Soviet Union, from uranium mining to the manufacture of atomic bombs, all stages can be used for peaceful industries. That is, it can exert its original function as a power resource. In this way, it is truly a leap in the development of power resources. Nothing can compete with it, and this is something we must especially recognize.

Therefore, in the Soviet Union, reversing rivers and turning mountains into fertile fields can now be fully achieved. Therefore, relying on the emergence of atomic energy, vast lands that were previously called barren can be used effectively.

The deserts and semi-deserts of Central Asia, which we used to think had little use value, have undergone major changes today. If we use Michurin's production methods to increase new crops, then productivity will expand dramatically. In the future, Mongolia, the Gobi Desert, Xinjiang, and other barren lands that are several times larger than European "civilized" countries will also be transformed into green and fertile land thanks to the gift of atomic energy. The northern part of Siberia, which is frozen for most of the year, can also be changed by using atomic energy. There, the strong atomic energy from the sun in summer can melt the ice, and we may also use scientific power to make it absorb atomic energy and exert strong productivity.

Reporter: Now the Soviet Union is carrying out massive afforestation and even changing the climate. If we use atomic energy again, the earth's surface will simply change greatly. The Soviet Union is not only carrying out social revolution, but also moving towards the revolution of nature.

Tokuda: Not only that, but further using atomic energy for small power aspects, all the power of urban factories can be changed to use atomic energy to operate. It can also make an entire city or region warm or cold, exerting the function of heating and cooling. Airplanes, ships, etc. can also use its power, and in this way, daily necessities will also be manufactured like a torrent of materials.

The atomic energy produced by this nuclear fission can not only use its explosive power to make bombs, but if it is properly managed and controlled, its atomic energy can make great contributions to mankind. That is to say, the atomic bomb has a strong continuous explosive nature, which makes its explosive nature weaker and more sustainable, and it can be used as power and for the production of peaceful industries. In that case, it can be said that the state of the world will completely change.

Reporter: Please also talk about the relationship between atomic bombs and international issues.

Tokuda: In the world's two camps, atomic energy research is being carried out. The longer the time passes, the more it will weaken due to waste in capitalist countries. On the other hand, the productivity of the people's countries will increase sharply and prosper. As one side declines and the other rises, the distance between their national strengths will become greater.

Using atomic energy to manufacture bombs, that is, engaging in the production of weapons, requires huge sums of money and is extremely wasteful. Therefore, it is necessary to greatly increase taxes. Without increasing taxes, the government will be in debt financially, or inflation will occur. The result of inflation is a major plundering of the working people. The result of plundering is to destroy the economy and life, and to make the current panic even deeper. A good example is the current France.

France has three major troubles: The first is military spending, which requires huge military spending. The French economy cannot support the military spending in Vietnam alone. Madagascar and the African colonies are the same, requiring huge military spending. Because the forces of national liberation are strengthening and increasing, if they want to suppress them, the increase in military spending will weaken their national strength. This is a major reason for the collapse of the French economy.

Another problem is that, in this state, the French ruling class must lead foreign capital to invade in order to maintain the capitalist economy. With the invasion of foreign capital, the surplus materials of foreign countries will follow, which will suppress domestic production. Farmers are even more cruelly oppressed.

The third is the rapid growth of the people's revolutionary forces. In order to suppress the revolutionary forces, it is necessary to further increase expenses. The result of suppressing the revolutionary forces is to invite great chaos in the country.

It is the same in Japan. Therefore, the consumption of atomic weapons competition is unbearable for any big country (referring to capitalist countries).

　　德田球一谈原子弹与原子能
    编者按：本文是日本共产党领袖德田球一在今年初以答记者问的方式在日本进步杂志《新世界》发表的一篇新年感言的节译。译文原载光明日报，兹校正转载如下。
    记者：今天我愿请您对《新世界》的读者发表一段新年感言，就国内外较大的问题谈一谈。
    德田：较大的问题第一要算原子弹罗？
    记者：是的。
    德田：由国际情势来说，谈一般问题，则不如谈谈原子弹问题比较最恰当。谈这问题，第一、可以明了独占资本与工人阶级之间的均势是在怎样变化，从而国际问题、国内问题自可了然。第二、可以知道它对资本主义国家的经济恐慌与社会主义国家及人民民主国家的发展给了什么影响，对日本国内给了什么影响。第三、可以谈到政治动向尤其是资本主义各国的政治动向如何………………
    记者：最近美国《星期周报》杂志，又作了所谓“冷战”的评述，提出所谓“三胜五败一平局”。
    资本主义社会的所谓“三胜”：一是通过对外援助法案，包括马歇尔计划、北大西洋公约等。其次是南斯拉夫，此足证其对铁托的进退是如何重视。最后是希腊的状况。
    所谓五败：第一是苏联有原子弹，其次是中国革命；再其次英镑贬值，法葛义内阁的垮台，美国的罢工。所谓一平局是德国问题还没有得到结局。
    这种评论是很有问题的，但也概略地表现了世界均势的逆转是有趣的。同时，将苏联有原子弹问题列于首位，置于中国革命之上，姑不论其是否正确，这足说明它们怎样地确认了苏联有原子弹的重要性。
    德田：我对原子弹问题基本是这样认识它：在资本主义国家原子能在原则上是不能用于和平生产的。因为原子能最大的用途是用作原动力，是和电力一样作为极大的动力资源使用的。
    但是如果把原子能用作动力，那么现在的电力、煤炭、石油等这些动力资源更要变成生产过剩的东西，一切都要大翻转，所有的生产机构、社会机构若不全面改革，是绝不会被使用的。如果这样做的话，独占资本所支配的所有的生产机构，全要崩坏。因此，不能把原子能用作动力资源，只有用于制造原子弹。用作原子弹依然不过是拿庞大的设备将它白白浪费掉。
    但是在苏联从采铀一直到制造原子弹的过程，这所有的阶段，都能把它用于和平产业上面。也就是发挥了它本来的功能当作动力资源应用。这样一来，真是动力资源的一个飞跃的发展。任何事物也不能和它竞争，这一点我们是要特别认识的。
    因此在苏联使河水逆流、使高山变成沃野等今日已可完全做到。因而，依靠了原子能的出现过去被称为不毛之地的广大土地可以有效地使用了。
    中央亚细亚的沙漠半沙漠我们过去认为使用价值很小的土地，今日已发生了重大的变革。若再用米丘林的生产方式增植新作物，那么生产力更将飞跃的扩大。将来，蒙古、戈壁大沙漠、新疆等比欧洲“文明”国大过几倍的不毛之地也将因原子能的恩赐变成碧绿的肥沃的土地。西伯利亚北部的一年大部时间结冰的地带，利用原子能也可以把它改变。在那里，夏天承受太阳中强烈的原子能可以化开冰冻，我们也可能用科学力量，使其可以吸收原子能而发挥强大的生产力。
    记者：现在苏联进行着绝大的造林甚至可以改变气候，若再利用原子能，地球表面简直要大变了。苏联不仅实行了社会革命，也正朝着大自然革命的方向进行。
    德田：不仅这样，再进一步把原子能用于小的动力方面，都市工厂的所有动力都可改用原子能去操纵。也可以使一都市一地区全体暖起来或冷起来，发挥暖房冷房的功能。飞机轮船等也都可用它的动力，如此一来生活必需品也将像物质的洪流一样制造出来。
    这原子核分解所产生的原子能不仅能利用其爆炸力去制造炸弹，若适当的管理控制其原子能，对人类供献是伟大的。也就是说原子弹具有强大的连续爆炸性，使其爆炸性弱化而有持续性，用作动力、用于和平产业的生产是可能的。那样一来世界的状态可以说要全部为之一变。
    记者：原子弹与国际问题关系，也请谈一谈。
    德田：在世界两个阵营里都从事着原子能的研究工作。时间经过愈久，那么在资本主义国家就会因浪费而趋衰弱，另方面，人民的国家生产力就会骤加增大而趋繁荣，一方下降，一方上升，其国力的距离也就愈远。
    利用原子能去制造炸弹，即从事武器的生产，是要耗费巨资，是极端浪费的。所以要大大增加税额，不增税，在财政上就要负债，或者通货就要膨胀，通货膨胀的结果就是向劳动人民大事劫掠，劫掠的结果就要破坏经济和生活，就使现在的恐慌更陷深一步。很好的范例，就是目前的法兰西。
    法国有三大烦恼问题：第一是军费，它需要巨额军费。只越南一地的军费要求，法国经济就不堪支持。马达加斯加、非洲各殖民地都是一样的要求巨额军费。因为民族解放的力量增强增大，若欲镇压，就会因军费的增涨而使国力疲惫不堪，这是法国经济崩坏的一大原因。
    再一个问题是：在这样状态下，法国统治阶级为维持资本主义的经济，就必须导外资入侵，随着外资的侵入，外国的过剩物资也就接踵而至，这就会压迫国内生产。农民更遭残酷压迫。
    第三是人民革命的力量飞跃的壮大。为了要镇压革命力量，更须进一步再增加费用。镇压革命力量的结果是招来国内的大混乱。
    在日本也是一样的。因此，竞制原子武器的消耗不论在怎样的大国（指资本主义国家）也是不堪忍负的。
