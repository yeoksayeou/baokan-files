　　Hold Gathering to Cheer Off Comrades Going to the Northeast
    [Our Dispatch] The teachers, students, and staff of the Central Academy of Fine Arts held a gathering on the evening of the 11th of this month to see off comrades who volunteered to work in the Northeast. A total of 110 comrades from the school (including the Art Supplies Cooperative) signed up to volunteer to work in the Northeast. Due to work needs and other reasons, a total of four people were formally approved. On the evening of the 11th, teachers and students of the school held a special gathering to see them off. At the meeting, the president, representatives of teachers and students, and the four comrades who volunteered to go to the Northeast all spoke one after another. Mr. Wang Chaowen also said: "There are many different battlefields for fighting the enemy." Comrades who were not approved are reassured to continue their work. Teachers, staff, and workers have all put forward guarantees and requested the trade union to increase work. They unanimously expressed their determination to be the backing of the Volunteers and resolutely defeat the American imperialist aggression. The students then presented gifts and flowers to the four comrades. Amidst warm applause, they held the four comrades aloft and paraded them around the venue.
