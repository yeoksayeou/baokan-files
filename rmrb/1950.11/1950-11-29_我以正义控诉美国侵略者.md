　　I Accuse American Aggressors with Justice
    Chen Huijuan
    I am a Taiwanese person. Today, I want to expose the American imperialists' atrocities of aggression in Taiwan and accuse the American imperialists of occupying my hometown, Taiwan!
    Everyone knows that in 1895, due to the failure of the Sino-Japanese War, the feudal and reactionary Qing government, disregarding the firm opposition of the Taiwanese people, ceded Taiwan to Japan. From that year until 1945, we Taiwanese people lived under the cruel rule of Japanese imperialism for a full fifty years of slavery.
    On August 15, 1945, Japanese imperialism surrendered unconditionally. When this news came, we Taiwanese people were so happy that we were almost driven mad, thinking that we had finally been liberated. Who knew that, in fact, what the Kuomintang reactionaries who took over Taiwan brought to the Taiwanese people was not freedom and democracy, but even greater disasters! The infiltration of American imperialist forces has kept us living as slaves, and even more severely!
    We Taiwanese people are not only threatened by hunger but also by secret agents. In 1946, the American imperialists formally established a consulate and a information office in Taipei. These two institutions were the headquarters of terrifying secret agents. At the same time, libraries were established in various places as its intelligence agencies. Countless American imperialist and Chiang Kai-shek bandit secret agents carried out strict inspections and surveillance of the Taiwanese people. For example, they stipulated a method that if a Communist Party member or sympathizer was discovered, not only would his entire family be shot, but also several families living nearby! Therefore, the Taiwanese people were constantly under the threat of being shot. In this situation, the safety of the people was completely out of the question. Anyone who wanted to kill could kill because as long as they secretly reported to the intelligence bureau, their goal would be achieved.
    In addition, the American imperialists also used various means to oppress the Taiwanese people and harm innocent people. Rape was no longer surprising. Every night after nine o'clock, you could often hear women screaming "Help!" in terror, but no one dared to save her because everyone knew they had guns, and sometimes even machine guns. Later, this situation became even more serious. They organized several rape groups specifically to raid civilian homes or girls' middle schools. For example, a girls' middle school in Keelung was surrounded by armed American soldiers, and some high school girls were taken away in trucks. From then on, our female students didn't even dare to go to school.
    The cruel rule made us Taiwanese people extremely resentful. Finally, the "February 28th Incident," which shook the whole country, broke out. Faced with the fierce resistance movement of the Taiwanese people, Chiang Kai-shek, with the support of the American imperialists, transported more than two divisions of troops to Taiwan and began an unprecedented bloody massacre of the Taiwanese people. In this incident, more than 30,000 of our compatriots were killed, and countless others were arrested, imprisoned, or assassinated! What I cannot forget especially is what a classmate who witnessed this told me: after the American and Chiang Kai-shek bandits captured our patriotic elements, they tied them tightly, put them on trucks, and held reactionary demonstrations throughout the city. Then, they pulled the arrested compatriots off the trucks and shot them one by one in front of the masses. At this moment, several Americans arrived in jeeps to take pictures. We deeply realized that the American imperialists are our enemies, beasts! Although this revolutionary movement was suppressed, and many compatriots were brutally massacred, the courage of our Taiwanese people was not diminished at all, but strengthened day by day. Our resentment also deepened day by day!
    Now the hateful American imperialists, disregarding the opposition of all people, are carrying out a cruel war of aggression in Korea and constantly carrying out armed provocations against our country, wanting to turn Korea and our China into their colonies.
    Comrades! Compatriots! I can no longer endure it! I want to accuse the American aggressors with justice! I want to fight to the end with all my strength for the complete liberation of the Korean people and for the defense of our beloved motherland! I want to eliminate the American aggressors in Korea and strive for the early liberation of our hometown—Taiwan!

　　我以正义控诉美国侵略者
    陈蕙娟
    我是一个台湾人，今天我想揭露美帝在台湾的侵略兽行，控诉美帝侵占我的故乡——台湾！
    大家都很知道，一八九五年由于中日战争的失败，封建反动的满清政府不顾台湾人民的坚决反对，把台湾割让给日本了。从那一年起，一直到一九四五年，我们台湾人民在日本帝国主义残酷的统治之下，整整过了五十年的奴隶生活。
    一九四五年八月十五日日本帝国主义无条件投降。这消息传来，我们台湾人民都高兴得快发疯了。以为从此获得了解放。谁知道，事实上，接收台湾的国民党反动派带给台湾人民的，并不是自由和民主，而是更大的灾祸！美帝的侵略势力的渗入，使我们依然过着奴隶生活，并且更厉害！
    我们台湾人民不仅受着饥饿的威胁，还受着特务的威胁。一九四六年，美帝在台北正式成立领事馆和新闻处。这两个机关就是恐怖的特务总部。同时在各地还设立图书馆，作为它的情报机关。无数的美帝特务、蒋匪特务对台湾人民实行严密的检查和监视。例如他们规定了一种办法，如果发现了一个共产党分子或其同情者，那么不仅要枪杀他一家人，而且还要枪毙住在附近的数家人！因此台湾人民要时时刻刻受着被枪杀的威胁。在这样情况下，人民的安全是完全谈不到的。谁想要杀人，谁都可以杀。因为只要密告给情报局，那么他的目的就达到了。
    此外，美帝还用种种手段来欺压台湾人民，残害无辜的人民。强奸，已是不使人惊讶的事情了。每天夜晚九点以后，常常可以听到女人恐怖地喊“救命！”的声音，但谁也不敢去救她。因为谁也知道他们有枪，甚至有时还带着机关枪呢。后来这种情况更厉害了。他们组织了几个强奸组，专门突击民家或女子中学。如基隆的一女中被武装的美军包围起来，把高中的一些女学生用卡车带走了。从此，我们女学生连上学校都不敢上了。
    残酷的统治，使我们台湾人民愤恨到了极点。终于爆发了震动全国的“二、二八”事件。面对着激烈的台湾人民的反抗运动，蒋介石得到美帝的支持，运送两师以上的部队到台湾来，对台湾人民开始了空前的血腥屠杀。在这次事件中，我们同胞被杀的在三万人以上，其他被捕下狱或暗杀的更不知多少！尤其使我不能忘记的，是亲眼看到这事情的一个同学告诉我的：美蒋匪帮捉捕我们爱国分子后，把他们绑得紧紧，投到卡车上，在全市举行反动的示威游行。然后他们把被捕的同胞们从卡车上拉下来，在群众面前，一个个枪毙了。正在这时候，几个美国人坐吉普车来到这里照像了。我们深深地认识了美帝是我们的敌人，是一个野兽！虽然这次的革命运动，遭到了镇压，同胞们被残酷地屠杀了不少，但我们台湾人民的勇气毫未减弱，反而一天比一天加强。我们的愤恨也一天比一天加深！
    现在可恶的美帝国主义者不顾一切人民的反对，在朝鲜进行着残酷的侵略战争，并不断向我国进行武装挑衅，想把朝鲜和我们中国变做他们的殖民地。
    同志们！同胞们！我再也不能忍耐下去了！我要以正义控诉美国侵略者！我要为朝鲜人民的彻底解放，为保卫我们亲爱的祖国，尽所有的力量奋斗到底！我要在朝鲜消灭美国侵略者，争取我们的故乡——台湾早日解放！
