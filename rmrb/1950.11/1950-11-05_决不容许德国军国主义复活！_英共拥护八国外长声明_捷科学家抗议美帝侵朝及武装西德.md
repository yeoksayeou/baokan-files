Xinhua News Agency, London, October 30th, via Telecommunications Agency: The Political Committee of the Communist Party of Great Britain issued a statement supporting the declaration on the future of Germany made at the Prague meeting of the Foreign Ministers of the Soviet Union and seven other countries, considering it "a very important contribution to the cause of peace." The Political Committee called on all peace-loving and democratic people in Britain to give full support to the Prague proposals and to oppose the US imperialist policies towards Germany, which are harmful to the interests of the German people and aimed at preparing for aggressive war.

The statement pointed out that the measures taken by the US imperialist bloc to rearm West Germany and restore its war potential threaten the security of Britain and all European countries, and also harm the interests of the German people themselves. Millions of people in France, Italy, and Britain are determined to prevent the implementation of this policy; the German people, represented by the Foreign Minister of the German Democratic Republic who attended the Prague meeting, have also sternly condemned the Western countries' policy of using the German people as cannon fodder and turning Germany into their military base.

The statement concluded: The revival of German militarism after the First World War was a crime that cost the lives of millions of Britons. Such a thing must not be allowed to happen again.

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, November 2nd, via Telecommunications Agency: Czechoslovak scientific workers have issued a statement protesting against the US imperialists' aggression in Korea and the remilitarization of West Germany, and calling on scientists to participate in the struggle for peace. The statement said: "Scientific workers all know that, in fact, true science is on the side of human progress." The statement also stated that in the various people's democracies, science "is developed by socialist construction and serves socialist construction."

　　决不容许德国军国主义复活！
    英共拥护八国外长声明
    捷科学家抗议美帝侵朝及武装西德
    【新华社四日讯】据电通社伦敦十月三十日讯：英国共产党政治委员会发表声明，拥护在布拉格举行的苏联等八国外长会议关于德国前途的声明，认为它是“对和平事业的十分重要的贡献”。政治委员会号召英国所有和平民主的爱好者给布拉格建议以充分的支持，并反对美帝国主义所厘订的危害德国人民利益和旨在准备侵略战争的对德政策。
    声明指出：美帝国主义集团所采取的重新武装西德和恢复其战争潜能的措施，威胁着英国和所有欧洲国家的安全，也危害德国人民本身的利益。法国、意大利和英国的千百万人民决心阻止这一政策的实行；由出席布拉格会议的德意志民主共和国外交部长所代表的德国人民，也已严正斥责了西方国家利用德国人民充当炮灰和变德国为其军事基地的政策。
    声明最后称：第一次世界大战后使德国军国主义复活是一种罪恶，它会使千千万万的英国人牺牲了生命。这样的事情一定不许它再次发生。
    【新华社讯】电通社布拉格二日电：捷克斯洛伐克科学工作者顷发表声明，抗议美帝国主义者侵略朝鲜及重使西德军事化，并号召科学家参加争取和平的斗争。该声明称：“科学工作者们都知道，事实上真正的科学是在人类的进步一方面的。”该声明并称，在各人民民主国家里，科学“是由社会主义建设发展出来并且为社会主义建设服务的”。
