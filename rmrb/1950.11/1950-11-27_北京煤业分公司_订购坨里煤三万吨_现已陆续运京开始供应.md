    Beijing Coal Branch Company
    Orders 30,000 Tons of Tuoli Coal
    Supply to Beijing Has Begun
    [This newspaper's report] The Beijing Coal Branch Company of the China Coal Industry Construction Materials Company, in order to ensure the capital's coal supply, enhance coal supply capacity, and maintain reasonable and stable coal prices, has signed a contract with the Jingxi Mining Bureau to purchase 30,000 tons of Tuoli coal. This Tuoli coal production is of no lesser quality than Mentougou coal and is extremely suitable for making briquettes, commonly known as "Nanshan Gaomo." Currently, the company, through the Liangxiang County Cooperative, has organized more than 700 carts to actively transport the coal from Tuoli to Liangxiang Station, shipping approximately 700 tons to Beijing every day, and has already put it on sale. This not only enriches the coal supply and supports the mine's production but also solves the livelihood problems of nearly 700 cart-owning households and some disaster victims in Liangxiang County.

　　北京煤业分公司
    订购坨里煤三万吨
    现已陆续运京开始供应
    【本报讯】中国煤业建筑器材公司北京煤业分公司，为了保证首都用煤，增强煤炭供应力量与保持煤价合理平稳，已与京西矿务局签订了收购坨里煤合同，数量共三万吨。按坨里产煤，煤质不次于门头沟煤，极适合摇制煤球之用，俗称“南山高末”。现该公司通过良乡县合作社，组织了七百余辆大车，积极从坨里向良乡车站搬运，每日向京调运约在七百余吨，并已挂牌出售。这样，不但充实了煤炭供应，且扶植了矿方生产，同时解决了良乡县就近七百辆大车户及部分灾民的生活问题。
