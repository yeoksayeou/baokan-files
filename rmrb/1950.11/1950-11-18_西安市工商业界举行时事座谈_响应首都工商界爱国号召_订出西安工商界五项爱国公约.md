Over 60 people attended, including heads of various industrial and commercial sectors in the city, managers of independent factories, and democratic figures from the industrial and commercial community. The symposium responded to the patriotic pledges formulated by the industrial and commercial circles of Beijing. During the symposium, Ye Yu, a member of the preparatory committee of the Federation of Industry and Commerce and manager of the Xi'an San Acids Factory, first explained the aggressive ambitions of American imperialism and the significance of supporting the Korean people in defending China. He called on industrialists and merchants in Xi'an to follow the spirit of the joint declaration of the democratic parties, deeply understand this situation, and take practical actions to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend the nation by intensifying production, engaging in legitimate business practices, and responding to all government calls.

Everyone unanimously expressed their support for the joint declaration of the democratic parties and called on industrialists and merchants throughout the city to take practical actions to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend the nation.

During the meeting, five patriotic pledges were formulated for the industrial and commercial circles of Xi'an: (1) Contribute all efforts to support voluntary actions to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend the nation; (2) Clearly distinguish between enemies and friends, stand firm, eliminate all fear of America, refute the fallacies spread by American warmongers and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and prevent bandits and special agents from spreading rumors and engaging in activities; (3) Assist the government in stabilizing prices, rigorously expose unscrupulous elements engaged in hoarding, speculation, and disruption of finance; (4) Intensify production, facilitate the flow of materials, and strengthen our fighting power; (5) Strengthen current affairs study so that every industrialist and merchant has a clear understanding of the crimes of American imperialism.
