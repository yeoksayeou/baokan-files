    【新华社讯】塔斯社雅典九日电：《民主报》发表了喀尔基拉岛（科学）一百一十个居民的来信。他们要求他们的同胞坚决宣布：“给人民面包，而不要子弹；拖拉机，不要坦克；工作，不要暗杀；和平，不要战争！”该报又发表了喀尔基拉岛六十九名和平战士的来信，并称：斯德哥尔摩宣言的签名正从英雄的克里特岛寄来；“这个岛是外国战争挑拨者军事准备的中心，他们正把这个岛变成他们侵略计划的基地。”该报并刊登了罕拉克里恩的二十八个公民签名的来信和克里特岛上两个村庄的来信。其中一个村庄有二十三人在斯德哥尔摩宣言上签了名，另一个村庄则有四十七人签了名。
    另一期《民主报》则发表了加尼亚的巴纳奥泰基斯的来信，他的独生子被希特勒匪帮枪决了。他写道：“我把我的名字签在斯德哥尔摩宣言上，就是号召每一个人跟随我的榜样。只有贩卖鲜血的贩子、暴虐狂的人和疯子才会拒绝在和平宣言上签名。”
    《民主报》并且报道说：土巴（萨罗尼加近郊的工人区）居民二百四十六人已在斯德哥尔摩宣言上签了名，此外签名的尚有希腊北部的居民四十八人和雅典的手艺工人六十三名。
