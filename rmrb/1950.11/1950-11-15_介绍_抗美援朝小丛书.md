　　Introducing the "Resist America, Aid Korea" Small Booklet Series
　　Now, in response to the Chinese people's movement to Resist America, Aid Korea, protect our homes and defend our country, the People's Publishing House has compiled and published this series of small booklets (distributed by Xinhua Bookstore), which is very timely. Here is an introduction to the four types that have already been published:
    One, "American Imperialism's Aid to Chiang to Enslave China" (written by Qin Linshu): This book explains how, after World War II, American imperialism replaced Japanese imperialism and, through aiding the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, attempted to monopolize China and enslave the Chinese people. From the "Double Tenth Agreement" between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party in 1945, through the Marshall "mediation," Chiang Kai-shek launched a counter-revolutionary civil war, until the American imperialist occupation of Taiwan, the behind-the-scenes manipulation by American imperialism is fully exposed in this book; and, combined with the current situation, it clearly points out the strength of our people's power, the essence of American imperialism's aggressive policy, and the reasons for its inevitable demise.
    Two, "How Did American Imperialism Invade Korea?" (written by Yu Chongwen): This book first provides a relatively systematic narrative of the process of American imperialism's invasion of Korea. Then, it exposes the various conspiracies and tricks of American imperialism's invasion of Korea, as well as its attempts to expand the war, invade our country, and threaten peace in the Far East. The writing is clear, logical, and easy to understand. In particular, the enumeration of various ironclad evidence of American imperialism's crimes arouses a sense of hatred for American imperialism in readers. In addition, the concrete depiction of the American military as a paper tiger is particularly helpful in helping readers understand the true incompetence of the American military.
    Three, "How Does American Imperialism Support Japan?" (written by Zhai Yiwo): Here, the author uses concrete examples and statistics to explain how, in the five years of American occupation, Japan has become a hotbed of fascism and gradually become the main military base of American imperialism in the Far East. We know that MacArthur initially entered Japan as the Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces, and his task was to thoroughly implement the "decisions of the Potsdam Declaration," but in fact, his actions were completely contrary to the spirit of the "Potsdam Declaration." After reading this booklet, we can clearly see the following points: (1) How American imperialism is actively arming Japan; (2) Delaying the Allied peace treaty with Japan; (3) Canceling the Japanese reparations plan; (4) Releasing Japanese war criminals; (5) Supporting Japanese reactionary forces; (6) Reviving Japanese military industry; (7) Restoring Japanese militaristic education; (8) Persecuting Japanese democratic forces.
    Four, "American Monopoly Capital" (written by Xu Bingrang): The first part of this book is "The Current Situation of American Monopoly Capital," using concrete facts and figures to illustrate the inequality of wealth, the concentration of production, and the concentration of capital in the United States, briefly introducing the financial oligarchs' control of the American economy. The second part is "The Domestic Rule of American Monopoly Capital," focusing on explaining that monopoly capital is the real ruler of the United States. How it controls the government, how it determines American policy. The third part is "The Foreign Rule of American Monopoly Capital," focusing on explaining how monopoly capital manipulates American foreign policy. How monopoly capital strives for world hegemony, how it invades Europe, Asia, Africa, and Latin America. The fourth part is "American Monopoly Capital and World War," focusing on the two points that monopoly capital is the root of war, and that monopoly capital will inevitably be destroyed in war. It also uses facts to illustrate how American monopoly capital made fortunes in the two world wars, why it clamors for war, and how it profited from the war of aggression against Korea.

　　介绍“抗美援朝小丛书”
　　时
    为了响应中国人民抗美援朝保家卫国运动，人民出版社编刊这套小丛书（新华书店发行）是非常切合时宜的。这里把已经出版的四种介绍一下：
    一、“美帝援蒋奴役中国”（秦林舒著）：本书说明美帝在第二次世界大战后，怎样代替日本帝国主义，通过援助蒋介石匪帮，企图独占中国、奴役中国人民的事实。从一九四五年国共“双十会谈”起，经过马歇尔“调处”、蒋介石发动反人民内战，直到美帝侵占台湾为止，美帝在幕后操纵的情形，在本书中全盘暴露无遗；并结合目前形势，明确地指出咱们人民力量的强大、美帝侵略政策的本质及其必然走向灭亡的原因。
    二、“美帝怎样侵略朝鲜的？”（余崇文著）：这本书首先对美帝侵略朝鲜的过程，作了较有系统的叙述。接着揭露了美帝侵朝的各种阴谋诡计，以及妄图扩大战争、侵略我国、威胁远东和平的事实。文字条理清楚，通俗易解。特别是列举美帝罪行的种种铁证，使读者发生仇视美帝的心理。此外对美军纸老虎的具体描绘，尤足以帮助读者明了美军无能的真情实况。
    三、“美帝怎样扶日？”（翟一我著）：作者在这里用了具体的事例和统计数字，说明五年来日本在美帝占领下，怎样变成了法西斯主义的温床，怎样逐渐成为美帝在远东的主要军事基地。我们知道，麦克阿瑟当初是以盟军最高统帅身份进驻日本的，他的任务应该是彻底实现“波茨坦宣言的决定”，可是事实上他的所作所为，和“波茨坦宣言”的精神完全背道而驰。读了这本小册子之后，我们可以清楚地看到下列诸点：（一）美帝如何在积极武装日本；（二）拖延盟国对日和约；（三）取消日本赔偿计划；（四）释放日本战犯；（五）扶植日本反动势力；（六）复活日本军事工业；（七）恢复日本军国主义教育；（八）迫害日本民主力量。
    四、“美国的独占资本”（徐秉让著）：本书第一部分是“美国独占资本的现状”，用具体的事实和数字说明美国贫富不均、生产集中和资本集中的情况，简略地介绍了金融寡头控制美国经济的情形。第二部分是“美国独占资本的国内统治”，着重在说明独占资本是美国的真正统治者。它怎样控制政府，怎样决定美国的政策。第三部分是“美国独占资本的国外统治”，着重在说明独占资本怎样操纵美国的对外政策。独占资本怎样争取世界霸权，怎样侵略欧洲、亚非洲和拉丁美洲。第四部分是“美国独占资本和世界大战”，中心在说明独占资本是战争的根源，和独占资本必然在战争中被毁灭两点。也用事实说明美国的独占资本怎样在两次大战中发财，为什么要叫嚣战争，怎样在侵朝战争中赚取利润。
