　　Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 4th: The Northeast People's Government has begun issuing 13 million shares of the 1950 second phase of production and construction unit-linked bonds within the Northeast region from November 3rd. It is expected that the sales will be basically completed within the next month. The scope of issuance for these bonds is mainly in large, medium, and small cities, with large and medium cities as the focus. Because a large amount of new grain is still entering the market, sales will not be conducted in rural areas for the time being.
　　Note: The Northeast People's Government decided in February of this year to issue 30 million shares of the 1950 production and construction unit-linked bonds, to be issued in two phases, the first and second halves of the year. The issuance of the first phase of 17 million shares was successfully completed in March. The value of the second phase of bonds is the same as the first phase, with each share calculated based on the total market price of five *jin* of sorghum rice, one *chi* of Five Blessings Cloth, five *jin* of granulated salt, and thirty-four *jin* of raw coal in Shenyang City.

　　东北人民政府发行今年下期建设公债
    【新华社沈阳四日电】东北人民政府已于十一月三日起在东北区内发行一九五零年度下期生产建设折实公债一千三百万分，预定于下月内基本推销完毕。这项公债的发行范围主要为各大、中、小城市，其中又以大、中城市为重点。因为新粮尚有大量上市，故暂不在农村中推销。
    按：东北人民政府今年二月间决定发行一九五零年生产建设折实公债三千万分，分上、下两期发行。上期一千七百万分的发行工作已于三月间胜利结束。下期公债的价值与上期相同，每分以沈阳市高粱米五市斤、五福布一市尺、粒盐五市斤、原煤三十四市斤的市价总合计算。
