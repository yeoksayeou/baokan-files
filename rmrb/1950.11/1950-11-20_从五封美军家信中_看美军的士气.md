　　The low morale of the American soldiers in Korea can be seen from some of the letters home picked up on the battlefield.

　　On November 1st, the Korean People's Army, with the assistance of the Chinese People's Volunteers, annihilated a part of a certain regiment of the 1st Cavalry Division of the American invading army in the battle near Unsan. While cleaning up the battlefield, several letters home belonging to an American soldier named Clarence Smoserman were found in an American truck. One letter was written to him by his mother on September 25th. The first sentence of the mother's letter was, "I am very happy to know that you are safe." Smoserman's mother, concerned about her son's uncertain future and life or death, "pays close attention to the news every day, and it seems the war will end soon." The American reactionary press trumpeted the Korean War as an easy matter. Only then did countless American mothers believe that their children might return home soon. However, time is a ruthless witness. Smoserman's mother became impatient and asked her son, "Don't forget to pray to God, but how long will it take for you to come back? I am eagerly waiting for you to return!" The mother's heart has run with her son to the Korean battlefield, and she cares about her son's warmth: "Do you have enough warm clothes? I hear they say it's below zero there, and I'm really worried." In the end, the mother helplessly expressed her only hope: "God bless you and keep you safe, God will bring you back to me." In addition, there are three letters from Smoserman's sister, Dana, who had just turned seventeen. The sister couldn't hide her desire for her brother to return home. In her letter of September 9th, she began by saying, "We were originally planning for you to come home in October." Then she described the conscription situation in her hometown: "Helmond plans to enlist in the army, and Mom and Emmeretta are trying to dissuade him. But he said that only by joining the army can he get some money to build a house! That's all he can do! ... If they continue to conscript, there won't be many boys left here." The American warmongers are using all kinds of tempting tricks, using making a fortune to support the family to trick people into joining the army. However, mothers, wives, and sisters would rather go hungry and cold than send their loved ones to die for a little money from Wall Street. There was also a letter from Smoserman's lover, Barbara, written on September 7th, filled with sentimental sentences: "I will be very sad if I don't receive your letter," "I understand what I will become, especially now, if I don't receive your letter for a long time!" No matter how much the mother, sister, and lover hope that Smoserman will return sooner, their hopes have turned into tears. Smoserman's life and death cannot be determined now. But as long as Wall Street's greedy claws do not withdraw from Korea for a day, the Korean People's Army will continue to fight it until it completely drives the invaders out of the country. It is not just one Smoserman who will be captured or die, but countless Smosermans will continue to be transferred from the United States to be captured or die on the Korean battlefield. It is not only Smoserman's mother who cries for her dead son, but countless American mothers who will ask: "How long will it take for you to come back?" Finally, they have no choice but to cry for their dead sons. The war in Korea is the war of Truman, Acheson, and MacArthur, the war of Wall Street. It is a war of aggression cursed by American soldiers and their mothers, sisters, and lovers.

### 从五封美军家信中  看美军的士气

　　从五封美军家信中
    看美军的士气
    在朝鲜的美军的士气不高，可以战场上所拾得的部分家信中得到证明。
    十一月一日，朝鲜人民军在我国人民志愿军协助作战下，于云山附近战斗里，歼灭了美国侵略军骑兵第一师某联队的一部。打扫战场时，在美军的一辆卡车上发现一个名叫克拉伦斯·斯摩塞曼的美军的几封家信。有一封是九月二十五日他的母亲写给他的，母亲信上第一句就是“知道你无恙，心里非常高兴。”斯摩塞曼的母亲为了孩子的不可知的生死前途，“每天都很注意新闻，看来战争很快就要结束的。”美国反动派报纸把朝鲜战争吹嘘成轻而易举的事。才使无数的美国母亲认为孩子们有很快回家的可能。不过时间是无情的证人，斯摩塞曼的母亲等得不耐了，她向他的孩子问道：“不要忘了向上帝祷告，但是到底要多久你才能回来呢？我一心盼着你回来啊！”母亲的心随着孩子跑到朝鲜的战场上了，她关怀着儿子的冷热：“你有够暖的衣服么？听他们说那边在零度以下，我真是挂念的很。”母亲在最后无可奈何地说出了她唯一的希望：“上帝保佑你平安，上帝会把你带回来给我的。”另外有三封是斯摩塞曼的刚刚渡过十七周岁的妹妹戴娜的信，妹妹掩盖不住盼着哥哥回家的心情，在她的九月九日的一封信上开头就说，“我们原在计划着你十月里能回家”，接着她又叙述了家乡的征兵情形：“海尔蒙打算去应征参加军队，妈妈和爱玛勒塔正在劝阻。但是他说，只有去当兵才能弄些钱来盖座房子啊！他能做的就这么多啊！……如果他们继续征下去的话，这里的男孩子就剩下不多了。”美国的战争贩子们使用着一切诱惑的技俩，以发财养家来骗人当兵，但是，母亲和妻子、妹妹宁愿挨饿受冻也要拉着他们的亲人，不为华尔街一点金钱送命。另外还有一封信是斯摩塞曼的爱人巴尔巴拉于九月七日写的信，信中充满着感伤的句子：“如果得不到你的信，我会非常难过的”，“我明白，特别是现在，长时间接不到你的信，我会变成什么样子！”不管母亲、妹妹和爱人如何盼望着斯摩塞曼早些回去，但是她们的希望是化成眼泪了。斯摩塞曼的生死如何，现在还不能断定。但是只要华尔街贪婪的魔掌一天不自朝鲜撤出，朝鲜人民军便要继续跟它作战，直至完全驱逐侵略者出境为止。不止一个斯摩塞曼要被俘、要死去，而是无数的斯摩塞曼要继续从美国调来，在朝鲜战场上被俘或死去。不止斯摩塞曼的母亲为死去的儿子哭泣，而是无数的美国的母亲要发问：“到底要多久你才回来呢？”最后不得不为死去的儿子哭泣。在朝鲜的战争是杜鲁门、艾奇逊和麦克阿瑟的战争，是华尔街的战争。它是美国士兵和他们的母亲、妹妹和爱人所诅咒的侵略战争。
