　　Yanjing University Chemistry, Education, and Economics departments held a current affairs discussion meeting on the 4th. First, Professor He from the History Department of the Teachers College, who had just returned from the United States, spoke about his experiences in the United States for more than three years. He said: During the May 1st Labor Day, when workers held demonstrations in New York, the American government staged a ridiculous "parade" in an attempt to attract citizens. As a result, the worker's parade area still had more spectators. In the United States, police often pull workers down from telephone poles when they put up slogans. Black people and white people in America cannot enter the same church door or ride the same bus. These all expose the true face of "democracy," "freedom," and "equality" that American imperialism promotes. With the expansion of American imperialist wars of aggression in the world, the political consciousness of the American people has gradually increased. Therefore, the United States is now no different from a volcano, and there will be a day when it erupts. Professor He's speech gave the students a more concrete understanding of the United States. Then, the students analyzed the essence of American imperialist aggression from political, economic, and cultural perspectives. Everyone deeply felt that American imperialism is our only mortal enemy and our most insidious enemy who kills without spilling blood. Its past aggression against us made us unconscious. For example, John Leighton Stuart was superficially kind, seemingly an educator who ran education in China. During Christmas, he even gave each student two apples and a bag of candy, which seemed like goodwill, but in reality, he harbored malicious intentions, containing countless toxins. In fact, he was a ringleader of spies, organizing many spies to carry out espionage activities in our country. We have now seen through his conspiracy and, like all the Chinese people, extremely hate him. Student Hu Zongmin also said: "We can also see its cruelty from the American imperialist atrocities in Korea. It first pours gasoline on villages and then bombs them, to increase the death toll of the people. This is even more cruel than Japanese imperialism!" After recalling the tragic situation during the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan, student Li Songfang said: "Now China has reached its most dangerous moment again. My father was forced to death by the Japanese, and my hatred for the Japanese is countless. After the victory, I thought there was hope, but the United States has never relaxed its aggression against China. Now, not only has it armed our enemy Japan, but the cruelty of American imperialism is even greater than that of Japan. I must avenge my father!"

　　After recalling the atrocities of the Japanese bandits and the American imperialists in helping Chiang Kai-shek slaughter and trample on the Chinese people, and expressing their determination to resist American imperialism with indignation, each student expressed that they would write letters to their relatives and friends to tell them about the crimes of American imperialism that they knew, so that they would also recognize this vicious beast.

　　燕大化学系等同学举行座谈
　　剖析美帝侵略本质
    拟分别写信给亲友揭露美帝暴行
    【本报讯】燕京大学化学、教育、经济三系同学在四日举行了一个时事讨论会。先由新由美国回来的师大历史系何教授讲述了他在美国三年多来的见闻。他说：在“五一”劳动节，工人队伍在纽约举行示威的时候，美国政府又另外搅了一个滑稽性的“游行”想来吸引市民。结果，还是工人游行区域的观众多。在美国常有警察将爬在电线杆上贴标语的工人拉下来。美国的黑人与白人不能同进一个教堂的门，不能同乘一部车。这些都揭破了美帝所宣传的“民主”、“自由”、“平等”的真面目。随着美帝在世界上侵略战争的扩大，美国国内人民政治觉悟已逐步提高。所以美国国内现在无异是一座火山，总有爆发的一天。何教授的讲话，使同学们对美国有了更进一步的具体了解。然后同学们又从政治上、经济上、文化上来分析美帝的侵略本质，大家深深觉得美帝是我们目前唯一的死敌，是我们最阴险的杀人不见血的敌人。它过去对我们的侵略，使我们不自觉。如司徒雷登，表面上仁慈，好象是个在中国办教育的教育家。在度圣诞节时，还给每个同学两只苹果，一包糖，看去似乎是善意，实际上他是不怀好意的，其中包含无数的毒素。实际上他是一个特务头子，组织许多特务分子在我国进行间谍活动。我们现已看清他的阴谋，和全中国人民一样都在极端痛恨他。胡宗民同学还说：“我们从朝鲜的美帝侵略暴行中，也可以看出它的狠毒来。它先用汽油洒在村庄上，然后投弹轰炸，以加多人民的死亡。这一点比日本帝国主义还要残忍！”李松芳同学回忆八年抗战时的惨状后说：“现在中国又到最危险的时候了。我的父亲被日本人逼死，我对日本人的仇恨数不清。胜利后以为有了希望，但美国一直不放松对中国的侵略，现在不但武装了我们的敌人日本，美帝的残暴更甚于日本，我一定要为父亲报仇！”
    同学们在回忆了日寇和美帝帮助蒋介石屠杀、蹂躏中国人民的暴行，并愤慨地表示了自己的抗击美帝的决心以后，每个同学都表示要将自己所认识的美帝罪行，写信告诉自己的亲友，也让他（她）们认识这个恶毒的禽兽。
