Reader's Voice

	Comrade Wang Hua sent us a letter with opinions on "The Korean Question," published by Shanghai Dazhong Bookstore, compiled by Xu Zhe, and translated by Wu Yinggao. The letter states:

	"The translation of this book completely demonstrates a situation of undigested copying. The original is a current affairs book, but the translator's understanding of current affairs appears unusually unfamiliar and vague. For example, the book actually translates "United Nations General Assembly" into "League of Nations General Assembly" and "Small General Assembly" into "League of Nations Small General Assembly." The "United Nations" in the original book becomes the "League of Nations" in the translation. "Gromyko" is translated into "Klumoke," "TASS" becomes "TASS Communications," "Malik" becomes "Malik," and the war-monger Dulles is translated as "Taleis" (page 79) in one instance, "Ta'erleishi" (page 80) in another, and "Deleishi" in a third. The notorious Lie is translated as "Le Yi." This is already absurd enough. There are many terms in the translation that are simply incomprehensible, such as "single administration," "single election," "anti-trust movement," as well as things like "shipment," "tricks," "wild ambition," and "nature," which are simply outrageous!

	To give another example of the translation, on page four of the book, quoting Churchill's letter to Stalin on January 6, 1945, the text is:

	"Because very difficult battles are being fought in the west, the Supreme Command often demands major decisions, and after temporarily losing creativity, how uneasy it feels to stand in a position where one must prevent a broad front, I believe Your Excellency will know this problem based on your own experience. Can the Russian army launch a major offensive against the Belgian front or its vicinity within a month, or at a time that Your Excellency deems appropriate? Can we have a little hope? I would be most grateful for early notification..." (See History Fabricators)

	How should this passage be understood? I compared it to the Xinhua Bookstore version: "Exposing History Fabricators," the translation is as follows:

	"The battles on the Western front are urgent, and the Supreme Command must make decisive decisions. Your Excellency, based on your own experience, deeply understands how critical it is to defend an extremely vast front after temporarily losing the initiative. ... Hoping that Your Excellency will inform us in advance whether we can rely on the Russian army to launch a large-scale offensive on the Vistula River front or elsewhere in January, and hoping that Your Excellency will also inform us of any other matters you wish to disclose... Please reply promptly."

	Comparing the two, the clarity and obscurity are obvious. This is just one example, and turning the Vistula River front into the Belgian front is even more inexplicable. There are too many other incomprehensible places to list them all.

	This book, in terms of its political content, is a good book; but because of the translator's carelessness and irresponsibility, it has become a bad book that readers cannot tolerate. I hope that the publisher can thoroughly revise this book, re-typeset it, and sell it."

	Editor's Note: Comrade Sheng Shuren also sent a letter criticizing "The Korean Question," and raised the same opinions as Comrade Wang Hua.

	Comrade Lin Mu sent us the following letter from Xi'an:

	"The Propaganda Department of the Northwest Working Committee of the Communist Youth League compiled and printed a book called "Land Reform Documents." Due to a careless work style, this book exhibited many serious errors in proofreading, which not only blurred the readers' viewpoints but also distorted our entire policy. For example, in the book, Article 9, Explanation 2 of the "Decision on Some Issues in Land Reform," "For the vagrant ringleaders who actively participated in counter-revolution," was printed as "For the vagrant ringleaders who actively participated in revolution." In Article 13, Item 2, "Not changed according to the original composition" became "Changed according to the original composition." Furthermore, in Chairman Ma Mingfang of Shaanxi Province's "Report on Land Reform and General Work Tasks in Shaanxi Province," "Reach neutral rich peasants" was mistakenly written as "Reach neutral middle peasants." These are all extremely serious errors. This is a book of 116 pages, and during the second edition, 121 errors were found, with the errata sheet taking up five pages. Approximately 5,000 copies were printed in the first edition in early August, and 15,000 copies were printed in the second edition in September. After publication, many readers raised opinions, and finally, the Working Committee decided to stop selling it. There is still no accurate statistic on how many copies remain. So many serious errors occurred in compiling and printing "Land Reform Documents," which is a result of sloppy work and irresponsibility to readers. I am reporting this matter to draw the attention of public and private publishing workers, because stopping sales in fact also causes a waste of people's property."

	Comrade Zhang Luo from Wuxi sent a letter emphasizing the importance of proofreading work, and advocated establishing a responsible system for proofreaders—listing the names of book and periodical proofreaders on the copyright page, just like the authors and compilers. His letter also raised another issue, saying:

	"Shortcomings in proofreading work may also be related to the compilers and authors themselves. Here is an example of "New Theory of Artistic Creation" by Wang Chaowen, published by Xinhua Bookstore. More than 104 errors were found in this book, and the errata sheet at the end took up six pages. The author of the book said in the postscript: 'During the days when the publishing agency sent the proofs, it was the busiest time for other regular work, and the wish to revise it thoroughly during the proofreading process failed. ... There was no time to rewrite the few articles that I was most dissatisfied with during the proofreading process—the articles themselves were not presentable, or insufficient, or verbose, or the sentences were stiff, obscure, and the structure disorganized.' I think the author's attitude is too unserious, both towards his own works and towards the readers, no wonder this book has so many errors."

	Comrade Li Qing of the Preparatory Office of the Central Institute of Literature wrote: "When the researchers of this institute were studying Mr. Lu Xun's "The True Story of Ah Q," they used the book "On Ah Q" published by Gengyun Publishing House as a reference book. During the study, we found countless errors in the book. In the main text of "The True Story of Ah Q" attached at the end of the volume alone, according to preliminary statistics, there are 59 errors. There are even omissions of three or four words. Among them, some have greatly changed the original meaning due to the omission of words, and some have caused jokes due to typos. Take the first line of the 'Preface' as an example. The original text is: 'I have been wanting to write a biography for Ah Q for more than a year, but while writing, I also think back, which shows that I am not a person of "establishing words"...', this version actually made a mistake in the last sentence, changing the word 'I' to 'soul', becoming 'This shows that the soul is not a...' There are simply too many other similar situations and punctuation errors throughout the book. Such disregard for the works of the great Mr. Lu Xun is an extremely irresponsible attitude towards the people and readers. We hope that the person in charge of the publishing house will immediately make corrections and should ensure that similar incidents do not happen again in the future."

	Editor's Note: After receiving Comrade Li Qing's letter, we immediately sent the attached "Errata Sheet of The True Story of Ah Q" to Gengyun Publishing House. The publishing house replied that the book "On Ah Q" was purchased from the paper pattern of the Caoyuan Bookstore, and was published without correction. The book is now out of stock, and will be thoroughly corrected when it is reprinted.

### 读者之声

专栏：

　　读者之声
    汪华同志给我们来信，对上海大众书店版，许哲编著、吴应镐译的《朝鲜问题》提出意见，信上说：
    “这本书在翻译上完全表现了生吞活剥的情形。原作是一本时事书籍，译者对于时事的了解却显得异常生疏、模糊，例如书中竟把“联合国大会”译成“国联总会”，把“小型联大”译为“国联小总会”。在原书中的“联合国”，在译文中却成了“国联”。“葛罗米柯”译成了“克鲁墨克”，“塔斯社”成了“塔斯通讯”；“马立克”成为“马利克”；战争贩子杜勒斯，一译为“搭列斯”（七九页），二译为搭尔列士（八○页），三译为“德莱士”；臭名昭著的赖伊译成了“勒伊”。这已经是够荒唐的，译文中有很多用语简直是看不懂的，譬如“单政”，“单选”、“反托运动”，还有些什么“出荷”、“花招”、“野望”、“性体”，那简直是太不成话了！
    再举一个译文的例子看，书中第四页，引用一九四五年一月六日，邱吉尔致斯大林的信，文字是：
    “在西部因为进行着非常艰苦的战斗，所以由最高司令部则时常要求着重大决定，一时丧失了创造力以后，站于不得不防止广大战线的立场是多么感觉不安，我相信阁下对这问题根据自己的经验一定会知道的。俄国军队对于比利时战线或其附近一带，在一个月以内，再不然阁下认为适当的时期，是否能发动大攻击？我们是否能抱着一点指望？希望早日通知给我们，本人表示万分感谢……”（参照历史伪造者）
    这一段文字该怎样了解呢？我对照了新华书店版：“揭破历史捏造者”，译文是这样：
    “西战场战斗紧急，最高统帅部必须当机立断。阁下根据自己的经验，当深知要在主动权暂时失去之后来防守极辽阔的阵线，该是如何危急。…………盼望阁下预先通知一声，究竟我们能否指靠俄军于一月间在维斯拉河阵线或其他地方开始大规模的进攻，并盼望把阁下所愿告知的其他种种事项一并见示，…………务请火速赐复。”
    两相比较，明晦显然。这只能算是一例，而把维斯拉河阵线变成了比利时阵线，更是莫名其妙。其他不可解的地方太多了，不能一一例举。
    这一本书，就政治性来说，是很好的书；但因为译者的粗枝大叶，不负责任，结果却使它们成为读者所不能容忍的坏书。我希望出版者能将此书切实修订，重排出售。”                                 
    编者按：读者盛树人同志也有信来批评“朝鲜问题”，并提出和汪华同志同样的意见。

    林牧同志自西安给了我们这样一封信：
    “青年团西北工委宣传部，编印了一本《土地改革文献》在这本书中，由于粗枝大叶的作风，在校勘工作上表现出许多严重的错误，不但模糊了读者的观点，而且歪曲了我们整个政策。如书中把‘关于土地改革中一些问题的决定’第九条说明第二项‘对于积极参加反革命的游民领袖分子’一语，印成了‘对于积极参加革命的游民领袖分子’，把第十三条第二项内‘依原来成份不变更’一语，变成了‘依原来成份变更’。又如把陕西省马明方主席‘关于陕西省土地改革和一般工作任务的报告’一文中‘达到中立富农’一语，误为‘达到中立中农’，这都是极严重的错误。这是一本计一一六面的书，在再版时经勘出的错误计一二一处，正误表占了五页纸。计八月初版印了五千册，九月再版印了一万五千册。出版以后，许多读者纷纷提出意见，最后，工委决定把它停止发售了。现在剩余多少，还没有一个确实统计。编印《土地改革文献》，竟发生这许多严重性错误，这是工作草率，对读者不负责任。我反映这一件事，希望引起公私出版工作者的注意，因为停止发售事实上也是造成了人民财物的浪费。”

    张洛同志自无锡来信强调校对工作的重要，并主张建立校对工作者的负责制度——把书刊校对者姓名和编著者一样在版权页上加以著录。他的信中还提出另一个问题，说：
    “校对工作中的缺点，可能也有些与编著者本身有关。这里可以举出新华书店版、王朝闻著：《新艺术创作论》这一例子。这本书勘出的错误有一○四处之多，书末勘误表占去了六页。该书作者在后记中说：‘出版机关把校样送来的这几天，正是别的经常性的工作最繁忙的时候，编辑时打算在校对过程中好好修改一遍的愿望是落空了。……把校对过程中发现的几篇自己最不满意的文章——连文章本身都不像样的，或者不充分、或者噜嗦、或者文句生硬、晦涩，结构零乱的文章——改写，来不及。’我以为作者这样的态度不论是对自己的著作或是对读者，都是太不严肃的，难怪这本书有如许错误了。”

    中央文学研究所筹备处立青同志来信说：“本所研究员同志们在学习鲁迅先生的《阿Ｑ正传》的时候，曾用耕耘出版社出版的《论阿Ｑ》一书做为参考书。在学习当中，发现书中错误百出，仅仅卷末附录的《阿Ｑ正传》本文，据初步统计，即有五十九处错误。甚至有遗漏了三四个字的。其中有因漏字而大大的改变了原意的，更有因错字而造成了笑话的。就拿一开始‘序’的第一行来说吧，原文是：‘我要给阿Ｑ做正传，已经不止一年了，但一面要做，一面又往回想，这足见我不是一个‘立言’的人……’，这个版本竟把末句中的‘我’字错做‘魂’字，成了‘这足见魂不是一个……’。全书中其他类似情况及标点符号等错误简直不胜枚举。这样漠视伟大的鲁迅先生的作品，是对人民对读者极不负责的态度。希望该社负责人立即加以订正，并应保证以后不再发生类似事件。”                                                 
    编者按：我们得到立青同志的信后，跟即把所附来的“阿Ｑ正传正误表”寄给了耕耘出版社，该社来信说明《论阿Ｑ》一书系收买草原书店纸型，未加订正，即行出版。该书现已售缺，再版时当切实改正。
