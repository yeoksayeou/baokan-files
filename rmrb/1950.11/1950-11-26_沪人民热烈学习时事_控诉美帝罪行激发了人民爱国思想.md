Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 22nd—People from all walks of life in Shanghai have been widely engaged in current events study activities for the past half month. Various organizations, groups, factories, schools, and even business circles and neighborhood residents have held current events lecture meetings and forums to discuss current events issues. The content of wall newspapers, cartoon supplements, and radio stations all focuses on current events study. Many factories have also organized propaganda activists to help workers study current events. The Shanghai Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Against American Aggression organized a current events propaganda lecture group of more than 40 people, including Xia Yan, to give current events reports separately. The East China People's Broadcasting Station and the Shanghai People's Broadcasting Station jointly organized current events education lectures to cooperate with and assist people from all walks of life in studying current events.

The current events studies in various organizations, groups, factories, and schools in Shanghai are closely integrated with the current central tasks. For example, the units of the political and legal system of the East China Military and Political Committee focused on studying how to grasp the weapon of the people's democratic dictatorship and resolutely suppress the significance of all counter-revolutionary activities. Workers educated the masses with their personal experiences of being persecuted by American imperialists and Japanese invaders. Wu Xihe, a female worker at Yinfeng Woolen Mill, was a worker who produced well but had never cared about current affairs. After studying, she realized the ambition of American imperialism's aggression and its crazy and brutal characteristics, and decided to volunteer to go to the Korean front to participate in rescue work. Students from major middle schools used historical facts to accuse American imperialism of its crimes of invading our country for nearly a hundred years. More than 2,000 students from Fudan University went to various middle schools in the city to conduct current events propaganda. Many students in schools have requested to add military courses and automatically learn air defense knowledge. Neighborhood residents and housewives throughout the city have also generally held current events forums and casual talks. They compared their personal experiences of squeezing to buy rice and coal during the US-Chiang rule in Shanghai with the current stable prices and the vigorous municipal construction carried out by the People's Government, which aroused their love for the People's Government and hatred for American imperialism. Business circles and religious circles also held current events lecture meetings and forums to strengthen their understanding of the current situation.

Through this current events study, the people of all walks of life in Shanghai have greatly improved their political consciousness. They all demanded to take practical actions to resist US aggression and aid Korea to protect their homes and defend the country. Cadres, workers, and students of various organs expressed their determination to resist US aggression and aid Korea to protect their homes and defend the country by working hard, stepping up production, and studying hard. Neighborhood residents have automatically organized to assist the government in strengthening winter defense work. Zhou Zuowei, a special agent of the "Voice of America" who was lurking in the city to collect intelligence, manufacture and spread rumors, was arrested and protected based on citizen reports. Now the city's current events study is continuing to expand and deepen.

The experience of the people of Shanghai in studying current events is: (1) The current events study in factories, schools, and organs must be closely integrated with the current central work. (2) Organizing general meetings and reports must be combined with group discussions. After the masses have a preliminary understanding of the current situation, they should go deeper into solving various specific ideological problems. (3) Accusing American imperialism of its crimes of aggression and comparing it with the Japanese invaders is a good way to arouse people's patriotism. (4) In conducting current events propaganda among ordinary citizens, it is necessary to start with the facts at hand and with issues related to the vital interests of the masses.

　　沪人民热烈学习时事
    控诉美帝罪行激发了人民爱国思想
    【新华社上海二十二日电】上海市各界人民近半月来普遍展开了时事学习活动。各机关、团体、工厂、学校以及工商界、里弄居民等都纷纷召开时事讲演会、座谈会，讨论时事问题。各处墙报、漫画专刊和广播电台的内容，都以时事学习为中心。许多工厂里还组织了宣传鼓动员，帮助工人进行时事学习。中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会上海分会，组织了以夏衍等四十余人的时事宣传讲演团，分别作时事报告。华东人民广播电台和上海市人民广播电台联合举办了时事教育讲座，以配合和协助各界人民学习时事。
    上海市各机关团体、工厂、学校的时事学习，都密切结合了当前的中心工作。例如华东军政委员会政法系统的各单位，就着重学习如何掌握人民民主专政的武器，坚决镇压一切反革命活动的意义。工人们则以切身遭受美帝国主义者和日寇迫害的事实来教育群众。寅丰毛织厂女工吴锡荷，是一个生产很好但一向不关心时事的工人，在学习后认识了美帝国主义侵略的野心及其疯狂残暴的特性，决定志愿赴朝鲜前线参加救护工作。各大中学学生则用历史事实控诉了美帝国主义近百年来侵略我国的罪行。复旦大学二千余学生分赴市内各中学进行时事宣传。许多学校的学生已要求增设军事课程，并自动学习防空知识。全市的里弄居民和家庭妇女，也普遍地举行了时事座谈会和漫谈。他们从美蒋统治上海时挤购米、煤等亲身体验，和目前物价平稳、人民政府大力进行市政建设的情况相对比，激发了热爱人民政府和仇视美帝国主义的思想。工商界和宗教界也分别举行了时事讲演会和座谈会，加强了对目前局势的认识。
    上海市各界人民经过这次时事学习，大大地提高了政治觉悟。他们都要求以实际行动，抗美援朝保家卫国。各机关的干部、工人、学生都以努力工作、加紧生产和学习，表示抗美援朝保家卫国的决心。里弄居民都自动组织起来，协助政府加强冬防工作。潜伏在市内收集情报制造和散播谣言的“美国之音”特务情报员周祚卫，就是根据市民检举捕护的。现在全市的时事学习，正继续扩大和深入中。
    上海市人民学习时事的经验是：（一）工厂、学校、机关的时事学习，必须和当前中心工作密切结合。（二）组织大会报告必须和小组讨论相结合。在群众对当前时局有初步认识后，即应深入解决各种具体思想问题。（三）控诉美帝国主义侵略罪行和日寇对比，是激发人民爱国思想的好办法。（四）在一般市民中进行时事宣传，必须从眼前事实，从有关群众切身利益的问题谈起。
