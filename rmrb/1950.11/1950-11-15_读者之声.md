	Voices of the Readers
	Since this newspaper published Comrade Chen Boda's "On Version Issues" and the National Peking Library's "Some Opinions on Versions" on the 13th (published September 20th), it has attracted the attention of many readers, who have raised many opinions on the translation, editing, and proofreading of books and periodicals published by various publishers. This issue compiles and publishes a batch as follows:
	Comrade Fang Weizhong of Shenyang wrote to point out that in the Mass Bookstore edition, Li Ping's translation of "China's Economic Problems" (originally by Soviet author A. Astafiev), the translations of quotations from the Common Program did not follow the wording of the Common Program. For example, the original quotation of Article 28 of the Common Program, "the main material basis and the leading force of the entire social economy," was translated into "the leading force of the entire social economy" and "the main force of the completely socialist economy"; "various forms of labor mutual aid and production cooperation" was translated into "various forms of national mutual aid and production cooperation," and "under necessary and possible conditions" was translated into "to the extent possible and needed" (all on page 49). In addition, the Ministry of Forestry and Land Reclamation of the Central People's Government was translated as the "Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry," the Ministry of Food Industry was translated as the "Ministry of Grain Industry," and the Ministry of Finance supervising the People's Bank of China, and the Ministry of Trade managing customs were translated as "the Ministry of Finance supervising the People's Bank of China, the Ministry of Trade and Customs" (page 51), the Northeast Administrative Committee was translated as the "Northeast Takeover Committee" (page 36), and the worker-peasant alliance was translated as the "peasant-worker alliance" (page 47), all of which are significant errors.
	He suggested to comrades in the translation field: "It is hoped that when translating and describing original texts that cite domestic political, economic, and other systems and major events, especially those related to the wording of the Common Program, strict examination of laws and documents should be conducted, and they should be translated back according to the original text, and should not be carelessly fabricated."
	Shi Tuo and comrades Yang Bingxiang and Zhang Dezhao, in letters from Beijing and Ninghe respectively, all pointed out that the book "To Whom Does the Honor Belong?" published by Shanghai Lianyi Publishing House and edited by Bai Yan, contains many errors and is improperly arranged. Comrade Shi Tuo's letter said:
	"First of all, the table of contents of this book has a major error in arrangement. Although the focus of this book is Comrade Gao Gang's "To Whom Does the Honor Belong?", it is inappropriate to use Chairman Mao's articles as reference documents. Secondly, there is an article in the book called "Oppose Individualism." This article is an excerpt from the second point of Liu Shaoqi's "On the Self-Cultivation of a Communist" under the heading "Examples of Various Erroneous Ideological Consciousness within the Party." The editor casually added a title and arbitrarily deleted the text, which is even more wrong. Furthermore, the proofreading of this kind of documentary book for study is also very careless. There are misprints, omissions, inverted characters, and extra characters in almost every article, and errors in punctuation marks are even more numerous. Today, the broad masses of people urgently need to study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. It is naturally a gratifying thing that our publishing workers can publish these books in large quantities, but if the attitude towards publishing is not serious, and they are crudely made, or even arbitrarily cut apart documents and are irresponsible, it is harmful to the people. We suggest that Lianyi Publishing House automatically stop the printing of this book and hope that other publishers will pay attention to checking their own publications."
	Editor's note: This newspaper published an article written by Comrade Wang Xiaoren in the sixth issue entitled "Editing Documentary Works Should Be Serious." We would like to take this opportunity to reiterate this to all publishers.
	Comrade Wei Yi wrote to criticize the "Collection of Famous Soviet Songs - Katyusha" published by Sanlian Bookstore for its outdated materials, sloppy editing, and careless proofreading, and that it was "crudely made to cater to the urgent needs of the vast readership. It is hoped that Sanlian Bookstore and the editor of the book can conduct a review, seek remedies, and publish a decent "Selection of Soviet Songs" that truly lives up to its name."
	Sanlian Bookstore made the following reply to Comrade Wei Yi's criticism:
	"Upon investigation, the book "Katyusha" was published in Chongqing by Reading Publishing House before the Southern Anhui Incident, and was subsequently republished in Shanghai, and the first edition of Sanlian was printed after liberation. This book should not have been reprinted, but because we were not serious enough in our work, we did not check or carefully consider the impact. This kind of book was reprinted by the editor and Reading Publishing House as the third edition of Sanlian.
	We have now sought the opinions of Comrade Wei Yi and also sought the opinion of Comrade Li Ling, asking him to revise it for reference, and the book has also been suspended from sale.
	We are very grateful to Comrade Wei Yi for his love of the people's cause and for pointing out many mistakes to us. We hope that he can provide opinions regularly so that we can improve our work."
	Editor's note: The editor of this book, Comrade Li Ling, also wrote to explain that this book was published in Guilin in 1940, and Sanlian did not notify him when reprinting this book; afterwards, he "only made some corrections to the errors in the songs and put them away, and did not ask the bookstore to correct them, which was irresponsible to the readers." It is currently being re-proofread.
	Comrade Liu Mengqiu sent us a short article from Xinhua, Hunan: "Treatises and Translations," saying:
	"I have recently read two books: one is "Reader of Materialist Dialectics" (written by Sun Huairen, World Knowledge Series No. 16, published in January 1950); the other is "Popular Talk on Dialectics" (written by Tokunaga Nao, translated by Bao Gang, Shanghai Magazine Company, published in April 1947). Although these two books have different titles and are different in terms of 'written' and 'translated', the content is absolutely identical. There is not a single word of difference in terms of chapters and sections, and although there are some differences in wording, the meaning is the same. In terms of the order of publication, I hope that the World Knowledge Society will make an explanation and correct it in the reprint."
	Editor's note: The Shanghai Editorial Department of the World Knowledge Society has responded to this matter, explaining that "Reader of Materialist Dialectics" is a translation, "but the original work's many examples were changed to be closer to home." The letter further stated that the word "written" was added by them and they should be responsible for it. The book is currently being reprinted, and a detailed explanation and some corrections have been made, and the word "compiled and translated" has been used on the cover.

### 读者之声

第5版()
专栏：读者之声

　　读者之声
    自从本刊十三号上（九月二十日出版）发表了陈伯达同志“关于版本问题”和国立北京图书馆的“对版本的一些意见”后，引起了很多读者的注意，对各出版家出版的书刊译文、编辑和校勘上提了不少意见。本期汇集发表一批如次：
    沈阳房维中同志来信指出大众书店版、黎平译：《中国经济问题》（苏联阿斯塔也夫原著）书中原文引用共同纲领的地方，译文都没有照着共同纲领的文字译回。例如把原本引用共同纲领第二十八条“主要物质基础和整个社会经济的领导力量”译成“整个社会经济的领导力量”和“完全社会主义经济的主要力量”；把“各种形式的劳动互助和生产合作”译成“各种形式的国民互助和生产合作”，把“在必要和可能的条件下”译成“尽其可能与需要”（均见四九页）。此外还把中央人民政府的林垦部译成“农林”部，食品工业部译成“粮食工业”部，把财政部监督人民银行，贸易部管理海关译成“财政部监督人民银行、贸易部及海关”（五一页），把东北行政委员会译成“东北接管委员会”（三六页），把工农联盟译成“农工联盟”（四七页），都是很大的错误。
    他对翻译界同志们提出建议：“希望凡译述原文引证关于国内的政治、经济及其他制度与重大事件时，尤其有关共同纲领文字，要严格查考法令、文件，按照原文译回，不应粗枝大叶编造词句。”                                                   
    石拓及杨秉享、张德昭三同志，先后自北京及宁河来信都指出上海联益出版社出版、白雁编辑的：“荣誉是属于谁的”一书错误很多，编排上也不妥当。石拓同志的信上说：
    “首先，本书的目次编排上就有很大错误。固然本书的辑录中心是高岗同志的“荣誉是属于谁的”，但是，把毛主席的文章用来做参考文件是不合适的。其次，书中有一篇文章叫着“反对个人主义”。这篇文章是节录了刘少奇同志在“论党员修养”一书中关于“党内各种错误思想意识之举例”的第二点。编者却随便给加上一个标题，而且把文字也擅加删节，这更是不对的。再次，编印这种供学习用的文件性书籍，在校对上也非常不认真，错字、漏字、倒植字，多植字，几乎在每篇文章里都有，标点符号的错误更多。今天广大的人民是迫切地需要学习马列主义和毛泽东思想的，我们的出版工作者能够大量出版这些书自然是一件可喜的事，但是如果出版态度不严肃，而粗制滥造，甚至任意割裂文件，毫不负责的话，那是有害于人民的。我们建议联益出版社自动停止这本书的印行，并希望其他出版家注意检查自己的出版物。”                                            
    编者按：本刊第六期曾发表了王效仁同志所写的一篇“编辑文件性著作应认真”一文，我们愿意借此重复提请各位出版家的注意。                                                        
    韦以同志来信批评三联书店出版的“苏联名歌集——喀秋莎”材料陈旧，编辑草率，校勘疏忽，只是“为了投合广大读者的迫切需要，粗制滥造了出来。希望三联书店与该书编者能作一检查，谋加补救，另出一本像样的，真正名实相符的“苏联歌选”出来。”
    三联书店对韦以同志的批评，作了如下的答复：
    《查“喀秋莎”》一书系于皖南事变前由读书出版社在重庆出版，嗣又在沪再版，解放后又印行三联第一版。这本书本来已不可再印，因为我们对工作不够认真严肃，没有检查没有认真考虑影响如何。这种书编者和读书出版店再印三联第讨的。
    此书我们现在已征求韦以同志的意见也已征求李凌同志，请他参考修改，书亦已暂停出售。
    韦以同志这样的热爱人民事业，对我们指出了许多错误我们非常的感谢。希望他能够经常提供意见，以便改进我们的工作。”                                          
    编者按：本书编者李凌同志也曾来信说明本书是一九四○年在桂林出版，三联重版这本书时没有通知；事后他“只把歌曲错误的地方做了一些修正，放起来，没有要求书店更正，这是对读者不负责任的。”现已在重新校正。                                                              
    刘梦秋同志自湖南新化寄给了我们一篇短文：《论著与译》，说：
    “我近来读过两本书：一是‘唯物辩证法读本’（孙怀仁著，世界知识丛书之十六，一九五○年一月出版）；一是“通俗辩证法讲话”（德永直著、包刚译，上海杂志公司一九四七年四月出版）。这两本书尽管书名不同，而且有‘著’与‘译’不同，但内容是绝对相同的。在篇章节目上没有差异一个字，在文字上虽然有点差异，而意义则是一样的。按出版的先后言，我希望世界知识社有所说明，并在再版时加以纠正。”                                                    
    编者按：世界知识社上海社编辑部对此事曾作了答复，说明“唯物辩证法读本”是译本，“不过就近取譬，将原著许多例证改了一下。”来信更说明编著字样是他们给加上的，应该由他们负责。目前此书正在再版，对此事已作详细说明和若干修正，并在封面上改用“编译”字样。
