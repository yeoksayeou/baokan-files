[News from the Pyongyang Central News Agency Branch in China] A medical worker, Ju Xin, from Fujian Provincial Medical College, recently sent a letter to the medical workers of the Korean People's Army, donating money and books on the treatment of war injuries to support the Korean people's war of liberation. The letter reads in part: "Comrades of the Korean People's Army medical service: As I write this letter to you, my pulse is racing. I think, although we have different languages and scripts between China and Korea, we are both defending our motherland and safeguarding peace, standing on the side of peace and democracy led by the Soviet Union, resisting the aggression of the US imperialist bloc, and our goals are the same. Therefore, I am very excited to tell you what I want to say." The letter also stated: "I would like to join your battle to do first aid and treatment work for war injuries. I am willing to donate 200 CC of my own blood to your comrades who are wounded in defending the motherland and resisting US imperialist aggression. My blood type is O. This is my wish, and I hope to realize it in the future. But at present, I send you three things: I send you the 30,000 yuan in subsidies that my superiors gave me this month as my condolences to you. Furthermore, I am sending you a book on war injury treatment technology, the posthumous work of Dr. Bethune in the Chinese Anti-Japanese War, as a souvenir. I hope that all medical workers in Korea will learn from Dr. Bethune and successfully complete the war injury treatment work in the war of liberation of the motherland. In addition, there is a pistol bullet obtained in the Chinese People's Liberation War, which I give to you for self-defense and to strike the enemy."

The letter concluded: "Now all the teachers, students and staff of our Fujian Provincial Medical College are automatically and enthusiastically donating money to you to express their condolences to all Korean brothers. This is what I want to tell you in addition."
