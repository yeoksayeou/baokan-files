　　Xinhua News Agency, Paris, November 17th: According to TASS, the Central Committee of the French Communist Party has issued a strong protest against the attack on the plane of French Communist Party General Secretary Thorez by an American jet fighter. In the protest, the Central Committee of the French Communist Party expressed deep indignation at the fascist methods adopted by American imperialism in the skies over West Frankfurt, extended heartfelt thanks to the Soviet pilot who foiled the assassination plot, and denounced American imperialism, assisted by the slavish French government, for still attempting to transplant these fascist methods to France. The Central Committee of the French Communist Party pointed out: "The American imperialists decided to murder Thorez because Thorez was the first to expose the dangerous consequences of American interference in French internal affairs, and because Thorez was the first to explain that the aim of the American imperialists is to colonize France and prepare for a war against the Soviet Union."
　　L'Humanité wrote in an article on the 16th that the shameless conspiracy to murder Thorez was instigated by "the same center that ordered the murders of Duclos in France, Togliatti in Italy, Tokuda Kyuichi in Japan, and also ordered the murder of Lahaut in Belgium."

    痛斥其卑鄙的法西斯手段
    【新华社十八日讯】据塔斯社巴黎十七日讯：法国共产党中央委员会顷对美国喷气战斗机袭击法共总书记多列士座机一事发出强烈抗议，法共中央委员会在抗议书中对美帝国主义在法兰克福西方上空采取的这种法西斯手段表示深切愤慨，向挫败了杀害阴谋的苏联驾驶员表示衷心感谢，并痛斥美帝国主义在奴隶成性的法国政府协助下，还在想把这种法西斯手段移植到法国去。法共中央委员会指出：“美国帝国主义者决定谋害多列士，是因为多列士第一个揭露了美国干涉法国内政的危险后果，是因为多列士第一个说明了美帝国主义者的目的在使法国殖民地化和准备反苏战争。”
    人道报于十六日撰论指出：谋杀多列士的无耻阴谋，是由“曾经下令谋杀法国的杜克洛、意大利的托里亚蒂、日本的德田球一，而且下令杀害了比利时的拉豪特的同一个中心”主使的。
