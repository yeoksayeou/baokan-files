　　Studying "Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism" to Understand American Imperialism Fundamentally
    Wang Huide
    (I)
    Lenin's book "Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism" was written in the spring of 1916. At that time, industrial capitalism had just completed its transformation into imperialism worldwide. But even then, Lenin had already raised all the fundamental issues contained in imperialism in this book. He pointed out that imperialism is monopoly capitalism, parasitic and decadent capitalism, and dying capitalism. He explained that monopoly replacing free competition is the fundamental economic feature of imperialism and its essence. This monopoly is manifested in: First, the high concentration of production and capital, leading to the formation of capitalist monopoly alliances such as cartels, syndicates, and trusts. Second, the merger of huge banking capital with industrial capital to form financial capital, with a few huge financial oligarchs controlling the largest part of the national monetary capital, means of production, raw materials, and other wealth, and dominating the entire social and economic life. Third, capital export has particularly important significance, with the majority of nations and countries worldwide becoming debtors and tribute payers to a few financial oligarchs, and foreign investment and loans becoming a solid foundation for imperialist powers to oppress and exploit the majority of nations and countries worldwide. Fourth, international capitalist monopoly alliances divide the world's economic sphere, and they engage in sharp struggles for raw materials, markets, investment sites, and high super-profits. Fifth, the territorial division of the world has been completed, imperialist powers implement the most brutal national oppression against colonies and semi-colonies, and many other so-called independent large and small countries become dependent states of a few imperialist powers. They are independent in appearance, but in finance, economy, and diplomacy, they are dependent on imperialist powers everywhere. Lenin explained that imperialism is parasitic and decadent capitalism. This is primarily manifested in the fact that any monopoly under the private ownership of means of production has a stagnant and corrupting effect on technological progress and all other progress. Second, the formation of a large rentier class divorced from production. Third, due to capital export, the rentier class in imperialist countries becomes parasites on the hundreds of millions of workers worldwide. Fourth, financial capital inevitably tends to dominate, oppose freedom, and move towards comprehensive political reaction. Fifth, a few imperialist countries become rentier states, countries that live by exploiting other countries and nations. Lenin pointed out the historical position of imperialism. He said that imperialism is dying capitalism because capitalism has become excessively mature. The monopoly growing out of capitalism already indicates that capitalism is dying, and that the time for it to be replaced by socialism has matured. The highly socialized production reached at the stage of imperialism has made the private ownership of means of production an intolerable shell incompatible with the content, and it must be shattered. At the same time, Lenin explained that imperialism has made all the contradictions of bourgeois society reach unprecedented sharpness. The sharpening of these contradictions inevitably leads to the most profound revolutionary crisis in the world, and the result is to push capitalism towards collapse. Therefore, Lenin pointed out that imperialism is the eve of the proletarian socialist revolution.

    As everyone knows, Lenin's book was prepared for public publication under the Tsarist system. To address the concerns of the Tsarist government's censors, there were many issues that could not be discussed freely. But in this book and other articles he wrote at the same time, Lenin emphasized that the rule of financial capital and monopoly strengthened the uneven development of capitalism, and the result inevitably led to the deepening and sharpening of conflicts within the imperialist camp, inevitably leading imperialism towards armed conflicts and wars, and inevitably weakening the world capitalist front. All these conditions created the possibility for the proletariat of individual countries to break through the imperialist front and the possibility of socialism winning victory first in a few or a single capitalist country.

    The above are the immortal truths that Lenin told us in his book "Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism".

    (II)

    Lenin's book is most valuable to us because it gives us a powerful ideological weapon, enabling us to fundamentally understand our enemy—American imperialism.

    William Z. Foster, chairman of the Communist Party of the United States, pointed out in his book "The Downfall of World Capitalism": "One of the greatest illusions from which vast numbers of Americans suffer is their failure to realize that the United States is an imperialist country—in fact, the most aggressively imperialist country in the world. This country bears all the characteristics of the age of capitalism as analyzed by the great Lenin."

    In fact, in China, there are also many people who have suffered greatly because they failed to understand that the United States is an imperialist country. For example, some people have imagined: "The United States is a liberal country."

    Whether the United States is a liberal country or an imperialist country, we might as well start by analyzing this question.

    The development of American capitalism did indeed go through a stage of free competition, and many so-called democracy and freedom tunes sung during this stage by the bourgeoisie did intoxicate many people. However, in the United States, this stage has long passed, and capitalist free competition has long been replaced by capitalist monopoly. In "Imperialism," Lenin, based on materials from forty years ago, that is, from 1909, already pointed out the monopoly tendency in American production. He said that in 1909, enterprises in the United States with a production value of more than one million US dollars concentrated 30.5% of the country's workers and produced 43.8% of the country's industrial products. Lenin concluded from this material: "From this, it can be seen that when the concentration of production develops to a considerable degree, it can be said that it naturally leads to monopoly." Forty years have passed from 1909 to the present, and the history of American production in these forty years has further proved Lenin's assertion. In 1939, American enterprises with more than one million US dollars had concentrated 55% of the country's workers and produced 67.5% of the country's industrial products. By 1944, which was the period when World War II was about to end, three-quarters of the US military orders were concentrated in the hands of the 100 largest monopoly enterprises, and 30 super-large monopoly enterprises alone accounted for one-half of the national military orders. The monopoly of American industrial production has reached such a degree: the production of pure aluminum nationwide is entirely controlled by one company, 83% of the country's copper mines are controlled by six major companies, 88% of the country's steel is produced by ten large steel enterprises, 86% of the country's automobiles are produced by three companies, half of the country's agricultural machinery is produced by a company called International Harvester Company, 65% of the country's chemical fertilizer production is controlled by seven companies, and 70% of the country's meat processing industry is concentrated in four companies.

    Of course, today's monopoly in the United States is capitalist monopoly, so this monopoly does not eliminate competition. However, this competition is no longer the free competition of "equal opportunities for all the people (capitalists)", but only the infighting and conflict between a few monopolists. As for the relationship between monopolists and non-monopolists, it is less free competition and more annexation. For example, in 1949 alone, 480,000 independent enterprises in the United States were eliminated by monopolists. Lenin said in "Imperialism": "Now it is no longer a competition between large and small enterprises, a competition between technologically backward enterprises and technologically advanced enterprises. Now, it is already monopolists strangling those enterprises that do not yield to the monopoly, do not yield to the oppression and will of the monopolists."

    From the perspective of the entire field of economic life, the biggest characteristic of American imperialism is that a small number of financial oligarchs control the largest part of the monetary capital and means of production in the United States, and dominate the entire social and economic life of the United States. In the United States, there are eight all-encompassing financial oligarchs, namely the five families of Morgan, Rockefeller, Mellon, DuPont, and Kuhn Loeb, and three local banking groups, namely the Chicago Banking Group, the Cleveland Banking Group, and the Boston Banking Group. In the United States, there are 200 of the largest companies, and these eight major financial oligarchs control 175 of them. Morgan alone controls 41 companies. Morgan concentrates almost one-third of the entire U.S. industrial production, two-thirds of steel production, one-quarter of the length of railroads, and five major banks in his hands. Others, such as Kuhn Loeb, own 13 railroads, Rockefeller owns more than half of the country's oil production, and DuPont and Morgan almost control 80% of the country's explosives production. The development of these monopoly capitals in the United States is very fast. Lenin said in "Imperialism" that at that time Morgan and Rockefeller jointly owned 11 billion marks, or 2.5 billion US dollars, of capital. After decades of development, the capital of these two largest financial oligarchs has now increased to 52 billion US dollars (some say it has reached 94 billion US dollars), which means it has increased dozens of times.

    Lenin once pointed out that one of the important characteristics of imperialism is that capital export has important significance. It makes other nations and countries debtors and tribute payers of a few financial oligarchs. These capital exports, carried out in the form of direct investment or loans, become a solid foundation for a few financial oligarchs to oppress, bind, and enslave the majority of nations and countries around the world. If we talk about the United States, capital export is particularly important to the development of U.S. imperialism. Because U.S. imperialism developed later than other imperialisms, when it stepped onto the world stage of imperialism, most of the undeveloped countries in the world had already been divided by other imperialist countries. Therefore, it focused on economic penetration, using capital export to infiltrate other countries. In particular, the two world wars made U.S. imperialism rich, while other capitalist countries encountered great difficulties due to the destruction of the wars. This gave U.S. imperialism the possibility to use capital export as a means to threaten and control other capitalist countries, seize their political, economic, and military sovereignty, and usurp their colonies in order to establish its own world hegemony. This situation was particularly prominent after World War II. In 1945, the total amount of capital exported by the United States was 17.3 billion US dollars, but by 1948, it had increased to 34.8 billion US dollars. The current situation is that U.S. imperialism has become the center of financial capital export in the capitalist world. The countries and nations of the capitalist world have mostly become debtors and tribute payers of a few financial oligarchs in U.S. imperialism. The US dollar has become a weapon for U.S. imperialism to control the entire capitalist world. All capital exports under the names of "Marshall Plan," "European Recovery Program," "US Aid," "Point Four Program," etc., have become the material basis for U.S. imperialism to oppress, bind, and enslave the majority of nations and countries in the capitalist world. Massive capital export has established a monopoly system for U.S. imperialism to exploit and enslave the entire capitalist world.

    When World War II had just ended, in 1946, U.S. imperialism used the pressure of a 3.75 billion US dollar loan to Great Britain to force Great Britain to lose its protection system in currency, exchange rates, import and export trade, causing British ministers like Amery to complain that "America regards the British Empire as an oyster and wants to use this loan to force the oyster to open its shell. Every part of the British Empire, if it loses the protection of imperial preference, will be eaten by the United States one by one, will become the object of American industrial exploitation, will become a tribute-paying country of American financial groups, and finally will become a territory of the United States." The U.S. imperialism's loan to France in 1947 gave it some rights to implement political intervention and economic supervision in France. The Marshall Plan, which started in 1948, gave U.S. imperialism the West German arms monopoly enterprises, and the right to supervise or decide on industrial construction, financial plans, import tariffs, export trade, and raw material supply of the other sixteen Western European countries. U.S. imperialism further used the Marshall Plan as a means of coercion to make the Marshallized countries participating in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization lose their political and military sovereignty. Due to the U.S. imperialism's capital exports in various forms, Western European countries became vassals and even colonies of U.S. imperialism, becoming a market flooded with American goods and American munitions. Under the blow of commodity dumping, the economies of Western European countries collapsed rapidly, a large number of factories closed down, and workers became unemployed. U.S. imperialism's assistance of 6 billion US dollars to the Chiang Kai-shek group is another example, and it was paid for at the cost of the entire national sovereignty of our China. It was due to the victory of our people's struggle that our motherland was freed from the enslavement of U.S. imperialism, and U.S. imperialism's plan of aggression against China was bankrupted.

    In short, judging from the various situations we have described above, the United States today is not a "liberalism" country, but a complete imperialist country, and an imperialist country that has established a monopoly system of exploitation and enslavement of the entire capitalist world. Lenin said in the preface to the French and German editions of "Imperialism": "Private ownership, free competition, democracy—all these slogans originally used by capitalists and their newspapers to deceive workers and peasants, have long become things of the past. Capitalism has become a worldwide system in which a very small number of 'advanced' countries oppress the vast majority of the world's population with colonial policies and financially control them with financial capital." This statement is very appropriate for the United States today.

    (III)

    The monopoly of the United States in the economic field, reflected in politics, is the dictatorship of the smallest number of financial oligarchs, the direct combination of monopoly capital giants and state institutions, and the fascization of the state.

    Today's state power in the United States is not a "democratic" regime. It is actually controlled by an organization called the "National Association of Manufacturers." What is this National Association of Manufacturers? It is a joint organization of large capitalists in the United States. It owns 16,000 enterprises with huge capital and controls 60 billion US dollars of capital. Its leading organ, the so-called "Committee of Twelve," is composed of representatives of several financial oligarchy groups in the United States, such as Morgan, Rockefeller, Mellon, and DuPont. The major domestic and foreign policies of the American government agencies are finally determined by this leading organ of the financial oligarchs. The association's own published pamphlets also say: The leading organ of the National Association of Manufacturers "maintains daily contact with the leaders of Congress and the leaders of various departments and bureaus, collects information for its members, and informs the relevant administrative agencies (i.e., the American government agencies) of the views of the industrial groups on current issues."

    The financial oligarchs not only actually concentrate the state power of the United States in their hands, but also directly combine the giants or agents of monopoly capital with state institutions. The leading figures of the US government, such as Secretary of State Acheson, Chairman of the National Security Resources Board Symington, Truman's special assistant advisor Harriman, Dulles, the State Department's foreign policy advisor responsible for negotiations with Japan, Austin, the US Permanent Representative to the United Nations, McCloy, the US High Commissioner to West Germany, Johnson, the former US Secretary of Defense, etc., were all sent to the Truman government by the National Association of Manufacturers. Acheson is a consultant to "DuPont, Rockefeller Ethylene Company" and the owner of the law firm "Covington, Darlinglo, Acheson Company." Symington was the manager of "Emerson Electric Company" during World War II. Harriman is one of the richest people in the United States and the manager of "Brown Brothers, Harriman Banking Company." McCloy is a consultant to Rockefeller's "Chase Bank." Johnson is the manager of "United Aircraft Manufacturing Company." In early 1948, Truman appointed nearly 50 bank bosses and large capitalists to leading positions in the American government.

    The characteristic of the dictatorship of the American financial oligarchs today is that it has embarked on the most reactionary, barbaric, and brutal road, which is the road to fascism. Foster pointed out in "The Downfall of World Capitalism" that American monopoly capitalists "control the government and all other important institutions, and they use them for their own purposes. These dominant monopoly capitalists are basically undemocratic and even fascist. In the United States, as elsewhere, imperialism has reached the stage of fascism."

    In fact, the United States has now completely become a police state. American monopoly capitalists have increasingly relied on a huge espionage system to rule and suppress the people. The Federal Bureau of Investigation of the US Department of Justice is a large-scale espionage agency. In 1946, it had 14,300 professional spies, as well as more part-time spies, called "Friends of the FBI." These spies are taught various techniques of reconnaissance, tracking, and assassination. In 1947, according to Truman's order, they conducted reconnaissance and interrogation of 2 million civil servants and 100,000 atomic energy workers, made detailed records of the lifestyle, political views, and relationship of friends of each of these millions of people, and forced these people to take "loyalty" oaths. They conduct secret registration of American progressives, called "National Security Index," and hundreds of thousands of Americans are included in this blacklist every year. The so-called "National Security" law they formulated stipulates that members of the Communist Party and other democratic groups must register with the police agencies, implement the strictest police surveillance system, and stipulate that once the president declares a "state of emergency," the so-called "saboteurs" will be arrested in large numbers and imprisoned in concentration camps without trial. This decree controls about 550,000 people. In addition, as of December 1, 1949, the Federal Bureau of Investigation had registered 113 million Americans' fingerprints, a figure that exceeds three-quarters of the total American population, which means that almost every American is secretly recorded by the secret police as a potential criminal. Paul Kahn, chairman of the New York City Civil Service Commission, said: "The Federal Bureau of Investigation has spies everywhere and has begun to maintain a huge police file recording the activities of all American people." Today, there is no country in the world with as many spies as the United States, and no people in any country are as universally subject to reconnaissance and surveillance as in the United States. The United States has become a major base of fascist reaction.

    It can be seen from the above explanation that the United States today is not only an ordinary imperialist country, but also an imperialist country that has developed into the most reactionary, barbaric, and autocratic country. As Lenin said in "Imperialism": "Imperialism is the era of financial capital and monopoly, and financial capital and monopoly spread the trend of domination everywhere, not the trend of freedom. The result of this trend of domination is the overall reaction under all political systems, and the contradictions in political systems are also extremely sharp."

    (IV)

    Saying that American imperialism is the most reactionary, barbaric, and autocratic does not include all of its characteristics. Its most important characteristic is its aggressiveness. American imperialism is the most aggressive imperialism in the world today.

    This is primarily because American imperialism has grown up relying on war and has grown rich and fat in the blood of the people of various countries, especially in Europe and Asia. American imperialists are the people in the world who are most "accustomed to seizing wealth from the blood of millions of people and from the tears of mothers and sons."

    When World War I broke out in 1914, the United States was in an economic depression. This war helped the United States through the depression and brought it a period of unprecedentedly active production and industrial development. A large number of military orders, loans to belligerent countries, and huge amounts of commodity exports nurtured the growth of the economic power of American imperialism. This war enabled American imperialism to earn more profits than any other imperialism. Regarding American imperialism at this time, Lenin once said in "Letter to American Workers": "They have turned everything, even the richest countries, into their tribute payers. They have plundered hundreds of billions of dollars... Every dollar is condensed with bloodstains, which are stained in the blood sea formed by ten million dead and twenty million wounded..."

    As for World War II, it made American imperialism even richer. In this war, U.S. imperialist enterprises earned a total of $87 billion in profits, and various monopoly capital organizations obtained a net profit of $53 billion. Individual companies in the war years—1942—earned more than 100 times the average profit of pre-war years. The blood of millions of people has once again turned into gold coins, flowing into the pockets of the U.S. imperialist financial oligarchs.

    American imperialism, which grew up in the blood of war, has formed a swollen and bloated industrial structure. This structure can only maintain its high profits, and even maintain its life, by relying on the constant injection of war blood. The two world wars have enabled the industrial production of the United States to obtain extreme expansion, especially the expansion of the arms industry and the steel, oil, coal, motorcycle, and machinery manufacturing industries closely combined with it. These expanded industries have been completely unable to complete their capital circulation through normal channels, and if this circulation stops, not only will the high profits turn into nothing, but a fierce economic crisis will immediately come. Therefore, it can only maintain its life by relying on constant military orders. Foster said in his book "The Downfall of World Capitalism": "The situation of American capitalism has become a serious danger not only to the American people, but also to the whole world. Because American capitalism, which has swelled from drinking the blood of war, has developed its appetite to an extremely dangerous degree. The productivity of American industry, relying on its artificial war nourishment, has increased factory productivity by $25 billion in the war (more than the entire pre-war industrial productivity of Germany). It has now become so large that it can no longer sell its piles of goods in the domestic and world markets through normal trade channels... They propose to mainly fill the economic gap between production and consumption by establishing a huge war economy, and this war economy will feed American industry with 20 billion or 40 billion US dollars of military orders every year. In fact, this is what they are doing now."

    It is because of the above reasons that after the end of World War II, U.S. imperialism has been clamoring for war, creating various tensions, launching the war of aggression against Korea, and attempting to provoke a new war in order to use this situation to maintain its military production.

    U.S. imperialism's policy of pursuing war has maintained the high profits of American monopoly capitalists and increased these profits. For example, the total profit of American monopoly capitalists in 1947 was 18 billion US dollars, and in 1948, it increased to 21 billion US dollars. Not long ago, the US National Armaments Committee convened a meeting of US large industrial capitalists. At the meeting, Howard explained the necessity of war for American economic undertakings, and announced that in the first six months of "extraordinary circumstances," the three departments of the Army, Navy, and Air Force would give American industrial circles 41 billion US dollars in orders. This announcement aroused the great satisfaction of the big capitalists present. After U.S. imperialism launched a war in Korea, an American magazine, "Newsweek," recorded that "Since the shooting began, the oil company's index has improved a few points," "Railways have also profited from the intensification of the military," and so on.

    U.S. imperialism is the most aggressive imperialism in the world today because it attempts to save its own demise by conquering the world. Although U.S. imperialism has increasingly established its economic operation on the exploitation of a considerable part of the countries and peoples of the world, this has not relieved its own crisis. This situation forces it to intensify its expansion to the world, hoping to maintain its own corrupt and parasitic economic system by dominating the world and exploiting and enslaving the entire world.

    We already know that during World War II, the economic strength of U.S. imperialism reached its peak. If the index of US industrial production in 1937 was 100, the highest number in 1943 had increased to 212, which means it had doubled. After the end of World War II, this growing economic power encountered a shrinking domestic market. The purchasing power in the United States was fundamentally unable to make the growing monopoly economy of U.S. imperialism operate normally. It could not accommodate the large number of accumulated commodities, nor could it accommodate the capital that had increased greatly in the war. The method of U.S. imperialism to get rid of this crisis, in addition to maintaining military production, is to expand abroad as much as possible.

    This expansion of U.S. imperialism to foreign countries has been going on for a long time. The situation of the capitalist world formed after World War II has extremely strengthened this expansion. Due to World War II, three of the five imperialisms that were in conflict with U.S. imperialism on the international stage (Germany, Japan, and Italy) were defeated, and the other two (Britain and France) were greatly weakened. Only U.S. imperialism, due to its naturally advantageous strategic position, not only did not suffer damage, but developed particularly. U.S. imperialism used this situation to strengthen its plunder of the entire capitalist world. In Western Europe, it used the "Marshall Plan" and "loans" to obtain financial and economic control over the capitalist countries of Britain, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Switzerland, Sweden, Portugal, Norway, and Denmark to varying degrees, strengthened its capital exports to them, and made American goods flood these countries. It also obtained the sales of American military goods to these participating countries through methods such as the "North Atlantic Treaty." For the three defeated fascist countries: in West Germany, it bought various enterprises in large quantities and penetrated into some enterprises with investment. It seized 200 tons of gold from Germany, transported away rare metal raw materials and their refining factories that the United States did not have, stole nearly 200,000 patent rights, and carried out exclusive activities in the most important Ruhr industrial zone in West Germany. In Japan, it invested heavily in a series of enterprises of the four major financial oligarchs, Mitsui, Mitsubishi, Sumitomo, and Yasuda, and completely combined with them. At the same time, it also conducted a large number of loans and commodity dumping in Japan. In Italy, the "Marshall Plan" forced Italy to abandon the steel, paper, machinery, motorcycle, chemical and other industries, and replaced them with the production of canned food, beer, etc. American survey groups are all over Italy. Italy's financial and economic sovereignty is actually in the hands of U.S. imperialism. In Spain, it invested heavily in aviation, transportation construction, railways, rubber, oil and other economic undertakings, and made a large number of loans to Spain. In Greece, it obtained all financial and economic sovereignty. It bought the Flachia lead mine in Greece, bought the stocks of major enterprises, and turned Greece into its raw material supply base and commodity dumping market. In Turkey, it sold a large number of military goods and made a large number of loans to Turkey. It also obtained the oil exploration rights in the Kamanda and Adana districts, as well as the development rights of other minerals. In the Far East: In Indonesia, it owns millions of acres of rubber plantations and more than 500 oil wells. Its investment in this colonial territory accounts for four-fifths of its total foreign investment. In South Korea, it obtained control of all financial and economic affairs and turned South Korea into a monopoly market for American goods. As for the Philippines, this has long been a colony of the United States, and it is still its colony in reality. In addition, it intervened in the British colony of India and the French colony of Vietnam, making these places its investment sites and commodity markets. In the Near East countries such as Iran, Iraq, and Arabia, where oil production accounts for 45% of the world's output, the United States took advantage of the weakening of Britain and France after World War II to try its best to seize the oil exploitation rights there. In total, its oil investment in the Near East accounts for more than 41% of the total investment in the region. In Africa: In Egypt, it obtained oil exploration rights and made a large number of loans to Egypt. As for Liberia, this is completely its colony and is its supplier of rubber, gold mines, and other minerals. It is also actively extending its influence to other imperialist colonies in Africa. For example, it exports a large number of commodities to the British South African Federation and invests in the Transvaal gold mines. It obtained the uranium mines and other minerals in the Belgian Congo. As for the Americas, this is completely its exclusive raw material market, sales market, and investment market. The British colony of Canada has also completely become its vassal and is economically controlled by it.

    From the above situation, it seems that the U.S. imperialism today has actually turned all countries and nations in the capitalist world into its affiliated countries, semi-colonies, and colonies, and has established a monopoly system of exploitation and enslavement of the entire capitalist world; and this also means that it has parasitized its economy on the exploitation of a considerable part of the countries and peoples of the world. As Foster said: "American capitalism is like a huge parasite, living off the rest of world capitalism; it devours other capitalist countries like cannibals and relies on their living materials to enrich itself."

    However, the corruption of U.S. imperialism has reached such a degree that even the establishment of an exploitation system of the entire capitalist world still cannot solve its own crisis. Despite its vigorous expansion to the entire capitalist world after World War II, its commodity export figures have been declining year by year. In 1947, the total value of commodities exported by U.S. imperialism was 15.3 billion US dollars. In 1948, it dropped to 12.6 billion US dollars, and in 1949, it dropped to 12.3 billion US dollars. In 1950, according to the figures for the first quarter, it only reached 9.5 billion US dollars. This figure very clearly reflects a situation in which the foreign market is shrinking day by day. In 1948 and 1949, despite the Marshall Plan export goods accounting for one-third of the total exports, it did not prevent this downward trend.

    The result of the shrinking foreign and domestic markets is the hoarding of goods. If the commodity inventory of 1935-1939 is taken as the base number 100, the index in 1945 was 166, in 1946 it was 213, and in 1947 it was 255. At the beginning of 1947, the US commodity inventory reached 35 billion US dollars, and by the end of 1947, it increased to 50 billion US dollars. In 1948, it further increased to 58.6 billion US dollars.

    The increase in commodity inventory means that capital is being suppressed, capital circulation is being interrupted, and capital is losing its exploiting vitality. The inevitable result of this situation is the contraction of production. The US industrial production index reached its peak in 1943, which was 212. After that, the general trend was a gradual decline. It was 180 in 1945, 150 in 1946, 165 in 1947, 170 in 1948, 165 in January 1949, and 157 in January 1950.

    The reduction in commodity exports, the increase in commodity inventory, and the decline in production—this means that a new economic crisis is already knocking on the door of US imperialism.

    Under this circumstance, U.S. imperialism attempts to solve its own crisis by intensifying its aggression against other countries and nations. It attempts to maintain its own corrupt and parasitic economic system and save its dying fate by enslaving and exploiting the entire world. This point is the fundamental reason why US imperialism is the most aggressive imperialism in the world today.

    Chairman Mao said in his article "The Current Situation and Our Tasks": "The economic strength of U.S. imperialism, which was enhanced during World War II, is encountering an unstable, shrinking domestic market and international market. The further shrinking of this market will lead to the outbreak of an economic crisis. The war boom in the United States is only a temporary phenomenon. Its power is only superficial and temporary. The crisis is like a volcano, threatening U.S. imperialism every day. U.S. imperialism is sitting on this volcano. This situation has forced the US imperialist elements to establish a plan to enslave the world. Like beasts, they are running around in Europe, Asia, and other places, gathering the reactionary forces of various countries, the dregs that have been spurned by the people, forming an imperialist and anti-democratic camp, opposing all democratic forces headed by the Soviet Union, preparing for war, and attempting to launch a third world war in the future, in the distant time, to defeat the democratic forces. This is a arrogant plan. The democratic forces of the world must defeat this plan and are fully capable of defeating it."

    Now, let us conclude the analysis of American imperialism.

    When Lenin discussed the historical position of imperialism in "Imperialism," he said that imperialism is dying capitalism. This means that in the imperialist stage, capitalism has reached the edge of its death.

    Throughout the world, capitalism has experienced its youthful, upward-developing period. During this period, human society made a big step forward, and the industrial revolution that accompanied capitalism increased the productivity of society many times over. However, when it entered the imperialist stage, it turned to a declining, downward period. At this time, it not only could not bring any progress to mankind, but strongly hindered the continued development of mankind everywhere. Only by eliminating imperialism with the proletarian socialist revolution can human beings continue to move forward. Lenin said in his article "Opportunism and the Collapse of the Second International": "The era of capitalist imperialism is the era when capitalism has matured and become excessively mature, at which time capitalism is on the eve of its own collapse and has matured to the point of giving way to socialism."

    Capitalism giving way to socialism—this is the task that human social development is to complete in the imperialist period.

    The October Revolution of 1917 solved this task for the first time. Due to the victory of the October Revolution, capitalist rule collapsed on one-sixth of the world's surface. Tsarist Russian imperialism, one of the world's most important imperialist countries at that time, was pushed off the historical stage. The first socialist country in the world, the Soviet Union, appeared. From then on, a new era has been unfolded before all mankind, that is, the era of the rise of socialism and its final complete victory in the world and the decline of capitalism and its final complete elimination in the world.

    The victory of the October Revolution shocked the capitalist world. They attempted to salvage this first demise of imperialism. In 1918, 14 imperialist countries including the United States, Britain, and Japan launched an encirclement and suppression of the Soviet Union. At that time, the bourgeoisie of the entire world asserted that socialism was about to perish. However, the result of the three-year war was not the perishing of socialism, but its victory and the failure of imperialism. After that, until World War II, on the one hand, there was the victory of socialist construction in the Soviet Union, and on the other hand, there was the crisis and the sharpening of internal contradictions in the capitalist countries.

    During World War II, in 1941, the Soviet-German war broke out. The invasion of the Soviet Union by German fascism was actually the result of the entire capitalist world supporting and condoning Germany for a long time, attempting to turn Germany into an anti-Soviet sentinel, although this policy also caused the imperialist countries of Britain and France to suffer themselves.

    World War II ended with the victory of socialist Soviet Union and the failure of imperialist fascist Germany, Japan, and Italy. The result of this war, on the one hand, was the further strengthening of the socialist Soviet Union, the emergence of a whole group of countries in Southeast Europe moving towards socialism, the establishment of the great new democratic New China, and the liberation of more than 600 million people from the enslavement of the capitalist world and entering the socialist peaceful democratic camp headed by the Soviet Union; on the other hand, it was the unprecedented weakening of the entire capitalist world. Three of the six largest imperialist countries (Germany, Japan, and Italy) were defeated, and two (Britain and France) were greatly weakened, leaving only the last major imperialism, the United States, in the world.

    In this way, a new situation has emerged in the world, that is, the strength of the socialist

　　学习《帝国主义论》从根本上认识美帝国主义
    王惠德
    （一）
    列宁的《帝国主义是资本主义的最高阶段》（即《帝国主义论》）一书，是在一九一六年春写成的，这时在世界范围内，产业资本主义刚完成了向帝国主义的转变，但在这个时候，列宁在这一本书中就已经把帝国主义所包含的各种根本问题，都提出来了。他指出：帝国主义是垄断的资本主义，是寄生的、腐朽的资本主义，是垂死的资本主义。他说明，垄断代替自由竞争，是帝国主义的根本的经济特征，是帝国主义的本质。这个垄断，表现在：一、生产和资本高度集中起来，以致形成卡德尔、新迪加、托拉斯这样的资本家垄断联盟。二、巨大的银行资本与工业资本溶合成为财政资本，少数巨大的财政寡头支配着全国最大部分货币资本，生产工具、原料和其他财富，支配着全部社会经济生活。三、资本输出具有特别重要的意义，全世界大多数民族和国家成了少数财政寡头的债务人和纳贡者，向国外的投资和贷款成了帝国主义列强压迫剥削全世界大多数民族和国家的坚实基础。四、资本家的国际垄断同盟分割了世界的经济领域，它们为了原料，为了市场，为了投资场所，为了丰厚的超额利润进行尖锐的斗争。五、在领土上分割世界已经完结，帝国主义列强对于殖民地半殖民地实行最残酷的民族压迫，其他许多所谓独立的大小国家变成少数帝国主义列强的依赖国，他们在表面上是独立的，而在财政经济和外交上则处处依赖帝国主义列强。列宁说明，帝国主义是寄生的腐朽的资本主义，这首先表现在生产资料私有制下任何一种垄断对于技术的进步和其他一切进步具有停滞和腐化的作用。第二、脱离生产的庞大食利者阶层的形成。第三、由于资本输出，帝国主义国家的食利者阶层更变成了全世界十数万万劳动者身上的寄生虫。第四、财政资本必然日益趋向统治，反对自由，全面的政治上反动。第五、少数帝国主义国家变成食利国，变成依靠剥削其他多数国家和民族为生的国家。列宁指出了帝国主义的历史地位，他说，帝国主义是垂死的资本主义，因为资本主义已经过份成熟，从资本主义中间生长出来的垄断本身就已经表示资本主义正在死亡，表示它被社会主义代替的时机已经成熟，在帝国主义阶段所达到的如此高度社会化的生产，已经使生产资料的私有制变成不能容忍的不合于内容的外壳，它必须被粉碎。同时，列宁说明，帝国主义已使得资产阶级社会的一切矛盾达于空前的尖锐，这些矛盾的尖锐化，必然导向全世界最深刻的革命危机，而其结果，就是推动资本主义走向崩溃。因此，列宁指明：帝国主义是无产阶级社会主义革命的前夜。
    大家知道，列宁这本书是准备在沙皇制度下公开出版的，为了顾虑到沙皇政府的检查，有许多问题都不能畅所欲言，但在这本书和他同时期所写的其他文章中，列宁都着重指出：财政资本的统治和垄断加强了资本主义发展的不平衡，而其结果，必然导向帝国主义营垒内部冲突的加深和尖锐化，必然使得帝国主义走向武装冲突和战争，必然使得世界资本主义阵线削弱；所有这些条件，造成个别国家无产阶级突破帝国主义阵线的可能，社会主义首先在少数或者单独一个资本主义国家内获得胜利的可能。
    上面这些，就是列宁在《帝国主义是资本主义的最高阶段》这本书中所告诉给我们的不朽的真理。
    （二）
    列宁的这本书对我们来说是最可宝贵的，因为它给了我们以有力的思想武器，使我们能够从根本上来认识我们的敌人——美帝国主义。
    美国共产党主席福斯特在他的《世界资本主义的末日》一书中曾经指出：“大量美国人因之而吃苦头的最大的错觉之一，就是他们未能了解美国是一个帝国主义国家——实际上是世界上最具侵略性的帝国。这个国家具有伟大的列宁所分析的帝国主义时代的资本主义的一切特征。”
    其实在我们中国也是一样地有许多人因为未能了解美国是一个帝国主义国家而大吃苦头。例如说，有的人就这样设想过：“美国是一个自由主义国家。”
    究竟美国是一个自由主义国家还是一个帝国主义国家，我们不妨就从这个问题分析起。
    美国资本主义的发展确实曾经经过了一个自由竞争的阶段，就是在这个阶段上所唱出来的许多资产阶级的所谓民主、自由的调子曾经很使许多人心醉。但是，在美国，这个阶段早已经过去了，资本主义的自由竞争早已被资本主义的垄断所代替了。列宁在“帝国主义论”中根据四十年以前的材料，即一九○九年的材料，就已经指出了美国生产中的垄断倾向。他说道，在一九○九年，美国生产价值在一百万美元以上的企业集中了全国工人的百分之三○点五，出产了全国工业生产品的百分之四三点八；列宁根据这个材料做出结论：“由此可见，生产集中发展到相当程度时，便可以说是自然而然地走到垄断。”从一九○九年到现在，又已经有四十年过去了，这四十年美国生产的历史进一步地证明了列宁的论断。在一九三九年，美国一百万美元以上的企业已经集中了全国工人的百分之五五，生产了全国工业生产品的百分之六七点五。到一九四四年，这正是第二次世界大战快结束的时期，美国的军事定货有四分之三集中在一百家最大的垄断企业手中，而其中三十个超等的大垄断企业就独占了全国军事定货的二分之一。美国工业生产的垄断已经达到了这样的程度：全国纯铝的生产，全部掌握在一个公司手中，全国的铜矿，有百分之八十三掌握在六大公司手中，全国的钢铁，有百分之八十八是由十个大钢铁企业生产的，全国的汽车，有百分之八十六是由三个公司生产的，全国的农业机器，有一半是由一个名叫国际收割机公司生产的，全国化学肥料的生产，有百分之六十五掌握在七个公司手里，而全国百分之七十的肉食制造工业集中在四个公司手里。
    当然，美国今天的垄断是资本主义的垄断，因此这个垄断并不消灭竞争。但是，这个竞争已经不是“全体人民（资本家）机会均等”的自由竞争，而只是少数垄断者之间的火并与冲突。至于垄断者与非垄断者之间，与其说是自由竞争，毋宁说是吞并。例如：在一九四九年这一年中间在美国就有四十八万家独立的企业被垄断者所消灭。列宁在《帝国主义论》中说：“现在已经不是大企业和小企业竞争，技术落后企业与技术先进企业竞争了。现在，已经是垄断者窒杀那些不屈服于垄断、不屈服于垄断者的压迫及其意志的企业了。”
    从整个经济生活的领域说，成为美国帝国主义的最大特征的，乃是一小撮财政寡头支配着全美国最大部分货币资本和生产资料，支配着全部美国社会经济生活。在美国，有八个垄断一切的财政寡头，这就是摩尔根、洛克费尔、梅隆、杜邦、孔来勃这五个家族和三个地方银行集团，即芝加哥银行团、克里佛兰银行团与波士顿银行团。在美国，最巨大的公司一共有二百个，而这八大财政寡头就控制了其中的一百七十五个，单是摩尔根这一个财政寡头，就控制了四十一个。摩尔根手里差不多集中了全美国三分之一的工业生产，三分之二的钢产，四分之一长度的铁路和五大家银行。其他如孔来勃占有十三条铁路，洛克费尔占有全美国一半以上的石油生产，而杜邦与摩尔根差不多掌握了全美国爆炸物生产的百分之八十。美国这些垄断资本的发展是非常快的。列宁在“帝国主义论”中说，当时摩尔根与洛克费尔共拥有一一○亿马克即二五亿美元的资本，经过了几十年的发展，到现在，这两个最大的财政寡头的资本已增加到五二○亿美元（一说已达九四○亿美元），这就是说，已增加了几十倍。
    列宁曾经指出过，帝国主义的重要特征之一，是资本输出具有重要的意义，它使其他民族和国家成为少数财政寡头的债务人和纳贡者，这些以直接投资或贷款的形式进行的资本输出，成了少数财政寡头压迫、束缚和奴役全世界大多数民族和国家的坚实基础。如果就美国来说的话，资本输出对美帝国主义的发展尤其具有重要的意义。因为美帝国主义比起其他帝国主义来，是发展得比较晚的，当它登上帝国主义世界舞台的时候，世界上大部分未开发的国家业已被其他帝国主义国家所分割完毕了。因此它就着重于经济渗透的办法，用资本输出渗透到其他国家中去。特别是两次世界大战，使得美帝国主义发财致富，而其他资本主义国家却因战争的破坏而遭遇极大困难，这就给美帝国主义以可能，使它能够以资本输出做为手段去威胁和控制其他资本主义国家，夺取他们的政治、经济、军事主权，篡夺他们的殖民地，以建立自己的世界霸权。这个情势，在第二次世界大战以后是特别显著的，在一九四五年，美国输出资本的总额是一七三亿美元，至一九四八年，即已增至三四八亿美元。今天的形势是：美帝国主义已经成为资本主义世界财政资本输出的中心，资本主义世界的各个国家和民族大都成了美帝国主义少数财政寡头的债务人和纳贡者；美元，成了美帝国主义控制全部资本主义世界的武器，一切在“马歇尔计划”、“欧洲复兴方案”、“美援”、“第四点计划”等等名目下的资本输出，成了美帝国主义压迫，束缚和奴役资本主义世界大多数民族和国家的物质基础。大量的资本输出，已经给美帝国主义建立起了一个剥削和奴役整个资本主义世界的垄断体系。
    第二次世界大战刚结束的时候，一九四六年，美帝国主义借贷给英国三十七亿五千万美元的压力，迫使英国丧失了在货币、汇兑、进出口贸易方面的保护制度，使得阿梅里这样的英国大臣也怨诉起来，说“美国视大英帝国为牡蛎，想拿这一借款来迫使牡蛎张开它的壳。大英帝国的每一部分，如果失掉帝国优惠制的保护，就将一个个地被美国吃掉，将成为美国工业剥削的对象，将成为美国财阀的进贡国，最后则成为美国的领地。”一九四七年美帝国主义对法国的贷款，使它获得了对法国实施政治干涉和经济监督的部分权利。一九四八年开始的马歇尔计划，使美帝国主义获得了西德的军火垄断企业，获得了对其他十六个西欧国家关于工业建设、财政计划、进口关税、出口贸易，原料供给等方面的监督权或决定权。美帝国主义更以马歇尔计划为要挟手段使参加北大西洋侵略公约的马歇尔化的国家丧失了政治军事主权。由于美帝国主义以各种形式进行资本输出，西欧各国成了美帝国主义的附庸国乃至殖民地，成了美货与美国军火泛滥的市场。在商品倾销的打击下，西欧各国的经济迅速崩溃，大批工厂倒闭，工人失业。美帝国主义给予蒋介石集团六十亿美元的援助，则是另一个例子，它是作为我们中国全部国家主权的代价来支付的。由于我国人民斗争的胜利，才使我们祖国挣脱了美帝国主义的奴役，并使美帝国主义对中国的侵略计划遭受破产。
    总之，从以上我们所叙述的各种情形来看，美国今天并不是一个什么“自由主义”的国家，而是一个十足的帝国主义国家，并且是一个已经建立起对整个资本主义世界进行剥削和奴役的垄断体系的帝国主义国家。列宁在《帝国主义论》法文版与德文版序言中曾说过：“以小有产者劳动为基础的私有制、自由竞争、民主——所有这些原由资本家及其报纸用来欺骗工农群众的口号，都早已成为过去的了。资本主义已变成极少数‘先进’国用殖民政策压迫，用财政资本扼制地球上极大多数居民的全世界体系。”这话对于今天的美国是十分恰当的。
    （三）
    美国在经济领域中的垄断，反映到政治上来，就是最少数财政寡头的专政，就是垄断资本巨头与国家机构的直接结合，就是国家的法西斯化。
    美国今天的国家政权，并不是什么“民主”的政权，它实际上是由一个叫做“全国制造商协会”的组织掌握着的。这全国制造商协会是个什么组织呢？它是美国大资本家的一个联合组织，它拥有一万六千个庞大资本的企业，控制着六百亿美元的资本。它的领导机关，即所谓“十二人委员会”，是由美国的几个财政寡头集团如摩根、洛克费尔、梅隆、杜邦等的代表所组成。美国的政府机构和对内对外的重大政策，就是最后地由这个财政寡头的领导机关来确定。这个协会自己出版的小册子也这样说：全国制造商协会的领导机关“每天都保持着与国会领袖们、各部各局的领导者们的联系，为自己的会员们收集情报，并把工业集团对当前问题的观点告知有关的管理机关（即美国的政府机关）。”
    财政寡头不仅实际上把美国的国家权力集中在自己手上，并且把垄断资本的巨头或代理人与国家机构直接结合起来。美国政府的首脑人物，如国务卿艾奇逊，国家安全资源局主席薛明顿，杜鲁门特别助理顾问哈里曼，国务院负责对日和约谈判的外交政策顾问杜勒斯，美国驻联合国常任代表奥斯汀，美国驻西德高级专员麦克洛埃，美国前国防部长詹逊等等，都是由全国制造商协会派到杜鲁门政府中去的。艾奇逊，是“杜邦、洛克费尔二碳烷公司”的顾问，法律事务所“科文顿、达林洛、艾奇逊公司”的主人。薛明顿，在第二次世界大战期间是“安默生电气公司”的经理。哈里曼，是美国最大富翁之一，“布朗兄弟、哈里曼银行公司”的经理。麦克洛埃，是洛克费尔的“大通银行”的顾问。詹逊是“联合飞机制造公司”的经理。在一九四八年初，杜鲁门曾任命了差不多五十个银行老板大资本家在美国政府中担任领导地位。
    美国财政寡头的专政在今天的特点是已经走上了最反动、最野蛮、最残暴的道路，这就是法西斯化的道路。福斯特在“世界资本主义的末日”中曾经指出：美国的垄断资本家们“控制着政府和其他一切重要的机关，他们为了自身的目的而加以利用。这些占统治地位的垄断资本家，基本上都是不民主的，甚至是法西斯主义的。在美国，跟在其他地方一样，帝国主义已到了法西斯的阶段”。
    事实上，美国现在已经完全成了一个警察国家。美国的垄断资本家已经日益依靠庞大的特务系统来统治和镇压人民。美国司法部的联邦调查局，是一个规模庞大的特务机关，在一九四六年的时候，它就拥有一万四千三百名专业特务，此外还有更多的兼业特务，称为“联邦调查局之友”。这些特务，被教以各种侦察、追踪、暗杀的技术。一九四七年，根据杜鲁门的命令，他们对二百万公务人员和十万原子能工作者进行了侦察和审问，对这几百万人的每一个人的生活方式、政治见解、来往朋友关系等作了详细的记录，并强迫这些人举行“忠心”宣誓。他们对美国的进步分子进行秘密登记，名为“国家安全索引”，每年都有几十万美国人被列入这个黑名单里。他们所制定的所谓“国家安全”法，规定共产党员与其他民主团体的会员必须去警察机关登记，实行最严格的警察监视制度，并规定一旦总统宣布“非常状态”，就要把所谓的“破坏分子”大量逮捕和不经审讯地把他们监禁在集中营里，这项法令管制的约有五十五万人。此外，至一九四九年十二月一日，联邦调查局已登记了一亿一千三百万个美国人的指纹印，这数字超过了全部美国人口的四分之三以上，就是说，几乎每一个美国人民都被秘密警察记录下来当作潜在的罪犯。纽约市公务员委员会主席保罗·卡恩曾说：“联邦调查局到处都有特务，已经开始保持记载美国一切人民活动的庞大警察档案。”今天在世界上，没有一个国家有美国这样多的特务，没有一个国家的人民像美国这样最普遍地受着侦察和监视。美国今天已经成了法西斯反动的大本营。
    从上面的说明可以看到，美国今天已经不只是一般的帝国主义国家，并且是已经发展成最反动、最野蛮、最专制的帝国主义国家。这正如列宁在“帝国主义论”中所说：“帝国主义是财政资本和垄断制的时代，而财政资本和垄断制到处散布的都是统治趋向，而不是自由趋向。这统治趋向的结果，就是在一切政治制度下都发生全面的反动，就是政治制度方面的矛盾也极端尖锐化起来。”
    （四）
    说美帝国主义是最反动、最野蛮、最专制的，这还没有包括尽它的特点。它的最重要的特点是它的侵略性。美帝国主义是今天世界上最富于侵略性的帝国主义。
    这首先是因为，美帝国主义是依靠战争成长起来的，是在世界各国特别是欧亚两洲人民的血泊中发财致富肥胖起来的。美帝国主义者，是世界上最“习惯于从千百万人民的鲜血中，以及母亲和儿子们的眼泪中”攫取财富的人。
    当一九一四年第一次世界大战爆发的时候，美国正处在经济萧条中，这次战争，帮助美国度过了萧条，并给它带来了一个空前活跃的生产和工业发展的时期。大量的军事定货，对交战国的贷款以及巨量的商品输出，培育了美帝国主义经济力量的成长。这次战争，使美帝国主义赚取了比其他任何帝国主义更多的利润。关于这时的美帝国主义，列宁曾经在“致美国工人的信”中说过：“他们把一切甚至最富有的国家都变成了自己的纳贡者。他们掠夺了数千亿美元……每一块美元上都凝结着血迹，这是在一千万死者和两千万伤者所流成的血海中染上的……”
    至于第二次世界大战，那么，它更加使得美帝国主义发财致富。在这次战争中，美帝国主义各企业一共赚取了八百七十亿美元的利润，各垄断资本组织获得了五百三十亿美元的纯利。个别公司在战争年份——一九四二年所获得的利润竟超过战前年份平均利润的一百倍以上。千百万人的鲜血，再一次地变成了金元，流进美帝国主义财政寡头的钱袋里。
    在战争的血泊中成长起来的美帝国主义，使自己形成了一个膨大而臃肿的工业机构，这个机构只有依靠战争的鲜血的不断注入，才能够维持自己的高额利润，甚至于才能维持自己的生命。两次世界大战，使美国的工业生产获得了极度的膨胀，这之中特别是军火工业以及与它密切结合着的钢铁、石油、煤、摩托和机器制造业的膨胀。这些膨胀的工业已经完全无法按照通常的途径来完成它的资本循环，而这个循环如果一旦停止，不仅丰厚的高额利润化为乌有，而且一个猛烈的经济危机就立刻会降临。因此，它只有依靠不断的军事定货才能维持自己的生命。福斯特在他的《世界资本主义的末日》一书中说道：“美国资本主义的情势不仅对美国人民，而且对全世界都已成为严重的危险。因为喝了战争的鲜血而膨胀肿大的美国资本主义，其食欲已发展到极端危险的程度。美国工业的生产力，依靠它那人为的战争养料在战争中已增加了价值二百五十亿美元的工厂生产力（比德国整个战前的工业生产力还要多）。它现在已变得如此庞大，以至已无法通过正常贸易途径，在国内与世界市场上来销售它那堆积如山的各种商品了……他们提议主要用建立巨大的战争经济的办法来填补生产和消费之间的经济缺口，而这种战争经济每年将以二百亿或四百亿美元的军需定货来喂养美国工业。实际上，这就是他们现在所正在做的。”
    就因为以上的原因，所以美帝国主义在第二次世界大战结束以后，就一直叫嚣着战争，制造出种种紧张局势，发动侵略朝鲜的战争，并企图挑起一个新的战争，以利用这种形势来维持自己的军事生产。
    美帝国主义这种追求战争的政策，维持了美国垄断资本家的高额利润，并使这利润向上增长着。例如，一九四七年美国垄断资本家的总利润是一八○亿美元，一九四八年即增至二一○亿美元。今年不久以前，美国全国军备委员会召集了一个美国大工业资本家的会议，在会议上霍华德说明了战争对于美国经济事业有如何的必要，并宣布：在“非常情况”的头六个月内，陆、海、空军三部将给予美国工业界四百一十亿美元的定货单。这个宣布，引起了到会大资本家的极大满意。美帝国主义在朝鲜掀起了战争以后，美国的一个杂志《新闻周刊》就记载道：“从射击开始后，石油公司的指数提高了几点”，“铁路也因军事的加剧而获利”等等。
    美帝国主义之所以是今天世界上最富于侵略性的帝国主义，这又是因为它企图以对全世界的征服来挽救自己的灭亡。美帝国主义虽然已经日益把自己的经济运转建立在对全世界相当大部分国家和人民的剥削上，但这并没有解脱了它自己的危机。这种情况逼使它加紧向全世界扩张，希图以对全世界的统治，以剥削和奴役整个世界，来维持它自己腐朽的寄生的经济制度。
    我们已经知道，在第二次世界大战中，美帝国主义的经济力量达到了极度的膨胀。如果一九三七年美国工业生产的指数是一○○的话，则最高数一九四三年已增加至二一二，就是说，增加了一倍。到第二次世界大战结束以后，这增长起来的经济力量却遇着一个日益缩小的国内市场，在美国国内的购买力，已经根本无法来使美帝国主义的增长起来的垄断经济进行正常的运转。它既不能容纳大批堆集起来的商品，也不能容纳在战争中大量增殖起来的资本。美帝国主义解脱这个危机的方法除了维持军事生产之外，就是极力向国外扩张。
    美帝国主义这种向国外的扩张，是早就在进行着的。第二次世界大战以后所形成的资本主义世界的局势，则极端加强了这种扩张。由于第二次世界大战，在国际舞台上与美帝国主义相倾轧的五个帝国主义，有三个（德、日、意）被打倒了，其他英国和法国则遭受了极大的削弱，只有美帝国主义由于自己所处的天然有利的战略地位，不仅没有遭受破坏，反而特别发展起来。美帝国主义利用了这种形势，加强了它对整个资本主义世界的掠夺。在西欧，它利用“马歇尔计划”“借款”等等手段，获取了对英、法、比、荷、卢、瑞士、瑞典、葡、挪、丹等资本主义国家在各种程度上的财政经济支配权，加强了对它们的资本输出，并使美货在这些国家中泛滥开来。它经过“北大西洋公约”等等方法又取得了美国军火商品对这些参加国家的推销。对于战败了的三个法西斯国家：在西德，它大批收买各种企业，以及以投资渗透到某些企业中去，它夺取了德国的二百吨黄金，运走了美国所没有的稀有金属原料及其制炼工厂，窃取了近二十万种专利权，并对西德最主要的鲁尔工业区进行了独占的活动。在日本，它大量投资在三井、三菱、住友、安田四大财政寡头的一系列企业中，与它们完全结合起来，同时，又对日本进行大量贷款与商品倾销。在意大利，“马歇尔计划”迫使意大利放弃钢铁、造纸、机器、摩托、化学等工业，而代之以罐头、啤酒之类的生产。美国的调查团，遍布意大利。意大利的财政经济主权实际上是掌握在美帝国主义手中。在西班牙，它大量投资于航空、交通建设、铁路、橡胶、石油等经济事业中，并对西班牙大量贷款。在希腊，它获得了全部财政经济主权，它收买了希腊的福拉基亚铅矿，收买了各大企业的股票，并使希腊变成了它的原料供应地和商品倾销市场。在土耳其，它出卖了大量的军火商品，并给土耳其大量贷款，又取得了加满达哈和阿丹纳两区的石油开采权，以及其他矿产的开发权利。在远东：在印尼，它占有成百万英亩的橡胶园，占有五百多处石油井，它在这个殖民地领土上的投资已占其全部外国投资的五分之四。在朝鲜南部，它获取了全部财政经济的支配权，并把南朝鲜变成了美国商品的垄断市场。至于菲律宾，这早已是美国的殖民地，并且现在实际上仍是它的殖民地。此外，它插足于英国的殖民地印度和法国的殖民地越南，使这些地方变成它的投资场所和商品市场。在近东的伊朗、伊拉克、阿拉伯等国，那里的石油产量占全世界产量的百分之四十五，美国利用第二次世界大战后英法等国的削弱，对那里的石油开采权尽力争夺，总计它在近东的石油投资已占该地全部投资的百分之四十一以上。在非洲：在埃及，它获得了石油开采权，并给埃及大批借款。至于利比里亚，这完全是它的殖民地，是它的橡胶、金矿及其他矿产的供给地。对非洲的其他帝国主义的殖民地，它也积极伸入自己的势力，例如它对英属南非联邦大量输出商品，并投资于德兰士瓦的金矿。它获得了比属刚果的铀矿及其他矿产。至于美洲各国，这完全是它独占的原料市场、销售市场和投资市场。英属的加拿大，也完全成了它的附庸，在经济上被它所控制。
    从以上的情形看起来，美帝国主义今天实际上已经把资本主义世界所有国家和民族变成了它的附属国、半殖民地和殖民地，已经建立起了一个剥削和奴役整个资本主义世界的垄断体系；而这也就是说，它已经把自己的经济寄生在对全世界相当大部分国家和人民的剥削上。恰如福斯特所说：“美国资本主义有如一种庞大的寄生虫，倚傍世界资本主义的其余部分而生活；它像吃人生番似地吞食着其他资本主义国家，并依靠他们的生活资料以自肥。”
    然而，美帝国主义的腐朽已经到了这样的程度，就是即使建立起了一个对整个资本主义世界的剥削体系，也仍然解救不了它自身的危机。尽管在第二次世界大战以后它对整个资本主义世界进行了猛烈的扩张，它的商品出口数字却是逐年下降。一九四七年美帝国主义输出商品总值一五三亿美元，一九四八年降为一二六亿美元，一九四九年降为一二三亿美元，一九五○年根据第一季的数字推算仅达九五亿美元。这数字非常清楚地反映了一个国外市场日趋缩小的情况。一九四八年和一九四九年尽管有占出口总额三分之一的马歇尔计划出口货物，也并没有能阻止这下降的趋势。
    国外和国内市场日趋缩小的结果，就是商品的囤积。如果以一九三五——三九年的商品存货为基数一○○，则一九四五年的指数为一六六，一九四六年为二一三，一九四七年为二五五，一九四七年初，美国商品存货达三五○亿美元，至一九四七年底，增长至五○○亿美元，一九四八年更增至五八六亿美元。
    商品存货的增加，这就是说资本被压积，资本循环被中断，资本失掉它的剥削的生命力。而这情况的必然结果，就是生产的萎缩。美国工业生产指数在一九四三年曾达到了它的最高峰，为二一二，这以后总的趋势就是逐渐下降。一九四五年是一八○，一九四六年是一五○，一九四七年是一六五，一九四八年是一七○，一九四九年的一月是一六五，一九五○年的一月则是一五七。
    商品出口的减少，商品存货的增加，生产的下降——这就是说，一个新的经济危机已经在敲美帝国主义的大门。
    在这种情况下面，美帝国主义企图以加紧向其他国家和民族的侵略来解救自身的危机，它企图以对整个世界的奴役和剥削来维持它自己腐朽的寄生经济制度，来挽救自己垂死的命运。这一点，正是美帝国主义之所以是今天世界上最富于侵略性的帝国主义的基本原因。
    毛主席在《目前形势和我们的任务》一文中说：“美国帝国主义在第二次世界大战期间所增强起来的经济力量，遇着了不稳定的日趋缩小的国内市场与国际市场。这种市场的进一步缩小，就要引起经济危机的爆发。美国的战争景气，仅仅是一时的现象。它的强大，只是表面的与暂时的。危机就像一座火山，每天都在威胁美国帝国主义，美国帝国主义就是坐在这座火山上。这种情况，迫使美国帝国主义分子建立了奴役世界的计划，像野兽一样，向欧、亚两洲及其他地方乱窜，集合各国的反动势力，那些被人民唾弃的渣滓，组成帝国主义及反民主的阵营，反对以苏联为首的一切民主势力，准备战争，企图在将来，在遥远的时间内，有一天发动第三次世界大战打败民主力量。这是一个狂妄的计划。全世界民主势力必须打败这个计划，也完全能够打败它。”
    （五）
    现在，让我们来结束对美帝国主义的分析。
    列宁在“帝国主义论”中论到帝国主义的历史地位的时候，曾说过：帝国主义是垂死的资本主义。这就是说，在帝国主义阶段，资本主义已经走到了它死亡的边缘。
    在整个世界上，资本主义曾经经历过它的青春的、向上发展的时期。在这个时期中，人类社会曾经向前进了一大步，与资本主义伴随而来的工业革命，曾把社会的生产力增大了许多倍。但是，当它进入帝国主义阶段以后，它就转入了一个衰老的、向下没落的时期。在这个时候，它不仅不能给人类带来任何的进步，而且处处都强烈地阻碍着人类的继续向前发展。只有以无产阶级的社会主义革命来消灭帝国主义，才能使人类继续向前进。列宁在《机会主义与第二国际的破产》一文中说：“资本帝国主义时代是资本主义已经成熟而且过分成熟的时代，这时资本主义已经处在自身崩溃的前夜，已经成熟到要让位给社会主义的地步。”
    资本主义让位给社会主义——这就是在帝国主义时期人类社会发展所要完成的任务。
    一九一七年的十月革命，第一次解决了这个任务。由于十月革命的胜利，资本主义的统治在世界六分之一的地面上崩溃了。当时世界上几个最主要的帝国主义国家之一的沙俄帝国主义被推下了历史舞台。在世界上，出现了第一个社会主义国家——苏联。从此，在全人类面前展开了一个新的时代，这就是社会主义的上升并最后在全世界完全胜利与资本主义的衰亡并最后在全世界完全消灭的时代。
    十月革命的胜利，震动了资本主义世界各国。他们企图挽救这第一次帝国主义的覆灭。一九一八年，美、英、日等十四个帝国主义国家进行了对苏联的围攻，当时整个世界的资产阶级都断言着社会主义要灭亡。然而，三年战争的结果，并不是社会主义灭亡，而是它的胜利与帝国主义的失败。这以后，直到第二次世界大战，在世界上，一方面是苏联社会主义建设的胜利，一方面则是资本主义各国的危机与内在矛盾的尖锐化。
    在第二次世界大战中，一九四一年，爆发了苏德战争。德国法西斯的入侵苏联，实际上是整个资本主义世界长时期支持和纵容德国，企图把德国变成反苏哨兵的结果，虽然这种政策也使英、法这些帝国主义国家自己吃了苦头。
    第二次世界大战以社会主义苏联的胜利和帝国主义法西斯德、日、意的失败而告结束。这次战争的结果，一方面是社会主义苏联的更加强盛，是在东南欧出现了一整批走向社会主义的国家，是伟大的新民主主义新中国的建立，是又有六万万以上人口摆脱了资本主义世界的奴役而走进以苏联为首的社会主义和平民主阵营；另一方面，则是整个资本主义世界的空前削弱。六个最大的帝国主义国家有三个（德、日、意）被打倒，有两个（英、法）被大大削弱，因而在世界上只留下了最后一个大的帝国主义美国。
    这样，在世界上就出现了一个新的局面，这就是：以苏联为首的社会主义和平民主阵营的力量已经超过了以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义阵营的力量。从十月革命到现在只不过是三十三年，资本主义却以这样迅速的速度向下没落，这说明了资本主义确实已经走尽了它的历程。
    在这样的一个局面下，美帝国主义今天在世界上的各种疯狂行动，实际上只是一种挣扎，一种企图挽救自己以及整个资本主义世界没落命运的挣扎。但是，历史的发展是无情的，任何想人为地保持资本主义奴役制度的挣扎都并不能挽救自己的灭亡。
    马林科夫在一九四九年十月革命节庆祝会上的演说中说：“我们不要战争，而且我们将尽一切力量来防止战争，但任何人都不要以为我们为战争贩子的虚张声势所吓倒了。不是我们，而是帝国主义者和侵略者才害怕战争。历史的经验告诉了我们什么呢？它告诉我们：帝国主义者所发动的第一次世界大战的结果，是我国获得了伟大的十月社会主义革命的胜利。历史的经验还告诉我们：帝国主义者所发动的第二次世界大战的结果，是东南欧许多国家中建立了人民民主政权，是伟大的中国人民赢得了胜利。如果帝国主义者发动第三次世界大战，这就意味着不但个别资本主义国家的灭亡，而且意味着整个资本主义世界的灭亡，这一点还能有任何的怀疑吗？”
