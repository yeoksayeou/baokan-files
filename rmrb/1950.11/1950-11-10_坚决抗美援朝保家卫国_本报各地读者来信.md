Resolutely Resist America and Aid Korea, Defend Our Homes and Country
    -- Letters from Readers Across the Country

    Ready to Contribute Everything at Any Time
    Smash the U.S. Imperialist Conspiracy Editor:
    Recently, U.S. imperialism again attacked our coastal areas of Shandong with airplanes. I and the masses around me are extremely angry at this shameless provocation! We firmly support Foreign Minister Zhou’s protest to the United Nations. In the future, we must more closely unite with our fellow workers to raise our vigilance and never allow imperialism to burn the flames of war onto our country’s territory. In order to defend the motherland, we are prepared to contribute all our strength at any time to smash the U.S. imperialist conspiracy. I call on my fellow workers to actively produce and increase the country’s economic strength.
           Model Worker of Industry, Southern Jiangsu, East China   Lun Zushun

    Request to Fight Side-by-Side with the Korean People’s Army
    Beat the American Robbers to Death in the Places They Occupy Editor:
    The U.S. imperialist lackey Syngman Rhee says we have no right to enjoy one kilowatt-hour of electricity from the Yalu River power station. U.S. imperialism is also plotting to use Japanese militarists and the Chiang Kai-shek bandits to attack us. This is something we cannot tolerate. We demand to fight side-by-side with the Korean People’s Army and beat the American robbers to death in the places they occupy.

    Before Embarking on the Journey to Korea to Participate in the War
    We Must Do a Good Job in Public Security and Defense Work for the People’s Railways Editor:
    U.S. imperialism’s aggression against Korea is becoming more and more frantic; its provocative actions against our motherland are also becoming more and more hateful. Our national anthem is issuing a call at all times, "Arise! Ye who refuse to be slaves!" And now the time has really come to rise up.
    We are all members of the New Democratic Youth League. We deeply realize that U.S. imperialism’s aggression against Korea is the first step in its aggression against China.
    Now, in order to fulfill the duties of a League member as stipulated in Article 7, Section 2 of the League Constitution -- "Devote oneself to the motherland with infinite loyalty" -- we volunteer to go to Korea to participate in the battle against U.S. imperialism. Our fight for the freedom and happiness of the Korean people is also a fight for the independence and security of our motherland.
    Before embarking on the journey, we are willing to do a good job in the public security and defense work of the people’s railways and strengthen the safety of transportation at our current work posts.
    We are willing to make our aspirations public before the people of the whole country.

    Strengthen Learning and Complete Production Plans Ahead of Schedule
    Oppose U.S. Imperialist Aggression and Defend the Security of the Motherland Editor:
    Our machinists were extremely indignant when they learned that U.S. imperialist planes had again continuously strafed and bombed our people in the Northeast, killing and wounding our compatriots and causing huge losses to our people, and that the invading U.S. troops had advanced to the border of our Northeast, seriously threatening our country's security. We are determined to avenge the dead compatriots. Everyone also unanimously said: We guarantee to complete the transportation work on the Yellow River to oppose the crazy aggression of U.S. imperialism and defend the security of the motherland. Machinist Yuan Zhenhua said: "We must use the results of our actual work as weapons. At this time, we must step up production even more. If U.S. imperialism wants to invade our country's territory, I am determined to arm myself and fight them." Driver Zhang Shijie said: "I can drive a car. If U.S. imperialism invades us, I will definitely go to the front to drive a car for transportation." Machinist Zhang Wenxiang said: "If U.S. imperialism comes, I will pick up a big hammer and fight twenty or so of them, smashing their brains out." Squad Leader Zhao Ziju said: "We have a powerful people's army. U.S. imperialism is a paper tiger. We are not afraid of him, but we cannot be complacent about the gang of bandits and special agents." Finally, everyone unanimously expressed that they would strengthen their studies, work hard in production, and strive to complete their monthly work plan ahead of schedule.

    My Township Paid 170,000 Jin of Public Grain
    Support the Korean People in Fighting the American Wolf Editor:
    On the evening of October 30, the masses of Shaolan Village (belonging to Nanchang County, Jiangxi Province) held a mass meeting to discuss the current situation. Everyone was very angry at the aggressive and violent acts of U.S. imperialism in Korea and China. Almost everyone expressed their opinions. Everyone unanimously stated: We working people are willing to contribute all our strength to the country, support the front lines, support the Korean people, and fight the American wolf!
    In order to cherish our motherland, we paid 178,837 jin more of public grain. Our farmers are very happy because this is a practical action to show our love for the motherland.
    Now our entire village is stepping up production, expanding the militia organization, preventing bandits and special agents from sabotage and spreading rumors, and consolidating our victory.
    In short, we are willing to contribute everything and vow to fight to the end to defend the motherland and defend world peace.

    We are Ready to Extinguish the Flames of Aggression
    Defend the Fruits of Victory and Defend the Motherland Editor:
    On June 25, U.S. imperialism launched the war of aggression against Korea and frantically expanded this crime, invading our airspace, strafing and bombing. Disregarding the opposition of all peace-loving people and the repeated protests of Foreign Minister Zhou, U.S. imperialism is trying to burn the flames of war onto the mainland of China, seriously threatening our country's peaceful construction. We must not tolerate this arrogant and domineering behavior of the American aggressors. We firmly support Foreign Minister Zhou’s repeated accusations to the United Nations, and call on all faculty, staff, students, and cultural workers in primary and secondary schools in our province to be doubly vigilant against this crazy behavior of U.S. imperialism, work hard to study, strengthen our work, prepare ourselves fully, and respond to the call of the motherland at any time, giving the aggressors a fatal blow. Korea is our neighbor, and we have a responsibility to support the Korean people and cannot turn a blind eye.
    Our will: in an intolerable situation, stand tall, greet them with a fighting attitude, defend the territory and sacred borders, defend the people's fruits of victory, defend the motherland's civilization and freedom. We can and are prepared to extinguish the flames of aggression with our blood, and let the aggressors turn to ashes with the flames. We not only shout this out, but also put our vows into practice with practical actions when the motherland needs us.
            All Comrades of the Department of Culture and Education of the Liaodong Provincial People's Government

    粉碎美帝侵略阴谋编辑同志：
    美帝国主义最近又以飞机侵袭我山东沿海，我和我周围群众对这种无耻的挑衅行为极端愤恨！我们坚决拥护周外长向联合国提出的抗议，我们今后更要紧密团结工友同志们提高警觉，决不容许帝国主义把战争火焰烧向我国的领土。为了保卫祖国，我们准备着随时贡献一切力量，粉碎美帝侵略阴谋。我号召工友同志们积极生产，增加国家的经济力量。

    要求与朝鲜人民军并肩作战
    打死美国强盗在它侵占的地方编辑同志：
    美帝走狗李承晚说我们无权利享受鸭绿江发电站一千瓦时的电，美帝还阴谋利用日本军国主义者及蒋匪帮向我们进攻。这是我们不能容忍的。我们要求与朝鲜人民军并肩作战，将美国强盗打死在他们所侵占的地方。
    北京电信工人合作社  常安民  刘范民  王桂英  赵幼贞  丁则延
    在没有踏上征途赴朝参战之前
    要作好人民铁路公安保卫工作编辑同志：
    美帝对朝鲜的侵略，是越来越疯狂；对我们祖国的挑衅行为，也越来越可恶。我们的国歌，随时都在发出号召，“起来！不愿做奴隶的人们！”而现在真的已经到了起来的时候了。
    我们都是新民主主义青年团团员。我们深深地认识到：美帝对朝鲜的侵略，就是对我们中国侵略的第一步。
    现在为了要履行团章第七条第二项规定的团员义务——“以无限忠诚，献身祖国。”我们志愿赴朝参加抗击美帝的战斗。我们为朝鲜人民的自由与幸福而战，也就是为我们祖国的独立与安全而战。
    在没踏上征途之前，我们愿在现有的工作岗位上，搞好人民铁路的公安保卫工作，加强运输的安全工作。
    我们愿将我们的志愿，公开在全国人民面前。

    加强学习提前完成生产计划
    反对美帝侵略保卫祖国安全编辑同志：
    我们机工队工人在知道美帝飞机又连续扫射轰炸我东北人民，炸死炸伤了我们的同胞，使我人民受到了巨大损失，以及侵朝美军向我东北边境前进，严重威胁我国安全以后，激愤万分。我们坚决要为死难的同胞报仇。大家并一致说：保证完成黄河上的运输工作，来反对美帝的疯狂侵略，保卫祖国安全。机匠袁振华说：“我们要拿实际工作的成绩当武器，这时我们更要加紧生产，如美帝要来侵略我国的领土，我决心武装起来去打他们。”司机张士杰说：“我会开汽车，如果美帝来侵略我们，我决到前方开汽车去运输。”机匠张文祥说：“美帝要来的话，我拿起大铁锤也要拚他二十几个，打他个脑浆崩裂。”赵子久队长说：“我们有强大的人民军队，美帝是一个纸老虎，我们是不怕他的，可是我们也不能对匪帮特务不加警惕。”最后大家一致表示，要加强学习，努力生产，争取提前完成每月的工作计划。

    我乡多缴了十七万斤公粮
    支援朝鲜人民打击美国狼编辑同志：
    十月三十日晚上，少蓝村（属江西省南昌县）群众开了个群众会，讨论了当前的时局，大家对美帝在朝鲜在中国的侵略暴行，都非常愤恨。差不多每个人都发表了意见。大家一致表示：我们劳动人民愿以所有的力量贡献给国家，支援前方，支援朝鲜人民，打击美国狼！
    为了爱护我们的祖国，我们的公粮多缴了十七万八千八百三十七斤。我们农民都很高兴，因为这就是我们热爱祖国的一种实际行动。
    现在我们全村正在加紧生产，扩大民兵组织，防止匪特破坏、造谣，巩固我们的胜利。
    总之，我们愿意贡献一切，誓为保卫祖国，保卫世界和平而奋斗到底。
      农业劳模  罗来贵
    我们准备扑灭侵略火焰
    保卫胜利果实保卫祖国编辑同志：
    美帝在六月二十五日发动了侵略朝鲜战争，并疯狂的扩大这一罪行，侵我领空，扫射轰炸。美帝不顾一切爱好和平人民的反对和周外长的屡次抗议，竟想把战争的火焰燃烧到中国的大陆，严重地威胁着我们祖国的和平建设。我们决不能容忍美国侵略者的这种横行霸道，坚决拥护周外长屡次向联合国的控诉，并号召我省中小学全体教职员学生及文化工作者，对美帝这一疯狂行为加倍警惕，努力学习，加强工作，充分准备，随时响应祖国的号召，给侵略者以致命的打击。朝鲜是我们的邻邦，我们有责任支援朝鲜人民，不能置之不理。
    我们的意志：在不能容忍的情况下，挺起胸膛，以战斗的姿态迎接上去，保卫国土与神圣的边疆，保卫人民的胜利果实，保卫祖国的文明与自由，我们能够并已经准备着用热血扑灭侵略的火焰，并让侵略者随火焰化为灰烬。我们不但这样高呼，并将要在祖国需要我们的时候，用实际行动实现自己的誓言。
