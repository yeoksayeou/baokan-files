　　To Relieve Disaster Victims and Strengthen Anti-American Aggression and Aid Korea Propaganda
    Beihai Will Hold a New Quyi Fireworks Charity Performance; Ticket Presales Begin Today
    Beihai Park, in order to raise more winter clothing donations for disaster-stricken people in northern Anhui and northern Jiangsu, and to strengthen the awareness of the broad masses about resisting America and aiding Korea, will hold a three-day new quyi and fireworks charity performance at Beihai on the 10th, 11th, and 12th of this month. The park is decorated with large cloth banner cartoons and slogans. From 1 to 4 o'clock during the day, dozens of famous actors such as Cao Baolu, Lian Kuoru, Yin Fulai, Wei Changlin, Wei Xikui, and Song Huiling will perform their signature pieces, and several yangko teams and flower drum teams are scheduled to perform wonderful programs in the park. From 7 to 9 o'clock at night, fireworks will be set off in two locations on the lake, including giant lightning slogans of "Resist America, Aid Korea, Defend the Homeland," as well as over twenty kinds of excellent fireworks such as myriad dragon fire umbrellas, silver dragon presenting auspiciousness, peace flowers, and interception flowers, with very rich content. Because the cost is relatively high, and it is also a disaster relief charity performance, ordinary tickets are priced at 1,000 yuan, and half-price tickets are 500 yuan. In order to avoid excessive crowding of citizens buying tickets to enter the park, ticket presales will begin on the 8th at the park itself, as well as Zhongshan Park, Xijiao Park, the Forbidden City, and Jingshan. During the charity performance, additional ticket windows will be opened at the front and rear gates, and more temporary ticket offices will be set up to facilitate visitors. It is bound to be a grand occasion.

　　为救济灾胞及加强抗美援朝宣传
    北海将举办新曲艺焰火义演
    今日起已开始预售门票
    北海公园为了皖北、苏北等地受灾难胞，多募集一些寒衣捐款，又为了加强广大群众对抗美援朝的认识，定于本月十、十一、十二日，在北海举办新曲艺焰火义演三天，园内布置了大型布幔的漫画和标语，白天一至四点有曹宝禄、连阔如、尹福来、魏长林、魏喜奎、宋慧玲等数十位著名演员演出拿手好戏，并约定若干秧歌队、花鼓队来园表演精彩节目，夜晚七至九点在海内分两处燃放焰火，有巨型“抗美援朝、保家卫国”雷光标语，万龙火伞、银龙献瑞、太平花、截花等二十余种出色焰火，内容非常丰富。因为成本较大，同时又是赈灾义演，故普通券规定一千元，半价券五百元。又为避免市民购票入园过分拥挤，将在本园及中山公园、西郊公园、故宫、景山等处，从八日起先期售票。义演时，并在前后门多开售票洞口，多设临时售票处，以便利游人，届时定有一番盛况。
