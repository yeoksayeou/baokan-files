　　Xinhua News Agency, 7th. The All-China Railway Workers' Union issued a declaration on the 7th calling on all railway workers to respond to the joint declaration of various democratic parties with practical actions. The declaration, after explaining the tense situation of US imperialism's armed aggression against Korea, which seriously infringes on our country's security and threatens world peace, pointed out: The joint declaration issued on the 4th by various democratic parties, headed by the Communist Party of China, expressing the vow to fully support the nationwide people's struggle on a voluntary basis for the sacred task of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea to protect our homes and defend the country, appropriately expresses our will and demands and inspires our courage a hundredfold.

　　The declaration calls on all railway workers and their families to unite around the trade union and the people of the whole country to fight with practical actions for resisting US aggression and aiding Korea, protecting our homes and defending the country, and striving for peace. The declaration says: To this end, we must: 1. Promote a high degree of patriotism and carry out mass production competition movements. Comrade Li Yong, the model locomotive flag bearer of the national railways, initiated the over-axle movement, using the method of hauling more and running faster while mastering speed and stability, to strive to complete the annual transportation task ahead of schedule. This is a call of great significance. It is hoped that labor heroes, model workers, and advanced producers in various work positions on the national railways will fully play a coordinating role around Comrade Li Yong's call, formulate production plans according to different production conditions, and make this call a universal practical action. 2. Pay attention to the development of the situation at all times, heighten vigilance, expose rumors, strengthen anti-bandit, anti-spy, fire prevention, and anti-theft work, cherish public property, and protect the safety of the people's railways.

　　The declaration finally pointed out: China's railway workers, endowed with the glorious revolutionary tradition of the Chinese working class, have always stood at the forefront of the people's liberation struggle and production construction, and have never bowed their heads in the face of any difficulties or enemies. Today, we must even more hold high the banner of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea, protecting our homes and defending the country with an iron will, shatter the aggressive conspiracies of US imperialism, protect peace, and defend the people. Final victory must belong to us.
