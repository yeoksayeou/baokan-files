The People's Liberation Army, ordered to advance into Tibet, liberated Changdu, an important town in western Xikang, on October 19, opening the gateway to Tibet. This great action of the People's Liberation Army aims to liberate the Tibetan compatriots, expel the aggressive forces of imperialism, complete the great cause of unifying the motherland, defend and build our western frontier, and safeguard world peace. Therefore, the People's Liberation Army marching into Tibet has been warmly welcomed by the Kang and Tibetan compatriots, warmly supported by the entire Chinese people, and warmly sympathized with by peace-loving people all over the world. The attempt by the Indian government to obstruct such a righteous action cannot but surprise and disappoint the Chinese people.

Tibet is an integral part of Chinese territory, just as South Wales is an integral part of Britain and Mumbai is an integral part of India. As early as thirteen or four hundred years ago, Tibet established close relations with the Chinese mainland, and since 1794, Tibet has officially become a part of China. However, foreign imperialists have constantly coveted this western territory of China. After occupying India, Britain further attempted to seize Tibet, launching armed invasions of Tibet twice in 1887 and 1904. Foreign aggressors colluded with Tibetan reactionaries, adopting various political and economic methods to cruelly exploit and oppress the Tibetan people, which aroused strong resistance from the Tibetan people. After the Chinese people's liberation war won an epoch-making victory, American and British imperialists continued to send spies into Tibet and strengthened military assistance to the Tibetan reactionary authorities, attempting to prevent Tibet from returning to the embrace of the great Chinese motherland. Tibet is Chinese territory, and our Central People's Government certainly has the sacred responsibility to liberate Tibet and defend Tibet. This issue, which is purely an internal affair of our country, should of course not be interfered with by any country that respects China's territorial sovereignty.

The Indian government attempts to pit the People's Liberation Army's advance into Tibet against the Central People's Government's desire for a peaceful resolution of the Tibetan issue, which is completely contrary to the facts. In fact, the peaceful resolution of the Tibetan issue not only cannot hinder the People's Liberation Army's advance, but must also take the peaceful acceptance of the People's Liberation Army's advance as a condition. Our Central People's Government has consistently adhered to the peaceful resolution of the Tibetan issue in the past and present, but foreign aggressive forces have tried every means to undermine this peaceful resolution. The Lhasa authorities in Tibet sent a delegation to set off from Lhasa in early February of this year, arriving in Calcutta, India, in early April. The British government deliberately delayed issuing visas for the Lhasa delegation to pass through Hong Kong, preventing them from coming to Beijing. According to various sources, during the Lhasa delegation's stay in India, British High Commissioner to New Delhi, Mr. Nye, and other foreign imperialists did their best to advise the delegation not to reach any agreement with our Central People's Government. It was not until August 12, when the Indian government saw that the actions of our government and army to advance into Tibet were about to begin, that it indicated to our government that the British government had revoked its refusal to issue visas to the Tibetan delegation and that the delegation had the convenience to depart for Beijing. However, more than two months have passed, and there is still no sign of them arriving. It can be seen that the Lhasa delegation's delay in coming to Beijing for negotiations is due to foreign instigation and obstruction, and the latter should be held responsible for obstructing and undermining these negotiations. As long as the local authorities in Tibet correct their past mistakes and abandon the erroneous stance of relying on foreign forces to reject the People's Liberation Army's advance, the Tibetan issue can still be resolved peacefully, but the obstruction and provocation of foreign governments must be guarded against by the Tibetan people.

The Chinese and Indian people, who have shared the same fate and interests for a long time, are full of goodwill towards each other. The unity and cooperation of the 800 million people of China and India is enough to stabilize Asia and jointly resist imperialist aggression. However, imperialists are afraid of the development of friendship between the Chinese and Indian people. They are painstakingly trying to undermine the desire of the Indian and Chinese people to unite and seek liberation together. Therefore, they use the Tibetan issue to confuse Indian public opinion, vainly attempting to use this to alienate the great friendship between the Chinese and Indian people. Since the Indian government has reiterated that it has no ambitions for Tibet and expressed its importance to the friendship between the two peoples, it should respect the legitimate actions of the Chinese government in exercising sovereignty over Tibet and allow the Indian people to fully understand the legitimate position of the Chinese people on the issue of liberating Tibet. Only in this way can we consolidate the correct path of relations between the two countries.

### 中国人民解放西藏是不容干涉的

　　中国人民解放西藏是不容干涉的
    奉命进军西藏的人民解放军，已于十月十九日解放西康西部重镇昌都，打开了通往西藏的孔道。人民解放军的这一伟大行动，目的在于解放西藏同胞，驱逐帝国主义的侵略势力，完成统一祖国的大业，保卫和建设我西部边疆，维护世界和平。因此，进军西藏的人民解放军，得到了康藏同胞的热烈欢迎，全中国人民的热烈拥护，和全世界爱好和平人民的热烈同情。对于这样的正义行动，印度政府竟然企图加以阻止，不能不使中国人民感到惊异和遗憾。
    西藏是中国领土的组成部分，正像南威尔斯是英国的组成部分，孟买是印度的组成部分一样。远在一千三四百年以前，西藏便与中国内地建立了密切的关系，而自一七九四年开始，西藏便正式地成为中国的一部分。但是，外国帝国主义者却不断地觊觎中国这一西部疆域。英国在侵占印度以后，便进一步企图攫取西藏，在一八八七年和一九○四年，曾两次发动对于西藏的武装侵略。外国侵略者勾结西藏的反动分子，采取政治的、经济的种种方法，残酷地剥削和压迫西藏人民，曾经激起西藏人民的强烈的反抗。在中国人民解放战争赢得了划时代的胜利以后，美英帝国主义继续派遣间谍进入西藏，并加强对于西藏反动当局的军事援助，图谋阻止西藏回到伟大的中华祖国的怀抱。西藏是中国的领土，我中央人民政府当然有解放西藏和守卫西藏的神圣责任。这种纯属我国内政的问题，凡是尊重中国领土主权的国家，当然不应有任何干涉。
    印度政府企图把人民解放军向西藏进军的行动和中央人民政府和平解决西藏问题的愿望对立起来，这是完全违背事实的。事实上西藏问题的和平解决，不但不能妨碍人民解放军的进军，而且必须以和平接受人民解放军进军为条件。我中央人民政府过去和现在一直坚持和平解决西藏问题，但外国侵略势力却千方百计破坏这种和平解决。西藏拉萨当局派出代表团于本年二月初由拉萨启程，四月初即抵达印度加尔各答。英国政府故意迟不发给拉萨代表团路过香港的签证，使他们不能前来北京。据各方消息，在拉萨代表团滞留印度期间，英国驻新德里高级专员奈氏和其他外国帝国主义分子，曾竭力劝告代表团不与我中央人民政府取得任何协议。直到八月十二日，印度政府见到我政府我军进军西藏的行动即将开始，乃向我政府表示：英国政府已撤销拒发西藏代表团签证之举，该代表团已有动身来北京的方便。但时隔两个多月，仍然是只闻楼梯响，不见人下来。可见拉萨代表团的迟迟不来北京进行和谈，是因为受到外国的唆使和阻挠，后者应负阻碍和破坏这一和谈的责任。只要西藏地方当局力改前非，放弃依靠外国势力拒绝人民解放军进军的错误立场，西藏问题仍然可以和平解决，但是外国政府的阻挠和挑拨，是西藏人民所必须警惕的。
    在长期间命运相同利害与共的中国人民和印度人民，是互相充满善意的，中印两国八万万人民的团结合作，足以稳定亚洲而共同对抗帝国主义的侵略。但是帝国主义者害怕中印人民友谊的发展，他们处心积虑要破坏印度人民与中国人民联合一致共求解放的愿望，因此就利用西藏问题来迷惑印度的舆论，妄想借此离间中印人民的伟大友谊。印度政府既然重申对于西藏没有任何野心，并表示重视两国人民的友谊，就应当尊重中国政府对于西藏行使主权的正当行动，并且让印度人民充分了解中国人民对于解放西藏问题的正当立场。只有这样，才是巩固两国邦交的正确途径。
