　　Britain's Deepening Quagmire in Malaya
　　Military Setbacks and Financial Difficulties
Xinhua News Agency, 13th. According to a Reuter's dispatch from Singapore on the 10th: The British colonial government in Malaya has recently added 22 million Malayan dollars to its budget to fight against the Malayan National Liberation Army. The Malayan war expenditure budget for this year has now reached more than 158 million Malayan dollars, and the fiscal deficit has therefore reached 73 million dollars. These figures were released after British Commander-in-Chief in Malaya, Brigadier Briggs, was recalled to London. Britain's war in Malaya has recently suffered further setbacks. When British High Commissioner for Southeast Asia, MacDonald, spoke of the war against the Malayan National Liberation Army, he said: The war in Malaya is becoming more and more difficult and slow.
