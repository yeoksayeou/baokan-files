　　Internationalist Solidarity of the Chinese and Korean Peoples in the Northeast Anti-Japanese War
　　Guan Monan
    In the fourteen-year War of Resistance Against Japan, the blood of Korean patriotic volunteers flowed together with the blood of the Chinese people. Korean communists and patriots deeply understood that the liberation of their motherland and the liberation of the Chinese people were inseparable, and that the Chinese and Korean peoples could only defeat Japanese imperialism by establishing a united anti-Japanese front. With this understanding, the people of the two countries were closely united in the fourteen-year War of Resistance Against Japan, becoming a model of revolutionary friendship and cooperation among colonial peoples in the world.
    In Northeast China, Korean patriots participated in the anti-Japanese struggle very early. In 1931, in Harbin, there was an incident in which Korean patriots attacked the Japanese consulate; at the same time, a major riot occurred in the Yanbian area on the "May 30th" anniversary; on August 19th, a major riot occurred along the railway line in Dunhua, Jilin; and in October, Koreans in Kaiyuan attacked the Kaiyuan Public Security Bureau. The early anti-Japanese guerrilla warfare in the Northeast, in many areas, relied on the foundation of activities by Korean comrades and was launched with Korean comrades as the backbone. The Korean Independence Army, which persisted in armed anti-Japanese struggle in the Xingjing area of Liaodong Province, the Korean independence activists hiding in the deep forests of Changbai Mountain, and the anti-Japanese people in the Yanbian area all joined the anti-Japanese struggle together with the Chinese people.
    Japanese imperialism was constantly trying to undermine such close unity between the Chinese and Korean peoples. It tried to make the Chinese and Korean nations hate each other and conspired to undermine the anti-Japanese united front of the two nations through the activities of spies. The Northeast Committee of the Chinese Communist Party continuously exposed the provocations of Japanese imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries and opposed the Korean People's Association, a tool of the Japanese invaders. At that time, the peasant committees and people's revolutionary governments in various places under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party were established by the Chinese and Korean peoples. Whether it was the First, Second, or Third Route Armies of the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army or underground secret activities, comrades from both sides worked together. In particular, the First Route Army of the Anti-Japanese United Army was formerly the Panshi Anti-Japanese Guerrilla Force led by the Korean communist Li Hongguang. This guerrilla force was established in the spring of 1932 after the Panshi Central County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party launched a major anti-Japanese riot by the Chinese and Korean peoples in Hamahezi. Later, the East Manchuria Guerrilla Force (formed by merging the guerrilla forces of Yanji, Wangqing, Helong, and Huichun counties), most of whom were Korean, was also incorporated into the First Route Army.
    In the Anti-Japanese United Army, the deeds of the sincere friendship between Chinese and Korean comrades are worthy of being passed down for generations. In 1936, after the formal establishment of the Anti-Japanese United Army, Commander-in-Chief of the First Route Army, Yang Jingyu, restrained the Japanese army from behind, cooperating with General Kim Il-sung to lead the Sixth Division into North Korea. In 1939, Yang Jingyu's troops were surrounded. In order to break the difficult situation, he went to Huadian to hold a meeting with Cui Xian (a Korean comrade), the commander of the Third Front Army. Korean comrade Han Renhe (staff officer) risked leading a team to lure the enemy, so that the meeting could be successfully opened. At that time, Yang Jingyu, Kim Il-sung, Li Hongguang, Han Guang, Cui Xian, and other Korean comrades were as close as brothers. Before being surrounded, Yang Jingyu handed over the team to General Kim Il-sung and others to lead away. After Yang Jingyu was killed, Kim Il-sung, Cui Xian, and Han Renhe vowed to fight for revenge. In 1943 and 1944, the comrades of the First Route Army closely united around General Kim Il-sung, and the troops under An Jiyi (a Korean comrade) went underground.
    Korean female comrades were very brave and resolute in the anti-Japanese guerrilla warfare. In the heroic incident of "Eight Women Throwing Themselves into the River," there were Korean female comrades. The famous Korean female hero of East Liaoning, Comrade Jin Dongshan, once went to Yanji from Helong with her lover Jiang Zhezhi to do liaison work, but was discovered and pursued by the enemy. Although Jiang Zhe was sheltered by local Chinese residents, he was eventually captured by the enemy and died as a result. Later, Jin Dongshan joined the armed struggle. She once subverted enemy trains in Habaling and captured nine enemy bandits. Later, she was arrested while going to the mountains to establish a clothing factory. The Japanese invaders used severe torture to extract confessions but gained nothing, and planned to send her to Ning'an to be killed. Jin Dongshan escaped from prison but was unfortunately captured again on the way. The enemy inflicted various tortures on her, even cutting off her feet, but Comrade Dongshan resolutely refused to make any confessions. Seeing that Jin Dongshan was dying, the enemy prepared to cremate her, but she was bought out by comrades on the way. Now, although she has lost her feet, she is still serving in Yanbian for production and construction.
    The deeds of the Korean people's moving and weeping bloody struggle on the land of Northeast China are truly countless. When Comrade Li Guanglin led his team to Erdaochezi in Ning'an, they were surrounded by an enemy army ten times their size. They fought hard for two days and nights, ran out of ammunition, and exhausted their strength. The entire team shouted slogans and died heroically, with no one surrendering. The wife of Lin Deshan, the political commissar of the Fourth Regiment of the Fourth Army of the Anti-Japanese United Army, and the lover of Ye Yude, the political commissar of the First Division concurrently of the Fourth Army, fell behind during the march and encountered the enemy. They would rather throw themselves into the Mudan River together and die than be captured. Today, many of the leaders of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea are anti-Japanese heroes who were in the Northeast in those years. The internationalist solidarity and friendship between the Chinese and Korean peoples have historical roots. Now that the Korean people are suffering from the fierce aggression of American imperialism, we cannot but strongly oppose it and give brotherly care to the Korean people.

　　中朝人民在东北抗日战争中的国际主义团结
　　关沫南
    在十四年的抗日战争中，朝鲜爱国志士的鲜血曾和中国人民的鲜血流在一起的。朝鲜的共产党人和爱国者深知自己祖国的解放和中国人民的解放是不可分的，中、朝人民只有建立起一个抗日的统一战线，才能战胜日本帝国主义。在这样的认识下，两国人民在十四年的抗日战争中，亲密团结，成为世界上殖民地人民革命友谊合作的模范。
    在东北，朝鲜爱国者很早就参加了抗日斗争。一九三一年，在哈尔滨，曾有朝鲜爱国者袭击日本领事馆事件；同时“五卅”纪念日，间岛地区发生大暴动；八月十九日，吉林敦化铁路沿线发生大暴动；十月，开原的朝鲜人袭击开原公安局。东北初期的抗日游击战争，在很多地区都是依靠朝鲜同志活动的基础、以朝鲜同志为骨干发动起来的。辽东省兴京一带坚持抗日武装斗争的朝鲜独立军，隐藏在长白山深林中的朝鲜独立运动者，间岛一带的抗日人民，都曾纷纷和中国人民一起参加抗日。
    对于中、朝人民这样的亲密团结，日本帝国主义是无时无刻不设法破坏的。它力图使中、朝民族相互仇视，并且阴谋以奸细活动来破坏两民族的抗日统一战线。中共东北党委曾不断揭露日本帝国主义与国民党反动派的挑拨离间，反对日寇的工具——朝鲜民会。当时，在中国共产党领导下的各地农民委员会、人民革命政府都是中、朝人民建立起来的。无论东北抗日联军一、二、三路军或地下秘密活动，都由两方同志协力来做。特别是抗日联军中的第一路军，它的前身就是朝鲜共产党人李红光领导的盘石反日游击队。这个游击队是在一九三二年春，中国共产党盘石中心县委于蛤蚂河子发动中、朝人民反日大暴动后成立的。以后，大部为朝鲜人的东满游击队（由延吉、汪清、和龙、晖春四县游击队合并而成）也并入了一路军。
    在抗日联军中，中、朝同志的精诚友爱的事迹是值得万世传诵的。一九三六年，抗日联军正式成立后，一路军总指挥杨靖宇同志在背后牵制日军，配合金日成将军带领第六师打入北朝鲜。一九三九年，杨靖宇部队被围，为了打开艰难局面，曾去桦甸与三方面军指挥崔贤（朝鲜同志）举行会议。朝鲜同志韩仁和（参谋）不惜冒险带队诱敌，使会议得以开成功。当时杨靖宇同志和金日成、李红光、寒光、崔贤等朝鲜同志都是亲如手足的。杨靖宇同志在被围前，将队伍交金日成将军等带开。杨靖宇遇难后，金日成、崔贤、韩仁和曾誓为其复仇而战。一九四三、四四年，一路军同志紧密地团结在金日成将军周围，与安吉亦（朝鲜同志）所部转入地下活动。
    朝鲜女同志在抗日游击战争中，是非常英勇坚决的。在“八女投江”的壮烈事件中，就有朝鲜女同志。东边道著名朝鲜女英雄金东山同志，一次与其爱人姜哲自和龙去延吉做联络工作，被敌人发觉追捕。姜哲虽获得当地中国居民掩护，终被敌人捕获，因而殉难。以后金东山即参加了武装斗争。她曾在哈尔巴岭颠覆敌人列车，俘获敌寇九名。以后，她在去山里建立被服厂时被捕，日寇用重刑逼供无所得，拟送宁安杀害。金东山越狱逃走，不幸在中途又被捕回。敌人施以各种重刑，甚至砍断她的双足，但东山同志始终坚决地不作任何招供。敌人看到金东山已垂死，准备将她火葬，途中被同志用钱买出。现在，她虽然已经失去了双足，但仍在延边为生产建设服务。
    朝鲜人民在东北的大地上可歌可泣的流血斗争的事迹实在是不胜枚举的。李光林同志在率队去宁安二道河子时，被十倍于我之敌军包围，苦战两昼夜，弹尽力竭，全队高呼口号就义，无一投降。抗日联军四军四团政治部林德山之妻及四军兼一师政委叶玉德同志的爱人，在行军中掉队遇敌，宁可一同投牡丹江殉难，而不愿被俘。今天，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国国家的领袖中，就有许多是当年在东北的抗日英雄。中朝人民的国际主义团结友爱，在历史上是有其根源的。现在朝鲜人民遭受美国帝国主义凶恶侵略，我们不能不力加反对，并对朝鲜人民给予兄弟般的关心。
