Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 1st: People's organizations in the Central South Region and Wuhan have issued statements one after another, protesting against the US imperialists' expansion of the war of aggression against Korea, their provocations against our country, and their insane acts of aggression in repeatedly violating our country's airspace and territorial waters.

　　The Preparatory Committee of the Central South Federation of Trade Unions, representing three million workers in the region, said in its protest letter: "Today we are actively producing for peace, consolidating national defense, and strengthening domestic economic construction. Tomorrow, we will also have enough strength and courage to stand at the forefront of the struggle to defend our motherland." The Preparatory Committee of the Federation of Trade Unions also called on all workers to launch a patriotic competition, actively support the struggle of the Korean people, and fight to defeat the American imperialist aggressors!

　　The Central South Democratic Women's Federation and the Wuhan Women's Federation pointed out in their protest letters: "The tears of women all over the world, whose sons and husbands were taken away by fascist bandits in World War II, have not yet dried. Chinese women have fresh memories of the atrocities of Japanese imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries. The US imperialists, disregarding the warnings of peace-loving people, continue to expand their acts of aggression, causing unprecedented humiliation to Korean women. This has aroused deeper anger and hatred among women. We cannot tolerate the beastly acts of the US imperialists. From now on, we will spare no effort to dedicate our strength and give those imperialists who attempt to destroy the happiness of children and mothers a devastating blow."

　　The Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, the Student Union, the Democratic Youth Federation, the Federation of Literary and Art Circles, and the Hubei Provincial Branch of the China Democratic League also unanimously stated that they would redouble their efforts in work and study diligently, taking practical actions to stop the American imperialist aggression. They also sent telegrams to the United Nations protesting and demanding that the Security Council immediately take effective measures to sanction the American imperialists' crimes of aggression.

　　中南区和武汉各团体声明
    我们有勇气保卫祖国
    【新华社汉口一日电】中南区和武汉市各人民团体，纷纷发表声明，抗议美帝国主义扩大侵朝战争向我国挑衅，及屡次侵犯我国领空领海的疯狂侵略行为。
    中南总工会筹委会代表全区三百万工人，在抗议书中说：“今天我们为着和平积极生产，巩固国防和加强国内经济建设，明天也将有足够的力量与勇气站在为保卫祖国斗争的最前线。”该总工会筹委会并号召全体工人展开爱国主义的竞赛，积极支援朝鲜人民的斗争，为击退美帝国主义侵略强盗而奋斗！
    中南民主妇联、武汉市妇联在抗议书中指出：“全世界妇女在第二次大战中，被法西斯强盗夺去了儿子和丈夫的泪痕未干，中国妇女对日本帝国主义和国民党反动派的暴行记忆犹新，美帝已不顾和平人民的警告，继续扩大侵略的行为，使朝鲜妇女遭受到空前凌辱，这更引起妇女深沉的愤怒和仇恨，我们对美帝的兽行，是不能容忍的，今后将不惜一切，献出自己力量，给那些企图毁灭孩子和母亲幸福的帝国主义者以毁灭性的打击。”
    中国新民主主义青年团武汉市工委、学生联合会、民主青年联合会，文联、湖北省民盟支部也一致表示要百倍地加紧工作，努力学习，以实际行动来制止美帝侵略行为。并致电联合国抗议，要求安理会立即采取有效措施，制裁美帝国主义的侵略罪行。
