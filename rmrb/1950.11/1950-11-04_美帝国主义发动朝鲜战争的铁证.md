The US imperialists, through their diplomats in the Lee Seung-man puppet government, the massive US military advisory group, the illegal "United Nations Commission on Korea," and various officials and envoys, directed and participated in all the nefarious activities of the Lee Seung-man puppet regime. When the Korean People's Army liberated Seoul, the US embassy burned important secret documents and fled in disarray. However, the Lee Seung-man puppet government was caught off guard, and all the important documents were left intact in the "Presidential Palace," where they were seized by the Korean People's Army. These documents tell the people of the world: who was the mastermind behind the Korean War; and also reveal the movements of the United States after its invasion of Korea. Below are four of the hundreds of "top secret documents."

1.  Lee Seung-man's puppet government's ambassador to the United States, Chang Myon, stated in a report to Lee Seung-man: he had met with Walton Butterworth, Director of the Far Eastern Affairs Department of the US State Department. Butterworth pointed out that after Lee Seung-man's personal envoy, Cho Pyong-ok, visited the United States, his talks with representatives of the United Nations member states and Austin regarding the US providing more aid to the "Republic of Korea" in order to invade North Korea, etc., were very inappropriate.

From this document, it can be seen that Butterworth was obviously afraid of exposing their plan to invade Korea. At the same time, it also implies that the US government had already made full preparations for assisting Lee Seung-man and his gang, and there was no need for Lee Seung-man's bandits to babble.

2.  This is a letter from Yoon Byung-koo, advisor to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and advisor to the Public Information Office of the Lee Seung-man puppet government, to Lee Seung-man on December 3, 1948. In this letter, he exposed a vicious plan of aggression concocted by US imperialism and the Lee Seung-man group, namely, the joint action of the US, Japanese, South Korean, and Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops to attack northern Korea, northeastern China, Shandong, and Soviet Siberia, to create a "victorious conclusion" for the "future of Asia." The letter specified that the US should command the US, Japanese, Chiang, and Lee forces to advance in three routes: "The Japanese army would attack towards Vladivostok in the direction of the Northeast; the US-Lee allied forces would occupy northern Korea and then attack the Liaodong Peninsula, directly to Harbin; and the Chinese Kuomintang Chiang Kai-shek bandit army would 'recover lost territories,' including the Shandong Peninsula." At the end of the letter, Yoon Byung-koo specifically told Lee Seung-man that the "Asian Plan" mentioned in this letter should not be easily disclosed, for fear that it would become a target of attack and ridicule by the "enemy." However, Yoon Byung-koo's warning was superfluous. Not only was the "plan" leaked, but the "top secret documents" also fell into the hands of the Korean people.

3.  On June 20, 1950, five days before the outbreak of the Korean War, US State Department advisor and warmonger Dulles inspected the trenches of the "38th parallel," gave speeches to Lee Seung-man's officers and soldiers, and after carrying out multiple instigations and provocations, he specially sent Lee Seung-man a copy of his own "great work" - "War or Peace?" At the same time, he also wrote a letter encouraging Lee Seung-man to carry out a civil war. In the letter, he said: "I think it (referring to that book) will express that my ideas are very similar to yours regarding the nature of the struggle we are engaged in, and you will see that I often mention Korea in my book. I attach great importance to the decisive role that your country will play in the great drama that is about to open." Below is the inscription on the book that Dulles gave to Lee Seung-man.

4.  This military strategic plan map of the US imperialists and the Lee Seung-man bandits plotting the "Northern Expedition" was seized by the Korean People's Army from the Lee Seung-man puppet army headquarters when they liberated Seoul.

This map fully illustrates the plan of the US-Lee bandits to attack North Korea. This plan shows: the South Korean First Army should launch military operations against North Korea between the Yellow Sea coast and Goranpo-ri, and the Second Army between Goranpo-ri and the east coast. The mission of the First Army is to depart from the Kaesong area and launch a main attack on Pyongyang as the right wing. The left wing would attack Sincheon in the Ongjin area, and then attack Sariwon. In addition, a landing would be carried out from Hancheon, advancing towards Pyongyang under air cover. The mission of the Second Army is to launch an attack from the Dongducheon, Chuncheon, and Hanqi areas, carry out a landing, and cut off the transportation between Pyongan and Hamgyong provinces. The map contains rows and rows of small triangles and squares, indicating the reserves concentrated in the main attack direction. On the 38th parallel are the common markings indicating the positions where the attacking troops are to carry out breakthrough battles.

### 美帝国主义发动朝鲜战争的铁证

　　美帝国主义发动朝鲜战争的铁证
    美帝国主义，通过它在李承晚傀儡政府的外交官、庞大的美国军事顾问团、非法的“联合国朝鲜委员会”以及各式各样的官员和特使，指挥并参加了李承晚傀儡政权的各种罪恶活动。在朝鲜人民军解放汉城时，美国使馆将重要的秘密文件烧毁后落荒而逃，但李承晚傀儡政府却措手不及，全部重要文件完整的放在“总统府”里，被朝鲜人民军全部缴获。这些文件告诉了全世界人民：谁是发动朝鲜战争的元凶；同时还表明了美国侵占朝鲜以后的动向。下面刊出的是数百份“极密文件”中的四份。
    １、李承晚傀儡政府驻美大使张勉在致李承晚的报告中称：他曾与美国国务院远东司司长白德华面谈，白氏指出李承晚私人特使赵炳玉访美后，对联合国各会员国代表及奥斯汀谈及美国应对“大韩民国”给予更多的援助，以便进犯北朝鲜等语是很不妥善的。
    由此文件中可以看出白德华显然唯恐暴露他们的侵朝计划，同时还暗示美国政府对李承晚的援助，早已有了充分的准备，无须李承晚匪帮饶舌。
    ２、这是一九四八年十二月三日李承晚傀儡政府外务部顾问兼公报处顾问尹炳求给李承晚的信，在这一封信里，他暴露了美帝和李承晚集团合谋的一项恶毒的侵略计划，即以美国、日本、南朝鲜及蒋匪军队联合行动进攻朝鲜北部、我国东北、山东及苏联西伯利亚，为“亚洲的未来”打出一个“胜利结局”。这封信指明要以美国统率美、日、蒋、李部队分三路进兵，“日军向东北方向攻过海参崴；美李联军占领朝鲜北部后，向辽东半岛进攻，直打至哈尔滨；中国国民党蒋匪军则“收复失地”，包括山东半岛在内。”信后，尹炳求特别告诉李承晚，这封信里所谈到的“亚洲计划”，不能轻易泄露，恐怕成为“敌人”攻击与嘲笑的目标。但是，尹炳求的警告是多余的。不但“计划”泄露了，而且“极密信件”也落到朝鲜人民手里来了。
    ３、一九五○年六月二十号，朝鲜战争爆发的前五天，美国国务院的顾问，战争贩子杜勒斯曾视察了“三八线”的战壕，向李承晚的官兵训了话，作了多次的煽动和挑拨工作后，还特地送了李承晚一本他自己的“大著”——《战争乎？和平乎？》同时还写了一封鼓励李承晚进行内战的信，在信中他说：“我想它（指那一本书）将表示对于我们所进行的斗争的性质，我与你的意念是很相同的，而且你将看到，我在我的书中时常提到朝鲜。我很重视你的国家在即将开幕的伟大的戏剧中所扮演的决定性角色。”下面是杜勒斯送给李承晚那本书上的题字。
    ４、这张美帝国主义者与李承晚匪帮策划“北伐”的军事战略计划地图，是朝鲜人民军于解放汉城时，在李承晚伪军陆军本部缴获的。
    这份地图充分说明了美李匪帮进攻北朝鲜的计划。这项计划显示：南朝鲜第一军应在黄海海岸及高浪浦里之间向北朝鲜发动军事行动，第二军在高浪浦里与东海岸之间。第一军部队的任务是从开城地区出发，作为右翼，向平壤进行主攻。左翼向瓮津地区进攻信川，随后再进攻沙里院。此外并从汉川进行登陆，在空军掩护下向平壤推进。第二军的任务是自东豆川、春川与汉奇地区发动进攻，进行登陆，并切断平安道与咸镜南北道的交通。地图中有整排整排的小三角形和四方形，显示着集中在主攻方向上的后备队。在三八线上的则是标明攻击部队要进行突破战斗的位置的常用记号。
