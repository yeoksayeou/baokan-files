　　Jilin Railway Trade Union Delegation
    Extends Condolences to Workers Participating in the Resist America, Aid Korea Transport Work
    [Our Newspaper] The Jilin District Committee and Branch Committees of the Railway Trade Union convened a meeting of grassroots labor protection committee members in the Jilin area on November 14 to discuss how to extend condolences to workers from Jilin who voluntarily went to Meihekou, Tonghua, Ji'an, and Linjiang to participate in the transport work to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes and defend our country. After the meeting, a condolence delegation was organized to first visit the families of the workers. Some family members entrusted the condolence delegation to bring cotton clothes, money, and letters instructing their husbands to step up production and ensure transportation safety.
    The condolence delegation, consisting of four people, departed from Jilin on the 17th. When socks, towels, soap, and other condolence items were distributed to the workers, they were greatly encouraged. They expressed their determination to redouble their efforts to ensure the better completion of the sacred task of resisting America, aiding Korea, protecting our homes, and defending our country.

    慰问参加抗美运输工作的职工
    【本报讯】铁路工会吉林区委员会和分区委员会在十一月十四日召开了吉林地区基层劳保委员会议，讨论如何慰问由吉林去梅河口、通化、辑安、临江各地志愿参加抗美援朝保家卫国运输工作的职工们。会后组织慰问团，先访问了职工家属。有的家属托慰问团捎棉衣、钱，和嘱咐丈夫加紧生产，保证运输安全的信。
    该慰问团一行四人，于十七日由吉林出发。当袜子、毛巾、肥皂等慰问品发到职工们手中时，他们受到了很大的鼓舞。纷纷表示要加倍努力，保证更好地完成抗美援朝保家卫国的神圣任务。
