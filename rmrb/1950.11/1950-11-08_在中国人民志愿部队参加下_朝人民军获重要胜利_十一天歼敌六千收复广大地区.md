　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Korea, 7th dispatch: According to a broadcast from Sinuiju Radio Station: The General Headquarters of the Korean Democratic People's Republic People's Army has just released a communique stating: The Republic's People's Army has recently achieved an important victory in its operations in northwestern Korea. During this operation, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army to Resist America and Aid Korea and Protect the Homeland participated. This volunteer army, under the unified command of the People's Army General Headquarters, participated in the operation alongside the People's Army. With the participation of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, the People's Army crushed four divisions of the Lee Seung-man bandit army's Second Corps and a part of the U.S. military in the Onjong and Unsan areas, forcing the American invading army and the Lee Seung-man bandit army in that sector to flee south of the Chongchon River. In the four days of battle from November 1st to 4th, according to incomplete statistics, the People's Army killed and wounded a total of 1,480 enemy troops, captured over 1,800 enemy troops, and seized 22 howitzers, 23 anti-tank guns, 20 mortars, 16 rocket launchers, 4 60mm mortars, 33 recoilless rifles, 2 anti-aircraft guns, 31 heavy machine guns, 21 light machine guns, 313 submachine guns, over 190 rifles, 290 vehicles, 17 tanks, 4 aircraft, and 2 radio stations; in addition, 3 enemy aircraft and 12 tanks were destroyed, and 2 enemy aircraft were damaged.

　　In the eleven days of battle from October 25th to November 4th, the People's Army killed and wounded over 460 U.S. troops and 2,180 Lee bandit troops, captured 270 U.S. troops and 3,778 Lee bandit troops; a total of over 6,680 U.S. and Lee bandit troops were killed or captured; 1,295 various guns, 295 various artillery pieces, and 560 vehicles were seized, 4 aircraft were captured, 3 aircraft were destroyed, and 2 aircraft were damaged, and many other war materials were seized.

　　Prior to this, the U.S. invading army and the Lee bandit army, after invading Pyongyang, continued to advance north. On the western front, one route had invaded Anshi-dong, southeast of Sinuiju, and the other route had invaded Chushan on the south bank of the mid-section of the Yalu River. With the participation of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, the People's Army launched a fierce counterattack against the enemy on the western front on October 25th; on the same day, a battalion of the Lee bandit army's 6th Division was annihilated in Liangshuidong, northwest of Onjong; on the 29th, two battalions each of the Lee bandit army's 6th and 8th Divisions were annihilated between Heecheon and Onjong, while a regiment of the Lee bandit army's 6th Division was basically annihilated in the Guchang area south of Chushan. By this point, the Lee bandit army's 6th Division had been largely annihilated. On October 31st, the People's Army annihilated parts of the Lee bandit army's 7th and 8th Divisions in the Quchang area, and on November 2nd, occupied Unsan, annihilating parts of the U.S. Cavalry 1st Division and the Lee bandit army's 1st Division. After these battles, the People's Army has recovered the cities of Chushan, Heecheon, Unsan, Taechon, Nyongbyon, Icheon, Tokchon, Nyongwon, and their surrounding vast areas, advancing the battle line to the south of the Chongchon River. The morale of the U.S. military and the Lee bandit army was very low during the fighting, collapsing at the first touch, resulting in a large number of heavy weapons falling into the hands of the People's Army. The morale of the People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army is extremely high, and the Korean and Chinese fighters are united and close as brothers. The commanders and fighters of the People's Army are determined to continue to advance and continue to annihilate the American invading army and the Lee bandit army.
