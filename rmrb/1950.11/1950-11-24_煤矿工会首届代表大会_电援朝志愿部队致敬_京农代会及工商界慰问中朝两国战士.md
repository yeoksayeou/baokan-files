Xinhua News Agency, 21st - The first congress of the China Coal Miners' Union today passed a telegram to pay respects to the glorious Chinese People's Volunteer Army. The text of the telegram is as follows: To the glorious comrades of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army:

　　Your heroic spirit of resisting America and aiding Korea to protect our homes and defend our country demonstrates to the world the great will of the Chinese people to resolutely defend their victorious achievements and world peace. Your brilliant victory is not only decisive for the survival of the Chinese and Korean nations, but also of great significance to the safety of Asian nations and the world. Our 450,000 coal miners across the country have been organized and mobilized. In addition to launching a patriotic labor competition across the country to protect our homes and defend our country, and using intensified production and increased coal production to support you through practical work of air defense, anti-espionage, fire prevention, and theft prevention, we are ready to put down our picks and take up guns to fight alongside you, eliminate the enemy, and achieve victory at any time. Finally, on behalf of all the miners in China, we pay you the highest respect.

　　November 21, 1950

[This newspaper reports] The Beijing Farmers' Representative Conference and the Industry and Commerce Circles' Committee for the Defense of Peace and Opposition to Aggression, on behalf of the farmers in the suburbs of Beijing and the practitioners in the industry and commerce circles, respectively, expressed their sympathy and support to our People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army, who are fighting shoulder to shoulder against the US aggressors.

The Beijing Farmers' Representative Conference telegraphed our People's Aid-Korea Volunteer Army, stating: American imperialism's invasion of Korea is a preparation for further invasion of our country. In order to protect the survival and safety of the people of the whole country, you resolutely went to the front line to fight side by side with the Korean people to resist the American imperialist invading army. This is your glory, and it is also the glory of all the Chinese people! We swear to do our best to support you—to do a good job in production, enrich our economic strength, consolidate social order, and continue to follow you in fighting to defend the security of the motherland and world peace! We wish you courage in killing the enemy!

The Beijing business community stated in a letter of sympathy to our People's Volunteer Army: Your high patriotic enthusiasm and your brave fighting will make us admire and thank you. We sincerely support your great voluntary actions and are willing to contribute all our strength to support you. In a letter of sympathy to the Korean People's Army, it said: Under the leadership of General Kim Il-sung, your struggle to resolutely resist the American invading army and the Syngman Rhee gang in order to strive for the liberation and reunification of the Korean people has won the sympathy and support of the people all over the world. All the industrialists and businessmen in the capital of China have unanimously expressed their intention to take effective actions to support you. I hope you will continue to bravely eliminate the invaders until the final victory is won.
