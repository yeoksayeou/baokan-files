Xinhua News Agency, 21st Dispatch:

The land reform in the suburbs of Beijing began in mid-October 1949 and ended victoriously at the end of March 1950 after five and a half months. The land reform in the suburbs was carried out under leadership, with planning, organization, and step-by-step implementation. Because the masses had been adequately mobilized beforehand and the people's revolutionary war had achieved a basic victory on the mainland, the process went relatively smoothly with fewer deviations.

I. General Land Relations Before Land Reform

The suburbs included seven districts, a total of 264 villages, ten suburbs, and six towns, with a population of 640,000 and a total cultivated land area of 1,105,800 mu.

The general land situation in the suburbs before the land reform was largely the same as in general rural areas across the country. In terms of land ownership, landlords in the outer suburbs owned more land than those in the inner suburbs. In the outer suburbs, we take seven villages—Huaifang, Bagou, Liulangzhuang, Beiwu, Longhe, Xiaohongmen, and Jixiancun—as examples. These seven villages had a population of 14,537 and 29,729 mu of land. Landlords, accounting for 7.8% of the population, owned 44.1% of the total land, while poor and landless peasants, accounting for 44.4% of the population, owned only 9.3% of the total land. In the inner suburbs, we take seven villages—Baiwanzhuang, Wuluju, Sanlihe, Yangfangdian, Dahuochezhan, Houzhuang, and Shangyuan—as examples. These seven villages had a population of 12,100 and 9,707 mu of land. Landlords, accounting for 2.1% of the population, owned 19% of the total land, while poor peasants, landless peasants and middle peasants, accounting for 57.4% of the population, owned 57.7% of the land. Moreover, whether in the outer or inner suburbs, landlords mostly owned the best land. In the aforementioned seven villages in the outer suburbs, landlords owned 65.8% of the paddy fields. In the aforementioned seven villages in the inner suburbs, landlords owned 25.5% of the irrigated land and 33.2% of the garden land. The main way landlords exploited peasants was by renting out land. In the aforementioned seven villages in the outer suburbs and seven villages in the inner suburbs, 51.2% of the landlords' land was rented out. "Upper rent" (上打租) was very common in land renting; the rent generally accounted for more than half of the peasants' annual land income. In years of poor harvest, the peasants' land income was often not enough to pay the rent.

The feudal land system in the rural areas of Beijing was inseparable from the fact that Beijing had long been the center of feudalism and imperialist rule. Some nobles and eunuchs of the Qing Dynasty, as well as notorious warlords, traitors, and bureaucrats since the Republic of China, still owned large amounts of land in the suburbs. These dignitaries mostly relied on their "housekeepers" or "second landlords" and "third landlords" to collect rent, so the feudal exploitation suffered by peasants was often two or three layers deep. The "tomb serf" system of some feudal nobles still remained. In addition to paying land rent, tomb serfs also had to guard tombs, cultivate trees in the cemetery, and add soil to the tombs on a regular basis.

On the other hand, because the rural areas of Beijing are close to the city, some situations are not present or are rare in general rural areas, such as:

1. The degree of commercialization of rural production is relatively high. The entire suburb has 24,200 mu of vegetable gardens and 110,600 mu of "three-crop" land (two crops of grain and one crop of vegetables). The vegetables from the rural areas of Beijing have always been supplied to Beijing and exported to Tianjin, Baoding, and Zhangjiakou. The cotton fields in the southern suburbs cover 40,000 to 50,000 mu, the rice paddies in the western and southern suburbs cover 23,000 mu, and the western bank of the Yongding River is rich in peanuts and sweet potatoes. Fruits, edamame, and water chestnuts from the western suburbs are all commodity production for urban needs.

Along with this commodity production is the fact that some land has begun to use simple machines or other technical equipment. For example, there are electric wells in some villages in the southern suburbs, artesian wells in the western suburbs, and rice threshers and rice hullers are widely used in the rice paddy areas. The vegetable gardens in Fengtai and outside Xizhimen are equipped with glass greenhouses, etc.

The use of machines or other scientific and technical equipment for commodity production requires huge amounts of capital to be invested in the land. The operation of these lands is generally relatively concentrated, requiring higher technology, and therefore the management methods are also more advanced.

2. Because of the close ties between urban and rural areas, some large landlords also engage in commerce or industry. Of the 4,906 landlord households in the suburbs, more than 29% also engage in commerce or industry. Among the industrial and commercial capitalists in the city, 404 households own 11,750 mu of land in the suburbs. In addition, some working people in the city also have a small amount of land in the suburbs (mostly graveyards) that they rent out, totaling approximately more than 5,500 households.

3. A large number of non-agricultural population live in rural areas. Non-agricultural population accounts for approximately 39.5% of the total population of 640,000 in the suburbs. Most of these non-agricultural populations live in the suburbs and towns, but many also live mixed in rural areas. The aforementioned seven villages in the outer suburbs have a non-agricultural population of 10%. The aforementioned seven villages in the inner suburbs have a non-agricultural population of 38.1%. Most of these non-agricultural populations are vegetable vendors and other small merchants, various small handicraft workers, rickshaw pullers, and the poor. Many of them do not have fixed jobs and their lives are often in a state of semi-starvation.

4. Beijing is the capital of the people. With the development of urban industry and other construction projects, a large amount of agricultural land will be turned into urban land.

5. There are many people and little land. The entire suburb averages 1.8 mu of land per person; the inner suburbs have even less, averaging only 1.2 mu of land per person; the outer suburbs have approximately 3 mu of land per person.

Therefore, although it is necessary to abolish the feudal land system in the suburbs of Beijing as in general rural areas, land policies must have some differences from general rural areas.

II. Specific Policy Issues Regarding Land Reform in the Suburbs

The land reform in the suburbs of Beijing was carried out in accordance with the "Decision on Agricultural Land Issues in the Municipal Area" promulgated by the Beijing Military Control Commission in 1949, which is consistent with the spirit of the "Instructions on Handling Agricultural Land Issues in the Suburbs of Old Liberated Areas" promulgated by the State Council on January 13, 1950. Here, we will only discuss several specific policy issues of land reform as follows:

1.  A principle difference in land policy between the suburbs of Beijing and general areas is: land confiscated from landlords and land requisitioned from rich peasants is owned by the state, and the state distributes it to landless or land-poor peasants for use.

In order for urban industry and other construction projects to be able to use suburban land freely and rationally, to adapt to the characteristics of many people and little land in the suburbs, and to take into account that farmland cultivated with machines and advanced facilities should not be distributed, it has proven correct to transfer the confiscated feudal land to state ownership, and for the state to distribute it to peasants for use or to allow the original operators to continue operating it.

Because peasants do not pay rent for using state-owned land, and pay agricultural tax exactly the same as privately owned land, farming state land is almost the same as farming their own land; if the land is taken back to build factories, they are happy as long as they can be employed, because they see that the lives of workers are better than their own; at the same time, this can also solve the difficulty of distributing land due to the scarcity of land and satisfy the peasants' land requirements, because the land is state-owned and no one can buy or sell it. In this way, the non-agricultural population will not compete for land, and peasants can use more land. Therefore, peasants can accept this approach. Moreover, because of the peasants' trust in the Communist Party and the People's Government, there are no major concerns about cultivating on state-owned land. For example, peasants in Shuanghuaishu in the western suburbs generally apply 40% more fertilizer to the state-owned land they cultivate than when the land was in the hands of landlords, and 665 mu of dry land has been converted into paddy fields or gardens. Peasants in Huaifang Village in the southern suburbs dug three new wells and repaired one old well on the state-owned land they cultivate. Peasant Hou Gengchi in Yushuzhuang spent 15 workdays on the state-owned land he cultivates, leveling a high slope and expanding the cultivated area by half a mu. Peasant Guo Yuan in Shibalidian planted 40 trees and built several earthen houses on the state-owned land he cultivates.

2.  The policy towards rich peasants in the land reform in the suburbs of Beijing is: only the rented land of rich peasants was requisitioned, and their own cultivated land, land cultivated by hired laborers, and other properties were not touched.

The population of rich peasants in the suburbs of Beijing is 16,701. Before the land reform, they owned 88,700 mu of land, of which 22,050 mu was rented land and more than 60,000 mu was self-cultivated land.

Not touching these more than 60,000 mu of self-cultivated and hired-labor cultivated land and other properties of rich peasants has many benefits:

A. It is conducive to the early restoration of rural production. First of all, it is conducive to stabilizing and stimulating the production enthusiasm of middle peasants. This year, Shuanghuaishu Village bought eight new waterwheels, of which seven were bought by middle peasants. As middle peasant Shi Wenyuan said: "If the rich peasants are not touched, what are we worried about?" Stabilizing and stimulating the production enthusiasm of middle peasants is, in effect, encouraging the production enthusiasm of poor and landless peasants. Because generally poor and landless peasants will inevitably quickly rise to become middle peasants after land reform. Today's poor and landless peasants are tomorrow's middle peasants. At the same time, rich peasants' production tools, funds, and other production conditions are better than those of general peasants. Preserving the rich peasant economy is conducive to the restoration and development of the economy and the supply of urban vegetables.

B. It is conducive to isolating landlords. Before the land reform, the rich peasants and the landlords had the same fearful mood. Generally, the rich peasants believed that they would certainly be the target of land reform; the general peasants also thought the same way. But once the class lines were clearly drawn in the land reform, and the rich peasants learned that the policies we adopted towards them were different from those of the landlords, the rich peasants began to distance themselves from the landlords and their emotions tended to stabilize.

C. The middle peasants were resolutely protected. In the past, the most difficult thing in class demarcation in land reform was distinguishing whether the amount of exploitation exceeded 25%, that is, the boundary between rich peasants and middle peasants. Because there are many technical difficulties in calculating the amount of exploitation in agricultural production, it is easy to mistakenly classify middle peasants as rich peasants. This time, the policy of preserving the rich peasant economy was adopted, which further guaranteed that middle peasants would not be infringed upon.

(Note from the State Council: This was implemented before the promulgation of the Land Reform Law of the People's Republic of China. In the future, when land reform is implemented in the suburbs, the issue of rich peasants renting out land should be implemented in accordance with Article 6 of the Land Reform Law of the People's Republic of China.)

3. In the land reform in the suburbs of Beijing, only the landlords' land, livestock, farm tools, surplus houses, and grain were confiscated. The landlords' personal belongings and other movable properties were not touched at all. Landlords who relied on land for a living were also given the same share of land to use as peasants. Because of these specific policies towards the landlord class, the vast majority of landlords began to participate in agricultural labor after the land reform and began to turn their personal belongings and movable properties to agricultural production or industrial and commercial activities. According to the survey of 79 landlord households in Heita and Shuanghuaishu villages, except for four landlord households who moved to live in the city, only three households did not participate in agricultural labor, and 82 people from the other 62 landlord households began to participate in agricultural labor. In terms of commercial activities, landlord Hu Lianqing in Taipingqiao originally had four livestock and two carts. In the land reform, one livestock and one cart that were unrelated to the transportation industry but were connected to the feudal land were confiscated. He has now bought another mule and a rubber-wheeled cart. Landlord Hao Qinglong in Gucheng Village recently bought several shares in a coal shop in the city. Landlord Guan Dongtian in Shuanghuaishu began to sell livestock after the land reform. These are all good phenomena. A class that was completely parasitic in the past has now started a new life.

4.  The land reform adopted a policy of protecting industry and commerce, so it did not cause any fluctuations in the large and small industrial and commercial enterprises in cities, towns, and villages. On the contrary, after the confiscation and requisition of land, they felt more at ease and concentrated on operating their industrial and commercial enterprises better.

III. General Process of Land Reform

Land reform in the suburbs is generally divided into the following three steps: preparation, confiscation of land, and distribution of the fruits of struggle. These steps cannot be mechanically separated. The specific work and methods of each step are not exactly the same.

1. When the land reform work team arrives in a village, it first openly explains its intentions to everyone (including landlords). It openly tells the landlords what the People's Government's policies are towards them and warns the landlords to abide by the policies and laws of the People's Government. This can quickly mobilize peasants to carry out land reform and quickly stabilize the fears of the general public and landlords.

In this step, the most important thing is to understand the dynamics of each class, discover activists, and carry out the first specific struggle based on the most urgent demands of the majority of peasants in the village. Sixty-six villages started with the struggle against local bullies, others started with the withdrawal of "upper rent," and some started with organizing production and disaster relief. Facts have proved that in villages where land reform work is carried out based on the most urgent demands of the majority of peasants, the peasant masses are more fully mobilized and subsequent work can proceed more smoothly.

The best method for fighting local bullies is to combine mass accusations on the spot with court acceptance, which can improve the masses' courage and confidence in fighting local bullies and strengthen the relationship between the People's Government and the people. It can also make the struggle organized and orderly, and prevent random beatings and killings. In the land reform in the suburbs, a total of 130 local bullies were fought, of which 40 major local bullies were handed over to the court for handling. Other minor local bullies were not pursued after they bowed their heads to the masses. Among the 40 major local bullies, seven were sentenced to death, one to life imprisonment, 26 to fixed-term imprisonment, and six have not yet been dealt with. In this way, the general landlords did not dare to openly despise the peasants and resist the land reform.

After achieving victory in the struggle against local bullies or other struggles, the village peasant representative meeting is established. Combining the cadres of the work team with the village peasant representative meeting is the best organizational form to complete the land reform. We widely used the method of village peasant representative meetings in the first batch of most villages and the second and third batches of villages. The village peasant representative meeting generally ensured that poor and landless peasants accounted for two-thirds and middle peasants accounted for one-third. Peasants were divided into several groups by region. In order to facilitate the work team's guidance, several groups were often combined to hold meetings, which peasants called "pian'er hui." The village peasant representative meeting established on this basis has the broadest representation, and the work team's opinions can be quickly conveyed to the masses, and the masses' opinions can be quickly reflected.

2.  The second step includes two tasks: class demarcation and confiscation of landlords' land and their houses, farm tools, livestock, grain, etc. that should be confiscated. Class demarcation is an extremely important and extremely cautious issue in this step. This is the prerequisite for distinguishing between the enemy and ourselves in order to fight. Therefore:

(1) It is necessary to explain the standards for class demarcation so that everyone knows it, even the landlords should understand the class demarcation. When explaining classes, use more examples to explain what the specific policies of the People's Government are towards each class. This is most easily accepted by peasants. As long as the peasant masses understand the standards for class demarcation and the specific policies towards each class, it is not easy to make mistakes in land reform.

(2) Fully promote democracy, whoever is demarcated must be present, self-report their components, and be evaluated by the masses; if they disagree, they can debate on the spot and can file a complaint with the government. The advantage of this is that the situation is clarified on the spot, the basis is found, so that the person being demarcated is convinced, and from repeated debates with the landlords, the class consciousness of the masses can be improved. This is a successful method widely used in the land reform in the suburbs. A few villages did not grasp this spirit when demarcating classes, and made deviations, even forcing several middle peasant households to admit that they were landlords or rich peasants.

(3) Correctly distinguish between main labor and incidental labor. The most disputed issue in class demarcation in the suburbs is the distinction between main labor and incidental labor. The most difficult to distinguish in this issue is the main labor and incidental labor of gardening. Because gardening requires a variety of labor, many garden owners, in addition to hiring skilled workers, participate in watering, weeding, cutting vegetables, or marketing products in the market. These labors are an indispensable part of gardening production and are operated year-round, so these labors should be regarded as main labor. Some villages, because they did not grasp this spirit, mistakenly classified many rich peasants as landlords.

(4) The class in the rural areas of large cities suburbs cannot be demarcated simply from the perspective of general rural areas. Because rural areas in the suburbs are mixed with a large number of non-agricultural people who also have part of the land. In addition, there are people who live in urban areas but own land in the suburbs. If we do not proceed from the actual situation, we will make the mistake of classifying non-agricultural laborers and capitalists who also have a small amount of land as landlords or rich peasants, turning friends into enemies and increasing the difficulty of land reform. In the first batch of land reform, many villages made this mistake. We comprehensively inspected the work of class demarcation based on the instructions of the North China Bureau of the CPC in December 1948 on the class demarcation of land reform in Yangquan City, and quickly corrected it.

(5) In order to correctly demarcate the components of urban residents who own land in the suburbs, we adopted the following methods: educating and relying on tenants to provide materials (but we should be wary of some tenants deliberately raising the components of those who rent out land but are not landlords), the village where the land is located notifies them to come and self-report and participate in the meeting for democratic evaluation of components; or finding out the address of the land renters in the urban area, and the neighborhood office and police station assist in the investigation.

(6) Affluent middle peasants hate the word "rich" on their heads. When demarcating classes, affluent middle peasants can no longer be distinguished from middle peasants. In all the villages that have done this, the production enthusiasm of affluent middle peasants is more stable.

After the class demarcation, the work of confiscating the landlords' land, farm tools, livestock, and surplus grain and houses began. Confiscating the landlords' land means asking the landlords to hand over the land deeds. The work of confiscating the landlords' farm tools, livestock, and surplus grain and houses generally adopted an organized and orderly method of receiving. That is, the farmers' association ordered the landlords to properly keep the things that should be confiscated, make a clear list, and those who destroy or steal them will be punished. After that, the farmers' association or the representative meeting will investigate and verify the list. Except for those that should be left behind, representatives selected by the masses will organize three groups for registration, transportation, and safekeeping to receive the property at the landlords' homes. The advantage of this is that it can reduce the phenomenon of landlords destroying the property, the three groups can supervise each other to avoid some elements from taking it privately, and it will not lead to the confusion of moving general movable property.

3. The third step is to distribute the fruits of the struggle. Generally, land is distributed first. Because there are many people and little land in the suburbs, those who mainly do not rely on agricultural labor for a living in the past may not be allocated land or less land may be allocated. The main targets of land distribution are landless and land-poor peasants, and then unemployed workers and other poor people who are willing to farm. Generally, the land is divided into several grades according to yield, taking into account the distance of the land, referring to the original land quantity of the land claimants, and distributing it according to the population. Single men or households with only two people are generally calculated and distributed according to two or three people. The villages in the western suburbs drew up a map of the land that should be distributed, which solved many complex technical problems in the land distribution. This is a scientific working method. The distribution of farm tools, livestock, grain, and houses is mainly based on the two principles of taking into account the production needs of peasants and unified accounting and unified distribution, and fair matching.

Whether it is distributing land or distributing farm tools, livestock, grain, and houses, the method of self-reporting and public discussion is generally adopted. The result of self-reporting often exceeds the amount of existing fruits of struggle. At this time, the household with the lowest requirement for land or other fruits is selected as the basis, and the method of comparing households is adopted to reduce and abandon the requirements of each household one by one. After repeated iterations, the vast majority of people feel fair and reasonable, and then it is passed by the peasant congress and announced as a final decision. This makes the distribution of the fruits of struggle relatively fair and rapid, avoiding the phenomenon of everyone feeling that the land use is insufficient due to the large population and little land, or being dragged down by a small amount of land. Finally, the land use certificate is issued. In most villages in the suburbs, peasants received the land use certificate as soon as the land reform ended, which has a great effect on stabilizing the peasants' production enthusiasm. Many peasants happily said: "Private deeds rely on documents, official deeds rely on seals. With the land use certificate, farming is reliable."

Land reform is a process of mobilizing the peasant masses to rise up and struggle against the landlord class. Only by mobilizing the peasant masses can this great historical task be successfully resolved. To mobilize the masses, we must first make the masses truly understand the land policies of the People's Government so that land reform can become the action of the masses themselves. Therefore, we must use various methods to carry out extensive and in-depth propaganda and education work, and we must carry this work through every link and every specific work in the entire process of the land reform movement in order to gradually improve the peasants' awareness and policy level and make land reform a revolutionary action with leadership and order. If the masses are not mobilized and only the cadres of the work team are relied upon to carry out the work, the peasants' superiority will not be established, the landlords' arrogance will not be defeated, feudalism will not be completely eliminated, the fruits of struggle will not be distributed fairly, and many difficulties will be created in future work. Therefore, leading the peasant masses to rise up and liberate themselves is the most important experience in land reform work.

IV. Leadership Issues in Land Reform

The suburbs were able to "carry out land reform work step by step and in an orderly manner" due to the following experiences in leadership:

(1) Before land reform, policy education must be fully conducted among cadres so that cadres truly understand the policies, that is, to clear their minds, rather than just obey in organization. This time, we universally brewed the land policies in the suburbs among the cadres for several months and adopted the method of combining studying documents with land reform experimental villages. Last year, we conducted land reform experiments in seven villages and focused on checking the two main deviations in the ideological style of the cadres at that time: disorganization and indiscipline, and commandism. This is one of the main reasons why no major deviations occurred in the implementation of policies in the suburban land reform.

(2) Correctly organize the cadre force and carry out land reform work in batches. Among the 469 cadres participating in the land reform work, 135 had worked on land reform in the old areas. Because these cadres lacked land reform experience in the suburbs of large cities and in order to carry out land reform steadily, it was necessary to concentrate the use of cadres and carry out work in batches. This organizational form of concentrated use of cadres is the land reform work team. Each land reform work team consists of five to nine people. Each work team is only allowed to carry out land reform work in one administrative village in each batch. The land reform work in the suburbs was completed in three batches: the first batch of 73 villages generally took two months, the second batch of 102 villages, and the third batch of 88 villages generally took one and a half months. The biggest advantage of carrying out land reform in batches is that it is convenient for the leadership to control and prevent the phenomenon of scattering and being unable to lead and control.

(3) Make full use of modern transportation tools and resolutely implement the system of asking for instructions and reporting. Each work team reports to the district once every two or three days. Each district reports to the city by telephone every three days, and a written comprehensive report is submitted every week. If there are major events, they are reported and instructions are requested at any time. The Suburban Work Committee is also equipped with inspectors who regularly go to various villages to understand the situation and inspect the work, basically ensuring that the leadership can timely understand the situation below, good experiences can be promoted in a timely manner, and deviations can be corrected in a timely manner.

(4) We must resolutely prevent the spontaneous struggle of peasants in land reform. In the tide of the beginning of land reform, peasants in Liugezhuang, Mafangsi, and Futiansi villages spontaneously carried out land reform. The targets of spontaneous struggle in the three villages were only four landlord households (including one local bully landlord), and the others were four rich peasant households and 18 middle peasant households. Most of them first aimed at confiscating or confiscating grain, and Mafangsi also tied up and beat a landlord household. After these events occurred, we immediately instructed the districts to convene meetings of farmers' association cadres in villages where land reform had not yet begun, and clearly stipulated that before the land reform work team arrives, only policy publicity and preparatory work are allowed, and formal action is not allowed. At the same time, special personnel were sent to handle the aftermath in the villages where spontaneous action had already occurred. This ensured that land reform could be carried out in batches in accordance with our plan and in accordance with land reform policies, and stabilized the emotions of some people who had fears about land reform.

Finally, in the leadership ideology, it must be clear that whether the leadership is correct or not depends not only on whether the policies are correct but also on how the already determined policies are implemented. Therefore, the leadership must grasp that whenever a phenomenon of violating policies is encountered, it must be corrected. At the same time, when correcting deviations, it must be timely and resolute. As long as it is considered a real mistake and violates the policies, it must be corrected in a timely and resolute manner. Correcting deviations does not mean letting go or pouring cold water. Experience has proved that after timely correction of deviations, the work develops more smoothly. Some people believe that if the deviation is not a major danger, it can be ignored. This is not right.

V. Achievements of Land Reform and New Changes in Rural Areas After Land Reform

After five and a half months of intense and enthusiastic land reform work, new changes have fundamentally taken place in rural areas of the suburbs.

In the land reform in the entire suburb, a total of 400,290 mu of feudal land, 69,083 farm tools of various sizes, 1,743 livestock, 1,332,000 jin of grain, and 22,278 houses were confiscated. A total of 229,892 peasants obtained land. This means that the feudal land system that has existed for thousands of years has been completely eliminated in the suburbs of the people's capital.

In the land reform, the political consciousness of the peasants has been significantly improved. A total of 116,500 peasants in the entire suburb are organized in farmers' associations (the total agricultural population in the suburbs is 350,000). Because the peasants have turned over economically and politically, some bad habits and backward superstitious ideas that the old society instilled in the peasants have also begun to change. For example, in the past, many single landless peasants in the rice paddy area of the western suburbs drank, gambled, and prostituted. Now that they have been allocated land in the land reform, they have automatically quit all bad habits. They are carefully calculating to build a family and start a career for themselves in one or two years. After receiving the land, Grandma Guo in Nanzhuangzi Village in the southern suburbs happily said: "In the past, we worshiped Lord Guan, saying that he was responsive. Where was he responsive? In my opinion, who should we worship? We should worship our Chairman Mao!" They have high production enthusiasm and are actively striving to complete the production increase task.

    北京市人民政府关于北京郊区土地改革的总结报告
    （一九五零年十一月二十一日经中央人民政府政务院审核批准）
    京郊土地改革于一九四九年十月半开始，经过五个半月，于一九五零年三月底胜利地结束了。郊区的土地改革是有领导、有计划、有组织、有步骤地来进行的，并由于群众事先已有相当发动且又处在人民革命战争在全国大陆上已经取得基本胜利的情况下，所以进行的比较顺利而偏差较少。
     一、土地改革前的一般土地关系
    郊区所属七个区，共二百六十四个村子、十个关厢、六个镇；共有人口六十四万；共有耕地面积一百一十万五千八百亩。
    郊区土改前的一般土地情况和全国一般农村比较起来，大体是相同的。在土地占有情况上：远郊地主占有的土地量比近郊更大。在远郊，我们以槐房、巴沟、六郎庄、北坞、龙河、小红门、集贤村七个村子为例，这七个村子的人口为一万四千五百三十七人，土地为二万九千七百二十九亩，占有这七个村子人口百分之七·八的地主，却占有全部土地百分之四十四·一；占有人口百分之四十四·四的贫雇农，仅占有全部土地的百分之九·三。在近郊，我们以百万庄、五路居、三里河、羊坊店、大火车站、侯庄、上园七个村子为例，这七个村子的人口为一万二千一百人，土地为九千七百零七亩，占有这七个村子人口百分之二·一的地主，占有全部土地的百分之十九；占有人口百分之五十七·四的贫雇农和中农，占有土地百分之五十七·七。同时，不论在远郊或近郊，地主占有的多是好地。在上述远郊七个村子，地主占有稻地的百分之六十五·八。在上述近郊七个村子，地主占有水浇地的百分之二十五·五，园地的百分之三十三·二。地主剥削农民的主要方式是出租土地。在上述远郊七个村子和近郊七个村子地主土地的百分之五十一·二是出租土地。在出租土地中，“上打租”很流行；租额一般占农民常年土地收入的一半以上。如遇到歉收年，农民土地收入常常不够交租子。
    北京郊区农村的封建土地制度与北京曾长期是封建主义和帝国主义者统治的中心这一情况是分不开的。有些满清的贵族、太监，民国以来著名的军阀、汉奸、官僚在郊区仍旧占有大量的土地，这些显贵们收租多靠他们的“管家”或“二地主”、“三地主”，所以农民所受的封建剥削往往是二层或三层的。有些封建贵族的“坟奴”制度仍残存着。坟奴除交地租外，还要看守坟墓，栽培坟场树木，按期按坟头添土。
    另一方面，北京郊区农村因靠近都市，故有一些情况是一般农村所没有或者很少有的，如：
    １、农村生产商品化的程度比较大。全郊区有菜园二万四千二百亩，“三大季”土地（种二季庄稼一季菜蔬）十一万零六千二百亩。北京郊区农村的蔬菜一向除供给北京市外，还要向天津、保定、张家口输出。南郊的棉田四、五万亩，西郊和南郊的稻田二万三千亩，永定河西岸盛产的花生和白薯，西郊的水果、毛豆、荸荠等等，都是供给都市需要的商品生产。
    与这种商品生产相随而来的是：有些土地已开始采用简单的机器或其他的技术设备。如南郊有些村的电力水井，西郊的自流井，稻田区普遍采用的落稻机和剥米机，丰台、西直门外菜园设备的玻璃暖室等等。
    为生产商品而采用机器或其他科学技术设备都需要有巨额的资本投在土地上。这些土地经营的方式一般都是比较集中的，需要有较高的技术，因而经营方式也比较进步。
    ２、因城乡联系密切，所以有些大地主兼营商业或工业。全郊区地主共有四千九百零六户，其中兼营商业或工业者占百分之二十九以上。城内工商业资本家中，有四百零四户在郊区占有土地一万一千七百五十亩。此外，市内一部分劳动人民在郊区也有少量土地（多为坟地）且又出租的大约在五千五百户以上。
    ３、农村杂居有大批的非农业人口。全郊区六十四万人口中非农业人口约占百分之三十九·五。这些非农业人口除大部住在关厢和镇上外，混居在农村的也很多。上述远郊七个村子非农业人口占百分之十。上述近郊七个村子非农业人口占百分之三十八·一。这些非农业人口中最多的是卖青菜的及其他小商贩，各种小手工业工人，三轮车夫及贫民等。他们中很多人是没有固定职业的，生活经常处于半饥饿状态。
    ４、北京是人民的首都，随着城市工业及其他建设事业的发展，将有大批的农业土地变为市区土地。
    ５、人多地少。全郊区每人平均一亩八分地；近郊更少，每人平均仅一亩二分地；远郊约达三亩地。
    因此在北京郊区虽也必须和一般农村一样废除封建的土地制度，但在土地政策上，却不能不和一般农村有若干区别。
    二、关于郊区土地改革的若干具体政策问题
    北京郊区土地改革是根据一九四九年北京市军管会所颁布的“关于本市辖区农业土地问题的决定”执行的，这和一九五零年一月十三日政务院公布的“关于处理老解放区市郊农业土地问题的指示”的精神是一致的。在这里，我们仅就土地改革的若干具体政策问题分述如下：
    １、北京郊区在土地政策上和一般地区有一个原则的不同，即：没收地主土地和征收富农出租土地为国家所有，并由国家分配给无地少地的农民使用。
    为了城市工业及其他建设事业能自由合理地使用郊区土地，为了适应郊区人多地少的特点，为了照顾到用机器耕种和有进步设施的农田不应分配起见，将没收来的封建土地归国家所有，而由国家分配给农民使用或交由原经营者继续经营，经验证明是正确的。
    因为农民使用国有土地不交租子，纳农业税又和私有土地完全一样，种国家土地和种自己土地差不多；若土地收回修建工厂，只要能吸收其做工也是乐意的，因为他们看到工人的生活比自己还要好；同时这还可以解决地少人多分配土地的困难而满足了农民的土地要求，因为土地既是国家的，任何人不能买卖，这样，非农业人口就不会争着分地，而农民就可得到较多的土地使用了。因此，这样作法农民是能够接受的。并且由于农民对共产党及人民政府的信任，所以在国有土地上耕种并没有什么大的顾虑。如：西郊双槐树农民在所耕种的国有土地上施肥普遍比土地在地主手中时多四成以上，把旱地改为水地或园地的有六百六十五亩。南郊槐房村农民在所耕种的国有土地上打新井三眼，修旧井一眼。榆树庄农民侯更匙在所耕种的国有土地上费工十五个，铲平了一个高坡，扩大耕地半亩。十八里店农民郭原在所耕种的国有土地上植树四十株，并盖了几间土房。
    ２、北京郊区土地改革对待富农的政策是：只征收了富农的出租土地，富农自耕及雇工耕种的土地及其他财产一概未动。
    北京郊区富农的人口为一万六千七百零一人，土改前占有土地八万八千七百亩，其中出租土地有二万二千零五十亩，自耕土地六万余亩。
    不动富农这六万余亩自耕和雇工耕种的土地及其他财产是有许多好处的：
    甲、有利于早日恢复农村生产。首先是有利于稳定和刺激中农的生产情绪。双槐树村今年新买水车八辆，其中有七辆就是中农买的。正如中农石文元说：“富农都不动，我们还顾虑什么？”稳定和刺激了中农的生产情绪，在实际上就等于鼓励了贫农和雇农的生产情绪。因为一般贫农和雇农在土地改革后必然会迅速地上升为中农。今天的贫农和雇农也就是明天的中农。同时，富农的生产工具、资金及其他生产条件都较一般农民优良。保存富农经济是有利于经济之恢复和发展及城市菜蔬之供给的。
    乙、有利于孤立地主。土改前，富农和地主惶恐的心情是相同的。一般富农认为自己一定是土改的对象；一般农民也是这样的看法，但当土改一划清阶级界线，富农一知道我们对他采取的政策和地主不一样，富农就开始远离地主，情绪趋向安定。
    丙、坚决地保护了中农。过去在土改划阶级中最感困难的是区别剥削分量是否超过百分之二十五的问题，即富农和中农的界线问题。因在农业生产上计算剥削分量是有着许多技术上的困难。因而很容易把中农错划成了富农。而这次采取了保存富农经济的政策，更保证了中农不受侵犯。
    （政务院注：这是在中华人民共和国土地改革法公布以前实行的，今后郊区实行土地改革，对富农出租土地问题自应照中华人民共和国土地改革法第六条执行。）
    ３、北京郊区土改只没收了地主的土地、耕畜、农具和多余的房屋、粮食，对于地主的底财及其他浮财一律未动。对于依靠土地为生的地主，也分给了与农民相同的一份土地使用。由于对地主阶级采用这些具体的政策，就使土改后绝大多数的地主开始参加了农业劳动，并将其底财和浮财开始转向农业生产或工商业的活动。在黑塔、双槐树两村所调查的七十九户地主，内除四户地主搬至城内居住外，只有三户未参加农业劳动，其他六十二户地主有八十二人开始参加了农业劳动。在商业活动方面，太平桥地主胡连清原有四头牲口，两辆大车，土改中将其与运输业无关而与封建土地相连的一头牲口，一辆大车没收了，他现在又买了一头骡子，一辆胶皮轮车。古城村地主郝清隆新近在城内一家煤铺内入了好几股。双槐树地主关洞天，土改后开始贩卖牲口。这是一些很好的现象。一个过去完全是寄生的阶级，现在开始了新的生活。
    ４、土改中对工商业采取了保护的政策，因此对城市、街镇及乡村的大小工商业没有引起任何波动。相反地，在没收与征收土地后，他们感到更安心了，而一心一意地更好地来经营自己的工商业了。
     三、土地改革的一般过程
    郊区土地改革大体上分以下三个步骤：酝酿准备，没收土地和分配斗争果实。这些步骤是不能机械分开的。而每一步骤的具体工作和方法也不是完全一样的。
    １、土改工作组到村，首先是公开的向一切的人（包括地主在内）说明来意。公开的告诉地主人民政府对他们的政策是什么，并警告地主要遵守人民政府的政策法令。这样作，既能迅速动员农民进行土地改革，又能迅速安定一般人及地主的恐惧心情。
    在这一步骤中，最重要的是了解各阶层的动态，发现积极分子，根据村中多数农民当前最迫切的要求进行第一个具体的斗争。有六十六个村子是从反恶霸斗争开始的，其他有从退“上打租”开始的，也有从组织生产救灾开始的。事实证明：凡是根据村中多数农民当前最迫切的要求进行土地改革工作的村子，农民群众发动的都比较充分，以后工作也能比较顺利的进行。
    反恶霸斗争的方法，以群众当场控诉与法庭受理相结合为最好，既能提高群众反恶霸的勇气和信心，密切人民政府和人民的关系；又能使斗争有组织、有秩序地进行，不致发生乱打乱杀的现象。郊区土改中一共斗争了一百三十名恶霸，其中有四十名大恶霸交法院处理，其他小恶霸在其向群众低头后，即不予追究。在四十名大恶霸中，判处死刑者七名，无期徒刑者一名，有期徒刑者二十六名，尚未处理者六名。这样以来，一般地主都不敢明目张胆地轻视农民、抵抗土改了。
    在取得了反恶霸或其他的斗争胜利之后，即成立村农民代表会议。工作组的干部与村农民代表会结合是完成土地改革最好的组织形式。第一批多数村子和第二、三批村子我们是广泛的运用了村农民代表会的方式。村农民代表会一般都作到贫雇农占三分之二，中农占三分之一；并按地区把农民分编为若干组，为了工作组指导工作方便，往往把几个组并在一起开会，农民叫这为“片儿会”；建立在这样基础上的村农民代表会，代表性是最广泛的，工作组的意见就能很快的传到群众中去，群众的意见也能迅速的反映上来。
    ２、第二步骤包括划分阶级和没收地主的土地及其应没收的房屋、农具、牲口、粮食等两个工作。划分阶级是这一步骤中极为重要与极应慎重的问题。这是分清敌我，以便战斗的前提。因此：
    （１）必须讲明划分阶级的标准，务使家喻户晓，连地主在内都应该了解阶级的划分。讲阶级时，多举实例，讲明人民政府对待每一个阶级的具体政策是什么，这样，最容易为农民所接受。只要农民群众懂得了划分阶级的标准和对待每一个阶级的具体政策，在土地改革中就不易犯错误了。
    （２）充分发扬民主，划谁谁到场，自报成份，由群众评定；本人如不同意，可以当场辩论并可向政府提出控诉。这样作，好处是：当场摆清情况，找出根据，使被划者口服心服，并且从和地主反复辩论中，可以提高群众的阶级觉悟。这是郊区土地改革中所普遍采用的成功的方法。有少数村子划阶级没有掌握住这一精神，发生了偏差，竟把几户中农逼得承认是地主或富农了。
    （３）要正确地区别主要劳动与附带劳动。郊区划阶级中争执最多的是主要劳动与附带劳动的区别。在这个问题上，最难区别的是园艺的主要劳动与附带劳动。因为园艺需要多种劳动，有不少园主除雇用技术工人外，自己和家人则参加看水、拔草、割菜或到市上推销产品等劳动，这些劳动是园艺生产上不可缺少的一部分，而且是常年操作的，因而，应把这些劳动算作主要劳动。有些村子，由于没有掌握住这一精神，就把不少富农错划成了地主。
    （４）不能单纯以一般农村划分阶级的观点来划分大城市郊区农村的阶级。因郊区农村夹杂着大量兼有一部分土地的非农业人口，此外，还有居住城区而在郊区占有土地的人。如不从实际情况出发，就会发生把兼有少量土地的非农业劳动者及资本家划成地主或富农的错误。把朋友变成敌人，增加土地改革的困难。在第一批土地改革中，很多村子都犯了这一错误。我们根据中共华北局一九四八年十二月关于阳泉市土改划阶级的指示，普遍地检查了划分阶级的工作，才迅速纠正过来。
    （５）为正确划分城区居民在郊区占有土地者的成份，我们采用了：教育和依靠佃户提供材料（但应警惕有些佃户故意提高非地主的出租土地者的成份），由土地所在村通知本人前来自报并参加民主评定成份的会议；或查明出租土地者在城区的住址，由该管区公所及公安派出所协助调查等方法。
    （６）富裕中农极讨厌自己头上有个“富”字。划阶级时，可以不再在中农中区分出富裕中农来，凡是这样作了的村子，富裕中农的生产情绪就更加安定。
    在划阶级后，即开始没收地主的土地、农具、耕畜及多余的粮食和房屋的工作。没收地主的土地就是要地主交出红契来。没收地主农具、耕畜及多余的粮食和房屋的工作中普遍采用了有组织、有秩序的接收办法。即由农会命令地主对于应该没收的东西妥为保管，造具清册，如有破坏盗运者，定予惩处。之后，由农会或代表会根据清册加以调查审核，除应予留下者外，由群众选出代表组织登记、搬运、保管三个组到地主家中接收。这样作，好处是：可以减少地主破坏现象，三组互相监督可以避免某些分子私自偷拿，并不致发生动一般浮财的混乱现象。
    ３、第三步骤是分配斗争果实。一般的是先分配土地。因为郊区人多地少，凡过去主要不依靠农业劳动为生的人，可以不分配土地或少分配土地。分配土地的主要对象是无地与少地的农民，再次，才是愿意种地的失业工人及其他贫苦的人民。一般的是把土地按产量分为若干等级，照顾土地的远近，参照要地者的原有土地数量，以人口为单位分配的，对于单身汉或只有二口人的农户一般是按两口人或三口人计算分配的。西郊各村把应该分配的土地划成图样，解决了分配土地中许多复杂的技术问题，这是一种科学的工作方法。对于农具、耕畜、粮食和房屋的分配主要根据照顾农民的生产需要和统算统分，公平搭配两个原则。
    无论分配土地或分配农具、耕畜、粮食和房屋，一般都采用了自报公议的方法。自报的结果，往往是超过了实有斗争果实的数量，这时，即选择要求分地或分其他果实最低的户数作基础，采取户与户比的方法，逐户减舍，如此反复几遍，绝大多数人都感到公平合理了，然后经农民大会通过，出榜公布作为定案。这就使斗争果实分配比较公平，迅速，避免了因人多地少，人人感到土地使用不足或为少量土地拖住的现象。最后是颁发土地使用证。郊区多数村子土地改革一结束，农民就领到了土地使用证，对于安定农民的生产情绪有很大的作用。许多农民高兴地说：“私凭文书官凭印，有了土地使用证种地就靠实了。”
    土地改革是一个发动农民群众起来与地主阶级进行斗争的过程。只有发动起农民群众，才能顺利地解决这一伟大的历史任务。发动群众，首先必须使群众真正懂得人民政府的土地政策，才能使土地改革成为群众自己的行动。因此，我们必须以各种方法，进行广泛深入的宣传教育工作，并须把这一工作贯穿到土地改革运动全部过程的每一个环节与每一个具体工作中去，才能逐步地提高农民的觉悟及政策水平，而使土地改革成为有领导、有秩序地一种革命行动。若不发动群众只单纯依靠工作组的干部去进行，必然使农民优势树立不起来，地主的气焰打垮不了，封建消灭不彻底，果实分配不公平，而且会造成今后工作中许多困难。因此，有领导的发动农民群众自己起来解放自己，是土地改革工作中最重要的一条经验。
     四、土地改革的领导问题
    郊区之所以能够“有步骤有秩序地进行土地改革工作”，在领导上有以下几点经验：
    （１）必须于土地改革前在干部中充分进行政策教育。使干部真正了解了政策即打通思想，而不是仅仅在组织上服从。这次我们将郊区土地政策普遍地在干部中酝酿了几个月，并采用了学习文件与土地改革实验村相结合的方法，去年曾在七个村进行了土地改革实验工作，又着重检查了当时干部思想作风上的两个主要偏向——无组织无纪律和命令主义。这是郊区土改执行政策中没有发生大偏差的主要原因之一。
    （２）正确组织干部力量，分批进行土地改革工作。参加土地改革工作的四百六十九个干部中，在老区作过土地改革的一百三十五人。因为这些干部缺乏大城市近郊的土地改革经验和为了稳步的进行土地改革，非采取集中使用干部，分批进行工作不可。这种集中使用干部的组织形式，即是土改工作组。每一个土改工作组由五至九人组成。每个工作组每批只许进行一个行政村的土改工作。郊区的土改工作是分三批完成的：第一批七十三个村，一般费时两个月，第二批一百零二个村，第三批八十八个村，一般费时一个半月。这样分批进行土改最大的好处是便于领导上掌握，不致发生一下撒开无法领导、掌握的现象。
    （３）充分利用近代交通工具，坚决执行请示报告制度。每个工作组两天或三天向区汇报工作一次。各区每隔三天向市电话汇报一次，每一周书面综合报告一次，有重大事情，则随时报告请示。郊区工作委员会并配备有巡视员，经常到各村了解情况，检查工作，基本上做到了领导上能及时了解下情，好的经验能及时推广，出了偏向也能及时得到改正。
    （４）必须坚决防止土地改革中农民的自发斗争。在土地改革开始的浪潮下，刘各庄、马房寺、福田寺三个村子农民自发的进行了土地改革。三个村子自发斗争的对象，只有四户是地主（内一户恶霸地主），其他为四户富农，十八户中农。又多是首先以查封或没收粮食为目的，马房寺还捆打了一户地主。在发生这些事件后，我们立即指示各区召集未开始土改村的农会干部开会，明确规定：在土改工作组未到前，只许宣传政策及进行准备工作，而不许正式动手。同时，对于已发生自发行动的村子则派专人去处理善后工作。这就保证了土地改革能按照我们的计划按照土地改革政策分批进行，并稳定了一些对土地改革怀有恐惧心理的人们的情绪。
    最后，在领导思想上必须明确：领导的正确与否，不仅要看政策是否正确而且要看对既已确定的政策贯彻如何。因此在领导上要掌握凡是遇到违犯政策的现象就必须纠正。同时，在纠偏时一定要及时，要坚决，只要认为是真正错误了，是和政策相违背的，那就要及时地坚决纠正。纠偏不等于不放手，泼冷水。经验证明，在及时地纠正了偏向后，工作是更发展得顺利了。有的认为偏向尚非主要危险时，可以不去管他，这是不对的。
     五、土地改革的成绩及土改后农村的新变化
    经过五个半月紧张热烈的土改工作，郊区农村在根本上发生了新的变化。
    全郊区在土地改革中共没收封建土地四十万零二千九百亩，大小农具六万九千零八十三件，耕畜一千七百四十三头，粮食一百三十三万二千斤，房屋二万二千二百七十八间。得到土地的农民共计二十二万九千八百九十二人。这就是说：几千年来的封建土地制度在人民首都的郊区是彻底的被消灭了。
    在土地改革中农民的政治觉悟显著提高了一步。全郊区组织在农会的农民计十一万六千五百人（郊区农业人口共三十五万人）。由于农民在经济上和政治上翻了身，旧社会染给农民的某些不良习惯和落后迷信思想也开始在发生变化。如西郊稻田区有许多单身汉的雇农从前喝酒、赌钱、嫖妓女，土地改革中分到土地了，他们自动的戒除了一切不良嗜好，他们精打细算在一、二年内要为自己成家立业，南郊南庄子农民郭老太太在得到土地以后，高兴的说：“从前我们供着关公老爷，说他有灵应，灵应在那里？依我看来，我们供谁呢？就是供我们的毛主席！”他们生产情绪很高，都在积极的为完成增产任务而奋斗。
