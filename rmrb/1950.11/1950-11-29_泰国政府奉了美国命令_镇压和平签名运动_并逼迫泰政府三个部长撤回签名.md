Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 26th (TASS): British and American newspapers, seeing the success of the signature campaign for the Stockholm Appeal in Bangkok, are attacking it fiercely. The Thai government, intimidated by the clamor of the British and American newspapers, issued an ignorant and absurd statement opposing the Stockholm Appeal.

The statement issued by the Thai Ministry of Propaganda said that the "Peace Declaration" was not supported by the government. It also said that the Peace Declaration was proposed by the "World Peace Congress convened in Stockholm by the communist World Federation of Trade Unions."

The Thai fascist party, the "Thai Free League," hurriedly distributed propaganda pamphlets throughout the country, telling people not to sign the Stockholm Appeal, and even threatened that anyone who signed the declaration, even indirectly, would be considered a supporter of communism. The police are watching the signature campaign.

The Thai government is suppressing peace advocates under the orders of US Ambassador Stanton. According to the reactionary *Bangkok Forum*, Stanton visited Luang Phibuns and told him that the Stockholm Appeal signature campaign was "communist propaganda."

Xinhua News Agency, November 28th: According to a United Press report from Bangkok on the 23rd, three Thai government ministers withdrew their signatures after signing the Peace Declaration at the request of Luang Phibuns. The three ministers are Deputy Minister of Agriculture Man Phong, Minister of Justice Nai Liang, and Minister of Transport Nai Ba Tong. The report revealed that Luang Phibuns' action was taken under the instructions of the United States. Prior to this, US Ambassador to Thailand Stanton had "visited" Luang Phibuns and "explained" the meaning of the peace signature to him.

　　泰国政府奉了美国命令
    镇压和平签名运动
    并逼迫泰政府三个部长撤回签名
    【新华社二十八日讯】塔斯社新德里二十六日电：英美报纸鉴于在斯德哥尔摩宣言上签名的运动在曼谷所获得的成功，正大肆加以攻击。泰国政府慑于英美报纸的叫嚣，发表了反对斯德哥尔摩宣言的无知而虚妄的声明。
    泰国宣传部所发出的声明中说：“和平宣言”是政府不支持的。又说：和平宣言是“共产党的世界工会联合会在斯德哥尔摩召集的世界和平大会”所提出的。
    泰国法西斯政党“泰国自由同盟”，慌忙在国内各地散发宣传小册子，叫人民不要在斯德哥尔摩宣言上签名，还恫吓地说：要是谁在宣言上签了名，纵使是间接的，都会被认为是共产主义的拥护者。警察正注视签名运动。
    泰国政府是奉美国大使史丹顿的命令镇压和平拥护者的。据反动的《曼谷论坛报》报道：史丹顿曾访问銮披汶，告诉他说：斯德哥尔摩宣言签名运动是“共产党的宣传”。
    【新华社二十八日讯】据合众社曼谷二十三日电，泰国政府三名部长签署了和平宣言后，在銮披汶的要求下，撤回了他们的签名。这三名部长是农业部副部长曼奉，司法部部长乃良和交通部部长乃巴统。该电透露，銮披汶这一行动，是奉美国的指示作出的。在此以前，美国驻泰大使史丹顿曾经“造访”銮披汶，向他“解释”和平签名的意义。
