　　The China National Democratic Construction Association Holds Symposium on Current Events
    Unite Industrial and Business Circles to Oppose American Imperialism
    China Association for Promoting Democracy Holds Symposiums at All Levels
    [Report from this newspaper] The China National Democratic Construction Association and the China Association for Promoting Democracy have held symposiums on current events for several consecutive days in order to oppose American imperialist aggression. On October 31st, the China National Democratic Construction Association held its 21st Standing Committee meeting, discussing the international situation and the current tasks of the association. It was unanimously agreed that it is necessary to actively strengthen the unity of national industrial and business circles to oppose American imperialist aggression against Taiwan and Korea. National industrial and business people must learn to strictly distinguish the boundaries between friends and enemies in the international arena, and understand the great significance of combining patriotism and internationalism. In order to defend world peace and seek the security of New China, we cannot ignore American imperialist aggression against Korea. Industrial and business people must increase production and work together for the liberation of Taiwan and support for Korea.
    The China Association for Promoting Democracy recently held symposiums on current events at all levels of its organization. The meeting unanimously agreed that the American troops invading Korea have approached our border and have continuously violated our airspace with aircraft, even resorting to indiscriminate strafing and killing our compatriots. This crazy and barbarous act directly threatens our national defense security. In the United Nations General Assembly, American imperialism is even attempting to usurp the name of the United Nations to interfere in our internal affairs and invade our Taiwan. This series of facts shows that the United States is following the old path of Japanese fascism. This is something we can never tolerate. Members of the association unanimously expressed their determination to step up their work and fight to defend the motherland and defend peace.

　　民主建国会举行时事座谈
    团结工商业者反对美帝
    民进会各级机构分别座谈
    【本报讯】民主建国会、中国民主促进会为反对美帝国主义侵略，连日均举行时事座谈会。民主建国会十月三十一日举行二十一次常务委员会，讨论了国际形势及该会当前的任务，一致认为应积极加强团结民族工商业者，反对美帝国主义侵略台湾朝鲜。全国工商业者必须学会严格分清国际上友敌的界限，认识爱国主义与国际主义结合的伟大意义。为了保卫世界和平，为了谋取新中国的安全，不能任听美帝国主义侵略朝鲜而置之不理。工商业者必须增加生产，为解放台湾和支援朝鲜而共同努力。
    中国民主促进会各级机构日前分别举行时事座谈。会上一致认为侵朝美军已逼近我国边境，并连续不断地用飞机侵犯我领空，以至横施扫射，杀害我同胞，这一疯狂横蛮的举动，直接威胁我国国防安全。在联合国大会上，美帝国主义更想盗用联合国名义来干涉我内政，侵占我台湾。这一系列的事实说明美国正在走着日本法西斯的老路。这是我们决不能容忍的。该会会员一致表示要加紧工作，为保卫祖国，保卫和平而斗争。
