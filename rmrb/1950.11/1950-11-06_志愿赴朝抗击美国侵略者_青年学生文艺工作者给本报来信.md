Volunteering to go to Korea to Resist American Aggressors
Letters to the Editor from Young Students and Artists

　　Not Letting the American Imperialists Threaten Our Studies
　　Our Entire Class Volunteers to Enlist
To the Editor:
　　The heinous American imperialists are barbarously invading our friendly neighbor Korea and slaughtering peaceful residents. They want to spread the flames of war to our motherland, and even the whole world. They have already occupied our territory of Taiwan, and have repeatedly and frantically strafed our compatriots, destroying our national construction. Such acts of aggression are absolutely intolerable to all peace-loving people and our patriotic youth.
　　Our classmates in the second year of the Simplified Normal School at the Hui Nationality College, upon seeing these inhuman and shameless atrocities, are filled with extreme hatred and burning anger. Every one of us is deeply concerned about world peace, and we are all peace-loving and resolutely support peace. But now that the American imperialists have invaded our land, we all feel that we really cannot sit idly by and can no longer endure it.
　　For the future construction of the motherland, for the happiness and freedom of the people, for the studies of us young people, and for the construction of a prosperous and happy motherland, our entire class has sworn to volunteer to join the army, to participate in the war, to defend lasting world peace, to defend the motherland, and to overthrow American imperialism!
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　The Entire Student Body of the Second Year of the Simplified Normal School, Hui Nationality College

　　We Volunteer to Rush to Korea
　　Actively Support Our Korean Brothers
To the Editor:
　　The Chinese people, under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, have gained freedom and happiness, and construction is actively underway in various regions. But the American imperialists have again brazenly launched a war of aggression. Korea is our close friendly neighbor, and the American imperialists are our common enemy. We, the Chinese people, will never allow the American imperialists to be so rampant. Flames of anger are burning in everyone's heart. We must turn anger into strength!
　　We unanimously express our willingness to rush to Korea and actively support our Korean brothers with practical actions. Before we leave our work posts, we will definitely complete our work tasks more resolutely and more perfectly, unite more closely under the banner of Chairman Mao, and strive to completely eliminate the American aggressors.

　　Willing to Fight Side-by-Side with the Korean People
　　To Fight the American Aggressors to the End
To the Editor:
　　Our blood has long been boiling! The American imperialists' attack on neighboring Korea and their ambition to invade our motherland have made our eyes burn with anger. In order to defend peace, we have repeatedly issued stern warnings to the American imperialists. But facts have proven that if we concede an inch, the aggressors will advance a foot. Standing on the position of defending our motherland, we declare: Every inch of the new China's land was won by our revolutionary martyrs with their heads and blood. The fruits of victory are our own, and our freedom and independence must not be trampled upon by imperialism. We cannot sit idly by and ignore the American imperialists' aggression against Korea, and we cannot allow them to directly threaten our security.
　　When we were fighting the Japanese devils, we were still ignorant little children. Now we are strong and energetic iron men. Resisting aggressors is the revolutionary tradition and task of the Chinese people, especially the Chinese youth. Resisting America and aiding Korea is the glorious right and duty of Chinese youth. We unanimously are willing to fight side by side with our Korean brothers and fight the aggressors to the end!

　　I Want to Go to the Most Fierce Part of the Korean War
　　Resolutely Refuse to Yield and Fight for Human Peace and Happiness
To the Editor:
　　The American imperialists have launched an inhuman war of aggression in Korea, and have invaded our northeastern airspace, killing our compatriots and occupying our Taiwan, preventing our People's Liberation Army from liberating the compatriots in Taiwan. Our professors and students have also been detained. At the same time, they are directing their lackeys, wielding American-made weapons of murder, to carry out bloody massacres in Asia and other places. The people of the world can see very clearly that this is entirely the American imperialists' attempt to undermine peace in the Far East and undermine peace throughout the world. Furthermore, during the War of Resistance Against Japan and the Liberation War, many Korean youths shed their blood and sacrificed everything for the liberation of our Chinese people, for the happiness of our Chinese people. Today, the Chinese people have been liberated, but the Korean people are still suffering from imperialist bombing and slaughter. Of course, we cannot sit idly by.
　　My intention is: I want to go to Korea, to the most fierce part of the Korean War. In order to protect our homeland, in order to protect all the people of Asia, in order to protect peace in Asia, I am determined to wage a firm and unyielding struggle for the happiness of the people of the world.

　　志愿赴朝抗击美国侵略者
    青年学生文艺工作者给本报来信
    不让美帝威胁我们的学习
    我们全班同学都志愿参军编辑同志：
    万恶的美帝国主义者，蛮横侵略我友邦朝鲜，屠杀和平居民。它想把战争的火焰延烧到我们的祖国，甚至全世界。它已占据了我国领土台湾，并多次疯狂地扫射我国同胞，破坏我们祖国建设。这种侵略暴行，凡爱好和平的人民及我们爱国青年，是决不能忍受的。
    我们回民学院简师二年级同学，看到了这种不讲人道的无耻暴行，个个痛恨已极，怒火中烧。我们每个同学，都是十分关怀着世界和平，也都是爱好和平坚决拥护和平的。但是现在美帝国主义者已侵略到我们的头上，我们全班同学，觉得实在不可坐视，已是忍无可忍了。
    为了祖国今后的建设，为了人民幸福自由，为了我们青年人的学习，为了建设富强康乐的祖国，我们全班同学都宣誓志愿参军、参战，保卫世界持久和平，保卫祖国、打倒美帝国主义！
            回民学院简师二年级全体学生
    我们志愿奔赴朝鲜
    积极支援朝鲜弟兄编辑同志：
    中国人民在毛主席英明领导下，得到了自由和幸福，目前各地都在积极进行建设。但是美帝却又蛮横地发动了侵略战争。朝鲜是我们亲密的友邦，美帝是我们共同的敌人。我们中国人民决不允许美帝这样猖狂，在每个人的心里都燃烧起了愤怒的火焰。我们要把愤怒化为力量！
    我们一致表示：志愿奔赴朝鲜，以实际行动积极援助朝鲜的弟兄。在我们未离开工作岗位以前，我们一定更坚决地、更完满地完成工作任务，更紧密地团结在毛主席的旗帜下，为彻底消灭美国侵略者而奋斗。

    愿与朝鲜人民并肩作战
    和美国侵略者决斗到底编辑同志：
    我们的热血早已沸腾了！美帝国主义对邻邦朝鲜的进攻及侵略我们祖国的野心，使我们气得眼睛都冒火了。为了保卫和平，我们曾经向美帝一而再地提出了严正警告。但事实证明，我们再让一寸，侵略者会再进一尺。我们站在保卫祖国的立场上表示：新中国的每一寸土地都是先烈们用头颅热血争来的，胜利的果实是我们自己的，我们的自由独立决不能允许帝国主义来糟蹋。我们不能坐视美帝侵朝而置之不理，不能让它直接威胁我们的安全。
    打日寇时，我们还是一些不懂事的小娃娃；现在我们已经是年青力壮的铁汉了。抵抗侵略者是我们中国人民特别是中国青年的革命传统与任务；抗美援朝是我们中国青年光荣的权利和义务，我们一致愿意和朝鲜兄弟们并肩作战，和侵略者决斗到底！

    我要到朝鲜战争最激烈的地方去
    坚决不屈为人类和平幸福而斗争编辑同志：
    美国帝国主义者在朝鲜发动了惨无人道的侵略战争，并侵犯我国东北领空，杀害我国同胞，侵占着我们台湾，阻挡我们人民解放军解放台湾的同胞；我国教授和学生也被扣留。同时它还指使它的狗腿子们，拿着美国制的杀人武器，在亚洲等地实行血腥屠杀。全世界人民看得很清楚，这完全是美帝国主义要破坏远东的和平，破坏全世界的和平。再说，我们在抗日战争和解放战争中，有不少朝鲜的青年，他们流尽了鲜血，为解放我们中国的人民，为我们中国人民的幸福，牺牲了他们的一切。今天我们中国人民已得到了解放，但是朝鲜人民还在受着帝国主义的轰炸、屠杀，我们当然不能坐视不理。
    我的意思：我要到朝鲜去，到朝鲜战争最激烈的地方去。为了保卫家乡，为了保卫我们全亚洲人民，为了保卫亚洲的和平，我坚决要为全世界人民的幸福作坚强不屈的斗争。
