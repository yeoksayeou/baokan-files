　　Brutal American Aggressors
　　Méiyǔ
　　On August 10, 1945, Japan announced its unconditional surrender. On September 16, the first batch of American troops landed in Qingdao. Until their forced withdrawal in early 1949, for more than two years, with imperialist aims, the American troops not only actively helped the Kuomintang reactionaries' traitorous government directly wage a civil war in an attempt to maintain its dictatorial rule, but also, under the beautiful lie of "the United States government assisting China in achieving peace and unity, with the Marine Corps merely a tool for this policy," staged countless atrocities on the land defended by the Chinese people with their lives and blood. Wherever American troops set foot, whether in Shanghai, Nanjing, Qingdao, Beijing, Tianjin, Hankou, or Chongqing, they acted recklessly, wantonly killing Chinese people, looting property, raping women, and engaging in armed smuggling, behaving as victors who regarded China as a conquered nation. These atrocities aroused immense anger and hatred in every Chinese person with national self-respect. Now, as the American imperialist aggressor troops, after ravaging the Korean people, are arrogantly attempting to once again intrude into our sacred and solemn homeland to commit further atrocities, it is entirely necessary for us to painfully recall the various atrocities committed by the American troops stationed in China. Here, based on extremely incomplete materials sparsely recorded in a few private newspapers and periodicals at the time, we have compiled the more significant events. From these events, we can see the faces of the invaders and how these beasts insulted our national dignity and slaughtered the Chinese people.

　　　　I. Accidents and Injuries
　　Here, we will only cite a few examples of incidents in which American military jeeps killed and injured Chinese people in Shanghai alone, from December 1945 to August of the following year:
　　On December 8, 1945, an American military two-and-a-half-ton truck sped wildly along Avenue Albert, hitting a Chinese car, killing three people and seriously injuring one. After the accident, the truck sped away, crashing into a tricycle, killing the driver and seriously injuring the passenger. The truck still did not stop and sped towards the Rue de Guiraud intersection, hitting two pedestrians and destroying several rickshaws, running over and killing one person, and knocking down several trees and telegraph poles. The truck caused a total of four accidents, running over and killing five people and seriously injuring three. On January 16, 1946, the Shanghai Wenhui Daily reported that in just half a month, from January 1 to January 16, there were 123 incidents of American military vehicles causing accidents, injuring 105 Chinese people. On March 16, Xia Yan, a famous Chinese playwright, and Ge Baoquan, a translator, were injured by an American military jeep. On April 7, a fifteen-year-old girl, Kui Jufang, was knocked down by an American military jeep in Shanghai, her brains splattered and her chest and legs bleeding profusely; on the same day, a fifty-nine-year-old woman was knocked down from behind by a jeep, her head split open in a gruesome sight. On May 11, Lieutenant Commander Cristenson of the U.S. Navy drove a giant jeep at high speed on Nanjing Road in Shanghai, suddenly demolishing the tram platform at the Shanxi Road intersection. The giant cement pillar on the platform was knocked down, and five men and women waiting for the tram were injured. The American officer abandoned the vehicle and fled after the accident. Xu Asheng, who was the most seriously injured, suffered fractures in his left back and left foot and died on the morning of the 12th. The other four people were seriously injured. On August 16, at Hongqiao Jiao, Hongkou Li, Shanghai, an American military jeep sped across the bridge and quickly turned towards Rue Pellot, the front of the vehicle crashing into the Hesheng Teahouse. A six-year-old child standing on the sidewalk was run over and killed. The vehicle then attempted to flee, but a young man on the side of the road, unable to contain his anger, jumped onto the vehicle and ordered it to stop. Unexpectedly, the American soldier not only did not stop but also struck the young man off the vehicle with a club. On August 20, Zhang Yongchun, the principal of Shanghai Municipal Elementary School, accompanied by his two sons, Zhang Pingxun (seventeen years old), was walking past the entrance of No. 51 Rue Pichon when a U.S. military hospital ambulance with license plate number Hu Guo 4119 rushed onto the sidewalk, killing Zhang Pingxun on the spot. Zhang Yongchun was thrown more than ten feet away and was seriously injured, dying the next day.

　　The above incidents are just a few examples of the thousands of incidents that occurred during the more than two years of American military presence in China. From a statistical material published by the Kuomintang reactionary Shanghai "official" at the time, it can be seen that in the 126 days from September 12, 1945, to January 10 of the following year, there were as many as 495 incidents of American military jeeps causing injuries and deaths, averaging four tragic incidents per day. The number of people injured and killed was 236, averaging two deaths and injuries per day. In reality, the number was certainly higher than this. According to incomplete statistics from six newspapers at the time, there were 115 serious injuries and 34 deaths in 78 jeep accidents from December 1945 to July 28, 1946. According to Wenhui Daily, in August 1946 alone, 35 people were admitted to Shanghai Guangci Hospital due to injuries caused by American military jeeps, including two serious injuries and five deaths. If we use the "official" statistic of an average of two deaths and injuries per day, then during the American military presence in China, in Shanghai alone, approximately 3,000 people died unjustly under the wheels of American military jeeps.

　　Not only did American military jeeps run rampant on land, but in Shanghai, American ships anchored in the Huangpu River also repeatedly damaged civilian boats and injured workers. For example, on February 16, 1946, a barge was sunk by an American landing craft, killing one person and injuring two; on May 22, a sailboat was sunk by an American transport ship, killing sailor Weng Apin. On September 6, the giant ship St. Nsblen of the American company Wei Li Hao collided with three wooden boats carrying canned food belonging to the Fuxing Tug and Barge Transportation Company outside the Wusongkou. In addition to all the cargo sinking to the bottom of the sea, 14 crew members were also overturned into the sea. Only four people were rescued and survived. According to the United Evening News in 1946, in eleven months, more than a hundred waterway workers in Shanghai became victims of American ships.

　　In addition, the car accidents caused by American troops in other cities were even more numerous. For example, according to incomplete materials from past newspapers, in August 1946, there were eight serious traffic accidents caused by American military vehicles in Beijing, killing seven people and injuring one. In the three weeks from September 12 to October 3, there were six serious accidents caused by American military jeeps in Tianjin, sometimes as many as four in a single day. In Nanjing, the number of accidents was equally frequent. For example, on October 22, 1947, Granny Tang Huirong was sitting in a rickshaw when she was hit and killed by a jeep with license plate number Shi Zi 03414 from the American Embassy at the Beting Lane intersection. When the victim's family went to the American Embassy and the American Military Advisory Group to negotiate, the response they received was: "The American military is completely innocent."

　　　　II. Beatings and Shootings
　　Arbitrarily beating and killing our people in the guise of victors is one of the "civilizations" of America. Countless of our people have sacrificed their lives in vain in this way. The brutal atrocities of the American aggressors are forever etched in the hearts of our people. Here, we will still take Shanghai as an example: In the short two months of October and November 1945, according to scattered statistics, American troops had already beaten and shot seven or eight people for no reason. For example, on October 8, in the city center near Ronglu Hengchan Company, American troops claimed that a Chinese worker had stolen a bag of sugar from the company and shot the worker to death. From January to October 1946, the bloody incidents caused by American troops in Shanghai occurred almost every day, with no fewer than thirty major incidents. For example, on January 22, 20,000 unemployed workers in Shanghai marched and petitioned. When they passed the Bund on Beijing Road, a group of American soldiers threw beer bottles at the workers from a high-rise building, injuring five workers, including two seriously injured. On August 23, three drunken American sailors in Shanghai hired a rickshaw and ordered the driver to run fast. When the driver was exhausted, the three sailors suddenly jumped off the rickshaw and "attacked" the driver, beating him severely. On September 5, an American soldier broke into a store on South Shaanxi Road, stubbornly insisting that the store had stolen his things, and unreasonably beat the store's employees and smashed the store's equipment. On September 22, American troops shot dead rickshaw driver Zang Dayaozi in front of the Huadu Ballroom on Xikou Road in Shanghai for no reason. After the incident, the American soldier who committed the murder arrogantly left in an American military patrol vehicle in full view of the public.

　　In Tianjin, on September 6, 1946, farmer He Wanshun was shot and killed by American troops while harvesting crops near the American military camp. On September 23, American troops threw an eleven-year-old girl, Hu Xiaomei, into the river and drowned her. When a group of people went into the water to rescue her, the American soldiers stood on the shore and watched with amusement. Four days later, two American soldiers pushed a female beggar into the river and drowned her near the Qiangzi River. In Beijing, on September 19, a Chinese farmer, Ren Yizhuang, was shot and killed by American guards while passing near the Xiyuan Airfield. On the evening of September 26, an American soldier broke into the dormitory of female staff members of the CCP's resident delegation in Beijing Hotel, No. 229, and fled in a panic only after being sternly reprimanded.

　　The Zhonghe Bridge incident in which American troops drowned residents cooling off in the river, which was deeply hated and never forgotten by the people of Nanjing, and the Xinsheng Elementary School incident in which more than a dozen elementary school teachers and students were beaten and injured, are just two examples of the countless incidents of American troops beating, insulting, and injuring the Chinese people.

　　　　III. Robbery and Harassment
　　When the American aggressor troops were frantically attacking Seoul, the butcher MacArthur "encouraged" his soldiers in this way: After you take Seoul, "all the women in Seoul are yours; you can send packages back to America!" This shameless and bestial behavior and banditry of the American aggressor troops are completely familiar to the Chinese people. Here are a few examples from countless incidents:

　　On January 12, 1946, Shanghai newspapers reported: An American sailor entered a shoe store, robbed a pair of leather shoes, and knocked the shop owner to the ground when he chased after him. At the same time, more than ten American soldiers in Shanghai ganged up near the Daxin Company on the most bustling Nanjing Road, robbing pedestrians of their coats, watches, and other items. On August 24, Shanghai newspapers reported: An American military officer embezzled 150,000 U.S. dollars worth of gold bars in Taiwan. The military officer is now in the United States and is still at large.

　　The Shanghai Wenhui Daily on September 4, 1946, and the Tianjin Dagong Daily on September 14 both published complaint letters from readers Bu Qiuxue and Yu Buping, indignantly recounting their experiences of being armed searched and robbed by a group of American soldiers.

　　According to "official" statistics alone, the incidents of American troops stationed in China robbing Chinese people of their property occurred an average of almost one a day, with a total of 90 incidents in the one hundred days from October 1945 to January 1946.

　　　　IV. Insult and Rape
　　The incidents of American troops insulting and raping Chinese women are too numerous to count. These beasts left shameful traces in every corner of China they set foot in, treating the Chinese people with the same atrocities they used to oppress and bully "black slaves." The largest rape incidents were the Shen Chong incident in Beijing in December 1946 and the collective rape incident at Jingming Building in Hankou on August 8, 1948. In particular, the Shen Chong incident sparked a nationwide anti-atrocity movement at the time. Why did the Shen Chong incident arouse such widespread anger? This was precisely because the American troops' rape atrocities had already been rampant everywhere before this, and had made the patriotic people of the whole country unable to bear it any longer, and finally erupted with pent-up hatred. At that time, it was very common in the city streets for American troops to openly snatch women and drag them onto jeeps, and to openly break into people's homes to insult women. For example, on March 15, 1946, a woman surnamed Deng on Xinchang Road in Shanghai was followed and broken into her home by four American soldiers who forcibly raped her. On June 28, four American soldiers in Chongqing openly broke into the women's bathroom of the Huixian Building Hotel, insulted the women who were bathing in every possible way, and then gathered more than 20 American soldiers to destroy the hotel. On September 3, a woman in Nanjing said in a letter to a newspaper: "When my hometown fell, I was insulted by six Japanese devils. I escaped with great difficulty. Unfortunately, now I have been subjected to indecency by the high-nosed 'allies'..."

　　× × ×

　　The above examples are just a few of the thousands of atrocities committed by American troops, but from these examples alone, it can be seen that the American aggressors' attitude towards the Chinese people is exactly the same as that of the Japanese aggressors. They both treat the Chinese land as their own garden and the Chinese people as their own slaves. At the same time, today's American aggressors have not only completely replaced the position of yesterday's Japanese aggressors, but are even more brutal, more greedy, and more shameless than the Japanese aggressors, being "worse than them." Because the Japanese aggressors' aggression was blatant and reckless; while all the aggressive acts of the American aggressors are cloaked in beautiful garb. Yesterday's Japanese aggressors and today's American aggressors have the same purpose in enslaving China, and what is even worse is that yesterday's Japanese were painted-face bandits, and their hideous faces were easy to see; while today's American aggressors are wearing masks, putting on disguises, and waving the sky-blue flag of the "United Nations." However, the vast majority of Chinese people will not be deceived and deceived forever, because they were direct victims, such as the families of Shen Chong and Zang Dayaozi, as well as the families of those drowned at Zhonghe Bridge in Nanjing, the teachers and students of Xinsheng Elementary School who were beaten and injured, and other victims and eyewitnesses of countless atrocities by American troops... No matter what brand the brutal aggressors are waving, what clothes they are wearing, or what lies they are telling, people will always be able to clearly see their "true face." Today, when the American aggressors are trying to break into our motherland again and carry out another atrocity, under the flames of the vast people's unanimous demand for revenge, the aggressors will eventually be burned to ashes!

　　残暴的美国侵略者
　　梅雨
    一九四五年八月十日，日本宣布无条件投降，九月十六日，第一批美军在青岛登陆，直到一九四九年初被迫撤退时，两年多中，怀着帝国主义目的的美军除了积极帮助国民党反动派的卖国政府直接进行内战企图维持其独裁统治外，在“美国政府协助中国获得和平与统一，陆战队不过为此政策之工具而已”的美丽谎言所掩盖下，在中国人民用生命和鲜血保卫过的土地上，曾演出无数的暴行。凡是美军足迹到处，无论是上海、南京、青岛、北京、天津、汉口、重庆，都是横行无忌，肆意枪杀中国人民，劫掠财物，强奸妇女，武装走私，俨然以战胜者的姿态，把中国作为被征服者看待。这种暴行，曾使每一个有民族自尊心的中国人民，感到莫大的愤怒和仇视。现在，当美帝侵略军在蹂躏着朝鲜人民之余，又狂妄地企图再度闯入我神圣庄严的国土进行再一次的暴行的时候，让我们再惨痛地回忆一下美军驻华期间的种种暴行是完全必要的。这里，我们根据当时少数民间报刊上零星记载的极不完全的材料，把其中较重大的事件整理出来，从这些事件里，可以帮助我们看清侵略者的嘴脸，看清这些野兽们曾怎样地侮辱我们民族的尊严和屠杀中国人民。
            一、闯祸伤人事件
    这里仅就一九四五年十二月至次年八月在上海一地所发生的美军吉普车撞死撞伤中国人民的事件，举出几个例子：
    一九四五年十二月八日，上海美军用二吨半巨型卡车，沿亚尔培路狂驶，撞伤中国汽车一辆，死三人重伤一人。该车闯祸后加速逃走，又撞毁三轮车一辆，车夫被撞死，乘客重伤。而该车仍不停止，疾向巨籁达路口驶去，复又撞伤两行人，毁人力车数辆，并辗死一人，撞倒树木数棵，电线杆数根。该车共肇祸四处，前后辗死五人重伤三人。一九四六年一月十六日，上海文汇报载自一月一日至十六日仅半月中，美军车辆肇祸事件，即达一百二十三件，伤害中国人民一百零五人。三月十六日，我国著名剧作家夏衍及翻译家戈宝权被美军吉普撞伤。四月七日，十五岁的女孩篑菊芳被上海美军吉普撞倒，脑浆破裂，胸腿血流如注；同日，五十九岁老妇被吉普从背后撞倒，头被裂开，惨不忍睹。五月十一日，美海军中校克力司丁生，驾巨型吉普在上海南京路疾驰，突于山西路口将电车月台冲毁，月台上巨型水门汀柱被撞倒，当时有候乘电车的男女五人遭撞伤。该美军官于肇祸后，弃车逃走。受伤最重的徐阿生，左背左脚均折断，于十二日晨毙命，其余四人均受重伤。八月十六日，上海虹口里虹桥埆，美军吉普车疾驰过桥，飞快地向裴伦洛路转弯，车头已冲入鹤升茶楼，站在人行道上的一个六岁孩子被辗毙。该车即图逃走，路旁一青年气愤不过，当即跳上该车责令停驶。不料美军不但不停，反将那个青年一棒从车上打下来。八月二十日，上海市立小学校长张咏春，偕其二子张平荪（十七岁），行经毕勋路五一号门首，突有美军医院之沪国四一一九号军医车冲上人行道，将张平荪当场撞死，张咏春被撞出丈许外，受重伤，第二日不治身死。
    以上事件不过是美军驻华两年多中所发生的千万件事件中几个例子，从当时国民党反动派上海“官方”发表的一个统计材料中可以看到：自一九四五年九月十二日至次年一月十日的一百二十六天中，曾经发生美军吉普车撞伤撞死的事件有四百九十五起之多，平均每天就有四件惨案，被撞伤撞死者计二百三十六人，平均每天死伤两人。实际上当然是不止此数的。另据当时六个报纸所载吉普惨案的不完全统计：自一九四五年十二月起至一九四六年七月二十八日止的七十八件吉普惨案，即有一百十五人重伤，内三十四人死亡。又据文汇报载，仅上海广慈医院一处，在一九四六年八月份因被美军吉普车撞伤而入院者达三十五人，其中重伤二人，因伤致死者五人。如以“官方”统计每天平均死伤二人，则美军驻华期间，仅上海一地，即有三千人左右冤死于美军吉普车轮下。
    不仅陆地上美军吉普车到处逞凶，在上海，停泊在黄浦江的美舰也屡屡撞坏民船与工人。如一九四六年二月十六日驳船一只为美登陆艇撞沉，死一人，伤二人；五月二十二日帆船一只为美运输船撞沉，水手翁阿品撞死。九月六日，美商卫利号公司巨轮St nsblen号，在吴淞口外撞翻复兴拖驳运输公司小火轮载罐头食品的木船三只，除全部货物都沉入海底外，同时有船员十四人都被倾覆海中，事后仅四人得救生还。据一九四六年联合晚报统计，十一个月中，上海一地计有百余水上工人成了美舰的牺牲者。
    此外，美军在其他城市所闯的车祸，更是多不胜举。例如：根据过去报纸不完全的材料，在一九四六年八月份，美军汽车在北京肇事较严重者八起，撞死七人，伤一人。从九月十二日到十月三日的三周中，美军吉普在天津肇事较严重者六起，有时一日达四起以上。在南京，肇事的次数一样频仍，例如：一九四七年十月二十二日，唐慧融老婆婆坐在人力车上，在碑亭巷口被美大使馆使字○三四一四号吉普撞死，受害人家属到美大使馆及美军顾问团交涉时，得到的答复却是：“美军根本无罪。”
            二、毒打枪杀事件
    以胜利者的姿态任意殴辱和杀害我国人民，正是美国的“文明”之一，难以数计的我国人民曾经这样地白白牺牲了。美国侵略者的凶残暴行，是永远烙印在我国人民的心中。这里仍以上海一地为例：一九四五年十月、十一月短短的两个月中，根据零星的统计，美军即曾无故殴伤及枪杀七、八人。例如十月八日，在市中心区共荣路恒产公司附近，美军借口说一个中国工人偷了公司里一包糖，开枪打死了这个工人。一九四六年一月到十月，美军在上海所造成的血案，几乎无日无之，其中较大的事件也不下三十余件。例如：一月二十二日，上海两万失业工人游行请愿，经过北京路外滩时，一群美军竟在一大厦高层用啤酒瓶猛掷工人，击伤工人五名，内两人重伤。八月二十三日，上海美水兵三人，在酩酊大醉后，雇三轮车一辆，令车夫快跑，当车夫精疲力竭时，三水兵突从车上跳下，对车夫“突击”，将车夫赵培甫殴致重伤。九月五日，上海一美兵闯进陕西南路一家商店里，硬赖该店偷了他的东西，并蛮不讲理地毒打该店店员，捣毁店内器具。九月二十二日，美军在上海溪口路华都舞厅门首无故以拳击死人力车夫臧大咬子，出事后，在万目睽睽下，该杀人犯美军竟乘美军巡逻车扬长而去。
    在天津，一九四六年九月六日，农民何万顺在美兵营附近收割田禾竟被美军开枪射杀。九月二十三日，美军将一十一岁女孩胡小妹抱投河中淹毙，一行人下水拯救时，该美军还在岸上旁观取乐。隔了四天，两美军又在墙子河旁将一女丐推入河中淹毙。在北京，九月十九日，一个中国农民任义庄，行经西苑飞行场附近时，被美军守卫击毙。九月二十六日晚，美军一人竟闯入北京饭店二二九号中共驻平代表团女工作人员宿舍内，经严斥始狼狈逃逸。
    为南京人民所切齿痛恨、永志不忘的美军溺毙纳凉居民的中和桥事件及殴伤小学师生十余人的新生小学事件，正是美军殴辱杀伤中国人民的无数事件中的两个例子。
            三、劫夺骚扰事件
    当美国侵略军疯狂地向汉城进攻时，麦克阿瑟这个屠夫曾这样地“鼓舞”他的士兵们：你们打下汉城以后，“汉城所有的女人都是你们的了；你们可以寄包裹回美国去”！美国侵略军的这种无耻兽行和强盗行为对中国人民说来，是完全不陌生的。下面是无数事例中的几个：
    一九四六年一月十二日，上海报载：美水兵一人入鞋商店，抢去皮鞋一双，店主追出，遭其击倒于地。同时，美军十余人在上海最热闹的南京路大新公司附近，结伙抢去行人的大衣手表等物。八月二十四日，上海报载：美军官在台湾侵吞我十五万美元之金条，该军官现在美国，仍逍遥法外。
    一九四六年九月四日的上海文汇报和九月十四日天津大公报都曾刊载了读者卜秋雪和于不平的控诉书，愤慨地陈述着被一群美军武装搜查和抢劫的经过。
    驻华美军抢劫中国人民财物的事件，仅据“官方”统计，单从一九四五年十月至一九四六年一月的一百天中，共发生九十起，几乎每天平均一起。
            四、污辱和强奸事件
    美军污辱和强奸我国妇女的事件更是罄竹难书，这群野兽们曾在足迹所到的中国的每个角落里，留下了可耻的痕迹，他们以压迫和欺侮“黑奴”的暴行对待中国人民。强奸事件中最大的是一九四六年十二月的北京的沈崇事件和一九四八年八月八日的汉口景明大楼集体强奸事件。尤其是沈崇事件，当时曾激起全国性的抗暴运动。为什么沈崇事件会激起那样普遍的愤怒呢？这正因为在这以前美军的强奸暴行已经遍地皆是，已经使全国爱国人民忍无可忍，而终于爆发出积压的仇恨。当时在城市街头，美军公开抢拖妇女载上吉普而去的，以及公开闯入民家污辱妇女的，尤非常普遍。例如：一九四六年三月十五日，上海新昌路邓姓女子由外归家，竟被四个美兵跟踪闯入，强行奸淫。六月二十八日，重庆美兵四名，竟公然闯入会仙大厦旅社女浴室，对正在沐浴的妇女百般侮辱，复纠集美兵二十余人将旅社大肆捣毁。九月三日，南京一个妇女给一个报馆的信中说：“我在家乡沦陷时，曾遭六个鬼子侮辱，千辛万苦逃出来。不幸现在又被高鼻子‘盟军’施以非礼……”
        ×                      ×                        ×
    以上所举的例子，不过是千万件美军暴行中的寥寥数件，但仅从这些例子中，已可以看出美国侵略者对待中国人民的态度是完全和日本侵略者一样的，都同样把中国土地当作是他们自己的花园，把中国人民当作他们自己的奴隶。同时，今天的美国侵略者不但完全代替了昨天的日本侵略者的地位，而且比日本侵略者更残暴、更贪婪、更无耻，是“有过之而无不及”的。因为日本侵略者的侵略是露骨的，蛮干的；而美国侵略者的一切侵略行为，却都套着美丽的外衣。昨天的日本侵略者和今天的美国侵略者对于奴役中国的目的是相同的，而更坏的在于昨天的日本是花脸的强盗，狰狞面目是容易看出来的；而今天的美国侵略者却是戴着假面，穿着伪装，打着天蓝色的“联合国”的旗帜。可是，中国广大的人民是不会永远被蒙蔽欺骗的，因为他们曾是直接的受害者，如沈崇、臧大咬子的家属，以及南京的中和桥被溺毙者的家属，被殴打致伤的新生小学的师生等，以及其他美军无数暴行的身受者和目击者……不论残暴的侵略者打着什么招牌，穿着什么外衣，说着什么谎言，是永远能清楚地看出他们的“庐山真面目”的。今天，当美国侵略者又企图再一次闯入我们祖国的国土，进行再一次的暴行的时候，在广大人民一致起来要求复仇的火焰下，侵略者是终将被烧得粉身碎骨的！
