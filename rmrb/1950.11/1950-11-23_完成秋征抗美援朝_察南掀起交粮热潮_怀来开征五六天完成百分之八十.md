    Completing the Autumn Grain Collection to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea
    Chahar South Sets Off a Grain Delivery Upsurge
    Huailai Completes 80% of Collection in Five or Six Days
    [This newspaper, Chahar South] The Chahar South region, because each county used great effort to publicize the situation, combined with mobilizing the masses to actively deliver grain, enabled the broad masses of farmers, inspired by patriotic enthusiasm to resist US aggression and aid Korea, to universally set off an upsurge in paying public grain. From the start of collection on November 6th and 7th to the 12th, Xuanhua delivered 3.21 million jin to the granary, Huailai 4 million jin, Yu County 3.35 million jin, Wanquan completed 1.5 million jin to the granary, Yangyuan completed 1.8 million jin, Zhuolu 3.57 million jin, and Longguan 610,000 jin. Most of the grain is dry, clean, fine, and new. The masses in Chengguan, Huailai, upon hearing that the American imperialists were about to attack our doorsteps, rushed to deliver public grain. The masses in Yu County deeply hated the American imperialists. The 10th District, from the start of collection on November 6th to the 8th, delivered 648,000 jin to the granary, completing 62% of the total amount. In the 11th District, Li Jiazhen organized all the labor and animal power in the entire village and completed the entire 12,880 jin of public land grain to be paid on November 6th within one day. The Party members of Beixiji Village in the 4th District wrote a letter to Chairman Mao, saying, "We must complete the public grain ahead of schedule to support the Korean People's Liberation War." Farmers in Bunanbu in the 2nd District, upon hearing about resisting US aggression and aiding Korea, ran to the granary to inquire on November 5th before the collection even started. Farmers in various places have demonstrated their greatest love for the motherland in this year's public grain payment.
    The upsurge of grain delivery by farmers in Chahar South, in addition to being encouraged by patriotic enthusiasm for resisting US aggression and aiding Korea, is also due to the universal practice of determining tasks based on the burden-bearing capacity of counties and districts in terms of burden allocation.
    Reasonable adjustments were made early before the allocation of public grain, thus achieving fairness. In addition, the mobilization of human and animal power in transportation in various counties also played a decisive role in the rapid entry into the granary.
    However, there have also been incidents of sabotage by bandits, secret agents, and reactionary landlords in a few areas. Fortunately, due to high vigilance, their conspiracy did not succeed. For example, Zhang Quansheng, a landlord, and Zhang Shiyuan, a hooligan, in Lujialiang, Xuanhua, planned with some idlers in the temple on October 16 to organize resistance to grain; and they propagated to the masses to hide the grain and not hand it over, and also carried out malicious slander and insulting propaganda against the government. After being discovered, the government has detained them. In Renjiazhuang, 6th District, Yu County, reactionary rich peasants, enemies, and puppet elements Yan Chang, Bai Zhang, and others wanted to replace the village chief at the collection meeting, attempting to shift and disrupt the autumn collection, but their attempt failed after being exposed. Only Li Yinyou in Yinwo Temple, 13th District, had 400 bundles of naked oats that had not been threshed, and 200 bundles were burned by special agents, who have not yet been captured.

    [This newspaper, Chahar South] At the Fourth People's Representative Conference of All Circles in Huailai County, the representatives, after hearing about the crimes of aggression by the American imperialists, were extremely indignant. At the county's autumn grain collection meeting, they all expressed their firm support and implementation of the county people's government's "Report on the Draft Plan for Autumn Grain Collection Allocation," and made every effort to mobilize the people of the county to resist US aggression and aid Korea and defend world peace with practical actions to successfully complete the autumn grain collection task. After discussion, a unanimous resolution was passed to ensure that: (1) democracy is highly promoted, distribution is fair, disaster reduction is reasonable, and appropriate care is given to the families of martyrs, soldiers, and workers with no labor and the poor households without burden-bearing capacity, and the production policy of rewarding intensive farming is conscientiously implemented. (2) The quality of the grain must be new, dry, clean, and fine. (3) The autumn grain collection will be completed before November 25. (4) There will be no violations of policies such as coercive orders and tailism, and the masses will be deeply mobilized and enlightened to actively pay grain, and they themselves will serve as model workers or grain payers in the autumn grain collection work. Cadres of districts and villages also conducted challenge competitions. In the first five or six days of the start of the collection, 80% of the total task had been completed. The majority of villages have completed the task, demonstrating a high degree of patriotic enthusiasm.

    完成秋征抗美援朝
    察南掀起交粮热潮
    怀来开征五六天完成百分之八十
    【本报察南讯】察南地区由于各县用大力宣传形势，结合动员群众积极交粮，使广大农民在抗美援朝爱国热情激发下，普遍掀起交纳公粮热潮。从十一月六、七日开征至十二日，宣化入库三百二十一万斤，怀来四百万斤，蔚县三百三十五万斤，万全完成一百五十万斤入库，阳原完成一百八十万斤，涿鹿三百五十七万斤，龙关六十一万斤。大部粮食干、净、细、新。怀来城关群众听到美帝要打到大门上来了，即抢着交公粮。蔚县群情痛恨美帝，十区十一月六日开征至八日即入库六十四万八千斤，完成全部百分之六十二。十一区李家砧组织全村所有劳、畜力十一月六日一天内完成应纳公地粮一万二千八百八十斤的全部。四区北洗冀村党员给毛主席写信说：“要提前完成公粮、支援朝鲜人民解放战争。”二区卜南堡农民听到抗美援朝，在十一月五日未开征前即跑到粮库打听。各地农民在今年公粮交纳上都表现了对祖国的最大热爱。
    察南农民掀起交粮热潮，除为抗美援朝的爱国热情所鼓舞外，还由于在负担分配上普遍作到根据县区负担能力确定任务。
    在分配公粮前及早进行合理调整，因而达到公允。另外各县在运输上，发动人畜力，在入库迅速上也起到决定作用。
    但也有少数地区发生匪特、反动地主进行破坏的事件。幸由于警惕性高，其阴谋未得逞。如宣化吕家梁地主张全生、流氓张士元，十月十六日与一些二流子在庙内计划，要组织抗粮；并向群众宣传要把粮藏起不交，还对政府进行恶意诬蔑及侮辱性的宣传。经发觉后，政府已将其扣押。蔚县六区任家庄，反动地富、敌伪分子阎昌、白章等六人在征收会议上要换村长，企图转移破坏秋征，经揭发后未达企图。只有十三区银窝寺李印有莜麦四百个未打，被特务烧了二百个，还未捕获。

    【本报察南讯】怀来县第四次各界人民代表会议上，代表们听到了美帝的侵略罪行后，都极其愤恨，在县布置秋征会议上，均表示坚决拥护和执行县人民政府的“秋征分配草案之报告”，竭力动员全县人民，以胜利完成秋征任务实际行动，抗美援朝，保卫世界和平。并经讨论后一致决议，保证作到：（一）高度发扬民主，分配公平，减灾合理，适当照顾无劳力的烈、军、工属及无负担能力的贫苦户，认真贯彻奖励精耕细作的生产政策。（二）粮食质量要新、干、净、细。（三）在十一月二十五日前完成秋征。（四）不发生违犯政策的强迫命令和尾巴主义，深入的动员启发群众积极交纳，自己充当秋征工作中的模范工作者或纳粮者。各区、村干部又进行了挑战竞赛。在开始征收五、六天当中即已完成总任务的百分之八十。其中大部村庄已完成任务，表现了高度的爱国热情。
