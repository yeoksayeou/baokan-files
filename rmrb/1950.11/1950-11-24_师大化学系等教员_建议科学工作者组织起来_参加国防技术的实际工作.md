　　Teachers of the Chemistry Department of Beijing Normal University and Others
    Suggest That Scientific Workers Organize Themselves to Participate in the Actual Work of National Defense Technology
    [Report from this newspaper] The Chemistry Department Group of the Beijing Normal University Committee of the China Education Union and others suggest that scientific workers organize themselves to participate in national defense technology work, and use practical actions to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea to defend the country. The group, in view of the current historical task of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea to defend the country, believes that it is not enough for scientific workers to bury themselves in their work individually, as they cannot directly participate in the volunteer army due to the actual environment. It proposes that scientific workers should immediately organize themselves to participate in the actual work of national defense technology, so that they can use what they have learned to the best of their abilities, and support Korea with practical actions. This proposal was immediately enthusiastically supported by the physics, biology, geography, mathematics and other departments of the school. It is now suggesting to the Beijing Education Union and the Beijing Federation of Natural Science Specialized Societies to establish a working body for scientific workers to participate in national defense technology, in order to organize and lead this work.

    建议科学工作者组织起来
    参加国防技术的实际工作
    【本报讯】中国教育工会师大委员会化学系小组等建议科学工作者组织起来，参加国防技术工作，以实际行动，抗美援朝保家卫国。该小组因鉴于在目前抗美援朝保家卫国的历史任务下，科学工作者由于实际环境不能直接参加志愿军，但仅个别埋头进行工作是不够的，提议科学工作者应即组织起来，参加国防技术的实际工作，以便各就所习，尽其所长，以实际行动支援朝鲜。这一提议立刻得到了该校物理、生物、地理、数学等各系小组的热烈赞同。现正向北京市教育工会及北京市自然科学专门学会联合会建议成立科学工作者参加国防技术的工作机构，以便组织和领导这一工作。
