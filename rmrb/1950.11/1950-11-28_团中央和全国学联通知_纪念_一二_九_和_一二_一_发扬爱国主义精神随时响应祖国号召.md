Xinhua News Agency, 27th: The Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League and the All-China Students' Federation recently jointly issued a circular commemorating the "December 9th" Movement and the "December 1st" Movement. The original text is as follows:

    The fifteenth anniversary of the "December 9th" Movement and the fifth anniversary of the "December 1st" Movement are approaching. Students across the country and Youth League members in schools should enthusiastically commemorate these two glorious festivals of the Chinese student movement.

    The "December 9th" Movement fifteen years ago not only sparked a high tide in the Chinese people's anti-Japanese national salvation movement but also mobilized and educated a vast number of patriotic youths to bravely participate in the armed struggle against Japan, playing an important role in developing guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines and creating anti-Japanese base areas. On December 1, 1945, students in Kunming resolutely opposed the anti-popular civil war launched by the Kuomintang reactionaries under the instigation of American imperialism, likewise demonstrating the heroic revolutionary spirit of Chinese students. Now, as we commemorate "December 9th" and "December 1st," we must call on students across the country to inherit the glorious traditions of "December 9th" and "December 1st," promote the spirit of patriotism among young people, and actively participate in the movement to resist America, aid Korea, and defend our homes and country. We must call on students across the country not only to study hard in schools, master knowledge and technology, but also to be ready to respond to the motherland's call at any time, and to participate in national defense construction and consolidate national defense strength with practical actions.

    Youth League organizations and student federations in various localities should, in accordance with the spirit of this notice, adopt various appropriate methods to conduct extensive and in-depth publicity activities for the two festivals of "December 9th" and "December 1st," so that this commemoration will not only become a vivid and practical self-education for all students, but also a powerful impetus to strengthen national defense construction.

　　团中央和全国学联通知
    纪念“一二·九”和“一二·一”     
    发扬爱国主义精神随时响应祖国号召
    【新华社二十七日讯】中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会、中华全国学生联合会顷联合发表纪念“一二·九”运动和“一二·一”运动的通知，原件如下：
    “一二·九”运动的十五周年和“一二·一”运动五周年纪念日即将到来，全国学生和学校中的青年团员，应该热烈地纪念中国学生运动的这两个光荣节日。
    十五年前的“一二·九”运动不但掀起了中国人民抗日救国运动的高潮，而且发动和教育了广大爱国青年英勇地参加了抗日的武装斗争，在发展敌后游击战争和创造抗日根据地的工作中，起了重要作用。一九四五年十二月一日，昆明学生坚决反对国民党反动派在美帝国主义指使下发动的反人民内战，同样表示了中国学生英勇的革命斗争精神。现在我们纪念“一二·九”和“一二·一”，就是要号召全国学生继承“一二·九”、“一二·一”的光荣传统，发扬青年的爱国主义精神，积极参加抗美援朝保家卫国的运动；就是要号召全国学生不但要在学校中努力学习功课，掌握知识技术，而且要随时准备响应祖国号召，以实际行动来参加国防建设，巩固国防力量。
    各地青年团组织和学生联合会应按照本通知的精神，对“一二·九”和“一二·一”两个节日，采用各种适当的方式，进行广泛深入的宣传活动，使这次纪念活动不但成为对于全体学生的一次生动实际的自我教育，而且成为加强国防建设的一个有力推动。
