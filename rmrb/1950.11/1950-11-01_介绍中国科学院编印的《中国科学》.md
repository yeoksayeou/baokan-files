　　Introducing "Scientia Sinica" Compiled and Printed by the Chinese Academy of Sciences
    Chen Yiting
    In the past, due to China's political and economic status as a semi-feudal and semi-colonial country, its academic field inevitably reflected a strong semi-colonial character. In natural sciences, Chinese scientists often wrote their research results into papers in Western languages and submitted them to specialized magazines in capitalist countries such as Britain and the United States for publication. It can be said that almost all works with relatively important academic value were published abroad. Even some high-level specialized academic journals in China were mostly published in Western languages. Most scientific workers in China rarely had the opportunity to read research papers published in their own language. This fully demonstrated the dependency of China's scientific research in the past. Since liberation, scholars have generally improved their understanding and unanimously believe that the future academia of New China must be integrated with practice, fully demonstrate the spirit of independence, and academic papers should be completely published in the national language. Under this goal, the Chinese Academy of Sciences plays a major leading role; the creation of "Scientia Sinica" is a pioneer in this direction, and there is no doubt that it has epoch-making importance.

    "Scientia Sinica" is the main journal of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. It is a comprehensive academic quarterly, published once every three months. The first issue of the first volume was published in mid-September. The content includes sixteen papers on various natural sciences and one paper on social sciences, totaling about 230,000 words, with 39 large and small illustrations and photos and 17 plates, the entire volume reaching more than 270 pages.

    There are four papers in mathematics. The first is "Quasi-isomorphism of Rings and an Application to Projective Geometry" by Professor Hua Luogeng of Tsinghua University. Mr. Hua Luogeng is a famous mathematician; this is his first important work on "Number Field" published since returning to China this spring. The second paper is "Coefficients of Univalent Functions in the Unit Circle" by Professor Chen Jiangong of Zhejiang University, a senior figure in the Chinese mathematics community. This is a summary paper that briefly describes the main progress in the "coefficient" problem of univalent functions in the unit circle since 1909 over the past forty years. It not only points out many major problems that have not yet been solved, but also analyzes the extent to which each problem has been developed very clearly. It is a very valuable paper. The third paper, "A Theorem on p-groups" by Professor Duan Xuefu of Tsinghua University, is an important paper on group theory. The fourth paper, "Introducing a New Summation Method" by Professor Cheng Minde of Tsinghua University, introduces a new G-summation method for trigonometric series.

    "A New Graphical Method for Analyzing X-ray Powder Photographs" by Yin Pengcheng, a researcher at the Institute of Applied Physics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, is a paper on applied physics, with new improvements to the method of applying X-rays to analyze crystals.

    The article "China's Geomagnetic Field" by Zhu Gangkun, a researcher at the Institute of Geophysics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, briefly describes the past geomagnetic observation work in China and introduces the new geomagnetic map of East Asia he drew.

    The article "Frontal Activity in Spring in China" by Zhu Binghai, a professor in the Department of Meteorology at Nanjing University, analyzes the general situation of frontal activity in spring in China and cites some typical examples to illustrate it.

    "Small Mill Sesame Oil," a collaboration between Lou Chenghou, professor of the Department of Agricultural Chemistry at Beijing Agricultural University, and four others, introduces China's traditional and unique ingenious oil refining method, analyzes the scientific principle of its water-for-oil method, and indicates the improved path towards industrialized mass production. This is a very interesting and valuable paper with practical applications.

    The article "Distribution of Vitamin B1 and Nicotinic Acid in Rice Grains," a collaboration between Wang Yinglai, deputy director of the Institute of Physiology and Biochemistry of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and two others, analyzes the vitamin content of each part of rice grains after rice processing, provides a guide for rice processing, and incidentally points out the nutritional value of 92 rice stipulated by the government.

    "Conflicts in Identifying Stratigraphic Age with Animal Fossils and Plant Fossils" by Si Xingjian, a researcher at the Institute of Paleontology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, is a summary paper that criticizes the disputes among geologists and paleontologists regarding the identification of stratigraphic age based on ancient animal fossils and ancient plant fossils.

    "Morphology and Life History of the Echinostome Hypoderaeum conoideum (Bloch) Dietz, 1909" by Li Feibai of the Zhejiang Provincial Health Laboratory, is a very valuable paper on parasitic research, with detailed descriptions and discussions, and some originality.

    The article "Identification of Several Henosepilachna vigintioctopunctata in North China and Description of a New Species of Epilachna operculata" by Professor Liu Chongle of the Institute of Entomology at Beijing Agricultural University, discusses the sorting and naming of various Henosepilachna vigintioctopunctata, and describes the body shape characteristics and special hosts of several ladybugs. This is a paper that helps eliminate ladybugs and increase agricultural production.

    "The Relationship between Water Increase and Maturation of Frog Eggs," a collaboration between Zhu Xi, director of the Department of Developmental Physiology at the Institute of Experimental Biology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Yuan Bowen, is a very valuable paper in developmental physiology. Although the problem of water in eggs has been studied by others, no one has previously paid attention to the relationship between changes in water in eggs and the problem of egg maturation. Based on the results of experimental research, the authors of this article prove that in amphibian eggs, the absorption and increase of water is the main key to egg maturation. The insights are quite unique.

    The article "Study on Ciliary Movement on Salamander and Frog Embryos" by Tong Dizhou, deputy director of the Institute of Experimental Biology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, provides a very detailed discussion of the epidermal ciliary movement of amphibian embryos during the developmental period of each segment after the closure of the neural folds.

    "The Impact of Cotton Aphid Infestation on Cotton Plant Growth and Cotton Production Quality," a collaboration between Zhu Hongfu and Zhang Guangxue, deputy directors of the Institute of Entomology at the Institute of Experimental Biology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, is a paper with practical value for cotton production, explaining the degree of cotton aphid infestation, and comparing the aphid resistance of Sizi No. 4 cotton and Sizi 2B cotton before aphid control and the effects after aphid control in detail. It proves that Sizi 2B cotton is more sensitive to aphid infestation than Sizi No. 4 cotton, which is a paper that helps solve practical problems.

    "A Pluralistic New Classification System of Angiosperms" by Hu Xiansu, a researcher at the Institute of Plant Taxonomy of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, is a comprehensive paper that discusses the advantages and disadvantages of various plant classification systems used in the past, sorts out the chaotic situation of angiosperm classification, and proposes a pluralistic new classification system.

    The last paper is "Study on the Materialist Fan Zhen in the Late Fifth Century," a collaboration between Hou Wailu, president of Northwest University, and Ji Xuanbing, professor of Shandong University. In this paper, the authors introduce the cosmology and logical thought of Fan Zhen, a materialist in China in the late fifth century, and his brave and resolute fighting spirit against Buddhism during the era of Buddhism as the state religion in the Northern and Southern Dynasties, pointing out the important position of this greatest heretical thinker in the history of Chinese medieval thought.

　　介绍中国科学院编印的《中国科学》
    陈一霆
    以往，由于我国在政治经济上是一个半封建半殖民地的国家，所以在学术上也就必然地反映着浓厚的半殖民地色彩。在自然科学方面，过去我国的科学家们多将他们的研究成果用西文写成论文，投到英美等资本主义国家的专门杂志上去发表，可以说，凡是比较重要的学术价值高的著作，几乎全都是在国外发表的；而国内的一些水平较高的专门性的学术刊物也差不多都是用西文出版的。在国内的大多数科学工作者们，反而难得读到用本国文字发表的研究论文。这十足表现了以往我国科学研究的附庸性。自从解放以后，学者们的认识普遍提高，一致认为今后新中国的学术一定要与实际结合，充分地发挥独立的精神，学术论文应该做到完全用本国文字发表的地步。在这一目标下，中国科学院起着主要的领导作用；《中国科学》的创刊就是朝着这个方向去做的先驱，毫无疑问地它具有着划时代的重要性。
    《中国科学》是中国科学院的主要期刊。它是一个综合性的学术季刊，每三个月出版一次。第一卷第一期已于九月中旬出版。内容包括各门自然科学论文十六篇和社会科学论文一篇，共计约有二十三万字左右，并附大小插图照片三十九帧及图版十七幅，全册篇幅达二百七十余页。
    数学方面的论文共有四篇。第一篇是清华大学教授华罗庚先生的《环之准同构及对射影几何的一应用》。华罗庚先生是有名的数学家；这是他今春回国以后首次发表的关于《数域》的重要著作。第二篇是我国数学界前辈浙江大学教授陈建功先生的《单位圆中单叶函数之系数》。这是一篇总结性的论文，简要地叙述了自一九○九年以来，关于单位圆中单叶函数的“系数”问题，四十年间的主要进展；不但指出了许多至今尚未解决的大问题，同时并对每一问题已发展到如何程度，都分析得很清晰。是一篇非常有价值的论文。第三篇，清华大学教授段学复先生的《关于ｐ群的一个定理》，是一篇关于群论的重要论文。第四篇，清华大学教授程民德先生的《介绍一个新的求和法》，介绍了关于三角级数的新的Ｇ求和法。
    中国科学院应用物理研究所研究员殷鹏程先生的《一个分析Ｘ射线粉末照相新的图解法》是一篇关于应用物理学方面的论文，对于应用Ｘ射线分析结晶体的方法有新的改进。
    中国科学院地球物理研究所研究员朱岗昆先生的《中国的地磁场》一文，简单扼要地叙述了以往在中国境内的地磁观测工作，并介绍其所绘制的东亚地磁新图。
    南京大学气象系教授朱炳海先生的《中国春季之锋面活动》一文，分析了中国境内春季锋面活动的概况，并举了一些典型的实例以资说明。
    北京农业大学农业化学系教授娄成后先生等五人合作的《小磨香油》，介绍了我国传统上特殊的巧妙炼油方法，分析了其用水替油法的科学原理，并指示了走向工业化大量生产的改良途径。这是一篇很有兴趣并有应用价值的论文。
    中国科学院生理生化研究所副所长王应睐先生等三人合作的《米粒中维生素乙、及烟草酸之分布》一文，分析食米加工后米粒各部分之维生素含量，提供了食米加工的指南，并附带指出政府所规定的九二米的营养价值。
    中国科学院古生物研究所研究员斯行健先生的《动物化石与植物化石鉴定地层时代的冲突性》是一篇总结性的论文，批判了各地质学家及古生物学家对于根据古动物化石与古植物化石鉴定地层时代的争论。
    浙江省立卫生实验院李非白先生的《棘口吸虫Hypoderaeum conoideum（Bloch）Dietz,1909之形态及生活史》，记述和讨论都很详细，并有创见之处，是一篇关于寄生虫研究方面的很有价值的论文。
    北京农业大学昆虫学研究所刘崇乐教授的《华北几种二十八星瓢虫的辨识和Epilachna operculata新种记述》一文，讨论了整理各种二十八星瓢虫的命名问题，并叙述了几种瓢虫的体形特征及特好寄主。这是一篇有助于治除瓢虫增加农业生产的论文。
    中国科学院实验生物研究所发生生理研究室主任朱洗先生和袁伯伟先生合作的《蛙卵水份的增加和成熟的关系》是发生生理学方面的一篇极有价值的论文。卵中水份问题，虽曾有人加以研究，但以前却没有人注意到卵中水份的变化和卵的成熟问题的关系。本文作者根据实验研究的结果，证明在两栖类卵中，水份的吸收增进，为卵子成熟的主要关键。见解颇有独到之处。
    中国科学院实验生物副研究所所长童第周先生的《蝾螈与青蛙胚胎上纤毛运动的研究》一文，对于两栖类的胚胎在神经摺闭合后各段发育时期的表皮纤毛运动，做了很详尽的论述。
