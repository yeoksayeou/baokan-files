Title: In Memory of George Bernard Shaw

Xinhua News Agency reported on the 4th of this month, "The world-renowned British writer George Bernard Shaw unfortunately passed away on the 2nd due to illness, at the age of ninety-four." Shaw was born in 1856. He began writing in 1880, at the age of twenty-four, and never stopped until his death, spanning a total of seventy years. He initially wrote novels, later writing political and economic essays, music and drama reviews for newspapers and magazines, while also creating his own plays.

From the appearance of his first play in 1892 until now, fifty-eight years later, he has published a total of forty-some plays (the exact number is unavailable). From England to the European continent, from the Western Hemisphere to the Eastern Hemisphere, his influence can be said to have reached the entire world.

Shaw was a Fabian. Fabianism is a cautious and timid form of "socialism" that opposes radical revolution. This fact can help us understand Shaw's views and positions on economics and politics. Summarizing Shaw's thought and giving him a fair and accurate evaluation is a difficult task. The main reason is that his scope is too broad, his opinions too numerous, and his attitude both serious and humorous, with arguments sometimes leaning left and sometimes right, making it difficult to grasp a consistent thread. When people hear the name George Bernard Shaw, they often first associate him with being a most humorous writer, and the series of meanings that the term "humor" evokes in people's minds are often: joking, telling witty remarks, not being serious enough about life, lacking a fighting spirit, and so on. Shaw was an extremely humorous person, which is indeed a fact, but it would be incorrect to say that he was not serious enough about life or lacked a fighting spirit. In fact, Shaw's attitude towards life was very serious, sometimes almost with a religious flavor. He was usually not quick-tempered, but as soon as he saw all kinds of ugly, hypocritical, deceptive, persecutory, and brutal crimes in the world, he would immediately be filled with anger and rise up to attack them.

In his plays, he depicted how landlords of slum housing exploit the poor; he depicted how men and women of so-called high society ran brothels while maintaining their status; he depicted how munitions factory owners incited wars, trading other people's lives for their own profits; he depicted how religious organizations pretended to be benevolent, using bread to deceive souls; he also depicted how marriage is merely a commercial transaction in capitalist society. He opposed imperialist wars and mocked the popular superstition of worshiping soldiers. The famous European opera "The Chocolate Soldier" was adapted from one of his plays because the soldier carried chocolate instead of bullets when he went to battle. He also satirized the world's view of so-called historical heroes and great men, and he wrote two plays with such content, one about the ancient Roman Caesar the Great and the other about the modern French Napoleon. In the latter play, he even used Napoleon's voice to describe the character of "the English," speaking with great pleasure and without reservation. That passage is very flavorful, and I have translated a few sentences:

"When an Englishman wants to take something from someone, he never tells himself that he wants it. He patiently waits until one day, somehow, a serious principle suddenly comes to his mind, saying that it is his moral and religious duty to conquer the owners of the thing he wants... He takes on the identity of a champion of freedom and national independence to conquer and annex half the world, an act he calls colonial policy. When he wants to find a market for his inferior Manchester goods, he sends a priest to that place to preach the gospel of peace. The locals kill the priest, and he immediately picks up guns to defend the teachings of Christ, fight for Christ, and conquer others for Christ, eventually seizing a market as God's reward... No matter how bad or how good something is, there is always an Englishman willing to do it, but you will never see an Englishman doing something wrong. Englishmen do everything with principles. He fights you based on the principle of patriotism; he steals your things based on the principle of doing business; he forces you into slavery based on the principle of empire; he bullies you based on the principle of manhood..."

Looking at the above words as a description of imperialist aggression against weak nations, it is very insightful and thorough, no wonder the ruling class in England often had a headache because of Shaw.

In philosophy, Shaw had a theory of evolution, and his theoretical basis was built on what he called the "life force," which uses women to hunt men, bring them together, and gradually improve humanity, completing its own mission. However, Shaw did not make it clear what this "life force" is and how it can make humanity evolve. Shaw did not understand that human evolution and the creation of civilization are the result of human labor and effort.

In politics, although Shaw was a social reformist, he consistently supported the Soviet Union, opposed fascism, and sympathized with the Chinese people's anti-imperialist and anti-feudal revolution.

In summary, Shaw had rich thoughts, keen senses, broad experience, and a sharp pen. He had a sense of justice, and he could not stand the evils of modern capitalist civilization. He hated the behavior of people bullying people and people exploiting people, but because he himself believed in individualism, distrusted the power of the masses, and did not know that if he wanted to eliminate the ugly crimes he hated, only by organizing the power of the people and carrying out a comprehensive revolution could he succeed. Shaw can be regarded as a warrior, but unfortunately he was a solitary warrior. In terms of Shaw's personal achievements, it seems a bit greedy to make more demands of him, but the mere fact that he made U.S. imperialism and its British vassals have a headache forever is enough for us to deeply admire him. Shaw was a friend of peace-loving people around the world, and his death is a great loss to us.

### 纪念萧伯纳

　　纪念萧伯纳  潘家洵
    新华社本月四日消息，“世界闻名的英国文豪萧伯纳不幸于二日病逝，享年九十四岁。”萧伯纳生在一八五六年，一八八○年他二十四岁的时候就开始写作，一直到死没有放下过笔杆儿，前后整个儿七十年。他最初写小说，后来写政治、经济的论文，给报纸杂志写音乐批评和戏剧批评，同时自己创作剧本。
    从一八九二年第一个剧本出世直到现在五十八年中间，他一共发表了四十几个剧本（手头没有资料不能指出确数），从英国到欧洲大陆，从西半球到东半球，他的影响简直可以说是达到了全世界。
    萧伯纳是个费边主义者。费边主义是一种持重胆小，反对急进革命的“社会主义”。这个事实可以帮助我们了解萧伯纳在经济、政治上的见解和立场。想总结萧伯纳的思想，给他作个公平确切的估价是件繁难的事情。主要的原因是由于他的方面太广，他的意见太多，他的态度亦庄亦谐，议论或左或右，叫人不容易抓住一根一贯的线索。一般人听见了萧伯纳的名字往往首先联想到他是个最幽默的作家，而幽默这个名词在一般人心里引起的一串意思往往是：开玩笑，说俏皮话，对生活不够严肃，缺乏战斗精神，等等。萧伯纳是个极幽默的人，这一点确是事实，不过如果因此就说他对于生活不够严肃，缺乏战斗精神，那是很不正确的看法。其实萧伯纳做人的态度非常严肃，有时几乎有点宗教味道。他平素性子毫不暴躁，可是只要一看见世界上各式各样丑恶、虚伪、欺骗、迫害、残暴的罪行，他就会立刻怒气填胸，起而施以抨击。
    他在剧本里描写过贫民窟住宅的房东怎么剥削穷人；他描写过号称上流社会的男女怎么一面开妓院一面摆身份；他描写过军火厂主怎么鼓动战争，拿别人的性命换自己的利润；他描写过宗教团体怎么假仁假义，拿面包骗灵魂；他也描写过怎么在资本主义社会里婚姻只是一种商业交易。他反对帝国主义战争，挖苦崇拜军人的流行迷信。欧洲有名的歌剧《巧古力军人》就是拿他的一个剧本改编的，因为那个军人上阵时候身上不带子弹只带巧古力糖。他又讽刺世人对于历史上的所谓英雄伟人的看法，他有两个剧本就是这样的内容，一个是写古罗马的凯撒大帝，一个是写近代法国的拿破仑。在后一个剧本里他还借着拿破仑的嘴描写“英国人”的性格，说得痛快淋漓，毫不留情。那一段话十分有味，我现在挑了几句翻译出来：
    “一个英国人想拿人家一件东西的时候他决不跟自己说他想要那件东西。他耐着性儿等，等到有一天不知怎么一下子他心里来了个正经大道理，说是，去征服那些他想要的那件东西的主人正是他在道义和宗教上的责任。……他拿出自由和民族独立的拥护者的身份去征服，并吞半个世界，这种举动他叫作殖民政策。他想要给他的曼彻斯德劣等货物找个市场的时候他就派一名教士到那地方去宣扬和平福音。当地人把那教士杀掉，他就马上拿起枪炮保卫基督的教训，替基督打仗，替基督征服别人，结果夺取一个市场作为上帝给他的酬劳……一件事情无论怎么坏或者无论怎么好，总有英国人愿意去做，可是你永远不会看见英国人做错事情。英国人做什么事都有原则。他跟你打仗是根据爱国的原则；他抢你的东西是根据做买卖的原则；他逼你做奴隶是根据帝国的原则；他欺负你是根据男子汉大丈夫的原则……”
    把上面的几句话当作对帝国主义侵略弱小民族的描写看，是很精辟透彻的，难怪英国的统治阶级时常要为萧伯纳头痛。
    在哲学方面，萧伯纳有一套进化理论，他的理论基础建筑在他所说的“生命的力”上头，这种“生命的力”利用女人去猎取男人，把他们结合起来，把人类逐渐提高，完成它自己的任务。可是萧伯纳并没有交代清楚究竟这种“生命的力”是个什么东西，它又如何能够使人类进化。萧伯纳没看明白人类的进化跟文明的创造都是人类本身劳动努力的结果。
    在政治上，萧伯纳虽然是一个社会改良主义者，但是他一贯拥护苏联，反对法西斯主义，并且同情中国人民的反帝反封建革命。
    总起来说，萧伯纳有丰富的思想，有敏锐的感觉，有广博的经验，有锋利的文笔，他有正义感，他看不惯现代资本主义文明的罪恶，他痛恨人欺负人，人剥削人的行为，可是由于他自己信仰个人主义，不信任群众的力量，不知道如果要消灭他所痛恨的那些丑恶罪行，只有组织人民的力量，实行全面的革命才能成功。萧伯纳可以算得是个战士，可惜他是个孤独的战士。就着萧伯纳个人已有的成绩来说，如果对他提出更多的要求，我们似乎有点贪而无厌，不过仅就他的使美帝及其英国附庸永远头痛这一点而言，也足以叫我们深深钦佩了。萧伯纳是全世界和平人民的朋友，他的死是我们的一个巨大损失。
