    New Developments in Post-War Soviet Agriculture

    After the end of World War II, the Soviet government and the Soviet Communist Party put forward the important task of rapidly restoring and improving agriculture. Over the past five years, the Soviet people, with soaring labor enthusiasm, have restored 47 percent of the total cultivated land area that was destroyed by the war and greatly increased agricultural production. In 1948, the yield of grain per hectare exceeded the level of 1940, and the total grain harvest reached more than 7 billion poods. In 1949, the total grain harvest exceeded the pre-war level, reaching 7.6 billion poods.

    The speed of expanding the sown area stipulated in the post-war Five-Year Plan is much higher than that of the First Five-Year Plan, and large areas of land have been newly reclaimed in the countryside. By 1949, the cultivated area had increased by 37.6 million hectares compared with before the war. The total sown area in the second quarter of this year increased by about 6 million hectares compared with 1949. It should be pointed out that the cultivated land increased by the Soviet Union after the war alone is larger than the total cultivated land area of the major capitalist countries in Europe. According to the 1938 statistics, the cultivated land area in France was only 18.5 million hectares, Germany was 18.8 million hectares, and Italy was 11.1 million hectares.

    The extensive mechanization of Soviet agriculture has guaranteed a new upsurge in the development of Soviet agriculture after the war. In 1949, Soviet agriculture obtained 150,000 tractors (each with 15 horsepower), 29,000 combine harvesters, 64,000 trucks, and more than 1.6 million attached tools and other agricultural machinery, which is two to three times more machinery than in 1940. The mechanization of Soviet agriculture already exceeded that of the United States before the war. In 1940, the number of combine harvesters owned by the Soviet Union was twice that of the United States. In 1948, the working efficiency of Soviet tractors was four times higher than that of the United States.

    The scale of electrification in the Soviet Union also ranks first in the world. In 1948, the capacity of rural power stations exceeded that of the pre-war period by one time. More than 3,500 power stations were completed last year, and the number of electrified collective farms has doubled compared with before the war. In the past year alone, the number of electrified farms has increased tenfold compared with 1940. The hydroelectric and thermal power generators built in the first half of this year are equivalent to twice the number in the same period last year. This year, Soviet agriculture will have 800,000 generators, while the United States has only 500,000. By the end of this year, the collective farms, state-owned farms, and machine tractor stations in the Soviet Union will all be electrified.

    In order to conduct large-scale agricultural operations more widely, Soviet farmers launched a movement to merge collective farms in many parts of the country this year. In Ukraine, 9,182 small collective farms were merged into more than 3,700 large collective farms. Because large collective farms can use more machinery and scientific technology, farmers' income is expected to increase two to three times. Large-scale rural cities are also being built.

    The decision issued by the Soviet Council of Ministers on August 20 regarding the adoption of new irrigation systems to make fuller use of irrigated land and improve power farming, and the construction of the world's largest water conservancy projects such as the Kuibyshev and Stalingrad Hydropower Stations and the Turkmen Main Canal, which are about to begin construction, will enable the Soviet people to achieve even greater new victories in the struggle to further develop socialist agriculture, both in terms of irrigation and agricultural electrification.

### 战后苏联农业的新发展

    战后苏联农业的新发展
    第二次世界大战结束后，苏联政府和苏联共产党提出了迅速恢复并提高农业的重要任务。五年以来，苏联人民以高涨的劳动热情，恢复了被战争破坏的占总耕地面积百分之四十七的地区，并大大提高了农业生产。一九四八年每公顷的谷物产量，即已超过了一九四○年的水平，谷物的总收成，达到七十亿普特以上。一九四九年谷物的总收获量，更超过了战前水平，达到七十六亿普特。
    战后五年计划所规定的播种面积扩大的速度，比第一个五年计划高得多，农村中已新开垦了大片土地。到一九四九年，耕地面积已比战前增加了三千七百六十万公顷。今年第二季的全部播种面积，又比一九四九年增加约六百万公顷。应该指出：苏联仅在战后增加的耕地，就比欧洲主要的资本主义国家的耕地总面积为大。根据一九三八年的统计，法国耕地面积仅为一千八百五十万公顷，德国为一千八百八十万公顷，意大利为一千一百一十万公顷。
    苏联农业的广泛机械化，保证了战后苏联农业发展的新高潮。一九四九年，苏联农业获得十五万部拖拉机（每部以十五匹马力计）、二万九千部联合机、六万四千部载重汽车、一百六十万部以上的联带工具及其他农业机器，即比一九四○年多得了二倍至三倍的机器。苏联农业的机械化，战前即已超过美国。一九四○年，苏联拥有的联合机数目，为美国的两倍。一九四八年，苏联的拖拉机工作效力，较美国高出四倍。
    苏联电气化的规模也占世界第一位。一九四八年的农村发电站的能力，已超过战前一倍。去年落成的电力站达三千五百余所，电气化的集体农场，较战前增加了两倍。仅在去年一年中，电气化的农场就比一九四○年增加了十倍。今年上半年所建造的水力与热力发电机，相当于去年同期的两部。今年苏联农业将拥有八十万部发电机，而美国只有五十万部。到今年年底，苏联的集体农场、国营农场与机器拖拉机站，将全部电气化。
    苏联农民为了更广泛地进行农业的大规模经营，今年在全国许多地方展开了集体农场的合并运动。在乌克兰就有九千一百八十二个小集体农场合并为三千七百多个大集体农场。由于大集体农场可以更多地使用机器与科学技术，因此农民的收入可望增加二倍至三倍。大规模的农村城市也正在建设起来。
    今年八月二十日苏联部长会议发布的关于采用新的灌溉系统，以更充分利用受灌溉的土地并改良动力耕种的决定，和即将开工兴建的古比雪夫、斯大林格勒水电站与土库曼大运河等世界最大的水利工程，无论在灌溉方面和农业电气化方面，都将使苏联人民在进一步发展社会主义农业的斗争中，获得更为伟大的新胜利。
