Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, 18th (TASS): Soviet writer Fadeyev delivered a speech at the afternoon session of the Second World Peace Congress on the 17th, as follows:

　　Allow me to express my sincere gratitude to the peace-loving friends of Poland, to all the Polish people and their government, for the hospitality they have extended to us—the peace warriors of the world—in Poland. And I also pay tribute to our British friends, who have done everything in their power to enable good people to shake hands in Sheffield; it is not the fault of the British peace friends that the Peace Congress could not be held in Sheffield, because the current British government, or at least those government officials who have sufficient power to do so, are increasingly dragging their people onto the path of war against the interests of the British nation.

　　There is a huge difference between the British people's efforts to strive for peace and the bellicose spirit of their government, as illustrated by the British government's ban on holding the congress in Sheffield.

　　　　The Stockholm Appeal traveled through seventy countries and shook the hearts of millions of people in all countries
　　There are no fewer peace friends in Britain than in other countries, but not all of them realize how real the danger of war is. Now they are convinced that their government is heading for war, and their government is even afraid of world-renowned scientists Joliot-Curie, composer Shostakovich, and Elder Brierley. British peace friends have once again seen that their government fears most all the peaceful aspirations of its own people, lest the good people of Britain reach an agreement with the good people of other countries based on the principle of peaceful coexistence of all countries and nations. We are meeting at a time when the effort to strive for peace has become a most indomitable movement. This has been demonstrated by the unprecedented victory of the Stockholm Appeal signature campaign. Never in world history has there been such an oath that could travel through seventy countries and shake the hearts of millions of people in all countries.

　　The Stockholm Appeal movement shows that people who are very different in social development, religion, and cultural viewpoints have reached a consensus on the basis of concrete proposals to consolidate the cause of world peace. We, the Soviet people, are still very willing to accept any reasonable proposal in the future, no matter who proposes it, as long as it helps to consolidate world peace. We, the Soviet people, are very willing to reach an agreement with all true peace friends in the United States, Britain, Canada, the Scandinavian countries, and any country in the world, no matter what differences we have in our domestic political systems and in our general concepts of international life. We are also very willing to reach an agreement on any specific peace proposal, and we are willing to seek a consensus on any issue, as long as joint action can benefit peace on this basis. The possibility of such joint action by peace friends has by no means been exhausted. On the contrary, we who are gathered here must put forward broader, more explicit, more easily understood, more concrete and more practical proposals, so that it can unite peace advocates all over the world and curb those who are keen to expand the war.

　　Another world war is already knocking on the door. It is useless to guess whether the time when this war breaks down the door is near or far, and steps must be taken to avoid war.

　　Did Korea ever try to seize American territory? Who refused to listen to the representations of the Korean representatives?
　　We have seen so clearly in the past few months how a great power, ruled by a group of people who have enjoyed all the wealth and happiness in the world, has turned another country with thirty million people but a long history into ruins and ashes. Cities and ancient cultural relics have been razed to the ground, and the people's fields have been turned into scorched earth and trampled, this nation is known for their extraordinary diligence, even among the most diligent nations.

　　That country is flowing with the blood of children. The horrors of various fascist atrocities tried in the Nuremberg trials have reappeared before the eyes of the suffering Korean mothers. Has Korea ever been an aggressive country in history? Was Korea a member of the aggressive group in the last world war? Has Korea ever tried to seize the territory of the United States? None of them. This is a country that has long suffered under the iron heel of Japanese imperialism, a country that saw the prospect of a free life for the first time after the Allies won World War II. As for North Korea, it has established more schools, hospitals, and nurseries in the few years since its birth than Korea had established in many centuries.

　　Those people—I find it difficult to find a suitable word to describe those who ordered Korea to be razed to the ground—they still insist that North Korea should be responsible for the destruction of the entire country and the deaths of a large number of people. The president of the country that has done the most brutal deeds since the last war insists that this is his greatest contribution to the cause of peace.

　　I think Mr. President would be better off allowing a few ordinary Korean women to go to the United States, perhaps five would be enough; but these people cannot be chosen by Mr. President, but must be chosen by the people themselves, these five women, whether they grew up in the south or the north of the country, have experienced the past and present experiences of Korea. Let them speak freely in high schools and universities, in workers' gatherings, and in religious groups, let them only talk about their experiences and what they have seen with their own eyes. At the same time, all American newspapers can vigorously tout Mr. President's views on the so-called Korean issue. The entire propaganda machine of the American government can also operate at the same gathering as the Korean women, and can try to refute their words. It would be even better if MacArthur himself could appear with these women. Unless things are subjected to police interference, which is now commonplace in the United States, I am sure that every child and adult in the United States would rather believe Korean women than all the American newspapers and the entire propaganda machine of the American government; at the same time, MacArthur will expose his true face as a war criminal in front of all the American people. The reason for this is that the American people also love the truth most, and any upright people will be shocked to hear the truth about Korea.

　　I am a Soviet writer. Like millions upon millions of other people all over the world, I know how the American aggression against Korea began. Now, I am willing to talk to those who do not yet know what happened and who have different views on the beginning of the Korean incident. I can ask them a simple question: When the Korean issue was being discussed, who refused to listen to the representations of the Korean representatives, and why? Who refused to allow legitimate Chinese representatives to participate in the discussion of the Korean issue, and why? Who was unwilling to accept suggestions for solving the problem, and rejected them all regardless of their source, and why?

　　To send troops to ravage a country that poses no threat to you, to trample on anything living in this country, to make everyone know that you have no intention of withdrawing your soldiers' boots from this land at all, to refuse to talk to the representatives of the people of this country, to refuse any peace proposals on this matter, and to claim that you have made a great contribution to the cause of peace, all this, without the need for lawyers or diplomats, as long as ordinary people know, this is absolutely not allowed.

　　As soon as the Chinese people said that the Korean People's Army was not isolated, the aggressor was tied to Korea, and its victory was disillusioned
　　However, everyone can see very clearly: the American aggression in Korea has not become, and in the past could not, and cannot now become, a short, easy walk on the corpses of Korean women and children. The heroic Korean people have shown their unparalleled resistance, and at the same time, their neighbor and friend—the Chinese people—have openly declared: the Korean People's Army is not isolated. Therefore, the aggressor has been tied to Korea, and its victory, to put it nicely, is about to be achieved but is disillusioned again.

　　Indeed, the blood of American youth has been flowing in vain, and unless the problem is resolved peacefully, the blood of American youth will continue to flow endlessly. Anyone with a head now understands that the threat of a new worldwide conflict has already emerged at that location in Asia.

　　Is this situation in Korea unavoidable? Is it impossible to solve the so-called Korean issue peacefully? The whole world knows that since the day Japan was defeated in the last world war and Korea was liberated as a result, proposals for a peaceful settlement of the so-called Korean issue have been put forward more than once. Like all other countries, Korea has had and has the right to survive completely and independently. My country has repeatedly proposed that foreign troops must be withdrawn from Korea and that Korea should be unified into a complete country. North Korea has also repeatedly put forward such proposals, and all these documents have been published, and anyone who is willing to seriously treat this issue can see them.

　　After the end of the last world war, the United Nations organization appeared. Strictly speaking, its establishment was to solve such problems. It is precisely this organization that can and should promote a peaceful settlement of the Korean issue. But the good people of the world should understand that the forces keen on war are unwilling to peacefully solve the Korean issue, and the United Nations, instead of forcing these forces to enter into negotiations, has succumbed to such shameful behavior: using the flag of the United Nations to cover up the American armed intervention in the internal affairs of Korea.

　　Not long ago, we saw with our own eyes that the representative of one of the largest countries in Asia, Mr. Nehru, had put forward a proposal for a peaceful settlement of the so-called Korean issue with the participation of the Korean people themselves and with the participation of China, which is closely related to the fate of Korea. However, as the people had already expected, the aggressors turned a deaf ear to these proposals, and the United Nations not only did not use this new opportunity to peacefully solve the Korean issue, but instead supported the further development of the war under the cover of the United Nations flag.

　　War forces do not agree to a peaceful settlement of the German issue, and the United Nations has become a tool to encourage war forces
　　In view of the fact that we are facing another greater and more terrible conflict that is brewing and may directly develop into a worldwide disaster, the United Nations, to which the people of all countries had placed such great hopes, has become even more disgraceful. Here I am referring to the re-militarization of West Germany, the establishment of West German armed forces, and the handing over of command to Germans—and these Germans are precisely those who not long ago commanded the German fascist army to ravage many of the countries represented by the people gathered here today.

　　It is not necessarily just politicians, but as long as a person who understands the truth and has a little thought knows that there is no other way to solve the German issue except to conclude a peace treaty with a unified, democratic, and peace-loving Germany, and to withdraw all foreign troops from the country.

　　We need to recall how many simple, clear, and comprehensive proposals have been put forward in the past to finally peacefully solve the German issue—this central issue determines whether our children will enjoy the benefits of peace and labor or will bleed in the most terrible war that mankind has not experienced. Indeed, in Potsdam, the major powers had reached an agreement on this issue. The documents on which the United Nations was based must also guarantee everything necessary to solve the German issue in this only correct peaceful way.

　　However, the war forces are unwilling to agree to such a peaceful settlement of the German issue, and are currently establishing aggressive groups and alliances to drag a part of Germany—West Germany—into them, making it not only an ordinary participant in these bloody gambling games, but also the most active and powerful of the European partners. The governments of Western countries, following foreign orders, increase military budgets year by year, causing heavy burdens on the people; an unprecedented arms race is in progress, and various plans are being drafted to stipulate how many divisions of troops each country will provide in future wars of aggression. Even a "strong" country like Luxembourg seems to be providing as many troops as the United States. Obviously, when these foreign masters are deceiving their European partners with the illusion of easily winning with atomic bombs, they are unwilling to send troops. Obviously, no one pays attention to the opinions of ordinary soldiers in France, Britain, Belgium, West Germany, and Luxembourg, and it is they, not atomic bombs, who are bleeding for the American monopoly capitalists.

　　One would think that this is a good occasion to use all the tools that the United Nations can use to seek peace. Unfortunately, the United Nations has not met the expectations and wishes of the people in this regard. This organization has become a tool to encourage the forces of war—and because the encouragement of the forces of war is being disguised with hypocritical words of dedication to peace, it is an even more dangerous tool.

　　The Soviet delegation supports the Curie and Nenni proposals, advocating disarmament by major powers and strict prohibition of atomic weapons
　　This explains why I support the proposal of Mr. Joliot-Curie, the leader of our peace movement, that our Peace Congress should demand that the United Nations faithfully fulfill the responsibilities entrusted to it by the people of all countries, namely, to strengthen peace and organize peaceful cooperation between countries and nations. I also support the proposal of Mr. Joliot-Curie and Mr. Nenni, in which we, representing hundreds of millions of peace fighters all over the world, wrote to the United Nations saying: "Fulfill your responsibility to history and to mankind. If you do not fulfill this responsibility, the people of all countries in the world will not need you and will find other ways to reach an agreement." We are not trying to invent anything new, but we want to realize what was originally written on the banner of the United Nations. We demand the serious implementation of those declarations on peace, on disarmament, and on the prohibition of the use of tools of mass destruction of mankind (such as atomic weapons, chemical or bacterial weapons for combat). If the forces of war in the United Nations do not allow you to realize your declaration, then the people of all countries in the world, who are more numerous than the 500 million people who have already signed the Stockholm Appeal, will defeat the forces of war, will unite above you on the basis of peaceful cooperation, and will realize the true program of seeking lasting and lasting peace that represents the vital interests of the people of all countries.

　　That is why I want to support the suggestions made by Mr. Joliot-Curie and many other delegates to the congress, demanding the complete realization of the Stockholm Appeal's demand for the unconditional prohibition of atomic weapons and the declaration that the government that first uses such weapons is a war criminal. At the same time, I also support the proposal to expand the demand for the prohibition of atomic weapons to include the unconditional prohibition of chemical and bacterial weapons.

　　Regarding the demand in the Stockholm Appeal for the prohibition of atomic weapons, we have heard the argument that one type of weapon is dominant in some countries, while another type of weapon is dominant in other countries. Therefore, prohibiting one type of weapon will benefit one side and not the other. These words are deceptive, especially because in most cases these arguments come from the camp that is engaged in an unprecedented race in all types of weapons.

　　We—the people who advocate peace, the representatives of the majority of different countries in the world have pointed out that prohibiting atomic bombs and other weapons of mass destruction is the first extremely important step in establishing international peace cooperation. At the same time, the arms race in the production of any type of weapon and the increase in land, sea, and air armed forces not only bring heavy economic burdens to the people, but are also the source of war and may become tools of aggression. Past and modern history will convince the people of all countries of this.

　　I also intend to make some contributions to the peace legislation that the conference will formulate based on the constructive suggestions of some delegations. On behalf of my friends—the members of the Soviet delegation and myself, I put forward the following suggestions for the initial consideration of the conference committee:

　　It is hereby proposed in the name of the conference that in the period from 1951 to 1952, the major powers unanimously gradually reduce all armed forces, including land, air, and naval forces, with the amount of reduction gradually increasing from one-third to one-half of the existing strength.

　　Organize an international control agency under the auspices of the Security Council, which should have the authoritative supervisory power to supervise the implementation of disarmament and the prohibition of atomic, bacterial, chemical, and other weapons.

　　Effective international control agencies should not only have the right to control the armaments and weapons production that have been declared by each country, but also, at the request of the International Supervisory Committee, can investigate the production of planned weapons or the production of undeclared weapons.

　　第二届世界保卫和平大会上
    苏联代表法捷耶夫的演说
    【新华社讯】塔斯社华沙十八日电：苏联作家法捷耶夫在第二届世界保卫和平大会十七日下午会议上发表演说如下：
    请允许我向波兰的和平友人、向波兰全体人民及其政府表示真诚的感谢，感谢他们在波兰所给予我们——全世界的和平战士——的款待。我并且向我们的英国友人致敬，他们已尽了他们的一切能力使善良的人们能够在设菲尔德相互握手；保卫和平大会不能在设菲尔德举行，这不是英国的和平友人的过错，因为目前的英国政府，或者至少是那些有足够权力这么做的政府官员们，正在日益把他们的人民拖上违反英国民族利益的战争的途径。
    在英国人民争取和平的努力与他们的政府的好战精神之间有着巨大的差异，英国政府禁止大会在设菲尔德举行一事已经说明了这点。
            斯德哥尔摩宣言走遍七十个国家撼动了所有各国千百万人民的心
    在英国的和平友人并不少于其他国家，然而并不是他们全都认识到战争危险是多么真实。现在他们已经确信他们的政府正在走向战争的道路，他们的政府甚至于害怕世界闻名的科学家约里奥—居里，作曲家萧斯塔科维奇和布利埃长老。英国的和平友人再度看到了他们的政府最怕本国人民的一切和平热望，唯恐英国的善良人民与其他国家的善良人民根据一切国家与民族和平共存的原则获致协议。我们开会的时候正是争取和平的努力已成为一个最不屈不挠的运动的时候。这已由斯德哥尔摩宣言征集签名运动的空前胜利所证明。在世界历史上从来没有过这样一种誓愿，能够走遍了七十个国家，撼动了所有各国千百万人民的心。
    斯德哥尔摩宣言运动表明了：在社会发展、宗教和文化的观点上十分不同的人们，已在巩固世界和平事业的具体建议之基础上取得了一致的意见。我们苏联人民今后对于任何合理的建议，不论它是那一些人提出的，只要它对巩固全世界和平有帮助，仍是十分愿意接受的。我们苏联人民十分愿意与美国、英国、加拿大、斯堪的那维亚各国以及世界上任何国家的一切真正的和平友人取得一致的意见，不论大家对我们的国内政治制度和对国际生活的一般概念有什么分歧。我们也十分愿意在任何的具体和平建议上取得一致的意见，也愿在任何问题上寻求一致的决定，只要在这种基础上能够以共同的行动造福于和平。和平友人这种采取共同行动的可能性绝没有枯竭。相反的，我们在这会场集会的人必须提出广泛的、更明确的、更易为人人所了解的、更加具体更加实际的建议，使它能团结全世界的和平拥护者，遏止热中于扩大战争的人们。
    另一次世界大战已经在撞门了。猜测这个战争撞开大门的时间是远还是近，那是没有用处的，必须采取步骤来避免战争。
    难道朝鲜曾企图夺取美国领土吗？是谁拒绝听取朝鲜代表的申述呢？
    我们曾多么清楚地看见在过去几个月之中，一个由一群享尽了一切财富与尘世间的幸福的人们所统治的大国，把另一个有三千万人民但历史悠久的国家变为废墟，化为灰烬。城市和古代文化的遗迹已被夷为平地，人民的田地被化为焦土，被践踏蹂躏，这个民族甚至在最勤劳的民族中也是以他们非凡的勤劳著称的。
    那个国家流遍了孩子们的鲜血。曾在纽伦堡审判中所审理的各种法西斯暴行的恐怖都已在苦难深重的朝鲜的母亲们的眼前重新出现。难道在历史上朝鲜是一个侵略国家吗？难道在上次世界大战中朝鲜是侵略集团的一员吗？难道朝鲜曾企图夺取美国的领土吗？都不是的。这是一个曾长期在日本帝国主义的铁蹄之下备受奴役的国家，这是一个在盟国取得了第二次世界大战的胜利之后才第一次看见自由生活的前景的国家。至于北朝鲜，它在诞生以来的不几年期间建立了许多学校、医院和保育院，就比朝鲜多少世纪以来所建立的还要多。
    那些人——我觉得很难找到一个适当的字眼来形容那些下令把朝鲜夷为平地的人——他们还在硬说北朝鲜应该对整个国家的毁灭和大批人民的死亡负责。曾经干过自上次大战以来最凶残的勾当的国家的总统，却硬说这正是他对和平事业的最伟大的贡献。
    我认为，总统先生最好允许几名普通的朝鲜妇女到美国去，恐怕只要五名便够了；不过这些人却不能由总统先生挑选，而须由人民自己选出来，这五名妇女不管她们是在该国的南部或北部长大，但都经历过朝鲜过去和目前的遭遇。让她们在中学和大学里，在工人集会和宗教团体里自由地谈话，让她们只谈她们的经历，和她们曾经亲眼看见过的事情。同时美国全部报纸也可以极力吹捧总统先生对所谓朝鲜问题的见解。美国政府的整个宣传机器也可以和朝鲜妇女们在同一个集会上活动，可以想办法驳斥她们的话。假如麦克阿瑟本人能和这些妇女一道出现，那就更好了。除非事情遭到美国现在已司空见惯的警察干涉，我敢肯定地说，全美国的每一个孩子和成人都宁愿相信朝鲜妇女，而不会相信美国一切报纸和美国政府的整个宣传机器；同时麦克阿瑟将会在全体美国人民面前暴露出他的战争罪犯的真面目。其所以会这样，是因为美国人民也最爱好真理，也因为任何正直的人民将会由于听到朝鲜的真情而大吃一惊。
    我是一个苏联作家。正如全世界千千万万其他人民一样，我知道美国对朝鲜的侵略是怎样开始的。现在，我愿意和那些还不晓得事情到底怎样发生、同时对朝鲜事件的开端抱有不同见解的人谈一谈。我可以问他们一个简单的问题：当朝鲜问题正在讨论时，到底是谁拒绝听取朝鲜代表申述，为了什么？到底是谁拒绝有合法的中国代表参加讨论朝鲜问题，为了什么？到底是谁不愿接受解决问题的建议，而不论其来源如何一律加以拒绝，又是为了什么呢？
    派军队去蹂躏一个对你毫无威胁的国家，去践踏这个国家里任何活着的东西，使每一个人都晓得你根本无意叫你的士兵的皮靴撤出这片土地，拒绝和这个国家人民的代表交谈，拒绝关于这件事情的任何和平建议，却自命为对和平事业作了巨大的贡献，所有这些，不必要律师或者外交家，只要普通人就会知道这是绝对不能容许的。
    中国人民一说朝鲜人民军不是孤立的侵略者就被拴在朝鲜它的胜利幻灭了
    但是，每一个人都看得很清楚：美国在朝鲜进行的侵略，没有成为而且过去不能现在也不能成为在朝鲜妇孺尸体上作短程的轻松的散步。英勇的朝鲜人民已经表现出他们的无比的抵抗力量，同时他们的邻友——中国人民已经公开宣称：朝鲜人民军不是孤立的。因此，侵略者已被拴在朝鲜，它的胜利，说得好一些，是眼看要到手却又幻灭了。
    确实，美国青年的血已在白流着，而且除非问题获得和平的解决，美国青年的血还要无穷无尽地流下去。任何一个有头脑的人现在都明白：新的全世界冲突的威胁已经在亚洲的那个地点上出现了。
    难道朝鲜的这种情形是不可避免的吗？所谓朝鲜问题不能够用和平方式来解决的么？全世界都知道：自日本在上次世界大战中失败、朝鲜因而获得解放的第一天起，和平解决所谓朝鲜问题的建议已经不止一次地提出了。正像所有其他国家一样，朝鲜过去和现在都有权利完整地独立地生存下去。我的国家已经一再地提出必须从朝鲜撤退外国军队并使朝鲜统一为一个完整国家的建议了。北朝鲜也曾一再地提出这一类的建议，所有这些文件都已公布，任何一位愿意严肃地对待这个问题的人都可以看到。
    上次世界战争结束后，联合国组织出现了，严格说来，它的建立，就是为了解决这类问题的。丝毫不差地正是这个组织能够而且应该促进朝鲜问题的和平解决。但是全世界的善良人民应该明白：热衷于战争的势力不愿意和平解决朝鲜问题，而且联合国，不是强迫这些势力转入谈判，反而屈从于这样的可耻行为：用联合国的旗帜把美国对朝鲜内政的武装干涉掩盖起来。
    不久以前，我们亲眼看到亚洲最大国家之一的代表、尼赫鲁先生曾经提出一个由朝鲜人民亲自参加并有与朝鲜命运休戚相关的中国参加，来和平解决所谓朝鲜问题的建议。但是，正像人民所已经预料到的那样，侵略者对于这些建议充耳不闻，同时联合国不但没有利用这个新机会来和平解决朝鲜问题，反而支持以联合国的旗帜为掩护的战争的进一步发展。
    战争势力不赞同德国问题和平解决联合国已成了鼓舞战争势力的工具
    鉴于迫在我们面前有着正在酝酿成熟而且可能直接发展为全世界灾祸的另一次更大的可怕的冲突，全世界各族人民曾寄予如此重大希望的联合国，却显得更不体面了。这里我所指的是西德的重新军事化、西德武装部队的成立及交由德国人指挥，——而这些德国人正是不久以前指挥着德国法西斯军队蹂躏许多今天集会于此的人们所代表的国家的。
    不一定只是政治家、而只要是一个懂得道理和稍有思想的人都认识到：除了与统一、民主和爱好和平的德国缔结和约，除了撤出该国境内的一切外国军队以外，没有其他的方法来解决德国问题。
    我们有必要回想一下：过去曾提出过多少简单明了同时无所不包的建议以最后和平解决德国问题——这个中心问题决定我们的孩子们将享受和平和劳动的利益还是将在人类未经历过的最可怕的战争中流血。的确，在波茨坦，各个大国曾就这一问题达成过协议。联合国赖以产生的文献也一定保证了在以这个唯一正确的和平方法来解决德国问题上似属必要的一切。
    然而，战争势力却不愿赞同德国问题这样的和平解决，目前正在建立侵略集团和联盟，要把德国的一部分——德国西部——拖到它们里面，使之在这些血腥的赌博中不仅是一个普通的参与者，而且成为欧洲伙伴里面最积极最有力的一个。西方各国政府遵奉外国的命令，逐年增加军事预算，造成人民沉重的负担；空前的军备竞赛正在进展，并且正在草拟各种计划，规定每一个国家在将来侵略战争中提供多少师军队。甚至像卢森堡这样的“强”国似乎也要出像美国一样多的军队。显然，当这些外国主子们以原子弹轻易地取得胜利的幻想来欺骗他们的欧洲的伙伴们的时候，他们是不愿派遣军队的。显然没有人注意到法国、英国、比利时、西德、卢森堡的普通士兵的意见，而为美国垄断资本家流血的正是他们，不是原子弹。
    人们会以为这时候正是一个适当的场合可以运用联合国所能利用各种谋求和平的工具了。不幸得很，联合国在这一方面却不曾满足人民的期许和愿望，这个组织已成了鼓舞战争势力的工具——由于对战争势力的鼓舞是正在以献身和平的伪善措词掩饰起来的，所以它是更加危险的工具了。
            苏联代表团拥护居里和南尼提案主张大国裁军严格禁止原子武器
    这说明为什么我支持我们和平运动的领袖约里奥—居里先生的提案，即由我们的保卫和平大会要求联合国忠实地履行各国人民赋与它的职责，即加强和平、组织各个国家与民族间的和平合作。我也支持约里奥—居里先生和南尼先生的提案，我们代表全世界亿万和平斗士致书联合国说：“履行你对历史对人类的责任。如果你不履行这种责任，全世界各国的人民将用不着你而另外想法获致协议。”我们并没有要发明什么新东西，而我们却要实现当初写在联合国旗帜上的东西。我们要求认真地实行那些关于和平、关于裁减军备和关于禁止使用大规模屠杀人类的工具（如作战用的原子武器，化学或细菌武器等）的宣言。如果联合国内的战争势力不让你实现你的宣言，那么比已在斯德哥尔摩宣言上签了名的五亿人口还要众多的世界各国人民将击退战争势力，将超乎你之上而在和平合作的基础上团结起来，并实现那代表各国人民切身利益的、谋求稳固和持久和平的真正纲领。
    这就是为什么我要支持约里奥—居里先生及其他许多大会代表所提出的建议，要求彻底实现斯德哥尔摩宣言中关于无条件禁止原子武器并宣布第一个使用这种武器的政府为战犯的要求。同时，我也支持主张把禁止原子武器的要求加以扩大的建议，将无条件禁止化学武器与细菌武器也包括在内。
    关于斯德哥尔摩宣言中禁止原子武器的要求，我们听到一种论调说：一种类型的武器在某些国家占优势，而另一类型的武器在另外一些国家占优势，因此，禁止某一类型的武器将有利于一方，而不利于他方。这些话是骗人的，特别是因为在大多数情形下这些论调都是出自正在一切类型的武器上从事空前竞赛的阵营之中。
    我们——拥护和平的人们，世界上大多数不同国度的代表已经指出：禁止原子弹及其他大规模毁灭的武器，是建立国际和平合作的第一个极端重要的步骤。同时，生产任何类型武器的军备竞赛及陆、海、空武装部队的增加，不仅给人民带来了沉重的经济负担，并且是战争的渊薮，可能成为侵略的工具，关于这一点，过去和现代的历史会使各国人民相信的。
    大会将根据一部分代表团的建设性建议而制订和平法规，对此，我也打算有所贡献。我代表我的朋友们——苏联代表团团员和我本人提出下列建议，以供大会委员会作初步考虑：
    兹以大会名义建议：在一九五一年至一九五二年期间，各大国一致逐渐裁减包括陆、空、海军在内的一切武装部队，裁减量逐渐增加，由现有兵力的三分之一到二分之一。
    在安理会的主持下组织国际管制机构，它应具有权威的监督权，以监督裁减军备与禁止原子、细菌、化学等武器的执行。
    有效的国际管制机构不仅应有权管制各国所已宣布的军备以及武器生产，而且在国际监督委员会的请求下，可以调查计划中的武器或者调查没有宣布的武器的生产。
