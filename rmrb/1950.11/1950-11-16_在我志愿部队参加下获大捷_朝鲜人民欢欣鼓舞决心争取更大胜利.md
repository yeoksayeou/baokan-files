Xinhua News Agency, Northern Korea, 15th—A meeting celebrating the 33rd anniversary of the October Revolution was held in a certain area of northern Korea on the evening of the 7th. The chairman of the local Workers' Party committee gave a report on the current situation in Korea, calling on the Korean people to learn from the experiences of the Soviet and Chinese revolutionary wars, overcome all difficulties, and strive for final victory. When the reporter announced that the Korean People's Army, with the participation of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, had achieved a major victory on the northwest front, it immediately triggered thunderous cheers from the audience. The slogans "Long live General Kim Il-sung!" "Long live Chairman Mao Zedong!" "Long live Marshal Stalin!" and applause resounded throughout the venue like a storm. The reporter then called on the Korean people to fully support the heroic People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army in striving for even greater victories.

Subsequently, representatives of workers, peasants, youth, and women eagerly took to the stage to speak. Zheng Zuyu, a member of the Democratic Women's League, said in her speech: "The world peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union is our strong backing, especially the participation of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, which has greatly strengthened our confidence in victory. We women will intensify our efforts to sew cotton clothes for the soldiers and mobilize more sisters to go to the front to do rescue work."
