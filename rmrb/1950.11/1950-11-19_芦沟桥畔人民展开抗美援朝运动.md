    People on the Lugou Bridge Launch the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement
    By our reporter Lu Sheng
    Lugou Bridge, this famous and great architectural structure in Chinese history, has written a glorious page in the history of the Chinese people's struggle against imperialist aggression and for national liberation. Thirteen years ago, on July 7th, Japanese imperialism launched a full-scale invasion of China here; under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the entire Chinese people also launched a full-scale war of resistance, fighting hard for eight years until victory. Thirteen years ago, the patriotic Chinese soldiers stationed at Lugou Bridge, driven by the nationwide upsurge of resistance to Japan and national salvation, bravely resisted the provocations of the brutal and ferocious Japanese bandits; the people around Lugou Bridge, who had suffered all kinds of humiliation from the Japanese invaders, actively transported bullets and grain for the anti-Japanese army, powerfully supporting the war. However, when the patriotic soldiers had surrounded more than two thousand Japanese invaders in the Fengtai barracks and were about to annihilate them, the traitor Chiang Kai-shek ordered them "not to resist" and cut off their supplies, forcing hundreds of passionate patriotic men to retreat in pain and tears. From then on, the glorious Lugou Bridge was trampled under the beastly hooves of the Japanese invaders for eight years, and the people around Lugou Bridge fell into the abyss of suffering under the dark rule of the Japanese invaders.
    Before liberation, the people around Lugou Bridge suffered from the heavy oppression of imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries. During the period of Japanese occupation, more than half of the more than three thousand people in Wanping Town (located near Lugou Bridge) and Zhangguozhuang villages were forced to flee due to unbearable oppression. The remaining people who could not escape struggled to live a painful life under the threat of Japanese bayonets, building blockhouses and digging trenches for the Japanese invaders. When the Japanese invaders carried out the sixth "Strengthening of Public Security," people could only fill their stomachs with "mixed flour" and sweet potato peels. In a large courtyard in Wanping Town, hungry people were imprisoned because they begged on the streets, violating the Japanese invaders' "Strengthening of Public Security." At that time, more than ten starved corpses were dragged out of that courtyard every day with iron wires; on both sides of the Yongding River, one could often see bodies lying on top of each other and wild dogs eating the dead with bloodshot eyes. Zheng Yongquan, chairman of the Wanping Town Farmers' Association, recalled the tragic scene at that time: "At that time, there was no way for the Chinese people to live around Lugou Bridge; only the Japanese invaders and wild dogs ate very well!"
    After the Japanese invaders surrendered, the people around Lugou Bridge did not gain true liberation. The traitor Chiang Kai-shek usurped the fruits of the Chinese people's victory and attempted to sell China to American imperialism. Thus, the people around Lugou Bridge once again fell into the criminal rule of Chiang's bandit troops and American imperialism, and were forced to build blockhouses for the bandit troops while starving, and were captured to be cannon fodder. The sixty-four-year-old Jin Run and his family had just returned to the village, without food or drink. With great difficulty, they borrowed 150,000 yuan in pseudo-currency from relatives and friends and bought two packs of cigarettes to sell at a small stall by the Lugou Bridge. The next day, an American soldier in a jeep came to buy cigarettes. Because of the language barrier and a mistaken gesture, the American devil kicked him twice, scattering the cigarettes all over the ground. Jin Run was very heartbroken when he thought about this. He said: "When the American devil hit me, there was a policeman standing next to him, but that guy not only did not stop the American devil's brutality, but also scolded me and said I was 'making trouble,' and forbade me from selling cigarettes on Lugou Bridge in the future. I thought at the time: It's the Chinese people's Lugou Bridge, and Chinese people are not allowed to sell cigarettes, but foreign devils are allowed to hit people! I really wanted to argue with him, but then I thought: They are all in cahoots with the American devils, and arguing would be useless, so I had to swallow my anger and quickly pick up the scattered cigarettes and go home. When I got home, I was so angry that I couldn't eat, and my second son, Jin Wenyu, ran to the police station to ask the director. Who knew that he never came back after he left. It wasn't until the next day that I found out that he had been locked up by the police!" He pointed to a house in the center of the town and said: "The young people who were arrested at that time were all locked up in that courtyard. Just in Wanping Town and Zhangguozhuang, more than forty people were arrested." At this time, Lugou Bridge was just like during the period of Japanese occupation. Only the Rising Sun flag was replaced with the Stars and Stripes, American cars sped across the bridge, and on both sides of the bridge, American soldiers were playing duck-and-drake, with gunshots ringing out all day long, just like the Japanese invaders using Lugou Bridge as a target back then. The stone lions on the bridge that were destroyed by the Japanese bombing were still missing heads and feet, the houses on both sides of the bridge that were destroyed by the Japanese bombing were still dilapidated, and the people's lives were still extremely painful. After Jin Run's son, Jin Wenyu, was arrested by the bandit troops, Jin Run was even more unable to live, and had to rely on begging. Sometimes he was also arrested by the bandit troops to build blockhouses. However, under this cruel oppression, the people of Lugou Bridge launched a heroic struggle against the reactionaries. Jin Wenyu and Wang Yongshun from Zhangguozhuang and more than forty other young men were locked up in the courtyard in Wanping Town where the Japanese invaders had slaughtered the Chinese people. After colluding with each other, they killed the puppet police who were monitoring them one night, rushed out of Wanping Town, and joined the People's Liberation Army. From then on, under the influence of their revolutionary actions, the people around Lugou Bridge further launched a struggle against American imperialist elements and their running dog, Chiang's bandit troops.
    In 1948, Lugou Bridge was liberated by the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and the glorious Lugou Bridge once again belonged to the people. At this time, the people who had fled to other places returned to their hometowns one after another. Under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, land reform was implemented and production mutual aid was carried out. In just over a year, Lugou Bridge completely changed its appearance. Now, when you go to Lugou Bridge, you can no longer see the sad faces of three years ago. They are all happily singing songs and carrying out various productive labors cheerfully. The stone lions that were destroyed by the Japanese invaders in the past have now been replaced with new ones, and the inscriptions of "Lugou Xiaoyue" on the stone tablets have been repainted, making them appear particularly brilliant. The villages and houses on both sides of the bridge that were destroyed by the Japanese bombing have been repaired; Wanping Town has increased from more than one thousand people a year ago to two thousand people. Due to the implementation of land reform, poor peasants have been allocated land, and their lives are getting better day by day. Jin Run was allocated seventeen mu of good land. Last year, the grain harvested was enough for the family to eat, and he also repaired three houses. This year, the grain harvested is enough for another year, and life has begun to improve. He plans to save some grain this winter and buy a draught animal next spring.
    In late June of this year, when the working people around Lugou Bridge were busy carrying out production, they suddenly heard the news that American imperialism was attacking Korea and invading our country's Taiwan, which made them angry. On July 7th - a day that the people of Lugou Bridge and the people of the whole country will never forget - they held an anti-Japanese memorial meeting near Lugou Bridge. At the meeting, more than 80% of the people in the town signed the peace declaration. They unanimously swore: "Oppose American imperialist aggression and defend world peace." Now they know that American imperialism is still expanding its aggression in Korea, constantly bombing our northeastern compatriots, and is also preparing to follow the old path of the Japanese invaders' aggression against China, and has already burned the flames of aggression against China to the edge of the motherland. The people around Lugou Bridge, who have long suffered from the ravages of foreign imperialism, have therefore roared in anger. Zheng Yongquan, chairman of the Farmers' Association, said to the people of the whole town: "The Japanese invaders occupied China back then, first by invading Korea, then by forcibly occupying the Northeast, and then by directly sending troops to Fengtai, opening fire on the people of Lugou Bridge. More than ten years of painful and tearful life have made us deeply realize that imperialism is unwilling to let us live in peace. In order to protect our good life, we will never allow American imperialist aggression! We farmers in the rear must quickly hand in public grain, speed up autumn plowing, and work hard to increase production, and use practical work to assist the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers to resist American imperialist aggression. We must never let the American devils occupy Korea and then gradually invade China." The sixty-seven-year-old Jin Run, upon hearing the news that the American imperialists were妄想(trying in vain, vainly attempting) to attack China, asked the secretary of the Communist Youth League to write a letter to his son, Jin Wenyu, who was in the artillery battalion of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army. The letter said: "Our family was allocated seventeen mu of land during the land reform, and this year we harvested more than one thousand jin of grain, which is enough for a year. I am sixty-seven years old, and I have only just begun to live this good life with food and clothing. But I heard the chairman of the Farmers' Association say that the American devils are coming to invade our China again, and they want to come to Lugou Bridge to kill and set fires again, destroying our good life that has just begun. Don't forget the hardships our family suffered when the Japanese invaders occupied Lugou Bridge. Now the scars from being shot by the devils still often hurt. You must firmly remember your father's words: As long as the devils continue to invade China, you must continue to fight bravely on the front line, defend our country, and defend our good days!"
    Now, the people of the villages around Lugou Bridge have been actively taking action under the slogan of "Resist America, Aid Korea, and Defend Our Homes and Country." Thirty-one members of the Communist Youth League in Zhangguozhuang have sworn an oath at the current affairs discussion meeting. They said: "American imperialism continues to expand its aggression in Korea, and we cannot sit idly by. We must learn from the spirit of Jin Yuliang and Wang Yongshun in resisting American imperialism and Chiang's bandits, and fight the American devils!" Twenty-three members of the Communist Youth League in Wanping Town have also expressed the same intention to go and kill the enemy, while women are playing a leading role in handing in public grain. Ji Yinlan, the women's committee member of Zhangguozhuang, proposed to the women: "Women should play a leading role in handing in public grain. First, it should be fast, and second, it should be clean." They said: "Handing in public grain well will ensure that there is military grain at the front, so that we can resist American imperialist aggression." Zhangguozhuang and Wanping Town originally planned to complete the autumn tax collection in ten days, but they completed it in seven days.
    The people around Lugou Bridge, who have suffered all kinds of humiliation from the Japanese invaders, have now stood up under the leadership of the Communist Party, and they are determined to bravely participate in the patriotic movement to resist America, aid Korea, and defend their homes and country with practical actions.

    芦沟桥畔人民展开抗美援朝运动
    本报记者  鲁生
    芦沟桥，这座中国历史上有名的伟大建筑，曾在中国人民反抗帝国主义侵略、争取民族解放的斗争史上写下了光辉的一页。十三年前的七月七日，日本帝国主义在这里发动了对中国的全面侵略；全中国人民在中国共产党领导下，也从此展开了全面的抗战，奋战八年，直至胜利。十三年前驻守芦沟桥的中国爱国士兵，在全国人民抗日救国怒潮的推动下，曾对残暴凶恶的日本强盗的挑衅，举行了英勇的抗击；受尽日寇百般凌辱的芦沟桥畔的人民，曾纷纷为抗日军队运送子弹、粮食，有力地支援战争。可是，当爱国的士兵们把两千多日寇包围于丰台营房，正要予以歼灭的时候，卖国贼蒋介石命令他们“不准抵抗”，并断绝了他们的给养，使数百名热血爱国男儿，不得不忍痛含泪退下来。从此，光荣的芦沟桥被践踏在日寇的兽蹄下八年之久，芦沟桥畔的人民也就跌进了日寇黑暗统治的苦难深渊。
    解放以前，芦沟桥畔的人民，受尽了帝国主义和国民党反动派的重重压迫。日寇统治时期，宛平镇（位于芦沟桥畔）和张郭庄两村共有三千多人口，不堪压迫被迫逃亡一半以上，剩下逃不及的人民，每天都在日寇刺刀的威胁下，挣扎地过着痛苦的生活，给日寇修炮楼、挖战壕。日寇进行第六次“治安强化”时，人们只能以“混合面”和红薯皮充饥。宛平镇上一所大院里，关满了饥饿的人群，因为他们在街上要饭，违反日寇的“治安强化”。当时从那个院里，每天要用铁丝拖出十多个饿死的尸体；永定河两岸，经常可以看到枕藉的尸体和吃死人吃红了眼睛的野狗。宛平镇农会郑永泉回忆当时的悲惨情景说：“那时在芦沟桥畔没有中国人民的活路，只有日寇和野狗吃得很肥！”
    日寇投降后，芦沟桥畔的人民并没有得到真正的解放。卖国贼蒋介石篡夺了中国人民的胜利果实，企图把中国出卖给美帝国主义，于是芦沟桥畔的人民又重陷入蒋匪军和美帝国主义的罪恶统治之下，又被迫饿着肚子给匪军修炮楼，被抓去当炮灰，六十四岁的金润老汉一家人刚逃回村，吃没吃喝没喝，好容易向亲朋借到了十五万元伪法币，买了两条纸烟，在芦沟桥边摆着小摊卖。第二天便碰到一个坐吉普车的美国兵来买烟，因为语言不通错作了手势，被美国鬼子踢了两脚，把纸烟踢翻了一地。金润老汉想起这事来很痛心，他说：“美国鬼子打我时，旁边还站一个警察，可是那个家伙不但不制止美国鬼子这种暴行，还大骂了我一顿，说我是‘捣乱’，禁止我以后再到芦沟桥上卖烟。我当时想：中国人的芦沟桥，不准中国人卖烟，可准外国鬼子打人！很想和他争论，后来又想：他们都是美国鬼子一伙，争也不顶事，只得忍气吞声连忙拾起踢散的纸烟回到家里，到家气的吃不下饭，气得二儿子金文玉跑到派出所去问所长。谁知他一去就没回来，到第二天我才打听到他已被警察关起来了！”他指着镇当中的一所房院说：“那时抓的青年，都关在那所院里，光宛平镇和张郭庄就被抓走四十多个。”这时芦沟桥又和日寇统治时期一样，只见太阳牌换上了星条牌，桥上飞跑着美国汽车，桥两边尽是美国兵在作打水鸭子游戏，枪声拍拍地整天响着，俨若当年日寇朝着芦沟桥上打靶子。桥上被日寇轰毁的石狮子仍然是少头没脚，两岸被日寇轰毁的房屋仍然是颓垣断壁，人民的生活依然痛苦不堪。金润老汉的儿子金文玉被匪军抓走后，金润老汉更无法生活，只好靠讨饭度日，有时还被匪军抓去修炮楼。但是，芦沟桥的人民在这种残酷压迫下，向反动派展开了英勇的斗争。金文玉和张郭庄王永顺等四十多个青年小伙子，被关进宛平镇当年日寇残杀中国人的那个院子里。他们互相串通后，于一个夜晚杀死监视他们的伪警察，冲出了宛平镇，参加了人民解放军。从此芦沟桥畔的人民就在他们革命行动的影响下，和美国帝国主义分子及其走狗蒋匪军进一步展开了斗争。
    一九四八年，芦沟桥为中国人民解放军解放了，光荣的芦沟桥又重新属于人民。这时逃亡他乡的人们，才纷纷返回家乡。在共产党和人民政府领导下，实行了土地改革，进行生产互助，仅仅一年多时间，芦沟桥完全改变了面貌。现在到芦沟桥畔，再也看不到三年前那种愁眉苦脸的人，他们都高兴地唱着歌，愉快地进行着各种生产劳动。从前被日寇打毁的石狮子，现在都已补换了新的，石碑上“芦沟晓月”的字迹，从新涂饰了颜色，显得分外光辉。桥两边被日寇轰毁的村庄和房舍已经修补起来；宛平镇已由一年前的一千多人增加到两千人。由于实行了土地改革，贫苦农民都分得了土地，生活一天天好起来。金润老汉分到十七亩好地，去年打粮食除了一家吃用，还补修好三间房；今年打的粮食又足够一年吃，生活已经开始改善。他计划今冬节约些粮食，明春再买个耕牛。
    今年六月下旬，芦沟桥畔的劳动人民，正在紧张地进行生产时，突然听到美帝国主义进攻朝鲜并侵略我国台湾的消息，使他们愤怒起来。在七月七日——这是芦沟桥人民和全国人民难以忘记的一天，他们在芦沟桥畔举行了抗日纪念大会。在会上全镇百分之八十以上的人民，都在和平宣言上签了名。他们一致宣誓：“反对美帝国主义侵略，保卫世界和平。”现在他们知道美帝国主义还在扩大侵略朝鲜，不断轰炸我东北同胞，还准备走日寇侵略中国的老路，已经把侵略中国的火焰烧到祖国的边缘。长期经受外国帝国主义蹂躏的芦沟桥畔人民因而怒吼了。农会主任郑永泉向全镇人民说：“日寇当年占中国，第一步是侵占朝鲜，后来又强占东北，再后来就直接派兵驻到丰台，向咱芦沟桥人民头上开了火。十多年的痛苦血泪生活，使我们深刻认识了，帝国主义是不甘心让我们过安心日子的。我们为了保护我们的好生活，决不允许美帝国主义的侵略！我们农民在后方要赶快缴纳公粮，加紧秋耕地，还要努力进行生产，用实际工作来援助朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿部队，抵抗美帝国主义的侵略，绝不能让美国鬼子侵占了朝鲜，再一步步来侵占中国。”六十七岁的金润老汉听到美帝妄想进攻中国的消息，就托青年团支书给他在人民解放军某部炮兵营的儿子金文玉写了一封信，信中说：“咱家在土改时分到那十七亩地，今年又打了一千多斤粮食，足够一年吃。我六十七岁了，才开始过这有吃有穿的好生活。可是听到农会主任说：美国鬼子又来侵略咱中国，又想来咱芦沟桥杀人放火，破坏我们刚刚开始的好光景。你可别忘了，日寇侵占芦沟桥时咱家遭受的磨难。现在咱被鬼子枪打的伤疤还时常疼痛。你要牢牢记住父亲的话：只要鬼子继续侵略中国，你就要继续在前线英勇作战，保卫我们的国家，保卫我们的好日子！”
    现在芦沟桥畔各村的人们，已在“抗美援朝，保家卫国”的口号下积极行动起来，张郭庄三十一个青年团员已在时事讨论会上宣了誓，他们说：“美帝国主义继续扩大侵略朝鲜，我们不能坐看，我们要学习金玉良、王永顺反抗美帝及蒋匪的斗争精神，和美国鬼子拚！”宛平镇的二十三个青年团员也同样表示要去杀敌，妇女们则在缴公粮中起着带头作用。张郭庄妇女委员冀音兰向妇女们提出：“缴公粮中妇女要起带头作用，第一要快，第二要干净。”她们说：“缴好公粮，保证前方有军粮，好抵抗美帝国主义的侵略。”张郭庄和宛平镇原计划十天完成秋征，结果七天就完成了。
    受尽日寇百般凌辱的芦沟桥畔人民，现在在共产党领导下已经站起来了，他们坚决勇敢地要以实际行动参加抗美援朝、保家卫国的爱国运动。
