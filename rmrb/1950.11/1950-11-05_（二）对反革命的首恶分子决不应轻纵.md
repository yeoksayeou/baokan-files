(II) Under No Circumstances Should the Chief Culprits of Counter-Revolution Be Treated Leniently
    Today, this newspaper publishes the Supreme People's Court of the Central People's Government's correction of the error made by the Tongxian Special District Branch of the Hebei Provincial People's Court in leniently sentencing the important bandit Li Boren to fifteen years imprisonment, and the revised sentence of death for the said criminal. This judgment by the Supreme People's Court is of great significance for correcting the current tendency of "unlimited leniency" in various localities.

    The People's Government has consistently implemented a lenient policy, saving many errant elements and transforming them into new people through reform. However, some judicial personnel do not have a sufficient understanding of the correct relationship between leniency and suppression, and do not understand that leniency must be combined with suppression in order to completely disintegrate the enemy and eliminate the enemy. They do not understand that one-sided leniency will allow those heinous counter-revolutionary elements to act recklessly, and will, in effect, condone their continued evildoing. A farmer in Sanyuan, Shaanxi, said: "The government is so lenient that it will make the bandits even more rampant. One robbery can provide for the whole year's living, which is cheaper than working!" Especially those counter-revolutionary elements like Li Boren who have relied on the Japanese puppets and Chiang Kai-shek bandits for a long time and committed many evils, if they are not severely punished, not only will many victims remain unavenged, but it will also make the bandits and special agents think that there is an opportunity to take advantage of, which will make the broad masses of people suffer even more. It should be known that being merciful to the enemy is being cruel to the people.

    For chief culprits like Li Boren, the lenient attitude of the Tongxian Branch Court should never be adopted. Li Boren is a butcher who has committed many evils. If one were to listen to his flowery words and deal with him on the basis of so-called "occupational crimes," that would be extremely muddled. We cannot agree with the so-called "occupational crimes" argument. For a criminal like Li Boren who has been engaged in counter-revolutionary activities for a long time, his occupation is only a tool for his evildoing, and only his heinousness can obtain and maintain his occupation. Therefore, the Tongxian Branch Court's reduction of sentence based on "occupational crimes" is completely wrong, and the Supreme People's Court's revised judgment should become one of the model precedents for suppressing counter-revolutionary elements in various localities.

    People's Courts in various localities should appropriately give those counter-revolutionary criminals the punishment they deserve, and resolutely oppose all erroneous ideas and practices of leniently treating counter-revolutionary elements.

### （二）对反革命的首恶分子决不应轻纵

　　（二）对反革命的首恶分子决不应轻纵
    今天本报公布中央人民政府最高人民法院纠正河北省人民法院通县专区分院轻判重要匪徒李伯仁十五年徒刑的错误，改判该犯以死刑。最高人民法院这一判决，对于目前各地纠正“宽大无边”的倾向具有重要意义。
    人民政府一贯执行了宽大政策，挽救了许多失足的分子经过改造成为新人。但是有些司法人员由于对宽大与镇压的正确关系认识不够，不了解宽大必须与镇压相结合才能彻底瓦解敌人，消灭敌人。不了解片面的宽大就会使那些穷凶极恶的反革命分子肆无忌惮，就会无形中纵容他们更继续作恶。陕西三原有个农民说：“政府这样宽大，将使土匪更加猖獗。抢一次可供全年生活，倒比做工便宜！”尤其是那些曾投靠日伪及蒋匪长期作恶的像李伯仁这样的反革命分子，如不给以严厉惩办，不但使许多受害群众含冤莫白，而且更会使土匪特务认为有隙可乘，将使广大的人民更受其害。应该知道对敌人的仁慈，就是对人民的残忍。
    对于像李伯仁这样首恶分子，是决不应该采取通县分院那样的轻纵态度的。李伯仁是作恶多端的屠夫，如果竟听其花言巧语，而以所谓“职务犯罪”来处理，那就是极大的糊涂。我们不能同意所谓“职务犯罪”的说法，像李伯仁这样长期从事反革命活动的罪犯，他的职业只不过是他作恶的工具，而且只有他的穷凶极恶才能获得与保持他的职业，所以通县分院以“职务犯罪”而予以减刑判决是完全错误的，最高人民法院的改判应成为各地镇压反革命分子的模范判例之一。
    各地人民法院应该恰如其份地给予那些反革命罪犯以应得的处分，坚决反对轻纵反革命分子的一切错误观念与错误做法。
