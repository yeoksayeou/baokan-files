　　【This Newspaper's Dispatch】In this new patriotic movement to Resist America, Aid Korea, and Defend the Home and Country, professors and teaching assistants in the Sand灘 area of Peking University are dedicating their efforts in various effective ways, striving to fulfill the sacred task of Resist America, Aid Korea, and Defend the Home and Country. Many professors participate in the practical work of the leading organization of this movement, the "Peking University Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Against American Aggression." Professors Tang Yongtong, Xu Deheng, Zeng Zhaolun, and Ji Xianlin serve on the Presidium, Professor Deng Guangming serves as Secretary-General, Professor Ma Xingyuan serves as Liaison Minister, Professor Jin Kemu serves as Study Minister, Professor Feng Chengzhi serves as Propaganda Minister, and Professor Wang Hongzhen serves as Security Minister. Nearly one hundred percent of professors and teaching assistants participate in current affairs studies; the vast majority have signed up to participate in various propaganda-related tasks. Several departments have fully mobilized, combining their professional work, individually or collectively engaging in the compilation of books and periodicals related to Resist America, Aid Korea, including in-depth theoretical works, and even more popular reading materials.

　　Professors Returning from Overseas Study Denounce American Imperialist Atrocities

　　The study and discussion of current affairs has created a surge of enthusiasm in the trade union groups of various departments and institutes. Study sessions are held daily in the Departments of Philosophy, Chinese, Mathematics, Chemistry, Geology, Zoology, Botany, and the Institute of Arts, while other departments hold them every other day or regularly. The group leaders have shown great enthusiasm in their work. For example, the Western Languages ​​Department has thirty-eight people, scattered throughout the city, and Mr. Zhao Longxiang, the group leader, often spends an entire morning or afternoon running around for a single notice. In discussions and casual conversations, many professors who have returned from studying abroad have bitterly criticized the racial discrimination prevalent in imperialist countries, especially the United States, where Chinese students suffered greatly and were subjected to all kinds of humiliation; they recounted the rotten, decadent, and ugly social life in the United States, as well as how American "young master" soldiers even lay down on carpets when fighting. Through these vivid accounts, the emotions of hatred, contempt, and disdain for American imperialism have been aroused among many professors and teaching assistants.

　　More Social Experience  Difficult Problems Can Be Explained

　　There are two ways to participate in direct propaganda work: one is to accept invitations to give lectures in middle schools or groups, and the other is to go out to promote with students. Those who are invited to give lectures have received great results. The professors and teaching assistants of the Departments of Physics and Chemistry have formed an atomic bomb lecture group of ten people and have given lectures in various middle schools many times, solving many problems for the middle school students. Professor Zhu Guangya has given the most lectures and received positive feedback. The teachers who participated in propaganda work with the students have shown a high degree of enthusiasm. Facts have also proved that whether it is a discussion in middle schools or propaganda on the streets, the teachers' conversations have played a significant role. Because educators have experienced a lot of oppression in the old society, and because their social experience is richer than that of the students, teachers can explain some problems that students cannot solve very well more profoundly. For example, once when the Department of Chemistry held a forum at the Beining Midwifery School, the mood of the masses was not high. Professor Tang Aoqing stood up and said excitedly: "Today, I am the only one wearing a suit. When I think of the insults I suffered in the United States, I even hate this suit. I dare say that if I wear it out, I will never wear it again." This made the masses pay attention. Mr. Tang then described the various forms of racial discrimination in the United States, and the atmosphere at the meeting became enthusiastic. Mr. Tang had just returned from the United States and knew a lot about the recent social life in the United States. He and Professor Zhang Longxiang from the same department lectured on the situation in the United States in various middle schools and were very popular. The professors and teaching assistants of the Departments of Mathematics and Geology participated in propaganda with the students in particularly large numbers, and the Department of Geology decided to take advantage of the opportunity of field practice to go deep into the countryside to promote. People have been sent to Changping to understand the situation.

　　Various Departments Formulate Work Plans  Compile Books and Periodicals to Resist America, Aid Korea

　　The trade union groups of the Departments of Science, Arts, and Law have all discussed how they can make greater contributions to the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, and several departments have held several discussions for this purpose. The current situation is that each department has formulated plans to write articles, compile books and periodicals, and research specific work that directly serves the Resist America, Aid Korea. The majority of professors and teaching assistants have spontaneously and voluntarily mobilized, and most departments are participating fully, undertaking and already collecting materials separately.

　　Science Faculty

　　In the Faculty of Science, the Department of Physics had already helped students study the atomic bomb issue when the movement began. Since the ninth of this month, all professors and teaching assistants have joined the atomic bomb data group and lecture group, collecting materials and carrying out propaganda all day long. Professor Zhu Guangya has written an article entitled "Atomic Energy and Atomic Weapons," which was mimeographed and distributed by the trade union group as an important reference material for students going out to promote. In recent days, all professors and teaching assistants have continued to study, preparing to write several popular booklets. Professor Rao Yutai has been ill for a long time, but he still strives to write a short article, suggesting that scientific workers unconditionally contribute their expertise when necessary. Three professors and teaching assistants from the Department of Chemistry participated in the atomic bomb lecture group of the Department of Physics. Three professors have written short articles, and Professors Xing Qiyi and Zhang Longxiang are planning to study the methods of making dry rations and blood banks. This work will continue for a long time. The Department of Geology decided to concentrate all its efforts on studying the comparison of resources between the democratic camp and the aggressive camp. After this work is completed, everyone will be able to better understand the bright future of the development of the countries in the democratic camp. Because everyone in the Department of Zoology is good at drawing, in addition to drawing cartoons to cooperate with the current propaganda work, they have also decided to compile comic strips, which will be led by Professor Li Ruqi and published continuously for a long time. Mr. Li has designed pictures targeting the idea of ​​"whoever comes is the same" among some citizens. This is unique and particularly creative in the propaganda work of Peking University, and it is expected to achieve something. Most of the professors and teaching assistants in the Department of Botany have participated in the work of collecting biological warfare materials, led by Professor Zhang Jingyue. This work is being done in cooperation with the Department of Zoology. Professors Li Ruqi, Chen Deming, Chen Yuezeng, and Zhang Zongbing of the Department of Zoology are also busy collecting materials.

　　Faculty of Arts

　　In the Faculty of Arts, the Department of Philosophy decided to write two books, one is "Critique of American Philosophy," and the other is "Looking at the Traditional Friendship between China and Korea from the Spread of Buddhism," which is done to gain a deeper understanding of enemies and friends. The Department of History has now fully mobilized, including two Korean friends from the Department of Oriental Languages, under the leadership of Professor Jin Yufu of the Institute of Arts, as well as a teaching assistant from the Institute of Arts and a group of three professors and one teaching assistant from the Department of History. They are writing "A Brief History of Sino-Korean Friendship Relations." Under the leadership of Professor Zheng Tianting, the original teaching and research group on modern Chinese history is collecting materials on "A History of American Aggression Against China." Both are prepared to be written into booklets in extremely popular language in the short term. Professor Yang Renpian and Mr. Hu Zhongda are translating the article "The Truth about Korea" from the American magazine *Masses and Mainstream*, which is now mostly completed. Professor Zhu Qingyong has begun to translate the article "The Theoretical System of American Militarism" by Soviet international affairs expert Rubanov, and Professor Qi Youlie is collecting historical materials related to the Volunteer Army. When the movement began, the professors and teaching assistants of the Chinese Department cooperated with the students to create a cultural and artistic wall newspaper, and now they are preparing to collectively create some street plays and other literature and art that are most loved by the working people. Professor Zhu Guangqian of the Department of Western Languages ​​has made many efforts in promoting the work of the entire department, and took the lead in writing a poem to criticize the reactionary behavior of American imperialism at home and abroad. Professors Pan Jiaxun and Miao Langshan are also preparing to create street plays. Professor Ma Jian of the Department of Oriental Languages ​​is working with two Korean teachers, Ma Chaoqun and Li Qilie, to compile a Korean manual. In order to introduce the history of the Korean people's struggle to the Chinese people, the history of the Korean national liberation struggle translated by Mr. Ma Chaoqun and Mr. Li Qilie has now been published in draft form. In order to introduce the situation of the Chinese people's Resist America, Aid Korea movement to the people of other countries, Mr. Wang Shiqing and Mr. Liu Linrui are preparing to translate the important documents of this movement into Arabic. In order to introduce it to the minority brothers and sisters in the country, Mr. Li Sen is preparing to translate the same documents into Uyghur. The professors of the Library Specialization Department and the Museum Specialization Department are now busy participating in the preparation of a large-scale exhibition of Resist America, Aid Korea.

　　Faculty of Law

　　In the Faculty of Law, the professors and teaching assistants of the Department of Law are studying the evils of American imperialism in the legal aspects. Professor Rui Mu plans to write articles on issues such as American imperialism's discrimination against overseas Chinese and American labor laws. Professor Huang Juefei prepares to write *American Lynching*, and Professor Wang Xuan prepares to write *American Immigration Law*. *American Lynching*, which Professor Huang Juefei is studying, has been reported within the department. The professors and teaching assistants of the Department of Political Science have decided to compile several booklets. They are divided into two categories: one is *The United Nations and the Korean War*, which is compiled under the leadership of Professor Lou Bangyan. The other is *Small Series of Imperialist Camps*, etc., which is compiled under the leadership of Professor Gong Xiangrui. The *Small Series of Imperialist Camps* covers a wide range, and those that have been started include: (1) Britain, France, Italy; (2) Latin America under American imperialism; (3) American reactionary organizations; (4) British Communist Party. In order to study the issues in depth, the professors and teaching assistants of the Department of Economics have decided to hold a current affairs study meeting every two weeks. Each time, one person is appointed to report on the current issues, followed by a discussion. The results of the discussion are sorted out by one person and then published. The topic of the first discussion is "Understanding the Issue of Resist America, Aid Korea from an Economic Perspective," and Professor Zhou Binglin will give the report.

　　北大教授讲助投入抗美爱国热潮
    学习时事，举行讨论座谈，参加讲演宣传，并编写书刊。
    【本报讯】在这次抗美援朝保家卫国的新爱国主义运动中，北京大学沙滩区的教授讲助们，正以各种有效方式献出自己的力量，为完成抗美援朝保家卫国的神圣任务而奋斗。在这一运动的领导机构“中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略北京大学支会”中，许多教授参加了实际工作。汤用彤、许德珩、曾昭抡、季羡林四教授担任了主席团的工作，邓广铭教授任秘书长，马杏垣教授任联络部长，金克木教授任学习部长，冯承植教授任宣传部长，王鸿祯教授任安全部长。教授讲助参加时事学习的接近百分之百；签名参加各种与宣传有关的工作的占绝大多数。若干系全体动员起来，结合着自己的业务，个别地或集体地从事于有关抗美援朝书刊的编写，其中也有深入的理论性的著作，而通俗读物更居多数。
    留学归来教授痛斥美帝暴行
    时事学习和讨论，在各系科所工会小组中形成热潮。哲学系、中文系、数学系、化学系、地质系、动物系、植物系、文科研究所等小组每天都有学习会，其他的各系科也都间日或定期举行。小组长们在工作中表现了高度的热情，例如西语系全系有三十八人，散居全市各处，小组长赵隆勷先生就往往为了一个通知而跑一个整整的上午或下午。讨论中，漫谈中，许多留学归来的教授，痛陈帝国主义国家特别是美国的种族歧视，中国的留学生吃尽了苦头，受尽了侮辱；历述美国国内腐烂的、堕落的、丑恶的社会生活，以及美国“少爷”兵在作战时，卧倒还要铺上毯子。通过这些生动事实的叙述，许多教授讲助们仇视、鄙视、蔑视美帝的情绪都激发起来了。
    社会经验比较丰富  困难问题能够解说
    参加直接宣传工作的有两种方式：一是应邀到中学或团体去讲演，一是和同学一道出去宣传。应邀讲演者收到了很大的效果。物理系和化学系的教授讲助们十个人组成了原子弹讲演组，已去各中学讲演多次，给中学同学们解决了许多问题。朱光亚教授讲演的次数最多，反映良好。和同学一道宣传的先生们，都表现了高度的积极性。事实又证明，无论是到中学座谈，或是在街头宣传，先生们的谈话，都起了极大的作用。由于教育工作者在旧社会里受压迫的生活体验很多，由于他们的社会经验比较同学们要丰富，有些同学们不能很好解决的问题，先生们却能更深刻地给以解说。例如，有一次化学系在北宁助产学校举行座谈会时，群众情绪不高，唐敖庆教授就起立发言，他激动地说：“今天在场的只有我一人穿西装，想起我在美国所受的气，我连这套衣服也恨，我敢说把它穿破了我就不再做。”这就使群众注意起来。唐先生接着叙述了美国种族歧视的种种情形，会场上的情绪就昂扬起来了。唐先生是新从美国回来的，对于美国最近的社会生活知道得很多，他和同系的张龙翔教授在各中学里讲演美国情形，大受欢迎。数学系和地质系的教授讲助们参加同学一道宣传的特别多，地质系并决定在最近利用野外实习的机会，深入到农村去宣传。现在已派人到昌平一带去了解情况。
    各系科订工作计划  编写抗美援朝书刊
    理、文、法各系科的工会小组都已研讨了如何能在抗美援朝运动中作更大贡献的问题，若干系科并为此曾举行了好几次的讨论会。目前的情形是：各系科都已拟制了写文章、编书刊、研究直接服务于抗美援朝的具体工作的计划。大多数的教授讲助已经自发自愿地动员起来，多数系是全体参加，分别担任并已在进行搜集材料。
    理学院
    在理学院，物理系当这一运动开始时，就已经帮助同学研究原子弹问题。从本月九日起，全系教授讲助都已分别参加了原子弹资料组和讲演组，整日地在搜集材料，出动宣传。朱光亚教授已经写成了《原子能与原子武器》一文，由工会小组油印发出，作为同学外出宣传的重要参考资料。日来全体教授讲助仍在继续钻研，准备写出几本通俗化的小册子。饶毓泰教授卧病已久，但仍奋力写出短文一篇，建议科学工作者在必要时，无条件的贡献出自己的专长。化学系的三位教授和讲助参加了物理系的原子弹讲演组，有三位教授已经写了短文，邢其毅和张龙翔二位教授正在计划着研究干粮制法和血库问题。这种工作将长期地继续进行下去。地质系决定集中全体力量研究民主阵营与侵略阵营资源的对比，这一工作完成后，将使大家更能了解民主阵营国家发展的光明前途。动物系因大家都擅长绘图，因此，除已经配合目前宣传工作、绘制漫画以外，并决定编制连环图画，由李汝祺教授负责领导，长期陆续出版，现李先生已针对部分市民中“谁来都是一样”的思想情况在设计画面。这在北大宣传工作中是别开生面而特别富有创造性的，预料必能有所收获。植物系的大多数的教授讲助都参加了搜集生物战资料的工作，由张景钺教授领导。这一工作是和动物系合作来做的。动物系的李汝祺、陈德明、陈阅增、张宗炳四教授也正忙于搜集材料。
    文学院
    在文学院，哲学系决定编写两本书，一本是《美国哲学批判》，一本是《从佛教的传布看中朝友谊的传统》，这是为了更深刻地了解敌友而做的。史学系现已全部动员起来，在文科研究所金毓黻教授的领导下包括东语系两位朝鲜友人等，以及文科研究所一位讲助和史学系三位教授一位讲助的小组正在编写《中朝友谊关系小史》。在郑天挺教授的领导下，原有的中国近代史教研小组正在搜集“美国侵华史”的材料。这二者都准备在短期内以极通俗的文字写成小册子。杨人楩教授和胡钟达先生在翻译美国《群众与主流》杂志中《朝鲜真相》一文，现已完成大半。朱庆永教授已着手翻译苏联国际问题专家鲁巴诺夫《美国军国主义之理论体系》一文，戚佑烈教授正在搜集历史上有关志愿军的史料。中文系的教授讲助们当运动开始时，即已和同学合作创办文工壁报，现在正准备集体创作一些街头剧和其他最为劳动人民所爱好的文艺。西语系的朱光潜教授在推动全系工作中，曾作了许多努力，并率先写了一首诗斥责美帝国主义在国内外的反动行为。潘家洵教授、缪朗山教授等也正在准备创作街头剧。东语系的马坚教授等正和两位朝鲜籍教师——马超群、李启烈先生等合作编写朝鲜手册。为了把朝鲜人民斗争的历史介绍给中国人民，马超群、李启烈二先生所翻译的朝鲜民族解放斗争史现在已出初稿。为了把中国人民抗美援朝运动的情况介绍给其他国家的人民，王世清和刘麟瑞二先生准备把这一运动中的重要文件译成阿拉伯文。为了把它介绍给国内少数兄弟民族，李森先生准备把同样文件译成维吾尔文。图书馆专修科和博物馆专修科的教授们现在正忙于参加筹办大规模的抗美援朝展览。
    法学院
    在法学院，法律系的教授讲助们在研究美帝有关的法律方面的罪恶。芮沐教授拟写关于美帝歧视华侨及美国劳工法案等问题的文字，黄觉非教授准备写《美国私刑》，汪瑄教授准备写《美国移民律》。黄觉非教授所研究的《美国私刑》并已在系内作过报告。政治系的教授讲助们已决定编写若干小册子。其中分二类：一类是《联合国与朝鲜战争》，由楼邦彦教授领导编写。一类是《帝国主义阵营小丛刊》等等。由龚祥瑞教授领导编写。《帝国主义阵营小丛刊》包括范围很广，现已着手编写的有：（一）英国、法国、意国；（二）美帝统治下的拉丁美洲；（三）美国的反动组织；（四）英国共产党。经济系的教授讲助们为了深入钻研问题，决定每两周举行一次时事问题学习会，就目前发生的问题中，每次推定一人作报告，继之以讨论，讨论的结果，由一人加以整理，然后发表。第一次讨论的题目为《从经济上认识抗美援朝问题》，将由周炳琳教授作报告。
