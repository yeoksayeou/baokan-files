　　Students from Various Countries Fight to Defend Peace
    Grossman Writes Article Commemorating International Students' Day
    [Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 19th] According to TASS, Moscow: Grossman, President of the International Union of Students, wrote an article in Komsomolskaya Pravda on the 17th to commemorate International Students' Day, stating that since the Second World Student Congress held in August, democratic students from various countries have been fighting to implement the resolutions of the Congress. Thirty-two local student groups in the United Kingdom have established a National Student Peace Committee to lead British students in the struggle to defend peace. They have won the struggle with the leaders of the National Union of Students of England and Wales, who are trying to lead British students onto the path of supporting the policies of warmongers. Italian students concluded "Student Month for the Struggle to Defend Peace" on the 17th, and this movement was extremely successful. French youth, under the slogan of "Down with War," are fighting to defend peace and oppose the extension of military service. Fifty percent of students in Paris have signed the peace declaration. American students, despite persecution, held International Student Week in many universities. In Latin American countries, the student movement has achieved further achievements. In the past two months, Brazilian youth have collected 70,000 signatures on the peace declaration. In Japan, progressive students are subjected to brutal oppression, but the struggle is still unfolding.
    Grossman said: This year's International Students' Day coincides with the Second World Peace Congress held in Warsaw. Member organizations of the International Union of Students actively participated in the preparations for the Congress, and students collected millions of signatures for the peace declaration among the people of various countries. International democratic students will guarantee the implementation of the historic resolutions of the Second Congress and thwart the sinister plots of the warmongers.

　　各国学生为保卫和平而斗争
    格罗曼撰文纪念国际学生日
    【新华社十九日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：国际学生联合会主席格罗曼在十七日的共青真理报上撰文纪念国际学生日称：自八月间举行了世界学生第二届代表大会以来，各国民主学生一直为实现大会的决议而斗争。英国的三十二个地方性学生团体，已成立了全国学生和平委员会，领导英国学生进行保卫和平的斗争。他们和英格兰与威尔士全国学生联合会的领袖们进行的斗争已得到了胜利，后者正企图把英国学生引上支持战争贩子政策的道路。意大利的学生们在十七日结束了“学生为保卫和平斗争月”，这一运动进行得极为成功。法国青年在“打倒战争”的口号下，为保卫和平和反对延长兵役年限而进行斗争，巴黎百分之五十的学生已在和平宣言上签了名。美国学生不顾迫害，在许多大学中举行了国际学生周。在拉丁美洲各国中，学生运动已获得进一步的成就，在过去两个月中，巴西青年已征集到七万人在和平宣言上签名。在日本，进步学生虽受到残酷高压，斗争依然在展开着。
    格罗曼称：今年的国际学生日适逢第二届世界保卫和平大会在华沙举行。国际学生联合会的各会员团体曾积极地参加了和大的筹备工作，学生们在各国的人民中间为和平宣言征集到了千百万个签名。国际民主学生将保证贯彻二届和大的历史性的决议，击破战争贩子们的罪恶阴谋。
