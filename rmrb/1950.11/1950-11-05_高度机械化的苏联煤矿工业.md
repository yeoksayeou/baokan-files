　　Highly Mechanized Soviet Coal Mining Industry
    The Soviet Union has an exceptionally rich reserve of coal mines. More than 1,800 coal-producing areas have been discovered from Central Asia to Sakhalin, from Pechora beyond the Arctic Circle to Transcaucasia. The Soviet coal mining industry has developed extremely rapidly since the October Revolution. In 1912, before the revolution, the total coal output was only 29 million tons, but it surged to 166 million tons in 1940, an increase of nearly six times. In 1937, the Soviet Union ranked fourth in the world in coal production, and now it occupies the first place in Europe.

    The Soviet Union also ranks first in the world in the mechanization of coal mining. In 1913, only 1.7 percent of coal mining work used machinery, while in 1937, the degree of mechanization had reached 90 percent. At this time, the degree of mechanization in the United States was 85 percent and in the United Kingdom it was 63 percent. During the implementation of the post-war Five-Year Plan, the mechanization of coal mining was greatly improved. In 1949, the degree of mechanization of coal excavation had increased from 92.5 percent before the war to 99 percent. The mechanization of coal transportation in tunnels increased from 59.6 percent before the war to 84 percent, and coal loading increased from 91 percent before the war to 96 percent. By the end of 1949, the mechanization of the main processes of coal mine work was as follows: coal cutting 99 percent, transportation 99.5 percent, hauling 93 percent, and coal loading 99.5 percent. Many coal pits in the Donets Basin have become veritable underground factories. In 1948, the labor productivity of coal mining in the United Kingdom fell below the level of sixty years ago.

    During the Soviet Patriotic War, the coal mining industry played a huge role, ensuring a sufficient supply of fuel for the wartime economy. At that time, due to the temporary fall of the two main coal-producing areas, the Moscow Basin and the Donets Basin, the supply of various fuels in 1942 (calculated by converting various fuels into standard fuel) was more than halved compared with 1940. However, after passing through the low point of producing 92 million tons that year, fuel production increased to 114 million tons in 1943 and 139 million tons in 1944, mainly as a result of increased coal production.

    The post-war Five-Year Plan stipulated that the total coal output should reach 250 million tons in 1950, exceeding the pre-war level by 51 percent. The number of new coal mines and new enterprises should be more than doubled compared with the average from 1930 to 1940. During the implementation of the Five-Year Plan, coal production in 1946 increased by 10 percent compared with 1945, 1947 increased by 12 percent compared with 1946, 1948 increased by 14 percent compared with 1947, and 1949 increased by 13 percent compared with 1948. In the fourth quarter of 1949, the coal production level of 1950 stipulated in the Five-Year Plan had been exceeded. In 1948 and 1949, the number of mines increased elevenfold, and the number of coal transporters increased tenfold. In the United States, coal mining in 1949 decreased by 22 percent compared with 1947.

    The production area of Soviet coal has also greatly expanded. Now every large industrial area in the Soviet Union has its own coal mine, and new coal fields have been built in the Far East, Kazakhstan, Bashkir, Kyrgyzstan and other places. (Xinhua News Agency)

### 高度机械化的苏联煤矿工业

　　高度机械化的苏联煤矿工业
    苏联煤矿的储藏量异常丰富，从中亚细亚到库页岛，从北极圈外的彼楚拉到外高加索，已发现了一千八百个以上的产煤区。苏联煤矿工业在十月革命后发展得极快。在革命前的一九一二年，煤的总产量不过二千九百万吨，到一九四○年激增至一亿六千六百万吨，增加了将近六倍。一九三七年，苏联的煤产量居世界第四位，现在已占欧洲的第一位。
    苏联采煤工业的机械化则居世界第一位。在一九一三年，采煤工作仅有百分之一点七使用机械，而在一九三七年，机械化的程度已达到百分之九十。这时美国的机械化程度是百分之八十五、英国是百分之六十三。在战后五年计划执行过程中，采煤的机械化又大大提高，一九四九年，掘煤的机械化程度，已由战前的百分之九十二点五提高到百分之九十九。坑道运煤，从战前的百分之五十九点六，提高到百分之八十四，煤炭装车，从战前的百分之九十一提高到百分之九十六。到一九四九年底，煤矿工作的主要过程机械化的情形如下：切煤百分之九十九，运输百分之九十九点五，拖曳百分之九十三，煤斤装车百分之九十九点五。顿尼兹的许多煤坑，已成为名符其实的地下工厂。而在一九四八年，英国采煤的劳动生产率却降低到六十年前的水平之下。
    在苏联卫国战争时期，采煤工业曾发挥巨大潜力，为战时经济保证了充分的燃料供应。当时由于莫斯科盆地和顿尼兹两主要产煤区的暂时陷落，一九四二年各种燃料供给额（将各种燃料化成标准燃料计算）比一九四○年减少了一倍多。但在度过了这一年生产九千二百万吨的最低点后，一九四三年燃料产量提高到一亿一千四百万吨，四四年又提高到一亿三千九百万吨，这主要是煤产量增加的结果。
    战后五年计划规定一九五○年煤的总产量要达到二亿五千万吨，超过战前水平的百分之五十一。新的煤矿新企业，与一九三○年至四○年平均数相较，要增加到二倍以上。在执行五年计划时，一九四六年煤产量比一九四五年增加了百分之十，四七年较四六年增加百分之十二，四八年较四七年增加百分之十四，四九年较四八年增加百分之十三。四九年的第四季，已超过五年计划规定的一九五○年的产煤水平。一九四八与四九两年，矿坑的数目增加了十一倍，运煤机增加了十倍。而美国在一九四九年煤矿开采量与四七年相较，却降低了百分之二十二。
    苏联煤炭的产地也已大大扩张。现在苏联每一个巨大的工业区都已有自己的煤矿，在远东、哈萨克、巴什基尔、吉尔吉斯等地，都已建筑了新的煤场。（新华社）
