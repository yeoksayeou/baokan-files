[Beijing News Agency Dispatch] The Beijing Military Control Commission's Military Law Office issued a proclamation on the 21st regarding the execution of counter-revolutionaries Ma Defu and four others. The full text is as follows:

Counter-revolutionary Ma Defu betrayed the country and surrendered to the enemy during the War of Resistance Against Japan, serving as a squad leader for the Japanese collaborators in Fangshan County. After the Japanese surrender, he successively served as a company commander, battalion commander of the Fangshan pseudo-Self-Defense Corps, and regimental commander of the pseudo-Hebei Security 8th Regiment. During his ten years in the puppet regime, he repeatedly led troops in the Fangshan, Zhuozhou, and Liulihe areas, killing eight of our revolutionary cadres and wounding more than ten. After being captured by us, he refused to reform and colluded to escape.

For more than ten years, You Maozhi acted as a traitor and a lackey of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, leading troops in the Fangshan area to pick out, kill, and bury our county, district, and village cadres and people, with 56 confirmed cases.

Liu Zhenya, a military intelligence agent, has consistently committed evil deeds. After liberation, he made a false registration and continued to engage in counter-revolutionary activities, fleeing to the Northwest and obtaining a special agent organization number before returning to Beijing to organize bandits and special agents.

Guo Dianyu not only contacted the bandit Chang Zhonghua in early 1949 but also harbored special agent ringleaders and was responsible for keeping and selling a huge amount of gold for them.

Sun Jinchen contacted bandit leaders such as Chang Zhonghua, Ma Defu, and Guo Dianyu in March 1949, served as the manager of Fuji Tobacco Shop, harbored special agents, and sold gold.

The three bandits Ma Defu, You Maozhi, and Liu Zhenya, starting in February of this year, successively accepted the assignment from the Kuomintang secret agent ringleader Li Kunsheng (head of the KMT Internal Affairs Bureau's North China Party, Government, and Military Work Committee) commanded by the bandit Chang Zhonghua (at large), who was the commander of the so-called "Hebei Western People's Anti-Communist Self-Defense Army." You Maozhi was the deputy commander and commander of the First Column of the bandit army, Ma Defu was the commander of the Second Column, Guo Dianyu accepted 13 gold bars from the bandit Chang Zhonghua as funds for special agent activities, and opened the Fuji Tobacco Shop in Langfang Toutiao in this city as a cover for the special agent stronghold. Sun Jinchen served as the manager of the Fuji Tobacco Shop, concealing bandit leaders, selling gold, and taking practical responsibility for economic planning. From May of this year until the start of the Korean War, the bandits Ma Defu and You Maozhi believed that "the Third World War is about to break out," and they actively carried out activities, changed their numbers, and expanded the organization of the so-called "Hebei Provincial People's Self-Defense Army." They engraved fake seals, and the name seals of the three bandits Chang Zhonghua, Ma Defu, and You Maozhi, and issued fake orders. Chang Zhonghua was the commander of the bandit army, and You Maozhi and Ma Defu were the deputy commanders. Liu Zhenya was the commander of the Third Column (the first commander). The aforementioned five bandits held meetings multiple times at the Fuji Tobacco Shop, Zhongshan Park, and Beihai Park to plan and arrange counter-revolutionary activities. At the same time, they actively sought out old social connections in Zhuozhou, Fangshan, Laishui, and the Beijing-Tianjin areas, recruited bandits, developed reactionary organizations, conspired to seize our militia firearms, rob our state-owned stores, banks, and supply and marketing cooperatives, establish long-term bandit nests, prepare to collect grain after autumn, launch guerrilla warfare, and actively carry out anti-Soviet and anti-Communist and slanderous propaganda against the people's government, attempting to cooperate with Chiang Kai-shek's counterattack on the mainland after the Third World War. At the same time, they carried out the following series of counter-revolutionary crimes:

	I. On July 10th of this year, the bandit Ma Defu directed two bandits to murder our public security team member Comrade Zhang Guoyin near Caozhang in Fangshan, and plunder a submachine gun, 30 bullets, a pen, and a watch. On the 15th of the same month, the bandit Ma Defu directed bandits to rob our Beijing Municipal Pipeline Bureau Cement Plant of more than 19 million yuan in RMB, raincoats, flour, and other property in Zhoukoudian, Fangshan.

	II. In July, the three bandits Guo Dianyu, Sun Jinchen, and Ma Defu transported a Browning pistol and a purchased Canadian pistol to Zhuozhou at the Fuji Tobacco Shop. On the 23rd of the same month, Ma Defu planned to lead bandits to rob the Tuoli Tax Office and attack Fangshan County, but failed.

	III. On August 2nd, the bandit Ma Defu led two bandits, taking advantage of a stormy night, to attack Liu Kuan, the militia company commander of Shiliu Village in Fangshan County, and opened fire, while also wounding villager Liu Gui with a hand grenade. On the same night, they ambushed our autumn-protecting militia between Guanxianying and Lanying Village in Zhuozhou County, intending to seize firearms but failing.

	IV. On the night of August 9th, the bandit Ma Defu led three bandits to seize three rifles and 104 bullets from our village cadres in Nanhe Village, Fangshan, and fired shots to create disturbances.

	V. In August, the bandit Ma Defu led 11 bandits to occupy Lanying Village in Zhuozhou County, coercing the masses who were paying public grain to the people's government with weapons, seizing more than 7,000 jin of public grain. Furthermore, on August 29th, when our public security forces were encircling and suppressing them, the bandit Ma Defu led his troops to resist arrest with gunfire and broke through the encirclement alone.

	VI. On September 23rd, the bandit Ma Defu convened bandits to a meeting in Zhongshan Park. In addition to distributing fake appointment orders, they planned to attack the Doudian Railway Station to seize the weapons of our public security personnel, but failed.

The above has been thoroughly investigated and verified by the Public Security Bureau and this office through interrogation, investigation, on-site inspection, and accusations from representatives of the masses in the affected areas. The evidence is conclusive and the trial is factual.

It is determined that the bandits and special agents Ma Defu, You Maozhi, Liu Zhenya, Guo Dianyu, and Sun Jinchen organized armed bandits and special agents for counter-revolutionary purposes, actively carried out reactionary propaganda, spread rumors to confuse the public, attacked our people's armed forces, plundered our villages and towns, and conspired to armed rebellion, attempting to subvert the people's regime, which is extremely heinous. In order to protect the people's lives and property and consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship, this office will resolutely suppress these unrepentant counter-revolutionary key figures in accordance with the provisions of Article 7 of the Common Program and the instructions of the Supreme People's Court of the Central People's Government on suppressing counter-revolutionary activities. On November 21, 1950, the identities were verified in court, they were bound to the execution ground, and executed by shooting to uphold the law of the country. This proclamation is hereby issued.

The list is as follows: Counter-revolutionary criminals

	Ma Defu Alias Ma Xibo, Ma Chengzhi, male, 29 years old, from Zhuozhou County, Hebei Province, residing at No. 49, West Guanyin Temple, Dongdan, this city.
