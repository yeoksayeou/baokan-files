　　Problems of Increasing Fishery Production and Processing Directions
　　Qin Hanzhang Li Pengling

　　(I)
　　The ocean area accounts for more than three-quarters of the earth. The future development potential of the fishery industry is great, and its economic value is also higher than that of animal husbandry. Generally, each mu of freshwater can produce 120 catties of fish per year, while each mu of pasture can produce a maximum of 45 catties of meat per year; therefore, even if two catties of fish are equivalent to one catty of meat, the income per mu is still more favorable for the fishery industry. As for the nutrients in fish, they are mainly protein and are easier to digest. Therefore, industrially advanced countries pay attention to the development of the fishery industry. The Soviet government has a Ministry of the Fish Industry in its various departments. In 1950, the Soviet Union's food production plan included 1.3 million tons of meat and 2.2 million tons of fish products. The Common Program of our country also stipulates: "Protect coastal fishing grounds and develop the aquatic industry."

　　(II)
　　Our country's coastline is more than 14,000 li long. The coastal areas of Northeast, Hebei, Shandong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, and Guangdong provinces, as well as Taiwan and Hainan Island, are all deep-sea fishing areas, with a fishing ground area of 285,481 square nautical miles. The rivers and lakes scattered inland are also active areas for freshwater fish production. The three major rivers, Songhua River, Yangtze River, and Pearl River, are even richer in freshwater fish resources. Looking at the national natural environment as a whole, the fishery industry should have a good future. According to expert estimates, if China's fishery industry is managed properly, even without the deep-sea fishery being developed, the annual catch can be estimated at more than three million metric tons. In 1936, the annual output was about 1.5 million metric tons. During the Anti-Japanese War, it dropped to an average of about one million metric tons per year. In 1949, it was further reduced to about 450,000 metric tons, less than one-third of the pre-war level.

　　In the past, China's fishery industry failed to develop fully, and even gradually declined. The basic reasons are as follows:

　　(1) Plunder and destruction by reactionary forces and imperialism: During the period of the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, fishery taxes and fees were heavy and bone-scraping. For example, fishermen in Zhoushan had to pay ten kinds of fees to the bandit gangs, including registration fees, license paper fees, boat painting fees, fishing flag fees, escort fees, military subsidy fees, military service substitute fees, ID card fees, fish soup fees, and production team expenses. The exactions imposed on producers by bandit gangs in other fishing areas were roughly similar. If the payment was slightly delayed, they were not allowed to go to sea, and those who returned from the sea were not allowed to unload their fish, causing the catch to suffer spoilage losses. The bandit gangs collected fees for escorting, etc., but pirates ran rampant everywhere, and fishing boats were often robbed. Last winter, in addition to looting and destroying fishing boats, Chiang Kai-shek's bandits blockaded the coastal fishing areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, and fishermen could not go to the deep sea to fish. The fishery industry in Zhoushan suffered serious losses and destruction, and now only one-third remains. The bombing by American planes also damaged many fishing boats. This is the main reason why the national output decreased sharply last year. In addition, for decades, Japanese invaders have been plundering China's territorial waters of their fishery resources. The "Southeast Asia Fisheries Conference" they held earlier designated the coastal areas of China as fishing encroachment areas. Before liberation, new Japanese fishing vessels, still under MacArthur's protection, openly fished across the border.

　　(2) Extremely heavy feudal exploitation: The old-style fishery, which accounts for nine-tenths of China's fishery production, still retains semi-feudal characteristics in its production relations and is often exploited by commercial capital and usury capital. Boat owners who own the means of production exploit fishermen, and distributors (mainly fish merchants) exploit all producers. If the fishing ports and fishing lakes are owned by landlords, producers also have to bear the burden of increased rents. The methods of feudal exploitation are: First, high-interest loans in the production process. Most of the fishermen are extremely poor (boat owners also need to borrow money because the funds required to purchase and repair production tools are huge), and they have to accept harsh conditions and borrow from fish merchants or "fishing brokers" who specialize in heavy-interest exploitation. Monthly interest rates are four or five percent, and some are as high as twenty percent. In the past, during periods of inflation, the principal and interest had to be converted into physical goods for repayment. Fish merchants also used creditor-debtor relationships to monopolize the buying and selling of fish products and manipulate market prices. Second, exploitation by middlemen in the transaction process. The transaction process from producers to consumers in the fishery industry must go through at least five "gates" or seven "gates," and some have as many as ten "gates." The intermediary merchants have deep-rooted malpractices, charging high commissions and suppressing purchase prices. The degree of exploitation is rare in any commercial sector. According to a survey of the Shanghai fish market in July of this year, the commission charged by fish merchants for handling transactions is 14 percent for the seller and 2.5 percent for the buyer, with miscellaneous expenses excluded, totaling about ten items. In addition, due to the monopoly of exclusive sales rights, the prices of fish purchased in various places are much lower than the market price, with some as low as 25 percent or more. The weighing is generally only 80 to 90 catties per 100 catties (fishing scales in Hubei are as large as 160 taels per catty). After going through the fish merchant's gate, so much has already been exploited. If all kinds of exploitation from producers to consumers are added up, the degree of exploitation is shockingly high. According to estimates, the actual income of small producers accounts for only about 10 to 20 percent of what consumers pay.

　　Self-employed fishermen accept high-interest loans and exploitation by middlemen all year round, while boat owners who hire fishermen pass it on to the fishermen to bear. The surplus labor of fishermen is plundered, their lives are impoverished, and their enthusiasm for production is naturally difficult to improve.

　　(3) Backward production technology: Before the war, China had 391 motorized fishing boats, with a total tonnage of 29,370 tons. There were 99,628 old-style fishing boats, with a total tonnage of 747,210 tons. In terms of tonnage, new-style fishery accounted for less than 4 percent of the national total. After the Anti-Japanese War, with the takeover of Japanese and puppet fishery equipment, in 1945, the number of motorized fishing boats increased to 1,099, while the number of old-style fishing boats decreased to 97,145. At present, there are more than 1,200 fishing vessels and motorized sailing boats in the country (Taiwan accounts for nearly 1,000), and about 55,500 old-style fishing boats (including 7,000 in Taiwan). It is estimated that the tonnage of new-style fishing boats has increased to about 10 percent, which is slightly better than before the war; however, old-style fishery still accounts for the vast majority, mostly with backward technology, using old-style nets and hooks, and lacking modern tools, they cannot engage in deep-sea fishing.

　　(III)
　　After liberation, the Ministry of Food Industry of the Central People's Government, in accordance with the provisions of the Common Program, began to restore and develop fishery production. Because old-style fishery still occupies an important position, and state-owned new-style fishery only accounts for a small part; therefore, the main contents of the current fishery policy are to actively build state-owned aquatic enterprises, vigorously support individual fishermen, develop fishermen's cooperative economy in various ways, and encourage private new-style fishery production. In disaster areas, fishermen are mobilized to produce for self-rescue and overcome temporary difficulties. In addition, because of the dense rivers and lakes in the country, freshwater aquaculture is also encouraged. Labor-capital issues are handled according to the principle of mutual benefit.

　　Under this general policy, it was decided that the focus of fishery production in 1950 should be on restoration. The First National Fishery Conference stipulated the minimum figures for fish production in Northeast, North China, East China, and Central South regions in 1950. The Southwest and Northwest regions made their own plans.

　　At present, although the shackles of reactionary forces and imperialism on fishery production have been basically destroyed, the feudal remnants hindering the development of the fishery industry have not been completely eliminated. In order to ensure the completion of the production task, the Ministry of Food Industry of the Central Government and the aquatic administrative institutions in various regions have made special efforts on this issue. On the one hand, they have actively handled various fishery loans. According to statistics as of the end of June this year, the part issued by the Central People's Government alone has reached 40 million catties of millet and 12 billion yuan in RMB. The part handled by the local people's governments is not yet included. Because most regions issued loans in a timely manner, fishermen were able to go to sea earlier. For example, the Liaoxi Branch of the Northeast Bank issued loans in late January this year, and fishermen in Suizhong, Jinxi, and other counties were able to prepare their fishing gear before the Spring Festival. At the same time, loan interest rates have been reduced as much as possible. Although there were still some shortcomings in handling fishery loan business on a national scale for the first time this year, such as the inconsistency between the purpose and use of fishery loans in some places, the lack of focus of loans, and the disconnection between issuance and the fishing season; however, the fact that the beneficiary fishermen have been exempted from or reduced feudal exploitation by obtaining government loans and liberating their productive forces is significant. Some regions have organized fishermen's cooperatives and mutual aid groups to help fishermen purchase means of production and means of livelihood, which can also eliminate the exploitation of middlemen. On the other hand, in order to improve the transportation and sales of fish products, fish markets have been established in major cities and operated by the state. State-owned fish markets in Shanghai, Qingdao, and Yantai in East China have been officially rebuilt in the first half of this year. Transaction markets have been generally established in the coastal areas of Northeast China. In addition to establishing the first aquatic product market in Tianjin, it is also preparing to establish a second one. Fish markets have also been established in Hankou and Guangzhou. These markets directly manage transportation and sales and serve both buyers and sellers. The service fees charged are much lower than those of previous fish merchants. For example, the Tianjin Aquatic Product Market charges a handling fee of 2 percent of the transaction price, which is shared equally by the buyer and the seller. Those who entrust the market to sell on their behalf pay an additional service fee of 1 percent to the entruster. The malpractice of weighing fish with large scales has been eliminated; prices are no longer manipulated by middlemen. In the future, when fish markets are generally established in small and medium-sized cities across the country, they will play a certain role in abolishing feudal exploitation. In addition, some fishing areas have established fishery product promotion societies to help fishermen organize long-distance sales.

　　Due to these material assistance, improved facilities and other measures to protect fishing grounds and develop aquatic products, coupled with the correct leadership of the central and local major agencies, the production tasks in all regions in the first half of the year, except for East China, were completed on schedule, and some even exceeded by a large margin. The completion rate of the annual production plan in the first half of the year was 62.45 percent nationwide, 54.6 percent in the Northeast region, 69.9 percent in the North China region, 45.3 percent in the East China region, and 80.0 percent in the Central South region.

　　The fishery industry has significant characteristics: First, the production areas are concentrated along the coast and lakes, and the catch cannot be easily accessible to consumer markets everywhere; second, production is highly seasonal, and the output in the peak season and the off-season is extremely unbalanced; third, fish are aquatic animals, and they will die and deteriorate in a very short time after leaving the water. However, at the current stage of China's fishery industry, the problems of fish product storage and long-distance transportation have not been fully and effectively resolved. As a result of increased production, some places have experienced an imbalance between production and sales, resulting in fish prices that are either too low or rise and fall sharply and are extremely unstable. For example, in the Honghu area of Hubei, sometimes ten catties of good fresh fish can only be exchanged for one catty of rice; in Shanwei, Guangdong, on the morning of August 21 this year, the price of fish was 3,500 yuan per catty, but in the afternoon, because a batch of fishing boats returned to port, the price of fish immediately dropped to 1,800 yuan.

　　The imbalance between production and sales, the low fish prices in some areas, the backward old-style production technology, the failure to completely eradicate feudal exploitation, and the high cost of fishing have all added up to a considerable burden. According to a survey conducted by the coastal work team of the Dongjiang Special Prefecture in Guangdong before liberation, the main production force of the Shanwei fishing area, the seven-sao boat, had an annual income of 135 million yuan per boat in 1949, calculated based on a catch of 90,000 catties. The annual expenditure was 174,455,000 yuan, and the depreciation and loan interest were not included. The income and expenditure offset each other, resulting in a loss of 39,455,000 yuan. How to open up sales channels and stabilize and rationally set fish prices so that individual fisheries can obtain appropriate profits to expand reproduction is an important issue in the current fishery economy that must be resolved in order to guarantee its recovery and development.

　　The First National Fishery Conference resolved: "Under normal fishery production areas and normal supply and demand conditions, it is generally stipulated that fish prices can be lower than meat prices and equal to grain prices. If there are special circumstances, local governments and state-owned aquatic companies can adjust appropriately." The aquatic authorities in various regions have taken a series of effective measures, such as state-owned aquatic enterprises purchasing fish products in the peak season and helping fishermen organize long-distance sales, in order to moderately regulate supply and demand, ensure reasonable fish prices, so that fishery producers can make a profit or break even, and take into account the interests of consumers. The fish-to-grain price ratio in the coastal areas of Liaodong Province has reached the standard set by the National Fishery Conference, and the fish price trend in other places has also improved.

　　(IV)
　　In addition to the above measures, the solution to the problem of imbalance between production and sales also lies in developing processing industries, facilitating long-distance sales inland, and enabling fish products to be sold abroad. Countries with developed fishery industries attach great importance to fish product processing. There are many methods of fish product processing, including refrigeration, canning, pickling, smoking, natural drying (including sun-drying, air-drying, and wind-drying), salting, and artificial drying. Refrigeration and canning are popular in industrially developed countries, and a few large cities in China have also adopted them; however, because they require more equipment and funds, and some materials cannot be self-sufficient domestically, we can only use the existing foundation for the time being and cannot expand them. Pickling is not in line with Chinese customs. Smoking and natural drying are limited by weather conditions and cannot completely remove water, and they are prone to deterioration and loss of nutrients during the manufacturing process, making it impossible to become a large-scale, year-round continuous fish product processing industry.

　　Salting and salt-drying are old methods in our country, widely used by fishermen, who often carry fish salt with them and salt as they fish. A portion of this is made into salt-dried fish using natural drying methods. This method is simple and easy to implement, and the production cost is low. The National Fishery Conference decided to vigorously operate aquatic product processing, especially the manufacture of salt-dried fish, in order to coordinate with this year's production tasks. The production of salt-dried fish is the focus of the state-owned aquatic product processing plan. According to the current surplus of salt production in our country, it is necessary to temporarily produce more salt-dried fish to coordinate with the production and sales of the salt industry. The Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government has therefore set preferential measures for the price of salt for fishery use, and the salt tax for fishery use is collected at 30 percent of the salt tax rate. However, from a nutritional point of view, salting and salt-drying methods will destroy some of the nutrients in the fish body, especially protein, and will cause a slight degree of corruption and dissolution. Salted fish is not an ideal modern food. This can be answered and proven in the direction of fish product processing in the friendly Soviet Union. Due to the development of their refrigeration and canning industries, this ancient processing method has almost disappeared.

　　The above methods that our country has adopted in the past have their own shortcomings. Based on existing experience, artificial drying methods have many advantages, so the current fish product processing can simultaneously try this method in addition to focusing on the salt-drying method.

　　Artificial drying uses machinery to make dried fish products, such as heating air, superheated steam, desiccant, vacuum, inert gas, or direct heating methods. In addition to the common advantages of modern methods such as mass production and widespread supply, these simple artificial drying methods also have some other favorable conditions.

　　First, after artificial drying, the moisture in the fish product is removed as much as possible, and the volume is reduced. The space required for storage and transportation is more economical than other methods, and storage and transportation costs can be greatly reduced, which is in line with the policy of low prices and widespread sales to the public, and is conducive to long-distance sales from the coast and lakes to the interior. Second, the dried fish produced by artificial drying is crisp but not scorched, contracted but not deformed, and also hygienic, which meets the necessary conditions for selling abroad. The fish meal made from the scraps left over from stripping is also suitable for foreign needs. This is in line with the policy of "expanding domestic sales and striving for exports." Third, artificial drying requires less drying space and simpler equipment. It requires less capital and does not need to order machines from abroad, unlike refrigeration and canning, which require complex standard equipment. Fourth, the organic components of the dried fish produced by artificial drying are protected from deterioration, and the inorganic components are fully retained. The nutritional value is higher than that of products produced by natural drying, smoking, and salting methods. In addition, the volume of dried fish is highly contracted, and the nutrients contained in each unit of weight are richer than those of any processing method. This has special significance and value in military food supply.

　　In summary, the products of artificial drying have the conditions of being cheap, good, popular, and convenient for organizing inland transportation and sales and exports. Among modern processing methods, the construction cost of its basic construction is also more economical. It is a new direction worth promoting in domestic fish product processing. This method is more advisable to consider based on local conditions, but it must have a specific design, suitable equipment, skilled technology, and considerable experience, so it must be carefully planned and arranged as early as possible, or it can be tried out in new-style aquatic businesses first, in the hope that it can be gradually and smoothly promoted.

　　渔业增产问题与加工方向
    秦含章　李彭龄
    （一）
    地球上海洋面积占四分之三以上。渔业将来发展的可能性是很大的，它的经济价值也比畜牧业为高。通常每市亩淡水每年产鱼可达一百二十市斤，而每市亩牧地每年所产的肉类最高不超过四十五市斤；因此，即以两斤鱼抵一斤肉计算，每亩收益，也是渔业比较优厚。至于鱼的营养素中，以蛋白质为主，且较易消化。因此，工业先进国家，都注重渔业的发展。苏联政府各部门中设有鱼业工业部，一九五○年苏联的食品生产计划，肉类为一百三十万吨，鱼品则为二百二十万吨。我国共同纲领也规定：“保护沿海渔场，发展水产业。”
    （二）
    我国海岸线长达一万四千余里。东北、河北、山东、江苏、浙江、福建、广东诸省区以及台湾、海南岛的沿海，均为远洋渔区，渔场面积计二八五、四八一方海里；散布内陆的河流湖泊又都是淡水鱼的活动区域，松花江、长江、珠江三大河流，更富于淡水鱼产。综观全国自然环境，渔业应有很好的前途。据专家估计，中国渔业如经营得法，即远洋渔业还没有发达，每年渔获量估计也可达三百万公吨以上，一九三六年的年产量约达一百五十万公吨，抗战期间，降至每年平均约一百万公吨，一九四九年更减为四十五万公吨左右，不及战前三分之一。
    过去我国渔业未能充分发展，甚至逐渐减产，基本原因约举如下：
    （１）反动势力与帝国主义的掠夺摧残：在国民党反动统治时期，渔业税费苛重，敲骨吸髓。如舟山渔民须为匪帮缴纳登记费、执照纸张费、刷船费、渔旗费、护航费、军用补助费、军差代役费、身份证费、鱼羹费和生产大队经费等十种。其余各渔区生产者对匪帮赋役的苛索，大致类此。如交缴稍迟，即不准出海，出海回来的也不让卸鱼，使渔获物遭受变质的损失。匪帮抽收了护航等费，但海盗到处横行，渔船仍经常遭到劫掠。去年冬天蒋匪除劫夺渔轮及破坏渔船以外，更封锁江浙沿海渔区，渔民不能到远洋捕鱼；舟山渔业受到严重损失破坏，现仅余三分之一。美机的轰炸，更毁损渔船不少。去年全国产量所以剧减，这是主因。此外，数十年来日寇一直掠夺我国领海的渔产；它以前所召开的“东南亚渔业会议”指定中国沿海为侵渔地区。解放前日本新式渔轮，仍在麦克阿瑟庇护下越界公开捕鱼。
    （２）封建剥削奇重：占我国渔业生产十分之九的旧式渔业，其生产关系仍保留着半封建的性质，经常受商业资本和高利贷资本的剥削，拥有生产手段的船东剥削渔工，运销商（主要是渔行）则又剥削一切生产者，渔港渔湖如系地主所有，生产者还要增加租项的负担。封建剥削的方式：第一是生产过程中的高利贷。渔户大部赤贫（船东亦以购办修理生产工具所需资金庞大，有时亦需举债），不得不接受苛刻条件，向专以重利盘剥为业的渔行或“渔补子”申借。月息四、五分，有高至两角者。过去通货膨胀时期还要折成实物偿付本息。渔行且利用债权关系垄断鱼产的买卖，操纵市场价格。第二是交易过程中居间商人的剥削。渔业由生产者到消费者中间的交易过程，至少须经过五“关”或七“关”，有多至十余“关”的，居间的行栈积弊很深，抽收高度佣金，压低收价，大秤收鱼，剥削的苛重程度，为任何商业部门所罕见。据本年七月间上海鱼市场的调查，鱼行经办买卖，一转手间抽收的佣金，卖方达百分之十四，买方为百分之二点五，杂费在外，什名目共计约达十种。又因垄断了专卖权，各地收鱼的价格远较市价为低，有低至百分之二十五以上者，秤量则一百斤一般只作八十余至九十斤（湖北的渔秤有大至每斤一百六十两者）。经过渔行这一关，已被剥削了这许多，如把生产者到消费者间各种剥削并计，高度实足惊人，据估计，小生产者的实收，大约仅占消费者所付的百分之十到二十。
    自营生产的渔户，终年接受高利贷和中间商人的剥削，那些雇工捕鱼的船东，则把它转嫁给渔工来负担。渔工的剩余劳动被掠夺了去，生活贫困，生产的积极性自然难望提高。
    （３）生产技术落后：我国战前计有机器渔船三九一艘，总吨数二九、三七○吨。旧式渔船九九、六二八只，总吨数七四七、二一○吨，就吨量言，新式渔业尚不及全国百分之四。抗战后接收日伪渔业设备，一九四五年，机器渔船增至一、○九九艘，旧式渔船，则减为九七、一四五只。目前全国共有渔轮及机帆船一千二百余艘（台湾所占将近千艘），旧式渔船约五五、五○○余只（台湾七○○○只在内）；估计新式渔船吨量已增至约占百分之十，较战前虽略有进步；但旧式渔业，仍占绝大比重，大都技术落后，采用旧式的网、钩，因为缺乏近代化的工具，也不能从事远洋捕鱼。
    （三）
    解放后，中央人民政府食品工业部遵照共同纲领的规定，着手渔业生产的恢复和发展。由于旧式渔业仍占重要地位，新式渔业中国营的又仅占一小部分；因此，目前渔业政策的主要内容是积极建设国营水产企业，大力扶助个体渔民，多方发展渔民合作经济，并鼓励私营新式渔业生产，在灾区则发动渔民生产自救，克服暂时困难。此外，因国内河流湖泊密布，淡水养殖亦予奖励。劳资问题，根据两利原则处理。
    在这个总的方针下，决定一九五○年的渔业生产以恢复为主。第一届全国渔业会议曾规定一九五○年东北、华北、华东、中南各区鱼产量的最低数字。西南、西北两区则由其自行计划。
    目前反动势力和帝国主义对渔业生产的桎梏，虽已基本上被摧毁，但阻碍渔业发展的封建残余则尚未被彻底肃清，为保证生产任务的完成，中央食品工业部和各地区水产行政机构在这个问题上特别用力。一方面积极办理各种渔业贷款，仅截至本年六月底止的统计，中央人民政府发放的部分已达小米四千万斤，及人民币一百二十亿元。地方人民政府办理的部分尚未计算在内。由于大多数地区贷放及时，使渔民能提前下海；例如，东北银行辽西分行今年一月底就发放贷款，绥中、锦西等县渔民春节前就可准备好了渔具。同时，贷款利息则极力降低。本年度初次在全国规模内办理渔贷业务，虽还存在了一些缺点，如有些地方的渔贷目的与用途不一致，贷款没有重点以及发放与渔汛时间脱节等；但受益的渔民因获得政府贷款而免除或减轻封建剥削，解放了他们的生产力，则是显著的事实。若干地区组织了渔民合作社和互助小组，帮助渔民购办生产资料和生活资料，也可免除中间商人的剥削。另一方面，为改进鱼品运销，各大城市设立了鱼市场，由国家经营。华东区上海、青岛、烟台各国营鱼市场，已于本年上半年正式改建；东北沿海地带，普遍成立交易市场；天津于成立第一个水产市场之外，还准备设立第二个；汉口、广州亦已成立鱼市场。这些市场直接管理运销，为买卖双方服务。所收服务费远较以前的鱼行为低，例如，天津水产市场系依成交价格征收场务手续费百分之二，买卖双方平均负担，其委托市场代卖者，另由委托人交纳服务费百分之一。大秤收鱼的弊端，固已革除；价格也不再被中间商人操纵。将来全国各中小城市普遍设置鱼市场以后，对废除封建剥削当起一定作用。此外，若干渔区已成立渔产推销社，帮助渔民组织远销。
    由于这些物质帮助，改进设施和其他保护渔场发展水产的举措，加上中央及地方主要机关的正确领导，上半年各地区的生产任务，除华东外皆能如期完成，有的且超过颇多，全年生产计划上半年的完成百分率，全国总计为六二·四五，东北区为五四·六，华北区为六九·九，华东区为四五·三，中南区为八○·○。
    渔业具有显著的特性：第一，产区集中沿海沿湖，渔获物不能随处接近消费市场；第二，生产有高度的季节性，旺季与淡季产量极不平衡；第三，鱼是水产动物，离开了水很短时间内，就会死亡变质。而现阶段的中国渔业，鱼品储藏和远输问题尚未能全部有效解决，增产结果，有些地方遂发生产销失衡的现象，以致鱼价或失诸过低，或暴涨暴落，极不稳定。如湖北洪湖区域，有时要十斤好鲜鱼才换得一斤大米；广东汕尾今年八月二十一日上午鱼价每斤三千五百元，下午因有渔船一批回港，鱼价立刻降至一千八百元。
    产销失调，局部地区鱼价过低，而旧式生产技术落后，封建剥削尚未能全部铲除，捕鱼成本又复颇高。据广东东江专署沿海工作队在解放前的调查，汕尾渔区生产主力的七艕船，一九四九年每艘全年收入，按渔获量九万斤计算，得款一亿三千五百万元，全年支出一亿七千四百五十五万元，折旧费和借款利息还没有包括在内，收支相抵已亏折三千九百五十五万元。如何打开销路，稳定与合理订定鱼价，使个体渔业获得适当利润，以扩大再生产，在目前渔业经济中是一个重要问题，必须设法解决，才能保证它的恢复和发展。
    第一次全国渔业会议曾决议：“在正常的渔产地区和正常的供求情形下，一般规定，鱼价可低于肉价等于粮价，如有特殊情况，当地政府和国营水产公司可适当调整”。各地区的水产主管机关已采取了一系列的有效措施，如旺季由国营水产企业收购鱼品，帮助渔民组织远销，以期适度调节供求，保证合理鱼价，使渔业生产者有利可图或保本自给，并兼顾消费者的利益。辽东省沿海的鱼粮比价即已达到了全国渔业会议所定的标准，其他地方鱼价趋势亦已好转。
    （四）
    产销失调问题的解决，除应采取上述措施外，发展加工事业，便利内地远销，使鱼品能推销国外，也是解决问题的重要关键。渔业发达的国家对渔产加工都十分重视。渔产加工方法颇多，有冷藏、罐藏、醋渍、熏制、自然干制（包括阳干、气干、风干），盐腌和人工干制等。冷藏法和罐藏法盛行于工业发达国家，我国少数大城市也已采用；因需要设备和资金较多，一部分材料国内尚未能自给，暂时只好利用原有基础，还不能予以扩展。醋制法不合中国习惯。熏制法和自然干制法，受天时环境限制，去水不够彻底，且在制造过程中，易于因变质而丧失营养成份，不可能成为大规模的终年不断的渔产加工事业。
    盐腌、盐干是我国的老方法，渔民普遍采用，渔船常带了鱼盐，随渔随腌，其中一部分用自然干制法制成盐干鱼。此法简单易行，生产成本较低。全国渔业会议为配合本年度上项生产任务，决定大力经营水产加工，特别是盐干鱼的制造。在国营水产加工计划中，且以盐干鱼的生产为重点。按目前我国食盐产量过剩，暂时多制盐干鱼，配合盐业的产销，自有必要。中央人民政府财政部对渔业用盐的价格因此定有优待办法，渔业用盐按食盐税率收百分之三十。但从营养上研究，盐腌与盐干法会破坏鱼体中一部分养分——特别是蛋白质，多少要引起轻度的腐败和溶解作用，盐鱼不是现代的理想食品，这在友邦苏联渔产加工方向上已可得到解答和证明；由于他们冷藏和罐藏工业的发达，这种古老的加工法几已绝迹。
    以上几种过去我国采行过的方法都各有缺点。根据已有的经验，人工干制法具有种种优点，所以当前渔产加工除重视盐干法外，可同时试行这个方法。
    人工干制法系利用机械来做成干制鱼品，如利用加热空气，过热蒸汽，干燥剂，真空度，不活性气体，或直接加热等法这类简易的人工干制法除具有大量生产，普遍供应等现代化方法的共通优点外，另外还具备了一些有利的条件。
    第一、鱼品经过人工干制，水分尽量除去，体积缩小，储运所需空间位置较其他方法经济，储运费用可大大节减，符合低价而使广销于人民大众的方针，利于自沿海沿湖远销内地。第二、人工干制法生产的鱼干，干脆而未焦灼，收缩而未改形，也适合卫生，具备了推销国外的必要条件。剥制剩下来的碎料做成的鱼粉，也适合国外的需要。这正符合“扩展内销，争取出口”的方针。第三、人工干制法所用的干燥场地较小，设备比较简单。资金较省，且无须向国外订购机器，不若冷藏法与罐藏法之需要繁复的标准设备。第四、人工干制法所产的鱼干，有机的成份得免变质，无机的成份得全保持，营养价值较自然干制法，熏制法和盐腌法等的产品为高。又鱼干的体积高度干缩，每一单位重量所含的营养成份较任何加工方法的产品为丰富；这在军粮供应上尤有特殊的意义和价值。
    综上所述，人工干制法的产品具了价廉、物美、大众化与便利组织内地运销和出口的条件，在现代化的加工方法中，其基本建设的工程费用也较节省，不失为国内渔产加工上值得提倡的一个新方向。这个方法就因时因地制宜来考虑是比较可取的，但要有具体的设计，合适的设备，熟练的技术和相当的经验，所以必须及早缜密筹划，妥为布置，或可先后新式水产事业试办，期能逐步顺利推行。
