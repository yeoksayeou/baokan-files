　　MacArthur Illegally Releases Class A War Criminal Mamoru Shigemitsu
    Soviet Union Lodges Strong Protest with the United States; Chinese Foreign Minister Zhou Issues Statement Supporting Soviet Position
    [Xinhua News Agency, 23rd] MacArthur, head of the US occupation forces in Japan, disregarding protests from the Soviet government and world progressive public opinion, has illegally released Class A war criminal Mamoru Shigemitsu from prison and continues to announce the "parole" of other war criminals. According to a United Press report from Tokyo: Mamoru Shigemitsu, a Class A war criminal who was announced "paroled" on November 8th, was released from Sugamo Prison on the 21st. According to an Associated Press report: MacArthur's legal team announced on the 21st the "parole" of six Japanese war criminals, including one captain and one lieutenant; they will be released on December 3rd. Since MacArthur arbitrarily issued the fifth directive "paroling" war criminals on March 7th, he officially announced the "parole" of the first group of six war criminals on May 1st. To date, he has approved the "parole" of 148 war criminals. 128 of them have already been released from prison, and the most recently approved three batches of twenty will be released on November 22nd, 28th, and December 3rd respectively.
    [Xinhua News Agency, 23rd] The Soviet government sent a note to the US government on November 19th, protesting MacArthur's violation of the Far East International Military Tribunal's verdict in unilaterally releasing Japanese Class A war criminal Mamoru Shigemitsu. The note reiterated the demands made in the Soviet government's two notes to the US government on May 11th and August 25th: to rescind MacArthur's illegal and unilateral Directive No. 5 on the early release of Japanese war criminals. A copy of the Soviet government's November 19th note has been delivered to the Central People's Government of our country by the Soviet Embassy in China.
    The full text of the Soviet government's November 19th note to the US government is as follows: "The Embassy of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, acting on instructions from its government, hereby informs the Department of State of the United States of America of the following:
    On November 8th of this year, General MacArthur's headquarters issued a statement announcing the forthcoming release on November 21st of this year of Mamoru Shigemitsu, one of the Japanese Class A war criminals, whose term of imprisonment has not yet expired. This individual should be held responsible for the Japanese militarist clique's launching of wars of aggression, and was sentenced to seven years of imprisonment on November 19, 1948, by the Far East International Military Tribunal, composed of representatives from the Soviet Union, the United States, Great Britain, China, France, the Netherlands, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, India, and the Philippines.
    The release of Mamoru Shigemitsu is based on MacArthur's illegal Directive No. 5 issued on March 7th of this year, in which General MacArthur unilaterally decided on the early release of war criminals sentenced by the International Military Tribunal.
    In its two notes of May 11th and August 25th of this year, the Soviet government called the attention of the US government to the illegal actions of General MacArthur, who, by issuing the aforementioned directive, violated the agreement on the establishment of the Far East International Military Tribunal, violated the regulations of this tribunal, and undermined the Far Eastern Commission's decision of April 3, 1946, "on the arrest, trial and punishment of Far East war criminals," and the Soviet government insisted on rescinding this directive.
    Everyone knows that neither the regulations of the International Military Tribunal nor the decision of the Far Eastern Commission of April 3, 1946, provide for the early release of Japanese Class A war criminals after the sentences have been submitted for execution. Any decision on such matters must first be agreed upon by all countries participating in the International Military Tribunal, but this condition has not been observed in the above-mentioned case.
    In view of the above facts, the Soviet government reaffirms its position as expressed in its two notes of May 11th and August 25th of this year, and considers that the US government should be held responsible for any illegal and unilateral actions that General MacArthur may take regarding the early release of Japanese Class A war criminals, including Mamoru Shigemitsu, which may be detrimental to the cause of maintaining international peace."
    Copies of the above note were also sent to the governments of other member states of the Far Eastern Commission.
    [Xinhua News Agency, 23rd] Chinese Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai of the Central People's Government issued the following statement regarding MacArthur's unauthorized release of Japanese Class A war criminal Mamoru Shigemitsu:
    On November 8, 1950, MacArthur's headquarters issued a statement announcing the imminent release on November 21st of this year of Mamoru Shigemitsu, one of the Japanese Class A war criminals whose term of imprisonment had not yet expired. This illegal action has aroused the indignation of the Chinese people. Following the two notes to the US government on May 11th and August 25th, the Soviet government once again submitted a note to the US government on the 19th of this month, reiterating the Soviet government's position, pointing out that the US government should be held responsible for MacArthur's illegal release of Japanese Class A war criminal Mamoru Shigemitsu, and insisting on rescinding MacArthur's directive of March 7, 1950. The Soviet government's solemn position has won the resolute support of the Chinese people.
    As early as March 7th of this year, after MacArthur announced the illegal Directive No. 5, I, on behalf of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, endorsed the solemn demands put forward in the Soviet government's note to the US government on May 11th, condemned MacArthur for undermining the solemn verdict of the Far East International Military Tribunal in punishing Japanese war criminals, and reminded the US government that MacArthur's illegal and ultra vires actions must be stopped.
    As is well known, Mamoru Shigemitsu is a butcher who massacred the Chinese people; Mamoru Shigemitsu is one of the direct instigators of the Japanese fascist aggression against China on September 18, 1931. During the Sino-Japanese War and the Pacific War, Mamoru Shigemitsu was one of the Class A war criminals responsible for the Japanese fascists' launching of wars of aggression. The US imperialist representative MacArthur is plotting to support Japanese fascism in order to resume aggression, which the Chinese people absolutely cannot tolerate.
    The US government disregarded the solemn statement of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China on May 15th and rejected the solemn demands put forward in the two notes of the Soviet government on May 11th and August 25th. This shows that the cases of early release of Japanese war criminals and early release of Japanese Class A war criminal Mamoru Shigemitsu are not only MacArthur's illegal actions but also illegal actions of the US government. I solemnly declare on behalf of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China that the Central People's Government's position on the issue of MacArthur's unauthorized release of Japanese war criminals, including Mamoru Shigemitsu, is completely consistent with that of the Soviet government. We do not recognize any of the illegal actions of the US government in condoning MacArthur's unilateral order of March 7th to unilaterally stipulate the early release of Japanese war criminals, and the unauthorized release of Mamoru Shigemitsu, one of the Japanese Class A war criminals whose term of imprisonment has not yet expired, on November 8th. At the same time, we solemnly declare that the US government should be fully responsible for the serious consequences caused by MacArthur's unauthorized early release of Japanese war criminals, including Mamoru Shigemitsu, which are detrimental to the cause of maintaining international peace, and reserves all rights to demand the legal punishment of Japanese war criminals, including Class A war criminal Mamoru Shigemitsu.
    November 23, 1950, in Beijing

　　麦克阿瑟非法释放甲级战犯重光葵
    苏联照会美国提出严重抗议我周外长声明支持苏联立场
    【新华社二十三日讯】美国驻日占领军首脑麦克阿瑟，不顾苏联政府及世界进步舆论的抗议，非法释放甲级战犯重光葵出狱，并继续宣布“假释”其他战犯。据合众社东京讯：十一月八日被宣布“假释”的甲级战犯重光葵，已于二十一日自巢鸭监狱释放。另据美联社消息：麦克阿瑟法律组二十一日又宣布“假释”包括大尉及中尉各一名的日本战犯六名，他们将于十二月三日出狱。麦克阿瑟在三月七日擅自颁发“假释”战犯的第五号指令后，自五月一日开始正式宣布“假释”第一批战犯六名，到目前为止，共批准“假释”战犯达一百四十八名。其中一百二十八人业已出狱，最近批准的三批二十人，则将分别在十一月二十二日、二十八日及十二月三日出狱。
    【新华社二十三日讯】苏联政府于十一月十九日以照会一件送致美国政府，该照会中抗议麦克阿瑟违反远东国际军事法庭的判决，擅自释放日本甲级战犯重光葵，并重申苏联政府五月十一日和八月二十五日致美国政府的两次照会中所坚持的要求：撤销麦克阿瑟非法地、片面地决定的提前释放日本战犯的第五号指令。苏联政府十一月十九日照会的副本，已由苏联驻我国大使馆递交我中央人民政府。
    苏联政府十一月十九日致美国政府照会全文如下：“苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟大使馆奉本国政府的训令，谨将下述事实通知美利坚合众国国务院：
    本年十一月八日，麦克阿瑟将军总部发布声明，宣告即将于本年十一月二十一日释放刑期尚未届满的日本甲级战犯之一重光葵，按该犯应对日本军国主义集团发动侵略战争负责，并已根据由苏联、美国、大不列颠、中国、法国、荷兰、加拿大、澳大利亚、新西兰、印度和菲律宾等国代表组成的远东国际军事法庭的判决，于一九四八年十一月十九日宣布处徒刑七年。
    重光葵的释放是根据麦克阿瑟将军于本年三月七日发布的非法的第五号指令，在该指令内，麦克阿瑟将军片面地决定了提前释放由国际军事法庭宣判的战犯的命令。
    苏联政府在本年五月十一日与八月二十五日的两次照会中，曾提醒美国政府注意麦克阿瑟将军的非法行动，他曾经发布上述指令，因而违反了关于建立远东国际军事法庭的协定、触犯这个法庭的规章，并且破坏了一九四六年四月三日远东委员会“关于逮捕、审判与惩处远东战犯”的决定，苏联政府并坚持撤销此项指令。
    谁都知道，不管是国际军事法庭的规章或者一九四六年四月三日远东委员会的决定，都没有规定在判决书呈交执行后提前释放日本甲级战犯。在这种问题上采取决定必须先由参加国际军事法庭的各国获得协议，而上述案件却并没有遵守此项条件。
    苏联政府根据上述事实，确申其在本年五月十一日与八月二十五日两照会中所表明的立场，并认为美国政府对麦克阿瑟将军就提前释放包括重光葵在内的日本甲级战犯一事所可能采取的有害于维持国际和平事业的非法片面行动，应负责任。”
    上项照会的副本同时分别送致远东委员会其他各会员国政府。
    【新华社二十三日讯】我中央人民政府外交部周恩来部长就麦克阿瑟擅自释放日本甲级战犯重光葵一事发表声明如下：
    一九五○年十一月八日麦克阿瑟总部发表声明，宣布即将于本年十一月二十一日释放刑期尚未届满的日本甲级战犯之一的重光葵。这一非法举动，业已引起中国人民的义愤。苏联政府继五月十一日及八月二十五日两次致美国政府照会之后，复于本月十九日向美国政府提出照会，重申苏联政府立场，指明美国政府对麦克阿瑟的非法释放日本甲级战犯重光葵的行为，应负责任，并坚持撤消麦克阿瑟一九五○年三月七日的指令。苏联政府这一严正立场，获得了中国人民的坚决支持。
    远在本年三月七日麦克阿瑟公布非法的第五号指令之后，我曾代表中华人民共和国中央人民政府，赞同苏联政府五月十一日致美国政府照会中所提出的严正要求，谴责麦克阿瑟破坏远东国际军事法庭惩治日本战犯的庄严判决，并提醒美国政府对于麦克阿瑟此项违法越权的行为，必须予以制止。
    如所周知，重光葵是一个屠杀中国人民的刽子手；重光葵是日本法西斯主义一九三一年九月十八日发动侵略中国战争的直接策动者之一。在中日战争中，太平洋战争中，重光葵是应对日本法西斯主义者发动侵略战争负有责任的甲级战犯之一。美帝国主义的代表者麦克阿瑟阴谋扶植日本法西斯主义，以便重新进行侵略，这是中国人民绝对不能容忍的。
    美国政府不顾中华人民共和国中央人民政府五月十五日的严正声明，并拒绝苏联政府五月十一日和八月二十五日两次照会中所提出的严正要求，这就表示：提前释放日本战犯以及提前释放日本甲级战犯重光葵等案，不仅是麦克阿瑟的非法行为，同样是美国政府的非法行为。我代表中华人民共和国中央人民政府郑重声明，中央人民政府对于麦克阿瑟擅自释放包括重光葵在内的日本战犯问题所采取的立场，与苏联政府完全一致。我们对于美国政府纵容麦克阿瑟三月七日以单方命令擅自规定提前释放日本战犯，以及十一月八日擅自释放刑期尚未届满的日本甲级战犯之一的重光葵的各种非法行为，一概不予承认，同时郑重声明：美国政府对于麦克阿瑟擅自提前释放包括重光葵在内的日本战犯以致引起有害于维持国际和平事业的严重后果，应负完全责任，并保留要求依法惩办日本战犯，包括甲级战犯重光葵在内的一切权利。
    一九五○年十一月二十三日于北京
