    Introduction to the Chinese Edition, Issue 64
    The Chinese edition of "Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy!" Issue 64, has been published.
    The editorial in this issue is entitled "Strengthening Local Organs of Power in People's Democratic States." The editorial states: The establishment of people's parliaments in Bulgaria, Poland, Romania, Hungary, and Albania, and the establishment of the Czechoslovak National Committee exercising the functions of a people's parliament, mark an important stage in the political development of people's democratic states, and in the further democratization of the regimes in these countries. The editorial continues: The strengthening of local organs of power—people's parliaments—in people's democratic states is the result of victories in the struggle against the conspiracies of enemies, both internal and external, of the people's democratic system, and the result of the further consolidation of the worker-peasant alliance and the leading role of the working class in this alliance. The editorial points out: Thanks to the assistance of the Soviet Red Army, the people of the people's democratic states have shattered the chains of imperialism and have the possibility of establishing and strengthening people's democratic regimes as a form of the dictatorship of the proletariat. In the course of the struggle, the old state machinery has been gradually destroyed, and a new state machinery has been gradually established. However, it should be noted here that the reorganization of local organs of power in people's democratic states has proceeded much slower than the establishment of central organs of power. In the past few years, there have also been great changes in this regard, but the old vestiges of local government organs have not been completely eliminated, the control over the work of local organs has not yet been extended to all local organs of power, and there are still many things to be done to make lower-level organs of power closer to the people. The editorial states: As the temporary organs of state power that previously existed are replaced by people's parliaments elected by the various localities, the vestiges of the old administrative system, which was controlled by exploiters to prevent the people from managing the country, are being gradually eliminated. With the implementation of the people's parliament system, all state organs of power in the people's democratic states, from top to bottom, are composed of representatives elected by and responsible to the people. This is how the provisions in the constitutions of all people's democratic states that "all power belongs to the working people and comes from the working people" are realized. The editorial points out: Through the people's parliaments and the various standing committees directly under them (planning, finance, public health, mass education, culture and education, etc.), the masses of the people have broad possibilities to participate in the management of state affairs. The editorial states: The Communist and Workers' Parties are the guiding, organizing, and inspiring forces in people's democratic states. The people's parliaments are the broadest mass organizations, linking millions of non-Party working people with the vanguard of the working class—the Communist and Workers' Parties. They strengthen the direct link between the working people and the people's democratic states through their daily work, inspiring the people's tremendous creative ability, their organizational genius, and their creative initiative.
    This issue of the journal publishes "The Development of Socialist Law in People's Democratic Czechoslovakia" by Reis, Minister of Justice of the Czechoslovak Republic, and "The Election of Local Councils in Hungary" by Zold, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Workers' Party, vividly illustrating the increasing strength of local organs of power in people's democratic states.
    This issue of the journal also publishes an essay by Matun, Secretary of the Political Bureau of the German Socialist Unity Party, entitled "The Spies of American Imperialism Have Been Exposed," which discusses the German Socialist Unity Party's recent purge of a group of American spies. In addition, it publishes articles by the people of Argentina and Spain on their struggle for peace.

　　《争取持久和平，争取人民民主！》
    中文版第六十四期介绍
    《争取持久和平，争取人民民主!》中文版第六十四期已经出版。
    该刊本期的社论题为《人民民主国家中地方政权机关的加强》。社论说：保加利亚、波兰、罗马尼亚、匈牙利和阿尔巴尼亚的人民议会的成立，以及行使人民议会职权的捷克斯洛伐克民族委员会的成立，在人民民主国家的政治发展上，在这些国家政权的进一步民主化上，划出了一个重要的阶段。社论继称：人民民主国家中地方政权机关——人民议会——的加强，是对人民民主制度的内外敌人的阴谋进行斗争获得胜利的结果，是工农联盟以及工人阶级在这个联盟中的领导作用之进一步巩固的结果。社论指出：由于苏联红军的援助，各人民民主国家的人民已粉碎了帝国主义的锁链，并有了建立并加强作为无产阶级专政的一种形式的人民民主政权的种种可能性。在斗争过程中，旧的国家机器已被逐步摧毁，而新的国家机器则被逐步建立起来了。然而在这里应该注意的是，改组人民民主国家政权的地方机关，其进行速度，要比建立中央政权机关慢得多。在过去数年中，在这方面也有了很大的变革，但是地方政府机关旧的残余还未完全肃清，对于地方机关工作的管制还没有扩大到所有的地方政权机关，在使下层政权机关更能紧靠人民方面，也还有许多事情等待去做。社论说：由于各地方选出人民议会以代替前此存在的临时性的国家政权机构，掌握在剥削者手中用以阻止人民管理国家的旧行政制度的残余正被逐渐肃清。随着人民议会制度的实施，人民民主国家所有的国家政权机构，自上到下，都是由人民选出并对人民负责的代表来组成的了。所有人民民主国家宪法中关于“一切权力属于劳动人民和来自劳动人民”的规定，就是这样地实现了。社论指出：通过人民议会及直属于它的各种常设委员会（计划、财政、公共卫生、大众教育、文教等），人民群众有了参加管理国家工作的广泛的可能性。社论说：共产党和工人党是人民民主国家的指导、组织和鼓舞的力量。人民议会是最广大的群众组织，它们把几百万非党的劳动人民和工人阶级的先锋队——共产党和工人党——联系起来。它们以每天的工作来加强劳动人民和人民民主国家之间的直接联系，启发人民的巨大的创造能力，他们的组织天才，他们的创造积极性。
    该刊本期刊登了捷克斯洛伐克人民共和国司法部长瑞斯写的“社会主义法律在人民民主的捷克斯洛伐克的发展”，和匈牙利工人党中央委员会政治局委员佐尔德写的“匈牙利地方议会的选举”两篇文章，生动地说明了在人民民主国家中地方政权机关正日益加强。
    该刊本期并登载了德国统一社会党政治局书记马吞所作的论述德国统一社会党最近清洗一批美国特务的事件的题为“美帝国主义的特务被揭露了”的论文，另外还登载了阿根廷、西班牙人民为和平斗争的文章。
