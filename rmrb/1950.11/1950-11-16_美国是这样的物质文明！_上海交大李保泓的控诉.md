Editor's Note: Li Baohong, a fourth-year student in the Department of Telecommunications Management at Shanghai Jiaotong University, went to the United States for training in 1944 under the deceptive call for youth to join the army by the Kuomintang reactionaries at the time. He was studying to be a naval radar technician. Combining the recent atrocities of the American imperialists in Korea with his personal experiences during training in the United States, he confirms that the insane behavior of the United States is absolutely true.

I am angry, I can no longer remain silent. I want to report my experiences and feelings to my fellow students; let us awaken from our illusions about American imperialism and fully recognize the so-called "material civilization" of American imperialism.

In 1944, six years ago today, when the iron hooves of the Japanese invaders crossed the vast fields of our motherland, and Changsha, Guilin, and Dushan in Guizhou were occupied, the whole country was in chaos and on the verge of life and death. Our Jiaotong University set off a wave of enthusiasm for joining the army in Jiulongpo, Chongqing. Hundreds of students participated in translation, air force, army, and navy. At that time, I was a sophomore in the Department of Naval Architecture and, along with the other eighty-nine students, joined the navy to go to the United States for training. I want to tell everyone about the situation along the way and after arriving, to see what the true face of American imperialism is.

On the eve of going abroad, at Xinjin Airport near Chengdu, when boarding the plane, the Americans asked us to take off our pants in the freezing cold of the twelfth lunar month to check for hemorrhoids, refusing to recognize the examination certificate from the Chongqing Municipal Hospital. In India, the Americans burned all the things we brought from China and sprayed us with DDT, as if we came from a savage country with bacteria all over our bodies. On the transport ship from Bombay to the United States, they put us, over a thousand Chinese sailors and black people, in one cabin, and only allowed over three thousand people to move around on the aft deck, completely isolated from the white Americans. Passing through Australia, we were not allowed to land in New Gold Mountain (San Francisco) because Australia does not allow people of color to come ashore. During our training in the United States, the American imperialists often treated us as Chinese laborers, asking us to empty their garbage cans, sweep the floor, and empty spittoons. Once, I angrily resisted, and I was punished with fifteen days of confinement in jail for "disobeying orders." They never treated the Chinese as human beings. The group of American sailors we came into contact with were all brainless people; they only knew about women and enjoyment because they were educated that way. The capitalists paralyzed the minds and conscience of the soldiers as tools of domination, enslavement, and aggression. In the United States, we did see many planes, airports, gasoline depots, docks, and steel plants, so we would not doubt how American capitalists seized the fruits of these working people in the early days of our war of resistance against Japan, selling gasoline and scrap iron to Japanese imperialism; nor would we doubt how the American imperialists poured gasoline all over the city with planes and destroyed the entire city with incendiary bombs when retreating from Yongdong in Korea. The American people have indeed invented many useful medicines, such as penicillin, but the American imperialists are even smarter and more vicious, putting or injecting poison into drinking water, rice, and even apples in Gimcheon, Korea. American sailors are famous "sea wolves," raping women everywhere. Fellow students! Would you still doubt the reports of naked female corpses found in American artillery positions and the corpses of Korean female students raped in American tanks? These beasts! These are the deeds of these beasts. In Cuba, the United States occupied the best naval port in the south, driving the Cuban residents to nearby small towns. Every morning and evening, they forced the Cuban people to do hard labor and degrading things by motorboat. The American military police thoroughly inspected them in and out, and they would rather throw an American cigarette into the sea than let a Cuban smoke it. Fellow students, this is the true face of the American rulers. Don't think that the batches of American relief supplies in Shanghai, the moldy milk powder, the spoiled cod liver oil, and the American cigarettes are so "benevolent." Look at their attitude towards the Cuban people, would you still want to smoke an American cigarette?

American soldiers, from colonels to privates, are all a bunch of beasts. When you see their lustful madness with your own eyes, your eyes will blaze with fire. Fellow students! I have said too much, but this is only one ten-thousandth of what they have done. We Jiaotong University students cannot sit idly by while the American beasts commit atrocities in our friendly neighbor Korea, and we Jiaotong University students must not let the American beasts break into our sacred motherland. Those who still have illusions about American imperialism, thinking they are civilized, it is time to wake up, it is time to be angry! Bring out the glorious tradition of our Jiaotong University students and go to the battlefield of the motherland!

　　美国是这样的物质文明！
    ——上海交大李保泓的控诉
    编者按：上海交通大学电信管理系四年级李保泓同学曾经在一九四四年在当时国民党反动派青年从军号召的欺骗下，到美国去受训。他是学习海军的雷达技术员。他把最近美帝在朝鲜的暴行，结合着他个人在美国受训时亲身的遭遇，证实了美国的疯狂行为是千真万确的。
    我愤怒，我不能再沉默了。我要把自己的经历和体验报道给同学们；让我们从对美帝的幻想中警醒过来，充分认识美帝的所谓“物质文明”。
    一九四四年，六年前的今天，当日寇铁蹄跨过了祖国广大的原野，沦陷了长沙、桂林、贵州独山，全国在兵慌马乱生死存亡的当儿，我们交大在重庆九龙坡掀起了从军的热潮。数百个同学参加了翻译、空军、陆军和海军。我那时读造船工程系二年级，和其余八十九个同学参加了海军，到美国去受训，我要把沿途和到达以后的情形告诉大家，看美帝的真面目是什么。
    出国前夕，在成都附近的新津机场，临上飞机时，美国人要我们在北风凛凛的腊月，脱光了裤子检查痔疮，不承认我们在重庆市立医院的检验证明书。在印度，美国人把我们从国内带去的东西全部烧光，浑身打ＤＤＴ，就像我们是从野人国里去的全身带有细菌。从孟买到美国的运输舰上，把我们一千多中国海军和黑人编在一个舱里，三千多人只准在后甲板上活动，和白色的美国人绝对隔离。过澳洲，不准我们在新金山登陆，因为澳洲是不让有色人种上岸的。在美受训的时候，美帝经常把我们当华工看待，给他们倒垃极桶、扫地、倒痰盂。有一次我愤怒地加以反抗，得到的是十五天关禁闭，关入牢狱，理由是“违抗命令”。他们始终没有把中国人当人。我们所接触到的一班美国海军，都是些没有脑筋的东西，他们只晓得女人和享乐，因为他们就是受到这样的教育，资本家麻痹了军人的头脑和良心，作为统治和奴役侵略的工具。在美国，我们的确看到了很多飞机机场、汽油库、船坞、钢铁厂，我们就不会怀疑我国抗战初期美国资本家怎样夺取这些劳动人民的成果，把汽油和废铁卖给日本帝国主义；更不会怀疑美帝在朝鲜永同撤退时用飞机将汽油浇遍全城以燃烧弹将整个城市毁灭。美国人民的确发明了很多有用药品，如盘尼西林，但美帝更会聪明而毒辣的，在朝鲜金泉的饮水、米谷甚至苹果中都放进了或注射了毒药。美国水手是出名的“海狼”，到处强奸妇女。同学们！你们还会怀疑报载在美国炮兵阵地中发现裸体的女尸，美国坦克中有朝鲜女学生被奸的尸体吗？这些野兽们！是这些野兽们干的。在古巴，美国侵占了南部最好的军港，把古巴的居民赶到附近的小城去。早晚用汽艇把古巴人民强迫来做苦工、做下贱的事情，进出必由美国宪兵周身检查，连一枝美国的香烟，宁愿丢在海里，也不让古巴人吸。同学们，这才是美国统治者的真面目。不要看到上海一批批的美国救济物资、发霉的奶粉、败坏的鱼肝油、美国香烟多么“仁慈”，看他们对待古巴人民的态度，你还想抽一枝美国烟吗？
    美国军人上自上校，下至小兵，全是一群野兽。当你亲眼看到他们的色狂，你的眼睛会冒出火来。同学们！我说得太多了，但这还是他们所做的千万分之一。我们交大人不能坐视着美国野兽在朝鲜友邦的暴行，我们交大人更不能让美国野兽闯入我们神圣的祖国。对美帝还存幻想的，以为他们是文明的，现在该是觉悟的时候了，是愤恨的时候了！拿出我们交大人光荣的传统，走上祖国的疆场上去！
