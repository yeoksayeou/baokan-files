Expose American Imperialist Atrocities, Recognize the Enemy's True Face
Beijing Tram Company Holds Accusation Meeting
All Employees Filled with Grief and Determination to Demand Blood Debt from American Imperialism

[Our Newspaper News] Reporter Pei Lan reports: The American imperialist aggression against Korea and Taiwan, and the continuous bombing of our Northeast, have aroused deep hatred among all employees of the Beijing Tram Company. On the 9th, 10th, and 11th of this month, several accusation meetings were held successively at the North Factory and the company, to accuse the atrocities of imperialism. At the accusation meeting attended by more than 200 people, workers resolutely stated: "American imperialism is attempting to rule us again; let them dream on. Today's China is not the China of twenty years ago. We must never let mad dogs bite us again." The workers recalled the days before liberation when imperialism ran rampant, and terror and darkness shrouded Beijing. Qin Bingyi said: "My home is in Suzhou Hutong, Dongdan. American soldiers would barge into the homes of good people in the middle of the night to find women, causing adults to cry and children to scream, making it impossible to have a peaceful day. One night, after 12 o'clock, American soldiers smashed my door. I called the military police before I dared to open the door. The two American soldiers were still shamelessly shouting for 'flower girls...' I wanted to punch them both in the face, but the military police stopped me. In the past, we workers lived like this, swallowing our anger." The workers, hearing this, said angrily: "As long as we are alive, there will be a day to avenge." Tram workers worked every day with a cold sweat, never knowing when they would be beaten to injury or death by those Japanese or American soldiers. The old worker Dou Jiechen, during the period of Japanese occupation, sold tickets on the tram. Because he didn't understand Japanese, he was once beaten severely by the Japanese devils and lay in bed for more than three months. His body has been crippled ever since. Now he can only do some light work. When Dou Jiechen recounted how he was brutally beaten by the Japanese devils, all the workers in the audience gnashed their teeth in hatred. Zhu Changxin said: "Once, I was riding my bicycle past the American Embassy in Dongjiaominxiang. An American soldier riding a foreign horse crossed the road and stepped on my bicycle. The bicycle was ruined, and I was thrown to the side. I got up and grabbed the American soldier, demanding compensation for the bicycle. At this time, Chiang Kai-shek's police stood on the side, watching the American soldier without daring to say a word. I was furious and grabbed the American soldier tightly. The American soldier said he would tie up his horse and come out to compensate me for the bicycle. Who knew he went inside and never came out again. At that time, who dared to go in to find him? I had to carry the broken bicycle home. As I walked, I thought to myself, why should Chinese people be subjected to the insults of American soldiers on Chinese soil! I thought, I must find a place to reason. But, comrades, under the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, where could we find a place to reason! I called the Seventh Branch and went to see them in person, but they ignored me. The matter ended like that. We were beaten and bullied, and we could only swallow it."

In 1944, only one tram often ran in Beijing during the day, and most of the workers were unemployed. After He Defu lost his job, he had no way to live, so he had to leave his eighty-year-old mother and take his two motherless children and flee. Recalling the scene at that time, he said painfully: "Where can I go? Where is my home?" These words touched the hidden pain in the workers' hearts. In an instant, all the workers in the audience wept. Ticket seller Liu Huiying, with red eyes, emerged from the crowd and shouted loudly: "I want to tell everyone about the pain I experienced personally." She said: "When the Japanese devils were here, they arrested soldiers everywhere and forced my uncle to leave. My grandmother said a few angry words and was stabbed to death by the Japanese devils with bayonets. My little sister cried and called for grandma, and the Japanese devils picked up the blood-stained bayonet and stabbed my sister to death. At that time, my parents took me and hid in my grandmother's house. Soon, the Japanese devils came to my grandmother's house looking for the Eighth Route Army. My grandmother said she didn't know, and she was also beaten to death by the Japanese devils." At this time, there was a sound of weeping throughout the audience. The workers wiped away their tears and said resolutely: "We will repay blood debts with blood. We must turn grief into strength." "Work harder and do our work well." Old worker Zhang Shirong, who is over fifty years old, said: "I can't do other work. I've been firing boilers all my life, and I'm pretty good at it. If the motherland needs it, I can go to the ships to stoke the fire." He donated fifty catties of millet to support the Korean people's war of liberation. Wang Keyi said: "After the liberation of Beijing, my son joined the People's Liberation Army. Now I am alone and earn three or four hundred catties of millet a month. After deducting my own expenses, I will contribute all of it to the Korean people." Dou Jiechen said: "I am old and crippled. I will let my son join the Volunteer Army and avenge me!"

　　揭露美帝暴行认清敌人面目
    京电车公司举行控诉会           
    全场职工悲愤填胸决向美帝讨还血债
    【本报讯】记者培蓝报道：美帝国主义侵略朝鲜、台湾，并连续轰炸我东北的事实，激起了北京电车公司全体职工的深切痛恨，本月九、十、十一三天，在北厂、公司接连召开了几次控诉会，控诉帝国主义的暴行。在二百多人的控诉会上，工人们坚决表示：“美帝国主义企图再来统治我们，让他作梦去吧，今天的中国不是二十年前的中国了，决不能再让疯狗来咬我们。”工人们回忆起解放以前的日子，那时候帝国主义任意横行，恐怖与黑暗笼罩着北京。秦秉毅说：“我家住在东单苏州胡同，美国兵深更半夜，在那里冲进善良人家找女人，闹得大人哭小孩叫，成天不得安宁。一天夜里，十二点多了，美国兵砸我家的门。我打电话找来宪兵，才敢出去开门。两个美国兵还在那里无耻的叫喊着找‘花姑娘……’我想上去揍他两个耳光，被宪兵拦住了。过去，我们工人就这样忍气吞声的活着。”工人们听到这里，激愤的说：“只要活着，总有报仇的一天。”电车工人每天捏着一把冷汗工作，说不定何时会被那些日本兵或者是美国兵打伤打死。老工人窦杰臣，在日寇统治时期，在电车上售票。因为不懂日本话，有一次竟被鬼子痛打一场，躺了三个多月不能起床。他的身体从此残废了。现在只能作些轻便活。当窦杰臣诉说他被鬼子毒打的情形时，全场工人无不切齿痛恨。朱长欣说：“有一次，我骑着车子经过东交民巷美国大使馆门前，一个美国兵骑着洋马，横跨马路，踏在我的车上。车子被踏坏了，我被摔到一边。我起来抓住美国兵，要他赔车子。这时候，蒋介石的警察站在一边，看着美国兵，不敢说话。我气极了，抓住美国兵不放。美国兵说他拴好马后出来赔我车子。谁知他进了门再不出来了。那时候谁敢进去找他，只得扛着破车回了家。我一边走一边想，中国人在中国的土地上，为什么要受美国兵的侮辱！我想，我要找个说理的地方。可是，同志们，在国民党反动派统治下，那里有我们说理的地方呀！我给七分局打电话，又亲自去找他们，他们毫不理睬。事情就这样完了。我们挨打受气，只能咽到肚里。”
    一九四四年，北京全市白天常常只跑一辆电车，工人大部失业。何德福失业后无法生活，只得丢下八十岁的老母亲，带着两个没有妈妈的孩子，逃亡出去。他回忆着当时的情景，沉痛的说：“我到什么地方去，那里有我的家呢？”这句话触动了工人们埋藏在心中的隐痛，刹那间，全场工人都哭了。售票员刘惠英两眼红红的，从人群里钻出来，大声喊着：“我要把我亲身体验的痛苦告诉大家。她说：“鬼子在时，到处抓兵，逼走了我叔父，我祖母说了几句气愤话，就被日本鬼子用刺刀刺死了，小妹妹哭着叫奶奶，鬼子又拿起那鲜血未干的刺刀，扎死了妹妹。那时我父母亲带着我躲到外祖母家里，不久，鬼子到外祖母家找八路军，外祖母说不知道，也叫鬼子打死了。”这时全场一片哭声。工人们擦干眼泪，坚毅的说：“血债要用血来还，我们要把悲痛变成力量。”“加倍努力，把工作作好。”五十多岁的老工友张世荣说：“别的工作我作不了，我烧了一辈子锅炉，烧得很不错。如果祖国需要，我可以去轮船上烧火去。”他捐出五十斤小米，援助朝鲜人民解放战争。王克义说：“北京解放后，我儿子就参加了人民解放军，我现在一个人，每月赚三、四百斤小米，除去我一个人的费用，全部贡献给朝鲜人民。”窦杰臣说：“我老了残废了，叫我儿子参加志愿军，替我报仇去！”
