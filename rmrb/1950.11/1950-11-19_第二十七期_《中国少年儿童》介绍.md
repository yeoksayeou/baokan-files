Issue 27
   Introduction to "Chinese Children"

    The 27th issue of "Chinese Children" has been published. To commemorate Comrade Ren Bishi, Honorary Chairman of the Communist Youth League, two articles are published. One is "Learning from Comrade Ren Bishi's Great Revolutionary Spirit" and the other is "Uncle Ren Bishi." From these two articles, children can see Comrade Ren Bishi's great spirit of devoting his life to the revolutionary cause and his kind and approachable revolutionary style of hard work and simplicity in daily life. Because American imperialism has invaded Korea and is approaching the gate of our motherland, the people across the country have launched a struggle to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend our country. This issue specifically publishes a letter from the Northeast, which vividly describes the hatred of the youth and children of the Northeast for American imperialism and their determination to defend their hometowns. Other main contents include Feng Xuefeng's "Lu Xun and His Childhood Friends," which writes about Lu Xun's childhood friendship with Runtu, the son of a farmer. Runtu told him a lot of knowledge he had never heard of, such as catching birds, collecting shells, and watching watermelons. Lu Xun liked this friend who grew up in a working people's family very much. Comrade Xiao Yemu introduces a good book to the children this time - Qin Zhaoyang's "The Story of the Little Swallow's Flight for Thousands of Miles." This article is written in the form of a story and is very interesting. Children will want to read that book after reading this introduction. In addition, there is a fairy tale translated by Luo Fu: "The Blind Horse," a comic strip co-painted by Miao Di and Gao Zongying: "Axi Tribe's Machine Gunner Wu Tiancai," and the two columns "Team Life" and "Everyone Writes" also have many good articles. Every article in the entire issue has illustrations.

   《中国少年儿童》介绍
    《中国少年儿童》第二十七期已出版。为了追悼青年团名誉主席任弼时同志，刊载了两篇文章。一篇是《学习任弼时伯伯的伟大革命精神》一篇是《任弼时伯伯》。从这两篇文章里，小朋友们可以看到任弼时伯伯毕生尽力于革命事业的伟大精神与日常生活中和蔼可亲与艰苦朴素的革命作风。由于美帝侵略朝鲜并且逼近了祖国的大门，全国人民都掀起了抗美援朝保家卫国的斗争，本期特发表了东北寄来的一封信，信里面生动的写出东北青年和少年儿童对美帝的仇恨，各保卫家乡的决心。其他主要内容，还有冯雪峰先生写的《鲁迅和他少年时代的朋友》写鲁迅少年时代和一个农民的儿子闰土做了朋友，闰土告诉他很多从来没有听过的知识，如捉鸟、捡贝壳、看西瓜等，鲁迅非常喜欢这个生长在劳动人民家里的朋友。萧也牧同志这次给小朋友介绍一本好书——秦兆阳的《小燕子万里飞行记》，这篇文章是用故事形式写的，写得非常有趣，小朋友看了这篇介绍，一定会想看那本书。此外还有罗敷先生译的童话：《瞎马》，苗地高宗英合画的连环画：《阿西族的机枪手武天才》、《队的生活》和《大家都来写》两栏也有很多好的文章，全期每篇文章都有插图。
