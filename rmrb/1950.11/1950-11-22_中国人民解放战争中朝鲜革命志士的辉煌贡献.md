　　Countless Korean patriots shed their blood in the Chinese People's War of Liberation, thereby providing glorious contributions to the victory of the Chinese People's revolutionary cause.

　　In the Chinese People's Liberation Army, some companies were entirely composed of Korean patriots. The Jin Chengfan Model Company of a certain unit was such a company. They were Korean farmers in the Wangqing area of Jilin Province, Northeast China, who had long been oppressed by Japanese invaders and feudal landlords. After the "August 15th" liberation of Northeast China by the Soviet Red Army, they automatically formed a team to defend their hometown. After this team was reorganized into a local force company in 1946, it won several victories in bandit suppression battles. In the battle of Four-Room Raid on March 7, 1947, they fought against the American-equipped regular army of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits for the first time, killing and wounding more than 30 bandit soldiers and capturing six prisoners. In the winter of the same year, in the battle of raiding the East Changchun Station, they accepted the task of capturing the enemy's last fortified bunker within ten minutes, but they captured it in only eight minutes, and captured more than 70 Chiang Kai-shek bandits. The victory of this battle earned the company the title of "Combat Model Company" and the "Fierce Attack and Charge" banner. In the early spring of the following year, the company was incorporated into the main force and then participated in the battle of Wumatun. They once again displayed their brave and swift fighting style, defeating a battalion of the main force of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits' 60th Army. The entire company collectively performed great meritorious service and was once again awarded the title of "Combat Model Company" by the entire division. In the white-blade battle at Gudian in February of the same year, the combat hero, the famous sharpshooter Zheng Henglian, refused to leave the front line after being seriously injured, and single-handedly repelled five enemy charges with a light machine gun, killing more than 50 enemies. People's Hero Martyr Wu Longzhen was wounded twice but refused to leave the front line. Before he sacrificed himself, he was still holding his weapon tightly and shouting: "Long live the Chinese Communist Party!" In total, the company excellently completed its combat missions in more than 30 battles, capturing 331 enemies and seizing many guns, artillery, and ammunition.

　　Another all-round model company composed of Korean patriots was also organized in Wangqing, Jilin Province, after "August 15th". In their participation in the battles of Changchun, Tieling, Tanggu, Machitang, Longhui, etc., and in the performance of training and other tasks, they won eight award banners, and 46 members of the company were awarded the title of meritorious heroes.

　　A certain engineering company composed of Korean patriots braved the enemy's artillery fire to build a pontoon bridge in the icy water during the Tianjin Liberation Campaign, ensuring the rapid advance of our attacking troops' tanks and artillery. The company was therefore awarded the "Bridge-Building Hero Company" banner. After the liberation of Tianjin, the company also excellently completed the task of clearing landmines, ensuring the safety of the citizens of Tianjin. In participating in the bridge repair project on a certain section of the Hankou-Huangpi highway, the company also completed the task ahead of schedule in continuous rain and vast water, and was therefore commended by the Wuhan Military Control Commission.

　　There are too many Korean male and female comrades who have performed meritorious service in combat and work to list. For example, Yuan Riheng, who attended the first National Youth Congress of China, was a specially meritorious combat hero; combat hero Jin Fuxing had performed eight major meritorious services and two minor meritorious services in the battles of Siping, Xinlitun, Western Liaoning, Tianjin, and other battles; Park Guoji was a specially meritorious hero who won the "Mao Zedong Medal"; Park Longyun was a meritorious hero who won the "Zhu De Medal" and performed eight major meritorious services, and Jin Shiyan and Shi Zailong were also meritorious heroes who had performed eight major meritorious services; Jin Tiande showed bravery and resourcefulness in more than 40 battles of all sizes and was awarded the title of First-Class People's Hero. In the Hengbao campaign, specially meritorious hero Cui Renshun bravely seized the boats looted by Huang Jie's bandit troops. He swam across a river 170 meters wide and was the first to recapture the enemy's wooden boats, enabling the assault team to quickly cross the river and wipe out the enemy. Liu Xixie, the "Model of Policy and Discipline" and a meritorious hero who performed five major meritorious services, has carried more than 15,000 loads of water, cut more than 300 bundles of grass, and repaired houses more than 40 times for the people in the past three years. Dr. Park Qilong has always cared for the wounded, and he himself has transfused more than 1,500 cc of blood for the wounded. Nurses Li Shunren and Jin Shuming have both performed great meritorious services and were praised as "Model Nurses." Comrade Li Shunren was also awarded the glorious title of First-Class People's Hero.

　　中国人民解放战争中朝鲜革命志士的辉煌贡献
    无数朝鲜志士在中国人民解放战争中流洒了自己的热血，从而对中国人民革命事业的胜利，提供了辉煌的贡献。
    中国人民解放军的部队中，有些连队完全是由朝鲜志士所组成的。某部模范连队——金成范连就是这样一个连队。他们是东北吉林省汪清一带长期在日寇和封建地主压榨下的朝鲜农民，在“八一五”苏联红军解放东北以后，他们自动组成了一支保卫家乡的队伍。这支队伍在一九四六年编组成地方部队的连队后，连续获得了多次剿匪战斗的胜利。一九四七年三月七日奔袭四间房的战斗中，他们第一次与蒋匪军的美式装备正规军作战，毙伤匪军三十多人，还捉了六个俘虏。同年冬季，该连在奔袭长春东站的战斗中，接受了在十分钟内夺下敌人最后一个强固地堡的任务，可是他们只用八分钟就夺下来了，并且俘掳了七十多个蒋匪军。这一战斗的胜利，使该连荣膺“战斗模范连”的称号，并获得“猛打猛冲”的奖旗。第二年初春，该连编入主力部队，接着参加五马屯战斗，他们又一次发挥了勇猛迅速的战斗作风，打垮了蒋匪主力六十军的一个营，全连集体立了大功，再膺全师“战斗模范连”的称号。在同年二月间孤店的白刃搏斗中，战斗英雄、著名的射击手郑亨连，负了重伤之后还不肯下火线，一个人以轻机枪击溃敌人的五次冲锋，毙敌五十余名。人民英雄吴龙镇烈士，两次受伤不下火线。他临牺牲时，手中还紧握着武器高呼：“中国共产党万岁！”总计该连在三十多次作战中，都卓越地完成了战斗任务，并俘敌三百三十一名，缴获枪炮和弹药很多。
    另一个由朝鲜志士组成的全面模范连队也是在“八一五”后在吉林省汪清组织起来的。他们在参加长春、铁岭、塘沽、马池塘、隆回等历次战斗中，在执行练兵等任务中，曾荣获奖旗八面，全连有四十六人荣膺大功功臣。
    由朝鲜志士组成的某工兵连队在解放天津战役中，曾冒着敌人炮火网，在冰冷的水中架设浮桥，保证了我攻击部队的坦克、炮兵迅速前进。该连因此荣获“架桥英雄连”的奖旗。天津解放后，该连又出色地完成了清扫地雷的任务，保证了天津市民的安全。在参加抢修汉口至黄陂公路某桥梁工程中，该连也在阴雨连绵和汪洋大水中提前完成了任务，因此获得武汉市军管会的通令嘉奖。
    朝鲜男女同志在战斗和工作中立功的多得不胜枚举。例如曾出席中国首届全国青年代表大会的元日亨就是特等战斗英雄；战斗英雄金福星曾在四平、新立屯、辽西、天津等各次战役中立了八大功、二小功；朴国济是荣获“毛泽东奖章”的特等功臣；朴龙云是荣获“朱德奖章”的立了八大功的功臣，金石岩、石在龙二人也是立过八大功的功臣；金天德在大小四十多次战斗中表现勇敢、机智，荣获一级人民英雄称号。特等功臣崔仁顺在衡宝战役中，英勇地抢夺黄杰匪部劫逃的船只，他游过一百七十公尺宽的江面，头一名抢回敌人木船，使突击组能够迅速渡江歼灭敌人。“政策纪律模范”、立了五大功的功臣柳喜燮三年来，替老百姓挑水一万五千多担、割草三百多捆、修房四十多次。朴奇龙医师，一贯爱护伤员，他自己先后为伤员输血一千五百多西西。女护士李顺任、金淑明都立过大功，被誉为“模范护士”，李顺任同志还得到了一级人民英雄的光荣称号。
