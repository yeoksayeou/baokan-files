Xinhua News Agency, October 31st: Japanese police, armed by the American occupation forces, are brutally suppressing workers protesting the unwarranted dismissal of progressive employees. According to a Reuters dispatch from Tokyo, Japanese workers gathered at the "Denryoku-sha" (note: company name) electric motor factory on the 27th to protest the company's layoff of 22 workers. The reactionary authorities even dispatched 260 police officers to suppress them, shooting and wounding one union leader. According to International News Service, workers laid off by "Higashi-Nippon Heavy Industries," which is producing military supplies for the U.S. military, repeatedly held protest demonstrations in front of the company's gates despite constant police suppression. As a result, 25 workers have been arrested. The company is now heavily guarded by Japanese sentries hired by the U.S. Army. At Tsudanuma Station in Chiba Prefecture, police also beat and arrested demonstrators protesting layoffs and persecution. Two people were injured and 26 were arrested, including Ren'i, a member of the Chiba Prefecture Committee of the Japanese Communist Party.

According to a Kyodo News report, the Yoshida reactionary government's Ministry of Labor received information as of the 25th that private coal mines, railways, metal mines, chemicals, shipbuilding, steel, and petroleum companies alone have recently laid off more than 4,000 employees. Automobile, printing, vehicle and other companies are also preparing to take similar measures of persecution in the coming days.

    【新华社三十一日讯】由美国占领军所武装的日本警察，凶暴地镇压抗议无理解雇进步职工的工人。据路透社东京讯：日本工人二十七日在“电业社”（按系公司名称）的电气发动机工厂集会，抗议该公司解雇工人二十二名。反动当局竟出动二百六十名警察进行弹压，枪伤工会领袖一人。另据国际新闻社讯，正替美军从事军需生产的“东日本重工业公司”所解雇的工人，不顾警察不断的镇压，曾多次在该公司门前举行抗议示威。因此而被捕的工人，先后已达二十五人。该公司已由美国陆军所雇的日本哨兵严密防卫。在千叶县津田沼车站，警察也曾殴捕抗议解雇迫害的示威者。有两人受伤，二十六人被捕，被捕者包括日本共产党千叶县委员会委员仁井。
    又据共同社消息，据吉田反动政府劳工省截至二十五日为止所接到的情报，仅私营的煤矿、铁道、金属矿山、化学、造船、钢铁、石油各企业部门，最近就解雇职工四千名以上。汽车、印刷、车辆等企业，也准备在日内采取同类迫害措施。
