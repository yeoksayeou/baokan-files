　　In Memory of Comrade Ren Bishi
    He Long

　　The tragic news of Comrade Ren Bishi's passing fills me with immense sorrow and grief! I grieve that the Chinese people have lost a great warrior, a brilliant leader, and a great statesman. I grieve that I have lost a beloved comrade-in-arms, with whom I shared hardships in the struggle for people's liberation, and a most intimate comrade. For thirty years, Comrade Bishi dedicated all his energy to the great revolutionary cause of Chinese national liberation, people's liberation, and the liberation of the working class, establishing indelible achievements and setting a model of revolutionary struggle for us Communist Party members, revolutionary soldiers, and patriotic people. Comrade Bishi has departed from us forever, but his spirit will forever live in the hearts of the Chinese Communist Party members and the Chinese people.

　　My first meeting with Comrade Bishi, which led to our close comradeship, occurred during the most arduous years of the people's liberation struggle, in October 1934, during the Land Revolution War. At that time, Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang, with superior forces, attacked our revolutionary base in the Hunan-Hubei-Sichuan-Guizhou region, blocking our contact with the Party Central Committee and other revolutionary base areas. It was then that the Sixth Army Corps, led by Comrade Bishi and others, victoriously joined forces with our Second Army Corps. The merger of the two army corps, especially the arrival of Comrade Bishi, filled us with boundless excitement and strength. From then on, we restored contact with the Party Central Committee, bringing us the valuable experience of the Central Red Army's struggle, enabling us to resolve many significant policy issues. This allowed the construction of the Hunan-Hubei-Sichuan-Guizhou revolutionary base and the building of the troops to advance on a more sound path. The ideological leadership, political work, and military work construction of the troops became more robust, the mass movement became more active, and the revolutionary base area rapidly expanded. Precisely because of this, the number of reactionary troops of Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang annihilated or suffering annihilating blows increased daily. Also, due to the greater strength of our troops, even when the enemy outnumbered us by more than ten times, they could not stop this people's army from advancing towards its goals during the start of the Long March and during the Long March itself. Instead, we struck the enemy and strengthened ourselves in the process. All these achievements are inextricably linked to Comrade Bishi's leadership and his arduous and in-depth work. On the road forward, we overcame the obstruction of Chiang's bandit gang. Just as we were rapidly and victoriously joining forces with the Fourth Front Army in Ganzi in June 1936, we encountered the sabotage activities of the traitor Zhang Guotao, who was plotting to split the Party and the Red Army. Comrade Bishi led the cadres of the Second Front Army in an irreconcilable struggle against the traitor Zhang Guotao, crushing his plot, uniting these two people's armies, and ultimately enabling the First, Second, Third, and Fourth Front Armies to victoriously join forces in Shaanxi-Gansu.

　　Comrade Bishi had boundless loyalty to the cause of the Party and the people, working hard for thirty years as if it were one day. He possessed Bolshevist high principles, noble Communist qualities, and excellent work style. All this sets an example of struggle and action for us Communist Party members and revolutionary soldiers, which we should always learn from.

　　Comrade Bishi was one of Chairman Mao's closest comrades-in-arms and one of the best leaders of the Chinese people and the People's Liberation Army. The loss of Comrade Bishi is incalculable. To make up for this loss, I call on all commanders and fighters of the Southwest Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army to make a hundredfold effort to build a strong national defense force, consolidate our national defense, defend the construction cause of the people's motherland, oppose the aggressive war of US imperialism, and safeguard world peace, in order to complete the great revolutionary cause that Comrade Bishi strived for throughout his life.

　　悼任弼时同志
    贺龙
    任弼时同志逝世的噩耗传来后，使我万分的沉痛和悲哀！哀痛我们中国人民从此失去了一位伟大的战士、英明的领导者和伟大的政治家，哀痛我从此失去了一位人民解放斗争中同艰苦共患难的敬爱的战友和最亲密的同志。弼时同志三十年来为中国民族解放、人民解放和工人阶级解放的伟大革命事业已贡献了全部精力，建立了不可磨灭的功绩，为我们共产党人革命战士爱国人民树立了革命斗争的楷模。弼时同志从此与我们永诀了，但他的精神将永远活在中国共产党人和中国人民的心里。
    我和弼时同志开始见面并成为亲密的战友，是在人民解放斗争最艰苦的岁月里，即一九三四年十月，土地革命战争时期，当时蒋介石匪帮以优势的兵力进攻我们湘鄂川黔的革命根据地，阻梗了我们和党中央的联系，阻梗了我们和其他革命根据地的联系，正在这时，弼时同志等所率领的六军团与我们二军团胜利会合了。由于两个军团的会合，特别是弼时同志的到来，给我们以无限的兴奋和力量，从此使我们恢复了和党中央的联系，给我们带来了中央红军斗争的宝贵经验，使我们对许多重大的政策问题获得了解决，从而使湘鄂川黔革命根据地的建设和部队建设在更加健全的道路上向前发展，部队的思想领导、政治工作，以及军事工作建设更加健全了，群众运动更加开展了，革命根据地迅速扩大了。正因为如此，蒋介石匪帮的反动军队，被歼和受到歼灭性打击的数量日益增多了。也正由于我们部队的更加坚强，使我们在长征开始和长征时期，那怕敌人以超过于我们十数倍的力量，并不能阻止这支人民军队按照它的目标前进，而且在前进中打击了敌人，壮大了自身。这一切成就都是与弼时同志的领导及其坚苦深入的工作密切不可分离的。在前进的路上，我们战胜了蒋匪帮的阻挠，正当一九三六年六月在甘孜与四方面军胜利地急快地会师时，又遇到叛徒张国焘阴谋分裂党和红军的破坏活动，弼时同志领导着二方面军干部，和叛徒张国焘进行了不调和的斗争，粉碎了他的阴谋，团结了这两支人民军队，使一、二、三四个方面军终于在陕甘胜利会师。
    弼时同志对党和人民的事业具有无限的忠心，艰苦奋斗，三十年如一日，他具有布尔塞维克的高度原则性，崇高的共产党人的品质，和优良作风，这一切给我们共产党人和革命战士所树立的斗争和行动的榜样，是我们应当永远学习的。
    弼时同志是毛主席最亲近的战友之一，中国人民和人民解放军最好的领导者之一，弼时同志的逝世给我们的损失是不可估量的。为弥补这种损失，我号召中国人民解放军西南军区部队全体指战员，以百倍努力来建设强大的国防军，巩固我们的国防，保卫人民祖国的建设事业，反对美帝国主义的侵略战争，维护世界和平，来完成弼时同志所毕生奋斗的伟大革命事业。
