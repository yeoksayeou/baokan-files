　　Northeast Industrial and Mining Enterprise Workers Show Great Enthusiasm
    Patriotic Production Competition Widely Unfolded
    Strengthen Organizational Leadership to Make the Movement More In-depth
    [Reported by this newspaper] According to the Northeast Daily: The patriotic labor competition has been fully launched in all industrial and mining enterprises in Northeast China.

    Competition Achievements in Twenty Days: Nearly 700,000 workers in 670 factories, mines, and enterprises participated in the movement.
    When the flames of aggression ignited by American imperialism in Korea threatened our country's security, all workers in Northeast China unanimously expressed their determination to intensify production with practical actions to defend economic construction, defend a good life, and defend the security of the motherland. After Zhao Guoyou, a lathe worker, issued a challenge to all workers in Northeast China on October 25th and the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions issued a call, the competition was widely launched. Under the promotion and leadership of trade unions at all levels, as of the 14th of this month, according to incomplete statistics for twenty days, in the industrial systems of each province (city), a total of 670 factories, mines, and enterprises with 693,000 workers participated in this heated labor competition movement. They demonstrated unparalleled labor enthusiasm and a high degree of wisdom, enabling the movement to achieve great results from the very beginning.

    Zhao Guoyou, an advanced producer standing at the forefront of the competition movement, promoted the workers of the entire factory (Third Machinery Factory) to complete the fourth quarter production tasks ahead of schedule in October and guaranteed quality. Workers in Andong City, standing on the frontier of the motherland, showed even more enthusiasm. The first-grade rubber shoes of the state-owned rubber factory reached 99.91% in October and further increased to 99.96% in November, while before August of this year, the state-stipulated quota of 95% had never been reached. A certain steel mill completed the annual task ahead of schedule and reduced defective products by 500 tons, accumulating more than 50 billion yuan (Northeast currency, same below) in wealth for the country. Shenyang Garment Factory No. 1 not only completed all tasks five days ahead of schedule but also tried to utilize every piece of scrap cloth to the maximum extent during cutting, saving 18,653 square feet of cloth. The 3005 locomotive crew of the Dunhua Locomotive Depot did not leave the locomotive for twelve days, adding coal and water themselves. When they couldn't catch up with meals, they burned soybeans and baked corn, finally completing the transportation task. Zhang Lan, a female worker at the Dalian Yumin Rubber Factory, put forward the slogan of "fighting to save one second." She hung her watch on the worktable, calculated working hours, and then tried to shorten the working hours. For example, to run the upper of a pair of shoes, it was necessary to stop the machine three times. She came up with the operating method of "running to the end in one stitch without stopping in the middle," reducing two stops. When sewing the front and back of the shoe, she came up with a continuous operation method, saving another ten seconds for each pair of shoes sewn. Because she seized every minute and second, she increased from sewing 60 pairs of shoes a day in the past to 360 pairs, increasing work efficiency by five times, and the quality also met the standards.

    The competition not only improved efficiency and product quality but also improved work a step further. For example, the No. 2 Nail Factory of the Machinery Bureau, based on the fact that the annual task had been completed, focused on establishing various systems to reduce costs. First, it established a material consumption system, changing the past phenomenon of no fixed quota for raw material consumption. Second, it established a safety and hygiene system and a mechanical storage responsibility system, reducing accidents. It also established a finished product inspection and storage system, reducing the waste rate of semi-finished products and the losses caused by rust and rot of finished products. At the same time, it established a daily evaluation form to check the implementation of the system. As a result, the actual cost was reduced by 7.52% compared to the first quarter. The trade union of Zhao Guoyou's lathe team in the Third Machinery Factory, in order to ensure the implementation of various responsibility systems, solved the specific difficulties in the implementation of the system. If individual workers did not implement it, slogans of criticism and advice were written in front of his lathe. After he corrected it, the slogans of praise were immediately replaced. This made every worker develop the habit of implementing the system. In October, not only was the output completed, but not a single defective product was produced.

    Four Major Characteristics of the Movement: The political goals of the competition are clear, the conditions are specific and the content is rich, the vast majority of workers participate, and model workers play a central role.

    This movement also exhibits the following characteristics:

    First, it is closely integrated with the current situation, and the political goals of the competition are very clear. Trade unions at all levels and factories and mines have organized current affairs education and learning, which has enabled all workers to have a deep understanding of this movement. The Shenyang Federation of Trade Unions organized responsible cadres from the Propaganda Department of the Northeast Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions, the Propaganda Department of the Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, and the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions to go deep into various factories to explain current affairs. 73,000 workers participated in the lectures, accounting for one-third of the city's workers. In addition to regular education, various factories and mines further deepened workers' understanding of the current situation through forms such as advanced producer representative meetings (such as Fushun Coal Mine and Railway) and worker representative meetings (such as smelters). Before carrying out current affairs education and learning, due to the rumors and sabotage of bandits and special agents, the workers' morale was unstable, and some even asked for leave and did not return, worked passively, or ate and drank excessively. But after education and learning, these phenomena were quickly corrected. For example, in early October, the first-grade products of Rubber Factory No. 7 were 94.89%. After conducting a current affairs report in mid-October, it increased to 99.9%. The chemical department of a certain steel enterprise had an attendance rate of 90% before the study. The day after the report, it increased to 93%, and then to 95%, exceeding previous records.

    Second, in the competition guarantee conditions of all factories, mines, enterprises, workshops, groups, and individuals, the common proposal of adhering to production, guaranteeing attendance rate, and strengthening four-prevention work made the competition more rich in content. For example, Wang Jingbin, a telephone operator at the Andong Railway Telephone Station, insisted on his post during the first air raid by enemy planes, ensuring smooth telephone communication during the tense situation, even though other workers went to hide. Party members and members of the Communist Youth League of the Andong City Telephone Bureau took the lead in sticking to their posts during air raids. Workers in various factories and mines automatically organized factory protection teams and safety teams to protect factories. According to statistics from 55 factories in Shenyang, 1,103 safety teams have been organized with 7,059 workers participating. They often come early and leave late, inspecting machinery and equipment, fire-fighting equipment, and various safety equipment to prevent sabotage by bad elements. In October, no thefts occurred in 277 factories in Shenyang. Of the 105 theft cases solved by public security organs, 57 were reported by workers.

    Third, the extent of the movement is unprecedented in past competitions. The competition is not only being carried out in public enterprises but also in private enterprises. Not only workers participate, but also technicians, staff, doctors, nurses, canteen workers, nursery staff, and even workers' family members are all involved in the movement. Sixty percent of staff in Shenyang City participated in the competition. Technicians from the Fushun Mining Bureau issued a challenge to technicians throughout Northeast China. The engineer who manufactured grinding wheels at the Grinding Wheel Factory of the Machinery Bureau actively completed the long-studied method of manufacturing emery, creating 20 billion yuan in wealth for the country.

    Fourth, labor models and advanced producers promote the movement forward. Zhao Guoyou first ignited the flames of the competition movement, and other representatives attending the National Labor Model Representative Conference spread this flame widely. After seeing Zhao Guoyou's challenge news, Meng Tai immediately promoted 34 factories and mines to join the competition. National labor model representatives from the coal mine system jointly conveyed the situation of the conference to various mines in northern Manchuria in rotation. When they arrived at a mine, the competition movement in that mine immediately launched vigorously. Liu Maoyou, a labor model at Dalian Yuandian Glass Factory, put forward a rationalization proposal in the competition, extending the life of the large kiln by four months, which not only guaranteed this year's production tasks but also ensured that the tasks of the first quarter of next year would not be affected. Zhao Dehui, a labor model worker in a private enterprise, and Li Jingmin, a model doctor, challenged workers and medical staff in private enterprises, respectively, making the scale of the movement even more extensive. They all kept in mind Chairman Mao's instructions to play a leading, backbone, and bridging role, and answered with practical actions, which made this competition movement have a core, mobilizing and uniting more workers to participate.

    Reasons for Achieving Results: Trade union cadres at all levels go deep into production to unite with technicians and do a good job in the work of workers' families.

    The achievements of this competition movement are inseparable from the efforts of trade union cadres at all levels. After the industrial conference and the Second Expanded Plenary Session of the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions, they began to change the past style of doing trade union work outside of production, and went deep into the production process to discover and solve problems. The Production Department of the Anshan Federation of Trade Unions established a telephone and oral reporting system to promptly understand the situation and solve problems, so that the movement remains full of energy. For example, if problems were seen from the attendance rate, they would promptly propose to the Department of Culture and Education to strengthen propaganda and education work. If problems were found in the organization, they would put forward opinions to the Organization Department, so that the work of various departments revolves around the competition. A high engineer at the Heavy Machinery Factory of a certain steel enterprise proposed a plan to increase output and improve quality, but it was not accepted by the workers. The trade union cooperated with the Party and the administration to educate the workers. After the workers accepted and implemented it, the number of times the steel plate was pressed was reduced from 21 to 17, and the phenomenon of uneven thickness of the steel plate was eliminated, and the factory won a national bonus of 200 million yuan because of this. This greatly strengthened the unity of workers and technicians and provided technical guidance for the production competition. Before the copper furnace scrap competition in the Machinery Repair Factory was 65%, in mid-October, the factory trade union sent an organizational member to help solve the problem. By the end of the month, the scrap rate was reduced to 30%. The trade union organized lathe workers to write congratulatory letters to consolidate the achievements. Trade unions in railways, coal mines, and other factories and mines have carried out the work of workers' families, so that workers can concentrate on participating in the competition without being affected by family life and their wives holding them back.

    At present, the movement has been fully and widely launched, but there are still many problems in organizational leadership that need to be resolved in order to make the movement continue to deepen. To this end, the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions convened a joint meeting of production ministers of the trade unions of each province and city on the 15th of this month to summarize the experiences and lessons of the competition.

　　东北工矿企业职工热情高涨
    爱国主义生产竞赛广泛展开   
    加强组织领导使运动更加深入
    【本报讯】据东北日报消息：爱国主义的劳动竞赛，已在全东北工矿企业中全面展开。
    二十天内竞赛成绩：共六七○个厂矿及企业单位的职工近七十万人卷入了运动
    当美帝国主义在朝鲜点燃起的侵略战火威胁到我国的安全时，东北全体职工即一致表示以加紧生产的实际行动，保卫经济建设，保卫美好的生活，保卫祖国的安全。及至十月二十五日赵国有车工部向全东北职工提出挑战及东北总工会发出号召之后，竞赛即广泛展开，在各级工会的推动领导之下，截至本月十四日二十天的不完全统计，在各省（市）产业系统中，共有六百七十个厂矿及企业单位的职工六十九万三千人卷入这一火热的劳动竞赛运动。他们发挥了无比的劳动热情与高度的智慧，使运动一开始即获得了很大成绩。
    站在竞赛运动最前面的先进生产者赵国有，推动全厂（第三机械厂）职工，于十月份提前完成第四季度的生产任务，并保证了质量。屹立在祖国边疆的安东市工人，表现得更为积极。国营橡胶厂一级品胶鞋，十月份达到百分之九十九·九一，十一月又提高到百分之九十九·九六，而今年八月份以前，一直未达到国家规定的百分之九十五的定额。某炼钢厂提前完成全年任务、并减少废品五百吨，为国家积累财富五百余亿元（东北币，下同）。沈阳被服一厂，不仅提前五天完成全部任务，在裁剪时，更尽量把每一块碎布利用到最大限度，节省布一万八千六百五十三平方尺。敦化机务段三○○五号机车包乘组，十二天没有离开机车，自己上煤上水，赶不上吃饭时，就烧黄豆、烤苞米吃，终于完成运输任务。大连裕民胶皮工厂女工张兰，提出：“为节省一秒钟而斗争”的口号，自己把表挂在工作台上，计算工时，然后设法缩短工时。如跑一双鞋面，需停三次车，她就想出“一针跑到底中间不停车”的操作方法，减少两次停车时间；在缝连鞋前头与后帮时，她又想法创出连续操作法，每缝连一双鞋又节省了十秒钟。正因为她抓紧一分一秒的时间，从过去每天缝连六十双鞋提高到三百六十双，使工作效率提高了五倍，质量也都合乎规格。
    竞赛不仅使效率提高、产品质量有所改进，更使工作也提高了一步。如机械局制钉二厂根据全年任务已经完成的情况，着重建立各种制度降低成本，首先建立了材料消耗制，改变了过去消耗原材料无定额的现象。其次，建立了安全卫生制及机械保管责任制，减少事故，又建立了成品检查及保管制度，减少了半成品的废品率，及成品因生锈腐烂造成的损失，同时，又建立了日评表，检查执行制度的情况，结果使实际成本比第一季度降低百分之七·五二。第三机械厂赵国有车工部工会，为使各种责任制得以贯彻，解决了执行制度中的具体困难，个别工人不执行，则在他的车床前写上批评劝告的标语。他改正后，马上就换上表扬的标语。使每一个工人养成了执行制度的习惯。十月份不仅完成了产量，而且未出一件废品。
    运动的四大特点：竞赛政治目标明确，条件具体内容丰富，广大职工普遍参加，劳模起了核心作用。
    这一运动还表现下列几个特点：
    首先是与当前形势密切结合，竞赛的政治目标非常明确。各级工会与各厂矿均组织了时事教育与学习，使得全体职工对于这一运动有了深刻的认识。沈阳市总工会组织了中共中央东北局宣传部、东北总工会、中共沈阳市委宣传部及市总工会的负责干部，深入各厂讲解时事，参加听讲的工人有七万三千人，占全市工人的三分之一。各厂矿除经常进行教育之外，更通过先进生产者代表会（如抚顺煤矿、铁路）、职工代表会（如冶炼厂）等形式，加深职工对时局的认识。在进行时事教育与学习之前，由于匪特分子的造谣破坏，职工情绪不稳，个别的甚至请假不归，工作消极或大吃大喝，但经过教育与学习之后，这些现象都迅速纠正。如橡胶七厂在十月上旬，一级产品为百分之九四·八九，中旬进行时事报告之后，即提高到百分之九九·九。某制钢企业化工部，学习前出勤率为百分之九十，报告后第二天即提高到百分之九三，以后又提到百分之九十五，超过以往的纪录。
    其次，在所有厂矿、企业单位、车间、小组及个人的竞赛保证条件中，都共同地提出坚持生产、保证出勤率、加强四防工作，使竞赛更具备了丰富的内容。如安东铁路电话所电话员王静宾，在敌机初次空袭时，虽然其他职工都去隐避，但他却坚持岗位，保证了紧张时电话的通畅。安东市电话局的党员、团员，在空袭时都带头坚持工作岗位。各厂矿工人都自动组织护厂队、安全小组保卫工厂，据沈阳市五十五个工厂的统计，已组织起一千一百○三个安全小组，七千○五十九名工人参加，他们经常早来晚走，检查机器设备、防火设备及各种安全设备，防止坏分子破坏。十月份，沈阳二百七十七个工厂没发生过一次盗案，公安机关破获的一百零五起盗案中，有五十七起是职工检举的。
    第三，运动的广泛性为过去历次竞赛所未有。竞赛不仅在公营企业中，在私营企业中也同样展开；不仅是工人参加，技术人员、职员、医生、护士、食堂工作者、托儿所保育人员甚至连职工家属都一齐卷入运动里来。沈阳市百分之六十的职员参加了竞赛；抚顺矿务局技术人员向全东北技术人员提出了挑战。机械局砂轮厂制造砂轮的工程师，积极完成钻研已久的金钢砂制造法，为国家创造财富二百亿元。
    第四，劳动模范与先进生产者推动运动前进。赵国有首先点燃起竞赛运动的火焰，其他出席全国劳模代表会议的代表就将这一火焰普遍燃烧起来。孟泰在看到赵国有挑战消息之后，立即推动起三十四个厂矿卷入竞赛。煤矿系统的全国劳模代表，共同到北满各矿山轮回传达大会情况。他们到了那个矿山，那个矿山的竞赛运动就马上轰轰烈烈地开展起来。大连远电玻璃厂劳模刘茂有，在竞赛中又提出合理化建议，延长大窑寿命四个月，不仅使今年生产任务有了保证，就是明年第一季的任务也不受影响。私营企业工人劳动模范赵德惠、模范医生李景民，分别向私营企业工人及医务人员挑战，使运动的规模更为广泛。他们都牢记着毛主席告诉他们的要起带头、骨干、桥梁作用的指示，并用实际行动来回答，使得此次竞赛运动有了核心，发动与团结更多的职工来参加。
    获得成绩原因：各级工会干部深入到生产中去团结技术人员，搞好工人家属工作。
    此次竞赛运动所以获得了成绩，是和各级工会干部的努力分不开的。他们在工业会议与东总第二届执委扩大会议之后，都开始转变过去站在生产之外搞工会工作的作风，深入到生产过程之中，发现与解决问题。鞍山市总工会生产部建立了电话与口头汇报制度，及时了解情况，解决问题，使运动保持饱满，如从出勤率看出问题，就及时向文教部提出，加强宣教工作，发现组织上有问题，就向组织部提出意见，使各部门工作都围绕着竞赛。某炼钢企业重机厂高工程师提出提高产量改进质量的计划未为工人接受，工会即配合党、行政对工人进行教育，工人接受实行之后，压钢板的次数即由二十一次降至十七次，并消灭钢板薄厚不匀的现象，全厂因之获得国家两亿元的奖金。这就大大加强工人与技术员的团结，使生产竞赛得到了技术指导。机修厂铜炉废品竞赛前为百分之六十五，十月中旬，厂工会即派组织委员去帮助解决，至下旬废品率即降低至百分之三十，工会又组织车工写信祝贺，使成绩巩固下来。铁路、煤矿及其他各厂矿工会，均进行了工人家属工作，使工人专心参加竞赛，不受家庭生活及老婆扯腿的影响。
    目前，运动已经全面广泛地展开，但在组织领导上还存在着许多问题需待解决，以使运动继续深入，为此，东北总工会已于本月十五日召开各省、市产业工会生产部长联席会议，总结竞赛的经验教训。
