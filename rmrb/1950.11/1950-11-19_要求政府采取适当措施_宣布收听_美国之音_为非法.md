Demanding that the Government Take Appropriate Measures
    Declare Listening to "Voice of America" Illegal
    As our volunteer army assists the Korean people in fighting the American imperialist armed aggressor forces, we must seriously pay attention to the offensive launched against us by the enemy on another battlefield - the propaganda war. The weapon used by the enemy on this battlefield is the broadcast of the "Voice of America."
    The "Voice of America" is a propaganda tool established by the reactionary ruling authorities of the United States with huge funds. Its main purpose is not only to promote American "civilization" and advertise the American "way of life," but also to have a more sinister and vicious attempt, that is, to use its shameless rumor-making tricks in different ways to paralyze our thinking and further disintegrate our will and determination to oppose American imperialist aggression. The ideological aggression offensive launched by the U.S. imperialism through the "Voice of America" is absolutely coordinated with its military aggression offensive. It attempts to use a two-pronged approach to complete its conspiracy to invade China and enslave the Chinese people.
    The "Voice of America" is by no means an ordinary radio station, but the most effective tool of foreign aggression of the U.S. imperialism. Its radio waves reach every corner, and its languages ​​are various. In particular, its broadcasts to China occupy an important part of its entire program. In order to further attack the Chinese people, it also cooperates with the Kuomintang bandit gang's special agents in the United States, using the most shameless and despicable means to sabotage and slander us. This is intolerable to conscientious patriotic Chinese people.
    But today, there are still some people in China who not only listen to the "Voice of America," but also unintentionally or intentionally do propaganda work for the "Voice of America," so that the rumors that the enemy has planned to use to paralyze our thinking and disintegrate our will and determination to oppose American imperialist aggression are widely spread in society. The magnitude of its harm and the depth of its legacy are self-evident. Yesterday evening, the teachers and students of the Journalism Department of Yenching University invited teachers and students from other departments to hold a forum to discuss this issue. They fully realized the viciousness of the enemy's ideological aggression methods, and felt that in today's situation where the whole country is united in resisting America and aiding Korea, the "Voice of America" ​​broadcast, which is capable of spreading rumors, should no longer be listened to. Therefore, we now make an appeal to our compatriots across the country, hoping that those who have listened to the "Voice of America" ​​in the past will unanimously stop listening from today onwards. At the same time, we also make an appeal to the government, hoping that the government will take appropriate measures in accordance with Article 49 of the Common Program, which "prohibits the use of news to carry out defamation, damage the interests of the country and the people, and incite world war," and declare listening to the enemy's "Voice of America" ​​broadcast illegal. This is the only way to consolidate our ideological defense and completely destroy the aggressive ambitions and actions of our mortal enemy, American imperialism, against us.

### 要求政府采取适当措施  宣布收听“美国之音”为非法

　　要求政府采取适当措施
    宣布收听“美国之音”为非法
    当我们的志愿军协助朝鲜人民和美帝的武装侵略部队进行作战的时候，我们对于敌人在另一战场——宣传战——上对我们所进行的攻势，不能不严重地予以注意。敌人在这个战场上所使用的武器，就是“美国之音”的广播。
    “美国之音”是美国反动统治当局用了巨大经费建立起来的宣传工具。它的主要目的，不仅止于宣扬美国“文明”，替美国“生活方式”做广告，而有其更阴险更毒辣的企图，那就是利用它不同方式的无耻造谣伎俩，来麻痹我们的思想，并进而瓦解我们反对美帝侵略的意志和决心。美帝由“美国之音”发出来的思想侵略攻势，是绝对和它的武力侵略攻势相配合的。它企图用双管齐下的方法，来完成它侵略中国、奴役中国人民的阴谋。
    “美国之音”绝不是普通性质的广播电台，而是美帝最有效的一种对外侵略工具。它的电波无远弗届，它的语言各种都有。尤其对中国的广播，更占它全部节目中的重要部分。它为了更进一步向中国人民进攻，还和蒋介石匪帮的在美特务合作，用最无耻最卑鄙的手段来破坏我们，诬蔑我们。这是有良心的爱国的中国人民所不能容忍的。
    但是在今天，国内还有一部分人不但收听“美国之音”，而且还无意地或有意地替“美国之音”做传播工作，以致敌人有计划地用来麻痹我们思想、瓦解我们反对美帝侵略的意志和决心的谣言，在社会上广泛地传播着。其流毒之大，遗害之深，是不言可喻的。我们燕大新闻学系师生特于昨天晚上邀请他系师生开了一个座谈会，讨论了这个问题，充分认识敌人这种思想侵略手段的毒辣，觉得在举国一致抗美援朝的今天，对于以造谣为能事的“美国之音”广播，实在不应该再去收听。因此，我们现在向全国同胞提出一个呼吁，就是希望过去收听“美国之音”的人，从今天起一致不再收听。同时，我们向政府也提出一个呼吁，就是希望政府根据共同纲领第四十九条“禁止利用新闻以进行诽谤、破坏国家人民的利益和煽动世界战争”的规定，采取适当措施，宣布收听敌人的“美国之音”广播为非法。这样才能巩固我们的思想国防，彻底摧毁我们的死敌美帝对我们的侵略野心和行动。
