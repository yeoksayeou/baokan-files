Xinhua News Agency, 13th: The German people have taken various actions to enthusiastically support the statement of the Eight Foreign Ministers Conference and oppose West German remilitarization. According to a report by the German News Agency: A mass rally of 3,000 people was recently held in Nuremberg, in the American-occupied zone, expressing support for the statement of the Eight Foreign Ministers Conference and urgently demanding the organization of an All-German Constitutional Assembly including representatives from East and West Germany. The conference unanimously passed a resolution demanding that "representatives of the German Democratic Republic and the West German authorities hold negotiations as early as possible to end the state of division between the two parts of our motherland, which was deliberately created by foreign countries for the malicious purpose of preparing for a new war."

According to a report from Telegraph Agency, young workers in the Rheinrohr steel plant in Mülhausen, in the British-occupied zone, have established a committee to stop arms production. An increasing number of Social Democratic Party members and masses are participating in the movement against remilitarization. In Oberhausen, members of the Free German Youth League have jointly formed a joint action committee with youth members of the Social Democratic Party. According to the Dutch newspaper De Waarheid: In Frankfurt, in the American-occupied zone, Social Democratic youth held demonstrations in the streets and distributed leaflets everywhere because the originally scheduled rally to protest remilitarization was banned. In Wadenburg, 6,000 Protestant youth held a rally to protest remilitarization.

    【新华社十三日讯】德国人民采取了各种行动热烈支持八国外长会议声明，反对西德重新军事化。据德意志通讯社消息：美占区纽伦堡最近举行了三千人的群众大会，表示拥护八国外长会议声明，并迫切地要求组织包括东西德代表的全德立宪议会。大会一致通过了决议要求：“德意志民主共和国和西德当局的代表尽早举行谈判，就可以结束外国为了准备新战争的恶意目标而故意造成的我们祖国东西两部分裂的状态。”
    另据电通社消息，在英占区慕尔豪森市的莱因钢管工厂中，青年工人们已成立了制止军火生产委员会。在反对重新军事化的运动中，已有越来越多的社会民主党党员群众参加。在奥贝尔豪森市，自由德国青年联盟盟员已与社会民主党的青年党员共同组成了联合行动委员会。据荷兰真理报消息：在美占区的法兰克福，社会民主党的青年为了原定召开的抗议重新军事化大会被禁，就在大街上举行了示威游行，到处散发传单。在瓦登堡，有六千名基督新教青年举行了抗议重新军事化的大会。
