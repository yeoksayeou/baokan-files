Regarding the relationship between government and military units in the aspects of production, promotion, and marketing of products, the Central Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government has received clear instructions from the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government. The instructions state that, regarding the promotion and marketing of local and industrial products produced by government and military units themselves, given the current difficulties in the marketing of local products, the regulations in the "Instructions Strictly Prohibiting Government and Military Units from Engaging in Commerce" issued in April of this year should be relaxed slightly. That is, if the local trade company cannot sell the local products produced by the government and military units on their behalf, or if the prices of the trade company are not suitable, they should be allowed to sell them on the market themselves. However, this is limited to the local and industrial products produced by the government and military units themselves. In principle, government and military units are still not allowed to engage in the marketing of other general local products. In areas where the institutions of trade companies or cooperatives have not yet been established, or where there are existing institutions but their operational capabilities are insufficient, the government and military units may be specially permitted to operate within a certain scope after being approved by the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council, and should be subject to the leadership and supervision of the local trade authorities.

　　机关部队经营商业限制
    中央贸易部已稍加放宽
    关于机关、部队生产品之推销和运销诸方面与贸易部的关系问题，中央人民政府贸易部已奉到中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会的明确指示。指示说，凡机关、部队自己所生产的土产品和工业品的推销和运销，在目前土产运销困难的情况下，应稍为放宽今年四月间所颁发的“严禁机关、部队经营商业的指示”的规定，即如果当地贸易公司不能代销机关、部队自己生产的土产，或贸易公司的价格不适合时，应准其在市上自行推销。但这只限于机关、部队所生产的土产品和工业品，其他一般土产的运销，原则上仍不准机关、部队经营。在贸易公司或合作社的机构尚未成立的地方，或者已有机构而经营能力不足时，也可在一定范围内经政务院财政经济委员会核准后，特许机关、部队经营，应受当地贸易机关的领导和监督。
