    The Elements of Essay Writing

    There is no fixed rule on how to write essays. The form of essays is very diverse. Essays themselves combine the elements of commentary and literature, so they should meet the requirements of both genres. A light style does not lessen the strict requirements that Bolshevik commentary places on the author. Humorous essays should be serious in their content, in their task, and in their tendency. Artistic form should be original, persuasive, and typical.

    We are merely organizing a few general instructions:

    I. Factual basis, essay subject matter. The foundation of an essay is fact. In most cases, these are solid facts. Names, locations of events, and the truth of the matter are all explained. Even in so-called "problem" essays (which sometimes do not mention concrete, definite facts), the foundation of the essay must still be based on facts. The facts must be generalized. They are not simply fabricated. For example, the essay "The Cheerful Company" by Ilf and Petrov. It doesn't have names or necessary conditions. The phenomenon is so ordinary and generalized that readers don't even need to bother calling out a suitable name.

    Selecting facts is the first step in writing an essay. One often hears complaints that there is no subject matter. Essay writers demand: give me a fact to write an essay about. They also demand that the fact be "essay-like," that is, quite unusual, strange, and interesting.

    An essay writer who seeks strange facts is on the wrong path. There are no essay-like and non-essay-like facts. There are only essay facts that constitute. "Gray" facts (facts that no one notices) can often ignite the fire of satire if a sharp satirical gaze is cast on the part of the fact that can explain an important phenomenon. Therefore, the basic principle of selecting facts is to arm one's observation with the Bolshevik spirit. Those who personally participate in life, who participate in the struggle, who know what tasks the Party puts forward in a certain period, who will choose interesting facts from everyday things. Combativeness—this is an indispensable element of the Soviet essay. To be combative—that is to be observant. The source of facts is infinite, and newspapers and direct expressions of life are its sources. To be interested in life, to participate in life personally, to understand our country and people, to be good at talking to them, these are the conditions without which one cannot write sharp essays.

    Since fact is the foundation of an essay, then for an essay, the correctness of the fact is sacred (this is a commandment), just like for other forms of commentary. Essay writers can be relatively free. Of course, unlike a news report, an essay can adopt a literary style and can supplement facts with imagination in the structure of the article. The narrative tone of a news report can be replaced by dialogue in an essay. Additional events and characters can also be included. However, all of this cannot go beyond the scope of the correctness of the basic facts. Therefore, verifying facts is necessary for essay writers, just as it is for news reporters.

    II. Essay theme, essay idea. The essay writer has a fact, this fact has attracted his attention and is interesting to him. He can form an interesting subject based on this fact. However, there is still no essay at this time if the author does not have a clear idea and theme if he does not know why he is using this fact to write an essay, what is the conclusion of his article, and what phenomenon is the object of his essay.

    The subject matter cannot be entangled with the theme, and our essay writers often make this mistake of entanglement. The facts are sometimes so funny, the subject matter is sometimes so interesting, that it seems as if the goal has already been achieved, and the reader is also happily laughing at seeing the interesting part of the article. However, in fact, it can be seen that this is shooting aimlessly, and this essay does not arouse happy laughter, but arouses a sense of inexplicable confusion. What is the author's idea? Who is he mocking? Is it worth firing a gun at sparrows?

    Sometimes it is said that only serious and important facts can become the basis of the theme of a Soviet essay. However, it is wrong to distinguish facts as important and unimportant. There are only important, unimportant or minor themes, meaningful or meaningless ideas. From facts that seem insignificant or "small" at first glance, great and important ideas and questions can arise. Observant authors have the ability to generalize facts. Phenomena that others turn a blind eye to, phenomena that seem irrelevant, will arouse deep thoughts in essay writers armed with Bolshevism—thoughts about new ways of life, about certain capitalist remnants in people's consciousness.

    Sometimes the theme and idea come first, and then the facts are selected and the subject matter is formed. The theme of friendship and emotion towards people is not new. But it can be refocused and expressed anew each time. For this, it is necessary to draw out the political significance of the theme, think about it and work hard on it, and when re-expressing the theme, it is not difficult to make the necessary selection of facts to illustrate it.

    Bolshevik essay writers are good at finding the important and central aspect in the phenomena that need to be ridiculed for the sake of struggle, and good at finding the enemy's weaknesses. In this case, the attack will be sharp and powerful. Writing essays should assess the situation. One cannot strike at people who make mistakes as forcefully and strongly as at enemies who deliberately carry out harm. Similarly, it is absolutely intolerable for essay writers to strike fiercely at "righteous people" while avoiding talking about important people and major culprits.

    III. Artistic form, "embellishment." The structure of the essay, as well as the sharpness of the writing and the embellishment of the artistic form, should be subordinate to the political significance of the facts, themes, and ideas of the article. If a writer only has sharp words and successful rhetoric in his mind when he goes to work, then he will go down a false path. One must clarify: why write this essay, what purpose does it pursue, who does it ridicule and what does it ridicule. Then one can decide what artistic means to adopt for it.

    Artistic means are very diverse. Any author has his own program: without artistic means, without sharp writing, without humor, without imagery, there is no essay. One will encounter such titles in newspapers: "In Lieu of an Essay." This is often an ordinary news report, but it is mechanically insisted on making a pun on it. Of course, this kind of title is useless. One cannot write essays artistically without ability. One must have a kind of ability expressed in being good at finding appropriate forms of expression, which are either original or obtained in literature and political life. This may be the ability of imagination (a certain degree of fantasy). This ability may be inferior to that of a literary or color artist, to that of a novelist, to that of a poet, but it is still necessary to have it. Without it, there is no essay.

    True, essay writers are not born, essay writers are not made overnight. But, if one is interested in this work and loves it, then one will become an essay writer because of having a lot of experience in this work. A true essay is the result of a certain literary cultivation, in which the Marxist-Leninist political education is combined with literary accomplishment and knowledge of classical artistic literature.

    The art of an essay writer lies in being good at combining truth and imagination, being good at drawing pictures, which still does not go beyond the scope of practical authenticity. The line between essay and thesis, the line between essay and feature and novel are not sharply distinguishable, not very obvious. There is an intermediate area between them. In many cases, arguments inevitably arise: what category should a certain work be classified into, commentary or literature. It is particularly difficult for writers who write articles in newspapers to follow artistic techniques. The "commentary" of essays limits them. When these writers leave newspaper work to engage in literary work, they often cannot get rid of this commentary factor, and their novels and dramas are very much like essays.

    Artistic expression is an indispensable attribute of essays. Art lies in: the organic combination of expression and article material, rather than mechanical combination. This is called the "effect" of expression. The material is arranged in the outline of the expression so that the reader can clearly and easily see the essence of the satirized phenomenon. For this, the author must be familiar with the material, explain it correctly, and must also be very knowledgeable about artistic expression.

    For example, the expression method of Sergeant Prishibeyev often appears in Soviet essays. This is a powerful and expressive method. However, it can often be clearly seen that the author has not read Chekhov's works and does not understand what the main spirit of this expression method lies in. Therefore, he forcibly puts together with it those facts that have only external connections with this expression. One must learn from Lenin and Stalin to be good at correctly and profoundly using artistic expression methods to expose phenomena.

    It is completely legal to adopt the expression methods of classical literature and art. But it cannot be abused. If an essay is mixed with different expression methods, it will make the reader feel tired and bored. Some expression methods and phrases have lost their novelty because they are often used, and they instead make the article have the nature of cliché.

    The weakness of many essay writers is seeking "catchphrases," puns, and jokes. This means is not valuable. The author's facetiousness is annoying, and this attitude lies in concealing ideological emptiness.

    IV. Essay Style. Some not-bad essays sometimes start with humorous descriptions, starting with very sharp contrasts, and then turning to the tone of narration and discussion... This is quite common in the essay world. The author did not consider the structure of his article well. The factual description often accounts for two-thirds of the entire essay, and only the satirical technique appears at the end. Conversely, there is also this situation: it starts with general discussions, these discussions are sometimes interesting, but it has no direct connection with the fact that is the basis of the essay. This kind of talk is reluctantly matched with the facts. All of these top-heavy essay monsters are produced because the author did not consider the structure of the essay, did not have a definite plan, or messed up this plan in the process of work. Sometimes there is also this situation: the author has already considered everything correctly, the paragraphs of the essay have been arranged, but when the editor revises the manuscript, several paragraphs are deleted, and others are lengthened, thus making the structure very strange and the style inconsistent.

    Style is quite an important thing. This lies in the symmetry between the parts of the article, in the proportion between the factual aspects and the writing, in the unity of the textual structure, and in the selection of words, adjectives, and expressions that match the content of the article. It goes without saying that style is the tool used by essays to exert the greatest expressive effect, and one must avoid stereotyped writing, and must oppose relying on the superficial gorgeousness of the words and forms of the article itself. Stereotyped writing is a means used by bourgeois essay writers to embellish their lack of creativity and lack of profound thoughts.

    If the author or editor does not have a sense of style or artistic sense, then the article will have a chaotic and contradictory form, with words that are incompatible with the full text, and with a kind of boring words that are reluctantly filled in after performing surgery on artistic expressions.

    The editor must be very cautious when deleting and revising essays. The author often has his own style. He even has the rhythm of his own sentences. Experienced essay writers who engage in writing essays also calculate the exact number of lines of their essays. For "short essays" (its main characteristic is brevity and pertinence, and every sentence is sharp), it is impossible not to damage its style if several lines are not typeset in the pre-drawn layout. Sometimes it seems easy to delete a sentence. Without this sentence, the idea of the article is more obvious. However, later, sometimes all the way to the end of the article, it is discovered that the style of the article depends on this sentence.

    V. Essay Language. Any newspaper must adopt simple and correct literary language. For the writing of essays, this general requirement is being repeatedly emphasized. An article written in difficult or boring language is still an article, although it is a bad article. An essay written in crude or gray language simply does not become an essay. The power, creativity, and sharpness of words, this is the first condition for an essay to have the right to obtain the name of essay. An essay may sometimes have no humor, sometimes have no artistic technique, but an essay written in the style of a very clever ordinary news report, without literary beauty, becomes a counterfeit essay that pretends to be an essay. It is impossible to save this point with any topic. If "dialogue" is used to replace the ordinary narrative tone in the article, then this primitive disguise will not help. The author can write all sentences in dialogue. He does not use the phrase "cloudy morning," he writes: "Ivan Ivanovich yawned, stretched his waist, and asked: 'How is the weather today?' Ivan Petrovich lazily looked out the window, shook his hand, and replied listlessly: 'Cloudy.'" This kind of cheap trick will not turn a news report into an essay or a feature.

    The power and expressiveness of words lie in its direct conformity with the power and clarity of thought. The embellishment, playfulness, and gorgeousness of words are sufficient to prove the unclearness, confusion, and timidity of thought. Lenin pointed out more than once that the gorgeous rhetoric of the Menshevik Petrov was a means to conceal his timidity, opportunism, and ideological emptiness.

    The simplicity and clarity of words, just like the simplicity of the Bolsheviks, is the attribute of the Bolshevik style. Loud tones, mean words, hysterical screams, all of this has nothing in common with the traditions of Bolshevik commentary. The stacking of literary rhetoric looks like a clown wearing colorful clothes in an old-fashioned circus. This kind of essay writer in the Soviet press has not completely disappeared: they want to rely on their effortless involvement in the literary field, and want to try to make the article terribly gorgeous by relying on many quotations. All of this is in vain. This kind of variegated thing cannot explain his literary accomplishment, but can only explain his lack of good literary appreciation. Using many quotations does not make up for the poverty of one's own vocabulary.

### 怎样写小品文？

　　新闻工作
    小品文的要素
    小品应该怎样写，这是无法规定一条规则的。小品文的形式是非常多样的。小品文本身结合着评论和文艺两种因素，所以它应该满足这两种文体的要求。轻松的风格并不减轻布尔什维克评论对作者所提出的严格要求。幽默小品应该在其内容上，在其任务上，在其趋向上是严肃的。艺术形式应该是独创的，具有说服力的，具有典型性的。
    我们仅仅组织了几条一般性指示：
    一、事实基础，小品题材。小品文的基础是事实。在大多数情况下，这是确确凿凿的事实。人名，出事地点，事情真相都说明。就是在所谓“问题”小品（里面有时候没有提到实在的，确凿的事实）里，小品的基础仍然必须有事实根据。事实要一般化。它们不是简单的杜撰。譬如伊里夫和彼得罗夫的小品《愉快的部队》。里面没有名字，也没有需要的条件。现象是平常和一般化到这样地步：以致读者都不用费神去称呼一个适当的名字。
    选择事实，这是写小品的第一步。常常听见诉苦说：没有题材。小品作家要求：给我一个事实写小品。他们同时要求事实是“小品性的”，这就是说相当地不平凡，奇怪而有趣的。
    小品作家，如果他寻求着奇怪的事实，他就走上了错误的道路。没有小品性和非小品性的事实。只有小品的事实构成。“灰色”的事实（谁也不注意的事实）常常也会燃起讽刺之火，如果有一双锐利的讽刺目光射到了这个事实里能够说明重要现象的那一部分。所以，选择事实的基本原则，就是以布尔什维克的精神来武装自己的观察力。谁亲自参加了生活，谁参加了斗争，谁知道党在一定时期内提出什么任务，谁就会从日常的事物里选择有趣的事实。战斗性——这是苏联小品文必不可缺的因素。成为战斗性的——这就是说要成为善于观察的。事实的来源是无限的，报纸以及生活的直接表现都是它的来源。要对生活感兴趣，亲身参加到生活里去，了解我们的国家和人们，善于同他们谈话，这些都是条件，没有这些条件就不能写出尖锐的小品。
    既然事实是小品的基础，那末对于小品来讲，事实的正确性就是神圣的（这是诫律），正如对于其他形式的评论一样。小品作家可以比较自由。当然，有别于通讯，小品是可以采用文艺笔调的，可以在文章的结构里以假想来补充事实。通讯的叙说语气在小品文里可以用对话方式来替代。还可以列入补充的事情和人物。然而这一切都不能越出基本事实的正确性的范围。因此，核对事实，对于小品作家来讲是必要的，正如对通讯记者那样。
    二、小品主题，小品思想。小品作家有了事实，这个事实是引起他注意的并且对他说来是有趣的。他就能根据这个事实来形成有趣的题材。然而这时候还没有小品文，如果作者没有明确的思想和主题，如果他不知道为什么要用这个事实写小品，什么是他文章的结论，他的小品的对象是什么现象。
    题材不能和主题纠缠起来，而我们的小品作家常常犯这个纠缠的毛病。事实有时是如此可笑，题材有时是如此有趣，以致看起来好像目的就已经达到了，而读者也在看到文章里令人感兴趣的一部分而高兴地发笑。然而事实上可以看出，这是无的放矢，这篇小品并没有引起高兴的笑，而引起了莫明其妙之感。作者的想法是什么呢？他在嘲笑谁呢？对麻雀放枪是否值得呢？
    有时候有人说，只有严重和重要的事实才能成为苏联小品的主题的基础。但是，区分事实为重要和不重要是不对的。只有重要、不重要或细小的主题，有意义或无意义的思想。从那种一瞥之下似乎是微不足道或“细小的”事实上，可以产生巨大而重要的思想和问题。善于观察的作者有能力使事实一般化。其他人熟视无睹的，看起来似乎是无关重要的现象，会引起以布尔什维克主义武装起来的小品作家产生深刻的思想—关于新的生活方式，关于人们意识中某些资本主义残余的思想。
    有时候先有主题和思想，然后才选择事实和形成题材。关于对人们友谊和情感的主题不是新的。但是它可以重新集中说明，每次重新加以表现。为此，就需要得出主题的政治意义，对它加以思考和下功夫，当重新表现主题时，可以并不困难地进行事实的必要选择来加以说明。
    布尔什维克小品作家善于寻找那种为进行斗争而需要加以嘲笑的现象里的重要的、中心的一面，善于寻找敌人的弱点。如此情况之下，这一击就会是锐利而有力的。写小品应该估计情况。不能对犯错误的人，像对故意进行危害的敌人那样有力和强烈地加以打击。同样也决不能容忍小品作家对“义道手”进行极猛烈的打击，而对重要的人物，主要肇事者避而不谈。
    三、艺术形式，“润色”。小品的结构以及锋利文笔和艺术形式的润色，应该服从于文章的事实、主题和思想的政治意义。如果一位作家头脑里只有锋利的字句和成功的辞藻就去进行工作，那他就会走上虚伪的道路。自己必须弄明确：为什么写这篇小品文，它追求什么目的，它嘲笑谁和嘲笑什么。然后才能决定，为了它而采用什么艺术手段。
    艺术手段是非常多样的。任何作者都有他自己的纲领：没有艺术手段，没有锋利的文笔，没有幽默，没有图景，就没有小品。在报纸上会遇到这样的标题：“代小品”。这往往就是普通的通讯，而对它却机械地偏要说双关话。当然，这种标题是不济事的。没有能力就不能艺术地写出小品。必须具有一种表现在善于寻找适当表现形式的能力，这种表现形式或者是自己独创的，或者是在文学里和政治生活里获得的。这也许就是想像（某种程度的幻想）的能力。比起文字或色彩艺术家，比起小说家，比起诗人来这个能力还可以差一些，然而它仍然是需要有的。没有它，就没有小品。
    诚然，小品作家不是天生的，小品作家不是一下做成的。但是，如果对这门工作有志趣，爱好它，那就会因为在这工作上有很多经历而成为小品作家。真正的小品文，是一定的文学修养的结果，在这个修养里，马列主义的政治教育与文学素养，与古典艺术文学的知识结合起来。
    小品作家的艺术，在于善于将真相和想像结合起来，善于描画出图景，这仍然不越出实际真实性的范围。小品文与论文之间的界线，小品文与特写和小说之间的界线并不是截然可分的，并不是十分明显的。它们之间存在着中间领域。在许多情况下老是不可避免地发生争论：某一个作品应该算作那一类，算作评论呢还是算作文艺。在报纸上写文章的作家特别难于遵循艺术笔法。小品文的“评论性”限制了他们。这些作家在离开报纸工作从事文学工作时，又往往不能摆脱这种评论因素，他们的小说和戏剧就很像小品文。
    艺术表现形式，是小品文必不可缺的属性。艺术是在于：表现形式与文章材料有机地结合起来，而不是机械地凑合的。这就称为表现形式的“效果”。材料布置在表现形式的轮廓里，以便就使读者很明显和容易地看到被讽刺的现象的实质。为此，作者必须熟悉材料，正确地加以说明，并且还必须很懂得艺术表现形式。
    譬如说，苏联的小品文里常常出现军士普里希彼耶夫的表现法。这是一种有力而善于表达的方法。然而常常可以清楚地看出来，作者没有读过契诃夫的作品，也不懂这种表现法的主要精神何在，因此，他就把那些与这种表现只有外表联系的事实与它硬凑在一起。必须向列宁和斯大林学习，才会善于正确地和深刻地运用艺术的表现法来暴露现象。
    采用古典文艺的表现法是完全合法的。但是不能滥用。小品文如果掺杂着采用不同的表现法，就会使读者感到疲劳和厌烦。有些表现法和辞句，因为常用而失去了新奇之感，它们反而使文章带有陈腔烂调的性质。
    许多小品作家的弱点，是寻求“警语”、双关语和趣话。这种手段是不可贵的。作者的嬉皮笑脸是令人生厌的，这种态度是在于掩饰思想上的空洞。
    四、小品风格。有些不坏的小品文有时候是从幽默描写开始，从很尖锐的对比开始，然后再转向叙说和讲论的语气……。这是在小品界里相当习见的事。作者没有很好地考虑自己文章的结构。事实方面的叙述往往就占整篇小品文的三分之二，只在最后才出现讽刺的笔法。反之，也有这种情形：一开始就是泛泛的谈论，这些谈论有时候是有趣的，然而它与作为小品文基础的事实没有直接联系。这种谈论与事实勉强地凑合。所有这一切头重脚轻的小品怪物，其产生都是由于作者没有考虑小品文的结构，没有确实的计划，或者在工作进程中错乱了这个计划。有时候也有这种情形：作者已经把一切都正确地考虑好，小品的各段都已经布置好，然而在编辑改稿时，却删去了若干段，另外却又延长了几段，因而弄得结构很古怪，风格也不一致。
    风格是一件相当重要的事情。这就是在于文章各部分间的匀称，在于事实方面与笔法之间的相称，在于文字结构的统一以及在于选择与文章内容相称的辞句，形容词和表现法。不言而喻，风格是小品文用以发挥最大表达效果的工具，必须避免八股化，必须反对依赖文章本身辞藻和形式的外表华丽。八股化乃是资产阶级小品作家用以粉饰其缺乏创造与缺乏深刻思想的手段。
    如果作者或编辑没有风格感或艺术感，那末文章就会带着混乱和矛盾的形式，带着与全文格格不入的辞藻，带着一种在对艺术表现形式实施外科手术之后勉强填进去的乏味的字句。
    编辑在删改小品文时必须很慎重。作者往往有他自己的风格。甚至还有他自己句子的韵律。从事写小品文的有经验的小品作家，还计算好自己小品文确实的行数。对于“短篇小品”（它的主要特点就是简短中肯，句句尖锐），如果把几行没有排进预先画好的版样里去的话，就不可能不损害它的风格。有时候看起来删掉一句话似乎很容易。没有这句话，文章的思想更加明显。但是，到后来，有时候一直到文章结尾时才发现，文章的风格就靠这一句话。
    五、小品语言。任何报纸都必须采用简单的、正确的文学语言。对于小品文的写作，这个一般性要求是在一再地被强调着。用难懂或乏味的语言来写的文章，总算还是文章，虽然是不好的文章。用粗劣或灰色的语言来写的小品，简直就不成其为小品。文字的力量，创造性和锐利性，这是小品文所以能有权获得小品名称的第一个条件。小品有时可以没有幽默，有时可以没有艺术笔法，但是，用很高明的普通通讯风格来写的、没有文学之美的小品文，就成为冒充小品文的赝品。不论用任何题目都无法挽救这一点。如果用“对话体”来代替文章里普通的叙述语气，那末这种原始的掩饰法也是无补于事的。作者尽管可以用对话体来写一切句子。他不用“阴天的早晨”这句话，他写：“伊凡·伊凡诺维奇打了个呵欠，伸一伸腰，问道：‘今天天气怎样？’伊凡·彼得罗维奇懒洋洋地望望窗外，摇摇手，没精打彩地回答：‘阴天’。”用这种廉价的诡计是不会把通讯弄成小品或特写的。
    文字的力量及表达能力，乃在于它与思想的力量及明确性之间的直接符合。文字的虚饰，玩弄和华丽，适足以证明思想上的不明确，混乱和怯弱。列宁不止一次地指出过，孟什维克党人彼得罗夫的辞藻华丽乃是一种手段，用以掩饰其胆怯，机会主义和思想上的空洞。
    文字上的简单明了，正如布尔什维克的朴素那样，乃是布尔什维克风格的属性。嚣嚷的语调，刻薄的字句，歇斯底里的叫嚣，这一切与布尔什维克评论的传统毫无共同之点。文学辞藻的堆砌，看来就像旧式马戏场上穿着杂色衣服的小丑。苏联报界里这种小品作家还没有完全绝迹：他们想靠他在文学领域里的不费功夫的涉猎，想靠许多援引句来试图把文章写得可怕地华丽。这一切都是徒然的。这种杂色东西不能说明他的文学素养，只能说明他缺乏良好的文学鉴赏力。用许多援引句，并不能补足自己语汇的贫乏。
