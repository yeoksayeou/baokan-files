Strengthening Militia Work

Currently, there are over 5.5 million militiamen in the country. This is a people's armed force that grew and strengthened under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party during China's long revolutionary war.

The militia had a glorious history of struggle during the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, they launched widespread guerrilla warfare against the enemy, becoming a powerful assistant to the main forces and local corps. Based on the principle of combining combat and production, they fought against the enemy, either independently or in coordination with the main forces, severely打击打击了敌人 and played a significant role in defeating Japanese imperialism. In the War of Liberation, they actively打击打打击了敌人 everywhere, coordinating with the People's Liberation Army in frontal operations. They launched a large-scale movement to join the army and participate in the war. In North China, East China, and Northeast China, millions of people volunteered to join the army, most of whom were militiamen who had been tempered by war and had considerable military and political qualities. This shows that the militia, in its history of development, has been a strong reserve base for the People's Liberation Army. The scale of militia participation in the war and support for the front was even greater. Shandong Province alone organized 50 regiments, with the farthest participants reaching Fujian. The militiamen participating in the war from Shanxi reached as far west as Ganliang in the Northwest and as far north as Suiyuan and Inner Mongolia. The militiamen participating in the war from Hebei reached as far south as Henan and as far north as Chahar. They were not afraid of hardships and undertook the work of supporting the front, which reduced many difficulties for our army and enabled us to overthrow the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang and establish a new China with people's democratic dictatorship in the not-so-long period of three years. After the victory of the War of Liberation, the militia became one of the powerful pillars for consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship. They played a significant role in剿滅剿滅土匪 and protecting social order. In the 3,194剿匪剿匪 operations in Henan, Hubei, Hunan, and Guangxi provinces alone, 51,825 militiamen participated, killing, wounding, and capturing 8,969 bandits in combat. In the land reform movement, the militia assisted the government in effectively suppressing counter-revolutionary activities and protecting the interests of the peasants who had turned over a new leaf. All of the above shows that the militia has played an extremely important role in every period of the Chinese revolution.

The great Chinese people's revolution has achieved complete victory on the Chinese mainland, but the enemy is not reconciled to their defeat. They are still struggling. The remnants of the Kuomintang bandit gang, under the cover of US imperialism, occupy Taiwan, attempting to make a comeback, and organize bandits and secret agents on the mainland to sabotage our country's production and construction and the people's lives and property. According to statistics, there are still more than 200,000 bandits in the southern provinces waiting for us to wipe them out. More importantly, US imperialism has launched armed aggression against Korea and our territory of Taiwan, and is bombing Northeast China with aircraft, attempting to further expand the war of aggression to China. Under this circumstance, the primary task of the people and the People's Liberation Army is to continue to struggle for the liberation of the unliberated territory, to剿滅剿滅土匪 and special agents, to build a strong national defense force, to resist US aggression and aid Korea, to defend the independence and territorial integrity of the motherland, and to consolidate and develop the victorious achievements of the Chinese people. The militia also bears an important mission in this regard.

According to the Common Program, citizens of the People's Republic of China have the obligation to defend the motherland and perform military service. The program also stipulates that "the People's Republic of China implements a militia system to protect local order, establish a national mobilization foundation, and prepare to transition to a compulsory military service system at an appropriate time." According to this policy, the militia is a strong reserve force of the People's Liberation Army.

Why should our country transition to a compulsory military service system by implementing a militia system? Because the militia is an armed force of the masses that does not separate from production and has close ties with the masses, it is easy to absorb young men of suitable military age to join. In the past, the militia consciously and organizationally joined the army and participated in the war, and has actually become a solid foundation for the reserve soldiers of the People's Liberation Army. Therefore, the militia system can serve as a bridge to the compulsory military service system. When the compulsory military service system is implemented, every man of the age in the country has the obligation to perform military service. It is impossible to implement a compulsory military service system unless the people have generally undergone land reform and turned over a new leaf, their economic status has not been improved, their political consciousness has not been raised, the ideological foundation for performing military service has not been established, and a large number of young men suitable for military service have not been涌入涌入民兵民兵 organization and undergone considerable military training.

The central task at present is to consolidate the militia organization, develop from focused development to universal development, improve the leading bodies at all levels of the militia, develop the militia in conjunction with mass movements, strengthen the military and political training of the militia, improve the quality of the militia, and enable the militia to perform various tasks such as剿匪剿匪肅特, protecting local order, and protecting production and construction under unified leadership.

In order to strengthen the construction of the militia, first, cadres at all levels should generally recognize the importance of establishing the militia. The phenomenon that some cadres in the past thought that the revolution had been won and no longer attached importance to the work of the militia should be corrected. Militia cadres at all levels should strengthen the study of current affairs and politics, improve their ideological level, and establish the idea of serving the people's armed cause for a long time. Ideas such as not being content with the current position, asking for a transfer, or changing careers are all wrong.

Second, leading bodies of the people's armed forces at all levels should be established and improved as soon as possible. People's Armed Forces Departments should be established from top to bottom, under the leadership of military organs, to manage the construction of the militia. Military regions at all levels should devote a large part of their efforts to strengthen the leadership of the militia work in order to establish a more organized and more universal people's armed forces. (The central task of military sub-districts without troops is to do militia work.)

Third, the consolidation and development of the militia organization should be carried out in a planned and step-by-step manner in conjunction with mass movements such as land reform and剿匪剿匪. The focus of militia construction should be placed in rural areas, and special attention should be paid to the militia construction in border defense and coastal defense areas. Generally speaking, in new and semi-old areas, the existing militia should first be rectified to maintain the purity of the militia components. Children of landlords and rich peasants, hooligans, bullies, and those with unclear histories and reactionary ideas who have not been reformed should not be absorbed into the militia. Destructive elements who have混混进民兵民兵 organization should be properly handled. According to the principle of mobilizing the masses, organizing the masses, and arming the masses, the broad masses of working people aged 18 to 30 should be gradually organized into the backbone militia, and the broad masses of working people aged 18 to 45 should be gradually organized into the general militia. In the old areas, the militia should be developed in large numbers and cautiously. In the new areas, the militia should be developed step by step and with focus. Efforts should be made to develop the militia to about 5% of the national population in two or three years. In the development of the militia, attention must be paid to preventing possible deviations such as indiscriminate absorption without principle and the simple pursuit of quantity.

Fourth, establish a more regular training system. The militia should be trained regularly to improve their political, cultural, and military technical level. The focus of militia training is the backbone militia. The militia should generally receive general minimum military training, know how to use their weapons, and be familiar with the actions of individual combat. For training methods, training stations should be established in each county and district, and rotational training should be implemented by village. This winter and next spring, militia training in both new and old liberated areas should generally focus on political education and supplemented by military training. Education on relevant policies and laws should be conducted based on the current main tasks in rural areas (such as剿匪剿匪 and land reform), as well as education on current affairs such as resisting US aggression and aiding Korea, protecting the country and defending the country, and anti-rumor struggles, in order to enhance the patriotic and internationalist spirit of the militia. Secondly, general military training should be conducted.

After the above-mentioned tasks have been carried out, our militia construction work will naturally be greatly advanced, and the militia will become a stronger people's armed force.

### 加强民兵工作

　　加强民兵工作
    现在全国共有五百五十多万民兵。这是在中国长期革命战争中在中国共产党领导下生长壮大起来的一支人民武装。
    民兵在抗日战争时期和解放战争时期，都有过光荣的斗争历史。在抗日战争时期，他们对敌人展开广泛的游击战争，成为主力军及地方兵团的有力助手。他们在战斗与生产相结合的原则下，对敌人作斗争，或者单独作战，或者配合主力作战，严重地打击了敌人，对于打败日本帝国主义起了重大的作用。在解放战争中，他们到处积极打击敌人，配合了人民解放军在正面的作战。他们曾开展了大规模的参军参战运动。华北、华东、东北自愿参军者达数百万人，其中大部分是经过战争锻炼与有相当军事政治素养的民兵，这说明了民兵在其发展历史上就是人民解放军有力的后备基础。民兵参战支前的规模更大，仅山东一省即曾组织了五十个团，参战最远的到达福建。山西参战的民兵西至西北甘凉，北至绥蒙，河北参战的民兵南至河南北至察北，他们均不畏艰险，担承了支援前线的工作，使我军减少了许多困难，得以在为时不长的三年当中推翻了国民党反动统治，建立了人民民主专政的新中国。在解放战争胜利后民兵又成为巩固人民民主专政的有力支柱之一，他们在剿灭土匪，保护社会秩序上都起了很大作用。仅河南、湖北、湖南、广西四省剿匪作战三一九四次中，参加的民兵即有五一八二五名，他们在作战中毙伤俘匪八九六九名。在土地改革运动中，民兵曾协助政府有效地镇压了反革命活动，保护了农民翻身利益。上述这一切都说明了民兵在中国革命各个时期均起了极其重大的作用。
    中国人民大革命已在中国大陆取得完全胜利，但敌人并不甘心于他们的失败，他们还在继续挣扎，国民党残余匪帮在美帝国主义掩护之下盘据台湾，企图死灰复燃，并在大陆上组织土匪和特务和我们捣乱，破坏我们国家的生产建设和人民的生命财产。据统计，南方数省尚有二十多万土匪待我们去肃清。尤其重要的是，美帝国主义已对朝鲜和我国领土台湾实行武装侵略，并以飞机轰炸我国东北，企图把侵略战争进一步扩大到中国。在此种情势下，全国人民与人民解放军的首要任务就是要为解放尚未解放的国土，剿灭土匪特务，建设强大的国防军，抗美援朝，保卫祖国的独立与领土的完整，巩固与发展中国人民胜利的成果而继续奋斗。民兵在这方面同样担负着重要的任务。
    根据共同纲领规定，中华人民共和国国民有保卫祖国应征兵役的义务。纲领并规定“中华人民共和国实行民兵制度，保卫地方秩序，建立国家动员基础，并准备在适当时机过渡到义务兵役制”，按照这种方针，民兵正是人民解放军强大的后备军。
    为什么我国要以实行民兵制度来过渡到义务兵役制呢？因为民兵是不脱离生产的群众武装，与群众有密切的联系，易于吸收适合兵役年龄的壮丁参加进去。民兵过去自觉地有组织地参军参战，实际上已成为人民解放军的有力预备兵的基础。因此，民兵制度可以作为过渡到义务兵役制的桥梁。到实行义务兵役制时，全国国民中每一个及龄的男子都有服兵役的义务。在人民尚未普遍经过土改翻身，经济地位尚未改善，政治觉悟尚未提高，服兵役的思想基础尚未建立，适合兵役壮丁尚未大量涌入民兵组织并且经过相当军训的条件下，是不可能实行义务兵役制的。
    目前应作的中心工作就是整理民兵组织，从有重点的发展到普遍的发展，健全民兵的各级领导机构，结合群众运动发展民兵，加强对民兵的军事的及政治的训练，提高民兵的质量，使民兵在统一领导下，执行剿匪肃特保卫地方秩序、保卫生产建设等各种任务。
    为了加强民兵的建设工作，第一、应使各级干部普遍认识建立民兵的重要性。过去有些干部以为革命已经胜利不再重视民兵工作的现象应该纠正。各级民兵干部，都应加强时事政治的学习，提高自己的思想水平，确立长远为人民武装事业服务的思想。不安心现职，闹转业，改行等等思想都是不对的。
    第二、应迅速建立与健全各级人民武装的领导机构，自上而下建立各级人民武装部，统归军事机关领导，以掌管民兵建设。各级军区应分出大部力量来加强领导民兵工作，以建立更有组织更加普遍的人民武装。（无部队的军区分区的中心任务就是作民兵工作。）
    第三、应结合土地改革、剿匪等群众运动有计划有步骤的巩固与发展民兵组织。民兵建设的重点应放在农村，特别要注意边防海防地区的民兵建设工作。一般说，新区半老区应先进行现有民兵的整顿，保持民兵成份的纯洁，未经过改造的地富子弟、兵痞流氓、奸霸及历史不清、思想反动的分子不应吸收参加民兵，对已混进民兵组织中的破坏分子，则须妥善地加以处理。应根据发动群众组织群众与武装群众相结合的原则将十八至三十岁的广大劳动人民逐渐组织到基干民兵中去，并逐渐将十八至四十五岁的广大劳动人民组织到一般民兵中去。在老区，民兵应大量而又慎重地发展。在新区，应有步骤有重点地发展。应当争取在两三年内使民兵发展到占全国人口百分之五左右。在发展民兵中必须注意防止可能产生的无原则地乱吸收、单纯追求数量的偏向。
    第四、建立较正规的训练制度。对民兵应进行经常的训练，去提高他们的政治、文化及军事技术的水平。民兵训练的重点为基干民兵。应使民兵普遍受过一般的最低限度的军事训练，会使用自己的武器，并熟悉单个战斗的动作。训练方法，应在各县区普遍设立训练站，以村为单位实行轮回训练。今冬明春，无论新老解放区的民兵训练一般均应以政治教育为主，军事训练为辅。应根据农村当前主要任务（如剿匪、土改）进行有关的政策法令教育，以及抗美援朝保家卫国反谣言斗争等时事教育，以提高民兵爱国主义国际主义的精神。其次才是进行一般的军事训练。
    在进行了上述各项工作之后，我们的民兵建设工作自然就会大大地向前推进一步，民兵就会成为更坚强的人民武装力量。
