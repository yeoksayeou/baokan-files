    Bandit Agents Ma Defu, You Maozhi, and Five Others Executed Yesterday
    Remaining Criminals Wang Jianguo and Ten Others Sentenced to Imprisonment, etc.
    [Our Dispatch] According to the Beijing Municipal News Office: The Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau recently cracked a hidden secret agent organization "Hebei People's Self-Defense Army," commissioned by the American imperialists and Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, attempting to carry out sabotage activities in Beijing, Tianjin, and other places. Bandit Deputy Commander Ma Defu, You Maozhi, and 15 other bandit agents were captured. The following evidence was seized: one American-made submachine gun, one American-made Canadian pistol, two rifles, one Browning pistol, one Japanese-style pistol, 205 rounds of various bullets; eight orders, special agent activity funds of sixty-six taels and six fen of gold, two secret letters, and one telegram.

    The Military Law Office of the Beijing Municipal Military Control Commission publicly tried this case on the 21st, sentencing the chief culprits of the bandit agents, Ma Defu, You Maozhi, Liu Zhenya, Guo Dianyu, and Sun Jinchen, to death in court, and immediately escorted them to the execution ground to be shot. The remaining criminals, Wang Jianguo and ten others, were sentenced to imprisonment and other punishments.

    The public trial began at 9:00 a.m., with Wang Feiran, Director of the Military Law Office, serving as the presiding judge. People's representatives from Fangshan, Laishui, Zhuoxian, and other places who had suffered from the harm of these bandit agents attended the court to testify. Representatives from central government agencies, democratic parties, people's organizations, and judicial organs in Beijing, totaling approximately 500 people, were in attendance. First, Feng Jiping, Deputy Director of the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau, filed a public prosecution against the case, listing the monstrous crimes of these bandit agents in harming the country and the people, and requested the Military Law Office to strengthen the spirit of suppressing counter-revolutionary activities and impose severe punishment to eliminate harm for the people. The interrogation of the fifteen criminals then began. Facing the conclusive evidence of witnesses and material objects, these bandit agents could not deny the counter-revolutionary crimes they had committed and confessed to them one after another.

    During and after the interrogation process, people's representatives from various affected areas filed accusations, exposing the crimes of these bandit agents in opposing the people and the People's Government with the real situation of the persecution suffered by local residents. They demanded that the government stand up for the people and execute Ma Defu and other leading figures. Chen Yuan, a member of the Beijing Municipal People's Representative Conference Consultative Committee and President of Fu Jen Catholic University, Shi Yaoxian, a representative of the Preparatory Committee of the Federation of Industry and Commerce, Gao Yuying, a representative of the Municipal Women's Federation, and Xu Naiming, a representative of the Municipal Student Federation, also spoke on behalf of all sectors of Beijing: They all believed that these bandit agents had committed heinous crimes and must be severely punished to avenge the dead and eliminate harm for the people. They also unanimously expressed their support for the government's work in strengthening the suppression of counter-revolutionary activities and would do their best in their respective positions to assist the government in preventing traitors and secret agents, and consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship.

    Finally, Director Wang Feiran, on behalf of the Military Law Office, read out the verdict, sentencing Ma Defu and other five bandits to death. Applause immediately erupted, and the people were greatly satisfied.
