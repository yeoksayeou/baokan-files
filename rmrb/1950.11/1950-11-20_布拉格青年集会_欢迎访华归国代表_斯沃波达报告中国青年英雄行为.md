　　Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 18th: A youth rally was held in Prague, the capital of Czechoslovakia, on the 15th in the Lucerna Hall to welcome the Czech representatives of the World Federation of Democratic Youth delegation returning from China. The chairman of the Czechoslovak Youth League, Hertzl, delivered a welcome speech, saying: "Taking the opportunity of the World Federation of Democratic Youth's representatives staying here after their visit to China, we pay tribute to our Chinese brothers and sisters who are far away, to all those who are bravely fighting in the volunteer forces for the freedom and independence of Korea, to those who are liberating Tibet, and to those who are preparing to strike at the imperialist aggressors in Taiwan."

　　Svoboda, editor-in-chief of the Czechoslovak Youth League's newspaper "Youth Front" and a member of the delegation to China, gave a lengthy report on his visit to China. He said: From the very beginning of the Korean War, we understood very clearly that the American aggression against Korea was only a preparatory step for a direct attack on China. The Chinese youth assured us that they must help their fraternal country and that they would never allow the American aggressors to strangle the freedom of the Korean people. Now the Chinese youth are fulfilling their sacred promise and will certainly complete this promise.

    【新华社布拉格十八日电】捷京布拉格的青年，于十五日在留色纳大厅欢迎访华归国的世界民主青年联盟代表团的捷克代表。捷克斯洛伐克青年联盟主席赫兹拉尔致欢迎词称：“我们借世界民主青年联盟的代表访华归来在这里逗留的机会，向远隔关山的我们中国兄弟姊妹们致敬，向所有为朝鲜的自由和独立正在志愿部队里英勇作战的人们致敬，向正在解放西藏的人们致敬，向正在准备打击台湾的帝国主义侵略者的人们致敬。”
    捷克斯洛伐克青年联盟机关报《青年阵线》总编辑、访华代表斯沃波达作了关于访问中国的长篇报告。他说：朝鲜战争一开始我们就看得很明白，美国侵略朝鲜不过是直接进攻中国的准备步骤。中国的青年们向我们保证，他们一定要帮助他们的兄弟之邦，他们决不容许美国侵略者扼杀朝鲜人民的自由。现在中国青年们正履行他们的神圣诺言，并且一定会完成这种诺言。
