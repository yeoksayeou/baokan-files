Xinhua News Agency, Kangzang Front, 4th. The People's Liberation Army troops advancing on the Kangzang Plateau are in high spirits and morale. On the way from Kangding to Ganzi, the soldiers crossed Mount Zheduo, which is more than 4,700 meters above sea level. While pushing forward with bayonets through the snow, they shouted loud slogans: "This is the glorious road of the Red Army's Long March, carry forward the glorious tradition of the Red Army's hardship."

On the grassland by the Yalong River, 3,500 meters above sea level, the soldiers set up tents, hanging red "August 1st" military emblems on the doors, and pasting couplets such as "Implement resolute plans and complete the advance mission" on both sides of the tent doors. During the gaps in the march, on the vast grasslands around the camp, the soldiers used the gaps in the march to play ball, play chess, carry out cultural and recreational activities, study ethnic policies, and formulate their own combat plans.

On the National Day of October 1st, after eight consecutive hours of mountain climbing and wading, a certain unit held a warm celebration meeting on a deserted grassland. At the meeting, the leaders of a certain regiment led all the commanders and fighters to dance the Yangko around the waving military flag, and lit a roaring bonfire under the starry sky. All the commanders and fighters gathered around the fire to celebrate the holiday night. The regimental leader read out a letter of determination to the higher authorities: "In order to liberate Tibet, complete the great cause of the motherland's unification, and defend the national defense, we are willing to dedicate everything we have, resolutely overcome all difficulties, and complete the tasks assigned to us by the Central People's Government and the people of the whole country." This letter of determination was immediately unanimously supported by all the commanders and fighters. Many units held grassland dinners, recollection evenings, and army-civilian get-together evenings on this day.

The engineering unit of a certain unit supporting the advance into Tibet issued a vow at the National Day celebration: "Wherever the troops fight, we will build the road there. We hope to go to the most difficult places. We want to participate in the construction of Tibet for a long time."

The Tibetan compatriots on the northern Kang grassland still deeply remember the history of the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army passing through here in 1936 on its way north to resist Japan and helping them organize the Bopa government (i.e., the Tibetan people's government). Now, when the Tibetan compatriots saw that the Red Army of that year had returned stronger and with victory, they welcomed the Liberation Army like welcoming relatives. After the Liberation Army was stationed in various parts of northern Kang, it often helped Tibetan compatriots carry water, chop firewood, cut highland barley, and treat diseases. It also constantly performed operas, showed movies, and held get-together parties for the Tibetan compatriots. A harmonious military-civilian relationship and a dear ethnic relationship were established between the Liberation Army and the Tibetan compatriots. Therefore, the Tibetan compatriots enthusiastically supported the advance of the Liberation Army.

　　挺进康藏大军士气高昂
    发扬红军长征时代艰苦光荣传统
    坚决战胜一切困难完成进军任务
    【新华社康藏前线四日电】挺进在康藏高原上的人民解放军各路大军，情绪愉快，士气高昂。在由康定到甘孜的途中，战士们翻越过海拔四千七百多公尺的折多山，他们一面用刺刀拨雪前进，一面高喊着响亮的口号：“这是红军长征时代的光荣道路，发扬红军的艰苦光荣传统。”
    在海拔三千五百公尺的雅砻江边的草原上，战士们搭起一片片的帐篷，在帐篷的门上悬挂着红色的“八一”军徽，在帐篷的门两边贴着“执行决心计划，完成进军任务”一类的对联。在进军的空隙时间里，就在这营地周围的广阔的草地上，战士们利用进军的空隙，玩着球、下着棋，进行文化娱乐活动，学习民族政策和订出了自己的战斗计划。
    十月一日国庆节，某部经过连续八小时的爬山涉水后，在一片荒芜人烟的草地上，召开了热烈的庆祝国庆节的大会。会上，某团首长率领全体指战员绕着招展的军旗扭起了大秧歌，在满天繁星下燃起熊熊野火，全体指战员围火欢度节日的夜晚。团首长宣读了致上级的决心书：“为了解放西藏，完成祖国的统一大业，保卫国防，我们愿意献出我们的一切，坚决战胜一切困难，完成中央人民政府和全国人民交给我们的任务。”这一决心书，立即得到了全场指战员们的一致拥护。许多单位在这一天举行了草地会餐、回忆晚会、军民联欢晚会。
    支援进军西藏的工兵部队某部在国庆节的庆祝会上，发出誓言：“部队打到那里，我们把路修到那里，我们希望到最艰苦的地方，我们要长期参加西藏的建设工作。”
    康北草原上的藏胞们，还深深地记得一九三六年北上抗日的中国工农红军路过这里时，帮助他们组织了博巴政府（按即藏族人民的政府）的历史。现在，藏胞们看到当年的红军更壮大地带着胜利回来了，他们像迎接亲人一样地迎接解放军。解放军进驻康北各地后，经常帮助藏胞挑水、砍柴、割青稞、治病，还不断给藏胞演戏、放电影，举行联欢会。解放军与藏胞之间建立了融洽的军民感情和亲爱的民族感情。因而藏胞们都热烈支援解放军的进军。
