　　Xinhua News Agency, November 28th: TASS, Moscow, November 25th: Pravda recently published an article by its New York correspondent, Lasadin, entitled "War Hysteria and Enterprise," exposing the crimes of American monopoly capitalists, who are obsessed with war profiteering, in creating war terror among the American people.

    Lasadin wrote: Every American shows horror and fear. When you ask Europeans attending the United Nations General Assembly what their impression of the United States is, they usually say that Americans look like frightened, hysterical patients. Recently, there was an electrical fault in the New York subway. Something exploded, and sparks flew. Thousands of people suddenly panicked and fled, shouting "Atomic bomb!" Several people were injured in the chaos and crush.

    Such things are not just accidental. They indicate that the ruling group has incited extremely intense war hysteria. All newspapers and magazines are filled with words like "war" and "bomb." The menacing black shadow of the atomic monster chases Americans on movie screens and television screens. Children in New York schools are subjected to regular "anti-atomic drills." This makes the children timid and provokes protests from parents, but it is even implemented in kindergartens. According to Washington newspapers, the government has allocated millions of dollars to build reserve government buildings outside the city. The issue of moving the US capital into a hole in the ground is also being discussed.

    Simultaneous with inciting war hysteria is the vicious slander propaganda against the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies. Americans are frightened by the fabricated "threat from across the ocean." The U.S. government uses this as an excuse to force through the largest war budget in American history and intensify its attacks on the living standards of the working people. As of October 1, American income tax has increased by another 20 percent. Food prices are increasing daily.

    The Department of Defense cannot hide the number of American soldiers killed and wounded as a result of Wall Street's adventure in Korea. News has appeared saying that the authorities must open seventeen more hospitals to accommodate the soldiers wounded and crippled in the rice paddies of Korea. In the United States, dissatisfaction with the government's war policies is growing daily. Therefore, the agents of monopoly capitalists are intensifying their psychological attacks on the American people.

    The truth about the Soviet Union's peace policy is strictly hidden in the United States. However, anti-Soviet slanderers and enemies of the Soviet Union, such as Matthews and MacArthur, Stassen and Dulles, Eisenhower and Bradley, who occupy ministerial and general positions, have unlimited opportunities to ignite the flames of war hysteria and call for a "preemptive war." Lasadin revealed the source of the war hysteria, saying: Standing behind the hysteria propaganda and preparations for war are the DuPont family and the Morgan family, the Rockefeller family and the Mellon family. In their view, war hysteria is gold. Even according to official, underestimated figures, in the first ten months of this year, American companies received huge profits at an annual rate of no less than 40 billion US dollars. The profits in the first three months after the American intervention in Korea were particularly high. War hysteria is a necessary prerequisite for the war-mongers' bloody enterprise.

    However, Lasadin pointed out: By no means all Americans have been subjected to the influence of militaristic poison gas and atomic hysteria. Many of them understand that there is an effective way to eliminate the threat of atomic war - banning the atomic bomb.

### 美国充满战争歇斯底里  侵略战争使资本家获得庞大利润  对战争政策的不满情绪正在增长

　　美国充满战争歇斯底里
    侵略战争使资本家获得庞大利润  
    对战争政策的不满情绪正在增长
    【新华社二十八日讯】塔斯社莫斯科二十五日讯：真理报顷刊载该报驻纽约记者拉萨丁所撰题为“战争歇斯底里和企业”的专文，揭露醉心于发战争财的美国垄断资本家在美国人民间制造战争恐怖的罪行。
    拉萨丁写道：每个美国人都表现着惊骇和恐惧。当你问到在此参加联合国大会的欧洲人对美国的印象时，通常他们总要说美国人看起来像是受了惊的歇斯底里病人。最近纽约地下铁道发生了一次走电的事情，有什么东西爆裂了，火星四射。成千上万的人们突然惊慌四逃，大喊“原子弹”！有好几个人在慌乱和拥挤中受了伤。
    这样的事情并非只是偶然的。它们表示统治集团煽起了极其紧张的战争歇斯底里。一切报章杂志都充满了“战争”“炸弹”等字样。原子怪物凶恶的黑色暗影，在电影银幕上和电视幕上追逐着美国人。纽约学校的儿童们受着定期的“反原子训练”。这使儿童胆怯并引起家长们的抗议，但甚至还在幼稚园中实施。据华盛顿报纸报道，政府已拨款数百万美元在市区以外建造备用的政府大厦。把美国首都移入地洞的问题也正在讨论中。
    与煽动战争歇斯底里同时进行的，是对苏联及人民民主国家的恶毒诽谤宣传。美国人被捏造的“从大洋那边来的威胁”吓着了。而美国政府就借此强行通过了美国历史上空前庞大的战争预算，加紧进攻着劳动人民的生活标准。十月一日起美国的所得税又增加了百分之二十。食粮价格更与日俱增。
    国防部无法隐瞒美国士兵由于华尔街在朝鲜的冒险而死伤的数目。报纸上出现了这样的消息，说当局必须再开设十七所医院，以便容纳在朝鲜稻田里受伤的和残废的兵士。在美国，政府战争政策所造成的不满情绪正在日益增长。因此，垄断资本家的代理人就对美国人民加紧心理上的进攻。
    苏联和平政策的真相在美国被严密地隐藏起来。但是盘踞在部长和将军职位上的反苏诽谤者和苏联之敌，如马休斯与麦克阿瑟、史塔生与杜勒斯、艾森豪威尔与布莱德雷等人，却有着无限的机会来煽起战争歇斯底里的火焰和号召进行“先发制人的战争”。拉萨丁揭露制造战争歇斯底里的来源称：站在为战争而进行的歇斯底里宣传和准备的后面的，是杜邦家族与摩根家族、洛克菲勒家族和梅隆家族。在他们看来，战争歇斯底里就是黄金。即使根据官方的低估了的数字，在今年前十个月中，美国的公司得到年率不下四百亿美元的庞大利润。美国干涉朝鲜以后的头三个月的利润尤其多。战争歇斯底里是战争贩子们的血腥企业的必要的先决条件。
    但是，拉萨丁指出：绝不是所有美国人都已处在军国主义的毒气和原子歇斯底里的影响之下了。他们当中有许多人懂得：有消除原子战争威胁的有效办法——禁止原子弹。
