Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, November 17th (TASS dispatch): At 7:30 PM on November 16th, the Second World Congress of Supporters of Peace grandly opened in the Polish Language Publishing House in Warsaw, the capital of Poland.

The so-called “Labor” government of Britain, heeding the orders of the U.S. State Department, has made every effort to prevent peace-loving people from around the world from having the opportunity to express their unyielding will for peace and from formulating effective plans to avoid a new world war that the Anglo-American imperialists are attempting to launch. The leaders of the British Labour Party, Attlee and Bevin, disregarding the wishes of the British people, obstructed the convening of the Congress in Sheffield, exposing themselves before all progressive humanity as the sworn enemies of world peace. The British people resolutely condemn the aggressive policies of their government.

However, their sinister plot has been completely defeated. The Polish people, who have experienced the horrors of war, are lovers of freedom. With joy and pride, they offered the peace envoys to gather in their heroic capital, Warsaw. The Polish people welcomed and received hundreds of representatives from all over the world with the greatest enthusiasm.

Representatives from more than seventy countries gathered in the magnificently decorated Polish Language Publishing House. Many of them had to overcome enormous difficulties to attend the Congress and were subjected to police persecution to arrive. Some envoys of the people have not yet arrived in Warsaw. They were blocked by the police cordon specially ordered by the Anglo-American warmongers, who fear the voices of the warriors for peace.

Representatives and guests filled the Congress hall. People from the farthest corners of the earth shook hands with each other, welcoming their comrades who resolutely support the cause of peace.

Representatives from various countries and countless guests welcomed the members of the Permanent Committee of the World Congress of Supporters of Peace with stormy applause. The grand symphony orchestra played Chopin's "Polonaise." Then, Joliot-Curie, Chairman of the Permanent Committee, solemnly announced the opening of the Second World Congress of Supporters of Peace.

Joliot-Curie, on behalf of the Permanent Committee and all the representatives, expressed heartfelt thanks to the Polish government and the Polish Committee of Supporters of Peace for their warm reception of the delegates. He pointed out that the Czechoslovak people also gave the Congress delegates great assistance, providing them with various means of transportation to enable them to reach Warsaw as quickly as possible. Joliot-Curie said, “On behalf of all peace fighters, I would like to especially welcome our British friends and the members of the British Preparatory Committee for the Second World Congress of Supporters of Peace. We greatly admire their spirit in trying to overcome the numerous obstacles placed by the British government to obstruct the convening of the Congress. British friends, we are grateful to you; your efforts have not been in vain. All honest people who believe that peace has unlimited benefits for humanity share your indignation.”

Joliot-Curie continued: "The British government's attempt to obstruct the holding of the Congress did not achieve the results it expected. On the contrary, this attempt has further strengthened the global struggle for peace. No one can stop the victory of the ideas of peace and truth. The convening of the Congress in Poland is another brilliant example proving the great international solidarity and close friendship of all peace fighters in the world."

Albrecht, Chairman of the Presidium of the Warsaw Municipal People's Committee, congratulated the Congress. Albrecht said, "On behalf of the citizens of Warsaw, I pay tribute to the representatives from all countries of the world, the fighters for justice, and the fighters for peace. The convening of the Second Congress takes place at a time when the instigators of a new war are threatening all of civilization, threatening all of humanity that has already experienced the horrors of two world wars. Bombs have already fallen on the cities and villages of the Korean people. But millions of people, regardless of religious belief or political affiliation, are fighting for peace, demanding the prohibition of the atomic bomb. The representatives gathered here reflect their desire for peace.” Albrecht continued: "The British government has exhausted all means in an attempt to prevent the convening of the Congress, but the British government has no power to stifle the voices of millions of peace fighters. This voice is now echoing throughout the world from our capital, Warsaw. We welcome you to this Warsaw that has been devastated by war. Our heroic people are filled with joy at having the honor of hosting the participants of this Congress. The citizens of Warsaw know deeply what war means and understand the significance of the struggle to defend peace. Every inch of Warsaw's soil is soaked with the blood of our children slaughtered by the Hitlerites. Warsaw lost 800,000 women and children. Three-quarters of Warsaw's houses were turned into rubble. The cannibals did not even spare museums, schools, and universities. They destroyed the monuments of Copernicus, Chopin, and other Polish celebrities."

Albrecht continued: "The fraternal Soviet army, which helped us become a free people, gave us assistance. Now Warsaw is being rebuilt. We are building a new city of Warsaw. The Hitlerite murderers wanted to turn Warsaw into a graveyard, but they failed. We built the walls of the new Warsaw, which is a symbol of the victory over war. And now, from the walls of Warsaw, the voices of peace defenders are spreading throughout the world. We, the residents of Warsaw, ardently desire peace and will use all our strength to fight for the victory of peace. Let the voice of the reborn Warsaw be united with your voices. Peace will conquer war!"

The next speaker was Crowther, a British representative and member of the Standing Committee, who thanked the Polish Peace Committee and the entire Polish people on behalf of the Congress delegates for their excellent hospitality to the peace delegates. Crowther said: "The British people are very indignant at the Labor government's obstruction of the Congress in Sheffield. The self-esteem of our nation has been deeply hurt, and the British people's tradition of loving freedom has been destroyed. However, banning the Congress in Sheffield will stimulate the struggle for peace in Britain. The Warsaw Congress will make this struggle more active, and it will help the British people understand the profound meaning of the struggle for peace and then launch a peace movement worthy of our country."

Rafard, a member of the Standing Committee, proposed the agenda of the Congress. The delegates unanimously adopted the following agenda:

(1) Report on the general activities of the peace movement since the First World Congress of Supporters of Peace, and on expanding the peace movement in the face of the increasing threat of war. Reporter: Joliot-Curie.

(2) Report on carrying out extensive activities to prohibit war propaganda, prohibit atomic weapons, achieve universal disarmament, and establish regulatory bodies to supervise the implementation of these measures. Reporter: Nanni.

(3) Election of a new Standing Committee of the World Congress of Supporters of Peace. Then, at Rafard's suggestion, the Congress unanimously decided to establish the following committees:

(1) Political Committee.
(2) Committee on Prohibition of Atomic Weapons, Universal Disarmament, and its Supervision Methods.
(3) Committee on the Prohibition of War Propaganda.
(4) Committee on Establishing Normal International Economic Relations.
(5) Committee on Establishing Normal International Cultural Relations.
(6) Committee on the Definition of the Concept of Aggression.
(7) Organizing Committee.

Montague, a British representative, read to the Congress delegates a letter from Davies, a Labour Party Member of Parliament in the British Parliament:

"Please allow me, on behalf of all the men and women in our country who have noble and upright sentiments, to express indignation and anger at the measures taken by certain people to sabotage your convening of the Congress in Britain. I have clearly seen a sign that those who sabotage the Congress of Supporters of Peace are already suffering the bitter consequences of their actions. More and more anxious British people are beginning to wonder: why is the World Congress of Supporters of Peace actually banned? These questions are neither published nor answered by the British newspapers. But the people themselves will find the answers to these questions, and these answers can inspire the delegates to the Congress. Although I am only an ordinary Member of Parliament, in the past three and a half months, I have received thousands of letters, petitions, and resolutions from individuals, many groups in Britain, individual trade unions, local Labour Party organizations, women, and other groups, including appeals for peace and concerns about the disasters threatening Britain in the event of a third world war. Let me extend sincere congratulations and respect to the delegates who are working with you at the Congress, to the delegates from countries that have broken through centuries of shackles, and to those who are still fighting for freedom and independence. I hope that you will carry out the work of defending peace to the end. Anywhere in the world, even in our country—the government of which recently prevented you from receiving the joyful hospitality of our people—your speeches will arouse powerful resonance in the hearts of millions upon millions of people.”

Then, amid stormy applause, the delegates elected Joliot-Curie as Chairman of the Presidium, and elected Nanni, Lady Gordon, Seyan, Boreson, Bernal, Fadeyev, Cárdenas, Guo Moruo, Dabose, Hotinova-Spurna, Rafard, Deschamblance, Guriaev, Grada, Finolta, Montague, and Bosari as members of the Presidium. In addition, members of the Presidium were elected from representatives of individual countries.

The delegates to the Congress welcomed the representatives of the People's Republic of China and the heroic Democratic People's Republic of Korea with boundless enthusiasm and stormy cheers. They were all elected to the Presidium of the Congress.

After the Presidium was elected, the Congress adjourned until 9:30 AM on the 17th, Warsaw time.

After the first session of the Second World Congress of Supporters of Peace, a press conference was held, where members of the Presidium of the Congress answered questions from reporters.

Fage, Crowther, Bernal, and Dabose stated that despite the enormous difficulties encountered, almost all the Congress delegates had arrived in the Polish capital. Participants in the press conference pointed out that fifteen American delegates, including tireless peace warriors such as Robertson and Fast, had been unable to leave the United States. Of the sixty Brazilian delegates, only four obtained passports, and the Australian government did not issue a single passport.

Crowther pointed out that the British Labor government's refusal to issue entry visas to Congress delegates had aroused such indignation among the British working people that the Home Secretary had been forced to issue a statement, attempting in vain to justify his government's disgraceful actions.

Dabose said: "Representatives of the colonial people had to overcome enormous obstacles to attend the Congress, but they all arrived in Warsaw in time. This proves that peace-loving people have an unyielding will to defend peace and formulate effective programs of struggle."

    谁也阻止不了和平和真理的思想的胜利
    二届世界和大隆重揭幕
    大会一致通过议程选出居里等为主席团
    全场以无限热情与暴风雨般的欢呼欢迎中朝两国代表
    【新华社讯】塔斯社华沙十七日电：十一月十六日十九时三十分，第二届世界保卫和平大会在波兰首都华沙的波兰语出版社大厦隆重揭幕。
    英国的所谓“劳工”政府听从美国国务院的命令，竭力阻挠全世界爱好和平的人民，使他们没有机会表示他们对和平的不屈不挠的意志，没有机会制订避免美英帝国主义者们所企图发动的新的世界大战的有效方案。英国工党的领袖艾德礼和贝文不顾英国人民的愿望，阻挠大会在设菲尔德召开，正好在全体进步人类的眼前，暴露了他们是世界和平死敌的真面目，英国人民是坚决痛斥他们政府的侵略政策的。
    然而他们的罪恶阴谋是彻底地失败了。曾经体验过种种战争恐怖的波兰人民是酷爱自由的，他们怀着愉快与骄傲，向和平使者们建议在他们英雄的首都华沙集会。波兰人民以最大的热诚来欢迎和招待来自全世界各地的千百名代表。
    七十多个国家的代表在装饰辉煌的波兰语出版社大厦里集会了。他们中间有许多人为了要前来出席大会，不得不克服巨大无比的困难，为了要来到大会还要受警察的迫害。有些人民的使节到现在还未能到达华沙。他们被害怕和平战士呼声的美英战争贩子们特地下令设立的警察警戒线拦住了。
    代表与来宾挤满了大会会厅。那些来自地球最辽远的角落的人们彼此愉快地相互握手，欢迎他们的坚决拥护和平事业的战友们。
    各国代表与无数来宾以暴风雨般的掌声欢迎世界保卫和平大会常设委员会的委员们。大交响乐队演奏起萧邦的《波罗奈斯》曲。接着，常设委员会主席约里奥——居里隆重地宣布第二届世界保卫和平大会开幕。
    约里奥——居里代表常设委员会与全体代表对波兰政府与波兰拥护和平委员会给与会代表的热诚招待表示衷心的感谢。他指出：捷克斯洛伐克人民也给予和大代表以巨大的协助，给他们预备各种交通工具以使他们能最快地到达华沙。约里奥——居里说，我代表一切和平战士，要特别在这里欢迎我们的英国朋友与第二届世界保卫和平大会英国筹备委员会的委员们。我们极为钦佩他们努力设法克服英国政府为阻碍和大的召开所加给他们的重重障碍的精神。英国的朋友们，我们是感激你们的，你们的努力并没有白费。凡是认为和平对人类具有无限好处的一切正直的人们都与你们同感愤慨。
    约里奥——居里继续说：英国政府阻挠大会举行的企图，并没有得到它所预期的结果。这种企图反而使全世界的和平斗争更为加强了。谁也阻止不住和平和真理的思想的胜利。大会在波兰召开是又一次的光辉例证，证明全世界一切和平战士们的伟大的国际团结和密切友谊。
    华沙市人民委员会主席团主席阿尔布列齐特向大会致贺。阿尔布列齐特说，我代表华沙市民向全世界各国的代表们，正义事业的斗士们，和平的斗士们致敬。二届大会的召开，正是在新战争的煽动者威胁着整个的文明，威胁着已经历过二次世界大战的恐怖的全体人类的时候。炸弹已落在朝鲜人民的城市村镇了。但数以百万计的人民，不分宗教信仰和政治信仰，正在为和平而斗争，要求禁止原子弹。在这里集会的诸位代表们，反映着他们渴望和平的愿望。阿尔布列齐特继续说：英国政府用尽种种方法，妄图阻止大会的召开，但英国政府却没有力量窒息数百万和平斗士们的呼声。这种呼声，现在正从我国的首都——华沙——响彻全世界。我们欢迎诸位到这一个曾被战争摧毁的华沙来。我国英勇的人民，得有接待这次大会的参与者的光荣，满心快慰。华沙市民深知道战争意味着什么，也了解保卫和平斗争的意义。华沙每一寸土地都浸透着希特勒分子所屠杀的我们子弟的血，华沙曾丧失了八十万的妇女和儿童。华沙市四分之三的房屋都变成了断瓦颓垣，吃人生番们连博物馆，学校和大学也不留，他们摧毁了葛贝尔尼克、萧邦以及其他波兰名人的纪念物。
    阿尔布列齐特继称：帮助我们成为自由人民的亲如兄弟的苏联军队给了我们以援助。现在华沙正在复兴。我们正在建设新的华沙城。希特勒凶手们要把华沙变为坟地，但是他们失败了。我们建筑了新华沙的城墙，这城墙是战胜战争的象征，并且现在从华沙的城墙上，和平保卫者的呼声传遍了全世界。我们华沙居民热烈地渴望和平并且将用我们的全力为争取和平的胜利而斗争。让新生的华沙的声音和你们的呼声汇合在一起。和平将战胜战争！
    下一个发言者是和大常委会委员英国代表克劳瑟，他代表和大代表们向波兰和平委员会及全体波兰人民感谢他们给与和平代表们的优渥的招待。克劳瑟说：英国人民对于工党政府阻挠和大在设菲尔德举行的行为是非常愤慨的。我们民族的自尊心深深地受到伤害，英国人民爱好自由的传统是被破坏了。但是，禁止大会在设菲尔德举行将激励英国的保卫和平的斗争。华沙大会将使这个斗争更积极，它将帮助英国人民了解争取和平斗争的深刻意义并进而展开配得上我们国家的和平运动。
    常委会委员拉斐德提出大会议程，大会代表一致通过了下列议程：
    （一）关于自第一届世界保卫和平大会以来，和平运动一般活动以及在战争威胁日益增长的情况下扩大和平运动的报告，报告人：约里奥——居里。
    （二）关于开展广泛活动禁止战争宣传禁止原子武器普遍裁减军备及建立管制机构监督执行这些措施的办法的报告，报告人：南尼。
    （三）选举世界保卫和平大会新的常设委员会。接着大会根据拉斐德的建议，一致决定设立下列各委员会：
    （一）政治委员会。
    （二）禁止原子武器、普遍裁减军备及其监督办法委员会。
    （三）禁止战争宣传问题委员会。
    （四）建立国际正常经济关系问题委员会。
    （五）建立国际正常文化关系问题委员会。
    （六）侵略概念定义委员会。
    （七）组织委员会。
    英国代表蒙塔古向大会代表宣读英国议会工党议员戴维斯的来信：
    “请容许我代表我国一切有着高尚和正直的情操的男女们，对某些人所采取的破坏你们在英国召开大会的措施，表示愤慨和激怒。我已清楚地看到一种迹象，那些破坏保卫和平大会的人们，已经在自食自己行动的苦果了。感到焦急的英国人民越来越多，他们开始发生了疑问：为什么世界保卫和平大会实际上被禁止了呢？这些问题是英国报纸既没有发表、也不会给予答复的。但人民自己将会发现这些问题的答案，这些答案是能够鼓舞大会诸位代表的。虽然我只是一名平凡的普通议员，在过去三个半月内，却曾收到来自个人、英国的许多团体、个别的工会、工党地方组织、妇女与其他各种团体的数以千计的信件、请愿书与决议案，其中包括有争取和平的呼吁，及对发生第三次世界大战时威胁着英国的灾难的忧虑。让我向和你们共同参加大会工作的代表们，向来自己经打破了百年来的桎梏的国家的代表们，向那些仍在进行着争取自由与独立的斗争的代表们致热诚的祝贺与敬意。希望你们把保卫和平的工作进行到底。在全世界的任何地方，甚至在我们的国家——这个国家的政府最近阻碍了你们接受我国人民欢忭的款待——你们的演说都将在千千万万人民的心里，唤起有力的共鸣。”
    接着大会代表们在暴风雨般的掌声中，选出约里奥——居里为主席团主席，并选出南尼、戈登夫人、赛扬、鲍埃逊、贝尔纳、法捷耶夫、卡德纳斯、郭沫若、达波赛、荷第诺娃——斯普尔纳、拉斐德、德香布兰、顾里亚耶夫、葛拉达、芬诺尔塔、蒙塔古和波萨里为主席团。此外并从各别国家的代表中选出了主席团委员。
    大会代表们以无限的热情与暴风雨般的欢呼欢迎中华人民共和国和英勇的朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的代表，他们都被选入大会主席团。
    主席团选出后，大会宣布休会至华沙时间十七日九点三十分。
    第二届世界保卫和平大会第一次会议结束后，举行招待记者会，大会主席团委员在会上答复记者提出的问题。
    法奇、克劳瑟、贝尔纳、达波赛宣称：尽管遭遇了巨大的困难，但是几乎所有的大会代表都已抵达波兰的首都。参加招待记者会的人们指出：包括罗伯逊、法斯特等不倦的和平战士在内的十五位美国代表未能离开美国，在六十位巴西代表中只有四人取得护照，澳大利亚政府没有发出一张护照。
    克劳瑟指出：英国工党政府拒发入境签证给大会代表，已在英国劳动人民中激起这样的愤慨，内政大臣不得不被迫发表声明，徒劳无益地企图为他的政府的可耻行为辩解。
    达波赛说：殖民地人民的代表们要出席大会就必须克服巨大的障碍，但是他们全都及时地到达了华沙。这证明爱好和平的人民具有不屈不挠的意志，来保卫和平并制订有效的斗争纲领。
