Central People's Government Publishing Administration Announces
Five Resolutions of the First National Publishing Conference on Improving and Developing National Publishing Undertakings

I. Resolution on the Basic Policy of Developing People's Publishing Undertakings

After listening to the report "On People's Publishing Undertakings and Their Development Direction" made by Hu Yuzhi, Director of the Central People's Government Publishing Administration, at the conference, the First National Publishing Conference unanimously agreed with the basic policy on developing people's publishing undertakings proposed in the report.

The conference believes that the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference is the principle we unanimously abide by; serving the interests of the people is the basic policy of the people's publishing undertaking. The new China's people's publishing undertaking must conscientiously implement the national, scientific, and mass cultural education policy, and resolutely fight against feudal, comprador, and fascist ideologies. In order to realize this basic policy, the publishing undertaking must adapt to the times and local conditions, and combine with the actual needs of the people.

The conference believes that the victory of the Chinese People's Great Revolution has opened up unlimited prospects for the publishing undertaking. In order to adapt to the needs of national construction and the cultural life requirements of the broad masses of people, all public and private publishing, printing, and distribution industries in the country must unite and work together.

The conference believes that some of the current difficulties in the publishing undertaking are temporary and can be overcome. To overcome the current difficulties, we must eliminate the state of no planning and no organization, and realize specialization and planning in accordance with the policy of overall consideration and division of labor and cooperation.

The conference guarantees that under the leadership of the Central People's Government Publishing Administration, we will work together and strive to implement the above policies.

II. Resolution on Improving and Developing Publishing Work

1. Article 41 of the Common Program stipulates: "The culture and education of the People's Republic of China shall be new-democratic, that is, national, scientific, and mass culture and education. The main tasks of the people's government's cultural and educational work should be to raise the people's cultural level, train talents for national construction, eliminate feudal, comprador, and fascist ideologies, and develop ideas that serve the people." Article 49 stipulates: "Develop the people's publishing undertaking, and pay attention to publishing popular books and newspapers that are beneficial to the people." Public and private publishing institutions should conscientiously implement such policies.

2. Due to historical and other reasons, there are still quite serious phenomena of no planning and no organization in the publishing industry. In order to eliminate this phenomenon, both public and private publishing industries should strive to create conditions and gradually implement the policy of separating publishing from distribution, separating publishing from printing, and specializing in publishing, and under the unified leadership of the Publishing Administration, make overall plans and division of labor and cooperation.

3. In order to concentrate efforts and do a good job in publishing work, publishing institutions should gradually get rid of distribution and printing work, and entrust the tasks of distribution and printing to specialized public and private distribution institutions and printing institutions. However, publishing institutions that publish certain special and specialized books and periodicals may also concurrently engage in distribution or printing work when necessary.

4. Public and private publishing institutions should formulate relatively long-term and feasible plans within a certain period. The plan should specify the direction of specialization, the types and quantities of publications, etc. This plan should be submitted to the Publishing Administration and local publishing administrative agencies for overall consideration. The situation of the plan report should be checked regularly, and a report should be made and submitted in the same way.

5. In order to supply the needs of national construction in various aspects and meet the requirements of the people's cultural life in various aspects, the types of publications should be expanded, and all categories and types of books and periodicals in social sciences, natural sciences, literature and art should be fully supplied, while also paying attention to the gradual improvement in quality.

6. In order to cooperate with the literacy education and cultural and political education of workers, peasants, and soldiers, various popular books and periodicals should be published in large quantities, including spare-time textbooks, political common sense, production knowledge, scientific knowledge, life common sense, literary works, etc. Popular books and periodicals should pay attention to the readers' acceptance level, and gradually improve on the basis of popularization. Old forms should be used appropriately and new forms should be created. Central and local People's Publishing Houses should also do a good job in popular publicity and explanation of government policies and regulations. Children's books and women's books should also be published in large quantities.

7. In order to cooperate with national economic construction, the publication of books and periodicals related to finance and economics, and applied technology must be increased. On the one hand, attention should be paid to relatively popular books and periodicals to meet the needs of training a large number of basic construction talents. On the other hand, more specialized works should also be published to meet the needs of training senior construction talents. Specialized works that are too long and do not sell well will be assisted by the government for publication.

8. Pay attention to the publication of books and periodicals in various ethnic languages. When conditions permit, publishing institutions in various ethnic languages should also be established.

9. In order to meet the needs of economic construction and cultural construction in various regions of the country, public and private local publishing institutions should be established and developed in a planned manner to publish local books and periodicals.

10. Public and private publishing institutions should strengthen the work of editing and reviewing, set up editing and reviewing departments as much as possible, and employ editors and proofreaders with a certain level of political culture and technical skills to be responsible for the work of reviewing and proofreading. Those who have difficulty in setting up an editing and reviewing department alone may jointly set up one with the same industry.

11. Publishing institutions should actively contact writers in a certain direction to organize manuscripts. Those whose professional direction has been clarified can contact the relevant government departments and people's organizations or accept their leadership with the assistance of the Publishing Administration and local publishing administrative agencies.

12. The method of remuneration for manuscripts should be decided through consultation with the author, taking into account the interests of the author, the reader, and the publisher; in order to respect the rights and benefits of the author, the method of selling the copyright outright should not be adopted in principle. The standard for calculating remuneration for manuscripts should be based on the nature, quality, word count, and number of copies of the work in principle.

13. The management costs of publishing institutions should be reduced reasonably, and their profits should be maintained at a reasonable level, so as to achieve the goal of gradually reducing book prices. Book prices should strive to change the basic pricing system to a monetary pricing system.

14. Publishing institutions should establish close contact with the reading community, libraries, the press, and book review publications, and listen to opinions from all parties in order to revise errors and improve work.

15. Publications should have a preface, foreword, or other text as much as possible to introduce the content and version information, and the author's and translator's information to readers. On the copyright page, the time of the first edition and reprint, the number of copies printed, the names of the author and translator, and the original title of the translated version should be faithfully recorded. In the reprint, the author should be contacted as much as possible for necessary revisions. Proofreading should be as careful as possible to reduce or eliminate technical errors.

16. Pay attention to the binding, layout, and illustrations of publications, so that the form matches the content. For children's books, special attention should be paid to appropriate fonts and clear printing to protect the readers' eyesight.

17. The publishing industry should respect copyright and publishing rights, and there should be no acts of duplication, plagiarism, or tampering.

18. Public and private publishing industries in various places should establish regular organizations, hold regular meetings or forums, and establish contact with local publishing administrative agencies in order to exchange opinions and work experience, and adjust publishing plans.

19. Public and private publishing industries in various places should jointly or separately hold cadre training, and ask the Publishing Administration to plan to establish a publishing specialized school to train and improve publishing cadres.

III. Resolution on Improving and Developing Book and Periodical Distribution Work

1. Book and periodical distribution is extremely important work related to the people's cultural life and national cultural construction. To do a good job in distribution, we must develop a high degree of responsibility and service spirit, and oppose the purely profit-seeking viewpoint and the idea of ​​underestimating distribution work.

2. All books and periodicals that are beneficial to the people and needed by the people should be sold. Those with positive educational significance and major application value should be promoted with particular efforts.

3. Attach importance to the publicity work of books and periodicals, and honestly recommend excellent readings to readers. At the same time, readers' opinions and distribution conditions should be reflected to publishing institutions at any time, so that publishing work can be combined with the actual needs of readers.

4. In order to enable the people's publications to penetrate into the masses, we must unite all public, public-private joint venture and private distribution workers (including book stalls, book vendors, post offices, cooperatives, etc.), organize a vast and complete distribution network throughout the country, and use various methods (including the method of mobile supply) to send books and periodicals into factories, mines, rural areas, troops, organs, schools, and into the areas where various ethnic groups live in the country. At the same time, we should also carry out distribution business to overseas Chinese and foreign people.

5. Assist factories, mines, rural areas, troops, organs, and schools to establish libraries, reading rooms, reading clubs, book and newspaper supply stations, etc., to carry out reading activities. Public and private distribution institutions should jointly undertake this task.

6. Adjust the public-private relationship in the distribution industry. According to the specific situation, conduct appropriate division of labor, and try to avoid the waste of strength. Sort out the old inter-industry relations. Open up new distribution routes.

7. Under the principle of reducing the burden on readers and maintaining reasonable profits, we agree on purchase, wholesale conditions and preferential methods in the spirit of equality and mutual benefit, and uniformly stipulate cheap methods for important anniversaries.

8. Improve business operations, reduce operating expenses, and gradually reduce the selling price of books and periodicals; strive to gradually unify the selling price of books and periodicals across the country to reduce the burden on readers in remote areas.

9. Strengthen and enrich the industry association, so that it becomes a group that unites each other, learns from each other, guarantees the implementation of government decrees, and protects the legitimate interests of the industry. Public and private distribution institutions should participate in the industry association.

10. Public and private distribution institutions in various places should jointly or separately hold various seminars or study sessions to improve the political, cultural, and professional level of employees and all employees.

IV. Resolution on Improving Periodical Work

1. Periodicals are one of the powerful weapons for educating, uniting, and organizing the masses. Various periodicals should gradually achieve professional division of labor according to their nature and target readers, so as to eliminate the existing phenomena of repetition and confusion. Periodicals of the same nature can negotiate division of labor, joint venture, or merger, etc. on a voluntary basis.

2. A large number of popular periodicals of various natures should be increased to cooperate with the literacy education and cultural, political, and technical education of workers, peasants, and soldiers. In multi-ethnic areas, pay attention to publishing periodicals in various ethnic languages.

3. Public and private periodicals should strive to operate as enterprises and make prices reasonable.

4. As much as possible, enrich the editorial department of periodicals so that they can grasp policies, contact reality, unite readers and authors, and constantly study the readers' situation in order to formulate editorial plans and actively organize manuscripts.

5. Periodicals in the same region or with similar natures should establish or strengthen various forms of contact as much as possible to exchange experiences, exchange manuscripts, and obtain assistance from relevant agencies and groups.

6. All public and private distribution institutions should attach importance to the distribution work of periodicals and actively promote public and private periodicals. The distribution power of the post office should be fully utilized.

V. Resolution on Improving the Book and Periodical Printing Industry

1. The book and periodical printing industry should cooperate with the entire publishing industry and gradually embark on the road of planning and specialization under the policy of "overall consideration, division of labor and cooperation."

2. Due to historical reasons, the printing industry is still facing difficulties. More than one-third of the printing presses have no work to do, resulting in the phenomenon of partial factory shutdowns, production reductions, and worker unemployment. However, in the future, the national economy and culture will gradually develop, and the number of publications must gradually increase. In order to overcome the current difficulties and welcome the future improvement:

1. Public and private printing industries should assist the government and trade unions to focus on providing relief or resettlement for unemployed workers. Private printing factories should strive to maintain and improve the operation of the business through labor-capital consultation;

2. Public and private printing factories should not expand blindly;

3. It is recommended that agencies and groups generally should not build new factories themselves, and their printed materials can be handed over to existing public and private printing factories for printing;

4. Public and private printing factories should avoid business competition and squeeze in the spirit of overall consideration;

5. Private small printing factories should be merged into larger joint-stock companies according to their performance and specifications on a voluntary basis, and carry out production in a planned and step-by-step manner to meet actual needs. Public printing factories should also make appropriate adjustments to meet the needs.

3. In the past, my country's printing machines were all imported from various countries, with inconsistent specifications and mostly old and unusable for a long time. We should immediately plan to make them ourselves. Other printing materials, such as copper molds, inks, phototypesetting equipment, and thin paper, should also be researched and improved.

4. Public and private printing industries in various places should strengthen industry associations, and frequently hold meetings or forums to establish contact with publishing administrative agencies and the publishing industry in order to exchange opinions and work experience, and improve technical standards and product quality.

5. In order to meet the needs of the development of the printing industry, it is recommended that relevant government departments prepare to establish printing specialized schools to train and improve technical cadres.
