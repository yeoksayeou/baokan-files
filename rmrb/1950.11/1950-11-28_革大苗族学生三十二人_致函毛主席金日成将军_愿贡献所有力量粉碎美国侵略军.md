　　Revolutionary University Miao Students (32 People)
    Send Letters to Chairman Mao and General Kim Il-sung
    Willing to Contribute All Their Strength to Crush American Aggressors
    [Our Newspaper] Thirty-two Miao students from the North China People's Revolutionary University, including You Deyou, Deng Dejin, Man Yihu, Zhou Deyuan, Sun Zhenzhong, Zhuang Yungui, Deng Shouwen, Xiang Xiusheng, Lü Daoyuan, Zhang Furong, Huang Sixiao, Luo Xinghua, Wu Dizhi, Yu Zhongtao, Peng Xirong, Tang Yaoming, Huang Shuyun, Huang Jichuan, Zhu Yikui, Yang Pingrui, Yang Zhongwei, Xiao Shangren, Zhang Shiming, Liu Jingwen, Lü Ruomei, Tian Renli, Wang Zilian, Chen Caixian, Dai Siwen, Liu Zhuangtao, Zhou Hongyuan, and Han Zhenghua, sent letters of respect to Chairman Mao and General Kim Il-sung, expressing their determination to resist America and aid Korea. In their letter to Chairman Mao, they said: "The aggressive bloc headed by American imperialism is frantically attacking the world's people's camp of peace and democracy. American imperialism attempts to destroy the growth and strength of New China, attempts to destroy the rebirth of the Korean people, launched a war of aggression in Korea, and extended the flames of war to our northeastern border, directly invading our territory of Taiwan and bombing our northeastern people. These brutal atrocities of American imperialism have aroused our anger. Korea is our neighbor, and we share weal and woe. The suffering of the Korean people is also our suffering, and we cannot sit idly by while our neighbor Korea is subjected to aggression. We cannot allow American imperialism to invade even an inch of our sacred territory. Today, the time has come for us to take practical action to strike at the American imperialist aggressors. In order to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend our country, all thirty-two Miao youths of the North China People's Revolutionary University solemnly swear to join the volunteer army and are willing to contribute all our strength to wage a resolute struggle against the aggressive bloc headed by American imperialism."
    In their letter to General Kim Il-sung, they said: "We are extremely angry at American imperialism's launching of a war of aggression on your land and its various brutal atrocities. We not only extend our warm sympathy but are also willing to support you with practical actions and fight alongside your heroic Korean People's Liberation fighters. Today, the entire Chinese people have launched a high tide of organizing a volunteer army to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend our country. We Miao youths studying in Beijing have made a solemn oath to join the volunteer army to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend our country. We hope that in the near future, we will be able to rush to your sacred land and, under your command, quickly defeat the American aggressors. We are not afraid of any sacrifice. We are willing to shed our blood on your land and cultivate a flower of freedom and peace, so that it will live forever in the hearts of the people of the world."
