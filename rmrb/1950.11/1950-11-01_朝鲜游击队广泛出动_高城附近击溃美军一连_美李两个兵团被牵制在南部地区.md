Xinhua News Agency, 31st — As the invading American army advancing north is encountering increasingly strong resistance from the Korean People's Army, the Korean People's Guerrilla units are also widely active behind enemy lines, actively striking the enemy. According to a report from a U.S. Associated Press correspondent from the northeastern Korean front on the 28th: One thousand North Koreans ambushed a company of U.S. Marines around Goseong (north of Yangyang on the east coast) on the morning of the 28th, "effectively scattering the company completely." The 2nd Battalion of Marines, rushed south from Wonsan to reinforce them, was also forced to retreat on the same day at noon. Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, reported on the 29th, acknowledging that the high ground near Goseong "is now controlled by well-equipped and powerful guerrillas."

In South Korea, the Korean People's Guerrilla units are fighting stubbornly and pinning down a large number of enemy troops. According to an Agence France-Presse dispatch from Washington on the 29th, quoting a U.S. Department of Defense spokesman: "Tenacious guerrilla warfare has broken out in the U.S. rear south of the 38th parallel in Korea, and it has already pinned down two corps." These two corps are the ROK 3rd Corps, composed of the ROK 11th Division and the anti-guerrilla First Team, and the U.S. 9th Corps, composed of the U.S. 25th Infantry Division and various assault teams. A United Press dispatch from Seoul on the 28th, while describing the situation of the guerrilla war in South Korea, sadly admitted that the Korean People's Guerrilla units "may cause a lot of trouble in the coming months." The dispatch continued: The South Korean guerrillas "are hiding in some of the most rugged and inaccessible areas, often appearing around Daegu, and launching frequent threats," and the U.S. and Rhee gangs send troops to "suppress" them each time, "returning empty-handed." As soon as the U.S. troops leave, they come back to "continue harassing," and "coastal villages such as Samcheok have been captured by them several times."

　　朝鲜游击队广泛出动
    高城附近击溃美军一连
    美李两个兵团被牵制在南部地区
    【新华社三十一日讯】在北犯的美国侵略军正遭遇朝鲜人民军日益坚强的抵抗之际，朝鲜人民游击部队亦同时在敌后广泛出动，积极打击敌人。据美联社随军记者二十八日自朝鲜东北前线所发消息称：一千名北朝鲜人二十八日清晨从高城（按在东海岸襄阳以北）四周伏击美军陆战队一连，“实际上已将该连完全击散”。急自元山南驰增援的陆战队第二营，亦于同日午间被击缩回。法新社东京二十九日电承认：高城附近数据点“现为装备优良的强大游击队掌握着”。
    在南朝鲜，朝鲜人民游击部队正顽强地作战，并牵制了大量敌军兵力。据法新社华盛顿二十九日电引美国防部发言人谈话称：“朝鲜三八线以南的美军后方，已发生顽强的游击战，刻已牵制了两个兵团。”这两个兵团为以南朝鲜伪军第十一师及反游击队第一队组成的伪军第三兵团，与以美第二十五步兵师及各种突击队组成的美国第九兵团。合众社汉城二十八日电在描述南朝鲜游击战争的情况时悲哀地承认，朝鲜人民游击队“在今后很多月中，可能制造不少麻烦”。该电继称：南朝鲜游击队“藏匿在若干最峻险难及的地带，常在大邱四周出没，经常发动威胁”，而美、李匪帮每次派往“清剿”的部队，“都是空手而回”。待美军一走，他们又回来“继续骚扰”，“沿海村落如三涉等，曾几度为他们攻陷”。
