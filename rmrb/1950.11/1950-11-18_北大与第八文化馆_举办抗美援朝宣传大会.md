Peking University and the Eighth Cultural Center
    Hold Anti-American Aggression and Aid Korea Propaganda Meeting

    [Reported by this newspaper] On the afternoon of the 16th, the Peking University Anti-American Aggression Committee and the Eighth Cultural Center jointly held an anti-American aggression and aid Korea, defend the home and defend the country propaganda meeting in the square of the newly built glass factory outside Chongwenmen. Some students from the Departments of Sand Industry, Sand Medicine, and the Drama Club were responsible for the propaganda work. More than 4,300 citizens, young and old, attended.

    Peking University students had previously understood the ideological situation of the citizens, so they quickly carried cartoon boards and explained to them why American imperialism is a paper tiger, why atomic bombs are not scary, and why the "Korean sticks" are the Li Seung-man bandit gang, etc. The villagers, especially the elderly women, found some of the students' accents difficult to understand, but they still softly stopped the children from making noise and listened attentively to every word. They nodded from time to time and said, "American imperialism is really hateful!" "As long as we Chinese are united, we are not afraid of anything."

    When the program began, everyone watched the crimes of the American imperialists and special agents with rapt attention, and flames of anger ignited from the bottom of their hearts. After "Blood Debt Must Be Paid with Blood" was performed, Bao Puyi, a clerk from a pharmacy, jumped onto the stage and said: "American imperialism is the most hateful! They drive rickshaws and cars in Beijing, rushing around and killing people without paying for their lives. They don't treat us Chinese as human beings! Today, we Chinese have stood up, and they are coming to bully us again. These blood debts must be paid in blood!" Worker Han Zhaozheng said: "I used to see American soldiers bullying women in Dongdan, and I was very angry, but I didn't know what to do. Because the police of the Kuomintang bandits saw it next to them and didn't dare to do anything. We suffered grievances and had nowhere to complain. Now I understand that our People's Government is not afraid of any imperialism, and our people are not afraid of them either. American imperialism is now coming to bully us again, so we will settle the accounts with them." An old lady living in the Temple of the Sleeping Buddha said: "I used to see American soldiers beating people on the street at will, and no one dared to hit them; cars ran over people like they were crushing dogs, paying ten yuan for an adult and five yuan for a child. It's outrageous! American imperialism has invaded again, we must drive it away, otherwise, we will become slaves of a subjugated nation again, and they will bully us as fiercely as the Japanese devils!"

　　北大与第八文化馆
    举办抗美援朝宣传大会
    【本报讯】十六日下午三时，北大反美侵略委员会与第八文化馆在崇文门外新建玻璃厂广场，联合举办了抗美援朝保家卫国宣传大会。由部分沙工、沙医及剧艺社的同学担任宣传工作。市民们扶老携幼出席的有四千三百余人。
    北大同学事先曾了解过市民的思想情况，所以很快就背着漫画牌，向他们讲解为什么美帝是纸老虎，为什么原子弹不可怕，为什么“高丽棒子”就是李承晚匪帮等问题。老乡们，尤其是老大娘们对有些同学的口音觉得不大好懂，但她们仍轻声制止孩子们的嚷声，用心倾听每一个字句。不时地点着头说：“美帝真可恨！”“咱们中国人只要齐心，什么都不怕。”
    节目开始了，大家都聚精会神地看着美帝和特务们的罪行，从心底燃起愤怒的火焰。在“血债血还”演完以后，一位药行店员宝普义跳上台去说：“美帝国主义是最可恶的！他们在北京打蹬三轮的，开起汽车横冲直闯，轧死人不偿命，那把我们中国人当人看啊！今天咱们中国人站起来了，它又来欺侮我们，这些血债都要用血来还清的！”工人韩召正说：“我以前在东单看见美军欺侮女人，心里很气愤，但是不知道怎么办。因为国民党匪帮的警察在旁边看到了也不敢管，我们受了气没有地方伸冤。现在我懂了，我们人民政府不怕任何帝国主义，我们人民也不怕他们。美帝现在又来欺侮咱们，咱们就和他算总帐。”一位住在卧佛寺的老太太说：“以前我看见美帝兵士，在街上乱打人，而没有人敢打他们；汽车轧死人也像压死狗一样，大人赔十元，轧死小人赔五元。简直不成话！美帝国主义又来侵略了，我们一定要把它赶走，不然，我们又将要做亡国奴，它们就会像日本鬼子一样凶狠地来欺压我们了！”
