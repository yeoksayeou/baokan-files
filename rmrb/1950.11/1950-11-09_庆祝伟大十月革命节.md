　　Celebrating the Great October Revolution Day
    Learn from the Soviet Big Brother
    Intensify Production to Defend the Homeland
    Qiu Ronggui, Model Worker of the Subei Rice Mill
    The Soviet Union is our Big Brother and a powerful fortress for world peace. Today, thirty-three years ago—the October Revolution Day—is a day of glorious historical significance. After the success of the Soviet Revolution, the new proletarian regime announced to China the abolition of the unequal treaties concluded by the Tsarist government that oppressed China. Since the success of the October Socialist Revolution, the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union have established an unbreakable friendship. This time, when I attended the National Model Workers Representative Conference, I saw the Soviet Ambassador to our country, Roshchin. His warm attitude fully demonstrated brotherly love and the great spirit of internationalism. Soviet friends have provided great assistance to the Chinese people in politics, culture, and science and technology. They are truly our Big Brother, and we should learn from them and emulate them. In the future, we are determined to intensify production, resist America and aid Korea, and defend our homeland. We will commemorate the October Revolution Day with practical actions, actively support the Chinese People's Liberation Army in liberating Taiwan, and defeat the insane aggressive atrocities of American imperialism.
    Thoughts on the 33rd Anniversary of the Great October Revolution
    Li Yong, Driver of the "Mao Zedong" Locomotive
    The great October Revolution Day has arrived, and peace-loving people all over the world are rejoicing. Because of the victory of the October Revolution, the fascist aggressors were thoroughly defeated, and the world's first socialist country, the Soviet Union, emerged. Thanks to the leadership and assistance of the Soviet Union, the world's peace and democracy camp is growing stronger, while the imperialists are gradually moving towards their demise!
    Our Chinese people's victory, our current free and happy life, are inseparable from the brotherly friendship and help of the Soviet Union. Remembering the source when drinking water, on this great October Revolution Day, we express our deep gratitude to the Soviet Union and the great mentor of mankind, Marshal Stalin!
    Now the war-mongers of American imperialism are instigating and launching wars. All peace-loving people in the world are consciously uniting, supporting the world peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union, and standing on the side of the Soviet Union. We will forever follow the Soviet Union, unite into an iron force, resist the aggression of the imperialists, and strive for peace and freedom!
    Celebrating the October Revolution and Opposing American Imperialist Aggression
    Li Yonglu, Industrial Model
    All 475 million compatriots in China: come and see! Thirty-three years ago, a powerful and radiant light appeared on one-sixth of the world's land, and these rays shone on every peace-loving person. This is the victorious light of the Great October Revolution in the socialist country of the Soviet Union.
    I am always grateful to Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin. They are our pioneers and our advanced teachers. Thanks to their ideological leadership, the October Revolution took place in the Soviet Union, and the fascist aggressors were quickly driven away, opening up a new path in the face of difficulties. Without them, China would never have achieved today's liberation, and we would not know how many years we would have suffered under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, nor how many years we would have been slaves.
    Now, China has been liberated for almost two years, and the People's Republic of China has been established for one year. Now our crew members in various sections can thoroughly study the system of responsibility for contracted trains, and the workers in the factories are working hard to implement it. When new reforms are being carried out on a large scale under the education and assistance of Soviet experts, the war-mongers of American imperialism launched a new war of aggression in Korea, and the US imperialists intend to follow the old path of Japanese aggression against our country. But as long as there is solid unity and cooperation between China and the Soviet Union, they will definitely not succeed.
    I believe there are three main reasons why American imperialism is bound to fail:
    ① The battle line is stretched too long, and it cannot win.
    ② All the troops are at the front, and the rear is empty.
    ③ The soldiers fundamentally do not want to fight, so they will be defeated.
    Therefore, we must take the Soviet Big Brother as our teacher and produce well in the rear to support the fight against the American imperialists.
    In addition, I guarantee to raise the spirit I had when I was the driver in 1939, work diligently on the front lines, and overcome more difficulties to celebrate the 33rd anniversary of the October Revolution.
    Celebrating the October Revolution Day
    Ren Qingshan, Industrial Model Worker
    The great October Revolution in the Soviet Union opened the door to the liberation of the working class. Since then, it has pointed out the direction of revolution for the working class all over the world and strengthened our working class's will to fight. The October Revolution brought the dawn of victory to the oppressed people. Following this victorious example, our Chinese working class, after nearly 30 years of struggle, has overthrown the reactionary Kuomintang, and the people will never be oppressed again. The people of China and the Soviet Union have a deep historical friendship. The Soviet Union helped us defeat Japan and gave us great support in the domestic liberation war. Especially after our victory, it gave us the greatest help in economic construction, enabling us to make rapid progress in industry and agriculture. The people's lives are not only guaranteed, but have also improved. In the future, our two great democratic countries, China and the Soviet Union, must be more united and more friendly, and strive to eliminate our common enemy who is invading us as soon as possible.

　　庆祝伟大十月革命节
    向苏联老大哥学习
    加紧生产保家卫国
    苏北机米厂劳模  邱荣贵
    苏联是我们的老大哥，也是世界保卫和平的强大堡垒。三十三年前的今天—十月革命节，这是具有光辉历史意义的节日。苏维埃革命成功后，新的无产阶级政权即对中国宣布废除沙皇政府压迫中国所缔结的不平等的条约，自十月社会主义革命成功后，中苏两大民族即开始建立了牢不可破的友谊。这次，我出席全国劳模代表会议，看见了苏联驻我国大使罗申，他那亲热的样子充分的表现了兄弟友爱、伟大的国际主义精神。苏联友人对中国人民无论在政治上、文化上、科学技术上，都有很大的帮助，它真正是我们的老大哥，我们应当向它学习，向它看齐。今后，我们决心加紧生产，抗美援朝，保卫家国。以实际行动来纪念十月革命节日，积极支援中国人民解放军解放台湾，打败美帝国主义的疯狂侵略暴行。
    伟大的十月革命节三十三周年纪念感想
    毛泽东号机车司机长  李永
    伟大的十月革命节到来了，全世界爱好和平的人们都在欢欣鼓舞。因为由于十月革命的胜利，彻底的打击了法西斯侵略者，出现了世界上第一个社会主义国家苏联；由于苏联的领导帮助，使世界和平民主阵营日渐壮大，而帝国主义者日渐走上死亡的道路！
    我们中国人民的胜利，我们现在的自由幸福的生活，是与苏联友邦对于我国兄弟般的友谊和帮助分不开的。饮水思源，在这伟大的十月革命节日，我们对苏联及伟大的人类导师斯大林大元帅，表示深忱的感谢！
    现在美帝国主义的战争贩子们，正在挑拨着发动战争，世界上所有爱好和平的人们都自动自觉地团结起来，拥护以苏联为首的世界和平民主阵营，站在苏联这一边。永远跟着苏联走，团结成铁的力量，反抗帝国主义者的侵略，争取和平！争取自由！
    庆祝十月革命反对美帝侵略
    工业模范  李永禄
    全中国四万七千五百万同胞们：你们来看看吧！在三十三年以前，就在全世界六分之一的土地上出现了强大的万丈光芒，这些光芒射到我们每个爱好和平人们的身上。这就是伟大的社会主义国家苏联十月革命获得到的胜利光芒。
    我时刻在感谢着马、恩、列、斯四位同志，他们是我们的开路先锋，还是我们的先进导师。多亏有他们的思想领导，在苏联才产生了十月革命，很快地打跑了法西斯侵略者，在困难中开辟了一条新的大道。如果没有他们的话，我们中国绝不会得到今天的解放，还不知要受国民党反动统治多少年的压迫呢，也不知要当多少年的奴隶呢。
    现在的中国解放将至两年，我中华人民共和国成立已一周年了，现在我们各个段的乘务员，都能彻底学习包乘负责制，工厂工友都在努力执行。在苏联专家的教育和帮助下，正在大规模实行新的改革的时候，美帝国主义战争贩子们却在朝鲜发动了新的侵略战争，美帝打算走日本侵略我国的老路。但是只要有中苏巩固团结与合作，那他绝对是不能成功的。
    我认为美帝必败的主要原因有三个：
    ①战线拉的过长，他打不胜。
    ②兵力全部到前方，后方就空虚。
    ③根本兵士都是不愿打仗的，所以就会打败。
    因此，我们要以苏联老大哥为师，在后方好好生产，支援打美帝。
    此外，我保证把在一九三九年担任司机长时的精神更提高起来，勤下现场，多克服困难，来庆祝十月革命节三十三周年。
    庆祝十月革命节
    工业劳模  任庆山
    苏联伟大的十月革命，打开了工人阶级解放的大门。从此给全世界上工人阶级指明革命的方向，增强了我们工人阶级的斗争意志。十月革命给被压迫的人民带来了胜利的曙光，我们中国工人阶级本着这个胜利的榜样，经过近三十年的斗争，把反动的国民党已经推翻了，人民永远再不会受压迫了。中苏两国人民有着历史上深厚的友谊。苏联帮助我们打败了日本，在国内解放战争中又给了我们很大的声援。特别是我们胜利后，在经济建设上给了我们最大的帮助，使得我们在工业上、农业上得到了很快的进步。人民的生活不光有了保证，而且已提高了。今后我们中苏两大民主国家，要更加团结更加友好，为争取早日干净地消灭侵略我们的共同的敌人而奋斗。
