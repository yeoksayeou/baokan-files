　　Look at the Demise of German Fascism!
    ——An Introduction to "The Fall of Berlin" (Part 2)
    The Technicolor epic "The Fall of Berlin" will soon be screened during the October Revolution anniversary. This is a joyous event. This film is the most outstanding film in the Soviet film industry and has won the Stalin Prize and the Special Prize at the 1950 Czech International Film Festival.
    "The Fall of Berlin" is a film with high artistic value. Through the fates of Aleksey Ivanov and Natasha Rumyantseva, two ordinary Soviet people, it depicts the entire history of the Soviet Patriotic War: from the treacherous German invasion of the Soviet Union, to the Battle of Moscow, the turning point of the Great Patriotic War, the Battle of Stalingrad, the meeting of the Don Front and the Stalingrad Front in the snow, the Soviet Union's transition to a powerful full-scale offensive, and finally, the direct attack on the heart of the German invaders, Berlin, where the first victorious Soviet red flag was raised over the Reichstag (the film also interspersed a historically significant scene of the Yalta Conference). From these shots, we see the great military achievements of the Soviet people fighting for peace, freedom, and independence, the brilliant military genius of Marshal Stalin, and the Soviet people's selfless spirit of self-sacrifice and patriotism. We also see the demise of German Fascism.
    The film records historical events with great value. The most touching scene is when Stalin, the creator of victory and peace, appeared in front of the Reichstag Square during the liberation of Berlin. It brings people extreme excitement!
    This great Soviet Patriotic War historical record film explains a historical truth to the people of the world: the anti-people's war of aggression will ultimately fail: the First World War produced a great Soviet socialist country, and after the Second World War, many people's democratic countries emerged. The American imperialists, who are attempting to launch a third world war, must remember this!
    The author of the film, Pavlenko, is a famous Soviet novelist and the most outstanding film creator; the director, Chureli, is the most outstanding film director in the Soviet Union. Gelovani, who plays the great people's leader Stalin, is a famous actor well-known to Chinese audiences. He played Stalin in the film "The Vow" and achieved brilliant success. In this film, he once again used his skillful acting skills to show Stalin's unique statesman and military thinker style; Andreev, who plays the protagonist Ivanov, and Kovaleva, who plays Rumyantseva, are both actors with good acting skills. The heroic Soviet Red Army, who personally participated in the attack on Berlin, also participated in the filming of the film.

　　请看德国法西斯的灭亡！
    ——《攻克柏林》介绍之二
    七彩巨片《攻克柏林》，即将在十月革命节上演。这是一件可喜的事。该片是苏联影坛最杰出的影片，曾获得斯大林奖金和一九五○年捷克国际电影评赛会特等奖。
    《攻克柏林》是一部具有高度艺术价值的影片，它通过阿列克塞·伊凡诺夫与娜达莎·鲁明采娃这两个普通苏维埃人的命运，写出了苏联卫国战争史的全部：从德寇背信弃义地发动侵苏战争起，到莫斯科外围战，伟大卫国战争的转折点斯大林格勒之战，顿河战线和斯大林格勒战线的雪地会师，苏联转入强有力的全面进攻，最后直捣德寇的心脏柏林，在帝国会议大厦升起第一面胜利的苏维埃红旗（在影片中还穿插了一幕具有历史意义的雅尔塔会议）。从这些镜头中，我们看到了为和平自由与独立而斗争的苏维埃人民的伟大军事功绩，斯大林大元帅英明的军事天才和苏联人民奋不顾身的自我牺牲精神与爱国主义精神。我们同时也看到了德国法西斯的灭亡。
    影片极可贵地记载了历史事迹。其中最动人的一幕，是当柏林解放之际，在国会大厦前广场出现了胜利及和平的缔造者——斯大林。它带给人们以极度的兴奋！
    这部伟大的苏联卫国战争史记录影片，给世界人民说明了一个历史真理：反人民的侵略战争最终必归于失败：第一次世界大战打出了一个伟大的苏维埃社会主义国家，第二次世界大战后则出现了许多个人民民主国家。妄图发动第三次世界大战的美帝国主义，必须记住这点！
    影片的作者巴甫连柯是苏联的名小说家和最优秀的电影创作家；兼导演的乔列里是苏联最优秀的电影导演者。扮演伟大人民领袖斯大林的盖洛瓦尼是中国观众所熟识的名演员，他在《宣誓》影片中扮演斯大林，曾获得了辉煌的成功。在这影片里，他又以熟练的演技表现了斯大林所特具的政治家和军事思想家的风度；扮演主角伊凡诺夫的安得列耶夫，扮演鲁明采娃的郭瓦略娃都是具有良好演技的演员。亲身参与进攻柏林的英勇苏联红军亦参加了该片的摄演。
