　　Introducing "Paper Tiger" American Imperialism
    ——Reference Material for Propaganda Speakers
    Because American imperialism continues to expand its war of aggression in Korea, our country's borders are under extremely severe threat. In order to strengthen the determination of the broad masses to fight against American imperialism, this document was hastily compiled in a very short time. It can only be considered a very preliminary and simple reference material, focusing on the situation of American imperialism launching a war of aggression. It is intended as an introduction to help the broad masses understand American imperialism. We hope that propaganda speakers will point out any inadequacies so that they can be corrected.

    I. How Big is America?
    America is to the east of China, separated by the Pacific Ocean, more than 15,000 li away. It takes more than half a month to travel by ship from China to America, and even by plane, it takes two or three days.
    The United States has more than 7.8 million square kilometers of territory. Approximately one and a half Americas are equal to one China.
    The United States has a population of over 140 million, which is three times smaller than China's 500 million.
    China has been established for more than 5,000 years, but the United States was only formally established in 1776, which is 174 years ago.
    II. American Imperialism Made Its Fortune Through Bloodshed, Starting with the Murderous Business of Weapons
    The world has fought two world wars. One was the First Imperialist World War from 1914 to 1918, and the other was the Second World War from 1939 to 1945 against German, Italian, and Japanese fascists. During these two world wars, American capitalists made their fortunes through the war trade. They greatly benefited and made a lot of money.
    During the First World War, the countries at war needed a lot of munitions and food. American capitalists did business with both sides, regardless of who was fighting whom. They only joined the war on the side of Britain and France when the war was about to end, thus reaping the benefits of a victorious nation. During this war, American industry developed unprecedentedly. After the war, half of the world's gold was pocketed by American capitalists.
    During the Second World War, although the United States participated in the war, it did not genuinely cooperate with the Soviet Union to fight against the German, Italian, and Japanese fascists. Instead, it took a opportunistic approach. After Hitler's Germany attacked the Soviet Union, the then-President of the United States, Truman, said, "If we see that Germany wins, we will help Russia; if Russia wins, we will have to help Germany. In short, let them kill each other as much as possible." The United States and Britain had originally agreed with the Soviet Union to open a second front in order to attack Germany from both sides, but they deliberately delayed moving their troops for 18 months. Only when they saw the Soviet army routing Hitler's German forces did the American army land in France, effortlessly occupying many places in western Germany. Because of their sinister motives, millions of Soviet Red Army soldiers suffered unnecessary sacrifices. During this war, firstly, the United States used such a trick, suffering little loss of troops; secondly, because the war was not fought on American soil, it was able to steadily increase production. At the time, everyone called the United States the "world's arsenal." This kind of war business was not only very popular and profitable, but also particularly conscienceless. It openly fought against Germany and Japan, while secretly selling military raw materials and weapons to them. In this way, American capitalists earned more than 530 billion US dollars in these five years. Someone calculated that if these dollars were exchanged for gold, they could be cast into a gold mountain weighing more than 40,000 tons.
    Because many countries suffered great sacrifices and losses in the Second World War, among the original major imperialist countries, Germany, Italy, and Japan all collapsed. Britain lost a quarter of its national property, and France was even worse, having been occupied and still unable to recover. Only the United States benefited greatly, so it has now become the leader of the imperialist camp, the largest and most aggressive imperialist country in the world.
    III. In the United States, the Rich are Filthy Rich, and the Poor are Desperately Poor
    The United States made a fortune during the war, but it was not the American people who became rich, but the American capitalists.
    The richest in the United States now are the "Eight Great Families" (including five families, called Morgan, DuPont, Mellon, Rockefeller, and Kennlob; and three local gangs, namely the city of Chicago, the city of Boston, and the city of Cleveland). If all the gold in the world were divided into three parts, these eight families would have two parts. On average, 77 out of every 100 factories in the United States are owned by these eight families. The Morgan family alone accounts for one-sixth of the total banking capital in the United States. On average, 26 out of every 100 miles of railway in the United States are managed by him, and he also controls two-thirds of the steel production in the United States. The DuPont family, only the shirts worn by all Americans are produced by his company. He is also the leading arms dealer. In the first quarter of this year, he earned 42.5 million US dollars from arms manufacturing.
    These big capitalists do not allow others to interfere with the production of their goods. They fight and snatch wealth like dogs biting dogs and big fish eating small fish. They try to concentrate and monopolize all production and capital. During the Second World War alone, 120,000 small factories were squeezed out of business. These families are often colluding with each other, preparing to seize all the good things in the world.
    These monopolistic capitalists engage in production only for their own wealth. Factories and enterprises are privately owned by the capitalists. Making money comes first, so they will do anything to deal with the workers. Their main method of exploitation is to reduce wages. In 1948 alone, American capitalists extracted more than 20 billion US dollars in profits from the sweat and blood of workers. Secondly, because capitalists engage in production not for social needs, if the kind of production they are engaged in does not make much money, they will close the factories, not caring if the workers become unemployed and starve to death.
    Therefore, in the United States, the rich are filthy rich, and the poor are desperately poor. The DuPont family has 500 cars. A big capitalist named Gilminff built a mansion where the faucets, hooks, and door handles are all made of gold. A man named Dugerty spent 250,000 US dollars on a dance party. The cigars smoked by capitalists, some expensive cigars, cost 200 US dollars a box, but some workers' families of eight can only earn 200 US dollars a year.
    A story can show what kind of life American workers live.
    A lumberjack, his wife was very ill, and he had no money to see a doctor. He tried every means to get money, but he couldn't. So he planned to put his finger under the saw and cut it off. This way, he would be disabled and could get 25 dollars in insurance money.
    This worker was lucky, because he still had a job. At the end of last year, there were a total of more than 18 million unemployed and semi-unemployed workers in the United States. In American cities, on average, one in six people have no food to eat.
    After the Second World War, there were no major battles, especially due to the development of the world peace movement, the good business of munitions decreased. The production of daily necessities for the people, because the people are poor, the business is not good, so the capitalists closed many factories, or reduced workers, so more workers were unemployed, and production was greatly reduced. The coal produced in 1949 was more than a quarter less than the previous year. This spring, American capitalists deliberately reduced the planting of wheat by an average of 15 hectares per 100 hectares, and cotton by an average of 25 hectares per 100 hectares.
    This kind of capitalist only cares about making money, blindly producing, resulting in large-scale unemployment of workers, factory closures, and production stagnation. This chaotic situation is called an economic crisis, and it is an incurable disease that capitalism brings from its mother's womb. When this incurable disease is about to come, that is, when workers are forced to have no way out, they will definitely strike and make revolution, and the capitalists will be in danger of being overthrown. For example, at the end of May 1946, 250,000 railway workers in the United States went on strike, and train traffic was stopped. Truman was frightened and thought that this strike was as serious as the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and the outbreak of the Pacific War.
    American monopolistic capitalists, in order to escape the increasingly severe economic crisis, have taken a fancy to war. They disregard the lives of the people of the world and hope that another major war will break out in the world, so that they can do munitions business and make a fortune again. They also want to take a risk in the war, like asking for money, and seize the whole world. They think this plan is well-calculated, so they are constantly clamoring for war, preparing for war, until they openly send troops to invade Korea and Taiwan. This is the root cause of war being the nature of imperialism.
    IV. Who Controls the American Government?
    American monopolistic capitalists have long wanted the American government to listen to everything they say, and for the country's policies to be decided by them. The ways to make money that they come up with are implemented through the government's name. For example, after the United States invaded Korea, the government first had to increase taxes by 4.5 billion US dollars, but the method of taxation stipulated that people with an annual income of 800 to 2,000 US dollars would increase taxes by 20% to 21%, while capitalists with an annual income of more than 500,000 US dollars would only increase taxes by 11%. Most of the tax money collected from the people is used for military expenses. Out of every 100 dollars of the American national budget, 65 dollars are used for military purposes, and only one or two dollars are used for education and health. In this way, the people suffer losses, and the big capitalists make fortunes.
    In order to better achieve their goals, American monopolistic capitalists have two methods. One method is to simply send their own people to the national government to take power. Secretary of State Acheson, who is in charge of foreign affairs and internal affairs, is a lawyer hired by the Morgan, DuPont, and Rockefeller families, and originally ran errands for them. Former Secretary of Defense Johnson, who is in charge of the navy, army, and air force, is the manager of a "United Aircraft Manufacturing Company." Another method is to recommend some very reactionary warlords to important government departments, such as Marshall, the former Chief of Staff of the United States during the Second World War, who served as Secretary of State and is now Secretary of Defense; in particular, some warlords are sent as diplomats, such as the ambassador to Belgium, Admiral Kirk, and the US ambassador to the Soviet Union, Smith, who is also a general; in addition, some retired warlords are found to work in their factories and enterprises, such as Admiral Halsey, who was found by Morgan's International Telecommunications Company and Mellon's Company to be the general manager after retiring. American monopolistic capitalists plan to launch a war, and it is easier to do things with such a group of bad guys in their hands. At the beginning of 1948, there were a total of 50 bankers, financiers, and industrialists and about 30 warlords who were high-ranking officials in the American government.
    Obviously, all the great power in the United States is controlled by a few monopolistic capitalists, who are directly colluding with state government agencies and reactionary warlords, becoming the most ferocious militaristic country. This determines that American imperialism, for the interests of these monopolistic capitalists, must actively carry out foreign aggression, intending to dominate the world.
    V. America's Ambition to Dominate the World
    In order to save itself from the incurable disease of economic crisis, in order to massively sell American goods and continue to make war profits by doing munitions business, American imperialism dreams day and night of ruling the world. It desperately implements a series of reactionary policies of foreign aggression, trying to dominate the world. After the end of the Second World War, the people of the world were full of hope that there would be no more wars and that they could live a peaceful life, but American imperialism had other plans. It clamored everywhere, saying "The 20th century is the American century." Newspapers published large headlines: "America's defense line - the world," regarding the vast Pacific Ocean as its own inland lake, and wanting to treat the people of the world as its slaves. In order to achieve its ambition to dominate the world, American imperialism has adopted the following methods:
    First, in addition to manufacturing large quantities of munitions and conscripting troops domestically, it is seizing places everywhere, whether it is the icy Arctic or the scorching South Seas islands, all of which it wants to occupy as its military bases. After the end of the Second World War, the United States had 484 naval, land and air force bases seized abroad, preparing to have a place to stand once a world war breaks out. On the surface, the US overseas military bases are like spider webs, but they are too far-reaching, the battle lines are too long, and the military strength is not much in the first place, and it is even thinner when dispersed, and it is vulnerable to attack.
    Second, the most vicious trick of American imperialism is to support the German and Japanese fascist bandits again. The United States particularly values the reactionaries in these two countries, believing them to be good henchmen to help the United States dominate the world. Therefore, the American army has been stationed in Japan and western Germany and refuses to leave, fattening them up through various overt and covert means, such as releasing fascist war criminals to work, helping to train troops, and restoring military production. However, the mass movements of the Japanese and German people against the American occupation have already risen, which gives American imperialism a headache. American imperialism regards arming the German and Japanese reactionaries as its capital to launch a world war, so opposing the American support for German and Japanese fascists is an important task for peace-loving people all over the world.
    Third, using the method of enticement, to win over some countries to form military alliances. The "Marshall Plan" and the "North Atlantic Treaty," which we often hear about, are playing this trick. The "Marshall Plan" uses the name of assisting the economic recovery of European countries, and lending a little money to 17 Western European countries. This is called a weasel paying a New Year's visit to a chicken. In fact, the United States lends you money, and your political power, military power, and financial power must be commanded by it. The United States wants to win over these Western European countries to oppose the Soviet Union, the world's peace fortress, and the new democratic countries of Southeastern Europe. But there are many difficulties with this wishful thinking. Take the country of Luxembourg, for example, with a population of only 350,000 people. One Shenyang is larger than four Luxembourgs. The more populous France, the United States intends to have France send troops, and it provides weapons, but who does not know that French soldiers are cowards? During the Second World War, Hitler's Germany invaded France, and it was destroyed in less than half a month. Now the strength of the French Communist Party and the forces defending peace are developing rapidly. If France conscripts troops on a large scale again, some people estimate that there will be many people who signed the peace declaration in the army, and there will be one communist in every four French soldiers.
    Fourth, US President Truman has put forward a vicious plan of aggression, called the "Technical Assistance 'Backward Areas' Plan." This plan sounds very nice, saying that it will use American "technology and knowledge" to "develop the backward areas where more than half of the people in the world live." But the so-called backward areas have long been occupied by other imperialist countries, so in fact, the United States wants to snatch the colonies and dependencies of Britain, France, the Netherlands, Belgium and other countries. This ambition is not small, but this can only cause more quarrels between imperialist countries such as Britain and France and the United States. Affecting some things, they can't twist into a rope.
    Fifth, using the United Nations as an instrument of American aggression. Deliberately making trouble in various UN conferences. The Soviet Union proposed that all countries should reduce their troops and not want to fight, ban atomic bombs, and that major countries should be unanimous in discussing world affairs, but the United States opposed all of this. Taiwan is by nature a sacred territory of our country, but the United States insists on bringing it up to the UN General Assembly to discuss who should govern Taiwan. It is clear that the American army is invading Korea, but it insists on using the name of the UN army as a signboard. The People's Republic of China is a country representing 500 million Chinese people, but the United States does not allow us to participate in the United Nations, and still tightly holds on to the corpse representative of the Kuomintang. But because the Soviet representative speaks fairly at the United Nations conference, exposing the ugly face of American imperialism, the people of the world are recognizing the ferocious appearance of American imperialism day by day, and strengthening their determination to oppose American imperialism.
    In order to dominate the world, American imperialism has also used many methods, such as buying up traitors from some countries to be its lackeys, and sending spies and agents to carry out sabotage activities everywhere, etc. In short, American imperialism is like a mad dog, and wherever there are oppressed people rising up to fight for independence and freedom, it will carry out armed intervention. Wherever people are living a happy life, it is particularly jealous. Yepes, president of an American Danberg University, said that he believes that every American must learn to kill, and should not be limited to killing in the army. He most approves of using germ warfare, releasing poison gas, and dropping atomic bombs, and does not agree with showing a little compassion to hospitals, churches, and schools. "If American imperialism does not die, the disasters will not stop." This is a great truth. Mad dogs want to bite people, and American imperialism must expand its war of aggression. The simple situation is like this.
    VI. Using Atomic Bombs to Scare People with Neurasthenia
    American imperialism is afraid of not being able to defeat the peace-loving people of the world, and it greatly exaggerates how powerful atomic bombs are, wanting to scare people first, to give itself courage, dreaming of using atomic bombs as its magic weapon to dominate the world.
    What kind of bomb is an atomic bomb after all? The atomic bomb does not contain ordinary explosives, but radioactive elements uranium (or praseodymium). When the atomic bomb is dropped, the uranium atoms quickly split and produce very high heat and strong electricity, exploding violently. So, the atomic bomb is a new type of weapon with great destructive power.
    But atomic bombs cannot be used on the battlefield, because the explosive power is strong and will cause losses to one's own troops; they can only be used to bomb peaceful cities, but to drop atomic bombs, the plane must fly very high and master advanced technology, and it is difficult to drop accurately. If the other side has a tight air blockade, the plane carrying the atomic bomb will not be of much use. It is also too expensive to build atomic bombs and cannot be manufactured in large quantities. According to calculations, 100 million catties of pitch ore are needed to refine one catty of uranium.
    At the end of the Second World War, the United States dropped two atomic bombs on Japan, and then publicized that Japan's surrender was due to these two atomic bombs. What are they trying to do? They want to erase the credit of the Soviet army for eliminating the main force of the Japanese army, and erase the credit of the Chinese people for fighting hard with the Japanese devils for eight years. They also want to exaggerate the atomic bomb, so that people all over the world are afraid and dare not fight against American imperialism, and obediently accept its aggression and rule. At the same time, the United States knows that its army is not as good as the Soviet Union's, because the Soviet army has already defeated the German and Japanese armies, which were previously recognized as the strongest in the world. Now, the Soviet Union has many more jet planes that fly very fast for combat than the United States. In terms of the navy, the Soviet submarines are also very good. So the only thing that can be bragged about is the atomic bomb.
    When the Soviet Union announced that it could also manufacture atomic bombs, American imperialism panicked again. Because American industry is very concentrated, it cannot withstand being bombed. Therefore, the United States is also very afraid of atomic bombs, "If you can't eat it, you have to carry it."
    The decision of victory or defeat in war is not solved by one or two new weapons. Modern warfare relies on millions and tens of millions of soldiers fighting, relying on the combined use of various weapons, and relying on the supply and support of all wealth and materials in the entire country. More importantly, it depends on the nature of the war and the attitude of the broad masses of people towards the war. Because shooting guns and dropping bombs will not be done by themselves, but people go to shoot and drop them. Weapons must play a role, it depends on who uses them. In our Chinese War of Liberation, our militiamen with wooden guns were able to capture groups of enemies holding American submachine guns alive. That is the truth. American aggression is unreasonable, without a justified cause, and it uses deceptive recruitment tricks to conscript soldiers, their morale is not high, and the military morale is unreliable, so they can only promote atomic bombs as much as possible, wanting to scare the timid people with neurasthenia.
    It is useless to be afraid of atomic bombs, and it is also useless to be afraid of war. Only by uniting and advocating the ban of atomic bombs, and daring to resist wars of aggression, can we control the murderous imperialists and completely ban atomic bombs. Now, there are more than 500 million people all over the world who have signed the peace declaration, resolutely banning atomic bombs. This is a great force of the people, this is a great force that makes those warmongers who want to use atomic bombs tremble.
    VII. American Imperialism is the Deadly Enemy of the Chinese People
    American imperialism has always been the deadly enemy of the Chinese people. America is so far away from China, and its population is smaller than China's, but its ambition to invade China is not small. The facts of American imperialism's invasion of China are endless.
    Take the "September 18th" Incident as an example. Two years before the "September 18th" Incident, the United States advocated that Chiang Kai-shek should openly sell the Northeast to Japan, and use the money from selling the Northeast to build up the areas within the customs. The intention of the United States was to have Japan concentrate its forces on operating in the Northeast, so that the United States could let go of seizing the areas within the customs, and then instigate Japan to fight the Soviet Union. It could sit on the mountain and watch the tigers fight, and when both sides were hurt, it would take advantage of it. When Japan sent troops to the Northeast, the United States had already signed a secret agreement with Japan, and the United States instructed Chiang Kai-shek not to resist Japan, so it would help Chiang Kai-shek "encircle and suppress" the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army at that time, borrowing money to buy airplanes, and Americans acted as military advisers, offering ideas to fight the civil war.
    After the outbreak of the "July 7th" Anti-Japanese War, the United States used the guise of "neutrality" to sell large quantities of military raw materials, scrap iron, etc. to Japan. The money earned by American capitalists was earned from the lives of our Chinese people dying under the guns, cannons, and bayonets of the Japanese devils!
    The main method of American imperialism's invasion of China is to buy Chiang Kai-shek as its lackey, and Chiang Kai-shek is also the most obedient to his American foreign father's orders. Chiang Kai-shek and the United States signed a lot of traitorous treaties, stipulating that American capitalists could occupy and operate many Chinese factories, mines, customs, railways, aviation, and shipping if they wanted to. For example, the "Shanghai Electric Power Joint Company" established in Shanghai on New Year's Day in 1948, American investment accounted for more than half. In addition to operating electric power, this company also guarantees the investment rights of all public and private roads, rivers, ditches, streets and lanes, and any public property in Shanghai. It also stipulates that the United States can buy Chinese agricultural raw materials at low prices, operate American factories to manufacture things, and then sell them to Chinese people at high prices. Originally, China was an agricultural country, producing a lot of grain and cotton, but during the Kuomintang rule, the rice flour to eat and the cloth to wear were sold to China by the United States instead. This means that Chiang Kai-shek sold everything in our China from the sky to the underground sewers, and the food and clothing of our people to the United States.
    After the Japanese devils surrendered, American imperialism sent a large number of airplanes and warships to transport the Kuomintang bandit army to North China and the Northeast to attack the liberated areas. Then a large number of American troops also invaded the Chinese mainland from ports such as Shanghai and Tianjin. At that time, the Kuomintang reactionary government ordered that they should not be called "American soldiers," but "Allied troops," to show respect. The American troops stationed in China often killed and injured our people at will. At the beginning of 1946, the American troops stationed in Tianjin stipulated the method of compensating for killing Chinese people: killing a donkey would compensate 135,000 yuan, and killing a Chinese person would only compensate 100,000 yuan. A human life is not as valuable as a donkey's life. This is too much bullying of our Chinese people. An American reporter said: "The American army believes that China is a productive country, and human lives are very cheap." American soldiers shot and killed Chinese people, and the Kuomintang traitorous government said: "American guns are too good and easy to fire." American soldiers drove Jeeps wildly and ran over people. In August and September 1946 alone, more than 350 people were killed and injured in Shanghai. The Kuomintang traitorous government said again: "Jeeps are too fast and prone to accidents."
    American imperialism regards China as a big piece of fat. First, China is rich in resources. China has a lot of tungsten, tin, rubber, etc., which the United States lacks as military raw materials. There are also a lot of soybeans, tung oil, bristles, tea... China is very envious and wants to seize them all. Second, China has a large population. If everyone buys American goods, that is a good market for selling American goods. Third, China has a lot of people. It wants to have millions of Chinese people serve as soldiers for American imperialism and wants to use China as an American military camp so that it can invade Asian countries and fight the Soviet Union. These are the reasons why American imperialism helped Chiang Kai-shek with 6 billion US dollars and supplied the Kuomintang with guns and ammunition for more than 8 million bandit troops to kill the Chinese people.
    Now that the Chinese People's Great Revolution has been victorious, its lackey Chiang Kai-shek has collapsed, and foreign slaves are no longer useful. What should we do? Looking at the situation, we have to do it ourselves. Therefore, the United States openly came out to interfere with our liberation of Taiwan and hurriedly invaded and occupied Taiwan. It tried its best to prevent our new Chinese representatives from participating in the UN General Assembly. It also sent bandits and agents to fight secret battles, carrying out sabotage and spreading rumors. American planes have also invaded our airspace several times, strafing and bombing peaceful people, and shelling and searching our merchant ships, carrying out blatant provocations. In particular, it is actively building the so-called "Pacific Defense Line," which is to take Korea, Japan, Taiwan, the Philippines, and Vietnam, so as to tightly surround our People's Republic of China. And Korea is close to our Northeast and the Soviet Union, so it started with Korea first. Therefore, the United States initially invaded Korea, directly threatening the security of our motherland.
    VIII. American Expansion of the War of Aggression in Korea Will Only Lead to Death
    Although the American army killed, wounded, and captured more than 60,000 people in July and August by the Korean People's Army, the gambling ghosts are the most willing to take risks. The American imperialism, the big gambler, is unwilling to admit defeat. In mid-September, it sent more than 40,000 more people. Now the American troops invading Korea have eight divisions and more than 100,000 people, and may increase a little more. But the United States began to invade Korea, it was trapped in the mud, and it would only sink deeper and deeper, leading to death.
    Because the just Korean people are not easy to bully. American soldiers not only tasted the bitterness of being attacked by the Korean People's Army, but now every Korean person is fighting the American soldiers. Although the American army occupied Seoul, it dared not sleep in the city, and it was not safe to spend the night outside the city. They don't know when they will be shot and return to their hometown. Often in the morning, American sentries are found stabbed to death, with knives piercing their shoulder blades. At present, although the Korean people have reached a more difficult and long-term stage of fighting, if you put hundreds of thousands of American soldiers in Korea, then you can forget about winning and going home. There are ultimately three paths in front of the American soldiers: becoming prisoners, being killed, and being driven into the sea.
    American imperialism has invaded Taiwan and continues to expand its war of aggression in Korea, forcing itself on the heads of the Chinese people. It thinks that our Chinese people are weak and can be bullied. This calculation is wrong. The Chinese people love peace, but if you come to drink our blood, we will bravely rise up to resist the war of aggression. The Chinese People's Liberation Army has already annihilated 8.07 million Kuomintang bandit troops armed by the American government. Even if the United States sends over 1.5 million troops, our 500 million Chinese people will unite as one, prepare well, and one punch from each person will be able to beat you to smithereens.
    IX. American Imperialism is Just a Paper Tiger
    In simple summary, the reason why American imperialism is just a paper tiger is that it wants to dominate the world, its ambition is very big, its momentum is fierce, but it has no popular support, it is strong on the outside but weak on the inside, and its interior is weak. For example, it is suffering from the incurable disease of economic crisis; domestic class contradictions are very sharp, that is, the rich are filthy rich, and the poor are desperately poor; the methods it adopts to dominate the world are full of difficulties; other imperialists are not of one mind with it, and they are even more fighting each other when it comes to fighting over bones; and fighting is unjust, and the invasion of Korea shows that its battle lines are too long, its bases are too far away, its morale is not high, and its own people do not support it. So, although it can be fierce for a while, it will eventually collapse.
    The truth of American imperialism's paper tiger, in front of the peace and democratic camp led by the Soviet Union, in front of the vast protection of world peace, is even more obvious.
    Even in the United States, there are already 150 large progressive organizations. When Truman went to Chicago once, the workers posted large slogans of "Strive for Peace" and "Ban Atomic Bombs" in major factories. On American Mother's Day, a total of 2,300 mothers from 42 of the 48 states of the United States wrote letters to Truman, saying that they would not let their children be cannon fodder for the aggressive ruling class. The New American Church, representing 75,000 peace-loving people, and 17 major Christian organizations, also held conferences separately, demanding peace and opposing atomic bombs. Recently, workers at the largest Ford Motor factory in the United States launched a movement against American aggression against Korea. In early August, tens of thousands of American workers, in order to oppose the war of aggression, rushed from the factory to the vicinity of Union Square in New York and began to parade, shouting the slogan: "We want peace." Now there are 100,000 communists in the United States, who are leading the American peace and democratic movement forward.
    The American war monger Acheson went to Britain and France in early May this year to discuss aggression, and was protested by a group of mothers when he arrived in London. They held up signs that read: "Americans come to Britain, it is equal to bombs falling in Britain" "Atomic bombs are war, ban atomic bombs." Acheson went to France again, and the French people wrote everywhere on the walls he passed by: "Down with American warmongers!" "Mr. Acheson, go back! We don't want to see you!"
    Now, the population of the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries alone is more than 800 million. 800 million, this is almost half of the world's population, and the countless peace-loving people in other countries are not counted. The World Federation of Trade Unions has more than 72 million members, the International Democratic Women's Federation has more than 80 million members, the World Federation of Democratic Youth has more than 60 million members, and there are more than 500 million signatories to the movement to defend peace. There are also more than 27 million communists worldwide (according to the total population of the world, there is one communist in every eighty people). France, an imperialist country, has 2 million communists.
    Since American imperialism invaded Taiwan and Korea, the people of the world who love peace, democracy, and freedom also hate American imperialism to death. The past feelings of hatred for German, Italian, and Japanese fascists have been transformed into hatred for everything about American imperialism.
    In the face of such a powerful force of the people, if the American imperialism paper tiger dares to be rampant and arrogant again, then it is indeed a dead end.

　　介绍“纸老虎”美帝国主义
    ——宣传鼓动员讲话参考材料
    因为美帝国主义在朝鲜继续扩大侵略战争，我们祖国的边疆受到极严重的威胁。为着增强广大群众反对美帝国主义的斗争决心，在很匆促的时间内，草草编出这个东西，这只能算是一个极初步极简单的参考资料，也只着重说明美帝国主义发动侵略战争这一方面的情况，作为广大群众了解美帝国主义的一个介绍。其中有不充分的地方，希望宣传鼓动员们指出，以便补正。
    《宣传鼓动员手册》编委会
    一九五○年十月二十日
    一、美国有多么大
    美国在中国的东面，隔着一个太平洋，相隔一万五千多里地。坐轮船从中国开到美国，要走半个多月，就是坐飞机，也得飞两三天。
    美国的国土有七百八十万多平方公里，大约一个半美国才等于我们一个中国大。
    美国人口有一万万四千多万人，和中国五万万人比起来，中国人就比美国人大了三倍多。
    我们中国已经立国五千多年了，但是美国到了一七七六年，也就是一百七十四年前，才正式立国。
    二、美帝国主义是血手成家，从做杀人买卖——战争武器起家的
    全世界打过两次大战。一次是一九一四年到一九一八年的第一次帝国主义世界大战，一次是一九三九年到一九四五年，反对德国、意大利、日本法西斯的第二次世界大战。在这两次世界大战中，美国大资本家做战争买卖发了家，他们在世界大战中，沾了很大的光，发了很大的财。
    第一次世界大战的时候，打仗的国家，需要很多军火和粮食，美国资本家不管它谁打谁，跟两方面都做买卖，一直等到战争快结束时，才站到英国法国那边参了战，又捞了一个战胜国的便宜。在这次大战中，美国工业空前发展。战争结束，全世界的金子，有一半给美国资本家装到他们腰包里去了。
    第二次世界大战中，美国虽然参战，但并不是和苏联真心合作一起打德、意、日法西斯，而是投机取巧。德国希特勒进攻苏联以后，现在的美国总统杜鲁门当时就说过：“要是看出德国打胜，我们就帮助俄国；要是俄国打胜，我们就得帮助德国。总之，让他们尽量撕杀吧。”美国和英国本来和苏联约定开辟第二战场，以便两面夹攻打垮德国，但是他们故意拖延了十八个月不动兵，一直眼看苏联军队又经把德国希特勒军队打得落花流水的时候，美国军队才在法国登陆作战，不费气力地占了德国西部的好多地方。由于他们这样居心不良，使得苏联红军有几百万人遭受不必要的牺牲。在这次大战中，一来因为美国要了这样一手花招，兵力没啥损失；二来因为不是在美国本土打仗，所以能够稳稳当当地开足马力大事生产，当时大家都管美国叫世界兵工厂。美国这种战争生意，不但销路很好，一本万利，还特别丧尽良心，它明面和德国、日本打仗，暗地里还把军事原料和枪炮卖给他们，这样，美国大资本家在这五年当中，就赚了五百三十多万万美元，有人计算了一下，把这些美元换成金子，可以铸成一座四万多吨的金山。
    因为在第二次世界大战中，许多国家牺牲损失很大，原先几个大的帝国主义国家里面，德国、意大利、日本都垮台了，英国损失了它全部国家财产四分之一，法国更惨，亡过国，到现在还不能恢复元气，只有美国占了很大的便宜，所以它现在成了帝国主义阵营的头子，变成全世界最大的、也是最有侵略野心的帝国主义国家了。
    三、在美国国内是富的富得发昏，穷的穷得要命
    美国在战争中发了大横财，但是发财的不是美国老百姓，而是美国大资本家。
    现在美国最有钱的是“八大家”（其中有五个大家族，叫摩根，杜邦，梅隆，洛克菲勒，肯洛白；三个地方帮派，就是芝加哥城，波士顿城，克里夫兰城）。把全世界所有的金子分成三份，这八大家就有两份。美国平均一百个工厂就有七十七个工厂是这八大家开的。摩根这一家，就占有全美国银行资本六分之一，美国所有的铁路平均一百里就有二十六里归他管，他还支配全美国三分之二的钢铁生产。杜邦这一家，单单是所有美国人穿的衬衣，全都是他一家公司出产的，他还是头一位军火大王，在今年第一季，他承造军火挣的钱，就有四千二百五十万美元。
    他们这些大资本家生产的东西，不准别人插手生产。他们像狗咬狗、大鱼吃小鱼一样，明争暗抢发起财来的。尽量的把一切生产和资本都集中垄断起来。就在第二次世界大战中，有十二万家小工厂被挤垮关了板。他们这几大家又常是勾搭连环的，准备把全世界的好东西都霸占到手。
    这些独占大资本家搞生产，只是为的自己发财，工厂企业又都是他们资本家私有的，挣钱第一，所以只要用来对付工人的一切坏招绝招都干得出来。他们主要剥削办法就是减低工资，一九四八年一年，美国资本家刮工人血汗得去的利润，就有二百多万万美元；其次，因为资本家搞生产不是为着社会需要，要是他经营的那种生产挣钱不多，就把工厂关门不干，工人失业饿死他都不管。
    因此在美国，真是富的富得发昏，穷的穷得要命。杜邦一个家庭就有五百辆小汽车。一个名叫季尔敏夫的大资本家，盖了一所洋楼，那里面的自来水龙头、挂钩、门柄都是金子做的。一个叫杜盖尔蒂的，开一次跳舞会就花了二十五万美元。资本家抽的烟卷，有一种贵重的雪茄，一盒二百块美元，但是有的八口人的一家工人，一年才能挣二百块美元。
    有一个故事可以看到美国工人过的什么日子。
    一个锯木头的工人，他的老婆病得很重，没有钱请医生，他用尽各种办法都弄不到钱，他就打算把手指头伸到锯子下边切断，这下残废了，就能得到二十五块保险金。
    像这个工人还算有运气，因为他还有工做。去年年底，美国失业和半失业的工人一共有一千八百多万人。在美国城市里，平均六口人就有一口没饭吃。
    在第二次世界大战以后，没有大仗打，特别由于世界和平运动发展，军火的好买卖减少了，生产老百姓日用品，因为老百姓穷，生意不好的所以资本家又把很多工厂关了，或是减少工人，这样工人失业更多了，生产也大大减少了。一九四九年生产的煤，就比头一年减少四分之一还多。今年春天，美国资本家又故意把小麦平均一百垧少种了十五垧，棉花平均一百垧也少种二十五垧。
    这种资本家只顾自己发财，盲目生产，结果弄得工人大批失业，工厂关板，生产停顿，这种混乱情况，叫做经济危机，是资本主义从娘肚子里带来的绝症。这种绝症快到临头的时候，也就是工人被逼得没活路可走，那一定起来罢工，干革命，资本家就有被推翻的危险。比如一九四六年五月底，美国有二十五万铁路工人罢工，火车来往都停顿，把杜鲁门吓昏了，认为这样罢工和日本袭击美国珍珠港，打起太平洋战争一样的厉害。
    美国独占大资本家，为着逃脱越来越厉害的经济危机，他看中了一门战争，他们不顾全世界老百姓的死活，希望世界再打起大仗来，他们又可以做军火生意发大财。又可以像要钱一样，想在战争中冒一下险，把全世界都霸占到手。他们认为这个算盘打的满好，所以一刻不停地大叫大嚷要战争，准备战争，一直到公开出兵侵略朝鲜和台湾。这也就是战争是帝国主义本性的根由。
    四、什么人操纵美国政府
    美国独占大资本家，早就要美国政府啥事都听他们喝，国家的政策都由他们决定，他们想出的发财办法，通过政府的名义去办。比如美国侵略朝鲜以后，政府第一次就要增税四十五万万美元，但是纳税的办法却规定，一年收入八百到二千美元的人，增百分之二十到二十一的税，而一年收入五十万美元以上的资本家，只增百分之十一的税。这些极大部分向老百姓要来的税款，很多都用做军费，美国国家经费一百块钱就有六十五块钱用在军事方面，一百块钱只有一两块用在教育卫生方面。这样，弄来弄去，吃亏是老百姓，发财是大资本家。
    美国独占大资本家为着更能达到他们的打算，一个办法，就是干脆派他们自己人到国家政府去掌权。管外交和内政的国务卿艾奇逊，就是摩根、杜邦、洛克菲勒三大家雇用过的律师，原先就是给他们跑腿的。管海、陆、空军的国防部前任部长詹逊，是一家“联合飞机制造公司”的经理。再一个办法，就是推荐一些很反动的军阀到政府重要部门去，像第二次世界大战时美国参谋总长马歇尔，当过了国务卿，现在又当了国防部长；特别是派了一些军阀当外交官，像驻比利时大使是一个海军上将寇克，美国驻苏联大使史密特也是一个将军；另外，还找一些退伍军阀到他们的工厂企业办事，像海军上将海尔赛退伍以后，就被找到摩根开的一家国际电讯公司，和梅隆开的一个公司当总经理。美国独占大资本家是打算要发动战争，手里有这样一批坏家伙才好办事。一九四八年初，在美国政府里当大官的，共有银行家、财政家、工业家五十人，军阀大约三十多人。
    很明显的，美国一切大权，都操纵在几个独占大资本家手里，他们又直接和国家政府机关、反动军阀勾连一起，成为最凶恶的军国主义的国家，这就决定了美帝国主义，为了这些独占大资本家的利益，一定要积极向外侵略，打算独霸全世界。
    五、美国独霸全世界的野心
    美帝国主义为了救一下经济危机这个绝症，为着能大量推销美国货，和继续大做军火生意发战争财，它整天成宿地做着统治全世界的梦，拚命的实行向外侵略的一连串反动政策，想独霸全世界。第二次世界大战结束以后，全世界人民都满心希望再不要打仗了，能够过过安生的和平生活，但是美帝国主义却另外有它的打算，到处大叫大嚷，说什么“二十世纪是美国的世纪呀”。报纸上登着大字标题：“美国的防御线——全世界”，把那么大的太平洋当做它美国自己的内湖，想把全世界的老百姓都当它的奴隶。美帝国主义为着达到独霸全世界的野心，采用下面这样几个办法：
    第一，除了在国内大量制造军火，大批征兵外，就是到处霸占地方，不管是冰天雪地的北极，或是能热死人的南洋海岛，都想占去当它的兵站。第二次世界大战结束以后，美国在国外抓到手的海陆空军基地有四百八十四处，准备一旦打起世界大战就有站脚的地方。表面上看来，美国海外军事基地像蜘蛛网一样，可是鞭长莫及，战线太长，兵力本来不多，又加上分散就更单薄，不堪一击。
    第二，美帝国主义一手最毒辣的手腕，就是把德国和日本法西斯匪徒再扶助起来。美国特别看中这两个国家的反动派，认为是帮助美国独霸全世界的好打手，所以美国军队一直驻在日本和德国西部不走，用各种明的暗的办法喂胖他们，像释放法西斯战犯出来做事，帮助训练军队，恢复军事生产。但是日本人民和德国人民反对美国占领的群众运动已经起来，这使得美帝国主义很头痛。美帝国主义是把武装日本和德国反动派，当做它发动世界大战的老本，所以反对美国扶助德国和日本法西斯，是全世界爱好和平人民的重要任务。
    第三，用利诱的办法，拉拢一些国家组织军事同盟。我们常听说的《马歇尔计划》《北大西洋公约》，就是耍的这个把戏。《马歇尔计划》是用援助欧洲各国经济复兴为名义，借一点钱给西欧十七个国家，这叫做黄鼠狼给小鸡拜年，实际上是美国借给你钱，你的政权、军权、财权就得听它指挥。美国想拉拢西欧这些国家来反对世界和平堡垒苏联和东南欧新民主主义国家。但是它这个如意算盘是有很多困难的。拿卢森堡那个国家来说，全国才有三十五万人，一个沈阳就比四个卢森堡还大。人口多一点的法国，美国打算要法国出兵，它出武器，可是谁不知道法国兵才孬呢，第二次世界大战时，德国希特勒进攻法国，不到半个月就亡国。现在法国共产党的力量和保卫和平的力量发展很快，法国再大批征兵，有人估计了一下，那军队里面将会有很多在和平宣言上签名的人，四个法国兵里面也会有一个共产党员。
    第四，美国总统杜鲁门，提出过一个凶恶的侵略计划，叫做“技术援助‘落后地区’计划”。这个计划讲得很好听，什么要用美国的“技术和知识”，来“开发世界上半数以上人民生活的落后地区”。但是所谓落后地区，早就给其他帝国主义国家占去了，所以实际上，美国是想抢走英国、法国、荷兰、比利时等国的殖民地和附属国。这个野心可不小，可是，这只能使得英、法等帝国主义国家和美国的争吵更多了。影响到有些事情，他们就拧不到一条绳子上去。
    第五，把联合国当做美国的侵略工具。故意在联合国各种会议上捣蛋。苏联提出各国应该减少军队不要想打仗，禁用原子弹，讨论世界大事要大国一致才行，美国都反对不干。台湾天经地义是我国神圣领土，美国硬要提到联合国大会去讨论台湾应该归谁管。明明是美国军队侵略朝鲜，它硬用联合国军队名义当招牌。中华人民共和国是代表五万万中国人民的国家，美国却不让咱们参加联合国，还把国民党的僵尸代表抱的紧紧不放。但是因为有苏联代表在联合国会议上讲公道话，揭美帝国主义的盖，使得全世界人民一天天的认清了美帝国主义凶相，增强了反对美帝国主义的决心。
    美帝国主义为着霸占全世界，还用过很多办法，像收买有些国家的卖国贼当它的狗腿子，派间谍特务到处进行破坏活动等等。总之，美帝国主义像疯狗一样，那个地方有被压迫的人民起来为独立自由而斗争，它就要去武装干涉，那个地方的人民在过着幸福快乐的生活，它就特别眼红。美国一个但堡大学校长耶普斯这样说，他认为每一个美国人都必须学会杀人，不应该限在军队才能杀人，他最赞成用细菌战，放毒气，扔原子弹，不同意对医院、教堂、学校发一点点慈悲心。“美帝不死，祸乱不止”，这是一句大实话。疯狗是要咬人的，美帝国主义一定要扩大侵略战争的。简单的情况就是这样。
    六、拿原子弹吓唬神经衰弱的人
    美帝国主义害怕打不过全世界爱好和平的人民，特别大吹大擂原子弹怎么怎么厉害，想把人们先吓唬一下，给自己仗仗胆量，梦想用原子弹，当做它独霸全世界的法宝。
    原子弹到底是啥样炸弹？原子弹里面装的不是普通炸药，而是放射性的原素铀（或镨）。原子弹扔下的时候，铀的原子很快地分裂出很高的热度和很强的电力，猛烈地爆炸起来。所以说，原子弹是一种杀伤力很大的新式武器。
    但是原子弹不能在战场上使用，因为爆炸力强，会使自己的军队受到损失；只能轰炸和平城市，但是要丢下原子弹，飞机要飞得很高和掌握高等技术，而且很难丢准，要是对方有严密的空中封锁，载着原子弹的飞机就没有多大作为。造原子弹又太贵，不能大量制造，根据计算，要用一万万斤沥清矿，才能炼出一斤铀。
    第二次世界大战末尾的时候，美国在日本投过两颗原子弹，于是大肆宣传，说日本投降是吃了这两颗原子弹的缘故。他们用意何在呢？他们是想抹杀苏联军队消灭日本陆军主力的功劳，抹杀中国人民跟日本鬼子苦战八年的功劳。也是想把原子弹吹得天花乱坠，好叫全世界人民害怕，不敢和美帝国主义作斗争，规规矩矩受它侵略统治。同时，美国知道自己的陆军不如苏联，因为苏联陆军已经把先前全世界公认的最强的德国和日本的陆军打垮了。现在作战用的、飞得很快的喷气式飞机，苏联比美国又多得多。海军方面，苏联的潜水艇又提刮刮叫。所以能吹起牛皮的，只有原子弹。
    当苏联宣布也能制造原子弹的时候，美帝国主义又慌神了。因为美国工业很集中，一挨炸是吃不消的。因此，美国又很怕原子弹，“自己吃不了要兜起来”。
    决定战争胜败的，不是一两件新式武器能解决问题的。近代的战争，是依靠几百万几千万当兵的在打仗，依靠各种武器一起配合使用，依靠整个国家所有财粮物资的供给接济。更重要的是决定于战争的性质，决定于广大人民对于战争的态度。因为放枪丢炸弹，不会自己放自己丢，而是人去放去丢，武器要发生作用，是要看什么人去使用的。在我们中国解放战争中，咱们拿木头扎枪的民兵，就能把拿着美国冲锋机枪的敌人成群的活抓过来。就是这个道理。美国侵略人家是没理的，师出无名，又是用欺骗雇用的花招征的兵，士气不高，军心靠不住，所以只有尽量宣传原子弹，想把神经衰弱的胆小鬼吓唬住。
    光光害怕原子弹是不顶事的，单单害怕战争也是不行的，只有团结起来主张禁用原子弹，和敢于反抗侵略战争，才能治住杀人成性的帝国主义者，才能彻底禁用原子弹。现在全世界在和平宣言上签名，坚决禁用原子弹的，已经有五万万多人了，这是一股伟大的人民力量，这是一股叫那些想使用原子弹的战贩们胆颤心惊的伟大力量。
    七、美帝国主义是中国人民的死对头
    美帝国主义一直是中国人民的死对头。美国离中国那么远，人口比中国少，可是侵略中国的野心可不小。美帝国主义侵略中国的事实，是说也说不尽的。
    就拿“九一八”事变来说。在“九一八”事变前两年，美国就主张叫蒋介石把东北公开卖给日本，把卖东北的钱建设关内。美国的用意是叫日本集中力量经营东北，让它美国放手霸占关内，再鼓动日本打苏联，他可以坐山观虎斗，等到两败俱伤，它就占便宜。等到日本出兵东北，美国已经和日本订了密约，美国就指使蒋介石不准对日本抵抗，那么，它就帮助蒋介石“围剿”当时的中国工农红军，借钱买飞机，美国人当军事顾问，出主意打内战。
    “七七”抗日战争爆发以后，美国用“中立”的幌子，大量卖给日本各种军事原料，废铁等等。美国资本家挣的钱，是挣的咱们中国人死在日本鬼子的枪炮刺刀底下的人命啊！
    美帝国主义侵略中国，主要的办法是收买蒋介石做它的狗奴才，蒋介石也是最听他美国洋爸爸的命令。蒋介石和美国订了不老少卖国条约，规定把中国许多工厂、矿山、海关、铁路、航空、海运，美国大资本家想经营就可以占去经营。比如一九四八年元旦在上海成立的“上海电力联合公司”，美国投资占一半还多，这个公司除经营电力外，还包管上海一切公私道路，河流，沟渠，街巷和任何公产的投资权利。又规定美国可以用贱价收买中国的农业原料，经营美国工厂制造出东西，再用高价卖给中国老百姓。原来中国是个农业国，粮食和棉花出产很多，但是在国民党统治时期，吃的米面和穿的布匹，反而是美国卖给中国。这就是说，蒋介石把咱们中国从天上到地下的阴沟，和咱们老百姓吃的穿的都卖给美国了。
    日本鬼子投降以后，美帝国主义派了大批的飞机、军舰，把国民党匪军运到华北和东北，进攻解放区。接着美国军队也大批地从上海、天津等港口侵入中国内地，当时国民党反动政府曾下令不准叫“美国兵”，要叫“盟军”，表示尊敬。驻扎在中国的美国军队，常常随便杀伤咱们老百姓。一九四六年初，驻在天津的美国军队规定杀死中国人的赔钱办法：杀害一个驴子，赔十三万五千元，杀害一个中国人才赔十万元。一条人命不如一头驴子命值钱，这是把咱们中国人欺负太惨了。一个美国记者说：“美国军队认为中国是个多产的国家，人命是非常便宜的。”美国兵用枪打死中国人，国民党卖国政府就说：“美国枪太好，容易走火。”美国兵乱开吉普车轧死人，一九四六年八、九两个月，上海人民被轧死轧伤就有三百五十多人，国民党卖国政府又说啦：“吉普车速度太快，本来容易惹祸。”
    美帝国主义把中国当做它的一块大肥肉。第一，中国物产很丰富，美国军事原料很缺的钨、锡、橡胶等等，中国有的是，大豆、桐油、猪鬃、茶叶……中国又很多，所以美国眼红得很，想都霸占到手。第二，中国人口多，每个人都买它美国货，那就是推销美国货的大好市场。第三，中国有的是人，想叫几百万中国人替美帝国主义当兵，想把中国当做美国大兵营，以便它侵略亚洲各个国家和打苏联。这些就是美帝国主义帮助蒋介石六十万万美元，供给国民党八百多万匪军的枪炮子弹来杀害中国人民的原因。
    现在中国人民大革命胜利了，它的狗腿子蒋介石垮了台，洋奴才再不顶事了，那怎么办呢？看情况非自己动手不成。所以美国就公开地出来干涉我们解放台湾，急急忙忙侵占台湾。在联合国大会竭力阻挡我们新中国代表参加。还派遣土匪特务来打暗仗，进行捣乱造谣破坏。美国飞机也已经几次的侵入我国领空，扫射轰炸和平老百姓，并且炮击和盘查我们的商船，进行公然的挑衅。特别是积极建立所谓“太平洋防线”，就是把朝鲜、日本、台湾、菲律宾、越南都拿到手，这样紧紧地包围我们中华人民共和国。而朝鲜又是紧紧靠近咱们东北和苏联，所以它就先下手搞朝鲜。所以说，美国一开始侵略朝鲜，就直接威胁我们祖国的安全。
    八、美国扩大侵略朝鲜战争，只有死路一条
    美国军队虽然在七、八两月，被朝鲜人民军打死打伤活抓的有六万多人，但是耍钱鬼最会冒险的，美帝国主义这个大赌棍不甘认输，九月中旬，又派了四万多人，现在侵略朝鲜的美国兵力有八个师十几万人，还可能再增加一点，但是美国一开始侵略朝鲜，就是陷进了泥坑，只会越陷越深，死路一条。
    因为正义的朝鲜人民是不好欺负的。美国兵不但吃到朝鲜人民军打击的苦头，现在是每一个朝鲜人民都在打美国兵。美国军队虽然占领了汉城，但是不敢在城里睡觉，出城过夜也不保险，不知道什么时候，就会挨一枪回老家。一到早上，常常发现美国哨兵被人戳死，刀子把他们肩胛骨刺穿了。眼前朝鲜人民虽然到了更艰苦更得持久打下去的阶段，但是你十几万美国兵一上朝鲜，那就休想得胜回家，摆在美国兵面前归终是三条路：当俘虏，被打死，赶到海里去。
    美帝国主义已经侵略了台湾，并继续扩大在朝鲜的侵略战争，逼到咱们中国人民头上来了，它认为咱们中国人民软弱可欺，这个打算是错了，中国人民热爱和平，但是你要来喝咱们的血，咱们是会英勇的起来反抗侵略战争。中国人民解放军已经消灭了由美国政府武装起来的八百零七万国民党匪军，就是美国一百五十多万军队打过来，咱们中国五万万人，都团结一致，准备得好好的，一人一拳头就能捶得你稀巴烂。
    九、美帝国主义是只纸老虎
    简单归结起来说，美帝国主义所以是只纸老虎，就是他想霸占全世界，野心很大，气势汹汹，但是它是没有人民支持的，外强中干，内部虚弱。比方，它本身就害着经济危机这个绝症；国内阶级对立很尖锐，就是富的富得发昏，穷的穷得要命；它在霸占全世界所采取的办法便是困难重重；别的帝国主义又不是和它那么一条心，争起骨头来，更是勾心斗角；打起仗来又是非正义的，侵略朝鲜就看出它战线太长，基地太远，士气不高，本国人民不拥护。所以虽然能逞凶一时，终归是要垮台的。
    美帝国主义纸老虎的真相，在苏联为首的和平民主阵营面前，在广大的保卫世界和平面前，那就显得更明显了。
    就在美国，已经有一百五十个大的进步组织。杜鲁门有一次到芝加哥城，工人们就把各大工厂贴满了“争取和平”“查禁原子弹”的大幅标语。美国母亲节那天，美国一共四十八州，就有四十二个州的二千三百位母亲给杜鲁门写信，信里说，不让她们的儿女给侵略的统治阶级当炮灰。代表七万五千名爱好和平人士的新美教，和十七个重要基督教组织，也分别开了大会，要求和平，反对原子弹。最近，美国最大福特汽车工厂的工人开展了反对美国侵犯朝鲜的运动。八月上旬，有成千成万的美国工人，为了反对侵略战争，从工厂冲到纽约联合广场的周围，开始游行，高喊着：“我们要和平”的口号。现在美国有着十万共产党员，正领导着美国的和平民主运动向前发展。
    美国战争贩子艾奇逊，今年五月初到英国、法国去商量侵略的事情，到伦敦的时候，就遭受了一群母亲们的抗议。她们举着标语牌，上面写着：“美国佬来英国，就等于炸弹落在英国”“原子弹就是战争，禁止原子弹。”艾奇逊又到了法国，法国人民在他一路通过的墙上，到处写了：“打倒美国战争贩子！”“艾奇逊先生，回去！我们不要看见你！”
    现在，光是苏联和各人民民主国家的人口加起来，就有八万万以上。八万万，这就快要占到全世界人口的一半，其他国家的无数的爱好和平的人民还没算进去。参加世界工联的有七千二百多万会员，国际民主妇联有八千多万会员，世界民主青联有六千多万会员，还有五万万以上保卫和平运动的签名者。全世界也已经有了两千七百多万共产党员（按全世界总人口计算，八十个人里面就有一个共产党员）。法国这个帝国主义国家就有二百万共产党员。
    自从美帝国主义侵略台湾、朝鲜以后，全世界爱好和平、民主、自由的人民，也都恨死美帝国主义了。把过去仇恨德、意、日法西斯的感情，已经转变为仇恨美帝国主义的一切了。
    在这样强大的人民力量面前，美帝国主义纸老虎要是胆敢再横行猖狂下去，那么它的的确确是死路一条。
