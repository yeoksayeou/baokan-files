Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 24th: The Chongqing industrial and commercial sectors are accusing American economic aggression of destroying our national industry.

According to statistics, within a year after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, 80% of small and medium-sized factories in Chongqing went bankrupt, and two-thirds of the factories affiliated with the Chongqing Industrial Association were shut down. Of the 390 factories that moved to Sichuan from Nanjing, Shanghai, and other places during the Anti-Japanese War, only 20 remained. Li Zhiqin, manager of the Yu Xin Steel Plant, mentioned the situation of steel companies closing down at that time and said indignantly, "American-made steel plates, angle iron, and other materials poured in, while the reactionary and traitorous Nationalist government at that time issued the argument that 'the industry in the Southwest is backward and cannot be supported,' kicking us aside. All orders from various factories were cancelled, causing almost all of the more than 400 steel and machinery industries in Chongqing, except for a few government-run military industries, to collapse. Larger-scale companies such as Yu Xin Steel Plant, China Steel Manufacturing Company, and China Xingye Company all reduced production or closed down one after another." Chen Shujing, manager of the Chongqing Milk Farm, said, "At that time, the Chongqing milk powder market was monopolized by American-made Klim milk powder, making two-thirds of Chongqing's milk production unsellable. Everyone had no choice but to slaughter dairy cows and sell cowhide to survive. My family alone slaughtered more than 40 cows one after another."

Due to American economic aggression, various small-scale industries and handicrafts suffered the most. Out of 467 leather manufacturing businesses in Chongqing, 337 went bankrupt after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War. The chairman of the Toothbrush Industry Association described the situation of the industry at that time: American-made glass toothbrushes poured in like a tide, forcing us to reduce our monthly production from 70,000 dozens to 8,000 dozens. At that time, we requested relief from the relevant departments of the Nationalist government, but the reply we received was: "It's better to close down early to avoid future troubles."

The American dumping policy was meticulous, such as dumping paper, not only a large amount of daolin paper, typing paper, and copy paper, but even toilet paper was shipped in. Several larger paper mills in the Southwest, such as the Jianguo Paper Mill in Chengdu, the Hualun Paper Mill in Chongqing, and the Puquan Paper Mill, all closed down at this time. Wang Puquan, manager of the Puquan Paper Mill, recounted the process of his paper mill being forced to shut down, saying: The cigarette paper of the Puquan Paper Mill was once popular in the Southwest. After the market was occupied by American goods, we transported the goods to the Northwest, but soon American goods followed, and finally we had to shut down.

Other industries such as knitting and cigarettes also accused the disasters of bankruptcy and closure caused by American goods controlling the market.

The Chongqing industrial and commercial sectors mentioned in their accusations against American economic aggression that even during the Anti-Japanese War, the United States began to attack the industry and commerce in the rear. At that time, within the traitorous Nationalist government, a "Wartime Production Bureau" was established with the American Nelson as an advisor. In fact, this so-called production bureau was a criminal institution used by the United States to strangle our national industry and commerce. Many industrialists and businessmen stated: China's industrial and commercial sectors should not forget these painful experiences and lessons, and should take practical actions to resolutely fight against American imperialism. The city's industrial and commercial sectors are now holding anti-American and aid-Korea symposiums by industry, conducting current affairs studies, and signing patriotic covenants.

### 重庆工商界纷纷控诉  美帝摧残我民族工商业

　　重庆工商界纷纷控诉
    美帝摧残我民族工商业
    【新华社重庆二十四日电】重庆市工商业界控诉美国经济侵略对我民族工业的摧残。
    据统计，在抗日战争胜利后一年内，重庆中、小工厂倒闭了百分之八十，重庆工业协会所属工厂停工者达三分之二。抗战时由南京、上海等地迁来四川的三百九十家工厂，仅剩下二十家。渝鑫钢铁厂经理李志亲提到那时钢铁业纷纷关厂停工的情况时激愤地说：“美制钢板、角铁等源源涌来，而那时的国民党反动卖国政府却发出“西南工业落后，不堪扶植”的论调，把我们一脚踢开。各厂的订货都全部解除，使得重庆四百余家钢铁机器业除了几家官办的军火工业外，几乎全部垮台。规模较大的渝鑫钢铁厂、中国制钢公司、中国兴业公司等，都先后减产或关闭。”重庆牛奶场经理陈叔敬说：“当时重庆的奶粉市场为美制克宁奶粉所独占，使重庆牛奶业三分之二的出产卖不出去，大家只有宰杀奶牛卖牛皮度日，只我一家先后就杀了四十多头。”
    由于美国的经济侵略，各种小型工业及手工业受害最深。重庆市制革业四百六十七家，在抗战胜利后就倒闭了三百三十七家。牙刷业同业公会理事长叙述该业当时的情况：美制玻璃牙刷像潮水一样地涌来，迫使我们由月产七万打降至八千打。当时我们曾向国民党政府主管部门请求救济，得到的回答却是：“早关门也好，免得将来麻烦。”
    美国的倾销政策是无微不至的，如倾销纸张，不仅有大量的道林纸、打字纸、拷贝纸，而且连手纸也都运来了。西南几家较大的纸厂，如成都的建国纸厂，重庆的华伦纸厂和溥泉造纸厂等，都是这时倒闭的。溥泉造纸厂经理汪溥泉讲述他的纸厂被迫停工的经过称：溥泉纸厂的卷烟纸曾经畅销西南，在被美货侵占了市场以后，我们又把货物运到西北，但不久美货又跟踪而至，最后只好停工。
    其他如针织、卷烟等业，也纷纷控诉由于美货控制市场而遭到的破产倒闭的灾难。
    重庆市工商业界在对美国经济侵略的控诉中提到：还在抗战时期，美国就开始打击大后方的工商业。那时在卖国的国民党政府内，成立了以美国人纳尔逊为顾问的“战时生产局”，实际上，这个所谓生产局，就是美国绞杀我国民族工商业的罪恶机构。许多工商业家们表示：中国的工商业界不应该忘记这些惨痛的经历和教训，应该以实际行动坚决对美帝国主义进行斗争。全市工商业界现正以行业为单位举行抗美援朝座谈会，进行时事学习，并签订爱国公约。
