Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, 23rd: French army planes invading Vietnam have repeatedly violated our country's airspace, carrying out indiscriminate bombing and strafing, killing and wounding over forty of our compatriots, and causing substantial property losses. On October 19th at 3:20 PM (local time), four French planes intruded into our territory from Vietnam, flying 70-80 kilometers into Guangxi Province's Longzhou Special District, reaching the airspace over Tianbao County town, flying low and circling while bombing our peaceful residents, dropping a total of six bombs, killing and wounding over forty of our people, destroying over a hundred houses, and destroying a stone bridge. Total losses are estimated at around RMB 500 million. (Details of the bombing and a list of the injured can be found on page three of today's newspaper).

Xinhua News Agency, Jingxi, Guangxi, 23rd: People from all walks of life in Tianbao County, Guangxi, held a rally on October 31st to protest the French planes' atrocities and commemorate the compatriots who died. The families of the deceased attended with grief and indignation. At the meeting, the chief mourner, Tianbao County Magistrate Huang Hong, said in his eulogy: "We, the people of Tianbao and all the people of China, will never forget the bloody feud of French planes brutally murdering dozens of our compatriots on October 19th. French imperialism, in its death throes from its failed invasion of Vietnam, is inflicting harm on our compatriots. We resolutely oppose this provocation. We must unite firmly and avenge our dead compatriots." Yi Yingjie, a representative of the bereaved families, said with great anger: "My mother was bombed to death, my older and younger sisters were injured, and all our houses were bombed to the ground. We, the affected families, clearly recognize the brutal behavior of French imperialism, and we must resolutely oppose French imperialism."

The compatriots killed by the French planes have been buried by the Tianbao County People's Government, and those injured are being properly treated in hospitals. The families of the victims have received relief from the People's Government and people from all walks of life in the county. At the meeting, they expressed their heartfelt gratitude for the care and concern of the People's Government.
