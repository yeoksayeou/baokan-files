　　Report on the Situation and Problems of Organizing
　　Editor's Note: The report by the Changzhi Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party on the situation and problems of organizing raises some new issues in the mutual aid and cooperation movement in the old liberated areas. This report also presents the Changzhi Prefectural Committee's views and practices regarding these issues. This is a very important report and is worth referencing and studying in various localities.

            I. New Situation in the Old Liberated Areas' Countryside
    The land reform in the old liberated areas of Changzhi has freed farmers from poverty and backwardness, making it possible to develop production.
    After the land reform, the old liberated areas have undergone five or six years of production campaigns, and some have undergone three years. During the production campaigns, farmers showed great enthusiasm and initiative because they were working for themselves on their own land. Therefore, although many areas had suffered severe destruction from the enemy and puppets, and rural productive forces had suffered great losses, the recovery of the agricultural economy was rapid. Currently, the total agricultural output of the old liberated areas has recovered to pre-war levels. In some areas, output has exceeded pre-war levels, and in good villages and among heroes, model workers, and activists in production, output has exceeded pre-war levels by 50% to 100%. The lives of farmers in the old liberated areas have indeed begun to become prosperous. Many farmers have not only improved their lives but also have grain reserves. According to a survey in Wuli Village, the vast majority of farmers have surplus grain ranging from 5 shi to 30 shi, and in other counties, some farmers have as much as 40 to 70 shi of surplus grain. Some villages' farmers have invested their surplus grain in cooperatives or deposited it in credit unions. Of course, this fact does not mean that we can complacently say that farmers in the old liberated areas are very wealthy. However, this fact does indicate that there is a good foundation for further increasing agricultural productivity and expanding agricultural reproduction.
    In 1950, due to the basic end of the revolutionary war nationwide, the control of major cities and industries by the People's Government, the gradual establishment of new urban-rural relations, the general recovery and development of agricultural production, and the correct implementation of the Party's policies in rural areas, a new class differentiation began in the countryside. According to surveys, a few new rich peasants have emerged. About 4% of farmers have risen to become prosperous middle peasants, and 85.4% of households have risen to become middle peasants. Land prices have also increased significantly. Therefore, the changes in the countryside over the past year have been obvious and significant.
    Due to the rapid recovery and development of agricultural production, the gradual enrichment of farmers' lives, and the beginning of new class differentiation, some new problems and demands have arisen among the farmer masses, rural Party members, and grassroots cadres in rural areas, accompanying this change. What are these new problems and demands? It is that among the farmer masses, especially among farmers whose economic status has risen relatively quickly, there is a willingness to freely develop production, and there is a lack of interest or reduced interest in organizing. This is the basic reason why mutual aid teams in the old liberated areas have shown signs of disintegration, shrinking, and even partial dissolution this year.
    Free development and a willingness to work individually are inherent characteristics of peasant small producers. This ideology can only find a correct path of development when farmers have realized that they must follow the path of cooperatives (starting with supply and marketing, then mutual aid in production, and then collectivization of production) pointed out to them by the proletarian party. Otherwise, the path of a few farmers rising to become new rich peasants while other farmers decline and go bankrupt is unavoidable. Neglecting this point will inevitably lead to a laissez-faire attitude towards the leadership of agricultural production in the minds of rural cadres, which will cause us to make extremely serious mistakes in our rural work.
    Since the ideology of free development and unwillingness to organize is the main reason hindering organization, why can 70% to 80% of farmers in the Changzhi old liberated area be organized? To answer this question, it must be recognized that the vast majority of this so-called 70% to 80% belongs to temporary, small-scale (two or three households), and relatively low-level forms. This form exists more widely because many mutual aid teams that were more regular in the past have gradually become semi-dissolved after improvements in production conditions. Therefore, the trend of a large number of temporary labor exchange (mutual aid) forms developing does not mean that farmers do not have the ideology of free development and individual work; on the contrary, it proves the disintegration of organization. On the other hand, the important reason why it is still possible to organize is that the leading organs have seen or foreseen this trend, and have timely raised farmers' awareness of organization, educating farmers with the concrete facts of developing production through organization over the past few years, so that farmers have experienced that organization is more beneficial than individual work. At the same time, the combination of new science and technology with the mutual aid movement has revitalized many disintegrating mutual aid teams.

        II. Organizing to Improve Agricultural Technology, Raising Agricultural Production in the Old Liberated Areas a Step Further.
    Chairman Mao has clearly indicated the direction of agricultural development, which is to go through cooperatives, i.e., cooperatives "based on collective labor on an individual economic basis" (agricultural production mutual aid organizations are also a form of cooperative). The Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China also instructed us to gradually guide the dispersed individual agricultural economy towards modernization and collectivization through cooperatives. That is to say: The long-term goal of New Democratic agricultural production is modernization and collectivization, but to achieve this goal, it must be a process of "gradual development from individual to collective." In the process of developing towards collectivization, not only is mutual aid in agricultural labor needed, but also various kinds of cooperatives—supply and marketing, production, and credit—are needed to gradually develop agricultural production towards the path of cooperatives. Only through this path can the vast majority of farmers rise to become prosperous farmers. Therefore, in implementing this direction, on the one hand, we must oppose various kinds of utopian agricultural socialist ideologies and the ideology of taking pride in poverty and not engaging in production, and we must also fight against the impatient disease of trying to organize farmers and move towards collectivization in one morning. At the same time, on the other hand, we must also oppose the laissez-faireism of abandoning leadership over agricultural production and allowing it to develop freely. It should be understood that the Party must lead agricultural production, that is, to implement the direction of organizing and gradually moving towards collectivization.
    In order to implement this basic direction, the Shanxi Provincial Party Congress proposed that "combining mutual aid and cooperation with new technologies increasingly closely is a new direction for the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement," which is very necessary. Because with this policy, the mutual aid and cooperation movement in the old liberated areas has entered a new stage of development, which has added strength to carrying out the competition movement of organizing to develop production and "individual work." Undoubtedly, it is also very important for raising agricultural production in the old liberated areas a step further.
    The policy of combining mutual aid and cooperation with new technologies has brought agricultural production in the old liberated areas into a new era. This is manifested in the great interest of the broad masses of farmers in adopting new scientific technologies and the obvious results they have achieved. The adoption of new agricultural tools and the improvement of old agricultural tools in rural areas have already begun, which is a revolution in agricultural production.
    The mutual aid movement that combines mutual aid and cooperation with new technologies has, on the basis of the past, appeared in three forms in the Changzhi area: The first is mutual aid teams with voluntary equivalence, scientific division of labor, emphasis on technology, and common ownership of agricultural tools (some even have forests, land, etc.). The most prominent feature is the gradual adoption of new technologies and the public purchase of major agricultural tools. The second form is: voluntary equivalence, technical division of labor, and integration of agriculture and sideline occupations. The third form is: voluntary equivalence and year-round mutual aid labor exchange teams. These three forms are relatively stable, and some have a history of several years.
    Currently, we are adopting the concrete policy of carrying out typical experiments, cautiously promoting the first type, and developing the second and third types on a large scale to carry out the organization movement.
    Does the mutual aid form of public purchase of agricultural tools promote utopian agricultural socialist ideas? Does it damage the foundation of private ownership? Is it the result of commandism and some people taking advantage of others? This series of questions is indeed related to the fundamental principles of the mutual aid movement. After examining several mutual aid teams that publicly purchase agricultural tools, we believe that the emergence of this form is a new factor generated within the mutual aid team after farmers have organized to develop production and after several years of historical education on organization, but its foundation is still the private economy (i.e., contributing capital for purchase and repair according to the proportion of land owned, and at the same time, when farmers leave the team, they are still given a fair refund of shares according to the newness and oldness of the agricultural tools). Therefore, it is not the result of utopian agricultural socialist ideas and commandism. Although the vast majority of mutual aid teams do not have the conditions to adopt this form, the emergence of this higher form in agricultural production is also of great educational significance for farmers' organization.

    III. Organizing Rural Idle Funds and Surplus Labor into Re-production through Cooperative Forms.
    With the rapid recovery and development of agricultural production in the old liberated areas, how to absorb farmers' surplus capital and labor into re-production has become a problem that must be solved in the agricultural economy.
    After the increase in farmers' wealth, rural idle funds have emerged. If this capital is not given correct guidance to develop in the right direction, it will spontaneously develop in the capitalist direction. Existing experience proves that developing rural credit cooperation and expanding agricultural investment are the fundamental directions for organizing farmers' surplus capital to invest in re-production. The credit department of the Wuli Village Cooperative has absorbed deposits of varying amounts from 60% of the households in the village, which has played a huge role in carrying out rural supply and marketing businesses, fully proving the importance of developing credit cooperation.
    Organizing the integration of agriculture and sideline occupations through cooperative forms to find production outlets for surplus labor is an effective method we have used for several years. However, due to the limitations of various natural conditions, this policy has extreme limitations in organizing surplus labor. In particular, as the rural economy continues to develop and the trend of various productions becoming specialized gradually becomes obvious, the form of integrating agriculture and sideline occupations will hinder the development of handicraft production. Therefore, under the current conditions—when industry develops in the future, a large number of rural surplus labor will flood into factories—organizing various handicraft and sideline production cooperatives is a better way to solve surplus labor.

            IV. On the Rich Peasant Problem:
    In the stage of New Democracy, the existence of urban and rural capitalism is allowed, and it can obtain the necessary development. Under this condition, the emergence of new rich peasants after the development of rural production is inevitable. The emergence of new rich peasants is not terrible, and it has a positive effect on the development of the New Democratic agricultural economy.
    However, another question is: Does allowing the existence of the rich peasant economy mean allowing rich peasants to participate in labor mutual aid and cooperatives? Allowing the capitalist exploitation of hired labor by rich peasants, but is it allowed to carry out this exploitation in semi-socialist mutual aid organizations? If rich peasants are allowed to participate in labor mutual aid and this capitalist exploitation is also allowed, will the production relations of equal exchange within the labor mutual aid team be changed? This series of questions, although not a universal problem in the mutual aid and cooperation movement in the old liberated areas, the fact that individual rich peasants do not adopt the form of hiring workers, but instead adopt the form of paying wages in rice in labor mutual aid, in order to exploit the greater surplus value of farmers organizing labor, does exist.
    Labor mutual aid organizations are semi-collective economic organizations of the working people, and rich peasants are the rural bourgeoisie. If rich peasants are allowed to participate in labor mutual aid organizations and rich peasants are allowed to carry out capitalist exploitation, then changes in the internal production relations of labor mutual aid organizations are inevitable. The result of unequal relations is beneficial to the rich peasants, but it is detrimental to the laboring farmers.
    No appropriate solution has yet been found to this problem, but judging from the development trend, the possibility of rich peasants gradually differentiating themselves from labor mutual aid is extremely high. Because in mutual aid, when farmers feel that this practically unequal relationship is unfavorable to their own development, it is possible and should be promoted to withdraw rich peasants from mutual aid. Another possibility is that when rich peasants feel that participating in mutual aid is not more beneficial than hiring workers for individual work, they may also voluntarily withdraw from the team.
    In addition, we are considering, in mutual aid teams where rich peasants who have grown up in production mutual aid over the past few years have not yet differentiated themselves, to adopt the method of labor accumulation based on the amount of land harvest, in order to reduce the greater surplus value of rich peasants exploiting farmers organizing collective labor, which is beneficial to the laboring farmers' development of their own economy.
    Finally, a question that should be resolved is whether the differentiation of rich peasants from the mutual aid movement, or the adoption of labor accumulation methods to avoid the greater exploitation of laboring farmers by rich peasants, is contradictory to allowing the existence of the rich peasant economy? Does it exclude the rich peasant economy? We believe that allowing the existence of rich peasants and not allowing rich peasants to have unequal exploitative relations in mutual aid with farmers cannot be considered as excluding rich peasants. Because the basic principle of labor mutual aid is equivalence, and damaging this principle is wrong. At the same time, adopting the management form of hiring workers is also beneficial to the development of rich peasants.

　　关于组织起来的情况与问题的报告
    编者按：中共长治地委关于组织起来的情况与问题的报告，提出了老区农村互助合作运动中的一些新的问题。这个报告，并提出了长治地委对于这些问题的看法和做法。这是一个很重要的报告，值得各地参考与研究。
            一、老区农村的新情况
    长治老区农村，经过了土地改革，使农民摆脱了贫困、落后的状态，使发展生产成为可能。
    土地改革后，老区农村经过了五、六年的生产运动，有的也经过了三年的生产运动。在生产运动中，由于农民是在自己的土地上为自己劳动，表现了高度的热情与积极性。因此，许多地区虽然曾经敌伪惨酷破坏，农村生产力遭受了极大损失，但农业经济的恢复却是迅速的。目前老区农业生产，从其总产量说已恢复到战前水平，部分地区超出了战前产量，好的村庄与生产中的英雄、模范、积极分子则已超出了战前产量的百分之五十至一倍以上。老区农民的生活，确已开始富裕起来了。不少农民不只生活已有改善，而且已有存粮，据五里后调查绝大多数农民余粮均在五石以上三十石以下，其他各县部分农民余粮有多至四十至七十石者。部分村庄农民余粮有向合作社投资或信用部存款者。当然这一事实，并不能自满地说：老区农民已是十分富裕了。但这一事实却说明：继续提高农业生产力，扩大农业再生产已有了一个良好的基础。
    在一九五○年，由于革命战争在全国基本结束，大城市与工业被人民政府所掌握，新的城乡关系逐步建立，农业生产普遍恢复与发展，党在农村中的政策能正确实施等条件，农村中新的阶级分化在开始了。据调查，已有个别新富农产生，约有占总户数百分之四的农民上升为富裕中农，有百分之八十五点四的农户上升为中农了。地价也已显著地提高。所以一年来农村变化是明显而巨大的。
    由于农业生产的迅速恢复与发展，农民生活日渐富裕，新的阶级分化的开始，在农民群众中，农村党员、农村的基层干部中，伴随着这一变化，产生了一些新的问题与要求。这些新的问题与要求是什么呢？就是在农民群众中，特别在经济上升比较迅速的农民中，产生了愿意自由地发展生产，产生了不愿意、或者对组织起来兴趣不大了的“单干”思想。这是老区互助组今年呈现涣散、萎缩以至部分陷于解体的基本原因。
    自由发展、愿意单干是农民小生产者原有的特点，这种思想，只有在农民已经觉悟到、要走无产阶级的政党向他们所指出的合作社（开始是供销的生产互助、然后是生产集体化）的道路时，才能找到正确的发展道路。否则，少数农民上升为新富农，而使其他农民没落破产的道路，是不可避免的。忽视了这一点，在农村干部思想中，必然产生对农业生产的领导放任自流的现象，这，将会使我们在农村工作中犯极大的错误。
    自由发展、不愿意组织起来的单干思想，既成为妨害组织起来的主要原因，那么在长治老区为什么又能有百分之七、八十的农民组织起来呢？回答这一问题，必须看到所谓百分之七、八十，其中绝大多数是属于临时的、小规模的（三户两户的）比较低级的形式。这种形式之所以更加广泛地存在，是因为有许多在过去互助比较经常的互助组，在生产条件改善后，逐渐趋于半解体状况的结果。所以临时性拨工（互助）形式的大量发展的趋向，并不能说明农民没有自由发展的单干思想，相反地证明了组织起来的涣散状况。另一方面，还能够组织起来的重要原因，是在于领导机关看到或预见了这一趋势，及时地提高农民对于组织起来的觉悟程度，以几年来组织起来发展生产的具体事实教育农民，使农民体验到组织起来比之单干更为有利。同时使新的科学技术与互助运动相结合的结果，使不少涣散的互助组重新活泼起来了。
        二、组织起来提高农业生产技术，使老区农业生产提高一步。
    农业生产的发展方向，毛主席早已明确指示，就是要经过合作社，即“建立在个体经济基础上的集体劳动”的合作社（农业生产的互助组织亦是合作社的一种形式）。中共中央二中全会亦指示我们经过合作社，逐步地把分散的个体的农业经济引向现代化和集体化的方向。这就是说：新民主主义的农业生产，从其远大的目标来说是近代化集体化的方向，但要达到这一目标，又必须是“由个体逐步的向集体方向的发展”过程。在向集体方向发展过程中，不只需要农业生产上的劳动互助，而且需要组织各种各样的——供销的、生产的、信用的合作社，使农业生产逐步地向合作社的道路发展。经过这一道路，才能使绝大多数农民上升为富裕的农民。因此，在贯彻这一方向时，一方面必须反对各种各样的空想的农业社会主义思想，和以贫为荣不事生产的思想作斗争，也要反对企图在一个早上就把农民组织起来走向集体化的急性病。同时另一方面也必须反对对农业生产放弃领导，任其自由发展的自流主义。应该了解，党对农业生产必须加以领导，就是说，要贯彻组织起来，逐步走向集体化的方向。
    为了贯彻这一基本方向，山西省党代会提出之“把互助合作与新的技术日益密切地结合起来，是互助合作运动的新的发展方向”的提法是十分必要的。因为有了这一方针，使老区的互助合作运动，走向了新的发展时期，它给开展组织起来发展生产与“单干”的竞赛运动增加了力量。无疑的，它对老区农业生产提高一步也是十分重要的。
    互助合作运动与新的技术相结合的方针，使老区农业生产进入一个新的时期，这表现在广大农民对新的科学技术的采用感到极大兴趣而且收到了明显的效果。农村中，新式农具的采用与旧农具的改良，业已开始，这是农业生产上的革命。
    使互助合作与新的技术相结合的互助运动，在过去的基础上，在长治区出现了三种形式：第一种是自愿等价、科学分工、讲究技术、农具（有的尚有森林、土地等）公有的互助组，其最突出的是新的技术逐渐采用，与主要农具的公共购买。第二种形式是：自愿等价、技术分工、农副业结合。第三种是自愿等价、全年互助的拨工组。这三种形式均较巩固，有的已有数年历史。
    目前采取典型试验慎重推广第一种，大量发展第二、三种，这是我们开展组织起来运动的具体方针。
    采取农具公共购买的互助形式，是否助长空想的农业社会主义思想？是否损害了私有制的基础？是否是由于命令主义与一部分人占另一部分人的便宜的结果呢？这一连串的问题，确实是有关互助运动的根本原则问题。我们考查了若干农具公共购买的互助组后，认为这种形式的产生，是农民组织起来发展了生产，又经过几年的组织起来的历史教育之后，互助组内部所产生的新的因素，但它的基础仍然是私有经济（即按土地之多少比例出资购买与修理，同时农民出组时，仍按农具之新旧程度给以公道的退股的权利）。因而他不是空想的农业社会主义思想与命令主义的结果。虽然在绝大多数互助组中并未具备采用这种形式的条件，但在农业生产中出现了这一较高的形式，对农民组织起来的教育意义也是很大的。
    三、经过合作社的形式，组织农村游资与剩余劳力投向再生产。
    随着老区农业生产的迅速恢复与发展，如何吸收农民剩余资本与劳力投向再生产的问题，已成为农业经济中必须解决的问题了。
    农民财富增加后，农村游资产生了，这种资本如果不给以正确的指导，使之向正确方向发展，这种资本将自流地向资本主义方向发展。已有的经验证明：发展农村信用合作与扩大农业投资，是组织农民剩余资本投向再生产的根本方向。五里后合作社的信用部，吸收了全村户数百分之六十的多少不等的存款，对开展农村供销业务起了巨大作用，完全证明了发展信用合作的重要性。
    经过合作社组织农副业结合的形式，给剩余劳力找寻生产出路，是我们几年来行之有效的方法。但由于各种自然条件的限制，这一方针对组织剩余劳力上有其极大的局限性。特别是农村经济继续向前发展，各种生产走向专门化的趋势逐渐明显，农副业结合的形式对发展手工业生产，将会起阻碍作用。所以在目前条件下——将来工业发展了，农村剩余劳力将大批涌进工厂，组织各种手工业、副业生产合作社，是解决剩余劳力的更好办法。
            四、关于富农问题：
    在新民主主义阶段中，允许城乡资本主义存在，并可以得到必要的发展。在这一条件，农村生产发展后，新的富农的产生是不可避免的，新富农的产生是不可怕的，同时对发展新民主主义的农业经济是有其积极作用的。
    但另一方面的问题是：准许富农经济存在是否准许富农参加劳动互助与合作社呢？准许富农的资本主义的雇佣剥削，但是否准许在半社会主义性的互助组织中进行这种剥削呢？如果准许富农参加劳动互助，又准许这种资本主义剥削呢，那末劳动互助组内部等价交换的生产关系是否会引起改变？这一连串的问题，在老区互助合作运动中虽未成普遍性的问题，但个别富农不采取雇工形式，而在劳动互助中采取了出工资米的形式，以剥削农民组织起来劳动的更大的剩余价值的事实是存在的。
    劳动互助组织是劳动人民的半集体经济组织，富农是农村资产阶级，如果在劳动互助组织中准许富农参加而又准许富农进行资本主义的剥削，那么劳动互助组织内部生产关系的变化是必然的。不等价关系的结果对富农是有利的，但对劳动农民却是不利的。
    解决这一问题，目前尚未找到适当途径，但从发展趋势来看，富农从劳动互助中逐渐分化出去的可能性是极大的。因为在互助中，农民感到这种实际上不等价的关系，对自己发展不利时，促使富农退出互助是可能而应该的。另一可能是当富农感到参加互助不比其雇佣工单干更为有利时，自动退组也是可能的。
    另外我们考虑在几年来生产互助中生长的富农，尚未分化出去的互助组中，以土地收获物之多少，采用劳动积累的方法，以减免富农剥削农民组织起来集体劳动的更大剩余价值，这对劳动农民发展自己经济是有好处的。
    最后应该解决一个问题，即在互助运动中，富农被分化出去，或采取劳动积累的方法，避免富农对劳动农民更大的剥削，是否和准许富农经济存在有矛盾呢？是否排斥富农经济呢？我们认为准许富农存在与农民在互助中不准许富农有不等价的剥削关系存在并不能认为是排斥富农。因为劳动互助的基本原则是等价，损害了这一原则是不对的。同时富农采取雇佣雇工的经营形式，对其发展也是有利的。
