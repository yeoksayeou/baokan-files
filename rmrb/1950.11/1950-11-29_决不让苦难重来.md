　　Never Let Suffering Return
    Bai Tianming
    On the last day of October, in the afternoon, the reporter walked into the smelting plant of the Northeast People's Government Nonferrous Metals Administration. Hundreds of workers were coming out of the bathhouse and walking into the health cafeteria. Here, the state prepares nutritious food for workers in departments that are detrimental to health.
    During the puppet Manchukuo period, to prevent workers from escaping, more than half of the workers here were locked in the prison behind the factory every day after working continuously for twelve hours. But after the Communists came, they began to enjoy the fruits of their hard work; the health cafeteria is just a small part of it. These days, as workers sit in the cafeteria drinking hot milk, the conversation focuses on the war in Korea. The workers deeply feel that the flames of aggression ignited by American imperialism in Korea are increasingly threatening the Chinese people. They do not see it as someone else's business, because the fact that the Japanese invaded Northeast China after occupying Korea is still clearly in their memory. The workers will never allow another aggressor to bring the same disaster back upon their heads. This understanding has become a powerful force and is beginning to be brought into play in all aspects of work.
    Now a production competition is underway in the factory. The competition conditions for each workshop and group fill the pages of bulletin boards and wall newspapers. Worker Fang Qinglu went home once during his day off, but he missed the train when he returned to the factory at night. Knowing that every moment is precious now, he walked a hundred miles back to the factory overnight and worked as usual the next day. It is this enthusiasm that ensures that the attendance rate of many workshops remains between 98% and 100%.
    When the reporter walked into the roasting furnace workshop, an unbearable thick smoke stung his nose, but the workers were constantly turning the roasting pots, sintering copper concentrate into lumps to supply the blast furnace for smelting. From the smoke, there was a faint, morbid cough. It turned out to be Xie Qingshan, the leader of the most productive group in the workshop. He worked here as a beast of burden for nine years under Japanese rule and contracted a tiring tracheitis, which recently relapsed due to the sudden cold weather. When he had to rest, the lump rate of roasted ore in the group dropped from 72% to 35% because there was no one more skilled to master the technology. But the next day, after listening to the factory director's current affairs report, he insisted on working. He said, "Although I can't personally go to help the Korean people fight the American devils, if I can increase the lump rate by 1%, it will be equivalent to weakening American imperialism by one point. I can't just watch the American devils bring disaster back!" Hatred overcame the disease, and the group's roasting lump rate increased again, reaching 85%, exceeding the previous record high.
    In the smelting department, in order to reduce the copper lost with the slag, the workers carefully operated the furnace according to the standard method, and the technicians also squatted beside the furnace to study how to batch the materials. This has further improved the actual copper recovery rate in October compared to September.
    Beside the lead smelting blast furnace, the workers described to the reporter how they overcame difficulties to complete the lead smelting task. The hearth of the blast furnace was just repaired on the 10th. According to normal practice, it would have to wait five days to dry naturally before loading and igniting, but the workers could not wait now. They used fire to bake it. To avoid cracking the furnace and undoing all their previous efforts, they sat beside the furnace all day to take care of it. The drying time was shortened by four days, but the lead ore could not be transported to the factory according to the plan. It was a cruel punishment for the workers to stop work and wait for materials during this period. The entire team searched everywhere for lead ore that the enemy and puppets thought was unsmeltable and abandoned. Some even cleaned up the lead-containing soot in the chimney and loaded it into the furnace. But difficulties arose again. These miscellaneous raw materials contained a large amount of iron oxide, which could only condense on the furnace wall and could not melt at the existing furnace temperature. The volume inside the furnace became smaller and smaller, and the decrease in output increased from 10% to 20%. It was clear that the task was about to be unfulfilled. The workers knew that this phenomenon could be eliminated: one was to increase the flux and increase the furnace temperature, and the other was to stand at the furnace opening at a high temperature of 300 degrees and knock off the condensed material with a drill. After studying the results, they adopted the latter method, because they were unwilling to maintain production by increasing costs. Communist Party member Chi Yujun came to the furnace opening first, and more than twenty people immediately followed. The furnace opening radiated scorching heat. Although they were wearing thick clothes, they still had to take turns. At first, they changed every two minutes, but unconsciously the changing time became three minutes, four minutes, five minutes… up to a quarter of an hour. In the end, even if someone replaced them, the previous person would not go down. The number of people standing at the furnace opening increased from one to two, to three… Later people, because they could no longer squeeze up, had to drag down the people who should have rested long ago. This continued for twenty-four hours, and all the condensed matter attached to the furnace wall was removed, and production returned to normal. When calculated at the end of the month, the output of the lead blast furnace still exceeded the plan by 8.4%.
    Now the goal of the entire factory is to complete the annual production plan ahead of schedule in November.

　　决不让苦难重来
    白天明
    十月最后一天的下午，记者走进东北人民政府有色金属管理局的冶炼厂。成百的工人正从浴室里出来，走进了保健食堂。在这里，国家替有碍身体健康部门的工人准备着富有营养的食品。
    伪满时，日本鬼子为防止工人逃跑，这里有半数以上的工人每天在连续操作十二个小时之后，被关进工厂后面的监狱里。但是从共产党来了之后，他们就开始享受着自己辛勤劳动的果实；保健食堂就是其中的一小部分。这些日子当工人们坐在食堂里喝着熟腾腾的牛奶时，谈话中心集中在朝鲜发生的战事上面。工人们深深感到美帝国主义在朝鲜燃起的侵略战火，正日甚一日地威胁着中国人民。他们并不把它看成为身外事，因为日本人在侵占了朝鲜之后才进犯东北的事实，还清楚地留在记忆里。工人们绝不让另一个侵略者把相同的灾难重新带来压在自己的头上。这种认识已成为一种强大的力量，开始发挥到工作的各方面。
    现在生产竞赛正在厂内开展着。各车间、小组的竞赛条件占满了黑板报、墙报的篇幅。工人方清禄趁公休日回家一次，但晚上回厂时没有赶上火车，他知道现在一时一刻的时间都是宝贵的，所以连夜步行一百里回厂，第二日照常工作。就是这种热情，保证了许多车间的出勤率保持在百分之九十八到百分之百之间。
    当记者走进培烧炉车间时，一种难以忍受的浓烟刺进鼻子，可是工人们却正在不停地翻转着培火锅，把铜矿砂烧结成块，供给鼓风炉熔炼。从烟气中不时传出一个人隐约的、病态的咳嗽声，原来就是车间里生产效率最高的组长解庆山。日本人统治时期他在这里作了九年牛马，染上了累人的气管炎症，最近因为天气骤冷又复发了。当他不得不休息时，组里因为没有更熟练的人掌握技术，培烧矿砂的块率就由百分之七十二降至百分之三十五；但当第二天听了厂长的时事报告后，他又坚持工作了。他说：“我虽然不能亲自去帮助朝鲜人民去打美国鬼子，但是如果能把块率提高百分之一，也就等于削弱美帝国主义的一分力量，我不能眼看着美国鬼子把灾难重新带来！”仇恨战胜了疾病，小组的培烧块率又重新提高起来，而且提高到百分之八十五，超过了以前的最高纪录。
    在熔炼部，工人们为了减少随着矿渣跑掉的铜，在炉上谨慎地按着正规的方法操作，技术人员也蹲在炉旁和工人研究如何配料。这就使十月份熔铜实收率较九月份又有提高。
    在冶铅的鼓风炉旁，工人们向记者描述他们怎样克服困难完成冶铅任务的情景。鼓风炉的前床在十号刚刚修好，按着正常的规律是要等到五天后自然干燥才能装料点火，但是工人们现在却有些不能等待。他们用火来烤，为了怕把炉子烤裂而前功尽弃，他们整天坐在炉旁照管。干燥的时间缩短了四天，可是按计划铅矿石还不能运到。在这个时期停工待料，对于工人真是一件严酷的刑罚。全班的人员就到处搜集敌伪认为不能熔炼而遗弃的铅矿石，有的人更把烟囱里含铅的烟灰都清除来装进炉子里去。可是困难又来了，这些杂乱原料里含有大量的氧化铁，在现有的炉温下只能使其凝结在炉帮上而不能熔化，炉内的容积越来越小了，产量的减少也由百分之十增到百分之二十。眼看任务就要完不成。工人们知道这种现象是可以消除的：一是增加熔剂和提高炉温，一是站在三百度高温的炉口用钎子把凝结的东西敲掉。研究的结果，他们采用了后一个办法，因为他们不愿意用提高成本来保持产量。党员迟玉俊首先来到炉口，后面马上就跟上来二十多个人。炉口辐射出炙人的热力，虽然他们穿着厚厚的衣服，也仍然要轮流接替。起初每隔两分钟一换，不知不觉地更换的时间就变成三分钟、四分钟、五分钟……以至一刻钟，最后即或是有人接替，前一个人也不肯下去，站在炉口的就由一个人增加到两个人、三个人……后来的人因为再也挤不上去，就只有把早该休息的人硬拖下来。这样继续了二十四小时，所有沾在炉帮的凝结物都被清除了，产量又恢复到正常状态。到月底计算，铅鼓风炉的产量仍然超过计划百分之八点四。
    现在全厂的目标是：提前在十一月内完成全年生产计划。
