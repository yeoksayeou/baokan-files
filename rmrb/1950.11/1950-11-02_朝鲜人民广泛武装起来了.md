At present, our Korean people's homeland is facing a crisis. This crisis not only threatens the independence of Korea but also the security of the People's Republic of China, and the freedom and peace of the people of Asia and the world. After landing at Incheon on September 15th, the American aggressors and the Syngman Rhee bandit gang occupied Seoul and Pyongyang, and then massively invaded areas north of the 38th parallel. The American aggressors, intoxicated with "victory" due to their aggressive "achievements," believing that their war aims were about to be achieved, are even more forcefully invading the north. In the occupied areas, the American and Rhee bandits are implementing the most brutal and barbaric fascist "rule," attempting to establish a base for aggression against Asia. In order to destroy the democratic construction and patriotic forces of the North over the past five years, they are implementing a barbaric policy of large-scale slaughter, indiscriminately bombing all cities and villages in the North. American imperialism, which is carrying out robbery and plunder in Korea, is following the old path of Japanese imperialism's aggression against Asia. American imperialism has seriously undermined world peace.

Faced with aggressors who are numerically superior, the young Korean People's Army could not engage in confrontational battles with equal forces and had to make organized and planned withdrawals to preserve their main fighting force.

The Korean War was a domestic war launched by the Syngman Rhee bandit gang at the instigation of American imperialism. The American aggressors underestimated the strength of the Korean people and the people of the world. They naively believed that the Korean War could be easily ended. To "legitimize" the Korean War and to deceive world opinion, the United States used a series of cunning and insidious strategies. But all the American aggressors' attempts at concealment were futile. Documents seized by the Korean People's Army and confessions of high-ranking officials of the captured Syngman Rhee bandit gang clearly tell the people of the world that the Korean Civil War was launched by the South Korean puppet at the instigation of the United States.

The government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea obtained definite intelligence in early May this year that the American and Rhee reactionaries planned to invade the North. Having suffered decades of enslavement and exploitation by Japanese imperialism, the Korean people deeply understand the pain of being slaves and can never tolerate such aggression. The government of the Republic made sincere and patient efforts to peacefully unify the country and avoid a fratricidal civil war. However, the Syngman Rhee bandit gang brazenly disregarded everything and still launched a civil war. This is intolerable to the Korean people.

With the firm support of the people, the Korean People's Army, together with the People's Guerrillas, launched a vigorous offensive southward, quickly liberating Seoul and fighting all the way to the Nakdong River, compressing the American and Rhee bandit troops to the east bank of the Nakdong River and a small area of North and South Gyeongsang Province, inflicting serious blows on the enemy.

In the two months after the start of the war, the Korean People's Army liberated 90 percent of the southern territory. In the 108 liberated counties, 1,186 districts, and 13,654 villages, people's power was generated through democratic elections. As a result of the implementation of land reform, 1,163,000 tenant farmers and landless peasants were given 520,000 hectares of land free of charge. Labor laws and other democratic measures were also implemented simultaneously. The people of the South had their own regime, became masters of the land, and had the conditions to fight for a happy life in the future. In the liberated land, the people destroyed the fascist power base of the Syngman Rhee bandit gang and united into a huge patriotic force.

(II)

At this time, the American aggressors faced a military impasse. The reactionary rule of the United States in Korea was about to completely collapse, and its entire plan of aggression against the mainland would be shattered. The American aggressors then assembled all their forces in the Far East to land at Incheon and invade Seoul. They attempted to cut off the supply lines of the People's Army that had counterattacked to the south end and encircle and annihilate the People's Army; they also attempted to quickly end the "simple war" in Korea, to avoid what American reactionary political commentator Walter Lippmann said "it is unimaginable that the essence of the American army would remain in Korea." But these plans of the American aggressors, like the failures they had suffered in launching a civil war north of the 38th parallel, also fell through.

The heroic Korean People's Army inflicted serious blows on the enemy in the Seoul-Incheon area. The People's Army correctly analyzed the relationship between enemy and ourselves and the specific conditions, and decided to preserve its main force and take steps for an organized retreat. The American aggressors manipulated their United Nations General Assembly voting machine to pass the so-called "Eight-Nation Proposal" to resolve the Korean issue as a cover, and continued to expand the war of aggression.

In the active retreat, the Korean People's Army continually inflicted heavy blows on the enemy's active forces, making the enemy pay a heavy price in blood for every step forward; at the same time, it gradually led the enemy deep into the mountainous areas of northern Korea.

This area is full of towering mountains, which is a favorable area for the Korean people to resist. As American officer Stone, who was captured by the Korean People's Guerrillas, said, "As long as the mountains exist for one day, the Korean people cannot be conquered." From the west coast along the Yalu River to Jiangjie and Qianchuan area is the Yalu River Plateau, composed of the Langlin Mountains and Miaoxiang Mountains, with intricate valleys and dangerous terrain. The central part of the Yalu River bend is the Fuzhan Plateau, which is the remnant of the Baitou Mountain Range, and belongs to the Fuzhan Ridge Mountain Range. The northeast corner is the Motianling Mountain Range.

Currently, the war is taking place in various parts of the north, central, and south. On the west coast, the American and British troops are invading the area north of Pyongyang and the Anzhou and Yongrou areas. The Korean People's Army has repeatedly inflicted heavy damage on the enemy on land and in the air. The Li puppet troops who have penetrated into the Unsan and Bukjin areas have been blocked by the People's Army and are being surrounded and annihilated. On the east coast, the Syngman Rhee bandit troops invaded the area north of Hamhung and Bukcheong, but the puppet army's offensive has been met with a firm counterattack from the People's Army, and the American and Rhee bandit troops are walking into their graves. In order to eliminate the enemy's active forces, the entire territory of Korea has launched a war of all people, fighting for the final victory.

(III)

Faced with such a war situation in the homeland of the Korean people, the time has come for all the Korean people to rise up and launch a resolute struggle against the enemy.

On October 11, General Kim Il-sung issued a solemn call to the people and army of the whole country to respond to the invasion of the American aggressors with "the arming of all the people." He called on them to prepare forces to sweep the foreign armed interventionists and their running dogs, the Syngman Rhee bandit gang, off the territory of the motherland forever. The Korean people warmly responded to this call. Uprising meetings were immediately convened in cities, villages, factories, schools and agencies, determined to follow the path indicated by Premier Kim Il-sung. Workers and farmers shouldered their guns and rushed to the front one after another. They swore: "We will never come back until we have completely driven the enemy out of the country!" They firmly believed that the current serious crisis facing the motherland, like dark clouds covering the sky and wild winds sweeping the fields, would eventually pass.

Many young people have taken up guns. In the hometown of Kim Kun-ok, the famous torpedo boat captain who sank an American cruiser, the young people twice requested General Kim Il-sung to go to the front, saying: "As long as we young people exist for one day, we will never let the enemy trample on the land of our motherland!" Teachers and students of the school destroyed by enemy planes went to the front together, saying: "We cannot repeat the 36 years of slave life." Women have continuously and massively joined the army, shouting: "The enemy is the most brutal beast. They have come in, and we must overcome the crisis of the motherland!" Many cultural workers and religious figures have also joined the army.

The workers and farmers in the enemy-occupied areas completed the transfer work in a timely manner, completed the autumn harvest on time, and paid agricultural taxes in advance to avoid enemy looting and destruction, and supplied more food to the front.

The workers and farmers who remained in the rear and in the base areas were engaged in overproduction. Park Young-bok, a worker in a certain military factory, had already reached three times his past production volume, and now he has reached four times, and decided to increase it to four and a half times. The female workers in the clothing factory increased production to three times or four times. Farmers in various places competed to pay patriotic rice. Farmers in Tieshan County donated 7,000 bags of rice; women donated 10,000 pairs of cotton socks. The working people are increasing production with all their strength to support the people's armed forces in fighting the enemy.

The atrocities committed by the American aggressors and their running dogs in Korea are unprecedented in human history. They slaughtered women and children throughout North and South Korea, destroyed many peaceful cities and villages, and used methods of exterminating people that were hundreds of times more cruel than Hitler's, intending to turn Korea into a Korea without the Korean people. The American aggressors inherited Hitler's mantle of exterminating the human race, attempting to kill all the Korean people and turn Korea into a military base.

Listen to the shameless report of the Associated Press. In the 117 days after the start of the war, they dropped 35,000 tons of bombs in Korea (equivalent to more than ten times the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima), used 27 million rounds of machine gun bullets for strafing, sprinkled 850,000 gallons of gasoline from planes to burn villages, and fired 75,000 rockets.

The people who escaped from the enemy-occupied areas described the barbarous acts of the American and Rhee bandits as appalling. They killed people when they met them, and the stench of corpses permeated everywhere. They exhausted all methods of killing, even gouging out eyes, cutting throats, chopping off hands, burning to death, using death row electric beds and other inhuman means, attempting to use this to eliminate the Korean people and their will to fight.

But what the American and Rhee bandit troops received was not the people's fear but the people's greater and deeper hatred; not surrender to the enemy but more people joining the ranks of battle. Every Korean people thoroughly understood, "If I don't kill the enemy, I can't live!" We must completely and cleanly eliminate the American aggressors and their running dogs! The armed teams of people shouldering guns and rushing to the front will never finish until the last of the 30 million Korean people.

(IV)

In the enemy-occupied areas, the broad masses of the people responded to the enemy's atrocities by participating in the People's Guerrillas on a large scale. They understand that only under the banner of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea can we open up the road to freedom and liberation. The exemplary deeds of countless combat heroes in the People's Army encouraged them. The heroic epic of the eight hundred martyrs of Yue Wei Island who bravely resisted the landing of the huge enemy army, and the deeds of the heroes who bravely defended Seoul, inspired the people's patriotic enthusiasm. Two patriotic girls in Seoul, Li In-sun and Li Qingzi, sisters who volunteered to sign up in the special self-defense force, immediately participated in the battle to defend Seoul. They made contributions to the motherland with their extraordinary composure and courage. They ambushed under the bridge, and when the enemy tank drove over, they quickly jumped out, opened the hatch, and threw a grenade into the car. When the enemy tank exploded and burned, they had run into the streets and entered their defense zone. Each of them destroyed an enemy tank in this way. Such resolute and brave fighting women, like the martyrs on Yue Wei Island, encouraged the people to go to battle and to victory.

In the southern mountainous areas, guerrilla warfare is active everywhere. People went here in groups, preparing for or carrying out guerrilla warfare with all tools and weapons. They have become a well-organized and huge force capable of long-term resistance. Here are officers and soldiers of the People's Army, resolute revenge-seekers from all walks of life whose wives and children were brutally killed by the enemy, and young men and women whose parents were killed. The democratically elected people's committees at all levels are carrying out work in this area, and large areas are still under the control of the people's power.

South and north of Wonsan, the communication lines of the American and Rhee bandit troops were cut off, and a large number of military supplies fell into the hands of the people. In the Muncheon area, at the junction of South Pyongan Province and South Hamgyong Province, and in the mountainous area north of Hamhung, the People's Guerrillas ambushed the enemy troops, causing the enemy to fall into chaos. In the Huachuan area, the people cooperated with the guerrillas to seize highlands and power plants. In the Goseong area, the 12,000 peaks of Mount Kumgang, with its strange rocks and dangerous peaks, are full of base areas for the People's Guerrillas. According to reports from the American and British news agencies, Xiangyang, Samcheok, and Goseong have been re-liberated by the People's Guerrillas. Near Mokpo, east of Seoul, and around Busan and Daegu, there are also powerful people's armed forces operating in the enemy's heartland. The American and Rhee bandit troops sadly admit that there are more enemies in the rear than in the front. The American and Rhee bandit troops have to admit that they are being divided into isolated areas, and are in danger of being ambushed and annihilated at any time. In order to support the Li puppet troops whose offensive north of Hamhung was blocked, the American army had to reinforce troops from the sea, and the puppet troops who invaded forward could only rely on airlifts for supplies. These facts powerfully illustrate that the Korean land is not occupied by them, and their communication lines have been cut off inch by inch. MacArthur's spokesman has publicly admitted that there are many People's Army forces operating behind their lines. The large-scale guerrilla warfare has made the American and Rhee bandit troops feel terrified and has caused them serious losses.

(V)

The blood of patriotic ancestors such as the national heroes Eulji Mundeok and Yi Sun-sin flows in the bodies of the Korean people. We inherit the patriotic tradition of General Kim Il-sung who has overcome difficulties and defeated the Japanese invaders for more than ten years. The Korean nation is an invincible heroic nation. Every soldier in the Korean People's Army, every member of the People's Guerrillas, and every Korean people understands that Korea's war of liberation of the motherland has the support of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China and various people's democratic countries, as well as all progressive mankind. Under the wise leadership of Premier Kim Il-sung and under the banner of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, we, the Korean people, will defend every inch of our motherland's land with our blood and flesh. We are preparing everything and are determined to give the enemy a decisive blow, drive the American aggressors and the Syngman Rhee bandit gang out of our motherland's land, complete the great cause of the liberation of the motherland, and fulfill the task of the front-line combat we shoulder in the struggle to defend human peace, to repay the sympathy and support given to us by the people of the world.

　　朝鲜人民广泛武装起来了
    朝鲜中央通讯社驻华总分社社长金圣容
    （一）
    现在，我们朝鲜人民的祖国正面临着危机。这一危机不仅威胁着朝鲜的独立，也威胁着中华人民共和国的安全，威胁着整个亚洲人民和世界人民的自由与和平。美国侵略者和李承晚匪帮，于九月十五日登陆仁川后，侵据汉城平壤，复大规模地侵犯三八线以北地区。美国侵略者由于他的侵略的“成就”正陶醉于“胜利”中，认为他的战争目的即将达成，因而更加用力地向北侵略。美李匪徒在侵占区，施行着最残酷最野蛮的法西斯“统治”，妄图建立侵略亚洲的基地。他们为了摧毁北部五年来的民主建设和爱国力量，执行着野蛮的大规模屠杀政策，他们无差别地轰炸北部所有的城市与乡村。在朝鲜实行强盗掠夺的美国帝国主义，正走着日本帝国主义侵略亚洲的老路，美国帝国主义已经严重地破坏了世界和平。
    年青的朝鲜人民军面对着数量上占优势的侵略者，不可能以对等的兵力进行对峙的战斗，为了保存战斗主力，不得不作有组织有计划的撤退。
    朝鲜战争是美国帝国主义指使卖国集团李承晚匪帮发动的国内战争。美国侵略者曾过低地估计了朝鲜人民和世界人民的力量。他们天真地认为朝鲜战争可以轻易地结束。为了把朝鲜战争“合法化”，为了欺骗世界舆论，美国曾使用过一连串的奸滑的阴险的策略。但是美国侵略者一切的掩饰的图谋都是徒然的。朝鲜人民军所缴获的文件以及被俘的李承晚匪帮的高级官员的供词，都明确地告诉世界人民：朝鲜内战是美国指使南朝鲜傀儡发动的。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的政府在今年五月初即曾获得确切情报，得悉美李反动派向北部侵犯的计划。曾经受过日本帝国主义数十年奴役和压榨的朝鲜人民，深刻地了解作奴隶的痛苦，决不能忍受这种侵略。共和国政府，为了和平统一祖国，避免同族相残的内战，作了有诚意的耐性的努力。但是李承晚匪帮悍然不顾一切，依然发动了内战。这是朝鲜人民所不能容忍的。
    朝鲜人民军在人民坚决的支援下，协同人民游击队，势如破竹，向南进攻，很快即解放汉城，并一直打至洛东江，将美李匪军压缩至洛东江东岸及庆尚南北道的狭小地区内，予敌人以严重的打击。
    战争开始后的两个多月内，朝鲜人民军解放了南部国土的百分之九十。在解放了的一百零八个县、一千一百八十六个区和一万三千六百五十四个村中，由民主选举产生了人民政权。由于实施土地改革的结果，一百一十六万三千户佃农和无地农民无偿地分得了五十二万町步的土地。劳动法令及其他民主措施也同时实行。南部人民，有了自己的政权，成为土地的主人，有了为今后幸福生活奋斗的条件。在解放的土地上，人民摧毁了李承晚匪帮法西斯的政权基础，团结成为巨大的爱国力量。
    （二）
    这时美国侵略者在军事上面临绝境。美国在朝鲜的反动统治即将全部瓦解，它对大陆的整个侵略计划将遭到破灭。美国侵略者乃纠集他在远东的全部兵力登陆仁川、进犯汉城。他们企图截断反攻至南端的人民军的供给线，围歼人民军；他们也企图迅速结束在朝鲜的“简单的战争”，避免发生像美国反动政论家李普曼所说的“美国军队的精华仍然留在朝鲜是不堪想像的”。但是美国侵略者的这些打算和他们向三八线以北发动内战已遭受的失败一样也都落了空。
    英勇的朝鲜人民军在汉城仁川地区予敌人以严重打击。人民军正确地分析了敌我力量关系和具体条件，决定保存主力，有组织地撤退的步骤。美国侵略者操纵其联合国大会的表决机器，以通过所谓解决朝鲜问题的“八国提案”为掩饰，继续扩大着侵略战争。
    朝鲜人民军在主动撤退中一面予敌有生力量以不断的沉重的打击，使敌人每前进一步，即须付出惨重的血的代价；一面逐渐使敌人深入朝鲜北部的山岳地带。
    这一带地区到处是崇山峻岭，是朝鲜人民进行抵抗的有利地带。正如被朝鲜人民游击队俘虏的美国军官斯东所说，“只要山一天存在，朝鲜人民就被征服不了”。自西海岸起沿着鸭绿江至江界、前川一带为鸭绿江高原，由狼林山脉、妙香山脉组成，山谷错综，形势险要。鸭绿江曲折处的中部一带为白头山余脉的赴战高原，系赴战岭山脉。东北角则为摩天岭山脉。
    目前，战争正在北部、中部及南部各地进行着。在西海岸，美英军向平壤以北地区及安州、永柔地区侵犯，朝鲜人民军在陆地上、天空中接连地重创敌人。向云山、北镇地区深入的李伪军，已为人民军阻止，并正被包围和歼灭中。在东海岸方面，李承晚匪军侵入咸兴、北青以北地区，但伪军的攻势已遭到人民军的坚强的反击，美李匪军正在走进他们的坟墓。为了消灭敌人的有生力量，朝鲜全境展开了全人民的战争，为取得最后胜利而斗争。
    （三）
    朝鲜人民的祖国面临着这样的战争形势，全朝鲜人民奋起对敌展开坚决斗争的时候到来了。
    十月十一日，金日成将军向全国军民发出庄严的号召，以“全人民的武装”回答美国侵略者的进犯。他号召准备力量将外国武装干涉者及其走狗李承晚匪帮永远地自祖国的疆土上扫荡出去。朝鲜人民热烈地响应了这一号召。各城市，各乡村，各工厂，各学校和各机关立刻召开了奋起大会，决心走向金日成首相所指引的道路。工人们，农民们肩起枪来陆续地奔赴前线。他们宣誓说：“不将敌人完全驱逐出境，决不回来！”他们坚决相信，当前祖国面临的严重危机，像遮天的乌云和漫野的狂风一样，有一天终会过去的。
    许许多多的青年拿起枪来了。以击沉美国巡洋舰著名的金君钰鱼雷艇长的家乡，青年们两次向金日成将军请求开赴前线，他们说：“只要我们青年存在一天，就决不让敌人在祖国大地上践踏！”被敌机将校舍炸毁的学校教师和学生们一起出征，他们说：“三十六年的奴隶生活，不能再重复了。”妇女们连续地大量地参军了，她们高呼着：“敌人是最残暴的野兽，他们进来了，我们要克服祖国的危机！”许多文化工作者，宗教界人士，也都参军了。
    敌人侵占区的工人们和农人们，及时完成转移工作，按时地完成秋收，提前缴纳农业税，避免敌人掠夺与破坏，供给前线更多的粮食。
    留在后方和根据地的工人们和农民们，进行着超额的增产工作。某军需工厂的工人朴永福，本已达到过去生产额的三倍，现在已达到四倍，又决定提高到四倍半。在被服工厂的女工们，将生产提高到三倍、四倍。各地农民争先缴纳爱国米。铁山县农民献出七千包大米；妇女献出一万双棉袜。劳动人民以一切力量增加生产，支援着人民的武装向敌人战斗。
    美国侵略者及其走狗在朝鲜制造的暴行是人类历史上空前的。他们在南北朝鲜各地屠杀妇女和儿童，毁灭了许多和平城市与村庄，他们使用着比希特勒还要残酷千百倍的消灭人民的方法，打算将朝鲜变成没有朝鲜人民的朝鲜。美国侵略者继承着希特勒的灭绝人种的衣钵，企图杀绝朝鲜人民，将朝鲜变作军事基地。
    听一听美联社的不知羞耻的报道吧。在战争开始后的一百一十七天内，他们在朝鲜投下了三万五千吨炸弹（相当于投在广岛的原子弹的十多倍），飞机扫射用了二千七百万发机枪子弹，为烧毁村庄用飞机洒下了八十五万加仑的汽油，并射出了七万五千发火箭炮弹。
    从敌占区逃出的人民叙述美李匪徒的残暴行为是令人发指的。他们遇见人就杀害，尸体的腥味到处弥漫着。他们想尽了所有的杀人方法，甚至剜眼、割喉、剁手、烫死、使用杀人电床等惨无人道的手段，企图用此消灭朝鲜人民和他们的战斗的意志。
    但是美李匪军得到的不是人民的畏惧而是人民的更大更深的仇恨；不是向敌人屈服而是更多的人民参加到战斗的行列来。朝鲜每一个人民都彻底地明白了“不杀死敌人，我就不能活下去！”必须全部干净地消灭美国侵略者及其走狗！肩着枪奔赴前线的人民武装队伍，一直到三千万朝鲜人民的最后一个人为止，这支队伍是永也不会走完的。
    （四）
    在敌人侵占区，广大的人民用大规模参加人民游击队的行动回答了敌人的暴行。他们明白：只有在朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的旗帜下，才能开辟走到自由解放的道路。人民军中无数的战斗英雄的模范事迹鼓舞着他们。月尾岛八百名烈士英勇抗击庞大敌军登陆的英雄的史诗，英勇防卫汉城的英雄们的事迹，激励了人民的爱国热忱。汉城两个爱国少女李仁顺和李庆子，姊妹两个在特别自卫队里志愿报名后，即参加防卫汉城战斗。她们以超人的沉着与果敢，为祖国立了功勋。她们埋伏在桥下，敌人坦克车开过来时，即迅速跃出，揭开车盖，将手榴弹投入车内。在敌人坦克车爆炸与燃烧的时候，她们已跑入街巷，进入自己的防地了。她们每人都这样击毁敌人坦克一辆。这样坚决勇敢的战斗的女性，和月尾岛上的烈士一样鼓舞着人民走向战斗、走向胜利。
    南部的山林地区，游击战争到处在活跃。人民成群结队的走到这里，以一切工具和武器准备着或进行着游击战。他们已成为能够进行长期抵抗的有组织的巨大力量。这里有人民军的军官与战士，有妻子儿女遭敌惨杀的坚决复仇的各阶层人民，有父母被杀害的青年男女。民主选举的各级人民委员会在这一带展开工作，成片成片的地区仍归人民政权掌握。
    元山以南及以北地区，美李匪军的交通线被截断，大量军需品落到人民手中。文川地区，平安南道与咸镜南道交界处，咸兴以北的山岳地带，人民游击队夹击敌军，使敌人陷于混乱。华川地区，人民协同游击队争夺高地及发电厂。高城地区的一万二千个山峰的金刚山，它的奇岩与险峰中，到处都有人民游击队的根据地。据美英通讯社报道，襄阳、三陟和高城已重为人民游击队解放。木浦附近，汉城以东，釜山大邱周围，在敌人的心腹区也同样有强大的人民武装在活动。美李匪军悲哀地承认在后方比在前方有更多的敌人。美李匪军不得不承认他们正在被分割成孤立的地区里，随时被夹击、并有被消灭的危险。美军为支持咸兴以北进攻受阻的李伪军，不得不从海上增兵，而向前侵犯的伪军只能靠着空投接济，这些事实都有力地说明了朝鲜的土地并不为他们占有，他们的交通线已经寸断了。麦克阿瑟的发言人，已公开承认在他们的后方有许多股人民军在活动。规模巨大的游击战争，已使美李匪军感到恐惧，并使他们遭受着严重的损失。
    （五）
    朝鲜人民的身体里流着民族英雄乙支文德、李舜臣等爱国先烈的血液。我们继承着金日成将军十余年如一日的克服困难击退日寇百战百胜的爱国传统。朝鲜民族是不可征服的英雄民族。朝鲜人民军中的每一个将士，每一个人民游击队员，每一个朝鲜人民，都明白：朝鲜的祖国解放战争获得苏联、中华人民共和国和各人民民主国家以及所有进步人类的支持。我们朝鲜人民在金日成首相的英明领导和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的旗帜下，将用我们的血和肉保卫祖国的每一寸土地。我们正准备着一切，决给敌人以决定性的打击，将美国侵略者和李承晚匪帮自我们祖国土地驱逐出境，完成祖国解放的伟业，并完成在保卫人类和平的斗争中我们所担负的前方战斗的任务，以报答全世界人民给我们的同情与支援。
