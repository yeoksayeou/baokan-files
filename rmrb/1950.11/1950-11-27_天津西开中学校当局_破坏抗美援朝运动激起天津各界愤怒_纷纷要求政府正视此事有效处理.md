　　Tianjin Xikai Middle School Authorities
    Sabotage the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement, Arousing Anger from All Circles in Tianjin
    All Demand the Government Face This Matter and Handle it Effectively
    [This newspaper reported] The Tianjin Xikai Middle School authorities have consistently harbored hatred for the people and engaged in reactionary activities. During this Resist America, Aid Korea Movement, the school's principal, Wang Jiwu, even used the pretext of "commemorating the October Revolution" to show the American film "Negro Soldier," which contained extremely poisonous elements, and thus engaged in counter-propaganda against the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement. This reactionary behavior has aroused unanimous anger from the entire student body and people from all walks of life in Tianjin, who demand that the government promptly and effectively deal with it.
    The American film "Negro Soldier," which Xikai Middle School Principal Wang Jiwu showed under the pretext of "commemorating the October Revolution," mainly distorted the truth, claiming that the United States treated black people with "equality" and "freedom," that American forces were "powerful" in World War II, and their weapons were "powerful," and negated the decisive role of the people of China and the Soviet Union in defeating the fascist war, instead claiming that "German, Italian, and Japanese fascism were completely defeated by the United States." After watching this film, the students knew it was deceptive propaganda for American imperialism and completely inconsistent with the facts, so they questioned the school authorities. However, the school authorities actually replied, "We must learn from the enemy's strengths," and told the students to learn from the imperialists.
    During the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement, the school authorities not only did not support the teachers and students but instead obstructed and sabotaged the movement. For example, as soon as the Resist America, Aid Korea current affairs study and volunteer activities began, the school authorities ordered them to end and conducted monthly exams. The students requested a postponement of the exams, but the school authorities not only refused but also increased the number of regular classes and conducted pop quizzes, almost every day, so that this patriotic activity was obstructed. In addition, a teacher requested to purchase several Resist America, Aid Korea current affairs cartoons for propaganda purposes, but the school authorities refused to buy them on the grounds that there were no funds (each book only cost six thousand yuan); while the school library consciously displayed Hitler's propaganda, conducting deceptive propaganda on behalf of the fascists. Although the school's teachers and students repeatedly negotiated with Principal Wang Jiwu, requesting that it be sealed up, Wang replied, "Books can be put out casually, whether or not students read them is up to them." He continued to boldly engage in counter-revolutionary propaganda.
    The reactionary behavior of the school authorities has been consistent. On weekdays, they violate the People's Government's education regulations and openly conduct missionary work on campus. They try to suppress progressive teachers and students, while colluding with reactionary teacher Jin Zhaoheng (a member of the Three People's Principles Youth League), using various despicable and shameless means to sow discord among the Youth League members, undermine unity, slander the League branch secretary, and undermine the League's prestige. During National Day, they even hosted a vicious play called "Wiping Butt Commander," which slandered the People's Government and the People's Liberation Army.
    The above-mentioned reactionary behavior of the Xikai Middle School authorities has aroused extreme anger among the entire student body and all sectors of the city. In addition to exposing the reactionary face of the school authorities in Tianjin newspapers, all the students of the school elected representatives to appeal to the Municipal Education Bureau, requesting the government to take prompt and effective action on this incident. The students' righteous demands have received the support of the broad masses of the people. Students from dozens of major universities and middle schools such as Nankai, Beiyang, and Yaohua, as well as members of the No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory, the Kailuan Office Trade Union, the film and theater industry association, Fang Ji, the secretary-general of the Anti-American Aggression Committee, and dozens of citizens, have all written letters of support. The Municipal Student Federation and major universities and middle schools have sent representatives to express their warm regards to the Xikai students. The Tianjin Daily also published an editor's note at the same time, sympathizing with this righteous call and hoping that the relevant authorities will face up to this incident and take effective action.

　　天津西开中学校当局
    破坏抗美援朝运动激起天津各界愤怒
    纷纷要求政府正视此事有效处理
    【本报讯】天津市西开中学当局，一贯仇视人民，进行反动活动，在此次抗美援朝运动中，该校校长王际五竟假借“纪念十月革命节”的名义，放演了含有极大毒素的美国电影《黑人兵》，对抗美援朝运动起了反宣传作用。这种反动行为，激起该校全体学生及天津各界人民一致愤怒，要求政府迅速予以有效的处理。
    西开中学校长王际五借“纪念十月革命节”的名义放演的美国电影片《黑人兵》，主要内容是颠倒黑白，说美国对待黑人是“平等”“自由”的，说美国兵力在第二次世界大战中是如何“强大”，武器如何“厉害”，并且抹煞中苏两国人民在击败法西斯战争中的决定性作用，而说是“德、意、日法西斯完全是被美国打败的”。这个片子，学生们看了后，知道是替美帝作欺骗宣传，与事实完全不符，就去质问校方，但是该校负责当局竟回答说“我们要学习敌人的长处”，要学生向帝国主义者学习。
    在抗美援朝运动中，该校当局不但不予师生以支持，反而进行阻难破坏。如抗美援朝的时事学习和志愿活动刚一开始，学校当局即令结束，进行月考。同学们曾提请延期考试，学校当局不但不允，且加重正课，随堂抽考，几乎无日不考，以致这种爱国活动遭受了阻难。此外，有一教员要求购买几本抗美援朝时事漫画，以便进行宣传，该校当局竟以没有经费（每本只需六千元）拒绝购买；而该校图书馆内却有意识地公开展览着希特勒的宣传品，代法西斯进行欺骗宣传。该校教师和同学虽迭次与校长王际五交涉，要求封存，而王竟答以“书籍可以随便放，看不看可听同学自便”。依旧大胆进行反革命宣传。
    该校当局的反动行为一贯如此。平日违反人民政府教育规程，在校内公开进行传教。设法打击进步教员与进步学生，同时勾结反动教员金兆珩（三青团员），施展种种卑鄙无耻的手段，在青年团员中进行挑拨离间，破坏团结，诽谤团支书，破坏团的威信。在国庆节时竟主持演出恶毒话剧“擦屁股司令”，诽谤人民政府和解放军。
    以上所述西开中学当局反动的行为，激起了全校学生和全市各界的极端愤怒。该校全体同学除在天津报纸揭露校当局的反动面目外，并推选代表向市教育局呼吁，要求政府对此一事件予以迅速有效的处理。学生们的这种正义要求，获得广大人民的支持。南开、北洋、耀华等数十大中学校学生及棉纺二厂、开滦办事处工会、影剧业公会全体会员、反美侵略委会秘书长方纪及市民数十人，都纷纷写信支持，市学联、大中学并派代表热烈慰问西开同学，天津日报同时发表按语，同情这一正义呼声，希望有关当局正视这一事件，并作有效的处理。
