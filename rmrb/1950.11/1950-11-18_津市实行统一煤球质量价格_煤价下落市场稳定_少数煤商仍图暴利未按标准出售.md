　　Tianjin Implements Unified Coal Briquette Quality and Price
　　Coal Prices Drop, Market Stabilizes
　　A Few Coal Merchants Still Seek Excessive Profits and Fail to Sell According to Standards
　　[Report from this newspaper] According to the agreement reached between the Tianjin Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce and representatives of coal merchants from various districts, the unified coal briquette quality and price began to be implemented on November 2nd. On the 2nd, many coal merchants in various districts had lowered the price to 90 yuan per jin, and posted notices at the entrance indicating the quality and price. The prices of lump and pulverized coal also began to fall. For example, small hard coal lumps, which had previously been as high as 170 yuan per jin, had fallen to 140 yuan on the 2nd. At the same time, the public's impulse to rush to buy coal also eased.

　　However, on the other hand, standard coal briquettes were still not widely available in various districts on the 2nd. Many coal merchants have not abandoned the idea of seeking excessive profits. Some made excuses that they did not have time to make standard coal briquettes and sold wet coal briquettes, while others stopped selling altogether. Coal briquettes of extremely poor quality in the past were also taken out and sold as standard coal briquettes. Selling at 130 or 140 yuan per jin had not completely stopped. Some stores stopped selling high-priced coal briquettes, but continued to make sales through external deliveries, still at 130 yuan per jin. Others used the excuse that they were fulfilling previous orders from customers and continued to sell at 130 or 140 yuan. These phenomena have violated the interests of the broad masses of citizens, and speculators must be severely punished.

　　津市实行统一煤球质量价格
    煤价下落市场稳定
    少数煤商仍图暴利未按标准出售
    【本报讯】根据津市工商局与各区煤商代表协议决定，统一煤球质量及价格自十一月二日起开始实行。二日各区不少煤商已将价格落到每斤九十元，并在门口贴出纸条标明质量价格。块、末煤的价格亦开始下落，如小硬煤块过去每斤曾高达一百七十元，二日已有落至一百四十元的。与此同时，市民的争购心理亦转缓和。
    但另一方面，标准煤球二日仍未能在各区普遍购到。许多煤商仍未放弃图谋暴利的思想。有的借口标准煤球来不及打，卖湿煤球，有的则停售。过去质量极次的煤球亦有拿出来作标准煤球卖。继续卖一百三、四十元一斤的仍未完全停售。有的门市停售高价煤球，即作外送买卖，每斤仍是一百三。还有借口系以前用户之订货，仍继续卖一百三、四十元的。这些现象已违反广大市民利益，必须予投机分子以严厉处分。
