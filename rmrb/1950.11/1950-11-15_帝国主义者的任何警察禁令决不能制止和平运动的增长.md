Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 12th TASS: The newspaper "Izvestia" today published an editorial entitled "Strive for World Peace!", writing: The movement to defend peace has now reached the stage of holding the Second World Peace Congress, and has grown stronger and larger in strength and scale. Vivid proof of the growing power of this movement is the signature campaign for the Stockholm Peace Appeal. The approximately 500 million signatures already collected for the declaration are a serious force and a powerful warning to the warmongers, and also evidence of the firm determination of the people of all countries to save mankind from destruction by modern cannibals.

Izvestia emphasized: The struggle currently being waged by the people of all countries is not only to ban atomic weapons, but also to strive for universal disarmament, ban all war propaganda, and oppose armed aggression and foreign interference in the internal affairs of various countries.

The Soviet people unanimously signed the Stockholm Declaration, they support peace, and resolutely defend the cause of peace. The Soviet people earnestly instructed their representatives attending the Second World Peace Congress to announce at the meeting: They are consistently loyal to the cause of peace, and they are willing to steadfastly and unswervingly fight side by side with all peace fighters in all countries to stop the threat of war and to achieve a stable and lasting peace. All progressive mankind knows: The Soviet people are consistent in word and deed, and the Soviet Union can be trusted in the struggle for peace.

Izvestia continued: The Soviet Union has always unswervingly striven for peace, friendship and cooperation between the people of all countries in the world. Comrade Stalin has repeatedly pointed out that differences in economic systems and ideas do not hinder cooperation and normal relations between the Soviet Union and capitalist countries. The Soviet government resolutely adheres to the international relations system jointly established with various countries after the victory over fascist Germany and imperialist Japan, in order to ensure international peace and security. The foundation of this system is the Potsdam Agreement and the United Nations Charter.

The imperialists' distortion of the Soviet Union's peace-loving policy, saying that this policy is propaganda, a deception, etc., will never succeed. It is now difficult to deceive the people of all countries. The rulers of the United States and Britain, using every possible means, cannot escape the Soviet government's repeated frank and aboveboard proposals aimed at opposing the launching of a new war and expanding international mutual assistance and cooperation.

Izvestia wrote: The policy of launching a new war is currently being implemented by the imperialist camp, led by the ruling groups in the United States. American imperialists are now desperately seizing world hegemony, planning to overthrow the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries in the Third World War, and suppress the workers' and national liberation movements around the world, thereby obtaining this hegemony. These mortal enemies of the people of all countries, who are now engaged in destroying the international mutual assistance and cooperation system and rallying aggressive blocs, are frantically arming themselves and their vassal states, which is not surprising; they are unwilling to seek a way to agreement, and they believe that anything conducive to peace is fatally dangerous to themselves, which is also not surprising.

The unstoppable movement of the current era—the movement of the people of all countries in the world to strive for peace—makes the warmongers resent with beastly hatred. The imperialists and their right-wing social democratic running dogs are doing everything despicable and shameless in their futile attempts to suppress and stifle this movement. The ruling groups of capitalist countries, following Washington's instructions, are doing everything possible to sabotage the Second World Peace Congress. On the one hand, the US authorities refused to issue exit passports to American representatives, and on the other hand, the American running dogs in Cuba illegally arrested Latin American representatives who were passing through Cuba to attend the conference. In other countries that rely on the United States, peace supporters have also suffered brutal persecution. But the British Labor government maintains the best record of flattering war makers. The Labor leaders, who boast of "democratization," were forced by public opinion to allow the Second World Peace Congress to be held in Sheffield, England, but they are now implementing unprecedented police tyranny. The British authorities refused to issue entry visas to most of the Soviet delegation. The same is true for delegations from people's democratic countries and many other countries. French and Italian representatives are also not allowed to enter the UK, although according to existing agreements between these countries and the UK, they do not need entry visas to enter the British Isles. Among those refused entry into the UK are members of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress, headed by the famous scientist Joliot-Curie. Curie was arrested by British police upon arrival in Dover and later sent out of the UK.

The actions of the British authorities have aroused the anger and contempt of all honest people in Britain and around the world.

The Izvestia editorial pointed out: However, no police ban by the imperialists can stop the growth of the powerful peace movement. They cannot sabotage the Second World Peace Congress. The press communique issued today by the Executive Bureau of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress appropriately assessed the actions of the British government, considering that it has in fact prohibited the congress from being held in Britain, and reported that the Second World Peace Congress will be held in Warsaw from the 16th to the 21st.

Izvestia concluded: The movement to defend peace cannot be defeated, because it is a movement of hundreds of millions of people around the world, because our heroic people are at the forefront of this movement, and because the people's struggle for peace is inspired by the leader and teacher of all progressive mankind, the banner of peace - the great Stalin.

### 帝国主义者的任何警察禁令决不能制止和平运动的增长

专栏：“消息报”评论

　　帝国主义者的任何警察禁令决不能制止和平运动的增长       
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科十二日电：今日的消息报以《争取世界和平！》为题发表社论，写道：保卫和平运动现在已达到举行第二届世界保卫和平大会的阶段，在力量与规模上都已成长壮大起来了。这个运动的成长威力的生动证明，就是斯德哥尔摩和平宣言的签名运动。业已为宣言征集的五亿左右的签名，乃是对于战争贩子的一种严重力量与有力的警告，也是各国人民挽救人类使其免遭现代吃人生番毁灭的坚定决心的证据。
    消息报强调称：现在各国人民正在进行着的斗争，不仅要争取禁止原子武器，而且同时还要争取普遍裁减各种军备、禁止各种战争宣传、并反对武装侵略与外来的对各国内政的干涉行动。
    苏联人民一致在斯德哥尔摩宣言上签名，他们拥护和平，并坚决保卫和平事业。苏联人民谆谆嘱咐他们参加第二届世界保卫和平大会的代表们到会上去宣布：他们一贯忠实于和平事业，他们愿意坚定不移地并且不屈不挠地与各国一切和平战士并肩为制止战争威胁、为取得稳固的持久和平而斗争。全体进步人类都知道：苏联人民是言行一致的，在争取和平的斗争中苏联是可以信赖的。
    消息报继称：苏联始终不渝地争取全世界各国人民之间的和平、友好与合作。斯大林同志曾再三指出：经济制度与思想的歧异并不妨碍苏联与资本主义国家之间的合作与正常关系。苏联政府坚决遵行在战胜法西斯德国与帝国主义日本以后，与各国所共同确立的国际关系制度，借以保证国际和平与安全。这个制度的基础就是波茨坦协定与联合国宪章。
    帝国主义者所作曲解苏联的爱好和平政策，说这种政策是宣传、是骗局等种种活动，决不会成功的。现在要欺骗各国人民，是困难的。美英两国的统治者，用尽千方百计，也逃不脱苏联政府屡次所提旨在反对发动新战争并扩展国际互助合作的直率而磊落的建议。
    消息报写道：发动新战争的政策，现正由以美国统治集团为首的帝国主义阵营施行着。美帝国主义者现正拚命夺取世界霸权，计划着在第三次世界大战中来推翻苏联和人民民主国家，镇压全世界的工人和民族解放运动，从而取得这种霸权。这些现在正在从事毁灭国际互助合作制度，纠合侵略集团的各国人民的死敌，正在把他们自己和他们的附庸国穷凶极恶地武装起来，这是无足为奇的；他们不愿寻求协议之道，他们认为任何有利于和平的事物都对他们自己有致命的危险，这也是无足为奇的。
    现时代不可镇压的运动——世界各国人民争取和平的运动——使得战争贩子们悻悻然发出兽性的憎恨。帝国主义者和他们的右翼社会党走狗们，在进行镇压并扼杀这种运动的徒然企图中，是什么卑鄙无耻的事都干得出来的。资本主义各国的统治集团，奉行着华盛顿的指使，正无所不用其极地破坏第二届世界保卫和平大会。一方面美国当局拒绝发给美国代表的出境护照，另一方面古巴的美国走狗们非法逮捕了道经古巴前往参加大会的拉丁美洲代表们，在其他仰美国鼻息的国家内，和平拥护者也遭受了残暴的迫害。但是英国工党政府保持着奉承战争制造者的最优纪录。素以“民主化”自夸的工党领袖们为舆论所迫，不得不让第二届世界保卫和平大会在英国设菲尔德城举行，但是他们现在正施行前所未闻的警察专横手段。英国当局拒绝发入境签证给苏联代表团的大部分代表。对人民民主国家和许多其他国家的代表团也是这样。法意代表也不准进入英国，虽然根据这些国家与英国的现存协定，他们进入英伦三岛是不需要入境签证的。被英国拒绝入境的人们中有著名科学家约里奥——居里为首的世界保卫和平大会常设委员会的委员们。居里抵达多维尔时，即被英国警察拘捕，后来被送出英国。
    英国当局的行为已引起了英国本土及全世界所有正直人民的愤怒与鄙视。
    消息报社论指出：可是，帝国主义者的任何警察禁令决不能制止强大的和平运动的增长。它们不能够破坏第二届世界保卫和平大会。世界保卫和平大会常设委员会执行局今日发表的公报适当地估计了英国政府的行动，认为它事实上已禁止大会在英国举行，并报道第二届世界保卫和平大会将于十六日到二十一日在华沙举行。
    消息报结语称：保卫和平运动是无法击破的，因为这是全世界千百万人民的运动，因为我们英勇的人民走在这个运动的最前列，因为人民争取和平的斗争是受到全体进步人类的领袖和导师、和平的旗手——伟大的斯大林所鼓舞的。
