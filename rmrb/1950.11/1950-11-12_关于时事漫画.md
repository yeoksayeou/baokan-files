　　On Current Affairs Cartoons
　　Wang Chaowen
    With soaring enthusiasm for resisting America and aiding Korea to defend our homes and country, many young friends who are not accustomed to creating current affairs cartoons are bravely and enthusiastically producing them. This is a very good phenomenon because it meets the needs of the broad masses of the people. Who dares to say that countless Kukryniksy (note) will not emerge from this? Who dares to say that through continuous hard work, countless strong New China cartoon fighters cannot be trained?

    But now, many young friends feel difficulties and are unfamiliar with the weapon of cartoons. First, they cannot grasp the theme, and second, their expressive ability is insufficient. This is inevitably related to insufficient cultivation of political and artistic levels, and insufficient mastery of current affairs materials. But there is no need to worry about this. The enemy has seriously threatened the security of the motherland, and we cannot wait until all conditions are met before bravely engaging in creation; on the contrary, like many artists who were tempered in practical work during the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation, we can gradually learn to master this weapon in the task of resisting America and aiding Korea to defend our homes and country. If too many worries hinder our work and the improvement of cartoons, that is also not good. Like other undertakings, as long as we learn with an open mind, we will definitely go from not knowing to knowing, from not good enough to very good.

    The so-called "don't worry too much" certainly does not mean that you can be casual when using this weapon. How to use the weapon skillfully, accurately, and without hurting our own people, you must be serious, cautious, and solemn before and during the action.

    Some works treat the enemy as an insignificant little toy that can be kicked away with one foot and knocked down with one punch. Although they express their hatred and contempt for the enemy, they cannot forcefully convince the reader. If, because the decadent and corrupt enemy is not accurately attacked, the mood of contempt is fostered, it does not meet the purpose of educating the masses. Some works only depict adults marching forward holding big flags, shouting the slogan "Defend our homes and country," and although they express the correct views of the author, they lack a very touching effect. This is not only due to the formulaic expression, but more importantly because the author has not fully stated the enemy's weaknesses and has not fully stated our strength. The main reason for not being able to fully state the enemy's weaknesses and our strength is that one's own understanding of the enemy and ourselves is insufficient, so one has to resort to the expression of vague concepts. Of course, cartoons should be more concise, more generalized, and more concentrated than facts, but if they are so vague that they cannot inspire readers to associate the enemy's weaknesses and our strength, then it cannot be regarded as vividly attacking the enemy and praising ourselves, and at the same time, it cannot convincingly persuade the reader. Some works, due to the author's lack of analysis of the phenomenon and failure to comprehensively consider the essential meaning of this phenomenon and how to obtain better publicity results, isolate the phenomenon of the people being killed, bombed, and raped by the enemy, one-sidedly emphasizing the pain, fear, and sorrow of those who have not died, thus objectively creating the side effect of fearing the enemy. If this kind of subject matter is appropriately and vividly described, it will of course arouse the masses' hatred for the enemy even more, but some works have not done so. This is not just a question of whether the expressive ability is sufficient, but a question of insufficient understanding. Strictly speaking, it should be said that it is a matter of creative attitude, even a matter of consciousness.

    Too much worry and restraint are wrong, and relying solely on enthusiasm or even personal interest without seriously considering the objective effect cannot gradually improve one's own creation.

    Seriously speaking: Current affairs cartoons should be like a key, helping the masses in a timely manner to unlock difficult locks and solve problems that the masses urgently need to solve. Current affairs cartoons should be like prophecies, predicting the prospects of reality development and enhancing the masses' determination and confidence to transform reality. When it reflects current affairs issues, it can of course grasp one aspect, and it is not necessary to encompass everything from ancient times to the present, but it cannot fail to allow readers to connect with the whole picture. When it solves problems, it does not depart from vivid images, but it must be able to "talk" out a correct principle according to the needs of the masses. When it predicts the future, although it does not need to narrate the process of how reality will develop like a novel, it must inspire readers to grasp the future. If it cannot predict the future prospects, cannot solve problems, and cannot raise problems, then it loses the guiding role that current affairs cartoons should have. No matter what the skills are, the masses will not be very welcome. If the theme of the work not only fails to help the masses to make their thoughts clearer and their will stronger, but on the contrary makes their thoughts more chaotic, the masses will definitely refuse to accept such cartoons, and the key will become scrap iron.

    Cartoons can better complete their due guiding tasks on current affairs issues, first of all, of course, they must master sufficient materials. If they are not familiar with more materials, their imagination is prone to depletion, and fresh images are difficult to produce. Secondly, it requires the author to possess keen, clear, and correct perception and discrimination, to have a deep analysis of the current situation, to have an appropriate estimate of the effect of the work, and to be good at distinguishing what kind of subject matter is suitable for current needs. Finally, it is to seek appropriate forms of expression. Among these, what is more important is to use the correct viewpoint to study what is moving towards victory and what is moving towards extinction from the constantly changing current affairs. If the author's understanding lags behind the masses, it is impossible to correctly introduce current affairs and credibly predict the future. Sharply exposing the essence from the phenomenon, inspiring and enlightening the masses' patriotic and internationalist thoughts and feelings, and mobilizing and organizing the masses to join the sacred struggle to resist America and aid Korea, is a major and arduous task, and we must redouble our efforts to improve ourselves. This ability cannot be obtained immediately, but we must work towards this direction.

    For example: The American imperialists manipulated the United Nations machinery, and the representatives of the vassal states followed it, so that the legitimate demands of the Soviet Union and other new democratic countries were not supported by the majority of representatives in the conference. This is a fact. This fact superficially shows that the strength of the peace camp is very weak and the strength of the aggression camp is very strong, and not all the masses can clearly recognize its essence and remove all worries. Therefore, there is a necessary reason to use current affairs cartoons to educate the masses. However, if the cartoonist lacks a correct understanding of the above-mentioned conference phenomenon and records it one-sidedly and statically, then not only will it not consolidate the masses' confidence that the peace force will certainly be able to defeat the aggressors, but it is also likely to bring thoughts of fearing the United States to some of the masses or fuel the fear of the United States in some of the masses. Conversely, if the author does not stop his eyes within this conference and masters more materials, considering the problem in a connected and developing way from the comparison of the number and quality of peace-loving people all over the world, then the conclusion of who is stronger and who is weaker between the enemy and us will be very different.

    The cartoon "Who is the Majority?" published in the People's Daily on August 12 is an author who has a high degree of hatred for American imperialism and is not confused by the conference phenomenon. He correctly recognized the essence of this phenomenon, sharply revealed it, clearly told the readers who is strong and who is weak, and predicted the prospects of who will win and who will lose, so that he can help the masses clearly recognize this phenomenon and truly play the role of unlocking the lock in thought. Some soldiers believe that reading such cartoons is equivalent to attending a political class, which is not an exaggerated encouragement, because it plays a role in helping to solve problems in current affairs education. Such cartoons are good in that they grasp the essence of real events on the one hand and understand the current needs of the masses on the other hand. It does not record phenomena flatly, nor does it call out a certain slogan in a formulaic way. In a word: it accurately reflects reality and educates the masses in a timely manner. "Who is the Majority?" is an outstanding work. It is full of the combativeness of current affairs cartoons. It not only generally expresses the revolutionary's spirit of optimism in not fearing any difficulties, credibly shows the indestructible and powerful force of the anti-imperialist camp, and predicts the different futures of the enemy and us, but what is more valuable is that it answers a specific question about the fate of all mankind that the masses are concerned about in a timely and clear manner. Use this specific evidence to educate readers, so that readers firmly believe in the inevitable trend of real development. It seizes the enemy's weaknesses, hits the enemy's vital points, and gives a serious and sharp meaningful ridicule, allowing readers to clearly understand: in the current great struggle to defend peace and aggression, it is not we who should be afraid, but the enemy themselves. Such works are by no means painless "occasional essays."

    When there is a great need in objectively to improve the understanding and feelings of hatred, contempt, and disdain for American imperialism, such cartoons are an example for young friends who are enthusiastic about learning and creating current affairs cartoons. Of course, the significance worth learning is not as a model for copying, but as a good example of fully mastering materials, correctly analyzing materials, affirming what problems will be solved for the masses, seriously estimating the political impact, and solemnly engaging in production.

    The people expect and welcome such cartoons, and such cartoons will definitely gradually increase. Young friends who are brave in delving into research should and will be able to continuously improve their ability to understand and express current affairs in the sacred propaganda work, and produce more combative current affairs cartoons.

    Note: Kukryniksy is the joint pen name of three Soviet cartoonists who work collectively. They have the title of "Honored Art Workers."

　　关于时事漫画
　　王朝闻
    抗美援朝保家卫国的热情高涨，许多不习惯作时事漫画的青年朋友们勇敢地热情地制作着时事漫画。这是很好的现象，因为它符合广大人民的需要。这中间，谁敢说不会有无数库克雷尼克赛（注）产生？谁敢说在不断的努力工作中不能锻炼出无数坚强的新中国的漫画战斗员？
    但现在，不少青年朋友感到困难，对于漫画这一武器感到生疏。第一是不会把握主题，第二是表现能力不足。这不会不是与政治水平艺术水平的修养不足有关，和对于时事的材料掌握不足有关。但这无须顾虑。敌人已经严重地威胁到祖国的安全，我们不能等待各种条件具备了才勇敢从事创作；正相反，如同抗日战争解放战争中许多从实际工作中锻炼出来的美术家一样，可以在抗美援朝保家卫国的任务中逐步学会掌握这一武器。假如顾虑太多而束手束脚，妨碍了当前的工作，也妨碍了漫画的提高。如同其他事业一样，只要虚心学习，一定可以从不会到会，从不够好到很好。
    所谓不要太多顾虑，当然不是说在使用这一武器时可以随随便便。如何才能把武器使用得灵便、准确、而且不伤害自己人，在动手之前和动手的时候，必须认真、谨慎、严肃。
    有些作品，把敌人当成不堪一击的小玩意儿，一脚可以踢出去，一拳可以打倒它；虽然表现了自己对于敌人的仇视、蔑视的感情和态度，却不能有力地说服读者。如果由于没有中肯地攻击着堕落和腐朽的敌人，而助长轻视的情绪，也不符合教育群众的目的。有些作品，只画着大人举着大旗前进，叫出“保家卫国”的口号，虽然表示了作者正确的主张，但缺乏十分感人的效果。这不仅由于表现形式的公式化，更重要的由于作者没有充分说出敌人的弱点和没有充分说出我们的力量。不能充分说出敌人的弱点和我们的力量，主要由于自己对敌我缺乏足够的认识，所以不得不借助于空泛的概念的表现方法。当然，漫画应该比事实更扼要、更概括、更集中，但空泛到了不能启发读者联想出敌人的弱点和我们的力量的程度，那就算不得形象地攻击着敌人和歌颂着自己，同时也不能可信地说服着读者。有些作品，由于作者对于现象缺乏分析，没有全面地考虑这一现象的本质意义和如何才能获得较好的宣传效果，孤立地记录着人民被敌人残杀、轰炸、强奸的现象，片面地强调未死者的痛苦、恐惧与悲哀，因而在客观上造成恐惧敌人的副作用。这种题材，如果适当地形象地加以描写，当然更能激起群众对于敌人的仇恨，但有些作品，却没有这样做。这不只是表现能力够不够的问题，而是认识不足的问题。严格检讨起来，应该说是创作态度问题，甚至是意识问题。
    太多顾忌而束手束脚是不对的，仅凭热情甚至仅凭个人兴趣，不严肃地考虑客观效果也不能逐步提高自己的创作。
    认真说来：时事漫画应该像一把钥匙，及时地帮助群众打开疑难的锁，解决群众迫切需要解决的问题。时事漫画最好像预言，预示着现实发展的前景，增强群众改造现实的决心和必胜的信心。它在反映时事问题时当然可以抓住一面，不必上下古今全部包罗，但总不能不使读者联系全面。它在解决问题时不离开生动的形象，但却必须是能够按照群众需要，“谈”出一个正确的道理。它在预示前景时虽不必像小说一样叙述着现实将如何发展的过程，却必须启示读者把握将来。假如它不能预示将来的远景，不能解决问题和提不出问题，那就失掉了时事漫画应有的指导作用。不论技巧如何，群众不会十分欢迎。假如作品的主题不仅不能帮助群众使得思想更明彻，意志更坚强，相反地使得思想更混乱，群众一定拒绝接受这样的漫画，钥匙就成了废铁。
    漫画能够在时事问题上较好地完成应有的指导任务，首先当然要掌握充分材料，不熟悉较多材料，想像能力容易枯竭，新鲜的形象很难产生。其次，要求作者具备着敏锐的明彻的正确的感受力和辨别力，对现状有深刻的分析，对作品的效果要有恰当的估计，善于区别什么才是切合当前需要的题材。最后才是寻求适当的表现形式。这中间，比较重要的是用正确的观点，从不断变化的时事中，研究出什么是正在走向胜利，什么是正在走向灭亡。假如作者的认识落后于群众，要正确地介绍时事和可信地预示发展的前景是不可能的。尖锐地从现象中揭发本质，激励和启发群众爱国主义与国际主义的思想感情，动员与组织群众投入抗美援朝的神圣斗争，是一个重大而艰巨的任务，我们必须加倍努力，提高自己。这种能力不能立刻获得，但必须向这一方向努力。
    比如：美帝国主义者操纵联合国机器，附庸国代表跟着它走，使得苏联及其它新民主主义国家代表的正当主张在会议中得不到多数代表的支持，这是事实。这种事实，表面上显得和平阵营的力量很薄弱，侵略阵营的力量很强大，不是所有群众都能明确地认识到他的本质，去除一切忧虑。因此，就有使用时事漫画来教育群众的必要的理由。但，假如漫画家对于上述的会场现象缺乏正确理解，片面地静止地加以记录，这样就不仅不能巩固群众和平力量一定能够战胜侵略者的信心，而且很可能给某些群众带来恐美的思想或助长了部分群众的恐美病。与此相反，假如作者不把眼光停止在这一会场之内，掌握了更多的材料，联系地和发展地从全世界爱好和平者的数量和质量的对比来考虑问题，那末，敌我力量谁大谁小的结论就很不一样。
    八月十二日人民日报所发表的漫画《谁是多数？》就是对美帝有高度仇恨和不被会场现象所迷惑的作者，正确地认识到这一现象的本质，而尖锐地加以揭发，明确地告诉读者到底谁强谁弱，并预示着谁胜谁败的前景，因而才能够帮助群众明确地认识这一现象，真正发挥了在思想上开锁的作用。某些战士认为读了这样的漫画等于上了一堂政治课，这并不是夸张的鼓励，因为它在时事教育上发挥了帮助解决问题的作用。这样的漫画，好在一方面把握得住现实事件的本质，一方面很懂得群众当前的需要，它不平板地记录现象，也不是公式地叫着某一口号。一句话：恰恰是正确反映了现实和及时地教育着群众。《谁是多数？》是出色的作品。它充满了时事漫画的战斗性。它不仅不是一般地表现了革命者不怕任何困难的乐观主义精神，十分可信地显示出反帝阵营的不可摧毁的强大力量，预示着敌我不同的前途，更可贵的是对于当前群众所关心的关系全人类命运的一个具体问题，恰合时宜地明确地加以解答。用这一具体的证据来教育读者，使读者坚信现实发展的必然趋向。它抓住敌人的弱点，击中了敌人的要害，而给予又严肃又锋利的意味深长的嘲笑，让读者明确体会：在目前保卫和平与侵略的大斗争中，应该恐惧的不是我们，而是敌人自己。这样的作品决不是不痛不痒的“应景文章”。
    当客观上很需要提高仇视、鄙视、蔑视美帝的认识和感情时，这样的漫画是热心学习和制作时事漫画的青年朋友的榜样。当然，值得借鉴的意义不是作为临摩的范本，而是充分掌握材料，正确地分析材料，肯定将为群众解决什么问题，认真地估计政治影响，严肃地从事制作的好榜样。
    人民期待和欢迎这样的漫画，这样的漫画一定会逐步增加。勇于钻研的青年朋友们应该而且一定能够在神圣的宣传工作中不断提高自己对时事的认识能力与表现的能力，产生更有战斗性的时事漫画。
    注：库克雷尼克赛是苏联三位集体创作的漫画家的联合笔名。有“光荣的艺术工作者”的称号。
