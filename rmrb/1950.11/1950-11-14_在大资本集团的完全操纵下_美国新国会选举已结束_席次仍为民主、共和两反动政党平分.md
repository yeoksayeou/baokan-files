　　Under the Complete Manipulation of Large Capital Groups
　　US New Congressional Elections Have Ended
　　Seats Still Evenly Divided Between the Democratic and Republican Reactionary Parties
Xinhua News Agency, 10th: The results of the United States' 82nd Congressional elections, held on the 7th, once again prove the hypocrisy of so-called American democracy. As generally expected, under the complete manipulation of large capital groups, the seats in this new Congress are still evenly divided between the Democratic and Republican parties, who are birds of a feather. The Associated Press reported the congressional seats after the election as follows: Senate: Democratic Party 49 seats, Republican Party 47 seats; House: Democratic Party 234 seats, Republican Party 200 seats, so-called "independent" one seat. Compared with the 81st Congress, the new Congress is even more characterized by its uniformly reactionary nature. Due to the reactionary parties combining their forces, the only progressive Labor Party Congressman in the 81st Congress, Marcantonio, has been defeated. This completely stifles the only voice of justice in Congress.

　　在大资本集团的完全操纵下
　  美国新国会选举已结束           
　　席次仍为民主、共和两反动政党平分
    【新华社十日讯】七日举行的美国第八十二届国会选举的结果，再次证明美国所谓民主的虚伪性。如一般所预料，在大资本集团的完全操纵下，这次新国会的席次，仍为一邱之貉的民主和共和两大反动政党所平分。合众社报道选举后国会的席次如下：参院：民主党四十九席，共和党四十七席；众院：民主党二百三十四席，共和党二百席，所谓“独立”分子一席。与八十一届国会比较，新国会则更以清一色反动为其特点。由于反动党派纠合了它们的力量，八十一届国会中唯一进步的劳工党众议员马肯托尼奥已落选。这从而完全窒息了国会中唯一的正义呼声。
