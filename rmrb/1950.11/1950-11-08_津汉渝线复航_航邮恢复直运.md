Following the temporary suspension of the Civil Aviation Administration's Tianjin-Hankou-Chongqing route, airmail destined for Chongqing was rerouted via the China-Soviet route with transshipment in Xi'an. Now that the flights on this route have resumed operation since October 31st, all airmail destined for the Southwest region will be directly transported by the direct flights starting from the same day.

　　津汉渝线复航
    航邮恢复直运
    前因民航局津汉渝航线一度暂停，去渝航邮乃改由中苏航线带运西京转运，兹以该线班机，已自十月三十一日起恢复，所有去西南航空邮件，已自同日起交由直达航机带运。
