The soldiers advancing into Tibet have created a joyful camp life on the Kangzang Plateau, more than 3,000 meters above sea level. The banks of the Yalong River, the Jinsha River, and the Lancang River have all been campsites for the soldiers. The patches of green tents there are the warm homes of the soldiers on their march. They not only transformed these tents to withstand the high plateau's violent winds and rain, but also created beautiful campsites.

When the soldiers set up camp by the river, they built roads in front of the tent doors, connecting all the tents together. Various flags bearing model titles fluttered on each tent. Red "August 1st" army emblems were affixed to the tent doors, flanked by couplets such as "Implement Determined Plans, Complete the Advance Mission." The soldiers collected various flowers, plants, and mosses from the mountains and grasslands, and moved white stones and pebbles. Each squad and platoon built many small gardens outside their tents. The soldiers hung up many signs saying "Soldiers' Paradise" on the barren, damp grasslands. They used green velvet-like moss to create slogans like "Build Tibet," "Long Live Chairman Mao," and "Defend World Peace, Oppose Aggressive War," and used white pebbles to build a wide "Kang and Tibetan People's Great Unity Square." Near the camp, they built neat roads and named them "Policy and Discipline Road" and "People and Horses Health Road," etc. Outside the headquarters tent, there were three-dimensional models of the Kangzang Plateau made by staff officers. These models used yellow earth to form mountains, blue stones to represent rivers, white stones to build cities, and thin red ropes to mark the routes already traversed.

As soon as it dawned, the soldiers began their exercises. In the afternoon, they began joyful activities in the squares and gardens they had built. They played collective games, and the propaganda team beat drums and performed the Yangko dance. Some learned Tibetan on the grass stage or wrote articles for the company newspaper.

The soldiers have become accustomed to eating meat, yak butter, and zanba from the plateau. After meals, they happily drank strong tea while making plans to earn merits.

Tibetan compatriots passing through the troop camp were often attracted by the soldiers' joyful life and stopped to watch. The soldiers would smile kindly at the Tibetan compatriots and shout "Alo" (the greeting used by Tibetan compatriots when they meet). Some even helped the Tibetan compatriots carrying firewood to the city by carrying it for a section of the road. Tibetan compatriots from nearby pastures often came to the camp to visit and chat. They always smiled and gave the soldiers a thumbs up when they met.

In the evening, each squad held discussions under oil lamps in their tents. At this time, looking down from above, the camp on the grassland was like a small town with thousands of lights. This joyful military camp life kept the soldiers full of energy for the advance.

### 生活在康藏高原上

　　生活在康藏高原上
    进军西藏的战士们在拔海三千公尺以上的康藏高原上创造出了愉快的军营生活。在雅礲江、金沙江、澜沧江的江边，都曾是战士们的宿营地。在那里的一片片绿色的帐篷，就是战士们在进军途中的温暖的家。他们不仅把这些帐篷改造得能够挡住高原上的狂风骤雨，而且还创造出美丽的宿营地。
    当战士们在江边搭帐设营的时候，战士们就在帐篷门前修筑了道路，所有帐篷都连接起来。每个帐篷上飘着各式各样的缀着模范称号的旗帜。帐篷门上缀起红色的“八一”军徽，门两旁贴着“执行决心计划，完成进军任务”之类的对联。战士们从山上，从草地里，采集了各种各样的花草和苔藓，搬来了白色的石块和小石子，每个班、排就在帐篷外面建设起了许许多多的小花园。战士们在荒凉潮湿的草原上挂起了许多“战士乐园”的牌子。他们用绿绒般的苔藓砌成了“建设西藏”、“毛主席万岁”、“保卫世界和平，反对侵略战争”的标语，又用白石子筑成宽大的“藏汉人民大团结广场”，在营地附近，修筑了整齐的道路，并把它们命名为“政策纪律路”、“人马健康路”等。在司令部的帐篷外面，有参谋人员作的康藏高原的立体模型。这些模型用黄土堆成山脉，蓝石摆成河流，白石修成城市，细红绳标志着已经走过的路线。
    天一亮，战士们就开始了演习。到下午，战士们便在自己修筑的广场上和花园里，开始了愉快的活动。他们玩着集体游戏，宣传队敲着锣鼓扭秧歌。有的在草台上学藏语或给连队报纸写稿。
    战士们已经习惯了吃高原上的肉食酥油和糌粑。饭后，他们便快乐地一面喝着浓茶，一面订出立功计划。
    经过部队营地的藏胞，常被战士们这种愉快的生活所吸引而停下来观看，战士们就向藏胞亲切地笑着喊：“阿喽”（藏胞们见面的招呼语），有的还替进城卖柴的藏胞背着送一段路。附近牧场的藏胞，也常到营地里参观谈天。他们一见面总是笑着向战士们伸出大拇指来。
    晚上，各班在帐内油灯下召开讨论会。这时，从高处望下来，草原上的营地，就像一个万家灯火的小城镇。这种愉快的军营生活使战士们保持着进军的充沛精力。
