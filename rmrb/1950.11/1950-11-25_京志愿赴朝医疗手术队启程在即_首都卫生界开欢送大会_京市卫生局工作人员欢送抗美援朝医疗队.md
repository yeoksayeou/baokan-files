　　The Beijing Volunteer Surgical Medical Team to Korea is Set to Depart
    Capital Health Community Holds Farewell Meeting
    Beijing Municipal Health Bureau Staff See Off Medical Team for Resisting America and Aiding Korea
    [Our Newspaper] The Beijing Volunteer Surgical Medical Team to Korea is about to depart. Yesterday (the 24th) at 6:00 PM, the capital's health community held a farewell meeting at Fu Jen Catholic University. Over a thousand people attended, including representatives from Peking University Medical School, Central People's Hospital, the Chinese Medical Association, the Chinese Medical Society, and comrades such as He Cheng and Fu Lianzhang. Amidst thunderous applause and military music, the seventy-seven surgical team members, led by Professor Chen Jingyun, arrived at the venue, greeted by enthusiastic cheers from the attendees. At the meeting, He Cheng and others pointed out in their speeches: Today, our surgical team is learning the great internationalist spirit of Dr. Bethune, going to the front lines in Korea to rescue our volunteer forces aiding Korea and the Korean People's Army. In the future, we will produce more Dr. Bethunes and Li Lanting. Professor Chen Jingyun, the leader of the surgical team, said: "We cannot sit idly by and watch the American imperialists continue to massacre the Chinese and Korean people. We must go to the battlefield to rescue those who are fighting for justice, so they can continue to fight one after another until victory. We must complete the glorious mission of the surgical team." The representative of the Beijing Medical Union said in his speech: "I represent more than 3,600 medical workers in Beijing to guarantee that we will redouble our efforts in the rear and prepare to welcome the triumphant return of the surgical team." Various units presented flowers and gifts to the surgical team.
    [Our Newspaper] The medical personnel of the Beijing Municipal Public Health Bureau and its affiliated hospitals and health centers have extremely high patriotic fervor for resisting America and aiding Korea. Currently, twenty-three doctors and nurses have voluntarily formed a medical team to resist America and aid Korea, which will soon depart for service on the Korean battlefield. On the afternoon of the 22nd of this month, the staff of the Beijing Municipal Health Bureau held a grand farewell meeting in the Health Education Hall of Zhongshan Park. The walls were covered with slogans such as "Learn from Dr. Bethune's Internationalist Spirit" and "Learn from the Medical Team Resisting America and Aiding Korea." More than 400 people attended the farewell. Comrade Hu Bichen, the leader of the medical team, said in his speech on behalf of all the team members: "We will serve the warriors on the Korean front with our greatest efforts, so that the wounded and sick comrades can recover their health as soon as possible and return to the front to eliminate the American and Syngman Rhee bandit gangs." Dr. Li Shuren said happily: "We will wholeheartedly serve the wounded and sick and strive for the final victory in resisting America and aiding Korea." Nurse representative Jin Zhaofen said: "This trip to the front line is a test for us. We must withstand this test, and we must strive for a victorious return and glorious admission into the Party." Many comrades who stayed behind spoke one after another: "We will definitely complete the work left by the medical team comrades. Go forward bravely! Victory will surely belong to us!"
