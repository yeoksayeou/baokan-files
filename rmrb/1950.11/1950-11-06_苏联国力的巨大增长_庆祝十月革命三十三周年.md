　　The Great Growth of Soviet National Power
    ——Celebrating the Thirty-Third Anniversary of the October Revolution
    November 7th this year marks the thirty-third anniversary of the great October Revolution. For thirty-three years, under the leadership of the Party of Lenin and Stalin, the Soviet people have completed the great feat of socialist construction and have raised the national strength of the Soviet Union to an unprecedentedly powerful level.
    The October Revolution eliminated the system of exploitation and implemented the social ownership of the means of production, which opened up unlimited prospects for the development of productive forces. First, socialist industry grew at an unparalleled speed. Since the implementation of the First Five-Year Plan in the Soviet Union in 1928, the former agricultural country was transformed into an industrial country in about thirteen years. From 1929 to 1949, over a period of twenty years, the Soviet Union's industrial production increased by nearly nine times, which is unimaginable in capitalist countries. During the same twenty years, U.S. industrial production increased by only 59 percent, and Britain by 42 percent. The rate of increase in Soviet industrial production was ten times faster than that of the United States.
    In agriculture, thanks to the large-scale operation of socialist collective farms and the widespread application of machinery, electricity, and science and technology, agricultural production has been rapidly improved. In 1928, the total grain output of the Soviet Union was 4.5 billion poods (1 pood equals 32.7 jin), which increased to 7.3 billion poods in 1940. By last year, the Soviet Union not only healed the wounds of war, but also increased grain production to 7.6 billion poods. Agricultural labor has been generally mechanized, and 85 to 90 percent of this year's cultivation work used tractors. The vast rural areas have been electrified. The Five-Year Plan stipulates that the electricity supplied to rural areas this year will reach 2,269,700 kilowatts, which is more than 1,133 times the electricity used in rural areas in 1913 before the October Revolution.
    The enormous potential of socialist countries has been brilliantly demonstrated in the Soviet Union's two anti-aggression wars in its history. From 1918 to 1920, the newborn Soviet state defeated the joint offensive of fourteen countries and domestic reactionaries under difficult conditions. In the Great Patriotic War against German fascism from 1941 to 1945, the power exerted by the Soviet Union shocked the world. During the war, the territory of the Soviet Union occupied by the Hitler bandit gang accounted for 45 percent of the total population of the Soviet Union and 47 percent of the sown area. Sixty-six percent of the industry in the occupied and combat areas was at a standstill. The Soviet army resisted 207 divisions of the well-equipped fascist army on the battlefield. At the most frenzied time of the enemy's offensive, the Soviet people quickly established a wartime industrial base in the east with tenacious efforts, reorganized the national economy to the wartime track, and concentrated all material forces to conduct the war victoriously. After passing the lowest point of production in 1941, industrial production increased by 50 percent throughout 1942, and by another 17 percent in 1943 compared with 1942. Fuel increased from 92 million tons at the lowest point in 1942 to 139 million tons in 1944, while the main mining areas fell into the hands of the enemy. With 60 percent of the ferrous metal smelting capacity at a standstill, the production of milled iron in the eastern region increased by 46 percent in 1944 compared with 1940, steel increased by 44 percent, and rolled metal increased by 42 percent. In the second year of the war, aircraft production had increased by 3.3 times, tanks by 2 times, artillery by 1.8 times, and mortars by nearly 4 times. By 1943, Soviet industry had supplied the front with sufficient ammunition, enabling the soldiers on the front line to drop half a ton of steel explosives on the head of each enemy. During the last three years of the war, the military industry produced an average of 40,000 aircraft, 30,000 tanks, self-propelled guns, and armored vehicles, 120,000 artillery pieces, 450,000 machine guns, 3 million rifles, and 2 million automatic rifles each year. This enabled the Soviet army to successfully launch a counter-offensive and, in the Battle of Berlin, to invest 41,000 artillery pieces and mortars, 8,400 aircraft, and more than 6,300 new heavy tanks, and destroy the fascist nest in one fell swoop. By the end of the Patriotic War, the Soviet army had divisions four times larger than usual, five times as many artillery pieces, fifteen times as many tanks, and five times as many aircraft. The Soviet army eliminated more than 10 million German fascist troops on the battlefield. The people in the rear supported the war with selfless labor, which can be seen from one thing: the proportion of women among Soviet tractor drivers increased from 4 percent in 1940 to 45 percent in 1942, female combine drivers increased from 6 percent to 43 percent, female agricultural truck drivers increased from 5 percent to 36 percent, and female tractor team leaders increased from 1 percent to 10 percent. With a sharp reduction in cultivated area, collective farmers supplied the country with more than 4.26 billion poods of grain from 1941 to 1944, ensuring an uninterrupted supply of food for the military and civilians.
    The difficulties encountered by the Soviet people in the post-war reconstruction work were no less than those during the war. The direct losses caused by the enemy's destruction and plunder in the recovered areas were worth a total of 128 billion U.S. dollars. The losses suffered by the national economy due to military expenditures and production stoppages were worth a total of 357 billion U.S. dollars. In order to restore to the pre-war level, the industrial output in the recovered areas needed to be increased by five and a half times compared with 1944, coal needed to be increased by four times, electricity by more than six times, and steelmaking by more than nine times. Among agricultural products, grain needed to be increased by 70 percent, hemp by 3.3 times, and sugar beet by more than four times. Among livestock, cattle needed to be increased by more than one and a half times, and horses by 2.6 times. However, the Soviet people have once again achieved incomparably brilliant achievements in the work of reviving and prospering the motherland. By the fourth quarter of 1949, the total industrial output of the recovered areas had reached 106 percent of the 1940 level, and 90 percent of the houses in the towns and cities had been restored. Throughout the Soviet Union, 5,200 large industrial enterprises were restored and rebuilt in the first four years of the implementation of the post-war Five-Year Plan. In 1949, the total industrial output exceeded the 1940 level by 41 percent. In the fourth quarter of this year, the average monthly industrial output had exceeded the level stipulated by the Five-Year Plan for 1950. In the first three quarters of this year, the total industrial output increased by another 22 percent compared with the same period last year.
    Due to the enormous surge in Soviet national power, the Soviet people are victoriously carrying out the work of conquering nature. In 1948, the Soviet Union began to implement the famous Stalin plan for transforming nature. This plan is to plant 5.7 million hectares of forest belts in the steppe area of the European part of the Soviet Union within fifteen years and build a large number of reservoirs. These forests will block dry winds, permanently eliminate drought, and ensure a bumper harvest every year for the vast farmland. Since the implementation of the plan for two years, 1 million hectares of planting work have been completed, and more than 10,000 reservoirs have been built. On the eve of the imminent victorious completion of the Five-Year Plan, the Soviet Council of Ministers made successive decisions in September this year to build the world's largest Kuibyshev and Stalingrad hydropower stations on the Volga River in the next five or six years, dig the world's longest canal in Turkmenistan in modern times, build the Kakhovka Hydropower Station on the Dnieper River, and dig two interconnected South Ukrainian and North Crimean canals in Ukraine. The total power generation capacity of the newly built hydropower stations (including hydropower stations along the canal) reaches 4.25 million kilowatts, which is equivalent to eight times the power generation capacity of the world-famous Soviet Dnieper Hydropower Station. The water supply system of the Turkmen Canal and various hydropower stations will irrigate 25 million hectares of land, which is more than two and a half times the total irrigated area of the United States. The Turkmen Canal is the longest canal in the world today, with a total length of 1,100 kilometers. In the canal area, 1,200 kilometers of water supply canals will also be dug, and 1,000 kilometers of water pipes will be laid. In six or seven years, 7 million hectares of desert will be irrigated, which is approximately equivalent to the desert land irrigated by the United States in 100 years.
    Over the past thirty-three years, Soviet science has made great achievements. The valuable crop varieties cultivated by agronomist Lysenko have made Soviet agriculture increasingly prosperous; the engineers who built the Stalingrad Hydropower Station have created an engineering design that uses the flow of water flowing through the plains to generate electricity; biologist Lepeshinskaya has explored the secrets of the origin of life; Soviet scientists have long mastered the secrets of atomic energy and are studying its use in production and construction, opening up unlimited prospects for human happiness.
    Over the past thirty-three years, the labor productivity of the Soviet Union has been rapidly improved. In 1937, labor productivity had been increased to more than four and a half times the level of 1913. The post-war Five-Year Plan stipulates that labor productivity will exceed the 1940 level by 36 percent this year. The Stakhanov movement, which is a symbol of improving labor productivity, has become more significantly collective in nature in the post-war years. Now there are millions of Stakhanov workers, tens of thousands of Stakhanov work teams and shock brigades, and a large number of factories have become "collective Stakhanov enterprises" because they have collectively improved production. Such a vast number of new types of laborers with advanced technical levels are the great force driving the rapid growth of the Soviet economy.
    The production enthusiasm of the Soviet working people has reached an unprecedented peak. Workers and technicians put forward 450,000 inventions and rationalization proposals last year, and 90 percent of the working people have participated in the production competition.
    The living standards of the Soviet people have been greatly improved. At the end of last year, workers' income increased by 24 percent compared with 1940, and farmers' income increased by more than 30 percent. The three price reductions from 1947 to 1950 have benefited the people by at least 267 billion rubles.
    There are 1,132,000 students in Soviet higher education institutions, including correspondence students. There are more than 37 million students in schools at all levels, technical schools, and other specialized educational institutions. The number of experts graduating from schools last year increased by 68 percent compared with 1940. The Soviet intellectuals are firmly united around the Soviet government and the Bolshevik Party and have dedicated all their wisdom to the prosperity and strength of the Soviet state.
    On the thirty-third anniversary of the great October Revolution, people all over the world are cheering for the strength and prosperity of the Soviet Union. Because the strength and prosperity of the Soviet Union is the most powerful guarantee that the peace-loving people of the world will inevitably defeat the imperialist aggressors.

　　苏联国力的巨大增长
    ——庆祝十月革命三十三周年
    今年十一月七日是伟大十月革命的三十三周年纪念日。三十三年来，苏联人民在列宁——斯大林的党的领导下，完成了社会主义建设的丰功伟业，已把苏联的国力提高到空前强大的地步。
    十月革命消灭了剥削制度，实行了生产资料的社会公有，这就给生产力打开了无限发展的前途。首先是社会主义工业以无比的速度壮大起来。从一九二八年苏联实行第一届五年计划以后，在十三年左右的时间内就把过去的农业国变成了工业国。从一九二九到一九四九年的二十年间，苏联工业生产量增加了将及九倍，这在资本主义国家是不能想像的。在同样的二十年中间，美国工业生产不过增加了百分之五十九，英国增加了百分之四十二。苏联工业生产的增加速度比美国要快十倍。
    在农业方面，由于社会主义集体农庄的大规模经营方式，和机械、电力与科学技术的广泛应用，已使农业生产迅速提高。一九二八年苏联谷物总产量为四十五亿普特（一普特合三十二点七市斤），一九四○年增至七十三亿普特。到了去年，苏联不但治愈了战争的创伤，并且提高谷物产量到七十六亿普特。农业劳动已普遍机械化，今年的耕耘工作有百分之八十五到九十使用了拖拉机。广大农村已经电气化了。五年计划规定：供应农村的电力在今年要达到二百二十六万九千七百千瓦，比十月革命前一九一三年农村中使用的电力增加到一千一百三十三倍以上。
    社会主义国家的巨大潜力，在苏联历史上两次反侵略的战争中曾经有过极为辉煌的表现。一九一八年至一九二○年间，新生的苏维埃国家曾经在艰苦的条件下击败十四个国家和国内反动派的联合进攻。在一九四一年到一九四五年反对德国法西斯的伟大爱国战争中，苏联发挥的力量曾经震动了全世界。战争期间希特勒匪帮所侵占的苏联的领土，占苏联人口总数的百分之四十五，占播种面积的百分之四十七。沦陷区和作战区域工业陷于停顿者占全部工业的百分之六十六。苏联军队在战场上抗御了优势装备的法西斯军队二百零七个师团。在敌人进攻得最疯狂的时候，苏联人民在东部以顽强的努力迅速建立了战时工业基础，把国民经济改组到战时轨道上，集中一切物质力量胜利地进行了战争。在度过了一九四一年的生产最低点后，一九四二年全年内工业生产就增加了百分之五十，一九四三年又比一九四二年增加了百分之十七。燃料在主要矿区沦于敌手的情况下，由一九四二年最低点的九千二百万吨增长到一九四四年的一亿三千九百万吨。在百分之六十的黑色金属冶炼能力陷于停顿的情况下，东部地区的铣铁产量到一九四四年比一九四○年增加了百分之四十六，钢增加了百分之四十四，辗金属增加了百分之四十二。在战争的第二年，飞机生产便已增加到三点三倍，坦克二倍，大炮一点八倍，迫击炮将及四倍。到一九四三年，苏联工业已以足够的弹药供应了前方，使第一线的士兵能够向每个敌寇头上投下半吨的钢铁炸药。在战争的后三年期间，军用工业每年平均生产四万架飞机，三万辆坦克、自动推进炮和装甲汽车，十二万尊大炮，四十五万架机枪，三百万支步枪和二百万支自动枪。这就使苏联军队得以胜利地进入反攻，并在攻克柏林的战役中，投入了四万一千尊大炮和迫击炮、八千四百架飞机和六千三百多辆新式重坦克，一举摧毁了法西斯的巢穴。到爱国战争终结之时，苏军已拥有比平时多至四倍的师团，五倍的大炮，十五倍的坦克，和五倍的飞机。苏军在战场上消灭了法西斯德军一千万人以上。后方人民以忘我的劳动支援战争，可以从一件事看出来：苏联拖拉机驾驶员中妇女所占的比例从一九四○年的百分之四增加到一九四二年的百分之四十五，联合机女驾驶员从百分之六增加到百分之四十三，农业汽车女司机从百分之五增加到百分之三十六，拖拉机女队长从百分之一增加到百分之十。在耕地面积锐减的情况下，集体农民从一九四一年到一九四四年供给了国家四十二亿六千余万普特的粮食，保证了军民食粮的供应无缺。
    苏联人民在战后的恢复建设工作中遇到的困难并不亚于战争时期。在收复区内，由于敌寇的破坏和劫掠而造成的直接损失，共值一千二百八十亿美元。国民经济因军事费用和生产停顿而受到的损失，共值三千五百七十亿美元。为恢复到战前的水平，收复区的工业产量需要比一九四四年提高到五倍半，煤要提高到四倍，电力六倍以上，炼钢九倍以上。农产品中谷物要提高百分之七十，麻三点三倍，甜菜四倍以上。牲畜中牛要增殖一倍半以上，马匹二点六倍。但是苏联人民在复兴与繁荣祖国的工作中又获得了无比辉煌的成就。到一九四九年第四季，收复区的工业总产量已达一九四○年水平的百分之一百零六，城镇中百分之九十的房舍已告恢复。在全苏境内，在执行战后五年计划的前四年前，恢复和重建的大工业企业达到五千二百座。一九四九年工业生产总量超过一九四○年水平的百分之四十一，这一年的第四季，工业每月平均产量已超过了五年计划为一九五○年规定的水平。今年的头三季，工业总产量又较去年同期增加了百分之二十二。
    由于苏联国力的巨大高涨，苏联人民正胜利地进行着征服自然的工作。一九四八年苏联开始执行著名的斯大林改造自然的计划，这一计划是要在苏联欧洲部分的草原地带，在十五年内种植五百七十万公顷的森林带，并建造大量蓄水池。这些森林将要挡住干风，永远消除旱灾，使广大农田保证年年丰收。计划执行两年以来，已经完成了一百万公顷的种植工作，建筑了一万个以上的蓄水池。在五年计划即将胜利完成的前夕，苏联部长会议又于今年九月间接连作出决定，要在今后的五、六年内，在伏尔加河上兴建世界上最大的古比雪夫与斯大林格勒水力发电站，在土库曼开凿当代世界上最长的大运河，在第聂伯河上兴建卡霍夫卡水电站，在乌克兰开凿两相通连的南乌克兰与北克里米亚运河。新建的水电站（包括运河沿线的水电站）发电总能力达到四百二十五万千瓦，相当于举世闻名的苏联第聂伯河水电站发电能力的八倍。土库曼运河与各水电站的供水系统，将要灌溉二千五百万公顷的土地，这个数字超过了美国全部灌溉面积的两倍半。土库曼运河是当代世界上最长的运河，全长达一千一百公里。在运河地区还要开凿一千二百公里的供水渠，敷设一千公里的水管，要在六、七年内灌溉七百万公顷的沙漠，约相当于美国在一百年内灌溉的沙漠土地。
    三十三年来，苏联科学已获得伟大成就。农学家李森科培育的珍贵的农作物品种，使苏联农业日趋繁荣；兴建斯大林格勒水电站的工程师，已创造了利用流经平原的水流来发电的工程设计；生物学家勒柏辛斯卡娅已探究了生物起源的秘密；苏联科学家早就掌握了原子能的秘密，正在研究将其使用于生产建设，为人类打开无限幸福的远景。
    三十三年来，苏联的劳动生产率已经迅速提高。一九三七年劳动生产率已提高为一九一三年的水平的四倍半以上，战后五年计划规定今年劳动生产率要再超过一九四○年水平的百分之三十六。作为提高劳动生产率的标志的斯塔哈诺夫运动，在战后年代更具有了显著的集体的性质。现在苏联已有成百万的斯塔哈诺夫工作者，成万的斯塔哈诺夫工作班和突击队，大批的工厂已因集体提高了生产而成为“集体斯塔哈诺夫企业”。这样浩大的具有先进技术水平的新型劳动者，便是推动苏联经济迅速增长的巨大力量。
    苏联劳动人民的生产热情，已经达到了空前的高峰。工人和技术人员在去年一年内提出的发明与合理化建议达四十五万件，劳动人民已有百分之九十参加了生产竞赛。
    苏联人民的生活水平已经大大提高了。去年年底工人收入较一九四○年增加了百分之二十四，农民收入增加了百分之三十强。一九四七年到一九五○年的三次减低物价，使人民至少获益二千六百七十亿卢布。
    苏联的高等教育机关，包括函授学生在内，有一百十三万二千人。各级学校，技术学校和其他专门教育机关的学生在三千七百万人以上。去年由学校毕业的专家比一九四○年又增加了百分之六十八。苏联知识分子巩固地团结在苏联政府与布尔什维克党的周围，为苏维埃国家的繁荣强大献出了全部智慧。
    在伟大十月革命的三十三周年，全世界人民都在为苏联的强大与繁荣而欢呼。因为苏联的强大与繁荣，便是全世界和平人民必然战胜帝国主义侵略者的最有力的保障。
