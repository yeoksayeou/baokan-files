　　Eliminating Illusions About Kidd

     ——I Watched "Voice of America"
    After watching the "Voice of America," I thought about how some people have deep or shallow illusions about the false benevolence, the pretended democracy of American society, and the American way of life. This kind of illusion is unacceptable, harmful, and dangerous. If this illusion is not eradicated, they will inevitably suffer the oppression and murder of the American reactionary ruling class, just like Captain Kidd before he was awakened.

    Originally, an illusion, once solidified in a person's mind, has its social roots. Although Captain Kidd was in the anti-fascist allied forces, he had a high sense of justice and became a progressive officer who sympathized with the Soviet Union and hated fascism, taking pride in receiving a Soviet medal. However, because he grew up in an American family, received an American education, and lived an American life, his illusions took root in his blood, and it was difficult to eradicate them all at once without a serious reality check.

    For those who have illusions about the United States, although the source of their thinking is different from that of Captain Kidd, the harm they cause is the same. They probably do not understand the true situation in the United States due to long-term feudal rule and the deception of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. They only hear the reactionary propaganda, which makes them have a misconception about the United States. This misconception leads to illusions or vacillation between revolution and reaction, unable to see the lives of the working people, unable to see the power of the revolution, unable to see through the essence of imperialism, and thus producing such illusions. As the revolution progresses, with the Chinese people's great anti-Japanese and anti-Chiang struggle, their thinking will improve and progress. They will have a further understanding of the American imperialists' conspiracy and actual actions to aid the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang with money and weapons, expand the civil war, and invade China, and they will also have a real feeling, just as Captain Kidd experienced, and then the illusion begins to shake.

    The shaking of the illusion does not mean complete elimination, because this is a matter of thought. Since it is a matter of thought, it will not be dispelled with one slap. They may still say "The moon in America is brighter than in China," "American goods are better than Chinese goods," "American film technology is stronger than China's," "American atomic bombs are more powerful than anything else," "Americans also talk about democracy," etc. If this thing hidden in the root of thought is not eradicated, it will hinder the better development of the Resist America, Aid Korea work.

    Captain Kidd's illusion is naturally not that serious. He is the American type—an American righteous soldier (intellectual) produced in that specific environment. Therefore, although he has the courage to fight the American reactionary Wheeler, the determination to maintain justice, and the spirit of pursuing truth, he still has the last illusions about American society, the American president, democracy, and law. It was not until he was unreasonably dismissed from his military post, insulted, and even wounded by gunfire, that his illusions began to shatter. His transformation was naturally due to his comrade-in-arms, the Communist McDonald. From their time together on the battlefield to their encounter in their hometown, McDonald repeatedly gave profound explanations and warnings about what Kidd was fantasizing about. The most clever thing was that when McDonald talked to Kidd, he lit a match, using it as a metaphor, saying, "This is the president's law," and then blew out the match with a "poof," explaining, "The bosses on Wall Street don't want this." On the same day, an old policeman came to tell Kidd that the reactionary government had judged him to be a "Red" and a "traitor to America" and was about to arrest him. In this way, under the light of truth and the blow of reality, the illusion that existed deep in his mind was truly eradicated, and he resolutely moved towards revolution.

    On the stage of "Voice of America," we clearly saw the society under the rule of American bandits, the dirty American way of life, the wrongdoing of a few rulers, the miserable lives of the working people, and the growth of the will to resist. We saw the arduous struggle of the Communists, both openly and secretly, and the entire process and image of Captain Kidd's transformation. Therefore, the staging of "Voice of America," especially today when the Resist America, Aid Korea work is being carried out, and when educating the broad audience and the people should hate, despise, and disdain American imperialism, has a more profound educational significance. Finally, I want to solemnly say that we must completely eradicate all illusions like Captain Kidd's, reverse his thinking, and make him move towards the torrent of resisting America and aiding Korea to complete the Chinese revolutionary struggle.

### 消灭基德的幻想——我看了《美国之音》

　　消灭基德的幻想
     ——我看了《美国之音》
    我看了美国之音，想到了有人对于美国的假仁假义、伪装民主的现实社会，以及美国式的生活，存在着或深或浅的幻想。这种幻想是要不得的，是有害的，是危险的。如果这种幻想不铲除，那就一定像没有觉悟之前的基德上尉一样，遭受到美国反动统治阶级的压迫与谋杀。
    本来一种幻想，在人的思想里凝成，是有它的社会根源的。基德上尉虽说在反法西斯同盟军中，由于他有高度的正义感，成为一个同情苏联，仇恨法西斯的进步军官，并以获得苏联奖章为荣耀。但是，由于他生长在美国的家庭里，受过美国式的教育，度过美国式的生活，他的幻想也就在他血液里生了根，如果不遇到严重的现实打击，就很难一下铲除掉。
    对于美国存在着幻想的人，他的思想根源虽说与基德上尉不同，但他的危害是一致的。他大概是在长期的封建统治，以及蒋匪帮的愚弄下对于美国真实情况并不了解，单单听到反动派的愚弄宣传，使他对于美国的认识有了错觉，就在这错觉上产生了幻想或者是游离于革命与反动之间，看不到劳动人民的生活，看不到革命的力量，看不透帝国主义的本质，因而产生了这样的幻想，随着革命的进展，中国人民伟大的抗日反蒋斗争，他的思想会有提高，会有进步，对于美国帝国主义以金钱武器援助蒋匪帮，扩大内战，侵略中国的阴谋和实际行动，有了进一步的认识，也有了真切的感受，正如基德上尉所经历的一样，于是幻想开始动摇了。
    幻想的动摇，并不等于彻底的消灭，因为这是一个思想问题，既是一个思想问题，就不会一巴掌拍散。他可能还会说“美国的月亮比中国亮”，“美国的货物比中国好”，“美国的电影技术比中国强”，“美国的原子弹比什么都厉害”，“美国人也是讲民主的吧”等等，这种潜藏在思想根源里的东西，如果不铲除，他就会妨碍抗美援朝工作的更好开展。
    基德上尉的幻想自然没有这样严重，他是美国型的，——是美国正义军人（知识分子）在那特定环境里产生的。因此，他虽说有和美国反动派惠勒斗争的勇气，有维护正义的决心，有追求真理的精神；同时，对美国的现实社会，对美国的总统、民主、法律，还存在着最后的幻想。等到他被无缘无故的撤消军职，受到侮辱，以致受到枪伤之后，他的幻想才开始破灭了。他的获得转变，自然还要归功于他的战友共产党员麦唐纳，从战地的相处，到家乡的相遇，多少次对于基德所幻想的东西，加以深刻的解说与警告，最巧妙的是麦唐纳和基德谈话的时候燃起了一根火柴，他打着比方说“这就是总统法律”，紧接着扑的一声吹灭了火柴，解释说“华尔街的老板们是不要这个的”。就在当天，一个老警察来告诉基德，反动政府判定他是“红党”，是“美国的叛徒”，马上要逮捕他，这样，在真理的光耀与现实的打击下，存在于他思想深处的幻想，才真正的铲除了，毅然决心地走向了革命。
    在美国之音上演的舞台上，我们清楚地看到了美国强盗统治下的社会，看到了肮脏的美国式的生活，看到了少数统治者的为非作恶，看到了劳动人民的困苦生活，与反抗意志的生长，看到了共产党员公开和秘密的坚苦斗争，看到了基德上尉转变的整个过程与形象。因此，美国之音的上演特别在抗美援朝工作开展的今天，在教育广大观众和人民应该仇视、鄙视、蔑视美帝国主义的今天，更有它深刻的教育意义。最后，我要郑重的说一声，必须彻底铲除像基德上尉的一切幻想，扭转他的思想，使他走向抗美援朝完成中国革命斗争的洪流。
