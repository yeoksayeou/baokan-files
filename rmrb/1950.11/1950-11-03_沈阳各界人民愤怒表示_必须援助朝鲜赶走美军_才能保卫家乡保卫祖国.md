Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 1st. In recent days, the people of Shenyang from all walks of life have been extremely angry about the increasingly serious threat to our country's security caused by the US's expanding war of aggression against Korea. They have expressed their views that it is necessary to support the Korean people with various practical actions to drive out the American invading troops in order to safeguard the independence of the motherland and world peace.

　　At a symposium of viewers visiting the exhibition of pictures commemorating the fifth anniversary of the liberation of Korea, speakers stated that during the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation, the people of Northeast China and the people of Korea fought side by side. The people of the two countries are like brothers with hearts linked. Today, the Korean people are suffering serious setbacks under the barbaric aggression of US imperialism. We should support them morally and responsibly.

　　Song Wenxuan, an advanced producer at the Fourth Pharmaceutical Factory, said, "A distant relative is not as good as a close neighbor. Today, nothing concerns us more than the struggle of the Korean people. Our responsibility is to step up production and produce more medicines to support the Korean People's Army."

　　Bao Youcai, a farmer from Xiwuqi Village in the fifth district of the suburbs of the city, quoted an old saying: "Build a dam before the water comes." He believes that to protect our fields, houses, and beautiful life, we must use all our strength to help the Korean people drive the American bandit army into the Eastern Ocean.

　　Wang Weichen, a citizen in his sixties who experienced the "September 18th Incident," recalled the situation at the time, saying, "The Japanese devils invaded the Northeast from Korea back then. Now the American bandits want to follow this old path again. Everyone should be vigilant. Don't wait for them to attack before preparing. The best way is to actively assist the Korean people and completely eliminate the American invading troops."

　　If we don't help the Korean people kill the murderous devils,
　　All mothers cannot feel at ease.

　　Li Shuqing, a housewife with two children, said: The American devils are devils who specialize in killing people. If we don't help the Korean people kill this devil, all mothers cannot feel at ease.

　　The Cultural Center of Heping District is crowded with workers and students every evening. They read newspapers and discuss the Korean war situation. Their unanimous opinion is that our next-door neighbor is on fire, and we must not sit idly by. We must quickly help the Korean people put out the American flame of aggression. Wang Daoxian, a pedicab driver who rarely reads newspapers, came specifically to inquire about Korean news. He said: "My hometown is in Andong, and I still have my old mother and three children at home. American planes strafed and bombed my hometown, and I can't be quiet for a moment. We can only feel at ease if we help the Korean people eliminate the American devils."

　　Gong Tianmin, vice chairman of the Shenyang YMCA, told reporters: "Everyone knows the inhumane acts caused by US imperialism's aggression against Korea. This is completely contrary to the Christian doctrine of universal love. Therefore, from a humanitarian standpoint, the towering crimes of American aggression should be punished by the righteous people."

　　沈阳各界人民愤怒表示
    必须援助朝鲜赶走美军
    才能保卫家乡保卫祖国
    【新华社沈阳一日电】连日来沈阳各界人民对美国扩大侵朝战争日益严重地威胁我国安全，极为愤怒，纷纷表示必须以各种实际行动来支援朝鲜人民赶走美国侵略军队，才能保障祖国的独立和世界的和平。
    在参观朝鲜解放五周年图片展览的观众座谈会上，发言者纷纷表示：在抗日战争和解放战争中，东北人民和朝鲜人民并肩战斗，两国人民正如手足连心的亲兄弟，今天朝鲜人民在美帝国主义的野蛮侵略下受到严重挫折，我们从道义上和责任上都应该支援他们。
    第四化学制药厂的先进生产者宋文选说：“远亲不如近邻，在今天再没有比朝鲜人民的斗争使我们更为关心，我们的责任就是加紧生产，多造药品，来支援朝鲜人民军。”
    市郊五区西五旗村农民包有财引用了一句古话——“不等水来先叠坝”，他认为要想保住咱们的田地房屋和美好的生活，只有拿出一切力量帮助朝鲜人民把美国强盗军队赶到东洋大海里去。
    曾经经历过“九一八”事变的六十多岁的市民王伟臣回忆起当时的情形说：“当年日本鬼子侵占东北就是从朝鲜打进来的，现在美国强盗又想走这一条老路，大家应该好好警惕，不要等他打来就要先防备，最好的办法是积极援助朝鲜人民，彻底消灭美国的侵略军队。”
    不帮助朝鲜人民打死杀人魔鬼
    所有做母亲的人都不能安心
    两个孩子的母亲家庭妇女李淑清说：美国鬼子就是专门杀人的魔鬼，不帮助朝鲜人民把这个魔鬼打死，所有做母亲的人都不能安心。
    和平区文化馆每日的傍晚挤满了工人和学生，他们一面翻阅报纸，一面谈论朝鲜战局。他们一致的意见是现在咱们的隔壁邻居失火，咱们绝不能坐视不救，要赶紧帮助朝鲜人民扑灭美国的侵略火焰。一位从来不大看报纸的三轮车工人王道贤特地赶来讯问朝鲜消息，他说：“我的老家在安东，我还有老母和三个小孩在家里，美国飞机扫射轰炸了我的家乡，我时刻都不能安静。我们只有帮助朝鲜人民消灭了美国鬼子才能使我安心。”
    沈阳市基督教青年会副理事长巩天民对记者说：“人人都知道美帝国主义侵略朝鲜所造成的极不人道的行为，这与基督教的博爱宗旨完全违背，因此，从人道立场上说，美国的滔天侵略罪行，应该受到正义人民的惩罚。”
