Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 3rd: Recently, American aircraft have continuously violated our Northeast airspace, indiscriminately strafing and bombing. The Shenyang Municipal Authorities, in order to protect the lives and safety of the local people, have actively carried out air defense facilities and excavated air raid shelters in the city. At 1:25 PM on October 30th, the Northeast Public Security Guard Regiment of Shenyang City sent four soldiers to dig an air raid shelter in the yard of the residence of Stevenson (former British Consul in Shenyang), located at No. 25, Erwei Road. However, when the soldiers began digging the trench, the British national Stevenson not only did not cooperate in the excavation but angrily jumped in front of soldier Xiao Hancai and used violence to prevent him from digging. The next day, the soldiers of our Public Security Bureau went to the British national's residence again to explain the great significance of the matter, but the national still refused to obey orders and even used a shovel to throw the excavated soil on the soldiers. The soldiers of our Public Security Guard Regiment, considering that the national was unreasonable and barbaric, immediately reported the details to the Shenyang Municipal People's Government. The Shenyang Municipal People's Government, considering that the British national had repeatedly violated the laws of our People's Government, not only did not assist the municipal authorities in completing air defense work but also obstructed our public security forces from carrying out air defense missions and insulted our air defense personnel, making it difficult to tolerate such a lawless foreigner's residence, immediately ordered Stevenson to leave the country within a prescribed time limit according to law. The British national has now left Shenyang at 6:00 PM on November 3rd.

　　英侨史蒂文顿不守法令
    侮辱我沈阳防空人员
    我已依法令其离沈出境
    【新华社沈阳三日电】最近美机不断侵犯我东北领空，滥行扫射轰炸。我沈阳市当局为保障当地人民生命安全起见，曾积极进行对空防御设施，并在市内挖掘空防掩体。十月三十日下午一时二十五分，我沈市东北公安警卫团曾派战士四人至二纬路二十五号英侨史蒂文顿（前英国驻沈阳领事）住宅院内挖掘空防掩体。但当战士动工挖壕时，该英侨史蒂文顿不但不协力挖掘，反而怒气冲冲跳至战士萧汉财面前用暴力阻其挖掘。翌日，我公安局战士再往该英侨住所，晓以大义，该侨仍不听命，甚至用铁锹将已挖出之土向战士身上抛去。我公安警卫团战士当以该侨蛮横不可理喻，即将详情报告沈阳市人民政府。沈市人民政府以该英侨一再违抗我人民政府法令，不但不协助市政当局完成空防工作，且阻挠我公安部队执行空防任务，侮辱我空防人员，似此不守法令外侨，实难容其居留，因即依法限期勒令史蒂文顿出境。现该英侨已于十一月三日下午六时离沈。
