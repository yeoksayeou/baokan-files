Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, November 4th: The Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau recently cracked an anti-revolutionary special agent organization, the bandit "National Defense Ministry Youth Salvation Corps Anti-Communist Pioneer Headquarters" (code-named "3811 Unit"), which was lurking in the city and specializing in creating rumors, distributing reactionary leaflets, collecting intelligence, and carrying out various sabotage activities. Over eighty ringleaders and accomplices, including principal offenders Li Guoliang and Zhou Xian, were arrested, and all evidence of their crimes was seized.

The main culprits, Li Guoliang and Zhou Xian, were both remnants of the former Chiang bandit Jingguo faction's special agent organization, the "Greater Shanghai Youth Service Headquarters." In March of this year, bandit Li and others secretly organized the "National Defense Ministry Youth Salvation Corps Anti-Communist Pioneer Headquarters," code-named "3811" unit, recruiting dispersed bandit soldiers and enticing some backward workers and peddlers to participate. They specialized in creating rumors, collecting intelligence on our factories and enterprises, PLA troop locations, and police post distribution, and carrying out sabotage. In order to expand their conspiratorial activities, the bandit special agent organization also absorbed Zhu Qilin, Dai Senming, Xu Guanguan, Wang Qingyun and other special agent elements from the former bandit "Worker Protection Team" of the Shanghai Wire Factory, appointing them as "brigade commanders" and tasking them with creating and spreading rumors in the factories, using pretexts to sow discord within the working class; and plotting to blow up machines and set fire to warehouses. Before National Day, the special agent organization printed a large number of reactionary leaflets, preparing to distribute them during the National Day parade, and deployed special agent elements to lurk in factories, waiting for an opportunity to blow up machines. After verification by our Municipal Public Security Bureau, the entire special agent organization was cracked down on September 29th. The case's bandit criminals have been thoroughly interrogated by the Municipal Public Security Bureau. According to the principle of "combining suppression with leniency," more than ten coerced followers, such as Wu Yongshen and Xue Azhen, have been granted bail and placed under supervision. The principal offenders, Li Guoliang and Zhou Xian, and the key criminals, Zhu Qilin and Dai Senming, have been transferred to the Municipal People's Court for severe punishment.
