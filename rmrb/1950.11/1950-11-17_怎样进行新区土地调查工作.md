How to Conduct Land Survey Work in New Areas
    Yi Zhi

    (I)
    In new areas, the number of land acres is extremely inaccurate, with a large amount of concealed land. According to preliminary materials from the autumn grain collection last year, concealed land generally reached 30% in Hunan, 25% in Zhejiang, 30% to 40% in Hubei, 30% to 50% in Guangdong, over 50% in typical materials from Fujian, and around 40% in typical materials from Shaanxi. Land concealment was mainly done by landlords (including clan ancestral halls, temples, and other group landlords). According to a survey in Limao Township, Neijiang County, Southern Sichuan, landlords accounted for 84.6% of the 10,121.2 mu of concealed land found in the township. In Renshou County, three landlords in Sanbao, Jia, concealed 72% of the land in the entire Bao. The second group was rich peasants. According to statistics from three counties and three villages in the Ningbo Special District, Zhejiang, landlords concealed 35.3% of their total land, rich peasants 22.5%, middle peasants 14.01%, and poor peasants 10.5%.

    Article 3 of the "Provisional Regulations on Agricultural Tax in Newly Liberated Areas" stipulates: "All land with agricultural income shall be subject to agricultural tax by the income earner, unless otherwise provided in these regulations." Article 11 of the "Land Reform Law of the People's Republic of China" stipulates: "Distribution of land... shall be based on the original cultivation, according to the quantity and quality of the land and its distance... and uniformly distributed according to the population." Therefore, verifying the amount of cultivated land in rural areas not only lays the foundation for implementing the agricultural tax system in new areas, but also provides good conditions for land reform.

    (II)
    In the past, many methods were adopted for surveying land in new areas, but the main ones were the following four:

    (1) Completely disregarding old materials from the Kuomintang era and redoing "household registration" and "self-reporting and public discussion."

    (2) Universal measurement.

    (3) "Task Contracting." First, assign the task to the village, and then announce to the masses: "The task is contracted, and no additional burden will be added for revealing concealed land." This was intended to encourage the masses to expose concealed land.

    (4) Reforming old materials from the Kuomintang era and mobilizing the masses to expose concealed land.

    Experience has proven that methods (1) and (2) were unsuccessful. Method (3) exposed a lot of concealed land, but had many shortcomings. Method (4) was relatively successful.

    Why did methods (1) and (2) fail? Because the first method was the survey method of old areas and was not suitable for the specific conditions of new areas. The second method neglected to mobilize the masses and only focused on technical aspects. In fact, any survey work that neglects to mobilize the masses cannot obtain good results, and the choice of method is closely related to the level of awareness and organization of the masses. The level of awareness and organization of peasants in new areas is not as high as in old areas. They do not clearly distinguish the advantages and disadvantages of concealing land from the Kuomintang government versus concealing land from the People's Government. In addition, the cadre strength is weak and the work base is poor. Therefore, after "self-reporting and public discussion," the number of land acres generally decreased compared to the Kuomintang era. For example, last year, Hubei reduced by 5.89 million mu, Jiangxi reduced by 8 million mu, and many counties in Zhejiang reduced by about 40%. Although the number of acres increased repeatedly after vigorous efforts to expose concealed land, it was still less than the number during the enemy era.

    Universal measurement can also clarify the land situation, but due to the large area, heavy tasks, many concerns of the masses, short time, few cadres, and lack of work experience, it also failed to achieve good results. For example, in Kaijian and Jiangru counties in Guangdong, cadres and activists were immersed in technical aspects such as inserting signs, matching signs, measuring, and calculating, so that "large pieces of concealed land cannot be found, and one li and two li are in a mess." In Xiaoping Township, Zhijiang County, Hunan, universal measurement was conducted for fifteen days, and the land was reduced by more than 22,000 mu compared to the Kuomintang era. The masses said, "Fifteen days of work, 22,000 mu less, concealed land cannot be found, landlords laugh." These experiences are very realistic, and we should learn from them.

    Method (3) once exposed some concealed land. From the surface, the masses seemed to be mobilized, but in reality, because the masses did not fully understand the fair and reasonable policy, concealed land still existed everywhere. Sometimes, in order to complete the task, even "compulsory assignment of concealed land" occurred. Especially since the emphasis on tax calculation according to rate, "task contracting" is more likely to create a contradiction between the tax rate and the task. For example, in Wulijie Township, Wuchang County, Hubei, the original allocation was 150,000 jin. The township adopted the contract system. After the concealed land was found, the burden rate of each household was reduced by an average of 48% compared to tax calculation according to rate.

    Method (4) was successful because it had old materials as a basis, which made it easier to obtain the truth than completely lacking materials and blindly self-reporting measurement. Last year, Southern Jiangsu adopted this method and achieved success. In Songjiang alone, the concealed land exposed exceeded 320,000 fu yuan (enemy burden unit) during the enemy era. Zhejiang also used this method before this year's autumn collection, and the number of acres also increased. According to statistics from Shaoxing Special District, the increase was generally 20% to 40% in general counties, and up to 69% in individual areas. According to statistics from Jiaxing Special District, the increase was between 15% and 20%. At the same time, the general peasants' awareness was also universally improved because they fully understood the harm of "one person concealing land, everyone suffers" and "landlords conceal a piece of land, poor people conceal a little."

    (III)
    However, old materials are very complex, and their complexity is reflected in the following aspects:

    (1) The old work base is unbalanced, resulting in inconsistent authenticity of the materials. Taking Hunan, Zhejiang, and Jiangxi provinces as examples, the three provinces can be roughly divided into three types of regions. For example, Hunan's "land measurement" and "land declaration" used old mu. Jiangxi's "aerial survey," "land declaration," and "measurement registration," and Zhejiang's "land measurement," "measurement registration," and "stipulated land price," etc. In the first type of region in each province, the registers and maps are relatively complete and the figures are relatively accurate. According to the materials from Zhejiang's land consolidation this summer, their authenticity is about 97%. In the third type of region, the materials are incomplete and the accuracy is lower. According to Zhejiang statistics, it is generally only 70% to 80%, and 50% to 60% in individual areas. For example, the accuracy of the materials in Changxing County is 80% for fields, 70% for land, and only 50% for mountains.

    (2) There are many types of materials, and there are often several types in the same area. For example, in Zhejiang's "land measurement" areas, there are so-called "household land original map," "distribution map," "land register," "land ownership register," "field tax register," "household register," etc. In the Central and Southern Region, areas that have undergone land measurement have: ① Hill boundary map: listing place names, land categories, locations, and directions, which can be used to find the owner's name and the number of acres owned; ② Land register: only listing numbers and acres; ③ Land tax household register: listing the householder's name, the total number of land acres in the whole household, etc.

    (3) Tax officials, bribed by landlords and local tyrants, often cause the accuracy of materials to be low in areas with concentrated land and high in areas with dispersed land.

    Based on the above situation, it can be seen that old materials must be sorted and analyzed before they can be used. The sorting method should vary from region to region, adopt different methods, and select a reliable material as the center in each region, compare it with other materials, and examine its degree of authenticity, so as to avoid being trapped in a pile of complex materials and being at a loss, and even more so to avoid treating all old materials equally. In general, areas with maps should first check the maps, verify them piece by piece, and then summarize the total number of land acres for the whole household. In areas without maps but have been compiled and checked by household, the compiled and checked registers should be the main focus, and the uncompiled and unchecked registers should be secondary. In areas where registers are lost, old field tax personnel can be used to sort them out. Areas where the number of autumn grain collection last year has exceeded the number of old materials should further expose concealed land and generally do not need to emphasize using old materials again.

    In addition, there are many unreasonable aspects in old materials, so they must be fully reformed when used. The items that need to be reformed generally include the following points in general areas:

    (1) Kuomintang's old materials often have virtual households, virtual names, false households, and false names. For example, in Pingwen Village, Wuming County, Guangxi, there are actually 330 households, but the old materials show 666 households, of which nearly half of the households used two or more names, and many households shared one name. For example, there are seven households in the village with names like Huang Daomin and Huang Jinmin, etc. Because their great-great-grandfather was Huang Li Hui, the seven households still used Huang Li Hui's name to pay grain after five generations. In terms of registration methods, statistics are mostly based on land plots (i.e., the so-called "hill boundary household system"). "The agricultural tax in newly liberated areas is levied progressively on a household basis..." Therefore, the statistical method based on land plots must be changed to statistics on a household basis, and virtual households and virtual names must be corrected, and false households and false names must be verified in order to facilitate the implementation of progressive tax.

    (2) As mentioned earlier, old materials mostly register land ownership, and house foundations and interstitial land with property rights but no income are also included. The agricultural tax in newly liberated areas is levied according to the amount of income, so this type of land must be extracted.

    (3) Old materials only register land owners and cannot indicate tenancy relations, so they must be noted and statistically distinguished according to self-cultivation, leasing, and tenant farming, so as to calculate the tax amount in accordance with Article 15 of the Provisional Regulations.

    (4) In old materials, there are so-called "waste strings" or "headless strings," which are mostly acts of concealing landlords and shifting burdens and should be cleared out.

    (5) In some areas, the old materials distinguish between cultivated land and non-cultivated land, but the "cultivated land" referred to mostly refers to land planted with main grains, and land planted with new grains and cash crops is mostly not registered. According to a survey in Linxiang County, Hunan, this type of land reached 226,800 mu, while the cultivated land counted in the county was only 190,000 mu. Last year's survey of cultivated land also did not include it. In accordance with the principle that "all land with agricultural income... shall be subject to agricultural tax by the income earner," this type of land should be added.

    (6) In Yiyang County, Jiangxi, and other counties, it was also found that the Kuomintang's statistics on cultivated land were divided into three grades: upper, middle, and lower. The figures mastered at the county level were the total number of upper-grade fields converted from land of each grade. Therefore, when using old materials in this type of area, the original number of "natural mu" must be obtained, otherwise it will cause a disconnection between the upper and lower numbers.

    When sorting out and reforming the Kuomintang's old materials, local old field grain personnel (such as map Baozheng or tax collectors or clerks) must be absorbed; the positions of these personnel are hereditary "iron rice bowls," and they have a clear understanding of the situation. If they can be properly reformed, they can indeed play a role. Zhejiang initially feared increasing expenditures during the autumn grain collection last year and did not dare to absorb them, resulting in "saving sesame seeds and losing watermelons." On the contrary, this year, the province collectively trained 3,436 of the above-mentioned personnel and more than 2,000 primary school teachers and students to participate in land consolidation work, resulting in significant achievements. However, it must be noted that these personnel should first be fully educated ideologically to make them realize the bright future of serving the people. According to the experience of Southern Jiangsu last year, it is advisable to concentrate the employment of this type of personnel in the county seat. If they are distributed to the countryside, they may still be controlled by landlords.

    (IV)
    After the registers are sorted out by household according to the aforementioned methods, they shall be distributed to various townships (villages) and posted for public announcement. On the one hand, the masses will discuss and correct them, and on the other hand, the masses can be mobilized to expose concealed land.

    Exposing concealed land is an acute class struggle. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen the peasants' understanding of class interests and policies and laws, and to use specific facts or accounting methods to dispel the masses' ideological concerns and make the masses understand the harm of concealing land to the peasants themselves.

    According to current understanding, peasants generally have the following concerns about land surveys:

    (1) Poor peasants fear that after reporting truthfully, they will be allocated less land. Coupled with the rumors and threats of lawless elements, they are even more afraid that landlords will take back the land and not let them cultivate.

    (2) Middle peasants fear that after reporting truthfully, their class status will change and they will become the object of struggle.

    (3) Rich peasants fear that their land will be "cut off" after reporting truthfully.

    (4) Between villages and villages, and between households and households, they fear that if they report truthfully, the outside villages and households will not, and they will suffer losses. Lawless elements take the opportunity to use various methods to organize collective concealment, such as telling peasants: "Good people protect three villages, good dogs protect three neighbors," and use gifts and other methods to buy over activists among the peasants. They say: "Rabbits don't eat grass near their own nests."

    From this, it can be seen that we must patiently explain various policies to make peasants understand the pros and cons. Peasants in Pingwen Village, Wuming County, Guangxi, initially had various concerns and collectively concealed their land. After their concerns were dispelled, they first reported truthfully themselves and actively reported the large amount of land concealed by landlords. In the method of reporting concealed land, special attention should be paid to mobilizing tenants. Various places in Guizhou adopted the method of tenants and landlords filling out forms separately for mutual verification, which was very successful. The specific method is that on the one hand, the peasant association distributes a form to the tenants, listing the place name, number of mu, location, and the owner's name, etc. On the other hand, the township government distributes a form to the landlords, listing the total number of mu in the whole household, the total number of plots, the location and number of mu of each plot, and the names of the tenants, etc. After the two forms are filled out and verified with each other, they are compared with the old materials that have been sorted out earlier. If contradictions are found, they are gradually investigated.

    For enlightened landlords, efforts should be made to win them over in order to isolate stubborn elements. In the process of winning them over, attention should be paid to explaining policies and laws, pointing out the obligation to abide by the law and report field acres truthfully, and soliciting their opinions on land surveys, and timely exposing their various tricks of concealing land. Appropriate punishment should be given to those who conspire to sabotage, but this power of punishment should be in the hands of the county people's government. When Guo Long Village, Chaoan County, Guangdong, began to investigate concealed land, the landlords held secret meetings to instigate and organize a "concealed land front." After the conspiracy organizer Guo Zhao Da was exposed and given appropriate punishment, the peasants realized that they had been fooled, and the enlightened and neutral landlords apologized one after another. As a result, the whole village voluntarily reported more than 3,000 mu of concealed land.

    In short, the central link in the work of exposing concealed land is to improve the masses' awareness, mobilize and organize the strength of the masses, and put policies and laws in the hands of the masses. In this way, even if there are difficulties, they can be easily overcome.

　　怎样进行新区土地调查工作
    易之
    （一）
    新区，土地亩数极不真实，黑瞒田大量存在，据去年秋征前期材料，湖南瞒田一般达百分之三十，浙江达百分之二十五，湖北达百分之三十至四十，广东达百分之三十至五十，福建典型材料达百分之五十以上，陕西典型材料一般在百分之四十左右。瞒田户主要是地主（包括祠堂、庙宇等集团地主的土地），据川南内江县礼茂乡调查，全乡查出的黑田一○一二一·二亩中，地主占百分之八四·六，仁寿县三保七甲三家地主的瞒田即达全保的百分之七十二。其次是富农，据浙江宁波专区三县三村统计，地主瞒田占其所有土地总数百分之三五·三，富农占百分之二二·五，中农占百分之一四·○一，贫农占百分之一○·五。
    《新解放区农业税暂行条例》第三条规定：“凡有农业收入的土地，除本条例另有规定者外，均由其收入所得人交纳农业税”。《中华人民共和国土地改革法》第十一条规定：“分配土地……在原畊基础上，按土地数量、质量及其位置远近……按人口统一分配之。”因此，查实农村畊地的数量，不仅直接为贯彻新区农业税制打下基础，而且也可以为土地改革提供良好的条件。
    （二）
    过去，调查新区土地所采取的方式很多，但主要的为下述四种：
    （１）完全撇开国民党时代的旧材料，重新“逐户登记”“自报公议”。
    （２）普遍丈量。
    （３）“任务包干”。先将任务布置到村，然后向群众宣布：“任务包了干，反出黑田不增加负担。”借以鼓励群众反黑田。
    （４）改造国民党时代的旧材料，并发动群众反黑田。
    经验证明第（１）第（２）两种方式是失败的，第（３）种方式虽然反出不少黑田，但缺点很多。比较成功的是第（４）种。
    为什么第（１）和第（２）种方式都失败了呢？因为第一种是老区的调查方式，不适于新区的具体情况。第二种则忽视了发动群众，只着重技术方面。事实上任何一种调查工作如果忽视了发动群众，就不可能获得良好的结果，而方式的选择，则与群众的觉悟程度和组织程度关系极为密切。新区农民的觉悟程度和组织程度不如老区，他们对伪政府隐瞒土地和对人民政府隐瞒土地的利害还不很分得清楚。加以干部力量较弱，工作基础较差，因此“自报公议”之后，田亩普遍比国民党时代减少，如去年湖北减少五八九万亩，江西减少八○○万亩，浙江很多县减少百分之四十左右，以后虽经大力反黑田，亩数迭有增加，但仍不及敌人时代的数字。
    普遍丈量虽然也可以把土地搞清楚，惜乎地区大、任务大、群众顾虑多、时间短、干部少、工作经验差，因此也同样得不到好的结果，正如广东开建、江如等县为了丈量土地，干部和积极分子整天陷入插签、对签、丈量、计算等技术圈子里，以致“大块黑田查不出，一厘两厘乱糟糟”。湖南芷江县晓坪乡普遍丈了十五天，土地比国民党时代少了二万二千多亩，群众说“功夫十五天，少了两万二，黑田查不出，地主笑哈哈”。这种经验都是很现实的，我们应引为教训。
    第（３）种方式曾经反出了一些黑田，从表面上看，群众似乎是发动起来了，但实际因未彻底使群众了解公平合理的政策，还是到处存在黑地，有时为了完成任务，甚至“强派黑田”。特别自强调依率计征以来，“任务包干”更容易造成税率与任务的矛盾，如湖北武昌县五里界乡原分配十五万斤，该乡采包干制，查出瞒田以后，各户的负担率平均比依率计征减低百分之四十八。
    第（４）种方式所以成功是因为有旧材料作基础，比完全无材料、盲目自报丈量容易弄到真实。去年苏南采用此一办法，获得了成绩，仅松江一个分区，反出黑田超过敌人时代三十二万赋元（敌人负担单位）；浙江今年秋前采用此种办法，亩数亦有增加；据绍兴专区统计一般县增加百分之二十至四十，个别地区增加达百分之六九；嘉兴专区统计增加百分之十五至二十之间。同时一般农民的觉悟程度，亦因充分了解了“一人瞒田，大家吃亏”“地主瞒田一片，穷人瞒田一点”的害处，乃得普遍提高。
    （三）
    但是，旧材料是非常复杂的，其复杂性表现在下述几方面：
    （１）旧日的工作基础不平衡，以致材料的真实性不一致。举湖南、浙江、江西三省为例，三省大体又可分三类地区，如湖南的“土地测量”、“土地陈报”，袭用老亩；江西的“航空测量”、“土地陈报”、“测量登记”，浙江的“土地测量”、“测量登记”、“规定地价”等等，各省中以第一类地区，册籍图额比较完整，数字比较正确，据今夏浙江土地整理的材料看，其真实性约达百分之九七。第三类地区材料不全，正确性较小，据浙江统计，一般只有七、八成，个别地区为五、六成，如长兴县材料的正确性，田为八成，地为七成，山只有五成。
    （２）材料的种类很多，往往同一地区便有好几种。如浙江“土地测量”地区有所谓“户地原图”、“分布图”、“地籍表”、“土地所有权清册”、“田赋清册”、“归户册”等等，中南区经过土地测量的地区，有①丘领图：列有地名、地目、部位、方向，凭图可找出业主姓名及所有亩数；②土地清册：仅列有号数及亩数；③地税户册：列有户主姓名、全户土地亩数等。
    （３）赋吏受地主、豪绅的贿赂，往往造成在土地集中地区的材料正确性小，土地分散的地区正确性大。
    根据上述情况，可见旧的材料必须先加整理、分析，始能利用。整理的办法，应分别不同地区、采用不同的方法，并应在每一地区挑选一种可靠的材料作为中心，对照其它材料，审定其真实程度，以免陷入庞杂的材料堆中莫衷一是，更不能将所有旧材料一视同仁。一般有图的地区应该先对图，逐块核对以后，再综合其全户土地亩数；无图而已按户为单位加以编查过的地区，应以编查过的册籍为主，未经编查过的册籍为辅；册籍失散地区，可酌用旧田赋人员加以整理。去年秋征数字已经超过旧材料数字的地区，应进一步反瞒田，一般可不用再强调参用旧材料。
    此外，旧材料还有很多不合理的地方，故在利用时须充分予以改造，其须要改造的项目，一般地区有下列几点：
    （１）国民党的旧材料，多化户、化名、假户、假名。如广西武鸣县平稳村实有业户三三○户，而旧材料上却有六六六户，其中几有半数的户兼用了两个或两个以上的名字，也有很多户共着一个名字。如该村有黄道民、黄进民等七户，因其高祖父为黄礼会，五世相传，该七户仍都沿用黄礼会的名字纳粮。在登记的方法上，多以地块为单位统计（即所谓“丘领户制”），“新解放区的农业税以户为单位……累进计征”，故须将以地块为单位的统计方法，改依户为单位统计，并须改正化户、化名，查实假户、假名，以便于实行累进税。
    （２）如前所述，旧材料多依土地所有权登记，有产权而无收益的房基隙地，亦予计入。新解放区农业税按收益量计征，故须将该类土地摘出。
    （３）旧材料仅登记土地所有人，不能表明租佃关系，故须注明，并分别依照自耕、出租和佃耕加以统计，以便按暂行条例第十五条的规定，折合计算税额。
    （４）旧材料中有所谓“废串”或“没头串”，多系掩蔽地主转嫁负担的勾当，应予清出。
    （５）有些地区的旧材料，虽有耕地和非耕地的区分，然所指“耕地”，多数系种植主要谷物的，此外种植新粮及经济作物的土地多未登记，该类土地据湖南临湘一县调查，即达二十二万六千八百亩，该县所计之耕地，则仅十九万亩，去年调查耕地，亦未计入。依照“凡有农业收入的土地……均得由其收入所得人交纳农业税的原则”，该类土地应予补入。
    （６）在江西弋阳等县，还发现国民党统计的耕地分上、中、下三等，县级所掌握的数字，是各等土地折计上等田的总数，因此在该类地区利用旧材料时，须求出原来的“自然亩”数，不然会造成上下数字脱节。
    整理和改造国民党的旧材料时必须吸收当地的旧田粮人员（各图保正或催征吏或册书）；这类人员的职务是世袭的“铁饭碗”，对情况了解清楚，若能善加改造，确是起作用的。浙江去年秋征初期因为怕增加开支，未敢吸收他们，结果“省了芝麻，丢了西瓜”。相反，今年全省集训了上述人员三、四三六人、小学教员及学生二、○○○余人，参加土地整理工作，结果收到了显著的成绩。但须注意对这些人员应先充分加以思想教育，使他们认识为人民服务的光明前途。另据苏南去年经验，该类人员的任用，以集中于县城为宜，如分发至乡村，则仍可能为地主控制。
    （四）
    依前述办法将册籍分户整理完竣后，分发各乡（村）张榜公布，一方面由群众讨论校正，一方面即可发动群众反黑田。
    反黑田是一个尖锐的阶级斗争，因此必须加强农民对于阶级利益与政策法令的认识，更须用具体事实或算帐方法解除群众的思想顾虑，使群众明了瞒隐土地对于农民本身的害处。
    据目前的了解，农民对调查土地，大概有这样几种顾虑：
    （１）贫农惟恐实报之后，自己少分土地，加上不法分子的造谣威胁，更害怕地主收回土地，不让耕种。
    （２）中农怕报实之后，改变了自己的成份，成为斗争的对象。
    （３）富农怕报实之后“割去”自己的土地。
    （４）村与村、户与户间，则怕自己报实了，外村外户不实，自己吃亏；不法分子便趁机利用各种方法，组织集体瞒报，如向农民说：“好人护三村，好狗护三邻”，并用赠送等方式，收买农民中的积极分子，他们说：“兔子不吃窝边草”。
    由此可见我们必须耐心的解释各种政策，使农民懂得其间的利害关系。广西武鸣县平稳村的农民，开始存在各种顾虑，集体瞒报；顾虑打消后，首先自己实报，并积极检举地主的大量瞒田。在检举瞒田的方法上，应特别注意发动佃户，贵州各地采取租佃双方分别填报相互核对的方法，结果非常成功。其具体作法，即一方面通过农民协会给佃户发下一张表式，上面列有地名、亩数、座落及业主姓名等等，另一方面通过乡政府发给地主一张表式，上面列有全户总亩数，总丘数、各丘土地的座落、亩数、及佃户姓名等等，两表填妥后相互对照，并与前面所整理的旧材料核对，发现其中的矛盾，然后逐步追究。
    对于开明地主应该设法争取，俾孤立顽固分子，在争取过程中应注意解释政策法令，指出奉公守法，实报田亩的义务，并征求他们对调查土地的意见，及时揭露他们瞒田的各种花样。对阴谋破坏分子应予以应得的处分，但此项处分权应由县人民政府掌握。广东潮安县郭陇村开始查瞒田时，地主召开秘密会议，进行煽动，组织“瞒田阵线”，经揭穿并对其阴谋组织者郭昭大给予适当处分以后，农民自知上当，开明和中立的地主纷纷道歉，结果全村自动报出瞒田三千余亩。
    总之，反黑田工作的中心环节，在提高群众的觉悟程度，发动并组织群众的力量，使政策法令掌握于群众手中。这样即使有困难，也就容易克服了。
