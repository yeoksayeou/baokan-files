　　Following the publication of the "Joint Declaration of Democratic Parties," the entire workforce of Beijing was filled with righteous indignation and boiling enthusiasm, unanimously expressing their complete support for the declaration and their determination to resist America, aid Korea, and extinguish the flames of aggression. Many workers throughout the city requested to join the Volunteer Army and go to Korea to fight alongside the Korean people. They also proposed launching a patriotic production competition to actively support the Korean people and protect their homes and defend the nation. On the 6th, the Beijing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions specially convened an emergency meeting of more than 100 people, including chairmen of factory trade unions, heads of cultural and educational departments, directors of district trade union offices, and members of cultural and educational committees, to discuss taking practical actions to support the "Joint Declaration of Democratic Parties" and launching a mass campaign among workers to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes and defend the nation. The meeting began with a report by Liu Laifu, Vice Chairman of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions. He first pointed out that since the American imperialists expanded their war of aggression and extended the flames of war to our borders, seriously threatening our national security, the city's workers have been closely watching the American imperialists' frantic actions and demanding active actions to resist America and aid Korea to achieve the purpose of protecting their homes and defending the nation. This demand is entirely correct and entirely in line with justice. Now that the "Joint Declaration of Democratic Parties" has been published, it represents the will of all our workers. We fully support this declaration and will respond to its call with the practical actions of all our workers. To this end, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions proposes: First, to widely and deeply carry out propaganda and mobilization work to hate, despise, and scorn American imperialism, eliminate pro-American slavish remarks and influences, correct the fear of America in the minds of a few people, and make the masses thoroughly realize the ferocity of American imperialism, just like the ferocity of Japanese imperialism's aggression against China. Second, support workers who voluntarily sign up to join the Volunteer Army and go directly to resist the atrocities of American imperialism alongside the Korean people and stop American imperialism's aggression. Third, all factories and enterprises in the city should widely launch a patriotic production competition to improve quality and reduce costs, unite workers with the spirit of "machines as weapons, factories as battlefields," and strive to complete or exceed the production plans of individuals, groups, workshops, and the entire factory; trade union workers must work actively and jointly with all workers to support the Korean people, consolidate national defense, and defend world peace, and bring out a spirit of intense and selfless work. Fourth, raise vigilance, strengthen the protection of factories and machines, and strengthen the organization of fire prevention, anti-espionage, and air defense work. Crush the sabotage conspiracies of American imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and eliminate all counter-revolutionary rumors by tracing the source of the rumors.
　　Comrades who attended the meeting spoke one after another, unanimously expressing their complete agreement with Comrade Liu Laifu's report. Comrade Li Gonglu of the People's Printing Factory said: After the publication of the Joint Declaration of Democratic Parties, the workers of our factory unanimously supported it and are enthusiastically discussing ways to voluntarily aid Korea. Some people are willing to join the Volunteer Army, and about 400 people have already signed up. An old worker said: I was oppressed for decades in the past, and I finally looked forward to liberation. Now that American imperialism wants to take away my rice bowl, I will resolutely fight him. Comrade Wang Weimin of the Clothing Factory said: The vast majority of workers in our factory advocate supporting the Korean people with practical actions and materials. Now, after ten hours of work, in addition to normal cultural learning, all the workers in the factory study current affairs on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday evenings, showing close concern for the current situation. An old woman in our factory, Aunt Jiao, who is already 61 years old, had previously requested retirement. Now, for the crash task, she works an extra hour of night shift. The old woman puts on her glasses and works with everyone. She said: When the country has such an emergency task, although I am old, I still have to use as much energy as I can to sew one more stitch and hit one more enemy. Comrade Cui Zhengwen of the Third District Office of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions said: After reading the declaration yesterday, all the staff and service personnel of the Third District Office were willing to sign up to join the Volunteer Army. A correspondent comrade said: When I go to the front line, I will be a good correspondent, ensuring that letters are delivered quickly and accurately. In the rear, I will ensure that the staff of the agency always have boiling water to drink so that everyone can work better. A female comrade, although very old, said that she could go to the front line as a nurse. At that time, everyone unanimously advocated doing a good job in trade union work and resisting America and aiding Korea with daily practical actions. The three printing factories, Xinhua, Jiefang, and Qingnian, in the Third District have already proposed: To support the Korean people and stop American imperialist aggression, launch a production competition. Among workers in private factories and industries, meetings of trade union cadres and group leaders have also been convened. Tricycle workers recalled the slavish life of cattle and horses before liberation, and said one after another: In the past, when the Japanese were here, they were kicked and beaten by Japanese devils; when the Kuomintang came, they were kicked and beaten by Kuomintang police soldiers and American devils, and they ate mixed noodles and gruel. After finally being liberated and becoming the masters, eating rice and white flour, the American devils want to come again, we must resolutely stop them and never let them come. Comrade Yu Hong of the Eighth District Office suggested that trade union cadres should launch a work competition to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes and defend the nation. Comrade Lu Zhui of the Fourth District Office said: Now there is only one word for the workers in our entire district: "Fight!" Yesterday, all 126 working comrades in the district passed a resolution: expressing firm support for the declaration, and to energetically organize the strength of more than 20,000 workers in the district to resist America and aid Korea. Comrade Wang Kewu of the Telecommunications Bureau said that we have held several seminars before and after, and the Standing Committee of the Trade Union has now decided to call on all employees to launch a patriotic production competition. This competition includes the following four characteristics: (1) Guarantee smooth telecommunications, (2) Obey organizational arrangements and complete production and emergency tasks, (3) Strictly protect state secrets, (4) Prevent espionage, prevent air raids, prevent fires, and prevent theft. Now, we must better unite all management personnel and technical personnel to jointly participate in the production competition and work together to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes and defend the nation.
