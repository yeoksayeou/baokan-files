Xinhua News Agency, New York, November 21st: Vyshinsky, head of the Soviet delegation, delivered a speech at the plenary session of the United Nations General Assembly on November 18. The full text is as follows:

We are about to begin discussing the issue of the "Draft Twenty-Year Program for Peace through the United Nations." The Soviet Union is willing to support all measures, both within and outside the United Nations, aimed at maintaining and strengthening international peace and the security of all nations, provided that these measures are genuinely aimed at achieving these goals.

		The Soviet People Advocate the Peaceful Coexistence of Two Systems - The Soviet Government Has Repeatedly Proposed Strengthening Peace
Since its establishment, the Soviet state has consistently and unwaveringly implemented a policy of peace and international cooperation. In implementing this policy, the Soviet Union proceeded from the premise that the coexistence of two systems—the socialist system and the capitalist system—is possible. U.I. Lenin and J.V. Stalin, the leaders of the Soviet people, repeatedly affirmed that these two systems can coexist. The Soviet people firmly advocate the peaceful coexistence of these two systems because, like the people of other countries, they want to consolidate peace.

The Soviet Union is implementing a policy of peace and therefore demands that measures be taken to guarantee international peace. The Soviet government has been implementing this policy since the first day of the Great October Socialist Revolution, which marked the beginning of a new era in history. The foreign policy of the Soviet state is imbued with the idea of striving for peace and international cooperation in its relations with other countries and in the international organizations in which the Soviet Union participates.

Therefore, the Soviet government has repeatedly submitted proposals to the United Nations for consideration regarding the strengthening of peace and security. These suggestions are well known to the representatives of the General Assembly.

These suggestions include: a suggestion to conclude an international convention on the unconditional prohibition of atomic weapons and the establishment of strict international control to supervise the implementation of this prohibition; suggestions to reduce armaments and armed forces; measures to oppose the propaganda of a new war and those who incite a new war; a ban on atomic weapons and a one-third reduction in the armaments and armed forces of the five permanent members of the Security Council, and the conclusion of a pact to strengthen peace by these five major powers.

As is well known, several of these suggestions formed the basis of the recommendations adopted by the General Assembly. In this session of the General Assembly, for the same lofty goals—strengthening peace and ensuring the security of all nations—the Soviet government has proposed a draft declaration on stopping the threat of a new war and consolidating world peace and security, as well as a proposal on the definition of aggression and several other proposals.

At present, when aggressive forces are rising in some countries and taking practical steps to launch a new war, when these forces are preparing methods of aggression and want to attack the peaceful residents of other countries with atomic weapons, when there has already been direct aggression against the Korean people, who are fighting heroically for their independence and against foreign encroachment—at such a time, it is particularly important and necessary to formulate a plan to achieve lasting peace through the United Nations (as Marshal Stalin pointed out, the United Nations is an important tool for maintaining peace and international security), in order to do everything possible to stop aggression and ensure peaceful cooperation between all countries, large and small.

The Soviet delegation believes that the General Assembly should take into account the firm will of the people of all countries to strive for peace. These people have signed hundreds of millions of names on the Stockholm Appeal, thereby expressing their determination to strengthen peace and stop the threat of a new war.

The Soviet delegation is fully confident that it is the responsibility of the General Assembly to take measures to stop the propaganda of a new war, to ban weapons of aggression and weapons of mass destruction of humanity—atomic weapons and other tools for mass destruction of humanity; to take measures to reduce the armaments and armed forces of the five major powers by one-third in 1950-1951, and to raise the issue of further reductions in armed forces at the next session of the General Assembly—this is exactly what we suggest in our draft declaration, which, unfortunately, was rejected by the General Assembly; and, finally, to take measures to conclude a pact to strengthen peace by the five major powers, which could instill a belief that the five major powers are all working towards this great goal and that this would be a step towards strengthening international trust.

Although the General Assembly rejected the Soviet proposals, particularly the request to adopt the declaration on stopping the threat of a new war and consolidating world peace and security, the Soviet Union will continue to strive for the realization of these goals in the future, and will make every effort to achieve these goals as quickly and as fully as possible.

The tasks outlined in the Soviet draft declaration are still on the agenda of the General Assembly for discussion, especially since there is also the issue of formulating a long-term plan to guarantee international peace. We must state from the outset that if such a plan ignores tasks such as stopping the propaganda of a new war, unconditionally banning atomic weapons and establishing effective international control to supervise the implementation of this prohibition, reducing armaments, especially the armaments of major powers, resolving differences between major powers, and signing a pact by them to strengthen peace, it is meaningless and empty talk. It is impossible to seriously conceive of formulating any plan for peace through the United Nations without striving to fulfill these tasks.

In his speech yesterday, the Secretary-General, when talking about the aggression in Korea, insisted that the aggression came from North Korea. He reiterated what the representatives of the US-British bloc have said here, shifting the responsibility for the Korean military incidents from the guilty to the innocent.

The Secretary-General's statement contradicts the truth. We have repeatedly presented and cited many documents and evidence in the Political Committee and here in the General Assembly to confirm the fact that the United States is the aggressor in Korea. No one has tried to refute these documents, and no one can refute them.

Moreover, the attackers even refused to listen to the opinions of the representatives of the People's Democratic Republic of North Korea in the Political Committee and the General Assembly, obviously fearing that the evidence of the representatives of the Korean people would once again prove that the claim that the aggression came from North Korea is untenable. In this regard, it is interesting to point out that, according to a November 3 dispatch from Seoul by the Associated Press, a large number of representatives of the South Korean National Assembly submitted a petition stating that the government of Syngman Rhee, a well-known servant of the American ruling group, should be held responsible for the war and the destruction suffered by Korea as a result. It is becoming increasingly clear that American monopoly capitalists are responsible for the Korean War.

The Korean events have strengthened the will of the people of all countries to stop further aggression and maintain peace and security. The peace movement has grown stronger, and we should support this movement in every possible way, because it is in the fundamental interests of all peace-loving people.

Important International Issues Concerning the Interests of the Whole World Cannot Be Decided Without China's Participation in the United Nations
In putting forward proposals to strengthen peace and international security, the Soviet government has always expressed and now expresses its willingness to consider any proposals aimed at achieving the same goals. Therefore, the Soviet government takes a positive attitude towards the suggestion that the United Nations formulate a twenty-year peace plan. The Soviet government agrees with the statement in the memorandum that measures can be effectively taken through the United Nations to stop the so-called Cold War and help strengthen peace.

Currently, there are some important issues that, unless resolved, make it impossible to implement any genuine plan for peace through the United Nations. These issues include the issue of China's representation in the United Nations, the issue of unconditional prohibition of atomic weapons and international control, the issue of limiting and reducing all armaments and armed forces, and several other issues that I have already discussed.

Let us see how these issues are presented in the memorandum and how it suggests resolving them.

The Soviet Union agrees with the statement in the memorandum that no common progress can be made in the cause of strengthening peace unless the issue of China's cooperation in the United Nations is resolved. The Soviet government is prepared—as it has in fact demonstrated since the opening of this session and in the past—to support several suggestions in the memorandum, such as resuming negotiations on the issue of atomic energy based on the instructions decided by the Fourth General Assembly, and concluding agreements on limiting and reducing all armaments, etc.

But at the same time, the Soviet delegation believes it must point out the essential shortcomings of the plan proposed in the memorandum. First of all, the memorandum is one-sided. For example, the memorandum raises the important issue of convening regular meetings of the Security Council in accordance with Article 28 of the Charter. As pointed out in the memorandum, the regular meetings of the Security Council should be used by high-ranking officials to generally consider unresolved issues of the United Nations, especially those issues on which there are serious differences between the permanent members of the Security Council, the so-called major powers.

I have pointed out that the suggestion to convene regular meetings of the Security Council is based on Article 28 of the Charter, which stipulates that "each member of the Council may, whenever it deems appropriate, send government ministers or other specially designated representatives to attend" these meetings. But the memorandum makes no mention whatsoever of the important issue of China's representation on the Security Council. The Soviet delegation believes this is wrong. We support the suggestion to convene regular meetings of the Security Council. We know that in order to strive for peace, we must not ignore any possibility provided by the United Nations Charter, and that in order to eliminate the threat of a new war, we must strive to ensure lasting and consolidated peace among all nations. We have such a belief, that convening regular meetings of the Security Council will undoubtedly help to activate the Security Council's work in resolving issues; this work is the task entrusted to the Security Council by the United Nations Charter, and according to this task, it is the Security Council that bears the primary responsibility for maintaining peace. The fact that the memorandum does not mention the important issue of China's representation on the Security Council shows that the author of the memorandum is echoing the position held by those governments that are unwilling to seek international consolidated and lasting peace.

The fact that the memorandum does not mention this issue at all also proves that the author of the memorandum is unwilling to guarantee the primary condition for cooperation in the United Nations organization—recognizing the indisputable right of the Chinese people to send their authorized representatives here, and expelling those swindlers from our organization who do not represent the Chinese people at all, but only represent the rotten Kuomintang group that has been thrown into the dustbin of history by the heroic hands of the great Chinese people.

The Soviet delegation believes that regular meetings of the Security Council should be held with the participation of all members of the Council, represented by the legitimate governments recognized by their people and exercising real power in the country. No reason whatsoever, especially erroneous and absurd reasons, can prevent the governments that have the right to be represented on the Security Council from participating in the work of the Security Council and the work of other United Nations agencies, as is currently preventing the government of the People's Republic of China.

The Kuomintang group was driven out of its own country and is hiding in Taiwan under the protection of the American army. Their representatives' participation in the work of various agencies of the United Nations organization and in the work of regular meetings of the Security Council (if the meetings were to begin now) cannot be considered legitimate.

The Soviet delegation believes that in order to implement the important provision in the Charter regarding the convening of regular meetings of the Security Council, it is first necessary to resolve the issue of China's representation, so the peace plan stipulates that the Security Council should perform its duties with the attendance of all members of the Council and the participation of representatives of the People's Republic of China. Passing such a suggestion would create a real foundation for making the work of the Security Council effective, because any important international issue affecting the interests of the whole world, of course, cannot be decided in the United Nations without the participation of the representatives of one of the major powers—the representatives of the 475 million Chinese people, the People's Republic of China.

Lie's Memorandum Attempts to Limit the Principle of Great Power Unanimity
Proving That He is a Mouthpiece of the US-British Ruling Group
The memorandum suggests renewing efforts to seek an agreement among the major powers regarding the limitation of the application of the principle of great power unanimity in the work of the Security Council. This is an absolutely unacceptable suggestion.

Does this fact alone not suffice to convince people of the political one-sidedness of the memorandum I just mentioned?

Does this fact alone not convince us that this memorandum is essentially a mouthpiece of the American ruling group—a mouthpiece of the US-British bloc? Is this suggestion not contrary to the United Nations Charter and does it not abandon an important fundamental principle of our organization?

We have heard suggestions of this kind more than once, and it is the representatives of that bloc who put forward these suggestions. Even if this bloc does not yet want to eliminate the principle of veto (the reason it does not eliminate it, as US representative Dulles said, is because it may one day be convenient for the United States itself), it is at least trying every possible means to limit its use, so that in the current situation, at this moment, it will not hinder the US-British bloc from completing its plans for aggressive and expansionist measures, which they are systematically forcing through in various United Nations agencies, and even in the General Assembly. Some people say that the suggestion to limit the use of the veto can create a real foundation for making the work of the Security Council effective. But justifying this suggestion with such a reason is obviously far-fetched. In essence, this suggestion is an attack on the fundamental principles of our organization as stipulated in the United Nations Charter.

It must be emphasized that raising such a question not only cannot promote the cause of world peace—or consolidate the United Nations—but, on the contrary, it is aimed at destroying the United Nations. Naturally, this is exactly what those who are planning and preparing and already implementing their expansionist plans want, their expansionist plans have one goal, which is to achieve world hegemony.

A plan to achieve peace through the United Nations cannot be built on violating the most important principles and provisions of the Charter.

This plan should be based on strictly and absolutely adhering to the Charter.

Unfortunately, especially recently, violations of the Charter have become commonplace in the United Nations. We can see this from many examples. I do not want to dwell on this point, lest I waste your time. It is enough to recall the recent decision passed here on extending the term of the Secretary-General; this Secretary-General is the author of the memorandum under discussion, and he still does not know how to respect the Charter, but as a Secretary-General, he should be the one who maintains the Charter.

For the reasons mentioned above, the Soviet delegation believes that the suggestion on limiting the use of the principle of great power unanimity is incorrect and unacceptable.

The Lie Plan Deliberately Equivocates on an Agreement on the Unconditional Prohibition of Atomic Weapons to Cover Up Aggression
There is a suggestion in the memorandum regarding the establishment of atomic energy control. We have already expressed our opinions on this issue when discussing various suggestions, mainly when discussing the Soviet draft declaration on "Stopping the Threat of a New War and Consolidating World Peace and Security", and when the First Committee discussed the eight-nation proposal; later this eight-nation proposal was submitted to the plenary session in the name of the First Committee under the grandiose title of "Peace Through Action"!

We see that the same suggestion in this proposal is repeatedly put forward in the Secretary-General's memorandum. This suggestion is also unacceptable because it is limited to requiring the establishment of international control without simultaneously prohibiting atomic weapons. In order to deceive public opinion, it pretends to require control over the prohibition of atomic weapons.

But there is no prohibition of atomic weapons now! Some people are asking us to control something that does not exist. They want to use empty and hypocritical words about international control to cover up their negative attitude towards the prohibition of atomic weapons, and to maintain the possibility of continuing to manufacture atomic weapons.

This smokescreen has long been exposed, but in the memorandum this smokescreen is used again. The memorandum talks about controlling atomic energy but does not say a word about prohibiting the use of atomic energy for military purposes.

What kind of control should be talked about? The meaning of control that we are talking about is: atomic energy should only be used for peaceful purposes, and it should be prohibited from being used for military purposes. Therefore, the manufacture of atomic weapons must be prohibited.

But this is exactly what the memorandum does not say, and what no speech by the representatives of the US-British bloc, the aggressive North Atlantic Treaty countries, says.

The memorandum repeats the formulas of the US-British bloc, which is another proof of its political one-sidedness and its pro-American nature.

Some people in the General Assembly said that Lie took his memorandum to Moscow. No, what he took to Moscow was a memorandum that had already been approved by the US State Department, that had already been agreed to by the foreign ministries of London and Paris, that is, that had already been agreed to by the entire gang of anti-peace conspirators. And only then did this memorandum appear before our eyes in Moscow.

We believe that the mere fact that the memorandum does not mention the prohibition of atomic weapons undermines people's trust in the memorandum. This situation shows that unless this memorandum is revised accordingly in the spirit I have mentioned here, it cannot be supported by anyone who is truly striving for peace.

The Soviet delegation believes—and it has repeatedly fully and clearly stated its attitude—that the inventions in the field of atomic energy have determined a task for all peace-loving people and countries, which is to conclude an international agreement on the unconditional prohibition of atomic weapons and the establishment of strict international control. However, as I have said, this memorandum is silent on this, and uses vague, empty, and hypocritical words. We have heard these words many times, and unfortunately they were adopted by the majority of the First Committee a few days ago in the resolution entitled "Peace Through Action".

But we should understand that if we do not prohibit atomic weapons and at the same time establish effective control to supervise the implementation of this prohibition, then we cannot save humanity from the threat of all the catastrophes caused by the use of atomic weapons and other major weapons of mass destruction of humanity in future wars.

The questions raised in the Secretary-General's memorandum do not point the right direction for the United Nations' efforts to strengthen international peace and security. On the contrary, it is only committed to the purpose of covering up, and these purposes have nothing in common with the lofty goal of strengthening peace. Such a presentation of the atomic energy issue is in reality nothing more than an attempt to cover up the unrestricted continuation of the manufacture of atomic weapons.

Everyone should see that without prohibiting atomic weapons, we cannot save humanity from the threat of using atomic energy for military purposes.

Therefore, the Soviet delegation believes that this plan—if it is not a hypocritical plan but a plan that is truly aimed at strengthening peace—must stipulate the unconditional prohibition of atomic weapons.

This should be the starting point of this plan on the issue of peace, because without accepting this condition, there can be no peace. But this is not what they want to do, because they do not want to truly strengthen peace.

Countless Representatives Signed the Peace Declaration, and the Slanders of the Reactionaries Cannot Scare the Peace Fighters
This explains why the Stockholm Appeal has encountered the rage of certain people, and I regret to say, the rage of people in the General Assembly. One only has to think of the situation at the meeting of the Political Committee, where the Stockholm Appeal was attacked with frantic abuse, and the supporters of the Appeal were called "fifth columnists", and those who signed the Appeal, those 500 million honest people around the world, were called traitors. I have already briefly talked about these people yesterday, and today I would like to say a little more about them in detail.

Indeed, some people even said that the Stockholm Appeal was a "conspiracy", a "trick", and the biggest fraud. The Swedish representative even expressed his apologies in the Political Committee because the name of Stockholm was used in connection with this Appeal. Perhaps he will also apologize here. Why? Because Stockholm gave its name to the largest people's movement, the peace movement, in which hundreds of millions of honest people participated. The Swedish representative apparently overlooked that this apology could only tarnish the reputation of his delegation and himself. We have already said that the people who have signed the Stockholm Appeal include tens of thousands of famous political leaders, as well as representatives of science, art, literature, and various religions and cultures.

I would like to recall the names of several political and public leaders who have signed the Stockholm Appeal in Western Europe and other countries: Britain: famous political leaders, former members of the House of Commons, Pritt and Platts-Mills; Belgium: Supreme Court Judge Dale, Van den Branden, Baron de Leeuw (former minister); Italy: parliamentarian Nenni (former minister), parliamentarian Orlando (former prime minister), De Nicola (former president), Speaker of the Lower House Gronchi; France: National Assembly member Emmanuel, Dastier de la Vigerie (former minister), National Assembly member Gode, National Assembly member Daubie (former minister), National Assembly member Father Groues, Rivière and Vermeersch, President of the Court of Appeals Lyon-Caen, Attorney General Monnier; Colombia: Dr. Acevedo (former president of the Republic), Dr. Reyes (former minister of justice), Senator Dr. Córdoba, President of the Higher Court of Arbitration Dr. Bravo; Brazil: Brazilian Congressman Goegel; Norway: Honnsrud (former prime minister); Egypt: Chairman of the Council of State Abdel Razak el-Sanhuri, parliamentarian Liwa Aitohamid Fatou General; Australia: Senators Morrow, Flaherty and Ward; Iran: Deputy Speaker of the Parliament Moussemi, parliamentarians Foradwend, Doulat, Medi Abebu and Seifi; Lebanon: Lebanese Parliamentarian Sheikh Selim Kazan; Mexico: Dórber (former minister), General Cárdenas (former president of the Republic of Mexico), Interior Minister García; Finland: Prime Minister Kekkonen, members of the Agrarian League, Rusteli Ningwei Inno Simoinen, Virolainen, Eskola, Ruinko, Sari and Lepihan. I can continue to list the names of many respectable people who have signed the Stockholm Appeal. These people have a high status in their countries and enjoy the trust of their people. I emphasize this in order to refute this propaganda that slanders the Stockholm Appeal and slanders all the efforts of hundreds of millions of people of all countries and nations, who are resolutely and selflessly fighting the war-mongers for peace, for friendship among countries, and for international cooperation.

You must remember the appeal of the International Committee of the Red Cross to the countries that have signed the Geneva Convention. This appeal was issued on April 5, 1950. It calls for an agreement on banning atomic weapons and weapons of general automatic control. The appeal said that the International Committee of the Red Cross must assist in resolving the above-mentioned issues for purely humanitarian reasons. The International Red Cross recalled the resolution passed at the 17th International Red Cross Conference—I want to apologize to the Swedish representative, because this resolution was also passed in Stockholm in 1948. The resolution is as follows: "The 17th International Red Cross Conference, in view of the fact that the belligerent countries in World War II observed the rules on banning suffocating gas, poison gas and similar gases, and bacteriological warfare weapons—this rule was formally approved by the Geneva Protocol of June 17, 1925; in view of the fact that the use of such automatically controlled weapons, that is, weapons that cannot be accurately aimed, or weapons that cause destruction in a wide space without a specific target, means destroying humanity and precious cultural relics that the Red Cross has a responsibility to protect, and will endanger the future of civilization—specially requests all countries to solemnly guarantee to completely prohibit the use of such weapons and the use of atomic energy or any other similar weapons for military purposes".

"Requests all countries"—that's what the International Red Cross said. This was not said by the so-called Moscow propagandists, this was said by the International Red Cross....

Here at this meeting, as I have already said, some people dare to slander the peace fighters and slander them as fifth columnists. And the peace fighters are precisely the true patriots, who cannot be scared by slander and retaliation, just as people cannot stop this powerful movement in all countries. This movement is the main obstacle to the aggressive plans to prepare and launch another war, and this movement is so powerful because it embodies the hopes and aspirations of all countries in the world!

Hundreds of Millions of People Around the World Firmly Support Peace
A Warning to the Warmongers That Cannot Be Ignored
Speaking of this, one cannot help but point out the indecent behavior of the British government in trying to undermine the Second World Peace Congress. The British government under Attlee took police measures to obstruct the holding of the congress in Sheffield. It obstructed the holding of the congress in Sheffield, but the congress was inaugurated in Warsaw on November 16.

Since I am speaking on this issue here, I would like to take this opportunity, and from this rostrum, on behalf of my delegation, and I think also on behalf of many other delegations, to extend warm greetings to the Second World Peace Congress in Warsaw, and I hope—that the congress will be victorious in the lofty struggle to fight for peace against the warmongers (loud applause from the seats of several delegations).

Naturally, the warmongers panicked and took all measures to undermine this movement. However, there are far more peace fighters than warmongers.

In the Soviet Union, there are 115 million people—the entire adult population—who have signed the Stockholm Appeal. In China—there are 204 million people, in Poland, in Czechoslovakia, in Bulgaria, in Romania, in Hungary, in Albania—there are more than 50 million people. In Japan, in Korea, in Britain, in Argentina, in many other countries—there are 50 million people, in Germany—there are more than 20 million people. In France, 15 million people have signed the Appeal, and in Italy—16 million people.

Even in the United States of America, although the government used strict police measures to deal with the peace movement, there are still 2.5 million Americans who have signed the Stockholm Appeal.

We salute them!—This is a serious force. This is a warning to the warmongers that cannot be ignored.

The Stockholm Appeal not only calls for the unconditional prohibition of atomic weapons, but also calls for any government that first uses atomic weapons to be regarded as a government that has committed war crimes. It is very clear that the Stockholm Appeal is not liked by the candidates for war criminals....

As I have already said, in general, the memorandum puts aside the issue of the unconditional prohibition of atomic weapons. Therefore, the Soviet delegation believes that it is necessary to stipulate this in this plan, and to require the establishment of control over atomic energy. The control must be strict, the control must be effective, and the control must be implemented by a real international control agency, and not by a group of American officials as stipulated in the notorious Acheson-Baruch-Lilienthal plan. A plan to achieve peace that does not stipulate the unconditional prohibition of atomic weapons cannot be regarded as the starting point for the cause of consolidating peace and international security.

The memorandum has a section discussing the issue of troops that must be placed at the disposal of the Security Council in accordance with Article 43 of the Charter. This section does not address the important issue of the principle of equality in the number and type of troops provided to the Security Council by the permanent members. However, this issue is very important, because applying the principle of equality will definitely not allow any permanent member of the Security Council to use the troops placed at the disposal of the Security Council for its own purposes rather than for common purposes.

In putting forward this suggestion, the memorandum does not say a word about the content of the differences of opinion among countries on the issue of establishing United Nations troops. The fundamental difference of opinion on this issue lies in the fact that some countries are attempting to force upon the United Nations the principle that the permanent members of the United Nations should not participate in the troops placed at the disposal of the Security Council equally in quantity and quality, and that the troops sent by the permanent members of the Security Council should not be equal in number and type.

The Soviet Union adheres to the policy of strictly and accurately implementing all the provisions of the United Nations Charter, especially Article 43, which stipulates that quality and quantity must be equal in all matters involving the number and type of troops sent by the permanent members of the Security Council.

The United States and Britain oppose the principle that the troops supplied to the Security Council by the permanent members of the Security Council should be equal in the quality and quantity of their composition. The United States and Britain reject this principle of equality in an attempt to obtain a unique dominance for themselves in the troops established in accordance with Article 43, in order to use these troops for the purposes of their bloc, rather than for common purposes, for the purpose of implementing the principles stipulated in the United Nations Charter.

The Soviet delegation believes that this principle is very important and advocates that this principle must become the basis for governments of all countries to send troops for the disposal of the Security Council.

The reason why the memorandum does not say a word about this issue is that mentioning this would violate the goals of the United States and its allies—Britain, France, and other members of the Atlantic Treaty. The memorandum does not want to violate the meaning of this powerful group of countries. On the contrary, the memorandum is an expression of their views. The drafter of the memorandum is the "spokesperson" and mouthpiece of the United States, Britain, France, and the entire North Atlantic Alliance. This memorandum with such defects would be very suitable for the North Atlantic Alliance, but it is not suitable for the United Nations.

Assisting Backward Countries Cannot Hinder National Interests. The US Fourth Point Plan is Actually an Expansion Plan
The memorandum talks about the necessity of implementing a broad plan to provide technical assistance to economically backward countries. This issue is very important in the activities of the United Nations organization. This is why it deserves attention. It affects the interests of many countries.

Everyone knows that the various agencies of the United Nations—the General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council—have considered this issue more than once. Everyone knows that the Ninth Session of the Economic and Social Council formulated an expanded plan for technically assisting the economic development of backward countries. The Soviet Union supports the suggestion that this plan must be implemented. We have participated in formulating a plan for providing technical assistance through the United Nations. We believe that technical assistance must be carried out in such a way that foreign monopolies cannot use it to make the economies of these backward countries subordinate to their own interests, and to hinder the national interests of these backward countries—they are backward mainly due to the faults of these imperialists, these so-called strong countries, whose policies are policies that hinder and prevent the development of the entire industry and economy, as well as the culture, of these backward countries.

At present, American monopoly capitalists are using technical assistance as a method of invading the economies of backward countries, a method of enslaving these countries. The so-called Fourth Point Plan of US President Truman is nothing more than a plan for American expansion of colonies.

Everyone knows that during World War II and after World War II, the economic aggression of American monopolies against economically backward countries has become increasingly intensified, which has been greatly helped by the so-called Marshall Plan.

The Secretary-General's memorandum essentially follows this plan of the American monopoly capitalists. The memorandum suggests that the technical assistance plan should be implemented mainly through the United Nations, but not entirely through the United Nations. This makes it possible for American monopolies to use the United Nations to achieve their own interests to the detriment of the interests of economically backward countries. This also shows the memorandum's one-sided pro-American nature. It is unacceptable from the point of view of the interests of the people of these backward countries, and from the point of view of all those who are willing to follow the path established by our Charter. The path established by the Charter is to assist these countries to develop towards national self-determination and independence. This independence is not only political but also economic, which is the foundation of any real independence, because if a country is economically subject to another country, it cannot talk about independence politically.

The Soviet delegation believes that the plan for technical assistance to backward countries must be implemented under the principle of not violating the interests of the economically backward countries, and that these interests should be taken care of. In this regard, it must be ensured that this technical assistance is implemented entirely through the United Nations, and not through those organizations of monopoly capitalists, companies of monopoly capitalists that determine the entire policy direction. Only in extremely unavoidable circumstances can people agree to have most of these issues handled through the United Nations.

Therefore, the Soviet delegation believes that the technical assistance plan must promote the development of these countries' domestic resources, develop their national industries and agriculture, consolidate their economic independence, and must never be attached with the requirement that the countries providing assistance obtain political, economic, or military privileges.

In fact, there is a practice in several countries when giving so-called assistance—especially under the Marshall Plan and the Truman Plan—that this "assistance" is bought at the cost of very important privileges to the country giving the "assistance", and obtaining this "assistance" is to the detriment of the important interests of these so-called backward countries and nations.

Lie is Silent on US-British Discrimination Against Foreign Trade
The Soviet Union Advocates That International Trade Should Be Equal and Mutually Beneficial
The memorandum raises the issue of expanding the membership of the United Nations specialized agencies, while at the same time remaining silent on the important issue of international cooperation related to the International Trade Organization, such as the issue of discrimination against foreign trade. Everyone knows that some countries, especially the United States and Britain, are practicing this discrimination against other countries on an increasingly large scale.

It is very obvious that the policy of discrimination against foreign trade is not in line with the principles and purposes of the United Nations. This policy hinders the establishment of normal economic relations between countries, it is not in line with the interests of the countries, and it violates the basic task of promoting and strengthening international relations.

The Soviet delegation believes that international trade should conform to the national interests of the trading countries and should be economically beneficial to them. Therefore, we are in favor of developing international trade as much as possible based on the normal conditions of international economic cooperation, and based on the principle of appropriately respecting the national interests of these countries.

The Soviet Union has consistently pursued a policy of strengthening and expanding trade and economic relations with all countries that are willing to trade with the Soviet Union.

The Soviet Union's foreign trade policy and its mutual economic relations with other countries are based on the truly democratic principles of equality between the two trading parties and respect for mutual interests.

Starting from these principles, the Soviet government has paid great attention to the suggestions of the Executive Secretary of the Economic Commission for Europe, which aimed to expand trade between Western European and Eastern European countries. The Soviet government has announced that it is willing to fully support the development of international trade on the condition of guaranteeing the mutual interests of the countries concerned.

The Soviet government highly agrees with the suggestion made by the Executive Secretary of the Economic Commission for Europe to conclude a European grain agreement. And everyone knows that the meeting to formulate a European grain agreement, with the participation of the Soviet Union, Britain, Denmark, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, and Sweden, was inaugurated in Geneva on November 14.

However, the policy of discrimination against foreign trade is still being implemented, and I must say that the scale of its implementation is increasing, especially in the United States and Britain.

The Soviet delegation certainly cannot remain silent on this shameful fact, because in a civilized society, every kind of discrimination—racial, national, religious, economic—is intolerable. Discrimination in trade undermines the possibility of expanding trade relations, and everyone knows that trade and commercial relations provide the best soil for the tree of peace to grow and blossom. We believe that the issue of stopping discriminatory measures in foreign trade must be reflected in the plan to seek peace. But the plan does not talk about this at all, which is one of the main shortcomings of this plan.

When several countries—member states of the United Nations—are implementing discriminatory policies in their trade relations with other countries, it is not possible to seriously treat the formulation of a plan to seek peace.

The Soviet delegation believes that economically, politically, and militarily stronger countries developing international trade without discrimination on the basis of equality, respect for the sovereignty of all countries, and non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries is a sound foundation for developing international cooperation. This is why the plan to strengthen peace must stipulate that discriminatory policies and discriminatory actions in foreign trade cannot be tolerated and should be terminated.

The Soviet delegation believes that this plan must contain provisions aimed at promoting international trade to the fullest extent.

As for the ratification of the charter of the International Trade Organization, the Soviet delegation believes that the Soviet delegation may sign the charter if the charter is amended. The current charter of the International Trade Organization violates the vital economic interests of many countries and is not satisfactory.

The Soviet Union Agrees to Formulate a Twenty-Year Peace Plan
But Advocates Making Necessary Amendments to the Lie Memorandum
The above examples show that the Secretary-General's memorandum, as I have already said, is a one-sided document that only represents the views of some powerful countries on important issues. The memorandum has not made any effort to reconcile different views and to lay a foundation for formulating a consistent policy to eliminate differences. However, this requirement should be the main

　　关于赖伊所提谋取和平的二十年方案问题
    维辛斯基在联大全体会上演说全文
    【新华社讯】塔斯社纽约二十一日电：苏联代表团团长维辛斯基十一月十八日在联合国大会全体会议上发表演说。全文如下：
    我们就要开始讨论《拟定经由联合国谋取和平的二十年方案》的问题。苏联愿意支持联合国内外一切为了保持和加强国际和平与各民族安全的措施，只要这些措施是真正为了达到这些目的的。
            苏联人民主张两个制度和平共存  苏联政府屡次提出加强和平建议
    苏维埃国家自成立以来一直就坚持不渝，始终如一地实施和平与国际合作的政策。苏联在将这个政策付诸实施的时候，是从这个前提出发的，这就是：两个制度——社会主义制度与资本主义制度——的共存是可能的。乌·伊·列宁与约·维·斯大林这两位苏联人民的领袖曾经屡次申明：这两个制度能够共存。苏联人民坚决主张这两个制度的和平共存，因为他们像其他各国人民一样是要巩固和平的。
    苏联是在实施和平政策的，因而要求采取保证国际和平的措施。苏维埃政府自标志历史新纪元肇始的伟大十月社会主义革命以来，从第一天起就一直在实施这个政策。苏维埃国家的对外政策灌注着一个思想，就是在与其他国家相互关系上和在苏联参加的国际组织中为和平、为国际合作而奋斗。
    因此，苏联政府曾屡次提出关于加强和平与安全的提案请联合国审议。这些建议是大会的代表们大家都知道的。
    这些建议包括：缔结无条件禁止原子武器和建立严格国际管制以监督这个禁令之实现的国际公约的建议；裁减军备和军队的建议；采取措施反对新战争宣传和新战争挑拨者；禁止原子武器并将安全理事会五个常任理事国的军备和军队裁减三分之一，这五个大国缔结加强和平公约。
    如所周知，这些建议中有几项建议构成了大会所通过的建议的基础。在本届大会中，苏联政府为了同样崇高的目的——加强和平及保证各国的安全——，提出了制止新战争威胁、巩固世界和平与安全的宣言草案，以及关于侵略定义的提案和若干其他提案。
    在目前，当若干国家中的侵略力量正在抬头并采取实际步骤来发动新战争的时候，当这些力量正在准备侵略办法并想以原子武器攻击其他国家和平居民的时候，当朝鲜已经有了对朝鲜人民的直接侵略，而朝鲜人民为争取他们的独立及反对外国侵犯而英勇作战的时候——在这样一个时候，制定经由联合国（正如斯大林大元帅所指出，联合国是保持和平及国际安全的重要工具）获致持久和平的计划，以便尽一切力量制止侵略及保证各国——大国和小国——间的和平合作，是特别重要和必要的。
    苏联代表团认为大会应该考虑到各国人民争取和平的坚决意志，这些人民已在斯德哥尔摩宣言上签上了数万万的名字，从而表示他们决心要加强和平与制止新战争的威胁。
    苏联代表团充分相信，大会的责任是：采取措施制止新战争宣传、禁止侵略和大规模毁灭人类的武器——原子武器并且禁止其他大规模毁灭人类的工具；采取措施在一九五○——一九五一年中裁减五大国军备和军队三分之一，并将在大会下届会议上提出进一步裁减军队的问题——我们在我们的宣言草案中正是这样建议的，不幸的是，这个宣言草案竟为大会所否决；最后，采取措施缔结五大国加强和平的公约，这个公约能够灌注一种信念，就是五大国都在朝着这个伟大目标努力而且这将是加强国际信任的一个步骤。
    虽然大会否决了苏联的各项建议，特别是要求采纳关于制止新战争威胁，巩固世界和平与安全的宣言的建议，然而苏联今后仍将继续为实现这些目标而奋斗，并且将尽一切努力使这些目标尽可能迅速地和充分地达到。
    苏联宣言草案中所指出的任务现在仍在大会议程上有待讨论，尤其是因为还有一个拟订保证国际和平的长期方案的问题。我们必须自始就说明，如果这种方案忽略了诸如停止新战争宣传，无条件禁止原子武器和建立有效国际管制以监督这个禁令的实现，诸如裁减军备、特别是大国的军备，解决大国间的分歧并且由它们签订公约以加强和平等等的任务，它就是毫无任何意义与思想的空谈。不努力履行这些任务，要拟定任何经由联合国谋取和平的方案是不能认真设想的。
    秘书长在其昨天的演说中谈到朝鲜境内的侵略时，硬说侵略是来自北朝鲜。他重申美英集团的代表们在这里说过的话，他们把朝鲜军事事件的责任从有罪者的身上转嫁与无辜者。
    秘书长的声明是与事情的真相矛盾的。我们在政治委员会上和这里大会上曾经不只一次地提出并列举许多文件和证据，确证美国侵略朝鲜的事实。没有人尝试反驳这些文件，而且也没有人能够反驳。
    更有进者，攻讦者甚至拒绝在政治委员会和大会中听取人民民主的北朝鲜政府代表发表意见，显然是害怕朝鲜人民代表的证据会再次证明侵略来自北朝鲜的说法难以成立。在这方面，指出这一点是很有兴趣的：根据美联社汉城十一月三日电讯，南朝鲜国民议会的大批代表曾提出请愿书，认为人所共知的美国统治集团的仆从李承晚政府应对战争和朝鲜因而遭受的破坏负责。美国的垄断资本家应对朝鲜战争负责，是越发明显了。
    朝鲜事件加强了各国人民阻止进一步侵略、保持和平与安全的意志。和平运动已经壮大，这个运动是我们应该以各种可能的方法去支持的，因为它符合于一切爱好和平人民的基本利益。
    有关全世界利益的重要国际问题没有中国参加联合国就不能决定
    苏联政府在提出加强和平与国际安全的建议时，过去总是表示而且现在也表示愿意考虑旨在达成同一目的的任何建议。所以苏联政府对于要联合国拟定二十年和平方案的建议抱着积极的态度。苏联政府同意备忘录中所说的，经由联合国可以有效地采取措施以停止所谓冷战，并有助于加强和平。
    目前有这样一些重要问题，如果这些问题没有得到解决就不可能实行任何真正的经由联合国谋取和平的方案。这些问题中有中国在联合国的代表权问题、无条件禁止原子武器和国际管制问题、限制并裁减各种军备和军队问题、以及我已经谈到的其他若干问题。
    让我们来看看备忘录中是怎样提出这些问题的，它是怎样建议加以解决的。
    苏联同意备忘录中的这一声明，即：除非中国在联合国中的合作问题得到解决，否则在加强和平的这一事业上是不可能达到任何共同的进展的。苏联政府准备——它从本届会议开幕迄今以及在以前都已在事实上证明了这一点——支持备忘录中的若干建议，例如以第四届联大所决定的指示为基础重新进行关于原子能问题的谈判，例如缔结关于限制并裁减各种军备的协定等等。
    但是同时苏联代表团认为必须指出备忘录所提方案的本质的缺点。首先，备忘录是片面性的。例如，备忘录提出了关于依照宪章第二十八条召开安理会定期会议的重要问题。像备忘录所指出的，安理会的定期会议应当是由高级人员用来对联合国未决问题作一般的考虑，尤其是对于那些在安理会常任理事国、即所谓大国之间发生严重分歧的问题。
    我曾经指出过，召开安理会定期会议的建议是根据宪章第二十八条，该条规定：在这些会议上“每一理事国认为合宜时得派政府大员或其他特别拟定之代表出席”。但是备忘录却丝毫没有谈到像中国在安理会的代表权这样重要的问题。苏联代表团认为这是错误的。我们支持召开安理会定期会议的建议。我们知道：我们为了努力达到和平，就不可忽略联合国宪章提供的任何可能性，并且，为了免除新战争的威胁就必须努力保证各民族间的持久与巩固的和平。我们有这样的信念，召集安理会定期会议，无疑会有助于使安理会在解决问题上的工作活跃起来；这工作是联合国宪章责成安理会负责的任务，而且根据这种任务，正是安理会对维持和平负主要的责任。像中国在安理会的代表权这样重要的问题，备忘录中竟只字未提，这说明备忘录的作者是在附和那些不愿求得国际巩固持久和平的政府所持的立场。
    备忘录丝毫没有提到这个问题，也证明备忘录的作者不愿保证联合国组织中进行合作的首要条件——承认中国人民有无可争辩的权利派它所授权的代表来此间，并把那些骗子逐出我们的组织，这些骗子绝不代表中国人民，只是代表那已为伟大的中国人民的英勇的手所抛入历史垃圾堆中的、腐烂透顶的国民党集团。
    苏联代表团认为：安理会定期会议应在为其人民所承认而且在该国家行使真正权力的合法政府为代表的全体理事国参加之下举行。不论任何理由，尤其是谬误的和无稽的理由，都不能阻止在安理会有代表权的政府参加安理会的工作，及联合国其他机构的工作，像目前阻止中华人民共和国政府那样。
    国民党集团被赶出本国，躲藏在美国军队保护下的台湾。他们的代表们参加联合国组织各机构的工作以及参加安理会定期会议的工作（如果会议现在就开始的话），是不能认为合法的。
    苏联代表团认为，为了实施宪章中关于召开安理会定期会议这种重要规定，首先必须解决中国代表权的问题，所以谋取和平方案规定安理会应在全体理事国出席及中华人民共和国代表参加下执行职务。通过这种建议就可以创立使安理会工作有效的真正基础，因为任何一个影响全世界利益的重要国际问题，要是没有大国之一的代表们——四亿七千五百万中国人民的、中华人民共和国的代表们参加，在联合国就不能够决定，那是当然的事情。
    赖伊备忘录竟图限制大国一致原则
    证明了他是美英统治集团的传声筒
    备忘录建议重新努力谋取大国间关于限制安理会工作中大国一致原则之应用的协议。这是绝对不能接受的建议。
    仅仅这一桩事实不就已足可使人相信我刚才所说的备忘录的政治片面性了吗？
    仅仅这一桩事实，难道还不足以令我们相信这个备忘录实质上是美国统治集团的传声筒——美英集团的传声筒吗？难道这个建议不是与联合国宪章背道而驰，不是抛弃了我们这个组织的一个重要的基本原则吗？
    这一类的建议我们已不只听到一次了，提出这种建议的正是那个集团的代表们。这个集团即使还不想要消灭否决权的原则，（其所以不消灭它，如美国代表杜勒斯所说，是因为它可能有一天会对美国自己方便）至少也在千方百计地限制它的使用，以便使它在目前的情况下，在目前这个时候不致妨碍美英集团完成它的侵略与扩张主义措施的计划，他们正在有系统地把这些侵略与扩张的措施强行在联合国各种机构中，甚至强行在大会中通过。有人说通过限制否决权的使用的建议可以为使安理会的工作有效这一目的创造真正的基础。但是以这样的理由来辩解这个建议显然是牵强附会。实质上，这个建议就是攻击联合国宪章中所规定的我们这个组织的基本原则。
    必须强调指出：提出这样一个问题不仅不能促进世界和平事业——或者说巩固联合国——而且相反地，它是以破坏联合国为目的的。自然，这正是那些在策划和准备着并且已在实施着他们的扩张主义计划的人们所要求的，他们的扩张主义计划有一个目的，那就是取得世界霸权。
    通过联合国获致和平的方案是不能建立在违犯宪章最重要的原则和规定之上的。
    这种方案应该建筑在严格地并绝对地遵守宪章的基础之上。
    不幸，尤其是最近，违犯宪章在联合国已成为司空见惯的事情。我们可以从许多例子里看到这一点。我不愿在这一点上多费唇舌，免得耗费了你们的时间。只要回忆一下这里最近通过的关于延长秘书长任期的决定就足以说明一切了；这个秘书长就是讨论中的备忘录的作者，他至今还不懂得尊重宪章，但是作为一个秘书长，他应该是维护宪章的人。
    基于上述理由，苏联代表团认为关于限制使用大国一致原则的建议是不正确的，而且是无法接受的。
    关于无条件禁止原子武器的协定赖伊方案故意含糊其辞掩饰侵略
    在备忘录中有关于建立原子能管制的建议。在讨论各种建议时，我们早已对这个问题发表过意见，主要是在讨论苏联所提的关于《制止新战争威胁、巩固世界和平与安全的宣言》草案时，以及在第一委员会讨论八国提案时；后来这个八国提案竟以第一委员会的名义在”以行动谋和平“这种冠冕堂皇的题目下提交全会了！
    我们看到这个提案中的同一个建议竟在秘书长的备忘录中一再地提出。这个建议也是无法接受的，因为它仅限于要求建立国际管制，而不同时禁止原子武器。为了欺骗舆论，它并装模作样地要求对禁止原子武器予以管制。
    但是现在还没有禁止原子武器！有人竟叫我们去管制不存在的东西。他们想用空洞的和虚伪的关于国际管制的词句，来掩饰他们对于禁止原子武器所采取的消极的态度，来保持继续制造原子武器的可能性。
    这种烟幕老早就被揭穿了，但是在备忘录中这种烟幕又重被利用。备忘录说到管制原子能而对禁止原子能用于军事用途一事，却一字不提。
    应当说到那一方面的管制呢？我们所说的管制的意义是：原子能只应当用于和平的用途，应当禁止把它用于军事用途。因此，原子武器的制造必须禁止。
    但这正是备忘录中所没有说到的，也正是美英集团、侵略性的北大西洋公约国家的代表的任何一篇演说中所没有说到的。
    备忘录重复陈述美英集团的公式，这是它的政治上的片面性和它的亲美性质的另一证明。
    大会里有人说，赖伊曾带着他的备忘录到莫斯科去。不，他到莫斯科时带的是已经被美国国务院批准的、已经得到伦敦的外交部和巴黎的外交部同意的、也就是已经得到整个反和平阴谋家伙帮的同意的备忘录。并且只是在那时这个备忘录才在莫斯科在我们眼前出现。
    我们认为，单单是备忘录丝毫没有说到禁止原子武器这种情形，就破坏了人们对这个备忘录的信任。这种情况表明：这个备忘录如不按照我在这里所说的精神加以相应的修正，任何真正努力争取和平的人是不能加以支持的。
    苏联代表团相信——而且它已经屡次充分明确地表明了它的态度——原子能领域中的发明已经为一切爱好和平的人民与国家确定了一个任务，这就是缔结无条件禁止原子武器与设立严格国际管制的国际协定。可是，我已说过，这个备忘录却对此默不作声，而使用了含糊其辞的空洞的虚伪的辞句。这些辞句，我们已经听过许多次，不幸竟又为前几天第一委员会的多数所通过的名为“以行动谋和平”的决议案中所采用。
    但是，我们应该明白：如果不禁止原子武器并不同时建立有效管制，监督这种禁令的执行，那么就不能拯救人类免于由于在未来战争中使用原子武器以及其他大规模毁灭人类的主要武器而招致的一切浩劫的威胁。
    秘书长的备忘录所提出的问题并没有为联合国加强国际和平与安全的努力指示正确的方向。相反的，它仅仅致力于掩饰的目的，这些目的和加强和平的崇高目的是毫无相同之处的。对原子能问题作这样的提法，实际上无非是要掩饰无限制地继续制造原子武器。
    每个人都该看到：不禁止原子武器，就不能拯救人类免于把原子能用于军事用途的威胁。
    因此苏联代表团认为这个方案——如果这不是虚伪的方案而是真正以加强和平为目的的方案——就必须规定无条件禁止原子武器。
    这应该是这个方案关于和平问题的出发点，因为不接受这个条件，就不能有和平。但这点他们是不想做的，因为他们并不要真正加强和平。
    无数代表人物在和平宣言上签名反动派的诽谤决吓不倒和平战士
    这说明了为什么斯德哥尔摩宣言遇到了某些人士而且遇到——我遗憾的说——大会人士的狂怒。一个人只要想一想政治委员会会议的情形就行了，会上斯德哥尔摩宣言受到狂乱谩骂的攻击，宣言的拥护者被称为“第五纵队”，那些在宣言上签名的人，那些全世界五万万正直的人民，被称为卖国贼徒，关于这些人，我昨天已经简短地谈到，今天我愿意更详细地说一说。
    的确，某些人竟说斯德哥尔摩宣言是“阴谋”，是“诡计”，是最大的骗局。瑞典代表甚至在政治委员会上表示抱歉，因为斯德哥尔摩的名字和这个宣言联系起来使用了。或许他还要在这里道歉呢。为的什么？因为斯德哥尔摩把它的名字给予了数万万正直人民参加的最巨大的人民运动，和平运动。瑞典代表显然忽略了，他作这种道歉，只能败坏了他的代表团和他本人的名声。我们已经说过，已经在斯德哥尔摩宣言上签过名的人们包括成千成万的著名的政治领袖，以及科学、艺术、文学和各种宗教、文化界的代表人物。
    我很愿意追述一下西欧和其他国家曾经在斯德哥尔摩宣言上签过名的若干政治和公众领袖的名字：英国：著名政治领袖，前下院议员普里特与普拉茨——米尔斯；比利时：最高法院法官戴尔，范·登·布兰敦，德·李治男爵（前部长）；意大利：议员南尼（前部长），议员俄兰多（前总理），德·尼可拉（前总统），下议院议长格伦琦；法国：国民议会议员艾马纽尔，达斯蒂尔·德·拉·魏基利（前部长），国民议会议员哥德，国民议会议员大比埃（前部长），国民议会议员葛鲁埃牧师、里维与维美徐，上诉法院院长李昂——凯恩，检察总长毛耐尔；哥伦比亚：艾潜第亚博士（前共和国总统），瑞斯博士（前司法部长），参议员科多巴博士，高等仲裁法院院长布拉伏博士；巴西：巴西国会议员顾吉尔；挪威：洪司鲁德（前总理）；埃及：国务会议主席阿布德尔·拉萨克·厄尔·桑浩里，议员李瓦·爱托哈米德·法图将军；澳大利亚：参议员毛若、弗拉何第与王德；伊朗：众议院副议长毛塞密，议员福拉德文德、杜立亚特、梅迪·阿贝布与赛菲；黎巴嫩：黎巴嫩议会议员谢克·赛利姆·卡桑；墨西哥：多尔伯（前部长），卡德纳斯将军（前墨西哥共和国总统），内政部长加尔西亚；芬兰：总理吉科宁，农民联盟的议员鲁斯泰里宁威英诺·西莫宁、维罗莱宁、埃斯可拉、鲁英科、萨里与莱皮汉姆。我能够继续举出已在斯德哥尔摩宣言上签名的许多可敬的人们的名字。这些人们在他们国内有很高的地位，并享有他们人民的信任。我所以强调这一点是为了驳斥这种诽谤斯德哥尔摩宣言，诽谤各国各民族千百万人民的一切努力的宣传，这些人民正在为了和平、为了各国间的友谊、为了国际的合作而对战争贩子进行坚决的忘我的斗争。
    你们一定要记住红十字会国际委员会对于曾在日内瓦公约上签字的国家的呼吁书。这个呼吁书是在一九五○年四月五日发出的。它要求对禁用原子武器以及一般自动操纵武器获致协议。呼吁书中说红十字会国际委员会为了纯人道主义的理由必须协助解决上述问题。国际红十字会追述第十七届国际红十字会会议上通过的决议——我要向瑞典代表道歉，因为这个决议也是于一九四八年在斯德哥尔摩通过的。决议如下：“第十七届国际红十字会会议鉴于在二次世界大战中交战国遵守了关于禁用窒息瓦斯、毒瓦斯与类似瓦斯、以及细菌战武器的规则——这条规则由一九二五年六月十七日的日内瓦议定书正式批准；鉴于使用这种自动操纵武器，即无法正确瞄准的武器，或没有一定目标而在广大空间造成破坏的武器，意味着毁灭红十字会有责任保卫的人类及珍贵文物，并将危及文明的前途——特恳求各国庄严地保证完全禁止使用这种武器及使用原子能或任何其他类似武器于军事用途”。
    “恳求各国”——国际红十字会这样说。这不是所谓莫斯科宣传家说的，这是国际红十字会说的……。
    这里在这个会议上，像我已经说过的，有人竟敢诽谤和平战士并诬蔑他们是第五纵队。而和平战士恰正是真正的爱国者，他们不是诽谤和报复所能吓倒的，就像人们不能阻止各国的这个强大的运动一样。这个运动是实现准备和发动另一次战争的侵略计划的主要障碍，这个运动之所以非常强大，就是因为它体现了世界上一切国家的希望和愿望！
    世界各国的亿万人民坚决拥护和平
    对于战争贩子是个不可轻侮的警告
    说到这里，令人不禁要指出企图破坏第二届世界保卫和平大会的英国政府的不体面的行为。在艾德礼领导下的英国政府对这个大会采取警察措施来阻挠在设菲尔德举行大会。它阻挠了大会在设菲尔德举行，但大会却于十一月十六日在华沙揭幕了。
    既然我在这里就这个问题发言，我就希望利用这个机会，并且在这个讲坛上代表我国代表团，而且我想也可以代表许多其他的代表团，向华沙第二届世界保卫和平大会致热烈的敬礼，并且希望——大会在争取和平反对战争贩子的崇高斗争中无往不胜（若干代表团的席位上发出大声的鼓掌）。
    自然，战争贩子惊慌起来了，他们采取了一切措施来破坏这个运动。然而和平的战士比战争贩子的人数要多得多。
    在苏联，有一亿一千五百万人民——全部成年的人口——在斯德哥尔摩宣言上签了名。在中国——有二亿零四百万人，在皮兰，在捷克斯洛伐克，在保加利亚，在罗马尼亚，在匈牙利，在阿尔巴尼亚——有五千万人以上。在日本，在朝鲜，在英国，在阿根廷，在许多其他国家——有五千万人，在德国——有二千余万人。在法国，有一千五百万人在宣言上签了名，在意大利——有一千六百万人。
    即使在美利坚合众国，虽然政府使用了严厉的警察措施来对付和平运动，但仍有二百五十万美国人在斯德哥尔摩宣言上签了名。
    我们向他们致敬！——这是严重的力量。这对于战争贩子乃是一个不可轻侮的警告。
    斯德哥尔摩宣言不仅要求无条件禁止原子武器，并且要求把任何第一个使用原子武器的政府视为犯有战争罪行的政府。很清楚，斯德哥尔摩宣言不是战争罪犯候选人所喜欢的……。
    我已经说过，总的说来，备忘录撇开了无条件禁止原子武器问题。因此，苏联代表团认为有必要在这个方案中规定这一点，并要求建立对于原子能的管制。管制必须严格，管制必须有效，管制必须由真正的国际管制机构而不是照臭名昭彰的艾奇逊——巴鲁区——李连塞尔计划的规定由一群美国官吏来执行。没有规定无条件禁止原子武器的谋取和平的方案，就不能被认为是巩固和平和国际安全的事业的出发点。
    备忘录有一节论述依照宪章第四十三条必须交予安理会支配的军队问题。这一节并没有论及关于常任理事国派给安理会的军队在数目和种类上平等的原则这一重要问题。然而这个问题是非常重要的，因为应用平等的原则，就必定不许安理会任何常任理事国为了其本身目的而不是为了共同目的利用归安理会支配的军队。
    备忘录在提出这个建议时，竟一个字都没有提到各国间对于建立联合国军队问题的分歧意见的内容。关于这个问题的基本意见分歧在于某些国家企图把联合国常任理事国参加归安理会支配的军队在数量与质量上不平等，安理会常任理事国所派军队在数目和种类上不平等的原则强行加诸联合国。
    苏联紧守严格准确地执行联合国宪章所有条款、特别是第四十三条的方针，第四十三条规定，在所有涉及安理会常任理事国所派军队的数目与种类问题上，质量与数量必须平等。
    美国和英国反对安理会常任理事国供给安理会支配的军队在质与量的组成上平等的原则。美国和英国拒绝这个平等的原则，是企图为他们自己在按照第四十三条建立的军队中取得独一无二的统治地位，以便为它们集团的目的，而不是为共同的目的、为实行联合国宪章所规定的原则的目的来使用这些军队。
    苏联代表团认为这个原则是很重要的，并主张必须要使这个原则成为各国政府派军队供安理会支配的基础。
    备忘录之所以对于这个问题不置一词是由于提到这一点就会违反美国及其盟国——英国、法国、及大西洋公约的其他成员国——的目标。备忘录并不想违反这一有势力的国家集团的意思。相反的，备忘录却是它们的观点的表现。备忘录的起草人是美国、英国、法国、及整个北大西洋联盟的“代言人”和传声筒。这个有着这样的缺陷的备忘录会很适合于北大西洋联盟，但却并不适合于联合国。
    援助落后国家不能妨害民族利益美国第四点计划实际是扩张计划
    备忘录谈到实行给经济落后国家以技术援助的广泛计划的必要性。这个问题在联合国这种组织的活动中是非常重要的。这就是它值得注意的原因。它影响许多国家的利益。
    大家都知道，联合国各机构——大会和经社理事会曾不止一次地审议过这个问题。大家都知道，经社理事会第九届会议制定了扩大的以技术援助落后国家经济开发计划。苏联支持关于必需实施这个计划的建议。我们曾参加制定经由联合国进行技术援助的计划。我们认为技术援助必须按照这种办法来进行，俾使外国垄断企业不可能利用它而使这些落后国家的经济从属于他们自己的利益，并妨害这些落后国家的民族利益——它们落后主要是由于这些帝国主义、这些所谓强国的过失，这些所谓强国的政策是妨碍并阻止这些落后国家本国的整个工业和经济以及文化的发展的政策。
    在目前，美国垄断资本家正利用技术援助作为侵入落后国家经济的方法，奴役这些国家的方法。美国杜鲁门总统的所谓第四点计划，只不过是美国扩张殖民地的计划而已。
    大家知道，在二次大战时期及二次大战以后，美国垄断企业对经济上落后国家的经济侵略愈来愈加剧了，这在很大程度上是得到所谓马歇尔计划的帮助的。
    秘书长的备忘录本质上是遵循美国垄断资本家的这个方案的。备忘录建议仅仅是主要经由联合国、而不是完全经由联合国来实施技术援助计划。这就使美国垄断资本有可能利用联合国来达到它们自己的利益而损害经济落后的国家的利益。这也说明了备忘录的片面亲美性质。从这些落后国家人民利益的观点，从所有愿遵循我们宪章所确立的道路的人们的观点来看都是不能接受的。宪章所确立的道路乃是朝着民族自决与独立的方向协助这些国家发展。这种独立不但是政治上的并且是经济上的，这是任何真正独立的基础，因为一个国家如果在经济方面受制于另一个国家，他在政治方面是谈不上独立的。
    苏联代表团认为技术援助落后国家的计划必须在不违背经济落后国家的利益的原则下实施，而且，这些利益应该得到照顾。在这一方面，必须保证这种技术援助完全经由联合国而不是经由那些由垄断资本家的组织、垄断资本家的公司决定整个政策方针的国家来实施。只有在极不得已的情况下，人们才能同意把这种问题的大部分经由联合国来进行。
    因此，苏联代表团认为技术援助计划必须促进这些国家的国内资源的发展，发展它们的民族工业与农业，巩固它们的经济独立，并且绝不可附有由提供援助国家取得政治、经济或军事特权的要求。
    实际上，若干国家给与所谓援助——特别是在马歇尔计划和杜鲁门计划下——时有一个惯例，就是：这种“援助”是以很重要的特权为代价向给与“援助”的国家买来的，获得这种“援助”是要损害这些所谓落后国家与民族的重要利益的。
    赖伊对美英对外贸易歧视默不作声
    苏联则主张国际贸易应该平等互利
    备忘录提出了扩大联合国专门机构的会员资格的问题，而同时对于与国际贸易组织有关的国际合作这种重要问题，例如对外贸易的歧视问题，则默不作声，更大家都知道，某些国家特别是美、英两国正在愈来愈大的规模上对其它国家实行这种歧视。
    十分明显，对外贸易的歧视政策是不符合联合国的原则与宗旨的。这种政策阻碍各国间建立正常的经济关系，它不符合国家的利益，并且是和增进并加强国际关系的基本任务相违背的。
    苏联代表团认为：国际贸易应该符合各贸易国的国家利益并且应该在经济上对它们有利。因此，我们赞成根据国际经济合作的正常条件，根据适当尊重这些国家的国家权益的原则，尽量地发展国际贸易。
    苏联对于一切愿意与苏联贸易的国家始终如一地奉行着加强并扩大与它们的贸易以及经济关系的政策。
    苏联对外贸易政策及其与其它国家的相互经济关系，是以贸易双方平等和尊重相互利益的真正民主原则为基础的。
    从这些原则出发，苏联政府很关心地考虑了欧洲经济委员会执行秘书的建议，这个建议旨在扩大西欧与东欧各国间的贸易。苏联政府已宣布它愿意在保证有关国家相互利益的条件下全力支持国际贸易的发展。
    苏联政府极为赞同欧洲经济委员会执行秘书所提出的缔结欧洲谷物协定的建议。而且大家都知道、有苏联、英国、丹麦、法国、意大利、荷兰、挪威、和瑞典参加的制定欧洲谷物协定的会议已于十一月十四日在日内瓦揭幕了。
    但是，对外贸易中的歧视政策仍在实施中，而且我必须说，其实施的规模日益扩大，尤其是美国和英国。
    苏联代表团确实不能默然放过这种可耻的事实，因为在文明的社会中，每一种歧视——种族的、民族的、宗教的、经济的——都是不能容许的。贸易方面的歧视破坏了扩大贸易关系的可能性，而大家都知道，贸易和商业关系提供了和平之树能够生长开花的最好的土地。我们认为，停止对外贸易中的歧视措施的问题必须反映在谋取和平的方案中。但方案对这一点什么也未谈到，这是这个方案的主要缺点之一。
    当若干国家——联合国会员国——在对其他国家的贸易关系上实行歧视政策时，是不能够认真对待谋取和平方案之拟定的。
    苏联代表团相信，经济上、政治上和军事上较为强大的国家，在平等、尊重各国主权，不干涉其他国家内政的基础上毫无歧视地发展国际贸易是发展国际合作的健全基础。这就是为什么加强和平的方案必须规定不能容许并且应该终止对外贸易中的歧视政策和歧视行为的理由。
    苏联代表团相信，这个方案中必须载有旨在最充分地促进国际贸易的规定。
    至于国际贸易组织章程的批准，苏联代表团相信，如果章程得到修正的话，苏联代表团就可能签署该章程。现行国际贸易组织章程侵犯了许多国家的切身经济利益，并且是不能令人满意的。
    苏联同意拟定谋取二十年和平方案
    但主张对赖伊备忘录作必要的修正
    上述的例子显示：秘书长的备忘录，像我所已经说过的那样，是一个片面的文件，它在重要的问题上只代表日本一些国家的观点，尽管这些国家是有势力的国家。备忘录没有作任何努力来调和不同的观点，并为消除歧见，拟定一致的方针奠定基础。可是，这种要求却应该是任何巩固和平的方案的主要条件和主要先决条件。
    苏联代表团认为，必须修改备忘录。在修改时，本届大会所交换的意见应该予以考虑。苏联愿意在这个问题上给以一切协助。
    依照上述诸端，苏联代表团建议大会对这个问题采纳一项决议草案。
    由于最近大会的惯例是在表决时不公布苏联的文件，我希望亲自宣读这个文件，俾能一新代表们对这个问题的记忆。
    “在研究了联合国秘书长的备忘录以及‘拟定谋取和平二十年方案’之后，大会兹决议：
    （一）同意提出关于拟定谋取和平二十年方案的问题。
    （二）大会认为在进一步拟定这一方案时，必须把下列规定列入：甲、举行安全理事会定期会议，深知安全理事会应在有中华人民共和国代表参加，其组织成份充分及合法的情况下执行职务；乙、安全理事会在其工作中应恪守大国一致的原则；丙、无条件禁止原子武器和其他型式用于大规模毁灭的武器，同时建立管制以监督上述禁令的实现；丁、在拟定方案期间，应将规定安全理事会常任理事国依照宪章第四十三条供给安全理事会之军队数目与种类的协定，以及安全理事国会任理事国所派军队在数量与质量上平等的原则付诸实施。在安全理事会某一常任理事国愿意时，得以安全理事会的特别决定对上述原则变通办理；戊、对经济落后国家给予技术援助，即使不是完全经由联合国，至少也应在大多数场合经由联合国进行之。在这一方面，须从下列事实出发，即：这种援助必须用于发展经济落后国家的国内资源，和民族工业与农业，及加强其经济独立，不应附有条件而要求给那些提供援助的国家以政治、经济或军事的特权；己、在平等与尊重一切国家主权、不干涉其他国家内政的基础上毫无歧视地发展国际贸易。”
    苏联提案的内容就是这样。
    苏联代表团建议通过这个提案作为进一步拟定谋取和平二十年方案的基础。有人可能要作这样的强辩：例如，大会打算把这个备忘录提交联合国各机构作进一步的拟定，因而也打算把这个备忘录提交给其若干部分可以提交给它作进一步拟定的安理会。所以大会无权对安理会作这样的指示。我们认为，这种论据完全是不攻自破的，因为问题不是向安理会发布指示，而是表示大会对于在拟定谋取和平方案中的指导原则应是什么这一问题的意见而已。接受或者拒绝大会的这项意见是要由安理会去决定的。而如果我们不愿意这个备忘录成为一张废纸，不愿意它仅仅企图制造幻想，蒙蔽舆论，说什么秘书长交给我们的备忘录无需事先认真修改，就能够以它为基础，真正加强和平，那么，表示我们的意见便是我们的责任。
    至于海地、加拿大与其他国家所提的九国提案，苏联代表团认为那是绝对不能接受的。我们相信：大会必须对于备忘录中所提问题的本质申述其意见，它必须为进一步拟定谋取和平二十年方案提供必要的方针。
    而九国提案甚至想也没有想要去达到这个目的。
    九国提案是空洞的文件，什么意义也没有，只是想迷惑联合国的舆论。它的目的是要转移各国对于保持和平的斗争的注意力，是要转移各国对于大国缔结公约加强和平的注意力以及对于五强裁减军备和确定裁减军备时限的问题的注意力。
    九国提案对于禁止原子武器问题也是支吾其词地蒙混过去，并且在这方面还使大会倒退，因为大会早在一九四六年就通过了必需禁止原子武器的决议了。
    由于这些理由，苏联代表团反对九国提案并将投票反对这个提案。苏联代表团认为大会必须通过这样的决议，即是对拟定经由联合国谋取和平二十年方案的进一步工作给以确定方针。
    苏联代表团提出了它自己的提案，这个提案我刚才已经宣读过了，我们深信这个提案是完全符合这些需要的。因此，我们敦促凡是真正想要联合国拟定一个有效的谋取和平方案的代表团都来支持苏联代表团所提出的提案。
