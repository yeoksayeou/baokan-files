　　Tanggu Dredging Dagukou Channel Personnel Pledge to Complete Annual Task One Month Early, Intensify Production to Support Volunteer Army

　　[This Newspaper News] This newspaper correspondent and agricultural model worker Zhang Shuhe reports: Workers on various ships dredging the Dagukou Channel at the Tanggu Haihe Engineering Office deeply resent the U.S. imperialists' acts of aggression and have expressed their determination to support our volunteer army and the Korean people with practical actions. Huang Min, the 61-year-old chief engineer, said: "Don't look at me being old and having blurred vision, even if I go to the front line to feed the horses, I can still contribute to the country!" The young comrades said: "We will make some wooden guns, practice with them first, and when the time comes, we will put down our machines, pick up our guns, and go fight the U.S. imperialists together with the Korean people." Thirty-eight comrades have requested to go to Korea to directly kill the enemy. All the staff have also formulated a patriotic production plan: to guarantee the completion of the 1950 work tasks by the end of November. They will also strengthen conservation, such as the Kuai Li ship saving 0.8 tons of coal and one jin of engine oil per day, and the Jun Li ship saving 0.5 tons of coal per day. At the same time, in order to ensure close cooperation between the work vessels, they have also established a contact contract. Recently, they are conducting air defense, fire protection, and rescue exercises.

    提前一月完成全年任务加紧生产支援志愿部队
    【本报讯】本报通讯员、农业劳模张树和报道：塘沽海河工程处疏浚大沽口航道各船工作人员痛恨美帝侵略暴行，纷纷表示要以实际行动支援我志愿部队及朝鲜人民。年高六十一岁的黄敏轮机长说：“别看我年纪老，眼花，到时候上前线去喂马也可以为国家出力！”年青的同志们说：“我们要作几支木枪，先操练熟了，到时候放下机器，拿起枪杆，就去和朝鲜人民一块打美帝。”有三十八名同志要求到朝鲜去直接杀敌人。全体工作人员并订出了爱国生产计划：保证十一月底完成一九五○年工作任务。并加强节约，如快利船每天要省煤零点八吨、机油一斤，浚利船每天要省煤零点五吨。同时为了使工作船只密切配合，又订立了联系合同。最近正进行防空、消防、救护等演习。
