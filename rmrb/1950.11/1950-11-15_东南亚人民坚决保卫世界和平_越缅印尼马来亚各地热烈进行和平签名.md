　　Southeast Asian People Resolutely Defend World Peace
　　Vietnamese, Burmese, Indonesian and Malayan People Enthusiastically Sign for Peace
　　[Xinhua News Agency, 14th] In recent months, the people of Southeast Asian countries have enthusiastically launched a movement to defend world peace. In many cities and villages of many countries, the broad masses of the people have held gatherings to support the Stockholm Appeal and have enthusiastically carried out signature campaigns. In other regions, despite the suppression by imperialist colonialists, the masses have still carried out unyielding struggles!
　　In Vietnam, the peace signature movement has been launched like a raging fire among the broad masses of the people. According to a report from the TASS correspondent, as of the end of October, the number of signatures totaled 3,871,298. All 1,800 staff members of the agencies directly under the Central Committee of the Viet Minh Front signed the peace declaration. The peace signature movement in Vietnam has penetrated into the ethnic minorities of the northern highlands. In early September, at a mass meeting of an ethnic minority in Lang Son province, 7,000 people signed the peace declaration, including 1,700 from the French-occupied areas. In Hoa Binh province, 60,000 ethnic minority people signed through their representatives. In the port city of Haiphong in central Vietnam, occupied by the French army, 29,000 citizens signed the peace declaration despite the suppression by the French military police.
　　In Burma, the Burmese branch of the World Peace Congress launched a peace signature campaign in mid-June, planning to collect 2 million signatures. In three months, more than 3 million signatures were collected, far exceeding the original target.
　　In Indonesia, after the Indonesian branch of the World Peace Congress was established in Yogyakarta in July, the signature campaign immediately unfolded throughout Indonesia. Branches were established in Jakarta, Bandung, Cirebon, Semarang, Solo, Surabaya, Medan, and other places. In Belitung alone, 4,967 people have signed, accounting for about one-fifth of the local population. In Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia, the Overseas Chinese Committee for the Defence of World Peace announced on October 5 that the number of signatures had reached 70,000. On October 1, the Jakarta Toronto Square held a conference to defend world peace, attended by more than 30,000 Indonesians and overseas Chinese. The conference passed a resolution supporting the Stockholm Appeal.
　　In British-ruled Malaya, the colonial government, under the so-called "Emergency Regulations," deprived the Malayan people of their freedom of assembly. However, this did not stop the people's yearning for world peace. On September 8, the Singapore-based progressive overseas Chinese newspaper *Nanyang Siang Pau* launched a campaign to respond to the peace signature movement. By September 17, 6,005 peace signature books had been sent to the newspaper from all over Malaya. As the Malayan signature movement was unfolding, the British colonial government brazenly closed down the newspaper on September 21. On the other hand, the underground newspaper *Freedom News* of the Malayan People's Liberation Alliance issued a special issue calling on the Malayan people to support the world peace movement with "actions to actively oppose British imperialism."
　　The people of Southeast Asian countries have suffered from imperialist aggression and brutal exploitation for hundreds of years. They have made a strong statement in the movement to defend world peace and are closely linking their liberation movement with the movement to defend world peace.

　　东南亚人民坚决保卫世界和平
    越缅印尼马来亚各地热烈进行和平签名
    【新华社十四日讯】东南亚各国人民在最近几个月中，热烈地展开了保卫世界和平的运动。在许多国家的许多城市与乡村中，广大人民均举行了集会，拥护斯德哥尔摩宣言，并进行了热烈的签名运动。在另外一些地区，虽有帝国主义殖民者的压制，但群众仍然进行了不屈不挠的斗争！
    在越南，和平签名运动在广大的人民群众中已如火如荼地展开。据塔斯社引电通社记者的报道，截至十月底止，签名人数共计有三百八十七万一千二百九十八名。越盟阵线中央委员会直辖机关的工作人员全部一千八百名，都在和平宣言上签了名。越南的和平签名运动深入到北方高原的少数民族中。九月初，谅山省一个少数民族的群众大会上，七千人在和平宣言上签名，其中一千七百名来自法军占领区。和平省内有六万少数民族人民通过自己的代表签名。在法军占领下的中越港口?江市，二万九千市民不顾法国军警的压制，在和平宣言上签了名。
    在缅甸，保卫世界和平大会缅甸分会，于六月中发起和平签名运动，预定征集二百万个签名。三个月来共征集了三百多万个签名，远超过了原定的目标。
    在印尼，在保卫世界和平大会印尼分会七月间在日惹成立后，签名运动立即在印尼各地展开。雅加达、万隆、井里汶、三宝垅、梭罗、泗水、棉兰等地，纷纷成立了支会。在勿里洞一地，已有四、九六七人签名，约占该地全人口的五分之一。在印尼首都雅加达，据华侨保卫世界和平委员会十月五日宣布，签名人数已有七万名。十月一日，雅加达多伦多伦广场举行了保卫世界和平大会，参加的有印尼人和华侨共三万多人。大会通过了拥护斯德哥尔摩宣言的决议。
    在英国统治下的马来亚，殖民政府在所谓“紧急法令”下，剥夺了马来亚人民集会的自由。然而，这并不能遏止人民对世界和平的热望。九月八日，新加坡市进步的华侨报纸《南侨日报》发动响应和平签名运动。到了九月十七日，便有六千零五人的和平签名书从马来亚各地寄到该报。当马来亚签名运动正在展开之际，英国殖民政府竟于九月二十一日悍然封闭该报。另一方面，马来亚人民解放同盟的地下报纸《自由报》发出专号，号召马来亚人民以“积极反对英帝国主义的行动”支持世界和运。
    东南亚各国人民几百年来饱受帝国主义的侵略与残酷的剥削。他们已对保卫世界和平运动作了有力的表示，并正把他们的解放运动和保卫世界和平的运动紧密地结合起来。
