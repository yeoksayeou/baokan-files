　　Inspired by Patriotic Enthusiasm for Resisting America and Aiding Korea
    Farmers in Hunan, Jiangxi, and Hubei Provinces Enthusiastically Deliver Grain

    [Report from this newspaper] Under the tide of resisting America, aiding Korea, safeguarding homes and defending the country, patriotic people from north to south of the Yangtze River are delivering public grain more enthusiastically and urgently. The numbers of public grain entering warehouses are rapidly increasing daily and hourly. As of the 15th of this month, Hunan has completed 102.4% of its original autumn grain requisition task; Jiangxi has completed 93.6%; and Hubei has completed more than 50%. The uncompleted portion can be delivered by the end of this month. The achievement of this great success is primarily due to the leadership of Party and government organs at all levels, which concentrated their efforts, thus basically implementing the policy of reasonable burden, carrying out a large-scale land survey and production assessment campaign, and conducting organized and planned warehousing work. Each province has organized "Grain Requisition Offices" by relevant departments and organized a large number of government cadres and intellectuals to go to the countryside to assist in grain requisition (Jiangxi alone reached 28,000 people), promptly understand the situation, disseminate experiences through newspapers, and correct deviations. At each stage of the work, they grasped ideological leadership. At the beginning of grain requisition, they generally correctly understood the consistency of policy and tasks, but individual cadres emphasized difficulties and were unwilling to accept tasks; while another group of comrades thought that the harvest was good and the task was light, were blindly optimistic, neglected policies, and acted carelessly. The instructions issued by the Central South Military and Political Committee on September 13 corrected this deviation. After the work unfolded, many regions conscientiously implemented the policy and adhered to tax assessment according to the rate, but some regions distributed tasks equally, resulting in excessively light burdens in wealthy areas and areas with concentrated land ownership, and excessively heavy burdens in poor areas and areas with scattered land ownership. In some "excessively light" areas, there were phenomena such as arbitrarily lowering tax rates, "reducing from the bottom up but not from the top down," "reducing the proportion," and narrowing the scope of the burden; in individual "excessively heavy" areas, there were phenomena of excessively increasing production and raising tax rates. The Central South Military and Political Committee issued an emergency instruction on October 6, and the Yangtze River Daily published three editorials, emphasizing the implementation of policies and acting in accordance with regulations, vigorously correcting this deviation, and stipulating practical and easy-to-implement methods for rent and tenant burdens. Various places have made necessary adjustments, vigorously surveyed land and assessed production, appropriately resolved the issue of rent and tenant burdens, and achieved relative fairness and reasonableness, winning the support of the broad masses. According to recent materials, no phenomenon of actual requisition exceeding the amount to be requisitioned has been found. When public grain began to enter warehouses, generally, organized and planned grain delivery and receipt could be achieved. However, in some areas, cadres developed the idea of "it's almost done, let's relax," and indulged and ignored illegal landlords who delayed or resisted grain delivery, and were not strict in grain quality inspection and not responsible enough for storage, resulting in 31 million catties of bad grain. The Central South Military and Political Committee re-issued the instruction "Pay Attention to Organizing Warehousing and Rescuing National Public Grain" on November 4, enabling public grain to enter warehouses smoothly. During the warehousing process, the broad masses of people demonstrated a high degree of patriotic enthusiasm. For example, Rao Dongsheng, a poor peasant in Shangrao, Jiangxi, dried and cleaned his grain before the public grain of each household was calculated, striving to deliver it first. Wu Shuixiang, a woman from Baima Township, Fengcheng, said: "In the old society, we lived under the feet of others. The 'Guomindang' squeezed oil from bran. If you delivered one grain of grain less or said one more word, the gun would beat you to scream like a ghost. Now, the grain requisition is fair and reasonable. We are delivering grain to our own government, and the government even provides food as a treat. The scale is fair, so who wouldn't want to strive to be a model?" She pushed 300 catties of grain at a time and led twenty-four women from the village to deliver grain. Many people in the society nodded and praised when they saw this scene: "The People's Government really has a way. I have never seen such an enthusiastic scene of grain delivery." "The people and the government are truly one family." Now, in areas where the collection has been completed, the broad masses of farmers are throwing themselves into the land reform movement under the slogan of "Deliver the emancipation grain, hurry up and make emancipation, and divide the land well."

　　抗美援朝的爱国热情鼓舞下
    湘赣鄂农民踊跃交粮
    【本报讯】在抗美援朝保家卫国的浪潮下，大江南北爱国人民正在更热烈更紧张的交纳公粮。公粮入库数字每日每时地迅速增加着。截至本月十五日止，湖南秋征已完成原分配任务的百分之一百零二点四；江西已完成百分之九十三点六；湖北已完成百分之五十以上。尚未完成部分，可于本月底交清这一伟大成绩的取得，首先是由于各级党政机关抓紧领导，力量集中，因而基本上贯彻了合理负担政策，开展了大规模的查田订产运动，进行了有组织有计划的入仓工作。各省均由各有关部门组织了“征粮办公室”，并组织大批机关干部、知识分子下乡助征（只江西即达二万八千人），及时了解情况，通过报纸，传播经验，纠正偏向，在工作各个阶段，抓紧了思想领导，在征粮开始时，一般的正确了解到政策与任务的一致性，但个别干部强调困难，不愿接受任务；而另一部分同志则以为年景好，任务轻，盲目乐观，忽视政策，马虎从事，中南军政委员会九月十三日发出的指示，纠正了这一偏向。当工作展开后，许多地区认真贯彻政策，坚持了依率计征，但有的地区平均分配任务，使富区和土地集中区畸轻，贫区和土地分散区畸重，在某些“畸轻”地区，发生擅自降低税率、“下减上不减”、“比例降低”及缩小负担面等现象；个别“畸重”地区则有过分提高产量及提高税率现象。中南军政委员会十月六日又发布紧急指示，长江日报曾发表三次社论，强调执行政策按条例办事，大力纠正这一偏向，并规定了切实易行的租佃负担办法，各地均进行了必要的调整，并大力查田订产，适当解决租佃负担问题，做到了比较公平合理，博得了广大群众的拥护。根据最近的材料，尚未发现实征额超过应征额的现象。当公粮开始入仓后，一般均能做到有组织有计划的交粮、收粮。但也有部分地区的干部发生“差不多了，松口气吧”的思想，对不法地主拖交抗交现象放任不理，对粮质检查不严，保管不够负责，致坏粮达三千一百万斤。中南军政委员会复于十一月四日发布“注意组织入仓，抢救国家公粮”的指示。使公粮得以顺利入仓。在入仓中，广大人民表现了高度的爱国热忱。如江西上饶贫农饶东生，当各户公粮还没有算出时，他就将谷子晒干扬净，争取先交。丰城白马乡妇女邬水香说：“旧社会，我们在人家脚底下过日子，“刮民党”糠里榨油，少交一粒粮，多说一句话，枪杆子打的你做鬼叫。现在征粮公平合理，给自己的政府送粮，政府还给菜叫招待，秤又公道，谁不愿争模范呢？”她一次推三百斤谷子，还带领村上二十四个妇女送粮。许多社会人士看到此种景象，都暗暗点头赞叹：“人民政府真有办法，从来没有见过这样踊跃交粮的景象。”“人民和政府真是一家人”。现在已完成征收的地区，广大农民正在“交完翻身粮，赶快闹翻身，好好把田分”的口号下，投入土改运动。（李成瑞）
