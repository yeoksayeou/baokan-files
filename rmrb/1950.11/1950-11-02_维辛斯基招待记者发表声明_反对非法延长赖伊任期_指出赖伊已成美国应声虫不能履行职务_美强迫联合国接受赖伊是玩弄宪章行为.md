　　Xinhua News Agency, New York, 1st TASS dispatch: Vyshinsky, head of the Soviet delegation to the Fifth UN General Assembly, held a press conference on October 30th at Lake Success, attended by many journalists representing American and foreign news agencies and broadcasting companies.

　　Vyshinsky said at the beginning of the press conference: "The Soviet delegation believes it is appropriate to hold this press conference on a very serious issue that our delegation attaches great importance to.

　　"You probably know that the issue of appointing the Secretary-General is on the agenda of the UN General Assembly tomorrow. It should be remembered that, according to the Charter, the General Assembly only has the right to consider the appointment of the Secretary-General based on the Security Council's recommendation. Article 97 of the Charter clearly states this. Rule 140 of the General Assembly's Rules of Procedure also clearly states this, which specifically defines the procedure for the General Assembly to appoint the Secretary-General.

　　"As everyone knows, the Security Council has so far failed to reach an agreement on the candidate for the position of Secretary-General. This is because the US delegation has consistently opposed recommending anyone other than the current Secretary-General for the position for a long time. Because of this, the Security Council has not made a recommendation on the appointment of the Secretary-General in accordance with the provisions of the Charter. It should be very clear that, under these circumstances, the General Assembly has no right to consider the appointment of the Secretary-General. In view of this, the Soviet delegation has requested the President of the General Assembly to postpone the date for considering the appointment of the Secretary-General and to request the Security Council to continue its efforts, in accordance with Article 97 of the Charter and Rule 140 of the General Assembly's Rules of Procedure, to recommend a unanimously agreed candidate for the position of Secretary-General.

　　"Today, we have learned that a group of delegations, led by the delegation of the United States of America, has submitted a proposal to the General Assembly to extend the term of office of the current Secretary-General, Lie. This proposal is blatantly contrary to the Charter, which generally stipulates that extensions of completed terms are not allowed. The General Assembly's decision of January 24, 1946, mentions the possibility of re-appointing the Secretary-General -- I repeat, re-appointing the Secretary-General, not extending his term; and even in this case, that is, in the case of re-appointing the Secretary-General, this decision stipulates that the same rules for appointing the Secretary-General must be followed. In other words, to re-appoint the Secretary-General, there must be a recommendation from the Security Council, and in accordance with Rule 140 of the Rules of Procedure, the General Assembly must consider this recommendation to resolve the issue of appointing the Secretary-General.

　　"Therefore, the proposal to extend the term of office of the Secretary-General is illegal. This is a trick designed to circumvent the provisions of the Charter. If the General Assembly has not received a recommendation from the Security Council now, this certainly does not mean that there will never be such a recommendation, because everyone knows that there are cases where a unanimous decision is not possible on a certain issue at one time, but later such a unanimous decision is found. I will recall the issue of Italian colonies as an example. For a long time, the Four Powers could not reach an agreement on this issue, and there were significant differences of opinion on the Italian peace treaty. But later, they reached agreement on a definite method, and this treaty proved to be acceptable to all, and the issue of Italian colonies was resolved. This example proves once again that in such matters, when important international political disputes are involved, when the issue concerns agreement on certain decisions and attitudes, there is absolutely no reason to act hastily. I want to say, especially not with hidden intentions, with the selfish interests of a certain group, with the attempt by a group of countries to use the situation to achieve its own purposes to the detriment of the common goals and interests of the United Nations, as a reason for acting hastily. Gentlemen, all of this seems so obvious that there should not seem to be any obstacles on the road to a correct resolution of this issue.

　　"But because the US delegation, at any cost, stubbornly insists on keeping Lie in the position of Secretary-General, in violation of the requirements of the Charter, as if there is no one more suitable than Lie at all, then the situation is different.

　　"It is everyone's duty to abide by the Charter, and everyone must comply with the Charter and the rules it establishes. This is naturally particularly important when dealing with such a serious issue as the appointment of the Secretary-General."

　　After this, Vyshinsky read out the following statement that the Soviet delegation would present to the plenary session of the United Nations General Assembly:

　　"The issue of the United Nations Secretary-General is of enormous political importance. This importance has been determined by the following fact: the main task that the United Nations has set for itself is to maintain international peace and security and to develop friendship and cooperation among nations. In order to conform to these lofty goals, the United Nations Secretary-General must be a person of some objectivity and impartiality, who does not succumb to the influence and pressure of a certain government, even if these governments may be powerful.

　　"The actual situation of the work of the United Nations has shown that Lie cannot be said to be an objective and impartial person who can maintain independence and not succumb to these influences or other influences. A person like Lie can only perform his duties in some private enterprise and not in such an important international organization as the United Nations. Lie has played a double-dealing trick in his work, a fact that even some delegations that are now forcing through this candidate and forcing the United Nations to accept him have secretly admitted. It is now very clear that he has lost the respect and trust of many United Nations member states and has in fact become an echo of the US delegation; this fact cannot be ignored if the international authority of the United Nations is to be valued.

　　"As everyone knows, not only the Soviet Union has nominated candidates for Secretary-General, but also several other members of the Security Council have nominated many candidates for Secretary-General, including: Rau (India), Malik (Lebanon), Nájera (Mexico), Romulo (Philippines), etc. No one has raised objections to these people. However, due to the arbitrary pressure exerted by the US delegation, as well as its threat to use its veto power against any candidate other than Lie, all efforts to reach an agreement on a new candidate for the position of Secretary-General have been completely undermined.

　　"Therefore, someone is trying to force the United Nations to accept Lie as the United Nations Secretary-General as ordered by the United States.

　　"The United Nations Charter states that 'The Secretary-General shall be appointed by the General Assembly upon the recommendation of the Security Council.' From this, it appears that if there is a divergence of opinion among the permanent members of the Security Council, or if there is no established majority in the Security Council, the Security Council must take measures in accordance with the provisions of the Charter regarding decisions on important issues to reach an agreement on the issue of the Secretary-General candidate.

　　"Because the Soviet Union and several other countries oppose the extension of Lie's term as Secretary-General; then, the attempt to force Lie into this position, regardless of the United Nations Charter and the powers of the Security Council, is a manipulation of the United Nations and its Charter.

　　"The same manipulation of the United Nations and its Charter is the attempt to circumvent the Security Council and violate its powers by extending Lie's term for three years, as this is also in direct contradiction with the United Nations Charter.

　　"The Soviet delegation believes it must declare that if the United Nations is forced to accept the extension of Lie's term, the Soviet government will not deal with him due to the above-mentioned circumstances, and will not recognize him as the Secretary-General of the United Nations."

　　Vyshinsky told the journalists present that the Soviet delegation believed it was necessary to draw their attention to the above-mentioned statement so that public opinion would be aware that under the pressure of the US delegation, the Charter has been shamefully violated, and the US delegation is trying to force the United Nations to listen to its demands on the issue of appointing the Secretary-General.

　　维辛斯基招待记者发表声明
    反对非法延长赖伊任期
    指出赖伊已成美国应声虫不能履行职务
    美强迫联合国接受赖伊是玩弄宪章行为
    【新华社讯】塔斯社纽约一日讯：苏联出席第五届联合国大会代表团团长维辛斯基于十月三十日在成功湖举行记者招待会，参加者有代表美国及外国的通讯社与广播公司的很多记者。
    维辛斯基在记者招待会开始时说：“苏联代表团认为允宜就一个很严重的、我们代表团很重视的问题举行这次记者招待会。
    “你们大概知道，联合国大会明天的议程上有任命秘书长的问题。应该记住，按照宪章，大会唯有根据安理会的推荐才有权考虑任命秘书长问题。宪章第九十七条明白地载明这一点。联大议事规则第一百四十条也明白地载明这一点，这条规则特别确定了大会任命秘书长的工作的程序。
    “众所周知，安理会迄今为止未能对秘书长一职的候选人获致协议，这是由于美国代表团很久以来即一贯反对推荐现任秘书长以外的任何人为该职的候选人。由于这个缘故，目前安理会就没有按照宪章的规定提出关于任命秘书长的建议。事情应该十分清楚，在这种情况下，大会无权考虑任命秘书长的问题。有鉴于此，苏联代表团已请求大会主席推迟考虑任命秘书长问题的日期，并请求安理会按照宪章第九十七条及大会议事规则第一百四十条继续努力以推荐一致同意的秘书长一职的候选人。
    “今天，我们获悉，以美利坚合众国代表团为首的一群代表团已向大会提出了延长现任秘书长赖伊之任期的建议。这一建议彰明昭著地与宪章相抵触，宪章一般地规定不许延长已满的任期。联大一九四六年一月二十四日的决定谈到再度任命秘书长的可能性，——我再说一遍，重行任命秘书长，而不是延长他的任期；并且即使在这种情况下，即在重行任命秘书长的情况下，这个决定也规定要遵从关于任命秘书长的同一规则。换句话说，要重行任命秘书长就必须有安理会的推荐，按照议事规则第一百四十条，大会必须考虑这种推荐，以解决任命秘书长问题。
    “所以，提出延长秘书长任期的问题是不合法的。这是旨在越过宪章的规定的诡计。如果大会现在没有接到安理会的推荐，这当然并不意味着永不会有这种推荐，因为大家知道有些情形是这样的：在一个时期中，对某一问题不可能获致一致同意的决定，但后来却又找到了这种一致同意的决定。我将追述意大利殖民地问题，作为例子。曾有很长时间四强对这问题不能达到协议，在对意和约上意见有很大分歧。但是后来，它们取得了关于一个确定的方法，这个条约证明能为全体接受，意大利殖民地的问题也就得到了解决。这个例子再度证明：在这样事情上，当涉及重要的国际政治争端时，当问题关涉对于某些决定和态度的协议时，匆促行事是绝对没有理由的，我要说，尤其不能以隐藏的思想，以某集团，以企图利用情势达到自己的目的而损害联合国的共同宗旨与利益的某一群国家的自私自利的利益，作为匆促行事的理由。各位先生，这一切看起来是如此明显，以致在走向正确解决这个问题的道路上似乎不应该遇到任何障碍。
    “但是由于美国代表团，不惜任何代价，违犯宪章的要求而顽固地坚持要使赖伊保持秘书长的职位，好像比赖伊更适当的人根本就不存在一样，于是情形就两样了。
    “遵守宪章是每一个人的义务，每一个人都必须遵从宪章以及宪章所确立的规则。在涉及任命秘书长这样严重问题时，这一点自然是特别重要。”
    此后，维辛斯基即宣读苏联代表团要在联合国大会的全体会议上提出的下述声明：
    “联合国秘书长问题具有巨大的政治重要性。这一重要性已由下列事实决定：联合国为自己确定的主要任务乃是维持国际和平与安全及发展国际间的友谊与合作。为了符合于这些崇高的目的，联合国秘书长必须是具有一些客观性公正性的人，不向某一个政府的影响与压力屈服，虽然这些政府也许是有势力的。
    “联合国工作的实际情况已经表明，赖伊不能说是可以保持独立并且不向这些影响或其他影响屈服的客观的公正的人。像赖伊这样的人，只能够在什么私人企业中而不能在像联合国这种重要的国际组织中履行职务。赖伊在他的工作中玩弄了两面派的把戏，这一事实甚至某些现在正逼迫通过这个候选人并强使联合国接受他的代表团也已偷偷地承认了。现在已很明白，他在失去了许多联合国会员国的尊重与信任之后，已在事实上成为美国代表团的应声虫；如果联合国的国际权威要受到重视的话，这一事实是不容忽视的。
    “尽人皆知，不但苏联提出秘书长候选人而且若干其他安理会理事国也提出许多秘书长候选人，这些人就是：劳氏（印度）麦里克（黎巴嫩），纳孚（墨西哥），罗慕洛（菲律宾）等。对于这些人，并没有人提出反对。但是由于美国代表团施用了横暴的压力，以及它威胁以使用否决权反对除赖伊以外的任何其他候选人，要对秘书长一职新候选人获致协议的一切努力已被破坏无遗。
    “因此，有人正竭力强使联合国像美国所命令的那样接受赖伊充当联合国秘书长。
    “联合国宪章指出，“秘书长应由大会经安全理事会之推荐委派之。由此看来，如果安理会常任理事国之间意见有分歧，或者安理会中没有既定的多数时，安理会必须依照宪章中关于重要问题之决定的规定采取措施以对秘书长候选的问题获致协议。
    “因为苏联以及若干其他国家反对延长赖伊秘书长的任期；那么，不顾联合国宪章和安理会的权力，而强把赖伊安置在这一职位上的企图便是对联合国及其宪章的玩弄行为。
    “对联合国及其宪章同样的玩弄行为是企图越过安理会并违犯它的权力而延长赖伊的任期三年，因为这也是与联合国宪章截然抵触的。
    “苏联代表团认为必须声明，如果强使联合国接受延长赖伊的任期，苏联政府由于上述情况将不与他办交涉，并且将不承认他是联合国的秘书长”。
    维辛斯基告在场的记者们说，苏联代表团认为必须使他们注意上述声明，俾使舆论知悉在美国代表团的压力下，宪章已受到可耻的违背，美国代表团力图在任命秘书长问题上强迫联合国听从它的要求。
