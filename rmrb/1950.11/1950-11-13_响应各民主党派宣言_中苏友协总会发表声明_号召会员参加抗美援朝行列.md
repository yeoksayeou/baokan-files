Xinhua News Agency, November 11th: The Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Headquarters issued the following statement in response to the joint declaration of various democratic parties:

　　American imperialism is baring its fangs and brandishing its claws, following the old path of Japanese imperialism, recklessly launching and expanding the war of aggression against Korea, occupying our Taiwan, and violating our airspace and territorial waters. Now, the flames of war have spread to our borders. American imperialism is not only frantically massacring the Korean people and endangering our security, but is also threatening the peace of the entire Asia and even the entire world.

　　The Sino-Soviet Friendship Association has always wholeheartedly defended world peace and vowed to contribute all its strength to strengthening Sino-Soviet friendship, which is inseparable from defending world peace. Therefore, we firmly support the Soviet Foreign Minister Vyshinsky's proposal at the United Nations General Assembly on "Curbing the Threat of a New War, Consolidating World Peace and Security." However, we are also not afraid of any imperialists provoking a war of aggression. Therefore, we also firmly support Premier Zhou Enlai's statement that "The Chinese people will never tolerate foreign aggression, nor can they stand idly by while imperialists肆行aggress against their neighbors" and the solemn declaration of various democratic parties supporting the whole nation in resisting America, aiding Korea, protecting our homes, and defending our country.

　　The launching of aggression and provocation of war by American imperialism is not to be feared. As long as the people of China and the Soviet Union unite as one, thereby uniting the people of the whole world, under the leadership of the great Marshal Stalin, the standard-bearer of peace and democracy in the world, we will surely be able to defeat all imperialists and war instigators. Because, as the Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union Molotov said, "The friendship between China and the Soviet Union has become a great and strong force for consolidating world peace; this force is unparalleled and unprecedented in human history."

　　We call on all members of the Friendship Association, whose patriotic and internationalist blood is boiling, to quickly participate in the sacred ranks of resisting America, aiding Korea, protecting our homes, and defending our country with active actions.

　  中苏友协总会发表声明
    号召会员参加抗美援朝行列
    【新华社十一日讯】中苏友好协会总会为响应各民主党派联合宣言发表声明如下：
    美帝国主义正张牙舞爪，走着日本帝国主义的老路，不顾一切地发动并扩大了侵略朝鲜的战争，侵占了我国台湾，侵犯了我国的领空和领海。现在，战争的火焰已经扑到我国边境上来了。美帝国主义不仅在疯狂地屠杀着朝鲜人民和危害我国的安全，并且进而威胁着整个亚洲以至整个世界的和平。
    中苏友好协会一向是全心全意地保卫世界和平，并誓为与保卫世界和平不可分割的加强中苏友好供献出一切力量。因此，我们坚决拥护苏联外长维辛斯基在联合国大会上关于《制止新战争威胁、巩固世界和平与安全》的提案。但是，我们也决不害怕任何帝国主义挑起侵略战争。因此，我们同时也坚决拥护周恩来总理的《中国人民决不能容忍外国的侵略，也不能够任帝国主义者对自己的邻人肆行侵略而置之不理》的声明和全国各民主党派支持全国人民抗美援朝保家卫国的庄严宣言。
    美帝国主义的发动侵略和挑拨战争是毫不足畏的，只要中苏两国人民团结一致从而使全世界人民的团结一致，在全世界和平、民主的旗手斯大林大元帅的领导下，就一定可以击溃一切帝国主义者和战争挑拨者。因为正如苏联部长会议副主席莫洛托夫所说，“中苏两国的友谊，成为了巩固全世界和平的伟大而坚强的力量；这种力量，是无可匹敌的，而且在人类历史上也是空前无可匹敌的”。
    我们号召所有沸腾着爱国主义和国际主义的热血的全体友协会员们，迅速地以积极的行动参加抗美援朝保家卫国的神圣行列。
                                                  十一月十一日
