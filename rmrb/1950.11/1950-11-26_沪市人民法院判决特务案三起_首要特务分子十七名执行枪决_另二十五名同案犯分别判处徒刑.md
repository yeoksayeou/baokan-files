Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, November 23rd: The Shanghai People's Court has sentenced individuals involved in three counter-revolutionary armed espionage cases. The principal offenders, Li Xianzhong, Cheng Shuhuai, Zhu Junquan, Zheng Haoxi, Zheng Jun, Jiang Shiheng, Dou Yi, Wu Zibin, Wang Zhen, Zhao Jingxiang, Zang Manya, Ge Guguang, Ge Shangcai, Cheng Jiajie, Shao Feng, Chen Jufu, and Xue Lijie, were all sentenced to death. With the approval of the Shanghai Military Control Commission, the sentences were carried out by firing squad on the 15th.

	Li Xianzhong Case: The principal offender, Li Xianzhong, was originally a staff member of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit army. Before the liberation of Shanghai, he fled to Zhoushan, where he was appointed as the "Commander of the Southeast People's Anti-Communist National Salvation Army Su-Zhe-Wan Border Area Advance Column." In March of this year, he was again ordered by the bandit Mao Sen to lead bandits, carrying radio transmitters and guns, to infiltrate Shanghai. He also successively dispatched bandits to infiltrate Yixing and Danyang in Southern Jiangsu to organize espionage armed forces. The bandit Cheng Shuhuai was originally a Chiang bandit corps commander, later appointed by Mao Sen as the bandit "Su-Zhe-Wan Border Area Commander," to supervise the work of the bandit Li Xianzhong. The bandit Cheng also appointed the former puppet "Deputy Commander of the First District Security of Jiangsu Province," the bandit Dou Yi, as his "Deputy Commander," jointly plotting to organize espionage armed forces in the Taihu Lake area. The bandit Zhu Junquan was the "Chief of Staff" of the bandit Li Xianzhong, and had infiltrated our public security organs to gather military intelligence. The bandit Zheng Haoxi was originally a member of the Jiangning Branch of the Shanghai Municipal People's Government Public Security Bureau, and the bandit Zheng Jun was originally a guard at our Public Security Bureau detention center. The two willingly joined the bandits, betrayed the people, and engaged in espionage activities together with the bandit Zhu Junquan. The bandit Jiang Shiheng harbored the bandit Li and others, and was appointed as the "Station Chief of the Shanghai Liaison Station" of the bandit organization. The above seven criminals are all incorrigible counter-revolutionaries and are each sentenced to death. Twelve other accomplices, including the bandit Hu Qingyun, were sentenced to imprisonment ranging from five to fifteen years, depending on the severity of their crimes.

	Wu Zibin Case: The principal offender, Wu Zibin, came from the Kuomintang espionage organization Blue Shirts Society and was an important espionage element of the bandit "Military Intelligence." Before the liberation of Shanghai, he served as the "Colonel Inspector" of the puppet Traffic Police Bureau. After the liberation of Shanghai, he was ordered by the bandit "Military Intelligence" espionage organization to lie dormant and engage in activities. Together with Zhao Jingxiang, Zang Manya, Ge Guguang, Wang Zhen, and others, he organized the bandit "National Revolutionary Anti-Communist National Salvation Army," with Ge serving as "Acting Commander-in-Chief" and Zang as "Deputy Commander." The bandit Wu, using his identity as the "Shanghai Representative" of the bandit "Military Intelligence" espionage leaders, the bandits Ji Zhangjian and Huang Zhenwu, plotted behind the scenes, attempting to organize counter-revolutionary armed forces in the Yiwu, Dongyang, and Shengxian areas of Zhejiang. The bandits Zhao Jingxiang and Wang Zhen were both elements of the bandit "Traffic Police" and "Military Intelligence." They were both appointed by the bandit Wu as "Deputy Commanders of the Yi-Dong-Sheng Area." The traitor Cheng Jiajie defected and degenerated after the Great Revolution of 1927, colluding with the bandit Wang Zhen to engage in counter-revolutionary activities. The bandit Ge Shangcai was an unlawful landlord in Fengxian, colluding with the bandit Wu and others, using his home to shelter counter-revolutionary elements. The above criminals are all principal elements in the case and are each sentenced to death. Eleven other accomplices, including the bandit Wu Xueling, were each sentenced to imprisonment ranging from ten months to fifteen years.

	Shao Feng Case: The principal offender, Shao Feng, was a "Military Intelligence" espionage element. After the liberation of Shanghai, he served as the "Deputy Commander of the Anti-Communist Self-Defense Force of the People of the Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou Region" of the bandit "Ministry of National Defense," organizing espionage armed forces. In January of this year, the bandit sneaked to Zhoushan and was again ordered by the bandit Mao Sen to return to Shanghai in March, secretly establishing a radio station to collect military and political intelligence for the American Chiang Kai-shek bandits. The bandit Chen Jufu was originally a "Military Intelligence" espionage element. After the liberation of Shanghai, he surrendered to the People's Government, but later colluded with the bandit Shao and voluntarily contributed funds to help the bandit Shao establish a radio station. The bandit Xue Lijie was originally a local tyrant in Changzhou, Jiangsu. After the liberation of Changzhou, he sneaked into Shanghai and joined the bandit "Anti-Communist Self-Defense Force of the People of the Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou Region" of the bandit "Ministry of National Defense," serving as the "Wu (Jin) Dan (Yang) Jin (Tan) Commander." The bandit convened meetings in Shanghai, actively engaging in activities and developing manpower and weapons. The above three criminals are all incorrigible and are each sentenced to death. The accomplices, the bandit Tan Hanran and the bandit Zheng Guoying, were each sentenced to imprisonment ranging from four to seven years, depending on the severity of their crimes.
