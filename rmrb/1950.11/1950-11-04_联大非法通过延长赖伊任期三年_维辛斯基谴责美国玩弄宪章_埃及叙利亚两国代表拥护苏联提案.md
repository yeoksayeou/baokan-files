Xinhua News Agency, New York, November 2nd (TASS): The United Nations General Assembly continued its debate on the appointment of the United Nations Secretary-General at its morning session on November 1st.

The head of the Soviet delegation, Vyshinsky, spoke first, elaborating on the speeches of the representatives of the Anglo-American bloc. These representatives attempted to prove that it was legal for the General Assembly to decide to extend Lie's term as Secretary-General for three years without the recommendation of the Security Council. Vyshinsky reiterated that these representatives' arguments were completely untenable in law. He pointed out that attempting to drag Lie into the Secretary-General's office, disregarding the UN Charter and the powers of the Security Council, was to manipulate the United Nations and its Charter.

Referring to Philippine representative Romulo's statement that the dispute over the appointment of the Secretary-General was a "typical example of a deadlock arising from the principle of great power unanimity," Vyshinsky proved that this deadlock was absolutely not caused by the principle of great power unanimity, but by the lack of respect for and compliance with this principle. Vyshinsky continued: Indeed, the principle of great power unanimity, as applied to the issue of recommending the Secretary-General, lies in the fact that if one of the permanent members of the Security Council opposes a particular candidate, these permanent members should abide by the principle of great power unanimity and no longer insist on recommending that candidate. The Charter requires this. Vyshinsky continued: If this requirement of the Charter could be implemented, then there would be no deadlock, because a deadlock only occurs when the principle of great power unanimity is violated.

Vyshinsky recalled that when the issue of appointing the Secretary-General was discussed in the Security Council, the Soviet delegation abided by this principle. After nominating Polish Foreign Minister Modzelewski, the Soviet delegation, seeing that there was opposition to this candidate, no longer insisted on a candidate that other members of the Security Council deemed unsuitable. On the contrary, the Soviet delegation was willing to support other candidates—Romulo, Lauwers, Naffah, Malik (Lebanon)—, who, although not actually opposed, were all withdrawn for the sole reason that the US delegation threatened to veto any candidate other than Lie.

Vyshinsky said: We are told that the deadlock arises from the principle of great power unanimity. We believe that this is not the crux of the problem. The problem is that certain representatives—primarily the US representative—are unwilling to respect the Charter and its provisions, which tell us exactly how to properly resolve a deadlock.

Vyshinsky also pointed out that the assertion that the Soviet delegation opposed Lie in order to "punish" him for supporting the Anglo-American majority policy on the Korean issue was untenable. Vyshinsky declared: This assertion is completely unfounded; people can see from the fact that the Soviet delegation was willing to support candidates (such as Romulo) who enthusiastically supported the policy on Korea no less than Lie.

Vyshinsky pointed out that the Soviet delegation opposed the extension of Lie's term because he was not a suitable person to perform the duties of the United Nations Secretary-General, a fact that had been acknowledged by the delegations of other countries—even those who favored extending his term.

Vyshinsky reiterated that the Security Council should undertake new efforts to reach a unanimous resolution on the issue of candidates for the United Nations Secretary-General. He said: There is still ample time before the end of the Fifth General Assembly for the Security Council to find a positive solution to this problem.

At the same time, Vyshinsky emphasized that illegally extending Lie's term as United Nations Secretary-General would be to manipulate the principles of the Charter and the entire United Nations organization, and would be an act of tyranny by the majority against the minority, against the Charter, and against the constitution that is the foundation of the United Nations. Vyshinsky declared: Without respect for this constitution, our organization cannot survive and perform its duties, it will die, it will wither, it will perish.

The next speaker, Egyptian representative El Din, emphasized the particular importance of the issue under discussion and the need to consider its legal aspects. He called on national representatives to resolve the issue fully in accordance with the principles of the United Nations Charter. El Din said that his delegation firmly supported the stability of a correct interpretation of the United Nations Charter. He said that the Egyptian delegation had never doubted the correctness of the Soviet delegation's views on the illegal appointment of the United Nations Secretary-General. El Din added that it would be more reasonable and fairer if not one but several candidates for United Nations Secretary-General were put forward for discussion in the General Assembly. In conclusion, El Din said that the Egyptian delegation fully supported the proposal put forward by the Soviet delegation.

Syrian representative El-Khouri criticized the US position, saying that according to Article 97 of the United Nations Charter, it was quite clear that the Security Council must submit recommendations to the General Assembly on this issue. However, he said, it was obviously useless to insist that the Security Council hold another meeting to consider the matter, especially since a permanent member of the Security Council (the US representative—editor) had issued a statement to the world, stating that he would veto any candidate—other than the current Secretary-General. El-Khouri said that, according to the Charter, the Security Council was not limited to recommending a single candidate. He said that the deadlock could have been avoided if the Security Council could have agreed to submit several candidates (including Lie) to the General Assembly for discussion. El-Khouri emphasized that the Syrian delegation did not want to participate in any illegal procedures.

Indian representative Rau, in a brief speech, described the recent discussions in the Security Council, attempting to defend the US proposal, arguing that "legal experts" considered the proposal to be legal.

Iraqi representative Jamali suggested that a committee be established to study the whole issue and report possible solutions to the General Assembly within two weeks.

The General Assembly then proceeded to vote. First, the General Assembly rejected the Soviet proposal to postpone discussion of the issue until the Security Council had made a recommendation, with nine votes in favor, thirty-seven votes against, and eleven abstentions.

The General Assembly then rejected the Iraqi proposal to submit the entire issue to a committee established for this purpose, with fifteen votes in favor, thirty-five votes against, and seven abstentions.

The US proposal was then put to a vote; the proposal was adopted with forty-six votes in favor, five votes against, and seven abstentions (including Egypt, Iraq, the Kuomintang, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, and Australia).

The General Assembly then adopted the new rules of procedure without dissent.

The morning session of the General Assembly then adjourned.

　　联大非法通过延长赖伊任期三年
    维辛斯基谴责美国玩弄宪章
    埃及叙利亚两国代表拥护苏联提案
    【新华社讯】塔斯社纽约二日电：联合国大会在十一月一日上午会议中继续辩论任命联合国秘书长的问题。
    首先发言的苏联代表团团长维辛斯基详细谈到英美集团代表们的演说。这些代表们企图证明：不用安全理事会的推荐而由大会决定来延长赖伊的秘书长任期三年是合法的。维辛斯基再度证明这些代表的说法在法律上是完全站不住的。他指出：不顾联合国宪章和安全理事会的权力企图把赖伊拖入秘书长办公室的做法，是玩弄联合国和它的宪章。
    维辛斯基在谈到菲律宾代表罗慕洛所说任命秘书长问题的纠纷是一个“由大国一致原则所发生的典型僵局例子”时证明：这个僵局绝对不是由大国一致的原则所发生的，而是由于不尊重和不遵守这个原则的结果。维辛斯基接着说：的确，大国一致原则如施用于推荐秘书长一职的问题上，就在于：如果安全理事会的一个常任理事国反对这个或那个候选人，这些常任理事国就应该遵守大国一致的原则而不要再坚持推荐这个候选人。宪章要求这样做。维辛斯基继续说：假如能执行宪章的这个要求，那末就不会有僵局，因为僵局只有在大国一致原则遭到破坏的时候才会发生。
    维辛斯基追述说：当任命秘书长的问题在安全理事会讨论时，苏联代表团遵守这个原则。苏联代表团在提名波兰外长莫塞莱夫斯基之后，因为看到有人反对这个候选人，所以不再坚持安全理事会其他理事国认为不适宜的这个候选人。相反的，苏联代表团愿意支持其他候选人——罗慕洛、劳氏、纳孚、麦里克（黎巴嫩）——，这些候选人虽然没有实际上遭到反对，但却都被撤消，而唯一原因就是：美国代表团方面威胁着要用否决权来反对除了赖伊以外的任何候选人。
    维辛斯基说：有人告诉我们：僵局是由大国一致的原则所发生的。我们认为：这并不是问题的症结所在。问题是：某些代表——首先是美国代表——不愿尊重宪章和它的条款，而这些条款恰好告诉我们应该怎样适当地去解决僵局。
    维辛斯基并且指出：有人说苏联代表团反对赖伊是为了要“惩罚”他在朝鲜问题上支持美英多数的政策，这种说法是站不住的。维辛斯基宣称：这种说法是完全没有根据的；人们可以从一件事实中看出来：苏联代表团愿意支持那些热烈支持对朝鲜的政策并不逊于赖伊的候选人（例如罗慕洛）。
    维辛斯基指出：苏联代表团反对延长赖伊的任期因为他并不是一个适合于履行联合国秘书长职务的人，这一事实已经为其他国家的代表团——甚至是那些赞成延长他的任期的代表团——所承认。
    维辛斯基再度坚持由安全理事会从事新的努力，以便在联合国秘书长候选人问题上达成一致同意的决议。他说：在五届大会结束以前尚有充分时间让安全理事会对这个问题求得积极解决的办法。
    同时，维辛斯基强调指出：非法延长赖伊的联合国秘书长任期将是玩弄宪章的原则和整个联合国组织，将是多数反对少数、反对宪章、反对作为联合国基础的宪法的专横行为。维辛斯基宣称：如果不尊重这部宪法，我们的组织就不能生存和执行职务，它就会死亡，它就会凋敝，它就会毁灭。
    下一个发言的埃及代表艾定强调目前所讨论的问题的特别重要性以及需要考虑到它的法律方面。他要求各国代表充分依照联合国宪章的原则来解决这个问题。艾定说：他的代表团坚决支持正确地解释联合国宪章的稳定性。他说：埃及代表团从没有怀疑过苏联代表团对于非法任命联合国秘书长所持的意见的正确性。艾定又说：如果不是一个而是几个联合国秘书长候选人被提出来在大会上讨论，这才是比较合理的和公平的。艾定在结语中说：埃及代表团充分支持苏联代表团所提出的提案。
    叙利亚代表埃尔——古里抨击美国的立场说：根据联合国宪章第九十七条，十分清楚，安全理事会必须向大会提出关于这个问题的建议。但是，他说，坚持安全理事会再举行一次会议考虑这问题显然是没有用的，特别是因为安全理事会的一个常任理事（美国代表——编者）已向全世界发表了声明，这声明说：任何候选人——除了现任的秘书长以外——他都要否决。埃尔——古里说：根据宪章，安理会并不限于推荐单一的候选人。他说：如果安全理事会能够同意提出几个候选人（包括赖伊在内）提交大会讨论的话，那么这种僵局是可以避免的。埃尔——古里着重指出：叙利亚代表团并不想参加任何非法的程序。
    印度代表劳氏在简短的发言中，叙述了最近安全理事会的讨论，他企图为美国提出的建议进行辩护，借口说“法律专家们”认为这个建议是合法的。
    伊拉克代表贾马利建议成立一个委员会，研究整个的问题，并在两星期内向大会报告可能的解决办法。
    大会随即进行表决。首先，大会以九票赞成，三十七票反对和十一票弃权否决了苏联所提关于在安理会未提出推荐以前暂缓讨论这一问题的提案。
    大会随后否决了伊拉克所提关于将整个问题提交为了这种目的而成立的委员会的提案，十五票赞成，三十五票反对，七票弃权。
    然后对美国的建议进行表决；这个提案以四十六票赞成，五票反对及七票弃权（包括埃及、伊拉克、国民党、黎巴嫩、沙特阿拉伯、澳大利亚）获得通过。
    然后，大会无异议地通过了新的议事规则。
    至此，大会的上午会议即告休会。
