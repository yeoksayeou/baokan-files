Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 25th: The industrial and commercial departments of the Wuhan Municipal People's Government and state-owned companies have strengthened the supply of materials and market management, and strictly cracked down on speculative commerce, which has achieved considerable results.

Due to continuous autumn rains in Wuhan in October, coupled with the busy farming season in the countryside, the supply of goods to the market decreased. Some illegal merchants took the opportunity to seize goods and hoard them, which led to an increase in the prices of major commodities such as grain and cotton yarn. The difference between market prices and listed prices widened, and the state of transactions was not normal enough. In order to resolutely implement the policy of stabilizing market prices, the Wuhan Municipal People's Government's Bureau of Industry and Commerce and state-owned trading companies, based on the instructions of the Central People's Government and the Central and Southern Military and Political Committee, first focused on stabilizing the prices of grain and cotton yarn, vigorously selling them, and adjusting the ratio of cotton to grain and the price difference between Hankou and various cotton-producing areas in Hubei. Secondly, flower, yarn, and cloth exchanges were successively established or restored. It was stipulated that regardless of public or private factories, anyone buying or selling more than three dan of cotton, one piece of cotton yarn, or twenty bolts of cloth must conduct transactions centrally at the exchange, strictly cracking down on various speculative behaviors. At the same time, the management of public and private material purchasing units was strengthened, and joint purchases were advocated to ensure planned and unified distribution; private cotton merchants were helped to organize joint operation institutions to overcome the speculative and blind nature of their past operations. As a result of the above measures, the room for speculation by some private merchants was reduced. Since the end of October, the market prices of rice and polished rice have first stabilized and fallen to levels close to the listed prices of state-owned companies. The ratio of cotton to grain and the regional price difference of cotton have also become more reasonable, and cotton prices have begun to stabilize. Due to centralized transactions of cotton yarn, applications for purchasing yarn must be strictly reviewed before registration is allowed, which has greatly reduced the phenomenon of rushing to purchase. The average daily number of cotton yarn application registrations and transactions has decreased by about 50% compared with the abnormal transaction situation in October. The price of each piece of yarn is stable at around 6.35 million yuan. As of the 18th of this month, the market prices of major commodities such as grain, cotton, yarn, and cloth in the city have generally been on par with the listed prices, and the trend is stable. Market transactions remain active. Compared with the transaction volume in early November and late October: rice increased by 25.6%, polished rice increased by 51%, wheat increased by 85%, and tung oil increased by 17%.

Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 26th: The price of goods in Xi'an once became unstable since mid-October. After timely measures were taken by the state trade organs and the People's Bank, it has now returned to stability.

Since the middle of last month, some merchants in Xi'an who did not understand the overall situation, seeing the active market transactions since the autumn harvest,妄想 (wang xiang – recklessly hoped) to take the opportunity to hoard and drive up prices. Therefore, the Xi'an market temporarily showed a state of instability, and the sales volume of major commodities such as flour and cotton cloth increased abnormally sharply. The prices of wheat and cotton yarn also rose accordingly.

In order to resolutely implement the policy of stabilizing prices, the Xi'an Municipal Industrial and Commercial Administration Department, the state-owned trading company, and the People's Bank coordinated and implemented a number of measures to stabilize prices: the state-owned trading company maintained the original listed prices and vigorously sold cloth, food rice, flour, salt, etc. Among them, the currency recovered from the sale of salt alone increased by an average of about ten times compared with November 1st. The People's Bank began to strengthen the management of cash of state organs on November 7, and the balance of bank deposits increased daily. November 8 increased by 33.4% compared with the 6th, and the 10th increased by 42.1% compared with the 8th. The industrial and commercial administrative departments have also strengthened market management, such as cotton yarn being jointly sold by the state-owned cotton yarn and cloth company in conjunction with various yarn factories, and distributed to various cloth factories in a planned manner to ensure that producers obtain flat-priced yarn; at the same time, all yarn merchants and yarn storage households are registered, and the yarn stored by non-business households must be sold within a limited time. In addition, the industrial and commercial leading organs have strengthened the management of various industries and strictly prohibited speculative behaviors such as illegal operations that do not follow the regulations and jump industries. The above measures have prompted industrialists and businessmen to recognize the correct policy of the government to stabilize prices, the phenomenon of rushing to purchase has gradually decreased, and the prices of various goods have moved towards stability. For example, in the three days from November 7 to 10, flour, cloth, matches, etc. fell back by an average of 3.5% compared with before the 7th. The sales volume of state-owned trading companies has also undergone great changes. From November 7 to 13, at the original listed price level, flour sales decreased by 80% and sales of various cloths decreased by 65%, and it began to return to normal.

Now the state trade organs in Xi'an are continuing to take various effective measures and master abundant materials to consolidate price stability.

　　武汉、西安加强市场管理
    物价稳定交易活跃
    【新华社汉口二十五日电】武汉市人民政府工商部门和国营公司，加强物资供应和市场管理，严格取缔投机商业，已获相当成效。
    武汉市十月间由于秋雨连绵，又值乡间农忙，上市物资减少，部分不法商人即乘机抢货囤积，因此使粮棉等主要物价上涨，市价与牌价差额扩大，交易状态也不够正常。为坚决贯彻稳定市场物价的方针，武汉市人民政府工商局和国营贸易公司，根据中央人民政府及中南军政委员会的指示，首先以稳定粮食与棉纱价格为主，大力抛售，并调整了棉、粮比价及汉口与湖北各产棉区的差价。其次又先后成立或恢复了花、纱、布交易所，规定不论公私厂商，凡买卖棉花三担、棉纱一件、布二十匹以上者，须一律集中交易所成交，严格取缔了各种投机行为。与此同时又加强了公私物资采购单位的管理，倡建联购，使之有计划地统一配购；帮助私营棉商组织联营机构、克服过去经营中的投机性和育目性。采取上述措施的结果，缩小了某些私商投机余地，自十月下旬开始，稻谷、大米市价即首先稳落到接近国营公司牌价的水平。棉、粮比价和棉花地区差价亦趋于合理，棉价开始平稳。棉纱由于集中交易，申请购纱的须经严格审查后始准登记，因此使得争购现象大为减少。平均每天棉纱申请登记数和成交较比十月间成交情况不正常时减少百分之五十左右。每件纱价稳定在六百三十五万元左右。截至本月十八日为止，该市粮、花、纱、布等主要物资的市价与牌价都已大体持平，趋势稳定。而市场交易则依然活跃，以本月上旬和十月下旬成交量相较：稻谷增加百分之二十五点六，大米增加百分之五十一，小麦增加百分之八十五，桐油增加百分之十七。
    【新华社西安二十六日电】西安市物价自十月中旬以来曾一度发生不稳的现象，经国家贸易机关和人民银行作及时措施后，现已回复稳定。
    自上月中旬开始，西安市某些不明大义的商人，看到秋收以来市场交易活跃，妄想乘机囤积，哄抬物价，因此西安市场一时曾呈现不稳之势，面粉、棉布等主要商品的销货量不正常地剧增。小麦和棉纱价格也随之上升。
    为了坚决贯彻稳定物价的政策，西安市工商行政部门、国营贸易公司、人民银行即协同一致，实行了稳定物价的若干措施：国营贸易公司掌握原定牌价，大力抛售布匹、食米、面粉、食盐等，其中仅由于抛售食盐所回笼的货币每天平均数即较十一月一日增加十倍左右。人民银行则自十一月七日开始加强管制国家机关的现金，银行存款余额因之逐日增加，十一月八日比六日增加百分之三十三点四，十日又比八日增加百分之四十二点一。工商行政部门也加强了市场管理，如棉纱由国营花纱布公司协同各纱厂组成联销机构，有计划地配售给各布厂，保证生产者得到平价纱支；同时并登记所有纱商和存纱户，对于非营业户的存纱一律限期售出。此外，工商领导机关并加强各行业的管理，严禁不按规定跳行跳业等非法经营的投机行为。上述措施促使工商业者认识到政府稳定物价的正确政策，争购现象日渐减少，各货价格走向稳定。如十一月七日到十日三天内，面粉、布匹、火柴等比七日以前平均回跌了百分之三点五。国营贸易公司的销货量也有很大变化，从十一月七日到十三日，在原牌价水平上，面粉销售量下降百分之八十，各种布匹销售量下降百分之六十五，开始恢复正常状态。
    现在西安市国家贸易机关正在继续采取各种有效办法和掌握雄厚物资，以巩固物价稳定。
