　　Herdsmen of the Kang-Tibetan Plateau
    Qiangong
　　Crossing over the Zheduo Mountain, which is more than 4,000 meters above sea level not far from Kangding, and heading west, grasslands appear with thousands upon thousands of cattle and sheep, and scattered tents. Tibetan girls herding cattle and sheep constantly emit melodious mountain songs, and the mountain songs ripple through the distant mountains and deep valleys. This is the nomadic scenery on the Xikang Plateau.
　　From Qianning in the east, to Shiqu and Baiyu in the northwest, and Lihua and Ba'an in the south, countless pastoral areas are scattered, and the people on the cattle farms live a nomadic life of following the water and grass all year round. "Wearing cattle, living with cattle, eating cattle," they cannot live without cattle and sheep for a single day. They sew one or two sheepskin coats every year, wearing new ones in the severe winter and old ones in summer and autumn. Cattle hides are used to make Tibetan boots, and lambskin and fox skins are used to make hats. All they eat comes from cattle and sheep; milk, butter, cheese dregs, yogurt, beef, and mutton have become their daily necessities. Surplus butter is exchanged for highland barley, zanba, salt, tea, and other daily necessities. If they raise few cattle and have many people, they have to hunt wild animals to subsidize their families. The herdsmen have no houses, and all live in tents. The tents are made of felt. They shear sheep once a year, twist the wool into threads, and weave it into felt. Such tents do not leak even in heavy rain. The ropes for pulling up the tents are made of yak hair and cowhide. Within Xikang, mountains and ridges crisscross, and transporting goods relies on cattle and horses. Tibetan people, regardless of men or women, have excellent riding skills. Without horses, they cannot move, and every household has to feed one or two horses.
　　In the daily work of the herdsmen, although there is no clear division of labor between men and women, according to custom, women herd, milk, and extract butter, while men drive cattle for transportation.
　　The cattle and sheep on the pasture are grazed separately in different areas throughout the year, and the pastures for each season must be prepared in advance. In the cold winter when it snows, the livestock are driven to warmer areas. When the mountains are covered with ice and snow, the cattle and sheep in the pastoral areas still forage for grass roots in the ice and snow to satisfy their hunger. Livestock also die of starvation because they have no grass to eat, especially the herdsmen who live in higher altitudes. They know to cut grass and store materials, but due to lack of manpower, they cannot store fodder. Pastures are extremely important to the herdsmen. For example, the herdsman Zashi Robo from Ganzi originally grazed in Zhanhua, but because there was no pasture there, he moved to the Luoguo Liangzi of the Mashu Tusi family. People on the cattle farm often quarrel and fight because grazing crosses pasture boundaries. For example, the boundary between Ase Ma Village in Luhuo and Yuke Township in Daofu has caused many disputes and fights due to boundary issues. As a result, the herdsmen of Ase Ma Village were expelled to Kaniang Village in the back mountain of Zhuwo.
　　The herdsmen's breeding management of livestock is extremely extensive. Every morning, they drive the cattle to the grassland, and in the evening, they drive them back to the tent area, gather them, and tie them to ropes in fixed positions, without giving them any feed. Before grazing in the morning and after tethering in the evening, they squeeze the milk. Dairy cows lick salt every morning, and the rest of the cattle are given salt once a year, about two taels. Good horses can be given four or two taels of salt per month.
　　What the herdsmen worry about most is livestock diseases, especially true rinderpest. The herdsmen have no way to cure it, and they often watch hundreds of cattle die in a short period of time. Fifteen-year-old Lanzhu Zhima told the reporter: Cattle are too important to us. The death of a cow is like the death of a person, and the whole family will be worried.
　　Herdsmen on the cattle farms were despised before liberation. Han chauvinists called them "cattle farm kids." In addition to paying pasture taxes, they sometimes had to offer butter and unpaid labor. The Kuomintang reactionaries often forcibly sent errands to the cattle farms, and the poor herdsmen had no reward for herding for others. Even Zashi Robo from Luoguo Liangzi moved from Zhanhua to Ganzi, but still had to go to Zhanhua to work as a servant. Therefore, the life of the general herdsmen is very hard.
　　After liberation, the People's Government, under certain conditions, gradually solved the problem of livestock epidemic diseases and pasture problems in the pasture according to the pasture conditions. The development of animal husbandry on the Kang-Tibetan Plateau is unlimited.

　　康藏高原的牧民
    钳工
    越过离康定不远海拔四千多公尺的折多山，再向西去，草原上出现了成千成百的牛群羊群和稀稀落落的帐幕。放牧的藏族少女，不时地发出悠扬的山歌，山歌荡漾在远山深谷，这就是西康高原上的游牧风光。
    东起乾宁，西北至石渠、白玉，南到理化、巴安，散布着无数的牧区，牛场上的人，便终年过着逐水草而居的游牧生活。“穿牛、住牛、吃牛”，他们是一天也离不了牛羊的。每年缝上一、两套羊皮袄，严冬时穿新的，夏、秋穿旧的。牛皮做藏靴，羊羔皮、野狐皮做帽子。他们吃的，全在牛、羊身上，牛奶、酥油、奶渣、酸奶、牛羊肉，成了他们的生活必需品。多余的酥油，换取青稞、糌粑、食盐、茶叶和其他的日用品。如果养牛少、人口多，便得猎取野兽补助家用。牧民们没有庄房，全住帐篷。帐篷是用毛毡做的，每年剪羊毛一次，搓成线条，编成毛毡，这样的帐篷下大雨也不透水。扯帐篷的绳索，是用牛毛和牛皮做的。西康境内，山岭纵横，驮运物品，都要靠牛马，藏族人民不论男女，骑术精良，离开了马，便不能行动，每家都得喂上马一、二匹。
    牧民日常的工作，男女虽然没有明确的分工，按照习惯，女的放牧、挤奶、取酥油。男的赶牛驮运。
    牧场上的牛羊，一年四季分开地区放牧，每季的草场都得事先准备好，寒冬下雪，便把牲畜赶到较暖的地带。冰雪封山，牧区的牛羊，仍在冰雪中觅草根充饥，牲畜因为没草吃，饿死的也有，特别是住在海拔较高地带的牧民，牲畜每年饿死的更多，牧民们虽然知道割草存料，但因人力缺乏，不能储存草料。草场对于牧民是极端重要的，像甘孜的牧民扎希罗博，原在瞻化放牧，因为那边没有草场，便移到麻书土司家的罗锅梁子。牛场上的人，往往因放牧越过草场界线，发生争吵械斗的。像炉霍阿色马村和道孚鱼科乡连界，因界务纠纷，发生械斗多次，结果阿色马村的牧民被驱逐到朱倭后山的卡娘村。
    牧民对牲畜的饲养管理极为粗放，每早驱牛上草原，傍晚就赶回帐幕地区，集合拴在固定地位的绳上，不给任何饲料，早晨放牧前，晚上拴定后，即挤取乳汁，乳牛每晨舐吮食盐，其余牛只，年给食盐一次，约二两，好马每月可给盐四两或二两。
    牧民们最担心的是牲畜的疾病，特别是真性牛瘟，牧民毫无办法救治，往往眼看着成百的牛在短时期内死去。十五岁的兰珠智麻告诉记者：牛对咱们太重要了，死了一条牛，就像死了一个人一样，全家都会发愁。
    牛场上的牧民，在解放以前是被贱视的。大汉族主义者叫他们“牛厂娃”，他们除缴纳牧地税外，有时还得献出酥油和无偿的劳役。国民党反动派经常在牛场强行派差，贫苦的牧民给人家代牧，也没有什么报酬。连罗锅梁子的扎希罗博，从瞻化搬到甘孜，可是还要到瞻化去当差，因此，一般牧民的生活是很苦的。
    解放后，人民政府在一定的条件下根据牧场情况，逐步地解决牧场中牲畜的流行性疾病及牧草问题，则康藏高原畜牧业的发展是不可限量的。
