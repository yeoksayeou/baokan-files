　　[Xinhua News Agency, somewhere in northern Korea, 23rd] According to the Korean Central News Agency: The Central Committee of the Korean Fatherland United Democratic Front held a meeting on the 19th. At the meeting, General Kim Il-sung delivered a report on the current situation and the tasks of the Fatherland United Democratic Front. After discussing this report, the meeting adopted a letter to all Korean people. The letter stated:

　　It has been four months since the heinous American imperialists launched a barbaric war of aggression against our country and people. During this period, the American imperialists in Korea, regardless of heavy losses, have repeatedly reinforced their forces and continued to wage a war to massacre the Korean people.

　　The sinister purpose of the American imperialists is to vainly attempt to annex our Korea today, seize the People's Republic of China in their poisonous hands tomorrow, turn all Asian nations into slaves of their colonies the day after, and then dominate the entire world.

　　Therefore, the struggle waged by the Korean people against American imperialism is not only to safeguard the independence and honor of our country, but also a link in the worldwide struggle for freedom and happiness, and a link in the struggle to defend the peace and security of all mankind.

　　Our young People's Army, which was founded only two years ago, encountered a sudden attack by one of the most powerful and brutal armies in the world—the American imperialist invading army. However, our People's Army displayed unparalleled heroism and dedication, dealt a heavy blow to the American imperialist invading army, and caused it to suffer significant losses in manpower and equipment.

　　The American imperialist bandits, attempting to turn our country into their colony and seize world hegemony, mobilized a large number of land, sea, and air forces to launch repeated and powerful attacks on our People's Army. Our People's Army had to temporarily retreat. The enemy has occupied most of our country's territory, and millions of our compatriots are living under the unprecedentedly brutal oppression of the enemy.

　　The American imperialist armed invaders and their running dogs, the traitorous Li Seung-man clique, are destroying the democratic rights and freedoms that the Korean people have gained in the five years since liberation, as well as the achievements of the democratic reforms, and cruelly massacring thousands upon thousands of outstanding sons and daughters of the Korean people.

　　However, the entire Korean people, united as one and rising up to fight for the independence and freedom of the country, will never yield to the barbaric American imperialist aggressors. In this just struggle, we Korean people are not isolated. We have the sympathy and support of millions of people from all over the world.

　　On November 4, 1950, the democratic parties of China, led by the Communist Party of China, issued a joint declaration supporting the Chinese people's resistance against American aggression and aid to Korea to protect their homes and defend their country. All Korean people deeply appreciate and fervently support and cheer this historic declaration, which proves the further strengthening of the fraternal friendship between the Chinese and Korean peoples.

　　Today, the sinister plan of the American imperialists to conquer our country and use it as a military base for attacking the People's Republic of China has been clearly exposed. The Chinese People's Volunteer Army is fighting side by side with the Korean people on our Korean land to oppose foreign plunderers.

　　The heroic Korean People's Army, together with the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, has achieved initial and great victories. Now the situation on the front has become favorable to us. Behind enemy lines, armed guerrilla forces composed of thousands upon thousands of our most outstanding sons and daughters are launching fierce activities and continuing to attack the enemy.

　　Under this changing situation, the Central Committee of the Fatherland United Democratic Front calls on all compatriots in our country, and all members of patriotic political parties and social organizations, regardless of political views, beliefs, and property, to further unite and rise up together for the sacred war of the fatherland.

　　All Korean people should be united as one and fully support the cause of assisting our People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army.

　　People temporarily in enemy-occupied areas should provide material and spiritual assistance to the heroic guerrilla forces, and all people who can take up arms should join the guerrilla forces.

　　We should quickly restore the roads, bridges, and communication networks that have been destroyed by bombing in order to assist the advance of the People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army.

　　In the face of our just struggle for final victory, there are still many difficulties, but we must overcome them and we will certainly be able to overcome them. In this glorious war of national liberation, we should dedicate all our strength to the great cause of the entire nation for victory.

　　朝鲜祖国战线号召朝鲜全体人民
    支援人民军和中国志愿部队   
    感激并支持我各民主党派联合宣言
    【新华社二十三日讯】据朝鲜中央通讯社朝鲜北部某地讯：朝鲜祖国统一民主主义战线中央委员会于十九日举行会议。会上，金日成将军作了关于目前形势和祖国统一民主主义战线的任务的报告。会议在讨论了这一报告后，通过了告朝鲜全体人民书。告人民书略称：
    自从凶恶的美帝国主义对我们的祖国和人民发动野蛮的侵略战争以来，已经有四个月了。在这期间，美帝国主义者在朝鲜，不顾付出重大的损失，重行增强兵力，继续进行杀戮朝鲜人民的战争。
    美帝国主义者的凶恶目的，是妄想今天吞并我们朝鲜，明天将中华人民共和国握在其毒手里，后天使全亚洲各民族变成他们殖民地的奴隶，然后再霸占全世界。
    因此，朝鲜人民为反对美帝国主义所进行的斗争，不仅是为了维护我们祖国的独立和荣誉；而且是全世界为争取自由和幸福而斗争之一环，是为保卫全人类的和平与安全而斗争之一环。
    我们创建仅两年的年青的人民军，遇到了世界侵略军队中最强大横暴的军队之一——美帝国主义侵略军队的突然攻击，但是，我们的人民军发挥了无比的英勇和献身的精神，给了美帝国主义侵略军队以沉重的打击，并使它在有生力量和配备上遭受了重大的损失。
    力图把我们祖国沦为他们的殖民地并夺取世界霸权的美帝国主义强盗们，动员了大量陆、海、空军，向我们人民军屡次进行强力的攻击。我们人民军不得不暂时后退。敌人侵占了我们祖国的大部分领土，我们千百万的同胞兄弟姊妹们生活在敌人空前残暴的压迫之下。
    美帝国主义武装侵犯者及其走狗李承晚卖国匪帮，正在摧毁朝鲜人民在解放后五年中所得的民主权利和自由以及由于民主改革所得到的成果，残酷地屠杀了千千万万朝鲜人民的优秀儿女。
    但是，万众一心奋起为祖国的独立和自由而斗争的全朝鲜人民，是决不会向美帝国主义野蛮侵略者屈服的。在这正义的斗争中，我们朝鲜人民并不是孤立的。我们有着世界各国千百万人民的同情和支持。
    一九五○年十一月四日，以中国共产党为首的中国各民主党派，发表了拥护中国人民抗美援朝保家卫国的联合宣言。全朝鲜人民以深切的感激，狂热地支持和欢呼着这一证明中、朝人民的兄弟友谊进一步加强的历史性宣言。
    今天，美帝国主义者企图征服我们祖国，并以此做为进攻中华人民共和国的军事基地的阴险计划，已明白地暴露出来了。中国人民志愿部队为反对外国掠夺者，正和朝鲜人民在我们朝鲜土地上并肩作战。
    英勇的朝鲜人民军跟中国人民志愿部队一起，已取得了初步的巨大胜利。现在前线的形势已变得对我们有利了。在敌后，由我们千千万万最优秀的儿女所组成的武装游击队，正展开猛烈的活动，继续不断地攻击着敌人。
    祖国统一民主主义战线中央委员会在这种转变的形势下，号召我们祖国的全体同胞兄弟姊妹和全体爱国政党社会团体的党员和盟员们，不分政见、信仰和财产，进一步团结起来，共同为神圣的祖国战争而一致奋起。
    全体朝鲜人民应万众一心，全力展开对我们人民军和中国人民志愿部队的援助事业。
    暂时处于敌人占领地区的人民，应在物质、精神两方面援助英勇的游击队，凡是能够拿起武器的人民，都应参加游击队。
    我们应迅速恢复由于轰炸而被破坏的道路、桥梁、通讯联络网，以援助人民军和中国人民志愿部队的进击。
    在我们争取最后胜利的正义斗争面前，还有重重的困难，但是我们必须克服，而且一定能够克服的，我们在这光荣的祖国解放战争中，应将我们的全部力量，献给为争取胜利的全民族的伟大事业。
