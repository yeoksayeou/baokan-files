　　Over Seventy Lamas in Beijing
　　Oppose U.S. Imperialism's Sabotage of Peace

　　[This newspaper] Beijing dispatch – More than seventy lamas in Beijing held a current affairs forum on the 10th, expressing unanimous indignation at the U.S. imperialists' expansion of the war of aggression against Korea, which seriously threatens our country's security. Bain Delek, the Great Lama of Songzhu Temple, said: "We lamas hope for world peace. Now that U.S. imperialism is undermining world peace, we cannot but stand up to oppose it." An excited 70-year-old lama from Yonghe Temple, Mai Busang, said: "I have been a lama my whole life and have experienced many things. The reactionary governments of the past only told us to chant scriptures and did not allow us to know about national affairs. Now, with the People's Government, we lamas are also masters of the country. The flames of the U.S. imperialists' war have already reached our doorstep. Although I am old and cannot go to the front lines to fight, I can still contribute a little bit of strength in the rear." Zhang Batu, a lama from Huguo Temple, said: "We chant scriptures and pray for peace, which shows that we hope for peace. However, simply praying for peace will not drive back U.S. imperialism. We should take active action, work hard to assist the government in exposing special agent rumors, and report saboteurs to the government at any time." (Feng Wancai)

　　京市喇嘛七十余人
　　反对美帝破坏和平
    【本报讯】北京市喇嘛七十余人十日举行时事座谈会，对美帝扩大侵朝战争，严重威胁我国安全，一致表示愤慨。嵩祝寺大喇嘛白音得勒格尔说：“我们喇嘛是希望世界和平的，今天美帝国主义破坏世界和平，我们就不能不起来反对它。”雍和宫七十多岁的老喇嘛买布桑激动地说：“我当了一辈子喇嘛，经历过不少的事情。过去的反动政府只叫我们念经，不让我们知道国家大事，现在有了人民政府，我们喇嘛也是国家的主人了。美帝战争火焰已经烧到了我们的大门，我虽然年老不能到前线去打仗，还可以在后方出一点点力量。”护国寺喇嘛章巴图说：“我们念经祈求和平，说明我们是希望和平的；但光是祈求和平还不会把美帝国主义赶回去，我们应积极行动起来，努力协助政府揭穿特务谣言，随时向政府检举破坏分子。”（冯万才）
