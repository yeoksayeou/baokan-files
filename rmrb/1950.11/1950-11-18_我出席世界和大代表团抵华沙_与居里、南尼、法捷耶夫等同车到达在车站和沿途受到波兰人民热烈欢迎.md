In a sea of ​​various colored flags, there was a large red banner with the Chinese characters: "Long Live the Heroic Chinese People and Their Leader Mao Zedong." Guo Moruo said to the welcoming crowd at the station: "The British government prevented us from going to Sheffield, but the Polish government welcomed us to Warsaw. This shows the difference between a people's government and an anti-people's government, and it also shows the sharp opposition between the peace camp and the aggressive bloc. The Chinese people deeply realize that defending world peace is inseparable from resisting American aggression. We have brought the common will and firm determination of the Chinese people to unite with peace-loving people around the world to strive for world peace and oppose American aggression.

Most of the members of the Chinese delegation arrived in Warsaw on the 13th from Moscow, and another group led by Liu Ningyi also arrived here on the 14th. They were warmly welcomed by the Polish people along the way. At every station where the train stopped, Polish people, men and women, old and young, gathered to applaud, sing, and shout "Peace," cheering for Stalin and Mao Zedong. Enthusiastic and excited Polish youths squeezed to the front to shake hands with the Chinese representatives, present them with flowers, and exchange their badges for Mao Zedong commemorative badges. Many people took out autograph books and asked the representatives to sign their names. All of this continued until the moment the train continued to move.

Xinhua News Agency, 17th. TASS, Warsaw, 15th: The entire city of Warsaw is preparing for the opening of the Second World Peace Congress as if preparing for a grand festival.

　　我出席世界和大代表团抵华沙
    与居里、南尼、法捷耶夫等同车到达在车站和沿途受到波兰人民热烈欢迎
    【新华社华沙十七日电】中国出席世界和大代表团团长郭沫若和团员钱俊瑞等一行七人，于十五日自布拉格抵达华沙。同车前来者有约里奥——居里，南尼，法捷耶夫，爱伦堡及其他许多出席和平大会的代表。中国代表和其他各国代表在华沙车站受到了数千人的欢迎，欢迎群众高举着斯大林和毛泽东以及其他各国人民领袖的画像。在一片各色旗帜的海中，有一幅大红色的长条标语，上面用中国字写着：“英勇的中国人民和他们的领袖毛泽东万岁”。郭沫若在车站对欢迎群众讲话说：“英国政府阻止我们到设菲尔德去，但波兰政府却欢迎我们到华沙来。这就表明了人民的政府和反人民的政府之间的不同，也表明了和平阵营和侵略集团之间的尖锐对立。中国人民深深认识到：保卫世界和平与抵抗美国的侵略是分不开的。我们带来了中国人民联合全世界爱好和平的人民共同为争取世界和平反对美国侵略而斗争的共同意志和坚定决心。
    中国代表团团员大部分系于十三日从莫斯科抵达华沙，另由刘宁一率领的一部分亦已于十四日抵此。他们沿途受到波兰人民的热烈欢迎。在火车停留的每一个站上，男男女女，老老幼幼的波兰人民聚集拢来鼓掌，歌唱，高呼“和平”，欢呼斯大林和毛泽东。热情激动的波兰青年人挤到前面来，争着和中国代表们握手，把鲜花献给他们，并用自己的徽章交换毛泽东纪念章。很多人拿出了纪念册，要代表们签名。这一切一直到火车继续开动的一瞬间还在继续着。
    【新华社十七日讯】塔斯社华沙十五日讯：华沙全市像准备迎接大节日一样地筹备第二届世界保卫和平大会的揭幕。全城每所房子都用旗帜和标语装饰起来。商店的橱窗里、公寓的窗子上，满都是彩色的标语牌，上面都写着“和平”的字样，并且画着和平之鸽。大会会场内可容三千余人的大厅，已装好全套的无线电装置。代表们将能听到大会讲演的七种语言的译文。
