American-Chiang Kai-shek Bandit Special Agents Spread Rumors and Sabotage
Anti-Rumor Struggle Carried Out in Various Places
Launch Current Affairs Propaganda to Smash Bandit Special Agent Rumors

[News from this newspaper] In response to the increasingly rampant rumor-mongering and sabotage activities of American-Chiang Kai-shek bandit special agents, public security organs and the people in various places are launching a struggle against rumors. Since American imperialism expanded its war of aggression against Korea, American-Chiang Kai-shek bandit special agents hidden in various parts of China have, under the direction of American imperialism, systematically fabricated various rumors, incited and deceived the masses, disrupted social order, and sabotaged production, using all kinds of vile and shameless activities to harm the Chinese people.

The rumors spread by special agents and bad elements in various places are roughly of the following types: 1. Propagating the Third World War and American atomic bombs, using this to intimidate the masses. 2. Distorting the various policies of the People's Government, and provoking relations between the government and the people, and between working cadres and the masses, in order to undermine production and construction and various tasks. 3. Using the superstition and backwardness of the masses to create all kinds of magical ghosts and monsters to deceive and fool the masses.

Public security organs and the people in cities such as Shenyang, Shanghai, Beijing, and rural areas of Shaanxi have continuously exposed and reported the rumor-mongering and sabotage activities of bandit special agents and bad elements. Shenyang City held a confession meeting for rumor-mongering and sabotage elements on the 20th of last month at the Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Plant, attended by more than 1,000 employees. The rumor-mongering and sabotage element Li Dehui confessed on the spot his rumor-mongering and sabotage activities. The saboteur Shan Deshun confessed that he shouted "Air raid, lights out!" on the street one night to scare the masses. The rumor-mongering criminal Zhang Weifu, who was uncovered by the Public Security Bureau, was originally an intelligence agent of Chiang Kai-shek's 207th Division. After liberation, he mixed into the factory, pretending to be active, and recently began to carry out large-scale rumor-mongering and sabotage activities.

At the economic defense meetings held by six factories, including the Husi People's Printing Factory in Shanghai, the bandit special agent Xia Xisheng confessed that their special agent organization had strengthened rumor-mongering after the outbreak of the Korean War. Special agents of the bandit Ding Zhipan system spread rumors and enticed a small number of backward workers to join the bandit special agent organization. For example, a landlord in Zhangqiao Township, Pudong, took advantage of the opportunity when township cadres went to the district to rectify their work style, and spread rumors to threaten farmers to withdraw their land. A small number of capitalists and merchants in Shanghai, affected by rumors, began to feel uneasy about running factories and doing business again.

In the 15th district of the Beijing suburbs, special agent elements spread rumors everywhere, saying that there were "white-haired ghosts," "long-tongued ghosts," and "flower-snatchers" (i.e., a type of swindler selling fake medicines), causing panic among the masses. Some farmers stopped working early and went home before dark. Elementary school students did not dare to walk alone after school. Individual households dared not sleep at night, and even bricked up their windows, which harmed rural order and production. Once, in Wulituo Village, someone shouted at the east end of the village before dark: "I saw a white-haired ghost!" Some people at the west end of the village came out with poles to fight. Later, it was discovered that the people who came out to fight and the person who shouted were all from Yiguan Tao. It turned out that they were acting according to a plan. The local Public Security Branch, based on reports from the masses, captured six special agent rumor-mongering elements, thoroughly exposed their rumor-mongering activities among the masses, and widely publicized and explained the situation. Only then did the farmers realize that they had been fooled by counter-revolutionary rumors.

Launch Propaganda Struggle
Smash Special Agent Rumors

In order to further smash special agent rumors, various places have launched various propaganda activities. The trade unions of various factories in Shenyang have gone deep into the employees and their families to carry out current affairs propaganda and education. The amateur propaganda team of the Shenyang Woolen Mill Trade Union went to the homes of employees to organize chats, first letting the family members talk about the various rumors they had heard, and then conducting current affairs education based on the rumors and the family members' ideological situation. The Municipal Federation of Trade Unions also organized family entertainment evenings, performing current affairs skits to educate family members about anti-rumor and fire and anti-special agent work. After holding employee meetings and making current affairs reports, the Shenyang Rubber No. 7 Factory organized propaganda mobilizers to go deep into the workshops to carry out current affairs propaganda, understand the ideological situation of employees, and collect various questions, which were then answered and reported by special personnel. As a result, the employees had a correct understanding of current affairs, eliminated ideological concerns, and turned hatred into strength. Everyone's enthusiasm for production was even greater. For example, the molding workshop of the factory recently created a new collective record, increasing the production of rubber shoes from 3,000 pairs to 3,565 pairs.

Based on the propaganda activities in various places and past experience, there are several ways to eliminate rumors: (1) In places where rumors are prevalent, it is first necessary to mobilize the masses to cooperate with the public security organs to resolutely investigate, report, and punish rumor-mongering and sabotage elements. (2) Carry out current affairs and scientific education in a planned way. This first requires educating cadres or propagandists, who then conduct propaganda to the masses through amateur schools, people's schools, representative meetings, and other mass gatherings. (3) Local newspapers, including factory tabloids, wall newspapers, and blackboards, should provide timely current affairs propaganda materials suitable for the masses.

　　美蒋匪特造谣破坏
    各地进行反谣言斗争
    展开时事宣传，粉碎匪特谣言
    【本报讯】针对美蒋匪特日益猖狂的造谣破坏活动，各地公安机关及人民群众正在展开反谣言斗争。自美帝国主义扩大侵略朝鲜战争后，隐藏在中国各地的美蒋匪特，在美帝国主义的指使下，有计划地制造各种谣言，煽惑欺骗群众，扰乱社会秩序，破坏生产，以各种卑鄙无耻的活动，来损害中国人民。
    各地特务、坏分子所造的谣言大致有这样几种：一、宣传第三次世界大战和美国原子弹，以此恐吓群众。二、歪曲人民政府的各种政策，挑拨政府与人民、工作干部和群众的关系，来破坏生产建设和各种工作。三、利用群众的迷信和落后，制造各种神奇鬼怪，来欺骗愚弄群众。
    在沈阳、上海、北京等城市及陕西各地农村的公安机关及人民群众，不断地揭露和检举了匪特及坏分子的造谣破坏活动。沈阳市于上月二十日在沈阳第一机器厂召开一千余职工参加的造谣破坏分子坦白大会，造谣破坏分子李德惠当场坦白他造谣破坏的情形。破坏分子单德顺坦白说，他在某天夜晚在街上喊叫：“防空，熄灯”吓唬群众。被公安局破获的造谣犯张维福原是蒋匪二○七师的谍报队员，解放后混入工厂，平常假装积极，近日即大肆进行造谣、破坏活动。
    上海市在沪西人民印刷厂等六厂召开的经济保卫大会上，匪特夏淅声坦白他们的特务组织在朝鲜战争爆发后，就加强造谣。匪丁治磐系统的特务在大放谣言后并诱惑了少数落后工人参加了匪特组织。又如浦东张桥乡一个地主，趁乡干部到区里整风的机会，大造谣言，威胁农民抽田。上海少数资本家及商人，因受谣言的影响，办工厂、作生意又开始不安心了。
    在北京郊区十五区一带，特务分子到处造谣，说出了什么“白毛鬼”、“长舌鬼”、“拍花的”（即某种卖假药的骗子）等各种荒谬的谣言，弄得群众恐慌不安。有的农民天黑前就早早收工回家。小学生放学回家，不敢单独行走。个别家户夜里不敢睡，甚至把窗子都砌起来，使农村秩序及生产受到了危害。有一次在五里坨村，天黑前村东头有一人喊：“看见白毛鬼了！”村西头就有些拿着杆子出来打，后来发现出来打的人和喊的人都是一贯道，原来他们是有计划的行动。当地公安分局根据群众的揭发，捕获了六个特务造谣分子，把他的造谣活动在群众中彻底揭穿并广为宣传解释以后，农民始知道上了反革命谣言的当。
    展开宣传斗争
    粉碎特务造谣
    各地为进一步粉碎特务造谣，展开了各种宜传工作。沈阳市各工厂工会，曾深入职工和职工家属中，展开时事宣传教育。沈阳毛织厂工会的业余宣传队，曾分头到工属家中组织漫谈，先让家属谈出所听到的各种谣言，然后针对谣言及家属的思想情况，进行时事教育。市政工会并组织家属娱乐晚会，表演时事短剧，向家属进行反谣言及防火、防特教育。沈阳橡胶七厂在召开职工大会，进行时事报告后，再组织宣传鼓动员深入各车间，进行时事宣传，了解职工思想情况，搜集各种问题，然后由专人作解答报告。因此，使职工对时事有了正确的认识，消除了思想顾虑，把仇恨变成了力量，大家生产劲头更大了，如该厂成型工间最近创造了集体新纪录，使胶鞋生产由三千双提高到三千五百六十五双。
    根据各地的宣传活动及过去的经验，对如何肃清谣言，有这样几种办法：（一）在谣言流行的地方，首先要发动群众配合公安机关，坚决追究、检举和惩处造谣破坏分子。（二）有计划地进行时事及科学教育，这首先要教育干部或宣传员，然后由他们通过业余学校、民校、代表会等各种群众场合，向群众进行宣传。（三）各地报纸，包括工厂小报、墙报、黑板报，要及时供给适合群众的时事宣传材料。
