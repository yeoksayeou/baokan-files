　　Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 22nd - Hundreds of thousands of militiamen in Northeast China are vigilantly defending the motherland's borders and local order. Among the militia organizations in various places are veterans and honored soldiers who have been tempered in long wars, guerrilla fighters who were active behind enemy lines during the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation, stretcher-bearers who once supported the People's Liberation Army and possessed certain combat experience, and activists who emerged during the land reform and production campaigns. Since the U.S. imperialists expanded their war of aggression, they have been mobilized intensely, gripping the weapons in their hands, and universally strengthening the joint defense system in the vast area.
　　The militiamen along the Yalu River, Tumen River, Yellow Sea, and Bohai Sea in the southern part of the region are even more nervously and closely guarding the borders of the motherland. In the Yanbian area of ​​Jilin Province, militiamen are on guard duty everywhere, day and night. Militiamen in counties such as Helong and Antu have also set up many observation posts on the border. Militiamen in the Changbai Mountain area of ​​Liaodong Province are spread throughout the Yalu River and at the foot of Changbai Mountain. Militiamen in the three counties of Changbai, Linjiang, and Ji'an along the river have also formed river defense patrol teams, set up mobile sentry posts and intelligence groups, and launched a mass river defense movement. Militiamen in villages in counties such as Suizhong, Xingcheng, Jinxi, and Panshan in Liaoxi Province are actively cooperating with public security troops, patrolling day and night along the 600-mile-long national coastline.
　　Militiamen in villages along railway lines in various provinces have organized road protection committees or road protection groups. According to incomplete statistics, in Jilin Province alone, more than 23,500 militiamen participated in road protection groups. Seventy-three of them have been awarded the honorary title of road protection model in their work of guarding transportation lines. Road protection committees and road protection groups in various villages in Liaoxi Province have also established a responsibility system, implementing village militiamen's responsibility for sections and carrying out patrols back and forth. Militiamen in villages along the railway in counties such as Haicheng, Fengcheng, Liuhe, and Tonghua in Liaodong Province, in cooperation with the self-defense forces, are guarding every bridge and every section of railway day and night. Among them, the militiamen and self-defense forces in Jiguan Mountain, Tangshan and other places have been praised by the local railway bureau.

　　东北数十万人民武装
    警惕地保卫祖国边防
    紧握武器布岗鸭绿江边长白山麓
    【新华社沈阳二十二日电】东北数十万民兵正在警惕地保卫着祖国边防和地方秩序。在各地民兵组织中，有久经战争锻炼的退伍军人和荣誉军人，有曾经在抗日战争和解放战争中活跃敌后的游击队员，有曾经支援人民解放军并具备一定战斗经验的担架队员，有在土地改革和生产运动中涌现的积极分子。他们自美帝国主义扩大侵略战争以后都紧张地动员起来，紧握手中的武器，普遍地加强了辽阔地区内的联防制度。
    南部沿鸭绿江、图们江、黄海、渤海一带的民兵们，更加紧张和严密地守卫着祖国边境。吉林省延边地区，不论白天黑夜，到处都有民兵站岗放哨。和龙、安图等县民兵并在国境线上设置了许多了望哨。辽东省长白山地区民兵遍布在鸭绿江和长白山麓。沿江的长白、临江、辑安三县民兵并纷纷组成江防巡视小组，设立游动哨和情报组，展开了群众性的江防运动。辽西省绥中、兴城、锦西、盘山等县各村民兵，都积极地配合公安部队，昼夜巡视在长达六百余里的国境海岸线上。
    各省铁路沿线地区各村庄的民兵们，都组织了护路委员会或护路小组。据不完全统计，仅吉林一省即有二万三千五百余民兵参加护路小组。他们在警卫交通线的工作中，有七十三人得到了护路模范的光荣称号。辽西省各村护路委员会和护路小组并建立了责任制，实行各村民兵分段负责，来回巡查。辽东省海城、凤城、柳河、通化等县沿铁路各区村的民兵们，在自卫队的配合下，日夜防护着每一座桥梁和每一段铁路。其中鸡冠山、汤山等地的民兵和自卫队曾受到当地铁路局的表扬。
