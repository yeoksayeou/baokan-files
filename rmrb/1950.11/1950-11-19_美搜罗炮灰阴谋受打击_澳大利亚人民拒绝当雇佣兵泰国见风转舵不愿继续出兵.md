　　Xinhua News Agency, 16th Dispatch: The Australian people are refusing to be cannon fodder for the American war of aggression against Korea. According to a Sydney dispatch on the 14th from the Dentong News Agency: Since Australia began its campaign to recruit mercenaries to fight in Korea, it has spent a full six weeks, and the total number of people who have signed up is less than four hundred. Herring, the person in charge of recruiting mercenaries to fight in Korea, said sadly: This result is "greatly disappointing."

    Other puppet countries, seeing the unfavorable situation in the war of aggression against Korea, are now making excuses to avoid sending more troops to die for the United States. According to a dispatch from the Kuomintang's Central News Agency: The *Bangkok Forum*, a mouthpiece of Thailand's Luang Phibunsongkhram, revealed that the Thai authorities, who had originally promised to send 4,000 troops but actually only sent 1,200, are now considering keeping the other 3,000 troops they were preparing to send to Korea in the country for the time being. The reason given is: "Thailand needs to keep all its troops stationed at home to protect its national sovereignty."

　　美搜罗炮灰阴谋受打击
    澳大利亚人民拒绝当雇佣兵泰国见风转舵不愿继续出兵
    【新华社十六日讯】澳大利亚人民拒绝为美国侵朝战争当炮灰。据电通社悉尼十四日讯：澳大利亚自从开始招募赴朝作战的雇佣兵运动以来，整整花了六星期的时间，报名参军的总共不到四百人，招募雇佣兵去朝鲜作战的负责人赫林悲哀地说：这个结果“大大令人失望”。
    另外一些仆从国家看到侵朝战争形势不利，现在正制造借口不愿再出兵替美国送死。据国民党中央社讯：泰国銮披汶的喉舌《曼谷论坛报》透露：原来答应出四千人而实际上只派去了一千二百人的泰国当局，现在正考虑将它准备开到朝鲜去的另外三千名军队暂留国内。理由据说是：“泰国需将其所有军队留驻本土，以保护其本国主权。”
