　　Changsha, Xi'an and other places, and all sectors of Henan Province
    Conduct current affairs study on resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, directing patriotic enthusiasm to practical work
    Conduct condolences, production competitions, and prevent bandits and special agents.
    [Report from this newspaper] People from all walks of life in cities such as Changsha, Xi'an, and Haikou, and various circles in Henan Province are conducting current affairs studies, directing their patriotic enthusiasm for resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea towards practical work, effectively supporting the Korean people and the Chinese People's Volunteers.

    After studying current affairs, people from all strata in Changsha have universally raised their political awareness and have expressed their determination to resist U.S. aggression and defend their homes and country through practical actions. Workers have established labor discipline, issued challenge letters, and launched patriotic production competitions between factories and between groups. 15,000 dockworkers, rickshaw pullers, barge haulers, and other workers, who previously had some internal disunity, have also guaranteed to strengthen unity, prevent bandits and special agents, and do a good job in transportation. In addition to intensifying regular classes, students throughout the city have added courses such as long-distance running, grenade throwing, and shooting in some schools to intensify training. Cadres in various organs have raised their vigilance to prevent sabotage by special agents. The Federation of Industry and Commerce and industries such as oil, salt, cotton yarn, etc., have guaranteed not to engage in speculation and to actively pay taxes. People from all walks of life have also written letters, donated money, and donated goods to comfort the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Forces.
    In the current affairs study at Northwest University in Xi'an, erroneous ideas that existed among some teachers and students, such as not caring about politics and worshipping the productive capacity of the United States, were criticized. More than 1,200 teachers and students from the entire school went to Xi'an City to conduct propaganda against U.S. aggression and aid to Korea. All the residents of Zhuba Street in Xi'an held a current affairs forum, unanimously expressing that they would intensify public security work and prevent bandits and special agents.
    Various organs, organizations, and schools in Haikou City have also held current affairs forums and discussion meetings.
    Teachers and students of the Jimei School in Tong'an County, Fujian Province, expressed at the anniversary memorial service for Principal Huang and more than 20 others who were bombed to death by U.S.-Chiang bandit aircraft: Blood debts must be repaid with blood. Students from the Civil Engineering Department of Xiamen University formed a "construction corps" and prepared to go to Korea to repair bridges and roads for the Korean People's Army.
    Jinan, northern Anhui, Wuhan and other places are also conducting activities to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea in conjunction with current affairs studies. Students in Jinan and Wuhan wrote letters of condolence to the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army. Bethune Medical College and other schools in Jinan have also established medical teams and blood transfusion teams.
    [Another dispatch] People from all walks of life in Henan Province continue to be swept up in the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea.
    Through the study of current affairs, students in various parts of Henan have further recognized the aggressive conspiracies of U.S. imperialism and have actively launched a movement to resist U.S. aggression and defend their homes and country. Many students from Henan University have requested to join the Chinese People's Volunteers. Students at Kaifeng High School organized a volunteer fighting team named after the famous Soviet combat hero "Matrosov." The Beicang Girls' Middle School formed a "Bethune" rescue team. They are all prepared to serve on the Korean front immediately when necessary. In addition to intensifying their studies of regular subjects, male and female students in various places are also learning military, air defense, and medical care knowledge in their spare time, and are actively going to the streets and rural areas to conduct current affairs propaganda.
    Under the leadership of trade unions, employees in various parts of Henan Province are enthusiastically conducting current affairs studies and launching patriotic production competitions. Employees of the Pulin Electric Company in Kaifeng City have challenged employees throughout the province. Employees of more than 50 factories, enterprises, and industries in Zhengzhou have joined this competition movement. Liu Xiaoxian, a foundry worker at the Kaifeng Repair Factory who is responsible for making horseshoe-shaped irons for track accessories, has increased his output by about 100% since the start of the production competition.
    Citizens in various cities have also conducted current affairs studies.
    People from all walks of life in Kaifeng City held a rally of more than 1,000 people to oppose U.S. aggression. At the meeting, they unanimously expressed their determination to resolutely defend the motherland and support the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Anti-American and Aid-Korea Volunteer Army who are engaged in the war of liberation against U.S. imperialist aggression. Representatives of the industrial and commercial circles in Zhengzhou also held a forum. They expressed their determination to improve their operations, assist the people's government in stabilizing prices, and actively pay taxes as a practical action to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea.
    Farmers in various places have also conducted current affairs studies in various forms. Farmers' representatives from sixteen villages in Boniu Township and Lizhai Township in Qi County jointly held an anti-aggression rally, proposing the slogan of intensifying production, actively handing over public grain, strengthening national power, and defending a good life.
