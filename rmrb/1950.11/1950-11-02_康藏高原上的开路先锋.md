Pioneers on the Kangzang Plateau
    Zhao Shenying Wang Shijin

The eastern part of Xikang belongs to the Kangzang Plateau, known as the "Roof of the World." Here, the Daxue Mountains, the main range of the Hengduan Mountains, run north-south, with the Erlang Mountains rising 3,200 meters above sea level and the Zheduo Mountains rising 4,700 meters above sea level, standing tall to the east and west. Between these snow-capped mountains are many rapid rivers and countless deep canyons. To the west of the Daxue Mountains is a vast grassland. The Sichuan-Xikang and Kang-Qing highways crawl across this snowy mountain grassland plateau.

In the past, these two highways existed only as red lines on maps and were completely impassable. Now, the engineering corps of the People's Liberation Army Southwest Military Region and the worker brothers, under the call to support the advance into Tibet and build the motherland, have displayed high revolutionary enthusiasm and overcome immense hardships, victoriously completing the construction tasks.

I. Leveling Erlang Mountain

In eastern Xikang, two folk songs circulate, describing the perilousness and difficulty of Erlang Mountain: "The top of Erlang Mountain divides the world; it's阴雨 (yin yu) on the east side and cold on the west side." "The first two or three months, the mountain is sealed by snow; the fourth, fifth, and sixth months, you get drenched; the seventh, eighth, and ninth months, it's good to walk; the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth months, you crawl like a dog."

However, despite the heavy rain in the mornings and evenings, or the fog-filled midday, and the fact that the sun is rarely seen more than five or six times a month, it could not stop the strong will of the People's Liberation Army. The engineers resolutely declared: "We won't come down the mountain until we level Erlang Mountain!" During the day, they braved the rain and fog, working tirelessly in the mud of the cliffs. At night, they rested in tents set up in the rain-soaked valleys, sleeping on the wood they had cut themselves. The air on the mountain was thin, and it was difficult to cook rice thoroughly; some people had nosebleeds but still refused to let go of the tools in their hands. In the cold wind and drizzle, the engineers were enthusiastic and worked more than twelve hours a day. Erlang Mountain was thus conquered by the People's Liberation Army.

II. Fighting Primitive Forests

In the project of repairing bridges and culverts, logging was also an arduous task. The engineers had to go to deep mountains more than twenty or even more than a hundred *li* away to cut wood. They felled one big tree after another, and then turned the big trees into timber to build bridges and repair culverts.

One day, a unit of the engineering corps accepted the task of felling the primitive forest on Zhugang Mountain. Zhugang Mountain faces Erlang Mountain, with its summit piercing the clouds, and the mountainous area is deserted. The old people at the foot of the mountain told the soldiers: "The mountain is high and there is no road. The Kuomintang went up once before, but came back empty-handed." But in front of the People's Liberation Army, there were no insurmountable difficulties. The engineers put forward the resounding slogan: "We will open the road, and we will find solutions to difficulties together."

The engineers cut through thorns and brambles, opened up roads, and climbed over ridges. Towering trees were entangled with dense vines, which even a strong wind could not blow through. Decaying animal and plant matter on the ground gave off a pungent odor. Leeches in the woods crawled on their legs and sucked blood. The air on the mountain was thin, making it difficult to breathe; moving around would make them sweat profusely, and resting would require them to put on cotton clothes. Good trees grew on cliffs where there was no place to stand. The engineers used leggings to tie their waists or hold themselves in the trees to chop down. Under such difficult conditions, the trees fell into the valley in rows, and the beasts were startled and fled in all directions. Communist Party member Song Peide gave his life in such a dangerous work. All comrades finally completed the logging task.

III. Conquering the Dadu River and the Grassland

The iron chain bridge over the Dadu River, a natural barrier crossed by the Red Army during the Long March, could not bear today's huge transportation. The river is 170 meters wide, and the surging rapids made not only bridging very difficult, but even wooden boats could not travel. But the engineers were determined to build a pontoon bridge so that transportation vehicles and advancing troops could pass quickly. A "Zhuge Liang Conference" was held by the first battalion of the engineering corps. After eleven days of experimentation, a load-bearing pontoon bridge was finally built.

Crossing the Dadu River and heading west along the Kang-Qing Highway, you have to pass through a grassland of about 100 kilometers wide. The geology of the grassland is soft silt, and cars traveling on it sink about a foot deep. In the rainy season, people and animals are in danger of falling into the mud. Building a solid and passable highway on this grassland is unimaginably difficult. However, this difficulty was overcome again in front of the People's Liberation Army. In addition to raising the roadbed, building more culverts, repairing drainage ditches, and enhancing the roadbed's load-bearing capacity, they drove plum blossom piles, filled with cobblestones, and paved with wood and track plates in many swampy areas, forming "dry bridges." The wisdom of the masses overcame the difficulties, and cars sped across the swampy grassland on the bridges.

IV. Marching West to Tibet Along the Road

The spirit of hard work and amazing wisdom of the engineering troops and engineering personnel led to a great number of creations and inventions, which smoothly completed the construction tasks, making the huge transport team and the magnificent advancing troops supporting the advance into Tibet move forward continuously on this highway!

On the perpetually snow-covered Zheduo Mountain and Erlang Mountain, in the rarely populated snow sea, the people's engineers erected houses and tents and established many snow-sweeping teams to clear the roads for the advancing troops. Rows of cars and columns of people passed by them and marched towards Tibet.

The desolate and silent Kangzang Plateau, which has been silent for many years, has begun to pulse. The Tibetan, Yi, and Han compatriots along the way happily watched their troops pass by on this road. These two highways have brought a new life to all ethnic groups. The People's Liberation Army has written a great historical poem on the Kangzang Plateau!

　　康藏高原上的开路先锋
    赵慎应　王世晋
    西康的东部，是属于向称“世界屋脊”的康藏高原的一部分。这里有横断山脉的主脉大雪山纵贯南北，拔海三千二百多公尺的二郎山和拔海四千七百多公尺的折多山耸峙东西。在这长年积雪的山峦间，有许多湍急的河流，和无数深深的峡谷。在大雪山的西面，还有一片广阔的水草地。川康、康青两条公路，就爬行在这雪山草地的高原上。
    从前，这两条公路，只是存在于地图上的红线，根本不能通车。而今，人民解放军西南军区工兵部队和工人弟兄们，在支援进军西藏和建设祖国的号召下，发挥了高度的革命热情，克服了无比的艰苦，胜利地完成着修筑任务。
    一、削平二郎山
    西康东部流传着两首民谣，形容二郎山的险恶和困难：“二郎山顶分世界，山东边阴雨山西边寒。”“正二三、雪封山，四五六、淋破头，七八九、正好走，十冬腊、学狗爬。”
    但是，尽管是大雨滂沱的早晚，或者是云雾弥漫的中午，一个月中很难见到五、六次太阳，却阻挡不了人民解放军的坚强意志，工兵们坚决地提出：“不把二郎山铲平不下山。”白天，他们冒着雨雾，在悬崖绝壁的泥泞中不停地工作着。晚上，他们就在雨多地湿的山谷中搭起的帐篷里休息，睡在自己砍来的木头上。山上空气稀薄，饭很难煮熟；有的人流出了鼻血，还不肯放松手中的工具。在冷风霪雨中，工兵们热情奋发，每天工作到十二小时以上。二郎山就这样被人民解放军征服了。
    二、向原始森林搏斗
    在抢修桥梁、涵洞的工程中，采伐木料也是一件艰巨的任务。工兵们要到二十多里甚至一百多里远的深山里去采伐木料。他们砍倒了一根一根的大树，再将大树变成木材，用来架成桥梁，修起涵洞。
    有一天，工兵们某部接受砍伐竹岗山上的原始森林的任务。竹岗山和二郎山迎面对峙，山顶插入云端，山区荒无人迹。山脚下的老百姓告诉战士们说：“山高无路，从前国民党上去看过一次，又空手下来了。”但在人民解放军面前，没有克服不了的困难。工兵们提出了响亮的口号：“路要由我们来开，有困难大家想办法。”
    工兵们披荆斩棘，开出了路，爬上了岭，参天的大树上纠缠着稠密的藤萝，连大风都吹不透。在地里腐朽的动物植物发出逼人的臭味。树林里的旱蚂蝗（水蛭）钻在腿上吸血。山上空气稀薄，呼吸都感到困难，动一动就满身大汗，休息下来又得穿棉衣。好树都长在悬崖绝壁上，连站脚的地方都没有。工兵们就用绑腿拴住腰或兜住身悬在树枝上动手砍伐。在这样艰苦的情况下，大树成排地被工兵们砍倒在山谷中，野兽被惊得四处奔逃。共产党员宋培德在这样艰险的工作中献出了他的生命。全体战友们终于完成了伐木任务。
    三、征服了大渡河和草原
    红军长征时抢渡过的天险大渡河上的铁索桥，不能载负今天这样庞大的运输。河宽一百七十公尺，澎湃的急流，不但架桥十分困难，连木船也不能行驶。但工兵们一定要架起一座浮桥，让运输的汽车和进军的队伍迅速通过。工兵某部一营召开了“诸葛亮会”，经过了十一天的试验，终于架成了可以载重的浮桥。
    渡过大渡河，沿康青公路西行还要经过约一百公里宽的一片草原。草原的地质是松软的泥沙，汽车走在上面要陷进一尺来深。到了雨季，人畜通过都有陷落在泥淖里的危险。要在这个水草地上修筑一条坚实可行的公路，困难是难以想像的。但是，这困难在人民解放军面前又被克服了。他们除提高路基、多筑涵洞，修好排水沟、增强路基抗载力外，在许多泥沼地带，打梅花桩，填鹅卵石，铺上木料和车道板，架成了“旱桥”。群众的智慧战胜了困难，汽车从桥上驰过泥沼的草原。
    四、沿着大路向西藏进军
    工兵部队和工程人员的艰苦奋斗的精神和惊人的智慧，出现了极多的创造、发明，顺利地完成了修筑任务，使得支援进军西藏的庞大运输队和雄壮的进军队伍，在这条公路上源源不断地前进！
    在长年积雪的折多山和二郎山上，在罕无人迹的雪海里，人民的工兵们架设起了房子和帐篷，成立了许多扫雪队，为着前进的队伍，清扫进军的道路。汽车的行列，人的队伍，就经过他们身旁向西藏进军。
    荒凉的死寂了多少年代的康藏高原，它的脉搏已开始跳动了。沿途的藏族、彝族和汉族同胞，喜悦地目送着自己的军队从这条路上走过。这两条公路，给各族人民带来了新生。人民解放军在康藏高原写下了伟大的历史诗篇！
