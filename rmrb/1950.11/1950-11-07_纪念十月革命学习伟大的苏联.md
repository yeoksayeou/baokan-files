　　Commemorating the October Revolution and Learning from the Great Soviet Union
　　Chairman of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, Ma Xulun
　　Today, as American imperialists are frantically carrying out aggression in Korea and extending the flames of war to our northeastern border, commemorating and celebrating the 33rd anniversary of the Soviet Revolution is both infinitely inspiring and of special significance. We think of how, after the success of this revolution, the Soviet people, under the leadership of Lenin and Stalin, established the world's first socialist state. We remember how the reactionary ruling classes of capitalist countries deeply hated and resented this fact, how they tried every possible means to obliterate this fact, and how they arrogantly and shamelessly united to immediately destroy this country. But the heroic Soviet people, united under the banner of Lenin and Stalin, finally repelled the armed intervention of fourteen countries. More than twenty years later, the Soviet people, under the leadership of Marshal Stalin, heroically repelled the Nazi invasion and led the people of the world to finally win the victory of the anti-fascist Second World War.

　　We think of how, for more than thirty years, the Soviet Union has been the central bulwark of world democracy and peace. Under the leadership of the Soviet Union, a powerful world democratic peace camp against imperialist aggression has been established. We will never forget the Soviet Union's help to the Chinese people and the Chinese revolution. The signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance on February 14, 1950, further laid the foundation for the permanent cooperation between the two peoples.

　　We remember the valuable experiences of the Soviet Revolution, we remember the great and just friendship of the Soviet people, and we will never betray the mission entrusted to us by history. The 475 million Chinese people, under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong and the Chinese Communist Party, have united and expressed their determination to defeat any provocation and aggression by American imperialists and their vassal states. Long live the Soviet October Revolution! Long live Marshal Stalin! Long live the world democratic peace camp against imperialist aggression!

　　纪念十月革命学习伟大的苏联
    中国民主促进会主席马叙伦
    当美帝国主义者疯狂地在朝鲜进行侵略，并把战火烧到我们东北边境的今日，我们来纪念和祝贺苏联革命三十三周年，是有无限感奋而且是有特别意义的。我们想到苏联人民在列宁和斯大林领导之下，在这次革命成功之后建立了世界上第一个社会主义国家，当时资本主义国家的反动统治阶级是怎样深恶痛绝地面对这一事实，怎样千方百计地企图抹煞这一事实，怎样狂妄无耻地联合起来要把这个国家立刻加以消灭。但是英勇的苏联人民团结在列宁和斯大林的旗帜之下，终于把十四个国家的武装干涉打退了。二十多年之后，苏联人民在斯大林大元帅领导之下，又英勇地击退了纳粹的侵攻，并领导世界人民最后赢得反法西斯的第二次世界大战的胜利。
    我们想到了三十多年以来，苏联一直是世界民主和平的中坚堡垒。在苏联的领导之下，一个强大的反对帝国主义侵略的世界民主和平阵营建立起来了，苏联对于中国人民和中国革命的帮助，我们是更加不会忘记的。一九五○年二月十四日中苏友好同盟互助条约的订立，进一步奠定两国人民永久合作的基础。
    我们想起了苏联革命的这些宝贵经验，我们记住了苏联人民的伟大正义友情，我们决不辜负历史所付予我们的使命。四万七千五百万中国人民，在毛泽东主席和中国共产党的领导之下已经团结一致和表示了他们的决心，一定能够打败美帝国主义者及其附庸国家的任何挑衅与侵略。苏联十月革命万岁！斯大林大元帅万岁！反对帝国主义侵略的世界民主和平阵营万岁！
