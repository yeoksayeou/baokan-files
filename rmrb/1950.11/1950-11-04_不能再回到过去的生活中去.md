　　Can No Longer Return to the Past

　　·Yang Qi·

　　Recalling the past and comparing it with the present easily makes people understand why the workers so hate the American bandits. Whenever the workers talk about the American imperialists' banditry of expanding the war of aggression, they will naturally think of the life of five years ago. Because they know that the imperialists have always hated any happy life of the people; now the US imperialists are expanding the war of aggression precisely to drag them back to that miserable life.

　　Zhang Yuzhen, an advanced producer in the roving thread workshop of the Dalian Fishing Net Company's Second Factory, created the highest roving thread record of the entire fishing net company in this anti-US aggression production competition. The daily quota for roving thread in the factory is nineteen kilograms (twenty strands). In the past, her highest was twenty-seven kilograms, but in this competition, although the working hours were only extended by two hours, she actually roved 54.8 kilograms. The whole factory was shaken. When the reporter asked her why she was able to achieve such results and what gave her such strength, she talked about the comparison between her past life and her present life. Zhang Yuzhen is not old, about seventeen or eighteen years old, but from her underdeveloped body, one can still see the suffering that her past painful life gave her. After suffering the oppression of the Japanese imperialists, the life of her family was still not good in the first two or three years after "August 15" because the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang blockaded Lushun and Dalian. She is unwilling to recall the past life and is very willing to talk about the future. She has been inspired by the happy life of the Soviet people seen in the movies. But the US imperialists launched a war of aggression, which could not help but remind her of the shuddering life of the past. The US imperialists and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang gave her too much pain. She said: "At that time, my family couldn't make ends meet for two out of three meals. Due to the blockade by the US imperialists and the Kuomintang reactionaries, factories in Lushun and Dalian closed down and workers lost their jobs. My father had no work to do, and everything was sold out, so he had to go out to beg for food. The little things he begged for, the brothers fought over them. My mother cried all day long." Now life is getting better day by day. Four out of seven people in the family have joined the workforce. The things that the family had sold out in the past have now been gradually bought back. A few years of experience have made her deeply believe that if she can build in peace for a few more years, life will definitely get better.

　　She knows that the recent aggression of the US imperialists is precisely to drag her back to the past life. What to do? To this question, she raised her voice and said without hesitation: "Together with the people of the whole country, I will also fight it!"

　　The workers of the First Machine Shop of the Guanghe Factory recently held a forum, and the workers launched a discussion around the center of "The US imperialists want to destroy our happy life and also make us live a painful life, what should we do?" The workers all spoke. Zhu Bingren said: "I am doing fifty tubes now. I take these fifty tubes as fifty American devils. Finishing one is equal to eliminating one American devil. I will work harder and finish them earlier." He proposed to guarantee to increase the output of tubes from four to six per day in the past. Zhu Songchun said: "I didn't want to do this work anymore. In order to oppose US imperialist aggression, I am determined to do it to the end!" He also guaranteed to increase the output of bed cabinets he was working on. These guarantees are credible. In the past few competitions, they have all made guarantees, and those guarantees have been fulfilled as scheduled every time. The young worker Tian Jingli is a bit weak. When the factory transferred him from the finished product warehouse to work as a lathe worker, he was dissatisfied and asked to do some light work. When he realized that the intensified aggression of the US imperialists has seriously threatened the security of the motherland and his own happy life, he began to feel that he was wrong. He said: "I am wrong to do this, it can only make the US imperialists happy. I have decided to accept the task assigned to me by the superiors, and I will work hard!" He is a fifth-grade worker and is currently welding couplings. At first, he could only turn three or four a day, but now he has increased it to five or six.

　　In order to defend the security of the motherland and to defend their own happy life, the workers are more united in the face of this solemn task; those who were originally active are more active, and those who are behind are catching up.

### 不能再回到过去的生活中去

　　不能再回到过去的生活中去
    ·杨启·
    回忆过去，对比现在，很容易使人明白为什么工人们那样地仇恨着美国强盗。每当工人们谈起美帝扩大侵略战争的强盗行为时，都会自然而然地联想到五年前的生活。因为他们知道，帝国主义者从来是仇视人民的任何幸福生活的；现在美帝扩大侵略战争，正是要将他们拖回那种悲惨的生活里去。
    大连渔网公司第二工厂捣线场先进生产者张玉珍，在此次反美侵略生产竞赛中，创造了全渔网公司捣线的最高纪录。该厂捣线定额每日是十九公斤（二十股），过去她最高曾达到二十七公斤，在此次竞赛中，工作时间虽然只延长了两小时，但她竟捣至五十四点八公斤。全厂为之震动。当记者问她为什么能创造这样的成绩，是什么给了她这样的力量时，她就谈到了过去的生活和现在生活的对比。张玉珍年纪不大，十七、八岁的样子，但从她那不大发育的身体上，仍可以看出过去痛苦生活给她的磨难。受尽了日本帝国主义者的压榨，“八一五”后的最初二三年，她一家的生活仍然不好，因为蒋介石匪帮封锁了旅大。她不愿回想过去的生活，很愿意谈谈将来，她已为从电影上看到的苏联人民的幸福生活所感召。但美帝发动了侵略战争，却不能不使她回想起过去那种不寒而栗的生活。美帝及蒋介石匪帮给她的痛苦太深了。她说：“那时，我家三顿饭有两顿揭不开锅。由于美帝和国民党反动派的封锁，旅大工厂关门，工人失业。父亲没有活干，东西都卖光了，只好出去讨饭。讨回来的一点东西，兄弟们为了争吃打了起来。母亲愁得整天哭。”现在生活是一天比一天好起来了，家中七口人，有四个人参加了工作，过去家中卖得净光的东西，现在又一点一点地置了回来。几年的经验使她深深相信，如果能和和平平地再建设几年，生活定会更好起来。
    她知道，最近美帝的侵略行动，正是要将她拖回过去的生活中去。怎么办呢？对这个问题，她提高了声音，毫不犹疑地说：“和全国人民一块，我也要打它！”
    广和工厂第一机械场工人日前召开了一个座谈会，工人们围绕着“美帝要破坏我们的幸福生活，还要使我们过痛苦的生活，我们应当怎么办？”这样一个中心，展开了讨论。工人们都发了言。朱秉仁说：“我现在正干五十个筒子。我拿这五十个筒子当成五十个美国鬼子，干完一个就等于消灭一个美国鬼子。我要加劲干，早些干完。”他提出保证，要将筒子产量由过去一天四个提高到六个。朱嵩春说：“我本来不想做这个工作了，为了反对美帝侵略，我坚决干到底！”他并保证将他干的床头箱子产量提高。这些保证都是可以置信的。过去的几次竞赛，他们都提出了保证，那些保证每次都如约实现。青年工人田景礼身体有些弱，当工厂将他从成品仓库调去做车床工时，他不满意，要求做一些轻快的工作。当他认清了美帝的加紧侵略已严重地威胁到祖国的安全和自己的幸福生活时，开始觉得自己是错了。他说：“我这样是不对的，只能让美帝看了喜欢。我决定接受上级给我分配的任务，而且我要努力干！”他是个五级工人，现在正干连焊接合，最初他一天只能车三、四个，现在已提高到五、六个。
    为了保卫祖国的安全，为了保卫自己的幸福生活，工人们在这个庄严的任务面前，团结得更加紧了；原来积极的更加积极了，落后的也赶了上来。
