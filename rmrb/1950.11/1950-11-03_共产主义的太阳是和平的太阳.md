The Sun of Communism is the Sun of Peace
Soviet Union, Pavlenko

The French Communist writer Henri Barbusse once wrote: "When liberated humanity points to the day of its liberation, it will celebrate October 25, 1917 (note) with the greatest enthusiasm..."

On this day, the Soviet state was born. Her first declaration to mankind was a call for peace. Peace - this glorious word has become the motto of the new power; it has become her most important precept.

Give peace to working humanity, give punishment to the few despicable ones, the exploiters, terrorists, and those who enslave the powerless majority - this is the cry of the Soviet people. Since then, the propaganda of peace, the defense of peace, and the unwavering struggle for world peace have become the foundation of socialist society and the foundation of its leading and inspiring force - the great Communist Party.

Thirty-three years have passed, and throughout this period, the Soviet Union has unwaveringly implemented a wise and peace-loving policy. We shout: Give peace to all nations! Give peace to every country! Give peace to humanity!

During this period, our country has been repeatedly subjected to military attacks, but has not attacked any country. Not a single Soviet soldier has landed on the coasts of Britain, France, or America, but British, French, and American robbers have invaded Soviet territory, threatening her freedom and independence. The call to defend the independence of small countries and the sovereignty of weak nations has always been sent from Moscow, not from Washington, London, or Paris. Everyone knows whose troops plundered the Philippines and Abyssinia, shot children in Malaya, and shot women in Indonesia or Siam.

Whose politicians are these—Senator Russell of Georgia, Senator Johnston of South Carolina, Senator Long Law of Louisiana, and Senator Stennis of Mississippi—these shameless propagandists who clamor to carry out killings on foreign lands far from their own country? These are (I do not wish to insult the American people) Truman's activists.

What is the reactionary upper house member Mitchell, who not long ago declared that "only the hydrogen bomb can guarantee world peace"? He is also Truman's godson, but of British origin.

Who is Woodrow Wyatt, who not long ago, presuming to be a left-wing Labor Party member, brazenly declared that banning the atomic bomb was a stupid thing, serving? He is also a servant of Truman.

These cannibals, these haters of mankind, reactionaries of all stripes and colors, and American reactionaries worse than these, desperately clamor that the Soviet Union is like an aggressor.

But the lies of the imperialist war-mongers and their hired propagandists have been exposed before the whole world. The Soviet Union enjoys a high degree of prestige among the masses of people in all countries of the world.

The Soviet Union—is the motherland of the most courageous great idea of human happiness, which cultivates the best wisdom and noble hearts. The Soviet Union—is the ruler of the minds of all progressive humanity and the simple people of the world. This has aroused the love of all advanced people in the world for us and hatred from the reactionary side. The Soviet Union has never aggressed against anyone, on the contrary, she has always ruthlessly defeated all those who attacked her in any circumstances. This displeased the reactionaries and aggressors. This also frightened some people.

Eliminate these aggressors? It is said that this is uncivilized, this is barbaric! Is that really so? How can we not eliminate them! The Japanese hadn't even had time to spy on the Soviet border when they encountered such a painful beating near Lake Khanka as a mainland robber would receive! In the Khingan Mountains, do you know what happened? Nothing special either. The Japanese aggressors suffered what kind of painful beating - some guys across the ocean are probably equally unhappy, right. Hitler and Mussolini were also instigated to attack, but the stubborn Bolsheviks have always had the terrible habit of kicking out intruders. Thanks to the victory of the Soviet Union, this or that attacker, as the Ukrainian proverb says: "Things did not go as desired!" They were all wiped out.

The Soviet people not only drove the robbers out of their own country, but also liberated the neighboring lands from the brown plague and saved mankind from the fascist robbers.

The sun of true democracy has risen in the skies of Poland, formerly ruled by landlords, and Romania, ruled by nobles, the Hungarian dukes wearing theatrical costumes have dispersed, some princes who fled quickly have disappeared in the garbage heaps of Switzerland, and thus, a broad road to socialism, progress, and national prosperity has been opened up in front of the suffering people.

China, which has won victory after a tenacious and long-term struggle and has obtained the right to arrange its own destiny freely, has embarked on the road of peace and the victory of labor.

Comrade Stalin said: "... The people are no longer willing to live as before, they have taken the fate of their countries into their own hands, established a democratic order, and are carrying out an active struggle against reactionary forces and against new warmongers."

The German people, liberated from Hitler's fascist tyranny, have turned to a people's democratic system in their eastern lands and established the independent and peace-loving German Democratic Republic.

The people of Thailand are fighting for their future, Malaya is fighting, and the people of Indonesia and Vietnam are fighting, and the heroic Korean people are staunchly resisting the American interventionists. American imperialists and their accomplices are trying to strangle the freedom and independence of the people of these countries. But… Comrade Stalin taught us that: "Only some old people can think that the law of cannons is more powerful than the law of history, and that the wheel of history can be reversed with bullets..."

Imperialism—is violence and plunder, aggression and cultural bankruptcy, enslaving nations and depriving them of their national independence.

The essence of communism—is the victory of peace, the appeal of construction. How many new factories, new villages, and cities have the Soviet people built!

We have dreamed for centuries of changing the Kara-Kum Desert and the hungry grasslands, but this long-cherished wish has only been realized by the people of the Stalin era.

Crimea, which was formerly considered the pearl of the country, is changing, becoming better, richer, and more beautiful.

The fantasies of Russian travelers about Arctic voyages have only become a reality under the Bolsheviks and socialism.

The brilliant scholars Michurin, Tsiolkovsky, and other amazing inventions would have stagnated in their own imaginations if they had not been supported by the Soviet power that supports everything new, advanced, and progressive.

Our whole life is full of construction.

Roads have been opened up under impassable mountains, and many rivers have changed their courses, flowing to places that have never been reached before. Our scholars are making one more brilliant invention after another. Our doctors are curing diseases that cannot be cured in capitalist countries. Our agricultural scientists have obtained bumper harvests in places where scholars like Morgan across the ocean cannot even cultivate burdocks.

Why does everything that the precious hands of its people touch succeed for a socialist country? Why are we capable of everything? Because the Soviet system makes people stronger and more powerful. Our country is moving forward at a speed that capitalist countries cannot match.

Fifty-five years ago, the great French humanist Romain Rolland wrote in his diary:

"In a hundred years, Europe will become socialist or perish."

The vast majority of Europe has become or is becoming socialist before the period predicted by Romain Rolland. Socialism is increasingly entering the consciousness of the European people.

No matter how long the winter night is, no matter how thick the dark clouds are, the sun will surely rise, and no matter what, dawn will always come, the morning glow is shining, and the sun of peace and the victory of labor—the sun of communism—will shine through the dark clouds and snowstorms and illuminate the world. It will certainly be so. People want to live in peace, want to build, hope for a happy life, and do not want to destroy.

That is why the dates of our huge constructions are so accurate, that is why various long-cherished wishes that could not be realized for centuries have become daily plans in our generation. We are moving forward, seeing farther than others, knowing more than others, and at the same time firmly believing in our potential capabilities. We embody the best strength of mankind, we express the will and wishes of all people of good will. That is why peace-loving people in all countries of the world are watching us with firm hope.

We are fighting for the future of mankind with peaceful creative labor. We are consolidating peace among all nations. We are the creators of happiness for all peoples.

### 共产主义的太阳是和平的太阳

专栏：

    共产主义的太阳是和平的太阳
    苏联巴甫连柯
    法国共产党员作家安里·巴比塞曾写道：“当被解放了的人类要指出自己解放的日子时，它将以最大的热情来庆祝一九一七年十月二十五日（注）……”
    在这一天，苏维埃国家诞生了。她对人类的第一个宣言就是对和平的呼吁。和平——这个光辉的字眼已成为新强国的题词；已成为她的最重要的宝训。
    把和平给劳动的人类，把惩罚给少数的卑鄙者、剥削者、恐怖分子和奴役着无权的大多数人的一些家伙——这就是苏联人民的呐喊。从那时起，对和平的宣传，保卫和平和争取全世界和平的始终不渝的斗争，已成为社会主义社会的根基及其领导的和鼓舞的力量——伟大的共产党——的基础。
    三十三年过去了，在这段全部时间内，苏联始终不渝地执行着英明的，爱好和平的政策。我们高呼：把和平给各民族！把和平给每个国家！把和平给人类！
    在这段时间内，我国曾屡次遭受军事攻击，但却没有进攻过任何国家。没有一个苏联军队的战士曾在英国海岸、法国海岸和美国海岸登过陆，可是英国、法国和美国的强盗们却侵入过苏联的国土，威吓着她的自由和独立。保卫小国的独立和保卫弱小民族的主权的呼声，永远从莫斯科发出去，而不是从华盛顿、伦敦或巴黎。谁都明白什么国家的军队掠夺了菲律宾和阿比西尼亚，在马来亚枪杀儿童，在印度尼西亚或暹罗枪杀妇女。
    这是谁的政客呢—乔治亚州参议员鲁塞尔、南卡罗来纳州参议员约翰斯顿、路易斯安那州参议员朗洛和密士西必州参议员斯秦尼斯—这些扬言远离本国而在外国土地上进行屠杀的无耻的宣传者们是谁的呢？这是（我不愿侮辱美国人民）杜鲁门的活动家。
    不久以前曾宣称“只有氢气弹才能保证全世界和平”的反动分子上院议员密契尔是什么人呢？这也是杜鲁门的干儿子，不过出身于英国而已。
    不久以前，自认为左派工党党员的乌德罗·维特，曾大言不惭地宣称禁止原子弹是一件愚蠢的事情，他是为谁服务的呢？这也是杜鲁门的奴仆。
    这些食人者、这些憎恨人类的人，各种皮毛各种颜色的反动分子和比这些更坏的美国反动分子，都拼命地叫嚣着：苏联好像是侵略者。
    但是帝国主义的战争贩子和他们的雇佣宣传家们的谎言，在全世界前面却被揭穿了。苏联在全世界所有国家的人民群众之间享有着高度的威望。
    苏联——是最勇敢的伟大的人类幸福的思想的祖国，这个思想培养着最好的智慧和高贵的心灵。苏联——是一切进步人类和全世界纯朴人们的思想的统治者。这件事引起了全世界一切先进者对我们的热爱和来自反动方面的憎恨。苏联任何时候都没有侵略过谁，反之，她在任何情况下总是无情地击溃了一切向她进攻的人。这件事使反动派和侵略者不高兴了。这件事也使某些人骇怕起来。
    消灭这些侵略者？据说这是不文明，这是野蛮的！难道真是这样吗？怎么可以不消灭呢！日本人还没有来得及窥伺苏联边疆，在兴凯湖附近就遭遇了大陆强盗所受到那样的痛击！在兴安岭，你知道曾发生了什么事么？也没什么特别的。日本侵略者挨受到什么样的痛击，——海洋彼岸的一些家伙大约是同样不高兴的罢。希特勒和墨索里尼也是受了嗾使来进攻的，但倔强的布尔塞维克一向就有把闯进来的暴客轰出门外的可怕的习惯。由于苏联的胜利，这个或那个进攻者正如乌克兰谚语所说：“事不逞愿！”都被消灭了。
    苏联人民不仅把强盗们从自己的国土上赶出去，而且也从褐色的瘟疫中解放了邻近的土地，从法西斯强盗手中拯救了人类。
    真正民主的太阳，升上了以前地主统治的波兰和贵族统治的罗马尼亚的天空，穿着戏剧性的外衣的匈牙利公爵们都四散了，逃跑得快的有些王子们在瑞士的垃圾堆中消隐了，于是在遭受了痛苦的人民前面，打开了一条走向社会主义、进步、全民繁荣的宽广的大路。
    经历过顽强的长期斗争而获得了胜利，取得了自由安排自己命运的权利的中国，已走上了和平与劳动胜利的道路。
    斯大林同志说：“……人民不愿再按照老样子生活下去，他们把自己国家的命运掌握在自己的手中，建立起民主的秩序，进行着反对反动势力的及反对新战争贩子的积极斗争。”
    从希特勒的法西斯暴政中解放了的德国人民，在自己东部土地上转入了人民民主制度，建立了独立的和爱好和平的德意志民主共和国。
    泰国人民为自己的未来而斗争着，马来亚在战斗着，印度尼西亚和越南人民在战斗着，英勇的朝鲜人民坚强地抗击着美国干涉者。美国帝国主义者及其帮凶们正在企图绞杀这些国家人民的自由与独立。但是……斯大林同志教导我们说：“只有一些衰老的人们能够想到，大炮的法则比历史的法则更有力量，用枪弹可以倒转历史的轮子。……”
    帝国主义——就是暴力和掠夺，侵略和文化破产，奴役各民族和剥夺他们的民族独立。
    共产主义的本质——就是和平的胜利，建设的感召力。苏联人民已经建设了多少的新工厂、新村庄和城市啊！
    我们数世纪来梦想着改变卡拉——库姆沙漠和饥饿的草原，可是这个宿愿在斯大林时代的人们的手下才得到实现。
    从前就认为是国家的珍珠的克里米亚在改变着，已变得更好、更富庶和更美丽了。
    俄国旅行家关于北极的航行的幻想，只有在布尔塞维克和社会主义之下，才成为了事实。
    天才的学者米邱林、齐奥科夫斯基及其他的惊人发明，假如没有支持一切新的、先进的、进步的苏维埃政权来支持的话，也会停滞于自己的想像之中。
    我们的全部生活是充满着建设的。
    在难以通行的山下开辟了道路，许多的河流改变了河道，向任何时候都未曾经过的地方流去。我们的学者们作出一个比一个更光辉的发明。我们的医生们医治着在资本主义国家中不能医治的疾病。我们的农业学者在海洋彼岸的摩尔干学者连牛蒡也不能培植的地方，获得了丰收。
    为什么对于一个社会主义国家来说，它的人民的珍贵的手所触及的一切都会成功的呢？为什么我们对于一切都能胜任呢？因为苏维埃制度使人们更有力量，更坚强。我们的国家正以资本主义国家望尘莫及的速度向前迈进。
    五十五年以前，伟大的法国人道主义者罗曼·罗兰在自己的日记中曾写道：
    “在一百年之间，欧洲将成为社会主义的或者归于消灭。”
    欧洲的绝大部分在罗曼·罗兰所预言的时期以前已成为或正成为社会主义的。社会主义愈来愈多地进入欧洲人民的意识之中。
    尽管冬夜是怎样的漫长，尽管乌云是怎样的浓厚，但是太阳必定要升起来，无论怎样，黎明总就要来到，朝霞在闪烁着，和平的和劳动胜利的太阳——共产主义的太阳将穿过乌云和风雪而普照世界。一定会如此。人们都愿意在和平中生活，愿意建设，希望幸福的生活而不愿意破坏。
    这就是为什么我们的巨大建筑的日期这样的准确，这就是为什么几世纪来都不能实现的各种宿愿，在我们这一代成为日常的计划。我们向前迈进着，看得比别人远，知道得比别人更多，同时深信自己的潜在能力。我们体现着人类最好的力量，我们表现出一切具有良善意志的人们的意志与愿望。这就是为什么世界各国爱好和平的人们以坚定的希望注视着我们。
    我们以和平创造性的劳动为人类的未来而战斗。我们巩固着各民族之间的和平。我们是各族人民的幸福的创造者。
