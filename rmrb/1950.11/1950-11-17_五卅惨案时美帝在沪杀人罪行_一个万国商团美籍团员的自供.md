　　U.S. Imperialist Crimes of Murder in Shanghai During the May 30th Massacre: A Confession from an American Member of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps

　　“Did Americans participate in the massacre of the Chinese people during the Shanghai May 30th Massacre in 1925?” Yes, they did indeed participate in the massacre. The following is a letter written by an American member of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps to a friend named Hiank in Chicago, two weeks after participating in the slaughter of the Shanghai people. This letter exposes the heinous and evil actions of the Anglo-American imperialists in Shanghai at the time. This is truly an account of blood debts; a confession from a murderer; clear and irrefutable evidence of U.S. imperialist aggression against China and the persecution of the Chinese people.

　　This American member of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, named Lorry Smith, was an American "entrepreneur" living in Shanghai, an engineer by training. During the May 30th Incident, he served with the Public Concession's Old Zha Gate Police Station as a temporary volunteer officer, and personally directed the massacre of the Chinese people.

　　This letter was written at the Shanghai American Club and later published in an American magazine. It contains rumors and fallacies slandering the Chinese people, as well as various atrocities he himself admitted to. The following is an excerpt of his participation in the massacre of the Shanghai people, which we, the Chinese people, must firmly remember as hatred!

　　“...Every morning we assign patrol officers to various locations, and in the mornings we drink and fight in the Astor House Hotel. In the afternoons and evenings, we shoot the mad Chinese people.

　　“On the afternoon of the riot, I was ordered to move out. I arrived at the designated Old Zha Gate Police Station just after the shooting had started. As I was squeezing through the riotous crowd, I was hit by stones and was still a few steps away from the front gate of the police station when a volley of shots rang out. Instantly, eight people were hit by bullets, four died outside the police station, and many others, dead and wounded, lay askew in the middle of the street... Blood splattered eight feet high on the door, and the road gradually became slippery because of the excessive bleeding. The people in the front row were simply shattered because we were using Colt .45 caliber rapid-fire guns...

　　“Afterward, we went to the scene of the incident to distribute weapons to the American Volunteer Corps; we had a lot of ammunition, extremely heavy lead-filled clubs, and Effie-Field guns (which use shrapnel); at night, because we had to inform the foreign residential area of the news (the Nanjing Road riot), we had to drive out the rioters on East Laughton Road. ... We confronted tens of thousands of ignorant Chinese people for three hours. There were eighteen or nineteen of us in total, all carrying baseball bats, like the Irish ones, very thick and difficult to break. I have already broken two; we broke the necks of many Chinese people, smashed twelve or thirteen Chinese heads, crushed the spine of one Chinese, and smashed many faces, noses, hands, and feet. The next day (June 1), after dinner, we were fully armed again and persistently confronted them, killing more than a dozen Chinese people, many of whom were permanently disabled, and a lot of blood flowed on Nanjing Road.

　　“We also started up armored cars, with steel armor more than an inch thick, with gun mounts and machine guns, built like tanks. These two armored cars drove at full speed straight into the crowd. The carnage that occurred after these cars passed by was truly terrible. Two people were crushed to death, their internal organs were squeezed all over the street, their limbs and bones were broken, and most of those who fled also had their limbs crushed. But the road was clear, and foreign cars could travel unimpeded...

　　“From night until dawn, we transmitted slogans in groups of four and five. Sometimes the Chinese hid in corners and shot at us, sometimes not. Piles of bricks that were prepared for building houses fell on our heads... We dared not enter the Chinese area.

　　“On the morning of June 2nd, the streets were full of Chinese people... They all had weapons, but no firearms. At first, we used fire hoses to shoot water at them, but it was of no use at all... Even though they were soaked, these bastards still chopped at us with bricks. I was hit on the head by one of them, and the back of my uniform was slashed with a chain knife. I immediately ended the life of this bastard. When the fire brigade was beaten back by bricks and had to retreat, the machine gun squad opened fire on them for the first time, killing several people, and the sound of moaning and screaming immediately filled the air, and the blood of the dead and wounded immediately stained the street red.

　　“At one end of the street, many Chinese hooligans stopped the trams and poured kerosene on them... Naturally, we gave them the most cruel reward, silencing them instantly.

　　“I and a small squad of elite British Marines went together to post martial law notices. When we posted them in the most unstable area, we were dispersed by the Chinese... Indian soldiers stabbed the crowd with bayonets. I only pulled the guide forward. Five Chinese people were seriously wounded by us, and one had his head smashed open. ... We hid in a hotel... In order to defend ourselves, we had to shoot at them. No one was killed in this shooting, only a few were injured. We heard gunshots and machine gun fire... In the most famous place in the Far East—where there are the largest jewelry stores, gold shops, and a huge oriental building—a battle took place. At one end of this street was a squad of Scottish soldiers, two squads of American cavalry, and three armored cars slowly driving down the street. Inside the steel plates of these cars, machine guns were firing at the crowd, and the places they passed through became bloody paths.

　　“From the windows of the New World Amusement Park, Chinese people were propping up guns and shooting out; at the same time, in my newly built house, our people were also setting up several machine guns. The Indian soldiers I led ran to the small houses where some Chinese people were shooting out, and the gunfire there immediately ceased. I also ran to another house where Chinese people were shooting, and we beat all those who were shooting to death there and occupied the place.

　　“We fired our guns at the concentrated lights for two hours until dusk. We stormed into the Ningbo Guildhall and captured many people on the second floor. Ten thousand bullets were fired, and their lives were ended early. This has great significance, and those who were shooting were all Reds...

　　“I want to say: American sailors are the treasures of Shanghai. They surrounded the outskirts of Shanghai and have a good experience in military tactics. They suppressed the riot in Shanghai without any effort. American sailors have often come to Shanghai before, but never like this time to show off - they never dreamed that the bankers here would personally talk to them...

　　“We attacked the Tongde Medical College, and the next day, we sent sailors to replace our team. The sailors occupied the Tongde school building, treating it as a wartime base—because this school building was just on a road at the junction of the Chinese area and the concession, near the McGon Road Bridge. As soon as the sailors arrived, they immediately started work, removing the plaster two feet high from the wall and setting up machine guns and military radio stations. They sent four people to the bridge. ... After three seconds, the boundary line of the Chinese area had retreated two hundred yards...

　　“Later, I participated in another ‘drunken tour of the Chinese area’: the Marine Corps Captain, the North-China Daily News reporter, and I. We arrived in the Chinese area, where Chinese officers had orders that soldiers could shoot any armed foreigners entering the area. I was wearing plain clothes that day, but I was carrying a gun. Before we had gone far, we were already very drunk: we broke into the 'house of Soviet Russian spies'; only I had a weapon among us, and I picked up the gun and fired it at the ceiling. In this way, we can say that we immediately conquered the residents of this area, and we ‘created hell’ here until dawn.”

　　五卅惨案时美帝在沪杀人罪行
    一个万国商团美籍团员的自供
    “一九二五年上海五卅惨案中，美国人参加屠杀中国人民？”是的，的确参加屠杀过。下面便是一个上海万国商团的美籍团员，在参加了屠杀上海人民之后两星期，写给他一位在芝加哥的朋友名叫罕克（Hiank）的一封信。这封信暴露了当时英美帝国主义者在沪的种种穷凶极恶的情状。这真是一篇血账；是一份凶手的供状；是美帝国主义者侵略中国、残害中国人民的一个明白的铁证。
    这个万国商团美籍团员名叫洛梨·史密斯（Lorry Smith），是住在上海的一个美国“企业家”，工程师出身，五卅时，替公共租界老闸捕房服务，当临时义务巡官，曾亲自指挥屠杀中国人民。
    这信是在上海美国俱乐部写的，后来在美国某杂志上刊露出来，内有诬蔑中国人的谣言谬论，也有自己承认的种种暴行。兹将其参加屠杀上海人民的经过，摘录如下，作为中国人民、我们必须牢牢记住的仇恨！
    “……我们在这里天天早晨分派巡捕到各处去站岗，上半天就在礼查饭店里喝酒打架，到了下午同晚上呢，去枪杀那些发狂的中国人。
    “就在暴动的那一天下午，我奉令出动。我在刚开过枪的时候到达指定服务的老闸捕房门前。当我正挤过暴动的群众，身上挨了石块，距捕房大门口还差几步路时，排枪声起，登时便有八个人吃着枪子，四个人死在捕房门外，还有许多死的伤的，都歪斜的躺在街心……门上溅的血有八英尺高，路上因为流血过多，渐渐地泞滑起来。死在前一排的人简直被打成碎块，因为我们用的是柯利特四十五号式的快枪……
    “事后，我们又到出事的地点，将武器分散给美国商团；我们有很多的枪弹，极重的灌铅棍子，哀斐利达式的枪械（是用榴霰弹的枪）；夜里，我们因为要把这消息（南京路的暴动）通知外人居住区域，所以我们必须要驱逐东劳合路的暴徒。……我们同上万的无知识的中国人对峙了三个钟头。我们一共有十八九个人，都拿着打棒球用的棍子，同爱尔兰式的一样，很粗很不容易断的。我已经打坏了两根；我们打断了许多中国人的颈骨，打破了十二三个中国脑袋，捶碎了一个中国人的背脊，打烂了许多面孔鼻子手脚。第二天（按系六月一日）饭后，我们又全副武装，持久地同他们对敌，打死了十多个中国人，有许多成了终身的残废，南京路上流了许多鲜血。
    “我们又开起铁甲汽车，钢甲有一英寸多厚，上面有炮架子，有机关枪，装制得好像坦克车一般模样。这两辆铁甲汽车开足了马力直往人堆里冲去。这种车子开过去之后，发生的惨状真是厉害得很。压死了两个人，这两个人的内脏挤得满街都是，他们的手脚筋骨都压断了，逃避的人也大半压碎了手足。可是马路上却清静了，外国人的汽车都能畅行无阻……
    “一夜到天亮，我们四个人一行，五个人一队地传口号，有些时候中国人躲在屋角朝我们打枪，有些时候不怎样，那些预备盖房子的砖头堆，推倒在我们头上……我们不敢走进华界去。
    “六月二日的清晨，街上的中国人都聚满了……他们都带着家伙，但是没有枪械。起初，我们用救火水龙向他们射水，可是一点效验都没有……把他们浑身都浇透了，这些混蛋还照旧拿砖头砍我们。我的脑袋上吃着他们一下子，制服的背面被他们用链刀划破。我随手就把这个混蛋的性命结果。在救火队被他们用砖头打得落花流水，不得不退的时候，机关枪队第一次朝他们开枪，打死了几个人，辗转呼号的声音立刻充满在空中，死者伤者的鲜血马上就染红了街面。
    “有一头街梢上，有许多的中国流氓把电车拦住，用煤油浇在上面……自然我们送给他们了最残酷的酬谢，一下子就叫他们寂然无声。
    “我和一小队精悍的英国陆战队中的水兵，一齐去贴戒严布告。贴到最不安的区域，我们便被中国人挤散……印度兵用枪刺向群众乱扎。我只拉住向导的人前行。有五个中国人被我们扎伤很重，一个人被我们打开了脑袋。……我们躲到一家旅馆里去……为着防卫起见，不得不朝他们开枪。这次的开枪一个也没有打死，只是打伤了几个。我们听见枪声和机关枪响……在远东最著名的地方——那里有最大的珠宝店、金铺，还有一座极大的东方建筑物——发生了战斗。这街的一端有一队苏格兰兵，两队美国的马队，有三辆铁甲汽车慢慢地在街上走过去。在这汽车的钢板里面，有机关枪朝着人群射击，他所经过的地方，全成为血路。
    “在新世界游戏场的窗户里，有中国人支着枪往外放；同时，在我的一所新造的房子里，我们的人也架着几架机关枪。我带的印度兵跑到有几个中国人朝外开枪的小屋子里去，那里的枪声马上就没有了。我也跑到别一所有中国人开枪的屋子里去，我们把那些开枪的全活活地打死在那里，就把这个地方占据了。
    “我们往火光集中的地点，开了两个钟头的枪，直到黄昏时候。我们冲进宁波同乡会，在二层楼上把许多人捉住了。万弹齐发，把他们的性命早结果了。这个有重大的意义在里头，他们那些放枪的全是赤党……
    “我要说：美国水兵是上海的宝贝，他们包围上海四郊，军事战术的经验很好，不费丝毫气力便镇压了暴动的上海。美国水兵以前也常常到上海来，然而从没有像这一次的出风头——他们做梦也想不到，这里的银行家都亲自和他们接谈……
    “我们攻入了同德医科大学，第二天，便派了水兵来，代替我们的队伍。水兵占领同德校舍，把他当作战时的地盘——因为这一校舍刚刚在华界和租界交界的一条马路上，在麦根路桥边。水兵一到之后，立刻开始工作，把两英尺高的墙上石灰都去掉，安置起机关炮和军用无线电站来。他们派了四个人到桥上去。……过了三秒钟，华界交界线已经退后了二百码……
    “后来我又参加一次‘醉游华界’：海军陆战队长，字林西报记者和我三个人。我们到了华界，那时华界军官有命令，凡是武装外人入界，兵士可以开枪。我那天穿的是便服，可是身上带着枪，没走多远，我们已经醉得很了：我们闯进‘苏俄奸细的屋子’；我们之中，只我有武器，我就拿起枪来向天花板上放。这样一来，我们可以说立刻征服了这个区域的居民，我们就在此地‘起造地狱’，一直到天明。”
