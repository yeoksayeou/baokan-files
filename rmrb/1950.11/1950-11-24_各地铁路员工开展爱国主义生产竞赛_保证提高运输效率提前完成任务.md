Railway Employees Across the Country Launch Patriotic Production Competition
Guaranteeing Increased Transportation Efficiency and Early Completion of Tasks

[Report from this newspaper] An unprecedented patriotic production campaign, sparked by the effort to resist America and aid Korea and defend our homes and country, is vigorously unfolding among railway workers across the nation.

Learning from Xu Guochen's Heroic and Dauntless Spirit to Complete Transportation Tasks with a Fighting Stance

The slogan proposed by the 220,000 railway workers in Northeast China is: Learn from the spirit of Train No. 3005 and Xu Guochen, who feared no hardship and was heroic and dauntless, and resolutely complete transportation tasks with a fighting stance. Railway workers in the Tumen area, on the border between China and North Korea, are working doubly hard to consolidate national defense. The famous Cui Xianfeng shunting team in the area told everyone: No matter what the circumstances, we will definitely stick to our posts, ensure transportation, and consolidate the motherland's border defense! Zhang Bingfa, a locomotive co-driver from a certain locomotive section in the Chaoyangchuan area, has already realized the glorious railway worker's oath with his heroic actions. Zhang Bingfa recently encountered a shameless attack by American planes while on duty at the Meihe Branch Bureau. He never left the locomotive. When four enemy planes strafed at low altitude, Zhang Bingfa discovered that the boiler water level had dropped to the lowest level. He hurriedly pulled the water pump to release water and suppress the fire. The enemy planes turned back and strafed again. The shovel in his hand was broken by bullets, but he still insisted on doing his job on the locomotive. The "Iron Ox Team" members throughout Northeast China have expressed their willingness to go to Korea to participate in transportation work. Wang Furong, the driver of the 688 Youth Contract Team of the Jilin Locomotive Depot, said: We will never allow any imperialists to drag us back from a life of freedom and happiness to a state of cruel oppression. Liu Yu, the driver of Locomotive No. 613, recalling the miserable life in the puppet Manchukuo era, cried and said: "It was not a human life, I have had enough! I have eaten enough acorn flour! We must never be slaves again."

Railway Workers in Northeast China Launch the "Five Hundred Kilometer" Movement

The transportation department of the Northeast Railway Bureau proposed: Use all our strength, give full play to everyone's wisdom and creativity, greatly improve vehicle utilization efficiency, and overcome the difficulty of vehicle shortage. To achieve this task, the "Five Hundred Kilometer" movement is being further developed in the Northeast China railway area. Its goal is to achieve five hundred kilometers of travel per locomotive per day and night. This is a further development of the "Iron Ox Movement" of the Northeast Railway. In the three months of July, August, and September, this movement saved the Northeast Railway an additional 805 locomotive days (one day of locomotive use per locomotive) compared to the original plan. Currently, all departments of the railway, including vehicle, engineering, machinery, and electricity, are further cooperating closely to shorten various technical operation times through collective efforts.

Mao Zedong Locomotive Driver Li Yong Takes the Lead in Launching the Over-Axle Movement

The slogan proposed by the Tianjin Railway Bureau workers is: "Complete the annual task ahead of schedule." The workers of the Fengtai Locomotive Depot, led by Li Yong, the driver of the Mao Zedong locomotive, launched the "Over-Axle Movement." From the end of October to November 15, the tonnage of goods transported by locomotives generally exceeded the bureau's standard by 10% to 15%. On November 17, driver Li Yong and stokers Zhang Yuhai and Wang Qingquan drove temporary cargo train No. 2340 from Tianjin back to Fengtai, hauling 55 freight cars with a total load of 2,377 tons, exceeding the original standard of 2,000 tons by 18.9%. When the train passed by, the workers at each station along the line welcomed and sent it off with gongs and drums. The Fengtai Station even dispatched a waist drum team and a band, presenting flags and flowers, and cheering thunderously. In response to the over-axle movement proposed by Li Yong, Locomotive No. 1232 of the Shanghai Locomotive Depot under the Shanghai Railway Bureau successfully over-transported 484 tons from Changzhou to Shanghai on October 28. This experiment effectively promoted the development of the over-axle movement in the bureau. The Tie Niu (Iron Ox) Locomotive Contract Team of the Suihua Locomotive Depot, one of the national locomotive banners, challenged the Mao Zedong Locomotive, where Li Yong works, guaranteeing that there would be no accidents, major or minor, in the fourth quarter, achieving over-axle operation, further completing 500 kilometers per car per day, and saving 20% of costs.

Beijing Railway Workers Want to Avenge Wang Endi

The workers of the Beijing Branch Bureau of the Tianjin Railway Bureau have adapted the brutality of American soldiers shooting and killing shunting worker Wang Endi at the Beijing West Railway Station in 1946 into a play entitled "Turning Grief into Strength." The workers are using the method of transporting one more ton of cargo and adding one more point of strength to avenge the dead and the insulted. The Youth First Inspection Team of the Tianjin Inspection Section usually inspected two vehicles a day, but in the competition, they created a record of inspecting three vehicles a day. Under the slogan "The factory is the battlefield, and the machine is the weapon," all the workers of the Changxindian Railway Factory decided to challenge the factories directly under the Ministry of Railways with conditions such as completing the annual maintenance task ahead of schedule.

In addition, the Nanjing Locomotive Depot has achieved the glorious record of 300,000 kilometers of safe travel and continues to strive for 400,000 kilometers of safe travel and the victory of the second safe month to ensure the completion of the annual transportation task. Wang Yongxiang, a labor model from the Changsha Engineering Section of the Hengyang Railway Bureau, launched a challenge to the worker brothers in Hunan, proposing conditions such as raising vigilance, strengthening anti-espionage, investigating and eliminating rumors, saving raw materials, improving quality, and completing and exceeding tasks.

　　各地铁路员工开展爱国主义生产竞赛
    保证提高运输效率提前完成任务
    【本报讯】为抗美援朝保家卫国所掀起的空前规模的爱国主义生产大竞赛，正在全国各地铁路职工中蓬勃开展。
    学习徐国臣英勇果敢的精神以战斗的姿态完成运输任务
    东北二十二万铁路职工所提出的口号是：学习第三○○五次列车和徐国臣不怕艰险英勇果敢的精神，以战斗的姿态坚决完成运输任务。工作在中朝边界图们地区的铁路职工，都在加倍紧张的为巩固国防而努力。该地区闻名的崔贤凤调车组向大家表示：无论在任何情况下，我们一定坚守岗位，保证运输，巩固祖国的边防！该地区朝阳川机务段某机车副司机张秉发，已经以自己的英勇行动实现了光荣的铁路工人的誓言：张秉发最近在梅河分局出勤时，遭遇到美机无耻的袭击，他始终没有离开机车。当四架敌机低空扫射时，张秉发发现锅炉水位降到最低程度，他急忙拉水泵放水，压火，敌机又折返扫射。他手中的铁锹被子弹打断，但他仍坚持在机车上干自己的工作。东北全路的“铁牛队员”们更纷纷表示志愿赴朝参加运输工作。吉林机务段六八八青年包车组司机王福荣说：我们决不容许任何帝国主义把我们从自由幸福的生活中再拖回残酷压迫的境地。六一三号机车司机刘玉回忆起在伪满时代的悲惨生活，痛哭流涕地说：“不是人的生活，我受够了！橡子面我吃够了！我们决不能再作亡国奴。”
    东北全区铁路职工开展“五百公里”运动
    东北铁路局运输部门提出：拿出一切力量，发挥每个人的智慧和创造性，高度提高车辆运用效率，战胜车辆不足的困难。为实现这一任务，现东北全区铁路正进一步开展“五百公里”运动，其目标是实现每台机车一昼夜行驶五百公里。这是东北铁路“铁牛运动”的进一步发展。这一运动，在七、八、九三个月内已使东北全区机车使用较原计划节省了八百零五个机车日（每台机车使用一天为一个机车日）。现全路车、工、机、电各部门正进一步密切配合，在集体努力下，缩短各种技术作业时间。
    毛泽东号司机李永带头发动超轴运动
    天津铁路局职工提出的竞赛口号是：“提前完成全年任务”。丰台机务段职工在毛泽东号司机李永的带动下，开展了“超轴运动”。由十月末到十一月十五日止，机车运货吨数普遍超过局定标准百分之十到百分之十五。司机李永及司炉张玉海、王清泉于十一月十七日，自天津开二三四○次临时货物列车回丰台，牵引货车五十五辆，共载重二、三七七吨，超过原定标准二、○○○吨的百分之十八·九。当该列车经过时，沿线各站职工，敲锣打鼓，欢迎欢送。丰台站更出动了腰鼓队和乐队，献旗献花，欢呼雷动。为响应李永提出的超轴运动，上海铁路局所属上海机务段机车一二三二号于十月二十八日由常州至上海，曾超运四八四吨成功。这一试验有效地推动了该局超轴运动的开展。全国机车旗帜之一的绥化机务段铁牛号机车包车组，向李永所在的毛泽东号机车挑战，保证在第四季度中不出大小事故，做到超轴运行，进一步完成日车五百公里，并节省成本百分之二十。
    北京铁路职工要为王恩弟报仇
    天津铁路局北京分局的职工把一九四六年美国兵在北京西车站枪杀调车员王恩弟的暴行编成了剧本，剧名为“化悲愤为力量”。职工们正在用多运一吨货多增加一分力量的方法，为死者与被侮辱者报仇。天津检车段青年甲检组，平时每天甲检两辆，竞赛中创造了每天甲检三辆的纪录。长辛店铁路工厂全体职工们在“工厂就是战场，机器就是武器”的口号下，决定以提前完成全年检修任务等条件，向铁道部直属各工厂挑战。
    此外，南京机务段已达到三十万安全行走公里的光辉纪录，并继续争取四十万安全行走公里和第二个安全月的胜利，以保证全年运输任务的完成。衡阳铁路局长沙工务段劳模王永祥所领导的铁工班向全湖南工人弟兄发起挑战，提出提高警惕加强防特，追查与肃清谣言，节省原料，提高质量，完成并超过任务等条件。
