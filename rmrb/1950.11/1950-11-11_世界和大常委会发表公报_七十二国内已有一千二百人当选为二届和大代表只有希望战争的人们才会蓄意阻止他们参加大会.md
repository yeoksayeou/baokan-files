Xinhua News Agency, Paris, November 10th: The World Peace Council Standing Committee has issued a communiqué regarding the preparations for the Second World Peace Congress, stating: "The Standing Committee has been notified that 1,200 representatives have been elected from 72 countries around the world to participate in the Second World Peace Congress. To date, representatives from Australia, the United States, Argentina, Ceylon, and other countries have arrived in the United Kingdom. Delegations from China, Colombia, Korea, Mongolia, India, Burma, and other countries have arrived in Europe. The French and Italian delegations, which are the largest, are scheduled to depart on the 11th. As of the 10th, some representatives from various countries have obtained entry visas."

The Secretariat of the World Peace Council Standing Committee stated that the British government has refused to issue entry visas to many representatives. These representatives have differing political and religious beliefs. The British government's action, which violates the great tradition of freedom of the British people and contravenes the cause of peace, will result in the inability of delegations from many countries to arrive in the United Kingdom in their entirety. The representatives attending this congress have only one purpose: to hold free discussions to seek the consolidation of the precarious peace. Only those who hope for war would deliberately prevent them from attending the congress.

The Secretariat of the World Peace Council Standing Committee believes that "all freedom-loving people around the world, especially the freedom-loving people of Britain, will support all efforts aimed at obtaining democratic guarantees for holding the Second World Peace Congress."

　　世界和大常委会发表公报
    七十二国内已有一千二百人当选为二届和大代表只有希望战争的人们才会蓄意阻止他们参加大会
    【新华社十日讯】塔斯社巴黎十日讯：世界保卫和平大会常设委员会顷发表关于第二届世界保卫和平大会筹备经过的公报称：“常设委员会先后得到通知：在全世界的七十二个国家内，已有一千二百人被选为参加第二届世界保卫和平大会的代表。迄今为止，澳大利亚、美国、阿根廷、锡兰等国代表，已到达英国。中国、哥伦比亚、朝鲜、蒙古、印度、缅甸等国代表团已经到达欧洲。人数最多的法国及意大利两代表团定于十一日启程。截至十日止，已有各国若干代表获得入境签证。”
    世界保卫和平大会常设委员会秘书处称：英国政府拒绝发入境签证给许多代表。这些代表是政治信仰及宗教信仰各不尽同的人。英国政府这种违背英国人民伟大的自由传统，违背和平事业的行动，结果将使许多国家的代表团没有一个能够全体到达英国。参加这次大会的代表，只有一个目的，就是举行自由讨论以谋求巩固岌岌可危的和平。只有希望战争的人们才会蓄意制止他们参加大会。
    世界保卫和平大会常设委员会秘书处相信：“全世界一切爱好自由的人民，特别是英国爱好自由的人民，都会支持旨在获得举行第二届世界保卫和平大会的民主保障的种种努力。”
