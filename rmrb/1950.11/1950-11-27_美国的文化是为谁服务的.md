Who Does American Culture Serve?
	Professor Feng Youlan of Tsinghua University

Who does American culture serve? Of course, it serves its ruling class, the bourgeoisie. This is very clear, no matter which part of its culture you look at. Let's start with American universities.

American universities are completely controlled by financial groups. The highest authority is the board of directors. The directors are, of course, all wealthy capitalists. The person who exercises all the administrative power in the university on behalf of the board of directors is the president appointed by the board. The board's criteria for selecting the president are not his academic contributions or educational experience, but his ability to raise money for the school and serve the wealthy capitalists.

In 1947, "Reader's Digest" (a widely circulated American magazine) published this story. An American man, working as a manager in a company in India, suddenly thought one night that it would be interesting to be a university president. The next day, he resigned and returned to the United States, first inquiring at several famous universities about what courses a person preparing to be a university president should study. He was very disappointed because no university offered specialized courses specifically for people preparing to be university presidents, nor were there university president training classes or the like. But just as he was disappointed, the president of a college in a small town became vacant. He quickly flew to find the directors, telling them that he was very interested in being a university president. The directors, of course, were also company managers and the like, and they hit it off. Sure enough, they appointed him as president. After taking office, he was very good at raising money and added some buildings. He also invented a method of having the companies in the town set up scholarships at his school. The students who received these scholarships were selected by the companies themselves. Students who received scholarships from a company were guaranteed to work for that company after graduation.

This is a true story with real names and places. It seems a bit humorous to us. In fact, university presidents in the United States are essentially this type of person. For example, the new presidents of two famous American universities in the past two or three years can be cited as examples. One of these new presidents is Dwight Eisenhower of Columbia University. He was the commander of the Allied forces in Western Europe during World War II. Everyone knows this person. The other is Harold Stassen of the University of Pennsylvania. He served as governor for one term. During the last American presidential election, he announced his candidacy two years in advance. With this self-proclaimed qualification as a presidential candidate, he went to Europe to talk to the authorities of various countries. Since World War II, the United States has been outwardly strong but inwardly weak in every aspect, especially in ideology. People generally feel anxious and worried about the domestic and international situation, without any solutions or confidence. Many people fantasize that European countries might have some solutions (such as the recent American talk about borrowing "guerrilla experts" from Britain). Therefore, some people increase their worth by going to Europe for "inspection." Stassen used this method to go to Europe, making a big fuss as his political capital. As a result, although he was not elected president, he managed to get a university presidency.

Like these two presidents, one a thorough military man, the other a thorough politician, their knowledge of running a university is probably not much higher than that of the man who started as a company manager in India.

Such a president, holding the power of the school, manages the school through his trusted "directors" and the like. The "directors" are the ones who "manage" the professors. American university professors hate these people who "manage" them the most. They have given a definition to "directors," saying that "a 'director' is a person who has too much knowledge to be a president and not enough knowledge to be a professor."

Under this system, the relationship between students and the university is like the relationship between customers and a store. The university, on the one hand, tries its best to set up various courses to attract students. However, students cannot interfere with the university's main affairs and basic policies. The university's attitude is: if you think my goods don't suit your taste, you have the "freedom" to go elsewhere.

The relationship between the university and the professors is like the relationship between employers and employees. Professors also cannot interfere with the university's main affairs and basic policies. The university's attitude is: you take my money, and you must teach what I tell you to teach. You have no "right" to interfere with other things. If you think I am not a good employer, you have the "freedom" to go elsewhere.

Under feudalism, the education for men was to train them how to be slaves to the emperor. The education for women was to train them how to be daughters-in-law in their husbands' families. Education under the bourgeoisie trains people how to be employees for capitalists. The scholarship method implemented by that president who started as a company manager in India is actually the regularization of the general situation in universities. In general universities, the candidate employees trained each year go to the "free market" to find their employers. And this president's method is to let employers pre-select their future employees, just like raising child brides in feudal rural China.

Under this system, most university graduates develop an employment-oriented perspective. This perspective is the perspective held by most Americans when doing things. The lives of most Americans are dominated by this perspective. Arriving at the employer's place on time, doing whatever they are told to do, and going home to rest and entertain as soon as the quitting time arrives. They don't think about other issues, nor do they feel that there are other issues to think about.

Therefore, Americans are the least philosophical. Last year, a philosophy professor at Columbia University wrote a book satirizing Americans' ignorance of philosophy. The book included a story about a philosophy professor who taught an introduction to philosophy and was very popular with students. One of the students made a fortune in business and wanted to "promote" his teacher, so he placed a large advertisement in the newspaper, saying that Professor So-and-so had invented a new American philosophy, "the world's best" (which is what Americans love to hear most). The professor became very popular and received many letters. There were letters from Hollywood saying that they wanted to make his new philosophy into a movie. There were letters from bookstore people saying that they wanted to write his new philosophy into a fairy tale. Many people also invited him to give lectures. Once, at a bank club, his lecture was scheduled alongside a magic show.

This story is fictional, but the fact it satirizes is true. Bourgeoisie financial bosses are only really interested in things that can make them money directly. They regard philosophy and all theoretical knowledge as a kind of toy or decoration, and they also regard people who study philosophy and theoretical knowledge as a kind of decoration.

In my hometown, there is this story. In the past, landlords' families all paid attention to raising carriages and horses. In addition, they also raised a decoration, which was the private school teacher. They called raising carriages and horses "playing with carriages and horses." Once, a landlord complained to others that his situation was not good and he could not afford to "play" with a teacher. The bourgeoisie financial groups in the United States have always considered philosophers and all theoretical issues as things that can only be played with.

But when they find that these philosophical and theoretical things can also be harmful to them, they will unceremoniously persecute and stop them. This is the persecution of the academic community by the American ruling class in recent times, as reported by the scientists who recently returned to the country.

Whether in the case of being played with or being persecuted, the study of knowledge will only degenerate and not develop.

A culture that serves a certain class, if the class it serves is on the decline, it can only follow it on the decline. There is no other way.

### 美国的文化是为谁服务的

　　美国的文化是为谁服务的
    清华大学教授  冯友兰
    美国的文化是为谁服务的？当然是为它的统治阶级、资产阶级服务的。无论从它的文化的那一部分看，都是很清楚的。我们试从美国的大学看起。
    美国的大学，完全是财阀们所控制的机关。它的最高的权力是董事会。董事们当然都是些财阀。代表董事会在大学里面行使用人行政一切大权的，是董事会所任命的校长。董事会选择校长的标准，并不是他在学术上的贡献或教育上的经验而是他为学校弄钱的能力，为财阀们服务的能力。
    一九四七年的《读者文摘》（这是美国一个销行很广的刊物）上刊载了这样一个故事。有一个美国人，在印度一个公司里当经理，忽然一夜，他想起来，当个大学校长很有意思。第二天，他就辞职回国，先到几个著名大学里打听，一个预备作大学校长的人，应该念些什么功课。结果他很失望，因为各大学里都没有专为预备作大学校长的人开的专门课程，也没有大学校长训练班之类。可是正在他失望的时候，有一个小城的学院的校长出缺了。他赶紧飞去找那些董事们，说他对于作大学校长很感觉兴趣。那些董事们当然也都是些公司经理之类，气味想投，果然，就任命他当校长。他就职以后很能弄钱，添盖了些房子。并且他发明了一个办法，叫那个城里的那些公司，都在他的学校里设奖学金。得这些奖学金的学生，由公司自家选定。拿那家公司的奖学金的学生，保证毕业后在那家公司里服务。
    这是一个有名有姓的真人真事。我们看着似乎有点滑稽。其实美国大学的校长，在本质上都是这一类的人。如象近二、三年来美国的两个著名大学的新校长，都可以作例。这两个新校长，一个是哥仑比亚大学的艾森豪威尔。他是第二次世界大战西欧的联军统帅。这个人是大家都知道的。另一个是宾夕福尼亚大学的史塔生。他作过一任州长。在上次美国总统选举的时候，早两年他就宣布要竞选。就以这个自命为总统竞选人的资格，跑到欧洲，找各国的当局谈话。自从第二次大战以后，美国无论在那一方面，都是外强中干的，在思想方面，尤其是贫乏。一般人对于国内外情形，都感觉到焦急，忧虑，没有办法，没有把握。有许多人幻想，欧洲的国家，或者有什么办法。（如象近来美国说要向英国借“游击专家”那种情形）。因此有些人以到欧洲“考察”增加他的身价。史塔生利用这个办法，到欧洲去一趟大吹大擂，作为他的政治资本。结果总统虽没有被选上，可是弄到手了一个大学校长。
    象这两位校长，一个道地的军阀，一个道地的政客，对于办大学的知识，不会比那位在印度作公司经理的人高明多少。
    这样的校长，掌握了学校的大权，凭着他所亲信“主任”之类，管理学校。“主任”们是“管”教授们的。美国的大学教授们最讨厌这些“管”他们的人。他们给“主任”下了一个定义，说“主任”是“一种人当校长学问嫌太多，当教授学问嫌不够。”
    在这种制度下，学生与大学的关系，是如顾客与商店的关系。大学一方面尽力设些五花八门的功课，吸引学生。可是大学的主要校务及基本政策，学生是不能过问的。大学的态度是：你若是嫌我的货不对你的口味，你有到别家去的“自由”。
    大学与教授的关系，是如雇主与雇员的关系。大学的主要校务及基本政策，教授也是不能过问的。大学的态度是：你拿我的钱，我叫你教什么你就必须教什么。别的事你没有“权”管。你若嫌我这个雇主不好，你有到别家去的“自由”。
    封建主义下对于男人的教育，是训练他如何到皇帝那里当奴才。对于女人的教育，是训练她如何到婆家作媳妇。资产阶级下的教育，训练人如何到资本家那里作雇员。上面所说那个以印度公司经理起家的那位校长所实行的那种奖学金的办法，实在就是一般大学的情形的规律化。在一般的大学中，每年所训练出来的候选雇员，都到“自由市场”去找他的雇主。而这位校长的办法，则是让雇主预先选定他的将来的雇员，如同在中国封建农村里养童养媳一样。
    在这种制度下，大多数的大学毕业生都养成一种雇佣观点。这个观点，是大多数美国人作事时候所持的观点。大多数美国人的生活，都是为这个观点所支配的。准时到雇主那里去上班，叫做什么就做什么，下班时间一到，赶紧回家休息娱乐。他们不想别的问题，也不觉得有什么别的问题可想。
    因此美国人是最没有哲学头脑的。前年一位哥仑比亚大学的哲学教授写了一本书，讽刺美国人对于哲学的无知。书中有一个故事，说有一个哲学教授，教哲学概论，很受学生欢迎。其中有一个学生，作生意发了财，想“提拔”一下老师，就在报上大登广告，说某教授发明了一个美国新哲学，“世界第一”（这是美国人最喜欢听的）。这位教授果然大红起来，接到许多信。有好莱坞来的信，说是要把他的新哲学拍成电影。有书店的人来的信，说是要把他的新哲学写成童话。请他讲演的人也很多。有一次一个银行的俱乐部里，把他的讲演与魔术排在一起。
    这个故事是虚构的，不过他所讽刺的那个事实，却是真的。资产阶级的财阀老板们，只对于直接能叫他们赚钱的东西，才感觉到真正的兴趣。哲学及一切关于理论的学问，他们都视为一种玩物或装饰品，研究哲学及理论学问的人物，他们也视为一种装饰品。
    在我的家乡里有这个故事。以前的地主们家里，都讲究养车养马。此外还养一个装饰品，就是教书先生。他们称养车养马为玩车玩马。有一次有一个地主向别人诉苦，说他的光景不好，“玩”不起先生了。美国的资产阶级的财阀们，对于哲学家及一切理论学问题，向来都认为只是可以玩的东西。
    可是等到他们发现这些哲学及理论的东西，也能对于他们有害，他们也就毫不客气地加以迫害制止。这就是美国统治阶级近来对于学术界的迫害，如近来新返国的科学家们所报告的。
    无论在被玩或被迫害的情形下，学问的研究，是只会堕落，不会发展的。
    一个为某一阶级服务的文化，如果它所服务的那个阶级是走下坡路的，它也只有跟着走下坡路，这是没有办法的。
