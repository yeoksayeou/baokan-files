　　US Imperialism Intensifies Japan's Militarization
　  Building Airports by Turning Farmland into Runways, Investigating Demobilized Soldiers, Conspiring to Drive Them as Cannon Fodder
    [Xinhua News Agency, 13th] Disregarding the lives and safety of the Japanese people, the American reactionaries are actively implementing an aggressive policy of militarizing Japan. According to a report by the United Press, the former Japanese Army's Akeno Airfield in Ichishi District, Mie Prefecture, in south-central Honshu, will be restored. Recently, about 100 farming households living near the airfield have received orders from the authorities to move out forcibly. Farmland will be turned into runways. At the site of the former Japanese arsenal in Akabane Village, north of Tokyo, a large amount of earth was moved recently to build a base for an armaments repair factory, causing the collapse of nearby river embankments and making the roads muddy on rainy days. Five hundred residents of the village signed the peace declaration during the two "Peace Signature Days" on October 14th and 15th, expressing their determination to oppose war.
    In Omuta City, Fukuoka Prefecture, the city government investigated the situation of demobilized soldiers throughout the city. They must report any relocation or job change in a timely manner. This investigative measure, which is a conspiracy to mobilize former Japanese military personnel to serve as American cannon fodder, is also being carried out in Iwate Prefecture on Honshu and Kumamoto City in Kyushu.

　　美帝加紧日本军事化
　  修筑机场把农田变成飞机跑道调查复员军人阴谋驱使当炮灰
    【新华社十三日讯】美国反动派不顾日本人民的生活及安全，积极实行使日本军事化的侵略政策。据联合通讯社消息：本州中南部三重县一志郡的前日本陆军明野飞机场又将恢复。最近，住在该机场附近的农民约一百户，已接到当局强制搬家的命令。农田将被变成飞机跑道。东京北部赤羽乡的前日军火药库，最近为了修筑兵器修理工厂的基地，动用了大量泥土，使附近的河堤倒塌，雨天道路泥泞不堪。该乡居民五百人，在十月十四日及十五日两天“和平签名日”中，在和平宣言上签了名，表示他们反对战争的决心。
    在福冈县大牟田市，市政府调查了全市复员军人的情况。他们如有迁移、转业等，都必须及时报告。这一阴谋动员前日本军事人员充当美国炮灰的调查措施，也在本州岩手县及九州熊本市等地进行。
