　　Soviet Experts' Assistance in China's Fuel Industry Construction
    ——Written to Commemorate the October Revolution Day
    ·Fuel Industry Department Communications Group·
    Soviet experts who have been engaged in the construction of Soviet socialist industry love the new China with the spirit of loving their motherland, the Soviet Union. Their Lenin-Stalin-like work style and their selfless work enthusiasm are model practitioners of internationalism. As Vice Chairman Liu Shaoqi said: "Stalin, at the request of the Chinese Communist Party, sent them (Soviet experts—author's note) to serve in China, instructing them to tell the Chinese people all their knowledge and skills, and when the Chinese people can learn and manage their factories and enterprises without difficulty and without the need for their service in China, they will return to the Soviet Union. They came to China, and China assigned their work. When they were assigned to various factories, enterprises, and economic organizations, they worked under the leadership of the Chinese heads of those factories, enterprises, and organizations. They only acted as consultants, and their salaries were only equivalent to those of Chinese engineers, not like British and American engineers who received very high salaries."

    Thanks to the assistance of Soviet experts, China's coal, electricity, and petroleum industries have made great progress. These achievements are inseparable from the Soviet experts under the wise leadership of Stalin.

    I. In the Coal Mining Industry

    Taking China's coal mine construction as an example, China's coal mining industry has long been under the rule of imperialism and bureaucratic capital. Most of the mines are shallow, small, inclined shafts using indigenous methods of coal mining, lacking necessary machinery, and the above-ground equipment is crude. The mining method is predatory, and the loss in mining thick coal seams is more than 70%. There are no technically-based rules for dealing with rock strata pressure and mine engineering supports. Underground ventilation is poor, many heavy tasks rely on cheap human labor, and casualties occur constantly. The working conditions of the miners are terribly harsh. China lacks coal mining technicians, and there are no reliable statistics. Under these circumstances, it is difficult to quickly build China's coal mines into the same kind as the socialist Soviet Union's coal mines.

    However, Soviet coal mining experts are the most capable people at overcoming difficulties. They suggested that we re-examine the previous geological data and establish specialized statistical agencies to lay the foundation for the long-term development of China's coal industry. They also helped us establish coal industry organizations at all levels, formulate various plans, guide technical reforms, use simple mechanization methods to change coal mining methods, solve technical security problems, improve labor efficiency, reduce coal costs, and suggested abolishing the foreman system to change management methods. In addition, they also prepared to gradually adopt a progressive wage system.

    With the help of Soviet experts, new mining methods have been adopted in most coal mines. Coal seams as thick as three meters in Jixi, Hegang, Xi'an, Fengfeng and other mines have adopted longwall mining along the strike, comprehensive mining for coal seams below 1.3 meters, and layered mining with caving filling for thick coal seams above 3.5 meters. Heavy and strenuous work is gradually being replaced by machinery: hand-held rock drills and fixed electric drills have replaced manual tunnel excavation, endless rope, winches and chain-plate coal conveyors have replaced manual handling in the mining fields, and heavy coal cutting machines have replaced manual cutting. These changes have been gradually implemented in coal mines in Northeast, North and East China.

    New records are constantly being created: after implementing the new coal mining methods suggested by Soviet experts, the general recovery rate has reached more than 80%, and production efficiency has more than doubled. The Soviet advanced method of rapid roadway driving enabled the Hongshan Coal Mine to create a record of 7.4 meters per day in tunnel excavation. The mining height of the Fushun open-pit coal mine was increased from 10 meters to 12 meters. In the steeply inclined coal seams of the Huainan Coal Mine, the comprehensive mining method of the reverse ladder-shaped field was used, and coal miner Zhu Hanzhang created a new record of 34 tons of coal in five hours, which is very close to the initial record of the Soviet Stakhanov. All these new records are inseparable from the technical guidance of Soviet experts.

    Soviet coal mining experts with great internationalist spirit pay special attention to the technical safety problems of mines. Major casualties caused by falling rocks, falling coal, water penetration from old workings, and gas explosions are particularly intolerable to Soviet experts. They believe that "the traditional chaos built on the basis of using cheap labor and predatory mining must be eradicated." They pointed out: "Most unfortunate incidents occur because there are no unified technical operating procedures, technical safety regulations, and insufficient sense of responsibility among engineering and technical personnel for their own tasks." At the coal mine conference in May of this year, Soviet experts said: "We ask you to resolutely improve the means of technical security! We ask you to supply air to the mines and to the working faces! You do not have enough coal cutting machines and equipment for the time being, but air does not need to be imported from abroad. Please give sufficient air to the miners, labor heroes, and enthusiastic workers! Please show concern for the most precious glorious workers in the coal industry – the miners!"

    Soviet experts actively suggested the formulation of unified technical safety regulations, designed mine ventilation systems and air volume standards, suggested mine fall-prevention devices and the specifications of shaft roadway diameters, various protective equipment, and inspection methods for lifting steel wire ropes, and introduced the "Calculation Method of Air Volume in Mines" created by Academician Skochinsky of the Soviet Academy of Sciences. They also formulated more complete prevention and fire extinguishing methods for underground coal spontaneous combustion in various mines of the Fushun Mining Bureau.

    Soviet experts love the new China with the spirit of loving their great motherland, the Soviet Union. With their help, the repair shops of various mining bureaus and the machinery factories of various coal mines have begun to formulate work plans for manufacturing mining machinery and have begun to manufacture some machines that were previously considered necessary to be imported from abroad. This is an important key to freeing China's coal mining industry from the shackles of colonialism. Many coal mines have begun to use self-made coal cutting machines, coal conveyors, rock drills, electric drills, and other tools in the field. Some coal mines have adopted a planned mechanical maintenance method.

    According to statistics from December 1949 to September 1950, Soviet coal mining experts gave 70 special reports and held more than 50 symposiums for leading cadres and employees of major state-owned coal mines. In all the reports and symposiums, a total of more than 9,000 leading cadres engaged in coal mining work attended.

    II. In the Electrical Industry

    The primary contribution of Soviet electrical experts after arriving in China was to break the blind, laissez-faire and backward management methods that had long existed under the rule of imperialism and bureaucratic capital, and to correct the serious conservative, paralyzed, and irresponsible erroneous thinking that existed among power industry workers.

    At the first National Electricity Conference convened by the Central Fuel Industry Department in February of this year, Soviet electrical experts proposed that a planned maintenance system must be implemented in order to maximize the efficiency of equipment and ensure that machines reach their nameplate output. At that time, the conservative thinking of most power industry workers was still very strong, and they expressed some doubts and could not accept this proposal. They believed that most of the machines in their own experience had never reached nameplate output, and that the machines were even more dilapidated now, so how could they guarantee that they could exert their full potential? However, actual events ruthlessly shattered the old conservative thinking. With the Soviet experts personally providing specific assistance to power plants across the country, the main equipment of power plants in various places was greatly improved after major overhauls, and the output of various equipment was significantly improved, especially the Shijingshan Power Plant in Beijing and the Fushun Power Plant in Northeast China, which had 100% achieved nameplate output. From a national perspective, after the implementation of the periodic maintenance system, it is estimated that the average possible output of state-owned power industry equipment across the country can reach 85% in 1950, which is sufficient to supply the needs of industry and people's livelihoods in various places, so that the recovery of China's economy can be accelerated.

    In the production system, thanks to the suggestions and assistance of Soviet experts, advanced quota management, responsibility system, and economic accounting systems have been initially established. Therefore, a lot of materials and manpower have been saved, the production cost of the power industry has been gradually reduced, and electricity prices have been reduced in individual areas, supplying more, higher quality, and cheaper electricity.

    Soviet experts not only introduced their advanced technical standards to the Chinese power industry, but also, based on China's actual conditions, suggested many reforms in the management organization of power plants (such as the implementation of a field responsibility system, etc.), so that power plants in various places have gradually broken away from the shackles of the formalistic bureaucratic institutions of the past and gradually moved towards scientific management. For example, after the organizational structures of Shijingshan and Fushun power plants were improved, work efficiency has been significantly improved.

    After arriving at each power plant, Soviet experts first understood the actual situation, and then gradually put forward opinions for reform, and discussed and studied them collectively with the workers of each plant. For example, regarding the balance problem when overhauling the No. 6 generator of the Shijingshan Power Plant, because the mechanical equipment of the plant and the Beijing area could not solve this problem, the Soviet experts proposed the "electric measurement balance method" and mobilized the masses to discuss it, relying on the wisdom and efforts of the masses to obtain a solution.

    In addition, no matter which power plant, wherever the Soviet experts had been, they put forward dozens of specific suggestions for improving various tasks. For example, in the Shijingshan, Tianjin, Tangshan, Taiyuan, Nanjing, and Huainan power plants, the suggestions of the Soviet experts are being gradually implemented, and practice has proved that these suggestions are the most correct and most valuable. Therefore, the workers of the power plants now say from the bottom of their hearts: "The Soviet big brother can really help us solve problems!" During the year or so of harmonious coexistence, the relationship between the Soviet experts and the Chinese power industry workers is very harmonious and is still continuing to increase. Although they do not speak the same language, warm handshakes and kind smiles convey the deep friendship between the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union.

    The working attitude of Soviet experts is meticulous, and they strictly implement the plan immediately after it is made. With their help, China's state-owned power industry has gradually established a reasonable labor organization, labor discipline, and work system, so that power industry production can continue to progress and efficiency can continue to improve.

    Our staff often easily request the state to allocate foreign exchange to order equipment from abroad due to engineering needs, and the numbers are often very large. When Soviet experts saw this situation, they said to our technicians with a sincere attitude: "You are still an economically difficult country, do not let funds flow out casually. Some things can be made in your own country. We are always ready to contribute our technology to help you make equipment." We accepted the suggestions of the Soviet experts, thus reducing a lot of unnecessary foreign orders and saving the country a lot of foreign exchange expenditures. Soviet experts do not want us to use valuable funds to buy a large number of new equipment from abroad, but to try their best to help us improve the efficiency of the original machines and make them run like new machines.

    In the short period of one year, the assistance given to us by Soviet experts is really too numerous to mention. Taking only the Shijingshan Power Plant as an example, they have put forward as many as 300 suggestions, and according to the plant's statistics in July of this year, about 50% have been implemented, and the remaining suggestions can be gradually implemented by the end of this year.

    For the future of China's power industry, Soviet experts have contributed their advanced scientific and technological knowledge and rich work experience, and pointed out the direction of our power industry work. Their labor attitude is our best example.

    III. In the Petroleum Industry

    China's petroleum industry is still a seedling. There is a lot of work to be done in this emerging industry, and we are also very eager for the help of all advanced technologies. Last year, just as we were vigorously restoring industrial production, Soviet petroleum experts with great internationalist spirit and a high degree of work enthusiasm, full of brotherly friendship, were invited to our country to help us complete the great and arduous construction tasks as soon as possible.

    The footprints of Soviet petroleum experts first reached the Yumen Oil Mine in Gansu. Yumen is located in the great northwest of China, where there is no grass, no trees, and no clear springs. It is a vast desert. However, it contains rich oil resources. Because Soviet experts recognized the important position of Yumen in China's petroleum industry, they went there without hesitation, regardless of hardship and danger.

    The high working enthusiasm of Soviet experts is amazing. After they arrived in Yumen, they lived a hard life like the Chinese workers. They conducted in-depth research and analysis of all aspects of Yumen Oil Mine's exploration, drilling, oil extraction, and refining with almost no rest. When they came back, they gave us many suggestions and criticisms very enthusiastically. In terms of drilling, they pointed out that due to our lack of calculation and construction plans, we cannot correctly calculate drilling costs and cannot assess work progress. In terms of oil extraction, they pointed out that we have never done any underground repair work on oil mines in the past, and we lack an underground repair team, so we have not repaired and utilized some temporarily closed oil wells, and the oil production of existing oil wells has not been improved. In response to these situations, Soviet experts suggested that we use the axial straight-line row mining method to replace the currently used gradual dense mining method. In addition, when drilling all new exploration wells, the entire core should be drilled and the electrical core measurement method should be used. It was also suggested that an underground repair team should be established quickly in the mine, and a meeting of petroleum geological experts should be held to discuss the work of strengthening geological exploration to determine the priority of drilling various petroleum structures. These facts illustrate the sincere concern of Soviet petroleum experts for us.

    At the first National Petroleum Industry Conference of the new China, Soviet experts participated in the conference tirelessly and gave us many opinions on exploration, drilling, and refining. Especially when we formulated future drilling plans, they gave us significant and valuable assistance. The Soviet experts seriously criticized our unrealistic, general, and huge drilling plans, and based on their valuable and rich experience, combined with the actual situation of China's manpower, equipment and materials, and technical level, they proposed a plan for focusing on drilling work. At the same time, they also negated the seasonal drilling organization system left over from the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries in the past, pointing out that seasonal drilling work cannot guarantee the normal progress of oil field development work, wastes skilled drilling cadres, hinders them from systematically improving their technology, and makes it difficult to train new drilling cadres, so that drilling work cannot achieve the necessary progress and growth. And more importantly, their great working spirit as socialists gave us a significant ideological impact. When they talked about our not drilling in winter and some technicians believing that drilling in winter is difficult or uneconomical, they introduced to us the actual situation of Soviet petroleum industry workers carrying out drilling work in winter. They said: "Soviet petroleum workers have never stopped our drilling work in areas where the winter temperature reaches minus 50 degrees Celsius and the snow is one meter thick, in such difficult environments and severe cold climates." As for the issue of "drilling in winter is not economical," Soviet experts said, "As long as our organizational work is done well, the cost of drilling in winter can be compensated." This working attitude gave a very profound lesson to some of our technicians who have conservative ideas and lack enthusiasm for work, and at the same time clearly pointed out the path we should take in drilling work in the future.

    The exploration of oil resources in the Great Northwest is one of the key points of our work in the next two or three years, so it is necessary to order drilling rigs, drill pipes, drill bits, and many other equipment from abroad. Soviet experts have given us a lot of specific help in this regard. They gave us opinions on which equipment should be ordered more, which equipment should be ordered less, and which can be temporarily not ordered, carefully and responsibly, so as to avoid wasting valuable foreign exchange funds. At the same time, they further encouraged us: "Although manufacturing drilling equipment in China is not as economical and easy as ordering equipment from abroad, you should also try your best to gradually make some equipment yourself, because this is the only correct path you should take." This more fully demonstrates how noble and great the style of outstanding people educated by Lenin and Stalin is. Only they can truly dedicate their love for their own country to their brotherly allies in the same way. This is absolutely incomparable to the liars and spies sent by American imperialism to China to carry out economic aggression activities in the past!

    The help of Soviet experts to us is reflected in all aspects. With their help, China will inevitably embark on the road of industrialization rapidly. Today, when American imperialism is frantically carrying out aggressive wars, our strong national defense army and strong economic power will be even stronger with the help of Soviet experts. Let the imperialist aggressors tremble in front of the people of China and the Soviet Union!

　　苏联专家对于中国燃料工业建设的帮助
    ——为纪念苏联十月革命节而作
    ·燃料工业部通讯组·
    曾经从事于苏维埃社会主义工业建设的苏联专家们，以热爱祖国苏联的精神热爱着新中国。他们的列宁斯大林般的工作方式，他们的忘我的工作热忱，是国际主义精神的模范实践者。正如刘少奇副主席说的：“斯大林应中国共产党之请，派遣他们（苏联专家—作者注）到中国来服务，指示他们要把所有的一切知识和技能告诉中国人，什么时候中国人能够学会，能够没有困难地管理他们的工厂和企业，而不需要他们在中国服务的时候，他们就回苏联去。他们来到中国，由中国分配他们的工作，在他们被分配到各工厂、各企业和各经济机关去的时候，他们在各工厂、企业和机关的中国负责人领导之下工作，他们只做顾问，他们的薪资，只领取和中国同等工程师一样的薪资，而不是如英国美国工程师一样，领取很高的薪资。”
    由于苏联专家的帮助，中国的煤矿、电力和石油工业，有了很大的进步。这些功绩的取得是与斯大林英明领导的苏联专家分不开的。
    一、在煤矿工业方面
    就以中国的煤矿建设来说，中国煤矿工业长期在帝国主义及官僚资本的统治下，大多数矿井是浅小的用土法采煤的斜井，缺乏应有的机械，地上只有简陋的设备。开采方法是掠夺式的，开采厚煤层时的损失达百分之七十以上。对于岩层压力的处理与矿井工程的支柱，根本没有任何技术上有根据的规则。井下通风不良，许多笨重的工作是倚靠廉价的人力劳动，伤亡事故不断地发生，矿工们的工作条件艰苦得可怕。中国缺乏煤矿技术人员，连可靠的统计资料都没有。在这种情况下，要想把中国煤矿迅速地建设成像社会主义苏联的煤矿那样是很困难的。
    但是苏联煤矿专家是最善于克服困难的人们。他们建议我们重新审查从前的地质资料，成立专门的统计机构，为中国煤矿工业打下百年大计的基础。又帮助我们建立了煤矿工业的各级组织机构，制订了各种计划，指导技术改革，利用简单的机械化方法，改变采煤方法，解决技术保安问题，提高劳动效率，减低煤炭成本，并建议取消把头制度改变管理方法。此外，也准备逐渐采用累进的工资制度。
    在苏联专家的帮助下，多数煤矿中采用了新式采煤方法。像鸡西、鹤岗、西安、峰峰等矿厚达三公尺的煤层，都采用了按走向的长壁式采煤法，一点三公尺以下的煤层采用全面采煤法，三点五公尺以上的厚煤层采用陷落充填的分层采掘方法。笨重吃力的工作也逐步为机械所代替：手提风钻和固定电钻代替了人工的巷道掘进，无极绳，绞车和链板式运煤机代替了采煤场子里的人工搬运，而重型的截煤机又代替人力进行了刨槽工作。这些改变，已经在东北、华北和华东等区的煤矿逐渐地实行了。
    新纪录不断地产生着：实行了苏联专家所建议的新采煤方法以后，一般的回收率达到百分之八十以上，生产效率提高了一倍以上。苏联先进的快速送道的方法，使洪山煤矿的巷道掘进创造了每日七点四公尺的纪录。抚顺露天煤矿的采掘高度由十公尺增加到十二公尺。在淮南煤矿的急倾斜煤层中，使用了倒楼梯形场子的全面采掘法，采煤工朱汉章创造了五小时采煤三十四吨的新纪录，和苏联斯塔哈诺夫的初期纪录已极接近。所有这些新纪录的创造，都是与苏联专家的技术指导分不开的。
    具有伟大国际主义精神的苏联煤矿专家们，特别注意到矿山的技术保安问题。由于落石、落煤、老空透水和瓦斯爆炸所引起的重大伤亡事件，是使苏联专家特别不能容忍的。他们认为“必须将这种建筑在利用廉价劳动力及掠夺式采煤基础上的传统的混乱现象加以根除。”他们指出：“大多数不幸事件的发生是由于没有统一的技术运行规程、技术保安规程及工程技术人员对其自身所负任务的责任心不够。”在今年五月的煤矿会议上，苏联专家说：“我们请求诸位坚决地改善技术保安的手段！我们请求诸位向矿井内、向场子面供给空气！诸位暂时没有足用的割煤机与机器设备，但是空气并不需要从外国输入。请给矿工们、劳动英雄们、热心的工作者们以充分的空气！请诸位对于最可宝贵的煤矿工业中的光荣的劳动者——矿工们，表示关切！”
    苏联专家积极地建议制订统一的技术保安规程，设计了矿井通风系统和风量标准，建议矿井的防坠装置和井筒巷道口径的规格，各种保护设备及提升用的钢丝绳的检查方法，更介绍了苏联科学院院士司客臣斯基创始的“矿井中空气数量的计算方法”。对抚顺矿务局各矿地下煤炭自燃发火也拟定了更完善的预防与灭火的办法。
    苏联专家以热爱其伟大祖国苏联的精神爱护着新中国。在他们的帮助下，各矿务局的修理厂和各煤矿的机械厂都已开始编制制造矿山机械的工作计划，并且开始制造一部分从前认为必须从外国输入的机器了。这是使新中国的煤矿工业摆脱殖民地桎梏的重要关键。许多煤矿开始在场子上使用自制的截煤机、运煤机、风钻、电钻和其他工具。某些煤矿采用了有计划的机械检修方法。
    据一九四九年十二月至一九五○年九月的统计，苏联煤矿专家向各大国营煤矿的领导干部和职工作过七十次的专题报告，开过五十多次座谈会。在历次报告及座谈会中，参加听讲的煤矿工作的领导干部总计有九千余人。
    二、在电气工业方面
    苏联电气专家到中国后的首要贡献，就是打破了过去在帝国主义和官僚资本长期统治下的盲目自流与落后的经营方式，纠正了在电业职工中严重存在着的保守、麻痹和不负责任的错误思想。
    在今年二月中央燃料工业部召开的第一次全国电业会议上，苏联电气专家们提出：必须实行有计划的检修制度，才能发挥设备的全部效能，保证机器达到其名牌出力。当时大部分电业职工的保守思想还十分浓厚，对这一提议表示有些怀疑与不能接受，他们认为在他们自己的经历中大多数的机器从未达到过名牌出力，况且现在机器更加残旧了，如何能保证它发挥全能呢？但实际事迹无情地击破了陈旧的保守思想。在苏联专家们亲临各地电厂具体帮助之下，各地电厂的主要设备经过了大检修以后，各种设备的出力都有了显著的提高，尤其是北京石景山和东北抚顺等电厂已经百分之百地达到了名牌出力。从全国范围来看，在实行了定期检修制度以后，预计一九五○年全国国营电业设备的平均可能出力可达百分之八十五，足以充沛地供应各地工业和民生的需要，使中国经济的恢复得以加速地进展。
    在生产制度中，由于苏联专家的建议与帮助，初步建立了先进的定额管理，负责制和经济核算等制度。因此，节省了很多的物资和人力，使电业生产成本逐步降低，并在个别地区减低了电价，供应了量多、质高和价廉的电力。
    苏联专家不仅对中国电力工业介绍了他们先进的技术标准，并且更根据中国的实际情况，建议我们进行了关于电厂管理组织的许多改革（如实行分场负责制等），使各地电厂都有步骤地摆脱了过去那种形式主义的官僚机构的桎梏，逐步地走向科学管理的途径。如石景山和抚顺等电厂在组织机构改善以后，工作效率已有了显著的提高。
    苏联专家到了各电厂后，首先了解实际情况，然后逐步地提出了改革的意见，并与各厂职工共同讨论，集体研究。例如关于检修石景山发电厂六号发电机时的平衡问题，因该厂和北京地区内的机械设备都不能解决这个问题，结果苏联专家提出了“电动测平衡法”的建议，并发动群众讨论，依靠了群众的智慧与努力而获得了解决。
    此外，无论在那个电厂，只要苏联专家足迹所到过的地方，他们都提出了几十条改善各种工作的具体建议。如在石景山、天津、唐山、太原、南京和淮南等电厂，苏联专家们的建议都在逐步实现中，并在实践中证明了这些建议都是最正确和最宝贵的。所以现在各电厂的职工们都从心坎里说：“苏联老大哥真能帮我们解决问题！”在大家和睦相处一年多的过程中，苏联专家和中国电业职工的感情是非常融洽的，而且还在继续不断地增进中。虽然彼此言语不通，但是热烈的握手和亲切的微笑，就传达了中苏两大民族间的深厚友情。
    苏联专家的工作态度是一丝不苟的，他们订了计划之后，立即严格执行。在他们的帮助下，我国国营电业已逐步建立了合理的劳动组织、劳动纪律和工作制度，使电业生产工作得以不断地进步，效率不断地提高。
    我们的工作人员因工程上的需要，经常轻易要求国家拨发外汇向国外订购器材，而且数字往往是非常庞大的。苏联专家看见这种情形，就用诚恳的态度对我们的技术人员说：“你们还是一个经济困难的国家，不要随便使资金外流。有些东西是可以设法在自己国内制造的。我们随时准备着贡献我们的技术来帮助你们制造器材。”我们接受了苏联专家的建议，因而减少了很多不必要的国外订货，节省了国家不少外汇的支出。苏联专家不是要我们多用宝贵的资金去向国外购买大批的新器材，而是尽力设法帮助我们把原有的机器效能提高，使它们像新机器一样地运转起来。
    在短短的一年多的过程中，苏联专家给予我们的帮助实在多得不胜枚举。仅就石景山发电厂一处来说，他们所提出的建议即达三百余件，据该厂今年七月份的统计，已经实行的约达百分之五十，其余各项建议在今年年底以前都可以陆续全部实行。
    苏联专家为了中国电业的前途，贡献了他们先进的科学技术知识和丰富的工作经验，指出了我国电业工作的方向，他们的劳动态度是我们最好的榜样。
    三、在石油工业方面
    中国的石油工业还是一株幼苗。我们在这个新兴的工业中要做的工作很多，我们需要一切先进技术的帮助也很迫切，去年，正当我们大力恢复工业生产的时候，具有伟大的国际主义精神和高度工作热情的苏联石油专家们，满怀着兄弟般的友情，应邀来到了我国，帮助我们早日完成伟大而艰巨的建设任务。
    苏联石油专家的足迹首先到达了甘肃玉门油矿。玉门位于中国的大西北，那里没有青草，没有树木，也没有清泉，是一片一望无边的大沙漠。但是那里却蕴藏着丰富的石油资源。苏联专家因为认识到玉门在中国石油工业上的重要地位，他们就不辞辛劳，不畏险阻地到了那里。
    苏联专家高度的工作热情是惊人的。在他们到达玉门以后，就和中国职工一样过着艰苦的生活。他们几乎没有休息地对玉门油矿的探勘、打钻、采油和炼油等各方面的工作都进行了深入的研究和分析。当他们回来以后，就非常热情地给我们提出了许多建议和批评。在钻井方面指出：由于我们缺乏计算和施工计划，因而无法正确计算钻井费用，并且无法考核工作进度。在采油方面，指出我们过去对于油矿的井下修理工作丝毫未曾做过，缺少井下修理队，因而未将一些暂时停闭的油井加以修复利用，现有油井的产油情况也未加以改良。针对着这些情况，苏联专家建议我们用向轴心直线行列开采法代替目前所用的渐密开采法。并在全部新探井打钻时，应钻取整个岩心及使用电气测岩心法。又建议我们在矿中迅速成立井下修理队，并召开石油地质专家会议，讨论关于加强地质探勘的工作，以确定钻探各个石油构造的先后缓急。这些事实说明了苏联石油专家对我们的诚挚的关怀。
    在新中国的第一次全国石油工业会议上，苏联专家始终不懈地参加了会议，在探勘、钻井、采炼方面给我们提出了许多意见。尤其在我们制订今后的钻探计划时，他们更给了我们重大而宝贵的帮助。苏联专家们认真地批判了我们不切合实际的笼统而庞大的钻探计划，而以他们的宝贵的丰富经验，结合着中国的人力、设备器材以及技术水平等各方面的实际情况，给我们提出了重点进行钻探工作的计划。同时也否定了过去国民党反动派统治时期遗留下来的季节性的钻井组织系统，指出季节性的钻井工作不能保证开发油田工作的正常进展，浪费了熟练的钻井干部，阻碍了他们有系统地提高技术，并使新的钻井干部也不易培养出来，使钻井工作不能达到必要的进步和增长。而更重要的，是他们的社会主义者的伟大的工作精神给予我们思想上的重大影响。当他们谈到我们冬季不钻井和某些技术人员认为在冬季钻井有困难或不经济时，他们就向我们介绍了苏联石油工业职工在冬季进行钻井工作的实际情况。他们说：“苏联石油工人在冬季温度达到摄氏零下五十度时和积雪厚达一公尺的地区，在那样困苦的环境和严寒的气候里，我们的钻井工作也是从来没有停止过的。”至于“冬季钻井不经济”的问题，苏联专家说：“只要我们的组织工作做得好，也能使冬季钻井的费用得到补偿的。”他们这种工作态度给我们某些具有保守思想和对工作缺乏积极性的技术人员一个很深刻的教训，同时也明确地指出了我们今后在钻探工作上所应走的道路。
    对于大西北石油资源的探勘工作是我们两三年内的工作重点之一，因而需要向国外订购钻机、钻杆、钻头以及其他的许多器材。苏联专家更在这方面给了我们很多具体的帮助。那些器材应该多订，那些器材应该少订，那些暂时可以不订，他们都慎重负责地给我们提出意见，以免我们浪费宝贵的外汇资金。同时更进一步地鼓励我们：“目前在中国制造钻井器材虽然不如向国外订购器材那样经济和省事。但你们也应尽力设法逐渐自制一些器材，因为这是你们应走的唯一正确的路。”这更充分表现出在列宁和斯大林教育下的优秀人民的作风是多么的崇高和伟大。只有他们才能真正将他们热爱自己祖国的心情同样奉献给他们的兄弟友邦。这是过去美帝派到中国来进行经济侵略活动的骗子和奸细所绝对不能比拟的！
    苏联专家对我们的帮助是表现在各方面的，有了他们的帮助，中国必然会迅速地走上工业化的道路。今天，在美帝国主义正疯狂地进行侵略战争的时候，我们的强大的国防军和强大的经济力量，有了苏联专家的帮助必定更加强大起来。让帝国主义侵略者在中苏两国人民的面前发抖罢！
