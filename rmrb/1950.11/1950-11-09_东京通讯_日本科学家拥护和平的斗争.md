Tokyo Dispatch
Japanese Scientists' Struggle to Uphold Peace
Masao Sasaki

    In the past year, the U.S. imperialists and their lackeys, the reactionary Japanese government, have increasingly exposed their aggressive war conspiracies and further intensified the militarization of Japan. The issues of the peace treaty with Japan and world peace have become matters of life and death for the Japanese people today.

    Japanese scientists, both in the past and present, have lived in extreme hardship. Even a professor at a public university earns only 10,000 yen, or slightly more, per month. The income of young researchers is even more pitiful, only about 7,000 yen per month. The research funding provided by the Ministry of Education, at most, amounts to only 20,000 to 30,000 yen per person per year, and most people receive only about 10,000 yen. Currently, the cheapest apartment in Japan cannot be rented for a full twenty days with 10,000 yen. Japanese scientists have personally experienced that their lives are so difficult, and research funding is so meager, leading to various difficulties in research, and that the reason for this is that more than half of Japan's budget is used to prepare for war. At the same time, they understand that lowering the level of science is tantamount to intensifying the thoroughness of Japan's colonization. They feel immense impatience and disgust with the restriction of only being able to see American magazines. Precisely because they are scientists, they know that using atomic bombs and conducting germ warfare are the most brutal criminal acts. Therefore, facing the current situation where Japanese science is gradually being directed towards military purposes, scientists feel the urgent need for peace more keenly.

    MacArthur's headquarters has not only plundered the military science of Japan's war of aggression, but also compiled a list of Japanese scientists for conscription at any time. Not only that, but they have also completely controlled the Geographical Survey Institute, Meteorological Observatory, Astronomical Observatory, and all observation posts and research institutes that previously belonged to the Japanese Army General Staff and can be directly used for military purposes. The Geographical Survey Institute has become a military map-making office for the U.S. military, and the geographers working there have been ordered to participate in mapping military bases in the Ryukyu Islands. There are countless examples of how some Japanese scientists are being used for military purposes.

    The vast majority of Japanese scientists yearn for peace and unanimously demand the prohibition of atomic bombs. At the same time, they oppose the militarization of Japan and hope to conclude a comprehensive peace treaty with the participation of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China. The fervent calls for striving for peace, demanding the prohibition of atomic bombs, opposing militarization, and demanding comprehensive peace talks erupted during the national scientists' conferences held in April this year.

    On April 3rd this year, a physics conference was held in Tokyo. During the same period, a discussion meeting on the study of "group elementary particle theory," one of the physics conferences that has always been watched by the worldwide scientific community, was also held. At this discussion meeting, Professor Watanabe Satoshi of Rikkyo University and Professor Fushimi Koji of Osaka University, among others, put forward peace statements full of opposition to militarization, demanding comprehensive peace talks, and banning atomic bombs, and proposed a motion to issue a "peace appeal" to American physicists. This motion was immediately met with enthusiastic support. Subsequently, ninety famous physicists, including Professor Sakata Shoichi of Nagoya University, Professor Miyazima Tatsugo of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Professors Inoue Ken and Kobayashi Minoru of Kyoto University, Professor Tanikawa Yasutaka of Kobe University, and member of the Academic Council Taketani Mitsuo, signed the peace appeal. They also issued an appeal to American physicists:

    "...We Japanese physicists deeply regret our failure to prevent the last war of aggression. However, we will certainly do our best to prevent the recurrence of future wars of aggression. We express our utmost respect for your efforts today to strive for peace, ban atomic bombs, and ban hydrogen bombs..."

    The day after this appeal was issued, the general assembly of the Geological Society of Japan also held a large conference. Hundreds of geologists from all over Japan rushed to attend this conference. At the conference, member of the Academic Council Taketani Mitsuo read out the peace statement issued by the physicists' discussion meeting. This statement received thunderous applause. Dr. Hayasaka Ichiro, a famous Japanese geologist and paleontologist, shook hands tightly with Taketani. After historian Fujima Ikio, representing the Democratic Scientists Association, read out a statement, Koichi Suzuki, head of the Tokyo branch of the Geological Society of Japan, immediately proposed a motion for "science for the defense of peace." This proposal was supported and approved by all attendees in thunderous applause, and immediately appealed to all academic organizations in Japan and peace-loving scientists around the world in the name of all members of the Geological Society of Japan:

    "...Many scientists have unanimously stated: if our research is used for war, we should abandon our research. However, in today's situation, the changes in the situation have made it impossible for us to maintain this position only on the surface. We, the colleagues engaged in geological work, as members of scientists, and as a group of scientists' organizations, would like to shout to scientists all over the world: 'Do not use science for war', 'We do not engage in scientific research for war'..."

    The above peace statements by Japanese physicists and geologists have fully demonstrated that a large number of Japanese scientists have actively expressed their attitude for peace. Because in the past, especially at the various academic conferences of natural sciences, they only discussed abstract academic matters. Scholars believed that as long as they worked hard on academic research, they had fulfilled their duty. However, since these two statements were published, scientists' views have changed by 180 degrees, recognizing that only lasting peace can allow them to focus on scientific research. Therefore, when various academic organizations subsequently convene general assemblies, they must issue such statements. By May of this year, seven academic organizations had issued similar statements.

    On April 18th, a unified core of the scientists' peace movement, the "Scientists' Peace Problem Discussion Meeting," was held in Tokyo. A total of 106 famous scientists attended this discussion meeting. They jointly issued a statement, pointing out that the fact that atomic energy science was first used for war is the greatest shame for scientists. At the same time, they protested against the reactionary Japanese government's shameful actions in suppressing the peace movement of the Japanese people, and strongly opposed the militarization of Japan and separate peace talks.

    The Democratic Scientists Association of Japan is a national organization engaged in the research and enlightenment movement of democratic science, with nearly 10,000 members. It also held its fifth congress in Tokyo on April 23rd. The congress stated that scientists absolutely cannot tolerate the imperialists' war attempts and demanded the prohibition of atomic bombs. All attendees approved and supported the world's peace forces united under the World Peace Defense Committee. The congress unanimously passed the "Peace Appeal" to move towards the peace movement.

    In the climax of the peace movement of Japanese scientists' associations and various academic organizations, the "Japan Science Council," a supreme representative conference of scientists organized by scientists elected by various academic societies and a consultation body of the Japanese government, unanimously passed a statement at its sixth general meeting: "Absolutely not to engage in scientific research for war." This statement has attracted attention from all sides.

    These statements are the beginning of the first step of Japanese scientists' extensive peace movement, and this firm determination to defend peace has been warmly welcomed by peace-loving people at home and abroad, and at the same time frightened the war-mongers entrenched in Japan.

    The struggle of Japanese scientists for peace has entered a new stage. Because they have reached the point where they should put their statements into practice. On May 15th, when Iles (note: Iles is an advisor to the Civil Information and Education Bureau of MacArthur's headquarters. According to MacArthur's will, he has toured various parts of Japan to give anti-communist lectures, and has been spurned by the vast majority of Japanese people and scholars - editor) appeared at Hokkaido University, the professors and researchers of the university worked together with the students to fight against this American fascist war-monger. The Student Self-Government Association, the Staff Union (labor union), and the Democratic Scientists Association immediately jointly established the "Iles Countermeasures Implementation Committee". Mathematician Moriya Mikeo and physicist Miyahara Shohei made inquiries to Iles in front of two thousand audiences on May 15th, which was the roar of the peace-loving scientists' indignation toward fascism. MacArthur's headquarters resented this and retaliated in the most despicable way. Matsuura, an authority in cytology, was invited to serve as the vice chairman of the World Democratic Education Society, but was ultimately banned from leaving the country.

    Japanese scientists enthusiastically responded to the Stockholm Peace Declaration. The "Staff Union" established by various researchers, the "Democratic Scientists Association," and various university research institutes have established "Peace Defense Associations" and "Supporters of Peace Groups" to strive to promote the peace signature movement. Several researchers in one research institute, in addition to the signature papers printed by the Democratic Scientists Association, also printed a large number of beautiful and unique signature papers. After motivating their colleagues to sign at their workplace, they also motivated their neighbors to participate in the signature. Moreover, they carried it with them when they traveled, and launched the signature movement in trains and travel destinations whenever there was an opportunity. At the same time, they mobilized those who participated in the signature to participate in the peace signature movement, and further expanded the signature movement. Up to now, the number of people each of them has mobilized to participate in the signature has reached as many as 500.

    As of the end of August, famous scientists who have signed the peace appeal include: member of the Japan Academy and inventor of KS magnetic steel Honda Kotaro, Nobel Prize winner and atomic physicist Yukawa Hideki, member of the Academy and former president of Seoul University and discoverer of Shigella dysenteriae Shiga Kiyoshi, president of Gakushuin University Abe Yoshishige, member of the Academy, honorary professor of Tokyo University, and authority on Japanese literature Fujimura Saku, honorary professor of Tohoku University and philosopher Abe Jiro, former president of Tokyo University of Commerce Fukui Koji, president of Osaka City University Sudo Kyo, member of the Academy, member of the Academic Council and economist Ouchi Hyoe, and others.

    Since the beginning of June, especially since the outbreak of the US imperialist war of aggression against Korea, the imperialists believe that the peace signature movement is the biggest obstacle to their war of aggression, and therefore began to carry out frantic oppression against the Communist Party of Japan and the peace-loving and democratic Japanese people. Many peace-loving people were arrested and falsely accused of "violating the policy of the occupation forces" simply for distributing leaflets "opposing war." All peace gatherings and democratic gatherings were stopped by the Japanese armed police and the occupation forces. However, Japanese scientists have expressed their determination to fight to the end for peace. The war-mongers of U.S. imperialism have ordered various natural science societies to organize military science advisory groups as preparation for conscripting all Japanese scientists to participate in the war of aggression. This order was issued by the Eighth Army of the U.S. stationed in Japan. Obviously, this is an insult to the will of Japanese scientists to resolutely support peace. First, the Japanese Physical Society rejected this order, and then the Japanese Geological Society also rejected it. This struggle of disobedience is spreading to various academic societies. Japanese scientists have stood up and launched a heated struggle for lasting peace. (Sent on September 10) (Translated by Kang Dachuan)

    日本科学家拥护和平的斗争
    佐佐木政雄
    这一年来，美帝国主义和它的走狗日本反动政府的侵略战争阴谋日益露骨化，并进一步加紧了日本的军事基地化工作。对日和约问题和世界的和平问题已成了今天日本人民生死攸关的问题。
    日本的科学家们，过去和现在都过着极端困苦的生活。即使是一个公立大学的教授，每月的薪水收入也只有一万日元，或多一点而已。至于年轻的研究家的收入则更少得可怜，每月只能拿到七千元左右。从文部省支出的研究费，最多的，每人每年也只能得到二万至三万日元，而大多数的人则只能得到一万日元左右的数目。目前，日本最贱的公寓，一万日元还无法住满二十天。日本的科学家们已亲身体验到，他们的生活如此困苦，研究费如此菲薄，致使研究上发生种种困难，而其原因则是日本预算的一大半以上被用于准备战争，同时他们更了解到，降低科学的水准，无异等于加紧日本殖民地化的彻底性。他们对于仅能看到美国杂志这一种限制，更感到莫大的不耐烦和厌恶。正因为是科学家，他们更知道使用原子弹和进行细菌战是一种最凶蛮的犯罪行为。因此，面临着日本的科学逐渐被导入于军事用途的现状之下，科学家们更切身感到和平的迫切需要。
    麦克阿瑟司令部，非但已经劫取了日本侵略战争时代的军事科学，同时并已列了一张日本科学家的名单，以便随时征用。非但如此，他们并已完全控制了过去属于日本陆军参谋本部的地理调查所、气象台、天文台及一切可直接运用于军事方面的观测所和研究所。地理调查所已变成了美军的军事地图测绘所，在这里工作的地理学者已被命参加测绘琉球军事基地的工作。像这种一部分日本科学家被利用于军事方面的实例已多至不胜枚举。
    绝大多数的日本科学家渴望着和平，一致要求禁止使用原子弹。同时并反对日本的军事基地化，希望缔结有苏联和中华人民共和国参加的全面和约。争取和平，要求禁用原子弹，反对军事基地化，要求全面媾和的热烈呼声已于今年四月间全国科学家召开各种学会时爆发了。
    今年四月三日，在东京召开了一个物理学会。在同一个时期，也召开了一向为全世界科学界注视的物理学会之一的研究“团体的素粒子论”恳谈会。在这个恳谈会上，立教大学教授渡边慧和大阪大学教授伏见康治等提出了充满着反对军事基地化、要求全面媾和、禁用原子弹的和平声明，并提出了对美国物理学家发出“和平呼吁”的动议。这个动议一提出，立刻获得了热烈的赞同。继而有名古屋大学教授坂田昌一、文理科大学教授宫?龙兴、京都大学教授井上健、小林稔、神户大学教授谷川安孝、学术会议会员武谷三男等九十名著名物理学家参加和平签名。他们并发表致美国物理学家的呼吁：
    “……我们日本物理学家对于未能防止上次的侵略战争深以为憾。然而，我们一定尽我们的最大努力，制止将来侵略战争的再发生。我们对于你们今天所作的，对于争取和平禁用原子弹和禁用氢气弹的努力，表示十二万分的敬意……”
    发表这个呼吁的第二天，日本地质学会总会也召开了一个大会。从全日本各地赶来参加这个大会的地质学家达数百名之多。在大会上面，学术会议会员武谷三男宣读了物理学家恳谈会所发表的和平声明。这一声明获得了如雷般的掌声。日本名地质学家、古生物学家早坂一郎博士紧紧地握住了武谷的手。继历史学家藤间生大代表民主科学家协会宣读声明书之后，日本地质学会东京支部长铃木好一立即提出了“保卫和平的科学”的议案。这个提案在如雷般的掌声中获得全体出席人员的拥护和赞成，并立刻以日本地质学会全体会员的名义，向全日本的各学术团体和全世界爱好和平的科学家发出呼吁：
    “……很多科学家都异口同声地表示：如果我们的研究被使用于战争，我们应该放弃我们的研究。然而在今天，情势的变化已使我们对这种立场不能仅在表面上坚持下去了。我们从事于地质学工作的同人，作为科学家的一分子，和作为一个科学家组织的团体，愿向全世界的科学家高呼：‘不要为战争而使用科学’，‘我们不为战争从事于科学的研究’……。”
    上述日本物理学家和地质学家的和平声明，已充分证明，广大的日本科学家已为和平而积极地表示了态度。因为在过去，特别是自然科学的各种学会每次开会都只讨论抽象的学问上的事宜。学者们都认为：只要努力于学术上的研究，便已尽到自己的天职。然而，自从这两个声明发表以后，科学家们的看法已有了一百八十度的改变，认识到只有持久和平，才能使他们安心于科学的研究。因此，嗣后各种学术团体召开总会时，定必发表这样的声明，至今年五月间为止，已有七个学术团体发表同样的声明。
    四月十八日，在东京召开了科学家和平运动的统一核心的“科学家和平问题恳谈会”。共有一○六名著名科学家出席这一次的恳谈会。他们共同发出声明，指出原子能科学竟被最先用于战争是科学家的最大耻辱。同时，他们并抗议日本反动政府弹压日本人民和平运动的可耻举动，强烈反对日本的军事基地化和单独媾和。
    日本民主主义科学家协会是一个从事于民主主义科学的研究和启蒙运动的全国性组织，拥有将近一万名的会员，也于四月二十三日在东京召开第五届大会。大会声明：科学家绝对不能容忍帝国主义的战争企图，要求禁用原子弹。出席人员全体赞成和拥护团结在世界保卫和平委员会之下的全世界的和平势力。大会一致通过向和平运动迈进的“和平呼吁”。
    在日本科学家学会和各种学术团体的和平运动的高潮中，由各学会以选举方法选出的科学家组织的科学家最高代表会议，又是日本政府的谘询机关的“日本学术会议”，在其第六届总会中全体通过：“绝对不为战争而从事于科学研究”的声明，这一声明已引起了各方面的重视。
    这些声明是日本科学家们展开广泛的和平运动的第一步的开始，而这种保卫和平的坚强决心，已得到国内外爱好和平的人民的热烈欢迎，同时并吓坏了盘踞在日本的战争贩子们。
    日本科学家争取和平的斗争已进入了新的阶段。因为他们已达到了应该把自己所作的声明付诸实施的时候了。五月十五日，当伊尔斯（按伊尔斯为麦克阿瑟总部民间情报教育局的顾问，秉承麦克阿瑟的意志，曾到日本各地作反共巡回讲演，受到日本广大人民与学者的唾弃。——编者）出现在北海道大学时，该大学的教授及研究者们与学生们同心协力，打击了这个美国的法西斯战争贩子。学生自治会、职员组合（工会）和民主主义科学家协会，立刻共同成立了“伊尔斯对策实行委员会”。数学家守屋美贺雄、物理学家宫原将平两教授，曾于五月十五日，向二千名的听众，对伊尔斯提出质问，这是爱好和平的科学家对法西斯的激怒的吼声。麦克阿瑟司令部对此记恨在心，于是以最卑鄙的方法作了报复。松浦是一位细胞学的权威，他已被邀充当世界民主教育学会的副主席，然而，结果被禁止出国。
    日本的科学家们热烈响应了斯德哥尔摩和平宣言。由各种研究者成立的“职员工会”、“民主主义科学家协会”、和各大学研究所均纷纷成立“保卫和平会”与“拥护和平者小组”，努力宣传和平签名运动。有一个研究所的几位研究员，除掉民主主义科学家协会印发的签名纸外，自己又印了大批美观别致的签名纸，发动自己工作地点的同事们签名之后，又发动了邻居们参加签名。而且，在其旅行时并随身携带，在火车中和旅行目的地，一有机会便随时展开签名运动。同时并发动了参加签名的人参加和平签名运动，把签名运动进一步展开。截至目前为止，他们每人所发动参加签名的人数将达五○○名之多。
    至八月底为止，参加和平签名的著名科学家计有：日本学士院会员、ＫＳ磁性钢发明者本多光太郎，诺贝尔奖金得奖者、原子物理学家汤川秀树，学士院会员、原汉城大学校长、赤痢菌发见人志贺洁，学习院大学校长安部能成，学士院会员、东京大学名誉教授、日本国文学权威藤村作，东北大学名誉教授、哲学家阿部次郎，前东京商科大学校长福井孝治，大阪市立大学校长须藤恭，学士院会员、学术会议会员经济学家大内兵卫等。
    自六月初旬起，尤其自美帝国主义侵略朝鲜战争发生以来，帝国主义者认为和平签名运动是他们侵略战争的最大障碍，因之开始对日本共产党和爱好和平与民主的日本人民作疯狂的压迫。不少爱好和平的人民，仅仅因散发“反对战争”的传单，即被诬指为“违犯占领军政策”而横遭逮捕，一切的和平集会和民主的集会皆遭到日本武装警察和占领军的制止。然而，日本的科学家却已表示坚决为争取和平而斗争到底的决心。美帝国主义的战争贩子们已命令各自然科学学会组织军事科学顾问团，作为征用所有的日本科学家参加侵略战争的准备。这道命令由美帝驻日的第八军所发出。很明显，这是对日本科学家们所坚决表示的拥护和平的意志的侮辱。首先，日本物理学会拒绝了这道命令，继之，日本地质学会也拒绝了。这种抗命的斗争正在蔓延至各学会。日本的科学家们，已挺身而起，为争取持久和平而展开热烈的斗争了。（九月十日寄）（康大川译）
