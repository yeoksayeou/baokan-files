Korean Lee Xuanhao Residing in Guisui
Writes a Letter to Chairman Mao to Express Respect and Gratitude for the Chinese People's Volunteers' Aid to Korea

[Our Newspaper] Korean Lee Xuanhao, residing in Guisui, Suiyuan Province, wrote a letter to Chairman Mao to express his respect and gratitude for the Chinese people's action in resisting America and aiding Korea. The original letter is as follows:

Respected Chairman Mao:

Allow me, as a Korean residing on the free land of China, to extend my highest respect to you. And to express my utmost gratitude to the great action of the Chinese People's Volunteers in resisting America and aiding Korea under your leadership.

We Korean people, among the Asian brotherly nations, are one of the most afflicted, living a life of slavery under the long-term trampling of Japanese imperialism. The history of the past fifty years is a history of blood and tears for the Korean people. We will never forget that the Korean and Chinese people joined hands to defeat the Japanese invaders. Nor will we forget that five years ago, the great Soviet Red Army forced the Japanese invaders to surrender, giving the Korean people their own country.

But the American imperialists, this mad beast, actually replaced the role of the Japanese invaders, and through the traitor Syngman Rhee, fantasized about continuing to enslave Korea, and brazenly launched a brutal invasion, plunging our newly reborn Korean people into the flames of war again. We Korean people clearly recognize that imperialists are all the same, and the disasters inflicted on the Korean people by the American executioners are even more brutal and unprecedented. The Korean people are fighting for their motherland, for democratic freedom and lasting peace. We are not isolated, as can be seen from the movement of the Chinese people to resist America and aid Korea. I saw in the newspaper the joint declaration of all democratic parties in China supporting the Chinese People's Volunteers' resistance to America and aid to Korea. This iron-like voice, in Suiyuan, has already seen practical action. Yesterday, I participated in the founding meeting of the Suiyuan Committee for Defending Peace and Opposing American Aggression. At the meeting, the declaration of resisting America and aiding Korea was passed, which made me burst into tears from the bottom of my heart.

Today I also saw a special edition of the newspaper, knowing that we had won a great victory in the northwest of our motherland, annihilating many enemies. This victory was obtained under the direct participation of the Chinese People's Volunteers in resisting America and aiding Korea. I believe that every Korean people, after receiving the assistance of the Chinese people, will inevitably have a hundred times more courage and fight to the end, until the American imperialist aggressors are finally buried on the land of the motherland.

I am willing, under your leadership and the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, to actively participate in the work of defending peace, to make up for my loss of not being able to return to the country to dedicate myself to the revolutionary cause of the motherland.

I wish you—Chairman Mao, the savior of the Asian people, good health!

Long live the victory of the Korean people's struggle against American aggression!

　　寄居归绥的朝鲜人李炫昊
    写信向毛主席致敬感谢中国人民志愿援朝
    【本报讯】在绥远省归绥寄居的朝鲜人李炫昊，写信给毛主席致敬，感谢中国人民抗美援朝的行动。原信如下：
    敬爱的毛主席：
    允许我以一个寄居在中国自由大地上的朝鲜人民，向您敬致崇高的敬礼。并向在您领导下的中国人民志愿展开的抗美援朝的伟大行动，表示万分感谢。
    我们朝鲜人民在亚洲兄弟民族当中，是遭受苦难最多的一个，长期的在日本帝国主义蹂躏下，过着奴隶的生活。近五十年的历史，是朝鲜人民血泪斗争的历史。我们永远忘不掉朝鲜人民和中国人民携手并肩击败日寇。更忘不掉五年以前，苏联伟大红军迫使日寇投降，使朝鲜人民有了自己的国家。
    但美帝国主义这个疯狂的野兽，居然代替了日寇的角色，通过卖国贼李承晚，幻想继续奴役朝鲜，悍然发动狂暴的侵略，让我们刚获得新生的朝鲜人民，又投入战争的火海中。我们朝鲜人民清楚地认识帝国主义都是一样的货色，而美国刽子手们加之于朝鲜人民的灾难，更是残暴无比，史无前例的。朝鲜人民为自己的祖国，为民主自由与持久和平而战，我们不是孤立的，这从中国人民所发动的抗美援朝运动来看就可证明。我从报上看到中国各民主党派联合宣言拥护中国人民志愿抗美援朝。这个钢铁般的声音，在绥远已看到实际行动。昨天我参加了绥远保卫和平反美侵略委员会的成立大会，会上通过抗美援朝宣言，使我由衷地掉下泪来。
    今天我又看到号外，知道在我们祖国西北部打了胜仗，歼灭的敌人很多。这个胜利是在中国人民抗美援朝志愿队直接参战下所获得的。我相信每一个朝鲜人民获得了中国人民的援助后必然勇气百倍，血战到底，一直到最后把美帝侵略者埋葬在祖国大地上。
    我愿在您和中国共产党领导下，积极参加保卫和平的工作，来弥补我不能回国献身祖国革命事业的损失。
    祝您——亚洲人民的救星毛主席健康！
    朝鲜人民抗美斗争胜利万岁！
    在绥远省归绥居留的朝鲜人民
    李炫昊一九五○年十一月八日
