Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, October 29th (TASS): Today's Izvestia published an essay by Yakolev entitled "Lie - A slavish lackey of American imperialists."

Yakolev, from the perspective of the United Nations Charter, analyzed in detail the role and tasks of the United Nations Secretary-General and came to the conclusion that the work undertaken by the United Nations Secretary-General requires him to have an objective attitude and impartiality. He must not succumb to any external influences. According to Article 100 of the United Nations Charter, the Secretary-General shall not be the representative of the will or wishes of any one country or several countries. To achieve this goal, it is naturally necessary to carefully nominate candidates for Secretary-General, so that the selected person can meet the requirements of the United Nations Charter in this regard.

Yakolev emphasized that Lie's five-year history of activities in the United Nations has proven that he is not worthy of the responsible position he holds. Lie has lost the trust of many United Nations member states, because in his activities, he does not have the demeanor of a statesman, nor the demeanor that a person holding a high position in an international organization such as the United Nations must have. The article went on to say that, in fact, Lie has become a docile tool of the American delegation, directly acting on the orders of his masters, which is completely inconsistent with his responsibilities as a United Nations Secretary-General. This has been proven once again by his entire behavior at the current session of the United Nations General Assembly. Yakolev then mentioned the remarks of certain reactionary American newspapers, which openly admitted that Lie is a slavish lackey of the U.S. State Department.

Yakolev cited various facts to prove that Lie only pays lip service to the cause of peace and to the observance of the United Nations Charter, but in reality, he tries every possible means to support the Anglo-American bloc's policy of undermining the cause of peace and undermining the United Nations. For example, everyone knows that the United Nations "Balkans" and "Korean" Commissions were established through the efforts of the Anglo-American bloc by misappropriating and undermining the United Nations Charter – these two committees earned Lie a reputation of notoriety. Lie not only did not stop the establishment of these two committees, but also sheltered them, as evidenced by his report on the United Nations' activities in 1948.

At the same time, everyone also knows that the so-called "Interim Committee" was also organized by the Anglo-American bloc by usurping and undermining the United Nations Charter. Lie not only did not protest against this notorious violation of the Charter, but instead applauded the establishment of this useless "institution," which has now encountered a shameful failure.

Lie's violation of the principles and tasks of the United Nations is also reflected in his support for the aggressive North Atlantic Treaty, which was concluded behind the United Nations' back, usurping the name of the United Nations and undermining the basic principles of the United Nations. On August 10, 1949, someone said: "Some people assert that I do not approve of this treaty (referring to the North Atlantic Treaty), but they are mistaken." It was Lie who said this. Lie's words in support of the North Atlantic Treaty and his actions in supporting the enslaving Marshall Plan clearly prove that he is a loyal singer for the Anglo-American war-mongers and a servant of American monopoly capitalists.

Yakolev pointed out that the facts listed here do not cover all the disreputable actions taken by Lie during his tenure as Secretary-General. Yakolev continued, every unbiased person is well aware that Lie cannot and absolutely must not remain in the position of Secretary-General. He betrayed the trust of those who authorized him to perform the duties of Secretary-General. However, on the other hand, Lie seems to have many enthusiastic American supporters, who are doing everything possible - including exerting crude pressure and intimidation on other delegations - to force the United Nations to accept this bankrupt political speculator.

In the course of the Fifth Session, several people were nominated as new candidates for Secretary-General: Rau (India), Navez (Mexico), Malik (Lebanon), Romulo (Philippines). No one on the Security Council raised any personal or other objections to these individuals. However, the American representative, disregarding the opposition of the Soviet Union and representatives of many other countries, distorted the United Nations Charter and attempted to bypass the Security Council and force United Nations member states to accept Lie's candidacy for a new term, according to American orders.

Yakolev said that after Austin rudely used all sorts of means to disregard the United Nations Charter and the rights of the Security Council, and threatened that the American delegation would use the "veto" to obstruct the passage of any other candidate, if Lie had even a minimum of self-respect, he himself should have abandoned his nomination long ago.

Yakolev wrote: It is clear that the American delegation greatly appreciates the various services that Lie has rendered to it during his tenure as Secretary-General of the United Nations. Therefore, the American delegation issued Lie a certificate: A loyal henchman of American imperialists, a docile servant of Wall Street. Yakolev wrote in conclusion: The position of Secretary-General of this organization, which is responsible for maintaining peace and security and strengthening international cooperation, must no longer be usurped by the servants of Wall Street.

The United Nations General Assembly must have a strong voice and resolutely reject Lie's clearly unsuitable candidacy, who has proven to be unworthy of the position of Secretary-General.

### 赖伊——美国帝国主义者的百依百顺的奴仆

　　赖伊——美国帝国主义者的百依百顺的奴仆
    ·雅科夫列夫·
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科二十九日电：今日消息报刊载雅科夫列夫的论文，题为《赖伊——美国帝国主义者的百依百顺的奴仆》。
    雅科夫列夫从联合国宪章的观点详细地分析了联合国秘书长的作用与任务后得出一个结论：联合国秘书长所担负的工作要求他要有客观的态度与公正无私的精神。他必须不屈从于任何外来的影响。根据联合国宪章第一百条，秘书长不能成为任何一国或数国的意志或愿望的代表者。要达到这种目的，自然必须深思熟虑地提名秘书长的候选人，以使这个人选能符合联合国宪章在这方面的要求。
    雅科夫列夫着重指出，赖伊在联合国活动的五年历史已经证明，他不配他所担负的这个责任重大的职务。赖伊已经失去了很多联合国会员国的信任，因为在他的活动中，他没有政治家的风度，没有作为在联合国这样的国际组织中担任高位的那种人所必须具有的风度。该文继称，事实上，赖伊已经变成了美国代表团的恭顺工具，直接照他的主子的吩咐办事，一点也不符合他作为一个联合国秘书长的职责。这一点，已再次由他在目前联合国大会会议上的全部行径所证明，雅科夫列夫随即提到美国某些反动报纸的言论，它们公开承认赖伊是美国国务院的百依百顺的奴仆。
    雅科夫列夫引据各种事实，证明赖伊对和平事业、对遵守联合国宪章只是卖一下嘴，而实际上却是千方百计地支持美英集团破坏和平事业、破坏联合国的政策。举例来说，大家都知道：联合国“巴尔干”与“朝鲜”委员会便是通过英美集团的努力在盗用与破坏联合国宪章的情形下建立起来的，——这两个委员会给赖伊挣来的报酬是声名狼籍。赖伊不但不制止这两个委员会的成立，反而加以庇护，他的关于联合国一九四八年的活动的报告就是这样。
    同时，大家也知道：所谓“临时委员会”也是英美集团篡夺与破坏了联合国宪章而组织的。赖伊不但不抗议这种臭名昭彰的侵犯宪章的事情，却反而对这个毫无用处的“机构”的建立大加喝彩，现在这个“机构”业已遭遇到可耻的失败。
    赖伊违背联合国的原则与任务的事情，还表现在他支持侵略性的北大西洋公约上，该项公约乃是在联合国背后盗用联合国名义与破坏联合国的基本原则的情况下缔结的。一九四九年八月十日有人说：“有些人断定说，我不赞成这个公约（指北大西洋公约），然而，他们搞错了。”说这种话的正是赖伊，赖伊这种拥护北大西洋公约的话以及他支持奴役别人的马歇尔计划的举动都清楚地证明了他是美英战争贩子的忠实歌手与美国独占资本家的仆从。
    雅科夫列夫指出，这里所列举的事实并没有把赖伊在秘书长任内所作的一切不名誉的行动讲完。雅科夫列夫继续说，每一个无偏见的人都很清楚：赖伊不能而且绝对不能再留在秘书长的职位上了。他出卖了那些授权他执行秘书长职责的人们的信任。不过，在另一方面，赖伊却好像拥有很多热心的美国拥护者，他们竭尽种种办法——包括对别的代表团加以粗暴的压力与恫吓——以图强使联合国接受这个已经破产了的政治投机家。
    在第五届会议的过程中，有好几个人被提名为新的秘书长候选人：劳氏（印度）、纳孚（墨西哥）、麦里克（黎巴嫩）、罗慕洛（菲律宾），对于这几个人在安理会上并没有人提出任何对他们个人的或其他的反对意见。可是，美国代表不顾苏联与许多其他国家的代表的反对，竟歪曲联合国宪章，企图按照美国的命令而越过安理会，强制联合国会员国接受赖伊新任期的候选资格。
    雅科夫列夫说：在奥斯汀无礼地使用各式各样的手段不顾联合国宪章与安全理事会的权利，并扬言美国代表团要使用“否决权”，从而阻碍了任何其他候补人的通过以后，假如赖伊还有一点点起码的自尊心的话，那么他本人早该放弃他的提名了。
    雅科夫列夫写道：很明显，美国代表团对赖伊在联合国秘书长任内所给予它的种种效劳是甚为赏识的。因此，美国代表团发给赖伊一张奖状：美国帝国主义者的忠驯帮凶、华尔街的恭顺奴仆。雅科夫列夫在结语中写道：这个负有维护和平与安全及加强国际合作之责的组织的秘书长职位再不容被华尔街的奴仆们所篡窃了。
    联合国大会必须有有力的发言权，坚决拒绝已证明不称秘书长之职的赖伊显然不适合的候选资格。
