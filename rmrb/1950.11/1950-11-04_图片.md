American imperialism is burning the flames of its war of aggression against Korea to the border of our Northeast. This is part of the overall strategic plan of the United States for direct aggression against China. The US High Command, in their operational plans, wants to use Korean territory and the Korean puppet army to fight in our Northeast and other places, use Vietnam, Burma, and Hong Kong as bases to attack South China, and use Taiwan as a base to transport paratroopers to invade East China, Central China, and other places. Our people throughout the country must be highly vigilant against this huge military conspiracy of American imperialism.

    美帝国主义正把侵朝战争的火焰烧向我国东北边境。这是美国直接侵略中国的整个战略计划的一部分。美国高级指挥部在他们的作战计划中想要利用朝鲜领土和朝鲜伪军在我国东北等地作战，利用越南、缅甸、香港为基地进攻华南，利用台湾为基地运送伞兵侵入华东、华中等地。我们全国人民对于美帝国主义这个巨大的军事阴谋要有高度的警惕。
