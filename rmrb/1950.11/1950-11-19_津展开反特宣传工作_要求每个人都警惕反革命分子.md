Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 16th -- Tianjin has widely launched an anti-espionage propaganda campaign to raise the vigilance of the citizens. Since late August, various districts throughout the city have universally convened small-scale discussion meetings to deeply publicize the people's government's policy of eliminating spies. In addition to strengthening anti-espionage propaganda, various organs and enterprises have also conducted inspections of confidentiality and security work. Communist Party organizations and people's organizations such as trade unions in various districts have conducted propaganda to citizens through Party members and members. Newspapers, radio stations, and theaters have also cooperated to carry out various propaganda efforts. People's cultural centers in various districts have used large-character posters, cartoons, and other different methods to carry out street propaganda, and six cultural centers have held anti-espionage photo exhibitions. The New Life Troupe of the Tianjin Public Security Bureau performed the new Peking opera "Public Enemy," which was themed on the anti-espionage struggle, and the audience reached more than 50,000 people. In addition, the Military Law Department of the Tianjin Military Control Commission held two public trials of spies, and absorbed 600 representatives from all walks of life to participate in the hearing.

After extensive and in-depth propaganda work, the general public has a further understanding of the people's government's anti-espionage policy, and clearly realizes that the sabotage activities of counter-revolutionary elements are directly against the people; fighting against spies is not only a matter for the people's government, but everyone has the responsibility to report them. During the propaganda period, many citizens wrote to the public security organs to report counter-revolutionary elements. In September alone, the four public security sub-bureaus received 43 letters from citizens reporting them. The Liutan police station of the Third Public Security Sub-bureau, through citizen reports and discoveries in propaganda work, found a total of 202 unregistered spies and reactionary party members. At the three rounds of workers' symposiums held by the police station, workers reported a fugitive who was wanted in Tianjin that day. At the same time, due to the in-depth propaganda work, the vigilance of the citizens has increased day by day, making many lurking reactionary elements feel fear, and have to register and surrender to the people's government. According to the statistics of the Eleventh Public Security Sub-bureau in September alone, 34 spies and reactionary party members registered and surrendered to the bureau, and handed over documents, weapons, radios, etc.

　　津展开反特宣传工作
    要求每个人都警惕反革命分子
    【新华社天津十六日电】天津市已广泛展开反对特务的宣传工作，以提高市民群众的警惕性。自八月下旬以来，全市各区已普遍召开了各种小型座谈会，深入宣传人民政府肃清特务的政策。各机关、企业部门除加强反特的宣传外，并结合检查了保密和保安工作。各区中共组织及工会等人民团体，都通过党员、会员向市民进行宣传。各报社、广播电台及影剧院，也配合进行了各种宣传工作。各区人民文化馆利用大字报、漫画等各种不同的方式，进行了街头宣传，并有六个文化馆举办了反特图片展览会。该市公安局新生大队文工团演出了以反特斗争为主题的“人民公敌”新京剧，观众达五万余人。此外，天津市军管会军法处并举行了两次特务公审，吸收各界代表六百余人参加旁听。
    经过广泛和深入地进行宣传工作后，一般市民对人民政府的肃特政策有了进一步的了解，清楚地认识到：反革命分子的破坏活动，是直接和人民为敌的；与特务作斗争不仅是人民政府的事情，而且每个人都有检举的责任。在宣传期间，很多市民向公安机关写信检举了反革命分子。在九月份，仅四个公安分局即收到市民检举信四十三件。公安第三分局经市民检举及在宣传工作中发现的未登记的特务、反动党团分子等共达二百零二人。在该局柳滩派出所召开的三轮工人座谈会上，工人检举了当日来津通缉在案的逃犯。同时，由于宣传工作的深入，市民警惕性日益提高，使许多潜伏的反动分子感到恐惧，而不得不向人民政府登记自首。仅公安第十一分局九月份的统计，即有三十四个特务及反动党团分子向该局登记自首，并交出文件、武器、电台等。
