Xinhua News Agency, 10th. An article by Fang Weizhong published in the Northeast Daily on November 4 analyzed the essence of the U.S. imperialist war of aggression plan. After discussing that the current international situation is that U.S. imperialism is attempting to provoke a third world war and has entered the stage of open military aggression from war preparation, the author pointed out: The main purpose of U.S. imperialism in launching wars of aggression is to try to save its dying fate through war and realize its ambition to dominate the world. The U.S. economy is facing a serious crisis after the war, which is the basic factor determining all its policies.

　　During World War II, American capitalists seized a staggering high profit of $53 billion and expanded their industrial production capacity. After the end of the war, due to the shrinking of domestic and foreign markets, this artificial "prosperity" of American industry quickly came to an end. Since the autumn of 1948, production has been declining steadily. By July 1949, production had fallen to only 65 percent of the wartime peak.

　　The number of unemployed people also increased rapidly with the decline in production. In 1949, the number of bankrupt companies was about twice as many as in 1948. If we include those who went out of business without going bankrupt, a total of more than 480,000 companies closed down last year.

　　American monopoly capitalists used the "Marshall Plan" in an attempt to transfer the domestic economic crisis to other countries, and at the same time expanded their military power to obtain orders for the company.

　　In order to delay the increasingly serious economic crisis, U.S. imperialism frantically incites and prepares for world war, pushing the national economy towards a wartime system. Finding a way out of the war is the basic reason why U.S. imperialism has been pursuing a cold war policy, and then actively preparing for war and even openly engaging in military aggression.

　　In the years after the war, the U.S. government continued to use a large amount of taxpayers' money to transport it to capitalists. From 1946 to 1949, the average annual expenditure reached more than 43 billion U.S. dollars, which was five times higher than in pre-war years.

　　This policy enabled capitalists to obtain huge profits.

　　The following is the increase in profits of American companies during the so-called Cold War period from 1946 to 1949 (unit after tax: 100 million U.S. dollars)
                  1946, 139
                  1947, 190
                  1948, 212
                  1949, 170

　　The five largest monopoly enterprises in the United States have obtained particularly huge profits in the "Cold War" era. The total after-tax profits of the five major companies, New Jersey Mobil Oil Company, General Motors Company, United States Steel Company, DuPont Company, and General Electric Company, totaled more than 4 billion U.S. dollars from 1946 to 1949 after the war, which was about 14 percent larger than during World War II.

　　During the period of active war preparation before the Korean War, the profits of monopoly capitalists took another big leap. The net profits of the four monopoly enterprises, General Motors Corporation, U.S. Steel Corporation, DuPont Corporation, and General Electric Corporation, in the second quarter of 1950 increased by 58.1% to 115.7% compared with the same quarter of 1949 in one year.

　　Boeing Aircraft Company, which produces the Flying Fortresses now used to bomb the Korean people, made almost nine times more profit in the first half of 1950 than in the same period in 1949.

　　War is a great disaster for peaceful people, but it is a way for monopoly capitalists to make a fortune. After the outbreak of the Korean War, the big capitalists in the United States seemed particularly active and enthusiastic.

　　The day after Truman submitted a war expansion message to Congress regarding the Korean War, the National Association of Manufacturers—the real backstage boss of the American government, the monopoly capitalist group—issued a telegram, fully agreeing with Truman's proposed aggression plan and promising to fully support its realization. At the same time, on the New York stock market, the stocks of all companies related to war production immediately soared. Representatives of various industrial companies immediately gathered in Washington to compete for a large pile of government war order forms. In the two and a half months after the outbreak of the Korean War alone, the amount of so-called "defense" orders received by companies from the government had reached more than 7 billion U.S. dollars. Kaiser, the largest shipbuilding and aluminum company in the United States associated with the war, has been ordered to double its aluminum production. The largest aircraft manufacturer in the United States, Fotty Aircraft Company, is now adding an extra shift every day and extending the working hours of each shift by two hours.

　　As the demand for materials increased sharply due to the war, capitalist monopoly enterprises took the opportunity to greatly increase prices. DuPont's rayon and Mobil Oil's gasoline immediately increased in price, and the prices of daily consumer goods such as butter, coffee, and bread also increased greatly.

　　This is the essence of why U.S. imperialists desperately launch wars. Nourishing one's own beastly behavior by slaughtering the blood of millions of people is the true face of the "ideas of free mankind" and "maintaining world peace" chanted by U.S. imperialists.

　　Imperialism is afraid of peace. The infamous Truman's "advisor" Baruch once told New York students frankly: In the barbaric time of war, peace seems remarkable; once the war stops, peace becomes hateful. Eisenhower once said violently: "Rather than obtaining a peace that will inevitably destroy the ideas and ideals of free mankind (this should be the free ideal of Wall Street monopoly capitalists to enslave the world), it is better to risk a war and face possible destruction."

　　Imperialists know that time is not on their side, so they frantically and hurriedly plan various groups and alliances of reactionary forces to realize their aggression plans.

　　However, the desperate launching of wars of aggression by imperialists does not indicate the strength of imperialism, but rather indicates the decay and dying struggle of imperialism. Historical lessons teach us that the more hopeless the situation of imperialist reactionaries is, the more rampant and dangerous they become.

　　Chairman Mao instructed us wisely almost three years ago: "The crisis is like a volcano, threatening American imperialism every day. American imperialism is sitting on this volcano. This situation has forced American imperialist elements to establish a plan to enslave the world, like beasts, scurrying around in Europe, Asia, and other places, gathering reactionary forces from various countries, those dregs abandoned by the people, forming an imperialist and anti-democratic camp, opposing all democratic forces headed by the Soviet Union, preparing for war, and attempting to launch a third world war one day in the future, in the distant future, to defeat the democratic forces."

　　However, what war will bring to imperialism is not "revival" and "prosperity"; but its demise! On this road, there has already been the demise of Italian fascism, the demise of German fascism, and the demise of Japanese imperialism!

　　美帝国主义为什么要发动侵略战争？
    其主要目的是企图借战争来挽救其垂死的命运，并实现其统治世界的野心。
    【新华社十日讯】十一月四日东北日报刊载房维中一文，分析美帝国主义侵略战争计划的实质。作者在论述目前国际形势是美帝国主义正企图挑起第三次世界大战，并已由准备战争进入到公开的军事侵略阶段之后指出：美帝国主义发动侵略战争，其主要目的是企图借战争来挽救其垂死的命运，并实现其统治世界的野心。战后美国经济面临严重危机，这是决定其一切政策的基本因素。
    在第二次世界大战中，美国的资本家攫取了达五百三十亿美元的惊人的高额利润，扩张了工业生产能力。战争结束以后，由于国内外市场的缩小，美国工业这种人工的“繁荣”，很快的完结了。自一九四八年秋季开始，生产即节节下降，到一九四九年七月，生产跌到只达战时最高峰的百分之六十五。
    失业人数也随着生产的下降迅速的增加。一九四九年，破产倒闭企业较一九四八年约多一倍。若把未破产就停业的算在内，则去年一年，关门的企业共达四十八万家以上。
    美国垄断资本家利用“马歇尔计划”，企图把国内的经济危机转嫁到别的国家头上，同时经过扩充军备，来为公司取得定货。
    为了延缓日益加剧的经济危机，美帝国主义疯狂地鼓动和准备世界战争，把国家经济推向战时体制。从战争中找出路，这就是美帝国主义所一直进行冷战政策，并进而积极准备战争以至公开军事侵略的基本原因。
    美国政府在战后几年中，继续以大量纳税人的钱输送给资本家。自一九四六年到一九四九年，平均每年开支达四三○亿美元以上，高于战前年份的五倍。
    这种政策使资本家们获取了巨大利润。
    下面就是从一九四六年到一九四九年所谓冷战政策时期美国公司利润的增涨情况（纳税后单位：亿美元）
                  一九四六年，一三九
                  一九四七年，一九○
                  一九四八年，二一二
                  一九四九年，一七○
    美国五大独占企业在“冷战”的年代中获取了特别巨大的利润。新泽西美孚油公司，通用汽车公司，美国钢铁公司，杜邦公司，通用电气公司五大公司战后一九四六至一九四九年总利润在纳税后高达四十亿美元以上，比第二次大战期间还要大差不多百分之十四。
    在朝鲜战争以前的积极备战时期，垄断资本家的利润又大大地跃进了一步。通用汽车公司、美国钢铁公司、杜邦公司、通用电气公司四个独占企业，一九五○年第二季纯利润与一九四九年同季比较，一年中间就增加百分之五十八点一到百分之一百一十五点七。
    生产着现在用以轰炸朝鲜人民的飞行堡垒的波音飞机公司，一九五○年上半年的利润比一九四九年同时期几乎增加九倍。
    战争，对于和平人民是莫大灾难，对于垄断资本家们却是发财之道。朝鲜战争发动以后，美国大资本家显得特别活跃和热心。
    在杜鲁门就朝鲜的战事向国会递出扩大战争咨文的第二天，全国制造商协会——美国政府真正后台老板垄断资本家团体——就发出通电，完全同意杜鲁门所建议的侵略计划，并允以全力支持其实现。在这同时，纽约股票市场上，所有与战争生产有关的公司股票立即飞涨。各种工业公司的代表们，立即群集华盛顿，争相分取政府的一大堆战争定货单。单单在朝鲜战争发生后二个半月中间，公司收到政府的所谓“国防”定货数额就已达七十多亿美元。与战争有关的美国最大造船及铝业公司凯塞公司已奉命将铝的生产增加一倍。美国最大飞机制造公司之——佛梯飞机公司，现在每天加开一班工作，并且每班延长工作时间两小时。
    随着物资需要量由于战争而骤增，资本家各垄断企业乘机大大提高价格，杜邦公司的人造丝、美孚油公司的汽油即刻加价，日常消费品如牛油、咖啡、面包的价格也大大增加。
    这就是美帝国主义者为什么拼命发动战争的实质。借屠杀千百万人民的鲜血，来滋养自己的野兽行为，这就是美帝国主义者所高唱的“自由人类的思想”、“维持世界和平”的真面目。
    帝国主义害怕和平。声名狼藉的杜鲁门献“计”人巴鲁区曾率直地告诉纽约学生说：在野蛮的战争时间，和平似乎是了不起的；一旦战争停止，和平就变得可恨了。艾森豪威尔曾狂暴地说：“与其拿到一个和平而必然要毁灭自由人类的思想与理想（这应是华尔街垄断资本家奴役世界的自由理想），还不如冒着一个战争的危险而面对着可能的毁灭。”
    帝国主义者知道时间对于他们是不利的，因此他就狂热地急忙策划反动力量的各种集团和同盟，以实现他们的侵略计划。
    但是，帝国主义者的拼命发动侵略战争，并不是表明帝国主义的强大，而正是表明帝国主义的腐朽和垂死的挣扎。历史的经验教训是：帝国主义反动派的处境愈是无望，它就愈是猖狂、愈昌险。
    毛主席在近三年以前就英明地指示我们：“危机就像一座火山，每天都在威胁美国帝国主义，美国帝国主义就是坐在这座火山上。这种情况，迫使美国帝国主义分子建立了奴役世界的计划，像野兽一样，向欧、亚两洲及其他地方乱窜，集合各国的反动势力，那些被人民唾弃的渣滓，组成帝国主义及反民主的阵营，反对以苏联为首的一切民主势力，准备战争，企图在将来，在遥远的时间内，有一天发动第三次世界大战，打败民主力量”。
    但，战争给帝国主义带来的，将不是“复兴”和“繁荣”；而是它的灭亡！在这条路上，已经有过意大利法西斯的灭亡，德意志法西斯的灭亡，和日本帝国主义的灭亡！
