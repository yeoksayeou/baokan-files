Xinhua News Agency, New York, November 23rd (TASS dispatch): The Political Committee of the UN General Assembly continued its discussion of the Kuomintang's "accusation" case on the afternoon of November 22nd. US Representative Dulles spoke again, saying that the US delegation was prepared to support Syria's suggestion to resubmit the issue to the so-called "Interim Committee" (i.e., the illegal "Little General Assembly").

Polish representative Katz-Suchy then spoke, elaborating in detail on the documents cited in the US State Department's "White Paper," and demonstrating, based on this white paper, the absurdity of the Kuomintang group's accusations against the Soviet Union. Katz-Suchy stated that the Kuomintang's slander case was placed on the agenda of the General Assembly due to the efforts of the US delegation, with the aim not only of defending the corrupt Kuomintang regime but also of attempting to justify the US's aggressive policy in the Far East. Katz-Suchy urged the Political Committee not to take any decision on the Kuomintang's accusation case and not to discuss the issue any further. Katz-Suchy stated that if the member states of the United Nations respect the Chinese people and the UN Charter, they must regard the Kuomintang's accusations as slander and reject them with contempt, and they must deprive those who bring such accusations of the right to use the General Assembly to incite hatred between nations and incite a new world war.

The Canadian and Israeli representatives stated that their delegations agreed with the opinions of the British and Australian delegations and would strongly urge the rejection of the Kuomintang's "accusation" case. The Canadian representative opposed submitting the issue to the so-called Interim Committee for consideration. He said that there is now a tendency to hand over all issues that "the Political Committee itself cannot decide" to this committee.

The Belgian representative stated that his delegation would neither vote in favor of the Kuomintang's proposal nor in favor of Syria's proposal, because it believed that it was useless to change its original attitude, according to which the Belgian delegation had previously voted in favor of the resolution passed by the General Assembly last year regarding the issue currently under discussion.

The El Salvador representative proposed an amendment to the Kuomintang proposal, suggesting that the proposal state that all member states should faithfully abide by the obligations assigned to them by the Fourth General Assembly, instead of the provisions regarding the "investigation team."

The French representative evaded explaining his delegation's attitude towards the proposal currently under consideration, and confined himself to stating that the amendment proposed by the El Salvador delegation was "worthy of attention."

The Philippine and Chilean representatives both supported the Syrian delegation's suggestion to resubmit the Kuomintang's "accusation" case to the so-called "Interim Committee" for consideration.

After the Syrian representative, who had put forward the proposal, made a brief statement, the head of the Belorussian delegation, Kiselev, pointed out that neither legal nor political reasons could justify why the Kuomintang's slander case should continue to be kept on the agenda of the General Assembly. Kiselev cited the communiqué issued by Soviet Foreign Minister Vyshinsky and PRC Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai when exchanging notes on the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance on February 14, 1950, which specifically pointed out that the treaty of August 14, 1945, was invalidated due to the signing of the new treaty between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China.

Kiselev declared that, judging from the entire result of the Political Committee's discussion of the Kuomintang's slander case, the correct approach was to remove the issue from the agenda and never discuss it again.

The Belorussian representative firmly opposed the proposals of the Kuomintang elements and the Syrian delegation, as well as El Salvador's amendment to the Kuomintang proposal.

The Nicaraguan and Egyptian representatives urged the adoption of the Syrian delegation's proposal.

The meeting then adjourned.

The situation in the Political Committee's discussion of the Kuomintang's slander case showed that even countries like Britain, Canada, and Australia, which faithfully support the United States in all other anti-Soviet actions, have openly stated their opposition to continuing the discussion of the Kuomintang's slander case and demanded that it be removed from the UN agenda, because they believe that this proposal would worsen the already tense situation in the Far East.

　　联大政委会继续辩论“控苏案”
    英加澳等国也要求否决
    【新华社讯】塔斯社纽约二十三日电：联大政治委员会在十一月二十二日下午继续讨论国民党的“控诉”案。美国代表杜勒斯再度发言说，美国代表团准备支持叙利亚的再把这个问题提交所谓“临时委员会”（按即非法的“小型联大”）的建议。
    波兰代表卡兹·苏琪接着发言，他详细地论述美国国务院“白皮书”中所引证的文件，并根据这个白皮书，证明国民党集团对苏联的控诉的荒诞可笑。卡兹·苏琪称，国民党的诽谤案是由于美国代表团的努力而被列入大会议程的，其目的不但是要为腐败的国民党政权辩解，而且是企图为美国在远东的侵略政策辩解。卡兹·苏琪敦促政治委员会不要对国民党的控诉案采取任何决定，并且不要再讨论这个问题。卡兹·苏琪称，如果联合国会员国是尊重中国人民和联合国宪章的话，它们就必须将国民党的控诉视为诽谤而蔑视地加以拒绝，并必须剥夺那些提出这种控诉案的人利用联大煽动各国间仇恨和煽动新世界战争的权利。
    加拿大代表和以色列代表称：他们的代表团同意英国和澳大利亚代表团的意见，并将力促否决国民党的“控诉”案。加拿大代表反对把这个问题交所谓临时委员会考虑。他说：现在有一种把“政治委员会本身所不能决定的”一切问题都交给这个委员会的倾向。
    比利时代表称：他的代表团将既不投票赞成国民党的提案，也不投票赞成叙利亚的提案，因为它认为修改它原有的态度是没有用处的，比利时代表团原先曾根据这种态度投票赞成大会在去年通过的关于目前讨论的问题的决议案。
    萨尔瓦多代表对国民党提案提出修正案，建议提案中声明一切会员国都应忠诚地遵守第四届大会交给它们的义务，来代替关于“调查团”的规定。
    法国代表规避说明他的代表团对于目前考虑的提案的态度，而只限于声明萨尔瓦多代表团所提出的修正案是“值得注意的”。
    菲律宾及智利代表都支持叙利亚代表团所提再把国民党的“控诉”案提交所谓“临时委员会”考虑的建议。
    在提出了提案的叙利亚代表发表简短的声明以后，白俄罗斯代表团团长基塞列夫指出：无论法律上的理由或政治上的理由都不能辩解何以要将国民党的诽谤案继续保留在大会的议程上。基塞列夫引述苏联外交部长维辛斯基与中华人民共和国外交部长周恩来就一九五○年二月十四日签订中苏友好同盟互助条约一事交换照会时所发表的公报，其中具体地指明：由于苏联与中华人民共和国间签订了新的条约，一九四五年八月十四日的条约作废。
    基塞列夫宣称：从政治委员会讨论国民党的诽谤案的全部结果看来，正确的办法是从议程上撤销这个问题，并且永远不再讨论这个问题。
    白俄罗斯代表坚决反对国民党分子和叙利亚代表团的提案以及萨尔瓦多对国民党提案的修正案。
    尼加拉瓜及埃及代表敦促通过叙利亚代表团的提案。
    会议随即休会。
    政治委员会讨论国民党的诽谤案的情形表明了：甚至像英国、加拿大及澳大利亚这种在其他一切反苏行动上忠心支持美国的国家，也都公开声言反对继续讨论国民党的诽谤案，并要求将它从联合国议程上撤销，因为它们认为这个提案会使已经紧张的远东局势恶化。
