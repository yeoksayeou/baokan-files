Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 17th (TASS): Sasila Fuskiji, a member of the Soviet delegation attending the Second World Peace Congress, wrote an article in "Pravda" describing his initial impressions during his stay in Warsaw and his meetings with representatives from other countries attending the congress.

Sasila Fuskiji wrote: Representatives—envoys of peace—have come to Warsaw from all over the world. Those representatives from the East passed freely through various free countries. They were greeted with friendship, and everyone sincerely wished them success. Representatives from the West, however, arrived in Warsaw overcoming numerous obstacles and obstructions. Their struggle to defend peace has been combined with the struggle to obtain visas. Some governments dependent on US imperialism did not allow representatives to leave the country, while others did not allow them to enter. The imperialist aggressors tried every possible means to undermine the World Peace Congress. They exhausted means of prohibition, intimidation, and threats. All their efforts were to alienate the peace fighters, to divide them and make them hostile to each other. Sasila Fuskiji emphasized that, however, the powerful mass movement launched to defend peace, the force it generated has overcome all obstacles. The warmongers, by expressing ridiculous opposition, only increased the determination of the peace fighters and strengthened their will. The warmongers' embarrassing and panicky performance has confirmed that the peace movement is a great historical force, shocking the enemies of peace.

Sasila Fuskiji continued: Five years ago, it was difficult to accommodate even a hundred guests in the city of Warsaw. At that time, what appeared before people was just a vast ruin. However, thanks to the historically significant achievements and diligence of the free and democratic people, Warsaw has been restored very quickly. On the eve of the opening of the World Congress, the Soviet representatives toured various parts of the Polish capital. I remember that two years ago, there were only a few restored buildings standing among the ruins, but now people see only some remaining ruins among the completely restored streets. This is the miracle created by the people who have freed themselves from capitalist enslavement and shown real strength, in the patriotic enthusiasm, the miracle of the socialist system.

Sasila Fuskiji further wrote: The first words to be loudly proclaimed in this solemn and magnificent new "Polish Language Publishing House Building" will be words about international peace and the fraternity of all nationalities, spoken in the languages ​​of all nations. From everything, one can experience this fraternity: representatives of various countries received a warm welcome from the people of Poland on their way to Warsaw; the whole city was decorated like a festival, with flags, banners, and huge portraits of Comrades Stalin, Bierut, Mao Zedong, and Kim Il Sung.

Hundreds of representatives from capitalist countries are subjected to suppression and persecution in their own countries for their struggle for peace. In Warsaw, they have personally seen what a peace-loving country is like. As long as the torch of war is seized from the wicked hands of the warmongers, the people of all countries will be able to coexist fraternally.

Sasila Fuskiji finally described the grand occasion of the opening ceremony of the Second World Peace Congress.

　　华沙印象
    萨斯拉夫斯基
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科十七日电：出席第二届世界保卫和平大会的苏联代表团团员萨斯拉夫斯基，在《真理报》上撰文叙述他在华沙盘桓期间以及他与出席和大的其他国家代表们会晤时的最初印象。
    萨斯拉夫斯基写道：代表们——和平的使者们，已从世界各国来到华沙。来自东方的那些代表们，很自由地通过了各个自由的国家。他们受到友好的迎送，大家都真诚地预祝他们成功。来自西方的代表们，则排除重重障碍与阻挠而到华沙。他们为保卫和平而进行的斗争，已与为取得签证而进行的斗争结合起来。依附美帝国主义的各国政府，有些不准代表们出国，有些不准代表们入境。帝国主义侵略者千方百计破坏世界和平大会。他们用尽了禁止、恐吓和威胁的手段。他们所作的一切努力，都是要离间和平斗士们，使他们分裂和互相敌对起来。萨斯拉夫斯基强调指出，但是，为保卫和平而展开的强大的群众运动，其所产生的力量已克服了一切障碍。战争贩子由于表示令人可笑的反对，结果只是使和平斗士们的决心更加增长、意志更加坚强起来。战争煽动者表现得这样狼狈与惊慌失措，已确证了和平运动是一股伟大的历史性的力量，使和平的敌人为之震惊失色。
    萨斯拉夫斯基继续写道：五年前，在华沙这座城市中即使要容纳一百位来宾也很困难。那时，呈现在人们眼前的只是一片广大的废墟。但是，由于自由民主人民富有历史意义的功绩和勤劳，华沙很迅速地复兴起来了。在世界和大开幕的前夕，苏联代表们在波兰首都各地进行了观光。记得两年以前，还只是在废墟中间耸立着少数几座修复的建筑物，而今人们在完全修复的街道中间只看到一些残留的废墟了。这便是已经摆脱了资本主义奴役、并显示出确实具有力量的人民，在爱国主义的热情中所创造出来的奇迹，社会主义制度的奇迹。
    萨斯拉夫斯基进而写道：在这座庄严宏伟的新“波兰语出版社大厦”中初次轰传出来的话，将是用各民族语言说着的关于国际和平与各族人民友爱的话，从一切事物中间都可以体验到这种友爱：各国代表在来华沙途中，都受到波兰各地人民的热忱欢迎；全市布置得像过节一样，悬挂着旗帜、标语牌、以及斯大林、贝鲁特、毛泽东和金日成诸同志的巨幅画像。
    来自资本主义各国的数百名代表们，在自己的祖国因进行争取和平的斗争而备受压制与迫害。他们在华沙亲眼看见了爱好和平的国家是什么样的国家。只要将那战争的火把从战争贩子的罪恶的手中夺取过来，世界各国人民就能够友爱地共处了。
    萨斯拉夫斯基最后叙述了第二届世界保卫和平大会开幕式的盛况。
