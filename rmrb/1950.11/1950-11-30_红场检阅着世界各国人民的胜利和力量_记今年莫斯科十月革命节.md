　　Red Square Reviewing the Victory and Strength of People of All Countries
    Remembering this Year's October Revolution Day in Moscow
    Xu Guming
    Red Square, it is the heart of all progressive mankind. Here lies the mausoleum of Lenin, the great teacher of the proletarian revolution. Every day, from morning till night, the line of people coming to pay their respects to Lenin's remains stretches for miles. For twenty-six years, this flow of people converging from every corner of Moscow, from every corner of the Soviet Union, from every corner of the world has never been interrupted. Here stands the beacon of peace, democracy, and progress—the Kremlin, illuminating the path and direction of human development.
    Today, November 7th, on this anniversary of the October Revolution that marked a new era in human history, the thoughts of people all over the world are concentrated on Red Square, the hearts of people all over the world are turned towards Red Square, and the ears of people all over the world are listening to Red Square. Today, Red Square is reviewing the victory and strength of the people of all countries.
    Red Square is decorated so brilliantly, solemnly, and grandly today, symbolizing the joy, confidence, and hope of the people of all countries.
    Huge slogans covering several floors are hung on the giant buildings around Red Square. On the fiery red silk are the slogans of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party commemorating the 33rd anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution:
    "Under the banner of Lenin, under the leadership of Stalin, advance towards the victory of communism!"
    "Working people of all countries: Expose and crush the criminal conspiracies of the instigators of a new war! Expand and strengthen the mighty camp of peace defenders, and defend the cause of world peace!"
    "Glory to the Soviet armed forces guarding the peace and security of our motherland!"
    In the center of Red Square, on the wall of the high building directly opposite the reviewing stand, hangs the national emblem of the Soviet Union, the first socialist country born out of the October Revolution. Below the national emblem are the portraits of Lenin and Stalin, the leaders and organizers of the October Revolution, the founders of the Soviet state, and the teachers of mankind.
    The grandstand is located next to the Kremlin wall, beside Lenin's Mausoleum. From afar, one can see the leaders of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party and the Soviet government standing on the reviewing stand. The grandstand is crowded with guests from various countries and the most outstanding sons and daughters of the Soviet people—representatives of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, representatives of the Supreme Soviets of the Soviet Republics, Heroes of the Soviet Union, Heroes of Socialist Labor, Stakhanovite workers from Moscow factories, and the most outstanding representatives of Soviet science, literature, and art. I will always remember this day, standing together with these outstanding people in this place that people all over the world yearn for, celebrating the glorious victory of the October Revolution. My heart was filled with solemnity, excitement, ecstasy, happiness, and gratitude.
    At exactly ten o'clock in the morning, the chimes of the Kremlin announced the beginning of the historically significant military parade and procession.
    Marshal Budyonny, the reviewing officer, galloped into the square on his steed. All eyes were focused on him. People remembered with respect and love his immortal achievements in the war against the White bandit army of domestic counter-revolution and the interventionist armies of foreign imperialism. From his heroic, steady, majestic, and resolute riding posture, one could see the indomitable will and confidence of victory in every battle of this veteran general who had been tempered in hundreds of battles. He rode around the army, standing in neat formation in the center of Red Square, and congratulated the army on the October Revolution Day. A joyful, enthusiastic, and powerful roar of "Hurrah" greeted him.
    Five minutes later, his loud voice came from the reviewing stand:
    "... The Soviet people are celebrating the anniversary of the Great October Revolution in a high tide of politics and labor. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, under the leadership of the great Stalin, the workers, peasants, and intellectuals of the Soviet Union have won decisive victories in the struggle to victoriously complete the post-war Five-Year Plan...
    The Anglo-American imperialists have now taken open acts of aggression on the basis of preparing for aggression, which is proved by the predatory intervention of the United States in Korea.
    The Soviet people and all freedom-loving people of the world angrily denounced the aggression of the United States and expressed their sympathy to the Korean people who are carrying out a heroic struggle for the freedom of their motherland.
    The wise Stalin's foreign policy and the Soviet Union's thorough and determined struggle for peace and cooperation among all nations are supported by millions of people in all countries!"
    Cheers and applause resounded, and salutes boomed.
    The military band of more than a thousand people played the solemn and majestic Soviet national anthem.
    The military parade began.
    Look!
    The beautiful and heroic navy in black uniforms and white gloves, carrying long rifles, the border guards vigilantly holding shining bayonets, and the brave and vigorous Stalinist eagles.
    The sharpshooters of the motorized Kalinin Division, holding high a flag embroidered with the golden words "Defend the Soviet Motherland." This is their glory and pride. During the Great Patriotic War, they followed this flag through countless arduous battles and brilliant victories. Muscovites remember that the capital fired twenty-three artillery salutes to pay tribute to this flag.
    The Kantemirovsky Division, which defended the heroic Stalingrad, held Kiev, conquered Shepetovka, Krakow, and liberated Czechoslovakia.
    The incomparably powerful artillery team, which has new types of anti-aircraft guns, mortars, various large-caliber guns, and the famous "Katyusha" cannons. The number of enemy bunkers, fortresses, and fortifications destroyed is recorded on the gun barrels.
    Huge, fast, and mobile "T34" tanks, "Joseph Stalin" tanks.
    A storm of applause welcomes this neat line, this steel line, this heroic line, this line marching from victory to victory.
    This is the army of the Soviet state, the first worker-peasant army in history, the army that defeated fascism and saved all of mankind. Today, it solemnly swears again: It vigilantly and faithfully stands on the forward post, defending the socialist motherland, defending world peace and democracy.
    After the military parade, came the mass procession. Twenty columns passed in parallel through Red Square, a sea of people, a sea of flags, a sea of sound waves.
    Twenty-five thousand athletes in various colored sportswear, each so strong, lively, and joyful, full of vitality and joy, displaying unity and friendship. They are the flowers of this festival, symbolizing the youth and prosperity of mankind, symbolizing the Soviet Union's brilliant communist tomorrow.
    The Soviet people are preparing for this tomorrow in a planned, conscious, and selfless labor.
    In the ranks of the workers, many charts, photos, specimens, and models marking communist construction are held high.
    Look! Charts showing the hydroelectric stations and canals of the Volga, Central Asia, Ukraine, and Crimea, models of the great Stalin afforestation plan for transforming nature, specimens of Michurin's improved apple trees, reporting the production figures exceeding the Five-Year Plan in four years and ten months: the Moscow "Sickle and Hammer" metallurgical plant produced an additional 100 million rubles worth of metal, and the "Red Proletarian" machine factory manufactured an additional 1,200 machines.
    In the ranks of intellectuals, students of Moscow State Lomonosov University held up samples of Stalin's brilliant work "Marxism and Problems of Linguistics." Filmmakers held up the model of the "Crystal Dove" award won by the film "The Fall of Berlin" at the international film festival.
    These are the miracles created by labor in the Stalin era, the glory of science, literature, and art in the Stalin era. The Soviet people cheered for their thirty-three years of victory, and they sincerely thanked the organizer and inspirer of this victory—the Bolshevik Party and Stalin. The countless flags, slogans, and mottos all repeated one sentence: "Glory to the Bolshevik Party, glory to Stalin."
    The Soviet people not only cheered for their own victory but also for the victory of their close brothers, the Chinese people.
    Portraits of the leaders of the Chinese people, Mao Zedong, Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, and Zhu De, constantly appeared in the sea of people.
    When the marchers passed in front of the Chinese guests, they enthusiastically shouted: "Long live Mao Zedong!" and warmly raised flowers, waving their hands to greet us.
    "Long live the heroic Chinese people!" A loud voice came from the rostrum.
    "Hurrah!" The whole audience responded with cheers. This powerful voice was filled with love and respect for the Chinese people. The great Chinese people, who have defeated domestic and foreign reactionaries and are increasingly consolidating and developing their victory, can accept this lofty honor and precious friendship without shame.
    The unprecedented growth of the international democratic camp and the growing strength of the people of all countries are all concentrated in this procession.
    The marchers held high portraits of the leaders of various people's democratic countries. Behind Chairman Mao's portrait was the line of people's democratic countries: Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, Albania, Mongolia, as well as the newborn Germany, and the fighting Korea and Vietnam.
    In addition, what was exciting were the portraits of the leaders of the communist parties of capitalist countries. They represent the strength of the working people of the world closely united around the Communist Party, and they are also a sign of the growing strength of the people of all countries. Among these portraits are Togliatti, Thorez, Pollitt, Foster—the flags of the people of capitalist countries.
    This is the victory of the October Revolution, this is the victory of all progressive mankind. Today, the Soviet people and the people of all countries celebrate this common victory together and reiterate their common determination to consolidate this victory.
    The parade on Red Square is not only a grand review of the victory of the people of all countries but also a great demonstration to defend world peace.
    A large wooden board was raised high in the crowd, with the Stockholm Peace Appeal and the number of signatories worldwide—500 million people—written on it.
    Another striking wooden board, on which was written the first decree promulgated by the Soviet state—the Decree on Peace signed by Lenin. This historically significant decree not only proved the Soviet Union's consistent loyalty to the cause of peace, but also proved that socialism and the cause of peace are rooted together. Socialist Soviet Union is a bastion of peace, uniting all peace-loving people around it.
    "Defend world peace, oppose wars of aggression."
    "Crush the conspiracies of the instigators of war."
    Many slogans and posters were written with these resounding slogans, which are a head-on blow to the instigators of war.
    I saw a poster that said: "American soldiers! Get out of Korea!" showing the immense hatred for the American aggressors.
    I saw behind the portrait of General Kim Il-sung a large banner couplet, with the slogan of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party: "Brotherly greetings to the heroic Korean people who are defending the independence of their motherland!" It showed the deep sympathy and moral support of the Soviet people for the Korean people.
    In the loud songs of defending peace, the marchers carried the portraits of Stalin and Mao Zedong side by side. People remember that on February 14th of this year, right here in the Kremlin on Red Square, the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance of world significance was signed. History will prove that the alliance of the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union is a solid guarantee of world peace.
    In this mighty October Festival parade, I saw a clear flag that read: "Peace will defeat war," which expresses the determination, confidence, and strength of people all over the world fighting for peace.
    Red Square, the heart of progressive mankind, is throbbing violently today. In its vibrant throbbing, I hear the unified, powerful, and resolute voice of the people of all countries: "Defend lasting peace, uphold people's democracy." This voice pronounces the death sentence on the imperialist warmongers, let them tremble before this historical verdict! Let them perish in this historical verdict!
    History stands on the side of peace and democracy, the people stand on the side of peace and democracy, the train of history cannot be stopped, and the power of the people is invincible. The banner of the victorious October Revolution leads the ranks of world peace and democracy forward, forward, and forward again.

　　红场检阅着世界各国人民的胜利和力量
    记今年莫斯科十月革命节
    徐谷明
    红场，它是整个进步人类的心脏。这里座落着伟大的无产阶级革命的导师列宁的陵墓，每天，从早到晚，前来瞻仰列宁遗容的队伍排列几里长，二十六年来，这一条从莫斯科各个角落、从苏联各个角落、从世界各个角落汇合来的人流从来没有中断过。这里耸立着和平、民主、进步的灯塔——克里姆林宫，它照耀着人类发展的道路和方向。
    今天，十一月七日，在这个标志着人类历史新纪元的十月革命纪念日，世界各国人民的思想都集中在红场，世界各国人民的心都朝向着红场，世界各国人民的耳朵都倾听着红场。今天，红场检阅着世界各国人民的胜利和力量。
    红场今天装饰得多么灿烂、庄严、堂皇，正象征着世界各国人民的欢乐、信心和希望。
    红场四周的巨厦上挂着掩盖了几层楼的巨幅标语，火红的绸子上写着联共中央纪念伟大的十月社会主义革命三十三周年的口号：
    “在列宁的旗帜下，在斯大林的领导下，向共产主义的胜利前进！”
    “各国的劳动人民们：揭露并粉碎新战争挑拨者的罪恶阴谋！，扩大并加强强大的和平拥护者阵线，拥护世界和平事业！”
    “光荣归于警卫着我们祖国的和平与安全的苏联武装部队！”
    红场中央、检阅台正对面的高楼的墙壁上悬挂着十月革命的产儿第一个社会主义国家苏联的国徽，国徽下面是十月革命的领导者和组织者、苏维埃国家的奠基者、人类的导师列宁和斯大林的画像。
    观礼台就在克里姆林宫墙边，列宁陵墓旁，远远可以看见站在检阅台上的联共中央和苏联政府的首长们。观礼台上挤满了各国的来宾和苏联人民最优秀的儿女们——苏联最高苏维埃代表们，苏联各共和国最高苏维埃代表们，苏联英雄们，社会主义劳动英雄们，莫斯科各工厂的斯达哈诺夫工作者们，苏联科学、文学、艺术工作者的最杰出的代表们。我永远记得这一天，在这全世界人民向往着的地方，和这些优秀的人们站在一起欢庆十月革命的光辉胜利。我的心里充满了严肃、兴奋、狂喜、幸福和感激。
    早晨十时正，克里姆林宫的钟声报告了具有历史意义的阅兵典礼和游行的开始。
    检阅官布琼尼元师骑着骏马驰骋入场，全场的视线都集中在他身上，人们怀着尊敬和热爱铭记着他在反对国内反革命的白匪军和国外帝国主义的干涉军的战争中所建立的不朽的功勋，从他那英勇、稳健、威严和坚决的骑姿上可以看出这位百炼成钢的老将军的不屈不挠的意志和百战百胜的信心。他绕着整齐肃立在红场中央的军队巡行一周，向军队祝贺十月革命节，一片欢乐、热烈、强有力的“乌拉”的欢呼声迎送着他。
    五分钟后，检阅台上传来了他的宏亮的声音：
    “……苏联人民是在政治和劳动的高潮中庆祝伟大的十月革命纪念日，在共产党的领导下，在伟大的斯大林的领导下，苏联的工人们、农民们、知识分子们在争取胜利完成战后五年计划的斗争中获得了决定性的胜利……
    英美帝国主义者们由准备侵略现在进而采取了公然的侵略行动，美国在朝鲜的强盗式的干涉行动就证明着这一点。
    苏联人和全世界爱好自由的人民愤怒地斥责美国的侵略并对为自己的祖国的自由而进行着英勇斗争的朝鲜人民表示同情：
    英明的斯大林的外交政策和苏联争取和平及各国人民的合作的彻底的坚决的斗争，得到各国千百万人的支持！……”
    欢呼声，掌声，震响着，礼炮轰鸣着。
    一千多人的军乐队奏着庄严雄伟的苏联国歌。
    阅兵开始了。
    看！
    穿黑制服戴白手套背长枪的美丽而英武的海军，警惕地擎着闪亮的枪刺的边防军，英勇的矫健的斯大林鹰。
    摩托化的加里宁师的狙击兵，他们高举着一面绣有“保卫苏维埃祖国”的金字的旗帜，这是他们的光荣和骄傲，在伟大的卫国战争里他们跟随着这旗帜走过无数艰苦战斗和辉煌胜利的道路，莫斯科人记得，首都曾鸣过礼炮二十三次向这面旗帜致敬。
    保卫过英雄的斯大林格勒，坚守过基辅，攻克了谢别托夫克、克拉哥夫，解放了捷克的康登米洛夫斯基师。
    威力无比的炮兵队，它拥有新型的高射炮、迫击炮、各种大口径的炮，还有著名的“卡秋莎”炮，炮身上记录着摧毁敌人的碉堡、堡垒和防御工事的数目。
    庞大的快速度的、机动的“Ｔ３４”型坦克，“约·斯大林”型坦克。
    暴风雨般的掌声欢迎着这整齐的行列，钢铁的行列，英雄的行列，从胜利走向胜利的行列。
    这是苏维埃国家的军队，这是历史上第一支工农的军队，这是打垮了法西斯拯救了全人类的军队。今天，它再度庄严地宣誓：它警惕地、忠诚地，站在前哨岗位上捍卫着社会主义的祖国，捍卫着全世界的和平和民主。
    阅兵之后是群众游行。二十个纵队浩浩荡荡地平行地经过红场，一片人的海，旗帜的海，声浪的海。
    二万五千名穿着各色运动服的运动员，一个个那么健壮、活跃、愉快，充满着生命力和欢乐，显示着团结和友爱。他们是这节日的花朵，它象征着人类的青春和繁荣，它象征着苏联的灿烂的共产主义的明天。
    苏联人民有计划地、自觉地、用忘我的劳动来准备着这明天。
    劳动者的行列里高举着许许多多标志共产主义建设的图表、照片、标本和模型。
    看！表现伏尔加、中亚细亚、乌克兰、克里米亚的水电站和运河的图表，伟大的改造自然的斯大林造林计划的模型，米丘林改良种苹果树的标本，报告着在四年零十个月中超过了五年计划的生产数目字：莫斯科“镰刀斧头”冶金厂多生产了一万万卢布价值的金属，“红普罗列塔利”机器厂多制造了一千二百架机器。
    知识分子的队伍里，莫斯科国立罗莫诺索夫大学的学生高举着斯大林的光辉著作《马克思主义和语言学问题》的样本。电影工作者高举着影片《攻克柏林》在国际电影节上所获得的奖品“水晶鸽”的模型。
    这是斯大林时代劳动创造的奇迹，这是斯大林时代科学、文学、艺术的光辉。苏联人民欢呼着自己三十三年来的胜利，他们衷心感谢这胜利的组织者和鼓舞者——布尔什维克党和斯大林。那无数的旗帜、标语、和口号都重复着一句话“光荣属于布尔什维克党，光荣属于斯大林”。
    苏联人民不仅欢呼着自己的胜利，也欢呼着他们的亲密的兄弟中国人民的胜利。
    人海里不断出现中国人民的领袖们毛泽东、刘少奇、周恩来、朱德的肖像。
    当游行者经过中国来宾面前时，他们热烈地高呼：“毛泽东万岁”并且热情地举起鲜花，挥动着双手向我们致意。
    “英勇的中国人民万岁！”主席台上传来了响亮的声音。
    “乌拉！”全场一致用欢呼响应着。这强有力的声音充满着对中国人民的热爱和尊敬。战胜了国内外的反动派、并且日益巩固着发展着自己的胜利的伟大的中国人民，可以毫无愧色地接受这崇高的荣誉和珍贵的友情。
    国际民主阵营的空前壮大，世界各国人民力量的日益成长，都在这游行里找到了集中的反映。
    游行者高举着各人民民主国家的领袖像，毛主席的肖像的后面，是人民民主国家的行列：波兰、捷克、匈牙利、罗马尼亚、阿尔巴尼亚、蒙古，还有新生的德国，战斗着的朝鲜和越南。
    此外，令人兴奋的，是资本主义各国共产党领袖的肖像。他们代表着紧紧团结在共产党周围的全世界劳动人民的力量，他们也是各国人民力量日益成长的标志。这些肖像中有托里亚蒂、多列士、波立特、福斯特——资本主义国家的人民的旗帜。
    这是十月革命的胜利，这是整个进步人类的胜利。今天，苏联人民和世界各国人民一起欢庆这共同的胜利并且再度表示共同巩固这胜利的决心。
    红场上的游行不仅是世界各国人民的胜利的大检阅，也是保卫世界和平的大示威。
    人群里高高举起一块大木板，上面写着斯德哥尔摩的和平宣言和全世界签名者的数目——五亿人。
    又一块引人注目的大木板，上面写着苏维埃国家所颁布的第一道法令——列宁签署的和平法令，这具有历史意义的法令不仅证明了苏联对和平事业的一贯忠诚，而且证明了社会主义与和平事业是并根成长的，社会主义的苏联是和平的堡垒，它将全世界爱好和平的人们紧紧地团结在自己的周围。
    “保卫世界和平，反对侵略战争。”
    “粉碎战争侵略者的阴谋。”
    许许多多的标语，和招贴画都写着这些响亮的口号，这是给战争挑拨者的当头一棒。
    我看见招贴画上写着：“美国兵！滚出朝鲜境！”表现了对美国侵略者的无比憎恨。
    我看见金日成将军的画像后面是一幅大标语联，写着联共中央的口号：“向英勇地保卫祖国独立的朝鲜人民致兄弟的敬礼！”它表现了苏联人民对朝鲜人民的深厚的同情和道义上的支持。
    在保卫和平的响亮的歌声里，游行者并排地抬着斯大林的像和毛泽东的像，人们记得今年二月十四日，就在这红场上的克里姆林宫里，签订了具有世界意义的中苏友好同盟互助条约，历史将证明中苏两大国家的同盟是世界和平的坚固的保证。
    在这浩浩荡荡的十月节的游行队伍里，我看见一面鲜明的旗帜写着：“和平将战胜战争”，它表示了全世界为和平而斗争的人们的决心、信心和力量。
    红场，这进步人类的心脏，今天，它剧烈地跳动着。在它的充满生命力的跳动里我听到世界各国人民的一致的强有力的坚决的声音：“保卫持久和平，拥护人民民主。”这声音宣判着帝国主义战争贩子们的死刑，让他们在这历史的宣判面前发抖吧！让他们在这历史的宣判中走向灭亡吧！
    历史站在和平民主这边，人民站在和平民主这边，历史的列车是拖不住的，人民的力量是不可战胜的。胜利的十月革命的旗帜领导着全世界和平民主的队伍向前，向前，再向前。
