　　Resolutely Oppose U.S. Imperialist Aggression, Defend the Motherland, Defend Peace!
    ——Telegrams from People of Various Places to the Committee to Defend World Peace and Oppose American Aggression
            The First Session of the People's Representative Conference of All Ethnic Groups in Qinghai Province cables to the China Committee for the Defense of World Peace:
    The mortal enemy of the Chinese and world people—U.S. imperialism—is wantonly creating wars of aggression. Now it is engaging in mad adventures, invading our friendly neighbor Korea, invading our Taiwan, and sending planes to repeatedly intrude into our country's airspace to reconnoiter, strafe, and bomb, destroying our buildings and killing our peaceful residents. U.S. imperialism has also obstructed our representatives from attending various organizations and meetings of the United Nations, and at the Fifth Session of the United Nations General Assembly, it manipulated the voting machine to pass a proposal to expand the war of aggression against Korea, undermining the UN Charter. All of this shows that U.S. imperialism is the mortal enemy of peace-loving people all over the world. The people of the seven ethnic groups in Qinghai express great indignation at the U.S. imperialist aggression against Korea and Taiwan.
    On the occasion of the first session of the People's Representative Conference of all ethnic groups in our province, we hereby represent the people of all ethnic groups in the province in resolutely expressing our determination to defend the motherland and defend world peace, our determination to closely unite with the socialist country of the Soviet Union and the new democratic countries, and we warmly support Foreign Minister Zhou's statement on October 10 against expanding the war of aggression against Korea. All our representatives have signed the peace declaration, and we will unite more closely, actively support the liberation of Tibet and Taiwan, and use all our strength to resolutely struggle against wars of aggression, to defend the motherland, and to defend world peace.
                                The First Session of the People's Representative Conference of All Ethnic Groups in Qinghai Province
                                        October 26, 1950
            The Entire Delegation of the Guangzhou Youth Workers' Conference Cables to Comrade Guo Moruo, Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for the Defense of World Peace and Opposition to American Aggression:
    Today, as the U.S. imperialist bandits are frantically invading Taiwan and Korea and burning the flames of war to the mainland border of our People's Republic of China, we support the establishment of the conference, respond to your call, and will unite the 100,000 young workers of Guangzhou to resolutely oppose U.S. imperialist aggression against Taiwan and Korea, mobilize to fight for the defense of our great motherland and against U.S. imperialist aggression.
                                The Entire Delegation of the Guangzhou Youth Workers' Conference
                                                  October 28
            The Anti-American Aggression Propaganda Committee of the Department of Mathematics of the Normal University Cables to Respected Mr. Guo Moruo:
    We wholeheartedly support the important resolution to merge and reorganize the "China Committee for the Defense of World Peace" and the "Chinese People's Committee Against American Aggression in Taiwan and Korea" into the "Chinese People's Committee for the Defense of World Peace and Opposition to American Aggression." We are determined to respond to all the calls of the conference with practical actions. In order to strive for lasting world peace and safeguard the permanent security of the motherland, we are willing to dedicate all our strength.
    Now the imperialist bloc headed by the United States is vainly attempting to "cover the sky with one hand," hindering the early arrival of happy days for mankind, and attempting to continue to exploit the people in the world.
    The United States is the creator of poverty and famine, the United States is a robber who kills and sets fires, the United States is the mortal enemy of peace, and the arsonist of war. As long as they exist in the world, peace cannot be fully realized. Therefore, to defend world peace, we must oppose war, and we must overthrow the instigator of war - U.S. imperialism.
    Although the United States is doing its utmost to assist its puppet in China - the mortal enemy of the Chinese people, Chiang Kai-shek, it cannot withstand the powerful force of the Chinese people, and the Chiang bandits will eventually be driven out of the mainland and will eventually be wiped out in Taiwan. However, the ambition of the United States will never die. They are doing everything possible to conspire to restore their plunder and exploitation of the Chinese people. The United States has sent its Seventh Fleet to invade our Taiwan, and it is even betting everything it has by assembling its entire Far East force and invading Korea under the guise of the United Nations, attempting to follow the old path of bloody aggression of the Japanese devils, eyeing our Northeast, and expanding the war of aggression.
    All the teachers and students of the Department of Mathematics of our Normal University feel extremely angry about the U.S. imperialist's mad and shameless bestial aggression, and unanimously demand that we organize and take action to effectively stop the U.S. imperialist's aggressive behavior. Now we have launched our work, paying close attention to the development of the situation, and conducting extensive discussions and propaganda at any time. We want to use our boundless hatred for U.S. imperialism and our confidence in defeating aggression and winning peace to raise this upsurge even higher and push it even further. Our slogan is "Turn anger into strength." In the future, we are willing to fight resolutely under your leadership, at all costs, for world peace and the security of the motherland!
        Sincerely,
    Revolutionary Salute
                          Anti-American Aggression Propaganda Committee of the Department of Mathematics of the Normal University
                                                  October 28
            Uphold the Resolution of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council
            The People's Representative Conference of All Circles in the Tangda District of Tianjin Cables to the World Peace Council: To All Members of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress:
    First of all, we represent the 80,000 Chinese people in the Tangda District of Tianjin to express our highest respect to you. Because in the struggle against wars of aggression and defending world peace, you have promptly exposed the conspiracies of international warfare and cracked down on their every conspiracy activity, thereby strengthening and developing the world's peaceful and democratic forces. This contribution is great, and the people of the world are grateful to you.
    Now the international reactionaries headed by U.S. imperialism have exposed their aggressive true colors to the people without any concealment, openly supporting the reactionary figures of various countries in carrying out barbaric war activities, causing huge losses to the lives and property of tens of millions of people. The people of the world will never tolerate this bestial act of the warmongers. We fully support your various resolutions on striving for world peace and are willing to work hard for the realization of these resolutions.
    The People's Republic of China is the first populous country in Asia, and we bear a major responsibility for the cause of defending peace in the Far East and the Pacific. We are willing to unite closely under your call and jointly strive to the end for the elimination of wars of aggression and the realization of lasting peace and people's democracy.
                    The People's Representative Conference of All Circles in the Tangda District of Tianjin, People's Republic of China

　　坚决反对美帝侵略、保卫祖国、保卫和平！
    ——各地人民致保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会电
            青海省首届各族各界人民代表会议电中国保卫世界和平大会委员会：
    中国和世界人民的死敌——美帝国主义蛮横的制造侵略战争，现又疯狂冒险，侵略我们的友邻朝鲜，侵略我台湾，并派遣飞机，屡次侵入我国领土上空，侦察、扫射、轰炸毁坏我国建筑，杀害我和平居民，派遣军舰炮击我国商船，美帝又阻挠我国代表出席联合国各种组织和会议，在联合国第五届大会上操纵表决机器，通过扩大侵略朝鲜战争的提案，破坏联合国宪章。这一切都说明美帝国主义，是全世界爱好和平人民的死敌。我青海七个民族人民对美帝侵略朝鲜台湾之行为，表示极大的愤慨。
    兹值我省举行首届各族各界人民代表会议之际，谨代表全省各族人民坚决表示我们保卫祖国保卫世界和平的决心，我们与社会主义国家苏联新民主主义国家亲密团结的决心，我们热烈拥护周外长十月十日反对扩大侵朝战争的声明，我们全体代表都在和平宣言上签了名，我们将更紧密地团结，积极支援解放西藏、台湾，用我们一切力量，为反对侵略战争、保卫祖国、保卫世界和平而坚决斗争。
                                青海省首届各族各界人民代表会议
                                        一九五○年十月二十六日
            广州市青工工作会议全体代表电中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会郭沫若主席：
    正当美帝国主义强盗疯狂地侵略台湾朝鲜并把战争火焰烧到我们中华人民共和国的大陆边境的今天，我们拥护大会的成立，响应你的号召，并将团结全广州市十万青年工人，坚决反对美帝国主义侵略台湾、朝鲜，动员起来为保卫我们伟大的祖国和反对美帝的侵略而斗争。
                                广州市青工工作会议全体代表同启
                                                  十月二十八日
            师范大学数学系反对美国侵略宣传委员会电敬爱的郭沫若先生：
    我们衷心拥护将“中国保卫世界和平大会委员会”及“中国人民反对美国侵略台湾朝鲜委员会”合并改组为“中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会”的重要决议。并决以实际行动响应大会的一切号召。为了争取世界持久和平、保卫祖国永久安全，我们愿献出我们所有的力量。
    现在以美帝为首的帝国主义集团，妄想“只手遮天”阻碍人类幸福日子的早日到来，企图继续残存于世界压榨人民。
    美帝是贫困饥馑的制造者，美帝是杀人放火的强盗，美帝是和平的死敌，是战争的放火者。世界上有他们存在一天，和平即不可能彻底实现。所以，我们保卫世界和平，就要反对战争，就要打倒战争的制造者——美帝国主义。
    美帝虽然竭力援助其在中国的傀儡——中国人民的死敌蒋介石，但总抵不住强大的中国人民力量，而蒋匪终被赶出大陆，并将最后被消灭于台湾。可是美帝的野心终不会死的，他们千方百计阴谋恢复其对中国人民掠夺榨取。美帝已派其第七舰队侵占我们的台湾，更不惜孤注一掷的集结其全远东兵力，并假借联合国招牌出兵侵略朝鲜，企图走日本鬼子血腥侵略的旧路，窥我东北，扩大侵略战争。
    我们师大数学系全体师生，对于美帝疯狂无耻的兽性侵略，感到万分愤怒，一致要求组织起来，行动起来，对美帝侵略行为加以有效制止。现在我们已展开工作，密切注意时局的发展，随时进行广泛的讨论与宣传。我们要以对美帝的无比仇恨及反对侵略争取和平的胜利信心，将这热潮掀得更高，推得更大。我们的口号是“化愤怒为力量”，今后愿在您领导下，为争取世界和平、保卫祖国安全进行不惜一切的坚决斗争！
        谨致
    革命敬礼
                          师范大学数学系反对美帝侵略宣传委员会
                                                  十月二十八日
            拥护世界和大常委会决议
            天津市塘大区各界人民代表会议致世界和大电世界保卫和平大会常设委员会全体委员同志们：
    首先我们代表天津市塘大区八万中国人民向你们表示崇高的致敬。因为在反对侵略战争，保卫世界和平的斗争事业中，你们及时的揭穿了国际战争的阴谋，并打击了他们的每一个阴谋活动，因而就壮大与发展了世界和平民主的力量。这种供献是伟大的，全世界人民都在感谢你们。
    现在以美帝国主义为首的国际反动派，已把侵略的真面目毫不隐瞒的暴露在人民的面前，公开扶持各国的反动人物进行野蛮的战争勾当，使成千万人民的生命财产遭到巨大的损失。对于战争贩子们这种兽行，世界人民决不宽容。我们完全拥护你们关于争取世界和平的各项决议，并愿为这些决议的实现而努力。
    中华人民共和国是亚洲第一个人口众多的国家，在保卫远东与太平洋的和平事业上我们负着重大责任。我们愿在你们的号召下紧密团结，共同为消灭侵略战争争取持久和平与人民民主的实现而奋斗到底。
