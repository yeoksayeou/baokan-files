    The American "Freedom of the Press"
    Zhang Xiangnian
    Today, many people still believe that the United States has true democracy and true freedom. However, is this the reality?
    In the summer of 1949, I was studying at the summer school of the University of Pittsburgh. At that time (if I remember correctly), the People's Liberation Army was advancing rapidly southward, and the Kuomintang reactionary government was being beaten so badly that they didn't even have time to run. Many students couldn't get foreign exchange and had no other source of income, so they were looking for jobs everywhere, and I was one of them. I had only been in Pittsburgh for a short time then – about a month or so – and I knew very few people, so finding a job was quite difficult. After several days of running around, there were still no results. One day, someone called me, saying he was a reporter from the Pittsburgh Post (the largest local newspaper), and that he wanted to interview us Chinese students because he had heard that we were in financial difficulties and might be able to help us find work. I had never experienced anything like this before, and I carelessly agreed to him. Afterwards, he called again and said that he couldn't find any other Chinese students, and asked if he could talk to me alone. Since I had only been in Pittsburgh for a short time, and many Chinese students had left the city for the summer, I couldn't find any other students either, so I agreed to talk to him alone. In the afternoon, he picked me up from the school in a car, took two pictures, and then asked me four questions: (1) What is your name and how do you write it? (2) How old are you? (3) What was your previous source of income? (4) Will you return to China in the future? Of course, the first three questions were not worth mentioning. For the last one, I answered very cautiously, saying only: "I am returning." The interview ended like this. I was puzzled as to what was going on. He said he would help me with work, but he didn't even ask anything about it. I was very unhappy and felt that there must be something else going on. Sure enough, that Sunday's newspaper printed my large photo with the headline "Chinese student in U.S. fear to return to red rule China." It also quoted a few sentences that I had never said. I was very angry at the time and immediately wrote a letter to the editor of the newspaper, asking him to correct it. How foolish I was. Think about it, everyone: would I receive a reply or a correction? Of course not, not even a word. What could I do at the time? It was obvious that I had been tricked by those capitalist running dogs. Their article had already been written, and all they needed was a photo and a name. This incident is not something I fabricated. Almost all the Chinese students in Pittsburgh knew about it, and some even had a big fight with me (that was later), blaming me for being so careless and falling into their trap. Who would have thought of such despicable means? Only capitalists would do such a thing.
    Readers, don't think that Pittsburgh is a small city. It is the steelmaking center of the United States, a place where industries are concentrated. Companies such as U.S. Steel, Westinghouse Electric, and General Electric are all located in Pittsburgh, and therefore it is also a place where capitalists are concentrated. Yes, the United States also has democracy and freedom of speech, but these democracy and freedom of speech only belong to those few capitalists. In the United States, the vast majority of newspapers, magazines, radio stations, publishing houses, etc. are controlled by these monopoly capitalists, and these things are their tools for deceiving and麻醉 (má zuì - anesthetizing, numbing, poisoning, also used figuratively to mean deceiving) the American people.

### 美国的“学术自由”

专栏：所谓美国的“民主”和“自由”

    美国的“新闻自由”
    张祥年
    今天还有许多人相信美国是有真正的民主，真正的自由，然而事实是不是这样呢？
    一九四九年的夏天，我在匹兹堡（Pittbuogh）大学念暑期学校，当时是（如果我记得不错）解放大军急急南下，国民党反动政府被打得跑都来不及的时候，许多学生都请不到外汇，又没有别的经济来源，因此在到处找工作，我也是其中的一个。我那时刚到匹兹堡没有多久——大概才一个多月，认识的人也很少，找工作相当困难，经过几天的奔走之后，还没有什么结果。有一天，一个人打电话来找我，他说他是匹兹堡报（当地最大的报纸）的记者，并且说要访问我们中国同学一次，因为听说我们经济状况困难，也许可能在工作上给我们一点帮助。我是没有经过这种事的人，一不谨慎答应了他，随后他又来了个电话，说他找不到别的中国学生，可否和我一个人谈一谈。我因为刚到匹兹堡不久，而且中国学生在暑期中很多都离开了此地，所以我也找不到别的同学，就答应一个人和他谈。他下午用汽车来接我到学校，在拍了两张照片之后，问了我四个问题：（一）什么名字，怎么写？（二）几岁？（三）以前的经济来源；（四）将来回国否？当然前三个问题就不用提了，最后的一个，我很谨慎的，只回答了一句话：“回去的。”这个访问就这样结束了，我很纳闷这是怎么回事？说给我工作上帮忙，可是连什么也没问，我很不高兴，觉得里面一定还有花样。果然那个星期日的报纸上面印着我的大照片，并且大标题写着“在美国中国学生怕回到红色控制下的中国”（原文Chinese student in U.S.fear to return to red rule China）。并且引了几句我从没有说过的话，我当时很气愤，立即写信去给那个报纸的编辑，要求他更正，我是多么的愚蠢，诸位想想：我会得到回音或更正吗？当然没有，连一点消息也没有，我当时还有什么办法？显而易见的我是上了那批资本家的走狗的当，他们的文章早已写好，而所需要只是一张照片，一个姓名而已。这件事并不是我假造的，在匹兹堡的中国同学都差不多知道这件事，甚至有几位和我大吵一架（那是以后的事），怪我为什么如此不小心，上了他们的当。谁会想到这种卑污的手段，只有资本家才会如此。
    读者别以为匹兹堡是个小城，这是美国炼钢中心，工业集中的地方，如美国钢铁公司，西屋电器公司，通用电讯公司等都在匹兹堡，因而这也是个资本家集中的地方。是的，美国也有民主，也有言论自由，但这些民主和言论自由只是属于那些少数的资本家的。在美国极大部分的报纸、杂志、电台、出版事业等都操纵在这些独占资本家手里，而这些东西正是他们用来欺瞒和麻醉美国人民的工具。
