　　Effectively Conducting the Anti-Rumor Struggle

　　Spreading rumors is one of the important methods used by American imperialism and its running dogs, the Kuomintang bandit gangs, to carry out sabotage activities among the masses, because they have no political capital whatsoever and can only rely on shameless rumor-mongering to intimidate the people. Therefore, the anti-rumor struggle has become an important part of suppressing counter-revolutionaries. In the current situation, this struggle has even newer significance. Since American imperialism launched the war of aggression against Korea, lurking Kuomintang special agents have taken the opportunity to spread rumors to cooperate with American imperialism's aggression. The main content of these rumors is to exaggerate the strength of American imperialism, attempting to create a climate of fear of America among the masses and paralyze their fighting spirit. In response to this despicable and malicious conspiracy of the enemy, we must launch a forceful anti-rumor struggle to raise the masses' confidence in victory and actively participate in the movement to resist America, aid Korea, and defend our homes and country.

　　Exposing the Kuomintang bandit gang's rumor-mongering plans and methods is essential for carrying out the anti-rumor struggle. The Kuomintang remnant bandit special agent organs attach great importance to so-called "psychological warfare." According to documents seized by our army, Kuomintang remnant bandit special agent heads Mao Sen, Xu Zhidao, etc., ordered their henchmen to slander our People's Government and "expand propaganda about a Third World War to shake people's hearts." The bandit Secret Bureau stipulated that establishing so-called "enemy-occupied area propaganda organizations" and training rumor-mongering talent was an important task.

　　The rumors fabricated by Kuomintang special agents are mainly spread through reactionary secret societies. Now, reactionary secret societies have established a set of rumor-mongering organizations, making rumor-mongering one of their main activities. According to investigations, the Nine Palace Tao, lurking in Beijing, has established several rumor-mongering stations inside and outside the city. Their rumor drafts have been seized by the People's Public Security organs. Comparing these rumor drafts with the circulating rumors, they are exactly the same. Therefore, severely banning reactionary secret societies is an important step in eliminating rumors.

　　Rumors are inherently absurd and unfounded. However, because China has a vast territory and inconvenient transportation, special agents take the opportunity to fabricate rumors about location B in location A. By the time the masses in location A clarify the truth, special agents have fabricated new rumors. For example, there were rumors in Qingdao that "the Kuomintang counterattacked in Xiamen"; in the Southwest, there were rumors that "Chiang Kai-shek captured Fuzhou." The general public is very concerned about the changing situation that affects their happiness, safety, and security, but they lack knowledge. In a considerable number of people there still exists superstitious thinking and these have become conditions for special agents to exploit to spread rumors. Some special agents, while spreading so-called "testicle cutting" rumors, even made testicles out of lard and threw them on the edge of the village, clearly intending to deceive the masses who lack scientific common sense. And some of our cadres do not have high vigilance, do not see the harm that rumors give to the masses, and usually do not seriously conduct current affairs and science education to the masses. After the rumors occur, they laugh it off, thinking that the masses will never believe it. Therefore, they often do not take a serious attitude to deal with it, and some even adopt a laissez-faire attitude of "ignore the strange, and the strange will defeat itself." These are the main reasons why counter-revolutionary rumors cannot be put out in time.

　　Counter-revolutionary rumor-mongering has already had some adverse effects on the masses' production and life, and has played a certain destructive role in the work of the People's Government. Therefore, rumors must not be ignored, but should be organized by the masses to be eliminated in a timely manner.

　　In order to effectively carry out the anti-rumor struggle, we suggest:

　　First, according to the development of the situation, through various propaganda organizations and propaganda tools, conduct planned and regular current affairs education and scientific education to the masses, explaining from all aspects the strength of the people's power and the enemy's insurmountable weaknesses. This education should first be carried out to all district and village cadres, so that they correctly understand the current situation, "have a bottom line in their hearts," and always maintain a clear mind, not to be confused by rumors. And through them to educate the masses, lead the masses to pursue rumors, investigate rumors, and expose rumor-mongers, so that the anti-rumor struggle becomes a conscious struggle of the masses. Once rumor-mongers are discovered, in addition to sending them to the People's Government for legal action, they should also be made to confess in front of the masses. Letting the rumor-mongers expose the rumors themselves is the easiest way to achieve good results. The Shenyang Public Security Bureau once helped the masses to recognize the faces of the rumor-mongers in this way. This method can be promoted. But in mobilizing the masses to investigate rumors, attention should be paid to preventing possible deviations, avoiding causing public anxiety, and to improve the masses' enthusiasm to boldly expose rumors.

　　Appropriately controlling and monitoring sabotage elements is also one of the methods of the anti-rumor struggle. Local governments should also strengthen investigation and research work, dispatch capable cadres, and conduct investigation and research with emphasis; in places where the mass work foundation is better, positive activists among the masses should be cultivated, and rumors should be investigated to the end immediately upon discovery. For sabotage elements who specialize in spreading rumors, especially those who have been educated by the People's Government and are unwilling to repent, they must be severely punished and their crimes publicly exposed to the masses. Only in this way can the source of rumors be effectively eliminated.

　　We the people represent the truth, the power of the people is strong, and we also have rich experience in the anti-rumor struggle. As long as we carry forward these advantages, we will surely be able to victoriously smash all counter-revolutionary rumors.

### 有效地进行反谣言斗争

　　有效地进行反谣言斗争
    造谣是美帝国主义及其走狗国民党匪帮在群众中进行破坏活动的重要方法之一，因为他们没有任何政治资本，只能凭借无耻的造谣，来恫吓人民。因此，反谣言斗争便成为镇压反革命的重要一环。在目前形势下，这种斗争更有新的意义。自美帝国主义发动侵略朝鲜的战争以后，潜伏的国民党特务就趁机造谣，来配合美帝国主义的侵略。这些谣言的主要内容是夸大美帝国主义的力量，企图借此造成群众的恐美心理，麻痹群众的斗志。针对敌人这种卑鄙恶毒的阴谋，我们必须开展有力的反谣言斗争，以提高群众的胜利信心，积极参加抗美援朝保家卫国运动。
    揭露国民党匪帮的造谣计划和方法，对于进行反谣言斗争是十分必要的。国民党残匪特务机关十分重视所谓“心理战”。据我军缴获的文件，国民党残匪特务头子毛森、徐志道等曾勒令其喽罗诬蔑我人民政府，并“扩大三次世界大战宣传，动摇人心”。匪保密局把建立所谓“敌后宣传机构”，训练造谣人材，规定为重要任务。
    国民党特务捏造的谣言，主要是通过反动会门来散播的。现在，反动会门已经建立了一套造谣机构，把造谣当作了主要活动之一。据调查，潜藏在北京市的九宫道，已在市内外建立了若干造谣站。他们的谣言底稿已被人民公安机关查获。拿这些谣言底稿和流行的谣言相对照，竟是毫无二致。因此，严厉取缔反动会门，乃是肃清谣言的重要步骤。
    谣言本来是荒诞无稽的。但是因为我国幅员广大，交通不便，特务就乘机在甲地捏造乙地的谣言。等到甲地群众弄清事实真相时，特务分子又捏造出新的谣言。例如青岛曾谣传“国民党在厦门反攻”；西南则谣传“蒋介石打下了福州”。一般群众对于自己幸福安危所杀的时局变化，非常关心，而又缺乏知识，在相当数量的群众中，还存在着迷信思想，这些都成了特务们钻空子造谣的条件。某些特务，一面散播所谓“割蛋”的谣言，一面用猪油制成睾丸，抛在村边，更显然是想欺骗缺乏科学常识的群众。而我们有一部分干部警惕性不高，看不清谣言所给予群众的危害，平时既不认真向群众进行时事与科学教育，在谣言发生以后，又一笑置之，以为群众决不会相信。因此，往往没有采取严肃的态度加以处理，有的甚至采取了“见怪不怪，其怪自败”的放任态度。这些就是反革命谣言还不能及时被扑灭的主要原因。
    反革命的造谣，已经给予群众的生产与生活以某些不利的影响，并对人民政府的若干工作，起了某些破坏作用。因此，对于谣言决不能放任不管，而应该组织群众及时予以肃清。
    为了有效地进行反谣言斗争，我们建议：
    首先，根据形势的发展，通过各种宣传机构、宣传工具，有计划地经常向群众进行时事教育和科学教育，从各方面说明人民力量的强大和敌人的不可克服的弱点。这种教育，应首先向全体区村干部来进行，使他们正确认识时局，“心里有底”，经常保持清醒的头脑，不为谣言所惑。并经过他们去教育群众，领导群众进行追谣、查谣、检举造谣分子，使反谣言斗争成为群众自觉的斗争。一旦发现了造谣分子，除送人民政府法办外，还应该使他在群众中进行坦白。让造谣分子自己揭破谣言，最易获得良好效果。沈阳市公安局曾以此帮助群众认识了造谣分子的面目。这种方法可以推广。但在发动群众追查谣言时，应注意防止可能发生的偏向，避免引起群众不安，而要提高群众大胆揭露谣言的积极性。
    适当地管制与监视破坏分子，也是反谣言斗争的方法之一。各地政府还应该加强调查研究工作，派遣得力干部，有重点地进行调查研究；在群众工作基础较好的地方，应培养群众中的积极分子，发现谣言，立即追查到底。对于专事造谣的破坏分子，特别是经过人民政府教育而不愿改悔的造谣分子，必须给以严厉制裁，并在群众中公开揭露他们的罪恶。这样才能有效地肃清谣言的来源。
    我们人民代表着真理，人民的力量是强大的，我们也有丰富的反谣言斗争的经验，只要发扬这些优越性，就一定能够胜利地粉碎一切反革命的谣言。
