　　Socialism's Advantage Over Capitalist Economic Power
Editor's Note: This article is translated from the first issue of the Soviet Union's newly launched magazine "New Education" in October of this year. It uses recently collected figures and facts to provide a clear contrast between the current situations of the socialist and capitalist systems. From this, it can be seen how the strength of the imperialist war camp headed by the United States is in an inferior position. The original title was "Figures and Facts," and the current title was changed by the newspaper editor.

　　The Growth of the Soviet Economy and the Material Welfare of Soviet Workers

　　Life brings ever-changing facts. These facts prove that the socialist system is immeasurably superior to the capitalist system. While the Soviet national economy is steadily rising and the material welfare and cultural level of the Soviet people are constantly increasing, in capitalist countries, production declines and the living conditions of workers deteriorate tragically. The following facts and figures clearly point this out.

　　The socialist country, the Soviet Union, has not only reached but also exceeded the pre-war level in all fields of the national economy. The total industrial output in 1949 increased by 41 percent compared to 1940. By the end of 1949, the total industrial output exceeded the planned level for 1950 (the final year) stipulated in the Five-Year Plan. The total agricultural output in 1949 also exceeded the pre-war level of 1940.

　　As early as the first Stalin Five-Year Plan, the Soviet Union had surpassed capitalist countries in terms of economic development speed. The speed of industrial development in the Soviet Union has been ten times higher than that of the United States in the past twenty years. In the post-war period, the industrial and agricultural development of the Soviet Union has reached an even higher speed. The average annual increase in industrial products was 22 percent in the first Five-Year Plan, 17.1 percent in the second Five-Year Plan, and 22.5 percent in the last three years.

　　The fourth year of the post-war Stalin Five-Year Plan was characterized by an unprecedented scale of capital construction. During the first Five-Year Plan, the Soviet Union built 1,500 industrial enterprises; during the second Five-Year Plan, 4,500 enterprises were built; and in the fourth year of the post-war Five-Year Plan, 5,200 enterprises were restored and built. In 1949, the scope of Soviet industrial capital work was almost twice that of the best years before the war.

　　New and brilliant evidence of the great strength of the socialist system is the Soviet Council of Ministers' resolution on the construction of the world's largest hydroelectric power station on the Volga River, the construction of the Turkmen Main Canal, the Kakhovka Hydroelectric Power Station on the Dnieper River, the South Ukraine Canal, and the North Crimea Canal.

　　The implementation of these historic resolutions of the Soviet government has opened up unprecedented prospects for the development of our productive forces and has taken a major step forward in building the material and technical foundation of communism.

　　The total power generation of the Kuibyshev and Stalingrad hydroelectric power stations reaches nearly four million kilowatts. Approximately 20 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity can be generated annually to meet the needs of the national economy and irrigate approximately 14 million hectares of land. This exceeds the total power generation of all power stations in pre-revolutionary Russia by ten times. The new hydroelectric station on the Dnieper River, the construction of canals and irrigation systems in southern Ukraine and northern Crimea, can irrigate 1.5 million hectares of land, divert water to more than 1.7 million hectares of arid land, and supply agriculture and industry with electricity.

　　The Turkmen Main Canal, the world's largest canal with a total length of 1,100 kilometers, is scheduled to be completed in 1957. This speed and scale of water conservancy construction is unprecedented in history. The Turkmen Main Canal guarantees irrigation of 1.3 million hectares of land and diverts water to 7 million hectares of pasture land in the Kara-Kum Desert.

　　Thanks to the constant concern of the Party and the government, Soviet agriculture has achieved great success on the basis of improving crop production. In 1949, the cultivated area increased by approximately 6 million hectares.

　　The technical equipment of agriculture is constantly improving. In 1949, agriculture received three to four times more tractors, automobiles, and agricultural machinery from the state than in 1940.

　　The Soviet socialist system has freed itself from crises and unemployment, guaranteeing the continuous rise of the people's material welfare and culture. The number of workers and staff members and their real wages are constantly increasing, as is the income of collective farmers. In 1949, the income of workers and staff members in each job was 24 percent higher than in 1940. The income of farmers increased by 30 percent.

　　Prices are systematically lowered; the purchasing power of the ruble rises. The three price reductions of necessities implemented in the post-war period have given the Soviet people a benefit of approximately 267 billion rubles. The consumption of the most important foods in 1949 has already exceeded that of the pre-war year of 1940.

　　Residential construction is also on a large scale. Between 1946 and 1949, 72 million square meters of living space were built or repaired in cities, and 2.3 million houses were built or repaired in rural areas.

　　Simultaneous with the growth of the material well-being of the workers, their cultural level has also steadily improved. The number of young people graduating from incomplete middle schools or middle schools is increasing year by year. More than 36 million people are studying in primary schools, seven-year schools, middle schools, and specialized schools. There are 1,128,000 university students in institutions of higher education.

　　Economic Decline and Increased Poverty of Workers in Capitalist Countries

　　The ruling groups of imperialist countries, in order to carry out anti-people aggression policies, use most of the national budget for war. Compared with 1938-39, the US government's military expenditure expanded twelve times to 76 percent of the total US budget in 1949-50. Due to the aggressive war in Korea, the US government has requested an additional $16 billion for military needs. Military expenditures in Britain and France are also expanding significantly.

　　The intensification of the arms race cannot prevent the capitalist economy from falling further. Last year, the level of industrial production in the United States fell by 22 percent. Compared with 1948, the production of pig iron decreased by 6 million tons, and steel decreased by 11 million tons. In the first quarter of 1950, compared with the same quarter in 1949, the production of pig iron in the United States was reduced by another 3 million tons. In 1950, the production of coal in Britain, France, and Italy all decreased.

　　The number of fully unemployed and partially unemployed people in capitalist countries has reached 45 million; including 18 million in the United States, 13 million in Japan, and nearly 2 million in West Germany.

　　The increase in military budgets in the United States and European Marshall Plan countries has led to a significant decline in the living standards of workers. Taxes, which are the entire burden on the working people, are increasing. In the United States, tax revenue in the 1950-51 fiscal year has expanded eight times compared with the 1938-39 fiscal year; British tax revenue has increased more than four times. French tax revenue has increased thirty times compared with pre-war levels.

　　Rising prices, falling wages, and increased taxes have greatly reduced the amount of necessities consumed by workers in capitalist countries. For example, in Britain, the average consumption of meat is 28 percent lower than before the war, butter is 40 percent lower, and rice is 50 percent lower.

　　The governments of the United States and Marshall Plan countries are increasing military budgets while sharply reducing funds for social and cultural needs of residents. This year's education expenses in the United States are only one seventy-fifth of the funds used to prepare for war. The French government's education expenses have also been greatly reduced, but the disgraceful war it is waging in Vietnam costs the equivalent of the number of schools needed to build 111 schools a day.

　　In capitalist countries, while the living standards of workers are declining, the income of monopoly capitalists continues to increase. In the United States, the net profit of monopoly capitalists was $2.3 billion in 1938 and $21.2 billion in 1948, which means it increased tenfold. In Britain, the earnings of monopoly capital increased from 676.6 million pounds to 1,275.5 million pounds during these years. The net profits of individual monopoly capitalists in the United States have reached an unprecedented scale. In the first five months of 1950, the profits of 1,183 British companies increased by 26 million pounds compared with the same period last year.

　　社会主义对资本主义经济力量的优势
    编者按：本文译自本年十月份苏联新创刊的《新教育》杂志第一期。它用最近所搜集的数字和事实给社会主义和资本主义两种制度的现状作了鲜明的对照。从这里可以看出以美国为首的帝国主义战争阵营的力量怎样处于劣势的地位。原文标题为《数字和事实》，现在的标题是本报编者所改的。
    苏维埃经济与苏联劳动者物质福利的增长
    生活带来了日新月异的事实。这些事实证明社会主义制度无可衡量地优越于资本主义制度。在苏联国民经济稳步上升，苏联人民的物质福利和文化水平不断增高的时候，在资本主义国家中，则生产降落，劳动者的生活条件悲惨地恶化。下列的事实和数字明显地指出了这点。”
    社会主义国家苏联，在国民经济的各领域中，不仅达到了而且还超过了战前水平。一九四九年全体工业的总产量比一九四○年增长了百分之四十一。至一九四九年底，工业总产量超过了五年计划所规定的一九五○年（最后一年）的计划水平。一九四九年农业的总产量，也超过了战前一九四○年的水平。
    远在第一个斯大林五年计划时期中，苏联在经济发展速度上就已超过了资本主义国家。苏联工业发展的速度，近二十年来比美国高过十倍。战后时期，苏联的工业与农业发展，达到了更高的速度。工业产品每年平均的增加数，在第一个五年计划中是百分之二十二，第二个五年计划中是百分之十七点一，最近三年则为百分之二十二点五。
    战后斯大林五年计划的第四年，以资金建设的空前规模为特点。在第一个五年计划时期，苏联曾建设了一千五百个工业企业，第二个五年计划时期，建设了四千五百个企业，而在战后五年计划的第四年，恢复和建设了五千二百个企业。一九四九年苏联工业资金工作的范围，几乎为战前最好年代的两倍。
    社会主义制度伟大力量的新的光辉证据，就是苏联部长会议关于在伏尔加河上建设世界最大水力发电站，建设土库曼大运河，德聂泊河卡霍夫卡水力发电站，南乌克兰运河和北克里米亚运河的决议。
    苏联政府的这些历史性决议的实现，给我国生产力的发展，打开了空前的远景，并且在建筑共产主义的物质技术基础上，迈进了一大步。
    古比雪夫和斯大林格勒两水力发电站的总发电量达，几四百万基罗瓦特。每年可以发出大约二百亿基罗瓦特小时的电量，供给国民经济的需要，灌溉大约一千四百万公顷土地。这超过了革命前俄国全部电站所发电量的十倍。德聂泊河上的新水力站，在乌克兰南部和克里米亚北部建筑运河与灌溉系统，能灌溉田地一百五十万公顷，引水供给干燥土地一百七十万公顷以上，并供给农业及工业以电力。
    建筑世界上最大的运河全长达一千一百公里的土库曼大运河，预定在一九五七年完成。水利建设的这种速度和规模，是历史上空前的事。土库曼大运河保证灌溉一百三十万公顷土地和引水到七百万公顷卡拉—库玛沙漠上的牧地。
    由于党和政府的不断关切，苏联农业在提高农作物的基础上，达到了巨大的成就。一九四九年，耕地面积增加了约六百万公顷。
    农业的技术装备不断提高。一九四九年，农业由国家收到的拖拉机、汽车和农业机器，比一九四○年多三倍至四倍。
    苏联社会主义制度解脱了危机和失业，保证人民的物质福利与文化的不断高涨。工人与职员的数目和他们的实际工资都不断增加着，集体农民的收入也是如此。一九四九年工人与职员的收入在每一个工作岗位上，都比一九四○年增长了百分之二十四。农民的收入则增长了百分之三十。
    有步骤地降低物价；卢布的购买力上升。战后时期所实行的三次减低必需品的价格，给与苏联人民约二千六百七十亿卢布的利益。最重要的食品消费量，在一九四九年已高过了战前的一九四○年。
    住宅建筑也具有庞大的规模。一九四六——一九四九年间，在各城市中曾建筑或修复了七千二百万米居住面积，农村中建筑或修复了二百三十万所住宅。
    与劳动者物质幸福的增长同时，他们的文化水平也稳步提高了。从不完全的中学或中学中毕业的青年人数，年年增加着。在初级小学，七年学校和中学，专科学校就学的人数共三千六百万人以上。在高等学校中，有一百一十二万八千大学生。
    资本主义国家中经济的下降与劳动者贫穷的加深
    帝国主义国家的统治集团，为了进行反人民的侵略政策，把国家预算的大部分用于战争，与一九三八——三九年度比较起来，美国政府的军事开支至一九四九——五○年度就扩大了十二倍，占美国全部预算的百分之七十六。由于侵略朝鲜战争，美国政府要求再补充军事需要约一百六十亿美元。英法两国的军事支出也大大扩张着。
    军备竞赛的加强是不能使资本主义经济免于进一步跌落的。去年，美国工业生产水平下降了百分之二十二。与一九四八年相比较，生铁的产量减少了六百万吨，钢减少了一千一百万吨。一九五○年第一季与四九年同季比较，美国的生铁产量又缩减了三百万吨。一九五○年，英、法、意各国的石煤产量都缩减了。
    资本主义国家中，完全失业的和部分失业的人数，已达到四千五百万；其中美国一千八百万，日本一千三百万，西德约近二百万。
    美国与欧洲马歇尔化国家军事预算的增长，使得劳动者的生活水平更大大地下降。全部重担压在劳动人民肩头的赋税增长着。在美国，一九五○—五一的会计年度中，税收比一九三八—三九年度扩大了八倍；英国税收增长了四倍多。法国的税收较战前增加了三十倍。
    物价增涨，工资低落，税收加重，使资本主义国家劳动者所消耗的必需品量大减。例如，在英国，肉类的平均消费量比战前降低了百分之二十八，黄油降低了百分之四十，米降低了百分之五十。
    美国及马歇尔化国家的政府增大军事预算，同时又将用于居民社会的及文化的需要的一些款项予以锐减。美国今年的教育费和用于准备战争的经费相较，不过七十五分之一。法国政府的教育费也大大减少，但是它在越南所进行的可耻战争，一天的花费即等于建筑一百一十一所学校所需的数目。
    在资本主义国家中，一面劳动者的生活水平下降，一面独占资本家的收入连续增加。在美国，独占资本家的纯利，在一九三八年为二十三亿美元，在一九四八年则为二百一十二亿美元，这就是说增长了十倍。在英国，这些年中独占资本的收益，从六亿七千六百万英镑增加到十二亿七千五百万英镑。美国个别独占资本家的纯利，达到了空前的规模。一九五○年的前五个月中，一千一百八十三个英国公司的利益与去年同时期比较，增加了二千六百万英镑。（君强译自苏联《党教育》杂志第一期）（附图片）
