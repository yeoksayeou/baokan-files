Xinhua News Agency, 29th – The Financial and Economic Committee of the Central People's Government Administration Council has recently issued the "Measures for Handling the Issue of Year-End Double Pay or Bonuses in 1950." The full text of the measures is as follows:

Due to the lack of a unified system for wage incentives and other issues in public and private enterprises across the country, the following decisions are made regarding the handling of this year's year-end double pay or bonuses:

I. All state-owned enterprises shall be handled in accordance with the "Measures for Handling the Original Year-End Double Pay or Bonuses of Certain State-Owned Enterprises" issued by this committee on December 11th of last year. Those that are excessively unreasonable may be appropriately adjusted with the consent of the labor union.

The measures announced by this committee last year are as follows:

　　(1) All state-owned enterprises that originally did not issue year-end double pay or bonuses shall continue not to issue them.
　　(2) All state-owned enterprises that originally issued year-end double pay or bonuses of no more than half a month's wages shall issue them according to the original amount.
　　(3) All state-owned enterprises that originally issued year-end double pay or bonuses of more than half a month's wages shall issue half a month's wages as double pay or bonuses, and the excess part shall be issued at half the amount, but the maximum shall not exceed two months' wages (including the half month's wages that have not been exceeded), and it may be issued in installments.

II. Private enterprises shall be issued in accordance with the standards of each enterprise last year. If there are significant profits this year, in addition to issuing double pay to workers and staff according to last year's standards, a portion of the profits may be allocated to collective welfare undertakings through consultation between the labor union and the employer. If the business situation is poor and there is no ability to pay double pay, the labor and management may negotiate to reduce or not issue it. If year-end double pay or bonuses were not issued last year, the labor union and the employer may negotiate and decide whether to issue them or how much to issue based on the actual situation. If there are already provisions in the collective contract or agreement originally signed by the labor and management, they shall be handled in accordance with the provisions.

The year-end bonuses of private enterprises may be issued in installments if both parties agree.

　　政务院财经委员会制定
    一九五○年年终双薪或奖金问题处理办法
    【新华社二十九日讯】中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会顷发布《关于一九五○年年终双薪或奖金问题的处理办法》。办法全文如下：
    由于全国公私企业的工资奖励等问题，目前尚未规定统一制度，因此关于今年年终双薪或奖金问题的处理办法，特作如下决定：
    一、所有公营企业单位，一律按照本委去年十二月十一日《关于某些公营企业原有年终双薪或奖金问题的处理办法》处理，过于不合理者，在取得工会同意之下，可作适当调整。
    去年本委公布的办法如下：
    （１）所有公营企业单位，原来不发年终双薪或奖金者，一律照旧不发。
    （２）所有公营企业单位，原来发年终双薪或奖金不超过半个月工资者，照原规定数目发给。
    （３）所有公营企业单位，原来发年终双薪或奖金超过半个月工资者，除发给半个月工资的双薪或奖金外，其超过部分折半发给，但最高不得超过两个月的工资（包括未超过的半个月工资在内），并可分期发给。
    二、私营企业一律按照各该企业去年标准发给，如今年盈余很多者，除按去年标准发给工人职员双薪外，可由工会与资方协商，拨出一部分盈余举办集体福利事业。如营业情况不好，无力发给双薪者，可由劳资双方协商酌量减低或不发。如去年未发年终双薪或奖金者，可由工会与资方协商，根据实际情况，酌情决定发给与否或发多少。如劳资双方原来订立之集体合同或契约中已有规定者，按规定处理。
    私营企业的年终奖金，如双方同意，可分期发给。
