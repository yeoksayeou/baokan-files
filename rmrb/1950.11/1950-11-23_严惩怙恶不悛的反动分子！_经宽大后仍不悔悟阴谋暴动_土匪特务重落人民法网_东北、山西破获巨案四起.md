Severely Punish Reactionaries Who Persist in Their Evil Ways!
    Those Who Remain Unrepentant After Leniency Conspire to Riot
    Bandits and Secret Agents Fall Into the People's Net Again
    Four Major Cases Cracked in Northeast and Shanxi
    [Our Newspaper News] According to the Northeast Daily: The Shenyang Public Security Bureau has cracked the case of the Kuomintang secret agent underground armed organization, the so-called "Northeast Volunteer Corps," plotting rebellion. The ringleaders of the case, Kuomintang former 18th Army Major General Fu Guozheng, Kuomintang former Northeast Headquarters Senior Advisor Fan Weitan, Kuomintang former 53rd Army Colonel Deputy Chief of Staff Liu Dianwu, Kuomintang former 18th Army Major Section Chief and Army Secretary-General Wang Yangshi, Kuomintang former 53rd Army Major Hou Guosheng, and Kuomintang scattered reactionary military officers and police officers Song Zhenhua, Wang Hongzhang, He Yongjiu, Ning Wenguo, and others have all been arrested.
    Since the "August 15th" liberation, the ringleader Fu Guozheng, under the leadership of the Kuomintang Bureau of Investigation and Statistics Northeast Work Supervision Office, has been collecting habitual bandits and hooligans to organize the "Liao, Hei, Re, Cha Self-Defense Army" special agent armed forces, and declared himself "Commander-in-Chief," extorting and committing all kinds of evil. Later, he was incorporated into the pseudo-Northeast Security Ninth Detachment as a Major General Commander by the war criminal Du Yuming, and successively served as a Major General Supervisor of the Political Work Department of the Northeast Security Commander's Headquarters, and a pseudo-53rd Army Cavalry Major General Regiment Commander. After the liberation of Shenyang, he was leniently dismissed and sent back to his hometown by the People's Liberation Army. However, instead of repenting and turning over a new leaf, the criminal continued to be an enemy of the people, constantly fantasizing about the Kuomintang's "comeback," and lurking in Shenyang in the name of business (raising chickens).
    When the American imperialist aggression against the Korean War broke out, a small number of scattered Kuomintang reactionary senior military officers revealed their ugly faces. They believed that "the time had come." Therefore, the ringleaders Fu Guozheng, Fan Weitan, and other reactionary culprits actively recruited former Kuomintang reactionary military officers and gathered scattered remnants, planning to recruit "volunteers and Liberation Army officers" to organize the so-called "Northeast Volunteer Corps," planning to establish two armies and twelve regiments, attempting to widely collect bandits, using tricycle workers, vegetable vendors, and other occupations as cover, waiting for the opportunity to launch armed riots to cooperate with the American and Kuomintang bandits' "comeback" to carry out treasonous and disturbing activities. Especially when American planes invaded our country's airspace and strafed and bombed Andong and other places, the bandit gang became even more frantic, exposing their usual disguise, and preparing to organize a pseudo "Shenyang Temporary Garrison Headquarters," with Fu Guozheng appointing himself as "Commander" and Fan Weitan as "Deputy Commander,"妄图重温其残害人民罪恶统治的迷梦. They also actively expanded their organization, planning to take control of the traffic police, dreaming of maintaining order for the bandits at that time, and secretly planning to use the residence of the Public Security Department of the Northeast People's Government as their office location. They also prepared to distribute reactionary slogans and announcements to incite and disturb people's hearts, and massively manufactured and disseminated rumors such as "The Yalu River Bridge has been blown up, the Kuomintang has already appointed the chairman of Shenyang," "Today we are watching, in the future we will be better," and other absurdities to confuse people's hearts.
    These scattered Kuomintang reactionary military officers are accustomed to harming the people and disturbing the country. They are reactionary by nature and are constantly trying to restore the old order. However, our people's public security personnel have long seen through their tricks, and the bandits' and special agents' wolfish ambitions cannot escape the people's net. The crimes of the bandit agent Fu Guozheng and others are obvious, and the people's public security organs and people's courts are preparing to severely suppress them according to the law.
    [Another News] The Changchun and Liaoxi public security organs have jointly cracked the huge underground armed bandit special agent rebellion case of the Kuomintang Ministry of National Defense Bureau of Investigation and Statistics "Northeast Anti-Enemy People's Self-Defense General Team First Brigade" (the case details were reported in detail on page three of this newspaper on July 29th). The entire case has now been fully interrogated, and the Changchun People's Court has separately sentenced each one according to the law, and has been approved by the Jilin Provincial Government Chairman. The bandit leader and special agent Wei Liancheng (habitual bandit leader, Kuomintang special agent "Liaobei Mobile Team Leader"), Deputy Brigade Leader and special agent Chen Chen (Kuomintang Jianjun, habitual bandit leader), Chief of Staff and special agent Liu Dehui (pseudo police chief, Kuomintang security brigade leader), and the main criminal and special agent escape plotter, habitual bandit Han Fengwu, bandit special agent bandit leader, Kuomintang suppression brigade leader Luo Zhichang, bandit special agent Military Intelligence Bureau commando team, suppression squadron leader, habitual bandit leader Li Shusen, bandit special agent Military Intelligence Bureau commando team, habitual bandit leader Ge Chen, bandit special agent habitual bandit leader, Military Intelligence Bureau armed brigade leader Wang Fu, bandit special agent habitual bandit leader, Military Intelligence Bureau commando team Ji Wanjiang, bandit special agent habitual bandit leader Gao Sheng, bandit special agent Kuomintang Jianjun company commander, habitual bandit rogue Qi Jiang, bandit special agent suppression team Zhang He, and Chen Hesi, who colluded with bandit special agents to not report bandit dens and guns, and thirteen others, were sentenced to death according to law and executed by firing squad at the same time. Secondary bandit special agents and Zhao Kuifu, Sun Fa, and others who harbored bandits and did not report guns were sentenced to imprisonment for more than three years and less than ten years, and deprived of their civil rights. Other coerced members were released after education.
    The components of this case of bandit special agents are all habitual bandits, Kuomintang special agents, scattered officers and soldiers, rogues, and a small number of reactionary landlords. In the past, they were the most determined pawns of the Kuomintang and American bandits, attacking our district and village governments, killing our cadres and masses, harassing our border areas, and robbing the people of grain and property, committing all kinds of evil and being hated by the people, endangering social security. After the complete liberation of our Northeast, the Kuomintang special agents did not give up their evil intentions, actively recruited remnants and gathered remnants to organize the so-called "anti-enemy guerrillas" to carry out robbery and sabotage, murder and robbery, sparing no effort, dreaming of a "comeback." These scum are all full of evil and owe a lot of blood debts. Today, they have received severe punishment from the people, which is their historical inevitable end.
    [Our Newspaper Taiyuan News] The Shanxi Provincial People's Court sentenced the bandit special agents Wang Mingxuan, Cao Yugui, Li Huaizhen, and Yang Zhizhou, the ringleaders of two cases of organizing underground armed conspiracies to rebel, to death on August 5th.
    The three criminals Wang Mingxuan, Cao Yugui, and Li Huaizhen were all born as Yan Xishan bandit military officers and consistently hated the people. After being captured during the liberation of Taiyuan, they were released after being detained and educated, and ordered to return to their hometowns to engage in production. The criminals reorganized the "Datong Socialist Party" in secret in July 1949 and actively engaged in counter-revolutionary activities. In September, they organized the "National Protection and Rebellion Suppression Army Shanxi Provincial Restoration Corps Jinan Column," with Wang Mingxuan as the commander, Cao Yugui and Li Huaizhen as the deputy commanders; and falsely established four brigades and nineteen county detachments in the Jinan area, colluding with habitual bandits, and roping in scattered Yan Xishan bandit officers and soldiers and reactionary landlords to carry out sabotage. Later, after strict investigation by our public security organs, 128 bandits were arrested, and three pistols, eight packs of explosives, forty-eight bullets, fake Ministry of National Defense appointment orders, work permits, and other reactionary documents were seized.
    The rebel Yang Zhizhou had successively served as a Yan Xishan bandit battalion commander and staff officer. He was captured during the liberation of Taiyuan. After being released, he still showed no sign of repentance and secretly organized the "People's Justice Party," actively colluding with former Yan Xishan bandit officers and special agents; and with Yang Zhizhou as the head, organized special agent armed forces, actively collected guns and weapons, and relied on Banshan Temple in Yangqu County as a base to carry out "guerrilla" activities north to Datong, disrupting our revolutionary order, and vainly attempting to disintegrate our guard troops at an airport, attempting to burn down wood at a station. On the night before the bandit leaders held their second party membership ceremony on August 16 last year, it was cracked by our public security organs.
    The above two cases were concluded after interrogation by the Public Security Department of the Shanxi Provincial People's Government, and a public prosecution was filed to the Provincial People's Court. The Criminal Court of the Provincial People's Court, in accordance with Item 4 of the Instructions on the Suppression of Counter-Revolutionary Activities jointly issued by the State Council of the Central People's Government and the Supreme People's Court, sentenced the bandit leaders Wang Mingxuan and others to death, and executed them by firing squad after approval by the Chairman of the Provincial People's Government.

　　严惩怙恶不悛的反动分子！
    经宽大后仍不悔悟阴谋暴动
    土匪特务重落人民法网
    东北、山西破获巨案四起
    【本报讯】据东北日报消息：沈阳市公安局破获了蒋匪特务地下武装组织所谓“东北志愿兵团”图谋叛乱案。该案匪首蒋匪原十八兵团少将傅国政、蒋匪原东北行辕高级参谋范维坦、蒋匪原五十三军上校副参谋长刘殿武、蒋匪原十八兵团少校科长兼兵团秘书长王养时、蒋匪原五十三军少校侯国升，及蒋匪流散反动军官、警察宋振华、王洪章、何永久、宁文国等均落网。
    自“八一五”解放后，匪首傅国政即在蒋匪保密局东北工作督导室特务领导下收罗惯匪流氓，组织“辽、黑、热、察自卫军”特务武装，并自充“总司令”，大肆敲诈勒索，无恶不作。后为战犯杜聿明编为伪东北保安第九支队少将司令，曾历任匪东北保安长官司令部政工处少将督导专员，伪五十三军骑兵少将团长。沈阳解放后，经人民解放军宽大遣散回籍。但该犯不但不痛改前非，重新作人，反而继续与人民为敌，时刻幻想蒋匪“卷土重来”，乃以经商（养小鸡）为名潜伏沈市活动。
    当美帝国主义侵略朝鲜战争爆发后，少数流散的蒋匪反动高级军官，丑态毕露，他们认为“时机到了”，于是匪首傅国政、范维坦等反动罪魁，便积极网罗蒋匪旧有反动军官，纠集流散残余，计划招募“志愿军与解放军官”，组织所谓“东北志愿兵团”，拟成立两个军十二个团，企图广泛收罗匪徒，以三轮车工人、卖菜小贩等职业为掩护，待时机一到群起武装骚动，以配合美蒋匪帮“卷土重来”，进行叛国扰民的勾当。特别是在美机侵入我国领空，扫射轰炸我安东等地时，该匪帮更疯狂一时，揭破了平时伪装的面目，筹组伪“沈阳市临时警备司令部”，傅国政自命为“司令”，范维坦为“副司令”，妄图重温其残害人民罪恶统治的迷梦。并积极扩展组织，计划掌握交通警察，梦想届时替贼维持秩序，并暗打以我东北人民政府公安部驻地为其办公地点等如意算盘。又准备散发反动标语、布告煽惑扰乱人心，并大量制造散发谣言“鸭绿江桥炸了，国民党把沈阳主席已派好了”，“今天我们望着，将来我们就好了”等等谰言蛊惑人心。
    这些蒋匪流散少数反动军官，习惯于残害人民、扰害国家的勾当，反动成性，时时刻刻企图复辟。但，我人民的公安人员，早已洞烛其奸，匪特们的狼毒祸心，都难逃人民的法网。匪特傅国政等罪恶昭彰，现人民公安机关、人民法院，正准备依法予以严厉的镇压。
    【又讯】长春、辽西两地公安机关，已联合破获蒋匪国防部保密局“东北敌后人民自卫总队第一大队”之庞大的地下武装匪特叛乱案（案情已于本报七月二十九日三版作详细报道），现全案已经审讯完竣，长春市人民法院已分别依法一一判处，并经吉林省政府主席批准。计将该案匪首大队长匪特魏连成（惯匪头子，国民党特务“辽北流动组长”），副大队长匪特陈忱（国民党建军、惯匪头子），参谋长匪特刘德惠（伪警察署长、国民党保安大队长）及主犯匪特越狱主谋逃犯，惯匪韩凤五，匪特土匪头子、国民党清剿大队长罗致昌，匪特军统突击队、清剿中队长、惯匪头子李树森，匪特军统突击队、惯匪头子葛臣，匪特惯匪头子、军统特务武装大队长王福，匪特惯匪头子、军统突击队纪万江，匪特惯匪头子高生，匪特国民党建军连长、惯匪流氓祁江，匪特清剿队张合及勾结匪特为匪窝枪不报的陈和思等十三名，依法判处死刑，同时执行枪决。次要匪特及窝匪窝枪不报之赵奎福、孙发等，分别判处十年以下三年以上有期徒刑，并褫夺公民权。其他胁从分子教育后释放。
    该案匪特成份，均系惯匪、蒋匪特务、流散官兵、流氓及少数反动地主，过去为蒋美匪帮最坚决的爪牙，袭击我区村政府，杀害我干部群众，骚扰我边缘地区，抢劫人民粮食财物，作恶多端，为人民所切齿痛恨，危害社会治安。在我东北全部解放后，蒋匪特务又祸心不死，积极网罗残部，纠集余孽，组织所谓“敌后游击”，进行抢劫破坏，杀人越货，不遗余力，梦想“卷土重来”。这些败类个个恶贯满盈，血债累累，今天受到人民严厉的惩罚，是他们历史的必然归宿。
    【本报太原讯】山西省人民法院于八月五日判决组织地下武装阴谋叛乱之匪特王明轩、曹玉贵、李怀真及杨致洲两案匪首四人死刑。
    王明轩、曹玉贵、李怀真三犯，均出身阎匪军官，一贯仇视人民。太原解放后被俘，经管押教育后即行释放，令其回籍生产。该犯等复在一九四九年七月，秘密组织“大同社会党”，积极进行反革命活动。九月，组织“护国讨逆军山西复省兵团晋南纵队”，由王逆明轩任司令，曹逆玉贵、李逆怀真任副司令；并在晋南地区虚设了四个旅及十九个县支队的番号，勾结惯匪，笼络阎匪流散官兵、反动地主，进行破坏。后经我公安机关严密侦缉，即将匪徒一百二十八人逮捕，并搜出手枪三支、炸药八包、子弹四十八粒、伪国防部任职令、工作证等反动证件多种。
    杨逆致洲曾历任阎匪营长、参谋等职，太原解放时被俘，释放后仍无悔过之意，秘密组织“人民正义党”，积极勾结原阎匪军官及特务分子；并以杨逆致洲为首，组织特务武装，积极收集枪枝武器，以阳曲县班山寺为依托，北向大同进行“游击”活动，破坏我革命秩序，并妄想瓦解我某机场守卫部队，企图烧毁某兵站木料。去年八月十六日于匪首举行第二次入党仪式前夜，为我公安机关破获。
    上述两案经山西省人民政府公安厅侦讯终结，即向省人民法院提起公诉。省人民法院刑事法庭，根据中央人民政府政务院、最高人民法院会衔发布之关于镇压反革命活动的指示第四项规定，将匪首王明轩等四人判处死刑，经该省人民政府主席批准执行枪决。
