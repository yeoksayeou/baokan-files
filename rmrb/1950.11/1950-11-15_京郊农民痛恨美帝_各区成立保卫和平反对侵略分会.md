Farmers in the Suburbs of Beijing Bitterly Hate the American Empire
Branches of the Association to Defend Peace and Oppose Aggression Established in Various Districts

[Our Newspaper] Farmers in the suburbs of the capital have unanimously shouted the slogan "Resist America, Aid Korea, and Defend Our Homes and Country." They are actively volunteering to join the volunteer army, quickly handing over public grain, handing over good grain, and taking other practical actions to oppose American imperialist aggression. The Beijing Agricultural Association convened a current affairs symposium on the 5th, gathering directors of agricultural associations from various suburban districts. At the meeting, a heated discussion was held on the current situation in Korea and the "Joint Declaration of Democratic Parties." Everyone expressed immense hatred for the American imperialists'瘋狂狂 crimes of侵略侵略侵略侵略 invading Korea and Taiwan, and intruding into our airspace and territorial waters. They unanimously supported the Joint Declaration of Democratic Parties and pledged to support the Korean people in resisting American imperialism with practical actions. Chai Zemin, director of the Municipal Agricultural Association, called on the 400,000 farmers in the suburbs to step up production, support Korea, defend their hometowns, and be willing to dedicate everything to the motherland.

Branches of the Committee to Defend World Peace and Oppose American Aggression were established in various districts of the Beijing suburbs on the 6th. At a current affairs symposium for cadres in northern suburbs, the sentiment of resisting America and aiding Korea was exceptionally high, with 45 people signing up on the spot to join the volunteer army and go to the front lines in Korea. Many farmers in various districts signed up to join the volunteer army or carry stretchers.

A patriotic upsurge in grain delivery has been set off in various villages. The Fifteenth District had already completed more than half of the total quota of over 1.3 million jin of corn within three days of the start of the requisition. The four villages of Liuniangfu, Sanjiadian, Lugu, and Moshikou in this district have all completed the work of putting grain into storage. Baofusi Village in the Thirteenth District had nearly completed its entire village's grain quota by the 7th. The quality is mostly grade A.

Rural youth league members in the suburbs are filled with unparalleled hatred for the American imperialists' bandit-like behavior of expanding aggression. The Youth League branch in Madian Village in the northern suburbs recently held a current affairs symposium. When everyone recalled the barbaric acts of the American devils in China in the past, everyone's hearts burned with flames of anger. Ma Zhensheng said: "Their jeeps deliberately crashed into you, killing countless people." Female league member Zhang Shuqin personally witnessed women raped by Japanese devils and workers thrown into mass graves. She said bitterly: "American devils and Japanese devils taste the same when boiled in a pot!" Many male league members expressed their intention to join the volunteer army. Female league member Zhang Shufang said: "If you can go to Korea to fight, we can be Guo Junqing!"

　　京郊农民痛恨美帝
　  各区成立保卫和平反对侵略分会
    【本报讯】首都郊区农民一致喊出了抗美援朝保家卫国的呼声。他们纷纷志愿参加志愿部队、快缴公粮、缴好粮等各种实际行动来反对美帝侵略。北京市农会于五日召集各郊区农会主任举行时事座谈会。会上，对目前朝鲜局势及“各民主党派联合宣言”展开热烈讨论。大家对美帝侵略朝鲜、台湾，侵入我领空、领海的疯狂罪行，无比痛恨，一致拥护各民主党派联合宣言，并要以实际行动，支援朝鲜人民抗击美帝。市农会主任柴泽民号召郊区四十万农民要加紧生产，支援朝鲜，保卫家乡，为祖国不惜献出一切。
    京郊各区于六日分别成立保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会分会。北郊机关干部时事座谈会上，抗美援朝情绪异常高涨，当场有四十五人报名参加志愿军，要到朝鲜最前线去。各区农民很多人都报名参加志愿军或去抬担架。
    各村均已掀起爱国主义的缴粮热潮。十五区在开征后三天，即已完成总数玉米一百三十余万斤的半数以上。该区刘娘府、三家店、鲁谷、模式口等四村已全部完成入仓工作。十三区保福寺村截至七日已接近完成全村应缴公粮额。质量多是甲等。
    郊区农村青年团员对美帝扩大侵略的强盗行为，更充满了无比的憎恨。北郊马店村团支部日前召开了时事座谈会。当大家回忆起美国鬼子过去在中国的野蛮行为，每个人内心都燃烧着愤怒的火焰。马振生说：“他们的吉普车专往你身边撞，轧死了不知多少人。”女团员张淑琴亲眼见过被日本鬼子强奸的妇女，和扔到万人坑去的工人，她恨恨地说：“美国鬼子和日本鬼子熬在锅里一个味！”很多男团员表示要去参加志愿军。女团员张淑芳说：“你们能到朝鲜参战去，我们也能当郭俊卿！”
