This struggle will make a great contribution to the world peace movement."
    Xuan Zhengmin, Chairman of the Central Committee of the North Korean Democratic Youth League, said: "The voice of the 475 million Chinese people has greatly encouraged us. The arrival of the Chinese People's Volunteers has increased the courage and confidence of Korean youth a thousandfold. Our unity has already enabled us to achieve great results on the battlefield, and this result will be further expanded. The glorious victory will surely belong to the people of our two countries, Korea and China."
