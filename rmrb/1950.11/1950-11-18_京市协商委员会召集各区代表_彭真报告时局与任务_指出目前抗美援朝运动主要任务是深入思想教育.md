[Beijing News Agency] The second session of the People's Representatives Conference of All Circles in each district of Beijing Municipality is about to be held successively. In order to enable the people of all districts to understand the current situation and the main tasks of this district representatives' conference, the Beijing Municipal People's Representatives Conference Consultative Committee specially convened district representatives from the nine districts of the city at 2:00 p.m. on the 16th to hear a report by Peng Zhen, Chairman of the Municipal Consultative Committee. Approximately 1,200 people attended.

After a detailed analysis of the current situation, Chairman Peng Zhen said: The movement to Resist America, Aid Korea, and Defend the Homeland has been widely launched in Beijing. The main task of this movement is to make compatriots realize that American imperialism is the deadly enemy of the Chinese people, oppose American imperialist aggression, eliminate the pro-American, worship-American, and fear-American thoughts and psychology existing in some citizens, and universally deepen hatred, contempt, and disdain for American imperialism. Encourage the masses to carry out various volunteer activities.

Regarding the main tasks of this district People's Representatives Conference, Chairman Peng Zhen pointed out three points: First, collect and discuss the opinions of citizens on residents' welfare issues, and help the municipal government formulate a more practical and feasible municipal construction plan for the coming year. Second, continue to review the work and work style of the district offices with the spirit of criticism and self-criticism. Third, discuss strengthening the suppression of counter-revolutionary work and further consolidate the revolutionary order of the capital. It is necessary to make all citizens understand that special agents and bandits are harmful to our people, and everyone should participate in the work of suppressing counter-revolutionary activities.

    【京市新闻处讯】北京市各城区第二次各界人民代表会议即将相继召开。为使各区人民了解目前时局与本次区代表会议的主要任务，北京市各界人民代表会议协商委员会特于十六日下午二时，召集城区九个区的区代表开会，请市协商委员会彭真主席作报告。到会的约有一千二百人。
    彭真主席对目前时局作了详细的分析之后，说：抗美援朝保家卫国的运动在北京市已经广泛的展开了。目前这个运动的主要任务，是要使同胞们认清美帝国主义是中国人民的死敌，反对美帝侵略，消灭一部分市民中所存在的亲美、崇美和恐美的思想和心理，普遍加深对美帝国主义的仇视、鄙视和蔑视。鼓励群众进行各项志愿活动。
    对于本次区各界人民代表会议的主要任务，彭真主席指出三点：第一、搜集与讨论市民对居民福利问题的意见，帮助市政府拟订更切实可行的明年度的市政建设计划。第二、继续以批评与自我批评的精神，检讨区公所的工作与干部作风；第三、讨论加强镇压反革命工作，进一步巩固首都革命秩序。要使全体市民明了：特务、土匪是为害我们人民的，大家来做镇压反革命活动的工作。
