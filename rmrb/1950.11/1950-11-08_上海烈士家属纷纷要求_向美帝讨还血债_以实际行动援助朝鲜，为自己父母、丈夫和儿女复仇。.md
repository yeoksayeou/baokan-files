Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 5th -- Martyrs' families in Shanghai, who have suffered under American imperialism and Chiang Kai-shek's gangs, unanimously cry out for revenge for their parents, husbands, and children. They demand practical actions to actively aid the Korean people, defend our own motherland, and demand the repayment of blood debts from American imperialism.

　　Xin Yuying, the widow of Wang Xiaohe, an outstanding Chinese Communist Party member and worker at the Shanghai Electric Power Company who was brutally murdered by the American imperialist lackey Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang in 1948, said: "The day for revenge has arrived! We patriotic people should mobilize, take practical actions to aid the Korean people, defeat the American aggressors, and defend our motherland!"

　　Zang Haicheng, the younger brother of Zang Dayaozi, a rickshaw puller who was beaten to death by American sailors in 1946, said: "American imperialism has always hated us Chinese people, so their troops, as soon as they set foot on Chinese soil, acted lawlessly and killed people at the slightest provocation. My brother's death is ironclad proof. Now that the people are in charge in China, we cannot allow American imperialism to murder so crazily within our borders and in neighboring brotherly countries. We Chinese people must overthrow it. Every Chinese person should stand with the Korean people, and everyone should put forth their strength to overthrow American imperialism, this murderous bandit."

　　Gao Shaoshan, the widow of Liang Renda, a martyr and employee of Shanghai Yong'an Company who was beaten to death by American imperialist lackey Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang secret agents in 1947 for actively participating in the boycott of American goods, said: "Although I cannot personally go to the front lines, I will certainly step up production in the factory and actively support the soldiers defending the motherland to demand repayment of this blood debt."

　　Citizens who were injured by American-Chiang airplanes and the families of citizens who were killed by them also burn with the fire of revenge. Qiao Agou, a worker at Qiao Yongxing Iron Shop on Xieqiao Road, had his right leg blown off by an American-Chiang bandit plane on February 6th of this year, but he still stubbornly continues to work hard in front of the iron furnace. He said: "In the past six months, the American-Chiang bandit planes have caused me too much pain. When I think of myself and then think of the indiscriminate bombing and atrocities of American imperialism in Korea and our Northeast, it arouses even greater anger in me towards American imperialism. We must immediately aid Korea; the brutality of American imperialism cannot scare us." Liu Mingjiu, a resident of the Nanshi district, said: "My parents, wife, and children were all killed by American planes, and my house and everything I owned were destroyed by American planes. I will never forget this blood debt. We should immediately help the Korean people and drive American imperialism out of Korea. The people of China and Korea should jointly settle the blood debt with American imperialism." Wang Wenhua's wife, a worker at the French Concession Electric Power Company, burst into tears when she mentioned her husband and daughter being killed by American-made bandit planes. Clutching a photo of her husband and daughter, she said sharply: "I want American imperialism to return my husband and return my lovely daughter. I want to bite the American bandits to death." The young Pan Yulong once suffered a nervous breakdown because his newlywed wife was killed by an American plane, but as the flames of aggression burn on the border of the motherland today, he said firmly: "What's the use of pain? Blood debts must be repaid with blood. To defend the motherland, I volunteer to go to Korea to participate in the Korean people's war of resistance against America." Yuan Runde, a worker at the Shanghai Electric Power Company, stroked the large scar on his arm and said angrily: "The American shrapnel cut off this piece of my flesh. My wounds have not yet healed, and American imperialism has invaded our country again. I must recover this blood debt." Fan Jiannan, the manager of Nanshi Jun Chang Hang, whose father and younger sister were killed by American-Chiang bandit planes, said with extreme hatred: "Now I don't need to talk about those sad things in the past anymore, I only know that blood debts must be repaid with blood."

　　上海烈士家属纷纷要求
    向美帝讨还血债
    以实际行动援助朝鲜，为自己父母、丈夫和儿女复仇。
    【新华社上海五日电】住在上海的曾经遭受美帝国主义及蒋匪帮残害的烈士家属们，一致喊出要为自己的父母、丈夫和儿女复仇。他们纷纷要求以实际行动积极援助朝鲜人民，保卫我们自己的祖国，向美帝国主义讨还血债。
    一九四八年惨遭美帝国主义走狗蒋介石匪帮杀害的优秀的中国共产党员、上海电力公司工人王孝和的夫人忻玉瑛说：“现在报仇的日子到了！我们爱国人民，应该动员起来，以实际行动援助朝鲜人民，打垮美国侵略者，保卫我们的祖国！”
    一九四六年被美国水兵活活打死的三轮车工人臧大咬子的胞弟臧海成说：“美帝国主义是一向仇视我们中国人民的，所以他们的军队一踏上中国的地方，就胡作非为，动不动把人打死。我哥哥的死，就是铁证。我们中国现在是人民当了家，不能再允许美帝国主义在我国国境和邻近的兄弟国家内这样疯狂的杀人，我们中国人民一定要打倒它。每一个中国人民应当和朝鲜人民站在一起，大家拿出力量来，打倒美帝国主义这个杀人的强盗。”
    一九四七年因积极参加抵制美国货而被美帝国主义走狗蒋介石匪帮特务打死的上海永安公司职员梁人达烈士的夫人高绍珊说：“我虽然不能亲自上前线，但我一定在工厂里加紧生产，积极支援保卫祖国的战士们来讨还这笔血债。”
    曾被美蒋飞机炸伤的市民和被炸死的市民的家属们也同样燃烧着复仇的怒火。斜桥路乔永兴铁铺的工友乔阿狗，今年二月六日被美蒋匪机炸断一条右腿，但他还坚强地继续在熔铁炉前艰苦地工作着。他说：“这半年来，美蒋匪机给我的痛苦太大了，我想想自己，再想想美帝国主义在朝鲜和我国东北的滥炸暴行，激起了我对美帝国主义更大的愤怒。我们一定要立即援助朝鲜，美帝国主义的残暴是吓不倒我们的。”南市居民刘鸣九说：“我的父母妻儿都是被美国飞机炸死的，我的房屋和一切东西都是被美国飞机炸掉的，这笔血债我永远忘不了。我们应当立刻帮助朝鲜人民，把美帝国主义打出朝鲜去。中朝两国的人民，一齐来向美帝国主义清算血债。”法商电力公司工人王文华的妻子，提起她的丈夫和女儿被美制匪机炸死，她就泣不成声。她紧握着她的丈夫和女儿合拍的照片，厉声地说：“我要美帝国主义还我的丈夫，还我的可爱的女儿，我要用嘴咬死美国强盗。”年青的潘裕龙，曾因新婚的妻子被美机炸死而一度神经失常，但当侵略者的火焰燃烧到祖国边境的今天，他坚定地说：“痛苦有什么用，血债要用血来还，为了保卫祖国，我要志愿到朝鲜去参加朝鲜人民的抗美战争。”上海电力公司工友袁润德抚摸着手膀上的大伤疤，愤恨地说：“削去我这块肉的是美国的弹片。我的伤痕未消，美帝国主义又来侵略我国了。我一定要讨回这笔血债。”被美蒋匪机炸死了父亲、妹妹的南市均昌行经理范建男怀着极度的仇恨说：“现在我用不着再去谈过去那些伤心的事情，我只晓得血债要用血来还。”
