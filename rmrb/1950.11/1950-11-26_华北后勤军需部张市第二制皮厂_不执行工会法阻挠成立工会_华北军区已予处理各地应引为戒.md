The Logistics Department of the North China Military Region’s Zhangjiakou No. 2 Leather Factory:
	Disobeying the Trade Union Law and Obstructing the Establishment of a Trade Union;
	The North China Military Region Has Handled the Matter and All Localities Should Take This as a Warning

[Our Newspaper’s Report] The Zhangjiakou No. 2 Leather Factory of the Logistics Department of the North China Military Region, due to the lack of a working-class viewpoint in its administrative leadership and its failure to implement the Trade Union Law, and its disregard for workers' welfare, has become severely detached from the masses.

The factory has more than 700 workers. In April of this year, the Zhangjiakou Municipal Federation of Trade Unions sent people to the factory to organize a trade union. The workers warmly welcomed this, but the factory leadership first refused unreasonably, then delayed and prevaricated. Later, when they could no longer delay, they reluctantly established a trade union preparatory committee. However, they then adopted repressive measures against the workers. Gao Ao, the head of the factory's general affairs section, openly threatened the workers, saying, "Anyone who joins the trade union will have their job taken away. Anyone who organizes a trade union will be fired!" "Open your eyes, this is a military system!" He also told the trade union cadres, "I don't care about any Trade Union Law promulgated by Chairman Mao. I don't need to organize a trade union here." He even dismissed Chen Guoshun, the director of the trade union preparatory committee, on a pretext. The factory had thirty or so apprentices. Instead of properly organizing them to learn techniques, the leading cadres used them to monitor the workers, wandering around the workshops during the day, and climbing on the windows at night to eavesdrop on who wanted to join the trade union, who was criticizing the leadership, and what things they were reporting to the cadres of the municipal trade union and labor bureau. The workers were angry but afraid to speak out against this extremely bad practice. Everyone felt, "It's not hard to say a word, but what will happen if I lose my job?" In addition, the factory's labor protection and sanitation facilities were extremely poor. The workers had no fixed dormitories, and no effort was made to improve the environment. People slept on the ground and on benches. The pickling room stank, but people were also made to sleep there. The workshops were filled with wool and lime, and no masks were provided. The food management was very poor. The toilets were right next to the kitchen, and flies flew back and forth between the toilets and the kitchen. In May, half of the factory's workers suffered from eye diseases. In the first half of August, more than 100 workers suffered from diarrhea. Four people have died of illness in the six months since work began. When workers became seriously ill, they were pushed out of the factory and left to fend for themselves. If they died, no compensation was paid in accordance with labor protection regulations. The workers had publicly criticized the above problems in newspaper articles, but the leading cadres not only did not examine themselves, but instead fired the critic.

This serious loss of class standpoint and extremely bad bureaucratic warlordist style has seriously alienated the masses, damaged the honor of the people's army, and caused great losses to the cause of the Party and the people. The main reason is that the leading cadres of the factory have no concept of relying on the working class in their thinking, and therefore mistakenly pit the trade union against production work. Gao Ao, the head of the general affairs section, often treated the trade union rudely, saying, "We didn't have this trade union stuff in the past, and we still completed our tasks." Factory director Li Huaxuan believed that the tasks were arduous and that establishing a trade union would be troublesome. Furthermore, the leaders of the Logistics Department of the Military Region were negligent in giving instructions and education in these areas when assigning these comrades to work, which is also a shortcoming.

In view of the fact that similar situations exist to varying degrees in factories in the military system, the North China Military Region, in addition to agreeing with the opinions of the Disciplinary Inspection Committee of the Logistics Department, has removed Gao Ao from his post and criticized Li Huaxuan. It also requires the factories of the military system to take this incident as a warning, so as to clearly establish the viewpoint of relying on the working class, strengthen the policy education and study of factory leading cadres, improve leadership methods and style, unreservedly implement the Trade Union Law, and conscientiously realize the democratization of factory management.

　　华北后勤军需部张市第二制皮厂
    不执行工会法阻挠成立工会
    华北军区已予处理各地应引为戒
    【本报讯】华北军区后勤军需部张家口第二制皮厂，由于行政领导上缺乏依靠工人阶级观点，不执行工会法，漠视工人福利问题，致严重地脱离了群众。
    该厂有工人七百多名，今年四月，张市总工会派人到该厂组织工会，工人热烈欢迎，而该厂领导上先则无理拒绝，继又拖延应付，后来实在拖不下去，勉强成立了工会筹委会。但其后竟对工人采取压制手段，该厂工务股长高鏖公开威吓工人说：“谁要是入工会，就下谁的工，谁组织工会，叫谁滚蛋！”“你们把眼睛睁开吧，这是军事系统！”又对工会干部说：“我不管毛主席公布的什么工会法，我这里不需要组织工会。”并竟把工会筹委会主任陈国顺借故开除。该厂有三十来个学徒，领导干部不好好组织他们学习技术，反而利用他们监视工人，白天在工房乱串，夜间爬在窗户上偷听谁要参加工会，谁在批评领导，谁向市工会、劳动局的干部反映些什么事等。工人对这种极端恶劣的做法，敢怒而不敢言，大家感觉：“说句话不难，饭碗砸了怎办？”此外，厂里劳动保护和卫生设备极坏。工人没有固定宿舍，又不设法改善环境。地上和案上都睡的是人，泡皮房臭气极重，也叫睡人。工房里飞满着羊毛和白灰，也不给口罩。伙食管理很坏。厕所就在伙房旁边，苍蝇就在厕所和伙房来回飞。该厂五月份有半数工人闹眼病。八月上半月，有一百多工人闹肚子。开工半年以来病死了四个人。工人病重了就推出厂子不管，死亡了不按劳保条例予以抚恤。以上问题，工人曾投稿在报纸上公开批评，但领导干部竟不加检讨，反而将该批评者开除。
    这种严重丧失阶级立场和极端恶劣的官僚主义军伐主义作风，严重地脱离了群众，伤害了人民军队的荣誉，给党和人民的事业造成很大损失。主要原因是该厂领导干部思想上毫无依靠工人阶级的观点，因而错误地把工会与生产工作对立起来。工务股长高鏖经常蛮横对待工会，说：“过去没有工会这一套，一样完成任务。”厂长李华轩认为任务繁迫，成立了工会怕麻烦。而军区后勤军需部的领导上，在分配这些同志去工作的时候，事先疏于在这些方面给以指示和教育，也是有缺点的。
    鉴于类似情况在部队系统工厂中或多或少地存在着，华北军区除同意后勤军需部纪律检查委员会意见，将高鏖撤职，对李华轩批评外，并要求军队系统的工厂将此事件引为鉴戒，从而明确树立依靠工人阶级观点，加强工厂领导干部的政策教育学习，改进领导方法与作风，毫无保留地贯彻执行工会法，认真实现工厂管理民主化。
