US-British Imperialists' Atrocities Against Black People
    Di Yuancang
    US-British imperialists have openly embarked on the road of aggressive war. The people of Eastern countries that have been invaded have personally felt the extent of the barbarity and cruelty of the imperialists' actions. These barbaric and cruel atrocities are not only limited to their foreign countries, but also occur frequently in their own countries. The primary target of these atrocities is the Black people. In order to undermine the unity of the working people of all ethnic groups, imperialists intentionally promote the concept of racial discrimination. This barbaric and backward concept is particularly prevalent among the gangster society in the United States. Black people are often subjected to lynching, torture, and murder for trivial incidents, and the US judicial authorities routinely handle these cases by letting them drop. Therefore, the hypocritical face of the imperialists has long been exposed, even in their own countries.

    The Black people of America were originally abducted from Africa by the ancestors of Wall Street and London capitalists. Those white pirates, with handcuffs and shackles, locked up the Black prisoners on ships, transported them back to their home countries, and sold them as slaves at high prices, thereby obtaining huge profits and accumulating capital. The big landlords and capitalists who bought these Black slaves forced them to work like cattle and horses all day long, exploiting them with extreme cruelty. They fattened themselves on the blood and sweat of the Black people. The bones of Black people piled up, and the wealth of white people accumulated into mountains.

    As everyone knows, the emancipation of slaves movement advocated by Lincoln won a victory during the Civil War. However, American-style hypocritical "democracy" has always been manipulated by big capitalists. Black people still do not enjoy equal political status and cannot escape the fate of slavery. Today, the several million Black people in the United States are either doing hard labor like cattle and horses in mines and plantations or wandering around doing odd jobs. The state of mind of Black people is very painful. Here is a song often sung by Black people.

    By the banks of the Swanee River,
    Far, far away,
    My heart is always thinking of it,
    Thinking of my old folks.
    From the ends of the earth to the corners of the sea,
    I wander sadly everywhere.
    I long for my old home in the past,
    Longing for my fellow villagers.
    Wherever I have wandered,
    It is so miserable and bitter,
    Ah, Black people,
    My hope is getting slimmer and slimmer,
    The road back to my old home is getting longer and longer.
    …

    Under the cruel exploitation of white capitalists, the miserable life of Black people is conceivable. In recent years, due to the wave of economic panic, various industrial sectors in the United States have intensified their efforts to exclude Black workers. Hunger especially often threatens Black people. The low level of life of Black people in the United States today can be demonstrated by one situation: the annual living expenses of a Black family of eight by the Mississippi River are not enough for a New York capitalist to smoke cigars for a week. Black people not only have no rights in politics, but also no basic freedom in life. Black people cannot go to white people's restaurants to eat, cannot go to white people's hospitals to see a doctor, and cannot go to white people's schools to study. When watching a play in the theater, white people and Black people cannot sit together. Black people who go to swimming pools where white people are swimming will be beaten. On trams, the seats for white people and Black people are also separated by boundaries. In Pismo Beach, a Black man crossed the "line" by a few inches on a tram, and the tram driver beat him up. As a result, the police arrested and killed the Black man instead. In some cities, the Ku Klux Klan, a gangster organization, frequently uses lynching on Black people, arbitrarily shooting and killing them. The reactionary American newspapers routinely express no surprise at these crimes.

    Black people in British colonies are also suffering from cruel oppression. In the Union of South Africa, there are about ten million people. Among them, more than seven million Black people and Indians are enslaved. They have no political rights. The reactionary constitution stipulates that out of the 150 members of parliament, native Black people and Indians have a total of only six members, and the elected representatives must also be white people. On buses and trains, the seats for white people and non-white people are also separate. In parks, good seats are designated for white people. Post offices have special counters specifically for non-white people. Nearly sixty laws in the Union of South Africa restrict the freedom of movement of non-white people.

    The concept of racial discrimination is based on the capitalist social foundation of man exploiting man. This concept completely violates Article 55 of the United Nations Charter regarding universal observance of and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all. The prevalence of this erroneous view is sufficient to promote imperialism and fascism's external aggression.

    In the socialist Soviet Union, there is absolutely no concept of racial discrimination. Soviet scientists have proven that Black people and white people have equal intelligence. The Soviet people respect all people of color. Black singing king Robeson was obstructed and beaten by thugs several times when he performed in the United States, but he was warmly welcomed everywhere in the Soviet Union.

    Our people have suffered from the oppression of imperialism for a hundred years and have always firmly opposed the racial discrimination concept of imperialists. At the same time, we deeply sympathize with the struggle of all humiliated and harmed Black people for racial equality. Chairman Mao's reply to Meer and Singh, joint secretaries of the South African Indian Congress in Durban, Union of South Africa, fully represents the righteous voice of the Chinese people.

    Under the heavy oppression, the demands of Black people in the United States and Africa for liberation are rising. They are increasingly aware that their own struggle for liberation is inseparable from the struggle of the people of the world for peace. In the current large-scale world peace movement, Black peace fighters such as Robeson have already stood at the forefront.

　　美英帝国主义者压迫黑人的暴行
    狄源沧
    美英帝国主义者公开地走上了侵略战争的道路。东方被侵略国家的人民已经切身感觉到帝国主义者的行为野蛮凶残到怎样的程度。这些野蛮凶残的暴行其实不仅限于他们的国外，即便在他们的国内也是经常发生的。首先作为暴行对象的就是黑人。帝国主义者为了破坏各族劳动人民的团结，有意地提倡种族歧视的观念。在美国流氓社会中间，这种野蛮落后的观念尤其显得普遍。黑人往往为了极小的事故遭受私刑拷打和杀害，而美国司法当局对于这些案件的处理照例是以不了了之。因此帝国主义者的假仁假义的面目即便在他们国内也早已拆穿了。
    美国的黑人是华尔街和伦敦资本家的老祖宗们早先从非洲一带掳掠来的。那些白种的海盗，用手铐脚镣把黑人俘虏锁在船上，运回本国，作为奴隶高价出卖，从而获取暴利，积累资本。收买这些黑奴的大地主和资本家，则强迫黑奴们牛马一般终日操作，极尽残酷地加以剥削。他们靠黑人的血汗养肥自己。黑人的白骨成堆，白人的财富也就积累成山了。
    大家知道，林肯所倡导的解放黑奴运动，曾在南北战争期间得到了胜利。但是美国式虚伪的“民主政治”始终操纵在大资本家手里。黑人至今仍然享受不到政治上的平等地位，摆脱不了奴隶生活的命运。现在美国一千几百万黑人不是在矿场上田庄上做着牛马一样的苦工，就是流浪各地，做着零工。黑人的心境是十分痛苦的。这儿就是黑人们爱唱的一支歌曲。
    斯温尼河的岸边，
    那老远老远的地方，
    我的心老是怀念着它，
    怀念着我的老乡们。
    从天涯到海角，
    我凄凉地到处流浪。
    我怀念着昔日的故乡，
    怀念着我的乡亲。
    在我流浪过的地方，
    都是那样的悲惨和酸辛，
    啊，黑人们，
    我的希望越来越渺茫，
    我离老家的路越来越长。
    ……
    在白种资本家的残酷剥削下，黑人生活的惨苦是可想而知的。近年来，由于经济恐慌的浪潮，美国各产业部门加紧排挤着黑人劳动者。饥饿尤其经常威胁着黑人。目前美国黑人生活水平怎样的低下，可以用一种情况来证明：密西西比河畔黑人八口之家一年的生活费，就不够纽约资本家抽一星期的雪茄烟。黑人不但在政治上没有一切权利，连生活上也没有基本的自由。黑人不能到白人的饭馆去吃饭，不能到白人的医院去看病，不能到白人的学校里去念书。在戏院里看戏，白人和黑人不能坐在一起看。黑人到白人正在游泳的游泳池，就要遭受到殴打。在电车上白人和黑人的座位也分着界线。皮斯莫尔城有一个黑人在电车内跨过了“界线”几英寸，电车驾驶员就把他打伤了。结果是警察反而把这黑人抓去弄死。若干城市的流氓组织三Ｋ党经常猖狂地对黑人用着私刑，随意枪杀着黑人。美国反动报纸对于这些罪行，照例是表示不足惊奇的态度的。
    英国殖民地的黑人，也正受着残酷的压迫。南非联邦有一千万左右人口。其中七百多万黑种人和印度人受着奴役。他们在政治上毫无权利。反动的宪法规定在议会的一百五十名议员中，土著黑人和印度人一共只有六名议员，而且选出来的代表还必须是白种人。公共汽车上和火车上，白种人和非白种人的座位也是分开的，在公园里好的坐椅是指定给白种人坐的。邮局里则有专为非白种人而设的特别柜台。南非联邦近六十种法律限制了非白种人的行动自由。
    种族歧视的观念建立于资本主义人剥削人的社会基础之上。这种观念完全违反联合国宪章第五十五条关于普遍遵守与尊重全体人类之人权及基本自由的规定。这种错误观点的流行是足以助长帝国主义和法西斯主义的对外侵略的。
    在社会主义苏联，完全没有种族歧视的观点存在。苏联科学家证明黑人和白人具有同等的智慧。苏联人民尊重一切有色人种。黑人歌王罗伯逊在美国演唱时几次受了暴徒的阻挠和殴打，他在苏联可就到处受到了热烈的欢迎。
    我国人民身受百年来帝国主义的压迫，对于帝国主义者的种族歧视观念，一向是坚决反对的，同时对于一切被侮辱与被损害的黑人争取种族平等的斗争则抱着深切的同情。毛主席给南非联邦杜邦城南非印度人大会联合书记梅尔和兴赫的复电，完全代表中国人民正义的呼声。
    美国和非洲的黑人，在惨重的压迫下，争取解放的要求正在高涨着。他们日益感觉到本身争取解放的斗争是和世界人民争取和平的斗争分不开的。在当前世界规模的广大的和平运动中间，黑人的和平斗士如罗伯逊等已经站在最前列了。
