　　Soviet "Literary Gazette" and "Soviet Art" Publish Special Articles
    Mourning the Great Writer George Bernard Shaw
    [Xinhua News Agency dispatch] TASS Moscow, November 4th: The "Literary Gazette" and "Soviet Art" published articles on November 4th mourning the late renowned British playwright George Bernard Shaw.

    Anikst, in an article in "Soviet Art," pointed out that in his plays, Shaw used powerful satire to describe how the British bourgeoisie used hypocritical rhetoric about "civilization" to mask its imperialist policies of plunder. Anikst wrote: Shaw's plays exposing imperialist warmongers are particularly powerful in our era. The article pointed out that Shaw's works proved his great political vision. Twenty years ago, in his play "The Apple Cart," he explained that the British ruling class was completely dependent on American monopoly capital.

    The newspaper emphasized that since the existence of the Soviet Union, Shaw had been a friend of the Soviet Union and remained so until the day he died.

    The "Literary Gazette" provided a detailed analysis of Shaw's creative path. Morozov wrote that familiarity with Russian literature was of great significance to this British playwright. He learned from Tolstoy, he was the first British writer to value Chekhov, and he greatly respected Gorky. The article stated: Shaw was essentially a realist, he believed that there was a force of extraordinary truth in Russian dramatic creation, and he himself admitted to being a student of Russian writers.

    Morozov emphasized the enormous importance of Shaw's literary legacy, writing: "In England, which Shaw described as 'money talks, money publishes, money manipulates everything,' Shaw's best works, amidst the widespread decline and depravity in British art, drama, and literature, have been and will continue to be a resounding call, urging people to seek the path of truth, love for humanity, and hatred for hypocrites, those hypocrites who dream of slaughter behind a smokescreen of pious rhetoric."

    Shaw's works are well known to Soviet readers and theatergoers. His plays "Pygmalion," "Widowers' Houses," "The Devil's Disciple," and others have been staged in Soviet theaters. The performance of "Pygmalion" at the Moscow "Maly Theatre" earned a group of actors the Stalin Prize.

    The "Literary Gazette" said: All of Shaw's truly important, lofty, and authentic works are highly valued in the Soviet Union. The news of the death of this great writer, whom Gorky called "one of the bravest thinkers in Europe" at the peak of his creative endeavors, caused sincere grief in the Soviet Union.

　　苏联《文学报》、《苏维埃艺术》刊载专文
    悼念伟大文豪萧伯纳
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科四日电：《文学报》和《苏维埃艺术》于十一月四日刊登了悼念已故著名的英国剧作家萧伯纳的文章。
    安尼克斯特在《苏维埃艺术》上撰文指出：萧伯纳在他的剧本中以强有力的讽刺描述英国资产阶级怎样以关于“文明”的虚伪的词藻来文饰其以掠夺为能事的帝国主义政策。安尼克斯特写道：萧伯纳揭露帝国主义战争贩子的戏剧在我们这个时代特别有力量。该文指出：萧伯纳的著作证明了他的伟大的政治眼光。二十年前，他曾在他的《苹果车》一剧中说明英国统治集团是完全依赖美国垄断资本的。
    该报强调说：自苏联存在之日起，萧伯纳就是苏联的朋友并且直到他逝世的一天始终如一。
    《文学报》对萧伯纳的创作的道路作了详密的分析。摩罗佐夫著文指出：熟悉俄国文学，对这位英国剧作家有重大的意义。他曾向托尔斯泰学习，他是第一个重视柴霍甫的英国作家，他极为敬重高尔基。该文称：萧伯纳在本质上是一个现实主义者，他认为俄国戏剧创作中有超群的真理的力量，并且自己承认是俄国作家的小学生。
    摩罗佐夫强调萧伯纳的文学遗产的巨大重要性时写道：“在萧伯纳描写为‘金钱在讲话，金钱在出版，金钱操纵着一切’的英国，萧伯纳的最优秀的作品在英国的艺术、戏剧与文学中普遍存在的衰退与堕落中间，过去和将来都是一个响亮的呼号，号召人们去寻求真理的、爱人类与憎恶伪君子的道路，那些伪君子们在虔诚的词藻的烟幕后面梦想着杀人的屠场。”
    萧伯纳的著作是苏联读者与戏剧观众所熟知的。他的剧本《卖花女》、《贫民窟》、《魔鬼的门徒》及其他都已在苏联剧院中上演过。《卖花女》在莫斯科“小剧院”上演曾使参加演出的一群演员荣获斯大林奖金。
    《文学报》说：所有萧伯纳所创作的真正重要、崇高与真实的作品，在苏联都极受重视，这位在其创作的努力登峰造极之时被高尔基称为“欧洲最勇敢的思想家之一”的伟大作家逝世的消息，在苏联引起了真诚的悲痛。
