　　The First Battle to Advance into Tibet
    Record of the Southwest Military Region's Engineering Corps' Heroic Construction of the Xin-Gan Trunk Line
    Qian Gong
    One after another, trucks loaded with supplies set off from Xinjin, Sichuan, crossed the Erlang Mountains at an altitude of more than 3,000 meters, and crossed the Zheduo Mountains at an altitude of more than 4,000 meters, heading towards Kangding and Ganzi. The long highway raised a long cloud of dust, shrouding the fields, weeds, and leaves on both sides of the road. The crops were covered with a layer of mud yellow. This tells people that the Chinese people are determined to liberate the western territory of the motherland—Tibet, and the Chinese people are using sufficient strength to support the advance into Tibet.
    However, it is not an easy task for thousands of large trucks to travel from the Chengdu Plain to the Kangzang Plateau. On this thousand-kilometer-long, dilapidated trunk line, bridges washed away by floods must be rebuilt, narrow and rugged road surfaces must be widened or renovated, and steep slopes must be reduced in order to safely transport large quantities of supplies westward. This is the first battle to advance into Tibet. However, the People's Liberation Army Southwest Military Region Engineering Corps, who never bowed to difficulties, threw themselves into this glorious and arduous battle, changing the original appearance of the thousand-kilometer trunk line, and batches of supplies were continuously transported to the front.
    "Strive to open the entire line to traffic ahead of schedule, and strive to liberate the Tibetan people as soon as possible" is the resounding slogan put forward by all officers and soldiers of the Southwest Military Region Engineering Corps. In order to realize this slogan, the officers and soldiers are carrying out a heroic struggle against difficulties.
    For more than fifty years, no one has been to Haizi Mountain. Zhugang Mountain is more than twenty miles up and down. Branches and trunks are covered with green moss, and poisonous snakes and insects appear from time to time. When people pass under the trees, leeches fall from the branches onto people's necks. If you stop for a moment, black mosquitoes will cover your face and hands. Soldiers of the First Battalion of a certain engineering regiment cut down trees in such forests all day long to use as bridge materials. Their bodies are covered with scars from being bitten by leeches and black mosquitoes. Sometimes they have to tie ropes around their bodies, with the other end of the rope hanging on another tree, climb over, and cut down trees growing on steep slopes. Every day, they pulled tree trunks, 20 to 25 centimeters thick, 5 to 8 meters long, and weighing 1,000 to 2,000 kilograms, from the top of the mountain to the valley. It often rained on the top of the mountain, and the soldiers' clothes were often soaked.
    The Shaping River, west of Tianquan County, has rapid currents. Soldiers of the Eighth Company of a certain engineering regiment worked in the cold, deep water all day long. Bridges weighing up to 2,000 kilograms were all pulled onto the bridge piers by manpower. Once, the rope broke, and the bridge fell into the river. Squad leader Xue Qide jumped into the water and carried one end of the bridge. The rest of the soldiers followed and jumped in, pulled the heavy bridge up, and finally successfully completed the task of building the Shaping Bridge. The Fifth Squad of the Fifth Company of a certain regiment blasted stone. The hard Qinggang stone was assigned by the higher authorities to be completed by three people per day. The six people in the squad blasted 50 cubic meters in one day, one person doing the work of twenty-five people. The Fifth Squad of the Fourth Company of a certain regiment picked up stones for paving the road. The stones on the river beach were mixed with silt, which was both difficult to pick up and delayed time. The regiment headquarters required six people to pick up one cubic meter. Squad leader Hu Haozhou and soldier Zhang Liang opened a deep ditch upstream of the river and used hydraulic power to wash away the silt, each completing two cubic meters per day, exceeding the task stipulated by the regiment headquarters by twelve times.
    During the road construction period, the soldiers strictly observed mass discipline. When there were no tools, they found ways to solve the problem themselves. When there was no place to live, they built simple barracks themselves. When food was not delivered in time, the soldiers went hungry and built roads. This spirit of hard struggle moved the Han, Tibetan, and Yi people along the way. The lamas of Tagong Temple, seeing that the soldiers had no food, automatically took out butter and zanba. Gonxar Living Buddha of Gonxar Lama Temple in Muya Township, Kangding said: "The People's Liberation Army is really doing things for the people. What the Kuomintang reactionaries failed to do for more than 30 years (referring to road construction), the People's Liberation Army did in less than half a year."
    Under the selfless fighting spirit of the officers and soldiers, this thousand-kilometer-long trunk line was finally opened to traffic ahead of schedule. Those newly built reinforced concrete bridges, set off by the original bamboo-woven cableways, show that our country is leaping forward to modernization at a speed exceeding several centuries.
    It is estimated that from Xinjin to Ganzi, the construction cost of the entire line, if rice were laid from Xinjin to Ganzi, it could be two feet thick. If the officers and soldiers had not tried every means to overcome difficulties, and if there had not been mutual challenges between companies, platoons, and even squads to ensure the early opening of the entire line, the construction time and cost of this trunk line would have been greatly increased. Today, the people of New China are achieving great victories on all fronts with selfless hard work and unparalleled wisdom.
    Let the imperialist elements and their servants tremble before the heroic fighting deeds of the People's Liberation Army! Any conspiracy by imperialism to invade Tibet will eventually be shattered by the iron hammer of the Chinese people, and the bright five-star red flag will eventually be planted high on the Himalayas.

　　进军西藏的第一仗
    记西南军区工兵部队英勇修建新、甘干线
    钳工
    一辆一辆满载着物资的汽车，从四川新津出发，越过海拔三千多公尺的二郎山，越过海拔四千多公尺的折多山，向康定、向甘孜挺进。漫长的公路扬起了漫长的尘雾，尘埃笼罩住公路两旁的田野、杂草、树叶，田禾染上了一层泥黄色。这告诉人们：中国人民决心解放祖国西陲的领土——西藏，中国人民正在用足够的力量支持西藏的进军。
    但是，成千成百的大卡车，要从成都盆地奔向康藏高原，并不是一件容易的事。在这条长达千余公里年久失修的干线上，被大水冲坏的桥梁必须重新建造，窄狭崎岖的路面必须加宽或翻修，陡削的坡度必须改小，大量的物资才能够安全地西进。这是进军西藏的第一仗，然而从来不向困难低头的人民解放军西南军区工兵部队，投进了这一光辉而又艰巨的战斗，使千余公里干线改变了原来的面貌，成批成批的物资源源地运向前方。
    “争取提前全线通车，争取早日解放西藏人民”，这是西南军区工兵部队全体指战员提出的响亮口号。为了实现这一口号，指战员们向困难进行着英勇的斗争。
    海子山，五十多年来没有人上去过。竹岗山，一上一下二十多里。树枝树干长满了绿苔，毒蛇、毒虫不时的出没，人从树下经过，蚂蝗便从树枝上掉到人颈上，只要稍稍停留片刻，墨蚊便钉满了脸和手。工兵某团一营的战士们成天在这样的森林中砍伐充作桥梁的树木。他们的身上留下累累的被蚂蝗、墨蚊咬过的瘢痕。有时他们要将绳索捆住身子，绳索的另一端吊在另一棵树上，攀援过去，砍伐生长在陡坡上的树木。他们每天将粗二十公分到二十五公分、长五公尺到八公尺，重一、二千斤的树料从山头拉到河谷，山头经常下雨，战士们的衣服经常是湿淋淋的。
    天全县以西的沙坪河，水流湍急，工兵某团八连的战士们，有的终日在寒冷的深水中工作，重到两千公斤的桥梁全用人力拉上桥墩。某次，绳索断了，桥梁掉到河中，班长薛其德跳下水去，扛住了桥梁的一端，其余的战士也跟着跳下去，把笨重的桥梁拉了上来，终于顺利地完成修建沙坪大桥的任务。某团五连五班开石方，坚硬的青岗石，上级规定三个人每天完成一方，该班六个人一天内开了五十方，一个人顶二十五个人的工作。某团四连五班拾铺路面的石子，河滩上的石子杂有泥沙，拾起来既费劲，又耽搁时间。团部要求六个人拾一方，该班班长胡好周、战士张良在河的上流，开了一道深沟，利用水力，洗走泥沙，每人每天完成两方，超出团部所规定的任务十二倍。
    修路期间，战士们严格地遵守了群众纪律，没有工具时，自己想办法解决，没有地方住时，自己搭成简陋的营房。粮食没有及时的运到时，战士们便饿着肚子修路，这种坚苦斗争的精神，感动了沿路的汉、藏、彝各族人民。塔公寺的喇嘛，见到战士们没有粮了，便自动的拿出酥油、糌粑来。康定木雅乡贡呷喇嘛寺的贡呷活佛说：“解放军真是替人民办事情，国民党反动派三十多年来没有办到的事（指修路），解放军来了不到半年就办到了。”
    在指战员们忘我的战斗精神下，这一条千余公里长的干线终于提前全线通车。那些新造好的钢筋水泥大桥，衬着原有的竹编成的溜索，可以看出我们的国家正在以超越数个世纪的速度向现代化飞跃前进。
    据估计：从新津到甘孜一段，全线的修建费用，若用大米从新津铺到甘孜，可以铺成二尺厚。如果没有指战员们在困难当中，想尽办法来克服困难，如果没有连与连、排与排一直到班与班的相互挑战，来保证全线的早日通车，这条干线修建的时间和费用便会大大地增加。今天，新中国人民就是这样以忘我的勤劳和无比的智慧，在各条战线上获到巨大的胜利。
    让帝国主义分子和他们的仆从们在人民解放军英勇的战斗事迹前发抖吧！帝国主义侵略西藏的任何阴谋终将被中国人民的铁槌所粉碎，鲜明的五星红旗终将高插在喜马拉雅的山巅上。
