　　Unite Labor for Unified Struggle
    US Progressive Union to Convene National Union Congress
    Calls on All Unions to Rise Up Against Various Reactionary Measures of the Government
    [Xinhua News Agency, November 15th] Electric News Agency, New York, 13th: Ten prominent leaders of the US Progressive Union, which is not affiliated with the CIO or AFL, including Harry Bridges, President of the International Longshore and Warehouse Union; Maurice Travis, Treasurer of the International Union of Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers; and Ben Gold, President of the International Fur and Leather Workers Union, have issued an appeal to all unions, requesting a national union conference to be held in Washington on November 28th, to unite the national labor movement in a unified struggle to confront the new attacks looming ahead by the American war clique. The appeal calls on all unions to unite to abolish the Taft-Hartley (Slave Labor) Act, abolish the McCarran (Police State) Act, oppose wage freezes, advocate price and rent controls, and drive prices back down, and abolish the Magnuson Act, which stipulates the cleansing of progressive elements from the maritime industry.
    The appeal points out: While monopoly capitalists are obtaining excessive profits, "working men and women are suffering because of the serious decline in living standards." The appeal says: "The entire economic burden is being placed on the backs of the workers."
    The appeal says that police state legislation and the Taft-Hartley Act make it easier for employers to undermine unions and prevent the development of struggles demanding wage increases. The McCarran Act even "imposes the concepts of thought control, registration, and concentration camps on workers." The appeal also condemns the upper-level leaders of the AFL and CIO for failing to provide effective leadership during this critical period.
    The appeal has been supported by the recently formed Chicago Labor Unity Committee, composed of progressive unions, representing 70,000 members.

　　团结劳工进行统一斗争
    美进步工会将召开全国工会大会
    号召各工会起来反对政府各种反动措施
    【新华社十五日讯】电通社纽约十三日讯：不属于产联或劳联的美进步工会的十位著名领袖包括码头与仓库工人工会主席布里治、矿山工厂熔炼工人工会司库特拉维斯，及国际皮毛工人工会主席高尔德在内，向一切工会发出呼吁书，要求于十一月二十八日在华盛顿举行全国工会会议，以团结全国劳工运动进行统一的斗争，来对付由于美国战争集团迫在眼前的新攻击。呼吁书要求各工会团结起来以求废止塔夫脱——哈特莱（奴隶劳工）法，废止麦卡伦（警察国家）法，反对冻结工资，主张管制物价和房租，并使物价回跌，废除规定清洗海员进步分子的麦格纳逊法。
    呼吁书指出：正当垄断资本家获得超额利润时，“劳动男女却因为生活水准的严重下降而受苦”。呼吁书说：“全部经济方面的负担正压在工人的背上。”
    呼吁书说，警察国家的立法及塔夫脱——哈特莱法案，便利雇主破坏工会，并阻止要求增加工资的斗争之发展。而麦卡伦法案更“把思想管制、登记及集中营的观念，强加予工人身上”。呼吁书也谴责劳联与产联的上层领袖没有能在这种危急的时期进行有效的领导。
    呼吁书已得到了新近由进步工会组成的芝加哥劳工团结委员会的支持，它代表着七万会员。
