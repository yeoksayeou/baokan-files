Lawbreakers Sabotaging the Autumn Grain Tax Should Be Punished
    Wei Jin

    Recently, in the new liberated areas of Zhejiang, Anhui, Hunan, Hubei, Sichuan, Suiyuan, Jiangxi, Yunnan and other places, during the autumn grain tax collection, it was discovered that a number of special agents, bandits and unlawful landlords were sabotaging the autumn grain tax. Their methods were varied, the main ones being: spreading rumors, plotting to organize armed riots; inciting farmers to "petition the government for tax reduction and exemption"; threatening farmers not to report land acreage truthfully, or falsely reporting population, land acreage, and crop yields, or using farmers' selfish and backward mentality to organize farmers to collectively conceal land; organizing landlords to seize rent and evict tenants, and attacking farmers; deliberately dispersing grain, allowing grain to rot, and leaving paddy fields uncultivated to resist grain collection, and inciting farmers to hand in bad grain or not to hand in grain; sowing discord among farmers, creating internal disputes among farmers, and bribing cadres and farmer activists with money and women in an attempt to evade grain collection. Some of the above sabotage activities were carried out directly by bandits, special agents, and reactionary landlords, while others were carried out by colluding with and buying off hooligans and backward elements in the villages, using various superstitious organizations to carry out sabotage. These sabotage activities by lawbreakers are hindering the progress of the autumn grain tax collection in some areas, and leading cadres in various places should be seriously vigilant!

    Why are these lawbreakers daring to carry out activities sabotaging the autumn grain tax collection? This is because unlawful landlords, under the fair and reasonable burden policy implemented by the People's Government, cannot transfer the burden to the farmers. Recently, they have seen the US imperialists engaging in a frantic war of aggression in Korea and gradually approaching China's gate. They fantasize that the day of "changing the sky" is coming soon, and therefore seize the opportunity to act. At the same time, some of our cadres have a paralyzing mentality, one-sidedly emphasizing the favorable political situation, one-sidedly emphasizing that this year's autumn grain tax collection task is light, the harvest is good, and the work base is stronger than last year. They mistakenly believe that landlords will not resist the autumn grain tax collection and that the autumn grain tax collection can be carried out peacefully, failing to recognize that autumn grain tax collection is a fierce and complex struggle for the landlord class, and therefore neglecting to guard against unlawful landlords. Some cadres, after the rectification campaign, lack a correct understanding of the spirit of opposing bureaucracy and commandism. In their work, they are constrained and dare not boldly and actively rely on the masses to expose and crack down on the sabotage activities of unlawful elements. In addition, some cadres, in order to complete the task quickly, still have a work style of coercion and commandism, doing everything themselves, and being divorced from the masses, giving unlawful elements an opportunity to sow discord between cadres and the masses and sabotage the autumn grain tax collection work.

    Paying agricultural tax is a duty that farmers should fulfill to the country and is also one of the main sources of state revenue. The agricultural tax revenue of the people's country is completely the opposite of the corruption and embezzlement of the Kuomintang reactionary rule. Today's tax revenue is taken from the people and used for the people by the government, for the long-term interests of the people. Therefore, the sabotage of the autumn grain tax collection by lawbreakers is a destruction of the interests of the farmers, which cannot be tolerated and must be stopped immediately and effectively. To this end, first, the paralyzing mentality must be cleared from the minds of the cadres, and it must be recognized that this year's burden policy is fair and reasonable. Although some landlords are willing to abide by the law and pay grain, there are also many of the most reactionary landlords who will inevitably hate the burden policy even more because they cannot transfer the burden to the farmers in the future. We must correctly estimate these two aspects in order to fight against the sabotage activities of unlawful elements in a step-by-step and planned manner. Second, combined with the current situation of the US imperialists expanding the war of aggression, the autumn grain tax collection policy should be repeatedly and thoroughly publicized among the masses, so that the farmers understand that the People's Government's burden is taken from the people and used for the people, and that this year's burden is fairer and more reasonable than last year's, thereby breaking the rumors, deceptions, threats, and other sabotage activities carried out by unlawful elements among the farmers. Third, correctly grasp the policy of "punishing the ringleaders, not questioning the followers, and rewarding those who perform meritorious service," and earnestly mobilize the masses to report and accuse the ringleaders who sabotage the autumn grain tax collection, arrest and try them by the Public Security Bureau and judicial organs, and punish them according to law. It is extremely wrong to be constrained in the face of the enemy's sabotage activities, to be one-sidedly lenient, and not to carry out necessary suppression. Fourth, step up the work of suppressing bandits, organize mass armed forces, and crack down on and eliminate all bandits who dare to sabotage the autumn grain tax collection by force, in order to stabilize people's minds and consolidate rural order.

    In order to ensure the victorious completion of this year's autumn grain tax collection task and strongly support the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea, it is hoped that all localities will be highly vigilant, pay attention to the conspiracy and sabotage activities of unlawful elements at all times and in all places, closely rely on the masses, and carry out a resolute struggle against unlawful elements.

　　不法分子破坏秋征应予惩办
    维进
    最近浙江、安徽、湖南、湖北、四川、绥远、江西、云南等新解放区，在秋征当中，发现若干特务、土匪及不法地主破坏秋征，花样百出，其中最主要的表现是：散布谣言，阴谋组织武装暴动；煽动农民向政府“请愿减免负担”；威胁农民不准实报地亩，或虚报人口、地亩、产量，或利用农民自私落后的心理，组织农民集体瞒田；组织地主夺租夺佃，打击农民；故意分散粮食，霉烂粮食，荒芜稻田，以抵抗征粮，并煽动农民交坏粮、不交粮；在农民内部进行挑拨离间，制造农民内部纠纷，以金钱女色贿赂干部及农民积极分子，企图逃免征粮。上述各种阴谋破坏活动，有的是土匪、特务与反动地主直接出面活动，有的则是勾结与收买村中流氓分子、落后分子出面，利用各种迷信组织进行破坏。不法分子的这些破坏活动，正在若干地区妨碍着秋征工作的进展，各地领导干部应引起严重警惕！
    为什么这些不法分子敢于进行破坏秋征的活动呢？这是因为不法地主在人民政府实行公平合理的负担政策下，不能将负担转嫁于农民，而最近他们看到美帝在朝鲜进行疯狂的侵略战争，并一步步逼近中国的大门，他们妄想“变天”的日子快要到了，因而乘机活动。同时，我们有些干部存在麻痹思想，片面地强调了有利的政治形势，片面地强调了今年秋征任务轻，收成好，工作基础比去年强，错误的认为地主不会抵抗秋征，秋征可以和和平平地进行，没有认识秋征对地主阶级来说是一场激烈的复杂的斗争，因而对不法地主疏于防范。而有些干部则在整风之后，由于对反对官僚主义、命令主义的整风精神缺乏正确的认识，在工作中束手束脚，对于不法分子破坏征粮，采取放任态度，不敢大胆积极的依靠群众，揭发与打击不法分子的破坏活动。另外有些干部则为了迅速完成任务，工作中依然存在强迫命令，包办代替，脱离群众的作风，给不法分子挑拨干群关系、破坏秋征工作以可乘之机。
    缴纳农业税是农民对国家应尽的义务，也是国家财政主要收入之一。人民国家的农业税收，与国民党反动统治时期由贪官污吏中饱私囊完全相反，今天的税收是政府取之于民，又用之于民，是为了人民远大的利益，因此不法分子破坏秋征，就是破坏农民的利益，这是决不能容许的，必须立即有效地加以制止。为此，第一，在干部中必须清除麻痹思想，认识到今年负担政策的公平合理；固然有一部分地主愿意守法纳粮，但也有不少的一部分最反动的地主，却因为今后不能将负担转嫁于农民，必然更加仇视负担政策。必须正确的估计到这两方面，才能有步骤有计划的和不法分子的破坏活动进行斗争。第二，结合目前美帝扩大侵略战争的形势，应在群众中反复深入地进行秋征政策的宣传，使农民明了人民政府的负担是取之于民用之于民，今年的负担比去年更加公平合理，从而打破不法分子在农民中进行的造谣、欺骗、威胁等阴谋破坏活动。第三，正确掌握“首恶者必办，胁从者不问，立功者受奖”的政策，认真发动群众检举告发破坏秋征的首恶分子，由公安局、司法机关逮捕审判，依法惩处。任何在敌人破坏活动面前束手束脚，片面宽大，而不作必要的镇压，都是极端错误的。第四，加紧剿匪工作，组织群众武装，打击与消灭一切敢于武装破坏秋征的匪徒，以安定人心，巩固农村秩序。
    为了今年秋征任务得以胜利完成，有力地支援抗美援朝运动，希望各地以高度警惕，随时随地注意不法分子的阴谋破坏秋征活动，紧紧地依靠群众，与不法分子进行坚决的斗争。
