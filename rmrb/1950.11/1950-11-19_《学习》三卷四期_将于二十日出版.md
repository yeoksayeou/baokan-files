*Study* Magazine, Volume 3, Issue 4, will be published on the 20th of this month. The main contents of this issue include: the "Study Outline on Current Affairs Issues" drafted by the editorial department, which is divided into four parts: 1. What is the purpose of American imperialism in launching aggression against Korea? Why should the Chinese people volunteer to resist America and aid Korea? 2. How does the Chinese people's resistance against America and aid to Korea relate to safeguarding peace? 3. Why is the Korean people's war of resistance against America bound to achieve final victory? 4. How should we correctly understand the United States? To coordinate with the current affairs studies across the country, this issue publishes Wang Huide's "Studying ‘Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism’ to Fundamentally Understand American Imperialism," explaining that American imperialism is the most reactionary, barbaric, and autocratic imperialism in the world today, from the monopolistic, parasitic, decaying, and moribund essence of imperialism. In this issue's "Bi-Weekly Commentary," three articles are published: Shuang Yun's "Overthrow Pro-Americanism," Shi Ren's "This is Something No One Can Oppose," and Mu Zhi's "On Mobilization." Other essays include Jian Bozan's "The Ancient Chinese Feudal Society," Tao Dayong's "The Capitalist Production Process and Economic Crisis – Introducing Chapter 8 of Leontief's ‘Political Economy’," Hu Sheng, Yu Guangyuan, and Wang Huide's "Class Struggle" (Basic Knowledge Lecture Series on Social Sciences, Lecture 4), and Guo Dali's "Capital Export" (Explanation of "Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism," Lecture 4). This issue's "Reader Discussion Forum" continues to discuss the question "How should we help Wang Dingchen carry out ideological remolding?" The "Q&A" column answers a question, "Where does the superiority of our democratic centralism over the 'democratic' political systems of capitalist countries lie?"
