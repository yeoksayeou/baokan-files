　　Xinhua News Agency, North Korea (November 24th) – The Chinese People's Volunteers, in their effort to resist America, aid Korea, protect their homes and defend their country, have entered Korea and are fighting alongside the Korean people against the American imperialist aggressors. This has filled the Korean people with excitement, and a harmonious and seamless international friendship prevails between them. Along the roads, one can see Korean people voluntarily joining the war effort by delivering public grain, acting as guides, and repairing roads. When they see the Chinese People's Volunteers, many shout in broken but enthusiastic and affectionate Chinese: "China! Mao Zedong!" The soldiers respond joyfully with "Korea! Kim Il-sung!" Many more, when mentioning the names of Stalin, Mao Zedong, and Kim Il-sung, raise their thumbs. When speaking of Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee with contempt, they extend their little fingers and repeatedly say, "Die, die!" When the reporter arrived in a certain area of Korea, a miner grabbed wine and insisted on clinking glasses with me, saying, "Let's drink to your help in Korea's independence and unification!" Although I do not drink alcohol, I drank a full glass with him for the sake of the great struggle against our common enemy, which made him smile contentedly. One can often see soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean people talking animatedly together, even though they do not understand each other's language. Although the language is a barrier, the enthusiasm of internationalism is still expressed through facial expressions, tone of voice, and hearty laughter.
　　After marching all night, a certain unit arrived at its campsite before dawn, and the soldiers camped outdoors. An old Korean woman quietly came out and covered the soldiers with a lot of straw. If they themselves had not been without blankets, sleeping in only thin clothes, she would have covered our soldiers with her own blankets. In many units'驻地, the Korean people insisted on killing chickens for the troops to eat. After repeated declinations, the villagers still cooked rice porridge with rice and sent it to the soldiers. The Chinese People's Volunteers' excellent discipline of not violating the interests of the people, even to the slightest degree, is praised everywhere by the Korean people. Wherever the Volunteers go, they help the Korean people with labor, some carrying water, some sweeping yards, some helping to thresh rice and corn, and some helping to dig air-raid shelters. This has further moved the Korean people. When it gets dark, the Korean people light lamps and bring them into the houses for the soldiers; when it is time to eat, people bring over dishes of food. A certain unit broke a pottery jar, and when they left, they compensated with rice. The Korean villagers said, "Ah, take it! Eat your fill and fight the enemy well." After several explanations, they reluctantly accepted. Some villagers secretly slaughtered pigs and sent them to the troops to eat, causing great difficulties for the liaison officers (who spoke both Chinese and Korean and were responsible for translation and communication with the people). After much explanation, they reluctantly went back. The officers and soldiers of the Korean People's Army love the Chinese People's Volunteers like their own brothers. When a certain unit was marching, a car suddenly sped forward from behind the troops. It turned out that there was a fork in the road ahead, and the Korean People's Army personnel had specifically gone ahead to show the way. When a certain unit was marching, they woke up comrades of the Korean People's Army who were sleeping in a house. They didn't have time to put on their clothes properly, but they ran out of the house to shake hands and laugh with the soldiers. One even ran into the middle of the troops, embraced two soldiers with both arms, and spoke enthusiastically, although the soldiers did not understand. He continued to do this for a long distance before returning. Usually, when personnel from the two fraternal forces meet, they first salute each other and then shake hands one by one. The reporter believes that the deep friendship between the Chinese and Korean people will surely guarantee the victory against American imperialism, and will surely further develop and deepen in this common struggle.

　　我志愿部队与朝鲜人民
    互相热爱亲如兄弟
    【新华社朝鲜北部某地二十四日电】中国人民抗美援朝保家卫国志愿部队开入朝鲜，和朝鲜人民共同抗击美帝国主义的侵略，使朝鲜人民异常兴奋，相互之间洋溢着融洽无间的国际友情。公路线上，到处可以看到自愿参战的朝鲜人民在送公粮、作向导、修补道路。当他们看到中国人民志愿部队时，许多人喊着不熟练的但是充满了热情而亲切的中国话：“中国！毛泽东！”战士们同样欢乐地答以“朝鲜！金日成！”更有许多人在说着斯大林、毛泽东、金日成的名字时竖起了大拇指。当用鄙视的表情说到蒋介石、李承晚时则伸着小拇指并连说：“死拉，死拉的。”记者刚到达朝鲜某地时，一个矿工拿了酒一定要和我碰杯，并且说：“为了你们帮助朝鲜独立统一，干一杯吧！”我虽不能饮酒，但为伟大的反对共同敌人的斗争，就和他干了满满的一杯，他才满意地笑了起来。常常可看到中国人民志愿部队的战士和朝鲜人民在一起热烈地说着互相听不懂的话。虽然语言不通，但国际主义的热情依然从面部的表情，语言的腔调和爽朗的笑声中表达出来。
    某部经一夜行军，天未明到达宿营地，战士均在屋外露营。一位朝鲜的老太婆，她悄悄地出来，拿了许多草盖在战士身上。如果不是她们自己也没有被子，只是穿着单薄的衣服睡觉，她一定会把被子也盖在我们战士身上的。许多单位的驻地都发生过朝鲜人民坚持要杀鸡给部队吃，经多次婉谢后，老乡们还是用大米烧了米汤送给战士们喝。中国人民志愿部队秋毫无犯的优良纪律，使朝鲜人民到处赞扬。志愿部队所到之处，纷纷帮助朝鲜人民劳动，有的挑水，有的扫院子，有的帮助打稻子、玉米，也有的帮助挖防空洞。这更感动了朝鲜人民。天黑了，朝鲜人民就把灯点好送到屋里给战士；吃饭时，人们就送过菜去。某部打坏了一个瓦罐，临走时用米赔偿，朝鲜的老乡就说：“哎，你们拿了去吧！吃饱了好打敌人。”经几度解释后，才肯收下。有的老乡偷偷地杀了猪送给部队吃，造成联络员（会说中朝两种语言负责翻译与人民联系事宜）很大的困难。经多方解释，才怏怏地回去。朝鲜人民军指战员见到中国人民志愿部队，更是如亲兄弟般的热爱。某部行军时，忽然有一辆汽车从部队后面飞驶向前。原来前面有一个岔路，朝鲜人民军人员特地赶到前面指路。某部行军时，惊醒了正在屋里睡觉的朝鲜人民军同志，他们来不及穿好衣服，就从屋子里跑出来和战士们握手欢笑。有一个更跑到部队中间，两臂抱着两个战士热烈地讲着话，虽然战士们都不懂，但是他还是要讲。这样一直送出很远才回去。平时两支兄弟部队的人员相遇，总是首先互相行礼，然后一一握手。记者相信中朝两国人民这种深厚的友谊，一定会保证反抗美帝国主义的胜利，并且一定会在这种共同斗争中更加发展加深。
