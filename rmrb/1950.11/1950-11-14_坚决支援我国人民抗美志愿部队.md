　　Resolutely Support the Chinese People's Volunteer Army to Resist America and Aid Korea
　　Willing to Go to Korea to Drive and Support the War to Resist America
Editor:
　　Our locomotive team is determined to support the joint declaration of all democratic parties with practical actions. American imperialism's aggression against Korea seriously threatens the security of our border, shamelessly occupies our Taiwan, and repeatedly invades our airspace with aircraft, killing and wounding our compatriots and railway workers, and even more shamelessly cultivates Japanese fascist forces. This shows that the ambition of American imperialism is not only to occupy our Taiwan and invade Korea, but to invade the whole of China, the whole of Asia, and the whole world. All the crew members of our locomotive team are extremely angry. We Chinese people must not stand idly by and watch our class brothers, the Korean people, being invaded and massacred. Our locomotive team volunteers to go to Korea to help our Korean brothers drive locomotives and directly support the Korean war to resist America. We also volunteer to receive military training and are ready to fight armed at any time. We are determined to fight to the end to aid Korea, eliminate the American aggressors, defend our motherland, and defend the world's lasting peace!

　　To Defend the Motherland, Resolutely Support Korea
Editor:
　　American imperialism's invasion of Korea and its constant dispatch of aircraft to invade our airspace and bomb and strafe our compatriots, I, on behalf of the people of Dongjiagou Village, Yanqing County, Chahar Province, express my protest.
　　The Korean people once fought side by side with our people to fight against the Japanese invaders. Today, the Korean people are suffering such pain, and we must not ignore it. For the survival of the Korean people and to defend the security of the motherland, all the people in our village are determined to support the Korean people's war to resist America with practical actions of working hard and saving food and clothing!

　　Work Hard to Produce More Grain and Encourage Son to Fight Well
Editor:
　　We labor models at the county (Anguo) meeting are extremely angry about the American imperialists invading our northeastern border and American planes bombing our people! We defeated the Japanese devils and overcame the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang supported by the United States. Today, the American imperialists want to directly come and cause trouble for us, destroying our country and world peace. This is not allowed! The labor models unanimously agreed to fight it and use practical actions to produce well, lead the masses to produce more grain to support the Korean People's Army and our volunteer troops. Many labor models also said: "Joining the army is also doing it!" Xu Ruzhen said: "We didn't chicken out when fighting the Japanese, and we won't hesitate to fight the American bandits!" Luo He said: "We will write to our sons who are soldiers and tell them to fight the American soldiers well in the future." Xu Jingfen and Zheng Luo insisted: "We will go back and actively mobilize the masses to hand in public grain quickly and let the masses further understand the significance of paying public grain today." In short, everyone hates American imperialism and is eager to fight it.

　　Learn to Use Modern Weapons as a Backing for the Volunteer Army
Editor:
　　American imperialism launched a war of aggression in Korea and invaded our territory of Taiwan. American military aircraft bombed the Northeast and strafed our beloved compatriots, threatening our security and undermining our construction. American imperialism has repeatedly helped the Kuomintang massacre the Chinese people and already owes us a huge debt of blood. I am a second-class disabled soldier. In the past, when fighting the American imperialist running dog Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, I stabbed seven enemies to death. This time, if American imperialism dares to invade us, I will stab a few more American devils to death. Now I bravely swear: to unite closely with my comrades, learn from them, help them develop revolutionary heroism, learn to use modern weapons, and be a backing for our volunteer troops going to Korea to participate in the war.

　　I Want to Actively Do the Work of Resisting America and Aiding Korea in My Own Post
Editor:
　　I met Chairman Mao in Beijing this time. Along the way, I was welcomed by the Party, the people, various agencies, schools, and other groups, and received the care of the Party and superiors. After returning, I was warmly welcomed by my comrades. I feel very honored. The acquisition of this honor is mainly due to the Party and superiors' training of me, followed by the help of my comrades and my own efforts. My contribution to the people is far from comparable to the national heroes and models, and to the 73-year-old hero Jiang Weiping and the 19-year-old female hero Guo Junqing. This shows that my contribution to the Party and the people is not great. But I have a firm determination: to respond to Chairman Mao's call, to actively lead the masses and myself to complete the task under the leadership of the superiors in any environment, and strive to be a model! Especially when American imperialism is invading Korea and Taiwan, and using aircraft to kill our Chinese people, and burning the flames of war to our border, I myself, and hope that all our comrades, should stand up and effectively support the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, defend the motherland, and defend peace in the Far East. I myself am prepared to do everything in my power, even to shed my last drop of blood, to repay the people of the motherland and to show that I am "always a member of a fighting team"!

　　Enthusiastically Handing in Public Grain and Suppressing Counter-Revolutionary Elements
Editor:
　　After I came back from the meeting in Beijing, I conveyed what Chairman Mao told us at the provincial, county, district, school, and various mass meetings. Everyone knew that they should "strive to build a strong national defense force and a strong economic force." In particular, after all our militiamen comrades listened to my talk about the model deeds of combat hero Comrade Guo Junqing, it gave them a great boost, and they all proposed to step up their study of Comrade Guo's spirit of serving the motherland and the people. Comrade Xu Wancai said: "We must use practical actions to oppose American imperialism's aggression and defend the motherland to earn the model badge worn on our chest." We are now actively cooperating with the masses to carry out threshing and selecting public grain to support the resistance to American imperialism's aggression; at the same time, we are organizing all armed forces, heightening vigilance, and suppressing the sabotage activities of counter-revolutionary elements to combat the aggressive conspiracy of American imperialism.
　　I cannot forget my previous life as a beast of burden, and the taste of not wearing cotton pants for several winters, which was entirely given to us by imperialism and the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang. Only under the leadership of Chairman Mao did we get rid of that impoverished life. Today, American imperialism wants to bully us again, repeatedly using aircraft invading Korea to bomb our Andong and the coastal areas of Shandong, and interfering with our liberation of Taiwan. Its beastly behavior is becoming more and more rampant, and it is openly challenging us, the Chinese people. We resolutely do not agree to it and must use all my strength, not fear life, not fear death, and drive American imperialism back into the sea! We must also actively prepare forces to support the army in liberating Taiwan and Tibet.

专栏：本报各地读者来信

　　坚决支援我国人民抗美志愿部
    愿到朝鲜开车支援抗美战争编辑同志：
    我们机车组坚决要以实际行动拥护各民主党派联合宣言。美国帝国主义侵略朝鲜，严重威胁到我国边境的安全，无耻的吞占了我国台湾，并以飞机一再侵入我领空，杀伤我同胞，杀伤我铁路工友，更无耻的培植日本法西斯武力。这说明了美帝国主义的野心不仅占我台湾，侵略朝鲜，而是要侵略全中国，侵略全亚洲、全世界。我们机车组全体乘务员都万分愤恨。我们中国人民决不能眼看着我们的阶级弟兄朝鲜人民被侵略、被惨杀，而置之不理。我们机车组自愿到朝鲜去，帮助朝鲜弟兄开机车，到前方直接支援朝鲜抗美战争。并且自愿受军事训练，随时准备武装战斗。我们决心为了援助朝鲜，为了消灭美国侵略军，为了保卫我们的祖国，为了保卫全世界持久和平而奋斗到底！
                    毛泽东号机车组全体人员  李永  王清权  张玉海 岳尚武  武海民  贾文彬  郑笃恭  张家祯  朱殿吉
            为了保卫祖国坚决支援朝鲜编辑同志：
    美帝侵略朝鲜又不断派飞机侵犯我国领空，轰炸扫射我国同胞，我谨代表察哈尔省延庆县董家沟全村人民表示抗议。
    朝鲜人民曾和我国人民并肩作战，打击日寇，今天朝鲜人民遭到这样的痛苦，我们决不能置之不理。为了朝鲜人民的生存，为了保卫祖国的安全，我们全村人民决以努力生产，节衣缩食的实际行动支援朝鲜人民的抗美战争！
                                            农业劳模  高万红
            努力生产多打粮食鼓励儿子好好打仗编辑同志：
    俺们在县（安国）里开大会的劳动模范对美帝侵向我国东北边境和美国飞机轰炸我国人民愤恨极了！咱们打败了日本鬼子，又战胜了美国支持的蒋介石匪帮，今天美帝又要直接来和我们捣乱，破坏我国和世界和平，这是不行的！劳模们一致要和它干，要用实际行动好好生产，领导群众多打粮食支援朝鲜人民军和我们的志愿部队。不少劳模并说：参军也干的了！徐如珍说：“打日本咱们可没草鸡了，要打美国强盗更是不含糊！”洛合说：“我们要给当兵的儿子去信，叫他将来好好打美国兵。”徐景芬、郑洛硬说：“我们回去就积极动员群众快交公粮，并让群众进一步了解今天交纳公粮的意义。”总之，大伙对美帝恨透了，都摩拳擦掌地一定要和它干。

        出席河北省劳模徐景芬、郑洛硬、钟香改、陈桂芬及全体劳模
              学习使用现代武器作为志愿部队后盾编辑同志：
    美帝国主义在朝鲜发动侵略战争，并侵略我国领土台湾，美国军用飞机轰炸东北，扫射我国亲爱的同胞，威胁我国的安全，破坏我国的建设，美帝国主义一再帮助国民党残杀中国人民，已经欠下了我们一笔大血债。我是二等残废，过去打美帝走狗蒋匪帮的时候，刺死敌人七名，这次美帝国主义如果敢来侵略我们，我要更多地刺死几个美国鬼子，现在我勇敢宣誓：要和我的战友们紧紧团结在一起，向他们学习，帮助他们开展革命英雄主义，学习使用现代化的武器，作为志愿赴朝参战的我志愿部队的后盾。
                                              战斗英雄  张学智
            我要在自己岗位上积极做抗美援朝工作编辑同志：
    我这次在北京见到了毛主席。沿途又受到了党、人民、各机关、学校等团体的欢迎，受到了党和上级的照顾，回来后又受到同志们的热烈欢迎，我感觉非常荣幸。这种荣誉的获得，主要是由于党、上级对自己的培养，其次就是同志们的帮助以及自己的努力。我对人民的贡献，和全国英雄、模范对比，和七十三岁蒋维平老英雄、十九岁女英雄郭俊卿等同志相比，还相差太远。这说明自己对党、对人民的贡献不大。但是我有坚毅的决心：响应毛主席的号召，在任何环境中都能在上级领导下，积极带起群众和自己一道去完成任务，争取做模范！尤其在美帝国主义侵略朝鲜、台湾，又以飞机杀害我中国人民，把战争的火焰烧向我国边疆的时候，我自己，并希望我们全体同志，要挺起身来，有效地支援朝鲜人民军和中国人民的志愿部队，保卫祖国，保卫远东的和平。我自己并准备尽我一切的力量，以至流尽最后一滴血，来报答祖国人民，和表示我“永远是一个战斗队”队员！
                          部队模范工作者  敖中和（刘庆年代笔）
            踊跃交纳公粮镇压反革命分子编辑同志：
    我从北京开会回来后，把毛主席告诉我们的事情，在省里、县里、区里、学校里及各种群众会上做了传达，都知道了要为“建立强大的国防力量和强大的经济力量而奋斗”。特别是我们全体民兵同志们，听我讲了战斗英雄郭俊卿同志的模范事迹之后，给他们加了很大的劲，都提出要加紧学习郭同志的为祖国为人民的精神。许万才同志说：“要用反对美帝侵略，保卫祖国的实际行动来换取模范牌带在胸前。”我们现在正一面积极配合着群众进行打场和选公粮来支援抵抗美帝侵略；一面组织所有的武装力量，提高警惕，镇压反革命分子的破坏活动，以打击美帝国主义的侵略阴谋。
    我不能忘掉我以前过的牛马生活，和好几个冬天没穿着棉裤的滋味，那完全是帝国主义和国民党反动统治给予我们的。只有在毛主席的领导下，才从那种穷困的生活中摆脱出来。今天美帝国主义又想要欺侮我们，屡次用侵朝的飞机轰炸我国安东及山东沿海，并干涉我们解放台湾。它这种野兽行为一天天猖狂，竟公开的向我们中国人民挑战。我们坚决不答应它，一定要用尽我所有的力量，不贪生，不怕死，把美帝打回海里去！还要积极准备力量，支援大军解放台湾、西藏。
                                民兵英雄  殷国良（贾忠林代笔）
