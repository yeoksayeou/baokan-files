Recommendation of a New Book in Chinese from Moscow
"Trial Materials of Former Japanese Army Servicemen Accused of Preparing and Using Bacteriological Weapons"
    The International Bookstore has recently received several new books in Chinese from Moscow, among which the most worthy of introduction to readers is "Trial Materials of Former Japanese Army Servicemen Accused of Preparing and Using Bacteriological Weapons."
    This book is a complete record of the trial of twelve Japanese germ warfare criminals held in the city of Khabarovsk, USSR, from December 25 to 30, 1949, and is divided into chapters such as "Preliminary Investigation Documents," "Testimonies of Defendants and Witnesses in Court," "Conclusions of the Inspection Committee," "Speech of the State Prosecutor," and "Judgement of the Military Tribunal." It comprises 583 pages. This book not only reflects the great historical significance of this trial, exposing nakedly the crimes of Japanese imperialism in preparing and using extremely cruel weapons that violated humanitarian principles, but also illustrates the unremitting efforts of the Soviet Union in promoting socialist humanitarian thought and opposing the use of weapons that massively eliminate human life. More importantly, this trial proved to the world that all enemies of humanity who use inhuman tools to wage war will ultimately not escape due judgement. The fate of the Japanese war criminals serves as a lesson for the American imperialist aggressors. The righteous tribunal awaits these bloodthirsty savages.

　　推荐莫斯科中文版新书
    “前日本陆军军人因准备和使用细菌武器被控案审判材料”
    国际书店最近又到莫斯科中文版新书多种，其中最值得向读者介绍的是“前日本陆军军人因准备和使用细菌武器被控案审判材料”。
    按这本书为一九四九年十二月二十五日到三十日在苏联伯力城对十二个日本菌细战犯进行审判的全部纪录，内分“预审文件”、“被告和证人在法庭上的供词”、“检验委员会的结论”、“国家公诉人的演词”和“军事法庭判决书”等章。计五八三页。本书不但反映了这次审判具有重大的历史意义，赤裸裸地暴露了日本帝国主义准备和使用违反人道原则的极端残忍的武器的罪行，并且说明了苏联宣扬社会主义人道思想反对使用大批消灭人命的武器的不懈努力，更重要地，这次审判向世界证明，凡是使用惨无人道的工具以进行战争的人类公敌，最后都无法逃脱应得的裁判。日本战犯的结局，足以为美帝国主义侵略者之借镜。正义的审判台在等待着这些嗜杀的生番。
    （推）
