　　Northeast Federation of Trade Unions Production Department Joint Meeting Summarizes Competition Experience
　　Determines to Deepen the Competition Movement with Planning
　　Competition Conditions Must Be Specific and Practical, and Employee Difficulties Must Be Resolved at Any Time

　　[This newspaper's report] According to the Northeast Daily: In order to exchange experiences in the patriotic production competition and further promote the deepening of the movement, the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions held a joint meeting of production department heads of provincial and municipal industrial trade unions from the 15th to the 18th of this month. Dong Xin, the Minister of Production of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, made a special trip to provide guidance. Nine technicians were also invited to attend the meeting as non-voting delegates.

　　The meeting listened to reports from Shenyang, Anshan, Benxi, Fushun, Dalian, and other places, as well as from the railway, coal mining, and power industries. It also heard typical workshop reports from the Linkou Locomotive Depot, Zhao Guoyou's lathe department, the Dalian Iron Factory, and the Xin Jian Company's machinery factory, as well as speeches from specially invited technical personnel. Zhang Tianmin, the Minister of Production of the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions, and Wang Heshou, the Minister of the Northeast Industrial Department, gave detailed reports on issues related to the organization and leadership of the competition and industrial production. During the meeting, in-depth discussions were held on the organization and leadership of the competition, and finally, Zhang Weizhen, the chairman of the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions, made a summary.

　　The meeting believes that the patriotic production competition has been widely launched throughout the region, and the scale of the movement is unprecedented; however, at the same time, the competition has a very serious tendency to be a temporary surge, is not specific and in-depth enough, and has not yet organized the entire working class into the competition. This is reflected in the fact that many factories and mines are still only making general calls for action in the competition conditions, which are somewhat empty and impractical. For example, the conditions set by a group in a factory are: "Everyone must be responsible, everything must be someone's responsibility, and everyone must be responsible everywhere," but it is not clearly stipulated who is responsible for what, and who is responsible for what. In many places, it is proposed in the competition conditions to ensure an attendance rate of 100%, but this is actually difficult to achieve. For example, a paper mill set a goal of guaranteeing to increase the rate of first-class products to over 95%, but the reasons why it failed to reach 95% in the past have not been well examined. The Shenyang Smelter has full confidence in completing its annual task ahead of schedule, and it is listed as the first item in the competition conditions, but the key issue of the factory—that production cannot be increased without improving technology—is not mentioned at all. Due to the continuous attacks by American imperialist aircraft and the constant conspiracies and sabotage by American-Chiang Kai-shek bandits and secret agents, doing a good job in air defense, anti-espionage, anti-theft, and fire prevention has become an important part of leading the competition and ensuring good production. At present, all units and individuals have set out to persist in production under any circumstances in the competition conditions. However, some factories and mines have not conducted in-depth research on this and formulated specific measures. For example, a comrade who inspected the work of a machine factory asked the workers in the steelmaking furnace: "What should be done in the event of an air raid?" The workers said: "Turn off the power and hide, and resume production after the air raid is over." However, what to do with the molten steel solidifying in the furnace? This has not been considered. Obviously, these conditions cannot solve the main problems in the work and promote production, which will damage the enthusiasm of the masses and prevent the competition movement from continuing for a long time. Therefore, in the future, the production competition of various factories and mines must first be based on the specific conditions of the unit and the key problems existing in the work, and after full deliberation and discussion by the workers and masses, formulate accurate and feasible plans or conditions, and then promote the completion of the plan through various specific measures. The inspection and competition method implemented by Zhao Guoyou's lathe department is a good example. They inspect product quality, attendance rate, security, technical learning, completion of tasks, and the implementation of the responsibility system in each unit every day, and set inspection standards, adding points and deducting points according to the quality of the work. The Dalian Yuandian Glass Factory publishes the workers' production records every day, dividing the records into categories such as exceeding, completing, and not completing. This inspires and promotes employees to continuously exert their enthusiasm and talents, strive for increased production, and make the competition sustainable for a long time. At the same time, this inspection also lays the foundation for reward work.

　　Zhang Weizhen, Chairman of the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions, pointed out in his summary at the meeting: The patriotic production competition must become a regular and lasting movement, and any tendencies towards a temporary surge must be corrected. At the same time, while the broad masses of employees are striving for production with high patriotic enthusiasm, trade union cadres must better unite technical personnel, unite the entire working class, pay attention to solving the difficulties of employees at any time, and create more Ma Hengchang-style groups and more advanced workshops.

　　东北总工会生产部长联席会总结竞赛经验
    确定有计划地深入竞赛运动
    竞赛条件须具体实际职工困难须随时解决
    【本报讯】据东北日报消息：东北总工会为交流爱国主义生产竞赛的经验，进一步推动运动的深入，于本月十五日至十八日召开各省、市产业工会生产部长联席会议。全国总工会生产部长董昕特地前往指导。会议并邀请九名技术人员列席参加。
    会议听取了沈阳、鞍山、本溪、抚顺、旅大等地及铁路、煤矿、电业各产业工会的汇报，并听取了林口机务段、赵国有车工部、大连铁工厂、新建公司机械厂的典型车间报告及特邀列席技术人员的发言。东北总工会生产部长张天民、东北工业部部长王鹤寿分别对竞赛组织领导问题及工业生产问题作了详尽的报告。会中，对竞赛的组织领导问题曾作了深入的讨论，最后由东北总工会主席张维桢进行总结。
    会议认为，爱国主义的生产竞赛已在全区范围内广泛地展开，运动规模之大为历次所未有；但同时，竞赛存在有极严重的突击一时的偏向，不够具体和深入，还没有把全体工人阶级组织到竞赛中。这表现在目前有不少厂矿所提出的竞赛条件，还只限于一般号召，有些空洞不合实际。如某厂一个小组订的条件是：“人人要负责，事事有人负责，处处有人负责”，但究竟什么人负什么责？什么事谁负责？却无明确规定。有不少地方，在竞赛条件中提出保证出勤率达到百分之百，而实际上很难做到。如某造纸厂订出保证把一等品比率提高到百分之九十五以上，可是对过去达不到百分之九十五的原因，却未很好检查。沈阳冶炼厂已有充分把握提前完成全年任务，在竞赛条件中，又把它列为第一条，而对于该厂的关键问题——如不提高技术即不能提高生产，则一字未提。由于美帝飞机的不断袭击及美蒋匪特时时在进行阴谋破坏，如何作好防空、防奸、防盗、防火工作，已成为领导竞赛、保证搞好生产的一项重要内容。目前所有单位、个人的竞赛条件中，都订出要在任何情况下坚持生产。但有些厂矿并未对此进行深入的研究和订出具体办法。如到某机械厂检查工作的同志问炼钢炉的工人：“有了空袭时怎么办？”工人说：“电门一关去躲避，空袭过去再生产。”但是，钢水冷凝在炉里怎么办？却没有考虑到。显然，这些条件是不能解决工作中的主要问题，而使生产前进的，这将会损害群众的热情，不能使竞赛运动长期的坚持下去。因此，今后各厂矿的生产竞赛，首先必须根据本单位的具体情况及工作中存在的关健问题，经过职工群众充分的酝酿讨论，订出确切可行的计划或条件，进而通过各种具体办法，促使计划的完成。赵国有车工部所实行的检查竞赛办法就是一种很好的例子。他们每天在各单位检查产品质量、出勤率、保安、技术学习、任务的完成及责任制实行的情形，并订了检查标准，根据所作的好坏，加分扣分。大连远电玻璃工厂则每日公布工人的生产纪录，纪录中分超过、完成、未完成等类别。这就启发和推动职工不断发挥自己的热情和才能，争取生产的提高，使竞赛可以长期持续。同时，这种检查也为奖励工作打下了基础。
    东北总工会张维桢主席在会议总结中指出：爱国主义的生产竞赛必须变成经常持久的运动，任何带有突击性的偏向必须纠正。同时，在广大职工以高度的爱国热情奋力进行生产的情况下，工会干部必须更好地团结技术人员，团结全体工人阶级，随时注意解决职工的困难，创造更多的马恒昌式的小组和更多的先进车间。
