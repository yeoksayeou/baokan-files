Xinhua News Agency, New York, 15th (TASS): A thousand members of the American progressive organization "American Women for Peace Association" arrived in New York in mid-October from cities along the east coast of the United States, with the aim of appealing to the United Nations General Assembly on United Nations Day (October 24th) to strengthen this organization as a tool for maintaining world peace and to renew efforts to peacefully resolve various outstanding issues that undermine international peace, including the prohibition of all types of weapons of mass destruction.

    Because the aforementioned women's delegation was not permitted to enter the Flushing Meadows United Nations Building on October 24th, the delegation's committee sent a letter to Vyshinsky requesting him to answer six questions, which, according to the letter, were of concern to the organization's members and women worldwide. The delegation also sent similar questions to the delegations of the United States, Britain, France, India, and other countries.

    Vyshinsky received six representatives of the organization, headed by Chairman Dr. Baerwald, on November 11th.

    Dr. Baerwald, the head of the delegation, said: "The American Women for Peace Association" has two main goals. The first is to strive for the elimination of weapons of mass destruction, especially the atomic bomb. The second is to strive for the peaceful resolution of existing problems, especially the Korean question.

    Representative Koleman said: Many women representatives are currently in New York attending a conference, the purpose of which is to combat the propaganda of atomic bombs and war hysteria that is being instilled into children in New York schools.

    Representative Wukowiki said: Her personal contact with working-class women, especially those from families working in the coal, steel, and transportation industries, has convinced her that these women want peace and do not want an atomic war. They know that the Soviet Union wants peace and is fighting for peace.

    The Soviet Union Is Building a New Society and Resolutely Defending Peace and Opposing War
    Vyshinsky pointed out in the conversation: As I have heard, American women, regardless of race, now have a major cause; this is also the cause of our Russian women; not only the cause of Russian women, but also the cause of women throughout the Soviet Union; and not only the cause of women, but also the cause of all mankind, men and women. It is gratifying to hear how hard you are working to ensure peace, and how hard you are working to stop the war that people of all ages in our country hate. This is not only because we have personally experienced the horrors of war; the American people have been fortunate enough never to have encountered these horrors. This is indeed very fortunate. But our country has suffered such horrors many times in its thousand-year history. We oppose war, not only because we know the pain and disaster of war, but also because we are Soviet people, and for Soviet people, war is the main factor that makes it difficult to organize a new socialist society. We want to build a new society and are building a new society. Only madmen or dishonest people can imagine that people who are building a socialist society can strive to launch a war. This is not true. Vyshinsky further said: We are a peaceful people, a people of peaceful labor, so we oppose war, but we are not just a peaceful people. We know how to defend our freedom, defend our glory, and our families. We are not afraid of enemies. We know how to fight for a just cause. We know how to defend ourselves, and we know that there is no force in the world that can confront and defeat people who are fighting for a just cause and for the truth. Such people will always find friends in other nations and other countries, and we hope that the number of these friends will increase, and that they will be steadfast and fearless in their struggle for the truth.

    Women have always played a special role and set a courageous example in the struggle for justice.

    In the war against the Hitlerite bandits who attacked our country, many glorious names emerged among Soviet women. For example, Zoya (i.e., Dan Niang). Our people have offered many such heroines. Those who fought for their homeland cannot threaten the homelands of their sisters in other countries.

    Vyshinsky asked the representatives to "never believe the slander that the Soviet people are planning to wage war against any other country. Things have never been this way. And they never will be. But we are always preparing to repel those who want to start a new war."

    Vyshinsky emphasized: "Peace is the main condition for the happiness of the people, and war is the greatest disaster for all countries, for the whole world, and generally, primarily, and mainly for workers, peasants, and working people. Capitalists never join the ranks of the army to fight. At most, they command the masses of people who are used as cannon fodder. And the entire burden of war falls on the workers, on the general working people, on the poor."

    The Soviet Union Has Always Supported the Full Equality of All Countries and Advocated the Peaceful Resolution of Disputes Between Countries
    During the conversation, Vyshinsky answered the questions raised by the representatives of the American Women for Peace Association. When the representatives asked him whether he thought that the United Nations, five years after its establishment, was fulfilling its original purpose of peacefully resolving disputes between countries, he said: It cannot be said that the United Nations is currently successfully fulfilling its task of peacefully resolving disputes between countries. If this organization is truly an international organization and does not become a tool of any powerful country or group of countries, it will be able to fulfill this task.

    The representatives asked: "In your government's opinion, is it possible (and do you agree) for the heads of major countries to meet and discuss various issues that threaten peace in the same spirit of cooperation as the United Nations was founded?" Vyshinsky replied: Of course it is possible, and of course we agree to such measures as meetings of the heads of major countries to discuss issues related to strengthening peace.

    "Does your government endorse a policy regarding the people of Asia that allows them to participate in solving problems that threaten peace in the Far East on an equal footing?" Vyshinsky's answer to this question was affirmative. Vyshinsky said that the Soviet Union has always supported and still supports the full equality of all the peoples of the world, especially the peoples of Asian countries, and advocates that foreign interference in other countries' internal affairs should not be allowed.

    Then the delegation asked: "How will your government assure the mothers and children of the world that you will promote the prohibition and prevention of the use of atomic weapons in war, something that is incompatible with the honor and conscience of the peoples of the world?" Vyshinsky said that the best guarantee is always action. The Soviet Union has always unswervingly fought for the unconditional prohibition of atomic weapons, which are incompatible with the honor and conscience of the people, and the Soviet government has already given this guarantee to the mothers and children of the world through this struggle. The Soviet Union has always been, and still is, in favor of a complete and unconditional ban on atomic weapons, even though it does indeed possess atomic weapons itself. We advocated the prohibition of atomic weapons when we did not have them. Now that we have them, we continue to demand the prohibition of atomic weapons, and I think this is right. We also demand, as Marshal Stalin said, the establishment of strict international control to supervise the implementation of this ban. We also demand that the government that first uses the atomic bomb be declared a war criminal. Obviously, this cannot please the candidates for war criminals, but we demand it.

    The representatives asked: "What does your government believe is the quickest and most effective way to end the massive deaths and large-scale destruction of property currently occurring in the Korean conflict?" Vyshinsky replied: As stated in your fifth question, the simplest, quickest, and most effective way to end the massive loss of life and large-scale destruction of property in Korea is to stop the war and for the United States and other foreign troops to immediately withdraw from Korea.

    The delegation asked: "Do you agree that the women of your country should take the lead in reaching out to women in other parts of the world to freely exchange the cultural ideas and friendship necessary for lasting peace?" Vyshinsky said: Women in our country are very actively participating in various international democratic organizations, especially those whose main purpose is to strengthen international peace and the security of all nations and to fight against the threat of new wars.

    The Soviet Union is in favor of the free exchange of opinions, the exchange of ideas, and cultural cooperation among nations and the development of friendship between them, so our answer to the question of whether we agree that the women of our country should take the lead in strengthening international peace is of course affirmative. Yes, we are in favor of this. Furthermore, we believe that this is the duty of the women of our country.

    The UN Charter Is Being Violated Every Day and We Are Fighting Against This Situation
    The head of the delegation, Baerwald, said: "On October 24th, a delegation of a thousand American women tried to enter the United Nations building, but as in the case of Washington, although they had notified the American liaison officer in advance of their intention, they were unable to enter. When they arrived, the guards said: They had received orders not to allow the delegation to enter. At Lake Success, things were even worse: there the guards said that if necessary, they would use force to stop the representatives."

    Mrs. Baerwald said: "We would like to know if Mr. Vyshinsky does not think that the responsibility for this incident should be borne by the entire United Nations? Do you not think that this is a violation of the United Nations Charter? We have asked Mr. Lie for an explanation, and we would also like to ask, in Mr. Vyshinsky's opinion, how can the United Nations avoid falling into such a disgusting situation again?"

    Vyshinsky replied: Recently, especially due to the attitude of some powerful delegations at the General Assembly, the Charter has in fact ceased to function.

    Indeed, the Charter does not stipulate whether or not to allow delegations to attend United Nations meetings, but if the meetings are open, anyone holding a conference pass or ticket can attend if there is space in the meeting hall. But I am not surprised by the violations of the Charter you mentioned.

    Currently, some powerful United Nations delegations do not want to consider the democratic principles on which the Charter is based, and therefore the Charter is being violated every day. We are fighting against this situation, but we are not the majority. If a minority protests these violations of the Charter, they can never be held responsible for the arbitrariness practiced by the majority, and we will always protest. We hope that there will be no such violations of democratic principles when we are in the majority.

    Currently, even on more important issues, the Charter is being violated. The Secretary-General himself has been illegally appointed for another three years. If the Secretary-General was illegally appointed, then his actions are also illegal.

    Vyshinsky concluded by congratulating the American Women for Peace Association on its victory in its great and noble struggle for peace.

    维辛斯基接见美国妇女代表
    宣示苏联人民为正义事业斗争决心答复有关国际和平合作的六项问题
    【新华社讯】塔斯社纽约十五日电：美国进步组织“美国妇女争取和平协会”所属会员一千人，于十月中旬自美国东海岸各城市抵达纽约，目的是要在联合国日（十月二十四日）呼吁联合国大会加强这一作为维护世界和平之工具的组织。并重新努力争取和平解决各种未决的破坏国际和平的问题，包括禁止各种大规模毁灭性武器的问题。
    由于上述的妇女代表团于十月二十四日未得许可进入佛拉辛草地联合国大厦，这个代表团的委员会即致信维辛斯基，请求他答复六个问题，据来信说，这些是该组织的会员和全世界妇女所挂虑的问题。该代表团并以相似的问题，分别送交美、英、法、印度等国代表团。
    维辛斯基于十一月十一日接见以主席巴奥朗博士为首的该组织六位代表。
    代表团团长巴奥朗博士说：“美国妇女争取和平协会”有两个主要的目标。第一是努力争取消毁大规模毁灭性武器，特别是原子弹。第二是努力争取以和平方式解决现存各种难题，特别是朝鲜问题。
    代表柯雷蔓说：妇女代表多人，目前正在纽约并出席一个会议，举行这个会议的目的乃是对硬灌输给纽约学校中的儿童的宣传，原子弹和战争歇斯底里的宣传作斗争。
    代表伍柯薇琪说：她亲自和工人阶级的妇女，特别是和以煤炭钢铁工业和运输业工作为业的家庭的交往，使她相信这些妇女是要和平，不要原子战争的。她们知道苏联要和平并且正在为和平而奋斗。
    苏联正在建设新的社会坚决保卫和平反对战争
    维辛斯基在谈话时指出：像我所听到的那样，现在美国妇女，不分种族，有一个主要的事业；这也是我们俄罗斯妇女的事业；不仅是俄罗斯妇女的事业，而且还是苏联全国妇女的事业；并且也不仅是妇女的事业，而且还是全人类男女的事业。听到多么努力保证和平，多么努力阻止我国人不分老幼都痛恨的战争，真是令人高兴。这不仅仅是因为我们曾亲身经历过战争的恐怖；这种恐怖美国人民很幸运地从来还没有遭遇过。这的确是很大的运气。但是我们的国家在它千年以来的历史中，都遭受了许多次这样的恐怖。我们反对战争，不仅仅是因为我们知道战争的痛苦与灾难，而且还是因为我们是苏维埃人民，对于苏维埃人民说来，战争是使得组织新的社会主义社会发生困难的主要因素，我们要建设新的社会且正在建设新的社会。只有疯子或不正直的人们才能设想：正在建设社会主义社会的人民能够力图发动战争。这不是真情实况。维辛斯基进一步说：我们是和平的人民，和平劳动的人民，因此，我们反对战争，但是我们不仅仅是和平的人民。我们懂得保卫我们的自由，保卫我们的光荣和我们的家庭。我们是不怕敌人的。我们知道如何为正义的事业而斗争。我们知道如何保卫我们自己并且我们知道世界上没有任何力量能和为正义的、真理的事业而斗争的人民对抗而不败。这样的人民总会在别的民族和别的国家中找到朋友的，并且我们希望这些朋友的数目增多，希望他们在为真理而斗争中坚贞不屈，勇敢无畏。
    妇女们在争取正义的斗争中一向都是起特殊的作用，作出勇敢的榜样。
    在反对进攻我国的希特勒匪徒的战争中，苏联妇女中间涌现出来许多光荣的名字。例如佐雅（按即丹娘）就是。我们的人民已供献出许多这样的女英雄。那些为她们的祖国而战的人是不可能威胁她们在其他国家中的姊妹的祖国的。
    维辛斯基请各代表“永远也不要相信说什么苏联人民正在计划对其他任何国家进行战争的谰言。事情从来就不是这样。也永远不会是这样。但是，我们是经常都在准备击退一些想发动新战争的人们”。
    维辛斯基强调说：“和平是人民幸福的主要条件，而战争是一切国家、是全世界、并且一般地、首先地、主要地是工农与劳动人民的最大灾难。资本家们从来也不参加到军队行伍中去作战。他们所做的至多也只是指挥给他们当炮灰的人民群众。而整个的战争负担却落在工人身上、落在一般劳动人民身上、落在穷人身上。”
    苏联一直支持各国充分平等主张和平解决各国间的纠纷
    在谈话中间，维辛斯基答复了美国妇女争取和平协会代表们所提出的问题。当代表们问他是否认为联合国组织在成立五年后，正在履行它那和平解决各国间纠纷的原来目的的问题时，他说：目前不能说联合国组织正在成功地履行它那和平解决各国间纠纷的任务。如果这个组织真正是国际组织而不成为任何有势力的国家或一群国家的工具，它就将能够履行这个任务。
    代表们问：“依照贵国政府的意见，是否有可能（而且你们是否赞同）各主要国家的元首会晤，并重以与联合国建立之初衷相同的合作精神来讨论各种威胁和平的问题呢？”维辛斯基答：当然可能，而且我们当然赞成像主要国家元首会晤并讨论有关加强和平的问题这样的措施。
    “贵国政府是否赞同采取一个关于亚洲人民的政策，这政策要使他们能以平等地位参加解决威胁远东和平的问题？”维辛斯基对这问题的回答是肯定的。维辛斯基称，苏联一直都是支持而且现在仍然支持全世界各国的人民，特别是亚洲各国人民的充分平等，并且主张不容许外国干涉他国的内政。
    接着该代表团问：“贵国政府将怎样向全世界的母亲和孩子们保证：你们将促进禁止和防止在战争中使用原子武器，这种与全世界各国人民的光荣和良心不能相容的东西？”维辛斯基说，最好的保证始终是行动。苏联始终不渝为无条件禁止这种与人民的光荣和良心不能相容的原子武器而斗争，苏联政府就已经用这种斗争向全世界的母亲和孩子们作了这种保证。苏联过去是，现在也是主张完全地、无条件地禁止原子武器，虽然事实上它本身确实拥有原子武器。我们在没有原子武器的时候便主张禁止原子武器。现在我们也有了这种武器，可是我们却继续要求禁止原子武器，而且我认为这是对的。我们并要求，如斯大林大元帅所说的，建立严格的国际管制来监督这种禁令的执行。我们并要求，宣布首先使用原子弹的政府为战争罪犯。显然这是不能使战争罪犯的候选人高兴的，但我们却要求这样。
    代表们问：“贵国政府以为什么是终止目前在朝鲜冲突中发生的大量死亡和大批财产毁灭现象最迅速和最有效的方法呢？”维辛斯基答道：如你们第五个问题所说的，终止在朝鲜发生的大量生命死亡和大批财产毁灭的现象最简单、最迅速和最有效的方法，便是停止战争并且美国和其他外国军队立即撤出朝鲜。
    代表团问：“你们赞成贵国的妇女带头向世界其他地方的妇女伸出手来自由交流为持久和平所必需的文化思想和友谊吗？”维辛斯基说：我国妇女是非常积极地参加各种国际民主组织，特别是那些其主要目的是在加强国际和平与各民族安全及与新战争的威胁作斗争的组织。
    苏联赞成自由交换意见，交流思想，赞成各民族间的文化合作及他们之间友谊的发展，因此，我们对于我们是否赞成我国妇女带头加强国际和平的问题的答复当然是肯定的。是的，我们是赞成这件事的。还要进一步，我们认为这是我国妇女的职责。
    联合国宪章天天遭受破坏我们正向这种情况作斗争
    代表团团长巴奥朗说：“十月二十四日，一千美国妇女的代表团设法进入联合国组织大厦，但是像以前在华盛顿的情形一样，虽然她们预先已把她们的意向通知了美国联络官，但是她们并没有能够进去。当她们到了的时候，卫兵说：他们已得到命令不准代表团进去。在成功湖，事情更糟糕些：那里的卫兵说，如果必要的话，他们就用武力制止代表们。”
    巴奥朗夫人说：“我们愿意知道，难道维辛斯基先生不认为这个事件的责任应由整个联合国组织来担负吗？难道您不认为这是违犯联合国宪章的吗？我们已经请赖伊先生予以解释，此外，我们愿意问一下，在维辛斯基先生看来，联合国怎样才能避免再陷入这种丑恶的情形呢？”
    维辛斯基回答说：近来，特别是由于某些有势力的代表团在大会上的态度，宪章实际上已不起作用了。
    的确，宪章并没有规定准许或不准许各代表团参加联合国会议，但是如果会议是公开的话，凡持有会议证或入场券的人，在会议厅内有地方时就都可以参加。但是你所说的违反宪章的行为并不使我感到惊讶。
    目前，某些有势力的联合国代表团并不想考虑作为宪章基础的民主原则，因此，宪章天天都在遭受破坏。我们正在向这种情况作斗争，但我们不是多数。如果少数抗议这些破坏宪章的行为，他们就决不能为多数所实行的专横独断负责，而且我们永远要抗议的。我们希望：当我们占有多数时，不会有这种违反民主原则的情形。
    目前，甚至在较重要的问题上，也在违反宪章。秘书长本人就已被非法地指定再任三年。如果说秘书长是非法任命的，那么他的行动也就是非法的。
    维辛斯基在末尾祝贺美国妇女争取和平协会在其伟大而崇高的争取和平的斗争事业中获得胜利。
