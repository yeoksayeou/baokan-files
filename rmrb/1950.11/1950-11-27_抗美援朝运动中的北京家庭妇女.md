　　Beijing Housewives in the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement
　　A Long
　　Beijing's housewives have demonstrated a high degree of patriotism in the Resist America, Aid Korea movement. While millions are working hard in factories and schools to defend peace, they have become powerful assistants to countless workers and producers; they have become active propagandists and mobilizers; and they have contributed their husbands to the cause of peace for the motherland and the world.
　　Be a Good Helper
　　The families of workers at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, upon hearing that American imperialism was about to expand its war of aggression and had bombed our Northeast dozens of times with airplanes, were filled with indescribable anger. Everyone clearly realized that without eliminating this wolf, there would be no good days. On November 8th, the women's committee members above the group leader level held a meeting to discuss how the workers' families could contribute their share in the Resist America, Aid Korea movement. Everyone unanimously proposed: first, to avoid distracting those who go to work, not to be a burden to them, and to allow them to concentrate on production; not to let them eat cold food or drink cold water, and to protect their health; and, when necessary, to unhesitatingly encourage husbands and sons to join the Volunteer Army and defeat American imperialism as soon as possible. The wife of model worker Li Jinquan said, "I hate American imperialism to the core. My husband has already signed up to join the Volunteer Army, and I will never hold him back. Before he leaves, I will help him continue to research welding rods." A woman surnamed Wang said, "I want to encourage my husband to produce well, and guarantee that he will not be late or leave early. I myself will also do a good job in propaganda."
　　Sew a Comfort Bag to Encourage Victory
　　Wu, an elderly woman in the adult night school of the Third Cultural Center and a military dependent, is fifty-nine years old this year. In the past fifty-nine years, Wu has shed many tears and suffered a lot. When the Japanese devils were here, she couldn't even get mixed flour. When the Kuomintang came, she was still worrying about two meals of corn bread every day. After liberation, her two older sons joined the army, and the two younger ones also found jobs, and she no longer had to worry about food and drink. Wu, at such an old age, could also go to night school to study and was even selected as a study model. A few days ago, she attended a meeting at the cultural center and, upon hearing that American imperialism was trying to destroy our stable life, she could hardly contain her anger. She said, "Wishful thinking! The Chinese people are not easy to bully." After the meeting ended at nine o'clock in the evening, she immediately found cloth and began sewing a comfort bag. She was old, her eyes were blurry, and her hands trembled when she picked up the needle, but she still sewed hard, stitch by stitch. She felt like she was stabbing American devils.
　　The next morning, Wu sent the comfort bag she had made overnight to the cultural center. She said to the cadre of the cultural center, "Comrade, please write my name on it. There isn't much stuff; it's what I saved from my food money. Our soldiers, fighting the American devils, don't forget to study culture, so I bought a notebook; I also bought a towel and two bars of soap. It's not convenient for the soldiers to buy things on the front lines, so this little bit expresses my feelings."
　　Happily Send Husband to Join the Volunteer Army
　　Wang Shufang, a member of the Women's Federation, and her husband were studying at the Revolutionary University. After the Resist America, Aid Korea movement began, they agreed to start a competition in their respective positions. Wang Shufang actively participated in propaganda work, and her husband resolutely signed up to join the Volunteer Army.
　　On the 17th, her husband came home from school to get clothes. On the way, he ran into Wang Shufang doing propaganda on the street. He didn't want to disturb Shufang, so he told the other sisters that he would be leaving that day and asked Shufang to work hard and not worry about him. The sisters pulled Wang Shufang out of the team. The husband said, "Don't be sad, do a good job." Wang Shufang said very firmly, "Don't worry about me, I will definitely work hard. I will participate in all the work I should do, and I will use as much strength as I have." The next day, she happily went to do propaganda with the propaganda team again. She said, "I'm working here, competing with him, waiting for him to defeat American imperialism and return victoriously."
　　Housewives' Propaganda Team
　　The forty-eight housewives of the Nancheng Group of the Beijing Women's Federation organized a propaganda team to go to the streets to spread propaganda, bringing the crimes of American imperialism to every corner. Some told stories with clapper boards, some performed short plays, and the sisters in their thirties and forties also put on colorful clothes and performed the Yangko dance on the streets. The propaganda team went around the east, south, west, and north of the city, singing from morning till night, but no one complained of being tired because they knew that this was also doing their part in the Resist America, Aid Korea movement.
　　Li Xiuying and Li Xiuwen's short play, with one playing an activist and the other playing a backward element, arguing on the street, had a great effect. When the backward element said, "America is not bad, they even give us white flour," many people angrily condemned her. Some said, "She must be educated." When the sisters of the propaganda team denounced the crimes of American imperialism, many people followed them in shouting the slogan "Defeat the American aggressors!" Some women, after listening to the propaganda, joined the propaganda team while holding their children. An old lady in her fifties followed the propaganda team for two days and asked, "Can I sign up to join your propaganda?" Some people who had seen their propaganda said, "The times are really different. In the past, it was students who did propaganda, but now even housewives are coming out to do propaganda."

　　抗美援朝运动中的北京家庭妇女
    阿龙
    北京的家庭妇女们在抗美援朝运动中表现了高度的爱国主义精神。当千万人在工厂、学校为保卫和平而努力的时候，她们成为无数的各种工作者、生产者的有力助手；成为积极的宣传鼓动者；而且把自己的丈夫贡献给祖国和世界的和平事业。
    做个好助手
    石景山钢铁厂的工属们，听说美帝要扩大侵略战争，并且用飞机几十次的轰炸我东北的时候，心里充满了说不出的愤怒，大家都清楚的认识到：不消灭这只狼，就不会有好日子过。十一月八日，小组长以上的妇女委员开了一次会，讨论工属们在抗美援朝运动中怎样尽自己的一份力量。大家一致提出：首先做到不分上班人的心，不做他们的包袱，让他们安心生产；不让他们吃冷饭、喝冷水，保护他们身体健康；并且在必要时毫不犹豫地鼓励丈夫、儿子参加志愿军，早日打垮美帝。劳模李金泉的老婆说：“我恨透了美帝，我丈夫已经报名参加志愿军，我决不扯后腿，并且在他走以前帮助他继续研究焊条。”一个姓王的大娘说：“我要鼓励丈夫好好生产，保证他不迟到，不早退，我自己还要做好宣传工作。”
    缝个慰问袋鼓励打胜仗
    第三文化馆成人夜校军属吴大娘，今年五十九岁了。过去的五十九年当中，吴大娘流过不少泪，吃过不少苦，日本鬼子在时，连混合面都吃不上，国民党来了，还是整天为两顿窝头发愁。解放后，两个大儿子参了军，两个小的也找到了工作，再也不愁吃喝了。这样大年纪的吴大娘，也能到夜校去学习，还被选上了学习模范。前些天她在文化馆开会，听说美帝要求破坏我们安定的生活时，简直压不住她的愤怒。她说：“妄想！中国人民不是好欺侮的。”晚上九点钟开完会回家，立刻找出布缝起慰问袋。年岁大了，眼睛花了，拿起针来手打颤，但她仍用劲缝着，一针挨一针，她觉得她在扎美国鬼子。
    第二天清早，吴大娘把连夜赶制的慰问袋送到文化馆，她对着文化馆的干部说：“同志，给我写上个名字，东西不多，是我省下菜钱买的。咱们战士，打美国鬼子，忘不了学文化，我买了个本子；还买了条毛巾，两块胰子。战士们在前方买东西不方便，这点东西就表表咱的心。”
    欢欢喜喜送夫参加志愿军
    妇女联谊会的会员王淑芳，丈夫在革大学习，这次抗美援朝运动展开后，他们俩就约好在各人的岗位上展开竞赛。王淑芳积极地参加了宣传工作，丈夫更坚决的报名参加了志愿军。
    十七日，他丈夫从学校回家拿衣服，路上碰着王淑芳在街头宣传，他不愿意打搅淑芳，就告诉别的姊妹，他当天就出发，让淑芳好好的工作不要惦记他。姊妹们从队里拉出王淑芳，丈夫说：“不要难过，好好搞工作。”王淑芳非常坚定地说：“别耽心我，我一定努力。凡是我应该做的工作，我都参加，有多大力量用多大力量。”第二天又高兴地随着宣传队去宣传。她说，“我在这儿干，和他比赛，等着他打垮美帝胜利归来。”
    家庭妇女的宣传队
    北京妇女联谊会南城小组的四十八个家庭姊妹，组织了一个宣传队上街宣传，把美帝的罪恶宣传到每一个角落里。有的说快板，有的演话报剧，三四十岁的姊妹们也穿起花衣在大街上扭秧歌。宣传队绕遍了东、南、西、北城，从早唱到黑，但没有一个人喊累，因为他们知道这也是在抗美援朝当中尽了自己的一份力量。
    李秀英和李秀文的活报剧，一个做积极分子，一个装落后分子，在大街上争论，收到了很大效果。当落后分子说：“美国不好还给白面吃”的时候，许多群众都气愤地指责她，有人说：“非得教育教育她。”当宣传队的姊妹们控诉美帝罪行时，好多人都跟着他们喊打垮美国侵略军的口号。有些妇女听了宣传以后，抱着孩子参加宣传队。一个五十多岁的老太太跟着宣传队走了两天，并且问道：“我能报名参加你们的宣传吗？”还有一些群众看过他们的宣传以后说：“年月真不同了，过去都是学生宣传，现在连家庭妇女也出来宣传了。”
