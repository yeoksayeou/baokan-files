　　Yanjing University Faculty Forum Sends Letter to the Government Administration Council, Suggesting a Ban on Listening to "Voice of America"
　　[Our Newspaper] The faculty forum held at Yanjing University on the 16th and 17th of this month discussed the harmfulness of "Voice of America" and unanimously decided to send a letter to the Central People's Government Administration Council, suggesting that appropriate measures be taken to ban listening to "Voice of America." The original text of the letter is as follows: To the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government via the Trade Union Branch of the Yanjing University Committee for the Defense of World Peace and Opposition to American Aggression:
　　Recently, American imperialism has intensified its aggression against Korea and China. In addition to military actions, it has also used "Voice of America" to spread rumors, disturb people's minds, and attempt to paralyze the will of our people to fight against imperialism. This kind of vicious propaganda tactic is exactly the same as the espionage activities of American imperialism in China and the secret plots of the Kuomintang reactionaries. It is an important aggressive tool for the enemy to undermine the new China. We, the faculty and staff of Yanjing University who have participated in the forum for several days, have analyzed the despicable means of American imperialism's cultural aggression and propaganda warfare in the discussions, and have seen through their treachery and deeply hate them. In order to consolidate ideological national defense and smash enemy special agent conspiracies, in addition to the teachers participating in the forum taking the lead and suggesting that the school's trade union call on all colleagues to launch moral sanctions and consciously not listen to "Voice of America," we specifically suggest that Your Council take appropriate measures to ban listening to "Voice of America" and prevent all enemy rumor activities.

　　燕大教员座谈会致函政务院  建议取缔收听“美国之音”
    【本报讯】燕京大学十六、十七两日连续举行的教员座谈会上，讨论了“美国之音”的危害性，一致决定致函中央人民政府政务院，建议采取适当措施，取缔收听“美国之音”。该函原文如下：燕京大学保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会工会分会转致中央人民政府政务院：
    最近美帝国主义加紧侵略朝鲜和中国，除军事行动以外，还利用“美国之音”，散播谣言，扰乱人心，企图麻痹我们人民反帝斗争的意志。这种恶毒的宣传手段与美帝国主义在华的间谍活动，国民党反动派的特务阴谋是完全一样，是敌人破坏新中国的一个重要侵略工具。我们，燕京大学连日参加座谈会的教职员在讨论中分析了美帝对华文化侵略及宣传战的卑劣手段，已洞烛其奸，深切痛恨。为了巩固思想国防，粉碎敌特阴谋，除参加座谈讨论的教员带头作起，并建议本校工会，号召全体同人，发动道义制裁，自觉地不听“美国之音”以外，特建议钧院采取适当措施，取缔收听“美国之音”，并防止一切敌人谣言活动。
