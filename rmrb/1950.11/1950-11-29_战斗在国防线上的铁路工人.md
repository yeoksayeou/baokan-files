　　Railway Workers Fighting on the National Defense Line
    Chen Ji
    To Protect Our Homes and Defend Our Country, Airplanes Cannot Frighten Us
    Railway workers in Andong City, seeing American planes fly over the motherland's skies and machine gun bullets pierce the roofs of factories, suppressed their anger and steadfastly remained at their posts, working even more diligently. Wang Jingbin of the Andong City Railway Telephone Station never left her studio, guarding the telephone. She said, "Under no circumstances will we allow the telephone to be interrupted for even a second!" She understands that the telephone is the nerve center of the railway, a crucial part of completing transportation tasks. She and all the telephone operators guarantee that Andong's railway telephone will always be clear, and even if damaged by American planes, it will be repaired immediately. Cai Zhizhong, who recently transferred from another location to help with the work at Andong Station, is a role model for everyone. In 1948, Cai Zhizhong worked at Tongliao Station. At that time, American-made Chiang Kai-shek planes bombed Tongliao all day long, attempting to prevent the People's Liberation Army from advancing. Cai Zhizhong, disregarding the enemy's frantic bombing, held fast to his post, braving the rain of bullets to repair the damaged lines, and informing relevant sections and stations of the line conditions at all times, thus enabling trains to depart on time. Today, Cai Zhizhong has arrived in Andong, and all of Andong's railway workers are learning from his heroic actions. On October 25th, under the influence of Cai Zhizhong, station switchman Sun Changfu, regardless of the American planes strafing, bravely extinguished a fire that was about to spread to a dedicated line. His clothes were already burning, but he didn't realize it until he had extinguished the fire.
    Wang Enlun, a nearly sixty-year-old railway worker in Andong, said, "In the past, Japanese devils and Kuomintang reactionaries used airplanes to scare us. Today, American devils are using the same trick, but it doesn't work anymore." Liberated Chinese workers, to protect their homes and defend their country, cannot be frightened. Guo Fengwu, the driver of the Tie Niu (Iron Ox) crew of the Tonghua Locomotive Depot, fearing that the locomotive would be damaged by American planes, did not leave the locomotive for twelve days. Chen Xingshu, a compressor operator at the Benxi Locomotive Depot, moved into the compressor room from his home. He said, "We must ensure that the depot has air available day and night, to produce more and strike back at American imperialism." Fu Xingshan, a driver from Tonghua, had completed his mission but asked the person in charge to remain in the depot, awaiting temporary assignments. He told his colleagues, "To protect our homes and defend our country, how can we leave the site to rest?"
    "The Strength of the Chinese Workers Grows Stronger with Each Blow!"
    "The strength of the Chinese workers grows stronger with each blow!" On October 1st, Xu Guochen, an injured driver from Linjiang Station, holding up his crippled left hand, stood on the platform of the "No. 928" locomotive that had just been repaired after being damaged by American planes, expressing the workers' determination and strength to the masses at Linjiang Station. The "No. 928" had been shot 102 times by American planes. According to the equipment capacity of the locomotive depot, it could not be repaired, but the workers of the Tonghua Locomotive Depot repaired it in only seven days. The workers at Linjiang Station, who had been strafed by American planes, disregarded the American planes' harassment and threats, and their work enthusiasm increased day by day. Xia Yande of the Linjiang shunting crew, which had not had an accident in four and a half years, said, "We must always ensure transportation safety."
    Model figures who had created heroic deeds in supporting the People's Liberation War are constantly encouraging railway workers in Northeast China to advance bravely. Mu Chengbin, a worker on the "No. 3005" heroic train, called on everyone, "We must complete all tasks with a courageous, tenacious, alert, and calm spirit!" In 1948, the crew of the "No. 3005" train, with the determination to sacrifice, continuously transported ammunition to the front lines under repeated strafing and bombing by American-made Chiang Kai-shek planes, supporting the People's Liberation Army. The heroic actions of the "No. 3005" train are being learned by thousands upon thousands of railway workers. Zhang Bingju, the driver of the "No. 150" locomotive at the Chaoyangchuan Locomotive Section of the Tumen Railway Bureau, recently encountered an attack by American planes while on duty in Meihekou. He never left the locomotive. When four planes strafed at low altitude, he calmly prepared the firebox to generate steam. Amidst the sound of the plane engines, he discovered that there was little water in the cylinder. He immediately turned on the water pump and continuously added water. The enemy plane discovered the locomotive and turned back to strafe, breaking the iron shovel in his hand. He still continued to pour water, finally completing the transportation task. Bi Zizhong, a foreman at the Andong Engineering Section, led workers to brave the strafing of American planes, searching everywhere for materials, forgetting to eat and forgetting fatigue. Using these collected materials, they rushed to make "four-headed nails" for repairing bridges, ensuring the progress of the bridge repair project.
    We Must Win Brilliant Victories on the Production Front
    Du Xianyang, the founder of the new record movement on the Northeast Railway – the Iron Ox Movement – issued a resounding call: "We must continuously win brilliant victories on the production front." His call has already become the action of hundreds of thousands of railway employees in Northeast China. Wang Jikui, a special-class labor hero who created over 200,000 kilometers of safe operation, leading the "No. 1195" locomotive, took the lead in launching the "500-Kilometer" movement (the goal of this movement is to achieve 500 kilometers of travel per locomotive per day and night), taking the Iron Ox Movement a step further. During a demonstration test, the "No. 1195" locomotive once created a record of 738.2 kilometers of travel in one day and night. All locomotives at the Ang'angxi Locomotive Depot continuously exceeded an average of 500 kilometers of travel per day and night for three consecutive months. In October, more than 20 percent of the locomotives on the China Changchun Railway reached 500 kilometers of travel per day and night. In the three months of July, August, and September, this movement saved 805 locomotive days (calculated as one locomotive used for one day) in the number of locomotives used in the entire Northeast region compared to the original plan, and the reduction in expenditure due to the saved locomotive days amounted to approximately 20 billion RMB. The Meihekou Zhang Wanshun shunting crew, which first achieved 1,000 days without accidents, put forward the slogan "Do as much as comes (the task)" and challenged the entire Northeast Railway. They renamed their shunting crew the "Resist America, Aid Korea, Protect the Home, and Defend the Country Production Group" to express their fighting will. The originator of the Iron Ox Movement – the "Iron Ox" locomotive – challenged the national model locomotive banner – the "Mao Zedong" locomotive, guaranteeing no accidents, large or small, over-axle, and on-time operation in the fourth-quarter task.
    "One Person Does the Work of Two, Two Days' Work Completed in One Day."
    The railway workers in Northeast China know that in the great struggle to resist America, aid Korea, protect the home, and defend the country, it is extremely important to rapidly improve work efficiency. The railway workers in Shenyang said, "Today we must have one person do the work of two, two days' work completed in one day." They wrote this in the Train Head newspaper: "Two hundred workers come, a hundred workers finish, no steam leaks, no return for repair; everyone works hard together to make the American imperialists come to an end." They try their best to improve work efficiency. Workers at the Qiqihar Locomotive Depot improved labor organization, reducing the time for locomotives to load coal, water, and other operations in the depot from one hour to sixteen minutes; during a temporary shock task that required twelve days to complete, Yang Mingchun, a worker at the Inspection Section, did not sleep for three days. In the cold night, he climbed on the telephone pole alone to repair the electric wire. Snowflakes fell on his clothes, and the snow water soaked through his cotton coat, but he never stopped repairing the wire. Thanks to such arduous efforts, the section completed the twelve-day shock task in five days. Workers at Tonghua Station rushed overnight, with 45 employees loading goods day and night, making the station's loading task in October exceed 400 percent on the 25th. Li Gaotian, a young technician at the Zhengjiatun Locomotive Depot, worked hard and created a cutting machine, increasing production efficiency by 80 times. Zhang Minghai, a driver at the Benxi Locomotive Depot, often completed operation tasks exceeding the axle load by 700 tons.
    "Saving a Piece of Coal is Like Killing an American Aggressor."
    "In the struggle to resist America and aid Korea, we must pay more attention to conservation." This is their slogan. They say, "Saving a piece of coal is like killing an American aggressor." Workers at the Tumen Inspection Section go out to collect materials in their spare time. To date, they have collected vehicle equipment worth 830 million Northeast currency. Each section, station, and production group puts conservation in a very important position in the competition conditions. The main content of the "Iron Ox" locomotive competition is: "Guarantee a monthly savings of 10 percent of coal consumption and 20 percent of mixed oil; strictly implement economic accounting, and save 30 percent of the cost of daily use." Over the past year, the Northeast Railway locomotives have saved 132,000 tons of coal, but they are not satisfied: "In the struggle to resist America and aid Korea, we must strengthen conservation!"

　　战斗在国防线上的铁路工人
    陈迹
    为了保家卫国飞机是吓唬不住的
    安东市铁路工人看到美机从祖国上空掠过，机枪子弹射穿了工厂的屋顶，他们压抑着愤怒，坚定地守在自己的工作岗位，更紧张地工作。安东市铁路电话所王静彬从不离开工作室，守着电话机，她说：“我们无论在什么情况下，决不让电话间断一秒钟！”她懂得电话是铁路的神经，是完成运输任务的重要部分，她和全体电话员保证安东铁路电话永远畅通，即使遭受美机破坏，也要马上修复。最近刚从外地调来帮助安东车站工作的才致中，是大家学习的榜样。一九四八年才致中在通辽车站工作，那时美制蒋机终日轰炸通辽，企图阻止解放军前进，才致中不顾敌人的疯狂轰炸，他坚守着工作岗位，冒着弹雨抢修被炸毁的线路，并把线路情况随时通知有关的段、站，这样终于使列车按时开出。今天才致中到了安东，所有安东的铁路工人都在学习他的英雄行为。十月二十五日，该站调车员孙长福在才致中的影响下，不顾美机的扫射，勇敢扑灭将要殃及专门线路的大火，他的衣服已在燃烧，但他直到把大火扑灭才发觉。
    将近六十岁的安东铁路工人王恩伦说：“过去日本鬼子和国民党反动派惯用飞机来吓唬咱们，今天美国鬼子又用这一套，可不灵了。”解放后的中国工人为了保家卫国，是吓唬不住的。通化机务段基干铁牛乘务组司机郭凤武怕机车遭受美机破坏，在十二天的时间里，他没有离开机车一步。本溪机务段打风司机陈兴树从家里搬进打风室住，他说：“咱要保证段内日夜能用风，多生产，回击美帝。”通化司机傅兴山完成了任务，本该回家休息，但他向负责同志要求留在段内，听候临时任务，他告诉工友：“为了保家卫国，咱怎能离开现场休息？”
    “中国工人的力量是越打越坚强的！”
    “中国工人的力量，是越打越坚强的！”十月一日临江车站受伤司机徐国臣举着他的残废左手，站在刚修好的曾被美机破坏的“九二八号”机车的踏板上，向临江车站的群众表示了工人们的决心与力量。“九二八号”曾被美机射伤一百零二处，按照机务段的设备能力是不能修复的，但通化机务段的工人仅以七天的时间把它修好了。曾遭美机扫射的临江车站的工友们，不顾美机的骚扰与威胁，工作热情日益高涨，四年半没有事故的临江调车组夏延德说：“我们要永远保证运输安全。”
    在支援人民解放战争中，曾创造了英雄事迹的模范人物们，不断地鼓舞着东北铁路工人奋勇前进。“三○○五次”英雄列车工作者穆成斌号召大家：“我们要以勇敢的、顽强的、机警的、沉着的精神，完成一切任务！”一九四八年“三○○五次”列车乘务员抱着牺牲的决心，在美制蒋机反复扫射和轰炸的情况下，不断地把弹药运到前方，支援人民解放军。“三○○五次”列车的英雄行为，已被千千万万铁路工人学习着。图们铁路分局朝阳川机务段“一五○号”机车司机张秉举，最近在梅河口出勤，遇到美机的袭击，他始终没有离开机车。当四架飞机低空扫射时，他不动声色地准备火床烧汽，在飞机的马达声中，他发现缸内水少，他马上拉开水泵，不停地上水，敌机发现了机车，又折返扫射，把他手中的铁锹打断了，他还照样地灌水，终于完成了运输任务。安东工务段工长毕自忠带领工人冒着美机的扫射，到处找材料，忘记了吃饭，忘记了疲劳，利用这些搜集的材料，赶制修复桥梁用的“四头钉”，保证了修桥工程的进行。
    我们要在生产战线上打出漂亮的胜仗
    东北铁路的新纪录运动——铁牛运动的创始者杜先扬发出响亮的号召：“我们还要连续地在生产战线上打出漂亮的胜仗。”他的号召已经成为全东北数十万铁路员工的行动了。创造二十万以上安全走行公里的特等劳动英雄王吉魁领导的“一一九五号”机车，带头展开“五百公里”运动（这一运动的目标是实现一台机车一昼夜行驶五百公里），把铁牛运动更向前发展了一步。“一一九五号”机车在一次示范试验中，曾创造了一昼夜走行七百三十八点二公里的最高纪录。昂昂溪机务段所有机车连续在三个月内平均每昼夜都超过行驶五百公里。中国长春铁路在十月份有百分之二十以上的机车达到了一昼夜行驶五百公里。在七、八、九三个月内，这个运动使东北全区机车的使用数目较原计划节省了八百零五个机车日（以每台机车使用一天为一个机车日计算），因节省机车日而减少的开支折合人民币约达二十余亿元。首创千天无事故的梅河口张万顺调车组，提出“来多少（任务），干多少”的口号，向东北全路挑战，他们把自己的调车组更名为“抗美援朝保家卫国生产小组”，以表示他们的战斗意志。铁牛运动的始祖——“铁牛号”机车，向全国模范机车旗帜——“毛泽东号”机车挑战，保证在第四季度任务中不出一切大小事故，超轴并正点运行。
    “一个人干两个人的活，两天的事一天干完。”
    东北铁路工人知道在抗美援朝保家卫国的伟大斗争中，迅速提高工作效率是极为重要的。沈阳铁路工人说：“今天我们要一个人干两个人的活，两天的事一天干完。”他们在火车头报上这样写道：“二百工来百工完，不漏汽来不回修；大家努力齐动手，要叫美帝走尽头。”他们想尽种种方法，以提高工作效率。齐齐哈尔机务段工人改进了劳动组织，使机车在库内上煤，上水和其他作业时间从一小时减至十六分钟；检车段在完成一次需时十二天的临时突击任务中，工人杨明春三天没有睡觉，在寒夜里，他独自爬在电线杆上，修电线，雪花落在他的衣服上，雪水浸透了棉衣，他始终没有停止修线工作。由于这样的艰苦努力，该段在五天内就完成了十二天的突击任务。通化车站的工人连夜奔忙，有四十五个职工昼夜装货，使得该站十月份装车任务在二十五日那天就超过了百分之四百。郑家屯机务段青年技术人员李高田刻苦努力，创造了一台切断机，使生产效率提高了八十倍。本溪机务段司机张明海经常超轴七百吨完成运转任务。
    “多省一块煤，多打死一个美国侵略军。”
    “在抗美援朝斗争中，更要注意节约。”这是他们的口号，他们说：“多省一块煤，多打死一个美国侵略军。”图们检车段工人在工余的时间里，就出外搜集材料，至今他们已搜集了价值八亿三千余万东北币的车辆器材。每个段、站和生产小组在竞赛的条件里，都把节约摆在很重要的位置，“铁牛号”机车竞赛的主要内容就是：“保证每月节省百分之十的用煤和百分之二十的混合油；厉行经济核算，每日按所使用的成本节省百分之三十。”一年来，东北铁路机车的用煤节省了十三万二千吨，但他们并不满足：“在抗美援朝斗争中，我们还要加强节约！”
