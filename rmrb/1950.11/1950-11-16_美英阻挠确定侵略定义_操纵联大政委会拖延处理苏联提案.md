　　US and Britain Obstruct Definition of Aggression
    Manipulate UN Political Committee to Delay Handling of Soviet Proposal
    [Xinhua News Agency, 15th] (Combined Tass News Agency, New York) The United Nations General Assembly Political Committee held consecutive meetings on November 9th and 10th.

    The meeting on the 9th continued to discuss the Soviet proposal on defining aggression regarding the issue of "obligations of states when war breaks out." Representatives from Ecuador, Syria, Bolivia, Egypt, Chile, and other countries acknowledged the importance of the Soviet proposal but advocated submitting it to the UN International Law Commission for long-term study. Representatives from the US, Britain, France, and other countries fundamentally opposed the Soviet proposal and advocated handing it over to the illegal "Little Assembly," attempting to bury the issue of defining aggression.

    Soviet representative Zarubin spoke against submitting the Soviet proposal to the International Law Commission or the illegal "Little Assembly," insisting that a decision should be made in the Political Committee. Zarubin said: Many representatives have already recognized that the issue of defining aggression is of great importance. The task of the United Nations is to stop aggression. This first requires defining aggression. Therefore, the Soviet proposal is fulfilling the task of the United Nations. Representatives from Ukraine, Czechoslovakia, and Poland also spoke, requesting the passage of the Soviet proposal.

    However, the majority voting machine in the Political Committee passed the joint proposal of Syria and Bolivia to submit the Soviet proposal to the International Law Commission.

    The Political Committee then discussed the Yugoslav proposal to establish a so-called "Permanent Conciliation Committee" to assist in the peaceful settlement of international disputes.

    Soviet representative Zarubin, speaking on the 10th, pointed out that the Yugoslav proposal seriously violated the UN Charter and was one in a series of attempts to undermine the Security Council because the powers granted to the so-called "Permanent Conciliation Committee" in the proposal were the powers of the Security Council.

    The representatives of the US-British bloc countries, on the one hand, dared not openly support the Yugoslav proposal, but on the other hand, disregarding the opposition of the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries, relied on a majority to pass a resolution referring the Yugoslav proposal to the illegal "Little Assembly" for consideration.

　　美英阻挠确定侵略定义
    操纵联大政委会拖延处理苏联提案
    【新华社十五日讯】综合塔斯社纽约讯：联合国大会政治委员会十一月九日、十日连续举行会议。
    九日会议继续讨论苏联关于“战争爆发时各国所负义务”问题所提出的确定侵略定义的提案。厄瓜多尔、叙利亚、玻利维亚、埃及、智利等国代表承认苏联提案的重要性，但主张把它提交联大国际法委员会长期研究。美、英、法等国代表根本反对苏联提案，而主张把它交予非法的“小型联大”，企图借此埋葬侵略定义问题。
    苏联代表查鲁宾发言反对将苏联提案提交国际法委员会或非法的“小型联大”，坚持应在政治委员会中作出决定。查鲁宾说：许多代表已经承认侵略定义问题是具有很大的重要性的。联合国的任务就是制止侵略。这首先就要确定侵略的定义。所以苏联提案便是履行联合国的任务。乌克兰、捷克斯洛伐克、波兰代表也都发言要求通过苏联提案。
    但是，政治委员会内的多数表决机器却通过了叙利亚与玻利维亚所提将苏联提案交予国际法委员会的联合提案。
    政治委员会接着讨论南斯拉夫所提设立所谓“常设斡旋委员会”以协助和平解决国际争端的提案。
    苏联代表查鲁宾在十日发言时，指出南斯拉夫提案严重地违反联合国宪章，是一连串破坏安理会的企图之一，因为提案中授予所谓“常设斡旋委员会”的职权就是安理会的职权。
    美英集团国家代表一方面不敢公开支持南斯拉夫提案，另一方面却不顾苏联及人民民主国家的反对，凭借多数通过决议，将南斯拉夫这项提案交予非法的“小型联大”考虑。
