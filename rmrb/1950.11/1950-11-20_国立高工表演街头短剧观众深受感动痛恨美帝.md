The National Vocational School Performs Street Skits, Audience Deeply Moved and Hates American Imperialism
    [Reported by this newspaper] The National Vocational School propaganda team, on the 19th in the morning, still split into two groups and set off to promote [their message] in the fourth district. They performed a total of eight times, with an audience of more than 5,000 people. Among them, the most popular were the picture explanations and street skits, especially the short play adapted from "Put Down Your Whip," which was even more moving. Many audience members cried. An old lady wiped away her tears and said, "I hate the American devils so much, because I love my children!" The propaganda team was also deeply loved by the masses. For example, the owner of a dried fruit shop personally brought a large pot of water for the students to drink.

　　国立高工表演街头短剧观众深受感动痛恨美帝
    【本报讯】国立高工宣传队，十九日上午仍分两路，在四区出发宣传。共演出八次，观众有五千多人。其中最受欢迎的是图片解说和街头剧，尤其是《放下你的鞭子吧》改编的短剧，更为动人。好多观众都哭了，一个老太太抹着眼泪说：“我可恨死美国鬼子了，因为我爱我的孩子呀！”宣传队也受到了群众的热爱。如一个干果铺的掌柜的亲自提了一大壶水给同学们去喝。
