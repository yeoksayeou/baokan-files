　　Decision on Continuing to Strengthen and Develop the Work of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association
    (Passed by the First National Work Conference of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association on October 11, 1950)

    Over the past year, with the victorious development of the domestic and international situation, thanks to the cooperation of all parties and the efforts of all members, the Association has developed into a broad mass organization with more than three million members. It has done a lot of work and made great achievements in carrying out propaganda and education on Sino-Soviet friendship, promoting the movement to learn from the Soviet Union, introducing the situation of New China to the Soviet people, promoting the friendly relations between the Chinese and Soviet people, and participating in the peace signature campaign. However, there are still many shortcomings in our work in the past year. The most important of these is that the Friendship Associations at all levels have generally failed to refute in a timely manner the various anti-Soviet rumors and fallacies spread by the enemy, and have failed to fully understand the ideological situation of the masses, and systematically and fundamentally explain the various doubts about the relationship with the Soviet Union in the minds of the masses, and guide the masses to deeply understand the Soviet Union. In addition, the closed-doorism in our work of developing members, and the failure to promote and cooperate with various people's organizations, but to carry out work in isolation, are also quite common and serious biases in the Friendship Association organizations. At present, the overall situation and the construction of New China urgently require us to overcome the shortcomings in our work in a timely and serious manner, consolidate and develop the achievements we have already made, and further strengthen and develop the work of the Association, so as to further promote the exchange of wisdom and experience between the Chinese and Soviet people, enhance the great fighting friendship between the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union, so as to promote the construction of our country and safeguard world lasting peace. To this end, the following decisions are made:

    I. The Association is a broad united front mass organization with the purpose of enhancing and consolidating the brotherly friendship and cooperation between the people of China and the Soviet Union and promoting the exchange of all the wisdom and experience of the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union. Therefore, all Chinese people who enjoy civil rights, as long as they agree with the purpose of the Association, are willing to enhance Sino-Soviet friendship and learn from the Soviet Union, should be able to join the Association as members regardless of class, party affiliation, religious belief, or gender. Never regard the Friendship Association as just an organization of advanced elements, and never practice closed-doorism towards workers, peasants, or intellectuals. In developing members, on the one hand, we should face the working class, peasants and other laboring masses, and on the other hand, we should try our best to absorb people from literature, art, science, education and other fields to participate, and make them practically bear certain practical responsibilities and work, so that the members of the Association will develop to about 20 million by the end of 1951. The procedures for recruiting members should be as simple as possible. As long as they agree with the Articles of Association of the Association and sign the application form for membership, they can become members. In addition to individual members, group members can be accepted. All units of the People's Liberation Army join as group members, and no individual members are accepted. Trade unions, peasant associations, youth, women, students, and cultural, educational, and scientific organizations, and their grass-roots organizations (such as factories, organs, schools, townships, or villages) can join as group members, but they must be discussed by the members of the group, pass a written resolution, and truly voluntarily apply for membership before they can be accepted as group members. After joining the association, a Friendship Association committee or council is set up in its grass-roots organization to be responsible for carrying out Sino-Soviet friendship work. The Friendship Association organization should be broad and flexible, not too strict, and no member group life should be established. All organizational forms should be based on the principle of facilitating the propaganda and education work of Sino-Soviet friendship, internationalism and learning from the Soviet Union.

    II. The basic daily work of the Association is to educate the broad masses in the spirit of internationalism, enhance their understanding of the Soviet Union, and learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. Therefore, the Friendship Associations at all levels should, on the existing basis, do everything possible, use various forms, and combine the specific situation and central tasks of the time and place, to carry out such propaganda and education work in a deep and concrete manner. In particular, we should carefully understand and study the ideological trends of the people in various places, refute various anti-Soviet rumors and fallacies in a timely manner, correct narrow nationalist ideas, and starting from the ideas of scientific socialism and the Soviet socialist system, and combining the actual thinking of the masses, systematically and concretely explain various questions and concerns about the Soviet Union and Sino-Soviet friendship, so as to further consolidate the friendship of the broad masses with the Soviet Union ideologically. The General Association should concentrate the strength of some translators and compilers from various places to run the published "Sino-Soviet Friendship" magazine well, strengthen the work of introducing and studying the Soviet Union, and immediately prepare to publish Sino-Soviet Friendship Pictorial as an important tool for educating workers, peasants and other laboring masses. The publications published by the local Friendship Associations should be as popular as possible so that they can penetrate the working class and peasantry. The General Association and the branches should greatly strengthen the work of film, slide and picture exhibitions. On the one hand, they should strive to popularize them, and on the other hand, they should improve the quality to meet the requirements and levels of the broad masses. Localities should organize lectures, forums and broadcasts on Sino-Soviet friendship and learning from the Soviet Union in a more planned way, and apply great efforts to develop the work of learning Russian in a guided way, setting up Russian lectures in schools, organs, troops, groups and broadcasts, and training Russian talents, so as to facilitate learning from the Soviet Union and enhance Sino-Soviet friendship.

    III. The Association should more systematically introduce the struggles and construction achievements of the Chinese people to the Soviet people, such as organizing exhibitions, sending publications, organizing visiting delegations, etc. We should greatly strengthen the close ties between the workers, youth, women, peasants, and cultural and academic circles of China and the Soviet Union, and carry out mutual friendly correspondence movements.

    IV. The Friendship Associations at all levels should most actively participate in and promote the movement of the Chinese people to defend world peace, and in this movement, enhance the masses' understanding of the role of the Soviet Union as the leader of the world peace and democracy camp, and enhance their love for the Soviet people.

    V. The Friendship Associations at all levels must focus on promoting and helping various people's organizations to carry out the above-mentioned propaganda and education and the work of developing Friendship Association members. Do not isolate the Friendship Association into a narrow world. We must cooperate with the government, enterprises, groups, and schools in their own central tasks, and help them carry out specific work to enhance Sino-Soviet friendship and learn from the Soviet experience. Do not do the general work of the Friendship Association in a hollow and one-sided way. Only in this way can the work of Sino-Soviet friendship be fully developed and have a deep foundation. After this meeting, the General Association should immediately consult with the General Headquarters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the New Democratic Youth League, the All-China Youth Federation, the All-China Women's Federation, the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and other relevant organs and groups to work together to further enhance Sino-Soviet friendship, develop Friendship Association members and specific steps for Association affairs. Localities should also conduct consultations with all relevant parties in accordance with the same spirit, so as to pool efforts and effectively carry out work.

    VI. The Friendship Associations at all levels must conscientiously implement the mass line, rely on the masses to carry out work, and must fully rely on activists among the masses, and cultivate backbones from the broad masses of activists to become part-time cadres. On the other hand, it is necessary for Friendship Associations at all levels to have a number of full-time cadres. Therefore, the Association should have a certain establishment, which will be formulated by this meeting and submitted to the National Establishment Committee for review and implementation by the General Association. The Association's funds should gradually be self-sufficient by the members of the Association. Therefore, members should pay membership fees in accordance with the provisions of the Association's regulations, except in special circumstances. In places where conditions permit, donations can be made to members with better economic conditions based on the principle of voluntariness, in order to carry out Association affairs.

    VII. This decision shall be promulgated and implemented by the General Association after being approved by the President.

　　关于继续加强与发展中苏友好协会工作的决定
    （中苏友好协会第一次全国工作会议一九五○年十月十一日通过）
    一年来，随着国内外形势的胜利发展，由于各方的配合和全体会员的努力，本会已发展为拥有三百余万会员的广大群众性组织。并在进行中苏友好的宣传教育，推行学习苏联的运动，向苏联人民介绍新中国的情况，促进中苏两国人民的友谊关系，以及参加和平签名运动等方面，作了不少的工作，有了巨大的成就。但过去一年我们工作中还存在着很多的缺点。其中最主要的是各级友协一般地还没有作到及时地驳斥敌人所散布的各种反苏谣言和谬论，还没有作到充分了解群众的思想情况，并准对这种情况系统地并从基本上解释清楚群众思想中关于对苏联关系问题的各种疑虑，并引导群众去深刻地认识苏联。此外，在我们发展会员工作中的关门主义，和不推动与配合各人民团体而是孤立地去进行工作，也是各友协组织中相当普遍和严重的偏向。目前整个形势和新中国的建设迫切地要求我们及时和认真地克服我们工作中的缺点，巩固和发扬我们业已取得的成就，并进一步加强和发展本会的工作，以便更加促进中苏两国人民的智慧与经验的交流，增进中苏两大民族的伟大战斗的友谊，以推进我们国家的建设，保卫世界持久的和平。为此，特作如下决定：
    一、本会是以增进和巩固中苏两国人民兄弟般的友谊和合作、促进中苏两大民族的一切智慧和经验的交流为目的的广泛的统一战线的群众组织。因此，凡一切享有公民权的中国人民，只要他赞成本会宗旨、愿意增进中苏友好、学习苏联的，应不分阶级、党派、宗教信仰和性别，都可以参加本会为会员。决不要将友协看作只是先进分子的组织，决不要对工农群众或知识分子实行关门主义。发展会员一面应面向工农劳动群众，另一面应尽力吸收文艺、科学、教育及其他方面人士参加，并使他们切实地担负一定的实际责任和工作，作到在一九五一年底以前本会会员发展到二千万人左右。吸收会员手续应力求简单，只要他赞成本会章程并在入会志愿书上签名者，即可入会。除个人会员外，可吸收团体会员。人民解放军各单位均以团体会员资格入会，不吸收个人会员。工会、农会、青年、妇女、学生及文化教育科学团体、其基层组织（如工厂、机关、学校、乡或村）均可以团体会员资格入会，但必须经该团体成员开会讨论，通过书面决议，真正自愿申请入会者，才能被吸收为团体会员。入会后在其基层组织内设友协委员会或干事会，专负进行中苏友好工作之责。友协组织应广泛灵活，不要太严格，不要建立会员小组生活。一切组织形式以便利进行中苏友好、国际主义及学习苏联的宣传教育工作为原则。
    二、本会日常的基本工作，是以国际主义的精神的教育广大群众，增进他们对苏联的认识，学习苏联的先进经验。因此，各级友协应在现有基础上，尽一切可能，运用各种形式，结合当时当地的具体情况和中心任务，深入和具体地去进行此种宣传教育工作。特别应该用心地去了解和研究各地人民群众的思想动态，及时驳斥各种反苏谣言和谬论，纠正狭隘民族主义思想，从科学社会主义的思想和苏联社会主义的制度出发，结合群众思想的实际，系统地和具体地去解释各种有关苏联和中苏友好的疑问和顾虑，以便在思想上更加巩固广大群众对苏联的友谊。总会应集中各地一部分编译人员的力量办好已出版的《中苏友好》杂志，加强介绍和研究苏联的工作，并立即准备出版中苏友好画报作为教育工农劳动群众的重要工具。各地友协所出刊物应力求通俗，使之能深入工农群众。总会及各分会应大大加强电影、幻灯和图片展览工作，一面力求普及，一面应提高质量，适合广大群众的要求和水平。各地应当更有计划地组织关于中苏友好和学习苏联的讲演会、座谈会及广播，并应用极大力量有领导地去开展学习俄文的工作，在学校、机关、部队、团体及广播中设俄文讲座，培养俄文人才，以便利学习苏联，增进中苏友谊。
    三、本会应更有计划地向苏联人民介绍中国人民的斗争与建设成就的工作，如组织展览会、送出版物、组织访问团等，应大大加强中苏两国工人、青年、妇女、农民、文化学术界的亲密联系，开展相互友好通信运动。
    四、各级友协应最积极地参加和推动中国人民保卫世界和平的运动，并在此运动中提高群众对苏联作为世界和平民主阵营领导者的作用的认识，增进对苏联人民的友爱。
    五、各级友协必须着重地推动和帮助各人民团体，进行上述宣传教育和发展友协会员的工作。不要孤立地将友协划成狭窄的天地，必须配合政府、企业、团体、学校自己的中心任务，帮助他们进行具体的增进中苏友好和学习苏联经验的工作，不要空洞地片面地做友协的一般工作。只有这样，中苏友好的工作才能全面展开，并得到深厚的基础。此次会议后，总会应即与中国人民解放军总部、中华全国总工会、新民主主义青年团、全国民主青联、全国民主妇联、全国文联等有关机关团体协商共同努力进一步增进中苏友好、发展友协会员及会务的具体步骤，各地亦应根据同样精神，与各有关方面进行协商，以群策群力，有效地开展工作。
    六、各级友协必须切实实行群众路线，依靠群众来进行工作，必须充分依靠群众中的积极分子，并从广大积极分子中，培养骨干成为兼职干部。另一方面，各级友协设有若干专职干部是必要的，因此本会应有一定的编制，由本会议拟定，由总会提交全国编制委员会审定施行，本会经费应逐步地做到由会员群众自给。因此会员除特殊情形外，应照会章规定缴纳会费。在有条件的地方可向经济情况较好的会员，根据自愿原则，进行募捐。以开展会务。
    七、本决定经会长批准，由总会公布施行。
