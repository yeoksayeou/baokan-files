　　Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai: People from all democratic parties and all walks of life in East China have expressed their utter indignation at the crimes of the United States in expanding its war of aggression. They have expressed their opinions one after another, advocating for taking voluntary actions to assist the Korean people, defeat the American aggressors, and defend the motherland.
　　Su Yanbin, Peng Wenyin, and Chen Renbing of the Shanghai Branch of the China Democratic League, and Jin Xuecheng of the Shanghai Working Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association, all expressed their opinions, believing that only by vigorously assisting Korea with voluntary actions and giving the aggressors a severe blow can the crazy aggression of American imperialism be stopped and the independence and security of the country be guaranteed. Xiong Foxi, principal of the Shanghai Municipal Drama School, and actors Zhou Xinfang and Shi Hui, unanimously stated: Supporting the Korean people's war of liberation is equivalent to consolidating our own national defense. Yao Shukun, from the Shanghai cigarette industry, said: "We should recognize that today's American imperialism is the Japanese fascism of the 'September 18th' Incident. Therefore, we should heighten our vigilance, promote a high degree of patriotism and love for the nation, and support the Korean people's anti-American aggression war with practical and concrete actions."
　　Ling Zhenghua and Zhang Weigang, readers of the Liberation Daily, submitted letters to the newspaper expressing their willingness to participate in the great and just war of resisting America and aiding Korea.
　　Workers, young students, and medical workers in Nanjing have successively put forward demands and propositions to resist America, aid Korea, protect their homes, and defend the country. Ge Zengkun, a representative who attended the National Model Workers Conference, said: "We must immediately extinguish the flames of American imperialist aggression like putting out a fire. In order to defend the motherland, our entire clothing factory guarantees to support all the military clothing needs of the anti-aggression war with the greatest strength." All members of Li Jinhua's group of the Jinling University Youth League unanimously expressed their willingness to dedicate all their strength. Doctors and nurses from the Municipal First Hospital have successively expressed their willingness to dedicate their strength to defend the motherland and oppose American imperialist aggression.
　　In Shandong, Liu Qingxiang, Luo Shufang, and others who had attended the National Model Heroes Conference, enthusiastically responded to the national movement of volunteering to aid Korea and protect the homes and defend the country. They called on all workers to continue to carry out production competitions and use practical actions to combat American imperialist aggression. Liu Qingxiang guaranteed that their factory would produce forty-five waterwheels every month to supply farmers with increased grain production. Sun Shaocheng, an old employee of the Jinan Telecommunications Bureau in his fifties, said: The United States is following the path of Japanese aggression against China. There is a precedent for failure, let him follow this dead end. Members of the Shandong Provincial Youth League School of the China New Democratic Youth League submitted seventy-nine letters to the newspaper in one day, unanimously expressing their desire to go to the front line and extinguish the flames of American imperialist aggression. Militiamen in various villages in Shandong are discussing how to practice martial arts and learn marksmanship in order to resist America, aid Korea, protect their homes, and defend the country. Fan Weiming, a militiaman from Hujiazhuang, Licheng, held his Type 38 rifle tightly and said: "The fate of the Japanese devils is the fate of the Americans." When farmers throughout the province heard that American imperialism had invaded our national border, they quickly paid their autumn public grain. The two villages of Xiliuquan and Shixia in Boshan County, with a total of 231 households, transported grain at night with lanterns. They said that this was to strengthen the country's power in order to resist American imperialist aggression.
　　In southern Anhui, Hu Shanfu, an industrial model worker who attended the National Model Workers Conference, firmly expressed his willingness to resist America and aid Korea. He said, "I can drive cars, repair cars, and I can also make guns and cannons. I am always prepared to do everything in my power to help the Korean brothers." Many members of farmers' associations have expressed their determination to resist America and aid Korea. Xia Shuncai, a farmer association member in his fifties from Zhangjiashan Village in the suburbs of Wuhu City, said angrily: The American devils are bullying us at our doorstep. If we do not help Korea, we cannot produce with peace of mind. We must not give in to American imperialism. We have already wiped out one Japanese empire, and if another American empire comes, we will definitely be able to wipe it out too! The 107 student representatives from major middle schools in Wuhu City, who are attending the student representative meeting, said indignantly: Only by taking practical actions to resist America, aid Korea, and defend the motherland, and eliminate the American imperialist aggressors, can we have a quiet environment to study.
　　Gu Jiusheng, a model worker at the Datong Coal Mine in Huaibei, Anhui, wrote to the Huaibei Daily saying: If a mad dog bites, we must break its dog legs. Feng Xuran, a model worker in northern Anhui who attended the National Congress of Labor, Peasant and Soldier Model Workers, called on workers to step up production and create new records in order to resist American aggression with practical actions. The workers of the Bengbu Power Plant decided to save coal, ensure safe power generation and supply, and protect machinery to increase the strength of the motherland. The workers of the plant unanimously believe that American imperialism is a paper tiger, and its paper skin must be peeled off. Its fate will be exactly the same as Hitler's. All commanders and fighters of the Anhui Military Region of the People's Liberation Army are extremely indignant at the frenzied aggression of American imperialism against Korea and the serious threat to our country's security. He Zhucheng, Deputy Director of the Political Department of the Military Region, called on all soldiers to strengthen their fighting will, actively suppress bandits, eliminate secret agents, and organize and develop a large number of militias to oppose American imperialist aggression.

    在皖南，曾出席全国劳模代表会议的工业模范胡善甫坚决表示抗美援朝的志愿，他说：“我会开汽车，修汽车，我也会造枪炮，我时时刻刻准备，尽我的一切力量援助朝鲜兄弟。”许多农会会员都纷纷表示抗美援朝的决心。芜湖市郊区张家山村的一个五十多岁的农会会员夏顺才激愤的说：美国鬼子欺侮到我们大门口上来了，如果不援助朝鲜，我们就不能安心生产。我们对美帝决不能让步。我们已经消灭了一个日本帝国，再来一个美国帝国，我们也一定能把它消灭掉！正参加学生代表会的芜湖市各大中学的一百零七个学生代表，愤慨地表示：只有实际行动起来抗美援朝，保卫祖国，消灭美帝侵略者，才能有安静的环境读书。
    皖北淮南煤矿大通矿厂劳动模范谷九胜写信给皖北日报说：疯狗咬来了，我们一定要打断它的狗腿。出席全国工农兵劳模代表大会的皖北劳动模范酆绪然号召工人们加紧生产，创造新纪录，以实际行动来反抗美国侵略。蚌埠电力厂的工人们则决定节省燃煤，保证安全发电、供电和保护机器来增加祖国的力量。该厂工人们一致认为美帝是一只纸老虎，一定要把它的纸皮剥下来。它的命运一定和希特勒一模一样。人民解放军皖北军区全体指战员，对美帝疯狂侵略朝鲜并严重威胁我国安全，无不异常愤慨。军区政治部副主任何柱成号召全体战士加强战斗意志，积极剿匪，肃清特务，大量组织和发展民兵，反对美帝的侵略。
