Beijing Agricultural University, after a week of current affairs study and intense preparation, conducted three days of rural propaganda work from the 20th to the 22nd. The night before going to the countryside, they invited responsible comrades from the 13th District to the school to give a report.

During the propaganda process, the rural education work station in the village played a huge role. Based on the rural work of the work station, the propaganda was able to proceed smoothly.

During the three days of propaganda activities, the students demonstrated a high degree of enthusiasm and creativity. As soon as the first brigade arrived in the village, they beat gongs and drums, gathering all the men, women, old and young in the village to the venue to watch the program performances. The third brigade imitated the "goat urinating" method, walking a section, gathering a group of people, leaving a few students here to do propaganda, and the brigade in front would gather the masses in this way again. Thus, small meetings were held all over the village from east to west and from south to north. In more scattered villages, the propaganda team held meetings of three or five families. In this way, the propaganda can be extensive and in-depth.

Another group of students used skits, comic dialogues, Henan opera, peep shows, waist drums, yangko dances, and ditties to conduct general propaganda to the masses in the morning. In the afternoon, they were divided into groups of three to five people, accompanied by the village head, to visit farmers' homes. In the past three days, more than 1,230 families were visited. The farmers treated the visiting students like relatives. Through this method of family visits, the students widely and deeply explained various issues to the farmers. The students also learned a lot of agricultural knowledge from the farmers.

Through the three days of propaganda, more than 16,200 farmers generally had a preliminary understanding of American imperialism. At the symposiums held by each team on the evening of the 22nd, Zhang Dianda said: "American devils are the same as Japanese devils, they are all bad guys!" Wang Guoxiang said: "We will never let the American devils come again!" The farmers also wanted to support the Korean front line with practical actions such as paying public grain, working hard in production, not believing rumors, and responding to the government's call. Some farmers also asked to join the volunteer army to resolutely strike at American imperialism.

　　北京农大运用各种方法
    深入农村宣传时事
    【本报讯】北京农业大学，经过了一周的时事学习和紧张准备，于二十日到二十二日进行了三天的农村宣传工作。下乡前一夜，请十三区负责同志到校作了报告。
    在宣传过程中，该村农村教育工作站发挥了巨大的作用。在工作站农村工作的基础上，宣传得以顺利展开。
    三天的宣传活动，同学们表现了高度的积极性和创造性。第一大队一到村子，即敲锣打鼓，聚集了全村男女老少到会场来看节目表演。第三大队仿效“山羊拉尿”的办法，走一段，聚一堆人，留下几个学生在这里宣传，前边大队再这样聚集群众。于是全村从东到西，从南到北，都在开小会。在较分散的庄子，宣传队就召开三家、五家的片会。这样宣传就能广泛而深入。
    另一部分学生，上午用活报剧、相声、河南梆子、拉洋片、腰鼓、秧歌、小调等方式向群众进行一般性的宣传。下午分为三人到五人的小组，由闾长伴同到农家进行访问。三天来，共访问了一千二百三十多家。农民们都亲人一般地招待来访问的学生。通过这种家庭访问的方式，学生们广泛而深入地给农民解释了各项问题。学生们也向农民学习了许多农业知识。
    通过三天的宣传，一万六千二百多农民普遍对美帝有了初步认识。在二十二日晚间各队分别召开的座谈会上，张殿大说：“美国鬼子和日本鬼子一样，都是坏蛋！”王国相说：“我们决不让美国鬼子再来！”农民们并且要用缴公粮，努力生产，不信谣言，响应政府号召等实际行动来支援朝鲜前线。有一些农民并要求参加志愿军，坚决打击美帝。
