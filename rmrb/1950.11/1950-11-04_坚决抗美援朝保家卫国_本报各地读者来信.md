　　Resolutely Resist America and Aid Korea, Defend Our Homes and Defend Our Country
    ——Letters from Readers Across the Country to This Newspaper
    Turn Anger into Steel Strength
    Crush the Imperialist Aggression of the U.S.! Editor:
    American imperialism has expanded its war of aggression against Korea, and the flames of war have spread to our borders. The wicked American imperialists dare to be enemies of peace-loving people. They want to disrupt our production and destroy our happy and joyful lives. But we must stop them.
    We are determined to take practical actions to crush the aggressive crimes of the American imperialists, turn our anger into steel-like will, and resolutely eliminate them!
    We must also heighten our vigilance, strengthen our three-prevention work, and wage a resolute and thorough struggle against reactionaries who sabotage and spread rumors!
    We are determined to mobilize all our strength to resolutely defend production, improve quality, increase output, eliminate waste products, reduce costs, and complete our tasks ahead of schedule, to fight to the end for the lasting peace of our country and the world!
　　　　　　　Northeast Ma Hengchang Group (entire membership)
    Confident in the Great Power of the People
    Will Surely Crush the Aggression of American Imperialism! Editor:
    Recently, American imperialism, under the banner stolen from the United Nations, sent its own troops and those of its vassal states to invade Korea. The American troops invading Korea dared to approach our northeastern border and expand their war of aggression. We, the Chinese people, will never allow such aggression by American imperialism. Foreign Minister Zhou has lodged a serious protest, which we firmly support.
    The aggressive acts of American imperialism are, of course, not limited to this. For example, while invading Korea, it sent warships to prevent us from liberating Taiwan, and American planes have continuously invaded our northeastern airspace, bombing and strafing, all of which are facts of aggression.
    The aggressive face of American imperialism has long been recognized by the Chinese people and the people of the world. The people of the world should unite and use the power of peace to oppose the aggressive policies of American imperialism. I am confident that the great power of the people will surely crush the aggressive schemes of American imperialism.
    Now we, the Chinese people, must be even more vigilant. Although the Kuomintang reactionaries are on the verge of extinction, they are not reconciled to failure and are using secret agents to undermine our peaceful construction efforts. We, the working class, must realize that we are the leading class in China, the masters of the country. We must take practical actions to actively produce, consolidate our national defense, and build our new China into a prosperous and strong country to resist the aggression of imperialism.

    The Aggressive Actions of American Imperialism Are Endless
    Our People Must Give It a Serious Blow! Editor:
    We have seen that American imperialism has openly occupied our Taiwan, and then launched a large-scale invasion of Korea, and has endlessly provoked China, barbarously bombing our northeastern territory and peace-loving people. In particular, recently, the flames of aggression of American imperialism have burned to the border of our motherland, directly threatening our safety. All postal workers in the Business Section of the Beijing Postal Administration unanimously believe that the aggressive actions of American imperialism are endless. Now that our peaceful and democratic Chinese people have stood up, we will never again be subjected to any aggression or threat from any imperialists. We must take immediate action to directly assist our class brothers in Korea and resolutely give the invaders a devastating blow!
　　　　　　　　　　All Postal Workers in the Business Section of the Beijing Postal Administration
    Tricycle Workers Firmly Declare
    Smash the American Imperialist Troops Invading Korea! Editor:
    American imperialism and its vassal states are using airplanes and artillery to invade our neighbor, Korea. We feel indescribable anger and cannot sit idly by. We must join the Korean people to defeat the American aggressors and absolutely must not allow the flag of imperialism to be planted on our border, causing panic among the people of the whole country.
　　　　　　　　　　Tricycle Workers of Group One, Second District, Beijing
    Redouble Our Efforts to Do a Good Job in Our Nursery Work
    Let the Parents of the Children Be Able to Resist American Imperialism with Peace of Mind! Editor:
    We firmly support Foreign Minister Zhou's statement and put forward the following requirements and guarantees:
    1. We demand a serious rebuff to the American imperialists who are invading our neighbor Korea and continuing to expand their war of aggression. We cannot tolerate the imperialists' aggression against our brother countries, their obstruction of the liberation of our territory Taiwan, and their repeated provocations against our airspace and territorial waters!
    2. We suggest that comrades working in various factories should produce more to provide material assistance to Korea.
    3. We are determined to redouble our efforts to ensure that we do a good job in our nursery work, fulfill our responsibility to nurture and educate children, so that the fathers and mothers of all children can work with peace of mind to resist American imperialism.

　　坚决抗美援朝保家卫国
    ——本报各地读者来信
    把愤怒化为钢铁力量
    粉碎美帝的侵略暴行编辑同志：
    美帝扩大侵朝战争，并已将战争火焰延烧到我国边境了。万恶的美帝竟敢与爱好和平的人民为敌。它想搅乱我们的生产，破坏我们的幸福、愉快的生活。但是，我们一定要制止它。
    我们决以实际行动来粉碎美帝国主义者的侵略暴行，把愤怒化为钢铁般的意志，坚决消灭它！
    我们更要提高警惕，加强三防工作，与破坏、散布谣言的反动分子作坚决彻底的斗争！
    我们决动员一切力量坚决保卫生产，提高质量，增加产量，消灭废品，降低成本，提前完成任务，为祖国和世界的持久和平而奋斗到底！
          东北马恒昌小组全体
    确信人民的伟大力量
    定能粉碎美帝的侵略编辑同志：
    最近美帝盗用联合国旗帜，派遣了自己及其附庸国的军队，侵略朝鲜。侵朝美军竟敢逼近我国东北边境，扩大侵略战争。美帝这种侵略行为，我们中国人民是坚决不能许可的。周外长已提出严重抗议，我们是坚决拥护的。
    美帝的侵略行为当然不止这一点。如在侵朝同时，派遣军舰阻止我解放台湾，美机又不断侵入我国东北领空，并投弹、扫射，这都是侵略的事实。
    美帝的侵略面目，已早为我国人民以及全世界人民认清了。全世界人民应该团结起来，用和平力量反对美帝的侵略政策。我确信人民的伟大力量，一定能粉碎美帝的侵略阴谋。
    现在我中国人民更要警惕。国民党反动派虽眼看就要灭亡，但它还不甘心失败，利用特务来破坏我们的和平建设事业。我们工人阶级要觉悟到，我们是中国的领导阶级，是国家的主人。我们要以实际行动积极生产，巩固我们的国防，把我们新中国建设成为富强的国家，来抵抗帝国主义的侵略。
            工业劳模  骆淑芳
    美帝的侵略行为是无休止的
    我们人民要给它严重的打击编辑同志：
    我们看到了美帝公开的侵占了我国的台湾之后，又大举进军公开的侵略朝鲜，并无休止的屡向中国挑衅，野蛮的轰炸我东北的国土，和爱好和平的人民。特别是近来，美帝的侵略火焰已燃烧到我祖国的边疆，直接威胁我们的安全。我们北京邮政管理局业务科全体邮工一致认为，美帝的侵略行为，是无休止的。当我们和平民主的中国人民已站立起来了的今天，绝不再受任何帝国主义者的丝毫侵略和威胁。我们要立即行动起来，直接援助朝鲜的自己阶级的弟兄，坚决给侵犯者以歼灭性的打击！
          北京邮政管理局业务科全体邮工
    三轮工人坚决表示
    打垮侵朝美帝军队编辑同志：
    美帝和它的附庸国用飞机和大炮侵略我们的邻邦朝鲜，我们感到有说不出的愤怒，绝不能坐视不理。我们要与朝鲜人民共同来打垮美国侵略者，绝对不能叫帝国主义的旗子插在我国边境，使得全国人民恐慌不安。
        京市二区一群三轮工人
    加倍努力做好我们的保育工作
    让儿童们的爹妈安心反抗美帝编辑同志：
    我们坚决拥护周外长的声明，提出以下的要求和保证：
    一、要求对侵略我们邻邦朝鲜，并继续扩大侵略战争的美帝国主义给以严重的回击。我们不能容忍帝国主义对我们兄弟国家的侵略，及对我们的领土台湾解放的阻挠，对我们的领空领海的一再挑衅的行为！
    二、建议各个工厂工作的同志要多多生产，以物资援助朝鲜。
    三、我们决心加倍努力保证做好我们的保育工作，尽我保育教育儿童的责任，使各个儿童的爸爸妈妈能安心去作反抗美帝国主义的工作。
