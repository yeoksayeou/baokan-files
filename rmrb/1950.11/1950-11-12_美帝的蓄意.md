U.S. Imperialism's Deliberate Scheme
　　Xiao Qian

　　These past few days, due to work, I've been flipping through the materials from the 1945 United Nations conference in San Francisco. Comparing them to MacArthur's bestial behavior on Korean soil, a series of hateful things came to mind, all illustrating that the U.S. imperialists' attempt to use the United Nations to achieve their own desires has been a long-standing and deliberate scheme. Here is a small story.

　　In 1945, I traveled from the German front to the United States to cover the San Francisco conference. During the conference, although the Nazis had surrendered, the flames of Japanese imperialist aggression were still burning on the Chinese mainland.

　　One day, the conference press office notified reporters from all countries to go to San Francisco Bay to see an "airshow." Everyone was feeling a bit tired from traveling between the hotel and the opera house (the conference venue) every day. Therefore, most reporters were attracted by the idea of "San Francisco Bay" – few were particularly interested in the "airshow." It was in that mood that I decided to participate.

　　The cars took us to a pier. From there, we boarded a ship similar to those sailing on the Yangtze River and sailed out to the bay.

　　The sky was clear. The sea surface was as smooth and soft as silk. The ship sailed far out of the harbor, out of sight of land, and I suddenly remembered that I was floating on the Pacific Ocean. I quickly climbed to the top deck to look out – as if I could see the coastline of my homeland on the horizon.

　　As I was looking, suddenly, with a buzzing sound, a group of planes appeared in the sky. The sun was so strong that I tilted my head back to look closely, only seeing a cluster of ants crawling across the blue sky.

　　At this moment, someone on the ship reported through a loudspeaker: "Ladies and gentlemen, we now have two hundred U.S. aircraft of various types overhead, carrying various types of bombs (at that time, the atomic bomb had not yet been released – it was probably not yet completed), attacking our ship." Then, they added: "Please don't worry, the bombs are fake."

　　The words were drowned out by the sound of the airplane engines. One by one, the planes swooped down on us, wings tilted. Then, "bombs" fell all around the ship, splashing water more than ten feet high.

　　People on the deck screamed. The loudspeaker introduced the planes like it was reporting a horse race: "This is the P-42 type, specially transferred back from the Iwo Jima base, it has shot down seventeen enemy aircraft. It specializes in giving enemies a taste of hell!"

　　Suddenly, another group of fighter planes flew in from the side. This time they flew so low that they almost touched the ship's mast, so low that we could see the pilots wearing goggles.

　　Another batch of "bombs," a splash of water, and another burst of boasting from the loudspeaker. The announcer often used phrases like "This big guy is amazing!" or "Wow, its firepower is better than hell!" as if threatening: Whoever doesn't listen, we'll fly these big guys to their country!

　　Back at the hotel, many reporters felt annoyed. Some even smiled wryly and said: Americans are all about excitement. They spend a lot of money to watch two locomotives crash into each other. That's the secret of American newspaper editors. Today, they're offering a first-class thrill to their guests, it's just that we reporters don't appreciate it!

　　In fact, it was more than just excitement; it was a barbaric demonstration to the allied countries! The time was spring 1945. The U.S. imperialists actually used the opportunity to prepare for a post-war international cooperative organization to flaunt their killing skills. This despicable act truly tarnished the ideal of human peace, proving that the U.S. imperialists had already deliberately controlled the organization before the United Nations Charter was even signed, and were prepared to enslave the world with bloody weapons.

　　美帝的蓄意
　　萧乾
    这两天，因为工作关系，我翻了翻一九四五年联合国在旧金山开会的材料。对照着麦克阿瑟在朝鲜国土上所做的禽兽行为，我一连串想起了好几件可恨的事，都说明美国帝国主义挟联合国以随其己欲的企图是蓄意已久的。这里是一个小小的故事。
    为了采访旧金山大会，一九四五年我由德国前线赶到了美国。在开会期间，纳粹虽然投降了，日本帝国主义的侵略火焰却还在中国大陆上燃烧着。
    有一天，大会记者招待处通知所有各国记者赴旧金山港外去看“飞机表演”。天天往来于旅馆与歌剧院（大会会场）间，大家也都感到了些疲倦。因此，大部分记者都为“旧金山港外”所吸引——很少人对“飞机表演”有怎样浓厚的兴趣。我便是在那样心情下决定参加的。
    汽车把我们载到一个码头。由那里，我们上了类似航行在长江上的一只轮船驶到港外去。
    天是晴朗的。海面平滑细柔得像绸子。船航到不见岸的港外，我忽然记起自己是飘在太平洋上了。赶紧钻到船顶甲板上去了望——直好像在天际线上可以望到祖国海岸似的。
    正这样望着，突然，嗡嗡地，天空出现了一片机群。太阳照射得实在太强烈了，我仰起头来细望，只望到蓝天上爬着一簇蚂蚁。
    这时，船上有人在扩音机里报告说：“各位太太先生们，现在我们头顶上有二百架各种类型的美国飞机，载着各种类型的炸弹（那时原子弹还未拿出——大约也还未完成），向我们这条船进攻。”随着又补充说：“请别耽心，炸弹是假的。”
    话未广播完，就被飞机的马达声音压下去了。一架架飞机，斜着翅膀向我们俯冲下来。随着，船的四周都落了“弹”，把水溅起丈多高。
    甲板上的人惊叫着。扩音机像报告赛马般介绍着：“这是刚从硫磺岛基地特别调回来的Ｐ四二型，它已打下过十七架敌人的飞机。它专擅于给敌人地狱受！”
    忽然，由侧面又飞来一群战斗机。这回低飞得险些碰到船的桅杆，低得我们可以望到戴风镜的驾驶员。
    又是一批“弹”，一片水花，扩音器里又是一阵吹牛。
    大家本打算到港外赏赏太平洋的风光，这样被俯冲侧击了近四十分钟，一个个却溅得如落水鸡。耳朵里嗡嗡着罗旋桨声，扩音器里的吹牛声。报告者时常用“这个大家伙可了不起！”或“吓，它的火力胜过地狱！”一类字句。好像恫吓着说：谁不听话，就把这些大家伙开到谁国去！
    回到旅馆来，记者们很多都感到气恼。有人还苦笑说：美国人就讲究刺激。他们花大钱去看两架火车头互撞。这就是美国报纸编辑的秘诀。今天，他们是拿出头等的刺激来飨客了，只是我们这群记者不识味！
    其实，那不止是刺激，那是对于盟国们野蛮的示威！时间是一九四五年春天。美国帝国主义竟利用战后国际合作组织的筹建机会，来炫耀它的杀人本领，这种卑劣手段实在玷辱了人类的和平理想，证明美国帝国主义在联合国宪章还没签署时，便已蓄意把持这个组织，并且准备用血淋淋的武器来奴役世界了。
