Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, 22nd Dispatch: The Second World Peace Congress continued its discussions on the morning of the 20th. Chairman Dąbrowski (Poland) announced that due to the large number of representatives requesting to speak, the congress would hold three plenary sessions today.

　　When Park Jung-ae, the representative of the heroic Korean people, stepped onto the stage to speak, the participating representatives greeted her with warm cheers.

　　At the meeting, the French delegation submitted a proposal stating that in some countries, war economy is crowding out and expanding at the expense of peace economy, increasing the danger of war. The Second World Peace Congress should recommend to the parliaments of all countries that they pass laws to limit income derived from war preparations.

　　American black representative, Progressive Party member Howard, vehemently criticized the speech made by American representative Roach the previous day. He said: We can assure the conference that Roach does not represent the American Progressive Party, nor does he represent the American delegation. Although he is a member of our Standing Committee, he has made no practical contribution to the preparation of the conference. Howard then reported on the situation of black people in the United States, pointing out that they are fighting for peace, for their status, and for the basic improvement of the situation of oppressed peoples around the world. Howard's speech won warm applause. Representatives in the hall stood in solemn respect, while the American representatives sang the revolutionary songs sung by North American sergeants during the American Emancipation of Slaves War. In the afternoon meeting, Liu Ningyi, the Chinese representative, delivered a speech.

　　Yugoslavian People's Representative Popiwoda delivered a lengthy speech, describing the growing situation of the peace movement in Yugoslavia. Yugoslav patriots and peace fighters are preventing the transportation of military supplies, expanding the collection of signatures for peace, and exposing Tito's military adventures to the people. The representative of Luxembourg then spoke, declaring that the people of Luxembourg fully supported Joliot-Curie's report. The Brazilian representative reported on how the Brazilian people forced the government to withdraw its heroic action of sending 20,000 young people to Korea for a war of aggression. Representatives from the Soviet Union, the United States, Belgium, and Syria also spoke at today's meeting.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, 22nd Dispatch: At the morning meeting of the Second World Peace Congress on the 20th, Park Jung-ae, the representative of the heroic Korean people, delivered a moving speech.

　　Park Jung-ae said: "The Korean people have always loved peace. Even in the days of suffering under the yoke of foreigners, they have never lost confidence in their own strength. The Korean people firmly believe that their just cause will eventually be victorious because they have the support of peace-loving people from all countries around the world, led by the Soviet Union. The Korean people have close neighbors who are helping them, namely the 475 million Chinese people." Her words were interrupted by prolonged applause from the entire audience. Among the many moving events of suffering Korean people taking the road to struggle recounted by Park Jung-ae, one brought tears to the mothers at the conference. She said: When American planes barbarously bombed Pyongyang, a young woman carried a child on her back, but she did not know that the child's head had been blown off by an American bomb. No one had the courage to tell her until she went to breastfeed the child and found out. This young woman joined the guerrillas that day. Tens of thousands of women in Korea, like her, have lost their children, and they must demand blood debt from the American aggressors.

　　Park Jung-ae concluded by saying: "Let the American colonialists remember that the Korean people will never forgive the bloody crimes they have committed on Korean territory. The fire of hatred of the Korean people towards the American aggressors will never be extinguished. Let the people of the world hear the voice of the Korean people here: All the Korean people, united around General Kim Il-sung, vow to defend every inch of their motherland and resist the foreign aggressors and their lackey Syngman Rhee whom they hate."

　　As soon as Park Jung-ae finished her speech, she was immediately surrounded by the boiling crowd. Female representatives from China and many other countries rushed forward to embrace and kiss her. Flowers, gifts, and badges were constantly thrown in front of her. Many people were moved to tears. The hall resounded with cheers of "Long live Kim Il-sung" and "Long live the Korean people."

　　二届世界和大继续热烈进行讨论
    朝鲜代表朴正爱发表动人演说 
    全场热烈向她欢呼，许多人为之感动得流下热泪。
    【新华社二十二日讯】综合塔斯社华沙消息：第二届世界保卫和平大会二十日上午继续进行讨论。主席但布夫斯基（波兰）宣布：由于很多代表要求发言，大会今日将举行三次全体会议。
    当英雄的朝鲜人民代表朴正爱登台发言时，与会代表们报以热烈的欢呼。
    会上，法国代表团提出一项提案称：在某些国家里，战争经济正在排挤和平经济而扩张，增强了战争的危险。第二届世界保卫和平大会应向各国议会建议，请它们通过法律，限制由于进行战争准备而获得的收入。
    美国黑人代表，进步党党员何华德在发言时，猛烈抨击了前一日美国代表罗奇的发言。他说：我们可以向大会保证，罗奇并不代表美国进步党，也不代表美国代表团说话。虽然他是我们常设委员会的委员，但他对于大会的筹备工作没有任何实际贡献。何华德继报告了美国黑人的境况，指出他们正为争取和平，争取他们的地位和全世界被压迫民族的境况的基本改善而斗争。何华德的演说博得了热烈的掌声。会场代表都肃然起立，美国代表们则高唱美国解放黑奴战争时代的北美军士所唱的革命歌曲。在下午的会议上，中国代表刘宁一发表了演说。
    南斯拉夫人民代表波皮沃达发表了长篇演说，讲述了南斯拉夫保卫和平运动日益壮大的情形。南斯拉夫的爱国者、和平战士正阻止军需品的运输，扩大征集和平签名，并向人民揭露铁托的军事冒险。卢森堡代表继起发言，他声言卢森堡人民全力支持约里奥—居里的报告。巴西代表报告了巴西人民如何迫使政府撤消派遣两万青年赴朝鲜进行侵略战争的英勇行动。在本日会议上发言的尚有苏联、美国、比利时和叙利亚的代表。
    【新华社华沙二十二日电】在第二届世界保卫和平大会二十日上午会议上，英雄的朝鲜人民代表朴正爱发表了动人的演说。
    朴正爱说：“朝鲜人民一向热爱和平。虽在外国人的枷锁下受苦难的日子里，也从未丧失对自己力量的信心。朝鲜人民坚信他们的正义事业终将获得胜利，因为他们得到了以苏联为首的全世界各国爱好和平人民的支持。朝鲜人民有着援助他们的亲密的邻居，这就是四万七千五百万中国人民。”她的话被全场经久不息的欢呼所打断。朴正爱讲述受害的朝鲜人民走向斗争的许多动人事件中，有一件使大会上的母亲们流下了眼泪。她说：当美国飞机野蛮地轰炸平壤的时候，有一位年青妇女背上背着一个孩子，自己却不知道这个孩子的头已经被美国的炸弹炸掉了。当时没有人有勇气去告诉她，直到她去给孩子喂奶的时候才发觉。这个年青妇女就在这一天参加了游击队。朝鲜有成千成万的妇女都像她一样丧失了孩子，她们都要向美国侵略者讨还血债。
    朴正爱最后说：“让美国殖民主义者记住：朝鲜人民决不会饶恕他们在朝鲜领土上所犯的血腥罪行。朝鲜人民对美国侵略者的憎恨之火是永远不会熄灭的。让全世界人民都听见朝鲜人民在这里发出的声音：团结在金日成将军周围的全体朝鲜人民，誓死保卫祖国的每一寸土地，抵抗他们所痛恨的外国侵略者及其走狗李承晚。”
    朴正爱刚一结束演说，就立刻被沸腾了的会众包围了。中国及其他许多国家的女代表一涌上前和她拥抱、接吻。鲜花、礼物、纪念章不断投送到她面前。许多人被感动得流泪。会场上响彻了“金日成万岁”“朝鲜人民万岁”的欢呼声。
