　　Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 10th. The Southwest Military and Administrative Committee and the Headquarters of the Southwest Military Region of the People's Liberation Army, in order to correctly implement the Central People's Government's policies on the peaceful liberation of Tibet, jointly issued a proclamation to the Tibetan people and the troops entering Tibet as follows:
    Chairman Mao Zedong of our Central People's Government and Commander-in-Chief Zhu De of the People's Liberation Army deeply care for the Tibetan people who have long suffered oppression from British and American imperialism and the reactionary government of Chiang Kai-shek. They have specifically ordered our army to enter Tibet to help the Tibetan people forever free themselves from this oppression. All monks and people of Tibet should unite and give full assistance to the People's Liberation Army in order to expel imperialist forces, realize regional autonomy for the Tibetan nationality, and establish fraternal relations of friendship and mutual assistance with other nationalities in the country to jointly build a new Tibet within the new China. After the People's Liberation Army enters Tibet, it will protect the lives and property of all monks and people in Tibet, guarantee the freedom of religious belief of all people in Tibet, and protect all Lama temples. It will help the Tibetan people develop education, agriculture, animal husbandry, industry, and commerce, and improve the people's livelihood. The existing political and military systems in Tibet will not be changed. The existing Tibetan army will become part of the national defense force of the People's Republic of China. Monks, officials, and tribal leaders at all levels will continue to hold their posts as usual. All matters concerning various reforms in Tibet will be resolved entirely through consultations between the Tibetan people and Tibetan leaders, based on the will of the Tibetan people. Officials who were formerly pro-imperialist and pro-Kuomintang, if proven to have broken away from imperialism and the Kuomintang and do not engage in sabotage or resistance, may still continue to hold their posts without being held accountable for their past actions. The People's Liberation Army is disciplined and faithfully implements the above-mentioned policies of the Central People's Government. It respects the religious beliefs and customs of the Tibetan people. It speaks politely, conducts business fairly, does not take even a needle or thread from the people without compensation, and borrows furniture only with the consent of the owner, and if there is any damage, it will be compensated at the market price. It pays a reasonable price for employing people, livestock, and corvée labor. It does not impress laborers or seize livestock. The People's Liberation Army is an army of all nationalities in China, serving the people wholeheartedly. We hope that all farmers, herdsmen, workers, and merchants in Tibet will live and work in peace and contentment and not easily believe rumors and disturb each other. This proclamation is hereby made.
