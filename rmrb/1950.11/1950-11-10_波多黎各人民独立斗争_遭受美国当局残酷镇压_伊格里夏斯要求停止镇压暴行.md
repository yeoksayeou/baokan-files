　　Puerto Rican People's Independence Struggle
    Suffers Cruel Suppression by US Authorities
    Iglesias Demands an End to Suppression of Atrocities
    [Xinhua News Agency, 7th Dispatch] The US colonial authorities in Puerto Rico are carrying out brutal suppression of the local people's struggle for independence, against the implementation of the fascist McCarran Act, and against the conscription of Puerto Ricans to fight in Korea. According to a telecommunications report: Under the intensified implementation of fascist persecution by US imperialism and its Puerto Rican pawns, on October 30th, in the capital San Juan, Ponce, and other places, Nationalists of the Nationalist Party clashed with the colonial government police. The US colonial government in the area deployed tanks and other heavy weapons for bloody suppression. In the conflict, 27 people died and many were injured.
    The US colonial authorities in Puerto Rico took the opportunity to escalate the situation and carry out widespread terror against all patriots and democrats, making large-scale arrests. As of the 4th, 450 people had been arrested, including Iglesias, chairman of the Puerto Rican Communist Party, and Dr. Campos, chairman of the Nationalist Party. Arrests are continuing. Puerto Rico, located in the Caribbean Sea, has a population of 2.3 million and was acquired by the United States as a colony in the 1898 war against Spain.
    [Xinhua News Agency, 7th Dispatch] According to TASS, New York, 5th Dispatch: The US Workers' Daily published a statement by Iglesias, chairman of the Puerto Rican Communist Party, and Lichira, secretary of the Communist Party, regarding the recent anti-American uprising in Puerto Rico, stating: The armed struggle currently taking place in Puerto Rico reflects the Puerto Rican people's latent hatred of US imperialism and their rejection of the colonial regime.
    For a long time, the colonial government has been planning to provoke an armed struggle by the Nationalists, thereby undermining the Puerto Rican national liberation movement. The uprising on October 30 was an act of self-defense against the government's constant persecution. The fascist McCarran Act implemented in Puerto Rico, and the colonial government's laws restricting freedom of speech, are tools used by imperialism to destroy the national liberation movement. US imperialism's determination to maintain the colonial system in Puerto Rico is the sole reason for the bloody struggle on the island.
    The statement appealed to the people of the world, demanding that the Truman government stop the suppression in Puerto Rico and protect the lives of Campos (referring to the chairman of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party) and his party members. The statement demanded that the United Nations immediately recognize the right of the Puerto Rican people to national independence, immediately withdraw the Puerto Rican troops who are dying in Korea, stop forced military service, abolish the McCarran Act and the Taft-Hartley slavery bill, and enact laws to abolish lynching, discrimination, and segregation against blacks. The statement also called on the American people to support the Puerto Rican people's cause of independence.

　　波多黎各人民独立斗争
    遭受美国当局残酷镇压
    伊格里夏斯要求停止镇压暴行
    【新华社七日讯】波多黎各美国殖民当局，对该地人民争取独立、反对实施法西斯麦卡伦法案及反对征召波多黎各人赴朝鲜作战的斗争，实行残暴的镇压。据电通社报道：在美帝国主义及其波多黎各爪牙加紧实施法西斯迫害之下，十月三十日在首府圣约翰、蓬斯以及其他等地，民族主义的国民党人与殖民政府警察发生武装冲突。美国在该地的殖民政府出动了坦克和其他重武器进行了血腥的镇压。在冲突中，死二十七人，伤者甚众。
    波多黎各美国殖民当局乘机扩大事态，对所有爱国者与民主分子进行广泛的恐怖行动，大批逮捕。迄四日止已逮捕四百五十人，包括波多黎各共产党主席伊格里夏斯，国民党主席卡姆波斯博士。逮捕仍在继续中。按波多黎各位于加勒比海，有人口二百三十万，为美国于一八九八年对西班牙战争中取得的殖民地。
    【新华社七日讯】据塔斯社纽约五日讯：美国工人日报发表了波多黎各共产党主席伊格里夏斯和共产党书记利希拉署名的关于波多黎各新近的反美起义的声明称：目前在波多黎各进行着的武装斗争，反映了波多黎各人民对美帝国主义潜在的仇恨和对殖民地政权的唾弃。
    很久以来，殖民地政府一直打算挑起国民党人的武装斗争，从而破坏波多黎各的民族解放运动。十月三十日的起义，是反对政府的不断迫害的自卫行动。法西斯式的麦卡伦法案实施于波多黎各，以及殖民地政府制订的箝制自由言论的法律，都是帝国主义用以摧毁民族解放运动的工具。美帝国主义决心要保持在波多黎各的殖民制度，是造成波多黎各岛上的流血斗争的唯一原因。
    声明向全世界人民呼吁：要求杜鲁门政府停止在波多黎各的镇压行为，保障卡姆波斯（按系波多黎各国民党主席）与其党人们的生命。声明要求联合国立即承认波多黎各人民获得民族独立的权利，立即撤回正在朝鲜送命的波多黎各军队，停止强迫军役，废除麦卡伦法案和塔夫脱——哈特莱奴隶法案，并制订法律，废止对黑人的私刑、歧视与隔离制度。声明并要求美国人民支持波多黎各人民争取独立的事业。
