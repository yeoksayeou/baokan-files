　　How did American Imperialism Invade Shanghai After the Opium War?
　　Deng Pu
　　The forces of American imperialism invaded Shanghai, following on the heels of British imperialism. In 1842, British imperialism used cannons and warships to break into Wusongkou, massacred the Chinese people, and coerced the then-Chinese feudal ruling class into signing the Treaty of the Five Ports, seizing various preferential rights and consular jurisdiction. Subsequently, the British consul and the Chinese Daotai negotiated and opened the British concession in Shanghai, which became the main base for imperialists to invade Shanghai and China for nearly a century. Because the British invasion came with military and political power from the beginning, its true face was immediately recognized by the Chinese people.

　　Seeing that British imperialism had seized interests in Shanghai, the most important commercial port in China, American imperialism became envious. However, it used magic tricks, as if without any effort, to seize the same interests from China, and pretended to be a friend of China. This wolf in sheep's clothing sneaked in and carried out in-depth aggression. First, it sent Caleb Cushing as Minister Plenipotentiary to China, who arrived in Macau in February 1844 and met with Qiying, the Governor-General of Liangguang. He used both soft and hard tactics to force Qiying to conclude the so-called Treaty of Wangxia with him in a small village called Wangxia in Macau. The treaty stipulated that Americans could trade and reside in five ports and enjoy the privilege of consular jurisdiction, which was no different from what British imperialism had obtained.
　　　　An American Missionary Actually Opened the American Concession
　　Next, American imperialism also wanted to seize a large piece of land in Shanghai to establish a concession. It did not use force to invade Shanghai; nor did it have the consul, representing political power, come forward to open the concession. Later, it boasted that this was "friendship" towards China. But in reality, what difference was there between its aggression against the Chinese people and the people of Shanghai and that of British imperialism!
　　Who came forward to open the American concession in Shanghai? It was truly a strange thing, an American missionary! This should be a joke, but a large piece of land in Shanghai was lost to this missionary and became a base for imperialists to enslave and slaughter the Chinese people. In his political economy, Leontief said: "A bourgeois politician described the method of plundering colonies in two simple sentences: first the missionaries, then the merchants, and finally the warships and cannons. In fact, hypocritical missionaries are usually the top detectives of the notorious capitalist fraud culture." This is a perfect portrayal of the premeditated invasion of Shanghai by American imperialism.

　　There is a Tanggu Road in Hongkou, which was called Boone Road in the concession era. This was American imperialism's way of commemorating this pioneer of aggression. His name was William J. Boone, an American Episcopal bishop. After arriving in Shanghai, he purchased land in the Hongkou area north of the Suzhou Creek to build a church. At that time, the British concession started from the Yangjingbang (now filled in and called East Yan'an Road) in the south and ended at the Suzhou Creek in the north; the land north of the creek was still outside the boundary. Under the instructions of imperialist policy, this bishop launched a conspiracy to demarcate the Hongkou area, where his church was located, as an American concession. In 1848, he made such a request to the Shanghai Daotai; the Daotai was also very muddle-headed and weak, and after days of negotiations, he "generally" agreed to the Hongkou area north of the Suzhou Creek as the American concession. Thus, William Boone easily completed the task of seizing a colonial base in Shanghai for American imperialism under the cloak of the bishop.

　　In 1863, the British and American concessions merged to form the International Settlement. Although the British Empire ostensibly held the dominant power in the settlement, and it was generally referred to as the British concession, the British concession after that time contained elements of the American concession. American, British, and other imperialists jointly managed this concession, and American imperialism participated behind the scenes in all acts of aggression. For example, the May 30th Massacre, obstructing revolutionary forces in 1927, plotting with Chiang Kai-shek bandits to sabotage the revolution on April 12th, and instigating Japanese imperialism to launch armed aggression on January 28th and August 13th. American imperialism was invariably involved in or directly participated in these anti-people conspiracies that occurred in the concession or were plotted from the concession. Only because the establishment of the American concession in Shanghai was quite subtle, and its superficial disappearance occurred relatively early, it is easy to overlook this goal. However, it would be unfair to attribute all the crimes only to British, Japanese, and other imperialists while letting go of that cunning American imperialist criminal. The people of Shanghai, who have suffered deeply from the poison of American imperialism, have sharp eyes and will no longer be fooled by that jackal's trick.
　　　　Black Shops Inside the American Concession!
　　During the 1850s and 1860s, when the American concession in Shanghai still existed independently, although there were churches standing there, and the bishop claimed to be redeeming the "souls" of the "natives," in fact, this place was a black hell, openly carrying out slave trade ("piglet" trade) transactions, and it made the whole of Shanghai suffer a bad reputation, which still leaves people with lasting resentment!
　　New York has a Broadway, a place of extravagance and decadence. The old American concession in Shanghai also had a Broadway Road (now renamed Daming Road), facing the Huangpu River, which was the concentration area for black shops that kidnapped and sold people. On this road, many foreign wine shops were opened at that time. The bosses were all unpardonable foreign adventurers, mostly having committed serious crimes in their home countries and escaped abroad. When they came to the Shanghai concession, but were not welcomed by the British and French imperialist rulers south of the Suzhou Creek, they took refuge in the American concession "founded" by the archbishop. These foreign bullies often intoxicated customers in taverns with strong alcohol or sleeping pills, and then kidnapped them to ocean-going ships docked at the Huangpu River pier, making a good business – selling them overseas to be "piglets," or forcing them to work as sailors on ships. In this way, I do not know how many families were torn apart, and how many young and strong lives were tortured to death! The American concession that day was such a black hell, allowing foreign bullies to carry out such inhuman acts of plundering and slave trading, colluding with each other and dividing the spoils on the spot.

　　Because of these inhumane atrocities prevailing in the American concession in Shanghai, Shanghai has also been tainted with a bad reputation. In foreign language geographical names, some have changed to other meanings due to the characteristics or special products of the place, such as China (China) has the meaning of porcelain and pottery. As for the word Shanghai, it is very unfortunate, with a special meaning of "anesthetizing and kidnapping", which is due to the benefits of the flourishing black shops in the American concession. Try flipping through Webster's Collegiate Dictionary for the meaning of the word Shanghai:
　　To drug, intoxicate, or render insensible, and ship, as a sailor. (Administer anesthetics or spirits to make them lose consciousness, and take them to the ship to be sailors).
　　Also, the new dictionary published by Grosset & Dunlap in New York, also notes the following meanings:
　　(1) To impress seamen into service by force or treachery. (To force sailors into service by force or deception).
　　(2) To kidnap by force. (To kidnap by force).
　　The word "Shanghai" has these unfortunate meanings. If we do not look back at the ugly history of the old American concession, we will not know where it came from. This incident is enough to make us hate the American imperialist aggressors! (Reprinted from Shanghai's "Ta Kung Pao")

### 鸦片战争后美帝是怎样侵入上海的？

专栏：控诉美帝暴行，讨还血债——上海人民永不能忘的血海深仇

　　鸦片战争后美帝是怎样侵入上海的？
    邓普
    美帝的势力侵略进上海，是尾随了英帝而来的。英帝在一八四二年以大炮兵舰打进了吴淞口，屠杀了中国人民，胁迫当时的中国封建统治阶级签订了五口通商条约，攫得种种优越的权利和领事裁判权，继即由领事官和中国道台商妥，开辟上海英租界，成了以后将近一百年间帝国主义者侵略上海和侵略中国的大本营。由于英帝的侵入，开头就是挟了武力和政治力量而来的，所以它的真面目，当时就被中国人民识破。
    美帝看见英帝在中国最重要的商港上海攫得了利益，眼睛红了，但是他却以魔术的手法，好像不费吹灰之力似的，也从中国攫了同样的利益去，而且装做是中国的朋友，这只羊皮狼就混了进来，作纵深的侵略。它首先派遣顾兴（Caleb Cushing）做全权公使来华，于一八四四年二月到澳门，见了两广总督耆英，软硬兼施，逼得耆英和他在澳门的一个叫做望厦的小村落里，缔结了所谓望厦中美条约。条约中规定美国人在五个港口通商居住，以及领事裁判的特权，正和英帝所得的不相上下。
            一个美帝传教士竟然开辟美租界
    接着，美帝也要在上海强占一大块地方做租界了。它侵入上海，既没有使用武力；开辟租界，也不由领事官代表政治势力来出面。以后，它就自诩为这是对华的“友谊”。但究其实际，它对中国人民、上海人民的侵略，和英帝有什么分别呢！
    上海的美租界是由谁出面开辟的呢？真是咄咄怪事，是一个美帝的传教士！这说起来应该是桩笑话，然而上海的大片土地就曾断送在这个传教士手里，一度作了帝国主义者奴役与残杀中国人民的根据地。列昂节夫的政治经济学中说：“有位资产阶级的政治家，把掠夺殖民地的方法，用简单的两句话，描写如下：起初是传教士，然后为商人，最后便是军舰大炮。实际上，假仁假义的传教士，通常总是有名的资本主义欺诈文化的头等侦探。”对于美帝处心积虑地侵入上海的行动，这真是个最好的写照。
    虹口有条塘沽路，在租界时代的名称叫做文监师路（Boone Road），便是美帝纪念这个侵略先锋的。他的名字是文惠廉（William j. Boone），是个美国圣公会的主教。他来沪以后，便在苏州河北岸的虹口区域购地建造教堂。那时候的英租界，南起洋泾浜（已填没，现为延安东路），北迄苏州河；河北之地，尚在界外。这个主教在帝国主义政策指使之下，竟然发动一种阴谋，企图把他的教堂所在之地的虹口一带划作美租界，便于一八四八年向上海道台提出这样的要求；道台也是非常糊涂而荏弱，经过旬日的交涉以后，竟然“泛指”苏州河北岸虹口一带，答允了算是美租界。因而文惠廉轻轻地一动，就在主教的罩袍之下，替美帝完成了在上海侵占殖民基地的工作。
    到了一八六三年，英租界与美租界合并成为公共租界。由于租界权力的掌握，表面上是英帝占着优势，一般仍称之为英租界，其实此后的英租界中有着美租界的成份，美英和其他帝国主义者共管着这片租界，而一切侵略行为都有美帝在幕后参加。例如“五卅”血案，一九二七年阻挠革命势力，“四一二”策动蒋匪破坏革命，以及“一二八”、“八一三”怂恿日帝武装侵略，这些发生在租界以及以租界为策动基地的反人民阴谋，美帝是无一不预闻或直接参加的。只因上海美租界的创设经过颇为微妙，表面上的消失又为时较早，容易使人忽略这个目标。然而将一切罪行仅归诸英、日等帝国主义者，放纵了那一狡猾的美帝罪犯，毋乃是不公允的。饱受美帝荼毒的上海人民，眼睛是雪亮的，久已不再上那头豺狼的掩眼法的当了。
            美租界里面的黑店！
    当十九世纪五十——六十年代，上海美租界尚单独存在时，虽然有教堂在那儿矗立着，主教宣称正在为“土人”们赎救“灵魂”，事实上这地方是片黑地狱，公然做着奴隶买卖（“猪仔”买卖）的交易；且使整个的上海蒙受恶名，迄今令人有余恨！
    纽约有条百老汇街，是个纸醉金迷之所。上海的旧美租界中，也有条百老汇路（今改名为大名路），面临浦江，就是掳人出卖的黑店集中地带。这条路上，那时开了很多的洋酒店，老板都是些十恶不赦的外国冒险家，大抵是在国内犯了重罪，捕逃出境，来至上海租界，而在苏州河以南又不为英法帝国主义统治者所欢迎时，就托庇在大主教“创办”的美租界中。这些外国恶霸，经常在酒肆中以烈酒或蒙汗药醉倒顾客后，将他们绑架至停在浦江码头边的远洋轮船上，做一注注的好买卖——卖到外洋去做“猪仔”，或强迫在轮船上充当水手。这样，不知拆散了多少人家的骨肉，折磨掉多少条年轻力壮的人命！当日的美租界就是这样的一个黑地狱，放纵着洋恶霸做这种伤天害理的掳掠人身，奴隶贸易的行为，朋比为奸，坐地分赃。
    因为在上海美租界中流行着这种违反人道的暴行，连累上海也蒙上了恶名。外文中的地理名词，有因其地的特点或特产而转为他义者，如China （中国）有瓷器、陶器之义。至Shanghai（上海）一字，则非常倒楣，别有“麻醉绑架”之义，就是受得美租界黑店盛开的好处。试翻韦氏大学辞典Shanghai的字义云：
    To drug,intoxicate,or render insensible,and shiip,as a sailor.（饮以麻醉剂或烈酒，使之失去知觉，架至船上为水手）。
    又在纽约格洛塞特邓拉普书店出版的新字典中，也注有下列的字义：
    （１）To impress seamen iuto service by force or treachery.（以武力或欺骗强迫海员服务）。
    （２）To kidnap by force.（以武力绑架）。
    “上海”一字，会有这些倒楣的字义，倘若我们不回顾一下旧美租界的丑恶历史，定然不知是从什么地方引伸出来的。这一件事，已足以使我们痛恨美帝国主义侵略者了！（转载上海《大公报》）
