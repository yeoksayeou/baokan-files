　　Committee to Defend Peace and Oppose Aggression
    Prepares for Resist America, Aid Korea Exhibition
    [From Our Newspaper] The Chinese People's Committee to Defend World Peace and Oppose American Aggression, in order to conduct ideological education on resisting America and aiding Korea for the broad masses of people, has decided to hold an exhibition on "Resisting America, Aiding Korea, and Defending the Homeland." The exhibition is expected to open in mid-December. The preparatory committee for the exhibition was established on November 10th, with Luo Longji, Zheng Zhenduo, and 34 others forming the committee, and Luo Longji was elected as the chairman, and Zheng Zhenduo as the vice-chairman.
    The content of the exhibition has been determined, with the exhibition focusing on three major parts: The first part explains why American imperialist aggression cannot be ignored; the second part helps everyone correctly understand that American imperialism is a decadent and collapsing imperialist country, the enemy of peace-loving people all over the world, and is bound to be defeated; the third part focuses on introducing the strength of the world's peaceful and democratic forces.
    The preparatory committee began working at the Qianqiu Pavilion in the Palace Museum on the 13th of this month.
