　　Unforgettable Heroic Deeds
　　Remembering the Korean Comrades of the Railway Corps in the War of Liberation
　　By our reporter, Yong Jin
　　In the Railway Corps of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, there was a large group of Korean comrades who participated in the Chinese People's War of Liberation. Now, they have returned to the front lines of their motherland. However, they have left an indelible memory in the hearts of Chinese soldiers. Many Chinese comrades carefully preserve photos and messages from their Korean comrades-in-arms. Li Xiangde, Zheng Donghuan, and Jin Yingqiu wrote the following message to their comrade Wu Dazhong: "Although we have different nationalities, our ultimate goal is the liberation of mankind. We will stand together forever and fight to the end to defend world peace and democracy and realize a happy and brilliant communist society. We are determined to eliminate American imperialism and the puppet Li Chengwan from our homeland."
　　From the vast number of cadres and soldiers in the Railway Corps, I gained a deep overall impression: Korean comrades possess good qualities of hard work, endurance, courage, resourcefulness, and obedience to orders. They also possess a high degree of internationalist spirit. For the cause of the Chinese people's liberation, the blood of the Korean people was shed all over the fields of China, from the Yalu River to the Pearl River. Every Chinese person will forever remember the chivalrous actions of the Korean people in the Chinese revolution.
　　The broad masses of Korean cadres and soldiers all believe that the Chinese revolution is the same as the Korean revolution, and that the victory of the Chinese people is also the victory of the Korean people. This is what Park Guiyue, who joined the Chinese War of Liberation at the age of fourteen, said. She is now nineteen years old and is from Seoul. More than ten years ago, Japanese imperialism took her mother's life, and her father took this young girl to the Northeast. Driven by life, her father gave her away to someone else. At the age of fourteen, she joined the Democratic Allied Army on the right bank of the Yalu River, and now she is a nurse. From Park Guiyue, we can see the experiences of ordinary Korean comrades and find the reasons why they participated in the Chinese revolution. A deputy company commander named Park Jong-soo, who is from Cheong County, South Hamgyong Province, joined the Democratic Allied Army after "August 15th" and is now twenty-nine years old. Twenty years ago, his father was a member of the Anti-Japanese Allied Army. When he was seven years old, he and his mother transported and bought bullets for the Anti-Japanese Allied Army. After the liberation of the Northeast, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, land reform was implemented, and all Korean people living in the Northeast were allocated land. Park Jong-soo's family was also allocated two houses, two hectares of land, and two cows. They shared the same happy and beautiful life with the Chinese people. Park Jong-soo has made contributions to the cause of the Chinese people's liberation and is also an excellent Communist Party member. Like Park Guiyue and Park Jong-soo, many Korean people secretly crossed the Yalu River during the Japanese rule and joined the oppressed people of the Northeast between the Changbai Mountains and the Black Water, holding high the banner of liberation. In the Railway Corps alone, there were more than three thousand Korean men and women comrades. Under the cultivation of the Communist Party, they have all become strong fighters with an internationalist spirit.
　　Among these small number of Korean soldiers in the Railway Corps who participated in the Chinese People's War of Liberation, there are endless stories of Korean heroes. When Japanese imperialism surrendered in 1945 under the powerful impact of the Soviet Red Army, Kuomintang bandits secretly colluded with more than 10,000 surrendered Japanese soldiers and bandits to organize the Tonghua Riot, attempting to eliminate the local democratic government and sabotage the railway lines. This riot was put down with the assistance of the Korean "Red Light Detachment." Most of the Korean comrades in the Railway Corps participated in such anti-banditry wars in the Northeast, and some of them sacrificed their lives in the war.
　　In the Chinese People's War of Liberation, the Korean comrades in the Railway Corps also went through hardships. The vast majority of railway line repairs involved the blood and sweat of Korean comrades. Many Korean comrades participated in the Songhua River Grand Railway Bridge, which was successfully completed in October 1948. Chinese and Korean soldiers completed this great and arduous project under the guidance of Soviet experts.
　　The Korean comrades of the Railway Corps, together with their comrades, the Chinese soldiers who were also their brothers, pushed the Chinese revolution from victory to victory. In November 1949, the weather in the Northeast was extremely cold. The earth and rivers were frozen. At this time, we were rushing to repair the Qing (original) Fu (shun) section of the Shenji Road. In order to lay a good foundation for the sleeper piles, it was necessary to dig out the quicksand at the bottom of the river. A Korean comrade named Li Yongxin bravely took the lead in breaking the river ice and jumping into the water. Moved, many comrades also jumped in and dug out the sand, giving the sleeper piles a solid foundation. Li Yongxin is a Communist Party member. He often educated Korean comrades, saying: "Without the Communist Party, where would our home be? Wouldn't it have become an enemy-controlled area?"
　　In the ranks of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Korean comrades cherished Chinese comrades as much as Chinese comrades cherished them. Han Mingshu, the female nurse squad leader of the railway corps, is a good example. Han Mingshu is from Seoul and joined the Chinese People's Liberation Army in 1946. She is an excellent Communist Party member. In the difficult days of the war, she used her meager allowance to buy things for the sick. Like Chinese soldiers, she always filled the water tank of the landlord's house where she lived. She was honorably called a "model nurse" by the soldiers. During a mission on the Xianggui Railway, when the clothes of Korean comrades of the Second Company, meritorious servants of the Chinese people, and Nan Qingzhen, the platoon leader of the First Platoon of the Ninth Company, were soaked by the rain, he ran more than a thousand meters to carry old sleepers, came back, and made a fire to bake them for the comrades. On the way south, it rained heavily, and there was no shed on the train. Fearing that the soldiers would get sick from the rain, he took out his blanket to shield the comrades from the rain.
　　On the main railway lines in China, such as Jinghan, Jinpu, Beining, Longhai, Yuehan, and various Northeast lines, there are footprints of Korean comrades. They have made great achievements in the cause of the Chinese people's liberation and construction. Among this small number of Korean comrades in the Railway Corps alone, 906 Korean comrades have made contributions to the Chinese people's cause of liberation and construction, and 75 people have received commendations. Moreover, many Korean comrades shed their last drop of blood for the liberation and construction of the Chinese people. Communist Party member Li Zaishi, from Yeongju County, North Gyeongsang Province, was injured and sacrificed in December 1949 when the People's Army advanced to the Xianggui Railway, while building the Zixi Bridge in Dong'an County, Guangdong Province. Deputy squad leader Jin Desan, from Huanghae Province, worked selflessly on the Zhanghe Bridge project on the Yuehan Line on January 28, 1950, and unfortunately was injured and sacrificed. An Jishi, a Communist Party member who was called a "young hero" by the company, was credited twice. During the construction of the Luohe Grand Railway Bridge, he worked while sick and finally exhausted his last strength, dedicating his life to this grand bridge. In the vast fields of China, on the long and winding railway lines, Korean comrades have created brilliant achievements for the Chinese people. Let the Chinese people create even more brilliant achievements with the Korean people in the fight against the aggression of American imperialism!

　　不能忘怀的英雄行为
    记解放战争中铁道部队的朝鲜同志
    本报记者勇进
    在中国人民解放军的铁道部队里，有着大批参加中国人民解放战争的朝鲜同志。现在，他们已经回到自己祖国的前线去了。但是他们在中国战士的心里，却留下了永久不可磨灭的记忆。在很多中国同志的身边，小心地保存着朝鲜战友的照片和赠言。李相德、郑东焕、金应球曾给他的战友吴大中写下这样的赠言：“虽然我们有民族的不同，但是我们的最终目标都是为了人类的解放。我们永久地站在一起，为保卫世界和平民主与实现幸福灿烂的共产主义社会而奋斗到底。我们有决心消灭我们国土上的美帝国主义及傀儡李承晚。”
    在铁道部队的广大干部与战士中，我得到了一个深刻的综合印象，就是：朝鲜同志有吃苦耐劳、英勇机智、服从命令的良好品质，他们也具有高度的国际主义精神。为了中国人民的解放事业，朝鲜人民的鲜血洒遍了中国的原野，从鸭绿江到珠江。每一个中国人都永远记忆着朝鲜人民在中国革命中的侠义行为。
    广大的朝鲜干部、战士，他们都认为在中国革命与在朝鲜革命一样，中国人民的胜利也是朝鲜人民的胜利。一个从十四岁就参加了中国解放战争的朴桂月就是这样说的。她今年十九岁了，是汉城人。十多年前，日本帝国主义把她母亲的生命夺去了，她父亲领着这个幼小的女孩子到了东北，父亲被生活逼迫着将她给了人家。到十四岁时，她在鸭绿江的右岸参加了民主联军，现在她是个护士。从朴桂月的身上，我们可以看到一般朝鲜同志的遭遇，并能够找寻到他们参加中国革命的原因。一个叫做朴宗洙的副连长，他是咸南北青郡人，“八一五”后就参加了民主联军，现在二十九岁了。二十年前，他父亲是个抗日联军的队员，他在七岁时与母亲到了东北。日本人统治东北的时候，他母亲与他给抗日联军运买子弹。东北解放了，在中国共产党的领导下，实行了土地改革，所有留居在东北的朝鲜人民都分得了土地，朴宗洙家也分了两间房子，两垧地和两头牛，他们与中国人民分享着同样幸福的美好生活。朴宗洙在中国人民的解放事业上立过功，他也是个优秀的共产党员。很多的朝鲜人民像朴桂月和朴宗洙一样的，在日本统治时偷偷地渡过鸭绿江在白山黑水间与被压迫的东北人民在一起，高举起解放的大旗。仅仅在铁道部队里就有三千余朝鲜的男女同志。他们在共产党的培育下，都成为具有国际主义精神的坚强战士。
    仅仅在这些参加中国人民解放战争的一小部分铁道部队的朝鲜战士中，就有写不尽的朝鲜英雄的业迹。当一九四五年日本帝国主义在强大的苏联红军冲击之下投降的时候，国民党匪徒暗暗地勾结投降的日本人和胡匪一万多人组织了通化暴动，企图消灭当地的民主政权，并破坏铁路线。这一暴动是在朝鲜人“红光支队”的援助下扑灭的。铁道部队的朝鲜同志大多都参加了像这样的东北的剿匪战争，并且有的是在战争中牺牲了。
    铁道部队的朝鲜同志在中国人民解放战争中，同样的历尽了艰难困苦，绝大多数铁路线的修复，都有朝鲜同志的血汗。一九四八年十月胜利竣工的淞花江大铁桥，就有很多朝鲜同志参加了，中、朝战士们在苏联专家的指导下完成了这个伟大而艰巨的工程。
    铁道兵团的朝鲜同志和自己的同志，也是自己兄弟的中国战士一起，将中国的革命从胜利推向胜利。一九四九年十一月东北的天气，是十分寒冷的。大地、河流为冰封冻了。这时我们抢修沈吉路清（原）抚（顺）段，为使枕木垛基础打的好，必需挖出河底的流沙。一个朝鲜同志李永信奋勇当先地将河冰打开，跳下水去，感动得很多同志也都跳下去，挖出沙子来，使得枕木垛有了稳固的基础。李永信是个共产党员，他经常教育朝鲜的同志说：“没有共产党，咱们的家在哪，还不变成了敌人的统治区。”
    在中国人民解放军的行列中，朝鲜同志像中国同志爱护他们一样的爱护着中国的同志。铁路部队的女护士班长韩明淑就是一个很好的例子。韩明淑是汉城人，一九四六年参加了中国人民解放军，她是个优秀的共产党员。在战争艰苦的日子里，她把自己领到的一点津贴给病号买东西吃。她像中国的战士一样，在所住的房东家里，总是将房东的水缸打得满满的。她被战士们光荣地称作“模范护士”。二连的朝鲜同志、中国人民的功臣，九连一排长南庆镇在湘桂路执行任务的时候，同志们的衣服都给雨淋湿了，他跑出一千多米远的地方去扛旧道木，回来生火给同志们烤。南下途中下大雨，火车上没棚子，他怕战士们淋病了，把自己的毯子拿出来给同志们遮雨。
    在中国主要的铁路线上，如京汉、津浦、北宁、陇海、粤汉、及东北各路线，都有朝鲜同志的足迹，他们在中国人民的解放与建设事业上是有丰功伟绩的。仅仅在这一小部分铁道部队的朝鲜同志中，就有九百零六个朝鲜同志在中国人民的解放事业与建设事业上立了功，有七十五人受到通令表扬。而且有许多朝鲜同志为了中国人民的解放与建设，流出了最后的一滴血，共产党员李在石，他是庆尚北道永州郡人，在一九四九年的十二月，当人民军队挺向湘桂路的时候，在广东省东安县修建紫溪桥时受伤牺牲了。副班长金得三，黄海道人，一九五○年的一月二十八日在粤汉线樟河桥工程上，以忘我精神工作着，不幸负伤而牺牲了。一个被连队上称为“少年英雄”的共产党员安吉世，他立过两次功，在洛河大铁桥的修建中，抱病工作，终于用尽最后的力气，将自己的生命贡献在这座大铁桥上了。在中国的广大原野上，在纵横绵长的铁道线上，朝鲜同志给中国人民创造了光辉的业迹，让中国人民在反对美帝国主义的侵略中，与朝鲜人民创造更辉煌的业迹吧！
