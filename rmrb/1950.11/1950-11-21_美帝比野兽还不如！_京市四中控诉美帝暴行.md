　　The American Imperialists are Even Worse Than Beasts!
     --Beijing No. 4 Middle School Condemns American Imperialist Atrocities
    On the afternoon of November 15th, at 5 PM, No. 4 Middle School held a "Resist America, Aid Korea, Protect Our Homes and Defend Our Country" rally.
    Mr. Liu Bozhong, over sixty years old, with graying hair, staggered onto the stage and recounted with grief and indignation how American imperialists oppressed Chinese workers in Guangzhou sixty years ago. He described how, during the Japanese occupation, he was imprisoned in the jail that is now the Peking University Red Building. He watched as Japanese devils took Chinese people away one by one, beat them brutally, force-fed them water, and had them devoured by wolves, all dying in horrific screams and moans. The bloody memories moved him so deeply that his voice trembled and he could no longer continue.
    Liu Yongkang from Senior Grade 3, Class B, said: "In 1944, in Chongqing, the capital of the Kuomintang, when everyone was still singing that Americans were our friends, I was in elementary school. One day, my most respected teacher, Ms. Huang, went out. On the highway from Caiyuanba to the city, an American jeep drove past her. The American soldiers forcibly dragged her into the car and drove her to the airport. We didn't see Ms. Huang come to class for several days. Later, we found out that she had been taken to the barracks by the American soldiers. The beasts wanted to rape her. She could not escape and could not endure it, so she hanged herself."
    Guan Qiulan, a student from Mu Zhen Girls' Middle School, was an overseas Chinese who had returned from Nanyang. She recounted the trampling that overseas Chinese had suffered under the clutches of American, British, and French imperialists. The students were all so angry and grieved that they wept. She also mentioned that someone who had just returned from Korea told her that in Korea, several American soldiers burst into a farmer's house and gang-raped the farmer's daughter in front of her father. After the gang rape, they even had the audacity to force the farmer at gunpoint to rape his own daughter. The vulgar American soldiers clapped and laughed. Before leaving, they even shot and killed the father and daughter. At this moment, the people in the venue were immersed in unparalleled grief and indignation. Suddenly, a student with tears in the corner of her eyes stood up and shouted in a hoarse and high-pitched voice: "Beat these beasts to death!" The whole venue immediately roared like thunder: "Beat these beasts to death!" "Beat these beasts to death!" After a moment of silence, a sharp voice came from the crowd: "They are even worse than beasts!" Many of the female students in the front wiped away their tears and silently lowered their heads.
    The students immediately associated the crimes of the Japanese devils with the American imperialists' support of Japanese war criminals. Liu Wenshan from Senior Grade 3, Class A, said: "During the Japanese occupation, I don't know how many people they massacred. In the winter of 1939, in our village, I personally saw the corpses of my aunt and cousin who had been killed by Japanese devils. My aunt's stomach was torn open, and my cousin's hand was inserted into my aunt's stomach. It was winter, and the corpses were stiff on the road, but no one dared to move them. In the same winter, I also personally saw Japanese devils drag my aunt from the kang house to the outer room to rape her. At the same time, another woman was also raped. After they were raped, they wanted to commit suicide, swallowing hair, swallowing match heads, and hanging themselves. They were pulled back and dissuaded several times, but they did not die. Soon, the Japanese devils raped them again!"
    After each bloody fact was told, everyone couldn't help but shout: "A blood debt must be repaid with blood!" "Down with the American aggressors!" and other slogans. During each brief pause in the slogans, some students couldn't help but stand up to pour out the bitterness in their hearts. One student said: "This blood debt is countless, and today we have only mentioned a drop in this sea of blood. American imperialism has invaded China for decades, and the blood debt is getting deeper and deeper day by day. We must demand repayment of these blood debts!"

　　美帝比野兽还不如！
     ——京市四中控诉美帝暴行
    十一月十五日下午五时四中礼堂召开了一个“抗美援朝保家卫国大会”。
    六十多岁，头发灰白的刘伯忠先生踉跄地走上讲台，悲愤地叙述了六十年前广州美帝欺压中国工人的情况。叙述了日寇统治时期，他被囚押在现在北大红楼的那所监狱里。眼看着日本鬼子把一个个的中国人带去，毒打、灌水、被狼狗嚼食，在惨号呻吟中死去。血的回忆，使他太激动了，以至最后声音颤抖得不能再说下去。
    高三乙刘永康说：“一九四四年，在国民党的首都重庆，当大家还正在高唱着美国人是我们朋友的时候，我正读小学，有一天，我最敬爱的黄先生（女）出外，在从菜园坝到城里的公路上，一辆美国吉普车从她旁边开过，美国兵把她硬拉上汽车开到飞机场去。一连几天没有见黄先生来上课。后来打听到，她被美兵带到兵营。野兽们要奸污她，她无法逃脱，也不能忍受，便上吊自杀了。”
    慕贞女中关秋岚同学是从南洋回国的华侨。她讲述了侨胞们在美、英、法帝国主义者魔掌下所受的蹂躏。同学们都愤怒悲痛得流着眼泪。接着她还讲到一位刚从朝鲜回来的人告诉她，在朝鲜，几个美军撞到一个农家的屋里，当着父亲轮奸了农夫的女儿。轮奸完了，还异想天开地拿着手枪逼着农夫强奸他自己的亲生女儿。下流的美国兵却鼓掌大笑。临走时，竟枪杀了父女俩。这时，会场的人们沉陷在无比的悲愤中。突然一个眼角闪着泪光的同学站了起来，用嘶哑而高亢的声音大呼：“打死这群野兽！”全场立刻像雷鸣一样地怒吼着：“打死这群野兽！”“打死这群野兽！”在稍转沉寂的时候，一个尖锐的声音从人丛中发出：“他们比野兽还不如！”前面许多女同学擦着眼泪，默默地低着头。
    同学们从美帝扶植日本战犯又立刻联想起日寇的罪行。高三甲刘文山同学说：“在日寇统治时，不知道它们残杀了多少人。一九三九年冬，在我们村子里，我亲眼看见过我舅母和表弟被日本鬼子杀死的尸体。我舅母的肚子被戳开，孩子的手插在舅母的肚子里。这是冬天，尸首放在大路上都僵了，但大家不敢去搬运。就在这一年冬天，我又亲眼看见日本鬼子从炕屋里把婶母拉到外屋去强奸，同时还有另一个妇女也被强奸。她们被强奸后要自杀，吞头发，吞火柴头，上吊，几次都被人拉劝着没有死成。不久，日本鬼子又把她们给强奸了！”
    在每一件血的事实讲过后，大家就忍不住要大喊：“血债血还！”“打倒美国侵略军！”等口号。在每次口号稍一间歇的时候，又有同学禁不住要站起来倾诉心中的苦水。一位同学说：“这血债是数不完的，今天我们只提到了这血海中的一滴。美帝侵略中国几十年，血债一天比一天深。我们一定要讨还这些血债！”
