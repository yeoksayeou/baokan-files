　　"We must never let the American imperialist wolf come to eat people again!"
　　——400,000 farmers in the suburbs of Beijing hate American imperialism
　　By our reporter Lu Sheng
　　The 400,000 emancipated farmers in the suburbs of Beijing, while busily harvesting rice and plowing the autumn fields, are closely watching the crimes of American imperialism in invading Korea and American planes constantly strafing our Northeast compatriots. After a day's work in the fields, they quickly eat dinner and gather in literacy classes, asking district cadres to explain current events.

　　Farmers in Xinkailu, Nanyuan Town, in the southern suburbs, expressed extreme indignation at the American air force's continuous strafing of our Northeast compatriots who are invading Korea. Youth League member Yang Zongxiang said to everyone: "American imperialism is just like the Japanese devils, they are all man-eating wolves. If we don't resist them, they will run into our homes and eat people. Think about it: after the Japanese surrendered, American imperialism helped Chiang Kai-shek with planes and artillery, killing so many of our compatriots! Now it has openly occupied Taiwan, sent troops to slaughter the Korean people, and continues to use planes to bomb our Northeast compatriots. This shows that American imperialism, this wild wolf, is approaching us step by step, and wants to eat people again. We have all suffered from the oppression of imperialism for many years, and we have only been liberated today with great difficulty. Can we wait for him to eat people again?" Female League member Shi Xiulan painfully recalled her past life. She said: When the Japanese devils ruled Beijing, Nanjiao didn't know how many people starved to death. At that time, her family had no house or land, and worked hard for others every day, unable to even eat "mixed noodles." After Japan surrendered, the Kuomintang reactionaries and American soldiers came to oppress people again. Not only was life even harder at this time, but even walking on the street was very dangerous. Once, she was so hungry on the street that she could barely walk, and was almost run over by an American car heading to Nanyuan Town. However, she said: "After liberation, my family was allocated six mu of paddy fields, and I opened 1.8 mu of dry land myself. The grain harvested cannot be eaten in a year. We have only lived this kind of life for a year, and the American devils are coming to invade us again!" Before she could finish speaking, Cui Deshan, a village farmers' association member, continued: "Speaking of the oppression of imperialism, my family has suffered enough! When the Japanese devils occupied Beijing, my four brothers labored, but there was still no food to eat every year. Was it because we were unwilling to work? Was it because we were incapable? Neither. Our farmers, regardless of spring, summer, autumn or winter, wind or rain, have never stopped working. It was because imperialism and the running dogs of traitors oppressed us so that we could not live. Eight years ago, when the Japanese devils occupied Beijing, my four brothers had no choice but to contract forty mu of alkaline land from the landlord Yang Shutian. At that time, it was stipulated in the contract that the lease would be for three years, and a deposit of thirty dan would be paid in advance. In the first year, because the alkalinity was high, very little grain was harvested. In order to continue farming, the family gritted their teeth and paid the deposit, only eating sweet potatoes and red sorghum. In the autumn, my four brothers plowed the land all over again and applied a lot of manure, planting wheat, thinking: as long as we put in the effort and apply manure, we will always harvest more grain. Who knew that in the second year, when the landlord saw that the wheat was growing well, his eyes turned red. Before the wheat was ripe, he forcibly took back the land, neither letting us harvest the wheat nor returning the deposit, making my whole family cry bitterly and making my father sick. The three younger brothers had strong tempers and went to the landlord's house to reason in a fit of anger, but under the rule of imperialism and the running dogs of traitors, there was no reasoning to be had. Not only did the three brothers fail to reason, but they were detained in the district by Li Qi, a running dog of the Japanese devils, for three months. The wheat was cut by the landlord, and the old father was angered to death by the landlord!" Speaking of this, he cried.

　　After a pause, Cui Deshan wiped away his tears and continued: "Thinking about it, my third brother, Cui Deru, did the right thing. After he came out of prison, he told my mother: 'If we don't overthrow imperialism and eliminate the running dogs of traitors, there will be no way for us poor people to live.' He sneaked out of the suburbs at night and went to the mountains in Rehe Province to join the Eighth Route Army. Under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, he resolutely resisted Japan for eight years and overthrew the Japanese devils. At that time, when we received a letter from my third brother, the whole family was happy, thinking that it was time for the poor to stand up. Who knew that the Japanese devils stationed in Beijing had not all left, and the Kuomintang reactionaries and American devils came again. More than 500 American devils lived at the Nanyuan Airport, and drove around Nanyuan Street in cars every day. People in the street would be run over by their cars if they were not careful. Li Qi, who used to be a running dog for the Japanese devils, became a running dog for the American devils at that time, and the landlord who oppressed my family was still so imposing. When my fourth brother, Cui Dehua, saw this situation, he said to me: 'Brother! I see through it. Whether it's Japanese devils or American devils, they are all the same in harming people. If we don't overthrow them, it will be difficult for us to stand up for the rest of our lives.' From then on, my four brothers joined the People's Liberation Army and fought against the Chiang Kai-shek bandit army, the running dogs of American imperialism. After fighting for three years, Beijing was liberated, the Chinese mainland was liberated, and our suburban farmers were able to stand up under the leadership of the Communist Party." He happily continued: "Decades of hatred were eliminated in just one year." Last year, he sued the landlord Yang Shutian for the oppression of his family to the People's Court. The court ruled that Yang Shutian should apologize to his family and compensate them with thirty-four dan of grain. During the land reform last winter and spring, his family was allocated twenty mu of land, and this summer he harvested more than three hundred catties of wheat, and this autumn he harvested two thousand and five hundred catties of rice, and his life began to improve. After the autumn harvest, he found the remains of his father, who had been angered to death by the landlord eight years ago and buried wrapped in a mat, and reburied them in a coffin. Now he is a member of the village farmers' association. His eldest brother is the village public security officer. He compared his current life with his previous life and said very solemnly: "Judging from the facts of my family, without overthrowing imperialism and the running dogs of traitors, there is no way for our farmers to stand up. Now American imperialism is massacring the people in Korea in large numbers, and has also occupied our Taiwan, and wants to attack China again. I see through it, the good life that Chairman Mao led us to fight for, American imperialism is going to destroy again. If we farmers don't unite to resist American aggression, we won't be able to protect our good life." He said firmly and confidently: "Whether it's American devils or Japanese devils, tell them! Now our farmers are not what they used to be. After liberation, we have all united under the leadership of the Communist Party. We must never let the American devils come to destroy our lives again."

　　Shicun is a place in the suburbs that produces vegetables. In the past, the Chiang bandit army went to the village every day to rob vegetables to feed the American soldiers living at Nanyuan Airport. None of the 320 households in the village had a complete house. The doors and windows were all taken to the airport to repair the blockhouses, and the houses were all riddled with holes, preparing for a battlefield. All the men in the village between the ages of fifteen and forty-five were organized into a conscript team and went to the airport every day to dig holes for the American soldiers. Village head Chen Zhenlin recalled his life back then: "At that time, there was not a single man to be seen in the whole village. The women and children left at home ate boiled cabbage roots and sweet potatoes every day. It was not until after liberation that the farmers had land and food. Now the farmers truly realize that imperialism is a man-eating beast. If we don't overthrow American imperialism, which is invading us, there will be no way for the farmers to live."

　　The more than 2,000 farmers in Balizhuang in the eastern suburbs listen to lectures in literacy classes every day. When they hear the news of the American imperialists massacring people in Korea, they hate them in their hearts. Li Wengui, director of the farmers' association, said: "American imperialism is like a locust. Wherever it flies, the crops there will suffer. Now that the American imperialists are killing and setting fires in Korea, it's like locusts flying into the fields of our neighbors. If we don't unite with the Korean people to fight the locusts, our crops will also be eaten." He pointed to the rice on his bed and said: "Look, we just got land this year and harvested so much grain that we don't even have furniture to store it. Good life has just begun, and the American devils are coming to destroy it again. In order to protect our good life, we farmers must unite and put out all our strength to fight the American devils!"

　　The old men Cui Bing, Wang Kuan, Liu Rongguang, and Liu Wenshou, whose sons were taken away by the Chiang bandit army three years ago, found Hu Lijun, chairman of the women's federation, when they heard the news that American imperialism was going to attack China again, and asked her to write letters to their sons in the People's Liberation Army. Wang Kuan said in his letter to his son Wang Yuefu: "Your father has no other hope for you, only that you always remember: who took you away and made our family unable to live? Who liberated you and made our family stand up? I also hope that you will work hard and not let the American devils and Chiang bandit army come to our suburbs to arrest people again."

　　“决不能让美帝野心狼再来吃人！”
    ——京郊四十万农民对美帝国主义的憎恨
    本报记者鲁生
    京郊四十万翻身农民，每天在紧张地打稻子、秋耕地的劳作中，密切注视着美帝侵略朝鲜和美机不断扫射我东北同胞的罪行。在田间劳动一天之后，他们很快吃过晚饭，纷纷集中到识字班里，请区干部讲解时事。
    南郊南苑镇新开路的农民们，对侵略朝鲜的美空军不断扫射我东北同胞，表示极端愤恨。青年团员杨宗祥对大家说：“美帝国主义和日本鬼子一样，都是吃人的野心狼，不抵抗他，他就要跑进家来吃人。我们想想：美帝国主义从日寇投降后，就帮助蒋介石飞机大炮，杀死我国多少同胞！现在又公开侵占了台湾，派兵屠杀朝鲜人民，还不断用飞机轰炸我东北同胞，这说明美帝这个野心狼，一步一步逼近我们，又想来吃人了。我们都受了多年帝国主义的压迫，好容易盼到今天才得到解放，我们还能等待他再来吃人吗？”女团员石秀兰痛心地回忆起过去的生活。她说：日本鬼子统治北京时，南郊不知饿死了多少人。那时，她家房无一间地无一垅，天天给人做苦工，连“混合面”都吃不到。日本投降了，国民党反动派、美国兵又来压迫人，这时不但生活更苦，连到街上走路都很危险。有一次，她在街上饿得走不动，几乎被开往南苑镇的美国汽车轧死了。可是，她说：“解放后，我家分到六亩水地，我自己又开了一亩八分旱地，打的粮食一年也吃不完。这样的生活才过一年，美国鬼子又要来侵略我们了！”她还没说完，村农会委员崔德山接着说：“提起帝国主义的压迫，我家是受够了！日本鬼子占北京时，我家弟兄四人劳动，还是年年没吃的，是咱不肯劳动吗？是咱没能力吗？都不是，咱农民不管春夏秋冬，风天雨天，都没有停止过劳动。就是因为帝国主义和汉奸走狗压迫得咱们不能过。八年前，日本鬼子侵占了北京，我弟兄四人没办法，包租地主杨树田四十亩碱地，当时立契言明，一包三年，先交押租三十石。第一年，因为碱性大，打粮食很少，为了继续包种地，一家人咬着牙把粮食交了押租，只吃些白薯和红高粱，秋天，我弟兄四人把土地全翻一遍，又上了很多粪，种上麦子，想着：只要下到力、上到粪，总会多收一点粮食。谁知到了第二年，地主看到麦子长得好，眼珠都红了，没等麦子长熟，就强行收地，既不让我们收麦，又不退还押租，气得我全家人痛哭，气得我父亲害起病来。三兄弟性子强，一股火找到地主家里去说理，但是，在帝国主义及汉奸走狗统治下，那有理可说呢？三兄弟没有说成理，反被日本鬼子一个走狗李岐扣到区里。一扣三个月。麦子叫地主割了，老父亲叫地主气死了！”说到这里，他哭了起来。
    停了一会，崔德山擦干眼泪继续说：“想起来，我三兄弟崔德如做得对。他从监里出来，告我母亲说：“不打倒帝国主义，不消灭汉奸走狗，就没有我们穷人的活路。”趁夜里他悄悄逃出郊区，到热河省山里参加了八路军。他在共产党毛主席领导下坚决抗日，抗了八年，把日本鬼子打倒了。那时接到我三兄弟信，全家人都高兴，想着这可该穷人翻身了。谁知驻北京的日本鬼子还没走完，国民党反动派和美国鬼子又来了，美国鬼子在南苑飞机场住了五百多，每天坐上汽车，在南苑街里乱撞，街里人一不小心，就会被他们的汽车轧死。过去给日本鬼子当走狗的李岐，那时又成了美国鬼子的走狗，压迫我家的地主还是那么威风。我四兄弟崔德华看到这种情况，就和我说：“哥！我看透了，不论日本鬼子美国鬼子，都是一样的害人，不打倒他们，我们一辈子也难翻身。”从此，我四兄弟就参加了人民解放军，和美帝国主义的走狗蒋介石匪军作战。打了三年，解放了北京，解放了中国大陆，我们郊区农民才在共产党领导下翻起身来。”他欢喜地接着说：“几十年来的仇恨，去年一年就消了。”去年他把地主杨树田欺压他家的事上诉到人民法庭，法庭判决杨树田向他家道歉，又包赔粮食三十四石。去冬今春土地改革时，他家分到二十亩地，今年夏天收了三百多斤麦子，今年秋天收了两千五百斤稻子，生活开始改善了。收秋后，他找到八年前被地主气死而用席子裹着埋了的父亲的遗体，重装到棺木里埋葬了。现在他担任着村农会委员。他大哥是村公安员。他把现在的生活和从前的生活作了比较，很郑重的说：“从我一家的事实来看，不打倒帝国主义和汉奸走狗，压根儿没有我们农民翻身的时候。现在美帝国主义在朝鲜大批屠杀人民，还侵占了我们的台湾，又想进攻中国。我看透了，毛主席领导我们斗争得来的好生活，美帝国主义又要来破坏了，我们农民若不团结起来，抵抗美帝的侵略，就保不住我们的好生活。”他坚决而有信心地说：“不论美国鬼子日本鬼子，告诉他们吧！现在我们农民可不比过去了，解放后，我们都在共产党领导下团结起来了，绝不能让美国鬼子再来破坏我们的生活。”
    时村是郊区产蔬菜的地方，过去，蒋匪军每天到村里抢菜，给住在南苑机场的美国兵吃。全村三百二十户，没有一家的房子是完整的，门窗全被拿到飞机场修了炮楼，房子都打成了洞，准备作战场。全村十五岁以上四十五岁以下的男人都被编成壮丁队，每天到飞机场给美国兵挖洞。村长陈振林回忆当年的生活说：“那时全村看不到一个男人，家中剩下的女人和小孩，天天煮白菜根和红薯吃。直到解放后，农民才有了土地，有了吃的。到现在农民真正认识了帝国主义是吃人的野兽，不打倒侵略我们的美帝国主义，就没有农民的活路。”
    东郊八里庄的两千多农民，每天在识字班里听讲，当听到美帝在朝鲜屠杀人民的消息时，心里就恨透了。农会主任李文贵说：“美帝国主义就像蝗虫，飞到那里，那里庄稼就受害。现在美帝在朝鲜杀人放火，就像我们邻家地里飞来了蝗虫，我们要不和朝鲜人共同团结起来打蝗虫，我们的庄稼也会被吃掉。”他指着他家床上放的稻子说：“你看，今年刚分到土地，打下这么多粮食，连放粮食的家具都没有。好生活刚开始，美国鬼子又要来破坏。我们农民为了保护好生活，必须团结起来，拿出一切力量和美国鬼子拚命！”
    三年前被蒋匪军抓走儿子的崔丙、王宽、刘荣广、刘文寿老汉，听到美帝国主义又要进攻中国的消息，就找到妇联会主席胡立俊，叫给他们在人民解放军里的儿子写信。王宽给儿子王月复的信中说：“父亲对你没有别的希望，只望你时时记住：是谁抓走你弄得咱家不能过？是谁解放了你，使咱家翻起身来？还望你努力奋斗，不能让美国鬼子和蒋匪军再来咱郊区抓人。”
