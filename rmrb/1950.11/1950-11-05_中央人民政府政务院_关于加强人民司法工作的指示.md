　　The first National Judicial Work Conference in July and August discussed some of the main issues related to people's judicial work in various regions. It has reached preliminary unified conclusions on the policy viewpoints, work guidelines, and work tasks of people's judiciary. Now, in order to strengthen the construction of people's judicial work, the following instructions are given:

　　1. In order to defend the victory of the people's democratic revolution, suppress counter-revolutionary activities, consolidate the new social order, and protect the legitimate rights and interests of the people, the people's judicial work, like the people's army and the people's police, is one of the important tools of the people's political power. Therefore, governments at all levels must earnestly lead and strengthen this work, and take necessary measures to systematically establish and improve the people's judicial system nationwide. Taking a nonchalant attitude towards this work is wrong.

　　2. In order to correctly engage in the construction of people's judicial work, it is first necessary to clearly define the principled boundaries between the old and new laws. Law is a tool used by a certain ruling class to rule the ruled class and protect its own class. All laws of the Kuomintang reactionary government were tools used by a reactionary group of a small number of people to oppress the broad masses of the Chinese people. People's law is a law that represents the will of the broad masses of the people, educates the people to respect the social order of the New Democracy, and struggles to protect the interests of the broad masses of the people against the sabotage of a small number of reactionaries. The two fundamentally different legal principles should never be confused in one concept. People who harbor this confused concept cannot correctly engage in the construction of people's judicial work. Therefore, it is inappropriate for all government workers to retain any vague views on the demarcation between old and new laws. At present, the new laws of our country cannot yet be perfected, but the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, which is a basic law, and the many laws, decrees, instructions, and decisions issued by the Central People's Government Committee, the Government Administration Council, the Supreme People's Court, and other agencies are all important bases for people's judicial work. It is gradually produced based on the Marxist-Leninist theory of the state and the specific analysis of China's actual conditions (class relations, social and economic relations, etc.). Workers in the construction of people's judiciary must, in practice, clarify the views and influences of those old and reactionary laws on the one hand, and continuously summarize experience and study precedents on the other hand, so that the Central People's Government can gradually formulate complete new laws.

　　3. The current main tasks of the people's judicial work are to suppress reaction and protect the people. For counter-revolutionaries, the first is suppression. Only suppression can make them plead guilty. Only after they plead guilty can we talk about leniency. Leniency can only be combined with suppression. The tendency of "unlimited leniency" in some areas must be corrected. When suppressing, it is necessary to distinguish between the severity of crimes and between principal offenders and accomplices, but all elements engaged in counter-revolutionary activities after liberation must be punished. The task of the people's judicial work is to punish criminals and protect the good. Criminals who sabotage national construction and property, disrupt social order, and infringe upon the legitimate rights and interests of the people must be punished. Only punishment can make them confess their crimes. Only after they confess their crimes can we talk about education and reform. Education can only be combined with punishment. One-sidedly emphasizing "education and reform" is wrong; it is also necessary to correct the neglect of education and reform work after punishing and confessing crimes. The people's judicial work must also handle disputes among the people. Sufficient attention should also be paid to such civil cases. On the one hand, mass mediation methods should be adopted as much as possible to reduce people's litigation. On the other hand, judicial organs should strive to implement the mass line in their work, promote litigation procedures and various trial systems that are convenient for the people, connect with the people, and rely on the people. Governments at all levels should regularly listen to work reports from judicial organs. Under the guidance and assistance of governments at all levels and in close cooperation with the work of relevant departments, people's judicial organs at all levels should organize forces to accelerate the deadline for case trials, and resolutely eliminate the formalism and procrastination left over from the Kuomintang courts. Actively improve the quality of case trials, and at the same time, widely carry out publicity and education on the rule of law, and strictly correct the occurrence of illegal and discipline-violating phenomena. No matter whether it is a government agency, a public official, or a person, if there is any illegal act, it should be reported by the inspection agency.

　　4. To strengthen the people's judicial work, it is necessary to equip a certain number of strong cadres as the backbone, and it is necessary to educate them to pay attention to judicial work and help them improve their policy level. In areas where land reform is being carried out, more attention should be paid to the allocation of people's court cadres. In the future, when local authorities transfer key judicial cadres, they should obtain the consent of the higher-level judicial departments in advance. At present, there is a shortage of judicial cadres, and efforts should be made to gradually enrich them from several aspects. In addition to striving to improve the teaching content and methods of law departments in various universities to make them more practical, the people's governments above the provincial level should immediately start helping the judicial departments train cadres. When absorbing old judicial workers to participate in the work, they must first be educated and reformed, and then employed according to their abilities. When absorbing young men and women intellectuals to participate in the work, it is necessary to strengthen their training. In addition, such as forensic doctors and inspectors, can take the form of transferring cadres to lectures or jointly running training courses with the health department, and gradually seek solutions.

　　5. In the future, judicial funds will be paid by the state treasury; all judicial fines, confiscated property, and other income should be uniformly turned over to the state treasury.

　　Regarding the management of prisons, it is generally appropriate for the public security department to be responsible for it, and at the same time be guided by the judicial department. The people's governments above the provincial level should make appropriate decisions based on the specific circumstances of each region.

### 中央人民政府政务院  关于加强人民司法工作的指示

　　中央人民政府政务院
    关于加强人民司法工作的指示
    七、八月间第一次全国司法工作会议，曾经讨论了目前各地有关人民司法工作的一些主要问题，对人民司法的政策观点、工作方针与工作任务，已获得了初步的统一的结论。现在为了加强人民司法工作的建设，特作如下指示：
    一、为着保卫人民民主革命的胜利，镇压反革命活动，巩固新社会秩序及保护人民合法权益，人民的司法工作如同人民军队和人民警察一样，是人民政权的重要工具之一。因此，各级人民政府必须切实地领导和加强这一工作，并采取必要办法，使人民司法制度在全国范围内有系统地逐步地建立和健全起来，对这一工作采取轻视态度是错误的。
    二、为了正确地从事人民司法工作的建设，首先必须划清新旧法律的原则界限。法律是一定统治阶级用来统治被统治阶级和保护自己阶级的工具。一切国民党反动政府的法律，都是为少数人的反动集团用来压迫中国广大人民的工具。人民法律则是代表广大人民的意旨的法律，教育人民尊重新民主主义的社会秩序，并为保护广大人民的利益而与少数反动分子的破坏作斗争。两种根本不同的法律原则绝不容混淆在一个观念里，有这种混淆观念的人就不能正确地从事人民司法工作的建设。因此，一切政府工作人员在新旧法律界限划分上保存着任何模糊的观点，都是不应该的。目前，我们国家新的法律还不能立求完备，但如基本大法中国人民政协共同纲领及中央人民政府委员会、政务院、最高人民法院及其他机关所发布的许多法律、法令、指示、决定，都是人民司法工作的重要依据。这是根据马列主义的国家学说和对中国实际情况（阶级关系、社会经济关系等）的具体分析而逐渐产生出来的。人民司法建设工作者必须在实践中一面澄清那些旧的反动法律的观点及其影响，一面不断总结经验，研究判例，以便中央人民政府能够逐渐制订完备的新的法律。
    三、人民司法工作的当前主要任务，是镇压反动，保护人民。对反革命分子来说，首先是镇压，只有镇压才能使他们服罪，只有在他们服罪之后，才能谈到宽大。宽大只能结合着镇压来进行，有些地区发生“宽大无边”的偏向，是必须纠正的。在镇压时，分别轻重，分别首要与胁从，是必要的，但在解放以后一切进行反革命活动的分子均必须予以惩办。人民司法工作的任务，是惩罚犯罪，保护善良。对破坏国家的建设和财产及破坏社会秩序和侵害人民正当权益的犯罪者，必须给以惩罚，只有惩罚才能使他们认罪，只有在他们认罪之后，才能谈到教育改造。教育只能结合着惩罚来进行，片面地强调“教育改造”是不对的；在惩罚认罪之后，忽视教育改造工作，也是必须纠正的。人民司法工作还须处理人民间的纠纷，对这类民事案件，亦须予以足够的重视，一方面应尽量采取群众调解的办法以减少人民讼争，另一方面司法机关在工作中应力求贯彻群众路线，推行便利人民、联系人民和依靠人民的诉讼程序与各种审判制度。各级人民政府应定期听取司法机关的工作报告，各级人民司法机关在各级人民政府指导帮助及和有关部门工作的密切配合之下，应组织力量，加速案件审理的期限，坚决革除国民党法院所遗留的形式主义和因循拖延的作风。积极提高审案的质量，同时并应广泛进行法治的宣传教育工作，严格纠正违法乱纪现象的发生。不论政府机关、公务人员和人民，如有违法之事，均应受检查机关的检举。
    四、为加强人民司法工作，必须配备一定数量的坚强干部作为骨干，并须教育他们重视司法工作，帮助他们提高政策水平。在进行土地改革的地区，更应注意人民法庭干部的配备。今后各地调用司法工作主要干部时，应事前经上级司法部门的同意。目前司法干部缺乏，要从几方面逐渐求其充实，除力求改进各大学法律学系的教学内容和方法使其切合实际需要外，省以上人民政府应立即着手帮助司法部门训练干部。吸收旧司法工作人员参加工作时，必须先加教育改造，而后量才录用。吸收青年男女知识分子参加工作时，则须加强对他们的锻炼。此外，如法医、检验员等，均可采取抽调干部讲习或会同卫生部门办训练班等方式，逐步求得解决。
    五、今后司法经费，由国库开支；所有司法罚款、没收财产等收入，均应统一缴归国库。
    关于监所管理，目前一般宜归公安部门负责，兼受司法部门指导，由省以上人民政府依各地具体情况适当决定之。
