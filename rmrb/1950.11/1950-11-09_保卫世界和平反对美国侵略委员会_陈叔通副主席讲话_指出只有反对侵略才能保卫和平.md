[Beijing News Agency] Speech by Chen Shutong, Vice-Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for Defending World Peace and Opposing American Aggression, at the inaugural meeting of the Beijing Branch. The full text is as follows:

　　Today, the Beijing Branch of the Committee to Defend World Peace and Oppose American Aggression is established. I would like to explain that the defense of world peace and opposition to American aggression were originally led by two organizations. Because defending world peace and opposing American aggression are inseparable, after a long period of deliberation, they merged into one organization. We want peace, but American imperialism is the first to undermine peace through aggression. Therefore, if we want to defend peace, we must oppose American imperialism's aggression. The Korean situation is clear evidence. Korea wants independence and freedom and opposes the Lee Seung-man puppet government manipulated by American imperialism. This is an internal matter of Korea and does not involve aggression against any country. American imperialism has forgotten that it gained independence by breaking away from British rule. Instead, it launched an offensive against Korea's independence and freedom, crossed the 38th parallel, and even approached our border. No matter how they try to explain it, it cannot be denied that this is aggression. Originally, after World War II, the United Nations was established to strive for peace, but under the manipulation of American imperialism, this United Nations, which was meant to strive for peace, has become an organization of an aggressive group, opposing the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union. As a result, the Soviet Union's peace proposal was openly rejected at this conference. Therefore, the World Peace Congress has taken on the great responsibility of striving for peace. The World Peace Congress is expanding and strengthening day by day. More and more people who love peace in the aggressive group, such as the people of the United States, Britain, and France, are joining the World Peace Congress. The power to defend peace is inviolable. In other words, the power to oppose American imperialism's aggression is inviolable. The recent voluntary actions of various places in our country to aid Korea demonstrate that only by resisting aggression can we defend peace. American imperialism simply does not believe in the power of the people and only sees gold, dollars, planes, warships, cannons, tanks, and even atomic bombs as omnipotent. We are not saying that we do not need weapons, but the power of the people is strong and vast, and with the power of the people, the enemy's weapons become our weapons. We believe that victory belongs to us because we rely on the power of the people. The World Peace Congress will soon be held in Britain according to plan. I think Britain cannot refuse to allow the conference to be held in Britain. If it does not allow representatives from various countries to enter Britain for the World Peace Congress, or restricts a portion of them from entering, it will be the imperialists showing a kind of fear and weakness. At the same time, it will further demonstrate that defending peace is enough to awaken the sympathy of the people all over the world. In recent days, the joint declarations of various parties and the volunteer army movements in various places are certainly for aiding Korea, but also for defending the homeland. The establishment of peace defense and anti-American aggression branches in various places is mainly to cooperate with the people's anti-aggression movement in various places, that is, to cooperate with the people's movement to defend peace in various places. Our struggle against American imperialism's aggression is a struggle to defend peace. Aiding Korea is the first step in the struggle against American imperialism's aggression and for defending world peace.

　　保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会
    陈叔通副主席讲话
    指出只有反对侵略才能保卫和平
    【京市新闻处讯】中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会陈叔通副主席在北京市分会成立大会上的讲话，全文如下：
    今天北京市成立保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会分会。我想就此说明：保卫和平，反对美国侵略原来是由两个团体领导的。因为保卫世界和平与反美侵略是分不开的，所以经过了好久的酝酿合并为一个机构。我们要和平，而美帝国主义首先以侵略来破坏和平。因之我们要保卫和平就得反对美帝的侵略。朝鲜的事便是明证。朝鲜要独立、要自由，反对美帝操纵的李承晚傀儡政府，这是朝鲜内部的事，并没有侵略任何国家。美帝忘了自己是脱离英国统治而独立的，反而对于朝鲜的独立自由发动进攻，越过三八线，甚至逼近了我国的边境。如果说这不是侵略，无论他怎样说也说不过去。本来第二次大战以后，为了争取和平所以有联合国这个机构，但是在美帝的操纵之下，把这个争取和平的联合国变成了侵略集团的机构，来反对以苏联为首的和平民主阵营，以致这次大会苏联提出和平方案公然在大会上被否决。因此世界保卫和平大会便肩负起争取和平的伟大责任，世界保卫和平大会一天比一天扩大，一天比一天加强，在侵略集团中爱好和平的人民如美、英、法等国的人民加入保卫和平大会的一天比一天多。保卫和平的力量是不可侮的。也就是反对美帝侵略的力量是不可侮的。近来我国各地方志愿援朝的行动就是认清了只有反抗侵略才能保卫和平。美帝国主义就是不相信人民力量，而只看见了金元飞机兵舰大炮坦克车乃至原子弹是万能的。我们不是说不要武器，可是人民力量是坚强的，是庞大的，并且有了人民的力量，敌人的武器就是我们的武器。我们相信胜利归于我们，就是因为我们依靠人民的力量。不久世界保卫和平大会将要按预定计划在英国开会了，我想英国是不能不容许和大在英国开会的，要是不容许世界保卫和平大会的各国代表进入英国，或者限制一部分进去，便是帝国主义者表示一种畏怯软弱，同时更显得保卫和平是足以唤起全世界人民的同情的。近日来我国各党派的联合宣言以及各地的志愿参军运动固然是为了援朝，也是保家卫国，各地保卫和平反美侵略分会的成立，主要是配合各地方人民反对侵略的运动，也就是为配合各地人民保卫和平的运动。我们要为反对美帝侵略而奋斗，就是为保卫和平而奋斗。援朝是为反对美帝侵略，保卫世界和平而奋斗的第一步。
