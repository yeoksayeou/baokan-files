　　Fighting Against Snow Mountains and Glaciers, Resolutely Marching into Tibet!
    ·Lü Liang·
    The difficulties encountered in the natural environment during the march into Tibet are unprecedented for the People's Liberation Army in any previous military operation. A large amount of supplies supporting the advancing troops – grain, ammunition, oil, salt, dry rations, shoes, newspapers, even tea and chili peppers… – all had to be transported by vehicles and livestock over the nearly perpetually snow-covered Erlang Mountain (over 3,000 meters high), Zheduo Mountain (over 4,000 meters high), and other large and small mountain ranges, and across the notoriously dangerous Dadu River (with a flow rate of 7 meters per second), as well as countless glaciers. When climbing steep mountain slopes, vehicles could only travel five kilometers per hour. In narrow sections of the road, the outer wheels of trucks were almost suspended in the air. River crossings were accomplished via various types of bridges: wooden plank bridges, stone bridges, iron chain bridges, as well as single-log bridges and single-rope bridges. When cars could not pass the Dadu River, things had to be unloaded, and cars disassembled into parts, each piece carried across iron chain bridges, small boats, and pontoon bridges made of rubber boats, before being reassembled and continuing forward. Resilient transport team members would rather get soaked themselves than let the supplies get wet in the torrential rain, covering the grain with cotton clothing. To support the liberation of Tibet, the tenacious transport teams are advancing, overcoming all difficulties. Sometimes, when land transport couldn’t keep up, aircraft had to brave snow, ice and hail to conduct airdrops from altitudes of over 20,000 feet.

    Resolute and tenacious engineers and construction workers, enduring untold hardships, are opening roads in the snowy mountains and grasslands for transport and combat troops. With such arduous support, the troops are undertaking a resolute and heroic march. Cadres and soldiers alike carry over eighty pounds of grain and weapons, crossing mountains and rivers, following the glorious path of the old Red Army's Long March, and entering the Tibetan-inhabited areas. When crossing Erlang Mountain, soldiers used bayonets to dig through the snow to clear the way. When crossing Zheduo Mountain, the soldiers' faces were frozen and swollen. But they overcame these difficulties and continued to advance tenaciously. In the sparsely populated, barren, and impoverished Tibetan areas, the soldiers are carrying forward the tradition of hard struggle of the old Red Army. They prioritize the lives of the people, unwilling to add to the burdens of the Tibetan people. A vanguard unit ate only one pound of highland barley flour per person per day, supplementing it with coarse grains and wild vegetables. Because the People's Liberation Army resolutely implemented national policies and mass discipline, a deep friendship was established between the Tibetan people and the People's Liberation Army. The troops are warmly welcomed by the Tibetan people wherever they go.

    The determination to liberate the Tibetan people and build Kangzang inspires every officer and soldier marching into Tibet. They are bringing many grain seeds and vegetable seeds, setting up supply stations along the way, and building solid tents and houses. They are determined to turn supply stations into villages and towns, small paths into highways, and bring culture to the Tibetan people. Inspired by the spirit of the Soviet people in opening up Siberia, they are taking a great first step towards building a bright future for the Kangzang region.

　　与雪山冰河搏斗，向西藏坚决进军！
    ·吕梁·
    进军西藏所遇到的大自然环境的困难，是人民解放军在任何一次进军作战中所没有碰到过的。支援进军部队的大宗的粮食、弹药、油盐、干粮、鞋子、书报，以至茶叶、辣椒………都要用车辆和牲口运载着越过几乎是终年积雪的高达三千多公尺的二郎山、四千多公尺的折多山，以及其他大小山岭，渡过以险恶著名的流速达每秒七公尺的大渡河，以及无数的冰河。翻越大山陡坡时，汽车每小时只能走五公里，路窄的地方，卡车的外轮几乎是悬空着过的。渡河是通过着各式各样的桥梁：木板桥、石桥、铁索桥，还有独木桥、独索桥。汽车在大渡河边无法通过，只得把东西卸下，把汽车拆成零件，一件件从铁索桥上、小船上和橡皮船联成的浮桥上搬过去，然后再装好继续前进。坚忍的运输队员们不让物资被暴雨淋湿，把棉衣盖在粮食上，宁可自己挨淋。为了支援解放西藏，顽强的运输队，战胜一切困难前进着。有时陆上运输接济不上，还要依靠飞机冒着风雪冰雹，飞越二万英尺以上的高空进行空投。
    坚毅顽强的工兵和工程师们，历尽千辛万苦，在雪山草地中为运输部队和战斗部队开辟道路。在这样艰苦的支援下，部队进行着坚毅英勇的进军。干部和战士们每人都背着八十多斤重的粮食、武器，翻山过河，经过老红军长征时代走过的光荣道路，进入藏胞区。翻过二郎山时，战士们用刺刀挖雪开路。翻越折多山时，战士们的脸都冻肿了。但他们都克服了这些困难，顽强地前进着。在人口稀少、地瘠民贫的藏胞区，战士们发扬了老红军时代的艰苦奋斗的传统，他们要首先照顾人民生活，不愿给藏胞加重负担。先遣队某部每人每天只吃一斤青稞粉，用杂粮配以野菜充饥。由于解放军坚决地执行了民族政策和群众纪律，藏胞和解放军之间建立了深厚的友谊。部队每到一个地方，都受到藏胞们热烈的迎送。
    解放藏胞、建设康藏的决心，激励着每一个进军西藏的指战员们。他们带着很多粮食种和菜籽，沿途设立兵站，建立起坚固的帐篷和房屋。他们决心要把兵站变成村镇，把小路变成公路，把文化带给藏胞。他们以学习苏联人民开辟西伯利亚的精神，为建设康藏地区美好的将来，正在迈开伟大的第一步。
