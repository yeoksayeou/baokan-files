Cheng Yongfang Innocently Stabbed Three Times by American Soldiers
　　Xu Luwen

　　This is not a story, but a living fact, one of the countless atrocities committed by American imperialism. For decades, American imperialism has created countless bloody cases in China, and the Shanghai Bund is stained with the blood and tears of our people. Hatred is planted in the hearts of the people. Today, the American imperialist war of aggression has expanded to our northeastern border, and resisting America and aiding Korea has become our united voice.

　　Less than a hundred days after the Zang Dayaozi blood case, on New Year's Day in 1947, at the intersection of Huade Road and Zhaofeng Road, Cheng Yongfang, a kind and innocent rickshaw worker, was stabbed three times by an American sailor. After more than half a year of treatment, he luckily escaped from death. However, the severe injuries have prevented him from doing heavy work to this day. In the cold and rainy autumn season, the old wounds often ache faintly.

　　On New Year's Day in 1947, Cheng Yongfang thought he could make good business that night, and waited patiently at the entrance of the Haibin pub on Dongdaming Road. It was already past 10:30, and the pub business was still booming. Outside the dim red and green windows, one could still hear the lewd and shameless jokes and the decadent jazz music inside. At this moment, two American sailors staggered out of the door (one of whom was named Lauges). They were also escorting the "Haibin" pub girl, and the three half-drunk people sat together on Cheng Yongfang's rickshaw. Cheng Yongfang was a thin, small man, and the rickshaw seat could not accommodate three people, but what reason was there to reason with unreasonable sailors?

　　　　Bestial Soldiers and Bestial Acts of Drawing Knives to Stab People

　　Cheng Yongfang tried his best to pull the three people to the intersection of Huade Road and Zhaofeng Road, panting heavily. He had no strength to continue. Unexpectedly, this angered the sailors, who roared loudly in the rickshaw and kept cursing. Cheng Yongfang's experiences and explanations did not win their sympathy and forgiveness, but instead provoked their atrocities. Lauges and another sailor jumped out of the rickshaw and punched Cheng Yongfang. Lauges even drew a five-inch-long knife from his body and stabbed Cheng Yongfang three times. Cheng Yongfang was beaten by two sailors and stabbed three times by Lauges in the chest and abdomen, and fell to the ground bleeding and unconscious. At this time, nearby rickshaw workers and audience members who came out of the Guoguang Theater gathered around the murderer. Some people were indignant and wanted to beat the sailors. Later, the two murderers and the pub girl were taken away by the Tilanqiao puppet police. Cheng Yongfang was carried by the workers and the audience to a nearby clinic, where he received two emergency injections.

　　After the emergency treatment, the injuries were still very serious. The clinic called the puppet police station to send an ambulance to take Cheng Yongfang to Gongji Hospital. Gongji Hospital performed surgery that night to stitch up Cheng Yongfang's stabbed abdomen. By the time the formalities were completed, it was already three o'clock the next morning.

　　　　The Murderous Killer Was Released Without Guilt

　　Cheng Yongfang's family lived in Zhabei, with a sixty-two-year-old father and a wife. His elder brother, Cheng Yongquan, worked as a waiter in the Shengping Tea Garden on Yangshou Road in Hudong. At twelve o'clock that night, a rickshaw worker rushed to tell Cheng Yongquan. When Cheng Yongquan arrived at Gongji Hospital, he only saw that his brother was seriously injured and his face was completely changed. He said: "When my brother came out of the operating room after the operation, his face was pale and bloodless, and his body was very thin because of excessive bleeding. I was extremely angry at the time!"

　　The next day, all the people in Shanghai were aroused with anger. Students from Jiaotong University and Fudan University went to the hospital to visit Cheng Yongfang and donated money for his treatment. At that time, another murderer and the pub girl had been released on bail. Lauges was transferred from the Tilanqiao Police Station to the Lujiawan Police Station, but Lauges "rested" in the Lujiawan Police Station for three months. Because the Chiang Kai-shek gang flattered the United States and did not dare to offend the master, he was actually released without guilt.

　　Cheng Yongquan ran around for his brother's bloody case. But at that time, under the control of the Kuomintang reactionaries, there was no way to redress grievances. Shui Xiangyun, the chairman of the puppet General Labor Union, hypocritically comforted Cheng Yongquan and gave him 200,000 puppet legal tender (equivalent to one dan of rice) as travel expenses for the prosecution, and introduced three lawyers to file a lawsuit for Cheng Yongfang. At that time, although a complaint was filed with the court, what effect could it have?

　　　　Five American Soldiers Forced to Sign with Guns

　　The U.S. military also hired a lawyer to "defend". According to Cheng Yongquan, a few days after the incident, the lawyer hired by the U.S. military and the U.S. military took Cheng Yongquan to the U.S. military club in the New Asia Hotel for negotiations, and invited Cheng Yongquan to eat a big meal. The shameless lawyer also said to Cheng Yongquan: "As long as the matter is settled, it doesn't matter if you use all the U.S. dollars." At that time, Cheng Yongquan refused.

　　Seeing that bribery was unsuccessful, the U.S. military sent five American sailors to Gongji Hospital on January 10, and moved Cheng Yongfang from the third-floor third-class ward to a secluded room on the fifth floor. They threatened Cheng Yongfang with guns, saying, "Sign your name on this paper, or we will kill you." Under the threat of force at the time, Cheng Yongfang had to sign his name on a blank piece of paper.

　　When Cheng Yongquan learned of this that day, he asked a lawyer to submit a document to the court denying the validity of the signature, and questioned Gongji Hospital why it easily allowed the U.S. military to force his brother to sign, but Gongji Hospital excused itself that it had no power to stop it.

　　The court dragged the case on, and only held several hearings on January 30 and February 20. The presiding judge perfunctorily handled the matter and said that Cheng Yongfang had signed to give up the prosecution. Cheng Yongquan rushed to the Suzhou Higher Court to appeal, but it was not accepted; later, he appealed to the Shanghai Higher Court, but it was also not accepted. Cheng Yongquan was in great pain in this situation. At that time, students from Jiaotong University and Fudan University were preparing to ask the school's legal counsel to file an appeal on their behalf, but Shui Xiangyun asked Cheng Yongquan to stop them, saying: "Our General Labor Union will handle it."

　　　　Facts Written in Blood Cannot Be Covered Up!

　　In April, the court announced a verdict, obliterating the facts and saying: "Cheng Yongfang voluntarily gave up the appeal." Cheng Yongfang and Cheng Yongquan had no place to appeal their grievances. Truth was originally non-existent in the hands of the reactionaries, and even more shameful, the bandit leader Shui Xiangyun also said to Cheng Yongquan: "American soldiers have U.S. dollars, so naturally they can settle it. What can we do?"

　　The monstrous bloody case was thus covered up by the U.S. imperialists and the reactionaries. The U.S. military only paid Cheng Yongfang's medical expenses and that was the end of it. Cheng Yongfang was discharged from Gongji Hospital after living there for nearly half a year, but because his lungs and abdomen were injured, he could no longer pull a rickshaw. A twenty-five-year-old young man was thus ruined by American soldiers. Currently, he only makes a small business selling sugarcane and oranges to make a living, but the income is not enough for one person to eat. When reporters interviewed him yesterday, he expressed his anger, saying: "Old hatred plus new hatred can only be repaid with blood!"

　　Rickshaw workers Xing Wenzhou, Li Guoqiang, Lu Sanxi, Xie Shunhe, Zhou Yinsheng, Liu Dengquan, and others who were often with Cheng Yongfang were very clear about Cheng Yongfang's suffering and unanimously expressed sympathy and resentment. They said: "We will take practical actions to打击打美帝 (Dǎjí měidì)" [Translator note: The original uses "打击美帝", which can translate to, "Strike at American imperialism"].

　　程永芳无辜被美兵刺了三刀
　　许鲁文
    这不是一个故事，而是一件活生生的事实，是千万桩美帝暴行中的一件。数十年来美帝在中国制造了无数血案，上海滩处处沾染了我们人民的血泪，仇恨种在人民心里。今天美帝侵略战争又扩大到了我们东北国境，抗美援朝已经成为我们一个声音了。
    距离臧大咬子血案还不满一百天，在一九四七年的元旦晚上，华德路兆丰路口，一位善良无辜的三轮车工友程永芳又被美帝烂水手，刺了三刀，半年多的医治，他侥幸从死里逃生。但惨重的创伤，使他一直到今还不能做较重的工作，阴寒秋雨时节，旧伤常常隐隐作痛。
    一九四七年元旦晚上，程永芳以为有一晚好生意可做，静心的等候在东大名路海滨酒排间门口，当时已经十点半多了，酒排间生意还正上市，灰暗的红绿窗外，还可以听到里面荒淫无耻的调笑和靡靡之音的爵士音乐，这时门里踉跄的闯出来二个美国烂水手（其中一个人的名字叫劳吉士），他们中间还手挟着“海滨”的酒排女郎，就这样三个半醉的人一起坐上了程永芳的三轮车，程永芳是一个消瘦的小个子，而车座也挤不下三个人，可是，碰到蛮不讲理的烂水手，又有什么理好讲呢？
            兽兵兽行拔刀刺人
    程永芳拚着最大的力量，把三个人踏到了华德路兆丰路口，满头大汗气喘不止，他再也没有力量继续踏下去。可想不到这事情激怒了烂水手，他们在车上大声咆哮，并不断骂人。程永芳的遭遇与解释，并没有使他们同情与原谅，反而激起了他们的暴行，劳吉士与另一个水手居然跳下车来，举拳围打程永芳，劳吉士更从身上抽出随身的五寸余长小刀，猛刺程永芳三刀。程永芳经过二个烂水手围打，又被劳吉士在胸腹间刺了三刀，当场流血昏倒地上。这时附近的三轮车工友，和国光戏院散戏出来的观众都赶过来围住了凶手，更有人忿忿不平要打烂水手，后来凶手二人及酒排女郎由提篮桥伪警察带了去。程永芳由工友和观众将他抬到附近一个诊所里，打了二针急救针。
    急救之后，伤势仍很严重，诊所打电话给伪警局派救护车将程永芳送到公济医院。公济医院即在当天晚上开刀，将程永芳被刺伤的腹部缝补起来，等手续完毕已经第二天早上三点钟了。
            杀人的凶手无罪释放了
    程永芳家里住在闸北，有一位六十二岁父亲和一位妻子。他的亲哥哥程永全，在沪东扬州路升平茶园内做伙计，这天晚上十二点时有一位三轮车工友赶来告诉了程永全。等程永全赶到公济医院时，只看到他的弟弟受伤严重，面目完全变了样，他说：“我弟弟开刀后从手术间出来时，脸面惨白，一无血色，身上也因为流血过多，瘦得厉害，我当时气愤极了！”
    第二天全上海人民都激起了愤怒，交大、复旦的同学并到医院里去慰问程永芳，并捐款给他治伤。当时另一个凶手和酒排女郎已经交保后释放。劳吉士由提篮桥警局转押卢家湾警局，可是劳吉士在卢家湾警局“休养”了三个月后，因为蒋匪帮的媚美，不敢得罪主子，居然以无罪而开释了。
    程永全为了弟弟的血案，四出奔走。但当时在国民党反动派统制下，有冤伸不清，伪总工会理事长水祥云假惺惺地安慰程永全，给了二十万伪法币（合米一担）算是起诉用的车马费，并介绍了三位律师为程永芳起诉，那时候虽也做了起诉书送到法院，可是能有什么效用呢？
            五个美国兵持枪逼签字
    美军方面也请了一个律师“辩护”，据程永全说，在出事后数天，美军请的律师和美军将程永全接到新亚酒楼美军俱乐部谈判，并请程永全吃大菜，那个不要脸的律师还给程永全说：“只要事体太平，美金用脱一眼呒末关系。”当时程永全拒绝了。
    美军眼看用贿不成，就在一月十日，五个美国烂水手到了公济医院，将程永芳自三楼三等病房移到五楼僻室内，用手枪威迫程永芳，说：“你在这纸上签个名字，否则就打死你。”程永芳在当时武力威迫下，只好在一张白纸上签了字。
    当天程永全知道这事后，一面请律师上文向法院否认签字有效，一面责问公济医院，为什么轻易让美军威迫他的弟弟签字，而公济医院就推脱没有阻止力量。
    法院把这件案子拖了下去，只有在一月三十日和二月二十日开了几次庭，主其事的推事推诿敷衍，马虎地处理此事，并说程永芳已签字放弃起诉追究。程永全又赶去苏州高等法院申诉，可是不受理；后来又向上海高等法院申诉，又不受理。程永全在这种处境下，真是痛苦万分。当时交大与复旦同学准备请学校法律顾问代为申诉，可是水祥云要程永全阻止他们，并说：“自有我们总工会办理。”
            血写的事实是掩盖不了的！
    四月中法院宣判，抹杀事实的说：“程永芳自请放弃申诉。”程永芳与程永全听了有冤无处申诉，真理在反动派手下本来是没有的，而更可耻的匪首水祥云还给程永全说：“人家美国兵有美钞，自然摆得平，我伲有啥办法？”
    滔天血案就这样被美帝与反动派一手掩盖下去。美军只付了程永芳的医药费就算完事。程永芳在公济医院住了近半年后才出院，可是因肺部与腹部都受了伤害，三轮车已无法再踏了。一个二十五岁的小伙子就这样给美国兵毁了，目前只做些甘蔗和橘子的小生意过活，可是收入还不够一个人吃饭。昨天当记者访问他时，他表示出满腔的愤怒，他说：“旧恨加上新仇，用血才能偿还血债！”
    与程永芳常在一起的三轮车工友邢文周、李国强、陆三喜、解顺和、周银生、刘登全等，他们对于程永芳的受害都非常清楚，一致表示同情与愤恨，他们说：“我们要以实际的行动来打击美帝。”
