Xinhua News Agency, London, November 9th: The British bourgeoisie and right-wing Labour Party members are intensifying their efforts to undermine the British peace movement. The Daily Worker reports: The first group of three female delegates from the United States to the Second World Peace Congress arrived in London on the 5th. While welcoming the Brazilian delegation at the docks, they were intercepted by British immigration authorities, who took them back to the Queen Mary ship for lengthy interrogation.

Various newspapers report that the British Steel Corporation, Sheffield's largest steel plant, posted a notice on the 6th warning workers not to attend the Peace Congress, or they would be "disciplined." The "Thomas Clarke & Sons Ltd." factory in Sheffield notified Crawford, the representative of the Sheffield branch of the Foundry Workers Union attending the Congress, that the factory would not allow him to take leave to attend the conference.

However, the British workers' peace movement is developing extensively. Four hundred workers at the Metropolitan-Vickers machine manufacturing plant in Manchester have elected Wilcox from Stretford to attend the Second World Peace Congress. His expenses will be borne by the factory workers. According to the Daily Telegraph & Morning Post, the British Steel Industry Union Committee has selected union committee member Howarth as a delegate to attend the conference. According to the Daily Worker, Mrs. McLellan, secretary of the Prestwick Labour Party Women's Section, has left the Labour Party, protesting the Labour Party leaders' attitude towards the Peace Congress. She said, "If I stayed in the Labour Party, I would be a hypocrite." McLellan, a Labour Party member for thirteen years, told the Daily Worker reporter, "Since the Korean War, I can no longer stay in the Labour Party. There are many people like me in the Labour Party."

　　英人民不顾统治阶级的恫吓胁迫
    热烈拥护二届和大
    继续推选出席二届和大代表
    【新华社九日讯】据塔斯社伦敦八日讯：英国资产阶级和右翼工党分子正加紧破坏英国和平运动。工人日报报道：美国出席第二届世界保卫和平大会的首批三位女代表已于五日抵达伦敦。她们在码头上欢迎巴西代表团时，却遭到英国移民当局的拦截，把她们带回玛丽皇后号船上加以长时间的盘问。
    各报载称：设菲尔德最大的炼钢厂英国炼钢公司于六日张贴布告，警告工人不得参加保卫和平大会，否则将被“惩戒”。设菲尔德的“托马斯·克拉克父子有限公司”的工厂通知铸造工人联合会设菲尔德分会出席和大的代表克劳福特称：工厂不准他请假出席大会。
    但是英国工人的和平运动正在广泛开展着。曼彻斯特的梅特罗维克斯机器制造厂的四百名工人已推选斯特雷特福德的威尔科克斯出席第二届世界保卫和平大会。他的费用将由该厂的工人担负。据《每日电讯晨邮报》报道，英国炼钢业工会委员会已选派工会委员霍华斯为出席大会代表。《工人日报》消息称：普累斯特威治工党妇女部书记麦雷尔夫人已经脱离工党。表示抗议工党领袖对和大的态度。她说：“如果我还留在工党就是一个伪善者。”有十三年党龄的工党党员麦雷尔告工人日报记者称：“自从朝鲜事件发生以后。我就不能再在工党里面了。工党里面有很多像我这样的人。”
