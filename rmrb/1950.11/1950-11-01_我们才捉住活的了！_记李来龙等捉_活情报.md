　　"We've captured them alive!"
    ——A Record of Li Lailong and Others Capturing "Live Intelligence"
    Han Xiliang
    "To successfully complete any battle, the first thing is to understand the enemy's situation and the terrain. The scouts are the eyes and ears of the commanders, constantly providing them with information so they can correctly deploy the battle." Li Lailong, the resourceful and courageous reconnaissance company commander of a certain unit of the Second Field Army, began his report like this - a report on capturing the enemy alive during the Linfen battle.
    "In February 1948, our troops approached the outskirts of Linfen and controlled the Yaomiao Airport; the south gate of Linfen was not far from us.
    "There was a large temple in Yaomiao, and the division headquarters set up an observation post here. Although we could see the enemy's fortifications from here, we were not clear about the enemy's troop deployment and construction. Commander Huang said to me, 'You send three people to Xizhao Village to capture two prisoners.'
    "Xizhao Village is located more than half a kilometer southeast of Linfen, and the village is triangular in shape. The village was full of bunkers. The bunkers were surrounded by chevaux-de-frise, barbed wire, horse pits, and landmines.
    "The two people who went with me were both Communist Party members: one was squad leader Li Yushan from the seventh squad, and the other was the Party's group leader, Tao Youcheng. The three of us disguised ourselves as the enemy, hid in the wheat field outside the village, and observed the terrain and the enemy's movements. After dark, we only heard the enemy's liaison whistles; we couldn't hear human voices. I thought to myself: There isn't a single哨兵 [sentry] at the village entrance; where are we going to capture 'live intelligence'? I had observed the enemy's fortifications and estimated that there was a company of soldiers inside, and it would be difficult for the three of us to take down the enemy's bunker. Before dark, we had seen smoke coming from a house in the village, so we decided to go into the village first.
    "When we got to the chevaux-de-frise, Li Yushan stayed behind to monitor the enemy and guard the road; he also cut the barbed wire so that we could pass through it when we returned. Tao Youcheng and I crawled into the village.
    "We crawled to the middle of the village and didn't see a single enemy soldier; we only heard whistles from the bunkers for liaison, and they were constantly firing signal flares and shooting. When we crawled between two enemy bunkers, I suddenly bumped into a few ropes. It turned out they were tripwires. I took out my scissors, cut the ropes, and crawled forward.
    "After we entered the village, we stood up and swaggered along. The enemy's combat troops had all entered the bunkers. Turning a corner, we only saw a cave dwelling with a light on. We took off our shoes and went down into the cave. The family with the light on had their door closed. I used my saliva to lick a small hole in the window paper, and when I looked inside, there were three enemy soldiers talking, none of them carrying guns. The two of us swaggered into the house.
    "The enemy asked us what we were doing. I took out my pistol, put on a stern face, and said, 'The situation outside is so tense, there are so many Eighth Route Army soldiers, why aren't you going to the bunkers? Do you want to be prisoners? Hurry up and go!'
    "The enemy hurriedly replied, 'Yes, we'll pack our things.'
    "I said, 'Don't pack, you'll be back tomorrow.'
    "Tao Youcheng and I pulled two of the enemy soldiers away, and the other one followed in a daze.
    "When we got to fifty meters from the chevaux-de-frise - the barbed wire had already been cut by Li Yushan who stayed behind - the enemy saw that something was wrong and said, 'This isn't the way to the bunker, why are we going to Yaomiao?'
    "I took out my pistol and forced him to stop, saying, 'Don't shout, hurry up.' At this time, the enemy's guns fired from the bunker, and they shouted, 'Capture them alive, capture them alive.' I thought to myself: We've captured them alive.
    "Li Yushan, who stayed by the chevaux-de-frise, ran up and grabbed the third enemy soldier. We ran out of the chevaux-de-frise and rested in a small ditch. The enemy was trembling with fear. I said to them, 'We are the People's Liberation Army, we treat prisoners leniently, don't be afraid.'
    "I sent the 'live intelligence' to the operations section of the division. From these three 'live intelligence' sources, the commanders learned about the enemy's troop deployment and fortification construction on the southern mountain line of Linfen. Our army immediately began new attack preparations."

### “我们才捉住活的了！”——记李来龙等捉“活情报”

　　“我们才捉住活的了！”
    ——记李来龙等捉“活情报”
    韩希梁
    “任何一个战斗的胜利完成，首先要了解敌情和地形。而侦察员们就是指挥员的耳目，不断供给指挥员情况，使指挥员能正确部署战斗。”第二野战军某部智勇双全的侦察连长李来龙，这样开始了他的报告——关于临汾战斗中活捉敌人的报告。
    “一九四八年二月，我们部队逼近了临汾外围，控制了窑庙飞机场；临汾南门离我们不远了。
    “窑庙有个大庙，师部在这里设了一个观察所。在这里虽能看到敌人的工事，但对敌人的兵力配备和工事构筑情形还不清楚。黄师长对我说：“你们派三个人到西赵村，去抓两个俘虏来。”
    “西赵村在临汾东南一里多地，村子是三角形的。村里筑满碉堡。碉堡外围有鹿砦、铁丝网、战马坑，并埋有地雷。
    “和我一起去的两个人，都是共产党员：一个是七班副李玉山，一个是党的小组长陶有成。我们三个都伪装成敌人，躲在村外麦地里，观察地形和敌人的动静。天黑之后，只听到敌人的联络哨声，人声就听不见了。我心里盘算：敌人在村口没个哨兵，到那里去抓“活情报”呢？我观察过敌人的工事，估计里面有一个连的兵力，我们三个人又难打下敌人的地堡。天黑以前，我们见过村里有一家冒过烟，我们就决定先进村去。
    “走到鹿砦边，李玉山就留下监视敌人，守住这条路；并把铁丝网剪了，以便我们回去时通过。我和陶有成往村里爬去。
    “我们爬到村子中间，连一个敌人也没见到，只听见碉堡上吹哨联络，并不断地打信号弹、打枪。在爬到敌人两个碉堡中间时，我一下碰上了几条绳。原来是拉雷，我掏出剪子把绳剪断了，又往前爬。
    “我们进村后，就站起来大摇大摆地走。敌人的战斗部队都已进了碉堡，一转弯，只望见一家窑洞里点着灯。我们把鞋脱了，就顺着窑下去了。点灯的那一家关着门。我用唾沫把窗纸舐开一个小洞，向里一望，里面正有三个敌人在说话，都没带枪。我俩就大模大样地进屋里去了。
    “敌人问我们干什么。我拿出手枪，板起脸说：“外面情况这样紧，八路这样多，你们还不赶快上碉堡，想当俘虏吗？赶快走！”
    “敌人慌慌忙忙地回答：‘是，把东西收拾收拾。’
    “我说：‘不要收拾了，明天还要下来的。’
    “我和陶有成拉了二个敌人就走，另外一个也迷迷糊糊地跟来了。
    “走到离鹿砦五十米的地方——铁丝早给留下的李玉山剪断了——敌人一看不对，说：‘上碉堡不走这里，上窑庙干啥？’
    “我把手枪掏出来逼住他说：‘不准喊，快走。’这时候，碉堡上敌人的枪响了，还喊叫：‘捉活的，捉活的。’我心想：我们才捉住活的了。
    “留在鹿砦边的李玉山跑上来，又抓住了第三个敌人。我们跑出鹿砦，在一条小沟里休息。敌人吓得直抖。我对他们说：‘我们是人民解放军，优待俘虏，不要怕。’
    “我把‘活情报’送到师的作战股。指挥员们从这三个‘活情报’身上，了解了阎匪在临汾南山一线的兵力备配和工事筑构情况。我军即开始了新的攻击准备工作。”
