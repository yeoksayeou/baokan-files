　　On Current Affairs Propaganda in Newspapers

　　The American imperialists are expanding their aggression in Korea, and the war is approaching our northeastern border. At this critical juncture, the people of the whole country, with a high degree of patriotism and internationalism, have risen up to launch the movement to Resist America and Aid Korea, and Defend Our Homes and Defend Our Country. The new situation has brought new tasks to newspaper work, and strengthening current affairs propaganda has become the main issue of newspaper work.

　　In the rectification movement of the past two or three months, some newspapers have examined their neglect of current affairs propaganda and have begun to improve it. The Hebei Daily reviewed one of the three prominent shortcomings of the newspaper in connecting with reality: "Current affairs propaganda is very poor. First of all, it is manifested in the fact that the news dispatches from the New China News Agency are published less, and they are not popularized, and the summaries are also very few. It has not played its due role in the current affairs education of the vast number of cadres and the masses. Some readers reflected: 'Hebei Daily has too little current affairs news, and it is not enjoyable to read.' Many other readers reflected that they 'cannot understand it'. Especially after the outbreak of the Korean War, both cadres and the masses were very concerned, but we did very little propaganda and education work. Secondly, we did not recognize the great political significance of political activities closely related to current affairs (such as the peace signature campaign), and we did not give it high priority in propaganda and reporting." In order to overcome these shortcomings, the Hebei Daily has increased the manpower for handling current affairs reports, expanded the coverage of current affairs propaganda, and started the work of popularizing and rewriting.

　　Such review and improvement are necessary and meaningful. Many newspapers also have the same shortcomings and should make the same improvements.

　　We must put current affairs political propaganda back in the first place, because serious events have occurred in our political life.

　　Half a year ago, under the circumstances at that time, we studied Lenin's thesis on newspaper work. When Lenin discussed the shortcomings of newspaper work in the one or two years after the victory of the October Revolution in the Soviet Union, he called for less talk about politics and more talk about economics. This criticism was equally pertinent to our newspapers at that time. However, the politics that Lenin asked to talk less about referred to "political agitation on old topics, empty talk about politics" after the victory of the revolution, rather than the major issue we are facing today, where the people of the whole country are concerned about the American invasion of Korea and the threat to our country's security. Such major issues cannot be talked about less.

　　Now, our newspapers have begun to strengthen the reports and discussions on current affairs. The Korean people's anti-aggression war, the Chinese people's patriotic movement to resist America and aid Korea, and the struggle of the people of the world to defend peace have constantly become important themes of the newspapers. However, some newspapers have not fully done this work in this regard. They do not pay enough attention to the Korean War. They have not given greater attention to the Xinhua News Agency's reports on the major victories of the Korean People's Army's counter-offensive and the movement of the local people against American imperialist aggression. Similar shortcomings make some of our newspapers unable to fully meet the people's urgent need to understand the development of current affairs, and cannot fully reflect the firm determination of the people of the whole country to resist America and aid Korea. Our propaganda is lagging behind the reality. Under today's conditions, our newspapers should pay attention to the reports on current affairs that have an increasing impact on the lives of our people, should expand the coverage of current affairs reports, and should publish those major and thrilling events in important positions in a powerful way to carry out thrilling propaganda. Small newspapers should also pay attention to the popularization of Xinhua News Agency's manuscripts, so that they can conduct current affairs propaganda completely and powerfully in a limited space.

　　We once opposed local newspapers from being divorced from local practical work, using a lot of space to publish national and worldwide news that has no practical impact on local life, and advocated that local newspapers should focus on reflecting the local people's life. But this does not mean that even events that have a major impact on local life should not be reported and discussed. Local work and local people's lives are often affected by the national and worldwide situation to varying degrees. Therefore, even in the period of peaceful construction, local newspapers must still use appropriate efforts to report and discuss relevant national and worldwide news in the execution of the localization policy. In today's situation, local newspapers should be responsible for telling the local people about the situation in Korea, so that they can be full of attention and confidence in the future of the country, and step up the various tasks related to the national interest. Some local newspapers have begun to do so. For example, the Northeast Daily on October 30 published two news reports entitled "Angry City of Coal and Iron" and "Express Our Hearts against American Imperialism", which vividly reported the practical actions of local workers and farmers in patriotism. Xinhua News Agency also broadcasted a newsletter with motivational power such as "The Fighting Zhao Guoyou Workshop". Every newspaper should learn this way of using concrete and vivid mass actions to make powerful political agitation.

　　Reactionary elements lurking are creating rumors, and the masses who are not clear about the truth of the situation also have some concerns and doubts. It is wrong to ignore these phenomena. The newspaper should use powerful propaganda to crush the rumors of reactionary elements and explain the doubts of the masses. In the past week or so, the Shanghai Liberation Daily has often answered readers' questions about current affairs in the mailbox, including such questions as: "The weaknesses of the American aggressors and the blows they have received," "Is the United States moving towards fascism? Is the fate of the United States better than that of Germany, Japan and Italy in the past?" "We are concentrating on construction, why bother to ask about international struggles? Is this idea and view correct?" The Northeast Daily also answered some readers' questions in the social service column, such as: "Is the American imperialist aggression against Korea and aggression against China the same thing?" "The democratic camp is stronger than the aggressive camp, why is it a minority vote in the United Nations?" In addition, the Shanghai News Daily and Ta Kung Pao have organized reader discussion meetings on current affairs, war and peace issues. Such work is beneficial and worth emulating.

　　With the expansion of aggression by American imperialism and the development of the national people's movement to resist America and aid Korea, political agitation on the current situation has become a serious task of the newspaper. In the past period, local newspapers mostly focused on the reports of economic construction in formulating plans and using manpower. Now this situation must be appropriately changed in order to make the newspaper the center of current affairs propaganda.

### 论报纸上的时事宣传

专栏：报纸述评

　　论报纸上的时事宣传
    美国帝国主义者在朝鲜扩大侵略，战争迫近我国东北边境。在这个严重的关头，全国人民以高度的爱国主义和国际主义的热情奋起展开了抗美援朝保家卫国运动。新的形势给报纸工作带来了新的任务，加强时事宣传已经成了报纸工作的主要问题了。
    在最近两三个月来的整风运动中，有些报纸检查了对于时事宣传的忽视，并着手加以改进。河北日报检讨报纸在联系实际上比较突出的三个缺点之一是“时事宣传很差。首先表现在对新华社的电讯稿登载既少，又没有加以通俗化，摘要也做得很少，对广大干部及群众的时事教育，没有发挥其应有的作用。有的读者反映：“河北日报时事新闻少，读起来不过瘾。”还有不少的读者反映“读不懂”。特别朝鲜战争爆发后，无论干部群众都非常关心，然而我们做的宣传教育工作却很少。其次还表现在与时事有密切关联的政治活动（如和平签名运动），我们也没有认识其重大的政治意义，宣传报道上也没有予以高度的重视。”为了克服这些缺点，河北日报已增强处理时事报道的人力，扩大了时事宣传的篇幅，并着手通俗化改写的工作。
    这样的检讨和改进是必要和有意义的。有许多报纸也存在着同样的缺点，应当进行同样的改进。
    必须把时事政治宣传重新提到第一位，因为我们的政治生活中发生了严重的事变。
    在半年以前，在当时的情况下，我们曾学习过列宁论报纸工作的论文。列宁在论及苏联十月革命胜利后的一两年中报纸工作的缺点时，号召少谈些政治，多谈些经济。这个批评对我们当时的报纸同样是极其中肯的。但列宁所要求少谈的政治，是指在革命胜利后“对于旧题目的政治鼓动，对于政治的空谈”，而不是指象我们今天所遇到的全国人民一致关切的美国侵略朝鲜并威胁我国安全的这样重大的问题。这种重大的问题是不能少谈的。
    现在，我们的报纸已经着手加强关于时事的报道和讨论，朝鲜人民的反侵略战争，中国人民抗美援朝的爱国运动，全世界人民保卫和平的斗争已不断成了报纸的重要主题。但在这方面也还有些报纸没有完全做好这个工作。他们对朝鲜战争不够重视。新华社关于朝鲜人民军反攻中重大胜利的报道以及当地人民反对美帝侵略的运动，都没有给予更大的重视。类似的缺点使我们的有些报纸不能完全满足人民对了解时事发展的迫切要求，不能充分反映全国人民抗美援朝的坚强的决心，我们的宣传落在实际的后面了。在今天的条件之下，我们的报纸应该注意那些对我国人民生活影响日益重大的时事的报道，应该扩大时事报道的篇幅，并把那些重大的惊心动魄的事件，用有力的方式刊登在重要的地位，作惊心动魄的宣传。小型的报纸并应该注意对新华社稿件通俗化的工作，以便在有限的篇幅中，能完整而有力地进行时事宣传。
    我们曾经反对地方报纸脱离地方实际工作，用大量篇幅来发表那些对地方生活没有实际影响的全国性和全世界性的新闻，主张地方报纸应该以反映地方人民生活为主的方针。但这不是说，连对地方生活有重大影响的事件也不加以报道和讨论。地方的工作和地方群众生活常常要受到全国和全世界形势的程度不同的影响。因此，即使在和平建设时期，地方报纸在执行地方化方针中，仍须经常用适当的力量报道和讨论有关的全国性和全世界性的新闻。而在今天的形势之下，地方报纸就应当负责告诉当地人民关于朝鲜问题的情况，使他们对于国家的前途充满注意和信心，加紧作好关系于国家利益的各项工作。有的地方报纸已开始这样做了，例如十月三十日的东北日报，就出现了题为《愤怒的煤铁之城》和《表表咱反对美帝的心》的两篇通讯，生动地报道了当地工人农民的爱国主义的实际行动；新华社也播出了《战斗的赵国有车间》这样有鼓动力量的通讯。这种用具体生动的群众行动作有力的政治鼓动的方式，每个报纸都应该学习。
    潜伏的反动分子正在制造谣言，对于时局真相不够明了的群众也有一些顾虑和疑问，对于这些现象置之不理是不应该的。报纸应该用有力的宣传，粉碎反动分子的谣言，解释群众的疑问。最近一个多礼拜以来，上海解放日报经常在信箱中回答读者有关时事的疑问，其中包括这样的问题：“美国侵略者的弱点及其受到的打击”，“美国是在走向法西斯化吗？美国比过去德日意的命运好些吗？”“我们埋头建设好了，何必去过问国际斗争？这个想法和看法对吗？”东北日报也在社会服务栏中解答了一些读者的疑问，如：“美帝国主义侵略朝鲜和侵略中国是不是一件事情？”“民主阵营比侵略阵营力量大，为啥在联合国是少数票？”此外，上海新闻日报和大公报曾组织过关于时事问题、战争与和平问题的读者讨论会。这样的工作都是有益的和值得取法的。
    随着美帝扩大侵略，全国人民抗美援朝运动的展开，关于时局的政治鼓动已成为报纸的严重任务。在过去一个时期中，各地报纸在制定计划使用人力方面多半着重经济建设的报道，现在这种情形必须有适当的改变，才能使报纸成为时事宣传的中心。
