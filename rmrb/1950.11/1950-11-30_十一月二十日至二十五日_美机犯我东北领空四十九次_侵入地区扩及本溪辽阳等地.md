　　From November 20th to 25th,
    US planes violated our Northeast airspace 49 times
    Invading areas expanded to Benxi, Liaoyang and other places
    [Xinhua News Agency, 29th] The aircraft of the United States, which is invading Korea, has expanded its aggressive actions to the Benxi City and Liaoyang County areas of Liaodong Province, within one hundred miles of our northeastern border.

    At 10:20 on the 24th of this month, two US aircraft invaded the Stone City and railway station east of Fengcheng County, Liaodong Province, Northeast China. After dropping four bombs, they invaded north along the railway line to Caohekou, Lianshanguan, Xiamatang and other places. At 10:48, they invaded the airspace above Benxi City, circling and侦察 for several weeks. They then invaded the airspace above Niuxintai and Liaoyang County to偵察, and then flew back to Korea via Benxi, Fengcheng, and Andong and other places. The provocative actions of the US Air Force invading North Korea in invading our country's airspace are expanding wantonly.

    In the six days from the 20th to the 25th of this month, US planes violated our Northeast airspace. According to incomplete statistics, there were 49 violations, with a total of more than 214 aircraft dispatched. The US aircraft's aggressive actions against our Northeast airspace included 14 strafing and bombing actions, including 9 bombings of Jiangqiao in Andong, Ji'an, and Changdianhekou. Its侦察 activities covered vast areas such as Benxi, Liaoyang, Ji'an, Linjiang, Yanji, Changbai, Fusong, Helong, Huanren, Kuandian and Andong City. In these six days, two of our compatriots were killed and four were injured due to strafing by US planes, and the property losses of residents were very heavy.

    The following is the process by which US planes bombed and strafed peaceful residents within the borders of Northeast China in these six days, causing injury and loss to the lives and property of our compatriots:

    At 12:45 on the 21st, 13 US planes invaded Andong City. After bombing Jiangqiao in turn at 12:49, two of them flew low to偵察 over Zhenjiangshan in Andong Town, and several others strafed fishing boats on the surface of the Yalu River and houses along the river in the Wenzigou area along the river within our country. Qi Wenshen, a 60-year-old fisherman, was shot and killed, and a fishing boat and part of the houses along the river were damaged.

    At 7:12 on the 22nd, four US planes invaded Andong and bombed Jiangqiao, and circled and strafed Yanwo Street in the city. Two of them flew over Aihe District and strafed near the water source and Pearl Street, and the other two flew to Linjiang Street, Xinhua Street, Zhen'an Road and other places to strafe, and chased our train to Caijiagou, and then strafed Jiudaogou and Gushishan area. Li Huimin, a farmer from Jiudaocun, Yuanbao District, was shot and killed when he passed Jiudaogou.

    At 9:47 on the 22nd, two US planes bombed the Gucheng Village Elementary School in Helong County, Jilin Province, dropping two bombs; at 10:03, they dropped five more bombs on the elementary school and nearby.
