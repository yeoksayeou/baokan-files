The General Administration of Customs Issues Interim Measures for Handling Customs Review of Tariff Classification and Valuation Appeal Cases

Since liberation, the handling of appeal cases related to tariff classification and valuation by customs offices in various regions has been inconsistent. The General Administration of Customs of the Central People's Government has formulated the "Interim Measures for Handling Customs Review of Tariff Classification and Valuation Appeal Cases," which has been approved and implemented by the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government. The full text of the measures is as follows:

I. These measures are formulated to implement the tariff policy of the Central People's Government, ensure the correct execution of tariff classification and valuation by the customs, and strive for reasonable burdens on taxpayers.

II. If the consignee (sender) or agent has objections to the tariff classification and valuation made by the customs, they may, within fourteen days from the day after the customs issues the tax payment certificate, submit a written appeal to the customs in triplicate in the format prescribed by the customs. Any appeal not submitted in accordance with the prescribed procedures will not be accepted.

III. After receiving the above-mentioned appeal, the customs shall re-examine and handle the case within seven days. If it agrees with the grounds for the appeal, the customs director may change the original decision.

IV. If the customs director does not agree with the grounds for the appeal mentioned in the preceding article, or agrees with some of the grounds and has changed the original decision but the appellant is still not satisfied, the handling process and opinions shall be submitted to the General Administration of Customs for review within fourteen days after receiving the original appeal.

V. After receiving the appeal forwarded by the customs, the General Administration of Customs shall review and make a decision within twenty days, unless there are special circumstances.

VI. In order to investigate and handle the appeal cases mentioned in the preceding article, the General Administration of Customs may notify the appellant to come to the office to defend themselves, or invite experienced experts to attend and assist.

VII. Before a decision is made on the appeal case, upon application by the consignee (sender) or their agent, the customs may allow them to pay a security deposit to take delivery of the goods first. The security deposit must be sufficient to cover the full amount of the tax payable and other additional charges assessed by the customs.

VIII. The late payment fee due to the appeal shall be levied or reduced/exempted by the local customs or the General Administration of Customs depending on whether the appeal is justified or whether the reasons are sufficient.

　　海关总署发布海关审理税则
    分类估价申诉案件暂行办法
    解放以来，各地海关处理有关税则分类及估价问题的申诉案件颇不一致。兹经中央人民政府海关总署订定“海关审理税则分类估价申诉案件暂行办法”，业经中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会批准施行。办法全文如下：
    一、为贯彻中央人民政府关税政策，保证海关执行税则分类及估价之正确，力求纳税人员担之合理，特制定本办法。
    二、受（发）货人或代理人对于海关所为税则分类和估价有异议时，得自海关填发税款缴纳证的次日起十四天内，依海关规定格式填具申诉书一式三份向关提出申诉，凡未依规定程序提出者，概不受理。
    三、海关接到上项申诉书后，应于七日内将该案重行审查处理，如同意其申诉理由，得由关长变更其原决定。
    四、海关关长不同意前项申诉理由者，或同意一部分理由已变更原决定而申诉人仍不服者，应将处理经过及意见于接到原申诉书后十四天内，呈请海关总署审理。
    五、海关总署接到海关呈转之申诉书后，除有特别情形者外，应于二十天内予以审理决定。
    六、海关总署为调查处理前项申诉案件，得通知申诉人到署申辩，或约请富有经验专家出席协助。
    七、在申诉案件未决定前，经受（发）货人或其代理人的申请，海关得准其缴纳保证金将货物先行提取，该项保证金须足敷应纳税款的全数和海关所核定的其他加征款项。
    八、因申诉而滞纳税款，其滞纳金应由当地海关或海关总署以申诉之有无理由，或理由是否充足，决定征收或减免。
