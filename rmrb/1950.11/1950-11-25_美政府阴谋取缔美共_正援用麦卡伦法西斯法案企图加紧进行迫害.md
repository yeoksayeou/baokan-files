Xinhua News Agency, November 24th: The Truman government is intensifying its efforts to outlaw the Communist Party. Since the U.S. Congress passed the McCarran Fascist Act in September, stipulating that the Communist Party and other progressive groups should be registered as illegal organizations, Truman issued an order on October 23rd establishing a five-member committee specifically responsible for implementing this act and carrying out the sinister activities of attempting to "dismantle the Communist Party and imprison its leaders for life," as described by the United Press. As the first step in this committee's activities, and in coordination with the U.S. Supreme Court's scheduled trial of the eleven leaders of the American Communist Party on December 4th, U.S. Attorney General McGrath submitted a 5,000-word fabricated document to the above-mentioned committee on the 22nd of this month. He demanded that the committee invoke the McCarran Act's clauses to order the American Communist Party to register as an agent of the so-called "Russian and world communist movement." The aim is to punish the American Communist Party, if it refuses to register, according to the act's provisions, which stipulate a maximum penalty of five years imprisonment and a fine of $10,000 for each day of delay.

　　美政府阴谋取缔美共
    正援用麦卡伦法西斯法案企图加紧进行迫害
    【新华社二十四日讯】杜鲁门政府正加紧从事取缔共产党的阴谋活动。自从美国国会于九月间通过麦卡伦法西斯法案，规定共产党及其他进步团体作为非法组织进行登记以后，杜鲁门即于十月二十三日下令成立一个五人委员会，专门负责执行这一法案，进行如合众社所称的企图“瓦解共产党并使其领袖终身系于囹圄”的罪恶活动。作为这个委员会开始活动的第一步，并配合美国最高法院定于十二月四日起对美共十一位领袖的上诉审判，美国司法部长麦格拉斯已于本月二十二日向上述委员会提出长达五千字的伪造文件，要求委员会援用麦卡伦法案条款，勒令美国共产党作为所谓“俄国和世界共产主义运动代理人”进行登记，准备在美共拒不登记时，即按该法案所定迟延一日即判处最高达五年的徒刑和一万美元罚金的条款处罚。
