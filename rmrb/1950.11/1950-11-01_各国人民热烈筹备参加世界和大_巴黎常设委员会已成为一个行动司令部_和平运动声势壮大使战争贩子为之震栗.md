Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, October 28th: The "Pravda" published Zhukov's Paris correspondence, reporting on the work of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress in preparing for the Second World Peace Congress. Zhukov wrote: The Standing Committee, tirelessly working in the National Intellectuals Union Building in Paris (a building with a beautiful symbolic name, the Palace of Thought), has increasingly resembled a command headquarters in recent days. Telegrams reporting on the progress of the congress's preparations are arriving here from all over the world in a constant stream. The delegations from various countries gathering in Sheffield, England, on November 13th—a city of the working class, where remnants of fascist bombings still remain—will be the most representative delegations ever to attend an international conference. Even in capitalist countries, despite the authorities' brutal terror, people are conducting large-scale preparations for the congress. National peace conferences in countries such as the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, India, Burma, Vietnam, Brazil, Chile, and Venezuela have specifically discussed the preparations for the World Peace Congress. Hungary, Italy, Switzerland, Austria, and many other countries will also hold such conferences soon. Thirty-one provinces in France have already elected delegates to attend the Second World Congress. The congress in other provinces is scheduled for October 28th. Before leaving the country for England, the French delegates will hold a national conference to formulate a common program in line with the hopes and will of the broad masses. In this regard, it should be recalled that 14 million people in France have voted in favor of banning atomic weapons.

The Australian delegation has been formed, headed by Mr. Street, the former Australian government representative to the United Nations. The Canadian delegation, led by theologian Wen Youzhang, who attended the First World Congress, is now ready to depart. In the United States, despite open acts of terror, preparations for the congress are still underway. 2.5 million Americans have signed the Stockholm Appeal demanding a ban on atomic weapons, thereby demonstrating their support for the mandate given to their representatives. In Japan, despite police terror, the Japanese people have collected 3.5 million signatures and elected a delegation to attend the World Peace Congress. The All-German Peace Congress, to be held in Berlin in early November, will elect the German delegation to attend the World Congress.

Zhukov continued: In the process of preparing for the World Peace Congress, the American warmongers' ridiculous theory that the world peace movement is a communist propaganda conspiracy has finally gone bankrupt. The inventors of this theory indiscriminately regard hundreds of millions of people as communists, thereby putting themselves in the most foolish position. As the peace movement is rising and strengthening, and groups with the most different intentions and tendencies are disguising themselves under the banner of peace, peace advocates see it as their task to expose and isolate a small group of political speculators who attempt to exploit the sentiments of peace-loving people.

Zhukov further pointed out: In September, France held two important conferences, which even the most capable American propagandists cannot call communist gatherings. These two conferences were the conference of the Mutual Aid Society, a secret society with considerable influence among bourgeois groups, and the conference of the so-called "Human Rights League," which has recently expressed hostility towards the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries more than once. However, it is very noteworthy that both groups deemed it necessary to adopt special resolutions defending peace and opposing preparations for a new war.

Zhukov continued: One can cite hundreds of examples to prove that the growing popular will to defend peace has forced even groups that are far from the progressive camp to demand a peaceful resolution of international disputes and oppose the American aggressors' preparations for a new world war. The peace fighters have done tremendous work, making every effort to act jointly with those who are truly fighting for peace. At the grand gathering of nations to be held on November 13th, thousands of representatives from all over the world will gather. This conference is a powerful factor proving the growing strength of the peace movement, which makes the warmongers tremble.

　　各国人民热烈筹备参加世界和大
    巴黎常设委员会已成为一个行动司令部
    和平运动声势壮大使战争贩子为之震栗
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科二十八日电：真理报发表朱可夫的巴黎通讯，报道世界保卫和平大会常设委员会筹备第二届世界保卫和平大会的工作。朱可夫写道：在巴黎全国知识分子联合会大厦（这个大厦有着一个优美的象征性的名字，即思想之宫）不屈不挠地工作着的常设委员会，这些天以来越发象一个行动司令部了。报告大会筹备工作情况的电讯从全世界各地川流不息地到达这里。十一月十三日在设菲尔德——英国的工人阶级城市，那里仍然有着法西斯轰炸的残迹——集会的各国代表团，将是向来出席国际性大会的最具有代表性的代表团。即使在各资本主义国家里，尽管有着当局残暴的恐怖行动，人民仍正在大规模地进行着大会的筹备工作。英国、荷兰、印度、缅甸、越南、巴西、智利、委内瑞拉等国全国性的和平会议，专门讨论了世界保卫和平大会的筹备事宜。匈牙利、意大利、瑞士、奥地利以及其他许多国家最近也要举行这种会议。法国已有三十一个省选举出出席第二届世界和大的代表。其他各省的大会订于十月二十八日举行。法国的代表们在离国赴英之前，将举行全国会议，制定符合广大群众的希望与意志的共同纲领。在这一方面，应该追述一下，法国已有一千四百万人民投票拥护禁止原子武器。
    澳大利亚代表团业已组成，团长是澳政府前驻联合国代表斯崔特。加拿大代表团由曾出席第一届世界和大的宗教家文幼章率领，该代表团现已整装待发。在美国，尽管有着公开的恐怖行为，大会的筹备工作仍在进行中。二百五十万美国人民已在要求禁止原子武器的斯德哥尔摩宣言上签了名，从而也就表明了拥护给予他们的代表的委托书。在日本，虽然有着警察的恐怖行为，但日本人民已征集了三百五十万签名，并选举了出席世界拥护和平大会的代表团。十一月初在柏林举行的全德和平大会，将选出德国出席世界和大的代表团。
    朱可夫继称：在世界保卫和平大会的筹备过程中，美国战争贩子硬说世界和平运动是共产党的宣传阴谋的可笑理论终于破产了。这种理论的发明者不分青红皂白地把亿万的人民都视为共产党人，从而使他们自己处于最愚蠢的地位。由于和平运动正在高涨与增强，某些意图与倾向最不同的集团正在争取和平的口号下把自己掩饰起来，在这种情形下，和平拥护者认为揭露与孤立企图利用爱好和平的人民的情绪的一小撮政治投机家就是他们的任务。
    朱可夫进而指出：九月间法国举行了两次重要的大会，美国的宣传家们即使再有本事，也不能把它们称为共产党的集会。这两次大会便是在资产阶级集团中具有相当影响的秘密结社互助团的大会，及最近不止一次地表示过对苏联及人民民主国家持敌视态度的所谓“人权联盟”的大会。但是，两个团体却都认为有必要通过保卫和平、反对新战争准备的特别决议，这一点倒是很特出的。
    朱可夫继称：人们可以引证成百的例子，证明日益增长的人民保卫和平的意志已迫使甚至远非进步阵营的团体，也来要求和平解决国际争端，并反对美国侵略者准备新的世界战争了。和平战士们作了巨大的工作，尽一切努力与那些真心为和平而奋斗的人们共同行动。在十一月十三日举行的各国的盛大集会上，将有全世界各国的数千代表聚首，这次大会是一个强有力的因素，证明使战争贩子为之震栗的和平运动的日益壮大。
