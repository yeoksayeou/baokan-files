　　Xinhua News Agency, New York, November 4th: The United Nations General Assembly held a plenary session on the morning of November 3rd and completed its consideration of the item on the agenda entitled "United Action for Peace."
    Canadian representative Pearson once again presented the usual arguments in favor of the "Seven-Nation Proposal" and defended US representative Dulles—the notorious warmonger—refuting Vyshinsky's criticism of Dulles. After Pearson's speech, the Assembly immediately voted on the various proposals that had been submitted.
    First put to a vote were the draft "Seven-Nation Proposal" and the amendments proposed by the Soviet delegation to that draft. As previously reported, the purpose of these amendments was to eliminate the illegal provisions in the Seven-Nation Proposal that conflicted with the United Nations Charter, such as the provision on establishing so-called United Nations forces within the national armies of United Nations member states that would act upon the recommendations of the United Nations General Assembly. The amendments proposed by the Soviet delegation also stipulated adding to the "Seven-Nation" proposal a requirement that, in accordance with the United Nations Charter, any issue to be dealt with should be submitted by the General Assembly to the Security Council before or after discussion. Another amendment proposed by the Soviet delegation stipulated removing from the "Seven-Nation" proposal the words referring to the illegally established Interim Committee (i.e., the illegal "Little Assembly") and the decision violating the Charter to convene a special session of the United Nations General Assembly based on the decision of any seven members of the Security Council; and deleting other illegal provisions violating the Charter.
    The Soviet amendments were rejected by the majority vote of the US-British bloc. The delegations of the Soviet Union, Ukraine, Byelorussia, Poland, and Czechoslovakia voted in favor of all the Soviet amendments. The delegations of three to seven countries abstained from voting on these amendments each time. They always included delegations from several Arab countries.
    The Assembly then voted on the various sections of the Seven-Nation Proposal and the entire proposal, and passed them. The preamble to the proposal was adopted by a vote of fifty-three to five (the Soviet Union, Ukraine, Byelorussia, Poland, and Czechoslovakia opposing). Section A of the Seven-Nation Proposal, which stipulated that a special session of the United Nations General Assembly could be convened based on the decision of any seven members of the Security Council or the majority of United Nations member states, was adopted by a vote of fifty-two to five with one abstention (Yemen).
    Section B of the proposal, which stipulated the establishment of a Peace Observation Corps, was adopted by a vote of fifty-seven (with two abstentions—Saudi Arabia and Afghanistan). The delegations of the Soviet Union, Ukraine, Byelorussia, Poland, and Czechoslovakia voted in favor of this section. Section C of the proposal, which recommended the establishment of armies to serve the United Nations, was adopted by a vote of forty-five to five (the Soviet Union, Ukraine, Byelorussia, Poland, and Czechoslovakia) with seven abstentions (India, Indonesia, Yemen, Syria, and others).
    Section D, concerning the establishment of a Collective Action Committee, was adopted by a vote of forty-five to five with three abstentions. Section E of the proposal, which called on all United Nations member states to fully comply with joint measures and cooperate more actively with the United Nations, was unanimously accepted. The entire Seven-Nation Proposal was adopted with fifty-two votes in favor. Five votes against (the Soviet Union, Ukraine, Byelorussia, Poland, and Czechoslovakia), two abstentions (India and Argentina), and Lebanon did not participate in the voting.
    Next, another proposal was voted on, which recommended that the Security Council take the necessary steps to ensure that, in the event of any threat to peace, action can be taken as stipulated in the Charter to resolve disputes peacefully, and to formulate measures to quickly apply the provisions of the Charter regarding the deployment of United Nations member states’ armies under the Security Council's command.
    As is well known, this proposal was originally put forward by the Soviet delegation. When the Political Committee considered this proposal, amendments were put forward under pressure from the US-British bloc. The amendment stated that the provisions of this proposal "should not prevent the General Assembly from performing the 'functions' stipulated in the Seven-Nation Proposal."
    This proposal was adopted by a vote of fifty-two in favor and six abstentions. Due to the aforementioned amendment, the delegations of the Soviet Union, Ukraine, Byelorussia, Poland, and Czechoslovakia abstained.
    The Assembly then voted on a proposal submitted by Syria and Iraq. The proposal suggested that the permanent members of the Security Council meet to discuss all issues that "could threaten international peace and paralyze the work of the United Nations," "in order to resolve major differences and reach agreement in the spirit and letter of the Charter."
    First, a vote was taken on an amendment proposed by the Soviet Union to list all permanent members of the Security Council (including the People's Republic of China) that the General Assembly recommended for consultation. This amendment was rejected by a vote of forty against, eight in favor (the Soviet Union, Ukraine, Byelorussia, Poland, Czechoslovakia, India, etc.), and nine abstentions (Yemen, Afghanistan, Egypt, etc.). The entire proposal was adopted unanimously.
    Finally, the proposal submitted by the Soviet delegation was put to a vote. This proposal was to recommend that the General Assembly suggest that the five permanent members of the Security Council take steps to ensure the implementation of Article 106 of the Charter, which stipulates that permanent members hold consultations and stipulate that they consult together for the purpose of taking joint action deemed necessary on behalf of the United Nations in maintaining peace and security.
    This proposal was rejected, with thirty-nine votes against, five in favor, and eleven abstentions (Yemen, Indonesia, Iraq, Egypt, etc.).
    The meeting then adopted three reports from the Administrative and Budgetary Committee on the financial situation of the United Nations organization.
    The meeting then began to discuss the item on the agenda, "The issue of Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania's compliance with human rights and fundamental freedoms."
    This issue was proposed by the Australian delegation to be included in the agenda of the General Assembly and was supported by other delegations of the US-British bloc. The Soviet delegation firmly opposed including this issue in the agenda of the Fifth Session of the General Assembly because the purpose of those proposing to discuss this issue was to undermine the reputation of the people's democratic countries and to interfere in the internal affairs of three sovereign states—Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania. This issue was discussed for four days in the meetings of the Special Political Committee. At the meeting, the proposal submitted by the Australian delegation was adopted, with the delegations of five countries (the Soviet Union, Ukraine, Byelorussia, Poland, and Czechoslovakia) voting against the Australian proposal and the delegations of thirteen countries abstaining.
    At the morning meeting on November 3rd, after Lopez (representative of the Philippines) reported on the discussions and results of the Special Political Committee meeting on this issue, the Australian representative Officer made a speech elaborating on his proposal. His speech was limited to general slanderous condemnations, saying that human rights and fundamental freedoms were not observed in Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania. He urged the Assembly to accept the proposal submitted by his delegation.
    US representative Cohen then spoke. He also supported the slanderous condemnations of the three countries and repeated the fabricated allegations, which had been exposed, about Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania violating human rights and fundamental freedoms. The US delegation could not present concrete facts and had to resort to unfounded words, maliciously distorting the nature of the democratic system in the people's democratic countries. He also urged the Assembly to support the proposal of the Australian delegation.
    After the US representative spoke, the meeting adjourned.

　　联大全体会议在美英集团操纵下
    通过违反宪章的七国提案
    苏联提出各项修正案竟全被否决
    【新华社讯】塔斯社纽约四日电：联合国大会于十一月三日上午举行全体会议，将列入议程名为“保障和平的联合行动”案的问题审议完毕。
    加拿大代表皮尔逊又一次地提出赞成“七国提案”的例行论据，并为美国代表杜勒斯——臭名远扬的战争贩子——辩护反驳维辛斯基对杜勒斯的批评。在皮尔逊发表演说后，大会即对已提出的各项提案举行表决。
    首先提付表决的是“七国提案”草案和苏联代表团对该草案提出的修正案。如前所报道，这些修正案的目的是取消七国提案草案中与联合国宪章抵触的非法规定，例如关于在联合国会员国的国家军队中建立依据联合国大会的建议而行动的所谓联合国军队的规定。苏联代表团提出的修正案并规定在“七国”提案中添进这样的要求：按照联合国宪章，任何待处理的问题在讨论以前或以后，应由大会提交安全理事会。苏联代表团提出的另一个修正案规定从“七国”提案中删去提到非法建立的临时委员会（按即非法的“小型联大”）的词句及关于违反宪章而规定依据安全理事会任何七个理事国的决定即可召开联合国大会特别会议的决定；并删去其他违犯宪章的非法规定。
    苏联的各项修正案被美英集团的多数票所否决。苏联、乌克兰、白俄罗斯、波兰及捷克斯洛伐克的代表团投票赞成所有的苏联修正案。三至七国代表团在表决这些修正案时每次都弃权。他们之中总是包括几个阿拉伯国家的代表团。
    大会随后表决七国提案的各节及整个提案，并予以通过，提案的序言以五十三票对五票（苏联、乌克兰、白俄罗斯、波兰及捷克斯洛伐克反对）获得通过。七国提案中规定根据安全理事会的任何七个理事国或大多数联合国会员国支持的决定即可召开联合国大会特别会议的甲段，以五十二票对五票和一票弃权（也门）获得通过。
    提案中规定设立和平观察团的乙段，以五十七票（两票弃权——沙特阿拉伯和阿富汗）获得通过。苏联、乌克兰、白俄罗斯、波兰及捷克斯洛伐克代表团投票赞成这一段。提案中建议建立军队为联合国服务的丙段，以四十五票对五票（苏联、乌克兰、白俄罗斯、波兰及捷克斯洛伐克）和七票弃权（印度、印尼、也门、叙利亚及其他）获得通过。
    关于成立集体行动委员会的丁段，以四十五票对五票及三票弃权获得通过。提案中呼吁一切联合国会员国完全遵守联合措施，并且更积极地与联合国合作的戊段被一致接受。整个七国提案以五十二票赞成而通过。五票反对（苏联、乌克兰、白俄罗斯、波兰及捷克斯洛伐克），两票弃权（印度和阿根廷），黎巴嫩未参加投票。
    接着投票表决另一提案，该提案建议安理会采取必要的步骤以保证在宣布和平受到任何威胁时能采取宪章所规定的行动，使争端得到和平解决，并制订措施以迅速应用宪章中关于联合国会员国将军队交安理会调度的规定。
    如所周知，这个提案最初是苏联代表团提出的。当政治委员会审议这个提案时，在美英集团的压力之下曾有修正案提出来。该修正案说，这个提案的规定“不应使大会不能履行七国提案”中所规定的“职能”。
    这个提案以五十二票赞成及六票弃权获得通过，由于上述修正案，苏联、乌克兰、白俄罗斯、波兰及捷克斯洛伐克的代表团弃权。
    大会随后表决叙利亚与伊拉克所提的提案。该提案建议安理会常任理事国开会讨论一切“可以威胁国际和平与瘫痪联合国工作”的问题，“以便按照宪章的精神与文字解决主要的分歧意见并达成协议。”
    首先表决苏联所提关于列举大会建议进行协商的安全理事会所有常任理事国（其中包括中华人民共和国）的修正案。这项修正案以四十票反对，八票赞成（苏联、乌克兰、白俄罗斯、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、印度等国）及九票弃权（也门、阿富汗及埃及等国），遭到否决。整个提案获得一致通过。
    最后付诸表决的是苏联代表团所提出的提案，这个提案要大会建议安全理事会五常任理事国采取步骤，保证履行宪章第一百零六条，该条规定常任理事国举行磋商，并且规定它们一道磋商为的是代表联合国采取在维持和平与安全上证明为必要的联合行动。
    这项提案遭到否决，三十九票反对，五票赞成和十一票弃权（也门、印尼、伊拉克、埃及等国）。
    会议然后通过了行政及预算委员会关于联合国组织的财政情况的三个报告。
    会议于是开始讨论议程中所列的“保加利亚、匈牙利与罗马尼亚三国遵守人权与基本自由问题”这一议案。
    这个问题由澳大利亚代表团提议列入大会议程，而受到美英集团其他国家代表团的支持。苏联代表国坚决反对把这一问题列入大会第五届会议的议程，因为提议讨论这个问题的人们，其目的是要破坏人民民主国家的名誉，以及干涉三个主权国家——保加利亚、匈牙利与罗马尼亚——的内政。这个问题在特别政治委员会的会议中讨论了四天。在会议上澳大利亚代表团所提出的提案获得通过，当时五国代表团（苏联、乌克兰、白俄罗斯、波兰与捷克斯洛伐克）投票反对奥大利亚提案，十三国代表团弃权。
    十一月三日的上午会议上，在罗培兹（菲律宾代表）报告了特别政治委员会会议讨论这一议案的经过与结果后，澳大利亚的代表奥菲瑟即发表演说阐释他的提案。他的演说只限于泛泛的诽谤性的谴责，说什么人权与基本自由在保加利亚、匈牙利与罗马尼亚未被遵守。他敦促大会接受他的代表团所提的提案。
    美国代表柯亨继起发言。他也支持对三国的诽谤性的谴责，并且重述已被揭露的关于保、匈、罗侵犯人权与基本自由的捏造。美国代表团不能提出具体事实，就只好说了一通毫无根据的话，恶意曲解人民民主国家的民主制度的性质。他也敦促大会支持澳大利亚代表团的提案。
    美国代表发言后，会议遂即休会。
