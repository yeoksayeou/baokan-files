　　In Memory of Comrade Bishi
    Fu Zhong
    Comrade Bishi's unfortunate passing! This mournful news weighs heavily on my heart, I am utterly shocked and deeply saddened.
    Comrade Bishi, you were my close comrade and my excellent mentor. Recalling our meetings, whether at home or abroad, the encouragement and guidance you gave me were as high as the clouds and as deep as the sea!
    At the time of the Red Second and Fourth Front Armies' convergence, it was due to your arrival that the political haze, ideological confusion, and organizational chaos created by the traitor Zhang Guotao within the Red Fourth Front Army were gradually clarified. Each time you kindly spent long nights talking with me, I wholeheartedly and joyfully grasped your spirit. Your kind and sincere attitude educated me and tens of thousands of comrades, uniting us around the Central Committee headed by Chairman Mao. This is something I will never forget!
    During the War of Resistance Against Japan, I deeply experienced your indomitable will, your highly flexible tactics, and your seriousness and steadfastness in principles. You resolutely opposed the tendencies of compromise and surrender both inside and outside the Party at the time, and struggled to implement Chairman Mao's correct political line, enabling me to further learn how to work. This is also something I will never forget!
    Comrade Bishi! Though your breath has ceased, your great spirit will forever live in my memory!
    Comrade Bishi! Rest in peace. I vow to follow your legacy, learn from your example, and continue to learn and advance diligently!

　　怀念弼时同志
    傅钟
    弼时同志不幸病逝了！这哀音如巨石般地紧压在我的心头，我万分地惊愕，深沉地悲痛。
    弼时同志，你是我亲密的同志，你是我良好的导师。回忆我们每次聚晤时，无论在国内国外，你给予我的鼓舞和教导，有如青云之高，海水之深！
    在红二、四方面军会合时，由于你的到来，才将叛徒张国焘在红四方面军党内所造成政治上的阴霾，思想上的糊涂，组织上的混乱加以逐步地澄清。你每次亲切地和我在一起作长夜谈，都使我衷心愉快地领会你的精神。你那种和蔼诚挚的态度教育了我并教育了成千上万的同志，团结在以毛主席为首的中央来。这是我永志不忘的！
    在抗日战争中，我又深切地体验到你的不屈不挠的意志，在策略上的高度灵活性，原则上的严肃性和坚定性。你坚决地反对当时党内外的妥协投降倾向，为贯彻毛主席的正确的政治路线而斗争，使我进一步地学习做工作。这也是我永志不忘的！
    弼时同志！你的呼吸虽然停止了，但你的伟大精神是永远活在我的记忆中！
    弼时同志！你安息吧，我誓将遵照你的遗志，学习你的榜样，兢兢业业地继续学习，继续前进！
