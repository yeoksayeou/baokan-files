　　The First Step for Actors in Creating a Character
    Jin Shan
    The Youth Art Theater accepted the task given by the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League and is staging "How Steel Was Tempered." The theater's review committee assigned me to play the character of Pavel Korchagin. I immediately read the novel "How Steel Was Tempered." After reading the novel twice, I felt distressed because I didn't know where to start. I had sleepless nights, searching for the starting point for creating this role; later, I found it, and I decided on my approach. I made the following remarks at the first script study meeting:

    "Before reading this novel and script, I thought: I haven't acted in six or seven years. I am an actor who was once recognized by the audience; now that I'm back on stage, wouldn't it be 'disgraceful' if I failed? Therefore, I was very worried. But after making a preliminary study of this novel and script, I was ashamed to criticize my own 'individualism' tendency; I was deeply moved by the excellent proletarian qualities and the noble communist party member archetype. In the depths of my heart, I severely attacked the petty-bourgeois vulgar and erroneous consciousness hidden within me. Then I thought about how we should perform this play well. I thought about the serious motives and profound intentions of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League in deciding to stage this play. At that moment, I had indeed forgotten my personal success or failure and was concerned about the success or failure of the entire play and all the characters in it.

    "When I compared Pavel Korchagin with myself, I truly lost confidence in playing this role because I felt incredibly ashamed. I should frankly say that I am not worried about the so-called physical appearance of being fat or thin, tall or short, or some performance skills on the stage. I am somewhat confident in overcoming these difficulties because I have lived on the stage for many years. What I am most worried about is how I will express the fire-like heat that never goes out, the spirit of moving forward without ever bowing one's head, and the world's greatest sincerity—the sincerity of serving the working people. These are priceless treasures in the world, and it is very difficult for an actor with insufficient cultivation like me to grasp them. Because of this, I have to first reflect on myself: If I want to play Pavel well, I must get close to Pavel. The prerequisite for getting close to Pavel is to thoroughly analyze myself, criticize myself, and correct the mistakes I have made. In other words, if I can play Pavel well, it means that I have shown progress in this work. What are the specific facts of showing progress? It means that my leadership style, working methods, attitude towards life and learning in the group have all improved. Otherwise, fundamentally speaking, it is difficult for me to complete this task.

    "I believe that the play 'How Steel Was Tempered' takes Pavel's fighting behavior and his growth in battle as the main thread. Therefore, the performance of this play will succeed because of the character of Pavel and fail because of the character of Pavel. The success or failure is at stake, and the responsibility is heavy. However, all the characters in the play (whether they are negative or positive) also have their different degrees of importance. The authenticity of the inner emotions of each character in the play will directly affect the expression of Pavel's character. Therefore, all the actors in the play should have the same strong sense of responsibility as I do. Our only goal is how to successfully complete the performance task of 'How Steel Was Tempered'.

    "We must not forget that we are members of the Youth Art Theater of the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League. Our actions will affect youth art workers across the country. Therefore, I propose that everyone participating in this play also reflect on themselves. We must sincerely approach Pavel, learn from Pavel, and thus play Pavel well in the process of strictly criticizing ourselves. I would also like to say one more sentence: Let us strive to transform ourselves in the work of performing 'How Steel Was Tempered' - so that party members become better party members, league members become better league members, and non-party league members actively strive to become party members or league members - this is the best way to perform 'How Steel Was Tempered'."

    Since I had decided on my approach, and this approach was also agreed upon by everyone, it was as if the ship had a rudder, and I began to sail forward. My first step was to do the work of collecting materials. I studied the History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the History of the Soviet Civil War, the Concise History of the Soviet Union, the Collected Works of Ostrovsky (some of the original texts I could not understand, so I asked someone to translate them for me). I also listened to a report by the famous Soviet director Gerasimov about Pavel Korchagin, a report by the Soviet expert Markov on the History of the Soviet Civil War, and a report by Mei Yi, the translator of the novel "How Steel Was Tempered." These materials helped me understand the historical background and surrounding environment of Ostrovsky at that time. I once wrote in an article introducing Pavel Korchagin: "He was in the most acute era of the life-and-death struggle between two classes. The success or failure of this struggle was related to the fate of mankind all over the world. Therefore, the broad masses of Soviet working people, under the leadership of Lenin and his party, fought heroically with all their hearts and minds for the victory of this struggle. They all understood the responsibilities they bore, and they all believed that they were competent. Therefore, they were full of interest in any new things. In common life, common work, and common struggle, they had completely forgotten the word "self". Their minds were full of "revolution". They fearlessly pursued the truth and grasped the truth. Pavel Korchagin was one of them. Pavel Korchagin grew up among them."

    In addition, I collected some heroic patriotic stories of Chinese Communist Party members fighting against the enemy to understand the internationalist spirit of the proletarian revolution.

    While studying these materials, I also participated in several large and small collective discussion meetings to exchange experiences. Then, I temporarily put aside these reference materials, and I started to do a comparative study of the novel and the script. The novel is a thick volume, and the script is only a thin volume. How the adapter summarizes the essence of the original work in the script, how to condense a long chapter into a short dialogue, and how to concentrate several young characters in one character to express it, all of these require a lot of research and thought. In order to deepen the content of the characters' brief dialogues, we must find the basis of the original work in each scene and enrich the content (subtext) in each line. I believe that only by doing this can the meaning have depth and the emotion have concentration.

    But this approach is only limited to the scope of understanding. Understanding alone cannot solve the problem of character creation. As I said before, I must further get close to this character; to get close to such a character with noble proletarian revolutionary qualities, to understand such a character with a high degree of Bolshevik party spirit, is not an easy task. What I said at the first rehearsal meeting must be put into practice here. I first compared the characters in the novel, the characters in the play, and myself to see how far apart they were? It would have been better if I hadn't compared them, but after comparing them, I felt that I was too far behind.

    In the process of trying to get close to Pavel, I was both happy and painful. I was happy that when I improved some of my work style, I was happy to see that I had made progress. What was painful was that getting rid of a shortcoming was not as easy as shelling a peanut; you must know that the disease grows on my body, and the root of the disease is in my skin. It is conceivable how painful it is to dig out the rot in the skin! I came from a petty-bourgeois background, and although I have participated in revolutionary work for some years, I have not worked hard enough in the past, so today, if I am required to be a typical proletarian revolutionary fighter, I am still far behind; but Pavel? It is precisely the above-mentioned typical. Now, if I want to get close to him, I must wage a resolute and merciless struggle against my own incorrect consciousness at all times. Since I already have an "enemy" (incorrect consciousness) on my body, I only have two paths: one is to be eliminated by the "enemy", and the other is to resolutely, thoroughly, and cleanly eliminate the "enemy".

    For several months, I have been in a mental battle, and it has been difficult for me to sleep and eat; in order to complete the task assigned to me by the organization (to play Pavel Korchagin well), and in order to improve my actor's artistic work, I have indeed devoted my greatest energy. If I were to examine the results of my efforts in the past few months now, I should say that I have made considerable achievements.

    But this is only to say that the work of "understanding" and "getting close" has yielded some results. Can this little achievement solve the problem of character creation completely? Naturally, it cannot. If it is said that we can complete the performance task of a revolutionary character on the stage simply by "understanding" and "getting close", then we might as well ask the political commissar in the army to come to the stage to play the political commissar, and the mayor in the government to play the mayor on the stage. In this way, there would be no need for the existence of "actors" in the world. The reason why an actor becomes an actor is because he (she) has a unique expression skill. This skill is developed through long-term stage work. In terms of his (her) physical functions, he (she) can control freely and do whatever he wants; in terms of his (her) political and cultural literacy, he (she) has a certain cultural level, and a correct, that is, revolutionary, outlook on life, and practical revolutionary struggle experience. He (she) can see the profundity of life, and thus promote the bright and brilliant aspects of life, and curse the dark and ugly aspects of life. These things must be accurately, exquisitely, deeply, and completely expressed on the stage through his (her) own vivid image. Therefore, when I understand Pavel and further try to gradually get close to Pavel (that is, after doing the first step of character creation), I have to further solve the problem of how to express Pavel. I would like to report on this issue in another short article "The Actor's Method of Expression", and then ask comrades for advice.

　　演员创造人物的第一步
    金山
    青年艺术剧院接受了团中央给予的任务，排演《钢铁是怎样炼成的》。剧院的评审委员会派我扮演保尔·柯察金这个人物，我立刻阅读小说《钢铁是怎样炼成的》。我读过两遍小说之后，就感到苦闷，因为我一时不知如何下手是好。我曾整夜失眠，寻找创作这角色的起点；后来，我找到了，我决定了我的做法，我就在第一次的剧本研究会上发表了如下的谈话：
    “我在未看这小说这剧本时，我曾这样想过：我已六七年未演戏了，我是一个曾被观众所承认的演员；如今我重上舞台，一旦演失败了，岂不‘英名扫地’？因此，我就非常担忧。但当我将这小说和剧本，作了初步研究之后，我就很惭愧地批判了自己的‘个人主义’倾向；我被那优良的无产阶级品质，高贵的共产党员典型深深感动；在我的内心深处，严厉地攻击了我暗藏着的小资产阶级的庸俗的错误意识。从而我就想到我们应该怎样把这戏演好。我想到团中央决定上演这戏的严肃的动机和深刻的用意。就在这个时候，我确已忘掉我个人的成败问题，而关心着整个戏，整个戏中人的成败问题了。
    “当我将保尔·柯察金和我个人作一比较的时候，我确因感到无比的惭愧而丧失了扮演这角色的信心。我应该坦白地说：我并不耽心外形的所谓肥瘦高矮以及舞台上的一些属于表演技巧上的困难问题，这些困难的克服，我还有几分把握，这是由于我多年来生活于舞台之故。我最耽心的是我将如何表现这永不熄灭的火一样的热力，永不低头的向前的精神，和那世界上最大的真诚——服务于劳动人民的真诚。这些，乃是世界上无价之宝，在我，这样一个修养不足的演员，是很不容易掌握住的。由于此，我不得不先对自己作一个反省：我要演好保尔，就必需接近保尔，要接近保尔的先决条件，就是彻底分析自己，批判自己，改正自己所犯的错误。换句话说，如果我能演好保尔，那就说明我在这次工作中表现了进步；表现进步的具体事实是什么呢？就是我在团体中的领导作风，工作方法，生活与学习的态度，都有了改进。要不然，从基本上说，我是很难完成这任务的。
    “我认为《钢铁是怎样炼成的》这剧，是以保尔的战斗行为及其在战斗中成长为主线的。因此，这剧的演出，将因保尔这人物的成而成，也将因保尔这人物的败而败，成败所系，责任重大。但全剧中人（不论是反面人物或正面人物）也都有其不同分量的重要性，剧中每一个人物的内在感情的真实性，必将直接影响到保尔性格的表现。所以，剧中全体演员，都应和我有同样重大的责任感。我们的目的只有一个，就是如何胜利地完成这《钢铁是怎样炼成的》的演出任务。
    “我们不要忘了，我们是中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会的青年艺术剧院的一员，我们的所作所为，必将影响及于全国的青年艺术工作者。因此，我提议我们每个参加此剧的人，也都来反省一下自己，我们要在严格批判自己的过程中，真心诚意地去接近保尔，学习保尔，从而演好保尔。我还要说一句：让我们在演出《钢铁是怎样炼成的》的工作中，努力改造自己——使党员成为更好的党员，团员成为更好的团员，非党团员，积极争取成为党员或团员——这就是演好《钢铁是怎样炼成的》的最好的方法。”
    我既经决定了我的做法，这做法也得到了大家伙儿的同意，就好比船有了舵，我就开始向前航行。我第一个步骤是做搜集材料的工作，我研究联共党史，苏联国内战争史，苏联简史，奥斯特洛夫斯基文集（有些原文的我看不懂，请人翻译给我听），我又听了苏联名导演格拉西莫夫关于保尔·柯察金的报告，听了苏联专家马尔可夫关于苏联国内战争史的报告，听了《钢铁是怎样炼成的》小说译者梅益的报告，这些资料，帮助我对奥斯特洛夫斯基当时的时代背景和周围坏境的认识。我曾在一篇介绍保尔·柯察金的文章中，这样写着：“他是处在两个阶级作生死斗争最尖锐的时代，这个斗争的成败，关系着全世界人类的命运，所以苏联的广大劳动人民，在列宁和他的党领导下，全心全意为着这个斗争的胜利而英勇奋斗；他们都明了自己所负的责任，而且他们都相信着自己能够胜任，所以他们对任何新鲜事物都充满兴趣；他们在共同生活，共同工作，共同斗争中，已经完全忘记了“自己”两个字，他们满脑子都是“革命”，他们毫不惧怕地追求着真理，并且掌握了真理。保尔·柯察金，就是他们中间的一个。保尔·柯察金，就是在他们中间成长起来的。”
    此外，我搜集了些中国共产党员向敌人作斗争的英勇爱国故事，借以体会无产阶级革命的国际主义精神。
    我在研究这些资料的同时，又参加了几次大型小型的集体讨论会，互相交换心得。随后，我就将这些参考资料暂搁一旁，我着手做小说与剧本对照的研究工作。小说是很厚的一册，剧本只薄薄一本，改编者如何将原著菁华集诸剧本，如何将洋洋一大章，精缩在一场短短的对话之中，又如何将几个青年人物，集中在某一个人物表现出来，这都是颇费研究和思考的。为求剧中人简短对话之内容的深度，我们必需在每场戏中找出它原著的根据，在每句台词中充实其内容（潜台词）。我以为只有这样做才能使语意有深度，感情有浓度。
    但这种做法，还只是局限于理解的范畴，单凭理解，并不能解决人物创造的问题。正如前文讲过了的，我必需进一步去接近这个人物；要接近这样一种具有高贵的无产阶级革命品质的人物，要体会这样一个具有高度的布尔什维克党性的人物，是一件很不容易的事。我在第一次排演会议上说过的话，就要在这里实行起来。我先把小说中人，剧中人和我自己比较比较，看看距离有多远？不比到也罢了，一比之下，觉得自己太差了。
    我在努力接近保尔的过程中，又高兴又痛苦，高兴的是当我改善了一些工作作风时，自欣有了进步。痛苦的是改掉一个毛病，并不如花生去壳那样容易；要知道病生在我身上，病根就在我的肌肤之中，要挖去肤中之腐，其痛也可知！我是小资产阶级出身，参加革命工作虽也有些年月，但因过去对学习不够努力，所以今天若以一个无产阶级革命战士的典型来要求我，还差得很远；然而保尔呢？却正是上述的典型。如今我要接近他，就必得随时随刻和自己的不正确的意识作坚决的无情的斗争。我的身上，既已有了“敌人”（不正确的意识），我就只有两条路，一条路是被“敌人”消灭，另一条路就是坚决彻底干净的消灭“敌人”。
    几个月来，我是心神交战，寝食难安；为了完成组织给我的任务（演好保尔·柯察金），为了使我的演员艺术工作能提高一步，我的确付出了我最大的精力。如果，现在让我检查一下这几个月努力的结果的话，我应该说，我是有了相当成绩的。
    但这只是说，“理解”与“接近”的工作，收到一点成果而已。单凭这点成果，难道就能全部解决了人物创造的问题吗？自然是不能的。假如说，我们在舞台上表现一个革命人物，单凭“理解”与“接近”，就能完成其表演任务的话，那么干脆就请部队中的政委来到舞台上演政委，政府里的市长，来演舞台上的市长，如此这般，世界上就不需要“演员”的存在了。演员之所以成为演员，是因他（她）具有一种独特的表现技能，这种技能，是经过长期的舞台工作的锻炼，就其肌体官能而言，他（她）能自如控制，从心所欲；就其政治与文化素养而言，他（她）有一定的文化水平，与正确的即革命的人生观，实际的革命斗争经验，他（她）能窥见人生之深奥，从而宣扬人生中光明灿烂，诅咒人生中黑暗丑恶。这些事象，又必需通过了他（她）自身的活生生的形象而将它准确、精到、深刻、圆浑地表现在舞台之上。因此，当我在理解了保尔，进一步努力渐渐接近保尔的时候（也就是，做了创造人物的第一步工作之后），我还要更进一步解决如何表现保尔的问题，这一问题，我愿意从另一短文《演员的表现方法》中报告出来，再请同志们指教。
