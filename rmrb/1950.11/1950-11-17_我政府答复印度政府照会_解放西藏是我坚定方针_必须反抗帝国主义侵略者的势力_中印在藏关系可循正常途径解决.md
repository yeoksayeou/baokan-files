　　Xinhua News Agency, 16th: The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China's reply to the note from the Government of the Republic of India regarding the Tibet issue:

　　On November 1, 1950, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China received a note from Ambassador Panikkar from the Government of the Republic of India regarding the Tibet issue.

　　In its previous exchanges with the Government of the Republic of India regarding the Tibet issue, the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China has repeatedly stated that Tibet is an indivisible part of Chinese territory and that the Tibet issue is entirely a domestic affair of China. The Chinese People's Liberation Army must enter Tibet, liberate the Tibetan people, and defend the Chinese border. This is the firm policy of the Chinese government. In accordance with the provisions of the Common Program adopted by the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the Chinese government recognizes that regional autonomy for minority nationalities within China is autonomy within the scope of Chinese sovereignty. The Indian government acknowledged this in its memorandum to the Chinese government on August 26 of this year. However, when the Chinese government truly exercises its national sovereignty and begins to liberate the Tibetan people, expel foreign forces and influence, to ensure that the Tibetan people are free from aggression and realize regional autonomy and freedom of religious belief, the Indian government attempts to influence and prevent the Chinese government from exercising its national sovereignty over Tibet, which cannot but greatly surprise the Chinese government.

　　The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China sincerely hopes that the Chinese People's Liberation Army can peacefully enter Tibet and undertake the sacred task of liberating the Tibetan people and defending the Chinese border. Therefore, it has long welcomed the Tibetan local delegation stranded in India to come to Beijing as soon as possible for peaceful negotiations. However, the delegation has consistently been obstructed by obvious external forces and has been slow to arrive. Moreover, the Tibetan local authorities have used the delay in negotiations to deploy heavy troops in Changdu, Xikang Province, in the Chinese mainland, attempting to prevent the Chinese People's Liberation Army from liberating Tibet. On August 31 of this year, my Ministry of Foreign Affairs, through Ambassador Panikkar, notified the Indian government that the Chinese People's Liberation Army would begin operations in western Xikang according to plan and hoped that the Indian government would assist the Tibetan local delegation to arrive in Beijing before mid-September to begin peaceful negotiations. In early and mid-September, my Chargé d'Affaires Shen Jian and Ambassador Yuan Zhongxian successively notified the delegation in person that they must arrive in Beijing by September, otherwise, the delegation should bear all responsibility and consequences for the delay. In mid-October, my Ambassador Yuan again notified the Indian government of this matter. However, the Tibetan local delegation, under the instigation of external forces, continued to make various excuses and was slow to leave India. Although the Chinese government has not abandoned its desire for a peaceful solution to the Tibet issue, the Chinese People's Liberation Army cannot further delay its planned advance, and the liberation of Changdu has further confirmed that foreign forces and influence are obstructing the peaceful resolution of the Tibet issue through the obstruction of the Tibetan army. However, regardless of whether the Tibetan local authorities are willing to conduct peaceful negotiations or what the outcome of the negotiations may be, any foreign interference is not allowed, and the People's Liberation Army's entry into Tibet to liberate the Tibetan people is a settled matter.

　　In order to show its friendliness to the Government of the Republic of India and to understand the Indian government's desire to see a peaceful resolution to the Tibet issue, the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China has kept the Indian government informed of the efforts our government has made in this regard. However, the Chinese government must consider it a great regret that the Indian government, disregarding the facts, considers the internal affair of the Chinese government exercising its sovereignty over its territory of Tibet as an international dispute that will inevitably exacerbate the world's regrettable tensions.

　　The Government of the Republic of India has repeatedly expressed its desire to develop Sino-Indian friendship on the basis of mutual respect for territorial sovereignty, equality, and mutual benefit, and to prevent the world from moving towards war. The entry of the Chinese People's Liberation Army into Tibet is precisely to safeguard the integrity of China's territorial sovereignty. All countries willing to respect China's territorial sovereignty should first express their true attitude towards China on this issue. At the same time, we believe that what is currently threatening the independence of all countries and world peace is precisely the forces of those imperialist aggressors. In order to safeguard national independence and defend world peace, we must resist the forces of these imperialist aggressors. The entry of the Chinese People's Liberation Army into Tibet is a major step in maintaining China's independence, preventing imperialist aggressors from dragging the world into war, and defending world peace.

　　The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China welcomes the Indian government's renewed statement that it has no political or territorial ambitions towards China's Tibet and does not seek new privileged status. As long as both sides strictly abide by the principles of mutual respect for territorial sovereignty, equality, and mutual benefit, we believe that the friendship between China and India should develop normally, and Sino-Indian diplomatic, commercial, and cultural relations in Tibet can also be appropriately and mutually beneficially resolved through normal diplomatic channels.

### 我政府答复印度政府照会  解放西藏是我坚定方针  必须反抗帝国主义侵略者的势力  中印在藏关系可循正常途径解决

　　我政府答复印度政府照会
    解放西藏是我坚定方针
    必须反抗帝国主义侵略者的势力  中印在藏关系可循正常途径解决
    【新华社十六日讯】中华人民共和国中央人民政府对印度共和国政府关于西藏问题的照会的答复：
    一九五零年十一月一日，中华人民共和国外交部收到潘尼迦大使阁下交来印度共和国政府关于西藏问题的照会一件。
    中华人民共和国中央人民政府在其于印度共和国政府关于西藏问题的历次来往文件中，曾屡次申明：西藏是中国领土不可分的一部分，西藏问题完全是中国的一个内政问题。中国人民解放军必须进入西藏，解放西藏人民，保卫中国边疆，这是中国政府的坚定方针。中国政府根据中国人民政治协商会议所通过的共同纲领的规定，认承中国境内少数民族的区域自治，是在中国主权范围之内的自治。关于这一点，印度政府在其本年八月二十六日致中国政府的备忘录中曾经承认过。但当着中国政府真正行使其国家主权，开始解放西藏人民，驱逐外国势力和影响，以保证西藏民族得以免除侵略，实现区域自治和信教自由的时候，印度政府却企图影响和阻止中国政府对于西藏的国家主权的行使，这不能不使中国政府十分惊异。
    中华人民共和国中央人民政府诚恳地希望中国人民解放军能和平地进入西藏，担负起解放西藏人民、保卫中国边疆的神圣任务，因此，很早就欢迎滞留在印度的西藏地方代表团尽快地前来北京，进行和平谈判。但该代表团始终是受着明显的外力阻挠，迟不前来。并且西藏地方当局还利用拖延谈判的时机，在中国内地西康省的昌都布置重兵，企图阻拦中国人民解放军去解放西藏。本年八月三十一日，我外交部经由潘尼迦大使曾通知印度政府，中国人民解放军即将在西康西部按照预定计划开始行动，希望印度政府协助西藏地方代表团能于九月中旬以前到达北京，开始和平谈判。九月上中旬，我申健代办，袁仲贤大使曾先后当面通知该代表团务于九月内赶到北京，否则，该代表团应负一切延宕的责任和后果。十月中，我袁大使又将此事通知印度政府。可是，西藏地方代表团依然由于外界的唆使，制造各种借口，迟不离印。中国政府虽然仍未放弃和平解决西藏问题的愿望，但中国人民解放军却不能一再推迟其预定的进军计划，而昌都的解放，更证实了外国的势力和影响是在经过西藏军队阻挠着西藏问题的和平解决。可是无论西藏地方当局愿否进行和平谈判，及谈判结果如何，任何外国的干涉都是不容许的，人民解放军的进入西藏，解放西藏人民也是定了的。
    中华人民共和国中央人民政府为表示对于印度共和国政府友好起见，并谅解印度政府愿意见到西藏问题和平解决，曾将我政府在这一方面所做的努力随时通知印度政府，但是中国政府不得不认为极大遗憾的是印度政府竟不顾事实，将中国政府对其领土西藏行使主权的内政问题认为是势将助长世界上可悲的紧张局势的国际纠纷。
    印度共和国政府曾屡次表示它在互相尊重领土主权与平等、互利的基础上发展中印友谊，并制止世界走向战争的愿望。中国人民解放军的进入西藏正是为了保障中国领土主权的完整。一切愿意尊重中国领土主权的国家，首先应该在这一个问题上表示出他们对于中国真正的态度。同时，我们认为目前威胁着各国独立与世界和平的正是那些帝国主义侵略者的势力。为了维护国家独立和保卫世界和平，就必须反抗这些帝国主义侵略者的势力。中国人民解放军的进入西藏，正是维护中国独立、制止帝国主义侵略者将世界拖向战争、保卫世界和平的一个重大步骤。
    中华人民共和国中央人民政府欢迎印度政府又一次声明它对中国的西藏并无政治的或领土的野心，亦不求取新的特权地位。只要彼此严格遵守互相尊重领土主权及平等、互利的原则，我们相信，中印两国的友谊应该得到正常的发展，中印在西藏的外交、商业和文化关系，也可以循着正常的外交途径获得适当的互利的解决。
    一九五零年十一月十六日于北京
