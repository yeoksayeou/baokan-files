　　The Second World Peace Congress, so eagerly awaited by the people of the world, has victoriously opened in Warsaw, Poland, after thwarting the sabotage plots of the imperialists by moving its venue from Sheffield, England. This fully demonstrates that the power of the world's people to defend peace is strong and invincible; all the shameless plots of the US-British imperialist war bloc to undermine peace cannot escape their tragic fate of failure.
　　The British government's despicable slander against the Congress, its conspiracy to persecute representatives attending the Second World Peace Congress, its refusal to issue visas to representatives from various countries, and its attempts to obstruct the convening of the Congress in Sheffield, all of this once again demonstrates the heinous nature of the US-British imperialist war group's extreme hatred of peace and its frantic pursuit of war, and further reveals the fear of those warmongers of the judgment of human justice.
　　The representatives attending this Congress are not only backed by more than 500 million peace signatories of the Stockholm Appeal, but also by the peace-loving people of the seventy-three countries they represent. They want to accuse the US-British imperialists of pursuing a sinister policy of instigating another world war; they demand that effective steps be taken to extinguish the flames of aggressive war that imperialism has already ignited everywhere; they demand strict prohibition of atomic weapons and a ban on the clamor for aggressive war; they demand universal arms reduction and the implementation of the Soviet Union's program for peaceful struggle put forward at the UN General Assembly; they demand the continued consolidation and expansion of the people's front of all countries fighting for peace, and active assistance to the people of all countries in their struggle against aggression. All of this is the unanimous and pressing demand of the people of the world, and it is also a major issue that this Congress urgently needs to resolve.
　　Our people wrote their hopes and demands for the Second World Peace Congress on peace letters of entrustment and handed them to our delegation attending the Congress. The demands of our people are completely consistent with the demands of peace-loving people around the world. Our 475 million people and millions of armed soldiers have undergone a long and bloody struggle. Our goal is to achieve national liberation, eliminate imperialist aggression, and build a peaceful and happy life; in a word, it is for peace and democracy. However, now the American aggressors have not only expanded their aggression against our neighbor Korea, but also directly carried out aggression against our country, seriously threatening our security and undermining our people's peaceful construction. This is something that our people will never tolerate.
　　World peace is indivisible, and defending peace is inseparable from opposing aggression. This is an irrefutable truth proven by the personal experience of our people. The American aggressors' aggression against Korea and China is part of their plan for aggression against the whole world. Therefore, peace-loving people all over the world need to unite more closely to jointly oppose the aggressive crimes of the imperialist bloc headed by the United States and jointly defend peace.
　　The number of our people who have signed the Stockholm Appeal passed by the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress has reached more than 220 million. We not only firmly oppose the use of atomic weapons, but also demand that the government that first uses atomic weapons be declared a war criminal and punished. Now that the American aggressors are using atomic bombs to threaten the people of the world, the people of the world have every reason to give the American aggressors a final warning: if it dares to defy the world, then the people of the world will not only respond to bombs with bombs, but also for the war criminals who first use atomic weapons, no matter where they run to, we will swear to pursue them and bring them to justice, and we will never forgive them.
　　Our people love peaceful life and yearn to continue to engage in domestic economic and cultural construction. For this purpose, we have already made great efforts and strived for a fundamental improvement in the country's financial and economic situation. However, our people are unwilling to eke out a living under the knives of the aggressors. Now that the invading armies of the United States and its accomplice countries have trampled on our neighbor Korea, occupied our territory of Taiwan, and repeatedly violated our territorial waters and airspace, bombing our cities and villages, and killing and wounding our fathers, elders, brothers and sisters, our people have every right and obligation to assist the people of Korea and resist American aggression through their own voluntary actions. This kind of voluntary action is completely just, has historical precedent, and cannot be interfered with by anyone. We believe that all righteous people in the world cannot ignore the American aggression against the Korean people and should provide the Korean people with just assistance in various ways. Because this is an integral part of the struggle to defend world peace. Our people's voluntary action to aid Korea and our proposed plan for a peaceful solution to the Korean issue are not only not contradictory, but are completely consistent. We firmly advocate that all foreign troops withdraw from Korea so that the Korean people can solve their own internal affairs.
　　However, the American imperialist warmongers have not shown the slightest indication of a peaceful solution to the Korean issue or a cessation of its aggressive war. On the contrary, the likes of MacArthur and Matthews are still frantically directing an increasingly large-scale war of aggression, and Acheson is constantly fabricating excuses for imperialist expansion of aggression and "preemptive" wars at the UN General Assembly. More than 76 percent of this year's American budget is used for military spending to continue expanding the war, and Truman has also asked the US Congress to increase military spending by 15 billion US dollars; British military spending has also increased by more than 40 percent. The US-British group is stepping up its heinous plan to arm West German and Japanese fascists in both the West and the East. The danger of another world war instigated by US-British imperialism is increasingly threatening the people of the world. Therefore, the people of the world are facing an important juncture. All peace-loving countries and peoples must be highly vigilant, resolutely unite, and repel all new challenges from imperialism. We demand that this Congress more severely condemn the crimes of imperialist warmongers such as MacArthur, Matthews, and Acheson, resolutely implement the resolution on stopping aggression adopted at the meeting of the Executive Committee of the World Peace Congress in Prague on August 18 this year, and support the Soviet Union's program for peaceful struggle put forward at the recent UN General Assembly.
　　We are fully convinced that the strength of the world peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union led by the great Stalin is strong and invincible, and the people of the world have never been so strong and powerful as they are today. The war plans of the declining imperialist aggressor bloc can be smashed. History will never repeat itself. The American aggressors are trying to follow the old path of German, Japanese, and Italian fascism, but they will not only not go that far, but will suffer an even more tragic failure.
　　In the great struggle to eliminate imperialist aggressive war, all peace-loving people are our friends, including the people of the United States. The United States we oppose is the United States of Wall Street tycoons and warmongers, the United States ruled and enslaved by the likes of Truman, Acheson, Marshall, MacArthur, Matthews, and Dulles. This United States is not only the mortal enemy of the people of other countries in the world, but also the mortal enemy of the American people. Therefore, it should be said without reservation that the United States imperialism, the chief culprit of world aggression, is the common enemy of the whole world.
　　We, the Chinese people, are willing to contribute everything to the cause of lasting world peace and people's democracy under the glorious banner of the World Peace Congress. We believe that the demands and goals of the defenders of peace are so just, the ranks of the defenders of peace are so strong and invincible, and the cause of peace will surely triumph.

### 和平的力量是无敌的——祝第二届世界保卫和平大会

　　和平的力量是无敌的  ——祝第二届世界保卫和平大会
    全世界人民所渴望的第二届世界保卫和平大会，粉碎了帝国主义者的破坏阴谋，把开会的地点从英国的设菲尔德移到波兰的华沙，胜利地开幕了。这充分地证明了世界人民保卫和平的力量是强大无敌的；美英帝国主义战争集团破坏和平的一切无耻阴谋都不能避免它悲惨失败的命运。
    英国政府那样卑劣地诬蔑和大，并阴谋迫害出席二届和大的代表，拒绝发给各国代表入境的签证，千方百计地阻挠大会在设菲尔德召开。这除了又一次表明美英帝国主义战争集团极端仇视和平、疯狂追求战争的罪恶本质以外，更显示了那一班战贩们对于人类正义的审判的恐惧。
    出席本届和大的代表，不但有在斯德哥尔摩宣言上签名的五万万以上的和平签名者为后盾，而且有他们所代表的七十三个国家全体爱好和平的人民为后盾。他们要控诉美英帝国主义者所奉行的挑起另一次世界大战的罪恶政策；他们要求采取有效的步骤熄灭帝国主义已经到处燃起的侵略战争的火焰；他们要求严格禁用原子武器，禁止侵略战争的叫嚣；他们要求普遍裁减军备，实现苏联在联合国大会上所提出的和平斗争纲领；他们要求继续巩固与扩大为和平而斗争的世界各国的人民阵线，并积极援助各国人民反侵略的斗争。这一切都是全世界人民一致的迫切要求，也是这一届大会所亟需解决的重大课题。
    我国人民把自己对于第二届世界保卫和平大会的希望和要求，写在和平委托书上，交付了我国出席大会的代表团。我国人民的要求与全世界爱好和平人民的要求是完全一致的。我国四万七千五百万人民和数百万武装将士们，曾经经过了长期流血的斗争，我们的目的，就是要实现民族解放，消灭帝国主义侵略，建设和平幸福的生活，一句话，就是为了和平民主。但是，现在美国侵略者不但扩大了对我们的邻国朝鲜的侵略，而且直接对我国实行侵略，严重威胁了我国的安全，破坏了我国人民的和平建设。这是我国人民所决不能容忍的。
    世界和平是不可分割的，保卫和平与反对侵略是不可分割的。这是我国人民切身经验所证明的颠扑不破的真理。美国侵略者对朝鲜和对我国的侵略，乃是它对全世界侵略计划的一部分。因此，全世界爱好和平的人民需要更紧密地团结起来，共同反对以美国为首的帝国主义集团的侵略罪行，共同保卫和平。
    在和大常委会所通过的斯德哥尔摩宣言上签名的我国人民，已达两亿二千余万人。我们不但坚决反对原子武器的使用，并且要求宣布首先使用原子武器的政府为战争罪犯而加以制裁。现在美国侵略者既以原子弹来恐吓世界人民，因此，世界人民完全有必要给予美国侵略者以最后的警告：如果它胆敢冒天下之大不韪，那末，世界人民不但要以炸弹来回答炸弹，而且对于首先使用原子武器的战争罪犯，不论它跑到天涯海角，誓将追拿归案法办，决不能予以宽贷。
    我国人民热爱和平生活，渴望能够继续从事于国内的经济与文化建设，并且为此目的，我们业已进行了重大的努力，争取了国家财政经济状况的基本好转。但是，我国人民决不愿在侵略者的刀口下苟且偷生。现在美国及其帮凶国家的侵略军队既已蹂躏了我们的邻邦朝鲜，侵占了我国的领土台湾，并且多次侵犯了我国的领海、领空，轰炸了我国的城镇和田庄，杀伤了我们的父老兄弟，我国人民就完全有权利和义务，用人民自己的志愿行动来援助朝鲜的人民，反抗美国的侵略。这种志愿的行动是完全正义的，是史有前例的，是任何人都不能干涉的。我们相信全世界正义的人民，对于朝鲜人民遭受美国的侵略都不能置之不理，都应该用各种各样的方法给予朝鲜人民以正义的援助。因为这是保卫世界和平的斗争中不可分割的一部分。我国人民志愿援朝的行动，和我们所主张的和平解决朝鲜问题的方案不但毫无矛盾，而且是完全一致的。我们坚决主张一切外国军队撤出朝鲜，使朝鲜的内政问题由朝鲜人民自己去解决。
    但是，美帝国主义战争贩子们至今还丝毫没有和平解决朝鲜问题、停止它的侵略战争的表示。相反的，麦克阿瑟、马休斯之流还在疯狂地指挥着规模日益扩大的侵略战争，艾奇逊还不断地在联合国大会上为帝国主义的扩大侵略和“先发制人”的战争制造口实。美国今年预算的百分之七十六以上是用于继续扩大战争的军费，杜鲁门还向美国国会要求增加一百五十亿美元的军备费用；英国的军费也增加了百分之四十以上。美英集团在西方和东方都正加紧进行武装西德和日本法西斯的罪恶计划。美英帝国主义所策动的另一次世界战争的危险正变本加厉地威胁着世界人民。因此，世界人民正面临着一个重要关键。一切爱好和平的国家和人民必须高度警惕起来，坚决团结起来，击退帝国主义的一切新的挑战。我们要求本届和大更加严厉谴责帝国主义战争贩子如麦克阿瑟、马休斯、艾奇逊之流的罪行，坚决实行和大执行局本年八月十八日布拉格会议关于制止侵略的决议，拥护苏联在最近联合国大会上所提出的和平斗争纲领。
    我们完全确信，以伟大斯大林领导的苏联为首的世界和平民主阵营的力量是强大无敌的，世界人民从来没有像今天这样强大有力。没落的帝国主义侵略集团的战争计划是可以被粉碎的。历史永远不会重演。美国侵略者企图走德、日、意法西斯的老路，但是他们不但不能走那样远，而且将遭受更悲惨的失败。
    在为消灭帝国主义侵略战争而进行的伟大斗争中，一切爱好和平的人民都是我们的朋友，包括美国的人民在内。我们所反对的美国，是华尔街巨头和战争贩子的美国，是杜鲁门、艾奇逊、马歇尔以及麦克阿瑟、马休斯、杜勒斯之流所统治与奴役的美国。这个美国不但是世界其他各国人民的死敌，也是美国人民的死敌。因此，应该毫无保留地说，世界侵略魁首美国帝国主义乃是全世界的公敌。
    我们中国人民愿意在世界和大的光辉旗帜下，为世界持久的和平与人民民主事业而贡献一切。我们相信，和平保卫者的要求和目的是这样的正义，和平保卫者的队伍是这样强大无敌，和平的事业就一定要胜利。
