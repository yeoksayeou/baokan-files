    Suffocated American Science

    In the process of social development, the progress of science has improved production technology. In the past, human society progressed from feudalism to capitalism, and science played its role. It is inherently revolutionary, constantly progressing, and constantly promoting social development. Today, because of the production technology developed and advanced by science, human society is being asked to take another step forward, and the relations of production should enter the socialist stage. However, true science is being suffocated in America today.

    After World War II, the United States fantasized about conquering the world and enslaving all mankind with atomic bombs. Therefore, they controlled the institutions and scientists that manufactured atomic bombs, thinking that this would maintain their exclusive ownership of atomic bombs.

    The "Federal Bureau of Investigation" (FBI) in the U.S. government is a special agency. Academic and research institutions related to atomic energy are all placed under the control of the "Federal Bureau of Investigation." Therefore, since the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) was established in January 1946, it has been directly controlled by the "Federal Bureau of Investigation." The Atomic Energy Act of 1946, passed that year, stated that "the Atomic Energy Commission shall not employ anyone before the 'quality,' 'relationship,' and 'loyalty' of that person have been clarified by the 'Federal Bureau of Investigation.'"

    What are the so-called "quality, relationship, and loyalty"? The following are some of the standards for "poor quality, relationship, and loyalty" revised by the "Federal Bureau of Investigation" in January 1949: (1) Having relationships with foreign agencies or having relatives living abroad; (2) Advocating revolution or belonging to "illegal groups" (in December 1949, federal high judges had issued ninety groups, including associations such as the American Association of Scientific Workers and the American Association of Arts, Sciences, and Professions, and more were added later), or sympathizing with or having connections with "illegal groups" or members; (3) Sympathizing with communism or other "illegal political consciousness," or sympathizing with the Communist Party or members of the Communist Party, or sympathizing with "illegal peripheral organizations" or members of such organizations; (4) Intentionally opposing war, except for religious consciousness.

    This control is not only for the Atomic Energy Commission, but also for government agencies, military agencies, and later even commercial laboratories and schools. In March 1947, Truman issued an order to check the "loyalty" of all government personnel, and at the same time strengthened the "Un-American Activities Committee" of the Lower House. As early as December 1942, military agencies had begun to dismiss personnel who were "disloyal." Such things have become more and more frequent after 1947. Those who are dismissed due to "disloyalty" cannot ask the agency to explain the reasons, nor do they go through trial or allow appeal. At the same time, when looking for another job, this history of dismissal due to "disloyalty" must also be reported by the original agency, so it is impossible to find a job in the government, factory, or school after being dismissed.

    Control of scientists in the name of checking "loyalty" and persecution of scientists in the name of "disloyalty" are being carried out in various universities in the United States. In the autumn of 1949, the board of directors of the University of California demanded that all employees sign a "loyalty oath." At that time, all the faculty associations, trade unions, and student unions of the school opposed it. The matter was deadlocked until April of this year. After mediation by the alumni association, the form of the oath was slightly changed. Many faculty and staff members, although unwilling to sign, had to succumb for fear of not being able to find a job after being dismissed. But finally, at the end of June, there were still more than a dozen professors who had not signed, and the school suspended them. In the past two years, schools have arbitrarily forced professors to leave their jobs. For example, Spitz, a biology professor at the University of Oregon, was fired by the school for introducing Lysenko's theory of genetics and could no longer find a job. Another example is Lorch, a mathematics professor at Pennsylvania State College, who was also fired by the school for transferring his housing to a black family.

    Introducing Soviet academics, as in the example above, is also considered "disloyal." Therefore, in October 1948, a magazine introducing Soviet medicine, "American Review of Soviet Medicine," was also forced to stop publishing. In its inaugural speech in 1943, biologist W.B. Cannon said, "We hope to increase mutual understanding between the two countries through this." When the Federal Supreme Judge announced ninety "illegal groups" in 1947, the American Soviet Medical Society, which published this publication, was also considered an "illegal group." In the last issue before being forced to stop publishing in 1948, the editor sadly stated that American academics would be suffocated by the power of politics. This year, three thousand copies of Scientific American were burned because they contained an article discussing atomic energy, for fear of leaking well-known "secrets."

    In the Second World War and the years that followed, the military gradually strengthened its control over scientific research. Before that, most universities and private research institutions were mostly subsidized by capitalists to engage in related research. For example, the powerful U.S. Steel Corporation conducted various experiments related to steel exploration, refining, and processing through universities and research institutes. Without subsidies from capitalists, it is difficult to imagine that these research institutions could survive. After the outbreak of World War II, the military's powers and funding greatly expanded, and it extended its reach to schools. For example, the Office of Naval Research, the Army Engineering Corps, and the Atomic Energy Commission established many experimental stations and experimental programs in various research institutes and universities. Many of the experiments are related to war, but many have nothing to do with combat. The military has its reasons for doing so. First, it felt that the research subsidized by capitalists was not closely related enough to war and military production, and not fast enough. Second, and most importantly, it was to make university scientific research indispensable to the military through this kind of economic assistance. In this way, when there is a need, all research can serve the war and the military in a timely manner. Third, this is an indirect persecution of scientific workers. Whoever does not listen to the military will face the crisis of unemployment or changing careers.

    Under this series of planned threats, enticements, and oppressions, the financial groups and warlords have led scientific research to war, and it is precisely because of this that true science is suffocated. Persecuted science, when it cannot serve the people, will inevitably decline or develop in a heretical direction. The fact that research on atomic energy is not as fast and good as the military expected is a concrete manifestation of the former, and those who willingly degenerate fall into heresy and evil. The best example of the latter is the currently popular psychoanalysis. This theory refuses to admit that the psychological development of people is affected by the environment, but traces the roots of all behaviors and thoughts back to childhood. It is as if a revolutionary's rebellious consciousness must be because he was whipped by his father a few more times when he was a child. This extremely idealistic psychoanalysis is currently spreading its influence through movies, school education, and newspaper propaganda in order to divert the direction of the general public's struggle.

    American genetics, shrouded in idealism, still adheres to Morgan's "factor theory" in order to maintain racial discrimination like Hitler's Germany. Geneticists have been persecuted by the rulers, as in the example above. No one dares to introduce the achievements of the Soviet Union in genetics. Even many of their own experimental results, such as many facts found in microbial genetic phenomena, can actually strongly prove Lysenko's theory, they still try to distort them with the "factor theory." If they are not unwilling, they dare not accept theories rejected by their rulers.

    The rampant idealism is also manifested in the revival of the debate between science and religion. It is well known that general secondary schools are not allowed to teach the theory of evolution due to religious pressure. But the current focus of the debate is no longer a simple ban on teaching, but whether science is subordinate to religion. Reactionary physicists, biologists, geologists, and astronomers all explain the universe, atoms, and life phenomena as mysterious and unknowable, and the God who dominates all these unknowables, this set of theories is being spread in a variety of new ways. In order to better anesthetize people, it always starts from the point of view of "science," and the things analyzed are also "scientific," but in the end, everything cannot escape the palm of God.

    Science is suffocated in the United States. What about scientific workers? Under tremendous pressure, some scientists, due to a lack of political awareness and a spirit of struggle, have to take a passive path, delving into books and nitpicking for pleasure, dissatisfied with the status quo, but daring to be angry but not daring to speak out, let alone do anything, and not knowing what to do. A few have become megaphones for the military and capitalists, desperately advocating atomic war and anti-Soviet and anti-communist. The reactionary atomic physicist Urly is a good example. There are not many who see things clearly at the moment. People like Einstein and the famous physical chemist Pauling have repeatedly called for peace and opposed atomic bombs. But their voices have been drowned out by the strong atmosphere of war preparations.

    Relatively enlightened scientific worker groups, such as the American Association of Scientific Workers, the Federation of American Scientists, and the Association of University Professors, have also expressed opposition on certain occasions, such as the unreasonable dismissal of scientific workers and the military's control of the Atomic Energy Commission. But these many groups still lack a mass base and are just loose gatherings of a few prestigious scientists.

    Moreover, they can at most only make appeals. As for how to mobilize the masses and strive for the real freedom of scientific research, they don't know how to do it.

    The road ahead for American scientific workers is very clear. Either strive for peace and oppose atomic bombs like Pauling, or be a fascist scholar, a helper and accomplice, there is no third way. Delving into trivialities and ignoring world affairs only facilitates the invaders. In the situation where the peace camp is growing stronger and the warmongers are at a loss, the majority of American scientific workers should and can awaken. What is important is to strive for the early arrival of awakening.

    窒息了的美国科学
    协和医学院  金荫昌  清华大学  涂光炽
    在社会发展的过程中，科学的进步改良了生产技术，过去人类社会从封建制度进展到资本主义制度，科学曾起着它的作用。它本身是革命的，是在不断的进步的，也不断推动了社会的发展。到了今天，因为科学发达而进步了的生产技术，正在要求人类社会再向前走一步，生产关系应该进入社会主义阶段了。可是，真正的科学今天在美国是被窒息了。
    第二次世界大战后，美国幻想着以原子弹来征服全世界，奴役全人类。因此他们控制着制造原子弹的机构和科学家，以为这样就可以保持着原子弹的专有。
    在美国政府机构里的“联邦侦查局”（Federal Bureau of Investigation简称FBI）就是一个特务机关。有关原子能的学术和研究机构都放在“联邦侦查局”统制之下。所以自美国原子能委员会（Atomic Energy Commission简称AEC）在一九四六年一月成立起就直接受到“联邦侦查局”的控制。当年通过的原子能法案（Atomic Energy Act of  1946），说明“在未经‘联邦侦查局’调查清楚某人的‘品质’，‘关系’和‘忠诚’以前，原子能委员会不得任用。”
    所谓的“品质，关系和忠诚”是些什么呢？下面是一九四九年一月“联邦侦查局”重订的一些“不良品质，关系和忠诚”的标准：（一）与外国机关有关系或有亲眷住在外国；（二）赞成革命，或属于“非法团体”（一九四九年十二月联邦高等法官曾经颁布过九十个团体，其中包括如美国科学工作者协会，美国艺术科学职业协会等，后来又陆续增加），或是同情或与“非法团体”或会员有联系的；（三）同情于共产主义或其他“非法政治意识”，或同情于共产党或党员，或同情于“非法外围组织”或该类组织会员；（四）除去宗教意识以外，故意反对战争的。
    这种控制并不单是对原子能委员会的，对于政府机关、军事机关、后来以至于商业性的实验室和学校里也是一样。一九四七年三月，杜鲁门发布了一个命令，检查所有的政府人员的“忠诚”，同时加强了下议院的“非美活动委员会”。远在一九四二年的十二月，军事机关已经开始对“不忠诚”的人员予以解雇，这样的事，在一九四七年后更是层出不穷了。由于“不忠诚”而解雇的人，不能要求机关解释理由，也不经过审判或允许上诉。同时在另找工作的时候，这一套因“不忠诚”而解雇的历史还要由原来的机关传报过去，因此被解雇之后就无法再在政府、工厂或学校找到工作。
    以检查“忠诚”为名对于科学家的控制，以“不忠诚”为名对于科学家的迫害，在美国的各个大学中都在进行。一九四九年秋季，加里福尼亚州大学的董事会提出要求，要全校的雇员签“忠诚誓书”，当时全校教授会，职工会，学生会全都反对。事情僵持到今年四月，经校友会的调停，把誓书的形式稍改了一点，许许多多的教职员虽不愿签，但是怕被解聘后找不到工作，不得不屈服了。但终于到六月底还有十几个教授没签，竟让学校停职了。在近两年学校竟任意迫令教授离职，例如奥勒冈（Oregon）大学生物学教授斯匹兹（Spitzer）因为介绍了李森科（Lysenko）的遗传学说被学校解聘之后都不能再找到工作。又如宾西文尼亚州立大学（Pensylvania State Collage）的数学教授洛奇（Lorch）因为把住房转让给一家黑人居住也被学校解聘了。
    介绍了苏联的学术，像上面所举的例子，也算是“不忠诚”，所以在一九四八年的十月，一种介绍苏联医学的杂志《苏联医学评介》（American Review of Soviet Medicine），也被迫停刊了。在它一九四三年的创刊辞里，生物学家坎农（W.B.Cannon），说“我们希望借此增进两国间相互的了解。”一九四七年联邦最高法官宣布九十个“非法团体”时，出版这种刊物的美苏医学会（American Soviet Medical Society）也被算是“非法团体”。一九四八年被迫停刊前的最后一期中，编辑人沉痛的说明美国学术将被政治的威力压得窒息了。今年的科学美国因载有一篇讨论原子能的文章，被烧了三千册，也就恐怕泄漏了尽人皆知的“秘密”。
    在二次世界大战及以后的几年中，军部逐渐加强了对科学研究的控制。在这之前，一般大学和私人研究机关，多半是由资本家津贴来从事有关的研究。譬如美国有势力的钢铁公司（U.S.Steel）就通过各大学和研究院，作各种有关钢铁的勘查，提炼和加工的试验。若没有了来自资本家的津贴，就很难设想这些研究机关能维持下去。二次大战爆发后，军部职权和经费大加扩充，便把魔手伸向学校。譬如海军研究所（Office of Naval Research），陆军兵工团（Army Engineeringcorps）和原子能委员会在各研究院和大学建立了许多试验站和试验计划。试验有许多是和战争有关联的，但也有很多和作战风马牛不相及。军部之所以这样做是有他的理由的。第一、他嫌由资本家津贴的研究和战争和军事生产关系还不够密切，还不够快。第二、主要的是通过了这种经济上的帮助而使大学的科学研究非依从军部不可，这样，当有着需要时，所有的研究便可以及时的为战争及军部服役。第三、这是对科学工作者的间接迫害，谁不听军部的话，谁便面临失业或改行的危机。
    在这种一系列有计划的威胁利诱和压迫下，财阀和军阀把科学研究引向了战争，也正因为这样，真正的科学是窒息了。被迫害了的科学，当它不能为人民服务时，必然一蹶不振，或则朝着异端发展。原子能的研究并不如军部预期的快和好，正是前者的具体表现，自甘堕落的便堕入异端邪说。说明后者最好的例子是目前盛极一时的心理分析学。这种学说拒绝承认人的心理发展是受环境影响的，而把一切行为，思想的根源追溯到幼童时代。好比一个革命家之有反抗意识必然是因为他小时候多挨了父亲几鞭子。这种极端唯心的心理分析目下正在借电影、学校教育、报纸宣传散播它的影响，以转移一般人民斗争的方向。
    为唯心论所笼罩着的美国遗传学，为了维护像希特勒德国一样的种族歧视，还坚持着摩根（Morgan）的“因子学说”。遗传学家们受了统治者们的迫害，像上面所举的例子，没有人敢再介绍苏联在遗传学里的成就，甚至有许多他们自己实验的结果，像在微生物遗传现象中所发现的许多事实，实际可以给李森科学说强力证明的，他们还设法用“因子学说”去曲解。他们如果不是不愿就是不敢去接受为他们统治者所拒绝的理论。
    唯心论的猖獗也表现在科学与宗教争论的复活上，由于宗教的压力一般中等学校不准讲授进化论，是世人皆知的事。但目前争论的中心已不是简单地禁止讲授的问题而是科学是否从属宗教的问题。反动的物理学家、生物学家、地质学家、天文学家把宇宙、原子和生命现象统统解释为神秘不可知的，而主宰着这一切不可知的便是上帝，这一套理论是在花样翻新的方式下被传播着。为着更好的麻醉人，它总是从“科学”的观点出发，分析的事物也是“科学”的，但末了一切都逃不出上帝的手掌。
    科学在美国是被窒息了，科学工作者呢？在巨大的压力下一些科学家由于缺乏政治认识和斗争意识，只好采取了消极的路，钻到书本和牛角尖里寻快乐，不满现状，但敢怒而不敢言，更不敢做，也不知该怎样做。少数的做了军人和资本家的应声虫，拚命的鼓吹原子战争，反苏反共。反动的原子物理学家由利（Urly）是一个好例子。比较看得清楚的目下还不多，像爱因斯坦和有名的物理化学家保林（L.Pauling）都曾多次的呼吁和平，反对原子弹。但他们的呼声是被浓厚的备战气氛淹没了。
    比较开明的科学工作者团体，像美国科学工作者协会，美国科学家联盟（Faderation of American Scientists），大学教授协会（Association of Universily Professors）也曾在某些场合，如对科学工作者的无理遭到解聘，和军部控制原子能委员会等事上，表示反对。但这许多团体还都非常缺乏群众基础，只是几个有威望的科学家的松散的集合。
    而且他们至多只能做到呼吁，至于如何发动群众，争取科学研究的真正自由，他们不知该如何做法。
    摆在美国科学工作者前面的路是再明显也没有了。要末像保林那样，争取和平，反对原子弹；要末做法西斯的学者，帮闲帮凶，没有第三条路。钻到牛角尖，不问世事只是便利了侵略者。在和平阵营日益强大，好战者捉襟见肘的狼狈情形下，多数的美国的科学工作者是应该也能够觉醒的。要紧的是要争取觉醒的早日到来。
