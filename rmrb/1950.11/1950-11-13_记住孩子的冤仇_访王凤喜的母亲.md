Remember the Hatred for Our Child
　　Ding Zi
　  — Visiting Wang Fengxi's Mother
    Wang Fengxi—a fourteen-year-old child, was shot dead by West, a U.S. soldier guarding the Xijiao Airport, in Nanwu Village, Xijiao, Beijing, at 11:00 a.m. on March 17, 1946. The Chinese people will never forget this blood debt!
    On the morning of November 9th, I went to Hengjie Village, Landianchang, Xijiao, to visit the unfortunate old lady—Wang Fengxi’s mother. The farmers in the village were busy picking Chinese cabbage on the ground, preparing to put the plump cabbages into cellars. Fengxi's mother and older brother were not at home. I waited until noon when Fengxi's younger sister, Xiuqin, and younger brother, Fengyun, returned from school. They took me to Nanwu Village—their aunt's house, and we found their mother who was grinding flour.
    I have never been good at comforting people, especially when facing a mother who has lost her beloved son. When I explained my purpose to her, her eyes immediately flashed with hatred. After a long silence, she slowly recounted the events of the unfortunate incident that happened four years ago:
    "It was the second month of the lunar calendar. My family had many mouths to feed and no way to make a living. I gave Fengxi and his crippled older brother 5,000 yuan in counterfeit currency to buy leftover mixed vegetables from the American soldiers near the airport. The good ones were for us to eat, and the bad ones for the pigs, which could sustain us for two days. That day, the person selling mixed vegetables hadn't arrived yet, and the two brothers were playing marbles on the main street of Nanwu Village. Suddenly, they heard the sound of gunfire from the airport. The crippled brother (i.e., Chaoshan) said, 'Fengxi! Let's go! The American soldiers are shooting!' Fengxi naively said, 'What's there to be afraid of shooting? They're not shooting at us!' Later, the crippled brother ran away, and Fengxi, picking up glass marbles on the ground, was shot six times by the damn American soldier, killing my Fengxi." At this point, she stopped speaking in pain, took a breath, and then continued:
    "They killed my son. I was heartbroken and angry. I died several deaths with heartache and anger. Half-crazed, I went to the local police (i.e., the local puppet police) to reason with them. I wanted them to compensate for my unjustly killed son. But the Kuomintang never sided with the common people. I went to the American mansion (i.e., the former U.S. Embassy in Beiping) several times for a hearing. They made me sit outside while they chattered inside, and I couldn't understand a word. They asked me how much money I wanted. I said I wanted him to pay with his life, not money. They said Americans don't believe in paying with their lives. I was really furious. If I had a knife at that time, I would have killed them all. Then I would compensate for them, but damn it, I couldn't even get into the house.
    "The murderer wore a white thread around his neck, and that was considered his punishment. Foreigners have money and power and can kill Chinese people at will. The Kuomintang didn't dare to manage them, wouldn't let me speak, and drove me back. Later, they gave me a little money to settle the matter. What could we common people do? Not wanting the money was useless; anyway, it was an unreasonable era."
    She paused, swept the remaining flour on the millstone, put it in the sieve, and started sifting again, saying:
    "Comrade! You haven't seen what a good child my Fengxi was! That's right! You saw my youngest son, right? Fengxi looked just like him, even better."
    I quickly looked for little Fengyun, but he had run out to play at some point. I remembered his little appearance, his round face, bright eyes, looking very clever and lively, revealing a strong will in his childishness. She continued:
    "When my Fengxi was studying at school, every teacher loved him. He studied extremely well. On the day of his 'Jie San' (i.e., the ceremony to 'liberate the soul' on the third day after death), several teachers cried. Alas! His father died early, and I alone brought up their four brothers, barely managing to provide him with some schooling. Was that easy? You say, a fourteen-year-old child, killed for no reason, and they said my child went to steal their things. American soldiers are simply beasts. I wish I could bite them a couple of times to relieve my hatred.
    "Now I completely understand who truly stands up for the common people. The Kuomintang built a blockhouse on my two mu of land, preventing production for more than three years. They lived in my house, ate my two laying hens. I begged them to spare those two, but they still wanted to eat them, harming me all day long, making my life miserable. Fortunately, they were driven away by the People's Liberation Army the year before last. The People's Liberation Army lived in my house, sweeping the yard every day, calling me 'Grandma' when they came in and out, and always saying they were disturbing me. Before liberation, those bastards spread rumors saying 'the Eighth Route Army kills and sets fires.' It's been two years since liberation here, the peasants have all been emancipated, peaceful days, so good! Damn it, those who spread rumors should be skinned alive!"
    By this time, she had finished grinding the flour. I went with her from Nanwu Village back to Landianchang, and we happened to pass the main street where Fengxi was killed, about twenty yards away from the airport. She led me over, pointing and recounting, describing the situation when Fengxi died. Her eyes turned red, she sobbed, and then gnashed her teeth and cursed the American soldiers, saying, "I am really broad-minded, otherwise! I would have died of anger long ago, with two little ones (i.e., two children) still to raise! Alas, such an unexpected thing, the eldest son is gone!"
    When she heard that the American imperialists had invaded Korea and Taiwan and wanted to invade the entire China, she said: "The Chinese people must never allow Americans to run rampant on Chinese soil again. My eldest son is disabled, and my youngest son is too young. If Fengxi were alive, he would be eighteen years old, just right to contribute to the country. Chinese people eat Chinese food and should contribute to the country, protecting national security, but now we can only produce well to help the Korean people defeat the American devils."
    On the way back, I thought silently: In China, I don't know how many wronged souls of Fengxi have not been vindicated, I don't know how many mothers of Fengxi are shedding blood and tears. The seeds of hatred sown by American imperialists in China will soon bear bitter fruit for them.

　　记住孩子的冤仇
　　丁紫
　  ——访王凤喜的母亲
    王凤喜——一个十四岁的孩子，于一九四六年三月十七日十一点钟，在北京西郊南坞村，被西郊飞机场守卫的美国兵魏斯特打死了。中国人民永远不会忘记这笔血债！
    十一月九日早晨，我为了要访问这位遭遇不幸的老太太——王凤喜的母亲，到了西郊蓝靛厂横街村。村里的农民们，正忙着在地上摘白菜，预备把那些肥美的白菜入窖。凤喜的妈妈和哥哥都没在家，我等到了中午，凤喜的妹妹秀琴、弟弟凤云放学回来了。他们两个带着我到了南坞村——他们的姨家，找到了他们正在磨面的母亲。
    我一向不会慰问人，尤其是面对这个丧失了爱子的母亲。当我向她说明来意时，她的那对眼睛，立时放射出愤恨的目光。沉默了一大会之后，才和我慢慢地诉述着四年前所发生的那桩不幸事件的经过：
    “那是旧历二月天气，我家人口多，没落子（没法生活的意思），我给凤喜和他瘸哥哥朝山五千块伪法币，让他们到飞机场附近去买美军吃剩的杂和菜，好的人吃，坏的猪吃，可以维持两天生活。那天卖杂和菜的人还没有来，他们哥俩在南坞村前街弹球玩。忽然听见飞机场有放枪的声音，瘸子（即朝山）说：‘凤喜！快走吧！美国兵放枪哪！’凤喜还天真地说：‘放枪怕什么？又不是打咱们！’后来瘸子跑了，凤喜检地上的玻璃球，就被他妈的可恶的美国兵放了六枪，把我的凤喜打死了。”说到这里，她痛苦地止住了话头，缓了一绥气后，才接着往下说：
    “他们把我儿子打死了，我连心痛带生气，死了好几个死儿，我半傻不傻地找地面（即当地伪警察）去说理，我要他们抵了我屈死的儿子。可是，国民党，从来也不向着老百姓，上了好几回美国府（即前北平美国大使馆）去过堂，让我坐在外面，他们在里面叽哩呱啦的说话，我也听不懂。他们问我要多少钱，我说让他抵命，不要钱。他们说，美国人不讲抵命。我真火了，当时若有刀，我有心把他们都砍了，我再抵了他们，就是他妈的我进不去屋里。
    “凶手脖子里挂条白线，就算犯罪了。外国人有钱有势，可以随便打死中国人，国民党不敢管人家，不让我说话，把我撵了回来，后来给了我一点钱算完事。咱们老百姓还有什么办法，不要钱也是白不要，反正是不讲理的年头。”
    他停了停，扫了扫磨盘上的剩面，放在箩里又开始箩起来说：
    “同志！你可没见我那凤喜是个多好的孩子哪！对了！你看见我那小儿子了吧，凤喜长得就像他，比他还好。”
    我赶快找小凤云，可是不知道什么功夫他跑出去玩去了。我记得他那小样子，圆圆的脸，灼灼的目光，显得很聪明伶俐，活活泼泼的孩童气中，透露着坚强意志的表情，她接着说：
    “我那凤喜，在学校里念书时，没有那个老师不爱他的，书念得好极了，他‘接三’（即人死后第三天举行‘超渡灵魂’的仪式）的那天，几个老师都哭了。唉！他爸爸早死了，我一个人带他们哥弟四个，巴巴结结供他念这点书，容易吗？您说，一个十四岁的孩子，无缘无故被他们打死了，还说我孩子去偷他们东西去了，美国兵简直就是畜牲。我恨不能咬他两口才解恨。
    “现在我完全明白了，谁是真正给老百姓出气的人。国民党把我二亩地修了炮楼，三年多不能生产。住在我家，吃了我两只下蛋的母鸡，我央告他，他还要吃我那两只，整天祸害我，可把我害苦了。幸亏前年被解放军打跑了，解放军住在我家，天天扫院子，出来进去的叫我老大娘，还总说打扰了我。解放前，那些王八却造谣说‘八路军杀人放火’。这儿解放两年了，农民都翻身了，挺太平的日子，多好哇！他妈的，造谣的人真该剐了他！”
    这时候，她已把面磨完了，我和他一道从南坞村回蓝靛厂，正好路过风喜被打死的前街，距离飞机场总有二十来丈远，她把我领过去，指点着、诉说着，描划着凤喜死时的情形，她眼圈红了，抽泣了一下，随后又咬牙切齿的骂了一顿美国兵，并说：“我真是心宽的，不然！我早气死了，底下还有两个小不点儿（即两个小孩）哪！唉，真是想不到的事儿，老大的小子没有了！”
    当他听说美帝侵略了朝鲜、台湾又要侵略整个中国时，她说：“中国人民绝不能再叫美国人在中国土地上横行霸道了。我的大儿子是个残废，小儿子又太小，凤喜活着十八岁了，正好为国家出力。中国人吃中国人的饭，就应该给国家出力，保卫国家安全，但是，现在我们只有好好生产来帮助朝鲜人民把美国鬼子打败。”
    在归途中，我默默地想：在中国，不知有多少个凤喜的冤魂未得到昭雪，不知有多少个凤喜的母亲在流着血泪，美帝国主义者在中国撒下的这样多仇恨的种子，他们自食恶果的日子快到了。
