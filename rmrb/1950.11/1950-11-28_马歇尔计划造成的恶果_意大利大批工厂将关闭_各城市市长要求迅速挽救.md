　　The Evil Consequences of the Marshall Plan
    A Large Number of Factories in Italy Will Close
    Mayors of Various Cities Demand Prompt Rescue
    [Xinhua News Agency Dispatch] TASS, Rome, 24th: Italian municipal authorities oppose the Marshall Plan's effects of closing metallurgical and machine-manufacturing factories in Italy.
    A municipal conference was held in Milan, attended by the mayors of Venice, Livorno, Reggio nell'Emilia, Brescia, La Spezia, Savona, and other cities where factories are at risk of being shut down. Many engineers and representatives of all trade unions also attended the conference.
    The conference participants passed a resolution stating that the cities they represented were completely dependent on the normal operation of factories for their livelihoods, and now these factories face the danger of disintegration. The mayors, representing the people of these cities, demanded the implementation of necessary plans to put industry on a sound basis in order to solve this problem quickly.
