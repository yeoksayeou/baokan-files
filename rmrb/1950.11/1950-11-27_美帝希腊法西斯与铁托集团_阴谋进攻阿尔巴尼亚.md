　　Xinhua News Agency, 26th: US imperialism, Greek royalist fascists, and the Yugoslav Tito clique are preparing to invade Albania. According to a TASS dispatch from Paris on the 25th, citing a report in *l'Humanité*: Diplomatic personnel from the Greek royalist fascists and the Tito clique are scheduled to hold a meeting in Athens to formulate a joint plan to invade Albania. The Greek ambassador to France, who has been acting as a liaison between the two sides in Paris, will go to Athens to attend the meeting.

　　According to a report from CTK, Prague, citing a broadcast from the Free Greece Radio on the 24th: On the 4th of this month, the Ministers of the Navy, Army, and Air Force of the Athens Cabinet and staff officers from the Armed Forces Headquarters held a meeting in which the US Ambassador to Greece, Mr. Puryear, and officials from the US Mission participated. The topic of discussion was "attacking Albania." The broadcast stated that the US Ambassador had visited the province of Epirus, which borders Albania, a few days ago, similar to Dulles' inspection of the 38th parallel before launching the attack on North Korea. Recently, a large number of tanks, artillery, and aircraft have been transported to Greece, and the number of US bombers and jet fighters based at Greek airfields has greatly increased compared to last year. The Tito clique is also making preparations. The broadcast pointed out that the Greek government's claim to send troops to Korea is only to divert people's attention. Recently, provocations by royalist fascists against the Albanian border have been increasing. Newspapers and radio stations in Athens are preparing for the invasion, spreading rumors that the Greek minority in Albania is being "persecuted." Free Greece Radio called on the Greek people to resolutely crush this conspiracy to attack the Albanian people.

　　美帝希腊法西斯与铁托集团
    阴谋进攻阿尔巴尼亚
    【新华社二十六日讯】美帝国主义和希腊保皇法西斯与南斯拉夫铁托集团正准备侵略阿尔巴尼亚。据塔斯社巴黎二十五日讯引人道报消息：希腊保皇法西斯与铁托集团的外交人员即将在雅典举行会议，拟订联合侵略阿尔巴尼亚的计划。曾在巴黎为南、希两方进行联络的希腊驻法大使，将赴雅典参加会议。
    据电通社布拉格讯引自由希腊电台二十四日广播称：本月四日雅典内阁的海、陆、空军部长和武装部队总部的参谋军官曾举行会议，美国驻希大使普利孚和美国使团官员均曾参加，讨论的题目便是“进攻阿尔巴尼亚”。广播称：几天以前美国大使曾去过与阿尔巴尼亚毗邻的埃匹萨斯省，这与杜勒斯在发动对北朝鲜的进攻以前到三八线去视察一事相似。新近大批的坦克、大炮、和飞机已运往希腊，以希腊飞机场为基地的美国轰炸机和喷气战斗机的数目较去年大为增加。铁托集团也在进行着准备。广播指出：希腊政府声称要派军队赴朝鲜只是用来分散人们的注意力的。近来保皇法西斯分子对阿尔巴尼亚边境的挑衅日益增多。雅典的报纸和广播正为侵略进行准备，造谣说阿尔巴尼亚境内的希腊少数民族受到“迫害”。自由希腊电台号召希腊人民坚决粉碎这一进攻阿尔巴尼亚人民的阴谋计划。
