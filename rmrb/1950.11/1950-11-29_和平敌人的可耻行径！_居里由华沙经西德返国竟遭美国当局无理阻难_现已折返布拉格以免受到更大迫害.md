Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 26th: According to TASS, Professor Joliot-Curie, Chairman of the World Peace Council and renowned French scientist, was detained and insulted by American and West German police acting on the orders of the American authorities while passing through the German border on his way back from Warsaw, and has been forced to return to Prague. Upon arriving in Prague, Joliot-Curie told a Czechoslovak News Agency reporter: “Although I had a formal passport, I was not allowed to pass through the border. This is the same provocative act as the obstruction of hundreds of delegates attending the Second World Peace Congress at the British border, and it was all instigated by the Americans."

Joliot-Curie continued to describe the details of the persecution as follows: After passing the Czech border at the German station of Schirnding, West German police officers checked his passport and, upon discovering the name of the Chairman of the World Peace Council, said he was not allowed to pass through West Germany. Joliot-Curie stated that he had received formal permission from the Americans to pass through the border, but the police officers simply replied: "This is an order from the Americans, issued by the American authorities on the morning of the 23rd, because they knew that Joliot-Curie would be passing through the border that day." The West German police then ordered Joliot-Curie to get off the train and interrogated him unreasonably. When Joliot-Curie asked to buy food and water, the American police deliberately made things difficult, limiting him to exchanging US dollars for marks, and not allowing him to exchange British pounds or French francs, which resulted in him being unable to eat or drink. Joliot-Curie said: “This interrogation was very similar to the situation in which I was interrogated for twelve hours by the German police in the Paris police station during the Nazi occupation. Later, I requested to be released by telephone, and the reply was that I had to submit an application. But I had already obtained permission in my passport. In order to avoid further insults and persecution, I decided to return to Prague.”

　　和平敌人的可耻行径！
    居里由华沙经西德返国  竟遭美国当局无理阻难
    现已折返布拉格以免受到更大迫害
    【新华社二十八日讯】据塔斯社布拉格二十六日讯：世界保卫和平委员会主席、法国著名科学家约里奥——居里教授，在由华沙返国途中道经德国边境时，被奉美国当局命令的美国与西德警察扣留侮辱，已被迫折返布拉格。约里奥——居里在抵达布拉格时告捷克斯洛伐克通讯社记者称：我虽然持有正式的护照，但却不能过境。这和数百名出席第二届世界保卫和平大会的代表们在英国边境上的被阻难一样，都是挑衅的行为，而且都是美国人主使的。
    约里奥——居里继谈遭受迫害的详情如下：在德国希恩丁站通过捷克边境以后，西德警察人员检查护照发现世界保卫和平大会主席的名字，便说不准他通过西德。约里奥——居里声明他是得到美国人的正式允许过境的，警察人员简单地回答说：这是美国人的命令，是美国当局在二十三日早晨下达的，因为他们知道约里奥——居里要在那天过境。西德警察即勒令约里奥——居里下车，加以无理盘问，当约里奥——居里要求购买食物及饮水时，美国警察故意刁难，限他用美元去换马克，而不能用英镑或法郎去换，结果使他不得饮食。约里奥——居里说：这次盘问和我在纳粹占领期间被德国警察在巴黎警察局盘问十二小时的情形极相类似。其后我用电话要求放行，答复是要我提出申请书。但我已在护照中得到允许了。为了避免受到进一步的侮辱和迫害，我决定回到布拉格来。
