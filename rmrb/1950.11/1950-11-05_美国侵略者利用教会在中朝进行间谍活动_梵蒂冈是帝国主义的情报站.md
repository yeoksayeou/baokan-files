Xinhua News Agency, 4th - According to a dispatch from Radiopress in Washington: American imperialism is using reactionary elements within the Catholic Church in Korea, under the authority of the Vatican, to conduct espionage. They have now established a joint US-Vatican intelligence center to direct and coordinate espionage activities in Korea and mainland China.

Willoughby (Chief of the Intelligence Section of MacArthur Headquarters), the head of American spies in Japan, praised this "service" of the Vatican in his talks with other officials. He particularly praised the church headed by Bishop Byrne in Seoul. He said that this church frequently provides intelligence about the deployment of North Korean troops, industrial targets, and other important locations. This intelligence has proven to be of great value for the American plans to bomb Korean territory. It is reported that a senior American official who just returned to Washington from Korea has submitted a report on the Vatican's espionage agency supplying valuable intelligence to the American troops in Korea.

　　美国侵略者利用教会在中朝进行间谍活动
    梵蒂冈是帝国主义的情报站
    【新华社四日讯】据电通社华盛顿讯：美帝国主义正通过梵蒂冈派驻朝鲜的天主教会中的反动分子，进行间谍活动。它们现在已建立一个美国——梵蒂冈联合情报中心站，负责指挥并调配在朝鲜及中国大陆上的间谍活动。
    美国在日本的特务头子威洛贝（麦克阿瑟总部谍报组组长）在与其他官员谈话时，曾极口称赞梵蒂冈这种“服务”。他特别赞扬教皇派驻汉城的鲍以恩为首的教会。他说：这种教会经常提供关于北朝鲜部队的部署、工业目标及其他重要地点的情报。这些情报对于美国策划轰炸朝鲜领土证明有很大的价值。据悉：刚从朝鲜返抵华盛顿的一位美国高级官员，曾就梵蒂冈间谍机关向美国在朝鲜的军队供给有价值的情报一事，提出报告。
