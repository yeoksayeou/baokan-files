Northeast Acheng Veteran's Home War Blind Team
Expresses Determination to Defend the Motherland to Chairman Mao

We have already dedicated our eyes to the Motherland, and we will dedicate every bit of our strength to the beloved Motherland and the peace-loving people of the world.

Respected Chairman Mao:

Under your wise leadership and the correct line of the Party, for the past twenty years, we have fought against domestic and foreign bandits—Japanese invaders, American imperialists, and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. In the struggle to win freedom and national independence for the Motherland, we have been loyal to the people and the Motherland, and have dedicated our beloved eyes.

We heard that our Motherland solemnly declared its founding to the world. In the past year, our work has developed by leaps and bounds, and the lives of workers and peasants have improved. Here, we actively study policies and theories, and constantly study your thoughts to arm our minds and raise our ideological awareness. Our eyes are blind, but our minds are not disabled. Our hands and brains are still moving and still learning.

This peaceful and beautiful life is all given to us by you—dear Chairman Mao.

The seeds of revolution have borne abundant fruit, but the enemies of China's peace and the enemies of the world's people—American imperialists—are igniting the flames of aggression in our neighbor Korea and are expanding their aggression. The bandit-like planes of American imperialism have carried out countless provocative acts in the sacred airspace of our Motherland, the Northeast. These despicable acts are alerting us that American imperialism is unwilling to accept its defeat in China and its defeat in Korea. It wants to seize any fruit that we have personally cultivated with our blood and sweat. Can we still tolerate this? We are always prepared to sacrifice blood for the defense of our Motherland, and we are always ready to dedicate our strength—even if it is just a little bit—to our Motherland, to the peace-loving people of the world, and to you—the strong defender of peace—Chairman Mao!

With utmost respect,

The entire class of the Northeast Acheng Veteran's Home War Blind Team

　　东北阿城荣军院战盲队
    向毛主席表示保卫祖国决心      
    我们已为祖国献出了双目，还要把一点一滴力量都贡献给可爱的祖国和全世界和平人民。
    敬爱的毛主席：
    在你的英明领导下，在党的正确路线下，我们二十年来抗击着国内外的匪徒—日本强盗、美帝国主义、蒋介石匪帮，在争取祖国自由、民族独立的斗争中，我们忠实于人民于祖国。贡献了我们可爱的双目。
    我们听到了我们祖国在世界上庄严地宣布成立了，一年来我们工作在突飞猛进中发展，工人、农人生活提高了。我们在这里积极学习政策理论，时时在学习你的思想，来武装我们的头脑，提高我们思想意识。我们眼睛失明了，然而我们的思想没有残废，我们的手和脑子还在动，还在学习。
    这种和平美好的生活都是你啊——亲爱的毛主席所给予我们的。
    革命的种子已结起肥硕的果实，但中国的和平仇敌、世界人民的仇敌——美帝国主义，正在我们的邻居朝鲜燃起了侵略的战火，并正在扩大侵略。美帝盗匪式的飞机，在我神圣祖国的领空东北，进行无数次挑衅的行为。这些卑劣的行为都在警惕着我们，美帝是不甘心在中国的失败、在朝鲜的失败，他想夺取我们亲自用血汗培植起来的任何果实，这我们还能容忍吗？我们时时准备着为保卫祖国而牺牲流血，我们时时准备我们的力量——那管是一点一滴也决心贡献给我们的祖国，贡献给全世界爱好和平的人们，贡献给你——和平的坚强保卫者——毛主席！此致
    敬礼
    东北阿城荣院战盲队全体同学谨启
    十一月五日
