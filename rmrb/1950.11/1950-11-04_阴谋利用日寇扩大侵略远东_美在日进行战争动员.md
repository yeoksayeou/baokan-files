　　Xinhua News Agency, 3rd: In order to use Japan's power to further expand the US's war of aggression in the Far East, US imperialism is currently intensifying war mobilization in Japan. It is reported that the Japanese government has stepped up conscription, expecting to conscript 80,000 soldiers by the end of October and station them in the Hokkaido area. According to a Kyodo News Agency Tokyo dispatch, Justice Minister Takeo Ohashi and "Police Reserve Force" Director-General Keikichi Masuhara publicly declared on October 26 that former military personnel who were recently purged by MacArthur would be allowed to join the "Police Reserve Force" after being "educated." According to an International News Service report, Ohashi Takeo also blatantly clamored in the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee that Japan could openly establish an army.
    In mid-August, the US Eighth Army Headquarters held a meeting of Japanese military officers in Tokyo, attended by Japanese generals and above who had fought against the Soviet Union and China. This meeting was clearly related to the US conspiracy to expand its war of aggression.
    Japan's industry has also significantly shifted to military production. The prices of steel, copper, iron, medicine, and other materials in Japan have risen by 30% to 50% compared to before the US imperialist war of aggression against Korea broke out. According to a Reuters dispatch, as of October 15, according to the contracts signed between the US and Japan, the Japanese military industry had supplied the US military invading Korea with more than $75,330,000 worth of materials and $51,390,000 worth of repair, processing, transportation, construction, and other labor services.

　　阴谋利用日寇扩大侵略远东
    美在日进行战争动员
    【新华社三日讯】美帝国主义为了利用日本的力量进一步扩大美国在远东的侵略战争，现正在日本加紧进行战争动员。据悉，日本政府已加紧征兵，预计到十月底征兵八万人，派至北海道一带驻屯。据共同社东京讯，法务府总裁大桥武夫及“警察后备队”长官增原惠吉在十月二十六日公然宣称，最近被麦克阿瑟解除整肃的前军人，加以“教育”后，准许他们参加“警察后备队”。另据国际新闻社消息，大桥武夫还在众院外交事务委员会上明目张胆地叫嚣日本可以公开建立军队。
    八月中旬，美国第八军司令部曾在东京召开日本军官会议，由曾经对苏联和中国作战的日本将级以上的军官参加。这一会议显然与美国扩大侵略战争的阴谋有关。
    日本工业方面也显著地转向军需生产。日本的钢、铜、铁、药品等物资价格较美帝侵略朝鲜战争爆发前已上涨百分之三十至百分之五十。据路透社讯，截至十月十五日为止，根据美、日双方签订的合同，日本军需工业共供应侵略朝鲜的美军物资七千五百三十三万余美元，及修理、加工、运输、建筑等劳务五千一百三十九万余美元。
