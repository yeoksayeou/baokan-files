Flames of Anger Burn in the Hegang Coal Mine
    Defend happiness! The fruits of our arduous creation!
    The anger and hatred of the thousands of workers at the Hegang Coal Mine, caused by the American imperialists' acts of aggression, erupted like a volcano! The gathering places, once filled with songs, are now filled with angry roars and solemn vows. People seem to have grown many times stronger than a few days ago, with deep eyes, resolute steps, and clenched fists, as if they are about to crush something that hinders progress, to chop down a harmful beast, to kill an enemy. The aggression of the United States reminds people of all kinds of dark and tragic past events. The old workers often talk about the "Ten Thousand People Pit" of the puppet Manchukuo era, and they recount with grief and indignation how their partners were dragged alive into the "Ten Thousand People Pit;" how the "foremen" were harsh; how the Japanese devils drove the workers into the pit with big sticks, saying to the workers: "You are like pigs, it doesn't matter if you die, just get the coal out!" That hellish situation clearly tells everyone – imperialism is the devil, is the wolf, and if you allow it to rush in, you will be bitten or eaten, and your children and grandchildren will forever become its food.
    Recently, people have also often talked about the days of these five years since liberation, how difficult and challenging the first few years were, and how much blood and sweat everyone shed to overcome the enemy and establish their new life! In the winter of 1946, in the days of wind and snow, there was a rebellion of the "foremen" internally, and the "Central Bandits" attacked externally; there was no food, so they ate chaff and moldy grains; the shoes were broken, so they wrapped their feet in rags; the cotton coats could not keep out the cold, so they wore burlap sacks; there was no light in the pit, so they went down holding hands, and there was gas (poisonous gas) in the yard, so they dipped a towel in vinegar and put it over their noses. But everyone knew that they were working for themselves, and so they produced coal, produced coal, and went down into the pit to produce coal under any circumstances! Why? Because the People's Liberation Army was fighting in the freezing weather of minus forty degrees, but the chimneys of the factories producing supplies for the front were not smoking; the trains stopped halfway because there was no fuel! We all remember the workers Wang Shaowu and Cui Ruitai, who worked in the pit for not just three or two days, but for a month or two, day and night! We all remember that the worker Tian Juchuan refused to leave the power station for months on end, and he worked on live equipment in the absence of safety tools, and his weak body made him unable to maintain his balance, and his arm was taken away by electricity! That hardship, that difficulty, was finally victoriously overcome. Now, after hard work, they live in tall buildings, eat rice, white flour and pork, a new shaft is being opened here, and new streets are being planned there, gardens are being built, schools are being built, and an infinitely beautiful life is beginning, but the American wolves want to break in! Old worker Du Jinchen cried out: "Only wooden people don't get angry, only natural slaves will watch the American devils come in!" The Chinese people, the employees of Hegang, know how to create happiness, and also know how to defend happiness. They are angry, they are taking strong action!
    Join the Volunteer Army! Fight alongside our Korean brothers!
    The first action of anger is to demand to join the Volunteer Army and go to Korea to beat the American devils. The number of people from various organizations and groups who volunteer to go to Korea to participate in the war is increasing day by day. Rong Jun, a worker at the No. 108 mine, Wang Licai, requested to join the Volunteer Army to help the Korean people. He said: "I joined the War of Liberation in 1946, and I was with Korean comrades three times in Jiangnan, we were like brothers, sharing joys and sorrows, now their home is invaded by robbers, I can't just watch, although I was injured, but I can still fight, I want to go to Korea!" Worker Li Yuxiang said: "The American imperialists will not let us live a good life, they want to invade us, my lungs are about to explode with anger, I want to join the Volunteer Army!" Cultural teacher Li Yufu said: "I am a Chinese youth, at the critical moment of the motherland, I am willing to go to the forefront of the battle; although I love my cultural and educational career so much." Two coiling female workers at the electromechanical plant also want to sign up to join the Volunteer Army. They said with tears in their eyes: "We want to fight the American devils, we want to learn from Guo Junqing, why can't we go? We can't wait for the devils to come and ruin us!" Ding Xingfu patted his chest and said: "During the War of Resistance, I fought against the Japanese devils; during the War of Liberation, I fought against the reactionaries. At first, those murderers had better weapons than us, but what happened after fighting? Where did the Japanese devils go? Where did the reactionaries go? They all collapsed! Now our army has airplanes and cannons, what are the American devils? I will definitely join the Volunteer Army and drive them out of Korea!" Medical personnel also stood up, female nurses and female doctors prepared to cut their hair, and they asked to join the battlefield medical care. Doctors Huang Zhanyan and Luo Yaode said: "We came from the south to the northeast for the construction of the motherland, now the imperialists want to attack us, in order to defend the fruits of construction, we ask to go to Korea and use our technology to serve the wounded and sick!" There are too many, such examples are endless. Those who cannot join the Volunteer Army express their determination to defend the motherland with various material support. Old worker Wei Dengyu took out twenty work points and said: "I am old, I cannot directly fight the American devils, I will take out twenty work points every month to support." Thirty-nine staff members and cadres from the Planning Department of the Mining Bureau collected 3,596,000 yuan (Northeast currency) for the use of supporting the Korean people and our volunteer troops, of which Ren Zhi alone donated twenty work points, and they vowed to step up their work, save materials, and buy more public bonds. Some of these people are not prominent on weekdays, but when the motherland is facing a major enemy, when the cause of truth and justice calls to them, they all rise up like giants.
    Increase production and practice thrift, launch a patriotic competition!
    At the same time as the demand to join the Volunteer Army, the patriotic production competition is also being carried out like a prairie fire. First of all, in the Sixth Mine, after all the employees heard the call of the trade union, they immediately gathered, and those who came out of the pit did not even wash their faces, and each held a big fist like an iron hammer, with bright eyes, and everyone unanimously supported Foreign Minister Zhou and the joint declaration of various parties, resolutely responded to the call of the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions, and used practical actions to resist the United States, aid Korea, protect the home and defend the country. After the meeting, the mine director and labor hero Sun Haoqing supervised production while doing it himself. Technicians stayed in the pit all day long. Staff members also automatically went down into the pit to mine coal outside of working hours. Hooking and transporting workers pushed the carts back and forth like running water. Each class competed fiercely with each other, and the arrow of output rose day by day, creating amazing new records. The daily output of the First Mine increased by nearly doubled. After the trial cone survey team launched the red flag competition, the labor productivity per work increased by 0.067 meters, exceeding the original plan. The Third Mine had failed to complete the production task for a long time. After the launch of the patriotic competition between the inclined shafts, the task was overfulfilled in the first ten days of November. And there were no serious injuries or deaths. Labor hero Yu Hongen, the mine director of the Third Mine, said at the general meeting: "Why can we increase production? Because we don't want to be slaves again! We want to protect our good life!" The workers rushed to the stage to speak. The representative of the Second Inclined Shaft said: "The Second Inclined Shaft will increase production and guarantee to exceed the task by 10%!" The representative of the Third Inclined Shaft said: "The Third Inclined Shaft will not only exceed 10%, but also resolutely guarantee the quality and guarantee no accidents!" The First Inclined Shaft said: "In addition, we also guarantee an attendance rate of more than 95%!" Usually silent units also came to the stage to speak, the electromechanical section guaranteed that the machines would be repaired, and the security section guaranteed that no accidents would occur. In the competition, many moving model deeds appeared. Many people finished their own work and went to help others; those who used to disagree shook hands tightly when they met and went to work shoulder to shoulder; Luan Zhengyun, who used to be mischievous, is now working hard.
    Simultaneous with the upsurge of the production competition was the movement to demand shorter rest times and donate equipment. All the coal mining workers in one mine proposed to reduce two public holidays each month. The security, transportation, and preparation sections proposed not to have public holidays. The workers of another mine also proposed to stop the rotation, they said: "If we don't defeat the American imperialists, we won't rest!" Workers Su Bingzhu, Shan Baozhu, Li Huaiyu, etc. of one mine not only donated their own equipment, but also went to find it elsewhere, and carried it back with poles. Old lady Sun took out the equipment she had kept in the puppet Manchukuo era and said: "I don't have much use for it, give it to the public to produce more, so as to increase strength." By November 10, a mine had received 300 shovels, 400 picks, and 100 drill rods in more than ten days, and the movement is still developing to outside mines.

　　愤怒之火燃烧在鹤岗煤矿
    保卫幸福！我们艰辛缔造的果实！
    鹤岗煤矿的万千职工，被美国帝国主义的侵略暴行所引起的愤怒与仇恨，像火山一样爆发了！一向充满歌声的各聚会场所，现在被暴怒的吼声和庄严的誓言占据了。人们好像比几天前壮大了多少倍，深沉的眼光，坚决的步伐，紧握的拳头，好像正要去粉碎一种阻碍前进的什么东西，去斩除一只害人的野兽，去杀一个仇敌。美帝的侵略使人想起各种黑暗与悲惨的往事。老工人们又时常讲起伪满时代的“万人坑”，他们悲愤地诉说那活活被拖进“万人坑”的自己的伙伴；诉说“把头”怎样苛薄人；诉说日本鬼子怎样用大棒子往坑里赶工人，对工人说：“你们猪的一样，死啦死啦没关系，煤的拿出来行！”那种人间地狱的情形，清楚的告诉大家——帝国主义就是魔鬼，就是饿狼，允许它冲进来，不是被咬伤就是被吃掉，子子孙孙就要永远成为它的嘴头菜。
    最近人们也时常讲起，解放以后这五年的日子，头几年是多么艰苦和困难，大家为了战胜敌人，为了建立自己的新生活，流了多少血和汗呵！？在一九四六年冬天，那风雪交加的日子里，内有“把头”叛乱，外有“中央胡子”进攻；粮食没有了，吃糠，吃霉谷子；鞋子破了，用破布把脚包上；棉袄挂不住身了，披麻袋片；坑内没有灯，手拉手摸着下去，场子里有瓦斯（毒气），用手巾蘸上醋，兜在鼻子上。但是大家知道，这是为自己干活，就这样，出煤，出煤，在任何情况下也下坑出煤！为什么呢？因为人民解放军在零下四十度的冰天雪地里作战，可是为前方生产物资的工厂烟筒不冒烟了；火车走到中途就因没燃料停下了！我们都记得工人王绍武、崔瑞台，他们曾不是三天两天，而是一个月两个月的，不分昼夜地在坑里干！我们都记得，工人田巨川一连几个月不肯离开发电所一步，在缺乏安全工具条件下，他带电作业，虚弱的身体使他不能保持平衡，胳臂被电夺去了！那艰苦，那困难，终于胜利的战斗过来了。现在，经过辛劳缔造，住上大楼了，吃上大米白面猪肉了，这里在开立井，那里在计划新街市，修花园，盖学校，无限美好的生活正在开始，可是美国狼要想闯进来！杜尽臣老工人大声疾呼：“木头人才不上火，天生的奴才才看着美国鬼子进来呢！”中国人民，鹤岗员工们，知道怎样缔造幸福，也知道怎样保卫幸福。他们愤怒了，他们坚强地行动起来了！
    参加志愿军！与朝鲜兄弟并肩作战去！
    愤怒的第一种行动，是要求参加志愿军，去朝鲜揍美国鬼子。各机关，各团体，志愿请求去朝鲜参战的人，一天比一天多。一○八号场子荣军工友王立财，要求参加志愿军去援助朝鲜人民。他说：“我一九四六年参加解放战争，曾和朝鲜同志一起三下江南，我们像亲兄弟一样，同甘苦、共患难，现在他们家里来强盗了，我决不能看着，我虽然受了伤，但是我还能作战，我要求到朝鲜去！”李玉祥工友说：“美帝不让我们过好日子，要侵略我们，我的肺都快气炸啦，我要参加志愿军！”文化教员李愚夫说：“我是中国青年，在祖国危急的关头，我愿到战斗的最前线去；虽然我是多么热爱我的文教事业。”机电厂的两个卷线女工，也要报名参加志愿军。她们泪眼滂沱地说：“我们要去打美国鬼子，我们要学习郭俊卿，为什么我们不能去呢？我们不能等鬼子来糟塌！”丁兴富拍拍自己的胸膛说：“在抗战的时候，俺打过日本鬼子；解放战争时候，俺打过反动派。一开始，那些杀人犯，武器都比咱好，可是打来打去怎的啦？日本鬼子那去啦？反动派那去啦？统统垮啦！现在咱军队飞机大炮都有，美国鬼子算啥？俺一定参加志愿军，把他打出朝鲜去！”医务人员们也都起来了，女护士、女医师准备剪掉头发，他们要求参加战地医疗。黄展延、罗耀德医生说：“我们从南方来东北，是为了祖国的建设，现在帝国主义要来袭击我们，为了保卫建设的成果，我们要求到朝鲜去，把我们的技术，为伤病员服务！”太多了，这样的例子是举不完的。不能去参加志愿军的人，用各种物质支援，表示保卫祖国的决心。魏登羽老工友拿出二十工分来，他说：“我老了，不能直接去打美国鬼子，我每月拿出二十工分来支援。”矿务局计划处三十九名职员干部，汇集了三百五十九万六千元（东北币）作为支援朝鲜人民和我志愿部队之用，其中任志一个人捐献二十工分，他们发誓加紧工作，节约物资，多买公债。这些人，有的在平日并不突出，可是当祖国面临大敌的时候，当真理与正义的事业，向他们和她们呼唤的时候，他们就都巨人似地奋起了。
    增产节约，展开爱国主义竞赛！
    在要求参加志愿军的同时，爱国主义生产竞赛，也像烈火燎原似地干起来了。首先是第六矿，全体员工听到工会的号召后，立即集会，从坑里出来的人连脸也不去洗，一个个握着铁锤似的大拳头，灼灼的眼光，大家一致拥护周外长和各党派联合宣言，坚决响应东北总工会号召，用实际行动抗美援朝保家卫国。会后，矿长劳动英雄孙好清，一边督促生产，一边自己下手干起来。技术员整天在坑内不离开一步。职员们在工作时间外，也自动下坑采煤。登钩、运搬工友像流水似地来回推车。各班互相热烈地竞赛起来，产量的箭头一天比一天上升，连创惊人的新纪录。一矿日产量提高了近一倍。试锥调查队展开红旗竞赛后，每工劳动生产率提高了○·○六七米，超过了原订计划。三矿过去很长期间完不成生产任务。自展开各斜井间爱国主义竞赛后，十一月份第一旬，就超额完成了任务。且未出重伤和死亡事故。三矿矿长劳动英雄于洪恩在全体大会上说：“咱们为啥能提高产量？因为咱不愿再当亡国奴！咱要保住咱的好日子！”工人们抢着上台讲话。二斜井代表说：“二斜井还要提高产量，保证超过任务百分之十！”三斜井代表说：“三斜井不但要超过百分之十，还坚决保证质量，保证不出事故！”一斜井的说：“另外我们还保证出勤百分之九十五以上！”平常沉寂的单位也都上台讲话了，机电股保证机器修好，保安股保证不出事故。在竞赛中，出现了很多动人的模范事迹。很多人把自己的工作作完就去帮别人作；以往闹意见的，见面紧紧地握握手，肩靠肩工作去了；以往挑皮捣蛋的栾正云现在也努力工作了。
    和生产竞赛热潮同时而来的，是要求缩短休息时间和献交器材运动。一个矿的全体采煤工友提出每月减少两个公休日。保安、运输、整备各股提出不要公休了。另一个矿的工友也提出停止轮休，他们说：“不打垮美帝侵略，我们不休息了！”一个矿的工友苏柄柱、单宝珠、李怀玉等不但献出自家的器材，还到外处去找，找到了用挑子往回挑。孙老太太把她在伪满时代存留的器材都拿了出来，她说：“俺留它没大用项，交给公家多生产，好增加力量。”某矿到十一月十日止的十几天中，已经收到三百把锹、四百把镐、一百根钎子了，运动还正在向外矿发展。
