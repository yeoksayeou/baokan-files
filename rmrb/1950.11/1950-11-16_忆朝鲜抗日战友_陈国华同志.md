　　Remembering a Korean Anti-Japanese Comrade-in-Arms – Comrade Chen Guohua
　　Shi Xiangrong
　　In the summer of 1943, I heard that a Korean comrade had come to a village near my hometown, so I went to see him with a strange feeling. When I saw him, he was sitting on the kang (heated brick bed), a pistol beside him. After a brief introduction, I learned that he was the Korean comrade Chen Guohua I had heard about for a long time. When I asked him why he also joined the Anti-Japanese War, he firmly stated: "Japanese devils are the enemy of the Chinese people and also the enemy of the Korean people; defeating the devils and liberating China will also liberate Korea..." His fluent Chinese and his resolute and brave spirit made me feel only sympathy and admiration. From this conversation, I also learned that he had been participating in the revolution for seven years. He had gone to Yan'an to join the Eighth Route Army (now the People's Liberation Army) before the "July 7th" Incident, and later went deep behind enemy lines, fighting in various places. Because there was a "North China Reclamation" rice paddy established by the Japanese invaders in my hometown, (Note 1) among the farmers who cultivated the rice paddies, there were more than 3,000 Korean rice farmers who were forcibly "transferred" by the Japanese invaders. Comrade Chen Guohua's main task was to lead the Korean farmers' anti-Japanese struggle. That conversation greatly enhanced my internationalist and patriotic thinking, and made me feel that our Anti-Japanese War was not only not isolated among our own people, but also not isolated internationally. At the same time, due to the Japanese invaders' aggression, the feelings of the Chinese and Korean people and their hatred for the Japanese invaders were merged together.
　　Soon, the name of Comrade Chen Guohua quickly spread throughout the area. The folks everywhere talked about it with curiosity: "Koreans are also fighting against the Japanese with us!" This also became a weapon for comrades to encourage each other and inspire the folks' enthusiasm for resisting Japan. Every time Comrade Chen Guohua went to a place, he would be surrounded by the folks, who would ask him to speak at mass meetings to introduce the Japanese invaders' abuse of the Korean people to every Chinese person. I remember once, at a mass meeting in Anniudian (Luannan County, Tangshan Prefecture), when he talked about the inhuman life after the Japanese invaders destroyed Korea, he choked up and couldn't speak, and the audience followed him in tears. He often liked to say: "The heart of the Chinese people will not die, and the heart of the Korean people will not die." These words were also deeply imprinted in the minds of the folks in that area, and they regarded them as famous sayings for the Anti-Japanese War.
　　In order to facilitate their rule, the Japanese invaders tried to create contradictions between the various ethnic groups, including the Chinese and Korean people. At that time, there were more than 3,000 Chinese farmers in Baigezhuang "North China Reclamation" who were planting rice paddies for the Japanese invaders. In order to create contradictions between the Chinese and Korean ethnic groups, the Japanese invaders treated them differently in every aspect. For example, Chinese rice farmers were not allowed to enter the Korean "sections" (Note 2), and Koreans could move freely when leaving the rice paddies, while Chinese were subjected to strict inspections; even though they were cultivating rice paddies for the Japanese invaders, after the rice was harvested, Korean rice farmers could keep rice to eat for a year, while Chinese rice farmers were only given soybean cakes and sorghum. Even when harvesting rice, it was a "crime" to steal a single grain of rice! The Japanese invaders attempted to use this to elevate the status of Korean rice farmers so that they could monitor Chinese farmers and facilitate their rule over the Chinese and Korean people.
　　However, this plan of the Japanese invaders completely failed later. After Comrade Chen Guohua came here to work, he quickly went deep into the rice paddy fields under the strict rule of the Japanese invaders, first laying a foundation among the Korean rice farmers. When sowing seeds in the spring, he led the rice farmers to deliberately not sow or sow less, and take out the fertilizer powder issued by the Japanese invaders or throw it into the ditch..., trying every means to make the rice fields barren, reduce rice seedlings, and reduce production. During the autumn harvest, he tried to trample underground, reduce the amount of rice threshed, and so on, to deal with the Japanese invaders. The Japanese invaders had issued one or two heads of cattle to each household of Chinese and Korean rice farmers. Comrade Chen Guohua then led the "pulling" cattle movement. At first, he taught the rice farmers to take the cattle out at night and then report to the Japanese invaders that they had been "pulled away by the Eighth Route Army." Later, it aroused the suspicion of the Japanese invaders, and Comrade Chen Guohua personally organized the nearby militia to "pull" them away at night. I remember that one night, thirty-one heads were pulled out.
　　Comrade Chen Guohua not only led the Chinese and Korean rice farmers in carrying out struggles in the rice paddies, but also gradually armed the Korean rice farmers who were unwilling to continue to be driven by the Japanese invaders into a "Korean People's Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army." Comrade Chen Guohua led this "Volunteer Army" to operate in the rice paddy area along the south of the Beining Railway. Sometimes they dispersed, disguised, and sneaked into Baigezhuang Street or the rice paddies to attack the Japanese invaders and capture traitors. Sometimes they fought side by side with the local Chinese guerrillas to jointly strike at the Japanese invaders. When I saw him again in the summer of 1945, the "Korean People's Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army" he led had expanded into a team of more than two hundred people.
　　This is one of the historical facts of the Korean people and the Chinese people fighting against Japan together during the Anti-Japanese War. When American imperialism is again invading the Korean brothers who have just been freed from the rule of the Japanese invaders, it is meaningful to recall these historical facts. We care about the liberation of our Korean brothers, and at the same time, we wish Comrade Chen Guohua to lead his own people to continue the unyielding struggle against the common enemy of the Chinese and Korean people—American imperialism—with the tenacious and heroic spirit of the Anti-Japanese War. We assure Comrade Chen Guohua and all Korean brothers that your old comrades-in-arms in China and all the Chinese people firmly support your struggle.
　　Fight bravely, Korean brothers, you are not alone.
　　Note 1: "North China Reclamation" was a rice paddy established by the Japanese invaders for wartime production. This refers to the Baigezhuang Rice Farm south of the Beining Railway in Tangshan Prefecture, with more than 40,000 mu of rice paddies. Chinese and Korean farmers, 3,000 households each, cultivated here for the Japanese invaders.
　　Note 2: "Section" is the division of rice paddies by the Japanese invaders, such as the one cultivated by Korean rice farmers is called "Korean Section", and the one cultivated by Chinese rice farmers is called "Chinese Section". But Chinese rice farmers were not allowed to go to the "Korean Section", but Korean rice farmers were allowed to go to the "Chinese Section" at will. This was the Japanese invaders' deliberate creation of contradictions between the Chinese and Korean people.

　　忆朝鲜抗日战友—陈国华同志
    史向荣
    一九四三年的夏天，我听说有一个朝鲜同志来到我家乡附近的一个村里，我就怀着奇异的心情去看他。我看到他时他正坐在炕上，一支手枪放在他的身旁。经过简单介绍，我才知道他就是早已听说的那个朝鲜同志陈国华。当我问他为什么也参加抗日时，他就坚决的表示：“日本鬼子是中国人民的敌人，也是朝鲜人民的敌人；打败了鬼子，解放了中国，也就解放了朝鲜……”他那流利的中国话，坚毅勇敢的气魄，使得我只有同情，赞佩。由这次谈话，我并知道了他参加革命已有七年之久，他在“七七”抗战前就已到延安参加了八路军（即现在的人民解放军），后来深入敌后，转战各地。因为我们家乡那里有日寇设立的“华北垦业”稻田，（注一）耕种稻田的农民中有被日寇强迫“移”来的三千余户朝鲜稻农，陈国华同志的主要任务，就是领导朝鲜农民的抗日斗争。那次晤谈使我无形中大大的提高了国际主义的和爱国主义的思想，使我感到我们的抗日战争，不但在本国人民中不是孤立的，而且在国际上也不是孤立的。同时，由于日寇的侵略，把中朝两国人民的感情和对日寇的仇恨融合起来了。
    不久，陈国华同志的名字，很快的就传遍了那一带地方。老乡们都以好奇的心情到处谈论着：“朝鲜人也和我们一起抗日了！”这也成了同志们互相鼓励和激励老乡们抗日热情的武器。陈国华同志每到一个地方，必被老乡们围起来，要求他在群众大会上讲话，把日寇虐待朝鲜人民的情形介绍给每一个中国人。记得有一次，在暗牛淀（唐山专区滦南县）的群众大会上，他谈到日寇灭亡了朝鲜以后的非人生活时。他哽咽着说不出话来了，听的群众也跟着流起泪来。他经常爱说：“中国人心不死，朝鲜人心不死。”这些话也深深地印在了那一带老乡们的脑子里，并且把他当作抗日斗争的名言了。
    日寇为了便于统治，便想办法在各民族间制造矛盾，对中朝人民也不例外。那时在柏各庄“华北垦业”给日寇种稻田的还有三千余户中国农民，日寇为了给中朝两族间制造矛盾，待遇上处处不一致。如不许中国稻民走进朝鲜人“段”（注二）上，出稻田时朝鲜人随便，而对中国人却施以严格的检查；同样给日寇耕种稻田，割下稻子以后，朝鲜稻民可以留下来一年吃的稻米，对中国稻民，却规定只发给豆饼和高粱。虽然是在割稻子的时候，如果偷吃一粒稻米也是“犯罪”！日寇企图用这样来抬高朝鲜稻民的身份，好替它监视中国农民，便于它对中朝两国人民的统治。
    但日寇这个计划后来完全破产了。陈国华同志，自到这里工作以后，很快就深入到日寇统治极严密的稻田地里，首先在朝鲜稻民中间打下了基础。在春天撒种时，他领导稻民故意不撒或少撒，把日寇发给当肥料的肥田粉拿出来或抛到水沟里……，想尽办法使稻田荒芜，使稻秧减产，到秋收时又想办法在地下践踏，打稻时少打等等方式对付日寇。日寇曾发给中朝稻民每户一头或两头耕牛，陈国华同志便领导着展开“拉”牛运动，开始时他教给稻民们利用晚上把牛牵出去，然后报告日寇说是“八路军拉去”。后来引起了日寇的怀疑，陈国华同志便亲自组织附近的民兵，利用晚间去“拉”，记得有一次，一个夜晚就牵出来了三十一头。
    陈国华同志不懂领导着中朝稻民在稻田内进行斗争，而且逐渐地把不愿继续供日寇驱使的朝鲜稻民武装成为一支“朝鲜人民抗日义勇军”。陈国华同志就领导着这支“义勇军”活动在北宁路南沿海稻田一带。他们有时分散化装潜入到柏各庄街里或稻田里袭击日寇，捕捉汉奸，有时则和中国人民当地游击队，并肩作战，共同打击日寇。到一九四五年夏天，我再见到他时，他带的这支“朝鲜人民抗日义勇军”已经扩大成一支二百多人的队伍了。
    这就是在抗日战争时朝鲜人民和中国人民一道抗日的史实之一。当美帝国主义又侵略到刚摆脱日寇统治不久的朝鲜兄弟头上之时，回忆这些史实是有意义的。我们关心朝鲜兄弟的解放，同时遥祝陈国华同志以抗日时期的顽强英勇的精神，领导着本国人民对中朝两国人民的死敌——美帝国主义继续进行不屈的斗争。我们向陈国华同志和一切朝鲜兄弟保证，你们在中国的老战友和全中国人民是坚决支持你们这种斗争的。
    勇敢的斗争吧，朝鲜兄弟们，你们不是孤立的。
    注一：“华北垦业”是日寇为战时生产设立的稻田。这里是指唐山专区北宁路南柏各庄稻场，有稻田四万余亩，中朝两国农民各三千余户在这里为日寇垦种。
    注二：“段”是日寇对稻田的划分，如归朝鲜稻民种的叫做“朝鲜段”，归中国稻民种的叫做“中国段”。但不许中国稻民到“朝鲜段”，却许朝鲜稻民随便到“中国段”，这是日寇故意在中朝两族人民间制造矛盾。
