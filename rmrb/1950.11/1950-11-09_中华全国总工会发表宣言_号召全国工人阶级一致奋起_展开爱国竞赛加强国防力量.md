Xinhua News Agency, November 6th: The All-China Federation of Trade Unions has issued a declaration calling on the national working class to launch a movement to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend our country. The full text of the declaration is as follows:

The democratic parties, headed by the Chinese Communist Party, in order to support the just demands of the people of the whole country, and to support the mass movement of the people of the whole country to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend our country on a voluntary basis, issued a joint declaration on the 4th. This declaration represents the will of the people of the whole country one hundred percent. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions, representing the national working class, expresses its unconditional and warm support for this joint declaration, and calls on the national working class to launch a great movement to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend our country on a voluntary basis.

Resisting America, aiding Korea, protecting our homes, and defending our country is the sacred task of the Chinese working class at present, because "the purpose of the American imperialists in invading Korea is not mainly for Korea itself, but to invade China, as the Japanese imperialists did in the past. Historical facts have long told us that the survival of Korea is closely related to the safety of China." Therefore, resisting America and aiding Korea is to protect our homes and defend our country, and to protect our homes and defend our country, we must resist America and aid Korea.

Now the flames of the war of aggression against Korea ignited by the American imperialists have already burned to the gate of our country, and our Taiwan has been occupied by the American imperialists. Without everyone's efforts, without fearless struggle, the enemy's ambition to invade China will not die. In order to eliminate the threat of the American imperialists' aggressive military force to the security of our country, in order to protect the fruits of the revolutionary victory we have already achieved, we must contribute all our labor and wisdom to the sacred cause of resisting America, aiding Korea, protecting our homes, and defending our country!

We call on the broad masses of workers across the country to unite, launch a patriotic competition movement, and fight to increase production and strengthen national defense! Railway workers! Rise up in response to the call of labor model Comrade Li Yong, launch an over-axle movement, and ensure the completion of transportation tasks. Machine workers! Rise up in response to the call of labor model Comrade Zhao Guoyou, launch a workshop competition movement, and ensure the production of more and better machines for the country. Coal miners! Rise up in response to the call of labor model Comrade Zhang Zifu, complete production tasks ahead of schedule, and produce more coal for the country. Ordnance workers! Rise up, work hard to learn technology, improve quality, and produce better and more weapons, so that the heroic People's Liberation Army defending the motherland has sufficient arms and ammunition. Seamen! Rise up and launch a shipping competition movement to increase loading capacity, shorten voyage times, and improve shipping efficiency, in order to ensure the completion of the national transportation plan. Postal and telecommunications workers! Rise up and launch a competition to improve efficiency and eliminate errors, in order to ensure the smooth flow of national communications. Medical workers! Rise up and organize volunteer medical teams to resist America and aid Korea, to serve the Korean military and civilians who are fighting against the American imperialist aggressors! All working people, unite and wage a resolute struggle to resist our most ferocious enemy, the American imperialist bandits, and to defend the motherland!

The All-China Federation of Trade Unions firmly believes that the Chinese working class, with a glorious tradition of struggle and long-tested by struggle, will certainly play a pioneering role in the patriotic movement of the people of the whole country to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend our country, and complete this sacred historical task!

　　中华全国总工会发表宣言
    号召全国工人阶级一致奋起
    展开爱国竞赛加强国防力量
    【新华社六日讯】中华全国总工会发表宣言，号召全国工人阶级展开抗美援朝保家卫国运动。宣言全文如下：
    以中国共产党为首的各民主党派，为了拥护全国人民的正义要求，为了支持全国人民在志愿基础上展开的抗美援朝保家卫国的群众运动，已于四日发表了一个联合宣言。这个宣言是百分之百地代表着全国人民的意志的。中华全国总工会代表全国工人阶级对于这个联合宣言表示无条件的热诚的拥护，并号召全国工人阶级，在志愿的基础上展开一个伟大的抗美援朝保家卫国的运动。
    抗美援朝保家卫国是中国工人阶级当前的神圣任务，因为“美帝国主义者侵略朝鲜的目的，主要地不是为了朝鲜本身，而是为要侵略中国，如像日本帝国主义者过去所做过的那样，历史的事实早已告诉我们，朝鲜的存亡与中国的安危是密切相关的”。所以抗美援朝即是为了保家卫国，要保家卫国，必须抗美援朝。
    现在美帝国主义所燃起的侵略朝鲜的战火，已经烧到了我们国境的大门，而且我们的台湾已被美帝国主义侵占了。没有大家的努力，没有奋不顾身的斗争，敌人侵略中国的野心是不会死的。为了消灭美帝国主义者的侵略武力对我们国境安全的威胁，为了保护我们已经获得的革命胜利的果实，我们就要把我们的劳动与智慧全部贡献于抗美援朝保家卫国的神圣事业！
    我们号召全国工人群众，一致起来，展开爱国竞赛运动，为提高生产加强国防力量而斗争！铁路工人们！起来响应劳动模范李永同志的号召，展开超轴运动，保证运输任务的完成。机器工人们，起来响应劳动模范赵国有同志的号召，展开车间竞赛运动，保证为国家生产更多更好的机器。煤矿工人们，起来响应劳动模范张子富同志的号召，提前完成生产任务，为国家生产更多的煤炭。兵工工人们，起来努力学习技术提高质量，生产更好更多的武器，使保卫祖国的英勇的人民解放军有充足的武装和弹药。海员工人们，起来开展增加载量、缩短航时、提高航运效率的航运竞赛运动，以保证国家运输计划的完成。邮电工人们，起来开展提高效率，消灭差错的竞赛，以保证国家的通讯联络畅通无阻。医务工作者们，起来组织抗美援朝志愿救护队，去为正在与美帝国主义侵略军进行搏斗的朝鲜军民服务！全体劳动群众们，大家团结起来，为抵抗我们的最凶恶的敌人，美帝国主义强盗，为保卫祖国，进行坚决的斗争！
    中华全国总工会深信有着光荣斗争传统而又久经斗争考验的中国工人阶级在全国人民抗美援朝保家卫国的爱国运动中，一定能起先锋带头的作用，去完成这个神圣的历史任务！
          中华全国总工会  十一月六日
