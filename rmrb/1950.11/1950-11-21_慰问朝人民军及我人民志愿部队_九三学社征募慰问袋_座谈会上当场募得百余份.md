　　Sending Regards to the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army
    The China Society of Science and Technology Solicits Comfort Bags
    More Than One Hundred Copies Were Raised on the Spot at the Symposium
    [Our Newspaper's News] The China Society of Science and Technology convened a general meeting of its members on the evening of November 18 to solicit comfort bags to send regards to the heroic Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army who are resisting American imperialism. Chairman Xu Deheng reported the significance of the meeting, and more than one hundred comfort bags were raised on the spot. Immediately following this, discussions were launched on the Resist-America, Aid-Korea movement. Speakers included Jin Tao, Chen Yada, Hu Ming, Hu Yun, Chen Mingshao, Wang Xinzheng, Huang Juefei, Lao Junzhan, Wang Yuquan, Hu Xianpu, Meng Xianzhang, Tang Zaozhen, Ye Dingyi, Xue Yu, Li Jinxi, Huang Guozhang, Tang Yawei, Sun Sunquan and more than thirty others. The speakers pointed out that with the participation of the Chinese Volunteer Army, the Korean People's Army has once again dealt a serious blow to the American imperialist aggressor army, exposing the outwardly strong but inwardly weak nature of American imperialism, deepening the contradictions within the imperialist camp, and inspiring the Eastern nations striving for independence and liberation. The speakers also pointed out that although American imperialism has been hit, it is still actively plotting to expand its aggression, and we should be vigilant. Regarding the activities of American-Chiang Kai-shek's special agents and spies, we must especially strengthen our vigilance and intensify our confidentiality work. In the Resist-America, Aid-Korea movement, propaganda is an important task, and members of the China Society of Science and Technology mostly serve in the cultural and educational circles, and should strengthen their efforts in this area.
