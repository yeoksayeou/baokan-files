　　To Oppose American Imperialism is to Commemorate the October Revolution
　　Cao Jinghua
　　The Red October, this great festival of all mankind, a symbol of the freedom and happiness of all mankind, its thirty-third anniversary has arrived. The aggressive bloc headed by American imperialism sees the Soviet Union, led by Marshal Stalin, constructing hydroelectric power stations with heroic spirit, excavating great canals, and carrying out great feats of transforming nature; sees the New China led by the wise leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, steadily moving towards the road of prosperity in all aspects; sees the improvement of the people's lives and the achievements of peaceful construction in the various new democratic countries; sees the surging power of the world's working people who support peace and oppose war growing day by day. The American imperialist warmongers feel that they are increasingly approaching the grave, so they frantically clamor, attempting to expand the war of aggression against Korea to the whole world. But today, the political consciousness of the world's working people has been unprecedentedly raised, and the determination to fight for peace has been unprecedentedly strengthened. The arrogant attempt of American imperialism is actually digging its own grave! Compatriots across the country, peace-loving people all over the world, today, when American imperialism, which is playing with war, threatens the security of all mankind, must rise up in unison, closely unite around the world's peace fortress - the Soviet Union, for their own safety, for their own freedom and happiness, resolutely defend peace, stop the spread of the American imperialist war of aggression against Korea, force the American imperialists to withdraw their armed forces of aggression against Korea, and crush the conspiracy of American imperialism to launch war. Follow the Soviet Union, and use strong actions to defend peace to commemorate this year's October Revolution anniversary. Peace-loving people all over the world, firmly remember the fighting call of the great anti-fascist warrior Gorky: "If the enemy does not surrender, then eliminate him!"

　　反对美帝，就是纪念红十月
    曹靖华
    红色的十月，这全人类伟大的节日，全人类自由幸福的象征，它的三十三周年纪念来到了。以美帝为首的侵略集团看到斯大林大元帅领导的苏联，以英雄的气概建设水电站，开凿大运河，改造大自然的伟大壮举；看到中国人民的英明领袖毛主席领导的新中国，在各方面稳步地走向强盛的道路；看到各新民主主义国家人民生活的改善以及和平建设的成就；看到全世界劳动人民的拥护和平，反对战争的排山倒海的力量日益高涨；美帝战争贩子感到自己愈益迫近坟墓了，于是疯狂的叫嚣，妄图把侵朝战火扩大到全世界。可是今天全世界劳动人民的政治觉悟已经空前提高了，为和平而斗争的决心空前加强了。美帝的狂妄企图，实是自掘坟墓！全国同胞，全世界爱好和平的人民，在今天，在玩弄战火的美帝威胁到全人类的安全时，一致奋起，紧紧地团集到世界和平堡垒——苏联的周围，为着自身的安全，为着自身的自由与幸福，坚决地捍卫和平，制止美帝侵朝战火的延烧，迫使美帝撤退侵朝武力，粉碎美帝挑战阴谋，跟着苏联走，用坚强的保卫和平的行动，来纪念今年的十月革命纪念节。全世界爱好和平的人民，牢牢的记着反法西斯的伟大战士高尔基的战斗的号召：“如果敌人不投降，就消灭他！”
