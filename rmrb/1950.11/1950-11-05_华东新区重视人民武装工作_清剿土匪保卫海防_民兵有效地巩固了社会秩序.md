Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 1st: Hundreds of thousands of militiamen and self-defense team members in the new districts of East China's coastal areas, including Southern Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Fujian, have begun to become an important force in assisting the People's Liberation Army in suppressing bandits, defending the coast, and consolidating social order.

Since the liberation of the entire mainland of East China last year, after peasants in various regions, with the support of the People's Liberation Army and under the leadership of the People's Government, initially achieved victory in the struggle to reduce rent and oppose local bullies, they immediately participated in the militia and self-defense teams to cooperate with the PLA in suppressing the remaining bandits and counter-revolutionaries. From April to September, militiamen in Gutian County, Fujian Province, fought more than 350 battles, annihilating 489 bandits. Militiamen in Bisheng Township, Wenling County, Zhejiang Province, repelled sea bandits attempting to land five times. Militiamen in Dajing District, Yueqing County, also assisted coastal defense troops in completely annihilating the Dong Long bandit gang of the "Independent 7th Column 4th District Command of the Ministry of National Defense," which had infiltrated the mainland. In many areas, militia and self-defense teams organized joint defense between districts, townships, and villages, achieving "one village sounds the alarm, all villages respond, everyone takes action." Five cadres from the work team in Anfeng Township, Fuqing County, Fujian Province, were once kidnapped by bandits. Chen Mingfa, the director of the township farmers' association, led the township militia in a brave pursuit, rescued the work cadres, and captured 11 bandits. Militiamen in various areas organized patrol teams to protect production. Militiamen in coastal areas also organized fishing protection teams to protect fishermen going out to sea to fish. In addition, militia and self-defense team members in various regions have also played a significant role in struggles such as rent reduction, investigating black land, and opposing land withdrawal.

The People's Governments and military organs in the new districts of East China all attach importance to the construction of people's armed forces. Military sub-districts, counties, and districts have convened meetings of militia cadres. Some areas in Zhejiang have already established people's armed forces cadre schools to train activists among the militia. Some areas in Southern Jiangsu have recently held militia grand reviews one after another. People's Armed Forces Committees have been established in various counties and districts in Fujian to strengthen leadership over militia work.

　　华东新区重视人民武装工作
    清剿土匪保卫海防
    民兵有效地巩固了社会秩序
    【新华社南京一日电】华东沿海苏南、浙江、福建等地新区的数十万民兵和自卫队员，已开始成为协助人民解放军清剿土匪、保卫海防、巩固社会秩序的重要力量。
    自去年华东大陆全境解放，各地农民在人民解放军的支持和人民政府的领导下，初步获得了减租和反恶霸斗争的胜利后，随即参加民兵和自卫队，配合解放军清剿残余土匪和镇压反革命分子的活动。福建古田县民兵自四月至九月共作战三百五十多次，歼灭土匪四百八十九名。浙江温岭县必胜乡民兵曾五次击退妄图登陆的海匪。乐清县大荆区民兵也协助海防部队将潜入大陆的匪“国防部独立第七纵队第四地区指挥部”董龙匪股全部歼灭。许多地区民兵和自卫队在区、乡、村之间组织了联防，做到“一村枪响，村村呼应，个个动手”。福建福清县安峰乡工作组的五个干部曾被土匪劫走，该乡农会主任陈明发率领全乡民兵奋勇追赶，救下工作干部，并俘匪十一名。各地民兵组织了巡逻队，保卫生产。沿海地区的民兵也组织了护渔队，保护渔民下海捕鱼。此外，各地民兵和自卫队员在减租、查黑田、反抽田等斗争中也都起了很大作用。
    华东新区人民政府和军事机关都重视建设人民武装工作。各军分区、县、区曾召开了民兵干部会议。浙江某些地区已开办人民武装干部学校、训练民兵中的积极分子。苏南某些地区最近先后举行了民兵大检阅。福建各县、区普遍成立了人民武装委员会，以加强对民兵工作的领导。
