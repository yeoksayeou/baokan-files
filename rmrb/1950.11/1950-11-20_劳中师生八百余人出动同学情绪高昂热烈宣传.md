　　[Report from this newspaper] Labor Middle School, after summarizing the experiences of the street propaganda on November 13th, conducted a second propaganda campaign on the morning of November 19th.

　　More than 800 teachers and students from the entire school were divided into three major teams, and conducted propaganda continuously for more than five hours in fourteen locations, with approximately more than 5,000 listeners.

　　The students were in high spirits. The second team did not return to school until after 6 o'clock.

　　The audience consisted mostly of working people. The most popular forms of propaganda among the masses were street plays and living newspaper dramas. Many people followed closely behind the teams for as long as three hours. Cartoons were also relatively popular. When the atrocities of the American imperialists in Korea were mentioned, many workers sighed and clenched their fists.

　　The school is now preparing a cartoon exhibition to be open to the public.

　　劳中师生八百余人出动同学情绪高昂热烈宣传
    【本报讯】劳动中学总结了十一月十三日街头宣传的经验后，于十一月十九日上午又做了第二次宣传。
    全校师生八百余人分为三大队，在十四个地方，五个多钟头，连续作了宣传，听讲观众约有五千多人。
    同学们的情绪很高。第二大队一直到六点多才回校。
    听众方面以劳动人民最多，宣传方式最受群众欢迎的，是街头剧和活报剧。有很多人紧紧地跟在队后一直有三小时。漫画也是比较受到欢迎的。当讲到美帝在朝鲜的暴行时，许多工人都叹着气，握紧了拳头。
    现在该校正在筹备一个漫画展览会，准备公开展览。
