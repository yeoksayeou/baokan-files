　　From the Old Files of the Puppet Police Bureau: Atrocities of American Soldiers in Shanghai
    Weis
    The movement to resist America and aid Korea has begun! Across the land of China, a raging fire of anger against American imperialist aggression has been ignited. Those with grievances are airing them, and those with scores to settle are settling them. The people of Shanghai also have countless bloody debts to settle with American imperialism.

    After the Japanese devils surrendered, American soldiers, sailors, and airmen swarmed into Shanghai, becoming the de facto occupiers. From then on, although the people of Shanghai had ended the disaster of Japanese invaders, they were invaded by new aggressors. Their atrocities unfolded one after another.

    Here, based on a portion of the files of the puppet police bureau preserved by the Shanghai Public Security Bureau, we will denounce the atrocities of the American imperialist aggressors in Shanghai.

            The “Freedom” to Kill

    On October 8, 1945, at 7:00 PM, near Hengchan Company on Gongrong Road, an American soldier shot and killed an unknown Chinese worker. The deceased was approximately forty years old, name unknown. The puppet police bureau sent personnel to investigate, and the American officer "Ke'er" contemptuously said: We did shoot and kill a Chinese person, but he was a thief. According to this logic, they could kill any Chinese person simply by using the name "thief." Of course, the murderer got away with it because the American officer didn't even allow the puppet police to ask the suspect's name.

    On August 27, 1947, at 11:00 PM, Xu Jinfu, a boatman who made a living rowing sampans in the Huangpu River, was shot and killed by American sailor F. Armer for no reason. Before his death, Xu Jinfu was employed by the Puppet Material Supply Bureau's Landing Craft No. 1060, specializing in ferrying people, and stayed overnight on the deck of the craft. That evening, he was watching a movie shown on Landing Craft No. 514 of the American Navy on the deck of No. 1060 when he was killed by a bullet fired from that ship. The puppet police investigated afterward, and the American soldiers bit him again, saying that Xu Jinfu wanted to steal Coca-Cola from the bucket full of lead on the ship. According to this reason, Xu Jinfu deserved to be killed by the American soldiers.

            The “Freedom” to Assault

    On the night of November 3, 1946, at 9:00 PM, Song Qirun, a police officer No. 2691 from the New City Branch of the puppet police bureau, was directing a rickshaw violating traffic regulations at his traffic post, advising the rickshaw puller to take a detour. However, two American sailors sitting in the rickshaw refused to listen to the advice, got out of the rickshaw, and started punching him. After hitting him, they continued to drive away. Officer Song followed to stop them, and the American sailors got out of the rickshaw and beat him again. Officer Song fired his gun for help. At this time, the puppet police patrol did not arrive, but more and more American soldiers gathered, with more than twenty people participating in the assault. Officer Song suffered severe injuries as a result, his ears and nose were swollen, and his mouth was bleeding. While in a dazed state, Song fired his gun in self-defense, but unfortunately, he didn't kill any American devils. Afterward, the American soldiers fled, and of course, they would not be punished in any way.

    Late in the evening of October 5, 1946, two American sailors riding in Zheng Yuguang's rickshaw sped along Yunnan Road. At the intersection of Guangdong Road, the American devils ordered the rickshaw to stop, fired three shots at the traffic light, and then ordered the rickshaw to speed away. Upon reaching Dagu Road, they saw prostitutes, got out of the rickshaw, and overturned Zheng Yuguang's rickshaw handle.

    On October 17, 1946, at 9:00 PM, an American sailor riding a rickshaw sped along Nanjing East Road. A group of peddlers followed the rickshaw. When they arrived at the entrance of the Huizhong Hotel, the American sailor got out of the rickshaw and beat the peddlers. The peddlers scattered, and an innocent Shanghai resident, Yao Yuyi, was severely beaten here, and his incisors were knocked out. The American soldier then swaggered away.

    On the morning of October 23, 1946, in front of the Siekehai Bar on the Old Father Jin Road, the carrying pole of Pei Shigong's rickshaw was broken by an American airman. The rude American soldier jumped into a car and drove away. Another rickshaw worker, Zhang Deming, who saw what happened and acted bravely, jumped onto the car's running board to reason with him. The shameless American soldier pushed Zhang violently off the car while the car was speeding. Zhang Deming was seriously injured as a result.

    On November 5, 1946, at 11:00 PM, a Route 8 tram was traveling along Zhongshan East 1st Road, passing the intersection of Fuzhou Road. An American soldier came rushing over with a leather belt and injured passenger Wang Changfa's eye, then attempted to whip the driver. Afterward, the American military police took the injured person and the offending American soldier away. The puppet police bureau reported this and sent personnel to the American military office at No. 2 Beijing Road to negotiate. The American soldier on duty roared at them. The puppet police at the time wrote a report with sobs: "The officer looked unkind and was rude. Not only did he not tell the details of the situation, but he also slammed the table and threatened loudly: Don't interfere with this matter, I will draft a document and report to Nanjing."

    On October 27, 1946, at 8:00 PM, a rickshaw carrying two American sailors drove north from Maoming Road. The American soldiers could not speak Chinese and simply pointed the direction with their hands. When they arrived at Dagu Road, the rickshaw worker, Tang Fugao, could no longer accept the blind directions of the two American soldiers and had to stop the rickshaw. The American soldiers were furious, grabbed a wooden stick from a truck on the side of the road, and struck Tang Fugao's head violently, knocking him unconscious. This blatant act of violence aroused the anger of the Chinese people on the side of the road. A citizen, Zhou Zhigao, shouted, "American soldiers are killing people!" When the two American soldiers saw this tense situation, they ran away, and passersby chased after them upon hearing the sound. However, the American soldiers were later released by the puppet police bureau, and Tang Fugao's beating became another unsolved case.

            The “Freedom” to Steal and Rob

    On November 28, 1945, at 1:50 AM, the Tilanqiao branch received a report that American sailors were blocking rickshaws and robbing them in groups on Dongbailao Road, Fair Road, and near Huishan Road. Two rickshaw pullers and one pedestrian were robbed of two million puppet legal tender, and the American soldiers fled towards the Fair Road wharf afterward without a trace.

    On October 23, 1945, at 2:00 AM, two American soldiers suddenly broke into the bedroom on the seventh floor of No. 41 Jinling East Road. After entering, they first choked the resident Wang Nengyou's neck, then opened the desk and snatched 5,300 puppet currency. Yu Shicheng from the next room came to check, but was also threatened by the American soldiers. A drunken American soldier even mistook Yu for a woman and insulted him. The American soldiers then calmly escaped. The clerk of the puppet police bureau shamelessly wrote: "This case is purely an accidental event and does not symbolize planned robbery. This matter concerns the atrocities of friendly forces, and the investigation process will be reported."

    On April 24, 1946, at 3:00 PM, American sailor Tai Ya went to Dachang Jewelry Store at No. 598 Old Xiafei Road and snatched three diamond rings. The store's accounting room immediately reported to the puppet police No. 4950, who immediately tracked him down. The American robber then sneaked into Hehefang on Changle Road and openly opened fire to resist arrest. This time, it was somewhat gratifying. The robber was shot and killed by the police in self-defense.

    On November 16, 1945, at 6:00 PM, the Shunfeng brand car of the Fourth Ground Service Squadron of the Second Regional Command of Chiang Kai-shek's Air Force, along with a driver, was also robbed by American soldiers. Upon reaching Yulin Road, the American soldiers threw the Chiang Kai-shek driver out of the car and sped away without a trace.

            The “Freedom” to Be Arrogant and Domineering

    American soldiers were the actual authorities in Shanghai. The shameless Chiang Kai-shek gang never dared to disobey orders in front of the American bandits. Here is a document that shows how the American bandits cruelly destroyed the residential freedom of the Chinese people and the ugly state of the Chiang Kai-shek lackeys obeying orders: "Shanghai Municipal Government Police Bureau Director Xuan's Inspection: Approving the Third Front Army Commander Tang Siling's Shen Yanchen to forward the telegram from the American Naval Commander in China, Ka Youlan, on the 28th, stating: Since the Japanese Yushang Qiaxia Wharf and Old Nanbo Wharf have been designated as American naval work bases, the unloading of valuable equipment and military supplies is now beginning, and all civilians residing in the area should be moved out immediately to facilitate military affairs, etc., forwarded by telegram, hoping that your bureau will send personnel to work with the local Baojia to order the civilians in the area to move out, and report the handling situation. Qian Dajun handed over" - This is truly a shameless act of treason by the Chiang Kai-shek gang! Listen to the voices of the civilians who have lived here for more than twenty years: "...I hope you will observe the plight of the common people who are in a dilemma of advance and retreat, and negotiate on their behalf to preserve their residence, then the entire family, old and young, will be endlessly grateful." But this voice can never move the hearts of the bandits.

    These are pages of history written in blood and tears! These are records of atrocities! If it were not for the valiant advance of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the liberation of Shanghai, the blood and tears of the Shanghai people would probably still be flowing endlessly today.

    Today, the people of Shanghai have stood up! We must deeply remember the hatred of the American and Chiang Kai-shek bandits!

    Defend our country, and turn endless hatred into strength! If the American imperialists dare to launch aggression, the people of Shanghai will stand on the front lines of the battle, use all their strength to beat the American imperialists into the sea, and settle the old scores with them.

　　从伪警局旧档案看美兵在上海的暴行
    伟斯
    抗美援朝的运动起来了！全中国的土地上到处燃起了反对美帝侵略的万丈怒焰。有冤伸冤，有仇报仇。——上海人民也有着数不清的血海深仇要向美帝清算。
    日寇投降后，美国鬼子的陆海空军冲进了上海，成了实际的占领者。从此，上海人民虽然结束了日本强盗侵略的灾祸，但是却闯进了新的侵略者。他们的暴行又一幕幕地演出了。
    这里我们根据上海公安局所保存伪警局的一部分档案，来控诉美帝侵略者在上海的暴行。
            有杀人的“自由”
    一九四五年十月八日下午七时，在共荣路恒产公司附近，一个美兵开枪杀死了一个无名华工。死者年约四十余岁，姓名不详。伪警局派员去调查，美国军官“可儿”轻蔑地说：我们确实开枪打死了一个中国人，不过他是小偷。根据这个逻辑，只要用个“小偷”的名字，他们就可以杀死任何中国人民。——这件案子，杀人犯当然逍遥法外，因为美国军官连凶手的名字也不准伪警询问。
    一九四七年八月二十七日下午十一时，在黄浦江中摇舢舨为业的船户徐金福，被美国水兵F·Armer无故击毙。徐金福生前受雇于伪物资供应局一○六○号登陆艇，专司摆渡，晚间就宿在该艇甲板。这一晚，他在一○六○号甲板上观看美海军五一四号登陆艇所放映的电影，就被该舰飞来一弹打死。伪警事后调查，美国兵又咬他一口，说徐金福想偷窃该舰的装满铅桶中的可口可乐。——根据这种理由，徐金福就该被美兵杀死了。
            有行凶的“自由”
    一九四六年十一月三日夜间九时，伪警局新成分局二六九一号警士宋其润，因为在交通岗位上指挥一辆违警的三轮车，劝车夫绕道而行。但是坐在车上的两个美国水兵，不服劝导，下车挥拳就打，打后继续驱车前行。宋警乃跟踪阻止，美国水兵又下车殴打，宋警就鸣警求援。这时伪警的巡逻没有来，美国兵却愈聚愈多，竟有二十多人参加行凶，宋警因此受创甚剧，耳鼻肿胀，口齿流血，宋在神志昏迷间，乃开枪自卫，可惜没有把美国鬼子打死几个。事后，美兵逃之夭夭，当然不会受到任何惩罚。
    一九四六年十月五日深晚，有两个美国水兵乘坐郑裕光的三轮车，在云南路疾驶。到广东路口，美国鬼子喝令停车，向红绿灯连开三枪，又令疾驶而去，到大沽路，见有妓女即下车，并将郑裕光的三轮车把推翻。
    一九四六年十月十七日下午九时，一个美国水兵乘坐三轮车在南京东路疾驶。车后跟着一群小贩，到了汇中饭店门口，美国水兵下车来殴打小贩，小贩逃散了，一个无辜的上海人姚毓义就在这里被狠狠的打了一顿，门齿也被打掉，美兵则扬长而去。
    一九四六年十月二十三日清晨，在旧金神父路锡而克海酒吧门口，裴世公的人力车杠，被一个美国空军踏断。强蛮的美军跳上一辆汽车开走了，另一个见义勇为的三轮车工友张德明，跳上了汽车踏板向他论理。无耻的美国军人就在车子疾驶中间，把张猛推下车。张德明因此受了重伤。
    一九四六年十一月五日下午十一时，一辆八路电车从中山东一路驶经福州路口，一名美国陆军拿着皮带狠狠的赶来，将乘客王长发的眼部打伤，随后又企图抽打司机。事后美国陆军宪兵队把伤者及肇祸美军带走了。伪警局据报就派员到北京路二号美军办事处去交涉，值日美军却对他们大肆咆哮。当时的伪警这样呜咽地写着报告：“该军官神色不善，态度横蛮，非但不告诉经过情形，反而竟拍桌击台，高声恐吓：此事休管，吾当缮文报告南京。”
    一九四六年十月二十七日下午八时，一辆三轮车载着两个美国水兵由茂名路向北直驶，美国兵讲不来中国话，只是用手直指方向，到大通路，三轮车工友汤富高实在不能接受该两美国兵的盲目指挥，只好停车。美国兵大怒，顺手在路旁卡车上抽到一根木棍，就向汤富高头部猛烈一击，汤乃晕倒在地。这种公然行凶的暴行，激起了路旁中国人民的愤怒，市民周志高高呼“美国兵杀人了！”两美兵一看见这种紧张情形，拔脚溜走，路人都闻声追捕。但是后来美兵被伪警局放出，汤富高的被打，又成了不了了之的悬案。
            有盗劫财物的“自由”
    一九四五年十一月二十八日上午一时五十分，提篮桥分局得到报告，美国海军结队在东百老汇路、公平路、近汇山路一带，拦住三轮车抢劫。车夫二名，及行人一名被劫伪法币二百万元，美军事后向公平路码头逃逸无踪。
    一九四五年十月二十三日上午二时，金陵东路四十一号七楼卧室，突然闯进两个美兵，进入后先将住户王能友的头劲叉住，一面拉开写字台抢去伪币五千三百元。隔室俞士成来探视，亦遭美兵恐吓，一个烂醉如泥的美国兵，竟还把俞认作女性侮辱。美兵事后从容逃走。伪警局的承办员竟无耻地写道：“本案纯系偶发事件，并无谋劫财物象征。事关友军暴行，合将调查经过呈报。”
    一九四六年四月二十四日下午三时，美国水兵台亚，到旧霞飞路五九八号大昌首饰店，抢走钻戒三只，该店帐房随即报告伪警四九五○号，当即跟踪追捕。美国强盗后潜入长乐路和合坊，并公然开枪射击拒捕。这一次总算稍快人心，那强盗在警士还击下中弹身死。
    一九四五年十一月十六日下午六时，蒋匪空军第二地区司令部第四地勤中队的顺风牌汽车，连驾驶员一名也被美国兵劫走了，一到榆林路，美国兵就将蒋匪驾驶兵抛下车子，疾驶无踪。
            有强横霸道的“自由”
    美国兵是上海实际的当局，无耻的蒋匪帮在美匪面前是从来不敢抗命的。这里有一个文件，标明着美匪穷凶极恶的摧残着中国人民的居住自由，和蒋匪奴才的唯命是从的丑态。文如下：“上海市政府警察局长宣局长勋鉴：准第三方面军汤司令官申艳辰收代电转据美国驻华海军司令卡友兰二十八日函称：以日本裕生恰夏码头及老南博码头，经划为美国海军工作基地，刻正开始起卸贵重器械及军需品，所有居住该区之平民，应即迁出，以利军务等语，转电前来，即希贵局派员会同当地保甲，饬令该地平民迁出，并将办理情形见复为荷，钱大钧阳交”——这真是蒋匪帮无耻透顶的卖国行为！听听住在这里二十余年的平民的声音吧：“……尚望俯察小民处斯进退两难之苦衷，代为交涉，保留居住，则全体老少感激无涯矣。”但这声音是永远不能打动匪帮的心肠的。
    这是一页页的血泪史，这是一幕幕的暴行录！假如没有中国人民解放军的奋勇前进，解放上海，上海人民的血泪恐怕到今天还流不尽。
    今天上海人民站起来了！我们要深深的记得美蒋匪犯的仇恨！
    保卫我们的国家，把无穷的仇恨化为力量！假如美帝胆敢发动侵略，上海人民将会站在战斗的前线，用一切力量，把美帝打下海去，和它算一算旧帐。（转载上海新闻日报）
