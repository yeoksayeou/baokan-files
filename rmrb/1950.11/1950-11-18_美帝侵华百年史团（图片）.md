    History of American Imperialist Aggression Against China in the Last Century Group
    (I) Under the coercion of American imperialism, the Qing government signed the "Treaty of Wangxia" with the United States in 1844 (the 24th year of Daoguang), stipulating: "If other interests benefit other countries, the people of the United States shall enjoy the same benefits." It also unreasonably demanded that foreigners enjoy "extraterritoriality" in China. ·Li Binghong·
    (II) Amidst the revolutionary situation of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, the corrupt Qing government was on the verge of collapse. For its own interests, American aggressors found it necessary to support this traitorous government. In 1863, under the direction of the American consul in Shanghai, the American rogue Frederick Townsend Ward organized the "Ever Victorious Army" to participate in the war. After Ward was killed by the Taiping Army, the American Burgevine took command. ·Weng Yizhi·
    (III) In 1873 (the 12th year of Tongzhi), the American consul in Fujian, Le Gendre, went to Japan and incited the Japanese to invade Taiwan. American and Japanese combined naval and land forces attacked Taiwan. When the Japanese army in Taiwan suffered from the plague and the Qing government also planned to send troops to aid Taiwan, the Japanese army was discouraged. The United States immediately changed from a murderer to a "peacemaker," plotting to come forward to "mediate." ·Tao Mouji·
　  (IV) In 1884, the United States and Japan jointly advanced towards Korea, instigating the pro-Japanese and pro-American factions in Korea to coerce the Korean king to break away from China. In 1890 (the 16th year of Guangxu), the American Le Gendre (the same one who led troops to attack Taiwan in 1873) and others entered the Korean court (Korean Cabinet) and manipulated Korean internal affairs and economy. ·Zhang Wenyuan·
    (V) In the Sino-Japanese War of 1894 (the 20th year of Guangxu), American imperialism was a direct accomplice of Japan. It helped Japan on the one hand, and forced the Qing government to sign the shameful "Treaty of Shimonoseki" on the other, ceding Korea, Taiwan, the Penghu Islands, and the Liaodong Peninsula to Japan. ·Gu Bingxin·
    (VI) In 1897, Germany occupied Jiaozhou Bay, Japan occupied Fujian, Tsarist Russia occupied Lushun and Dalian, France occupied Guangzhou Bay, Britain demanded Weihaiwei, and Italy borrowed Sanmen Bay. The coastal areas of China were almost completely divided. How could American imperialism be willing to accept this situation? In 1899, the United States proposed "Open Door Policy" to share the rights of aggression against China. ·Han Shangyi·
    (VII) In 1900 (the 26th year of Guangxu), the Boxer Rebellion began. The United States participated in the Eight-Nation Alliance, massacred our people, and occupied Beijing. ·Ding Shen·
　　(VIII) In 1904, Japan and Tsarist Russia fought the Russo-Japanese War to compete for Northeast China. The United States aided Japan with 450 million US dollars, attempting to help Japan occupy Northeast China and then share the interests of Northeast China with Japan. ·Hong Huang·
    (IX) After the Xinhai Revolution, the United States continued to oppress Chinese revolutionary forces, support Yuan Shikai, the representative of the landlord-comprador class, and inherit the Qing government's corrupt rule over the Chinese people. It sent the American Goodnow as Yuan Shikai's advisor to support Yuan Shikai's attempt to become emperor. ·Yu Yunjie·
    (X) In 1915, Japan presented the Twenty-One Demands, which would have destroyed China as a nation. American imperialism completely sided with Japan, coercing Yuan Shikai to "make concessions." It shamelessly proposed: "Any clause in the negotiations that is recognized by the Chinese government and changes the status (interests) of foreigners in China, the United States government will also enjoy its benefits under the most-favored-nation treatment." It used Japan's demands on China to obtain the same benefits from the Chinese people. ·Zhenhua·
    (XI) In September 1917, Japanese Foreign Minister Ishii Kikujiro went to the United States and signed a secret agreement with U.S. Secretary of State Lansing, plotting to destroy China together. Japan guaranteed the "Open Door" privileges for the United States in China, while the United States guaranteed Japan's "special interests" in China and supported Japan's occupation of Jiaozhou Bay at the Paris Peace Conference. ·Shen Zicheng·
    (XII) Imperialists had mutual contradictions in their scramble for rights in China. These contradictions were manifested in the warlord wars (the running dogs of imperialism) within China. American imperialism directly controlled the Zhili clique warlords Cao Kun and Wu Peifu to launch the Zhili-Anhui War in 1920, and launched the Zhili-Fengtian Wars twice in 1922 and 1924, using the blood of the Chinese people to maintain their interests in China. ·Xu Fubao·
    (XIII) In May 1925, Japanese factory owners in Shanghai shot and killed the Chinese worker Gu Zhenghong, which triggered the vigorous May Thirtieth Movement of the Chinese people. The U.S. Marine Corps stationed in Shanghai participated in the British and Japanese army's massacre of unarmed Chinese masses. ·Zhao Hongben·
    (XIV) The Great Revolution began in 1926, and the revolutionary forces advanced northward. On March 24, 1927, American imperialism, together with British imperialism, bombarded Nanjing, creating the "Xiaguan Massacre," directly opposing the Chinese people's revolution and prompting Chiang Kai-shek's betrayal. ·Zhao Yannian·
　　(XV) With the rapid development of the revolutionary forces, the original puppets of imperialism in China were about to collapse. They had to buy new running dogs from the revolutionary ranks. The running dog that American imperialism sought in the revolutionary ranks was none other than the public enemy of the Chinese people, Chiang Kai-shek. American imperialism bribed Chiang Kai-shek with a large amount of US dollars through the Shanghai gangster boss, and Chiang Kai-shek gave the "April 12th" massacre of Communists as a gift for selling himself. ·Shen Tongheng·
    (XVI) The armed forces of the Chinese people have gradually grown stronger, which is a great force irreconcilable with imperialism. American imperialism hated the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army to the bone. It aided Chiang Kai-shek with a large amount of American dollars for "bandit suppression" expenses, helped Chiang Kai-shek establish an air force, and sent Americans to participate in Chiang's "military advisory group" to directly plan various "encirclements." ·Wu Yun·
    (XVII) In 1937, during the preparatory stage of the Japanese invasion of China, the United States supplied Japan with a large amount of war materials, accounting for more than half of all munitions used by Japan to launch the war. Until 1938, when the Chinese people suffered the most from the Japanese invaders' rape, killing and arson, American imperialism continued to export killing materials to Japan, accounting for 92% of Japan's total war materials consumption. ·Tu Ke·
    (XVIII) In December 1941, the Pacific War broke out. American imperialism used a large amount of materials to supply Chiang Kai-shek to encircle the "Democratic China" - the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Anti-Japanese Democratic Base Area, while sitting on Mount Emei with Chiang Kai-shek, watching the Chinese people fight the Japanese invaders. ·Shen Roujian·
    (XIX) On August 10, 1945, after the Japanese invaders surrendered, in the struggle between the Chinese people and Chiang Kai-shek, American imperialism sent Marshall to pretend to be a "mediator," but instigated Chiang Kai-shek to create obstacles in the negotiations, attempting to delay time. On the other hand, it used airplanes and warships to quickly transport 820,000 Chiang Kai-shek troops to the Northeast, North China, and Central China liberated areas to plunder the fruits of victory. ·Yu Baishu·
    (XX) After Japan surrendered, American imperialism immediately dispatched a large number of naval and land forces to station in our major cities. These beastly troops, in addition to raping our wives and daughters, killing our fathers and brothers, plundering our people's wealth, and burning our houses, even dared to enter our liberated areas to disrupt order on several occasions. ·Ye Miao·
    (XXI) In the three years since Japan surrendered, American imperialism supplied Chiang Kai-shek with a large number of killing weapons, with a total value of $5,103,498,223. ·Zhang Xiya·
    (XXII) In the three years since Japan surrendered, American imperialism obtained from Chiang Kai-shek the rights to China's airspace, territory, territorial waters, inland river navigation, railway management, military power, financial power, police power, judicial power, state secrets, agricultural rights, industrial and mining rights, commercial rights, customs rights, cultural and educational rights, "final decision-making power" in internal affairs, diplomatic command, and so on. ·Wang Qi·
    (XXIII) After our People's Liberation Army liberated the mainland, American imperialism still aided the remnants of Chiang Kai-shek's troops entrenched in Taiwan with various munitions, assisting Chiang Kai-shek in blockading our mainland ports. After February 6, 1950, American and Chiang Kai-shek's aircraft jointly bombed our mainland, destroying our economic construction. ·Maigan·
    (XXIV) In June 1950, American imperialism and the puppet Syngman Rhee unreasonably attacked the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. At the same time, it sent the Seventh Fleet to invade and occupy our Taiwan. ·Zhang Xuefu·

    美帝侵华百年史团
    （一）在美帝国主义威逼下，满清政府于一八四四年（道光二十四年）与美订定“望厦条约”，规定：“如另有利益及于各国，合众国人民应一体均沾”。并无理要求外人在华享有“治外法权”。·黎冰鸿·
    （二）在太平天国革命形势下，腐败的满清政府有崩溃可能，美侵略者为了自己利益，有扶持这一卖国政府的必要。一八六三年，在上海美领事指使下，美国流氓华尔组织“常胜军”参战。华尔被太平军杀后由美人白齐文统率。　·翁逸之·
    （三）一八七三年（同治十二年）美驻闽领事李仙得至日本，怂恿日人侵台，美日海陆联军进攻台湾。从日军在台患瘟疫，满清政府亦有出兵援台之拟，日军气馁，美即一变凶手为“和事佬”，阴谋出面“调处”。
    ·陶谋基·
　  （四）一八八四年美日协同向朝鲜进迫，唆使朝鲜亲日美派挟制韩王脱离中国。一八九○年（光绪十六年）美人李仙得（即一八七三年领兵攻台湾者）等进入韩廷（朝鲜内阁），操纵朝鲜内政与经济。
    ·张文元·
    （五）一八九四年（光绪二十年）甲午之战中，美帝是日本的直接帮凶者·它一面帮助日本，一面逼迫满清政府在可耻的“马关条约”上签字，割朝鲜、台湾、澎湖群岛及辽东半岛给日本。　·顾炳鑫·
    （六）一八九七年，德占我胶州湾，日占我福建，沙俄占我旅大，法占我广州湾，英索我威海卫，意借我三门湾，中国沿海地区几被分割已尽，对此形势，美帝何能甘心？一八九九年，美国提出“门户开放”，共沾侵华权利。　·韩尚义·
    （七）一九○○年（光绪廿六年）义和团战事开始，美国参加八国联军，屠杀我国人民，占据我北京城。　·丁深·
　　（八）一九○四年日本与沙俄争夺我东北而发生日俄战争。美国以四万万五千万美元援助日本，企图帮助日本占领我国东北后与日本平分我东北利益。　·洪荒·
    （九）辛亥革命后，美国继续压迫中国革命势力，支持地主买办阶级的代表人物袁世凯，继承满清政府对中国人民的腐败统治，派美人古德诺为袁世凯的顾问，支持袁世凯称帝。　·俞云阶·
    （十）一九一五年日本向我提出亡国灭种的二十一条约，美帝完全站在日方，威逼袁世凯“相忍相让”。并无耻地提出：“交涉中的条约，其中任何条款经中国政府承认，而对在华外人之地位有所变更（利益）者，在最惠国待遇之下美国政府亦将享有其利益”。它利用日本对华要求，从中国人民身上取得了相同的利益。　·振华·
    （十一）一九一七年九月，日前外祖石井菊次郎赴美，与美国务卿蓝辛签订秘约，图谋合力亡华。日本保证美在华的“门户开放”特权，美则保证日在华“特殊利益”，并在巴黎和会上支持日本占我胶州湾。
    ·沈子丞·
    （十二）帝国主义者在争夺中国权利中发生了相互矛盾，这些矛盾表现在中国国内军阀（帝国主义的走狗）的混战中。美帝直接掌握直系军阀曹锟、吴佩孚等于一九二○年发动直皖战争，一九二二年和一九二四年二次发动直奉战争。以中国人民的鲜血来保持他们在华的利益。　·徐甫堡·

    （十四）一九二六年大革命开始，革命势力向北推进，一九二七年三月二十四日美帝联合英帝，炮轰南京，制造“下关惨案”，直接反对中国人民革命，并促成蒋介石叛变。　·赵延年·
　　（十五）革命势力迅速发展，帝国主义在华原有的傀儡势将崩溃，他们必须重新在革命队伍中收买新的走狗。美帝国主义在革命队伍中所物色的走狗不是别人，即是中国人民的公敌蒋介石，美帝通过上海流氓头子以大量美元收买蒋介石，而蒋介石则以“四·一二”屠杀共产党人作为卖身的见面礼。　·沈同衡·
    （十六）中国人民的武装逐渐壮大起来，这是与帝国主义不共戴天的伟大力量。美帝国主义对中国工农红军恨至切骨，它以大量美金援助蒋介石作“剿匪”经费，帮助蒋介石建立空军，并派美人参加蒋匪的“军事顾问团”直接布置各次“围剿”。　·吴耘·
    （十七）一九三七年在日本侵华准备阶段中，美对日输送大批战争物资，占日本发动战争全部军火之半数以上。至一九三八年，当中国人民遭受日寇奸淫烧杀最苦难的年代，美帝仍不断对日输出杀人物资，占日本作战物资全部消耗百分之九十二。　·涂克·
    （十八）一九四一年十二月，太平洋战事爆发，美帝一面以大量物资给蒋介石围困“民主中国”——陕甘宁抗日民主根据地之用，一面则与蒋介石一起坐在峨嵋山上袖手旁观着中国人民与日寇搏斗。　·沈柔坚·
