　　[Our Dispatch] Two thousand students from Tsinghua University set out on the 14th and 15th to conduct propaganda among workers in over ten locations including the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, the 70th Ordnance Factory, the General Machinery Factory, the Qinghe Woolen Mill, the Changxindian Railway Factory, Fengtai, and Nankou. The 120 students from the Aeronautics Department who conducted propaganda in the Nankou area of the Beijing-Suiyuan Railway returned to the school on the afternoon of the 20th.

　　During their time in Nankou, the students of the department set out in teams every morning at 6:30 to give speeches to the workers or participate in the workers' discussion meetings. From 7:00 to 8:00, over a hundred small group discussion meetings or speeches involving forty to over six hundred people were simultaneously conducted throughout the area. The workers listened intently, saying, "Every word the students say goes right to my heart." They universally asked, "Students, please tell us more!" In the evenings, symposiums were held, with a total of eight symposiums for young workers, the elderly, and women. At the symposiums, students and workers crowded together for intimate discussions. Everyone poured out their hatred of American imperialism.

　　The students used various methods to approach the workers and conduct propaganda. Initially, students from Aviation Class 1 worked alongside the workers in the materials factory, lifting gate plates and iron rings. When the workers finished their shifts, the students put on slide shows and crosstalk performances at the factory gate. In the evenings, they visited workers' dormitories and homes. At the engine division, they chatted with resting engineers and stokers. Some students got up at 3:00 a.m. to catch the train to Changping, Shahe, Qinghe, and other stations to conduct propaganda.

　　Through this propaganda, the workers' hatred of American imperialism deepened, their confidence in victory increased, and their enthusiasm rose. They universally said, "Treat the machines as weapons and the factory as a battlefield!" "Don't waste a minute, complete the production tasks ahead of schedule!" "Oppose traitors and spies!" One old worker who had planned to retire resolutely stated that he would not retire after hearing that American imperialism had invaded, and he even asked to work more. The workers' enthusiasm for learning also increased. An old worker with white hair and a white beard saw the students explaining maps and copied them stroke by stroke, saying, "Write down all the times the American devils invaded us in the past so we can recite them every day." Young worker Bao Xihua returned to conduct propaganda after studying, and discovered many new problems, so he ran back to discuss them with the students.

　　On Sunday, when the workers went home, the students continued to conduct propaganda on the trains. One PLA soldier named Huangye wrote a note to the students at the time, saying, "Your words are like a call to battle issued to me by the motherland. I am determined to dedicate everything, even my life, to defend the motherland!" He stood up and gave a speech to the passengers. An old villager in his seventies, with tears in his eyes, clenched his fists and shouted slogans along with him.

　　As the students were leaving, the workers reluctantly beat drums and blew bugles to send them off, saying, "With the workers and students combining their strengths, the power to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend the country is even stronger!" They made mutual guarantees. The students said, "We will continue to expand the propaganda work when we return, study hard, and be ready to dedicate ourselves to the motherland at any time." The workers also resolutely stated, "Step up production and guarantee transportation."

　　清华航空系同学南口宣传胜利归来
    工人学生两股劲拧成一股劲，打垮美国侵略军！
    【本报讯】清华大学同学二千人在十四日、十五日出发到石景山钢铁厂、七十兵工厂、机械总厂、清河制呢厂、长辛店铁路工厂、丰台、南口等十余地向工人进行宣传。在京绥路南口地区进行宣传的航空系一百二十个同学，已于二十日下午回校。
    该系同学在南口期间，每天早上六点半，就一队队出发，向工友讲演，或参加工友的讨论会。七点到八点，在全地区同时进行着百余小组的讨论会，或四十余人到六百余人的演讲会。工友们都聚精会神地说着、听着。不少工友说：“同学们讲的句句都说到我的心眼里去了。”普遍提出：“同学们，多给咱们讲讲吧！”一到晚上，就开座谈会。前后开了青工、老年、妇女座谈会共八次。座谈会上，同学和工友挤在一起，亲切地讨论。大家一一把自己对美帝的仇恨诉出来。
    同学们用各种方法去接近工人和向工人进行宣传。起初，航一同学在材料厂和工人一起劳动，抬闸片、铁圈，工友下工时，同学们在车间门口，拉洋片、说相声，晚上到工人宿舍、工人家庭去访问。在机务段和休息的机师、司炉漫谈。一部分同学上午三点起床，赶火车到昌平、沙河、清河等站去宣传。
    经过这些宣传，工友们对美帝的仇恨加深了，胜利的信心增强了，热情也提高了。普遍地说：“把机器当武器，工厂当战场！”“不浪费一分钟，提前完成生产任务！”“反奸反特！”有一位老工友本想退休，听到美帝来侵略，坚决表示不退休，而且要求多干活。工友们的学习热情也提高了。一位头发、胡子都白了的工友，看见同学讲解地图，就一笔笔地描下来，还说：“你们把美国鬼子从前侵略咱们的时间都写下来，让咱们每天念念吧。”青工包锡华学习后回去宣传，又发现了很多新问题，就跑回来和同学们商量。
    星期天，工人回家，同学们继续进行列车宣传。有一位叫荒野的解放军战士当时写条子给同学，说：“你们说的话，就好像祖国向我发出的战斗的号召。我坚决要献出一切，甚至生命，保卫祖国！”并站起来向旅客演讲。一位七十多岁的老乡，两眼充满了泪珠，紧握着拳头，跟着喊口号。
    同学们要走了，工友们恋恋不舍地打着腰鼓，吹着军号来欢送。并且说：“咱们工人、学生两股劲拧成一股劲，抗美援朝保家卫国的力量更壮大了！”彼此并提出保证。同学们说：“回去一定继续扩大宣传工作，努力学习，准备随时把自己献给祖国。”工友们也坚决提出“加紧生产，保证运输”。
