How to Learn the Art of Skits?

Young Soviet journalists ask: How can one learn the art of skits? How to write them?

Writing skits can hardly be "taught." All writers arrive by their own paths, and they work hard on language and style. In order to find writing methods, some people turn to old-fashioned, bourgeois skit masters, to Durosevic, Amfiteatrov, Yablonovsky, and Averchenko. Undoubtedly, these are talented writers, masters of their own business. This is a lively, free newspaper language, as well as a school of bad literary taste. Knowing them is beneficial. Imitating them is harmful.

One should learn from the classic writers of Marxist criticism, from Marx and Engels, from Lenin and Stalin. For a skit writer who is a Bolshevik newspaper worker, mastering Marxism-Leninism is necessary. But, in addition to this, Soviet skit writers also need to study the language of Marx and Engels, Lenin and Stalin, and carefully consider: how they construct sentences, how they use expressive methods, and how they argue against the enemy.

Studying the works of Marxist classics from the perspective of language and style is to pursue the source of satire that these classics used to cultivate their writing skills.

Marx and Engels were proficient in the valuable works of world artistic literature. We only need to mention the classical satirical works encountered in the works of Marx and Engels: these are the works of the great satirical writers of the ancient world—Aristophanes, Lucian, Juvenal. Studying their works will enrich Soviet skit writers. Soviet skit writers should know the main works of Rabelais, Shakespeare (especially his comedies), Swift, Cervantes, as well as Voltaire, Heine, and Dickens.

The great power of Lenin's and Stalin's works stems from their great familiarity with Russian and foreign classical literature. Language needs to be learned from Pushkin (his prose), Lermontov, Turgenev, Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, Leskov, and Gorky. In Russian literature, the teachers of satire are Krylov, Griboyedov, Herzen, Saltykov-Shchedrin, Prutkov, Chekhov, and Mayakovsky.

This is the literary source of powerful and sharp language, this is the literary school of satire and humor. The vivid folk language and folk songs are also of great significance in this respect. In folk creations, in folk tales, proverbs, sayings, folk myths, and jokes, there is a treasure of humor. One should listen carefully to the language of the people and learn from them the art of concise and sharp description. The people have been and still are great literary masters and great teachers of language.

    怎样学会小品艺术？
    年轻的苏维埃新闻工作者们问：怎样才能学会小品艺术？怎样写？
    写小品几乎不能是“教会”的。一切作家都是走各自的道路而来的，他们在语言和风格上下过功夫。为了寻求写作方法，有些人求诸于旧式的、资产阶级的小品名家，求诸于杜罗塞维奇、阿姆菲吉阿特罗夫、亚勃洛诺夫斯基、阿维尔金科。无疑义的，这些是有才能的作家，是他们自己事业的名家。这是活泼的、自由的报纸语言以及恶劣的文学趣味的一派。知道它们是有益的。模仿他们是有害的。
    应该向马克思主义评论的古典作家，向马克思和恩格斯，向列宁和斯大林学习。对于作为布尔什维克报纸工作者的小品作家来讲，精通马列主义是必要的。但是，除此之外，苏联小品作家还须要研究马克思和恩格斯的，列宁和斯大林的语言，须要仔细思考：他们怎样造句，怎样运用表达方法，怎样对敌人争论。
    从语言和风格方面去研究马克思主义古典作家的作品，这就是追求这些古典作家借以培养自己写作技巧的讽刺文学的渊源。
    马克思和恩格斯精通世界艺术文学的宝贵著作。我们只要举出在马克思和恩格斯作品里所遇到的古典讽刺著作：这就是古代世界这些伟大讽刺作家的作品——亚里斯多芬、鲁善、朱维纳尔。研究他们的作品就会充实苏联的小品作家。苏联小品作家应该知道拉伯雷、莎士比亚（特别是他的喜剧）、斯维夫特、塞万提斯以及伏尔泰、海涅、狄更斯的主要作品。
    列宁和斯大林作品之产生巨大力量是由于他们非常娴熟俄罗斯和外国的古典文学。语言须要向普式金（他的散文）、莱蒙托夫、屠格涅夫、托尔斯泰、杜斯退益夫斯基、列斯考夫、高尔基去学习。在俄罗斯文学里，讽刺的老师是克里洛夫、格里波耶道夫、赫尔岑、谢德林、普鲁特考夫、契诃夫、马雅柯夫斯基。
    这就是有力而尖锐的语言的文学渊源，这就是讽刺和幽默的文学派别。生动的民间语言，民谣这一方面也是具有很重要的意义的。在民间的创造里，在民间传说、谚语、格言、民间神话和笑话里，含有幽默的宝藏。应该细听人民的语言，向他们学习简短而尖锐的描写的艺术。人民曾经是并且仍然是伟大的文学大家和伟大的语言教师。
