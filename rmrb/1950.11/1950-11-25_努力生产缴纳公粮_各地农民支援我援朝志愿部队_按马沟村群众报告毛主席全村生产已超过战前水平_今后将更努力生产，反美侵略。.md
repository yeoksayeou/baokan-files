　　Strive to Increase Production and Pay Public Grain
    Peasants in Various Regions Support the Chinese People's Volunteers in the Korean War
    According to a Report from the Masses in Anmagou Village, Production in the Entire Village Has Exceeded Pre-War Levels
    Will Work Harder in the Future to Produce and Oppose American Aggression.
    Dear Chairman Mao:
    We, the masses of Anmagou Village, Tenth District, Yanggao County, Chahar Province, have actively responded to your call and have established the idea of laboring and producing to become prosperous. The production of the entire village has exceeded pre-war levels. We had a bumper harvest this year. No household in our village lacks food, and more than half of the households have surplus grain. Livestock has also increased significantly, and the lives of the masses have gradually improved from poverty, leading to high morale in production. We are prepared to pay all of this year's public grain at once, and the quality will be good. The entire village is working hard to further increase production, using the practical actions of active labor to oppose American imperialist aggression and support our volunteer forces and the Korean patriotic self-defense war. Now, we are reporting to you the production situation of our entire village:
    Our village is a small rural village fifty miles south of Yanggao City. Before liberation in 1945, there were 38 households, 289 people, 2,350 mu of land, 25 donkeys, 6 mules, 270 sheep, and 7 carts. At that time, 70% of the households in the village borrowed money from landlords to make a living. 30% of the households in the village could not support their families by farming and worked as long-term laborers for landlords or sold short-term labor outside. The annual income, after repaying debts, paying rent, and covering travel expenses, was minimal. Every year after the beginning of spring, 7 or 8 out of 10 households had no food to eat, relying on bran and vegetables to survive. Since liberation, land reform was carried out in 1946, and land reform review was conducted in 1947. Under the strong leadership of the local government, there are now 64 households with 296 people in the entire village, 2,637 mu of cultivated land (including 507 mu of newly reclaimed wasteland last year and this year), 42 donkeys, 2 mules, 3 cattle, and 8 carts. The vast majority of households have livestock. There are currently 352 sheep, more than one per person on average. There are 43 pigs, with an average of two pigs raised per three households. Taking livestock as an example, before the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression, our village had only about 20 livestock, now exceeding nearly 20. The land area has also expanded. Before land reform, our village usually yielded an average of two shi dou of grain per mu per year. This year, due to intensive cultivation and better weather, the average yield is four shi dou of grain per mu. Many elderly people in the village say that they have never encountered such a good harvest in their fifties or sixties. Every household has full granaries. This year (referring to the period from after the autumn harvest to next summer), no household lacks food, and more than half have surplus grain. Before liberation, there were 16 or 17 thieves, opium addicts, and idlers in the village who did not engage in productive work. This year, none of them are unemployed. Our village has achieved great results in reclaiming wasteland. Last year, when the higher authorities called for wasteland reclamation, some masses had concerns and feared burdens, so they dared not reclaim. Due to the active promotion of policies by our village secretary Ma Jiang and other cadres, and their taking the lead (Ma Jiang reclaimed 30 mu, yielding more than six da shi of grain this year), a total of 310 mu were reclaimed. The crops grown on the reclaimed land this year are particularly good, yielding an average of two da dou per mu. This year's public grain burden is lighter than last year, totaling 23 da shi of rice, which is enough to pay with the grain increased from wasteland reclamation. Therefore, the morale of the masses is even higher. Everyone says: This year's public grain will be paid off in one day, the quality will be inspected well, and it will be guaranteed to meet the standards. Due to the actual benefits obtained from wasteland reclamation last year, the masses seized the time to reclaim another 293 mu after weeding this summer.
    This spring's seed soaking work, due to the cadres taking the lead, achieved seed soaking in every household, and the vast majority of crops did not suffer from black ear disease this year. During summer weeding, party members served as the backbone, organizing seven labor teams, which were completed five days ahead of schedule. Sorghum, yams, and millet were hoed three times. Other crops were hoed at least twice. During autumn protection, the militia was organized to be responsible for different areas, and no theft cases occurred. Last year, due to the cadres' patient persuasion, mobilization of the masses and taking the lead, the conservative habits of the masses not plowing in the autumn were reversed. Out of the village's more than 2,100 mu of land, 1,600 mu were plowed, and all arable land was plowed. This year, as of October 25, 1,570 mu have been plowed, and it is estimated that all can be completed in another ten days. Currently, except for five households (lacking labor) that have not reached the level of middle peasants, other households have reached the living standards of middle peasants (22 poor peasant households before land reform).
    The reason our village's production has achieved such great results is mainly due to the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party. Secondly, our village cadres (mainly seven cadres, six emancipated poor peasants, and one middle peasant) are fair in their work and lead the masses by setting an example. In the future, under your leadership, we will actively produce, cultivate intensively, improve technology, develop animal husbandry, reclaim wasteland and plant trees, and better organize ourselves (we have not done enough in this regard in the past), to further improve production, and use our achievements in active production to oppose American imperialist aggression and aid the Korean War. Whoever bullies us, we will resolutely drive them out.
    This report is submitted
    And we wish you
    Good health
    The masses of Anmagou Village, Yanggao County

　　努力生产缴纳公粮
    各地农民支援我援朝志愿部队
    按马沟村群众报告毛主席全村生产已超过战前水平
    今后将更努力生产，反美侵略。
    亲爱的毛主席：
    我们察哈尔省阳高县第十区按马沟村群众积极响应您的号召，已树立了劳动生产、走向富裕的思想，全村生产已超过战前水平。今年丰收，我村没有一户不够吃的人家，并且有一半以上的户有了余粮，牲畜也增加了很多，群众生活由贫穷渐渐上升了，生产情绪高涨。今年公粮我们准备一次全部交清，质量还要好。全村群众正努力把生产继续提高一步，以积极劳动的实际行动来反对美帝侵略，支援我志愿部队，支援朝鲜爱国自卫战争。现在把我们全村的生产情形向您报告一下：
    我村是阳高城南五十里地的一个小农村。一九四五年解放以前，有三十八户人家，二百八十九口人，土地二千三百五十亩，驴二十五头，骡六头，羊二百七十只，大车七辆。那时全村百分之七十的人家向地主借债生活。全村百分之三十的户，因种地养不了家，给地主当长工或出外卖短工。一年的收入除了还债交租出差以外，所余无几。每年入春以后，十户就有七、八户没吃的，依靠糠菜过日子。自解放以后，一九四六年进行了土地改革，一九四七年又经过了土改复查。在当地政府大力领导下，现在全村有六十四户人家二百九十六人，耕地二千六百三十七亩（内有去年和今年新开的荒五百零七亩），有驴四十二头，骡子两头，牛三头，大车八辆，绝大多数人家有了牲口。现有羊三百五十二只，平均每人一只还多。猪四十三只，平均三户养二只猪。就以牲口来讲，抗日战争前，我村不过二十多个牲畜，现在超过近二十个。土地面积也扩大了。土改以前，我村每亩地通常年头平均打粮二市斗，今年由于精耕细作，年成也较好，每亩平均打粮四市斗。村中不少老年人说，活了五、六十岁，没逢到这样好收成。家家户户粮食满仓。今年（指过秋以后至明年夏）没一户不够吃的人家，有余粮者足够一半以上。解放以前，村里小偷、烟鬼，不务正业的游民十六、七个，今年没一个不劳动的了。我村开荒成绩很好。去年上级号召开荒，有些群众思想有顾虑，怕负担，不敢开，由于我村支书马江等干部积极宣传政策，并首先带头（马江就开了三十亩，今年多打粮六大石多），共开荒三百一十亩。今年开的荒地，庄稼长的特别好，每亩平均收二大斗，今年公粮负担比去年轻了些，共负担米二十三大石，只用开荒增粮即够缴公粮了。因此群众情绪更高了，大家都说：今年公粮只用一天就全部交清，质量检查好，保证合格。由于去年开荒，今年得到了实际利益，群众在今年夏锄完以后，抓紧了时间又开荒二百九十三亩。
    今春浸种工作，由于干部亲自带头，做到了户户浸种，今年庄稼绝大部分没起黑穗病。夏锄时以党员为骨干，组织了七个拨工组，提早五天完成。高粱、山药、谷子都锄了三遍。其他庄稼至少锄了二遍。护秋当中组织民兵分片负责，没发生一起偷盗案件。去年由于干部耐心说服动员群众和带头，扭转了群众不秋耕的保守习惯。全村二千一百多亩地耕过一千六百亩，应耕地都耕了。今年到十月二十五日已耕过一千五百七十亩，估计再有十天就可全部耕完。现我村除五户（缺乏劳力）还没达到中农以外，其他户都达到中农生活水平了（土改前二十二户贫农）。
    我们村的生产所以得到这样大的成绩，主要是由于毛主席共产党领导，其次是我村干部（主要干部七个，六个翻身贫农，一个中农）办事公道，以身作则带领群众。我们今后要在您的领导下，积极生产，精耕细作，改良技术，发展畜牧，开荒植树，更好地组织起来（以往我们这点做的不够），把生产更提高一步，以我们积极生产的成绩来反对美帝侵略，援助朝鲜战争。谁要欺侮我们，就坚决把他打出去。
    谨此报告
    并祝您
    身体健康
    阳高县按马沟村全体群众
