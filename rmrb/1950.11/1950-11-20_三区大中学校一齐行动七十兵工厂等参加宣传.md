　　Three District Universities and Colleges Act Together, No. 70 Ordnance Factory and Others Participate in Propaganda
    [Our Newspaper] On the morning of the 19th, from 11:00 AM to 5:00 PM, major universities, colleges, and some factories in the Third District of Beijing carried out extensive propaganda activities for resisting America, aiding Korea, protecting our homes, and defending the country. The units involved included Renmin University of China, the Engineering College of North China University, the First Midwifery School, Workers' School, Jihigh School, Provincial Normal School, Fifth Middle School, Second Girls' Middle School, Yude, Chongci, No. 70 Ordnance Factory, and the Mechanical General Factory, totaling twelve units. The number of participants exceeded four thousand, including teachers and staff from the schools. Among these units, No. 70 Ordnance Factory, the Mechanical General Factory, and Tsinghua students held mass meetings at Yonghe Temple, while the Second Girls' Middle School held cartoon exhibitions and performed various programs at their own school. Other schools were divided into thirty-seven teams of varying sizes to conduct mobile street propaganda. The number of citizens watching at various locations was approximately over thirty thousand. Wherever the teams went, the masses flocked from all directions. The propaganda team members used various methods such as speeches, clapper talk, and crosstalk to explain the relationship between China and Korea, the crimes and conspiracies of American imperialism in invading China, and the fact that American imperialism is a paper tiger. The emotions of the audience and the propaganda team members were fused together. Indignation and passion showed the Chinese people's deep hatred for American imperialism and their determination and belief in protecting their homes and defending the country.
    After watching a living newspaper play, an old man in Gulou said, "We suffered enough when the little devils of Japan came in the past. Now that the American imperialists are following the same old path, how can we not fight them?" Children threw stones at the actors playing Chiang Kai-shek and Truman, cursing them as bastards. When the students from the Provincial Normal School spoke about how Americans used to humiliate and kill rickshaw pullers in China, the rickshaw pullers present were all attentive, showing deep hatred.

　　三区大中学校一齐行动七十兵工厂等参加宣传
    【本报讯】京市第三区各大、中学校及部分工厂在十九日上午十一时到下午五时进行了广泛的抗美援朝保家卫国的宣传活动。出动的计有人民大学、华大工学院、第一助产学校、职工学校、冀高、省师、五中、女二中、育德、崇慈、七十兵工厂、机械总厂等十二单位。参加的人数在四千人以上。学校中有教员及工友参加。这些单位中，七十兵工厂、机械总厂与清华同学在雍和宫，女二中在本校分别召开群众大会，举行漫画展览，演出各种节目；其他学校则分开编成人数不等的三十七队在街头进行流动宣传。各处的市民观众约在三万人以上。队伍每到一处，群众即自四方蜂拥而至。宣传队员以讲演、快板、相声等各种不同的方式说明中国与朝鲜的关系、美帝侵华的罪行与阴谋以及美帝是一只纸老虎等问题。观众与宣传队员情绪溶成一片。愤慨，激昂，显示出中国人民对美帝国主义的深刻的仇恨以及保家卫国的决心与信念。
    鼓楼一个老头儿在看完活报剧后说：“小日本过去来的时候，咱们真够受的。今天美帝又走它的老路，咱们怎么能不打它？”小孩儿们扔石子打扮演蒋介石、杜鲁门的演员，骂它们王八蛋。当省师同学讲美国人过去在中国怎样侮辱，杀害三轮车工人时，在场三轮工人都精神贯注，表现出深刻的仇恨。
