The British Labour Party's Daily Mirror also admits: Chinese people enlisting as volunteers are the same as British people enlisting in the Spanish Civil War.
The French Communist Party's L'Humanité says: No one ever condemned Lafayette for helping the United States win independence.

Xinhua News Agency, 10th -- After the frantic American aggressors were defeated by the Korean People's Army and retreated south of the Chongchon River, they openly clamored to further invade our Northeast. According to a Washington 7th dispatch from Agence France-Presse, an anonymous "important American figure," after slandering the Chinese people's volunteer action to resist US aggression and aid Korea as "interference" and "aggression" against Korea, openly stated that the United States is attempting to force the UN Security Council to "grant MacArthur discretionary power," so that "he can take any strategic action against Manchuria—such as aerial bombardment—as long as he deems it necessary." An American "observer" at Success Lake also stated, "The United Nations must authorize MacArthur to attack important areas north of the Yalu River" (Associated Press).

In fact, while the US military on the western front was collapsing, the US military on the eastern front continued to frantically invade our Northeast border. Almond, commander of the US 10th Corps, David, commander of the 7th Infantry Division, and Keiffer, commander of the 7th Artillery Division, "inspected" the "US front line in the extreme north of Korea" south of the Sino-Korean border on the 5th. At dawn on the 6th, the US 7th Division "began to advance towards the Chinese Northeast border" (Kuomintang Central News Agency). The American aggressors, with a guilty conscience, "have requested that the troops approaching Manchuria be called United Nations troops, not American troops" (Associated Press).

The American aggressors' slander that the Chinese people's just volunteer action to resist US aggression and aid Korea is "interference" and "aggression" against Korea is self-defeating. It is the American aggressors themselves who are truly interfering in the Korean civil war and aggressing against Korea. Even the American aggressors' lackey, the Korean traitor Syngman Rhee, admits this. When a United Press reporter asked Syngman Rhee whether he thought the participation of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army in the war "expanded the war beyond the scope of a 'civil war'," Syngman Rhee frankly admitted: "The stage of civil war ended when the United Nations forces (i.e., the US military) participated in the war" (United Press). At the same time, "people close to MacArthur" had to admit that the situation in Korea today "is like the situation in Spain during the Spanish Civil War" (Associated Press). That is to say, in Korea, as in Spain at that time, on the one hand, there were interventionist troops from the US and Britain, just like Hitler and Mussolini's interventionist forces, and on the other hand, there were volunteer forces from the Chinese people, just like the international brigades of people from various countries. The British Labour Party's Daily Mirror also admitted: "Chinese people enlisting as volunteers is the same as British people enlisting in the Spanish Civil War" (Agence France-Presse). Everyone knows that during the Spanish Civil War from 1936 to 1939, when Hitler and Mussolini sent troops to help Franco carry out the Spanish counter-revolutionary civil war, the people of France, Britain, and the United States participated in the international brigades to support the Spanish people's revolutionary war.

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 10th -- The French newspaper L'Humanité published a commentary on the 8th entitled "The Chinese People's Volunteer Army's Assistance to Korea is Beneficial to the Cause of Peace," stating:

The US imperialists' aggressive actions in Korea are becoming increasingly miserable. The US imperialists' attempt to turn Korea into a base for aggression against the Chinese people and the people of Asia has aroused the entire Korean people to oppose them. Now, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army has told the US imperialists that the Chinese people understand their conspiracy and are determined to fight against their conspiracy. The Chinese People's Volunteer Army is fighting side by side with the Korean people. This is their right, just as the Korean People's Volunteer Army has the right to fight in the Chinese People's Liberation Army. No one has ever thought of condemning Lafayette, blaming him for helping the United States win independence. (Note: During the American people's war of independence against British colonialists at the end of the 18th century, the French people organized volunteer troops to participate in the war. Lafayette was one of the leaders of the French volunteer troops.)

### 我人民抗美援朝志愿行动是正义的  美帝污蔑中国人民的谰言不攻自破

　　我人民抗美援朝志愿行动是正义的
    美帝污蔑中国人民的谰言不攻自破
    英工党每日镜报也承认：中国人民报名当志愿兵，是和报名参加西班牙内战的英国人一样的。
    法共人道报说：过去谁也不曾非难法国的拉斐德，责备他帮助美国赢得了独立。
    【新华社十日讯】疯狂的美国侵略者在朝鲜人民军反击下败退至清川江以南后，竟然公开叫嚣要进一步侵犯我国东北。据法新社华盛顿七日电，一个匿名“美国要人”在污蔑中国人民抗美援朝的志愿行动是对朝鲜的“干涉”和“侵略”之后，公然表明：美国正企图迫使联合国安理会“赋予麦克阿瑟以自由裁夺之权”，“只要他认为必要，就可对满洲采取任何战略行动——如空军轰炸之类”。成功湖的美国“观察家”也表示，“联合国必须授权麦克阿瑟攻击鸭绿江以北的重要地区”（美联社）。
    事实上，在西线美军溃败之际，东线美军仍在继续向我国东北边境疯狂进犯。美侵略军第十兵团司令阿尔梦德、第七步兵师师长巴大维、第七炮兵师师长凯弗曾于五日“巡视”中朝边境以南的“朝鲜极北部的美军前线”。六日拂晓，美军第七师即“开始向中国东北边境进发”（国民党中央社）。作贼心虚的美国侵略者“已要求把逼近满洲的部队称为联合国军队，而不称为美国军队。”（美联社）
    美国侵略者污蔑中国人民正义的抗美援朝的志愿行动为对朝鲜“干涉”和“侵略”的谰言，是不攻自破的。真正干涉朝鲜内战、侵略朝鲜的正是美国侵略者自己。这一点就连美国侵略者的走狗、朝鲜卖国贼李承晚也承认。当合众社记者询问李承晚是否认为中国人民志愿部队的参加作战“使战争扩大到超出‘内战’的范围”时，李承晚率直地承认说：“内战的阶段在联合国军（按即美军）参战时就成为过去了。”（合众社）同时，“接近麦克阿瑟的人士”也不得不承认：朝鲜今天的情况“像西班牙内战期间的西班牙的情况。”（美联社）这就是说，在朝鲜如同在当时的西班牙，一方面有如同希特勒、墨索里尼的干涉军一样的美英的干涉军，另一方面有如同各国人民的国际纵队一样的中国人民的志愿部队。英国工党的每日镜报也承认：“中国人报名当志愿兵是和报名参加西班牙内战的英国人一样的。”（法新社）大家知道：在一九三六至一九三九年西班牙内战期间，当希特勒与墨索里尼派兵帮助佛朗哥进行西班牙反革命内战时，法国、英国和美国人民都曾参加支援西班牙人民革命战争的国际纵队。
    【新华社布拉格十日电】法国《人道报》八日以《中国人民志愿部队援助朝鲜有益于和平事业》为题发表评论称：
    美帝国主义者在朝鲜的侵略行为，前途是越来越悲惨了。美帝国主义者企图把朝鲜变为侵略中国人民和亚洲人民的基地，这种行为使朝鲜全体人民都奋起反对他们。现在，中国人民志愿部队告诉了美帝国主义者，中国人民了解他们的阴谋，并且决心为反对他们的阴谋而战斗。中国人民志愿部队正与朝鲜人民并肩作战，这是他们的权利，正如朝鲜人民志愿部队有权利在中国人民解放军中作战一样。过去谁也不曾想非难拉斐德，责备他帮助美国赢得了独立。（按在十八世纪末美国人民进行反对英国殖民者的独立战争时，法国人民曾组织志愿军参战。拉斐德是法国志愿军的领导者之一。）
