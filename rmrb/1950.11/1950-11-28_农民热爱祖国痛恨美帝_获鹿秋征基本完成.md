　　Peasants Love the Motherland and Hate American Imperialism
    Huolu Autumn Grain Collection Basically Completed

    [Our Newspaper] Hebei Province's Huolu County peasants are enthusiastically handing over public grain in the sacred movement to Resist America, Aid Korea, Protect Our Homes and Defend the Nation. Since the assignment of quotas to households began on the 3rd of this month, in just ten days, the county's 11,853,000+ *jin* (of grain) in public grain has been basically completed. Over 90% has been placed in storage (only individual households cannot immediately clear accounts because peanuts have not yet been dried). Now, the focus of work has shifted to autumn plowing inspection, striving to plow all arable land once or twice before the Minor Snow solar term.

    This year's autumn collection is taking place at a time when American imperialism is frantically attacking the Korean people and directly threatening our country's security. Some hidden special agents are taking the opportunity to stir up trouble and spread rumors. Therefore, when implementing the collection policy at all-levels People's Representative Conferences, the slogans "Be sure to closely integrate current affairs propaganda with the implementation of the collection policy," "Resolutely complete the task using the mass line method," and "Raise the political awareness of the masses and expand the Resist America, Aid Korea movement" were loudly put forward. After group discussions and speeches at the conference, the representatives clarified their understanding of the consistency of policies and tasks and the importance of doing a good job in propaganda work. The representatives' enthusiasm was particularly high, and they unanimously expressed their determination to support our volunteer army and the Korean people with practical actions to complete the autumn collection.

  Deepening Current Affairs Propaganda Throughout the County – Peasants Launch Patriotic Upsurge

    Before the collection tasks were assigned to households, the propaganda work was: In addition to explaining the current situation, exposing the atrocities and conspiracies of American imperialism, and clarifying our attitude and this year's collection policy at various mass meetings, mass propaganda was carried out through various organizational systems, using diverse forms such as blackboards, radio stations, door-to-door visits, on the land, and in markets. Everywhere, one could see and hear about opposing the despicable and shameless conspiracies of American imperialism, resolutely aiding the Korean people, and how to carry out the autumn collection. The masses generally understood that: to obtain lasting freedom and happiness and strengthen the nation's power, actively paying public grain is one of the effective methods to strike at American imperialism. Therefore, a wave of grain delivery quickly swept across the county, with villages and households selecting and drying cotton. The quality of the cotton delivered to the warehouses generally reached Grade A Superior, Grade A, and Grade B Superior. The masses in the Fourth District generally reflected: "In order to consolidate national defense and strengthen national construction, we are willing to hand over more public grain. Otherwise, if the American imperialists come, we won't be able to eat even if we have more grain." Fifty-five villages in the First District have completely completed the autumn collection.

  Implementing the Mass Line Method – Collection Work Proceeds Smoothly

    After the rectification movement, the work style of cadres has been greatly improved. In the autumn collection, all districts generally adopted effective methods to promote work, such as conducting in-depth inspections, providing timely notifications, and carrying out commendations and criticisms. From the beginning of assigning tasks to households to the present, the county party committee organs and the collection committee have issued a total of eight communications and circulars. The Fourth District issued four circulars, the First District three, and the Second District two. The First and Fourth Districts made the fastest and smoothest progress. The primary reason is that in-depth inspections promptly notified the entire district of deviations and successful experiences that occurred, allowing other villages to emulate or be vigilant. For example, the Fourth District discovered that Nanbaisha and Zhangbao were not only collecting high-quality cotton, but also created a more scientific method of transporting it to the warehouse (i.e., based on the quality of the cotton handed over, the masses voluntarily formed groups and selected a group leader to accompany and send it to the warehouse), which avoided wasting labor and the trouble of verification at the cotton station. The district immediately notified the entire district to adopt this method. On November 6, the district discovered that the cadres of Shanglü Village were not handling matters in accordance with policy, and had privately allocated more public grain without the approval of the district or county, attempting to make up for past deficits. This was quickly corrected and notified to the entire district. The First District's Xiyangzhuang and the Fifth District's Dahe and other villages quickly completed their tasks using the mass line method. After timely notification to the entire county, it had a significant effect on encouraging and inspiring the emotions of other villages and improving work styles.

    All village cadres and party member representatives deeply experienced what the mass line is from this year's collection, and that only with the mass line method of work can various work tasks be completed smoothly and the support of the masses be obtained. At the beginning of conveying the autumn collection task, some village cadres and party members had low confidence in completing the autumn collection task using the mass line method, and felt that the task and policy were difficult to reconcile. Some village cadres still believed that as long as they asked the masses for something, the masses would definitely not be happy; to complete the task on time, they would have to be somewhat coercive. But in actual work, they all personally tasted this point: As long as they patiently publicize, explain the policies and principles clearly, and take their own active exemplary lead to motivate the masses, they will quickly complete the task in accordance with the policy; the masses will be happy. Until the basic completion of the collection, no cases of conflicts with the masses or forced grain delivery were found in any village. Liang Chou'ni (female), the CCP branch secretary of the Seventh Street of Chengguan Neighborhood in the First District, often had an attitude towards the masses in her previous work, deducting at the drop of a hat and fining at the pursing of her lips. This time in the collection, she also deeply realized that problems cannot be solved only by patiently explaining and clarifying the principles, and compulsory orders. At the same time, many model branches and model party members, league members, and cadres emerged during this autumn collection. The work enthusiasm of village cadres has been unprecedentedly improved, and the past thinking that being a cadre offends people has also dissipated by itself, and the atmosphere of striving for model cadres has become increasingly strong.

　　农民热爱祖国痛恨美帝
    获鹿秋征基本完成
    【本报讯】河北省获鹿县农民在神圣的抗美援朝保家卫国运动中，踊跃缴纳公粮。自本月三日开始向户布置，仅十天工夫，全县一千一百八十五万三千余斤（谷）公粮已基本完成，入库已达百分之九十以上（只有个别户因花生未晒干，而不能马上清账）。现在，工作重点已转入秋耕检查，争取在小雪前将应耕的地普耕一遍或两遍。
    今年秋征正处在美帝疯狂进攻朝鲜人民，并直接威胁着我国安全的时候，一些暗藏的特务分子乘机骚动，大肆造谣。因此在各界人民代表大会上贯彻征收政策时，响亮地提出了：“一定要密切结合时事宣传贯彻征收政策”、“坚决以群众路线的方法完成任务”、“提高群众政治认识，扩大抗美援朝运动”等口号。经过小组讨论、大会发言，代表们在思想上明确认识了政策与任务的一致性与做好宣传工作的重要性。代表们情绪特别高涨，一致表示坚决以完成秋征的实际行动来支援我志愿部队及朝鲜人民。
  全县深入宣传时事  农民掀起爱国热潮
    在征收任务尚未向户布置之前，宣传工作是：除在各种群众会上讲解目前形势，揭露美帝的暴行及阴谋，我们应抱的态度及今年的征收政策外，并通过了各个组织系统，以黑板报、广播台、串门、地头上、集市上等多种多样的不同形式展开了群众性的宣传。到处都可以看见、听到反对美帝卑鄙无耻的阴谋，坚决援助朝鲜人民，及如何进行秋征的作法等。群众普遍地了解到：要想得到永久的自由幸福，充实国家力量，积极缴纳公粮是有效的打击美帝的方法之一。因此，全县很快地掀起缴粮热潮，村村户户拣晒棉花。缴纳入库的棉花质量，一般都达到甲上、甲、乙上等级。四区群众普遍反映说：“为了巩固国防，加强国家建设，再多掏点公粮也情愿，不然美帝来了，粮食再多也吃不到嘴里。”一区五十五个村，已彻底完成了秋征。
  贯彻群众路线方法  征收工作顺利进行
    经过整风运动，干部工作作风有极大改进。秋征中各区都普遍采用了深入检查工作，及时通报，进行表扬批评的推动工作的有效方法。自开始向户布置到现在，县党委机关及征收委员会共出通讯、通报八次。四区出通报四次。一区三次。二区两次。一、四区进行的最快，并很顺利，首要原因就是深入检查将所发生的偏差及成功经验及时通报全区，使其他村庄效法或提起警惕。如四区发现南白沙、张堡征棉当中不但质量高，而在运送入库时创造了较科学的办法（即根据所缴棉花的质量高低，群众自愿结组，选出组长跟随前往送入仓库），这样避免了浪费劳力及棉站上的验级麻烦。该区随即将此办法通报全区采用。十一月六日，该区检查出上吕村干部不按政策办事，未经区、县批准私自多派公粮，企图补出过去的亏空的作法，很快纠正，并通报全区。一区西杨庄、五区大河等村，以群众路线的方法，很快完成任务，及时通报全县后，对鼓励启发其他村的情绪及改进工作作风上均起作用很大。
    全体村干部党员代表，从今年的征收中深深体验到了什么是群众路线，及只有以群众路线的工作方法，才能顺利完成各项工作任务，得到群众的拥护。在起初传达秋征任务时，有部分村干部及党员，对以走群众路线的方法完成秋征任务的信心很低，觉得任务与政策很难一致起来。个别村干部仍认为：只要是向群众要东西，群众绝对不会高兴；要想按时完成任务，就得带点强迫性。但在实际工作中，都亲自尝到了这一点：只要耐心宣传，讲清政策和道理，以自己的积极模范带头作用，带动群众，是会很快按政策完成任务的；群众是会高兴的。直到征收基本结束，各村均未发现任何与群众闹态度、强迫群众交粮的事情。一区城关小区七街中共支书梁丑妮（女），在以往工作中经常向群众耍态度，张嘴就扣起来，抿嘴就罚。这回在征收中，她也深深地体会到只有耐心解释讲明道理，强迫命令是解决不了问题的。同时在这次秋征中涌现了不少模范支部、及模范党、团员、干部等。村干部的工作情绪空前提高，过去认为当干部得罪人的思想，也自行消散了，争取模范干部的空气却日益浓厚了。
