　　Tsinghua University Electrical Engineering Department Propaganda Team
    Arrives at Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant
    [This newspaper's report] The propaganda team of over two hundred and ten people from the Electrical Engineering Department of Tsinghua University arrived at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant on the 15th at noon. As the trucks approached the factory, chimneys belching thick smoke and newly dug air-raid shelters simultaneously appeared before the students. One student said indignantly, "Seeing the iron and steel plant reminds me of the Northeast, where industry has reached 35%. Damn it, the enemy is hindering our peaceful construction in this way, forcing us to dig so many air-raid shelters!"
    Inside the factory, there were big-character posters everywhere, writing: "Turn the workshop into a battlefield, the machines into weapons," "Guarantee to stick to our posts under any circumstances, eliminate work-related injuries and accidents due to negligence, and resist America and aid Korea with practical actions to step up production," and other letters of challenge. These scenes moved the students greatly, and they were determined to do a good job in propaganda work. A certain squad of the second-year electrical engineering students, just after getting off the truck, challenged all the students with a small blackboard, guaranteeing to achieve "Obey all commands," "Not afraid of getting dirty, not afraid of hardship, no running around, no asking unnecessary questions, no emotional outbursts," and other eight points of attention.
    In the afternoon, as soon as they had arranged their bedding, the students began intensive preparations. "The Song of General Kim Il-sung" was quickly sung in unison in the staff and workers' children's school and the spare-time school, spreading widely.
    In the evening, the trade union cadres held a welcome meeting for the students in the auditorium. After the meeting, the students were divided into groups to exchange information with the responsible comrades of each workshop, discuss work, and prepare to go to the workshop the next day. Everyone was in high spirits, chatting endlessly.
    The groups were assigned and the plans were set on the same day. The propaganda team is expected to work in Shijingshan for two weeks. (Xin)

　　清华电机系宣传队
    到达石景山钢铁厂
    【本报讯】清华电机系宣传队二百一十余人，在十五日中午，到达石景山钢铁厂。当卡车驰近工厂时，冒着浓烟的烟囱和新挖的防空壕同时出现在同学们眼前。一个同学愤慨地说：“看到钢铁厂，使我想到工业已达百分之三十五的东北，他妈的，敌人就是这样子阻挠我们的和平建设的，它硬要迫得我们掘这许多防空壕！”
    厂内，到处有大字报，写着：“把工场变成战场，机器变成武器”、“保证任何情况下坚守岗位，消灭公伤与责任事故，以加紧生产的实际行动抗美援朝”等挑战书。这些情景使同学们很激动，都决心要把宣传工作搞好。电二某小队刚下卡车，就用小黑板向全体同学挑战，保证做到“一切行动听指挥”、“不怕脏，不怕苦，不乱跑，不乱问，不闹情绪”、“虚心向工人同志学习”等八项注意。
    下午刚把铺盖弄好，同学们就展开了紧张的准备工作。“金日成将军之歌”很快地在职工子弟学校和业余学校齐唱起来，传播开去。
    晚上，工会干部在礼堂举行了对同学的欢迎会。会后同学分成小组与各车间负责同志交换情况，讨论工作，准备次日到车间去。大家情绪极高，彼此扯住谈个不休。
    当天小组已分好，计划已定出。该宣传队预计将在石景山工作两星期。  （信）
