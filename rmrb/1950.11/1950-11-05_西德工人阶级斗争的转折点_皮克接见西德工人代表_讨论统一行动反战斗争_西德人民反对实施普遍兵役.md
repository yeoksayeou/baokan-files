　　A Turning Point in the West German Working Class Struggle
    Pieck Receives West German Worker Representatives
    Discusses Unified Action Against War
    West German People Oppose Implementation of Universal Conscription
    [Xinhua News Agency, 4th] According to a report from the German News Agency in Berlin: Just as the United States is recklessly remilitarizing West Germany to accelerate preparations for launching a war, over 600 Social Democratic Party members and trade union cadres from West Germany, along with 150 non-party and Christian trade union members, traveled to Berlin in late October to meet with Wilhelm Pieck and Walter Ulbricht, chairmen of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED), and held a meeting to discuss unified action by the West German working class.
    Chairman Pieck, at this meeting, answered questions raised by West German working-class cadres concerning how to fight against war. He pointed out: "The most urgent task for all friends of peace at present is to unite, resolutely subordinate all political and ideological differences in the face of common danger, and organize peace committees in every household and every factory, because only organized strength can guarantee victory." The meeting was conducted in a spirit of absolute frankness, mutual trust, and mutual criticism and self-criticism. Every question raised by the West German working-class cadres was answered solemnly by Pieck and Ulbricht.
    The SED's central organ, *Neues Deutschland*, pointed out: "This first unified action representative meeting is a turning point in the West German working class struggle." "If the existing good start can be correctly and consistently implemented, then this struggle will lead to the unification of actions of all patriotic forces and guarantee the victory of the democratic unification of all Germany."
    [Xinhua News Agency] TASS, Berlin, 27th: News is received here daily indicating that the Western occupation authorities, in violation of the Potsdam Agreement of the Great Powers, are remilitarizing West Germany. According to a report in the *Stuttgarter Nachrichten*: The puppet Prime Minister Adenauer is preparing to implement universal conscription in West Germany.
    The report pointed out: During the negotiations between U.S. General Hays and an "Adenauer expert," an agreement was reached to organize West German mercenary forces, stipulating that these forces must participate in the aggressive so-called "Army of Western Europe." It is expected that Adenauer will promulgate a conscription bill in West Germany in order to obtain manpower for organizing ten divisions. The report also pointed out that Adenauer has undertaken to hand over 200,000 "extremely valuable human resources" to the Americans.
    The *Frankfurter Rundschau*, commenting on these negotiations, stated that even if enough officers could be recruited in West Germany, it would not be possible to recruit soldiers "at will." The report stated: "Therefore, the law on universal conscription is being stipulated in advance for this reason." The report pointed out that future mercenaries will include engineers, tank divisions, and motorized infantry.
    According to the *German News Agency*: After the West German newspapers published this secret news, Adenauer's staff were greatly stimulated. They threatened to interrogate the *Frankfurter Rundschau* reporter, intending to find out from him which senior official in the Federal Chancellor's office enabled him to obtain information about the draft universal conscription bill.
    According to the *German News Agency*: The report on the proposed implementation of conscription has been confirmed by the British representative in the Allied High Commission. This representative said that Adenauer's military advisor, Schwerin, has already reviewed the technical issues pertaining to the implementation of universal conscription.
    Regarding the Bonn puppet "government's" preparation of a conscription bill, the *Süddeutsche Zeitung* pointed out that the time limits for conducting registration and preparing barracks for the recruited soldiers have already been set.
    The remilitarization of West Germany is encountering increasing opposition from the West German people. Even the U.S. authorities have been forced to acknowledge this fact. According to a report in the *Nürnberger Nachrichten*: Stone, the Deputy Director of the Information and Cultural Relations Office of the U.S. Department of the Allied High Commission, stated: The anti-war sentiment of the German people has deeply impressed us.

　　西德工人阶级斗争的转折点
    皮克接见西德工人代表
    讨论统一行动反战斗争
    西德人民反对实施普遍兵役
    【新华社四日讯】据电通社柏林讯：正当美国已在不顾一切地将西德重新军国主义化，以加紧准备发动战争的时候，西德六百余名社会民主党党员及工会干部和一百五十名无党派及基督教徒工会分子，在十月下旬赴柏林会晤了德国统一社会党主席皮克和格罗提渥，并举行了讨论西德工人阶级统一行动的会议。
    皮克主席在这次会议上答复了西德工人阶级干部所提出的关于应如何进行斗争反对战争的问题。他指出：“目前所有爱好和平的朋友最迫切的任务，就是团结一致，在共同的危险面前，坚决地把一切政治上和思想上的歧见置于次要地位，在每一户人家，每一个工厂里组织和平委员会，因为只有有组织的力量才能保证胜利。”会议是在绝对坦白、相互信任和彼此展开批评与自我批评的精神下进行的。西德工人阶级干部所提出的每一个问题，都得到皮克和格罗提渥郑重的答复。
    统一社会党中央机关报《新德意志报》指出：“这个第一次统一行动代表会议，乃是西德工人阶级斗争的一个转折点。”“现有的良好开始如能正确地、始终不渝地贯彻下去，那末，这个斗争便将导致一切爱国力量行动的统一，并保证全德民主统一的胜利。”
    【新华社讯】塔斯社柏林二十七日电：此间每天接到消息，表明西方占领当局违反大国波茨坦协定，正在使西德重新军国主义化。据《斯图加特新闻报》报道：傀儡总理阿登纳正在准备在西德实施普遍的兵役。
    该报指出：在美国将军海斯和一个“阿登纳的专家”谈判的期间，已经成立了一个组织西德雇佣军的协定，规定这种军队必须参加侵略性的所谓“西欧的军队”。预期阿登纳将要在西德颁布兵役法案，以便获得组织十个师团的人力。该报并指出：阿登纳已经承担将二十万“非常宝贵的人力资源”交由美国人支配。
    《法兰克福论坛报》论及这些谈判时称：即使在西德可以征募足够的军官，也不可能“随意地”征募士兵。该报称：“所以要预先规定颁布普遍兵役的法案，便是为了这个缘故。”该报指出：将来的佣兵将要包括工兵和坦克师团以及摩托化步兵。
    据《德意志通讯社》报道：西德报纸发表了这一个秘密的消息以后，阿登纳系的人员受到莫大的刺激。他们恫吓着要审讯《法兰克福论坛报》这一个记者，打算从他的口中知道在联邦总理的办公厅中那一位高级官吏使他能够得到关于普遍兵役的草案的消息。
    据《德意志通讯社》消息：关于提出的实行征兵的报告，已经由盟国高级专员公署中英国代表所确认。这一位代表说：阿登纳的军事顾问许威林已经审核了属于实施普遍兵役的技术问题。
    关于波恩傀儡“政府”准备征兵法案一事，《南德日报》指出：进行登记和为征募的兵士准备兵营的时限已经规定了。
    使西德重新军国主义化一事遭遇到西德人民日甚一日的反对。甚至美国当局也被迫承认了这一件事实。据《纽伦堡新闻报》消息：盟国高级专员公署美国部情报与文化关系处的副处长斯托恩称：德国人反战的情绪，已经给与我们深刻的印象了。
