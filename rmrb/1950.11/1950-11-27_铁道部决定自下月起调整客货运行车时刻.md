　　Ministry of Railways Decides to Adjust Passenger and Freight Train Schedules Starting Next Month
    [Xinhua News Agency, 25th] The Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government has decided to adjust the schedules of passenger and freight trains nationwide starting December 1st, and uniformly implement a new winter train schedule. According to the new train operation schedule, the number of passenger train pairs operated by each bureau will be roughly the same as at present, and the travel time of each passenger train will be generally shortened. The total travel time for the direct express train from Shanghai to Guangzhou will be reduced to 55 hours and 42 minutes, a reduction of 6 hours and 33 minutes compared to the previous time. The total travel time for the direct express train from Beijing to Hankou will be reduced to 37 hours and 46 minutes, a reduction of 3 hours and 33 minutes compared to the previous time. The total travel time for the direct express train from Beijing to Shanghai will be reduced to 36 hours and 27 minutes, a reduction of 21 minutes compared to the previous time. The connection time between passenger trains will also be shortened. To facilitate passenger travel, the departure times of major passenger trains in major cities are set after people wake up, and the arrival times are set before people go to sleep. As for freight trains, they will be operated directly as much as possible according to actual needs. The Ministry of Railways' adjustment of train schedules this time is not only to adapt to the severe cold of the winter climate and the seasonal changes of short days and long nights, but also mainly because the work efficiency of various tasks has been improved since the schedule change this summer.

　　铁道部决定自下月起调整客货运行车时刻
    【新华社二十五日讯】中央人民政府铁道部决定自十二月一日起调整全国客货列车行车时刻，统一实行新的冬季行车时刻。按照新的列车运转时刻，各局旅客列车开行对数大致与目前相同，各次旅客列车旅行时间则普遍缩短。上海到广州直达快车全程时间减至五十五小时四十二分，较前缩短六小时三十三分。北京到汉口直达快车全程时间减至三十七小时四十六分，较前缩短三小时三十三分。北京到上海直达快车全程时间减至三十六小时二十七分，较前缩短二十一分。各次旅客列车的相互衔接时间也较前缩短。为便利旅客搭乘，各大城市各次主要旅客列车开出时间均定在起床以后，到达时间定在睡觉以前。至于货物列车，则按照实际需要，尽可能直达开行。按铁道部此次调整行车时刻，不仅是为适应冬季气候严寒及昼短夜长的季节变化，而且主要的还由于今年夏季改点以来各项工作效率均已提高。
