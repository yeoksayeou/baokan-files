Xinhua News Agency, Jingxi, Guangxi, 23rd. This reporter reports on the detailed process of French aircraft invading our country's airspace and indiscriminately bombing Tianbao City, stating: The Double Ninth Festival on the ninth day of the ninth lunar month (i.e., October 19th) happened to be Tianbao City's market day. Nearby farmers, rejoicing in the first abundant autumn harvest since liberation, flocked to the market to buy wine and meat for the festival. Farmers from Longguang, Yandong, Xingwang and other villages south of the city carried local products such as grain, anise oil, and star anise to the city. The bustling crowds made Tianbao County very lively. As the market dispersed in the afternoon, at 3:20 pm local time, four French aircraft suddenly flew in from the south, two in front and two behind. Upon reaching the airspace above Tianbao County, the French aircraft strafed the streets, riverbanks, and the foot of Yunshan Mountain. Then, they swooped down and continuously dropped bombs weighing from one hundred to five hundred pounds. The explosions shook the entire Tianbao City like a landslide.

According to this reporter's investigation, the French aircraft dropped a total of six bombs, one of which landed directly on the large stone bridge over the Lanshui River. The bridge, about one zhang wide and ten zhang long, was the main thoroughfare to the villages south of the city. When the stone bridge was hit, it was crowded with farmers fleeing south in terror, and more than twenty people were killed in the river at that time. Because the victims were all farmers from nearby villages, their names are currently being investigated. Three bombs landed on Nanlong Street along the river, and more than a hundred residential houses were bombed and damaged. One of the bombs landed on Tan Qixiang's noodle shop, killing five of the seven members of the Tan family. The eighty-year-old grandmother, Tan Huangshi, was completely shattered by the bomb; the five-year-old grandson, Shun Jue, had his entire head blown off; the son, Wei Xian, the daughter, Feng He, and the daughter-in-law, Tan Nongshi, were all buried in the rubble, leaving only the sixty-year-old Tan Luo and another grandson. Tan Jia Ti, a farmer from Fuchao Village, and Huang Deng Shuang, a farmer from Hanting Village, who were eating noodles in the shop, were also killed. The house of Huang Zirong, Tan's neighbor, was completely destroyed, and Huang himself was injured, and his daughter, Rui Ying, was crushed to death by the collapsed bricks and tiles. Most of Yi Yingjie's house, opposite Tan's, was destroyed, and Yi's mother, Li, was also crushed to death. One bomb landed in the backyard of Li Yuhui on that street, creating a crater about two zhang in diameter. Most of Li's house was destroyed, and Li himself suffered injuries to his head, abdomen, and limbs. One bomb landed in Liang Shengmo's vegetable garden on that street, creating a crater five or six feet in diameter, but fortunately no one was injured. Another bomb landed in the river, and shrapnel injured the young man Huang Xuan, who was on the shore; the seven-year-old girl Huang Meise was also hit by shrapnel through her chest, her right foot was broken, and she fell into the river and died. In addition, another bomb landed in a field on the opposite bank of the river. In this air raid, the unfortunate victims who were killed or injured also included Li Ganyu (dead), Li Fang, Li Huisun, Huang Anji, Nong Qing, Ms. Tan, Zheng Jiyu, Yi Xiaojiao, A Ni, Huang Jingye's mother, Ms. Liu, Tan Tingzha, and Su Shengli, among others.

When the French aircraft attacked, the People's Liberation Army garrisoned in the city immediately took action to maintain order. After the French aircraft fled, more than a hundred representatives from the city's Party, government, military organs, people's organizations, students, and citizens rushed to the affected areas to rescue and excavate. The People's Government sent the injured to the hospital for treatment, bought coffins for the dead and buried them, and offered condolences to the families of the victims. The people of the city were extremely resentful of the provocative crimes of the French invading Vietnamese army aircraft for violating our country's airspace and indiscriminately bombing Tianbao City. They all said: This is an irreconcilable hatred, and blood debts will one day be repaid in double.

    法机滥炸广西天保城详情
    【新华社广西靖西二十三日电】本社记者报道法机侵犯我国领空并滥炸天保城的详细经过称：旧历九月初九（即十月十九日）重阳节，天保城恰逢墟日（即集日），附近农民庆幸解放后第一季秋禾丰收，纷纷赶街打酒买肉过节。城南龙光、燕峒、兴旺等乡农民都肩挑着粮食、茴油、八角等土产到城里来，熙来攘往的人群，使天保县城非常热闹。下午散墟时，当地时间三时二十分，突然从南面飞来法国飞机四架，两架在前，两架在后。飞至天保县城上空，法机就向街上、河边和云山脚下扫射；接着又俯冲而下，连续投掷一百磅至五百磅重的炸弹，爆炸声像山崩地裂般震撼了整个天保城。
    据记者调查，法机共投掷炸弹六颗，其中有一颗正落在滥水河大石桥上。该桥宽约一丈，长约十丈，为通城南各乡之孔道。石桥中弹时，桥上正拥挤着向南惊逃的农民，当时被炸死于河中者达二十余人。因遭害者都是远近各乡农民，姓名正在查考中。河畔南隆街落下三弹，居民房屋百余间被炸塌和震坏。其中一弹落在谭奇香粉店，谭家七口人被炸死五口。八十岁的老祖母谭黄氏，尸体全被炸碎；五岁的小孙顺觉，整个头颅被炸掉；儿子维贤、女儿凤和及媳妇谭农氏，一同葬身在砖瓦堆中，现只留下六十多岁的谭罗氏和另一孙儿。在该店吃粉的扶朝村农民谭家提和汉亭村农民黄登双亦被炸死。谭之邻居黄子荣家房屋被全部震塌，黄本人受伤，其女儿瑞英被倒塌的砖瓦压死。谭家对面易英杰房子大半被震塌，易母李氏亦被压死。一弹落在该街李玉辉后院，弹坑直径约二丈，李屋大部炸倒，李本人头部、腹部和手脚均被压伤。一弹落在该街梁盛模家菜园，弹坑直径五、六尺，幸未伤人。又有一弹落在河中，横飞的弹片将正在岸边的青年黄宣炸伤；七岁女孩黄美色也被弹片穿过胸部，右脚骨被炸断，倒下河中死去。此外还有一弹落在河对岸田里。在此次空袭中，不幸被炸以致死伤者尚有李甘玉（死）、李芳、黎惠荪、黄安基、农庆、谭氏、郑继禹、易晓蕉、阿尼、黄敬业之母、刘氏、谭庭楂、苏盛礼等人。
    法机空袭时，人民解放军在该城的驻军立即出动警戒，维持秩序。法机逸去后，城内党政军各机关和人民团体代表及学生、市民共百余人，赶往受害地点抢救、挖掘。人民政府当将伤者抬送医院医治，对死者买棺埋葬，并慰问受害者家属。全城人民对法国侵略越南军队飞机侵犯我国领空并滥炸天保城的挑衅罪行极为愤恨。他们都说：这是不共戴天之仇，血债总有一天要加倍偿还。
