　　Joliot-Curie
　　On the Second World Congress of Advocates for Peace
　　[Xinhua News Agency, London, 13th] According to TASS, London, 12th: Joliot-Curie, Chairman of the World Peace Council, recently wrote in the Workers' Daily that the main consideration of the World Peace Council is to enable as many people as possible with different opinions to express their views. The committee proposed the establishment of several broad committees, each of which should discuss the issues raised in the recent Prague appeal and contribute new ideas to improve it.

　　Joliot-Curie continued: The congress will achieve great success and a wide response. The world peace movement is an extremely powerful force. Those who previously held hostile attitudes have now changed their attitudes and understand that our only purpose is peace.

　　Joliot-Curie pointed out that the congress should ease world tensions and should prove the possibility and necessity of peaceful coexistence between the two major systems in the world. Peace is in the immediate interest of all mankind. A few people in the United States are trying their best to promote war, and even clamor for a "preemptive" war. But the people cannot be deceived forever, especially when someone enlightens them. We must ensure that people know the truth. We must come up with various ways to reach agreements among all ethnic groups (including the American people, who have repeatedly expressed their opposition to war).

　　Our goal is to greatly expand the peace movement and greatly increase understanding. The congress will play an important role in generally easing tensions.

　　约里奥—居里
    论二届世界和大
    【新华社十三日讯】据塔斯社伦敦十二日讯：世界保卫和平委员会主席约里奥—居里，顷在工人日报上撰文称：世界保卫和平委员会主要的考虑，是使尽可能多的持有各种见解的人物来发表他们的意见。委员会提议成立几个广泛的委员会，各委员会都应该讨论最近布拉格号召中所提出的问题，并贡献新的意见，使之臻于完善。
    约里奥—居里继称：大会将获得巨大的成功与广泛的响应。世界和平运动是强大无比的力量。那些从前持敌对态度的人士现在都改变了态度，并了解到我们唯一的目的是和平。
    约里奥—居里指出：大会应该使世界紧张的局势缓和下来，并且应该证明世界上两大制度有和平共存的可能性与必要性。和平是全人类的眼前利益。美国有少数人正在极力想要战争，甚至叫嚣“先发制人”的战争。但是人民是不能永远被欺骗的，特别是有人启示他们的时候。我们要保证使人民晓得真理。我们必须想出各种办法，使各族人民（包括已经多方表示不要战争的美国人民在内）取得协议。
    我们的目的是使和平运动大大扩展并大大增进谅解。大会将要起头等重要的作用，使紧张的局势普遍和缓下来。
