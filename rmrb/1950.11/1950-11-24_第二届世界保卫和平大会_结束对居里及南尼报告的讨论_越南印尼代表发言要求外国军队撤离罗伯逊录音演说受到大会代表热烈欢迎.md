The delegates listened with great enthusiasm to the recorded speech of Robeson, the heroic American peace fighter. In his speech, Robeson emphasized that war is the program of fascists and imperialists, therefore, defending peace is closely linked with the struggle against imperialism and fascism.

Representatives of the people of colonial countries such as Madagascar, Tunisia, Morocco, and the Union of South Africa, accused the crimes of the American, British, and French colonialists to the congress. The Tunisian representative stressed that the Tunisian people will never allow Tunisia to become an imperialist base of aggression.

The Brazilian representative, the famous writer Amado, said that there are already four million peace signatures in Brazil. The representatives of Venezuela, Argentina, and Ecuador said that their people firmly oppose the invasion of U.S. imperialist forces, and declared that they will never be cannon fodder for the United States. The Paraguayan representative displayed the blood-stained clothes of Paraguayan student Aniso, a peace fighter who was shot and killed by the police.

The congress read a letter from Greek peace fighters imprisoned by the Athens government. The letter, written on a small piece of paper and smuggled out of prison, contained warm greetings from the Greek patriots to the peace fighters.

The famous Chilean poet Neruda, as well as the representatives of Italy, Poland, Albania, Austria, Cyprus, Iraq, and Iceland, also spoke at the meeting.
