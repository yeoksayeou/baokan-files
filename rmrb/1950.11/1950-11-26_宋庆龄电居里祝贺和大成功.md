　　Soong Ching-ling Cables Curie
    Congratulating on Great Success
    [Xinhua News Agency, 25th] The World Peace Congress invited 37 prominent figures from all walks of life in our country to attend this year's conference held in Warsaw. However, due to their official duties, the invited individuals from our country were unable to attend. Apart from the 26 people in Beijing who have jointly sent a congratulatory telegram, Soong Ching-ling, Mei Lanfang, Hou Debang, Li Zhuchen, and others who were invited but are not in Beijing, are now successively sending telegrams to Curie, the chairman of the World Peace Congress, to congratulate the success of the conference. The text of Soong Ching-ling's telegram to the Second World Peace Congress is as follows: To Mr. Curie, Warsaw World Peace Congress:
    The Second World Peace Congress, gathering one thousand seven hundred and fifty representatives of the people from eighty countries, has successfully concluded after passing the declaration to the people of the world. I extend my warmest greetings to the conference and to you with boundless enthusiasm.
    Soong Ching-ling
