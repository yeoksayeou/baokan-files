Alexander Gerasimov, President of the State Academy of Arts, delivered the opening speech, stating that the holding of the Chinese Art Exhibition has great political and artistic significance, symbolizing a new development in the friendship between the two major powers of the Soviet Union and China. The exchange of art is a good medium for strengthening the friendship between the people of the Soviet Union and China. He said: Chinese modern art has not been directly affected by formalism, and Chinese artists are embarking on the correct path of realism, using socialist realism as their method of expression. We congratulate the Chinese artists who have embarked on this path and have already achieved success.

Academician Chigodayev of the Academy of Sciences said: We have seen the rapid progress of Chinese new artists, and the old artists are also developing in new directions with their skilled techniques. This fully proves the correctness of the tasks and direction of Chinese art work. Chigodayev highly praised the high skill of Chinese woodcuts in clearly depicting the people's lives and struggles.

The famous painter Nabidjan said: Just as Stalin guides Soviet artists to take the correct path, Mao Zedong leads Chinese artists to advance towards the correct path.
