The Woes of American Warmongers
Lin Dan Qiu Wen Fang Cheng Zhong Ling Cartoon

I: From "Surprise Sickness" to "White Hair Sickness"

According to a dispatch from the United Press reporter in the Korean war zone on the 8th of this month, the people's guerrillas in the enemy-occupied areas of North Korea are "very active," and "crazed suicide squads are roaming the countryside, searching for combat targets." This has caused the American military advisors to "not only fight to preserve their lives, but also to wage a war of nerves." And this "war of nerves" is so intense that "their white hair is increasing day by day."

When Wu Zixu passed Zhaoguan, his beard and eyebrows turned white overnight, which was also the result of waging a "war of nerves." However, the "checkpoint" Wu Zixu encountered was actually just a few hired guards of the State of Chu, so although his "beard and eyebrows turned white," he still got through. But the "checkpoint" that the American invading army is encountering on the Korean battlefield is the tens of millions of "suicide squad" people of Korea, a net of anti-aggression flames. Whether the American military advisors whose "white hair is increasing day by day" can pass this checkpoint, only God knows.

I remember when the American invading army was suffering from "surprise sickness" on the Korean battlefield, it was also when Truman asked God to help him "get through the difficult times," and the "ground force commander" Walker, who was "suffering from lack of sleep," prescribed a remedy: order the soldiers not to think about individual or collective surrenders. Although this prescription was ineffective, it was still a prescription. But today's new patients are not ordinary American soldiers, but American military advisors, and the symptoms are even more serious than "surprise sickness," it is "white hair sickness," and the old prescription is of course not applicable. So what about the new prescription? This should be the time for the Walker, MacArthur, and their ilk to "wage a war of nerves"!

II: "Major General Almond's" "Secret"

Almond, the "person in charge of the entire northeastern region of Korea" in the American invading army, has a secret. He first wants to "attack the guerrillas in the most effective way." What "way"? Look:

First, find experts in fighting guerrillas in the US military around the world, and send them to Korea immediately. Second, establish an assault force with the cavalry of the Tenth Army Corps Headquarters as the core. Third, bring Koreans who oppose communism (author's note: i.e., "Goryeo sticks" and the like) to work in the anti-guerrilla forces. If these "methods" are not effective, the "Major General" will take out the final "secret":

"If a long-term guerrilla war must be conducted in the future, the United Nations Command may borrow guerrilla experts from the United Kingdom. During World War II, a British force fought the Japanese army in Malaya together with the Chinese Communist guerrillas (author's note: There are only Malayan Communist guerrillas in Malaya, and there are no so-called "Chinese Communist guerrillas"). These British learned many secrets from the Communists." (The above materials are from the Associated Press Tokyo dispatch on the 3rd of this month)

The "United Nations Forces" Command needs British guerrilla experts, they can just "recruit" them, why "borrow" them? Let's leave that aside for now. Borrowing British experts who have learned "many secrets" to deal with the Korean people's guerrillas is indeed a "secret" of "using the spear of the son to attack the shield of the son." However, with just a little thought, one will know that this secret is probably not more clever than the above three "most effective methods." Because the most basic material of the "many secrets" of people's guerrilla warfare is the flesh-and-blood connection with the broad masses of the people. Can the American invaders' "assault force" do this? It can be asserted that after those British "experts" are "borrowed" to the Korean battlefield, in addition to "their white hair increasing day by day," there will be no other effect. In fact, these British "experts" command 100,000 British troops in Malaya and attack the Malayan People's Guerrilla, and they are still helpless. How can they save the American army's misfortune in Korea?

III: The "Secret" of the "Columnist"

After the warlords of the big bosses on Wall Street in New York were thwarted in Korea, their strategists at home came up with ideas:

"Columnist Brown wrote in the Washington Star Evening News that to deal with the new situation in Korea, we cannot expect other troops to participate in the war unless we agree to send the ten ready-made divisions of troops from the Chinese government in Taiwan. Under the current world situation, other UN member states are unlikely to provide the UN with any further substantial assistance. The United Kingdom may send a few thousand more people, and Canada may decide to send its fully trained force of 5,000 to Korea. In addition, there are Turkish troops of about 4,500 on their way to Korea." (Kuomintang Central News Agency, Washington, 6th)

The Kuomintang Central News Agency published this news to make shameless boasts for itself. Columnist Brown wrote out the "great expectations" of the American masters for the Chinese remnants.

The American imperialists value these "ten ready-made divisions of troops" very much, because the remnant forces of Chiang Kai-shek in Taiwan are still the "most powerful" allied force of the United States in Asia. At the beginning of the Korean War, Chiang Kai-shek once expressed his intention to "send troops" to Korea, but it did not materialize. Senators Nolan and others are still "accusing" the Achesons of being greatly "mistaken" and "appealing for immediate approval for the Chinese National Army to go to Korea to participate in the war."

It is said that the Achesons are "studying" the "appeals" of the Nolans, and "refuse to express opinions before studying." It seems that this problem is not simple. In fact, these "ten ready-made divisions of troops" are not even a fraction of the more than 8 million bandit troops that have been wiped out by the People's Liberation Army. What's more, "according to officials from the State Department, 'after a large number of Chinese National Army troops leave Taiwan, Taiwan will soon be difficult to resist the invasion of the Communist army, and may encourage the CCP to put more Communist army troops into the Korean War.'" (See the above-mentioned Central News Agency dispatch) So what should be done?

IV: Wedemeyer's "Method"

There are still "methods," but they are mostly old methods. For example, United Press reporter Gonzales sent a telegram from Washington on the 4th of this month, saying that "the United Nations can ask the Chinese Communists to withdraw from the war." However, this request "will undoubtedly incur a veto from the Soviet Union," thus "providing the first opportunity to test the plan initiated by the United States to submit a request to the UN General Assembly without veto power to bypass the Security Council." This plan is to "require the United Nations forces in Korea to repel new aggression (!) for the sake of international peace and security." This coincides with the conversation of the "American officials" reported by the Kuomintang Central News Agency on the 8th of this month. This is a reprint of the plan of the American imperialists to use the name of the United Nations to arm and invade Korea, but one is to "pass" through the Security Council without the participation of the Soviet representative, and the other is to "bypass" the Security Council with the participation of the Soviet representative. Both are aggressive "measures" that trample on the United Nations Charter!

The question is, what to do after "bypassing the Security Council"? Please see the reply from "Chiang Kai-shek's former chief of staff" Wedemeyer:

"Chiang Kai-shek's former chief of staff Wedemeyer believed yesterday that the United States can never overcome the power of China. He said: 'Among the ten million North Koreans, fifteen excellent divisions have been formed, which has caused a lot of trouble for our army. Then how many divisions can be produced among the 450 million Chinese? This superiority of armed forces is worth considering. It is very smart to think that we can never defeat this army.'" (Agence France-Presse, 9th)

What the American imperialists use to scare the people of the world is the "military superiority" that they boast about, including the atomic bomb. However, Wedemeyer said that this "superiority" already belongs to the Chinese people, and it is an "advantage that can never be defeated." Thinking about this is indeed "very smart."

However, don't think that the warmonger Wedemeyer suddenly became "smart" and poured cold water on the "paper tiger" with his own hands. He has another "very smart" way to overcome this "advantage": arm the bandits on the Chinese mainland. But is this method really "very smart"? It didn't work to arm Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang before it collapsed, let alone the remnants!

Let the Trumans pray to God and let God help them "get through the difficult times." "Thanksgiving" is approaching, which is not only a festival that American soldiers on the Korean battlefield "eagerly want" to go back to "celebrate," but also a good opportunity for the White House tycoons to pray.

    美国战争贩子们的苦闷
    林淡  秋文  方成  锺灵漫画
    一：从“吃惊病”到“白发病”
    据美国合众社记者本月八日发自朝鲜战地的电讯，朝鲜敌占区的人民游击队“非常活跃”，“疯狂的敢死队流窜四乡，寻找战斗的目标。”这使得美国军事顾问们“不仅为保全生命而战，而且也在作神经战”。而这“神经战”是那样激烈，以致“他们的白发与日俱增”了。
    伍子胥过昭关，一夜功夫，须眉都变白了，这也是作“神经战”的结果。然而伍子胥所碰到的“关”，其实不过是楚国的几个被雇佣的守卒，所以虽然“须眉皆白”，但到底通过了。而美国侵略军在朝鲜战场上所碰到的“关”，却是朝鲜几千万“敢死”的人民，是天罗地网般的反侵略的火焰。“白发与日俱增”的美国军事顾问们能否过得这一关，却只有上帝知道了。
    记得美国侵略军在朝鲜战场上患“吃惊病”时，也正是杜鲁门请求上帝帮助其“度过困难的时期”时，“睡眠不足”的“地面部队司令官”瓦克曾开过一个药方：命令士兵不要想到个别投降或集体投降。这个药方虽然无效，总算开出了一个药方。而今天的新病人却不是普通的美国兵，而是美国军事顾问们，病症又是比“吃惊病”更加严重的“白发病”，老药方当然不适用了。那么新药方呢？这该是瓦克、麦克阿瑟之流“作神经战”的时候了！
    二：“阿尔梦德少将”的“秘诀”
    美国侵略军在“全朝鲜东北地区的负责人”阿尔梦德有一个秘诀。他首先要“以最有效的办法攻打游击队”。什么“办法”呢？看吧：
    第一，在世界的美军中寻找打游击的专家，并立即把他们送往朝鲜。第二，以第十兵团司令部的骑兵队为核心，建立一支攻击部队。第三，把反对共产党的朝鲜人（作者按：即“高丽棒子”之流）弄到反游击队的部队中来工作。如果这些“办法”都不见效，“少将”便要拿出最后的“秘诀”来：
    “如果以后必须进行长期游击战，联合国部队指挥部可能向英国商借游击专家。第二次世界大战时，英国有一支部队曾同中共游击队（作者按：在马来亚只有马共游击队，并无所谓“中共游击队”。）一起在马来亚与日军作战。这些英国人从共军那里学到许多秘诀。”（以上材料均见美联社东京本月三日电）
    “联合国部队”的指挥部需要英国游击专家，只要“征召”就得了，何必“商借”呢？这暂不去说它。商借已学到“许多秘诀”的英国专家来对付朝鲜人民的游击队，这到底不失为“以子之矛，攻子之盾”的“秘诀”。然而只要稍一思索，就会知道这个秘诀未必比上述三个“最有效的办法”更高明。因为人民游击战争“许多秘诀”的最基本物质，便是与广大人民的血肉联系。美国侵略者的“攻击部队”做得到这一点吗？可以断言：那些英国“专家”被“商借”到朝鲜战场之后，除了“他们的白发与日俱增”之外，是不会有别的效果的。事实上，这些英国“专家”们在马来亚指挥十万英军，进攻马来亚人民游击队，尚且毫无办法，他们又怎能救美军在朝鲜的厄运呢？
    三：“专栏作家”的“秘诀”
    纽约华尔街的大老板们的武将在朝鲜碰壁之后，他们在国内的谋臣又来献策了：
    “专栏作家布朗于华盛顿明星晚报撰文称：应付韩境的新局势，我们不能预期其他军队参战，除非同意由台湾的中国政府派出他们准备好的十师部队。在目前世界局势下，其他联合国会员国殊少可能予联合国以任何进一步的可观协助。英国可能再派数千人，加拿大可能决定将自己完成训练的部队五千人派韩。此外尚有土国军队约四千五百人在开韩途中。”（国民党中央社华盛顿六日电）
    国民党中央社发布这个消息的用意，在于替自己作厚颜无耻的吹嘘。专栏作家布朗写出了美国主子们对中国残余匪帮的“厚望”。
    对于这“准备好的十师部队”，美帝国主义是很器重的，因为，台湾蒋介石的残余势力，现在还是美帝在亚洲“最强大”的同盟军。朝战初期，蒋介石曾经表示要“出兵”朝鲜，后来没有成为事实。参议员诺兰之流还在“指责”艾奇逊们大为“失策”，而“吁请即时同意中国国军赴韩参战”。
    据说艾奇逊们正在“研究”诺兰们的“呼吁”，而且在“研究前拒绝表示意见”。似乎这个问题并不简单。其实，这“准备好的十师部队”，对于已被解放军消灭的八百多万匪军来说，还不够一个零头。何况“据国务院官员传称”，“大量中国国军开出台湾后，台湾即将难于抵制共军入侵，且可能鼓励中共以更多共军投入韩战。”（见上述中央社电）那么到底怎么办呢？
    四：魏德迈的“办法”
    “办法”还是有的，不过大都是老办法。例如合众社记者贡扎尔斯在本月四日从华盛顿发出一个电讯，说“联合国能够要求中国共产党人退出战争”。然而这一要求“无疑地将要招致苏联的否决”，因而“也就提供第一个机会，考验美国所发起的、向不用否决权的联大提出要求而绕过安理会的计划”。这个计划就是“要求在朝鲜的联合国部队为了国际和平与安全来击退新的侵略（！）”。这与国民党中央社所报道的本月八日“美国官员”的谈话不谋而合。这是美帝盗用联合国名义武装侵略朝鲜的计划的再版，不过一是“通过”没有苏联代表参加的安理会，一是“绕过”有苏联代表参加的安理会，二者都是践踏联合国宪章的侵略“措施”！
    问题在于“绕过安理会”之后又怎么办呢？请看“蒋介石前参谋长”魏德迈的答复吧：
    “蒋介石前参谋长魏德迈昨日认为美国永远不能克服中国的威力。他说：‘在一千万北朝鲜人中，组成了十五个优良的师团，这就给我们的军队造成许多麻烦。那么在四亿五千万中国人中可以产生多少师团呢？这种武装力量的优势是值得考虑的。想一想我们永远不能挫败这支军队，是十分聪明的。’”（法国新闻社九日电）
    美帝用以吓唬全世界人民的，就是他自吹自擂的、包括原子弹在内的“军事的优势”，然而魏德迈却说这种“优势”已经属于中国人民了，而且是“永远不能挫败的优势”。想一想这个，的确是“十分聪明”的。
    然而你不要以为战争贩子魏德迈突然“聪明”起来，亲手泼“纸老虎”的冷水。他另有一个克服这种“优势”的“十分聪明”的办法：武装中国大陆上的匪徒。然而这个办法真是“十分聪明”的吗？过去武装尚未溃败的蒋介石匪帮都不行，何况残匪！
    让杜鲁门们去祷告上帝吧，让上帝帮助他们“度过困难的时期”吧。“感恩节”近了，这不但是朝鲜战场上美国兵“急想”回去“欢度”的节日，也是白宫大亨们祷告的好机会。
