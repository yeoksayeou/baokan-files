Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, November 22nd: Compatriots in Andong, Ji'an, Kuandian and other places who suffered from bombing and strafing by the US Air Force earlier this month have been properly resettled by the local People's Government. Zhu Changsheng, a farmer from Jiancun Village, Xia Aihe, Andong City, who was shot and wounded by a US plane on the 6th of this month, underwent surgery overnight at Andong Municipal Hospital to remove the bullet from his body. His wound is now gradually healing. Of the five people injured in Changxing Street on the 8th, except for Lin Junzhu who is still in the hospital for treatment, the other four suffered minor injuries and have returned home to recuperate after being bandaged. Although Lin Junzhu's right leg fracture has been set, he still needs one or two months of recuperation before he can recover. The house of the victim Lin Jiwei was bombed and destroyed, and the Municipal People's Government has made proper arrangements for him to resettle in a new house. The four residents who were injured in the bombing of Andong Airport on the 9th have been discharged from the hospital after treatment. Yu Xiuting, a farmer who was killed by a US plane in Huashudianzi Village, Ji'an County on the 3rd, has been properly buried.

On the 9th of this month, when US planes bombed Changdianhekou Village in Kuandian County, a large number of houses were destroyed. The local People's Government has organized manpower and materials from nearby villages to help those who were severely affected to move to live in nearby villages, and is actively helping those who were less affected to repair their destroyed houses.

    当地政府妥予安置
    【新华社沈阳二十二日电】本月上旬安东、辑安、宽甸等地被美国空军炸射而受难的同胞已获得当地人民政府妥善安置。本月六日在安东市下叆河尖村被美机射伤的农民朱长胜经安东市立医院医生连夜为其施行手术取出体内弹头后，现创口已渐痊愈。八日在长兴街被炸伤的五人中，除林钧珠尚在医院治疗外，其余四人伤势较轻，经包扎后已回家休养。林钧珠右腿折断虽已接好，但尚需一、二月疗养始能复原。受害居民林基伟之房屋被炸坏，已由市人民政府为其妥善安置新居。九日在安东机场被炸受伤的四名居民经治疗后已出院。三日在辑安县桦树甸子村被美机打死的农民于秀庭已妥为安葬。
    本月九日美机轰炸宽甸县长甸河口村时，曾有大批民房被毁，当地人民政府已组织附近村屯的人力、物力，帮助受害较重者迁移至附近各村居住，对受害较轻者则正积极帮助其修复被毁之房屋。
