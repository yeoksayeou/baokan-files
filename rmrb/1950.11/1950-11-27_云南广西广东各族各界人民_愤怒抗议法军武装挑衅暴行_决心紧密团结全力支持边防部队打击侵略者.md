　　People of All Ethnic Groups in Yunnan, Guangxi, and Guangdong Provinces
    Angrily Protest Armed Provocations and Atrocities by French Troops  
    Determined to Unite Closely and Fully Support Border Troops in Striking Back Against the Aggressors
    [Our Newspaper] According to Xinhua News Agency reports: The people of Yunnan, Guangxi, and Guangdong provinces, bordering Vietnam, have expressed their outrage and protest against the armed provocations by French imperialism. They have also stated their firm support for the statement issued by our Foreign Ministry Spokesperson and are determined to unite closely to deliver a severe blow to the provocateurs.

    People's organizations in Yunnan Province and Kunming City have issued statements or held discussions, unanimously believing that the provocative actions of French imperialism are not accidental but a result of their consistent hostility towards the Chinese people. Zhang Yingcai and thirteen other combat heroes and model workers, who had just returned to Kunming from Beijing, expressed their determination to defend the border and be ready to chop off the bloody hands of French imperialism. Representatives of various ethnic groups from Yunnan, who are currently in Chongqing as part of the Southwest Nationalities National Day Celebration Delegation, have recounted the long-standing atrocities of French imperialism and expressed their resolute protest against the crimes committed by French imperialism in continuously carrying out armed provocations against us on the Sino-Vietnamese border over the past year. Ma Bo'an, a Hui representative and deputy head of the delegation, said: "The French imperialists who occupy Vietnam have long attempted to invade our country. In the past, they built the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway and opened the Banque de l'Indochine in our Yunnan, plundering Yunnan's abundant resources. After the liberation of Yunnan, French imperialism sheltered the Kuomintang bandit troops who fled into Vietnam and supplied them with military supplies to infiltrate and harass our Yunnan border. Now, French imperialism is directly killing our people on the Sino-Vietnamese border, proving that French imperialism is the same as American imperialism in essence. The people of all ethnic groups in Yunnan will unite under the banner of Chairman Mao and rise up together to fight back against the aggressive crimes of French imperialism." Zhao Cunxin, a 僰 [Bu] ethnic representative and deputy county head of the Cheli County People's Government in Yunnan, recounted the facts of French imperialism's invasion of Xishuangbanna in 1946 (a gathering place for ethnic minorities in southern Yunnan, namely Cheli, Fo Hai, and Lancang areas), robbing cattle and horses, raping women, and oppressing and insulting various ethnic groups. He angrily said: "We will never forget these blood debts. Now that we have Chairman Mao and have gained enlightenment, we will definitely mobilize the people of all ethnic groups when we return to our hometown to cooperate with the People's Liberation Army to defend the border." Dao Shixun, currently serving as the Pacification Commissioner of Xishuangbanna, Xiao Zisheng, a Kawa ethnic representative from Lancang County, Dao Shifang, deputy director of the Women's Federation of Fo Hai County, Zhou Jiang of the Min ethnic group, Li Mingsheng of the Akha ethnic group, Su Liya of the Puman ethnic group, and Feng Yuqing of the 僰 [Bu] ethnic group, all pointed out: Yunnan is located on the border, and imperialists have infiltrated our country under the guise of missionaries to carry out espionage activities and sow discord among ethnic groups. They called on the people of all ethnic groups to unite and smash all the conspiracies of imperialism.

    The preparatory committee of the Guangxi Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, the work committee of the Communist Youth League, the Peasants' Association, and the preparatory committee of the Democratic Women's Federation, and other people's organizations, jointly issued a statement on the 24th stating: The people of Guangxi province are extremely angry at this act of aggression by French imperialism, which is hostile to the Chinese people. We firmly support the strong protest lodged by our Foreign Ministry to the French government and reserve all rights to claim compensation for losses and other demands. The joint statement called on workers, peasants, youth, and women throughout Guangxi province to be vigilant, unite closely, and resolutely defend the border.

    The South China Working Committee of the Communist Youth League, the Guangdong Provincial Working Committee of the Communist Youth League, the preparatory committee of the Guangdong Provincial Democratic Youth Federation, and the Guangdong Provincial Student Federation said in a joint statement: The young people and students of Guangdong, standing on the front lines of national defense, will absolutely not allow the savage hooves of the French aggressors to cross one step over our sacred Guangdong and national territory. The written statements from the preparatory committee of the Guangdong Provincial Federation of Trade Unions and the preparatory committee of the Guangzhou Municipal Federation of Trade Unions pointed out: If the land and air forces of French imperialism dare to invade our territory and airspace again, we will fully support our heroic border defense forces and give them a severe blow. The Guangdong Provincial Peasants' Association, the preparatory committee of the Guangdong Provincial Democratic Women's Federation, the preparatory committee of the Guangzhou Municipal Democratic Women's Federation, the Guangzhou Municipal Student Federation, and the Guangzhou Municipal Working Committee of the Communist Youth League also issued statements, pointing out that the people of Guangdong cannot tolerate the French imperialists' increasingly serious armed provocations against our country.

    【本报讯】据新华社讯：与越南接壤的云南、广西、广东三省人民，对法帝武装挑衅，纷纷发出愤怒的抗议，并表示坚决拥护我外交部发言人的声明，紧密团结起来，给挑衅者以严厉回击。
    云南省和昆明市各人民团体都发表了声明或谈话，一致认为法帝的挑衅行为不是偶然的，是一贯与中国人民为敌的结果。刚从北京返回昆明的张英才等十三位战斗英雄和模范工作者表示坚守边疆，准备斩断法帝侵犯的血手。现在重庆的西南各民族庆祝国庆代表团的云南各民族代表，纷纷申诉法帝长期侵略的暴行，对一年来法帝在中越边境连续对我武装挑衅的罪行，表示坚决抗议。代表团副团长回族代表马伯安说：“侵占越南的法帝国主义者，很早以前就企图侵略我国，过去曾在我云南境内修筑滇越铁路，开设东方会理银行，掠夺云南的丰富资源。云南解放后，法帝国主义却包庇逃入越南的国民党匪军，并以军火接济他们潜入我云南边界滋扰。现在法帝国主义又直接在中越边境屠杀我国人民，证明法帝国主义与美帝国主义在本质上是一样的。云南各民族人民将团结在毛主席的旗帜下，一致奋起回击法帝国主义的侵略罪行。”僰族代表、云南车里县人民政府副县长召存信叙述了一九四六年法帝国主义侵略十二版纳（为云南南部少数民族聚居地区，即车里、佛海、澜沧一带），抢劫牛马，奸淫妇女，压迫和侮辱各民族的事实。他愤怒地说：“我们永也不会忘记这些血债，现在我们有了毛主席，得到了光明，我们回到本地一定发动各民族人民，配合解放军保卫边疆。”现担任十二版纳宣慰使的刀世勋、澜沧县卡瓦族代表萧子生、佛海县妇联副主任刀世芳、民家族周江、阿卡族李明生、蒲满族苏里亚及僰族俸郁清等都指出：云南地处边境，帝国主义者以传教为名，潜入我国境内，进行特务活动，挑拨各民族间的团结。他们号召各民族人民，一定要团结起来，粉碎帝国主义的各种阴谋。
    广西省总工会筹备会、青年团工委会、农民协会、民主妇联筹备会等人民团体，于二十四日联合发表声明称：广西全省人民对于法帝国主义这种与中国人民为敌的侵略行为，极为愤怒。我们坚决拥护我外交部向法国政府提出的严重抗议，并保留提出赔偿损失以及其他要求的一切权利。该联合声明号召广西全省工人、农民、青年、妇女，提高警惕，紧密团结，坚决保卫边疆。
    青年团华南工作委员会、青年团广东省工作委员会、广东省民主青联筹备会、广东省学生联合会在发表的联合声明中说：站在国防前线的广东青年和学生，绝对不容许法国侵略者的兽蹄跨越我们神圣的广东和祖国领土一步。广东省总工会筹备会、广州市总工会筹备会的书面谈话中指出：如果法帝国主义的陆空部队敢于再次侵犯我国的领土、领空，我们将全力支持我英勇的边疆防守部队，予以严厉回击。广东省农民协会、广东省民主妇女联合会筹备会、广州市民主妇女联合会筹备会、广州市学生联合会、青年团广州市工作委员会亦分别发表声明，指出法帝对我国日益加甚的武装挑衅，广东人民是不能容忍的。
