　　Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association
    Warmly Welcomes the October Revolution Day

    [Reported by this newspaper] To celebrate the 33rd anniversary of the Soviet October Revolution Day, the Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association has actively launched various propaganda activities in conjunction with the current movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea to protect our homes and defend the country. On the evening of the 5th, the association broadcast Ai Siqi's article "Learning from the Soviet Union's Internationalism and Patriotism" during the "Voice of Sino-Soviet Friendship" program. On the 7th, it will separately hold: (1) A celebration with the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Headquarters at the Youth Palace, where Li Jishen, Zhang Lan, Peng Zhen, and Ambassador Roschin will speak, and the Central Conservatory of Music will perform celebratory programs; (2) A city-wide workers' celebration rally with the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions at the Working People's Cultural Palace; (3) A lecture at No. 19 Nanheyan Street with the Soviet Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, where Soviet Filippov will speak on "The 33rd Anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution."

    At the same time, the Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association will jointly dispatch five propaganda vehicles with the headquarters from the 7th to the 9th to carry out propaganda activities such as film screenings, broadcasts, record playing, and picture displays in the city and suburbs.

    The association has also produced a set of Soviet October Revolution pictures, totaling forty-two, which have been on display in rotation at the reading rooms of the association's branch offices in various districts since the 2nd. The association's journal "Beijing Friendship Association" has also published a special issue titled "Celebrating the 33rd Anniversary of the Soviet October Revolution Day, Resisting US Aggression and Aiding Korea to Protect Our Homes and Defend the Country," and has also published two pamphlets ("On the October Revolution" and the propaganda study manual "Smash the US Imperialist Plot to Expand the War of Aggression!"), through which members can further understand the significance of the Soviet October Revolution and its relationship to the Chinese revolution, and further deepen their hatred, contempt, and disdain for US imperialism.

    【本报讯】为庆祝苏联十月革命节三十三周年，北京市中苏友好协会已结合当前的抗美援朝保家卫国的运动，积极展开了各种宣传活动。五日晚，该会在“中苏友声”时间，广播了艾思奇的文章《学习苏联的国际主义和爱国主义》。七日并将分别：（一）与友协总会在青年宫举行庆祝会，会上将有李济深、张澜、彭真及罗申大使等的讲话，并有中央音乐学院演出庆祝节目；（二）与北京市总工会在劳动人民文化宫举行全市工人庆祝大会；（三）与苏联对外文化协会在南河沿十九号举行演讲会，由苏联费利波夫讲《伟大十月社会主义革命三十三周年》。
    同时，京市中苏友协并将与总会联合于七日至九日出动五辆宣传车，在市内和郊区进行电影、播讲、唱片、图片等等宣传。
    该会并制出了苏联十月革命图片一套，共四十二张，从二日起开始在各区友协支会阅览室轮回展览。该会会刊《北京友协》也出版了《庆祝苏联十月革命节三十三周年，抗美援朝保家卫国》的专号，另外还出版了两本小册子（《论十月革命》与宣传学习手册《粉碎美帝扩大侵略战争的阴谋！》），通过这些方式，使会员们进一步认识苏联十月革命的意义与中国革命的关系，更加深对美帝的仇视、鄙视和蔑视。（陈应楠）
