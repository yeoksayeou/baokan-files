Xinhua News Agency, October 31st: Paris News: Despite the strong opposition of the people, the French government has manipulated the National Assembly to pass a bill on the 27th extending the term of military service from twelve months to eighteen months. Although the parliament, with the unanimous support of all right-wing parties, passed this bill that makes more French people cannon fodder for the United States, the movement of the French people against this bill is unfolding.

According to a TASS report: Since the Pleven government, at the behest of the United States, announced its decision to extend the term of military service on September 2nd, the French people have held mass rallies, demonstrations, and strikes, and have written letters to the National Assembly and sent many delegations to visit members of parliament and parliamentary groups of various parties to express their protests. "Days of Struggle Against Extending Military Service" were held throughout the country, and soldiers in Pomponne-Mousson protested the decision to extend military service by going on hunger strike. Paratroopers in Pont-de-Pont held a demonstration right at the entrance of the barracks. Soldiers in Saint-Maure marched with the people, their signs reading "Down with War." Huge slogans of "Down with 18 Months of Military Service" appeared on walls everywhere. When the bill to extend military service was discussed in parliament, Communist members and other progressive members fiercely criticized it. French Communist Party member Guyot read out a letter to parliament from the Secretary-General of the French General Confederation of Labor on behalf of the National Action Committee Against Extending Military Service, and announced that the French working people are determined to fight against arming West Germany, against extending military service, and against aggression in Vietnam.

    反对延长兵役法案
    【新华社三十一日讯】巴黎消息：法国政府不顾人民的强烈反对，已操纵国民议会在二十七日通过了把兵役期限从十二个月延长到十八个月的法案。虽然议会在各右翼政党一致支持下通过了这个使更多法国人为美国当炮灰的法案，但是法国人民反对这个法案的运动却正在展开。
    据塔斯社报道：自从九月二日普利文政府奉美国之命宣布决定延长兵役期限以来，法国人民即纷纷举行群众大会、游行示威与罢工，并致函国民议会和派遣许多代表团访问议员及各党派议会党团，表示抗议。全国各地都举行了“为反对延长兵役而斗争日”，蓬蓬谟松城的士兵们以绝食抗议延长兵役的决定。蓬托蓬的伞兵就在兵营门口举行了示威。圣麦佛尔的士兵与人民一起游行，他们的标语牌上写着“打倒战争”。全国到处墙壁上都出现了“打倒十八个月兵役”的巨大标语。当延长兵役的法案在议会讨论时，共产党议员与其他进步议员予以猛烈抨击。法共产党议员葛约宣读了法国总工会总书记代表反对延长兵役全国行动委员会致议会的信，并宣布法国劳动人民定将为反对武装西德，反对延长兵役，反对侵略越南而斗争。
