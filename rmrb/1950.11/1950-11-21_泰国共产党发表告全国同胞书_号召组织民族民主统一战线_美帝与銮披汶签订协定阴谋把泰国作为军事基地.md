　　Xinhua News Agency, 20th: The Communist Party of Thailand published "Letter to the Thai People" in the Thai-language newspaper "The Masses" on October 29th, calling for the organization of a national democratic united front to wage struggle against U.S. imperialism and the fascist running dog clique. The letter first pointed out: The reactionary Phibun government of Thailand has signed economic and military agreements with U.S. imperialism, creating an unprecedented national crisis, plunging Thailand into the status of a colony, and turning Thailand into a military base for U.S. imperialist aggression in Asia. The letter called on the people of the whole country to unite and organize a national democratic united front including all ethnic groups and every patriotic and democratic class, party, and organization to fight for national independence and democracy. The letter further pointed out: "Our struggle of the Thai people, in addition to fighting for national independence and democracy, must also unite with the people of the world to fight for lasting world peace and to stop wars of aggression."
　　
　　Xinhua News Agency, 20th: U.S. imperialism is building Thailand into an advance base for aggression against Vietnam and China. The fascist Phibun regime in Thailand, in order to beg dollars and military supplies from the United States, obediently acted as a lackey of Wall Street.

　　U.S. imperialism is tightly controlling Thailand's military, political, and economic affairs through the two agreements it concluded with the Phibun government. These two agreements are the "Thai-U.S. Economic and Technical Assistance Agreement" signed in Bangkok on September 19th and the "Thai-U.S. Military Assistance Agreement" signed on October 17th. Although the contents of these two agreements have not been made public, judging from the activities of the United States in Thailand before and after the signing of these two agreements, the conspiracy of the United States in Thailand is obvious. On August 26th, Meir Bal, a representative of the U.S. State Department, and Major General Erkins, commander of the First Division of the U.S. Marine Corps, led a military and economic mission to Bangkok to discuss the signing of economic and military agreements with the Thai government together with the U.S. Ambassador to Thailand, Stanton. During their visit to Thailand, the U.S. representatives surveyed airports, military ports, barracks, arsenals, coastal fortresses, and other military facilities in various parts of Thailand, and demanded that Thailand build strategic highways connecting the northern Thai-Vietnamese and Thai-Burmese borders and the southern part of Singapore. On August 29th, the U.S. military mission and the Thai delegation headed by Chief of Staff Luang Srisongkhram held a secret meeting at the Thai Ministry of Defense. During the meeting, the Thai side provided all strategic maps and military strength information for the U.S. side's reference, and agreed that the United States could monopolize Thailand's foreign trade by purchasing Thai materials with absolute freedom. In this way, the Thai government exchanged for the so-called "agricultural assistance" stipulated in the "Thai-U.S. Economic and Technical Assistance Agreement."

　　In order to obtain U.S. weapons, the Thai government paid a greater price in the "Military Assistance Agreement" negotiations. On September 29th, the Thai reactionary government sent Prince Mongkol to Tokyo to ask MacArthur for instructions. After the prince returned to China, the Thai reactionary government, disregarding the opposition of the vast number of Thai people, used methods of deceiving the people such as "imperial rewards" and "high monks sprinkling holy water" to drive Thai soldiers to serve as cannon fodder for U.S. imperialism in its invasion of Korea. The Thai reactionary government promised to send 4,000 troops, 1,200 of whom arrived in Korea on November 7th. The conditions put forward by the United States in the "Military Assistance" negotiations also included: when "war occurs," Thailand would supply rice and grain to the invading armies in Asia and the Far East and supply war materials to the United States without restriction. What the United States gave Thailand was: 10 million U.S. dollars worth of military supplies, equipment and training for nine battalions of Thai troops, and a total of 25.4 million U.S. dollars in loans to Thailand announced by the World Bank on October 30th.

　　On October 10th, the first batch of U.S. military advisory group arrived in Bangkok to train the Thai army. From then on, the United States will control the Thai army and military bases through the military advisory group.

　　泰国共产党发表告全国同胞书
    号召组织民族民主统一战线     
    美帝与銮披汶签订协定阴谋把泰国作为军事基地
    【新华社二十日讯】泰国共产党在十月二十九日出版的泰文《大众报》上发表《告全国同胞书》，号召组织民族民主统一战线，与美帝国主义及法西斯走狗集团展开斗争。告同胞书首先指出：泰国銮披汶反动政府已与美帝国主义签订了经济与军事上的协定，造成了空前的民族危机，使泰国陷于殖民地的地位，并把泰国变为美帝侵略亚洲的军事基地。告同胞书号召全国人民团结起来，组织一个包括各个民族及每一爱国的、民主的阶级、政党、社团的民族民主统一战线，为国家的独立与民主而斗争。告同胞书进而指出：“我们泰国人民的斗争，除了为国家的独立与民主而外，还必须与世界人民联合起来，为世界持久和平，为制止侵略战争而斗争。”
    【新华社二十日讯】美帝国主义正在把泰国建成侵略越南与中国的前进基地。泰国銮披汶法西斯政权为了向美国乞求美元与军火，恭顺地作了华尔街的仆从。
    美帝国主义正通过它与銮披汶政府缔结的两个协定，紧紧地控制泰国的军事、政治和经济。这两个协定是九月十九日在曼谷签订的《泰美经济技术援助协定》和十月十七日签订的《泰美军事援助协定》。这两个协定的内容虽未公布，但从这两个协定签订前后美国在泰国的活动看来，美国在泰国的阴谋，已昭然若揭。八月二十六日，美国国务院代表梅尔拜和美国海军陆战队第一师团司令厄琴斯少将，率领军事、经济使团到达曼谷，会同美国驻泰大使史丹顿，与泰国政府商谈签订经济、军事协定问题。美国代表们在访泰期间，勘查了泰国各地的机场、军港、兵营、兵工厂、海口堡垒和其他军事设备，要求泰国建筑北通泰越、泰缅边境，南通新加坡的战略公路。八月二十九日，美国军事使团和以参谋总长銮限翁堪颂为首的泰国代表团在泰国国防部开秘密会议。会中泰方提供了全部战略地图和军力情况给美方参考，并答应美国得以绝对自由购买泰国物资的方式，垄断泰国的对外贸易。这样，泰国政府才换得了《泰美经济技术援助协定》所规定的所谓《农业援助》。
    为了获致美国武器，泰国政府在《军事援助协定》谈判中，付出了更大的代价。九月二十九日，泰国反动政府派遣蒙昭披实亲王到东京向麦克阿瑟请示。在该亲王返国之后，泰国反动政府不顾泰国广大人民的反对，用“皇上赐赏钱”和“高僧洒法水”等愚民方法，驱使泰国士兵为美帝国主义充当侵朝的炮灰。泰国反动政府答应出兵四千名，其中一千二百名已于十一月七日到达了朝鲜。美国在“军援”谈判中提出的条件还包括：在“战争一旦发生”时，泰国供应米粮给亚洲与远东的侵略军队和毫无限制地供应战争原料给美国。而美国给泰国的是：价值一千万美元的军火，装备与训练泰军九个营，以及经由世界银行在十月三十日宣布给泰国总数二千五百四十万美元的贷款。
    十月十日，第一批美国军事顾问团已抵达曼谷，训练泰军。美国从此将经由军事顾问团，控制泰国的军队和军事基地。
