　　Actor's Performance Methods - Some Experiences in Rehearsal
　　Jin Shan

　　When I had a deeper understanding of the character of Pavel Korchagin, and then tried to learn from him, so that my personality was not too far from his, I worked hard on how to express him on the stage.

　　Pavel is a Russian, how do I play a Russian? Pavel is a Russian worker, how do I play a Russian worker? These two questions seem difficult to solve, but they are not too difficult to solve, because I didn't pay too much attention to these two questions at the beginning; besides doing some necessary learning, such as watching Soviet movies and pictures, and making friends with Soviet comrades to observe their expressions and movements, I mainly focused on understanding the enthusiastic and simple spirit of the Soviet people. I even thought: it doesn't matter if the appearance is not like a Soviet person, it would be terrible if the spirit is not like a Soviet person. But I must say, if the spirit is like a Soviet person, the appearance will inevitably be similar (this of course refers to more mature actors). As for the worker issue, it is even easier to solve. Gerasimov said it well: "The working people of the world, the conscious proletariat of the world, all have the common qualities of strength and simplicity." We cannot contact workers in Soviet factories and railways, but it is very easy for us to get close to workers in Chinese factories and railways. Furthermore, aren't those young Soviet experts who are helping us with construction work in New China all sons of the working people? So, performing a Soviet worker and performing a Soviet person is the same principle, there is no great mystery.

　　In the play, Pavel goes from a teenager to a nearly thirty-year-old adult. In the process of these ten years of struggle, I marked two lines for myself (Pavel). One line is that my physical strength is gradually declining, until I am blind and paralyzed. The other line is that my spirit is becoming more and more vigorous, from an instinctive sense of resistance to, after Party and League education, struggle, testing, and training, developing an unparalleled Bolshevik willpower that is indomitable and can overcome all reactionary fortresses. These two lines develop simultaneously. They are both contradictory and unified. The contradiction lies in the "physiology" refusing to obey the "will"; the unity lies in the spirit overcoming the body, and the "physiology" actually obeying the "will."

　　In the process of these two lines developing forward, I have to solve a series of problems, and these problems must be expressed through my self-image:

　　How do I play a teenager? A teenager is my past, not my present. I am forty years old this year, and I weigh 165 pounds. How can such a huge person play a child? It doesn't matter, I will work hard, I want to learn Pavel's spirit and overcome difficulties. So I started doing strenuous exercises. After a month and a half, I lost ten pounds. On the day of the performance, I lost another thirteen pounds, a total of twenty-three pounds. I currently weigh 142 pounds. Although I don’t look like a "skeleton," I don’t look like "four joys" either. But just losing weight cannot solve the fundamental problem. While losing weight, I often cared about the lives of children. I often lived in the spiritual realm of children. Usually when I walked, I jumped three steps and pushed off five steps. When entering and exiting the house, I sometimes jumped through the window, regardless of what others said. I tried to raise my pitch (playing a teenager), and I also practiced lowering my pitch (playing an adult). I used my abdomen (the so-called dantian) to control my voice. My Mandarin is not good, and I have difficulty distinguishing between sharp and round sounds, so I tried my best to learn and worship teachers everywhere. However, can these methods solve the fundamental problem? Still not. My fundamental problem is how to express the heart of this child who has been insulted and harmed since childhood, and who has developed a hatred and stubborn resistance spirit against the bourgeoisie since childhood. I can vaguely understand this spirit from my past life. When my memory goes back to my childhood, I immediately see the scene when I was forced to leave my feudal family and wandered the streets at night; I saw the situation when I had no way to go after leaving home, and angrily joined the army as a soldier; I also recalled the story of wanting to stab the priest with a small knife when I was wronged while studying at a Catholic school; I also thought of being caught by the "包打听" [baodating] and kicked and beaten in the police station when I marched and demonstrated against the White Russian reactionary newspaper office in Shanghai... These past experiences helped me understand the mood of the young Pavel; I also regarded it as an important reliance for creating the young Pavel.

　　The play was rehearsed scene by scene. When it came to the sixth scene, I (Pavel) suffered from severe typhoid fever and pneumonia. It was hateful that I had never suffered from these two diseases. I misunderstood it. In the early stage of rehearsal, I only felt cold all over, so I trembled non-stop on the stage. Others found it ridiculous, and I was very unhappy at the time. I also felt that my illness was serious, so I showed weakness in my limbs and looked like I was about to fall. Later, with the help of doctors and comrades who had suffered from typhoid fever, I understood that typhoid fever was not like that. At the same time, I listened to the suggestions of the director and actors, and emphasized the aspect of being strong and overcoming the pain, so that I (Pavel) in the sixth scene would not be easily defeated by the disease.

　　The play has been rehearsed to the seventh and eighth scenes. I am blind, then paralyzed, and suffer from cancer. I am anxiously waiting for a reply from the publishing house. I can understand some physical pain, because I have been seriously injured in a car accident, breaking bones and injuring tendons. I also understand that if my work is not accepted by the publishing house, I will prove that I cannot continue to work for the Party and lose the meaning of survival. But at the same time, because I comforted my mother and wife, I tried to restrain myself to avoid hurting my loved ones. When I received the telegram, proving that I could still work for the Party, I forgot all the pain, that is, I overcame all the pain and obtained the highest happiness in life. This is the climax of the play, and the essence of Pavel's spirit. I agreed with the rehearsal procedure decided by the director: first rehearse my pain, then rehearse my overcoming pain, and finally rehearse my happiness. In the first stage of rehearsal, I tried my best to experience physical and mental pain. Every time I rehearsed, my ears rang, my eyes were dizzy, and I was sweating profusely, feeling like my internal organs were about to split. In the second stage, I rehearsed overcoming pain. This "overcoming" work was not easy to do, but because I deeply experienced the pain, I knew what kind of strength to use to overcome the pain. When the play was rehearsed to the third stage, I then experienced the joy of victory.

　　In this eighth scene, I always sat in a reclining chair. Except that my head and neck and right wrist could be stretched slightly, other muscles could not move at all. I had to use internal heat to express my emotions through a latent tone and expression. This scene was very hard for me to rehearse. I am not satisfied with what I am showing on the stage now, but there is one point that should be affirmed, that is, this kind of rehearsal method is very commendable.

　　Throughout the rehearsal process, I have been living in a subtle realm. My usual life changes my emotions with Pavel's different situations in each scene; for example, when Pavel was a teenager, my off-stage life (that is, my usual life) became lively and even childish. When Pavel was in pain, my off-stage life also became slow and anxious. This realm can only be reached by actors.

　　Throughout the rehearsal and performance process, I consciously paid attention to three points. Now I have proved that these three points are helpful to the creation of the role and the progress of the entire rehearsal work. What are these three points? First, although I am also a director, when I am working as an actor in a play, I must forget that I was a director. I listen to the director's requests and opinions with the heart of a child. I try to figure out the director's intentions, and strive to complete the task of unifying the director's intentions and my personal (actor's) intentions. Second, before, after and during rehearsals, I never design external movements in advance. I put all my energy into delving into the character's inner world. The movements will gradually and unconsciously emerge during the rehearsal process. Such movements will then be determined by the unified opinion of the director and the actors; such external movements will be consistent with the inner emotions. Third, the stage before the play is performed (that is, during rehearsal) is an important creative stage, but the performance is an even more important creative stage; in front of different audiences every day, we feel different reactions, which cause us (actors) many different stimuli, and therefore have different degrees of expression concentration. I oppose an actor's many subtle emotions on stage remaining unchanged. I require that I have fresh feelings about the fresh things I encounter every day, otherwise there is no way to have new creations and new achievements.

　　演员的表现方法  我在排演中的一点经验
　　金山
    当我对保尔·柯察金这人物，有了较深的理解，进而努力向他学习，使自己的人格不和他距离太远的时候，我又努力于如何能在舞台上将他表现出来。
    保尔是个俄国人，我怎样演俄国人？保尔是个俄国工人，我又怎样去演俄国工人？这两个问题，看来似很难解决，其实并不太难解决，因为我一开头就不太重视这两个问题；我除了做些必要的学习，例如看苏联电影、画片，和苏联同志交友，借以观察其神态动作之外，主要地我在体会苏联人的热情朴实的精神，我甚至这样想：外形不像苏联人又何妨，精神不像苏联人才糟糕。但话得说回来，如果精神像了苏联人，外形必将随之而近似（这自是指较为成熟的演员而言）。至于工人问题，更易解决，格拉西莫夫讲得好：“全世界的劳动人民，全世界的觉悟了的无产阶级，都具有共同的坚强朴素的品质。”我们不可能接触苏联工厂与铁路上的工人，我们却很易接近中国工厂与铁路上的工人。再进一步说，来到新中斩那些帮助我们从事建设工作的苏联青年专家们，还不都是劳动人民的儿子吗？所以说，表演苏联工人和表演苏联人是同一道理，没有太大奥妙。
    剧中保尔从十几岁少年直到近三十岁的成年，在这十几年的斗争生活过程中，我替我（保尔）记上两条线，一条线是我体力日趋衰退，直至双目失明，全身瘫痪。另一条线是我精神日趋旺盛，从一种本能的反抗意识，直至经过党团教育，斗争考验和锻炼，养成了一种世无匹敌的，顽强不屈、百折不挠的，可以攻克一切反动堡垒的布尔什维克的毅力。这两条线同时发展着，它们既矛盾又统一，矛盾在于“生理”不肯顺从“心意”；统一在于精神战胜了肉体，“生理”竟又顺从了“心意”。
    这两条线在向前发展着的过程中，我要解决一连串的问题，这些问题都要通过自我形象表达出来：
    我怎样表演少年呢？十几岁的孩子，是我的过去，不是我的现在，我今年四十岁了，我体重一百六十五磅，庞然大物，怎能演孩子呢？不要紧，我努力，我要学习保尔的精神，克服困难。于是我开始作激烈运动，一个半月后，减了十磅，上演那天，又减十三磅，先后共减二十三磅，现存一百四十二磅，看来虽不像“排骨”，却也不像“四喜”。但光减体重，不能解决基本问题，我在进行减体重的同时，常常关心着儿童们的生活，我常生活在儿童的精神领域之中，平时行起路来，三步一跳，五步一蹬，出入房屋，有时越窗而过，不管他人笑话。我努力使音调提高（扮演少年），我又练习音调降低（扮演成年），我运用腹部（所谓丹田）控制声音。我的国语不灵，尖团难分，我就勉力学习，到处拜老师。然而这些做法，就能解决基本问题了吗？还是不能。我的基本问题，是如何表现这从小就被侮辱与被损害的赤子之心，他从小就被养成了对资产阶级仇恨和倔强的反抗精神。这种精神，我略能从我过去的生活中体会一二。当我的记忆回溯到我的少年时代，我立刻就看到当时我被迫离开了封建之家，黑夜流浪在街头的情景；我看到了我离家之后，走头无路，愤而投军当兵的情况；我又回想起我在天主教学校读书时，因受委屈，拿着小刀子想刺神父的故事；我又想到在上海游行示威打白俄反动报馆，被“包打听”抓进巡捕房拳打脚踢的故事……这些过去的生活，帮助我体会了少年保尔的心情；我也就把它当作创造少年保尔的重要依靠。
    戏是一景景地排下去了，排到第六景时，我（保尔）害上严重的伤寒与肺炎，可恨我并未害过这两种病，我体会错了，在排练的初期，我只感到混身发冷，故在台上战栗不止，别人见了觉得可笑，我当时很不高兴。我又感到我的病重，所以表现四肢无力，摇摇欲坠之状。后经医生和害过伤寒病的同志的帮助，使我才懂得伤寒病不是那样，同时又听从导演及演员同志们的建议，强调了坚强克服病痛的一面，庶使第六景的我（保尔）不被病魔所轻易击倒。
    戏排到第七八景了，我双目失明，接着全身瘫痪，且患癌症。我痛苦焦急地等待着出版局的回信。我能体会生理上一些痛苦，因我曾因翻车重伤，折骨伤筋。我又理解到如我的作品不被出版局接受，我就证明自己不能继续为党工作，失去生存的意义。但我同时又因安慰我的妈妈和妻子，我就努力克制自己，免使亲爱的人伤心。等到收了电报，证明自己还能为党工作时，我就忘掉一切痛苦，也就是战胜了一切痛苦，获得了人生最高的幸福。这是全剧的高潮，保尔的基本精神之所在。我同意了导演所决定的排演程序：首先排练我的痛苦，然后排练我克服痛苦，最后排练我的快活。在排练的第一阶段，我极力体会生理上与精神上的痛苦，每排一次，耳鸣目眩，汗流浃背，颇有五脏俱裂之感。第二阶段，排练我克服痛苦，这“克服”工作，很不易做，但因我深切地体验了痛苦，我就懂得用怎样的力量来克服痛苦。戏排到第三阶段时，我就随之而体会到胜利的快活。
    这第八景的戏，我始终坐在躺椅上，除了头颈与右腕略能伸展外，其他肌体，毫不能动，我必需用内在的热力，通过一种潜伏性的音调与表情，表达出我的感情来。这场戏排得我好苦。现在我所表现在舞台上的，我并不满意，但有一点，似应被肯定的，就是这样一种排练方法，是很可取的。
    在全排演过程中，我一直生活在一种微妙的境界中，我平时的生活，随着保尔在各场上境遇的不同而转移我的情绪；比如保尔在少年时，我的戏外生活（也就是平时生活）也就活泼以至于幼稚起来。保尔在病痛时，我的戏外生活，也迟缓和焦急起来。这种领域，只有演员才能达到。
    在全剧排演与演出过程中，我曾有意识地注意三点，现在我自己证明这三点都有助于角色创造和全剧排练工作的进展的。这三点是什么呢？第一点，我虽也是个导演，但我在一个剧中担任演员工作时，我必须忘记自己曾是导演，我以赤子一般的心情，听取导演对我的要求和意见，我努力揣摸导演的意图，以及努力完成导演意图和我个人（演员）意图的统一任务。第二点，排演前后与当时，我从不事先设计外形动作，我全力钻入角色的内心。动作将在排演过程中逐渐地下意识地产生出来，这种动作，再经过导演与演员的统一意见而共定取舍；这样的外形动作，庶与内心的情感取得一致。第三点，戏剧上演前（即排练时），是重要的创作阶段，但在公演时，更是重要的创作阶段；我们在每天不同的观众面前，感受到不同的反应，引起了我们（演员）多少不同的刺激，因而也就有了不等份量的表现浓度。我反对一个演员在台上的许多细微感情一成不变，我要求我对每天所接触到的新鲜事物，有新鲜的感觉，要不然是无法有新的创造和新的成就的。
