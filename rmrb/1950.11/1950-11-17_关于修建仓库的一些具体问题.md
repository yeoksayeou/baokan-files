　　Some Specific Issues Regarding Warehouse Construction
　　Liang Zhu-hang Gu Jiu-yan
　　Building warehouses is one of the urgent tasks in the current grain management work. The Second National Public Grain Management Conference, according to the State Council's "Decision on Unifying National Public Grain Revenue, Expenditure, Storage, and Dispatch," required "planned construction of grain warehouses within three to five years." It specifically drafted a preliminary plan for national warehouse construction over three years, aiming to gradually resolve the national storage capacity within three years and improve warehouse conditions within five years. Under the new circumstances, this plan will inevitably have new considerations. Here are a few suggestions on some specific issues related to warehouse construction.

　　(I) Classification of Grain Warehouses

　　(A) Based on the construction method, they can be divided into:

　　One: Formal warehouses: with reasonable construction, permanent, suitable for major cities with convenient transportation, for reserves, transit, and supply.

　　Two: Simple warehouses: construction conditions are slightly flexible, with the aim of saving construction costs and expanding storage capacity. Their construction sites should be in larger towns with relatively convenient transportation, for transit, supply, and storage. During construction, in addition to using local materials and adapting to local conditions, space should be reserved to allow for continued renovation in stages, based on economic conditions, to complete them as formal warehouses.

　　Three: Folk-style warehouses: referring to the popular old warehouses in the local area, such as cave dwellings, reed stacks, and cylindrical sealed warehouses, improved using scientific methods. Suitable for areas with insufficient engineering conditions and technical standards.

　　Four: Expanded and repaired warehouses: using existing public buildings, temples, ancestral halls, and landlord's houses, repaired to suit grain storage conditions. These warehouses are mainly for storage. In rural areas, they can be distributed according to actual needs, while in towns, because they also serve a supply function, they should be more concentrated.

　　(B) Based on the purpose of use, they can be divided into:

　　One: Storage and transportation warehouses: used for long-term grain reserves. They should be strategically located in safe areas with convenient transportation and areas prone to floods and droughts. However, in mountainous areas with inconvenient transportation, consideration can be given to reserving some grain warehouses for reserves. Under current conditions, the construction method should be bulk storage, sealed, and using folk-style forms as much as possible.

　　Two: Transfer warehouses: specially for scheduling, transshipment, centralization, receiving, and dispatching. Their capacity should be large, and packaging is preferred. Construction sites should be chosen in places with convenient water and land transportation, requiring a dispersed or linear layout, but must form a network of connections.

　　Three: Supply warehouses: have both short-term reserve nature and must be transported at any time. Their construction sites are mainly in large cities and secondary towns.

　　Four: Storage warehouses: only for temporary storage when collecting and warehousing. They are suitable for ordinary towns and rural areas, should be evenly distributed, and spread out in a dispersed "surface" pattern.

　　(C) Based on the method of grain storage, they can be divided into:

　　One: Bulk storage warehouses: grain is placed in the warehouse without packaging. Therefore, the walls need to be strong, and should be strengthened with piers, tie rods, hoops, and protective boards to prevent collapse. Although the current bulk storage warehouses are expensive due to the fact that the main building materials are foreign, making the construction cost higher than packaged warehouses, it is still cost-effective to build bulk storage warehouses in terms of practicality.

　　Two: Packaged warehouses: grain is packaged in bags and can be stacked away from the walls in the warehouse, so the walls are not subject to a large lateral pressure, and the structure is relatively simple. However, because the consumption of packaging is too high, it is mainly suitable for warehouses used for transportation.

　　Three: Dual-purpose (bulk and packaged) warehouses: practically the same as bulk storage warehouses, but the load-bearing capacity of the floor must be specially strengthened. Because packaged warehouses can be stacked very high, the pressure on the floor is greater.

　　(D) Based on the relationship between the warehouse and the climate, they can be divided into:

　　One: Sealed warehouses: isolated from the outside air, suitable for long-term storage of grain. As long as the warehouse has moisture-proof and heat-proof performance, and the grain can be kept clean and stored after drying, damage from insects, rodents, birds, mold, and spoilage can be reduced. If the structure is appropriate, it can also avoid losses from water, fire, theft, etc., and reduce a lot of management work.

　　Two: Ventilated warehouses: suitable for particularly humid areas south of the Yangtze River, and warehouses that are not used for reserves. The warehouse floor should be higher off the ground, and wind power should be used as much as possible to keep the grain dry, but attention should be paid to the prevention of insects, birds, rodents, theft, etc.

　　Three: Dual-purpose control warehouses: can be sealed in humid weather and when fumigation is needed to kill insects, and can be ventilated regularly. This type of warehouse is the most desirable, but the equipment is more complicated and the construction cost is also higher.

　　(II) Site Selection for Warehouse Construction

　　The construction of grain warehouses must first select an appropriate site. In addition to determining the towns for warehouse construction based on subjective needs and transportation conditions, the selection method must also determine the specific location and form based on objective conditions such as development prospects, terrain, geology, and transportation. (1) In terms of transportation, water transportation relies on rivers, but rivers may have dry seasons, so the low water level must be considered to avoid the difficulty of ships not being able to dock; at the same time, it is necessary to prevent flooding, and even in low-lying areas not along the river, attention should be paid to the flood level to prevent submersion. This year, many warehouses along the Huai River were flooded, which can be taken as a lesson. Land transportation relies on highways and railways. Although railway transportation is the most economical and convenient, if it is not close to the station or there is no transfer track for parking and loading and unloading, it is still useless even if it is next to the railway line. (2) The size of the warehouse is determined by the amount of grain to be stored, but because there must be room for drying yards and handling, and it must be isolated from nearby houses, the total land area is often several times larger than the warehouse itself. If it is necessary to expand the storage capacity in the future, add processing, equipment sorting and equipment manufacturing factories, or increase fumigation equipment and other necessary houses, then advance planning should be made to leave space. (3) The construction of grain warehouses in a region should first arrange points and lines according to the direction of regular grain flow, so that they form a network of connections. Even if only a part of the warehouses is built first, it must be adapted to the network of the entire plan, and efforts should be made to avoid disorder. (4) The base should be high and dry to facilitate flood prevention, moisture prevention, and the setting of sewers. The soil should be firm and even to prevent the warehouse from being dangerous due to unstable foundations. Other aspects such as orientation, wind direction, and surrounding environment should be considered everywhere to achieve the effect of "ten preventions."

　　Although the location of the warehouse is subject to the type of warehouse needed, different locations can still use different design techniques to adapt to special circumstances. For example, if the ground is narrow, multi-story warehouses can be built; if the terrain is low-lying, it can be filled and raised or converted into trestle-type warehouses; if the soil is loose, piles can be driven and the foundation can be strengthened; if there are houses around, fire-resistant buildings can be renovated; if there is a lack of drying yards, flat roofs can be used; even if transportation is inconvenient, ways can be found to improve it. However, the importance should be weighed, the gains and losses should be weighed, and discussions should be held with all relevant parties and technicians to plan and decide.

　　(III) Matters Needing Attention in Warehouse Construction

　　According to the current financial situation, warehouse construction should still focus on building fewer formal warehouses, building more simple warehouses and folk-style warehouses, and expanding and repairing warehouses as much as possible to meet storage capacity needs, and then gradually increasing formal warehouses and improving simple warehouses to replace private houses and open-air storage yards.

　　In the structure of the warehouse, attention must be paid to waterproofing, fire prevention, heat prevention, moisture prevention, insect prevention, rodent prevention, bird prevention, theft prevention, air defense, and collapse prevention. (1) Waterproofing: The warehouse must not be flooded, so the flood level should be known in advance, and then the floor height should be determined. (2) Fire prevention: The warehouse wood should not be exposed, wooden doors and windows can be wrapped and nailed with galvanized iron sheets, the eaves can be sealed with bricks, and attention should be paid to isolating it from nearby houses. If a grain warehouse itself is very long, it should be separated by firewalls. (3) Heat prevention: The heat of sunlight must not be transmitted from the surrounding area and above the warehouse. Special attention should be paid to the west-facing part and the roof. Therefore, rectangular grain warehouses should not be arranged in a north-south row, but should be arranged in an east-west row. The front of the warehouse should be slightly biased to the southeast. The wall should be thick, or a hollow wall should be built. The roof should be equipped with ventilation windows, and a ceiling should be made under it. Ventilation holes should be left under the eaves and on the walls above the ceiling to facilitate air convection and prevent radiant heat from passing through the ceiling. (4) Moisture prevention: Asphalt and oil felt and other moisture-proof materials should be used on the footings, inside the walls, and on the cement floor to isolate the rising moisture in the soil. Hollow walls can have a lateral moisture-proof effect. The roof should be leak-proof, and the inside of the warehouse and under the floor must be ventilated. Ventilation slots and bamboo air cylinders should be installed in the warehouse, and air inlets should be installed along the floor. (5) Insect prevention: The warehouse must be able to be sealed at any time for fumigation. Effective heat avoidance and moisture avoidance can keep the warehouse cool and dry, which is also a way to prevent insects. However, how to effectively prevent small insects such as ants from climbing into the warehouse needs further research. (6) Rodent prevention: The roads that allow rodents to enter must be blocked. Ventilation holes should be covered with fine-mesh iron plates, rodent-proof boards should be used to block the entrance, and the structure and materials used everywhere must make it impossible for rodents to dig holes. (7) Bird prevention: The doors and windows that transmit light and ventilate should be covered with wire mesh. (8) Theft prevention: There should be strict defenses to facilitate guarding. (9) Air defense: Do not make the target obvious. Red and white bricks and tiles are the most unsuitable. The arrangement of the warehouse should also be properly dispersed, but at the same time, the convenience of management must be taken into account. The appearance should be consistent with the surrounding environment at that time in order to hide the target. (10) Collapse prevention: The floor of ordinary warehouses and the walls of bulk storage warehouses are different from ordinary houses and should have special resistance strength. If this is not paid attention to, it will often cause collapse after loading grain.

　　(IV) Construction Method of Grain Warehouses

　　Once the warehouse site has been surveyed and determined and the structural design has been properly completed, the last step is to start construction. The construction methods that can be adopted are self-management, entrusted agency, or bidding and contracting. Entrusted agency can be divided into two types: ordinary agency and responsibility agency. Ordinary agency is based on actual settlement, regardless of the construction cost, and a percentage of the total construction cost is given as an agency fee; responsibility agency is also based on actual settlement, but the cost range is limited in advance. If there is an excess, the agent bears the loss; if there is a surplus, except for the agency fee, all belong to the owner, but a certain reward can be added according to the amount of the surplus as a reward. The advantages and disadvantages of various construction methods are explained separately below so that they can be adopted based on the actual conditions.

　　(1) Direct self-management - can save expenses, and the materials can be realistic. However, there must be appropriate technical and administrative personnel, many people, and good quality; otherwise, it cannot be done, or at least not well. In the case of insufficient technical personnel, this method should only be used for demonstration experiments.

　　(2) Responsibility agency system - entrusting others to operate is relatively easy, and the contractor can also handle the design work and bear the responsibility of warranty, which is one of its advantages; second, all funds can be reimbursed within a certain limit, and the contractor only extracts the agency fee according to the final total cost, so the materials can be more realistic. If the purchase is appropriate, and the labor and expenses are moderate, the total construction cost may be lower than that of the general contracting (but still more expensive than self-management with conditions). Third, since the funds are limited, there is no trouble of exceeding the budget. However, precisely because of this, when prices rise, the contractor often cuts corners to avoid losses, and because all tools and equipment must be purchased and reimbursed at market prices, the construction cost may be more expensive than general contracting. This method is suitable when one's own strength is insufficient, it is necessary to entrust others to design, there are difficulties in bidding, and prices fluctuate. It is not necessary to study its valuation list in detail before signing the contract, but later it should pay attention to reviewing the purpose of its expenditure, and carefully supervise the work as with general contracting. If it is not necessary to handle the design at the same time, it is best to take the form of bidding and contracting, and make appointments with several companies to estimate the price for comparison in order to choose. If half of the project in the same location can be managed by itself and half entrusted to a responsibility agency for comparison, there will be a mutual learning effect.

　　(3) Ordinary agency system - in general, similar to the responsibility agency system, but there is no limit to the cost. The good aspect is that materials can be realistic, and the bad aspect is that there may be waste and other problems, and the construction cost is often the most expensive, and it is impossible to control the budget. This method is suitable for periods of price fluctuations, and the contractor can be asked to handle the design at the same time. When using this method, the most important thing is to audit the accounts.

　　(4) Bidding and contracting - there must first be drawings and construction instructions, and an accurate budget, and then qualified construction companies should be notified to bid, and the entire project should be contracted out. As long as there are reliable technicians who carefully supervise the work, everything else can be ignored, so the method is the simplest. The construction company has its own plans and methods (referring to the legitimate side), and sometimes the cost may be the cheapest, but it is also the most likely to cut corners, and even have problems that cannot be completed. Therefore, when selecting bidders, their recent experience, ability, capital, and credit should be thoroughly investigated for reference. The decision to award the bid should not only pay attention to the total price, but also carefully review its unit prices and calculate whether there are any errors, so as to make it reasonable, so as to reduce various concerns.

　　关于修建仓库的一些具体问题
    梁竹航  顾久衍
    修建仓库，是当前粮食管理工作中的迫切任务之一。二届全国公粮管理会议，根据政务院“关于统一国家公粮收支保管调度的决定”中要求“有计划地在三五年内建设粮食仓库”的指示，具体草拟了全国三年建仓计划初步方案，要求在三年内逐步达到解决全国仓容，五年内改善仓库条件的目的。这个计划，在新的形势下，必然会有新的考虑。兹就有关建库的一些具体问题，提供几点意见。
    （一）粮食仓库的分类
    （甲）根据修建的方式，可分为：
    一、正式库：构造合理，有永久性，适合于交通方便的重要城市，作储备、转运及供应等用。
    二、简易库：构造条件，稍可迁就，以节省建筑费用与扩大仓容为目的。其设建地点，以交通较便的较大城镇为宜，作转运、供应及收纳等用。建造时，除应就地取材、因地制宜外，并须预留地步，使能根据经济条件，继续添修，分期完成为正式库。
    三、民俗式库：参照当地流行的旧仓，如窑洞、苇囤及圆筒形密闭仓等的构造形式，依科学方法加以改良。适用于工程条件及技术水准不足的地区。
    四、扩修库：利用原有的公房、庙宇、祠堂及地主房屋等，加以修理，使适合储粮条件。这种仓库主要是作收纳用，在乡村可根据事实需要，分散布置，在城镇则因兼有供应作用，应比较集中。
    （乙）根据使用的目的，可分为：
    一、储运库：作长期储备粮食之用，宜选择交通方便的安全区域及容易发生水旱灾荒地带，有重点的布置，但在运输不便的山区，亦可考虑将一部分粮仓留作储备之用。按照目前的条件，其造法以散装、密闭并尽量采用民俗型式为宜。
    二、调运库：专供调度、转运、集中、收发之用，其容量宜大，以包装式为佳。建造地点，应择水陆交通方便的地方，要求疏散式或一线式的布置，但须构成网状的联络。
    三、供应库：既有短期储备性质，又须随时调运，其修建地点主要是在大城市和次要城镇。
    四、收纳库：仅供征收入仓时临时收纳之用，适用于普通的城镇及乡区，宜平均分散，成疏散式“面”的展布。
    （丙）根据储粮的方法，可分为：
    一、散装库：粮食在仓内不用装具，散置库内，故墙壁需要坚固，应以墩子、拉条、腰箍及护仓板等牵撑结实，以防压坍。虽然目前散装库因建筑材料主要是外货，价钱很贵，致造价比包装库为大，但就实用论，修建散装库仍是合算的。
    二、包装库：粮食用口袋包装，可在库内离墙堆放，故墙壁不致受到很大的侧压力，构造比较简单。但因装具的消耗太大，所以主要只适于调运用的仓库。
    三、包、散两用库：实际与散装库相同，但须特别加强地板的载重能力。因为包装库可堆放很高，地板所受的压力较大。
    （丁）根据仓库与气候的关系，可分为：
    一、密闭库：与外界空气隔绝，适合于长期储藏粮食，只要仓库具有防潮、防热的性能，而粮食又能保持清洁，并在晒干后进仓，则对于虫、鼠、鸟雀、霉烂、变质等损害，都可减少。倘构造合宜，并可避免水火盗窃等损失，减省很多管理工作。
    二、通风库：适合于长江以南气候特别潮湿的地区，而且是不作储备用途的仓库。库底离地宜较高，尽量利用风力以保持粮食的干燥，但应注意防卫虫、鸟、鼠、盗等的设备。
    三、两用控制库：遇到潮湿天气及需要薰蒸杀虫时，可以密闭，经常则可以通风。此类仓库最合要求，但设备较复杂，建筑费亦较大。
    （二）建仓地点的选择
    粮仓的修建，首须选择适当的地点。选择方法，除了根据主观需要及交通条件确定建仓的城镇外，还要就发展前途、地形、地质、交通等客观情况，确定具体场所与形式。（１）交通方面，水运依靠河道，但河道可能有干涸的季节，因之必须考虑枯水位，以免发生船只不能靠岸的困难；同时要防避泛滥，即使在不沿河的低地，也应注意洪水位，以防淹没。今年淮河沿岸仓库，多被水淹，可引为教训。陆运依靠公路、铁路，铁路运输虽最经济便捷，但若不靠近车站或无转运轨道可停车装卸，则虽旁近铁路线，仍属无用。（２）仓库的大小，虽按应储粮食的数量而定，但因还要有晒场与搬运回旋的余地，并须与邻近房屋隔离，故用地总面积，常较仓库本身超过数倍。如果将来还要扩充仓容、增设加工、器材整理与器材制造等工厂，或增加熏蒸设备与其他必要房屋，则更应预作打算，留出地位。（３）一地区粮仓的建造，应先按粮食经常流转的方向，布置点线，使构成网状的连系，即使先只修建一部分的仓库，亦须使之适应整个计划的网络，力避杂乱无章。（４）基地宜高爽，以便于防水、防潮及设置下水道。土壤宜坚实平匀，以免仓库因基础不稳发生危险，其他如方向、风向以及周围环境，都宜处处顾到，以收“十防”的功效。
    建仓地点，虽受所需要的仓库种类的支配，但不同的地点，仍可利用不同的设计技巧以适应特殊情况。譬如地面狭窄可造楼房仓库，地势低洼可填土加高或改建台架式仓库，土壤松软，可以打桩并加强底脚，周围有民房可改造防火建筑，缺乏晒场可利用平顶屋面，甚至交通不便亦可设法改善。但应权其轻重，衡其得失，商同各有关方面及技术人员计划决定之。
    （三）建仓应注意的事项
    按照目前的财政情况，粮库建造仍以少建正式库、多建简易库及民俗式库为宜，并应尽可能修建扩修库，以满足仓容需要，然后再逐步增加正式库，改良简易库，以代替民房与露天的仓屯。
    在仓库的构造上必须注意防水、防火、防热、防湿、防虫、防鼠、防雀、防盗、防空及防坍。（１）防水：须使仓库不被水淹，故应预知洪水位，然后确定地板高度。（２）防火：须使仓库木料不外露，木造门窗，可用白铁皮包钉，檐口可用砖头封住，同时注意与邻近房屋隔离，若一栋粮仓本身很长，宜用防火墙分隔。（３）防热：须使太阳光的热度不致由仓库四周及上面传入，应特别注意西晒部分及屋顶，故长方形粮仓，不应采取南北纵列式，而应采取东西纵列式，仓前面以略微偏向东南为宜。墙宜厚，或筑空心墙，屋顶应设置通气窗，其下应做天花板，天花板以上之檐下、墙上应留通气洞，以便空气对流，防止辐射热透过天花板。（４）防潮：须于勒脚、墙内及水泥地下，用沥青及油毛毡等防潮材料，隔绝泥土内上升的湿气。空心墙可发生侧面的防潮作用。屋顶应防漏雨，仓库内及地板下须能通风，库仓内应设置通风槽及篾篓气筒，沿地板下安装进气洞。（５）防虫：须使仓库能随时密闭，以便熏蒸。有效的避热、避潮，能保持仓库的阴凉干燥，亦为防虫的办法，惟如何有效地防止蚁类等小虫爬进仓内，尚待进一步研究。（６）防鼠：须杜绝可启鼠类窜入的道路，通气孔洞应用细眼铁板封盖，门口用防鼠板拦阻，各处构造及所用材料，须使鼠类无法打洞。（７）防雀：须将透光及通风的门窗孔洞，用铁丝网遮隔。（８）防盗：应有严密的关防，便于看守。（９）防空：勿使目标显露，红白砖瓦最不相宜，仓库的排列，亦应作适当的疏散，但同时须照顾管理上的方便，外观的形状能与当时的环境相一致，以便隐避目标。（１０）防坍：一般仓库的地板及散装库的墙壁，与普通房屋不同，应有特殊的抵抗强度，若不注意及此，装粮后常致坍毁。
    （四）粮食库的营造办法
    建仓地点既经勘定，构造设计亦已妥当，最后便是开工营造。营造办法，可采用自办、委托代办或招标发包。委托代办又可分为普通代办及责任代办两种方式，普通代办是不论造价多少，核实结算，依总造价给予百分之几的代办费；责任代办制虽亦核实结算，但预先限定造价范围，如有超出，由代办者自承损失，若有结余，除代办费外，均归业主，惟可按结余数额，加给若干酬劳，作为奖励。现将各种营造办法的优缺点分别说明，以便能根据现实条件，决定采用。
    （１）直接自办——可以节省开支，工料亦可求实在。惟须有适当的技术及事务人员，人手要多，素质要好，否则就无法办，至少是办不好。在技术人员不足的情况下只有作示范性的实验时，才应采用这种办法。
    （２）责任代办制——托人经营，比较省事，且可由承办者兼办设计工作，连带负起保固的责任，此其优点之一；第二、一切用款，在某一限度内可实报实销，承办者只按最后总造价提成抽取代办费，故工料可较实在，倘购置得宜，人工及开支适度，则全部建筑费可能比大包低廉（但比有条件的自办还是较贵的）。第三、经费既有限度，可无超出预算的麻烦。但正因如此，在物价上涨时，承办者为避免赔累，往往偷工减料，且因一切工具设备等都要按照市价现购报销，故建筑费亦可能比较大包为昂。本办法适用于自己力量不够，需要托人设计、招标另有困难、及物价有波动现象的时候。在订约以前不必详细研究其估价单，但以后便应注意审核其开支用途，并应和对待大包一样，慎重监工。若不需兼办设计，则最好能采取招标发包的方式，多约几家估价比较，以便选择。倘能将同一地点的工程分一半自办，一半委托责任代办，彼此研究比较，则更有相互学习的作用。
    （３）普通代办制——一般情形，与责任代办制相仿，惟造价并无限制。好的方面，是工料可求实在，坏的方面，则可能有浪费及其他毛病发生，建筑费往往最贵，更无法掌握预算，本办法适用于物价波动时期，并可请包办者兼办设计。采用本办法时，最主要的是审核帐目。
    （４）招标发包——要先有图样及施工说明书，并作精确预算，然后通知认为合格的营造商投标，将工程全部包出。只要有可靠的技术人员认真监工，其他一切可以不管，所以办法最简便。营造厂另有他的打算及办法（指正当的一面）有时造价可能最廉，但是也最容易发生偷工减料、甚至出毛病不能完工的弊病。所以选择投标人的时候，应确实调查其最近经历、能力、资力及信用，以资舍取。决定得标人亦不能只注意总价高低，要详细审核其单价及计算有无差误，求其合理，这样就可减少种种顾虑了。
