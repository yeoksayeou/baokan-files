　　Defend World Peace! Oppose American Aggression!
    Editor

    Ignoring the repeated protests of our Foreign Minister Zhou, the American imperialists continue to expand the flames of war in the East, stabbing at China like two knives with Taiwan and the Sino-Korean border. At the same time, they crudely violate the principles of the United Nations and the UN Charter, attempting to drag UN member states down the path of military adventurism and ignite a new world war. In this grave situation, the Chinese people's deep hatred for the American imperialist aggressors is inseparable from their love for world peace. Taking practical action to oppose American aggression has become the fundamental content of China's movement to defend world peace.

    Combat hero Ma Chunyu wrote in a letter to this newspaper: "We are the People's Liberation Army who resolutely defend world peace, we are the strength of the people of the world. We resolutely oppose the American imperialists' aggressive acts in Korea! If the American imperialists dare to burn the flames of war onto our soil, we will surely destroy them in the flames!" Railway model worker Tian Yunhua expressed his written opinion: "American imperialism bites people like a mad dog. It is stepping up its war of aggression, attempting to follow the old path of Japanese寇aggression against Asia and China, to enslave the Chinese people. But the Chinese people have long seen through the ambitions of American imperialism and have long known their conspiracies and tricks. We have the correct leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, an invincible People's Liberation Army, and a strong and united people. We will surely use an iron hammer to smash the heads of the American imperialist aggressors." Such voices are enough to represent the calls of hundreds of millions of Chinese people who love their motherland today.

    The "China Committee for the Defense of World Peace" and the "China People's Committee Against U.S. Aggression in Taiwan and Korea" merged and reorganized into the "China People's Committee for the Defense of World Peace and Against U.S. Aggression" on October 26. Obviously, this is in line with the current feelings and demands of the people across the country.

    The Chinese people have been tempered by long-term wars and have a firm confidence and determination to eliminate any aggressor. In recent months, with the increasing expansion of the flames of the American war of aggression against Korea, the Chinese people have increasingly used peaceful signatures to express their great will to oppose American aggression and their fervent feelings to defend world peace. The number of signatures on the Stockholm Appeal exceeded the target of 200 million people set by China and the Soviet Union on October 26.

    As of October 26, the total number of peace signatures nationwide was 204,489,172. As far as we know, the number of peace signatures worldwide reached 500 million in early October. Due to the continued increase in the number of peace signatures in China and other countries in the last two weeks, it is now estimated to be close to 600 million.

    This great peace force, unprecedented in world history, further unites, organizes, and carries out an unyielding struggle, is bound to destroy the American aggressors in the flames they have ignited. The direction of the Second World Peace Congress to be held in London next month lies in this. "Defend world peace! Oppose American aggression!" In today's world, these are two sides of the same coin. These two slogans are consistent for the Chinese people and for the people of the world. But facing direct aggression, we cannot help but demand a special strengthening of animosity toward American imperialists.

　　保卫世界和平！反对美国侵略！
    编者
    美国帝国主义者不顾我周外长的历次抗议，继续扩大东方战争的火焰，在台湾和中朝边境正像两把刀一样插向我们中国，同时粗鲁地违犯联合国原则和联合国宪章，妄图把联合国会员国拖入军事冒险的道路，掀起新的世界大战。在这样严重的情势之下，中国人民对于美国帝国主义侵略者的深仇和对于世界和平的热爱在感情上是分不开的。反对美国侵略的实际行动已经成为中国保卫世界和平运动的基本内容了。
    战斗英雄马春雨在写给本报的信里说：“我们是坚决保卫世界和平的解放军，我们是全世界人民的力量。我们坚决反对美帝在朝鲜的侵略行为！如果美帝胆敢把战火烧向我们的国土，我们一定要它在火焰中毁灭！”铁路劳动模范田蕴华发表书面意见说：“美帝国主义像疯狗一样的咬人，他正加紧扩大侵略战争，企图走日寇侵略亚洲和中国的老路，来奴役中国人民。但是中国人民早已看破了美帝国主义的野心，早就知道他们的阴谋诡计。我们有毛主席和共产党的正确领导，有不可战胜的解放军，有坚强团结一致的人民，我们一定能够用铁锤打烂美帝侵略者的狗头。”这样的声音正足以代表当今热爱祖国的亿万中国人民的呼声。
    “中国保卫世界和平委员会”和“中国人民反对美国侵略台湾朝鲜委员会”于十月二十六日合并改组为“中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会”。显然，这是适应全国人民目前的心情和要求的。
    中国人民经历了长期战争的锻炼，具有消灭任何侵略者的坚定的信心和决心。近数月来，随着美国侵朝战争火焰的日益扩大，中国人民愈来愈多地用和平签名方式表现自己反对美国侵略的伟大意志和保卫世界和平的热烈感情。在斯德哥尔摩宣言上的签名人数在十月二十六日那一天就已超过中国和大所预定的争取二亿人的目标了。
    截至十月二十六日止，全国和平签名人数总计二亿零四百四十八万九千一百七十二人。据我们所知，全世界和平签名人数，在十月初旬就已达到五亿。由于近两旬来，中国及其他各国和平签名人数的继续增加，现在约计已近六亿人了。
    这一个世界史上没有先例的伟大的和平势力，进一步团结起来组织起来，进行不屈不挠的斗争，是必然可以使美国侵略者毁灭在自己所掀起的火焰里的。下月间将在伦敦召开的第二届世界保卫和平大会的方向就在此。“保卫世界和平！反对美国侵略！”在今日的世界正是一个问题的两面。这两个口号，对于中国人民，对于世界人民，都并行不悖。但在直接面临侵略的我们却就不得不要求特别加强对于美国帝国主义者的敌忾心了。
