Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 4th. More than one thousand overseas Chinese residing in Thailand and French-occupied Vietnam have been forced to return to China due to the persecution and plunder by the Thai Phibunsongkhram government and the French occupation authorities in Vietnam. They arrived in Shantou on October 23rd. Among them, 669 were returnees from Thailand, and 384 were returnees from French-occupied Vietnam.

According to returnees from French-occupied Vietnam, with the growing strength and victorious advance of the Vietnamese People's Army, the French army is now stepping up its instigation of secret agents to closely monitor and persecute overseas Chinese, and a atmosphere of terror pervades the French-occupied areas. During the recent celebration of the National Day of our motherland by overseas Chinese, six overseas Chinese students from the Saigon-Dike Chinese-French School were unreasonably arrested by the French army, severely beaten, and detained in prison. More than ten students from the Saigon Fujian Middle School were forced to secretly celebrate National Day under the oppression of French imperialism. Three students were arrested, including female student Hu Xueqin, who was subjected to torture by the French army.
