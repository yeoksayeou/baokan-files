　　All Circles of Women in Beijing
    Establish Organization to Resist America and Aid Korea
    Women From All Circles Express Determination to Defend the Homeland
    [Report from this newspaper] A surge of enthusiasm for the movement to resist America, aid Korea, protect the homeland, and defend the country has been ignited among women from all walks of life in Beijing. On the afternoon of the 9th, the "Beijing Women's Circles' Committee to Resist America, Aid Korea, Protect the Homeland, and Defend the Country" was officially established at the Municipal Democratic Women's Federation. The committee included ninety representatives of female workers, peasant women, female students, female teachers, female cadres, medical workers, childcare workers, and literary and artistic workers. At the meeting, Comrade Zhang Xiaomei, the chairperson, pointed out: "Now that American imperialism has invaded our land, the declarations made by all parties represent the will of all the Chinese people and also represent the will of our women. Therefore, we should fully support this declaration. Chinese women have been tested and tempered throughout history, and have made great contributions, especially during the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation, sending their sons and husbands to join the army and shouldering the work at the front and in the rear. Today, we must inherit this glorious tradition and resolutely smash the aggression of American imperialism. In addition to voluntarily joining the volunteer army, we must use various concrete actions to resist the United States, support Korea, and pay attention to conducting in-depth propaganda and education so that this movement becomes a widespread mass movement." Women from all walks of life spoke enthusiastically, and many units have already established their own organizations to resist America and aid Korea, and unanimously requested the organization of a unified women's organization to lead and promote this movement. Female comrades from the Clothing Factory, the People's Printing Factory, and the Drawnwork Factory told everyone in their speeches that the female workers have already launched a warm patriotic production competition to increase output, ensure quality, and reduce costs. The output of the Clothing Factory has exceeded the standard output (seven sets) by two to six sets. Female workers in all factories are actively signing up to volunteer for the army, and guarantee to work diligently before joining the army. Zhao Shufang, a representative of the Student Union, said, "Now the students are vying to join the volunteer army, and the female students are not lagging behind at all." Pu Jiexiu, vice-chairman of the Women's Friendship Association, said, "The Women's Friendship Association has already organized more than forty people into propaganda, comfort, transportation, and rescue teams, waiting for work." Li Jiansheng, vice-chairman of the Friendship Association, continued, "Homemakers should express their attitude, not only should they encourage their husbands and children to join the army, but they should also shoulder the burden of life, so that they can go with peace of mind and reassurance. Doing a good job in their positions will guarantee the defeat of American imperialism." Rong Junzhan, chairman of the preparatory committee of the Peking University Family Women's Association, said, "We must dedicate our entire bodies to support the volunteer army, whether at the front or in the rear, and defeat American imperialism as soon as possible." Kang, an elderly woman of a martyr's family, is fifty-seven years old this year. She said, "I am very heartbroken that American imperialism is invading us. My son and daughter have already volunteered to join the volunteer army. I encourage them to inherit the spirit of their father, and I also want to join the army. Although I can't carry a gun, I can do logistics work. I know that without a country, there is no home." Chou Zigang, director of the Military Commission Nursery, said, "Now childcare work is very important. We must protect the children of parents who volunteer to resist America and aid Korea so that they are healthy and lively, so that their parents can work with more peace of mind." Chen Wenrun, general secretary of the Young Women's Christian Association, said in her speech that she is a Christian and opposes wars of aggression, and today she will also mobilize everyone to do concrete work to resist America and aid Korea.
    Comrade Wang Fujin, a cadre from the Twelfth District, reported that the emancipated peasant women in the suburbs resent the aggression of American imperialism against Korea and China, and many people have signed up to volunteer for the army. Suburban cadres also guarantee that they will do a good job in grain requisition this year, and actively mobilize women to participate in sideline production in winter to support the front. Comrade Luo Di, a female cadre from the Municipal Government, said: More than half of us have requested to join the volunteer army. Now everyone is stepping up their work, making one person do the work of two or three people, and we must also do propaganda at any time. Yang Jing, from the Beijing Film Studio, said: Many staff members in our factory have polished their machines. They said: The film camera is our weapon, and we are ready to go to the airport to photograph the heroic deeds to tell the people of China and the world. Xiao Baiyushuang, a female artist from the Ping Opera circle, said: "We must use the weapon of art to do propaganda and are determined to fight American imperialism to the end." Everyone scrambled to speak, unanimously expressing their determination to resist America, aid Korea, protect the homeland, and defend the country with practical actions. On the spot, 36 standing committee members were elected. After the meeting, the Standing Committee was convened immediately, and Zhang Xiaomei was elected as chairperson, Yang Zaoxin, Yang Baojun, Pu Jiexiu, Yu Xiu'ai, and Lao Junzhan as vice-chairpersons, Li Jiansheng as secretary-general, and Guo Yu and Liu Junying as deputy secretary-generals. The Standing Committee has established four departments: Propaganda, Liaison, Action, and Secretariat, and will begin work immediately.
