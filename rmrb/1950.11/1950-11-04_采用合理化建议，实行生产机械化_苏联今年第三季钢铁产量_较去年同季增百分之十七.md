Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 3rd: A comprehensive report from TASS Moscow: The output of various Soviet steel factories in the third quarter of this year increased by more than 17% compared to the same period last year. The increase in steel output is due to the Soviet Union's widespread adoption of rationalization proposals from steelworkers, the implementation of production mechanization, and the use of the latest Soviet-made equipment. In the first half of this year, steelworkers have already put forward tens of thousands of rationalization proposals, which have greatly improved the productivity of metallurgical machinery and extended the life of open-hearth furnaces and blast furnaces. Due to the implementation of these rationalization proposals, the productivity of open-hearth furnaces nationwide has increased by 15% to 20% compared to two years ago, saving 40% of costs compared to last year.

The Soviet Union has established the world's first fully mechanized metal rolling enterprise. All steelmaking furnaces in major Soviet metallurgical enterprises, such as the Moscow Hammer and Sickle Factory and the Ural Magnitogorsk Factory, have been fully mechanized. At the beginning of this year, blast furnaces equipped with the latest automatic equipment produced 85% of the country's total milled iron output; open-hearth furnaces, accounting for 80% of the total steel output, have been automated.

　　采用合理化建议，实行生产机械化
    苏联今年第三季钢铁产量较去年同季增百分之十七
    【新华社三日讯】综合塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联各钢铁工厂今年第三季的产量，较去年同期增加了百分之十七以上。钢铁产量的增加，是由于苏联广泛采用了炼钢工人的合理化建议，实行生产的机械化，和使用苏联最新的制造的设备之故。今年上半年炼钢工人已提出了数万件合理化建议，这些建议大大提高了冶金机器的生产率，和延长了马丁炉及鼓风炉的寿命。由于实行这些合理化建议，全国马丁炉的生产率已较两年前增高了百分之十五到二十，较去年节省了百分之四十的费用。
    苏联已首次建立了世界上完全机械化的金属辗制企业。苏联的重要冶金企业，如莫斯科的锤子与镰刀工厂和乌拉尔的马格尼托哥尔斯克工厂的全部炼钢炉，均已完全机械化。今年年初，装有最新式的自动设备的高炉，就生产了全国铣铁总产量的百分之八十五；占钢产总量百分之八十的马丁炉已经自动化。
