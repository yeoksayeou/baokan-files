Shandong Middle School promotes patriotic thought in the streets, Xu Guochen speaks on the spot to accuse American imperialist atrocities

[Report from this newspaper] "Carry out the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement to the rural areas surrounding Beijing" has become the glorious task of teachers and students from Tsinghua, Yenching, Beijing Agricultural University and other schools. Yenching and Beijing Agricultural University are actively preparing. Yenching has decided to go to the countryside on the 17th. Under the leadership of the student union, each department has established an anti-American aggression branch to organize students. According to their respective strengths, they form groups for singing, performing dramas, and writing propaganda. Through self-study of documents, chats, discussions, debates, and giving reports, students themselves first gain a clear understanding of this great movement. The Department of Chemical Engineering has prepared eleven programs, including living newspapers, rhyming dialogues, magic lantern shows, clapper talks, and magic tricks. Seventy-eight of the eighty-one students in the department have voluntarily requested to participate in the study. Eighty percent of the students in the Department of Civil Engineering have also decided to go to the countryside.

Tsinghua teachers and students have begun to carry out extensive rural propaganda since the 12th. More than 2,600 students in the school are organized into 33 propaganda teams. Twenty-six teams, a total of more than 1,700 students, were dispatched on the 12th. Professors from each department also went to the countryside with the students. With Tsinghua Garden as the center, all the villages within 12 li around it have Tsinghua students doing propaganda.

Before going to the countryside, the students made intensive preparations. Almost every team prepared living dramas, magic lantern shows, clapper talks, crosstalk... Every student participated in specific preparatory work. Each team also held group meetings to study how to conduct in-depth family visits in rural areas.

On the 12th, there was a strong wind, but the students' enthusiasm for work was not affected at all. For example, first- and third-year students in the Department of Physics, in order to catch the morning market in Landianchang, set off at 5 a.m., started propaganda at 7:30 a.m., and then went to a mass meeting nearby at 9 a.m. They worked continuously for nine hours in the cold wind on empty stomachs, and everyone enthusiastically conducted work reviews.

Various programs vividly portrayed the sacred task of resisting America and aiding Korea to defend the country in front of the masses, arousing their deep concern about the current situation. An old lady in Yimuyuan said: "Yes, we finally waited for the whole country to be liberated, and we are watching our lives get better. This America is really hateful!" Then an old villager said: "If we want to protect these few acres of land, we must help Korea. Our peasants must do a good job in production, engage in more sideline businesses, and hand in more public grain to support the Korean people in resisting American aggression."

The Wenquan Elementary School for the children of employees of the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry held a costumed propaganda meeting to resist America and aid Korea in Wenquan Village in the western suburbs at 10:00 a.m. on the 9th. It also cooperated with the village government to promote the work of collecting public grain. About 800 villagers, men, women, and children, participated. They unanimously expressed their hatred for American imperialism. An old lady said: "America deserves to die! We are just about to have a good life, and they come to bully us again." Another old lady continued: "I guarantee to hand in public grain on time, so that our volunteer troops can fight these damned American devils." A demonstration parade was held in the afternoon, and the masses actively participated in the procession. The shouts of resisting America and aiding Korea to defend the country resounded through the wilderness.

[Another News Item] On the 11th, more than 800 teachers and students from Shandong Middle School, divided into four teams, conducted current affairs propaganda with Tiananmen Square as the center, south to Qianmen and north to Beihai. The propaganda content infused anti-American and patriotic thoughts, which moved the masses very much.

When the second team performed a living drama of American imperialism slaughtering the Korean people for the masses at Qianmen Railway Station, Comrade Xu Guochen, a driver from the Linjiang Locomotive Depot in Northeast China, was also present. He was one of the victims of the American air raid on the Northeast on August 27. After watching the drama, he automatically spoke to the masses. He powerfully accused the crimes of American imperialism with his hand crippled by the enemy's bombing. When the masses saw his left hand raised above his head, with only one finger left, everyone was extremely angry; some were even so excited that they cried. Comrade Xu Guochen said in a firm tone: "I will use this one hand to take revenge! Use this one hand to build our motherland!" At this time, there was a storm of applause and thunderous shouts: "We will avenge Comrade Xu Guochen!" "We will avenge the sacrificed people of the Northeast!" "Drive the American imperialists out of Asia!"

A total of 15 propaganda sessions were held, with about 6,000 listeners. In the morning at 8 o'clock, all the teachers and students of the school made final preparations and inspections, and at 11 o'clock, they left the school. In the afternoon at 4 o'clock, each team victoriously converged at Tiananmen Square and returned. The students' emotions have been very high, and many were so excited that they forgot to eat lunch; even the smallest children did not say they were tired.

　　清华师生下乡宣传抗美援朝
　  山东中学在街头宣传爱国思想徐国臣当场讲话控诉美帝暴行
    【本报讯】“把抗美援朝运动开展到京郊农村去”，成了目前清华、燕京、北京农大等校师生的光荣任务。燕京、农大正在积极准备。燕京决定十七日下乡。现在在学生会领导下，各系纷纷成立了反美侵略支会，将同学们组织起来。根据各人的擅长，组成歌咏、演剧、文字宣传等组。通过自学文件、漫谈、讨论、辩论及作报告，使同学自己首先对这一伟大的运动认识清楚。化工系已经准备了十一个节目，包括活报、数来宝、拉洋片、快板、变戏法等。全系八十一个同学有七十八个自动要求参加学习。土木系也有百分之八十的同学决定下乡。
    清华师生，从十二日起，已开始进行广泛的农村宣传。全校二千六百多个同学，组织成三十三个宣传队。十二日出动了二十六个队，共一千七百多个同学。各系的先生们也和同学一起下乡。以清华园为中心，周围十二里以内所有的村庄，都有清华同学在宣传。
    下乡以前，同学们进行了紧张的准备。几乎每个队都准备了活报剧、洋片、快板、相声……。每个同学都参加了具体的准备工作。各小队又开了小组会，研究如何到农村进行深入的家庭访问。
    十二日遇到大风，可是同学们的工作热情丝毫没受影响。如物理系一、三年级同学，为了赶蓝靛厂的早集，清晨五点出发，七点半开始宣传，九点又去附近参加群众大会。在寒风中饿着肚子连续工作了九小时，大家还很热烈地作了工作检讨。
    各种各样的节目，形象地把抗美援朝保家卫国的神圣任务表现在群众面前，引起了他们对目前形势的深刻关心。一亩园一位老大娘说：“是啊，咱们好容易盼着全国都解放了，眼看着日子就好过了。这美国真可恨！”接着一位老乡说：“咱们要保住这几亩地，就非得帮助朝鲜不可。咱们农民要搞好生产，多搞副业，多交公粮，支援朝鲜人民抗击美国侵略。”
    中央重工业部职工子弟温泉小学，于九日十时，到西郊温泉村，召开了抗美援朝化装宣传大会。并配合村政府，宣传了征收公粮工作。村中农民，男女老幼，约有八百余人参加。一致表示了对美帝的痛恨。一个老太太说：“美国太该死了！我们刚要过好日子，又来欺侮我们。”另一个老太太接着说：“我保证按时缴公粮，好叫我们的志愿部队去打这该死的美国鬼子。”午后举行示威游行，群众纷纷自动参加行列。抗美援朝，保家卫国的吼声，响彻原野。

    【又讯】十一日，山东中学师生八百余人，分四队，以天安门广场为中心，南至前门，北至北海，进行了时事宣传。宣传内容贯注了仇美、爱国的思想，使群众甚为感动。
    第二大队在前门车站为群众演出美帝屠杀朝鲜人民的活报剧时，东北临江机务段司机徐国臣同志也在场。他是八月二十七日美机轰炸东北时被难者之一。他看了剧后，自动向群众讲话。他用被敌人炸残废了的手，有力地控诉了美帝的罪行。群众看见他举在头上，只剩下了一个手指头的左手时，大家都极为气愤；有的更激动得哭了起来。徐国臣同志用坚定的语调说：“我还要用这一只手来报仇！用这一只手来建设我们的祖国！”这时四周围响起了暴风雨般的掌声和雷动的呼声：“我们要为徐国臣同志报仇！”“我们要为牺牲了的东北人民报仇！”“把美帝赶出亚洲去！”
    这次宣传先后共十五场，听众约六千余人。早晨八时全校师生作了最后的准备和检查，十一时出校，午后四时各队胜利会师于天安门广场而返。同学们的情绪一直很高涨，有很多激奋得忘记了吃午饭；连最小的小同学也没有一个说累的。
