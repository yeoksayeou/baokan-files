　　The Power of the Soviet State Against Aggression!
    ——Introduction to "The Fall of Berlin" (Part 1)
    Huang Gang
    The color film "The Fall of Berlin" is about to be shown simultaneously in major cities across our country. This has particular and important significance today.
    This film, whether judged by its artistic achievements or by its impact on the political and cultural life of the people of the world, has immense international significance. The production of this film is, artistically, a further testament to the genuine flourishing of the Soviet cinematic epic style, and once again demonstrates the authors' high level of talent in creating magnificent artistic documentaries. The film itself marks a new step forward in the development of Soviet cinema. As Bagozhieva said in her review of "The Fall of Berlin": "For Soviet film art critics and historians, M. Chiaureli's new film is the most important subject of study." To clarify that series of topics and to learn the most important characteristics of the new realist method from them, another article is needed for specialized discussion. Here, the main focus is on its primary significance for its premiere today.
    "The Fall of Berlin" tells us that the most important key to determining the victory or defeat of the Second World War lay in the nature of the war, the justice of the war, its popular character, and, from the Soviet side, the unparalleled superiority of the Soviet state and the Soviet social system compared to Hitler's Germany. "The Fall of Berlin" introduces us in a concentrated way to ordinary yet good Soviet people—they are heroes in labor, soldiers defending the motherland. They take up arms to resist foreign enemies because someone has disrupted the peace of their sun-drenched country, deprived them of the freedom to create through labor, and taken away their loved ones, sending them to concentration camps... Yes, it is these ordinary peace-loving people, once the imperialists invade them, who will turn from the steel furnace, from the production front, to "producing and manufacturing German corpses!" (Words of the male lead in the film.) The protagonist, Ivanov, when returning to the doorstep of his hometown, which was razed to ruins by the German bandits, said angrily: "Germans, do you hear me? Your Berlin will only be left as a pile of earth, and don't say I'm cruel then. I didn't invade anyone, and I didn't invade you! I'm kind. Beast, just don't speak, don't say a word!..."
    This he said to a captured soldier of the fascist German army. This aspiration of ordinary soldier Ivanov is completely consistent with the thinking of his country and army leader, Comrade Stalin: "Now the Red Army only needs to carry out the last mission—Stalin said in 1944—to carry the cause of crushing the German fascist army to the end, to kill the fascist beast in its lair, and to raise the flag of victory high in Berlin." History has proven the correctness of the aspirations of Ivanov and his leader: the capture of Berlin saved all of humanity! Democratic Germany was reborn, and fascist Germany was crushed! The basic idea of the film is to affirm that "the unity of social morality and politics, the unity of the people and the Party, the unity of the people and the leader, is the most important factor in determining the Soviet historical victory over Hitler's Germany." The film runs through the infinitely strong unity of the people and the leader from beginning to end, emphasizing the socialist democracy and the Soviet people's way of thinking.
    Our people and our neighbors—the Korean people who are fighting heroically—can draw great encouragement from this film. We might as well see how Hitler shouted in "The Fall of Berlin." When the army was approaching Moscow, Hitler said: "The door to Russia has been opened. I want to turn the clock of history forward a hundred years. Communism will be wiped out by me forever." The result was the opposite. The war proved that the Soviet Red Army is the first-class army in the world; it proved that the fascist army, which carries out colonial plunder and wields murderous machines to coerce the territories of others, cannot have any reliable and lasting combat effectiveness; Hitler's end was like this, and the end of Hitler's loyal students, the likes of Truman and MacArthur, will also be like this. The people of our country, and the people of the world democratic and peace camp, will realize from the film "The Fall of Berlin" that the source of the powerful force of armed forces is not only in the weapons themselves, but also in the entire experience, leadership, command, skills, and morale of the army, and also in the consolidation of the rear and the quantity and quality of reserve divisions, and that victory can only be achieved when the people's perseverance and unity in war surpass the enemy. "The Fall of Berlin" provides us with factors that often play a role on the road to victory: the will of the people at home to resist aggression, the fighting spirit of an army composed of people who hold weapons and deeply understand why they are fighting, and the support of the people of the world, which is the most important point. This is the first educational significance that "The Fall of Berlin" gives us.
    Secondly, "The Fall of Berlin" correctly portrays the faces of today's warmongers, quickly turning our attention from facts not long ago to the present. This film—a faithful historical documentary—announced to the world: even when the German bandits were attacking Moscow, Hitler admitted: "American authorities are supporting us." Hitler understood that he was attacking the Soviet Union, doing things for Washington and London. The film shows that even when the fighting in Stalingrad was at its fiercest, British political brokers were there promising to supply Hitler with tungsten and chromium, allowing the German fascist mechanized troops to use them to manufacture armor. This film writes with extraordinary fairness that such negotiations between imperialist countries at that time were not just "commercial" negotiations. At the Yalta Conference, Churchill was constantly concocting treacherous schemes to reap benefits and kill with a borrowed knife. Since the beginning of the Soviet-German war, the facts are like this: in the autumn of 1941 and in 1942 and 1943, in Lisbon and Switzerland, British representatives, and later American representatives, had secretly negotiated a separate peace with German envoys behind the backs of the Soviet Union, they discussed the criminal plan of using "traffic blockade lines" to oppose "Bolshevism and Pan-Slavism," discussed the conspiracy to establish a "Greater Germany and Danube Alliance," and other such crimes. The reason why the American and British imperialists did not hesitate to use the blood of the Soviet people and their own people as chips for these betrayals of allied countries, while at the same time delaying the opening of the second front as much as possible, was closely related to their estimates of the Soviet army's combat effectiveness. Stalin said in 1946, when summarizing the victory of the Patriotic War: "Everyone knows that famous figures in foreign newspapers, as well as many so-called authorities in military affairs abroad, repeatedly stated: the situation of the Red Army is doubtful, the Red Army's armament is poor, there are no truly capable commanding cadres, it cannot withstand any criticism, it may be able to defend, but it is useless when attacking. It was said that when it was hit by the German army, it would collapse like a clay giant, not only in Germany were there such statements, but also in France, Britain, and the United States. Now we can say that the war has overturned all these absurd and ridiculous statements." (Speech before voters) And during the war, Truman, who was then a senator from Missouri, said this: "If we see that Germany is going to win, we should help Russia, and if Russia is going to win, we should help Germany, so that we can let them kill each other as much as possible." Because of this, we can see in the film that before the Battle of Berlin, Hitler and Goebbels did not place their "confidence" in the ochre-colored SS, but in the American and British imperialists, attempting to use all their forces to deal with the Soviet army, wanting to hand over the empty city to Churchill and the American army, surrendering to them without resistance. Churchill also repeatedly intended to obstruct the Soviet army's attack on Berlin at the Yalta Conference. Hitler was hoping that Britain and the United States would "clash with the Soviet Union around Berlin and tear each other apart before my eyes." But the wise Stalin saw through all this. In this film, as if we saw it with our own eyes, we saw Stalin ordering the deployment of enough equipment—encircling Berlin like iron rings and capturing it. The following is a brief description of the capture of Berlin from the book "A Brief History of the Soviet Army":
    On the enemy's side: "The entire area from the Oder River to Berlin was densely covered with defenses. On the Soviet army's road to Berlin, there were deep anti-tank trenches, endless iron rail forts, countless tripwires, and hundreds of mined areas. In the capital city streets of Germany, there were nine defense lines. All streets were built with barricades, intersections and squares were equipped with mines and fortifications, and subways and basements were turned into defensive fortifications. In the suburbs, an army of 500,000 men with a large amount of technical equipment was assembled."
    What about the Soviet army?
    "The Soviet Command meticulously prepared for the final battle. ... At four o'clock in the morning on April 16, 22,000 guns and mortars of various calibers began to bombard. The entire area shuddered as if an earthquake had occurred. Twenty minutes later, an unprecedentedly powerful light was emitted at the 66th Hill southwest of Küstrin. The German division commander reported to Berlin by radio, "Terrible fire is bombarding us. Contact with the regiments has been lost. An inexplicably powerful light appeared at one point, like hundreds of millions of candles. It is not yet clear what it is. It may be new weapons or chemical weapons..."
    In fact, it wasn't! It was "the Soviet Command dispatched more than two hundred powerful searchlights to the area. They simultaneously emitted light, confusing the German army. More than four thousand tanks were put into battle. The Soviet infantry followed and advanced. The wall of fire from 22,000 guns cleared the way for them. The Soviet Air Force flew 17,000 sorties on this day. This was the most destructive strike by the Soviet army during the entire war. "Comrades and friends, the character in the play you are already familiar with, the ordinary Russian soldier Ivanov, was in the ranks of such an attack.
    "The Fall of Berlin" is a film that reflects the history of the Soviet Union's great Patriotic War victory and the battle that determined the fate of mankind. It is a film depicting the fate of ordinary Soviet people closely linked to the victory of the motherland's cause. On the one hand, it accurately reflects many of the main stages of this final battle with unprecedented scale in the history of world cinema, and on the other hand, it carefully handles the theme of international diplomatic affairs and the struggles therein. The combination of these two forms a serious warning to the instigators of new wars of aggression today, and also fully cultivates the high level of self-confidence and vigilance of peace-loving people around the world. After watching the war example of "The Fall of Berlin" (which is an unparalleled model of Stalin's military science), one can know that the most barbaric and outrageous aggressors can be completely defeated, but we cannot relax our vigilance against the imperialists' aggressive conspiracies for a moment!
    But the great educational significance of "The Fall of Berlin" for us today does not stop there. It is permeated from beginning to end with the idea of loving peace and fighting for peace. The entire film depicts with magnificent colors the desires, emotions, and profound feelings of the Soviet people, the German people, and the European and American people for peace. And most importantly, it depicts the great leader, the gardener who cultivates the happy life of his own people, the greatest commander of all ages and nations who formulates great strategies, Comrade Stalin, he is the highest authority of all peace fighters in the world, and the concentrator of the peace aspirations of the people of the world. War itself is cruel, but Stalin issued the order to attack for peace. At the Yalta Conference, Stalin said to Churchill: "The people need peace, and we can and should give it to the people, and the sooner the better." Churchill said: "I don't like to be impatient: "Not to mention there is no need to be impatient!" Now, the American authorities, who have overturned Roosevelt's policy, are partnering with Churchill to push hundreds of millions of people into the flames of war. But the ending of "The Fall of Berlin" (which is also the ending of the political life after the previous World War) set off a raging wave of peaceful victory cheers among the people of the world; the liberated prisoners sang exciting and beloved songs:
    ——Stalin heard the children's moans,
    Sent warriors to liberate them.
    The warriors passed through the hail of bullets,
    Not sparing their lives.
    Warriors, commanders, our saviors, brothers, and comrades,
    We will never forget you,
    Comrade Stalin is our savior,
    He sent dear brothers to rescue us.
    We will never forget, never forget
    Russia's merit.
    This is the song of peace. It is also the world's people's praise for Stalin. The invincible Red Army danced in the streets of Berlin, they and the people of all Soviet nationalities and the people of European and American countries shouted: "Long live, Stalin!" The Red Army used songs to describe and summarize their victory: it was Stalin who led them "fearlessly through the flames of war, advancing like a torrent, like a spring breeze, ending the march with the victory of Berlin." At this time, Stalin repeatedly urged us: "We must defend peace, for the future. I wish you all peace and happiness, my friends!" Today, we must answer the American imperialists and all war-mongers in Stalin's own language. We have recognized that history has unfolded a broad road before us, and all ethnic groups and all people in China will fight for the peace of China, the Far East, and the world; for the happiness of the whole world, all mankind, and also for the happiness of all our Chinese people. Because we are engaged in a just struggle, because the combined strength of all our people and the combined strength of the world's peace and democratic camp greatly exceed the murderous machines held by the American imperialists, and because the peace and democratic front has the leadership of Stalin, Mao Zedong, and the democratic leaders of various countries, we will surely achieve victory.

　　苏维埃国家反侵略的威力！
    ——《攻克柏林》介绍之一
    黄钢
    《攻克柏林》彩色影片，即将在我国各大城市同时上演。这在今天有着特殊重要的意义。
    这部影片，无论就他的艺术成就说，无论就它对世界人民政治生活与文化生活的影响说，都有莫大的国际意义。这部电影的产生，在艺术上是进一步证明了苏联电影史诗样式的真正繁荣，再一次表明了作者们创立宏伟规模的艺术记录片的高度才能。这影片本身，就标明了苏联电影向前发展的新的跨步。正如包戈日叶娃在评《攻克柏林》文中说的：“对于苏维埃电影艺术批评家和历史家来说，Ｍ·乔列里的新片子乃是最紧要的研究课题。”为了阐明那一连串课题，并从中学得新现实主义方法的最主要特征，需要另写文章来专门讨论。这里，主要是谈谈它在今天上演的首要意义。
    《攻克柏林》告诉我们，决定第二次世界大战胜败最主要的关键，是在战争的性质、战争的正义性、全民性而在苏联方面说来，是苏维埃国家与苏维埃社会体制比较起希特勒德国的无比优越性。《攻克柏林》中向我们集中介绍了普通而又善良的苏联人民——他们是劳动中的英雄、保卫祖国的战士。他们拿起枪来抵抗外敌，是因为有人破坏了他们阳光普照的国家的安静，剥夺了他们劳动创造的自由，抢走了他的爱人并把他送到集中营……是的，就是这些普通的爱好和平的人民，帝国主义者一旦侵犯了他们，他们就会从炼钢炉旁，从生产战线上转向“生产和制造德国人的尸首！”（片中男主角语）主角伊凡诺夫，在回到他那被德寇平为废墟的故乡家门口的时候，他愤恨地说道：“德国人，你听见我的话了吗？你的柏林只会剩下一堆土，到那时候你也别说我残忍。我没有侵犯别人，我也没侵犯你！我善良。畜生，你就别说话吧，一句话也别说！……”
    这是他对着法西斯德军的一个俘虏兵说的。普通士兵伊凡诺夫的这一志愿，与他的国家和军队的领导者斯大林同志的思想是完全一致的：“现在红军只须执行最后一个使命——斯大林在一九四四年说过——把粉碎德国法西斯军队的事业进行到底，把法西斯野兽打死于其巢穴中，并在柏林高竖起胜利的旗帜。”历史证明了伊凡诺夫及其领袖的志愿之正确：攻克了柏林，拯救了全人类！民主的德国获得新生，而法西斯德国是被粉碎了！影片的基本思想，就是肯定了“社会道德与政治的统一、人民与党的统一、人民与领袖的统一，乃是决定苏维埃战胜希特勒德国的历史性胜利的最主要因素”。影片从头到尾贯串着人民与领袖的无比坚强的团结，着重地宣扬了社会主义的民主与苏联人民的思想的方式。
    我国的人民和我们的近邻——正在英勇斗争中的朝鲜人民，可以从这影片中得到极大的鼓励。我们不妨看看《攻克柏林》中的希特勒曾经是怎样叫喊的。兵临莫斯科城下时，希特勒曾说道：“俄国的大门已经打开了。我要把那历史的钟。向前拨一百年。共产主义，将要永远地被我消灭掉了。”结果是适得其反。战争证明了苏联红军是世界上的第一等军队；证明了进行殖民掠夺和手执杀人机械威迫他人领土的法西斯军队，不可能有任何可靠持久的战斗力；希特勒的下场如此，希特勒的忠实学生杜鲁门、麦克阿瑟之流的下场，亦将如此。我国人民、和世界民主和平阵营的人民，将从《攻克柏林》片中认识到：武装力量强大威力的源泉，不仅是在武器本身，还要看军队整个的经验、领导、指挥、技能和士气，还要看后方的巩固性与后备师团的数量和质量，还要在战争中人民的坚忍力和团结一致都胜过敌人的时候，才能取胜。《攻克柏林》向我们提供了在致胜道路上经常起作用的因素：就是国内人民反侵略的意志、由手持武器深懂得自己是为什么而战的人民组成的军队的斗志、和全世界人民的支援，这是最紧要的一点。这是《攻克柏林》给予我们的头一个教育意义。
    其次，《攻克柏林》给我们正确地描出了今天的战争贩子们的嘴脸，使我们的注意力从不久以前的事实迅速转向现在。这部影片——忠实的历史记录文献——向全世界公布了：还在德寇进攻莫斯科时，希特勒承认：“美国的权威人士支持着我们。”希特勒理解：他进攻苏联，是在替华盛顿和伦敦做事。影片表明：还在斯大林格勒打得最激烈时，英国的政治掮客却正在那里答应以钨和铬供给希特勒，让德国法西斯的机械化部队用以制造铁甲。这部影片异常公正地写出：当时帝国主义国家间的这种谈判，不止是“商业”上的谈判。在雅尔塔会议上，邱吉尔随时都在编造坐收渔利与借刀杀人的奸计。自从苏、德战争开始以来，事实是这样：一九四一年秋和一九四二、一九四三年，在里斯本和瑞士，英国的代表，以后，又有美国的代表，都曾背着苏联，和德国的密使商议单独讲和，他们讨论过以“交通隔断线”反对“布尔什维主义与泛斯拉夫主义”的罪恶计划，讨论过成立“大德国与多瑙河联盟”的阴谋，以及其他类此的罪行。美英帝国主义者之所以不惜以苏联人民与本国人民的鲜血为筹码，来进行这些背叛盟国的交易，同时这以前又尽量地拖延开辟第二战场，这是与他们对苏军战斗力的估计有密切关系的。斯大林在一九四六年总结爱国战争的胜利时曾说过：“大家知道：外国报纸的著名要人，以及国外很多军事方面的所谓权威家，屡屡声称：红军的情况令人怀疑，红军的武装窳劣，没有真正干练的指挥干部，受不了任何批评，也许可以防守，但是进攻时则不中用。说在受到德军打击时，就会像泥塑的巨人一样垮台，不仅是在德国有这样的声明，在法国、英国、美国也都有过这样的声明。现在我们可以说，战争已经推翻了这一切荒谬可笑的声明”。（在选民前的演说）而在战争时期，曾在米苏里州任参议员的杜鲁门就这样说道：如果我们看着德国要胜利，我们就当帮助俄国，如果俄国要胜利，我们就当帮助德国，这样就可以叫他们尽可能地多相撕杀。”正因为如此，我们可以在影片中看到，希特勒和戈培尔在柏林之战以前，他们的“信心”不是寄托在赭色党卫军身上，而是寄托在美英帝国主义身上，企图把全部兵力对付苏军，想让出空城送给邱吉尔和美国的军队，毫不抵抗地就对他们投降。邱吉尔在雅尔塔会议上也一再地意图阻碍苏军进攻柏林。希特勒是指望英美两国与苏联在柏林周围“冲突起来，互相撕杀在我的眼前。”但智慧的斯大林识破了这一切。我们在这影片中，就如同亲眼见到的那样，看见斯大林下令调度了足够的装备——好像铁环一样地包围了柏林而且攻占了它。以下就是《苏军简史》一书中关于攻占柏林一节简短的描绘：
    在敌人方面：“从奥得河到柏林的整个地区密布了防线。在苏军通往柏林的道上，摆满了深的防坦克壕，一望无边的铁轨砦，无数的绊索，成百的敷雷区。在德国首都市街中，就有九道防线。所有一切的街道都筑有街垒，交叉路和广场都设有地雷和工事，地下铁路和地下室都变成了防御工事。在城郊集结了附有大量技术装备的五十万大军。”
    苏军方面怎么样呢？
    “苏军统帅部周密地准备了最后的战役。……四月十六日早晨四点钟，二万二千门各种口径的大炮和迫击炮开始了轰击。整个地区好像地震一样发起抖来。二十分钟后，在久斯特林西南方的六六高地上发出从未见过的强大光芒。德军师长用无线电话报告柏林“可怕的火力向我们轰击。同各团丧失了连系。在一个地点上出现了莫明其妙的强大光芒，好像亿万支蜡烛一样。究竟是什么还未搞清。可能是新武器或是化学武器……”
    其实，还不是呢！是“苏军统帅部向这个地区调来了二百多个强有力的探照灯。它们同时发出光芒迷惑了德军。四千多辆坦克投入战斗。苏军的步兵随后推进。二万二千门炮的火墙为他们扫清了道路。苏联空军在这一天飞行了一万七千次。这是苏军在整个战争期间最具有歼灭性的一次突击。奥得河上的德军战线崩溃了。”观众同志们，朋友们，你所已经熟悉的戏中的人物，俄国普通的士兵伊凡诺夫，他就在这样进攻的队伍之中。
    《攻克柏林》就是这样反映苏联伟大的爱国战争胜利的历史和反映决定人类命运的战役的影片。是描写普通的苏维埃人的命运与祖国事业的胜利紧密相连的影片。它一方面是以世界电影史上空前的规模来确切地反映了这最后一战的许多主要阶段，另一方面，又精细地处理了当时国际外交事务及其中的斗争的主题。而这两者结合起来，就形成了对今天新的侵略战争挑拨者的严重的警告，而且也就充分培养了全世界爱好和平人民的高度自信心与警惕性。看了《攻克柏林》这一个战例（这是斯大林军事科学的一个无比典范），就能知道：最野蛮最放肆的侵略者是可以完全打败的，但我们对于帝国主义者的侵略阴谋是一刻也不能放松警惕！
    但《攻克柏林》今天对我们的伟大教育意义还不止此。它从头到尾都被热爱和平，为和平而斗争的思想贯串着。全部影片以绚烂的色彩描写了苏联人民、德国人民、欧美人民热爱和平的愿望、情绪与深刻的感情。而且最主要的，是写出了伟大的领袖，培养自己祖国人民幸福生活的园丁、制定伟大战略的各时代各民族最伟大的统帅斯大林同志，他是全世界一切和平战士的最高权威，是全世界人民和平志愿的集中者。战争本身是残酷的，但斯大林是为了和平而下攻击令。在雅尔塔会议上斯大林对邱吉尔说：“人民需要和平，我们能够也应该把它交给人民，并且愈快愈好。”邱吉尔却说：“我不欢喜性急：“更何况用不着性急！”现在呢，推翻了罗斯福政策的美国当权者与邱吉尔打伙，想把亿万人民推入战争的火焰之中。但是《攻克柏林》一片的结局（也是前一次世界大战后政治生活的一个结局）是在世界各国人民群众中掀起了狂浪一样的和平的胜利的欢呼；被解放的囚徒们唱着激动人心的敬爱的歌子：
    ——斯大林听见了子女的呻吟，
    派来战士解放他们。
    战士们穿过枪林弹雨，
    不惜自己的生命。
    战士，指战员，救命恩人兄弟同志们，
    我们永远不会忘记你们，
    斯大林同志是我们救命恩人，
    他派来了亲爱的弟兄们来解救我们。
    我们永远不会忘记，不会忘记
    俄国的功绩。
    这就是和平的歌声。也是世界人民对斯大林的赞颂。无敌的红军在柏林的街上跳舞，他们和苏联各民族人民及欧美各国人民喊着：“万岁，斯大林！”红军用歌声形容和总结了自己的胜利：是斯大林领导他们“无畏的穿过了战争的火焰，像狂澜、春风样前进，以柏林的胜利结束了行军。”到此时，斯大林一再叮嘱我们：“我们要保卫和平，为了未来。祝你们全体和平幸福，我的朋友们！”到今天，我们一定以斯大林同样的语言来回答美帝国主义同全世界一切战争贩子。我们已经认清：历史已经在我们面前展开了宽阔的道路，我们中国各个民族，全体人民，都会为了中国的、远东的、世界的和平而斗争；为全世界、全人类、也为我们全中国人民的幸福而斗争。因为我们进行的正义的斗争，因为我们全国人民力量的总合、全世界和平民主阵营力量的总合大大超过了美帝国主义者所手持的杀人机器，又因为和平民主阵线有着斯大林、毛泽东和各国人民民主领袖的领导，我们是一定会取得胜利的。
