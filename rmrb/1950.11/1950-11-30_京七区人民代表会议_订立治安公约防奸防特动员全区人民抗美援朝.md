    [Our Newspaper's Dispatch] According to the Beijing Municipal News Agency: The second session of the People's Representatives Conference of All Circles in Beijing's No. 7 District, which opened at 1:00 PM on the 26th, successfully concluded at 7:00 PM on the 27th. The conference embodied the will and determination of the 100,000 people in the district to resist America, aid Korea, protect their homes, and defend the country.

    In their speeches at the conference, representatives from all circles condemned the crimes of American imperialism in invading Korea and China from various perspectives. They unanimously expressed their intention to carry out mobilization and propaganda work for resisting America and aiding Korea, and called on the people of the whole district to use letters and goods to express their regards to the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army aiding Korea.
    The conference believes that assisting the government in strengthening public security is a common and important task for the people of the whole district in the movement to resist America and aid Korea. Only when the people of the whole district are mobilized, so that bandits and special agents have no opportunity to take advantage of and nowhere to go, can we thoroughly consolidate revolutionary order, prevent harm that everyone may suffer, and ensure the smooth progress of production, and fully support the great patriotic movement to resist America and aid Korea. Therefore, the conference established five public security pacts, calling on the people of the whole district to abide by them: 1. Strengthen the prevention of spies and special agents: Do not fail to report households, do not hide bad people, monitor the activities of special agents, and report suspicious elements. 2. Protect the safety of factories and prevent sabotage by special agents. 3. Do not believe rumors, and immediately report to the government when you discover bad people spreading rumors. 4. Improve fire prevention equipment and be careful with stoves and gas. 5. Everyone helps each other to prevent bandits and thieves. The conference heard reports from District Head Han Linguang and Director of the Third Branch of the Public Security Bureau respectively to the conference on the implementation of the resolutions of the first session of the People's Representatives Conference of All Circles in the district and the public security work in the past five months.
