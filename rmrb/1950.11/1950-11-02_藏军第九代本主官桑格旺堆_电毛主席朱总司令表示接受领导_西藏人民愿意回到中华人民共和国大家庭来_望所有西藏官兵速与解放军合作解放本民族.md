Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 1st—Sangge Wangdui, the former Ninth Generation 本主 Official of the Tibetan Army, after leading his troops in an uprising, sent a telegram on the 18th to Liu Bocheng, Chairman of the Southwest Military and Political Committee, forwarded to Chairman Mao Zedong of the Central People's Government and Commander-in-Chief Zhu De of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, expressing acceptance of the leadership of the Central People's Government and the People's Liberation Army, and hoping that all Tibetan officers and soldiers would cooperate with the People's Liberation Army as soon as possible, to strive for the liberation of the Tibetan people, the consolidation of national defense in the Southwest, the defense of the motherland, and the defense of world peace. The original telegram from all the officers and soldiers of the Ninth Generation 本主 was in Tibetan, and the translation is as follows: To Chairman Liu of the Southwest Military and Political Committee, forwarded to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu in Beijing:

　　Under the long-term rule and oppression of imperialism and the reactionary authorities, the Tibetan people have suffered deeply and have been unable to free themselves. We have learned from letters from relatives and friends in various places that the purpose of the People's Liberation Army's advance into Tibet this time is to help the Tibetan people liberate themselves from the aggressive forces of imperialism and enable the Tibetan people to return to the big family of the People's Republic of China. It is definitely not like the Manchu Qing government and the Kuomintang reactionaries who wanted to rule Tibet and implement Han chauvinism. Moreover, customs and habits will be handled according to the requirements and needs of the Tibetan people, and there will be a national autonomous government. In the past, we deeply hated the imperialist aggression against Tibet, but the Tibetan people are sparsely populated, culturally backward, and further subjected to imperialist instigation, making us unable to resist their aggressive forces. Now, the Central People's Government and the People's Liberation Army are advancing into Tibet to relieve the suffering of the Tibetan people and drive out the aggressive forces of imperialism. Only the People's Liberation Army, for the liberation of fraternal nationalities, can provide such assistance; others will not. Therefore, we resolutely broke away from the reactionary camp and returned to our own big family, joining hands with the People's Liberation Army to fight for the liberation of the Tibetan people. At present, we hope even more that all Tibetan officers and soldiers will cooperate with the People's Liberation Army as soon as possible to strive for the liberation of our nation, the consolidation of national defense in the Southwest, the defense of the motherland, and the defense of world peace, and that they must not go astray. Now, what I have seen of the discipline and policies of the People's Liberation Army is the same as what I have heard in the past. I am extremely happy in my heart, and I feel that the road we are taking is the only and most correct road. I also hope that under the leadership of the various leaders, we will strive to learn new knowledge and fight for the cause of the people.

　　藏军第九代本主官桑格旺堆
    电毛主席朱总司令表示接受领导
    西藏人民愿意回到中华人民共和国大家庭来
    望所有西藏官兵速与解放军合作解放本民族
    【新华社重庆一日电】原西藏军第九代本主官桑格旺堆率部起义后，于十八日致电西南军政委员会刘伯承主席转中央人民政府毛泽东主席、中国人民解放军朱德总司令，表示接受中央人民政府和人民解放军的领导，并希望所有西藏官兵从速与人民解放军合作，为藏族解放，及巩固西南国防，保卫祖国，保卫世界和平而奋斗。第九代本全体官兵原电系藏文，翻译如下：西南军政委员会刘主席转北京中央人民政府毛主席、朱总司令：
    西藏人民在帝国主义及反动当局的长期统治压迫下，深受痛苦，无法解脱。解放军这次进军西藏的目的，已由各地亲友来信知悉，是为了帮助西藏人民从帝国主义侵略势力下解放出来，使西藏人民回到中华人民共和国的大家庭来，决不像满清政府和国民党反动派那样想统治西藏，实行大汉族主义；并且风俗习惯等均依西藏人民的要求和需要办理，有民族自治政府。以前我们对于帝国主义侵略西藏深以为恨，但我西藏人民地广人稀，文化落后，又加以帝国主义的挑拨离间，无力反抗其侵略势力。现中央人民政府、人民解放军为解除西藏人民痛苦，驱逐帝国主义的侵略势力，而进军西藏。这只有人民解放军为兄弟民族的解放才有这样的援助，其他是不会的。因此，我们毅然脱离反动阵营，回到自己的大家庭里来，与解放军携手为解放西藏人民而奋斗。目前更希望所有西藏官兵速与解放军合作，为本民族解放及巩固西南国防，保卫祖国，保卫世界和平而奋斗，务盼别走歧途。现在我所见到的解放军的纪律、政策，和已往所听到的一样，内心极高兴，觉得我们走的路是唯一最正确的路。并望在各首长的领导下，努力学习新的知识，为人民事业而奋斗。

          十月十八日于宁静
