　　Mexican Communist Party Holds Congress
    US Communist Leader Laurent Arrives and Delivers Speech
    Resolution Passed to Send Greetings to US Communist Party General Secretary Dennis
    [Xinhua News Agency, 28th] Electric News Agency, Mexico City, 24th: The 11th National Congress of the Mexican Communist Party opened here on the 22nd. Representatives from the Communist Parties of the United States, Cuba, and other countries attended. The congress heard and discussed the report of the General Secretary of the Mexican Communist Party, Encina. American Communist leader Laurent delivered a speech at the meeting on the 23rd, pointing out that American imperialism's war plans and anti-democratic suppression are facing increasing resistance from the American people. He extended fraternal greetings to the congress on behalf of the American Communist Party.

    In his speech, Laurent pointed out: The United States today exhibits many characteristics of a police state, with increasing attacks on advocates of peace and conspiracies to declare the Communist Party illegal. However, he said: Despite the fact that the heads of right-wing unions support the government's guns-before-butter policy, the strike movement demanding wage increases is growing.

    Laurent discussed in detail the domestic attacks in the United States on Black people (he cited the case of twenty-eight Black people being sentenced to death on fabricated charges) and on ethnic minority groups, particularly on the five million Mexicans and Mexican descendants in the northwestern United States and on the enslaved Puerto Ricans. He emphasized that struggles against American imperialism have been launched among all these ethnic groups, and that the Communist Party stands at the forefront of the struggle against war, against fascism, and for the liberation of oppressed nations.

    Laurent's speech concluded with everyone rising to cheer him. The congress subsequently passed a telegram of warm greetings to American Communist Party General Secretary Dennis, who is currently imprisoned after being sentenced to one year in prison for "contempt" of the fascist House Un-American Activities Committee.

    The congress sent a telegram in support of the 7,000 miners in Coahuila, who have been heroically striking for several weeks against companies controlled by American capital.

　　墨共举行代表大会
    美共领袖劳伦士到会并发表演说      
    通过向美共总书记但尼斯致敬电
    【新华社二十八日讯】电通社墨西哥城二十四日讯：墨西哥共产党第十一届全国代表大会于二十二日起在此间举行。到会的有美国、古巴等其他国家共产党代表。大会听取并讨论了墨共总书记恩西那的报告。美国共产党领袖劳伦士二十三日在会上发表演说，指出美帝国主义的战争计划和反民主的镇压，正遭到美国人民日益增涨的抵抗。他代表美共向大会致兄弟的敬礼。
    劳伦士在演说中指出：美国今天表现了许多警察国家的特点，对和平拥护者的进攻和宣布共产党为非法的阴谋日见加紧。但是他说：尽管右翼工会的头子们支持政府的大炮代替牛油的政策，要求增加工资的罢工运动正在增涨中。
    劳伦士详尽地讨论了美国国内对黑人的进攻（他举出有二十八名黑人在捏造的罪状下被判死刑）以及对少数民族集团，特别是对美国西北部五百万墨西哥人与墨西哥人后裔和对被奴役的波多黎各人的进攻。他着重指出一切这些民族间都掀起了反对美帝国主义的斗争，而共产党则站在反对战争、反对法西斯主义和争取被压迫民族解放的斗争的最前线。
    劳伦士演说结束时，大家起来对他欢呼。大会随后通过向美共总书记但尼斯热烈致敬的电报，但尼斯因“蔑视”法西斯的非美活动委员会而被判一年徒刑，现正在监禁中。
    大会通电声援科阿韦拉州的七千矿工，他们为反对被美国资本所控制的公司，已英勇地罢工了好几个星期。
