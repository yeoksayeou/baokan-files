　　At a time when the fascist ringleader, the United States, is igniting the flames of war in Korea and other regions of the Far East, and is attempting to expand the war, threatening the peace of all mankind, I think it is meaningful to recommend the book "I Want to Know About Atomic Issues" to readers.
　　This is a special issue published by the organ of the World Peace Congress Committee, the bi-monthly "Defenders of Peace." The authors, including Joliot-Curie, are all authorities on atomic energy research in the world, and also heroic peace fighters. The book is divided into eight chapters, with a preface by Guo Moruo. Although the book is only 50,000 words in length, it provides concise and insightful explanations of various issues related to atomic energy—it first tells us about the history of atomic energy research and the principles of atomic energy, the application of atomic energy in medicine and industry, and then discusses the process of atomic bomb manufacturing and deployment, the evolution of the issue of banning and managing atomic weapons, the opinions of international scientific and religious authorities on atomic weapons, and the analysis of atomic warfare, etc., and finally talks about the Stockholm Appeal.
　　This book gives us rich knowledge and helps us to deeply understand the international situation. I gained the following understanding and feelings from reading this book.
　　In June 1945, when Germany had already been defeated and Japan was on the verge of collapse, the Scientists' Committee chaired by Professor James Franck of the United States, submitted a report on the "Social and Political Consequences of Using Atomic Weapons" to the US Department of Defense, which stated: "...If the United States first throws this new weapon of mass destruction at mankind, it will be abandoned by world public opinion, it will cause an arms race among countries around the world, and it will make it difficult to achieve international agreements to control this weapon in the future." Therefore, the committee believed that "the use of the atomic bomb to attack Japan should be discouraged" (this document was not published until a year later). In August 1945, the Soviet army in the Far East had already posed a serious threat to Japan. The Soviet Union, in accordance with the decision of the Yalta Conference, was about to begin attacking Japan on August 8. It was at that time that the petty man Truman "decided to go ahead of the Soviet army and use the atomic bomb at all costs." Originally, what he "was concerned about was mainly the victory gained by the Soviet Union in the anti-fascist war, and he attempted to use atomic threats to control the world." "On August 6, ... the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, Japan (160,000 victims); on August 9, the second atomic bomb fell on Nagasaki (70,000 victims). But these two cities were not important military targets!" Why did the United States do this? The US Strategic Bombing Report stated: "Hiroshima and Nagasaki were chosen as targets because of the concentrated activities and dense population of the residents of these two cities." Professor Blackett, a great British physicist, pointed out: "Indeed, we can draw such a conclusion that the dropping of the atomic bomb was not so much the last military action of World War II as the first important action of the 'Cold War.'" From these facts, we can clearly see the seriousness of the crimes committed by the brutal American imperialists, just as Guo Moruo said in the preface to this book, "The crimes committed by a mediocre and incompetent fellow like Truman are in fact greater than those of Hitler and Mussolini!"
　　Secondly, regarding the issue of international management of atomic energy, the book describes the evolution of this issue over the past four or five years. The socialist Soviet Union has always stood on the position of safeguarding world peace, advocating the establishment of an atomic control system, and expressing its willingness to submit to control and supervision. In fact, in November 1947, Molotov declared that the secret of the atomic bomb had long ceased to exist; in 1948, "the Soviet Union further insisted in the United Nations on the establishment of an agreement, proposing that the destruction and control of the atomic bomb be implemented simultaneously." The Soviet Union "also proposed reducing all weapons by one-third. The majority in the United Nations rejected these proposals, and the US government even declared this a terrible 'peace offensive.'" On September 24, 1949, Truman announced "the fact that there was an atomic explosion in the Soviet Union." Vishinsky affirmed this news at the United Nations conference, saying: "We use atomic energy to level mountains, irrigate desert fields, and reclaim forest areas." At the same time, he re-proposed "the Soviet Union's proposal on the destruction of the atomic bomb and the simultaneous establishment of control." The era of the United States treating atomic energy as a patent has actually come to an end, "This is a time that is conducive to negotiation. The balance of atomic energy has been achieved, and it is possible to negotiate on an equal footing. The US government is under great pressure and has to re-examine this situation." "However, the US government did not adopt the ban on atomic weapons, but instead promoted the hydrogen bomb and exaggerated the power of the hydrogen bomb."
　　The propaganda of the hydrogen bomb aroused angry reactions around the world. Authorities and scientific organizations in the scientific community of the United States and Britain, Protestantism, French Catholicism, American churches, the International Red Cross and other groups and leaders, unanimously filed accusations against the United States, opposed the use of atomic bombs, and expressed their desire for peaceful coexistence among mankind. This is indeed an "awakening of consciousness!"
　　The above shows who is the defender of peace and who is the instigator of war between the two major camps in the world today. And all the people of the world, except for fascists, are defenders of peace. If the fascist ringleader, the United States, wants to provoke a world war today, it will inevitably be resisted by the people of the world. In the end, the fascists themselves will inevitably follow the old path of Hitler and Mussolini, which is beyond doubt.
　　Although the atomic bomb has a high degree of destructive power, enough to destroy a large number of lives, can it really determine victory or defeat in war? Chapter 6 of this book makes a multi-faceted, concrete, and precise analysis of the performance of atomic weapons. The conclusion reached is: "Atomic weapons cannot enable a belligerent country to win in war. Atomic weapons are only a powerful supplementary weapon. Infantry is still necessary, and the infantry can still advance rapidly." "The Atlantic Treaty was established precisely to supply this absolutely indispensable purpose." The American imperialist commentator Lippmann said nakedly in his recent book "The Cold War": "It is extremely obvious that Western European countries will provide a large amount of manpower, and the United States will supply munitions." In 1945, some people still did not understand that Japan's surrender was the result of the two atomic bombs dropped by the United States. However, Chennault, an American war profiteer who commanded the Kuomintang Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang at the time, declared to the New York Times on August 15 of that year: "The Soviet Union's participation in the war against Japan was a decisive factor in speeding up the end of the war; even if the atomic bomb had not been dropped, the result would have been the same."
　　Even though atomic weapons cannot determine the outcome of war, the American fascist ringleader is still holding it hostage to threaten world peace, vainly attempting to provoke a major war in order to carry out its evil plan to enslave the world. "Indeed, 1950 is a year that makes people feel deeply threatened." In order to oppose the aggressive ambitions of American fascists, the International Peace Congress issued an urgent and moving appeal from Stockholm on March 10 this year for the unconditional banning of atomic bombs, calling on all good people in the world to sign this declaration. Since the issuance of this appeal, nearly 500 million people around the world have signed it to date. In the Soviet Union, all 115 million citizens have signed it. In our China, more than 200 million people have signed it. In Japan, 3 million people have signed it, and in the United States, 2.5 million people have signed it. The movement is still in full swing. "If all mankind, in all regions, continue to work unreservedly and unyieldingly, then peace can be maintained and guaranteed. However, the maintenance and guarantee of this peace does not rely on a fragile balance of power but on the increased vigilance of all people!"
　　The Chinese people have always loved peace. Today, the American fascist ringleader is carrying out a war of aggression in Korea, which has threatened the sacred territory of our Northeast. At the same time, it has actually occupied our Taiwan. On the one hand, we must continue to expand the signature movement, and at the same time, we must raise our vigilance to the extreme. If the enemy dares to continue to expand the war of aggression, we must not stand idly by, but should make effective resistance. Premier Zhou said, "We Chinese people love peace, but in order to defend peace, we have never been and will never be afraid to resist wars of aggression." Yes, the Chinese people who have stood up are definitely not afraid to resist wars of aggression!

　　读《我要知道原子问题》
    逸君
    原编者：世界和平大会委员会机关刊《保卫和平者》
    编译者：中国保卫世界和平大会委员会
    出版者：世界知识社（一九五○年十月初版）
    正当法西斯头子美国在朝鲜及远东其他地区燃烧起战争的火焰，并企图扩大战争，威胁到全人类的和平的今天，把《我要知道原子问题》这册书推荐给读者，我想是有意义的。
    这是世界保卫和平大会委员会机关刊《保卫和平者》半月刊出版的一册专号。执笔者约里奥·居里等，他们都是世界原子能研究的权威，同时也都是英勇的和平战士。全书共分八章，卷首有郭沫若的序文。全书虽然只有五万字的篇幅，可是有关原子能的各项问题，都给作了扼要透辟的说明了——它首先告诉我们原子能研究的历史和原子能的原理，原子能在医药上、工业上的应用，以下分别讲到原子弹制造和施用的经过，原子武器禁止和管理的问题的演变，国际科学界、宗教界权威人士对原子武器的意见和原子战争的剖析等等，最后讲到了斯德哥尔摩宣言。
    这本书给与我们丰富的知识，帮助我们深刻地了解国际的现势。我读了这本书获得了如下的认识和感想。
    当一九四五年六月，德国已经战败，日本正要崩溃的时候，美国詹姆士·佛兰克教授任主席的科学家委员会，曾做了个关于“使用原子武器的社会的及政治的后果”的报告送给美国国防部，其中说：“……假如美国首先向人类投掷这大规模毁灭的新武器，它便要被全世界的公共舆论所遗弃，就要引起全世界各国的军备竞争，就要使将来管制这种武器的国际协定难以实现。”所以委员会认为“使用原子弹攻击日本一事应予以劝阻”（这文件到一年后才被公布出来）。一九四五年八月苏联的军队在远东已经给予日本以严重威胁。苏联遵守雅尔达会议的决定，即将于八月八日开始攻击日本。就在那时候，小人物杜鲁门“便决定要走在苏军的前面，不顾一切地使用原子弹了。”原来他“所关心的主要是苏联在反法西斯战争中所获得的胜利，并且企图用原子的威胁来控制世界。”“八月六日的那天，……原子弹投落在日本的广岛（十六万牺牲者）；八月九日第二枚原子弹降落在长崎（七万牺牲者）。但这两个城市并不是重要的军事目标！”美国为什么要这样做呢？美国关于战略轰炸报告中说：“广岛及长崎被选作投弹目标乃由于这两个城市的居民活动集中和人口稠密的原因。”英国大物理学家勃兰凯教授指出：“真的，我们可以得着这样一个结论，原子弹的投掷，与其说是第二次世界大战最后的一个军事行动，不如说是‘冷战’开始的第一个重要行动。”从这些事实中，使我们很清楚的看到残暴的美帝国主义者所犯的罪行的重大，正如郭沫若在本书序文中所说的那样，“像杜鲁门这样庸懦无能的家伙，所犯的罪，事实上比希特勒、墨索里尼还要大！”
    其次，关于原子能国际管理问题，书中叙述了四、五年来这问题演变的经过。社会主义的苏联，始终如一地站在维护世界和平的立场，主张建立原子管制的制度，表示愿意服从管制和监视。事实上，在一九四七年十一月，莫洛托夫就宣称原子弹的秘密早就不存在了；一九四八年“苏联在联合国更坚持希望成立协定，提议原子弹的销毁和管制的设立同时实行。”苏联“还提出将所有武器减除三分之一。联合国中的大多数拒绝了这些建议，美国政府并且宣称这是可怕的‘和平攻击’。”一九四九年九月二十四日，杜鲁门宣布“在苏联有原子爆炸的事实发生”，维辛斯基在联合国会议席上肯定了这个消息，说：“我们利用原子能铲平山岳，灌溉沙漠田野，开垦森林区。”他同时重新提出了“苏联的关于原子弹的销毁和同时建立管制的建议。”美国把原子能当作专利的时代实际已告终结了，“这个时候是有利于协商的了，原子能的平衡均势已经有了，站在平等地位商谈是可能了。美国政府受到了一种重大的压力，不得不对于这个形势加以重新检讨。”“然而美国政府并不采取禁用原子武器，反而宣传氢气弹了，夸张氢气弹的威力。”
    氢气弹的宣传激起了全世界的愤怒的反响。美国的、英国的科学界权威人士，和科学团体，基督教新教、法国天主教、美国的教会、国际红十字会等团体和领袖，一致对美国提出了控诉，反对使用原子弹，表示人类和平相处的愿望。这确是人类“意识的觉醒！”
    以上说明了今天世界两大阵营之间，究竟谁是和平的保卫者，谁是战争的挑拨者。而全世界人民除了法西斯主义者以外都是和平的保卫者，在今天如果法西斯头子美国要挑起世界大战，必然要受全世界人民的反抗，最后法西斯主义者自身必然要走上希特勒和墨索里尼的老路，那是无可置疑的。
    原子弹虽然具有高度的破坏力，足以大量毁灭生命，它在战争中究竟能不能决定胜负呢？本书第六章把原子武器的性能，作了多方面的具体的精密的剖析，所得的结论是：“原子武器并不能使一个交战国在战争中获得胜利，原子武器不过是有一种有力的补充武器而已。步兵仍然是必需的，而且步兵队伍还能迅速前进。”“大西洋公约也正是为了供给这个绝对不可缺乏的目的而成立的。”美帝论客李普曼在他的近著《冷战》一书里赤裸裸地说道：“那是极显明的，西欧国家将大量的供给人力，美国则供给军火。”一九四五年日本的投降，还有一些不明白的人以为是美国投下的两颗原子弹所获致的效果。可是当时指挥着国民党蒋介石匪帮的美国战贩陈纳德却曾于那年八月十五日向纽约时报宣称：“苏联参加对日战争，是使战争加快结束的具有决定性的因素；即使原子弹没有投掷，结果仍是一样。”
    尽管原子武器并不能决定战争的胜负，美国法西斯头子却还是挟持着它来威胁全世界的和平，妄图挑起大战，以遂行其奴辱世界人类的罪恶。“的确不错，一九五○年是令人深深感觉到威胁的一年。”为了反对美国法西斯的这种侵略野心，本年三月十日，国际和平大会，从斯德哥尔摩发出了迫切动人的无条件禁用原子弹的号召，号召全世界一切良善的人们，在这个宣言上签字。这个号召发出以后到最近为止全世界签字的已经有近五亿的人民。在苏联，全体公民一亿一千五百万人都签了字，在我们中国签名的人民已经超过两亿，日本已经有三百万人签字，美国签名的也有二百五十万人，运动还在热烈展开中。“假如所有人类，在所有地区全都不加保留地、不屈不挠地继续努力，那么和平便可以维持，可以得到保障。然而这和平的维持和保障，不是依靠一种脆弱的势力的平衡而是由于所有人民警惕性的提高！”
    我们中国人民向来是热爱和平的。今天法西斯头子的美国在朝鲜进行侵略战争已经威胁到我们的东北的神圣的领土，同时事实上已经侵占了我们的台湾，我们一方面要继续扩大签名运动，同时更要把我们的警惕性提高到极度，敌人如果敢于继续扩展侵略战争，我们决不能置之不理，而应作有效的抵抗。周总理说，“我们中国人民热爱和平，但是为了保卫和平，从不也永不害怕反抗侵略战争。”是的，已经站起来了的中国人民是决不害怕反抗侵略的战争的！
