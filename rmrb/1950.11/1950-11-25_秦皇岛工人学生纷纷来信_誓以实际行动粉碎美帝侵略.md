　　Qinhuangdao Workers and Students Write Letters Expressing Determination to Crush American Imperialist Aggression with Practical Actions

　　[Our Newspaper] The workers and students of Qinhuangdao City are extremely angry about the expansion of American imperialist aggression in Korea and the invasion of our country's territory, airspace, and territorial waters. They have been writing to this newspaper to express their determination to resist America, aid Korea, protect their homes, and defend the country.

　　One hundred and twenty-six model workers at the Qinhuangdao city level said: "For our solemn and beautiful motherland, for our happy and free lives, for lasting world peace, and for our Korean brothers, we vow: We will resolutely use practical actions, work hard in production, unite the masses, and strike at American imperialism. Once the motherland needs us, we will not hesitate to dedicate everything we have!"

　　Fifty-seven workers (railway repair workers) including Zheng Haishan of Kailuan Daobo, Qinhuangdao, swore in a letter: "All of us at Daobo will use practical actions and work hard in production to express our anger at American imperialism and to show our determination to aid Korea and defend our country. Hammers, picks, and milling machines are not only our production tools but also our fighting weapons. We will not only use them to ensure 'the safe entry and exit of coal trucks without accidents,' but when necessary, we will also use hammers, picks, and milling machines to beat the American imperialists to death."

　　Dong Ruiting, a coal lifting worker and special-class model worker at the Kailuan Coal Mine, wrote: "Only by taking practical actions can we tear this paper tiger apart and kick it out of Asia. I am willing to dedicate everything I have to the motherland to protect the fruits of victory that the revolutionary martyrs exchanged for their heads and hot blood, and to crush American imperialist aggression."

　　Zhao Liantian, a model worker in Qinhuangdao, wrote: "We guarantee safe power transmission, overfulfill our tasks, and use the elimination of responsibility accidents to strike at American imperialism."

　　Li Cunshu, a labor model at Qinhuangdao Station, wrote: "History teaches us that the only way to effectively stop wars of aggression when dealing with imperialism is to use revolutionary force to thoroughly strike it down. In addition to working harder and striving to complete my tasks ahead of schedule, I am willing to sacrifice all personal interests, respond to the call of my superiors, and strike at American imperialism."

　　The students of Qinhuangdao Municipal No. 1 Middle School have been holding current affairs discussions during extracurricular activities for several days. Many students, filled with enthusiasm, volunteer to go to Korea to fight in the war, protect their homes, and defend their country, and use practical actions to support the Korean people. Student Li Xiulan said: "I used to have family concerns, but the bloody aggression of American imperialism has educated me. Now I only have hatred for American imperialism!" Li Shumin, a second-year student, said: "If our neighbor's sheep are eaten by wolves and we don't care, our own sheep will be eaten too! We must not wait for the wolves to come in. I am willing to shed the last drop of my blood to liberate the Korean people and crush American imperialist aggression!"
