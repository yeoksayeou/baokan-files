　　——Remembering the Heroic Deeds of Korean Comrades in the Northeast Anti-Japanese War
    Our reporters Chao Qi and Lin Hong

    "The Korean people sacrificed their lives and shed their blood, standing with the Chinese people to fight against the reactionary forces of imperialism and feudalism. The Chinese people will forever remember their chivalrous acts." - Statement by the Foreign Ministry Spokesperson on September 23rd.

    On February 19, 1946, a grand ceremony was held in Tonghua City, Liaodong Province, for the establishment of the Yang Jingyu Detachment and the Li Hongguang Detachment. Yang Jingyu was the commander of the First Army of the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army, and Korean comrade Li Hongguang was the chief of staff of that army. They were outstanding sons of the Chinese and Korean people who heroically sacrificed themselves in the Northeast during the Anti-Japanese War. To commemorate these two people's fighters, the Chinese people specially named two heroic and skilled troops after them.
            (I) The Chinese and Korean People Are Bound by Flesh and Blood

    China and Korea are countries as closely related as lips and teeth. After the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895, Korea became a Japanese colony, and many Korean revolutionary patriots fled to China and joined the Chinese people in resisting imperialist aggression.

    Especially after the "September 18th Incident" (Mukden Incident) when the Northeast was lost, the Chinese and Korean people launched a vigorous anti-Japanese guerrilla war in various parts of the Northeast shoulder to shoulder. In 1931, there was the incident of Korean patriots attacking the Japanese Consulate in Harbin, the Great Riot in Jiandao, and the Great Riot along the Jidun Railway. These spontaneous anti-Japanese movements of the Chinese and Korean people gradually formed organized anti-Japanese armed forces under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. In 1935, the famous Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army was established, possessing more than 200,000 people and various light and heavy weapons. At that time, the famous Panshi Guerrilla Force was the predecessor of the First Army of the Anti-Japanese United Army; the East Manchuria Guerrilla Force was the predecessor of the Second Army; the Zhuhe Guerrilla Force was the predecessor of the Third Army; the Ning'an Guerrilla Force was the predecessor of the Fifth Army; the Tangyuan Guerrilla Force was the predecessor of the Sixth Army; and the Raohe Guerrilla Force was the predecessor of the Seventh Army. These troops included a large number of Korean comrades, many of whom held important leadership positions. The Panshi Guerrilla Force was formed in 1932 during the anti-Japanese riot of the Chinese and Korean people in the Hamahezi area. Its organizer and leader was Li Hongguang, a CCP member and an outstanding Korean people's fighter. Li Hongguang later served as the chief of staff of the First Army of the Anti-Japanese United Army and gloriously sacrificed himself after many bloody battles with the Japanese and puppet troops. The Korean national leader General Kim Il-sung once served as the commander of a division of the First Army of the Anti-Japanese United Army. The East Manchuria Guerrilla Force was composed of the Yanji, Wangqing, Helong, and Huichun guerrilla forces. Since foreign residents accounted for the majority in this area, most of the Second Army of the Anti-Japanese United Army were Korean comrades. Kim Chaek was the director of the Political Department of the Third Army of the Anti-Japanese United Army led by General Zhao Shangzhi, and Li Fulin was the commander of the First Division. Ma Deyi, the commander of the First Division of the Sixth Army of the Anti-Japanese United Army, and Xu Guanghai, the director of the Political Department of that division, were both outstanding leaders of the Korean people who gloriously sacrificed themselves in the fourteen-year anti-Japanese guerrilla war in the Northeast.
            (II) Moving and Tragic Deeds

    During the period of the Japanese occupation of the Northeast, the patriotic Korean volunteers always stood with the people of the Northeast, crossing mountains and ridges, climbing on ice and lying in snow, and carrying out tenacious and unyielding struggles against the Japanese invaders. On Changbai Mountain, along the Yalu River, and in the sparsely populated Greater and Lesser Khingan Mountains, the bright red flag of anti-Japanese resistance could be seen everywhere, and the majestic sound of the march could be heard. The Chinese and Korean people fought heroically, repeatedly inflicting severe blows on the Japanese invaders, but also paid a heavy price themselves. The moving and tragic heroic deeds of many Korean comrades are still circulating in various parts of the Northeast. In 1937, General Li Fulin personally led the Young Pioneers to operate in the Yilan area along the Songhua River and was surrounded by enemies several times his number. General Li Fulin was seriously injured. The guard wanted to carry him out. Knowing that his injuries were too serious to break through, he took out party documents from his body and handed them to the orderly, saying firmly: "You break through with the documents and hand them over to the military headquarters." He stayed where he was and fought the enemy, heroically committing suicide with his last bullet. Li Genzhi, 15 years old, was a member of the Communist Youth League and the captain of the Young Pioneers under the leadership of General Zhao Shangzhi. In battle, he often led the Young Pioneers to undertake assault missions. When camping, he always settled his brothers like an older brother before going to sleep himself. Later, he became the captain of the cavalry. In the battle to attack the Tianjia Oil Mill in Sanchahe, Bin County in the spring of 1934, he was unfortunately surrounded by the enemy. Li Genzhi led the cavalry to make a heroic breakthrough, killing nineteen enemies in a row, and the enemies retreated in panic. Li Genzhi sacrificed himself in the charge. General Zhao Shangzhi personally wrote a poem to mourn this outstanding son of the Korean people.

    Korean women residing in the Northeast also bravely participated in the Anti-Japanese Guerrilla Force. Jin Bowen, the wife of the famous anti-Japanese national hero General Li Zhaolin, was one of them. Jin Bowen's father was killed by the Japanese invaders for engaging in the Korean independence movement. Her brother joined the Chinese Communist Party in 1928 and actively engaged in anti-Japanese work, but was assassinated by a traitor after the "September 18th Incident." This girl, who had been educated in revolutionary thought since she was a child and was filled with hatred for the Japanese invaders, left her hometown of Wangqing at the age of thirteen (1932) and joined the ranks of the Anti-Japanese United Army. She marched and fought like her male comrades, and when the comrades were resting, she cooked for them or sewed clothes for them. Jin Bowen was a famous strong woman, and she always took the lead when carrying grain. Setting off from the mountains early in the morning, she would buy grain in Dajie (an enemy stronghold) when it got dark and quickly carry it back. The round trip was at least two hundred miles. For female comrades, the most difficult thing was giving birth during battle. Jin Bowen's first child was born during the most difficult time for the Anti-Japanese United Army. On the day she gave birth, she was transferred to three places because of the enemy's pursuit. The child was born on the snow, immediately wrapped in a piece of sackcloth, and the adults and children were transferred with the team again.

    There is also a particularly moving story. In the Children's Corps of Jiandao, Jilin, there was a Korean girl who was good at singing and dancing. Her parents, brothers, and sisters were all brutally killed by the Japanese invaders. People did not know her name and called her Little Girl. Under the leadership of the Children's Corps, she sang and danced everywhere to promote anti-Japanese resistance to the people. In 1934, she went to Ning'an with the Jiandao People's慰问队 to perform for the guerrilla隊. Not long after returning to Jiandao, she was captured by the Japanese running dog "Korean Self-Defense Force." The enemy tried every means to coax her to tell the situation of the guerrilla隊 and threatened her, saying: "If you don't surrender, we will kill you." The little girl calmly replied: "You and I are enemies. If I catch you, I will kill you too; now that I have fallen into your hands, kill me quickly!" This little girl, who was only eight years old, sacrificed heroically while shouting slogans such as "Long live the independence of the Chinese and Korean nations" and "Down with the Japanese robbers!"
            (III) Joining the Army and Participating in the War to Defend Our Homes

    After the "August 15th" surrender of the Japanese invaders, many Korean comrades returned to their homeland after many years of separation. The Korean people who remained in the Northeast began to enter a thriving life. Like the Chinese people, they were allotted land, and under the leadership of the people's government, they reclaimed wasteland, cultivated land carefully, and their lives became increasingly prosperous. Soon, Chiang Kai-shek launched a counter-revolutionary civil war with the support of American imperialism, and his guns were first aimed at the Northeast. The Korean people who remained in the Northeast, together with the Chinese people, put on their military uniforms again, stepped onto the battlefield, and fought to defend their homes. In Bayan County, Songjiang Province, a village of about 200 Korean residents had 180 people volunteering for the army. Jin Zixiang, a Korean farmer in Hailan Village in his fifties, sent his three sons and two younger brothers to the front line at the most critical time of the war. During the more than four years of the People's Liberation War, there were a large number of Korean comrades on the battlefield and in the rear field hospitals. In the famous Gongzhutun battle in 1947, a certain army was ordered to block the three divisions of the Chiang army reinforcing from Shenyang, and fought bloody battles in the Erlong Mountain area for three days and three nights. A certain regiment of that army was entirely Korean, and they repeatedly charged and killed the enemy, recapturing the lost mountain positions, and were praised by the division headquarters. Korean comrade Jiang Jian served as the commander of the Jidong Military Region after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War. In the first battle of Changchun, he led a division of Korean soldiers as the main attacking force. In this battle, the regimental commander of a certain regiment of that division, Park Luoquan, gloriously martyred.

    For more than ten years, the blood of Korean revolutionary volunteers has been shed all over the land of China. The great Chinese and Korean nations have forged an unbreakable fighting friendship in the crucible of history. Today, when our Korean comrades are being frantically invaded by American imperialism and when our motherland is under serious threat, we cherish the friendship between the Chinese and Korean peoples that has been forged in years of fighting side by side, and we should unite and rise up to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend our country.

　　中朝人民的革命友情
　　——记朝鲜同志在东北抗日战争中的英勇事迹
    本报记者　超祺　林洪
    “朝鲜人民牺牲他们的生命，流了他们的鲜血，站在中国人民一起，为打倒帝国主义和封建主义的反动势力而斗争，中国人民对他们这种侠义行为，永远感念不忘。”——九月二十三日外交部发言人声明
    一九四六年二月十九日，辽东省通化市隆重地举行了杨靖宇支队和李红光支队的成立典礼。杨靖宇是东北抗日民主联军第一军军长，朝鲜同志李红光是该军的参谋长。他们是抗日战争时期在东北英勇牺牲的中朝人民的优秀儿子。中国人民为了纪念这两个人民战士，特地把两支英勇善战的队伍，冠上他们的名字。
            （一）中朝人民血肉相连
    中国与朝鲜，是唇齿相依的国家。甲午战后，朝鲜变成日本的殖民地，许多朝鲜革命志士流亡中国，和中国人民一起，反抗帝国主义的侵略。
    特别是“九一八”东北沦亡以后，中朝人民并肩在东北各地掀起如火如荼的抗日游击战争。一九三一年发生了朝鲜志士袭击哈尔滨日本领事馆事件和间岛大暴动与吉敦铁路沿线大暴动。这些自发的中朝人民的抗日运动，在中国共产党领导下，逐渐形成有组织的抗日武装。一九三五年，有名的东北抗日民主联军成立，拥有二十余万人和各种轻重武器。当时著名的磐石游击队，是抗联第一军的前身；东满游击队是第二军的前身；珠河游击队是第三军的前身；宁安游击队是第五军的前身；汤原游击队是第六军的前身；饶河游击队是第七军的前身。这些队伍中有大批的朝鲜同志，其中许多人担负着重要的领导工作。磐石游击队是一九三二年中朝人民在哈马河子一带反日大暴动中产生的，它的组织者和领导者是中共党员、优秀的朝鲜人民战士李红光。李红光以后曾任抗联第一军参谋长，与日伪军多次血战后光荣牺牲。朝鲜民族领袖金日成将军，曾任抗联第一军某师师长。东满游击队是延吉、汪清、和龙、晖春四个游击队组成的。这一带外国居民占多数，所以抗联第二军大部是朝鲜同志。金策是赵尚志将军领导的抗联第三军的政治部主任，李福林是第一师师长。抗联第六军第一师师长马德一，该师政治部主任徐光海，都是优秀的朝鲜人民的领导者，在东北十四年的抗日游击战争中光荣牺牲。
            （二）可歌可泣的悲壮事迹
    在日寇侵占东北时期，朝鲜的爱国志士始终和东北人民站在一起，翻山越岭，爬冰卧雪，和日寇进行顽强不屈的斗争。在长白山上，鸭绿江畔和人烟稀少的大小兴安岭上，随处可以看到抗日的鲜红旗帜，听见雄壮的进军号声。中朝人民英勇战斗，屡次给予日寇严重的打击，自己也付出了惨重的代价。许多朝鲜同志的可歌可泣的英雄事迹，至今仍然流传在东北各地。一九三七年，李福林将军亲自率领少年先锋队在松花江沿岸依兰地区活动，被数倍于己的敌人包围，李福林将军受了重伤。警卫员想把他背出来。他知道自己伤势太重，无法突围，于是从身上拿出党的文件，交给勤务员，坚定地说：“你带着文件突围，把它交给军部。”他留在原地和敌人作战，以最后一颗子弹，英勇地自杀了。十五岁的李根芝是共产主义青年团团员，是赵尚志将军领导下的少年先锋队队长。在战斗中，他常常带领少先队担任突击任务。宿营时，他总像哥哥一样地把兄弟们安置好了，自己才去睡觉。后来他担任骑兵队队长。一九三四年春攻打宾县三岔河田家油坊之役，不幸被敌包围。李根芝率骑兵队英勇突击，一连打死十九个敌人，敌人惊惶后退。李根芝则在冲锋中牺牲了。赵尚志将军亲自作了一首诗，悼念这位朝鲜人民的优秀儿子。
    侨居东北的朝鲜妇女，也勇敢地参加了抗日游击队。著名抗日民族英雄李兆麟将军的爱人金伯文，便是其中的一个。金伯文的父亲因从事朝鲜独立运动，被日寇所杀。她的哥哥于一九二八年参加中国共产党，积极从事抗日工作，于“九一八”以后为奸细所暗害。这位从小就受着革命思想教育，对日寇充满了仇恨的姑娘，在十三岁（一九三二）时就离开了家乡——汪清，投入抗日联军的行列。她和男同志一样地行军打仗，在同志们休息的时候，她还给他们做饭或缝补衣服。金伯文是有名的大力士，每次背粮食，她总走在前头。一早从山里出发，天黑了到大界（敌据点）买到粮食，迅速地背回来。往返至少二百多里。对于女同志来说，最困难的是在战斗中生孩子。金伯文的第一个孩子，是在抗联最艰苦的时候生产的。在她分娩的那一天，因为敌人追击，转移了三个地方。孩子在雪地上出生了，立刻用麻布片包起来，大人孩子又随队转移。
    还有一件特别令人感动的事。吉林间岛的儿童团里，有一个善于歌舞的朝鲜女孩子。她的父母兄弟姊妹都被日寇惨杀了，人们不知道她的名字，都叫她为小姑娘。在儿童团的领导下，她到处歌舞，向人民宣传抗日。一九三四年，她随着间岛人民慰问队，去宁安为游击队表演。回到间岛不久，她就被日寇走狗“韩人自卫团”俘掳了。敌人千方百计地哄骗她，说出游击队的情况，并威胁说：“你不投降，就杀死你。”小姑娘从容不迫地答道：“你我是仇敌，抓到了你们，我也要把你们杀死；今天我落到你们的手里，要杀就赶快杀吧！”这个年仅八岁的小姑娘，在高呼“中韩民族独立万岁”“打倒日本强盗”的口号声中，英勇地牺牲了。
            （三）参军参战保卫家园
    “八一五”日寇投降后，许多朝鲜同志返回离别多年的祖国。留居在东北的朝鲜人民，开始进入欣欣向荣的生活。他们和中国人民一样地分得了土地，并在人民政府的领导下，开荒垦地，精耕细作，生活日渐富裕。不久，蒋介石在美帝国主义的支持下发动了反人民的内战，枪口首先对准东北。留居在东北的朝鲜人民，又和中国人民一道，重新穿上军装，走上战场，为保卫自己的家园而战斗。松江省巴彦县一个二百来户的朝鲜居民的村庄，就有一百八十人志愿参军。海兰村五十多岁的朝鲜农民金子乡，在战争最紧急的时候，把三个儿子和两个弟弟都送上前线。在四年多的人民解放战争期间，无论在战场上，后方野战医院里，都有大批的朝鲜同志。一九四七年有名的公主屯战役中，某军奉命阻击自沈阳增援的蒋军三师，在二龙山一带血战三昼夜。该军某团全是朝鲜人，曾与敌人反复冲杀，夺回已失去的山头阵地，得到师部的表扬。朝鲜同志姜健，抗战胜利后任吉东军分区司令员，第一次长春之战，他曾率领一师朝鲜士兵担任主攻。在这次战役中，该师某团团长朴洛权光荣殉职。
    十几年来，朝鲜革命志士的鲜血洒遍了中国的土地。伟大的中朝两大民族，在历史的考炼中，已经结成了牢不可破的战斗的友情。今天，在我们的朝鲜战友遭到美帝疯狂侵略的时候，在我们的祖国受着严重威胁的时候，我们珍贵中朝人民多年并肩战斗的友情，应该一致奋起，抗美援朝，保家卫国。
