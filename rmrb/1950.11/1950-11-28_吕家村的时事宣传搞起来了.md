　　The Propaganda Campaign in Lüjia Village is Getting Off the Ground
　　Yú Hóngbō
　　Good Production, Lax Study

　　Lüjia Village in Dehui County, Jilin Province, is a village with very good production, but study is quite lax. All six village and team cadres participated in production; Gǔ Wànchén also led a mutual aid team of seventeen households. Zhāng Déqín, who harvested five *shi* of grain per three *mu* of land in 1949, harvested twenty-three *shi* of grain this year in his mutual aid team. Gǔ Wànchén himself also bought a horse. But when it comes to study, they just can't get motivated. The entire village has 365 households, more than 2,130 people, but not a single peasants' school or newspaper reading group. None of the seven Party members and twenty-two Youth League members study regularly. The "Rural Branch Work Manual" and various documents printed by the Provincial Party Committee Propaganda Department have been sitting in the drawers of the village government office for more than a month, and no one has looked at them. They believe: "Good leadership in production means food to eat, whether we study or not doesn't matter."

　　Not Studying Really Won't Do

　　But not studying really won't do. Because the cadres don't study, they can't carry out propaganda. The masses' understanding of current events is unclear, leaving room for rumors. Some of the masses believed the rumors and developed ideological concerns: some people slaughtered and ate 130 *jin* "half-fat" pigs; other people believed rumors and developed fear of America. Because the cadres didn't pay attention to study, they couldn't figure out these problems either, and they often couldn't give the masses correct explanations. When the masses raised questions, the cadres were also confused and couldn't explain clearly. Some cadres, when asked by the masses if the rumors were true, didn't explain, but just said: "Making up rumors! Who did you hear that from?" As a result, not only could they not solve the masses' ideological problems, but they also increased the masses' concerns about "getting implicated" and "being punished," and they were afraid to ask about the rumors they heard, which affected the mood for production. Of the village's 219 horses, more than half were often idle, and more than 30 *qing* of millet had not been harvested by November 10th. All fifty-five carts were idle, and even horse owners were uneasy.

　　First Let the Cadres Open Their Minds

　　After the County Party Committee work team arrived in this village, based on the above situation, they first convened a current affairs symposium for Party and Youth League members, and talked about "Comparing Which Camp is Stronger?" so that everyone initially understood the strength of the enemy and ourselves. Then, they conducted education on "Comparing the Present with the Past." Everyone unanimously said: "In the past, when we were laborers for the Japanese devils, we couldn't even eat our fill. When we died, we were thrown into the 'Ten Thousand People Pit' to feed the dogs. Everything had to be rationed." "At that time, the landlords held great power and oppressed us. Poor people didn't even have a horse's leg." Then, some people said: "We defeated even the Japanese devils and landlords, and now almost every family has livestock, houses, and land, and we are in charge. If American imperialism wants to follow the old path of the Japanese devils today, we have the full power to defeat it and live a good life forever." Then, they talked about the atrocities of the American devils in Korea, burning, killing, and looting, and also related them to the crimes committed by the United States in the Kuomintang-controlled areas in the past, such as Americans saying that killing a donkey would be compensated with 150,000 yuan, while killing a Chinese person would only be compensated with 100,000 yuan, treating Chinese people as less than human. These things aroused everyone's hatred for American imperialism. Many people said: "If American imperialism occupies Korea, it will invade China and follow the old path of the Japanese devils. That's a dream. We peasants must not allow it, and we will resolutely fight it!" This way, they guided everyone from "fear" to "hatred," and from hatred they further recognized the truth that "if we don't want to be bullied, we must fight." After everyone recognized the current situation, they discussed one after another: "We've really gained knowledge," "We've really opened our minds," "We've really solved the problem." At this time, someone suggested: It's not enough for just a few of us to know! Based on this situation, the work team helped organize a propaganda committee including Party, government, Youth League, women cadres, and school teachers, with the Youth League secretary and the primary school teacher (school Youth League secretary) serving as the director and deputy director; using the methods of explaining the situation, opening minds, and voluntary participation, they developed fifty-six propaganda team members (mainly students). The propaganda committee summarized the experiences and lessons learned from the past when propaganda work was not carried out, and researched propaganda methods that grouped members according to their specialties, propagated at any time, and did not interfere with production.

　　Four Propaganda Methods

　　Their methods are four: First, they rectified the blackboard newspaper, adopting the method of drawing more and writing less, explaining events by referring to the drawings. In the past, very few people looked at the blackboard newspaper. This time, they carried the blackboard newspaper to Xiaonantuan while beating gongs and drums, and immediately more than 100 people came out and surrounded the blackboard newspaper. The propagandists pointed to the cartoons one by one and explained them, and the listeners all said: "In the past, the blackboard had white lines, and the more we looked, the less we knew. This time, we can understand by watching and listening." Second, rooftop broadcasting groups were established in each village. The propaganda committee provided materials, and every night each village could hear the latest news broadcast by the broadcasters using megaphones. The masses reflected: "In the past, we were like deaf people. Now, sitting in our houses, we know about national and world affairs." This method solved the difficulties of the masses who were busy with production and didn't have time to attend meetings, and who didn't recognize enough characters to read newspapers. Third, the propaganda team used the method of visiting door-to-door, talking about whatever they encountered, and checking the effect and shortcomings of the previous day's propaganda in order to improve future work. Fourth, small-scale discussion meetings were held separately for different groups of people. At the meetings, the method of speaking up if you understand and asking questions if you don't understand was adopted so that the masses could raise any questions they didn't understand and discuss solutions. At the meetings, they could also check and ask the masses' opinions on the propaganda work at any time.

　　Voluntary Action

　　After the masses recognized the situation, they went from fearing America to hating and resenting America, and they all said that they would never believe rumors again. Under the leadership of the Communist Party members, everyone immediately asked to take practical action to resist America, aid Korea, and protect their homes and country, voluntarily providing carts and horses to go to Korea to participate in the war. They all said: "If we want to live a good life forever, we must twist three ropes into one and work hard together in the front and rear." Now, the village has voluntarily organized twenty-seven stretchers and fifty-five carts, and many people have re-fanned the public grain that had already been prepared, and are speeding up the threshing of the fields that have not been finished, ready to participate in the front-line work at any time.

　　The current affairs propaganda work in this village started from the masses' own interests, led by the branch, and used organizational strength, under the form of mobilizing everyone to speak and everyone to act.

　　Editor's note: "The Current Affairs Propaganda in Lüjia Village is Getting Started" reflects a fact, that is, some of our village-level cadres are indeed burying their heads in active production, but are indifferent to major national and world events. It should be said that these cadres are not all-rounders. In the current struggle to resist America, aid Korea, and defend world peace against American aggression, they still cannot shoulder the task of leading the masses to carry out resolute struggles, because they lack "capital" and "cannot carry out propaganda." The key is "not studying." This situation, on a national scale, is certainly not limited to one village, and should attract the attention of all localities, quickly changing this situation so that the movement to resist America, aid Korea, and protect our homes and country can truly be popularized and deepened into the countryside.

　　吕家村的时事宣传搞起来了
    于洪波
    生产好学习松
    吉林省德惠县吕家村，是个生产挺好的村子，但是学习挺松。六名村、屯干部，全部参加了生产，谷万臣还领导了一个十七户的互助组；一九四九年三垧地打五石粮的张德勤，今年就在他的互助组里打了二十三石粮。谷万臣自己也买了一匹马。但是谈到学习，就提不起来了。全村三百六十五户，二千一百三十多口人，一个农民学校和读报组也没有。七名党员、二十二名团员，没有一个经常学习的。省委宣传部印发的“农村支部工作手册”和各种文件，在村政府办公桌的抽匣里放了一个多月，谁也没看。他们认为：“领导好生产就有饭吃，学不学习没啥。”
    不学习真不行
    可是不学习真不行。由于干部不学习，无法进行宣传。群众对时事认识不清楚，给谣言腾出了空子。部分群众听信了谣言，产生了思想顾虑：有的人把一百三十斤的“半膘子”猪杀了吃；还有的群众听信谣言，产生了恐美思想。干部因为不注意学习，对这些问题也弄不清，往往不能给群众正确解释。如群众提出问题来，干部也稀里糊涂说不清，甚至有的干部遇到群众问他谣言是不是真的，他不解释，只是说：“瞎造谣！你听谁说的？”结果不但不能解决群众的思想问题，反倒增加了群众“怕沾包”、“怕扣根”的顾虑，听了谣言也不敢打听，因此影响了生产情绪。全村二百一十九匹马，经常有一半以上闲着，直到十一月十日还有三十多垧地的谷子没打完。五十五辆大车都闲着，有马户也不安心。
    先让干部开脑筋
    县委工作组到了这村以后，根据以上情况，首先召开了党、团员的时事座谈会，讲了一下“比一比那个阵营力量大？”使大家初步认识了敌我力量。然后进行了“看现在比过去”的教育。大家一致说：“过去给小日本鬼子当劳工，连饭都吃不饱，死了就往‘万人坑’里一扔喂狗。什么东西都得配给。”“那时地主掌大权，压迫我们，穷人连条马腿都没有。”接着有的人说：“日本鬼子和地主那么蝎虎也都叫咱们打垮了，现在差不多每家都有匹牲口，有房有地，咱们又说了算，今天美帝国主义要想走日本鬼子的老路，咱们完全有力量打垮它，永远过好日子。”接着，又讲了美国鬼子在朝鲜烧杀抢掠的兽行，并联系讲了过去美帝在国民党统治区里所犯的罪行，例如美国人说杀死一条驴赔十五万块钱，杀死一个中国人只赔十万元，拿中国人不当人。这些事激起了大家对美帝的仇恨心。很多人说：“美帝国主义想占了朝鲜，就侵略中国，走日本鬼子的老路，那是作梦。我们农民决不能让，坚决和它干！”这样引导大家从“怕”到“恨”，由恨更认识到“要想不受欺侮非干不可”的道理。大家认清了时事以后，纷纷议论：“真长见识”，“真开脑筋”，“真解决问题”。这时就有人提出：光咱们这几个人知道了也不行啊！工作组根据这种情况就帮助组织了包括党、政、青年团、妇女干部和学校教员参加的宣传委员会，由团支书和完小教员（学校团支书）担任正副主任；利用讲形势，开脑筋，自愿参加的方式，发展了五十六名宣传队员（主要是学生）。由宣传委员会总结了过去宣传工作没搞起来的经验教训，并研究出了按队员特长分组，随时宣传，不误生产的宣传办法。
    四个宣传办法
    他们的办法有四条：一、首先整顿了黑板报，采取多画少写，照画讲事的办法。过去看黑板报的人很少，这回敲着锣鼓把黑板报抬到小南屯，立刻就出来了一百多人，把黑板报围上了。宣传员指着漫画一个一个的讲，听的人都说：“过去是黑板画白道，越看越发不知道，这回连看带听可明白了。”二、各屯建立了屋顶广播小组，由宣传委员会供给材料，每天晚上各屯都可以及时听到广播员用喊话筒广播的新消息，群众反映：“过去好像个聋子，现在坐在屋里就知道国家大事和天下大事了。”这个办法解决了群众生产忙没有工夫开会，认字少看不懂报纸的困难。三、宣传组用挨家串门的方式，遇见什么讲什么，并检查头一天各项宣传的效果和缺点，以便改进今后工作。四、按各阶层不同的对象，分头召开小型座谈会，在会上采取懂就讲、不懂就问的办法，使群众尽量提出自己不懂的问题，讨论解决；在会上，又可以随时检查询问群众对宣传工作的意见。
    志愿行动起来了
    群众认清了时局以后，由恐美转到仇美恨美，纷纷表示再也不信谣言了。在共产党员带头下，紧接着大家就都要求以实际行动抗美援朝保家卫国，自愿出车出马赴朝参战，纷纷表示：“要想永远过好日子，非得三股绳往一块拧，前后方齐心努力不可。”现在该村已经自愿组织了廿七付担架、五十五辆大车，很多人把已经准备好了的公粮重新风了一遍，没打完场的也加紧打场，随时准备参加战地工作。
    这个村的时事宣传工作，就从群众的切身利益出发，以支部为领导，运用组织力量，在发动大家动口、大家动手的形式下搞起来了。

    编者按：“吕家村的时事宣传搞起来了”，反映了一个事实，即，我们的某些村级干部，确是埋头积极生产，但对国家和世界的大事漠不关心。应当说，这一部分干部并不是全面的。在目前保卫世界和平反对美国侵略的抗美援朝斗争中，他们还不能负担起领导群众进行坚决斗争的任务，因为他们缺少“本钱”，“无法进行宣传”。这一关键是在于“不学习”。这种情况，在全国范围来说，当然不止一村，应当引起各地注意，迅速改变这一情况，使抗美援朝保家卫国的运动真正普及与深入到农村中去。
