　　Long Live Sino-Soviet Cultural and Artistic Exchange
    ——On the Opening of the "Chinese Art Exhibition" in Soviet Capital
    Wang Yeqiu
    The "Chinese Art Exhibition," held by the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China at the invitation of the Soviet government, opened on October 1st at the renowned Tretyakov Gallery in Moscow, the great Soviet capital.

    The exhibits are displayed in fifteen large halls. In the first hall, portraits of Chairman Mao and Marshal Stalin are displayed prominently. Above the portraits are the famous quotations of the two great leaders on Sino-Soviet friendship, flanked by the national flags of China and the Soviet Union and a large banner proclaiming "Long Live the Victory of the Chinese People." In the next two halls, large bas-reliefs of Chairman Mao and Marshal Stalin are displayed against a red silk background. The walls on both sides are lined with historical revolutionary paintings depicting the decades of arduous struggle of the Chinese people under the leadership of Chairman Mao, culminating in victory. The exhibition halls that follow are arranged chronologically, starting with painted pottery from the Yangshao culture and ending with the late Qing Dynasty. The last five halls display modern Chinese paintings, artistic photographs, New Year pictures, woodcuts, and new national paintings, interspersed with handicrafts. Fresh flowers are placed everywhere in each hall. The lights and shadows create a magnificent and beautiful atmosphere.

    The opening ceremony of the exhibition was attended by personnel from the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs, diplomatic envoys from various people's democratic countries, responsible personnel from the Moscow Soviet, Soviet combat heroes, Stakhanovite workers from large factories, figures from the literary and art circles, personnel from the Chinese Embassy, and various Chinese delegations, totaling nearly four thousand people. Lebedev, Chairman of the Exhibition Organizing Committee, delivered a speech first, saying: "This exhibition clearly demonstrates the fraternal friendship between the two great peoples of China and the Soviet Union and affirms the outstanding achievements of China in the field of art. The talented Chinese people who created this art have the right to be proud..."

    Next, Wang Jiaxiang, Chinese Ambassador to the Soviet Union, said: "The exchange of culture between China and the Soviet Union began during the October Revolution. However, the imperialists and the Chinese Kuomintang reactionaries feared contact between the cultures of China and the Soviet Union as they feared fire. Therefore, they tried their best to hinder the cultural exchange between China and the Soviet Union. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, this obstacle has been completely eliminated. Now, cultural relations between China and the Soviet Union are developing further on a new and solid foundation. Chinese cultural workers greatly respect Soviet cultural workers and will continue to learn from the Soviet Union."

    Then, Gerasimov, President of the Soviet Academy of Fine Arts, People's Artist, and recipient of the Order of Lenin and the Stalin Prize four times, delivered a speech. He said: "The opening of the Chinese Art Exhibition in Moscow is a major event for the Soviet people, as well as for the Chinese workers. This exhibition can help us more closely understand the culture and art created by the great Chinese people over thousands of years and show some new tasks and ideals of China liberated from feudal oppression. The heroic struggle of the Chinese people is most vividly reflected in the works of Yan Han, Gu Yuan, Li Hua and others. These exhibits also reflect that the patriotic Chinese people are standing together with the progressive people of the world in upholding peace."

    After the opening ceremony, thousands of guests poured into the exhibition halls.

    In the criticism book, Yuon, People's Artist of the Russian Republic, wrote: The modern painting and printmaking section is lively in content, and one can see that the painter's heart was full of enthusiastic emotions during the creation, so it can be expressed in the work. This passionate emotion and character expression move the audience. The ancient art has a high artistic value, which is known to the world.

    Soviet People's Artist Goncharovsky wrote: The oil paintings are very excellent. For example, Wu Zuoren's "Portrait of Li Yong" vividly and clearly expresses the characters. Dai Ze's "Cart Driver" and "Peace Signature" are also very good. Dong Xiwen's "Production for Self-Salvation" also gives people a deep impression, the image and color of the characters are very good. Ding Zhengxian's "Farmers Visiting Tractors" is also very expressive. Many paintings have good composition, and the expression is clear and strong.

    The famous scientist Shweitzer wrote: If you ask me in one sentence, what do I like about this exhibition and what do I want to take away? I can't say it, because I can't take the whole thing, everything is very good, and I admire it very much.

    Many guests raised various questions, and many college and middle school students held catalogues and asked us to sign them as souvenirs.

    After the opening of the "Chinese Art Exhibition," the number of visitors to the Tretyakov Gallery has doubled compared to usual. The exhibition hall is often crowded. Before opening in the morning, there is a long line waiting outside the door. Last Sunday, the gallery's historical record was broken, with more than 10,000 visitors. People waiting to buy tickets lined up from the basement of the gallery all the way to the bridge half a kilometer away. Some people waited from 10:00 in the morning until 6:00 in the afternoon to buy a ticket. The director said it was as crowded as a school of fish.

    Soviet newspapers publish articles introducing the exhibition almost every day, and publish oil painting images such as Hu Yichuan's "Unshackled", Zhao Yu's "Red Flag", and Wu Zuoren's "Portrait of Li Yong". The magazine "Art" will soon publish a special issue introducing it, with more than one hundred illustrations and papers by Zheng Zhenduo, Yan Han, and others.

　　中苏文化艺术交流万岁
    ——记苏京“中国艺术展览会”开幕
    王冶秋
    中华人民共和国中央人民政府文化部应苏联政府邀请举办的“中国艺术展览会”已于十月一日在伟大的苏联京城——莫斯科著名的特列甲科夫画馆开幕。
    展览品陈列在十五间大厅里，第一室正面陈列着毛主席，斯大林大元帅的绣像，像上面是两位伟大领袖关于中苏友谊的名言，两旁交辉着中苏两国的国旗以及大幅的“中国人民胜利万岁”的标语。接着的两间大厅，红丝织的背景前陈列着毛主席斯大林大元帅的大浮雕，两旁墙壁上陈列着表现中国人民在毛主席领导下进行了数十年的艰苦斗争，终至获得胜利的革命史画。自此以下的陈列室，是按时代顺序排列，从仰韶文化的彩陶开始，直到清末为止。最后的五间大厅，陈列着现代中国画、艺术摄影、新年画、木刻、新国画，其中并参杂地陈列了手工艺品。各厅到处都放着鲜花。灯光画影，非常辉煌美丽。
    展览会的开幕式上，到会的有苏联外交部人员、各人民民主国家的外交使节、莫斯科市苏维埃负责人员、苏联战斗英雄、大工厂的斯达哈诺夫运动者、文学界、艺术界人士，中国大使馆人员及中国各代表团，共计将近四千人。展览会筹委会主席列别捷夫首先致词，他说：“这个展览会明显地表现了中苏两个伟大人民的兄弟般的友谊，并肯定地证明着中国在艺术方面的卓越成就。创造了这种艺术的天才的中国人民，是有权骄傲的……”。
    接着，中国驻苏大使王稼祥说：“中苏文化的交流，从十月革命时候起，就已经开始。但是帝国主义者和中国的国民党反动派害怕中苏两国文化的接触如同害怕火一样，因此，他们极力阻碍中苏文化的交流。中华人民共和国成立以后，这个障碍已被彻底消除。现在中苏两国文化在新的巩固的基础上更加发展。中国文化工作者非常敬爱苏联文化工作者，并将不断地向苏联学习。”
    接着有苏联美术学院院长、人民画家、一次列宁勋章四次斯大林奖章的获得者格拉西莫夫讲演。他说：“中国艺展在莫斯科的开幕，对于苏联人民，同样对于中国的劳动者，是一个重大事件。这个展览会可以帮助我们更接近地理解伟大的中国人民在几千年来所创造的文化和艺术，并显示着从封建主义压迫下解放出来的中国一些新的任务和理想。彦涵、古元、李桦等人的作品中最鲜明地反映了中国人民的英勇斗争。这些展览品也反映出热爱祖国的中国人民正和全世界进步人类一起在拥护着和平。”
    开幕仪式以后，几千来宾拥进展览室。
    在批评簿上俄罗斯共和国人民画家犹翁写道：现代绘画和版画部分，内容生动，可以看到画家在创作之时内心充满了热烈情绪，因此才能表现在作品之中。这种热烈情绪和人物表现使观众为之激动，古代艺术品艺术价值很高，这是全世界都知道的。
    苏联人民画家冈察洛夫斯基写道：油画甚为优秀，例如吴作人的《李永像》人物表现生动而明显。戴泽的《赶车夫》及《和平签名》也很好。董希文的《生产自救》也予人以深刻印象，人物的形象与色调都很好。丁正献的《农民参观拖拉机》表现性也很强。许多画的构图很好，表现力鲜明而强烈。
    著名科学工作者什维察尔写道：如果问我一句话，对这个展览会我喜欢什么和愿意拿走什么？我不能说出来，因为我不能把整个拿走，一切都很好，使我赞羡不已。
    许多来宾提出各式各样的问题，还有许多大学生中学生拿着目录要我们签字，留作纪念。
    在“中国艺展”开幕以后，特列甲科夫画馆的观众较平时增加一倍，展览厅中经常是拥挤的，早晨还没有开门，门外就等着很长的行列。上一个星期天，更是打破了画馆的历史纪录，观众突破一万人。等着买票的由画馆的地下室一直排到一里外的桥边，有从上午十时等起，到了下午六时才买到票的。馆长说，简直像个鱼群样拥挤。
    苏联的报上几乎每天都有介绍展览会的文章发表，并且刊出了胡一川的《开镣》，赵域的《红旗》，吴作人的《李永像》等油画图片。《艺术》杂志即将出专刊介绍，将有一百幅以上的插图，并有郑振铎、彦涵等人的论文。
