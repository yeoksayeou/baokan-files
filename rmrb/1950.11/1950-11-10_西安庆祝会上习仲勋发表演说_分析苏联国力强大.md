Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 7th. Xi'an's representatives from all walks of life gathered today to warmly celebrate the 33rd anniversary of the Soviet Union's October Socialist Revolution. Xi Zhongxun, Vice Chairman of the Northwest Military and Political Committee, delivered a speech at the meeting. After exhaustively analyzing the strength of the Soviet Union and the great significance of Sino-Soviet friendship in defeating aggressors, he called on all ethnic groups in the Northwest to unite more closely, strengthen the people's armed forces, eliminate bandits and special agents, actively carry out anti-hegemony rent reduction and land reform work, and consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship. Lei Benyao, a worker from Dahua Textile Factory, said in his speech: The Soviet October Revolution brought light, freedom, and hope to mankind. We Chinese workers have just seen the light of day under the leadership of Chairman Mao, but the American bandits want to steal our fruits of victory again. We must never tolerate this. We must learn from the Soviet people's great patriotism and internationalism and strive to aid the Korean people, defend our motherland, and defeat the enemy. At the meeting, people's organizations such as the workers', youth, and women's federations presented flowers and flags to the Soviet friends who were invited to attend the meeting. Today, all schools put up large wall newspapers. Some schools also organized Yangko teams to carry out propaganda on the streets. The Masses Daily published a supplement celebrating the October Revolution.
