　　[Our Dispatch] The nine propaganda teams of Hebei High School, consisting of more than four hundred people, conducted propaganda activities separately from 10:00 AM to 3:00 PM on the 19th. The propaganda teams were active near Gulou, Houmenli, Jiaodaokou, Beixinqiao, Tieshizi Hutong, and Longfusi, among other places. There were over six thousand spectators. The various forms of propaganda were warmly welcomed. For example, after Propaganda Team Two-C finished their propaganda program, the audience did not leave and asked them to continue performing. They had no choice but to perform another crosstalk segment. Propaganda Team Two-B performed a short play near Longfusi, depicting the atrocities of how Japanese devils and American devils bullied the Chinese people and raped women. Some people were wiping their tears directly. They unanimously expressed their infinite hatred for American imperialism and Japanese devils.
    In order to better carry out this propaganda movement, the captains of each propaganda team held a joint meeting at 6:30 PM that day. At the meeting, they exchanged information about the day's propaganda activities, summarized experiences, and pointed out shortcomings. The meeting also decided to contact nearby police stations and conduct propaganda in various hutongs.

　　冀高九个宣传队分头出动总结经验准备深入各胡同
    【本报讯】河北高中的九个宣传队四百余人，于十九日上午十点到下午三点分头进行了宣传。宣传队活动于鼓楼、后门里、交道口、北新桥、铁狮子胡同和隆福寺等地附近。观众约六千多人。各种形式的宣传受到了热烈欢迎。如二丙宣传队，演完宣传节目后，观众都不走，要求继续再演，他们只好又表演了一段相声。二乙宣传队在隆福寺附近演出了一个活报剧，内容是日寇跟美国鬼子怎样欺侮中国老百姓和强奸妇女的暴行，有些人直擦眼泪。一致表示了对美帝和日寇的无限愤恨。
    为了更好的开展这个宣传运动，各宣传队的队长于当日下午六点半召开了一个联席会，会上交换了当日的宣传情况，总结了经验，指出了缺点。会上并决定了和附近派出所联络，到各个胡同中宣传。
