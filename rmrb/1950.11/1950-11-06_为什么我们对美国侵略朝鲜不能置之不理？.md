The flames of the American aggressors' war of aggression against Korea have long extended to our Taiwan in the south, and now they are spreading to the banks of the Yalu and Tumen Rivers in the north. The American air force is increasingly frequently attacking our border areas. Now all the facts have thoroughly shattered the sweet talk of the American imperialists and their foreign assistants, and nakedly exposed the sinister plot of the United States to lead the war of aggression to China. The Chinese people must not sit idly by and ignore this serious situation in the Korean War. Precisely because of this, patriotic people from all walks of life in various places have recently advocated taking voluntary action to resist America and aid Korea, and protect our homes and defend our country.

In this emergency, the democratic parties of China issued a joint declaration on the 4th, clearly stating the solemn position of the Chinese people on the Korean issue, and warmly supporting the demands of patriotic people in various places to take voluntary action to resist America and aid Korea, and protect our homes and defend our country. The joint declaration of the various parties is an extremely important historical document. It faithfully expresses the common opinions and common program of action of the 475 million Chinese people to the whole world. We fully and unreservedly support this great and just declaration. Here, we would like to elaborate on the Korean War and the vital interests of our people, in order to help readers understand the significance of this declaration more thoroughly.

Why are the American fascist butchers, who are baring their fangs and brandishing their claws in front of the people of the world, so eager to attack the Korean people? And why, while invading Korea, did they immediately send American naval and air forces to invade our Taiwan Province; and at the same time announce that they would intensify their armed aggression against Vietnam and the Philippines? Why has the American air force invading Korea repeatedly intruded into our airspace, carrying out wanton strafing and bombing; and the American navy invading Korea has shelled our merchant ships? Why is the United States so frantically expanding the war of aggression to our border without any scruples? This is obviously not an isolated or accidental event, but part of the overall military and political plan of the United States.

The American capitalists saw that after the Second World War, the German, Italian, and Japanese fascists had all fallen, the capitalist world was greatly weakened, and many people's democratic countries had emerged in the world. The world peace and democracy camp headed by the great socialist Soviet Union was unprecedentedly strong, so they tried to escape their crisis by expanding aggression. This aggressive plan of American imperialism takes Europe and Asia as its two main targets. The center of Asia is China, with a population of 475 million; to seize China is to seize the entire Asia. After the end of the Second World War, the United States made great efforts to seize China through Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang, but suffered a tragic defeat. Chiang Kai-shek was overthrown, and the People's Republic of China appeared on the political stage of Asia and the world. But were the American adventurers willing to give up? No, absolutely not. Chairman Mao Zedong warned at the preparatory meeting of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in June 1949: "Here, I think it is necessary to draw people's attention to the fact that the imperialists and their running dogs, the Chinese reactionaries, will not be reconciled to their failure in China. They will still collude with each other and oppose the Chinese people by all possible means. ... If they still want to take risks, it is not impossible to send part of their troops to harass China's borders." The United States decided to launch an offensive against China from three main directions: Korea, Taiwan, and Vietnam. Truman himself confirmed this in his order on June 27th. After the United States created the South Korean puppet's attack on the North Korean people, Truman immediately ordered the dispatch of large-scale naval, land, and air forces to invade Korea, while openly seizing Taiwan and strengthening intervention in Vietnam. Among these three directions, Korea is of course the most important one. After the United States completes its aggression against Korea, its sharp knife can be inserted into China's chest.

The Chinese people and the people of the world will never forget that this whole set of aggression plans of the United States in the East is a reprint of the "Northward Advance Doctrine" and "Continental Policy" that Japanese imperialism had long implemented.

As early as before the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895, the representatives of the Japanese northward advance aggression policy, Takamori Saigo and Hirobumi Ito, had already advocated the "Theory of Conquering Korea," and used the pro-Japanese faction in Korea at that time (the so-called "Enlightenment Party") to create a coup. In 1894, Japan and China engaged in land and sea battles in Korea, South Manchuria, Shandong, Taiwan and other places, the so-called Sino-Japanese War, and after defeating China, forced the Qing government to sign the Treaty of Shimonoseki. As a result, Japan not only controlled Korea, but also seized China's Taiwan and other places. Next, Japan coveted China's Northeast from Korea. As a result of the Russo-Japanese War in 1905, Japan also seized Lushun and Dalian and various privileges in South Manchuria according to the Treaty of Portsmouth. In 1910, Japan formally annexed Korea, and continued to use Korea as a base to carry out aggression against China's Northeast and Shandong. By the September 18 Incident of 1931, Japan finally realized the step of completely occupying Northeast China. After that, Japan successively attacked Rehe, eastern Hebei, and Suiyuan, threatening North China. After the July 7th Incident in 1937, Japanese fascists launched a full-scale offensive against China; and after the Pearl Harbor Incident in 1942, they spread the flames of war throughout Southeast Asia. This series of aggressive steps by Japan was most clearly stated in the memorial presented by Japanese Prime Minister Giichi Tanaka to the Japanese Emperor in 1927. Giichi Tanaka said: "Stealing the late Emperor Meiji's legacy, the first phase is to conquer Taiwan, the second phase is to conquer Korea,... the third phase is to destroy Manchuria and Mongolia, and to conquer the entire territory of China, so that the alien southern seas and the entire Asian belt will be afraid of me, obey me, and look up to me." He also said: "To conquer China, we must first conquer Manchuria and Mongolia, and to conquer the world, we must first conquer China. If China can be completely conquered by our country, other ethnic groups with different clothes in Asia Minor and India, etc., will be afraid of me, respect me, and surrender to me, so that the world knows that East Asia is my East Asia, and will never dare to invade me."

Japanese fascists were defeated, but their mantle was inherited by the American aggressors. Tanaka's memorial was repeated by Truman in his recent speech in San Francisco. Although it is an old tune, the rhythm is still accurate. For example, Tanaka said "conquer Korea", Truman changed it to "deal with the aggression of Korea"; Tanaka said "East Asia is my East Asia", Truman changed it to "Asian countries are the foundation of our industrial society"; Tanaka said "conquer the world", Truman changed it to "establish the rule of law in the world". What is even more greedy than Tanaka is Truman's eagerness to directly expand his war of aggression from Korea. He shouted that "the United Nations' actions in Korea are of paramount importance" and "are a huge step in the long struggle to establish the rule of law in the world." He announced "We are at war" and will "expand this kind of work to help human progress."

In the previous period, the United States tried its best to conceal its steps in launching a war and rapidly expanding the war of aggression from Korea. American Secretary of the Navy Matthews declared in a speech in Boston on August 25 this year that "we are willing to pay any price, even to start a war," "we will be called the initiator of a war of aggression for this, and we will accept it with peace of mind." At that time, the spokesperson of the US State Department and the White House Press Office hurriedly declared that this "does not represent the policy of the United States." MacArthur's statement on invading Taiwan in a telegram to the American Overseas Veterans Association, which was published on the same day as Matthews' speech, was also ordered by Truman to be "revoked." But the facts have long proved that this is just an act of the American aggressors covering their ears and stealing the bell. Not long ago, when the American aggressor army approached the 38th parallel, the US government released the air, claiming that "the US military will stop at the 38th parallel." Later, it was said that the US military "should stop a little further away from the Soviet and Chinese borders." But the facts have again proved that these are all lies. Until now, the American aggressor army has approached the Yalu River, and the spokespersons of American imperialism are still spreading smoke, "guaranteeing that MacArthur's army advancing in North Korea will not advance beyond the Korean border." But according to historical experience, isn't making this kind of statement precisely a sign that the American aggressors are about to "advance beyond the Korean border"?

The letter from Yin Bingqiu, an advisor to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Lee Seung-man puppet government, to Lee Seung-man, which was seized by the Korean People's Army, and the November 2 New York telegram from the Telecommunications Agency regarding the US military's strategic plan in China, can help us specifically understand the content of the plan. Yin Bingqiu said in a letter to Lee Seung-man on December 3, 1948: "Under the leadership of the supreme commander, actions must be coordinated in three aspects. These three aspects are: the Japanese must advance through Vladivostok along the northeastern salient; Korean and American troops, after liberating our northern territory, must pass through the Liaodong Peninsula and reach Harbin; the Chinese Kuomintang troops must recover the lost territory of China (including Liaodong Province). After the victory of the war, Korean and American troops must occupy Manchuria. ... In the next stage of transforming the Far East, Japan must gain dominance, and hand over Vladivostok and part of Siberia to it." This foreign affairs advisor also attached a draft of the so-called "Korean-American Alliance Treaty" in a letter to Lee Seung-man on April 18, 1949, in which Article 7 wrote: "The war must continue on the territory of Manchuria." "The President of the Republic of Korea guarantees that, in addition to revitalizing North Korea, where the main interests of the Republic of Korea lie, the development of natural resources in Manchuria and other parts of eastern China will be transferred to the joint management of the United States and Korea." The news from the Telecommunications Agency said: The strategic plan adopted by the United States "in the event of taking military action in China," which had been approved by Truman, is divided into two parts. "The first part details the strategic importance of Korea and Taiwan in completing the US's basic goals in the 'struggle against the expansion of Asian communism' and in 'protecting US economic interests in Asia.' The other part discusses several changes in the political situation involving the second half of this year and the beginning of next year, and calculates 'direct military intervention' 'in China' with the participation of US troops. ... The US High Command recommends using Korean territory and Korean troops to conduct operations in Manchuria and some areas in the north as part of the strategic plan. The territories and military bases of Indochina, Burma, and Hong Kong will be used as bases on the southern front for attacking South China. Powerful paratroop forces will be transported from Taiwan to areas around Shanghai and other areas in Central and South China." As usual, the US government will not admit these proofs that expose its conspiracy. But aren't the actual actions of the United States in expanding its aggression today making people believe in the reliability of these proofs?

The flames of war have already burned to our doorstep, the arsonists have exposed their ambitions, how can we Chinese people who are in front of the aggressor's blade turn a blind eye? How can we sit idly by? How can our enthusiastic compatriots not rise up to take voluntary action to resist America and aid Korea, and protect our homes and defend our country?

Or some people may think: although the enemy is now approaching our Yalu River and Tumen River with its army, although it is bombing and strafing our borders with its air force, and although it is plundering our Taiwan with its navy, it has not yet launched a large-scale attack on our territory. Japan's armed invasion of Korea was in 1894, and the occupation of the Northeast was in 1930, with a gap of 36 years. Wouldn't it be better if we tried our best to avoid any pretext for the enemy to attack, and used this gap to carry out peaceful construction?

Such a thought is wrong, because it assumes that the enemy who has already launched the offensive will allow us to have the time and environment for peaceful construction, but this is not in accordance with the facts. Today's United States is different from the previous Japan. The United States does not need and cannot stop in Korea for as long as Japan did. Moreover, Japan did not really stop in Korea at that time, it still invaded South Manchuria. We can never wait for the enemy to have mercy and give us time and environment for peaceful construction, but only rely on resolute struggle to strive for it. The enemy does not know "mercy" and does not rely on excuses. The enemy's actions are determined by the struggle of strength. If the enemy cannot attack us, he will not look for excuses; if we cannot or are not prepared to resist the enemy, then we will never be able to eliminate the enemy's excuses, but only encourage the enemy's desire to attack. Please recall 1930 and 1937, when the Chinese people did not help Korea, and even did not help their own compatriots who were oppressed by the enemy, but didn't the enemy still easily create excuses for the attack?

Such a thought is wrong, because it assumes that the enemy cannot be defeated, but this is completely contrary to the facts. Today's United States is different from the previous Japan. They are in a completely different world. When Japan invaded Korea, there was no peace and democracy camp in the world, no Soviet Union, no People's Republic of China and Democratic People's Republic of Korea. In China, there was the reactionary rule of Empress Dowager Cixi and Li Hongzhang, and in Korea, there was the reactionary rule of Daewongun Yi Ha-eung and Prime Minister Kim Hong-jip. When Japan invaded Northeast China, there was the Soviet Union, but it was not as strong as it is today, and China was still the reactionary China of Chiang Kai-shek. But what about today? Today, there is a peace and democracy camp headed by the powerful Soviet Union in the world, and its strength far exceeds the imperialist aggression camp. Today, there is a powerful People's Republic of China allied with the Soviet Union in the East. It is firmly opposed to imperialist aggression. It has grown up in the process of defeating imperialist aggressors and their running dogs. Its strength is far beyond what the Qing Dynasty and Chiang Kai-shek can compare with. Today, the Korean people have experienced five years of liberation in the northern half, and in the southern half, they have also realized the only way to Korean independence and liberation from tortuous struggles, especially in the recent four months of struggle. Although the Korean people have suffered setbacks in the face of the temporarily dominant enemy, the Korean people's liberation struggle is still in full swing, and the position of the American aggressors in Korea is still unstable, fragile and dangerous. The voluntary action of the Chinese people will give the Korean people unlimited encouragement and confidence, enabling them to reverse the entire war situation, to eliminate and drive away the unstable American aggressor army, and to force the aggressors to accept a just and peaceful solution to the Korean issue.

It is obvious that only under this circumstance can the imperialist aggressors be taught a lesson, can peace in Korea and the Far East be restored, can China be spared from aggression, and can it engage in peaceful construction under safe conditions.

Therefore, as the joint declaration of the democratic parties said, we must resolutely support the just efforts of the Chinese people to resist America and aid Korea and protect our homes and defend our country through voluntary action. Let us pay tribute to the glorious patriotic volunteers who resist America and aid Korea and protect our homes and defend our country! Let us cheer for them! Let the people of the whole country unite and support them!

### 为什么我们对美国侵略朝鲜不能置之不理？

　　为什么我们对美国侵略朝鲜不能置之不理？
    美国侵略者侵略朝鲜战争的火焰，在南面早已延伸到我国的台湾，在北面现在竟扩大到我国的鸭绿江边和图们江边了。美国的空军，愈来愈频繁地向我国边境袭击。现在一切事实，都彻底地打碎了美帝国主义及其外国助理人的花言巧语，赤裸裸地暴露了美国将侵略战争引向中国的罪恶阴谋。我国人民决不能坐视朝鲜战争的这种严重形势而置之不理。正因为这样，近日各地各阶层的爱国人民，纷纷主张以志愿行动来抗美援朝，保家卫国。
    在这种紧急的情形之下，中国各民主党派在四日发表联合宣言，明确地说明中国人民对于朝鲜问题的严正立场，并对各地爱国人民以志愿行动抗美援朝保家卫国的要求，加以热烈的支持。各党派联合宣言是一个极端重要的历史文件。它向全世界忠实地表达了中国四万七千五百万人民的共同意见和共同的行动纲领。我们完全无保留地拥护这个伟大的正义的宣言。在这里，我们愿就朝鲜战争和我国人民的切身利害关系，加以申述，以便帮助读者更透彻地了解这个宣言的意义。
    在世界人民面前张牙舞爪的美国法西斯屠夫，为什么急于向朝鲜人民开刀呢？又为什么在其侵略朝鲜的同时，立即派遣美国的海军和空军侵略我国的台湾省；并且同时宣布它对越南、菲律宾加紧武装侵略呢？为什么美国侵朝的空军竟连续侵入我国领空，肆行扫射与轰炸；侵朝的美国海军竟炮击我国的航海商船呢？为什么美国竟然这样疯狂地把侵略战争扩大到我国边境而无所忌惮呢？这显然不是什么孤立的偶然的事件，而是美国整个军事政治计划的一部分。
    美国大资本家看到在第二次世界大战以后，德意日法西斯都倒了，资本主义世界是大大衰落了，世界上出现了许多人民民主国家，以伟大社会主义苏联为首的世界和平民主阵线空前强大，因此就力谋用扩大侵略的方法来逃脱自己的危机。美帝国主义的这种侵略计划，以欧洲和亚洲为两个主要目标。亚洲的重心是一个拥有四万七千五百万人口的中国；夺取了中国，就等于夺取了整个亚洲。在世界第二次大战结束以后，美国曾经用极大的努力经过蒋介石的国民党来夺取中国，但是遭到了悲惨的失败。蒋介石被打倒了，中华人民共和国出现在亚洲和世界的政治舞台上了。但是美国的冒险者就此甘心了吗？没有，绝对不是这样。毛泽东主席在一九四九年六月在中国人民政治协商会议筹备会上就发出警告说：“在这里，我认为有必要唤起人们的注意，这即是：帝国主义者及其走狗中国反动派对于他们在中国这块土地上的失败，是不会甘心的。他们还会要互相勾结在一起，用各种可能的方法，反对中国人民。……假如他们还想冒险的话，派出一部分兵力侵扰中国的边境，也不是不可能的。”美国决定从三个主要方向来实行对于中国的进攻：朝鲜、台湾和越南。杜鲁门自己在六月二十七日的命令证实了这一点。美国制造了南朝鲜傀儡对于北朝鲜人民的进攻以后，杜鲁门随即下令派遣海陆空军大举侵入朝鲜，同时公开地夺取台湾，和加强干涉越南。在这三个方向中间，朝鲜当然是最重要的一个。美国完成了对朝鲜的侵略以后，它的一把尖刀就可以插进中国的胸膛了。
    中国人民和世界人民决不会忘记，美国在东方的这一整套侵略计划，是日本帝国主义早已实行过的“北进主义”和“大陆政策”的再版。
    远在一八九四年中日甲午战争以前，日本北进主义侵略政策的代表西乡隆盛、伊藤博文之流就已经鼓吹“征韩论”，利用当时朝鲜的亲日派（所谓“开化党”）制造政变。一八九四年，日本与中国在朝鲜、南满、山东、台湾等地进行了陆战和海战，即所谓甲午之战，并在战胜中国之后强迫满清政府签订了中日马关条约。日本由此不但控制了朝鲜，而且夺取了中国的台湾等地。接着，日本就从朝鲜进而觊觎中国的东北。一九○五年日俄战争的结果，日本又根据朴资茅斯条约，夺取了旅顺大连和在南满的种种特权。一九一○年，日本正式吞并朝鲜，并继续利用朝鲜作为基地向中国东北和山东施行侵略。到了一九三一年的九一八事变，日本终于实现了全部侵占中国东北的步骤。此后，日本连续进攻热河、冀东和绥远，威胁华北。一九三七年七七事变之后，日本法西斯就向全中国大举进攻；并于一九四二年珍珠港事件之后，把战火烧遍东南亚。日本的这一连串侵略步骤，在一九二七年日本首相田中义一给日本天皇的奏折中说得最清楚。田中义一说：“窃明治大帝之遗策，第一期征服台湾，第二期征服朝鲜，……第三期灭亡满蒙，以及征服中国全土，使异服之南洋及亚细亚全带无不畏我服我仰我鼻息。”又说：“欲征服中国必先征服满蒙，欲征服世界必先征服中国。倘中国完全可被我国征服，其他如小中亚细亚及印度南洋等异服之民族，必畏我敬我而降于我，使世界知东亚为我之东亚，永不敢向我侵犯。”
    日本法西斯被打倒了，它的衣钵却被美国侵略者继承下来了。当年田中的奏折，被杜鲁门最近在旧金山演说中重弹了一遍。虽然是旧调翻新，但板眼依然不差。比如，田中说的是“征服朝鲜”，杜鲁门就说成了“对付朝鲜的侵略”；田中说的是“东亚为我之东亚”，杜鲁门就说成了“亚洲各国是我国工业社会的基础”；田中说的是“征服世界”，杜鲁门就说成了“在世界上建立法治”。而比田中表现得更贪馋的则是杜鲁门急欲从朝鲜直接扩大其侵略战争。他大叫“联合国在朝鲜的行动具有至高无上的重要性”，“是为了要在世界上建立法治的历久斗争中的巨大的一步”。他宣布“我们在进行战争”，而且要“扩大这一类帮助人类进步的工作”。
    美国在前一个时期还极力隐蔽它发动战争并从朝鲜迅速扩大侵略战争的步骤。美国海军部长马休斯于今年八月二十五日在波士顿演说时宣称“我们甘愿偿付任何代价，甚至发动战争”，“我们会因此被称为侵略战争的发动者，我们也心安理得地接受”。当时美国国务院发言人和白宫新闻处曾慌忙声明这“并不代表美国的政策”。与马休斯演说同日发表的麦克阿瑟致美国海外退伍军人协会的电报中关于侵略台湾的声明，也曾被杜鲁门下令加以“撤消”。但是事实早已证明这只是美国侵略者掩耳盗铃的把戏。不久以前，当着美国侵略军逼近三八线的时候，美国政府又曾放出空气，声称“美军将停止于三八线”。后来又说是美军“应在距离苏联与中国边境稍远一些的地方即行停止”。但是事实又证明了这些都只是谎话。直到目前，美国侵略军逼近了鸭绿江，美帝国主义的代言人仍然在散布烟幕，“保证在北朝鲜进军的麦克阿瑟军队不会推进到朝鲜边界以外”。但是按照历史的经验，作出这种声明，难道不正是美国侵略者将要“推进到朝鲜边界以外”的预兆吗？
    由朝鲜人民军所缴获的李承晚傀儡政府的外务部顾问尹炳求致李承晚的信件，和电通社十一月二日纽约电所报道的美国高级军界人士关于美军在中国的战略计划，可以帮助我们具体地了解计划的内容。尹炳求在一九四八年十二月三日给李承晚的信上说：“必须在最高统帅的领导下，从三方面配合行动。这三方面就是：日本人必须沿着东北部突出地带穿过海参崴前进；朝鲜和美国的军队在解放了我们的北部领土后，必须穿过辽东半岛进抵哈尔滨；中国国民党的军队必须光复中国失去的领土（其中包括辽东省）。在战争胜利结束后，朝鲜和美国军队必须占领满洲。……在改造远东的下一阶段中，日本必须取得统治势力，将海参崴和西伯利亚的一部分交给它。”这个外务部顾问又在一九四九年四月十八日致李承晚的信中，附了所谓“韩美同盟条约”的草案，其中第七条写着：“战争一定要在满洲领土上继续进行。”“大韩民国总统除了复兴大韩民国主要利益所在的北朝鲜以外，保证将满洲和中国东部其他部分的天然资源的发展移交美国和韩国联合管理。”电通社的消息说：曾经杜鲁门批准的美国“一旦要在中国采取军事行动”时采用的战略计划分为两部。“第一部，详细谈到朝鲜和台湾对于完成美国在‘反对亚洲共产主义扩张的斗争’中的基本目标和对于‘保护美国在亚洲的经济利益’的战略重要性。另一部，讨论政治形势的几个变化涉及今年下半年和明年初，并计算到以美国军队参加‘在中国进行’直接的‘军事干涉’。……美国高级指挥部建议利用朝鲜领土和朝鲜军队在满洲和北方某些地区进行作战，作为战略计划的一部分。印度支那、缅甸和香港的领土以及军事基地将被用作进攻华南的南方前线上的基地。强大的伞兵部队将由台湾运往上海周围地区及华中华南的其他地区。”美国政府对于这些暴露其阴谋的凭证，照例是不会承认的。但是今天美国扩大侵略的实际行动，难道不正是使人们相信这些凭证的可靠吗？
    战火已经烧到我们的门前了，放火者已经暴露了他们的野心了，我们处在侵略者刀锋之前的中国人民，怎样能够熟视无睹？怎样能够置之不理？我们的热血同胞，怎样能够不纷纷起来以志愿行动抗美援朝，保家卫国？
    或者有人会想：敌人现在虽然以陆军逼近我们的鸭绿江图们江，虽然以空军轰炸扫射我们的边境，虽然以海军掠夺我们的台湾，但是究竟还没有大举进攻我们的国土。日本武装侵略朝鲜在一八九四年，而占领东北则在一九三○年，前后还有三十六年。如果我们竭力避免敌人进攻的任何借口，利用这个空隙来进行和平建设不是更好吗？
    这样的想法是错误的，因为它以为已经发起了进攻的敌人会允许我们有和平建设的时间和环境，而这却不合乎事实。今天的美国和以前的日本不同，美国不需要也不可能像日本那样停止在朝鲜那样久。而且日本当时也没有真正停止在朝鲜，它还是侵略了南满。我们永远不能够等待敌人大发慈悲给予我们以和平建设的时间和环境，而只有依靠坚决的奋斗来争取。敌人是不知道“慈悲”，也不依赖借口的，敌人的行动决定于力量的斗争。如果敌人不能够进攻我们，他就不去寻找借口了；如果我们不能够或不准备抵抗敌人，那么我们就永远不能消灭敌人的借口，而只能鼓励敌人进攻的欲望。请回想一九三○年和一九三七年吧，当时中国人民并没有去援助朝鲜，甚至也没有去援助被敌人压迫的中国自己的同胞，但是敌人不是仍然很容易地造出了进攻的借口吗？
    这样的想法是错误的，因为它以为敌人是不能够战胜的，而这却完全违反事实。今天的美国和以前的日本不同，它们是处在完全不同的世界。在日本进攻朝鲜的时候，世界上还没有什么和平民主阵营，没有苏联，没有中华人民共和国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国，在中国有的是西太后和李鸿章的反动统治，在朝鲜有的是大院君李罡应和总理大臣金宏集的反动统治。在日本进攻中国东北的时候，有了苏联，但是没有今天这样的强大，而中国仍然是反动的蒋介石的中国。但是今天呢？今天在全世界有了以强大的苏联为首的和平民主阵营，它的力量远胜于帝国主义侵略阵营。今天在东方有了强大的与苏联同盟的中华人民共和国，它是坚决反对帝国主义侵略的，它是在战胜帝国主义侵略者及其走狗的过程中生长起来的，它的力量远非满清和蒋介石所能够比拟。今天的朝鲜人民在北半部已经经历了五年的解放，在南半部也已经从曲折的斗争特别是最近四个多月的斗争中认清了朝鲜独立解放的唯一道路。朝鲜人民虽然在暂时居于优势的敌人面前受了挫折，但是朝鲜人民的解放斗争仍然是如火如荼地继续进行着，而美国侵略者在朝鲜的地位也仍然是不稳定的，脆弱的和危险的。中国人民的志愿行动将使朝鲜人民得到无限的鼓励和信心，使他们有可能转变整个的战局，有可能消灭和逐退立脚未稳的美国侵略军，并有可能强迫侵略者接受对于朝鲜问题的公正的和平的解决。
    十分明显，只有在这种情形之下，帝国主义侵略分子才能够得到教训，朝鲜和远东的和平才能够恢复，中国才能够免于被侵略，才能够在安全的条件下从事和平建设。
    因此，正如各民主党派联合宣言所说，我们必须坚决拥护中国人民以志愿行动抗美援朝保家卫国的正义努力。让我们向以志愿行动抗美援朝保家卫国的光荣的爱国志士们致敬！让我们向他们欢呼万岁！让我们全国人民团结一致作他们的后盾！
