Workers in Northeast, North China, Northwest and Other Regions
    Love the Motherland and Widely Launch Production Competitions
    More Than 40 Units in the Northeast Region Have Responded to the Challenge from the Zhao Guoyou Lathe Team
    The Motor Group of the Tianjin Electric Motor Factory No. 2 Created Four New Records in One Day
    [Report from this newspaper] Workers in various regions are responding to the provocative actions of the American aggressors by launching patriotic production competitions.
    Northeast
    Workers in factories throughout the Northeast region are actively responding to the call of the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions to answer the production competition challenge proposed by the Zhao Guoyou lathe team. More than forty production units have now formally responded to the competition challenge. The Meng Tai team of a certain steel plant repair shop, who attended the National Labor Model Representative Conference, proposed in their letter of response: In addition to ensuring the completion of production tasks, they will also do a good job in winterizing and will use waste steam for heating this winter, saving the state 4.95 billion Northeast yuan worth of steam. A state-owned chemical plant in Jilin Province completed its annual production plan in early October and is now using the completion of the state's additional tasks as a condition for responding to the challenge. More than 17,000 employees of a certain mine stated in their letter of response: In order to oppose the aggression of American imperialism, defend the peaceful construction of the motherland and their own happy lives, they will strictly abide by technical operating procedures, eliminate all accidents, resolutely prevent sabotage activities by bad elements, and strive to complete this year's production tasks and construction tasks ahead of schedule. During the discussion of all employees of the oil refining plant of the Shenyang Chemical Plant, in addition to ensuring the implementation of air defense and anti-espionage work, they will also eliminate responsibility accidents, and ensure that the attendance rate is raised to more than 97% even in the presence of chlorine gas. All the workers in the ninth workshop of the Shenyang No. 1 Garment Factory also proposed to ensure that 99.5% of the products are qualified to respond to the challenge from the Zhao Guoyou lathe team. In their letter of response to the Zhao Guoyou lathe team, they wrote: "We are responding to your challenge, and we hope that we will work together to realize the guaranteed conditions, so as to oppose the crazy aggression of American imperialism, defend the motherland, and defend our good life." The Chen Yucai advanced workshop of the No. 5 Machine Factory of the Northeast Machinery Administration, the No. 1 Glass Factory, the No. 1 Nail Factory, the Mechanical Branch of the Huanggu Tun Railway Factory, and various parts of the workers of the Anshan Iron and Steel Company have also risen to respond to the challenge, proposing to improve quality and complete tasks ahead of schedule. The general trade unions of Songjiang and Harbin provinces and cities called on all workers to join this patriotic labor competition and vowed to work hard to complete and exceed the original production tasks ahead of schedule. In the competition movement, labor models and Communist Youth League members are playing a leading role. Wang Baohong and Bi Guiying, the nationally renowned female train drivers, expressed their determination to strive for 100,000 kilometers without accidents. Liang Chao Xiang, a labor hero and young driver, asked to go to work while sick. Xia Yunxiang, a member of the Communist Youth League of the Andong Machine Factory, broke the quota working hours for drilling belt pulley grooves on the rocker arm of a drilling machine by more than one time. All the members of the Communist Youth League of the No. 2 Woolen Textile Factory in Northeast China have made plans to complete the task ahead of schedule or in excess of the quota.
    Workers in Lushun-Dalian have achieved many successes in the anti-American aggression production competition. After the Third Weaving Factory of the Jinzhou Textile Factory launched the competition, production efficiency increased by more than 8% compared with the past, exceeding the production plan by 20%, and the quality was also improved compared with the past. In September, the fifth shift of Class C produced 22 third-class products. Since the beginning of October to the 20th, only one second-class product has been produced. The workers of the rolling mill of a certain steel plant loudly proposed: "The more steel we roll, the more sinews we draw from the American imperialists!" Under this slogan, the daily output of the factory on the 17th increased by 10.7% compared with the new record on the 16th, and one rolling mill completed the October production task five days ahead of schedule. The number of grooved nails machined daily by the workers of a certain factory has also increased by 1.9 times compared with the past. In the past, the daily loss rate of the kiln-out team of the Dalian Kiln Factory accounted for 0.31% of the total output, but now it has been reduced to 0.036%. The loss rate of the kiln-loading team has been reduced from 0.175% to 0.062%. The Xi Yi Factory affiliated to the Lushun-Dalian Court has completed the production plan for manufacturing tractors ahead of schedule. The employees of other factories are also stepping up their work in the competition to ensure that they complete their production tasks ahead of schedule. Railway workers in Linkou Locomotive Depot, Harbin and other places have also proposed to ensure the completion of transportation tasks and safe operation as the conditions for launching a patriotic production competition.
    North China
    Workers in various parts of North China are extremely excited about opposing American imperialist aggression. Railway workers are intensifying production to oppose American imperialist aggression and enrich the national defense forces of the people's motherland. The competition to complete the annual task ahead of schedule is gradually developing. Under the leadership of labor model Jiang Zhenyuan, the De County Works Section completed the annual 148.6 kilometers of road maintenance work on October 15, eliminated the slow running within its jurisdiction, and is now carrying out the second round of trunk line maintenance work. At the same time, due to the proper organization of the labor force, the construction project saved a total of about 200,000 catties of millet in engineering costs. The Pingdiquan Works Section also completed its annual task ahead of schedule on October 20, increasing the line speed from 30 kilometers to 50 kilometers, saving more than 380 million yuan in construction costs. Tianjin Station completed the October loading task five days ahead of schedule, and is now continuing to participate in the anti-American production competition. After completing the annual task ahead of schedule, Beijing Xizhimen Station challenged all stations to complete the loading plan for the excess fourth quarter half a month ahead of schedule.
    In the vigorous patriotic production competition, the production of many state-owned and public factories in Tianjin in October has reached a higher level. The output of cotton clothes in the Tianjin Clothing Factory of the North China Military Region in October exceeded the plan by an average of 22%, and the return rate was lower than 50% of the administrative regulations.
    The monthly output of four major products of Tianjin Steel Plant, such as steel ingots, exceeded the plan by 68% to 170%; among them, two types had exceeded 2% to 20% of the annual plan by the end of October. There are already five types of first-class products in the factory that have reached 100%. Under the leadership of labor model Pan Changyou, the employees of the steelmaking department of the factory took the slogan of "One more ton of steel, one more point of national defense strength," turning anger into strength, and successfully overfulfilled the October production plan. The electromechanical department launched a challenge among all groups, and successively put forward guarantees for the patriotic production competition. For example, the competition conditions first proposed by the Sun Shaozhi team included six items. In addition to ensuring that there are no production accidents, completing the task ahead of schedule, tidying up tools on time, and strengthening unity inside and outside the team, it also proposed to ensure good quality and that the scrap rate of castings does not exceed 0.5%. The electric furnace plant of the department had already completed the annual production task two months ahead of schedule at the end of last month and exceeded 20%. Now it is guaranteed to exceed the annual task by 20% before the end of the year. After this major production victory, the plant immediately divided the eighteen workers in the long day shift into black and white shifts to work, and resolutely guaranteed to reduce the time by half to complete the current task of 30 tons of copper castings. Now all the employees of the electromechanical department have invested in the patriotic competition, and even the welding team that does odd jobs has put forward the challenge condition of not doing a rework and not wasting a welding rod.
    On the basis that the production competition in Tianjin Electric Motor Factory No. 2 has become regularized, the employees have successively proposed greater guarantees for stepping up production, and have continuously created many new records. On October 28, the workers of the motor team created four new records in one day, completing the unprecedented highest monthly output three days ahead of schedule. In addition to completing the original planned products, the transformer team also produced 30% more products in excess. All the staff of the technical section of the factory also expressed that they would do their best to complete the few radio parts that cannot be self-made as soon as possible. Tian Linsheng, a fitter of the No. 1 team of Tianjin Textile Machinery No. 2 Factory, increased his work efficiency by one-sixth. Wang Jinyou and Chen Jingting of the No. 1 mechanical team make small curved shafts for cloth machines. The original plan was 70 pieces, but now it has been increased to 80 pieces. Wu Shoupeng of the second team makes large plates. He used to make eight pieces per worker, but now he makes ten pieces per worker. Wang Deshan, the labor model representative of Tianjin No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory who attended the National Labor Model Conference, is preparing to lead the labor models of the whole factory to challenge the cotton textile factories in the city. Sun Guilan, a special labor model in the city, is also actively leading the workers in her team to prepare for the competition. Private Hengyuan Textile Factory and others have also launched patriotic production competitions one after another.
    Northwest
    The production competitions launched by workers in major cities in Northwest China to oppose the American imperialist aggression against Taiwan and Korea and to safeguard national security and world peace are in full swing. After the First Factory of Northwest Textile Construction Company launched the competition, the production volume per loom has increased by an average of 19%, and the rate of second-class cloth has dropped from 6% to 0.9%. The Baoji Locomotive Depot and Tongguan Locomotive Depot of the Xi'an Railway Bureau have successfully concluded the half-month safe driving campaign. The locomotives of the Baoji Locomotive Depot safely turned around 17,294 kilometers, guaranteeing the punctual departure of 94 locomotives, and there was not a single accident. In the first stage of the competition in September, the average hourly output of weaving machines in the Northwest Woolen Textile Factory in Lanzhou increased from 2.05 meters to more than 2.5 meters. Among them, worker Chen Xueren has achieved the highest record of 3.03 meters, and all products meet the standards. After worker Wu Shoukui of the blending room of the factory tried to improve the machine, he overcame the phenomenon that spots occurred in the dyeing of finished products in the past. The output of the Lanzhou Automobile Repair Factory in September exceeded the original plan by 200%, and the construction project of the Yellow River Bridge was completed ahead of schedule. The repair factory of the Logistics Department of the Ningxia Military Region and the Ningxia People's Machine Factory have both overfulfilled their production tasks in the production competition. A number of clothing, footwear, leather making, and machinery factories in Xinjiang have now also been swept into a tense production competition.
    Shanghai
    When the flames of the American imperialist war burned near the northeastern border of our country, the employees of the state-owned cotton textile industry in Shanghai launched a production competition to increase the spinning of 20-count cotton yarn to counter American imperialist aggression. The red line on the production record board of the State-owned Cotton No. 19 Factory rose from 0.541 pounds per ten hours of spindle spinning to 0.551 pounds, reaching a maximum of 0.562 pounds in one day, and the cumulative output exceeded the planned output by 24.56 pieces in six days. The production rate set the highest record since the opening of the factory. In addition, seven private yarn factories, including Huxi Hongzhang, also held production mobilization meetings and launched a production increase campaign following the state-owned yarn factories.
