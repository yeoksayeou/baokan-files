Residents of Meifang Alley and Other Alleys in West Shanghai
Accuse American Imperialism of Crimes

[Report from this newspaper] According to the Shanghai Wenhui Daily, residents of Meifang Alley and other alleys on Changshou Road in West Shanghai, filled with irrepressible anger, have held four consecutive current affairs symposiums since the evening of the 5th. They accused American imperialism of various persecutions and insults they suffered before liberation. At these meetings, old and young, men and women, factory workers, stallholders, shopkeepers, scavengers, and rickshaw pullers all vied to speak of their suffering. These accusations, mixed with blood and tears, made everyone present at the meeting unable to restrain their inner resentment.

　　Qi Pan, a car driver, said: "Once I saw with my own eyes in a bar on Nanjing Road, an American soldier drank wine and didn't pay. When the shop clerk asked him for money, he pulled out a bayonet and stabbed the clerk in the stomach. The clerk fell to the ground, and this American robber swaggered away. Not long after, he hugged a Chinese woman on the street and kissed her." Old Qi stood up angrily and said, "Damn it, American imperialism is simply a bunch of robbers."

　　Fan Hui said: "Once I saw with my own eyes an American jeep rushing wildly on Nanjing Road, instantly killing and injuring eight people; they treat the lives of Chinese people as less than a dog. American movies are full of vulgar thighs. I request the municipal government to ban these low and obscene American films."

　　Liu Zhenhua said: "One night in 1948, I saw with my own eyes a drunken American soldier stopping a couple who were walking together. He embraced the woman and punched the man to the ground. The woman's sharp cry brought a policeman, but the policeman could only stand there helplessly and say: 'I can't handle this, I'll have to call the 'military police'.' At this time, the female compatriot had already collapsed on the ground. This incident shows the bastards of American imperialism; now they are here to provoke again!" He raised his fist and slammed it heavily on the table, saying excitedly: "I have decided to join the volunteer army and drive American imperialism back!" Song Huicheng said: "I used to be a police officer in the New Urban Sub-bureau. I was in charge of the traffic lights across from the International Hotel. At that time, American soldiers rushed around recklessly. Every time I was on duty, I would encounter more than a dozen incidents caused by American soldiers. Once I interfered with a prostitute who was obstructing my work position, an American military police officer came over. He said I insulted his 'girlfriend', suddenly pushed me and came forward to snatch my pistol, which angered the surrounding masses, and everyone rushed up to beat him until his head was bleeding. Later, the American naval police arrested me and said I was a troublemaker. I explained that I was performing my duties, but he said: Americans are not bound by Chinese law; in the end, I was even given a reprimand by the puppet police bureau."

　　Finally, everyone unanimously expressed their determination to unite, resist America and aid Korea, cut off the invading claws of American imperialism, and asked the government to ban low and obscene American films so that they would no longer poison the minds of young people. In terms of regional work, we must do a good job in winter defense, strictly guard against special agents, and trace rumors to their source.

　　沪西梅芳里等里弄居民
　　控诉美帝罪行
    【本报讯】据上海文汇报讯：沪西长寿路梅芳里等里弄的居民，怀着不可遏止的愤怒，从五日晚起，连续举行了四次时事座谈会。控诉解放以前身受美帝的种种迫害与侮辱。在这些会上老的、少的、男的、女的、做厂的、摆摊头的、开店的、拾荒的、踏三轮车的，他们都争着诉苦。这些和着血与泪的控诉，使每个出席会议的人，都抑制不住内心的愤恨。
    开汽车的祁泮说：有一次我亲眼看见在南京路酒吧间，美国兵吃了酒不给钱，店里的职员问他要，他拔出刺刀来刺在这职员的肚子上。职员倒在地上，这美国强盗大摇大摆的走了。走不多时，他在路上又抱起中国妇女接吻。老祈说到这里气愤的站起来说：“他妈的，美帝简直是强盗。”
    范辉说：有一次我亲眼看到美军吉普车在南京路上横冲直撞，一下子撞死撞伤八个人；他们把中国人的命看得不如一条狗。美国的电影里都是些肉麻的大腿，我要求市政府取缔这些低级下流的美片。
    刘振华说：“在一九四八年的一个晚上，亲眼看见一个吃醉的美国兵，阻拦了一对正在散步的男女，他搂抱着那位女的，把男的一拳打在地上；女的尖锐叫声，找来一个警察，然而警察只好垂着手说：这事我没法管，还是打电话叫‘宪兵’来吧。这时那位女同胞已经不支躺在地上。这件事说明了美帝的浑蛋；这次他又来挑衅了！”他高举起拳头朝桌上重重的敲了一下，激昂地说：“我决定参加志愿军，把美帝打回去！”宋惠澄说：我过去在新成分局当警士，我担任国际饭店对面开红绿灯的职务，那时美国兵横冲直撞，每当一次差，就会碰到十几起美兵肇事事件。有一次我干涉一个妨碍我工作岗位的私娼，一个美国陆军宪兵走过来了，他说我侮辱他的“女朋友”，冷不防就推我一跤，并上前来夺我的手枪，惹得周围的群众都气愤填胸，大家一起拥上去把他打的头破血流；后来，美国海军宪兵抓了我去，说我行凶，我说明我是执行职务的，但他说：美国人是不受中国法律约束的；最后，我还受到伪警局的申诫处分。
    最后大家一致表示要团结起来，抗美援朝，割掉美帝的侵略魔手，并请政府取缔低级下流的美片，不让他再毒害青年思想。在地区工作方面，今后一定要办好冬防，严防特务，听到谣言要追根。
