　　Resolutely Resist America, Aid Korea, and Defend Our Homes and Country
    -- Letters from Readers Across the Country to This Newspaper
    We Guarantee to Quickly Repair Warships
    Extinguish the Flames of the American Imperialist Aggression War
    Editor Comrade:
    When all the workers of our Jiangnan Shipyard saw in the newspapers on October 30th that Foreign Minister Zhou had lodged a protest with the United Nations against the intrusion of American aircraft into our airspace, all the workers in the factory rose up to resolutely oppose American imperialist aggression, hate American imperialism, resolutely support Foreign Minister Zhou's protest, and decided to mobilize all the workers in the factory, raise production enthusiasm, do a good job in production competition, quickly repair warships, and ensure the completion of the two major tasks instructed by Chairman Mao. Every worker said that our national workers have unparalleled strength and are not afraid of American imperialist aggression. We will certainly not tolerate such crazy crimes from continuing. We must call on all of Shanghai's one million workers to raise the highest level of vigilance, take practical actions to improve production, and be prepared to crush the crazy aggression of American imperialism at any time.

    We have decided to stand on the side of defending world peace and fight to the end to extinguish the flames of the American imperialist aggression war.

    The American Imperialists Are Blind to Bully Us
    Let Them Taste the Iron Fists of the People
    Editor Comrade:
    The American devils are simply getting more and more crazy and barbaric. It is not enough for them to slaughter the Korean people, they are also burning the flames of war to the doorstep of our motherland. Korea is our neighbor, how can we not care about such brutal aggression against our neighbor? They still dream of making the Chinese people their slaves again, they are really blind. They must be made to taste the iron fists of the Chinese people, if they are not reconciled.
        Industrial Model Worker Li Jingmin
    If the American Imperialists Dare to Invade Our Motherland Again
    We Will Beat Them So They Can Come But Not Go Back
    Editor Comrade:
    After reading the news in the newspaper about the death of Comrade Ren Bishi, I was very saddened. This is a great loss to our country. He was one of the leaders of the Chinese Communist Party. In his thirty years of struggle, he defeated Japanese imperialism and defeated the Kuomintang reactionaries, and the working people were liberated and turned over. Unexpectedly, our benefactor passed away. We workers must take practical actions, turn grief into strength, step up our work, step up our propaganda, and oppose the aggressive atrocities of American imperialism. Many workers in our factory said: We are not afraid of American imperialism, if it comes, we will beat it so that it can come but not go back. A large-scale production movement has now been launched in our factory to accumulate funds and consolidate national defense. After I got home, I also publicized the crimes of the American imperialists to my neighbors. I firmly believe that the Chinese people have the strength to crush the aggressive behavior of the American imperialists.

    If the American Imperialists Dare to Set Foot on the Land of Our Motherland
    We Will Bury Them on This Land
    Editor Comrade:
    The American imperialists dare to brazenly and shamelessly repeatedly violate our People's Republic of China. They must know that the Chinese people are building their own motherland, but at the same time, they are always ready with their fists to give the aggressors a head-on blow. We are determined to contribute our sweat and blood to opposing the war of aggression and building a new China. If the American imperialists dare to set foot on our land, we will bury them on this land!

    We Must Not Only Defend the National Defense of Our Motherland
    But Also Actively Assist the Korean People
    Editor Comrade:
    We have been following the news about the American imperialists invading our Taiwan and our neighboring country Korea. Since the American imperialists launched a robber-style offensive against Korea, they have repeatedly violated our airspace and territorial waters, killing and wounding our people. This is a direct provocation to our country. We can no longer tolerate it!
    We are revolutionary soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and must defend our motherland. All patriotic people must also support the People's Liberation Army and resolutely resist the American imperialists who are invading our Taiwan and our friendly country Korea. We must not only defend the national defense of our motherland, but also take active voluntary actions to assist the Korean people, just as the Korean people helped our country liberate. The people of China and Korea have a relationship of interdependence and flesh and blood. The people of the two countries were oppressed nations in the East in the past. They have common enemies and common friends. Our goals are the same. We once fought side by side on the road to liberation. The Korean people shed blood for the liberation of the Chinese people.

    Today is the time for the people of the world to actively defend peace and stop aggression. In Asia, the Korean people have stood on the front line. If the lips are gone, the teeth will be cold. We must not ignore the Korean War! If your neighbor's house is on fire, can you watch without saving it? If a wolf comes down the mountain, can you watch it eat people? Absolutely not! We must eliminate all those who undermine peace and invade us.

　　坚决抗美援朝保家卫国
    ——本报各地读者来信
    我们保证迅速修好兵船
    扑灭美帝侵略战争火焰编辑同志：
    我们江南造船所全体工友在十月三十号看到各报都刊载着周外长为抗议美机侵犯我领空向联合国提出的控诉，全厂工友都起来坚决反对美帝侵略，仇视美帝国主义，坚决拥护周外长的抗议，决定保证发动全厂工友，提高生产积极性搞好生产竞赛，很快修好兵船，保证完成毛主席所指示的两大任务。每个工友都说我们全国工人力量强大无比，不怕美帝侵略战争。也决不能容忍这种疯狂的罪行再继续下去。我们一定号召全上海一百多万工友提起最高度的警惕，用实际行动搞好生产，准备随时粉碎美帝国主义的疯狂侵略。
    我们决定站在保卫世界和平的一边，共同为扑灭美帝侵略战争的火焰而奋斗到底。

    美帝欺负我们是瞎了眼
    让它尝尝人民的铁拳头编辑同志：
    美国鬼子简直越来越疯狂，越来越野蛮了。它屠杀朝鲜人民还不算，又将战火烧到我们的祖国门口。朝鲜是我们的邻邦，邻邦遭受了这样残暴的侵略，咱们怎能不管？它还梦想再叫中国人民当它的牛马，真是瞎了眼。非得让它尝尝中国人民的铁拳头，它不甘心。
        工业劳模  李景民
    美帝敢再来侵略我们祖国
    我们就打它个能来不能去编辑同志：
    从报纸上看到任弼时同志逝世的消息后，我非常悲痛。这是我们国家的一个很大损失。他是中国共产党领导者之一。他三十年的斗争中间，打败了日本帝国主义，打败了国民党反动派，劳动人民得到解放翻了身。不料想我们的恩人竟去世了。我们工人要拿出实际行动，化悲痛为力量，加紧工作，加紧宣传，反对美帝国主义的侵略暴行。我们厂内很多工友说：我们不怕美帝国主义，它要来，我们就打它个能来不能去。现在我们厂内已开展大生产运动，以积累资金，巩固国防。我回家后对街坊也宣传了美帝的罪行。我深信我们中国人民是有力量粉碎美帝的侵略行为的。
        工业劳模  桂文成
    美帝如敢踏上我祖国土地
    就叫它埋葬在这块土地上编辑同志：
    美帝竟敢卑鄙无耻地一再犯我中华人民共和国。要他知道，中国人民正在建设自己的祖国，但同时也随时准备着拳头，给侵略者迎头痛击。我们坚决为反对侵略战争，为建设新中国而贡献我们的汗和血。美帝敢踏上我们的土地，就叫他埋葬在这土地上！

    我们不仅要保卫祖国国防
    而且要积极援助朝鲜人民编辑同志：
    我们一直关心着美帝侵略我国台湾和我国邻邦朝鲜的消息。美帝对朝鲜发动强盗式的进攻以来，又连续犯我领空、领海，杀伤我国人民。这是向我国直接挑衅的行为。我们再也不能忍受下去了！
    我们是中国人民解放军的革命战士，一定要捍卫祖国。一切爱国的人民也要支援人民解放军，坚决抗击侵略我国台湾和友邦朝鲜的美国帝国主义。我们不仅要保卫祖国的国防，而且要像朝鲜人民帮助我国解放一样，采取积极的志愿的行动，援助朝鲜人民。中朝两国人民有唇齿相依、血肉相连的关系，两国人民过去同是东方受压迫的民族，有共同的敌人，也有共同的朋友；我们的目标是一致的，在解放的道路上，曾经并肩作战。朝鲜人民曾为中国人民的解放流出了鲜血。
    今天，是全世界人民积极保卫和平、制止侵略的时候，在亚洲，朝鲜人民已经站在了最前线。唇亡齿寒，朝鲜战争我们决不能置之不理！邻家房子着了火，能看着不救？恶狼下山，能看着它吃人？万万不能！一切破坏和平侵略我们的人，我们一定要消灭它。
