　　Voluntarily Go to Korea to Resist America and Defend Our Homeland
    Shenyang and Other Places Four Hundred Plus Drivers Have Automatically Formed a Motor Vehicle Brigade
    [Report from this newspaper] According to the Northeast Daily: In various mines in Northeast China including Shenyang, Anshan, Liaodong, Liaoxi, Jilin, Songjiang, and Lushun-Dalian, more than four hundred automobile drivers have volunteered to drive automobiles to Korea, transporting ammunition and supplies to the Korean People's Army, assisting the Korean people who are resisting American imperialist aggression, and protecting the motherland's border from threats. They have automatically formed a volunteer motor vehicle brigade. Zhang Fushou, a driver from Liaodong Province, which is close to Korea, believes that if we Chinese people do not assist Korea, after the American imperialists occupy Korea, they will do as the Japanese invaders did, and then invade Northeast China. Our hometowns will be the first to suffer. Therefore, he is determined to assist the Korean people and drive away the American imperialists. Regarding the bandit behavior of the American imperialists, the drivers are all shouting: We cannot tolerate it! In addition, automobile drivers in public and private transportation industries have also expressed their determination to resist America and aid Korea. All twenty-eight automobile drivers of the Keshan County Transportation Company in Heilongjiang Province have volunteered to go to Korea.

　　志愿赴朝抗美保卫家乡
    沈阳等地四百余司机已自动组成汽车大队
    【本报讯】据东北日报消息：东北沈阳、鞍山、辽东、辽西、吉林、松江、旅大等地区各矿场，已有四百余位汽车司机志愿驾驶汽车赴朝鲜，给朝鲜人民军运输弹药、给养，援助正在进行反抗美帝侵略的朝鲜人民，并保卫祖国边疆不受威胁。他们已自动组成了志愿汽车大队。紧靠朝鲜的辽东省汽车司机张福寿认为：我们中国人民如不去援助朝鲜，美帝占领了朝鲜后，就会象日寇做过的那样，接着就来侵略东北，首先受害的就是我们的家乡。因此，他坚决要去援助朝鲜人民，赶走美帝。对于美帝的强盗行为，司机们都这样喊着：我们不能容忍了！此外，公私营运输业的汽车司机，也纷纷表示志愿抗美援朝的决心。黑龙江省克山县运输公司的二十八名汽车司机，都志愿赴朝。
