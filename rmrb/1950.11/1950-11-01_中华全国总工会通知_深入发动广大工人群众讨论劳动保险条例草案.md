　　All-China Federation of Trade Unions Notice
    Deeply Mobilize the Broad Masses of Workers to Discuss the Draft Labor Insurance Regulations

    [Xinhua News Agency, October 31st] The All-China Federation of Trade Unions today issued a notice on mobilizing the broad masses of workers to discuss the Draft Labor Insurance Regulations of the People's Republic of China. The full text is as follows:

    To the National Committees of all Industrial Trade Unions, the General Trade Unions of all Major Administrative Areas (or the Offices of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions), and through them to all subordinate levels of trade union organizations:

    The Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government has promulgated the Draft Labor Insurance Regulations of the People's Republic of China to solicit opinions from relevant organs, groups, especially trade union organizations and the masses of workers. The promulgation and implementation of these regulations will be another great revolutionary achievement for our Chinese working class under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, following the promulgation of the Trade Union Law. At a time when the state's financial and economic situation has just begun to improve and has not yet fundamentally improved, the Central People's Government is doing its utmost to protect the health of the workers and staff and reduce the special difficulties and concerns in their lives. This shows how much our People's Government cares about the welfare of the working masses.

    The promulgation of these regulations is a major event in the history of the Chinese workers' movement, worthy of enthusiastic support and celebration by the working class nationwide. The leading organs of trade union organizations in all regions and industries should conduct detailed studies based on the Draft Labor Insurance Regulations promulgated in newspapers in various places on October 30th, especially to carry out extensive and in-depth publicity in grassroots trade union organizations in a planned way. A detailed discussion and explanation should be held in each trade union group so that every worker can understand the significance of these regulations, further enhance their labor enthusiasm, promote patriotism, and strive to consolidate national defense, oppose the aggression of American imperialism, and strive for a fundamental improvement in the state's financial and economic situation.

    Please write the discussion situation and opinions on the draft regulations into a written report and send it to the Labor Insurance Department of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions before the end of November.

              All-China Federation of Trade Unions
              October 31st

　　中华全国总工会通知
    深入发动广大工人群众讨论劳动保险条例草案
    【新华社三十一日讯】中华全国总工会今日发出关于发动广大工人群众讨论中华人民共和国劳动保险条例草案的通知。全文如下：
    各产业工会全国委员会、各大行政区总工会（或全国总工会办事处）、并转所属各级工会组织：
    中央人民政府政务院已将中华人民共和国劳动保险条例草案公布，征求有关机关团体，特别是工会组织及工人群众的意见。这个条例的公布与实行将是继工会法颁布后，我们中国工人阶级在中国共产党与毛主席英明领导下所获得的又一伟大的革命成果。当国家财政经济状况刚刚开始好转而尚未基本好转的时候，中央人民政府就尽最大可能来注意保护工人职员群众的健康，减轻其生活中的特殊困难与顾虑，这说明我们人民政府是如何关心工人群众的福利。
    这个条例的公布，是中国工人运动史上一件值得全国工人阶级热烈拥护与庆祝的大事。各地区与各产业工会组织的领导机关应根据十月三十日在各地报纸上公布的劳动保险条例草案，作详细研究，特别是要有计划地在工会基层组织中，进行广泛而深入的宣传，要在每个工会小组中都作一次详细的讨论和解释，使每个工人都能了解这个条例的意义，而更加提高劳动热情，发扬爱国主义，为巩固国防，反对美帝国主义的侵略并争取国家财政经济状况根本好转而斗争。
    请将讨论情况和对条例草案的意见，写成书面报告，于十一月底以前寄交中华全国总工会劳动保险部。
              中华全国总工会
              十月三十一日
