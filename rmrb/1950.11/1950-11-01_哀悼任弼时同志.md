　　In Mourning of Comrade Ren Bishi
　　Ye Jianying
　　Comrade Ren Bishi was one of the outstanding leaders of our Party. From the age of sixteen, he dedicated his life to the cause of China's national liberation, people's liberation, and the liberation of the working class, tirelessly and selflessly fighting against the enemy. For thirty years, Comrade Bishi experienced all kinds of arduous struggles and made great contributions to our Party's youth work, organizational work, army political work, and the victory of Mao Zedong Thought. However, Comrade Bishi was always diligent, hardworking, and single-mindedly devoted to the interests of the Party and the people. He never cared about fame or status. Regardless of whether people knew it or not, he consistently dedicated everything he had to the Party and the people for thirty years as if it were a single day. He was the camel of our Party, the camel of the Chinese people, bearing heavy burdens, walking long and arduous roads, without rest, without enjoyment, and without any personal considerations. He was an outstanding communist, the best member of our Party, and our model. Today, when the national revolution has achieved victory, and when Chairman Mao has repeatedly called on us to guard against arrogance and rashness and continue to maintain a humble and simple style, Comrade Bishi is even more a model for all our communist party members to learn from. If there are still some comrades who are obsessed with fame and status after the victory, and who are preoccupied with personal gains and losses, after seeing Comrade Bishi's truly selfless life of struggle for the cause of the Party and the people, they should earnestly learn from Comrade Ren Bishi and correct their mistakes.
　　Secondly, we should also learn from Comrade Bishi's firm and correct adherence to principles. In the summer of 1936, during the Long March, the Second and Fourth Front Armies of the Red Army met in western Sichuan. At that time, the leader of the Fourth Front Army, the traitor Zhang Guotao, was ambitious and used every means to prevent these two Front Armies from going to northern Shaanxi to meet with the Central Committee, attempting to establish his own faction, split the Party, split the Red Army, and betray the communist cause. However, Comrade Bishi, along with Comrade Zhu De and others, fought against the traitor Zhang Guotao, used the spirit of Bolshevism to educate the cadres, enabled the broad masses of cadres to recognize the errors of the traitor Zhang Guotao, opposed the traitor Zhang Guotao's divisive activities, and finally completed the Long March to northern Shaanxi, meeting with the Central Red Army, preserving the strength of the Red Army and preserving the material basis for the War of Resistance Against Japan. Comrade Bishi's firm adherence to principles and patient persuasive educational attitude in this struggle are forever worthy of our learning.
　　During the People's Liberation War, in the spring of 1947, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang concentrated its forces to launch key offensives against Shandong and northern Shaanxi, occupied Yan'an, and carried out destructive offensives in northern Shaanxi. During this period, Comrade Mao Zedong remained in northern Shaanxi, on the one hand, to persist in the struggle with the people of northern Shaanxi, and on the other hand, to direct the military and other work throughout the country. During this period, Comrade Bishi, along with Comrades Enlai and Peng Dehuai, assisted Chairman Mao in directing the work of the whole country, formulating various policies, turning to a large-scale counter-offensive, and laying the foundation for the establishment of the People's Republic of China. Few people know about Comrade Bishi's great contribution. It was precisely because Comrade Bishi worked excessively during these years that his health deteriorated day by day, eventually leading to his eternal departure from us.
　　Comrade Bishi: Please rest in peace. We must shoulder the tasks you have not completed, so that our Party will become more sound and stronger under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought. We must oppose American imperialism to the end and defend the independence of the People's Republic of China. We must learn from your spirit of hard work and simplicity, save the country's resources, and build our great People's Republic!

　　哀悼任弼时同志
    叶剑英
    任弼时同志是我党杰出的领导人之一。从十六岁起，他就把他的一生贡献给了中国的民族解放、人民解放和工人阶级的解放事业，不知疲倦地和忘我地和敌人进行战斗。三十年来，弼时同志经历了各种艰苦的斗争，对我党的青年工作、组织工作、军队政治工作与毛泽东思想的胜利，作了伟大的贡献。但是，弼时同志却终身都是勤勤恳恳，埋头苦干，一心只有党和人民的利益，从不计较什么名誉地位，不管人家知道不知道，他总是三十年如一日地为党为人民贡献出他的一切。他是我们党的骆驼，中国人民的骆驼，担负着沉重的担子，走着漫长的艰苦的道路，没有休息，没有享受，没有个人的任何计较。他是杰出的共产主义者，是我们党最好的党员，是我们的模范。在全国革命取得胜利的今天，在毛主席屡次号召我们要戒骄戒躁，继续保持谦虚朴素的作风的今天，弼时同志更是我们全体共产党员学习的模范。若还有些在胜利后闹名誉地位，斤斤于个人得失的同志，看了弼时同志真正忘我地为党为人民的事业而奋斗的一生，更应当好好地向任弼时同志学习，改正自己的错误。
    其次，我们还应该学习弼时同志的坚定的正确的原则精神。一九三六年夏，红军二、四两方面军长征中在西康境内会合，那时四方面军的领导人叛徒张国焘野心勃勃，用一切方法阻碍这两个方面军到陕北去与中央会合，企图别树一帜分裂党、分裂红军，叛变共产主义事业，但是，弼时同志和朱德同志等进行了反对叛徒张国焘的斗争，用布尔什维克的原则精神，来教育了干部，使得广大的干部认识了叛徒张国焘的错误，反对了叛徒张国焘的分裂活动，终于长征到陕北，与中央红军会合，保存了红军的力量，保存了抗日战争的物质基础，弼时同志在这次斗争中坚定的原则精神，耐心的说服教育态度，是永远值得我们学习的。
    在人民解放战争时期，一九四七年春，蒋介石匪帮集中力量向山东和陕北两地进行重点进攻，侵占了延安，在陕北作毁灭性的进攻，这期间，毛泽东同志留在陕北，一面和陕北人民坚持斗争，一面指挥全国的军事和各方面的工作，在这个时期，弼时同志和恩来同志、彭德怀同志在毛主席的旁边，襄助毛主席指挥全国的工作，制定各种政策，转入大反攻，奠定了中华人民共和国产生的基础，弼时同志这一伟大的功绩知道的人是很少的。正因为弼时同志这几年工作过度，身体一天天地坏下来，终至与我们永别了。
    弼时同志：请安息吧，我们一定要担负起你未完成的任务，使我们的党在毛泽东思想的指导下更加健全和壮大起来，我们一定要反对美国帝国主义到底，保卫中华人民共和国的独立；我们一定要学习你艰苦朴素的作风，节约国家的资财，来建设我们伟大的人民共和国！
