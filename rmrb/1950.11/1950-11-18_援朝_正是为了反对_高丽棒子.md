　　"Aiding Korea" Is Precisely to Oppose the "Goryeo Bangzi"
    Question: I have a point of view on the Resist America, Aid Korea movement. I believe resisting America is necessary because it is invading us. However, I do not support "aiding Korea." Because, during the Japanese imperialist invasion of our country, many Koreans in China, along with the Japanese, bullied the Chinese people. People called them "Goryeo Bangzi" and hated them as much as they hated the Japanese. Now that the Americans are attacking them, wouldn't it be good to let them also receive a lesson? Why should we help them instead?
    Reader Wang Kun
    Answer: The "Goryeo Bangzi" you mentioned from the time of the Japanese invasion of China, in terms of their class composition, are now that group of Korean reactionaries headed by Syngman Rhee. This is like China having the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. This group of Korean reactionaries, in the past, acted as lackeys of Japanese imperialism, oppressing the Korean people in Korea and committing outrages in China. After the surrender of Japanese imperialism, they became lackeys of American imperialism, helping American imperialists oppress the Korean people and plotting to invade our country. They are enemies of the Korean people and also enemies of the Chinese people.
    The Syngman Rhee gang is extremely brutal to the Korean people. After August 15th, the Syngman Rhee gang, with the support of American imperialism, massacred hundreds of thousands of Korean people in South Korea. On Jeju Island, a small island with a population of just over 200,000, they killed more than 30,000 people and destroyed 200 villages. On June 25th of this year, the Syngman Rhee gang, under the direct command of American imperialism, launched a large-scale offensive against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, provoking a full-scale Korean civil war. American imperialism quickly and openly came forward to directly engage in a war of aggression. The main purpose of American imperialism and its stooge Syngman Rhee in attacking the Korean people is to attack China. A powerful proof of this can be found in the so-called "ROK-U.S. Mutual Defense Treaty" draft that Yoon Byung-koo, an advisor to the Syngman Rhee puppet government's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, sent to Syngman Rhee. Article 7 of the treaty states: "The President of the Republic of Korea, in addition to restoring North Korea where the main interests of the Republic of Korea lie, guarantees to transfer the development of natural resources in Manchuria and other parts of Northeast China to the joint management of the United States and Korea."
    However, the Korean people, represented by General Kim Il-sung, have always been friends of the Chinese people. Many Korean revolutionaries have always participated in China's revolutionary movement, helping the Chinese people in their struggle for liberation. Their blood, like that of Chinese revolutionaries, has been spilled on Chinese soil. This is an act of chivalry that is very worthy of gratitude from the Chinese people. Now, they are standing on the front lines of the world's peace and democracy camp, bravely resisting the aggression of American imperialism. They are making beneficial contributions to the cause of peace in the world and in China. Therefore, it is entirely necessary for the Chinese people to aid the Korean people, precisely to smash the aggressive actions against the Chinese and Korean people by the common enemy of the two peoples—American imperialism and its stooge in Korea—the "Goryeo Bangzi" headed by Syngman Rhee.

### “援朝”正是为了反对“高丽棒子”

　　“援朝”正是为了反对“高丽棒子”
    问：我对抗美援朝运动有一点意见。我认为抗美是必须的，因为它侵略我们。但是，我不赞成“援朝”。因为，在日本帝国主义侵略我国的时候，在中国，有很多朝鲜人和日本人一起，欺侮中国人民，人们都叫他们为“高丽棒子”，像恨日寇一样地恨他们。美国人现在打他们，不正好让他们也受一次教训么？为什么反而要援助他们呢？
    读者  王昆
    答：你所说的日本侵华时期的“高丽棒子”，就其阶级成份来说，在现在，就是以李承晚为首的那一群朝鲜反动派。这等于中国之有蒋介石匪帮一样。这一批朝鲜反动派，在过去，充当日本帝国主义的走狗，在朝鲜则压迫朝鲜人民，在中国亦为非作歹。日本帝国主义投降后，他们又变为美帝国主义的走狗，帮助美帝国主义者压迫朝鲜人民，并阴谋向我国侵略。他们是朝鲜人民的敌人，同样也是中国人民的敌人。
    李承晚匪帮对朝鲜人民是十分残暴的。“八、一五”后，李承晚匪帮在美帝国主义支持下曾在南朝鲜先后屠杀数十万朝鲜人民。在济州岛，这样一个不过二十万人口的小岛上，就杀死过三万多人；毁灭了二百个村庄。今年六月二十五日，李承晚匪帮在美帝国主义直接指挥下，向朝鲜民主主义人民共和国发动了大规模的进攻，挑起了朝鲜全面的内战。美帝国主义很快即公开出马，直接进行侵略战争。美帝国主义及其走狗李承晚进攻朝鲜人民的最主要目的是进攻中国。只要看一看李承晚傀儡政府外务部顾问尹炳求寄给李承晚的所谓“韩美同盟条约”草案，就可以得到一个有力的证明。该条约第七条写道：“大韩民国总统除了复兴大韩民国主要利益所在的北朝鲜以外，保证将满洲和中国东北部其他部分的天然资源的发展移交美国和韩国联合管理。”
    但是，以金日成将军为代表的朝鲜人民，却从来就是中国人民的朋友。许多朝鲜革命者历来都参加中国的革命运动，帮助中国人民进行解放斗争。他们的鲜血，和中国革命者一样，流洒在中国的土地上。这是十分值得中国人民感谢的侠义行为。现在，他们又站在世界和平民主阵营的前线，英勇地抵抗美帝国主义的侵略，他们对世界和中国的和平事业正作着有益的贡献。因此，中国人民援助朝鲜人民，是完全必要的，这正是为了粉碎中朝两国人民的共同敌人——美帝国主义及其在朝鲜的走狗——以李承晚为首的“高丽棒子”对中朝两国人民的侵略行为。
