Editorial: How to Lead Rectification in District and Township Organizations

At a time when the rectification movement is penetrating the grassroots, strengthening the leadership of rectification in district and township (village) organizations is extremely important. This is not only because district and township (village) organizations are the organizations that directly implement various policies and directly connect with the broad masses, and the work and ideological style of these organizations and cadres are closely related to the vital interests of the masses; but also because whether the various methods and systems for improving work stipulated by the leading organs above the county level after rectification are practical must be investigated in depth at the grassroots level and on the spot before a judgment can be made. In the process of inspection and summary work by leading organs and cadres above the county level, some problems may not have been discovered, or the understanding of problems may not be profound enough due to insufficient specific materials. These all need to be resolved by going deep into grassroots organizations and continuing to lead rectification.

Checking the work of district and township (village) organizations and cadres should be the same as at the county level and above, that is, the check should be carried out through the main work. However, district and township (village) cadres, due to their lower level, are not good at analyzing situations and summarizing experiences, and may likely regard the check work as settling old scores or turning it into piecemeal individual checks. This requires the leading cadres at the higher level to make enlightening reports and guide the district and township (village) cadres to find ways to check the main work. In the district and township (village) check work, the main focus should be on checking the commandist style existing among district and township (village) cadres. However, leaders above the county level also bear important responsibility for this issue. In the past, generally speaking, leaders above the county level assigned tasks to lower levels more often than providing concrete help. And individual leading cadres have also adopted a commandist approach towards lower-level cadres and the masses. For example, when leading cadres in Jiyuan County assigned tasks to lower levels, they said: "The task must be completed within one month, not a day more, not a bit less. If it is not completed, the district head and district secretary will be responsible." There are quite a few examples like this. Therefore, before checking the commandist mistakes of district and township (village) cadres, it is very necessary for leading cadres above the county level to make profound self-criticism to lower-level cadres. It can help to expand criticism and self-criticism between superiors and subordinates and deeply check the work of districts and townships (villages).

The enlightening report of leading cadres above the county level to district and township (village) cadres must first have a high degree of self-criticism, because the leadership has the clearest and most comprehensive understanding of the main problems existing in the work of the entire county, and must also bear the main responsibility. Therefore, only by bravely shouldering the responsibilities that they should bear can district and township (village) cadres be convinced, determine right and wrong, and distinguish responsibilities. Secondly, the correct parts of the work of district and township (village) cadres, that is, the tasks that have been completed and some correct methods and experiences in completing the tasks, should be affirmed and encouraged, and should never be denied. Only in this way can all cadres happily accept, thus deeply examine their work, recognize the correct and wrong parts of their work, and formulate plans for improving their work in the future.

When criticizing the commandist style and other tendencies to deviate from the masses shown by district and township (village) cadres in completing tasks, one should not simply "severely criticize" and be done with it, so as not to cause some cadres to have the negative idea of "rather not complete the task." More importantly, we should strengthen the education of district and township (village) cadres on the mass line, so that every cadre recognizes that the mass line is the Party's line, the class line, the revolutionary line, and the fundamental method of revolutionary work; violating the mass line is violating the interests of the Party, the interests of the class, the interests of the revolution, the interests of the people, and the fundamental method of revolutionary work. This is what Comrade Mao Zedong instructed: "Serve the Chinese people wholeheartedly, and never deviate from the masses for a moment; proceed from the interests of the people, not from the interests of one's own small group or one's own individual." "All words and actions of Communists should be judged by whether they conform to the greatest interests of the broadest masses of the people and whether they are supported by the broadest masses of the people as the highest standard." In addition to providing theoretical explanations of these principles, specific education must be carried out, that is, every cadre must recognize from their own personal experience that the mass line is the fundamental method of all work. Any work that follows the mass line will succeed, and any work that adopts methods that violate this will definitely fail.

Some areas have now achieved success by adopting the method of comparing typical facts on the contrary, starting from their own personal experiences, in accordance with the degree accepted by general lower-level cadres, to carry out mass line education. For example, the Songjiang Prefectural Committee of Southern Jiangsu took the pest control work in the main work as the center and listed four different working methods for comparison, so that each cadre clearly recognized from these specific examples that the mass line is the fundamental method of all work, and those who adopt this method will succeed, otherwise they will definitely fail. This kind of comparison can have a good effect on district and township (village) cadres because it conforms to the ideological laws of general cadres. When commandism is criticized, a kind of thought often arises, thinking that "coercive command is not good, but there is no other good way," "other methods cannot complete the task," and so on. At this time, there is an urgent need for correct working methods to replace the wrong working methods. Therefore, we should seize some typical examples and experiences to carry out mass line education in order to most effectively overcome the ideological style of commandism.

The rectification of district and township (village) cadres is very important, and this is the final key to determining the success or failure of the entire Party's rectification movement. At present, the time is very short, so we must grasp the leadership. Some areas have stipulated that the prefectural committee personally takes charge of leading the rectification of district-level cadres, and the county committee directly takes charge of leading the township (village) level, and the provincial committee should often send people to participate. These are all necessary. On the other hand, we should also pay attention to attracting the broad masses to help check the work of districts and townships (villages). Solicit opinions from the masses on the work of districts and townships (villages) and the style of cadres through people's representative meetings, peasant representative meetings and other various meetings. This method has been proven effective and should be adopted more by all regions so that the rectification movement in districts and townships can achieve good results.

### 怎样领导区乡组织的整风

　　怎样领导区乡组织的整风
    在目前整风运动深入下层的时候，加强对区乡（村）组织的整风领导极为重要。这不但是因为区乡（村）组织是直接执行各种政策和直接联系广大群众的组织，这些组织和干部的工作及思想作风，与群众切身利害关系极为密切；而且因为县以上领导机关经过整风所规定的各种改进工作的办法和制度是否切合实际，还要深入下层、深入现地去考察才能断定。在县以上领导机关和干部检查与总结工作中，还可能对有些问题没有发现；或因具体材料不够而认识问题还不深刻。这些都需要在深入下层组织，继续领导整风中去解决。
    检查区乡（村）组织和干部的工作，应该与县以上相同，即通过主要的工作来进行检查。但是区乡（村）干部由于水平较低，不善于分析情况，总结经验，很可能把检查工作当成算旧账，或者变成零碎的个人检查。这就需要上级领导干部作启发报告，引导区乡（村）干部找到检查主要工作的门路。在区乡（村）检查工作中，主要应检查区乡（村）干部中存在的命令主义作风。但在这个问题上，县以上的领导也要负重要的责任。过去县以上的领导，一般地说，是对下级布置任务多，具体帮助少。并且个别的领导干部对下级和群众也曾采取了命令主义方式。如济源县领导干部给下级分配任务时说道：“在一个月内要完成任务，时间一天不多，任务一点不少，完不成由区长区书负责。”这样例子还很不少。因此，在检查区乡（村）干部命令主义的错误之前，县以上领导干部，向下级干部进行深刻的自我检讨是非常必要的。它可以帮助上下之间批评与自我批评的展开，深入地检查区乡（村）工作。
    县以上领导干部对于区乡（村）干部的启发报告，首先要有高度的自我批评精神，这是因为领导上对全县工作中存在的主要问题，了解得最清楚、最全面，也是要负主要责任的。因此，勇敢地担负起自己应负的责任，才能使区乡（村）干部心悦诚服，确定是非，分清责任。其次，对于区乡（村）干部工作中正确的部分，即已经完成的任务和完成任务中一些正确的方法、经验，应予以肯定与鼓励，决不应否定一切。只有这样，才能使全体干部愉快地接受，因而深入地检查工作，认识自己工作中的正确部分和错误部分，并制定今后改进工作的计划。
    在批判区乡（村）干部在完成任务时所表现的命令主义作风和其他脱离群众的倾向的时候，不应该仅仅采取“严厉批评”了事，以致使一部分干部产生了“宁可不完成任务”的消极思想。更重要的是应该加强对区乡（村）干部的群众路线的教育，使每个干部认识到群众路线是党的路线，阶级的路线，革命的路线，是革命工作的根本方法；违背了群众路线就是违背了党的利益，阶级的利益，革命的利益，人民的利益和革命工作的根本方法。这就是毛泽东同志所指示的：“全心全意地为中国人民服务，一刻也不脱离群众；一切从人民利益出发，而不是从自己小集团或自己个人利益出发。”“共产党人的一切言论、行动，以是否合乎最广大人民群众的最大利益，是否为最广大人民群众所拥护为最高标准。”这些道理，除了给予理论上的说明外，必须进行具体的教育，就是要使每个干部，从自己亲身经验中认识群众路线是一切工作的根本方法。任何工作走了群众路线就能成功，任何工作采用了与此相违背的方法就一定失败。
    现在已有某些地区按照一般下级干部接受的程度，从他们切身的经验出发，采用以相反的典型事实作比较的方法，来进行群众路线的教育而得到了成功。例如苏南松江地委以主要工作中的治虫工作为中心，列举了四种不同的工作方法加以比较，使每个干部从这些具体事例中明确认识了群众路线是一切工作的根本方法，采用这种方法的就能成功，否则就一定失败。这种对比，对于区乡（村）干部所以能够发生好的效果，是因为它符合于一般干部的思想规律。当着命令主义被批判之后，往往会产生一种思想，认为“强迫命令不好，可是没有别的好办法”，“别的办法不能完成任务”等等。这时候，急需有正确的工作方法来代替错误的工作方法。因此，应抓紧一些典型事例和经验来进行群众路线的教育，才能最有效地克服命令主义的思想作风。
    区乡（村）干部的整风是非常重要的，这是决定全党整风运动成败的最后关键。目前时间十分短促，因此必须抓紧领导。有些地区规定了地委亲自掌握领导区级干部的整风，乡（村）级由县委直接掌握领导，省委应当经常派人参加。这都是必要的。另一方面，我们还应该注意吸引广大群众来帮助区乡（村）的工作检查。通过人民代表会议、农民代表会及其他各种会议，征求群众对区乡（村）工作和干部作风的意见，这种办法已被证明有效，各地应更多地采用，使区乡的整风运动获得良好的成绩。
