Xinhua News Agency, Tenth Dispatch: According to a TASS dispatch from New York on the 9th: The US State Department has refused to issue passports to prominent American writer Howard Fast and others to attend the Second World Peace Congress in England. The New York Herald Tribune's Washington correspondent reported that the State Department refused to comment further on the matter and would not announce the names of other individuals who were denied passports, with the exception of Fast.

Fast issued a statement to the press protesting, saying: The only reason the State Department refused to issue a passport is because I am going abroad to call for the struggle for peace. The State Department's excuse of "violating American interests" is actually a despicable and shameless sophistry. My going abroad may violate the interests of DuPont or any other merchants of death; it may violate the interests of Truman and Acheson's foreign policy, but it will never violate the highest interests of the country. Today, there is no better way to express loyalty to the United States than to fight for peace. Today, the entire United States is a prison, and the salvation of the United States depends entirely on peace.

    抗议美政府拒发出国护照阻挠出席二届和大
    【新华社十日讯】据塔斯社纽约九日讯：美国国务院已拒发出国护照给美国名作家法斯特等人前往英国出席第二届世界保卫和平大会。纽约先驱论坛报驻华盛顿记者报道称，国务院拒绝进一步谈论此事，且除法斯特一人外也不宣布其他未获出国护照的人的姓名。
    法斯特向报界发表声明表示抗议称：国务院拒绝发给护照的唯一理由，就是因为我要到国外去呼吁为和平而斗争。国务院所谓“违背美国利益”的借口，实际上是卑鄙无耻的诡辩。我的出国可能违背杜邦或任何其他死亡贩子的利益，可能违背杜鲁门和艾奇逊的外交政策的利益，但绝不违背国家的最高利益。今天除了为和平而斗争以外，没有其他办法更能表示对美国的忠诚了。今天整个美国就是一个监狱，美国的获救，完全有赖于和平。
