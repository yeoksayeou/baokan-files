American Vignettes
Professor of Chemistry Department, Normal University Hu Zhibin

    Mike and Bill

    Mike (half a namesake of MacArthur) was a geography graduate student who shared a room with me. Subject to the abhorrent capitalist education, he often showed the "superiority" of the white race. He fantasized about getting into the US State Department and becoming a representative of American world domination. Just after our Liberation War achieved a decisive and great victory in the Huaihai area, I said to him, "From now on, the Chinese people will soon gain peace!" He retorted, "What kind of peace is that? It's the Communist Party's peace." I said, "No matter whose peace it is, the Chinese people need peace." At this point, he paused and suddenly asked, "Then, what about the security of the United States?" I angrily retorted, "Are you saying that for the sake of your American security, the Chinese should kill the Chinese?" He said even more rudely, "I think you must be a Communist, because I often notice that you are happy whenever you see a Communist victory. In that case, I must report you to the Immigration Bureau and kick you out." When I heard his utterly secret agent tone, I said even more angrily, "That's great! I will leave here with great pride, because that would be a great irony for your American democracy!"

    Bill was a very progressive American student, and he was always concerned about China's affairs. I often told him about the corruption of the Chiang Kai-shek regime and the character of the Chinese people. He admired the Chinese people's generosity and their spirit of sacrificing themselves for the country and for their friends. Sometimes he would even introduce me to some other progressive friends. One day, in the hallway of the dormitory, when we were talking about the situation in China, he looked around and then whispered to remind me: "Hu, you know you are a foreigner, you must be careful when you speak!" When he mentioned the Chinese Communist Party, he always used the term "the North" to replace it.

    From these two personal contacts, we can understand that the United States is a country ruled by secret agents. Chen Lifu's "thug politics" and the United States are of the same ilk.

    People Without Political Minds

    Generally, Americans are dominated by capitalist culture and education and are indifferent to politics. Smith's (the most common American surname) interests are beer, women, and money. The headlines of American newspapers are usually robberies, murders, and car crashes. Readers look for comic strips and new car company advertisements at the end of the newspaper. Once I said to Jack, "Look at your newspapers, is your society really that bad?" He said, "Don't believe the newspapers!" The notorious "Chicago Tribune" even reported Truman's election as "Dewey Defeats Truman!" Newspapers like that can hardly teach people to believe, and their role is nothing more than to stimulate the numbed readers with low-level tastes and strengthen the rule of the capitalists!

    At a small symposium, some Americans wanted me to talk about China. I once said that the terrible exploitation and concentration of Chinese bureaucratic capital had harmed so many people, making the common people live a hellish life without clothes or food. China can only solve these problems by embarking on the path of New Democracy. These few words reminded them of Roosevelt's "New Deal," and they actually regarded Roosevelt's "New Deal" as "socialism." They said, "Before and after 1930, the situation in the United States was also very serious, and Roosevelt's 'New Deal' saved the situation." "But," I said, "why do many Americans dislike socialism?" Emmon (who had talked to me about this issue and was also present) defended, "We don't like this term. We can even abandon the 'ism' for the sake of a 'term'." This shows how pitiful some Americans are in terms of political minds!

    Treating Science as Magic

    We should admit that there are many conscientious people among the top scientists in the United States, but there are too few! Most "scientists" more or less follow the will of the capitalists. If you walk into a laboratory, a busy experimenter will often proudly point to something and tell you, "This is my little gadget." Their writings are limited to gadgets, and they often lack ideological content and philosophical foundation.

    Let me give an example! Kerwin of California once published several articles in "Science" on the study of photosynthesis using radioactive carbon. He took some beautiful photos (the capital for showing off) and formulated the process of changes in photosynthesis. He became famous overnight and was invited to give speeches everywhere. However, in his conclusions, he himself did not dare to fully believe in his proposed changes in photosynthesis. Someone once pointed out a premise that he had overlooked, and the person who reported on his behalf stared blankly, unable to answer!

    They regard science as "magic." Therefore, they fantasize that the world will be frightened by their "scientific" magic and submit! Many military leaders use articles and speeches to fight for their respective departments' budgets to raise a large number of "scientists." They vainly hope to obtain magical miracles through this, and secretly store them in their files, in order to satisfy their subjective and selfish desires.

    The Plundering Route of American Capitalists

    Now let us recall a specific fact in the last World War to see the route of capitalists' plunder and exploitation. As the "State Journal" of Madison, Wisconsin, revealed, "Washington has become a trough for industrial combinations" (the title of a Sunday editorial published by the newspaper). Just as the war was going on, monopoly capitalists instigated their kept Congressmen to pass a bill to grant loans to Iraq. The condition of exchange was that Iraq must cede the right to the United States to exploit oil (crude oil). After the bill was passed, the monopoly capitalists again launched their kept newspapers, saying that oil must be exploited and refined by private enterprises in order to avoid the danger of government control and preserve the American tradition of "freedom." After the oil is refined into gasoline, it is then underwritten by the government. In this way, in and out, the blood and sweat of the American and Iraqi people became profits that entered the pockets of the capitalists!

    美国见闻拾零
    师大化学系教授  胡志彬
    麦克和比耳
    麦克（和麦克阿瑟同半个姓）是和我同房住的一个学地理的研究生。他受着可恶的资本主义教育经常表现出白种人的“优越感”。他幻想着钻进美国国务院做一个美国统治世界的代表。正当我国解放战争在淮海一带取得一个决定性的伟大胜利之后，我对他说：“从此，中国人民就会很快地获得和平了！”他反诘我：“那是什么和平？是共产党的和平。”我说：“不管是谁的和平，中国人民需要和平。”这时他顿一会突然地问：“那末，美国的安全呢？”我气愤地反问他：“你是不是说，为了你们美国的安全，让中国人去杀中国人呢？”他更粗暴地说：“我看你一定是一个共产党，因为我常常注意你一看见共产党的胜利你就高兴。那末，我一定要报告移民局把你撵出去。”我一听到他那十足特务的口气，就更恼怒地说：“那好极了！我将很骄傲地离开这儿，因为那样对于你们美国的民主是很大的讽刺！”
    比耳是一个很进步的美国学生，他经常关心着中国的事。我常常告诉他一些蒋介石政权腐败的情形和中国人民的性格。他很钦佩中国人民的慷慨和为国家为朋友舍生取义的精神。有时候他还介绍一些别的进步朋友给我。有一天，在宿舍的走道上，谈起中国局势的时候，他左顾右盼，然后细声地提醒我：“胡，你知道你是一个外国人，说话要小心些！”当他提到中国共产党的时候，他总是用“北边”一词来代替。
    从这两点个人的接触，我们就可以体会得出：美国是一个特务统治着的国家。陈立夫的“打手政治”和美国是一个派系的。
    没有政治脑筋的人
    一般美国人受着资本主义文化和教育的支配，对于政治漠不关心。斯密士（美国最多的姓）的兴趣是啤酒、女人和金钱。美国报纸的头条新闻通常是抢劫、杀人和撞车。读报的人却在报尾巴上寻找连环漫画汽车公司的新广告。有一次我对夹克说：“看看你们的报纸，你们的社会是那样的糟糕吗？”他说：“别相信报纸吧！”臭名远扬的“芝加哥民意报”竟将杜鲁门的当选报导成“杜威击败杜鲁门！”这样的报纸那里会教人相信，其作用无非予麻木了的读者以低级趣味的刺激而加强资本家的统治罢了！
    在一个小型座谈会上，几个美国人要我谈一谈中国的事。我曾经表示：中国官僚资本可怕的剥削和集中不知伤害了多少人民，使得老百姓无衣无食过着地狱似的生活。中国惟有走上新民主主义的道路才能解决这些问题。这几句话提醒了他们，使他们怀念起罗斯福的“新政”，他们竟把罗斯福的“新政”看作“社会主义”。他们说：“一九三○年前后，美国的情形也很严重，罗斯福的‘新政’挽回了局面。”“但是，”我说：“为什么许多美国人不喜欢社会主义呢？”爱蒙（正是和我谈过这问题的，当时也在场）辩白说：“我们不喜欢这个名词。为了一个‘名词’连‘主义’都可以不要。这就说明了有些美国人政治脑筋之可怜了！
    把科学看成魔术
    我们应该承认美国第一流科学家中不乏有良心的人，但是为数太少了！一般的“科学家”都是或多或少遵循着资本家的意旨而行事。假如你走进一个实验室，一个正在忙碌的实验者往往很骄傲地指着一件东西告诉你：“这就是我的小玩意。”他们的著作尽为小玩意所限制，往往非常缺乏思想内容和哲学基础。
    举一个例吧！加尼福尼亚的克尔文曾经在“科学”上连续发表了好几篇关于用放射性碳素研究光合作用的文章。他照了几张漂亮的照片（炫耀的本钱）并拟出了光合作用的变化过程。于是一举成名，到处请他演讲。但是，在他的结论里，他自己也不敢太相信他所拟的光合作用的变化。有人曾经指出了其中的一个前提性而是为他所忽略了的问题，代他报告的人却在那里瞠目作呆，无可置答了！
    他们把科学看成“魔术”。因此，他们幻想着世界将为他们的“科学”魔术所吓唬倒而俯首就范！不少的军人首领们用文章和演说争取各自部门的预算来豢养大批的“科学家”。他们妄想借此取得魔术似的奇迹，密放在他们档案里，以备满足他们主观而自私的愿望。
    美国资本家的掠夺路线
    现在让我们回忆一下上次大战中的一个具体事实，看看资本家们的搜括和榨取的路线。正如美国麦迪逊城的“州会时报”所揭发的，“华盛顿成了产业组合的猪槽”（该报发表的一篇星期专论的标题）。正当大战进行之际，独占资本家们鼓动他们御用的国会议员们通过一项贷款给予伊拉克的法案。交换条件是伊拉克必须让予美国开采石油（原油）权。这项法案通过之后，垄断资本家们再发动他们的御用报纸，说是石油必须给私人企业开采和提炼，以免政府统制的危险而保存美国“自由”的传统。石油炼成汽油之后再由政府包销。这样一进一出，美国人民和伊拉克人民的血汗便变成了利润进入了资本家们的荷包里！
