Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 7th: People from all walks of life in the Central South region have unanimously expressed their firm support for the joint declaration of China's democratic parties and their intention to resist America and aid Korea and defend their homes and country through voluntary action.

Local organizations of democratic parties and people's organizations in Wuhan City and Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Guangxi provinces have successively issued statements supporting the joint declaration of the democratic parties on November 4th. The joint statement of the democratic parties in Wuhan City stated: We, the Chinese people, must mobilize in unity, accelerate the completion of all construction work to resist the aggression of American imperialism, and intensify our assistance to the Korean people's war of liberation, so that American imperialism will receive the same punishment as German, Japanese, and Italian fascists in the face of the Chinese people and the people of the world. The joint statement of the democratic parties in Hunan Province stated: We fully support the declaration of the central committees of China's democratic parties on the 4th of this month, and we must resolutely strive for resisting America, aiding Korea, and defending our homes and country with practical action. The preparatory committee of the Hubei Provincial Federation of Trade Unions and the Henan Provincial Federation of Trade Unions have issued statements calling on workers in their respective provinces to vigorously launch production competitions, accumulate strength, and enrich national defense. The federations of trade unions in Jiangxi Province and Nanchang City also represented workers throughout the province and city, respectively, stating their determination to voluntarily dedicate all their strength to fight to the end for the sacred task of resisting America, aiding Korea, and defending their homes and country. Farmers, youth, students, women, cultural and educational groups, and commanders and fighters in the armed forces in various provinces and cities have expressed their determination to support the Korean people's war against American aggression. The Education Trade Union and the Student Union of Henan University stated: American imperialism has invaded our neighbor Korea, setting our neighbor on fire, and we cannot sit idly by. All commanders and fighters of the Jiangxi Military Region are grinding their fists and gnashing their teeth in anger at the crazy aggressive actions of American imperialism.

At a current affairs symposium held by the Hankou Changjiang Daily, participants described the firm will of the city's people to fight against American aggression with a common hatred. Zhou Dehui, an old teacher at the Municipal No. 2 Girls' Middle School, said that in order to support the Korean people, he was willing to send several of his children to the front lines in Korea. Bao Jiqun, a female teacher at the school, requested to go to Korea to join the army as a nurse. Yu Huashan, director of the Labor Township Farmers' Association in the suburbs of the city, who was invited to attend the symposium, said: In order to resist the American aggressors, farmers in the suburbs have organized militia. More than 3,200 members of the Communist Youth League in Nanchang City held a gathering on the 5th. At the meeting, everyone expressed enthusiastically: We are ready to contribute everything we have to strike at American imperialism at any time.

In recent days, people from all walks of life in Wuhan, Nanning, Nanchang, Kaifeng, and Lanfeng, Weichuan, and Luyi counties in Henan Province have written to local newspapers to express their determination to voluntarily participate in the Korean war against American aggression. Letters from Hubei Daily readers Wu Shangxin, Tu Youguang, and Fan Hong, among others, wrote: American imperialism is frantically slaughtering our neighbors, the elders and brothers of Korea, and we really cannot bear it. We cannot sit idly by and watch American imperialism expand its war of aggression. We are young people, and we know the principles of "if the lips are gone, the teeth will be cold" and "saving your neighbor is saving yourself." We are willing to shed our last drop of blood to go to Korea to participate in the just war against American imperialism.
