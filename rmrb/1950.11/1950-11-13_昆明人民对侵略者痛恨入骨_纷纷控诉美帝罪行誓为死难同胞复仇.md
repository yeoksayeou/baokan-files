Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 9th: The students, professors, and people from all walks of life in Kunming City, who have a glorious history of the "December 1st" struggle against American interference in China's internal affairs and against the Kuomintang's launching of an anti-people civil war, have expressed their firm support for the declarations of various democratic parties and their determination to fight to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend our country. Family members of patriotic martyrs and students who suffered torture under Chiang Kai-shek's rule for opposing the United States have expressed their determination to demand blood debts from the American aggressors.

Zhang Dechang, the elder brother of martyr Zhang Huachang, who was killed by American-made bullets on December 1, 1945, for opposing American imperialism's assistance to Chiang Kai-shek in launching an anti-people war, said: "My sixteen-year-old brother was killed by Chiang Kai-shek's special agents for demanding peace, and the mastermind behind this was none other than American imperialism. Today, it ignores Premier Zhou's repeated warnings and further exposes its aggressive face. With national and family hatred, I must avenge my brother. My elderly father has always loved my brother. After reading the joint declaration yesterday, he said to me: 'We must take practical actions to demand blood debts from American imperialism for Huachang.'"

Li Weixiao, a student who was arrested and tortured by Chiang Kai-shek on July 15, 1948, for participating in the anti-American and pro-Japanese movement, said: "I deeply remember the torture I suffered for opposing the United States. Two years ago, I had the determination to oppose the United States, and today I have even more confidence to defeat the American bandits. I am willing to go to the Korean front to help the Korean people fight to overthrow American imperialism."

Ruan Xingye, who was conscripted as a translator for the U.S. military in 1944 and now works at Yunnan University, said: "In the year and a half, I witnessed with my own eyes the American soldiers' arrogance as rulers, their bullying of translators, and their oppression of the Chinese people. I will never forget their crimes. They once used U.S. dollars to entice translators who studied natural sciences, attempting to use them to 'survey' our country's rich resources from western Yunnan to Xikang and Tibet. This fully exposes American imperialism's long-planned aggressive ambitions."

In addition, personnel who had worked in the war-monger Chennault's "Civil Air Transport" further revealed a series of crimes committed by the U.S. military against the Chinese people. Wang Wenzhi, the current fuelman at the Kunming Aviation Station, said: "Chennault not only aided Chiang Kai-shek in launching an anti-people civil war, but also protected drug trafficking and smuggling, doing everything!" He pointed out that the American beasts often beat Chinese personnel and raped Chinese women, and he himself had been beaten until his body was swollen. When he talked about American imperialism's current preparations to expand its aggression against our country, he said angrily: "American imperialism is always at odds with the Chinese people!" At the same time, Pan Wen and Cheng Xuanqing, workers from the aviation station's motor vehicle team, also expressed their determination to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend our country. They all requested to go to Korea to participate in the Korean people's war of resistance against the United States.

　　昆明人民对侵略者痛恨入骨
　　纷纷控诉美帝罪行誓为死难同胞复仇
    【新华社昆明九日电】有着“一二、一”反对美国干涉中国内政、反对国民党发动反人民内战的光辉斗争历史的昆明市学生、教授和过去曾和美军接触并受其迫害的各界人士，纷纷表示坚决拥护各民主党派宣言，并表示为抗美援朝保家卫国而奋斗。爱国烈士家属及在蒋匪统治时期曾因反美而遭受毒刑的同学，更表示要向美国侵略者索还血债。
    一九四五年十二月一日因反对美帝国主义援助蒋匪发动反人民战争，被美制枪弹杀死的张华昌烈士胞兄张德昌说：“我十六岁的弟弟为要求和平竟被蒋匪特务杀死，而幕后的指使者正是美帝国主义。今天，它竟不顾我周外长的历次警告，更暴露其侵略面目。国仇家恨，我一定要替胞弟报仇。我年迈的父亲一直钟爱胞弟，昨天读过联合宣言后对我说：‘我们要用实际行动替华昌向美帝国主义索还血债。’”
    一九四八年七月十五日因参加反美扶日运动而被蒋匪逮捕受刑的同学李维孝说：“我深深记得因反美而受的酷刑。两年前我有决心反美，今天我更有信心打败美国强盗；我愿到朝鲜前线去帮助朝鲜人民为打倒美帝国主义而斗争。”
    一九四四年曾被征作美军翻译员，现在云大服务的阮兴业说：“在一年半的时间内，我亲眼看见美国军人以统治者的凌人盛气，欺侮译员，欺压中国人民的罪恶，我一辈子也忘不掉。他们曾用美金来引诱学自然科学的译员，企图通过他们从滇西到西康、西藏去‘勘察’我国蕴藏的资源，这充分暴露了美帝国主义蓄意已久的侵略野心。”
    此外，曾在战争贩子陈纳德的“民航队”中工作过的人员，更揭露了美军对中国人民的一连串罪行。现任昆明航空站油料员的王文志说：“陈纳德不但援助蒋匪发动反人民内战，并且包庇贩毒、走私，无所不为！”他指出美国野兽们经常殴打中国人员、强奸中国妇女，而他自己也曾被他们打的混身发肿。当他谈到美帝国主义当前准备对我国扩大侵略时，他愤怒地说：“美帝国主义无时无刻不是在和中国人民为敌！”同时航空站汽车一队工作人员潘文、程宣卿等亦均表示抗美援朝、保家卫国决心，他们都要求赴朝鲜参加朝鲜人民的抗美战争。
