Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 10th (TASS dispatch): The "Pravda" published an article titled "Overcoming All Obstacles" by its London correspondent Mayevsky under the title "On the Eve of the Second World Peace Congress." The article wrote: The last war brought great profits to the gentlemen of London. Now, they are preparing for another war with their Wall Street tycoons, hoping to "earn" more profits. The three-year military build-up plan is heavily burdening the British people. Now, five and a half years have passed since the end of World War II, but food rationing is still in effect in Britain. The British people, like the people of other countries, certainly do not want war. It may be symbolic that the headquarters of the British Peace Committee is located in this city, in this city where the enemies of the British people are weaving a bloody web of new wars. The small rooms are always crowded with people. Here are many volumes of signed peace declarations, as well as leaflets, maps, posters and pamphlets. Letters fly in from all corners of the country. Enclosed in the letters are donations to the fund for the struggle for peace, expressing the British people's warm support for the cause of peace. The Peace Week sponsored by the British Peace Committee is underway, the last week before the opening of the World Peace Congress.

Mayevsky wrote: Despite the insane propaganda against the peace movement, the number of signatories to the peace declaration is constantly increasing. The results of the British signature campaign will be summarized during the Second World Peace Congress, as many of those who are conducting the peace signature campaign will bring the signed peace declarations directly to Sheffield. Active peace fighters include people of all ages and opinions.

In the middle of Peace Week, conferences and rallies to defend peace are being held across Britain. At these meetings, members of the British delegation to the Second World Peace Congress were elected. Posters and leaflets calling for strengthening the struggle for peace are being distributed in the streets of towns.

In response to Prime Minister Attlee's statement on November 1 attempting to slander the Second World Peace Congress, the British Peace Committee issued a declaration entitled "The Truth about the World Peace Congress." It cited concrete facts to expose the lies of the Labor government leaders. In this declaration, the Prague proposal was clearly called "five paths to peace." The Prague proposal has been reprinted on leaflets and has become the subject of paintings and drawings recently published by the British Peace Committee.

The intensification of the struggle for peace within Britain has greatly shocked the British ruling clique. As is well known, Washington has demanded that the British peace movement be paralyzed because this country has been designated to serve as the United States' main aircraft carrier in Europe. In response to Washington's demand to prevent the Second World Peace Congress, the British ruling clique is mobilizing all the levers of "British democracy." The Labor Party leadership has banned its members from signing the peace declaration and attending the congress. The distribution of the peace declaration is prohibited in British schools. Special plans for police measures are being drafted in order not only to prevent active peace fighters from attending the congress, but also to have the police monitor the actions of peace fighters from various countries who, despite all these obstacles, still come to Britain.

According to recent news from various news agencies: visas have been refused to forty Soviet representatives. Visas have also been refused to representatives from the following countries: fourteen members of the Czechoslovak delegation, sixteen members of the Austrian delegation, twelve members of the Bulgarian delegation, thirty-seven members of the Polish delegation, thirteen members of the Romanian delegation, seven from Finland, thirteen from the German Democratic Republic, and all representatives from Mexico, etc.

Not only that, the British authorities had originally agreed to receive eighteen special planes carrying delegates to the congress in London, but announced on November 9 that they would not do so. Apparently, the British authorities are attempting to prevent prominent peace fighters from coming to Sheffield, depriving the congress of their leadership, under the pretext of preventing communists from participating in the congress. The actions of the British authorities have aroused indignation among the British public. Peace conferences are passing resolutions in various places to protest the refusal of visas to representatives attending the Second World Peace Congress.

The scene of the mayor's inauguration ceremony held in London on November 9 was a real demonstration, its task was to incite war psychology. Military bands played and marched past, representatives of the three armed services marched on the central streets, tanks crawled along, and cavalry strode proudly. Above all of this was the slogan: "Volunteers needed! Join now!" However, much to the surprise of the hosts of this scene, hundreds of leaflets were thrown from the crowd on Fleet Street. Londoners rushed to pick them up while the leaflets were still floating. One that we saw read: "Atomic war means the destruction of Britain. The real defense is the struggle for peace."

Peace! This word possesses great truth. No matter how hard the bourgeois newspapers try to suppress the truth about peace and about the Second World Peace Congress, this truth is advancing, breaking through all obstacles.

### “克服一切障碍”——第二届世界和平大会前夕

　　“克服一切障碍”
    ——第二届世界和平大会前夕
    马耶夫斯基
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科十日电：真理报在“第二届世界保卫和平大会前夕”的标题下，刊登了该报驻伦敦记者马耶夫斯基题为《克服一切障碍》的专文。该文写道：上次大战给伦敦城的大人先生们带来很大的利润。现在，他们正在和他们华尔街的大亨们一道准备着另一次战争，希望“赚取”更多的利润。为期三年的整军计划正沉重地压在英国人民身上。现在，第二次世界大战结束已五年半了，但英国的食物仍然实行着配给制。英国人民正和其他国家的人民一样，当然不愿意有战争。英国和平委员会的总部刚好设在这个城市中，在英国人民的敌人正在织造血腥的、新战争的蛛网的这个城市中，这可能是有象征意义的。几个小小的房间里总是拥挤着人。这里有着许多卷的签了名的和平宣言，还有传单、地图、招贴与小册子。信件自全国各个角落纷纷飞来。在信件中附寄有给争取和平斗争基金的捐款，表示英国人民对和平事业的热烈支持。英国和平委员会所主办的和平周正在进行中，这一周是世界保卫和平大会开幕前的最后一周。
    马耶夫斯基写道：尽管有疯狂的反对和平运动的宣传，和平宣言签名者的数目仍在不断增加着。英国签名运动的结果，将在第二届世界和大开会过程中加以总结，因为许多进行和平签名运动的人将把已经签名的和平宣言直接带到设菲尔德来。积极的和平战士中有着各种年纪和各种意见的人们。
    在和平周中间，英国各地正纷纷举行保卫和平的会议与集会。在这些会上，选出了英国出席第二届世界和大的代表团团员。在各城镇的街道中散发着号召加强争取和平斗争的招贴与传单。
    为了回答首相艾德礼十一月一日企图诽谤第二届世界保卫和平大会的声明，英国和平委员会发表题为《关于世界保卫和平大会的真相》的宣言。它引用了具体的事实，揭露工党政府首领的造谣。在这宣言里，把布拉格建议明白地称为“五条走向和平的道路”。布拉格建议已被转载在传单上，并成为英国和平委员会刚刚刊行的书画的题材。
    英国国内争取和平斗争的加紧，使英国统治集团大为震惊。像人所周知的那样，华盛顿要求把英国的和平运动瘫痪起来，因为这个国家已被指定担负美国在欧洲的主要航空母舰的任务。为了答复华盛顿阻止第二届世界和大的要求，英国统治集团正在使“英国民主”的各个杠杆都动起来。工党的领导方面已禁止党员们在和平宣言上签名和参加大会。在英国的学校里禁止分发和平宣言。关于警察措施的特别计划正在起草中，以便不仅防止积极的和平战士参加大会，并且对不顾这一切阻挠仍然来到了英国的各国和平战士的一举一动，都由警察加以监视。
    据各通讯社最近的消息说：四十名苏联代表已被拒发签证。已被拒发签证的还有下列各国代表：捷克斯洛伐克代表团团员十四人、奥地利代表团团员十六人、保加利亚代表团团员十二人、波兰代表团团员三十七人、罗马尼亚代表团团员十三人、芬兰七人、德意志民主共和国代表十三人、墨西哥全体代表等。
    不仅如此，英国当局本来已同意在伦敦接纳十八架搭载和大代表的专机，但是竟在十一月九日宣称他们不这样做了。显然英国当局是企图在阻止共产党参加大会的借口下，阻止著名的和平战士来设菲尔德，使大会失去他们的领袖。英国当局的行为引起了英国公众的愤慨。各地和平会议正纷纷通过决议抗议拒发签证给参加第二届世界和大的代表。
    十一月九日在伦敦举行的市长就职典礼那一幕剧是真正的示威，它的任务本来是煽动战争心理。军乐队吹奏而过，三军的代表在中心街道上行进着，战车爬行着，骑兵高视阔步。超乎所有这些之上的是：“需要志愿兵！立刻参加吧！”的口号声。但是，十分出乎这幕剧的主持人意料之外，从舰队街上的人群中扔出了千百张传单。伦敦人在传单还在飘着的时候就争先去拿着它。我们看到的一张上写道：“原子战争就是英国的毁灭。真正的防御就是争取和平的斗争。”
    和平！这个字具有伟大的真理。无论资产阶级报纸怎样努力企图压制关于和平的与关于第二届世界保卫和平大会的真相，这个真理仍在突破一切障碍而前进着。
