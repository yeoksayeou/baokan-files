　　US-Japan Reactionaries Hold Secret Talks
    Plotting Separate Peace Treaty with Japan
    Attempting to Lift All Restrictions on Japanese Armaments and Stipulating the US Right to Continue Stationing Troops in Japan
    [Xinhua News Agency, 15th] Teletype News Agency on the 13th: According to usually well-informed sources in Tokyo, MacArthur, MacArthur's political advisor Sebald, and the leaders of Japan's Liberal Party, National Democratic Party, and Socialist Party held secret meetings in October to discuss various important issues concerning the separate peace treaty with Japan that the US government is preparing. Those participating in the meeting included Kohtaro Ose of the Liberal Party's advisory board, Saburo Chiba, Secretary-General of the National Democratic Party, and Socialist Party leaders Tetsu Katayama and Inejiro Asanuma. Sebald first pointed out that the United States considers Japan a true ally of the United States in future world wars. Sebald said that this explains why the United States is attempting to restore Japan's military strength and Japan's position on the Asian continent. Sebald then explained the contents of the written proposal prepared by the Japanese Foreign Ministry in cooperation with MacArthur's staff. Sebald said that this written proposal would soon be submitted to the US State Department as the basis for drafting the peace treaty with Japan. The proposal advocates lifting all restrictions on Japanese armaments and Japanese war industries. Sebald told the Japanese politicians that the US and Japanese authorities had reached an agreement on the development of Japan's peaceful industries. The agreement stipulates the establishment of an "Economic Organization for Japan" including representatives from relevant countries. This organization should manage private and national investment in Japanese industry, guarantees for import and export trade with Japan, and various issues related to strategic materials. Regarding territorial issues, Sebald announced that the US and Japanese governments believe that Okinawa, the Volcano Islands, and the Ogasawara Islands may be placed under "international control," which in reality means under US control. Sebald stated that the Japanese government has agreed to the US government's proposal to include many provisions in the draft treaty, stipulating the right of the United States to station troops in Japanese territory after the ratification of the treaty.
    Sebald also called on those attending the meeting to carry out a major propaganda campaign to make people all over the world believe that the US proposal is the "will of the people."

　　美日反动派鬼祟会谈
    策划单独对日缔和
    企图解除对日本军备的一切禁令并要规定美国有权继续在日驻军
    【新华社十五日讯】电通社十三日讯：据东京经常消息灵通人士称，麦克阿瑟、麦克阿瑟的政治顾问赛鲍尔，以及日本的自由党、国民民主党及社会党的领袖们，曾于十月间举行机密会议，讨论关于美国政府正在准备的单独对日和约的各种重要问题。参加会议的有自由党的咨议森幸太郎、国民民主党干事长千叶三郎以及社会党领袖片山哲与浅沼稻次郎等。赛鲍尔首先指出，美国认为日本是将来世界大战中美国的真正盟友。赛鲍尔说，这就说明为什么美国正在企图恢复日本的军事力量以及日本在亚洲大陆上的地位。赛鲍尔遂又解释日本外务省在麦克阿瑟的参谋人员的合作下所准备的书面建议的内容。赛鲍尔说，这个书面建议很快要交与美国国务院，作为起草对日和约的根据。这个建议主张解除对于日本军备与日本战争工业的一切禁令。赛鲍尔告日本政客们说，关于日本和平工业的发展，美国与日本当局已经获致协议。协议中规定建立一个“对日经济机关”，包含有关各国的代表。关于在日本工业中的私人与国家投资、对日进口与出口贸易的保证、以及有关战略物资的各种问题，均应由这个机关管理。关于领土问题，赛鲍尔宣布，美国与日本政府认为可能将冲绳岛、火山岛与小笠原群岛等置于“国际管制”之下，这实际上就是置于美国的管制之下。赛鲍尔称，日本政府已同意美国政府的建议，将许多规定列入和约草案，其中规定在和约批准以后，给美国在日本领土内驻军的权利。
    赛鲍尔并号召参加会议的人进行一次大的宣传运动，使得全世界人士都认为美国的建议是“民众的意志”。
