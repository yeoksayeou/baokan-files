Uncontrollable Anger
    By Our Reporter Yong Jin
    When I stepped into the defense zone of a certain unit of the People's National Defense Forces, I strongly felt the anger of the patriotic soldiers aroused by the aggression of American imperialism. Cadres and the broad masses of soldiers profoundly understood the spirit of Commander-in-Chief Zhu's order issued on this year's National Day, and familiarly remembered the two sentences in Premier Zhou's National Day speech: "The Chinese people love peace, but in order to defend peace, they have never been and will never be afraid of resisting wars of aggression."
    On the vast defense line, I saw the achievements of the people's soldiers in the cause of peaceful construction after a long period of war, within a short period of time. A town in North China, destroyed into near ruins by the Kuomintang bandits, in just over a year, they themselves built the houses they would live in—beautiful and clean tile-roofed houses and buildings. Here, I also saw the flocks of ducks raised by the soldiers themselves, floating in the boundless blue waves. The soldiers also raised chickens and fat pigs. The fish raised by the soldiers in the fish ponds have grown up, and the harvest season has arrived. The director of this production unit told me that they could harvest more than 100,000 jin of fish this year. This is only a small part of their sideline production. This year, they can earn 300 million yuan from contracting, repairing railways, digging rivers, and transporting stone projects. The soldiers have achieved an exciting harvest on the agricultural front, with an average yield of 500 to 600 jin of grain per mu, and a good yield of more than 1,100 jin. During the great production this spring, the soldiers reclaimed more than 4,000 mu of alkaline wasteland. At that time, many people said, "What's the use of reclaiming this alkaline land? It would be good if you could catch some seedlings." Now that the harvest has arrived, the people praise their army and say, "The Liberation Army can do anything well." The soldiers' harvest has increased the country's income, and they said happily, "This harvest is the result of our implementation of Chairman Mao's production instructions." In another unit, I heard about the miracles they created in cultural learning during training and production. Gao Dengke, the squad leader of the sixth squad of a certain unit, learned 2,600 Chinese characters in a year and helped eliminate illiteracy among all the members of the squad who knew less than 700 characters. He can now write letters, write manuscripts, and can understand newspapers. Before the military training, 46% of the entire army of a certain army knew less than 300 characters. After a year of study, only 9% remained.
    However, American imperialism regards the Chinese people's desire for peace as weakness and vulnerability, and its frantic aggression has aroused great anger among the soldiers. They are closely watching the development of the current situation, and they are paying great attention to the Korean people. They are constantly searching on the map for the villages and towns of the Korean people occupied by the US imperialists and the places bombed by US aircraft. They regard the disaster of the Korean people as their own disaster. Cadres and soldiers generally remember the help given by the Korean people to the Chinese people during the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation. Yang Zhensheng, a civil affairs cadre living in Zhuozhou County, Hebei, made such a recollection. During the extremely brutal War of Resistance Against Japan, the democratic county magistrate of our Zhuozhou County was Comrade Wang Wei, a Korean. He said: "The blood of the Korean people has been spilled all over our Northeast and Jiangnan. Now the Korean people are suffering from the disasters brought by American imperialism. We must actively support them." Five or six Northeast soldiers, recalling the past 14 years of life as slaves of a subjugated nation, said: "Now American imperialism is taking the road that was taken by the Japanese imperialism that was eliminated. We must never allow our hometowns, which have embarked on freedom and happiness, to return to the life of slaves of a subjugated nation before 'August 15th'. Only by resolutely attacking the American imperialism that is invading us and the Korean people can we defend peace."
    Everywhere, one can hear the uncontrollable voices of anger from the soldiers. Huang Shutian, who attended the National Congress of Combat Heroes, said: "American imperialism is not only attacking us now, but also aided Chiang Kai-shek with a large number of weapons during the War of Liberation, which were used to attack the liberated areas. Now the US imperialists have placed the Seventh Fleet in our Taiwan, preventing us from liberating Taiwan. We must knock out the claws of the US imperialists." Mei Dehong, a veteran soldier of a certain regiment's direct team, said: "We will not allow the US imperialists to disturb the Chinese and Korean people who have just turned over. We have the experience of eliminating the American-supported Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and this experience can also be used on the American aggressors who are invading peaceful people." I talked to Li Shuiqing, who joined the Red Army when he was a teenager. He went through five "encirclements and suppressions", the Long March, the War of Resistance Against Japan, and the War of Liberation. He went from bugler to soldier, and now serves as a division commander. He told me that he exchanged the spear he had for Chiang Kai-shek's rifle in the first anti-"encirclement and suppression" campaign. Afterwards, the transportation captain Chiang Kai-shek equipped them again and again, so that they now have modern weapons. He said: "Weapons can only give full play to their role in the hands of the people's soldiers." This sentence has been fully proven from our operations against the American-supported Chiang's army and many liberated soldiers. It proves that no weapon, including the atomic bomb, can determine the outcome of a war. What determines the outcome is truth, justice, and the awakening of the broad masses of people. Chairman Mao said: "The army and the people are the foundation of victory." If the war provocateurs who believe in weapons still do not understand this truth, then let them be destroyed!
    The Chinese People's Liberation Army, which has combat experience, production experience, and cultural education, is vigilantly guarding its motherland. In the training in the past stage, all kinds of skills have been greatly improved. Many troops and units can assemble the entire company as soon as the assembly call sounds. In the training, a certain army has produced 64 outstanding shooting units and 4,872 top-notch shooters of various firearms. In various weapon scientific tests, more than 70% achieved excellent results. This fully shows that the combat effectiveness of our national defense forces has greatly improved.
    These soldiers are not satisfied with their achievements. Recently, they have put all their energy into strengthening preparations for national defense. The soldiers, Communist Party members, and Communist Youth League members of the bayonet training team of a certain regiment learned ten bayonet subjects in seven days. Ma Yukun, a young Communist Party member, in order to learn bayonet quickly, practiced in the moonlight, watching his own shadow, in addition to studying during the day. Wang Yugui and Lu Xiaozhou, soldiers of the motorized infantry regiment of a certain unit, refused letters from their parents asking them to go home to get married because of their high anti-American imperialist sentiment. In the motorized infantry unit, I saw a letter from the entire company of soldiers to Commander-in-Chief Zhu. The letter said: "We are always vigilant about the imperialism around us. If it dares to invade our territory, we will resolutely wipe it out on the national defense line. We are preparing to make contributions in the war against aggression and meet you at the Second National Congress of Heroes." The bayonets of the patriotic soldiers have been unsheathed, and the blood of the patriotic soldiers is boiling. In the guard company of a certain unit, I also saw the following poem written by soldiers Fu Xichun, Liu Xingshun, and Wu Bingyi to Chairman Mao:
    "We are revolutionary soldiers, the sons and daughters of the people,
    Wherever we are needed, we will go,
    To defend the motherland, to defend victory,
    To monitor the robber imperialists.
    If they dare to go crazy and disturb,
    We will eliminate them wherever they come from.
    Chairman Mao!
    We assure you,
    We will carry the revolution through to the end!"

　　不可遏止的愤怒
    本报记者勇进
    当我踏进人民国防部队某部防地的时候，我强烈地感觉到由于美帝国主义的侵略所激起的爱国战士们的愤怒。干部们与广大战士们，都深刻地领会了朱总司令在今年国庆节所发布的命令的精神，熟习地记忆着周总理在国庆节演说中的两句话：“中国人民热爱和平，但是为了保卫和平，从不也永不害怕反抗侵略战争。”
    在广阔的国防线上，我看到人民战士们在长期战争之后，在不长的时间中所从事的和平建设事业的成就。华北某地一个被国民党匪帮毁成近乎废墟的镇子，仅仅在一年多的时间里，他们自己就建造了自己要住的房子——美丽而洁净的瓦屋与楼房。在这里，我还看到了战士们亲手养大的鸭群，鸭子浮荡在一望无垠的碧波中。战士们还养了鸡群和肥猪。战士们在渔塘里养的鱼已长大了，丰收季节已经到来。这个生产单位的主任告诉我，他们今年可收到十万多斤鱼。这仅仅是他们的一点副业生产。他们今年在包工、修铁路、挖河、运石工程中，可以收入三亿元。战士们在农业战线上得到一个令人兴奋的丰收，平均每亩可收五、六百斤粮食，好的可收到一千一百多斤。今春大生产时，战士们开碱荒四千多亩，当时不少群众说：“你们开这碱地有什么用，能捉着苗也就不错啦。”现在丰收了，群众赞美自己的军队说：“解放军干啥啥行”。战士们的丰收增加了国家的收入，他们高兴地说：“这个丰收是我们执行毛主席生产指示的结果。”在另一个部队里，我听到他们在整训生产中所创造的文化学习的奇迹。某部六班长高登科，一年中学会了两千六百字，并帮助消灭了全班认识七百字以下的文盲，他现在会写信、写稿，已能看懂报纸。某军在未练兵之前，全军识三百字以下的占百分之四十六，经过一年来的学习，只占百分之九了。
    但是美帝国主义把中国人民热爱和平的愿望，认为是软弱可欺，它的疯狂侵略，激起了战士们的极大愤怒。他们密切注意着时局形势的发展，他们对朝鲜人民寄以极大的关怀。他们不断地在地图上搜寻着美帝所侵占的朝鲜人民的村庄、城镇及我们被美机轰炸的地方。他们将朝鲜人民的灾难看做自己的灾难。干部战士们一般的都记得抗日战争与解放战争中朝鲜人民给予中国人民的帮助。家住河北涿县的民运干部杨振声作了这样的一段回忆。在极残酷的抗日战争中，我们涿县的民主县长就是一个朝鲜籍的王巍同志。他说：“朝鲜人民的鲜血洒遍了我们的东北与江南，现在朝鲜人民遭受着美帝国主义带来的灾难，我们要积极地支援他们。”五六个东北战士在回忆过去十四年的亡国奴的生活时说：“现在美帝国主义正走着被消灭的日本帝国主义所走过的道路。决不能使我们已经走上自由幸福的家乡，再回复到“八一五”以前的亡国奴生活，只有坚决的打击侵犯我们及朝鲜人民的美帝国主义，才能保卫和平。”
    到处都可听到战士们不可遏制的愤怒声音。出席全国战斗英雄大会的黄树田说：“美帝国主义不仅现在向我们进攻，在解放战争中就援助蒋介石大批的武器，用以进攻解放区。现在美帝又将第七舰队停在我们的台湾，阻止我们解放台湾。我们必需打掉美帝的爪牙。”某团直属队的老战士梅得红说：“我们不允许美帝扰乱刚翻身的中国人民及朝鲜人民，我们有消灭美化蒋家匪帮的经验，这些经验还可用到侵略和平人民的美国侵略者头上去。”我曾和一个十几岁参加红军的李水清谈话，他经过了五次“围剿”长征、抗日战争、解放战争。他从小号兵到战士，现在担任了师长。他告诉我，他在第一次反“围剿”中将自己所拿的梭镖换了蒋介石的步枪。之后，运输队长蒋介石一次又一次地把他们装备起来，使他们现在有了近代化的武器。他说：“武器只有在人民战士手中，才能充分发挥它的作用。”这句话从我们对美化蒋军的作战中及许多被解放的战士中得到了充分的证明。它证明着任何武器，包括原子弹在内，不能决定战争的胜负。决定胜负的在于真理，正义，在于广大人民的觉悟。毛主席说过：“兵民是胜利之本。”迷信武器的战争挑拨者假如还不懂得这个道理，那就让它灭顶吧！
    有战斗经验的，有生产经验的，有文化教养的中国人民解放军，他们正在十分警惕地守卫着自己的祖国。他们在过去一个阶段的练兵中，各种技术都有很大的提高。很多部队单位，在集合号声一落时就可集合起全连的队伍。练兵中，某军涌现了六十四个优胜射击单位，四千八百七十二名甲等各种火器射手。各种兵器科学测验，百分之七十以上的成绩优良。这充分表明了我们国防部队战斗力已大大提高了一步。
    这些战士们对自己的成绩并不满足，最近更将全部精力放在加强国防的准备。某团刺杀教练队的战士们、共产党员、青年团员们，七天学会了十个刺杀课目。年青的共产党员马玉昆，为了急于学会刺杀，除了白天学习之外，深夜在月光下看着自己的影子练习。某部摩托步兵团的战士王玉桂、卢孝周因为他们的高度反美帝侵略情绪，拒绝了父母叫他们回家结婚的来信。在摩托步兵部队我看到了一个连的全体战士给朱总司令的信，信上说：“我们时刻地警惕着我们身旁的帝国主义，如果他敢侵略我国的领土，就坚决地把它消灭在国防线上。我们准备着在反侵略的战争中立功，在第二次全国英雄大会上与你见面。”爱国战士们的刺刀已脱出了鞘，爱国战士们的热血在沸腾。在某部警卫连，我还看到战士符锡纯、刘兴顺、吴炳一寄给毛主席的一首诗里这样写道：
    “我们是革命战士，是人民的子弟兵，
    需要我们到那里就到那里，
    保卫祖国，保卫胜利，
    监视强盗帝国主义。
    如果它胆敢来逞疯扰乱，
    从那里来就叫他消灭在那里。
    毛主席！
    我们向你保证，
    将革命进行到底！”
