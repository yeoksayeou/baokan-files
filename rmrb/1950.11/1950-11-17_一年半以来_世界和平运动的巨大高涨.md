    It has been exactly a year and a half since the first World Congress of Defenders of Peace held on April 20th last year to the current Second World Congress of Defenders of Peace. In the past year and a half, the worldwide movement to defend peace has achieved unprecedented development. Now, peace-loving people all over the world have formed a strong front. The 800 million people of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, the German Democratic Republic, and the various People's Democratic countries are the backbone of this front. Together with the working people in capitalist countries who are striving for peace, democracy, and freedom, and the oppressed people in colonial and semi-colonial countries who are striving for independence and liberation, the peace army united under the banner of peace led by the Soviet Union is more than one billion strong, accounting for half of humanity. Half of humanity is organized to participate in the struggle for peace, which is an unprecedented event in history. This force is the guarantee that peace will inevitably triumph over war.
    In the past year and a half, the work of the World Congress of Defenders of Peace Standing Committee, the unified leading body of the world peace movement, has played a great role in the vigorous development of the peace movement. On July 29, 1949, the Standing Committee and its Executive Bureau decided to make October 2nd the "International Day of Struggle for Peace." In September, the Standing Committee issued a declaration calling for the organization of large-scale demonstrations worldwide. On October 2nd of that year, vast numbers of people in 60 countries responded to the call and held large-scale peace demonstrations, demonstrating the irresistible strength of peace defenders. On October 29th, the second plenary session of the Standing Committee of the World Congress proposed three specific peace proposals: (1) To immediately conduct direct negotiations to stop the wars being waged in Greece, Vietnam, Indonesia, and Malaya. (2) To immediately reduce armaments and declare atomic weapons illegal. (3) To sign a peace pact between major powers within the United Nations framework. On December 16th, the Executive Bureau of the Standing Committee of the World Congress notified the parliaments of all countries of the above proposals, urging governments to adopt them. On February 25th of this year, the Secretariat of the Standing Committee decided to organize delegations to deliver these proposals to the parliaments of various countries, urging them to work for peace.
    Countries received the delegations of the World Congress with different attitudes. The parliaments of the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries fully accepted the proposals of the Standing Committee of the World Congress and expressed their determination to fight for peace. On the other hand, the British Parliament refused to meet with the delegation, and the United States unreasonably refused the delegation entry, which fully exposed their pursuit of war. However, the proposals of the Standing Committee of the World Congress were sincerely supported by the people all over the world. The British people raised flags with the words "Peace!" and "Ban Atomic Bombs!" on the roof of the parliament building, and the American people organized a committee to welcome the delegation and launched a peace movement in many cities.
    In March of this year, in response to the intensified preparations for a war of aggression by the United States through the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the Standing Committee of the World Congress held its third plenary session in Stockholm, the capital of Sweden, and put forward a clearer program of action. The meeting issued a peace declaration, resolutely demanding an unconditional ban on atomic weapons and declaring the government that first uses atomic weapons a war criminal. At the same time, the meeting called on all those who agreed with this proposition to actively sign the declaration.
    The resolution of the Stockholm meeting reflected the wishes of the vast majority of people in the world. Peace-loving people enthusiastically responded to the call and quickly launched a movement to sign the peace declaration. According to the announcement of the London meeting of the Executive Bureau of the Standing Committee of the World Congress, within two months from March to May, 100 million people worldwide had signed the peace declaration. Many countries also widely organized local peace committees. In Hungary, a People's Democratic country, 27,000 peace committees had been established nationwide in May; in Italy, a capitalist country, 19,471 peace committees had been established in various institutions, enterprises, and residential areas.
    Since the U.S. imperialists launched a war of aggression in Korea in June of this year, thereby seriously threatening world peace, a mass movement against U.S. aggression and supporting the Korean people has rapidly unfolded throughout the world, further pushing the movement to defend world peace to a climax. Countless rallies were held throughout the Soviet Union, and hundreds of millions of people unanimously issued angry protests, demanding that the U.S. aggressors withdraw from Korea. At the same time, the working people organized Stakhanovite-style "peace work teams" to further strengthen the Soviet Union's national strength with outstanding labor achievements, so as to consolidate the peace front. In China, anti-American aggression Taiwan and Korea week were widely held across the country, and large-scale anti-aggression demonstrations were held in various places during the "August 1st" Army Day. Because U.S. imperialism disregarded the repeated opposition and warnings of the Chinese people and frantically burned the flames of the war of aggression against Korea to China, the people of the whole country have widely launched a powerful movement to "resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, protect our homes and defend our country." The People's Democratic countries in Southeast Europe have widely held "Support Korea People Movement Weeks." The Hungarian people sent medical teams to serve on the front lines in Korea. In capitalist countries, peace advocates have also generally launched struggles against aggression. More than 10,000 citizens of New York in the United States held a mass demonstration on June 28th "against intervention in Korea." Australian seamen, Italian sailors, and Japanese dockworkers bravely refused to serve ships transporting U.S. munitions to Korea. Progressive people all over the world unanimously realized that: more powerfully organizing to extinguish the flames of aggression has become the current urgent task of defending world peace.
    At the same time, the worldwide peace signature campaign has developed more vigorously. The Soviet people began collecting signatures on June 30th. In just over a month, they achieved the brilliant result of 115,514,703 signatures. The number of signatures in China has surged from more than 26.7 million at the end of June to the recent 223,531,898. In the major capitalist countries, the number of signatures in the United States has recently exceeded 2.5 million. Among them, 2.1 million were collected after Truman ordered the invasion of Korea. The number of signatures in France has increased from 7 million in mid-June to the current 15 million, Italy has surged from 8 million in mid-June to more than 16 million, the United Kingdom has also exceeded 1.17 million, and Japan has reached 5.86 million. The number of signatures worldwide has recently reached 500 million.
    In order to further develop the movement against wars of aggression and to defend peace, the Executive Bureau of the Standing Committee of the World Congress held a meeting in Prague in August, calling on the people of the world to prepare for the Second World Congress of Defenders of Peace to be held in the United Kingdom on November 13th, demanding a ban on all destructive weapons, opposing all acts of aggression, and peacefully resolving the Korean War. This call immediately received a wide response throughout the world. Peace advocates from various countries convened peace rallies, elected representatives to attend the Second World Congress of Defenders of Peace, and expanded various demands in the peace program. The Soviet people proposed that the current focus should be on advocating disarmament, prohibiting all propaganda that incites war, and requesting the Second World Peace Congress to compile a list of war merchants around the world. The Chinese people demanded that the U.S. war of aggression against Korea be stopped, as this has become the central key to defending world peace. The German people firmly supported the statement of the eight foreign ministers' meeting on the German question. The unanimous determination of peace-loving people around the world to safeguard the cause of peace has greatly alarmed the war merchants. Under the instigation of U.S. imperialism, the British Labour Party government used unprecedentedly despicable means, using rumor-mongering, delays, fraud, capriciousness, and even brutally using secret police methods, to try its best to sabotage the holding of the congress in the United Kingdom. This barbaric behavior has been met with angry condemnation from the British people and protests from progressive people all over the world.
    Now, the Second World Congress of Defenders of Peace has been changed to be held in Warsaw, the capital of Poland, on the 16th. As the preparatory committee of the congress said: when mankind faces a threat, the congress will bring hope. Representatives from different regions and social fields of the world, holding various views, will discuss effective ways to show the great truth of peace's inevitable victory to the people of the world, and further point out the path to stop wars of aggression.

### 一年半以来  世界和平运动的巨大高涨

    一年半以来
    世界和平运动的巨大高涨
    自去年四月二十日举行的第一届世界保卫和平大会到目前的第二届世界保卫和平大会，已经整整一年半过去了。一年半以来，全世界保卫和平的大运动，已经获得了空前的发展，现在全世界爱好和平的人民已组成了一条强固的阵线。苏联、中华人民共和国、德意志民主共和国及各人民民主国家的八亿人民，是这条阵线的中坚力量。加上资本主义国家中争取和平、民主与自由的劳动人民，和殖民地、半殖民地国家中争取独立解放的被压迫人民，团结在以苏联为首的和平旗帜之下的，已是一支十亿以上的和平大军，它占了全人类的半数。人类的半数有组织地参加争取和平的斗争，这是历史上从来未有的大事情。这个力量便是和平必然战胜战争的保证。
    一年半以来，世界和平运动的统一领导机构——世界保卫和平大会常设委员会所进行的工作，对和平运动的蓬勃发展起了伟大的作用。一九四九年七月二十九日，和大常委会执行局决定以十月二日为“国际和平斗争日”。九月，常设委员会发出宣言，号召组织全世界规模的大示威。这年十月二日，有六十个国家的广大人民响应号召，举行了大规模的和平示威，显示了和平保卫者的不可抗拒的力量。十月二十九日，和大常设委员会第二届全体会议，又提出了三项具体的和平建议：（一）立即进行直接谈判，以停止正在希腊、越南、印尼、马来亚进行的战争。（二）立即裁减军备，宣布原子武器为非法。（三）在联合国机构内签订大国间的和平公约。十二月十六日，和大常委会执行局将上述建议分别通知了世界各国的议会，敦促各国政府予以采纳。今年二月二十五日，常委会秘书处又决定组织代表团，分别向各国议会递送这些建议。敦促它们为和平而努力。
    各国以不同的态度接待了和大代表团。苏联及各人民民主国家的议会，完全接受了和大常委会的建议，并表示了为和平而斗争的决心。但在另一方面，英国国会拒绝接见代表团，而美国则无理地拒绝代表团入境，这样就完全暴露了它们追求战争的目的。但是，和大常委会的建议却获得了全世界人民的衷心拥护。英国人民就在国会的楼顶上升起了写着“和平！”“禁止原子弹！”的旗帜，美国人民组织了欢迎代表团的委员会，并在许多城市中开展了和平运动。
    今年三月，针对美国通过北大西洋集团国家加紧准备侵略战争的情况，和大常委会在瑞典京城斯德哥尔摩举行第三届全体会议，提出了更为鲜明的行动纲领。会议发出了和平宣言，坚决要求无条件禁止原子武器，并宣布第一个使用原子武器的政府为战犯。会议同时号召凡是赞成这一主张的人在宣言上踊跃签名。
    斯德哥尔摩会议的决议反映了世界绝大多数人民的愿望。爱好和平的人民热烈地响应号召，迅速地展开了在和平宣言上签名的运动。根据和大常设委员会执行局伦敦会议宣布，从三月到五月的两个月内，全世界已有一亿人民在和平宣言上签了名。许多国家同时广泛地组织了地方性的和平委员会。在人民民主国家的匈牙利，五月间全国已成立了二万七千个和平委员会；在资本主义国家的意大利，在各机关、企业与住宅区成立的和平委员会，已有一万九千四百七十一个。
    自从今年六月美帝国主义在朝鲜发动了侵略战争，从而严重地威胁了全世界的和平以来，一个反对美国侵略、支援朝鲜人民的群众性运动，即在全世界各地迅速展开，从而把保卫世界和平的运动更推向高潮。苏联全国各地举行了无数次的集会，亿万人民一致发出愤怒的抗议，要求美国侵略者退出朝鲜。同时，劳动人民纷纷组织了斯塔哈诺夫式的“和平工作班”，以卓异的劳动成果进一步增强苏联的国力，以巩固和平阵线。在中国，全国各地纷纷举行了反对美国侵略台湾朝鲜周，在“八一”建军节各地并举行了反侵略的大示威。由于美帝国主义不顾中国人民的屡次反对与警告，疯狂地把侵朝战争的火焰烧向中国，因此全国人民广泛展开了“抗美援朝、保家卫国”的强大运动。东南欧各人民民主国家均曾广泛举行了“支援朝鲜人民运动周”。匈牙利人民派出了医疗队到朝鲜前线服务。在资本主义国家里，和平拥护者也普遍展开了反对侵略的斗争。美国纽约市民一万余人于六月二十八日举行了“反对干涉朝鲜”的群众示威大会。澳洲的海员、意大利的水手和日本的船坞工人，都英勇地拒绝为运送美国军火到朝鲜去的船只服务。全世界进步人类一致认识到：更有力地组织起来扑灭侵略的凶焰，已成为保卫世界和平的当前急务。
    与此同时，全世界的和平签名运动更汹涌澎湃地发展起来。苏联人民在六月三十日开始征集签名。仅仅一个多月，就获得一亿一千五百五十一万四千七百零三人签名的辉煌成绩。中国的签名人数，已从六月底的二千六百七十余万人，激增到最近的二亿二千三百五十三万一千八百九十八人。在主要的资本主义国家里，美国的签名人数最近已突破了二百五十万人。其中二百一十万是在杜鲁门下令侵略朝鲜之后征集的。法国签名的人数已从六月中旬的七百万增加到目前的一千五百万，意大利则从六月中旬的八百万激增到一千六百万以上，英国也超过了一百一十七万，日本达到了五百八十六万。全世界的签名人数最近已达到了五亿。
    为了更进一步地展开反对侵略战争和保卫和平的运动，世界和大常设委员会执行局八月在布拉格举行会议，号召全世界人民筹备在十一月十三日在英国召开第二届世界保卫和平大会，要求禁止一切毁灭性武器，反对一切侵略行为及和平解决朝鲜战争。这一号召即刻在全世界获得了广泛的响应。各国和平拥护者纷纷召开了和平集会，推选了出席第二届世界保卫和平大会的代表，并扩大了和平纲领中的各项要求。苏联人民提出目前应主张裁减军备，禁止一切鼓吹战争的宣传，并要求第二届世界和平大会编制全世界战争贩子的名单。中国人民要求制止美国侵略朝鲜的战争，因为这已成为保卫世界和平的中心关键。德国人民坚决拥护八国外长会议对于德国问题的声明。全世界和平人民所表示的一致维护和平事业的决心，已使战争贩子大感恐慌。在美帝国主义的主使下，英国工党政府使用了前所未闻的卑劣手段，利用造谣、拖延、欺诈、反复无常、以至蛮横使用秘密警察的方法，竭力破坏大会在英国举行。这一蛮横行为已遭到英国人民的愤怒的谴责和全世界进步人民的抗议。
    现在第二届世界保卫和平大会已改于十六日在波兰首都华沙举行。正如大会筹备委员会所说：当人类面临着威胁的时候，大会将带来希望。来自世界各个不同地区、各个不同社会领域，持有各种见解的代表们，将会商有效的办法，向全世界人民昭示和平必胜的伟大真理，并且进一步指出制止侵略战争的道路。
