Beijing Municipal Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Staff Statement
Willing to Contribute Everything to Resist America and Aid Korea

To the Editor:

We, the entire staff of the Beijing Municipal Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, are extremely angered by the brutal and shameless American imperialist aggression against Korea, and their repeated violations of our country's territory, airspace, and territorial waters. After studying and discussing the current international situation, we resolutely and unanimously express our determination to resist America and aid Korea, and to support Premier Zhou's solemn statement that "we cannot stand idly by." Our main reasons are:

First, China and Korea are brotherly countries as closely related as lips and teeth, and American imperialism is also our people's most vicious enemy. The enemy is attempting to follow the old path of Japanese imperialism, using Korea as a springboard to invade China and attack the Soviet Union. Now the enemy is directly threatening our security. "When the lips are gone, the teeth will be cold." We feel that we should not and cannot sit idly by in this situation.

Second, although American imperialism has been driven out of mainland China, it occupies our territory of Taiwan and directly provides armed assistance to the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. It has repeatedly invaded our Northeast and Shandong airspace, intruded into our territorial waters, attacked our ships, and murdered and harmed the lives and property of our people. Our motherland and people are sacred and inviolable, and the enemy's mad and adventurous provocative acts must be severely punished.

Third, the enemy has violated all international laws, contravened the United Nations Charter, and disregarded humanity and the protests of people all over the world. They stubbornly and willfully jumped across the Pacific Ocean to carry out a barbaric war of forcible occupation, massacre, and enslavement of other countries and peoples. This is the most ferocious war of aggression, and they are wantonly expanding this aggression. It is entirely reasonable, justified, and legal for the Chinese people to support the Korean people in eliminating these mad dogs. We believe that the more thoroughly we fight back against such an enemy, the more we uphold justice. It is not only the right but also the duty of the Chinese people to support the Korean people in using a just war to fight back against and defeat the war of aggression.

Fourth, we love peace, but we do not want a false peace disguised as cosmopolitanism and nationalism, because we are unwilling to be slaves and cattle under the slavery and rule of imperialism and the oppressive classes. We oppose war, but we do not oppose a just war against aggression armed with internationalism and patriotism, because we want to live freely, happily, and peacefully. Therefore, when the enemy destroys peace, we rise up to defend peace; when the enemy uses war to carry out aggression, we resolutely support a just war to counter aggression. Therefore, we love peace, but we are never afraid of war.

Fifth, peace is severely threatened and destroyed, and the enemy is expanding aggression. Therefore, the Chinese people's support for the Korean people's just war at this time is the most effective way to defend Eastern peace and world peace.

The people of the world are besieging the enemy, the forces of peace far outweigh the enemy, the enemy is becoming increasingly difficult, and we are becoming increasingly strong. We have full confidence and strength to defeat and annihilate the enemy. Victory will surely belong to us.

We comrades engaged in Friendship Association work are loyal internationalists and also ardent patriots. We are determined to do a good job in internationalist education that "leans to one side" towards the Soviet Union, and in propaganda work that hates, despises, and belittles American imperialism, and are ready at any time to contribute everything we have to resolutely, thoroughly, and completely eliminate the enemy!

### 京市中苏友协工作人员声明  愿贡献一切抗美援朝

　　京市中苏友协工作人员声明
    愿贡献一切抗美援朝编辑同志：
    我们，北京市中苏友好协会全体工作同志，对美帝残暴无耻地侵略朝鲜，并一再侵犯我国领土、领空、领海的暴行，痛恨之极。我们在研究和讨论了目前的国际形势之后，坚决一致表示抗美援朝，拥护周总理“不能置之不理”的严正声明。我们的主要理由是：
    第一、中国与朝鲜是兄弟般唇齿相依的国家，美帝也是我国人民最凶恶的敌人。敌人正企图走日本帝国主义的老路，把朝鲜当作侵占中国和进犯苏联的跳板。现在敌人已经直接威胁着我们的安全，“唇亡齿寒”，我们觉得对这种情势决不应也不能坐视。
    第二、美帝虽然已从中国大陆上被赶走，但它霸占了我国的领土台湾，直接以武装援助蒋介石匪帮。并一再进犯我国东北和山东的领空，侵入我国领海，袭击我国船只，屠杀和损害我国人民的生命和财产。我们的祖国和人民是神圣不可侵犯的，对敌人这种疯狂冒险的挑衅行为，必须严厉制裁。
    第三、敌人破坏了一切国际公法，违背了联合国宪章，不顾人道和全世界人民的抗议，一意孤行地跳到太平洋的对岸，来进行野蛮强占、屠杀、奴役他国人民和民族的战争，这是最凶暴的侵略战争，并且还肆意扩大这种侵略，中国人民支援朝鲜人民来消灭这些疯狗，都是合情合理合法的。我们认为：对这样的敌人越加彻底反击，就愈是坚持正义。中国人民支援朝鲜人民用正义的战争来还击并战胜侵略战争，不但是权利，而且是应尽的义务。
    第四、我们是爱好和平的，但我们并不要虚假的在世界主义和民族主义伪装下的和平，因为我们不愿在帝国主义和压迫阶级的奴役和统治下做牛马奴隶；我们反对战争，但我们并不反对在国际主义和爱国主义思想武装下的反侵略的正义战争，因为我们要自由幸福和平地生活下去。所以当敌人破坏和平的时候，我们起来保卫和平，当敌人用战争进行侵略的时候，我们就决然支援正义的战争来反侵略。因此我们是爱好和平的，但也决不害怕战争。
    第五、和平受到了严重的威胁和破坏，敌人正在扩大侵略。因此，中国人民在这个时候支援朝鲜人民的正义战争，正是保卫东方和平和世界和平最有效的方法。
    全世界的人民围困着敌人，和平的力量远远超过了敌人，敌人越来越加困难，我们越来越加壮大，我们有充分的信心和力量战胜和歼灭敌人，胜利一定是属于我们的。
    我们从事友协工作的同志是忠诚的国际主义者，也是热烈的爱国主义者。我们决心要搞好向苏联“一边倒”的国际主义教育和对美帝仇恨、蔑视和卑视的宣传工作，并随时准备着贡献出我们的一切，把敌人坚决彻底全部干净地消灭掉！
