　　Bloodstains in Heishanhu Village, a Suburb of Beijing
　　·Ding Zi·
　　Wherever the beastly American troops go, they leave behind tragic bloodstains!

　　Heishanhu Village is a village in the western suburbs of Beijing, about 25 miles from the city, inhabited by poor farmers. Northwest of the village is a small hill called "Heishantou" (Black Mountain Head). The hilltop is crowned with countless green rocks, and the hillside has hundreds of years of terraced fields cultivated by diligent farmers. There are also dozens of mud houses where generations of poor farmers and stonemasons live.

　　Heishantou - it is a place that has been ravaged by Japanese and American imperialism. Whenever it is mentioned, the local people grind their teeth in anger. The people who live there have suffered so many disasters! They will never forget that when American imperialism was entrenched in Beijing, they came to Heishanhu Village in droves, with cars and weapons, to conduct live-fire exercises every two or three days, flaunting their power. Heishantou was their target. The nearby people suffered a lot. The cannon fire damaged the roofs, window paper, and glass of their mud houses, and the explosives destroyed their crops. The most unlucky were the people living on the mountainside of Heishantou. Whenever the American devils practiced shooting, they had to eat breakfast in the dark. Before they could finish eating, the American devils would drive them away. They had no choice but to support the old and carry the young, leaving their homes far behind to squat in the gullies all day, unable to do any work in the fields, until the lights came on at night before they could go home. If they encountered windy and rainy weather, they would suffer even more, and in winter they would be covered in frostbite. In good harvest years, they could bring two pieces of dry food to avoid the shells, but in famine years, even two meals of vegetable porridge were eleven or twelve hours apart.

　　On the morning of March 31, 1947, the 5th Regiment of the U.S. Marine Corps stationed in Beijing broke into Heishanhu Village again and began live-fire exercises. The local villagers were not notified in advance, and there were no warnings in the exercise area. The unexploded shells were also thrown around arbitrarily. That afternoon, after 4 o'clock, the cannon fire stopped, and the poor children of the village came to the American shooting range in groups of two and three. They wanted to pick up some mixed vegetables and scraps of shell casings. The canned food, biscuits, bread, candy, etc., left behind by the American troops during their exercises became precious items for the poor people there. The scraps of shell casings could also be picked up and sold for a few pennies. Among the children, one named Yuan Wenxing met an American soldier holding a shell, who shouted at him, "Do you want to buy this shell?" Yuan Wenxing said, "Scrap shell casings are one hundred yuan per catty; I don't want unexploded ones." The American soldier insisted on selling it to him. After getting his fill of mischief, the American soldier laughed loudly and threw the shell there, not caring. A little while later, the village children Li Xiaoliu and his seven-year-old brother Li Xiaomazi, along with Liu Xiaoyuan, ran to the shell to look at it. Suddenly, the shell exploded, and the three poor children lost their lives. About a yard away from the shell, three children named Yang Erding, Shen Dazhuangzi, and Song Qiyou, who were squatting and playing chess, were also innocently seriously injured. At the same time, another shell exploded, taking the life of another innocent child, Ma Xiaowu.

　　A few days ago, I visited these unfortunate victims and their families. At the foot of Heishantou Mountain, in a courtyard with reed-filled walls, I found Yang Erding. The first thing that caught my attention was his terribly thin legs, and then his ankle bone protruding from his leg, lying sideways under his leg. His two feet formed a "T" shape, and it was clear that this was where he was injured. Erding is the only son of his 68-year-old father. His mother has passed away, and the two of them rely on planting a few acres of wasteland on the mountain and working odd jobs for the landlord to make a living. Since Erding was crippled by the American shell, the family situation has become even more miserable. They rely solely on his elderly father's labor, and they are always cold and hungry for several months of the year. Fortunately, last year the People's Liberation Army drove away the American devils' running dog, the Kuomintang reactionaries, and Erding and his father were allocated four and a half acres of dry land, which, together with their own mountain land, was enough to eat and wear. The only regret is Erding's disability, which often causes sadness to both father and son and resentment towards American imperialism. Erding's father, Yang Zhizhen, told me, "It would be so good if Erding could help me with something when he was healthy and strong. He could marry a wife, and they would be a family after I die. Now he can't do anything all day long. He was crippled by that damn American shell. We will never forget this feud with the American devils for generations to come." Erding said, "American devils, they are the ones who ruined my life. Now they want to invade our country again. If I weren't crippled, I would go to the front line and kill a few more of them to vent my hatred."

　　Ma Xiaowu was killed by another shell on the mountainside that blew off his head. His father didn't find his body until the next day. Since then, Xiaowu's mother became seriously ill and died from a combination of anxiety and anger. Xiaowu's father, Ma Shun, developed a trembling condition. He told me that all these misfortunes were given to him by the American soldiers, and he hated the American devils to the core. He said that as long as he had the opportunity, he would definitely take revenge. His son cannot die in vain.

　　In a small house with a stone wall on the mountainside, I found Shen Dazhuangzi, who was injured along with Erding. His injury was lighter than Erding's, and he didn't look crippled on the surface, but he couldn't do heavy work. He said, "Now, we can only produce well and support our Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army to resist American aggression and aid Korea, and defeat the American devils to avenge this."

　　Li Laotai (Old Lady Li), the mother of the two brothers Li Xiaoliu and Li Xiaomazi who were killed, painfully recalled the tragic situation at the time: "When I heard that my two sons were killed by American shells, my eyes went red. I stopped the American car and wanted to climb up and fight the American devils, but the car was driving too fast and threw me down, almost crushing me to death. Since then, I lived in a crazy state for more than a year, and I only slowly recovered after liberation..." Finally, she wiped her tears and gritted her teeth and said, "I hate the American devils to the core. I just can't touch them. If I could touch them, I would beat them to death, or bite them a few times."

　　京郊黑山扈村的血迹
    ·丁紫·
    美帝兽军到过那里，那里就留下惨痛的血迹！
    黑山扈村是北京西郊距城二十五里的一个村庄，村里住着贫穷的农民。村的西北有个小山头，人们叫它做“黑山头”，山巅耸立着无数的青山石，山腰里有数百年来勤劳农民开垦成的梯田，此外还有数十间土房子，里面住着世代贫苦的农民和石匠。
    黑山头——那是曾被日、美帝国主义蹂躏过的地方，只要提起它，那里的老百姓就要切齿愤怒的。住在那里的人们，曾经过多少的灾难啊！他们总不会忘记：美帝国主义盘据在北京的时候，三天两头排着队伍，开着车子，带着武装，耀武扬威地到黑山扈村来作实弹演习。黑山头便是他们射击的目标。附近的老百姓，吃尽了他们的苦头，炮声震坏了他们的土房顶棚、窗户纸、玻璃，炸药毁坏了他们的庄稼。最倒霉的要算在黑山头半山上居住的人们了，每逢美国鬼子打靶的时候，就得黑着天吃早饭，还没等吃完，美国鬼子就把他们撵走了。他们只好扶老携幼，离家远远地跑到山沟里去蹲一天，地里活一点也不能做，直到掌灯时才能回家。假如碰到刮风下雨的天气，那就更要受罪，冬天混身冻的都是疮。收成较好的年头，可以带两块干粮去避炮弹，遇到灾年，就是两顿菜粥也要相隔十一、二个小时才能吃得上。
    一九四七年三月三十一日的上午，驻在北京的美帝海军陆战队第五团，又闯进黑山扈村开始实弹演习；事先并没有通知当地村民，在演习地区也没有警戒，那些未爆炸的炮弹，也任意到处抛掷。那天下午四点多钟，炮声不响了，村里贫穷的儿童们三三两两的都走到美军射击地来了，他们想拣点杂和菜和碎弹皮。美军在那里演习时吃剩下丢在地上的罐头、饼干、面包、糖果等，便成了那里贫穷老百姓的珍品；那些碎弹皮，也可拣去卖几个零钱。孩子们中有个叫袁文兴的，碰到一个美国兵，手里拿着一个炮弹，向他叱声叫唤：“你买这个炮弹不？”袁文兴说：“碎弹皮一百元一斤，没炸的不要。”那美兵一定要卖给他。美国兵开够了心，大笑一声后，随手把炮弹扔到那里不管了。一会儿，村童李小六和他七岁的弟弟李小麻子还有刘小元三人跑到那颗炮弹处看，突然炮弹爆炸了，三个可怜的孩子就这么葬送了他们的生命。距炮弹一丈远的地方，蹲着三个正在下棋玩的小孩，他们名叫杨二丁、沈大庄子和宋启有，也无辜的受了重伤。在这同时，另一颗炮弹也爆炸了，又夺去了一个天真的孩子马小五的性命。
    前几天我去访问了这些不幸的受害人和他们的家属。在黑山头的山脚，苇草挡满了的围墙里，找到了杨二丁。首先引起人注意的便是他那两只细得可怕的腿，再往下看就是那一只踝骨突出的脚，横摆在腿下，两只脚成了“丁”字形，一看就知道那便是受伤的所在。二丁是他六十八岁父亲的独生子，母亲死去了，爷俩就靠着种山上开的几亩荒地和给地主打短工过日子。自从二丁被美军炮弹炸成残废后，家境就更惨了，只靠他老父亲一人劳动，一年之中总有几个月是饥寒交迫的。幸亏去年解放军赶跑了美国鬼子的走狗国民党反动派，二丁父子分到了四亩半旱地，连上自己的山地，也够的上吃穿了。美中不足的仍是二丁的残废，经常引起父子两个的伤心和对美帝的愤恨。二丁的父亲杨志珍对我说：“二丁好手好脚的帮我干点什么多好，娶个媳妇，赶明儿我死了，他们又是一家人家，现在整天干不了什么，好没影的被他妈的美国炮弹炸残废了，美国鬼子这仇，我们世世代代都不会忘的。”二丁说：“美国鬼子，就是他们害了我这一辈子，现在他们又要来侵略我国，我若不是残废了，非上前线去多打死它几个不解恨。”
    马小五是被半山上的另一颗炮弹炸没了头，直到第二天才被他的父亲把尸身找回了。从此以后，小五的母亲连急带气的就得了重病死去了。小五的父亲马顺落了个哆嗦的病根。他告诉我，这些不幸都是美国兵给他的，他恨透了美国鬼子。他表示，只要有机会，他一定要报仇，他的儿子不能白死。
    在半山碎石围墙的小屋里，我找到了和二丁一起受伤的沈大庄子。他的伤比二丁的轻些，表面上看不出是个残废，但却干不了重活。他说：“现在，我们只有好好生产，支援我抗美援朝志愿部队和朝鲜人民军，打垮美国鬼子，来报这个仇。”
    被炸死的李小六和李小麻子哥俩的母亲——李老太太，向我悲痛地追述着当时的惨况：“当我听说我两个儿子都被美国炮弹炸死的时候，我真眼红了，我截住美国汽车想爬上去和美国鬼子拼了，车开的太快，又把我甩了下来，差点没轧死我。从此，我疯疯癫癫地过了一年多，解放后我才慢慢好了……”最后，她擦了眼泪咬牙切齿地说：“我恨透了美国鬼子，就是摸不着他，若是摸着他，我打不死他，也要咬他几口。”
