　　Labor Model Movement and Labor Model Conference
    Agricultural Administration Department of the Central Ministry of Agriculture

The scale of production movement achievements is closely related to the extent to which the labor model movement is carried out extensively and in depth. The overfulfillment of this year's agricultural production plan is also inseparable from the emergence of a large number of labor models on the agricultural production front in various regions. In the spring of this year, Northeast China had 40,000 to 50,000 labor models on the agricultural production front. In different regions and different production tasks, they led or influenced the surrounding farmers with their exemplary actions, organized intensive cultivation, overcame difficulties, and conquered disasters, achieving the goal of increased production. Shanxi, Hebei, Pingyuan, Shandong, and other places carried out mass-based appraisal movements during the production process, conducting timely appraisals, summaries, commendations, and rewards based on the season, which greatly encouraged the production enthusiasm of the vast number of farmers and powerfully promoted the advancement of the production movement. A large number of labor models and production experts emerged. For example, in Handan Prefecture, Hebei Province, 3,347 villages widely launched a "compare crops to find out the reasons why" movement in August and September. In 854 villages in Quzhou, Qiu County, Yongnian, Wei County, Handan, and other five counties, a total of 1,910 production models of various types were selected. In Daming, 445 villages selected more than 1,100 male and female production models. In Pingyuan's Lin County alone, more than 10,000 male and female labor models were selected (accounting for 2.5% of the county's total population). Shanxi widely launched a mass-line democratic summary of production and labor model selection movement in the autumn. Wu Xiang selected seven villages that led production well and established them as banners for rural production leadership. Through this movement, Tunliu Jiaochuan made the masses realize that organizing and improving technology is the path to prosperity. Other places such as Chahar, Northern Jiangsu, and Northern Anhui also saw the emergence of many labor models and production experts in the production processes such as spring plowing, summer harvesting, river management, pest control, production, and disaster relief. These facts prove that combining the production process and carrying out timely mass-based appraisal movements is a successful mass-line leadership method for discovering and cultivating labor models, summarizing production experience, improving leadership, publicizing production policies, inspiring farmers' production enthusiasm, and promoting the current production movement. It also shows that where the labor model movement is carried out well, the cadres' leadership in the production movement is vivid and powerful, and the phenomena of coercion and commandism or laissez-faire are overcome.

The Central People's Government convened the National Congress of Labor Models of Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers on the eve of National Day. Now, provinces and regions are holding or preparing to hold provincial-level labor model conferences. It is entirely appropriate for these heroes on the production front, the backbones, bridges, and leading models who promote the victorious advancement of the cause of agricultural production recovery and development, to receive national honor, government commendation, and people's respect.

The labor model conferences currently being held or being prepared in various places are a summary of this year's labor model movement and also the beginning of a larger-scale labor model movement next year. Next year's labor model movement will be carried out more extensively and in depth on this new foundation and under the new conditions of next year. Undoubtedly, more and more outstanding labor models will emerge on various production fronts next year, creating greater and more amazing heroic deeds. Therefore, this conference will be a summary of the labor model movement and also a mobilization meeting for the labor model movement. Therefore, how to hold the labor model conference well has become a very important task at present. On the one hand, we must be good at summarizing the new and successful experiences of carrying out the labor model movement in various places over the past year, and on the other hand, we must be good at creating new conditions for the development of the labor model movement next year through this labor model conference.

First of all, we must treat the labor model conference with a serious attitude, not with a formalistic attitude of holding a meeting for the sake of holding a meeting or commending for the sake of commending, but for the wide-ranging development of the production movement next year, for striving for a greater harvest next year, and for establishing a model of progress for the vast number of working farmers in the new society, and establishing a banner of labor glory and production to get rich. Through such a conference format, it can encourage thousands of labor farmers to learn from them, follow their example, and lead the masses to advance towards the goal of restoring and developing production. Therefore, labor models should not only feel that labor is glorious and being a model is glorious, but also feel the importance of their own tasks, take a step forward in political understanding, receive encouragement and entrustment from society, and return to their posts with full enthusiasm but without pride, shouldering the task of organizing and leading the masses to advance.

Secondly, conscientiously summarize the experiences and creations of labor models. We must not only summarize their existing achievements, but more importantly, summarize the reasons why they have become labor models, and analyze them based on their subjective efforts and objective conditions to find out the general rules. In this way, on the one hand, labor models can become more enlightened model figures; on the other hand, we can also tell the leaders in various places how to educate cadres and the masses through these vivid examples in the future and cultivate thousands of labor models. Therefore, we must focus on summarizing the basic production problems of the local masses, select the experiences that the masses can achieve and draw conclusions from them, so as to formulate specific and practical plans to improve agricultural production at the current stage and promote them. This of course relies on regular investigation and research work before the meeting, and more importantly, in-depth research and summary with the labor models at the meeting to gather the wisdom of the masses. Only in this way can the leaders at all levels know what to do when leading the masses in production, know more clearly on what basis the production next year should be improved, the government's call can be vivid and powerful, and the government's production increase plan can become the actual actions of the vast masses.

Third, commend and reward based on facts. The achievements of labor models should be commended, and the merits of labor models should be rewarded. This is certain. However, the commendation of achievements must be based on facts, without any exaggeration, otherwise it will alienate the labor models from the masses and the leaders from the masses. The reward for the merits of labor models must also be based on facts, and give honorary or material rewards based on the size of his contribution to production and the depth of his influence on the masses. Material rewards should take into account both the collective and the individual, both this year and next year, the production needs of individuals and groups, and the possible impact on the masses. Special attention should be paid to preventing the growth of individual heroism due to excessive material rewards.

Finally, warm and sincere hospitality and care are also one of the important conditions for holding a good labor model conference. This is a concrete manifestation of the attitude of the staff of the People's Government towards the working people. We must make the labor models feel as warm as if they were at home and that they are truly the masters of the country, so as to personally experience the major changes in this society. All of this is political work, not administrative work. The people who participate in the labor model conference should consciously fulfill the responsibilities of public servants of the people rather than superiors, so that the labor models dare to speak, dare to raise opinions, humbly listen to their opinions, and earnestly answer and solve their problems, so as to establish a deeper connection between them and the government. And establish a close friendly relationship with working comrades. In this way, if he encounters any difficulties or discovers any problems in production in the future, he will quickly tell the government and ask the government to help him come up with ideas, so that the People's Government can establish contact with the masses more widely and more frequently!

In short, the labor model movement and labor model conference are very important from the perspective of restoring and developing production. From the perspective of improving leadership style, it is also a new leadership method of coming from the masses and going to the masses. How to earnestly summarize the experience of this year's labor model movement and hold the labor model conference well is already an important and practical topic at present.

　　劳模运动和劳模会议
    中央农业部农政司
    生产运动成绩的大小，和劳模运动开展的是否广泛深入有着密切的关系；今年农业增产计划的超额完成，亦和各地在农业生产战线上涌现大批的劳动模范的事实分不开的。东北在今年春天农业生产战线上就有四五万劳动模范，在各个不同的地区和各个不同的生产工作上，以自己的模范行动领导或影响周围的农民群众，组织起来精耕细作，克服困难，战胜灾害，达到了增产的目的。山西、河北、平原、山东等地在生产过程中开展了群众性的评比运动，根据季节及时评比及时总结及时表扬奖励，大大鼓舞了广大农民生产情绪，有力的推动了生产运动的前进，亦涌现大批的劳动模范生产能手，如河北邯郸专区三千三百四十七村，于八、九月间在比出庄稼好坏找出原因何在的口号下，广泛展开比庄稼运动，在曲周、邱县、永年、魏县、邯郸等五个县八百五十四个村，共选出各种生产模范一千九百一十人。大名四百四十五个村共选出男女生产模范一千一百多人。平原林县一县就评选出男女劳模万余人（占该县总人数的百分之二点五）。山西各地在秋季普遍开展群众路线的民主总结生产评选劳模运动，武乡选出七个领导生产好的村树立了农村领导生产的旗帜，屯留交川通过这一运动，使群众认识了组织起来提高技术是发家致富的道路。其他如察哈尔、苏北、皖北等地，在春耕夏收治河除虫生产救灾等生产过程中亦曾涌现了很多的劳动模范，生产能手。这些事实证明，结合生产过程，及时开展群众性的评比运动，是发现劳模，培养劳模，是总结生产经验改进领导，宣传生产政策，启发农民生产情绪，推动当前生产运动的一种成功的群众路线的领导方法。同时也说明了，那里劳模运动开展的好，那里的干部在生产运动的领导上，就表现得生动有力，而强迫命令，或放任自流的现象，也被克服了。
    今年中央人民政府在国庆的前夕，召开了全国的工农兵劳动模范代表会议，现在各省区正在或准备召开全省区的劳动模范会议。使这些生产战线上的功臣，推动农业生产的恢复与发展事业胜利前进的骨干、桥梁和带头的模范人物们受到国家的荣誉，政府的表扬，人民的尊崇是完全应该的。
    目前各地正在或准备召开的劳模会议，是今年劳模运动的总结，也是明年更大规模的劳模运动的开始，明年的劳模运动将会在这个新的基础上，明年的新的条件下，更广泛更深入的开展起来。明年无疑的将会在各个生产的战线上，涌现出更多的更出色的劳动模范，创造出更大的更惊人的英雄事迹来。所以说这个会将是个劳模运动的总结会，又是个劳模运动的动员会，因此如何开好劳模会，便成为了目前很重要的一项工作，一方面要善于总结一年来各地开展劳模运动的新的成功的经验，又要善于通过这次劳模会，创造好明年劳模运动开展的新的条件。
    首先要以严肃认真的态度对待劳模会议，不是为开会而开会，为表扬而表扬的形式主义的态度，而是为了明年的生产运动的广泛开展；为了争取明年更大的丰收；为了给广大的劳动农民在新社会树立前进的榜样，树立劳动光荣生产致富的旗帜。通过这样的会议形式，更能鼓励着千千万万的劳动农民向他们学习，向他们看齐，领导群众向着恢复与发展生产的目标前进；因之要使劳模们，不仅感到劳动光荣，模范光荣，也要感到自己任务的重大，从政治的认识上提高一步，社会上受到鼓励亦受到委托，情绪饱满但不骄傲地回到自己的岗位上，担负起组织群众，率领群众前进的任务来。
    其次认真地总结劳模经验和创造，不仅要总结他的现有的成绩，更重要的是总结出他之成为劳模的原因所在，根据着他主观的努力和客观的条件，加以分析，找出一般的规律，这样一方面可使劳模成为更觉悟的模范人物；另一方面亦告诉各地领导上，今后如何通过这些活生生的实例来教育干部、教育群众，培养出千千万万的劳动模范来，因此就要有重点地总结当地群众生产的基本问题，选择出群众可以作到的经验作出结论，从而定出在现阶段把农业生产提高一步的具体切实的方案来加以推广。这个当然依靠着开会前的经常的调查研究工作，更要在会议上集思广益地和劳模们深入研究与总结，只有这样才能使各级领导机关在领导群众生产时心中有数，更清楚地知道明年的生产应在什么基础上提高一步；政府的号召才能生动有力；才能使政府的增产计划变成广大的群众的实际行动。
    第三，实事求是的表扬与奖励。劳模的成绩应该表扬，劳模的功劳应该奖励，这是肯定的；但是对成绩的表扬，必须实事求是，不要有任何夸大，否则就会使劳模脱离群众，领导脱离群众。对劳模的功绩的奖励，亦必须实事求是，根据他对生产的贡献大小，对群众影响的深浅，而给以名誉的或物质的奖励；而物质的奖励应该既照顾到团体又照顾到个人，既照顾今年亦要照顾到明年，照顾个人和团体的生产需要，以及在群众中可能发生的影响，特别应注意防止因过重的物质奖励而助长个人英雄主义思想的滋长。
    最后就是热情诚恳地招待和关心，亦是开好劳模会的重要条件之一。这是人民政府工作人员对待劳动人民态度的具体表现，一定要使劳模们感到开会如同到了自己的家里一样温暖，自己真的是国家主人翁，从而亲身体会到这个社会的重大变革。这一切都是政治工作，而不是事务工作，参加劳模会工作的人们，要自觉地履行着人民勤务员而不是上级的职责，使劳模们有话敢说，有意见敢提，虚心地倾听他们的意见，认真地答复解决他们的问题，这样建立他们和政府更深切的连系。和工作同志建立起密切的友谊关系。这样，以后他在生产中遇到什么困难，发现什么问题，就会很快地告诉政府，请政府帮助出主意，这样人民政府才能更广泛地更经常地和群众建立起联系来！
    总之，劳模运动和劳模会议，从恢复与发展生产中来看是十分重要的，从改善领导作风上来看，也是一个新的从群众中来到群众中去的领导方法，如何认真的总结今年劳模运动的经验，开好劳模会议，已是当前重要而实际的课题。
