Supporting the Soviet Union, Opposing American Aggression!
    Railway Workers in the Jilin Area Intensify Production
    As a Gift for the Soviet October Revolution Anniversary
    [Report from this newspaper] Railway workers under the Jilin Railway Administration are strengthening their work to celebrate the great October Revolution Anniversary. Since liberation in this area, workers have modestly learned from the Soviet Union's advanced experience, which has improved work efficiency and labor conditions. The vast majority of workers have developed an unbreakable and deep friendship with the Soviet Union. Since the implementation of the new railway maintenance method in the Jilin Railway Bureau, the full screening work rate has increased from 5.39 meters to 8.3 meters. The non-screening rate has increased from 8.3 meters to 14.4 meters. The sand ballast work rate has also increased from 13.5 meters to 25.8 meters. Therefore, the entire bureau completed the task assigned by the Special Commissioner's Office seven and a half days ahead of schedule. The track quality reached 63%, reaching a good level or above. After learning the new shunting method, Zhang Wanshun, the Northeast Railway's Second-Class Hero shunting team, completed a train marshalling in 26 minutes, which is ten minutes shorter than the bureau's standard. This shortened the station's stop time from ten hours to seven and a half hours. Since implementing the new maintenance method and collective contracts, the Jilin Telecommunications Section has won the red flag six times in a row (April - September) in the competition among the seven telecommunications sections within its jurisdiction. The trade union was also elected as a model trade union. When awarding the prize, Wang Hanwen, chairman of the trade union, said, "This should be attributed to the help of the Soviet elder brother and the efforts of the workers."
    Since American imperialism launched the war of aggression against Korea and repeatedly violated our airspace and territorial waters, the workers have witnessed the brutal acts of American imperialism and have seen the Soviet Union's efforts for justice in the United Nations for lasting world peace. As the great October Revolution Anniversary is approaching, the workers are working even harder to produce. The workers of the hero Liu Hongren team, who created the highest record for anti-creeping devices, held up their iron hammers and said, "Every drop of sweat is a force. No matter how crazy you American imperialists are, you can't resist our hammering!" The output of their team has recently increased from 180 sets per day to 280 sets. The Jilin Train Section proposed to achieve 500 accident-free days by November 5th, and the Tonghua Inspection Section proposed to complete 150 accident-free days by November 3rd as a gift to welcome the October Revolution Anniversary. The Jilin Inspection Section completed the entire month's task on October 27th and exceeded it by 12% by the end of the month. In addition, it revived three dead cars.

　　拥护苏联，反对美国侵略！
    吉林区铁路职工加紧生产
    为苏联十月革命节作献礼
    【本报讯】吉林铁路管内职工加强工作庆祝伟大的十月革命节。该地区解放后，由于职工虚心地学习了苏联的先进经验，提高了工作效率，改善了劳动条件，广大职工对苏联已产生了牢不可破的深厚友情。吉林全局自实行新养路法后，全筛工率已由五点三九公尺提高到八点三公尺。不筛率由八点三公尺提高到十四点四公尺。砂子道床工率也由十三点五公尺提高到二十五点八公尺。所以全局提前七天半完成了特派员办事处所给予的任务。线路质量作到百分之六十三，达到良好程度以上。东北铁路二等英雄张万顺调车组学习了新调车法后，以二十六分钟就编成一列车，比局定标准缩短十分钟。这样就使全站的停站时间由十小时缩短到七点五小时。吉林电务段自推行新维修法和集体合同后，在管内的七个电务段的竞赛中，连获六次红旗（四月——九月）。工会也当选了模范工会。在发奖时，工会主席王汉文说：“这应当归功于苏联老大哥的帮助和工友们的努力。”
    美帝发动侵朝战争及屡次犯我领空、领海以来，工友们目睹美帝的残暴行为，又看到苏联为了世界持久和平，在联合国为正义而做的努力，在伟大十月革命节即将到来的前夕，职工们更百倍努力生产。创造防爬器最高纪录的英雄刘洪仁小组工友，高举着铁锤说：“一粒汗珠，就是一份力量，不管你美帝如何疯狂，也架不住咱们的锤打！”他们组的产量，最近又由每日打一百八十组提高到二百八十组。吉林列车段提出至十一月五日达成五百日无事故，通化检车段提出到十一月三日完成一百五十日无事故计划，作为迎接十月革命节的献礼。吉林检车段在十月二十七日完成了全月任务，到月末超过百分之十二。此外还复活了三台死车。
