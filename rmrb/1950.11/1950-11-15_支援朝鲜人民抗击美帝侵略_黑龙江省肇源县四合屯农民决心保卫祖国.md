    After hearing that the American beasts had turned Korea into a living hell and repeatedly violated our country's airspace, the labor model Wang Zhentang group of Sihetun, Seventh District, Zhaoyuan County, Heilongjiang Province, held a symposium for all men and women, young and old, in the village on the evening of October 25th.
    At the beginning, labor model Wang Zhentang first said to everyone: "We suffered fourteen years of oppression from the Japanese devils in the past: grabbing laborers, demanding corvée, with nothing left in our homes, unable to eat or wear clothes, and even the old women had no pants. We have just turned ourselves around, and under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, our lives are getting better day by day. The hateful American devils are here to make trouble for us again. We must resolutely fight them!" At the same time, he said with full confidence: "I was in Beijing for a meeting and caught up with National Day. Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu reviewed the troops, with the air force, navy, and army, inspecting for a whole day. There were so many cannons and planes! With these powerful national defense forces, we are definitely not afraid of them!" Then he continued: "We must bring out the spirit of 1947, combine it with the current production base, and do a good job in war preparedness. The money earned from production should be used to support the Korean people in resisting American aggressors!" His words were unanimously approved by everyone. Zhang Guanghe also added to it with victorious confidence: "When the Eighth Route Army was first established, their weapons were not good, but they still beat the devils to a pulp; now we have more than five million powerful national defense forces, as well as airplanes and cannons, so we are even less afraid of them! We have a large population and great strength, we can't just watch them go crazy, we must fight them!"
    When it came to the fact that the American imperialists had turned Korea into a living hell, the villagers stomped their feet in anger. Old Zhang, who was over fifty years old, said: "We must not let the American devils prosper, those bad guys will come over, we won't be able to find a good life. Although I am a cripple and cannot go to Korea, I harvested more than a thousand catties of yellow tobacco this year, and I will sell some to support the Korean people." Zhang Shuzhen, the director of the women's association, said angrily: "I heard that the American devils in Korea are gambling with women, my heart is like a knife, I wish I could grab them and avenge the Korean sisters." As she spoke, tears welled up in her eyes. She gritted her teeth and said: "I will definitely organize the women to make cotton clothes, shoes, and socks to send to Korea. We must also do a good job in women's winter sideline occupations and use practical actions to support the Korean people." At this point, everyone expressed their anger and determination to defeat the American devils.
    Finally, everyone asked to go to Korea to carry stretchers. Wang Cai said: "I will go with both my person and my horse!" Labor model Wang Zhentang, Yu Changjiang, Sun Baifa and others volunteered to make cotton clothes to support the resistance against American aggression.
    After the meeting, the women sent dried vegetables to the village government one after another. Zhang Sunshi walked along with the dried vegetables, saying: "I will send more dried vegetables to let the soldiers on the Korean battlefield have enough to eat, so they can eliminate the American devils." Now, Wang Zhentang can't sleep every night, and organizes threshing early and late. The group members are also working with great enthusiasm.
    Wang Zhentang's group has 213 *qing* 4 *mu* and 5 *fen* of land, and this year's crops are growing particularly well. Combined with sideline fishing, the group estimates that it can harvest at least 1,150 *shi* of grain this year, and the sideline occupation can earn about 700 million (Northeast currency). The whole group and the farmers in the whole village have the same wish: to produce more grain, do a good job in sideline occupations, to support the Korean people, defeat the American devils, and defend the beautiful life of the Korean and Chinese people and the rivers and mountains of the motherland.

　　支援朝鲜人民抗击美帝侵略
    黑龙江省肇源县四合屯农民决心保卫祖国
　　王振堂　尚原　于永学
    黑龙江省肇源县七区四合屯劳模王振堂组，在听到美国野兽们把朝鲜变成了活地狱，并三番五次地侵犯我国领空以后，在十月二十五日晚，召开了全屯男女老少座谈会。
    一开始，劳模王振堂首先向大家说：“咱们过去受了日本鬼子十四年的压迫：抓劳工，要出荷，家里糟的啥也没有，吃不上穿不上，老娘们连裤子都没有。刚刚翻了身，在毛主席、共产党英明领导下，日子一天比一天上升了。可恨美国鬼子又来和我们捣乱。咱们要坚决地和他拚一拚！”他同时又满怀信心地说：“我在北京开会正赶上国庆日。毛主席、朱总司令阅兵，又有空军，又有海军、陆军，整整检阅了一天。大炮、飞机可老鼻子啦！咱们有这些强大国防军，决不怕它！”然后接着说：“咱们一定要把一九四七年的精神拿出来，结合现在的生产基础，把备战工作搞好。由生产得来的钱，要多多支援朝鲜人民抗击美国侵略者！”他的话得到了大家一致的赞同。张广和还以胜利的信心给他作补充：“从前八路军刚成立的时候，武器不好，都把鬼子打得落花流水；现在咱们有五百多万强大的国防军，还有飞机大炮啥的，更不怕它啦！咱们人多力量大，不能眼看着它发疯，非和它拚拚不可！”
    谈到美帝把朝鲜造成了活地狱的时候，老乡们气得直跺脚。五十多岁的老张头说：“咱们一定不叫美国鬼子兴洋，那些坏家伙要过来，咱们算找不着好。我虽然是个瘸子，不能到朝鲜去，我今年收入了一千多斤黄烟，我要卖一部分来支援朝鲜人民。”妇女主任张淑珍愤恨地说：“我听说美国鬼子在朝鲜拿女人耍钱，我心象刀搅一样，恨不得一把抓住它们替朝鲜姊妹报仇。”她讲到这里，眼泪在眼圈里直转要落下来。她咬牙切齿地说：“我一定把妇女组织起来，做棉衣、鞋、袜送到朝鲜去。还要搞好妇女冬季副业，用实际行动来支援朝鲜人民。”谈到这儿，大伙都愤愤地表示非打败美国鬼子不可。
    最后，大伙都要求到朝鲜去抬担架。王财说：“我要连人带马都去！”劳模王振堂和于长江、孙百发等都自愿要做棉衣支援抵抗美国侵略。
    会后，妇女们纷纷向村政府送干菜。张孙氏拿着干菜一面走一面说：“我多送干菜叫朝鲜战场上的战士吃饱饭，好消灭美国鬼子。”现在，王振堂每晚上都睡不着觉，起早贪黑地组织打场。组员们也干得劲头挺高。
    王振堂组全组二百一十三垧四亩五分土地，今年庄稼长的特别好。结合搞副业打鱼，今年全组最低估计能打一千一百五十石粮，副业能收入七亿（东北币）左右。全组和全屯农民有着同一志愿：多打粮食，搞好副业，来支援朝鲜人民，打败美国鬼子，保卫朝鲜和中国人民的美好生活和祖国的江山。
