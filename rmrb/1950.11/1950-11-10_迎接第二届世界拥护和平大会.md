　　Welcoming the Second World Peace Congress

The Second World Peace Congress, to be held in November, will be a major milestone in the great and historic struggle of the people for peace. It will demonstrate the will of millions upon millions of people and their unwavering determination to defeat the sinister plans of the warmongers. This is evident in the preparations currently being made by various countries for the congress.

In thousands of gatherings and mass rallies, all those who cherish the peace and security of all nations unanimously demand the abolition of the atomic bomb as a weapon of mass human extermination, the cessation of the arms race, the implementation of disarmament, and the condemnation of aggression. Hundreds of millions of people actively and resolutely express their will, demanding the cessation of the barbaric and hateful war propaganda currently being conducted by several capitalist countries, particularly the United States, the strengthening of the United Nations Organization as a weapon of peace, and the assurance of the right of all nations to determine their own destiny. They demand the resolution of armed conflicts by peaceful means and the establishment of normal economic and cultural exchanges between nations.

The Preparatory Committee of the World Peace Congress, meeting in Prague on October 5, summarized the results of its past work by stating: "The free people of the world, through the signing of the Stockholm Peace Appeal, have forced certain governments to expose their motives and cease using the atomic bomb." It is futile for the Achesons and Bevins to falsely claim that the signatures of hundreds of millions of people on the Stockholm Peace Appeal are insufficient to restrain their actions.

The imperialist gentlemen must assess the will of the hundreds of millions of people who have signed the Stockholm Peace Appeal. No matter how the American and British war propagandists argue, they cannot conceal the fact that four hundred million people have already condemned the war and are prepared to actively fight for peace.

The Preparatory Committee of the Second World Peace Congress justly points out that "what has already been accomplished by the unity of hundreds of millions of people can be even greater." The vital interests of all nations demand a deeper and broader struggle for peace.

At the current session of the United Nations General Assembly, the Soviet delegation proposed the adoption of a "Declaration on the Elimination of the Threat of a New War and the Strengthening of Peace and Security among Nations." This declaration includes clear and explicit proposals regarding the prohibition of propaganda for a new war, the abolition of the atomic bomb, the signing of an agreement by the United States, Britain, France, China, and the Soviet Union to strengthen peace, and the reduction of the military strength of the five powers to one-third of their 1950 level. These proposals constitute a great and noble plan for establishing stable peace throughout the world. They stem from the possibility of peaceful coexistence between the two systems and aim at seriously strengthening the United Nations Organization. However, this peace plan, which expresses the aspirations and prayers of all peace-loving people, the hopes and prayers of good people in all countries and continents, has been met with hostility by the American and British warmongers and their agents since its presentation by the Soviet delegation at the United Nations General Assembly.

The delegations of the Soviet Union, Ukraine, Byelorussia, Poland, and Czechoslovakia presented concrete proposals concerning the issue of Korean independence at the General Assembly for consideration. These proposals focused on the immediate cessation of combat operations, the immediate withdrawal of foreign troops from Korea, free universal elections, and the establishment of a unified Korean government. However, these proposals were rejected by those who conspire to undermine peace. Under the guise of the United Nations flag, the American war profiteers continue to mercilessly slaughter the peaceful people of Korea and relentlessly expand their operations, accelerating the transformation of Korea into a colony of American imperialism, a war base against the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, and against the colonial peoples who have risen up to fight for freedom and national independence. The bloody actions of American imperialism in Korea overwhelm the crimes of the Hitlerite gang. The American militarist clique has repeatedly provoked and seriously violated the borders of the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union. American aircraft first opened fire on Chinese villages and towns, and then opened fire on a Soviet airfield 100 kilometers from the Soviet-Korean border. This is the actual action that accompanies the exaggerated and completely false speeches of the Achesons, Austins, Jessups, and others in the United Nations General Assembly and Security Council.

In the United States and in countries under its control, the work of arms expansion continues furiously. This year, the United States' military expenditure is 62 billion US dollars. Military service periods have been extended in the United States and other Marshall Plan countries. West Germany is building an aggressive army. The sound of bombs exploding in Korea echoes the sound of grenades thrown by fascist assassins at selfless peace fighters everywhere. The Wall Street tycoons and their right-wing socialist servants are no longer satisfied with illegally throwing communists and democrats into their torture chambers. They want to deal with the defenders of peace and democracy with cowardly and thieving methods. Police freedom of action and robbery organized by the government—this is the leading "principle" of current imperialist politicians.

As early as sixteen years ago, when the German and Italian fascists united with Japanese militarists to actively prepare for their bloody adventure, Stalin's description of the imperialist aggressors rings as true today as it did then.

"The ruling classes of capitalist countries," Comrade Stalin said, are enthusiastically destroying or negating the last traces of parliamentary politics and bourgeois democracy that the working class may use in its struggle against oppressors. They are forcing communist parties everywhere underground and maintaining their dictatorship with open terror.

"Chauvinism and war preparations are the main factors in their foreign policy; suppression of the working class and terrorist policies are the inevitable methods for consolidating their rear for future wars—this is what current imperialist politicians are particularly concerned about.

"No wonder fascism has now become the most fashionable commodity among belligerent bourgeois politicians."

As everyone knows, this policy of imperialism brewed the Second World War. But the current situation is fundamentally different from that before the Second World War. At that time, there was only one country representing the forces of peace—the Soviet Union. Today, alongside the powerful Soviet Union, defending peace are the People's Republic of China, with a population accounting for a quarter of the world's total, and the People's Democracies and the German Democratic Republic. At that time, there were not many communist parties in capitalist countries that enjoyed the sympathy and support of broad sections of the people, but today there are, and neither cowardly assassinations nor fascist trials can eliminate them, because the broad masses of the people are following them. Finally, at that time—in 1939—there was no organized movement of peace supporters in the world. Today, this movement exists; it is acting, growing, and fighting, making the arms dealers who dream of plunging the world into a new pit of war tremble. Today, the forces of peace are far stronger than the forces of war!

The Preparatory Committee for the Second World Peace Congress, currently underway, will raise this movement to a new level. To safeguard peace, people of all professions—workers, farmers, handicraftsmen, scientists, writers, actors, missionaries, housewives, merchants, and industrialists—have united and will continue to unite. The unity of their will and action will form a force that deters war.

Naturally, communists stand at the forefront of this great movement. Communists are not afraid of the cruel repressive measures currently being implemented by imperialism. Communists will not be diverted from their path by the rumors and provocations of the Achesons, Bevins, Schumachers, and Kaders. Communists have strengthened and will continue to strengthen the unity among peace fighters, working together with all good people to ensure the great success of the Second World Peace Congress—this people's conference against warmongers and in support of world peace.

### 迎接第二届世界拥护和平大会

　　迎接第二届世界拥护和平大会
    将在十一月间举行的第二届世界和平大会将在人民为和平而进行的伟大的有历史意义的斗争中，成为一个重大的里程碑。它将表现千千万万人民的意志，及他们击败战争贩子的罪恶计划的百折不挠的决心。这在目前各国正为大会进行的准备工作中获得明证。
    在千百个集会和群众大会上，所有珍爱各国人民的和平及安全的人们都一致要求废止原子弹作为大规模灭绝人类的武器，停止军备竞争，实行裁军，斥责侵略。亿万人民积极地坚决地表示其意志，要求停止目前若干资本主义国家特别在美国所进行的野蛮、仇恨的战争宣传，加强联合国组织以之作为和平武器，并确保各国人民决定其自己命运的权利。他们要求用和平手段来解决武装冲突，并建立国际间正常的经济及文化的交流。
    世界拥护和平大会筹备委员会十月五日在布拉格开会时，总结其过去工作结果说：“全世界的自由人民由于斯德哥尔摩和平宣言的签名逼使若干政府暴露其动机，并停止使用原子弹。”艾奇逊们及贝文们伪称亿万人民在斯德哥尔摩和平宣言上的签名不足以约束他们行动，是徒然的。
    帝国主义者先生们得估量一下在斯德哥尔摩和平宣言上签了名的几亿人民的意志。无论美英战争宣传家怎样强词夺理，他们掩盖不住四亿人民已经谴责了战争，并且准备积极地为和平而战。
    第二届世界和平大会筹备委员会公正地指出“亿万人民的团结所已完成的，规模还可以更大”。各国人民的重大利益，要求进行一个更深入、更广泛的争取和平的斗争。
    在本届联合国全体大会上，苏联代表团曾建议采纳一个“消灭新的战争的威胁并加强各国和平及安全的宣言”。这个宣言包括关于禁止新的战争的宣传，废止原子弹，为了加强和平，美、英、法、中及苏联签立协定，照五强在一九五○年的军力减缩三分之一等清楚而明确的建议。这些建议是在全世界建立稳定和平的伟大而崇高的方案。它们是出发自两个制度可以和平相处的可能性，而以认真加强联合国组织为目的。但是这个和平方案，表达了所有爱好和平的人民的想望和祈求，各国各洲善良人民的希望和祈求的方案，由苏联代表团在联合国大会上提出后，却遭遇到美英战争贩子及其代理人的仇视。
    苏联、乌克兰、白俄罗斯、波兰及捷克代表团曾在大会上提出有关朝鲜独立问题的具体建议，交付考虑。这些建议着眼在战斗行为的立即停止，外国军队的立即撤出朝鲜，自由普选，和成立一个普遍性的朝鲜政府。但是这些建议都为阴谋破坏和平者所拒绝。在联合国旗帜的掩护下，美国战争贩子继续更加无情地残杀朝鲜的和平人民，并且有增无已地扩大其作战规模，加速地把朝鲜变成为一个美国帝国主义者的殖民地，变成为一个反苏联及中华人民共和国，反对起而为自由及国家独立而斗争的殖民地人民的战争基地。美国帝国主义在朝鲜的血腥行为压倒了希特勒匪帮的罪行。美国黩武集团一再挑衅，严重地侵犯了中华人民共和国及苏联的边界。美国飞机始而向中国村庄城镇开火，继而向距苏朝边界一百公里的苏联飞机场开火。这就是伴随着艾奇逊们，奥斯汀们，杰伯们等在联合国大会及安全理事会上那些夸张，完全虚伪演词的实际行动。
    在美国及在其控制之下的国家里，扩军的工作仍在狂烈地继续着。今年，美国的军事支出是六二○亿美元。军役期在美国及其他马歇尔计划的国家中都延长了。西德正在建立着一支侵略性的军队。炸弹在朝鲜的爆炸声是和法西斯刺客们在各地投向无私的和平斗士的手榴弹爆炸声互相应和。华尔街大亨们及其右翼社会党的仆从们不再满足于非法地把共产党员及民主人士投入其酷刑室。他们要以卑怯的强盗般的办法来对付和平民主的保卫者。由政府来主持的警察的自由行动及强盗行为——这就是当前帝国主义政客们的主导“原则”。
    早在十六年前，当德、意法西斯联合日本军人积极准备其血腥的冒险时，斯大林对帝国主义侵略者的描写，今日想来，其真实不减往昔。
    “资本主义国家的统治阶级”，斯大林同志说，正热衷于破毁或否定着工人阶级在反对压迫者的斗争中可能使用的议会政治及资产阶级民主制度的最后踪迹，它们正把各地共产党逼入地下，并用公开恐怖方法来维系其独裁地位。
    “沙文主义及备战是其外交政策的主要因素；压制工人阶级及恐怖政策为其国内政策，这是为了未来战争而巩固其后方的必然方法——这正是当前帝国主义政客们心目中特别关怀着的。
    “难怪法西斯主义如今已成为好战的资产阶级政客间最时髦的商品了。”
    众所周知，帝国主义的这一政策酿成了第二次世界大战。但目前的形势与第二次世界大战前根本不同了。那时，代表和平势力的仅有一国——苏联。今日，与强大的苏联并肩保卫和平的，有人口占全世界四分之一的中华人民共和国，和人民民主国家及德意志民主共和国。那时，资本主义国家中还没有许多享有广大阶层人民的同情及支持的共产党，今天却有了，而且不论是卑鄙的狙击或法西斯的审判都无法消灭它们，因为广大人民群众是追随着它们的。最后，在那时——即一九三九年——世界上还不存在有组织的和平拥护者的运动。今日，这个运动存在了；它在行动着，生长着，战斗着，使那些梦想把世界陷入新的战争的坑阱中的军火贩子发抖了。今日，和平的力量远强大于战争的力量！
    目前正在进行中的第二届世界拥护和平大会筹委会将把这个运动提高到新的水平。为了保障和平，各种从业的人民——工人，农民，手工业工人，科学家，作家，演员，传教士，家庭妇女，商人及工业家——已经团结在一起了，并且将继续团结起来。他们意志与行动的团结将形成阻遏战争的力量。
    很自然地共产党员是站在这个伟大运动的前列。共产党人不怕目前帝国主义所施行的残酷压迫手段。共产党人不因艾奇逊们，贝文们，舒马赫们，卡德尔们的造谣挑衅而转移他们的道路。共产党人已经加强并将继续加强和平斗士间的团结，与所有善良的人们共同努力，使第二届世界拥护和平大会——这个反对战争贩子，拥护世界和平的人民会议获得伟大的成功。
