Overseas Chinese Students in Beijing Issue Declaration
    Calling on Overseas Chinese Youth to Rise Up Against America
    Over 200 People Have Applied to Join the Volunteer Army and Donate Comfort Items
    [Report from this newspaper] Two hundred and eighty-five overseas Chinese students in Beijing, including Weng Naikang, have applied to join the Volunteer Army and donated a large number of items to express their sympathy to the Korean people and our volunteer troops. They also issued a declaration, expressing their warm support for the joint declaration of the various democratic parties, determined to contribute everything to resist America and aid Korea, protect the homeland and defend the country; and calling on overseas Chinese youth at home and abroad to unite and act against American imperialist aggression. The declaration, after listing the aggressive crimes of American imperialism, said: "We, the overseas Chinese youth students, love and look forward to the long-awaited new motherland, cherish our new lives, and in the past year, under the cultivation of internationalism and patriotism education, deeply feel that only by resolutely opposing the aggression of American imperialism at all costs and sacrifices can we defend the great construction cause of the motherland and defend world peace.
    Therefore, we firmly support the solemn declaration of the democratic parties on November 4, and are willing to inherit the anti-imperialist tradition of loving the motherland from our predecessors, and take practical actions to resist America and aid Korea, protect the homeland and defend the country. Before leaving our original posts, we are determined to actively study, work hard, and enthusiastically donate to support the Korean people and our volunteer troops to aid Korea.
    We hope that overseas Chinese youth in the motherland will unite and act to resist American imperialist aggression; we also hope that overseas youth and students will recognize the ferocious face of American imperialism, respond to the call of the motherland, and rise up for the sacred task of resisting America, aiding Korea, protecting the homeland and defending the country. The victory of the Korean people is the victory of the motherland, the victory of the liberation movement in all of Asia, and the victory of all peace-loving people in the world!"
    As of the 23rd, the items they donated included 46,519,595 yuan in cash, 52 pieces of various gold items and diamonds, 14 pieces of silverware, 3 cameras, 1 telescope, 11 pens, 6 watches, 496 pieces of clothing and quilts, 84 pieces of medicine, and 26 pieces of leather shoes, towels, toothbrushes, thermometers, fever needles, military kettles, military bags, and flashlights. Among them, Weng Naikang alone donated 11,746,645 yuan. At the same time, they also wrote many letters of sympathy to give spiritual support to the heroic Korean soldiers and Chinese volunteer troops.
