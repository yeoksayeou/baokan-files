Xinhua News Agency, dated 3rd: A comprehensive dispatch from TASS, New York: The United Nations General Assembly's Special Political Committee, which began discussing the relations between UN member states and specialized agencies with Franco's Spain on October 27th, concluded on October 31st.

Under the behind-the-scenes instigation of the United States, seven Latin American countries and the Philippines jointly proposed a resolution to rescind the 1946 UN General Assembly resolution barring Franco's Spain from participating in UN specialized agencies and recommending that member states withdraw their diplomatic envoys from Spain.

During the discussion, Soviet representative Tsarapkin pointed out that there was no justification for revoking the 1946 resolution at the present time, and that the UN should not be pushed down the road of condoning fascism. Tsarapkin revealed that this joint proposal was designed to satisfy the needs of the United States, which is attempting to incorporate Franco into its aggressive bloc.

Representatives of Poland, Ukraine, Belarus, and Czechoslovakia all opposed the joint proposal, citing facts to prove that the United States has colluded with Franco, and that the United States is attempting to turn Spain into a base for launching a new war.

Representatives from Uruguay, Guatemala, Mexico, and Israel also spoke against the joint proposal, pointing out that the situation in Spain has not changed since 1946, and it is still ruled by the Franco fascist regime. Therefore, there is no reason to revoke the UN General Assembly's 1946 resolution.

However, under the manipulation of the United States, the majority voting machine in the Special Political Committee ultimately passed the joint proposal. The Soviet Union, Belarus, Ukraine, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Guatemala, Israel, Mexico, Uruguay, and Yugoslavia voted against it. Australia, Burma, Cuba, Denmark, Abyssinia, France, India, Indonesia, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, and the United Kingdom abstained. The United States and 37 other countries voted in favor.

　　美国与佛朗哥勾结在一起
    联大特别政委会在美国操纵下撤销前联大关于西班牙的决议
    【新华社三日讯】综合塔斯社纽约讯：联合国大会特别政治委员会自十月二十七日起讨论联合国会员国及专门机构与佛朗哥西班牙的关系问题，已于十月三十一日结束。
    在美国幕后指使下，拉丁美洲七个国家及菲律宾联合提出提案，要求取消联合国大会一九四六年关于不准佛朗哥西班牙参加联合国专门机构以及建议各会员国撤回其驻西班牙的外交使节的决议。
    苏联代表查拉普金在讨论中指出：目前取消一九四六年的决议是毫无理由的，联合国不应被推向默许法西斯主义的路上去。查拉普金揭露这项联合提案是在满足美国的需要，美国正企图将佛朗哥纳入美国的侵略集团中去。
    波兰、乌克兰、白俄罗斯、捷克斯洛伐克代表均反对联合提案，列举事实证明美国已与佛朗哥勾结在一起，美国企图变西班牙为其发动新战争的基地。
    乌拉圭、危地马拉、墨西哥及以色列代表也发言反对联合提案，指出西班牙情况自一九四六年以来并无变化，仍为佛朗哥法西斯政权统治着，因此没有理由取消联大一九四六年的决议。
    但是在美国操纵下，特别政委会上的多数表决机器最后仍通过这项联合提案。苏联、白俄罗斯、乌克兰、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、危地马拉、以色列、墨西哥、乌拉圭及南斯拉夫十国投票反对，澳大利亚、缅甸、古巴、丹麦、阿比西尼亚、法国、印度、印尼、新西兰、挪威、瑞典及英国十二国弃权，美国等三十七国则投票赞成。
