　　Jiangxi Yongxin People
    Protest Against US Imperialist Aggression
    [This newspaper reported] Yongxin County, Jiangxi Province, is a county in the Xianggan Soviet base area that has undergone ten years of land revolution struggle. The local people are filled with righteous indignation at the US imperialist's arrogant crimes of aggression against Korea and our country's territory and airspace, and they have expressed that they will actively transport public grain and implement land reform and other practical actions to support Korea's patriotic war. People from all walks of life in the county held a current affairs symposium on the 6th of this month. The meeting unanimously agreed that in order to defend the motherland, it is necessary to support the joint declaration of the Chinese democratic parties, which pointed out that voluntary actions should be taken to actively and effectively assist Korea. Comrade Jie Qiang of the County Federation of Trade Unions said: "We must step up production, build our motherland, and volunteer to strongly support the Korean people's patriotic war. If the US imperialists dare to expand their aggression again, the workers of our entire county will immediately mobilize and organize to fight to the end to defeat US imperialist aggression!" Yan Zhenhuan, a member of the Youth League of the County Government Finance Committee, firmly stated: Do a good job in the autumn levy, prepare for land reform, strengthen learning, become proficient in business, and develop a high degree of internationalism. Wherever we are needed, we will go there! The County Government League Group also guaranteed to take the lead in various tasks. All faculty and staff of the Provincial Yongxin Middle School unanimously agreed to do a good job in the anti-US and aid-Korea propaganda, strengthen current affairs learning, further guide students in their studies, and go deep into the countryside to carry out current affairs propaganda, expose the US imperialists' conspiracies and crimes, arouse the masses' hatred of the US imperialists, and be a veritable new democratic educator. The comrades of the school's League branch and student union also said: "We must unite the vast number of young people to disregard all sacrifices and fight to defend the motherland and defeat all imperialist provocations." Wu Longkai, vice chairman of the County Farmers Association, loudly opposed US imperialist aggression and said: "Our farmers will deliver good public grain, step up land reform and winter cultivation, organize militia to protect local order, and, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, bravely advance to support the Korean War and defeat US imperialist aggression." All cadres of the County People's Court hated US imperialist aggression to the bone. They firmly stated that they would do a good job in judicial work, consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship, consolidate national defense, suppress counter-revolutionaries, and eliminate bandit and special agent activities. Li Xiaochun, director of the County People's Health Center and a Christian, expressed his hatred for the US imperialists' expansion of the war. He said: "Korea has a close relationship with us. If they win, we win. We must do our best to support the Korean War and defeat US imperialist aggression. We must also conduct in-depth and extensive propaganda and organize all Christian friends in Yongxin to fight for resisting US aggression and aiding Korea." All staff of the People's Bank of China expressed extreme indignation at the US imperialist aggression. They said: "We must step up our work to prosper the new democratic economy, and voluntarily contribute our greatest strength to support the Korean people." Ni Weide of the County People's Education Center expressed his hatred for the US imperialists' brutal killing of the Korean people and their insane bombing of peaceful cities and residents. He said: "I will unite all literary and art lovers in Yongxin County to do a good job in various anti-American propaganda activities, respond to the call of the National Federation of Literary and Art Circles, resist US aggression and aid Korea, and defend our homes and country." All staff of the Tax Bureau were extremely indignant at the US imperialist aggression and stated that in the future, they would conduct anti-US and aid-Korea propaganda to merchants at any time and any place to promote the patriotic spirit of merchants. Zhao Yinghua, a female teacher at the County No. 1 Elementary School, expressed her indignation at the US imperialists' expansion of the war and said: "We must strengthen education so that every student's mother recognizes the brutal crimes of the US imperialists." It was finally decided that the county would organize an anti-US and aid-Korea propaganda committee to unite all folk cultural and artistic workers to conduct in-depth and extensive propaganda on the US imperialists' conspiracy to invade Korea, so that every person in the county can support the Korean people's patriotic war on a voluntary basis.
