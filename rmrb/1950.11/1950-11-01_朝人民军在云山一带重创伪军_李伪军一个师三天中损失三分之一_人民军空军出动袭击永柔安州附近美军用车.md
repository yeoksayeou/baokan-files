Xinhua News Agency, 31st. The American aggressors and the Rhee Syngman puppet army are suffering increasing losses and difficulties due to the staunch resistance and forceful counterattacks of the Korean People's Army, coupled with unfavorable climate and terrain. On the line of Dingzhou, Taechon, Unsan and Heechon, the fierce counteroffensive of the Korean People's Army has caused serious losses to the enemy. According to a report by Associated Press reporter Ericson on the 30th, the 6th Division of the Rhee Syngman army in the Wenjing and Unsan areas was "forced to retreat in disarray" under the counterattack of the Korean People's Army. According to the Rhee Syngman military, "the 6th Division has lost nearly one-third of its personnel in the past three days of fighting."

Agence France-Presse, in reporting the People's Army's surprise attacks and the enemy's embarrassing situation, stated: "The North Korean troops who retreated after the South Korean troops recaptured Wenjing yesterday (28th) charged down the mountain this morning (29th) blowing bugles, clearing a section of the highway more than 20 kilometers long between Wenjing and Taiping. They captured 18 cannons and captured the headquarters of the South Korean Army's 8th Division at 4 am this morning. Walter, an American newsreel projectionist, spent the night in the headquarters and only had time to put on his pants and escape in a jeep with flat tires." Walker, commander of the U.S. Eighth Army, personally went to the front line by plane on the 29th to inspect the situation and had to admit that the situation of the "South Korean army near Unsan was difficult" (Pan Asia News Agency).

Reuters reported the difficulties faced by the British and Australian Allied forces in the Kasan area (west of Bochuan): "The fighting is taking place in the mountains." The Korean People's Army "has good fortifications on the high ground on both sides of the road, supported by tanks and automatic cannons." The report admitted that the Korean People's Army's "extremely fierce resistance" had "hindered the advance" of the British and Australian forces.

On the east coast, an Associated Press dispatch on the 29th acknowledged that the Korean People's Army was conducting "strong resistance and tenacious local battles" in the area. United Press reporter Chapman described the embarrassing situation of the Rhee Syngman army fighting in the area: "The Kyoto Division encountered a blizzard that buried the ridge in two to twelve inches of snow within hours. Many Korean soldiers were still wearing summer clothes and torn tennis shoes. Officers said: Progress is very slow." The reporter pessimistically said: "They are now fighting what appears to be a long-term war in a country where the temperature is dropping to minus 30 degrees."

TASS dispatch, 31st. The General Headquarters of the Korean People's Army of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea issued a war report on the 30th, stating that the People's Army troops continued to engage in fierce battles with the enemy on all fronts.

North of Hamhung, the People's Army troops continued to conduct tenacious defensive battles, hindering the enemy's advance.

On October 27th, the People's Army Air Force destroyed several American military trucks near Yongyu and Anju.

In other areas of the front, fierce defensive battles are still continuing.

　　朝人民军在云山一带重创伪军
    李伪军一个师三天中损失三分之一
    人民军空军出动袭击永柔安州附近美军用车
    【新华社三十一日讯】美国侵略者和李承晚伪军在朝鲜人民军的坚强抵抗和有力反击下，加上气候和地形的不利条件，损失愈来愈大，困难愈来愈多。在定州、泰川、云山、熙川一线上，朝鲜人民军的猛烈反攻，已使敌军遭到严重损失。据美联社记者艾里克森三十日报道：温井和云山地区的李承晚军第六师在朝鲜人民军的反攻下，“被迫散乱退却”。据李承晚军方估计，“第六师在过去三天的战斗中，已损失兵员近三分之一”。
    法新社在报道人民军的奇袭及敌军的狼狈情况称：“昨天（二十八日）在南朝鲜部队克复温井后即行撤退的北朝鲜部队，今日（二十九日）拂晓吹着号声冲下山来，肃清了温井与太平之间二十公里以上的一段公路，他们夺获大炮十八门，并于今晨四时攻克南朝鲜军第八师的司令部。美国新闻影片放映员华特适在司令部内度夜，这时仅能来得及穿上裤子，乘一辆轮胎都没有了气的吉普逃走。”美第八军军长瓦克为此曾于二十九日乘飞机亲往前线视察，他不得不承认在“云山附近的南韩军情况困难”（泛亚社讯）。
    路透社报道英澳联军在嘉山地区（博川以西）的困难情况称：“战斗在山地进行”。朝鲜人民军“在公路两边的高地有着很好的工事掩护，并有坦克和自动炮的支持。”该消息承认人民军“异常激烈的抵抗”，使英、澳军的“推进遭受阻止”。
    在东海岸地区，美联社二十九日电承认：朝鲜人民军正在该地进行“坚强抵抗与顽强的地方战斗”。合众社记者查普曼描述在该区作战的李承晚军的狼狈处境称：“京都师部队遇到在数小时内把山脊埋在二寸至十二寸雪中的大风雪。许多朝鲜士兵仍穿着夏衣和破网球鞋。军官们说：前进得很慢。”该记者悲观地说：“他们现在正在气温降低到零下三十度的国家内打着看来似乎是长期的战争。”
    【新华社三十一日讯】塔斯社讯：朝鲜民主主义人民共和国人民军总司令部三十日发表战报称：人民军部队在各战线继续与敌军进行激战。
    在咸兴以北，人民军部队继续进行顽强的防御战，阻挠敌军的进犯。
    十月二十七日，人民军空军在永柔和安州附近击毁美军长途汽车数辆。
    在战线的其他地区，激烈的防御战仍在继续进行中。
