Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, 24th: The Chinese delegation attending the Second World Peace Congress has issued the following statement:

　　The Second World Peace Congress has been held and has achieved a historically significant victory. The Congress fully demonstrated the determination of all good people to defend peace, as well as the unity and consolidation of the world peace camp. More than two thousand representatives freely and extensively exchanged opinions on defending world peace, and jointly formulated resolutions on stopping war and defending peace. This will further expand the world peace camp and powerfully guarantee that peace will defeat war.

　　The Chinese people resolutely support the declaration of the Second World Peace Congress and the appeal to the United Nations Organization, and resolutely support the Congress's proposals on banning atomic weapons, universal reduction of armaments, banning war propaganda, strengthening and promoting economic and cultural exchanges between countries, and clearly defining aggression. The Chinese people are willing to work under the leadership of the newly established World Peace Council, and are willing to unite more closely with the people of other countries to fight to stop war and defend peace.

　　We believe that the US government's war of aggression against Korea must be stopped immediately, the invading armies of the United States and its vassal states must be withdrawn from Korea immediately, and the Korean issue should be resolved peacefully according to the free will of the Korean people.

　　We believe that the condemnation of MacArthur by the majority of representatives attending the Peace Congress vividly demonstrates the common will of all peace-loving people in the world. The Congress's demand for the immediate withdrawal of the US invading forces from Taiwan is entirely in line with the wishes of the Chinese people and the people of the world.

　　Only with the participation of the representatives of the People's Republic of China, which has a population of 475 million, can this international organization fulfill its lofty mission of safeguarding world peace and security.

　　We believe that after this Congress, the world peace movement will enter a new stage. The people of all countries should learn the spirit of the Congress and unite like one to carry out a common struggle. Peace will surely defeat war.

    【新华社华沙二十四日电】出席第二届世界保卫和平大会的中国代表团顷发表声明如下：
    第二届世界保卫和平大会已经举行，并且获得了具有重大历史意义的胜利。大会充分表现了所有善良人民保卫和平的决心及世界和平阵营的团结与巩固。两千多位代表们自由而广泛地交换了关于保卫世界和平的意见，并且共同制订了关于阻止战争与保卫和平的决议，这将使世界和平阵营更加扩大，而且强有力地保证和平必将击败战争。
    中国人民坚决拥护第二届世界保卫和平大会的宣言及致联合国组织的呼吁书，并且坚决拥护大会关于禁止原子武器、普遍裁减各种军备、禁止战争宣传、加强与促进各国间经济与文化交流及明确规定侵略定义的各项建议。中国人民愿意在刚成立的世界保卫和平委员会的领导下进行工作，并愿与其他各国人民更密切地团结起来，为制止战争保卫和平而斗争。
    我们认为必须立即制止美国政府侵略朝鲜的战争，美国及其仆从国家的侵略军必须立即全部撤离朝鲜，朝鲜问题应根据朝鲜人民的自由意志用和平方法解决。
    我们认为：出席和平大会的大多数代表对于麦克阿瑟的谴责，生动地表明了全世界所有爱好和平的人民的共同意志。大会要求立即撤退台湾的美国侵略军，是完全符合中国人民和世界人民的愿望的。
    唯有拥有四亿七千五百万人口的中华人民共和国的代表参加联合国，这个国际组织才有可能执行其保卫世界和平与安全的崇高任务。
    我们相信，经过这次大会，世界和平运动将进入新的阶段。世界各国人民应当学习大会的精神，并且团结得像一个人一样进行共同的斗争。和平必能击败战争。
