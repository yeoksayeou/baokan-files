　　Rural Women's Hatred and Confidence
    -- A Record of the Xuchang Special District Women Representatives' Symposium on Resisting America and Aiding Korea

Women representatives from various counties in the Xuchang Special District, Henan Province, came to Xuchang to attend the Special District Women Representatives' Congress. The liberated sisters met and chatted, each more joyful than the last. Yang Yuzhi, the women's committee member of Longquansi Township, Baofeng, told the 47-year-old female township head of Lushan County: "The folks in our area are clamoring that there are three great joys this year: Chairman Mao sits in Beijing, the country is well managed, and the poor are allocated land, with a bumper harvest, that's one joy; bandits are wiped out, and the people are producing with peace of mind, that's the second joy; Chairman Mao cares about the hardships of the peasants, and the burden is reduced, that's the third joy." Fengying also said to Yuzhi: "I was a child bride at six or seven years old, grew up eating chaff and vegetables, and my husband died early, leaving me and my child. I originally had three acres of land, but I couldn't afford the conscription fee, so the head of the bao forced me to take it away, and life was even harder, I lived my life with sweat and tears. I hated the landlords and bao heads to death. As soon as our village was liberated, I joined the women's association. The village saw that my struggle was active, and elected me as the chairman of the peasant association, and then elected me as the township head. When the land reform came, our family of four was allocated six acres of land, seeing the land was more dear than relatives! Don't look at me being over forty years old, I'm busy with work until midnight, and I pick up a hoe and go to the fields at dawn. My child is somewhat disabled and useless, and my daughter-in-law and I, we put more manure and hoe diligently. One acre of land gets up to three cartloads of manure. This autumn, five acres of corn yielded 1,700 jin. I never dreamed that I could have today: There is enough food to eat and more to spare. As for vegetables, we grow radishes ourselves. As for salt, we exchange eggs for it. We don't have to worry about the New Year. We raise pigs. These are all good years under the leadership of Chairman Mao!" Liu Fengying was even more happy that she could become a representative. She said, "In the past, if a woman went to the river to wash clothes, some people would say she was crazy. Now I have come to Xuchang, two hundred miles from home, to attend a meeting!" Yuzhi added: "Our women have really turned over! The whole family is happy for me to be a representative. The mud on the village head is half a foot deep, and my mother-in-law stepped on the mud and sent me half a mile. My father-in-law was afraid that I would be short of money, so he specially gave me 20,000 yuan for expenses. The old man is so worried, the hospitality at the meeting is so good, what money do we need to spend?"

These are some representatives of the thousands of rural liberated women after the land reform. They love the new country and the new life so much. When they heard that the American bandits were妄想to fight to the Yalu River, plotting to invade the motherland and destroy their peaceful life, it aroused their strong hatred.

On November 10th, at a small symposium on resisting America and aiding Korea, young female township head Yang Xiusheng said: "I see through America, it sees that the Chinese people are powerful, and dare not immediately attack mainland China, but take a detour to invade Korea first, and set fire in our neighbor's house first; only separated by a threshold, setting fire to the neighbor's house is also setting fire to our house, we can't ignore it!" Liu Fengying said: "North Korea is led by the Communist Party, just like our China, it is the world of the common people; South Korea's Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek are of the same ilk, the American bandits hate that our common people have turned over, and want to invade our Chinese and Korean people; let the American devils try, I am forty-seven years old, not too old, I can run sixty or seventy miles leading the militia to catch bullies, and I can also lead the militia to fight the American devils!"

Fan Quanlan, a women's committee member of Dawangzhuang Township, Linru County, has a blood feud with the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. Her husband was drafted into the Chiang bandit army four times. Once it was the twenty-something of the twelfth lunar month. Wearing a single layer of clothing, he sneaked home from the ranks. Fearing that the puppet bao head would know, he dared not knock on the door and froze at the door all night. Fan Quanlan opened the door early in the morning and saw her husband about to freeze. The couple cried in each other's arms. Her husband dared not show his face during the day and hid in an inaccessible cellar all day. Three months later, he sneaked seventy miles away to sell batter to make a living. Not many days later, he was captured by another part of the Chiang army. Fan Quanlan's mother's family ground military flour for the Chiang army. Urged urgently, they forced her father to death. They couldn't find a place to bury him for seventeen days, so they had to park the coffin on the hillside until after liberation, when they were allocated a few acres of land to settle down. She said excitedly: "Mentioning America helping the Chiang bandits, I think of the suffering I suffered in the past, I can't wait to grab Chiang Kai-shek and Truman and bite them a few times. If anyone wants to bully us again, our whole family will fight them to the death."

"The American soldiers are stupid big guys who are like wooden knives (watch but don't work), they can't compare to the People's Liberation Army. The Japanese devils were afraid of the "Eighth Route Army" (predecessor of the People's Liberation Army), they would first ask if there was an "Eighth Route" before daring to stay in a village; the American soldiers, as soon as they heard that the Japanese were coming, would run away from a distance!" Fan Quanlan's statement is based on fact. She introduced to everyone a farce of the American soldiers that she witnessed: it was the year before Japan surrendered, dozens of American soldiers were stationed at Fengxue Temple on Baishu Mountain, eighteen miles northeast of Linru County (running a "Sino-American training class", training special agents for the Kuomintang reactionaries who were dedicated to destroying the anti-Japanese democratic regime behind enemy lines and opposing communism), they ran away when they heard the news that the Japanese were about to attack. When they left, they grabbed the common people to lead the way. Walking on the mountain road, the American soldiers were so clumsy that they dared not descend the cliff. Squatting on their buttocks, they slid straight down with their legs straight. The carter cracked a "loud whip", and the American soldiers panicked and shot into the sky with a squint. Han Yulan, a representative from the first district of Xuchang, also had a common view: "Yes! I think the American soldiers are not enough for us to fight; comparing the big with the small: there are a few landlords in the village, how many of our peasants are there; there are a few American bad guys, how many people are there in the Soviet Union, China and the whole world! In the past, landlords bullied the peasants with bluster, but the peasants, united as one, organized and overthrew him!" Yang Xiusheng chimed in to add: "Take me for example, in the past, I didn't dare to speak loudly in the village, I didn't know anything before or after the stove, the Communist Party trained us to be township heads, and we led the masses to fight the landlords and engage in production, and learned a lot of skills, how much progress our women have made!"

Yang Yuzhi, who had been pondering for a long time, finally spoke: "Thinking about it, America and Chiang Kai-shek are like a group of rabbits. If the rabbits are not killed, they always want to bite the sweet potatoes (one of the important local food crops). Men, women, old and young, all work together to kill the rabbits, and we will eliminate the harm and be at ease. While the soldiers are fighting on the front lines, we are stepping up production in the rear and taking good care of the military families. We are representatives, and we have to take the lead and set an example first. I plan to spin flowers at home when it snows and rains, and step up the collection of manure when it is sunny. I can collect thirty big carts in one winter. Adding topdressing to the wheat fields next spring will increase the yield by two or three shi of grain and increase the strength of resisting America and aiding Korea to defend our country."

Yang Yuzhi also reminded everyone: "Sun Jinglin, the big landlord in our village, hid his gun on the roof. On a continuous cloudy day, a rafter broke, and the gun fell, but there was no "bolt". I led the militia to question him. He dodged and refused to say. I said, if you don't tell me, I'll send you to the People's Court. Only then did he tell the truth: "The bolt is under the eaves. It's not that I don't want to say it, I get annoyed when I see the poor people being allocated this house and that piece of land." Now, the situation is a bit tense, we must lead the militia well and prevent the landlords from spreading rumors and the sabotage of bandits and special agents."

　　农村妇女的憎恨和自信
    ——记许昌专区妇女代表座谈抗美援朝
    河南省许昌专区各县的妇女代表，来许昌出席专区妇女代表大会。翻身姊妹们见面，拉起家常来，一个比一个高兴。宝丰龙泉寺乡妇女委员杨玉芝告诉鲁山县四十七岁的女乡长：“俺那里老百姓嚷嚷着今年有三大喜：毛主席坐北京，国家管得好，穷人分到地，庄稼丰收，是一喜；剿灭土匪，百姓安心生产，是二喜；毛主席关心农民困苦，负担减轻是三喜。”凤英也向玉芝说：“俺六、七岁当童养媳妇，吃糠菜长大，丈夫死得早，撇下娘儿俩，俺原先有三亩地，拿不起壮丁费，硬被保长占去，生活更苦了，一把汗一把泪过日子，我恨死地主保长，俺村一解放，我就参加了妇女会，村上看我斗争积极，选我当农会主席，又选我当了乡长，土地改革啦，俺一家四口，分到六亩地，见到地比亲人还亲！别看我四十多岁了，晚上办工作忙半夜，天一明就扛起锄头下地啦。孩子有些残疾不中用，我和媳妇两个人，多上粪，锄的勤，一亩地上到三车粪，今年秋里，五亩玉米便打到一千七百斤。做梦没想到能有今天：粮食有吃的有余的，吃菜吧，自己种着萝卜，吃盐吧，用鸡蛋换，过年过节不用发愁啦，咱喂着猪，这都是毛主席领导的好年月啊！”刘凤英更高兴自己能当上代表，她说：“过去妇女到河上洗一次衣服，还有人说发疯哩，这会离家二百里到许昌来开会了！”玉芝又补充说：“咱妇女也实翻身啦，全家人都为我当代表高兴，村头上半尺深的泥，婆婆踩着泥送我半里地，公爹怕我短钱花，特意给我两万元盘缠，老人家多操心，会上招待这样好，咱花啥钱呢？”
    这是土地改革后，千万个农村翻身妇女中的一部分代表，她们是这样热爱着新的国家新的生活。当她们听到美国强盗妄想打到鸭绿江边，阴谋侵略祖国，破坏她们的和平生活的时候，激起了她们的强烈憎恨。
    十一月十日，在一个小型的抗美援朝座谈会上，青年女乡长杨秀生说：“我看透美国啦，它看到中国人民力量大，不敢马上进攻中国大陆，拐个弯先侵略朝鲜，先在咱邻家点火；只隔着一道门坎，点邻家的火，也就是点咱的火，咱可不能不管！”刘凤英说：“北朝鲜是共产党领导的，和咱中国一样，是老百姓的天下；南朝鲜李承晚和蒋介石是一派，美国强盗恨咱老百姓翻了身，就想侵略咱中朝人民；美国鬼子试试看吧，我四十七岁不算大，能跑六、七十里领着民兵抓恶霸，也就能领着民兵打美国鬼子！”
    临汝县大王庄乡妇女委员范全兰，她与蒋家匪帮有着血海深仇。她丈夫被蒋匪军抓了四次壮丁，有一次是腊月二十几，穿着一身单衣，从队伍上偷跑回家了，怕伪保长知道，不敢叫门，在门口冻了一整夜，范全兰清早开门，看见快要冻僵的丈夫，夫妻俩抱头哭泣，丈夫白天不敢露面，整天躲在不见天日的地洞里，三个月后偷跑到七十里外去卖面糊口，不几天，又被另一部分蒋军抓走了。范全兰娘家爹给蒋军磨军面，催的急，把爹逼死了，十七天没找到安葬的地方，只好把棺材停放在半山坎里，直到解放后，才分到几亩安身地。她激动地说：“提起美国帮助蒋贼，我就想起过去受到的苦难，恨不得抓住蒋介石、杜鲁门咬他两口，谁再想欺侮咱，咱全家都给它拚上。”
    “美国兵傻大个子给木刀样（管看不管用）不能给解放军比，日本鬼怕“八路军”（解放军前身），进村先问有没有“八路”，才敢住下；美国兵，一听说日本要来，老远就吓跑啦！”范全兰这种说法是有根据的。她向大家介绍了一段亲眼见到的美国兵的丑剧：是日本投降的前一年，有几十个美国兵，驻在临汝县东北十八里柏树山风穴寺（在办“中美训练班”，替国民党反动派训练专事破坏敌后抗日民主政权和反共的特工人员），听说日本要进攻的风声便跑了，临走时抓老百姓带路，走到山道上，美国兵笨得不敢下山崖，屁股一蹲，两腿一挺往下直滑。赶车的打了个“响鞭”，美国兵慌慌张张，眼睛一挤就朝天放枪。许昌一区代表韩玉兰也有共同的看法：“对啊！我看美国兵，不够咱打的；大处比小处：村上地主有几个，咱农民有多少；美国坏蛋头子有几个，苏联、中国全世界老百姓有多少！过去地主们吹胡瞪眼欺压农民，农民齐心，组织起来便斗垮他啦！”杨秀生插上去补充：“就拿我来说吧，过去在村上说话不敢用大声，灶前灶后，啥事不懂，共产党培养咱当了乡长，咱领着群众斗地主，搞生产，学会不少本事，光咱妇女进步多少啊！”
    沉思好久的杨玉芝，最后发言了：“想来想去，美国、蒋介石像一群兔子，兔子打不死，总想咬坏红薯（当地重要食粮之一），咱男女老少齐动手，打死兔子，就除害安心了。战士们前方打仗，咱在后方加紧生产，好好照顾军属。咱是代表，自己得带头先干出个样。我计划着下雪下雨在家纺花，晴天加紧拾粪，一冬能拾到三十大车，来春麦地加上追肥，就多打个两三石粮食，增加抗美援朝保家卫国的力量。”
    杨玉芝还提醒大家说：“俺村大地主孙景林，把枪藏在屋顶上，连阴天，椽坏了一根，枪掉下来，却没有“枪栓”了，我带领民兵去查问他，他躲躲闪闪不肯说，我说，再不说就送人民法庭，他才说了老实话：“枪栓在屋檐底下放着。不是不愿说，我看到穷人分去的这片房子、那片地就恼心。”现下，时局有些紧张，咱们要好好领导民兵，防止地主造谣和匪特的捣乱。”
