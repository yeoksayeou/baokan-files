　　Truman-MacArthur Talks Formulating Aggression Plan

　　Attempting to Use the United Nations to Make Taiwan a Permanent US Military Base

　　Indefinitely Occupying Japan and Intensifying Aggression in Southeast Asia

　　[Xinhua News Agency, 8th] Electric Communication Society, Washington, 7th: Electric Communication Society has recently learned from senior military authorities connected with former US Secretary of Defense James Forrestal that military and diplomatic figures in Washington are discussing some interesting, hitherto unpublished details regarding the October 15th meeting between President Truman and General MacArthur on Wake Island in the Pacific. The discussion is mainly focused on the Taiwan issue.

　　Electric Communication Society has learned that, regarding the Taiwan issue, Truman agreed with MacArthur that Taiwan should be made a strong US military base and US troops should be sent to Taiwan. Even before doing so, Chiang Kai-shek should be given financial aid as well as weapons and ammunition. The source who told Electric Communication Society the news said that Truman believes that the discussion on the Formosa (note: the US term for Taiwan) issue scheduled to be held at the United Nations on November 12th can achieve this goal.

　　Regarding the Japan issue, Truman and MacArthur unanimously agreed that, regardless of whether there will be a separate peace treaty with Japan in the future, indefinite US military occupation of Japan is necessary, because Truman believes that Japan must continue to be the main US military base in the Far East.

　　The main methods to achieve this goal are as follows: First, establish a naval and air force base system in Japan. This is already being done. A huge network of naval bases and military airfields is being established on the west coast of Japan and elsewhere in Japan. The cost of this base system will be paid from the taxes collected by the Yoshida government, amounting to 25 billion yen. Second, establish a Japanese army commanded by the United States and equip and train it according to American standards. Electric Communication Society has previously reported that the United States intends to establish a Japanese army of 700,000 men. Third, restore Japanese war industry. Fourth, suppress the communist movement and anti-American sentiment of the Japanese people. This is the most intense movement carried out by MacArthur, which has been underway since the spring of this year with the help of the ruling party in Japan and traitors of the Japanese progressive movement. In fact, the last point is a condition for all other measures.

　　Electric Communication Society has learned that Truman and MacArthur also paid special attention to Southeast Asia. The President and MacArthur both agreed that the national liberation movement in this part of the world is a serious obstacle to the US plan. They therefore decided to agree to the plan jointly proposed by MacArthur and Bradley, which stipulates that the United States directly leads the war against Vietnam and the entire Indochina militarily and politically. They unanimously agreed that the first step would be to send US troops to assist the Bao Dai puppet regime. The Wake Island meeting also agreed to increase aid to the armies of Burma, Thailand, Malaya, and Indonesia, and to universally strengthen the plans of these government armies.

　　Regarding Korea, Truman and MacArthur unanimously believed that the "resolutions" of the "United Nations" on the Korean issue made it possible for the United States to achieve its goals in this part of Asia.

　　电通社揭露
    杜麦会谈制定侵略计划
    企图利用联大使台湾永作美军基地
    无限期占领日本并加强侵略东南亚
    【新华社八日讯】电通社华盛顿七日讯：电通社顷自与前美国国防部长詹逊有关的高级军事权威人士方面获悉，华盛顿的军事及外交界人士正在讨论若干饶有兴趣的，迄今尚未发表过的关于十月十五日杜鲁门总统与麦克阿瑟将军在太平洋上威克岛会议的详情，讨论主要集中于台湾问题。
    电通社获悉，关于台湾问题，杜鲁门同意麦克阿瑟的意见，即应使台湾成为美国的强大军事基地并派遣美军至台湾。甚至在这样做前，就给蒋介石以财政援助以及武器与弹药。据告诉电通社消息的人士说，杜鲁门相信，可以使定于十一月十二日在联合国举行的福摩萨（按系美国对台湾的称呼）问题的讨论，达到这一方面的目的。
    关于日本问题，杜鲁门和麦克阿瑟一致同意，不论将来是否有一个单独对日和约，美军无限期占领日本是必要的，因为杜鲁门认为日本必须继续是美国在远东的主要军事基地。
    达到这一目的的主要方法有下列几点：第一，在日本建立海军及空军基地体系。这事已经在做，巨大的海军基地及军用机场网，正在日本西海岸及日本其他地方建立中。这个基地体系的费用将由吉田政府所征收的赋税中支付，为数达二百五十亿日元。第二，建立由美国指挥的日本陆军，并按照美国标准加以装备及训练。电通社前已报道过了，美国打算建立七十万人的日本陆军。第三，恢复日本战争工业。第四，镇压共产主义运动及日本人民的反美情绪。这是麦克阿瑟进行得最厉害的运动，这个运动自本年春季以来就一直在日本执政党及日本进步运动的叛徒的援助下进行着。事实上，最后的一点是一切其他各项措施的条件。
    电通社获悉，杜鲁门和麦克阿瑟也特别注意东南亚。总统和麦克阿瑟都一致认为，世界这一部分中的民族解放运动，乃是美国计划的一个严重障碍。他们因此决定同意麦克阿瑟和布莱德雷共同提出的计划，该计划规定美国在军事及政治上直接领导反对越南及整个印度支那的战争。他们一致同意，第一个步骤将是派遣美军援助保大傀儡政权。威克岛会议又同意增加对缅甸、泰国、马来亚及印尼政府军队的援助和普遍加强这些政府军队的计划。
    关于朝鲜，杜鲁门和麦克阿瑟一致认为，“联合国”关于朝鲜问题的“决议”，使美国有可能在亚洲这一部分地区实现其目的。
