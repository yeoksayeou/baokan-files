　　What I Saw of the So-Called "American Freedom of Speech and Thought"
　　Returned Student from the U.S.　Shen Dazun
　　American imperialism everywhere touts itself as a "free country," saying that its people "have obtained the basic freedoms of thought and speech, and that this basic freedom is a fundamental factor in promoting American cultural development." What is concealed behind this hypocritical freedom? The following examples may help to illustrate.
　　Mr. Watt Wilcox, who teaches farm management at the University of Wisconsin, used to teach at Iowa State Agricultural College. Because he published an article comparing the nutritional and economic value of margarine and natural butter, he concluded that the nutritional value of margarine was no worse than that of natural butter, while the price was cheaper. In order to improve the nutrition of poor Americans, he suggested that it was necessary to manufacture and promote it on a large scale. This article conflicted with the interests of the landowners in Iowa, which is mainly engaged in dairy farming. Under their joint attack, he had to transfer to the University of Wisconsin to teach. At the end of last year, Mr. Wei was invited to give a speech on the development of agriculture in Wisconsin on a Wisconsin radio station. After the broadcast, his daughter said to him: "Dad, when you mentioned the butter issue, I was really afraid you would bring up the same arguments you used to make in Iowa." This illustrates how American capitalists and landlords control the thoughts and speech of the American people.
　　In American universities and colleges, progressive theories are not allowed to be taught or discussed. Mr. 波番勃兰恼, a professor of economic theory at the University of Wisconsin, suggested to the school in the summer of 1948 that a course in Marxist economics be offered. He repeatedly proposed this to the department head and other professors in the economics department, but his suggestion was never considered and ultimately came to nothing. This shows that American higher education always revolves within the dark and gloomy scope of capitalist doctrines, and does not allow its professors and students to understand progressive thought and culture.
　　American imperialism does not allow its university professors to have freedom of thought, and wants them all to be echoes of capitalism. After they launched the war of aggression against Korea, the California authorities required professors at state universities to sign an oath stating that they were not members of the Communist Party when accepting their appointment letters. Some professors refused to comply with this unreasonable requirement because they did not want their personalities to be insulted. As a result, they were dismissed by the school, and their personal spirit and economy suffered serious blows. It is said that California's move will be imitated by other states.
　　American imperialism does not allow its domestic working class to have freedom of speech. In a car factory in Michigan, two young workers, because they were dissatisfied with their government's launching of the war in Korea and expressed pessimism about the future of the war, confided their inner thoughts to other workers in the factory one day. The consequence was that they were surrounded and beaten by a group of special agent workers when they left work in the evening. These special agents also stated that they would eliminate workers with the same progressive ideas in the factory.
　　American imperialism not only suppresses the thoughts and speech of its own people, but also interferes with the thoughts of people of other countries living in the United States. A gentleman at Iowa State Agricultural College personally told me that after the outbreak of the Korean War, personnel from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (American intelligence agency) often investigated the thoughts and actions of Chinese students. I once ordered some progressive books from International Publishers, and when I received these books, I found that each package had been opened. The American branch of the Chinese Scientific Workers Association has branch organizations in various schools. Every time we held meetings to contact venues and print some mimeographed materials, we were always hindered by the school authorities. On the way back home this time, I heard that this organization has been declared illegal by American imperialism and forced to disband. In addition, they also strictly restrict the research scope of foreign students, and do not allow us to study certain subjects that they consider to be related to the military. And prevent foreigners with scientific achievements from returning to their motherland. Our outstanding scientific workers Professors Qian Xuesen and Zhao Zongyao and classmates such as Luo Shijun have recently been detained for returning to their country, for fear that they will contribute their research experience to the people of their motherland.
　　The above examples are all ironclad facts, fully answering the question that under the rule of American imperialism, people have no freedom of thought and speech. While American imperialism uses shameless means to suppress progressive ideas and persecute democrats, it also tries its best to use pornographic culture to anesthetize its people. The American culture that grows up under these bad means is a culture based on thighs, chewing gum, theft and robbery. The consequence is that American people have a crazy pursuit of sex and fascist aggression. I have lived in the United States for more than three years, and I deeply feel that the American people have no freedom of thought and speech. Their culture is only a tool used by a few capitalists, war mongers and politicians. It is a product of the decadent and degenerate capitalist system. (Reprinted from Nanjing Xinhua Daily)

### 我所看到的所谓“美国言论思想自由”

　　我所看到的所谓“美国言论思想自由”
    留美返国学生　沈达尊
    美国帝国主义处处标榜他们是一个“自由的国家”，说他们的人民“已经获得了思想言论的基本自由，而这一基本自由是促进美国文化发展的基本因素。”掩饰在这种虚伪的自由后面究竟是一种什么情况呢？下面几个实例，可以帮助说明。
    在威斯康辛大学教农场管理的瓦特·威尔考克斯先生，以前本在爱渥华州立农工学院任教，因为发表了一篇比较人造牛油和天然牛油的营养和经济价值的文章，他归结到人造牛油的营养价值不比天然牛油为劣，同时价钱反便宜；为了增进美国穷苦人民的营养，他建议有大量制造和推广食用的必要。这篇文章和爱渥华州以经营乳牛业为主的地主的利益相冲突，在他们的联合攻击下，他不得不转往威斯康辛大学去任教。去年年底，威先生被请到威州广播电台做一次关于威州农业的发展的演讲，播讲完毕回家后，他的女儿和他说：“爸爸，当你提到牛油问题时，我真怕你又把过去在爱州时的论调拿出来。”这说明了美国的资本家，大地主怎样控制着美国人民的思想言论。
    在美国的大学院校里，进步的理论是不准讲授讨论的。在威州大学教授经济理论的波番勃兰恼先生，在一九四八年的夏天曾建议校方开一门马克思经济学的课程，几度在经济系向系主任和其他的教授提出，他这一建议始终未被考虑，结果成为泡影。这说明了美国的高等教育，总是在暗无天日的资本主义学说的范畴中转圈子，不让他们的教授和学生了解进步的思想和文化。
    美帝不让他们的大学教授有思想的自由，要他们都做资本主义的应声虫，当他们发动侵略朝鲜战争以后，加尼福尼亚州当局要州立大学的教授在接受聘书时，附签一张本人非共产党党员的誓书，一部分教授因为不愿自己的人格受侮辱，拒绝遵从这种无理的规定，结果是被校方解聘，个人的精神和经济都受到了严重的打击，听说加州这一举动，其他各州亦将仿效实行。
    美帝不让国内劳苦的工人有言论的自由。在密西根州一个汽车工厂中，有两个年青工人因为不满他们政府在朝鲜发动战争，并对战局前途表示悲观，有一天在厂中将他俩内心的话和其他一些工人倾谈，其后果是在傍晚散工时为一群特务工人包围痛打，这些特务并声言要清除厂内有同样进步思想的工人。
    美帝不仅是对他们本国人民的思想言论加以压抑，即对旅居美国的其他国家内的人民的思想也横加干涉。爱渥华州立农工学院中的一位先生亲自告诉我在朝鲜战事发生后，联邦调查统计局（美国特务机关）的人员不时向他调查中国同学的思想行动。我曾向国际出版社定购一些进步书籍，这些书籍当我收到时发现一包包都被拆开了。中国科学工作者协会美国分会在各校中都有支会组织，当我们每次开会接洽会场和印行一些油印品时，总是受到学校当局阻碍。此次在归航途中，听说这一组织已被美帝宣布为非法而被迫解散。此外，他们对于外国学生的研究范围也严加限制，某些他们认为与军事有关的学科不让我们学习。并阻止在科学上有成就的外国人回归他们的祖国。我国卓越的科学工作者钱学森、赵宗尧两教授和罗时钧等同学最近均因回国而被扣留，为的是怕他们将研究心得，贡献给祖国的人民。
    以上这些实例都是铁的事实，充分的回答了在美帝统治下的人民，自无思想和言论的自由这一问题。美帝一面用无耻的手段压抑进步思想，迫害民主人士，同时尽量的利用色情文化来麻醉他们的人民，在这些恶劣的手段下所成长的美国文化是以大腿、口香糖和盗窃抢劫为主体的文化，其后果是造成美国人民对性的疯狂的追求和法西斯的侵略思想。我在美国生活了三年多，深深的感到美国人民没有思想和言论的自由，他们的文化只是为少数资本家、战争贩子和政客们所利用的工具，是腐朽与堕落的资本主义制度下的产物。（转载南京新华日报）
