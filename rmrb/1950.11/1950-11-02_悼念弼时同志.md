　　In Memory of Comrade Bi Shi

　　For the cause of the whole Party, for the cause of the people, with selfless spirit, he was always responsible, dedicated himself to the task, and died only after his work was done;

　　Mastering Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, he resolutely fought against internal and external enemies, overcame everything, and was a perfect person.

    为全党的事业，人民的事业，以忘我精神始终负责，鞠躬尽瘁，死而后已；
    掌握马列主义、毛泽东思想，向内外敌人坚决斗争，战胜一切，是为完人。
