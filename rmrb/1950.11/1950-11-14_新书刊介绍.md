New Book and Periodical Introductions
            World Knowledge, Volume 22, Issue 19
    The international affairs weekly "World Knowledge," Volume 22, Issue 19, was published on November 11th. This issue features an editorial titled "Marching to Liberate Tibet, Consolidating National Defense, and Eliminating Imperialist Forces!" It points out that the Chinese People's Liberation Army's march to liberate Tibet is entirely an internal affair of China and is in line with the demands of the people of the whole country, and no other country has any reason to interfere. The editorial emphasizes that we must liberate Tibet and Taiwan. China's territory must be completely liberated, and imperialist conspiracies of aggression must never be allowed. This issue includes He Sheng's special article "Resisting America Requires Aiding Korea!" which points out that China and Korea have a "lips and teeth" relationship geographically and strategically. To resist our mortal enemy, American imperialism, we must aid Korea, and saving our neighbor is saving ourselves. Our aid to the Korean people in resisting aggression is to protect the security of our motherland and to safeguard world peace. There are also Hu Zhongchi's "Welcoming the Second World Peace Congress" and Bin Fu's "Wall Street's Attack on the American People," as well as Li Ya's "The Road to Soviet Scientific Achievements," and other articles. Starting with this issue, the journal opens a column called "A Corner of the World," reporting and introducing news and information from around the world, with short, concise, lively text that can help readers understand the situation in various parts of the world. In response to readers' requests, this issue has many more illustrations and cartoons, all drawn by famous cartoonists and reprinted from newspapers and periodicals from various countries.
            "Mechanical Worker" Second Issue Published; Solicitation of Commemorative Subscribers Deadline Approaching
    The monthly magazine "Mechanical Worker," published by the Science and Technology Publishing House, has been warmly welcomed by mechanical workers in factories and mines across the country since its inaugural issue on October 1st, due to its content being technical knowledge articles that mechanical workers need most.

Among them, "Methods of Turning Taper Pins" and "Material Cutting Methods" are two articles written by workers themselves based on their experience and the theories they have learned, and they are also two problems that mechanical workers encounter most often, and are worth referring to by workers across the country. The "Technical Textbook" column in this issue continues to serialize "Basic Knowledge of Basic Machine Parts," "Metalworking Lectures," "Lathe Operation Methods," and "Foundry Knowledge." The "Practical Factory Data" column contains four articles: "Steel Wire Measurement of Thread Value Table," "Drill Diameter Table for Drilling Screw Holes," "Exchange Gear Table for Lathe Universal Milling Machine and Gear Machine," and "Thread Lead Angle Table," all of which are the most needed reference materials for mechanical workers in practical work.
