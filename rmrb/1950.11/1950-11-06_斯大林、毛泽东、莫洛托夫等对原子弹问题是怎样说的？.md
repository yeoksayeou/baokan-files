Stalin, in response to a question about the atomic bomb posed by Mr. Werth, the Moscow correspondent of the British Sunday Times, on September 17, 1946, said: "I do not regard the atomic bomb as a serious force, as some politicians tend to do. The atomic bomb is intended to intimidate the nervous, but it cannot decide the fate of a war, because the atomic bomb is completely insufficient to decide the fate of a war. Indeed, a monopoly on the secret of the atomic bomb can create a threat, but there are at least two remedies for this:
	(1) The monopoly on the atomic bomb cannot last long;
	(2) The use of the atomic bomb will be banned."

	Chairman Mao said in an interview with foreign journalists in September 1946: "The atomic bomb is a paper tiger used by the U.S. reactionaries to scare people. It looks terrible, but in fact it isn't. Of course the atom bomb is a weapon of mass slaughter, but the outcome of a war is decided by the people, not by one or two new types of weapon." "The creation of the atomic bomb marks the beginning of the demise of U.S. imperialism, because what they rely on is only bombs, and the ending will not be the bombs eliminating the people, but the people eliminating the bombs."

	Molotov said at the grand meeting in Moscow celebrating the 30th anniversary of the October Revolution on November 6, 1947: "Everyone knows that among those in the United States who advocate foreign expansion, there is a strange and peculiar religion: because they do not believe in their internal strength, they become superstitious about the secret of the atomic bomb, although this secret has long ceased to exist. Apparently, the imperialists need this kind of superstition about the atomic bomb, and everyone knows that the atomic bomb is not a defensive tool, but a weapon of aggression. The fact that the United States and Britain are preventing the United Nations from finally deciding to ban atomic weapons has angered many people."

	Molotov said at the grand meeting in Moscow celebrating the 31st anniversary of the October Revolution on November 6, 1948: "The more stubbornly the aggressors resist the prohibition of atomic weapons, the deeper the division will be between the forces of aggression and imperialism and the forces that support and promote universal peace and democracy. From this, it can be seen that the thugs of atomic weapons will inevitably become more and more isolated in world opinion day by day. From this, it can also be seen that the Soviet Union, in leading the struggle to ban the heinous atomic weapons, stands at the forefront of all peace-loving countries and all progressive men and women in the world."

	Malenkov (one of the heads of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union) said at the grand meeting in Moscow celebrating the 32nd anniversary of the October Revolution on November 6, 1949: "One of the most important components of the war-mongers' aggressive front is the so-called atomic diplomacy. The adventurous nature of this atomic diplomacy has now been completely exposed. Because, truly, this diplomacy is built on the absolutely false assumption that the United States has a monopoly on atomic weapons. In fact, we all know that the Soviet government has never concealed the fact that it has atomic weapons. The Soviet government made the world aware in 1947 that the secret of the atomic bomb no longer exists. However, the arrogant war-mongers, who know nothing about reality, are still obsessed with their bombastic atomic diplomacy."

	Molotov said at the voters' meeting in the Molotov electoral district in Moscow on March 10 this year: "All kinds of blackmailers in this camp threatened us with atomic bombs yesterday. Today, they are threatening us with 'hydrogen bombs' that do not yet exist. They should not boast so much, they should always remember this: when they intimidated people by saying that they exclusively possessed atomic bombs, everyone knew that the Soviet people were not idle, they probed the secrets of producing atomic energy and atomic weapons. Only fools like a certain mad minister (referring to former US Secretary of Defense Forrestal, who died of madness) would indulge in such a crazy plan, namely: to intimidate the Soviet Union and promote various aggressive plans to deceive their people. They do not understand that, in the current situation, if the imperialists refuse peaceful competition and launch a new war, they will inevitably arouse the just and resolute anger of the people of all countries, and this anger will forever eliminate imperialism and aggressors from the world."

　　斯大林、毛泽东、莫洛托夫等对原子弹问题是怎样说的？
    斯大林在一九四六年九月十七日，答复英国星期泰晤士报驻莫斯科记者约尔特所提出的关于原子弹的问题时说：“我不认为原子弹像某些政治家所看成的是一种严重的力量。原子弹是企图威吓神经脆弱的人，可是它不能解决战争的命运。因为要解决战争命运，原子弹是完全不够的。的确，垄断原子弹的秘密，会造成威胁，可是对付这点至少有两种补救办法：
    （一）对于原子弹的垄断不能继续很久；
    （二）采用原子弹将被禁止。”

    毛主席在一九四六年九月与外国记者谈话时说：“原子弹是一只纸老虎，看样子可怕，实在并不可怕。真正的力量不在于反动派，而在于人民。”“原子弹的产生，就是美帝国主义灭亡的开始，因为它们依靠的只是炸弹，而结局将不是炸弹消灭人民，而是人民消灭炸弹。”
    ×    ×      ×
    莫洛托夫一九四七年十一月六日在莫斯科庆祝十月革命节三十周年纪念大会上说：“大家知道，在美国主张向外扩张的人物中间，流行着一种新奇的特殊的宗教：因为不相信自己的内部力量，于是就来迷信原子弹的秘密，虽然这一秘密早已就不存在了。大概，帝国主义者需要有对原子弹的这种迷信，而这原子弹，谁都知道不是什么防御工具，而是一种进攻的武器。美国和英国妨碍联合国最终决定禁止原子武器，这使许多人表示愤懑。”
    ×    ×      ×
    莫洛托夫一九四八年十一月六日在莫斯科庆祝十月革命节三十一周年大会上说：“侵略分子对禁止原子武器抵抗得越是顽固，侵略与帝国主义势力和支持促进普遍和平与民主的力量之间的分裂就会更深。由此可见，原子武器的棍徒们必定会一天一天的在世界舆论中变得更加孤立。由此也可以看到，苏联在领导争取禁止罪恶的原子武器的斗争中，是站在全世界一切爱好和平的国家和一切进步男女的前列。”

    马林柯夫（苏联共产党中央负责人之一）在一九四九年十一月六日莫斯科庆祝十月革命节三十二周年大会上说：“战争贩子的侵略战线的最重要的组成因素之一，就是所谓原子外交，这种原子外交的冒险性质，现今已被全部揭露无遗了。因为，诚然，这种外交是建立在绝对虚妄的假定之上的，自以为美国独占着原子武器，实际上，我们都知道，苏联政府毫不曾隐瞒它有原子武器这一事实。苏联政府曾在一九四七年使全世界知道，原子弹的秘密已不复存在了。然而，妄自尊大的战争贩子们，对于现实茫无所知，仍旧念念不忘于他们的大言不惭的原子外交。”
    ×    ×      ×
    莫洛托夫今年三月十日在莫斯科莫洛托夫选区的选民大会上说：“这个阵营中的各种各样的讹诈者们昨天用原子弹来威胁我们。今天，他们又用还没有存在的“氢弹”来威胁我们。他们不要吹得这样厉害，他们倒不如永远记住这一点：当他们吓诈人们说他们独家拥有原子弹时，大家知道，苏联人民并不是游手好闲的，他们试探了生产原子能和原子武器的秘密。只有像某一个发了疯的部长（按指因发疯致死的前美国国防部长福莱斯特尔）那样的蠢材，才会沉溺于这样疯狂的计划，即：恫吓苏联并宣传各种各样的侵略计划来迷惑他们的人民。他们不了解，在目前的情况下，帝国主义者们若拒绝和平竞赛并发动新战争，他们将不可免地激起各国人民的正当的和坚决的愤怒，这种愤怒将把帝国主义和侵略者从世界上永远消灭掉。”
