　　Responding to the World Federation of Trade Unions' Call to Support the Korean War of Liberation
　　Chinese Textile Workers Donate慰劳Goods
　　[Reported by this newspaper] In order to combat the American imperialist conspiracy of aggression and defend Asian and world peace, Chinese textile workers responded to the World Federation of Trade Unions' call of July 5th to support the Korean people. They enthusiastically implemented the resolution passed at the First National Congress of the Textile Workers' Union of China in July to support the Korean people's liberation struggle. Textile workers in various regions not only supported the Korean people with practical actions of active production, but also donated慰劳goods to慰劳the Korean People's Army. Many female workers sacrificed sleep time to embroider exquisite慰问bags in order to rush the production of慰劳goods. The慰问bags sent from Zhengzhou were embroidered with the words "Liberate Korea" and "Drive out the American Imperialists." Workers at Tianjin Zhongfang No. 2 Factory also sent their beloved毛巾被to the Korean People's Army. Female workers at Beiyang Yarn Factory rushed to sew shoelaces at night, saying, "Tie the shoes tight, chase fast!" Workers at Hengyuan Textile Factory took out all the prizes they had just received. Workers at Shijiazhuang Daxing Yarn Factory also sent needles and thread, saying, "The People's Army can sew and mend their clothes if they are torn." As of early November, the National Committee of the Textile Workers' Union had received from the Northeast, Lushun-Dalian, Tianjin, Qingdao, Jinan, Zhengzhou, Pingyuan, Shijiazhuang, Yuci, Changzhou, Wuxi, Southern Jiangsu, Guangzhou and other regions: nine thousand three hundred and seventy慰问bags, two thousand six hundred and fifty-nine慰问letters, three锦旗, as well as eight thousand five hundred and thirty-four daily necessities such as soap and towels, one thousand two hundred and two stationery items, and RMB 1,281,200 yuan. These慰劳goods express the Chinese textile workers' warm sympathy and lofty respect for the Korean people and People's Army who are fighting hard; and express that the Chinese textile workers will do everything possible to support the Korean people's liberation struggle towards victory!
　　Every慰问letter fully demonstrates the Chinese textile workers' love of peace, but in order to defend peace, they never have been and never will be afraid to resist wars of aggression, and even more cannot allow the American imperialists to肆行aggression against their neighbors and ignore it. He (she) writes in the慰问letter: "We are textile workers, we did not pick up guns and go to the battlefield, but we will use all our strength in production, use the action of increasing production to build our powerful national defense army, liberate our Taiwan, and support our Korean brothers who are being invaded by American imperialism with brotherly love." "The American imperialists' brutal massacre, unrestrained bombing, and their conspiracies and tricks have increased the difficulties of your liberation struggle, but we believe that the power of the people cannot be intimidated by cannons and machine guns."
　　[Another News] The National Committee of the Textile Workers' Union of China has transferred the慰劳goods sent by textile workers from various regions to the Korean Embassy on October 26, and Ambassador Li Zhouyuan personally accepted them. Ambassador Li expressed his deep gratitude on behalf of the Korean people and the Korean People's Army for the care of the Chinese textile workers, and expressed that the Korean people will surely overcome difficulties, defeat enemies at home and abroad, and achieve final victory. It is hoped that the people of China and North Korea will always unite and strive for peace and security in Asia! (Li Wen)

　　响应世界工联号召支援朝鲜解放战争
    中国纺织职工捐献慰劳物品
    【本报讯】为了打击美国帝国主义的侵略阴谋，保卫亚洲与世界和平，中国纺织职工响应了世界工联七月五日支援朝鲜人民的号召，热烈地执行了七月中国纺织工会第一届全国代表大会上通过的支援朝鲜人民解放斗争的决议，各地纺织职工不但以积极生产的实际行动支援朝鲜人民，并纷纷捐献慰劳物品慰问朝鲜人民军。很多女工为了赶制慰劳品，牺牲睡觉时间绣出精致的慰问袋。郑州送来的慰问袋上绣满了“解放朝鲜”、“赶走美帝”的字样。天津中纺二厂的工人把心爱的毛巾被也送给了朝鲜人民军。北洋纱厂的女工们晚上赶缝鞋带，她们说：“系紧了鞋，追的快！”恒源纺织厂的工人把刚发的全部奖品都拿出来了。石家庄大兴纱厂的工人还送了针和线，她们说：“人民军衣服破了可以缝缝连连。”截至十一月初，纺织工会全国委员会已收到的慰劳品有东北、旅大、天津、青岛、济南、郑州、平原、石家庄、榆次、常州、无锡、苏南、广州等地区所送慰问袋九．三七○个，慰问信二、六五九封，锦旗三个，另有肥皂、毛巾等日用品八、五三四件，文具用品一、二○二件以及人民币一、二八一、二○○元。这些慰劳品表示着中国纺织职工对正在艰苦奋战的朝鲜人民和人民军怀着热烈的同情与崇高的敬意；并表示中国纺织职工将竭尽一切可能支援朝鲜人民解放斗争走向胜利！
    每一封慰问信里都充分表现了中国纺织职工热爱和平，但为了保卫和平，从不也永不害怕反抗侵略战争，更不能听任美帝对自己的邻邦肆行侵略而置之不理。他（她）们在慰问信里写着：“我们是纺织工人，我们没有拿起枪杆到战场，可是我们要把全身的劲用在生产上，用增加生产的行动建立我们强大的国防军，解放我们的台湾，并以兄弟之爱支援我们受到美国帝国主义侵略的朝鲜兄弟。”“美帝的残暴屠杀、放肆滥炸和他们的阴谋诡计，给你们的解放斗争增加了困难，但是我们相信人民的力量不是大炮和机枪可以吓倒的。”
    【又讯】中国纺织工会全国委员会已于十月二十六日将各地纺织职工所送慰劳品转送朝鲜大使馆，由李周渊大使亲自接受。李大使代表朝鲜人民和朝鲜人民军向中国纺织职工的关怀，深致谢意，并表示朝鲜人民必能克服困难，战胜国内外敌人，取得最后胜利。希望中朝两国人民永远团结在一起为亚洲的和平与安全而奋斗！（李文）
