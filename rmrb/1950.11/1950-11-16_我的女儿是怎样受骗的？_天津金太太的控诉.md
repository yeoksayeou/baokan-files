Editor's Note: The following is a letter sent to the Tianjin Daily by someone signing as "Mrs. Jin." In this letter, she accuses the U.S. military of an act of robbery in Tianjin.

To the Editor:

Fifteen years ago, my husband died, leaving behind my daughter, Yingying, and me. We relied on a small amount of rent to survive.

Yingying was a bright student and did very well in her studies, especially in English. She often said, "America is the richest and most powerful country in the world. I want to learn English well so I can study in America someday!"

In the year of the "August 15th" victory, the U.S. military arrived in Tianjin. Soon after, American goods were shipped to Tianjin—cosmetics, watches, pens, all so beautiful that we were dazzled. Before long, relief supplies arrived batch after batch. I remember receiving a few pairs of suit pants. The material was really good, even though they were full of holes. But it made me exclaim in admiration, "America is so wealthy!" From then on, both Yingying and I admired America.

One day, Yingying brought home an American military officer, saying she met him at a school play held for Allied forces. His name was Jennesse, a major.

From then on, every Sunday, Major Jennesse would find Yingying to watch movies or dance. He also gave Yingying many gifts. Gradually, Yingying started coming home later at night. I was a little uneasy, but then I thought that America was a civilized country and its people must have good morals. I must be overthinking things.

One day, I went to the street to buy coarse flour. Passing by the entrance of a food store, I saw two American military officers with a Chinese girl, all drunk, stumbling out. As they passed me, I suddenly saw that the officer on the left was Major Jennesse! I was stunned. At that moment, I heard the store owner muttering and cursing, "Damn it! These drunks ate and drank without paying and even broke two pieces of glass!" Another person said, "That's nothing. Didn't Yutai Xiang have a bunch of things robbed by drunks last night?" I almost couldn't believe my ears or my eyes. My face burned like fire. I didn't buy the flour and went straight home. I kept thinking, "An American major eating for free? No! I have to tell Yingying to break off contact with the Americans immediately!"

But that very night, Yingying didn't come home. I called her school, but they said she wasn't there. I was like an ant on a hot stove, not sleeping a wink all night. The next morning, I went everywhere to look for her, asking about all the places Yingying might have gone, but she wasn't at any of them. I ran to the American military barracks to ask, but a guard at the gate pushed me out, saying there were no female students there. On the third day, Yingying still hadn't returned. I was very worried and went to the American barracks to find Major Jennesse directly. They ignored me, so I started crying and making a scene. Finally, an American officer came out and told a translator to say to me, "Is this old woman crazy? How could your daughter be here? And Major Jennesse isn't here. He went back to America at three o'clock today. Get out of here! Don't make trouble here. Quick! Get her out!" "What? Jennesse is gone? Did he take my daughter? Give me back my daughter! Give me back my daughter!" I screamed hoarsely, but the American officer just laughed and said something in gibberish.

I don't know how I got home. I lay in bed, crying and regretting. I was fooled! Where did my Yingying go? All day, I didn't eat or drink, I called out, waited, and searched. Finally, on the fifth day, I received a letter from Yingying. Trembling, I hurriedly opened it:

Dear Mother:

We were deceived. We treated such fierce and cruel American military officers as friends. We were blind. I don't have the face to go back and see you, Mother! Now I must say goodbye to you forever. Please don't be sad. Remember to avenge me!

The day before yesterday, Jennesse told me that they had received orders from their superiors to return to America, and he invited me to a dance party at his place that night.

That night, the dance went on until 2 a.m. I was anxious to go home, but the robber Jennesse tricked me, saying he would send me home after we had supper. Mother! That very night, I was raped by him. And the next day, he wouldn't let me out, locking me in the house. I tried everything to jump out the window, and I tried everything to commit suicide, but I didn't succeed. Mother! Because I didn't have the courage. I'm so young, only just eighteen years old. I still hoped to go back and see you. Who knew I would suffer such cruel abuse.

Last night, the robber Jennesse came in with three of his friends. They ate and drank heavily, got drunk, and they gang-raped me. Dear Mother! Because I struggled and screamed in anger, they stuffed my mouth with cloth and scratched my arms. Then, they viciously took my watch, diamond ring, and necklace from me, put me in a car, and halfway there, they pushed me out, saying, "Goodbye, Miss! We're getting on a ship to go back to America."

Dear Mother! Don't forget that they laid such a cruel hand on me. They are the most inhuman beasts! At the time, I wanted to take revenge, but we don't have the power, and there's nowhere to seek justice. I only blame myself for believing the Kuomintang's propaganda and mistaking robbers for friends. Mother, I have no face to go back and see you, and no face to go back and see my classmates. I'm sorry to you, sorry for your upbringing. I have decided to take this final path. Goodbye! Mother! I don't want you to see my dishonored body. I will drift away with the sea! May Mother live strongly and avenge your daughter!

Your daughter, Yingying (written as she dies)
April 16th

After reading this letter, I fainted countless times. I was like a madwoman. I wanted to sue him. I wanted revenge! But at that time, I didn't want the neighbors to know, feeling it was a shameful thing. I took the letter to the court and the American military headquarters many times. But they wouldn't investigate, saying I made it up. I endured this injustice for four years until after liberation, I realized that this was nothing to be ashamed of. I was wronged. I should speak it out. I want to accuse the American imperialists of harming my daughter. The American imperialists are my mortal enemies. I want revenge. We cannot allow them to invade China again. We must help Korea and drive the American bandits out of Asia!

Mrs. Jin

### 我的女儿是怎样受骗的？——天津金太太的控诉

　　我的女儿是怎样受骗的？
    ——天津金太太的控诉
    编者按：本文是一位署名“金太太”的寄给天津日报的信。在这封信里，控诉了美军在天津的一件强盗行为。
    编辑同志：
    十五年前我丈夫就死了。丢下我跟一个女儿英英，我们娘俩就靠着一点房租活着。
    英英上学还聪明，功课考的很好，尤其喜欢英文，她常说：“美国是世界上最富强的国家，我要把英文学好，将来到美国留学去！”
    “八一五”胜利那年，美军开到了天津。紧跟着美国货也运到了天津，什么化装品、手表、钢笔，都是那么漂亮，真使我们眼睛都花了。不久，救济物资也一批一批的运来了。记得我还领过几条西服裤子，料子可真好，就是破的地方太多了，但这已经使我禁不住的赞叹：“美国有多阔！”从那儿，我和英英都崇拜起美国来了。
    有一天，英英领来了一位美国军官，说是在学校演话剧招待盟军认识的，名字叫甄奈斯，是个少校。
    自此，每逢礼拜天，甄奈斯少校就找英英来，看电影或是跳舞，还送给英英许多礼物。渐渐英英晚上回来的比较晚，我心里可有点不安了，但又一想人家美国是个文明大国，人民的道德一定很好，自己也未免有些太过虑了。
    有一天，我到街上去买杂面，路过一个食品店的门口，看见有两个美国军官夹着一个中国女孩子喝得醉熏熏从里面出来，打我身边闪过，忽然我瞧见左边的那个军官就是甄奈斯少校！不由我就一楞，这时候，我就听见店里掌柜的正嘟噜着骂呢：“他妈的！这帮醉鬼，吃了喝了不给钱，还给砸碎了两块玻璃！”另一位说：“这还好呢，昨天晚上裕泰祥不是叫醉鬼抢走了好些东西？”嗯！我简直有点不相信自己的耳朵，也不相信自己的眼睛，脸上像火一样的烧起来。杂面也没买，就回家了。一路上想：“美国少校白吃东西？不！我得给英英说说，叫她赶快跟美国人断绝来往！”
    可是，就在这天晚上，英英没回来。我往她学校里打电话，学校里说没有。这时，我像灶上的蚂蚁一样，一夜也没合眼。第二天一早，就上各处去找，是英英可能去的地方都问过了，结果各处都没有。我又跑到美国兵营去问，叫门上一个站岗的硬推出来，说那里很本没有什么女学生。等第三天，英英还不见回来。这会儿，我可急了，又跑到美国兵营直接找甄奈斯少校。他们不理我，我就大哭大闹。结果，有一位美国军官出来，叫翻译对我说：“你这老太太是有神经病吗？嗯，我们这里怎么能有你的女儿？并且甄奈斯少校也不在这里啊，他今天三点已回美国去了。快滚开！别在这里捣乱。快！让她滚！”“什么？甄奈斯走了？是不是把我女儿带走了？你们还我的女儿！还我的女儿！”我嘶声叫着，可是那美军官却哈哈大笑起来，叽哩咕噜的不知说了些什么。
    我不知道我是怎样走回家来的，我躺在床上痛哭、悔恨，我上了当！我的英英那儿去了？整天我不吃不喝、呼叫、期待、寻找，终于在第五天接到了英英的一封信，我颤抖着急忙打开来看：亲爱的妈妈：
    我们受骗了，我们把这样凶恶残酷的美国军官当做了朋友，是我们瞎了眼睛。我没有脸再回去见您，妈妈！现在我要向您永别，请您不要难过，记住了，要为我报仇！
    在大前天，甄奈斯告诉我，他们接到上级命令，要他们几个人回美国去，他约我晚上到他那里开跳舞晚会。
    这天晚上，舞会直跳到夜里两点，我急着回去，可是甄奈斯强盗他骗我说吃完夜餐才送我走。妈妈！就在这天晚上我被他奸污了。并且到第二天，他还不让我出去，把我关在房子里。我想尽了方法想从窗口跳出去，也想尽了方法想着自杀，但都没成功。妈妈！因为我没有勇气，我的年岁这么小，才刚刚十八岁，我还希望回去见您，谁知我遭了这样残酷的蹂躏。
    昨天晚上，甄奈斯强盗跟他的三个朋友一齐进来，他们大吃大喝，喝醉了，他们轮奸了我。亲爱的妈妈！因为我忿怒的挣扎嘶喊，他们用布堵住了我的嘴，又抓破了我的手臂。然后，他们又凶狠的从我身上摘下手表、钻戒、项链，把我带上了汽车，走在半路，他们把我推下来，还说：“小姐！再见！我们上轮船回美国了。”
    亲爱的妈妈！不要忘记，他们在我身上下了这样的毒手，他们是最没人性的野兽！当时，我本想要报仇，可是我们没有力量，又没有说理的地方。我只怪自己听信了国民党的宣传，错认了强盗做朋友。妈妈我再没脸回去见您，也没脸回去见我的同学们。我对不起您，对不起您的抚养，我已决定走这最后的一条路，再见吧！妈妈！我不愿您看见我受辱的身体，我要随着海水漂去！愿妈妈坚强的活下去，给女儿报仇！
    您的女儿英英绝笔
    四月十六日
    我看完了这封信，不知昏过去多少次，我像疯了似的，我要去告他，我要报仇！可是那时我又不愿叫邻居们知道，觉得这是一件丢人的事。我曾经拿着信三番五次地找到法院，找到美军司令部。但他们不给我调查，说是我捏造的。我忍冤忍了这四年，直到解放后，我才觉悟到这不是什么丢人的事，我受了冤，我应该把它说出来，我要控诉美帝残害了我的女儿。美帝是我的死敌，我要报仇。我们不能应许他再一次侵入我们中国，我们一定要帮助朝鲜，把美国强盗赶出亚洲去！
    金太太
