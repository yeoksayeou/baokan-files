Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, November 24th: Farmers in the Changbai Mountain area, who have suffered frequent bombing and strafing by American aircraft, are burning with the flames of angry revenge. From November 1st to 14th, American aircraft intruded into the airspace over the three counties of Ji'an, Linjiang, and Changbai along the north bank of the Yalu River in the Changbai Mountain area as many as 52 times, including eight bombings and strafing runs. The people of the Changbai Mountain area have all these blood debts etched in their hearts.

In Huangbaidian District, Ji'an County, after farmers raised funds to bury Yu Xiuting, a farmer from Huapidianzi Village who died in the disaster, thousands of people have packed their bags and are about to join the Chinese People's Volunteers to Resist America and Aid Korea, Protect Our Homes and Defend the Country, or take on military transportation work. In order to increase the economic strength of our national defense, farmers throughout the district have paid off 45,900 catties of public grain in ten days.

Wang Xiantang, a farmer from Erdaogou Village, Weishahe District, Linjiang County, who was injured by American aircraft, is about to recover from his injuries after the people of the entire district raised more than 5 million yuan to treat him. He said that after being discharged from the hospital, he would go to Korea to seek revenge on the American devils. His father, Wang Zuosheng, is also preparing boats to serve the volunteer army. The people of Linjiang County have put forward the slogan "Avenge Wang Xiantang." Young people have joined the militia organization and are guarding the forefront of our national defense day and night, armed with weapons. In addition, hundreds of stretchers have been prepared to support the Korean people's war of resistance against America.

The people of Changbai County, who have suffered an average of three bombs a day for fourteen days, are giving a strong answer to the American bandits with resolute actions. On the fourth day after the bombing of Badagou Village, eight farmers went to the Korean battlefield to settle accounts with the American bandits, and fifteen young people from neighboring villages also set off together.

　　埋葬了死难同胞、缴纳了公粮
    长白山区农民奋起复仇
    【新华社沈阳二十四日电】遭受美国飞机频繁轰炸扫射的长白山区农民正在燃烧着愤怒的复仇火焰。自十一月一日至十四日止，美国飞机侵入长白山区沿鸭绿江北岸辑安、临江、长白等三县的上空达五十二次之多，其中并有八次轰炸和扫射。长白山区人民把这些血债都记在心里。
    在辑安县黄柏甸惹区农民集资埋葬了死难的桦皮甸子村农民于秀亭以后，已有数千人收拾好行装，即将参加抗美援朝保家卫国志愿部队或担任军事运输工作。为了增加祖国的国防经济力量，全区农民已在十天内把四万五千九百斤公粮缴纳完毕。
    被美机打伤的临江县苇沙河区二道沟村农民王显堂，经全区人民集资五百余万元为其治疗，伤口即将痊愈，他表示出院后就要到朝鲜去找美国鬼子报仇，他的父亲王作盛也正在收拾船只，要为志愿部队服务。全临江县的人民提出了“为王显堂报仇”的口号，青年们参加了民兵组织，在祖国国防最前线上，手持武器，日夜巡防。另有数百付担架，已准备妥当，要过江支援朝鲜人民的抗美战争。
    在十四天内平均每天遭受三枚炸弹轰炸的长白县受灾的人民，正用坚决的行动给美国强盗们以有力的回答。八道沟村在被炸后的第四天，有八个农民到朝鲜战场上去找美国强盗算账，邻村十五名青年也一齐出发。
