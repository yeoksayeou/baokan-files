Xinhua News Agency, 9th Dispatch: TASS dispatch: The General Headquarters of the Korean People's Democratic Republic Army announced in a battle report on the 8th that: People's Army troops continued to actively fight against U.S. troops and South Korean troops on all fronts.

　　People's Army troops are engaging in fierce battles with U.S. troops on the Chongchon River and continue to annihilate enemy troops encircled north of Anju.

　　On the east coast, north of Hamhung, Bukchong, and Songjin, fighting is still taking place in the original areas.

　　Xinhua News Agency, 9th Dispatch: The people in the enemy-occupied areas of Korea, unable to endure the oppression of the U.S. and Syngman Rhee bandit troops, are spontaneously joining guerrilla forces to kill the enemy. According to the Korean Central News Agency: Ahn Hyung-guk, a resident of Munchon-ri, Munchon County, Gangwon Province, and four young men from his village broke through the enemy's heavy encirclement on October 27 and arrived in a certain area of the Republic. After staying for a few days, they returned to a certain guerrilla unit.

　　When Ahn Hyung-guk talked about the atrocities of the U.S. military and the people's struggle against them, he said: The U.S. military are evil demons in human skin. Since the enemies occupied our village, they have continuously humiliated women, killed livestock, and massacred innocent people. Day and night, in groups of twos and threes, the U.S. military ordered the so-called "National Defense Forces" to lead the way and search the village. They drove away all pigs, cattle, and other livestock to slaughter and eat. Crops in mountainous areas were looted, and grain that could not be taken away was doused with gasoline and burned.

　　Under these circumstances, the people in the village realized the truth that they could only survive by destroying the enemy as soon as possible from the lessons of blood. Therefore, the farmers launched a heroic struggle to protect grain, protect women, and prevent the enemy from massacring innocent people. Many young people have already left the village for the guerrilla areas. Women and old people have also gone to the mountains with the determination to take revenge. Residents who remain in the village are secretly organizing self-defense commando teams. They maintain close contact with the guerrillas, provide grain to the guerrillas, and obtain weapons from the guerrillas.

　　On the night of September 15th, two U.S. soldiers and one puppet National Defense soldier broke into my older brother's house, fired their guns wildly, and demanded women. At this moment, two young men ran over and began to fight the enemy empty-handed, killing one U.S. soldier and one puppet soldier. The other U.S. soldier who ran back led more than twenty U.S. soldiers back to arrest us. Knowing that the U.S. military would definitely retaliate, our whole family fled the village in the dark of night. Enraged by not catching us, the U.S. military set fire to more than ten houses near my home. I met Kang Chang-sik, who lives in our neighboring village, who also escaped to this place after killing two "National Defense soldiers" with a sickle who were trying to set fire to a grain pile.

　　朝人民军在清川江与美军进行激战
    继续包围歼灭安州以北敌军
    敌占区人民不堪蹂躏纷纷参加游击队
    【新华社九日讯】塔斯社讯：朝鲜民主主义人民共和国人民军总司令部八日发表战报称：人民军部队在各战线继续与美军和南朝鲜军积极作战。
    人民军部队在清川江与美军进行猛烈的战斗，并继续歼灭在安州以北被包围的敌军。
    在东海岸的咸兴，北青和城津以北，战斗仍在原来的地区进行。
    【新华社九日讯】朝鲜敌占区的人民，不堪美、李匪军的蹂躏，正纷纷自动参加游击队杀敌。据朝鲜中央通讯社讯：居住江原道文川县文川区的安亨国和他同村的四位青年，于十月二十七日冲破敌军的重重包围，到达共和国某地，于停留数日后即回到某地游击队中去。
    安亨国谈及美军的暴行和人民反对美军暴行的斗争时说：美军就是人面兽心的恶鬼。敌人们自侵占我们村庄以后，不断地凌辱妇女，杀死牲口和虐杀无辜人民。美军不分昼夜，三两成群地命令所谓“国防军”带路到村里来搜查。他们赶走所有猪、牛等牲口，去杀掉吃掉。山岳地带的庄稼都被抢走，不能拉走的粮食也被洒上汽油烧掉了。
    在这种情况下，村里的人民从血的教训中，认识了只有尽早消灭仇敌才能生存的真理。因此农民们展开了为保护粮食、保护妇女和不使敌人虐杀无辜人民的英勇斗争。已经有很多青年离开村庄走向游击区。妇女和老年人也抱着复仇的决心到山上去了。留在村里的居民则秘密地组织起自卫突击队。他们跟游击队取得紧密的联系，将粮食供给游击队，同时从游击队那里取得武器。
    九月十五日夜晚，两个美军和一个伪国防军进到我哥哥家里乱放枪，并要妇女。正在这时，外面跑来了两个青年，赤手空拳地开始和敌人搏斗，打死了一个美军和一个伪军。跑回去的另外一个美军，带领二十多个美军转来抓我们。我们知道美军一定要来报复的，全家人早趁着黑夜跑出了村庄。因为没抓住我们而恼羞成怒的美军，就放火烧毁了我家附近十余户的房屋。我到此间，见到住在我们邻村的姜昌植，他也是以镰刀砍死两名要到粮食堆放火的“国防军”而逃到此地的。
