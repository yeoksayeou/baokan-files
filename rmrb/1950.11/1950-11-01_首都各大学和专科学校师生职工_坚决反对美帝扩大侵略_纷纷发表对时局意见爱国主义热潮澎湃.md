Reported by this newspaper: The flames of aggressive war ignited by U.S. imperialists have reached the border of our Northeast. U.S. imperialist naval and air forces have already occupied our territory of Taiwan, violated our Northeast airspace and the coast of Shandong. This series of acts of aggression has aroused the anger of teachers, students, and staff in universities and technical schools in the capital.

	Focused on the current situation in Korea
	Widespread Current Affairs Discussions Unfold

Current affairs propaganda and discussion have formed a surge in various institutions. At the North China People's Revolutionary University, North China Institute of Technology, Peking University, Tsinghua University, Normal University, Yenching University, Beijing Management Institute of Jiaotong University, Fu Jen Catholic University, and other institutions, most students and many professors and staff actively participated in discussions through department meetings, class meetings, study group chats, and various forms of symposiums, filled with the sentiment of hating U.S. imperialism's expansion of the war of aggression. In dormitories, on playgrounds, on roads, in every corner, people were talking. At Beijing Agricultural University, on the evening of October 22nd, over 300 students attended a symposium held by the current affairs study group in the auditorium. Many students at the meeting requested to join the current affairs group and asked the student union to expand the organization. Current affairs discussions also unfolded enthusiastically on wall newspapers and large-character posters. Opinions discussed in various units were also disseminated through large-character posters. Along with large-character posters, broadcasts, cartoons, slogans, commentaries, inspirational poems, war situation maps, and material clippings formed a powerful weapon to expose the atrocities of U.S. imperialism and convey the angry voices of teachers and students. The "Democracy Wall" at Peking University was already overflowing, and wooden beds used for sleeping were even brought out as temporary bulletin boards. Sheets of large-character posters with ink still wet were plastered over yesterday's posters. Tsinghua University opened a "Current Affairs Corridor," and the "Democracy Wall" with a glorious history of struggle was also restored. Students crowded in front of every large-character poster and cartoon. The publications issued by the first and fourth branches of the North China People's Revolutionary University published "A History of U.S. Imperialist Aggression Against China" and a list of American war criminals; many students copied it into their notebooks and promoted the essence of U.S. imperialist aggression to the masses.

The entertainment activities of various schools are also being conducted around the theme of opposing U.S. imperialism's expansion of aggression. The Peking University Drama Society is rushing to rehearse its own play, "Unsubmissive Seoul." The dance group is stepping up rehearsals of a dance skit with the theme of exposing the atrocities of U.S. imperialist aggression. The choir has selected songs such as "Song of the Asian People's War" and "Oppose the War of Aggression," extensively mobilizing students throughout the school to practice singing.

Yenching University also focused on discussing the current international situation at the Second Student Representative Assembly held on October 21st and 22nd.

	The Brutality of U.S. Imperialism Exceeds that of the Japanese寇
	We Can No Longer Endure It

In discussions and propaganda, students recounted the aggressive atrocities of U.S. imperialism: after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, it helped the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang massacre tens of millions of Chinese people; on June 25th of this year, it instigated the Syngman Rhee puppet government to launch a war of aggression in Korea, and then personally took up the butcher knife to stain Korea with blood; at the same time, it sent its Seventh Fleet to occupy our territory of Taiwan, destroy our navigational rights, and obstruct our shipping. U.S. planes invading Korea repeatedly intruded into our Northeast airspace and the coast of Shandong; U.S. warships shelled and illegally searched our merchant ships. Most recently, it has even more frantically pushed the invading Korean troops to our border, seriously threatening our national security. At the current affairs symposium for Tsinghua University union cadres, Mr. Chen Qinghua further listed historical facts to prove that the ambition and actions of U.S. imperialism to invade our country and Korea began decades ago, in the time of our grandfathers and great-grandfathers.

When analyzing the crimes of U.S. imperialism, teachers and students in various schools naturally linked the current U.S. imperialist conspiracy of aggression with the past atrocities of Japanese寇, and believed that the brutality of U.S. imperialism exceeds that of the Japanese寇. The discussions among the delegates at the Second Student Representative Assembly of Yenching University pointed out: Today's actions of U.S. imperialism in Korea cannot help but make us think of the invasion of Northeast China by Japan in 1931. The announcement to all students from this meeting said: "This tense situation clearly shows that U.S. imperialism is following the path taken by Japanese imperialism during the 'September 18th' Incident. At that time, Japanese imperialism followed the route of Korea and Northeast China to invade China step by step." A student in the Chemistry Department of Peking University said: "My father was killed by Japanese寇 when they invaded our country. I hate Japanese寇, and I hate the Kuomintang reactionaries; but now I hate U.S. imperialism even more, because the path U.S. imperialism is now taking is exactly the path that Japanese寇 took before!" Jiang Shuixin, a student in Civil Engineering IV at Tsinghua University, said: "U.S. imperialism is following the old path of Japanese寇. Japanese寇 was our most ferocious enemy, and U.S. imperialism is also the most ferocious enemy. We must hate U.S. imperialism as we hate Japanese寇." The students of Chemistry I at Fu Jen Catholic University shouted even louder: Have we forgotten the painful lessons that history has taught us? Japanese fascists used Korea as a springboard to invade our Northeast, North China, and even South China. These bloody facts are still vivid; and today, U.S. imperialists are following the old path of Japanese fascists, invading the Korean people and invading the Chinese people. We can no longer ignore this issue! We can no longer endure it.

	In Our Free Land
	War Profiteers Are Not Allowed to Set Fires

In the discussions, when students talked about today's peaceful and happy life, they hated the aggression of U.S. imperialism even more. A student at Normal University wrote in the poem "We Must Fight": "People who have broken free from shackles, who would be willing to be slaves again! In our free land, we will never allow war profiteers to set fires!"

At a department meeting held by the Chemistry Department of Peking University on the 27th, one student said: "During the summer vacation, I went to work in a factory in the Northeast. We watched our motherland embark on the road to construction. I was determined to work hard for the construction of our motherland after graduation. Unexpectedly, U.S. imperialism will not allow us to build our motherland in peace. Now it has destroyed the happy lives of the Korean people and also destroyed our peaceful lives. How can this not make people angry!" All the students of the History Department of Normal University wrote on Chairman Mao's book: "We want to study, but the enemy is already standing at our door; we want peaceful construction, but the enemy's bombs have already exploded on our land. We are young people with hot blood, we cannot watch the Korean people being slaughtered, we cannot watch our compatriots being strafed, and the peaceful Northeast being destroyed!" Fifty-one female students from the Second Branch of Normal University also said in a letter signed to Chairman Mao: In order to become excellent female teachers of the people in the future, we are now following your instructions, studying hard, and doing a good job in our profession. However, the crazy and shameless acts of aggression by U.S. imperialism not only threaten our peaceful learning, but also simply destroy the construction of our motherland. This shameless act of aggression by U.S. imperialists has aroused our immense anger. In order to eliminate the scourge to human peace, we resolutely respond to any call you make. For the integrity of the motherland's territory and for lasting world peace, we are determined to dedicate all the strength that Chinese young women possess.

	When the Motherland Needs Us
	We Will Spare No Sacrifice

The confidence and determination of teachers, students, and staff in various schools to defeat any aggressive provocations by invaders are extremely strong. The Yenching University Student Representative Assembly said in a notice to all students: "We will always stand on the side of the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union. We have the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, the heroic and powerful People's Liberation Army that defeated the eight million troops of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and the support of the peace-loving people of China and the world. It is an unparalleled force that can repel any imperialist offensive." Zhang Yinsheng, a veteran studying at the Fourth Branch of the North China People's Revolutionary University, said indignantly: "Although I shed blood four times in the War of Resistance Against Japan, my blood has not been shed completely. I am a Communist Party member. I have no personal concerns. When the motherland needs it, I will spare no sacrifice."

	We Are as Close as Lips and Teeth with Korea
	We Must Not Sit Idly by and Watch U.S. Imperialism Invade Korea

Regarding the aggressive atrocities of U.S. imperialism against Korea, students in various schools warmly supported the statement in Premier Zhou's speech: "The Chinese people will never tolerate foreign aggression, nor can they allow imperialists to invade their neighbors at will and turn a blind eye." Mr. Tang Yongtong, Chairman of the Peking University School Board, said: The intention of U.S. imperialism to invade Korea is clearly to attack China. We cannot ignore it. Other professors also expressed the same opinions. At a current affairs symposium of the Second Branch of the Tsinghua University Union, most members believed that the war of U.S. imperialism's aggression against Korea is not only a struggle between two countries, but a struggle between the imperialist camp and the peace and democracy camp. We must not sit idly by and watch the disasters suffered by the Korean people. The interests of the Korean people are consistent with the interests of peace-loving people all over the world, especially the interests of the Chinese people.

Speakers in the discussion at the Beijing Management Institute of Jiaotong University and the call of the school's student union believed that during the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Korean people gave the Chinese people great help; the people of China and Korea have deep friendship and a close relationship like flesh and blood, how can we ignore it and stand by when the Korean people are in distress?

Now students in various schools are paying close attention to the aggressive behavior of U.S. imperialism. The patriotic surge against U.S. imperialist aggression continues to rise in various schools.

　　首都各大学和专科学校师生职工
    坚决反对美帝扩大侵略  
    纷纷发表对时局意见爱国主义热潮澎湃
    【本报讯】美帝国主义者扩大侵略的战争火焰，已经燃烧到我国东北边境。美帝国主义的海、空军已经侵占我国领土台湾，侵犯我国东北领空和山东沿海。这一系列的侵略暴行，激起了首都各大学和专科学校师生职工的愤怒。
    针对目前朝鲜形势
    普遍展开时事讨论
    时事宣传和讨论，在各院校形成热潮。华北人民革命大学、华北工学院、北京大学、清华大学、师范大学、燕京大学、交通大学北京管理学院、辅仁大学等院校，通过系会、班会、学习小组的漫谈会和各种方式的座谈会，大部分同学和不少教授、职工都积极参加讨论，充满了痛恨美帝扩大侵略战争的情绪。在宿舍里，在操场上，在路上，在每个角落里，都有人在谈论着。北京农业大学，十月二十二日晚，三百多同学在大礼堂参加了时事学习小组举行的漫谈会。会上有许多同学要求参加时事组，并要求学生会扩大这个组织。时事讨论，也在墙报、大字报上热烈展开。各个单位讨论的意见，也通过大字报传播开来。和大字报一起，广播、漫画、标语、评论、鼓动诗、战争形势地图、资料剪辑，形成了一个揭露美帝暴行，传达师生愤怒呼声的强有力的武器，北京大学“民主墙”上已容纳不下了，睡觉用的木床也被抬出来作为临时的布告板。一张张墨迹未干的大字报，压在昨天贴出的大字报上。清华大学开辟了“时事走廊”，有着光荣斗争历史的“民主墙”也恢复了起来。同学们拥在每张大字报和漫画前面。华北人民革命大学一、四支部出版的刊物上登载了“美帝侵华史”及美国战争罪犯们的名单；不少同学把它抄在笔记本上，并向群众宣传美帝侵略的本质。
    各校娱乐活动，也在围绕着反对美帝扩大侵略的主题进行。北大剧艺社正赶排自己创作的话剧《不屈服的汉城》。舞蹈组加紧排演以暴露美帝侵略暴行为主题的舞蹈活报剧。合唱团选择了《亚洲人民战歌》、《反对侵略战争》等歌曲，广泛发动全校同学练习歌唱。
    燕京大学在十月二十一日和二十二日举行的第二届学生代表大会上，也着重讨论了目前的国际形势。
    美帝的残暴甚于日寇
    我们再也不能忍受了
    讨论中，宣传中，同学们历数了美帝的侵略暴行：抗日胜利后，它曾经帮助蒋介石匪帮屠杀了千千万万的中国人民；今年六月二十五日指使李承晚傀儡政府在朝鲜发动侵略战争，继而亲自拿起屠刀把朝鲜染成一片血土；同时派遣其第七舰队侵占我国领土台湾，破坏我国航海权，阻挠我国航运。侵朝美机三番五次地侵入我东北领空和山东沿海；美舰炮击并非法盘查我国商船。最近更疯狂地将侵朝军队推向我国边境，严重地威胁着我国安全。清华工会干部时事座谈会上，陈庆华先生更列述史实，证明美帝侵略我国及朝鲜的野心和行动，早在几十年前，我们祖父、曾祖父的时代就开始了。
    在分析美帝的罪恶时，各校师生都很自然地把今天的美帝侵略阴谋，和过去日寇的侵略暴行联系起来，并认为美帝残暴甚于日寇。燕大第二届学生代表大会上代表们的讨论中指出：今天美帝在朝鲜的行动，不得不使我们想到一九三一年日本向东北进行的侵略。该会告全体同学书中说：“这样紧张的局势，明显地表示出美帝国主义正走着“九一八”时日本帝国主义所走过的路线。当时，日本帝国主义就是循着朝鲜、东北这条路线，步步侵略中国的。”北大化学系一位同学说：“我的父亲在日本侵入我们祖国时，被日寇杀死了，我痛恨日寇，痛恨国民党反动派；然而现在我更痛恨美帝，因为现在美帝所走的道路正是日寇以前所走的道路！”清华大学土四的蒋水心同学说：“美帝正走着日寇的故道。日寇是我们最凶恶的敌人，而美帝也是最凶恶的敌人，我们要和仇视日寇一样地仇视美帝。”辅大化一同学们更大声疾呼地说：我们难道忘了历史给我们的惨痛教训了吗？日本法西斯主义者以朝鲜为跳板，侵占了我东北、华北，以至华南。这些血淋淋的事实，犹如在目前；而今天美帝国主义者，又踏着日本法西斯的旧路，在侵略朝鲜人民，侵略中国人民。我们不能再忽视这个问题！我们再也不能忍受了。
    在我们自由的国土上
    决不允许战贩来放火
    同学们在讨论中，说到今日和平幸福的生活时，更加痛恨美帝的侵略。师大一位同学在《我们要战斗》的诗中写道：“挣脱了枷锁的人们，谁愿意重新作奴隶！在我们自由的国土上，我们决不允许战贩放火！”
    北大化学系二十七日举行的系会上，有一位同学说：“暑期我曾到东北工厂实习。我们眼看着祖国已走上了建设的道路。我曾决心在毕业后为祖国建设事业而奋斗。不想美帝不让我们在和平中建设我们的祖国，现在它破坏了朝鲜人民的幸福生活，也破坏了我们的和平生活，这怎能不使人愤怒！”师大历史系全体同学在上毛主席书上写道：“我们要读书，但是敌人已经站在我们的大门口；我们要和平建设，但是敌人的炸弹已经在我们的国土上爆炸。我们是有热血的青年，我们不能看着朝鲜人民被屠杀，我们不能看着自己的同胞被扫射，和平的东北遭破坏！”师大二院五十一位女同学签名给毛主席的信中也说：我们为了在将来成为优秀的人民女教师，现在正遵循着您的指示，努力学习，搞好业务。可是美帝国主义疯狂无耻的侵略行为，不但威胁着我们的和平学习，而且简直是破坏我们祖国的建设事业。美帝国主义者的这种无耻侵略行为，激起了我们无比的愤怒。为了要消灭对于人类和平的祸害，我们坚决响应您的任何号召。为了祖国领土的完整，为了世界的持久和平，我们决心献出一切中国女青年所具有的力量。
    祖国需要我们的时候
    我们将不惜任何牺牲
    各校师生员工对击败侵略者的任何侵略挑衅的信心和决心是异常坚强的。燕大学生代表大会告全体同学书中说：“我们永远站在以苏联为首的和平民主阵营一边，我们有毛主席和共产党的领导，有着战胜蒋介石匪帮八百万军队的英勇强大的人民解放军，我们有全中国和全世界爱好和平人民的支援，是一支无比的力量，可以击退任何帝国主义的进攻。”北大医学院工会的抗议通电中深切相信：今天中国人民已打败了日寇和蒋介石匪帮，坚强地站起来了。美帝如果轻举妄动，胆敢扩大侵略战争，它将重蹈日寇和蒋匪帮自取灭亡的覆辙！在华北人民革命大学四支部学习的荣誉军人张寅生激愤地说：“我虽在抗日战争中流过四次血，但我的血并未流尽。我是一个共产党员。我没有任何的个人顾虑，当祖国需要的时候，我将不惜任何牺牲。”
    我们与朝鲜唇齿相依
    决不能坐视美帝侵朝
    对于美帝侵略朝鲜的暴行，各校同学都热烈拥护周外长演说中所说的：“中国人民决不能容忍外国的侵略，也不能听任帝国主义者对自己的邻人肆行侵略而置之不理。”北大校委会主席汤用彤先生说：美帝侵略朝鲜的意图，显然是进攻中国。我们不能置之不理。其他教授们也纷纷发表了同样的意见。清华大学工会第二分会时事座谈会上，多数会员认为美帝侵略朝鲜的战争，不仅是两国间的斗争，而是帝国主义阵营与和平民主阵营之间的斗争。朝鲜人民所遭受的灾难，我们决不能坐视不理。朝鲜人民的利益，与全世界爱好和平的人民的利益，特别是中国人民的利益是一致的。
    交大北京管理学院讨论会中的发言者和该校学生会的号召中认为：抗日战争中，朝鲜人民给了中国人民以很大的帮助；中朝两国人民有着深厚的友谊和骨肉相连的关系，现在朝鲜人民在急难中，我们怎能置之不理，袖手旁观呢？
    现在各校同学都在密切注意着美帝的侵略行为。反对美帝侵略的爱国热潮，在各校继续高涨着。
