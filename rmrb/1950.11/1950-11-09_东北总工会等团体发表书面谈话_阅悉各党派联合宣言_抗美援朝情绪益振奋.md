Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 6th: The people of all circles in the Northeast were greatly encouraged upon reading the joint declaration issued by the democratic parties of China on the 4th.

　　The Northeast Federation of Trade Unions, representing more than one million workers in private enterprises in the Northeast, issued a written statement on the 5th, which stated: "Our workers in the Northeast saw the conspiracy of American imperialism to first occupy Korea and Taiwan and then invade the Northeast long ago. We have long been angered by the crimes of American planes invading our national airspace and killing our compatriots. The patriotic production competition for resisting America and aiding Korea has become a comprehensive mass movement. Many workers have also expressed their willingness to directly support the Korean People's Liberation War by undertaking military transportation, air defense, communications, telecommunications liaison, battlefield rescue and other actions. Today, when our just demands have been agreed to and supported by all democratic parties in the country, we feel extremely excited. We will accelerate the transformation of our aspirations into practical actions."

　　The Northeast Committee of the New Democratic Youth League, representing one million youths and 520,000 Youth League members in the Northeast, issued a written statement stating: "The Youth League members in the Northeast will unswervingly and resolutely abide by this declaration, including our own will, and use various voluntary actions to support the Korean people in defeating the aggression of American imperialism, defending the motherland, defending our hometowns, and defending the great future of our youth."

　　The Northeast Democratic Women's Federation issued a written statement saying: "Our 20 million women in the Northeast, who have rich experience in supporting the Northeast People's Liberation War, will exert their strength in battlefield rescue, hospital care, sewing military uniforms, and sending their husbands and sons to Korea to participate in the war, to realize their aspirations to resist America, aid Korea, defend their homes and defend the country."

　　The Northeast General Branch of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association also pointed out in a written statement: "Our 1.2 million members will contribute all their strength in various voluntary actions to resist America and aid Korea."

　　In addition, the Northeast Association of Health Workers, the Shenyang Federation of Trade Unions, the Shenyang Youth Federation, and other people's organizations have also issued written statements expressing their determination to volunteer to resist America and aid Korea.
