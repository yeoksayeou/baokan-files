Xinhua News Agency, November 11th: Cai Chang, Chairman of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, recently sent a letter to French Prime Minister Pleven, expressing indignation and protest against the French government's atrocities in persecuting Spanish nationals in France; at the same time, she also sent a letter to Dolores Ibárruri, Vice-President of the Women's International Democratic Federation, expressing that all Chinese women, under the leadership of the Women's International Democratic Federation, will strive for the lasting peace and democracy of the people of the world. The full texts of the two letters are as follows:

            Letter to Dolores Ibárruri
    Dear Mrs. Dolores Ibárruri:

    When we read your telegram accusing the French government of persecuting Spanish democrats in France, we were filled with indignation. We would like to extend our warm respect and sincere condolences to the persecuted Spanish comrades, their families, and their comrades.

    The despicable and illegal actions of the Pleven-Moch government have once again exposed their reactionary nature in front of the people of France and the world, once again exposing that they are accomplices of the executioner Franco, loyal servants of the American imperialists, and also showing their fear of the growing peace movement around the world.

    Their exile to Africa of those great internationalist Spanish anti-fascist fighters who once fought for the liberation of France is a morally unacceptable act of ingratitude and an insult to the revolutionary tradition of the French nation.

    Everyone knows that this is not the first time the French bourgeois government has betrayed the Spanish people. Everyone still remembers the shameful "non-intervention" policy, the tragic consequences of which caused unprecedented devastation throughout Europe and cost the world the precious lives of millions.

    Today, the situation in Europe and the world is completely different from the time of the Spanish Civil War. The strength of the peace camp led by the Soviet Union and the upsurge of the people's movement in capitalist countries are strong enough to defeat the conspiracies and actions of a small group of warmongers. The wheel of history will never turn back, and no one can stop the development of history.

    Warmongers and their minions, in order to achieve their arrogant attempt to dominate the world, do not hesitate to submerge the world in a sea of blood, but the flames of anger of the awakened people have already burned at their feet, and the judgment of history will soon fall on their own heads.

    Dear Dolores Ibárruri, as you said, the French government's brutal suppression cannot be silenced by all people who advocate justice around the world.

    The sisters in France have already taken action first, and women all over the world will rise up to support the actions of our beloved Spanish and French sisters in various ways.

    We Chinese women clearly recognize that the French government's unreasonable and brutal actions are part of the American-led imperialist group's aggression. In addition to serious protests, we must also increase our vigilance and efforts, and resolutely resist the aggression of American imperialism with practical actions to defend our homes and defend world peace and security.

    Dear Dolores Ibárruri, no matter how rampant and arrogant the thugs of Franco, Pleven, and Moch are, we firmly believe that under your wise leadership and encouragement, the Spanish people's struggle for a free and democratic Spain will surely achieve final victory.

    Here, let me once again represent all Chinese women to express our respect and concern to you, the glorious and shining example of women, and wish you good health.

                              Cai Chang, Chairman of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation

            Letter to French Prime Minister Pleven
    To French Prime Minister Mr. Pleven:

    From the letter of accusation from Dolores Ibárruri, Vice-President of the Women's International Democratic Federation, we learned that the French government has unreasonably exiled more than 300 Spanish democrats in France to Africa. These Spanish nationals are staunch anti-fascist fighters and once fought for the liberation of France.

    We are deeply indignant at the French government's atrocities. We believe that this is not only a persecution of Spanish peace-loving and democratic people, but also a provocation to the world's peaceful and democratic forces. In addition to supporting the persecuted in every way, we hereby lodge a serious protest with you and the French government, and resolutely demand the immediate revocation of this unreasonable measure and the release of the exiled Spanish democrats in France.

                             Cai Chang, Chairman of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation

　　我全国民主妇联主席蔡畅致函普利文
    抗议法政府迫害西班牙侨民
    并函国际妇联副主席伊巴露丽表示慰问
    【新华社十一日讯】中华全国民主妇女联合会主席蔡畅于日前致函法国总理普利文，对法国政府迫害旅法西班牙侨民的暴行表示愤慨和抗议；同时并致函国际民主妇联副主席陶乐列斯·伊巴露丽，表示全中国妇女将在国际民主妇联的领导下，为争取全世界人民的持久和平与民主而奋斗。两函全文如下：
            致陶乐列斯·伊巴露丽函亲爱的陶乐列斯·伊巴露丽夫人：
    当我们读到您控诉法国政府迫害侨法西班牙民主人士的电报时，我们是愤慨万状的。我们谨向遭受迫害的西班牙战友们和他们的家属以及他们的同志们，致热烈的敬意和衷心的慰问。
    普利文——莫克政府的这种卑鄙的非法行为，再次在法国和全世界人民面前暴露了他们反动的真面目，再次暴露了他们是刽子手佛朗哥的同伙，是美帝国主义者的忠实奴仆，同时也表明了他们对全世界日益壮大的和平运动的恐惧。
    他们把那些曾经为解放法国而战的伟大的国际主义的西班牙反法西斯战士们充军到非洲，是道德上所不能容许的忘恩负义行为，是对法兰西民族的革命传统之侮辱。
    谁都知道，法国资产阶级政府出卖西班牙人民，这并非是第一次了。每一个人都还记得那可耻的“不干涉”政策，这一政策的惨痛后果，是使整个欧洲遭受了空前浩劫，使全世界付出了千百万最宝贵生命的重大代价。
    今天欧洲和全世界的情势，和西班牙内战时期是完全不同了。以苏联为首的和平阵营的强大和资本主义国家内人民运动的高涨，是有足够力量击败一小撮战争贩子的阴谋和行动。历史的车轮永远不会倒退，任何人都不能阻止历史的发展。
    战争贩子和他们的佣仆们，为了达到统治世界的狂妄企图，不惜把全世界淹没在血海中，但是觉醒了的人民的愤怒火焰已经烧到他们的脚下，历史的裁判就要轮到他们自己头上了。
    亲爱的陶乐列斯·伊巴露丽，对于法国政府这种残暴的镇压，正如您说的：全世界主张正义的人士都不能缄默的。
    法国的姊妹们已经首先行动起来了，全世界的妇女们都会起来用各种方法声援我们敬爱的西班牙和法国的姊妹们的行动。
    我们中国妇女清楚认识法国政府这种无理暴行，是美国为首的帝国主义集团的侵略行动之一部分，我们除了严重抗议外，还要更加提高我们的警惕和努力，并以实际行动坚决抵抗美帝国主义的侵略，以保家卫国，并捍卫全世界的和平与安全。
    敬爱的陶乐列斯·伊巴露丽，不管佛朗哥、普利文、莫克这批暴徒如何嚣张蛮横，我们深信，在您的英明领导和鼓舞下，西班牙人民为争取一个自由、民主的西班牙的斗争，一定会得到最后胜利的。
    在这里，让我再一次代表全中国妇女向您，妇女们的光荣和光辉的榜样，表示我们的尊崇和关怀，并祝您健康。
                              中华全国民主妇女联合会主席  蔡畅
            致法国普利文总理函法国总理普利文先生：
    由国际民主妇联副主席陶乐列斯·伊巴露丽的控诉信中，我们获悉法国政府把三百余名西班牙侨法民主人士无理充军到非洲去。这些西班牙侨民都是坚决的反法西斯战士，并曾为解放法国而战。
    对于法国政府的这种暴行，我们深为愤慨。我们认为：这不但是对西班牙爱好和平与民主人士的一种迫害，也是对全世界和平民主力量的挑衅。我们除了用一切办法支援被迫害者外，特向你及法国政府提出严重抗议，并坚决要求立即撤销此项无理措施，释放被流放的侨法西班牙民主人士。
                             中华全国民主妇女联合会主席  蔡畅
