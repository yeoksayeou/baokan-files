Those Who Listen to "Voice of America" Spread Rumors Everywhere
    Suggest Government Should Effectively Handle This
    Letter from Xie Caimin, Peking University

    To the Editor:
    Recently, there have been many rumors, all absurd and groundless: some undermine the prestige of the People's Government, some create fear of America, and there are also various superstitious and treasonous remarks, even changing the guise of traitors and reactionary arguments of Wang Jingwei, Chen Lifu, and Chiang Kai-shek and spreading them everywhere. These rumors often appear in various places simultaneously, obviously spread by special agents. Tracing the source, it often comes from "hearing it from others"; many intellectuals, however, hear it from the "Voice of America" broadcast.
    What is the "Voice of America"? It is the voice of American imperialism, the voice of warmongers, the voice of our people's enemy, the voice of enslaving the people, the voice of destroying peace, and the voice of special agents. Why should we, the people who defend peace and love our motherland, listen to the nonsense of warmongers? China has local People's Broadcasting Stations, Moscow also has broadcasts in Chinese, and various New Democratic countries also frequently broadcast news about New China and world news. Why not listen to these but listen to the enemy's clamor? Is the content of the People's Broadcasting Station not enough to listen to? Is the content of the People's Daily not enough to read? Why listen to the propaganda of American special agents?
    After listening to the enemy's propaganda, they even "spread" it, "broadcast" it in small circles, and even "discuss" it among friends. Isn't this acting as "volunteer propagandists" for the enemy, for the warmongers, for the special agents? I believe this is an act of undermining the people's interests, this is a counter-revolutionary act.
    I request the public security organs to effectively handle the "volunteer propagandists" of the "Voice of America" and suppress them in the same way as the rumor-mongering special agents. Some rumors may be spread by special agents everywhere under the guise of the Voice of America. We do not allow reactionary elements to speak or act recklessly.
    I request the people of the whole country to give "reckless talkers" public opinion sanctions and investigate them.

　　收听“美国之音”者到处造谣
    建议政府应予以有效处理

    编辑同志：
    近来谣言很多，都是荒唐无稽：有的破坏人民政府威信，有的制造恐美情绪，还有各种迷信和卖国言论，甚至把汪精卫、陈立夫、蒋介石之流的汉奸反动论调，改头换面，到处流传。这些谣言常在各处同时发现，显然是有特务分子造谣。追究来源，多是“听别人说的”；有很多知识分子则是听“美国之音”广播来的。
    “美国之音”是什么呢？它是美帝国主义之音，是战争贩子之音，是我们人民的敌人之音，是奴化人民之音，是破坏和平之音，是特务之音。我们保卫和平、爱护祖国的人民为什么要听战争贩子的鬼话呢？中国各地有人民广播电台，莫斯科也有华语广播，各新民主主义国家也都经常广播新中国的消息和世界新闻，为什么不听这些而听敌人的叫嚣呢？难道人民广播电台的内容还不够听吗？人民日报上的内容还不够看吗？为什么要收听美国特务的宣传呢？
    听了敌人的宣传以后，还要在朋友当中“流传”、“小广播”，甚至“讨论”。这岂不是替敌人、替战争贩子、替特务作“义务宣传员”吗？我认为这是破坏人民利益的行为，这是反革命的行为。
    我要求公安机关，对“美国之音”的“义务宣传员”，予以有效的处理，和造谣的特务一样地加以镇压。有些谣言可能是特务借美国之音的外衣到处流传。我们对于反动分子是不准他乱说乱动的。
    我要求全国人民，对“乱说”者给以舆论制裁，并加以追究。
