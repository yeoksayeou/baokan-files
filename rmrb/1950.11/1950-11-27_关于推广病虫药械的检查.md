　　For plant diseases and insect pests that seriously endanger agricultural production, in terms of prevention and control methods, in addition to improving farming techniques and manual control, the use of machinery and pesticides is very effective. This year, in order to promote new methods of preventing and controlling diseases and insect pests, a large number of pesticides and equipment were distributed in various regions of the country. From April to October, a total of 2,445,529 jin of pesticides and 58,917 sprayers and dusters were distributed to Hebei, Pingyuan, Shanxi, Chahar, Suiyuan and other major regions. Among the various pesticides, some were insecticides and some were seed disinfectants for disease prevention, so the promotion areas were also different. In Hebei Province, because more cotton is planted, in order to help farmers vigorously eliminate cotton aphids and red spiders, more than 22,000 sprayers were sent to the province. In Chahar Province, because wheat diseases are serious, more than 98,000 jin of the disease-preventing pesticide "Ceresan" were sent to the province. In order to facilitate warm water soaking of seeds to prevent diseases, a total of 2,800 "thermometers" were issued for soaking seeds. In short, the number of pesticides and equipment promoted this year is unprecedented.
  I. The effect of pesticide and equipment control of diseases and insect pests
　　After the pesticides and equipment were distributed to various places, they began to play a role. For example, in Chabei, "Ceresan" was used for seed disinfection, and the incidence of wheat bunt was only 0.4 per thousand. Without "Ceresan" disinfection, the incidence rate reached about 80 percent. In addition, Gansu Province is a severely affected area of wheat bunt, with an infestation rate often reaching 50 to 80 percent. This year, "Guyin Lesheng" was used to disinfect 70,000 mu of seeds, with significant efficacy, and farmers responded well and requested the government to continue lending such pesticides. In terms of insect pest control, when cotton aphids broke out in Hebei this summer, the masses were organized to use sprayers in large quantities, which had great effect. In Handan Prefecture alone, there were more than 7,000 sprayers, which played a role in controlling cotton aphids, directly guaranteeing increased cotton production. Now local cotton farmers are asking the government to lend a large number of sprayers and pesticides. In the suburbs of Beijing, more than 50,000 mu of vegetables suffered from aphids this autumn, which was severely damaged, and the farmers were extremely anxious. After using pesticides (wettable 666) to control the aphids, they quickly died. Farmers in various villages requested the government to supply pesticides. In just over ten days, 3,000 sprayers and more than 36,000 jin of pesticides were lent out, allowing tens of thousands of mu of vegetables to escape the serious insect pests.

　　In the fruit tree area of Changli County, Hebei Province, insect pests have been very serious for many years. This spring, the Changli Plant Protection Station designated a demonstration area for controlling fruit tree insect pests in Liangshan Village, and organized local farmers to use sprayers and pesticides (wettable DDT) to control fruit tree insect pests (pear leafroller, pear fruit sawfly, peach curculio, codling moth, etc.). The effect was very significant. Among the 3,500 various fruit trees in the 330 mu orchard, no insect pests occurred at all. However, in the fruit tree areas of nearby villages, because no pesticides and equipment were used for prevention and control, all the trees were infested with insect pests, resulting in great losses. Under this obvious comparison of the two situations, the masses are convinced that pesticides and equipment can solve the problem. After this demonstration, a good foundation has been laid for the future promotion of pesticides and equipment in the fruit tree area.

　　This year, the use of pesticides and equipment to control locusts has also been promoted in key areas in various places. In the Yutai area of ​​Pingyuan Province, the masses were organized to use dusters and the pesticide "666" to poison flying locusts. After spraying, the locust pests were wiped out in more than 2,000 mu of farmland.
  II. How to promote pesticides and equipment
　　The use of pesticides and equipment to control plant diseases and insect pests in my country's rural areas is currently only in its initial stage. Although many pesticides and equipment have been promoted in various places this year, there is a lack of experience in specifically grasping this work in leadership. In addition, there is not enough understanding of the conditions in various places. Most areas do not have the habit of using pesticides and equipment, and the masses cannot specifically master the technology. As a result, many obstacles have naturally been encountered in the process of promoting pesticides and equipment, and many problems have occurred.

　　(1) Which areas should pesticides and equipment be promoted to? It is worthy of special attention. If we do not select key areas and do not follow the urgent needs of agricultural crops, randomly promoting them will not only fail to exert the role of pesticides and equipment, but will also create a waste phenomenon. This year, the result of average distribution and promotion in the areas where pesticides and equipment are promoted is that some areas are in urgent need but cannot be solved. According to this year's experience, areas where pesticides and equipment are relatively easy to promote are general fruit tree areas, vegetable areas, and cotton planting areas. For example, in the Changli fruit tree demonstration area in Hebei, the income from one mu of apples this year is as high as more than 10,000 jin of millet, and the average is more than several thousand jin, which is equivalent to the income from more than ten mu of food crops. Farmers believe that purchasing pesticides and equipment to control pests is a very cost-effective thing. In addition, in economic crop areas with relatively high incomes, such as the vegetable area in Beijing, more than 36,000 jin of pesticides were lent out in a few days. In the cotton planting area in Handan, Hebei, the masses felt that the use of pesticides and equipment to control cotton aphids was highly efficient and repeatedly requested the promotion of sprayers and pesticides.

　　(2) According to the results of the promotion of pesticides and equipment in various places this year, they can be lent or sold in three ways. The first is to mobilize farmers to purchase them themselves. Farmers with more fruit trees and cotton fields can control pests at any time if they have their own sprayers and pesticides. The second is to mobilize mutual aid groups to purchase shares. If there is too little land, each household does not need to have a sprayer alone, so they can organize to buy one together and use it together. Especially in areas with more insect pests in fruit trees, cotton, and vegetables, there will be a sprayer in the mutual aid group, which can solve many problems. Third, agricultural farms and agricultural extension agencies in various places should always have a portion of pesticides and equipment in order to allocate and use them when insect pests occur.

　　(3) In areas where there is no habit of using pesticides and equipment, the masses often have ideological concerns when they start to promote them, fearing that the pesticides will not be effective or will damage the crops. Therefore, several key areas should be planned and designated to conduct typical demonstrations of pesticides and equipment first. After prevention and control, let the farmers see the benefits of using pesticides and equipment, and then carry out universal promotion. For example, this year, the Changli Plant Protection Station adopted this method to control fruit tree insect pests.

　　(4) Which pesticides should be promoted? According to the pesticides promoted this year, there are more than ten kinds, the most important of which are "666", "DDT", "Ceresan", "Bordeaux mixture", "Rotenone", "Sodium fluorosilicate", etc. These pesticides have played a considerable role in the work of preventing and controlling plant diseases and insect pests, and should be continued to be promoted in a planned way. Especially "Ceresan" and "Bordeaux mixture" are very effective for preventing and controlling crop diseases, and the amount of medicine required per mu is small and the cost is not high, which is very easy for farmers to accept. For example, this is the reason why "Ceresan" can be widely promoted in Chahar this year. At present, due to the severity of underground pests, in addition to vigorously promoting "red alum", "sodium fluorosilicate" should also be promoted. According to the results of universal trials in Hebei Province, crops treated with "sodium fluorosilicate" to control mole crickets were not damaged.

　　(5) The promotion of agricultural machinery (such as sprayers) must be combined with repair work. For example, more than 50,000 sprayers distributed to various places this year often malfunctioned during use, directly hindering the work of preventing and controlling plant diseases and insect pests. In order to solve this problem, the work of repairing agricultural tools should be combined with the promotion of sprayers in areas where sprayers are widely promoted.

　　(6) Understanding the occurrence of plant diseases and insect pests and appropriately preparing and distributing pesticides and equipment is an important issue. According to the types of insect pests that occurred in North China this year, the supply of pesticides and equipment has not been able to target the urgent needs of each region and each period. For example, cotton red spiders and vegetable insect pests occurred in Hebei Province this year, and there was a deep sense of lack of pesticides and equipment. On the contrary, some areas have been distributed a lot of pesticides and equipment, but because it is not what the local area urgently needs, the result is that the pesticides and equipment cannot fully play their role, forming a waste. In order to correct this shortcoming, we must promptly grasp the situation of plant diseases and insect pests in the future, and further strengthen the organization and planning in the promotion of pesticides and equipment.

　　(7) The pesticides promoted this year are mostly purchased from abroad, and the cost is high. In order to vigorously promote the prevention and control of plant diseases and insect pests with pesticides in the future, we should use the existing insecticidal plants and minerals in various places to develop domestic pesticides in a planned way. For example, arsenic mines in Hunan, fluorine mines in Zhejiang and Shandong, and the manufacture of Bordeaux mixture in the Northeast region are all very important pesticides.
  III. Must master the technology of using pesticides and equipment
　　In order to promote pesticides and equipment to various places, the technology of using them must first be told to cadres and the masses so that they can be specifically used. In many areas this year, due to the lack of technical guidance, many deviations have occurred in the method of use, and even some losses have been suffered. For example, in individual areas of Jilin, Northeast China, because the propaganda did not explain clearly to the masses, some misused Bordeaux mixture to treat insects (not knowing that Bordeaux mixture can only be used for seed treatment to prevent diseases). Some people thought that the crops grown from disinfected seeds could not be eaten by people and animals in the future, so they buried the Bordeaux mixture and did not dare to use it. Some people thought that Bordeaux mixture could cure all diseases, so they used it to treat sores. In addition, with various concerns during use, many of the pesticides distributed did not work. In Nansha Ling Village, Yanggao County, Chahar Province, farmer Yang Cheng used "wettable 666" to spray fruit trees. Because the concentration was too high, drug damage occurred after spraying twenty trees. "Ceresan" was originally used for seed treatment to prevent diseases, but it was mistakenly used to treat insects in Pingyuan Province, and as a result, the insects and more than ten mu of crops were killed together. In addition, in some areas, pesticides were casually mixed and used, and as a result, many pesticides were sprayed without effect, forming a waste. In some areas, when the pesticides arrived, because the method of use was not clear, they did not dare to promote them to the masses, and only stored the pesticides.

　　According to the experience of using pesticides and equipment this year, the following points must be paid attention to in the promotion work:

　　(1) For the pesticides and equipment promoted to various places, there must be technicians to help farmers solve technical problems. For example, when Handan Prefecture, Hebei Province, promoted pesticides and equipment this year, short-term training courses were held in various counties, and more than 1,000 people learned simple methods of using pesticides and equipment. When cotton insect pests were serious, the pesticides and equipment fully played their role. When the suburbs of Beijing used pesticides and equipment to control vegetable insects, more than 30,000 mu of vegetable aphids were treated because someone directly helped in the technology. In particular, in areas where there is no habit of using pesticides and equipment, the masses have many ideological concerns, and technical propaganda and technical guidance should be strengthened.

　　(2) The pesticides promoted should be as simple as possible, and there should not be too many kinds, because if they are too complicated, farmers will not be able to master the technology. For example, more than ten kinds of pesticides were promoted this year, and some areas promoted several kinds at the same time. When they are specifically used, they cannot be identified.

　　(3) In order to avoid losses and reduce waste, drug efficacy tests should be carried out as soon as possible before using pesticides. Pesticides that are considered unreliable must not be blindly promoted. For example, the "Rotenone" promoted in some areas of Hebei this year has reduced its efficacy due to being stored for too long. As a result, the insecticidal efficacy is poor, and the masses have a bad reaction, directly hindering the future promotion of this pesticide.

　　关于推广病虫药械的检查
    中央农业部病虫害防治局
    对于严重危害农业生产的病虫害，在防治方法上，除改进耕作技术和人工防除外，使用器械和农药防治是非常有效的。今年在全国各地区，为了推广新的防除病虫方法，曾发出了大批的病虫药械，从四月开始到十月止共发到河北、平原、山西、察哈尔、绥远及其他各大区农药二百四十四万五千五百二十九斤，喷雾器及喷粉器五万八千九百一十七架，在各种农药中，一部分是杀虫剂，一部分是防病用的种子消毒药剂，因此在推广地区上也有所不同。在河北省因植棉较多，为了帮助农民大力扑灭棉蚜与红蜘蛛，全省共发去喷雾器二万二千余架，察哈尔省因小麦病害严重，全省发去防病农药“赛力散”九万八千余斤，为了便于进行温汤浸种防除病害，共发出浸种使用的“温度计”二千八百支。总之从今年推广的药械数量上看是空前的。
  一、药械防治病虫害的效果
    病虫药械分发各地以后，已开始发挥了作用，如察北用“赛力散”进行了种子消毒，小麦腥黑穗病发病率仅到千分之四，没有经过“赛力散”消毒的，发病率即达到百分之八十左右。另外在甘肃省是小麦腥黑穗病严重地区，为害率常达百分之五十至八十，今年使用了“谷仁乐生”进行种子消毒七万亩，药效显著，农民反映很好，要求政府继续贷放此类农药。在防除虫害工作上，河北今年夏季棉蚜大发生时，组织群众大量使用了喷雾器，收效甚大。仅邯郸一个专区，即有七千多架喷雾器，在防治棉花蚜虫上发挥作用，直接保证了棉花增产，现在当地植棉农户要求政府大量贷放喷雾器与农药。在北京市郊区，今年秋季有五万余亩蔬菜发生了蚜虫，被害甚重，农民极为焦急，经过使用农药（可湿性六六六）防治，蚜虫很快死去，各村农民均要求政府供应农药，仅十余日，即贷出喷雾器三千架，农药三万六千余斤，使数万亩蔬菜，脱离了严重的虫害。
    在河北省昌黎县果树区，历年以来，果树虫害即很严重，今年春季，昌黎病虫防治站，在两山村划定了一个防治果树虫害示范区，组织当地农民，使用喷雾器和农药（可湿性ＤＤＴ）防治果树虫害，（梨星毛虫、梨实蜂、桃象鼻虫、食心虫等）效果非常显著，在三百三十亩果树园中的三千五百棵各种果树，根本没有发生虫害。但在附近村庄果树区，因为没有使用药械防治，全遭虫害，损失甚大。在这两种情况明显对比下，群众深信药械能解决问题，经过这次示范，给今后在果树区的推广药械，打下了良好的基础。
    用药械防治蝗虫，今年在各地也进行了重点推广。在平原省鱼台地区，曾组织了群众使用喷粉器和农药“六六六”，毒杀飞蝗，经过喷射以后，在两千多亩的农田中，扑灭了蝗害。
  二、怎样推广药械
    在我国农村使用药械防治病虫害，目前还是一个开始阶段，今年在各地虽然推广了很多药械，但在领导上，对于这一工作具体掌握是缺乏经验的，加上对各地情况了解不够，大部分地区没有使用药械习惯，群众不能具体掌握技术，结果在药械推广过程中，自然就碰到不少障碍，发生了不少问题。
    （一）药械应向什么地区推广？是值得特别注意的，如果不选择重点，不按照农业作物的迫切需要，随便推广下去，不但不能发挥药械的作用，反会造成一种浪费现象，今年在推广药械地区上，由于平均分配推广的结果，形成有些地区群众迫切需要却没法解决，根据今年经验，药械比较容易推广的地区，是一般果树区、蔬菜区、及植棉区，如在河北昌黎果树示范区，今年一亩苹果的收入，有的高达万余斤小米，普通均在数千斤以上，约合十余亩食粮作物的收入，农民认为购买药械治虫是很合算的事。另外，收入比较多的经济作物区，如在北京蔬菜区，几天之中，即贷出农药三万六千余斤，在河北邯郸植棉区，群众感到使用药械治棉蚜效率高，一再请求推广喷雾器和农药。
    （二）根据今年各地推广药械结果，可分为三种方法去贷出或售出，第一是发动农民自购，在果树棉田较多的农户，自己有了喷雾器和农药，即可随时防治虫害。第二是发动互助组集股购买，如田地过少，每户不需要独有一架喷雾器的，即可组织起来伙买一架，互助使用，特别是在果树棉花蔬菜虫害较多地区，互助组内有了一架喷雾器，即可解决不少问题。第三各地农场及农业推广机关，应经常掌握一部分药械，以便当虫害发生时，调配使用。
    （三）没有使用药械习惯地区，在开始推广时群众思想多有顾虑，只怕用了农药不生效力，或把庄稼治坏，因此就应该有计划的划定几个重点区，先进行药械典型示范，经过防治，使农民看到使用药械的好处，再进行普遍推广，如今年昌黎病虫防治站，防治果树虫害就是采取了这种方法。
    （四）应推广那些农药？按今年推广的农药，共有十余种，最主要的有“六六六”“ＤＤＴ”“赛力散”“王铜”“鱼藤粉”“氟矽酸钠”等。这些农药在防治病虫工作中，已经起了相当作用，应该有计划的继续推广，特别是“赛力散”和“王铜”对于防治作物病害，是很有效果的，而且每亩需用药量少，花费不大，各地农民极容易接受，如今年在察哈尔，所以能够普遍推广“赛力散”就是这个原因。目前由于地下害虫的严重，除大量推广“红矾”外，“氟矽酸钠”也应该提倡使用，据河北省普遍试用结果，凡用“氟矽酸钠”防治蝼蛄虫的作物均无被害。
    （五）推广农械（如喷雾器）必须结合修理工作，如今年发到各地五万多架喷雾器，在使用过程中常发生故障，直接妨碍了病虫害防治工作，为了解决这一问题，在喷雾器推广较多地区，应该与修补农具工作结合进行。
    （六）了解病虫害发生情况，适当的准备及配发药械是一个重要问题，根据今年华北虫害的发生种类，在药械供应上，还未能针对着各地区、各时期的迫切需要，如今年河北省普遍发生棉花红蜘蛛及蔬菜虫害，深感到药械的缺乏，相反的有些地区配发了很多药械，因为并不是当地所迫切需要的，结果使药械不能充分发挥作用，形成了浪费。为了纠正此一缺点，今后必须及时掌握病虫害情况，进一步加强药械推广中的组织工作与计划性。
    （七）今年推广的农药，多从国外购入，成本较高，今后为了大量提倡药剂防除病虫，应该利用各地现有之杀虫植物和矿物质，有计划地发展国产农药，如湖南的砒矿，浙江、山东的氟矿，以及东北区王铜的制造，都是很重要的农药。
  三、必须掌握药械使用技术
    向各地推广病虫药械，必须先把使用技术告诉干部和群众，才能够具体运用起来。今年不少地区，由于缺乏技术指导，在使用方法上产生了许多偏差，甚至于受到一些损失，如在东北吉林个别地区，因为宣传时没有给群众讲清楚，有的误用了王铜治虫子（不知道王铜只能拌种防病用）有的认为种子消毒长出来的庄稼将来人与牲口都不能吃，结果把王铜埋起来不敢用。有的认为王铜可以治百病，使用它去医疮，再加上使用时的种种顾虑，发下去的农药很多没起作用，在察哈尔省阳高县南沙岭村农民杨诚用“可湿性六、六、六”喷果树时，因浓度过重，喷了二十棵，发生了药害。“赛力散”本来是拌种防病用的，在平原省误用它去治虫子，结果虫子和十余亩庄稼一齐治死了，另外还有些地区，随便把农药配合使用，结果喷了很多药剂，不见效力，形成了一种浪费，有些地区，当农药运到后，因为使用方法未弄清楚，也不敢向群众推广，只有把农药存放起来。
    根据今年使用药械的经验，在推广工作中必须注意几点：
    （一）向各地推广的药械，必须有技术人员，帮助农民解决技术问题，如河北省邯郸专区，今年推广药械时，各县都举办了短期训练，有一千多人，学会了药械的简单使用方法，当棉花虫害严重时，药械就充分发挥了作用，在北京郊区用药械防治菜虫时，在技术上因为有人直接帮助，就治了菜蚜三万余亩，特别是，在没有使用药械习惯地区，群众思想顾虑甚多，更应该宣传技术，并加强技术指导。
    （二）推广的农药，要力求简单，不要种类太多，因为过于复杂了，农民更无法掌握技术，如今年推广的农药，不下十余种，有的一个地区，同时即推广出去好几种，等到具体使用时，就无法鉴别。
    （三）为了避免损失与减少浪费，在农药使用以前，尽可能的要及时进行药效试验。凡认为没有把握的农药，决不能盲目推广，如今年在河北部分地区推广的“鱼藤粉”，由于存放过久，已减低药效，结果，杀虫效力差，群众反映不好。直接妨碍了此种农药今后的推广。
