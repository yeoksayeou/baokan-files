　　Fuel Industry Department Petroleum Management Bureau
    Employees Eagerly Join the Volunteer Army
    [From Our Own Correspondent] After studying the current situation, cadres of the Petroleum Management Bureau of the Central Fuel Industry Department have gained a deeper understanding of the nature of the US imperialist aggression. Experts, technicians, and management staff have all expressed their determination to resist America and aid Korea. Among the bureau's total of more than 120 employees, one-third have signed up to join the Volunteer Army, one-third are absolutely obedient to organizational transfers, and the rest are willing to redouble their efforts in their current positions, to improve petroleum production, and strengthen national defense. In the past, many staff members of the bureau harbored muddled ideas, fantasizing about carrying out peaceful construction without paying attention to the US imperialist aggression, and some even had pro-American and fear-of-America tendencies. After two weeks of study, and seeing the current facts of the US imperialists' frantic expansion of their war of aggression and their constant provocations against us, they recognized the true face of the US imperialists, and thus determined their own attitude -- resolutely resist America and aid Korea. The bureau has many experts and engineers who studied in the United States, and they have all actively expressed: Can loving the country be left to others? For example, Wen Kemen, Planning Department Engineer Li Tongzhao, Technical Department Deputy Engineer Wang Shuzhi, and other comrades have all signed up to join the Volunteer Army.

　　燃料工业部石油管理总局
    职工纷纷参加志愿军
    【本报讯】中央燃料工业部石油管理总局干部经过时事学习，对美帝进行的侵略战争的本质，已有了更进一步的认识。专家、技术人员、管理工作人员都纷纷表示了抗美援朝的决心。该局全体一百二十余人中，报名参加志愿军的占三分之一；绝对服从组织调动的占三分之一；其余的人都愿在现在的工作岗位上加倍努力工作，搞好石油生产，增强国防力量。过去，该局工作人员中，有不少人存有糊涂观念，幻想不理美帝侵略而进行和平建设，甚至有亲美、恐美的毛病。经过两周的学习，及见到目前美帝疯狂扩大侵略战争、不断向我挑衅的事实，认清了美帝的真面目，因此也就决定了自己的态度——坚决抗美援朝。该局有很多留美的专家、工程师，他们都积极表示：爱国绝不能后人？如温可门、计划处工程师李同照、技术处副工程师王树芝等同志均报名参加志愿军。
