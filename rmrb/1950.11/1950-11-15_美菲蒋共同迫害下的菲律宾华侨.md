Filipino Overseas Chinese Under the Joint Persecution of the US, Philippines, and Chiang Kai-shek
	Feiyan

	In recent months, the Philippine People's Liberation Army has launched a nationwide large-scale guerrilla war, which has greatly alarmed Quirino, the loyal running dog of US imperialism. The defeated Philippine puppet army is suspicious and creates rumors such as "Several hundred 'Chinese Communists' have landed in a certain place in the Philippines!" "Submarines of unknown nationality are transporting arms to aid the Philippine People's Liberation Army!" and other unfounded rumors. The purpose of the Philippine reactionaries in spreading these absurd lies is to cover up the incompetence of the Philippine puppet army to their master, the US imperialists, and to insist that the Philippine People's Liberation Army has foreign aid, in an attempt to win more powerful support from the US imperialists. On the other hand, it also creates a good opportunity for Philippine officials to engage in corruption, in order to achieve the purpose of extorting and persecuting good and honest overseas Chinese.

	At present, the 200,000 overseas Chinese residing in the Philippines are facing an unprecedentedly serious crisis under the further persecution of the Chiang Kai-shek, US, and Philippine reactionaries. Chen Chih-ping, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang's special envoy to the Philippines, and Philippine Kuomintang reactionary ringleaders such as Sy Yit Sheng and Ko Chun-chi, are even more rampant. They take the opportunity to persecute overseas Chinese who are unwilling to be subjected to the Kuomintang reactionary rule, and constantly submit blacklists to the Philippine reactionary government. Based on the false information fabricated by Kuomintang secret agents, the Philippine reactionary government secretly arrested twenty overseas Chinese on September 13 this year, including workers, clerks, teachers, and businessmen. They are all respected figures in the overseas Chinese community, simply because they usually take a non-participatory attitude towards the various shameless activities of Kuomintang party hacks, and some even consider themselves to be taking a middle-of-the-road stance; but they are all regarded as thorns in the side by Chiang Kai-shek's secret agents, so they fabricate some charges such as "So-and-so is a Soviet spy in the Philippines," "So-and-so is the leader of the Chinese Communists," "So-and-so is funding the People's Liberation Army," etc. After these twenty overseas Chinese were arrested, they were imprisoned in Camp Murphy and subjected to countless tortures and beatings by the Philippine military police, forcing them to confess their crimes, before allowing sixteen of them who were considered to have "lighter charges" to be temporarily released on bail with huge sums of money. Those with "serious charges" such as overseas Chinese businessman Hong Zhongcan are facing the danger of being sentenced and deported to Taiwan. The judge rejected the lawyer's request to bail Hong Zhongcan, on the grounds that the "security situation is not good" now. "Since the defendant is a communist leader, he is a threat to security and national security." Hong Zhongcan's arrest was completely without material evidence, but the Kuomintang reactionaries bought some scoundrels to be witnesses.

	Now the number of overseas Chinese on the blacklist is increasing day by day, and there are already thousands of people on the blacklists of the Philippine Immigration Bureau and the National Bureau of Investigation. Philippine detectives often go to overseas Chinese shops or residences to search through boxes and cabinets in the name of arresting "Chinese Communists" or searching for arms. In order to achieve their purpose of extortion, they use various methods to "plant" arms, "plant" opium, or forge receipts for donations to the Communist Party and put them in your home. There are several such searches in Manila every day, and the entire overseas Chinese community is made to feel insecure, panic-stricken, and full of an atmosphere of terror.

	Many overseas Chinese, unable to bear the unreasonable oppression of the Chiang Kai-shek, US, and Philippines, have been trying to return to their motherland, but the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang is unwilling to let overseas Chinese return freely, so they have come up with many tricks to prevent overseas Chinese from leaving the Philippines. Every overseas Chinese who wants to return to China must first obtain guarantees and certificates from six or seven reactionary agencies, and then be subject to strict scrutiny of the blacklist by the Immigration Bureau, and have dozens of fingerprints taken, and pay eight photos to get an exit permit; if the spelling of each person's name is slightly similar to the name on the blacklist, then you are out of luck, not only will the time for delaying departure be delayed, but you will also have to pay a fine of one thousand eight hundred pesos (Philippine currency, each peso is equivalent to about 9270 yuan RMB). Recently, the Philippine Immigration Bureau has new regulations, and the time for returning to China is usually limited to one or two weeks. After this period, the right to return to the Philippines is lost; if you want to stay in your hometown for a year and a half, you have to pay a huge price, at least one or two thousand pesos. Every overseas Chinese who wants to return to the Philippines also has to go through numerous difficulties. In addition to being strictly inspected by the Philippine reactionary government, they must also have a guarantee from a reactionary organization or agency before they can be released, otherwise they will be put in a water prison or deported. Chiang Kai-shek's secret agents have a large-scale conspiracy to persecute overseas Chinese. They sent secret agent running dogs Sy Yit Sheng and Lin Yingbin to the "National Bureau of Investigation" and the "Non-Philippine Activities Investigation Committee" to falsely accuse "90% of all overseas Chinese in the Philippines are communists, and 90% are helping the Philippine People's Liberation Army."

	Due to the rampant activities of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang in the Philippines, and due to the severe economic crisis of the Quirino regime itself, it is convenient for them to collude with each other and act as accomplices. In the past, overseas Chinese could remit money home without restriction. Since the Philippine government implemented foreign exchange control, each person is only allowed to remit 100 pesos per month, and they have to go through troublesome application procedures; now it is simply impossible. Kuomintang reactionaries control the private remittance bureaus and manipulate overseas remittances, and attempt to realize their vicious plan to cut off the overseas Chinese's support for the livelihood of their relatives in China. They use the post office to check letters. If the word "remittance" is found in the letter, they will be charged with "remitting funds to support the communist area" and extort and intimidate you.

	The Kuomintang reactionaries dare to oppress the overseas Chinese in the Philippines so unscrupulously because they rely entirely on the US imperialism and its running dog Quirino as their backing. Since the end of the Pacific War, the once-flourishing democratic movement of overseas Chinese in the Philippines has gradually suffered setbacks under the joint destruction of Chiang Kai-shek, the US, and the Philippines. Overseas Chinese democratic organizations have been forced to go underground one after another, and progressive newspapers and schools have been forced to close down. The leaders of the democratic movement have had to make a temporary retreat to avoid unnecessary sacrifices; however, the seeds they left behind, influenced by the victory of the Chinese people, are like receiving the rain and sunshine of spring, and are rapidly sprouting and growing. They do not show the slightest fear because of the enemy's strength and the reign of terror. The various democratic organizations of overseas Chinese in the Philippines have secretly jointly held a celebration of the anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, and sent a telegram to Chairman Mao to express their willingness to persist in the struggle under the call of the motherland and the leadership of Chairman Mao. The overseas Chinese in the Philippines have a glorious tradition of fighting side by side with the Philippine people in a three-year guerrilla war to eliminate Japanese fascists, and they have rich experience in long-term underground work. They have absolute confidence in eliminating the Philippine reactionaries.

### 美菲蒋共同迫害下的菲律宾华侨

　　美菲蒋共同迫害下的菲律宾华侨
　　飞燕
    近数月来，菲律宾人民解放军展开了全国规模广泛性的游击战争，这使美帝忠实的走狗季里诺大为恐慌，被打败的菲傀儡军疑神疑鬼，制造什么“华共”数百名登陆菲律宾某地呀！不明国籍的潜水艇运军火接济菲人民解放军呀！等等毫无事实根据的谣言。菲反动派放出这些无稽谎言，目的在于对其主子美帝掩饰菲傀儡军的无能，硬说菲人民解放军是有外援的，想用这来争取美帝更有力的支持；另一方面又为菲律宾官员造成一种贪污的良好机会，以达到敲榨和迫害良善侨胞的目的。
    目前旅居菲律宾的二十万侨胞，在蒋、美、菲反动派更进一步的迫害下，正遭遇着空前严重的危难局面。蒋匪帮驻菲的特务大使陈质平和菲律宾国民党反动头目施逸生、柯俊智之流，更加嚣张了。他们乘机来残害不愿受国民党反动统治的侨胞，不断地向菲反动政府提出一批一批的黑名单。根据国民党特务所制造的假情报，菲律宾反动政府又于今年九月十三日，秘密逮捕了二十个华侨，其中包括有工人、店员、教师和商人。他们都是侨界中颇有声望的人物，只是因为他们平时对国民党党棍的各种无耻活动采取不参与的态度，有的还是以中间路线自居的；但他们通通被蒋匪特当作眼中钉，所以就制造一些罪名如“某某是苏联驻菲的间谍”，“某某是华共的领袖”，“某某资助人民解放军”等加在他们身上。这二十位侨胞被捕后，即囚于莫飞兵营，遭受菲宪兵的无数次毒刑酷打，强迫他们认罪，这才允许其中十六位被认为“罪名”较轻的侨胞暂时以巨款保释，“罪名”严重的如侨商洪忠灿，正面临着判决遣送到台湾去的危险，法官拒绝律师保释洪忠灿的要求，理由为现在“治安情况不佳”。“被告既为共党领袖，则为对治安及国家安全的威胁。”洪忠灿的被捕完全没有物证，只是国民党反动派买通一些败类来作人证罢了。
    现在被列入黑名单的华侨一天天在增加，列入菲移民局和国家调查局的黑名单内者已有数千名。菲警探经常借逮捕“华共”或搜查军火为名，到华侨的商店或住宅任意翻箱倒箧的搜查。为了要达到他们敲榨与勒索的目的，他们就用各种方法来“栽赃”军火，“栽赃”鸦片，或伪造一些捐款给共产党的收据放在你的家里。在马尼拉市一天有数起这样的搜查，整个华侨社会被弄得人人自危，惶惶不可终日，充满着恐怖的气氛。
    许多侨胞，因不堪蒋、美、菲的无理压迫，纷纷想回到自已的祖国来，但是蒋匪帮却不愿意让侨胞自由的返国，因此他们想出许多花样阻难侨胞离开菲律宾。每一位想回国的侨胞，第一关就先要取得六七个反动机关的担保和证明，第二关就要受移民局严密的查对黑名单，还得盖了几十个手指模，缴了八张照片做出口证；假如每人姓名的拼音，稍与黑名单的名字相似的，那你就倒霉了，不仅要被留难延缓离境的时日，且得花一千八百的披索（菲币，每个披索约合人民币九二七○元）的罚款。最近菲移民局又有新规定，回国的通常只限一二星期的时间，在这期间过后，就失去了返菲的权利；要是你想在家乡逗留一年半载，则要付出巨大的代价，起码一二千披索。每一位要重返菲岛的侨胞，也是要经过重重难关，除受菲反动政府的严格检查外，还要有反动社团或机关的担保才能放行，否则就要坐水牢或遣送出境。蒋匪特有一个大规模迫害华侨的阴谋，他们派遣特务走狗施逸生和林应彬到“国家调查局”和“非菲活动调查委员会”去诬控“全菲华侨百分九十是共产党，百分之九十是帮助菲人民解放军的”。
    由于蒋匪帮在菲律宾的猖狂活动，由于季里诺政权自身存在严重的经济危机，便利它们互相勾结，狼狈为奸。以前华侨可以无限制的汇款回家，自从菲政府实行外汇统制后，每人每月只准汇一百披索，还要经过麻烦的申请手续；现在简直不行了，国民党反动派把持民信局操纵侨汇，并企图实现其断绝华侨对国内侨眷生活接济的毒计。它们利用邮局检查信件，如果信中被发现有汇款字样，则被加以“汇款接济共区”的罪名，向你勒索威吓一番。
    国民党反动派敢于如此肆无忌惮的压迫菲岛侨胞，是完全倚赖它有美帝及其走狗季里诺作靠山。自太平洋战争结束后，蓬勃一时的菲律宾华侨民主运动，在蒋、美、菲合力的摧残下，逐渐受了挫折，华侨民主团体相继被迫转入地下，进步的报馆和学校被迫停办。民主运动的领导者，为避免无谓的牺牲不得不作暂时的退却；可是他们落下的种子，因受中国人民胜利的影响，正象得到春天的雨水和阳光，正迅速在发芽滋长，他们并不因敌人的强大和恐怖统治而表现丝毫的畏惧。全菲华侨各民主团体曾秘密联合举行庆祝中华人民共和国诞生周年纪念，并通电向毛主席致敬，表示他们愿在祖国的感召与毛主席的领导下坚持斗争。菲律宾华侨有着三年游击战争与菲律宾人民并肩作战消灭日本法西斯的光荣的传统，有着长期地下工作的丰富经验，他们是有绝对的信心来消灭菲律宾反动派的。
