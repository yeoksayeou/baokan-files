Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 25th. In the course of carrying out the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea to protect our homes and defend the country, the Tianjin industrial and commercial circles have successively held symposiums to accuse U.S. imperialism of its economic aggression crimes of stifling China's national industry and commerce. At the meeting of the cigarette industry to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea to protect our homes and defend the country, Li Shuren of the New Minsheng Cigarette Factory said: "During the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, the market was flooded with American cigarettes. Most of the fifteen cigarette factories in the city were in a state of stagnation. The total output in the second half of 1948 was less than one month's output now. Therefore, the cigarette industry must take practical actions to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea to protect our homes and defend the country, and settle this account with U.S. imperialism." He proposed that anti-U.S. aggression and aid Korea slogans be affixed to the seal of each pack of cigarettes, which was endorsed by all his colleagues.

Wang Taizhen, manager of Zhongtian Electric Motor Factory, said: "During the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, American electrical equipment materials controlled the market in the form of 'surplus materials', causing Tianjin's electrical equipment industry to suffocate. At that time, Zhongtian Electric Motor Factory only produced 300 telephones per month. In the year since liberation, it has produced 5,000 units, and in the first ten months of this year, it has produced 8,000 units. This is a production record that we have not had in the nineteen years since the factory was built. Only by crushing the aggression of U.S. imperialism can we build up."

Zhu Lintang, chairman of the Milk Refining Industry Association, recalled the tragic situation before liberation when the dumping of American milk powder squeezed China's milk refining industry to the point of breathlessness. At that time, more than forty ranches in Tianjin had 2,200 dairy cows. Because the market was full of American milk powder, they were forced to slaughter the dairy cows for sale, and later only 800 remained. The joint operation of Tianjin Ranch Industry Milk Product Factory wanted to struggle, but as a result, it was overwhelmed by American goods and had to stop work. He said, "After liberation, we have a way to survive, and our colleagues are expanding equipment and purchasing new cattle. When we buy cattle, we remember the tragic situation when we slaughtered cattle. Who forced us to slaughter cattle? It is U.S. imperialism!"

Li Weiyi, director of the Leather Making Industry Association, said: "After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, hundreds of thousands of pounds of American leather were dumped in Tianjin. Our three or five factories reduced production by nine-tenths. The largest one only produced three or five hundred sheets per day, and it was impossible to survive. After liberation, our production capacity has recovered, and now we can produce 10,000 sheets of leather per month. The leather making industry is developing. We cannot allow U.S. imperialism to come and destroy it again."

The manager of Xingxing Paper Mill said: "Newspapers and magazines that came with the cultural aggression of U.S. imperialism even replaced our packaging paper with their old newspapers. High-grade paper was even more unable to compete with American goods. At that time, the chimneys of Tianjin paper mills did not emit smoke. Therefore, the biggest enemy of Chinese industrialists and businessmen is U.S. imperialism."

Li Wenqi, manager of the national sole photographic equipment manufacturing factory, Qixing Photographic Equipment Manufacturing Company, accused U.S. imperialism of openly "smuggling" film to squeeze out the factory. He said: "The Japanese invaders failed to stifle us, but the economic aggression of U.S. imperialism destroyed our achievements. Now we have been revived with the help of the People's Government. The development of our national industry and the security of the motherland are inseparable."

When pharmaceutical and new drug manufacturers recalled the pain of being hit by American goods, they unanimously expressed their determination to support the Korean people with practical actions and resist American aggression.

　　津工商界控诉美帝经济侵略
    美货倾销时扼杀了我民族工商业
    【新华社天津二十五日电】天津市工商业界在开展抗美援朝保家卫国运动中，各行业先后召开了座谈会，控诉美帝国主义扼杀我国民族工商业的经济侵略罪行。在卷烟业召开的抗美援朝保家卫国会上，新民生烟厂李树人说：“国民党反动统治时期，市场上充斥了美国香烟。全市十五家烟厂多半陷于停顿，一九四八年下半年总产量不及现在一个月的产量。所以卷烟业要以抗美援朝保家卫国的实际行动，和美帝国主义清算这一笔账。”他提议每包卷烟封口加贴抗美援朝保家卫国标语，全体同业都表示赞同。
    中天电机厂经理王汰甄说：“国民党反动统治时，美国的电工器材用‘剩余物资’方式掌握了市场。使天津市电工器材业陷于窒息状态。当时中天电机厂每月只产三百部电话机。解放一年来就生产了五千部，今年十个月已生产了八千部，这是我们建厂十九年没有过的生产纪录。只有粉碎美帝国主义的侵略，我们才能建设起来。”
    牛乳炼制工业公会主委朱吏堂追述了解放前美国奶粉的倾销挤得我国牛乳炼制喘不出气的惨状。那时天津四十余家牧场有二千二百头奶牛，因为市场充满了美国奶粉，迫得把奶牛杀来卖，后来只剩了八百头。联合经营天津牧场业奶品制造厂想作挣扎，结果被美国货压得赔累不堪，只好停工。他说：“解放以后，我们有了生路，同业都在扩充设备增购新牛。我们买牛时就想起了当初杀牛时的惨状。谁逼得我们杀了牛呢？就是美帝国主义！”
    制革工业公会主任委员李威仪说：“抗日战争胜利后，几十万斤的美国皮革倾销到天津来，我们三五家工厂减产十分之九，最大的一家每天只产三、百张，已经无法生存了。解放以后，我们生产能力恢复了，现在已经可以月产一万张皮革。制革工业正在发展。我们不能让美帝国主义再来破坏。”
    星星纸厂经理说：“随着美帝国主义文化侵略俱来的报纸杂志，连我们的包装用纸都让它们旧报纸代替了。高级纸张又更竞争不过美国货。那时天津造纸工厂烟突都不冒烟了。所以中国工商业家的最大仇敌就是美帝国主义。”
    全国唯一的摄影器材制造厂七星摄影器材制造公司经理李文琪控诉美帝国主义公开“走私”的胶卷挤垮该工厂的经过。他说：“日寇扼杀我们没有成功，但是美帝国主义的经济侵略却毁灭了我们的成果。现在我们在人民政府帮助下复活了，我们民族工业的发展和祖国安全是不可分的。”
    制药和新药两业厂商在回想到受美国商品打击的痛苦时，一致表示要以实际行动来支援朝鲜人民，反抗美国侵略。
