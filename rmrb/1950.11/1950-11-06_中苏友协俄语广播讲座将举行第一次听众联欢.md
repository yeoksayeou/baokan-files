The Russian language broadcast lecture, jointly organized by the Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association and the Beijing People's Broadcasting Station, has decided to hold its first listener gathering at the Soviet Foreign Cultural Association at 19 Nanheyan Street at 2:00 PM on Sunday, November 12th. In addition to exchanging experiences, the film "They Have a Motherland" will be shown. Registered listeners can participate with their registration certificate. However, due to the small venue and large number of people, there will still need to be restrictions on the number of registered listeners. Therefore, the ticket distribution method is as follows:

　　1. Registered collective study units must first count the number of people who wish to participate in the gathering and inform the Beijing People's Broadcasting Station by telephone (telephone numbers 36003 and 5773) on the 6th and 7th of this month. The station will rationally allocate tickets based on the number of people proposed by each unit and will announce the distribution details during the elementary class broadcast on the 8th, after which tickets can be collected.

　　2. Registered individual learners can go to the Beijing People's Broadcasting Station at 3 West Chang'an Avenue with their registration certificate to collect tickets from the 6th onwards. As the number of tickets is limited, they will be distributed until they are gone.

　　3. Those participating in collective study at cultural centers or reading rooms will be issued tickets uniformly by the respective cultural centers or reading rooms.

In addition, the broadcast Russian language lecture will continue to produce commemorative badges for the second group of listeners. The Beijing People's Broadcasting Station will collect reservation fees between the 6th and 11th of this month. The cost is 1,200 yuan per badge.

    北京市中苏友好协会和北京市人民广播电台合办的广播俄语讲座，决定在本月十二日（星期日）下午二时在南河沿十九号苏联对外文化协会举行第一次听众联欢会。会上除交流经验外，并放映《他们有祖国》电影。曾办理登记的听众，可凭登记证领票参加。但因场子小，人数多，已登记的听众，仍须有所限制。故规定发票办法如下：
    一、曾登记的集体学习单位，须先将愿参加联欢会的人数统计一下，在本月六、七两日，用电话告诉北京市人民广播电台（该台电话三局六○○三，五七七三）该台将根据各单位提出的人数，加以合理分配，于八日初级讲课时间广播通知，再来领票。
    二、曾登记的个别学习者，可自六日起凭登记证前往西长安街三号北京市人民广播电台领票。因数目不多，发完为止。
    三、参加各文化馆或书报阅览室集体学习的，由各文化馆或书报阅览室统一发给。
    此外广播俄语讲座继续为第二期听众制做纪念章，北京市人民广播电台在本月六日至十一日间收预定费。每个一千二百元。
