Xinhua News Agency, New York, November 3rd (TASS dispatch): The plenary session of the United Nations General Assembly on the afternoon of November 2 continued to debate the "United Action for Peace" proposal. The first speaker, Cuban representative Gutiérrez, attempted to prove the legality of the proposal put forward by the United States, Britain, France, and four other countries. The Cuban representative talked at length about the "paralysis" of the United Nations allegedly caused by the principle of unanimity among the great powers in the Security Council. He insisted that the adoption of the seven-nation proposal would rescue the organization from this "paralysis."

Soviet delegation head Vyshinsky spoke next.

Vyshinsky recounted that during the discussion of the seven-nation proposal in the Political Committee, the Soviet delegation had announced that it was prepared to support certain provisions contained in the proposal. Regarding other provisions, the Soviet delegation expressed opposition or proposed amendments to remove provisions that endangered the cause of peace and to make the proposal a genuine tool for strengthening peace and security for all nations. Vyshinsky said that the Soviet Union has always supported and will continue to support all measures aimed at maintaining peace, even if these measures are insufficient and incomplete. Vyshinsky continued, we are submitting our amendments to the General Assembly again, and we are convinced that if this proposal is adopted without including the Soviet amendments, it will not truly guarantee the strengthening of peace, but will become a source of great danger to peace.

In discussing the speeches of the representatives of the countries proposing the seven-nation proposal, Vyshinsky pointed out that the representatives of the proposing countries allowed themselves to engage in base slanderous attacks on the Soviet Union in a rude manner. Such attacks are incompatible with the task of strengthening cooperation among nations for the sake of peace. The Soviet representative pointed out that the more these proposers speak, the clearer it becomes that they are trying to use the words of intimidating cooperation to cover up their unwillingness to cooperate and their attempts to obstruct such cooperation.

Vyshinsky referred to Stalin's words. Stalin said in October 1948 that the instigators of the aggressive policies of the United States and Britain are not concerned with cooperation and agreement with the Soviet Union; they do not want to reach agreement and cooperation with the Soviet Union, but want to talk emptily about cooperation in order to use these empty talks to cover up their unwillingness to cooperate and to shift the responsibility for undermining cooperation onto the Soviet Union; the warmongers who are trying to launch a new world war are afraid of reaching agreement and cooperation with the Soviet Union, because such an agreement would deprive the aggressive policies of these countries of any target. Vyshinsky continued, the proposers of this proposal are trying to compete with each other in arrogance and rudeness in order to influence neurotic people with their thundering speeches.

Referring to the speech of the US representative Dulles, Vyshinsky said that this speech once again confirmed Dulles' reputation as a master liar and a warmonger. Vyshinsky recalled, when discussing Dulles' citation of the fascist Italian aggression against Abyssinia in 1935, that only the Soviet Union protested this aggression, and the fascist aggression was launched with the connivance of the governments of the United States, Britain, and France. The three governments made no attempt to prevent this aggression from happening.

The head of the Soviet delegation further recalled that no one did more than the United States in the matter of rearming the Hitler bandit aggressors, and one of the active American leaders who helped to bring about this rearmament was Dulles.

Vyshinsky exposed Dulles' slander that the Soviet Union concluded an agreement with Germany in 1939 to partition Poland. Vyshinsky pointed out that when the Soviet army marched to meet the Hitlerite robbers, it stopped these robbers near the so-called Curzon Line, thus establishing the Eastern Front, a powerful line of defense against Hitler's army. Vyshinsky continued, in fact, a non-aggression treaty was concluded with Germany, but this treaty played a significant and positive role in the struggle against the Hitlerite robbers, because it delayed the outbreak of the war by a year and a half, giving the Soviet Union time to strengthen its army, which later defeated the Hitlerite army.

Vyshinsky said that American policy is afraid of the truth. This explains why the representatives of the Anglo-American bloc violated the Charter and rejected the proposal to invite representatives of North Korea to participate in the discussion of the Korean issue in the United Nations bodies. This explains why the representatives of this bloc do not dare to mention the published documents exposing American aggression in Korea.

Vyshinsky explained in detail that the root of the disagreement between the great powers is not the so-called "veto" - the principle of unanimity of the five permanent members of the Security Council, as many supporters of the proposal under discussion say - but the basic line of American foreign policy. He pointed out that the current American foreign policy is based on the principles of force and dictatorship. Vyshinsky quoted Dulles' words in his book "War or Peace?", in which Dulles directly spoke of the need for the United States to exert pressure on the Marshallized countries of Europe. In conclusion, Vyshinsky asked the General Assembly to adopt the amendments proposed by the Soviet delegation and the proposals put forward by the Soviet delegation. The next speaker, the Argentine representative, declared that Argentina would abstain from voting on the entire seven-nation proposal and on the clause in the proposal that recommended that the troops allocated to the United Nations by the various countries should be controlled by the General Assembly. The Argentine representative said that his delegation had serious doubts about the legality of such a recommendation.

The representative of Yemen said that he would abstain from voting on the clause in the seven-nation proposal that recommended the establishment of a United Nations armed force, but he would vote in favor of the entire proposal.

Indian representative Rau said that he would abstain from voting on the entire seven-nation proposal and on those clauses that mentioned United Nations armed forces. Rau said that the Indian delegation believed that the time was not yet ripe to emphasize the military aspects of the United Nations, but that it was necessary to concentrate on improving the United Nations institutions that serve peaceful resolution.

Following the representative of Abyssinia, the head of the Ukrainian delegation, Baranovsky, criticized the seven-nation proposal and also the speeches of the supporters of this proposal. Baranovsky elaborated in detail on the content and significance of the amendments proposed by the Soviet delegation to the seven-nation proposal. In conclusion, he said that the delegation of the Ukrainian Republic supported these amendments and the two proposals put forward by the Soviet delegation. The meeting adjourned immediately after Baranovsky's speech.

　　维辛斯基在联大发言
    痛斥战争贩子杜勒斯
    指出美外交政策基于武力与独裁
    【新华社讯】塔斯社纽约三日电：联合国大会十一月二日下午的全体会议继续辩论“保障和平的联合行动”案。第一个发言的古巴代表葛提列兹企图证明美、英、法及其他四国提出的提案的合法性。古巴代表噜嗦地谈到据说是安理会中的大国一致原则造成联合国的“瘫痪状态”。他硬说，通过七国提案就会把这一组织从这样的“瘫痪状态”中拯救出来。
    苏联代表团团长维辛斯基继起发言。
    维辛斯基追述道，在政治委员会讨论七国提案时，苏联代表团曾宣布它准备支持这一提案中所包含的若干规定。关于其他规定，苏联代表团表示反对，或提出修正，以便由提案中除去危及和平事业的规定，并使提案成为加强各国和平与安全的真正的工具。维辛斯基说，苏联曾经并且仍将支持一切旨在维持和平的措施，即令这些措施是不够的和不完全的。维辛斯基继续说，我们再向大会提出我们的修正案，我们深信如果通过这一提案而不将苏联的修正案加在里面，那么它就不会真正保证和平的加强，而会成为对和平的巨大危险的来源。
    在详论七国提案提案国代表的演说时，维辛斯基指出，提案国的代表让自己以粗暴的方式对苏联进行卑鄙的诽谤的攻击。这种攻击与加强各国合作谋取和平的任务毫不相容。苏联代表指出，这些提案人发言愈多，事情就愈加清楚：他们力图用恫吓性的合作的字眼来掩饰他们不愿合作和企图阻挠这种合作。
    维辛斯基提到斯大林的话。斯大林在一九四八年十月间说，美国和英国的侵略政策的鼓动者并不关心与苏联合作和取得协议，他们不要与苏联取得协议和合作，而要空谈合作，以便用这些空谈来掩饰他们不愿合作并设法把破坏合作的责任推诿到苏联身上去；力图发动新的世界大战的战争煽动者害怕与苏联取得协议和合作，因为这种协议将使这些国家的侵略政策失去任何目标。维辛斯基继续说，这一提案的提案人企图在骄横与无礼上相竞赛，以便以他们大发雷霆的演说来影响有神经病的人。
    在谈到美国代表杜勒斯的演说时，维辛斯基说，这一演说再度证实杜勒斯作为说谎大家与战争贩子的名声。维辛斯基在论到杜勒斯引证一九三五年法西斯意大利对阿比西尼亚发动侵略一事时回忆说：只有苏联曾抗议这个侵略，而法西斯的侵略是在美英法三国政府的纵容下发动的。三国政府毫未设法使这一侵略得以避免。
    苏联代表团团长进一步回忆说，在重行把希特勒匪帮侵略者武装起来这件事上，没有人比美国做的更多的了，而助成此种重整军备的积极的美国领袖之一就是杜勒斯。
    维辛斯基揭穿杜勒斯所说苏联在一九三九年与德国缔结瓜分波兰的协定的谰言。维辛斯基指出，苏联陆军在进军迎战希特勒强盗时，在称为寇松线的附近把这些强盗阻止住，这样便建立了东部战线，一条抵抗希特勒军队的强大防线。维辛斯基继续说，事实上，互不侵犯条约是与德国缔结了的，但这个条约在对希特勒强盗的斗争中起了重大的积极作用，因为它使战争晚一年半爆发，给与苏联时间以加强其军队，这支军队后来击溃了希特勒的军队。
    维辛斯基说，美国的政策害怕真相。这就说明为什么美英集团代表违犯宪章而拒绝关于邀请北朝鲜代表在联合国机构参加讨论朝鲜问题的建议。这就说明为什么这个集团的代表们不敢提及已公布的揭穿美国在朝鲜的侵略的文件。
    维辛斯基详细解释说，大国间意见不同的根源并不是所谓“否决权”——如讨论中的提案的许多支持者所说的安理会五个常任理事国的一致原则，而是美国外交政策的基本路线。他指出：美国目前的外交政策是基于武力与独裁的原则。维辛斯基引述了杜勒斯在他所著的《战争乎？和平乎？》那本书里所讲的话，杜勒斯在该书里直接讲到美国有对欧洲的马歇尔化国家施用压力的必要。维辛斯基在结语中要求大会通过苏联代表团所提出的修正案以及苏联代表团所提出的提案。下一个发言的阿根廷代表宣称：阿根廷在整个的七国提案以及该提案中建议各国拨交联合国使用的军队应由大会支配的条款举行表决时将弃权。阿根廷代表称，他的代表团对于这种建议的合法性极感怀疑。
    也门代表称，在七国提案中关于建议成立联合国武装部队的条款举行表决时他将弃权，但他将投票赞成整个提案。
    印度代表劳氏称，在整个七国提案以及那些讲到联合国武装部队的条款举行表决时他将弃权。劳氏称，印度代表团认为强调联合国的军事方面，现在时机尚未成熟，但是集中力量改进为和平解决而服务的联合国机构却是必要的。
    继阿比西尼亚代表之后发言的乌克兰代表团团长巴拉诺夫斯基批评了七国提案，也批评了这一提案的支持者的演说。巴拉诺夫斯基详细阐述了苏联代表团对七国提案所提的修正案的内容与其重要意义。在结语时他说乌克兰共和国代表团支持苏联代表团所提出的这些修正案以及两个提案。巴拉诺夫斯基发言后遂即休会。
