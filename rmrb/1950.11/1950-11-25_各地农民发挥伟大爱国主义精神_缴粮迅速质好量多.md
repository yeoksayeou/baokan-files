    Farmers Across the Country Display Great Patriotism
    Grain Delivery is Swift, of Good Quality and Large Quantity
    [By Our Newspaper] In the movement to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes and defend our country, Chinese farmers have demonstrated great patriotism. Enthusiastically paying public grain is one manifestation of the farmers' practical patriotic actions.
    The most significant characteristic of this year's public grain payment in various regions is the universal attention to quality. Farmers call paying public grain paying patriotic grain. Wang Zhijian, an agricultural labor model residing in Sanhetun Village, Nehe County, Heilongjiang, divided the grain into three types when threshing. He kept the best three thousand catties to pay as public grain. Under his influence, Qi Chaoyu, a farmer in the village, mobilized his nephew to take out five *shi* of top-quality soybeans and exchange them with other households. After receiving the public grain and grass task in Dongtang District, Fengcheng County, Liaodong Province, the farmers of the entire district mobilized, some threshing and some picking grain. Qian Yugui, a farmer in Baimiao Village in the district, picked the best grass to pay as public grass. The public grain paid by the farmers of Nianzaogou Village, Zeyuan County, Chahar Province, was all first-class; they kept the broken and inferior grain for themselves. The farmers in the village generally fanned the public grain two to three times, leaving no grains or chaff. Before paying the grain, Shilibu Village, Tong County, Hebei Province, held a meeting where everyone discussed: Our country uses a lot of cotton, so we should pay more cotton. Le Qifeng proposed: I guarantee that our group will not only pay first but also deliver the best grain, ensuring it is dry, clean, and white. The farmers at the meeting unanimously agreed with her suggestion. Farmers in many other regions also proposed the slogan of paying good public grain.
    After farmers understood the great significance of paying public grain for strengthening national defense, many regions’ farmers were willing to use a little less themselves to pay more public grain. Dongzhuangkou Village, Jinghai County, Hebei Province, not only quickly completed the task of 28,000 catties but also exceeded it by more than 9,300 catties. Farmers in Shanmu Village, Guanyang County, Guangxi Province, said in a letter to Chairman Mao: We saw in the newspaper the news of American imperialism invading Korea and invading our country, and we are extremely angry. Now our village has not only completed the task of 62,500 catties of public grain in five days but also exceeded it by 2,500 catties. This is our expression of opposing American imperialist aggression.
    The fast payment of public grain is a characteristic of this year's autumn collection in many regions. A good harvest and a light and reasonable burden are important reasons. The farmers' patriotic zeal is an even more important reason. The emancipated farmers in Zhejiang said: "In the past, when the Kuomintang demanded grain, no one would send it despite beatings and scolding. Now it is sent quickly and well." Because they know that "paying public grain is to strengthen national power and no longer be enslaved by imperialism" and "paying public grain is for ourselves and for national construction." More than 50,000 catties of public grain in Yangcunqiao Administrative Village, Jiande County, Zhejiang Province, were all paid up in one day. Eight hours was all it took in Luxia Village, Xindeng County, to pay the public grain. Four hours were all it took in the First Village of Dongyang County. Houying Village, Guan County, Hebei Province, suffered a flood this year, and the harvest on six *qing* of land was reduced, but the entire village's 49,600-plus catties of public grain were all completed in just one day.
    During the autumn collection, individual regions have discovered sabotage activities such as bad elements spreading rumors. This has attracted the attention of local governments and farmers. For example, Liu Jingzhi of Sanjie, Liulihe, Liangxiang, Hebei, deliberately under-registered the output for the masses, which affected the smooth progress of the collection work. In order to prevent bandits and special agents from sabotaging, many regions have automatically organized armed forces to protect public grain. Each grain station in Wuxi County, Jiangsu Province, has established a militia grain protection organization, with 20 to 30 people at each station.

　　各地农民发挥伟大爱国主义精神
    缴粮迅速质好量多
    【本报讯】在抗美援朝保家卫国运动中，中国农民表现了伟大的爱国主义精神。踊跃缴纳公粮，是农民爱国实际行动表现之一。
    各地今年缴纳公粮的显著特点是，普遍注意了质量。农民们称缴公粮为缴爱国粮。住在黑龙江讷河县三合屯村的农业劳动模范王治俭，在打场时就把粮食分成了三种。他把顶好的留下了三千斤准备缴公粮。在他的影响下，该屯农民齐朝余动员他侄子拿出了五石顶好的黄豆，换给了其他户。辽东省凤城县东汤区农民当接到公粮公草任务后，全体都动员起来，有的打场，有的拣粮。该区白庙村农民钱玉贵挑了最好的草缴公草。察哈尔省泽源县碾槽沟村农民缴的公粮都是头等的，他们把碎的次等的留下来自己吃。该村农民普遍把公粮扇了两次到三次，一粒谷子、秕子都没有。河北省通县十里堡村在缴粮之前开了会，大家商量着：咱们国家用棉花多，咱们应当多缴棉花。乐起凤提出：我保证我们那组不但要先缴，还要交顶好的粮食，做到干、净、白。到会农民一致赞同她这个意见。其他各地很多地区农民，都提出了缴好公粮的口号。
    当农民了解到缴纳公粮对充实国防力量的伟大意义之后，不少地区农民宁愿自己少用一点，一定要多缴公粮。河北省静海县董庄窠村不但很快完成两万八千斤的任务，且超过了九千三百多斤。广西省灌阳县杉木村农民在致毛主席的信中说：我们在报上看到了美帝侵略朝鲜、侵略我国的消息，我们异常愤怒。现在我村不但在五天内完成了六万二千五百斤的公粮任务，而且超过了二千五百斤。这就算我们反对美帝侵略的表示。
    公粮缴得快是今年秋征中很多地区的特色。丰收、负担轻而合理是重要的原因。农民的爱国的热忱是更重要的原因。浙江的翻身农民说：“过去国民党要粮，打着骂着没人送，现在送的又快又好。”因为他知道“缴公粮是充实国家力量，不再受帝国主义的奴役”，“缴公粮是为了自己，是为了国家建设。”该省建德县杨村桥行政村五万多斤公粮，一天就全部缴清。新登县渌诸下村八个钟头就缴齐了公粮。东阳县第一村只用了四个钟头。河北省固安县后营村今年遭水灾，有六顷地减收，但全村四万九千六百余斤公粮，仅在一天内便扫数完成。
    在秋征中，个别地区曾发现了坏分子造谣破坏等活动。这已引起了当地政府及农民的注意。如河北良乡琉璃河三街刘静之故意给群众少登记产量等，影响征收工作的顺利进行。不少地区为了防止匪特破坏，自动组织武装保护公粮。江苏省无锡县各收粮站已建立起民兵护粮组织，每处均有二十人至三十人。
