[This newspaper's dispatch] According to the Shanghai Jiefang Daily: Amidst the surge of anger against the U.S. and aiding Korea, teachers and students from Shanghai Military Medical University voluntarily organized a fifty-five-member surgical team, which departed by train for the Korean front on the afternoon of the 18th. The team is led by Comrade Li Landing, a delegate to the National Model Workers Conference. Gu Chengquan, Acting Director of the Orthopedics Department of the university, and Zhang Zhong, Attending Physician of the Surgery Department, also participated. Before their departure, the university held a farewell meeting. At the meeting, Comrade Li Landing and Dr. Gu Chengquan both expressed their determination to learn from Dr. Bethune's great internationalism and spirit of caring for the wounded, and to defeat the U.S. imperialist aggression with practical actions. Dr. Kong Qingde, Director of Radiology and Physiotherapy, who attended the National Science Conference, and other representatives, also expressed in their farewell speeches that in addition to doing their own work well, they would also take over the work left behind by the comrades who joined the volunteer surgical team, and make all preparations as their backup force.
