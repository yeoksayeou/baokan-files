　　Sheffield is a famous industrial city in Yorkshire, central England, located at the intersection of the Leeds-Manchester-Sheffield and London-Newcastle-Edinburgh railways. The urban area covers approximately 53 square miles and has a population of over 500,000. Notable buildings include the City Hall, St. Peter and St. Paul's Cathedral, the Mappin Art Gallery, the Ruskin Museum, the Royal Hospital, and the University of Sheffield. The city boasts extensive markets, botanical gardens, and parks, with the scenic Beauchief Abbey located a few miles from the city center.

　　Sheffield is renowned for its steel products, producing a wide variety of firearms and tools such as axes, files, and saws. It also manufactures turbines, boilers, bullets, and various heavy castings. Silver plating is another important local industry. The method of combining copper and silver was invented in England as early as 1742-1743 by a local technician, Thomas Boulsover. The city's glass manufacturing industry is also well-developed.

　　In mid-August of this year, the Executive Bureau of the World Peace Council decided to hold the Second World Peace Congress from November 13th to 19th. The congress is scheduled to take place in the City Hall of Sheffield. This ancient city, famous for its steel manufacturing, is about to attract the attention of people around the world. As Harry Pollitt, General Secretary of the Communist Party of Great Britain, said: "What significance will it have if the historical declaration issued by the World Peace Congress once again comes from one of the world's largest munitions manufacturing cities - a British city? This will illustrate that there is another Britain that is different from the Britain of Attlee and Churchill."

　　二届世界和大的开会地设菲尔德
    汪昭才
    设菲尔德是英格兰中部约克州的著名工业城市，位于里子——曼彻斯德——设菲尔德和伦敦——纽卡斯尔——爱丁堡两条铁路的交接点。市区面积约五十三方英里，人口在五十万以上。著名的建筑物除市政大厦外，有圣彼得和圣保罗天主教堂、马平美术馆、纳斯钦博物馆、皇家医院、设菲尔德大学等。该市有广大的市场、植物园和公园，离市中心数英里的郊区，有风景优美的波契夫古迹。
    设菲尔德以钢铁器物驰名，出产各式各样的枪支和刀斧锉锯等用具；此外还有涡轮、汽锅、子弹及各种重铸造物。镀银也是当地的一种重要工业，铜与银铸合方法，在英国是早在一七四二——四三年，当地一个技工托马斯·布尔梭尔所发明的。该市玻璃制造业也很发达。
    今年八月中旬，世界和大常委会执行局决定于十一月十三——十九日召开第二届世界保卫和平大会预定大会在设菲尔德城的市政大厦举行。这座以钢铁制器闻名的古老的城市，即将引起世界人民的注目。正如英共总书记波立特所说：“如果世界和平大会再一次发出的历史性的宣言，是从世界最大的制造军火城市之一——一个英国的城市发出的，这将具有什么意义？这将说明：还有另外一个与艾德礼、邱吉尔的英国不相同的英国存在。”
