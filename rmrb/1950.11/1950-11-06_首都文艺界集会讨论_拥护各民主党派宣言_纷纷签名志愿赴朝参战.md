　　Capital Literary and Art Circles Gather to Discuss
    Supporting the Declaration of Democratic Parties
    Signing Up Voluntarily to Join the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea
    [Our Newspaper] Yesterday (the 5th), literary and art circles in Beijing gathered separately to enthusiastically discuss the joint declaration of the democratic parties. All literary and art workers resolved to contribute all their strength to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea to protect their homes and defend the country. Most people signed up on the spot, volunteering to join the war in Korea. The units participating in the meetings included the Beijing Federation of Literary and Art Circles, the Mass Literature and Art Creation and Research Association, the Beijing People's Art Theatre, the People's Fine Arts Studio, the Xinghai Choir, the Beijing Amateur Art School, and the cultural centers of Beijing. In a joint discussion, the Beijing Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Mass Literature and Art Creation and Research Association further discussed ways to expand propaganda. Feng Zi said, "If necessary, we can put down our pens and pick up our guns." Shen Pengnian suggested that efforts should be organized immediately to write a batch of short dramas similar to "Put Down Your Whip" from the early days of the War of Resistance Against Japan, and widely mobilize forces to carry out in-depth propaganda in streets, squares, and theaters. The discussion concluded with two decisions: 1. Support the joint declaration of the democratic parties; 2. Respond to the call of the National Federation of Literary and Art Circles and strive to create. During the discussion at the Beijing People's Art Theatre, with more than 300 people, Party members and members of the Communist Youth League took the lead in registering to go to Korea as volunteers. Non-Party and non-League members also stated that they had the same responsibility and obligation to participate in the struggle to defend their homes and the country. Older people also expressed their willingness to fight alongside young people. Deng Wansheng, a young opera singer, said, "If we don't defeat American imperialism, none of us will be at ease. As a mother, I love my children, and I want to be a model mother. For my children, I want to join the volunteer army." Du Ruihe said, "I am an overseas Chinese from Vietnam. I have witnessed how many overseas Chinese and Vietnamese people live a life of slavery without freedom under the oppression of French imperialism. In order to defeat American imperialism, I am willing to make a glorious dedication!" Wang He from the Fine Arts Factory and Wei Daoxian from the Creation Studio both requested to register to go to Korea as volunteers. All staff members of the People's Fine Arts Studio are willing to join the volunteer army. The studio has also produced twenty-seven anti-American and aid-Korea lantern slides, scheduled to be shown in rotation at Dongdan Square, Longfusi, the suburbs of the city, and various cultural centers starting on the 6th. All teachers and students of the Amateur Art School have requested that all courses be integrated with reality so that they can be applied to the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea to protect their homes and defend the country. Zhao Fucheng said, "To resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, I am willing to stop performing and carry stretchers!" All cadres of the Fourth Cultural Center, including Xue Bairong, firmly demanded to go to Korea to participate in the war. The Fifth Cultural Center is rushing to rehearse anti-American dramas and cross-talk such as "Two Kinds of Thoughts" and "The Atomic Bomb." During the discussion, members of the Xinghai Choir believed that they should take practical action now and devote themselves to the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea to protect their homes and defend the country.
