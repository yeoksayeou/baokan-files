　　People in Northeast China and other places wrote letters to Premier Zhou
    Supporting the denunciation and protest against US imperialism
    Demanding the United Nations to quickly take effective measures
    [Reported by this newspaper] Since Foreign Minister Zhou successively telegraphed the United Nations, protesting against US planes repeatedly violating our airspace and killing and injuring our peaceful residents, and requesting the Security Council to stop US imperialism from expanding its war of aggression, people from all over the country have written letters to Premier Zhou, expressing their firm support. A part of the incoming letters are now excerpted and published as follows:
    A worker from Fuxin City, Northeast China, named Li Wenrui, wrote to Premier Zhou saying: "We have seen various news about US imperialism invading Korea in the newspapers. I don't know how many Korean people have died under the guns of US imperialism." He asked Premier Zhou: "How can we help the Korean people resist US imperialism!"
    All the staff and workers of Dalian Russian Language School wrote in a letter: "Because US imperialist planes have repeatedly violated our country's airspace and committed crimes of killing and injuring our people, our Ministry of Foreign Affairs has repeatedly filed complaints to the United Nations. Until today, the United Nations, under the manipulation of US imperialism, has not given appropriate treatment to our country's solemn protest. The people of our country are watching the development of the incident with anger. If such bandit behavior of US imperialism, which is determined to undermine world peace and is determined to be an enemy of the people of our country, is not given appropriate punishment, it will not deeply realize the greatness of the power of the Chinese people." Cui Kuan and Wang Yonglian of the school, in a letter asking Foreign Minister Zhou to forward to UN Secretary-General Trygve Lie and all member states of the United Nations, listed all the provocative and aggressive acts of US imperialism since August, and wrote: "Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the Chinese people will surely make the invaders eat their own bitter fruit in front of us!" The letter also appealed to all member states: "The United Nations is an organization for maintaining peace and ensuring international security. We have the right to accuse you of the aggressive crimes of US imperialism and demand that it be effectively stopped." All representatives of the second session of the People's Congress of all circles in Chuandongnanchuan County wrote in a letter to Premier Zhou: "The brutal crimes of US imperialist planes repeatedly invading our country's airspace, destroying our peaceful cities, and killing and injuring our people are intolerable to the people of our country. We are determined to settle this blood debt with US imperialism! We, on behalf of the 320,000 people of Nanchuan County, support the Premier's accusation to the UN General Assembly against the atrocities of US imperialism, and we are determined to support the victory of our country's diplomacy with our lives." The letter from the celebration of National Day in the first district of Chao'an County, Guangdong Province, wrote: "We firmly oppose the conspiracy of US imperialism to invade Korea, invade China's territory Taiwan, and expand the war of aggression. We demand that US imperialist warships, planes, and troops immediately withdraw from Taiwan and Korea." The letter concluded powerfully: "We will resolutely unite as one, support your statement with practical actions, quickly drive US imperialism out of Taiwan, and support the Korean people's war of resistance against aggression, and fight to the end to defend world peace!" Xiao Jingxian, a farmer from Lujiaqiao, Kunshan County, Southern Jiangsu, wrote in a letter: "The strong neighbors of the United States, Britain, and France have violated the conventions, and now they are invading territories, interfering in internal affairs, and humiliating the weak Korean nation in the name of the United Nations, and taking advantage of the situation to suppress the restoration and construction of our People's Republic of China... They are hostile to the people of the world and intend to harm all countries in the East and the West, rob them of their autonomy, and make them colonial slaves forever." Therefore, he demanded to oppose US imperialist aggression and defend world peace.

    要求联合国赶速采取有效措施
    【本报讯】自周外长先后致电联合国，抗议美机多次侵犯我领空、杀伤我和平居民，并要求安理会制止美帝扩大侵略战争之后，各地人民纷纷写信给周总理，表示坚决拥护。今将来信之一部，摘要发表如下：
    东北阜新市一署名李文瑞的工友写信给周总理说：“我们从报纸上看到了美帝侵朝的各种消息。朝鲜人民不知道有多少人死在美帝的炮火下。”他要求周总理：“怎样帮助朝鲜人民抵抗美帝才好！”
    大连俄文专科学校全体职工，在信中写道：“由于美帝飞机一再侵犯我国领空，并制造了杀伤我国人民的罪行，我外交部已数次向联合国提起控诉，直到今天，联合国在美帝操纵之下，对我国严正的抗议仍未予以适当的处理。我全国人民正以愤怒的心情注视着事件的发展。对于美帝这种居心破坏世界和平、决意与我国人民为敌的强盗行为，倘不予以适当的惩处，它是不会深切地认识到中国人民力量的伟大的。”该校崔宽、王永琏在请周外长转联合国秘书长赖伊转联合国全体会员国的信中，列举了自八月以来美帝所有挑衅、侵略行为之后，写道：“中国人民在毛主席领导之下，一定可以使侵略者在我们面前自食其果！”信中并向全体会员国呼吁：“联合国是维护和平、保障国际安全的组织，我们有权向你们控诉美帝的侵略罪行，并要求有效地予以制止。”川东南川县第二届各界人民代表会议全体代表在致周总理的信中写道：“美帝飞机一再侵入我国领空，破坏我国和平城市，杀伤我国人民的残暴罪行，是我国人民所不能容忍的。我们坚决要向美帝清算这笔血债！我们谨代表南川县三十二万人民，拥护总理对美帝暴行向联大提出的控诉，并誓死为我国外交的胜利作声援。”广东潮安县第一区各界庆祝国庆大会的来信中写道：“我们坚决反对美帝侵略朝鲜、侵略中国领土台湾，和扩大侵略战争的阴谋，我们要求美帝的军舰、飞机、军队立即退出台湾及朝鲜。”来信最后有力地写道：“我们坚决团结一致，以实际行动拥护您的声明，赶快把美帝赶出台湾，并支援朝鲜人民的抵抗侵略战争，为保卫世界和平而斗争到底！”苏南昆山县陆家桥农民萧敬贤在信中写道：“美英法强邻等违背公约，今反借联合国名义，侵略领土，干涉内政，凌辱弱小朝鲜民族，并借势压制我中华人民共和复兴建国……敌对全世界人民，意图侵害东西各国，劫夺自主，永做其殖民奴隶。”因此，他要求反对美帝侵略，保卫世界和平。
