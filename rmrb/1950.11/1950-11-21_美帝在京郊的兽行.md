　　Bestial Acts of American Imperialism in the Suburbs of Beijing

　　As American imperialism frantically slaughters the Korean people, repeatedly bombs our Northeast people, occupies our territory of Taiwan, and attempts to follow the path of the Japanese devils, the peasants in the suburbs of Beijing recall the crimes of the American beast soldiers in the suburbs of Beijing and reopen the blood debts they owe. Every peasant grits their teeth and says: The time has come to settle the old accounts with these beasts!

　　In 1945, after Japan surrendered, American troops were stationed at Nanyuan Airport. Consequently, the area around the airport and the highway from Nanyuan to Beijing became one of the places where the robber army committed crimes. The people in the villages around the airport called the American soldiers "beasts" and "animals." When they heard that the beasts were coming from the airport to the villages, the peasants quickly hid, especially young women. The American cars sped along the highway, not even honking when they met people or carts. As a result, people were often run over and killed or injured. The cart drivers and rickshaw pullers were so scared that they dared not use the highway, hiding on the dirt roads instead. But these beasts still often ran over and killed people on the dirt roads. People said: Whenever I go on the road, my heart is in my throat, afraid of being run over!

　　In the winter of 1947, Liu Yuhai, Liu Yuhua, and nine other peasants from Xihongmen Village pooled their resources to transport firewood. When they reached the bridge north of Dahongmen, they had to use the highway because there was no dirt road. As they crossed, they discussed: Keep to the side, walk faster, and get back to the dirt road quickly to avoid being run over. But as the people in front passed, and Liu Yuhai and Liu Yuhua were walking on the bridge, an American car came speeding by. Liu Yuhai heard the rushing sound and looked back to see the car coming, so they quickly tried to dodge. But they didn't get out of the way in time. Liu Yuhai was crushed under the car, and his right leg bone was broken! Liu Yuhua's cart was crushed. He fell from the cart and died on the spot! The American car didn't even stop and drove away. At that time, everyone carried Liu Yuhua and Liu Yuhai and called the Yongdingmen police to report that an American car had run over someone. The police replied: If someone is run over and killed, bury them yourself; if someone is run over and injured, treat them yourself. We can't do anything about it! Later, Liu Yuhua recovered, but it took him a whole month to recuperate. Liu Yuhai's leg was broken, and he had no money to treat it. His cart-pulling partners lent him some corn, and it took him nine months to walk again. Now he is a crippled cripple. The borrowed corn was not paid back until last year. Liu Yuhai said: I have suffered a great deal since the year I treated my leg, with nothing to eat or wear. The American devils have made me suffer so much! The Communist Party came and truly saved us. Otherwise, I would not have survived!

　　In the same year, Wang Kun from Majuqiao was driving a cart and tried to avoid the highway by walking on the dirt road, but the American car still ran over his horse and killed it, crushed the cart, and injured half of Wang Kun's foot. According to people who have been driving carts for years in the cart union, too many people have been run over and killed on the road. Not only were ordinary people run over and killed, but also a Kuomintang air force sergeant.

　　The American devils used the excuse of hunting rabbits to shoot randomly outside the airport. Once, they shot and killed a worker who was working (from the city, name unknown). In October 1948, they almost shot Liu Zhen from Nanxiaojie. Liu Zhen said: It was so dangerous. I was working in the field, and they said they were hunting rabbits and aimed at me! Until the American devils were about to leave (i.e., on the eve of the liberation of Beijing), the American devils used carbines to damage the grapevines of the villagers in Nanxiaojie Village and the toilet of peasant Dong Liufa.

　　Nanxiaojie Village is at the south entrance of the airport, and American soldiers often went to the village to beat people and chase women. In November 1947, an American soldier went to Jing Yufa's liquor store to buy wine, holding a one-dollar American bill. Jing Yufa didn't know what kind of money it was and thought: I can't afford to offend him. I'll just give him a bottle of wine. But the American soldier refused and wanted to beat Jing Yufa. At this time, peasant Liu Fengxiang's wife also came to buy things and persuaded Jing Yufa. The American soldier saw her and chased her, not even wanting the money for the wine, chasing her all the way to her house. Liu Fengxiang's wife locked the door, and the American soldier kicked it for a long time without opening it before leaving. A few days later, an American soldier came to the street again and chased Zhou Qingxi's daughter when he saw her, scaring the girl to hide quickly.

　　These beasts used all kinds of methods to play tricks on the Chinese people. In June 1947, American soldiers brought a truckload of pesticide to Nanxiaojie. They said: We don't need it anymore, give it to the villagers, but they didn't give it to men or old people, only to young women. Some thought they really didn't want it, so they took basins to get it. The beasts used ladles to splash the people who were receiving it all over. Old woman Shen was hit on the head with a bucket and bled all over. The beasts laughed heartily. In November 1948, peasant Jin Yucheng went to Nanyuan and encountered a train carrying a carload of American soldiers. One of them was carrying a basket of persimmons and greeted him: "Hi!" As soon as Jin Yucheng turned his head, the American soldier hit him in the face with a persimmon, splattering his face. He quickly wiped it off with his hand, and the American soldier took a picture with a camera. The robbers laughed again. They took off the hats of pedestrians and threw them down from the car, letting the pedestrians grab and fight, while they laughed on the sidelines.

　　The beasts committed too many crimes in the suburbs of Beijing! The awakened peasants in the suburbs of Beijing have stood up. "The time has come to repay the blood debts to the American imperialist beasts!" The peasants are actively stepping up production, paying more public grain, and many have also signed up to join the volunteer army to support the Korean people. Everyone said: We must settle the blood debts with the American beasts!

### 美帝在京郊的兽行

　　美帝在京郊的兽行
    当美帝国主义疯狂地屠杀朝鲜人民并屡次轰炸我东北人民、占领我领土台湾，企图再走日本鬼子的道路的时候，京郊农民回忆起美国兽兵们在京郊的罪行，翻开了它们欠下的血债。农民个个咬牙切齿地说：是时候了，一定和畜牲们算一算老账！
    一九四五年，日本投降后，美国军队住扎在南苑机场。于是机场周围及在南苑通北京的公路上，便成为强盗军队行凶的场所之一。机场周围村庄的人们都称美军为“野兽”、“畜牲”；一听说野兽们出机场到村里来，农民都赶快藏起来，特别是青年妇女。美帝的汽车飞似的在公路上开动着，遇见人或大车连笛也不拉，因此，碾死碾伤人的事情时常发生；吓的赶车的或蹬三轮的都不敢走公路，躲在土马路上走。但这些畜牲们，却又在土马路上时常碾死人。人们都说：一到马路上，心就吊起来了，只怕给撞死！
    一九四七年冬天，西红门村农民刘玉海、刘玉花等十一人，合伙运劈柴。走到大红门北边的桥上，因为没有土马路，只有在公路上过一下。当过时大家就商量着：靠边走、走快点，过了桥就赶快躲到土马路上，免得被碾死。但前边的过去了，后边刘玉海、刘玉花正在桥上走，美国汽车就开过来了。刘玉海听见呼呼的响，回头一看汽车来了，两人就赶快躲。但仍没有躲得及，刘玉海被碾在汽车下，右腿骨头折了！刘玉花的大车碾碎了。他从车上摔下来当时就摔死了！美国汽车连停也没停就开走了。当时大家抬着刘玉花和刘玉海，给永定门警察打电话，报告美国汽车碾了人，得到警察的回答却是：碾死自己埋，碾伤自己治，我们管不了！后来，刘玉花缓过气来了，但整整养了一个多月。刘玉海碾折了腿，没钱治，赶车的伙伴们借给他点玉米，共养了九个月才能走路。现在成了拐腿残废。借的玉米，直到去年才还清。刘玉海说：我从治腿那一年起，可受了大罪，吃不上，穿不上，美国鬼子害的我真苦！共产党来了真救了我们，要不是可没活头啦。
    同年马驹桥的王昆，赶大车在土马路上躲着走，仍被美国汽车把马碾死了，把车碾碎了，王昆被碾伤了半块脚。据大车工会常年赶大车的人谈：在马路上碾死的人太多了，不仅碾死老百姓，还碾死过一个国民党的空军上士。
    美国鬼子借口打兔子，随意出机场打枪。一次打死了一个正在作工的工人（城里人，名字不详）。一九四八年十月间，又差点没有打死南小街刘珍。刘珍说：真危险，我正在地里作活，它们说打兔子哩，就对准我打！直到美国鬼子快滚蛋的时候（即北京解放前夕），美国鬼子用卡宾枪把南小街村老乡的葡萄架及农民董流法的厕所都打坏了。
    南小街村在机场南口，美国兵经常到该村打人、追妇女。一九四七年十一月，一个美国兵到荆玉发酒铺打酒，拿着一元美金。荆玉发不知道是什么钱，心里想：惹不起，钱不钱给它一瓶酒吧。美国兵却不答应，就要打荆玉发。这时农民柳凤祥老婆也来买东西，当场劝了荆玉发几句。美国兵看到她，就追，连酒钱都不要了，一直追到她家。柳凤祥老婆插上大门，美国兵踢了半天没踢开，才滚了蛋。隔了几天，一个美国兵又到街上，见到周庆喜的姑娘就追，吓的周姑娘赶急躲起来。
    这些野兽用尽了各种手段戏弄中国人。一九四七年六月，美国兵拉着一汽车治菜虫的药水到了南小街。它们说：不要了，给老乡们，但男的、老的都不给，只给青年妇女。有的认为它们真不要了，就拿盆子去接。野兽们便用瓢将接的人们泼的满身湿。申老太太并被桶打得满头流血。野兽们便哈哈大笑起来。一九四八年十一月，农民金玉成到南苑去，碰见火车上载着一车美国兵，其中有一人提一筐柿子，向他招呼：“嗨！”金玉成一回头，那美兵一柿子打在他脸上，溅了满脸。他急忙用手擦，那美国兵便用照像机照了像。强盗们又哈哈大笑起来。它们摘下了行人的帽子，从汽车上向下扔，让行人抢、打架，它们一旁大笑。
    野兽们在京郊的罪行太多了！觉悟了的京郊农民们已站了起来，“向美帝畜牲们清还血债的时候到了！”农民们正积极地加紧生产，多缴公粮，有很多还报名参加志愿部队去支援朝鲜人民。个个都表示：一定向美国野兽们清算血债！
