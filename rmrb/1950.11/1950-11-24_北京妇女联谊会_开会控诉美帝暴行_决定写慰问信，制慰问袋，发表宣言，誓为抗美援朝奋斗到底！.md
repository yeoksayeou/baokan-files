　　Beijing Women's Federation
    Holds Meeting to Accuse American Imperialist Atrocities
    Decides to Write Letters of Condolence, Make Condolence Bags, Issue Declaration, and Vow to Fight to the End in the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea!
    [Reported by this newspaper] The Beijing Women's Federation held a meeting on November 21st at the YWCA to resist US aggression and aid Korea and defend our homes and country. More than 300 members attended. Chairman Liu Qingyang called on housewives in her speech to take practical actions to resist US aggression and aid Korea. Then, attendees accused the US military of atrocities, and some signed up on the spot to join the Volunteer Army. Vice Chairman Li Jiansheng accused the American imperialists of killing her nephew in the Zhazidong prison of the Sino-American Cooperative Organization in Chongqing. She said, "He was arrested in November 1948. When the long night was over, at the last minute before dawn – November 27th, more than 300 revolutionary fighters with him were gathered in a room downstairs. Later, they heard the door locked outside, firewood was piled upstairs, and kerosene was poured down. This group of outstanding sons and daughters of China knew that their time to die for their beliefs had come. Everyone said: We are innocent, we will not wear these bloody prison clothes! So they all took off their prison clothes, held up their hands, sang the heroic Internationale, and shouted Long Live the Communist Party, and calmly faced their deaths! When I received the 'Bloody Record of the Chiang-American Special Agent's Massacre in Chongqing' and a martyr's family certificate this year, I did not shed tears. I will turn my tears into strength, step on the blood of revolutionary martyrs, and fight the imperialist war mongers to the end forever!" Gu Weiru said: "My fourth son was shot and killed by Chiang Kai-shek's special agents with an American gun at school. We must avenge this blood debt." Director Zhang Yingxia said: "I have already signed up to join the Volunteer Army at school. Because in Chongqing, I personally saw my cousin, who had only been married for ten days, abducted from the street and raped and killed by American soldiers. My neighbor's child was also trampled to death by American soldiers who picked him up to play with. These two incidents made me realize the brutality of the American imperialists, so I want to sign up to join the Volunteer Army!" Wang Shujin, the mother of six children, reported on her entire family's participation in the Volunteer Army. The sisters responded with warm applause and shouted: Learn from Aunt Wang! A total of fourteen people signed up to join the Volunteer Army one after another. The conference also discussed launching work such as writing comfort letters and making condolence bags. Lu Zhenwei of the Nancheng group stood up first to challenge: More than 50 sisters in the whole group will complete 300 condolence bags and 400 comfort letters within this week. Groups responded one after another, guaranteeing to complete the task. Finally, a declaration was passed, and it was unanimously expressed to resolutely respond to all the government's calls, strengthen learning, expand propaganda, save production, prepare to undertake logistical work, and fight to the end for resisting US aggression and aiding Korea and defending our homes and country! The declaration said: "Now, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, we are living a happy and joyful life. We enjoy equal rights for men and women, and we have obtained economic, cultural and various construction jobs. Such a motherland is something that women who have suffered thousands of years of feudal oppression could not have dreamed of. We love her, we cherish her, we want to contribute all our strength to defend our new China and repay our new China! We must give play to our past revolutionary will and fighting spirit, and vow to fight the American imperialists to the end, and never allow them to invade an inch of our land!"

    开会控诉美帝暴行
    决定写慰问信，制慰问袋，发表宣言，誓为抗美援朝奋斗到底！
    【本报讯】北京妇女联谊会于二十一日在女青年会举行了抗美援朝保家卫国大会，到会员三百多人。主席刘清扬在讲话中号召家庭妇女以实际行动来抗美援朝。接着，到会者控诉了美军暴行，并有的当场报名参加志愿军。副主席李健生控诉美帝在重庆中美合作所渣滓洞杀死了她的侄儿。她说：“他是在一九四八年十一月被捕。当熬完了漫长的黑夜，到达黎明前夕的最后一分钟——十一月二十七日，他们在一起的三百多名革命战士被集中到楼下一间屋子里。后来听见门外锁上了，楼上架起柴来，浇下煤油。这一群中华优秀的儿女们，知道他们杀身成仁的时候到了。大家说：我们是清白的身子，不穿这血腥的犯衣！于是一齐把犯衣脱下来，高举着手，唱着壮烈的国际歌，喊着共产党万岁，从容就义了！当我今年接到了《蒋美特务重庆大屠杀之血录》和一张烈士家属证明书时，我没有流眼泪，我要将眼泪变成力量，踏着革命先烈的鲜血，永远和帝国主义战争贩子斗争到底！”顾韦如说：“我的第四个儿子在学校被蒋匪特务用美国枪打死了。我们一定要讨还血债。”张英侠理事说：“我已经在学校报名参加志愿军了。因为在重庆的时候，我亲眼看见我表姊才结婚十天，就被美军从街上架走强奸杀死了。我邻居的孩子，也被美军提起脚来玩耍给踤死了。这两件事，使我认识到美帝的残暴，所以我要报名参加志愿军！”六个孩子的母亲王叔瑾报告了她全家参加志愿军的经过。姊妹们报以热烈的掌声，并喊着：向王大姐看齐！先后报名参加志愿军的共十四人。大会又讨论了发动写慰劳信、制慰问袋等工作。南城小组的陆振维首先站起来挑战：全组五十几个姊妹，要在本星期内完成三百个慰问袋、四百封慰劳信。各组纷纷响应，保证完成任务。最后通过宣言，并一致表示坚决响应政府的一切号召，加强学习，扩大宣传，节约生产，准备担任后勤工作，为抗美援朝保家卫国而奋斗到底！宣言中说：“现在，我们在毛主席和共产党的领导下，过着幸福快乐的日子，我们享受到男女平等的权利，我们得到经济的、文化的各种建设事业的工作岗位。对于这样的祖国，是我们受尽几千年封建压迫的妇女所梦想不到的。我们热爱她，我们珍视她，我们要贡献出我们全身的力量保卫我们的新中国，报答我们的新中国！我们要发挥过去的革命意志和斗争精神，誓与美帝斗争到底，决不允许它侵犯一寸土地！”（北京妇女联谊会宣教组）
