　　The Invincible Soviet Artillery
　　Soviet artillery is powerful and invincible. In the war to defeat German fascism, artillery was the main and powerful attacking force of the Soviet army. In the winter of 1941, in the battle near Moscow alone, Soviet artillery destroyed 1,500 German tanks. In the summer of 1942, during the fierce Battle of Stalingrad, artillery destroyed more than 1,600 German tanks, causing irreplaceable losses to the enemy's manpower and technical equipment, forcing the German army to switch from offense to defense. In the autumn of the same year, the Soviet army began to establish the Supreme Headquarters Reserve Artillery Regiments, and, following Stalin's instructions, adopted a new combat method - artillery offensive. In Kursk, Belgorod, Kharkov, Kiev, Leningrad, Minsk, Kishinev, and Iasi, artillery was the force that ensured victory over the German army. On November 19, 1942, when the Soviet army began its counter-offensive in Stalingrad, it used 4,000 cannons, firing 689,000 shells, destroying and leveling 100 German artillery companies and 60 mortar companies. The massive Soviet artillery guaranteed the infantry and tank units to destroy the entire depth of the enemy's defenses, and also guaranteed the subsequent encirclement and annihilation of more than 300,000 enemy troops, truly playing the role of "artillery is the god of war". In 1943, the famous "Katyusha" cannons destroyed more than 70,000 German tanks, and the anti-aircraft artillery teams shot down a total of 20,000 enemy aircraft during the four years of the war. Near the end of the war, Soviet artillery once again demonstrated its powerful and unparalleled power in the battles of Riga, Königsberg, Bucharest, Budapest, Prague, and Vienna. In the great battle to attack Berlin in April 1945, the Soviet army deployed 41,000 cannons and mortars, and the firepower density in this area was 610 cannons per kilometer, firing shells weighing 1.6 million poods (approximately 26,200 tons) at Berlin. In a small area of the front line alone, 22,000 cannons and mortars were put into battle. Never in history has there been such a concentrated artillery battle.
　　The strength of Soviet artillery is based on the powerful socialist industry. From 1930 to 1939 alone, the number of cannons built by the Soviet Union for national defense expanded nine times, and the individual cannons of special artillery increased tenfold. The quality of various cannons designed by Soviet designers and manufactured by Soviet factories was far superior to that of any country. The number of cannons produced during the Great Patriotic War was 29 times more than in Russia during World War I, and the number of mortars was 89 times more. During the three years after the war, 120,000 cannons of various calibers and 100,000 mortars were produced annually. In 1944 alone, more than 240 million shells of various types were produced. By 1945, Soviet artillery was five times larger than before the war.
　　Soviet artillery demonstrated a high degree of political awareness and excellent combat qualities in the Great Patriotic War. During the war, 1,677 officers and soldiers were awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union, and more than 1.2 million artillery personnel were awarded various Soviet medals and decorations. The designers and technicians of the munitions factories that continuously supplied the front lines with cannons and ammunition also received high praise. The invincible Soviet artillery is now guarding the security of the motherland and world peace. 【Xinhua News Agency】

　　无敌的苏联炮兵
    苏联炮兵是强大无敌的。在击败德国法西斯的战争中，炮兵是苏军主要的、强大的攻击力量。一九四一年冬季，仅在莫斯科近郊一役，苏联炮兵即摧毁了德军一千五百辆坦克。一九四二年夏季，斯大林格勒的激烈会战，炮兵又消灭了德军坦克一千六百余辆，并使敌人的有生力量和技术器材遭到无法补充的损失，迫使德军从进攻转入了防御。是年秋季，苏军开始建立大本营后备炮兵联队，并遵照斯大林的指示，采取了新的战斗方法——炮队进攻。在库尔斯克、比尔哥罗德、哈尔科夫、基辅、列宁格勒、明斯克、基希涅夫及雅西，炮兵是确保战胜德军的力量。一九四二年十一月十九日，苏军在斯大林格勒开始反攻时，使用了四千门大炮，射击了六十八万九千发炮弹，消灭和压平了德军一百个大炮连，六十个迫击炮连。大量的苏联炮兵给步兵和坦克部队保证了摧毁敌人防御之全纵深，也保证了以后对三十余万敌军的接踵而来的包围和歼灭，真正发挥了“炮兵是战争之神”的作用。一九四三年，著名的“喀秋莎”大炮击毁了德军七万余辆坦克，高射炮队在战争四年内总共击落敌机两万架。战争将近结束时期，苏联炮兵又在里加、哥尼斯堡、布加勒斯特、布达佩斯、布拉格、维也纳等战役中，发挥了强大无比的威力。一九四五年四月进攻柏林的大战役中，苏军出动了四万一千尊大炮和迫击炮，这一地区的火力密度为每公里六百一十尊大炮，向柏林发射的炮弹的重量达一百六十万普特（约合二万六千二百余吨）。仅在前线的一个小地带中，就有二万二千尊大炮和迫击炮投入战斗。在历史上，从未有过这样集中的炮战。
    苏联炮兵的强大，是以社会主义的强大工业为基础的。仅在一九三○至一九三九年，苏联建立国防的大炮的数量便扩大了九倍，特种炮兵的个别炮类增加了十倍，由苏联设计家创造和苏联工厂制出的各式大炮，其质量远优于任何国家。在卫国战争期间所生产的大炮，比第一次世界大战时的俄国多二十九倍，迫击炮多八十九倍。在战争后三年期间，每年出产了各种口径大炮达十二万尊，迫击炮十万尊。单是一九四四年内就出产了二亿四千万发以上的各种炮弹。到一九四五年，苏联炮兵已比战前多五倍。
    苏联炮兵在卫国战争中，表现了高度的政治性和优异的战斗品质，战争期间有一千六百七十七名官兵荣获了苏联英雄的称号，一百二十余万炮兵人员荣获苏联各种勋章和奖章。在后方不断供应前线以大炮和弹药的军火工厂的设计家、技术工人也受到了崇高的褒奖。无敌的苏联炮兵，现在正警卫着祖国的安全和世界和平。【新华社】
