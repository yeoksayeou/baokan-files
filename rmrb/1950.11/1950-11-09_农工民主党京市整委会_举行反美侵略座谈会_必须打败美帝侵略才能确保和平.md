　　The Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party Beijing Municipal Committee
Holds a Symposium on Anti-American Aggression
We Must Defeat American Imperialist Aggression to Ensure Peace
[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] The Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party held a current affairs symposium at 7 p.m. on October 31st. Over 50 Central Committee members and party members attended. Peng Zemin, chairman of the party, also attended and provided guidance. After Qiu Elun explained the significance of the symposium against the expansion of aggression by American imperialism, Chen Lu, He Shikun, Qiu Kehui, Ding Fangtuo, He Zhongmin, Fang Rongxin, Guo Zechen and others successively spoke enthusiastically, unanimously believing that: (1) The reason why American imperialism is frantically bellicose is the inevitable law of imperialism developing to its dying stage. Due to the serious internal economic crisis, American imperialism, with arms dealers and warmongers colluding, is becoming fascist, plundering world wealth and enslaving all mankind with money and arms; externally, the development of armed struggles by various oppressed nations has made American imperialism uneasy, attempting to suppress them in order to carry out its plan to enslave the people of the whole world, so it disregards everything and takes war risks. (2) This war of expanding aggression by American imperialism is a sharp struggle between the aggressive bloc headed by American imperialism and the camp of peace and democracy. From China's standpoint, our opposition to American aggression today is a continuation of the anti-imperialist struggle, one of the three major tasks of the Chinese people's revolutionary struggle. Painful historical lessons teach us that the most ferocious American imperialism is the greatest enemy of the Chinese people, and we must carry the struggle against American imperialism through to the end in order to ensure peace. (3) Now the flames of the war of expanding aggression against Korea by American imperialism have spread to our country's border, directly threatening our country's security, and we cannot ignore it. Our attitude is to maintain peace. If all peaceful means cannot maintain peace, then we are not afraid to resist the war of aggression. All our actions must be premised on being conducive to world peace, and the situation today has reached the point where we must take practical actions to maintain peace. We are willing to undertake the most arduous tasks in practical actions. (4) We have full confidence in the victory of the anti-American struggle. The just struggle has unlimited power and a broad foundation among the people, so it will inevitably win victory. The historical facts of the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation are sufficient to illustrate this. Today, all the Chinese people have been unified and united under the banner of Mao Zedong, so we have even more confidence in this. (5) As members of the democratic parties, in addition to having correct understanding and beliefs, we must work actively, carry out ideological mobilization, improve the understanding of the general public, and assist the government in stepping up the elimination of all bandits, special agents, and reactionary secret societies' rumors and sabotage activities. We must work harder to organize the strength of the people, unite under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, and defeat the aggression of American imperialism.

　　农工民主党京市整委会
    举行反美侵略座谈会
    必须打败美帝侵略才能确保和平
    【本报讯】中国农工民主党北京市整委会于十月三十一日下午七时举行时事座谈会，到中委和党员五十余人。该党彭泽民主席并出席指导。会上由丘锷仑说明座谈反对美帝扩大侵略的意义后，陈鲁、何世琨、丘克辉、丁方拓、何仲珉、方荣欣、郭则沉等相继踊跃发言，情绪激昂，一致认为：（一）美帝之所以疯狂好战，是帝国主义发展到垂死阶段的必然规律。美帝由于内部经济危机严重，军火商与好战分子合流走向法西斯化，以金元与军火掠夺世界财富，奴役全人类；外则由于各被压迫民族解放运动进行武装斗争的发展，使美帝坐卧不安，企图镇压以遂行其奴役全世界人民的计划，所以不顾一切作战争冒险。（二）这次美帝扩大侵略的战争，是以美帝为首的侵略集团与和平民主阵营尖锐的斗争。从中国的立场看，今天我们反美侵略正是中国人民进行革命斗争三大任务之一的反帝斗争的延续。惨痛的历史教训着我们，最凶恶的美帝是中国人民最大的敌人，我们必须把反美帝斗争进行到底，才能确保和平。（三）现在美帝扩大侵朝战争的火焰已燃烧到我国的边境，直接威胁我国的安全，我们不能置之不理。我们的态度是维护和平的，如果用一切和平方式不能维护和平时，则也不怕反抗侵略战争。我们的一切行动必须以有利于世界和平为前提，今天的情况已经到了必须以实际行动来维护和平的时候了。我们愿意在实际行动中担负最艰巨的任务。（四）我们对反美斗争的前途具有充分的胜利信心。正义的斗争，有无限的力量，有广大人民的基础，所以必然会获得胜利。抗日战争和解放战争的历史事实已足以说明。今天全中国人民已经统一团结在毛泽东旗帜下，因此我们更有这个信心。（五）作为民主党人，除自己应有正确认识的和信念外，必须积极工作，进行思想动员，提高一般人民的认识，并协助政府加紧肃清一切匪特和反动会门的造谣和破坏活动，要更努力组织人民的力量，团结在中国共产党领导之下，打垮美帝的侵略。
