　　Sheffield Today
    Haimengde
    The Second World Peace Congress is about to open in Sheffield's City Hall. The hall of this building will accommodate 2,500 delegates sent by 130 countries. In addition to this spacious hall, some houses have been prepared here as office addresses for various committees and technical services, as well as residences for some delegates and consultants.

    Sheffield has now established a special committee to prepare to welcome delegates from various countries to the conference. This committee is composed of more than 50 British celebrities, including: Vice-Dean of West Temple Donason, Pastor Leville Duf, painter Bertman, sculptor Gilibert Ledorard, composer Cyril Scott, Christian Darlington and Vivred Millers, writers Kebelde and Hamiliton, and scholar Harold Mores.

    We—the residents of Sheffield—have to regretfully decide that, due to the lack of suitable housing, some delegates have to live in nearby cities or rural areas. However, we believe that the delegates will be warmly welcomed in those places as well as in this city, because the hospitality of the British people towards peace advocates cannot of course be monopolized by Sheffield.

    We have no doubt that the representatives of the Second Congress will be greeted happily everywhere, whether in Barnsley—the largest coal mining center in Britain, whether in Rotherham—a neighboring steel-producing city, or in Chesterfield, a machinery manufacturing city in the North Derbyshire coal mining area.

    In this article, we feel that it is entirely appropriate to talk about what kind of city Sheffield is from an economic and political point of view. As we all know, our city is one of the centers of the British military industry, where high-quality special steel is manufactured for aircraft propeller materials.

    This is always emphasized by the British reactionary press whenever it tries its best to slander the peace movement and hinder the convening of the conference in Britain. For example, The Observer wrote bluntly with a provocative tone: "The conference site was chosen in Sheffield because it is a center for the production of heavy weapons."

    However, the point is not here at all. The British reactionary press always avoids mentioning such a primary point when talking about Sheffield, that is, this city has been a very famous center for the British working people's struggle for peace for decades.

    This is why the entirely legitimate resolution to support the Second Congress unanimously passed by the Sheffield District Committee of the Amalgamated Engineering Union is highly consistent with the excellent traditions of the 20,000 steelmaking technicians and machine-building workers in Sheffield and Rotherham cities who participate in the union.

    As early as 1917, when some small-scale anti-war strikes occurred in Britain, the workers in Sheffield were the pioneers of this movement. When William Gallacher visited various strike areas and wanted to combine the strikes in various places into a large-scale anti-war strike, the firm determination of the Sheffield workers made a particularly significant impression on him.

    The fighting spirit and class consciousness of the Sheffield workers were also reflected in the events that occurred on February 6, 1935. On that day, 30,000 unemployed workers, angered by the reduction of subsidies, held a large protest demonstration in front of the City Hall under the leadership of George Follettzer, one of the founders of the British Communist Party. The workers rushed towards the police force for more than three consecutive hours, determined to directly raise their demands to the city council members. The panicked Labor Party municipal authorities had to agree to restore the original amount of subsidies, even without the approval of the superior government. Two days later, Prime Minister Baldwin issued a statement that he "did not know at all" about the resolution passed in Sheffield. However, the anger of the people, which was so clearly demonstrated in the Sheffield demonstration, finally frightened him, and he ordered the restoration of the previous subsidy standard.

    During the Second World War, a grand occasion of friendship between peace-loving nations appeared in Sheffield: that is to say, on the Red Army Day in 1943, more than 30,000 people gathered on the streets of Sheffield. Dense lines of workers and soldiers marched through the streets; they all marched towards the City Hall (the venue for the Second Congress) to celebrate their Soviet allies.

    The working people of Sheffield, like all the people of Britain, still maintain their friendship with the Soviet Union, despite the suppression by the vicious reactionaries; we believe that the Second Congress will further consolidate this kind of friendship with the country that is recognized as a fortress of peace.

    Sheffield, as we said earlier, is the center of the British steelmaking industry and heavy machinery manufacturing industry. Under the situation of the insane arms race carried out according to the orders of American imperialism, all the factories in Sheffield are fully operational, and the workers' labor force is also utilized to the maximum extent. However, this is certainly not a manifestation of British economic prosperity, as the Labor Party newspapers are trying their best to describe. The fact that many buildings were destroyed by Hitler's air force bombs and have not yet been restored eloquently proves the falsity of the claim of economic prosperity. The commercial center of Sheffield still shows huge scars, which often reminds people of the value of the Labor Party's empty talk about the "revival plan" and the whereabouts of the "economic revival" carried out by the ruling group!

    The industrial products of Sheffield have undoubtedly gained world reputation. However, among all the most outstanding finished products created in our city, we are most proud of the "Sword of Stalingrad". The steelmaking and manufacturing of this sword were entrusted to some of the most experienced technicians! These people also felt honored to participate in the manufacture of this new weapon, because this weapon does not serve the cause of death and darkness, but the victory of life. The "Sword of Stalingrad" created in Sheffield and handed over to the heroic defenders of the Volga Fortress is symbolizing the friendship between the Soviet Union and the working people of Great Britain, and the consolidation of this friendship is promoting the overall struggle for peace.

    Now, the working people of Sheffield, with the same pride as during the melting of steel for the "Sword of Stalingrad", welcome the resolution to hold the Second World Peace Congress in their city.

    The working people of Sheffield fully understand that the British reactionaries are implementing the orders from across the ocean in a despicable and careful manner. They have mobilized all their strength, and if they cannot destroy the conference, they at least intend to increase the difficulties in the conference's progress. The fact that reactionary members of the House of Lords Vansittart openly declared that the government "should refuse to issue entry visas to the delegates" can be pointed out. Then Attlee ordered the closure of Britain's door to Rafael, Ehrenburg, Tikhonov and other members of the preparatory committee. In this way, Prime Minister Attlee clearly demonstrated the model of the bipartisan policy (Labor Party and Conservative Party) of pleasing Washington!

    The local Labor Party leaders in Sheffield are also trying their best to intimidate peace advocates and trying to prevent them from participating in the conference. Hobson, the secretary of the Labor Party's Sheffield branch, directly threatened that all party members participating in the conference would be subjected to the most severe suppression.

    As an answer to this kind of terrifying warning, we can cite the demonstrative speech of one of the veteran Labor Party fighters—Mrs. Mabel Smith (who had been a member of the Labor Party Executive Committee for many years). She once stated that "the claim that the Peace Congress is organized by the Communist Party is absurd." Mabel Smith expressed her will to support the Congress and participate in the preparations for the Congress. She warned: "They can expel me from the Labor Party for this, but I am not afraid of this either!"

    "We are not afraid either," thousands of working people in our city will say the same. They love freedom and democracy, and they yearn for peace. All of these have a long tradition; they have been tempered in the flames of class struggle.

    Therefore, the representatives of our working people and intellectuals are now saying to the delegates of the conference:

    "Welcome to Sheffield!"
    ——October 13th, Sheffield

　　今日的设菲尔德
    海蒙得
    第二届世界保卫和平大会，不久就要在设菲尔德的市政大厦揭幕了。这个大厦的大厅将容纳一百三十个国家所派遣的二千五百名代表。除了这个宽敞的大厅以外，这儿准备好一些房子，用作各种委员会和技术服务的办公地址以及若干代表和顾问们的寓所。
    设菲尔德现已设立一个专门委员会，准备欢迎参加大会的各国代表。这个委员会是由英国社会名流五十多人所组成的。其中有：西寺副主教多纳逊，牧师列维尔朵富，画家伯特曼，雕刻家吉利伯特·列多尔得，作曲家西里耳·斯考特，克里斯蒂安·达灵顿和维伏瑞得·米列尔斯，作家克别尔德和哈米里顿，学者哈罗里得·摩尔斯。
    我们——设菲尔德居民——不得不很抱歉地决定：由于缺少适当的房屋，有些代表只好住在附近的城市或农村。然而我们相信：代表们在那些地方，也同在这个城市一样，会受到殷勤的欢迎，因为英国对和平拥护者的款待，当然是不可能由设菲尔德包办的。
    我们毫不怀疑：二届和大的代表们到处都会受到愉快的接待，不论在巴林斯里——不列颠最大的煤矿中心，不论在罗特荷马——产钢的邻城，以及在北得彼什尔煤矿区的机器制造业的柴斯特菲德城。
    在本文中，我们觉得从经济与政治观点来谈一下设菲尔德是个什么样的城市，这是完全适宜的。众所周知，我们的城市是英国军事工业的重心之一，这里制造着用作飞机推进器材料的高等质量的特种钢。
    这一点是英国反动报刊，每逢尽力企图诽谤保卫和平运动并阻扰大会在英国召开的时候，总是予以强调的。例如，《观察家》报带着一种挑拨的口吻直率写道：“开会地选定设菲尔德，因为它是重武器的生产中心。”
    然而，要点全不在此。英国反动报刊每逢谈到设菲尔德总是避不提及这么首要的一点，即这个城市数十年来是全英劳动人民争取和平的斗争十分出名的中心。
    这就是为什么机器制造业联合工会设菲尔德区委会所一致通过的拥护二届和大这一项完全正当的决议，对于参加工会的设菲尔德和罗特荷马城两万个炼钢技术工人和机器制造工人的优秀传统显得十分适应的原由。
    早在一九一七年，当英国发生一些规模不大的反对战争的罢工的时候，设菲尔德的工人就是这个运动的先锋队。当维利雅玛·哈拉赫尔访问各个罢工区域，并想把各地的罢工结合成为反战大罢工的时候，设菲尔德工人的坚强决心，使他获得了异常重大的印象。
    设菲尔德工人的战斗精神与阶级觉悟，在一九三五年二月六日发生的事件中，也反映出来。那一天，三万因削减津贴而激怒的失业工人，在英国共产党创始人之一乔治·福列特泽领导之下，在市政大厦前面举行了抗议大示威。工人们连续三小时余向警察队冲去，坚决要向市政委员直接提出自己的要求。惊慌的工党市政当局——只得同意把津贴原额恢复，甚至不待上级政府批准。两天后，首相鲍尔温发表声明：他“丝毫不知道”在设菲尔德所通过的决议。然而，在设菲尔德示威中间表现得那么明白的人民群众的愤怒，终于使他害怕了，他便下令恢复了先前的津贴标准。
    第二次世界大战期间，在设菲尔德出现过爱好和平的各民族间的友谊的盛况：这就是说一九四三年红军节，当时有三万多人聚集在设菲尔德城的街道。街道上走过工人与士兵的密集队伍；他们全体向市政大厦走去（就是二届和大的开会地），庆贺自己的苏联盟军。
    设菲尔德的劳动人民同全英国人民一样，现在不顾凶恶的反动派的镇压，仍然保持着对苏联的友谊；我们相信，二届和大将使这一种对于公认为和平堡垒的国家的友谊更加巩固起来。
    设菲尔德，如我们在前面所说，是不列颠炼钢业与重机器制造业的中心。在依照美帝命令所进行的疯狂军备竞赛的情况之下，设菲尔德的一切工厂全部开着工，工人的劳动力也被利用到最大限度。但是，这当然完全不是英国经济繁荣的表现，如工党报刊上所竭力形容的那样。有不少的建筑物，被希特勒空军炸弹所破坏而至今尚未恢复，这事实就雄辩地证明了经济繁荣的说法的虚伪。设菲尔德的商业中心，目前仍然显示着巨大的创伤，这经常使人联想到工党人士关于“复兴计划”的空谈的价值如何，以及统治集团所进行的“经济复兴”的下落不明！
    设菲尔德的工业产品，不消说是获得了世界声誉的。但是，在我们本城所创造的一切最卓越的成品之中，我们最引以自豪的却是“斯大林格勒之剑”。这把剑的炼钢与制造都委托给一些最有经验的技师！这些人也觉着参加这一新武器的制造是荣幸的事，因为这个武器不是为死亡和黑暗的勾当服务，而是为生命的胜利服务。在设菲尔德造成而交给伏尔加堡垒的英勇保卫者们的“斯大林格勒之剑”正在象征着苏联与大不列颠劳动人民的友谊，这个友谊的巩固是促进总的争取和平的斗争的。
    现在，设菲尔德劳动人民带着正同“斯大林格勒之剑”熔钢时期一样的自豪，欢迎在他们本城举行第二届世界保卫和平大会的决议。
    设菲尔德劳动人民十分明白：英国反动派正在卑鄙地小心翼翼地实行着海洋彼岸的命令。他们动员了自己的全部力量，如果破坏不了大会，至少也打算增加大会进行的困难。可以指出的事实是：上院的反动派议员万西塔特公开宣称：政府“应该拒绝发给代表们入境签证”接着艾德礼下令关上英国的大门不让拉斐德、爱伦堡、吉洪诺夫及其他筹备委员会委员进来。就是这样，艾德礼首相明确地表示出了向华盛顿讨好的两党政策（工党与保守党）的模范！
    设菲尔德当地的工党领导者们也是尽力企图恐吓和平拥护者，企图阻止他们参加大会。工党设菲尔德分会书记霍布逊曾直截了当地威吓说：参加大会的一切党员，都将受到最严厉的镇压。
    对于这种恐怖警告的回答，我们可以引工党老战士之一——玛贝尔，斯密特夫人，（以前曾任工党执行委员会委员数年）的示威的发言作例。她曾经声明：那“一种认为保卫和平大会是共产党员所组织的说法是荒诞无稽的。”玛贝尔·斯密特表明了拥护和大并参加和大准备工作的意志。她警告说：“他们可以因此开除我的工党党籍，但是这我也不怕！”
    “我们也不怕，”，我们本城数以千计的劳动人民也会这么说，他们爱自由和民主，他们向往和平，这都具有悠久的传统；他们在阶级斗争的火焰中是经过了锻炼的。
    因此，我们的劳动人民与知识分子的代表，现在向大会的代表们说：
    “欢迎你们到设菲尔德来！”
