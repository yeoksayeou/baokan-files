Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 10th.

Those who went to the station to welcome them included: Soviet Peace Committee Vice-Chairmen Korneychuk and Yershova, famous writer Simonov, Russian Federal Deputy Minister of Education Dubrovina, and Director of the Far East Department of the Soviet Foreign Cultural Association Yerofeyev, among others.

　　Korneychuk, on behalf of the All-Soviet Peace Committee, delivered a welcome speech, stating: The Soviet people value the heroic struggle of the Chinese people under the leadership of Mao Zedong and their great contribution to the cause of peace. He emphasized: The Soviet people believe that the attempts of American and British imperialists to undermine the Second World Peace Congress will enrage all honest people around the world and will only make the forces of peace more united and stronger.

　　Guo Moruo, head of the Chinese delegation, said in his reply: Now the American imperialists have already launched a war of aggression in the East, invading our neighboring country of Korea, invading our territory of Taiwan, and openly suppressing the liberation movement of oppressed nations in Southeast Asia striving for independence and freedom. American imperialism has destroyed peace in Asia, and the Chinese people and all progressive people in Asia can never tolerate this action. In order to defend peace, we must oppose American aggression. This is the common will of the people of China and the common will of all progressive humanity in Asia. Guo Moruo continued: The gift we bring to the great October Revolution Day is the firm will of the entire Chinese people to defend world peace and oppose American aggression. In the common struggle to strive for lasting world peace and oppose wars of aggression, the Chinese people will unite even more closely with the great Soviet people than before.
