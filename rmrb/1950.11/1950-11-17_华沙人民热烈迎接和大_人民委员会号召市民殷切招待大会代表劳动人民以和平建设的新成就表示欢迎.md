　　Warsaw People Warmly Welcome the World Peace Congress
    People's Committee Calls on Citizens to Cordially Host Delegates; Working People Express Welcome with New Achievements in Peaceful Construction
    [Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 16th] TASS, Moscow, reported: On the 15th, "Pravda" published a report from its Warsaw correspondent, Makarenko, on Warsaw's preparations for the Second World Peace Congress, stating: Delegates to the Congress are arriving in Warsaw from all over the world. The working people of Warsaw have organized a demonstration to welcome them. At the rally, the delegates warmly thanked the Polish government and the Polish people for their hospitality.
    The venue of the Congress has been properly arranged. It was originally a publishing house: "Polish Language Building." High flagpoles erected in front of the venue fly the flags of all countries around the world. A huge azure flag embroidered with white doves of peace hangs from the roof.
    "Izvestia" reporter Yasovoy reported that the Polish people are welcoming the delegates to the Congress with new achievements in their peaceful construction labor. Warsaw workers have written reports on the implementation of their socialist production guarantees to celebrate the Second World Peace Congress on the colored banners on the scaffolding of various construction projects and on the walls of factory manufacturing plants.
    [Xinhua News Agency, 16th] TASS, Warsaw, 14th: The Presidium of the Warsaw People's Committee has issued a letter to the citizens of Warsaw regarding the Second World Peace Congress, which will open in Warsaw on the 16th, stating: The pioneers representing people who desire peace are coming to Warsaw. They cannot hold the meeting in Sheffield, England, as originally planned, because the British government, acting on the orders of American imperialism, is preventing delegates from attending the conference from entering Britain, attempting to sabotage the conference.
    Warsaw feels deeply gratified and proud that the Second World Peace Congress will be held here, and that the free voice of the Congress will resonate from Warsaw throughout the world.
    The Presidium of the Warsaw People's Committee calls on all citizens of the Polish capital to express due welcome to the Congress, to express love to the delegates, and to extend them cordial hospitality.

　　华沙人民热烈迎接和大
    人民委员会号召市民殷切招待大会代表劳动人民以和平建设的新成就表示欢迎
    【新华社十六日讯】塔斯社莫斯科讯：十五日真理报发表该报驻华沙记者马卡伦科关于华沙筹备第二届世界保卫和平大会的工作情况的报道称：大会代表们正从世界各处来到华沙。华沙劳动人民已组织了一次示威游行欢迎他们。代表们在集会上热忱感谢了波兰政府和波兰人民的招待。
    大会会场已布置妥贴。它原来是一座出版机关：“波兰语大厦”。竖立在会场前的高高的旗杆上，全世界各国的国旗迎风飘扬。屋顶上悬着绣有白色和平鸽的巨幅蔚蓝色旗帜。
    消息报记者雅索沃伊报道称：波兰人民以他们和平建设劳动中的新成就来欢迎大会代表。华沙工人在各工程建筑的架子和各工厂制造厂墙上的彩色长旗上，写上了他们为庆祝第二届世界和大而作的社会主义生产保证的执行报告。
    【新华社十六日讯】塔斯社华沙十四日讯：华沙人民委员会主席团顷就即将于十六日在华沙开幕的第二届世界保卫和平大会发表告华沙市民书称：代表着期望和平的人民的先锋们正纷纷到华沙来。他们不能在预定召开会议的英国设菲尔德开会，因为英国府举行美帝国主义青年的命令，阻止参加大会的代表们进入英国，企图借此破坏大会。
    华沙深感欣愉和骄傲，因为第二届世界保卫和平大会将在此间举行，并且大会的自由呼声将自华沙响彻全世界。
    华沙人民委员会主席团号召波兰首都全体市民对大会表示应有的欢迎，向大会代表表示热爱并予以殷切的招待。
