　　A Technician's Understanding of the United States Before and After
    ——An Interview with Qian Baogong, a Chemical Engineer from the Northeast Chemical Industry Administration Who Studied in the US
    Wang Ping

    After Japan surrendered, the Kuomintang reactionary government seized the fruits of the people's victory, frantically "plundered" and vigorously undermined democracy, actively deploying an anti-people civil war. This made Qian Baogong, a graduate of Wuhan University, unable to concentrate on scientific research, and he felt a sense of "smog, the world is vast, where is the kingdom of scientific research?" At this time, the United States' "condemnation" of the Kuomintang reactionary government constantly entered Qian Baogong's ears, like drinking cold water on a hot day; on the eve of Christmas, "Special Envoy" Marshall came, and the people in the Chiang-controlled areas who had been waiting for peace for a long time called him "Santa Claus"; "Special Envoy Ma" issued a "fair" statement on the US policy towards China upon landing. Qian Baogong thought: China has hope, and I personally have a way out – when else to escape the fascist Kuomintang rule to go to the "democracy and science" of the United States? He benefited from the Lend-Lease Act and obtained the qualifications for publicly funded study in the United States.

    He and a large group of young people going to the United States excitedly stepped into the American Consulate in Shanghai – in their hearts, this was an oasis in the desert, but the "oasis" did not bring a spring breeze but a cold current.
    --What? The procedures for applying for a visa to the United States are so troublesome? The forms to be filled out are half an inch thick! After filling it out, you have to put a fingerprint on it (a seal is not enough! What a great insult!). One of the regulations stated: those without US$2,000 in bank deposits were not allowed to go to the United States.

    What kind of "democracy" is this?

    When they boarded the seemingly luxurious but chaotic third-class American liner, the American-style "democracy" became even clearer: the third-class cabin, which accommodated 500 people, was as crowded as a sardine can, and the smoke, dust, and sweat in the cabin were as suffocating as in the Kuomintang reactionary-controlled areas; while the first-class cabin, which accommodated 50 people, was high above, brightly lit, and jazz music floated in the blue sea and clear sky. Qian Baogong and his fellow students were bored and started to calculate the shipowner's accounts: the income from the third-class cabin was several times greater than that of the first-class cabin; the many people in the third-class cabin supported the shipowner and subsidized the extravagant life of the few dignitaries in the first-class cabin.

    This may not represent the United States – let’s wait until we get to the United States to make a judgement...

    They saw the skyscrapers piercing the clouds and couldn't help but admire "that is truly a high degree of civilization!" However, a Chinese idiom had concrete meaning here – visible but unattainable! Many Chinese were taken by American police to small islands specially for imprisoning Chinese people because of "incomplete procedures"; some were hungry for a long time and could not go ashore; some even committed suicide in the pain of being subjected to all kinds of difficulties; even those who were lucky enough to go ashore, with only "US$2,000 in savings," were not qualified to enter skyscrapers!

    The shape of New York City is like a long worm, the small tip of its mouth is Wall Street, which is famous all over the world and hated by the world; a large section of the tail is the poor and dirty black area that still uses old kerosene lamps (when he first arrived in the United States, someone told him that New York had kerosene lamps, and he simply didn't believe it); the vast majority of Chinese people are only qualified to live next to black people, and Qian Baogong was naturally no exception. He said: "That's a good opportunity for me to understand American 'democracy and civilization.'"

    Qian Baogong went to the United States to study science, so he entrusted his American friends in China to introduce him to famous chemical companies for internships. "DuPont Company" replied: there were no vacancies and refused to accept him; he also ran into walls elsewhere. Because any private enterprise has its "business secrets" and does not easily accept outsiders. He had to intern at the smaller "Reinhold Bakelite Factory." The first sentence the manager said to him was: "Internship is possible, but there are two conditions: first, no questions are allowed; second, no note-taking is allowed!" Even with an omnipotent brain, there is no way to memorize thousands of machines and their activities. Those American engineers never revealed any of the knowledge they possessed to outsiders; they talked about the weather and dancing; they would never talk about machines or science. However, the straightforward American workers, after becoming familiar with them, would sometimes secretly reveal the secrets of the machines they managed.

    In 1948, a national science conference in the United States was held in New York. Qian Baogong heard that the conference would be followed by visits to major factories in New York, so he tried to participate in the conference. As a result, all the factories closed their doors to scientists; only the New York City Health Bureau's factories welcomed scientists to visit – it turned out that these were factories that dug ditches and delivered manure, and whoever wanted to visit could go.

    What science can be learned from this? Some people advocated adopting the "stealing skills" method like learning a craft in old China, but Qian Baogong knew that learning science requires learning a series of theories and methods; piecemeal "stealing learning" would not have good results. After much consideration, he knew that continuing to "intern" in this factory, the greatest prospect was to become a "sales engineer" – in fact, just a salesman for the factory's goods.

    He decided to transfer to the Polytechnic Institute of New York. At this time, the domestic situation improved, and the People's Liberation Army's counter-offensive continued to be victorious. Like most Chinese students who loved their motherland, Qian Baogong participated in various progressive activities, and everyone was talking about the new situation in the motherland. One day, an American classmate (later learned that he was a member of the American Communist Party) told him with concern: "It is best not to talk about Chinese affairs in coffee shops, American secret agents are more numerous and more hateful than Chiang Kai-shek's secret agents!" Once, Chinese students held a meeting in a certain venue of the International Building, and Chiang Kai-shek's secret agents, with the support of American secret agents, went to disrupt it, and their methods were extremely despicable and dirty – they defecated on the sofas in the meeting place; or secretly hid iron needles in the sofas. Later, at a symposium held by an American classmate, Qian Baogong learned that the historical foundation of American fascism was deeper than that of Germany (the typical fascist group, the Ku Klux Klan, was established earlier than the Nazi Party), and later accepted the experience of German fascism, so the steps and methods of American fascism were even more vicious. Soon, the deputy director of the chemistry department of the Polytechnic Institute where he was located was also reported by the "Un-American Activities Committee," and he couldn't help but feel chills for American "democracy."

    The true face of "democracy" was completely exposed; science and gold were once again turned into "treasures" in the bloody hands of big capitalists; the suffocating Chiang bandit regime was collapsing on the land of the motherland. He decided to return to the country to participate in the epoch-making great changes.

    On the third day of the liberation of Shanghai, they boarded the American liner and headed east. It was really interesting, sitting in the same suffering third-class cabin, they were submissive when they went to the United States; this time, they returned to their country but saw things they did not like everywhere, and they argued and quarreled with the shipowner whenever they had the opportunity. When the ship arrived at Wusongkou, they were eager to go ashore, but the shipowner said: "The Shanghai Communist authorities neither allow people to come to the ship to complete the formalities nor allow you to take small boats ashore to complete the formalities. We have to go back to Hong Kong." They did not believe that such a strange thing could happen, so they jointly sent a telegram to Mayor Chen Yi to inquire. However, the American ship went straight to Hong Kong. When it was about to arrive in Hong Kong, the shipowner handed them Mayor Chen's reply, which clearly stated: "You do not need any formalities to go ashore." They felt that they had been tricked and provoked by American swindlers in the end, and they were very angry, so they argued with the shipowner. The American swindler put on a "generous" face and said: "We won't charge you for the fare from Wusongkou to Hong Kong, isn't this a great benefit to you?" But in fact, the shipowner should compensate them for the loss of this unjust journey, because they were not going to Hong Kong at all.

    After arriving in Hong Kong, they learned that the ship was ordered by Washington not to enter Shanghai, in order to show US imperialism's support for the Chiang bandits' illegal "blockade of Shanghai" at that time.

    Qian Baogong quickly arrived in the Northeast. The prospects for the construction of the motherland were presented before him. The research office of the Chemical Industry Administration of the Northeast Industrial Department where he worked moved from a small room to a T-shaped foreign-style house; the original research office became today's employee cafeteria. He believes that in a few years, this research office will be further expanded and more like a research office, and will continuously supply various successfully researched chemical products from the research office. Even now, this research office, in less than a year, thanks to the efforts of all comrades, while working on the arduous task of building the research office, they are also engaged in research, and now they have successfully researched the manufacture of sulfonated coal. This is a major contribution to the chemical industry in the Northeast, because ordinary water quality is very "hard," and using this water to burn boilers greatly shortens the life of the boilers. To turn "hard water" into "soft water," sulfonated coal is indispensable. Moreover, sulfonated coal can remove the alkaline taste of seawater, so Qian Baogong said: "In the future, when liberating Taiwan, the People's Liberation Army can carry a bag of sulfonated coal across the sea, so they won't be afraid of not having water to drink."

    Based on his three experiences – the Kuomintang reactionary rule period, the period of studying in the United States, and today's New Democratic society – he deeply felt that: only in a country where the people are in power; only by using the power of the state to develop science in a planned and step-by-step manner; only with the research methods advocated by Marxism-Leninism that combine theory and practice, can science be truly developed; scientific workers can have a brilliant future and a happy life.

    When the great swindler Marshall took office as Secretary of Defense at the critical moment when US imperialism launched the war of aggression against Korea, and then further expanded the war of aggression against Korea and forced the flames of war to our borders, Qian Baogong said: "Now I don't find all this strange at all, I can even say that it was expected. But I was once deceived by Marshall and the so-called American 'democracy and science.' I believe this experience may be a little helpful to those who have not yet recognized the true face of US imperialism."

　　一个技术人员认识美国的前后
    ——记东北化学工业管理局留美工程师钱宝功的谈话
    王坪
    日本投降后，国民党反动政府抢夺人民胜利果实，拚命“劫搜”，大力摧残民主，积极部署反人民的内战。使得武汉大学毕业生钱宝功无法安心从事科学钻研，大有“乌烟瘴气，举世茫茫，何处是研究科学的王国？”的感慨。这时候，美国发出的“谴责”国民党反动政府的舆论不断钻入钱宝功耳里，有如大热天喝着了凉水；圣诞节前夕，又来了“特使”马歇尔，蒋管区久盼和平的人们说他是“圣诞老人”；“马特使”下机伊始，发表了美国对华政策的“公正”谈话。钱宝功想：中国有希望了，我个人也有了出路——不在此时逃出法西斯化的国民党统治区以走向“民主与科学”的美国更待何时？他沾了租借援华法案的光，取得了公费留美的资格。
    他随着一大群去美国的青年，兴高采烈地踏进上海美国领事馆——在他们的心里，这是沙漠中的一片绿洲，但“绿洲”吹来的不是春风而是寒流。
    ——怎么？办理去美国的签证手续竟这样麻烦？需要填写的表格就有半寸那么厚！填写完后还要一—打手印（盖章还不行！这是多大的侮辱！）。其中有一项规定：没有二千美元的银行存款根本不准去美国。
    这是什么“民主”呢？
    等到他们上了外表富丽堂皇，而三等舱却乱七八糟的美国大邮船时，美国式的“民主”就更加清楚了：五百个人住的三等舱挤得像沙丁鱼罐头，舱里的烟尘汗臭，有点像国民党反动派统治地区似的透不过气来；而五十个人住的头等舱却高高在上，灯火辉煌，爵士音乐轻飘在碧海晴空。钱宝功这批留学生闷得没事干，便替船老板算起账来：三等舱的收入比头等舱的收入大几倍；三等舱的众人养活着船老板并贴补着头等舱的少数达官贵人的阔生活。
    这也许不能代表美国——到了美国再作道理。………
    他们看见插入云际的摩天大楼，不禁赞叹“那真是高度的文明！”可是，一句中国成语在这里有了具体的内容——可望而不可即！很多中国人被美国警察带到特别囚禁中国人的小岛上，为的是“手续不周”；有的人饿了很久不得上岸；有的人甚至在百般刁难的痛苦中跳海自杀；即使是侥幸上岸的，只有“二千美元的存款”，那里有走进摩天大厦的资格？！
    纽约市的形状像一条长虫，嘴尖上那一小块就是名闻全世界也就是为全世界所憎恨的华尔街；尾巴上一大段则是又穷又脏还是用古老的煤油灯的黑人区域（当他刚到美国时，有人告诉他纽约有煤油灯，他根本不相信）；绝大多数的中国人，只有资格与黑人为邻，钱宝功自然不能例外。他说：“那正好是我了解美国‘民主与文明’的好机会。”
    钱宝功到美国是为了学科学，所以他在国内便托美国朋友介绍他到有名的化学企业的工厂去实习，“杜邦公司”的答复是：没有空额，不予收留；其他地方也碰了壁。因为任何一个私人企业都有其“营业秘密”，不轻易收用一个外人。他只好到不太大的“雷荷德胶木工厂”实习，经理见到他的第一句话是：“实习可以，但是有两个条件：第一不准发问；第二不准记笔记！”万能的脑子，也没法记牢千种万种与千变万化的机器及其活动的本事。那些美国工程师，从不肯向外人透露一点他们所据有的知识；他们与人谈天气、谈跳舞；万万不会谈机器、谈科学。倒是爽快的美国工人，与他们混熟后，有时反而会偷偷的打开他所管理的机器的秘密。
    一九四八年，美国全国性的科学会议在纽约举行。钱宝功听说会后将参观纽约各大工厂，他设法参加了该会议。结果，所有的工厂都向科学家关了门；只有纽约市卫生局的工厂欢迎科学家们去参观——原来那是些掏阴沟、送粪便的工厂，谁爱参观谁就去。
    这能够学到甚么科学呢？有人主张像中国旧时代学手艺那样采取“偷艺”的办法，但钱宝功知道学科学必须要学一系列的理论和方法；零碎的“偷学”不会有好效果。他多方考虑，知道在该工厂继续“实习”下去，最大的前途是当一个“业务工程师”——实际上就是该工厂的货品推销员而已。
    他决定转到纽约理工学院学习。这时，国内的局势好转，人民解放军的反攻不断胜利。钱宝功与大部分热爱祖国的中国留学生一样，参加了各种进步活动，到处都在谈论着祖国的新形势。有一天，一位美国同学（后来知道他是美共党员）关心地告诉他：“最好不要在咖啡馆里谈论中国的事，美国特务比蒋介石的特务还要多、还要可恶！”有一次中国学生假国际大厦某一会场举行会议，蒋介石的特务在美国特务支持下前往捣乱，其方法卑鄙龌龊已极——他们在会场的沙发上大便；或者把铁针暗藏在沙发里。后来，钱宝功在一个美国同学召开的座谈会上，知道美国法西斯化的历史基础比德国还要深远（典型法西斯团体三Ｋ党就比纳粹党成立得早），以后又接受了德国法西斯的经验，故美国法西斯化的步骤及方法更其毒辣。不久，他所在的理工学院化学系副主任又被“非美活动委员会”检举了，他不禁为美国的“民主”不寒而栗。
    “民主”的真象彻底拆穿；科学又与金元一起变成大资本家血手中的“宝物”；使钱宝功窒息的蒋匪政权正在祖国的土地上土崩瓦解。他决定回国参预划时代的巨大变革。
    上海解放的第三天，他们登上了美国邮船向东方进发。说来也真有趣，同样坐在受罪的三等舱里，他们在赴美时逆来顺受；这次返国却处处看不顺眼，一有机会就与船主人争执吵闹。船到吴淞口，他们急于上岸，但船主人说：“上海共产党当局既不让人到船上办理手续，也不准你们乘小船上岸去办手续。我们只好折回香港。”他们不相信有这等怪事，便联名打电报给陈毅市长询问究竟。可是，美轮竟直往香港开。在快到香港时，船主才把陈市长的回电交给他们，电报上简明地写着：“君等上岸无须任何手续。”他们感到最后还受了美国骗子的挑拨与欺骗，非常愤慨，便与船主理论。美国骗子又装成一付“大方”的面孔说：“由吴淞口到香港的船钱不要你们出，这不是给你们很大的优待了吗？”但事实上是应该船主赔偿他们这一段冤枉路程的损失，因为他们根本不是赴香港。
    到香港以后才知道：该轮是奉了华盛顿的命令不进上海，以表示美帝对蒋匪在当时非法“封锁上海”的支持。
    钱宝功很快到了东北。祖国的建设远景展现在他眼前。他所服务的东北工业部化学工业管理局研究室，由一个狭小的房子里迁到一座丁字型的洋房里；原来的研究室办公处成为今天的职工食堂。他相信在几年以后，这个研究室会更扩大，更像一个研究室，并会从研究室中源源供应着各种研究成功的化工产品。就是现在这个研究室，这不到一年的时间，由于全体同志的努力，他们一方面干着艰苦的建设研究室的工作；一方面从事着研究，现在已经把磺化煤的制造研究成功。这对东北的化学工业是一重大贡献，因为普通的水质很“硬”，用这种水烧锅炉，大大缩短了锅炉的寿命。要把“硬水”变“软水”离开了磺化煤便不行。而且，磺化煤可以去掉海水的碱味，因此钱宝功工程师说：“将来解放台湾时，人民解放军可以一人带一包磺化煤渡海，便不怕没水喝。”
    根据他的这三段经验——国民党反动统治时期，留美时期及今天的新民主主义社会——使他深切地感到：只有人民掌权了的国家；只有用国家的力量来作有计划有步骤的发展科学；只有马列主义所倡导的理论与实践一致的研究方法，才能使科学得到真正的发展；科学工作者才有辉煌的前途和愉快的生活。
    当马歇尔这个大骗子在美帝发动侵朝战争的紧要关头担任了国防部长，紧接着就更加扩大了侵朝战争，并把侵略战火逼到了我们的边疆时，钱宝功说：“现在我对这一切毫不觉得奇怪了，甚至可以说是在意料之中。但我却一度受过马歇尔及所谓美国‘民主与科学’的蒙蔽。我相信这一段经历对于尚未认清美帝真相的人可能有点帮助。”
