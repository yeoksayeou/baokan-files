Xinhua News Agency, November 25th: The Standing Committee of the China People's Committee for World Peace and Against American Aggression held its first working conference today. The meeting discussed how to further lead the nationwide Resist America, Aid Korea, Protect the Homeland movement, which is currently unfolding enthusiastically among the people, and heard and discussed reports from various departments on their work since establishment.

　　The meeting unanimously agreed that the patriotic Resist America, Aid Korea, Protect the Homeland movement among the people throughout the country should continue to expand and deepen. This movement should develop universally from large cities to small and medium-sized cities and the vast rural areas; in several large cities where large-scale Resist America, Aid Korea movements have already been launched, this movement should shift to systematic ideological education against American aggression. It is also necessary to ensure that people from all walks of life earnestly do their jobs well in the patriotic movement to Resist America, Aid Korea, and Protect the Homeland. The meeting requested local branches and people's organizations to accept letters of appreciation, funds, and materials donated by local people to the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, and to assist patriotic people from all walks of life in carrying out various volunteer activities, and to provide a list of the number of items of appreciation to the China People's Committee for World Peace and Against American Aggression for processing.

　　The meeting also agreed to establish five committees under the leadership of the Propaganda Department of the Standing Committee, namely, Special Publication, Broadcasting, Art, Anthology, and Exhibition, to carry out various propaganda activities for Resist America, Aid Korea, and Protect the Homeland to the people across the country. It was also decided to rename the "World Peace Special Publication," originally edited by the China World Peace Congress in the People's Daily, to "Resist America, Aid Korea" Special Publication, and plans to publish it simultaneously in major newspapers in Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and other places.

　　Regarding organizational work, the Organization Department reported that local branches of the China People's Committee for World Peace and Against American Aggression have been established in thirteen places, including Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai. The meeting requested that major administrative regions, provinces, and cities that have not yet established such branches should do so quickly and establish contact with the general headquarters.

　　After discussing the work of the Liaison Department of the Standing Committee, the meeting decided to send a telegram supporting the Second World Peace Congress's declaration to the people of the world and other resolutions.
