　　The Crimes of American Imperialism When it Controlled Chinese Customs
　　·Wei Jin·
　　For a hundred years, American imperialists colluded with Chinese reactionaries, signing unequal treaties and plundering our country's customs autonomy under the guise of the "Open Door" policy. Especially during the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, in 1943, under the pretext of "abolishing unequal treaties," the American, L.L. T. Stinebower, seized the position of Inspector General of Customs for the whole country. On November 4, 1946, Chiang Kai-shek and the United States signed the traitorous "Sino-American Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation," and on October 16, 1947, Chiang Kai-shek and the United States established the "General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade" in Havana and signed the "Tariff Reduction Agreement" in Shanghai. From these treaties, it was stipulated that American imperialism could enjoy the privilege of extremely low tariffs or even exemption from tariffs; American imperialism could navigate in any port, American ships could load and unload goods along the way and freely choose "shortcuts," and "no transit tax should be levied"; American imperialism could control the management of customs and the revenue and expenditure of tariffs. Thus, our country's customs sovereignty was completely lost and entirely controlled by American imperialism.
　　After American imperialism controlled our country's customs, it used the many privileges it enjoyed to carry out cruel economic and military aggression against our country.
　　American imperialism implemented a large-scale dumping policy. On the one hand, it openly transported large quantities of goods; on the other hand, it openly engaged in smuggling. There was a great variety of smuggling methods. According to the Shanghai United Evening News on June 15, 1946, smuggling methods included "first, foreign (American) merchant sailors carrying goods; second, Allied (American) military ships and aircraft personnel carrying goods; third, Hong Kong, India, and other places using aircraft to smuggle diamonds, silverware, etc.; fourth, foreign postal parcels carrying goods; fifth, professional smugglers bringing goods from other places." In addition, American imperialism also used diplomatic personnel to smuggle. According to international law, diplomatic personnel could bring luggage without inspection. Diplomatic personnel used this "privilege" to collude with important Chinese and American figures to engage in large-scale smuggling. In addition, American imperialism disguised its robber behavior of smuggling by transferring surplus materials and using "UN Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) relief materials." The transfer of surplus materials included a large amount of military supplies, which strengthened the military power of the Kuomintang reactionaries to expand the civil war.
　　As a result of the open and smuggled imports of American goods, our country's market was almost monopolized by American imperialism. According to statistics, in 1946, American trade with China accounted for 57.16 percent of our total imports, and in 1947 it was 50.15 percent. However, these are just the statistical figures from the customs register; various forms of smuggling were not included.
　　The occupation of our country's market by American goods greatly damaged our national industry. According to the Shanghai Wenhui Daily on February 2, 1947, "Shanghai's famous Jiu Fu Match Factory could not compete with American matches and closed down on May 10, 1945." "The sales volume of the wool textile industry in August, September, and October 1945 was only 500,000 yards, while the sales volume of American goods reached one million yards, a difference of half." Therefore, "just when woolen goods were urgently needed in the harsh winter, the Da Lun Wool Textile Factory closed down first, followed by the Ya Zhong Wool Textile Factory." Shanghai's "stocking industry originally had more than 500 factories. Since June 1946, a large number of American nylon stockings have been imported and sold at low prices," so "the entire stocking market has been monopolized by nylon stockings, and factories can only operate for two or three hours. As a result, more than a dozen large manufacturers in the industry, such as China, Qinyi, Hua'an, and Fukang, have all suspended operations." "The hat-making industry in our country, which has a history of more than 20 years, has declined sharply from an annual output of 500,000 dozen to 200,000 dozen due to the United States' restriction on wool exports and the large-scale export of finished products, making it precarious and difficult to maintain." Shanghai's vegetable markets and food stores are filled with American canned foods, giving people the feeling of being in another country. Of the city's total of more than 180 canned food manufacturers, only 50 or so remained before January 10 of that year. The situation in other industries, such as the leather industry, the paper industry, the cigarette industry, the new medicine industry, and the cement industry, was equally bleak. With the decline and closure of factories, unemployment among workers increased daily. At the end of 1946, there were 800,000 unemployed workers in Shanghai alone, and nearly 100,000 unemployed workers in Chengdu.
　　Another disaster that American imperialism inflicted on the Chinese people by controlling our country's customs was hindering the progress of the revolutionary liberation war. In June 1947, the Inspector General of Customs, L.L. T. Stinebower, secretly telegraphed the Tianjin, Qinhuangdao, and Qingdao customs offices, ordering them to stop any ships coming from and going to liberated areas such as Yantai, Weihaiwei, and Longkou, and not to issue export licenses for goods. In September 1947, L.L. T. Stinebower sent a map of the coastal liberated areas to the Jianghai Customs and instructed them to implement a transportation and economic blockade against our liberated areas. In 1948, L.L. T. Stinebower secretly ordered customs police on the Sino-Hong Kong-Macau border to cooperate with the Guangdong puppet security team to attack the people's troops. At the same time, he planned to hire Kong Xiangxi's second son (who studied at the German Army University) as the captain of the customs police to expand customs armed forces and strengthen resistance against the People's Army. On the eve of the liberation of South China, L.L. T. Stinebower ordered customs ships to secretly transport military supplies from Hong Kong to Guangdong for T. V. Soong. On the eve of the liberation of Shanghai, L.L. T. Stinebower secretly ordered customs transport ships to transport large amounts of gold and silver, as well as priceless antiques and jewelry, to Taiwan and Hong Kong for the four major families and the puppet Central Bank.
　　The customs under the control of American imperialism had many dark secrets in its management system. The Inspector General of Customs held all the power, and the Commissioners of Customs of each customs house had to absolutely obey the orders of the Inspector General of Customs. The Inspector General of Customs could arbitrarily manipulate customs revenue; the allocation of customs revenue to the Kuomintang government had to be approved by the Inspector General of Customs. The Inspector General of Customs was once called the "Supreme Minister of Finance." The Inspector General of Customs implemented slavish education for customs officials. English became the "official language" of the customs, and even official documents between the Ministry of Finance of the Kuomintang government and the Inspector General of Customs had to be translated into English. L.L. T. Stinebower's salary was frighteningly high: a monthly "basic salary" of 700 pounds sterling, equivalent to more than 2,800 US dollars, or about 87.3 million RMB. This figure was equal to the total monthly salaries of 200 middle-ranking customs officials, not including L.L. T. Stinebower's entertainment expenses, hospitality fees, etc.
　　For a hundred years, the disasters that American imperialism has inflicted on the Chinese people by controlling Chinese customs are countless. What has been discussed here is just an outline.

　　美帝控制中国海关时的罪恶
    ·维进·
    百年来，美帝国主义者与中国反动派狼狈为奸，签订不平等条约，掠夺我国海关自主权，美其名曰“门户开放”政策。特别是在国民党反动统治时期，一九四三年在所谓“取消不平等条约”的名义下，美国人李度攫得了全国总税务司的位置；一九四六年十一月四日蒋匪又与美国签订了卖国的“中美商约”，一九四七年十月十六日蒋美在哈瓦那成立了“国际关税与贸易的一般协定”，以及在上海签订了“关税减让协定”。——从这些条约里，规定美帝可以享受极低微的关税甚至免除关税的特权；美帝可以在任何一个港口通航，美船可以沿途起卸货物，且可自由选择“捷径”，“不得课以任何过境税”；美帝可以掌握海关管理和关税收支的大权。——于是我国海关主权丧失殆尽，完全为美帝所控制。
    美帝控制我国海关后，利用所享受的许多特权，对我国进行残酷的经济侵略与军事侵略。
    美帝实行大量的倾销政策。一方面公开地运进大量商品；一方面公然走私。走私的花样应有尽有，据一九四六年六月十五日上海联合晚报称：走私的方法“一是外国（美国）商轮水手夹带；二是盟军（美军）军舰及军用飞机人员夹带；三是香港、印度诸方面利用飞机私运钻石、银件等；四是外国寄来邮包夹带；五是职业走私者自外地带来。”另外，美帝还利用外交人员走私。按照国际法，外交人员带行李可以免查。外交人员利用这种“特权”，勾结中美要人，大做其走私买卖。此外，美帝借着转让剩余物资的名义，及借着“联总救济物资”的名义，掩饰他们走私的强盗行为。在转让剩余物资一项，包括了大批军火，这些军火加强了国民党反动派扩大内战的军事力量。
    美货公开的与走私的输入结果，我国市场便几乎为美帝所独占。据统计，一九四六年美帝对华贸易占我国进口总额百分之五七·一六，一九四七年为百分之五○·一五。然而这只是根据海关册的统计数字，各种方式的走私还没有计算在内的。
    美货占领我国市场，使我国民族工业受到极大的摧残。据一九四七年二月二日上海文汇报称：“上海著名的九福火柴厂无法与美国火柴竞争，于一九四五年五月十日关门停工”。“毛纺织业在一九四五年八、九、十三个月内，销售量仅五十万码，而美货销售量达百万码，相差一半。”因此，“正当严冬需要毛织品紧急之时，先有大纶毛织厂的关门，继有亚中毛织厂的关门”。上海“制袜业原有五百余家，自一九四六年六月以后，美国玻璃袜大批输入，并且售价低廉”，所以“整个制袜业市场，为玻璃丝袜所独占，厂家只得开工二、三小时。结果，该业大型厂商如中国、勤益、华安、福康等十多家全部停工”。“在我国有二十余年历史的制帽业，因美国限制羊毛出口而又大量输出制成品，于是制帽业一落千丈，由年产五十万打降为二十万打，岌岌可危，难于维持”。上海的菜市场及食品店，无不堆满美货罐头食品，使人有处身他国之感。全市共有一百八十余家的罐头厂商，至该年一月十日前的统计，只剩得五十余家了。其他如皮革工业、造纸业、卷烟工业、新药工业、水泥工业的景况，同样惨淡。随着工厂的衰落、倒闭，工人失业日增。一九四六年底上海一地失业工人达八十万，成都失业工人将近十万。
    美帝控制我国海关给予中国人民的另一祸害，就是阻碍革命解放战争的进展。一九四七年六月，海关总税务司李度，曾密电天津、秦皇岛、青岛三关，凡发现由烟台、威海卫、龙口等解放区来往的船只，应一律令其停航，并不得发给货物出口证。一九四七年九月，李度将沿海解放区地图发交江海关，并指示对我解放区实行交通经济封锁。一九四八年李度密令中、港、澳边界海关关警与广东伪保安队合作，攻击人民部队；同时并拟聘用孔祥熙次子（曾留学德国陆军大学）充任关警总队长，以扩充海关武装，加强对人民军队的抵抗。当华南解放前夕，李度命令海关舰艇为宋子文由香港密运军火至广东；上海解放前夕，李度密令海关运输船，为四大家族及伪中央银行，运输大量的黄金白银，和价值连城的古物珠宝到台湾和香港。
    美帝控制下的海关，在管理制度上是黑幕层层。总税务司掌握一切权力，各关税务司必须绝对遵从总税务司的命令。总税务司可以任意操纵关余；关余拨给国民党政府，必须经过总税务司批准。总税务司曾有“太上财政总长”之称。总税务司对于关员实行奴化教育，英文成为海关的“官方语文”，即使国民党政府财政部与总税务司来往的公文，也必须译成英文。总税务司李度的薪金高得怕人。每月“正薪”七百英镑，合二千八百多美元，约合人民币八千七百三十多万元。这个数字，等于二百个中等关员每月薪金的总和。而李度的交际费、招待费等还不包括在内。
    百年来，美帝控制中国海关所给予中国人民的灾害是数不清的，这里所谈的只是一个梗概。
