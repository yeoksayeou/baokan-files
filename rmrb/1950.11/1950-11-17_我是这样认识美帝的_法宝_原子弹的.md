This is How I Understand the American Imperialists' "Magic Weapon," the Atomic Bomb
	Normal University Chen Kuanchang

　　In the current study of current affairs, the atomic bomb is a very important topic. If this issue is resolved, the fear of American imperialism will be easily swept away.
    At first, when I encountered this problem, I still liked to solve it theoretically, and I read many articles about the atomic bomb. When we discussed this issue at the discussion meeting, I said very directly: "The atomic bomb is certainly not scary." I also really knew and explained: "First, the atomic bomb cannot be used on the battlefield; second, the Soviet Union also has atomic bombs; third, the facts prove that the atomic bomb is also a defensive weapon; ......" After the meeting, I thought like this in my mind: "If an atomic bomb is dropped on my head, that would be terrible!" "The atomic bomb can indeed kill many people!" The shadow hiding behind this thought was: "Although the atomic bomb is not very scary, it is indeed much more terrifying than other weapons!"
    I began to feel distressed. I spent a lot of time thinking about this issue. Now I am clear: this is entirely individualism at work, putting personal interests before the interests of the whole country, and putting personal death above the survival of the whole and the country; only seeing oneself, without or forgetting the whole and the country. Of course, for the individual, the atomic bomb is a terrible weapon, but isn't an enemy's gun, a special agent's knife, or an American bomb equally capable of causing personal death? Then, a gun and a knife are also scary. Why not be afraid of the enemy's guns and cannons, the special agent's poisonous knife, but only be afraid of the atomic bomb? Isn't that too ridiculous?
    Now I have completely recognized that the atomic bomb, which American imperialism regards as a magic weapon, is really not scary at all. This understanding allows me to more completely despise American imperialism and strengthens my confidence in the victory of the people of the world.

　　我是这样认识美帝的“法宝”原子弹的
    师大  陈宽肠
    在目前学习时事问题当中，原子弹是一个很重要的题目。这个问题解决了，对美帝国主义的恐惧就很容易扫除。
    最先，我碰到这个问题，照样喜欢从理论上去解决，看了许多关于原子弹的文章。开讨论会的时候，谈到这个问题，我就很直截了当地说：“原子弹当然不可怕。”我也确实知道并且说明：“第一、原子弹不能在战场上使用；第二、苏联也有原子弹；第三、事实证明原子弹也是可以防御的武器；……。”开完会以后，我脑子里却又这么想了：“假如在头上丢一个原子弹，可了不得！”“原子弹的确能杀死很多人！”躲在这思想后面的背影，就是：“原子弹虽不十分可怕，但到底比其他武器可怕得多！”
    我开始感到苦恼了。我用很多时间来思索这个问题。现在我清楚了：这完全是个人主义在作怪，把个人的利益放在全体的国家的利益前头，把个人的死超越在全体的、国家的存亡上面；只看到自己，没有或忘记了全体和国家。当然，对个人自己来说，原子弹是一种可怕的武器，但是一枝敌人的枪，一把特务用的小刀，一个美国的炸弹，不是同样可以致个人生命于死地么！那么，一枝枪，一把刀也是可怕的。何以不怕敌人的枪炮，特务的毒刀，而独怕原子弹，那不是太可笑了吗？
    我现在彻底认清了美帝国主义自以为法宝的原子弹，实实在在并不可怕。这一认识使我能更完全地蔑视美帝国主义，更加强了对世界人民胜利的信心。
