　　Fully Support the Korean Aid Volunteer Army
    ——Letters from People Across the Country to the Korean Front and This Newspaper
    Over Ten Thousand Workers in Chengde, Inspired by the Victory, Cheer: Long Live the People's Volunteer Army
    To All Comrades of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army:
    As the heinous American imperialism invaded Korea and ignited the flames of war towards our border, you volunteered to assist the Korean people, defend the motherland's frontier, and bravely crossed the Yalu River. Under the command of the Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army, you fought valiantly against the enemy alongside the fraternal Korean forces. Your high degree of internationalism and patriotism is a good example for the Chinese people. Under your and the Korean People's Army's heroic fighting, you recovered eight cities in eleven days, eliminating over six thousand enemies. We, over ten thousand workers in Chengde City, are all elated and encouraged by this great victory. At the same time, we will intensify production, make a hundred times more effort, and launch a production competition movement to produce more materials to support you. We hope you will continue to bravely pursue and kill the enemy, resolutely demand blood debts for the Chinese people who have been bombed, and avenge the peace-loving people of Korea. Victory will surely belong to the people! We shout: Long live the victory of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army! Long live the unity of the Chinese and Korean people!

    Determined to Intensify Production, Work Actively, and Strengthen Support for the Volunteer Army
    Chinese People's Aid Korea Volunteer Army:
    With the spirit of patriotism and internationalism in defending the motherland and world peace, you oppose the aggression of American imperialism, volunteer to join the Chinese People's Aid Korea Forces, assist our neighbor and friend—the Korean People's Army—and go to the battlefield to bravely annihilate the enemy. Your righteous act of fighting for justice is worthy of our respect, learning, support, and assistance.
    Yesterday, we saw the great news in the Suiyuan Daily extra edition that you and the Korean People's Army jointly annihilated the American imperialists and recovered eight cities, which made us infinitely excited. In addition to joy and excitement, we are determined to learn from your example and strive to strengthen our support for you in our actual work.
    Here, we intensify production, work actively, study hard, protect factories, eliminate hidden bandits and special agents, and maintain social security; and we are ready at any time with unlimited loyalty to go to the battlefield to support you, until the American imperialists are completely wiped out. We wish you brave advancement and eternal victory!

    Strive to Do a Good Job in Production, Prevent Special Agents from Sabotaging, and Donate Some Soap, Towels, and Socks to Express Our Feelings
    Editor:
    We are the workers of the Dejuhao Oil, Salt, and Grain Store in the Fourth District. After the liberation of Beijing, we gained true democracy and freedom, turned over politically, and our lives have been improved. Our working class-led country is engaged in peaceful construction, but today, American imperialism dares to launch a war of aggression against Korea, obstruct our liberation of Taiwan, bomb our land, kill our worker brothers, and undermine our peaceful construction. We recognize that American imperialism is our great enemy, and we resolutely support the joint declaration of the democratic parties, decide to do a good job in production, ensure the completion of government tax revenue, smash special agent rumors, prevent special agents from disrupting the economy, and strive to support the Korean front in order to thoroughly defeat the aggression of American imperialism. To comfort the Chinese People's Volunteer Army fighting in Korea, we now offer a little of our heart—three hundred bars of soap, eight dozens of towels, and six dozens of socks. Please forward them to our heroic volunteer army.
    All Workers of Dejuhao Oil, Salt, and Grain Store

    All Members of the Beijing No. 3 Middle School Education Trade Union Buy Towels for the Volunteer Army to Express Their Enthusiastic Support
    Editor:
    All comrades of our school's trade union are very resentful of the aggressive crimes of the American robbers. After the publication of the joint declaration of the democratic parties, three teachers and staff members of our school have signed up to join the volunteer army, willing to dedicate their lives in the struggle against American aggression and aid to Korea. The remaining comrades use concrete actions such as intensifying the study of current events, recognizing American imperialism, uniting the masses, working hard in propaganda, redoubling their work, and teaching regular classes well to resist American aggression and aid Korea. We also donated some money to buy sixty towels, hoping you will forward them to the Aid Korea Volunteer Army to express our enthusiastic support.

    Members of the Taiyuan No. 2 Power Plant Youth League Are Willing to Make the Greatest Efforts to Support the Korean Front
    Comrades of the heroic Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army:
    We extend our greatest concern to you and pay our highest respect to your spirit of heroic resistance. Moreover, we are making our greatest efforts to strengthen production and support the war against aggression. When necessary, we will not hesitate to sacrifice everything and join your ranks, vowing to fight the aggressors to the end. We believe that final victory will surely belong to the people. Finally, we shout: Long live the victory of the heroic Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army to Resist American Aggression and Aid Korea!

    我们是第四区德聚号油盐粮店的工人。北京解放后，我们得到了真正的民主自由，在政治上翻了身，生活得到了改善。我们工人阶级领导的国家正在和平建设，但是，今天美帝国主义竟敢发动侵朝战争，阻挠我们解放台湾，轰炸我们土地，炸死我们工人弟兄，破坏我们的和平建设。我们认清了美帝国主义是我们的大敌人，我们坚决拥护各民主党派的联合宣言，决定把生产搞好，保证完成政府税收，粉碎特务谣言，防止特务捣乱经济，努力支援朝鲜前线，为彻底打垮美帝国主义的侵略而奋斗。为了慰劳去朝作战的中国人民志愿部队，现在把我们的一点心意——肥皂三百条，毛巾八打，袜子六打供献出来。请你转给我们的英勇的志愿部队。
