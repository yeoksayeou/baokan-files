The American Economic Crisis is Unsurmountable
Introducing Several Books on the American Economic Crisis
Chen Chi

*Economic Crisis and the Cold War*, by Gus Hall, William Z. Foster et al., published by World Knowledge Press
*Trends of American Capitalism*, compiled by the American Labor Research Association, published by the Fifties Press
*The Coming American Panic*, compiled and translated by Yu Huai, published by Sanlian Bookstore
*The American Economic Crisis*, by Jiang Xuemo, published by World Knowledge Press
*The International Situation After the Korean War*, by Chen Hanbo, published by World Knowledge Press

Is the United States strong? The United States is strong, but not genuinely strong. Strength is superficial, but we must not underestimate the enemy; weakness is inherent, and we must despise the enemy. It is just as Chairman Mao succinctly said: the United States is a paper tiger!

The weakness of the United States is rooted in the increasingly declining world capitalism, especially the precarious situation of the American capitalist economy. The collapse of American imperialism’s economy is a destiny already written by history.

The collapse of the American economy is due to the American economic crisis, and we should study and familiarize ourselves with this fatal weakness of the enemy.

Among the five books introduced here, the first worth mentioning is *Economic Crisis and the Cold War*, written by American Communist leaders Foster, Allen, and others, which is the result of collective research by American Marxist economists. The second is *Trends of American Capitalism*, compiled by the progressive American "Labor Research Association" (in addition to the Fifties Press translation, World Knowledge Press also has a translation), which is not a book specifically discussing the crisis, but a good book that comprehensively studies the American economy based on the main outline of Marxist political economy. The third is *The Coming American Panic*, compiled and translated by Yu Huai based on the original work by Fritz Sternberg. This book is relatively old and does not contain new materials from the recent two years, and as the compiler pointed out, some of its views are "quite debatable if measured by strict Marxist-Leninist doctrines." For example, the author one-sidedly interprets Marx's statement that a nation that oppresses others is not free itself, and makes the assertion that "imperialism has eased domestic contradictions" for the imperialist powers before 1929 (Chapter 3). However, the author has made a more in-depth study of certain characteristics of the current economic crisis (Chapters 4 and 5).

The above three books cannot be considered popular works. *The American Economic Crisis*, written by Jiang Xuemo, is a more popular read. The booklet *The International Situation After the Korean War*, written by Chen Hanbo, has a section on the American war economy, which includes the latest materials.

The causes of the economic crisis and the American economic situation are discussed in Chapters 1 to 3 of *Economic Crisis and the Cold War*, Chapters 2 to 6 of *Trends of American Capitalism*, Chapters 1 and 5 of *The Coming American Panic*, and Chapter 4 of *The American Economic Crisis*.

Signs of the American economic crisis were already apparent in 1947, but the formal prelude was unveiled in the autumn of 1948. The characteristic of this American economic crisis is its slow and gradual development, unlike the 1929 world capitalist crisis, which began with a violent storm in a short period. The reason for this phenomenon is inseparable from the expansionist policy of American imperialism. The expansion of armaments and dumping abroad have acted as a stimulant to American production. This illusion of market absorption has maintained the illusion of prosperity in American production. Secondly, monopoly capital and its White House servants have tried their best to maintain high domestic monopoly prices, shifting the losses of the panic onto the working people, and also making the financial stock and price markets take a slow downward path, concealing the violence of the crisis. But all this "makes the crisis particularly painful and more bankrupt for the main consumers of commodities—the people—while at the same time it cannot but prolong the crisis and hinder its dissipation." (Stalin's report to the 16th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party).

The reason for the capitalist economic crisis is the contradiction between production and consumption, which is already common knowledge. In short, it is as follows: "The main task of capitalism is to find a favorable market for the ever-increasing commodities. The contradiction of capitalist production is manifested in its inability to solve this market problem. A favorable solution means prosperity; no solution means panic." (*The Coming American Panic*, Chapter 1)

To what extent has the contradiction between production and consumption in American imperialism reached? Here are some figures used in these books: American capitalist production currently accounts for two-thirds of the total production of world capitalism (before World War II, it accounted for 45 percent). The total value of American industrial production, taking the average of 1935 to 1939 as 100, reached a peak of 239 in 1943 during the war. Afterwards, due to the slow development of the crisis, it declined year by year. In 1946 after the war, it was 170, and in 1947, it was 186; with 1937 as 100, it was 175 in October 1948 and fell to 137 in October 1949, but the level for the whole of 1949 was still roughly equal to 1946. This illustrates two facts: on the one hand, the crisis has developed, and on the other hand, productivity is still enormous. On the contrary, the profits of American capitalists have been increasing all the time. Looking only at the surface figures reported by the capitalists, the average annual profit of capitalists was 3.06 billion yuan in the five years before World War II, 8.46 billion yuan annually on average in the five years during the war, and due to the abolition of price controls in 1946 after the war, profits suddenly increased to 12.5 billion yuan, continuing to increase to 17.4 billion yuan in 1947, 24.6 billion yuan in 1948, and an estimated 26.5 billion yuan in 1949. According to Truman's estimate, it may break through 30 billion in 1950 and reach 30.5 billion, which is equal to ten times the pre-war level. This is the "strength" of the United States. This "strength" is the result of the concentration of wealth, and the result of "one family laughing while ten thousand families are grieving." The more "powerful" it becomes, the deeper its crisis becomes. The higher it climbs, the harder it falls, which is an inevitable principle.

On the other hand, let's look at some figures on the American market's consumption capacity. The income of the American working people is the opposite of the income of the capitalists, and it has been declining year by year. "The increase in wages often lags behind productivity, so the increase in labor productivity instead causes a decrease in the proportion of workers' income in national production, which in turn increases profits. Therefore, the strengthening of exploitation of workers more easily promotes the trend of depression." (*Trends of American Capitalism*, Chapter 6) The profit that capitalists exploit from each worker increased four to nine times from the base of 1939 to 1947-1948, while the actual wages of workers decreased by 15-16 percent in 1948-1949 compared to 1945. This does not include the large unemployed population. As for unemployment, according to the reduced official figures alone, the number of fully unemployed workers was close to 5 million in early 1950, plus partially unemployed workers, totaling 18 million. The income of the broad American working people cannot maintain their minimum living budget.

In this way, the huge productivity of the United States cannot find a satisfactory market domestically. As for the international market, do not forget that the economic crisis of American imperialism is a major link in the general crisis of world capitalism. "Under the promotion of the general crisis, and due to the huge world role of the American economy, symbols of serious unemployment, overproduction, and market shrinkage are appearing simultaneously in many capitalist countries. This has also strengthened the panic component in the American economy." (*Economic Crisis and the Cold War*, Chapter 1)

That is to say, the conspiracy of American imperialism to solve its economic crisis by preying on the people of Britain, Western Europe, and Latin America is impossible to realize. Although the reactionaries of various countries are willing to be the docile dogs of Wall Street, they can never turn an empty market into an existing market.

It should also be pointed out here that overproduction and insufficient consumption are in fact frequent potential phenomena in capitalist society. Since a large part of social production goes into the pockets of capitalists, the broad masses of people are of course unable to consume this part of social production. In normal times, capitalists can invest this part of surplus production in the production of means of production, which is a part that can temporarily develop blindly without relying on the consumption power of the people. However, the means of production must ultimately rely on the consumer goods production sector to purchase, while the consumer goods production relies on the consumption ability of the broad masses of people. Therefore, when the people's consumption capacity is reduced to the point where the production of means of production also experiences overproduction, the crisis will develop drastically. "The deepest contradiction in capitalist production is not in the production sector of consumer goods, but in the sector that produces production tools. The expansion of an investment market without the backing of a broad and expanding consumer market only deepens the severity of the capitalist crisis." (Compiler's preface to *The Coming American Panic*) The characteristic of the current American economy is not only the decline in the production of consumer goods, but also the decline in the production of means of production. In other words, the crisis has spread to all sectors, and there is no way out for the surplus production anymore.

How does American imperialism deal with this crisis? Foster's article "Truman's 'Managed Economy' and the War Crisis" in *Economic Crisis and the Cold War* has an excellent description. Chapters 1 to 3 of the same book, Chapter 7 of *Trends of American Capitalism*, Chapters 4, 5 and 7 of *The Coming American Panic*, and Chapters 2 and 4 of *The American Economic Crisis* also have descriptions.

Foster pointed out that American imperialism fears that this serious economic panic will be worse than the world economic general crisis that broke out in 1929. Such a panic will inevitably destroy the aggressive ambitions of American imperialism and create revolutionary consequences that will subvert the world capitalist system. The only way to solve it is to implement a violent and universal reduction or elimination of capitalists' profits within the scope of world capitalism, but this strategy of turning ghosts into humans, a strategy of eliminating the capitalist system, is of course not acceptable to capitalism. Thus, the only countermeasure that American imperialism can adopt is the so-called "managed economy" policy advocated by the Keynesians and implemented by the Truman government. Foster also pointed out that the so-called "managed economy" is by no means a socialist planned economy. In a social system where capitalists, each privately owned, strive to preserve and expand their huge profits in competition and destroy their competitors, it is impossible to implement a system of planned production and consumption. Therefore, the essence of "managed economy" is to fill the emptiness of the market and delay and reduce the economic panic with huge government expenditures. Government expenditures are mainly borne by the people's taxes, which is to shift the losses of the crisis onto the working masses. The fact is very clear that this policy only further weakens the people's purchasing power. It may be able to delay the time of the crisis; but it further increases the poverty and suffering of the people and makes the crisis deeper.

One of the policies of the "managed economy" is for the government to build various public works on a large scale to accommodate the unemployed population, and to adopt a peaceful foreign policy to win markets, especially the huge markets of people's democratic countries. This is the policy advocated by American liberals and implemented by Roosevelt. It has a certain effect on reducing the crisis, but it cannot fundamentally avoid the crisis. Moreover, this policy is opposed by big capitalists, because this policy must increase the tax burden of big capitalists in order to be effectively implemented. Chapter 7 of *Trends of American Capitalism* has a good description of this.

Another policy, which is the policy currently implemented by the Truman government, is the crazy expansion of armaments and the implementation of predatory foreign trade.

Although the capitalist world market is completely unable to absorb the massive production of the United States, and although the historical American foreign exports have never exceeded 10 percent of the huge production of the United States (the American market is mainly domestic), American imperialism still cannot but be forced to find a way out in foreign markets. This way out cannot be obtained in the normal market, so it cannot but be predatory, "bound to be 'found' largely at the expense of other countries" (*Economic Crisis and the Cold War*, Chapter 1). That is to say, this relies on the following series of means to ensure that the goal is achieved: - monopolistic dumping abroad, breaking the tariff barriers of other capitalist countries, compulsory purchase of American goods, prohibition of purchasing goods from other countries, and even compulsory prohibition of other countries from producing certain products in their own countries. However, in this way, it is bound to cause further damage to the capitalist economy of other countries, and the final result is not the expansion but the shrinking of the world market!

This predatory export is conditional on American financial support, because only with continuous financial loans can the reactionaries of other countries in the economic crisis be tempted to submit to the slaughter of American imperialism. "In the first three years after the war, the trade surplus reached 25.6 billion US dollars, of which three-fifths were supported by the US government in the form of loans and grants. The difficulty of the economic situation of American imperialism lies in the fact that because of the abundant food and raw material resources of the United States, the price of a large amount of exports and the interests of a large amount of overseas investment cannot be realized through imports in any period." (*Economic Crisis and the Cold War*, Chapter 1) Therefore, this predatory foreign export, in the final analysis, still depends on the expenditure of the US government.

The ultimate goal of this predatory export is to lead to the American military aggression plan. "The export of capital mostly takes the form of government grants and loans, and is linked with an aggressive foreign policy." (*Economic Crisis and the Cold War*, Chapter 1) American imperialism is attempting to unite the reactionaries of other countries through global arms expansion, prepare to launch a war against the Soviet Union and people's democratic countries, in order to conquer the people of these countries and expand the colonial market of capitalism.

Domestically, "capitalists believe that war orders and the war itself are necessary to maintain industry" (Foster's article). However, neither domestic arms expansion nor international arms expansion can save the arrival of the economic crisis. At most, it only gains temporary respite by intensifying the exploitation of the people. Because both military production and military expenditure are out of the normal production and circulation range and become an absolute consumption. The customer of the military market is the government, not any production unit or the people. All military consumables cannot be put back into production. This additional market can of course stimulate a certain development of production, and this market must continue to expand in order to meet the requirements of the constantly accumulated capital expansion. However, where does the government's military expenditure come from? It must be mainly borne by the working people. Although the arms race can reduce the number of unemployed, it lowers the income of the entire working people. Therefore, the greater the military expenditure, the lower the income of the people, the smaller the market, and the result will inevitably lead to vicious inflation, which is enough to destroy the entire socio-economic life of the United States. To sum up in one sentence, "It is becoming increasingly clear that the huge 'Cold War' expenditure cannot prevent the developing crisis of overproduction in the United States." (*Economic Crisis and the Cold War*, Chapter 6)

Finally, let's talk about the general crisis of the capitalist world economy. The greatest attempt of American imperialism is to save its fate of collapse by aggressive wars. Is this possible? *Economic Crisis and the Cold War* answers this question: "The situation of the general crisis of capitalism, especially the further shift of world power towards socialism and democracy, makes it difficult for monopoly capital to find a way out of its current crisis situation by war." (Chapter 1) This question is mentioned in Chapters 1 and 2 of *Economic Crisis and the Cold War*, Chapters 5 and 6 of *The Coming American Panic*, and Chapter 5 of *The American Economic Crisis*. The characteristics of the general crisis of capitalism can be summarized as follows:

1. This crisis includes the entire capitalist world. Therefore, the struggle between various imperialist countries for the market is very fierce. No matter how American imperialism shows its teeth and claws, the contradictions between imperialists cannot be eliminated. On the other hand, the awakening power of the masses under the crisis is rising day by day. The more profound the crisis (for example, the United Kingdom, France, other Western European countries, West Germany, and Japan, which have been more affected by war damage), the greater the awakening power of the people and the faster it develops. Every step that imperialism takes towards war, and every step that the people's lives decline, will inevitably lead to a corresponding and continuous upsurge of the people's resistance struggle.

2. This crisis is a combination of industrial crisis and agricultural crisis. In the crisis before the general crisis of capitalism, undeveloped agriculture could be used as a buffer for the industrial crisis and was the object of opening up new markets. But now, capitalism in agriculture has also developed to the point of overproduction. In colonial countries, the feudal and semi-feudal agricultural systems certainly still breed sufficient market absorption capacity. However, since American imperialism relies on the feudal reactionaries in these countries, it naturally cannot but preserve the feudal and semi-feudal systems in these countries, and destroy the development of the agricultural market in these countries.

3. More than 800 million people around the world have broken away from the world scope of capitalism and are standing in the socialist people's camp, which has made the scope of the capitalist market shrink unprecedentedly. And the economic construction of these people's democratic countries, especially the Soviet Union, is leaping forward at a high speed. Today, the people's power is unprecedentedly strong.

4. In all colonial and semi-colonial countries, the national armed struggles against imperialism are also expanding victoriously and are beginning to establish people's democratic countries, which will continue to narrow the rule of the capitalist world.

Therefore, the imperialist attempt to win new markets by aggressive wars is completely impossible. "The movement of American monopoly capital to dominate the world cannot defeat the growth of the anti-imperialist united forces in the world, and it has become clearer." (*Economic Crisis and the Cold War*, Chapter 6)

After studying these books, we can see that the American imperialism's economy is the highest peak that capitalism can reach. As Marx said, it is precisely the "last word" of capitalism. Through this crisis, the capitalist world will inevitably undergo a fundamental decline, and the power of the socialist people will inevitably undergo a fundamental rise. The future of the death of capitalism can already be seen. However, the American imperialists will not be willing to die. They will continue to struggle in despair, and they will strive to risk launching a war. The people of the world should unite and work harder to stop the imperialists' war preparations, and suppress the imperialists' war conspiracy with greater strength. If the enemy stubbornly launches a war, then resolutely eliminate it in the war.

    美国是强的吗？美国是强的，然而并不真正强。强是表面的，但是我们也不可轻敌；不强是本质的，我们要藐视敌人。这就如同毛主席所简括地说的：美国是纸老虎！
    美国的软弱植根于世界资本主义的日益趋于没落，特别是美国资本主义经济的岌岌可危的局势。美帝国主义经济的崩溃，是历史已经写定的命运。
    美国经济的崩溃，由于美国的经济危机，我们应该研究、熟悉敌人这一致命的弱点。
    这里介绍的五本书，首先值得提出的是美共领袖福斯特、艾伦等写作的《经济危机与冷战》一书，这是美国马克思主义经济学者集体研究的结晶。其次是美国进步的“劳工研究协会”编的《美国资本主义的趋势》（该书除五十年代出版社译本外，世界知识社也有一个译本），这本书不是专门讨论危机问题的，而是根据了马克思主义政治经济学的主要纲目，完整地研究美国经济的一本好书。再次是于怀根据Fritz Sternberg的原作编译的《正在到来的美国恐慌》，这本书比较旧，没有最近两年来的新材料，而且如编译者所指出的，其中某些观点，“如果以严正的马列主义学说来衡量，是颇有商榷余地的。”例如，作者片面化了马克思说的压迫别人的民族本身没有自由这个论点，对于一九二九年以前的帝国主义强国，作了“帝国主义缓和了国内矛盾”的论断（第三章）。但作者对于目前经济危机的某些特征（第四章和第五章），则是作了较深入的研究的。
    以上这三本书，都不能算是通俗著作，蒋学模著的《美国经济危机》一书，则是一本比较通俗的读物。陈翰伯写的《朝鲜战争后的国际形势》小册子中，有谈到美国备战经济的一小节，是包括了最新的材料的。
    关于经济危机的原因以及美国经济情势，在《经济危机与冷战》的第一至第三章，《美国资本主义的趋势》第二至第六章，《正在到来的美国危机》的第一章和第五章，《美国经济危机》的第四章中均有叙述。
    美国经济危机的征兆，在一九四七年就已显露了，但正式的序幕是在一九四八年秋季揭开的。这一次美国经济危机的特点，是发展的缓慢性、渐进性，不像一九二九年世界资本主义危机那样以一个短时期间的剧烈的风暴开始。造成这种现象的原因是和美帝国主义对外扩张政策不可分的。军备的扩张，对外的倾销，在美国生产上起了强心针的作用，这种假象的市场消纳力，维持了美国生产的假象繁荣。其次，独占资本及其白宫的奴仆，竭力保持国内垄断的高价，把恐慌的损失转嫁于劳动人民身上，也使金融股票物价市场采取缓慢下降的方式，掩蔽了危机的暴烈性。但是这一切，不过“使得危机对于商品的主要消费者——民众，特别痛苦而更加破产，同时还不能不使危机延长，不能不阻碍危机的消散。”（斯大林在联共十六次代表大会上的报告）。
    资本主义经济危机的原因是生产与消费的矛盾，这已经是普通的常识了。简括地说来，就如下面一段话：“资本主义的主要任务是为那不断增加的商品找到一个有利的市场。资本主义生产的矛盾就表现在它不能解决这一市场问题上。有利的解决，就意味着繁荣；没有解决，就是恐慌。”（《正在到来的美国恐慌》第一章）
    美帝国主义的生产与消费之间的矛盾达到如何程度呢？这里引用一下这几本书中采用的若干数字：美国资本主义生产目前已占世界资本主义全部生产的三分之二（在第二次世界大战前占百分之四十五）。美国工业生产总值，以一九三五至一九三九年的平均数为一○○，战时的一九四三年达到二三九的最高峰，以后因危机的缓慢发展而逐年下跌，战后的一九四六年是一七○，一九四七年是一八六；以一九三七年为一○○，一九四八年十月是一七五，一九四九年十月跌至一三七，但一九四九年全年的水平仍约略等于一九四六年。这里说明了两个事实，即：一方面危机已经发展了，一方面生产力仍然是庞大的。美国资本家的利润则相反，是一直增加的，仅仅以资本家呈报的表面数字看，第二次世界大战前的五个年头平均数，资本家利润每年为三十亿六千万元，战时五年平均每年为八十四亿六千万元，战后的一九四六年因取消物价管制，利润突增至一百二十五亿元，一九四七年续增至一百七十四亿，一九四八年为二百四十六亿，一九四九年估计数约为二百六十五亿，一九五○年据杜鲁门的估计，可能突破三百亿达到三○五亿，即等于战前的十倍。这就是美国的“强大”了，这种“强大”乃是财富偏在的结果，乃是“一家欢笑万家愁”的结果。它愈加“强大”，它的危机就愈加深刻，爬得愈高，跌得愈重，这是必然的道理。
    在另一方面，我们来看看美国市场消费能力的一些数字。美国劳动人民的收入和资本家的收入正相反，是逐年地降低了。“工资的增加，经常落在生产力之后，所以劳动生产力的增大反而造成工人在国民生产中所得部分的减少，因而也就使利润增大。因此，对于工人剥削的加强，也就愈易促进发生萧条的趋势。”（《美国资本主义的趋势》第六章）资本家从每一工人身上剥削到的利润以一九三九年为基数，到一九四七——一九四八年增加了四倍到九倍，而工人的实际工资，一九四八——一九四九年比一九四五年反减少了百分之十五——十六。这里还不包括广大的失业人口。至于失业，仅仅据官方减低了的数字，一九五○年初完全失业工人已近五百万，再加上部分失业工人，总计有一千八百万人。广大的美国劳动人民的收入，不能维持他们最低限度的生活预算。
    这样，美国庞大的生产力是无法从国内找到满足的市场的。国际市场呢，不要忘记，美帝国主义的经济危机乃是世界资本主义总危机的主要一环，“在总危机的推动下面，并且由于美国经济所具有的巨大的世界作用，严重的失业、生产过剩与市场缩小的象征，正在很多资本主义国家中同时出现着。这也就加强了美国经济中的恐慌成份。”（《经济危机与冷战》第一章）
    这就是说，美帝国主义企图以英国、西欧、拉丁美洲人民为鱼肉来解救其经济危机的阴谋，是无法实现的。尽管各国反动派甘心做华尔街驯服的走狗，却决不能把无的市场变成有的市场。
    这里还要指出，生产过剩和消费力不足事实上是资本主义社会经常的潜在现象，社会生产品既然很大一部分归入资本家私囊，广大人民当然无力去消费这部分社会生产品了。在平常时候，资本家可以把这一部分过剩生产品投向生产资料的生产，这是可以暂时不依赖人民消费力而盲目发展的部分。但生产资料生产品，最终要靠消费资料生产部门来购买，而消费资料生产品则依靠广大人民的消费能力。所以当人民消费能力减少到使生产资料生产品也发生过剩时，危机就要剧烈地发展起来。“资本主义生产最深刻的矛盾不在生产消费资料的生产部门，而是在生产生产工具的部门。一种没有广大的扩展着的消费市场为其后盾的投资市场的扩大，只有加深资本主义危机的严厉性。”（《正在到来的美国恐慌》编译者序）目前美国经济的特点，正是不但消费资料生产的下跌，而且是生产资料生产的下跌，换句话说，危机已经普遍于一切部门，过剩的生产品再也无路可走了。
    美帝国主义怎样应付这一危机呢？《经济危机与冷战》一书中福斯特的“杜鲁门的《管理经济》与战争危机”一文有极好的叙述，同书第一章至第三章，《美国资本主义的趋势》第七章，《正在到来的美国恐慌》第四章、第五章和第七章，《美国经济危机》第二章和第四章也均有叙述。
    福斯特指出：美帝国主义害怕这一次严重的经济恐慌将比一九二九年爆发的世界经济总危机更为恶劣，这样的一次恐慌，必然将破坏美帝国主义的侵略野心，并造成颠覆世界资本主义制度的革命后果。解救的唯一办法，就是在世界资本主义范围内实行一次猛烈的普遍的削减或消灭资本家的利润，但这种要鬼变成人的方策，消灭资本主义制度的方策，当然不能为资本主义所能采用的。这样，美帝国主义唯一能够采用的对策，就是凯恩斯之流所倡议、杜鲁门政府所执行的所谓“管理经济”政策。福斯特又指出所谓“管理经济”决不是社会主义的计划经济，在各个私人占有的资本家都力图在竞争中保存和扩大自己的庞大利润，毁灭其竞争敌手的社会制度下，是不可能实行计划的生产与消费的制度的。因此，“管理经济”的实质，就是要以庞大的政府支出来填补市场的空虚和延缓并缩小经济恐慌。而政府支出主要是由人民的赋税来负担的，这就是把危机的损失转嫁到劳动大众身上了。事实很明白，这种政策只是更削弱了人民的购买力，它也许能够延缓危机发生的时间；但更加加重人民的贫困和痛苦，使危机更加深刻化了。
    “管理经济”的政策之一，是由政府大规模兴办各种公共工程以容纳失业人口，采取对外和平政策以争取市场，特别是人民民主国家的庞大市场。这是美国自由主义者所提倡，罗斯福曾经执行的政策，它对危机有一定的减消作用，但也无法根本避免危机。而且这种政策是为大资本家所反对的，因为这种政策必须增加大资本家的赋税负担才能有效的执行。对此，《美国资本主义的趋势》第七章，有很好的叙述。
    另外的一种政策，也就是杜鲁门政府现在所执行的政策，就是疯狂的扩张军备和实行掠夺性的对外贸易。
    尽管资本主义世界市场完全不能吸收美国大量生产，尽管历史上的美国对外输出从来没有超过美国庞大生产品的百分之十（美国市场主要是在国内），美帝国主义却仍然不能不被迫在国外市场上找寻出路。这种出路既不能在正常市场中得到，就不能不是掠夺性的，“势必大部以牺牲其他国家来‘找到’的”（《经济危机与冷战》第一章）。也就是说，这是依靠如下一系列的手段来保证达到目的的：——独占的对外倾销，打破其他资本主义国家的关税壁垒，强制购买美国货物，不准购买其他国家货物，甚至强制别国不准在其国内生产某种生产品。然而这样，又必然要对其他国家资本主义经济的发生进一步的破坏，其最后结果并不是世界市场扩大而是缩小了！
    这种掠夺性的输出是以美国财政支持为条件的，因为只有以不断的财政借款才能诱惑在经济危机中的其他国家的反动派，俯首贴耳地听任美帝国主义的宰割。“在战后最初三年中，出超达到了二百五十六亿美元，其中五分之三都是美国政府以贷款和赠与的方式支持的。美国帝国主义经济状况的困难，就在于因为美国食粮和原料资源的雄厚，使得任何一段时期内，大量出口的价款和海外大量投资的利益，都不能借入口来实现。”（《经济危机与冷战》第一章）所以这种掠夺性的对外输出，归根到底还是依赖美国政府的支出来实现的。
    这种掠夺性输出的最后目的，是归结到美国军事侵略计划上。“资本的输出大部采取政府赠予贷款的形式，而与侵略的外交政策联结在一起。”（《经济危机与冷战》第一章）美帝国主义是企图以世界性的军备扩张来团结其他国家的反动派，准备发动反对苏联和人民民主国家的战争，以求得征服这些国家的人民，扩大资本主义的殖民地市场。
    在国内，“资本家认为战争定货和最后战争本身乃是维持工业所必要”（福斯特文）。但是不论国内的军备扩展也好，国际的军备扩展也好，都不能挽救经济危机的到来，它最多只是用加紧剥削人民的手段获得暂时的喘息罢了。因为不论是军事生产和军饷开支，都是脱出了正常的生产流通范围之外而成为一种绝对的消耗的。军事市场的主顾是政府，不是任何生产单位和人民，一切军事消耗品都不能再投入生产。这种额外的市场当然能刺激生产的一定发展，这种市场又必须继续扩大，才能满足不断累积了的资本扩大的要求。可是，政府的军事开支从哪里来的呢？它必然主要由劳动人民来负担，军备竞赛尽管能减少一部失业者数目，但是使整个劳动人民的收入降低了。所以，军事支出愈大，人民收入愈低，市场就愈益狭小，其结果又必然要导引出恶性通货膨胀来，这是足以毁坏美国整个社会经济生活的。总结一句话，“大量的‘冷战’费用并不能阻止美国国内发展中的生产过剩的危机，是变得愈益明显了。”（《经济危机与冷战》第六章）
    最后谈到资本主义世界经济总危机的问题。美帝国主义最大企图是用侵略战争来挽救它的崩溃命运，这是不是有可能呢？《经济危机与冷战》回答了这个问题：“资本主义总危机的情况，特别是世界力量进一步向社会主义和民主方面的移动，就使得独占资本很难用战争，来找到一条逃出它目前危急情况的出路。”（第一章）这个问题，在《经济危机与冷战》第一章、第二章，《正在到来的美国恐慌》第五章、第六章，《美国经济危机》第五章中，都说到了。资本主义总危机的特点总括起来是：
    一、这个危机是包括了整个资本主义世界的，因此，各个帝国主义国家争夺市场的斗争十分剧烈，不管美帝国主义如何张牙舞爪，帝国主义相互间的矛盾是无法消除的。另一方面，在危机下面的人民大众的觉悟力量正日益奋张起来，越是在危机深刻的地方（例如受到较多战争破坏影响的英国、法国、其他西欧各国、西德、日本），人民觉悟力量就愈大，而且发展得愈快。帝国主义向战争每一步前进，人民生活每一步下降，必然相应地引起人民反抗斗争的不断高扬。
    二、这个危机是工业危机和农业危机结合着的，在资本主义总危机以前的危机中，未开发的农业可以作为工业危机的缓冲，是开辟新市场的对象，但现在农业中的资本主义也同样发展到过剩程度了。在殖民地国家中，封建、半封建的农业制度固然还孕育着充分的市场消纳力，然而美帝国主义既然依赖着这些国家中的封建反动分子，它就自然不能不保存这些国家的封建、半封建制度，而破坏了这些国家农业市场的发展。
    三、全世界八亿以上人口已经摆脱资本主义的世界范围，而站在社会主义的人民阵营中，这就使得资本主义市场范围空前缩减，而这些人民民主国家，特别是苏联，经济建设正在飞速地跃进着，今天，人民力量是空前地壮大了。
    四、在一切殖民地半殖民地国家中，反对帝国主义的民族武装斗争，也正在日益胜利地扩大，并开始建立起人民民主的国家，它将继续缩小资本主义世界的统治。
    因此，帝国主义企图以侵略战争来争取新的市场，是完全不可能的。“美国独占资本统治世界的运动，不能战胜世界上反帝国主义联合力量的增长，也变得更清楚了。”（《经济危机与冷战》第六章）
    我们研读了这几本书之后，可以看出：美帝国主义的经济是资本主义所能达到的最高峰，如马克思的话，它正是资本主义的《最后一言》。通过这次危机，必然将使资本主义世界发生一个根本的下降，也必然将使社会主义的人民的力量发生一个根本的上升，资本主义死亡的前途已经可以看得见了。然而美帝国主义者是不会甘心它的死亡的，它将在绝望中继续挣扎，它将力求冒险发动战争。全世界人民应该更加团结努力，制止帝国主义者的战争准备，以更大的力量压制帝国主义者的战争阴谋。如果敌人悍然发动战争，就坚决的在战争中把它消灭掉。
