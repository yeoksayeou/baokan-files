(Xinhua News Agency, November 23rd Dispatch from New York) A summary of TASS reports: The United Nations General Assembly held plenary sessions from the afternoon of November 17th to the 20th to discuss the item "Twenty-Year Programme for Achieving Peace Through the United Nations" proposed by UN Secretary-General Trygve Lie.

Lie submitted a memorandum regarding this program as the basis for discussion. This memorandum emptily and hypocritically called for peace, but did not propose any effective measures, and also contained recommendations that conspired to reduce the authority of the Security Council in violation of the UN Charter.

Nine countries, including the United States' client states Canada, Chile, and Yugoslavia, put forward a proposal praising Lie's memorandum and suggesting that the various UN agencies review the parts of the memorandum relevant to their respective agencies and submit reports to the Sixth Session of the United Nations General Assembly.

The Soviet delegation put forward a proposal agreeing to raise the issue of formulating a twenty-year program for achieving peace, but suggested that the following six provisions must be included when further formulating this program: (1) The Security Council holds regular meetings, knowing that the Security Council should perform its duties with the full and complete participation of representatives of the People's Republic of China, making its organizational composition complete; (2) The Security Council should adhere to the principle of unanimity among the great powers in its work; (3) Unconditional prohibition of atomic weapons and other types of weapons for mass destruction, and the establishment of controls to supervise the implementation of the above prohibition; (4) During the formulation of the program, agreements stipulating the number and types of troops to be supplied to the Security Council by the permanent members of the Security Council in accordance with Article 43 of the Charter, and the principle of equality in quantity and quality of the troops sent by the permanent members of the Security Council, should be implemented. The above principles may be varied by special decision of the Security Council if a permanent member of the Security Council so wishes; (5) Technical assistance should be given to economically backward countries, even if not entirely through the United Nations, at least in most cases through the United Nations. Moreover, this assistance must be used to develop the domestic resources and national industries and agriculture of backward countries to strengthen their economic independence, and should not be conditional on requiring political, economic, or military privileges for the countries providing such assistance; (6) Develop international trade without discrimination on the basis of equality and respect for the sovereignty of all countries and non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries.

Soviet delegation leader Vyshinsky delivered a speech on the morning of the 18th that received close attention from the audience. Vyshinsky said: The Soviet Union has consistently pursued a policy of peace and promotion of international cooperation and is willing to support all measures that are truly aimed at strengthening and maintaining peace and the security of all countries. Although the General Assembly has rejected the Soviet Union's various proposals, the Soviet Union will never stop fighting to achieve its goals and will contribute all its strength to achieve these goals to the greatest extent in the shortest possible time.

Vyshinsky then described in detail the Soviet delegation's attitude towards Lie's memorandum. Vyshinsky said: We must first say that if such a program ignores tasks such as stopping propaganda for a new war, unconditionally prohibiting atomic weapons and establishing effective international controls, reducing armaments, especially the armaments of major powers, resolving outstanding disputes between major powers, and concluding conventions between major powers to strengthen peace, then this program is empty and meaningless. Without putting effort into completing these tasks, there can be no serious way to formulate any peace program through the United Nations.

Vyshinsky further said: The Soviet government supports the suggestion that the United Nations formulate a twenty-year program for achieving peace. The Soviet government agrees with the memorandum that measures can be successfully taken through the United Nations to stop the so-called Cold War and help strengthen peace. The Soviet government agrees with the memorandum that it is impossible to achieve any mutual progress as long as the issue of China's membership in the United Nations is not resolved. The Soviet government is prepared to support certain recommendations mentioned in the memorandum; such as continuing negotiations on atomic energy on the basis of the resolution adopted by the Fourth Session of the United Nations General Assembly, concluding agreements on limiting and reducing any type of armed forces, etc.

Vyshinsky also pointed out some essential shortcomings and the one-sidedness of Lie's memorandum. For example, it suggests holding regular meetings of the Security Council, but the issue of China's attendance at the Security Council is not mentioned in this part of the memorandum. Vyshinsky also pointed out: Recommendations in the memorandum regarding restricting the use of the principle of unanimity among the permanent members of the Security Council and regarding the principles of controlling atomic energy are unacceptable. Vyshinsky particularly emphasized that Lie's memorandum evaded the issue of banning atomic bombs. After analyzing Lie's memorandum, Vyshinsky said: The memorandum is a mouthpiece for the ruling circles of the United States and the US-British bloc.

Vyshinsky said: The Soviet delegation believes that this memorandum should be revised with reference to the opinions exchanged at the General Assembly. The nine-country proposal is completely unacceptable. Because we believe that the General Assembly must express its opinion on the essence of the issues mentioned in the memorandum and must provide the necessary guidance for further formulating a twenty-year program for achieving peace. The Soviet proposal points out a clear direction for future work on formulating the program. The nine-country proposal did not even want to achieve this goal. In conclusion, Vyshinsky appealed to the delegations that are truly concerned about the United Nations formulating an effective program for achieving peace to support the Soviet proposal.

Representatives from Ukraine and other countries spoke in agreement with the Soviet Union's criticism of Lie's memorandum and supported the Soviet proposal.

Representatives of the US-British bloc countries did their utmost to tout Lie's memorandum in their speeches and demanded the passage of the nine-country proposal. British representative Younger indicated that he would vote against every part of the Soviet proposal, including the part stipulating that representatives of the People's Republic of China participate in Security Council meetings.

The United States manipulated the majority voting machine and brazenly rejected the Soviet proposal at the plenary session on the 20th, while passing the nine-country proposal.

　　联大讨论赖伊备忘录非法通过九国提案
    维辛斯基予以严正批评
    备忘录空洞虚伪呼吁和平未提任何有效办法
    是美英集团的传声筒阴谋违反联合国宪章
    【新华社二十三日讯】综合塔斯社纽约讯：联合国大会全体会议自十一月十七日下午开始讨论联合国秘书长赖伊所提出的《拟订经由联合国谋取和平的二十年方案》案，至二十日结束。
    赖伊提出一个关于这一方案的备忘录，作为讨论的基础。这个备忘录空洞而虚伪地呼吁和平，却并没有提出任何有效的办法，而且还包含有阴谋削减安理会职权的违反联合国宪章的建议。
    美国仆从国家加拿大、智利、南斯拉夫等九国提出提案，赞扬赖伊的备忘录，并建议联合国各机构审议备忘录中与各该机构有关的部分，并向联合国第六届大会提出报告。
    苏联代表团提出提案，同意提出关于拟订谋取和平的二十年方案的问题，但建议在进一步拟订这一方案时，必须列入下列六项规定：（１）安全理事会常会深知安理会应在有中华人民共和国代表参加而使其组织成分充分及完全的情况下执行职务；（２）安理会在其工作中应恪守大国一致原则；（３）无条件禁止原子武器和其他型式用于大规模毁灭的武器，同时建立管制以监督上述禁令的实现；（４）在拟订方案期间，应将规定安理会常任理事国依照宪章第四十三条供给安理会之军队数目和种类的协定，以及安理会常任理事国所派军队在数量与质量上平等的原则付诸实施。在安理会某一常任理事国愿意时，得以安理会的特别决定对上述原则变通办理；（５）对经济落后国家给予技术援助，即使不是完全经过联合国，至少也应在大多数场合经过联合国进行之。而且这种援助必须用以发展落后国家的国内资源和民族工业与农业，以加强其经济独立，而不应该附有条件要求给那些提供这种援助的国家以政治、经济或军事的特权；（６）在平等与尊重各国主权、不干涉其他国家内政的基础上，毫无歧视地发展国际贸易。
    苏联代表团团长维辛斯基在十八日上午发表了一篇受到听众深切注意的演说。维辛斯基说：苏联一贯奉行和平及增进国际合作的政策，愿意支持真正旨在加强并保持和平与各国安全的一切措施。虽然大会否决了苏联的各项建议，但是苏联将决不停止为实现其目的而进行的斗争，并且将贡献全部力量，以便在尽可能短的期间内在最大程度上实现这些目的。
    维辛斯基继而详细地叙述苏联代表团对于赖伊备忘录所持的态度。维辛斯基说：我们首先必须说：假使这样的方案无视这样的一些任务，如制止新战争宣传，无条件地禁止原子武器并建立有效的国际管制，裁减军备特别是裁减大国的军备，解决大国间未决的争端以及大国间为加强和平而缔结公约，那么这个方案就是空洞的，没有任何意义的。不把努力用在完成这些任务上，就不可能有通过联合国制定任何和平方案的认真办法。
    维辛斯基进一步说：苏联政府赞成要联合国制定谋取和平的二十年方案的建议。苏联政府同意备忘录中所说通过联合国可以顺利地采取措施，以停止所谓冷战并有助于加强和平。苏联政府同意备忘录中所说只要中国加入联合国的问题没有解决，要达成任何相互的进展是不可能的。苏联政府准备支持备忘录中谈到的若干建议；譬如在联合国第四届大会所通过的决议的基础上继续关于原子能的谈判，缔结关于节制并裁减任何类型的武装部队的协定等等。
    维辛斯基同时指出赖伊备忘录中若干本质性的缺点和备忘录的片面性。例如它建议召开安理会常会，但在备忘录的这一部分中，中国出席安理会的问题却只字未提。维辛斯基又指出：备忘录中关于限制安理会常任理事国使用大国一致原则、关于管制原子能的原则等建议，都是不能接受的。维辛斯基特别强调指出：赖伊的备忘录规避了禁用原子弹的问题。维辛斯基在分析赖伊备忘录后说：备忘录是美国统治集团和美英集团的传声筒。
    维辛斯基说：苏联代表团认为这个备忘录应该参照大会中所交换的意见加以修正。九国提案是完全不能接受的。因为我们认为，大会必须对备忘录中所提到的问题的本质表示意见，同时必须作必要的指导，以便进一步拟订谋取和平的二十年方案。苏联提案就是为今后拟订方案的工作指出明确方向。而九国提案连想也没有想要达到这种目标。维辛斯基在结语中吁请真正关心联合国拟订谋取和平的有效方案的代表团支持苏联的提案。
    乌克兰等国代表发言同意苏联对赖伊备忘录的批评，支持苏联的提案。
    美英集团国家代表在发言中极力为赖伊备忘录吹嘘，要求通过九国提案。英国代表杨格表示将投票反对苏联提案的每一部分，包括规定由中华人民共和国代表参加安理会会议的一部分。
    美国操纵多数表决机器，在二十日全体会议上悍然否决苏联提案，而通过了九国提案。
