　　Second World Peace Congress Resolution
    Supporting Persecuted Peace Fighters
    [Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, 23rd] TASS, Warsaw, 23rd: The Second World Peace Congress passed the following resolution supporting persecuted peace fighters:
    In many countries, peace fighters are currently subjected to police persecution. In the United States, France, Italy, Latin America, Africa, and many countries in the Near East, tens of thousands of peace fighters have been imprisoned. Among them are many who were elected as delegates to this Congress but could not attend. In many places, gatherings to defend peace have been banned. Police beat peace fighters and open fire on them. Scientists who fight for peace cannot escape various forms of persecution either.
    The Second World Peace Congress pays tribute to these peace fighters and firmly protests against the persecution they are subjected to. The Congress demands the immediate release of all those who have suffered from police terror. The Congress calls on the people of the world to support the noble peace fighters, to give them freedom, and to support and defend all those who fight for world peace.

　　二届世界和大决议
    声援受迫害和平战士
    【新华社二十三日讯】塔斯社华沙二十三日讯：第二届世界保卫和平大会通过声援受迫害的和平战士的决议如下：
    在许多国家里，和平战士们目前正遭到警察的迫害。在美国、法国、意大利、拉丁美洲、非洲和近东的许多国家里，成千成万的和平战士们被关进牢狱。其中有许多人当选了出席本届大会的代表，但不能出席大会。许多地方的保卫和平的集会遭到禁止。警察殴打和平战士并开枪射击他们。为和平而斗争的科学家同样不能逃避种种迫害。
    第二届世界保卫和平大会向这些和平战士们致敬，并坚决抗议对他们进行的迫害。大会要求立即释放所有遭受警察恐怖迫害的人们。大会号召全世界人民声援崇高的和平战士，使他们得到自由，支持并保卫一切为全世界和平而斗争的人们。
