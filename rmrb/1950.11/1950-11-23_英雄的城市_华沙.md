　　Heroic City - Warsaw

　　Warsaw suffered the most severe destruction in World War II, but it has been rebuilt and restored at an astonishing rate.

　　Hitler's gang originally wanted to destroy the city, leaving only a geographical name. After the victorious Soviet army and Polish people's armed forces drove the Hitler gang out of the country, Warsaw was a pile of rubble, indicating that the Hitler gang had achieved its goal of destroying Warsaw. However, the entire Polish people, liberated by the victory of the democratic camp, crushed the evil dream of the fascist beasts with unparalleled enthusiasm and perseverance.

　　During the last war, the number of Warsaw people lost exceeded the number of British and American war deaths during the entire war. In 1939, Warsaw had 25,500 houses; but in January 1945, 11,200 were completely destroyed, 3,800 were mostly destroyed, and more than 10,000 houses had to be repaired before they could be inhabited. In 1939, the building volume of Warsaw was 103 million cubic meters. In 1945, only 26 million cubic meters remained. The population of Warsaw, 1.5 million, was reduced to only 22,000.

　　Warsaw was liberated on January 17, 1945. From that day on, the Polish people who had been exiled and expelled by the Hitler bandits returned one after another, cleared the rubble, and started to rebuild their capital. The People's Polish government decided to make Warsaw the national capital and made every effort to carry out the restoration work.

　　At that time, Warsaw alone had 80 million cubic meters of broken bricks and tiles. The Hitler bandits left 200,000 bomb craters and trenches here. All the bridges on the Vistula River were destroyed. The city had no electricity, no sewers, no running water, and no transportation.

　　Reconstruction was carried out at an astonishing speed. At the end of 1945, the population of Warsaw was 312,000; in 1947, 500,000; and now it has 669,533. In the first four years, 26 million cubic meters of buildings were repaired, and 24 million cubic meters were rebuilt or newly built. By the end of 1949, 160,000 houses had been rebuilt. In the first three years, the speed of reconstruction was: 137 houses built every day, 5.08 kilometers of water pipes, and 3.26 kilometers of sewers. One hundred train carriages of gravel were transported out every day.

　　All the residents of Warsaw used their spare time to participate in clearing rubble and rebuilding the capital. The Soviet Union also gave the Polish people enthusiastic assistance. Soviet engineers leveled the trenches left by the German bandits, built new bridges over the rivers, and the Soviet Union installed radio stations and telephones for Warsaw, and supplied Warsaw with food and hygiene equipment.

　　In order to build Warsaw into a more beautiful capital than it used to be, to make this capital no longer have dark houses and dilapidated suburbs, and to make this capital a new type of socialist city, Polish engineers overcame all difficulties and successfully completed the task of rebuilding the capital.

　　The city's sanitation has been improved. In 1945, the mortality rate per thousand people was 73.5 percent higher than before the war; by 1946, it had dropped by 7 percent, in 1947 by 22 percent, and in 1948 by another 28.5 percent. Living conditions in the city have also been greatly improved. In 1939, a one-room apartment housed an average of 3.8 people, a two-room apartment housed an average of 2.2 people, an average of 1.6 people in a three-room apartment, and 0.9 people in a six-room apartment. In addition, the average area of ​​each room is also larger in larger apartments. By 1947, an average of 3.2 people lived in a one-room apartment and an average of 2 people lived in a two-room apartment. People's Poland tries its best to facilitate small requests when allocating construction funds. In 1939, Warsaw residents had an average of 80 cubic meters of space per person, of which 54 cubic meters were for housing. In 1949, each person had an average of 70 cubic meters, of which 50 cubic meters was for housing.

　　If you think about the severity of the war damage, of course, the reconstruction of Warsaw cannot be completed in just five years. But now the entire Warsaw area has been rebuilt, and buildings with cultural and historical value have been restored. New workers' residential areas have been built. The seven-kilometer-long east-west avenue has been completed. There are still arduous tasks to be completed. By 1955, Warsaw will become the true capital of this great country.

　　According to the six-year plan, Warsaw will build 5.6 million cubic meters of factory buildings, of which 4 million cubic meters will be used for new factories. Warsaw will have one million citizens. The Machakovsky underground railway, 10 kilometers long and 50 meters wide, will be built in the city. New radio stations, cinemas and film studios, as well as the Palace of Culture, municipal offices and 120,000 new houses will be built. Parks and lawns will cover 1,100 hectares. By the completion of the six-year plan, Warsaw will have 130 more nurseries, 66 primary schools, 22 middle schools, and 55 vocational schools than it does now. Universities and colleges will build 500,000 cubic meters of houses and 330,000 cubic meters of student dormitories. Warsaw will have 10,000 hospital beds, twice as many as before the war. In 1939, half of Warsaw's houses had no sewers and 40 percent had no running water. But by 1955, 97 percent of the houses will have running water and 85 percent will have sewers. Warsaw will become the capital of a great socialist country. Residential areas with 1,500 to 2,000 residents will be used as a basic unit of the city, with their own nurseries, hospitals, cooperative shops, etc. A certain number of units constitute a residential area, including 20,000 to 40,000 residents, with their own schools, theaters, cinemas and cultural palaces, etc. Commercial and residential areas will be separated from factory areas so that factory smoke and traffic noise will not affect residential areas.

　　Warsaw, this heroic city, stands up greater and more beautiful from the ruins and rubble destroyed by the enemy. Some say that the reconstruction of Warsaw is a "miracle." This is not a miracle. This is the result of the tenacious work of the people of the whole country under the leadership of the people's government and the working class party. This is a true example of a nation in power developing its potential capabilities.

　　英雄的城市——华沙
    华沙，在第二次世界大战中受到了最严重的破坏，但是她却以惊人的速度重建而且恢复了。
    希特勒匪帮原想毁灭掉这个城市，只留下一个地理上的名词。在胜利的苏军与波兰人民武装将希特勒匪帮驱逐出境之后，华沙是一片瓦砾，说明希特勒匪帮达到了它毁灭华沙的目的。但是，由民主阵营胜利而获得解放的全波兰人民却以无比的热情与毅力把法西斯野兽这一罪恶的梦想粉碎了。
    在上次大战中，华沙人民损失的人数超过整个大战期间英国和美国死于战争的人数。一九三九年华沙有二万五千五百幢房舍；但在一九四五年一月，一万一千二百幢全毁了，三千八百幢大部分毁了，此外一万余幢房舍也须修理后才能居住。一九三九年，华沙市的建筑物体积共一亿零三百万立方公尺。一九四五年时则仅剩下二千六百万立方公尺。华沙的一百五十万人口，仅剩下二万二千人。
    华沙是一九四五年一月十七日解放的。从这一天起，为希特勒匪徒所流放和驱逐的波兰人民陆续回家，清理瓦砾，着手重建他们的首都。人民波兰政府决定以华沙为国家首都，并尽力进行修复工作。
    当时华沙全市单是碎砖烂瓦就有八千万立方公尺。希特勒匪徒在这里所留下的弹坑与战壕就有二十万处，维斯杜拉河上所有的桥梁都被破坏了，全城没有电、没有下水道、没有自来水、也没有交通。
    重建是在惊人的速度下进行的。一九四五年年底，华沙人口为三十一万二千；一九四七年，五十万；现在已有六十六万九千五百三十三人。最初的四年中，修理建筑物达二千六百万立方公尺，重建或新建二千四百万立方公尺。至一九四九年年底，重建房屋十六万幢。在最初三年中，重建的速度是：每天建筑房屋一百三十七幢，水管五点零八公里，下水道三点二六公里。每天均有一百个车厢的碎石运出去。
    全华沙的居民利用工余时间参加了清理瓦砾重建首都的工作。苏联又给予波兰人民热情的援助。苏联工兵平去了德寇所遗留的战壕，在河流上架起新的桥梁，苏联为华沙装置了广播电台和电话，并以食物及卫生设备供给华沙。
    为了要把华沙建筑成比旧时更美丽的首都，要这首都不再有黑暗的房子，不再有破烂的郊区，要这首都成为新型的社会主义城市，波兰的工程师们不顾一切困难，成功地完成了重建首都的任务。
    城市卫生状况已经改进了。一九四五年，每一千人中的死亡率较战前高出百分之七十三点五；到一九四六年降下百分之七，一九四七年降下百分之二十二，一九四八年再降下百分之二十八点五。城市中的生活条件也已大有改进。在一九三九年，一间房的寓所平均住三点八人，二间房的寓所平均住二点二人，这一平均率在三间房的寓所为一点六人，在六间房的寓所为零点九人。此外，在较大的寓所里，每一房间的平均面积也比较大。到一九四七年，一间房的寓所平均居住三点二人，二间房寓所平均居住二人。人民的波兰在分配建筑基金时对于小额请求者尽量予以方便。一九三九年，华沙居民平均每人占有八十立方公尺的空间，其中五十四立方公尺为住房。一九四九年，每人已平均占有七十立方公尺，其中五十立方公尺为住屋。
    如果想一想战争破坏的惨重，当然，华沙的重建工作在短短的五年内是不能完成的。但是现在华沙全区已经重建了，有文化与历史价值的建筑物均已恢复了。新的工人住宅区盖起了。长达七公里的东西大道完成了。还有艰巨的任务需要完成。到一九五五年，华沙将成为这个伟大国家的真正首都。
    根据六年计划，华沙将建筑工厂房屋五百六十万立方公尺，其中四百万立方公尺用于新建的工厂。华沙将有一百万市民。市内将建筑马查科夫斯基地下铁路，长十公里，宽五十公尺。新的无线电台、电影院与电影制片厂，以及文化宫、市政办公厅和十二万座新的房屋均将建筑起来。公园和草地将占地一千一百公顷。到六年计划完成时，华沙将较现在增多一百三十个托儿所、六十六所小学、二十二所中学，五十五所职业学校。大学与高等学校将新建五十万立方公尺的房屋和三十三万立方公尺的学生宿舍。华沙将有一万张病床，比战前多一倍。在一九三九年，华沙的房屋没有下水道的居半数，没有自来水的占百分之四十。但至一九五五年，百分之九十七的房屋将有自来水，百分之八十五将有下水道。华沙将成为一个伟大的、社会主义国家的首都。一千五百至两千居民的聚居区将作为市的一个基本单位，有自己的托儿所、医院、合作商店等。一定数目的单位构成一个住宅区，包括二万至四万居民，有自己的学校、剧院、电影院和文化宫等。商业和居民区将与工厂区分开，使工厂的浓烟和交通的骚音不至于影响住宅区。
    华沙，这个英雄的城市，从敌人所破坏的废墟和瓦砾中更伟大、更美丽地站立起来了。有人说，华沙的重建是一个“奇迹”。这并不是什么奇迹。这是由人民的政府、工人阶级的政党所领导的全国人民的坚韧工作的结果。这是掌握政权的一个民族发扬本身潜在能力的真正范例。
