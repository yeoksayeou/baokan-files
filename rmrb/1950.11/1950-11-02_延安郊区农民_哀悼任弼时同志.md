Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, October 31st: Farmers in Zao Yuan, Yangjialing, Gongjiagou, Da Bian Gou and other villages in the suburbs of Yan'an were deeply saddened upon hearing the unfortunate news of the passing of Comrade Ren Bishi, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee. On the morning of October 30th, more than seventy farmer representatives, holding incense and memorial tablets, gathered with heavy hearts at the Zao Yuan Auditorium to hold a memorial service. Before the meeting, some representatives faced the east at the entrance of the auditorium, gazing at the spirit of Comrade Ren Bishi, lighting incense and memorial tablets to mourn him; some representatives stared blankly at the portrait of Comrade Ren Bishi in front of the incense-filled altar; some sorrowfully talked about Comrade Ren Bishi's care for them when he was in Zao Yuan. Farmer Zhao Zhanjin said: Our whole family firmly remembers Comrade Ren Bishi. My home was built with his help. Some representatives sighed and said: When the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China lived here, Comrade Ren Bishi was the Secretary-General. His care for us is truly endless. Whoever had difficulties, he would solve them; whoever was sick, as soon as he was told, he would send a doctor to see them, day or night. Especially in the summer of 1943, he led many cadres to help us with weeding and helped us calculate the details of living a good life. We never dreamed that he would pass away, it is truly a great loss for the people. The memorial service began at 2:00 PM. After offering incense and wreaths, Hu Qilin, Secretary of the Yan'an County Party Committee, spoke about Comrade Ren Bishi's life. Farmer representatives Guo Wanhua and three others recalled with sorrow Comrade Ren Bishi's kind concern for them when he was in Zao Yuan. They expressed their determination to comfort his spirit with practical actions to improve production and protest against American planes strafing our territory. At the meeting, everyone approved a telegram to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to express condolences for Comrade Ren Bishi. The telegram stated: Comrade Ren Bishi made great contributions to leading the construction cause of the border region. In particular, he personally led us in production in 1943 and was always concerned about the lives of the peasants. But unfortunately he passed away, which is a great loss to the Chinese people. His merits are with the people, and he is glorious even in death. We send this telegram to express our condolences.

　　延安郊区农民
    哀悼任弼时同志
    【新华社延安三十一日电】延安郊区枣园、杨家岭、供家沟、大?沟等村农民听到中共中央政治局委员、中央书记处书记任弼时同志病故的不幸消息后，万分悲痛。在十月三十日上午，七十多个农民代表，拿着香表，怀着沉痛的心，在枣园礼堂举行了追悼会。会前有的代表在礼堂门前向着东方望着任弼时同志的英灵，点上香表沉痛哀悼；有的代表在香烟缭绕的灵台前呆呆的看着任弼时同志的遗像；有的哀痛地谈论着任弼时同志在枣园时对他们的关怀。农民赵占金说：我们全家都牢牢地记着任弼时同志。我的家是他帮助建立起来的。有的代表叹息着说：中共中央在这里住时，任弼时同志是任秘书长。他对我们的照顾真是说不完。谁有困难，找他就解决了；谁家有病，对他一说，不论白天黑夜，就派医生来看。尤其是一九四三年的夏天，他带领许多干部帮助我们锄草，帮助我们算着过好生活的细账。我们梦想也想不到他会病故，真是人民的大损失。下午二时，追悼会开始。在上香、献花圈后，延安县委书记胡起林讲了任弼时同志的生平。农民代表郭万华等四人，以悲痛的心情回念了任弼时同志在枣园时对他们的亲切关怀。他们表示要以搞好生产的实际行动，抗议美机扫射我国领土，来安慰英灵。会上大家通过给中共中央委员会的吊唁任弼时同志的电报。电中说：任弼时同志领导边区建设事业，贡献极大。特别是一九四三年亲自领导我们生产，时刻关心农民的生活。但不幸病故，实为中国人民一大损失。功在人民，虽死犹荣。特电致唁。
