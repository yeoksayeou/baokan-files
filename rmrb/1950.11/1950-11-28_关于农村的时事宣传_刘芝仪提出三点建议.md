Concerning Current Affairs Propaganda in Rural Areas - Liu Zhiyi Presents Three Points

    To the Editor:
    For work, I went to Baonanwa Village in Pucheng County the day before yesterday. As soon as I entered the village, I was surrounded by a large group of farmers. They were all asking about the Korean War. Many people were very unclear about it. Some were even afraid of being drafted into “expeditionary forces” like in the Kuomintang era. After I explained the concept of resisting America and aiding Korea, the relationship of lips and teeth, and the American imperialists' ambition for aggression, a farmer named Zhang said: “So the American imperialists are invading our neighbors. In the countryside, if a neighbor is in trouble, everyone helps. That’s the right thing to do. It's a pity that I am already sixty years old and cannot walk. If I were younger, I would definitely ask to go and fight that enemy who is invading our neighbors—the American devils.” A young man said: “If this comrade hadn’t said it, we wouldn’t even know where Korea is! Since they are our neighbors and friends, we must help them. We must work harder to produce and support them.”
    Based on the above situation, I would like to put forward the following suggestions for your reference.
    1. Although many rural areas have set up blackboards for news, it is still not widespread enough; and in some places, the content of the blackboards is not updated for many days. Generally, cadres do not pay much attention to international news, so the folks know very little about international affairs. Therefore, I suggest that all villages set up blackboards, and I hope you can provide materials; otherwise, even if many are set up, it would be futile if the content is not substantial.
    2. Currently, it is winter, and the folks like to bask in the sun in the early morning, gathering in groups of three or five to chat. Bad elements often take this opportunity to spread rumors and cause trouble. Therefore, I suggest that our cadres seize this opportunity to read the newspaper to the masses, publicize current affairs, and explain the various policies of the People's Government.
    3. Most villages have already started winter schools. I suggest that the current focus should be on current affairs propaganda about resisting America, aiding Korea, and defending the country, in order to establish the masses' internationalist ideology and patriotic spirit, and to dispel their ideological concerns.

　　关于农村的时事宣传  刘芝仪提出三点建议
    编辑同志：
    为了工作，前天我到了蒲城县保南洼村。刚一进村，就围上来一大群农民。他们都是问关于朝鲜战争的问题。很多人对此非常模糊。有的还恐怕将来抽“出国兵”，像国民党时候一样。等我将抗美援朝、唇亡齿寒和美帝侵略野心讲了以后，一位姓张的农民说：“原来美帝侵略咱们的邻家，比方乡下吧，邻家有事，大家都去帮忙，那才是对的。可惜我已六十岁走不动了，如果年轻的话，我一定要请求去打那侵略我们邻家的敌人——美国鬼子。”一位年青的小伙子说：“要不是这位同志说，咱们还不知道朝鲜在那里哩！既是咱们的邻家、朋友，我们就要援助他。咱们更要加劲生产，支援他们。”
    根据以上情况，我提出以下的几个意见，供你们参考。
    一、虽然有很多农村已办了黑板报，但仍不够普遍；而且有些地方的黑板报，很多日子不换内容。一般干部对国际新闻也多不注意，所以老乡们知道的国际消息很少。因此我建议各村都办黑板报，并希望你们能供给材料；否则办的虽多，内容不充实也是枉然。
    二、现值冬季，老乡们清早起来都喜欢晒晒太阳，三个一堆，五个一堆的说闲话。坏分子也就往往钻这个空子造谣生事。因此我建议我们的干部要抓住这个机会给群众读报，宣传时事，和解释人民政府的各项政策。
    三、各地乡村大部分已开办了冬学，我建议目前应以抗美援朝保家卫国的时事宣传为主，以树立群众的国际主义思想与爱国主义精神，并打破其思想顾虑。
