Xinhua News Agency, 13th. The nationwide flood control work has come to a successful conclusion since the broad masses of people in the Yellow River basin overcame the final threat of flooding at the end of October. Flood control organizations of various rivers have successively withdrawn, and most areas have shifted to winter water conservancy construction and preparations for winter construction.

This year, among the major rivers in the country, the Pearl River basin passed the flood season earliest, and the Yellow River the latest. Except for the Huai River basin, which suffered relatively serious flooding, other areas also experienced local disasters, but they were greatly reduced compared to last year. The Dongjiang, Xijiang, Beijiang, and Hanjiang tributaries of the Pearl River basin experienced two to six floods from the end of April to August this year, most of which exceeded the danger level. The water level of each river began to drop in late August. The main stream of the Yangtze River began to rise in early July. Shashi exceeded the highest water level in previous years. Thanks to the vigorous rescue efforts of the people along the river, no danger occurred. The flood season ended in mid-October. The water level of the Han River rose sharply twice this year. The water level of the Baihe River in the upper reaches rose to 183.01 meters in late October and began to fall on October 27. This year, the Subei Canal was flooded by the Huai River, and the flood control work became tense from the beginning of August. About 300,000 people and commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army in ten counties along the river were involved in the intense work of rescuing and protecting the embankments, and finally, no danger occurred. The Yongding River in North China rose seven times since July, and the maximum flow at Lugou Bridge reached 2,700 cubic meters per second, exceeding the maximum flow of last year by one to five times. The Daqing River, which guards the central Hebei Plain, was also submerged by floods for thousands of miles. Through the efforts of more than 300,000 people and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army along the river, both rivers safely passed the flood season. This year, the water levels of rivers in Northeast China and Inner Mongolia all exceeded the highest flood levels of last year, but except for a few areas where breaches occurred, the rest passed safely. The summer flood in the Yellow River basin was relatively small this year. The water level of the Yellow River rose sharply on October 20, especially in the middle and lower reaches. On the 24th, the flow at Gaocun, Dongming in the lower reaches, reached 7,500 cubic meters per second. Because the Yellow River flood last year was particularly large, the riverbed was silted up. The Yellow River flood in the Shou Zhang section of Pingyuan Province exceeded the embankment by 5 to 8 decimeters. After the people along the river reinforced the dikes and strengthened the dangerous sections, no danger occurred. The flood control organization of the entire river was successfully withdrawn on October 31.

The victory of the nationwide flood control work this year is an important factor in ensuring a bumper harvest of agricultural products this year. The reason for obtaining such achievements is, first of all, that the embankments of the main rivers this year have undergone large-scale flood control projects with emphasis last winter and this spring. Before the arrival of the summer flood season, the flood control organizations of the rivers repeatedly checked and eliminated the hidden dangers on the embankment lines, making the embankments of the rivers universally strengthened. Secondly, the leadership of this year's flood control work was carried out under the unified leadership of the flood control headquarters jointly formed by the Party, government, and military in various places, and with the mutual cooperation and support of the upstream and downstream and the left and right banks. Flood control organizations have been established at all levels from the central to the local counties, districts, and townships throughout the country. For example, in addition to the overall flood control headquarters jointly formed by the relevant provinces in the Yellow River, 303 flood control headquarters were also established in various provinces, prefectures, and counties, and 360,000 people along the river formed a rescue team; the Subei Canal flood control and rescue team also had 300,000 people; and the Yongding River and Daqing River flood control teams in Hebei also had more than 300,000 people. Under the leadership of Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members in various places, these flood control teams demonstrated unparalleled heroism in repeated rescue operations. At the same time, the widespread establishment of flood reporting stations in the main rivers this year is also an important factor in promoting the victory of flood control this year. There were a total of 386 flood reporting stations in the country this year, of which 78 reported directly to the Central Committee. Therefore, leadership organs at all levels were able to accurately and timely grasp the water conditions of the rivers and calmly arrange for prevention. The personal leadership of leaders at all levels and the efforts of the broad masses of people and commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army are the important keys to overcoming this year's floods. Fu Zuoyi, Minister of Water Resources of the Central People's Government, went to the Yellow River to inspect the embankments; Li Baohua, Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Water Resources of the Central Committee, rushed to the dangerous embankment sections several times during the tense period of flood control in the Yongding River; Xiao Wangdong, Secretary of the Subei District Committee of the Communist Party of China, and Hui Yuyu, Director of the Subei People's Administrative Office, personally directed the flood control work on the canal embankment; Yang Xiufeng, Chairman of the Hebei Provincial People's Government, went out four times to inspect the embankments of various rivers in Hebei. Such a strong leadership force and the enthusiastic participation of millions of people and more than 100,000 commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army in flood control work are unprecedented in our country's history. This is the basic reason that determines that our people can overcome this year's floods.

　　全国各地防汛工作胜利结束
    除淮河流域外各地水灾较去年大为减轻是保障今年全国农产品丰收的重要因素
    【新华社十三日讯】自十月底黄河流域广大人民战胜了最后一次洪水威胁之后，今年全国防汛工作已告胜利结束。各河防汛组织已先后撤防，大部地区已转入水利冬修及冬修准备工作。
    今年全国各主要河流中，珠江流域度过汛期最早，黄河最迟。各河除淮河流域发生较严重的水灾外，其他地区虽亦有局部灾害，但已比较去年大为减轻。珠江支流的东、西、北江及韩江流域今年四月底到八月曾先后涨水二至六次，大部均曾超过危险水位，至八月下旬各江水位开始下降。长江干流七月初开始涨水，沙市曾超过历年最高水位，经沿江人民大力抢护未曾出险，至十月中旬度过汛期。汉水水位今年曾两度陡涨，十月下旬上游白河水位曾涨至一八三点零一公尺，至十月二十七日起下降。苏北运河今年因受淮河洪水灌注，于八月初起防汛工作即呈紧张情势，沿河十县约有三十万人民和人民解放军指战员投入了紧张的抢护堤防工作，终于没有出险。华北永定河自七月以后曾上涨七次，芦沟桥最大流量曾达二千七百秒公方，超过去年的最大流量一至五倍。卫护冀中平原的大清河千里堤也曾遭洪水没顶，经沿河三十多万人民和人民解放军战士的努力抢护，两河均安度汛期。东北及内蒙各河今年涨水都曾超过去年最高洪水位，但除少数地区发生漫决外，余均安全度过。黄河流域今年夏汛较小，十月二十日起黄河水位一度陡涨，中下游尤其紧张，二十四日下游东明高村流量曾达七千五百秒公方。因去年黄河洪水特大，河床被淤高，平原省寿张段黄河洪水曾超出堤岸五至八公寸，经沿河人民抢修子埝，加强险工后未出险，全河防汛组织已于十月三十一日胜利撤防。
    今年全国防汛工作的胜利是保障今年全国农产丰收的重要因素。获得这样成绩的原因，首先是今年各主要河流的堤防在去冬及今春均曾有重点地进行了大规模的防洪工程，夏季汛期到来前，各河防汛组织又数次地检查和消灭了堤线上的隐患，使各河堤防普遍增强。其次，今年防汛工作的领导是在各地党、政、军联合组成的防汛指挥部统一领导，和上下游左右岸互相配合支援下进行的。全国各地自中央到地方县、区、乡均成立了防汛组织。如黄河除由有关省份合组防汛总指挥部外，还成立了各省、专区及县防汛指挥部三百零三处，沿河并有三十六万人民组成抢险队；苏北运河防汛抢险队员亦有三十万；河北永定河、大清河防汛队员也有三十多万。这些防汛队伍在各地共产党员、青年团员的带头领导下，在屡次的抢险中都表现出无比的英勇。同时，今年各主要河流普遍设立报汛站，也是促成今年防汛胜利的重要因素之一。今年全国各河共有报汛站三百八十六处，直接向中央报汛的有七十八处。因此使各级领导机关得以准确、及时地掌握各河水情，从容布置防范。各级首长的亲自领导和广大人民及人民解放军指战员的努力奋斗则是战胜今年洪水的重要关键。中央人民政府水利部傅作义部长曾赴黄河检查堤防；永定河防汛紧张期间中央水利部李葆华副部长曾数次赶赴险工堤段督守；中国共产党苏北区党委书记萧望东、苏北人民行署主任惠浴宇等曾亲往指挥运堤防汛工作；河北省人民政府杨秀峰主席曾四次出动检查河北各河堤防。这样坚强的领导力量和数百万人民与十多万人民解放军指战员的热烈参加防汛工作，在我国历史上还是空前的，这是决定我全国人民能够战胜今年洪水的基本原因。
