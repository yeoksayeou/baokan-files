Xinhua News Agency, 26th: Foreign Minister Zhou Cables UN Secretary-General
    I Have Sent a Representative to Attend the Political Committee
    To Discuss the Case of Accusing the United States of Aggression Against China
    Political Committee Decides to Begin Discussion Today
    [Xinhua News Agency, 26th] UN Secretary-General Trygve Lie cabled our Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai on November 24, notifying the Political and Security Committee of the UN General Assembly that it had passed a resolution at its 406th meeting, inviting representatives of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China to attend the meetings of the Political and Security Committee in order to participate in the discussion of the case of "the Soviet Socialist Republics' accusation against the United States of America of aggression against China."
    Our Minister Zhou Enlai cabled Lie on November 26, informing him that our Central People's Government has appointed Wu Xiuquan, Special Representative to the Security Council, and Qiao Guanhua, Advisor, and other assistants to also serve as representatives, advisors, and assistants to attend the meetings of the Political and Security Committee to participate in the discussion of the case of accusing the United States of America of aggression against China.
    [This newspaper] According to Xinhua News Agency, TASS, New York, 26th: After the Political Committee of the UN General Assembly passed the Soviet proposal at its afternoon meeting on November 24 to invite representatives of the People's Republic of China to attend the Political Committee meeting to participate in the discussion of the case of accusing the United States of aggression against China, the Chairman of the Political Committee attempted to immediately begin the general debate on the "Soviet Union's accusation against the United States of aggression against China." The U.S. representative also attempted to play tricks, wanting to make the resolution passed by the Political Committee regarding the invitation of representatives from the People's Republic of China ineffective, still saying there was no need to wait for the arrival of representatives from the People's Republic of China to discuss this agenda item. The Soviet representative Malik insisted that the discussion must be postponed in order to wait for the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China to respond to the decision that had been passed to invite representatives of the government to participate in the discussion of this agenda item. He also proposed that the Chairman of the Political Committee notify the UN Secretary-General to notify the government of the People's Republic of China of the passed decision regarding the invitation. Later, the Cuban representative suggested postponing the general discussion to November 27, which was supported by the representatives of the Netherlands, Norway, and Egypt. Dulles stubbornly opposed it, initially saying that the U.S. delegation wanted to immediately hear the accusations against the U.S. government, and later using his personal reason that he had to leave New York on November 27 as the main argument. Malik firmly condemned Dulles' unreasonable remarks and asked the Political Committee to pay attention to the contradiction and unseriousness of the reasons and motives put forward by the U.S. delegation regarding the request to immediately begin the general discussion. Malik supported the Cuban delegation's proposal to postpone the general discussion to November 27.
    The Political Committee passed Cuba's proposal. Therefore, the next meeting of the Political Committee is scheduled to be held on November 27, at which time the general discussion on the "Soviet Union's accusation against the United States of aggression against China" will begin.

　　周外长电复联合国秘书长
    我已派代表出席政委会
    讨论控诉美国侵略中国案
    政委会决定今日开始讨论
    【新华社二十六日讯】联合国秘书长赖伊十一月二十四日电我外交部周恩来部长通知联合国大会政治及安全委员会，已于第四零六次会议通过决议案，邀请中华人民共和国中央人民政府代表出席政治及安全委员会的会议，以便参加“苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟对美利坚合众国侵略中国之控诉”一案的讨论。
    我周恩来部长乃于十一月二十六日电复赖伊，并通知我中央人民政府业已任命出席安全理事会特派代表伍修权、顾问乔冠华及其他助理人员兼任出席政治及安全委员会参加讨论对美利坚合众国侵略中国控诉案之会议的代表、顾问及助理人员。
    【本报讯】据新华社讯，塔斯社纽约二十六日电：联合国大会政治委员会在十一月二十四日下午会议上通过苏联所提邀请中华人民共和国的代表出席政委会会议参加讨论控诉美国侵略中国案的提案后，政委会主席竟企图立即开始进行“苏联控诉美国侵略中国案”的一般辩论。美国代表也企图耍花样，想使政委会通过的关于邀请中华人民共和国代表的决议不发生效用，仍说无需等待中华人民共和国的代表到达就讨论这一议案。苏联代表马立克则坚持必须延期讨论，以便等待中华人民共和国中央人民政府对已通过的邀请该政府代表参加讨论这一议案的决定给予答复。并提议由政委会主席将所通过的关于邀请的决定通知联合国秘书长通知中华人民共和国政府。后来古巴代表建议将一般讨论延期至十一月二十七日举行，受到荷兰、挪威、埃及代表的支持。而杜勒斯仍然顽固地反对，起初说是美国代表团想立即听听对美国政府的控告，后来又以他因私人的理由十一月二十七日不得不离开纽约作为主要论据。马立克坚决斥责杜勒斯的无理发言，并请政治委员会注意美国代表团所提关于要求立即开始一般讨论的理由与动机的矛盾性和不严肃性。马立克支持古巴代表团主张把一般讨论延至十一月二十七日举行的提议。
    政治委员会通过了古巴的提议。因此政治委员会下次会议定于十一月二十七日举行，届时将开始关于“苏联控诉美国侵略中国案”的一般讨论。
