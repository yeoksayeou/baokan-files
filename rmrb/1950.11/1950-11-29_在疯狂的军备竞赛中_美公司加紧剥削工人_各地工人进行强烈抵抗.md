Xinhua News Agency, New York, November 27th (TASS dispatch): The United States' frenzied arms race has led to a sharp increase in exploitation in industrial enterprises and on the railways. According to reports from many American cities, the number of industrial injuries is increasing dramatically due to speed-up systems and a complete disregard for safety measures. The New York Worker's Daily reports that 22,105 railway workers were injured in the United States in a single year.

	Gross violations of even the meager existing labor laws have become commonplace in the United States. However, these violations have increased dramatically recently. Even the United States Department of Labor has had to admit that in September alone, 136 companies in New York and New Jersey were accused of violating laws concerning working hours and wages. It is worth noting that many complaints are not registered locally, and even for those that are registered, no action is usually taken.

	Newspapers report that workers are putting up a tenacious resistance to the factory owners' attacks in General Motors factories in Detroit and steel factories in Baltimore. At the Bethlehem Steel Company's factories, workers are striking to protest appalling working conditions.

　　在疯狂的军备竞赛中
    美公司加紧剥削工人
    各地工人进行强烈抵抗
    【新华社二十八日讯】塔斯社纽约二十七日讯：美国疯狂的军备竞赛，已促使工业企业和铁路方面的剥削变本加厉。据许多美国城市的消息显示，由于赶快制度和完全不顾安全措施的结果，工业中残废的人数大量增加。纽约工人日报报道说，在一年中美国有二万二千一百零五名铁路工人残废了。
    大事违反现有的一点可怜的劳工法的现象，在美国本已司空见惯。但最近这种违反的情事还剧烈增加。甚至美国劳工部也不得不承认：单在九月份，纽约州和新泽西州就有一百三十六家公司的工厂被控违反关于工作日长度和工资等法律的情事。值得提醒的是有许多控诉是没有地方登记的，而且对于登记了的控诉也照例是不采取什么措施的。
    报纸报道说，在底特律的通用汽车公司工厂和在巴尔的摩的钢铁工厂中，工人们正对厂主的进攻进行顽强的抵抗。在伯利恒钢铁公司的工厂中，工人进行罢工，抗议可怕的劳动条件。
