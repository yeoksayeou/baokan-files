Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 7th. The people of all ethnic groups, all people's organizations, local organizations of all democratic parties, and democratic personages in the Northwest region unanimously support the joint declaration issued by all democratic parties on November 4th.

The delegation of various ethnic groups in the Northwest region, who participated in the National Day celebrations and recently returned to Xi'an, unanimously stated that they vow to fight to the end for the sacred task of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea to protect our homes and defend the country through voluntary actions. Anniwar Gakulin, a representative of the Kazak ethnic group in Xinjiang, said: "The joint declaration of the democratic parties fully concentrates the will and demands of the people of all ethnic groups in the country. In order to defend the motherland and strive for world peace, the fierce and greedy war-mongers—Truman and MacArthur—must be given the punishment they deserve. We must give full play to the spirit of internationalism and patriotism, give strong support to our Korean brothers, and smash any shameless conspiracies and barbaric acts of aggression by U.S. imperialism." Meng Quanlu, a representative of the Hui ethnic group in Qinghai, and Ma Pile, a representative of the Hui people in Gansu, both stated: "The joint declaration of the democratic parties is the correct direction for the Chinese people to fight against imperialism." League Leader Linqin Wangjile of the Mongol ethnic group said: "Although I am seventy years old, I have the courage to join every Mongol compatriot who loves the motherland on the battlefield, and vow to fight imperialism to the death to defend the people's motherland." His eighteen-year-old grandson, Jiamuzao, expressed his willingness to learn from the patriotic spirit of Paul Kochakin of the Soviet Union and dedicate his youth and life to supporting this declaration. Representatives of other ethnic groups also expressed their opinions in writing, stating their willingness to take immediate action to fight against U.S. aggression and aid Korea to protect our homes and defend the country.

The democratic parties and mass organizations in Gansu, Shaanxi, Xi'an, Lanzhou, and other provinces and cities issued statements on the 5th, expressing their firm support for the joint declaration of the democratic parties and vowing to implement it through practical actions. The Northwest General Branch of the China Democratic League, the Xi'an Branch, and the preparatory committee of the Xi'an branch of the China National Democratic Construction Association jointly issued a statement saying: "The joint declaration of the national democratic parties represents the will and demands of the people of the whole country and fully demonstrates the unprecedented unity of the democratic parties. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, our democratic parties in the Northwest region are willing to do our best to fight to the end against U.S. aggression and aid Korea and defend the motherland." Many members of the Communist Youth League in Xi'an stated: "We are the loyal sons and daughters of the Chinese people, and we are willing to dedicate our youth to fight for the defense of the motherland."

Shen Junru, Vice Chairman of the China Democratic League and head of the central visiting group newly returned from Qinghai, said: "I fully support this joint declaration, not only because I am a member of the Democratic League, but also because I fully agree with the just demands represented by this joint declaration." Cheng Yanqiu, a delegate of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and a dramatist who came to the Northwest to investigate folk drama, said: "Our drama workers must use all forms of activity to launch the anti-U.S. aggression and aid Korea struggle." Ma Hongbin (Hui), Vice Chairman of the Gansu Provincial People's Government and Director of the Provincial Ethnic Affairs Committee, and Huang Zhengqing (Tibetan), member of the Northwest Military and Political Committee and the Gansu Provincial People's Government, representing the Hui and Tibetan people, resolutely supported this declaration and united with all fraternal ethnic groups across the country to support the just war of the Korean people.
