　　The Xizhuang Village Cooperative in Bo'ai County, Pingyuan Province

　　I. General Situation of the Village and the Process of Establishing the Cooperative

　　Xizhuang Village in Bo'ai County has 727 households, with a population of 2,366, and 2,985 mu of land (including 315 mu of barren waterlogged land), averaging 1.26 mu per person. It has also suffered from frequent natural disasters recently, making life difficult for the masses. In 1949, the village chief, Bi Yuanrang, mobilized the masses to reclaim the waterlogged land, turning 146 mu of it into paddy fields. As a result, the masses urgently requested the reclamation of more waterlogged land this spring, but they were unable to do so due to difficult living conditions. In order to support production, the county people's government, through the county supply and marketing cooperative, provided a portion of interest-free grain to solve the production difficulties of the masses. The county cooperative also seized the opportunity to organize the establishment of the cooperative through the grain loan work. It immediately established a preparatory committee for the village supply and marketing cooperative, deciding that members would receive priority and preferential treatment, such as members repaying one jin of wheat for every 1.45 jin of grain borrowed, while non-members repaying one jin of wheat for every 1.04 jin of grain borrowed. Through this grain loan support, the village opened up 169 mu of paddy fields, establishing the prestige of the supply and marketing cooperative. In this situation, the preparatory committee publicized the policies of the supply and marketing cooperative, convened a mass meeting, explaining that each share was five jin of millet, with equal shares and no dividends. At that time, 671 people voluntarily signed up to join the cooperative. At the members' congress, 34 member representatives were elected, 49 member groups were divided, 9 members of the cooperative affairs committee were elected, 4 directors (concurrently serving as director, deputy director, and accountant) and 3 supervisors were elected. The organizational structure of the supply and marketing cooperative and preliminary internal rules were established, and operations began on July 6.

　　II. Promoting Democracy and Meeting Member Needs to Provide Material Benefits

　　Based on investigation and research, as well as the opinions and requests put forward by the members' congress, a business plan was formulated and rules were established. However, because the share capital was small, it could not meet the needs of the members. Upon the members' request to supply oil, salt, and daily necessities daily, it was stipulated that business hours would be one session per day, and the treatment of internal cadres would be based on a work-point system, with a wage of 2.5 jin per session. Member cards and purchase cards were issued. The cooperative members resolved that each member would be allocated 1.5 jin of edible salt per month, calculated at cost plus handling fees. The internal business was clearly aimed at serving the members, while operations for non-members were conducted to the best of the cooperative's ability. A members' congress was held once a month to summarize operations, publicize accounts, and study the operations for the next month. The cooperative affairs committee was convened once every half-month.

　　The cooperative also combined the autumn harvest production to understand that members needed a large amount of fertilizer, but its own funds were small and could not meet the members' requirements. Therefore, it borrowed 1 million yuan from the county cooperative and bought 6,510 jin of fertilizer powder, 10,894 jin of soybean cake, and 2,984 jin of sesame cake. After buying it back, the members' representatives studied and decided to allocate 60 jin of soybean cake and 30 jin of fertilizer powder to each member, fertilizing a total of 1,134 mu of land. However, some members who were in difficulty did not have fertilizer, so they borrowed 3,800 jin of rice from the county cooperative and bought brinepeter and saltpeter, which was lent to the members, solving the fertilizer problem for 47 mu of land. A total of 20,388 jin of fertilizer was supplied to the members, which was 100 yuan lower per jin than the market price, reducing intermediate exploitation by a total of 2,038,800 yuan. It saved 100 man-days of labor, which, at 3,000 yuan per man-day, amounted to 300,000 yuan. Stimulated by this, non-members clamored to join the cooperative, adding 116 members in one day. Later, 41 more members were added, bringing the total number of members to 828, accounting for more than 35 percent of the village's population.

　　From its establishment on July 6 to September 20, the cooperative supplied its members with 75 iron shovels, 38 hoes, helped members buy 5 cattle, 6,510 jin of fertilizer powder, 10,894 jin of soybean cake, 2,984 jin of sesame cake, 2,885 jin of sea salt (including a small amount supplied to non-members), 336 jin of sesame oil, 72 jin of kerosene, 18 packages of matches, 6 jin of honey, and 20 bottles of Ten Drops of Water. After deducting expenses, there was a net surplus of 1,035 jin of rice. By convening a members' congress and publicizing the accounts, the members were educated, and the connection between the members and the cooperative was strengthened.

　　III. Organizing Member Labor to Develop Sideline Production to Overcome Natural Disasters

　　In order to solve the fuel difficulties of the members and masses during the busy farming season, the county branch often negotiated with the branch to organize village member labor. Sixty-nine carts were organized into five major groups to transport 70 tons of coal, earning 2,438,000 yuan in freight. The village cooperative also led and organized 50 member laborers to open two lime kilns, which could burn 50,000 jin of lime in half a month, earning 20,000 yuan per person. At the members' congress, members suggested that members of the village had brick-making skills, and that if brick kilns were opened, member labor could find a way out. After research and calculation by the cooperative affairs committee and finding a sales outlet, it was planned that a kiln could be fired in 40 days, producing 30,000 bricks, which could take care of 220 man-days of labor. At 7,000 yuan per man-day, members could earn 1.54 million yuan in wages. Sending bricks out could take care of 300 man-days of labor, earning 1.5 million yuan in freight. Transporting 20 tons of coal could earn 600,000 yuan in freight for member labor. In total, making one kiln of bricks could earn 3.64 million yuan for member labor. Subsequently, a members' congress was convened and passed the resolution to open a brick kiln. The brick kiln has now begun production.

　　IV. Several Experiences in Building the Cooperative and Future Opinions

　　(1) Holding good members' congresses and members' representative meetings and promoting democracy. Formulating plans based on the demands of the members, and being able to fully meet their demands, so that they can obtain material benefits and improve the members' awareness of being masters of their own affairs, is the central key to consolidating the cooperative.

　　(2) Clearly distinguishing between members and non-members, stimulating non-members to actively demand to join the cooperative, is the main link in consolidating and developing the organization. At the same time, it can also educate members and improve their awareness. The establishment of the Xizhuang Village Cooperative began by clarifying that its purpose was to serve the members, based on the members' opinions. Therefore, it stimulated non-members to join the cooperative and also improved the members' sense of ownership.

　　(3) Base-level cooperatives with large funds are better for turnover. In order to better meet the needs of the members, it is necessary for Xizhuang Village to add more shares. According to the Xizhuang Village Cooperative's members' shares of 4,140 jin of rice, plus two months of net profit, the total is 5,175 jin of rice. It is not enough to use this fund turnover to meet the complex requirements of the members in the future. A members' congress should be convened according to the demands of the members to discuss increasing shares or developing credit to absorb idle funds to make up for the lack of funds.

　　(4) The production of lime kilns and brick kilns can be carried out by the members participating in the labor to raise shares and implement the labor return system, in the manner of a production cooperative, led by the supply and marketing cooperative, in order to reduce the supply and marketing cooperative's assistance to the brick kiln funds. In this way, more funds can be saved to serve the supply and marketing cooperative members. Otherwise, the members participating in the production may be satisfied, while the members who have not participated in the production will oppose it, which will affect the development and consolidation of the cooperative.

　　平原省博爱县西庄村合作社
    一、全村一般情况及建社之过程
    博爱县西庄村有七二七户，二、三六六人，土地二、九八五亩（内水荒三一五亩），每人平均一·二六亩，近又屡逢灾荒，群众生活困难。一九四九年村长毕元让发动群众开水荒，将一四六亩水荒变为稻田，因此群众今春迫切要求开水荒，但因生活困难无力进行，县人民政府为扶助生产，便通过县供销社贷给无利粮一部，以解决群众之生产困难。县社并抓紧通过贷粮工作组织建社，当即成立村供销社筹备委员会，决定入社者可以得到优先和优待，如社员贷粮一·四五斤还麦一斤，非社员贷粮一·○四斤还麦一斤，经此次贷粮支持该村开稻田一六九亩，树立了供销社的威信、在此情况下，经筹委会宣传了供销社的方针，召开群众大会，说明每股小米五斤平股不分红，当时自报入社的六七一名，并在社员大会上选举社员代表三四人，划分社员小组四九组，选出社务委员九人，理事四人（兼正副主任及会计）监察三人，组织建立供销社机构与社内初步的制度，于七月六日开始经营。
    二、发扬民主、根据社员需要、
    制订业务计划，使社员得到物质实惠
    根据调查研究，及社员大会提出之意见与要求，制订了业务计划，建立制度，但因股金少不能满足社员的要求，经社员提出每日供给油盐及日用品，规定营业时间每日一晌，社内干部待遇为记工制，每晌工资二·五斤，制发社员证及购货证。社员决议每一社员每月配售食盐一·五斤照成本加手续费计算，社内业务明确以服务社员为目的，对非社员的经营则量力而行，每月召开社员大会一次，总结经营公布账目，研究次月的经营，每半月召开社务委员会一次。
    该社又结合三秋生产了解社员需要肥料，数目很大，但本身资金少，不能满足社员要求，故到县社贷款一○○万元，买来肥田粉六、五一○斤，豆饼一○、八九四斤，麻饼二、九八四斤。买回后，经社员代表会研究，决定每社员配售豆饼六○斤，肥田粉三○斤，共施肥土地一、一三四亩。但有一部分有困难的社员没有肥料，又在县社贷米三、八○○斤，买来卤水火硝，贷给社员解决了四七亩地的肥料。共供给了社员肥料二○、三八八斤，每斤较市价低一○○元，共减除中间剥削二、○三八、八○○元。节省人工一○○个，每工以三、○○○元计为三○○、○○○元。经此刺激，非社员纷纷要求入社，一日间即增加了一一六个社员，后又增加了社员四一名，连前共有社员八二八名占全村人口的百分之三五强。
    该社自七月六日成立起至九月二十日止，共供给社员铁铣七五张，锄三八张，帮助社员买牛五头，肥田粉六、五一○斤，豆饼一○、八九四斤，麻饼二、九八四斤，海盐二、八八五斤（内有供给非社员一少部），香油三三六斤，煤油七二斤，火柴一八包，蜂蜜六斤，十滴水二○瓶，除开支净余米一、○三五斤。经召开社员大会，公布账目教育了社员，密切了社员与社的联系。
     三、组织社员劳力，开展副业生产，度过灾荒
    县分社为解决农忙中社员群众的燃料的困难，常与分社交涉，组织村社员劳力，将六九辆小车编为五大组，运煤七○吨，赚脚力二、四三八、○○○元。又由村社领导组织社员劳力五○名，开石灰窑两座，半月可烧石灰五○、○○○斤，每人可挣工资二万元。在开社员大会时，社员提出本村社员有烧砖技术，如开设砖窑，可使社员劳力得到出路。经社务委员研究计算并找到销路，即计划四○天可烧一窑，出砖三○、○○○块，能照顾劳力二二○工，每工以七、○○○元计，社员可得工资一五四万元。往外送砖能照顾劳力三○○工，可挣脚力一五○万元，运煤二○吨，社员劳力可挣脚力六○万元，总共作一窑砖，社员劳力可挣三六四万元。随又召开社员大会通过，开设砖窑一座。现砖窑已开始生产。
     四、在建社中的几点经验与今后的意见
    （一）开好社员大会与社员代表会，发扬民主。根据社员的要求，制订计划，并能充分满足其要求，使之得到物质的实惠，提高社员主人翁的自觉，是巩固社的中心关键。
    （二）划清社员与非社员的界线，刺激非社员的积极要求入社，是巩固与发展组织的主要环节。同时更可以教育社员，提高社员的觉悟。西庄村社建立开始，即根据社员的意见明确了以服务社员为目的，故刺激了非社员的入社，同时也提高了社员主人翁的思想。
    （三）基层社资金大才好周转，为了更好满足社员的需要，西庄村有增添股金的必要，按西庄村社员股金为四、一四○斤米，加上两个月的纯益共为五、一七五斤米，以此资金周转来满足社员今后的复杂要求是不够的。应根据社员的要求召开社员大会，讨论增加，或开展信用吸收游资以弥补资金之不足。
    （四）石灰窑、砖窑的生产可由参加劳动的社员凑集股金，实行劳动返还金的制度，按生产社的方式去作，由供销社来领导，以减少供销社对砖窑资金的扶助。这样可节余更多的资金为供销社员服务，否则恐参加生产的社员满意，而未参加生产的社员则要反对，会影响社的发展与巩固。
