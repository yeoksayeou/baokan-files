Returned students, twenty-three in total, from the United States, namely: Diao Kaizhi, Wang Rongguang, Wang Jitao, Li Depei, Cheng Jiahui, Wu Jihui, Zhou Xigeng, Lang Yizhu, Xu Li, Xu Renji, Chen Dehua, Chen Jianyuan, Zhang Zengnian, Zhang Cunhao, Zhang Yuanyi, Pei Huizhen, Liu Fuyou, Liu Guojie, Dai Yubin, Yan Ruiqing, Luo Shiyu, Wei Xiuzheng, and Gu Maoxiang, recently held a symposium on the current situation in the United States on the 11th in the auditorium of the East China Ministry of Education. Shen Tilan from the East China Ministry of Education and others attended. In his opening remarks, Shen Tilan said: "We extend our warmest welcome to all the students who have overcome numerous obstacles created by American imperialism to return to the motherland. We hope that everyone will study hard to enhance the construction strength of the new China and actively participate in various construction projects to serve the people. Currently, the entire nation is experiencing a surge of enthusiasm for resisting America, aiding Korea, and defending our homes and country. Students can share their true experiences in the United States to correct any existing pro-American or fear-of-America sentiments." Afterward, the participating students spoke one after another.

    Diao Kaizhi:
    Seeing the First Five-Star Red Flag, Everyone Cheered and Wept with Joy
    No matter what despicable and shameless means American imperialism uses, we have finally returned to the motherland. When we saw the first bright five-star red flag on the border of the motherland, everyone cheered wildly. Some students were so excited that tears streamed down their faces. In the past few days, we have been too excited. We see a new atmosphere everywhere. The Pearl River Bridge and the Qiantang River Bridge, which were shamelessly destroyed by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, have been rebuilt majestically across the riverbanks. The construction of the new China is truly too fast. This is something we could not have imagined abroad and something that American imperialism could not have dreamed of.
    In order to respond to the US imperialist’s insane act of aggression against our new China, we, a group of students who have suffered persecution from the US imperialists, will resolutely stand on the construction front, act as small screws, stand at the forefront of the anti-American struggle, and act as soldiers. We must tell the people of the whole country about the American people’s aversion to war. US imperialism is a paper tiger, strong in appearance but weak in reality, without the support of the people, and there is nothing to be afraid of.

    Zhang Zengnian:
    Breaking Through Numerous Threats and Persecution, the American Peace Movement is Surging
    In the United States, the petition movement to defend world peace has been widely launched. The famous singer Paul Robeson often performs everywhere under the surveillance of American special agents for the peace movement. The great scientist Einstein was expelled for proposing that atomic secrets be made public. Progressive American youth are using various methods, such as carnivals, beach parties, social dances, concerts, etc., to encourage the American people to sign the peace declaration. In New York, five young people, one of whom was a World War II veteran, were arrested by the police for posting slogans in a park that read “Defend Peace, Oppose War”; one was sentenced to one year in prison, and the others were sentenced to six months in prison. The American government so brazenly persecutes the people's desire for peace. The youths in Boston responsible for promoting peace signatures asked pedestrians on the street to sign, and the police groundlessly slandered them as "obstructing traffic." When they went to the alleys to solicit signatures from housewives, the police said that they were "obstructing freedom of residence." The American government even shamelessly threatened the people, saying: "Anyone who signs the peace declaration is in danger of losing their job." However, the American people are against war and love peace. When I left the United States, 2.55 million people had solemnly sworn on the peace book: "Oppose war, ban atomic bombs!" This shows that the American people are standing with us. We have enough confidence and enough strength to defeat the aggression of American imperialism.

    Lang Yizhu:
    The American People Do Not Want War and Oppose the Government's Aggression Against Korea
    After the outbreak of the war of aggression against Korea, American newspapers used large headlines to promote the war. At that time, I was studying at Oberlin College. Five Korean youths talked to me about this: “Korea does not distinguish between South Korea and North Korea at all. The Americans insisted on raising a puppet, Syngman Rhee. Syngman Rhee lived in the United States for more than ten years, and his wife is an Austrian with American citizenship. Her breakfast every day is enough for a Korean people’s monthly living expenses. The US imperialists raised such a shameless guy to harm the Korean people. Now they are sending troops to help him attack North Korea, and American newspapers still make completely distorted propaganda.” These Korean youths tried their best to reveal the truth about the war through a church newspaper, but they were immediately unreasonably laid off by the factory.
    When I left the United States, an old lady specially gave me a photo of her only son as a souvenir. She said: "My husband was an air force pilot and died in the last war. Now I only have this one son, and they still want him to be sent to his death. I can’t send my son to the front line. Let the war stop quickly!" This represents the voice of thousands of good American mothers.

    Dai Yubin:
    Police Would Rather Shoot Themselves Than Go to the Front Line as Cannon Fodder
    The day after the news of the US imperialists launching the war of aggression against Korea came out, prices began to rise. The liver sausage that Americans usually eat immediately rose from one dime to one dime and two cents, and there was no sugar sold in the market for several days. An American friend's wife pulled me to accompany her to buy a suitcase, preparing to flee. At that time, there were also several suicide news reports in the newspapers. A young policeman shot himself in the throat with a pistol. Before he died, he said: "I would rather shoot myself than see the war, let alone go to the front line as cannon fodder." These facts vividly reflect the American people's aversion to war.

    Liu Guojie:
    War Harms the American People, Increases the Burden, and Separates Families
    Since the outbreak of the war of aggression against Korea, prices in the United States have generally risen, and workers have continued to demand wage increases. Tens of thousands of primary and secondary school students in New York City gathered to petition the state government for wage increases because teachers' lives were affected by prices. The police came out to interfere and knocked down the bamboo fences outside the state government. This matter was unresolved for several days, and finally the authorities shamelessly said: "This must be the Communist Party agitating behind the scenes."
    Sixty-five percent of the United States' national expenditures are spent on war, and less than 2% is spent on education and health. The tax rate borne by the American people is increasing day by day. People with an annual income of $800 to $2,000 have to increase their burden by 20% to 21% of taxes, and it will increase by 3.4% from October. And capitalists with an annual income of more than $500,000 only need to increase by 10%. What good is war for the American people?
    Many old people see the war and think of the family tragedies of World War II: the husband died, the son came back and the daughter-in-law remarried, or several children were born in the family without a father. They curse Congress every day. Many people ask suspiciously: Korea is such a small country, we have already sent 200,000 of the world's "best" soldiers, why are we still drafting soldiers? I don’t know what these “Far East experts” are doing? We are going to fight this unlucky war! Young people are no longer as interested in military uniforms, boots, and medals as they were in the previous two world wars. The slogans they put forward are: "We want to study, not fight!" and "We want to live, not die."

    Xu Li:
    Where is Freedom of the Press? It is Illegal to Want Peace
    We know that the newspapers, magazines, and broadcasting industries in the United States are controlled by the bosses on Wall Street, and the people do not have freedom of the press. I remember when the war had just broken out, two reporters revealed some soldiers' dissatisfaction with the war from overseas, and as a result, the two reporters were escorted back to the country by MacArthur. From then on, war news was blocked. The American people generally reflect: What is the point of fighting this war? Korea is such a small country, so far away from us, and it doesn't hinder us in any way.
    Progressive American youth are very enthusiastic about opposing war and demanding peace. Often in the evening, there are fifteen or sixteen-year-old girls standing on street corners selling publicity materials with the words: "We don't want our brothers and husbands to die overseas, regardless of the tears of our wives and children." Once, in Los Angeles, two young women argued with the police for signing the peace book. They angrily questioned: "Is it illegal for us to want peace? Don't you sometimes talk about peace? It can be seen that what you are talking about is false peace." The American police arrested her.

    Wang Jitao:
    Big Capitalists Manipulate the Regime, and the American People Have No Democracy
    The US imperialists have always boasted about "democracy and freedom" to the world. In fact, it has never been and is not a truly democratic and free country. The basic spirit of the American constitution is to protect the private property of the big bourgeoisie, and the American regime is manipulated by a few monopoly capitalists. Post-war America is even more frantically and increasingly fascist. For example, the American Veterans Association is a special agent organization manipulated by big capitalists. In July of this year, they held a national conference with the banner of how to kill people, regarding killing people as a game, and they can freely shoot and fire guns in the streets, and even tease women on the road. Not to mention the despicable and shamelessness of the Southern Ku Klux Klan.
    Let’s talk about the “academic freedom” boasted by the United States. A professor at the University of Oregon who published a theory about Lysenko was labeled with a red hat, saying that his "thinking is unsound." Many scientific groups united to oppose it, but it was useless. Students in the economics department of the University of Michigan requested that a course on Capital be offered. The school's reply was: "It is not that we do not respect academic freedom, but that Capital is useless to us." This is the democracy and freedom of the American way of life.

    Li Depei:
    Forced to Sign the "Loyalty Declaration," This is the So-Called "Freedom and Democracy"
    The United States, which claims to be free and democratic, has no real democracy or freedom at all. When I was in New York, three teachers were immediately accused by the American government of being "Communists" for writing "We want peace" on the wall. Acheson even shamelessly clamored: "The peace declaration is a conspiracy and propaganda of the Soviet Union and the Communist Party." Many professors were forced to sign the "Loyalty Declaration" to ensure that they were not Communists. At the University of California, 157 professors were dismissed for refusing to take the "Loyalty Oath." If someone arbitrarily persecutes you and says that you are a Communist, you must provide evidence that you are not a Communist, otherwise you are a Communist. This is a legal basis that cannot be found in any democratic country.

    Zhou Xigeng:
    Looking at the Corruption of American Politics from the Example of the Mayor of New York City
    The corruption in American politics is no less than that of the Kuomintang government in the reactionary era. When New York City Mayor O'Dwyer was in office, a light bulb was billed for 50 yuan, and a house worth 200,000 US dollars was billed for 5 million yuan. The New York City government strictly prohibits gambling houses on the one hand, and requires large and small gambling houses to pay 500 yuan to the patrol police every day. Next to the police station is an insurance company that manipulates the private prostitution business on the entire west coast of the Pacific Ocean. Many good women jumped into the fire pit under their protection and coercion. When the old and dim-witted O'Dwyer was accused by citizens and could not stand his ground, he was immediately transferred to the post of ambassador to Mexico. This accusation case was left unresolved.

    Wu Jihui:
    The Truth About American Economic Prosperity: The Poor Starve to Death While Foreign Potatoes Rot
    In Shanghai, there are still many people who think that the United States is an economically prosperous country. In fact, the American economy is completely controlled by the eight major monopoly capitalists such as Morgan, DuPont, and Mellon. Morgan alone owns 26% of American railways, and he also controls two-thirds of the country's steel production. The DuPont family has 500 cars, but many unemployed workers are starving there. Recently, in order not to let the price of foreign potatoes fall, these blood-sucking capitalists would rather buy them in large quantities and let them rot, watching the poor starve to death, or drive them to the front line to be cannon fodder for the capitalists. This is the truth about American economic prosperity.

    Xu Li:
    Who is Afraid of the Atomic Bomb? Americans Have Become Neurotic
    In the past, American newspapers made a big fuss about the power of the atomic bomb. Since the announcement that the Soviet Union had an atomic bomb, newspapers have published articles every day on how to defend against atomic bombs, and even propaganda advertisements are posted on telephone poles. American merchants want to take the opportunity to make a fortune and publicize: "If an atomic bomb comes, just wear a white dress." Another funny propaganda is: "If you don't have white cloth, you can also put a white newspaper on your head." The American people are trapped in a neurotic state of fear by these propaganda.

    Gu Maoxiang:
    Looking for Materials Everywhere to Defend Against Atomic Bombs
    The average American is really extremely afraid of atomic bombs, which is due to the fact that the American government has promoted the effects of atomic bombs every day in the past. Once, 800 tons of explosives exploded in a small city opposite New York, and residents all over the city shouted: "The atomic bomb is coming! The atomic bomb is coming!" Even New Yorkers were in a state of panic.
    In order to prevent atomic bombs, the Governor of California specifically wrote to Congress to find a defense plan, but none of the 38 documents introduced were relevant, causing people's criticism. New York has now organized an atomic bomb defense committee, and it is said that it is going to the United Kingdom to find materials.

    Zhang Yuanyi:
    The US Government's Conspiracy and Evil Plan Deliberately Create a Terrorist Atmosphere
    American newspapers have recently concentrated their firepower on promoting defense against atomic bombs, and even government officials are scared to death. A senator has moved his home to the countryside 60 miles outside of Boston. He said: "The power of the atomic bomb is only 50 miles, and now I live 60 miles away from the city, which is absolutely safe." (Editor's note: The actual power of the atomic bomb is only 5 square kilometers. The US government exaggerates its propaganda, causing this senator to be frightened.)
    Once the lights in the school suddenly went out, and there was immediate chaos: "Oh no, the atomic bomb is coming." This is the effect of Truman's propaganda of the atomic bomb, and it is also an evil plan of the American government to deliberately create this kind of terrorist atmosphere, so that everyone opposes the Soviet Union and participates in the war of aggression. Because they also know that determining the victory of the war does not depend solely on weapons, but more importantly, the human power to control weapons. However, progressive American youth will not use their power to be the killing tools of capitalists.
    When I was about to leave the United States, an American student said to me: "I am happy for you, you can immediately return to free China." At that time, I asked him with concern: "What are you going to do? You have already been drafted." He immediately firmly stated: "Please rest assured, if the American government goes to fight Taiwan, I will never participate in the war. I would rather die than be a capitalist's lackey. I will stay here and wait for public trial. I will give a speech in court about the crimes of war mongers!"

    Diao Kaizhi:
    Cut Off Fingers with Own Hands in Order to Avoid Military Service
    American youth are trying their best to avoid military service. Since the outbreak of the war of aggression against Korea, the marriage rate in the United States has been amazing. Some young people get married after only knowing a girlfriend for two days, because the military service law stipulates that those with families can be temporarily deferred. It is said that recently the military service law also stipulates that newlyweds without children have to be drafted like single men, which has led to many bizarre stories. A college student bought an old car and circled through forty-eight states in order to avoid military service, because if he lived in one place for more than fifteen days, the state government would list him as a draft target, so he had to live a traveling life for a long time. Many American students are frowning all day long, and even have trouble sleeping. The only topic of conversation when everyone meets is, "Have you received an invitation from the military?" Some young people even cut off their own fingers with their own hands in order to avoid conscription.

    Wang Rongguang:
    The US Imperialists Made Various Restrictions to Obstruct Our Return to the Motherland
    Now I want to talk about the various oppressions we international students have suffered in the United States. I started to go through the formalities for returning to China at the end of last year, and I recently managed to get a transit permit to Hong Kong. However, the US government has limited the number of returnees per batch from 125 to 50 and unreasonably stipulates that only those from Guangdong, Guangxi, and Fujian can return home by boat, so I cannot return to Shanghai. I don’t know how much I had to say before I boarded the ship. When I arrived in Hong Kong, British police, instigated by the US imperialists, monitored our actions, not allowing us to go ashore, and even not allowing us to talk to people on the shore. How unreasonable!
    Now that I have returned to the motherland, I feel infinitely excited. This excitement is not temporary, but permanent. We must study hard with everyone, express our patriotic enthusiasm with practical actions, and, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, take on the construction work of the new China.

    Zhou Xigeng:
    The US Imperialists Persecute Our International Students, and Special Agents Monitor Their Actions Everywhere
    The students who stayed in the United States, except for a very small number of children of war criminals who are willing to sink into the decadent American way of life, most of the students are eager to embark on the journey back to China. Many students expressed to us: If you go back, hurry up and write to us and tell us what ways there are to return to China immediately!
    The US imperialists are intensifying their oppression of our international students day by day. American special agent organizations are monitoring our actions anytime and anywhere. The Immigration Bureau often arbitrarily asks us to inquire, at least for two hours, sometimes for four hours. In the past, the residence permits for international students were changed once a year, but now they have been changed to half a year. When changing the permit, you must be asked: "Are you a Communist?" and some inexplicable questions. Next to you are often special agents from the FBI who record the students' answers, and sometimes use tape recorders to record them as a basis for future troubles.

    Liu Guojie:
    The Birth of the People's China Means We Have a Responsibility to Return
    When I was about to leave the United States, the Immigration Bureau also asked me: "Do you like the Chiang Kai-shek government or the Mao Zedong government?" I simply told him: "I like the new government and I don't like the old government. In the past, I couldn't stand the corruption of the Chiang Kai-shek government. I couldn't bear the unreasonable oppression of the Chiang Kai-shek government, so I left China. I have tasted enough of their taste in the lives of civil servants under the old government for more than ten years. Now the People's China is born, I want to go back, because I have a responsibility to take on the construction work of the new China."

    Shen Tilan:
    Today, you have reported the various facts of American imperialism's anti-democracy and anti-peace, and also reflected the American people's psychology of opposing war and loving peace. I hope that you students will have the opportunity to widely publicize to the domestic compatriots, and tell the students who stay in the United States more about the domestic situation, and hope that they will return as soon as possible and work together for the construction of the new China!

　　留美归国同学在沪座谈
    美国人民害怕战争害怕原子弹
    【本报讯】据上海解放日报刊载：最近从美国回来的留美同学二十三人：刁开智、王荣光、王积涛、李德沛、成嘉祜、吴继辉、周锡庚、郎一竹、徐里、徐仁吉、陈德华、陈鉴远、张增年、张存浩、张元一、裴惠珍、刘福佑、刘国杰、戴誉斌、颜瑞清、罗世钰、魏修征、顾懋祥，于十一日假华东教育部大礼堂座谈美国近况。华东教育部沈体兰等多人出席。沈体兰在开会词中说：各位同学这次突破美帝国主义的重重留难，回到祖国，我们是无限的热诚欢迎。希望大家为了增强新中国的建设力量，好好学习；努力参加各种建设工作，为人民服务。现在，全国人民正掀起抗美援朝保家卫国的热潮，同学们可以谈谈在美国的真实见闻，纠正某些还存在着亲美或恐美的不正确思想。之后，与会同学纷纷发言。
     刁开智：
     看见第一面五星红旗大家高兴得狂呼流泪
    不管美帝国主义用怎样卑鄙无耻的手段，我们终于回到祖国来了。当我们在祖国边疆上看到第一面五星灿烂的红旗时，大家高兴得狂呼。有的同学激动得流出眼泪。这几天来，我们太兴奋了，到处看见一片新气象，曾经被蒋匪无耻破坏的珠江大桥、钱塘江大桥，都已重新雄伟的横跨在江岸上。新中国建设真太快了，这是我们在国外所不能想像的，更是美帝国主义所梦想不到的。
    为了回答美帝对我们新中国疯狂的侵略行为，我们这群身受美帝迫害的同学，一定坚决的站在建国岗位上，做一个小螺丝钉，站在反美斗争前哨，做一个战士。我们要把美国人民厌战的情形告诉全国人民，美帝是一只外强中干没有人民支持的纸老虎，是没有什么可怕的。
    张增年：
    冲破重重威胁迫害美国和平运动高涨
    在美国，保卫世界和平签名运动，已经普遍地发动起来。名歌唱家保罗·罗伯逊为了和平运动，经常在美国特务监视下，到处演唱。大科学家爱因斯坦因为提出原子秘密公开，被驱逐出境。美国的进步青年是在运用各种方式，比如游艺晚会、沙滩晚会、社交舞会、歌唱会等等，鼓励美国人民在和平宣言书上签名。在纽约，曾经有五个青年，其中一个是二次大战的复员军人，因为在公园里贴写“保卫和平，反对战争”的标语，被警察逮捕；一个被判处一年徒刑，其余被判处六个月徒刑。美国政府就这样无赖的迫害人民要求和平的意志。波士顿负责推动和平签名的青年们在大街上要求行人签名，警察无理诽谤他们“阻碍交通”，他们走到里弄去征求家庭妇女签名，警察又说他们“妨害居住自由”。美国政府更无耻地威胁人民说：“如果谁在和平宣言书上签名，谁就有失业的危险”。但是美国人民是反对战争，爱好和平的，在我离开美国的时候，已经有二百五十五万人在和平书上庄重宣誓：“反对战争，禁止原子弹！”这说明美国人民是和我们站在一起的，我们有足够的信心，和足够的力量打败美帝国主义的侵略。
    郎一竹：
    美国人民不要战争反对政府侵略朝鲜
    侵略朝鲜战争发生以后，美国报纸上用很大的标题宣传战争，那时我正在渥勃伦大学读书。有五个朝鲜青年就和我谈起：“朝鲜根本不分什么南朝鲜、北朝鲜。美国人硬要抬出个傀儡李承晚来。李承晚在美国住过十几年，他的妻子就是一个美国籍的奥国人。她每天的早餐，够一个朝鲜人民一个月的生活费。美帝就抬出这样无耻的家伙来祸害朝鲜人民。现在又出兵帮他向北朝鲜进攻，美国报纸还要做出完全歪曲事实的宣传。”这几个朝鲜青年就想尽种种方法通过一张教会报纸，把战争真像透露出来，但马上他们被厂方无理停工了。
    在我离开美国的时候，一个老太太特地把她的独身子的像片送给我留为纪念。她说：“我的丈夫是一个空军，在上次大战时牺牲了。现在我就只有这一个儿子，他们还要他去送死，我不能把我的儿子送上前线去，战争快些停止吧！”这是代表千千万万善良的美国母亲的声音。
    戴誉斌：
    警察宁愿开枪自杀不到前线去当炮灰
    在美帝发动侵朝战争消息传出的第二天，物价就开始上涨。美国人平常所吃的肝肠，马上从一角涨到一角二分，市场上几天没有糖卖。有个美国朋友的太太，拉着我陪她去买皮箱，预备逃难。当时在报纸上也刊载了几次自杀的新闻，有一个青年警察，用手枪射进自己的喉管。他死前说：“我宁愿自己打死，不要看见战争，更不要到前线去当炮灰。”这些事实，都活生生反映着美国人民厌战的情绪。
    刘国杰：
    战争危害美国人民负担增加妻离子散
    自侵朝战争爆发后，美国物价普遍上涨，工人不断要求加薪，纽约全市中小学生有几万人，为了教师生活受物价影响，集队到州政府去请愿加薪，警察出来干涉，把州政府外面的竹篱都弄塌了。这事情闹了几天不得下台，最后当局就无耻地说：“这一定是共产党在后面掀动的。”
    美国国家的经费百分之六十五都花费在战争上面，只有不足百分之二用在教育卫生方面。美国人民负担的税率却一天天加重。一年收入八百到二千美元的人要增加负担百分之二十到二十一的税，从十月份起又要增加百分之三·四。而一年收入五十万美元以上的资本家，只要增加百分之十。战争对于美国人民有什么好处？
    许多老年人看到战争，就想到二次大战的家庭悲剧：丈夫死了，儿子回来媳妇嫁了，或者家里生了几个没有爸爸的孩子。他们天天在咀咒国会，许多人在怀疑地问：朝鲜这样小的国家，我们已经送去二十万世界上“最优秀”的士兵，为什么还要征兵？不知这些“远东专家”在干什么？要打这倒霉的仗！青年人对于军服、马靴、勋章再没有前两次大战那样有兴趣，他们提出的口号是：“我们要读书，不要打仗！”、“我们要活，不要死。”
    徐里：
    哪儿有新闻自由要和平就是犯法
    我们知道，美国的报纸、杂志、广播事业，都是操纵在华尔街的老板们手里，人民是没有新闻自由的。记得战争刚刚爆发的时候，有两个记者从海外透露了一些士兵对战争不满的情绪，结果这两个记者就被麦克阿瑟押送回国。从此战争新闻被封锁了。美国人民普遍反映：这个仗打得有什么意思，朝鲜这样小的国家，离得我们远远的又没有碍着我们什么。
    美国进步青年对反对战争要求和平的宣传非常热烈，常常在黄昏的时候，有十五、六岁的女孩子，拿着宣传品站在马路拐角的地方兜售，上面写着：“我们不愿自己的兄弟、丈夫死在海外，不顾妻子儿女流泪。”有一次，在洛杉矶有两个青年妇女，为了在和平书上签名，和警察争论起来。她们气愤地责问：“难道我们要和平就犯法吗？你们不是有时候也讲和平吗？可见你们讲的是假和平。”美国警察就把她逮捕了。
    王积涛：
    大资本家操纵政权美国人民没有民主
    美帝一向以“民主自由”夸耀于世界，事实上从来不曾是，现在更不是一个真正民主自由的国家。美国宪法的基本精神，就是保障大资产阶级的私有财产，美国的政权就操纵在少数独占资本家手里。战后的美国，更是疯狂的日益法西斯化。举个例说吧，美国退伍军人协会是大资本家操纵的一个特务组织，今年七月，他们举行了一次全国性会议，标榜的就是怎样杀人，把杀人看成游戏，在街上游行可以自由的打枪、放炮，甚至在马路上调戏女人。南方三Ｋ党的卑鄙无耻更不用说了。
    再说美国标榜的“学术自由”吧，俄尔冈大学一个教授发表了关于李森科的学说，就被加上一顶红帽子，说他“思想不健全”。许多科学团体联名起来反对也没有用。密西根大学经济系学生要求开讲资本论的课程，学校的答复是：“不是不尊重学术自由，而是资本论对我们没有用。”这就是美国生活方式的民主和自由。
    李德沛：
    强迫在“效忠宣言”签名这就是所谓“自由民主”
    号称自由民主的美国，根本没有真正的民主自由。我在纽约的时候，有三个教师因为在墙上写了“我们要和平”，美国政府马上指责他们是“共产党”。艾奇逊更无耻地叫嚣：“和平宣言是苏联和共产党的阴谋和宣传”。许多教授被强迫在“效忠宣言”上签名，保证自己不是共产党。加里福尼大学有一百五十七位教授因为不愿进行“效忠宣誓”而被革职。假使有人随便迫害你，说你是共产党，一定要你提出不是共产党的证据，否则你就是共产党。这是任何民主国家找不出的法律根据。
    周锡庚：
    从纽约市长的一个例子看美国政治上贪污腐化
    美国政治上的贪污腐化，比起反动派时代的国民政府并不逊色。纽约市市长奥特渥在任的时候，一个电灯泡要报账五十元，一幢二十万美金的房子，要开账五百万元。纽约市政府一面严禁赌馆，一面要大小赌馆每天孝敬巡警五百元。在警察局旁边就是保单公司，它操纵整个太平洋西岸的私娼买卖，许多善良妇女都在他们的包庇和逼迫下跳下火炕。当老朽昏庸的奥特渥被市民告发得不能立足的时候，马上被调任驻墨西哥大使。这桩告发案件就这么不了了之。
    吴继辉：
    美国经济繁荣真相穷人饿死洋薯腐烂
    在上海，还有许多人认为美国是经济繁荣的国家。事实上美国的经济完全操纵在摩根、杜邦、梅隆等八大独占资本家手里。摩根一个人就占有美国铁路百分之二十六，同时他还支配全美钢铁生产的三分之二。杜邦一个家庭有五百辆小汽车，许多失业的工人却在那儿挨饿。最近这般吸血资本家为了不使洋薯跌价，宁愿大量收购起来任它腐烂，看着穷人活活饿死，要不然就驱使他们到前线去为资本家当炮灰，这就是美国经济繁荣的真象。
    徐里：
    究竟谁害怕原子弹？美国人变成了神经质
    过去美国报纸上大吹大擂原子弹的威力。自从宣布苏联有了原子弹以后，报纸上又每天刊载着怎样防御原子弹的文字，连电线杆上也贴着宣传广告。美国商人想乘机捞一笔横财，大肆宣传：“假使原子弹来了，只要穿一件白衣服就行了。”还有一个滑稽的宣传是：“如果没有白布，就用一张白报纸顶在头上也可以的。”美国人民就被这些宣传，陷在神经质的恐惧状态里。
    顾懋祥：
    为了防御原子弹到处去找寻材料
    一般美国人对于原子弹真是恐惧极了，这得归功于过去美国政府天天宣传原子弹的效果。有一次，纽约对面一个小城有八百吨炸药爆炸了，全城居民到处狂叫：“原子弹来了！原子弹来了！”连纽约市民也陷在慌乱状态里。
    加里福尼亚州长为了防止原子弹，特别写信到国会里去找防御计划，结果所介绍的三十八个文件，一个也不着边际，引起人民的责难。现在纽约已经组织了防御原子弹委员会，听说要到英国去找材料。

    美国政府阴谋恶计故意造成恐怖气氛
    美国报纸最近集中火力宣传防御原子弹，连政府官员也吓得要命。有一个参议员已经把他的家搬到离波士顿城六十里以外的乡下。他说：“原子弹的威力只有五十里，现在我住在离城六十里的地方，是绝对安全了。”（编者按：原子弹实际的威力仅五平方公里，美国政府夸大宣传，致使这个参议员吓坏了。）
    有一次学校里的电灯突然熄灭了，马上慌乱起来：“不得了，原子弹来了。”这是杜鲁门宣传原子弹的效果，也是美国政府有意造成这种恐怖气氛，使大家反对苏联，参加侵略战争的恶计。因为他们也知道，决定战争胜利，不是单靠武器，更重要的是指挥武器的人力。但是美国进步青年，是不会用他们的力量去做资本家的杀人工具。
    在我要离开美国的时候，一个美国学生对我说：“我为你高兴，你马上可以回到自由的中国去了。”当时我很关心地问他：“你打算怎样？你已经被征调了，”他马上坚决的表示：“请你放心，假使美国政府去打台湾，我绝对不去参战。我宁愿死也不去当资本家走狗，我要留在这儿等待公审，我要在法庭上演讲战争贩子的罪状！”

    为了逃避兵役亲手砍掉手指
    美国青年正想尽方法逃避兵役。侵朝战事发生以后，美国的结婚率大得惊人，有的青年认识一个女朋友只两天就结婚了，因为兵役法规定，有家眷的可以暂时缓役。听说最近兵役法又规定新婚无子女的与独身汉同样要征调，这就发生了许多离奇的故事。有一个大学生为了逃避兵役，买了一部旧汽车在四十八州兜圈子，因为在一个地方居住十五天以上，州政府就列为征兵对象，所以他不得不长期过旅行生活。许多美国学生，整天愁眉苦脸，甚至睡眠也不安宁，大家见面唯一的谈话资料，就是“你有没有接到军部的请帖？”有的青年甚至为了逃避征调，亲手把自己的手指砍掉。

    美帝做出种种限制阻碍我们回祖国来
    现在我要谈谈，我们留学生在美国所遭受的种种压迫。我在去年年底就开始办理回国手续，最近好容易才得到香港的过境许可证。但是美国政府又把每批回国人数从一二五人限制到五十人，并且无理规定要家乡在广东、广西、福建的才能乘船回国，那我就不能回上海来了。不知费了多少口舌，才乘上轮船，到了香港，受美帝唆使的英国警察又监视我们的行动，不许我们登岸，甚至连和岸上的人说话也不允许。真是岂有此理！
    现在回到祖国，感到无限兴奋，这种兴奋不是暂时的，是永久的兴奋。我们一定很好的跟大家学习，用实际行动表现我们爱国的热诚，在毛主席领导下，担负起新中国的建设工作。

    美帝迫害我国留学生到处有特务监视行动
    留在美国的同学，除了极少数战犯子弟，甘愿沉沦在纸醉金迷的美国生活方式之外，大部分同学都急想踏上回国的旅程。许多同学向我们表示：你们回去，赶快给我们来信，告诉我们有什么办法马上回国！
    美帝对于我们留学生的压迫是一天天加紧了。到处都有美国特务组织随时随地监视着我们的行动。移民局常常要任意的叫我们去询问，起码两小时，有时要四小时。过去留学生居留许可证，每年调换一次，现在改成半年，调换许可许时，一定要叫你去询问：“你是不是共产党？”和一些莫明莫妙的问题，旁边常常守着联邦调查局的特务，把同学们的答话记录下来，有时还要用录音器录下来，作为将来找麻烦的根据。
    刘国杰：
    人民的中国诞生我们有责任回来
    在我快离开美国的时候，移民局还叫我去询问：“你喜欢蒋介石政府还是毛泽东政府？”我干脆告诉他：“我喜欢新政府不喜欢老政府，过去我就是看不惯蒋介石政府的贪污腐化，受不了蒋介石政府无理的压迫，我才离开中国。我在老政府下十几年的公务员生活尝够了他们的滋味，现在人民的中国诞生了，我要回去，因为我有责任要担负起新中国的建设工作。”
    沈体兰：
    今天各位报道了美帝国主义反民主反和平的种种事实，也反映了美国人民反对战争爱好和平的心理，希望各位同学有机会向国内同胞广泛宣传，并把国内情形多多告诉留在美国的同学，希望他们尽早回来，共同为新中国建设而努力！
