　　People's Militia Hero Ren Xiansheng
    Comrade Ren Xiansheng is an old militiaman from Ren Dian, Fifth District, Nanwang, Ji Lu Yu. He is fifty-two years old. His family was poor when he was young. His father worked as a long-term laborer for landlords all his life. When Xiansheng was eighteen years old, he couldn't stand the starvation at home, so he followed his uncle and became a soldier in the old army. He was often beaten and scolded by officers, so he deserted. After returning home, he worked for others on a monthly or short-term basis, or did small business to support his family. He worked himself to death, but still had to eat tree bark and leaves.
    In the spring of the 35th year of the Republic of China (1946), when land reform was implemented, he was allocated twelve mu of land and two hundred catties of grain. His family of five no longer suffered from hunger and cold, and the landlords and local bullies dared not bully him anymore. In order to protect this new life from infringement, he joined the militia. From then on, he enthusiastically participated in the life of combat, just like a young man.
    During the conscription movement, he was the first to send his eldest son to join the army. He said, "Chiang Kai-shek, that turtle son, wants to kick our rice bowl. If we don't join the army, we won't be able to protect our few acres of land." After that, every time his eldest son returned home, he would tell him to work hard, "Don't forget that it was the Communist Party who led us to turn over."
    When the People's Liberation War began, the traitor Chiang Kai-shek's troops arrived in the Ren Dian area. Four enemy soldiers were digging melons in the fields of the common people. When Comrade Xiansheng heard about it, he went around behind the enemy with a gun, rushed over in one stride, and said to an enemy with a gun, "Dare to move! I'll kill you! Put down your gun quickly, the People's Liberation Army treats prisoners leniently!" The four Chiang soldiers knelt down and obediently became prisoners of the old hero. Last December, more than three hundred enemies surrounded Zhang Lou layer by layer. Comrade Ren knew that the district headquarters was still in Zhang Lou, so he led twelve militiamen to relieve the siege. Some militiamen were afraid and dared not move forward. He took off his shirt and said to everyone, "Our district chief is still inside, those who are not afraid of death, follow me!" After he shouted this, two other militiamen also took off their shirts and rushed up. The enemy was so frightened by the fierce momentum that they ran away with their tails between their legs. This time, Comrade Ren wounded an enemy soldier, allowing more than thirty people from the district headquarters to escape. When our liberated army withdrew north of the Yellow River for rest and reorganization, the enemy temporarily occupied cities and some villages and towns south of the Yellow River. One night in July, more than twenty special agents of the "Home-Returning Corps" arrested the village chief of Ren Dian Village, forcing him to pay money and grain, and tortured him severely. Comrade Ren cleverly climbed onto the roof and fired four shots at the enemy. The enemy scurried away, and the village chief and the masses were all grateful to him. Once, a landlord in Zhang Lou engaged in activities to aid the enemy by giving them money and supplies. When he found out, he went to Zhang Lou alone, found the bad landlord who was engaging in activities to aid the enemy, and said to him, "The People's Liberation Army is not far from us, the district headquarters is in × Village, do you want to move your heads?" Zhang Lou was only one li away from the enemy, but in the end, they did not send anything to the enemy. Ren Lanxi, Ren Fawang, and Ren Xuegong from Ren Dian Village joined the "Home-Returning Corps." Comrade Xiansheng often said to their families, "Chiang Kai-shek's troops will not last long. In the future, the world will still belong to our Eighth Route Army. Tell them to come back, I guarantee they will be fine." The pseudo-family members said, "You are an honest person, you don't tell lies, we will definitely call our children back." In this way, three "Home-Returning Corps" members were won over and brought back a box cannon to the government to repent.
    Because he was so brave and resourceful, and won the support of the broad masses, the local landlords, bad elements, special agents, and "Home-Returning Corps" feared and hated him. The enemy had used various methods to harm him and capture him, but they all failed every time.

　　民兵英雄任献胜
    任献胜同志是冀鲁豫南旺五区任店的老民兵，年五十二岁。幼时家庭贫苦。父亲给地主当了一辈长工。献胜十八岁时，因在家挨饿，没法过，跟他叔父当了旧军队的兵，常常受官长的打骂，不能干，就开了小差。回家后，给人家打月工、短工或作小买卖来维持全家的生活。忙死忙活，还少不了吃树皮树叶子。
    民国三十五年春实行土地改革，他分了十二亩地，二百斤粮食，一家五口再不挨饿受冻，地主恶霸也再不敢欺负他了。他为着保护这新的生活不受侵犯，就参加了民兵。从此他便象青年人一样热情的参加了战斗的生活。
    在参军运动中，他首先把大儿子送去参军。他说：“蒋介石这个龟孙要踢咱的饭碗，咱不参军，咱的几亩地保不住。”以后他大儿子每次回家，他都嘱咐他好好干，“不要忘了是共产党领导咱们翻的身。”
    人民解放战争开始，卖国贼蒋介石的队伍到了任店一带，有四个敌兵到老百姓地里翻瓜，献胜同志听说了，一人一枪绕到敌人后边，一个箭步冲过去，对准了一个有枪的敌人说：“敢动！我打死你！快把枪放下，解放军优待俘虏！”四个蒋军跪下了，顺从的作了老英雄的俘虏。去年腊月，敌人三百多名把张楼层层包围，任同志知道区部还在张楼住，他就率领民兵十二人去解围。民兵有的害怕，不敢向前，他脱了个光脊梁向大家说：“咱区长还在里头，不怕死的跟我来！”经他这样一喊，另外两个民兵也脱成光脊梁冲了上去，敌人一看来势很猛，吓得屁滚尿流的跑了。这次任同志打伤敌人一名，使区部三十余人脱了险。在我解放大军撤到黄河以北休整时，敌人暂时的盘据在黄河以南的城市和一些村镇里。七月某夜，特务“还乡团”二十余人抓任店村村长逼款要粮，拷打甚紧，任同志便机警的爬到屋顶，向敌人连打四枪，敌人一溜烟窜了，村长和群众无不感激他。有一次，张楼的地主活动资敌，迎接敌人，他知道了，一个人到张楼找到活动资敌的坏地主，对他说：“解放军离咱这里不远，区部就在×庄，你们的脑袋想搬家了？”张楼只离敌人一里，但也终未给敌人送东西。任店村任兰喜，任法旺、任学工三人参加了“还乡团”，献胜同志经常与他们家属说：“蒋介石的队伍长不了，将来还是咱八路军的天下，叫他们回来吧，我保险没事。”伪属们说：“你是个老实人，不说瞎话，俺一定把孩子叫回来。”就这样三个“还乡团”员被争取了回来，并带来匣枪一支，到政府悔过。
    因为他这样英勇机智，获得广大群众拥护，因此当地的地主坏蛋及特务“还乡团”又怕他，又恨他。敌人曾用各种办法来害他，捉他，可是他们每次都落了空。
