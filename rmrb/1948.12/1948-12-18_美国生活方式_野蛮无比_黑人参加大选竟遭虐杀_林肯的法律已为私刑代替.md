　　“American Way of Life” is Extremely Barbaric
  　Black Man Tortured and Killed for Participating in Election
    Lincoln's Law Replaced by Lynching
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 15th] Horrifying news of the persecution and killing of Black people in the United States during the recent U.S. election continues to emerge. According to statistics from the National Negro Council of the United States, during this year's election, in the five southern states alone, two million qualified Black voters were disenfranchised (Associated Press). Black people, who account for one-tenth of the total U.S. population, numbering 15 million, have never enjoyed equal and free voting rights in various U.S. elections. Especially in the southern states where ten million Black people live, although Black people account for one-third to more than half of the total population there, the vast majority are deprived of their constitutional right to vote due to unreasonable restrictions such as "poll taxes," "grandfather clauses," and "vagrancy laws." A small number of Black people who are registered and dare to vote are almost inevitably subjected to beatings, insults, and even lynching by the henchmen of the Southern landlords and capitalists, and the Ku Klux Klan thugs who rant "white supremacy." In Georgia, which has more than one million Black people, only one Black man, Nixon, voted in the state's primary this year, and he was shot and killed by a white man named Johnson as a result. In the same state, a Black farmer named Mallard was recently assassinated by Ku Klux Klan members in white robes for participating in the election. Zaslavsky, editor-in-chief of the Soviet newspaper Pravda, recently wrote an article in Pravda entitled "Lincoln's America is on Trial in the Lynching Courts of the Timber District" commenting on the Mallard incident: "According to Lincoln's law, Black people in the United States are free and equal citizens. According to the law of the timber district (named after the illegal lynching used by Virginia landlord and judge Lynch), any Black person who wants to exercise his or her civil rights can be executed without trial. Is the United States now implementing Lincoln's law? Or Lynch's law? The answer is clear: although a memorial hall has been built for Lincoln, the true hero of the American ruling class is Lynch." Zaslavsky pointed out that the Mallard incident will make the European people resent the "American way of life" that the Americans are spreading there.

　　“美国生活方式”野蛮无比
  　黑人参加大选竟遭虐杀
    林肯的法律已为私刑代替
    【新华社陕北十五日电】美国黑人在此次美国大选中惨遭迫害与虐杀的骇人消息陆续传来。据美国全国黑人委员会统计，在本年的大选中，单只南方五个州内，即有二百万合格的黑人选民被取消了选举权（美联社）。占美国总人口十分之一，数达一千五百万的黑人，在美国各种选举中从来没有享有平等自由的投票权。尤其是在一千万黑人聚居的南方诸州，虽然那里的黑人占总人口三分之一以至一半以上，但是，由于“人头税”、“祖父法”、“游民律”等等的无理限制，绝大部分都被剥夺了宪法规定的投票权。少数登记合格而又敢于投票的黑人，就几乎不可避免地要遭南方大地主大资本家的爪牙、狂吠“白人至上”的三Ｋ党匪徒的殴打凌辱直到私刑杀害。在有一百多万黑人的乔治亚洲，只有一个黑人尼克逊在今年该州预选中参加了投票，他就因此而为白人约翰生所枪杀。在同一州内，黑人农民马拉德因为参加了大选的投票，亦于最近为头蒙白布的三Ｋ党所暗杀。苏联真理报总编辑萨斯拉夫斯基，近以“林肯的美国正在林区的私刑法庭上受审”为题，在真理报撰文评论马拉德事件称：“根据林肯的法律，美国黑人是自由平等的公民。根据林区的法律（按系因弗吉尼亚州大地主与法官林区使用非法私刑而得名），凡想行使其公民权的黑人，即可不经审判而处死。现在美国实行的是林肯法呢？还是林区法呢？答案是明确的：虽然已给林肯建立起纪念堂，但美国统治阶级的真正英雄是林区。”萨斯拉夫斯基指出：马拉德事件将使欧洲人民愤恨美国人正在那里散布的“美国生活方式”。
