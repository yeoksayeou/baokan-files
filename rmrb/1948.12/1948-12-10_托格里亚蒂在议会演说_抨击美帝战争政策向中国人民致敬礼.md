　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 7th: According to a report from the Electronegative Agency in Rome: Italian Communist leader Togliatti delivered a speech on December 2nd during a parliamentary debate on foreign policy. In his speech, he severely criticized the war policy of the United States and the Gasperi government, which followed this policy, and saluted the Chinese people who were victoriously resisting American aggression. Togliatti pointed out: The forces demanding peace are stronger than the forces preparing for war. War today is not inevitable, but can be prevented; but the warmongers in the United States must be stopped so that they dare not speak. War will only be inevitable when the forces of peace are unprepared and give the forces of war an opportunity to take advantage of. Togliatti then went on to expose the war policy of the United States, saying: The war policy of the United States, from the Truman Doctrine to the Marshall Plan and the Atlantic Pact, from propaganda development to economic organization, to political organization, is now developing to the stage of preparing troops and organizing aggressive armed forces. This can be seen in the recent contacts and meetings between the general staff headquarters of Western countries. In order to prepare troops, these general staff headquarters need people. The United States has spent billions of taxpayers' dollars in China, but has not been able to crush the Chinese people's liberation struggle. At this point, Togliatti specially represents the Italian people in extending warm greetings to the Chinese liberation forces led by Mao Zedong. Togliatti continued: The Gasperi government has placed itself in the ranks of the war front, but it is hiding this from the Italian people. Togliatti said to Gasperi's followers: "You dare not tell the country, because you know the country will not tolerate these things." Togliatti then listed the Italian Communist Party's program in terms of foreign policy, saying: "Italy must not hate the people of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union, must eliminate anti-Sovietism, invest its strength in production and trade with all countries, prevent the division of Europe desired by American imperialism, support all actions intended to eliminate the danger of war, support disarmament and the destruction of atomic bombs, and oppose all actions that aggravate international conflicts. This is truly a policy that takes the country into consideration. The Italian Communist Party is happy to cooperate with all forces in the country that demand peace.

　　托格里亚蒂在议会演说
  　抨击美帝战争政策向中国人民致敬礼
    【新华社陕北七日电】据电通社罗马讯：意共领袖托格里亚蒂于本月二日在议会辩论外交政策时发表演说。他在演说中严厉地抨击美国的战争政策以及追随这一政策的加斯贝利政府，并向胜利地反抗着美国侵略的中国人民致敬。托氏指出：要求和平的力量比准备战争的力量强大。战争在今天不是不可避免的，而是能够防止的；但是必须制止美国那些好战的家伙，使之不敢作声。只有当和平势力没有准备而予战争势力以可乘之机时，战争才会不可避免。托氏接着就揭露美国的战争政策说：美国的战争政策，从杜鲁门主义到马歇尔计划及大西洋公约，从宣传发展到经济组织，到政治组织，现在正发展到准备军队和组织侵略武装的阶段。这可见之于西方国家各参谋本部间近日的接触和会议中。为着准备军队，这些参谋本部需要人。美国在中国化费了纳税人的数十亿美元，但并没有能粉碎中国人民的解放斗争。至此，托格里亚蒂特代表意大利人民向以毛泽东为首的中国解放力量致热烈的敬礼。托氏继称：加斯贝利政府已置身于战争阵线的行列，但它却向意大利人民隐瞒这一点。托氏对加斯贝利的党徒说：“你们不敢告诉全国，因为你们知道全国不会容忍这些事情。”托氏进而列举意共在外交政策方面的纲领说：“意大利必须不仇视美、英、苏三国的人民，必须肃清反苏主义，将力量投入生产和与一切国家的贸易中，防止为美国帝国主义所期望的欧洲分裂，支持一切意在消除战争危险的举动，支持裁军和毁灭原子弹，反对一切使国际冲突加剧的举动。这才是真正为国家着想的政策。意大利共产党乐意与国内一切要求和平的力量合作。
