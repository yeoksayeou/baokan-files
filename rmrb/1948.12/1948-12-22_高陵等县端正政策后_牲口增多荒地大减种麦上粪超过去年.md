　　高陵等县端正政策后
    牲口增多荒地大减种麦上粪超过去年
    【冀鲁豫电】冀鲁豫四分区巩固地区，经过端正政策后，提高了农民生产情绪，扩大了农业投资。根据高陵县齐村、观砦、李固、滑县东起砦、路砦曹街等五个村四二九户统计，耕地四零零一亩，种麦三零零三亩，占总地数百分之七十五。据去年滑县老区梁村集、徐五营等七个村统计，耕地一五七四一亩，种麦九七零八亩，占总地数百分之六十一。前后比较，今年增加种麦面积百分之十四。长垣刘沟邱和前瓦屋等半老区村庄，也比去年扩大了耕地、种麦面积到百分之十至十二点七。在牲畜方面：滑县蔡营牲畜由五十六头增加到一零五头；东起砦原有牲畜八十六头，今秋又增添了二十二头。在施肥上：农民不但在自己原有的土地上施肥，而且一般的都在新分得的土地上上了粪。据滑县东起砦一七二户的调查，去年种麦一七零六亩，内上草粪一一五七大车，上豆子和豆饼一四一六斤；今年种麦一七零六亩，内上草粪一三二七大车，上豆子、豆饼一五零六八斤；前后比较，如以豆子和豆饼二十斤顶草粪一大车计算，则施测量比去年增加百分之六十九。由于我党土改和生产政策的深入，农民生产情绪提高，长垣十区十五个村的逃亡户已返回来三十五户共九十九人。长垣二十四个村统计：共有熟荒一二三一亩，种麦中结合补偿安置，鼓励农民耕种，共消灭了一一五三亩，占百分之九十三点七。
