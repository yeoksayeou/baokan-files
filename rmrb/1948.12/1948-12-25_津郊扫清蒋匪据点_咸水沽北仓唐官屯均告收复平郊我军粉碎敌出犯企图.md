Xinhua News Agency, Pingjin Front, December 21st: The People's Liberation Army, after occupying Junliangcheng, continued to advance south, occupying the important stronghold of Xianshuigu southeast of Tianjin on the 20th. Thus, the railway and highway transportation between Tianjin and Tanggu, and between Tianjin and Dagu, were completely cut off. Xianshuigu is located about fifty miles southeast of Tianjin and was the original site of Tianjin County. In the northwest of Tianjin, the People's Liberation Army, in the battle to capture Yangcun on the 19th, completely annihilated a regiment of the 5th Brigade of the 333rd Division (formerly the Railway Protection Army) of the enemy's 105th Army and part of the division's direct units, capturing over 1,680 enemy soldiers, including the 333rd Division's chief of staff, and killing or wounding over 200 enemy soldiers, including the division commander, Song Haichao. At the same time, a part of the enemy's 62nd Army was wiped out in Nancang, capturing 302 enemy soldiers.

Xinhua News Agency, Pingjin Front, December 23rd: Tianjin, the largest industrial and commercial city in North China, and Tanggu, its important eastern seaport, have become isolated like Beiping. While occupying Junliangcheng and Xianshuigu on the 19th and 20th, completely cutting off railway and highway transportation between Tianjin and Tanggu, the People's Liberation Army controlled the Jinpu Railway from Tianjin south to Tangguantun, about 130 miles long, on the 20th, occupying important stations such as Tangguantun and Chenguantun, and Jinghai County. On the same day, another unit of the People's Liberation Army captured Yangliuqing Town, thirty miles west of Tianjin, annihilating over 500 defending enemies. The People's Liberation Army on the Beining Line, after occupying Beicang, eighteen miles northwest of Tianjin, is pressing towards Tianjin's new station. This unit of the People's Liberation Army occupied Yixingbu, five miles north of Tianjin, on the 21st. By this point, all the outer strongholds of Tianjin had been removed. To the east of Tianjin, the People's Liberation Army is converging on Tanggu from the north, west, and south. The People's Liberation Army, having occupied Hangu, crossed the Jinzhong River on the 16th, completely controlling the Jinzhong Railway Bridge and Beitang Station, and occupied Haitan Station on the 21st, with its vanguard approaching the northern suburbs of Tanggu. Another unit of the People's Liberation Army occupied Xinhe Station west of Tanggu on the 21st. At the same time, the People's Liberation Army, having occupied Xianshuigu, has advanced rapidly towards Dagu.

Xinhua News Agency, Pingjin Front, December 22nd: The People's Liberation Army on the Beiping front has repeatedly repelled enemies invading from the isolated city of Beiping and smashed the enemy's attempt to reoccupy Nanyuan Airport. On the 19th, the enemy attempted to recapture Nanyuan Airport, mobilizing two divisions and advancing in two directions. One route, the entire 56th Division of the enemy's 92nd Army, with sixteen tanks, attacked Jiugong, more than ten miles east of Nanyuan, via Dahongmen and Wulidian, launching repeated assaults, but was repelled by the People's Liberation Army. The enemy suffered over a hundred casualties and had two tanks destroyed. The other route, two regiments of the 4th Division of the enemy's 13th Army, advanced from Daliushu towards Wangsiying and Xiaohaitun, more than ten miles east of the city. The enemy launched four assaults, but was repelled each time, leaving behind over a hundred corpses before fleeing back. Prior to this, the 5th Division of the enemy's 94th Army in Beiping attacked the People's Liberation Army positions near Huangcun, more than thirty miles south of Beiping, on the 16th, resulting in over a thousand enemy soldiers killed or wounded, and four tanks destroyed. The remnants fled back to Beiping. In addition, a part of the pseudo-Hebei Provincial Security Forces, over 1,200 men, surrendered to the People's Liberation Army in Panggezhuang, Huangcun, and other places south of Beiping on the 18th, bringing with them three mortars, five anti-aircraft guns, seventeen 60mm mortars, seven grenade launchers, seven heavy machine guns, seventy-nine light machine guns, and 1,556 rifles and pistols. The People's Liberation Army also searched and captured over 760 scattered bandits in the area.
