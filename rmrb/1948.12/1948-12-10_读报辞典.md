　　Reading the Newspaper Dictionary

　　Togliatti
　　Leader of the Italian Communist Party. He has served as a member of the Executive Committee of the Third International for as long as 19 years since 1924, so he has long been prestigious among the European working class. During World War II, he led the Italian people in the fight against fascism. After the war, he continued to lead the Italian working class and the people in their struggle against the reactionaries.

　　Tokuda Kyuichi
　　General Secretary of the Japanese Communist Party, 54 years old. Since the founding of the Japanese Communist Party, he has always insisted on fighting against Japanese fascism. He fought unyieldingly even after living in the Japanese reactionaries' prison for 18 years. He was elected as a member of the Japanese Diet last year and enjoys high prestige among the Japanese working class.

　　MacArthur
　　About 67 years old, one of the American imperialist warlords and a Republican. After World War II, he was the American representative to the Allied Council for Japan. Stationed in Japan, he supported the revival of Japanese militarism and, together with the Japanese reactionaries, oppressed the Japanese working people.

　　Franco
　　The "Head of State" of Fascist Spain, the leader of the Spanish Falange, and an ally of Hitler. He suppressed the Spanish people with brutal terror and should be one of the major war criminals of World War II, but he is protected by American imperialism. Now, the fascist Franco is just like Chiang Kai-shek in China, also with American imperialism as his foreign daddy.

　　"Marshall Plan"
　　That is, the "European Economic Recovery Plan" proposed by Marshall in his speech at Harvard University on June 4 last year. It is aimed at saving the American economic crisis, taking advantage of the economic difficulties of European countries after the war, and using "aid" as a guise to achieve the purpose of invading the economic sovereignty of European countries, and attempting to organize the "Western European Union" to carry out conspiracies against the Soviet Union and the New Democratic countries of Eastern Europe; to split Germany, support German Nazis, and attempt to rebuild Germany as its military aggression base.

　　Taft-Hartley Act
　　An anti-labor bill formulated by Taft, Chairman of the Senate Labor Committee, and Hartley, Chairman of the House Labor Committee. The content is: to prohibit joint negotiations by workers in the same industry, to prohibit the free establishment of trade unions, workers are not allowed to freely join trade unions, trade unions are prohibited from including communists and those considered to be helping communist ideas or policies, and workers are not allowed to strike. This reactionary bill attempts to completely deprive American workers of their basic rights, and American workers have been fiercely opposed to it.

　　Truman Doctrine
　　It is the expansionist and aggressive policy of U.S. President Truman. On the one hand, it spreads anti-Soviet and anti-communist sentiments and creates new wars. On the other hand, it expands the scope of aggression through "aid" to reactionaries in various countries and attempts to solve the American economic crisis. This reactionary policy is specifically manifested in helping Chiang Kai-shek and other reactionaries in various countries to massacre the people.

　　American Council on Democracy in the Far East
　　Founded in the summer of 1945 by American scholars and celebrities with expertise in Far Eastern issues. Famous journalists Strong, Epstein, Stein, Noulens, black singer Robeson, and others are all members of the association. It is one of the groups that actively guides and organizes the American people to oppose the U.S. reactionaries' policy towards the Far East. In October 1946, it launched a large-scale "U.S. Troops Out of China Week" movement.

　　Militarism
　　The regime of certain imperialist countries is manipulated by a small number of warlords. They advocate expanding armaments, increasing military expenditures, implementing compulsory military service and military training for the people, instilling the people with fascist education of armed aggression, militarizing national industries and arming the people, and engaging in military aggression abroad. For example, Japan in the past was a militarist country. The power of the state was in the hands of a few warlords in the military (the military command organ in Japan with military power). A police system was implemented domestically to suppress the people's democratic movement. Externally, a very concrete example is the armed invasion of our country. Although Japanese imperialism was defeated by us in World War II, now, due to MacArthur's support, Japanese reactionaries are using a large part of the national financial budget to expand police expenses and force students to undergo military training, attempting to revive militarism in Japan.

　　Wuhu
　　An important city in Anhui Province and one of China's major rice markets. It is located on the east bank of the Yangtze River, more than a hundred miles southwest of Nanjing, and is the center of the Jingwu and Huainan railways, making it a commercial city. Although it produces the most rice, under the brutal rule of the Kuomintang, there are many starving people, and rice-snatching riots occur constantly.

　　读报辞典
    托格里亚蒂
    意大利共产党领袖。一九二四年起担任了第三国际执行委员会委员十九年之久，因此他在欧洲工人阶级中早就具有声望了。第二次世界大战中，他领导了意大利人民与法西斯斗争。战后仍领导意大利工人阶级和人民一直和反动派作斗争。
    德田球一
    日本共产党的总书记，五十四岁。自日共成立后，他对日本法西斯一直坚持着斗争，就是在日本反动派狱中住了十八年，也不屈地斗争着。去年当选为日本国会议员，在日本工人阶级中的威信很高。
    麦克阿瑟
    约六十七岁，美帝国主义军阀之一，美国共和党人。第二次世界大战后是盟国对日委员会美国代表。他驻在日本，扶植日本军国主义的复活，与日本反动派一起压迫日本劳动人民。
    佛朗哥
    法西斯西班牙的“元首”，是西班牙长枪党党魁，希特勒的同盟者，以兽性的恐怖手段镇压西班牙人民，应是第二次世界大战重要战犯之一，但为美帝国主义所庇护。现在，法西斯佛朗哥就如同中国的蒋介石，也以美帝国主义作他的洋爸爸。
    “马歇尔计划”
    即去年六月四日马歇尔在哈佛大学讲演时提出的“欧洲经济复兴计划”，是为了挽救美国经济危机，利用战后欧洲各国的经济困难，以“援助”为名，达到侵略欧洲各国经济主权的目的，并图谋组织“西欧联盟”进行反苏反东欧新民主国家的阴谋活动；分裂德国，扶植德国纳粹，图重建德国为其军事侵略基地。
    塔夫脱—哈特莱法案
    美国参院劳工委员会主席塔夫脱及众院劳工委员会主席哈特莱所制定的反劳工法案。内容是：禁止同业工人联合谈判，不准自由成立工会，工人不准自由加入工会，工会中禁止容有共产党以及被认为是帮助共产党思想或政策的人，不准工人罢工。这个反动的法案，企图把美国工人的基本权利剥夺净光，美国工人一直予以猛烈的反对。
    杜鲁门主义
    是美国总统杜鲁门的扩张侵略政策。一面散布反苏反共空气，制造新的战争，一面经过对各国反动派的“援助”，扩大侵略范围，并幻想解脱美国的经济危机。这个反动政策具体表现在帮助蒋介石和希土等各国反动派屠杀人民。
    美国民主远东政策委员会
    一九四五年夏由美国对远东问题有研究的学者与名流所组成。名记者史特郎、爱泼斯坦、史坦因、罗尔波、黑人歌王罗伯逊等都是该会会员。是一个积极指导与组织美国人民反对美国反动派对远东政策的团体之一。一九四六年十月曾发起大规模的美军“退出中国周”运动。
    军国主义
    某些帝国主义国家的政权，操纵在少数军阀手里，他们主张扩大军备、增加军费，对国民实行强迫兵役及军事训练，灌输国民以武力侵略的法西斯教育，使国家产业军备化，国民军事化，对外从事军事侵略。如过去日本就是一个军国主义国家。国家大权掌握在军部（日本握有军权的军令机关）的几个军阀手里，国内实行警察制，镇压人民民主运动。对外，很具体的例子就是武力侵略我国。日本帝国主义虽在第二次世界大战被我们打败了，但现在，由于麦克阿瑟的扶植，日本反动派正以国家财政预算很大一部用作扩充警察费用，并强迫学生军训，图使军国主义复活于日本。
    芜湖
    为安徽省重要城市，中国大米市之一。于长江东岸，在南京西南百余里处，又为京芜、淮南两铁路中心，为一商业城市。虽然这里产米最多，在国民党残暴统治下，饥民却很多，不断发生抢米风潮。
