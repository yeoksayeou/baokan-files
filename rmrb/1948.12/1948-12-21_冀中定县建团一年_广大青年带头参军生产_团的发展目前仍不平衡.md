(By our newspaper) One Year of Youth League Building in Ding County, Central Hebei
Broad Masses of Youth Take the Lead in Joining the Army and Production
Development of the League Remains Uneven

[Our Newspaper] Ding County, in the Central Hebei District, is a large county with twenty districts, one city, four hundred villages, a population of approximately 400,000, and about 70,000 young people. It is relatively developed culturally, with thirty-four higher primary schools, eight middle school classes, one normal school, and one middle school. The county began building the Youth League at the end of last year during the land redistribution movement. The leadership adhered to the correct policy of "mass line, voluntary participation, and open League building," achieving considerable success and gaining some experience. Currently, the county has a total of one hundred and sixty-five League branches (including one hundred and fifty rural branches and fifteen school branches). According to statistics from one hundred and forty-six branches, there are a total of three thousand five hundred and thirty-three League members. They have played a significant pioneering role in movements such as land redistribution, production, and joining the army. Now, in all aspects, the general public, parents of League members, and district and village cadres have very good feedback on the Youth League. Many district cadres deeply feel that the Youth League is a powerful assistant in promoting work, and they pay attention to promoting the League's work when they go to villages.

At the beginning of the land redistribution, the former CCP Jin-Cha-Ji Central Bureau and the Central Hebei District Party Committee decided to make Ding County the key county for Youth League work, and designated the Ninth District as the key district for the entire county. Cadres from the Border Region Youth Federation and the County Youth Committee were assigned to work in the key districts. Initially, the cadres lacked experience in conducting youth work during the land redistribution movement and only proposed mobilizing poor and middle peasant youth to participate in the Poor Peasants League and the New Peasants Association to participate in land redistribution. At this time, the peasants urgently demanded the establishment of armed organizations to monitor the activities of feudal forces, and the young people were willing to do this work. Thus, in the villages where land redistribution was being carried out, teams of investigators, new militia, or land protection groups were organized with young people as the backbone. The young people monitored feudal elements, transported floating wealth, and stood guard, playing a significant role. Some young people, at accusation meetings, denounced the oppression inflicted upon them by the feudal ruling class, and their awareness gradually increased.

The deepening of the land redistribution movement presented new problems for youth work: the young people participating in armed organizations such as investigation teams were busy standing guard, watching over things, and delivering messages, and could not or rarely attend meetings. They did not have separate education and training, making it difficult for them to keep up with the development of the movement. The general poor and middle peasant youth demanded further organization and education for themselves. Starting from the end of January this year, youth pioneer teams adapting to these demands were established in some villages. When establishing these teams, a broad review of events since the land redistribution was first carried out among the youth, with criticism and self-criticism. At the same time, the League was promoted. Those who signed up to join the youth pioneer teams had to be approved by all the young people. In addition to participating in general struggles, some youth pioneer teams also helped military families with production and were responsible for rooftop broadcasting, etc.

　　　　Most villages implemented the policy of "mass line, voluntary participation, and open League building."

As the land redistribution movement continued to develop, many new young activists emerged. They were not satisfied with general organizations. The youth pioneer team organizations in some villages were too large, and needed the support of a core. Some young people wanted to join the Party. Some experience in youth work had also been accumulated. On February 4, the County Party Committee decided to build the League, first reporting on the League-building work at a county-wide cadre meeting, and organizing a special youth work symposium to prepare the cadres ideologically for League building. Some villages convened youth representative meetings. On March 17, a county-wide youth cadre meeting was held to train cadres and dispatch them to key districts for organization. The method of building the League was basically divided into two types: individual absorption and self-nomination with evaluation. First, various methods were used to explain the significance and role of the League to the youth in the branches, the Poor Peasants League, the New Peasants Association, and the general public. An open call for registration was made at the youth meeting, followed by evaluation by the youth, review by the branches, the Poor Peasants League, and the New Peasants Association, and finally approval by the district, and then the swearing-in ceremony to join the League. The vast majority of villages implemented this policy of "mass line, voluntary participation, and open League building." Only a small number of villages suffered because of insufficient publicity and preparation, and the youth had a lower level of awareness.

The newly established Youth League immediately accepted the test of joining the army, with excellent results. In villages with a Youth League, meetings of the Youth League were first convened to mobilize joining the army. League members who met the requirements competed to enlist in the army and were able to mobilize others. Many model deeds emerged. The twenty-six cadres of the Youth League branch committee of the First Sub-district of the Ninth District, twenty-four signed up to join the army. A total of one hundred and thirty-one League members joined the army in the Sixth District, becoming the backbone of the new soldiers. When the secretary of the League branch and three League members from Mingyuedian joined the army, they motivated twenty-nine other people. This time of joining the army promoted the revolutionary heroism of the youth, increased the awareness of the League members, and guaranteed the completion of the task of joining the army through open discussion and the use of activists. The League organization expanded during and after the process of joining the army, and many people attached greater importance to the League. However, in daily work, what the League should do and how it should do it still lacked experience.

When the wheat harvest and hoeing season arrived, the leadership proposed that League members should actively engage in production, that youth activities should not hinder production, that organizing youth production should strive for family consent, and that it should be combined with learning whenever possible. Most branches showed positive strength. During the wheat tax collection, the Youth League participated in this work, and League members generally ensured that they delivered early and well. The leadership also gained a lot of experience in this stage of production: to establish a labor concept among the youth. This was generally listed as a condition for joining the League. As soon as the production task arrived, the youth were mobilized to first take care of their own family's production, and it was not emphasized that they should help others. Small group life should include production as one of its main contents, educating the youth to learn production skills. Later, the League also played a certain role in opposing superstition and preparing for war. Experience has proven that mobilizing youth to actively participate in central work, gradually raising their awareness and status, is the proper way out for youth work and is worth considering for other places.

At present, the development of the League in Ding County is still uneven. One-quarter is relatively sound, one-half is average, and one-quarter is still relatively poor. This is mainly manifested in insufficient ideological mobilization, and there are still remnants of coercion and commandism in the work style. Therefore, it is necessary to provide specific leadership based on different situations, improve organization, raise awareness, and always cater to the actual situation of the youth, leading them to advance step by step.

### 冀中定县建团一年　广大青年带头参军生产　团的发展目前仍不平衡

　　冀中定县建团一年
    广大青年带头参军生产
    团的发展目前仍不平衡
    【本报讯】冀中区定县是一个大县，有二十个区，一个市，四百个村，人口约四十万，青年约七万，文化较发达，现有三十四个高小，八个中学班、一个师范、一个中学。该县从去年年底开始，在平分土地运动中建立青年团。领导上坚持贯彻了“群众路线、自觉自愿、公开建团”的正确方针，获得了相当成绩，并摸索出一些经验。现全县共有一百六十五个团支部（其中农村支部一百五十个，学校支部十五个），据一百四十六个支部统计，共有团员三五三三人。他们在平分土地、生产、参军等运动中，都起了相当的先锋作用。现在各方面，一般群众、团员家长、和区村干部对青年团反映都很好，不少区干部深切感到青年团对推进工作是一个有力助手，到村就注意推动团的工作。
    平分土地开始，前中共晋察冀中央局和冀中区党委都决定以定县为团工作的重点县，并以九区为全县的重点区，边区青联会的干部和县青委干部，分别配备到重点区工作。开始，干部都缺乏在平分运动中进行青年工作的经验，只提出发动贫雇中农青年参加贫农团新农会，参加平分。这时农民迫切要求成立监视封建势力活动的武装组织，青年们愿意干这种工作，于是就在进行平分的村庄，组织了以青年为骨干的纠查队、新民兵或保田小组。青年们监视封建、搬运浮财、站岗放哨，起了很大作用。有些青年在诉苦会上，控诉封建统治阶级给予自己的压迫，觉悟逐步提高。
    平分运动的深入给青年工作提出新问题：参加纠查队等武装组织的青年忙于站岗放哨看差送信，不能或很少参加会议，没有单独的教育训练，很难赶上运动的发展，一般贫中农青年，都要求给自己进一步的组织教育。从今年一月底开始，适应这种要求的青年先锋队就在部分村庄建立了。建立时先在青年中展开平分以来的广泛检讨，进行批评与自我批评，同时进行团的宣传。报名参加青先队者须经全体青年评议通过。青先队除了参加一般斗争外，有的还帮助军属生产，负责屋顶广播等。
    　　　　大部村庄都贯彻“群众路线、自觉自愿、公开建团”方针。
    平分运动继续发展，涌现了许多新的青年积极分子，他们不能满足于一般的组织；有些村庄的青先队组织太大，需要有核心的支持；有些青年要求入党；青年工作的经验也积累了一些。二月四日，县委即决定建团，先在全县干部大会上报告了建团工作，组织专门的青年工作座谈会，使干部对于建团作了思想准备。某些村庄召开了青年代表会。三月十七日又召开了全县的青年干部会，训练干部，分赴重点区组织。建团的方法基本上分两种：一种是个别吸收，一种是自报评议。先用各种方法把团的意义和作用向支部、贫农团、新农会中的青年及一般群众讲清楚，在青年大会上公开号召报名，经过青年评议，支部、贫农团和新农会审查，最后由区批准，宣誓入团。绝大部分村庄都贯彻了这种“群众路线、自觉自愿、公开建团”的方针，只有少数村因宣传、酝酿不够，青年觉悟较低。
    刚建立的青年团就接受了参军的考验，成绩极佳。凡有青年团的村庄，都是先召开青年团的会议动员参军，够条件的团员争先入伍，并能动员别人。模范事迹出现很多。九区一小区团支委会二十六个干部，二十四个报名参军。六个区入伍的团员共一百三十一人，成了新战士的骨干。明月店团的支书和三个团员参军时带动了二十九个人。这次参军，发扬了青年的革命英雄主义，提高了团员的觉悟，用公开讨论，使用积极分子的方法，保证完成参军任务。团的组织在参军中及以后都扩大了，许多人对团更重视了。但是，在日常工作上，团干什么，怎样干？还是缺乏经验的。
    到了麦收锄苗季节，领导上提出：团员要积极生产，青年活动不能妨碍生产，组织青年生产要争取家庭同意，可能时结合学习的方针，大部分支部都显示了积极的力量。麦征时，青年团都参加了这一工作，团员一般做到交得早，交好的。领导上在这一段生产中，也获得不少经验：要树立青年的劳动观念。入团条件一般都列上这一条。生产任务一到，即动员青年先把自己家庭的生产搞好，不能强调帮助别人。小组生活应把生产列为主要内容之一，教育青年学习生产本事。以后在反迷信和备战中，团也起了一定的作用。经验证明：动员青年积极参加中心工作，逐步提高自己的觉悟和地位，是青年工作正当的出路，值得各地参考。
    现在定县团的发展尚不平衡，四分之一比较健全，二分之一是平常的，四分之一还比较差，主要表现在思想发动不够，作风还有强迫命令的残余。因此应当分别不同情况，给以具体领导，健全组织，提高觉悟，凡事切合青年的实际情况，领导青年逐步前进。
