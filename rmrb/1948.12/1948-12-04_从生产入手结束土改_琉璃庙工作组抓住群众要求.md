　　Ending Land Reform by Starting with Production
    The Luli Temple Work Group Grasps the Demands of the Masses
    [Our Newspaper] Su Youmin reports: The work group in Luli Temple Village, Second District, Nangong County, Jinnan, went deep into farmers' households, mobilized and organized farmers to intensify winter production to reduce their burdens and solve the problem of insufficient food for the masses. The work group was originally sent to the village to do party rectification and replenishment work, but after arriving in the village, they found that the masses were having difficulty in their lives this year because they did not collect much grain, and after paying the burdens, they all wanted to engage in winter production first. However, because the propaganda on production and land reform policies was not enough in the past, everyone was waiting and watching. The work group immediately organized all the village cadres, divided them into groups and went deep into the farmers to understand their specific difficulties and ideological concerns, and explained to everyone our party's policies on developing production and the specific policies of land reform, so that everyone eliminated their concerns and began to actively carry out various production activities. The cotton gin of middle peasant Han Guangzhu started working. Song Dengjun knew how to leach saltpeter, but had many difficulties, so they helped him borrow a house, he borrowed some furniture himself, and helped him find two partners, and the three of them started leaching saltpeter. The cadres also promptly introduced production experiences and methods to the whole village using tools such as broadcast announcements and public blackboards. After vigorous promotion and organization, the whole village has now started production with 26 cotton gins, 3 cotton batting bows, 2 black oil workshops, 2 sesame oil workshops, 1 flour mill, 1 hemp rope shop, 1 grinding shop, and 1 tofu shop. Among them, a total of 17 new businesses were opened after solving difficulties through policy education. Han Guangtian's cotton gin has earned 90,000 yuan since it started work on the first day of the tenth lunar month and in fifteen days. Thirty transport trucks, reorganized from the original foundation, went to Linqing to "earn a living" after the first batch of autumn land was cultivated. More than 50 masons, newly reorganized based on the original foundation, have sent six people to work in other villages and solicit work in the city, and most of them are preparing to set off immediately. All 99 looms, 1 iron-wheeled loom, and more than 400 spinning wheels in the village are now turning and producing, and they have also found their own targets and dug two cellars, which can accommodate dozens of spinning wheels and two looms, and two more will be dug recently. Out of 439 households in the whole village, a total of 152 male laborers and more than 500 female laborers have now been mobilized. Dong Zhigang's family was assigned 269 catties of public grain this year, and was very worried at first. After the work group helped plan production, they calculated that in three months this winter, weaving one cloth in half a month, weaving two military cloths, they could offset all the public grain. Weaving two handmade cloths can earn 10,000 yuan, which are the jobs that have already been secured. In this way, the grain will be completely enough to eat, and there will be pocket money. Others, such as Tian Wenming, Han Ke'en, Han Qinshi, and landlord Han Jinpo, all felt helpless when they first had no concrete plans, but after calculating the accounts and making concrete plans, they all felt that there were ways and means, and difficulties could be overcome. Now the vast majority of the masses in the whole village have started production based on the initially established household plans. Many farmers who were indifferent when production was first organized now believe in the work group's call: "Work hard in production, and there will be a way," and understand that ending land reform is precisely for the sake of developing production. From the 13th, they have begun to brew class division, preparing to replenish. Everyone is at ease.

　　从生产入手结束土改
    琉璃庙工作组抓住群众要求
    【本报讯】苏幼民报导：冀南南宫县二区琉璃庙村的工作组，深入农户，发动与组织农民以加紧冬季生产来减轻负担，解决群众粮食不足的困难。该工作组本来是到村去做整党与抽补工作的，但到村后发现群众今年因收粮不多，出了负担以后，生活发生困难，都想先闹冬季生产。但因过去对生产与土改政策宣传不够，大家都观望，工作组即组织全村干部，分片分户深入到农民中去，了解他们的具体困难与思想顾虑，给大家讲解我党发展生产的政策与土改的具体政策，使大家消除了顾虑，开始积极进行各方面的生产活动。中农韩光柱的轧花车开动了。宋登俊会淋硝，但有许多困难，就帮他借了所房子，他自己借到了些家具，又帮他搭了两个伙计，三个人淋起硝来了，干部又把生产的经验与方法及时以号播、大众黑板等工具介绍给全村。经过大力推动与组织，现在全村已经动手生产的有轧花车廿六盘、弹花风弓三架、黑油房两座、香油房两个，粉房一个、麻绳铺一家、磨面房一家、豆腐房一家。其中经过政策教育解决困难新开张的共十七家。韩广田的一盘轧车从十月初一动工，十五天已赚洋九万元。运输组大车三十辆于第一批秋地耕完后，已往临清去“拉脚”。根据旧有基础新整顿起来的泥瓦匠班五十多人，已派出六人到外村做活，到城里揽活，大多数准备即日动身。全村九十九架织布机、一架铁轮织布机、纺车四百多辆，已经件件转动着生产，并已自找对象刨好两个地窖子，能容纺车几十辆，织布机两架，最近能再有两个刨成。全村四百三十九户，现在共动了男劳力一百五十二人，女劳力五百人以上。董治刚家今年派了公粮二百六十九斤，开始很发愁，经过工作组帮助计划生产，今冬三个月，以半个月纺织一个布算，织军布两个，即可抵住全部公粮。织手工布两个，可得一万元，以上是已经揽到手里的活。这样，粮食可完全够吃，并有了零用。其他如田文明、韩克恩、韩秦氏、地主韩金坡等，都是开始没有具体计划时觉着没办法，而一经过算帐，订出具体计划后，又都觉着有了办法，有了门路，困难可以克服。现在全村绝大多数群众已经在初订的按家计划上动手生产。开始组织生产时，许多表示冷淡的农民，现在都相信了工作组的号召：“努力生产，就有办法”，了解了结束土改正是为了发展生产，从十三日起，已开始酝酿划阶级，准备抽补。大家都安了心。
