University Education in North China Over the Past Three Years

(I)
With the great victory of the People's Liberation War, university education in our North China region has also seen significant development over the past three years. Since the establishment of the North China Liberated Area in June this year, the two revolutionary universities of the former Jin-Cha-Ji and Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu areas—North China United University and Northern University—were also merged into North China University in August. The convergence of these two people's cultural armies indicates that university education in our North China region has moved from decentralization to centralization, and is developing further.

North China United University was established in the third year of the War of Resistance Against Japan, in 1939. Under the leadership of President Cheng Fangwu, North China United University has trained more than 19,000 cadres over the past nine years. In July 1941, it established three colleges—Literature and Art, Politics and Law, and Education—as well as two departments: Mass Work and High School. With over 4,000 faculty members and students, it persisted in wartime university education in the harsh environment behind enemy lines. After Japan's surrender, young students from large cities such as Zhangjiakou, Beijing, and Tianjin flocked to study. In October 1946, it moved to central Hebei, establishing four colleges: Literature and Art, Politics, Education, and Foreign Languages. Before merging with Peking University, the university had over 1,000 faculty members and students.

Northern University was established in November 1945 upon the decision of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region Government Committee. Comrade Fan Wenlan was the president. In January 1946, a university preparatory course and preparatory courses for the Colleges of Finance and Economics and Administration were first established. After June, five colleges—Literature and Education, Administration, Finance and Economics, Engineering, and Medicine—were established successively. In October, the university moved from Xingtai City to near Changzhi City. In June 1946, the Literary Research Office was expanded into the College of Literature and Art, and the university headquarters established the History and Finance and Economics Research Offices. Before merging with United University, in addition to more than 1,000 graduates, the university had over 1,500 faculty members and students.

North China United University and Northern University both grew stronger under the difficult conditions of enemy, puppet, and Chiang Kai-shek "sweeps" and "divisions." Now, the two universities are merging to adapt to the needs of the developing situation, and have been renamed North China University. Its main task is to absorb university and high school students from the Kuomintang areas, to study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and to train them to become construction cadres in various fields of the new China. The university currently has over 3,000 faculty members and students.

(II)
North China University is now headed by Comrade Wu Yuzhang as President, with Comrades Fan Wenlan and Cheng Fangwu as Vice Presidents, and Comrade Qian Junrui as Dean of Studies. The university headquarters has two departments: Academic Affairs and General Affairs, as well as a Secretariat and a Nursery. The university has four departments and two colleges.

The First Department is of a political training class nature, headed concurrently by Comrade Qian Junrui, with Comrades Chen Weishi and Li Xin as deputy directors. The task of this department is to provide incoming young intellectuals with basic knowledge of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, to lay a preliminary foundation for a revolutionary outlook on life, to understand the program and policies of the Chinese Communist Party, and to appreciate the work style that a revolutionary should possess. There are four types of courses: 1. Basic Theory, mainly including dialectical and historical materialism, political economy, and the history of social development; 2. History of the New Democratic Revolution in China; 3. Introduction to the CCP, explaining the principles of the Chinese Communist Party's ideological, political, and organizational construction; 4. Policy, explaining the tasks, nature, and driving forces of the Chinese revolution, the highest and lowest programs of the Chinese Communist Party, the general line and general policy of New Democracy, and various specific policies. There are also lectures on current events and work methods. The basic spirit of learning is to seek truth from facts, pursue truth, and allow for bold doubts and free debate. The teaching method adopts the principle of self-study and guidance, combined with theory and practical activities. The study period will be flexible depending on the specific circumstances of the development of the revolutionary situation, and is tentatively set at three to six months. After graduation, most will go out to work and participate in the political, economic, cultural, and educational construction work of the liberated areas, while a portion will transfer to other departments of the university to continue studying or to do research work.

The Second Department is of the nature of a college of education, and its task is to specialize in training teachers for secondary schools and other educational cadres. Comrades He Ganzhi and Ding Haochuan serve as the director and deputy director respectively. There are six departments: Chinese Language, History and Geography, Education, Social Sciences, Foreign Languages, and Mathematics and Physics. The study period is tentatively set at two years for the Foreign Languages Department, and six months for the other departments. The educational content includes three common compulsory courses: Chinese Language, Introduction to Social Sciences, and Introduction to Education. The Chinese Language Department offers courses such as Modern Literary Selections, Composition and Grammar, Evolution of Chinese Characters, and New Chinese Literature. The History and Geography Department offers courses such as General History of China, Selected Readings of Historical Materials, History of the World Revolutionary Movement, History of American Aggression Against China, and Chinese and Foreign Geography. The Education Department offers courses such as Introduction to Education, Teaching Methods, Educational Administration, Educational Statistics, and Modern Chinese Educational History. The Social Sciences Department offers courses such as Concepts of Social Sciences, History of Chinese Social Development, Political Economy, and Introduction to Philosophy. In addition, various lectures are offered. In order to closely link theory with practice, it is planned to establish a correspondence research department to maintain timely contact with teachers in various middle schools, and to use a local middle school and normal school as experimental schools; to participate in local education conferences to understand local education conditions; and to organize internships and visits to verify whether the content learned is consistent with reality.

The Third Department is of the nature of a college of literature and art, with the aim of training literary and art cadres to serve workers, peasants, and soldiers. Comrade Shakov is the director, and Comrades Ai Qing and Guang Weiran are the deputy directors. A Work-Study Group is established to train general art cadres. Its professional education adopts self-study, mutual assistance, guidance, review, and summarization. The department helps organize theatrical troupes on campus for practice, and participates in various social literary and art activities off campus. A Cultural Work Troupe is established to engage in literary and art activities in a specific area, and to train military theatrical troupes, worker theatrical troupes, and transform old rural artists. In addition, there are art factories and musical instrument factories.

The Fourth Department is a research department, with the purpose of studying specific specialized problems and cultivating and improving university faculty. Comrade Fan Wenlan concurrently serves as the director, and Comrade Ai Siqi as the deputy director. The comrades in this department are divided into two types: researchers and graduate students. Professors, lecturers, and teachers all participate in a type of research work as researchers; graduate students assist researchers in conducting research work. Currently, there are eight research offices: Chinese History, Philosophy, Chinese Language, International Law, Foreign Languages, Politics, Education, and Literature and Art.

The College of Agriculture aims to cultivate agricultural construction talents, and adopts the educational policy of combining education, research, and production. Comrade Le Tianyu is the president. Currently, there are three departments: Economic Botany, Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine, and Sugar Industry. A research office has also been established as the center for promoting the work of the entire college; and a rural education work team has been organized to serve the peasants in a specific area.

The task of the College of Engineering is to cultivate industrial construction cadres for the new democratic state. Comrade Liu Zaisheng is the president, and Comrades Yun Ziqiang and Zeng Yi are the deputy presidents. It is divided into two parts: the University Department and the Higher Vocational Department. The University Department currently has two departments: Electrical Engineering and Chemical Engineering. Students admitted are high school graduates with excellent grades and those who have studied science and engineering at the university level for more than one year. The teaching method focuses on concentrating efforts to learn a certain part of technical knowledge well according to the courses needed in reality, simplifying and refining. The study period is tentatively set at two years. This department also has a preparatory class and a preliminary class to enable students with a weaker level to improve after a certain period of tutoring and then enter the University Department. The Higher Vocational Department currently has classes in Chemical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, and Electrical Engineering. Students admitted are junior high school graduates, high school dropouts, junior factory cadres, and technicians. The study period is tentatively set at six months.

In addition to the main library, branch libraries and reference rooms are also set up in various departments and colleges. The total number of books is more than 60,000. In addition, the Academic Affairs Office has prepared more than 60 kinds of teaching materials and teaching reference books, with a total of more than 40,000 copies, which are distributed in batches to various departments and classes for students to use for learning.

(III)
In the past three years, our North China Liberated Area has been connected into one piece from being divided, and the liberation of the entire North China is about to come; in the future, university education in North China is even more important. North China University must not only train more talents to build North China and even the whole country, but also promote various experiences in creating a new type of people's university to the whole country, becoming the backbone of building a new China's university education.

　　华北三年以来的大学教育
    （一）
    随着人民解放战争的伟大胜利，三年来，我华北区的大学教育也有着显著的发展。自今年六月华北解放区成立，原晋察冀与晋冀鲁豫两区的两个革命大学——华北联合大学与北方大学也在八月合并成为华北大学。这两支人民文化军的会合，说明我华北区的大学教育已经由分散到集中，并且更进一步向前发展了。
