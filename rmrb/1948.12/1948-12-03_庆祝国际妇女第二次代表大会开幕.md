　　The Second International Women's Congress, convened by the Women's International Democratic Federation, is scheduled to open today in Budapest, Hungary. The Women's International Democratic Federation originally planned to hold the Asian Women's Conference in India, but it was obstructed by the reactionary Nehru government. Therefore, it was decided to hold a joint meeting of the Colonial Committee of the Democratic Women's Federation and the Preparatory Committee of the Asian Women's Conference, which will also be held in Budapest. We, representing the women of China, wish these two conferences success.
　　The Women's International Democratic Federation was founded on October 26, 1945, immediately after the end of the World Anti-Fascist War. On this day, 850 representatives from 42 countries of the Democratic Women's Federation gathered in Paris and adopted three important resolutions: to fight for democracy, peace, and anti-fascism; to improve the economic, legal, and social status of women; and to protect children and improve education. For three years, international women have made unremitting efforts towards these goals. Together with all peace-loving and democratic forces in the world, and organizations such as the World Federation of Trade Unions, the World Federation of Democratic Youth, and the International Union of Students, they are advancing hand in hand in the struggle for world peace, democracy, and progress. Democratic women have contributed great strength in the struggle against instigators of new wars. Because their goals and work meet the requirements of all peace-loving and democratic women in the world, the International Women's Federation now has the participation of democratic women from more than 50 countries, with more than 80 million members. It is precisely because of this that when the American imperialists and the reactionaries of other countries are preparing for a new world war, when they are carrying out sabotage conspiracies against all peace-loving and democratic groups, they do not relax their sabotage against the Democratic Women's Federation. International reactionaries and right-wing elements of socialist parties in various countries have tried every means to make socialist women withdraw from the Federation and establish women's organizations used by the reactionaries. This attempt to violate the interests of international democratic women has failed so far. But international reactionaries will never give up their despicable attempts. In the struggle to defend world peace and democracy and oppose the threat of new wars, and in the struggle to consolidate and expand the united front of international women for peace and democracy, the International Women's Federation will still have many complex and arduous tasks to accomplish.
　　This conference will review the activities of the International Women's Federation over the past three years, formulate the tasks of international women in the struggle for peace and democracy, how to obtain political and economic guarantees for women, review the development of women's democratic movements in Asia and Africa, and review the situation of children. We believe that the conference will make necessary resolutions on these issues. We believe that the conference can set out concrete work steps and methods for the implementation of these resolutions, so that in the future, the International Democratic Women's Federation can more widely unite all women in the world who do not want their husbands and sons to be cannon fodder for a few big capitalists in the struggle for peace and democracy, and can more widely unite women in all colonial and semi-colonial countries in Asia and Africa who demand national liberation.
　　The Women's International Democratic Federation holds great sympathy and attaches importance to the liberation struggle of women in Asia and China. In its letter to Asian women in May this year, it said: "We see with admiration that although you are poor and cruelly oppressed, you persevere unyieldingly and bravely in the struggle to liberate your children and motherland from slavery. We look forward with joy and satisfaction to seeing the continuous strengthening of democratic women's organizations." We hereby protest the obstruction of the Asian Women's Conference, which the Democratic Women's Federation prepared and convened this time, by the Nehru government. But we believe that the sabotage of reactionaries can only strengthen the unity of democratic women in the world, especially democratic women in Asia. We hope that the Asian Women's Conference can be convened quickly in another suitable place. In its letter to the women in the Chinese Liberated Areas in May this year, the Democratic Women's Federation said: "Democratic women all over the world are very impressed by the efforts and achievements of Chinese sisters. We are sincerely with you and have full confidence in your final victory." We are deeply grateful for this encouragement. We are willing to tell our sisters in various countries that Chinese women are unremittingly realizing this expectation of the International Women's Federation. In the eight-year struggle against Japanese imperialism and in the struggle against American imperialism and its running dog, the Kuomintang reactionaries, for more than three years, Chinese women have taken over the task of production in the rear after a large number of men went to the front. They are doing various self-sacrificing work to support the front. Whether they are intellectual women or working women, old women or young women, they are all automatically involved in this great struggle. The feudal system of thousands of years and the insults, oppression, and bondage imposed on them by imperialism for more than a hundred years are being rapidly eliminated. However, the Chinese women's liberation struggle is not without difficulties. Foreign and domestic enemies still exist, and Chinese women themselves still have many weaknesses. In addition to continuing to bravely fight against domestic and foreign enemies, Chinese women also hope that the International Democratic Women's Federation will continue to support our struggle, help us jointly expose and protest the crimes of the Kuomintang reactionaries, the running dogs of American imperialism, in massacring Chinese women and children, raise medicines and other relief supplies to assist Chinese women and children, and strengthen the connection between women in advanced countries and Chinese women.

### 庆祝国际妇女第二次代表大会开幕

　　庆祝国际妇女第二次代表大会开幕
    国际民主妇女联盟所召集的国际妇女第二次代表大会，决定在今天在匈京布达佩斯开幕。国际民主妇联原决定于印度召开亚洲妇女大会，因受反动的尼赫鲁政府所阻挠，乃改行召开民主妇联殖民地委员会和亚洲妇女大会筹委会的联席会议，这一会议亦将于布达佩斯举行。我们代表中国妇女，预祝这两个会议的成功。
    国际民主妇女联盟成立于紧接在世界反法西斯战争胜利结束之后的一九四五年十月廿六日。在这一天，有四十二国八百五十名民主妇联的代表集会于巴黎，通过了关于为民主和平和反法西斯主义而斗争，关于改善妇女在经济上、法律上、社会上的地位，关于保护儿童及改进教育等三项重要决议。三年来，国际妇女为它的目标作了不懈的奋斗。它和世界一切和平民主力量在一起，和世界职工联盟，世界民主青年联盟，世界学联等组织，在为世界和平民主与进步而奋斗中手携手地前进。在为反对新的战争挑拨者的斗争中，民主妇女贡献了伟大的力量。因为她们的目标和工作，符合于全世界一切爱好和平民主的妇女的要求，所以国际妇联到现在已有五十多国民主妇女参加，拥有八千万以上的会员。也正因为这样，当美帝国主义者和其他各国反动派准备新的世界战争的时候，当他们对一切和平民主团体进行破坏阴谋的时候，他们也不放松对于民主妇联的破坏。国际反动派和各国社会党的右派曾经想尽方法，企图使社会党妇女退出妇联，另外成立反动派所御用的妇女团体。这一违背国际民主妇女利益的企图，直到现在为止是失败了。但是国际反动派决不会就此放弃他们卑劣的企图。在为保卫世界和平民主与反对新的战争威胁的斗争中，在为巩固和扩大国际妇女和平民主的统一战线的斗争中，国际妇联将还有很多复杂而艰苦的工作要做。
    这次大会将检讨三年来国际妇联的活动，制定国际妇女为和平民主而斗争的任务，如何求得妇女在政治经济上的保障，检阅亚非两洲妇女民主运动的发展与检讨儿童状况等。我们相信，大会将对这些问题作出适合需要的决议。我们相信，大会能够对实现这些决议定出具体的工作步骤和办法，使得今后国际民主妇联在为和平民主而斗争中，能够更广泛地团结全世界一切不愿意她们的丈夫和儿子为少数大资本家当炮灰的妇女，能够更广泛地团结亚洲和非洲一切殖民地半殖民地国家中要求民族解放的妇女。
    国际民主妇联对于亚洲和中国妇女的解放斗争抱着极大的同情和重视，在其今年五月致亚洲妇女书中说：“我们带着赞赏，看到你们虽然贫穷，虽然残酷地被压迫，但不屈不挠坚持勇敢地把你们的孩子和祖国从奴役中解放出来的斗争。我们期盼欣慰，看到民主的妇女团体不断地加强。”民主妇联这次所筹备召集的亚洲妇女大会，竟受尼赫鲁政府的阻挠，我们在此表示抗议。但是我们相信，反动分子的破坏，只能加强世界民主妇女尤其是亚洲民主妇女的团结。我们希望亚洲妇女大会能够另择一个适当的地方迅速召开。民主妇联于今年五月向中国解放区妇女致敬的信上说：“全世界的民主妇女对中国姊妹的努力和成就甚为感佩。我们忠诚的和你们在一起，并对你们最后的胜利抱有充分的信心。”这种鼓励，使我们深深感激。我们愿意告诉各国的姊妹们，中国妇女正在不懈怠地实现国际妇联的这个期望。在反对日本帝国主义的八年斗争中，在反对美国帝国主义及其走狗国民党反动派三年多以来的斗争中，中国妇女接替了男人大批上前线后后方生产的任务，她们为支援前线而作着各种自我牺牲的工作，无论知识妇女和劳动妇女，老年妇女和青年妇女都自动的卷入这一伟大的斗争中，几千年的封建制度和一百多年来帝国主义所加于她们身上的侮辱，压迫和束缚，正在迅速地被消灭着。但是，中国妇女的解放斗争还不是没有困难的，国外和国内的敌人还是存在着，而中国妇女自身也还有许多弱点。中国妇女除了继续勇敢地和国内外的敌人进行斗争外，还希望国际民主妇女对我们的斗争继续声援，帮助我们共同揭露和抗议美帝国主义走狗国民党反动派屠杀中国妇女儿童的罪行，募集医药品和其他救济物资来援助中国妇女儿童，并加强各先进国妇女与中国妇女的联系。
