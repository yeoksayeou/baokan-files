    Industrial Construction Over the Past Year
    Shijiazhuang's industry, over the past year, under the leadership of the democratic government and the joint efforts of all workers, has overcome various difficulties, enabling all factories to resume work one after another. During this period, not only were the factories under the rule of the Kuomintang restored, but they were further developed, with the successive establishment of many factories for glass, paper, soda, machinery, soap, etc., and some factories have added branches. The industrial development over the past year has laid a solid foundation for the future construction of Shijiazhuang and has significant implications for the future construction of all of North China.

    A year ago, when the reporter first set foot in this newly liberated people's city, all factories were shut down due to the severe destruction by the Chiang bandits. Workers at the Daxing Yarn Factory were voluntarily rescuing workshops that caught fire due to indiscriminate bombing by Chiang's planes. The power plant was unable to transmit electricity due to bombing by Chiang's planes, and water pipes and telephone lines were destroyed. The chimneys of all factories stopped breathing. However, under such difficult conditions, how was recovery and development achieved? After the reporter learned from all aspects, the process and experience of industrial recovery and development in Shijiazhuang were found.

    The industrial construction of Shijiazhuang can be divided into three stages. The first stage: the early days of liberation, before the publication of the Xinhua News Agency's editorial commemorating the "February 7th" strike correcting leftist adventurism. At that time, because we had just come from the countryside and entered the big city for the first time, some senior staff in the old factories took a contemptuous attitude towards us: "Let's see if you country bumpkins can manage these modern factories?" Some workers also had some doubts about us because they had been deceived by the Kuomintang's propaganda for a long time. Coincidentally, we also mechanically moved the rural methods to the city, which caused many mistakes in our work. For example, the emergence of anarchistic ideas. In Factory 301, administratively, some workers were asked to move their dormitories. At first, the workers resolutely refused to move, and said, "Now I am the master, you are the servants. We will move when we are happy." In the review of Kuomintang personnel, there was no distinction, and everyone was treated the same. But during this period, all factories were initially restored to work.

    The second stage: from the publication of the Xinhua News Agency's editorial commemorating "February 7th" to around the North China Conference of Industry and Commerce. The leftist thinking of cadres was clarified, which changed the attitude of workers towards us. During this period, attention began to be paid to the operation and management of factories, wages began to be adjusted, the relationship between cadres and original employees was further improved, trade unions were re-established or reformed, and work was strengthened to strengthen worker unity and pay attention to worker welfare. This stage also took some detours. For example, although various factories established some systems and regulations, they were not uniform, and each had its own set. On the wage system, some of the original employees requested an increase. In the early days of liberation, because the factories had not yet resumed work, temporary wages of three, four, or five catties of millet were implemented uniformly for workers, which was a necessary measure during the transition period. However, this method was not changed until the beginning of March. Although the adjustment of the wage system ensured the livelihood of the workers, it did not get rid of the thinking of egalitarianism. The highest-paid skilled workers in the Electric Light Company only had wages of 320 catties of millet, the lowest-paid technicians had 220 catties, and the highest-paid apprentices also had 160 catties. The highest-paid electrical maintenance worker in Factory 302 only had 290 catties. Assistants and apprentices also had a maximum of 210 catties, so some technicians were not at ease with their work, which affected production.

    From the North China Conference of Industry and Commerce in May until now is the third period. During this period, the production of various factories has become regularized, and some factories have begun to implement enterprise management, strengthen economic management, establish economic accounting and cost accounting, re-establish factory management committees, strengthen the connection between the Party, government, and trade unions, clarify the factory director responsibility system, and the Shijiazhuang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China organized a factory work committee to concentrate efforts to uniformly solve the major problems of various factories, and promptly sent work groups to help various factories carry out rectification work. During this period, the production and operation of various factories have made great achievements. Especially in this time of war preparation and resumption of work, the workers of various factories have created many miracles. The Qianjin Factory completed two weeks of work resumption plan in 24 hours due to the active efforts of the workers. The Telephone Bureau completed three months of work resumption plan in ten days. Factory 301 also fully resumed work in 24 hours. The workers demonstrated a high degree of enthusiasm and creativity. Now, they are actively responding to the call of the Municipal Party Committee to launch a tense production competition to increase production and compensate for the losses of war preparation.

    一年来的工业建设
    石家庄的工业，一年来，在民主政府领导和全体职工的共同努力之下，克服种种困难，使所有的工厂，都先后复工了。这一时期，不仅恢复了国民党时代所统治下的各工厂，而且还更进一步的发展了，相继建立了玻璃、造纸、汽水、机器、肥皂等许多工厂，并且有某些工厂都增添了分厂。这一年来，在工业上的发展，给今后建设石家庄，奠定了稳固的基础，并对今后建设全华北亦有重大的意义。
    一年前，当记者初踏进这座刚解放的人民的城市时，各工厂都因遭蒋匪严重的破坏而停工了，大兴纱厂的工人们，正自动抢救因蒋机滥炸起火的工房，发电厂被蒋机滥炸的不能送电，自来水管和电话线被炸毁，所有的工厂里的烟囱都停止了呼吸。可是，在这样种种困难的条件下，如何恢复与发展起来的呢？经过记者从各方面了解，找出了石家庄市工业恢复与发展的经过及其经验。
    石家庄市的工业建设，可分为三个阶段。第一个阶段：是解放的初期。新华社纪念“二七”纠正左倾冒险主义社论未发表前。当时，因为我们刚刚从农村里出来，初次踏进大城市，有些工厂里旧的高级职员，对我们采取轻蔑的态度：“看你们这些土包子，能不能管理这些近代化的工厂？”有些工人也因长期受国民党的欺骗宣传，而对我们有些怀疑。恰巧，我们也把农村的一套，机械的搬到城市里来，在工作中曾产生了不少错误。如无政府思想的产生，三○一工厂行政上，要一部分工人搬一搬宿舍，开始工人坚决不搬，还说：“现在我是主人，你们是勤务员，我们高兴搬才搬。”在审查国民党人员中，没有分别对象，而是一律看待。但这一时期所有的工厂都初步的复工了。
    第二阶段：从新华社纪念“二七”的社论发表后，华北工商会议前后的时期，干部左倾思想澄清，改变了职工们对我们的态度，这一时期开始注意到工厂的经营、管理，开始调整工资，进一步地改善干部与原有职工的关系，重新成立或改造职工会，加强职工团结，注意职工的福利等工作。这一阶段也走了一些弯路，如各工厂虽然建立了一些制度、规章，但都不统一，各有各的一套。在工资制度上，原有的职工中有一部分要求提高。在解放初期，各工厂因尚未复工，实行了带救济性质的、职工一律按三、四、五斤小米不等的临时工资，这是过渡时期一种必要的措施。但这种办法直到三月初，才开始改变。调整工资制度后，虽然使工人生活上得到保障，但没有摆脱平均主义的思想。电灯公司最高技术工人，只有工资小米三百二十斤，技工最低的二百二十斤，学徒最高的也有一百六十斤。三○二工厂电机保全工人最高者才二百九十斤。助手和学徒最高也有二百一十斤的，因此，有些技术人员不安心工作，以致影响了生产。
    五月华北工商会议后，直到现在，为第三个时期。在这期间内，各工厂生产都走入正规，有的工厂已经开始实行企业化，加强经济管理，建立经济核算和成本会计，重新成立了工厂管理委员会，加强党、政、工的联系，明确厂长负责制，中共石家庄市委会，组织了工厂工作委员会，集中力量来统一解决各工厂的重大问题，并及时的派去工作组，帮助各工厂进行整顿工作。这一时期各工厂生产经营均有很大成绩，特别在这次备战和复工中，各工厂职工都创造了许许多多的奇绩。前进工厂，由于工人的积极努力，以二十四小时的时间完成了两个星期的复工计划，电话局十天完成了三个月的复工计划，三○一工厂也是二十四小时全部复工的。工人们发挥了高度的积极性和创造性。现在，他们正以积极的响应市委会关于开展增产，补偿备战工作损失的号召，掀起紧张的生产竞赛运动。
