　　Production for Self-Salvation Overcomes the Yan Bandit Disaster
  　The Experience of the People of Pingding in Victory Over Famine

    [Reported by this newspaper] Lü Guangming and Bu Ke reported: The people of Pingding, Shanxi, under the correct leadership of the Communist Party and the democratic government, fully utilized the various production conditions in the region, organized themselves for production and self-salvation, and after more than a year of arduous struggle, finally completely overcame the severe famine. After being brutally destroyed and plundered by the Japanese invaders and the Yan bandits, many dyers lost their jobs, private coal and iron industries collapsed, and farmers lost all their savings of years of agricultural materials and tools, making people's production and life extremely difficult. In addition, the severe drought last year resulted in an unprecedented famine. In the 293 administrative villages in northern Pingding County, the average harvest was less than 20%. Samsung Village, with a population of more than 300, harvested only fifteen or sixteen *shi* of grain in the entire village. Villages along the Zhengtai Railway and around Yangquan City, which suffered the most from the Yan bandit's "soldier-farmer integration," faced even greater hardship. In the 145 villages, including Jingwozhuang, people mostly ate wild vegetables and tree leaves in the three months before last autumn, rarely eating grain. In villages such as Fengjiayu, many elm trees were stripped bare. With no hope for the autumn harvest, people were anxious. Some people wanted to go out to make a living. In the month or so before the autumn harvest, there were as many as 37 cases of divorce, early marriage, and child brides in nine villages in the Second District. At that time, every village had beggars. Due to the drought and lack of grass, the money earned was not enough to feed the livestock. Some villages began to sell their animals. In Chaikou Village, a large dappled donkey was sold for only four *da sheng* of rice. In Xinao Village, Li Dongchuan bought a mule with one *dou* of wheat. Saboteurs took the opportunity to spread rumors. In Longzhuang Village, the rumor was "Farmers all over the world are one family, eat one family after another." Some people were pessimistic and disappointed. There was a lack of confidence in overcoming the disaster through production. Some cadres also felt low, believing that this famine was even more terrible than the famine in 1920. This was indeed a big problem for the newly liberated areas where work had not yet been established.

    Cadres and the Masses Share Hardships; The Masses are Organized
    The county leadership first made a correct analysis and assessment of the disaster, clearly stipulating the policy of "Everything for overcoming the famine, all work revolves around overcoming the famine," emphasizing the organization of production for self-salvation. To this end, the county party committee convened an enlarged cadre meeting of all districts and held a "Village Cadre Famine Relief Training Class," and established "Production and Disaster Relief Committees" at the county, district, and village levels. County-level agencies assigned cadres to organize "Joint Offices" to specifically study the county's production and disaster relief work, and published a "Production and Disaster Relief" newsletter to introduce disaster relief experiences. With the exception of a few people staying at home to work, all cadres went to the countryside to carry out a shock campaign of production and disaster relief work, to educate the masses, to overcome negative thoughts, and to emphasize production for self-salvation and mutual assistance. They initially established a strong confidence in overcoming the famine.

    After the cadres went to the villages and households, they explained and interpreted the situation to the masses, while leading them to gather tree leaves and wild vegetables. According to statistics from 29 villages in the Second District, a total of 116,500 *jin* of black bean leaves, 26,767 *jin* of tree leaves, and 4,399 *jin* of wild vegetables were collected. In order to ensure food supply for the coming summer harvest, a widespread campaign to plant wheat was launched, and 706 *da shi* of wheat seeds were loaned out. More than 126,000 *mu* of wheat were planted in northern Pingding County, more than twice as much as the previous year. Zhangni Village, which had never planted wheat before, planted 160 *mu* in the autumn, playing a significant role in solving the food shortage this summer. From last autumn to the end of June this year, four relief grains were distributed in the villages with the most severe disasters, totaling 83,500 *jin*. Some of these grains were donated from various places, with Wutai County alone donating 10,000 *jin* of miscellaneous grains. Some were saved by the cadres. Cadres in northern Pingding County saved a total of 6,290 *jin* of millet in two months. In addition, the government successively allocated 3,809 *da shi* of production loan grain and 8.24 million *yuan* (Ji banknotes) of production loans. These grains and funds helped the masses to produce for self-salvation. According to the different specific conditions and natural conditions of each village, more than 20 kinds of industrial, handicraft, and other production activities were organized. Under the encouragement of the continuous victories of the People's Liberation War and the achievements of land reform, especially after the Zhengtai Campaign, the successive liberation of Shouyang, Shijiazhuang, and other places, and the restoration of some transportation routes, the sales of coal and iron goods in Pingding and Yangquan became increasingly smooth. The coal and iron ore industry had the conditions for development, which greatly enhanced the confidence of the broad masses and cadres in overcoming the famine. In July and August last year, the North Yue Trading Company held a meeting of managers of state-owned stores in the Second and Fourth Special Districts in the county, deciding that each store would set up a coal and iron department to promote the sales of Pingding coal and iron. The "Baoxingheng Coal and Iron General Store" was established in Yangquan City, specializing in supply and sales. After May this year, the store's monthly supply and sales volume reached 5,000 *da shi* of grain and about 450,000 *jin* of oil, salt, and cloth. In addition, special cadres were sent to central Hebei, southern Hebei, Xingtai and other places to promote sales.

    Fully Utilize Natural Conditions; Open Up Avenues for Sideline Production
    In terms of industry and mining, there were 260 raw and wrought iron furnaces in northern Pingding. From December last year to July this year, including raw, wrought, and sand casting, the number increased to 439 furnaces, with a total income of 64,360 *da shi* of millet. The number of iron ore kilns increased from 77 to 446, employing 2,426 workers, producing a total of 15,100 tons of (iron and sulfur) ore, with an income of 9,090 *da shi* of millet. The paper mill earned 1,400 *da shi* of millet. Secondly, the production of sulfur, saltpeter, black alum, and pottery for sand pots also played a significant role in overcoming the famine. Jiaoyu Village in the Sixth District overcame the famine by relying on sideline production such as saltpeter production.

    Thirdly, a large number of transportation and sales cooperatives were established. Some disaster victims in Pingding traveled long distances to central Hebei and other places to transport and sell sand pots, exchanging them for a considerable amount of cloth and grain. The county connected Jingxing, Jianping, and other counties, organizing three major transportation lines, including fourteen coal stations, specializing in the collection and sale of coal transported by the masses. The coal station in Southwest Yu was called the "Nipple" by the masses (meaning that it saved the masses). A total of 19,900 full and semi-labor forces were organized in northern Pingding, including people, livestock, and vehicles. Since May last year, the monthly transportation volume (coal, iron, ore, sleepers, etc.) has been no less than 8.4 million *jin*, with an income of 2,360 *da shi* of millet in half a year. Other unorganized sporadic carrying and carting activities cannot be calculated. The disaster has made many women and children as strong as steel. The reporter personally saw many young and middle-aged women here doing long-distance carrying of more than 100 *jin*. Starting this spring, railways and highways are being repaired. Men do heavy work, while women and children fill soil, tamp broken stones, and pave roadbeds, acting as full labor forces, earning two *sheng* of rice per day. Other activities such as men and women in Yanglinwa Village cutting strips and weaving baskets, digging medicinal herbs, and women in Wulizhuang Village weaving straw hats, also played a certain role in production for disaster relief. In Pingding, cooperative societies in some villages played a considerable role in organizing disaster relief. The cooperative in Houwa Village in the Seventh District purchased bran, vegetables, salt, grain, and sold coal and iron on behalf of the masses. The cooperative in Southwest Yu Village planned food for the masses, and the cooperative in Taopo Village organized the capital of all households in the village, combined with floating assets, to set up open-hearth furnaces and closed furnaces, organizing the entire village to overcome the famine.

　　Organize the Broad Masses of Women to Participate in Carrying and Transportation
    What is particularly worth mentioning is that the Party and non-Party cadres in Pingding learned from the fine work style of Comrade Wang Yuanshou and others, who went deep among the masses and shared their hardships. During the severe famine, many cadres went to the countryside, combining their daily ration of one *jin* of grain saved with the villagers to cook meals, eating bran and vegetables to lead the masses to overcome the famine. Women cadres, in order to motivate women to transport goods, pushed carts and carried loads with them. Comrade Ye Xiuzhi of the work team helped the villagers of Ganhe Village rebuild the sulfur mine that had been destroyed for many years. To this day, men, women, old, and young in the village still remember him. Many village cadres and Party members displayed a high degree of class friendship and indomitable fighting spirit in overcoming the famine, encouraging the masses to fight the disaster. In Changjiashan, Fourth District, there were five families who had not eaten rice for more than a month and were too weak to get out of bed. They received four *jin* and twelve *liang* of rice saved by several cadres from the Fourth District for four days, and persevered in planting the land. Many examples are enough to illustrate that the people in the liberated areas, under the leadership of the Communist Party, will not be intimidated by any disaster.

    After nearly a year of tenacious struggle by the Party, government, army, and people, the people of the entire county finally victoriously overcame the largest famine in nearly 60 years, and completed land reform in the disaster. Not a single person starved to death in Pingding County. The people sincerely thanked the Communist Party. Wang Yimao, a woman from Ganhe Village, said: "The Communist Party's leadership in production is the best thing. If our place had not been liberated, who knows how many people would have starved to death!"

　　生产自救战胜阎匪灾害
  　平定人民胜利渡过荒年胜利的经验
    【本报讯】吕光明布克报导：山西平定人民，在共产党与民主政府的正确领导下，充分利用本区各种生产条件，组织起来生产自救，坚持了一年多的艰苦斗争，终于完全战胜了严重的灾荒。该县经过日寇阎匪惨酷地破坏掳掠，许多染工失业，私营的煤铁业倒闭，农民多年的农物农具积蓄，损失净尽，人民生产、生活极感困难。加之去年旱灾严重，形成了空前的灾荒。北平定全县二九三个行政村，平均不足二成年景。三星村三百多人口，全村才收十五六石粮食。靠正太路两侧及阳泉市周围，受过阎匪“兵农合一”灾害最烈村庄，人民生活更加困苦。井窝庄等一四五个村庄，去秋前三个月中，人民多以野菜树叶充饥，很少吃到食粮。冯家峪等村榆树多扒成白光杆。秋收无望，人心惶惶，部分群众要求出外谋生，秋前一个多月中，二区九个村子，离婚、早嫁、当童养媳者，竟达卅七起之多，当时要饭吃的那村都有。天旱缺草赚的不够牲口吃，有些村开始卖牲口，岔口村一个大花驴，才卖四大升米，西瑙村李东川一斗麦买了一个骡。破坏分子乘机活动，谣言流传，龙庄村谣传“天下农民是一家，吃完一家吃一家。”部分群众悲观失望。生产渡灾信心不足，部分干部情绪也低落，他们认为这次灾荒比民国九年还可怕。这在解放不久工作尚无基础的新区来说，确是一个很大的问题。
    干群同甘共苦　群众组织起来
    该县领导上首先对灾荒作了正确的分析与估计，明确规定了“一切为了渡荒，一切工作围绕渡荒”的方针，强调组织生产自救。为此，县委召开了全县区的扩大干部会，又召开了“村干渡荒训练班”，成立了县区村三级的“生产渡灾委员会”，县级各机关抽出干部组织了“联合办公室”，专门研究全县的生产渡灾工作，出版“生产渡灾”小报，介绍渡灾经验。各机关除留少数人在家工作外，全体干部下乡，突击生产救灾工作，宣传教育群众，克服消极思想，强调生产自救与互助互济，初步树立了渡荒的坚强信心。
    干部深入到村户后，一面给群众宣传解释，一面领导群众打树叶、野菜。据二区廿九个村的统计，共采黑豆叶一一六五○○斤，树叶二六七六七斤，野菜四三九九斤。为了下年（按即今年）夏早接嘴，普遍发动种麦，并贷麦种七○六大石，北平定全县种麦十二万六千余亩，较前年多种了两倍，獐猊坪村从来没种过麦，去秋一下种了一百六十亩，对解决今夏食粮困难上，起作用很大。从去秋至今年六月末，在灾情特重村，曾发过四次救济粮，共计八三五○○斤。这些粮食，有些是各地援助的，光五台县就捐助了一万斤杂粮。有些是干部节约下的，北平定县区干部两个月共节约了六二九○斤小米。此外政府先后拨放三八○九大石的生产贷粮，八二四万元（冀钞）的生产贷款。这些粮款，扶助了群众生产自救，根据各村不同具体情况与自然条件，组织了二十余种的工业、手工业等生产。在人民解放战争不断胜利及土改成果的鼓舞下，尤其在正太战役以后，寿阳、石家庄等地的相继解放，部分交通恢复，平定、阳泉的煤铁货的销路日畅，工矿业获得发展条件，这些都大大增强了广大群众与干部战胜灾荒的信心。去年七八月间，北岳贸易公司曾在该县召开了二、四专区的公营商店的经理会议，决定各店专设煤铁部，为平定煤铁打销路，并在阳泉市成立了“宝兴亨煤铁总店”，专门办理供销，今年五月后，该店每月供销量数达五千大石粮食，油盐布匹约四十五万斤之多。此外并曾派出专门干部到冀中、冀南、邢台等地打销路。
    充分利用自然条件　打开副业生产门路
    在工矿业方面，北平定原有生熟铁炉二六○座，自去年十二月到今年七月止，包括生、熟、翻砂共发展到四三九座炉，共收入小米六四三六○大石。铁矿窑由七十七座，发展到四四六座，带动工人二四二六名，共产ｈóｎｇ＠①石（铁、磺）一五一○○吨，收入小米九○九○大石。造纸厂收入小米一四○○大石。其次是烧硫磺、熬硝、熬黑矾、烧沙壶陶器等，在渡荒中亦起了很大作用，六区角峪村靠熬硝等副业渡过了灾荒。
    再次是大量的开展了运销合作事业。平定有些灾民长途去冀中等地运销沙壶，换回不少的布片粮食，该县通井陉、建屏等县，组织了三条大运输干线，包括十四个煤炭站，专门收售群众运输的煤炭。西南舁的炭站，群众呼之为“奶头”（即把群众救活了的意思）。北平定共组织了一九九○○个整半劳动力。包括人畜车辆，从去年五月起，每月不下八四○万斤的（煤铁＠石枕木等）运输量，半年中收入小米二三六○大石。其他未加组织的零星担挑车运等，尚无法计算。灾荒将不少妇女儿童锻炼得象钢铁一样的结实，记者亲眼看见这里不少青壮妇女，做百多斤的长途担运。今春开始修铁路、汽路，男的做重活，妇女儿童垫土，捣砸碎石铺路基，顶一个整劳动力，每天可挣二升米。其他如杨林洼村男女割条编筐，刨药材，五里庄妇女编草帽，所有这些在生产渡灾中，也起了它一定作用。平定一部分村庄合作社，在组织渡荒中起到相当作用。七区后洼村合作社，购办糠菜盐粮，代群众推销煤铁，西南舁村合作社替群众筹划吃的，桃坡合作社组织了全村各户的资本，结合浮财开办了泻炉焖炉，组织全村渡过灾荒。
　　组织广大妇女　参加担挑运输
    特别值得提出的，是平定的党与非党干部，他们学习了王元寿等同志的深入群众与群众共甘苦的优良作风，在灾荒严重的时候许多干部下乡，把自己节约后的每天一斤食粮，与老乡合在一起做饭，吃糠咽菜领导群众渡荒。妇女干部为了带动妇女运输，和她们在一起推车担挑。工作组的叶修直同志，帮助甘河村老乡，把多年塌毁的琉璜矿厂重建起来，至今该村男女老少对他还念念不忘。不少村干和党员，渡荒中发挥了高度的阶级友爱与顽强无比的斗争精神，鼓舞着群众和灾荒搏斗。四区常家山有五户人家，一个多月没有吃过米，身子软的下不了地，他们得到四区几个干部四天节约下的四斤十二两米的救济，坚持着种完了地。许多事例都足以说明解放区人民，在共产党的领导下，在任何灾难面前，是不会被吓倒的。
    经过党政军民近一年来的顽强斗争，全县人民终于胜利地渡过了近六十余年来最大的一次灾荒，在灾荒中完成了土地改革。平定全县没有饿死一个人。人民衷心的感谢共产党，甘河村的妇女王义毛说：“共产党领导生产就是头一条好，咱地方要不解放，还不知饿死多少人哩！”
