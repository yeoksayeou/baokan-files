　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 7th: TASS and Telepress reported that on December 2nd, the agenda of the International Women's Congress began with a report by Mrs. Rossi, the Italian representative, on the tasks of the International Democratic Women's Federation in the struggle for peace and democracy. Mrs. Rossi declared that women would never allow their children to become mercenaries of Wall Street. She pointed out that the Democratic Women's Federation would become a pillar of democratic forces not only with political declarations but mainly with political actions. Together with the World Federation of Youth and the World Federation of Trade Unions, the Democratic Women's Federation is uniting 220 million men and women in the struggle for friendship among nations and for peace.
　　On the 2nd and 3rd, the congress continued to discuss Mrs. Rossi's report, with enthusiastic speeches by twelve or nine representatives from twenty countries. Finally, Maria Lapushva, the Soviet representative and engineer from the Red October Factory in Stalingrad, delivered a speech. The representative of this heroic city was greeted with a standing ovation and thunderous cheers from all the representatives. Lapushva said: Democratic women, the freedom, happiness, and lives of our children depend on all of us. It is not anyone else, but we ourselves, who can and must stop those madmen who are forcing the people of the world towards a new abyss of slaughter. Let us swear before the spirits of our fathers, brothers, husbands, and children who fell in the last war: we will never allow the world to be plunged into a new war.
　　On the 3rd, the congress approved the report on the activities of the Democratic Women's Federation made by Mrs. Gordon, the chairman of the International Democratic Women's Federation, and ratified the activities of the International Democratic Women's Federation over the past three years. The decision pointed out that the International Democratic Women's Federation is currently the world's largest mass women's organization, and it has gained great prestige among women in all countries due to its resolute struggle to defend peace, democracy, and women's rights. The congress called on organizations in all countries belonging to the International Democratic Women's Federation to intensify the struggle for lasting peace and friendship among nations, and against provocateurs of a new war. The resolution of the congress also outlined the guidelines for the future activities of the International Democratic Women's Federation.
　　Due to the suggestion of the US Democratic Women's representatives, the congress unanimously passed a resolution to send a telegram to the United Nations, requesting that necessary measures be taken to eradicate Franco's bloody terror and to stop the assistance of certain member states of the United Nations to Franco's Spain. In a telegram unanimously passed to the Greek government, the congress demanded an end to the mass execution of Greek democrats. The congress also passed a resolution to admit nineteen women's groups from fourteen countries, including Austria, as members.

　　国际妇女大会第二、三日
  　讨论民主妇联任务
  　坚决反对新战争挑拨者
    【新华社陕北七日电】塔斯社与电通社报导：十二月二日，国际妇女大会的议事日程，是首先由意大利代表罗西夫人报告国际民主妇女联盟在争取和平与民主之斗争中的任务。罗西夫人宣称，妇女们决不让她们的儿女当华尔街的雇佣兵。她指出，民主妇联不仅将以政治宣言而主要地是以政治行动成为民主力量的中流砥柱。民主妇联和世界青联及世界工联在一起，正将二亿二千万男女团结在争取各民族间友谊与争取和平的斗争中。
    二、三两日，大会连续讨论罗西夫人的报告，发言者极为热烈，共有二十个国家的十二九位代表。最后由苏联代表、斯大林格勒红色十月工厂的工程师玛利亚。拉普什娃发表演说。这位英雄之城的代表受到全体代表的起立致敬与雷动的欢呼。拉普什娃讲道：民主妇女们，我们儿女的自由、幸福与生命所依靠的便是我们大家。不是任何别的人、而正是我们，能够并且必须制止那些疯子，他们正在迫使世界各国人民走向新屠宰场的深渊。让我们当着在上次战争中倒下去的父兄、丈夫和儿女的在天之灵宣誓：我们决不容许使世界陷入新的战争中。
    大会于三日通过了国际民主妇联主席戈登夫人关于民主妇联活动所作的报告，批准了国际民主妇联三年来的活动。决定中指出：国际民主妇联是目前世界上最大的群众性妇女组织，它由于保卫和平、民主与妇女权利的坚毅的斗争，已在一切国家的妇女中获得伟大的声望。大会号召国际民主妇联所属一切国家的组织，加紧争取持久的和平与各民族的友谊、反对新战争挑拨者的斗争。大会的决议并规划出国际民主妇联今后活动的方针。
    由于美国民主妇女代表的建议　大会一致通过决定致电联合国，要求采取必要的措施，根除佛朗哥的血腥恐怖，并制止联合国某些会员国对佛朗哥西班牙的援助。大会在一致通过的致希腊政府的电文中，要求停止大批处死希腊民主分子。大会并通过吸收奥地利等十四个国家的十九个妇女团体为会员的决定。
