　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 6th. TASS reports: The Soviet "Labor News" recently published an article stating that under the leadership of the Romanian Workers' Party, the Romanian General Confederation of Labor has become a powerful factor in guiding the country towards socialism. In the months since the nationalization of industry, the Romanian trade unions have mobilized the masses to strive for the further development of industry, increase labor productivity, and improve product quality. This work has achieved remarkable results: the output of some industries has exceeded pre-war levels. The government has reduced the prices of food and consumer goods three times in the past five months. The trade unions are working hard to ensure the production of new types of agricultural machinery. For example, Romania recently produced one thousand self-made tractors. In order to increase the supply of agricultural tools to the countryside, the trade unions have organized work teams to help poor and middle peasants organize agricultural cooperatives. The leading bodies of the Romanian General Confederation of Labor have also taken appropriate measures to vigorously combat the class enemies who oppose the establishment of agricultural cooperatives and attempt to undermine the worker-peasant alliance.

  　帮助贫农和中农组织农业合作社
    【新华社陕北六日电】塔斯社讯：苏联劳动报顷著文称：罗马尼亚劳工联合会在罗马尼亚工人党领导下，已成为使国家走向社会主义的强有力的因素。在实行工业国有化以来的数月中，罗马尼亚职工会曾把群众动员起来，为争取工业进一步发展、提高劳动生产率及改进产品质量而斗争。这一工作已获得显著的成就：若干工业的产量已超过了战前水平。政府在过去五个月当中曾三度减低粮食及消费品价格。各职工会奋力工作，以保证新型农业机械的生产，例如在最近，罗马尼亚即有一千辆自造的拖拉机出产。为了增加对农村的农业工具的供应，职工会组织了工作队帮助贫农和中农组织农业合作社。罗马尼亚劳工联合会的领导机构又曾采取适当的措施，有力地打击了那些反对创立农业合作社、企图破坏工农联盟的阶级敌人。
