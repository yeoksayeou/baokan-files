　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 1st. Comprehensive reports: In order to strengthen its control over Latin American countries and intensify its exploitation, US imperialism is instigating fascist coups in Latin American countries that it feels it cannot fully control. On November 24th, in Venezuela, the world's third-largest and South America's largest oil producer, where the United States has $2 billion in investments, fascist elements led by former Army Chief of Staff Billetz launched a military coup, overthrowing the Democratic Action Party government led by then-President Gallegos, and formed a military council to accept power, with former Defense Minister Chalbaud as interim president and a military cabinet, with Billetz as Minister of Defense. This was the second fascist coup in Latin America in a month. The last coup took place in Peru, where fascist military leader Odría launched a coup on October 28th, exiling then-President Bustamante and appointing himself interim president, and on the 31st formed a 12-member all-military cabinet, which was recognized by the United States on November 21st. Prior to this, political disturbances had occurred successively in Bolivia, Paraguay, Panama, and Colombia. Reuter's commented that the US action in Latin America will proceed in two ways. The first is to launch a full-scale anti-communist movement, which has been tried in Brazil, Chile, and Paraguay, and Peru declared the Communist Party illegal on the third day of the new fascist government's inauguration. The second is to make the economic situation of Latin American countries more and more difficult, in order to strangle the remaining resistance in the governments of various countries. South American capitalists have lost their pre-war status as producers of raw materials and food. They originally wanted to share a profit in the Marshall Plan, but this hope has become very slim. Latin American countries could have sold $1.7 billion worth of goods in the Marshall Plan, but in reality, only $90 million has been sold so far. At the same time, the dollar shortage in Latin America has reached a serious stage, and the dumping of American manufactured goods has made it even worse, strangling the light industry that Latin America established during and after the war. Brazil, Colombia, Peru, Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, and Mexico have already started currency devaluation. It is expected that more countries will devalue their currencies soon. The lives of Latin American workers are getting worse. Under these circumstances, US decision-makers are afraid of the deepening of the people's movement, and they have determined that it is necessary to take direct action against the resistance of the Latin American people. That is why they are committed to establishing fascist rule in Latin American countries that are completely dependent on US big capital.

　　美帝图加强榨取南美连续发动法西斯政变
    【新华社陕北一日电】综合报导：美帝国主义为加强其对拉丁美洲各国的统治，以加紧其榨取起见，正在拉丁美洲中它觉得还不能完全如意操纵的国家，策动法西斯政变。十一月二十四日，在世界第三、南美第一的产油国，美国在那里有二十亿美元投资的委内瑞拉，法西斯分子、原陆军参谋总长比列兹率领陆军发动政变，推翻原总统加勒哥斯领导下的民主行动党政府，并组成军事议会接受政权，以原国防部长夏尔波德为临时总统，组成军人内阁，比列兹任国防部长。这是一个月来拉丁美洲第二次法西斯政变。上一次政变发生于秘鲁，法西斯军人领袖欧德利亚在十月二十八日策动政变，放逐原总统布斯坦姆而自任临时总统，并于三十一日组成了十二个人的清一色军人内阁，这一政府已于十一月二十一日为美国承认。在此以前，在玻利维亚、巴拉圭、巴拿马与哥伦比亚都连续发生了政治性的骚乱。电通社在评论这一连串事件时指出：美国在拉丁美洲的行动，将分两方面进行。第一是发动全力的反共运动，这在巴西、智利、巴拉圭已经试过，而秘鲁在新法西斯政府上台的第三天便宣布了共产党非法。第二是使拉丁美洲各国的经济情形愈益困难，以便扼杀各国政府中残余的抵抗力。南美资本家已失去了战前作为原料与粮食生产者的地位。他们原想在马歇尔计划中分享一笔利润，但这种希望已变得微乎其微了。拉丁美洲各国本可在马歇尔计划中卖出十七亿美元的东西，但实际上，迄今只卖出了九千万美元。同时，拉丁美洲的美元荒已达到严重阶段，而美国制成品的倾销又使之更加恶化，扼杀着拉丁美洲在战时与战后建立起来的轻工业。巴西、哥伦比亚、秘鲁、智利、阿根廷、乌拉圭和墨西哥已经开始了货币贬值。预料不久还会有更多国家的货币要贬值。拉丁美洲工人的生活正在更加恶化。在这种情形下，美国决策人害怕人民运动的深入，他们断定对拉丁美洲人民的反抗有采取直接行动之必要，这就是为什么他们致力于在拉丁美洲各国树立完全仰赖美国大资本的法西斯统治的原因。
