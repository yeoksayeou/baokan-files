Xinhua News Agency, Huaihai Front, 18th. Frontline reporters reported on the embarrassing situation of the Du Yuming bandit troops' three army corps abandoning Xuzhou and fleeing towards Xiao (County) Yong (City) road, saying: The 150,000 Kuomintang bandit troops in Xuzhou, plus tens of thousands of rear-area personnel and their families, fell into complete chaos as soon as they fled Xuzhou City under the pursuit of the People's Liberation Army. The fields, villages, and roads, big and small, along the way were crowded with countless people, all scrambling desperately to flee west. The senior officers of the bandit army were sitting in cars, rushing to escape. According to Li Wenbin, the clerk of the guard battalion of Du Yuming, who was captured: Bandit Du stayed in the car all the time after escaping from Xuzhou, never got out, ate and slept in the car, and just kept urging them to escape quickly. The other Xuzhou "Suppression General Headquarters" bandit leaders mixed in the fleeing ranks, and as soon as they heard the sound of the People's Liberation Army's pursuit, they hurriedly transferred more than a dozen tanks that were acting as rearguard to the front to clear the way, and sent an adjutant to stand on the first tank, crashing forward while shouting to the crowded people and vehicles: "I am from the General Headquarters, I am from the General Headquarters, make way, make way!" Along the way, the bandit troops scrambled to seize vehicles. The cars, horse-drawn carts, and ox carts of various army corps, agencies, and units collided with each other, creating a chaotic mess. The wives and misses who followed the senior officers of the bandit army in cars were all weeping, and many of the old and weak were trampled underfoot or crushed to death on the road in the chaos.
　　During the escape, the bandit army had two ammunition vehicles that caught fire and exploded. The bandit officers in the vehicles in front all thought that the People's Liberation Army pursuers had arrived, and immediately panicked, jumped out of the cars, and hid everywhere. Rice, flour, and clothes were scattered all over the ground. The wives of the bandit officers were scattered everywhere because they could not catch up with the fleeing troops, and several hundred were abandoned in Maozhuang, northeast of Xiao County alone. The rearguard units of the bandit army on the run were even more frightened, and did not even have time to cook a meal.

　　敌逃出徐州时
    抢先逃命搅成一团老弱多被践踏辗毙
    【新华社淮海前线十八日电】前线记者报导杜聿明匪部三个兵团放弃徐州向萧（县）永（城）路上败逃时的狼狈情形称：徐州十五万国民党匪军加上数万后方机关人员和家属，一逃出徐州城就在解放军的追击下陷入完全混乱的状态。沿途田野、村庄、大小道路挤满了数不尽的人群，大家都争先恐后的拼命向西逃窜。匪军的高级军官们都坐在汽车里抢先逃命。据被俘的杜聿明的警卫营营部司书李文彬谈：杜匪逃出徐州后一直坐在汽车里，一步也不下来，吃饭睡觉都在汽车上，只是拼命催着快逃。混在逃跑行列中的其他徐州“剿总”匪首们一听到解放军追击的炮声，便急忙赶调殿后的十几辆坦克到前面开路，并派一个副官站在当头的一辆坦克上，一面冲撞，一面向拥挤的人马车辆发叫：“我是总司令部的，我是总司令部的，快让开，快让开！”沿途匪军争先抢车。各兵团各机关各部队的汽车、马车、牛车乱碰乱撞，搅成一团。那些跟随匪军高级军官乘车逃跑的太太小姐们个个哭哭啼啼，许多老弱者在混乱中被践踏在足下或被辗毙在道上。
    匪军在逃跑途中，有两次弹药车燃烧爆炸。前面车辆的匪官们都以为解放军追兵已到，顿时慌乱跳车到处乱藏。车上大米白面衣服倾倒满地。匪官的太太们因为赶不上逃军，到处流散，仅萧县东北毛庄就被遗弃有好几百名。奔逃途中的匪军后卫部队更心惊胆战，连作一顿饭吃的时间都没有。
