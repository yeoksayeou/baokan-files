Xinhua News Agency, East China, 11th: Late news from Northern Jiangsu: Huaiyin city, the military and commercial center of Northern Jiangsu with a population of 70,000, was recovered on the morning of the 3rd. The Kuomintang First Pacification Zone Headquarters stationed in the city, along with its subordinate 41st Division of the 51st Army and the 59th Division of the 4th Army, abandoned the city on the evening of the 2nd and retreated south along the Grand Canal to Huai'an. On the following day, the enemy reoccupied Huai'an and continued north, reoccupying Huaiyin. The enemy was met with a head-on blow from the People's Liberation Army near Banzha Town, 18 li south of Huaiyin. After killing and wounding over 400 officers and soldiers, including Wu Zhuangyou (killed), regimental commander of the 177th Regiment of the 59th Division, Rao Yumin (wounded), chief of staff of the division, and Lieutenant Colonel Staff Officer Chen Hongdu (wounded), they retreated to Huai'an on the 5th. Revolutionary order is now being rebuilt in Huaiyin.

Xinhua News Agency, East China, 11th: Workers in factories in Northern Jiangsu are currently supporting the victorious advance of the Huaihai Front with an intense production increase campaign. With the assistance of local women, a military region clothing factory made tens of thousands of sets of cotton-padded clothing in eight days. The output of clothing and shoe factories in the First Sub-district (governing seven counties including Rugao, Taixing, and Dongtai) has doubled compared to before the start of the campaign. A certain military factory completed its original monthly production task in just thirteen days of concentrated effort by the workers. After receiving a new task, workers in several other factories automatically increased their working hours from nine to twelve hours per day. Workers in a certain factory created a new machine for stamping blasting tubes for artillery shells, increasing production by fifteen times. In addition, they developed a method of using shell casings as artillery shell fuses, which not only improved quality but also increased production by more than four times. A certain factory renovated its copper smelting furnace and propellant charging machine, doubling both the copper smelting capacity and the propellant charging speed with the same amount of coke. A certain chemical factory renovated its alcohol distillation apparatus, enabling it to produce alcohol with a concentration of 92% and saving fuel.

    【新华社华东十一日电】苏北各工厂职工，现正以紧张的增产运动，支援淮海前线的胜利进军。军区一个被服厂在当地妇女协助下，八天内制成数万套棉衣。一分区（辖如皋、泰兴、东台等七个县）被服厂和鞋厂，产量均较战役开始前提高了一倍。某军工厂原定一个月的生产任务，经工人十三天突击便完成了。另几个厂在接受一项新任务后，工人自动把工作时间由每天九小时增至十二小时。某厂工人创造了冲炮弹爆炸管的新机器，提高产量达十五倍。另外又研究出以弹壳做炮弹保险，不但质量好，且产量增加四倍以上。某厂改造了熔铜炉及装药冲机，以同量的焦炭，熔铜量及装药速度均增加一倍。某化学工厂改造了酒精蒸溜器，能生产浓度百分之九十二的酒精，并节省了燃料。
