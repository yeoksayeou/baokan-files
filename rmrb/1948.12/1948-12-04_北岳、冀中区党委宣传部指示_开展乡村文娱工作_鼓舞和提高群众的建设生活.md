　　[News from Northern Yue] The Propaganda Department of the Northern Yue Regional Party Committee issued instructions on carrying out rural cultural and artistic work. The first point emphasizes that after the self-defense war, support-the-front work, land reform, party rectification, and production movements in the region, the rural atmosphere is often tense, and the people urgently need cultural entertainment to make appropriate adjustments to their lives and emotions. With the national victory imminent, the people must also use various cultural and artistic activities to encourage and improve themselves to a greater extent in order to welcome a new and constructive life.

    The instructions point out that the widespread village drama troupe activities in the past have achieved certain results in boosting the morale of the masses and raising their awareness, but some deviations have also occurred. For example, the village drama troupes became detached from the masses, delayed production, wasted village funds, developed a style of large-scale troupes, and performed bad scripts and lyrics containing feudal toxins and vulgar tastes. Last year, some places stopped village drama troupe activities indiscriminately, which led to the indiscriminate performance of old dramas without criticism, which was wrong.

    The instructions point out that the future direction of rural cultural and artistic work is to organize and lead rural cultural and recreational activities and guide the people's lives and emotions to develop in the correct and healthy direction.

    The instructions propose: to organize various cultural and recreational gatherings for the masses (such as martial arts gatherings, stilt walking, temple fairs...), various professional artists, through village drama troupes and rural amateur theatrical groups. Therefore, the cancellation, restoration, and establishment of village drama troupes should be carried out cautiously based on specific circumstances and the requirements of the masses; focus on cultivating certain central village drama troupes to prevent repeating past mistakes and phenomena such as actors' non-compliance with combat readiness and opposition to village work. Make the village drama troupe not only an organization for cultural and recreational activities, but also an organization for mass learning.

    Regarding the content of the performances, the instructions point out that lively and joyful scripts, Yangko dances, and dramas with healthy emotions should be selected, such as "Brother and Sister Reclaiming Wasteland," "Bao Shan Joins the Army," "Living a Good Life," and "Issuing Land Certificates." Old scripts should be approached with a critical and transformative attitude. Modified scripts such as "Three Attacks on Zhujiazhuang," "Forced to Join Liangshan," and "Li Zicheng" can be performed. Good old scripts such as "Fishing and Killing Home" can also be performed. Those that are feudal and vulgar are prohibited. But the main thing is to encourage the creation and modification of old dramas. Therefore, all localities should investigate professional drama troupes, amateur theatrical groups, and professional artists (storytellers, peep shows, hurdy-gurdy players), and convene their负责人 (responsible persons) or main actors to hold座谈会 (symposiums) and training courses to explain the Party's literary and artistic policies, understand their performance situation, review the repertoire, determine which ones can be performed, which ones are prohibited, and which ones can be performed after modification, and provide specific assistance to help them improve, and introduce them to modified scripts to solve their practical difficulties in choreography and performance in order to encourage them to create new ones and transform old ones, and serve the new democratic culture.

    The instructions finally stipulate that the organization, leadership, review, and training of the above work should be reported level by level, and good creations should be promoted.

    [News from Central Hebei] The Propaganda Department of the Central Hebei Regional Party Committee issued supplementary instructions on cultural and artistic work for this winter and next spring (instructions were issued on October 2). The instructions point out that the prevalence of old folk operas after the autumn harvest shows that the people need entertainment, but the supply of new art and literature cannot meet the demand, which greatly limits the improvement of the people's new ideas and new feelings. In order to develop new art and literature, it is stipulated that commercial performances of old operas will be subject to business tax; however, amateur theatrical groups performing high platforms and new programs (with new life as content), with more than half of the performances being new, may not be subject to donations. Entertainment donation taxes will be collected by the local industry and commerce bureau and handed over to the civil education organs to be used as rewards for new art and literature.

    At the same time, in-service cadres or teachers who are not professionals but have writing ability should be helped to draw up writing plans, and the leadership should provide convenience for creation. The propaganda departments of local and county party committees must pay close attention to organizing forces and reflecting reality in a timely manner. Before the Spring Festival, efforts must be made to obtain a large number of cultural and recreational materials suitable for both new and old forms to meet the needs of the masses. In order to strengthen guidance on rural art work, the Central Hebei Guide has added a rural art supplement to exchange experiences, guide rural art activities, and provide short performance materials.

　　北岳、冀中区党委宣传部指示
  　开展乡村文娱工作
    鼓舞和提高群众的建设生活
    【北岳讯】北岳区党委宣传部发出关于开展乡村文艺工作的指示，首项指出该区经过自卫战争、支前工作及土改整党生产等运动，农村空气经常紧张，人民生活情绪迫切需要文化娱乐，以作适当的调剂。而全国胜利在即，人民为了迎接新的、建设的生活，亦必须通过各种文艺活动，予以更广泛的鼓舞和提高。
    指出过去普遍的村剧团活动，在鼓舞群众情绪、提高群众觉悟上是有一定成绩的，但也发生了一些偏向，如村剧团的脱离群众，耽误生产，浪费村款，大剧团化作风，以及演唱含有封建毒素低级趣味的不良剧本唱词等，去年某些地方不加区别的停止村剧团活动，以致以后发展了无批判的滥演旧剧，都是错误的。
    指出今后乡村文艺工作的方向，是组织与领导乡村文娱活动，引导着群众的生活与情绪向正确的与健康的方向发展。
    指示提出：通过村剧团、乡村子弟班，组织群众各种文娱集会（如武会、高跷、庙会……）、各种职业艺人，因之，对村剧团的取消、恢复与建立，要根据具体情况与群众要求慎重地进行；有重点地培养某些中心村剧团，防止重犯过去错误及演员的不服战勤与村工作对立等现象。使村剧团不仅成为文娱活动的组织，而且成为群众学习的组织。
    在演唱的内容上，指出要选取活泼愉快情感健康的剧本、秧歌、话剧，如“兄妹开荒”、“宝山参军”、“过光景”、“发土地证”等；对旧戏本，要采取批判与改造的态度，已改造的剧本如“三打祝家庄”、“逼上梁山”、“李自成”等；旧有好的如“打渔杀家”之类也可以演；禁止那些封建的低级的。但更主要的是鼓励创作与修改旧剧，因之，各地要调查职业剧团、子弟班、职业艺人（说书、拉洋片、打洋琴的），召集其负责人或主要演员开座谈会、训练班，说明党的文艺政策，了解他们演出的情况，审查剧目，确定那些可演，那些禁演，那些修改后可以演，具体的帮助他们提高，并给他们介绍经过改造的剧本，解决他们编排演出的实际困难，以鼓励他们创造新的与改造旧的，为新民主主义的文化服务。
    指示最后规定以上工作的组织、领导、审查、训练等情形，要递级汇报，好的创作要予以推广。
    【冀中讯】冀中区党委宣传部，关于今冬明春文艺工作，发出补充指示（按十月二日已发过指示）。指出：秋后民间旧戏盛行，说明人民需要娱乐，而新文艺供不应求，这使人民民的新思想新感情的提高受极大限制。为发展新文艺，规定：营业性的唱旧戏，一律课以营业税；但子弟班唱高台、新节目（以新生活为内容）每开箱超过半数者，可不上捐。娱乐捐税由当地工商局征收后，全部交民教机关掌握，为奖励新文艺之用。
    同时，对非专业而有写作能力的在职干部或教员，应帮助其订出写作计划，领导上给以创作方便，各地、县党委宣传部要切实注意组织力量，以及时的反映现实。在春节前必须争取大量的适合新旧形式的文娱材料涌现，以应群众需要。为加强指导乡艺工作，冀中导报增设乡艺副刊，以交流经验，指导乡艺活动，并供给短小的演唱材料。
