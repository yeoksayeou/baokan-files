Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, December 14th: TASS reports: December 5th marked the twelfth anniversary of the adoption of the new Soviet Constitution. On that day, the newspaper Izvestia published a special article by Professor Denisov, discussing the historical significance of the Soviet Constitution to the world. It stated:

　　Stalin's Constitution is the greatest document of our era. It has transformed the dreams embraced by the kindest and most progressive minds of mankind for centuries, the dreams that hundreds of millions of working people and the oppressed around the world still hold today, into unrepealable laws. Stalin's Constitution is a document that proves that the socialist system that has been realized in the Soviet Union can also be established in other countries. That is why the Soviet Constitution, as Comrade Stalin pointed out, represents a program of action for the people of capitalist countries and a guiding star in their struggle against reactionaries and for the realization of people's democracy.

　　The great victory of the Soviet people over fascist Germany brilliantly confirmed Comrade Stalin's prediction that socialism and democracy are invincible and that the Soviet Constitution would be an indictment against fascism. The Soviet Union, as a socialist state of workers and peasants and as a voluntary alliance of equal nations perfected by the Stalin Constitution, inspires all progressive humanity to carry out the movement for liberation against capitalist rule, against political, economic, and spiritual enslavement, and against imperialism and reactionaries. As an unwavering democratic country, the Soviet Union is a strong and solid fortress of the great democratic camp that opposes the camp of imperialism and reactionaries. The Soviet Union heroically exposes the instigators of new wars, is the guardian of peace, and is the pioneer of friendship among the peoples of all nations.

　　The great ideas embodied in the Stalin Constitution have become a factor of revolution and mobilization with worldwide historical significance. This idea has found and continues to find thousands upon thousands of new believers around the world. This idea has greatly influenced the development of people's democratic countries, which, inspired by the Soviet example, have forever ended anti-popular bourgeois regimes and embarked on the path of transition to socialism.

　　The Soviet leader, in the anti-imperialist democratic camp, makes this camp deeply believe that its strength is superior to that of the imperialist camp. That is why all freedom-loving people in the world are extremely concerned about the further consolidation and prosperity of the Soviet Union. That is why they today join us in praising our Soviet Constitution and its creator - the great Stalin, whose name has become an invincible symbol of socialism and true democratic principles.

　　The Stalin Constitution is the fruit of the Soviet people's struggle, the fruit of their victory in the war for human liberation. This constitution spiritually arms us, strengthens our belief in our power, and mobilizes us to fight for new victories on the road to communism.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, December 14th: TASS reports: The people of the new democracies in Eastern Europe are enthusiastically celebrating the twelfth anniversary of Stalin's new constitution. In Romania, the Romanian-Soviet Friendship Association held a grand commemorative meeting on December 4th. Romanian Prime Minister Groza, Chairman of the Presidium of the Romanian National Assembly, Backhun, and diplomatic envoys from the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, Albania and other countries attended. Romanian Minister of Justice Bunaciu delivered a report to the conference entitled "Stalin's Constitution - the Most Progressive Constitution in the World." The conference also sent a telegram to Stalin to congratulate him. Similar meetings were held in factories in the Romanian capital and other towns. On December 5th, newspapers in Poland, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, and other countries published commemorative articles in prominent positions. The editorial of the Polish Workers' Party newspaper "People's Voice" pointed out: "Stalin's Constitution is the main document pointing out the path for mankind to reach a beautiful future. That is why the Soviet Constitution is a holiday for all working people." The Bulgarian Izgrev newspaper pointed out: This constitution provides all progressive mankind with a spiritual weapon and real support in their struggle for lasting peace and national independence. The Czech Armed Forces newspaper "Obrana Lidu" stated: The democratic nature of the Stalin Constitution cannot be compared to any other constitution in the world.

　　斯大林新宪法光耀世界
  　指引民主人民奋勇前进
    东欧各国热烈庆祝苏联新宪法纪念
    【新华社陕北十四日电】塔斯社讯：十二月五日为苏联通过新宪法的十二周年纪念。消息报是日发表捷尼索夫教授的专文，论述苏联宪法在全世界的历史意义。内称：
    斯大林宪法是我们这一时代最伟大的文献。它已把人类百年来最善良、最进步的心灵所怀抱的梦想、全世界千百万劳动人民与被压迫者直到今天还保持着的梦想，变成了废止不了的法律。斯大林宪法是一个这样的文献，它证明已在苏联实现的社会主义制度，同样可以在其他国家建立起来。这就是为什么苏联宪法，象斯大林同志所指出的那样，代表着资本主义各国人民行动的纲领，而且是他们在反对反动派、实现人民民主斗争中的一颗北极星。
    苏维埃人民战胜法西斯德国的伟大胜利，辉煌地证实了斯大林同志的预言，即社会主义与民主是无敌的，苏联的宪法将是对法西斯主义的起诉书。苏联，作为工农的社会主义国家，并作为因斯大林宪法而臻于完美的各平等民族自愿的联盟，鼓舞着一切进步人类进行反对资本统治、反对政治经济与精神奴役、反对帝国主义及反动派的争取解放的运动。作为始终不渝的民主国家的苏联，是与帝国主义及反动派的阵营相对抗的伟大民主阵营的强大坚固堡垒。苏联英勇地揭露着新战争的挑拨者，她是和平的卫士，是各民族人民友谊的先锋。
    斯大林宪法所体现的伟大思想，已经成为具有全世界历史意义的促进革命与动员的因素。这个思想过去和现在在世界各地都不断找到千千万万的新的信仰者。这个思想大大影响了人民民主国家的发展，这些国家受到苏联范例的启示，已永远地结束了反人民的资产阶级政权，走上向社会主义转变的道路。
    苏联领导者反帝的民主阵营，使这一阵营深信自己的力量优越于帝国主义阵营的力量。这便是为什么世界各国一切爱好自由的人民极其关切苏联进一步巩固与繁荣的原因。这便是为什么他们今天与我们同声颂扬我们的苏维埃宪法及其缔造者——伟大的斯大林，他的名字已成为社会主义与真正民主原则所向无敌的象征。
    斯大林宪法是苏维埃人民斗争的果实，是他们在为人类解放的战争中所获得的胜利果实，这个宪法在精神上武装着我们，加强着对我们威力的信念，并动员我们在走向共产主义的途中进行斗争以取得新的胜利。
    【新华社陕北十四日电】塔斯社讯：东欧各新民主主义国家人民热烈庆祝斯大林新宪法十二周年纪念。在罗马尼亚，罗苏友好协会于十二月四日举行盛大纪念会，罗总理格罗查，罗国民议会主席团主席巴克洪与苏、捷、保、阿等各国外交使节均出席。罗司法部长布纳西乌以“斯大林宪法——世界上最进步的宪法”为题向大会作报告。大会并致电斯大林祝贺。罗马尼亚首都与各城镇的工厂中，都举行了同样的会议。十二月五日，波、保、捷等国报纸都以显著地位刊出纪念专文。波兰工人党机关报“人民呼声”报社论指出：“斯大林宪法是指明人类达到美妙的未来道路的主要文献，这就是苏联宪法即为何是一切劳动人民的节日的原因。”保加利亚伊兹格列夫报指出：这一宪法给一切进步人类在他们争取持久和平与民族独立的斗争中提供了一种精神的武器和真正的支持。捷克武装部队机关报“奥布拉纳·毕都”报称：斯大林宪法的民主性质，在世界上没有任何其他宪法可以和它相比拟。
