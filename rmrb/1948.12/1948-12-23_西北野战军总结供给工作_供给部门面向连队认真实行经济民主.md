Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 21st - The Northwest Field Army recently held a supply conference to discuss in detail how to improve the army's supply work. Liu Jingfan, Vice Chairman of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Government and Commander of the Field Army's Logistics Department, made a summary. The summary pointed out that to do a good job in the Field Army's supply work, it is first necessary to conscientiously establish a unified revenue and expenditure financial system, and thoroughly overcome departmentalism, individualism, and anarchic undisciplined states in the supply departments. To this end, all income, such as battlefield seizures, reception of enemy and puppet materials, and borrowing in new areas, should be turned over to the public. The old household property of all departments of the Field Army should also be transferred to the logistics supply organs. All expenditures should first ensure the necessary expenses for eating, clothing, and combat. Other expenses should be handled according to their importance and urgency, and efforts should be made to save as much as possible.

Regarding the supply of food and grass in the new area operations, the summary pointed out that in the new areas where the people's political power has not been established, efforts should be made to supply the troops with the enemy's grain and fodder. If this is insufficient, first borrow from large and middle landlords. If still insufficient, borrow from small landlords. If still insufficient, borrow from wealthy peasants. Only as a last resort, borrow from well-to-do middle peasants. Generally, no borrowing from middle peasants and below. When there are special difficulties with grain, the Logistics Department of the Field Army will make unified plans. In areas where grain and grass are borrowed in advance, it is necessary to deeply publicize the policy of reasonable burden and the meaning and standards of advance borrowing to people of all classes, so as to avoid their suspicion or panic. At the same time, conduct specific and realistic investigations and research on the economic conditions of the borrowing households. Organize evaluation meetings with the township or village as a unit to evaluate the class or the amount to be borrowed. However, there must be leadership to prevent bias. In order to ensure the supply of military grain for the entire army, grain procurement work must be under unified leadership, with plans, steps, organization, and systems. For this reason, the grain production situation in the areas where the troops are going and the grain storage situation of all classes should be investigated in advance, and the grain procurement areas should be specifically designated for each unit, and grain procurement tasks should be assigned. After borrowing in advance, a pre-borrowing certificate must be issued as proof.

The summary pointed out that the quality of the company's supply work is the standard for checking whether the supply department has a service perspective for soldiers and the masses. The supply department should face the company, and its work focus should be on the soldiers, and do a good job in all supply work for the soldiers. The company must conscientiously implement economic democracy. Soldiers have the right to enjoy the treatment that soldiers should enjoy according to the supply standards, and soldiers have the right to check expenditures beyond the standards. The company's Economic Committee should report its work and the company's food account to the entire company at the end of each month, mobilize soldiers to review, and formulate a plan for the next month for the committee to implement. The regiment's supply department or the agency's supply department or management section should conscientiously strengthen the leadership of the company's or agency's supply work, and help each company establish a supply system and daily work. In order to overcome the difficulty of the platoon leader in charge of management keeping accounts in the company, it is stipulated that the clerk兼会计兼 accountant, and the quartermaster is changed to the management platoon leader to increase his authority. In order to train company supply personnel, attention should be paid to organizing the study of management platoon leaders, accountants, cooks班长班长, cooks, porters, etc., to improve their political culture and professional knowledge. They should be led to review their work regularly, summarize their experiences, reward models, and correct shortcomings in order to improve their work ability, and improve their work enthusiasm and responsibility.

　　西北野战军总结供给工作
    供给部门面向连队认真实行经济民主
    【新华社延安二十一日电】西北野战军最近召开的供给会议，对如何改进全军的供给工作，曾进行了详尽的讨论，并由陕甘宁边区政府副主席兼野战军后勤司令员刘景范作出总结。该总结指出：要做好野战军的供给工作，首先应认真建立统筹统支的财政制度，彻底克服供给部门中的本位主义、个人主义及无政府无纪律状态。为此必须将一切收入如战场缴获、接收敌伪物资、新区征借等收入等全部归公。野战军各部旧存的家务亦应全部移交后勤供给机关。一切开支应首先保证吃饭穿衣和作战必需之费用，其他费用应分别轻重缓急，尽力节省。
    关于新区作战中的粮草供应问题，总结指出在人民政权未建立的新区，应坚决争取以敌人的粮食草料供给部队需要。不足时首先向大地主、中等地主预借，仍不足时向小地主预借，再不足时向富农预借，万不得已时，才向富裕中农预借。中农以下一般不能预借。在粮食特殊困难时，则由野战军后勤司令部统一筹划。在预借粮草的地区，必须向各阶层人民深入宣传合理负担政策和预借意义、标准等，以免他们怀疑或恐慌。同时要具体地实事求是地调查研究预借户的经济状况，以乡或村为单位，组织评议会，评定阶级或应借数目。但须有领导，防止发生偏向。为保证全军军粮供应，筹粮工作必须统一领导，有计划、有步骤、有组织、有制度地进行。为此，应预先调查部队所到地区的粮产情况及各阶层存粮情况，并应将各部队筹粮地区具体划定，给予筹粮任务。在预借后须开给预借证，以作证明。
    总结指出：连队供给工作的好坏，就是检查供给部门有无为士兵群众服务观点的标准。供给部门应面向连队，其工作重心应放在战士身上，切实做好战士的一切供给工作。连队必须认真实行经济民主。凡按供给标准规定战士应享受的待遇，战士有权享受，标准以外的开支，战士有权检查。连队经济委员会应将自己的工作及连队伙食帐目，于每月月终向全连报告，发动战士检讨，并订出下月计划，交该会执行。团的供给处或机关供给处或管理科，要认真加强连队或机关供给工作的领导，帮助各连建立供给制度与日常工作。为克服连队管理排长记帐的困难，规定文书兼会计，改司务长为管理排长，提高其权限。为了培养连队供给人员，应当注意组织管理排长、会计、伙夫班长、伙夫、挑夫等的学习，提高他们的政治文化与业务知识。应当领导他们按期检讨工作，总结经验，奖励模范，纠正缺点，以便提高他们的工作能力，提高他们的工作积极性与责任心。
