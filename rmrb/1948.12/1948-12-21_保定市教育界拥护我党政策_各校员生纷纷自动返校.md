[Jizhong Dispatch] Baoding Education Circle Supports Our Party's Policies; Students and Faculty of All Schools Voluntarily Return to School
    After the liberation of Baoding City, the Military Control Commission actively resumed school education. Most of the public and private schools in the city have now reopened. Before the liberation of the city, the bandit Liu Hwa-nan had carried out large-scale destruction of school buildings in the city (including the Hebei Provincial Medical College and thirteen middle schools in the city), and used deception and threats to kidnap more than 1,000 faculty and staff. The school buildings of Provincial Medical College, Yuzhong, Girls' Normal School, Sichun, and Yude were burned or demolished by the bandit Liu, resulting in heavy losses. Only one large building remained in Baoding City, and it was also burned to the ground. The loss of books, instruments, and other equipment in the schools was even more serious. According to incomplete statistics from eleven middle schools, including Sichun, Baoding Normal School, and Baoding Middle School, a total of 37,000 books, 950 instruments, 469 kinds of medicines, 13 pianos and harmoniums, 348 shi of grain, 4,800 sets of desks and chairs, and countless other equipment were lost. A greater number of public and private primary schools suffered damage. In addition, before fleeing, the bandit Liu shot and killed one student, wounded six, and arrested many faculty members and students, whose whereabouts are still unknown. After the city's liberation on the 22nd of last month, the Military Control Commission sent personnel to visit people in the education circle in the city, explained our Party's policies of protecting culture and education and treating intellectuals, and asked them to inform their acquaintances among the faculty and staff to return to their original schools and start restoring work. On the 24th, it convened a symposium of faculty and staff from thirteen middle schools in the city, and decided to temporarily resume classes jointly. A preparatory committee for the resumption of classes was immediately formed. After several days of efforts, classes were resumed on the 26th. By the 7th of this month, the number of students had reached more than 720, and the number of faculty and staff had increased to more than 50. Plans are now underway to separate boys' and girls' schools and establish a normal school. All thirty-one of the city's thirty-four public and private primary schools, except for three outside the city, have now reopened. As of the 3rd of this month, the total number of students has reached more than 4,700, accounting for 54% of the total number of students before liberation. The number of faculty and staff has reached more than 140, accounting for 60% of the total number of faculty and staff before liberation. Peiying and other primary schools that had been closed during the enemy occupation are now also preparing to resume operations. The faculty members and students who were kidnapped by the enemy, unable to bear the abuse of the bandit army (some have been forced to join the army), are now escaping back one after another. Bian Jing, a student of Tongren Middle School, and Zhang Shugu, a student of Baoding Normal School, said after returning: "Five yuan of puppet gold yuan coupons are given every day, which can only buy a few wowotou to fill our stomachs. Everyone is crying and weeping. Who doesn't want to come back!" Dong Hongchou, a student of Baoding Middle School, ran back and said: "When we were staying in the south of Xushui City, they locked ten of us in a shed. We were cold and hungry. We really hate Liu Hwa-nan!" They were very excited when they came back and saw that the school had already resumed classes. After the faculty and staff of the schools returned to their posts, the Military Control Commission temporarily lent part of their December salaries to solve their living difficulties. After the salary was paid, Mr. Zhang Chunhe, a teacher, said: "Before they (referring to the Chiang bandits) ran away, the additional adjustment payment slips for the three months since September of this year had already been submitted, but they all went into their pockets!" The school workers were even more active and recovered many lost school supplies. The Girls' Normal School alone recovered seven microscopes. Due to the correct implementation of our Party's policies, the faculty and staff of the schools and the citizens highly praised it.

[Jizhong Dispatch] The famous "Lotus Pond Academy" scenic spot in Baoding City, Hebei Province, has been officially opened after active rectification by the democratic government. Many people have been visiting it in recent days. According to legend, the academy was the villa of Zhang Rou, the governor of Shuntian Road in the Yuan Dynasty, and was built at the same time as the city wall of Baoding. During the Kangxi and Qianlong years of the Qing Dynasty, it was used as a temporary palace. It was not until the beginning of the Yongzheng period that it was changed to a "academy." The entire courtyard covers an area of ​​more than 50 mu, and the lotus pond covers an area of ​​8 to 9 mu. In summer, the lotus flowers are in full bloom and the fragrance fills the courtyard. The southwest part of the courtyard is a museum, which houses many antiques. The southeast part has a library with a collection of more than 100,000 books, including various ancient rare books of classics, history, philosophy, and literature. The Rare Books Room alone has 20,000 precious printed volumes. Before the liberation of the city, the Chiang Kai-shek and Fu Zuoyi bandit gangs robbed some of the furniture and sundries from the Youth Hall and demolished six houses in this cultural relic scenic spot. After the People's Liberation Army entered the city, it provided all-round protection to the various cultural relics and historical sites of Lotus Pond, and the People's Government actively repaired the damaged houses, doors, and windows. The "Academy" library has been open for more than half a month, and many books and newspapers published in the liberated areas have been added to the library. Many people go there to read every day. Mr. Chen Zhenjiu and Mr. Zhang Zuwang, who have been working in the museum for 30 years, are still serving in the museum in their original positions.

　　保定市教育界拥护我党政策
    各校员生纷纷自动返校
    【冀中电】保定市解放后，管制委员会即积极恢复学校教育，现市内各公私立学校已大部开课。该市解放前，刘匪化南曾对该市学校建设（包括河北省医学院及全市十三所中学）进行了大规模的破坏，并用欺骗威胁手段裹走教职员达千余人。省立医学院、育中、女师、四存、育德等校被刘匪烧毁或拆毁校舍很多。保市仅存一座大楼，也被付之一炬。各校图书、仪器及其他设备，损失更重。据四存、保师、保中等十一中学不完整统计，共损失图书三万七千册，仪器九百五十件，药品四百六十九种，钢琴、风琴十三具，粮食三百四十八石，桌椅四千八百套，其他用具无算。各公私立小学惨遭破坏者为数更多。此外，刘匪逃窜前，曾枪杀学生一人，击伤六人，并逮捕不少教职学员，至今生死不明。上月二十二日该市解放后，军管会即派员访问市内教育界人士，说明我党保护文化教育及对待知识分子的政策，请他们通知相识教职员，返回原校着手恢复工作。二十四日，又召集全市十三所中学教职员座谈会，决定暂时联合复课，当即组成复课筹备委员会，经数日努力，二十六日即行开课，至本月七日止，学生已达七百二十余人，教职员增至五十余人。现正计划男女分校，并成立一师范学校。全市三十四所公私立小学，除城外三所，其余三十一所现已全部开课。截至本月三日，学生总数已达四千七百余人，占解放前学生总数百分之五十四。教职员已达百四十余，占解放前教职员总数百分之六十。敌占时已停闭之培英等小学，现亦准备恢复。被敌裹走的教职学员，因不堪匪军虐待（一部分已被强迫当兵），现正陆续逃回。同仁中学学生边静、保师学生张述古回来后说：“每天给五元伪金元券，只能买几个窝窝头充饥，大家哭哭啼啼，谁不想回来呀！”保中学生董洪畴跑回来说：“宿在徐水城南时，把俺十个人关在一个草棚里，又冷又饿，提起刘化南来真恨死人！”他们回来后，见学校早已复课，异常兴奋。各校教职员复职后，军管会为解决他们的生活困难，已将十二月份薪金暂借给一部。发薪后，教师张春合先生说：“他们（指蒋匪）没跑前，今年九月以来三个月的追加调整支付书早已上来，但都入了他们的腰包了！”各校校役们更加积极，又追回很多丢失的校具。仅女师一校，即追回显微镜七架。由于我党政策之正确贯彻，各校教职员及市民极为赞许。
    【冀中电】河北省驰名的保定市名胜“莲花池书院”，经民主政府积极整顿，现已正式开放；连日游览者颇多。该院相传为元代顺天路都督张柔之别墅，与保定城垣同时修筑。清康熙、乾隆年间曾设为行宫，至雍正初年始改为“书院”。全院面积五十多亩，莲池占地八九亩，入夏荷花盛放清香满院。院之西南部为博物馆，内藏古玩颇多。东南部有图书馆，藏书达十万册以上，包括经、史、子、集各种古籍珍本，只善本室就有珍贵刊本二万余册。该市解放前，蒋傅匪帮对此文物名胜，曾抢走青年馆之家具杂物一部，并拆毁房屋六间。解放军入城后，对莲池各种文物古迹，从多方予以保护，人民政府并积极修复被破坏之房舍、门窗等建筑。现该“书院”图书馆已开放半月余，馆内增加了不少解放区出版的图书、报纸，每天前往阅览者颇多。在该馆服务达三十年之陈臻久、张祖望两先生，仍原职在馆内服务。
