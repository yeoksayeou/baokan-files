　　Yangquan Iron Foundry Industry Plans to Increase Production
  　Aiming to Restore Pre-War Levels by the End of Next Year.
    Key Lies in Strengthening Leadership, Accumulating Capital, and Improving Technology
    [Our Newspaper's Report] Our newspaper reporters Lü Guangming and Bu Ke report: With the assistance of the government and the Promotion Society, the iron foundry industry in Yangquan City has developed greatly over the past year. Based on the current development situation, the city's municipal party committee has drafted a specific plan, predicting that by the end of next year, the annual output can be increased to pre-war levels. The city's iron foundry industry started in the Ming Dynasty. After the opening of the Zhengtai Railway in the late Qing Dynasty, transportation became convenient, and the private iron foundry industry developed more rapidly. Before 1936 and 1937, the annual output of the city's iron foundry industry reached more than 20,000 tons, selling well in North China, Northeast China, and Inner Mongolia. In particular, the large hoe blades and large pots for boiling saltpeter and salt produced in the area were most popular among the masses.

    After the July 7th Incident, due to the division and blockade by the Japanese invaders, finished products could not be sold. The Japanese invaders, in order to plunder raw materials for military supplies, only allowed the city's iron foundries to produce pig iron and cast iron plates, which they bought by the catty. After the Japanese surrender, the Yan bandit implemented a policy of "combining soldiers and farmers" here, engaging in frenzied plunder. Therefore, most of the iron foundry industry collapsed in the past ten years. By the time of the Zhengtai Campaign when the city was liberated last year, the annual output of the city's iron foundry industry had fallen to 4,000 tons, only 20% of the pre-war level. After our army liberated the area, with the support of the government and the Promotion Society providing grain as shares, and the Baoxingheng Public-Private Coal and Iron Store setting prices in advance, plus some of the fruits of the land reform victory as capital, the city's iron foundry industry gradually recovered and rebuilt. According to recent statistics, the number of raw and wrought iron furnaces in the area has increased to 492 (excluding coking furnaces and stir-frying furnaces), with an annual output of 17,310 tons. Since the North and South Liberated Areas were connected into one piece and the Shide Railway was opened to traffic, iron goods have been selling well. Currently, the production of ironware cannot meet the demand.

    In order to implement the policy of restoring and developing industrial production, the municipal party committee recently decided on the rectification policy for the private iron foundry industry. It also jointly formulated the annual iron foundry industry production plan for 1949 with the municipal government, the Bureau of Industry and Commerce, the bank, and the Baoxingheng Coal and Iron Store. The plan, after mentioning that preliminary improvements and some achievements have been made in iron foundry production in the past five months due to the implementation of the spirit of the North China Industry and Commerce Conference, points out that there are still many serious problems in business management: (1) Cooperative iron foundries generally lack funds, and almost all rely on the public-private stores' advance ordering, some production grain loans, and the fruits of the land reform victory to maintain production. The reason is that in the past, they did not pay attention to accumulating funds. The workers and cooperative members divided all the production profits, lacking a developmental perspective. (2) The economic system of the iron foundries is chaotic, the procedures are unclear, and the corruption and waste of management personnel are quite common. There are many non-production-related additional expenses in the furnaces, which put the workers and cooperative members at a great disadvantage. In addition, the masses do not yet understand the benefits of cooperative production and still have the idea of simply relying on public assistance. Therefore, there are still many difficulties in terms of capital turnover, technological improvement, and increased output. (3) A unified cooperative organization leadership has not yet been established. It is difficult for these hundreds of iron furnaces scattered in dozens of villages to get on the right track without the specific organizational leadership and business leadership of the cooperative system. In addition, our cadres lack experience in industrial production and are not good at using cooperative forms to organize, unite, and assist small producers in production. Therefore, in production leadership, they have shown slackness, weakness, and great blindness.

    Based on the above situation, the proposed improvement measures are: (1) In terms of leadership, before the establishment of the Yangquan City Cooperative General Society, the City Production Promotion Society and the public-private Baoxingheng Coal and Iron Store will be merged, with a production guidance department set up to organize and support the production of cooperative iron furnaces and handle supply and sales as the main business, and cadres will be sent to establish and improve the basic organizations of the cooperative. (2) In terms of funding, first of all, funds should be accumulated regularly and gradually in the process of cooperative management obtaining profits, and credit cooperation should be tried out. Banks and Baoxingheng Coal and Iron Store will continue to provide loans and advance orders to solve funding difficulties. (3) Regarding the issue of improving production tools and increasing production efficiency, it is planned to request the government to allocate a batch of grain loans and focus on converting some of the earthen furnaces into semi-mechanized fan furnaces to replace the earthen method of smelting iron. The following is the city's specific plan for increasing iron foundry production in 1949: (1) Convert one-quarter of the city's 205 pig iron furnaces, i.e., 51 furnaces, into 17 fan-blast furnaces. According to the original daily iron smelting capacity of 1,767 catties for three earthen furnaces, each fan-blast furnace can smelt more than 2,000 catties of iron per day. Based on this, each fan-blast furnace is equivalent to the role of three earthen furnaces, and 233 more catties of molten iron can be produced per day. Seventeen furnaces can increase the production of 2.36 tons of molten iron per day (calculated at approximately 2,000 catties per ton – editor), and 566 tons can be produced throughout the year for eight months. The remaining 154 earthen furnaces will have the volume of the original furnace trenches expanded, from 63 crucibles per trench to 70 crucibles, and the crucible body will also be enlarged. Each trench can increase the melting of 56 catties of molten iron, so 5.13 tons of molten iron can be increased per day, and 1,231.2 tons of iron goods can be produced for eight months throughout the year. (2) Draw one-fifth of the technical workers from ×× furnace (and recruit some apprentices to fill the vacancies). Increase 20 earthen furnaces within one year, and 1,262 tons of iron goods can be produced in six months. (3) Plan to convert two-thirds of the 38 casting iron kettles and handle-pot furnaces into barrel-pot furnaces within one year. (4) It is estimated that the six-disc waterwheel furnace can be increased to eleven discs next year, which can produce 704 waterwheels throughout the year, i.e., an actual increase of 80 tons of iron goods. (5) The city originally had 287 wrought iron furnace yards (a total of 1,001 fires). About one-fifth of the fires are produced by technical workers in partnership. The method of recruiting apprentices by teachers can be used to organize scattered workers, which can increase 200 fires, and 4,000 catties of iron goods can be produced per day. Calculated on the basis of eight months, 571.2 tons of iron goods can be increased. The large pot pieces, which are most popular in various places, can only produce 200,000 pieces under the existing conditions. Next year, it is planned to increase the production of another 100,000 pieces, an increase of about 75 tons.

    If the above-mentioned production increase plans can be completed, by the end of next year, the annual output can be increased from 17,310 tons to 21,095.4 tons, which can be restored to the pre-war level, with an actual increase of 3,785.4 tons of iron goods. In order to achieve the above objectives, the city is conducting technical experiments such as investigation and research, melting iron ore with fan-blast furnaces, and improving pot molds.

　　阳泉铁炉业计划增产
  　明年底恢复战前水平
    关键在加强领导积累资本改进技术
    【本报讯】本报记者吕光明、布克报导：阳泉市的铁炉业，经政府及推进社的扶助，一年来有很大发展，该市市委根据目前发展情况，拟出具体计划，预计明年年底，能将年产量提高到战前水平。该市铁炉业自明代开始，至清末正太路通车后，运输方便，民营铁炉业愈趋发展，民国二十五、六年前，该地铁炉业年产量达两万余吨。畅销华北东北及内蒙各地。特别是该地所产之大锄片、熬硝、熬盐之大锅，最受群众欢迎。
    七七事变后，受日寇的分割封锁，成品无法销售，日寇为掠夺军火原料，只允该地铁炉焖生铁、铸铁板，论斤收买。日本投降后，阎匪又在此地实行过“兵农合一”的疯狂掠夺政策，故近十年来铁炉业大部垮台，至去年正太战役该市解放时，该地铁炉业年产量已降跌到四千吨，仅及战前水平的百分之二十。我军解放后，经政府、推进社贷粮入股，宝兴亨公营煤铁店预价定货的扶植，加上一部分土改胜利果实作为资本，使该地铁炉业又逐渐恢复与重建起来。据最近统计，该地生熟铁炉已增至四九二座（焖炉、炒炉未计），年产量达一七、三一○吨。自南北解放区联成一片与石德线通车以后，铁货畅销，现铁器的生产已感到供不应求。
    市委为贯彻恢复与发展工业生产方针，最近决定了民营铁炉业的整顿方针。并与市府、工商局、银行、宝兴亨煤铁店共同拟具一九四九年度的全年铁炉业生产计划。该计划在述及最近五个月来由于贯彻了华北工商会议的精神，在铁炉生产上已获得初步改进及若干成绩以后，指出目前在经营管理方面仍存有许多严重问题：（一）合作铁炉普遍缺乏资金，几乎全部依靠公营商店的预价定货、一部分生产贷粮及土改胜利果实来维持生产。原因是过去不注意积累资金，每期生产利润，工人、社员全部分光，缺乏发展观点。（二）铁炉经济制度紊乱，手续不清，经营管理人员的贪污浪费相当普遍。炉上非生产性质的额外开支很多。使工人、社员吃亏很大。加以群众目前还不了解合作生产的好处，还存在单纯依赖公家扶助的思想，故资金周转、改良技术、提高产量各方面，还存在着很多困难。（三）统一的合作社组织领导尚未建立起来。这分散在几十个村的几百座铁炉，没有合作社系统的具体组织领导与业务领导，是很难走上正规的。加上我们干部缺乏工业生产的经验，不善于利用合作形式组织团结与扶助小生产者进行生产，因之在生产领导上，表现了松懈无力，盲目性很大。
    根据上述情况，拟定改进办法为：（一）领导问题上，阳泉市合作社总社未成立前，先将市生产推进社与公营宝兴亨煤铁店合并起来，内设生产指导部，以组织与扶植合作铁炉生产与办理供销为主要业务，并派出干部建立与健全合作社的基层组织。（二）资金问题上，首先应在合作经营获得利润的过程中，经常地逐渐地积累资金，并试办信用合作。银行及宝兴亨煤铁店仍继续贷款及预价定货以解决资金困难。（三）关于改良生产工具，提高生产效率问题，拟请政府拨付一批贷粮，有重点地将一部分土炉改为半机器式的风机炉，以代替土法熔铁。以下是该市一九四九年铁炉业增产具体计划：（一）以该市全部生铁炉二百零五座的四分之一，即五十一座改变为十七座风火炉，按原三座土炉每日熔铁量为一千七百六十七斤，每座风火炉每日熔铁两千余斤。据此每座风火炉顶三座土炉的作用，每日能多产二百三十三斤铁水，十七座每日可增产铁水二·三六吨（按每吨约等于市秤二千斤——编者），全年以八个月计算，可增产五六六吨。其余一百五十四座土炉，将原炉壕的容积扩大，由每壕六十三个坩锅增至七十个锅，锅身亦加大，每道壕能增化铁水五十六斤，如此每日能增铁水五·一三吨，全年八个月计可增产铁货一二三一·二吨。（二）由××炉抽出五分之一的技术工人（另收一部分徒弟以补缺额。）在一年内增加土二十座，以六个月计可增产铁货一二六二吨。（三）三十八座铸造铁壶、把把锅炉，在一年内计划改变成三分之二的桶锅炉。（四）六盘水车炉，预计明年可增加为十一盘，全年能产水车七○四架，即实增铁货八十吨。（五）全市原有二百八十七座熟铁炉场（共计一千零一把火），约占总数五分之一的火把是技术工人合伙生产的，可用抽师增徒的办法，组织零散工人，可增多二百把火，每日能增产铁货四千斤。以八个月计，可增铁货五七一·二吨。最受各地欢迎的大锅片，现有条件下只能生产二十万张，明年计划再增产十万张，约增七十五吨。
    以上各项增产计划如能完成，至明年底，年产量可由一七三一○吨增产到二一○九五·四吨，可恢复到战前水平，实增铁货三七八五·四吨。为达到上述目的，该市正作调查研究与用风火炉熔化供石及改良锅模等技术试验。
