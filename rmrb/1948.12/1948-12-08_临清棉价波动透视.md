　　A Perspective on Cotton Price Fluctuations in Linqing
    Tian Liu

    The Jinan Region of Hebei Province is the cotton production center of North China, and Linqing City is the largest cotton market in Jinan. Before the war, no less than 40 million catties of cotton lint were shipped from here to Tianjin, Jinan, Qingdao, Shanghai, and other places every year. The cotton industry has always been known as the "leader of all industries" in the Linqing market. When the cotton industry in Linqing City is prosperous, all industries follow suit; when the cotton industry is sluggish, the entire city is sluggish. This round of price fluctuations also started with the rise in cotton prices, followed by the rise in all other industries.

    This round of price increases was mainly affected by the high prices in East China, especially for cotton cloth. Comparing prices on October 12th, Jinan's cotton price was 22% higher, and Tanxian was 81% higher. Other places such as Yidu were also about 50% higher. After the liberation of Jinan, transportation in vast areas became unimpeded. In early October, the North Currency and Hebei Currency were fixed at a ratio and allowed to circulate freely, making commercial trade even smoother. Given the large price differences in various places, price increases were inevitable and in line with the laws of price development.

    Before the free circulation of the two currencies, state trading organizations actively adjusted prices in the two regions to bring them into relative balance – preparations were made in this regard: before hand, joint meetings were held between the two regions, it was decided that state-owned and public trading departments in the original North Currency area should sell goods to lower prices, and those in the Hebei Currency area should purchase goods to actively increase prices. A portion of goods was also transported to the North Currency area to more effectively adjust prices in the two regions. However, this correct decision, which was related to the interests of the broad masses of the people, was not well implemented. Take the state-owned Huamao Company stationed in Linqing City as an example. In the half month between the meeting and the unification of currency values, it only purchased 42,599 catties of cotton lint, failing to implement the decision to actively increase prices.

    As a result, the work of adjusting prices in the two regions was not done well in advance. Therefore, when the announcement of the common use of the two currencies came out, merchants from various places in the North Currency area flocked to Linqing City to scramble for goods – especially cotton. Prices began to rise. At this time, our state trading departments should have taken correct measures, without hesitation immediately adopt coordinated steps, uniformly, systematically and with the courage to raise prices, firmly grasp the leadership of the market in their hands, and prevent speculators from manipulating prices, so as to protect the interests of the broad masses of farmers and small producers, and prevent them from suffering losses in the price increases. Unfortunately, our trade departments did not do this. Instead, they adopted a hesitant and uncoordinated approach, allowing it to develop freely. Seeing the rapid and sharp rise in prices, the state-owned Huamao Company stopped purchasing, hoping to stabilize the rising prices with the "example" and "posture" of state stores not buying. Other public stores (according to statistics, there were more than 20 public stores from the Hebei-Shandong-Henan, Hebei Central, Bohai, Jiaodong, and Hebei South regions at that time) were buying in large quantities. Public stores competed with each other, causing chaos. If they couldn't buy enough in the city, they sent people to the countryside and nearby towns to search for purchases; and if they still felt it was not enough, they entrusted private merchants to purchase on their behalf in large quantities. Merchants took the opportunity to play tricks, adulterating the goods and making them damp, and the market fell into extreme disorder. At this time, the government, the Bureau of Industry and Commerce, and the state-owned Huamao Company, which were responsible for mastering industrial and commercial policies, stabilizing prices, and supporting production, were very anxious about this situation. On the 14th, an emergency meeting of public stores in the city was held, deciding to jointly stop absorbing in order to stabilize the rising prices. Regardless of whether this decision itself was correct, the Huamao Company began purchasing on the second morning after the meeting, without notifying other public stores that had attended the meeting. The Jianhua Branch immediately followed suit, and cotton prices rose even faster than before the meeting, with the quality deteriorating even more seriously.

    Now, some lessons can be learned.

    This round of cotton price increases was inevitable, necessary, and in line with the natural laws of price. As long as it rises well, it will not be harmful to the broad masses of the people and small producers. Initially, the state-owned Huamao Company stopped purchasing when it saw prices rising, and then held an emergency meeting to decide to stop purchasing altogether, hoping to stabilize the rise in prices. In a situation where prices were high in other places, foreign merchants flocked to Linqing, and public stores in neighboring regions purchased in large quantities, it was impossible to achieve the goal of stabilizing prices. If it had truly been achieved, it would have allowed unscrupulous merchants to obtain even higher profits. The Huamao Company's measures and the "stop purchasing altogether" decision of the emergency meeting were both actions of surrendering the state trading organs to commercial capitalists in the market – automatically handing over the leadership of the market to private merchants and speculators. These measures may have had objective reasons (such as not fully understanding the price situation in other regions, etc.), but the main reason was the concrete manifestation of conservative empiricism in the ideological method and work method in financial and trade work. They "kindly" believed that no matter what the situation, "price increases are always bad"; they believed that state stores not buying could "stabilize" prices. Obviously, this is incorrect. They committed the error of empiricism.

    During the cotton price fluctuations, the purchase volume of public stores accounted for three-quarters of the total transaction volume. If this quantity had been purchased in an organized and step-by-step manner that complied with policies, it would have played a decisive role in the market. Because it was not done in this way, it played another decisive role – promoting and contributing to the chaos in the market. It should be especially pointed out that the De Fengyu and Taixinglong of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan state-owned stores, the former had ostensibly withdrawn from Linqing after the North China government clearly stipulated that state-owned stores "should not set up operating institutions in each district," leaving only a warehouse in Linqing City, but in fact it was still engaged in buying and selling and business; Taixinglong purchased 170,000 to 180,000 catties this time. According to investigations, the district government did not give it the task of purchasing cotton. Rather, it was chasing profits for the sake of doing business. Most of the cotton it bought was transported to Jinan to be sold for profit. After the North China government issued an order prohibiting public stores in various districts from directly purchasing cotton in Linqing, it ostensibly stopped buying, but secretly entrusted private merchants to purchase on its behalf, defying the orders of the higher-level government. The Jianhua Branch of Hebei South also used the same method to purchase approximately 500,000 catties. The manager of the Huamao Company told me: "When a district and a city have two trading organizations with the same tasks, some small contradictions often occur in many specific business matters." When the supervisor of the Jianhua Branch talked to me about the cotton price fluctuation problem this time, he also repeatedly stated: "With two systems, there are bound to be inconsistencies in work steps, and everyone has some departmentalism." After I investigated and studied the actual situation in Linqing City, I felt even more the seriousness of this problem and the urgency that brook no delay. The reporter believes that the two trading departments, the state-owned Huamao Company and the Hebei South public Jianhua Company, should be unified immediately. This is beneficial and harmless to the leadership of the market, the leadership of private commerce, the protection of the interests of small producers and the broad masses of the people, and the support of the development of production. The strength and role will be strengthened, not weakened. If the method of merger and unification is not adopted, the tasks and division of labor of state-owned and local public enterprises should be strictly and clearly stipulated. The reporter believes that local public stores should all be transferred to industry, or face the countryside. Its task should be to directly organize and support agricultural and sideline production. If large-scale purchases or sales of farmers' production and living materials or surplus products are required, it should be done through the local state-owned store. Before these two methods are realized, comrades in state-owned and public trade departments should consciously overcome narrow departmentalism, overcome the idea and behavior of simply pursuing profits, and strengthen the overall concept – this is the minimum of organization and discipline for comrades working in economic and trade departments.

    In a situation where prices are fluctuating so drastically and the market is in such chaos, and in a situation where illegal behaviors such as speculation, deception, adulteration, and dampening have become public and serious, the government and the Bureau of Industry and Commerce should take resolute and decisive measures, using laws and other methods, to effectively restrain and punish speculators (including state-owned stores) and unscrupulous merchants, so as to protect the interests of the broad masses of the people and legitimate industrialists and businessmen. However, the Bureau of Industry and Commerce only held "symposiums with public stores in neighboring districts" and "symposiums with private merchants," advising them not to adulterate the goods or make them damp. They did not say even the minimum, that is, the most lenient "prohibition" at all, which is obviously a right-leaning error.

    Summarizing the measures taken by the state trading organs in this cotton price fluctuation and accepting them as experience is an important and beneficial thing.

　　临清棉价波动透视
    田流
    冀南区是华北棉产中心，临清市又是冀南最大的棉业市场，战前经此运往津、济、青、沪等地的花绒，每年不下四千余万斤。棉业在临清市场上素称“百业之首”，临清市上只要棉业繁荣，百业随之繁荣，棉业萧条，则全市萧条。这次物价波动也是首由棉价涨起，随后百业跟着上升。
    这次物价上涨，主要是受华东物价高的影响，特别是棉布两项。按十月十二日比较，济南棉价高百分之二十二，滩县高百分之八十一，其他如益都等地也都高在百分之五十左右。济南解放后广大地区交通畅通无阻，十月初北币与冀钞又固定比值自由流通，商业贸易自然更加顺畅，在各地价格差额悬殊甚巨的情况下，物价上涨是不可免的，也是合乎物价发展规律的。
    在两种货币自由流通之前，国家贸易机关主动地调剂两区物价，使两区物价相对的趋于平衡——这方面的准备工作是作了的：事先两区曾举行联席会议，决定原北币区国、公营贸易部门要出售物资压低物价，冀币区要购入物资主动地提高物价。并运一部物资去北币区，以便更有效地调整两区物价。但这个关系广大人民利益的正确决议并没有很好地执行。就以驻在临清市的国营华茂公司为例，从开会到币值统一的半个月时间内，仅购人棉绒四二五九九斤，没有执行主动提高价格的决定。
    这样，事先调整两区物价工作没有作好，所以当两币通用的布告传出，北币各地商人便云集临清市，争购货物——特别是棉花，物价开始上涨，这时，我们的国家贸易部门应该采取正确的措施，毫不踌躇地即时采取步调，统一有步骤同时又是有魄力地提高物价，把市场的领导权紧紧掌握在自己手中，杜绝奸商投机操纵的可能，以保护广大农民和广大小生产者的利益，在物价上涨中不致蒙受损害。可惜，我们的贸易部门又没有这样作，而是采取了犹疑不决，各自为政的办法，任其自流的发展。国营华茂公司见物价这样迅速猛涨，就停止了购买，想用国家商店不购买的“榜样”和“姿态”来稳定上升不已的物价。其他的公营商店（据统计当时有冀鲁豫、冀中、渤海、胶东及冀南等区公营商店二十余家），则正在大量的购入，公营和公营之间争购抢购闹成一团，本市不够买，纷纷派人去乡下及附近各城镇去搜购；自己买尤嫌不足，再大量的委托私商代购，商人则趁机捣鬼，掺假使潮，市场陷于极度紊乱中。这时负有掌握工商政策、稳定物价、扶助生产任务的政府，工商局和国营华茂公司对此情况却非常焦急。十四日召开了一个市内公营商店的紧急会议，决定共同停止吸收，以稳定上升不已的物价，先不说这个决议本身是否正确，而华茂公司在开完会的第二个早晨，便不通知参加会议的其他公营商店，开始购买了。建华一分公司一看见，也就立时下手了，于是棉价比开会前更迅速的猛涨，成色更严重的降低。
    现在可以找到一些教训了
    此次棉价上涨是不可免的，必然的，合乎物价自然规律的，只要涨得好，对广大人民及小生产者并没有坏处。最初国营华茂公司见物价上涨停止了购买，随后又开紧急会议决议一律停止购买，想稳定物价的上升。在其他地方物价皆高，外商云集临清，友邻区公营商店大批购买的形势下，是不可能达到稳定物价目的的，如果真正达到了，那将使奸商获得更高的利润。华茂公司这种措置和紧急会议“一律停止收买”的决议，都是使国家贸易机关在市场上向商业资本家缴械——自动的将市场的领导权交给私商和投机者。这种措置，也许有客观原因（譬如对外区物价情况不太了解等），但主要的是思想方法上以及工作方法上的保守的经验主义在财经贸易工作上的具体表现。他们“好心肠”地认为不管在什么情况下，反正“物价上涨就不好”；认为国家商店不购买就能“稳定”物价。显然这是不对的。犯了经验主义的错误。
    在棉价波动期间，公营商店购入量占全部成交额的四分之三，如果这个数量是用有组织有步骤、符合政策的方法购入，将对市场起决定性的作用，因为没有这样作，也就起了另一个决定性的作用——促成和助长了市场的紊乱。尤应特别提出的是冀鲁豫国营商店德丰裕和泰兴隆，前者在华北政府明确规定国营商店“各区不设立经营机构”后，表面上已经由临清撤走，只在临清市留下了一个仓库，但事实上仍在进行着买卖和营业；泰兴隆这次购入十七、八万斤，据调查该区政府并没有给他购买棉花的任务，而是它自己为了作买卖追逐利润，他买入的棉花大部运往济南卖出赚钱了。华北政府关于属内各区公营商店不许直接在临清购买棉花的命令下达后，他明着不买了，暗中仍然委托私商代购，违抗上级政府的命令。冀南建华一分公司也用同样的方式收购约五十万斤。华茂公司经理告诉我：“一个地区一个城市同时有两个任务相同的贸易机关，在许多具体业务问题上常常发生一些小的矛盾。”建华一分公司监委同我谈到这次棉价波动问题时也一再说明：“两个系统，就免不了有些工作上步调不一致，谁也有些本位主义。”在我调查并研究了临清市的实际情况后，我更感到了这个问题的严重性，和刻不容缓的迫切性。记者认为：应该立即把国营华茂公司与冀南公营建华公司两个贸易部门统一起来，这样对市场的领导，对私营商业的领导，对保护小生产者与广大人民的利益和扶助发展生产等，都是有利无害的，力量和作用是更会加强不会削弱的。如果不采用合并统一的办法，就应该严格和明确规定国营和地方性公营企业的任务和分工，记者认为地方性的公营商店应一律转入工业，要不就面向农村，它的任务应该是直接的组织和扶助农业及副业生产，如果需要大宗的购入或售出农民生产和生活资料或剩余生产品，应通过当地国营商店。在这两个方法都未实现以前，国营和公营贸易部门的同志们，应该自觉的克服狭小的本位主义，克服单纯追逐利润的思想和行为，加强整体观念——这是经济贸易部门工作的同志们起码的组织性和纪律性。
    在物价发生如此剧烈的波动，市场陷于如此紊乱的情况下，在投机欺骗掺假使潮等犯法行为已经变为公开的严重情况下，政府和工商局应该采取坚决的断然措置，用法律和其他方法，对投机者（国营商店在内）奸商给予有效的制止和处分，以保护广大人民及正当工商业者的利益。但工商局仅只是召开了“友邻区公营商店座谈会”、“私商座谈会”，劝他们不要惨假使潮，连最低限度的，也就是宽大的最高限度的“禁止”两个字全没说，显然这是一种右倾的错误。
    总结此次棉价波动中，国家贸易机关的措施，作为经验接受下来，是件重要而有益的事情。
