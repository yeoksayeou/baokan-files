　　Within the Encirclement
  　The Imminent Destruction of Du Yuming's Bandit Army
    From the accounts of more than 30 captured Chiang bandit army lower-ranking officers and soldiers, it can be seen that Du Yuming's bandit army, heavily surrounded by the People's Liberation Army in the small area northeast of Yongcheng, has fallen into a desperate situation of hunger, cold, and death. According to Zhou Hanquan, a lieutenant clerk of the "Xuzhou Pacification Headquarters," "More than 100,000 people are surrounded by the People's Liberation Army in a small circle about 20 li from north to south and about 10 li from east to west, extremely crowded. Every village and every house is packed with people. The common people have been driven out of their houses, but there are still many people who have no place to stay and have to camp in the fields and ditches. Even the 200 personnel from the 'Pacification Headquarters' who could not be airlifted to Nanjing have to camp in the fields outside the Zhuang Wei Zi (village defense) of Du Yuming's 'Forward Command Post.' Every morning, a layer of frost can be seen on the bodies of the campers." Then, Ren Sensheng, a lieutenant attached to the 117th Regiment of the 40th Army, said, "The small village we lived in had only a few dozen households, but I don't know how many units were crammed in, totaling more than 10,000 people. The fields and gullies were filled. More than 200 wounded soldiers brought back from the front line had no place to live and lay in the gullies. More than 30 people froze to death during one night of camping."
    Even more serious than the housing shortage is the Chiang bandit army's food shortage. According to Gu Yijun, the chief of staff of the Independent Brigade of the Qiu Corps who surrendered, "From the 4th, all agencies and units ran out of food and began to rob the common people of sweet potatoes and mixed beans." According to Song Guanghuai, a private in the 6th Company, 1st Battalion, 709th Regiment, 237th Division, 8th Army of the Li Mi Corps, "For the first few days, we robbed the common people of their chickens. Later, we ate puppies, kittens, cattle, and donkeys. Recently, we have been slaughtering and eating the mules and horses of our own units. Many soldiers use copper basins, clay pots, and broken pots to light fires in the fields to cook and burn sweet potatoes and soybeans, eating them half-cooked. Getting one or two meals a day is considered the best. Some wounded soldiers who cannot move can only get one meal of sweet potatoes a day, and some wounded soldiers who are slow to move can only grab a piece." At this time, Song Guanghuai took out the uncooked soybeans from his pocket and put them in his mouth, jokingly saying, "This is considered a good thing in our place." Zhou Hanbo also said, "The 200 personnel of the 'Pacification Headquarters' brought eight packages of rice and eight packages of foreign flour from Xuzhou by car. On the 5th, when they arrived in Xiazhai, the rice and flour on the cars were robbed by other units. From the 6th, the 200 people of the 'Pacification Headquarters' also relied on robbing the villagers' sweet potatoes to fill their stomachs."
    The reporter asked, "Isn't Nanjing airdropping supplies?" They sighed a few times and said, "After we were surrounded, a total of seven or eight packages of rice were airdropped, and they were all taken by Du Yuming and Qiu Qingquan. Which other agencies and units could get a grain!"
    The villages where the Chiang bandit army lived had extreme difficulty in getting drinking water. Ren Sensheng said, "The village where I lived was crammed with more than 10,000 people. The water in the pond had been drunk dry. Although there was still some water in a well, it was crowded with people, fighting and pushing each other, making it difficult to draw water from the well."
    Finally, more than 30 prisoners aptly described their surrounded life by saying, "We are like a large group of fish, swimming, jumping, and bouncing around in a small pond that is about to dry up. After the last few drops of water are gone, we will die."

### 围歼圈内　即将覆没的杜聿明匪军

　　围歼圈内
  　即将覆没的杜聿明匪军
    从卅多个被俘的蒋匪军下级官兵的口述中，可以看到：被解放军重重包围在永城东北狭小地区之杜聿明匪军，已陷入饥寒与死亡的绝境。据“徐州剿总”少尉文书周汉泉说：“十万余人被解放军包围在南北二十里东西约十里的一个小圈子内，拥挤不堪，每个村庄每间房子都塞满了人，老百姓都被赶到屋子外面去，但还有许多人无容身之处，只得露营在田野里、河沟里，连‘剿总’总部未及空运南京的二百个人员，亦只得在杜聿明的‘前进指挥所’的庄圩子外田野里露营了。每天早晨都可从露营人的身上看到一片严霜。”接着，四十军一一七团少尉附员任森生说：“我们住的小庄子不过几十户人家不知塞进了多少单位，总计一万多人，田野里、山沟里都塞满了。从前线抬来的二百多伤员没有地方住，就躺在山沟里。在一夜的露营中，就冻死了三十多人。”
    比房子困难还更严重的是蒋匪军的粮食困难，据投降的邱兵团独立旅参谋主任顾逸君说：“从四日起，各机关各部队就断了粮，开始抢老百姓的山芋与杂豆吃了。”据李弥兵团八军二三七师七零九团一营六连列兵宋广怀说：“我们开始几天是抢老百姓的鸡子吃，后来就吃小狗、小猫、牛驴了，最近已在杀吃自己部队的骡马。有许多士兵用铜盆、瓦盆、坏锅就在田野里点起火来煮烧山芋黄豆，半生不熟就吃光了，一天弄到一二顿饭就算最好的了。有些不会动手的伤兵，一天只能吃到一顿山芋，有些伤兵动作慢了，只能抢到一块。”这时，宋广怀就摸出袋里未烧熟的黄豆放进嘴里，打趣的说：“这在我们那里就算好东西了。”周汉波也说：“‘剿总’的二百多人员，由徐州用汽车带出八包大米，八包洋面，五日，开到夏寨时，汽车上的大米、白面就被别的单位抢光了，从六号起‘剿总’的二百人也靠抢老乡们的山芋充饥。”
    记者问起：“南京不是用飞机空投吗？”他们长叹了几口气说：“我们被包围后，总共空投了七八包米，都给杜聿明、邱清泉拿去了，其他的机关部队哪个能分到一粒！”
    蒋匪军所住的村庄，吃水极为困难，任森生说：“我住过的一个庄上，挤了一万多人，水塘里的水已被吃干，虽有一口井还有点水，但井上挤满了人，你争他夺，你推他拥，难解难分，井里的水也打不上来。”
    最后，三十多个俘虏很恰当的形容他们的被围生活说：“我们就好象一大群鱼，在一个快要干涸的小水塘里乱游，乱跳，乱蹦，还有几口水，吃完了就要死了。”  　　【新华社淮海前线十八日电】
