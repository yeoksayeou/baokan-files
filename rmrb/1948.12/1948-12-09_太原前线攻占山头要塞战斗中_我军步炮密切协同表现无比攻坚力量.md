[Taiyuan Frontline Dispatch] Frontline reporter Bing Ru reports: In the battle to capture the mountain fortress southeast of Taiyuan, our heroic artillery group actively cooperated with the infantry, demonstrating unparalleled attacking power, and completely destroying the Yang cement blockhouse group fortifications that the Yan bandits relied on as impregnable. Before the general offensive began on October 26th, a heavy artillery company of a certain unit, which had displayed great power in capturing the Beiying fortress, initiated a competition with the infantry: "Guarantee to open the road for the assault, and ensure that the infantry developing in depth suffers no losses." Before entering the position, all the company's observers and gunners used all their wisdom and energy to study firing techniques and check primers. After our field artillery opened a gap in the enemy's forward positions, the heavy artillery company immediately used the main blockhouse as a benchmark and bombarded the forward positions from far to near, covering the infantry's safe assault. After the infantry approached the forward positions, the heavy artillery immediately turned to bombard the enemy's in-depth field fortifications, preventing the enemy from raising their heads. On the 26th, the seventh and eighth companies of a certain unit captured two group fortifications on the enemy's right flank. Our artillery group specifically divided the work and quickly destroyed the enemy's three-story shaved-wall gun-hole bunkers, opening up the road for the infantry's assault. A second-class gunner destroyed a brick bunker in front with two delayed-action explosive shells. Gunner Qin Xiaojun, a former KMT soldier who was liberated in the Jinzhong Campaign, was responsible for destroying the enemy's firepower points. He fired 109 rounds in one hour, all but seven of which hit the target. The left-wing artillery group killed the enemy battalion commander in a plum-blossom high bunker with three shells. The heavy artillery company of a certain unit used devastating blows to completely annihilate the bandits wearing helmets and shooting at the gap in the field fortifications. The famous Li Haishui company assault team immediately rushed up the mountain and planted the victory red flag on the plum-blossom bunker.

　　Xu Sen, the Yan bandit's ninth general detachment commander and commander of the eastern district bunker defense, who was cowering in Shantou Village, was frightened by our fierce artillery fire and ordered the bunker defense officers and soldiers to switch to field fortification resistance, and mobilized artillery from Mazhuang and Shuangtasi to support them. Our crack gunners destroyed three bunkers on the right wing of the breakthrough, assisting the first company's assault troops in seizing the Huangtupo field fortifications. The machine gun side-firing firepower on the left front of the slope hindered the assault of our third company, and the artillery of a certain unit quickly destroyed it. Their highly accurate firing technology (seventy-seven hits out of seventy-eight rounds) was praised by the main attack troops.

　　The artillery heroes often listened to the opinions of the infantry, and constantly improved their cooperation between artillery and infantry. On the 28th, when attacking the left-wing mountain fortress of Danaoshan, our light and heavy artillery first concentrated on bombarding the enemy's forward main position. After the troops approached the forward edge, our two wings of artillery suddenly extended their fire to the left and right, and the assault team took the opportunity to break through the gap and quickly wiped out the enemy.

　　On November 9th, our army launched an attack on the main position of the Shantou fortress. The red and green arrows of the shells completely controlled the four interconnected positions of the Yan bandits, and every fire point of the twenty-four cement-reinforced bunkers was subjected to fierce bombardment by our artillery group. The two-zhang-high slope on the southeast protruding area of the enemy's third position was opened up by artillery fire into a wide assault road. The battle for the Shantou fortress went on day and night, and the artillery heroes, like the infantry, showed infinite tenacity and bravery. The fortifications of a certain unit's mountain artillery position were destroyed by enemy artillery fire, and the gunners pulled the guns out of the position and continued to bombard the enemy. In the final general offensive, our intensive artillery fire hit the 3rd Battalion of the 247th Regiment of the 83rd Division, which Jiang bandits had just airlifted reinforcements from Yulin, so hard that they could not even return fire, and they were captured in their dugouts. The Shantou fortress, which the Yan bandits once regarded as their "lifeline," was finally destroyed under the cooperation of our infantry and artillery.

　　太原前线攻占山头要塞战斗中
  　我军步炮密切协同表现无比攻坚力量
    【太原前线电】前线记者冰如报导：在攻占太原东南山头要塞战斗中，我神勇炮兵群积极与步兵协同作战，表现了无比的攻坚力量，将阎匪自恃不可攻破的洋灰高碉集团阵地完全摧毁。十月二十六日全线总攻开始前，曾在夺取北营要塞时大显神威的某部重炮连，就向步兵发起竞赛：“保证打开冲锋道路，并使向纵深发展的步兵不受损失。”全连观察员、瞄准手在进入阵地前，用尽全部精力的智慧，研究发射技术，检查底火。我山野炮轰开敌前沿阵地缺口后，重炮连即以主碉为基准，由远而近的齐向前沿阵地轰击，掩护步兵安全冲锋，步兵接近前沿后，重炮即转向敌人纵深野战工事轰击，打得敌人不能抬头。二十六日，某部七八连攻占敌右翼两个集团阵地，我炮兵群具体分工，迅速摧毁敌三层削壁炮眼暗堡，为步兵开阔冲锋道路，二班神炮手以两发延性爆炸弹，将正面一个砖碉完全摧毁。一炮手秦晓俊是晋中战役解放的炮兵，他负责摧毁敌之火力点，一点钟内连发一百零九发，除七发外全部命中，左翼炮兵群以三发炮弹，即将敌营长压死在梅花高碉内。某部重炮连以毁灭性打击，将头戴钢盔正对缺口野战工事射击之匪徒完全消灭。著名的李海水连突击队立即冲上山头，把胜利红旗插在梅花碉上。
    龟缩在山头村内的阎匪九总队长兼东区守碉司令许森，被我猛烈炮火吓破了胆，驱使守碉官兵转入野工事抵抗，并调集马庄、双塔寺等地炮兵支援，我神炮手摧毁突破口右翼三个暗堡，援助一连冲锋部队抢占荒土坡野战工事。劈坡左前敌机枪侧射火力，妨碍我三连的冲锋，某部炮兵迅速将其击灭。百发百中的射击技术（七十八发命中七十七发），得到主攻部队交口赞扬。
    炮兵英雄们经常倾听步兵意见，在步炮协同上随时改进。二十八日，攻占大脑山左翼山头堡垒时，我轻重炮火先集中向敌前沿主阵地轰击，部队接近前沿棱堆后，我两冀炮火突然向左右延伸射击，突击队乘势突上缺口，迅速消灭敌人。
    十一月九日，我军对山头要塞主阵地发起攻击。炮弹的红绿箭头完全控制了阎匪四个互相毗连的阵地，二十四个洋灰钢筋伏地碉的每个火点，都遭到我炮兵群的猛烈轰击。敌第三号阵地东南突出地带两丈高的劈坡，均被炮火打开宽阔的冲锋道路。山头要塞争夺战日夜进行，炮兵英雄们也和步兵一样表现了无限的顽强与英勇。某部山炮阵地的工事被敌人的炮火摧毁了，炮手们把炮拉出阵地继续向敌人轰击。在最后总攻战斗中，我密集炮火打得蒋匪刚从榆林空运增援的八十三师二四七团三营来不及还手，就在地洞里当了俘虏。阎匪曾当作“生命点”的山头要塞在我步炮协同下终于最后毁灭了。
