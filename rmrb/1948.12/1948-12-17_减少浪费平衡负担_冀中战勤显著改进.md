　　Reducing Waste and Balancing Burdens
　　Jizhong War Logistics Significantly Improved

　　[Jizhong Electric] Over the past nine months, the People's Armed Forces Departments and logistics departments at all levels in Jizhong have achieved significant results in rectifying and improving war logistics and support mobilization. In supporting the campaigns in Chahar South, Hebei East, Baoding North, Suiyuan-Mongolia, Taiyuan, and wheat protection, a total of 150,000 civilians, over 30,900 stretchers, and over 2,700 carts were mobilized, all successfully completing their missions. In the expedition to Chahar South, lasting eight months, they climbed mountains, crossed rivers, and traveled nearly ten thousand li, overcoming all difficulties to complete their tasks. Not a single civilian from Anping, Anguo, Wuqiang, or Jin County deserted, and Anguo was awarded the honorary title of "Iron Civilian Corps," while Qing County received the "Iron Civilian Company" title. A large number of meritorious models emerged from the civilians in various regions. In the Eighth, Ninth, and Eleventh Military Sub-districts, 925 meritorious models emerged. Ninety-eight percent of Anguo civilians were recognized for their contributions.

　　Significant achievements have also been made in logistical mobilization and financial savings. For example, in terms of the ratio of soldiers to laborers, it has increased from two soldiers per laborer last year to five or six soldiers per laborer this year. Compared to last year, the number of stretchers accompanying each brigade has been reduced by 56 percent. Moreover, mobilizing civilians from the rear supply line has been replaced by on-the-spot procurement, saving civilians sevenfold, completing the support mission without hindering rear production. In the clearing of war expenses, statistics for April and May showed that each column saved one-third within the prescribed amount, saving more than six times compared to last year.

　　During the period from last winter to this spring, some counties experienced chaos due to the unsound three-level logistics organization at the county, district, and village levels, and some cadres in various departments had insufficient understanding of logistical mobilization, resulting in abuse of civilian labor and animal power, as well as illegal mobilization: (1) Some villages exhibited forced labor and hiring phenomena in supporting mobilization: In the Baoding North wheat protection campaign, Su Ning Qiao Shang Shop hired civilians for 810,000 yuan (old currency). Many villages demanded money, clothes, and other items when civilians set out on expeditions. As a result, desertion occurred after the campaign began. (2) Imbalance in logistical burdens: For example, in Junhe Village, Jianguo County, a total of 134 village cadres, militiamen, and military dependents, accounting for more than 43 percent of the total number of people who should have been on duty, failed to do so. There was also an imbalance between villages: For example, Gangyuanfang Village in Jin County had 95 livestock and 450 laborers, and each person worked an average of more than six workdays and nearly sixteen livestock workdays in more than half a year; while in the nearby Xizhao Village, there were 83 livestock and 465 laborers, and each livestock worked less than four workdays on average, and each person worked less than one workday. The difference between the two villages was four to six times. Villages where agencies, factories, and transportation hubs were located bore heavier burdens than remote villages. Female labor was particularly heavy. In Daili Village, Anping, women worked an average of seven workdays per month, while other villages rarely or did not use female labor at all. The burden of farming assistance was heavy, such as in Shuangjing and Datianzhuang in Shen County, where farming assistance accounted for 45 percent of the entire logistical effort. The burden in the border areas was far heavier than in the central areas. Due to the imbalance in burdens, the logistical burden in some villages was heavier than the financial burden. For example, in Li County last year, the mobilization of livestock and human labor amounted to over 3,989,000 jin of rice, while public grain and local grain were only over 3,342,000 jin, with the human labor burden being 8 percent heavier than the financial burden. In Wurenqiao, Anguo, the logistical burden was four and a half times heavier than the financial burden. Due to the chaos in logistical mobilization, coupled with the failure to record workdays, clean labor, and uniform labor, the masses were dissatisfied, with some reflecting: "We are not afraid of logistical duty, but we are afraid of unreasonableness."

　　Several Rectification Methods:

　　Unified War Logistics Management
　　Division of Different Regions
　　Establishment of Transportation Stations.

　　In response to the above chaos, a profound review was conducted in February, and specific improvement measures were discussed and decided upon; rectification was carried out from the following aspects: First, rectify the organization and strengthen the unified management of front and rear logistics. War Logistics Sections were added to all counties and above, and grass-roots organizations were generally rectified. According to statistics from eleven counties and one city in the Ninth Military Sub-district, 610 villages were initially rectified, and 843 villages are currently being carried out in conjunction with the central work. Second, according to the three different regions of the area—border, transportation hub, and remote—they were appropriately divided into three lines with emphasis. Border war zone: such as eleven counties including Anxin, Wenxin, and Jinghai, as the first line, mainly responsible for resolving the logistical duties of on-the-spot supply in the war zone. Transportation hub agencies stationed: nine counties as the first line, focusing on organizing large-vehicle transportation teams, followed by stretchers; each district organized a company, and generally medium-sized villages prepared two to three sets of personnel. Remote areas: such as twelve counties including Qingcangjiao, Jianguo, and Shoujiao, as the first line, mainly responsible for long-distance war logistics accompanying the army. The civilians in each district and village have been properly organized and fixed with regimental, company, and platoon leaders, among which a certain number of key personnel have been allocated. Third, a unified management reporting system has been initially established at all levels above the district level, a mobilization certificate has been implemented, and each level and department reports a quarterly budget for the use of logistics. Fourth, thirty-five transportation stations and fifty sub-stations have been established on transportation hubs, the labor and animal power have been uniformly compiled, the system of rotation of duties, recording of workdays, and uniform labor have been implemented, and the imbalance between villages and households in the past has been rectified by clearing and compensating labor. Fifth, two training teams were convened in September to train 400 cadres above the district level to supplement the organizations above the district level.

　　After the rectification, preliminary results have been achieved. The most significant is that in the border war zone, the division of regions and the implementation of on-the-spot procurement have greatly saved civilian labor. In the three battles in Baoding North, calculated at the central station, only 270 short-distance stretchers were used; while in the three battles in Baoding North last year, 2,800 long-distance stretchers were used, a difference of nine times. In An Guo, forty-nine villages spent over 2,800 workdays and 1,532 large vehicles in one month before the establishment of transportation stations; after the construction, they spent 501 workdays and 414 large vehicles in one month. After the establishment of stations in Zou Village, Liuchu, and Dayin Village in Raoyang, the imbalance in the burden of the surrounding twenty-three villages was cleared and compensated, and the waste in mobilization was generally reduced. In the villages that have been rectified, the cadres and civilians have strengthened their organization and discipline in thought and action, and their appearance has been renewed.

　　Although achievements have been made in the rectification, many shortcomings still exist in some places and need to be improved. For example, in the use of civilians to support the front, the prior planning is not thorough and unscientific, resulting in the phenomenon of fewer deployments and more use. In the first half of the year, 40,400 civilians were deployed, and 68,900 were actually used, with a large difference, resulting in insufficient use and random grabbing, which increased the logistical burden of the local area. There are still illegal mobilization and waste phenomena in the mobilization of civilians. In the villages that have not been rectified, some civilian village cadres have confused ideas, and the leadership of some counties does not pay enough attention to the rectification of war logistics. Some places do not mention the rectification of war logistics in the deployment of winter work. Therefore, in conjunction with the end of the land reform work this winter, we should also appropriately equip armed logistics cadres, continue to carry out rectification, and carry out winter training to strengthen the ideological education of civilians and militias in supporting the front.

　　减少浪费平衡负担
  　冀中战勤显著改进
    【冀中电】冀中各级人民武装部及后勤部门，九个月来在整顿、改进战勤与支前动员中获得很大成绩。在支援察南、冀东、保北、绥蒙、太原、护麦等战役中，共计动员民工达十五万人，担架三万零九百余付，大车两千七百余辆，均胜利完成任务。远征察南中，历时八个月，爬山过河，跋涉近万里，克服了一切困难完成了任务。安平、安国、武强、晋县民工无一逃亡，安国获得了“钢铁民工团”、青县获得“钢铁民工连”的光荣称号。各地民工涌现了大批功臣模范。八、九、十一分区，出现功臣模范九百二十五人。安国民工百分之九十八立了功。
    在勤务动员与财政节减上亦收到很大成绩。如以兵夫相比，去年二兵一夫，今年达到五兵或六兵一夫，去年每旅随军担架与今年相比，节省百分之五十六。并由后方补给线动员民工，改为就地取给，计节省民工达七倍，既完成支前任务，又不误后方生产。在清理战费中，四、五两月份统计，所规定的数目内，每纵队节省三分之一，与去年相较节省六倍以上。
    在去冬今春时期，一般县份因县区村三级后勤组织不健全，各部门有的干部对勤务动员上认识不足，滥用民工畜力与非法动员，致表现一度混乱：（一）有的村支前动员中存在着强迫、雇佣现象：在保北护麦战役中，肃宁桥上铺雇佣民工用洋八十万一千元。不少的村在民工出征时，要款、要衣服等物。因此，战役开始后，便形成了逃亡现象。（二）勤务负担上的不平衡：如建国县军河村，应出勤而不出勤的村干、民兵、军属等共一百三十四人，占全村应出勤数的百分之四十三以上。村与村间也很不平衡：如晋县冈元方村牲口九十五头，人力四百五十个，半年多每人平均出工六个多，畜工将近十六个；而附近村西赵庄牲口八十三个，人力四百六十五个，每畜平均出工不足四个，人工不到一个。两村相差四至六倍。机关工厂驻地及交通要道村庄，较偏僻村庄负担也繁重。女勤特多，安平大义里村妇女平均每月出工七个。而其他村出女勤则很少或根本没有。代耕勤务繁重的如深县双井、大田庄，代耕勤务占整个勤务百分之四十五。边缘区负担则远重于中心地区。由于负担不平衡，以致有的村勤务负担重于财力负担。如蠡县去年动员畜工、人勤，折米三百九十八万九千余斤，公粮地方粮仅三百三十四万二千余斤，人力负担比财力负担重百分之八。安国伍仁桥勤务负担重于财力四倍半。由于勤务动员中的混乱再加上有的不记工、清工、齐工，致使群众不满，有的反映：“不怕出勤务，就怕不合理。”
    几种整顿方法：
    统一战勤管理
    划分不同地区
    建立交通站。
    对上述混乱情况，二月即作了深刻的检讨，并具体讨论决定了改进办法；从以下几方面进行整顿：一、整顿组织，加强前后方勤务统一管理。县以上均添设了战勤股，普遍整顿基层组织。据九分区十一个县一个市统计，六百一十个村初步整顿，八百四十三村现结合中心工作正在进行。二、根据本区边缘、交通要道、偏僻三种不同地区，有重点适当的划分成三线。边缘作战区：如安新、文新、静海等十一县为一线，主要负担解决战地取给的勤务。交通要道机关驻地：有九个县为一线，以组织大车运输队为重点，担架次之；每区组织了一个连，一般中等村准备了二至三套成员。偏僻区：如青沧交、建国、兽交等十二县为一线。主要负担随军远征战勤。各区村之民工均已编制妥当，固定了团、连、排长，其中并配备了一定的骨干。三、区以上各级初步树立了统一管理的汇报制度，实行了动员证，各级各部门动用勤务按季造报预算。四、在交通要道建立了交通站三十五个，分站五十个，统一编制了人工畜力，实行了轮流出勤、计工齐工等，并对过去村与村，户与户间之不平衡，进行清工补工。五、九月间召开训练队两期，训练了四百个区以上干部，补充到区以上的组织中去。
    经过整顿后，已获得初步成绩。最显著的如边缘作战区，在划分了地区、实行了就地取给后，大大节省了民工。在保北三个战役中，以中心站计算，仅用短勤担架二百七十付；而去年保北三次战役，即用了长勤二千八百付，相差九倍。安国四十九个村，在未建立交通站以前，一个月出工二千八百余个，大车一千五百三十二辆；建设后一个月出工五百零一个，大车四百一十四辆。饶阳邹村、留楚、大尹村在建站以后，清补了所属周围二十三个村负担的不平衡，并普遍减少了动员中的浪费。已整顿好的村庄，干部、民工在思想与行动上，加强了组织性与纪律性，面容一新。
    在整顿中虽收到成绩，但有的地方尚存在很多缺点，仍须改进。如在支前动用民工上，事前计划不周密，不科学，发生调少用多现象。上半年调用民工四万零四百个，实用到六万八千九百余个，差数很大，致不够用而随地乱抓，加重了当地的勤务负担。在动员民工中，仍有非法动员与浪费现象。在未经整顿的村庄，有的民工村干部思想混乱，某些县份领导上对整顿战勤重视不够，有的地方在布置冬季工作中，不提整顿战勤工作等。因此，在今冬结合结束土改工作中，还应适当配备武装后勤干部，继续进行整顿，开展冬训加强民工民兵支前思想教育。
