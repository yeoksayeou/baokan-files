Xinhua News Agency, Huaihai Front, 28th: The increasingly unbearable hunger and cold are accelerating the disintegration of Du Yuming's bandit troops besieged northeast of Yongcheng. On the 25th, there was heavy rain and severe cold, and enemy airdrops have been cut off for a week. Enemy officers and soldiers are beginning to freeze and starve to death. Under the persuasion of the surrounding People's Liberation Army's calls, more and more are surrendering to the People's Liberation Army to seek a way out. According to statistics, from the 16th to the 24th, more than 2,000 people surrendered to the People's Liberation Army, and another 300 surrendered on the night of the 25th alone. Soldiers eager to save themselves are now even resorting to armed force to break through the surveillance, blockades, and suppression of officers to surrender. On the 24th, two platoons of the enemy's 5th Army fought and ran, coming out to surrender. According to surrendered officers and soldiers, more than 300 officers and soldiers of the besieged bandit army have starved to death in the past week. These besieged troops now have no food to eat, no firewood to burn, and no cotton-padded clothes or quilts. Many surrendered officers and soldiers could not even speak when they arrived because they were so frozen. These surrendering people also said that many of their company and battalion commanders no longer care about fighting, and some even wailed and cried. The People's Liberation Army is now stepping up various persuasion efforts to the besieged bandit troops, urging them to surrender quickly and find a way out.

　　被围杜聿明匪部
  　三百官兵已遭饿死
  　纷纷冲破敌封锁投向我军
    【新华社淮海前线二十八日电】日益难忍的饥寒，正加速着被围于永城东北的杜聿明匪部分崩瓦解。二十五日此间又大雨严寒，敌机空投已断绝一周。开始冻死饿死的敌军官兵，在周围解放军喊话的劝告下，向解放军投降，自找生路的已越来越多。据统计，自十六日至二十四日向解放军投降的共有二千余人，二十五日一个晚上就又有三百余人来降。自救心切的士兵现在甚至采取武装冲破军官的监视封锁和镇压的方法出来投降，二十四日就有敌五军二个排边打边跑，出来投降。据投降的官兵说：周来被围匪军仅饿死的官兵已有三百余人。这些被围部队现在一无饭吃，二无柴烧，三无棉衣棉被。许多投降的官兵来到时已冻得话都说不出来。这些投降者并说：他们的许多营连长都不顾再打仗，有的并号啕痛哭。现解放军正加紧向被围的匪军进行各种劝告工作，要他们赶快投降，自找生路。
