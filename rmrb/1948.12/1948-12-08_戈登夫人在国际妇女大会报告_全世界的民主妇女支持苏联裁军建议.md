Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, December 5th: TASS, Budapest, December 1st: The Second International Women's Congress opened here on December 1st. The presidium of the congress includes the most prominent representatives of the international democratic women's movement. The congress unanimously adopted the agenda. The congress will also elect new leadership bodies for the alliance.

On the morning of the 1st, the congress heard a report on the activities of the International Democratic Women's Federation by its president, Madame Gordon. Madame Gordon reported that the opening of this congress coincides with the third anniversary of the founding of the International Democratic Women's Federation, which now has branches in more than 50 countries. In the three years since its establishment, the International Democratic Women's Federation has concentrated its efforts on anti-fascism, striving to consolidate peace and democracy, and fighting for women's political, social, and economic rights and improving the status of children. She said: When we convened our first congress in December 1945, immediately after the victory, we hoped that the Allies would maintain their unity and work together within the United Nations to establish a lasting and just peace. Unfortunately, our hopes have not been realized. Madame Gordon emphasized that Western countries have systematically violated all international agreements and are pursuing a policy of expansion and incitement to new wars. However, this policy has been opposed by the democratic camp headed by the great Soviet Union. The British and French governments once brought the misfortune of Munich to some countries, but the Soviet Union has liberated these countries. Describing the struggle of women for peace and freedom, she detailed the mass demonstrations of heroic French women, as well as demonstrations by women in Italy, Morocco, Tunisia, North Korea, and Latin America. She said that the unity of women worldwide and their friendship with Soviet women are growing. When Madame Gordon spoke of women around the world supporting the Soviet proposals for a one-third reduction in armaments by the five major powers and for the banning of atomic weapons, the audience erupted in thunderous applause. She pointed out that women in many countries have submitted petitions to the United Nations, signed by millions of women, supporting the Soviet proposals. She also detailed the struggles of women in the United States, Spain, Greece, and other countries, as well as the democratic women's movement in Germany. She concluded: "We know that the struggle for democracy is a long and often bloody one, but we also know that without this struggle, we will never achieve security and happiness." The congress adjourned after hearing the report.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, December 5th: TASS, Budapest, December 1st: A torchlight parade celebrating the Second International Women's Congress was held here, with the participation of 100,000 women from Budapest. The marchers carried slogans calling for a struggle against warmongers and for peace, democracy, and progress. As they reached the square in front of the Hungarian Parliament, the International Women's Congress was holding a meeting in the hall. Representatives attending the International Women's Congress delivered speeches to the marchers. Madame Gordon, President of the International Democratic Women's Federation, called on women to fight against those who are preparing for a new war. When Madame Popova, Vice President of the International Democratic Women's Federation and head of the Soviet delegation attending the Women's Congress, appeared on the stage, the marching crowd greeted her with thunderous cheers. When she mentioned the name of the great fighter for peace, Stalin, the participants enthusiastically cheered the great leader of the Soviet peoples.

  　全世界的民主妇女支持苏联裁军建议
    【新华社陕北五日电】塔斯社匈京布达佩斯一日讯：第二届国际妇女大会于十二月一日在此间揭幕。大会主席团中包括最著名的国际民主妇女运动的代表。大会一致通过议事日程。大会并将选举联盟新的领导机构。
    一日晨，大会听取国际民主妇女联盟主席戈登夫人关于该联盟活动的报告。戈登夫人报告称：这次大会开幕，适值国际民主妇联成立三周年，妇联目前在五十余国都已有了分会。国际民主妇联在成立后的三年中，一直集中全力进行反法西斯主义、争取巩固和平与民主的斗争，进行争取妇女政治、社会和经济权利、改善儿童地位的斗争。她说：我们在一九四五年十二月紧接胜利后召开第一次大会时，我们曾希望盟国能保持他们的团结，在联合国内共同工作，以期建立巩固与正义的和平。不幸，我们的希望并未实现。戈登夫人着重指出西方各国有系统地破坏了一切国际协议，并奉行扩张和煽动新战争的政策。但这一政策遭到以伟大苏联为首的民主阵营的反对。英法政府曾把慕尼黑的厄运带给一些国家，苏联已使这些国家获得了解放。她在描述妇女争取和平与自由的斗争时，详述了英勇的法国妇女的群众示威游行，意大利、摩洛哥、突尼西亚、北朝鲜和拉丁美洲妇女的示威游行。她说，世界妇女的团结和她们与苏联妇女的友谊正日益增长。当戈登夫人讲到全世界妇女支持苏联关于五大国裁军三分之一和关于禁止原子武器的建议时，听众掌声雷动。她指出：很多国家的妇女，向联合国提出由数百万妇女签署的申请书，支持苏联的建议。她又详述美国、西班牙、希腊和其他国家的妇女斗争以及德国的民主妇女运动。她的结语称：“我们知道：争取民主的斗争是长期的而且常常是流血的斗争，但是我们也知道，没有这种斗争，我们将永不会得到安全和幸福。”大会于听取该报告后休会。
    【新华社陕北五日电】塔斯社布达佩斯一日讯：此间顷举行庆祝第二届国际妇女大会的火炬游行，参加者有布达佩斯的妇女十万人。游行者标有号召为反对战争贩子、争取和平、民主与进步而斗争的口号，当她们走到匈牙利议会门前的广场时，国际妇女大会正在会议厅举行会议。出席国际妇女大会的代表们，曾向游行者发表演说。国际民主妇联主席戈登夫人号召妇女进行斗争，反对正在准备新战争的人们。当国际民主妇联副主席、出席妇女大会的苏联代表团团长波波娃出现在讲台上时，游行队伍即报之以雷动的欢呼。当她一提到争取和平的伟大战士——斯大林的名字时，与会者便对苏联各族人民的伟大领袖热烈欢呼。
