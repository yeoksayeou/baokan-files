Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 6th – Madam Li Dequan, wife of General Feng Yuxiang, returned via Europe on November 2nd and arrived in Harbin, the capital of the Northeast Liberated Area. On the day after her arrival, a grand welcome rally of thousands was held by women from all walks of life in Harbin. On the 25th, Madam Feng received a reporter from this agency at her residence. Despite the hardships of her journey and the unfortunate events of General Feng and her daughter's deaths and her own injuries, Madam Feng has now recovered her health and is in good spirits. She told the reporter: "Today, I have truly arrived in my own country, this is the people's country. The old China of the past was one of bureaucratic compradors, and the Chinese people had no connection with them whatsoever. If there was any, it was that they forced the people to tighten their belts to pay them grain and taxes."

When talking about the United States, Madam Feng said: "Two years in the United States taught me a clear truth: that a very small number of financial oligarchs on Wall Street control the entire United States. They monopolize the vast majority of newspapers and propaganda tools, attempting to deceive the people and prevent them from understanding the truth about Western Europe, Eastern Europe, China, Japan, and Korea. On the surface, American production still seems prosperous, but its fundamental and fatal flaw is that it is not produced to improve and raise the living standards of the majority of the people, but only to enrich a few individuals. Therefore, they desperately provoke wars, oppose the Soviet Union, and oppose communism, with the aim of making their own pockets even fatter and bigger. Despite this, the number of unemployed in the United States is increasing day by day, and the economic crisis is getting closer and closer. Why does the United States, which is considered to have a highly developed material civilization in the eyes of the general public, still have ten million illiterates? Why were there three million illiterate soldiers in the American army during World War II? Why can't black and white people eat at the same table or enter and exit through the same door in the United States? This is the truth about the so-called 'heavenly America.' However, the United States also has its progressive and bright side, which is the democratic and progressive forces in the United States represented by Wallace's Progressive Party, the American Communist Party, the American Committee for a Democratic Far Eastern Policy, the American Women's Congress, and the vast number of workers and intellectuals. This autumn, the American Committee for a Democratic Far Eastern Policy launched a movement to celebrate the victory of the Chinese people with a hundred thousand signatures, which received widespread support and endorsement. The original signatures will soon be sent to the Chinese Liberated Area. Many social celebrities and well-known people in the United States oppose the Truman Doctrine and oppose American aid to the executioner Chiang Kai-shek. A famous pastor I know said: 'I would rather lose my head, but I must say: I oppose aid to Chiang Kai-shek.' Now, Chiang Kai-shek is about to collapse, and all American aid and protection are powerless. Even the most reactionary figures like Zhou Yide feel there is not much they can do. The people are about to win complete victory!"

When the reporter asked about the circumstances of General Feng Yuxiang's death, Madam Feng said: "Last year, Mr. Feng wanted to come to the Liberated Area to stand together with the democratic parties and groups that truly seek the interests of the Chinese people and to overthrow the brutal and reactionary Chiang Kai-shek. On July 31st this year, we broke through the various obstacles of American imperialism and Kuomintang secret agents and left the United States on the Soviet ship 'Victory'. On August 15th, after loading a batch of Soviet expatriates in Alexandria, Egypt, we continued sailing to Batumi, a port on the eastern shore of the Black Sea in the Caucasus. Life on the ship was very good, like a big family, and we often had good movies to watch. At 2 pm on September 1st, the wind was very strong. As the ship was approaching Odessa on the northern shore of the Black Sea, the film projectionist on the fourth-level bottom cabin was rewinding the dozens of feet of film that had been shown. Because the rewinding speed was too fast, friction caused a fire, and a thick black smoke containing carbon monoxide billowed upwards. My third daughter, 19 years old, was running towards the stairs and was engulfed by the flames and died. Mr. Feng and I were in the same cabin at the time. When the thick smoke came, we both ran outside. But because of carbon monoxide poisoning, we couldn't run out and couldn't talk to each other. I had to run back to the room, where I fainted and lost consciousness. Soon, my son (Hongda, 18 years old) rushed into the room and carried me out, and I woke up. After that, my three children ran together to rescue Mr. Feng and immediately performed artificial respiration. But because Mr. Feng had been suffocated by carbon monoxide for too long and was older, he could not be saved. At this time, the entire ship was engulfed in flames, and we had all gone down to the lifeboats. In this critical moment, Soviet friends, even though they had some casualties themselves, still bravely and selflessly rescued Mr. Feng's body. I am very grateful for their sense of responsibility and selflessness. After arriving in Odessa, I was sent to a hospital on the Crimean Peninsula for treatment. At that time, I thought that Mr. Feng's wish was to stand together with the democratic parties and groups to fight, so I decided to cremate Mr. Feng and bring his ashes to the Liberated Area to fulfill Mr. Feng's wish. On September 6th, the Soviet government sent two special planes to take me and my children to Moscow. On September 7th, we welcomed Mr. Feng's remains at the airport and immediately went to the crematorium, where senior Soviet generals presided over the ceremony, and a solemn funeral was held with military honors." After Madam Feng recounted this painful experience to the reporter, she paused briefly and then said emotionally: "I have heard that Kuomintang secret agents have spread many rumors and insults about Mr. Feng's death, which is not surprising at all. Because very early on, Mr. Feng and the traitor and executioner Chiang Kai-shek were walking two different paths."

Finally, Madam Feng talked about her observations on the situation of women in the two worlds.

She said: "In the past few days, I have visited the Harbin flocking factory, the cardboard box factory, and various nurseries, and I have seen the true face of the people's country. In the Liberated Area, the status of women has been greatly improved, and children are valued, which is an important thing. Developing nursery services will allow women to work like men. I feel that the Soviet Union is truly a vibrant and healthy country. There, women can do what men can do. There are many female representatives in the Soviet Soviets at all levels. But how many female members are there in the US Congress? Even those few pitiful female members are still controlled by big capitalists and are not true representatives of the people. We are in a war today, and we cannot do everything ideally, but we are constantly moving forward. In the future, I am willing to learn more and live and struggle together with the people."

　　李德全返国抵哈市发表谈话谴责美蒋
  　痛斥蒋匪侮蔑冯玉祥将军
    【新华社哈尔滨六日电】冯玉祥将军夫人李德全女士，于上月二日经欧洲返回，抵达东北解放区首府哈尔滨。哈市各界妇女在其抵哈的次日，曾举行千人的盛大欢迎会。二十五日冯夫人在其寓所接见本社记者。冯夫人虽经旅途劳顿、及冯将军与女公子遇难、自己受伤等不幸遭遇，但现已恢复健康，精神良好。她告诉记者说：“今天我真正到了自己的国家，这是人民的国家。而过去的旧中国，是官僚买办的，中国人民与他们没有丝毫关系，假如有的话，这就是逼迫人民勒紧裤子给他们纳粮纳税。”在谈到美国时，冯夫人说：“在美国两年，告诉我一个鲜明的真理，这就是华尔街几个极少数的金融寡头在支配着整个美国，他们垄断了绝大多数的报纸及宣传工具，企图蒙蔽人民，使他们不了解西欧、东欧、中国、日本和朝鲜问题的真相。美国的生产，表面似乎还繁荣，但他们生产中的根本致命伤，就是他们不是为了改善与提高大多数人民的生活水平而生产，仅仅是为了少数几个人发财致富。因而他们拼命挑拨战争，反苏、反共，其目的是使自己的腰包更肥，更大。虽然如此，美国的失业者一天天的增多，经济危机一天天的靠近了。为什么在一般人心目中物质文明高度发展的美国，还有一千万文盲？为什么在二次世界大战中美国士兵中有三百万人不识字？为什么在美国黑人和白人不能在一个桌子上吃饭、由一个大门进出？这就是所谓“天堂美国”的真相。然而美国还有它进步的光明的一面，这就是华莱士的进步党、美国共产党、美国民主远东政策委员会、美国妇女大会及广大工人与知识分子所代表的美国民主进步的力量。在今年秋天，美国民主远东政策委员会曾发动了一个十万人签名的庆祝中国人民胜利的运动，这个运动得到了广泛的支持与拥护，签名的原稿不久即将送到中国解放区了。美国有很多社会名流与知名之士，反对杜鲁门主义、反对美国援助刽子手蒋介石。我认识的一个著名的牧师说：“我头可不要，但我一定要讲：我反对援助蒋介石。”现在，蒋介石即将覆亡了，美国一切援助与保护都无能为力，连最反动的周以德之流也感到没有多少办法了，人民即将全部胜利了！”当记者问起冯玉祥将军遇难的经过时，冯夫人说：“去年，冯先生就想到解放区来，与真正为中国人民谋利益的民主政党、民主团体站在一起，打倒凶残反动的蒋介石。今年七月三十一日，我们冲破了美帝国主义及国民党特务分子的百般阻挠，乘苏轮“胜利”号离开了美国。八月十五日到埃及的亚力山大港装载一批苏侨后，继续航行至黑海东岸高加索海口巴统。船上生活非常好，象一个大家庭一样，经常有很好的电影看。在九月一日下午二时，风很大，船快到黑海北岸奥德塞时，第四层底舱电影放映者，正在倒回几十丈长放完的电影拷贝，由于倒时速度太快，磨擦起火、顿时含有浓厚的氧化炭的黑烟幕冲腾而上。我的第三个女孩十九岁的孩子，正向楼梯跑，即被火焰卷走死难。冯先生当时和我在一个舱房，浓烟来后，我们都向外跑。但因一氧化炭窒息，无法跑出，亦无法彼此讲话。我只好跑回房中，已昏去不醒。不久，我的男孩（洪达，十八岁）冲进房中，将我背出，我才苏醒过来。此后，我三个孩子，又一齐跑去将冯先生救出，并立即施行人工呼吸。但因冯先生受氧化炭窒息时间太长，加上年岁较大，已无法挽救。这时，全船已火焰弥漫，我们都已下了救生艇。在此危急时期，苏联朋友自己虽也有些伤亡，但仍奋不顾身，把冯先生的遗体抢运出来。他们这种负责忘私的精神，我是非常铭感的。到奥德塞后，我被送到克里米亚半岛上一个医院里疗伤。当时，我想冯先生的志愿是要和民主政党、民主团体站在一起奋斗，因而我就决定火葬冯先生，把他的遗灰带到解放区来，以遂冯先生之愿。九月六日，苏联政府派两架专机将我和我的孩子们送到莫斯科。九月七日，我们在飞机场迎接了冯先生的遗体，并立即到火葬场去，由苏联高级将领出席主持，并以隆重的陆军仪节举行了葬礼。”冯夫人向记者叙述了这段悲痛的遭遇后，经过一阵短促的沉默，就激动地说：“我曾听说国民党的特务们对冯先生的死，曾经有过不少的造谣和侮蔑，这是丝毫不足为奇的。因为很早以来，冯先生与卖国贼刽子手蒋介石即走了两条道路。”
    最后，冯夫人谈到她对于两个世界的妇女状况的观感。
    她说：“这几天我参观了哈尔滨的絮行工厂、纸盒工厂以及各个保育院，我看见了人民国家的真实面貌。在解放区，妇女地位是大大提高了，孩子们受到重视，这是一件重要的事情。发展保育事业，妇女们才好和男人一样的工作。我感觉苏联实在是个朝气勃勃的健全的国家，在那里，男人能做的事，妇女们也能做。在各级苏维埃中有众多的女代表。可是，在美国国会中有几个女议员呢？就是那少得可怜的几个女议员，也还是受着大资本家的操纵，而不是真正人民的代表。我们今天是在战争中，还不能一切都能理想的办起来，但我们时时刻刻都在往前进步。今后我愿意多多学习和人民一齐共同生活，共同奋斗。”
