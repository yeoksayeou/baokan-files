　　New Cigarette Tax Stamps to be Implemented Starting January
　　[Reported by this newspaper] The North China People's Government issued the following order on December 4 regarding the implementation of new cigarette tax stamps:

　　It is hereby decided that starting January 1, 1949, the "North China People's Government Cigarette Tax Stamps" will be uniformly printed by the North China Tax Bureau and distributed to various tax authorities for cigarette taxation. The price and any changes to the price of these stamps will be uniformly determined and announced by the Tax Bureau, and no region shall alter them. All "cigarette tax bands" or "cigarette tax verified stamps," etc., previously used by local industry and commerce and tax bureaus shall be invalidated at the end of December. The following is also stipulated:

　　1. All levels of tax bureaus (formerly industry and commerce bureaus) shall, after setting aside the number of existing old tax bands for December usage, seal up the remaining ones, list the numbers, and report them to the Tax Bureau for disposal.

　　2. The printing plates for the original tax bands in each district (city) shall be cut off at the corners and submitted to the Tax Bureau for destruction.

　　3. Flower stamps purchased by manufacturers but not yet affixed by the end of this year shall not be allowed to continue to be used. A small remaining number may be submitted to the local tax bureau to be converted into cash at the original price to exchange for new stamps. Large quantities will be investigated for the reasons for accumulation and reported to the higher-level bureau for handling.

　　4. Cigarettes in stock at the end of this year with old tax bands already affixed may be registered with the local tax bureau, specifying the type and quantity, and sold off on a fixed schedule.

　　华北政府训令
  　明年一月起
  　实行新纸烟完税证
    【本报讯】华北人民政府十二月四日发布实行新纸烟完税证之训令如下：
    兹决定自一九四九年一月一日起，统一由华北税务总局印制“华北人民政府纸烟完税证”，发给各税务机关办理卷烟征税事宜。该证价格及变更，由税务总局统一规定，通告实行，各地区不得改变。所有各地工商、税局原使用之“卷烟税花”或“纸烟税验讫证”等，均在十二月底作废。并规定：
    一、各级税务局（原工商局同）将现存旧烟花证数字，除留十二月份使用者外，其余一律封存，列表报送税务总局，听候处理。
    二、各区（市）原印制烟花之底版，截角缴送税务总局销毁。
    三、截至本年年底，厂商已购未贴之花证，不准继续使用。其尾存少数，准予送当地税局按原价折抵现金，换取新证。大批者追查积存原因，呈报上级局处理。
    四、本年底各厂已贴旧花证之存烟，可向当地税局，登记种类，数量，并定期售完。
