　　【Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 22nd】Tokyo dispatch: Following Ichikichi Tsuchihashi, chairman of the Japan National Postal Workers' Union, joining the Japanese Communist Party (JCP) on the 6th, Suzuki, the former editor-in-chief of "Yomiuri Shimbun," recently joined the JCP and will become a Communist candidate for parliament. Suzuki is a famous Japanese writer who stood with the workers and opposed the capitalists during the large-scale labor-management dispute that broke out at the Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper in October 1946. Furthermore: The American and Japanese reactionaries continue to persecute the Japanese Communist Party. Two Communist parliamentary candidates with high prestige among voters, one being a former member of parliament and a famous Japanese writer supported by the people of Nagano Prefecture, and the other being a university professor from northeastern Japan, have been arrested for allegedly criticizing the policies of the occupation forces. In addition, three other Communist parliamentary candidates are being detained.
