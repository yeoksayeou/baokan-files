　　Classifying Rich Farmer Relatives as Middle Peasants
  　Zhang Shiyan Should Be Punished
    [Taiyue Telegraph] During the correction of deviations in the Second District of Jicheng, Taiyue, a right-leaning error occurred, where many rich peasants were wrongly classified as middle peasants and compensated. According to the review of Zhang Shiyan, a cadre in the district, the main reason for wrongly classifying rich peasants as middle peasants was the involvement of personal relatives and old friends, coupled with a deviation in the grasp of the policy on class designation. The emergence of this right-leaning error should raise vigilance. When Zhang Shiyan was correcting deviations in Tang Village, Liu Furen, a rich peasant in the village, had a large amount of exploitation. Because he was a relative of Zhang Shiyan, and Zhang Shiyan had borrowed five *dou* of grain from Liu when he had nothing to eat before, Zhang simply asked during the class designation: "When did you stop exploiting?" The person replied: "I stopped exploiting in the 28th year (1939)," and without further seeking the opinions of the masses, Liu was classified as a middle peasant and compensated with a large castrated ox. Other rich peasants, such as Chen Wanjia, were also classified as middle peasants and compensated. During the compensation of middle peasants in Xu Village, Jia Zhanyun, a rich peasant, reported a yield of 20 *shi* and exploitation of 8 *shi*. According to this calculation, he should have been classified as a rich peasant, but Zhang Shiyan quickly reminded him: "If you report a little more yield, you can be classified as a middle peasant." Jia Zhanyun immediately re-reported, and was classified as a middle peasant. The chairman of the Xu Village Peasants' Association asked him whether the class designation should be democratic. Zhang casually mumbled: "Half is democratic, and half is policy." In reality, when encountering those related to him, he would always try to classify them as middle peasants even if they were rich peasants. Naturally, there was no clear policy boundary, and no need to involve the masses. Under these circumstances, many rich peasants in the villages under Zhang Shiyan's responsibility were wrongly classified as middle peasants. Even when the district had already discovered these problems, Zhang Shiyan did not realize the seriousness of his mistakes and even tried to explain these situations as "settling landlords and rich peasants" to cover up his mistakes. Only in the final review did he realize that this was a serious mistake of losing his position and betraying the interests of the masses.
    Editor's Note: Cadres like Zhang Shiyan, who consciously stand on the position of the rich peasants and protect their interests, should be subject to disciplinary action.

　　把富农亲戚划成中农
  　张士彦该受处分
    【太岳电】太岳冀城二区在纠偏中曾发生右倾错误，把许多富农错划为中农而进行补偿。据该区干部张士彦的检讨，所以把富农错划为中农，主要是因为牵扯到私人的亲戚故旧，加之对划成份政策的掌握有偏差所致。这种右倾错误的产生，应引起警惕。张士彦在唐村纠偏时，该村富农刘福仁本来剥削量很大，因为和他是亲戚关系，以前张士彦没吃的曾借过刘五斗粮食，在划成份时、张就只简单地问：“你哪年停止剥削？”人家说：“二十八年就停止了剥削”，也不再深入征求群众意见，就把刘划为中农而补偿了一个大犍牛。另有陈万家等富农也就都成了中农而进行赔偿。在许村补偿中农时，富农贾占云自报二十石产量，剥削八石，这样一算该是富农了，张士彦赶忙提醒他说：“你要是多报点产量，就能划成中农。”贾占云立刻就重报了一下，而划成了中农。许村农会主席问他划成份是不是要实行民主？张随口支吾说：“一半是民主，一半是政策。”实际上是碰到与自己有关系的，即使是富农的也总要想法订成中农，自然无所谓明确的政策界限，也无所谓通过群众了。在这种情形下，张士彦负责的几个村子就都有不少富农错划为中农。而在区上已经发觉了这些问题时，张士彦并未觉悟到自己错误的严重，还企图把这些情况解释为“安置地富”以掩饰自己的错误，在最后检讨中才认识到这是丧失立场，背叛群众利益的严重错误。
    编者按：象张士彦这样有意识地站在富农立场并保护富农利益的干部，应当予以纪律处分。
