Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui, 27th -- Farmers in the Jin-Sui Liberated Area are actively engaged in winter production. Having learned from the lessons of last winter, when excessive land reform meetings led to neglected production, local leadership organs are paying more attention to guiding winter production this year. Farmers in some areas have even set goals of producing one "dou" of refined grain per person this winter. Due to the widespread bumper harvest of oilseeds this year, opening oil mills has become one of the main winter production activities in various regions. According to statistics from Lin County, Jing Le County, Fang Shan County, Ke Lan County, and four other counties, approximately 335 oil mills have already been opened. Lin County, which had only 23 mills last year, has now expanded to 66. Oil mill production is particularly beneficial, as it not only extracts oil but also yields a large amount of oil residue (referred to locally as "ma shen") for fertilizer. For example, the 97 oil mills in Jing Le County plan to extract 337,500 catties of oil in three months this winter, with 150,000 catties of oil being exported in addition to meeting local consumption needs. The by-product of 1.8 million catties of oil residue can provide fertilizer for nearly 30,000 mu of high-quality paddy fields.

Another major winter production activity is textile production. Textile production, which had stalled last year due to the impact of famine and the high cost of grain relative to cloth, is now being heavily restored. The six counties of He Qu, Bao De, and others in the Second District previously had over 4,000 wooden looms, most of which have been restored to production. The plan is to weave 93,300 bolts of homespun cloth this winter. Most of it will be used locally, with the remainder being purchased by the Bureau of Industry and Commerce for sale in northern Shaanxi. In order to meet market demand, the Bureau of Industry and Commerce has asked textile producers to improve the quality of their products.

Another important winter task – manure collection – is being accelerated by farmers in various regions. One method of collecting manure is called "wei shan fen," which involves piling up rotten weeds from the fields, burning them to ash, and then burying them in the soil to ferment into fertilizer. This is called "wei shan fen." Farmers in Li Shi County plan to create 1,000 kilns of "wei shan fen." In the first district of Ke Lan County, 3,135 households plan to compost 56,430 loads of stove ash this winter. The more common methods of collecting manure include picking up manure and using it as bedding for livestock pens.

The transportation industry is also developing. In the past six months, the six counties of Ke Lan and others in the Second District have mobilized more than 1,000 carts and over 4,500 livestock to participate in transportation, generating a profit of 490,000,000 agricultural currency units. On this basis, there are plans to launch another large-scale winter transportation campaign. Ke Lan County alone is preparing to mobilize 3,000 to 5,000 cattle and donkeys. Farmers in various regions have now repaired roads damaged by summer floods, allowing teams of carts and livestock to pass through.

### 组织打油、纺织、积肥、运输　晋绥重视冬季生产领导

　　组织打油、纺织、积肥、运输
  　晋绥重视冬季生产领导
    【新华社晋绥二十七日电】晋绥解放区农民正积极进行冬季生产。接受了去年冬季因进行土地改革开会太多，以致放松生产的教训，今年各地领导机关都比较重视了对冬季生产的领导。部分地区的农民已作出今冬每人生产细粮一斗的计划。由于今年油籽普遍丰收，开油房便成为各地冬季主要生产之一。据临县、静乐、方山、岢岚等四县统计，已开油房约三百三十五座；临县去年仅二十三座，今年即发展为六十六座。油房生产既榨了油，又剩下大量油渣（此间称为麻糁）作肥料，所以特别有利。如静乐九十七座油房，计划冬季三个月榨油三十三万七千五百斤，除本县吃用外，输出油十五万斤，附产油渣一百八十万斤，可供给近三万亩上好水地的肥料。
    另一个主要的冬季生产是纺织。去年由于灾荒影响粮贵布贱而陷于停顿的纺织生产，现正大量恢复中。二分区河曲、保德等六个县原有木制织布机四千余架，已大部恢复生产，计划今冬织土布九万三千三百匹，除大部自用外，其余多由工商局收购向陕北推销。为了适应市场的需要，工商局已向纺织户提出提高质量的要求。
    冬季另一个重要的工作——积肥，各地农民亦正加紧进行中。积肥的一个方法，叫做煨山粪，是把田野间的烂枳草堆积起来烧成灰，就地用泥土埋起来沤成肥料，称为“煨山粪”。离石县区农民计划煨山粪一千窖。岢岚县一区三千一百三十五户农民计划今冬煨灶灰五万六千四百三十驮。更普遍的积肥办法是拾粪、垫牲畜圈等。
    运输业也在发展中。二分区岢岚等六个县半年来曾发动大车千余辆、牲畜四千五百余头参加运输，赢利达农币四十九万万元。现在计划在这个基础上再发动大规模冬季运输。仅岢岚一县即准备发动三千到五千头牛和驴。现各地农民已修好被夏季洪水冲坏的道路，以便成队的大车和牲畜通过。
