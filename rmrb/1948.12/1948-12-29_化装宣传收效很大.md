　　Disguised Propaganda Achieves Great Results
　　[Shouyang Electric] In order to commemorate the "November 4th" New National Humiliation and encourage the masses to eliminate Yan bandit troops in Taiyuan with enthusiasm for supporting the front, Shouyang Chengguan launched a propaganda week on November 29th. Led by the Propaganda Department of the County Party Committee and the Education Section of the County Government, and absorbing members from the Chengguan Working Group, elementary school teachers, students, and on-the-job teachers near the city, a propaganda team was formed to conduct propaganda in Chengguan. The content of the propaganda: exposing the darkness and brutality of the Chiang-Yan bandit regime with living facts, and explaining our party's policy of protecting industry and commerce. The participating teachers and staff were in high spirits. For example, Zhang Jurong, an elementary school teacher, volunteered to perform storytelling with drum accompaniment the day before the propaganda, and performed the next day after practicing self-compiled (and reviewed) self-playing and self-speaking. Guo Zihuan volunteered to be the protagonist of the street play, Li Jinzhen was responsible for showing lantern slides, and Zhang Jurong, in addition to telling stories with drum accompaniment, jointly guided students in twisting the yangko dance with Li Peiying. Propaganda methods: adopting disguised propaganda, such as dressing the storyteller with drum accompaniment as an old man, leading a daughter and a fool. The street drama disguised Fan Hanjie, dressing Fan and his adjutant and guards as famine refugees, draped in burlap sacks, Fan holding cornmeal cakes, carrots, etc., attracting many viewers. As a result of this propaganda, industrialists and businessmen generally said: "After this explanation of the industrial and commercial policy, we can rest assured." (Zhao Zhengbang)

　　化装宣传收效很大
    【寿阳电】为纪念“十一月四号”新国耻与鼓励群众消灭太原阎匪的支前热情，寿阳城关特于十一月二十九号开展了宣传周。由县委宣传部协同县府教育科领导，并吸收了城关工作组、高小教员、学生、城附近在职教员等组成宣传队，在城关进行宣传。宣传的内容：拿活生生的事实揭露蒋阎匪统治的黑暗、残暴。并说明我党保护工商业政策。参加宣传的教职员们情绪很高，如高小教员张巨荣在宣传前一天即自报奋勇担负说大鼓，在自编（经审查）自打自说的练习下，第二天就出演了。郭子桓自报当街头剧的主角，李晋贞负责拉洋片，张巨荣除说大鼓外并与李培英共同指导学生扭秧歌。宣传方式：采取化装宣传，如说大鼓的拌成一老汉，引一闺女一傻小子。街头话剧装范汉杰、将范与其副官、警卫员装成逃荒样，披着麻包，范手中拿着谷面饼、红萝卜等，吸引了很多观众。这样宣传的结果，工商业者普遍的说：“经过这次解释工商政策，可放心了”。（赵政邦）
