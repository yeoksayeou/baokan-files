　　Victory News Spreads Through Villages Large and Small
　　Jinnan Uses Various Methods for Current Affairs Propaganda
　　[Jinnan Electric] To celebrate the great victories of the People's Liberation War, the Jinnan Second Military Subdistrict has extensively carried out mass propaganda and education. In October and November, the counties universally conducted propaganda among cadres and the masses, explaining the great victories on various battlefields, especially the victory in Jinan and the complete liberation of the Northeast. Everywhere, new slogans were rewritten, and various mass meetings, meals, casual chats, street talks, and poster postings were used to widely publicize the current situation. Wucheng organized winter propaganda committees in each village to lead winter propaganda and education work; using blackboard newspapers, broadcasting stations, and small theater troupes to promote victory news, support for the front, joining the army, participating in the war, winter production, etc., and mobilized the masses to write Yangko dances, clappers, flower drum operas, big drum ballads, Henan坠子 (zhuì zi, a local opera form), and folk tunes, ensuring that every victory was seen by those who could read and heard by those who could not. In addition, based on the demands of the masses, each village organized winter schools, night schools, literacy classes, and newspaper reading groups, from small groups to collectives, from neighbors to entire streets. This made winter propaganda and education work more organized and regular. At the same time, the county committees in each county printed propaganda materials in large quantities, and the Qinghe, Gucheng, and Enxian small newspapers were published regularly every three days. To specifically prepare for the New Year's entertainment, the prefectural committee's Propaganda and Liaison Department specifically studied the organization and leadership and educational content of this work at the November meeting. On the 28th, the prefectural committee also convened a meeting of cadres from directly affiliated agencies to study the organization of amateur entertainment circles. After the meeting, the prefectural committee and the commissioner's office took the lead in organizing, and now more than 60 people have signed up to participate, preparing to form Yangko dance teams, stilt walking teams, flower stick teams, orchestra teams, and drama clubs. Entertainment performances and all preparations began on the 6th of this month.
