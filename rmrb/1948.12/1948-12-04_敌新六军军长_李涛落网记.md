Record of the Capture of Li Tao, Commander of the Enemy's New Sixth Army

After the Liaoxi Campaign where Liao Yaoxiang's army corps was completely annihilated by our forces, Li Tao, the commander of the enemy's main force, the New Sixth Army, disguised himself as a "beggar" and hid for half a month, but still could not escape the dragnet set up by the People's Liberation Army.

On the evening of November 14th, a "beggar" around 40 years old, carrying a tattered bundle, walked eastward then southward along the south gate of Beizhen. He walked and looked at the women's long gown and the ragged cotton trousers he was wearing. When he reached the sentry post of a communications company of our army, he took a step and stopped, trying to sneak past. Our guard, seeing his suspicious behavior, stepped forward to question him. Hearing a southern accent, he immediately took him to the political department. There, this "beggar" unpacked his old clothes and bundle, which were crawling with lice, and took out two pieces of ragged plain clothes, a broken pen, half a packet of tooth powder, a bag of sorghum rice, and a seal engraved with "Wang Yuqi", calmly dealing with the inspection of the People's Liberation Army soldiers. He was very hungry, and when he saw the sorghum rice on the table, he grabbed a handful and stuffed it into his mouth. During the interrogation, he first said that he was a "refugee" returning to Jinzhou from Shenyang, and then said that he was a "clerk" from the pseudo-Tieling County government, named Wang Yuqi, from Xianning, Hubei, and wanted to go home to see his old mother. But when the interrogation officer asked him to write down the list of section chiefs and above of the pseudo-Tieling County government, he hesitated for a long time, and always wrote the name of each section chief slowly.

The interrogation officer picked up the list he had written and suddenly asked him, "What is the name of the education section chief?" He was stunned, his face turned red and white, and he actually dragged the name of the finance section chief under the education section chief. Later, he answered the name of the civil affairs section chief as the construction section chief, stammering nonsensically for a while, and did not answer a single name correctly. At this time, the interrogation officer could not help laughing, and this "beggar" and "clerk" gradually became flustered, sweating profusely.

When asked, "Do you think the Northeast People's Liberation Army fought well this time?" he replied, "Your army's tactics are quite good, and the equipment is excellent." His mouth full of military jargon exposed the secret of this "clerk." So, the interrogation officer asked him for his ID card, and he replied in a hurry: "Lost in Hujiawopeng." The interrogation officer knew that Hujiawopeng was the location of Liao's army corps' command post when it was annihilated. The interrogation officer then explained to him our army's policy of leniency towards prisoners and told him that Liao Yaoxiang was also captured nearby and was now very safe, and asked him to admit it directly. At this time, this "clerk" frowned, his face flushed, his hands trembled, and he tearfully asked to be given "a set of military officer's uniform" before speaking. But after changing into the military uniform, he said that he was Ding Yi'an, the chief of staff of the New Sixth Army. The interrogation officer did not argue with him at this time, and took him to the courtyard where the political commissar of the unit lived. When he heard people speaking with a southern accent in the house, he hurriedly said to the interrogation officer as soon as he stepped into the room: "I am not Ding Yi'an! I am Li Tao!"

　　敌新六军军长
  　李涛落网记
    廖耀湘兵团在辽西被我全歼后，蒋匪主力之主力的新六军军长李涛化装成一个“乞丐”，东躲西藏了半个月，仍然逃不脱解放军布下的天罗地网。
    十一月十四日黄昏，一个年约四十左右的“乞丐”，背着一个破包袱，沿着北镇南关由东往南走，他边走边看自己穿的一件女式长大衫，和一条破烂不堪的棉裤。当他走到我某部通讯连的岗哨时，走一步停一步，躲躲闪闪地想绕了过去。我卫兵见其形迹鬼祟，即上前盘问，一听是南方口音，随即把他带到政治部去。在那里，这位“乞丐”解开那虱子还在爬着的破旧衣服和包袱，翻出两件破烂便衣，一支破钢笔，半包牙粉，一包高粱米饭，和一个刻着“王玉祺”的图章，沉着地应付解放军战士的检查。他十分饥饿，看到桌上放着的高粱米饭，抓了一把就往嘴里塞。在审讯中，他开始说他是由沈阳回锦州的“难民”，后来又说是伪铁岭县政府之“文书”，名叫王玉祺，家住湖北咸宁，这次是想回家看望老母亲的。但当审讯干事要他写出伪铁岭县政府科长以上的名单时，他迟疑了很久，每写一个科长的名字总是慢吞吞的。
    审讯干事拿起他写好的名单，突然问他：“教育科长叫啥？”他怔住了，脸上一阵红一阵白地竟把财政科长的名字扯到教育科长之下，以后，又把民政科长的名字答成建设科长，牛头不对马嘴地支吾了一阵，连一个名字也没有答对。这时，审讯干事不禁笑出声来，而这位“乞丐”、“文书”也逐渐显得慌张起来，急得满头是汗。
    当问他“你看这次东北解放军打的好不好”时，他答道：“贵军的战术颇佳，装备优良。”满口的军事术语，戳穿了这位“文书”的秘密。于是，审讯干事又向他要身份证，他仓卒间答道：“丢在胡家窝棚了。”审讯干事知道胡家窝棚就是廖兵团被歼时其指挥所的所在地。审讯干事便向他解释我军的宽待俘虏政策，并告诉他廖耀湘也就是在这附近被俘的，现在很平安，要他照直承认。这时这位“文书”急皱眉头，脸上通红，两手发抖，竟眼泪汪汪地要求给他“换套军官服装”以后再说。但换上军服之后，他又说他是新六军参谋长丁一安。审讯干事此时也不和他分辩，就把他往该部政治委员住的院里带。他听见屋里有南方的口音人在讲话，一踏进房门时就连忙向审讯干事说：“我不是丁一安！我是李涛！”（新华社沈阳二十九日电）
