Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 25th -- TASS dispatch: Polish Minister of Industry, Chairman of the Economic Commission, and former member of the Political Bureau of the Workers' Party, Minc, delivered a lengthy report at the unification congress of the two Polish workers' parties on the 18th, outlining the implementation of Poland's three-year economic recovery plan and the tasks of the six-year economic plan from 1950 to 1955. Regarding the results of the second year of the three-year plan—the 1948 plan—Minc pointed out that in the industrial sector, 1948 exceeded the 1947 level by more than 40%. In 1948, the industrial sector accounted for 64% of the national economy. Minc stated that the industry of People's Poland is primarily developing state-owned socialist industries that are subordinate to a unified leadership structure and based on the principles of a planned economy. In 1948, the total output of the socialist sector (state-owned industries and cooperatives) in industry accounted for 94% of the total industrial output. In the agricultural sector, in 1948, the sown area and pre-war yield per hectare had almost been reached. In the trade sector, Minc emphasized the decisive role of the planned development of trade relations with the Soviet Union in Poland's foreign trade. Minc continued that as a result of the development of the entire national economy, the number of workers has increased, and the real wages of industrial workers have exceeded pre-war levels. As a result of land reform and the abolition of all farmer debts, and thanks to government assistance to poor and middle peasants, the material well-being of working peasants has also improved considerably.

　　波三年计划进行顺利
  　工业水平较去年增百分之四十
    播种面积产量均已达战前标准
    【新华社陕北二十五日电】塔斯社讯：波兰工业部长、经济委员会主席、原工人党政治局委员明兹，十八日在波兰两工人政党统一大会上作长篇报告，讲述波兰经济复兴三年计划执行的情形及一九五○至一九五五年六年经济计划的任务。在谈及三年计划的第二年——一九四八年计划执行的结果时，明兹指出：在工业方面，一九四八年已超过一九四七年水平的百分之四十以上。一九四八年，工业部分占全国经济的百分之六十四。明兹称：人民波兰的工业，正首先发展从属于单一领导机构的、并以计划经济原则为基础的国营社会主义工业。一九四八年、工业中社会主义部分（国营工业和合作社）的总生产量，占全部工业总生产量的百分之九十四。在农业方面，一九四八年已几乎达到战前的播种面积和战前每公顷的产量。在贸易方面，明兹着重指出有计划地发展对苏贸易关系在波兰对外贸易中所起的决定性作用。明兹继称：由于全部国民经济发展的结果，工人的数目已经增加，工业工人的实际工资已超过战前水平。由于土地改革和废除农民一切债务的结果，又由于政府对贫农和中农的帮助，劳动农民的物质幸福也已相当可观地改善了。
