　　A recent series of news items illustrates that the U.S. economy is becoming increasingly treacherous. According to an "Associated Press Business Week" report on November 20th: "U.S. retail sales have fallen below last year's levels for two consecutive weeks, because after meeting basic needs, the average family no longer has surplus purchasing power." Furthermore, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture statistics, agricultural capitalists' profits in October of this year were 3% lower than in the same period last year, "reflecting the drop in agricultural product prices" (TASS). At the same time, the Marshall Plan – regarded by the U.S. ruling clique as a magic weapon for curing the economic crisis – is also ineffective. According to a recent report by the U.S. Department of Commerce, although the U.S. has nearly $7 billion in foreign "aid" this year, the total export volume in the first nine months of this year has decreased by 19% compared with the same period last year. Due to rising prices and the devaluation of the dollar, the actual rate of decline is, of course, even greater. This shrinking domestic and foreign market is making the U.S.'s relative overproduction crisis increasingly apparent. According to a U.S. Information Service report citing private commercial statistics agencies, the U.S. has "exceeded current demand" in dozens of industries including cotton textiles, wool textiles, machinery, sugar, wine, and electric refrigerators. The resulting relative overproduction continues to lead to production cutbacks and increased unemployment. Even the greatly understated official U.S. statistics cannot but admit the falsity of so-called "full employment." These official statistics admit that officially registered unemployment has reached 2.2 million, and partial employment is estimated at 8 million. The United States' poor economic situation has alarmed the big American capitalists. The U.S. big capitalists' *Business Daily* says: "We are now living on a volcano that could erupt at any time." The *Barron's Magazine*, a Wall Street publication, clamorously calls out: "A 'rearmament program' must be used to avoid the trend of economic depression" (Dentsu, November 25).

### 美国经济日趋险恶　大资本家说他们正活在火山上

　　美国经济日趋险恶
  　大资本家说他们正活在火山上
    最近的一连串消息说明：美国经济正日趋险恶。据美联社十一月廿日发表的“一周商情”透露：“美国在零售业已接连两周降至去年水平以下，因为一般家庭在主要物品满足后，已无余裕的购买力”。另据美农业部统计，今年十月份农业资本家的利润，较去年同期降低百分之三，“反映了农产品价格的跌落”（塔斯社）。同时，美国统治集团看作医治经济危机的法宝之一——马歇尔“对外援助”计划，亦并不有效。据美商务部最近的报告，美国今年虽有近七十亿美元的对外“援助”，但今年头九个月的出口总额，较去年同期已下降百分之十九。由于物价上涨和美元贬值，实际下降的比率，当然更大。这种国内外市场的日趋缩小，使美国相对的生产过剩的危机，日益明显。据美新闻处引私人商业统计机关的报告，美国的棉织、毛织、机器、糖、酒、电汽冰箱等数十种工业生产，“已超过目前需求”。生产相对过剩的结果，继续引起生产的缩减和失业人数的增多。美官方大大缩小了的统计，亦不能不自承所谓“充分就业”的虚伪。这一官方统计承认：正式登记的失业人数达二百二十万人，部分就业的估计有八百万人。美国恶劣的经济情况，使美国的大财主们发急。美国大资本家的商务日报说：“我们现在正生活在一座火山上，随时都有爆发的可能”。华尔街机关刊拜龙杂志则狂妄地呼号：“必须‘用重整军备计划’来避免经济萧条的趋势”（电通社十一月二十五日电）。
