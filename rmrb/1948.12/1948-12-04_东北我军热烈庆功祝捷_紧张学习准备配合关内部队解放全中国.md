　　Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 1st. In recent days, units of the Northeast People's Liberation Army have enthusiastically convened celebration and victory-hailing conferences. When the "Lanzhou" unit held its celebration conference, more than two thousand eight hundred meritorious personnel, wearing glorious red victory flowers, after listening to the report from the leaders conveying the assessment of the Chinese military situation by the responsible person of the CCP Central Committee, were all jubilant, encouraged, and extremely excited. At the victory celebration and mobilization training meeting of the eighth detachment of the "Service" unit, the leaders especially commended the 605 outstanding meritorious personnel who had emerged one after another in the entire detachment, 170 of whom had performed meritorious service in this autumn offensive. The leaders personally put medals on them and gave them prizes. In his speech, a certain leader earnestly told everyone to continue their efforts, intensify their studies, improve themselves, and help new comrades learn tactics and improve their political awareness, so as to cooperate with brother troops inside the Pass to liberate all of China in the future. The "Advance" newspaper of this unit pointed out in an editorial entitled "Celebrating the Great Victory of the Autumn Offensive": We should not be proud and slack because of victory, but should, on the basis of victory, become more tense, quickly strive to enlist liberated soldiers, strengthen our troops, skillfully master the new equipment seized from the enemy, and give full play to the tenacious combat style of continuous marching and fighting, and not fearing hardship, in the autumn offensive, so that the combat effectiveness of the troops continues to improve one step further. In this autumn offensive, the "Advanced" unit marched more than two thousand miles and annihilated more than eleven thousand enemies. At the victory celebration conference of cadres above the company level of this unit, the political commissar of the unit called on everyone not to be proud because of victory, and to do the following tasks well: (1) Mobilize ideologically, and do not slacken our fighting spirit because of victory, and we will not stop until we have completely eliminated the Kuomintang reactionaries. (2) Unite, help, and educate new soldiers. (3) Review disorganized and undisciplined behavior and further improve the concentration and unity of the troops. (4) Further improve the technical and tactical skills of the troops.
