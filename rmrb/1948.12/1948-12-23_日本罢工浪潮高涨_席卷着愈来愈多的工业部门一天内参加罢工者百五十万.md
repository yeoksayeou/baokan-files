Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, December 21st: TASS, Tokyo, December 16th: The strike movement in Japan is growing and becoming larger in scale. In November alone, between 7 and 8 million Japanese workers were involved in labor disputes. On December 15th alone, 1.5 million workers went on strike. The strike wave is sweeping through more and more industrial sectors. A large-scale strike by electrical workers demanding improved working conditions began in Tokyo on December 13th. The strike has had a significant impact on large factories that use a lot of electricity. Tram traffic in the Nanjing district is only partially operational. Electrical workers in the central, Kansai, China, and Hokuriku regions are planning to strike soon. The All-Japan Miners' Union, with 75,000 members, the All-Japan Seamen's Union, and the All-Japan Automobile Workers' Union, with 60,000 members, have all gone on strike. The Japan Federation of Private Railway Workers and the All-Japan Textile Workers' Union, with 160,000 members, plan to announce a strike early next week.
