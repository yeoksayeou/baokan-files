(Jinan News) The Qinghe County Party Committee Propaganda Department and the Study Committee, after seeing the North China Bureau's decision on on-the-job cadre education, immediately called on all subordinate study groups to conduct earnest discussions; and, based on the spirit of the document, combined this with a review of past study attitudes. The review revealed that in the past, people generally didn't use their brains when studying, felt that studying was a burden, and held an attitude of merely going through the motions. Thinking was limited to narrow local experiences, understanding of the national victory situation was insufficient, and very little attention was paid to improving political and theoretical levels. The Study Committee, based on the group discussions, also conducted self-criticism: In the past, it had simply emphasized collective study and discussion, and neglected self-study. During discussions, some people didn't speak, while others didn't prepare beforehand and spoke randomly, digressing endlessly and failing to reach correct conclusions. When studying policies and lines, they couldn't connect them with concrete practical problems. After the self-criticism, a new study plan was formulated based on the cultural and political-theoretical level of all cadres, dividing them into Class A and Class B. Regular study then commenced.

　　清河检查干部学习过分强调集体讨论
    【冀南讯】清河县委宣传部和学委会看到华北局关于在职干部教育的决定后，立即号召所属各学习小组切实讨论；并根据文件的精神结合检查过去的学习态度。检查的结果是：过去对学习一般不用脑子，感觉学习是负担，抱着应付的态度。思想停止在狭小的局部经验上，对于全国胜利的形势认识不足，对提高政治、理论水平注意很差。学委会根据小组讨论，也作了自我检讨：过去单纯强调了集体学习讨论，忽视了自学。讨论时有的不发言，有的事前没有准备，乱提乱说，扯的无边无际，不能得出正确的结论，学习政策、路线时不能和具体实际问题结合。经过检讨，即根据全体干部文化、政治理论水平的高低，订出新的学习计划，划分为甲乙两班。开始正规学习。
