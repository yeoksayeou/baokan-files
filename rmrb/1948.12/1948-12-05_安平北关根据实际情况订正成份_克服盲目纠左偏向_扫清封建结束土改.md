    Anping Beiguan Corrects Class Designations Based on Actual Conditions
    Overcoming Blind "Leftist" Errors, Eliminating Feudalism, and Completing Land Reform
    [Our Paper’s Dispatch] Reporter Qian Feng reports: The work team in Beiguan Village, Anping County, Jizhong District, in carrying out the work of completing land reform, closely relied on the poor and lower-middle peasants to unite with the middle peasants, conducted in-depth investigations and analysis of the situation, discovered the problems in the village's rectification of deviations and the incomplete elimination of feudalism, and correctly implemented the work of completing land reform.
    On the twelfth of last month, the work team arrived in Beiguan Village, a village of less than a hundred households. The poor and lower-middle peasants and some of the middle peasants greeted them with a cold and discriminatory attitude. “Return what should be returned to them, what else is there to say? Anyway, it's just that little bit of stuff, once it’s returned, it’s over!” Li Xinjiang's mother, a poor military dependent before land reform, said this during the work team's visit, representing the general sentiment of the poor and lower-middle peasants in the village. Most of them avoided the work team when they saw them, and didn't talk much even when they couldn't escape. The general opinion of the middle peasants was: "You decide who should get what back, and who shouldn't." They whispered among themselves: "Who knows how long these meetings will last this winter!" Seeing this phenomenon, the work team, on the one hand, held symposiums for the poor and lower-middle peasants to explain the full content of completing land reform and democratic party rectification, and on the other hand, went deep into the branch and among the poor, lower-middle, and middle peasants, adopting various methods to understand the causes of this phenomenon. At the symposiums for the poor and lower-middle peasants, apart from the work team's speeches, the general farmers adopted a silent attitude. Among them, only Zhang Gengyin's household, which was classified as a rich peasant during land reform last year and reclassified as a middle peasant this spring when land reform was being completed, actively questioned what his class designation actually was. During in-depth individual visits, the work team discovered the inside story. It turned out that during land reform last year, six landlord households and two rich peasant households were classified in this village. It now appears that the determination of these landlord and rich peasant class designations was mostly correct, but before the autumn this year, district cadres came and shouted "rectify deviations" during the completion of land reform. Without understanding the actual situation and without going through the masses, they rashly reduced all the landlords and rich peasants to two rich peasant households and one landlord household, classifying the rest as middle peasants. In this way, the landlords and rich peasants who slipped through the net became happy and greatly satirized and insulted the poor and lower-middle peasants. Zhang Gengyin, while driving a large ox on the street, said: "The ox is still mine. I help those who haven't turned over to thresh, but I won't help those who have turned over (referring to the poor and lower-middle peasants)." Some even threatened: "They took my things. This time, they'll be blowing horns and sending them back to me!" Although there were no horns blown at the time, they personally went to the homes of those who had turned over, rummaging through boxes and cabinets under the support of the cadres, taking things back one by one. After taking these things back, they quietly auctioned them off. After learning about the above situation, the work team, on the one hand, further collected materials to study the classification of classes in the village; on the other hand, mobilized the poor and lower-middle peasants to unite with the middle peasants and widely publicized the standards for class designation. The results of the work team's internal research on the class composition of the whole village revealed that the elimination of feudalism was not thorough. For example, take Zhang Gengyin. During the "July 7th" Incident, he had ten people in his family, fifty-six mu of land, usually hired a long-term laborer, and did not participate in major labor himself. When labor was insufficient, he hired short-term laborers as supplements. In 1945, when his son returned from the army and participated in major labor, the land was the same as before, but he still hired a long-term laborer and some short-term laborers. The amount of exploitation exceeded 25% of his total annual income, so he should be classified as a rich peasant. However, before the autumn completion of land reform, due to the cadres' blind "rectification of deviations," he was classified as a middle peasant, and everything that was confiscated last year was returned to him. Another example is Lu Laoshen. During the "July 7th" Incident, he had fourteen people in his family, ninety-six mu of land, one person participated in major labor, and he also hired a long-term laborer and a large number of short-term laborers. In 1945, when the family split up, Lu Laoshen and his wife were allocated forty-three mu of land, five mu were rented out, and the rest was managed by hiring laborers. He himself did not participate in major labor and should be classified as a landlord, but in the past, he was classified as a rich peasant. According to the preliminary classification results, there were not only two rich peasant households in the village, but also seven landlord households (four of which were bankrupt). This fact aroused the vigilance of the work team. They decided to do two things first: one was to convene a meeting of poor and lower-middle peasants to express their attitude to them; the other was to hold winter schools to widely mobilize the middle peasants to participate and explain to them the standards for class designation and the policy of uniting with the middle peasants. Of the forty poor and lower-middle peasant households in the village, less than thirty attended the first meeting, most of them attending with a tentative mentality to see which way the wind was blowing. Many old ladies used this kind of language to test the work team's attitude: "Return what should be returned to them, what else is there to say?!" A seventy-one-year-old man said: "We are all the same, not seeking merit, but seeking no fault, return it to them!" At this time, Wang Ji, the leader of the work team, sincerely explained to them that the poor and lower-middle peasants were one family and the reasons for returning or compensating the wrongly struggled middle peasants. He further clearly pointed out that the work of completing land reform included compensating for the losses of wrongly struggled middle peasants and resettling the landlords and rich peasants for production. Another extremely important content was to continue to eliminate feudalism. Therefore, completing land reform was not equal to rectifying deviations.... The work team was always standing with the poor and lower-middle peasants. At the end of the meeting, the atmosphere began to change, and many old ladies took the hands of the female comrades in the work team and asked them their names. The number of people attending the second meeting of poor and lower-middle peasants increased to nearly forty. When the work team explained what the feudal class was, the poor peasant Li Liantai stood up and said: "I'm afraid we won't remember what was said, so let's use what this comrade said to evaluate whether there is feudalism in our village!" This sentence was approved by everyone. But then a woman proposed: "It won't work to discuss it like this without forming groups. Last year, even with groups, some leaked!" At that time, some women turned their attention to Li Dan's daughter-in-law, because although Li Dan was a poor peasant, his daughter-in-law's family was a landlord, and she had just been married for less than half a year, so she was asked to withdraw from the meeting. Because the work team's attitude was clear and the middle peasant policy was constantly clarified at the meetings of poor and lower-middle peasants, the indifferent attitude of the middle peasants was also beginning to change. Of the forty middle peasant households in the village, thirty-eight have already participated in winter school. After the work team explained the standards for class designation that night, the middle peasant Zhang Wanchun also automatically proposed: "Let's use the real facts of our village to evaluate it!" At that time, everyone proposed to discuss four households, including Li Lanpu, Lu Laoshen, Zhang Gengyin, and Ma Laojun, but due to time constraints, only the two households of Li Lanpu and Ma Laojun were discussed. These two households were evaluated as landlords, and the results were consistent with the work team's investigation, but there were a few supplements in the specific circumstances. The village is now studying how to continue to eliminate feudalism and complete the major task of completing land reform.
    　  　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    Editor's Note: The work of completing land reform led by the Beiguan work team reminds us that in the current work of completing land reform, it is not just a simple correction of "leftist" deviations, compensation, and resettlement, but also attention should be paid to mobilizing the masses to prevent rightist tendencies and to whether feudalism has been completely eliminated. Only by resolutely implementing the line of relying on the poor and uniting with the middle peasants can we guarantee the correct implementation of our party's policies. The Beiguan experience proves that the work team must conduct a full investigation and analysis of the specific class situation in the local area, not only compensating what should be compensated and resettling what should be resettled, but also continuing to confiscate or requisition what should be continued to be confiscated or requisitioned. If we ignore the actual situation and blindly rectify deviations, without specifically studying the sources of compensation, regardless of the object, and compensating and resettling across the board, we will inevitably produce rightist deviations. This is worth noting in all areas.

　　安平北关根据实际情况订正成份
  　克服盲目纠左偏向  扫清封建结束土改
    【本报讯】记者千峰报导：冀中区安平北关工作组，在进行结束土改工作中，紧紧依靠贫雇团结中农，深入调查分析情况，发现该村纠偏中的毛病和消灭封建不彻底，正确执行了结束土改工作。
    上月十二日，工作组到达这个不满百户的北关村，贫雇农及一部分中农以冷淡和歧视的态度来迎接了他们。“该退的给人家退吧，还说什么？反正就是那点东西，退完了就算完了！”土改前的贫苦军属李心江他娘，在工作组访问时说出了这样的话，这代表该村一般贫雇农的心理。他们大多数是见了工作组就回避，实在不能脱身时也不多谈。一般中农的意见则是：“你们看着该给谁退就退，不该退就不退。”他们三三五五的私语着：“今年冬天开会又不知道开到什么时候哩！”工作组看到这种现象，于是一方面召开中贫农座谈会说明结束土改及民主整党的全部内容，一方面深入支部及贫雇、中农各阶层中，采用各种方式了解造成这种现象的原因。在中贫农座谈会上除工作组发言外，一般农民都采取了沉默的态度，其中只有去年土改被划为富农而今年春天结束土改时被改订为中农的张更银一户，积极的起来质问他倒底是什么成份。工作组在深入的个别访问中，发现了问题的内幕。原来去年土改时这村划分了六户地主，两户富农，这些地富的成份的确定，现在看来大部是正确的，但今年秋前结束土改中区干部来到大喊“纠偏”，没有了解实际情况，没有通过群众，将所有地富草率的减缩为两户富农，一户地主，其余都划入中农行列。这样，漏网的地富高兴起来，对贫雇农大肆讽刺污辱，张更银一面赶着大犋牛在街上走一面说：“牛还是我的，我帮助没翻身的碾场，就是不帮助那些翻了身的（指贫雇农）。”甚至有的更扬言：“拿了我的东西，这回看着他们吹着喇叭给我送回来！”当时虽然没有吹喇叭，但他们在干部的支持下亲自到翻身户家里翻箱倒柜，一件件的收拾回去。这些东西拿回去后，接着就悄悄拍卖了。工作组了解了上述情况后，一方面进而搜集材料研究划分该村阶级成份；一方面发动贫雇农民团结中农，广泛的宣传划阶级标准。工作组内部研究全村成份的结果，发现封建消灭不彻底。如以张更银来说，“七七”事变时十口人，五十六亩地，平时雇一个长工，自己不参加主要劳动，劳力不足时雇短工补助。到一九四五年他儿子当兵回来，参加了主要劳动，土地和以前相等，但仍雇一个长工及部分短工，剥削量超过了他全年总收入的百分之二十五，应划为富农。但秋前结束土改时，由于干部盲目的“纠偏”，逐把他划入中农，去年被征收的东西也全部退了回去。又如逯老深，“七七”事变时十四口人，九十六亩地，一个人参加主要劳动，另外雇有一个长工及大量短工。到一九四五年时分家，逯老深两口人分得四十三亩地，五亩出租，其余雇工经营，自己不参加主要劳动，应划为地主，但过去却划成富农。根据初步划分的结果，全村不只两户富农，还有七户地主（四户是破户了的）。这一事实引起了工作组的警惕，当决定先做两件事情：一是召集贫雇会议向他们表明态度；一是举办冬学广泛动员中农参加，向他们讲解划阶级的标准及团结中农的政策。全村四十户贫雇农第一次到会的尚不足三十个，多是抱着看风头的试探心理来参加的，许多老太太用这种话语来试探工作组的态度：“该退的给人家退吧，还有什么话说？！”一个七十一岁的老汉说：“咱们都是一样，不求有功，但求无过，给人家退吧！”这时工作组组长王计同志诚恳的向他们说明了中贫农是一家及退补错斗中农的道理，进而明白的指出结束土改的工作，一方面包括退补错斗中农的损失、安置地富生产，另外还有一个极其重要的内容是继续消灭封建。因此结束土改不等于就是纠偏………，工作组是始终和贫雇农站在一起的。会议的最后，空气开始变化了，许多老太太拉着工作组里女同志的手问他们叫什么名字。第二次贫雇农会议人数增加到将近四十个，当工作组讲解了什么是封建阶级时，贫农李连太站起来说：“怕说了咱们记不住，现在咱就拿这个同志说的来评评咱村上有没有封建吧！”这句话得到了全体赞成。但接着一个妇女提出：“就这样讨论不编组可不行，去年编了还有跑气的呢！”当时有些妇女把眼光注视到李旦家媳妇身上，原因是李旦虽是贫农成份，但他媳妇娘家是地主，刚刚结婚不满半年，所以就叫她退出会外。由于工作组的态度明确，加以中贫农会议上对于中农政策的不断阐明，所以目前中农淡漠的态度也在开始转变。全村四十户中农，参加冬学的已有三十八个，当晚工作组讲解了划阶级的标准后，中农张万春也自动的提出：“咱们拿咱村的实事来评评吧！”当时大家提出李兰普、逯老深、张更银、马老俊等四户来讨论，但因时间关系只讨论了李兰普及马老俊两户，该两户被评为地主，结果与工作组的考察是一致的，只是在具体情况上有少许补充。现该村正在研究如何继续消灭封建，完成结束土改的重大任务。
    　  　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    编者按：北关工作组领导的结束土改工作，提示了我们在当前结束土改工作中不只是单纯的纠正左偏，补偿安置，同时还要注意发动群众防止右倾和注意封建是否彻底消灭，只有坚决执行依靠贫雇团结中农的路线，才能保证我党政策正确实施。北关经验证明工作组必须对当地具体阶级情况作充分调查和分析，不但该补偿的补偿，该安置的安置，同时该继续没收或征收的还应继续没收或征收，如果不顾实际实况，只是盲目的去纠偏，不具体研究补偿来源，不顾对象，不加区别地一律补偿安置，就必然产生右的偏向。这是值得各地注意的。
