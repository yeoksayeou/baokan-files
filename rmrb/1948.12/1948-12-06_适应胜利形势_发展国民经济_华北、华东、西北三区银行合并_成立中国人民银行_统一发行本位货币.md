　　[Our Special Dispatch] In view of the current development situation and to meet the needs of national economic construction, the North China People's Government passed a resolution at its third political affairs meeting on November 18 to establish the People's Bank of China, unify the issuance of currency, and appoint Nan Hanchen as the General Manager of the People's Bank of China. The North China People's Government has issued a public notice regarding this matter, the original text of which is as follows:
　　In order to adapt to the needs of national economic construction, and with the consent of the Shandong Provincial Government and the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia and Jin-Sui Border Region Governments, it is decided to unify the currencies of the North China, East China, and Northwest China regions. The decision is as follows:
　　1. The North China Bank, the Beihai Bank, and the Northwest Peasant Bank shall be merged into the "People's Bank of China," with the original North China Bank as the head office. All currencies issued by the three banks and all their external creditor's rights and debts shall be assumed by the People's Bank of China.
　　2. Starting from December 1st of this year, the People's Bank of China banknotes (hereinafter referred to as new currency) shall be issued and designated as the base currency for the North China, East China, and Northwest China regions, and shall be uniformly circulated. All public and private receipts and payments, as well as all transactions, shall be denominated in the new currency. After the issuance of the new currency, the Ji currency (including Luxi currency), Bian currency, Beihai currency, and Xibei Nongmin currency (hereinafter referred to as old currency) shall be gradually withdrawn. Before the old currency is withdrawn, the old currency and the new currency shall have a fixed exchange rate and shall continue to circulate as before, and shall not be refused. The exchange rate between the new and old currencies is specified as follows:
　　(1) The exchange rate between the new currency and the Ji currency and the Beihai currency is 1 to 100, i.e., one yuan of the People's Bank of China banknote is equal to 100 yuan of the South Hebei Bank banknote or the Beihai Bank banknote.
　　(2) The exchange rate between the new currency and the Bian currency is 1 to 1,000, i.e., one yuan of the People's Bank of China banknote is equal to 1,000 yuan of the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region Bank banknote.
　　(3) The exchange rate between the new currency and the Xibei Nongmin currency is 1 to 2,000, i.e., one yuan of the People's Bank of China banknote is equal to 2,000 yuan of the Northwest Peasant Bank banknote.
　　It is hoped that our military and civilians will abide by the above regulations. If anyone refuses to use the new currency or privately sets exchange rates, speculates for profit, or disrupts the financial order, they will be severely punished without leniency once discovered. This is hereby announced.

　　适应胜利形势·发展国民经济
    华北、华东、西北三区银行合并
    成立中国人民银行  统一发行本位货币
    【本报特讯】华北人民政府鉴于目前形势的发展，为适应国民经济建设之需要，于十一月十八日第三次政务会议通过决议，成立中国人民银行，统一发行货币，并任命南汉宸为中国人民银行总经理。华北人民政府为此事特发出布告，原文如下：
    为适应于国民经济建设之需要，特商得山东省政府、陕甘宁、晋绥两边区政府之同意，统一华北、华东、西北三区货币。兹决定：
    一、华北银行、北海银行、西北农民银行，合并为“中国人民银行”，以原华北银行为总行，所有三行发行之货币，及其对外之一切债权债务均由中国人民银行负责承受。
    二、于本年十二月一日起，发行中国人民银行钞票（下称新币），定为华北、华东、西北三区的本位货币，统一流通。所有公私款项收付、及一切交易，均以新币为本位币。新币发行之后，冀币（包括鲁西币）、边币、北海币、西农币（下称旧币），逐渐收回，旧币未收回之前，旧币与新币固定比价，照旧流通，不得拒用。新旧币之比价规定如下：
    （一）新币对冀币、北海币均为一比一百，即中国人民银行钞票一元，等于冀南银行钞票或北海银行钞票一百元。
    （二）新币对边币为一比一千，即中国人民银行钞票一元，等于晋察冀边区银行钞票一千元。
    （三）新币对西农币为一比二千，即中国人民银行钞票一元，等于西北农民银行钞票二千元。
    以上规定望我军民人等一体遵行，如有拒绝使用或私定比价，投机取巧，扰乱金融者，一经查获，定予严惩不贷，切切此布。
