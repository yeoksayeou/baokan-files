    Lin County Concludes Land Reform, Combining Preliminary Experience of Party Rectification

    [This Newspaper's Report] In the process of completing land reform in over a hundred villages in Taihang District's Lin County before the autumn harvest, preliminary experience has been gained, proving that completing land reform must be carried out in conjunction with party rectification to be successful; conversely, if land reform is simply carried out, and party rectification is seen as something for the next stage, the result will inevitably be poor. We now introduce its preliminary experience as follows:

  I. Clarify the Confused Ideas of Party Members and the Masses Regarding Land Reform and Party Rectification, and Initially Adjust the Organizations of Party Branches and Farmers' Associations.

    The first obstacle encountered in Lin County's completion of land reform was the resistance of various thoughts from party members and the masses, sectarian contradictions, and a certain degree of extreme democratization. Therefore, the party's correct policies on land reform, party rectification, and democracy must first be fully educated and fermented both inside and outside the party, and after investigation and study to determine the situation, then adopt criticism and self-criticism from inside the party to outside, from bottom to top and from top to bottom, gradually raising the awareness of party members and the masses, and specifically solving the following problems ideologically: (1) First, within the party branch, examine the relationship between the party and the masses in the most recent half-year, so that passive party members recognize that it is wrong to abandon their leadership of the masses, resulting in losses to the work in the village. At the same time, launch discussions within the farmers' association to make everyone aware of the harm of extreme democratization without leadership, policies, or systems, which allows bad elements to exploit loopholes. The district and village leadership conducted appropriate reviews of the state of laissez-faire in their work. (2) Mobilize the branch to review the relationship between the party and the masses historically. First, affirm the active role and achievements of party members in the anti-feudal struggle, and at the same time point out the shortcomings and errors of some party members who are arrogant, undemocratic in their work style, occupy too many fruits of struggle, engage in sectarianism, and harm the interests of the masses, proving that when they are correct, the masses support them, and when they are incorrect, the masses do not support them. Guide party members to carry out criticism and self-criticism, distinguish the advantages and disadvantages of each party member, at which time good party members will actively carry out self-criticism, recognize the impurity of thoughts, work styles, and composition within the party, realize that party rectification is necessary, and affirm the achievements of past party rectification; ordinary party members with errors are also happy to accept criticism and correct their errors because their advantages are affirmed, and truly hidden individual bad elements within the party and those who insist on errors are isolated. In this way, a certain degree of sectarian antagonism within some branches can be easily resolved, and at the same time, through active and better party members taking the initiative to unite the farmers' association and the active and better elements within the past poor peasant leagues, and through sincere mutual review, the antagonistic state of some branches and poor peasant leagues can also be easily eliminated. (3) Summarize the land reform work of the entire village, first inspire everyone to conduct realistic free discussions within the branch and the farmers' association, and then make everyone first affirm the great achievements of land reform, and at the same time appropriately expose the left-leaning errors in land reform such as infringing on the interests of middle peasants, infringing on industrialists and businessmen, and not resettling landlords and rich peasants. On the other hand, guide everyone to analyze the production emotions of various classes since land reform, so that everyone realizes that the struggle face was too large in land reform, isolating themselves and affecting various strata who are afraid to actively produce; in this way, from the interests of the masses of the entire village, everyone consciously recognizes why deviation correction is necessary. When discussing among the masses, branch party members should actively solicit opinions from the masses and appropriately conduct public self-criticism. (4) Conduct current affairs education and education on the future of the revolution inside and outside the party, analyze the changes that have taken place in the strength of the enemy and ourselves, and make everyone understand that the revolution is about to win nationwide, eliminating the feelings of weariness that exist among some party members and the masses. Some party members recalled the history of heroic struggle in the past difficult environment, and said sadly, "We worked unyieldingly even in the past when it was so difficult, how can we not work when victory is near?"

    After ideological mobilization inside and outside the party, a group of better and more active elements will inevitably emerge. On this basis, unite them, rely on them, initially re-elect the leadership of the branch, and initially rectify the organization of the farmers' association, then establish a temporary people's congress, and under the leadership of the branch, rely on the people's congress to officially carry out the work of completing land reform. This stage of ideological mobilization and organizational adjustment inside and outside the party is of decisive significance to the entire movement process.

  II. In the Concrete Implementation of the Work of Completing Land Reform, it is Necessary to Carry Out a Two-Line Struggle and Implement Policy Education.

    The experience of many villages in Lin County proves that the thoughts of party members and the masses cannot be completely cleared at once, and they often sway when encountering specific problems, either left or right; therefore, in order to implement the party's correct policies, it is necessary to specifically carry out a two-line struggle. In particular, it is necessary to call on every party member within the party to abide by the resolutions of the people's congress and become a model for implementing policies; comrades with errors must correct their errors in the process of completing land reform. For example, after the temporary people's congress was established, the first task was to review and revise the class status of those who had been struggled against. At this time, those related to those who had been struggled against tried to lower their class status and give more compensation; conversely, some tried to raise their class status to avoid giving them "compensation."

    For example, when discussing the principles of "resettlement," "compensation," and "adjustment," some of the masses advocated supplementing to a certain level indiscriminately; some attached importance to adjusting land to poor and hired peasants and disregarded compensating middle peasants and resettling landlords and rich peasants; some valued "resettlement" and "compensation" and disregarded adjusting land to poor and hired peasants. For example, when mobilizing turned-over households to withdraw over-distributed fruits and resettle landlords and rich peasants, if it is not appropriate, it is easy to develop a right-leaning tendency to attack the poor and hired peasants, etc. Therefore, we must be very cautious in these aspects and carry out a two-line struggle at any time.

  III. Launch Mass Inspection and Summary, and Push the Movement in the Direction of Production and Construction and Party Building and Political Power.

    When the completion of land reform is basically completed, launch a mass inspection and summary movement, widely solicit opinions from the masses on this completion of land reform, prepare to revise inappropriate places, and use it as a final decision; and after measuring the land, issue land certificates, and announce the end of land reform. In the summary movement, continue to improve the awareness of party members and the masses, so that they consciously and under leadership turn to the direction of organizing production and construction.

    First of all, carry out inspection and summary within the party branch, invite representatives of the masses to participate, inspect the leadership of the branch in the completion of land reform, and summarize its achievements and shortcomings, thereby systematically carrying out party rectification. Check whether each party member has wavered in implementing the party's policies since land reform and in this completion of land reform, and whether they have violated the party's resolutions and discipline. Comprehensively check the ideological work style of each party member, carry out criticism and self-criticism, listen to the opinions raised by representatives of the masses, give praise to good party members, give criticism to bad ones, and give appropriate disciplinary action to truly individual consistently bad elements and elements who are seriously detached from the masses, then on this basis, conduct democratic elections of the branch to produce a new branch committee, adhere to and consolidate the various systems of the branch gradually established in the completion of land reform. And systematically carry out the education of organizing production and construction and the party program and constitution, so that all party members have a clear direction in their actions.

    At the same time, in the inspection and summary movement, it is also necessary to mobilize the masses to criticize and inspect village cadres and representatives of the temporary people's congress to see whether they can represent their interests. Then, delineate electoral districts, register voters, carefully implement democratic elections in accordance with the draft election law stipulated by the North China Temporary People's Congress, and establish a formal people's congress and village government. According to the policies of the higher authorities and the demands of the masses, determine the major events that should be developed and reformed in the village in the future, such as rectifying cooperatives, rectifying corvee labor, formulating village regulations, etc.

    林县结束土改中
    结合整党的初步经验
    【本报讯】太行区林县在秋前一百多个村结束土改工作中，获得初步经验，证明结束土改要与整党结合进行才能作好；相反的，如单纯进行结束土改，把整党看作是下一阶段的事，结果必然很糟。兹将其初步经验，介绍于下：
  一、澄清党员和群众对土改、整党的混乱思想，初步调整党的支部
        与农会的组织。
    林县结束土改中首先遇到的障碍是党员与群众各种思想抵抗、宗派矛盾以及某种程度的极端民主化倾向。因此首先必须把党对土改、整党、民主的正确政策，在党内外进行充分的教育与酝酿，并经过调查研究、判明情况，然后采取由党内到党外，由下而上与由上而下的批评与自我批评，逐步提高党员与群众的觉悟，具体的从思想上解决下列问题：（一）首先在党的支部内检查最近半年来党与群众的关系，使消极的党员认识到自己放弃对群众的领导，以致村中工作受到损失是不对的。同时在农会内发动大家讨论，使大家认识没有领导、没有政策、没有制度的极端民主化的偏向，以致使坏分子钻了空子的害处。区村领导上对工作上的自流状态进行了适当的检讨。（二）发动支部从历史上检讨党与群众的关系。首先肯定党员在反封建斗争中的积极作用与成绩，同时指出有些党员骄傲自大、作风不民主、多占斗争果实、闹宗派、损害群众利益等缺点与错误，证明自己正确时群众拥护，自己不正确时群众也就不拥护了。引导党员开展批评与自我批评，分清每个党员的优缺点，这时好党员便积极展开自我批评，认识到党内存在着思想、作风及成份的不纯，觉悟到不整党不行，并肯定过去整党成绩；一般有错误的党员，也因肯定其优点而乐于接受批评并改正错误，真正藏在党内的个别坏分子与坚持错误者被孤立出来。这样，某些支部内某种程度的宗派对立状态，也就容易解决，同时经过积极的和较好的党员主动团结农会和过去贫农团内的积极的较好的分子，并经过互相诚恳的检讨，有些支部贫农团的对立状态亦可容易消除。（三）总结全村土改工作，先在支部与农会内启发大家进行切实的自由讨论，然后使大家首先肯定土改的伟大成绩，同时适当揭发土改中侵犯中农利益、侵犯工商业家和不安置地主富农等左倾错误。另一方面引导大家分析土改以来各阶级的生产情绪，使大家认识由于土改中斗争面过大，孤立了自己，并影响各阶层不敢积极生产；这样，从全村群众利益上，使大家自觉的认识为什么必须纠偏。在群众中讨论时，支部党员应该主动征求群众意见，并适当的公开的进行自我批评。（四）在党内外进行时事教育，与革命前途的教育，分析敌我力量已起的变化，使大家了解革命将要在全国胜利，扫除某些党员与群众中存在着的厌倦情绪。有些党员回忆过去困难环境下英勇斗争的历史，很沉痛的说：“过去那样困难还不屈不挠的干，快胜利了难道能不干？”
    党内外经过思想发动，必然会涌现一批较好的积极分子，在这个基础上团结他们，依靠他们，初步改选支部的领导，并初步整顿农会的组织，然后成立临时人代会，在支部领导下，依靠人代会正式进行结束土改的工作，这一段党内外的思想发动，组织调整，对整个运动过程是有决定意义的。
  二、在具体执行结束土改的工作中，必须开展两条战线的斗争，贯
        彻政策教育。
    林县许多村的经验证明，党员与群众的思想是不能一次完全打通的，常常是碰到具体问题时，便又会摇摆起来，不是左，便是右；因此为着贯彻党的正确政策，必须具体地进行两条战线的斗争。特别要在党内号召每个党员，遵守人代会的决议，并成为执行政策的模范；有错误的同志在结束土改中必须改正自己的错误。例如临时人代会成立后，第一项工作便是审查订正被斗户成份，这时与被斗户有关者，力图降低其成份，给予更多补偿；反之有些力图提高其成份，避免给其“补偿”。
    又如进行讨论“安置”、“补偿”、“调剂”的原则时，群众中有的主张无分别的补到一定水平；有的重视调剂土地给贫雇，轻视补偿中农和安置地富；有的重“安置”、“补偿”，轻视给贫雇调剂土地。再如在动员翻身户退出多分果实与安置地富时，如不适当，也易发生打击贫雇的右的倾向等等。因此，在这些方面都必须十分慎重。随时进行两条战线的斗争。
  三、开展群众检查总结，把运动推向生产建设、整党建政的方向。
    结束土改基本上告一段落时，发动群众开展一个检查总结运动，广泛征求群众对这次结束土改的意见，准备修正不妥当的地方，作为定案；并经过丈量土地，发土地证，宣布土改结束。在总结运动中，继续提高党员与群众的觉悟，使他们自觉的、有领导的转向组织起来生产建设的方向。
    首先要在党的支部内开展检查总结，聘请群众代表参加，检查支部在结束土改中的领导，总结其成绩与缺点，从而系统的进行整党。检查每个党员在土改以来及这次结束土改中执行党的政策，是否有动摇，是否有违背党的决议和纪律的行为。全面的检查每个党员的思想作风，开展批评与自我批评，倾听群众代表所提的意见，对党员中好的给予表扬，不好的给予批评，真正个别一贯不好的，及严重脱离群众的分子，适当给予纪律处分，然后在这个基础上，进行支部民主选举，产生支部新的支委会，坚持并巩固在结束土改中逐渐建立起来的支部各种制度。并系统的进行组织起来生产建设与党纲党章的教育，使所以党员在行动中有明确的方向。
    同时在检查总结运动中，还需发动群众对村干及临时人代会代表进行批评与检查，看是否能代表自己的利益。然后划定选区，登记选民，照华北临时人代会规定的选举法草案慎重的实行民主选举，成立正式的人代会和村政府。根据上级的方针与群众要求，确定本村今后应兴应革的大事，如整顿合作社，整顿差务，制定村公约等等。
