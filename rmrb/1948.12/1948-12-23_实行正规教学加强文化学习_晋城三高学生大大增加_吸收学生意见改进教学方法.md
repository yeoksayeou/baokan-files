    【Taiyue News】Since the autumn semester, Jincheng County's Number Three Elementary High School has gradually moved towards regular study. The school began implementing formal teaching, strengthening cultural learning, and reducing the excessive production labor, social activities, and political classes that were previously in the school. From the start of school on October 7th (Gregorian calendar) to today (November 6th), a full two months of improvement have yielded preliminary results. The main points are reported as follows: First, the implementation of formal teaching and the strengthening of cultural learning in teaching have led to a significant increase in the number of students. (The fact that peasants have turned over and have more conditions for their children to enter elementary high school should also be a social reason for the increase in students - Editor). The number of students has increased significantly from more than 170 before autumn to 245. In this term's enrollment of new students, strict entrance examinations were implemented. Those who did not meet the level of elementary high school or remedial classes were promptly explained to and encouraged to return to junior elementary school. At the same time, the more than 120 old students from before autumn (because more than 40 of the old students from before autumn did not come this season) were reorganized and placed in classes according to their level. In addition, 102 new students were added. There have also been new improvements in teachers' teaching and students' learning.

    　　　　Teachers are more serious about teaching
    Previously, when teaching a subject, there was mostly no plan. Teachers would simply bring the textbook to class and lecture, and in a semester, they would teach wherever they got to, even if they didn't finish. The courses in a class were not interconnected. For example, in the second year of high school (sixth grade), the Chinese language class was on the fourth volume, while the history class was still on the second volume. This term, the entire school has established a semester-long education plan and a schedule for each course, which was announced to the students at the opening ceremony this term. Before each class, teachers make full preparations to ensure planned teaching. Also, previously, the spirit of self-study tutoring was not understood well enough. Teachers were afraid to give students too many explanations, fearing they would commit the mistake of "spoon-feeding," and let students discuss among themselves too much, resulting in students not understanding. Now, they have mastered the method of elicitation and guidance. In order to make students understand, they are not afraid to give more explanations. Teachers must play a certain role in the classroom and cannot abandon tutoring. Students are allowed to preview before class, and the teachers must be responsible for answering the difficult questions raised, not just having students ask and answer each other. Also, each week, the study class leader reports on the courses taught by each teacher during the week, how students understand and what opinions they have, for the teachers to study and improve. The second manifestation of teachers taking teaching seriously is that teachers used to take leave frequently, but now they do not take leave or take less leave. At the same time, leave registration is implemented. If there is something to do, it is done on Sunday, with the principle of not delaying lessons. Also, in their spare time, teachers used to go out to the streets when they had no classes, but now they do not leave the school unless necessary. For example, teacher Su Shiyuan said: "I used to go to the streets when I had no classes, but now extracurricular assignments (diaries, small characters, large characters, etc.) take up all my time, and I simply have no time to leave the school." The third manifestation: In addition to seriously conducting classroom teaching, they are also responsible for guiding students' self-study. In the past, during self-study, students were allowed to discuss among themselves, and teachers rarely watched the class or did not watch the class at all. Even if they did, they only maintained order and did not play an active role. Now, during self-study, teachers fully supervise the class, are responsible for guiding students' self-study, and answer difficult questions. Therefore, teachers' work during self-study has become busy. For example, when Su Shiyuan first supervised self-study, he wanted to take the time to correct a few compositions in class, but because of answering and explaining students' difficult questions, he didn't correct a single one in class for several days. Another thing is that the teachers' own study has also been strengthened. Every day, everyone adheres to a two-hour study system. Each teacher subscribes to a copy of the Xinhua Daily as material for current affairs study. In addition, there are five hours of collective professional study each week (excluding Saturdays and Sundays), which are all held for one hour after students finish their evening self-study.

    　　　　Students' enthusiasm for learning has increased
    In addition to teachers taking teaching seriously, students' enthusiasm for learning has also been unprecedentedly increased due to the strengthening of cultural learning. In the past, students did not pay enough attention to cultural learning. Some would take leave for ten days or half a month, using the excuse of returning home for production (even if they didn't really go back). In the students' own minds, they all thought that the school paid attention to political education, frequent production labor, and social activities, and that cultural learning was not the main thing, and they did not take classes seriously. They felt that laboring at school was not as good as laboring at home, and many students often did not come to school. Now that cultural learning has been strengthened, students reflect: "The learning life is really intense! There is no free time at all." Students are also cautious about taking leave, fearing that they will miss lessons. For example, Shi Jiaxiang's father went to support the war effort, and there was no one at home to feed the livestock. He needed to go back for a few days. When his father came to ask him to take leave, he cried. When asked why he was crying, he said he didn't want to miss class. After explaining the situation to him, he went back. Also, the second year of high school class requested an extra half hour of self-study outside of class to learn writing. They are all actively engaged in self-study, and no one says a word idly. In addition, the students' leave time has been shortened, and they return to school on time after taking leave. In the past, students often took leave to go home to get rice and flour, and those who lived far away would have to delay for two to three days. Now, students usually do not take leave and have their family members send the rice and flour. For example, Du Jin鼎, Jin Xiangcheng, and others all had their parents personally send it. The rest of the students take leave completely on Saturday afternoons and return to school on time on Sundays. Other things, such as students' extracurricular assignments, have also been strengthened. In addition to writing large and small characters every day, they also have to write a diary every two days and irregular (written when there is material) wall newspapers. Each class also compiles a mass blackboard, first practicing writing in the school, and then writing street mass blackboard newspapers. The school has also established a temporary test system, allowing students to prepare at any time and anywhere. Since the start of school, they have already taken two tests. Due to the students' increased enthusiasm for learning, the number of failures in various subject tests and exams has been greatly reduced. For example, of the 33 students in the third year of high school class who participated in the exam, only 10 failed in major subjects such as Chinese and arithmetic (this is still the class with the weaker students). Due to the school's strengthening of cultural learning, students' parents' understanding of the school has also changed accordingly. In the past, because the school's production labor and social activities took up a lot of time, students' parents reflected: "Going to school now is not for studying, but for planting and doing work. It's better to just labor and produce at home!" Now the reflection is different. For example, the father of student Qin Huaiyi said: "Now the school can really learn culture. I will quickly send my child to school as soon as he recovers from his illness."

    　　　　Pay appropriate attention to extracurricular activities, and do not affect physical health
    After carrying out formal teaching and strengthening cultural learning, and after students' enthusiasm for learning has increased, another deviation has occurred. Everyone is spending all day studying subjects, not paying attention to physical activities, affecting physical development and health. In order to overcome this deviation, in addition to doing morning exercises every morning, extracurricular activities are also carried out in the afternoon. Every afternoon, there is one hour of collective activities, such as playing basketball, table tennis, kicking shuttlecock, and patting small rubber balls. Teachers participate in guidance, and in addition, fifteen minutes of recess exercises are held after one lesson in the morning.

　　实行正规教学加强文化学习
    晋城三高学生大大增加         
    吸收学生意见改进教学方法
    【太岳讯】晋城县三高小从秋季开学后，学校工作逐渐走向了正规学，校开始实行了正规教学，加强了文化学习，减少了以前学校过多的生产劳动、社会活动和政治课等。从十月七号（阳历）开学以来到今天（十一月六号）整整两个月的改进过程，现在已获得了初步成绩，今把主要的几点报导如下：首先在教学上实行了正规教学，加强了文化学习后，学生人数大量的增加了。（农民翻身后，更具备了使其子弟入高小读书的条件，也应当是学生增多的一个社会原因——编者）由秋前一百七十余名学生增加到二百四十五名。开学时在这期招收新生中，实行了严格的入学考试，不够高小和补习班程度的，及时的解释动员他们回去住初小。同时把秋前的一百二十余个旧生（因秋前的旧生这季有四十多个没来），按程度整顿编了班，还增加了新生一百零二名，另外在教员教学和学生学习上也有了新的改进。
    　　　　教员教学认真了
    以前教一门功课，大都没计划，临时上堂拿上课本就讲，并且在一学段里，教到哪里就算到哪里，教不完也行。一个班里功课，互不衔接。例如高二班（六年级）国语上的是四册，历史还上的是二册。这期全校已订出了一学段的教育计划和各门课程的进度，并在这期开学典礼会上给学生宣布了，在每科上课以前，教员都做了充分准备，做到有计划的教学。又如以前对自学辅导的精神领会不够，不敢给学生多讲解，怕犯了注入式的毛病，多让学生自己讨论，结果学生还是了解不了；现在掌握了启发诱导的方法，为让学生明白，不怕多讲解，课堂上还要教员起一定的作用，不能放弃辅导。在上课时让学生预习，提出的疑难问题教员必须负责做解答，不能只由学生互相问答。又在每周由学习班长汇报各教员在本周间所上的功课，学生们了解如何及有何意见，以供教员研究改进。教员认真教学的第二个表现是从前教员经常请假，现在做到了不请假和少请假。同时又执行了请假登记，有事要办都是在星期日，以不耽误功课为原则。又如在课余的时间，以前没课了好去街跑跑，现在都做到了无事不离学校了。例如教员苏士元说：以前没课好去街上，现在的课外作业（日记小楷大楷等）就把工夫占去了，简直没有时间出校门。第三个表现：除认真进行课堂教学外，还负责指导了学生的自习，在从前上自习时，是让学生自己讨论，教员很少看堂或不看堂，就是去看也不过是维持维持秩序，起不了积极作用。现在上自习时，教员完全看堂，负责指导学生们的自习，以及解答疑难问题，因此，在自习时教员的工作忙起来了。例如苏士元在起初看自习时，还想在堂上抽空改几本作文，因回答解释学生们的疑难问题，结果好几天在堂上一本也没改。再一个是教员本身的学习也加强了，每天每人都坚持了两小时的学习制度，每个教员都自订了一份新华日报，作为时事学习的材料，另外每周还有五小时的集体业务学习（时间是除星期六、日两天外），都是在晚上学生上罢夜自习后，教员集体学习一点钟。
    　　　　学生学习情绪提高了
    除了教员教学认真外，因加强文化学习，学生的学习情绪也空前提高了。以前学生对文化学习上也重视不够，有些借口回家生产（本来不回去也行），就有十天半月请假不来的。在学生自己的观念上，都以为学校是注意政治教育，经常的生产劳动和社会活动，文化学习不是主要的，都不以上课为重。觉得在学校劳动不如回家劳动好，经常有好多学生不到校。现在加强了文化学习后，同学的反映说：一天学习生活真紧张呀！一点空闲的时间也没有，学生对请假也慎重了，怕误了功课。例如史家祥，他父亲去支差，家里没人喂牲口，需要他回去几天，他父亲来叫他告假时，他就哭了，问他为什么哭，他说是不愿意误课，经过同他解释说明后，他才回去了。又如高二班在课外时间，要求增加半点钟自习，学习写作。在自习里都积极的干，一句闲话都没人说。另外是学生请假时间缩短，请假后都按时到校了。以前学生回家拿米拿面的经常请假误课，路远的就得耽误两天至三天，现在学生平时都不请假，让家里人送来米面。例如杜金鼎、靳香诚等，都由他们家长亲自送来，其余学生请假完全是在星期六下午，星期日即准时到校了。其他如学生的课外作业也增强了，每天除写大小字外，还要两天写一篇日记，不定期（有材料即写出）的壁报，各班还编了大众黑板，先在校内练习写，写好后再写街头大众黑板报。学校还建立了临时测验制度，让学生们随时随地做准备，从开学到现在已测验了两次。由于学生们学习情绪提高后，在各科测验考试中，不及格的大大减少了。如高三班参加考试的三十三人，国语算术等主要功课不及格的仅十个人（这还是程度较差的班）。由于学校加强了文化学习，学生家长们对学校的认识也随着变了。以前由于学校的生产劳动和社会活动占时间多，那时学生家长反映：“现在进学校不是念书，而是种地和干工作，不如就在家劳动生产吧！”现在的反映不同了，例如学生秦怀义的父亲说：“现在学校真正能学习文化了，我孩病好赶快送他上学去。”
    　　　　适当注意课外活动　不要影响身体健康
    进行正规教学与加强文化学习，学生学习情绪提高后，可是又发生了一种偏向，大家一天用功于学科，不注意身体活动，影响身体发育和健康。为克服这一偏向，除每天早上出早操外，还执行了下午课外活动，每天下午集体活动一点钟。如打篮球、乒乓球、踢毽子、拍小皮球等。由教员参加指导，同时在上午上一课后，还举行十五分钟的课间操。（晋城县三高通讯小组、王毅、牛子禹、赵广业、苏士元）
