Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 29th – Reports from various sources indicate that the reactionary rule of the Tito nationalist clique is becoming increasingly isolated. Despite the increasingly severe reign of terror by Rankovic's secret police, the dissatisfaction and resistance of the Yugoslav people are growing. Two hundred and thirty students at the University of Belgrade, the capital of Yugoslavia, supported the Cominform's decision on the Yugoslav issue, condemning the Tito clique's nationalist and terrorist rule. The Tito clique's suppression of these students has aroused even greater indignation among the students. Former Yugoslav Ambassador to Poland, Ljumo Vic, sternly criticized the Tito regime domestically and was arrested after refusing Tito and Djilas's demands to retract his criticism. The ministers of justice, transportation, trade, and foreign trade of the Slovenian Republic government have also been removed from their posts due to dissatisfaction with Tito. Personnel from the Yugoslav diplomatic missions in Hungary and Egypt have successively resigned. Fourteen Yugoslav students studying in Poland have refused to return home. The secretary of the Yugoslav Communist Party organization in Hungary, former Yugoslav chargé d'affaires in Budapest, Brankov, stated that the Tito clique is losing prestige and cannot control the entire party, but only a small group. Anti-Tito party members within the Yugoslav Communist Party, including several newly elected members of the Central Committee, are increasingly taking the form of organized resistance.

　　铁托集团日趋孤立
  　党内正有组织地反抗他
    【新华社陕北二十九日电】各方报导：铁托民族主义集团的反动统治，现正日趋孤立。尽管兰科维奇秘密警察的恐怖统治日益加严，但南斯拉夫人民的不满与反抗正日益扩大。南国首都贝尔格莱德大学的二百三十名学生支持情报局对南共问题的决定，谴责铁托集团所施行的民族主义与恐怖主义的统治，铁托集团对这批学生的镇压，已引起学生的更大愤慨。前任南国驻波大使利约莫维区在国内严正地批评铁托政权，并于拒绝铁托和德热拉斯迫其收回此项批评的要求后被逮捕。斯洛文尼亚共和国政府的司法、交通、贸易及对外贸易等部部长，亦因不满铁托而被撤换。南国驻匈及驻埃及外交使团人员均相继辞职。在波兰留学的南籍学生十四人拒绝返国。匈境南共党组织的书记、前任南驻布达佩斯代办布兰科夫称：铁托集团正在丧失威信，它控制不了整个党，只能控制一个少数的集团。南共党内反铁托的党员，包括几位新当选的南共中委，正愈益采取有组织地反抗的形式。
