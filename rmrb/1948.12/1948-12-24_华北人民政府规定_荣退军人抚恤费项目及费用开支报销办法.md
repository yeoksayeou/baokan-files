Items (2) and (6) shall be claimed and reimbursed monthly by the Veterans Administration Office and veteran schools. Item (10) shall be issued and reimbursed by the original agency (agencies above the county level) upon presentation of certificates. The pensions for retired veterans shall be uniformly controlled and audited by the Civil Affairs Departments (Offices, Bureaus) of each Administrative Office (City) authorized by this Government, and calculated by the Finance Department (Office, Bureau) for expenditure within the allocated grain quota. A calculation shall be reported to this Government every three months, accompanied by receipts, with detailed rosters listed by grade. The standards for issuing various expenses shall be in accordance with the "Regulations on Preferential Treatment and Pensions for Honorary Soldiers in the North China Region," "Measures for the Treatment of Old, Weak, and Sick Discharged Soldiers in the North China Region," and "Measures for the Treatment of Old, Weak, and Sick Retired Personnel in the North China Region" promulgated by this Government. Each Administrative Office (City) should immediately prepare next year's budget and submit it to this Government for review. Due to the previous inconsistencies in the financial systems of various regions, it is decided that for the second half of this year (from July 1st), the Jinan, Jiluyu, Taihang, and Taiyue regions shall only reimburse production subsidies for retired veterans to this Government, and the remaining expenses shall be resolved within the original budget. The Beiyue, Jizhong, Shijiazhuang City, and Yangquan City shall be reimbursed according to the budget. Before the new standards are announced, various regions shall continue to spend according to the old standards. Except for the production subsidies, which should be implemented immediately according to the new standards, the new standards for veteran pensions and honorary bonuses shall be calculated from January 1st of next year. It is hoped that this order will be followed accordingly. This order is hereby issued.
