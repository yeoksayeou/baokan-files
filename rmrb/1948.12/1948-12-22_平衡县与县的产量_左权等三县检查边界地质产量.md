　　Balancing Production Between Counties
    Zuoquan and Two Other Counties Inspect Border Area Geological Production
    [Taihang News] At the end of October, the Taihang Second Administrative Office instructed all counties under its jurisdiction to investigate the production of neighboring counties and to check whether the production of interspersed land (intersecting land) at the boundary between the two counties was too light or too heavy, in order to balance production between counties and lay the foundation for fixing the burden per mu of standard mu in the coming year. After receiving the order, Zuoquan immediately dispatched special personnel to conduct inspections in five villages at the border between the county and Licheng and Heshun counties. At the junction of Zuoquan and Heshun, the production of Hanwang Town in Zuoquan and Yaodi and Beipo villages in Heshun were inspected. Cadres from the three villages participated and jointly inspected the land with the same geological conditions in the two villages, and found that the production was set too light or too heavy. For example, a piece of land in Beilingyan in Hanwang Town and a piece of land in Fanshuizhu Village in Yaodi Village had the same geological conditions, but the former was set at five dou per mu, and the latter was set at three dou per mu. In addition, for two identical pieces of flat land, Hanwang Town set it at one shi and three dou per mu, and Yaodi Village set it at one shi and seven dou per mu. There was a piece of land of six mu, which was divided and planted by three households, and the yield per mu was one shi and seven dou for one household, one shi and five dou for one household, and one shi and four dou for the other household. A piece of land in Beipo Village was better than another piece of land in Yaodi Village, but the former was set at five dou and the latter was set at six or seven dou. The reason was that the former was the main village and the latter was the secondary village. The main village was suppressing the secondary village. At the border between Zuoquan and Licheng, the Yuntoudi Village in Zuoquan and the Kanhouchun Village in Licheng were inspected. These two villages are both on the north bank of the Yellow River, and the flat land along the village is all waterlogged land, with two harvests a year, and the situation is similar; however, the average yield per mu in Yuntoudi Village was set at two shi, while Kanhouchun Village only averaged one shi and eight dou. This year, Kanhouchun Village distributed 13 jin and 13 liang of millet, 4 jin and 1 liang of wheat, and 9 liang of corn for each burden; Yuntoudi Village distributed 26 jin and 12 liang per share. This imbalance has now been provided to the leadership for research and modification. (Xiu Zeng, Junqing, Junming)

　　平衡县与县的产量
    左权等三县检查边界地质产量
    【太行讯】太行二专署于十月底指示所属各县调查邻居县产量，检查两县交界处插花地（交叉地）产量有无过轻过重现象，以求县与县产量平衡，奠定下年固定标准亩负担亩的基础。左权奉令后，即抽专人到本县与黎城、和顺两县交界处五个村进行检查。在左权、和顺交界，检查了左权寒王镇与和顺窑堤、北坡三村产量。三村干部都参加，共同到两村同等地质的土地上检查，发现产量订得有轻有重。如寒王镇北岭堰一块地与窑堤村樊水珠一块地地质相同，但前者订的是每亩五斗，后者每亩三斗。另有两块相同的平地，寒王镇订的是每亩一石三，窑堤村订的是每亩一石七。有一块六亩大的地，三户分种着，每亩产量一家是一石七，一家是一石五，另一家是一石四。北坡村有一块地比窑堤村另一块地还好，但前者订五斗，后者订六、七斗。原因是前者为主村，后者为副村。主村压着副村。在左权、黎城边界，检查了左权的云头底村与黎城的看后村。这两村都在黄河北岸，村边平地都是水地，都是一年两收，情况差不多；但云头底村每亩平均订产量二石，看后村只平均一石八。看后村今年每负担分出小米十三斤十三两，麦子四斤一两，玉茭九两；云头底村每分二十六斤十二两。这种不平衡现象，现已提供领导上研究修改。（秀曾、俊卿、俊明）
