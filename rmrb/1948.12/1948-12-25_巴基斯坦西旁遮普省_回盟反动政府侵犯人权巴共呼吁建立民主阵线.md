　　West Punjab Province, Pakistan
    Reactionary Muslim League Government Violates Human Rights; Communist Party of Pakistan Calls for Establishment of Democratic Front
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, December 23rd] According to TASS, Karachi, December 18th: The Secretary of the Communist Party of Pakistan in West Punjab Province issued a statement saying that the governor's recent amendment to the Public Security Act, allowing the government to detain people for six months without trial, is a new offensive against civil rights. The statement pointed out that the Muslim League government cannot give land to farmers, jobs to workers, or housing to the homeless. The statement called for the establishment of a united democratic front to fight for the establishment of a democratic government.
    Note: Since India and Pakistan were partitioned and "independent" dominion governments were established on August 15th of last year, the Communist Party of India decided at its Second Congress held this March that the Communist Party of India only exists in India, and Pakistan would form its own independent Communist Party. The West Punjab Province Communist Party organization mentioned here should belong to the Communist Party of Pakistan.

　　巴基斯坦西旁遮普省
    回盟反动政府侵犯人权巴共呼吁建立民主阵线
    【新华社陕北二十三日电】据塔斯社喀喇蚩十八日讯：巴基斯坦西旁遮普省共产党书记发表声明称：省长最近对公安法的修正，使政府可不加审讯而监禁人民六个月，这是对公民权利的新攻势。声明指出：回教联盟政府不能给农民以土地，给工人以工作，给无家者以房屋。声明呼吁建立一个单一的民主阵线，以争取民主政府的成立。
    按：自去年八月十五日印度与巴基斯坦实行分治并分别成立“独立”的自治领政府后，印度共产党即在其今年三月举行的第二届代表大会上决定：印度共产党仅存于印度，巴基斯坦另组独立的共产党。这里所说的西旁遮普省共产党组织，当属于巴基斯坦共产党。
