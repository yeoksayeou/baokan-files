[Ji-Lu-Yu Telegram] The Ji-Lu-Yu Administrative Office and Military Region formally established the Veterans Committee in mid-November, making the following decisions regarding the current veterans' work: (1) In the future, the basic principle for resettling veterans will be decentralized placement in homes, land distribution for production, and employment. To implement this principle, all local government and civilian personnel must adequately recognize that veterans have received long-term education from the Party and have been tempered by revolutionary wars. They have shed blood for the revolutionary cause and possess a considerable level of awareness. If given good education and training, the majority can become active participants in mass movements and village construction and may also be selected and trained as various cadres. This is a significant force that cannot be ignored. The general "meritorious official mentality" can only be overcome by strengthening education. We cannot mistake the bad habits of a very small number of people with remnants of warlord thinking, newly liberated soldiers, or those with problematic backgrounds as a general phenomenon. The contempt or aloofness that some cadres and the masses hold towards veterans must be thoroughly corrected. (2) All local government agencies and management departments, such as telephone bureaus, saltpeter and sulfur bureaus, and warehouses, should absorb veterans into their work as much as possible. If veterans are physically unable to fully meet the demands of the work or the conditions for cadre positions, they can be employed according to the instructions of the North China Government, with two people working as one or three people working as two. The over-staffing costs can be covered by the veterans' retirement and welfare funds. This not only avoids reducing work efficiency due to veteran resettlement but also reduces government expenditure through veteran work. This is beneficial to policy and should be resolutely implemented. (3) Establish a Veterans Management Office to specifically handle veterans' affairs and the retirement of sick and elderly soldiers, as well as all matters requiring resolution at the Administrative Office after retirement and demobilization. The Military Region's Veterans Education Institute and the Administrative Office's Veterans School will be transferred to the unified leadership of the Veterans Management Office. In addition to accepting instructions from the North China Veterans Management Office and implementing the decisions of the local Veterans Management Committee, the Veterans Management Office will be directly led by the Administrative Office administratively.

　　冀鲁豫成立荣军委员会
  　注意培养荣军干部担任各种建设工作
    【冀鲁豫电】冀鲁豫行署、军区于上月中旬正式成立荣军委员会，对目前荣军工作作出决定：（一）今后安置荣军，基本上是分散安家、分地生产、就业的方针。为贯彻这一方针，所有地方政民人员，均须足够的认识到荣军受过长期党的教育，及革命战争的锻炼，并为革命事业流过血，具有相当觉悟程度，如果加以很好教育和培养，大多数可成为群众运动及村政建设中的积极分子，也可能选拔训练为各种干部，这是很大的一批力量，不容忽视。一般的“功臣思想”，只有加强教育加以克服，不能以极少数带有军阀残余思想的，或新解放战士或成份不好的不良作风当作一般现象。有些干部与群众对荣军卑视或抱有敬而远之的态度，必须彻底纠正。（二）各地方政府机关及经营管理部门，如电话局、硝磺局、仓库等，均应尽可能的吸收荣军参加工作；如因荣军体力不负，不完全适合工作及条件干部条件时，可依照华北政府指示，以两个人作一个人或三个人作两个人使用。其超编制报销数，可由荣军退伍抚恤粮项内开支。这样，不但不因为安置荣军而减低工作效率，且因荣军工作而减少政府开支，这是有利于政策的，应坚决执行。（三）成立荣军管理处，专门处理荣军与病老军人退伍事项，及退伍复员后所有必须到行署解决的事项。并将军区荣教院及行署荣校移交荣管处统一领导。荣管处除接受华北荣管处指示，执行本区荣管委员会决定以外，在行政上，直接受行署领导。
