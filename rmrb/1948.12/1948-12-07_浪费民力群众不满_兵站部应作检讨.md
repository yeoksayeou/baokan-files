　　Wasting Public Labor Causes Mass Dissatisfaction
    The Garrison Service Department Should Conduct a Self-Criticism
    On October 17th, Comrade × of the Garrison Service stationed in Zhengding instructed Lingshou to mobilize civilian labor to transport cotton shoes to × County, stipulating that they arrive at × Village by the 21st. After receiving the task, the county rapidly mobilized civilian labor and arrived at the designated location on time. However, due to unfinished procedures by the Garrison Service, the laborers and livestock waited for two days before commencing transport. Originally said to be over 93,000 catties, the actual amount was only around 70,000 catties, causing the laborers capable of transporting 23,000 catties to return empty-handed due to lack of tasks. On another occasion, Wang Guitang of the Garrison Service Department mobilized 256 laborers and 200 livestock in the Fourth District of Jianping to transport cotton shoes to × County, but also due to unfinished procedures, all the laborers were sent back, causing great dissatisfaction among the masses. As a department uniformly mobilizing civilian labor, the Garrison Service Department should deeply reflect on these two occurrences of wasting public labor. Other regions should also inspect and prevent similar incidents of wasting public labor from happening. (Fu Min)

　　浪费民力群众不满
    兵站部应作检讨
    十月十七日，住正定的兵站×同志，让灵寿动员民力往×县送棉鞋，并规定于二十一日赶到×庄。该县接到任务后，急速动员了民力按时到达了地点。但因兵站手续未办妥，使民工和牲口等了两天才起运。原说有九万三千多斤，结果只有七万来斤，又使能运两万三千斤的民工因无任务而空回。另一次，兵站部王贵堂到建屏四区动员民工二百五十六名，牲口二百头，往×县送棉鞋，但也因手续未办好，把所有民工都放回，引起群众非常不满。象此统一动用民力的部门，前后发生了两次浪费民力的事情，应引起兵站部深刻检讨。其他各地是否亦有浪费民力的事情产生，也应检查与防止。　（复民）
