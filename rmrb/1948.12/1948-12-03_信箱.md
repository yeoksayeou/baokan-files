　　Comrade Lin Hong:
　　Your suggestion that the government implement a unified labor tax has been studied by the North China People's Government. It is considered to have benefits in balancing and stimulating transportation, but it is not easy to implement during the current war. The government is considering implementing a work-point system for substitute cultivation.
　　Comrades Xu Qiangguo and Yuan Aimin from Shen County:
　　If what you said in your letter is true, your family should be classified as middle peasant. Your family's class status should not be designated as rich peasant or "declining middle peasant" simply because your father was corrupt or hired people for thirty-five days. The things confiscated from your family should be compensated appropriately. However, since the masses have reflected that your father had connections with the traitor Zhang Huasan and was corrupt when he worked in the public office in 1939, your father should make a deep self-criticism. If he was indeed corrupt, he should compensate the masses.
　　Comrade An Ding from Pang Village, Handan:
　　Your question has been forwarded to the Yicheng County Committee for investigation and processing.
　　Mr. Xu Chengshen from Longyao:
　　As you stated in your letter, your family participated in labor after the July 7th Incident, and only hired half a long-term worker for two years, with no other exploitation. During the land reform that will be concluded this winter in your village, you can propose to your village work team and the masses to discuss changing your class status. If your family is still being driven out and has no housing, the village should find a way to provide accommodation.

    林洪同志：
    你建议政府实行统一的劳力税，经华北人民政府研究，认为在平衡与刺激运输上确实有好处，但在目前战争时期，还不易执行。关于代耕问题实行勤工票制，政府正考虑中。深县徐强国、袁爱民同志：
    如你来信所说属实，你家应是中农成份不能因为你父亲贪污或曾雇人三十五天而将你家的成份订为富农或“下降中农”。所没收你家的东西应酌量补偿。不过群众既反映你父亲在民国二十八年办公时与汉奸张化三有联系有贪污行为，你父亲应深刻检讨，如确有贪污，应该赔偿群众。邯郸庞村安定同志：
    你的问题已转翼城县委会调查处理。隆尧徐成身君：
    如你来信所说，你家“七七”事变以后就参加了劳动，只有二年雇半个长工，别无其他剥削。在今冬你村结束土改工作中，你可以提出请你村工作组及群众讨论改变成份。你家如仍扫地出门在外，没房子住，村中应设法给予安置。
