　　Two Short Stories
  　Excerpted from the Preface to the Translated Edition of "Combined Tactics"
    In the preface to the translated edition of "Combined Tactics," Comrade Liu Bocheng cited two interesting short stories, worthy of reference for comrades studying theory. We introduce them as follows:

    I still remember that when I first entered the Advanced Infantry School in Moscow, I saw a slogan in the classroom that read: "Theory divorced from practice is dead theory; practice divorced from theory is blind practice." My understanding of theory and practice, especially in their connection, was originally very superficial. After seeing this slogan, it made me think of two stories to alert my own study.

    One is a story of dogmatism, of dead theory: In the streets of a certain city, there was a large stone that obstructed the passage of vehicles. The municipal government asked engineers to find a way to eliminate it. One engineer said, "To use explosives to break it up and transport it away would require four thousand yuan." Another engineer said, "If we use a heavy truck to transport it away, it would only require three thousand yuan." Suddenly, a very ordinary stonemason came along and said, "This only needs fifty yuan! Dig a large pit next to the large stone, push it in, and bury it flat." As a result, the municipal government implemented the stonemason's method and awarded the stonemason one hundred yuan.

    The other is a story of empiricism, of blind practice: There was a market on the bank of a certain river, and most of those coming to the market from upstream traveled by boat. Among them was a farmer who, after going to the market, bought a large pot, put it on his head, and walked home. On the way, he found it cumbersome, so he changed to a boat. When he was on the boat, he felt the boat was moving too slowly, so he went ashore to help pull the boat. It happened to be raining, and he didn't bring a hat, so he took the large pot from the boat and put it back on his head to continue pulling the boat. His friend saw him and ridiculed him, saying, "You thought it was cumbersome to wear the pot while walking, and now you're unconditionally helping to pull the boat, isn't that even more cumbersome!"

　　两个小故事
  　录自“合同战术”上部译版序言
    刘伯承同志就“合同战术”上部译版序言上，引证两个有趣的小故事，值得我们学习理论的同志参考，特介绍如下：
    我还记得，我在莫斯科初进高级步兵学校时，曾在教室里看见一幅标语，写的是：“离开实际的理论是死理论；离开理论的实际是瞎实际。”我对于理论与实际的学习，尤其是在两者的联系上，本来就肤浅得很，看了这幅标语后，使我连想到两件故事来警惕了自己的学习。
    一个是教条主义，死理论的故事：某城市中的街道上，有一块大石头，障碍了车子的来往；市政府要求工程师想法消除它。一个工程师说：“要用炸药把它炸碎运走，需用四千元。”另一个工程师说：“如用载重车把它运走，只需用三千元。”忽于此时来了一个极平常的石匠说：“这只需用五十元就行了！在大石头的旁边，挖一个大坑，把它推下埋平。”结果，市政府实行了石匠的办法，并奖给石匠一百元。
    另一个是经验主义，瞎实际的故事：某河岸有一个市集，其上游来赶集者大都乘船。其中有一个农民，赶了集买得一口大锅，戴在头上，步行回家；走在途中，嫌其赘重乃改乘船。及乘船时，他又嫌船驶上水太慢，乃登陆帮助拉船。适天落雨，他未带笠，随将其放在船中之大锅又戴在头上，继续拉船。其友人见而嘲笑之，说道：“你戴锅步行还嫌赘重，如今无条件加上为人拉船，其不越发赘重了吗！”
