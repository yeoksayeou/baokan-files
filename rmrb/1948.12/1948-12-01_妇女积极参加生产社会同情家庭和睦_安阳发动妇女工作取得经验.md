[Taixing Telegram] Participating in production, harmonizing families, gaining social sympathy, and improving women's status are the basic experiences gained from Anyang's mobilization of women. Laboring women in Anyang have traditionally participated in agricultural labor and textile production. After years of promotion and organization by us, this has become even more widespread than before. However, the situation of being beaten and mistreated has not fundamentally changed. In the past, the mobilization of women achieved considerable success, but also produced some formalistic tendencies: excessive emphasis on independence and autonomy, with some women divorcing after becoming cadres, becoming detached from their family interests. Organizing women's militias, forcing haircuts, ... losing social sympathy. Some women's work cadres consequently felt depressed, even believing that women were backward and could not be mobilized, even doubting the policy of mobilizing women in production.

Women in Anyang were originally very active in participating in production, but their painful status did not change because they were not conscious of it, always thinking that they were living off men. Men also thought that women were useless. This limited women's initiative and enthusiasm in production. Anyang's solution to this problem was to first mobilize women to continue to vigorously participate in production, and to reckon accounts among women to see what role they actually played. Many women suddenly realized: "In the past, we always thought we were living off men, but now we know that men cannot do without women." After reckoning accounts, women in Xia Zhuang greatly improved their consciousness of production, going to the fields to work during the day and spinning cotton until midnight. This year, the delivery of public grain and autumn plowing coincided, and there were few draft animals, so women plowed a lot of land with the help of animals, forming a trend of labor being glorious. Gradually changing men's perceptions of women. This kind of conscious education for production must be carried out continuously by summarizing women's labor achievements at any time and seizing the season and opportunity. When reckoning accounts, the time and energy women spend on household sideline occupations and daily life should also be included, otherwise it may lead to absolute egalitarianism that requires women and men to be equal in production labor, and at the same time it will dampen the emotions of women with many children and many household chores.

In solving women's special family abuse and marriage problems, Anyang's approach is to promote positive and correct factors among the masses, organize mass opinion, and win social sympathy. In the past, compulsory orders were often adopted from top to bottom, detaining men and mothers-in-law, resulting in more disharmony in the family and more severe oppression for women. A young woman in Beileikou who was upright and hardworking was often beaten and scolded because her husband was instigated by her mother-in-law and sisters-in-law. The masses had great sympathy for her. The work team promoted the righteousness among the masses, publicized that such troubles were not good for the family and hindered production, organized the public opinion of the whole village, criticized the mother-in-law and sisters-in-law, and persuaded her husband, and the family relationship slowly improved. The most fundamental thing in marriage problems is freedom of marriage. This is a social problem and can never be expected to be completely solved at once. It is best to use examples in this village of daughters suffering after going to their husbands' homes due to arranged marriages, and getting angry with their parents, and examples of happy lives resulting from independent marriages, to conduct comparative education among parents and gradually change the social atmosphere. A girl in Dongshui Village used to be unhappy with the family she was engaged to, and was always frowning and angry with her parents, and her parents were also very distressed. Later, the parents' thinking and social opinion were slowly educated and transformed, and the marriage was dissolved. This woman was overjoyed, and the gloomy atmosphere of the whole family was swept away.

The branch can play a decisive role in improving women's work. If the branch does not actively work on women's work and only relies on the staff, it will not be successful. In order to change the branch's view on women's work, Anyang adopted two methods: (1) Calculate the big accounts to make them aware of the importance of women from the completion of various tasks in the village. (2) Combine the actual situation in the village to check the women's work policies, guidelines, and policies and their own views. Thus, recognize the correct policies and correct your attitude. The comrades in the branch improved their attitude towards their wives and daughters, mobilized them to produce, participate in various tasks, and had a great influence on the masses.

When cultivating women cadres, Anyang paid attention to cultivating activists among the laboring and upright women to become the backbone of women's work. Individual mobilization and cultivation are not easy to achieve good results. In the current rural areas, women's individual activities are subject to greater resistance in terms of public opinion and family. When several people act together, their confidence increases, and they help each other, which is easier to reduce or break the resistance they face.

Editor's Note: When solving women's problems, it is necessary to pay attention to family harmony and social sympathy. However, beating daughters-in-law and husbands abusing wives should be stopped in accordance with the law, and even given certain punishments when necessary. Marriage disputes can be resolved through mediation, but the principles of freedom of marriage and equality of personality should be adhered to.

### 妇女积极参加生产社会同情家庭和睦　安阳发动妇女工作取得经验

　　妇女积极参加生产社会同情家庭和睦
  　安阳发动妇女工作取得经验
    【太行电】参加生产、和睦家庭、争取社会同情、提高妇女地位，这是安阳发动妇女所获得的几点基本经验。安阳劳动妇女，素有参加农业劳动及纺织的习惯。经过我们历年的提倡组织，比以前更普遍了。但挨打受气的情况并无根本改变。过去发动妇女有相当的成绩，也产生了一些形式主义的偏向：过分的强调独立自主，有些妇女当了干部就离婚，和其家庭利益脱节。组织妇女民兵，强迫剪发，……失掉社会的同情。有些妇女工作干部因而表现苦闷，竟认为妇女落后，发动不起来，甚至对在生产中发动妇女的方针也发生了怀疑。
    安阳妇女参加生产原很积极，其痛苦地位所以没有改变，在她们自己来说是不自觉的，总认为自己是靠男人活。男人也认为妇女不顶事。这就限制了妇女在生产上的积极性与主动性。安阳解决这个问题，首先发动妇女继续大力参加生产，并在妇女当中算帐，看究竟起了些什么作用。许多妇女恍然大悟：“以前总以为咱是靠男人活，现在才知道男人离不了妇女。”下庄妇女经过算帐，生产的自觉性大大提高，白天去地里劳动，夜里还纺半夜棉花。今年送公粮和秋耕挤在一起，畜力又少，妇女拉耧种的地很多，形成劳动光荣的风气。逐渐改变了男人对妇女的观感。对于这种生产自觉教育，必须随时总结妇女劳动成绩，抓紧季节及时机不断进行。算帐时，应该把妇女在家庭副业和日常生活上所用的时间和精力也计算进去，否则可能形成在生产劳动上，对妇女和男人一样要求的绝对平均主义，同时会打击孩子多、家事多的妇女的情绪。
    在解决妇女特殊的家庭虐待和婚姻问题上，安阳的做法是发扬群众中积极正确的因素，组织群众舆论，争取社会同情。过去常常采取自上而下的强迫命令方法，扣男人，扣婆婆，结果弄得家庭更不和睦，妇女受到更厉害的压迫。北磊口一个正派劳动的青年妇女，因男人受婆婆小姑挑拨，经常被打骂，群众对她很同情。工作员发扬了群众中的正气，宣传这么闹下去对家庭不好，对生产有妨碍，把全村舆论都组织起来，批评婆婆小姑，劝说她的丈夫，家庭关系慢慢好起来了。婚姻问题最根本的是婚姻自由，这是一个社会问题，绝不能期望一下求得彻底解决，最好以本村过去因包办婚姻致闺女到婆家后受痛苦、回家和爹娘生气的例子，和婚姻自主结果生活美满的例子，在父母中进行对比教育，逐渐转变社会风气。东水村一个少女，过去找的婆家不如意，成天愁眉苦脸，和爹娘生气，爹娘也很苦恼。后来慢慢教育转变了爹娘思想和社会的舆论，解除了婚姻，这个妇女欢天喜地，全家的阴霾空气也一扫而光。
    改进妇女工作支部能起决定作用。支部如对妇女工作不积极去作，只靠工作员是搞不起来的。转变支部对妇女工作的观点，安阳采用了两种方法：（一）算大帐，从村里各种工作完成的程度上使其认识妇女的重要。（二）结合本村情况，检查妇女工作方针、路线、政策和自己的观点。从而认识正确的方针，端正自己的态度。支部同志们改善了对自己妻女的态度，发动她们生产，参加各种工作，对群众的影响极大。
    安阳在培养妇女干部时，注意了培养劳动、正派妇女中的积极分子，使成为妇女工作的骨干，单个的发动培养，不易收到良好效果。在目前的农村中，妇女单个活动，在舆论、家庭方面所受阻力较大，若干人一齐行动起来，信心增加，互相帮助，较易减轻或打破所受的阻力。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    编者按：在解决妇女问题时，注意家庭和睦、社会同情，是需要的。但对婆婆打媳妇，丈夫虐待妻子，则应依法予以制止，必要时甚至予以一定处分。解决婚姻纠纷可采调解方式，但应坚持婚姻自由与人格平等的原则。
