　　Dared to Murder Captured PLA Comrades
  　War Criminal Huang Dakeng Apprehended and Brought to Justice
    Our Highest Military Tribunal in Huaihai Decides to Punish Him According to Law
    [Xinhua News Agency, Huaihai Front, 14th] War criminal Huang Dakeng, who murdered captured People's Liberation Army soldiers, has been apprehended and brought to justice. The criminal Huang was the regimental commander of the 477th Regiment of the 159th Division of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit 64th Army. Before being annihilated in the Nianzhuang area last month, he ordered his subordinates to shoot and kill twenty-one captured and wounded personnel of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, violating Article 1, Section 3 of the "Order for Punishing War Criminals" issued by the Headquarters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. The war criminal and others have now been identified from among the prisoners of Huang Botao's bandit troops. The highest military tribunal of the People's Liberation Army on the Huaihai Front has decided to punish the criminals according to the law. According to the report of two comrades of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army who were shot but not killed by Huang and others, the incident was as follows: On November 4th, during the battle of Xiaowangzhuang, east of Nianzhuangwei, twenty-three comrades of our regiment (only some were wounded) lost contact with the main force and were unfortunately captured by the 477th Regiment of the 159th Division of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit 64th Army, and were detained in the special service platoon of the regiment. On the evening of the 14th, when the Chiang bandits withdrew from Xiaowangzhuang, the regimental commander Huang Dakeng ordered Huang Guangcai, the battalion commander of his 3rd Battalion, to be responsible for shooting and killing our twenty-three comrades on the spot. Huang Guangcai then ordered his deputy battalion commander, Lü Shuming, to lead a squad from the 7th Company to shoot with machine guns, and Lü supervised the execution. Because the enemy was fleeing in a panic at the time, these two comrades lay down in the ditch and were fortunate enough to survive.

　　竟敢杀害解放军被俘同志
  　战犯黄大铿已缉拿归案
    淮海我最高军法机关决依法惩办
    【新华社淮海前线十四日电】杀害解放军俘虏之战犯黄大铿等，已缉拿归案。黄犯系蒋匪六十四军一五九师四七七团团长，上月在碾庄地区被歼前，曾命令其部属枪杀解放军某部二十一个被俘的人员与伤员，违犯了中国人民解放军总部所发布之“惩处战争罪犯命令”第一项第三条的规定。现该战犯等已自黄伯韬匪部的俘虏群中查获。淮海前线解放军最高军法机关决对该犯等依法惩办。据解放军某部被黄犯等枪杀未死之二同志报告此暴行经过称：十一月四日，碾庄圩东小王庄战斗中，我某团有二十三个同志（只有部分伤员）与部队失掉联络，不幸被蒋匪六十四军一五九师四七七团所俘，被羁于该团特务班。十四日黄昏蒋匪撤出小王庄时，该团团长黄大铿即命其三营营长黄广才负责就地枪杀我二十三个同志。黄广才又令其副营长吕树明率七连一个班以机枪射杀，吕并监督执行。因当时敌人狼狈逃窜，此二人伏至沟内幸未致命，得以生还。
