(Taiyue Telegram) The Yangcheng township postal construction experiment was successful, achieving both speed and savings in civilian labor. Previously, Yangcheng's rural postal delivery work relied on each district hiring postal workers for delivery. The entire county, with its six districts, employed a total of thirty postal workers, who could only reach the administrative villages. The delivery of newspapers and letters to the larger natural villages depended on people passing by or dispatching errands. According to statistics from the Second and Fourth Districts, the use of civilian labor amounted to 6,660 workdays per year. Furthermore, the thirty postal workers required 302.4 *shi* of millet annually. Postal workers at the district offices also served as communication clerks and performed administrative tasks, sometimes delaying the delivery of newspapers and letters. For example, in the Shijialing administrative village of the Third District, only ten *li* from the city, the newspaper from July 15th had not been seen by July 21st. In the end, it was delivered by someone passing by. Without someone passing by, people would have to wait ten days to half a month, and sometimes items would even be lost. Some natural villages sent primary school students or semi-able-bodied women to pick up newspapers, which often resulted in people going without the newspapers arriving, or the newspapers arriving without anyone going, resulting in a great waste of civilian labor. On June 4th of this year, the county government held a district chief meeting to review the previous rural postal work and decided on improvement measures, with the principles of speed and savings. On June 6th, experiments began in the Second District, and subsequently expanded to the First and Fourth Districts, becoming widespread throughout the county in July and August. The method involved determining postal workers at the district office based on land ownership, using a system of calculating points per *li* and then converting points into work. The work was counted as *chai gong* (corvée labor). Each district had sixteen postal workers, with each postal worker averaging only seven or eight days per month. The entire district was divided into four postal routes, with four postal workers per route. Each person walked one day, using only seven days of work per month. This not only avoided affecting their own production but also saved the previous expenditure of eight *dou* of millet per postal worker. This postal work was borne by the entire district. In addition, the entire district was divided into several postal routes, connecting administrative villages or natural villages with newspaper subscribers as much as possible. For areas that were particularly circuitous or time-consuming, a separate station was established. Postal workers would leave newspapers and letters for villages not connected to the postal routes at this station, and the villages would send people to pick them up. Postal workers also carried a certain amount of postage stamps to facilitate the mailing of letters from various villages, registering them upon return. The Second District divided into four routes, with sixteen postal workers serving 222 newspaper subscribing villages, ensuring that newspapers and letters were delivered to subscribers and recipients on the same day they arrived in the district. Each district also made postal bags about six or seven inches long and three or four inches wide, with the subscriber's name written on the outside, to prevent loss and delivery errors. In August, the system was changed to every other day, based on the days newspapers arrived. This saved over 300 *shi* of millet. The entire county had twenty-four routes, connecting a total of 478 villages. The round trip distance to the district was 2,046 *li*, with one workday per sixty *li*, equivalent to 331 one-*fen* workdays. Based on the every-other-day system, seventeen workers were needed each time, totaling 2,141 workdays per year, saving a great deal of labor. The speed was increased, and there were no more instances of loss. According to a recent inspection, some problems have arisen: the current every-other-day system is fast from top to bottom, but slow from bottom to top. Secondly, postal workers fear the burden is heavy and urgent documents cannot be delivered. After discussion, further improvements were made: rural postal delivery work is now led by the deputy secretary of the sub-district committee, and postal workers are paid a wage, with 60 *li* as the standard per workday, and 1.5 *liang* of millet per *li*, amounting to 5.125 *jin* of millet per workday. Based on a bi-weekly system, each person receives 84.5 *jin* of millet per month, equivalent to 7.2 *dou*. The entire county employs seventeen people, totaling 8.884 *shi*, or 106.08 *shi* per year, saving more than half compared to the past. Postal workers are semi-detached from production. In villages where the district office is located, a fixed person is responsible and is uniformly used by the postal service. In places without a postal service, one person from the cooperative takes on the role or a dedicated person is set up, both receiving appropriate remuneration, with a standard of no more than 4 *dou* of millet. This includes the commissions from selling stamps and subscriptions each month. Those with higher income from commissions receive less subsidy, and those with lower income receive more subsidy. To address the issue of slow delivery from bottom to top, postal workers up and down the lines are required to meet at designated locations to exchange documents before continuing. In case of urgent documents, an additional person can be hired, also paid according to the *li*-based wage system. Other minority natural villages not connected to the postal routes continue to organize the masses to pick up and deliver themselves.

　　阳城乡邮建设成功
    【太岳电】阳城乡邮建设试验成功，又快又节省民力。阳城原有乡村邮递工作，均采用各区雇用邮工传递。全县六个区共雇有邮工卅人，只能到各行政村，较大之自然村的报纸书信的传递，均利用使人捎带或派差去送。据二、四区统计，一年内使用民力就有六千六百六十个。而三十个邮工每年又需小米三百零二石四斗。邮工在区公所还当通信员、做事务、有时反耽误了报纸信件的传递。如三区的史家岭行政村离城才十里，七月十五日的报纸，二十一日还未看到，最后还是便人捎去的，没便人就等十天半月，甚至还会遗失。有些自然村派小学生或妇女半劳力取报，也经常是人去了，报没来，报来了，人没去，浪费民力大。今年六月四日，县府开区长会议时，检讨了去过的乡邮工作，决定了改进办法。以送快与节省为原则。六月六日先到二区开始实验，随后推行到一、四区，七、八月间就普及全县。其办法是：在区公所按土地确定邮工，采用按里计分，按分计工办法。所用工算作差工。每区十六个邮工，每个邮工每月才平均七、八天。全区分建四条邮线，一条邮线四个邮工。一人走一天，一月内也是用七天工。既不误自己的生产，也省下了过去每个邮工八斗米的开支。此项邮工由全区负担。另外把全区分成几条邮线，尽量把有报纸订户的行政村或自然村联结起来。十分绕道、耽误时间者，另设一个站。邮工到此站上，将未通邮线村庄之报纸信件放下，由该村庄派人来取。邮工还带上一定数量的邮票，以便利各村有邮寄信件时应用，回来登记。二区分了四条路线，十六个邮工，二百二十二个订报村庄，报纸信件到区后，当天就能传递到订报和收信人手中。各区并做有六七寸长三四寸宽的邮袋，外边写着订户的姓名，把报纸和信件装在里边，防止遗失与传递错误。八月份又改为隔日制。按报纸送到的日子出发。这样节省了三百多石小米。全县有二十四条路线，共贯串村庄四百七十八个。往区里程二千零四十六里，六十里一个工，顶三百三十一个一分工。如以隔日制算，每次需工十七个，全年共用人工二千一百四十一个，省工很多。速度加快了，更没有遗失的现象。据最近检查，又发生了一些问题：现在的隔日制，上往下快，下往上慢。其次，邮工恐感负担重，紧急文件无法传递。经讨论后，又加以改进：乡村邮递工作由分委秘书负责领导，邮工采用工资制度，每工以六十里为标准，按里计米，每里小米一两半，每工合米五斤十两。以双日计算，每人每月小米八十四斤半，合七斗二升。全县用十七人，合八石八斗四升，全年一百零六石八升，比过去还节省一倍多。邮工是半脱离生产的。在区公所所在村，固定人担负，由邮务所统一使用。没有邮务所的地方，由合作社一人兼办或另设专人，均给予适当报酬，以不超过四斗米为标准。其每月出售邮票订报等所提成数亦在内。收入成数多者，津贴少些，少者多津贴。上慢下快的问题，上下邮工规定会合地点，必须见面后互换文件，然后再走。遇有紧急文件，可以多雇一人，也以按里计工的办法给工资。其他少数不通邮线之自然村，仍组织群众自己取送。
