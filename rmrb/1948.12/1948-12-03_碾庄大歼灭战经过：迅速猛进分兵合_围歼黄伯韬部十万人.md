Xinhua News Agency, Huaihai Front, 30th. A front-line reporter described the annihilation of the enemy Huang Botao's army: After the start of the Huaihai Campaign, our East China Field Army units swept across the enemy's positions in the 300-li wide area north of the Longhai Railway with a rapid and fierce momentum, advancing from north to south, intercepting and encircling Huang Botao's army, which was fleeing from the east bank of the Grand Canal towards Xuzhou. On the eastern route, our army first captured Tancheng in southern Shandong on the 8th, completely annihilating the bandit Wang Hongjiu's troops, a pseudo-Shandong security brigade, with more than 5,000 men. Central Route: Our army, advancing south along the Jinpu Railway, after winning the uprising of two armies from the enemy's Third Pacification Zone on the 8th, passed through the defense area of this unit through Lin, Zao, Yi, and Tai, and went straight to the east side of Xuzhou. When our main forces were approaching the Longhai Railway, the enemy's Ninth Pacification Zone Command stationed in Xinpu (Haizhou) abandoned the city and fled west with the 44th Army on the 6th. Huang Botao's army, which was originally stationed in the Xu(zhou) Hai(zhou) section of the Longhai Railway, attempted to prevent us from advancing south. Up to this point, Huang Botao's four armies and Li Mi's two armies did not dare to fight. They converged with the 44th Army and fled west in panic from the Xin'anzhen and Caobaji areas. Our armies followed closely, scattering the fleeing enemy, and in three days, nearly 20,000 fleeing enemies were pursued and annihilated. On the 9th, Huang Botao personally led the 25th Army, the 44th Army, the 64th Army, and the 100th Army to escape across the west bank of the Grand Canal. Before they could recover from their shock, they were blocked head-on by our army that had rapidly advanced south from the Taizao area and our army that had inserted northwest from Suqian, cutting off their connection with Xuzhou. Our pursuing troops also quickly crossed the Grand Canal at this time. Huang Botao had nowhere to go, turned back to the Nianzhuang to Caobaji area, and was surrounded by us. The 63rd Army, which was fleeing west from the Xin'anzhen area and was responsible for guarding the flanks, arrived at Yaowan on the evening of the 9th. Before it could cross the Grand Canal, it was immediately surrounded. The encirclement and annihilation battle officially began on the 11th. We first annihilated the entire 44th Division of the 100th Army and one regiment of the 3rd Division of Li Mi's army in Caobaji and Dayuanzhuang. Then, we completely resolved the isolated and besieged 63rd Army in Yaowan, capturing more than 10,000 enemy troops. After the 12th, we gradually tightened the encirclement in the Nianzhuang area, compressing the enemy into a narrow area less than ten li from east to west and less than six li from north to south. After completing the encirclement, our army launched attacks on the surrounded enemy from all directions. The enemy relied on bunker fortifications and resisted stubbornly village by village. In the battle, the enemy used poison gas against us several times, but ultimately failed to save its fate of being annihilated. On the evening of the 12th, our army captured the outer villages of Nianzhuang, including Qianbanqiao, Lao Chuzhuang, Wangjiaji, and Huoshaofangzi, annihilating most of the 44th Army, most of the 63rd Division of the 100th Army, and parts of the 25th and 64th Armies. On the evening of the 14th, we captured Pengzhuang, six li west of Nianzhuang. The defending enemy, the headquarters of the 100th Army, the headquarters of the 63rd Division, and its two regiments fled to Nianzhuang. On the morning of the 15th, they were captured by us in Huangtan, three li west of Nianzhuang. Most of them were annihilated, and the deputy commander of the army, Yang Shiyun, and the chief of staff, Cui Guangsen, were captured alive. On the 18th, we continued to capture Huangtan, completely annihilating the headquarters of the enemy's 44th Army, the headquarters of the 162nd Division, the 150th Division, and the remnants of four regiments, totaling more than 5,000 people. The army commander, Wang Zejun, was captured, and the commander of the 150th Division, Zhao Biguang, led more than 2,000 remnants to surrender automatically. On the evening of the 19th, our army launched an attack on Nianzhuang, where the enemy's army headquarters was located, and captured it all by the morning of the 20th. The enemy's army headquarters and the 25th Army headquarters were completely annihilated. The battle lasted until dusk on the 22nd. The last remnants of the 64th Army and the 25th Army, which were trapped in Dayuanshang, Sanlizhuang, Shadun, Youjiahuzhen and other villages east of Nianzhuang, were also completely wiped out. The commander of the 64th Army, Liu Zhenxiang, was captured alive. At this point, the four armies of Huang Botao's army and the 44th Army under its command, totaling ten divisions, or nearly 100,000 people, were completely destroyed, and the People's Liberation Army won the first stage of the Huaihai Campaign. When our army was encircling and annihilating Huang Botao's army in the Nianzhuang area, the bandit leader Chiang Kai-shek hurriedly transferred his so-called ace army, Qiu Qingquan's army, entirely east from west of Xuzhou, plus Li Mi's army, totaling twelve divisions, to reinforce from the north and south sides of the Longhai Railway along Xuzhou. Qiu and Li led with their five main divisions, launching a fierce attack on us under the cover of planes, tanks, and heavy artillery. Our strong blocking force bravely resisted the invading enemy in the areas north and south of the Longhai Railway west of Daxujia. After ten days and nights of fierce fighting, we killed, wounded, and captured more than 10,000 enemy troops, and destroyed more than 30 tanks. The enemy's average daily progress was less than two li. Until the 22nd, they were still blocked at the Xuejiahuzhen, Gushan, Langshan, Lintongshan, Pantang, and Liujizhen line west of Daxu-Danjizhen, watching the entire Huang army being annihilated and unable to do anything about it.

Huang Botao's Army Introduction

The Kuomintang army Huang Botao's army, which was completely annihilated in the Nianzhuang area east of Xuzhou on the 22nd of this month, had a total of four armies and eight divisions. Together with the 44th Army, which fled west from the Xinhai area and returned to Huang's command after the Huaihai Campaign, there were a total of five armies and ten divisions. Among them, the 25th Army was composed of the 40th Division, originally from Liang Guanying's old Northwest Army, the 108th Division, originally from Wang Yizhe's Northeast Army, and the 148th Division, originally from Tang Shizun's Sichuan Army. Except for the 148th Division, which was annihilated in Suxian, the rest were all annihilated in the Nianzhuang area. After the Japanese surrender, the army was transferred to northern Jiangsu to attack the liberated areas. In July of this year, it suffered heavy losses in the Yudu campaign.

44th Army: It was the old unit of Wang Zanxu's Sichuan Army. In 1942, Wang's son, Wang Zejun, was appointed army commander. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, it continuously attacked our New Fourth Army Li Xiannian's unit in the Dabie Mountains. After the Japanese surrender, it was transferred to central Jiangsu, and later transferred to the Xinhai area for defense. This time it was completely annihilated, and Wang Zejun was also captured alive.

63rd Army, 64th Army: Both were old units of Chen Jitang's Guangdong Army. Zhang Ruigui and Li Hanhun once served as commanders of these two armies. After the Japanese surrender, they both participated in the attack on our Dongjiang Column. In early 1947, they were transferred to the Shandong battlefield to attack the liberated areas. The 64th Army suffered heavy losses in Changyi South, Jiaodong in October of the same year. Except for the division headquarters, its 159th Division was completely annihilated, and one regiment of the 156th Division was also annihilated. The 153rd Division of the 63rd Army was completely annihilated in the Dingtao area of southwestern Shandong in July of the same year.

100th Army: It was a direct line of Chiang Kai-shek's troops. In 1946, it was reorganized into the 83rd Division. The division commander was Li Tianxia, who was dismissed by Chiang for poor performance in the Menglianggu battle in Shandong. Now, the original deputy division commander, Zhou Zhidao, has succeeded as army commander. The bandit Zhou was injured in this battle and fled. His deputy commander, Yang Shiyun, and chief of staff, Cui Guangsen, were captured alive. This army has been repeatedly attacked by us in the battlefields of central Jiangsu, northern Jiangsu, southern Shandong, central Shandong, southwestern Shandong, and Yuwansu. Although it has been continuously replenished, its combat effectiveness has been weakened, and this time it was finally completely annihilated.

　　碾庄大歼灭战经过：
    迅速猛进分兵合围  歼黄伯韬部十万人
    【新华社淮海前线三十日电】前线记者报导敌黄伯韬兵团覆没的经过称：淮海战役开始后，我华东野战军各部即以疾风暴雨之势，横扫陇海路北侧三百里宽广地区的敌军阵地，由北向南猛进，截击并包围由运河东岸逃向徐州的黄伯韬兵团。东路我军首于八日攻克山东南部之郯城，全歼伪山东保安旅王洪九匪部五千余人。中路：沿津浦线南下之我军于八日争取敌三绥区两个军起义后，即由临、枣、峄、台穿过该部防地，直插徐州东侧。当我大军全线进逼陇海路时，驻新（浦）海（州）之敌第九绥区司令部率四十四军于六日弃城西逃。原驻陇海路徐（州）海（州）段妄图阻我南下之黄伯韬兵团四个军及李弥兵团两个军，至此亦不敢应战，汇合四十四军，分由新安镇及曹八集地区狼狈西逃。我各路大军跟踪急追，将慌逃之敌打得稀乱，三天中间即追歼各部逃敌近两万人。九日，黄伯韬亲率之二十五军，四十四军，六十四军，一百军逃过运河西岸，惊魂甫定，却不料被由台枣地区迅速南下以及由宿迁向西北插上的我军迎头堵击，将其与徐州的联络截断。我追击部队此时亦迅速渡过运河。黄伯韬走头无路，折回碾庄至曹八集地区，被我团团包围。其由新安镇地区西逃担任侧冀警戒的六十三军，九日晚到达窑湾，来不及渡过运河，亦即陷入重围。十一日围歼战正式开始，我首在曹八集及大院庄歼其一百军之四十四师全部，及李弥部第九军第三师一个团。接着又将被孤立包围于窑湾之六十三军全部解决，俘敌万余人。十二日以后，我逐渐紧缩碾庄地区之包围圈，将敌压缩于东西不及十里，南北不及六里之狭长地带。我军于完成合围后，便从四面八方向被围之敌发起攻击。敌则踞守地堡工事，逐村顽抗。在战斗中敌曾数次向我施放毒气，但终未能挽救其被歼的命运。十二日晚我军即攻占碾庄外围前板桥，老初庄，王家集，火烧房子等村，歼灭四十四军大部，一百军六十三师大部，二十五军及六十四军各一部。十四日晚攻入碾庄西六里的彭庄，守敌一百军军部，六十三师师部及其两个团向碾庄逃窜，十五日晨在碾庄西三里的黄滩被我捕捉，大部就歼，该军副军长杨诗云及参谋长崔广森均被生俘。十八日续克黄滩，全歼敌四十四军军部，一六二师师部，一五○师及四个团的残部共五千余人，军长王泽浚被俘，一五○师师长赵璧光率残部二千余人自动投降。十九日晚我军对敌兵团部所在地的碾庄发起攻击，至二十日晨全部攻占，敌兵团部及二十五军军部被全部歼灭。战斗至二十二日黄昏，最后困守碾庄以东的大院上、三里庄、沙墩、尤家湖等村的残敌六十四军、二十五军各一部亦全被扑灭，六十四军军长刘镇湘被生俘。至此，黄伯韬兵团的四个军及其指挥下的四十四军共十个师，约近十万人，即全部覆没，人民解放军赢得了淮海战役第一阶段的胜利。当我军在碾庄地区围歼黄伯韬兵团时，匪首蒋介石曾慌忙由徐州以西将其所谓王牌军邱清泉兵团全部东调，加上李弥兵团共十二个师，由徐州沿陇海路南北两侧地区向东增援。邱、李以其五个主力师为前导，在飞机坦克重炮掩护下向我猛烈进犯。我强大阻援部队在大许家以西陇海路南北两侧地区英勇抗击来犯之敌，经十昼夜激战，共毙伤俘敌万余人，击毁坦克三十余辆，敌平均每日进展不及两里。迄二十二日犹被阻止于大许单集以西之薛家湖、鼓山、狼山、林佟山、潘塘、柳集一线，眼看着黄兵团的全部被歼而无可如何。
    黄伯韬兵团介绍
    本月二十二日在徐州以东碾庄地区全部被歼的国民党军黄伯韬兵团共辖四个军八个师，连同淮海战役后由新海地区西逃归黄指挥之四十四军在内，共为五个军十个师。其中二十五军系原属西北军梁冠英旧部之四十师，原属东北军王以哲部之一零八师及原属川军唐式遵部之一四八师所组成。其中除一四八师系在宿县被歼外，余均在碾庄地区被歼。日寇投降后该军调至苏北进攻解放区，本年七月曾在豫东战役中受重创。
    四十四军：为川军王瓒绪旧部，一九四二年由王之子王泽浚任军长。抗日战争中不断在大洪山区进攻我新四军李先念部。日寇投降后调至苏中，后调新海地区守备。此次全歼，王泽浚亦被生俘。
    六十三军、六十四军：均为粤军陈济棠旧部。张瑞贵、李汉魂曾任该两军军长。日寇投降后均曾参加进攻我东江纵队。一九四七年初先后调至山东战场进攻解放区。六十四军于同年十月间在胶东昌邑南受重大损失，其一五九师，除师部外被全部歼灭，一五六师亦被歼一团。六十三军，于同年七月其一五三师在鲁西南定陶地区被全部歼灭。
    一百军：为蒋贼嫡系部队，一九四六年整编为八十三师，师长为李天霞，因在山东孟良崮作战不力被蒋撤职，现由原副师长周志道继任军长。周匪在此次战役中受伤后潜逃。其副军长杨诗云，参谋长崔广森被生俘。该军在苏中、苏北、鲁南、鲁中、鲁西南、豫皖苏各战场屡次遭我打击，虽不断补充，但战斗力已削弱，此次终遭全歼。
