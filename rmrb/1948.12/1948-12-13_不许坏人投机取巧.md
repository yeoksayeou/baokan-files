Protecting industry and commerce is a good government policy, but some speculators are trying to sabotage it by cutting corners and adulterating products, engaging in speculation and trickery. When speculation leads to losses and trickery is reported, the masses will oppose it, and the government will not tolerate it.

In Handan City, Jinnan, the manager of the Yifeng Thread Factory, Wang Yaoxian, acted outrageously. He borrowed money from the bank and went to Shijiazhuang to speculate and engage in reselling, only to lose everything.

In Handan's new market, a cotton-fluffing workshop, tasked with fluffing cotton for the public, tried to cheat, adding sand and soil to the cotton to increase its weight. Two other flower shops also had bad ideas, hiding rotten safflowers among the good ones.

When the government discovered this and the masses reacted, the flower shops held a meeting to criticize the bad flower workshop, forbidding further trickery and demanding full compensation for the losses.

The liberated areas are not the Kuomintang-controlled areas. Deception and speculation are not allowed. It is even more shameful and wicked to harm the public to benefit oneself. As long as industry and commerce are conducted honestly, there will definitely be benefits. Legitimate business operations are protected, while speculation and trickery are against the law. Everyone must supervise and prevent bad elements from speculating again!

    不许坏人投机取巧
    保护工商业，政府政策好，有些投机商，却来把蛋捣，偷工又掺假，投机又取巧，投机赔了本，取巧被人告，群众齐反对，政府也不管。冀南邯郸市，怡丰线工厂，经理王耀先，作事真荒唐，贷了银行款，跑到石家庄，投机又倒把，结果赔个光。邯郸新市场，一家弹花坊，给公家弹花，却想要花枪，交花掺沙土，拿这顶分量。另有两花店，主意也不强，弄些烂红花，好花里边藏。政府发觉了，群众有反映，花店开大会，批评坏花坊，不许再取巧，损失全赔偿。解放区不是蒋管区，不许拐骗和投机；坑公家来肥自己，更是无耻坏习气。工商只要正经干，一定就会有利益，合法营业定保护，投机取巧犯法律，大家都要监督着，不许坏人再投机！
