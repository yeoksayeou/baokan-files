Jinnan Electric: With the support of the government, the Jinnan nitrate industry is flourishing. Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, only a few people in counties such as Ningnan, Pingxiang, and Daming engaged in this business because leaching nitrates was considered "illegal" at the time. After the war, this rule was abolished, but development remained uncommon due to limited sales channels. To greatly develop nitrate production, the Administrative Office provided maximum assistance to nitrate workers in disaster areas last year. They mobilized nitrate workers from areas with limited nitrate soil to areas with nitrate but lacking technical expertise. Nanhe organized the integration of relocated nitrate workers with landlords, with housing counted as one share and furniture as another. This resolved difficulties related to housing, furniture, and nitrate soil, and also stimulated the enthusiasm of the local population for nitrate production. Linqing City relocated 114 nitrate workers, who then led 233 people, producing 50,000 catties of nitrate in May. Daming and Ningnan first taught a portion of people in base villages and then developed outward on an individual basis. They also mobilized veteran nitrate workers within the city to cooperate with those lacking technical skills, with the more skilled workers receiving a larger share of the profits. In addition, county governments have opened training classes this year, training a large number of technical personnel. In the first phase, Daming, Nangong, Longyao, and six other counties trained 1,369 people. During the training period, they taught techniques and practiced, becoming skilled nitrate workers within a month. The Gaotang and Feixiang Nitrate and Sulfur Bureaus adopted a "learn as you come, rotate and alternate" approach, which proved quite effective. Secondly, local governments provided loans and assistance. The nitrate industry has now developed throughout the region. According to August statistics, there are already more than 13,000 households and over 50,000 nitrate workers. The most widespread development is in Ningnan, Daming, Longyao, Yongnian, and other counties. In Gengzou Village, Ningnan, nitrate workers account for 80% to 90% of the total households. Each person produces two catties of nitrate daily; individuals with high skills can produce four to five catties. One month could produce more than 50,000 catties of nitrate, earning 60,000 catties of grain. There are countless examples of people who became wealthy through nitrate scraping. Therefore, the masses in the Third District of the county can rely on nitrate to survive the famine. The masses said, "The water flooded, but there's rice in the pot"; "Flooding is not a big deal, as long as it doesn't wash away the nitrate soil." Before liberation, the people of Yongnian were starving and on the verge of death. Now, under the leadership of the democratic government, the people have recovered their health and accumulated a lot of grain in less than a year of leaching nitrates. Xin County had only 570 nitrate workers last year, and this number increased to 1,568 in April of this year. This summer, heavy rains and wet soil temporarily reduced production, but nitrate workers came up with many ways to combat natural obstacles. Some people dried the leached nitrate soil for two or three days, piled it up, and then sealed it for twelve or thirteen days before leaching nitrates. Yang Junsheng's family of six in Qilidian rotated four pools for sun-drying and leaching, and the nitrate soil was sufficient without leaving the house. Yan Yinggong also successfully experimented with the same method to leach kang soil. He obtained 60% of the soil from one kang, producing 28 catties of nitrate. The dry month of June was a bad time for the nitrate industry, but now artificial sun-drying is used by hoeing the ground two or three fingers deep, sprinkling a layer of brine, and tamping it with feet. After that, constantly scraping yields inexhaustible amounts. Regarding the quality of nitrate, last year, raw nitrate yielded 50% dry nitrate, and most nitrate blocks had a layer of slag, resulting in poor quality. In the first half of this year, attention was still focused on quantity development, neglecting quality. Moreover, most nitrate workers were newly trained, and their leaching and boiling techniques were not high, resulting in a waste of many raw materials. Since the Nitrate and Sulfur Bureau adopted a "high price for high-quality goods nitrate price policy," nitrate workers mutually evaluate the goods and prices each time they hand in the nitrate. In addition, the political education of nitrate workers has been strengthened to raise their awareness, making them realize the importance of nitrate production for the revolutionary war. Now, the quality of nitrate has gradually improved, with some reaching 71.92%, and the lowest maintaining 67% of the dry nitrate quantity. The future direction of the nitrate industry, besides continuing to develop in large quantities (there are still vast nitrate-producing areas with no one scraping), should also improve quality. Therefore, it is urgent to improve technology, reduce costs, to save national expenditure and increase people's income.

　　培养技术人材有计划的推广
  　冀南硝业扩展全区
    【冀南电】冀南硝业在政府扶持下蓬勃发展，抗战前仅宁南、平乡、大名等县少数人经营。因为当时淋硝是“犯法”的。抗战后摆脱了这种统治，但因销路不多，发展仍不普遍。行署为大量发展硝业生产，去年首先在灾区从各方面给硝民以最大帮助，并动员硝土较少地区的硝民到有硝而没技术的地区。南和组织移来硝民和房东结合，房子算一股，家具也算一股。这样解决了房子、家具、硝土等困难，又带起了当地群众制硝情绪。临清市移来硝民一百一十四人，带领起二百三十三人；五月份即产硝五万斤。大名、宁南在基点村教会一部分人，然后以个人为单位向外发展。又从城内动员老硝民与无技术者合作，分红时，有技术者多分些。此外，各县政府今年曾开办训练班，大批培养技术人材。大名、南宫、隆尧等九县一期就训练了一千三百六十九人。在训练期间，一面讲授技术，一面实习，一月内即学为熟习硝手。高唐、肥乡硝磺局采取随来随教，轮流交替的办法的收效颇大。其次，各地政府贷出粮款帮助与扶持，硝业现已发展至全区。据八月份统计，已有一万三千余户，五万余硝民。发展最普遍者为宁南、大名、隆尧、永年等县。宁南耿走庄硝民，占全村户数的百分之八十至九十。每天一人制硝二斤，个别技术高的能制四、五斤，一月能产销五万余斤，赚粮六万斤。因刮硝而致富者，多不胜举。因此，该县三区群众赖硝足可渡过灾荒。群众说：“水淹了，锅里出米”；“发水不要紧，冲不走硝土就行”。永年未解放时，人民饿得奄奄待毙，现经民主政府领导，淋硝不到一年，全部恢复健康并积余了很多粮食。莘县去年仅有硝民五百七十名，今年四月即增至一千五百六十八人。今夏雨多地湿时，曾一度减少了产量，后来硝工想出很多办法与自然障碍作斗争。有的把淋过的硝土晒两三天，堆起来再闷十二三天就能淋硝。七里店杨俊生一家六口，四个池子轮流晒淋，不出大门硝土就足够用。阎应功用同样方法淋炕土，也试验功。他一座车炕就出土六成，制硝二十八斤。天旱地干的六月为硝业背时，现在经用人工制造晒土，将地皮锄二、三指，泼一层卤水，用脚踏实，以后经常刮则取之不尽。在硝的质量方面：去年毛硝出干硝一般是百分之五十，多数硝块上带着一层渣滓底，质量很差。今年上半年，仍只注意数量发展，忽视质量，再加大部硝民是刚学成的新手，淋熬等技术不高，浪费了很多原料。自硝磺局采取了“货高价高的硝价政策”后，每次交硝时由硝民互相评货、评价。另外，又加强了对硝民的政治教育，提高其觉悟，使硝民认识了制硝对革命战争的重要性。现硝的质量已逐渐提高，有的已达到百分之七十一点九二，最低的也保持百分之六十七的干硝数目。今后硝业的方向，除应继续大量发展外（目前尚有广大产硝地区没人刮制），还应提高质量。为此，急需改进技术，降低成本，以节省国家开支，增加人民收入。
