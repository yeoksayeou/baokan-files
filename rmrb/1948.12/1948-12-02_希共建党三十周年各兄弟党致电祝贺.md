Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 25th. Reports from various sources: The Greek Communist Party celebrated the 30th anniversary of its founding on the 18th in the Greek liberated areas. "Free Greece" radio broadcast pointed out: "The Greek Communist Party's thirty years of glorious struggle, its experienced leadership headed by General Secretary Zachariadis, is the guarantee that the Greek Communist Party will win final victory and that our country will achieve national independence and people's democracy." The Chairman of the American Communist Party, Foster, and General Secretary Dennis, on behalf of the American Communist Party, sent a telegram to the Greek Communist Party to congratulate them. The congratulatory message said: The American people are beginning to understand the significance of the Greek people's historic struggle. The opposition's barbaric behavior towards the Greek people makes the workers and civilians see the true face of the royalist fascist dictatorship evilly supported by Wall Street imperialists. The Greek people's victorious resistance to the Greek traitors, who possess a large amount of American military aid, increasingly makes the American public understand the true situation in Greece and the necessity of rejecting and crushing imperialist war, the Truman Doctrine, and the Marshall Plan. The Central Committee of the Polish Workers' Party also sent a telegram to the Central Committee of the Greek Communist Party to congratulate them, briefly stating: "We are happy for your victory," your struggle "is of utmost importance to the common cause for which our entire anti-imperialist camp is striving, and to the sovereignty of all nations and the establishment of lasting peace."

    希共建党三十周年各兄弟党致电祝贺
    【新华社陕北二十五日电】各方报导：希腊共产党于十八日在希腊解放区庆祝其成立三十周年纪念。“自由希腊”电台广播指出：“希腊共产党光荣斗争的三十年，它的以总书记萨查利阿底斯为首的经验丰富的领导，就是希共将赢得最后胜利、使我国取得民族独立与人民民主的保证。”美国共产党主席福斯特与总书记但尼斯特代表美共致电希共祝贺。贺辞说：美国人民正开始了解希腊人民的历史性斗争的意义。反对派对希腊人民的野蛮行为，使工人与平民看到受华尔街帝国主义者罪恶地支持的保皇法西斯独裁的真面目。希腊人民对拥有大量美国军事援助的希腊卖国贼的胜利抵抗，越来越使美国大众明了希腊的真实情势与摈弃并粉碎帝国主义战争、杜鲁门主义及马歇尔计划之必要。波兰工人党中央委员会亦致电希共中央祝贺，略称：“我们为你们的胜利而感到欢乐”，你们的斗争“对于我们全体反帝国主义阵营为之奋斗的共同事业，对于各民族主权与建立持久和平意义至为重大”。
