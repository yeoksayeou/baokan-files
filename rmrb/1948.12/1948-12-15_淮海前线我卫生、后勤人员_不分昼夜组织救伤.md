Xinhua News Agency, Huaihai Front, December 13th: During the first stage of the Huaihai Campaign, the staff of the front-line medical and logistical departments fully demonstrated the spirit of class friendship and self-sacrifice in rescuing the wounded and reducing deaths. In order to prevent the wounded from collapsing or fainting due to the cold and excessive bleeding, a certain medical department educated its staff during marches and formed working groups to prevent and rescue the wounded from collapse. As a result, more than 70 wounded were prevented from collapsing during combat. A certain stretcher company, under the slogan of "not fearing one battle after another, not abandoning a single wounded soldier," continued to rush to transport the wounded despite more than ten people being injured in the process. A squad leader was himself wounded while rushing to transport the wounded. When others went to rescue him, he said, "It is important that you rescue the soldiers. I can crawl down myself." Under the call of "rescuing the wounded and saving civilian labor," front-line agencies also mobilized logistics personnel to form stretcher teams to rush to the front line to rescue the wounded day and night amidst the intense fighting. Many comrades, despite having swollen shoulders and tired legs, did not rest.

	The wounded who were quickly transported from the front line received careful care from the medical staff upon reaching the hospital. For example, Wang Dongsheng, a nursing squad leader in a certain unit, sucked the pus from the urethra of a wounded soldier named Zhou Zhisan several times with his mouth because he was unable to urinate, alleviating his pain. Xu Peirong, a model female nurse in the same unit, also tirelessly cared for thirteen seriously wounded soldiers day and night, taking off her cotton clothes to垫 (diàn - pad) the wounded, enduring the cold to continue working. Zhang Si and Wen Chongliang, two cooks from a certain health station, continuously boiled 532 pots of boiling water for the wounded for three consecutive days and nights. Another cook, Yao Shanfu, cooked food for 320 people overnight, ensuring that the wounded had water to drink and food to eat. With rapid transportation at the front and careful care and treatment in the hospital, many wounded soldiers have recovered their health. In the middle of last month, more than one hundred gloriously wounded commanders and fighters from a certain unit returned to the front line to kill the enemy. When a certain unit sent personnel to慰问 (wèiwèn - express sympathy and solicitude for) the sick and wounded in a certain hospital and told them that the person in charge of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China assessed the current military situation and pointed out that the Kuomintang bandits could be fundamentally defeated in about a year, Sun Riyou, a wounded soldier, said, "Please go back and tell the leaders and comrades at the front that if my hand can hold a gun, I will go back and fight to defeat Chiang Kai-shek as soon as possible." Another wounded soldier, Gao Xiudong, felt uncomfortable because he was wounded before completing his mission in the first stage of the Huaihai Campaign. He asked the instructor, "Let me go back quickly. If I can't catch up with annihilating Huang Baitao, I must catch up with fighting Qiu Qingquan."

    淮海前线我卫生、后勤人员
    不分昼夜组织救伤
    【新华社淮海前线十三日电】淮海战役第一阶段中，前线卫生、后勤各部门工作人员，充分发扬阶级友爱及自我牺牲的精神，救护伤员，减少死亡。某卫生部门为防止伤员因天寒与流血过多而虚脱、晕厥致死，便在行军途中对工作人员进行教育，并组成预防和抢救伤员虚脱的工作小组，结果在战斗中防止了七十余个伤员发生虚脱的现象。某担架连在“不怕一仗接一仗，不丢一个伤员”的口号下，虽有十余人在抢运伤员中负伤，但仍迅速整理组织，继续抢运。某班长在抢运伤员中自己负伤，别人上前去救护他，他却说：“你们抢救战士要紧，我可以自己爬下去。”前线各机关在“抢救伤员，节约民力”的号召下，于战斗紧张中，也动员勤杂人员组成担架队，不分日夜抢上前线救护伤员。很多同志虽已肩肿腿乏，仍不稍歇。前线抢运下来的伤员，在到达医院后，立即得到卫生工作人员的小心护理。例如，某部看护班长王东胜，因伤员周之三小便不出，便用嘴含住他的尿道连吸数次，最后吸出一口脓来，减轻了他的痛苦。该部模范女看护许配荣，也昼夜不息地看护十三个重伤员，并脱下棉衣给伤员铺垫，自己受冻坚持工作。某卫生所炊事员张四、温崇良两人，连续三昼夜给伤员烧了五百三十二锅开水；另一炊事员姚善福，一个人一夜之间做好三百二十个人的饭，保证了伤员有水喝有饭吃。在前线迅速抢运，医院小心看护治疗下，许多伤员已恢复健康。上月中旬，某部即有一百余名光荣负伤的指战员，重上前线杀敌。当某部派员慰问某所伤病员，并告诉他们中共中央负责人评目前军事形势，指出一年左右即可根本打垮国民党匪帮时，伤员孙日有说：“请你回去告诉首长和前方的同志们，我的手能拿枪了，我就要回去干，争取早点打垮蒋介石。”另一伤员高秀东，感到自己在淮海战役第一阶段中，没有完成任务便负伤了，心里老不痛快。他向指导员要求说：“快让我回去吧，赶不上歼灭黄伯韬，也得赶上打邱清泉。”
