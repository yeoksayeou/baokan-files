　　Does Changing from the Supply System to the Salary System Alter the Nature of Staff?

　　Question: In Comrade Bo Yibo's report at the North China Industry and Commerce Conference, he only mentioned the necessity of changing the "supply system tradition" and replacing it with management methods that can develop production. He did not mention whether the nature of the staff also changes to that of employment. The middle and lower-level staff in the company have low wages, with little or no surplus after their own living expenses, and are unable to afford war service rice. If they are exempted from service, it is not in accordance with the supply system. What should be done? (Wang Yizhi, Yan She Construction Office)

　　Answer: Changing from the supply system to the salary system does not change the nature of revolutionary staff. They still serve the people. It is only a change in the treatment system to develop production. Our current salary system is not an employment relationship. The so-called employment relationship has employers and employees and contains a strong exploitative relationship. Now the staff in our liberated areas are all serving the people and also serving themselves. There is no distinction between employer and employee. We cannot simply regard the salary system as an employment relationship from a formal point of view. It is only a system of treatment. As for some middle and lower-level staff whose wages are very low and equivalent to the treatment of the supply system, this is the contracted system of the supply system and they can be exempted from service and enjoy the same treatment as the supply system. Generally speaking, the wage system is higher than the supply system and should be converted into service rice.

### 供给制改为薪金制职员性质是否改变

　　供给制改为薪金制职员性质是否改变
    问：薄一波同志在华北工商会议报告中只讲到必须改变“供给制传统”代之以能够发展生产的管理方法，而没有讲到职员的性质是否也变为雇用性质。公司里的中等职员和下级职员因工资不高，除自己生活消耗外，结余很少，或则没有，无力出负担战勤米，如让其免服勤务吧，又非是供给制该怎办呢？（岩涉筑路办事处王一之）
    答：供给制改为薪金制，革命职员的性质并未改变，仍是为人民服务，只是为了发展生产，待遇的制度改变了一下，咱们现在的薪金制并不是雇佣关系，所谓雇佣关系，有雇主有雇工，包含着浓厚的剥削关系，现在咱们解放区的职员，都是为人民服务，也是为自己服务，并没有雇主和雇工之别，不能只从形式上把薪金制就当成雇佣关系，它只是待遇上的一种制度，至于说中下级职员有的工资很低和供给制的待遇相当者，这是供给制的包干制，可免服勤务和供给制享受同等的待遇，一般的说，工资制是高于供给制的，应折纳勤米才对。
