Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains, 10th. The Zhengzhou Municipal People's Government's work to restore production has achieved initial results. The Mingyuan Electric Light Company, after receiving a substantial loan of 2.25 million Zhongzhou currency from the Industry and Commerce Bureau, has been supplying electricity to city streetlights and general users since November 17th. Among the 39 machinery and iron industries, 33 have resumed operations. Their products, such as cotton gins, weaving machines, waterwheels, automobile parts, noodle cutters, and iron pots, are selling very well. Hua Xingyuan alone has produced and sold 13 cotton carding machines, cotton gins, and noodle cutters in the past month. All 22 flour mills in the city are actively improving their machinery and equipment and expanding production. Commercial vehicles, since starting operations on the 12th of last month, are now running smoothly on the Zheng (zhou)-Xu (chang), Zheng (zhou)-Fan (shui), and Zheng (zhou)-Bian (liang) lines. More than 90% of the city's shops have reopened. Yongfeng Printing Factory and others, which were forced to close down due to heavy taxes under Kuomintang rule, have also resumed operations one after another.

After eliminating rapidly depreciating counterfeit currency, prices in Zhengzhou have stabilized and fallen. Currently, each person only needs 50 Zhongzhou currency per day to have enough to eat. Comparing prices in the city before the ban on counterfeit currency on November 3rd with those on November 22nd, in 20 days, among the six essential commodities—rice, millet, flour, salt, coal dust, and cotton—only cotton increased by 25%, from 80 yuan to 100 yuan per catty. The remaining five items all decreased in price, as follows: rice decreased from 24 yuan to 10 yuan per catty, a decrease of 59%. Millet decreased from 13 yuan to 10 yuan per catty, a decrease of 21%. Flour decreased from 20 yuan to 16 yuan per catty, a decrease of 20%. Salt decreased from 36 yuan to 29 yuan per catty, a decrease of 20%. Coal dust decreased from 2 yuan to 1.6 yuan per catty, a decrease of 20%.

Accompanying the recovery of industry and commerce and the increasing stability of social life, in addition to already accepting and delivering ordinary mail, express mail, and registered mail to various liberated areas, the Zhengzhou Post Office began handling remittance services between Zhengzhou and Kaifeng, Luoyang, and other places on November 26th. The Zhongzhou Farmers Bank's Zhengzhou branch is also actively preparing to establish remittance services with Heze, Handan, Changzhi, Jincheng and other places in the North China Liberated Area.

    工商业恢复物价稳跌
    【新华社中原十日电】郑州市人民政府恢复生产工作，现已获得初步成绩。明远电灯公司，在得到工商局的巨额贷款中州币二百二十五万元后，十一月十七日起，已对全市路灯及一般用户电灯供电。机器铁工业卅九家中，已有三十三家开工。他们所产轧花机、织布机、水车、汽车零件、切面机、铁锅等，销路甚畅。仅华兴原一家，一个月来制成并售出的弹花、轧花机、切面机即有十三部。全市二十二家面粉厂，正在积极改进机器设备，扩大生产。商业汽车自上月十二日起开始营业后，现已畅通郑许（昌）郑泛（水）、郑汴各线。全市大小商店开业者已有百分之九十以上。国民党统治时，因苛捐杂税被迫歇业的永丰印刷厂等，也已先后复业。
    郑市在排除急速贬值的伪币之后，物价稳跌。现每人每天只需五十元中州币即可温饱。该市物价，如以十一月三日未禁伪币前与十一月二十二日相较，在二十天内，大米、小米、面粉、食盐、煤末、棉花六种生活必需品中，除棉花上涨百分之二十五，即由每斤八十元涨至一百元外，其余五种物品均下跌，计：大米由每斤二十四元下跌至十元，即下跌百分之五十九。小米每斤十三元下跌至十元，即下跌百分之二十一。面粉每斤由二十元下跌至十六元，即下跌百分之二十。食盐每斤三十六元下跌至二十九元，即下跌百分之二十。煤末每斤二元下跌至一元六角，即下跌百分之二十。
    伴随工商业的恢复及社会生活的日趋安定，郑市邮局除早已收递各解放区的平信、快信、挂号信外，并于十一月廿六日起办理郑州与开封、洛阳等地的通汇业务。中州农民银行郑州分行，也正积极筹备建立与华北解放区的菏泽、邯郸、长治、晋城等地的汇兑。
