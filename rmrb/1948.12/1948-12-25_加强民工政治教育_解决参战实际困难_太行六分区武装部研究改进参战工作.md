　　Strengthening Political Education for Civilian Laborers, Resolving Practical Difficulties in Participation
    Taihang Sixth Military Subdistrict Armed Forces Department Studies Improvements in Participation Work
    [Taihang News] The Taihang Sixth Military Subdistrict Armed Forces Department, in order to more effectively support the war and overcome the shortcomings and biases in participation work, specifically conducted research and discussions on participation work in the district cadre training class, clarified the basic reasons for desertion, and proposed specific practices for the future. In the past, two basic problems in participation work had not been resolved quickly and appropriately, which greatly affected participation work. First, because the management, education, and preparatory work for participation had not been done sufficiently in peacetime, many biases were generated. Generally, civilian laborers lacked complete class consciousness, only having a general class consciousness of overthrowing feudalism and obtaining land, without further political consciousness of overthrowing the Kuomintang reactionary ruling class, liberating the whole country, and thoroughly turning themselves over. Therefore, they only looked at the present and not the future, only cared about themselves and not others, and only saw that there were no enemies in front of them, and were unwilling to go out and participate in the war.
    In addition, there was a lack of ideological, organizational, and material preparations for participation. Some areas (such as Shahe) did not dare to carry out ideological mobilization for participation in front of the masses, and precisely because ideological preparation was not carried out (or not done enough), the organization and material preparation were very poor. When the time came, they were caught unprepared, resorting to orders, arrests, or hiring; and even the shoes and socks of the militiamen and civilian laborers, and the allocation of cadres and administrative personnel in the companies, could not be done in time. After departure, this increased the difficulties in all aspects and affected the morale for participation.
    Second, because the practical problems in past participation had not been properly resolved, the mobilization of the masses to participate in the war was also greatly affected. For example, the labor exchange between the front and rear was unfair, the labor accounts were unclear, or even not counted; some did not commend the civilian laborers who bravely participated in the war, and did not give appropriate punishment and education to the few saboteurs or deserters; the labor burden in some villages was unbalanced, causing dissatisfaction among the civilian laborers who participated more; and some areas did not take good care of the families of civilian laborers who were killed or injured in the war. All of these problems had a great impact on participation work. In order to overcome these shortcomings and biases in participation and to more effectively support the war in the future, the following suggestions are put forward:
    (1) It is necessary to widely conduct current affairs education and future prospects education among the masses, so that everyone understands that only by overthrowing the Kuomintang reactionary group and liberating the whole country can we defend and consolidate our own fruits of liberation and live a good life forever.
    (2) Strengthen peacetime preparation for participation. Constantly use various forms (cadre meetings, reviews, etc.) to conduct regular or irregular inspections. In addition to carrying out individual or collective material preparation, it is necessary to equip competent military and political cadres and select experienced administrative cadres and staff to manage life, which is one of the important tasks to consolidate civilian laborers.
    (3) Seriously solve the problems that existed in past participation. Each county should formulate a reasonable system for exchanging labor for participation according to different situations. If this work can be done well, the contradiction between participation and production can be largely resolved.
    (4) Strictly enforce organizational discipline and establish a system of rewards and punishments.
    (5) Conscientiously implement the preferential treatment regulations and provide good care for the families of those who sacrificed or were injured in the war.

### 加强民工政治教育  解决参战实际困难  太行六分区武装部研究改进参战工作

　　加强民工政治教育  解决参战实际困难
    太行六分区武装部研究改进参战工作
    【太行讯】太行六分区武装部，为了更有力的支援战争，克服参战工作中的缺点与偏向，特在区干轮训队中对参战工作专门进行了研究讨论，明确了逃亡的基本原因，提出了今后具体做法。过去的参战工作，存在着两个基本问题未得到迅速适当的解决，致参战工作受到很大影响。第一、由于平时对参战的管理教育及准备工作做的不够，因而产生了很多偏向。一般民工缺乏完整的阶级觉悟，只有一般的打倒封建得土地的阶级觉悟，没有进一步打倒国民党反动派统治阶级解放全国彻底翻身的政治觉悟。因此只看现在不看将来，只管自己不管别人，只看到自己眼前没有敌人，即不愿外出参战。
    另外是缺乏参战的思想、组织、物质等准备工作。有的地区（如沙河）不敢在群众面前进行参战的思想动员，正由于不进行思想准备（或做的不够），而组织、物质的准备，也就很差。到时就手忙脚乱，不是命令、便是抓球，或是雇佣；并且对民兵、民工的鞋袜衣服，连队的干部及事务人员的配备，都来不及做好。出发后，增加了各方面的困难，影响参战情绪。
    第二、由于对过去参战中的实际问题未得到适当解决，因而在动员群众参战上也受到很大影响。如有的前后方变工不公道，工帐不清，甚至不算；有的对英勇参战的民工没有进行表扬，对少数破坏分子或开小差的分子未有进行适当处罚和教育；有的村劳力负担不平衡，引起参战多的民工不满；有的地区对参战伤亡的民工及其家属照顾不够。以上这些问题，对于参战工作都有很大影响。为了克服参战中这些缺点与偏向，今后更有力的支援战争，特提出以下意见：
    （一）必须在群众中广泛的进行时事教育和前途教育，使大家明确只有打倒国民党反动集团解放全国，才能保卫与巩固自己的翻身果实，才能永远过好时光。
    （二）加强平时的参战准备工作。不断利用各种形式（干部会、检阅等），举行定期或不定期的检查，除进行个人或集体的物质准备外，必须配备能胜任的军政干部，选择有经验的事务干部及事务人员管理生活，这是巩固民工的重要工作之一。
    （三）认真解决过去参战中存在的问题。各县根据不同情况，规定合理的参战变工制度。这一工作如能做好，参战生产的矛盾即可求得大体解决。
    （四）严格组织纪律，建立赏罚制度。
    （五）认真的执行抚恤条例，对参战牺牲或负伤的家属给予很好的照顾。
