Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th. TASS reports: The Soviet Union is currently preparing for the election of people's courts. The election of the people's courts is scheduled to take place in December 1948 and January-February 1949. According to Article 109 of the Soviet Constitution, people's judges and people's assessors are elected by universal, direct, and equal suffrage, using secret ballot. The broad participation of the Soviet people in the activities of the courts is one of the forms of the people participating in the management of their country. On each election day, any citizen who is 23 years old and has never committed a crime can be elected as a people's judge or people's assessor. Among the people's judges of the Russian Federation, there are representatives of more than fifty nationalities within the Federation. More than 60 percent of the people's judges of the autonomous republics and autonomous regions of the Russian Federation are representatives of the nationalities that constitute the majority of the local population. In the Georgian Republic, 88 percent of the people's judges are Georgians. In the Azerbaijan Republic, 83.2 percent of the people's judges are Azerbaijanis.

　　The democratic nature of the Soviet people's court lies not only in the fact that it is elected by the people, but also in the fact that the people's judges must make regular reports to their voters. The Soviet court makes decisions independently, without being subject to any influence. No local government agency or higher judicial body instructs the people's court to make any decision contrary to its ruling. Article 112 of the Soviet Constitution states: "Judges are independent and subject only to the law." No one can remove a judge. If he is incompetent, only the voters have the right to recall him.

　　In the people's court, each case is tried by one people's judge and two assessors. The people's assessors participate in deciding all possible issues, such as adjourning trials, summoning witnesses, arresting or releasing defendants, etc. People's assessors have the same voting rights as people's judges in deciding verdicts and determining penalties in criminal cases, or in passing decisions on civil cases. Soviet people's assessors not only enjoy equal rights with people's judges, but also, in certain circumstances defined by law (such as when people's judges are sick or on vacation), have the right to replace people's judges. When people's assessors perform their duties in court, they continue to receive their salaries from their original factories or institutions. This enables workers and other employees who are elected as people's assessors to actively participate in the work of the people's court, which is the basic link of the Soviet judicial system, and to hear most civil and criminal cases without worrying about their livelihood.

　　苏筹备人民法庭选举
  　人民可以广泛参加法庭活动
    【新华社陕北十三日电】塔斯社讯：苏联现正筹备人民法庭的选举事宜。人民法庭的选举，订于一九四八年十二月及一九四九年一、二月内举行。按照苏联宪法第一○九条规定，人民法官及人民陪审官按普遍、直接、平等选举制，用秘密投票法选举之。苏联人民广泛参加法庭的活动，是人民参加管理他们国家的形式之一。每到选举日，年满廿三岁、从未犯罪的公民均可被选为人民法官或人民陪审官。俄罗斯联邦的人民法官当中，有联邦境内五十多个民族的代表。俄罗斯联邦各自治共和国与各自治州的人民法官，有百分之六十以上是占当地大多数人口的各民族的代表。在乔治亚共和国，有百分之八十八的人民法官是乔治亚人。在阿塞拜疆共和国，有百分之八十三点二的人民法官是阿塞拜疆人。
    苏维埃人民法庭的民主性质，不仅在于它是由人民选举出来的，而且也在于人民法官必须向他们的选民作定期的报告。苏维埃法庭是独立作出决定，而不受任何影响的。不论任何当地的政府机构、也不论任何高级的司法机关，都不责成人民法庭作出任何与其裁决相反的决定。苏联宪法第一百一十二条说：“法官独立，他只服从法律。”没有谁能撤换法官。如果他不称职的话，只有选民才有权罢免他。
    在人民法庭中，每一个案件均由一位人民法官和两位陪审官审讯，人民陪审官参与决定一切可能发生的问题，如延期审讯、传证人到庭，逮捕或出释被告等等。人民陪审官在决定判决与确定刑事案件的刑罚、或在通过民事案件的处理决定时，享有与人民法官一样的票决权。苏联人民陪审官不仅享有与人民法官平等的权利，而且在法律所确定的某些情况下（如在人民法官患病或休假的情况下），有权代替人民法官。人民陪审官在法庭执行职务时，在他原来工作的工厂或机关照样领取薪资。这使那些被选为人民陪审官的工人及其他雇员们，没有生活的顾虑，能够积极地参加作为苏维埃司法制度之基本环节的人民法庭的工作，并审理大部分民事与刑事案件。
