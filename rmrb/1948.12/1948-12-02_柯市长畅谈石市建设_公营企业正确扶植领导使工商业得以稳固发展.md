[News from our paper] Mayor Ke Qingshi discussed the progress of Shijiazhuang's construction over the past year during the celebration of the first anniversary of Shijiazhuang's liberation. He first pointed out: "In the year since Shijiazhuang's liberation, through the arduous efforts of the Communist Party and the People's Democratic Government uniting the city's people, it has transformed from a commercial city serving the supply of raw materials and the sale of finished products for American imperialism and the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang into a people's production city." He said: The guiding principle for Shijiazhuang's construction over the past year has been what Chairman Mao has often taught us: “Develop production, invigorate the economy, take into consideration both public and private interests, and benefit both labor and capital” and “Protect and lead industry and commerce.” Therefore, despite the many difficulties we faced, a year of hard work has finally enabled the economic construction of Shijiazhuang to take a big step forward. First of all, we stabilized prices. The ample supply of materials has effectively guaranteed the relative stability of prices: prices have risen two and a half times in the past year, with an average monthly increase of about 20 percent, especially the rise in daily necessities such as food and coal has been even slower. This not only ensured the people's livelihood but also created objective conditions for the normal development of general industry and commerce. At the same time, within a few months, we repaired the entire 700-plus li (Chinese mile) section of the Yangquan-Dezhou railway line, making it a major artery running through the entire North China and East China liberated areas. In addition, public enterprises' support for mass production and the financial and trade departments' control and support for stabilizing prices, circulating funds, and facilitating the exchange of materials have enabled the entire industry and commerce to move towards recovery and development. He excitedly pointed out: The development trend of the entire industry and commerce can be seen from the two main commercial streets: Zhongshan Road (Chaoyang Road) originally had 210 industrial and commercial establishments. Before liberation, there were only 192. After liberation, by the end of July, 22 were closed or changed occupations, 81 were newly opened or transferred from other industries, and 2 that had closed before liberation resumed business, totaling 253 establishments. Minquan Street (Daqiao Street) originally had 148 establishments before liberation, and there were actually 127 at the time of liberation. After liberation, 3 resumed business, 5 closed, and 28 newly opened, totaling 153 establishments. This shows that only in the liberated areas, with the active support of the Communist Party and the People's Government, can industry and commerce have the conditions and foundation for recovery and development.

Regarding municipal construction and political development, Mayor Ke said: "Over the past year, we have cultivated a large number of urban cadres loyal to the people's cause. They try their best to consult with the masses on major issues. When the masses have difficulties, they spare no effort to run around all day to find appropriate solutions. For example, during enemy air raids, they bravely rescued injured people. During this summer's rainy season, many houses collapsed. Some cadres visited families in the heavy rain to help the masses solve their accommodation problems. Therefore, the relationship between cadres and the masses is generally becoming closer." At the same time, he announced: "Before the end of this year, people's congresses will be established in the streets to elect and organize people's elected street governments. Next spring, a city-wide people's congress will be convened to elect a people's democratic government, so as to push the democratic politics of Shijiazhuang forward as soon as possible." There has also been progress in municipal construction: "After liberation, public utilities such as electricity, telephone, and running water were immediately restored, and many new installations were added, and timely repairs were guaranteed after enemy air raid damage. In maintaining public security and protecting the lives and property of the people, we have taken various necessary measures, suppressed and exposed the infiltration and sabotage of Chiang's secret agents, and defended against enemy air raids. After our North China People's Liberation Army, in coordination with the broad masses of militia, smashed the shameless conspiracies of Chiang Kai-shek's and Fu Zuoyi's bandit troops to launch two sneak attacks on Shijiazhuang, Shijiazhuang has become a permanently consolidated people's city."

Speaking of Shijiazhuang's fiscal revenue in the past year, Mayor Ke said: "In order to eliminate the Kuomintang's exploitative system of harassing and harming the people, we have abolished the baojia system of apportionment and all kinds of exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies, which were the most disruptive to the people. Now, no organ or individual is allowed to apportion any funds to the citizens. The exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies during the Chiang Kai-shek bandit's rule that we have abolished include: property rental and sale income tax, inheritance tax, banquet tax, entertainment tax, baojia fees, conscription fees, ditch fees, road repair fees, forage fees, security fees, and other unknown exorbitant taxes and levies.

Currently, we only collect agricultural tax, industrial and commercial tax, transaction tax, slaughter tax, etc. At the same time, we take from the people and use it for the people. The collection of these taxes is also for the various construction projects of the city and to support the national people's liberation war. The burden on the people generally does not exceed 25 percent of their total income. At the same time, our principles in the collection work are: first, it must be subject to the democratic deliberation of the people themselves, and the burden must be fair and reasonable; second, based on the conditions of military needs and civilian use, we should collect the burden while enabling the people's production to achieve greater development. In other words, taxes are taken from the increased income of the people.

Finally, Mayor Ke raised several issues from summarizing the experience of Shijiazhuang's construction work over the past year: "First, we must fully understand the objective conditions of this construction work: Shijiazhuang has undergone years of semi-colonial, semi-feudal, and bureaucratic capital rule and exploitation, as well as the destruction and looting by Chiang's bandit troops. It is like recovering from a serious illness, and it must have a considerable period of rest and recuperation before it can recover. The transition from the old economy to the new economy also requires a difficult transformation process, and we must not be complacent. At the same time, after the land reform, the productive forces in the countryside were liberated, and the purchasing power of the peasants increased, forming a new urban-rural relationship, which laid a sufficient foundation for the development of New Democratic industry and commerce, and required the city's production to improve to adapt to these new circumstances. We must be prepared, patient, and realistic in organizing and developing the city's production. Any blindness or impatience is harmful and unhelpful.

"Second, we must clarify that industry should be the focus of Shijiazhuang's construction. The demands of the war, the needs of the people, and the construction of New Democracy all require striving for greater development of industry. The supply of raw materials such as coal, iron, cotton, and oil, and the convenience of north-south and east-west railway transportation, enable Shijiazhuang to have the conditions for developing industry in terms of raw materials and transportation. However, industrial construction is not an easy task. The biggest difficulty at present is machinery and technology. Therefore, we must first support and develop handicrafts and small industries (machine industry, iron industry, chemical industry, and cotton weaving industry, etc.).

"Third, we must correctly understand the different components of the new urban economy. In the past, we lacked analysis and research on this issue, and there were some confused ideas in our minds, which made it impossible to correctly grasp policies in complex and intricate relationships. The socio-economy of Shijiazhuang after liberation is composed of several parts: the public-owned economy, the cooperative economy, private capitalism, and small producers. Although the number of public enterprises is smaller than that of private ones, the amount of capital is quite large, and they control materials and transportation closely related to the people's livelihood, such as grain, cloth, oil, and salt. Therefore, they have played a decisive role in stabilizing prices and ensuring supply. For example, during this war preparation, a few private merchants hoarded and speculated, fueling market fluctuations. Public enterprises united cooperatives and stabilized the market in just three hours. At the same time, public enterprises always help private small industries or handicraftsmen in the difficulties in the production process. Public enterprises do their best to run many undertakings that are beneficial to the social economy but that private individuals are unwilling or unable to establish, regardless of profits. The construction process over the past year has fully demonstrated the leading role of public enterprises in the New Democratic economy. Therefore, in the economic construction of New Democracy, we must vigorously develop the public-owned economy and give full play to its leading and supporting role in the cooperative economy and the private economy.

　　柯市长畅谈石市建设
  　公营企业正确扶植领导使工商业得以稳固发展
    【本报讯】柯庆施市长于庆祝石家庄解放一周年畅谈一年石市建设经过，首先指出：“石家庄在解放后的一周年当中，经过共产党和人民民主政府团结全市人民的艰苦奋斗，已由供销原料，推销成品，为美帝国主义及国民党反动统治服务的商业城市，变成了人民的生产城市”。他说：石市一年来的建设方针，就是毛主席所经常教导我们的：“发展生产，繁荣经济，公私兼顾，劳资两利”和“保护与领导工商业”的方针。所以尽管许多困难摆在我们面前，但一年的努力，终于使石家庄的经济建设工作前进了一大步。首先，我们稳定物价，由于物资的充分供应，有力地保证了物价的相对平稳：一年内物价上涨两倍半，平均每月上涨百分之二十左右，尤其是食粮煤炭等日用必需品的上涨速度更慢。这不仅保证了人民生活的饱暖，更替一般工商业造成了正常发展的客观条件。同时，几个月的时间内，修复了阳德全线七百余华里的铁路，成为贯串整个华北华东解放区的一条大动脉，加上公营企业对群众生产的扶助，金融贸易部门对于稳定物价周转资金及便利物资交流的掌握与扶助等，使整个工商业走向恢复与发展。他兴奋地指出：整个工商业的发展趋势，从两条商业中心的大街即可看出：中山路（朝阳路）原有工商业二一○户，解放前只有一九二户，解放后到七月底歇业或转业者二十二户，新张或他业转来的八十一户，解放前停业现在复业的二户，共二百五十三户。民权街（大桥街）解放前原有一四八户，解放时实有一百二十七户，解放后复业者三户，歇业者五户，新张者二十八户，共有一五三户，这说明了只有在解放区，在共产党和人民政府的积极扶持下，工商业才有恢复与发展的条件和基础。
    在市政建政方面，柯市长说：“一年来我们已经培养了大批忠于人民事业的城市干部，他们遇有重大事情都要尽可能的和群众商量。群众有困难，无不千方百计终日奔波求得适当的解决。如在敌机轰炸中，英勇抢救受伤群众，今夏雨季中，房屋塌毁很多，有些干部在大雨中挨家探望，帮助群众解决住宿问题，因之干部与群众的关系，一般地是日益密切了。”同时宣布：“今年年底以前成立街的人民代表大会，选举并组织人民民选的街政府，明年春天召集全市人民代表大会，选举人民的民主政府，使石市的民主政治，尽快地向前推进一步。”在市政建设方面也是有成绩的：“解放后立即修复了电灯、电话、自来水等公用事业，增添了许多新的装置，并保证了敌机轰炸破坏后的及时修理。在维护治安，保障人民生命财产方面，我们曾作了各种必要的措施，镇压和揭露了蒋特的潜入破坏，对于敌机空袭进行了防护，自我华北人民解放军配合广大民兵武装粉碎了蒋傅匪军两次偷袭石家庄的无耻阴谋之后，石庄已成为一个永久的巩固的人民城市。”
    谈到一年来石市的财政收入情况，柯市长说：“为了消灭国民党扰民害民的剥削搜敛制度，我们取消了扰民最甚的保甲摊派及一切苛杂，现在任何机关或个人，都不得再向市民摊派任何款项。蒋匪统治时期的苛杂被我们废止的有：财产租赁出卖所得税、遗产税、筵席捐、娱乐捐、保甲费、壮丁费、沟壕费、修路费、草料费、治安费还有其他不知名的苛杂税捐。
    目前，我们征收的只有农业税、工商税、交易税、屠宰税等，同时又是取之于人民用之于人民，这些税收的征收也是为了全市人民的各种建设，以及支援全国人民解放战争。对于人民的负担，则一般地不超过其总收入的百分之二十五。同时在征收工作中我们的原则是：第一必须经过人民自己的民主评议，负担务求公平合理。第二根据军需民有的条件，在使人民生产事业得到更大的发展中缴纳负担。换句话说，税收是由人民增多的收入中拿出来的。
    最后，柯市长从总结石家庄一年建设工作的经验中，提出几个问题：“第一、必须充分认识这个建设工作的客观条件：石家庄是经过了多年的半殖民地半封建与官僚资本的统治剥削以及蒋匪军的破坏搜刮，有如大病之后，必须有一个相当时期的休息生养方可复原，而由旧经济走向新经济也需有一段艰难的改造过程，决不能自满。同时土地改革后农村生产力解放，农民购买力增高，构成了新的城乡关系，为新民主主义的工商业的发展打下了充分的基础，要求城市生产提高一步，能够适应这些新的情况。我们必须有准备的、耐心的、实事求是的来组织与发展城市的生产，任何盲目与性急都是有害无益。
    “第二，必须明确石家庄的建设，工业应是他的重心。战争的要求，人民的需要，及新民主主义的建设，都要求争取工业的更大的发展。煤、铁、棉花、油类等原料的供给及东西南北铁路运输的便利，使石家庄具备了发展工业的原料与交通的条件。然而，工业的建设不是一件轻而易举的事，当前最大的困难就是机器与技术。因之首先必须扶植与发展人民需要的手工业和小工业（机器工业、铁工业、化学工业与棉织业等）。
    “第三，必须正确的认识新城市经济中的几个不同的构成部分。过去对这一问题缺乏分析研究，思想上存有某些糊涂观念，致使在复杂与错综的关系中不能正确的掌握政策。解放后的石家庄社会经济是由：公营经济、合作经济、私人资本主义与小生产者等几部分构成。其中公营企业数量上虽比私人的少，但资金数目相当大，而且掌握了粮食、布匹、油、盐等和人民事业密切有关的物资和交通事业，所以在稳定物价保证供给上，是起了决定作用的。如这次备战中，少数私商囤积投机助长市场波动，公营企业团结了合作社仅在三小时中就把市场稳定下来。同时私人小型工业或手工业，在生产过程中的困难，总是公营企业给以帮助，许多有益于社会经济的事业，私人所不愿或不能创办的，公营企业则不计利润尽力兴办。一年来的建设过程完全证明了公营企业在新民主主义经济中的领导作用。因之在新民主主义的经济建设中，必须以大力来发展公营经济，并充分发挥其对合作经济及私人经济的领导与扶植作用。
