    [Jizhong 26th Dispatch] Frontline reporter Fu Li reports: The newly liberated people of Zhuo, Liang, and Wan counties have bravely stood up and joined the wave of supporting the front, enthusiastically helping the People's Liberation Army dig fortifications and transport grain. When the county command post allocated five rubber-wheeled carts to Hanjia Fort on the 17th, seven carts came voluntarily. When they asked Shifa for ten carts, thirty-five carts came as a result. When the troops came to stay, the masses actively vacated rooms, heated the kangs, and boiled water. Some landlords in Zhoukou, Tiangezhuang, and other villages even lit stoves for the soldiers and took care of them intimately. When the soldiers politely declined, they always refused to agree. Zai Dianchen of Liangjiawu said, "You are doing this for the common people, and the common people should also care for their own army!" An old lady in Taipingzhuang said, "Since you came, my chickens haven't been sold. When the Bai Bozi (referring to the Chiang Kai-shek and Fu Zuoyi bandits) came, I hid them." Then she poured out the suffering of the people caused by the Chiang Kai-shek and Fu Zuoyi bandits who conscripted soldiers and seized grain. Before the arrival of the People's Liberation Army, the puppet Da Township of Panggezhuang even demanded 38.4 jin of corn and 19.1 jin of wheat per mu of land from each village, to be paid within five days. They said, "If you had come a few days later, we wouldn't have been able to live. Now is the time for us to take revenge!" In order to support the front, the villages organized temporary village offices to actively plan for grain for the People's Liberation Army, grinding corn flour day and night. On the 18th alone, the villages sent 28,000 jin of flour to the county. They said, "Just say what you need, we have people if you need people, and we have grain if you need grain." The young and strong in Dingfuzhuang go to the grain station every day after breakfast to help with the work. Old teacher Gao Xianshi is busy writing slogans and keeping accounts. He said excitedly, "After the enemy came, I hid myself. Now that our army has come, needless to say, I have to work in the front." The stretchers and carts in each village have been organized and are ready. According to the statistics of 13 villages in the Fourth District, 190 carts and 94 stretchers have been prepared, just waiting for the order to go to the front.
    [Jizhong 27th Dispatch] Frontline reporter Li Fu reports: During the battle on the periphery of the liberation of Beiping, the Anping stretcher team was in high spirits. They rescued the wounded under fire, successfully completed their mission, and were praised by the troops. The civilian workers of Zhuo County and Fangshan County all set up meritorious service plans and vowed to rescue the wounded on the front line. Civilian worker Li Dapian wrote his meritorious service plan on a small flag and planted it at the door. On the evening of the 12th, when the battle began, they scrambled to go to the front line. The Fifth Company was with the assault troops, and they proposed, "We are willing to go wherever the troops are transferred." Zhang Junbang and Wang Ruichang's stretcher team rescued the wounded under fire; they carried them carefully up and down the mountains for more than a dozen li in one breath. The stretcher bearers responsible for rear transportation responded to every call. They transported the wounded from the front to the rear as soon as they were carried down, without caring about eating or drinking, and took care of the wounded meticulously. Many meritorious models emerged. According to the statistics of the first, third, and fourth companies of the regiment, 29 people helped the wounded with urination, 264 people gave their quilts and cotton-padded coats to the wounded to keep warm, 49 people bought food for the wounded, 11 people fed the wounded, and 9 people carried the wounded on their backs on the front line. During the battle, many team members went to the front line despite being ill.
