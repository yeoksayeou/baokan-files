Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th. Electric News Agency reports: The Central Committees of the Polish Workers' Party (Polish Communist Party) and the Polish Socialist Party held a joint plenary session in Warsaw on the 3rd of this month to actively plan for the merger of the two parties and decided on the agenda of the unified new party's national congress to be held on December 8th. Bolesław Bierut, General Secretary of the Polish Workers' Party and President of Poland, emphasized the task of the unified working-class party in his report at the joint plenary session, stating: "It is necessary to make the working people realize that the unification of the two parties means an increase in the role of the party in the working class, an increase in the role of the working class in the working masses, and an increase in the role of the working masses in the people and the country." "To win the trust of millions of people, the unified party must clearly point out the direction of development, organize the creative labor of the masses, express the deepest concern for the material and spiritual needs of the working people, and be responsible for constantly improving living standards." After the close of the plenary session, a draft of the unified Workers' Party constitution was published and is now being deeply discussed by organizations at all levels of the two parties for final adoption at the national congress on December 8th. The new draft constitution specifies that the Polish Workers' Party is the party that led the national and social liberation struggle during the occupation of the Hitler bandits, prepared the conditions for the masses of the people to seize power and laid the foundation for people's democracy after liberation. The unified party will base itself on the ideological achievements of the Polish Workers' Party. The Polish Socialist Party inherited the tradition of the left wing and firmly stood on the unified position of the working class, regenerating the Socialist Party, thereby contributing to the unified party with its political achievements. The draft constitution clarifies that party membership does not confer any privileges but only special responsibilities to the party, to the non-party working masses, to the country, and to the nation. The draft constitution stipulates that party members must undergo a one-year probationary period. During the probationary period, members participate in the work of various party units, study Marxism-Leninism and the experience of the international workers' movement, especially the Bolshevik Party. And satisfactorily prove to the group and party committee that he has obtained the qualifications of a party member. The draft constitution also states: The party will be based on the principles of democratic centralism. The unified party's line of action is the international solidarity of the working class.

	At the same time, in order to welcome the final unification of the two parties, organizations at all levels of the two parties are carrying out party rectification. According to a certain leader of the Workers' Party, "Party rectification is a fresh and good breeze, sweeping away all opportunists, nationalists, and hostile elements from the party." "Without party rectification, the task of architects of a new socialist society cannot be completed."

	Approximately 1,500 delegates from the Workers' Party and the Socialist Party will participate in the national congress on December 8th. Foreign delegations invited include communist parties from European countries, the French Left Socialist Party, and communist parties from the Americas, China, Korea, India, Southeast Asia, and Palestine.

	The Polish Trade Union announced that when the two parties hold a unification ceremony on December 8th, which is also the moment when the state of division of the working class finally ends, all factories will sound their sirens to congratulate the workers on their new party.

    波共社两党中央联合举行全会
  　筹划两党完全统一
    现正进行整党扫清敌对分子
    【新华社陕北二十六日电】电通社讯：波兰工人党（波共）与波兰社会党两党中央委员会于本月三日在华沙举行联合全会，积极筹划两党合并事宜，并决定行将于十二月八日起举行的统一的新党全国代表大会的议程。波兰工人党总书记、波兰总统贝鲁特在联合全会作报告时，着重指出统一的工人阶级政党的任务称：“必须使劳动人民认识到：两党之统一意味着党在工人阶级中的作用之增大，工人阶级在劳动群众中的作用之增大，和劳动群众在人民与国家中的作用之增大。”“要博得千百万人民的信任，统一的党必须明确指出发展的前途，组织群众创造性的劳动，表示最深切地关怀劳动人民物质与精神需要，并负责经常改善生活水平。”全会闭幕后，公布了统一的工人党党章草案，现正交由两党各级组织进行深刻讨论，以便在十二月八日全国代表大会上最后通过。新党章草案指明：波兰工人党是在希特勒匪徒占领期间领导了民族与社会解放斗争、准备了使人民群众在解放后取得政权和奠定人民民主的条件的党。统一的党将以波兰工人党所获的思想成就作为基础。波兰社会党继承了左翼的传统，并且坚决地站到工人阶级统一的立场，使社会党再生了，从而以它这种政治成就对统一的党作了贡献。党章草案说明党籍并不赋有任何特权，而是只有对党、对非党劳动群众、对国家、对民族的特别责任。党章草案规定党员须经一年的候补期。党员在候补期间参加党的各单位工作，学习马列主义国际工人运动、特别是布尔什维克党的经验。并向小组及党委令人满意地证明他已取得了党员的资格。党章草案又说：党将以民主集中制的各项原则为基础。统一的党的行动方针乃是工人阶级的国际团结。
    同时，为迎接两党的最后统一，两党各级组织正进行整党，据工人党某领导人称：“整党是一股新鲜的好风，正将一切机会主义者、民族主义者与敌对分子从党内清扫出去。”“要是不整党，就完成不了社会主义新社会建筑师的任务。”
    十二月八日的全国代表大会将有工人党及社会党约一千五百名代表参加。被邀请的外国代表团有欧洲各国共产党，法国左翼社会党，美洲、中国、朝鲜、印度、东南亚及巴勒斯坦等共产党。
    波兰职工会宣布，当两党在十二月八日举行统一典礼，亦即工人阶级的分裂状态终于结束的时刻，所有工厂将齐鸣汽笛，作为工人们对他们的新政党的祝贺。
