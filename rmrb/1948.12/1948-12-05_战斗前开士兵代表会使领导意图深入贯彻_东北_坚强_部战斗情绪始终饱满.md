Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, December 2nd: The experience of the "Strong" unit of the Northeast Field Army proves that convening soldiers' representative meetings plays a significant role in maintaining broad contact between unit leaders and rank-and-file soldiers, and in ensuring that leadership intentions are better implemented among the soldiers. During the entire Autumn Offensive, the unit held three soldiers' representative meetings during lulls in the fighting, which kept the troops' morale high. Soldiers consistently demonstrated bravery and tenacity in battle, strictly adhered to policies and discipline, and helped each other in marching and combat, acting as brothers. On September 9th, on the eve of the Autumn Offensive, the unit convened its first soldiers' representative meeting to launch a "Capture the Flag" campaign. At the meeting, the unit's leaders called on all representatives: First, to promote a style of fierce attack and tenacious combat, to complete the tasks of each battle, and to capture the "Heroic and Skilled in Battle" flag. Second, to strictly implement policies, abide by discipline, and capture the "No Offenses Against the People" flag. Third, to raise political consciousness, unite the entire army like an iron fist, not to fall behind, not to desert, and to capture the "Solidarity and Unity" flag. The unit leaders also stated that anyone who had the determination and confidence could take the award flag back first, but if the task was not completed well, the award flag would have to be returned. The meeting immediately saw a heated competition for the flags. Representatives of the "Shu Zhi" Changling Company and the "Fa Zhi" Second Company successively took the stage, expressing confidence, justification, and conditions to capture the flags in the future. They then swore an oath before the flags, promising to complete the three major tasks called for by the leaders, and then took the flags first. Those who did not get the flags first resolutely stated that they would take practical actions to capture the flags and challenged them, competing with each other. After the meeting, the representatives returned to their respective units, and a mass "Merit-Making and Flag-Capturing" campaign immediately unfolded in the troops. Competition challenge letters flew like snowflakes.

On October 4th, the unit completed the task of inserting into the enemy's heart along the Beining Railway, cutting off the enemy's connection between Xingcheng, Jinxi, and Huludao, and successfully fired the first shot of the Autumn Offensive. At this point, the campaign action came to an end. In order to celebrate the victory of the initial battle of the Autumn Offensive, commend meritorious individuals and units, and mobilize the troops to make persistent efforts to win the battle to capture Jinzhou and prepare for the arduous and glorious task of blocking enemy reinforcements, the unit held its second soldiers' representative meeting. At the meeting, the unit leaders summarized the experience of this initial victory, commended the fifteen model units and the four heroes who had made three great contributions in one battle, and awarded them award flags and medals. Then, the representatives held group discussions, reviewed the merit-making and flag-capturing plan, reaffirmed their determination to capture the award flags, and challenged the winning units in the initial battle of the Autumn Offensive. After the meeting, the representatives returned to their companies to convey the spirit of the meeting, and a new wave of combat enthusiasm swept from top to bottom. They unanimously expressed their determination to be "as fierce as tigers in attack and as stable as Mount Tai in defense," to resolutely defeat the enemy's reinforcements, to cooperate with fraternal units to take Jinzhou, and to thoroughly complete the three major tasks, in order to finally win the three major flags.

During the Jinzhou Campaign, the unit fought bravely and arduously for seven days and nights in the Tashan area south of Jinzhou, thwarting Chiang Kai-shek's personally planned reinforcement of Jinzhou by nine divisions, creating a brilliant example of a blocking battle, and ensuring the great victory of annihilating 100,000 enemy troops in Jinzhou. On October 25th, the unit held its third soldiers' representative meeting to celebrate the victory, award prizes, and hold a grand celebration. At the meeting, the model units in this blocking battle were commended and awarded honorary titles such as "Hero of Defense" and the banner of "Awe-Inspiring to the Enemy." The unit leaders called on everyone at the meeting to not be arrogant, to strive to make great contributions, to unite, educate, and consolidate new soldiers, to fight even bigger victories, to maintain vigorous killing enthusiasm, and to improve tactics and techniques even further. After the representatives returned to their respective units to convey the message, the soldiers were filled with confidence in victory and asked for new tasks, guaranteeing that they would do well in all aspects of marching, combat, policy implementation, mutual assistance, and friendship, and perfectly realize the leaders' hopes for them.

　　战斗前开士兵代表会使领导意图深入贯彻
    东北“坚强”部战斗情绪始终饱满
    【新华社沈阳二日电】东北野战军“坚强”部的经验证明：召开士兵代表大会，在使部队首长和士兵群众的骨干保持广泛的接触，使领导意图在士兵中更好地得到贯彻等方面，作用很大。该部在整个秋季攻势期间，利用战斗间隙开了三次士兵代表大会，使部队的战斗情绪始终高涨，使士兵们在战斗中始终表现英勇顽强，在执行政策纪律上真正做到秋毫无犯，在行军和作战中做到互相帮助，亲如手足。该部于九月九日秋季攻势行动前夕，即召集首次士兵代表大会，开展夺旗运动。会上该部首长号召全体代表：第一，发扬猛打猛冲、顽强战斗的作风，完成每次战斗的任务，夺取“英勇善战”的大旗。第二，严格执行政策，遵守纪律，夺取“秋毫无犯”的大旗。第三，提高政治觉悟，作到全军团结得象一个铁拳一样，不掉队，不逃亡，夺取“巩固团结”的大旗。该部首长还提出，如果谁有决心和信心，可以先把奖旗拿回去，但如果任务完成得不好，还得把奖旗送回来。会场上当即展开热烈的争旗挑战。该部“曙支”长岭连和“发支”二连代表先后登台表示有信心、有根据、有条件在将来夺取大旗，于是在会上进行了旗前宣誓，保证完成首长号召的三大任务，随即将大旗先拿了去。没有先拿到旗子的，则坚决表示将以实际行动来夺取大旗，并向他们挑战，互相进行竞赛。大会闭幕，代表们分别回去以后，部队中立即展开了群众性的立功夺旗运动。竞赛挑战书如雪片飞传。
    十月四日，该部于北宁路上完成了插入敌人心脏，切断兴城、锦西、胡芦岛之间敌人联系的任务，胜利地打响了秋季攻势的第一炮以后，战役行动至此告一段落。为了庆祝秋攻初战的胜利，嘉奖有功的个人及单位，并动员部队再接再厉，争取攻取锦州战斗的胜利，迎接艰巨而光荣的打援任务，该部又举行了第二次士兵代表大会。会上该部首长总结了这次初战胜利的经验，表扬了这次战斗中的十五个模范单位与四个在一次战斗中连立三大功的功臣，分别授予奖旗奖章。接着代表们分组座谈，检查了立功夺旗计划，重申夺取奖旗的决心，并纷纷向秋攻初战中的优胜单位挑战。会后，各代表回连队中传达了大会的精神，自上而下又卷入了新的战斗热潮，一致表示决心，要“攻如猛虎，守如泰山”，坚决打垮敌之增援部队，配合兄弟部队拿下锦州，彻底完成三大任务，以便最后争取三面大旗。
    该部于锦州战役中，在锦州以南的塔山一带经七昼夜的奋勇苦战，粉碎了蒋介石亲自部署的九个师的援锦计划，创造了阻击战的光辉范例，保证了锦州歼敌十万的伟大胜利。十月二十五日，该部又召开第三次士兵代大会，进行祝捷、给奖、大庆功。会上嘉奖了此次阻击战中的各模范单位，分别授予“守备英雄图”等光荣称号及“威震敌胆”的锦旗。该部首长在会上号召大家要毫不骄傲，努力立大功，团结、教育与巩固新战士，打更大的胜仗，保持旺盛的杀敌情绪，把战术与技术更加提高一步。各代表会后回去进行传达后，战士们都充满了胜利信心，纷纷要求给予新任务，保证在行军作战、执行政策、互助友爱各方面都能做好，完满地实现首长对他们的希望。
