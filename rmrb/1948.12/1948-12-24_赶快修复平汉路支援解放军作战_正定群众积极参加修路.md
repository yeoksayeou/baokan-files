　　Hasten the Repair of the Pinghan Railway to Support the People's Liberation Army in Combat
    Zhengding Masses Actively Participate in Road Repair
    [Beiyue Telegram] The masses in Zhengding are actively rushing to repair the Pinghan Railway. From the beginning of this month to the 13th, they completed the restoration of the roadbed of the Hutuo River to Xinle section, a distance of more than 50 li. The broad masses of peasants and merchants understand that the restoration of this route has a significant effect on coordinating the annihilation of the Chiang Kai-shek-Fu Zuoyi bandit troops. The saying "Hurry up and repair the Pinghan Railway to support the front lines in destroying Chiang Kai-shek and Fu Zuoyi" is spreading everywhere. The projects originally planned to take five days in Hejiazhuang and Baijiazhuang in the Fourth District were completed within three days. Zhengding City, under the difficult conditions of having many merchants and few tools, mobilized women and children to participate in picking up stones and filling potholes, completing the task ahead of schedule. The North China Railway Bureau specially presented two brocade flags and one towel to the model units and individuals with outstanding achievements in road repair.

　　赶快修复平汉路支援解放军作战
    正定群众积极参加修路
    【北岳电】正定群众积极抢修平汉路。自本月初至十三日完成滹沱河至新乐段长达五十多里的路基的修复。广大农民和商人，懂得这条路线的修复对配合消灭蒋傅匪军有重大作用，“赶快修复平汉路，支援前线灭蒋傅”这句话到处传播着。四区合家庄、白家庄原拟需要五天的工程，都在三天内完成。正定市在商人多工具少的困难条件下，动员妇女、儿童也参加拾石子、填土坑，提前完成任务。华北铁路局特置锦旗两面，手巾一部赠予修路成绩优异的模范单位及个人。
