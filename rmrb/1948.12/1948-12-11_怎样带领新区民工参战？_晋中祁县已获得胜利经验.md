    How to Lead New Liberated Area Laborers to Participate in War?
    Qixian County, Jinzhong, Has Obtained Victory Experience
    [Jinzhong Electric] The supporting-the-frontline laborers in Qixian County, Jinzhong New Liberated Area, have undergone practical training in supporting the front for fifty days, and their appearance has been completely renewed. They have not only completed arduous tasks in supporting the front, but also the laborers feel that they are tense and happy in supporting the front. Many heroes and models have emerged, and valuable experience in organizing and leading the masses in the New Liberated Area to support the front has been obtained. At the beginning of the Taiyuan Campaign, due to the lack of thorough organization and education in advance, coupled with the laborers suffering from the exploitation and deception of the Yan bandit army, their thinking was very chaotic at the beginning. In particular, the organization and leadership were not strong enough after the event, and the emotions of some laborers became even more depressed. Phenomena such as homesickness, running away, and feigning illness were common. Even some district and county cadres who led the laborers were full of sorrow, thinking that the laborers in the New Liberated Area were difficult to lead and the tasks were difficult to complete. Now it is completely different. The 4th company of the 1st battalion had not eaten for more than a day in the trenches, and everyone was still discussing how to rescue the wounded and why they should not violate mass discipline. Team member Jia Shuancheng broke his back while carrying grain, and encouraged everyone, saying: "I will rest for two days and still lead the way." Xian Jiong's face was bruised, but he still rescued the wounded as usual. Others advised him to go down and apply medicine, but he refused everyone: "I will never implicate everyone, and I will not go down if I don't complete the task." The 5th company originally had 31 sick people, but now only 16 are left. The 6th company has a total of 82 laborers, originally with 16 stretchers, but after evaluation and challenge, it has increased to 34. Many odd-job personnel and cadres also carried stretchers. Liu Bingyuan of the 3rd company of the 1st battalion covered the wounded with his own quilt when sending the wounded, fearing that they would be cold, and picked up firewood while walking, preparing to make a fire for the wounded. On November 25th, when the 1st battalion held a congratulatory meeting, Liu Peikang, who had run away, also said: "I will never run away again, and I will see you at the next meritorious service meeting!" According to statistics, in the fifty days since the departure, among the 1,200 people in the 1st and 2nd battalions, a total of 59 people have made great contributions, and 608 people have been commended. In particular, the 2nd company of the 1st regiment of the 1st battalion has never had a single person run away. They successfully completed their tasks and took the time to help the masses harvest 133 mu of autumn crops.
    The reasons why they were able to achieve these results are mainly: (1) First of all, they overcame the laborers' chaotic thoughts and clarified their understanding of supporting the front. When the laborers first left their homes, their thoughts were very chaotic. They were afraid of suffering, afraid of guns and cannons, and afraid that they would not be able to do things at home. After gathering, they seized a tight day to carry out mobilization in an enlightening way, explaining why they were fighting Taiyuan, who they were relying on to fight, and condemning Yan Xishan's crimes. They also compared the current life with the past life. The battalions and companies further explained during marches and rests, so that everyone realized that fighting Taiyuan was for themselves and participating in the war was glorious. After such explanations, some people were reminded of the past, and they linked participation in the war with their own vital interests. For example, Yan Guangyi said: "I have lived for fifty years and have been bullied by Yan Xishan for more than 20 years. This is the time for us to avenge ourselves." Lu Zhixin, who used to be a militiaman, also said: "We did bad things in the past, this time we must redeem ourselves and make contributions." (2) Timely political mobilization and continuous persuasion and education are the guarantees for keeping the team members' morale full. The laborers in the New Liberated Area have low political consciousness, so their emotions are also most easily fluctuated. This requires political education and mobilization work to consolidate them. For example, the 1st company transported equipment for three days and nights without rest, and some people felt very tired. At this time, the 2nd platoon leader said to everyone: "The more we contribute, the less bloodshed the troops will have. The People's Liberation Army is fighting Taiyuan for us. If we don't suffer a little, what can we say?" This greatly boosted everyone's energy. Once, the 4th company transported artillery shells to the front line. When they arrived at the designated location, the troops had moved. At this time, some people were very panicked. The company commander explained to everyone at this time: "Don't be afraid, there are our troops all around. We have eliminated two divisions of the enemy, and this division cannot escape either." When he guided everyone to continue to move forward to find the troops, he encouraged everyone: "Everyone hurry up and follow me, as long as you keep up with the team, there is no danger." Finally, they successfully completed the task under enemy fire. Mobilization and explanation work must pay attention to mobilizing activists. Only when the activists among the masses rise up will mobilization play a greater role. The 6th company of the 1st regiment transported artillery shells. Everyone was tired from walking and had to pass through a large mountain. At this time, Wang Hengyou said to everyone: "In the past, the enemy forced us to build the Baishi Ridge blockhouse, forcing each person to carry more than 100 kilograms, and they didn't even let us eat enough every day; now what is it if we carry 70 kilograms." This greatly encouraged everyone. The 1st company rescued the wounded on the battlefield. Because the enemy's artillery fire was fierce, everyone shrank back. Wu Jun said to everyone: "You hide well, I will go forward and carry them for you, and you can carry them down." At that time, not only was the task completed, but also everyone's morale was improved. (3) The cadres' example and meticulous care for the laborers are also extremely important. The masses in the New Liberated Area pay the most attention to our cadres' every move, which is often a very important point for them to understand our party and our army. For example, once, under enemy fire, the task of transporting artillery shells was very arduous. The company commander and instructor carried a box themselves and left, and others also transported it without hesitation. One night, the 4th battalion arrived at Wunaogou. There were few houses and few households. When the battalion commander saw that there was no way, he first untied his bedding to camp in the open. At this time, although the team members were very cold, no one complained and they spent the cold night. A team member said: "This is really a cadre of the People's Liberation Army. Look, the officials suffer from the cold just like us." At the 1st battalion's congratulatory meeting, the instructor first saluted everyone to congratulate them, and the company commander and instructor lit cigarettes for everyone, which greatly moved the laborers. Wang ××, who had run away, said: "The officials light cigarettes for the common people, and they treat people really well. Next time I want to make meritorious service and also eat honorable cigarettes." (4) Carry out the activity of evaluating merits and learning from the good. At the beginning, some people were skeptical and ideologically resistant, mainly because they did not understand what the evaluation of merits and learning from the good was all about. When the self-reporting, public discussion, superior approval, and mutual review of each platoon and company were announced from the bottom up, everyone's morale was high. In particular, after the "report of meritorious service" was sent to the village, many laborers attached great importance to it, and a challenge competition was launched. Luo Baoheng of the 1st battalion said: "My merit is not yet counted. When Taiyuan is taken down and a general meeting is held in the county, the merit I make will be counted." The evaluation of merits and making contributions further enlightened everyone's understanding. Chen Yujun of the 4th company said: "Today I have made meritorious service thanks to the Communist Party. If I were still under the oppression of the Second War Zone (referring to the Yan bandit army), not to mention making meritorious service, I would not even be able to eat." The evaluation of merits and making contributions movement of the 2nd Brigade proves that: First, it is necessary to cultivate activists, otherwise the deadlock cannot be broken. The method of discovering activists is mainly from understanding the composition and history of the employees and from discovering them in their work, otherwise they will be deceived by some opportunists. Secondly, the evaluation of merits must be cautious and serious, and the combination of self-reporting, public discussion, superior approval, and mutual review must be combined. In the evaluation of merits and learning from the good, the political understanding and ideological consciousness of employees must be continuously improved according to the progress of the movement. (5) Improving the food and adjusting the life also greatly encourages the laborers in the New Liberated Area, because they have suffered from hunger and cold under the exploitation of the Yan bandits and their lives are very hard. A laborer in the 4th platoon said: "According to this kind of life, I will not go back this year. The food is food and the dishes are dishes. I haven't eaten this kind of food for several years." They use various methods to improve their lives. The 1st battalion chopped a total of 36,500 kilograms of firewood without affecting the task, which improved the food. At the same time, making life gradually active, such as running, singing, propaganda, and literacy, is also very important, so that they do not feel bitter and dry in their lives. (6) Unblocking the links between the front and rear, and eliminating employees' concerns. The masses in Nantuanbai Village, 3rd district, came to the front to comfort them with shoes and socks, and told them about the situation at home and the congratulatory situation in the village, which greatly encouraged the team members. Some also use the method of writing letters to express condolences, sending back and persuading the fleeing laborers, or sending some oil and salt to adjust their lives, all of which greatly encourages the team members.

    怎样带领新区民工参战？
    晋中祁县已获得胜利经验
    【晋中电】晋中新区祁县支前民工，经过五十天的支前生活实际锻炼，面貌一新，不仅完成了艰巨的支前任务，而且民工都感到在支前中紧张愉快，出现了不少功臣模范，取得了组织领导新区群众支前的宝贵经验。太原战役开始时，由于事先未进行周密的组织教育，加之民工饱受阎匪的压榨欺骗，开始思想很混乱，特别是事后组织领导不够坚强，一些民工的情绪更形低落，想家、逃跑、装病等现象曾普遍发生，甚至一些带领民工的区县干部也满带愁怅，认为新区民工不好带，任务难以完成。现在却完全不同了，一营四连在战壕里一天多没吃上饭，大家还在讨论如何抢救伤员，为什么不该犯群众纪律。队员贾拴成，扛粮摔坏了背胯，还鼓舞大家说：“我休息两天还要引路带头。”献颉丙脸上挂了彩，还照常抢救伤员，别人劝他下去涂药，他拒绝了大家：“我绝不连累大家，完不成任务不下去。”五连原有病员三十一个，现只剩了十六个。六连共民工八十二人，原有十六付担架，自经过评功挑战后，增为三十四付了，好多勤杂人员和干部也抬上了担架。一营三连刘丙元，送伤员时怕伤员冷，盖上了自己的被子，还边走边拾柴火，准备给伤员烤火。十一月二十五日，一营召开贺功大会时，开小差回来的刘培康也发言说：“今后决不再开小差，下次立功会上再见！”据统计，自出发至今五十天的光景中，一、二营一千二百人中，共有五十九人立了大功，六百零八人记了好，特别是一营的一团二连，从未跑过一个人。他们胜利地完成了任务，并抽暇帮群众秋收一三三亩。
    他们所以能获得这些成绩的原因主要是：（一）首先克服了民工的混乱思想，明确了民工的支前认识。民工刚出家门时，思想很乱，怕受苦，怕枪炮，怕家中的事干不了等，他们在集合好后，抓住了很紧凑的一天时间，用启发的方式进行动员，说明了为什么打太原，靠谁打，控诉了阎锡山的罪恶，并拿现在和过去的生活对比。各营各连又在行军休息中进行了更进一步的解释，使大家认识打太原是为了自己，参战是光荣的。经过了这样的解说后，就引起一些人对过去的回忆，而把参战与自己的切身利益连系起来。如阎广义说：“我活了五十岁，就受了阎锡山廿多年的欺负，这是咱们报仇出气的时候了。”过去当过民卫军的吕智新也说：“过去咱们干了不好的事，这次要雪耻立功。（二）及时的政治鼓动和不断的说服教育是使队员情绪保持饱满的保证。新区民工政治觉悟低，所以情绪也最易波动，这就特别需要政治教育与鼓动工作来加以巩固。如一连运器材三昼夜没休息，一些人就感到很疲劳，这时二排长向大家说：“咱们多出力，部队就少流血，解放军打太原是为了咱们，要再不吃点苦，可有什么好说呢？”一下把大家的劲给鼓起来了。一次，四连向阵地上运炮弹，到了指定地点部队转移了，这时一些人就很恐慌，连长在这时向大家解释说：“不要怕，四周都是咱们的军队，咱们已消灭了敌人两个师，这个师也跑不了。”当他引导大家继续前进找部队时，又鼓励大家说：“大家赶快跟着我走，只要跟上队，就没危险。”终于在敌人炮火下胜利完成了任务。鼓动解释工作必须注意发动积极分子，只有当群众中的积极分子起来后，鼓动才会起更大作用。一团六连运炮弹，大家走累了，要通过一个大山，这时王恒有向大家说：“过去敌人强迫咱们修白石岭炮楼，每人强迫搞一百多斤，每天还不叫吃饱饭；现在咱们扛七十斤还算什。”给大家鼓了很大一把劲。一连在战地抢救伤员，因敌人的炮火猛烈，别人都畏缩起来，武俊向大家说：“你们隐蔽好，我上前给你们去扛，扛下来你们再抬。”当时不仅完成了任务，而且提高了大家的情绪。（三）干部的以身作则，和对民工的周密照顾，亦极为重要。新区群众对我们干部的一行一动最注意，这往往是他们认识我党我军的很重要的一点。如一次，在敌炮火下运炮弹，任务很艰巨，连长、指导员自己扛起一箱就走，别人也都毫不迟疑的运起来。一天晚上，四营到了五闹沟，房小户少，营长看到没法，便先解开自己的被包要露营，这时队员虽然很冷，谁也没发牢骚就度过了寒夜。一个队员说：“这真是人民解放军的干部，你看人家当官的，与咱一样受冷。”在一营贺功大会上，教导员先给大家敬礼贺功，连长指导员给大家点烟，对民工的感动很大，开小差的王××说：“当官的给老百姓点烟，待人真强，下次我要立功也吃吃光荣烟。”（四）开展评功学好运动。开始，曾遭到一些人的怀疑和思想上的抵抗，主要是由于不了解评功学好是怎么一回事。而当各排各连自下而上的评议审查宣布后，大家的情绪高了，特别是贺功和把“报功单”送给本村后，很多民工非常重视，一直掀起了挑战竞赛。一营罗保恒说：“我这功还不算，等打下了太原，全县开大会时立了功才算功。”从评功立功中，更启发了大家的认识。四连陈玉俊说：“今天我立功是共产党给的，如果我还在二战区（按指阎匪）压迫下，不用说立功，连饭也吃不上。”二大队的评功立功运动证明：首先，必须培养积极分子，否则打不开僵局。而发现积极分子的方法，主要是从了解员工的成份历史和从工作中发现，否则就会被一些投机分子所迷惑。其次，评功时必须要慎重认真，要把自报公议上级批准和互相审查结合起来，在评功学好中必须根据运动的进行而不断提高员工的政治认识和思想觉悟。（五）改善伙食，调剂生活，对新区民工鼓舞也很大，因他们在阎匪压榨下饱受饥寒，生活很苦。四排一个民工说：“照这样的生活，我今年就不回去了，饭是饭菜是菜，几年来不吃这饭了。”他们用各种办法来改善生活。一营在不影响任务下，共打柴三万六千五百多斤，改善了伙食。同时使生活逐渐活跃，如跑步、唱歌、宣传、识字也很重要，使他们生活不感苦燥。（六）疏通前后方连系，解除员工顾虑。三区南团柏村群众，拿着鞋袜来前方慰劳，并告诉他们家中情形和村里贺功情形，对队员鼓励很大。也有的用写信的方法进行慰问，对逃亡民工送回和劝解，或送来一些油盐调剂生活，都对队员有很大鼓励。
