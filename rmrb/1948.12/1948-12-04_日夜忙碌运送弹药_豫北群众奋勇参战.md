　　Working Day and Night to Transport Ammunition
  　Northern Henan Masses Vigorously Join the War Effort
    [Taihang Telegram] In the liberated areas and newly recovered areas of northern Henan, tens of thousands of people are bravely participating in the war effort to support the People's Liberation Army, working day and night to eliminate the Chiang bandit troops and liberate all of northern Henan as soon as possible, completing glorious war service tasks such as transporting grain, delivering ammunition, and carrying stretchers. In the operations west of Xinxiang, the old liberated areas of the Fourth Military Sub-district sent a total of thousands of civilian laborers to follow the People's Liberation Army, braving difficulties and dangers to travel to the front lines, heroically completing serious and intense war service work. The civilian laborers from the former border areas have an extraordinarily high enthusiasm for participating in the war, unanimously and excitedly reflecting, "Seeing that the Chiang bandit troops in northern Henan will be wiped out! What do we fear about suffering a bit? We'll soon have peaceful days and no longer fear having our grain robbed and being conscripted!" The people in the newly recovered areas, who have just been liberated from the bloody claws of the Chiang bandits, have finally waited for the day to take revenge, and their enthusiasm for supporting the front lines is extremely high. The masses in Muluan Town (Xincheng, Wuzhi), which was liberated on the 25th, are vying to participate in the war. The broad masses of peasants in the rural areas northwest of Xinxiang, which was only recently liberated, are organized to supply grain and form stretcher teams, enthusiastically supporting the People's Liberation Army besieging Huojia. The civilian laborers transporting grain along the Daokou-Qinghua Railway in Xiuwu used the method of people pushing and pulling railway cars to ensure the rapid supply to the front lines of Huojia, saving a large amount of manpower. Twenty or so people transported more than 60,000 catties of grain at a time, and some even made round trips of nearly a hundred li in a day. Since the beginning of the month, the first batch of civilian laborers have been flocking to the front lines. The masses in Hongdong Village, Lin County, have been particularly enthusiastic in signing up to participate in the war, saying, "The Northeast has been liberated, and our northern Henan will soon be liberated. This participation in the war is the last battle at our doorstep." The youth, Yuan Wentang, insisted on being assigned to a stretcher team to go to the front. Many village armed cadres in Qinyang are vying to sign up to participate in the war, saying, "If we don't do it now, when will we do it?"
