    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 9th: Tokyo dispatch: The Japanese Communist Party, under the various persecutions of the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries, has not only not been weakened, but is growing stronger day by day. According to TASS, citing the Japanese Communist Party's organ "Akahata": the Social Democratic Party organizations in Aomori Prefecture have merged with the Communist Party, and this event has created an example for all loyal Social Democrats in other prefectures. The newspaper continued: a worker leader of the Toyo Company in Hokkaido, a member of the executive committee of the Social Democratic Youth Department, has joined the Communist Party. The movement of workers joining the Communist Party is not only seen among members of the Socialist Party, but also among members of the New Labor-Farmer Party. For example, Kudo, the leader of the New Labor-Farmer Party in Aomori Prefecture, issued a statement dissolving the organization and joining the Communist Party. Other leaders of the organization agreed with and supported Kudo's actions. Since Kudo is a member of the Central Committee of the National Railway Workers' Union, many members of the union in Aomori Prefecture may follow his example. Ariga, the leader of the New Labor-Farmer Party organization in Nagano Prefecture, has also left the branch and joined the Communist Party. At the same time, according to Agence France-Presse citing "Akahata": since May of this year, 6,000 soldiers released from the Soviet Union have joined the Communist Party, and many other returnees are applying to join the Communist Party. The Korean newspaper "International Times," published in Japan by Korean residents, also emphasized the strengthening of the Japanese Communist Party. The newspaper stated: A large number of intellectuals and artists have joined the Communist Party, and many farmers in northern Japan have also joined the Japanese Communist Party.

    在与美日反动派斗争中
    日本共产党壮大
    【新华社陕北九日电】东京消息：日本共产党在美日反动派种种迫害下，不但没有被削弱，且正日益壮大中。据塔斯社引日共机关报“赤旗报”称：青森县社会民主党各组织，已与共产党合并，这一事件已为其他各县一切忠诚的社会民主党人创造了范例。该报继称：北海道东洋公司工人领袖、社会民主党青年部执行委员会委员一人已加入共产党。工人们加入共产党的运动，不仅见于社会党党员中间，而且也见于新工农党党员中间，例如青森县新工农党领袖工藤，曾发表解散该组织及参加共产党的声明，该组织的其他领袖都赞同和支持工藤的行动。由于工藤是国营铁道工人工会中央委员会的委员，青森县该工会的许多会员，或将效法他的先例。长野县新工农党组织领袖有贺，亦已脱离该支部加入了共产党。同时，据法新社引“赤旗报”称：从今年五月份以来，自苏联释放返国的士兵中，已有六千人加入共产党，另有许多归国者正在申请加入共产党。朝鲜侨民在日本发行的报纸“国际时报”，也着重指出日本共产党的增强。该报称：大量的知识分子、艺术工作者加入了共产党，日本北部的许多农民也加入了日共。
