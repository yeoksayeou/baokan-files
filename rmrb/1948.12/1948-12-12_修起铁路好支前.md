Repair the Railway to Better Support the Front

With continuous victories at the front, everyone is very happy. Everyone is working hard on production and construction to support the front in winning even greater victories. These days, the masses in Xingtai, Handan, Yuanshi and other counties are busy from dawn till dusk repairing the Pinghan Railway. Some have completed five-day plans in just three days. Their morale is high, and they all say: "This is being repaired for ourselves. The sooner it's repaired, the sooner we'll overthrow Chiang Kai-shek! It will be convenient for us to transport coal!"

Our fellow villagers who do not live near the railway should also step up production. Where roads are bad or bridges are damaged, we should repair them while we are not too busy. This way, supporting the front and production will be more convenient.

    修起铁路好支前
    前线不断胜利，人人都很喜欢，大家正努力生产建设，支援前线打更大的胜仗。这几天，邢台、邯郸、元氏等，好几县的群众，正起早搭黑的忙着修复平汉铁路，有的五天的计划，三天就完成了，情绪很高，都说：“这是给咱自己修的，早修好早打倒蒋介石；咱运输烧煤都方便了！”
    咱们不靠近铁路的老乡们，也该加劲生产，那里路不好，桥坏了，也要趁不很忙的时候把它修补好，这样，支前生产都便当。
