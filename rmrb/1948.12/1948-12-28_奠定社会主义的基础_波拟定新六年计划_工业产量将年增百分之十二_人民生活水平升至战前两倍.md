Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 25th. TASS and Electric Communication Agency report: Mintz, former member of the Political Bureau of the Polish Workers' Party, in his report to the Polish United Workers' Party Congress on the 18th, explained in detail the content of the six-year economic plan from 1950 to 1955. Mintz pointed out that the main task of this plan is to build the foundations of socialism in Poland. The six-year plan stipulates that industrial production will increase by 11 to 12 percent annually. By 1955, industrial production will increase by 85 to 90 percent compared to 1949, so that the total industrial production of Poland will increase to three times that of pre-war levels. The six-year plan will raise the living standards of the working people by 55 or 60 percent compared to 1949, raising them to twice pre-war levels.
　　Mintz pointed out that "building the foundations of socialism in Poland" is the basic principle of the six-year plan. He explained that it is impossible to build socialism in six years, because a complete classless society cannot be built in six years. Capitalist factors cannot be completely eliminated in six years. The small-scale production economy cannot be automatically transformed into a socialist economy in six years. However, Mintz emphasized that the foundation of socialism will be laid within six years. This means that capitalist factors will be restricted to such an extent that they cannot play a decisive role in any economic field.

　　奠定社会主义的基础
  　波拟定新六年计划
    工业产量将年增百分之十二
  　人民生活水平升至战前两倍
    【新华社陕北二十五日电】塔斯社与电通社报导：原波兰工人党政治局委员明兹，在其十八日向波兰两工人政党统一大会所作的报告中，详细说明了自一九五○年至一九五五年六年经济计划的内容。明兹指出：这一计划的主要任务是在波兰建设社会主义的基础。六年计划规定工业生产量每年增加百分之十一至十二。到一九五五年，工业生产量将比一九四九年增加百分之八十五到九十，这样，波兰工业的总生产量就将增加到战前的三倍。六年计划将使劳动人民的生活水平比一九四九年提高百分之五十五或六十，提高到战前的两倍。
    明兹指出“在波兰建设社会主义的基础”是六年计划的基本原则。他解释称：要在六年内建设社会主义是不可能的，因为不能在六年内建设一个完整的没有阶级的社会。资本主义因素不能在六年内全部肃清。小生产经济不能在六年内自动转变为社会主义经济。但是，明兹强调在六年内将奠定社会主义的基础。这就是说：资本主义因素将受到这样的限制，使他们在任何经济领域中都起不了决定作用。
