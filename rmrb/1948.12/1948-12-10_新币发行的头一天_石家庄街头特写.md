　　The First Day of New Currency Issuance
  　A Special Feature of Shijiazhuang Streets
    Xia Jingfan
    Today is the first day that the new currency issued by the People's Bank of China meets the people of Shijiazhuang, and everyone is extraordinarily excited because the new currency symbolizes that nationwide victory is not far away.
    The bulletin boards and reading boards on the streets are crowded with people from morning to night, all showing a relieved expression as if they are looking at a major victory announcement.
    People on the streets and in the alleys say to each other as soon as they meet: "It's coming soon! Have you seen the People's Bank of China's banknotes? It's coming soon! It's coming soon!" with a smile full of confidence in victory.
    As soon as the Shijiazhuang branch opened in the morning, people crowded in wanting to see what the new currency looked like. Everyone who withdrew money requested to be given some new currency, with a feeling of "seeing it first for pleasure." A businessman who was withdrawing money walked to the entrance of the bank, saw the announcement of the new currency issuance, and immediately went in to request that he be given some new currency; when he got it, he looked at it again and again, and finally wrapped it in a towel, put it around his waist, patted his pocket, and said: "Look how convenient this is."
    The branch was exceptionally lively this day, with requests to see samples, requests to exchange samples first, and requests to have some new currency included in withdrawals, the tellers were overwhelmed. When people got the new currency for the first time, they always stared at it repeatedly. When reporters asked them what their thoughts were, a worker wearing a worker's uniform pointed to the two new banknotes he had just received and said: "I think soon there will be a Chinese People's Government leading all of China."
    People who have not seen the new currency are eager to see it right away, and if a piece is occasionally found in the market, it is snatched up like a treasure in a fierce competition.
    Several vendors on the street were moving their fingers to calculate the exchange rate between the People's currency and the old currency. A seller of "Hawthorns" said: "Before, my strings were 100 yuan in Ji banknotes, now they are one yuan, and in the future I will call: 'One yuan a string—'." A sesame cake seller continued: "My sesame cakes are also one yuan each!" They all laughed.

　　新币发行的头一天
  　石家庄街头特写
    夏景凡
    中国人民银行成立和发行的新币，今天是头一天和石家庄的人民见面，为了新币象征着全国胜利为期不远，大家都兴奋异常。
    街上的布告栏、阅报栏从早到晚都挤满着人，象看一个很大的胜利消息一样都露出一幅欣慰的表情。
    街头巷尾的人们一见面就说：“这可快啦！你看到中国人民银行的票子没有？快啦！快啦！”带着充满胜利信心的微笑。
    石家庄分行早上一开门，就有人挤进去要新币的样子看。提款的人人都要求搭配一部分，人们存着一种“先睹为快”的心情。一个提款的商人走到银行门口，看到发行新币的布告，随着进去就要求给他搭配新币；当他拿到手时，看了又看，最后把它包在手巾里住腰里一装，拍着口袋说：“看这多方便。”
    这一天的分行显得异常热闹，要求看样的，先换样子的，提款要求搭配一部分的，营业员们大有应接不暇之势。当人们第一次拿到新币时，总是反复地凝视着。记者问他们有什么感想，一个穿工人装的指刚拿到手的两张新币说：“我看不久就有领导全中国的中国人民政府了。”
    没有看到新币的人们都在渴望着马上看一下，市场上偶而发现一张，就被你争我夺的象至宝一样的抢着。
    几个小贩在街上搬着指头算人民券和旧币的比价，一个卖“山里红”的说：“我这从前是冀钞一百元一串，现在是一块钱了，以后我就叫：‘一块钱一串——’。”一个卖烧饼的接着说：“我这烧饼也是一块钱一个！”他们都笑了。
