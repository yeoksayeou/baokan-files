Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, December 9th: According to TASS, the "Hands Off China Mass Conference" sponsored by the American Democratic Far East Policy Committee opened in New York on the 5th. Participants demanded that the U.S. government cease all aid to Chiang Kai-shek, withdraw all American military personnel stationed in China, and allow the Chinese people to establish their own government. All speakers at the meeting emphasized that the U.S. government has spent as much as six billion U.S. dollars to help the Chiang regime conduct its civil war. Zhu Tong (i.e., Tang Mingzhao mentioned in the December 7th dispatch), editor of the New York Chinese Journal, denounced the new conspiracy of American reactionaries to continue prolonging the Chinese civil war. Radio commentator Walsh (erroneously referred to as Monde Walsh Radio in the December 7th dispatch) said in his speech, "I pay the greatest respect to the Chinese Communist Party, which leads the Chinese people in building a democratic society."
