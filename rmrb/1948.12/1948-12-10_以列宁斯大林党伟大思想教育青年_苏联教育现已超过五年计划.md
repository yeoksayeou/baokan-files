　　Educating Youth with the Great Ideas of Lenin and Stalin
  　Soviet Education Now Exceeds the Five-Year Plan
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 7th: Soviet education has developed rapidly since the war, and now exceeds the goals of the post-war Five-Year Plan. This year, there are nearly 198,000 primary and secondary schools opening, with 1.25 million teachers and a total of 32 million students (approximately one-sixth of the Soviet Union's total population). Many secondary school graduates continue to receive higher education. The Soviet Union currently has more than 800 institutions of higher education, with 20 newly opened this year alone. The number of students in institutions of higher education has exceeded 700,000, and including students in correspondence courses, it exceeds 1 million. For young people who have not received secondary education for various reasons, there are special schools, which are schools for working youth in cities and schools for rural youth in the countryside. This year, the total number of male and female students in these schools is more than 800,000. In addition, there are labor training schools for training workers in various industries such as lathe operation, assembly, electrical engineering, construction, and textiles. In the process of implementing the Five-Year Plan, a total of 4.5 million students will graduate from labor training schools, becoming excellent technical workers. After receiving secondary and higher education, many people in the Soviet Union can continue to study. This year, a total of 100,000 people are studying at various Marxist-Leninist colleges, including many professors, engineers, doctors, agriculturalists, and actors.
    Pravda, in discussing Soviet education, pointed out: Soviet schools educate young men and women in the spirit of the great ideas of the Lenin and Stalin party, with the aim of not only training excellent experts and specialists, but also cultivating well-educated citizens, so that they become cultured and conscious builders of communist society, actively engaged in the construction of communist society.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 7th: TASS reports: The Soviet Higher Correspondence School has a total of 270,000 students, of which 100,000 are enrolled this year. In fact, all colleges and universities across the country have correspondence departments. There is no profession that cannot be learned in a correspondence school. For example, the curriculum of the Moscow Metal Industry Correspondence School includes mechanics, machine manufacturing, automobiles, tractors, and hot metalworking. Thousands of excellent engineers have graduated from the school without ever stopping their work. This year, the Leningrad Institute of Technology enrolled 1,150 students. The All-Soviet Textile and Light Industry Correspondence School will enroll nearly 1,000 freshmen this fall, many of whom are ordinary workers. Tens of thousands of teachers, agricultural and industrial workers are studying at higher normal, agricultural, and industrial correspondence schools while working.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 7th: TASS reports: The Presidium of the Soviet Academy of Sciences discussed the training of new scientific personnel at a meeting. Currently, more than 1,500 young specialists are working in the institutes, laboratories, research stations, and branches of the Academy of Sciences under the guidance of famous scientists, and they are future masters and doctors in the scientific community. They include representatives of 52 ethnic groups, many of whom are young men and women from Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan, and other republics, where the vast majority of people were illiterate during the Tsarist era. They are now studying various issues related to science and the national economy. For example, young scientists in Tajikistan are studying linguistics, literature, and the history of the various multi-ethnic republics, while scientists in the southern republics are studying drought resistance and the cultivation of drought-resistant plants, and scientists in the far north are studying the development of agriculture in the northern regions. In 1949, the Academy of Sciences will supply 400 young experts with scientific degrees to research institutes across the country.

　　以列宁斯大林党伟大思想教育青年
  　苏联教育现已超过五年计划
    【新华社陕北七日电】苏联教育在战后发展迅速，现已超过战后五年计划的目标。今年开学的小学和中学将近十九万八千所，教师一百二十五万人，学生总数达三千二百万人（约占苏联总人口六分之一）。许多中学生毕业以后，都继续受高等教育。苏联现有专科以上学校八百多个，今年一年就新开办了二十个。专科以上学校学生已超过七十万人，加上函授课程的学生在内，则超过一百万人。对于因故未能受中等教育的青年，设有专门学校，在城市里是劳动青年学校，在乡村里是农村青年学校，今年，这些学校男女学生的总数在八十万人以上。此外，还有训练车工、装配、电气、建筑、纺织等各业工人的劳工训练学校，在实现五年计划的过程中，劳工训练学校将共有四百五十万学生毕业，成为优秀的技术工人。苏联人民在受了中等教育和高等教育以后，许多人还可以继续学习。今年，在各个马列主义专科大学学习的共有十万人，其中包括许多教授、工程师、医生、农业家和演员等。
    真理报在论苏联的教育时指出：苏联的学校以列宁斯大林党伟大思想的精神教育男女青年，其目的不仅在于训练优秀的专家和专门人材，也在于培养受良好教育的公民，使他们成为有教养的、自觉的共产主义社会的缔造者，积极从事共产主义社会的建设。
    【新华社陕北七日电】塔斯社讯：苏联高级函授学校共有学生二十七万之多，其中有十万是在今年报名入学的。全国各专科以上学校实际上都设有函授部。没有什么职业是不能在函授学校学会的。例如莫斯科金属工业函授学校的课程，就有机械科、机器制造科、汽车、拖拉机和热金属工作科，成千优秀的工程师从该校毕业，而并没有停止过他们的工作。列宁格勒工业，授学校今年有一千一百五十名学生入学。全苏纺织和轻工业函授学校今年秋天招收大学一年级新生将近一千人，其中很多是普通工人。数以万计的教员、农业和工业中的工作人员，他们一方面工作，一方面在高等师范、农业和工业函授学校中学习。
    【新华社陕北七日电】塔斯社讯：苏联科学院主席团在某次会议上讨论了训练新的科学人材的问题。目前，有一千五百多个青年专修人员，在著名科学家的教导下，在科学院各研究所、实验室、研究站和各地科学院分院工作，他们是未来的科学界硕士和博士。他们中间包括五十二种民族的代表，有许多是塔吉克、土库曼、哈萨克及其他共和国的男女青年，这些共和国的绝大多数人民，在沙皇统治时代都是文盲。他们现在研究的是有关科学和国民经济的各种问题。例如塔吉克斯坦的青年科学家，正在研究语言学、文学以及各该多民族共和国的历史，南部各共和国的科学家正在研究抗旱和抗旱植物的种植等问题，极北部的科学家是研究在北部地区发展农业的问题等。科学院将在一九四九年供给全国各研究院四百名有科学学位的青年专家。
