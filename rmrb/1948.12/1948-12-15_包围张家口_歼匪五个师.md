A great battle is unfolding west of Beiping. Our army is attacking the Ping-Zhang Line, with our main forces surrounding Zhangjiakou and Xinbao'an. The bandit Fu is scrambling to resist, but we are beating them into a chaotic retreat. No matter how they run, they cannot escape. Five entire divisions have already been annihilated. The Ping-Zhang section of the Ping-Sui Railway is now entirely under our control. Our army is advancing victoriously, determined to completely eliminate the bandit Fu! Victory also depends on our support. Good men, quickly advance to the front lines!
