Xinhua News Agency, Huaihai Front, 18th. After the powerful offensive of the People's Liberation Army's Huaihai Campaign was launched, the Chiang bandit gang in Xuzhou fell into panic and chaos. On November 22nd, after the Chiang bandit Huang Botao's army was annihilated in the Nianzhuang area, the Xuzhou Kuomintang Party Department, in order to cover up the defeat, ordered newspapers to publish extra editions, fabricating a so-called "Major Victory in the Battle of Xuzhou," and forced citizens to hang lanterns, display colors, set off firecrackers, and collect "comfort items" to celebrate the "victory." However, at the same time, the news of the complete annihilation of Huang's army secretly spread throughout the city. The Chiang bandit Li Mi's army stationed in Damaio in the eastern suburbs of Xuzhou saw a large number of wounded Chiang bandit Huang's soldiers returning to Xuzhou and asked, "Isn't it a great victory on our side?" The wounded soldiers immediately cursed, "Damn it, what a great victory, it's all over. No one cares about our injuries. Fortunately, they (referring to the People's Liberation Army) gave us medicine." This shattered the myth of the "great victory." Then came the news that the Chiang bandit Huang Wei's army was surrounded in Nanpingji, and the morale was even more panicked. The streets were full of Chiang bandit military trucks and bandit officials' cars shuttling back and forth. Citizens refused to use Chiang currency, and prices soared. Chinese cabbage rose from four jiao and one fen of gold yuan to four yuan per jin. From the 26th, no grain could be bought in the city. Only one water shop on the entire Bazi Street was open. The whole city was closed, and only bandit soldiers and bandit officials were selling stolen clothes and stealing warehouse materials on the streets, preparing to escape. On the 29th, the Joint Logistics Headquarters also auctioned off the white flour in the warehouse, and finally fled before they had time to collect the money. At this time, news came that the Chiang bandit Li and Liu armies had been defeated south of Guzhen and were fleeing south, and the city became even more panicked. Many bandit officials changed into soldiers' uniforms, and military uniforms and caps were thrown everywhere on the roadside. The Chiang bandits also carried out large-scale vehicle and porter grabs in the city, and thousands of male and female students were kidnapped from Tongshan Middle School, Xuzhou Normal School, and other schools alone. Sun Zhuchuan, who set up a stall on Yingshi Street, was grabbed on the road and forced to change into a military uniform. A woman surnamed Du from Bashan, Haizhou, who came to Xuzhou to look for her husband, was also robbed. Many wounded soldiers blocked the road and wailed to the military trucks, "Please be kind and give me a ride!" They were all dispersed by the trucks, and sat on the ground cursing. On the 30th, Chiang's planes bombed Xuzhou's airport and railway station, and the bandit soldiers took the opportunity to loot shops and residents. That night, the Xuzhou bandit army units and organs only received a simple notice to "retreat to Chuxian via Xiaoxian and Yongcheng" and hurriedly set off. There was no division of retreat areas, retreat routes, or marching order. Some didn't even know where Chuxian was. The Xuzhou "Suppression Headquarters" took the lead in setting off. Many troops ran away as soon as they were assembled. The "Suppression Headquarters" officer training team originally had thirteen teams, but only four teams arrived when they gathered outside the West Gate of Xuzhou, and they ran away without anyone commanding them. The "Suppression Headquarters" directly affiliated officer reception team and the garrison of the bandit 8th Army's 711th Regiment were abandoned. Wang Changhai, the commander of the bandit 77th Army, gathered his engineer battalion, communications battalion, and special service battalion stationed in Xuzhou, and said two nonsensical sentences, "Hurry up and go! Hurry up and go!" After speaking, he jumped into a car. On the road and in the fields from Xuzhou to the southwest, people and horses fell, and cries and curses were in a mess. Officers could not find soldiers, and soldiers could not find officers. When the wounded soldiers of the 100th Army and the 74th Army woke up the next morning, they saw that the nurses and orderlies in the hospital were gone. When it was time for meals and they still hadn't returned, they had to get up and limp out to see. They found that the medicines and equipment in the hospital were all empty. They realized that they had already escaped. Now, the lives and medical care of these wounded and sick soldiers are being taken care of by the Xuzhou Military Control Commission of the People's Liberation Army.

　　蒋匪逃窜前的徐州
    匪军官争相逃命叫骂一片商店遭劫学生数千被掳走
    【新华社淮海前线十八日电】解放军强大的淮海战役攻势发动后，徐州蒋匪即陷于恐慌混乱中。十一月二十二日蒋匪黄伯韬兵团于碾庄地区被歼后，徐州国民党党部为掩饰败迹，虽然叫各报馆出号外，捏造所谓“徐州会战大捷”，并勒令市民悬灯结彩，鸣放鞭炮，征收“慰劳品”祝“捷”，但同时全市却暗中流传着黄兵团被全歼的消息。驻守在徐州东郊大庙的匪李弥兵团官兵，亲眼看到大批的匪黄兵团伤兵走回徐州便问道：“不是咱们这边大胜么？”伤兵们接就大骂道：“他妈的还大胜，都完啦，我们受伤没人管，幸亏人家（指解放军）给上了药。”这一下就把这个“大捷”神话给砸破了。接着又传来了匪黄维兵团在南平集被围的消息，兵心更是慌乱，满街是匪军军用大卡车和匪官的小汽车穿梭不停。市民们拒用蒋币，物价暴涨，白菜每斤由金圆券四角一分上涨到四元。二十六日起全市已买不到粮食，整条坝子街，只有一家水馆开门。全城陷入闭市状态，只有匪军匪官们在街上大拍卖抢来的衣物，偷盗仓库物资，准备逃跑。二十九日联勤司令部也拍卖仓库里的白面，最后来不及要钱就逃了。这时，又传来了匪李、刘兵团在固镇以南被打败南逃的消息，全市更加慌乱。许多匪官都换上了士兵服装，军衣军帽乱抛路旁。蒋匪并在城内大肆抓车抓夫，仅铜山中学、徐州师范等校被掳走男女学生达数千人。英士街摆小摊子的孙竹川走在路上被抓起换上军装。海州巴山一杜姓妇女到徐州来寻找丈夫也被抢走。许多伤兵拦路向军用大卡车哀号：“行行好，请带我坐一坐！”都被卡车冲散，坐在地下破口咒骂。三十日蒋机轰炸徐州的飞机场和火车站，匪军们就趁势抢掠商店居民。当晚徐州匪军部队机关只接到一个“经萧县、永城撤退到滁县”的简单通知，就慌忙地出发了，也没有划分撤退区域，撤退路线，行军序列，有的连滁县都还不知道在哪里。徐州“剿总”机关首先带头上路，许多部队刚一集合好，匆匆就跑。“剿总”军官教训队原有十三个队，在徐州西门外集合时只到了四个队，也没有人指挥就跑了。“剿总”直属军官收容队和匪第八军七一一团的留守处都被丢掉不管了。匪七十七军军长王长海把他驻徐州的工兵营、通讯营、特务营集合起来，没头没脑地讲了两句“赶紧走！赶紧走！”说罢，就跳上汽车。从徐州向西南的大路上、田野里，人仰马翻，哭喊声，叫骂声乱成一片。官找不到兵，兵找不到官。一百军和七十四军的伤兵，第二天清晨醒来时，一看医院里的护士与看护兵都不见了，到开饭的时候还不见回来，只得起床一拐一跛的出去看，哪知院内的药品、器材都空了，才发觉是已经逃走了。现在这批伤病员已由解放军徐市军管会照料着他们的生活与医疗。
