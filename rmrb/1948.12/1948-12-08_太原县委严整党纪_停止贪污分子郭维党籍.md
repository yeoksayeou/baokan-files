【Jinzhong Telegram】The Taiyuan County Committee strictly enforces Party discipline.
Guo Wei, a cadre from the Second District of Taiyuan County, was disciplined with suspension of Party membership and removal from his position pending investigation for violating policies, engaging in graft and corruption, and violating Party discipline. Guo Wei is from Liulin Village, Third District, Taiyuan County, and joined the Party in 1944. After the Japanese surrender, he started working. When Taiyuan County was liberated during the Jinzhong Campaign, Guo Wei and his armed work team hid nine large rifles and a radio they had confiscated, and never reported it to the district or county. When the dozen or so members of Guo's armed work team went to work in the Second District, they engaged in graft and corruption and searched prisoners' pockets. According to Guo's own confession, this included a quilt, a piece of oilcloth, a car tire, three silver dollars, four pieces of clothing, 120 catties of salt, 100 catties of wheat, and 60 catties of fancy fabric. Apart from searching prisoners' pockets, these items were also taken from the homes of ordinary people. Not only that, but these dozen or so members of his armed work team were undisciplined in Xiaodianzi, wandering around various shops, buying things without paying, which made the merchants very dissatisfied. After the district leadership discovered Guo's behavior of undermining policies, violating Party discipline, and alienating the masses, they convened a cadre meeting for him to conduct a self-criticism, but Guo showed no sincerity in his self-criticism and was hostile to the leadership. Later, with the participation of the County Committee in continued self-criticism and education, Guo Wei still refused to admit his mistakes. After the meeting, he sent his brother to steal seventy or eighty catties of public salt. In order to overcome this extremely serious act of being unorganized and undisciplined, the County Committee, at an expanded cadre meeting, had everyone expose and criticize Guo's erroneous facts, but Guo Wei still did not undergo a fundamental ideological transformation. Finally, in order to strictly enforce Party discipline, the County Committee decided to suspend Guo Wei's Party membership. He was also given the administrative punishment of removal from his position pending investigation.

　　太原县委严整党纪
  　停止贪污分子郭维党籍
    【晋中电】太原县二区干部郭维，破坏政策，贪污腐化，违犯党纪，受到停止党籍撤职查办的处分。郭维是太原县三区柳林村人，一九四四年参加党；日寇投降后参加工作。晋中战役解放太原县城时，郭维带的武工队，把收缴的九支大枪、一架收音机等隐藏起来，一直没有向区县报告。郭带的十余个武工队员，到二区工作的时候，贪污腐化、搜索俘虏腰包。据郭自己承认的有：被子一条、油布一块、车带一条、白洋三元、衣服四件、盐一百二十斤、麦子一百斤、花料六十斤。这些东西，除搜俘虏腰包而外，还有从老百姓家里拿的。不仅如此，他带的这十几个武工队员，在小店子毫无纪律，到各商家乱窜，买了东西不给钱，商人非常不满。郭这种破坏政策，违犯党纪，脱离群众的行为，经区领导上发觉后，召开干部会检讨，但郭毫无检讨诚意，并且仇视领导。后经县委参加继续检讨教育，郭维仍不肯承认错误。会后却又派他兄弟偷了公家的小盐七八十斤。县委为了克服这种极端严重的无组织、无纪律行为，在扩干会上由大家把郭的错误事实进行了揭露与批评，但郭维仍没基本上的思想转变。最后县委为严格党纪，特决定停止郭维党籍。行政上给以撤职查办处分。
