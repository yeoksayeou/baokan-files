　　Beiyue Fourth Special District
  　Experiences in New Recruit Education and Management
    Strengthening education and management is one of the important tasks for consolidating new soldiers. Leaders must attach great importance to it ideologically. Here are some opinions from the Second District of Fuping, and the counties of Xingtang and Huolu for your reference:
    I. Overcome the idea of simply filling quotas; do not send unqualified personnel. Experience has repeatedly proven that some district and village cadres simply want to complete their tasks. As soon as recruitment is announced or someone has just signed up, they want to send them away quickly, thinking that sending them away means they have completed the task, and that every extra day in the village is an extra day of trouble. In reality, this is the idea of simply filling quotas. We should be responsible to the end, and send recruits only after education and consolidation work; otherwise, there will be more trouble.
    II. Establish branches, cultivate key members, and unite everyone. After centralization, the first thing to do is to establish Party branches, and then discover and cultivate activists based on the usual understanding and the performance of new recruits during their participation in the army. Unite and lead everyone through these activists. In addition, we should also pay attention to the education of young people and inspire their competitive spirit. It is very effective to carry out a competition to consolidate new soldiers among the people in the company.
    III. Use positive education and enthusiastic care to replace passive supervision. Conduct more current affairs education and class education for soldiers to raise their awareness, which is the most basic thing. At the same time, introduce more of the happy life in the army, and be considerate and caring for their hunger, fullness, coldness, and warmth from small living issues such as eating and clothing. Responsible cadres should get closer to them, solicit their opinions, and help them solve their difficulties in order to achieve unity and consolidation. The method of guarding and monitoring cannot solve the problem.
    IV. Educate family members and educate new recruits through family members. At the beginning, Wangkuai Village in Fuping only paid attention to the education of new recruits and ignored the education of family members. As a result, every time a family member visited, the new recruits' thoughts fluctuated. Later, the leaders educated the new recruits on the one hand, and educated the family members of the new recruits on the other hand, and educated and encouraged the new recruits in the company through model family members, which yielded very good results.
    V. Create a wave of enthusiasm for joining the army, and launch consolation activities. In addition to the education of district and village cadres, various occasions should be used to create a craze in the village that joining the army is the most glorious, and mobilize the masses, cadres, and good friends of new recruits to continuously visit the homes of new soldiers to help solve difficulties; on the other hand, continuously send people or write letters to comfort new soldiers (pay attention to waste). If military family members visit new recruits, they should be warmly accommodated and entertained, and the responsible cadres should give them some education. Mobilize military family members to visit as little as possible.
    VI. Carry out cultural and recreational activities and establish various systems. When they are first centralized, the new recruits cannot stand it if they are managed too strictly, and they cannot be managed if they are managed too loosely. Therefore, in management, we should promote democracy more and adopt self-government methods, so that everyone can make agreements, abide by them, and manage each other. In life, in addition to the necessary exercises, we must lead them to engage in cultural and recreational activities (furniture is borrowed by local cadres from counties and districts), so that their lives are always happy and intense. If conditions permit, we can also launch cultural and recreational activities in nearby villages to have a get-together with them.
    VII. Combining praise for the good and criticism for the bad. For models in joining the army and soldiers who perform well after joining the army, they can be praised in a certain occasion to establish a righteous atmosphere; for general mistakes, they should be educated and criticized in a timely manner; for those who repeatedly commit serious mistakes, who do not change after education, and who cannot be reformed, a meeting of new soldiers can be held to struggle against them, expel them from military service, and send them to the government for punishment; if the government can tell the original unit about the punishment, the educational significance will be even greater.

  　新兵教育管理工作的经验
    加强教育管理，是巩固新战士的重要工作之一，领导思想上必须十分重视，兹将阜平二区、行唐、获鹿三县几点意见写出，供大家参考：
    一、克服凑数思想，不合员好不送。几次的经验证明，有些区村干部单纯为了完成任务，一公开出来，或刚报过名，即愿很快送走，他们认为送走就算是完成了任务，在村里多待一天多麻烦一天，实际上是一种凑数思想。我们应该是负责到底，动员或报名之后，经过教育巩固工作再送；否则还会出更多的麻烦。
    二、建立支部，培养骨干，团结大家。集中后，首先应建立党的支部，然后根据平时了解情况，及新兵在参军中的表现，发现和培养积极分子。通过这些积极分子团结和带动大家。另外更应注意到对青年的教育，启发青年的竞胜心，通过人们在连队中开展巩固新战士的竞赛，作用很大。
    三、用积极教育、热情照顾来代替消极的看管。对战士多进行时事教育，与阶级教育，提高觉悟，这是最基本的。但同时要多介绍部队的愉快生活，多从吃饭穿衣等细小的生活问题上，体贴和照顾他们的饥饱冷暖。负责干部多和他们接近，多征求他们的意见，并帮助他们解决困难问题，才能达到团结和巩固的目的。用站岗监视的办法是解决不了问题的。
    四、教育家属，通过家属去教育新兵。阜平王快村一开始光注意了新兵的教育，忽视了家属的教育，结果家属去找一次，新兵思想上起一次波动。后来领导上一方面教育新兵，另一方面又教育新兵家属，并通过模范家属去连队教育和鼓励新兵，结果收效很好。
    五、造成参军热潮，发动慰问慰劳。除区村干部的教育外，应利用各种场合在村里造成参军最光荣的热潮，发动群众、干部、新兵的相好知己，一方面不断的去新战士家中慰问，帮助解决困难；另一方面又不断的派人或者写信去慰问新兵（注意浪费），如果军属去看望新兵，应很热情的给以安置和招待，并由负责干部对其进行一定的教育。动员军属尽量少去看。
    六、开展文化娱乐，建立各种制度。刚集中后，管得严了新兵们受不了，管得松了又没法管理。因此在管理上应多发扬民主，采取自治的办法，让大家订约，大家遵守，大家管理大家。在生活上，除了必要的操课外，一定要领导他们闹文化娱乐（家具由县区地方干部负责借），使他们的生活经常愉快紧张。如果有条件，还可以发动附近村庄的文化娱乐和他们进行联欢。
    七、表扬好的和批评坏的要互相结合。对于参军中的模范和入伍后表现好的战士，可经过一定场合给以表扬，以树立正气；对一般错误，应及时教育批评；对屡犯严重错误，教育不改，确无法改造者，可召开新战士大会斗争后，开除军籍，送政府处分；政府如能将处分情形告诉原部队，则教育意义更大。
