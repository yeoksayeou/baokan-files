    Xinhua News Agency, Ping-Zhang Front, 12th: The powerful People's Liberation Army has launched an offensive along the Beiping-Zhangjiakou line. From the 7th to the 12th, our army has encircled the seven infantry divisions and two cavalry brigades of the Bandit Fu in Zhangjiakou and Xin'an, controlled the entire Ping-Zhang section except for Xin'an, and annihilated two army headquarters, four full divisions, and the majority of one division of the Bandit Fu. When our army recovered Wanquan, Huai'an, and other cities on the outskirts of Zhangjiakou at the end of last month, the Bandit Fu hurriedly transferred two divisions of the 35th Army from Beiping to Zhangjiakou to reinforce them. As soon as the enemy arrived in Zhangjiakou, the Bandit Fu realized that the Ping-Zhang line was under threat and hurriedly ordered them to retreat to Beiping, and sent the 104th Army and the 16th Army from the Nankou area to meet them in succession. At the same time, the Bandit Fu ordered the 271st Division, originally stationed at the isolated point of Xuanhua, to escape to Zhangjiakou quickly to avoid being annihilated. Every one of these plans of the Bandit Fu failed. First, the city of Zhangjiakou was surrounded on all sides. The Yulinpu Airport, more than ten miles southeast of the city, and all the villages outside the urban area have been occupied by our army. The besieged forces in Zhangjiakou include the four divisions of the Bandit Fu's 105th Army, the 258th Division of the 104th Army, and two cavalry brigades. Second, the Bandit Fu's 271st Division, which fled west from Xuanhua to Zhangjiakou, was annihilated in Shalingzi, 30 miles southeast of Zhangjiakou, on the 7th. Xuanhua was liberated on the same day. Third, the two divisions of the 35th Army of the Bandit Fu, who fled east from Zhangjiakou, were surrounded in Xin'an, between Xuanhua and Huailai. Although the two divisions of the 104th Army, which came to meet them from the west, arrived southeast of Xin'an on the 9th and夹击our army with the 35th Army, they were all bravely repelled by our army. Fourth, the 16th Army, which advanced westward from Nankou, except for its advance unit, the 22nd Division (minus one regiment), which had joined the 104th Army, was subjected to pressure from our army after advancing to the Kangzhuang area and retreated southward on the 10th, and was pursued by our army. The entire 16th Army headquarters and its subordinate 109th Division, along with one regiment of the 22nd Division, were caught up southeast of Kangzhuang and were completely annihilated after six hours of battle. Fifth, the 104th Army headquarters and its subordinate 250th Division and 269th Division, attached to the 22nd Division (minus one regiment) of the 16th Army, which failed to meet the 35th Army, fled south again from Huailai on the evening of the 10th and were pursued by our army. Except for more than one regiment of the 269th Division, which was routed and is still being pursued, the rest were completely annihilated in the Shibajia area, 18 miles south of Huailai, at 6:00 a.m. on the 11th. Sixth, the enemy's 94th Army and the remnants of one division of the 16th Army in the Nankou, Badaling, Qinglongqiao, and Changping areas fled in panic on the 11th and 12th and scurried to Beiping. By this time, the entire railway line between Beiping and Zhangjiakou, except for the besieged point of Xin'an, was under the control of our army.

    【新华社平张前线十二日电】强大的解放军向北平至张家口一线发动攻势。自七日至十二日，我军已包围张家口与新保安两处之傅匪七个步兵师和两个骑兵旅，控制除新保安以外的平张段全线，歼灭傅匪两个军部，四个整师和一个师的大部。当我军在上月底收复张家口外围的万全、怀安等城后，傅匪连忙自北平方面调三十五军的两个师至张家口增援。该敌刚到张家口，傅匪发觉平张线已受威胁，又连忙令其向北平回逃，并派出南口方面的一零四军和十六军先后西去接应。与此同时，傅匪又令原驻宣化孤点的二七一师赶快逃往张家口，以免被歼。傅匪的这些计划，每一项都失败了。第一，张家口市是被四面八方包围起来了。市东南十余里的榆林堡飞机场和市区以外的所有村庄，都已被我军占领。被包围在张家口的有傅匪一零五军四个师，一零四军之二五八师及两个骑兵旅。第二，由宣化西逃张家口的傅匪二七一师，七日已在张家口东南三十里沙岭子被歼。宣化于同日解放。第三，由张家口东逃的三十五军两个师，逃到宣化怀来间的新保安地方即被包围。西来接应的一零四军两个师在九日虽已赶到新保安东南，并与三十五军夹击我军，但统被我军英勇击退。第四，由南口西进的十六军，除其先头部队二十二师（缺一个围）已与一零四军会合外，其余进至康庄地区即遭受我军压迫，于十日折向南逃，并被我军跟踪追击。十六军军部及其所属之一零九师全部与廿二师一个团，在康庄东南被追上，经六小时战斗后全部被歼。第五，西去接应三十五军失败的一零四军军部及其所属之二五零师与二六九师，附十六军二十二师（缺一个团），折回怀来复亦于十日黄昏向南逃窜，并被我军跟踪追击，除二六九师一个多团溃逃，正在继续追击外，其余于十一日晨六时被全部歼灭于怀来以南十八家一带地方。第六，南口、八达岭、青龙桥、昌平一带之敌九十四军及十六军残部一个师，于十一、十二两日望风而逃，窜往北平。至此，北平至张家口之间的铁路线上，除被包围的新保安一点外，已全部为我军控制。
