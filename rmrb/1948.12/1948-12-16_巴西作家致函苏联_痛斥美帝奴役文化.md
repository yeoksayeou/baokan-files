　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 14th. TASS dispatch: Brazilian cultural leaders who attended the World Congress of Intellectuals in Defense of Peace held in Wrocław, western Poland, recently jointly wrote to Soviet cultural workers. The letter has been delivered to the Soviet Writers' Union by the famous Brazilian writer Jorge Amado, who is currently visiting the Soviet Union. The letter reads: "When the instigators of war are evilly and shamelessly trying to drive mankind into a new war, we recognize that the responsibility of intellectuals lies in participating in the struggle for peace, democracy, and progress, and opposing the cruel imperialists' conspiracy to enslave all mankind. Our country, especially its national culture, is being threatened by the US imperialist military aggression and enslavement policies. We adhere to the same position as the Soviet Union, the people's democratic countries, and the proletariat of the world. We hail the Soviet Union as a fearless fighter for human peace and happiness. The example of Soviet cultural workers tells us what achievements can be made when culture serves the people's motherland and mankind. On behalf of all Brazilian intellectuals, all the proletariat, and all the people, we pay tribute to Soviet cultural workers, the Soviet people, and their leaders, especially the genius leader of the people, Joseph Stalin." The letter is signed by Shimberg, Freyre, Scliar, Santoro, Castilho, Cicco, Braga, Amado, and others.

  　痛斥美帝奴役文化
    【新华社陕北十四日电】塔斯社讯：曾出席在波兰西部罗克劳城召开的世界文化工作者保卫和平大会的巴西文化界领袖们，顷联名致书苏联文化工作者，该信已由现正访问苏联的巴西名作家乔治·阿梅杜递交与苏联作家联盟。信中写道：“当战争挑拨者罪恶而又无耻地力图将人类驱入新战争时，我们认识到知识分子的责任，在于参加争取和平、民主与进步的斗争，反对残忍的帝国主义者准备奴役全人类的阴谋。我们的国家，特别是它的民族文化，正受着美帝国主义武力侵略和奴役政策的威胁。我们坚守和苏联、各人民民主国家及全世界无产阶级同样的立场。我们向作为争取人类和平与幸福的大无畏战士的苏联欢呼。苏联文化工作者的例子告诉我们：当文化为人民的祖国和人类服务时，会有何等的成就。我们代表巴西全体知识分子、全体无产阶级和全体人民，向苏联文化工作者、苏联人民及其领袖们，特别是人民的天才领袖约瑟夫·斯大林致敬。”署名于这封信上的有什姆贝格、佛利尔、斯克拉、桑托罗、卡斯底尔、西克、布拉加、阿梅杜等。
