Warrior's Poems

During the Taiyuan Campaign, a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army launched a gun-and-poem and battlefield poem writing movement. The warriors' creations expressed their determination to capture Taiyuan and inspired everyone's fighting enthusiasm. A few selections are presented below:

    My plan I'll never forget:
    Join the Party in the Taiyuan campaign,
    Charge forward with strong fighting spirit,
    Capture two Arisaka rifles for keeps.
        (Guo Xiaohan, Liberated Warrior, 12th Company, a certain unit)
  ×          ×          ×          ×
    The People's Liberation Army is a long flowing river,
    Yan Xishan is a stagnant pool of water,
    Knock one down, there's one less,
    Keep fighting all the way into Taiyuan City.
          (Wu Qun, a certain unit)
  ×          ×          ×          ×
    The "Czech" machine gun is Japanese made,
    Improve thinking and skills,
    Cover the attack on the city and blow up the bunkers,
    Achieve merits on the walls of Taiyuan City.
  (Xing Ziming, Squad Leader, 1st Squad, 5th Company, a certain unit)
  ×          ×          ×          ×
    '48 is a year of victory,
    I am determined to fight in Taiyuan.
    My body is strong and robust,
    Carrying explosives to the city walls,
    Not afraid and not flustered,
    The "sweet oil" explosives are fragrant,
    Give them to Yan bandits for a taste.
          (Zhang Qing, Warrior, 8th Squad, 5th Company, a certain unit)
  ×          ×          ×          ×
    My plan is well laid out,
    To send the Yan bandits to the netherworld;
    Continuous explosions are the most glorious,
    The mission must be completed.
    I will not violate battlefield discipline,
    Protect industry and commerce as a model,
    Complete all these plans,
    And make great contributions in taking Taiyuan.
          (He Lishan, Warrior, 8th Squad, 5th Company, a certain unit)

    战士的诗
    人民解放军某部在太原战役中，发起枪杆诗与战场诗写作运动。战士们的创作表现他们攻下太原的决心，更鼓舞起了大家的战斗热情。现选录几首于下：
    我的计划决不忘：
    太原战役要入党，
    冲锋前进斗志强，
    要缴两支三八枪。
        （某部十二连解放战士郭小汉）
  ×          ×          ×          ×
    解放军是长流水，
    阎锡山是死水坑，
    打掉他一个少一个，
    一直打进太原城。
          （某部  吴群）
  ×          ×          ×          ×
    “拐把”机枪日本造，
    思想技术要提高，
    掩护攻城炸碉堡，
    太原城上立功劳。
  （某部五连一班长邢子明）
  ×          ×          ×          ×
    四八年来胜利年，
    我下决心打太原。
    我的身体壮又壮，
    炸药扛在城墙上，
    不害怕来不着慌，
    “油甜”炸药香又香，
    送给阎匪尝一尝。
          （某部五连八班战士张青）
  ×          ×          ×          ×
    我的计划订的好，
    要叫阎匪归阴曹；
    连环爆炸最光荣，
    任务一定要完成。
    战场纪律我不犯，
    保护工商作模范，
    这些计划都完成，
    打开太原立大功。
          （某部五连八班战士何立山）
