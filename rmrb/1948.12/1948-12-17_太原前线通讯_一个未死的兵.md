Taiyuan Frontline Dispatch
  A Soldier Who Didn't Die
    Sikong Gu
    The most intense fighting is over. The artillery is still firing intermittently in the distance.

    At the entrance of the regimental command post, a pile of enemy corpses lay scattered. The wind blew a soft whistle along the bottom of the ditch, like the enemy's soft sigh.

    I came out of the regimental command post, intending to go to the battalion command post. Just as I approached the pile of enemy corpses, Gu Jinming, the propaganda and education chief of the regimental political department, walked towards me. Behind him followed three soldiers carrying shovels and picks.

    "What are you doing!" I asked him casually.

    "Burying the enemy corpses." He shifted his gaze to the enemy corpses, then immediately withdrew it. I couldn't help but glance at the enemy corpses; at the same time, the scene of the enemy's counterattack yesterday floated in my mind.

    Yesterday's enemy counterattack was quite fierce. The enemy had brought in the so-called "lifesaving army" newly airlifted to Taiyuan from Yulin – one regiment of the 247th Regiment of the 83rd Brigade and one battalion of the 248th Regiment. But defending the position was the heroic and tenacious Li Zhaosheng Regiment, which had distinguished itself in the Jinzhong Campaign by capturing Zhao Chengshou alive. The battle started at 11:30 in the morning and lasted until 9:00 in the evening, a full nine and a half hours. In the end, our army had to resort to bayonets to drive the enemy back.

    "Hey! Lifesaving army, didn't save old thief Yan's life, and lost their own lives too!" A soldier holding a pickaxe muttered to himself as he walked towards the enemy corpses.

    "Hey! There's one moving in the dead bodies!" the soldier carrying the pickaxe in the back shouted. Everyone's eyes focused on the enemy corpses. Sure enough, an enemy corpse in a khaki overcoat was crawling forward. Very slowly, very laboriously, gradually supporting his arms on the ground, he raised his head, as if asking for help.

    I walked over and looked at his face. His face was covered with blood and dirt. His face was completely earth-gray, and his hair was also earth-gray. One eye was blocked by blood and dirt, and the other eye flickered with a yellow, pleading light. I looked carefully at his body, and I couldn't find any wounds from top to bottom, only a cut on his left cheek from a bomb.

    "Why didn't he run away yesterday!" I thought to myself. Gu Jinming, however, began to ask him in a generous manner:

    "How are you?"

    "It's okay, I can still live! I can still live!" He didn't seem to understand our policies, fearing that we would bury him along with the dead, and he struggled forward while trembling. His voice was full of fear, pleading, and a desire for life.

    It turned out that this enemy soldier, during the enemy's seventh counterattack yesterday, was driven to the front of our position by the enforcement team. He was wounded by a grenade. Just as he was about to crawl back, he saw Tian Shusheng, the political instructor of our 3rd company, leading two platoons, rushing out of the outer trenches with guns. They immediately shot down more than a dozen enemies, scaring him so much that he lay on the ground and didn't dare to move. After the enemy retreated, he wanted to escape, but it was impossible. So he pretended to be a corpse, stretched out his legs, and lay among the enemy corpses. At that time, the wound on his face was bleeding. He grabbed a handful of soil and blocked it, and the blood slowly congealed. Soon the bleeding stopped.

    He hoped for darkness so he could crawl back to the enemy's position; however, at dusk, our army cleared the battlefield and moved all the enemy corpses on the position down. This was something he didn't expect – the enemy's corpses, not buried by the enemy, would actually be buried by the People's Liberation Army.

    "Good! We will send you to the rear hospital for treatment. Don't be afraid, the People's Liberation Army's policy is lenient." Comrade Gu Jinming said to him in a comforting tone. At the same time, he called a soldier to notify the stretcher squad.

    Two lines of tears suddenly welled up in his eyes, and his arms relaxed, and he lay down again.

    This enemy soldier's name is Cao Zirong, from Xianyang County, Sichuan. He was conscripted two years ago. According to him, this time he was airlifted from Yulin to Taiyuan, and he only started fighting after five or six days. Their soldiers all knew that going to Taiyuan was just a death sentence. They were very strictly supervised and had no way to escape. Our policies were blocked by the bandits, so they had no way of knowing them. Otherwise, he said, they would definitely have defected in large numbers.

　　太原前线通讯
  　一个未死的兵
    司空谷
    最激烈的战斗过去了。炮仍在远处断断续续地响着。
    团指挥所洞口，放了一堆横七竖八的敌尸，风顺着沟底吹着细细的哨音，象敌人轻声的叹息。
    我由团指挥所出来，打算去营指挥所，刚走近敌死尸堆前，团政治处宣教股长谷进明同志迎面走来，他后面跟着三个战士扛着洋锹洋镐。
    “干啥去！”我不经心地问他。
    “埋敌人的死尸。”他把视线移到敌人的尸体上，立刻又收了回来，我不觉也向敌尸看了一眼；同时脑子里又浮动起昨天敌人反扑时的景象。
    昨天敌人的反扑，战斗是相当激烈的。敌人调来了新自榆林空运太原的所谓“救命军”——八十三旅二四七团一个团，及二四八团一个营。但防守的正是我晋中战役活捉赵承绶建功的英勇顽强的李兆升团。战斗自上午十一点半开始，一直到下午九点钟止，整整打了九个半钟头，最后还是我军端起刺刀才把敌人刺退了。
    “嘿！救命军，没救下阎老贼的命，把自己的命也丢了！”拿着洋镐的战士向敌尸那边一边走一边自言自语地说。
    “咿！死尸里面怎么有一个动起来啦！”扛着洋镐走在后面的战士叫了起来。大家都把眼光集中到敌尸上面，果然一个穿黄呢大衣的敌尸在向前爬动。很缓慢，很吃力，渐渐从地面上支撑着胳胳膀，抬起了头，好象求救的样子。
    我走过去，看了看他的脸，脸上粘满了混合着泥土的血污，脸完全是土灰色的，头发也是土灰色的，一只眼睛被血与泥土糊塞住了，另一只眼睛闪动着黄色的乞怜的光。我再仔细看他的身上，从上到下却找不到一处伤痕，只左脸颊被炸弹打伤了一个口。
    “为什么他昨天没有跑掉呢！”我在这样想。谷进明却开始用宽大的态度问他：
    “你怎么样？”
    “不要紧，我还能活！我还能活！”他好象不太了解我们的政策，怕我们把他一道埋了，一面挣扎着向前爬动，一面颤抖地说。声音里面充满了恐惧、企求，与对于生命的渴望。
    原来这个敌兵，在昨天敌人第七次反扑的时候，他被执法队赶到我阵地前沿，遭手榴弹炸伤，正想爬起向回逃，却看见我三连指导员田树圣，带领两个班，端着枪冲出外壕，当场通倒敌人十几个，吓的他伏在地上也就没敢动弹了。敌人退走以后，他想逃跑，已不可能，便装作死尸伸着腿睡在敌人死尸堆中。那时他脸部的伤口正在流血，他用手抓了一把土堵上，血慢慢凝结起来，不久血止住了。
    他盼望着天黑，好爬回敌人阵地去；然而在黄昏的时候，我军清理战场，却把阵地上的敌尸全搬运下来。这使他没有想到，敌人的尸体，敌人不埋，竟会由解放军来掩埋。
    “好！我们把你送到后方医院去医治，不要怕，解放军政策是宽大的。”谷进明同志用安慰的口吻向他说。同时叫了一个战士通知担架排去了。
    他眼上顿时涌出了两眶眼泪，胳膀一松又躺下了。
    这个敌兵名字叫作曹子荣，四川县阳人，前年被抓丁抓出来的。据他说，这次由榆林空运到太原，总共才不过五六天，就开始接触了战斗。他们的士兵大家都知道到了太原就只有送死，他们被监督的很严，也没有办法可以逃跑。我们的政策被匪方封锁了，使他们没法知道，不然的话，他说他们一定大批地跑过来的。
