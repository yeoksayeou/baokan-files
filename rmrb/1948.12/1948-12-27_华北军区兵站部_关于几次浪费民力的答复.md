　　North China Military Region Logistics Department
  　Reply Regarding Several Instances of Wasting Civilian Labor
    After reading Comrade Fu Min's article "Wasting Civilian Labor, Public Dissatisfaction, the Logistics Department Should Conduct a Self-Criticism" in the "Criticism and Suggestions" section of the December 7th People's Daily, we promptly conducted a thorough investigation of the materials published in the article, preparing to present the materials to your newspaper. Subsequently, on the December 16th newspaper, we also saw Comrade Zhang Ziliang and Zhang Zhifeng's manuscript "Wasting Civilian Labor is Also Bureaucracy." Therefore, we have unified our understanding of these materials and are now sending the Logistics Department's response (which we have reviewed) regarding several instances of civilian labor waste to your newspaper, hoping that it will be published.
    We believe that the spirit of the manuscripts written by Comrades Fu Min, Zhang Ziliang, and Zhang Zhifeng is very good because it concerns the issue of responsibility to the people. This kind of enormous waste of civilian labor caused by a lack of precision and organization in work is intolerable to anyone and must never be allowed to happen again in the future. The occurrence of these matters should draw the attention of every comrade participating in logistics work, as it is not merely a matter of work style but a matter of one's position of whether or not one is responsible to the people. Although the above three comrades were not entirely clear about the responsible parties for these matters in their submissions, we cannot emphasize these points today.
    Based on the report from the Transportation Section and the results of our personal investigation, the Logistics Department should bear some responsibility for these instances of civilian labor waste due to imprecise procedures. However, we believe that the primary responsibility should be borne by the Supply Department and the Fourth Military Sub-district's Armed Forces Department. We hope that the relevant units mentioned above will conduct a self-criticism and also provide any comments on the Transportation Section's report. In general, these incidents serve as a valuable practical lesson for the Logistics Department personnel (especially those directly involved in mobilization work). It points out to us that in future work, we must redouble our work ethic, avoid causing unnecessary losses to the people in supporting the front, and better fulfill the task of supporting the front.

### 华北军区兵站部　关于几次浪费民力的答复

专栏：检讨与答复

　　华北军区兵站部
  　关于几次浪费民力的答复
    我们读了十二月七日人民日报“批评与建议”复民同志所写：“浪费民力，群众不满，兵站部应作检讨”一文以后，即将该文内所刊载材料作确切的调查，准备将材料介绍贵报。接着于十二月十六日的报上，又见了张子良、张稚枫二同志所写“浪费民力亦是官僚主义”一稿，故我们遂将这几个材料作统一的了解，现将本部运输处的关于几次民力浪费的答复（我们已审阅）寄给贵报，希予刊登为盼。
    我们认为复民、张子良、张稚枫三同志所写稿子的精神是很好的，因为这是对人民负责的问题，这种由于工作缺乏精确性和组织性而引起的庞大民力的浪费，是任何人所不能容忍的，并且今后亦是绝不允许再发生的。这几件事情的发生，应引起每一个参加后勤工作的同志注意，因这不仅是工作作风的问题，而是对人民负责与否的立场问题。虽然上面三同志在问题的提出，对这几件事情的责任者调查的不太清楚，但是我们今天不能强调这些。
    那么根据运输处的报告及我们亲自调查的结果，这几次民力的浪费，兵站部由于手续的不精确是应当负一部分责任，但是主要责任我们认为应由供给部及四分区武装部负责，并且希望以上有关单位作个检讨，并对运输处的报告有何意见亦请提出。总的讲来，这几次事情对兵站人员来讲是个很好的实际教训（特别是直接参加动员工作的兵站人员），它向我们指出：在今后的工作中，要百倍的加强工作责任心，避免在支前工作中使人民受到不必要的损失，更好的完成支前任务。
