　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 6th. The Qiongya Column of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (its predecessor was the Qiongya Red Army), which has a glorious history of more than 20 years of struggle, has suffered countless attacks from the Kuomintang bandit gang's army (the 46th Army of Han Liancheng), three security corps (after the 46th Army was transferred north in the winter of 1946, it had increased to six security corps) and reactionary armed forces belonging to various county governments since the Japanese surrender. Under the leadership of Comrade Feng Baiju, leader of the Qiongya Communist Party, the Qiongya Column finally smashed the Kuomintang bandit army's successive "encirclements and suppressions" and "sweeps," weakened the enemy, developed itself, established guerrilla base areas, and launched people's guerrilla warfare throughout Qiongya, creating a new situation in the Qiongya people's liberation movement. From January 1947 to July 1948, in the year and seven months, according to incomplete statistics, the Qiongya Column fought hundreds of large and small battles with the Kuomintang bandit army and reactionary armed forces in various counties, killing and wounding more than 3,650 enemy personnel, including Chen Ruizhang, the commander of the 6th Security Corps (killed), Zeng Jie, the commander of the Western Route and Major General Commander of the 3rd Security Corps (wounded), Han Yunchao, the magistrate of Ledong County (killed), and Lin Daoxiu, the deputy of the Yulin Fortress Military Battalion (killed); captured more than 500 people, including Wang Yanzuo, the magistrate of Ledong County, and Ye Chongjun, the magistrate of Ganen County; and won over dozens of battlefield uprisings. It seized 69 light and heavy machine guns, more than 1,400 long and short guns, more than 120,000 rounds of ammunition, 300 to 400 grenades, and more than ten grenade launchers, submachine guns, and tail guns. Liberated the three county towns of Baoting (southern Qiong Island), Baisha (western Qiong Island), and Ledong (northwestern Qiong Island) and their entire regions surrounding the Wuzhi Mountain (only Xinchangba in Ledong and Shilu in Baisha are still in enemy hands), and once liberated the county town of Yaxian and the county town of Lingao.
　　Simultaneous with the development of military victories, the Qiongya Column implemented measures to improve the people's lives in the areas it had already liberated, such as rent reduction and interest reduction, development of production, and regulation of rations. In the enemy-occupied areas and guerrilla areas, it led and helped the masses resist the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang's atrocities of conscription, grain taxation, tax extraction, and corvée labor, protected the interests of the masses, and won the support of the people of Qiongya.
　　In the face of the victorious advance of the Qiongya People's Liberation Army and the widespread development of guerrilla warfare throughout Qiong Island, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang felt its strength weakening day by day and gradually retreated to coastal areas and urban strongholds. The vast mountainous and rural areas are controlled by the Qiongya Column. The development of the Qiongya People's Liberation War struck at the conspiracy of the Sino-American reactionaries to jointly develop Qiongya and to turn Qiongya into their last stronghold for stubborn resistance after their defeat in mainland China.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 6th. The Kuomintang reactionary rule on Qiongya (Hainan Island) has been extremely weakened under the hammer blows of the Qiongya Column of the People's Liberation Army. In its consultation to the pseudo-Legislative Yuan on the so-called "Hainan Island Province Change" issue on the 3rd of this month, the pseudo-Executive Yuan admitted that the Kuomintang could not "ensure" "security" on the island, and that government orders could not be implemented. "At present, the only places that can be reached on the island are Haikou in the north and Yulin in the south." According to the Hong Kong Ta Kung Pao on October 31 and the Peiping World Daily on November 6, the Haikou Kuomintang Army Repair Shop was recently attacked by the Qiongya Column, and the defending enemy in Yulin Port also felt threatened. A company and a small police team of the Kuomintang army near Qiongxi have surrendered to the Qiongya Column.

### 琼崖我军胜利进军  控制全岛广大地区　蒋匪统治被迫退缩沿海

　　琼崖我军胜利进军  控制全岛广大地区
  　蒋匪统治被迫退缩沿海
    【新华社陕北六日电】已有二十多年光荣斗争历史的中国人民解放军琼崖纵队（它的前身为琼崖红军），自日本投降以来，即遭受国民党匪帮一个军（韩练成的四十六军）三个保安总队（一九四六年冬四十六军北调后，曾增加到六个保安总队）及各县政府所属反动武装的无数次进攻。琼纵在琼崖共产党领袖冯白驹同志领导下，终于粉碎了国民党匪军的历次“清剿”和“扫荡”，并削弱了敌人，发展了自己，建立了游击根据地和开展了全琼崖各地的人民游击战争，创造了琼崖人民解放运动的新局面。从一九四七年一月到一九四八年七月的一年零七个月当中，据不完全的材料统计，琼纵曾与国民党匪军与各县反动武装大小战斗数百次，毙伤敌保安第六总队长陈瑞章（毙），西路指挥官兼保安第三总队少将总队长曾杰（伤），乐东县长韩云超（毙），榆林要塞军大队副林导秀（毙）等以下三千六百五十多名；俘乐东县长王衍祚，感恩县长叶崇峻等以下五百余名；争取战场起义数十名。缴获轻重机枪六十九挺，长短枪一千四百余支，子弹十二万余发，手榴弹三四百枚，掷弹筒，冲锋枪，枪尾炮等十余门。解放五指山周围的保亭（琼岛南部）、白沙（琼岛西部）、乐东（琼岛西北）三座县城及其全部地区（只乐东的新厂坝，白沙的石碌仍在敌手），并曾一度解放崖县县城及临高县城。
    与军事胜利发展同时，琼纵在已经解放了的地区，进行了减租减息，发展生产，调剂口粮等各项改善人民生活的措施，在敌占区及游击区，领导与帮助群众反抗蒋匪帮的抽丁、纳粮、抽税、劳役等暴政，保障群众利益，深得全琼人民拥护。
    在琼崖人民解放军胜利进军与全琼游击战广泛发展面前，蒋匪帮自感力量日弱，逐渐退缩到沿海地区及城市据点内。广大的山地与农村为琼纵所控制。琼崖人民解放战争的发展，打击了中美反动派合力开发琼崖，并拟把琼崖变为他们在中国本部败退后负与顽抗的最后据点之阴谋。
    【新华社陕北六日电】琼崖（海南岛）国民党反动统治在人民解放军琼崖纵队的锤击下，已极度削弱。伪行政院本月三日给伪立法院的关于所谓“海南岛改省”问题的咨文中，承认国民党在该岛“治安”无法“确保”，政令无法推行，“目前岛上可到之处，北面仅一海口，南面仅一榆林”。据十月三十一日香港大公报及十一月六日北平世界日报披露：海口国民党军修械所最近曾受到琼崖纵队的袭击，榆林港守敌亦感受威胁。琼西附近国民党军一连及警察一小队已向琼崖纵队投诚。
