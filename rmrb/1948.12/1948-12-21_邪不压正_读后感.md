Reading Notes on "Evil Cannot Suppress Good"
    Dang Ziqiang

    The People's Daily has continuously published the novel "Evil Cannot Suppress Good" written by Comrade Zhao Shuli. Comrade Zhao Shuli is a representative writer of the new direction of literature and art, and his works have played a significant role in promoting new literature and art. I have always read Comrade Shuli's works in one go, and this one was no exception. After reading it, I have some thoughts that I would like to write down for joint study.

    The protagonist of the novel is Ruan Ying, a woman liberated from dark rule. Generally speaking, she has typical significance. However, I believe there are shortcomings in writing about this protagonist. The character Ruan Ying is written as having a very tenacious personality, always fighting with unwavering determination. Such stubborn people as Ruan Ying do exist in rural areas. However, the character's personality must be organically linked to the evolution and change of the objective environment. A seventeen-year-old girl, under the rule of the old forces, although having a strong demand for freedom of marriage, could not possibly be unaffected by the old society. A more realistic form of expression should be hope, struggle, wavering, hesitation, and finally determination. The process from hope to determination is a process of change, and it is tortuous because society is changing. Ruan Ying in the novel did not go through this process of change. In this way, Ruan Ying's ideological determination, and even her unwavering struggle in action, seems unmotivated and not very realistic. Her determination should be largely in sync with the changes in the objective environment. The Communist Party came and brought liberation. The Party promoted society, and of course, it also promoted Ruan Ying. Ruan Ying's firm ideology should have been produced under the direct or indirect education and cultivation of the Party. Of course, Comrade Shuli did not write Ruan Ying in the old era and Ruan Ying in the new era as exactly the same. Ruan Ying in the old era succumbed to the evil forces crying, but Ruan Ying after liberation could not suddenly become so open-minded in her thinking and so determined in her fighting spirit. What I am saying is that the process of change was not written out, especially in the Ruan Ying after liberation. The impression given by Comrade Shuli's writing is that Ruan Ying's determination can only be explained by her innate nature, as if it has little or no relationship with the development of society. This is not in line with the objective laws of development (including both social and Ruan Ying's personal thoughts), which is a major flaw. Secondly, technically speaking, due to Ruan Ying's determination, there are not many waves and twists, which reduces the interest of the story. After reading the first paragraph, we feel very relieved about Ruan Ying's marriage, because Ruan Ying's outstanding personality has already given us a color sample. Here, the artistry is poor, and the attraction to the reader is also affected.

    In the third paragraph, when Anfa led Xiao Dan to propose marriage to Ruan Ying, Jucai was furious when he heard it, cursing "bullshit," and flew into a rage. At this time, Ruan Ying calmly played a trick, pretending to agree, saying: "I'm so old, it doesn't matter if I just settle down!" Here, whether the means adopted by Ruan Ying—attempting to go back on her word at the last moment—is appropriate for this typical "righteous" character is debatable. What is even stranger is that Ruan Ying did not communicate with her parents beforehand. Ruan Ying's disguise will surprise Jucai because he was not prepared for it. His own daughter suddenly changed, going against her parents' wishes, especially against her own long-held ambitions. Jucai would be surprised or even angry. However, Jucai in the novel did not speak at this time, but only asked a question after Xiao Dan and Anfa left, and Ruan Ying's answer was: "Let's take it one step at a time!" How vague! This also seems not very reasonable.

    Xiao Bao is Ruan Ying's love interest and also the main character on the "righteous" side. His position in the novel should be second only to Ruan Ying. In the article, Xiao Bao's activities are really written too little and very weakly. At the struggle meeting, Xiao Bao was originally wronged, but Xiao Bao did not dare to defend himself. The successive blows of "not letting him drive mules for the cooperative," "not giving him fruit this time," and someone saying "he can no longer be considered an activist" cannot be said to be not severe. However, Xiao Bao is always on the defensive, without any rebuttal. Xiao Bao, who had been "doing odd jobs at the Liu family's house" since he was a child, "could drive two pack mules for the Liu family at the age of eighteen," and who is also a Communist Party member, silently sulks and does not dare to stand up and fight after people have deprived him of his economic interests, especially his political status. This kind of writing is not only insufficient to express Xiao Bao's "righteousness," but also does not match Ruan Ying's character. Xiao Bao should be an excellent Communist Party member, and he should have backbone.

    Xiao Dan is the "evil" protagonist, a hooligan lackey and speculator. He actually became an activist and held the position for a long time. He has no mass support at all. His prestige is a castle in the air: "In Xiahe Village, everyone knows your bones!" If so, how did he become an activist? Branch Secretary Yuan Hai is consistently correct, so how can he get along with Xiao Dan? The masses have clear eyes, so how do the masses discuss Xiao Dan's being an activist? Very little is written. The masses have not had any influence on Xiao Dan for a long time. On this point, I believe that the role of the Party and the masses is written with too little weight.

    Exposing darkness should expose the roots of darkness. In rural areas, feudal landlords are of course the roots of darkness. Comrade Shuli did not write about the resistance of feudal landlords in the mass movement (we have proved in the land reform work that the active or passive resistance of landlords is inevitable after being attacked. They will never surrender to the masses after one blow), but "they kept twenty acres of self-cultivated land at home" and "Liu Zhong and his son have learned to farm and participated in production in recent years," as if they really "cannot be considered feudal." The way Liu Zhong, a landlord, obediently "participated in production" and the way the lackey Xiao Dan is written as being more powerful than a "dog" are worth considering from the perspective of material selection.

    Let me reiterate that the overall shortcoming of the entire novel is that it neglects the decisive role played by the Party in various aspects of change in rural areas and neglects the organic connection between a person's personality and the objective environment. Therefore, the Communist Party on paper is a Communist Party that is divorced from reality, the Ruan Ying on paper is a Ruan Ying that is divorced from reality, and the feudal landlord on paper is a feudal landlord that is divorced from reality. Therefore, reading this novel is almost like reading a "Jingu Qiguan," and it does not have enough educational significance for readers.

    Finally, I must add that Comrade Zhao Shuli's advantages in writing style, such as being simple and fluent, and skillfully using popular language, are beyond doubt.

    After I finished writing this article, I circulated it in the group. There were no major disagreements on the points raised, but some expressed "not necessarily perfect" and asked if I was "confident" and asked me to "consider it more." This kind of enthusiastic concern is naturally reasonable for me. "A single gain from a thousand thoughts" may not be correct. I am indeed not confident. Comrade Zhao Shuli has an extremely wide readership, and I hope to receive criticism and correction of this article, especially sincerely hoping for Comrade Shuli's advice!

### “邪不压正”读后感
党自强

专栏：

　　“邪不压正”读后感
    党自强
    人民日报上连续登载了赵树理同志写的“邪不压正”一篇小说。赵树理同志是文艺新方向的代表作家，他的作品，在新文艺的推动上，作用是很大的。我对树理同志的作品一向是一口气读完，这篇也不例外。读完后有点感想，愿写在下面，共同研究。
    小说的主人公是软英，她是从黑暗统治下解放出来的一个女性。一般的讲，是有典型意义的。就是在写这一主角上，我认为是有缺点的。人物个软英写成一个性格非常顽强，一直是坚定不屈的斗争着。象软英这种倔强的人，在农村中是存在的。不过，人物个性必须与客观环境的演进变革有机的联系着。一个十七岁的姑娘，在旧势力的统治下，虽然有强烈的婚姻自由要求；同时，也不可能不受到旧社会的影响。比较现实的表现形式，应是由希望、斗争、动摇、犹豫以至坚定。由希望到坚定是一个变化过程，并且是曲折的，原因便是社会在变革着。小说中的软英没有经过这个变化过程。这样软英思想的坚定，以至表现在行动上的不屈斗争，便显得无来由，不大切合现实。她的坚定应该与客观环境的变革大体上合拍。共产党来了得到解放了。党推动了社会，当然也推动了软英。软英的坚定思想应该必须是在党的直接或间接教育培养下产生出来的。当然，树理同志并没有把旧时代的软英和新时代的软英写成完全一样，旧时代的软英是哭泣着向恶势力屈了膝，但解放以后的软英也不可能突然变得思想是那么的豁达，斗志是那么的坚定。我所说的没有写出变化过程来，特别是表现在解放之后的软英。树理同志的写作给人的印象是：软英的坚定，只能在其天赋秉性上得到解释，好象与社会的发展没有关系，或关系不大，这是不合乎客观实际发展规律的（包括社会和软英个人的思想两方面），这是一个重要的缺陷。其次在技术上讲，由于软英的坚定，波浪和曲折不大，使故事也减少了生趣。我们读了头一段，就对软英的婚事感觉很放心了，因为软英突出的性格，已经给我们打了色票。这里艺术性较差，在吸引读者上也受到影响。
    第三段写安发领着小旦给软英说媒的时候，聚才一听怒气冲天，大骂“放他妈的狗屁”，大发了一阵脾气。软英这时却从容不迫的耍了个小手段，伪装应承下了，说：“我已经这么大了，胡沾住个家算了，有什么要紧！”这里，软英所采取的这个手段——企图事到临头再抵赖翻案——对于这个“正”气的典型人物，是否合适还有商量的余地；更奇怪的是：事先软英并没有和她父母打通点子，软英的伪装因为事先聚才没有思想准备，他会感到突然的。自己的女儿蓦地变了，违背了父母的意志，特别违背了她自己的素志，聚才会大吃一惊甚至恼火的，可是小说上的聚才这时却没有说话，只是等小旦、安发走后才问了一问，而软英的答复却又是：“过了一步说一步吧！”多么含混！这里也似乎不大切合情理。
    小宝是软英的恋爱对象，也是“正”这一方面的主要人物，他在小说中占的位置，应仅次于软英，文中把小宝的活动，实在写得太少了，并且很软弱。在斗争会上，小宝本来蒙受了冤枉，小宝也不敢声辩，对“不叫他给合作社赶骡子”，“这次不分给他果实”，还有人说“再不能算积极分子”，一连串的打击不能算不厉害，可是小宝总是处于守势，不加任何驳斥。从小就在“刘家打杂”，“才十八岁就能给刘家赶两个驮骡”出身的小宝，况且又是个共产党员，在人家剥夺了他的经济利益，特别是政治地位之后，消声闷气，不敢挺身斗争，这样写法不仅不足以表达小宝的“正”，且也和软英的性格太不相衬。小宝应该是优秀的共产党员，应该是有骨气的。
    小旦是“邪”主角，流氓狗腿兼投机分子，他居然成了积极分子，而且还当了很长的时间，他是完全没有群众的，他的威信是空中楼阁：“在下河村谁也认得你的骨头！”既然如此，他凭什么当上积极分子？支部书记元孩又是一贯的正确，他怎么能和小旦合得来？群众的眼睛是雪亮的，群众对小旦当积极分子怎样议论？写得很少。群众在小旦身上很长时期没有起任何影响，在这点上，我认为把党和群众的作用，写得分量过少。
    暴露黑暗应当写出黑暗的根子来。在农村里，封建地主当然是黑暗根子，树理同志没有写出封建地主在群运中的抵抗（我们在土改工作中证明：地主在受到打击之后，积极的或消极的反抗是必然的，他决不肯在一次打击之后，就俯首向群众投降），却“家里留了二十来亩自耕地”，“刘忠父子这几年都学会种地，参加了生产”，就好象真的“不能算封建了”一样。刘忠那样的地主服服贴贴的就“参加了生产”，把狗腿小旦写的比“狗”还厉害，从取材上看这样写法也值得考虑的。
    让我重述一遍，通篇小说总的缺点是：把党在农村各方面的变革中所起的决定作用忽视了，把一个人的个性和客观环境的有机联系忽视了，因此，纸上的共产党是脱离现实的共产党，纸上的软英是脱离现实的软英，纸上的封建地主，是脱离现实的封建地主，于是看了这篇小说象似看了一篇“今古奇观”差不多，对读者的教育意义不够大。
    最后还得补充一句：赵树理同志在文笔上的通俗，流畅，运用大众语言的熟练等等各方面的优点，是勿庸赘述的。
    我将这篇文写完以后，曾在小组里传看了一遍，对所提各点均无大异议，可是有的表示“未必尽善”，问我是否“有把握”，要我“多加考虑”。这种热情的担心，对我说来自然是有理由的。“千虑之一得”，所“得”也未必正确。我确是没有把握的。赵树理同志的读者是极其广大的，希望能对本文提出指正，特别殷切的希望树理同志的赐教！
