　　Are Tax Exemptions Deducted for Postal Workers?
    Question: In Wuxiang County, Taihang Second Administrative Office, tax exemptions are not deducted for postal workers this year. The person in charge of the post office said that postal workers are under a "small contracted system" within the supply system. The deputy section chief of the Finance and Grain Section of Wuxiang County Government said that postal workers are on a salary system and should be treated like government couriers, and tax exemptions should not be deducted. I am unclear whether postal workers are on a salary system or a supply system. Should tax exemptions be deducted or not?
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　(Reader Li Wei)
    Answer: Tax exemptions should be deducted from postal workers who are under a supply system, but not for those on a salary system. Generally speaking, most postal workers have now been converted to a salary system, and tax exemptions should not be deducted at their homes. If the salary is very low, equivalent to the supply system, then it is a contracted system within the supply system, and tax exemptions should still be deducted at their homes. Whether or not to deduct tax exemptions should be distinguished based on the treatment system, and should not be compared based on the positions of postal workers and couriers.

　　邮工是否扣除免税点？
    问：太行二专署武乡县，今年征收负担邮局邮工不扣除免征点。邮局负责人说，邮工是供给制内的小包干制，武乡县政府财粮科副科长说，邮局邮工是薪金制，应该和政府通信员一样，不应该扣除免税点。我不明确到底邮局邮工是薪金制还是供给制？该不该扣除免征点？
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（读者  李伟）
    答：邮工是供给制者，应扣除免税点，是薪金制者即不该扣除。一般的说，现在的邮局职工都改为薪金制了，不应该在家再扣除免税点，如薪金很少，相当于供给制者，那是供给制的包干制，还该在其家扣除。扣除免税点与否，应从待遇制度上来分别，不应从邮工和通讯员的职务上来比较才对。（华北政府财政部）
