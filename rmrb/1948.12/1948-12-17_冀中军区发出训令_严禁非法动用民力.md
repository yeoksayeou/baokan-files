[Jizhong Telegram] The Headquarters and Political Department of the Jizhong Military Region issued an order to all units on the 26th of last month to strictly prohibit the illegal use of civilian labor. The order first pointed out that, despite repeated instructions regarding saving civilian labor and strictly prohibiting illegal mobilization, the phenomenon of illegal mobilization of civilian labor and vehicles by our region's troops, local armed forces, rear organs, hospitals, schools, factories, etc., remains very serious today: (1) In combat, without going through logistics distribution, they arbitrarily mobilize extra stretchers, civilian workers, and vehicles. (2) They neither assign capable cadres to lead the allocated stretchers, civilian workers, and vehicles, nor do they take good care of them, but only use them and even scold civilian workers. (3) During troop movements and transfers, they do not conduct good management and education, resulting in many personnel falling behind and arbitrarily mobilizing vehicles. (4) Some personnel on business trips, purchasing missions, and independent actions often use various excuses to arbitrarily mobilize civilian labor and vehicles, caring only about themselves and disregarding human labor. Such illegal mobilization and wasteful behavior not only affect people's production but also directly affect the people's enthusiasm for supporting the war. However, leading organs and leading cadres at all levels have not paid enough attention to such a major issue related to the victory or defeat of the war, and some cadres even adopt an indifferent, oblivious, and accommodating attitude toward it. To correct the above-mentioned bad phenomena, the order specifically stipulates: 1. In this discipline rectification, all units should conduct in-depth education on the issue in the troops and in the rear organs. Whether in leadership or among individuals, when reviewing discipline, this issue must be listed as one of the main contents of the review, so as to achieve a thorough solution and transformation in thought and action. 2. Except for civilian labor, vehicles, and boats required for combat, which will be supplied in full and on time by the logistics department, no other troops, including sub-districts, organs, schools, hospitals, and factories, are allowed to mobilize arbitrarily. If there are special circumstances that require an increase, it must be requested in advance and approved by the brigade or sub-district level organ or higher; otherwise, it will be treated as a violation of discipline. 3. All units should send capable cadres to assist the local cadres accompanying the military civilian workers, stretchers, and vehicles, and should regard it as one of the main contents of the leadership work. 4. In order to prevent arbitrary mobilization, a separate letter will be sent to governments at all levels, stating that from now on, if they encounter illegal mobilization without formal procedures and mobilization certificates, the government and the masses have the right to refuse. If there are illegal acts, their names can be notified to the relevant organs and troops for processing. 5. It is required that leading organs and cadres at all levels pay attention to inspection regularly. If illegal use of civilian labor and vehicles is discovered again, in addition to disciplinary action against the person concerned, the direct leading cadre of the unit must also be held responsible.

　　冀中军区发出训令
  　严禁非法动用民力
    【冀中电】冀中军区司令部、政治部，为严禁非法动用民力现象，特于上月廿六日向各部队发出训令。首先指出：关于节省民力严禁非法动员曾数次训示，但至到今天，我区部队及各地方武装及后方机关，医院、学校、工厂等，非法动员民力、车辆的现象，仍然十分严重：（一）在战斗中不经后勤分配，擅自额外动员担架、民工、车辆等。（二）对所分配之担架、民工、车辆，既不派得力干部带领，不很好进行工作，又不随时加以爱护，而只管使用，甚至打骂民工。（三）在部队行动转移中，不很好进行管理教育，致使不少人员掉队落伍之后，随意动员车辆。（四）某些出差、采购与单独行动人员，常常以种种借口自行动员民力、车辆，只顾自己方面，不惜人力劳力。似此种种违法动员浪费民力之行为，不仅影响人民生产，而且更直接影响人民支援战争的热情。但各级领导机关与领导干部对于这样一个关系战争胜负的重大问题，仍未引起高度注意，甚至某些干部，对此尚采取漠不关心、熟视无睹与迁就放任的态度。为纠正上述不良现象，训令中特规定：一、在此次整顿纪律中，各部应把问题在部队中及后方各机关中进行深入的教育，无论领导上或各个人员中，在检讨纪律时须将这一问题，列为检讨的主要内容之一。从思想上行动上得到彻底的解决与转变。二、除因战斗需要之民力、车辆、船只由后勤部门负责如数及时供应者外，其他任何部队分区在内，机关、学校、医院、工厂不准随意动员，如有特殊情形实须增加时，亦须事先请示，经旅分区以上机关批准，否则即按违犯纪律之行为处理。三、凡所派去之随军民工、担架、车辆等，各部应派得力干部，协助随去之地方干部进行工作，并应视为领导工作的主要内容之一。四、为防止自行动员，另有专函通知各级政府，凡今后遇有无正式手续和动员证而非法动员时，政府和群众均有权力加以拒绝；如有不法举动者，可将其姓名，通知各该机关和部队，进行处理。五、要求各级领导机关及干部，经常注意检查，如再发现非法动用民力、车辆时，除对本人予以纪律处分外，该单位之直接领导干部亦须负责。
