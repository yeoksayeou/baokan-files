　　Managing the company's food well is an important matter related to the health and combat effectiveness of the soldiers. The machine gun company of a certain unit of the Northwest People's Liberation Army has made excellent achievements in this regard, which is worthy of learning by other troops. Under the leadership of Company Commander Wang Jinyu and Instructor Yang Wenbin, coupled with the meticulous planning of Quartermaster Liu Zongsi and the active responsibility of the cooks, they have not eaten raw rice or lacked oil, salt, and vegetables in the past six months, no matter how difficult the environment. On average, each person can eat three catties of meat per month, one and a half catties of vegetables per day, five mace of oil, and five mace of salt. When marching, from the quartermaster and sergeant to the six cooks, in addition to carrying the pot, each person has a carrying pole, often carrying fifty or sixty catties of oil and salt and dozens of catties of vermicelli, eating vermicelli in the complete absence of vegetables. The types and methods of cooking rice are also constantly changing. The quartermaster often studies and plans carefully, and leads by example. Once, they went to a vegetable garden forty or fifty miles away from the unit to buy vegetables, which were fresh and nine-tenths cheaper than in the streets. During the troop consolidation, they organized grinding tofu, sprouting soybeans, and chopping firewood, and used the money saved to buy pigs, cucumbers, lettuce, and cowpeas. They often pay attention to saving food and never throw away leftover rice. The leftover rice after marching is also taken along, and the pot crust and leftover rice are kept for porridge. The remaining noodles and steamed buns are all kept for the next meal. The newly cooked rice is given to the soldiers, and when there is not enough flour, the company headquarters, kitchen, and stable eat millet. From February to May, a total of more than 700 catties of flour, more than 1,200 catties of horse feed, and more than 6,000 catties of grass were saved. They always ensure that there is boiled water to drink and hot water to wash their faces and feet. After drinking enough water during the march, all water bottles and large water bottles for machine guns are filled to ensure that they do not drink raw water on the road. The rice is washed very cleanly, without sand. The kitchen is frequently cleaned, and the cooks' clothes are often changed and washed. Cook Guo Lihua said: "Failure to pay attention to hygiene and increased sick numbers is helping the enemy." In the past six months, the company has improved its food in a planned way, not only without exceeding the budget, but also with savings, and the quality of the food has gradually improved. From the saved funds, they bought tobacco leaves and hemp for the soldiers, partially solving the difficulties of smoking and straw shoes in the company. The whole company praised the food management. The company's cooking class has become a model cooking class, and cook Liu Dajia was selected as the company's special model worker.

　　西北某连管理伙食得法
  　卫生节俭饮食改善
    【新华社西北十六日电】把连队的伙食办好，这是关系战士健康与战斗力的重要问题。西北人民解放军某部机枪连在这方面作出了很好的成绩，值得其他部队学习。该连在连长王金玉，指导员杨文斌领导下，加上事务长刘宗思的细密筹划与炊事员的积极负责，半年来不论在任何困难的环境中，都没有吃过生饭和缺过油盐菜蔬。平均每人每月能吃到三斤肉、每人每天吃到一斤半菜、五钱油和五钱盐。行军时从事务长、上士，到六个炊事员，除背锅以外，每人都有一根扁担，经常挑五六十斤油盐和几十斤粉条，在完全没有菜蔬的情况下，就吃粉条。饭的种类、作法，也经常在变换。事务长经常认真研究筹划，并以身作则。某次他们到离部队四五十里路的菜园子去买菜，又新鲜，又比街上便宜十分之九。部队整训时，组织磨豆腐、生豆芽、打柴，把节省下来的钱买猪、买黄瓜、莴荀、豆角等。经常注意节省粮食，从来没有丢过剩饭，行军时吃不完的饭也带上，锅巴剩饭，留作稀饭。剩下的面条、馍馍都全部留作下顿吃。把新做的饭给战士吃，面不够吃的时候，连部、伙房、马号则吃小米。从二月至五月，共节存面七百余斤，马料一千二百余斤，草六千余斤。经常保证有开水喝，有热水洗脸洗脚，行军时喝够水后，并把所有水壶和机枪用的大水壶都装满，做到路上不喝生水。米淘得很干净，没有沙粒。厨房经常打扫，炊事员衣服常换洗。炊事员郭立华说：“不讲究卫生，增加了病号，就是帮助敌人。”半年来，该连有计划地改善伙食，不仅没超过预算，且有节余，伙食的质量也逐渐提高。并从节余的款项中，给战士买烟叶和麻，部分的解决了连队中吸烟和草鞋的困难。全连同声赞扬伙食管理得好。该连炊事班遂成为模范炊事班，炊事员刘大贾被选为该连特等模范工作者。
