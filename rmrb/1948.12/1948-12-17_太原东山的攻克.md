    The Capture of East Mountain in Taiyuan

    Taiyuan has mountains on both its east and west sides, but the west side has more than ten miles of open area, with the Fen River three miles from the city, too deep to ford. East Mountain, on the other hand, commands a high position, guarding the east of the city and flanking the south and north, so the gain or loss of East Mountain is the main key to the defense and offense of Taiyuan. Its highest peak is Hanshan Mountain, fifty miles east of the city. The entire mountainous area is about thirty miles wide from north to south and sixty miles long from east to west. As early as when the Japanese surrendered, the Yan clique began large-scale construction of fortifications and defenses here. After the battles of Shangdang, Fenxiao, Yuncheng, Zhengtai, and Linfen, the Yan clique reinforced the defenses each time they failed, and appointed Liu Fengbin, former deputy commander-in-chief of the Sixth Army Group, and Cheng Jizong, commander of the engineering division, to be specifically responsible for it. After three years of management, in addition to the original scattered high bunkers, single bunkers, and brick bunkers, new low bunkers, group bunkers, and reinforced concrete bunkers were added. After the Jinzhong Campaign, the Yan clique finally completed permanent and solid defense works with a depth of 60 miles in East Mountain, with its front line reaching the Hanshan area. Each mountain top has a separate stronghold, with three to ten small western-style concrete bunkers surrounded by outer trenches and steep slopes (that is, the left top of the mountain is split into a cliff one to two zhang high). The mountain tops can also provide crossfire, so that every mountain gully and path is under strict fire blockade. Mengjiajing, thirty miles east of the city, is connected by a motor road. Hanshan and the mountain god temple on the east side of Taiyuan City have artillery positions, surrounded by bunkers, which are convenient for stationing troops, launching attacks, and reinforcements. The line of high ground on the western foot of Hanshan is the entire defense line of the near suburbs of Taiyuan. The key fortresses of Niutuozhai and Beihuangjiafen in the northeast of the city, Xiaoyaotou and Naomatou in the east of the city, and Shantou and Shuangchengsi in the southeast surround the city, so it is also called the fortress defense line, only five to ten miles away from the city. The Yan clique boasted that the construction of this project was the best in North China, and boasted all day long about the bunker myth, saying that its more than 2,000 bunkers were enough to resist 500,000 elite soldiers.
    On the night of October 16, our army, with lightning speed, launched a pincer attack from the north and south, and took the core of East Mountain in one fell swoop, capturing the important strongholds of Yulinping northwest of Mengjiajing, Dayotou, Daxiaobeijian to the west, and Shijiaozi, Madigou, and Jiefiawan to the southwest, severely attacking the enemy gathered in Hanshan. More than a thousand members of the Yan clique's "Shame Elimination Struggle Group" were surrounded by our army and had no way to escape. On the 19th, led by regiment commander Li Peiying, they collectively surrendered. Up to this point, the East Mountain positions east of the inner defense line have all been captured by us, and the entire defense system of the Yan clique has begun to fall apart.
    On the 26th, we launched a general attack on the four fortresses of Niutuozhai, Xiaoyaotou, Naoma, and Shantou at the same time. A fierce and sustained battle for the fortresses, which would determine the fate of Taiyuan, unfolded in this area. The Yan clique forced officers and soldiers to resist stubbornly, not allowing them to retreat a step, and those who violated the order would be executed on the spot. In the Naoma position alone, more than 30 people, including the battalion commander, were executed. Every position, bunker, trench, and firing point in each fortress had to be gradually attacked and captured. Every time the Yan clique lost a place, they would force the soldiers to counterattack with a supervising team, up to eight times a day. In emergencies, they would also dispatch tanks and release poison gas to assist in the battle. However, in the face of the brave and tenacious People's Liberation Army, there was no bunker that could not be conquered, and no enemy that could not be annihilated. All the Yan clique's counterattacking troops suffered extremely heavy annihilation blows. Among them, the 40th Division, the 10th Column, and the 8th Column suffered the greatest losses. The 30th Army, which the Yan clique regarded as a "trump card" and often used to block the front, had also suffered more than half of its casualties and was in a state of disrepair. The four battalions of the enemy's 83rd Division took a plane from Yulin, landed at the Fenxi Airport hastily repaired by the Yan clique, and were transported there on the 5th. Before they had a chance to catch their breath, most of them were annihilated by us in Naoma and Shantou. On the 11th, the Yan clique pieced together the crippled 30th Army, the 8th Column, and other units and launched another five consecutive desperate counterattacks. After eight hours of fighting, more than a thousand were killed and wounded by us. Corpses were piled up on the position, and they fled back in defeat. At night, the Yan clique ordered these crippled and even more crippled troops to continue the counterattack the next day. Faced with this emergency, more than 500 officers and soldiers of the 8th Column, in order to survive, launched an uprising under the leadership of Commander Zhao Rui. A battalion of more than 100 men of the 40th Division also successively revolted on the night of the 12th under the leadership of Battalion Commander Wang Dejian.
    In total, in the past half month, the Yan clique's captured and dead or wounded numbered at least more than 20,000. The four fortresses of Niutuozhai, Xiaoyaotou, Naoma, and Shantou, and the entire East Mountain to the east, have all been occupied by us. The dangerous city of Taiyuan has been directly exposed to the powerful attack of our army. The Yan clique's defense system and its bunker myth have been completely shattered. East Mountain, which was once the screen of Taiyuan, has been transformed into the best starting point for our army to attack the city.

　　太原东山的攻克
    前线记者  吴象
    太原东西两面皆山，但西山下尚有十余里开阔地带，距城三里处为汾河，水深不能徒涉。而东山则可居高临下，拱卫城东，侧击城南城北，故东山得失系攻守太原主要关键。其最高峰在城东五十里之罕山，整个山区南北宽约三十里，东西长达六十余里。远在日寇投降时，阎匪即开始在此大规模筑堡设防。后经上党、汾孝、运城、正太、临汾诸役，阎匪每失败一次即增修一次，并指派前第六集团军副总司令刘奉滨及工兵师师长程继宗等专负其责，经营历三年之久，除原有星罗棋布之高碉、单碉、砖碉外，又新添低碉、群碉及钢骨水泥碉。晋中战役后，阎匪在东山已最后完成纵深六十里之永久性强固设防工事，其前沿直抵罕山地区。每个山头有一单独据点，有三至十个小型洋灰碉围于外壕劈坡（即将山之左顶劈成高一丈至二丈绝壁），各山头之间又可交叉射击，使每一山沟小道均在严密火网的封锁之下。城东三十里之孟家井有汽车路连接，罕山与太原城之东侧山神庙有炮兵阵地，周围碉堡林立，便于屯兵、出击及增援。罕山西麓一线高地，则为太原近郊全防线。由城东北之牛驼寨、北黄家坟，城东之小窑头、淖马头，东南之山头、双城寺诸要塞环城，故又称要塞堡垒线，距城均仅五里至十里。阎匪对此工事之构筑自夸为华北第一，并整日吹嘘堡垒神话，谓其二千余碉堡足抵五十万精兵。
    十月十六日夜间我军以迅雷不及掩耳之势，南北钳击，一举插进东山核心，连克孟家井西北之榆林坪，以西之大窑头、大小北尖，西南之石＠子、麻地沟、界花湾等险要据点，痛击猬集罕山之敌。阎匪“雪耻奋斗团”千余人，被我团团包围，无路可逃，十九日在团长李佩膺率领下，集体投降。至此，内防线以东的东山阵地，已悉数被我夺得，阎匪整个防御体系开始支离破碎。
    二十六日我向牛驼寨、小窑头、淖马、山头四要塞同时发动总攻。激烈持续的争夺战，遂展开于此决定太原命运的堡垒地带。阎匪迫令官兵据险顽抗，不准后退一步，违者当场处决。仅淖马之阵地一处遭处决者，即有营长以下三十余人。各要塞之每个阵地、碉堡、壕沟火点，均须逐步激战攻夺。阎匪每失一处，必以督战队逼着士兵反扑，最多者日达八次，紧急时且出动坦克，施放毒气助战。然在英勇顽强的解放军面前，没有不能攻克的堡垒，没有不能消灭的敌人。阎匪所有反扑部队均遭到极沉重的歼灭性的打击。其中以四十师、十总队、八总队等损失最大。被阎匪视为“王牌”常拿来挡前阵的三十军，也已伤亡过半，残败不堪。敌八十三师的四个营，从榆林坐上飞机，在阎匪急急忙忙新修的汾西机场下机，五日刚刚运到，尚未喘过气来，大部分就在淖马、山头被我歼灭。十一日阎匪拚凑残废的三十军、八总队等部再度进行连续五次的绝望反扑，经八小时之战，被我毙伤千余，阵地上遗尸累累，大败逃回。入夜阎匪即下令严逼这些残废又残废的部队翌日继续反扑。其八总队官兵五百余当此紧急关头，为求生路，遂在司令赵瑞率领下举行反正。四十师一个营百余人，亦相继于十二日夜间在营长王德健率领下反正。
    总计半月以来，阎匪被俘与死伤至少在两万人以上。牛驼寨、小窑头、淖马、山头四要寨及其以东整个东山，已全部为我占领。太原危城已直接暴露于我军强大的攻击之前。阎匪的防御体系及其堡垒神话，已被彻底粉碎。曾为太原屏障的东山，已一变而为我军攻城最好的出发地了。
