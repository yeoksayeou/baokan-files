　　Fuping Fahua Village Communist Youth League
    Uniting Youth in Study and Production
    [North Yue News] The Fuping Fahua Village Communist Youth League has united all the village's youth and children to work hard in production, study diligently, and enthusiastically perform their duties, earning praise from the masses. When the League was first organized, it had only seventeen members. Under their exemplary leadership and influence, production, study, and work have all seen considerable improvement. For example, during this year's autumn harvest, they mobilized 250 young people and children from the entire village to participate in production, organizing seven work teams, harvesting autumn crops and planting wheat on over 100 mu of land. The masses said, "These young lads are really accomplishing great things!" In terms of study, driven by the League members, four groups were organized, with a total of fifty-eight men and women; in four months, each person learned an average of more than 140 characters. Their study method involves studying while producing, hiring teachers themselves, helping each other, learning as they go, and leaving once they have learned. During the autumn grain collection, League members not only carried out propaganda but also mobilized their own families to deliver early and deliver good rice. The village completed its public grain quota very quickly, and the Communist Youth League played a significant role. In addition, they demonstrated great enthusiasm in supporting the army. On one occasion, when the People's Liberation Army was stationed in their village, League members automatically carried firewood and water for the army, and female League members Wang Jinchuan and two others baked over two hundred jin of pancakes for the army, while Dong Yuzhen and others made more than thirty quilts for the army.

　　阜平法华村青年团
    团结青年学习生产
    【北岳讯】阜平法华村青年团，团结了全村青年、儿童努力生产、学习，热心工作，获得群众称赞。该团开始组织起来时，只有十七个团员。在他们以身作则带头领导的影响下，生产、学习、工作都起了相当作用。例如在今年秋收中，发动了全村二百五十个青年儿童参加了生产，组织了七个拨工组，收秋种麦一百多亩。群众说：“这群小伙子真顶大事！”学习方面：在团员的带动下，组织了四个小组，男女共五十八人；在四个月中，每人平均识字一百四十多个。他们的学习方法，一面生产一面学习，自聘教员，互相帮助，随到随学，学会就走。在秋征中，团员不但进行了宣传，而且动员自己家早交、交好米。该村公粮做到很快完成，青年团起了很大作用。此外他们在拥军上也表现了十分热情。某次解放军住在他村，团员自动给军队背柴、担水，女团员王金川等三人给军队烙饼二百余斤，董玉珍等给军队做被子三十多条。
