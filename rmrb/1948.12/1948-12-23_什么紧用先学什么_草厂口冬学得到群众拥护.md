　　Learn What's Urgently Needed First
    Caochangkou Winter School Gains Mass Support
    [Reported by Our Newspaper] The emancipated youths of Caochangkou Village, Second District, Fuping, eagerly demanded to learn culture and voluntarily organized a winter school. Sixteen young people formally started classes on October 12th. During the organizational process, the activists, poor peasant youths Li Bingmei and Li Pingde, were discovered. Four of them often went to the elementary school at night. They all felt the pain of being illiterate, especially Li Bingmei, who sold tofu at home and needed to be able to read and write in order to keep track of credit accounts. So they were organized. After the winter school was formed, everyone unanimously requested, "Learn what is urgently needed first." An old man named Li Yinde said, "Teacher, please teach the young fellows to recognize money first." The young man Li Jiede had to transport and sell goods in winter, he said: "Write down what we do outside, each time we return home, please teach us to use the abacus, so we won't make mistakes in buying and selling things, down to the last ounce!" In half a month of learning, they learned at most forty characters. Everyone thought that Li Jiande, who was considered the least capable, also learned to read money and more than twenty characters. Those with a foundation in abacus learned multiplication, and those without a foundation learned addition. Under the influence of everyone's active learning, the number of people gradually increased.
    Every night, strong middle-aged and elderly people often went to the school to watch the young people learning to read. They said: "We peasants have limited vision and don't know the major events of the world. Teacher, please tell us about the Northeast and Taiyuan!" The winter school then decided to focus on culture and supplement it with politics. They explained current events to the farmers and democratically elected a class leader and deputy, established a leave system, and also set out four learning rules: (1) Study with peace of mind, learn more characters, write more, ask more questions, and use them more. (2) No fighting or making noise. (3) Establish a leave system. (4) Everyone should prepare a slate, slate pencil, and white paper notebook for learning. Now everyone has high confidence in learning and unanimously says: "Dripping water wears away the stone, we'll take it slow and steady, and we must achieve a cultural transformation!" (Chen Jihe)

　　什么紧用先学什么
    草厂口冬学得到群众拥护
    【本报讯】阜平二区草厂口村翻身青年，追切要求学习文化，民主自愿的组织了冬学，现已有十六个青年于十月十二日正式上课，在组织过程中，先发现积极分子贫农青年李丙美、李平德等四人，晚上经常到小学去，他们都感到不识字的痛苦，特别是李丙美，家中卖豆腐，很需要识字，才能记赊欠账。就把他们组织起来。冬学组成后大家一致要求“什么当紧用先学什么。”老汉李银德说：“先生你先教小伙们认票子吧。”青年李杰德冬季要运销，他说：“记上俺们跑外的吧，每次回家，请你教俺们打珠算，买卖东西，斤斤两两差不了！”在半月的学习中顶多的学了四十个生字，大家认为最不行的李建德，也学会看票和二十多个生字。珠算有基础的学会乘法，无基础的学会了加法。在大伙积极学习的影响下，人数逐渐增多。
    每天晚上，壮老年常到校里观看学识字的青年们，他们说：“庄稼人眼浅，不知天下大事，先生说说东北太原吧！”冬学便确定以文化为主，政治为副。给农民讲解时事，并民主选举了正副班长，建立请假制度，还定出四条学习规则：（一）安心学习，多学字、多写、多问，多用。（二）不打不闹。（三）建立请假制度。（四）每人准备学习用的石板石笔和白纸本。现在大家学习信心很高，一致说：“软磨硬，慢慢来，非搞个文化大翻身不可！”（陈继和）
