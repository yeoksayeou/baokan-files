A Few Opinions on Comrade Wang Peifa's Problem and Comrade Lan Cun's Reply
Sun Jing
Regarding the two questions raised by Comrade Wang Peifa from Qin County, and Comrade Lan Cun's answers to these questions, I personally have a few different opinions:

First, in studying the question of whether to "restore the civil rights of landlords and rich peasants," both Comrade Wang Peifa and Comrade Lan Cun did not distinguish between landlords and rich peasants, but rather referred to them collectively as "restoring the civil rights of landlords and rich peasants" and "the landlord and rich peasant classes have long changed," etc. Comrade Ren Bishi mentioned in "Several Questions in Land Reform": "We must distinguish between landlords and rich peasants." Land reform only aims to eliminate the feudal exploitation system and adopts an elimination policy only towards the landlord class system. For rich peasants, only the surplus part of their property can be confiscated, and they are not to be eliminated as a class. Currently, we allow the hiring of labor and renting of land under certain conditions, so rich peasants will not be eliminated. Therefore, it is inappropriate to generally state that the "landlord and rich peasant classes have long changed." Similarly, I personally believe that generally proposing to "restore the civil rights of landlords and rich peasants" is also inappropriate. Except for counter-revolutionaries among the rich peasants who have been proven guilty by court judgment and can have their civil rights deprived, the civil rights of general rich peasants should not be deprived. A distinction should be made between them and landlords here.

Second, should the civil rights of landlords be "restored"? I think the term "restore" is inappropriate. In areas where land reform has been completed, the landlord class has been thoroughly eliminated. Even if a landlord's class status has not changed, they are no longer landlords in terms of economic status (of course, we must always pay attention to their revenge and hidden destructive activities). My understanding of the Party's policy is to give some people who have already transitioned to laboring lives and are no longer landlords in economic status a political outlet to encourage them to labor and produce. This does not change the nature of the New Democratic regime. On the contrary, it is still positive for eliminating feudalism and eliminating the landlord class.

Third, Comrade Wang Peifa proposed: "Due to the changes in our policies in recent years, not only have the masses become suspicious, but also our general cadres are also bound hand and foot, afraid of taking responsibility, afraid of making mistakes, so that they also have more or less doubts about the policies of the superiors and cannot grasp the bottom line." I don't know what the policy changes mentioned here refer to? If it is thought that correcting the "leftist" deviations in land reform is a change in policy, this is a misunderstanding. One must understand that our implementation of the central general line, general policy, and various specific policies must be correct, and deviations must be corrected. This will be welcomed by the broad masses. Not only will the middle peasants and industrialists and merchants feel at ease and dare to produce boldly, but the poor peasants, farm laborers, and workers will also think it is reasonable. As long as it is done well, it will harmonize and unite all classes to produce. If the masses are suspicious, it means that the local leading organs have deviations in implementing policies or have not sufficiently publicized policies. Conversely, if deviations are not corrected or policies are not publicized in depth, it will inevitably affect production, affect social order, and become detached from the masses. If it is said that some cadres are therefore bound hand and foot and dare not work, I think the problem still lies with these comrades. They themselves have not studied the policies well and cannot comprehend and grasp the spirit and essence of the policies. Therefore, they lose their direction in their work and feel constrained. However, for these comrades, it is better to be cautious than to mess around regardless of the policies. For comrades who can seriously study the policies and correctly grasp the policies, the clear and specific policies will inevitably make them feel more convenient and more able to boldly let go in their work, and they will never be bound hand and foot. As for what doubts the comrades have about the policies, I think Comrade Peifa should best propose them specifically, and after everyone discusses them, clarify the understanding so that the work can be improved. As for saying, "The Communist Party is good in the big aspects, but the peasants often look at it from some practical problems...," this statement is even more problematic. If it is really as Comrade Peifa said that our Communist Party is only correct in principles and policies, and problems arise as soon as we encounter practical matters, then the basic completion of land reform in our North China Liberated Area, the great victory of the three-year Liberation War, the restoration and development of industrial and agricultural production, and the tremendous achievements in Party rectification and support for the front cannot be explained. It must be affirmed that we have achieved in various works. Our comrades must recognize that is the mainstream, it is a little spray stirred up in the mainstream. We have made mistakes in our work, but we immediately make serious corrections, and in correcting deviations, there may be other deviations, which must also be corrected, just as it is currently proposed that we must prevent the "right" while correcting the "left" in ending land reform. Our comrades do not examine the problem comprehensively, see individual deviations in the work, or hear the reactions of a few of the masses, and follow behind and make a fuss, which is a manifestation of tailism. As Comrade Lan Cun said, it is reducing one's own understanding to the level of the unawakened ordinary people. Therefore, it is suggested that Comrade Peifa should seriously improve his own policy thinking and ideological methods, and clearing up various muddled ideas will benefit both work and personal progress.

### 对王培法同志问题和蓝村同志答复的一点意见

　　对王培法同志问题和蓝村同志答复的一点意见
    孙竞
    对于沁县王培法同志提出的两个问题，和蓝村同志对这些问题的解答，我个人还有几点不同意见：
    一、在研究可否“恢复地主、富农公民权”问题中，王培法同志和蓝村同志对于地主富农都没有加以区别，而是笼统地所谓“恢复地主、富农公民权”“地富阶级早已发生变化”等等。任弼时同志在“土地改革中的几个问题”中讲到：“我们必须把地主与富农分别开来”。土地改革只是要消灭封建剥削制度，只是对地主的阶级制度采取消灭政策，对富农则只能征收其多余部分的财产，而不是当做一个阶级消灭，目前我们允许在一定条件下雇工和出租土地，富农就不会消灭，因之一般地把地富阶级平列地去指明其“早已发生变化”是不恰当的，同样的，一般地提“恢复地主、富农公民权”我个人认为也是不恰当的，富农中除了确有证据的反革命分子经由法庭判决，可以剥夺其公民权外，一般的富农不应剥夺，在这里应与地主有所区别。
    二、是否“恢复”地主公民权呢？我觉得“恢复”提法不妥。在土地改革已经完成的地方，地主阶级已经彻底消灭，地主个人即使成份未变，但他在经济地位上已经不是地主（当然要时刻注意他的报复和隐蔽的破坏活动），我了解的党的政策是给一些已经转入劳动生活在经济地位上已不成为地主的人们以政治出路，以鼓励他们劳动生产，这不是改变新民主主义政权的性质，相反的，对于消灭封建消灭地主阶级还是有积极作用的。
    三、王培法同志提出：“由于近年来我们政策的变动，不但使群众发生怀疑，就是我们一般干部也因此束手束脚，怕负责任，怕犯错误，以致对上级的政策也或多或少有所怀疑，摸不住底。”我不知道这里所说政策的变动所指的是一些什么？假如以为土地改革中的纠正左倾偏向就是政策的变动的话，这是一种误解，不了解我们执行中央总路线总政策及各种具体政策必须是端正的，必须是有偏必纠的，这定为广大群众所欢迎，不但中农和工商业者情绪安定敢于大胆生产，就是贫雇农和工人也认为是合理的，只要做的好，就会使各阶层和谐团结生产。假若群众有怀疑，就是当地领导机关执行政策有偏差或宣传政策不够，相反的，假如有偏不纠或不深入宣传政策，则必然影响生产影响社会秩序并脱离群众。若说因此而使有些干部束手束脚，不敢工作，这一点我觉得问题还在这些同志身上，是他们自己没有好好学习政策，不能领会掌握政策的精神与实质，因之在工作中迷失方向感到拘束，不过，对于这些同志说来，与其不顾政策乱搞一阵，倒不如谨慎一些好，而对能认真学习政策并能正确掌握政策的同志说来，政策规定的明确具体，必然会在工作中感到更方便更能大胆放手，决不会束手束脚。至于同志们对政策有些什么怀疑，我觉得培法同志最好能具体提出，经过大家讨论，把认识明确起来，对工作才能有所改进。至于说“大的方面共产党好，但农民往往要从一些实际问题中看………”这说法更有问题，假如真如培法同志所说，我们共产党只是政策原则对，一遇到实际就出问题，那么我们华北解放区土地改革基本完成，三年解放战争的伟大胜利，工农业生产的恢复发展，以及整党支前等巨大成绩的获得，是无法解释的。必须肯定我们各种工作的成绩，我们的同志一定要认清那是主流，那是主流中所激起的一点浪花。我们的工作中是曾经犯过错误的，但是即就予以严肃的纠正，在纠正偏向中也许还会有另外偏差，这同样也要纠正，正如目前提出的在结束土改中纠左必须防右。我们同志不从全面考察问题，看到了工作中的个别偏差，或者是听到少数群众的反映，也跟在后面大惊小怪，这是尾巴主义的表现，也正如蓝村同志所说的，是把自己的认识降低到不觉悟的老百姓的水准。因之建议培法同志应当认真提高自己的政策思想和思想方法，扫清各种糊涂思想对工作对自己进步都有好处。
