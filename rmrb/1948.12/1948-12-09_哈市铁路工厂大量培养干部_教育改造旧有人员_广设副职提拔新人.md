　　Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 7th: The Harbin Railway Factory has achieved remarkable results in its work of training and promoting new cadres over the past two years. This experience proves that as long as there are correct methods, as long as existing technical and management personnel are conscientiously and systematically educated and transformed, and as long as new cadres are conscientiously and systematically trained and promoted from among workers and staff, the problem of a lack of cadres in the victorious situation can be completely solved.

　　Since the Harbin Railway Factory has been under the management of the People's Government, it has strived to achieve the goal of "producing a large number of railway materials, but also training a large number of railway talents." In the past two years, the factory has trained a total of 47 section chiefs, division chiefs, and branch factory directors, dozens of factory [officials], 21 Party branch secretaries, the director and ministers of the Trade Union, and the directors of its 21 branches, etc. As required by the development of the situation, the factory also transferred 57 new cadres to Shenyang, Jilin and other places, as well as the Ministry of Railways, the Ministry of Military Industry, the Northeast Railway Trade Union, the Political Committee's Finance Committee, the Railway Institute, and other departments to take up work. Although most of the old cadres originally sent by the government to the factory have now been transferred away, all business continues to expand and the work is becoming more standardized. In the next month or two, in addition to planning to equip all section chiefs and factory directors with deputy positions and establish factory management committees and other necessary cadres, the factory also plans to transfer another 20 new cadres to be assigned work by the Ministry of Railways.

　　The methods used by the factory to train and promote new cadres are roughly as follows: (1) Educating and transforming the original technical and management personnel of the factory. (2) Promoting activists from among the workers and staff who have emerged in various production campaigns in the past two years. (3) Promoting them according to their abilities after being educated in schools and training classes. (4) Setting up deputy positions to train them through practical work. Regardless of which method is used to train and promote cadres, the factory leaders have often helped and educated them, such as helping them to make work plans, summarize work, review their thinking, and focusing on using the factory's various cadre meetings and cadre study classes to train and educate them. The factory leaders quickly convey every decision of the higher-level Party committee and important editorials and documents in the Northeast Daily to the cadre classes, and often organize discussions to improve their political level. At present, the main content of cadre education in the factory is how to implement the scientification and enterprise management of the factory. In the factory's production, in addition to the important backbone role played by some old cadres sent by the People's Government, such as grasping policies, educating and organizing workers and staff, and leading the administrative and production work of the entire factory, these new cadres have also played a huge role. The backbone role of old cadres is very important, but due to their small number, unfamiliarity with the situation, and lack of technical experience, it has become a very important and urgent task to vigorously train and promote new cadres who are capable and good at leading production and managing enterprises. Among the newly promoted cadres in the factory, many people have emerged who are serious and responsible in their work and have practical experience in leading production. Among them, the more prominent ones include Zhou Wenkui, the section chief of the factory's work planning section, who not only has the ability to lead production operations, but also is determined to regard railway construction as his lifelong career.

　　The factory still has many shortcomings in training cadres. The main thing is that there is only general education, and there is a lack of specific plans to cultivate cadres according to their different specialties and development directions. Many units in the factory have not yet set up deputy positions, technical night schools have not been fully established, and the education of cadres at the foreman level is also insufficient. These shortcomings are being overcome.

### 哈市铁路工厂大量培养干部　教育改造旧有人员  广设副职提拔新人

　　哈市铁路工厂大量培养干部
  　教育改造旧有人员  广设副职提拔新人
    【新华社哈尔滨七日电】哈尔滨铁路工厂两年多以来的培养提拔新干部工作，已获得卓著成绩。这个经验，证明只要有正确的办法，只要认真地有计划地教育改造旧有的技术和管理人员，认真地有计划地从工人职员中训练提拔新干部，在胜利形势下的干部缺乏的问题，是完全可以解决的。
    哈尔滨铁路工厂自经人民政府管理以来，即以“生产大量铁路物资，也要培养大量铁路人材”为努力的目标。在两年多的过程中，该厂共培养了四十七名科长、股长、分厂长，数十名工厂，二十一个党的支书，职工总会的主任、部长和所属的二十一个分会主任等。随着形势发展的需要，该厂另外还抽调了五十七名新干部到沈阳、吉林等地以及铁道部、军工部、东北铁路总工会、政委会财政委员会、铁路学院等部门去担任工作。现该厂内原来由政府派去的老干部虽已大部调走，但一切业务仍继续扩大，工作亦日趋正规。该厂在今后一两个月内，除拟配齐所有科长厂长的副职及建立工厂管理委员会等所需干部外，还准备再抽调二十名新干部由铁道部分配工作。
    该厂培养和提拔新干部的办法大致有如下四种：（一）教育和改造工厂原有的技术、管理人员。（二）提拔在两年来各种生产运动中涌现的工人职员中的积极分子。（三）经过学校、训练班的教育后，按能力提拔。（四）设副职从实际工作中培养。无论对用哪种办法培养和提拔出来的干部，该厂领导人都曾经常地帮助和教育他们，如帮助他们订工作计划、总结工作、检讨思想，并着重利用厂中的各种干部会议和干部学习课堂等来培养和教育他们。该厂领导人把每一次上级党委的决定及东北日报上的重要社论、文件，很快地传达给干部课堂，并经常组织讨论，以提高他们的政治水平。现在该厂干部教育的主要内容是如何实行工厂管理的科学化、企业化的问题。在该厂生产中，除人民政府派去的部分老干部起了重大的骨干作用，如掌握政策，教育和组织职工，领导全厂的行政和生产等工作外，这批新干部也起了极大作用。老干部的骨干作用是很重要的，但由于他们人数少、情况不熟、技术经验也比较缺乏等，因此，大量培养和提拔有能力的、善于领导生产、管理企业的新干部，就成为一件非常重要而迫切的事情。在该厂新提拔的干部中，已出现了不少工作认真负责，有实际领导生产经验的人材。其中比较特出的如工厂作业计划科科长周文魁等，不但有能力领导生产作业，而且决心把铁路建设当作自己终身的事业。
    该厂在培养干部中，仍有不少缺点。主要地是只有一般的教育，缺少按照干部的不同特长及发展方向而加以培养的具体计划。厂内还有很多单位未设副职，技术夜校未全部办起来，对工长这一级干部的教育亦不够。这些缺点正在克服中。
