　　Japanese Important War Criminals
  　US Imperialism Illegally Releases

    【Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 28th】Chinese people are closely watching the heinous act of the American reactionaries in releasing Japanese war criminals. MacArthur arbitrarily released the nineteen unconvicted important Japanese war criminals on the 24th and announced that the trials of major war criminals within Japan "have already concluded" and "no further trials will be undertaken in the future." After the Far East International Military Tribunal read the verdicts of the twenty-five major Japanese war criminals on November 12th, the chief prosecutor of the Far East Tribunal and US representative, Keenan, stated: the remaining nineteen Japanese war criminals currently detained in Sugamo Prison in Tokyo would be tried by another military tribunal. Less than a month and a half after these words were spoken, MacArthur released all nineteen war criminals. The released important Japanese war criminals include Eiji Amau, the active advocate of the Japanese寇 continental policy and former Director of the Information Bureau of the Tojo Cabinet, Shiro Nishio, former Commander of the Japanese寇 China Expeditionary Army, Tani Masayuki, former Ambassador to the puppet Nanjing regime, Ichio Aoki, former Supreme Economic Advisor to the puppet Nanjing regime, Yoshiho Kodama, former head of the Shanghai Japanese Navy Special Service Agency, and Nounaga Kuzu, head of the Japanese fascist organization Black Dragon Society, among other chief culprits who invaded China. The Chinese people absolutely cannot recognize MacArthur's illegal behavior.

　　日本重要战犯多人
  　美帝竟违法释放
    【新华社陕北二十八日电】中国人士正在密切注视着美国反动派释放日本战犯的罪恶行动。麦克阿瑟于廿四日已将尚未判刑的十九名日本重要战犯擅自释放，并宣布日本境内主要战犯之审判，“业已结束”，“今后不再着手任何审判”。当十一月十二日远东国际军事法庭读完日本二十五名主要战犯的判决书以后，远东法庭首席检察官、美国代表季楠曾称：现尚拘押在东京巢鸭监狱内的另外十九名日本战犯，将另组军事法庭进行审判。这话说了没有一个半月，麦克阿瑟便把十九名战争罪魁全部释放了。被释放的日本重要战犯中，包括日寇大陆政策的积极鼓吹者、前东条内阁的情报局总裁天羽英二，前日寇中国派遣军司令西尾寿造，前驻伪宁大使谷正之，前驻伪宁最高经济雇问青木一男，前上海日海军特务机关长儿玉誉志夫，以及日本法西斯组织黑龙会首脑葛生能久等侵华罪魁多名。麦克阿瑟这种违法的行为，中国人民绝对不能承认。
