The Gaoyang fabric industry in central Hebei, almost completely destroyed by the Japanese invaders and Chiang Kai-shek's bandits, is rapidly recovering with the vigorous support of the democratic government. The county's fabric industry has a history of more than forty years. Since the end of the Qing Dynasty, when heavy wooden looms began to be replaced by iron wheel looms, productivity has gradually increased. Before the "July 7th" Incident, there were more than 45,000 iron wheel looms in the county, which also drove a large number of looms in the neighboring counties of Qingyuan, Lixian, Renqiu, and Anxin. The county had thousands of weavers from other places. Most of the raw materials for weaving were shipped from Shanghai, Qingdao, Tianjin, and other places, with an annual import of more than 100,000 bales of foreign yarn. It could produce five to six million bolts of cloth. In the years before the incident, the import of foreign rayon (i.e., linen thread) reached more than 20,000 cases annually, enabling the development of more than 4,000 linen looms, which could produce more than one million bolts of linen annually. There were 21 specialized dyeing, calendering, and bleaching factories in the city for refining fabrics. The factories jointly established a school specializing in training weaving and dyeing talents. The 14 factories in the city, including Fufeng and Yifeng, used new-style machines (including calendering machines, dyeing machines, drying machines, widening machines, etc.). The factories had a total of 228 operators and 1,150 workers. In addition to collecting cloth from Shangzuozhuang in the city, these factories also had branch cloth and thread shops in Qingta in Renqiu, Cuqiao in Lixian, and Dazhuang in Manyuan. Weavers in various villages received thread from the cloth and thread shops to weave cloth and earn wages. At that time, cotton fabrics included dozens of varieties such as silk fabrics, snowflake cloths, and anti-Japanese cloths; linen fabrics included more than a dozen varieties such as satin crepe and Minghua ge, as well as various dyed Shilin and Haichang blue fabrics. In terms of product promotion, the factories had more than 60 distribution offices in major cities across the country (as far south as Singapore, as far north as Kulun in Mongolia, and as far west as major cities in Shaanxi and Gansu), with a wide sales network.

After the "July 7th" Incident, the enemy and puppets occupied the county seat, the factories closed down, and the capitalists fled to Beijing and Tianjin. The rural weaving industry suffered extortion and exploitation by the enemy and puppets. In addition, the great flood of 1939 forced farmers to abandon weaving, and many sold their looms. By the time of liberation, only 3,000 looms remained in the county, and most of them were not in operation.

After the liberation of the county seat in 1945, under the Communist Party's policy of protecting industry and commerce, the democratic government took appropriate care of the unattended factories to prevent damage to the machinery. It also provided loans and support to rural textile production, promoted the use of local thread instead of foreign thread, and paid attention to supporting local indigo dyeing factories. The factory and business managers who had fled in the past returned one after another. Six factories, including Fufeng and Xiji, started operations through joint public-private partnerships, and 2,000 rural looms quickly started spinning. The County Cooperative and state-owned stores such as Huafeng, Huaxing, and Zhongxing jointly organized local thread production to support increased production of local thread and supply raw materials for weaving. By 1947, 5,000 spinning wheels had been organized to spin local thread, collecting tens of thousands of catties per month. In the past, there were no spinning households in the county, but now women have generally learned to spin thread, and they spin very fine thread. In 1947, the Gaoyang textile industry was ravaged again by two incursions by Chiang Kai-shek's bandits. It only returned to normal after vigorous support from the democratic government. The County Production Promotion Agency and the Bureau of Industry and Commerce, in cooperation with Yuanxing Store, invested 100 million yuan of cotton in the Xiyan area of the Fourth and Sixth Districts to organize 1,700 spinning wheels, collecting 5,000 to 6,000 catties of local thread per month, controlling nearly 100 looms, and appropriately rewarding those who weave well. The County Production Promotion Agency lent 24,788,950,000 yuan for textile production, driving 407 looms. Recently, in order to support production in disaster areas, a branch was established in the old city of the county, specializing in promoting textile production from a business perspective, and plans to solve the difficulties of weaving households through loans, exchanges, and sales with a capital of 5,000 catties of cotton. More than 1,000 catties have already been transported. In addition, Daxing Yarn Factory in Shijiazhuang has set up a distribution office in Gaoyang, which can sell more than 3,000 bundles of foreign yarn every month. Now there are dozens of products such as white cloth and colored striped cloth. In terms of product promotion, Yuanxing Store can collect more than 2,400 bolts of cloth every month in the market, which are sold by various branches throughout the country, and has a distribution office in Linqing. The Production Promotion Agency collects more than 800 bolts of cloth every month, which are sold directly to southern Hebei, Shandong, and Shanxi. Distribution offices have also been established in Laishui and Botou City. Now more than 4,200 looms have been put into operation in the county, and they are increasing day by day. According to statistics from Liguo Village alone, there were 108 looms this spring, and now it has developed to 151 looms. Now the county can produce more than 19,000 bolts of white cloth and more than 8,000 bolts of various colored cloths every month. From the market in the city, in September, there were more than 1,700 bolts of cloth at each major market day, and now sales alone reach more than 3,000 bolts at each major market day. Now, in addition to the state-owned "Jianhua" and "Zhongzhong" stores using machines for dyeing and calendering, with 110 factory workers, there are 21 private dyeing workshops and 21 printing factories, with a total of 162 operators and 327 workers. It is currently the peak season for spinning and weaving. The cloth and thread market in the city has doubled compared to spring. More than 5,000 catties of thread are sold at each market day, and you can earn 5,000 yuan for spinning one catty of thread, 8,000 to 10,000 yuan for weaving one bolt of white cloth, and 20,000 yuan for one bolt of colored striped cloth. For example, Zhang Ge and his wife from Liguo Village have a group of children. This year, they did not harvest any grain, but they can solve the family's livelihood problems by weaving one bolt of cloth every two days with one loom and earning 20,000 yuan.

The current problems in the fabric industry are: first, to improve quality and overcome the generally existing shortcomings of being gorgeous but not durable, which affects promotion and sales. Second, it is still necessary to vigorously organize the production of local thread and promote new-style spinning machines to ensure an adequate supply of raw materials and guarantee the increasing production of products. Third, we should continue to publicize and implement the Party's policy of protecting industry and commerce, and encourage weaving households to operate boldly, so that the Gaoyang fabric industry will move towards full recovery.

　　高阳布业今昔
    为日寇蒋匪几已全部摧毁的冀中高阳布业，在民主政府的大力扶植下，正在迅速恢复中。该县布业已有四十余年的历史。自清末由笨重的木机开始改用铁轮机以后，生产力逐渐提高，至“七七”事变前，全县有铁轮机四万五千余张，并带动邻近的清苑、蠡县、任邱、安新等县织机甚多。全县有外来织布工人数千名。织布原料多由上海、青岛、天津等地运来，每年输入洋纱十万多包。能产布五、六百万匹。事变前几年，外国人造丝（即麻线）输入，年达两万余箱，使织麻布机发展到四千多张，每年能产麻布百万余匹。城内有专门精制布匹的染轧、漂整工厂二十一家。各工厂并联合设有一所专门训练织染人材的学校。城内的蚨丰、义丰等十四家工厂都使用新式机器（包括轧光机、染布机、干燥机、拉宽机等。）各工厂经营人共计二百二十八名，工人一千一百五十名。这些工厂除在城内集上座庄收布外，并在任邱的青塔、蠡县的萃桥、满苑的大庄等地，设有布线庄分号，各村织布户由布线庄领线织布，取得工资。当时的产品棉布有服绸、雪花＠、抗日＠等数十种；麻线布有缎被绉、明花葛等十数种及染出的各种士林、海昌蓝等。在推销产品方面，各工厂在全国各大城市（南至新加坡，北至蒙古的库伦，西至陕甘各大城市。）共设有分销处六十多所，销路甚广。
    “七七”事变后，敌伪占据县城，各工厂倒闭，资本家逃亡平、津，农村的织布业遭敌伪的敲诈勒索，加上民国二十八年的大水灾，迫使农民无法继续织布业，多把织布机卖掉。至解放前，全县只剩三千张织布机，并且大部都未转动。
    民国三十四年县城解放，在共产党保护工商业的政策下，民主政府一面对无人照管的工厂予以适当保管，不使机器损坏；一面贷款贷力扶植农村纺织，提倡以土线代替洋线，并注意扶植土靛染厂。过去逃走的工、商户经理也先后回来，蚨丰、西记等六座工厂公私合营开了工，乡村织布机两千张也很快转动起来。县联社与华丰、华兴、中兴等公营商店共同组织土线整庄扶植增产土线，供给织布原料，到民国三十六年即已组织起五千辆纺车纺整庄线。每月可收万数来斤。从前该县没有什么纺线户，现在妇女们普遍都学会了纺线，并且纺的很细。民国三十六年间，曾经蒋匪两次窜扰，高阳纺织业又遭摧残，后经民主政府的大力扶植，始恢复常态。县生产推进社、工商管理局协同元兴商店在四、六区西演一带投出一万万元的棉花，组织当地一千七百辆纺车，每月收整庄线五、六千斤，掌握了定机近百张，并对织布较好者适当奖励。县生产推进社贷出纺织款二万四千七百八十八万九千五百元，带动机子四百零七张。最近，为扶植灾区生产，在该县旧城设一分社，专从业务上推动纺织，并打算以五千斤棉花的资本，通过贷、换、卖的办法解决织布户的困难，现已运到一千多斤。另外，石家庄大兴纱厂特在高阳设一分销处，每月能售出洋纱三千多捆。现在产品已有白洋布、花条布等几十种。在推销产品上，元兴商店在集市上每月能收布二千四百多匹，由各分店代销各地，并在临清设有分销处。生产推进社每月收布八百多匹，直销到冀南、山东、山西等地。并在涞水、泊头市设立了分销处。现在全县织布机已经开动起四千二百多张，并在日益增加着。按李果庄一个村统计，今春有机子一百零八张，现已发展到一百五十一张。现全县每月能产白布一万九千多匹，各种花布八千多匹。从城内集市上来看，九月份每大集上布一千七百多匹，现在每大集光销售即达三千多匹。现在除公营“建华”与“中中”两商店使用机器染轧，工厂工人达一百一十名外，私人染坊有二十一个及印花工厂二十一个，共计经营人一百六十二名，工人三百二十七名。目前正在纺织旺月，城内集上布、线市比春天扩大一倍，每集上线五千多斤，每纺一斤线可挣工钱五千元，织一匹白布能赚八千至一万元，一匹花条布能赚二万元。如李果庄张哥应两口子，一群孩子，今年没收下粮食，就凭一张机子每两天织一匹布，赚二万元，足能解决全家生活问题。
    目前布业上存在的问题：第一是提高质量，克服普遍存在的华丽而不耐久以致响影推销的缺点。第二是仍应大力组织土线整庄，并推广新式纺线机，使原料充裕。保证产品的日益增加。第三是应继续宣传与贯彻党的保护工商业政策，鼓励织户大胆经营，使高阳布业走向全部恢复。
