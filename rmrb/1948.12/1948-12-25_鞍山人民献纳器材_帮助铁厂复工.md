　　Anshan People Donate Equipment
    to Help Steel Plant Resume Production
    [Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 22nd] Workers and residents of Anshan Iron and Steel Company are enthusiastically donating equipment to assist the company in its recovery efforts. In the past three years, the company has been ravaged by the enemy twice, production has been suspended, and many machines and tools have been lost. After Anshan was recovered in late October, the company immediately began planning to resume production, and the trade union sent cadres to cooperate with the district government to go deep into various districts to publicize the donation of equipment to residents. The propagandists told the workers and residents: The Anshan Iron and Steel Plant will forever be the property of the people, and now it is preparing to resume production, and everyone has the responsibility to help. At the same time, the company is preparing to use 50,000 catties of grain as prizes for those who donate equipment. After three days of deliberation, the residents of Lishan District donated 28 kinds of equipment, including a 350-horsepower electric roller, hundreds of catties of electric cylinder oil, eight lathes, as well as automobile internal combustion engines and electrical machinery. After Wang Anqing, an unemployed worker in Yongle District, donated more than 300 catties of machine oil, the trade union immediately introduced him to work in the factory based on his skills. Due to Wang Anqing's influence, two more workers donated two electric rollers the next day. Many workers in the urban area went to nearby rural areas to publicize, and collected equipment through personal relationships. In order to promote the donation movement, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions published "Quick Report on the Equipment Donation Movement" on the 9th of this month, to disseminate the experience of various districts in a timely manner.

　　鞍山人民献纳器材
    帮助铁厂复工
    【新华社沈阳二十二日电】鞍山钢铁公司工友及当地居民，踊跃献纳器材，协助该公司进行恢复工作。过去三年中，该公司曾两度遭敌蹂躏，生产停顿，机器工具失散很多。十月下旬鞍山收复后，该公司即着手筹划复工，并由职工会派出干部，与区政府配合，深入各区，向居民进行献纳器材的宣传。宣传者告诉工友和居民：鞍山钢铁厂从此永远是属于人民的财产了，现在它准备复工了，大伙都有扶助的责任。同时，公司又准备以五万斤粮食，作为对献纳器材者的奖品。立山区居民经过三天酝酿，献出器材已有二十八种。其中有三百五十匹马力的电滚，数百斤电缸油，旋床八台以及汽车内燃机、电气机器等。永乐区失业工人王安庆献出机器油三百余斤后，工会并根据他的技术，立即介绍他入厂工作。由于王安庆的影响，第二天又有两个工人献出了两个电滚。市区有不少工人，自动跑到附近农村去宣传，通过私人关系去收集器材。市总工会为推进献纳运动，于本月九号出版“献纳器材运动快报”，及时传播各区经验。
