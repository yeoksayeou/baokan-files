　　Public Enterprises Actively Lead and Support
  　Shijiazhuang's Private Iron Industry
  　Production Reaches Unprecedented Levels
    [Our Newspaper News] Our reporter Zeng Wenjing reports: Shijiazhuang's private iron industry, under the leadership and support of the People's Government and public enterprises after liberation, has achieved rapid recovery and development, and has now exceeded its production level in any period of its history. According to statistics: The number of factories at the end of November this year was 64 (41 during the Chiang occupation, 25 during the Japanese occupation, and 13 before the War of Resistance). The number of employees at the end of November this year was 792 (38 during the Chiang occupation, 257 during the Japanese occupation). The number of factories using electric power in August this year was 46 (24 during the Chiang occupation, 14 during the Japanese occupation). A survey on March 12 this year showed that the city only had 30 horsepower, which had increased to 140 horsepower by the end of November; some iron factories even had a tendency to transform into machine manufacturing plants. In February this year, only Shen Yongxing Iron Factory could make circular vehicles, which increased to four in September. Production has also increased. On March 18, the entire industry reported that the annual amount of iron smelting totaled 1,709 tons, and the Industry and Commerce Bureau estimated it to be at least 2,000 tons. On August 1, the entire industry reported that the annual amount of iron smelting was 2,891 tons, estimated to be at least 3,500 tons. The main products of the iron industry include circular vehicles, lathes, looms, bellows, cotton gins, roller gins, nail making machines, beading machines, rice milling machines, noodle cutting machines, small steel grinders, etc. for industrial use; as well as waterwheels, ploughshares and other tools for agricultural use, and daily necessities such as iron pots, stoves, carts, and bicycle parts. This development of Shijiazhuang's iron industry is the result of the leadership and support of the People's Government and public enterprises.
    Because the broad masses of peasants urgently need to replenish ironware after their emancipation, the small industries in the liberated small cities also need to add machinery, and transportation has been partially restored, a large amount of coal and iron raw materials can be transported into Shijiazhuang, and heavy iron goods can travel smoothly to various places east of the Taihang Mountains. Therefore, the products of the city's iron industry are in short supply. According to the perennial commercial law, the lunar May to August is the off-season for iron goods, but May and June this year were peak seasons. The main iron goods, such as beds and waterwheels, not only were not available on the market, but general orders also had to wait for a few days. The manager of Litian Machinery Iron Factory said: "Every month, there are two months' worth of work piled up, and we can't keep up!" At the Fourth District manager's symposium, everyone said: "We can't keep any goods in stock at this time, no matter how much we produce, it's not enough to sell!" Before Shen Yongxing Iron Factory even made a model of its eight-foot lathe, someone from Central Hebei had already come to order it. General merchants estimate that the sales of iron pots will not be a problem for two years.
    Before liberation, due to the Chiang bandits' blockade, raw materials could not be brought in, finished products could not be sold, and the harsh taxes and skyrocketing prices brought the industry to a standstill.
  　Public Enterprises Purchase Products
  　Supply Coal and Iron, Assist Transportation
    After liberation, in order to develop the iron industry and solve the ironware needs of various places, the democratic government accepted the industry's requests and immediately began to help them recover. The public Jinzhong Coal and Iron Store of the democratic government purchased their old inventory, and then ordered new goods so that their capital could be turned over. From just after liberation to May, it purchased 17,232 iron pots and 778 loads, 770 waterwheels, 45,388 pieces of agricultural tools, and other ironware worth a total of 2,983,837.98 new currency yuan. At the same time, in order to solve their raw material difficulties, it sold them 288,075 catties of rice, 865,300 catties of coke, 68,509 catties of pig iron, 43,252 catties of scrap iron, and 65,000 catties of grain. When coal and iron transportation was most difficult, the Shijiazhuang Railway Bureau also allocated wagons to assist private iron factories in directly purchasing from the producing areas. With such multifaceted assistance, the private iron industry developed vigorously. In terms of taxation, the democratic government immediately abolished all the surcharges and miscellaneous taxes of the Chiang occupation period after liberation, and exempted taxes during the liberation period of 1947. When collecting industrial and commercial taxes this summer, the government also clearly stipulated that machinery manufacturing (referring to those who manufacture machines such as circular vehicles, planers, drills, and lathes) is tax-free, and the actual burden of general iron industry is reduced according to the principle of not exceeding 15% of net income. The Tongyixing Iron Factory pays the most taxes, but only accounts for about 14% of its net profit. As for the faster-growing factories, it only accounts for about 10% of their net profit. At present, the products of Shijiazhuang's iron industry are still in short supply. The Shijiazhuang Municipal Government is preparing to conduct an investigation and study of the production situation of each factory in order to lead the city's private iron industry to move forward in a more organized and planned manner. Regarding labor-capital relations in the iron industry, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions conducted a survey before July this year and found that many factories did not stipulate or stipulated very low wages for workers. Working hours are generally 12 to 15 hours, with no overtime pay. The medical treatment and compensation for injuries at work have not been effectively guaranteed. Factory owners still beat and scold workers and dismiss workers at will. At the end of July this year, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions held a symposium of iron industry workers and organized a trade union. Based on the above situation, the trade union put forward requests to the factory owners for appropriate wage increases and effective guarantees of workers' welfare, which were initially resolved. Factory owners and workers agreed that there would be one day off per month with wages paid as usual. The working hours of most factories have also been changed to less than 12 hours. The factory is responsible for paying medical expenses for short-term illnesses and work-related injuries. Wages should also be adjusted appropriately.

　　公营企业积极领导扶植
  　石家庄私营铁工业
  　生产已达空前水平
    【本报讯】本报记者曾文经报导：石家庄的私营铁工业，解放后在人民政府及公营企业的领导与扶植下，获得迅速恢复和发展，现已超过其历史上任何时期的生产水平。据统计：工厂户数今年十一月底有六十四家（蒋占时四十一家，日占时二十五家，抗战前十三家）。职工人数今年十一月底为七九二人（蒋占时三十八人，日占时二五七人）。使用电动力的工厂今年八月有四十六家（蒋占时二十四家，日占时十四家），本年三月十二日调查，全市才有马力三十匹，到十一月底已增至一百四十匹；部分铁工厂且有转变为机器制造厂的趋势。今年二月能造圆车者，只有沈永兴铁工厂一家，九月增至四家。产量方面，也增多了，三月十八日全行业自报，一年溶铁量共计一、七○九吨，工商局估计最低为二、○○○吨，到八月一日全行业自报，一年溶铁量为二、八九一吨，估计最低为三、五○○吨。铁工业主要产品包括工业方面的圆车、旋床、织布机、风弓、弹花机、轧花机、钉子机、压条机、碾米机、切面机、小钢磨等；以及供给农业用的水车、铧子等工具及日常用具如铁锅、炉子、马车、自行车零件等。石市铁工业的这种发展，是人民政府与公营企业领导与扶植的结果。
    由于广大农民翻身后急需补充铁器，已解放的各小城市的小型工业也要添置机器，交通又已部分恢复，石家庄煤铁原料能大量运入，笨重的铁货可畅行太行山以东各地，于是本市铁工业产品供不应求。根据常年的商业规律，阴历五月至八月是铁货的淡月，可是今年五六月份为旺月，主要铁货如床子、水车等，不但市面上没有现货，一般订货也得等几天。利田机器铁工厂经理说：“每月堆着两个月的活，忙不过来！”四区经理座谈会上，大家都说：“这时存不住货，出多少不够卖！”沈永兴铁工厂八尺车床的模样还没有做出来，冀中早就有人来订货了。一般商人估计：铁锅在二年之内，销路不成问题。
    在解放以前，由于蒋匪封锁卡子，原料进不来，成品销不出去，苛杂繁重，物价飞腾，使该业陷于停顿状态。
  　公营企业收购产品
  　供给煤铁协助运输
    解放后民主政府为发展铁工业及解决各地铁器需求，接受该行业的请求，即着手帮助他们恢复。民主政府的公营晋中煤铁店收购其旧存货，接着又订新货，以便使其资本能够转动，从刚解放到五月止，计收铁锅一七、二三二口又七七八驮，水车七七○架，农具四五、三八八件，及其他铁器共值新币二、九八三、八三七·九八元。同时为解决其原料困难，卖给他们大米二八八、○七五斤，焦炭八六五、三○○斤，连公铁六八、五○九斤，碎铁四三、二五二斤，粮食六五、○○○斤。在煤铁运输最困难时，石家庄铁路局也曾拨给车皮协助私营铁工厂到产地直接购买。在这样多方扶助之下，私营铁工业便欣欣向荣的发展起来了。在税收方面，解放后民主政府立即废除蒋占时的一切荷捐杂税，并豁免一九四七年解放期间的税收。在今年夏天征收工商业税时，政府又明文规定机器制造业（指制造圆车、刨床、钻床、旋床等机器者）免税，而一般铁工业的实际负担，则根据不超过纯收益百分之十五的原则来减征。同益兴铁工厂纳税最多，但仅占其纯利百分之十四左右，至于发展较快的工厂，则只占其纯利百分之十左右而已。目前石家庄铁工业产品仍感供不应求。石家庄市政府正准备对各厂的生产情况进行调查研究，以便更有组织有计划地领导全市私营铁工业向前发展。关于铁工业中的劳资关系，市总工会在今年七月以前曾进行调查，发现很多工厂对工人的工资没有规定或规定得很低。工作时间一般是十二小时到十五小时，加班不加资，因工受伤的医治抚恤，并未得到确切的保障。厂主仍有打骂工人及随便开除工人的现象。今年七月底，市总工会乃召开铁业工人的座谈会，组织了工会。工会乃根据上述情况，向厂方提出了适当提高工资、切实保障工人福利等要求，当获得初步解决。由厂主及工人双方确定每月有一日休假日，工资照发。大部分工厂的工作时间，亦已改为十二小时以下。短期疾病及因工受伤的医药费由厂方负责照发。工资亦应进行适当调整。
