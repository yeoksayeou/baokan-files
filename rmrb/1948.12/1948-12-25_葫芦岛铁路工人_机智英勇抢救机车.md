　　Huludao Railway Workers
    Resourcefully and Heroically Save Locomotives
    Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 23rd. Railway workers Jin Huanzhang, Zhang Fulin, and others, resourcefully and heroically rescued eleven locomotives and over three hundred freight cars when the Chiang bandits fled from Huludao. On the morning of November 12th, three Chiang bandit military officers, under the pretext of switching trains, detained the locomotives at the docks. Subsequently, Que Hanqian, commander of the enemy's 54th Army, ordered driver Jin Huanzhang and others to drive all the locomotives and freight cars into the sea. The workers initially prevaricated and refused to comply. However, the bandit army threatened the workers, ordering them to complete the destruction plan within thirty minutes. At this critical moment, Jin Huanzhang had a flash of inspiration and drove the first locomotive at full power, violently crashing into the coal car in front, immediately overturning the coal car off the rails, blocking the tracks. When the Chiang bandit army ordered the workers to find a way to push the coal car aside, Jin Huanzhang used the excuse of retrieving tools and escaped. On another track, five Chiang bandit military officers coerced driver Zhang Fulin to drive into the sea. When Zhang refused to start the locomotive, claiming that it lacked sufficient steam, the bandit army tied Zhang to the dock, preparing to execute him. Fortunately, the ships were already departing at this time, and the bandits hastily boarded the ships to escape, allowing Zhang Fulin to avoid harm.

　　葫芦岛铁路工人
    机智英勇抢救机车
    【新华社哈尔滨二十三日电】机智英勇的铁路工人金焕章、张福林等，在蒋匪自葫芦岛逃窜时，舍身救出火车头十一个，车皮三百余辆。十一月十二日上午三名蒋匪军官借调车之名，将机车扣留在码头。随后敌五十四军军长阙汉骞即命令司机金焕章等将机车、货车全部开入海中。工人们起初支吾应付，不愿执行。但匪军威胁工人限令三十分钟内完成破坏计划。此时，金焕章急中生智，驾驶第一辆车头，开足马力，猛撞前面的煤车，立将煤车撞翻出轨，堵塞了轨道。蒋匪军下令工人们设法推开煤车时，金焕章乃借口取工具而逃走。在另一车道上，蒋匪军官五人胁迫司机张福林开车入海。当张诿称机车气不足而拒绝开动时，匪军即将张绑至码头准备枪毙。幸亏此时船舰已在开动，匪军们仓忙上船逃命，张福林才免受害。
