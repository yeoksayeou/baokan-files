    Question: Elementary school teachers work far from their homes. Can their salary rice coupons be sent home to pay public grain?
  　　　　　　　　　Wang Chengyuan, Fourth District of Zuoquan
    Answer: 1. If members of the "Blind Propaganda Team" are supply-system personnel who are detached from production, their tax exemption points can be deducted from their families.
    2. Elementary school teachers' salary rice coupons can be used to pay public grain. If they live far from home and are teaching in an administrative district other than where their home is located, they can exchange their salary rice coupons at the government for North China District or their home administrative district's rice coupons, which their family can then use to pay public grain.

    答：１、“盲人宣传队”的队员，如为脱离生产的供给制人员，则可在其家中扣除其本人的免税点。
    ２、小学教员的薪金米票用以缴纳公粮是可以的，如系离家很远，不是在其家住行署区教学，可把他薪金米票到政府兑换成华北区或家住行政区米票，由住家去顶交公粮。
