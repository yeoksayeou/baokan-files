Xinhua News Agency, Subei, 24th: According to Hong Kong newspapers recently received, Shen Junru and Zhang Bojun, Standing Committee members of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League, issued an important statement on the current situation, reiterating the League's political positions over the past year and denouncing the democratic traitor Zhang Shenfu for joining the reactionary group. The full text of the statement is as follows:

The reactionary and dictatorial Nanjing group has suffered disastrous military defeats. Famous cities such as Jinan, Jinzhou, Changchun, Zhengzhou, Kaifeng, Shenyang, Nanyang, and Haizhou have been liberated successively. The so-called new economic plan and the gold yuan and other sets of open robbery and plunder have completely failed economically. Its attempt to collude with reactionary Republican leaders in the United States, hoping to increase US aid, has also become a pipe dream diplomatically. Abandoned by all and facing its doom, the Chiang Kai-shek group has not repented. On the one hand, it continues to beg for US aid and concentrates its forces in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River for a last-ditch struggle. On the other hand, its hired writers and politicians stage ugly farces of calling for peace, hoping to win back the lost popular support and ease the people's offensive. The representative figures are Liu Butong and others, hired professors in Nanjing and Shanghai, and Zhang Shenfu in Beiping.

Zhang Shenfu used to be a member of the China Democratic League, but after he illegally declared the dissolution of the North China General Branch of the China Democratic League and the local organizations of the China Democratic League in North China in his personal name in early November last year, he had already indicated his allegiance to the reactionary group and was no longer a member of the China Democratic League. In his recent article "Appealing for Peace" in *Observation*, Volume 5, Issue 9, he proposed the strategy of making people return to the Kuomintang government, flattering the Kuomintang government "regardless of whether there is a reason for the war," dreaming that "regardless of the actual situation, politics has finally entered constitutionalism from military and tutelary rule," and even slandering the People's Liberation War as "reckless and unwise adventure" and "exhausting military force," even advising the Kuomintang government to "strive for the initiative in peace rather than in military affairs." As he himself said, it is "for another motive, another background, to seek breathing space and time for replenishment for that side," completely exposing his true colors. Therefore, the League recently announced his expulsion from membership.

In order to clarify the facts and expose the conspiracies of the reactionary dictatorial group and hired writers and politicians, the China Democratic League hereby reiterates its past and present views on democracy, peace, and unity.

In the past year, the Democratic League has issued three important documents, namely the Third Plenary Session Declaration and Political Report of January 19, 1937, and the Declaration on Launching the New Political Consultative Conference Movement of June 14. In the first two documents, it was sternly pointed out that the current war is a war between democracy and dictatorship, between the people and the enemies of the people, and called on the people of the whole country to engage in this active struggle. At the same time, it explained the position of the Democratic League: "Our attitude towards the struggle between the people and the enemies of the people, between democracy and reactionary dictatorship, should be to firmly stand on the side of the people and democracy, and fight to the end with the enemies of the people and the reactionary group, without wavering, without compromise, and without harboring the slightest illusion about the reactionary group. We must be especially vigilant against the ‘mediation,’ ‘peace,’ and ‘government reorganization’ directed by US imperialism under the banner of ‘anti-Chiang’ and ‘democracy,’ and expose its conspiracies as early as possible."

In the declaration to launch the New Political Consultative Conference, we proposed: First, a democratic New China can only be guaranteed after the reactionary dictatorial ruling group is completely destroyed. Second, a peaceful New China cannot be achieved without resolutely and thoroughly eradicating the root of the civil war and removing the obstacles to peace. If one attempts to compromise with any faction in the reactionary ruling camp before the root of the civil war and the obstacles to peace have been eradicated, this will not only fail to achieve peace, but will instead undermine true and lasting peace and help the reactionaries prolong their brutal rule. Third, a unified New China can only be fully realized after the reactionary dictatorial group that obstructs unity is eliminated and a democratic coalition government is organized through the New Political Consultative Conference.

These are the views of the China Democratic League on democracy, peace, and unity, and the views of all true patriotic democrats who stand on the side of the Chinese people should be the same. Only hired politicians and reactionary writers who are willing to work for the enemy will have other different views. It is hoped that the people of the whole country will resolutely recognize this and not be deceived or misled by them.

### 民盟发表时局声明　重申为民主奋斗决心　痛斥叛徒张申府等卖身投靠

　　民盟发表时局声明
  　重申为民主奋斗决心
  　痛斥叛徒张申府等卖身投靠
    【新华社苏北二十四日电】据最近收到的香港报纸刊载，中国民主同盟中央常务委员沈钧儒、章伯钧发表重要时局声明，重申一年来该盟政治主张并痛斥民主叛徒张申府投靠反动集团。该项时局声明全文如下：
    南京反动独裁集团，在军事上遭受惨重失败，济南、锦州、长春、郑州、开封、沈阳、南阳、海州等名城，相继解放，在经济上所谓新经济方案，和金圆券等一套公开抢劫、掠夺丹方完全失败；在外交上勾结美国共和党反动头子，希冀增加美援的企图，亦成泡影。众叛亲离，日暮途穷。蒋介石集团并未悔祸，一方面继续哀求美援，并在长江下游集中兵力，以作垂死挣扎；另一方面，则由其御用文人、政客，演出呼吁和平的丑剧，以期收拾已失之人心，缓和人民之进攻。其代表人物，在京沪为御用教授刘不同等，在北平为张申府。
    张申府过去曾经是民主同盟的盟员，但是在去年十一月初，他以个人名义，非法声明解散华北民盟总支部和华北各地方民盟组织以后，他已表示投靠到反动集团，不再是民主同盟的盟员了。他最近在观察五卷九期呼吁和平一文中所提出的使人心来归向国民党政府的计策，“不管战争之起，有无理由”的替国民党政府的阿谀，“不管实情如何，政治到底已由军政、训政进入宪政”的梦话，以至诬蔑人民解放战争为“不仁不智的冒险”和“穷兵黩武”，甚至劝国民党政府“在军事上争取主动，不如在和平上赢得主动”，正如他自己所说，是“别有动机，别有背景，为那一方面谋取喘息整补空隙时间”，完完全全暴露出本来面目，所以最近本盟宣布开除他的盟籍。
    中国民主同盟为了明正视听，揭穿反动独裁集团和御用文人政客的阴谋，于此重申过去和现在对于民主和平统一的看法。
    民盟过去一年内，曾发表了三个重要文件，即三十七年一月十九日的三中全会宣言和政治报告，和六月十四日的展开新政协运动声明。在前两个文件里，严正指出当前的战争是民主和独裁，人民和人民公敌的战争，并且号召全国人民从事此项积极斗争。同时说明民盟的立场是：“我们对于人民与人民公敌之争，对于民主与反动独裁之争，我们的态度应该是坚决站在人民的民主的这一方面，跟人民公敌、反动集团斗争到底，决不动摇，决不妥协，决不对反动集团存有丝毫的幻想。而对美帝国主义所企图导演以‘反蒋’‘民主’为旗帜的‘调解’‘和平’‘政府改组’，尤须提高警惕，应及早揭穿其阴谋诡计”。
    在展开新政协的声明中，我们曾经提出：第一，民主的新中国，只有在彻底摧毁反动独裁的统治集团以后，才能获得保障。第二，和平的新中国，非坚决彻底铲除内战的根源，扫除和平的障碍不可，若希图在内战根源与和平障碍没有铲除以前，与反动统治阵营中任何派系妥协，这不但不能达到和平，反足以破坏真正的持久的和平，帮助反动派延长其残暴的统治生命。第三，统一的新中国，只有在消灭统一障碍的反动独裁集团之后，通过新政协组织民主联合政府，才能完全实现。
    这是中国民主同盟对于民主、和平、统一的看法，凡是站在中国人民立场的真正爱国民主人士的看法，都应当如此。只有甘心的为虎作伥的御用政客与反动文人，才会有别的不同的看法。切望全国人民坚决的认清，不要被他们欺骗和蒙蔽了。
