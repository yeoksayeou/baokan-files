[Taiyuan Frontline Telegram] Reporter Wu Xiang reports: "Only uprising and surrender are the only way out." This is the summary of recent experiences by Zheng Jizhou, the Major General Commander of the Yan Faction's Provisional 45th Division. During the Jinzhong Campaign in July, the Yan Faction suffered over 100,000 casualties, but Zheng's unit narrowly escaped from Xugou. However, within three months, his entire army was annihilated again in the heavily fortified area near Taiyuan. Zheng Jizhou said: "I thought I could escape, but I didn't; I thought I could defend, but I couldn't. But I was too deeply deceived by Yan Xishan, thinking that the People's Liberation Army would either kill or humiliate senior officers like me. Therefore, when I was first captured, I was full of confrontational emotions. Later, when I saw Commander Zhao Chengshou and Army Commander Shen Rui living and studying happily, I was greatly surprised. After being enlightened by the military and political leaders, I realized that surrendering to the people is not a disgrace. Soon, Deputy Division Commander Wang Shuwu and others were also liberated. They told me that when I was captured, the Second Regiment Commander Wang Xiushan, who risked his life to break through and escape back to Taiyuan, was publicly beheaded by Yan Xishan. He left behind his old mother, weak wife, and two orphans, who had no means of living. Anyone at this point would no longer fail to recognize which is the road to life and which is the road to death." Zheng Jizhou is 44 years old, originally from Lizhai Village, Yicheng, Shanxi. His entire family of over twenty people lives in Taiyuan, and their life is extremely difficult. Seeing that the reporter expressed doubt about this, he generously said: "I haven't been a general for even a year. My monthly salary is only worth half a stone of wheat. How can I support my family? It's embarrassing to say, but my father and elder brother have to go to the streets to sell burnt soil, and the whole family can't afford a new cotton-padded coat for two years. Yan Xishan himself is extremely extravagant, but he is extremely harsh to those below. If you don't have a backer, you might be killed for taking a few empty positions. Xie Yunxiang, the deputy commander of the Third Regiment of the Provisional 44th Division, was beheaded for embezzlement because the families of some fallen soldiers were crying all day long, and the superiors didn't provide them with family rations, so he had to temporarily allocate some public funds to help them. The Iron Army cadres reported this, and he was convicted of corruption and beheaded. The son of Wang Fengshan, the former commander of the Provisional 44th Division, also sells newspapers on the street. The families of other division commanders and regiment commanders who are vendors are everywhere. The difficulties of lower-ranking officers and soldiers are even more imaginable." At this point, Zheng expressed his heartfelt regret for the few Yan army officers and soldiers who, like him, were deceived and misled by Yan Xishan, and who are still hovering between death and starvation, afraid to resolutely lay down their weapons. He finally said to the reporter: "I will try to tell all my friends and subordinates the truth I have learned, that only uprising and surrender are the only way out."

　　被俘阎匪暂四十五师师长
  　郑继周谈亲身体验  投降起义才是生路
    【太原前线电】记者吴象报导：“只有起义和投降是唯一的生路。”这是阎匪暂四十五师少将师长郑继周对他最近各种经历的总结。七月晋中战役，阎匪被歼数逾十万，郑部侥幸从徐沟漏网。然而不出三月，就又在太原近郊坚固设防地带中全军覆没。郑继周说：“我以为能跑，结果没有跑脱；我以为能守，也没有守住。但是我受阎锡山的蒙蔽太深，以为解放军对我这样的高级人员，不杀即辱。因此刚被俘时，还充满着对抗情绪。过来见到赵总司令承绶、沈军长瑞都在愉快地生活、学习，不禁大为惊异。以后又蒙各军政首长开导，方知向人民屈服，并非耻辱。不久副师长王树武等也被解放，他们告诉我：当我被俘时，冒死突围逃回太原的二团团长王秀山，竟被阎锡山刀砍示众了。留下六十来岁的老母弱妻及两个孤儿，衣食无着。无论什么人，到这时候都不会再认不清哪是生路，哪是死路。”郑继周现年四十四岁，原籍山西翼城里砦村，全家二十余口，均寄居太原，生活极为困难。他见记者对此表示怀疑，就慷慨地说：“我这个将官还没有当够一年，每月薪给只抵半石小麦，如何养得起家？说来不怕见笑，家父家兄都不得不上街去卖烧土，全家两年做不起一套新棉衣。阎锡山自己穷奢极欲，对下面却苛刻透顶。如果上头没有后台，稍为吃几个空额，也许就有杀身之祸。暂四十四师三团副团长谢云祥，因为一些阵亡部属的家眷成天哭哭啼啼的，而上边又不发给眷属粮，没办法，只好暂先拨一部分公款救济，结果被铁军基干报告上去，竟以贪污论罪，刀砍处死了。前暂四十四师师长王凤山的儿子，也在街头卖报。其他师长、团长的眷属当小贩摆摊子的，比比皆是。下级官兵的困难，更可想而知。”至此，郑对少数和他一样被阎锡山欺骗蒙蔽的阎军官兵，迄今尚在死亡与饥饿面前徘徊，不敢毅然放下武器，表示痛心的惋惜。他最后又对记者说：“我要设法把我认识了的真理，告诉所有的朋友和部属，即只有起义和投降是唯一的生路。”
