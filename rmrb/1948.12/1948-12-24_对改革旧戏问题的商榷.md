　　A Discussion on the Reform of Old Operas
    Quan
    After reading the People's Daily's No. 150 editorial, "Carry Out the Reform of Old Operas in a Planned and Step-by-Step Manner," I have two questions that I haven't been able to resolve. I'm raising them now:
    First, the editorial states: "Old operas that promote superstition and ignorance, such as the appearance of gods and ghosts on stage, and emphasize that immortals are the masters of human destiny, should be banned or allowed to be performed only after significant modifications. As for general mythological stories, such as Sun Wukong's Havoc in Heaven, they can be performed." I don't understand the latter half of this principle. I think: Sun Wukong's Havoc in Heaven has its special characteristics. The Havoc in Heaven is a revolution against the Buddha, but unfortunately, he surrendered later and was eventually imprisoned under a mountain and sentenced. If it is explained before the performance that this story is fictional, I think it's okay to perform it. However, the editorial treats it as just one of the general mythological stories, using it as an example. The editorial seems to suggest that all general mythological stories can be performed. There are many general mythological stories. Taking the local operas of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan region as an example, the following are popular here: Gao Lao Zhuang (Pigsy marrying a wife), Pansi Cave (Tang Monk's party encountering spider spirits), Zhang Kui Digging Underground (killing Tu Xingsun), Zhao Gongming Descending the Mountain, as well as the Yin-Yang Umbrella (a carp spirit causing trouble in the Jin Dynasty story), Broken Bridge (the love story of the White Snake and Xu Xian), and so on. Can all these stories be performed? I'm not clear.
    Before reading the editorial, I thought these things should all be stopped, because I thought: At present, our task of promoting science and opposing feudal superstition is far from being completed. Then we should continue to complete it. We don't need to manage these plays for the time being. After the performance, the audience will see the gods and ghosts in a concrete and vivid way. The gods and ghosts in people's minds have not been cleared away, and we are deepening them, isn't that harmful? That was my original thought. After reading the editorial, I thought that if these stories were made into fairy tales for the people, they would not contain much toxicity. But this does not solve my ideological problems. I feel that people do not yet have the cultural level to treat them as fairy tales when watching operas.
    The North China Literary and Art Symposium has determined the policy of reforming old operas, which is to remove their feudal and reactionary elements. The editorial only raised the issue of "harmful," which I feel is not specific enough. Therefore, it is impossible to follow in specific practice. I also thought of Sun Wukong's Havoc in Heaven, bringing Yang Erlang, Li Tianwang and these people onto the stage. Strictly speaking, are these things not harmful? Are they not part of feudal reaction? Thinking like this, the more I think, the more confused I become. The work of reforming old operas has already begun by the North China Audio-Drama Association, which is certainly gratifying, but that editorial also mentioned that everyone needs to participate more. Since everyone is going to participate, the first thing to do is to align everyone's principles. The editorial only mentioned the principles of harmful and beneficial. From my own work needs, I feel that more specificity is needed. I feel that there are degrees of harmfulness. For example, the old concept of cause and effect and retribution exists in almost every old opera. Seriously speaking, isn't this concept harmful? But if it is so strict, 99% of old operas will not be able to be performed immediately. If the concept contained in each play is changed to the idea that the power of the people determines everything, and the power of the people is the cause of all fruits, wouldn't that be a very difficult thing to do? So, "the harmful must be banned or modified," which is of course correct: but, I hope that the issue of degree can be clarified more.
    Second, the editorial mentioned that the reform of old operas is the responsibility of the North China Audio-Drama Committee and all literary and art workers, which is of course correct; but I personally feel that this seems to be far from enough. Of course, my idea is not necessarily correct, but in order to solve practical problems in the work, I will raise it here.
    Take the Hebei-Shandong-Henan region as an example, hundreds of rural opera troupes have become increasingly active since autumn. It is estimated that they will be even more active during the Spring Festival. The plays they perform are not completely unified in each region. Some plays are available south of the Yellow River, but not north of the Yellow River; some plays are available in Huxi, but not in southwest Shandong. And many plays are created in "competing performances" (the so-called competing performance means that two troupes sing against each other, competing for who knows more. At this time, the masters of the opera troupe often discover a divergence from the family tree of Luo Cheng, Yang Zongbao, Xue Dingshan, etc., and create a new one). With such complex content and such large regional differences, I personally feel that it would be difficult for literary and art workers alone to complete its reform task in the short term.
    I feel that since this matter concerns the broad masses of the people, in order to seek a real solution, it is impossible not to rely on the leadership of party organizations at all levels. Now rural opera troupes are singing everywhere. If we can mobilize the party branch committee comrades, or the main cadres of the subdistrict, to discuss with the opera troupe before the performance based on their understanding, grasp the selection of programs, then it will be better than the current situation. At the same time, I also thought that the creation of a few people is often incomparable to the creation of everyone. If we can clearly put forward the principles of reform, let our broad cadres and masses grasp the principles, and participate in this work, that seems to be the best way. Take the cadres as an example, even though they are not literary and art workers, there are many who have liked local operas since childhood. I think that if we can first clarify the principles, and then the party mobilizes everyone to jointly modify them, and then continue to lead in the process of modification, then why can't one old script be changed into several usable versions? I think it might be better than the scripts modified by literary and art workers.
    After reading the editorial, I thought about it for a long time, and I couldn't draw a clear conclusion in my mind. Now I write it all out in the hope of arousing everyone's research.

### 对改革旧戏问题的商榷

　　对改革旧戏问题的商榷
    ＠荃
    读了人民日报第一五○期专论：“有计划的有步骤的进行旧剧改革工作”，有两个问题，考虑未能解决，现在把他提出来：
    第一、专论上说：“提倡迷信愚昧的旧戏，如舞台上神鬼出现，强调宣传神仙是人生主宰者等，是应该加以禁演或经过重大修改后方准出演的，至于一般神话故事如孙悟空大闹天宫的戏，则是可以演的”这个原则的后半节我没有想通，我想：孙悟空大闹天宫，有他的特殊性，闹天宫是革如来的命，可惜后来投降了，结果压在山下判处了徒刑。这个故事在演出以前说明是假的，演一演我觉得是可以的；可是，专论却是把它当作一般的神话故事中间的一个，作为举例说明的，专论是认为一般的神话故事都可以演的。一般的神话故事说起来就多了，拿冀鲁豫区的地方戏来说吧，这儿流行着：高老庄（猪八戒娶媳妇）、盘丝洞（唐僧一行遇蜘蛛精）、张奎钻地（打死土行孙）、赵公明下山，还有阴阳伞（鲤鱼精捣乱晋朝故事）、断桥（白蛇恋爱许仙）等等，这些故事是不是都可以演呢？我闹不清。
    读专论以前，我认为这些东西都该停演，因为我想：目前我们提倡科学反对封建迷信的任务，距完成还差得很远，那么我们就该继续来完成，这些戏我们且不必去管他，演出以后总使观众具体形象的看见了神仙鬼怪。人民脑子里的神仙鬼怪本来没肃清，我们再加深它不是有害处吗？这是我原来的想法。看了专论以后，我想到如果把这类故事使人民当成童话来看，倒也不含很大毒素。但是这并没有解决了我的思想问题，我觉着人民看戏的时候，今天还没有把他当成童话看的文化水平。
    华北文艺座谈会，确定了改造旧剧目的方针，是去掉其封建反动部分，专论中则只提出了“有害”问题，我感觉似乎还不够具体，所以具体做起来，就无法遵循。我又想到孙悟空大闹天宫，把杨二郎、李天王这些人搬上舞台，这些东西严格说起来难道不是有害的吗，难道不是属于封建反动的吗？这样想来，越想就越糊涂了。改造旧剧工作，华北音剧协会已开始做，这当然值得高兴，但是那篇专论也提到更需要大家动手。既然要大家动手，首先就要大家把原则一致起来才行，专论只提到是原则有害和有利，我从自己的工作需要感到还更需要具体。有害的原则，我觉着也有分寸，比方说吧：旧的因果报应观念在每一个旧剧里，差不多都存在着，这个观念认真说来，难道不是有害的吗？可是如果这样严格的话，百分之九十九的旧剧马上都不能演了。如果把每一个戏里所包含的这种观念都改成人民力量决定一切，人民力量是万果之因，那不是很难的一件事吗？所以“有害的必须禁演或修改”，这当然是对的：但是，这里面的分寸问题，我希望能够更明确。
    第二、专论提到改革旧剧是华北音剧委员会和文艺工作者大家的责任，这当然是对的；但是我自己感觉这似乎还很不够。我这想法当然不一定对，不过为了解决工作中的实际问题，这里也把他提出来。
    就拿冀鲁豫来说吧，几百个农村剧团，入秋以来已经日益活跃起来了，估计春节期内还要活跃，他们会的戏各地区也并不完全统一，有的戏在黄河南有，在黄河北就没有；有的戏在湖西有，在鲁西南就没有，并且有很多戏都是在“对戏”中对出来的（所谓对戏，就是两个班子对唱，比赛谁会的多，这时候戏班里的师傅就往往从罗成、杨宗保、薛丁山等人的家谱上发现一个岔子，又编出一个新的来），这样复杂的内容、这样大的地方差异，我自己感觉光靠文艺工作者，恐也很难在短期内完成他的改革任务。
    我觉着既然这件事是关系广大人民的事，要想求得真正的解决，不依靠党的各级组织的领导是不行的。现在农村剧团到处都在唱戏。如果我们能发动党的分委同志，或者小区主要干部，在农村剧团演出之前，根据自己的了解和剧团商量一下，掌握一下节目的取舍，那也比现在的情况会好一些的。同时，我还想到几个人的创造与大家的创造往往是无法比的，如果我们能把改革的原则明确的提出来，让我们的广大干部和群众掌握原则，并且参加这一工作，那才似乎是最好的办法。就拿干部说吧，尽管他们不是文艺工作者，可是从小就喜欢地方戏的实在多的很。我想，如果我们能首先把原则明确了，然后党发动大家，共同修改，在修改的过程中再加以不断领导，那么一个旧剧本，何尝不可能改出几种能用的本子呢？我想可能比文艺工作者改出来的剧本还要好呢。
    读了专论以后，反复的想了好久，思想上不能得出明确的结论来，现一并写出希望引起大家的研究。
