Xinhua News Agency, North China, 28th—Yan Xishan, at the end of his rope, is using the most barbaric and cruel means to drive prisoners released by the People's Liberation Army back into battle. More than a thousand officers and soldiers of the Yan bandit "Vengeance and Struggle Corps" 108th Regiment, who laid down their weapons in Hancun on the Taiyuan front, were mostly Yan army officers and soldiers captured and released by the People's Liberation Army in various battles in Shanxi. After returning, they were immediately seized by Yan bandits and thrown into concentration camps, where they suffered all kinds of mental and physical torture. Then, they were forcibly organized by Yan bandits into the so-called "Vengeance and Struggle Corps" and sent to the front line as cannon fodder. According to Chen Chaobin, the regiment's staff officer: Yan Xishan's concentration camp is called the "Return to Dryness Corps." All officers and soldiers released by the People's Liberation Army were locked up in the "Return to Dryness Corps." As soon as they entered this concentration camp, they had to "confess upon landing," and after being assigned to a class, they had to write a "confession." After that, they were subjected to severe torture by Yan bandit secret agents. At the "confession and rebirth" meeting, many people were beaten to death. According to what Chen knew, Liu Deji, the squadron leader of the Yan bandit assault machine gun battalion, was stabbed to death by random gunfire, and Zhang Guodong, the regimental commander of the Yan bandit tenth detachment second regiment, was beaten to death with clubs. Chen said: "Once I saw six people end up like this. They were stripped naked by special agents, tied to wooden frames, and then their flesh was cut off with bayonets." In Yitang Village, where the "Return to Dryness Corps" was located, four or five mu of land outside the village were filled with people who had died like this, and the stench of corpses was nauseating. We suffered such physical and mental devastation that many people became mentally deranged. Diseases were rampant in the "Return to Dryness Corps," people died every day, and it became a ghastly living hell. Those who were lucky enough to survive had to have ten family members act as guarantors, and if one person "committed a crime," the entire family would be punished. They also had to write a "repentance letter" and make a confession before being "assigned" to the "Vengeance and Struggle Corps." The so-called "assignment" meant that four characters had to be tattooed on their arms or foreheads with steel needles, some saying "Resolutely Oppose Communism," and others saying "Swear to Exterminate Communism." In this way, Yan bandits spread rumors, saying: "The People's Liberation Army will behead anyone they capture who has been tattooed," in order to intimidate them into selling their lives for Yan bandits." The officers and soldiers of the engraved seal have now arrived in the rear of the Liberated Area. They are all deeply grateful for the People's Liberation Army's repeated leniency.

　　“雪耻奋斗团”放下武器官兵
    控诉阎匪集中营罪行
    对我军再度宽大深表感激
    【新华社华北二十八日电】日暮途穷的阎锡山，正以最野蛮残忍的手段，驱逼由解放军释放回去的俘虏作战。在太原前线罕山放下武器的阎匪“雪耻奋斗团”一零八团千余名官兵，其中大部分是解放军在山西历次战役中俘后释放的阎军官兵。他们回去后立即被阎匪抓入集中营中，历尽精神上和肉体上的种种折磨之后，又被阎匪强迫编成所谓“雪耻奋斗团”，送上前线当炮灰。据该团参谋陈朝斌谈：阎锡山的集中营叫“返干团”。凡被解放军释放回去的官兵都被关进“返干团”里去，一进这个集中营就得为“落地供”，编了班又要写“自白书”，这以后就遭受阎匪特务的严刑拷打。在“自白转生”会上不知多少人被打死了。据陈所知，其中遭乱枪刺死的有阎匪冲锋机枪大队的中队长刘德吉等，遭乱棍打死的有阎匪十总队二团团长张国栋等。陈说：“一次我就看见这样结果了六个。他们被特务剥光衣服，绑上木架，一会就用刺刀剐了。”“返干团”所在地的亦堂村，村外就有四五亩地埋满了这样死去的人，尸臭触鼻。我们受到这样肉体上和精神上的摧残，神经失常的很多。“返干团”中疾病流行，天天死人，成了阴风惨惨的活地狱。侥幸留得性命的人，要有亲属十人的连环保，一人“犯罪”，亲族同诛。并且还要写“悔过书”，立供状，这样才“刺配”到“雪耻奋斗团”去。所谓“刺配”，就是要在臂上或额上，用钢针刺四个字，有的是“坚决反共”，有的是“誓死灭共”。这样，阎匪又造谣说：“解放军捉住刺了字的要杀头”，以恫吓他们为阎匪卖命死拼。”刻该印官兵已开到解放区后方。他们对解放军的再度宽大，无不深表感激。
