　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 7th. Reports from various sources: The strike movement in Japan continues to expand. The vast majority of coal miners have successively joined the strike wave according to the planned schedule. The strike movement has also spread to metal miners, chemical fiber industry workers, and shipyard workers. At the same time, 40,000 maritime workers held their second nationwide strike within a week. The three-day strike by Japanese coal miners, which began on November 30, entered its final day on the 2nd of this month, with approximately 127,000 workers participating. On the first day, there were 145,000 participants, and on the second day, about 120,000. The three major coal miners' unions in Japan are planning another strike in the event that the management does not propose new suggestions. Minister of Commerce and Industry in the Yoshida Cabinet, Oya Shinzō, lamented on the 1st: "The strike may become a long-term affair, thereby shattering the plan to produce 36 million tons of coal in this fiscal year." From midnight on the 1st, 75,000 metal miners across Japan mostly joined a 48-hour strike. 23,000 chemical fiber industry workers were also ordered on the 2nd to be "ready to strike upon receiving notice," which will affect four major rayon and cellophane companies in Japan. The All-Japan Seamen's Union has also ordered 70 percent of Japanese ships to cease operations for 72 hours starting from midnight on the 3rd in protest against the government's firm refusal to concede on the issue of wage increases. At the same time, more than 14,000 workers from Japan's three major shipyards began a 24-hour strike on the morning of the 3rd, demanding a year-end bonus of approximately 5,000 yen.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 7th. Reports from various sources: Under the supervision of MacArthur's headquarters, the Japanese Diet passed the anti-strike law on the 1st of this month, which violates the Potsdam Declaration and the new Japanese Constitution. This bill denies government employees the right to collective bargaining and strike, depriving 2.76 million government employees (including state-owned enterprises) in Japan of basic democratic rights. The members of the Japanese Communist Party in the Diet consistently and resolutely opposed the passage of this bill during the debate and voting in order to safeguard the interests of the working class. This bill was drafted according to MacArthur's letter to former Prime Minister Ashida on July 22nd of this year. When the House of Representatives debated the bill, William, a representative of the government group at MacArthur's headquarters, attended the meeting overnight, "personally safeguarding the bill."

　　日本二十万矿工罢工
  　化学工人造船工人等亦卷入工潮
    【新华社陕北七日电】各方报导：日本罢工运动继续扩大，绝大部分煤矿工人已依照预定计划接连卷入罢工浪潮，罢工运动且已扩及金属矿工、化学纤维业工人及造船业工人。同时，四万海员工人亦于一周内举行第二次全国性罢工。自十一月三十日开始的日本煤矿工人三日罢工，至本月二日已进入最后一日，参加的工人约十二万七千人。第一日为十四万五千人，第二日约十二万人。日本三大煤矿工人工会，正计划在资方未提出新建议的情况下布置另一罢工。吉田内阁商工相大屋晋三于一日悲鸣称：“罢工可能成为长期的事，从而将粉碎本会计年度产煤三千六百万吨的计划。”从一日午夜起，全日各地七万五千名金属矿工，大都已参加四十八小时的罢工。化学纤维业工人二万三千人，亦于二日奉命“随时准备于接获通知后罢工”，这一罢工将影响及日本四家大人造丝及赛璐璐公司。全日海员工会，亦已命令百分之七十的日本船只于三日午夜起，停驶七十二小时，以抗议政府对增加工资问题的坚不让步。与此同时，日本三大造船厂的一万四千余工人，已于三日晨开始进行二十四小时罢工，要求年终赏金约五千日元。
    【新华社陕北七日电】各方报导：日本议会在麦克阿瑟总部的监督下，于本月一日通过了违反波茨顿宣言、违反日本新宪的反罢工法。这一法案否认政府雇员有进行集体议价与罢工的权利，将使日本二百七十六万政府机关（包括国营企业）的职工，失去基本的民主权利。日本共产党的议员们，在辩论和表决时，都始终为维护工人阶级的利益坚决反对通过这一法案。按此项法案系依照本年七月二十二日麦克阿瑟致前首相芦田的函件所拟就。当众院辩论该法案时，麦克阿瑟总部政府组代表威廉，彻夜出席会议，“亲自为该法护航”。（路透社）
