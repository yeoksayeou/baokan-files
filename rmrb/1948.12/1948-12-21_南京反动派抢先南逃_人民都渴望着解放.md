　　Nanjing Reactionaries Flee South in Haste
    People Yearn for Liberation
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 19th] The Kuomintang's corrupt officials are fleeing in a panic, yet in isolation, from Nanjing, the capital they have occupied for twenty-one years. An Agence France-Presse dispatch from Nanjing on the 15th stated: "Chiang Kai-shek's confidants are currently destroying or packing up files and documents, preparing to flee the capital. Most government offices are deserted, with high-ranking officials busy transporting their families and property, booking flights to Taiwan, Guangzhou, and especially Hong Kong. Many are leaving without notice. No one doubts the imminent arrival of the new regime." The massive counter-revolutionary organ, the Kuomintang Central Party Headquarters, now has only sixteen people working. A dispatch from the Kuomintang Central News Agency in Nanjing on the 4th, published a statement by Chiang Kai-shek's spokesman, Tang Enbo, Commander-in-Chief of the Garrison Headquarters of the Capital and Shanghai, saying: "The current panic is really unnecessary, and fleeing and relocating are even more inappropriate. You must know that we are all revolutionaries, the leader is a revolutionary leader, the cadres are revolutionary cadres, and the army is a revolutionary army. I ask, can a revolutionary team flee?" However, the bandit chief Chiang Kai-shek himself is not more composed than his confidants. The Hong Kong Wen Wei Po reported on the 9th of last month: "Chiang Kai-shek has been unusually irritable recently. According to guards from the 'Presidential Palace,' Chiang frequently pounds the table with his fist and kicks people, not even sparing Soong Mei-ling." The same newspaper reported on the 4th of last month: "After the liberation of Jinan, Chiang Kai-shek had a 'major nervous breakdown,' firing more than ten shots at the ceiling with his pistol and killing his beloved dog." This extremely vicious mass murderer and traitor, who knows his doomsday is near, clearly lacks the power to maintain the confidence of his subordinates. But only a very small number of reactionaries are fleeing. The vast majority of citizens in the major cities controlled by the Kuomintang are yearning for the arrival of the People's Liberation Army. An Associated Press dispatch from Peiping on the 4th of this month stated that, apart from a very small number of people whom the People's Liberation Army will regard as war criminals, who are "rushing to escape," "Peiping... is awaiting the Communists with secret concern." The Tianjin Ta Kung Pao, a newspaper of the Kuomintang political and academic circles, which has always supported Chiang and opposed the Communists, acknowledged in an editorial published on the 4th of this month: "The torrent of refugees flows from North China to Central China, to South China, and finally some people fly far away, escaping to foreign countries. In fact, this flow can only represent the upper class, and the number of people is not large." This fact, on the one hand, shows that the Kuomintang reactionaries have been extremely isolated and unpopular, and on the other hand, shows that the People's Liberation Army's policy of protecting cities, and the policy of treating enemy personnel with "punishing the ringleaders, not questioning those who were coerced, and rewarding those who perform meritorious service," has become universally rooted in the hearts of the people.

### 南京反动派抢先南逃　人民都渴望着解放

　　南京反动派抢先南逃
    人民都渴望着解放
    【新华社陕北十九日电】国民党的贪官污吏们正在慌乱地但是孤独地逃出他们盘据了二十一年的首都——南京。法新社十五日南京电称：“蒋介石的亲信们，刻正消毁或捆起文件卷宗，准备逃出首都。多数机关都没有人到场办公，高级官员则正忙于运走他的家属和财产，并预定赴台湾、广州特别是香港的飞机。许多人不告而去。新的政权的行将来临是谁都不怀疑的了。”庞大的反革命机关国民党中央党部，现只剩十六个人办公。国民党中央社南京四日电讯，发表了蒋介石的代言人京沪警备总司令汤恩伯的谈话说：“象目前这样的惊惶，实在是不必要的，尤其逃跑搬迁更属大不应该。要知道我们大家都是革命的，领袖是革命的领袖，干部是革命的干部，军队是革命的军队。试问革命的队伍是可以逃跑的吗？”但是匪首蒋介石本人并不比他的亲信们更镇静一些。香港文汇报上月九日称：“蒋介石近来异常暴躁。据‘总统府’卫士传出，蒋不时以拳击桌，用脚踢人，连宋美龄亦不能幸免”。同报上月四日又称：“济南解放后，蒋介石曾‘大发神经’，以手枪向屋顶连放十余枪，并击毙其爱犬”。这个自知末日已近的穷凶极恶的大杀人犯和大卖国贼，显然是没有力量再使他的部下保持信心了。但逃跑的只是极少数的反动派。国民党控制的各大城市的绝大多数市民，却正在渴望着人民解放军的到来。本月四日美联社北平电讯称，除了极少数的将被解放军视为战犯的人“匆忙逃跑”以外，“北平……正以隐秘的关切心情等待着共军”。在根本立场上素来拥蒋反共的国民党政学系的天津大公报，在本月四日发表的社论中，亦承认：“逃难的洪流由华北而华中，而华南，最后还有些人远走高飞，遁往异邦，其实，这股流向只能代表上层社会，人数不多”。这个事实，一方面表示国民党反动派已经极端众叛亲离，另一方面表示人民解放军的保护城市政策，和对待敌方人员“首恶者必办、胁从者不问、立功者受奖”的政策，已经普遍地深入人心。
