Sooner is Better Than Later, Earlier is Better Than Faster
    ——Remembering the Yan Jun's "Wipe Out Shame and Strive" Regiment Laying Down Their Weapons Early
    He Hui
    Since the day Yan Bandit's attack on Shangdang ended in a disastrous defeat, his officers and soldiers who laid down their weapons in entire regiments and divisions have been treated with leniency and education by the People's Liberation Army. At that time, many of them longed for their parents and wives, so the People's Liberation Army gave them ample travel expenses and food, and sent them home batch after batch, to do some beneficial things for the people, and not to help Yan do evil again. However, the People's Liberation Army had just rescued them, and Yan Bandit cruelly threw them into the abyss of death again. After returning, Yan Bandit immediately locked them up in the "Return Cadre Regiment" (i.e., concentration camps for released officers and soldiers). After severe torture, they were then assigned to the "Wipe Out Shame and Strive" Regiment. When the People's Liberation Army attacked Taiyuan, the "Wipe Out Shame and Strive" Regiment was thrown on the front line, fifty li away from the city, on Hanshan Mountain to prepare for field operations. On July 15th and 16th, the People's Liberation Army continuously attacked Hanshan Mountain, controlled by Yan Bandit's Bao 9th Regiment. The No. 1 and No. 2 bunkers were taken down by the People's Liberation Army. On the 17th, the 108th Regiment of the "Wipe Out Shame and Strive" Regiment withdrew from the flank position of Chafang Temple and transferred to the front to take over the task of guarding the bunkers on Hanshan Mountain. The remaining four regiments, led by Shi Zebo, sneaked towards Taiyuan. A defense line spanning ten li from north to south, with fifty-six bunkers, sixty-four firing points, and thirteen pillboxes, was assigned to a small regiment of a thousand people to guard separately. It was clearly a call for them to die. Du Qinglian, the platoon leader of the 6th Company of the regiment, said: "We knew the end of守 (shǒu - guarding), and if we persisted to the end, we would inevitably get on a 'plane' (i.e., be bombed to death while guarding the bunker). Therefore, our confidence had long been roared away by the fierce artillery fire of the People's Liberation Army. There was an incident of twelve soldiers escaping overnight." On the evening of the 17th, our People's Liberation Army, in coordination with artillery, attacked the No. 4 command bunker of the trenches. They had already known the fierceness of our army's artillery fire, and this bombardment made them even more surprised. When Chen Chaobin, the staff officer of the 108th Regiment, inspected the bunkers, what he encountered was not fighting, but many officers and soldiers asking them to point out a way out. At this time, another unit of our army had quickly wedged into the Lijiashan, Mengjiajing, and Hanshan defense lines from Yulinping, leaving them isolated behind the People's Liberation Army's attack, and the route back was completely cut off. Li Peiying, the commander of the 108th Regiment, wavered in his determination to defend to the death, and wanted to abandon the No. 4 command bunker to temporarily avoid our army's assault, but after we captured the No. 4 bunker, we began to attack the No. 5 bunker on Dian'er on the evening of the 18th. The enemies trapped in the two isolated bunkers on Yunmeng Mountain were also bombarded by our army's artillery fire, and more than half of them were killed or wounded. At dawn on the 19th, Li Peiying anxiously called Deputy Regiment Commander Wang Zhilie to study the situation. He said: "Looking at this situation, Hanshan Mountain is a commanding height that the People's Liberation Army must contend for. Continuing to fight will inevitably lead to injury or death. If we don't want to be captured again, retreating is actually a dead end, and even more hopeless. Besides, throwing us on Hanshan Mountain means Yan Xishan doesn't want us anymore." At this time, they received news from the telephone that the No. 5 bunker had been captured by us, and hurriedly notified Battalion Commander Li Zhiyuan and Staff Officer Chen Chaobin to hold a meeting. Fortunately, they found a way out of death: laying down their weapons "sooner rather than later" and "earlier rather than faster." Therefore, they sent Staff Officer Chen Chaobin to contact our army to negotiate the surrender. At this time, this command group was still fantasizing that Yan Bandit would send troops to rescue them, and issued three urgent telegrams in a row. However, Yan Bandit had already regarded them as his funeral objects, and not a single soldier was able to rescue them, so there was not a single word in response. The People's Liberation Army approved their request to lay down their weapons early. On the afternoon of the 19th, more than a thousand officers and soldiers of the 108th Regiment of the "Wipe Out Shame and Strive" Regiment, led by Regiment Commander Li Peiying, left the bunkers and assembled at the location designated by our army to lay down their weapons. Now they have left the front line and gone to the rear of the People's Liberation Army to rest, and are still receiving generous treatment. Because we understand that the majority of the officers and soldiers of the "Wipe Out Shame and Strive" Regiment were forced by Yan Bandit to come and sell their lives. As long as they can wake up in a critical moment and lay down their weapons, the people can still understand them. Other Yan army officers and soldiers should learn a lesson from this clear fact and quickly lay down their weapons. Only in this way can they turn away from death and towards life.

　　迟不如早，早不如快
    ——记阎军“雪耻奋斗团”提早放下武器
    何徽
    自从阎匪进攻上党惨败的那一天起，他的整团整师放下武器的官兵便受到解放军的宽待和教育。当时他们中间不少人渴念自己的父母妻子，解放军便给了他们充裕的路费、粮食，一批又一批的遣送他们回家，为人民做些有益的事情，不要再助阎为恶。可是，人民解放军刚刚将他们拯救出来，而阎匪又残酷地将他们抛向死亡的深渊。回去以后，阎匪立刻将他们关到“返干团”（即被释官兵的集中营）。经过严刑拷打，再把他们刺配到“雪耻奋斗团”去。当解放军进攻太原的时候，“雪耻奋斗团”被抛在距市区五十华里远的第一线罕山上作野战准备。在七月十五、十六两天，解放军连续进攻阎匪保九团控制的罕山。其一号、二号碉被解放军拿下来了，十七日，“雪耻奋斗团”一零八团撤离茶房庙侧翼阵地，转入正面接替罕山的守碉任务，其余的四个团由史泽波带上，偷偷摸摸向太原逃去。一段南北十里长的防线，有五十六个碉保，六十四个火力点，十三个地堡，令千把人的一小团来分头把守。分明是叫他们去送死。该团六连排附杜清廉谈：“我们知道守的下场，坚持到最后，不免是坐上‘飞机’走，（即守碉被炸而死）因而信心早被解放军的猛烈炮火吼跑了。曾发生一夜逃亡十二个士兵的事情。”十七日晚，我解放军步炮协同攻堑壑四号指挥碉，本来他们早已知道我军炮火的猛烈，这次轰击使他们越发吃惊了。当一零八团参谋陈朝斌巡视各碉时，遇到的并不是战斗，而是许多官兵要他们指出一条生路。这时，我军另一部已由榆林坪迅速楔入立家山、孟家井、罕山防线孤单地掉在解放军进攻的后面，归路完全切断。一零八团团长李佩膺企图死守的决心动摇了，想借放弃四号指挥碉暂避我军冲锋，但我继克四号碉后，十八日晚又开始攻店儿上的五号碉，困守云梦山两个孤碉的敌人也被我军炮火轰击，死伤过半。十九日拂晓，李佩膺焦虑地找来副团长王治烈研究情况，他说：“看此局势，罕山为解放军必争的制高点，打下去非伤即亡，若不再作俘虏，转进实际上是死路，更属无望。再说，把我们扔到罕山，阎锡山就是不要咱们了。”此时，他们从电话上得到五号碉被我攻占的消息，匆匆忙忙通知营长李志远、参谋陈朝斌来开会，总算不错，从死里找到一条“迟不如早”“早不如快”的放下武器的生路。于是派陈朝斌参谋来与我军接洽缴械事宜。就在此时，他们这个指挥集团还幻想阎匪派兵来援救他们，一连发出三份火急的电报。可是，阎匪早已将他们当作他的殉葬品，并无一兵一卒能够援救他们，故无一字回答。人民解放军批准了他们提前放下武器的请求。十九日下午，“雪耻奋斗团”一零八团一千余官兵，在团长李佩膺率领下，离开碉堡，在我军指定的地点集合放下武器。现在他们已离开前线开到解放军后方去休息，依然受到宽大的待遇。因为我们了解“雪耻奋斗团”的大部分官兵是被阎匪强迫抓来卖命的，只要能在紧急关头幡然觉悟，放下武器，人民仍然能够谅解他们，其他阎军官兵应该从这个显明的事实里找到教训，赶快放下武器，唯有如此方可离死就生。
