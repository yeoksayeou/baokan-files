　　Xinhua News Agency, Luoyang, 6th. Many impoverished people in Luoyang City have now been organized by the People's Government into small-scale public factories for production. This is one of the good experiences in solving the living difficulties of urban poor people. Since August, the municipal government has established seven public commercial firms, based on administrative districts, and set up small factories for shoes, towels, and soap, organizing poor citizens to produce shoes, spin thread, knit sweaters, and transport goods. According to statistics from mid-September, the Xiefeng Commercial Firm in District One alone had organized more than 3,000 citizens for production. The shoe factory under this firm produces more than 900 pairs of shoes and more than 500 shoe soles daily. The Guangfeng Shoe Factory in District Two organized 32 shoe-making teams, with the participation of 250 citizens. There are also seven small shoe workshops that receive funds from the shoe factory to produce finished products on a contract basis. The municipal trading company purchased a total of more than 33,000 knitted woolen vests from citizens in one month, from mid-September to mid-October. Although engaging in production to solve living difficulties is the urgent demand of the city's poor, they were once worried at the beginning of production due to the rumors spread by Kuomintang secret agents. Women were afraid of becoming "female soldiers" and that making shoes for a long time would make them "public employees." Men suspected that they would be organized into "transport teams," so they adopted a wait-and-see attitude. After the two public firms held discussion meetings to explain the situation, especially after a few women earned wages by making shoes and solved their living difficulties, they dispelled those concerns and accepted the government's call. Due to the development of textile production and the increased need for cotton, the number of cotton fluffer businesses in the city has increased from 16 before August to 52. The manufacture of cotton gin machines has also increased by more than ten.

　　洛阳普设公营工厂组织贫民进行生产
    【新华社洛阳六日电】洛阳市的很多贫民，现在已被人民政府组织在公营的小型工厂中进行生产。这是解决城市贫民生活困难的良好经验之一。从八月开始，本市政府即以行政区为单位，先后设立七个公营商行，下设鞋、毛巾、肥皂等小型工厂，组织贫苦市民进行做鞋、纺线、织毛衣、运输等生产。据九月中旬统计，本市一区协丰商行组织起来进行生产的市民就有三千余人。该行所设鞋厂每日做鞋九百余双，鞋底五百余双。二区广丰鞋厂组织了三十二个做鞋小组，参加的市民有二百五十人。另有七个小型鞋坊，向鞋厂领取资金包做成品。本市贸易公司从九月中旬到十月中旬一个月内，收买市民织制的毛线背心共有三万三千余件。从事生产解决生活困难，虽然是全市贫民的迫切要求，但因他们受国民党特务谣言迷惑，在开始进行生产时，曾一度有所顾虑。女的怕当“女兵”，怕长期做鞋成了“公家人”，男的怀疑会被编成“运输队”，因此抱观望态度。经公营两行召开座谈会进行解释，特别是在少数妇女以做鞋赚工资解决了生活困难之后，他们就消除了那些顾虑而接受了政府的号召。由于纺织生产发展，棉花的需要增加，该市弹花业已由八月以前的十六家增至五十二家。弹花机制造业亦增加了十余家。
