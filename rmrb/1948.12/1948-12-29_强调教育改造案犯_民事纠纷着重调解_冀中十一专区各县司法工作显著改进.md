(Reported by this newspaper) Since the judicial conference in June, the counties of the Eleventh Prefecture of Hebei-Chahar-Hebei Border Region have grasped the correct spirit of handling offenders, corrected some past "leftist" deviations, and implemented the policy of rehabilitation through education. At the same time, they restored the village mediation and district mediation office organizations, reducing unnecessary litigation and shifting judicial work towards a proactive approach. Before June, especially during the period of land redistribution, various counties had absorbed outstanding peasant representatives to form people's courts, promptly suppressing the sabotage activities of reactionary landlords, rich peasants, and enemy agents, directly encouraging the emotions of the peasants' struggle. However, at that time, due to the lack of understanding of the principles of judicial work by cadres, some deviations occurred. In Gaocheng, the execution of criminals did not adhere to the approval system, judgments were not made, and notices were not posted. In Zhao County, too many offenders were detained, and attention was not paid to organizing production, resulting in offenders being unable to make a living. After discovering the above situation, the Prefectural Commissioner's Office convened a meeting of deputy directors of various counties in early June, affirming the achievements of judicial work in the land reform, criticizing the erroneous viewpoints of "killing is the fastest way" and "suppression first," as well as the phenomenon of random arrests and detentions, clarifying the policy of rehabilitation through education, and proposing the slogan of "factories and schools in prisons." Since then, the counties have begun to pay attention to this. In addition to implementing the spirit of the June meeting, Shulu County also held judicial symposiums for representatives of public and private factories, shops, and citizens in towns and cities, reflecting the concerns of merchants and civilians who felt that their rights and property were not guaranteed due to the random deductions and fines in the villages, and doctors were afraid to treat patients boldly for fear of government intervention if the patient died, providing an important basis for cadres to establish a revolutionary spirit of the rule of law. Shen County emphasized the production and education of prisoners and achieved redemption of guilt through labor. Prisons organized prisoners into short-term labor, cotton ginning, weaving, ironworking, and flour milling groups according to their different skills and labor, which not only solved the prisoners' livelihoods but also accumulated capital to expand operations. Several months ago, prisoners were organized to dig rivers in the north, and when the enemy raided Hejian, three prisoners resolutely completed the task of saving fire and preserving documents and firearms, and were approved by the special zone to have their sentences reduced by one to three years, which had a great impact. After Jin County changed its viewpoints and clarified its policy, it was found that most of the twenty-three prisoners originally prepared for the death penalty could be reformed by sentencing them to imprisonment after reconsideration.

In the restoration of district mediation offices and village mediation work, Shen County and Shulu County were particularly good. Since the Civil Affairs Assistant Conference, each district in Shen County has established mediation procedures. In July, August, and September, the Thirteenth District alone mediated more than 30 cases, and carried out registration and issued mediation documents. The Fourth District also retained case files. According to statistics from 81 villages in five districts of Shulu, 45 villages were able to carry out general mediation. In October, six villages mediated more than 100 civil disputes. The Zhuangji problem between Zhou Xingtong and Lin Laoming in Beipang Village, the second district, which had been in dispute for many years without results, was also resolved satisfactorily. From the understanding of eight counties and cities in the entire special zone, among the 349 ordinary criminal cases closed in July, August, and September, 189 were sentenced to imprisonment, 111 were given education and release (released after education), bail and release (released on bail), and penal labor, 13 were reconciled according to the actual situation, and 8 were sentenced to death, which not only grasped the principle of not killing or killing less, but also went through formal judicial procedures. Because emphasis was placed on the production of prisoners, except for prisoners awaiting trial in Zhao County, all achieved self-sufficiency in production, saving financial expenditures and ensuring the health of prisoners. Due to the restoration of grass-roots mediation work, unnecessary litigation has been reduced. At present, except for Zhao and Luanxi counties, there are very few prisoners in various counties, and judicial cadres have gotten rid of simply engaging in indoor trials and turned to taking the initiative. However, in the new transition process, two major shortcomings have also emerged. One is that cadres have low policy levels and unclear sentencing standards, resulting in the phenomenon of disproportionately light or heavy sentences. Zhao County mostly adopted simple education and release for handling theft offenders, so the effect was minimal. Forty-seven cases were handled in July, August, and September, and another 37 theft cases occurred in the first half of October. For example, Ningjin handled rape offenders more heavily than enemy agents. The second is that cadres have a vague understanding of the purpose of prison production and social production, harboring a purely profit-making viewpoint, and neglecting the aspect of reforming prisoners' minds through labor. Shen County once had a situation where the lives of prisoners were higher than the lives of the masses, and Jin County had a period when prisoners were taking surplus grain home, which aroused dissatisfaction among the masses, and at the same time, it was not good for the ideological reform of prisoners. These shortcomings have recently been reviewed at the Joint Meeting of Deputy Directors, and the counties are overcoming them. (Xing Jun)

　　强调教育改造案犯
    民事纠纷着重调解
    冀中十一专区各县司法工作显著改进
    【本报讯】冀中十一专区各县，从六月司法会议后，掌握了正确处理案犯的精神，纠正了过去某些左的偏向，贯彻了改造教育方针。同时恢复了村调解、区调处的组织，减少了不必要的诉讼，使司法工作开始转向主动。六月以前，特别是平分时期，各县曾吸收优秀的农民代表参加组成人民法庭，及时镇压了反动地富和奸特分子的破坏活动，直接鼓舞了农民斗争的情绪。但当时因干部缺乏对司法工作原则的掌握，发生了一些偏向。藁城处决人犯，不坚持批准制度，不作判决，不贴布告；赵县扣押差犯过多，不注意组织生产，致犯人生活没法解决。专署领导上发觉上述情况后，于六月初召开了各县副厅长会议，肯定了土改中司法工作的成就，批判了以杀为快镇压为主的错误观点，和乱捕乱扣的现象，明确了改造教育方针，并提出监所工厂化、学校化的口号。从此各县提起了重视。束鹿县除贯彻六月会议的精神外，并举行了市镇公私工厂、商店、市民代表司法座谈会，反映出商民因见到村中乱扣乱罚，感觉人权财权没保障，医生不敢大胆治疗，怕病人死了政府干涉等思想顾虑，提供了干部树立革命法治精神的重要根据。深县重视犯人的生产和教育，并做到了以功赎罪。监所将犯人按不同技术和劳力编为短工、弹轧、织纺、铁工、磨面等小组从事生产，不但解决了犯人的生活，还积累资本扩大经营；数月前组织差犯到北部挖河，正逢敌人窜扰河间，三名差犯坚决完成了救火和保藏文件枪支的任务，经专区批准减刑一年至三年，影响很大。晋县转变观点明确方针后，原来准备判死刑的廿三个犯人中，经重新研究，认为绝大部分可以用判徒刑的办法达到争取改造。
    在恢复区调处村调解工作上，尤以深县、束鹿两县为好。深县自民政助理会议后，各区都建立调处手续，七、八、九月份，只第十三区即调处卅多件，并进行登记、发调处书，四区还存有卷宗。束鹿据五个区八十一个村的统计，有四十五个村能进行一般的调解；十月份，六个村即调解民事纠纷百余起。二区北庞村周兴同与林老明的庄基问题，争执多年没有结果，此次也得到了圆满解决。从全专区八个县市的了解，七、八、九月份已结案的普特刑事三百四十九件中，判徒刑者一百八十九人予教释（经教育后释放）、保释（取保后释放）和罚劳役者一百一十一人，按实际情况和解者十三件，判死刑的八人，既掌握了不杀或少杀的原则，并均经过了正式的司法手续。因为重视了犯人生产，除赵县未决犯外，全部做到了生产自给，节省了财政开支，保证了犯人的健康。由于下层调处工作的恢复，减少了不必要的诉讼，目前除赵、栾西县外，各县差犯很少，司法干部已摆脱了单纯陷入室内审讯而转向主动。但在新的转变过程中，同时产生了两个主要缺点。一是因为干部政策水平低，量刑标准不明确，而产生判刑畸轻畸重的现象。赵县处理偷盗犯多采取简单的教育释放，因而收效极小，七、八、九月份处理四十七件，十月上半月又发生偷盗案卅七件；又如宁晋处理奸淫犯重于奸特犯。二是干部对监所生产和社会生产的目的认识模糊，存有单纯盈利观点，忽视以劳动改造犯人思想的一面。深县曾有一度犯人生活高于群众生活，晋县一个时期犯人往家里捎节余粮食，都引起群众不满，同时对犯人的思想改造也没好处。这些缺点近来已在副厅长联席会上作了检讨，各县正在克服中。（行军）
