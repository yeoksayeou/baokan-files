Xinhua News Agency, Huaihai Front, December 24th: (Delayed) A front-line reporter reported on the process of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army blocking the Li Yannian and Liu Ruming corps who dreamed of rescuing Huang Wei's corps, stating that: A certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, coordinating with fraternal units to encircle and annihilate Huang Wei's corps, launched a strong blocking battle against the Li and Liu bandits on the battlefield spanning over 70 li on the west side of the Jinpu Railway between the Hui River and the Fei River. The slogan "Do not let the enemy advance, ensure the victory of the annihilation battle on the northern front" became the unanimous belief of all commanders and fighters. At the beginning of the battle, the ninth company of a certain regiment had just entered the Shiqiaozi position and had not yet built fortifications when the enemy launched an attack. The company immediately dispatched a platoon to cross the Qinggou River to intercept the enemy, covering the construction of fortifications on the north bank of the river. On the afternoon of the 6th, two enemy battalions secretly crossed the Qinggou River and advanced towards the ninth company's position. Zhang Guanghe, the branch committee member, was wounded in the head, blood flowing down his face, but he still loudly called out: "Comrades, fight resolutely!" The branch secretary called on everyone to shoot calmly, "One shot, one enemy." When the enemy crawled to the front of the position, the entire company immediately formed a concentrated fire network, fiercely shooting. When the enemy scurried back at nightfall, 130 enemy corpses were left in front of the position. At the same time, the sixth company and part of the fourth company of the regiment defended Zhoukouzi, resisting an enemy battalion that was advancing on the right flank. Wang Yuangang, the squad leader of the fifth squad of the sixth company, insisted on staying on the front line despite being wounded twice. The bunkers of two squads were collapsed by enemy artillery fire, and after all the personnel were buried in the soil, they bravely climbed out again, removed the mud from the muzzles of their guns, and continued to shoot at the enemy. Under these circumstances, the regiment defended the Shiqiaozi and Zhoukouzi (30 li northwest of Bengbu) line. After seven days and nights of fierce fighting, the enemy paid a heavy price in casualties but ultimately failed to move forward a single step. On the 7th, five companies of a certain regiment guarding Chenji, north of the Fei River, again repelled the attack of a regiment of Li bandits. When two battalions of the enemy pounced on the sixth company's position in three routes, advancing to about 80 meters in front of the position to a ditch, the sixth company suddenly fired with concentrated firepower. After a day of fierce fighting, more than 300 enemies were killed, while the sixth company only suffered three minor injuries. The ratio of enemy to own casualties reached one hundred to one. From the 2nd to the 7th, a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army killed or wounded more than 4,000 enemies in the blocking battle. In the following days, although the enemy struggled forward at the cost of heavy casualties, they crawled less than five li per day. Until the Huang Wei Corps was completely annihilated on the 15th, they were still blocked on the banks of the Fei River, and finally turned around and fled south on the 17th.

　　我歼灭黄维兵团战斗
  　蒋匪增援完全失败
  　每日爬行不到五里
    【新华社淮海前线二十四日电】（迟到）前线记者报导解放军某部阻击梦想救援黄维兵团的李延年、刘汝明两兵团的经过称：配合兄弟部队围歼黄维兵团的解放军某部，在浍河、淝河之间津浦路西侧纵横七十余里的战线上，对李刘二匪展开坚强的阻击战。“不让敌人前进，保证北线歼灭战的胜利”的口号，成为全体指战员一致的信心。战斗开始时，某团九连刚进入石桥子阵地，还未构筑工事，敌人就发动攻击。该连立即以一个排渡过清沟河拦截敌人，掩护河北岸构筑工事。六日下午，敌两个营偷渡清沟河，向九连阵地进犯，支部委员张光禾头部负伤，血流满面，还高声号召：“同志们，坚决的打！”支部书记则号召大家沉着射击，“一枪打一个”。当敌人爬至阵地前沿时，全连立即组成集中的火网，猛烈射击，到天黑敌人回窜时，阵前遗尸已一百三十具。同时，该团六连与四连的一部，则坚守周口子，抗击着由右翼迂回进犯的敌一个营。六连五班班长王元刚二次负伤仍坚持不下火线。两个班的地堡被敌人炮火震塌，全部人员被埋在土里后，又都奋勇地爬了出来，去掉枪口上的泥，继续向敌人射击。该团就在这种情况下坚守了石桥子、周口子（蚌埠西北三十里）一线，经过七昼夜激战，使敌人付出了重大伤亡的代价而终未能越过一步。七日，守卫淝河以北陈集的某团五个连，又击溃李匪一个团的进攻。当两个营的敌人分三路向六连阵地猛扑，进至阵前约八十米处一条水沟前面时，六连突以密集火力射击，激战竟日，毙敌三百余名，而六连仅轻伤三名。敌我伤亡比例达到一百比一。从二日至七日，解放军某部在阻击战中，已毙伤敌人四千余名。此后数日，敌人虽以惨重伤亡为代价挣扎着向前爬，但每日爬行还不到五里，直到十五日黄维兵团全部覆灭时，还被阻在淝河边上，终于在十七日掉头南逃。
