　　Deep Ploughing, Careful Cultivation, and More Manure
    This Year's Harvest Exceeds by Twenty Stone
  　Cao Linshui Also Formulates a Three-Year Production Plan
    [Taihang News] Cao Linshui, a labor hero from Changzhi, has summarized this year's production and formulated a three-year production plan. This year, further improvements in intensive farming and more fertilizer application (an average of 90 loads per mu) were achieved, with specific fertilizers for specific land (rich fertilizer and pig manure for sunny slopes, sheep manure, pen manure, and oil cake for shady areas and bottoms of gullies), and specific crops for specific land (wind-resistant millet and "169" wheat planted on high slopes, and "Hen's Beak" and "Big White" millet planted in gullies). As a result, this year's total grain harvest reached 64 stone and 4 dou, exceeding last year's actual grain production by 20 stone and 6 dou. After summarizing this year's production, the family's enthusiasm for production is very high. Before November 25th, a family meeting was convened to formulate a three-year plan for building the family. The whole family consists of two male full laborers, two female full laborers, one elderly person, and two children, a total of seven people. They cultivate 37.8 mu of land and have one donkey and half a mule. The goals for the next three years are: (1) Agriculture: 1. Intensive farming: Autumn land will generally be plowed twice, harrowed four times, and raked twice; an average of 90 loads of soil fertilizer and 40 jin of oil cake per mu, and 18 loads of manure, guaranteeing this year's yield level. Starting in 1949, reclaim two mu of wasteland each year, increasing coarse grain production by two stone. Plant three mu of "811" millet, two mu of "Golden Queen" corn, and three mu of "169" wheat, increasing grain production by four stone each year. Strive to increase grain production by twenty-four stone in three years. 2. Replenish farm tools: This year, buy a new cart (for a total of two carts including the old one), buy a two-legged seeder, and in 1950, buy a harrow, a large cart manure bucket, and replenish small farm tools this year. 3. Next year, transfer the existing half mule to another family, and buy another donkey to complete two livestock. (2) Sideline Occupations: 1. Take advantage of spare time to engage in transportation, striving for an annual income of seven stone of millet. 2. Spinning and weaving: Two women are currently engaged in spinning and weaving (only one can weave). From this winter to the autumn harvest next year, spin 30 jin of cotton and weave 24 zhang of cloth. After deducting nine zhang of cloth for the family's clothing and buying cotton, there will be a surplus of three zhang, which can be sold to buy five dou of millet. In 1950, improve skills and buy a new-style hand-pulled shuttle loom, weaving 28 zhang of cloth and spinning 35 jin of cotton throughout the year. In addition to clothing, add a new quilt and two mattresses, striving to sell four zhang of cloth and earn nine dou of rice. Maintain the original level in 1951. 3. Starting in 1949, first buy five sheep, and by 1951, develop the flock to 24 sheep (including purchases and births). There are currently five hens. Starting in 1949, develop four each year, developing a total of 15 in three years. Strive for annual egg production to solve the family's salt consumption problem. 4. Plant trees and create forests: A total of 290 trees are required to be planted and survive within three years. 5. Repair the dilapidated house within three years.
