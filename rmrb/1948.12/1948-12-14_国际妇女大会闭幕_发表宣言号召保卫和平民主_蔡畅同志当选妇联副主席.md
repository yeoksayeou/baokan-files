　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 11th: TASS reports: The Second International Women's Congress issued a declaration to women, mothers, and sisters around the world on the 6th, calling on them to rise up in unity to defend democracy. The declaration fiercely criticized the American and British imperialists in the United Nations General Assembly for obstructing the passage of the Soviet Union's proposal on disarmament and banning atomic weapons, criticized the revival of German militarism and Japanese war potential, the Marshall Plan undermining the sovereignty of various countries, and the imperialist wars waged by American, British, French, and Dutch imperialists against the people of Greece, Indonesia, Vietnam, China, and Malaya. The declaration called out: Women of colonies and dependent countries! Launch your struggle against imperialism and for national independence! Women of the world! Let us join with other world democratic organizations to form a united and consolidated front against the instigators of new wars! The Second International Women's Congress, representing 80 million women from 56 countries here, declares: For peace and democracy, for the security and independence of all nations, for the happiness of our children and families, we will fight more bravely and powerfully. Our strength is infinite. We will win the victory of peace and democracy through joint efforts.
　　
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 11th: TASS reports: The Second International Women's Congress closed on the afternoon of December 6th. After debating the report on the development of the democratic movement of women in Asian and African countries, the Congress read out congratulatory letters to the Congress from various groups. The afternoon session of the Congress adopted a resolution on the report on the development of the democratic movement of women in Asian and African countries, and the Congress adopted the newly elected leadership of the International Democratic Women's Federation. Eugénie Cotton of France was elected President of the Federation, and Nina Popova of the Soviet Union, Dolores Ibárruri of Republican Spain, Cai Chang of China, and Gene Weltfish of the United States were elected Vice-Presidents. Because the number of Federation members has greatly increased since the First Congress, the Congress decided to expand the staff of the leadership, and elected two additional vice-chairmen, nominated by women's organizations from Poland and Britain respectively, and the Congress has authorized the Standing Committee of the Federation to approve these two nominations. Marie-Claude Vaillant-Couturier, a French garment worker, was elected Secretary-General of the Democratic Women's Federation, and Zinaida Gagaarina of the Soviet Union, Elisa Uriz of Republican Spain, and representatives from the Chinese Liberated Areas and the American women's organizations, respectively, were elected secretaries of the Federation. The Congress also elected the Executive Committee of the Democratic Women's Federation, which included representatives from 24 countries including Britain, India, China (Liberated Areas), Poland, Romania, the Soviet Union, the United States, France, Czechoslovakia, Free Greece, Hungary, the Mongolian People's Republic, and Korea. Representatives from nine countries including Albania, Belgium, France, the Netherlands, the Soviet Union, Norway, the United States, Czechoslovakia, and Vietnam were elected to the Audit Committee.
