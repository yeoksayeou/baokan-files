　　Zhao Rui Talks About Bandit Yán Xīshān
　　Wu Xiang, Gao Fan
　　Zhao Rui, the former commander of the 8th Corps of the Yan army, who led his troops in an uprising on the Taiyuan front, spoke to reporters about Yán Xīshān's recent tricks. It turns out that this local emperor, who has dominated Shanxi for more than 30 years, fearing the powerful firepower of the People's Liberation Army, has crawled like a ghost into the deep and dark cave in Donghuayuan, not daring to see the sun. But he is still obsessed with money as always. Although the gloomy cave can’t help but remind him of hell, he still calculates how to collect money all day and night and is still reluctant to forget about money. After Taiyuan was besieged, first came "cash distribution and requisition," followed by "certificate issuance and borrowing," and finally simply "unpriced expropriation." Not long ago, he took out a large number of "relief supplies" to lure citizens to buy them. As soon as the money was swindled, he immediately fabricated reports of victory and launched a "support the army" campaign, forcing the citizens who had spent money to spit out their belongings again. He deducted the salaries of all bandit army officers and soldiers on various pretexts and accumulated countless "legal tender," but as a result, he was tricked by Chiang Kai-shek's "gold yuan coupons." Of course, he had to find his subordinates to pay the bill for his loss. The newly received gold yuan coupons are not distributed, and what is distributed down are all worthless waste paper - "legal tender." After the four airports in Taiyuan were successively occupied and controlled by the People's Liberation Army, he hurriedly repaired the Fen River Airport in the west of the city; Chiang Kai-shek, worrying that the fall of Taiyuan would jeopardize Beiping and Tianjin, also hurriedly airlifted the 83rd Division from Yulin, flying thousands of miles to accompany him in his burial. But after only four battalions arrived, he discovered another danger, fearing that Chiang Kai-shek would squeeze him out. He is so anxious about gains and losses, and so obsessed with money, that he sometimes tries his best to declare that solid defense is not a problem, and at other times he cries out in distress and desperately asks for help.

　　Zhao Rui said: Yán Xīshān's greatest skill is sophistry. In the Jinzhong campaign, under his direct command, an army of 100,000 was completely wiped out. But he slammed the table and said: "The Ministry of National Defense scolds me for being a coward, your commander-in-chief and army commander are the real cowards! They didn't follow my correct instructions to be flexible and mobile, and kicked away all my capital!" In short, everything he does is right. He often issues an order, then issues another order to change it, and then the third order is different from the second order. Sometimes it changes as many as ten or twenty times a day. When his perplexed subordinates can't cope and complain, he says instead: "This is progress! The overall war is becoming more and more complex, and only constant changes can improve and progress!" In fact, he not only likes to deceive others, but also likes to deceive himself, begging for help from superstition and fantasy. He appointed Gao Zhuozhi as the commander of the Southeast Defense Zone. "South" sounds the same as "difficult," which he felt was very unlucky, so he stubbornly changed it to the South-East Defense Zone Commander. Zhao Rui said: Fu Zuoyi's attempt to attack Shijiazhuang by surprise greatly excited Yán Xīshān. As soon as Bandit Fu moved, he vigorously boasted: "A powerful army to aid Jin is about to arrive in Taiyuan." He called from under the cave to ask: "Are the cannons of the People's Liberation Army on the east mountain turned to the east?" When the answer was no, he cursed: "Where are your eyes? Hurry up and send someone to supervise the sentries and observe carefully." So a few minutes later, as a result of "careful observation" according to Yán Xīshān's subjective wishes, the People's Liberation Army's cannons actually "changed" direction. As soon as he heard the sound of airplanes, he immediately wanted to know the number of casualties of the People's Liberation Army. The bandit officers investigated level by level. The person at the front, who clearly hadn't even seen where the bombing took place, had to fabricate figures, thirty here, fifty there, and add them up happily, reaching a total of "80,000," becoming one of the miracles praised by Yán Xīshān. Many so-called "amazing miracles" first appeared from that deep and dark cave, were "confirmed" through phone calls, then "reported" back, and were then "created" successfully.

　　"Greedy for money, afraid of death, and doesn't sleep," Zhao Rui used these three sentences to draw a vivid caricature of the feudal demon king Yán Xīshān. "Doesn't sleep" means that although he has crawled into the cave, he is still busy all day long, tirelessly killing people. He disrupts the organization of each unit, monitors each other, and sends his "adjutant staff" to the troops to "enforce the law and supervise the battle" on his behalf, and encourages these executioners to kill people boldly. He said murderously: "Your position is the lowest, but your authority is the highest. Any officer or soldier who wavers can be executed on the spot." The number of wronged souls is countless. In the Naoma main position alone, there were dozens of officers and soldiers who were "executed," including Liu Yongwang, the commander of the 3rd Regiment of the 40th Division, Zhao Dianzhang, the battalion commander of the 2nd Regiment of the 8th Corps, Zhang Dafu, the battalion commander of the 3rd Regiment, and Hou Chongde, the company commander. This is the main reason why the morale of Yán's bandit officers and soldiers is so low, and yet they are so "trapped" and "counterattacking" to sell their lives for Yán Xīshān. Now, all his troops have been crippled. The Security Regiment has been filled in, and the People's Guard has also been filled in. He is also grabbing students, workers, and vendors, and has put forward the bloody slogan of "fighting city." This means that all men, women, old and young in Taiyuan city, from the ages of seven to sixty, must be responsible for reconnaissance, combat, transportation, and construction of fortifications, without exception. The miser Yán Xīshān is only generous with other people's lives. As long as he can live a day or even an hour longer, he will not hesitate to use the heads of thousands of people to fight. His 40th Division, under his coercion, kept rushing back and forth, and in the end, only a hundred or so people were left. The casualties of the 8th Corps were also very heavy. Therefore, Zhao Rui finally said very sadly: "Our initial determination was not enough, and we didn't dare to revolt quickly. Many officers and soldiers were innocently sacrificed. If we don't act decisively again, we will all die! Yán Xīshān's heart is too poisonous and cruel, and he will never let you go if there is one person left!"

　　赵瑞谈阎匪锡山
    吴象　高帆
    率部在太原前线起义的原阎军第八总队司令赵瑞，对记者谈了阎锡山最近的鬼把戏。原来这个独霸山西三十余年的土皇帝，慑于解放军强大的炮火，已经幽灵似的爬进了东花园又深又暗的地洞，不敢和太阳见面。但是财迷却依然如故，尽管那阴森森的地洞不能不使他联想到地狱，他还是整日整夜盘算着如何搜刮，对钱财还是不肯忘情。太原被围困后，先来了个“发款征购”，继之是“发证征借”，最后索性“无价征用”了。不久以前，他拿出大批“救济物资”，诱迫市民购买，等钱一骗到手，紧接着就捏造捷报，发动“劳军”，强制花了钱的市民，再吐出东西来。他以种种借口克扣全体匪军官兵的薪饷，积存了无数的“法币”，结果却被蒋介石的“金圆券”一下坑了，他吃了亏当然要找部下出帐，现在新领到的金圆券都不发放，往下发的尽是无法兑换的废纸——“法币”。太原四个机场陆续被解放军占领控制以后，他急忙赶修城西汾河机场；而耽心太原失守会使平津不保的蒋介石，也急忙从榆林空运八十三师，不远千里飞来替他陪葬。但是才到了四个营，他又发现了另一种危险，怕蒋介石挤掉了他。他是如此的患得患失，财迷心窍，忽而竭力声明固守无虞，忽而又哀呼危急，拼命求救。
    赵瑞说：阎锡山最大的本事是强词夺理。晋中战役，在他直接指挥之下，十万大军，全数覆没。但他却拍着桌子说：“国防部骂我孬种，你们的总司令、军长才是真正的大孬种！不按照我正确的指示灵活机动，把我点老本都踢＠光了！”总之，他一切都是对的。他常常下了一道命令，又下一道命令把它改了，接着第三道又和第二道不同，有时一天竟变到一二十回。当他困惑的部下无法应付而叫苦的时候，他反而说：“这就是进步！总体战愈来愈复杂，只有不断的变化，才能提高、进步！”其实，他不但喜欢骗人，还喜欢欺骗自己，向迷信和幻想乞灵。他任命高卓之为东南守区司令，“南”与“难”同音，他感到很不吉祥，硬要疙里疙瘩地改为南东守区司令。赵瑞说：傅作义偷袭石家庄的企图曾使阎锡山大为兴奋，傅匪刚刚出动，他就大力吹嘘：“强大援晋兵团即将抵并。”从地洞底下打出电话来问：“东山上解放军的大炮，是不是转过去朝东打了？”回答不是，他就乱骂：“眼睛长到那里去了？赶快派人去监督哨兵，仔细观察。”于是几分钟之后，由于依照阎锡山的主观愿望“仔细观察”的结果，解放军的大炮竟“调转”方向了。他一听到飞机响，就立即要解放军死伤的数目，匪官逐级追查，最前面的人，明明连轰炸了那里都没有看见，也只得胡乱捏造，这里三十，那里五十，很得意地加起来，已经凑够“八万”，成为阎锡山赞许的奇迹之一。许多所谓“惊人奇迹”，都是这样从那又深又暗的地洞里首先出现，经过电话出去“证实”，再“报告”回来，才“创造”成功的。
    “财迷、怕死、不瞌睡”，赵瑞用这三句话，给封建魔王阎锡山画了一幅生动的漫画。“不瞌睡”的意思就是说他虽然已经爬进地洞，还在终日劳碌，不知休止地忙着杀人，他把各部建制打乱，互相监视，又把自己的“侍从参谋”派到部队中去“代他执法督战”，并鼓励这些刽子手放胆杀人，他杀气腾腾地说：“你们地位最低，但是职权最高，任何官兵动摇，都可当场处决。”冤魂屈鬼真是数不胜数了，仅仅淖马主阵地一处，被“执法”的就有四十师三团团长刘永旺、八总队二团营长赵典章、三团营长张达夫、连长侯崇德等官兵数十人。这就是为什么阎匪官兵士气那样低落，而又那样“困守”、“反扑”为阎锡山卖命的主要原因。现在，他所有部队都被打成了残废，保安团编补上来了，民卫军也编补上来了，他又抓学生、工人、商贩，而且提出“战斗城”的血腥口号。这就是说，太原城从七岁到六十岁的男女老幼，都得分别担任侦察、作战、运输和构筑工事，无一能够幸免。吝啬鬼阎锡山唯独对别人的生命是最慷慨的。只要他自己能多活一天甚至一个钟头，就不惜拿成千上万的人头来拼。他的四十师在他逼迫下扑来扑去，最后整个的只剩了一百多人，八总队的伤亡也非常惨重。因此，赵瑞最后十分沉痛地说：“我们开头决心不够，不敢迅速起义，许多官兵都无辜牺牲了。如果再不毅然行动，只有全部死光！阎锡山的心太毒太狠，剩下一个人也决不会放过你！”
