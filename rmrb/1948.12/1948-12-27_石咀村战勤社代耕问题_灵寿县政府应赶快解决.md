　　The Problem of Substitute Farming by the Shizui Village War Support Cooperative
  　The Lingshou County Government Should Resolve it Quickly
    The problem of Lingshou District 1 forcing militia members to do substitute farming for cadres of the War Support Cooperative is, I feel, truly unreasonable, because it serves those members who joined the cooperative with money. This cooperative also engages in buying and selling, and its members can not only receive rice seedlings but also do not have to go on many missions. To then have militia members do substitute farming for them, isn't this equivalent to exploiting poor peasants? Regarding this problem, I submitted a letter to your office in September of the Gregorian calendar, and your office wrote a letter to the Lingshou County Government for handling. Since then, I have petitioned the Lingshou Government, but for more than two months, it has not been dealt with, and not even a reply has been given. I wonder what the reason is?

　　November 17th
    The problem of Lingshou District 1 forcing militia members to do substitute farming for cadres of the War Support Cooperative was raised in September. Because we did not understand the actual situation of the cooperative, we forwarded the original letter to the Lingshou County Government, requesting the Lingshou County Government to handle it appropriately based on the specific situation of the War Support Cooperative in that village. But now it has been more than two months, and it still hasn't been resolved. This attitude of disregarding the opinions of the masses is wrong. The Lingshou County Government should immediately send people to the village to investigate and handle it, and should not delay any longer.

### 石咀村战勤社代耕问题　灵寿县政府应赶快解决

　　石咀村战勤社代耕问题
  　灵寿县政府应赶快解决
    灵寿一区强迫民工队员给战勤社干部代耕问题，我觉得实在不合理，因为它是为有钱入社的队员服务的，该社还做买卖，社员既能分稻秧，又不多出差，再让民工队员给他们代耕，这不等于剥削贫农吗？为这个问题，我在阳历九月份曾给贵社奉上一函，蒙贵社写信转交灵寿县政府处理，以后我又向灵寿政府请示过，但至今两个多月不给处理，就连个答复也没有，不知有何理由？
　　灵寿县一区下石咀村　贾成节上
　　十一月十七日
    灵寿县一区强迫民工队员给战勤社干部代耕问题，是在九月份提出的，因我们不了解该社实际情况，便将原信转交灵寿县政府，请灵寿县府根据该村战勤社的具体情况，适当处理。但到现在已两个多月了，仍未解决，这种对群众意见置之不理的态度是不对的，应请灵寿县政府立即派人到该村调查处理，不应再拖延下去。
