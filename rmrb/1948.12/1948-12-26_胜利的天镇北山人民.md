　　The Victorious People of Beishan, Tianzhen
　　Sun Ying, Li Bo, Wang Yi
　　On the north side of the Ping绥 Railway, there is a mountainous area stretching over a hundred li from east to west and about fifty li from north to south—Beishan, Tianzhen. Nestled within its embrace are more than eighty villages, large and small, with over fifteen hundred households and more than nine thousand people, who have been tearing and fighting with the bandit Fu in an extremely cruel environment.
　　After the Japanese surrender, the people of this mountainous area, like the people of other regions of Chahar, once lived free and happy lives. But before long, temporary dark clouds obscured the sky. The traitor Chiang Kai-shek destroyed peace, and the bandit Fu launched a sneak attack on Zhangjiakou. Consequently, a life of suffering descended upon the mountainous area. The bandits of previous years became active again, and the Baojing team and Baojia chiefs (at this time, Baojia were established in villages on the mountainside) would come from time to time to demand things and military rations, and people lived in fear. In the abyss of suffering, people remembered their own army—the People's Liberation Army, their own government—the People's Government, and how comfortable life was when they were here: there was food to eat and clothes to wear, everyone could speak, and everyone had democracy. People eagerly awaited their own army to come and rescue them.
　　Last year, in a bright spring, seven comrades with three pistols and four rifles came here—these were Zhang Heng, Li Quanhai, Zhao Shang, and other comrades who had worked here before. They were sent by the county party committee to persist in their work and lead the struggle. They broke through the enemy's Ping绥 Railway, passed through layers of blockades, and arrived here victoriously. But at that time, the reactionary forces were strong, and they dared not operate openly, moving to several villages in one night. Before each departure, Comrade Li Quanhai always instructed people like this: "The rifles are in the front, the pistols are loaded, and those in the back should take out grenades," ready for any situation at any time. In this way, they maintained close contact with the masses. How happy the people in distress were to see their own relatives! They warmly pulled the comrades aside, whispering about the brutality of the bandit Fu and the rampant bandits, and asking about the various situations of the People's Liberation Army. The comrades explained the situation, calling on everyone to unite and fight together to drive away the reactionary elements so that they could live a free and happy life again.
　　At that time, bandits were rampant in the mountains, posing as Eighth Route Army cadres to rob the common people, causing social unrest. Comrade Gao Kun, seizing on the urgent demand of the masses, went to various places to organize the masses to suppress bandits. Before long, he mobilized the gunmen (hunters) within dozens of li and carried out a mountain clearing operation, eliminating the bandits. The victory of this struggle united people from all walks of life around us.
　　The enemy in Dongshan, Chaigoubao, and other places were conscripting men, grabbing anyone they saw, regardless of gender, and replacing women with men. Where could they escape? The masses fled to this mountain, and the cadres united with these hundred or so young people who had fled, weathering the wind and sleeping in the open in the mountains, and launched a struggle against conscription against the enemy, forming sickle teams, and piling up large stones on the mountaintops. If the enemy came to conscript, they would use stones to attack them. Once, the "village dogs" of Shajatun, Dukoubao, came to conscript, and were forced to flee back in embarrassment by the masses with rolling stones, without getting anything. From then on, whenever the masses heard the news of conscription, they fled to the mountains. In this way, the enemy's frantic attempts to conscript had to be considered here.
　　The reactionary Baojia were oppressing the people and undermining the revolutionary work, so the cadres led the masses to launch a struggle to destroy the puppet organizations, and dealt with the evil Jia chief Yang Er.
　　This series of victories enabled us to establish revolutionary order, with sentry posts on the mountaintops. The personnel of the enemy's large townships no longer dared to go up the mountains, and further launched a systematic struggle against the enemy. At this time, the enemy felt the seriousness of the threat, especially that the Ping绥 Railway would no longer be so quiet in the future. Therefore, the bandit Fu implemented various cruel and vicious means to deal with the people of this mountainous area.
　　The bandit Fu's cruel methods of creating a no-man's land began: on the one hand, reactionary landlord armed organizations such as Lian Zhuang, Hong Hui, and Jiu Gong Dao were universally established in Xinghe, Tianzhen, Yanggao, and other places, surrounding the mountainous area; on the other hand, large forces were concentrated to carry out destructive "suppression" of the mountainous area. In eleven months (from September of last year to August of this year), "suppression" and "sweeping" with more than three hundred soldiers reached more than twenty times, with the largest force reaching more than four thousand. Small-scale looting and harassment occurred every three to five days, which was incalculable. The people of the mountainous area suffered unprecedented disasters:
　　In January of this year, the Tianzhen Bandit 17th Division, in coordination with the puppet Datun, Hong Hui, and five hundred people, "suppressed" the Touertai area, arresting people and robbing things, taking away whatever they could move, and smashing everything they couldn't move, such as doors, windows, and pots. In Touertai, seven men and women were arrested, some were killed, and some were beaten to death with sticks. Among them, a female military family member was stripped naked and stood on the ice because she refused the insults of the bandits.
　　On February 15th, the bandits found the immobile old man Li in the Laoyangshugou ditch, broke the old man's legs, and made the old man die in pain. At the beginning of March, the enemy's 20th Regiment in Yanggao, together with Datun and Honghui, carried out destructive destruction in Sandaobian, Xiaoshagou, Tanhuogou, and Jiucaigou for seven consecutive days. People's pots, bowls, and chopsticks were smashed, yam eggs were burned, and kang tables and kang mats were chopped up. Lu Fengchang, the bandit county magistrate of Xinghe, used even more vicious methods, personally leading more than 600 people from the Security Regiment, Security Team, and Lian Zhuang, burning the 40 households of Shiyaogou to the ground, burning a total of 147 houses, and turning all the property inside the houses into ashes!
　　The people who were devastated by the bandit Fu not only did not yield, but on the contrary, shouted out roars of revenge. When some places were continuously devastated by the enemy, and children and women could no longer exist, they moved away, and the men turned the mountain with the enemy.
　　"If we had weapons, we would fight the enemy hard!" This was the demand of the masses, so the cadres established a militia organization. Wang ×× was a famous gunman who had been hunting since he was a child, and he automatically joined the militia. Han ×× was a 59-year-old poor peasant who had been allocated several acres of land during the land reform in the past. In May, he was injured by a bandit cavalry brigade. When he recovered, he immediately joined the militia and fought against the enemy with the young people. There were also many farmers who automatically joined the militia squad.
　　On February 15th, the enemy went up the mountain with more than 300 soldiers to carry out "suppression". The militia squad and the working team bravely launched an ambush, killing five enemies and wounding ten enemies without any casualties, creating a brilliant record of zero to fifteen.
　　On March 2nd, the bandits came again. The militia of Dong × village guarded a mountaintop and bravely resisted, not allowing the enemy to go up the mountain. Although they did not have a gun in their hands, they did not retreat a step. After running out of hand grenades, they threw pull-fire mines into the enemy crowd. The enemy collapsed and did not rush up the mountain.
　　In mid-March, Tianzhen and Yanggao were liberated by the People's Liberation Army, and the threat from the western and southern sides of Beishan was reduced, which further encouraged the fighting spirit of the militia. In the Chahar-Sui Campaign, a struggle was launched to prevent fleeing bandits from escaping, to seize weapons from the fleeing bandits, and to arm ourselves. The militia received a great deal of supplies in the struggle.
　　On April 8th, more than 800 people from the fleeing 201st Division of the bandits fled from the Qianbao Railway Station in Tianzhen through the mountainous area to Chaigoubao. The district cadres and militia, only fourteen people, with seven rifles, ambushed the enemy in Touertai, wounding an enemy regimental commander, capturing 32 enemy rear guard troops, and seizing a machine gun, six Zhongzheng rifles, three war horses, and more than one hundred shells.
　　On April 3rd, the entire 5th Brigade of the 4th Cavalry Division of the bandit cavalry escaped from Yanggao to Kouwai. The militia climbed on the mountain to monitor the enemy, and finally pounced on the rear enemies like tigers descending the mountain, killing and wounding one person each, and obtaining a document and a war horse.
　　On May 15th, more than 400 enemy troops attacked the Zhengshizu area, and were resisted by the militia, who built fortifications to defend their positions, preventing the superior enemy from advancing. The masses also automatically rushed to the front line to deliver food to the militia. The battle continued from defense to pursuit, from the mountain to the river, chasing for more than twenty li. At this time, they happened to meet our main cavalry force intercepting the enemy, and finally annihilated a large part of the enemy. The militia suffered no casualties, and received the praise of our main force, and were awarded four rifles.
　　Now many of the militia in this mountainous area have discarded their earthen guns and are carrying quick guns. From a few militia, they have developed into a tenacious and capable people's armed force with rifles, machine guns, and grenade launchers.
　　Now the people in the mountainous area are smiling, and they are talking with great confidence: "Three hundred or five hundred enemies will never dare to harm us again!" Really! Since the militia drove away the bandit army led by the puppet county magistrate of Xinghe on May 17th, they have never dared to easily enter the inland. Today, Xinghe and Tianzhen have been completely liberated by us, and this mountainous area has finally been liberated, and the people have finally defeated the bandit Fu.

　　胜利的天镇北山人民
    孙英　立波　王一
    在平绥路的北侧，有一块东西长达百余里，南北宽约五十里的山区——天镇北山。在它的怀抱里有着大小八十多个村庄，一千五百多户，九千多人民，在极端残酷的环境中和傅匪撕杀与搏斗。
    这块山地的人民在日本投降后，和察哈尔其他地区的人民一样曾过着自由幸福的日子。为时不久，暂时的乌云遮住了天。卖国贼蒋介石破坏了和平，傅匪偷袭了张垣。随之苦难的生活降临在山区了。历年的土匪又活动起来，保警队保甲长（此时山边村庄已成立了保甲）也不时的前来要东西要军粮，人们提心吊胆的过日月。人们在痛苦的深渊里想起了自己的军队——人民解放军，自己的政府——人民政府在这里的时候是多么舒适的过日子：有吃的有穿的，人人能说话，人人有民主。人们望眼欲穿的等待着自己的军队快来解救他们。
    去年，一个明媚的春天，有七个带着三支短枪、四支大枪的同志来到了这里——这原来就是在这里工作过的张恒，李全海、赵尚等同志，他们是被县委派到这里坚持工作领导斗争的，他们冲破了敌人的平绥路，经过了层层的封锁线，胜利的到达这里。可是当时反动势力大，不敢公开活动，一夜不知转几个村。在每次出发前李全海同志总是这样的吩咐人们：“大枪在前头，手枪顶子弹，后边掏出手榴弹”，随时随地都准备着情况发生，在这样的情况下，与群众保持着密切的联系。苦难中的人们见到自己的亲人是何等的高兴啊！他们亲热的把同志们拉到一边，低低的诉说着傅匪的残暴和土匪的猖獗，打问着解放军的各种情形。同志们讲解了形势，号召大家团结起来一块斗争，把反动家伙打跑，好再过那自由幸福的生活。
    当时山上土匪很猖獗，冒充八路军干部抢劫老百姓，造成社会不安。高坤同志抓着群众这一迫切要求，就到各地组织群众肃匪，时间不长，把几十里以内打山（打猎）的枪手们动员起来，进行了清山，把土匪肃清。这一斗争的胜利，把各阶层人民团结在我们的周围。
    东山、柴沟堡等地的敌人抓丁了，不分男女见人就抓，捉住妇女换男的，哪里逃呢？群众跑上了这座山，干部们又团结住这逃难的百余个青年，风餐露宿在山野，对敌展开了反抓丁斗争，组成镰刀队，山头上堆集起大石头，敌人如果前来抓兵，就用石头打击他。一次渡口堡沙家屯的“乡狗子”追来抓兵，被群众以滚石打的狼狈窜回，一无所得。从此后群众再听到抓兵的风声，就逃到了山上。就这样使敌人抓兵的疯狂企图，不能不在这里有所顾虑。
    反动的保甲压榨着人民，破坏着革命工作，于是干部们又领导着群众展开了摧毁伪组织的斗争，处理了恶甲长杨二。
    这一连串的胜利，使我们建立起革命秩序，有了山头岗哨，敌之大乡人员再不敢上山了，并且更进而向敌人展开了有系统的斗争。这时，敌人感到对其威胁的严重性，尤其是今后平绥路再不会那么安静了。于是傅匪就实施出各种残酷毒辣手段来对付这块山区的人民。
    傅匪制造无人区的残酷手段开始了：一方面在兴和、天镇、阳高等地普遍成立了联庄、红会、九宫道等反动地主武装组织，把山区团团的围困起来；一方面则集中大的兵力对山区进行毁灭性的“清剿”。十一个月（去年九月至今年八月）的时光，三百以上兵力的“清剿”“扫荡”竟达二十多次，最多兵力到达四千之多。小的抢夺骚扰三天一次五天一次的不可算计。山区的人民遭受了空前的灾难：
    今年的一月间，天镇匪十七师配合伪大乡、红会五百人，到头二台子一带“清剿”，见人就捉、见东西就抢，拿动的便拿走，拿不动的如门、窗、锅等全部给砸毁。在头二台子捉住了七个男女，有的被杀掉，有的被乱棍活活打死，其中有一个女军属因拒绝匪徒们的凌辱就被脱光站在冰上。
    二月十五日匪徒们在山沟里搜出老杨树沟走不动的李老汉，把老人的腿砍断，使老人活活的疼死了。三月初阳高敌之二十团，纠合了大乡、红会向三道边、小沙沟、炭火沟、韭菜沟实行毁灭性的破坏连续七天之久，人们的锅碗筷被砸碎了，山药蛋被烧毁了，炕桌、炕席被砍坏了。兴和匪县长鲁凤昌更下了毒手，亲率保安团保安队联庄共六百余人，把四十户的石窑沟烧了个光，共烧房一百四十七间，屋子内的全部财产变为灰烬！
    被傅匪摧残的人们，不但没屈服，相反的却喊出复仇的怒吼。当有的地方经敌连续摧残，孩子女人不能存在了，就搬了走，男人们就和敌人转山头。
    “我们如有武器，狠狠的和敌人拼一拼！”这是群众的要求，于是干部们建立起民兵的组织。王××是个自小打牲（打猎）的有名枪手，他自动参加了民兵。韩××是个五十九岁的贫农老汉，在从前土改时分到了几亩土地，五月间被匪骑旅打挂了花，当休养好后，立刻参加了民兵，同青年人一道打击敌人，还有许许多多的农民都自动参加了民兵小队。
    二月十五日敌人以三百余名的兵力上山进行“清剿”了，民兵小队和武工队英勇的展开了阻击战，自己毫无伤亡的毙敌五名伤敌十名，造成零比十五的光辉战绩。
    三月二日匪徒又来了，东×村的民兵守着一个山头英勇的阻击着，不让敌人上山。他们虽然手中没有一支枪，但是他们却不后退一步，手中的手榴弹打光了，就把拉火雷掷在敌人群里。敌人垮了，没有冲上山来。
    三月中旬天镇、阳高被解放军解放了，敌人对北山西边南边的威胁减去了，这更鼓舞起民兵的斗争情绪。察南战役中展开了不让溃匪逃走，从溃匪手中夺下武器，武装自己的斗争。在斗争中民兵得了很大的补给。
    四月八日溃匪二○一师的八百余人，从天镇前堡车站经山地向柴沟堡逃窜，区干部和民兵仅十四个人，带七支大枪，在头二台子伏击了敌人，伤敌团长一，俘敌后卫部队三十二人，缴获机枪一挺，中正式六支，战马三匹，炮弹百余发。
    四月三日匪骑四师骑五旅全部由阳高向口外逃逸，民兵爬在山上监视着敌人，最后以猛虎下山似的扑向后尾的几个敌人，打死打伤各一人，得文件一部，战马一匹。
    五月十五日敌军四百余向我正石咀子一带进攻，被民兵节节阻击与两翼侧击，民兵们建筑起工事固守阵地，使优势之敌不能前进。群众们也自动的赶到前线给民兵送饭。战斗一直由固守战到追击，由山上追到川下，一直追了二十余里。这时恰遇我骑兵主力截击敌人，最后将敌歼灭了一大部，民兵无一伤亡，得到了我主力军的表扬，奖给民兵步枪四支。
    现在这块山区已有许多的民兵去掉了土枪背上了快枪。由几个民兵发展成拥有步枪、机枪和掷弹筒的一支顽强精悍的人民武装。
    现在山区的人们脸上发出笑容了，都很有自信心的谈论着：“三百五百的敌人也再不敢来害咱了！”真的！从五月十七日被民兵赶跑兴和伪县长亲带的匪军后，至今再也不敢轻易进入内地。今天兴和天镇都已被我完全解放了，这块山地最后也解放了，人民终于战胜了傅匪。
