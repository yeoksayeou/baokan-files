(Northern Yue Electric Dispatch) The people's conscription movement in the Northern Yue area, thanks to the active leadership of party members and cadres, who set an example, and the enthusiastic response of the broad masses who have turned over a new leaf, has seen 14,624 young and strong men formally enlist in the army since the beginning of this month. The first and third sub-districts have both exceeded their original plans. The distinct characteristics of this conscription movement are: (1) Due to the increased awareness of party members and cadres after the party rectification, and inspired by the new victorious situation, they have shown unprecedented consciousness in responding to the call for conscription. Party members have actively competed to enlist themselves and launched revolutionary competitions, becoming the driving force of this conscription movement. (2) The broad masses of farmers have received practical class education in the emancipation movement, greatly enhancing their class consciousness. They all demand to fight to Nanjing and liberate the laboring brothers throughout China, so their enthusiasm for joining the army is also very high. Xu Jiangui, Sun Xiaoshan, and Han Erhe from Jingkou, Laiyuan, said when they signed up: "We are conscious young people. We were the backbone in the fight against feudalism, and we will be the backbone when we join the army today." When they gathered in the district, the district cadres asked: "Are you truly voluntary?" They answered in unison: "We signed up voluntarily! Why wouldn't we be voluntary?" In addition, many young and strong men said when they signed up: "Chiang Kai-shek can be defeated within a year. We must hurry to the front line to make some contributions so that all the people across the country can turn over a new leaf together!" (3) After the work began, most village cadres reviewed the previous conscription work and conducted open and in-depth publicity and mobilization among the masses. In addition to those who voluntarily signed up and requested to join the army, individual mobilization and mass democratic discussions were adopted for the rest who met the conscription conditions. Considerations were given to the amount of labor and the extent of difficulties in each family, and appropriate methods were determined to solve their difficulties, so that everyone felt fair and reasonable, had no worries, and were at ease going to the front.

　　党员干部带领群众
  　北岳万四千人入伍
    【北岳电】北岳区人民的参军运动，由于党员干部积极带头，以身作则，广大翻身群众热烈响应，自本月初开始，截至目前止，全区已有一万四千六百二十四名青壮年正式入伍。一、三两分区均超过原订计划。这次参军运动的明显特色是：（一）由于整党后党员和干部觉悟程度提高，并为新的胜利形势所鼓舞，所以在响应参军号召上表现了空前的自觉。党员们纷纷争先自己报名入伍，并展开革命竞赛，成为此次参军运动的火车头。（二）广大农民在翻身运动中受到了实际阶级教育，大大提高了阶级觉悟，都要求打到南京去，解放全中国的劳苦兄弟，所以参军热情也很高。涞源荆山口徐江贵孙小山韩二合等报名时说：“咱们是有认识的青年，斗封建时是骨干，今天参军也是骨干。”到区集中时，区干部问：“你们是否真正自愿？”他们一齐回答：“自愿报名的！为什么不自愿？”另外有很多青壮年报名时说：“一年以里就可打败蒋介石，可得赶快上前线立点功劳，好叫全国老百姓一齐翻身！”（三）工作开始后，大部村干曾对以往参军工作作了检讨，对群众进行了公开深入的宣传动员。除自动报名要求入伍者外，对其余具有参军条件者，都采取个别动员及群众性的民主公议方法，照顾各人家中劳动多少、困难大小等情形，定出适当办法解决其困难，使大家均感公平合理，没有顾虑，安心上前线。
