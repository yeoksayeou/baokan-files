　　To vigorously support the front lines and facilitate transportation in North China, the North China People's Government issued a special order on the 16th regarding the collection and protection of railway materials. The document stated: During the War of Resistance Against Japan, we mobilized the masses to destroy railways, and materials are mostly scattered in various townships. Now that North China is about to be completely liberated, the urgent task is to repair the railways. To this end, we hereby order all levels of government to cooperate with the Ministry of Communications to collect all railway materials preserved by the people and stored by government agencies, and hand them over to the Ministry of Communications to facilitate the rapid restoration of the railways. 1. Types of materials to be collected: rails, fishplates, spikes, fishplate bolts, etc. 2. Collection methods: The Ministry of Communications will establish railway material collection stations, and local governments will assist in the collection. The locations of the stations are as follows: Cangxian, Dexian, Bozhen, Tangguantun, Machang, Baoding, Dingxian, Xushui, Gaobeidian, Xinle, Handan, Yuanshi, Matou. For the convenience of work, each station may directly send personnel, carrying a certificate from the Ministry of Communications for the collection of railway materials, to contact the relevant prefectural and county governments. The prefectural and county governments must actively cooperate in handling the matter. 3. County and district governments are responsible for investigating, registering, and reporting a list of all railway materials in their respective jurisdictions to the nearby collection station. Counties and districts that are far from the collection station may report to the prefecture. The prefecture must forward the registration form to the collection station. The collection station must also maintain close contact with the county and district governments and send personnel to collect materials in counties along the railway line. 4. The expenses required for the collection of materials will be uniformly paid by the collection stations of the Ministry of Communications. All railway materials such as rails, spikes, and fishplates, whether stored publicly or privately, are strictly prohibited from being bought or sold. No payment will be made for rails preserved in various townships. All levels of government must assist the Ministry of Communications and the collection stations in organizing transportation to the required locations, with transportation costs paid by the Ministry of Communications. The Ministry of Communications will stipulate and provide appropriate rewards for parts such as spikes and fishplates. 5. Material collection stations and collection personnel must not use this as an opportunity to extort or blackmail, nor violate government laws and regulations; violators will be subject to disciplinary action. 6. From the date of this order, the free buying and selling of various railway-specific materials in the market is prohibited without the permission of the Ministry of Communications of the North China People's Government. Production shops and stores must not casually purchase them, and the destruction of railway materials for other purposes is strictly prohibited, such as using spikes to make sickles, fishplates to make铡 knives, iron wire for nails, dismantling machines, cutting off rails for iron use, etc. Once such destructive behavior is discovered, in addition to confiscating all the materials, the perpetrators will be handed over to the court for punishment.
