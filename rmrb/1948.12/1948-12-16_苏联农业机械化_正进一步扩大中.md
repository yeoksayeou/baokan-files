　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, December 12th: TASS reports: Due to the rapid increase in the production of tractors and agricultural machinery, the work of agricultural mechanization in the Soviet Union is currently being further expanded. This season, the land cultivated by tractors is 4.1 million hectares more than last year, and the use of combine harvesters and other agricultural equipment has also greatly increased. In 1948, the Soviet countryside had three times more tractors, twice as many automobiles, and twice as many agricultural machines as in the pre-war year of 1940. This huge increase was made possible by the rapid revival and further development of the agricultural machinery industry, which greatly exceeded the pre-war production level. Many factories are currently producing more agricultural equipment than before the war. For example, there are now ten factories producing combine harvesters, compared to only two before the war. Their output in the third quarter of this year was four and a half times more than in the same period last year. This year, Rostov has completed the restoration of the world's largest agricultural machinery manufacturing plant. In the first nine months of this year, the factory's shipments were already more than the entire year of 1940. A large agricultural equipment manufacturing plant has started production in Siberia. Tractor factories in Stalingrad and Kharkov are now producing more tractors than before the war. The Soviet factories completed this year are producing combine harvesters for sugar beets and flax, and cotton-picking machines. Currently, agricultural machinery manufacturing plants are busy producing equipment needed for afforestation, for use in the 570 afforestation centers currently being established.

　　苏联农业机械化
  　正进一步扩大中
    【新华社陕北十二日电】塔斯社讯：由于拖拉机与农业机器产量的迅速增加，苏联农业机械化的工作刻正进一步扩大中。本季，以拖拉机耕作的土地，比去年多四千一百万公顷，联合收割机及其他农业装备的使用，亦大为增加。一九四八年，苏联乡村比战前一九四○年多得三倍的拖拉机、两倍的汽车和一倍的农业机器。这种巨大的增加之所以成为可能，系由于农业机器工业的迅速复兴与进一步发展而大大超出战前生产水平所致。有很多工厂刻正生产比战前为多的农业装备。比如，现在有十家工厂正生产联合收割机，而战前仅有两家。它们在本年第三季的产额，比去年同期多四倍半。本年，罗斯多夫已完成了修复世界上最大的农业机器制造厂的工作。本年头九个月内，该厂的出货已比一九四○年全年要多。西伯利亚已有一家大的农业装备制造厂开工生产。斯大林格勒及哈尔科夫两地的拖拉机工厂，现正生产较战前为多的拖拉机。今年落成的各苏维埃工厂，则生产着甜萝卜及亚麻的联合收割机与摘棉机器。目前，各农业机器制造厂正忙于生产造林所需的装备，供给刻在设立当中的五七○个造林中心站之用。
