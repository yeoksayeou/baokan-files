[Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region Telegram] Party, government and people in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region are involved in the upsurge of milling and transporting grain to support the People's Liberation Army. According to the Administrative Office, Hebei (north of the Yellow River) counties completed one-third to one-half of the rice milling within three days. Liaocheng and other counties called on party members of village branches to take the lead, putting forward the slogan of "Mill quickly, deliver quickly, transport quickly." And instructed each village to promptly commend the typical deeds and exemplary figures who enthusiastically supported the front lines, and promote the timely reporting of the communications team. After the cadre of Tangfang Village, Fifth District of Liaocheng County, participated in the emergency rice milling meeting held by the district, he convened a branch meeting after returning to the village to discuss ways to complete the task, and decided to mill rice in groups. Then a mass meeting was held, after which eight groups were freely formed. There was only one millstone in the village. The masses were afraid of delaying time, so Zhu Chenghang and other groups went to the neighboring village to borrow millstones. After the whole village accepted the task of 16,667 catties, it completed 90% of it on the third day. Dong Jindouying Village in Shouzhang received instructions from the district on the 7th, and the masses scrambled to receive grain for milling. Because there were only three millstones in this village, they couldn't catch up during the day, so they continued to grind at night. In the past four days, the millstones have never stopped day and night. The masses believe that "Fighting Chiang Kai-shek is everyone's business. The front is winning so greatly, it wouldn't hurt for us in the rear to be a little faster." Wei Shiyi and Cui Kuijin also handed over to the public more than 20 catties of rice that they had milled out. (According to government regulations, 70 catties of rice are to be paid for every 100 catties of grain milled. The rice referred to here is the excess of seventy catties, which originally belonged to the miller). Women are also very active. On the evening of the 9th, the village cadre returned from a meeting in the district and asked to sew 300 rice bags in one day the next day. Zhang Xiuying and Zhu Wentian, the directors of the women's association, completed the task in half a day after receiving the task.

[Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region Telegram] In order to powerfully support the Huaihai Campaign and accelerate the national victory, cadres and the masses in Dingtao County are involved in unprecedentedly huge grain transportation work. When this task was conveyed to districts and villages, the masses expressed their hundredfold confidence and courage to complete this great mission. In terms of organizational structure, it was determined to take the county party committee as the core, organize a command headquarters, and be responsible for commanding and mastering the exchange of experience by three people, including the county secretary and county head. Other county party committee members and chiefs of various sections and bureaus went to various districts to personally lead and control the progress of this work. It was also proposed that in the grain transportation work, the overdue autumn tax should be cleared, and the work of reduction and exemption should be earnestly done. Some villages have now completed their tasks. In this work, in-depth publicity has been carried out, and forces have been specially organized, specifically divided tasks, and given full play to everyone's enthusiasm. Guo Tang, Zhang Qizhuang and other villages competed to be the first to sign up to send grain to the grain station during the grain transportation.

　　冀鲁豫区聊阳寿张等县
  　人民热烈碾米运粮
    大力支援淮海战役
    【冀鲁豫电】冀鲁豫区党政民卷入碾米、运米，支援人民解放军的热潮。据行署报导，河北（黄河北）各县于三日内碾米完成三分之一至二分之一。聊阳等县号召各村支部党员带头，提出：“快碾、快交、快运”的口号。并指示各村对热烈支援前线的典型事迹，模范人物及时表扬，推动通讯组及时报导。聊阳县五区糖坊村干，参加了区里召开的紧急碾米会议后，回村后便召开支部会议，讨论完成任务的办法，决定分组碾米。接着又开了群众大会，会后自由结合八个组。该村只有一盘碾子。群众怕耽误了时间，于是朱成行等组便到邻村借碾子去，但全村接受一万六千六百六十七斤的任务后，第三日便完成了百分之九十。寿张东金斗营村，七日接到了区的指示，群众争着领谷碾米。因这村只三盘碾子，白天赶不过来，夜里接着碾，四天来，白天黑夜碾子从没停过一会。群众认为：“打老蒋是大家的事，前方这么大的胜利，咱后方再快点也没啥。”魏士毅、崔奎进把自己碾米涨出的二十多斤米，也都交给公家。（按政府规定，每百斤谷碾缴七十斤米。这里所说涨出的米，即是碾到七十斤以上，多出来的，本来可归碾米者所有）妇女也很积极，九号晚上村干从区开会回来，要次日一天内缝成三百根米袋，妇会主任张秀英、朱文田接到任务后，半天即完成了任务。
    【冀鲁豫电】为有力地支援淮海战役，加速全国胜利，定陶全县干部群众，卷入空前巨大的运粮工作。当此任务传达到各区村后，群众都表示有百倍信心和勇气来完成这一伟大使命。在组织机构上确定以县委为核心，组织指挥部，由县书县长等三人负责指挥掌握，交流经验。其他县委和各科局长，到各区亲自领导掌握这一工作的进行。并提出在运粮工作中，应扫清秋征尾欠，认真做好减免工作。现有些村庄，已全部完成任务。在此工作中曾进行了深入的宣传，特别组织了力量，具体分工，发挥了每个人的积极性。郭堂、张七庄等庄在运米中都争先恐后，自动报名送往粮站。
