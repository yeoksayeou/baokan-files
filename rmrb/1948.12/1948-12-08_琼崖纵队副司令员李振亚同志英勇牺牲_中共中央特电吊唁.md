　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 6th: A delayed message from Qiongya: In June of this year, after victoriously marching towards Ledong, liberating Ledong County, and eliminating the bandit gang led by Han Yunchao, in mid-September, our People's Liberation Army Qiongya Column organized the Lingshui-Wanning border campaign in southeastern Hainan Island. In the battle, several strongholds of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit army were wiped out, and two reinforcement companies of the enemy from Lingshui were repulsed. 200 enemy soldiers were killed, wounded, or captured, along with the seizure of two light machine guns, eighty-one rifles, one submachine gun, and one grenade launcher. In order to eliminate the enemy at the Niulou City stronghold, which was under siege, Comrade Li Zhenya, Deputy Commander of the Qiongya Column, personally directed the operation and unfortunately was hit in a vital spot by a stray bullet and gloriously sacrificed his life. All sectors of the Party, government, military, and people in the Qiongya Liberated Area were shocked and deeply mourned upon hearing the tragic news.
