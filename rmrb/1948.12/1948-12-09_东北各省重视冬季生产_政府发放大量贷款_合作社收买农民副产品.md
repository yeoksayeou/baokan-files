Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 6th: After completing the autumn harvest, rural areas in Northeast China quickly entered winter production to prepare for next year's large-scale production campaign. This winter, all regions are highly emphasizing rural sideline production. Provincial governments have instructed their respective trade bureaus and cooperatives to purchase farmers' sideline products such as fur in large quantities. Various sideline loans have been issued in various places based on specific conditions. The Trade Bureau of Hejiang Province has widely issued fur loans. To support pig breeding production in Shuangcheng County, Songjiang Province, the Northeast Bank branch provided interest-free loans equivalent to 700 million yuan, estimated to be able to purchase 2,000 to 2,500 pigs. Most farmers in Heilongjiang, Hejiang, Jilin, Songjiang, and Andong provinces are participating in logging work. Jilin Province, due to its abundant special products, also plans to produce 4.2 million grass bags, sacks, and mats, 104,000 pieces of coarse and fine fur, over 2,000 jin of ginseng, 110,000 jin of pig bristles and horsetail, and over 340 pieces of precious medicinal materials such as deer antler, musk, and tiger bone, totaling approximately 150 billion to 170 billion yuan in value. Farmers in the Nenjiang River basin mainly focus on alkali and salt production. Simultaneously with the above production, preparations for next year's spring plowing, such as accumulating fertilizer and selecting seeds, have also been carried out in advance. Nehe County, Nenjiang Province, has accumulated 410,000 cartloads of manure and built 7,000 toilets during the autumn harvest, which can fertilize 40,000 hectares of land. To ensure that more than one-fifth of the land can be fertilized next year, the county plans to build 30,000 more toilets and prepare to establish manure factories in urban areas and the Laha District. In order to avoid delaying spring plowing by transporting manure next spring, the work of transporting manure in various parts of northern Manchuria has been completed earlier this year. As for seed selection, all regions are also paying close attention. The Dezxuan Village of Sizhen, Panchou County, Nenjiang Province, has established a seed selection committee, which has formed groups of people with seed selection experience from various villages to jointly lead the seed selection. Currently, 155 shi of seeds have been selected. Yong'an District, Huachuan County, Hejiang Province, held an agricultural product exhibition after the autumn harvest, educating farmers about the importance of seed selection. Currently, ten villages, including Xinglong and Changchun in the county, have selected a total of 277,800 jin of wheat, corn, sorghum, millet and other seeds.

    Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 6th: After full preparation, the winter logging work in the forest areas of Northeast China has now been launched on a large scale. The forestry bureaus of all provinces have increased their original winter logging plans. Hejiang, Heilongjiang, and Jilin provinces plan to log a total of 2.35 million cubic meters of timber. In order to complete the plan, the forestry bureaus of all provinces, in addition to mobilizing all employees to engage in logging operations with all their strength, also organized tens of thousands of residents and horses in the counties near the forest areas, in accordance with the principle of benefiting both the public and private sectors, to participate in winter logging. The Forestry Bureau of Hejiang Province changed its original plan to log 600,000 cubic meters to 850,000 cubic meters. The bureau directly operates logging of 765,000 cubic meters, and the rest is logged in cooperation with farmers. Currently, more than 5,600 people and more than 5,500 horses in the five counties of Tangyuan, Boli, Huachuan, Jixian, and Jibei in the province have started mountain operations. Heilongjiang Province changed its original logging plan of 450,000 cubic meters to 600,000 cubic meters. More than 19,600 people and 9,400 horses in nine counties, including Tie County, Tongbei, and Hailun in the province, have begun working on the mountains. Jilin Province organized farmers to enter the mountains a month ago. The province expects to log 900,000 cubic meters this winter.
