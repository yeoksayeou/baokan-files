　　Light Shines on Shenyang
    Liu Baiyu
    The Storm of History

    November 2nd will be a day we will always remember. After three years of climbing on ice, sleeping in snow, risking death and forgetting life, the day we longed for and fought for has finally arrived. When the loyal and heroic soldiers of the People's Liberation Army marched through the streets of Shenyang, and when I heard the sound of their footsteps moving forward, I knew it was the sound of victory, stirring up joy from the bottom of my heart. I entered Shenyang, and I saw this first heavy industrial city in China again. I recognized the tallest chimney of the Iron West District Metal Smelting Plant, the road to the arsenal, and the streets radiating from the central square in all directions. And all of this belonged to the people.

    Victory opens up boundless prospects for the people's cause. In April 1946, during the spring thaw, I visited Shenyang at the invitation of the "Military Mediation Executive Department" along with other Chinese and foreign journalists. At that time, the weather was gloomy with rain and snow. Americans arrived with parachute troops, and the Kuomintang's New First Army and New Sixth Army also flocked in from the sea. Kuomintang secret agents ran rampant, engaging in large-scale anti-communist propaganda in the newspapers and firing black guns at night. Peng Bisheng, the commander of the Shenyang Garrison Command, arrogantly declared to reporters at a long table in the restaurant: "There is no such person as Lin Biao in Northeast China, nor are there any Lin Biao troops." How high the arrogance of the reactionaries against the people was at that time! Today, I have come to Shenyang again. In the "Suppression General Headquarters" building, which foreign journalists recently described as "holding military meetings under flickering candlelight," I saw that the bandits did not even have time to clean up the secret operational maps on the wall. What particularly caught my attention was that the map also marked the final deployment of the Liao Yaoxiang Corps in western Liaoning before its annihilation. It is said that this was personally deployed by Chiang Kai-shek on October 15th. In the puppet political committee, Chiang Kai-shek left behind his traitorous report to his American master, Wedemeyer. I hope to send these things to the Victory Memorial Hall so that people know how these criminals did not even have time to erase the traces of their crimes before falling at the feet of the people. And when I saw a magnetic notepad on the desk of a senior official of the "Suppression General Headquarters" that read "The head can be cut off, blood can flow, but the Northeast cannot be lost," I laughed at this stupid lie. History has not developed according to the minds of the reactionaries, nor will it ever develop according to their minds.

    Chaotic Collapse and Sober Victory

    As we advanced from western Liaoning to Shenyang, a liberated Kuomintang soldier told me about their disastrous defeat: "The defeated troops are like the leaves on the trees now." They used the image of a strong wind sweeping away leaves to describe the situation at that time, and the liberation of Shenyang happened to conform to this situation.

    The Northeast, which Chiang Kai-shek and his American Wall Street masters repeatedly called their so-called lifeline, was completely liberated with the liberation of Shenyang on November 2nd. As recently as a week ago, Chiang Kai-shek went to Shenyang three times to save Jinzhou, Changchun, and the Liao Corps. However, the high tide of the people's victory swept in, leaving Chiang Kai-shek with a series of records of fatal blows: the liberation battle of Jinzhou lasted 31 hours, the liberation of Changchun followed closely behind, and the annihilation of Liao Yaoxiang's twelve American-equipped divisions at Dahushan in western Liaoning took only two days and one night. Immediately afterwards, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang staged a final farce at Shenyang Airport on October 29th: when Wei Lihuang fled by plane, because there were too few planes and too many people, the people all over the airport almost crushed the plane. The scene was chaotic. A group of guys sucking the people's fat trembled in the face of the people's victory. When Zhao Jiaxiang announced "Get on the plane," they immediately swarmed into a ball like disturbed flies. Wei Lihuang rushed up, and Peng Jiqun, chairman of the puppet Nenjiang Provincial Government, climbed onto the plane from the top of a jeep, but was kicked down. The plane took off, and the "big shots" of the "Suppression General Headquarters" stood for a day without being able to squeeze in, ending up with a cold heart. When they returned to see, the houses of officials above the rank of Simplified Appointment had been messed up by their own defeated soldiers - the world had changed in that instant, and the sound of the People's Liberation Army's guns shook the four corners of Shenyang.

    On November 1st, the main force of the People's Liberation Army broke through Shenyang from the Iron West District. I will never forget the night crossing the Liaoning River Railway Bridge. Countless people and horses shouted, countless trucks flashed dazzling lights, and everyone was determined to head for victory! Head for Shenyang! The soldiers advanced section by section with unparalleled clarity, hammering the enemy.

    Chiang Kai-shek's defensive myth was completely shattered. At this time, the characteristic of the battle was that the defeated enemies surrendered one after another, because the Kuomintang soldiers were much more sober than the officials. In a grass hut on the west bank of the Liao River, enemy soldiers said to the people: "We are not fighting anymore." Zhou Fucheng wanted to convene his last military meeting, but no one attended. The regiments surrendered directly to the People's Liberation Army. Whether it was the eagle badge of the New First Army or the "Tiger Might" "Tiger Photo" of the New Sixth Army, they were all trampled under the feet of the advancing people's troops. The enemy sent out armored vehicles, raised the white flag, and invited the vanguard of our army to accept the surrender. A soldier shouted: "I am a Kuomintang soldier, I have a gun to give you!" The enemy's motorcade drivers neatly raised a red flag. The tank team was even more straightforward, driving away the commander and saying: "Leave the good tanks to the country!" The country they were talking about here was the first time they referred to the people's country.

    The people of Shenyang were even more sober. They were not waiting, but bravely welcoming the light. When Chiang's army tanks were still patrolling the streets on October 29th, slogans such as "Chairman Mao is the savior of the Chinese people" appeared movingly on the streets. Although enemy planes bombed in turn one day, the citizens of Shenyang crowded the streets, vying to see the People's Liberation Army seize the enemy's guns. The workers protected the agencies, factories, and banks. All the people stood at their posts, welcoming the arrival of the People's Army. Shenyang is a complete Shenyang, which is our first strong impression. On the morning the war ended, people were walking back and forth on the road. The workers of the Central Daily News were wiping the floor, and not a single lead character on the type rack was messed up. Someone in the municipal government persuaded the guards, took the keys, and locked the doors and windows. Many agencies did not break a piece of glass or lose a light bulb. Shenyang was liberated on the 2nd, and on the 4th, workers and staff members registered and reported one after another. There were 190,000 people in the first week. These were not only workers, but also middle and lower-level employees, as well as senior Kuomintang employees, including Kuomintang army officers and "Joint Logistics" system officers, Simplified Appointment officials of the puppet political committee, directors of the puppet municipal government, and technical experts of the Resources Committee system. From this, we can see a problem: even senior Kuomintang employees are not running away. Not only people from outside the customs, but also people from inside the customs are not running away. How fast and great the changes in people's hearts are! Let the civil servants in Peiping, Tianjin, Nanking, Shanghai… know this, let them look at the example of Shenyang and arrange their own way out! China belongs to all the people. As long as they are not the most reactionary leaders, they should not be afraid of the People's Liberation Army. Everyone has a way to survive and work to do.

    Of course, the most moving thing in the liberation of Shenyang was the workers' actions. When the battle was still going on, when the enemy planes were still bombing wildly, they disregarded their own safety and laid the first cornerstone for the people's Shenyang. In addition to preserving every factory intact, on the night of the 2nd, under intense bombing, the workers launched a thrilling scene to complete the restoration of transportation and other work. In the pitch black, with bombs above and landmines below, the loyalty and heroism of the Harbin railway workers combined with the surging enthusiasm of the Shenyang workers to selflessly complete unexpected tasks in one night. A Harbin railway labor hero worked continuously for 26 hours. Shenyang worker Cai Liqing guarded the people's property vigilantly, investigated who was sending signals, and monitored special agents for two days and two nights before and after the war. Under this surging people's power, Shenyang quickly recovered from the war, and electricity came the next day. The residents' electric lights, which had been cut off by the Kuomintang, suddenly shone brightly, and telephones were connected on the 4th. On the 5th, postal and telecommunications connected Shenyang with the entire Northeast. On the 6th, the cold snow cleared up, and trams drove through the streets, sounding their horns. Most of the shops were open, prices were stable, and grain trucks from the four villages came in continuously. The citizens appeared on the streets as happily as if they were celebrating a festival, and mythical stories were circulating. One said: "In the summer, insects were all over the street, swarming your face, eating all the sorghum. I knew the Kuomintang was finished. Look how good the weather is after liberation, I haven't seen it in years." Another抢着 said: "The People's Liberation Army entered the city on the first, and it happened to be Monday, it was really a coincidence, everything started anew." Really, everything in Shenyang is a new beginning, a new scene seen by the reporter during the Northeast War, a clear expression of the general trend of the world and the aspirations of the people, and a great and heroic climax of the great revolution.

    The Bright Sun and Moon Will Always Belong to the People

    A few days after the liberation of Shenyang, at a symposium of technical experts, an expert in internal combustion engines gave a painful speech. He said that he had personally seen Kuomintang officials dismantle and sell Japanese aircraft that could be used for navigation after a little repair in exchange for gold bars, which they put in their own pockets, and use the aluminum plates for making aircraft to recast into washbasins. He said that making aluminum for aircraft into washbasins is the epitome of the crimes of the Kuomintang bandit gang turning Shenyang, the first heavy industry city in China, into a hungry and poor Shenyang. American lemon juice can be bought on the streets of Shenyang, but the best food for the poor is bean cake and bean dregs. In July, Shenyang newspapers reported that more than 470,000 citizens used bean cakes as food.

    But let me tell you something today. An employee of the Xiaoxi District Government received living expenses issued by the Military Control Commission, bought food and walked home. When the old grandmother saw it, she burst into tears and said, "I didn't expect to be able to eat sorghum!" Is this a trivial matter? No, these tears are the tears of millions of people, and these tears contain so much joy and so much hatred! Watching the birth of the new China and watching the destruction of the old China, it is easy to find the dividing line between the two in Shenyang. In 1946, I personally saw seven or eight seals affixed to the doors of countless factories in the Iron West District. This was the "seizure" of Zhang Jia＠ of the political science department, Qi Shiying, a Kuomintang CC member, and Du Yuming of the military faction, who appeared one after another to swallow, embezzle, and sell. At that time, they grabbed Japanese and puppet assets and rushed to affix their own seals, just like in a bullfighting arena. Today, the takeover by the Military Control Commission, which represents the interests of the people, has been completed under the protection of the people's employees and the clear political style of the liberated areas. There has been no report of breaking a piece of glass or anyone turning public property into private property. In this regard, I can cite various examples: in the municipal government, when the people's mayor walked into this brown building, the original person in charge of the agency led more than 130 employees to hand over the inventory, and all the archives and documents were intact, even the office supplies on the desk were clean. The people's municipal government immediately began to work. The workers of a certain factory organized their own factory protection team, picked up the weapons abandoned by Chiang's bandits, and guarded day and night, protecting all the machines, warehouses, houses, and substations intact. After our takeover on the 4th, the machines started to turn on the 8th.

    Originally, there were many agencies and factories in Shenyang, and the system was complex, so the takeover work was indeed a huge task. On the first day of the announcement of the establishment of the Military Control Commission (the 3rd of this month), it sent out military representatives, divided into military, police, financial, economic, logistics, railway, and other systems, from top to bottom, to carry out the takeover. Under the conditions that the people's hearts are with us and our party has learned to manage the country, the Military Control Commission demonstrated an amazing ability to manage the country. From the 3rd to the 5th, the entire city was taken over, the factories resumed work, and the schools resumed classes. The public teachers, employees, students on public expenses, and many refugee students who reported received temporary relief funds and expressed infinite gratitude. After a whirlwind-like military victory, this was a comfortable spring breeze. The old mother of a female worker surnamed × from a knitting factory, who was so hungry that her hands were swollen more than an inch high and her skin was shiny, is now telling people about how she used the 100,000 yuan temporary relief fund she received to buy grain and meat and send her son to Fushun to work. She talked so much that she laughed non-stop. A 麻袋 worker said: "I didn't expect to get money before I even started working, this is really unexpected." Sun, the director of academic affairs of Municipal No. 2 Middle School, said: "When the Kuomintang was in power, we hadn't received our October salary and we had no food. Just when we were in trouble, the People's Liberation Army came and gave us living expenses." After the liberation of Shenyang, the citizens were satisfied with three things: first, the People's Liberation Army had good discipline; second, water, electricity, and transportation were restored; and third, grain prices fell. These days, processions have been constantly passing through the streets, with happy cheers and bright red and white slogans. As far as I know, a painter who used to paste his own works on the window to keep out the cold has now begun to work for his ideals. A teacher returned to school from prison. People not only gained the freedom to work, but also began to alleviate the poverty in their lives. Wu Jingyu's wife, a steel worker in the Iron West District, spent 10,000 yuan to buy more than six catties of bean noodles and happily clapped her hands and shouted to her neighbors: "Come and see! You couldn't buy a catty even if you sold two pieces of clothing before!" Laughter immediately rippled in places that had lost laughter before.

    All of this is a new scene after liberation, like the red sun rising ＠＠. The tens of millions of people in Shenyang shouted the same sentence at this glorious moment: The bright days have begun! This is a true statement. Shenyang, which was founded more than 1,200 years ago during the Bohai Kingdom and has undergone so many historical vicissitudes, has now entered an unprecedented excitement and happiness and has begun a glorious day.

　　光明照耀着沈阳
    刘白羽
    历史的暴风雨
    十一月二日，将是我们永远记得的日子。三年以来，在爬冰卧雪、冒死忘生的时候，我们所想望、所争取的这样一天，终于实现了。当解放军忠诚英勇的战士走过沈阳街头，当我所听到他们那嚓嚓前行的脚步声时，我知道这是胜利的声音，从内心激起快乐。我走进沈阳，我又看到这个中国第一座重工业城市，我熟识铁西区五金炼冶厂最高的烟囱，到兵工厂去的路，以及由中心广场向四面八方幅射的街道，而这一切，都属于人民的了。
    胜利给人民事业打开无边远景。一九四六年四月春冻时期，我曾在“军事调处执行部”邀请下与其他中外记者来访沈阳。那时气节是雨雪低垂，美国人带着降落伞部队赶来，国民党新一军、新六军也从海上蜂拥而至，国民党特务横行无忌，在报纸上大肆反共宣传，在夜里大放黑枪。沈阳警备司令部司令彭璧生在餐厅长桌上对记者狂妄声明说：“东北无林彪其人，也无林彪部队。”那时反动派反人民的气焰多高！今天，我又到了沈阳，在不久前被外国记者描写为“在摇曳烛光下举行军事会议”的“剿总”大厦里，我看到匪徒们连墙上的机密作战地图也来不及收拾，特别引我注意的是图上还标志着廖耀湘兵团在辽西全军覆没前的最后布署，据说这是蒋介石于十月十五日亲自布署的。在伪政委会里，蒋介石留下了他给他的美国主人魏德迈写的卖国报告。我希望把这些东西送进胜利纪念馆，让人们知道这些罪犯是怎样来不及擦抹其罪恶的痕迹，就倒在人民脚下的。又当我看到“剿总”高级官员桌上一只磁制记事牌上写着的“头可断，血可流，东北不可丢”时，我为这愚蠢的谎话而笑了。历史没有按着反动者的头脑发展，也永不会按着他们的头脑发展。
    混乱的崩溃与清醒的胜利
    当我们从辽西向沈阳前进时，一个被解放的国民党士兵把他们的惨败情况告诉我：“被打垮的队伍就象现在的树叶一样。”他们拿疾风扫落叶来说明当时的形势，而沈阳的解放也恰恰符合于这一种形势。
    东北，蒋介石及其美国华尔街主子口口声声喊为他们的所谓生命线的地方，随着十一月二日沈阳的解放而全部解放了。蒋介石一周以前还三次到沈阳，救锦州，救长春，救廖兵团。可是人民胜利高潮怒卷而来，留给蒋介石的是一连串致命打击的纪录：锦州的解放战是三十一小时，长春的解放紧跟着赶上来，辽西打虎山廖耀湘十二个美械师的覆没也不过两天一夜。蒋介石匪帮紧接着在十月二十九日沈阳飞机场上演了最后一出丑剧：卫匪立煌乘飞机逃跑时，因为机少人多，满满一飞机场的人简直要把飞机挤碎似的。当时混乱不堪，一群吮吸人民脂膏的家伙，在人民胜利面前颤抖着。当赵家骧一宣布“上飞机”，立刻象搅乱的苍蝇似的拥成一团，卫立煌连忙抢上去，伪嫩江省政府主席彭济群从吉普顶往飞机上爬，却被一脚踢滚下来，飞机起飞了，“剿总”的“大员”们站了一天没挤上去，落得个冷气攻心。赶回来一看，简任官以上的房子已经给他们自己的溃兵弄得乱七八糟——原来天下在这一瞬之间已经变了，解放军的枪炮声震撼了沈阳四围。
    十一月一日，解放军主力部队从铁西区突破了沈阳。我生平将永不能忘那过辽河铁桥之夜，无数人马，呼喊着，无数卡车闪着耀眼的灯光，大家一心奔向胜利！奔向沈阳！战士们以无比的清醒节节前进，锤击敌人。
    蒋介石的防御神话全部破灭了，这时战斗的特色就是溃败的敌人纷纷缴枪，因为国民党士兵比当官的要清醒得多。在辽河西岸草屋里，敌士兵就对老百姓说：“我们不打了。”周福成想召集他最后的军事会议，却没人出席，各团纷纷直接向解放军投诚，无论新一军的鹰徽，新六军“虎威”的“虎照”，都一齐被践踏在前进的人民部队的脚下。敌人派出装甲车，打了降旗，请我军先头部队去受降。一个士兵喊：“我是国民党兵，有一条枪给你们呀！”敌人的汽车兵团驾驶手整整齐齐张起一面红旗。坦克队更干脆，赶走了指挥官，说：“留下好坦克交给国家！”他们在这里所说的国家，是他们第一次指着人民的国家。
    沈阳的人民更是清醒，他们不是等待着，而是英勇地迎接光明。当十月廿九日蒋军战车还在街头巡逻时，“毛主席是中国人民的救星”的标语，就动人地出现在街头了。一日敌机虽轮番轰炸，但沈阳市民们拥上街头，争着看解放军缴敌人的枪。职工们保护了机关、工厂、银行，全体人民站在各自的岗位上，迎接人民军队的到来。沈阳是完整的沈阳，这是给我们第一个强烈的印象。战争结束的早晨，人们便在路上走来走去。中央日报的工役在揩地板，字架上一个铅字也没乱。市政府里有人说服了卫兵，取过钥匙，锁好门窗。很多机关没打破一块玻璃，没丢一个灯泡。沈阳二日解放，四日工人职员等陆续登记报到，第一周就有十九万人，这不仅是工人，是中下级职员，也有国民党高级职员，包括国民党军队及“联勤”系统的将级官佐、伪政委会系统的简任官、伪市政府的局长、资源委员会系统的技术专家在内。从这里可以看出一个问题：连国民党高级职员也不跑了。不但关外人，连关里人也不跑了。人心的变化多么快，多么大！让那些在北平、天津、南京、上海……的公务人员们都知道吧，让他们看着沈阳的榜样，安排好自己的出路吧！中国是全体人民的，只要不是顶反动的头子，就不要害怕人民解放军，大家都有活路走，有工作做。
    当然，在沈阳解放中，最动人的是工人的行动。他们在战斗还在进行时，在敌机还在疯狂滥炸时，就奋不顾身地为人民的沈阳放置下头一块基石。工人们除了把每座工厂完好保存下来之外，二日夜，在密集轰炸下，工人为完成恢复交通等工作而展开了惊心动魄的一幕。一片漆黑之下，上有炸弹，下有地雷，哈尔滨铁路工人的忠诚英勇与沈阳工人的澎湃热情相结合，忘我地在一个夜晚完成了意想不到的任务。一个哈尔滨铁路劳动英雄一连紧张工作了廿六小时。沈阳工人蔡立清在战前战后两日两夜，机警地保护人民的财产，侦察谁放信号，监视特务。在这汹涌的人民力量之下，沈阳市从战争里迅速恢复过来，第二天电就来了。曾被国民党切断的居民电灯一下耀眼发光，四日电话通了。五日邮电把沈阳与全东北的呼吸沟通。六日冷雪初晴，电车响着喇叭驶过街头，自来水流出了龙头。商店大部开业，物价稳定，四乡粮车源源而来。市民们和过节日一样欢欣的出现在街头，神话式的谈论在流传着。一个说：“夏天满街过虫子，一扑一脸，把高粱吃得精光。我知道国民党一定完了，一看解放后这天气多好，几年来也没见过啦。”另一个抢着说：“解放军是一号进城，又赶上礼拜一，真是巧，一切是从新开始了。”真的，沈阳的一切是新的开始，是记者经历东北战争中所见的新景象，是大势所趋人心所向的鲜明表白，是伟大而英勇的大革命高潮。
    光明的日月永属人民
    沈阳解放后不几天，在一个技术专家的座谈会上，一个研究内燃机的专家，沉痛地讲了一段话。他说，他曾经亲眼看见国民党官员把稍加修理即可航用的日本飞机拆卖，以换取金条，装进自己口袋里，使飞机用的铝板改铸成洗脸盆。他说，制造飞机的铝改铸成洗脸盆，这就是国民党匪帮把中国第一个重工业的沈阳变成饥饿贫困的沈阳的罪行的缩影。沈阳街上买得到美国柠檬汁，但贫民的上等食粮却是豆饼与豆渣。七月份沈阳报纸统计有四十七万余市民即以豆饼为食品。
    但是今天让我讲一件事情吧。小西区区政府一个职员领了军事管制委员会颁发的生活费，买了粮食走回家去，老祖母见了便流下泪来，说：“想不到还能吃到高粱！”这是一桩平凡的小事吗？不，这眼泪是千百万人的眼泪，这眼泪里含着多少欢笑，也含着多少仇恨！看新中国的诞生，看旧中国的毁灭，在沈阳是很容易找到两者之间之分界线的。我在一九四六年曾亲眼看见过铁西区无数家工厂门上都贴了七八条封条。这就是政学系的张嘉＠、国民党ＣＣ分子齐世英、军人派杜聿明先后出场的吞蚀盗卖的“劫收”。当时曾象斗牛场上一样，见了日伪资产就抢着贴上自己的封条。而今天代表人民利益的军管会的接收，则在人民员工保护及解放区的清明政治作风下完成了，没有听说那里打碎过一块玻璃，没有听说那一个人把公物变成私产。在这方面，我可以举出各项例子：在市政府，当人民的市长走进这座棕色大厦时，原机关负责人率领一百三十余职员交代点编，档案文件全部完好无缺，连桌上的办公用具都是洁净的。人民的市政府便立即开始工作了。某工厂工人自己组织护厂队，拿起蒋匪遗弃的武器，日夜把守，完整无损地保护了所有机器、仓库、房屋、变电所，四日由我接收后，八日机轮便转动起来了。
    原来沈阳机关林立，工厂繁多，再加以系统复杂，因此接收工作确是一项浩大的工作。军事管制委员会宣布成立的第一天（本月三日）便派出了军事代表，分为军、警、财、经、后勤、铁路等系统，自上而下，进行接收。在人心向我及我党已学会了管理国家的条件下，军事管制委员会，表现了惊人的管理国家的能力。从三日到五日，全市即接收完毕，工厂复工了，学校复课了。报到的公教、职工人员、公费生及多少流亡学生领到临时性救济费后，表示无限感激。在一阵狂风暴雨似的军事胜利之后，这是一阵舒适的春风化雨。一个针织厂姓×的女工的老母亲，饿得两手肿起一寸多高，皮都发亮了，现在向人家滔滔讲述她家领到十万元临时救济费的用场，如何购买粮、肉，送儿子到抚顺去作工，谈得自己笑个不停。一个麻袋工人说：“还没作工就给钱，这真是想不到的事。”市立二中教务主任孙某说：“国民党在时我们十月份薪金还没领到手，粮食也没有了，正困难的时候，解放军来了，就发给了生活费。”在沈阳解放之后，市民有三大满意的事：第一是解放军纪律好；第二是水电交通恢复；第三是粮价低落。这几天，街上不断走过游行的行列，带着愉快的欢声，鲜艳的红白色标语。据我所知道的，一个从前把自己的作品糊窗防寒的画家，现在已开始为自己的理想而工作了。一个教员从监狱回到学堂。人们不但得到了工作的自由，同时也开始在解除生活的贫困。铁西区铁工吴景玉的女人花一万元买了六斤多豆面回来，快乐得拍着手向邻居们喊道：“你们快来看呀！从前卖两件衣服也买不到一斤呀！”笑声立刻荡漾在从前曾失去欢笑的地方。
    这一切都是解放后的新光景，象红日＠＠而上。沈阳千万人民在这光辉的时刻里喊出同样的一句话：光明的日子开始了！这是真实的话，这一个远从一千二百余年前的渤海国时即已创始、而又经过多少历史沧桑的沈阳，现已步入从来未有过的兴奋快乐，开始了光荣的日月。
