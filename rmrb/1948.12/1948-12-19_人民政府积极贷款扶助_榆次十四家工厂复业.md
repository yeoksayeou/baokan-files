【Taiyuan Branch Dispatch】 Since the liberation, the private textile industry in Yuci, which was on the verge of collapse under the rule of the Japanese invaders and the Yan Xishan bandits, has rapidly recovered and is developing daily due to the policy protection and loan support of our democratic government. In the past, Yuci's textile industry was known to be developed. In addition to the Jinhua Textile Factory with more than 40,000 spindles, there were also many other private weaving and dyeing factories of various sizes. However, after the oppression and devastation by the Japanese invaders and Yan Xishan bandits, almost all of them were shut down. For example, Lihua Company, the largest private company, originally had 25 steam-powered looms and 50 manual looms. During the Japanese occupation, it was impossible to develop because the supply of raw materials and the sales of finished products were controlled by the "Toyo Textile Association." After Yan Xishan took over, the destruction of the factories was even worse: Jinhua Yarn Factory was not allowed to supply private factories with weaving materials, and manufacturers were not allowed to sell cloth outside the city, otherwise they would be accused of "communicating with the Eighth Route Army." Secondly, workers were organized into groups to be drafted into the army (every six people formed a group, with one regular soldier and one reserve soldier being drafted, and the remaining four national soldiers were responsible for all expenses of the two). Lihua Company had six people drafted from ten looms and more than 20 workers, and the workers remaining in the factory had to drill, repair bunkers, dig ditches, and undergo "three self-cultivation training" every day, and the actual working time was often less than half a day. In addition, there were endless levies and miscellaneous taxes, and the factory had to close down. But even closing down was not free. Yan Xishan insisted that you maintain the façade. The person in charge of Lihua Company said: "If we want to close down, the Second War Zone Command will not allow us to sell furniture, so we have to hold on and wait for death." In order to cope with Yan Xishan, seven factories established a "cooperative factory," which only operated 12 looms (four of which were from Lihua). Even so, it was too much of a burden to maintain. If a large factory like Lihua could only close down and collapse, it is hard to imagine how other medium and small factories fared. Since the liberation of Yuci, our party has implemented a policy of protecting industry and commerce, and the democratic government has made every effort to provide loan support to these industries that are beneficial to the national economy, and various private factories have begun to resume operations one after another. The "cooperative factory" established to cope with Yan Xishan was also separated for independent operation. At present, 14 private factories have started operations, with a total of 65 looms. If Yan Xishan had not taken away the generators in the past, causing the yarn factory to be unable to supply cotton yarn in large quantities, then hundreds of looms would have already been in full operation. At present, in addition to the gradual restoration of old factories, new factories are being established one after another. For example, when Wu Zhixiang of Zhenxing Factory was preparing to establish the factory, he only had a capital of 3 million yuan. With the help of a bank loan of 6 million yuan, it has now developed to a capital of 17 million yuan. The factory has ten looms and can produce eight bolts of 30-yard colored national cloth and two bolts of 40-yard coarse cloth every day. In addition, some family factories, such as Tongchang and Tongrui, have also started production, and each machine can produce one bolt of cloth per day. In addition to a few white cloths and towels, most of the products of the factories are various patterns of "national cloth," which are wholesaled in large quantities to Wenshui, Jiaocheng, Xugou, and Fenyang areas, and the sales are smooth, and the supply falls short of demand.

Since the gradual recovery of various factories and family textile industries, all manufacturers have expressed their deep gratitude for the assistance of the democratic government; the lives of ordinary workers and independent laborers have also been improved. For example, Shi Minghu, a family handicraft worker, said: "During the Second War Zone, I was always on missions, and I couldn't even work for half a month in a month. I ate soybean cakes and bran, and I couldn't even afford them; the taxes were high, and if I couldn't pay them, even the soybean cakes would be taken away. How could I survive?! Now I've finally made it through." The workers of Fuxingxiang said: "Now we eat millet in the morning, white flour at noon, and meat twice a month. It's the same in other factories." The person in charge of Xiesheng Factory also said: "We were squeezed dry by Yan Xishan long ago. If it weren't for the loan from the democratic government, the machines wouldn't be able to start."

### 人民政府积极贷款扶助　榆次十四家工厂复业

　　人民政府积极贷款扶助
  　榆次十四家工厂复业
    【太原分社电】日寇阎匪统治时陷于奄奄一息的榆次私营纺织业，自解放后，我民主政府之政策保护及贷款扶植，已迅速恢复并日趋发展。榆次纺织业过去素称发达，除有四万余纺绽的晋华纺织工厂外，其他大小私营织染工厂也为数不少。但经日寇与阎匪的压迫摧残，几乎全部陷于停闭。如私营中规模最大的利华公司，原有蒸汽机带动之布机二十五台，人力机五十台。在日寇统治时期，由于原料供给及成品推销均受“东洋纺织组合”之统治，当然无从发展。阎匪接收后，对工厂的摧残更甚：毁不让晋华纱厂供给私营工厂织布原料，又不许厂家离城卖布，违者以“通八路”论罪；其次是实行工人编组抽兵（每六人一组，抽走常备兵、预备兵各一人，其余四个国民兵负责该二人一切费用）。利华公司十台布机二十多工人即抽走六人，而留厂工人每天要出操、修碉堡、挖沟、“三自传训”等，实际工作时间常不足半天，再加上荷捐杂税层出不穷，工厂只得停闭。可是就连停闭也没有自由，阎匪硬要你撑持着门面。利华公司负责人说：“咱要歇业，二战团不准卖家具，只好挺着等死”。为了应付阎匪，七家工厂成立了个“合作工厂”，仅开布机十二台（其中利华占四台），即使如此，也亏累得不能维持。象利华这样大的工厂尚且只有关门、垮台，别的中、小工厂更难想象了。自榆次解放后，我党实行保护工商业政策，民主政府对这些有益国民生计的工业，尽力予以贷款扶助，各私营工厂始纷纷复业。为了应付阎匪成立的“合作工厂”也分开各自经营。现私营工厂开工者已有十四家，共布机六十五台。要不是阎匪过去将发电机搬走致纱厂目前还不能大量供给棉纱，则数百台布机早已全部开工。目前除旧有工厂已逐渐恢复外，新的工厂正在纷纷创立。如振兴工厂武致祥在筹组该厂时，只有资本三百万元，得银行贷款六百万元扶助，现发展到资本一千七百万元。该厂布机十台，每天可出三十码的颜色国布八匹，四十码的粗布二匹。此外，一些家庭工厂如同昌、同瑞等也都开工进行生产，每日每机能产布一匹。各厂出品除少数白布及毛巾外，大部为各种花样之“国布”，大量批发到文水、交城、徐沟、汾阳一带，销路顺畅，供不应求。
    自各工厂及各家庭纺织业逐渐恢复以来，各厂家对民主政府的扶助莫不深表感激；一般工人及独立劳动者的生活也得到了改善。如家庭手工业者史明虎说：“二战区那时尽出差，一个月连半个月活也干不了。吃的是豆饼、糠麸，还买不来；捐税又多，出不起连豆饼也被拿走。哪还能活呀！？现在总算熬出来了。”复兴祥的工友们说：“现在是早吃小米，中午吃白面，每月两顿肉，别的厂也都一样。”协成工厂负责人也说：“我们早给阎锡山榨干了，要不是民主政府给贷款，机子就开不起来。”
