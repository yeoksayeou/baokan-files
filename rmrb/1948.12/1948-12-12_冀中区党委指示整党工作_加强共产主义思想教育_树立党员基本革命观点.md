    Jizhong District Party Committee Instructs on Party Rectification Work
    Strengthen Communist Ideological Education
    Establish Basic Revolutionary Viewpoints for Party Members
    [Jizhong Electric] According to the instructions of the North China Bureau and some problems discovered in various places during the initial implementation of the winter work, the Jizhong District Party Committee issued supplementary instructions for the winter work on the 14th of last month. After explaining the necessity and importance of continuing Party rectification, it pointed out that in this Party rectification, for branch party members, certain steps should be taken from long-term education to gradually and systematically establish several most basic revolutionary viewpoints that a communist party member must possess: (1) the labor viewpoint that labor creates everything and that not laboring is not glorious; (2) the mass viewpoint of serving the people wholeheartedly and of contacting the masses, educating the masses, and leading the masses forward; (3) the class viewpoint of looking at everything from the perspective of class relations and class struggle; (4) the organizational viewpoint that all party members should unconditionally obey the party's organization, the minority should obey the majority, the lower level should obey the higher level, and the entire party should obey the central government; (5) the materialist viewpoint of proceeding from reality and analyzing and handling problems in a realistic, comprehensive, and historical manner. The instructions also clearly pointed out that Party rectification must firmly grasp the struggle on two fronts. On the one hand, it must be affirmed that the Party rectification policy in the past year was fundamentally correct and the achievements were the main aspect; but it must also be recognized that left-leaning errors occurred in certain issues during Party rectification, mainly by raising the class composition and excessively punishing party member cadres. On the one hand, it should be pointed out that the left errors must be corrected and the errors of resisting correction must be resisted; at the same time, it is necessary to oppose denying the great achievements of the land reform Party rectification under the pretext of correcting deviations. On the one hand, it is necessary to oppose leading organs that do not seriously examine errors and lack a spirit of self-criticism; at the same time, it is necessary to oppose attributing all errors, including corruption, adultery, and moral turpitude, to the leadership's responsibility. On the one hand, it is necessary to oppose punishing cadres and party members indiscriminately with a punitive approach that denies everything; at the same time, it is necessary to oppose educational omnipotence toward cadres without distinction or analysis, such as obvious class dissidents, traitors, and spies. In the village branch, on the one hand, it is opposed that party members do not admit or correct shortcomings and errors; at the same time, it is opposed to only acknowledging the shortcomings and errors of Party rectification and denying its achievements. On the one hand, it is opposed that party members force orders, deviate from the masses, and at the same time, it is opposed to being afraid of making mistakes and not daring to work or passively going slow without leading the masses forward and becoming the tail of the masses. On the one hand, it is opposed to not correcting deviations when there are deviations, and at the same time, it is opposed to correcting deviations randomly without position or principle. On the one hand, it is opposed to extreme democracy, lack of discipline, and anarchic state of branch party members, and at the same time, it is opposed to branch orders and party members being undemocratic. In short, everything should proceed from the party's general policy and general line, correctly straighten and implement policies, and fully promote inner-party democracy, carry out criticism and self-criticism.
    Regarding several specific issues in completing and ending the land reform, it was pointed out that Party rectification should be closely integrated with the end of the land reform. The end of the land reform work is required to be completed before the old calendar New Year, otherwise, the spring production season will be missed. Regarding the organization and use of cadre strength, approximately two-thirds of the cadres can be drawn from each district to work on the end of the land reform and Party rectification, and one-third of the cadres can do other work. Cadres above the county level must also be appropriately concentrated and invested in this work. At the same time, in order to better solve the problem of the unity of departmental work and central work, relevant departments above the county level should draw a certain number of cadres and unify them under the leadership of the Party committee to organize a joint office. Regarding the end of the land reform work, on the one hand, it is necessary to first unify the party's thinking on policies and publicize it to the masses through party members; on the other hand, in specific implementation, it must be led by the branch, mobilize the masses through the new farmers' association, and pay special attention to the opinions of the poor peasant and hired peasant groups. When this work begins, there is still little experience. Each district can concentrate cadres to work on one-third of the villages, and then work on two-thirds of the villages for the second time, completing the end of land reform in all villages in the district in two installments.

    冀中区党委指示整党工作
    加强共产主义思想教育
    树立党员基本革命观点
    【冀中电】冀中区党委根据华北局指示及各地在开始执行冬季工作中已发现的某些问题，在上月十四日发出冬季工作的补充指示。在解释了继续整党的必要性与重要性后，指出在此次整党中，对支部党员，应从长期教育中采取一定步骤，逐渐地、有系统地建立作为一个共产党员所必须具备的几个最基本的革命观点：（一）劳动创造一切与不劳动不光荣的劳动观点。（二）全心全意为人民服务及联系群众、教育群众而又领导群众前进的群众观点。（三）一切从阶级关系、阶级斗争着眼的阶级观点。（四）一切党员，个人应无条件服从党的组织，少数服从多数，下级服从上级，全党服从中央的组织观点。（五）一切从实际出发与实事求是地全面历史地分析问题和处理问题的唯物观点。指示中并明确指出：整党必须紧紧掌握两条战线的斗争。一方面必须肯定过去一年来整党方针是根本正确的，成绩是主要的；但又必须认识整党中在某一时期某些问题上所发生的左倾错误，主要是提高了阶级成份，过多过重地处分了党员干部等。一方面应指出必须纠正左的错误与抵抗纠偏的错误；同时又要反对在纠偏借口下，来否定土改整党的伟大成绩。一方面要反对领导机关不认真检讨错误，缺乏自我批评的精神；同时又要反对把一切错误包括贪污腐化、奸淫伦盗在内，都归咎于领导上负责。一方面要反对对干部党员不加区别一概否定的惩办主义；同时又要反对对干部不加区别不加分析如对明显的阶级异己分子、叛徒、奸细等的教育万能主义。在村支部中一方面反对党员有缺点错误不承认、不纠正；同时又反对只承认整党缺点错误否认其成绩。一方面反对党员强迫命令脱离群众，同时又反对害怕犯错误不敢工作或消极怠工不去领导群众前进而做群众尾巴。一方面反对有偏不纠，同时又反对无立场无原则的乱纠。一方面反对支部党员极端民主、无纪律、无政府状态、同时又反对支部命令、党员不民主。总之，一切应从党的总政策总路线出发，正确的端正与贯彻政策，并充分发扬党内民主，开展批评与自我批评。
    关于完成结束土改的几个具体问题，指出整党应与结束土改紧密结合的进行。结束土改工作，要求必须在旧历年前完成，否则必误明春生产季节。关于干部力量之组织与使用，可从每区抽出大约三分之二干部作结束土改整党工作，三分之一的干部作其他工作，县级以上干部亦须适当集中投入此工作。同时为更好的解决部门工作与中心工作的统一问题，县以上机关有关部门，要抽调一定干部统一于党委领导下组织联合办公室。关于结束土改工作，一方面要首先从政策上统一党内思想，经过党员向群众宣传；另方面在具体进行上，则必须是支部领导，经过新农会发动群众，特别注意贫雇农小组的意见。这一工作开始时经验尚少，每区可集中干部作三分之一的村庄，第二次作三分之二的村庄，分二次将全区村庄结束土改作完。
