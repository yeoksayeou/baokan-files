Taiyuan Frontline Dispatch
   The Battle to Capture the Naoma Main Position on Eastern Mountain
    “Well done! Fought valiantly!”
    When the news of the capture of the Naoma main position was reported by telephone to the command post, the commander's first words were: "Well done! Fought valiantly!"
    At 4:00 PM on October 26th, a unit of our army began to attack the Naoma main position and field positions. When the left-wing troops, under the call of the superiors to "be swift, courageous, and succeed in one attempt," quickly occupied a satellite position on the left flank, the battle on the main position was still raging fiercely. From the first layer of cliffs to the second, from the breakthrough to the trenches, every step forward was a struggle. Li Jinbang's assault team advanced to the trench on the second layer of cliffs but could not move forward. The trench reached its end, and in front was an open area. The enemy, using the resistance line of the upper layer of cliffs, desperately used flying mines and grenades, forming a barrier. At this time, they had to use the simple fortifications in the enemy's trench, dispersing to various combat posts, and holding out until dawn, holding out until the final attack on the enemy. Hao Yuanzhen was wounded in the head, and when others asked him, he repeatedly said, "It's okay! It doesn't matter!" Cui Yushan was a hero who was seriously wounded in the Linfen campaign. Before the battle, due to earthwork operations, plus the continuous throwing of grenades, the wound worsened, and his arm swelled, but he gritted his teeth and didn't say a word. A volley of grenades, a volley of rifles; a volley of rifles, a volley of grenades, with enemy firepower shuttling back and forth, soil and shrapnel flying everywhere. While commanding the troops, Li Jinbang was seriously wounded by enemy fire, and immediately Li Zhenfang, who had suffered a minor injury, replaced him in command. The battle continued, and the ammunition supply from the rear could not keep up with consumption for a while. Cui Yushan had only one grenade left. In addition to collecting the enemy's "gifts" in the trench at any time, he sometimes simply used stones. He kept this grenade until the very end before using it. They didn't drink a drop of water, didn't eat a bite of food, and didn't rest for a moment all night. Some sacrificed, some were wounded, and some of the squad and platoon combat organizations were disrupted. Ammunition was running low, and the long transportation line across several hills was constantly blocked by enemy artillery fire. Only two layers of the five layers of cliffs had been occupied, and the situation was very unfavorable to us, and dawn was approaching, and the troops would be completely exposed to enemy fire. Obviously, the situation was extremely urgent. But our commanders and fighters knew what tenacity was. And they knew: we are in difficulty, but the enemy is in even greater difficulty. The two huge bunkers relied on by the enemy had been severely destroyed by our intensive artillery fire. As soon as we rushed up, the enemy would have to lay down their weapons.
    Five minutes, being able to hold on for the last five minutes, is tenacity! Is victory!
    Lian, the company commander of the assault company, was wounded in several places. When the soldiers asked him, he quickly said: "I am not injured, I just fell. You must bravely rush up and be sure to complete the glorious task of capturing Naoma given to us by the Party." In the continuing battle, Deputy Instructor Wei Baoyuan was also injured. He called the cultural cadre Liu Yonglu to his side: "Comrade! We are the Party's troops, even one person must complete the task! I can't hold on any longer, you quickly lead the team!" Light injuries don't mean retreat from the front line. This was not the action of one or two people, but the conscious action of most of the wounded comrades. "Be sure to capture Naoma, even one person must complete the task!" This was also not the slogan of one or two people, but the slogan of all the commanders and fighters.
    In order to monitor and prevent the enemy's counterattack, and to cover the main force's organization of the final attack on the enemy, Hou Maoshui took five soldiers and sneaked to a place thirty or forty meters away from the enemy. When the enemy threw grenades to the east, they dispersed and transferred to the west; when the enemy threw grenades to the west, they dispersed and transferred to the east, successfully completing the task without casualties.
    With the arrival of dawn, and facing the faint light of dawn, our intensive artillery fire and various automatic weapons launched the prelude to the final five-minute battle against the enemy's position. Deputy Company Commander Yan Juyao and Political Instructor Guo Erxiao, led an assault team, and pounced fiercely on the enemy from the right flank. The brave demolitionists Wang Huangmao and Zhang Fuxiang, continuously blasted through the cliffs more than ten feet high, opening a smooth road for the assault team. The battle was raging fiercely at various breakthroughs. When the soldier Jia Jixiang was throwing grenades, an enemy grenade flew over. He immediately rolled down the slope. After a grenade that landed not far from him exploded, he immediately rushed up again and continued to pounce fiercely on the enemy. The shells, explosives, and grenades deafened his ears. But he still rushed forward regardless of everything. People's fighters with a high degree of awareness know the direction of combat. They can command themselves and can command each other.
    "If we are not afraid of death, we can defeat ten enemies." The lone heroes, stepping on the enemy's corpses, holding piles and boxes of grenades that the enemy had prepared long ago, advanced everywhere, determined to break through the enemy's last line of resistance. And shouted loudly: "We have already rushed up, quickly surrender your guns!" "Surrender and you won't be killed!" "Don't run, you'll be shot if you run!" The enemy wavered and collapsed. Our follow-up troops came from all the breakthroughs. The Naoma main position, which the bandit Yan called an iron wall, was destroyed. The so-called "main force" of the Yan bandit's Eighth General Team, First Regiment, was mostly captured or killed.
    What power destroyed it? Of course, artillery fire is very important; but we should say that the more important thing is the high tenacity of all the heroes of the Naoma battle - the tenacity to persevere to the last five minutes!

　　太原前线通讯
   　攻占东山淖马主阵地之战
    “打得好！打得顽强!”
    当攻占淖马主阵地的消息从电话中报告到指挥所的时候，指挥员第一句话就是：“打得好！打得顽强！”
    十月二十六日下午四时，我军一部开始向淖马主阵地及野战阵地进行攻击，当左翼部队在上级“迅速、勇猛，一次成功”的号召下，迅速占领左侧一个卫星阵地后，在主阵地上的战斗仍是激烈进行着。从第一层削壁发展到第二层削壁，从突破口发展到交通壕，前进一步争夺一步。李金邦突击组，发展到第二层削壁的交通壕，不能前进了。交通壕到了尽头，前面是一片开阔地，敌人利用上一层削壁的抵抗线，拼命使用飞雷和手榴弹，构成一道拦阻线。这时只好利用敌人交通壕内简单的工事，分散到各个战斗岗位上，一直坚守到天明，坚守到最后向敌人的攻击。郝元珍头部负伤了，当别人问他的时候，他连说：“不要紧！没有关系！”崔玉山是在临汾战役中负了重伤的功臣，战斗以前，由于土工作业，再加上现在连续投弹，伤口又坏了，胳膊肿了，但他咬着牙，一声也没吭。一排子手榴弹，一排子步枪；一排子步枪，一排子手榴弹，与敌人火力穿梭往来，土块与弹片到处飞舞。在指挥部队时，李金邦被敌火力重伤了，即时就有另一个负了轻伤的李振芳来代替他的指挥。战斗继续进行着，后方弹药接济一时赶不上消耗。崔玉山手里只有一颗手榴弹了，除了随时在交通壕内收集敌人的“礼物”外，有时干脆使用着石头。他把这颗手榴弹一直保存着，不到最后不使用。他们一夜多了没有喝一口水，没有吃一点饭，没有片刻休息。有的牺牲了，有的负了伤，有的班排战斗组织被打乱了。弹药已经不多，在经过好几个山坡漫长的运输线上，受到敌人炮火不断的封锁。五层削壁，还只占领两层，情况对我非常不利，而且天快要明了，部队将要全部暴露在敌人的火力之下。显然，情况是非常的紧急。但我们的指挥员、战斗员，知道什么是顽强。而且知道：我们困难，敌人更困难。敌人依托的两个巨大的碉堡，已经受到我们密集炮火猛烈的摧毁。我们一冲上去，敌人只有放下武器。
    五分钟，能够坚持到最后五分钟，就是顽强！就是胜利！
    突击连的廉连长，好几处负伤，战士们去问他，他赶紧说：“我没有负伤，只是摔了一下。你们要勇敢冲上去，一定要完成党给予我们攻占淖马的光荣任务。”在继续战斗中，副指导员卫保元又受了伤，他把文化干事刘永禄叫到跟前：“同志！我们是党的队伍，一个人也要完成任务！我不能坚持了，你赶快去带领队伍吧！”轻伤不下火线，这已不是一个、两个的行动，而是多数负伤的同志自觉的行动。“一定要攻下淖马，一个人也要完成任务！”这也不是一个、两个人的口号，而是全体指战人员的口号。
    为了监视与阻止敌人反扑，掩护主力组织对敌人的最后攻击，侯毛水带着五个战士，摸到距敌人三、四十公尺的地方，敌人往东打手榴弹，他们就向西分散转移；敌人往西打，他们就向东分散转移，胜利完成了任务，而没有伤亡。
    随着拂晓的到来，迎着微明的曙光，我们密集炮火和各种自动火器，向着敌人阵地发出了最后五分钟搏斗的前奏。副连长阎巨耀、政治指导员郭二小，带着一支突击队，从右翼向着敌人猛扑。英勇的爆破手王黄毛、张福祥，向着一丈多高的削壁，连续爆破成功，给突击队开辟了一条顺利的道路。战斗在各个突破口激烈进行着。当战士贾吉祥正在投弹的时候，敌人的手榴弹飞来了，他马上顺着斜坡滚下来，等到落到他身边不远的一颗手榴弹爆炸后，又立即冲上去，继续向着敌人猛扑，炮弹、炸药、手榴弹，把他的耳朵震聋了。但他仍然不顾一切的向前冲。具有高度觉悟的人民战士，是知道作战方向的，他们能够自己指挥自己，而又能够互相指挥。
    “我们一个人不怕死，就可以战胜十个敌人。”孤胆的英雄们，踏着敌人的尸体，拿着敌人早已准备好了的成堆成箱的手榴弹，到处猛进，决心冲破敌人最后一道抵抗线。并且大声叫喊：“我们已经冲上来了，赶快缴枪吧！”“缴枪不杀！”“不要跑，一跑就要打死你！”敌人动摇了，崩溃了。我们后续部队从各个突破口围来，阎匪号称铜墙铁壁的淖马主阵地被摧毁了，所谓“主力”的阎匪八总队第一团，绝大部分被俘或被击毙了。
    是什么力量使它摧毁的呢？当然，炮火是很重要的；但我们应该说，更重要的东西，还是淖马战斗全体英雄们的高度顽强性，——坚持到最后五分钟的顽强性！
