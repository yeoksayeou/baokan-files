　　Strictly Examine Winter Work Plans of Various Counties
  　JiZhong No. 9 Prefectural Committee Pays Attention to Mastering Cadre Policy Ideology
    [Our Newspaper News] The JiZhong District No. 9 Prefectural Committee strictly examines the work plans of its subordinate county committees, corrects certain errors concerning guiding principles, in order to unify policy ideology and implement the district party committee's winter work instructions. Before the start of winter work, the prefectural committee, in addition to specifically studying and deploying the winter work based on the situation in the sub-district, personally and with emphasis participated in the discussion and deployment of the various county committees. Recently, it strictly reviewed the work conclusions of the county committees, and found that the conclusions of individual counties had some errors and defects in principle. For example, regarding the issue of calculating the amount and percentage of exploitation, the Shen County Committee concluded: "The total income of the whole family (i.e., including agricultural and sideline income and industrial and commercial profits) divided by the exploitation part (worker labor income, deducting wages and living expenses and the remaining processing and commercial profits), the resulting proportion exceeding 25% is considered a rich peasant, and not exceeding it is considered a wealthy middle peasant." Calculating feudal exploitation and capitalist exploitation together in this way will inevitably raise the composition, leading to errors of encroaching on industry and commerce. Another example is in the conclusion of the party rectification work, the WuJi County Committee believed that " expressing dissatisfaction with the practice of 'moving stones' is wrong. If this continues, it may accommodate and sympathize with the mistakes of the old cadres in specific implementation, which is incorrect." The Prefectural Committee pointed out: For cadres who were removed in the past, one should see if the handling was correct or not. If it was correct, it should be adhered to. If there were errors, it should be corrected. Those bad cadres and bad elements who were particularly seriously wrong and unwilling to correct themselves and were oppressing the peasants were removed from their posts, which was completely correct and necessary; but if they were removed from their posts when they should not have been, it was an error, and should be appropriately corrected in today's party rectification. Regarding the issue of cadres who have left their posts, the RaoYang County Committee said in its conclusion: "As for those who are truly bad and have illegal behaviors, an isolation and strike policy can be adopted." The Prefectural Committee pointed out: The policy for cadres who have left their posts should be patient transformation and education, mobilizing them to come out to study and work; but for those who have truly turned bad, proving that they are unwilling to transform and cannot be transformed (i.e., incurable elements), the handling should be: expulsion from the party, removal of their positions, education to abide by government laws and regulations, and if there are illegal behaviors, the government can handle them according to law, rather than simply adopting an isolation and strike policy. In addition, there are various other issues, and the Prefectural Committee has instructed the counties to correct them separately.
    The JiZhong Guide pointed out: The practice of the No. 9 Prefectural Committee is a very good working method. At the same time, it pointed out: Some leading cadres in the district, even the county committees, still have some vague understanding of the party's land reform and party rectification policies on some issues, and it will be difficult to do the work well below, and even make mistakes, which deserves serious vigilance. It also called on leading cadres at all levels to earnestly strengthen their study, so as to be familiar with the party's various policies, especially the land reform and party rectification policies, and successfully complete the winter work tasks.

　　严格审查各县冬季工作计划
  　冀中九地委注意掌握干部政策思想
    【本报讯】冀中区九地委严格审查所属各县委工作计划，纠正某些有关方针原则的错误，以统一政策思想，贯彻区党委冬季工作指示。该地委于冬季工作开始前，除根据该分区情况，具体研究与布置今冬工作外，并亲自分头有重点的参加各县委的讨论布置，近更严格地审查了各县委的工作结论，发现个别县的结论中有某些原则上的错误和缺陷。如计算剥削分量和百分比的问题，深县县委的结论是：“全家总收入（即包括农副业收入和工商业盈利部分）除剥削部分（工人劳动收入，扣除工资和生活费所余部分加工商业盈利），所得出比例数，超过百分之二十五者为富农，不超过者即为富裕中农。”这样把封建剥削与资本主义剥削混在一起计算，必然要把成份提高，而致发生侵犯工商业的错误。再如对整党工作的结论中，无极县县委认为“对搬石头的作法还表示不满，这是不对的。如果这样下去，在具体执行上，就可能迁就和同情老干部的错误，这是不正确的”。地委指出：过去撤换的干部，应看处理的正确与否，对的就应坚持，有错误就应改正，对那些错误特别严重而不肯改正的、压在农民头上的坏干部和坏分子撤了职，这是完全正确的必须的；但不应撤职而撤了职的，就是错误，今天整党中就应适当纠正。对脱职干部问题，饶阳县委结论中说：“至于真正坏的而又有非法行为的，可采取孤立打击政策。”地委指出：对脱职干部的方针应是耐心的改造教育，动员他们出来学习与工作；但对真正变坏了证明其不愿改造和不能改造的（即不可救药分子），处理上应是：开除党籍、撤消其职务，教育其遵守政府法令，如有违法行为，政府可依法处理，而不是简单地采取孤立打击政策。此外还有各种问题，地委均已分别指示各县纠正。
    冀中导报指出：九地委这种作法，是一种很好的工作方法。同时提出：该区某些领导干部，甚至县委，对党的土改整党政策在某些问题上，至今仍存在一些模糊认识，下面工作就很难作好，甚至犯错误，值得严重警惕。并号召各级领导干部，必须认真的加强学习，作到熟悉党的各种政策，特别是土改与整党的政策，胜利完成冬季工作任务。
