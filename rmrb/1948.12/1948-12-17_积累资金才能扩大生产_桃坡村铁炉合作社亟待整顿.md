Accumulating Funds is the Only Way to Expand Production
　　The Iron Furnace Cooperative in Taopo Village Urgently Needs Rectification
[Our Newspaper] The Iron Furnace Cooperative in Taopo Village, Yangquan, has achieved great success in solving the village's livelihood difficulties through production over the past year. However, there are many problems in its operation and management that need rectification and improvement. The cooperative was established last summer during the production efforts to overcome the famine. All 139 households in the village are shareholders, including the technical workers and school teachers who came to work in the village. Each share is two dou of millet. Before the fourth dividend distribution on the first day of the fourth month of the lunar calendar this year, the number of shares increased from 169 to 278, with a total of 55 shi and 6 dou of millet in share capital. A total of 288 shi of millet in net dividends have been distributed in four installments. According to statistics in mid-November, the cooperative's three cast iron pot furnaces and eleven scrap iron furnaces have produced a total of 20,310 iron pots of various sizes, weighing over 570,000 jin, in the past year or so. The summary of the cooperative's achievements is as follows: First, it has solved the employment problem for 65 workers and staff members. Their entire families, totaling 258 people, have been able to solve their livelihood problems with their wages, plus agricultural income. In addition, it has driven a small coal mine and five ＠ soil kilns, providing regular work for 18 kiln workers. The iron furnace requires a large amount of raw materials (only ＠ soil, coal dust, and large charcoal, require more than 25,000 jin per day). Many people in the village use this kind of miscellaneous work (rocking iron and delivering pots) and human and animal transport as sideline labor to supplement their agricultural income. Based on this (including wage income, miscellaneous work and transportation, share dividend, etc.), the village not only overcame the serious famine (last year's drought resulted in only 20-30% of the normal harvest), but also improved their living conditions.

　　However, over the past year, there have also been many problems in operation and management: (1) Each period's settlement surplus is distributed in full, without any capital accumulation. (2) The responsible cadres within the cooperative are afraid of offending people, and villagers owe the cooperative money for goods and grain, with accounts receivable accounting for more than half of the total funds not being recovered. (3) Extra expenses are very large. According to statistics before April, expenses such as village government spending, teacher salaries, drama troupe expenses, and new recruit send-off fees amounted to as much as 14 shi of millet. (4) Non-productive consumption is also very large. According to the village's custom, the furnace workers' families have never bought coal for burning, and the remaining dross in the factory can be taken at will every day. Since last winter, many women and children have been going to the factory to collect dross, resulting in an extra expense of 1,000 jin of charcoal per day in the factory. (5) The village office and the cooperative share the same courtyard. The village office has no one on duty every day, and people come to the cooperative for meals, to find people, and to handle affairs, causing some parts of the cooperative to replace the village government and distracting the management efforts of the cooperative's staff. Due to the above unreasonable phenomena, the production profit since this spring has not been as good as last year. The shareholders (especially those who only invest capital and do not participate in labor) feel that there are not many dividends to be distributed and are afraid of losing money, so they are unwilling to continue investing. Therefore, the cooperative has to rely on the pre-priced orders from the store to maintain production. This method is not a long-term solution. The cooperative should actively adopt effective measures, pay attention to capital accumulation in the process of obtaining production profits. In addition, stopping all non-productive extra expenses, recovering the debts, strengthening the sense of responsibility of the responsible persons within the cooperative, getting rid of all non-productive extra affairs, focusing on business, strengthening the leadership and education of workers and shareholders, improving technology, and improving production are all urgent problems to be solved.

　　积累资金才能扩大生产
  　桃坡村铁炉合作社亟待整顿
    【本报讯】阳泉桃坡村铁炉合作社，一年来用生产解决全村生活困难，获得很大成绩，但经营管理上存在许多问题，需整顿改进。该社系去夏生产渡荒中建立起来的。全村一三九户，户户有股，连到本村来做工的技术工人，学校教员等均有股。每股二斗小米。今年阴历四月初一日第四次分红前，由去年四月之一六九股增加到二七八股。共股金米五十五石六斗。先后四次共分了纯红利二八八石小米。十一月中旬统计，该社三座铸锅炉，十一座烂铁炉，一年余来共生产大小铁锅二万零三百一十驮，计重五十七万余斤。总结该社成绩：首先是解决了六十五个工人职员的就业问题。他们的全部家口二五八人得他们的工资帮助，加上农业收入，生活问题也得到解决。此外还带动了一座小煤窑五座＠土窑，计十八个窑业工人获得了经常工作。铁炉需用大批原料（仅＠土、煤末、大炭三项，每日所需即达二万五千余斤），该村不少人以此种杂工（摇铁送锅）及人畜运输作为副业劳动，以补农业收入之不足。该村依此（包括工资收入、杂工运输、入股分红等），不但渡过严重的灾荒（去年天旱，该村仅二三成年景），生活还得到改善。
    但一年来，在经营管理上，亦存在许多问题：（一）每期结帐盈余，全数分光，不作资金积累。（二）社内负责干部怕得罪人，村民向社里赊货借粮、长支短欠，占全部资金二分之一强的欠帐未收回来。（三）额外开支很大。据四月前统计，如村政府花费、教员薪金、剧团花费、新兵欢送费等，即达十四石小米之多。（四）非生产性的消耗也很大。该村按习惯，炉场工人户一向不买煤烧，厂内每天剩余之碎末可以随便取用。自去冬以来，不少妇女儿童都到场里收取碎末，如此厂内每天多开支一千斤炭。（五）该村村公所与合作社共住一院，村公所每日无专人值班，过往人员吃饭，找人、办事等都在合作社，致合作社某些地方代替了村政权，分散了社务人员的经营力量。因有以上种种不合理现象，所以今春以来，生产利润已不如去年。社员们（特别是只入资金没有参加劳力的户）觉得没有多少红利可分，又怕赔钱，不肯再继续投资。因此该社只得依靠商店的预价定货来维持生产。这种办法不是长久之计。社里应积极采取有效办法、在获得生产利润的过程中，注意积累资金。此外停止一切非生产性的额外开支，收回欠帐，加强社内负责人的责任心，摆脱一切非生产的额外事务，专心业务，加强对工人、社员的领导与教育，改进技术，提高生产等均为当前急待解决的问题。
