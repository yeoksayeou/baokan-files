Notice from the Former Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu and Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region Women's Federations: Electing Representatives to the National Women's Congress and Convening the North China Women's Congress

[Our Newspaper Special Dispatch] The former Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region Women's Federation and the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region Women's Federation issued a joint notice on the 18th of this month regarding the election of representatives to the National Women's Congress and the convening of the North China Women's Congress, stating: We fully agree with the Preparatory Committee of the All-China Liberated Areas Women's Federation's proposal to convene a National Women's Congress and establish the All-China Democratic Women's Federation. To this end, it is specifically decided that after the National Women's Congress, the First North China Women's Congress will be convened to discuss and decide on the direction and tasks of women's work in urban and rural areas of North China, formulate the charter of women's organizations, and establish the North China Women's Federation. This is an important political task to welcome the new situation of the national revolution. Women's federations at all levels and various women's professional organizations must earnestly and promptly carry out preparatory work. Regarding the convening of two-level (county-level, administrative office-level) women's representative meetings, the election of representatives to the National Women's Congress and the First North China Women's Congress, in addition to what has already been announced by the Preparatory Committee of the All-China Liberated Areas Women's Federation, the following items are now supplemented:

　　The number of representatives is tentatively set at 210

    All localities should earnestly and promptly carry out preparations

    (1) The total number of representatives to the First North China Women's Congress is 210. The number of representatives from cities such as Beiping, Tianjin, Taiyuan, and Zhangjiakou, as well as Ji-Re-Cha, will be determined separately. The composition of representatives should include female workers, rural working women, female students, female staff members, female freelancers, and female staff members from institutions such as childcare, health, medical services, finance, and economics. At the same time, it is necessary to take into account female cadres from the directly affiliated cities of North China and various administrative offices, as well as female cadres from directly affiliated Party, government, military, civilian, and academic institutions, and organized family members.

    1. Based on the population density and the foundation of work in various regions, the number of official representatives to the First North China Women's Congress is allocated as follows (the number of representatives to the National Women's Congress will be notified separately):

    Taiyue 15, Jizhong 33, Jinzhong 15, Ji-Lu-Yu 39, Beiyue 24, Jinan 30, Taihang 24, Shijiazhuang 6, Yangquan 2. For North China level, the North China Government, the North China Military Region, and the North China Bureau will each send 5 representatives. The Experimental Nursery and the Peace Nursery will each send 1 representative. The North China Health School and North China University will each send 1 representative. North China cultural organizations will jointly elect 3 representatives.

    2. Elect one-tenth of the number as alternate representatives.

    3. Matters needing attention when electing representatives:

    A. The number of official representatives must not exceed the prescribed number.

    B. If an official representative cannot attend the meeting, the alternate representative may fill the vacancy.

    C. Representatives must bring a letter of introduction from the original election organization when attending the meeting.

    (2) Method of electing representatives:

    Representatives at all levels should be generated through two levels of elections (North China-level directly affiliated cities only undergo one level of election). Due to the short timeframe, each county and city can only convene representative women's meetings to discuss the instructions of the higher level on women's work, solve current work problems, elect representatives to the administrative office-level women's representative meetings, and, if the work situation and cadre conditions permit, establish or reorganize the county and city women's federations. Then, the administrative office-level representative meetings will directly elect representatives to the National and North China Congresses and can establish or reorganize women's federations. The election time can be determined by each district and city, but the election must be completed by early February.

    (3) In addition to the above election matters, the following preparatory work must also be carried out:

    1. Each county should select one or two large villages and towns (or county towns) and, based on the local women's work foundation and in conjunction with the current specific work situation in each region, conduct women's representative meetings in a step-by-step and focused manner. Organize women to participate in production, supply and marketing cooperatives, and winter women's cultural education. Conclude land reform, democratic rectification of the Party, and other work, and combine this with resolving some of the special problems of women, to create models to gain experience for promotion.

    In the process of creating models, conduct investigations and research. The scope of the investigation can include: the living conditions of women in rural areas after land reform (including the living conditions and problems of military dependents and martyrs' families), production conditions (including agricultural, industrial, sideline production), marriage problems (divorce and marriage cases and progress and existing problems in the marriage system), children's growth and causes of death (including the growth and causes of death of "children of unmarried parents"), and the status of female cadres. The purpose of the investigation and research is to widely accumulate materials and raise issues to seek a more systematic solution to women's work problems. Each region can create clear and concise outlines and determine the focus of investigation for each county and city as a basis for investigators.

    This work must be summarized, and the summary materials and research opinions should be brought when the representatives gather.

    2. For North China-level directly affiliated cities and one or two cities in each administrative office area (whichever is appropriate, choose by yourself), it is necessary to focus on researching and summarizing urban women's work and submit the written materials by mid-January. Shijiazhuang, Bozhen, Baoding, Yangquan, Handan, Changzhi, and Linqing must send special personnel with written materials to our office for oral reports. The time will be notified separately.

    (4) After receiving this notice, all regions must promptly discuss and arrange work, and report the work arrangements and the status of winter women's work to us no later than January 20, 1949.

    （二）代表选举方法：
    各级代表应经两级选举产生（华北级直属市只经一级选举），由于时间短促，各县市可只召开有代表性的妇女会议，讨论上级对妇女工作的指示，解决当前工作问题，选举出席行署级的妇女代表会议的代表，并可在工作情况及干部条件情况的允许下，建立或改选县市妇联，再由行署级的代表会议，直接选举出席全国及华北代表大会的代表，并可成立或改选妇女联合会，选举时间，各区市可自行决定，但必须于二月初旬完成选举。

    在创造典型的过程中，进行调查研究，其范围可包括：土地改革后，农村各阶层妇女的生活情况（包括军干烈属的生活情况及问题在内），生产情况（农工副业生产均在内），婚姻问题（离婚结婚案件及婚姻制度上的进步和存在的问题），儿童生长情况及死亡原因（包括“未婚父母孩子”的生长情况及死亡原因），及妇女干部的状况等。调查研究的目的，在于广泛的积累材料，提出问题，以便求得妇女工作问题的更加系统的解决。各地可自制明确简要的提纲，确定各县市调查重点，作为调查工作者的依据。
    这一工作必须总结，并将总结材料与研究意见，于代表集中时带来。
    二、华北级直属市，各行署区内之一、二城市（何者为宜，自行选定）需将城市妇女工作，有重点的加以研究总结，并将书面材料于一月中旬送来，石家庄、泊镇、保定、阳泉、邯郸、长治、临清诸地须派专人携带书面材料，到我处做口头汇报，时间另行通知。
