　　Knowing that his end is near, Kuomintang bandit leader Chiang Kai-shek, while proclaiming to his subordinates that he will go to Sun Yat-sen's Mausoleum to "commit suicide" before retreating from Nanjing, is actually preparing for his final escape to America. Reliable sources claim that one of Soong Mei-ling's purposes in going to America this time is to take the large amounts of loot she and Chiang Kai-shek have extracted over the years to America, and to arrange for a place of exile in America. Because there were too many suitcases and trunks, Soong Mei-ling maintained secrecy when boarding the plane in Nanjing. According to a report in the Washington "Daily News" on the 20th of this month, Soong Mei-ling is purchasing a large residence in Leesburg, Virginia, thirty-five miles from Washington, to be used as a residence for herself and Chiang Kai-shek. Although Kuomintang officials are vehemently denying this, news of Soong purchasing property for Chiang has spread throughout Leesburg. The news has also been reported by American broadcast commentator Pearson on national radio broadcasts.

　　自知末日已近
  　蒋匪介石图逃美国
    【新华社陕北二十八日电】自知末日已近的国民党匪首蒋介石，虽然向他的部下宣传着要在退出南京以前到中山陵去“自杀”，其实却正在作最后逃向美国的准备。可靠消息称：宋美龄这次到美国的目的之一，就是把她和将介石历年剥削得来的大宗脏物带往美国，并在美国按排流亡的住所。因为携带的箱箧太多，宋美龄在南京上飞机时保持秘密。据本月廿日华盛顿“每日新闻”消息披露：宋美龄正在距华盛顿三十五英哩的美国佛吉尼亚州李斯堡城购置大所住宅，供她自己和蒋介石居住之用。虽然国民党官方人士对此极力否认，但宋为蒋购置房产的消息却传到了李斯堡全城。该消息并已为美国广播评论员皮尔逊在全国无线电广播中加以报导。
