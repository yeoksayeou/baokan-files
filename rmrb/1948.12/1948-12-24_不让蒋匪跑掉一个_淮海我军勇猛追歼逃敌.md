　　Not Letting a Single Chiang Bandit Escape
    Our Army in Huaihai Valiantly Pursues and Annihilates Fleeing Enemy
    [Xinhua News Agency, Huaihai Front, 19th] The People's Liberation Army on the Huaihai front, in this pursuit of Du Yuming's three army corps, fully displayed the revolutionary spirit of the people's army, disregarding fatigue and fighting valiantly. After receiving the order to pursue the fleeing enemy one afternoon, Han Yaoting, a combat hero and company commander of a certain PLA unit, immediately used slogans like "If the enemy runs fast, we'll chase even faster!" and "Even if we run two hundred li in a day, we must intercept the enemy and not let a single one escape!" to mobilize all the soldiers in the company to urgently pursue the enemy. Because the situation was urgent, the soldiers of the entire company didn't even bother to eat dinner and chased for ninety li in one go. In the continuous two-day and two-night forced march, not a single soldier fell behind; Zhang Desu, a second-class disabled squad leader, also kept running closely behind. After a ninety-li forced march, another PLA unit seized the highlands of Songshan and Longhushan east of Xiaoxian, southwest of Xuzhou, scattering the rearguard of the enemy fleeing along the Xu (zhou)-Xiao (xian) highway. After running all night to catch up with the fleeing enemy, PLA units in various locations immediately bravely inserted themselves into the enemy's ranks, causing the fleeing enemy to be unable to look after both the head and tail, and in utter chaos. On the evening of the 2nd, a certain PLA unit annihilated the entire 96th Regiment of the 32nd Division of the enemy 76th Army in Wangzhai in one fell swoop. Another PLA unit, after three consecutive days of fierce pursuit, encircled and annihilated four battalions belonging to the 42nd Division of the enemy 8th Army in Haozhanglou, southwest of Xiaoxian. At dawn on the 3rd, twelve armored vehicles covering the enemy's escape were suddenly blocked by the PLA near Wangzhai, forty li southwest of Xiaoxian. Guo Rongxi, an explosion hero, first destroyed one vehicle with rocket launchers and other armor-piercing weapons, and two other armored vehicles surrendered, waving white flags. Although the remaining nine vehicles took the opportunity to escape, three more were captured halfway. Due to the PLA's rapid pursuit, a large number of enemies had been left behind. The PLA units quickly turned back and encircled and annihilated the enemies left behind. Under the People's Liberation Army's encirclement and annihilation, and pursuit, the three army corps of Qiu Qingquan, Li Mi, and Sun Yuanliang led by Du bandit Yuming finally fell into a complete encirclement at dawn on the 4th.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Huaihai Front, 17th] Chen Yuanxiang (formerly mistakenly reported as Chen Yuanxiang), deputy commander of the 41st Army of the Kuomintang's Sun Yuanliang Corps, who was captured on the night of the 6th while leading his troops in a breakout in western Xuzhou, described to reporters the chaos of the bandit army and his own experience of falling into the PLA's net. He said: "We initially planned to cross Yongcheng in three days, but after walking for two days and one night, we only managed to reach the Mengji area, and suddenly we were surrounded by the PLA from all directions. For a while, the men and horses were in chaos, and they all sighed and said: It's over! It's over! At this time, Du Yuming ordered Sun Yuanliang to break through, while he himself and Qiu Qingquan hid behind and followed. Before departure, fearing that they would be discovered by the PLA, it was stipulated that no shooting was allowed, no noise was allowed, no villages were to be passed, and only the wilderness was to be walked. I and the army commander led the 124th Division just wading across a river southwest of Mengji, and the Qiu Qingquan Corps' cordon behind us started shooting. At this time, the troops that had already fallen into your fire net were immediately in chaos. Because my pants were soaked, I couldn't walk even more. I looked for my guards, but the guards were gone. I touched my pistol, but the pistol was also lost. Seeing your soldiers rushing towards me, I desperately ran towards the Qiu Corps' cordon, but I ran exhaustedly and didn't reach it, so I fainted and lay in a small ditch. It wasn't until someone grabbed my clothes and pulled me up that I realized I had been taken prisoner."

　　不让蒋匪跑掉一个
    淮海我军勇猛追歼逃敌
    【新华社淮海前线十九日电】淮海前线人民解放军在这次追击杜聿明所部三个兵团时，充分发扬了人民军队不顾疲劳、勇猛作战的革命精神。解放军某部战斗英雄韩耀亭连长，于一日下午接到追击逃敌的命令后，立刻用“敌人跑得快，我们追得更快！”“一天跑二百里也要截住敌人，不让他们跑掉一个！”的口号，动员全连战士急追敌人。因为时机紧急，全连战士连晚饭也顾不上吃，一下就追了九十里。全连在连续两昼夜的急行军中，无一人掉队；二等残废的班长张德苏也一直紧紧跟着跑。另一部解放军于九十里的急行军后，抢占了徐州西南萧县以东的宋山、龙虎山等高地，把正沿着徐（州）萧（县）公路溃逃的敌人后卫打得稀乱。各地解放军于奔跑整夜追上逃敌后，立即勇猛插入敌阵，使逃敌首尾不能相顾，混乱不堪。二日晚，解放军某部，一举将敌七十六军三十二师九十六团全部歼灭于王寨，另部解放军一个营，则于连续三天的猛追后，在萧县西南郝漳楼，包团歼灭了敌第八军四十二师所属的四个营。三日拂晓，掩护敌人逃命的十二辆装甲车，在萧县西南四十里的王寨附近突然被解放军所阻。爆炸英雄郭荣熙，首先以火箭筒等穿甲火器击毁一辆，另有两辆装甲车便摇着白旗投降。余下九辆虽然乘隙逃走，但在半路上又被俘获三辆。由于解放军追击的神速，大批敌人已被丢在后面，解放军各部乃迅速回头，将落在后面的敌人分别包围聚歼。在人民解放军一面围歼，一面追击之下，杜匪聿明所率领的邱清泉、李弥、孙元良三个兵团，四日拂晓终于全部陷入重围。
    【新华社淮海前线十七日电】六日夜在徐州西部率部突围被俘的国民党军孙元良兵团第四十一军副军长陈元湘（前误为陈远湘），向记者述叙匪军的混乱与他自己陷入解放军罗网的经过。他说：“我们开始计划三天越过永城，但走了两天一夜，好容易才到孟集地区，突然就被解放军从四面八方团团包围，一时人马杂乱，都唉声叹气地说：完了！完了！这时杜聿明命令孙元良突围，他自己和邱清泉就躲在后面跟着。出发前生怕被解放军发觉，规定不准打枪，不准出声，不走村落，只走野外。我同军长带领一二四师刚徒涉过孟集西南的一条河，后面邱清泉兵团的警戒线就打起枪来了。这时已经陷入你们火网中的部队，就立刻混乱不堪。我因为裤子被水湿透，更加走不动了。找卫士，卫士不见了，摸手枪，手枪也丢了。看见你们的战士已向我扑上来，我就拼命地向邱兵团警戒线上跑，但是跑得精疲力尽，也没有跑到，便昏昏地躺在一条小沟里。直到有人抓住我的衣裳拉起我来，才知道已经当了俘虏。”
