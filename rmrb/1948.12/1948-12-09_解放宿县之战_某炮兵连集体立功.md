Xinhua News Agency, Huaihai Front, 6th: In the battle to liberate Suxian County, a field artillery company of the People's Liberation Army achieved 100% accuracy without any casualties, gloriously completing its mission. The unit's leaders issued a commendation and awarded the company a collective merit. Before receiving the attack mission, all the soldiers in the company possessed an iron will to complete this arduous task. Non-Party member soldiers and cadres requested the Party to test them in this battle and admit them into the Party. On the 14th, the 4th Platoon of the regiment, immediately after entering the position, launched a fierce bombardment against enemy bunkers and armored vehicles on both sides of the bridgehead north of Suxian County Railway Station. Amid the earth-shattering roar, shells rapidly penetrated large bunkers and destroyed the bridgehead bunkers. Another gun in the platoon repelled an attack by enemy armored vehicles with three shells, one of which caught fire after being hit. As the infantry charged towards the enemy positions under the cover of artillery fire, a chorus of applause erupted, praising the artillery for its excellent performance. The next day, the company continued to clear the way for the infantry climbing the city walls. They fired three shells, collapsing half of the Three-Star Bunker in the southeast corner, and then continued to destroy the enemy bunkers in the southeast corner, clearing the city wall's battlements. In this battle, although the terrain was open and our artillery was threatened by enemy armored vehicles, due to the cadres personally surveying the terrain, observing the firing targets, and all the soldiers responding calmly, we suffered no casualties. They also strictly observed battlefield discipline, with not a single soldier taking any of the supplies piled up at the railway station.

　　解放宿县之战
  　某炮兵连集体立功
    【新华社淮海前线六日电】人民解放军某部野炮连在解放宿县战斗中百发百中，而自己无一伤亡，光荣完成任务。该部首长特通令嘉奖并给该连记功一次。在未接受攻击任务前，该连全连战士对完成此一艰巨任务具有钢铁般的意志，非党员战士与干部均向党要求在此一战斗中考验他们，吸收他们入党。十四日该团四排刚进入阵地，即向宿县车站以北桥头两侧敌暗碉和装甲连展开猛烈轰击，在震天轰鸣中，炮弹迅速穿透大的碉堡，摧毁了桥头暗碉。该排另一门炮用三发炮弹打退了敌人装甲车的进攻，其中一辆中弹燃烧。在炮火掩护下向敌阵冲锋的步兵行列中响起了一片掌声，赞扬炮兵打得好。次日该连继续为登城的步兵扫清道路，他们连发三炮把东南角三星碉摧垮一半，又继续将东南角的敌暗碉打掉，并扫清了城墙垛口。此次战斗中，虽然地形开阔，我炮兵又受到敌装甲车的威胁，但因干部亲自察看地形，观察射击目标，全体战士沉着应战，因此我无一伤亡。他们并严守战场纪律，没有一个战士去动用火车站上堆积着的物资。
