　　Jiluyu Industrial Bureau Machine Factory
　　Several Experiences in Adjusting Wages

　　[Jiluyu News] Before the Shijiazhuang Conference, the wages of workers in the Machine Factory of the Jiluyu Administrative Office of Industry were divided into three grades and nine levels. Apprentice craftsmen were divided into two levels, and apprentices were divided into four grades and seven levels. Wages were also divided into high and low lines, which were handled according to the worker's activeness and efficiency (the specific amounts in meters for each level are omitted). In the past, the evaluation of grades was based on political, labor, seniority, and technical standards, so like other factories, there was a tendency towards excessively high wages and egalitarianism. Since the Shijiazhuang Conference, wage adjustments have begun in accordance with the new spirit to correct the wage policy. The implementation process can be divided into three stages: (1) In-depth understanding of the workers' situation, focusing on understanding the workers' reactions to the adjustment of the original wages; (2) Studying documents to clear up thinking; (3) Evaluating grades according to the new spirit. In the understanding stage, workers of the second grade and above had no major opinions, because their wages were not much lower than before, and if they worked hard after the implementation of contracting work, their wages would still be about the same. Those who had opinions were workers of the third grade and below, especially apprentices. According to the adjusted wages, they would be reduced from 340 catties or 200 catties (170 catties after the merit campaign) to 140 catties to 110 catties (28 or even 22 "deng"). After studying, the general staff believed that the past wages were too high. For example, a two-year apprentice craftsman, Xiang Qinghe, could support two to three people, and a new apprentice could send about 100 yuan in new currency home in the first month of joining the factory. This was not conducive to developing production and prospering the economy. Moreover, it cultivated lazy thinking among the workers, such as "whether you work or not, it's only two and a half catties," "whether you learn or not, you have food and clothing, so what are you afraid of," and "mixing years to count grades," which did not emphasize technology and production. In addition, the leadership's past rewards and punishments were unclear, and no attendance and work assessment system was established. There was bureaucracy, and the workers' situation was not understood in a timely manner. Good workers were not praised in a timely manner, and bad workers were not criticized. Some workers thought that they were earning so much money anyway. As a result, the workers' enthusiasm for production could not be improved.

　　In the study, although the above deviations were examined, most workers were unwilling to implement the new system. They doubted whether their lives would be guaranteed. How much lower was this amount of money compared to the past wages? Could they contract work? How would contracting work compare to the past wages? Therefore, they generally waited and watched with low morale. After repeated explanations, emphasizing support for the war and future contracting methods and worker benefits, and linking it to the spirit of serving the people demonstrated by many comrades during last year's merit and contribution campaign, they gradually cleared up their thinking and began to implement the new system. The following are a few experiences in implementation: (1) The leadership initially considered the difficulties too much and was not bold in their work. They felt that the apprentices' wages were too low to maintain their lives. Later, the superior (Industrial Bureau) insisted on implementing it. The comrades in the factory felt that the higher-ups were pushing down, and the lower-level were also pushing down. In fact, this was an irresponsible attitude towards work. Therefore, in the implementation, there was insufficient patience in persuasion, and they compulsively took out the draft of the North China Industrial Conference and read it out. The cadres said: "This is clearly stipulated, it is impossible not to implement it, this is an order." The workers said: "If it is an order, then we have nothing to say!?" (2) The workers' emotions were underestimated, and the individual's dissatisfaction with the new system and making trouble was regarded as general. In fact, the main dissatisfied people were the new workers of the third grade and below, because some of them came to support their families, only hearing that the wages here were high, especially the impact on the furnace and fitter departments was the greatest. But this was not general, and the active aspect of the workers was not recognized. In fact, the workers have a glorious tradition of resolutely fighting to the end for the class and for the revolution. As long as we patiently explain the truth and come up with solutions, they will be happy to accept it. For example, we implemented piece-rate pay, established a cooperative (in terms of worker welfare, in addition to health, life, and health guarantees, it is the cooperative family production. Under the guarantee of the Party, the cooperative's articles of association were discussed, and after being approved by the Industrial Bureau, it was started, and profits were obtained, which solved the difficulties), and everyone's morale was high again. (3) There were also problems in the assessment of grades. Simply using the level of technology as the standard, and the technology itself did not have a certain standard discussed. In the class evaluation, it was generally high praise, and everyone wanted to be a good person, and there was no debate, because the leadership did not clarify the evaluation principles in a timely manner, so it formed a laissez-faire attitude. At the meeting of cadres above the squad leader, it was lowered again. The attitude towards labor and the contribution to production were not included in the conditions for assessing grades.

　　In short, before implementing the new system, sufficient preparation should be made, and all issues in the implementation should be considered from multiple perspectives. Solving the wage problem should not only focus on wages. Related management, worker welfare, wage payment methods, etc. should all be considered together. In the implementation, all personnel should be ideologically mature, and there should be no acute illness, eager for success. The policy should be truly understood by the workers. After implementation, in addition to ensuring worker welfare and solving family production, attendance and work assessment should be established, and piece-rate contracting should be implemented practically and reasonably. Piece-rate contracting must have complete tools, sufficient raw materials, correct quality standards, and establish an inspection system. According to accurate production volume, the wage standard for contracting should be established.

　　冀鲁豫工业处机器工厂
  　调整工资的几点体验
    【冀鲁豫讯】冀鲁豫行署工业处机器厂，在石家庄会议前，工人工资是分三等九级，见习工匠分两级，学徒分四等七级，工资中又分高低线，根据工作积极与否及效率大小来处理高低线（各等级以米计算详数略），过去评定等级是以政治、劳动、工龄、技术的标准，所以和其他工厂一样，存在着工资过高与平均主义偏向。自石家庄会议后，便开始按照新精神，调整工资，端正工资政策。执行过程，可以分为三个阶段：（一）深入了解工人情况，着重了解工人对调整原工资的反映；（二）学习文件打通思想；（三）根据新精神评议等级。在了解中，二等工人以上的是没啥意见，因为他们比过去工资低不多，将来再实行包工，自己工作一努力，工资仍差不多。有意见的是三等以下的工人，特别是学徒，按调整工资计算，他们便从三百四十斤或二百斤（立功运动后一百七十斤）降到一百四十斤至一百一十斤（二十八个甚至二十二个等）。经过学习后，一般的职工认为过去工资过高，如二年见习工匠项清和可养两口到三口人有余，新徒入厂当月即可往家捎新币百元左右，这样对发展生产繁荣经济是不利的。而且在工人中养成了“干不干二斤半”、“学不学有吃有穿怕啥”、“混年头数等级”等等不重视技术与生产的懒汉思想。又加上领导上过去赏罚不明，考勤考工未建立，存在着官僚主义的作风，未及时了解工人情况，好的没及时表扬，坏的也未批评。有的工人认为反正是挣那么多的钱。结果不能提高工人对生产的积极性。
    在学习中，虽对以上偏向作了检查，但大部分工人不愿执行新制度，他们怀疑生活是否有保证？这个钱数与过去工资比较究竟降低多少？是否能包工？包工比过去工资究竟又怎样？因此他们一般的等待观望，情绪低落。后经过再三解释，强调支援战争及今后包工与工人的福利办法，更联系去年立功献金时不少同志表现了为人民服务的精神，这样才逐渐打通了思想，开始执行新制度。以下是在执行中的几点体会：（一）领导上开始对困难考虑过多，工作上不大胆，觉着学徒工资太低，不好维持生活。后来上级（工业处）一定叫贯彻，厂的同志认为上边往下推，下边也往下推，实际上这是对工作不负责任的态度。所以在贯彻中就表现了耐心说服不够，带着强迫性地拿华北工业会议的草案出来念，干部说：“这是明文规定，不执行不中，这就是命令。”工人说：“命令我们就没有啥说啦！？”（二）对工人情绪估计不足，把个别对新制度不满，闹情绪的当成一般的。其实不满的主要是才来的三等工人以下的，因为他们来时有的为了养家，光听这里工资高，特别是烘炉钳工两部门影响最大，但这不是一般的，没有认识到工人的积极方面。实际上工人有为阶级为革命坚决斗争到底的光荣传统，只要我们耐心的讲明道理，想出办法，他们是乐于接受的。如我们执行了按件计值，成立了合作社（在工人福利方面，除开卫生、生活、健康保证外，即是合作社家属生产，在党的保证下讨论了合作社的章程，经工业处批准搞起来后，得到了利润，解决了困难），大家情绪又高涨起来。（三）评定等级时也有毛病，单纯用技术高低作标准，而技术本身没有讨论出一定的标准。在班里评议一般是高抬，互相落好人，未展开争论，因为领导上未及时明确评定原则，所以形成自流。到班长以上干部会上，又被降下来，评定中没有把劳动态度，对生产贡献等列入评定等级的条件中。
    总之，在执行新制度前，应作好充分的准备工作，应多方面地考虑到执行中的一切问题。解决工资问题不能单纯从工资上着眼，有关经营管理、工人福利、工资支付方法等都应当一块考虑。在执行中，应使一切人员思想成熟，不应犯急性病，急于求成，政策应真正为工人所领会，执行后除一定搞好工人福利、解决家属生产外，应建立考工考勤，切实合理地执行计件包工。计件包工中一定要有完好的工具，足够的原料，正确的质量标准，并建立检查制度，根据准确的生产量，定立包工的工资标准。
