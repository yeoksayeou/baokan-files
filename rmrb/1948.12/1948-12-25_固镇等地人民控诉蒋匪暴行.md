　　Xinhua News Agency, Huaihai Front, 19th. People in Guzhen Station and other places on the southern section of the Jinpu Railway are complaining about the brutal atrocities of the Jiang bandit Li Yannian Corps when they fled south on the 25th of last month, demanding that the People's Liberation Army eliminate the harm for the people as soon as possible. One-fifth of the houses in Guzhen have been burned down by the enemy, and hundreds of shops have been looted. More than 30,000 tons of goods stored by dozens of grain and tobacco merchants from Beijing and Shanghai at the station have also been mostly looted. The houses on the street from the northeast to the south station bridgehead, about three miles long, were all burned down, with a choking smell of burning. An old man next to the station said: When the Li bandits were about to flee, they piled grass at the door and burned it, and many people were burned alive. The disaster-stricken people in Zhong Gujia Village, northwest of Guzhen, surrounded the People's Liberation Army workers and cried about the atrocities of the Jiang bandits. The wife of farmer Zhen Dianfu in the village said: "The thirteen- or fourteen-year-old girls and the sixty- or seventy-year-old old women in our village have been violated by the Jiang bandits! The People's Liberation Army must avenge us!" The front and back Chen Villages south of Guzhen were looted by the Jiang bandits, and all the women in the village were gang-raped. The People's Liberation Army is now comforting the victims.

　　固镇等地人民控诉蒋匪暴行
    【新华社淮海前线十九日电】津浦路南段固镇车站等地人民，纷纷控诉蒋匪李延年兵团于上月廿五日向南溃逃时的残暴兽行，要求解放军早日为民除害。固镇现已有五分之一房屋遭敌纵火焚毁，数百家商店均遭抢掠，京沪数十家粮烟商存放在车站上的三万余吨货物也大部被抢。镇东北到南车站桥头长约三里的街面房屋全被焚毁，焦臭扑鼻。车站旁一个老乡说：李匪临逃时，把草堆在门口堵着烧，很多人被活活烧死。固镇西北中顾家村受灾人民围着解放军工作员哭诉蒋匪暴行，该村农民阵殿福的妻子说：“俺庄十三四岁的小闺女和六七十岁的老太婆，都被蒋匪糟蹋啦！解放军要给俺们报仇呀！”固镇以南的前后陈庄，被蒋匪洗劫一空，全庄妇女亦遭轮奸，现解放军对灾民正进行安抚中。
