　　Are tax deductions allowed for calves and donkeys?
    Question: When collecting agricultural taxes this year, superiors stipulated that no tax deductions would be given for calves and donkeys. However, some people say: large livestock can have tax deductions, but small livestock are not given tax deductions and people have to be hired to raise them, paid wages, and fed. Where does the money for these expenses come from?
  　　　　　Qí Yànhái, Niúchuān Village, Second District, Héshùn
    Answer: The North China People's Government's new tax regulations stipulate that: for draft animals mainly used in agriculture, and their offspring; each head of cattle or donkey can deduct four *shì* (市) *dǒu* (斗) of grain, and each mule or horse can deduct seven *shì dǒu* of grain. All levels of government should act according to the tax regulations. If the agricultural tax collection in Niúchuān Village, Second District, Héshùn does not allow deductions for small livestock expenses, whether this is the case for the entire county, or only this village is incorrectly implementing the policy, it should be corrected in a timely manner and act in accordance with the new tax regulations.

　　小牛小驴扣除免税点吗？
    问：在今年征公粮时，上级规定不给小牛小驴除免税点，但是有些群众说：大牲口能除免税点，小牲口不给除免税点还要雇人收养，出工资，还要吃料，这些消耗可从哪里来？
  　　　　　和顺二区牛川村　祁彦孩
    答：华北人民政府新税则规定：以农业为主之耕畜，及其所生之幼畜；牛驴每头扣除四市斗谷，骡马每头扣除七市斗谷，各级政府就应该根据税则办事。和顺二区牛川村征农业税不给小牲口除消耗，不论是全县都是这样作，或只有该村执行错了，都应及时纠正，依照薪税则办事才对。
