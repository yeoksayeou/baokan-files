　　Plant the Banner of Victory on the East Mountain Fortress of Taiyuan
    ——A Record of Li Haishui's Company's Battle to Capture Mountain Strongholds
    Bing Ru
    On October 26th, after our breakthrough of the enemy's southern line of the North Camp Fortress, the general offensive against the heavily fortified mountain strongholds in the East Mountain area began. Political Commissar Chen of a certain regiment, holding high the "Victory" red flag sent by the brigade party committee, called upon the commanders and fighters of the main attack force: "In the trench battles of the Linfen campaign, our Li Haishui Hero Company emerged, becoming a glorious banner for the entire column. This time, in coordination with fraternal units to capture the East Mountain inner defense line, we must carry forward Comrade Li Haishui's heroic, resourceful, tenacious, and mutually supportive fighting style. Plant the banner of victory on the mountain stronghold!" Before the attack began, the heroes of the Li Haishui Company were full of confidence, determined to raise high the glorious banner of the Haishui Company's invincibility in the battle to capture Taiyuan.

    At that time, the valley-shaking artillery fire opened the prelude to the full-line offensive. Our artillery group, hidden on the mountain ridges, fiercely bombarded the pillbox on the right wing of the Danao Mountain and the hidden bunker. The smoke and dust from the exploding shells covered several hillside bunkers. Regiment Commander Ran discovered in the observation post that most of the enemy's forward strongholds had been destroyed, and immediately ordered the 7th and 8th companies to launch an assault. He said concisely and forcefully: "Which company will act swiftly and bravely to plant the red flag on the fortress position?"

    The bugle call for the charge sounded from the forward position. The warriors of the 8th Company quickly seized three hidden bunkers on the forward earth bank and attacked the pillbox on the right wing along the western ridge. The heroes of the Li Haishui Company's assault team, taking advantage of the smoke from the enemy's explosions, charged up a slope and went straight for the East-West Plum Blossom Pillbox group position. Eighth Squad Leader, a People's Hero, led the assault team like a whirlwind to the edge of the outer moat. Liu Zhishan shouted that there were enemies in the hidden bunker and threw a grenade into the bunker, causing an explosion. Feng Mao Hai, the head of the combat mutual aid group, was only eighteen years old. He reached out his hand and couldn't touch the edge of the outer moat. He erected a human ladder and climbed up. Feng and Liu also crossed the barbed wire of the chevaux-de-frise, advancing shoulder to shoulder, and captured the opening in the enemy's southeastern corner of the combat works. In the field positions of the Yan bandit army, several incendiary bombs were fired, burning all the dry grass in front of the works, and a pale green fire dragon rose halfway up the mountain. Machine gunner Wang Wei used the light of the fire to raise his gun and cover the advance of the assault group.

    The battle was fiercely fought on the main position on the mountaintop.

    Feng Mao Hai rushed to the front of the earth slope to observe the enemy's situation and give Liu Zhishan specific command of the attack target. Three bandits fired a row of grenades from the traffic trench shelter. Mao Hai picked them up and returned them to the enemy. The last one spun around right in front of his eyes. He kicked it into a blast shelter. Taking advantage of the situation, he threw a grenade, killing one bandit. The other two surrendered in front of his bayonet. However, at this time, the enemy in the crisscrossing field works on the earth bank continued to fire grenades at them. Liu Zhishan discovered that the enemy had to expose their bodies to throw grenades, so Mao Hai and Lao Liu divided the work, one throwing grenades while the other specialized in shooting, suppressing the enemy's firepower and consolidating the breach position.

    It was dusk, and follow-up troops were building positions in front of the outer moat. The enemy still counterattacked Mao Hai and them from both wings to the field positions. In a critical situation, Yan Shengchun of the Sixth Squad came over from the right-wing position. They picked up a box of hand grenades abandoned by the enemy during the retreat. The three immediately carried out trench mutual aid. Yan Shengchun was strong and threw the grenades far. Mao Hai pointed out the grenade targets, and Lao Liu helped to open the lids. Wherever Mao Hai pointed, he hit. They cooperated closely and eliminated the resistance of the enemy in the field positions on the earth bank. Feng Mao Hai's combat team, like an iron fist, grabbed the enemy's throat, covering the Ninth Company's follow-up troops inserting deep, breaking up the enemy's group positions. Then, Comrade Zhang Lianrong from the same group also came (at this time, Yan Shengchun returned to the Sixth Squad's establishment), and they continued to search forward. From a prisoner, they learned that a regiment of the enemy's forces had suffered more than half of its casualties and had begun to retreat. Feng Mao Hai immediately encouraged everyone: We must carry forward Comrade Li Haishui's spirit of battlefield mutual assistance and tenacious combat, "We must not let the enemy retreat, we must completely eliminate them." He immediately designated Zhang Lianrong to monitor the enemy in front and led Liu Zhishan to continue the attack. They passed through the field works and met the blasting group led by Deputy Zhang Youdong of the Eighth Squad near several hidden holes in the Meishan Pillbox. In the pitch-black night sky, the comrades of the blasting group relied on the light from their grenade throws to scout the road. After continuous blasting, the heroes of the Haishui Company's assault team defeated ten times more enemies and finally captured all of the Plum Blossom Pillbox group position.

    The heroes of the Eighth Squad assault team of the Haishui Company were the first to climb the mountaintop fortress and immediately unfurled the "Victory" red flag and planted it on the mountaintop fortress. They looked down at the dim lights of the isolated city of Taiyuan at the foot of the East Mountain and let out a victory cheer. The regimental party committee received the news from the phone that the Haishui Company assault team was the first to seize the Meihua main pillbox group position. They believed that the heroes of the Haishui Company, in the siege battle, implemented Commander Xu's tactical instructions of "brave, tenacious, bold, and agile," and carried forward Comrade Li Haishui's excellent fighting style of resourceful, tenacious, mutual assistance, and division of labor. The decision was made to award a collective meritorious service. Feng Mao Hai, Zhang Lianrong, Yan Zhongzuo, and other people's heroes who captured the mountaintop fortress were honorably admitted to the Party on the front line with the recommendation of the masses and approval of the regimental party committee!

　　把胜利的旗帜插到太原东山要塞上
    ——记李海水连攻占山头要塞之战
    冰如
    十月二十六日，我突破敌北营要塞南线大军，继续向东山坚固设防山头要塞的敌人总攻开始了。某团陈政委高举着旅党委会送来的“胜利”红旗，向主攻部队指战员号召：“在临汾战壕争夺战中，我们出现了李海水英雄连，成为全纵队一面光辉的旗帜，我们这次配合兄弟部队攻占东山内防线，一定要发扬李海水同志机智顽强战场互助的战斗作风。把胜利的旗帜，插到山头要塞上。”攻击开始前，李海水连的英雄们，都信心百倍的，要在攻打太原战斗中高举起海水连攻无不克的光荣旗帜。
    当时震撼山谷的炮声，揭开了全线进攻的序幕。我隐伏于山梁上的炮兵群，猛烈的轰击大脑山右翼削堡和伏地碉。炮弹着地腾起的硝烟尘土把几个山腰堡垒笼盖住了。冉团长在观察所里发现敌人集团阵地前沿的暗堡大部摧毁了，立即命令七、八连发起冲锋，他简明而有力的说：“要那个连动作迅速勇猛把红旗插在要塞阵地上。”
    冲锋号从前进阵地上响了，八连勇士们迅速夺占了前沿土坎上三个暗堡，沿着西道棱坎向右翼方碉攻击。李海水连突击队的英雄们，乘着敌人炸弹的烟雾，冲上一道斜坡直扑东西梅花大碉集团阵地。人民功臣八班长率领的突击队象旋风一样扑到外壕跟前，刘志山一面喊叫暗堡有敌人，一面就把炸弹投进暗堡里面爆炸了。冯毛孩是战斗互助组长刚十八岁，他伸着手摸不着外壕的边沿。他架着人梯爬上去，冯、刘两人也跨过鹿砦铁丝网，并肩齐进，攻占了敌人东南角上作战工事的缺口。阎匪军野战阵地里，打出几颗燃烧弹，把工事前沿的干草全烧着了，半山腰燃起一片淡绿的火龙。机枪手王韦借着火光，端起枪来掩护突击组前进。
    战斗在山顶主阵地上激烈地进行着。
    冯毛孩赶到土坡前面去观察敌情，给刘志山具体指挥攻击目标。三个匪徒从交通壕掩体里，打出一排炸弹。毛孩拾起来就回敬敌人。最后一颗投在他眼前一直转圈，他一脚踢到避弹坑里。乘势投出一颗炸弹，炸死一个匪徒，其余两个就在他的刺刀面前投降了。可是，这时土坎上纵横交错的野战工事里的敌人，炸弹还不断的向他们打来。刘志山发现敌人露出身子来才能投弹，于是毛孩就与老刘分工，一人投弹时另一人就专门打枪，压制了敌人的火力，巩固了突破口的阵地。
    天黄昏了，后续部队在外壕前沿构筑阵地。敌人还是从两翼到野战阵地上向毛孩他们反击。在危急情况下，六班阎生春朝右翼阵地上过来，他们拣到敌人溃败时遗弃的一箱手榴弹，三个人立即进行战壕互助，阎生春身体结实，炸弹投的远，毛孩给他指示投弹目标，老刘帮助揭盖，毛孩指到哪里，他就打到哪里。他们密切配合，消灭了土坎上野战阵地敌人的抵抗。冯毛孩的战斗小组，象一只铁腕，卡住了敌人的咽喉，掩护九连后续部队插向纵深，把敌集团阵地割碎。接着本组的战友张连荣也来了（这时阎生春返回六班建制），他们又继续向前搜索，从一个俘虏口里，了解敌人一个团的兵力，已经伤亡过半开始溃退了。冯毛孩马上鼓动大家：我们要发扬李海水同志战场互助顽强作战的精神，“不能让敌人退却，要彻底消灭掉”。他立即指定张连荣监视正面敌人，带领刘志山继续向前攻击。他们穿过野战工事，在梅山大碉的几个暗洞附近，便与八班副张友动带的爆破组汇合了。漆黑一团的夜空里爆破组同志，凭借着他们投掷炸弹所发出的火光，侦察好道路。进行了连续爆破，海水连突击队的英雄们，击溃十倍以上敌人，终于把梅花大碉集团阵地全部攻占了。
    海水连第八班突击队的英雄们，首先爬上山头堡垒，立即把“胜利”红旗展开，树在山头堡垒上。他们俯瞰东山脚下太原孤城一片暗淡的灯光，发出了胜利的欢呼，团党委会从电话上接到海水连突击队首先夺取梅花主碉集团阵地的消息：认为海水连英雄们在攻坚战中，执行了徐司令的“勇猛、顽强、大胆、敏捷”的战术指示，发扬了李海水同志机智顽强互助分工优良的战斗作风，决定立集体功。海水连攻占山头堡垒的人民英雄，冯毛孩、张连荣、阎忠佐等被群众推荐经团党委会批准光荣的火线入党！
