　　This story happened recently during the annihilation battle at Jiajiaying, east of Xuanhua.
　　Instructor Xie Cai had just rushed into the village with the Sixth Company when a signaler came up and reported, "Sixth Company Commander is seriously wounded; he's been carried down."
　　Xie Cai wanted to see him and asked the signaler to lead him to the edge of a trench outside the village. The gunfire in the village was intense, and the wounded being carried down lay quietly on the embankment. The medics were busy bandaging their wounds, and not a sigh or shout could be heard.
　　Sixth Company Commander Liang Haichen was wounded by an enemy grenade when he led a platoon to the front of the enemy's position near a burning haystack. He suffered serious injuries to his arms, legs, and neck. Xie Cai saw that his neck was wrapped in a white bandage and his chest was soaked with blood. He was lying on the embankment, on the verge of death, so he restrained his grief and comforted him, "You'll be alright... I'll find you a stretcher and have you carried down."
　　But Liang Haichen grabbed Xie Cai's hand and struggled to speak, "Instructor, come down here for a moment..." His dim eyes were fixed on the other person, as if he had something important to say.
　　Xie Cai leaned down and said, "Tell me what's on your mind, and I will certainly take care of it for you..."
　　Liang Haichen frowned and said with rapid breathing, "Instructor, hurry and tell our political instructor and deputy political instructor not to forget this 'Five Comparisons' campaign, and absolutely not let our company fall behind..."
　　Xie Cai could no longer hold back. A surge of hot tears welled up in his eyes. He straightened up and said, "Okay, I'll go right now! I will not only tell your company what you said, but also the entire army!"

　　伟大的嘱托
    徐原
    这故事发生在最近宣化以东贾家营的歼灭战里。
    教导员谢才跟随六连刚冲进村子，通讯员赶上来报告说：“六连长挂了重花，抬下去了。”
    谢才要去看看他，叫通讯员领着找到村外一个土壕子边沿上。村里的枪声正紧，抬下来的伤员都安静地躺在土坎子上，卫生员正忙着替他们绑扎伤口，听不见一声叹息或叫喊。
    六连长梁海琛是在带一排人冲到敌人阵地前沿燃烧着的谷草垛旁时，叫敌人手榴弹打伤了，胳膊上、脚上、脖子上都受了重伤。谢才见他脖子上绑了白绷带，胸前阴透了血，躺在土坎子上，奄奄一息，就忍住自己的悲痛安慰他说：“你不要紧……我去给你找一付担架，抬你下去。”
    梁海琛却拉了谢才的手，挣扎着用力说：“教导员，你下来一下……”灰暗的眼睛紧盯着对方，似乎有什么要紧心事要说。
    谢才俯下身道：“你有什么挂牵告诉我，一定替你照料……”
    梁海琛绉一绉眉头，呼吸急促地说：“教导员，你快去告诉我们指导员和副指导员，叫他们不要忘了这回的‘五比’运动，万不能叫我们连落后……”
    谢才再也忍不住了，眼眶里忽地涌出一股热泪，他挺起身说：“好，我这就去！我不但要把你的话告诉你们连，还要告诉全军！”
