　　Xinhua News Agency, Huaihai Front, 5th: General Liao Yunzhou, commander of the 110th Division of the 85th Army of the Kuomintang army's Huang Wei Corps, after leading his division to revolt on the battlefield, issued a letter to the officers and soldiers of the Kuomintang army's Huang Wei 12th Corps. The original text is as follows:
    
　　To Chief of Staff Chen, Commander Huang, Deputy Commander Wu, Commander Xiong, Commander Yang, Commander Qin, Commander Huang Zihua, Commander Zhang Guobin, Commander Tan Junming, and all officers and soldiers of the entire corps:

　　In this battle on the south bank of the Hui River, more than 100,000 troops of well-equipped divisions fought bitterly for five days but could not cross the Hui River to join forces in Suxian. On November 24th, 25th, and 26th, the decision wavered, leading to encirclement. Although repeated assaults were launched, not only was there no progress, but the encirclement gradually narrowed. Shuangduiji, Jinzhuang, Yangweizi, and Sanguanmiao, less than ten li east to west and less than five li north to south, only ten or so villages, gathered more than 100,000 soldiers. Vehicles and soldiers were mixed together, ammunition and food were exhausted, suffering from hunger and cold, wailing and crying, a truly unbearable sight. You brothers, being in such a situation, must have felt it. Now we are in a place of certain death, and breaking through is impossible. The reason is that the three armies are unwilling to fight desperately, and morale is low. Most officers and soldiers understand that this kind of war violates the will of the people and are unwilling to shed blood for the Kuomintang reactionaries. Even strict orders have no effect. For example, the night attacks on Dingzhuang and Sanguanzhuang, and the capture of Zhouweizi and Xuzhai, caused heavy losses. Furthermore, with the power of tanks and artillery, multiple attempts to break through to Jiazhuan failed to make any progress. All the facts prove that the general trend is gone and cannot be reversed. For your sake, you should consider the life and death of yourselves and your subordinates, abide by the ancient motto of "a wise man protects himself," and do not make unnecessary sacrifices. Jinan, Jinzhou, Changchun, and Shenyang all have solid fortresses, but they still could not be defended. In the battle of Nianzhuang in eastern Xuzhou, the Qiu and Li Corps were only a short distance away, but Huang Botao's Corps still could not avoid annihilation. Shuangduiji was hastily arrayed, with no defensible terrain. You generals were supposed to reinforce Suxian, but instead were caught in a heavy encirclement. What other troops can relieve your siege? At this moment, the entire Xubeng front is collapsing, and Nanjing and Shanghai are in imminent danger. The Li Yannian and Liu Ruming Corps to the north have retreated south to the south of Bengbu, and the Qiu, Li, and Sun Corps to the south have abandoned Xuzhou and fled west. They can hardly protect themselves, how can they take care of you? You should know that the situation has reached a dead end, and any struggle will inevitably lead to complete sacrifice. The officers and soldiers of this division, aware of this, resolutely launched an uprising on November 29th and joined the People's Liberation Army. We have received enthusiastic care from the military and civilians in the liberated areas, and there is no discrimination whatsoever. The officers and soldiers of this division have stepped into the light, are spiritually free and happy. Thinking back to your situation, what you have suffered, and thinking of the hundreds of thousands of officers and soldiers, all of whom have been comrades-in-arms for many years, I cannot stand idly by in either a public or private capacity. For the sake of preserving a bit of vitality for the country and the nation, I especially address these earnest words to you. The situation is critical, I hope that you will stop resisting as soon as possible, lay down your arms, the policy of the People's Liberation Army has long been effective, your lives will be absolutely guaranteed. Hastily, I cannot express all that I wish to say. Respectfully, Liao Yunzhou, November 30th.

　　廖运洲告黄维兵团官兵：
    放下武器才是生路
    【新华社淮海前线五日电】国民党军黄维兵团之八十五军一百一十师师长廖运洲将军，率该师于战场起义后，发表告国民党军黄维第十二兵团官兵书。原文如下：
    陈参谋长转黄司令官、吴副司令官、熊军长、杨军长、覃军长、黄师长子华、张师长国斌、谭师长俊明诸兄暨全兵团全体官兵均鉴：
    此次浍河南岸战斗，以精锐装备之师十余万之众，五日苦战也不能渡过浍河，会师宿县。十一月二十四日、二十五日、二十六日三天，决策动摇，致陷重围，虽一再冲杀，不但毫无进展，而包围团反逐渐缩小。双堆集、金庄、杨围子、三官庙，东西不满十里，南北不到五里，仅十余个村庄，会集十余万大兵，车兵杂沓，弹尽粮绝，饥寒交迫，悲恸啼号，惨不忍睹。此种情况，诸兄身处其境，当有所感。现在处在必死之地，突围已不可能。其原因乃是三军不愿用命，战意消沉，多数官兵已了解这种战争违反民意，不肯再替国民党反动派拼命流血，虽有严格命令，亦无丝毫效果。如丁庄、三官庄之被夜袭，周围子、许寨之被攻占，其损失何等重大？又如以坦克大炮之威力，屡次企图往贾庄突围，均未获任何进展。一切事实，证明大势已去，无可挽回。为诸公计，应念及自身与部属之死活，遵守明哲保身之古训，勿作无谓牺牲。济南、锦州、长春、沈阳，均有坚固城寨，尚不能保。徐东碾庄之战，邱、李两兵团相距咫尺，黄伯韬兵团仍不免覆亡。双堆集临时布阵，无险可恃。诸公以增援宿县，即隐重围，更有何部队能解诸公之围？刻徐蚌全线溃退，京沪岌岌可危，北援之李延年、刘汝明两兵团，已南撤蚌埠以南，南援之邱、李、孙三兵团，已弃徐州西逃，彼辈自身尚难保，何暇兼顾诸公？应知局势已临绝境，任何挣扎，必致全部牺牲。本师官兵，有鉴及此，乃于十一月二十九日，毅然举行起义，加入人民解放军，当蒙解放区军民热情爱护，并无任何歧视。本师官兵已步入光明，精神自由愉快，回念诸公处境，曾所身受，又念十余万官兵，均属多年袍泽，于公于私，均难坐视。为国家民族多保存一分元气计，特向兄等迫切陈词。势已危急，希望诸公及早停止抵抗，放下武器，人民解放军政策早已见诸实效，诸公生命必获绝对保障，匆匆，不尽所言。廖运洲敬启十一月三十日。
