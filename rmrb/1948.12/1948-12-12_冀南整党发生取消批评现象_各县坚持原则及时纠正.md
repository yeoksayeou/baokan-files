    Cancellation of Criticism Occurs in the Rectification of the Party in Southern Hebei
    Various Counties Adhere to Principles and Correct in a Timely Manner
    [Report from this newspaper] Reporter Lu Hao reports: The preliminary Party rectification work carried out in some areas of southern Hebei has achieved considerable results. The relationship between the Party and the masses and the unity within the Party have been improved. However, in the Party rectification of some villages, a tendency to condone the mistakes of Party members and cancel criticism is growing to varying degrees. This has aroused the vigilance of the leadership and is being checked and corrected. These right-leaning tendencies are mainly manifested in the fear of seriously facing the impurity within the Party, the fear of launching principled criticism against Party members with mistakes, accommodating compromise, abandoning principles, and some even completely denying the necessity of Party rectification. The Wei County Party Committee said in its inspection of the current Party rectification work on October 15: "Today, the most widespread and major deviation existing in Party rectification is the right-leaning deviation of daring not to expose and criticize impurity within the Party, being constrained, and accommodating and condoning Party members..." According to Wei County's research, this deviation is first manifested in the failure to adhere to principles and face the impurity within the Party squarely. For example, some comrades talk about past left-leaning errors with relish, but they speak very abstractly about impurity within the Party, attributing Party members' errors entirely to "for the sake of work" or "insufficient education" in an attempt to make the atmosphere more "harmonious." As a result, Party members cannot correctly recognize their mistakes, but mistakenly believe that the leadership was completely wrong in the past. For example, the Ma Liu Village branch concealed 470 mu of black land in the whole village, but even after it was found out, it was not criticized or dealt with. Because they dare not carry out ideological struggle, evil spirits rise. For example, Zhang Yuhui's wife, a member of the poor peasants' association in Danning Village, liked to express her opinions during the Party rectification. This time, when her daughter got married, the land she had originally been allocated was taken back by the Party cadres. Secondly, in correcting the "kicking away at one go" problem in the previous period, they went to the other extreme, adopting a "kowtow policy" towards the dismissed Party cadres, reinstating them all without distinguishing between right and wrong. For example, in Gu Xian Village, the work team apologized to all Party cadres without exception, fearing that if one of them collapsed, all of them would collapse. Zhang Laochun, the director of the farmers' association, casually cursed in the street. The work team went to him several times, but he sat on a deck chair and ignored them. In some places, when they found incompetent Party cadres, they dared not move them. For example, Wang Xuanzhi, the secretary of the Li Jiatun branch, had many problems and could not lead the Party rectification, but in order to avoid him making trouble, they did not dare to make necessary adjustments, and he was still the chairman during the Party rectification. As a result, some Party members with problems became arrogant again. Some Party members in Gu Xian said: "It's okay for new cadres to make suggestions, but it's not okay for them to do work." They satirized the new cadres: "We are working for your happiness, and you are giving us suggestions." Thirdly, they do not seriously rectify the Party, and even if they do, they are perfunctory, regarding inviting the masses to participate in the Party rectification and listening to the opinions of the masses as dispensable. At the county cadres' meeting at the end of October, the sixth and seventh districts all pointed out: some branches are very good, and there is no need to invite the masses to participate, just criticize them within the Party. The Ninth District Party Committee planned that 22 of the 28 branches in the district could not be reorganized, but did not state the branch situation and detailed basis.
    Similar buds of these right-leaning tendencies exist in other counties. For example, in Ren County, cadres dare not explain the Party rectification policy to the masses. The Da Dai Village branch has ten Party members, but because two Party members disagree with publicizing it, the cadres dare not publicize it. Some villages in Xiazhen and En County dare not carry out Party rectification again, fearing that it will be "left" again; even if they do, they are careless, only examining some insignificant small things. The Ma Tou work team in Qiu County dare not mobilize the masses to make suggestions to the Party; the Gucheng Ying work team takes a uniformly reliant attitude towards the branch members without distinguishing them. After three Party members in Dong Gu Cheng in Guantao Seventh District were "elected" as cadres, the masses had many opinions and asked him to reflect, but a letter from a work team in another village said: "Don't rectify like you did in the past!" The work team did not fully accept the opinions of the masses. As soon as the work team of Da Mazhuang in Guangping arrived in the village, they took the idea of apologizing to the branch, and held several meetings in a row, always asking the Party members to make suggestions to the higher authorities, but not mentioning the Party members' mistakes, creating a situation where the Party members unilaterally shouted grievances and complained to the leaders, without recognizing their own mistakes. For example, Li Tongde said: "The higher authorities talk about taking care of the poor all day long, but we haven't gained much benefit. The Party rectification has become corruption! The higher authorities told us to be corrupt..." Li Futong, who originally had great mistakes, also felt that the Party had wronged him this time, and kept shouting grievances and complaining.
    The leadership at all levels has paid timely attention to these right-leaning buds. The Wei County Party Committee made a review of the current Party rectification work on October 15, clearly pointing out that the right-leaning tendency is the main one in the current Party rectification, and promptly conveyed the results of the inspection to each district, educating everyone to be vigilant. The comrades of the County Party Committee are also preparing to go down, go deep into the villages to discover problems, educate cadres to overcome the growing right-leaning tendency, and correctly implement the Party rectification policy. After discovering this tendency, the Ren County Party Committee promptly paid attention to it, educated cadres and branches with the correct Party rectification policy, on the one hand, educating branch members to recognize and correct their mistakes, and unite the active and better elements; on the other hand, calling on the masses to make suggestions, and initially improve the relationship between the Party and the masses. This timely attention and practical measures by the leadership have enabled some of the growing right-leaning tendencies to be corrected and overcome in a timely manner, so that the Party rectification work can advance in the correct direction.

### 冀南整党发生取消批评现象  各县坚持原则及时纠正

    冀南整党发生取消批评现象
    各县坚持原则及时纠正
    【本报讯】记者陆灏报导：冀南若干地区初步进行的整党工作，已获得相当成绩，在党群关系、党内团结上，都有了改进；但在部分村庄的整党中，正在程度不同的滋长着一种姑息党员错误与取消批评的偏向，已引起领导上的警惕，正注意检查纠正中。这些右的偏向主要表现为不敢严肃的正视党内不纯，不敢向有错误的党员展开原则性的批评，迁就妥协、放弃原则，有的甚至根本否认整党的必要。威县县委在十月十五日检查目前整党工作说：“今天整党中存在的大量的普遍的主要偏向是不敢揭发批评党内不纯、束手束脚、对党员迁就姑息的右倾偏向。……”据威县的研究，这种偏向，首先表现在不敢坚持原则正视党内不纯，如有些同志谈起以往左倾错误时，津津有味；对党内不纯则说得很抽象，将党员错误完全归咎于“为了工作”或“教育不够”，以图把空气弄得更“和缓”些。因此使党员不能正确认识自己的错误，而误认为过去领导上完全错了。如马留村支部隐瞒了全村四百七十亩黑地，虽经查出，也不批评处理。因不敢开展思想斗争，邪气上升，如大宁村贫农团委员张玉惠之妻，整党时好发表个意见，这次闺女出嫁，本来已分得的一份土地，又被党员干部收了回去。其次是在纠正前一时期“一脚踢开”的毛病时，却又走向另一极端，对被撤职的党员干部，一律采取“磕头政策”，不分青红皂白，央告他们一律复职。如固献村所有党员干部，工作组毫无例外地向他们道歉，生怕他们一人躺倒全体躺倒。农会主任张老春，随便骂街，工作组找他几次，他坐在躺椅上似理不理。有的地方发现不称职的党员干部，也不敢动。如李家屯支书王选之，毛病很多，不能领导整党，但为怕他闹情绪，也不敢作必要调整，整党时又仍由他当主席，结果，使某些有毛病的党员又趾高气扬。固献有的党员说：“新干部提意见行，作工作就不行了”。他们讽刺新干部：“我们给你们谋幸福，你们给我们提意见”。再次表现在不去认真整党，即使进行也是敷衍了事，将邀请群众参加整党与倾听群众意见，看成可有可无。十月底全县干部大会时，六、七区都曾提出：有的支部很好，不用请群众参加，只在党内批评一下就算了。九区二十八个支部，区委就计划有二十二个支部可以不作组织调整，但并没有说出支部情况与详细根据。
    以上这些右的偏向，在其他县份也有类似萌芽。如任县干部不敢向群众讲解整党方针，大代村支部有十个党员，因有两个党员不同意公开，干部就不敢公开。夏津、恩县有的村不敢再进行整党，怕再“左”了；即整也是潦草从事，只检讨一些不关重要的小事情。邱县马头工作组，不敢发动群众向党提意见；古城营工作组，对支部党员不加分别研究，采取一律依靠的态度。馆陶七区东固城三个党员被“选”成干部后，群众意见很多，要求他反省，可是外村工作组来信说：“别象过去那样整了！”工作组就未充分接受群众的意见。广平大马庄工作组一到村，即抱定向支部认错思想，一连开了几次会，总是要党员给上级提意见，对党员错误则不提，造成党员片面向领导喊冤诉苦，不认识自己错误。如李同德说：“上级整天说照顾穷人，咱还没沾多大光呢，整党都成了贪污了！都是上级叫咱贪的。……”李复同本来错误很大，这次也觉得党把他屈了，不断喊冤诉苦。
    对这些右倾的萌芽，各地领导上已及时予以注意。威县县委会于十月十五号对目前整党工作做了检讨，明确指出当前整党中右的偏向是主要的，并将检查结果及时传达各区，教育大家提起警惕。县委同志也正准备下去，深入村中发现问题，教育干部克服滋长着的右倾偏向，正确执行整党政策。任县县委发觉这种偏向后，及时提起注意，以正确的整党方针教育干部、支部，一方面教育支部党员认识与改正错误，团结积极与较好分子；一方面号召群众提意见，初步改善党群关系。领导上这种及时的注意与实际措施，使某些滋长着的右偏，得以及时纠正与克服，使整党工作能向正确的方向推进。
