　　[Reported by this newspaper] The North China Trade Corporation, in order to further promote the winter production campaign, specifically instructed each district company and store to seize the winter trade season and carry out business operations. It specifically pointed out that the winter slack season for farmers is a time for the masses to develop various sideline productions. Therefore, the masses will inevitably sell the various finished products they produce in exchange for the materials needed for their production and life. In this way, the sales of goods in the market will greatly increase, the transaction volume will increase, the currency circulation will accelerate, and the commercial profits may decrease accordingly. Because of this, the blindness of market transactions and the speculative nature of some merchants will also occur. Based on this situation, the basic task of our trade business this winter should be to vigorously serve production, support and develop cooperatives, and organize farmers to carry out winter production through cooperatives. We should also strictly correct the behavior of some state-owned stores that violate trade policies. To this end, our district companies and stores must always pay attention to the changes in winter trade, the laws of commercial profits and material circulation, appropriately grasp the differences between regions and commodities, reduce the blindness in the market, and be prepared to fight against speculative merchants at all times. At the same time, it is also necessary to plan to organize and transfer materials to industrial areas, disaster areas, and urban transportation hubs, laying a material foundation for stabilizing prices and supporting production next spring.

　　华北贸总指示发展合作社
  　严厉打击投机商人  扶助农民冬季生产
    【本报讯】华北贸易总公司，为进一步开展冬季大生产运动，特指示各区公司、商店，应抓紧冬季大贸易季节，开展业务经营。具体指出：当冬季农闲时期，是群众开展各种副业生产的时期，因此，群众必然将自己所生产出的各种成品向外出售，交换回自己生产和生活之资料。这样，市场商品销量上会随之大大增加，交易额会加大，货币流通量会加速，商业利润可能随之降低。因之，市场交易的盲目性与某些商人的投机性也会随之发生。根据此种情况，我们今冬贸易业务的基本任务，应大力为生产服务，扶助与发展合作社，通过合作社来组织农民进行冬季生产。并应严格纠正某些公营商店违犯贸易政策的行为。为此，我们各区公司、商店必须经常注意冬季贸易变化，商业利润和物资流转的规律，适当掌握地区与商品间的差额，减少市场上的盲目性，时刻准备向投机商人进行斗争。同时还要有计划地把物资组织调运到工业区、灾区和城市交通要点上去，给明春平稳物价与扶助生产打下物质基础。
