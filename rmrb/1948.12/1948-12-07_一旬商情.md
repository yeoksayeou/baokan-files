　　Ten-Day Market Report
    Commercial Intelligence Section of the North China Trade General Office
    November 15th to 25th

    Over the past ten days, prices for various commodities in the North China region have shown greater fluctuations in the border areas, with more stable prices inland, lower prices in the south and higher prices in the north, rising prices in the east and falling prices in the west. In East China, the Bohai region has been stable, while Jiaodong has shown a rising trend. Jin-Sui has shown a trend of prices falling in the north, remaining stable in the center, and rising in the south. In the above-mentioned areas, grains, cotton, and cloth have fluctuated more, while oil and salt have remained stable. Specific details of various commodities in various regions are reported below:

    Grains: In southwestern Hebei-Shandong-Henan and northeastern Hebei Central, prices have risen due to the impact of high grain prices in the enemy-occupied areas adjacent to the border regions. Prices have also shown an upward trend in Beiyue and Jinzhong, while prices in other regions have remained stable. In Puyang, from the 10th to the 20th, due to the impact of grain shortages and price increases caused by floods in Pan Du in Yubei, millet and miscellaneous grains rose by 16%, and wheat rose by 20%. In Liaocheng in the central region, prices fell, with all grains falling by 2% to 3%. Prices in Jinnan remained stable and fell back slightly. In Hebei Central, from the 10th to the 20th, the northeast was affected by the skyrocketing grain prices in Tianjin in the KMT-controlled area, leading to an outflow of grain from our area and a sharp rise in prices. In Bozhen and Cangxian, rice and wheat rose by 10% to 11%, and miscellaneous grains rose by 20% to 28%. This also affected Laiyuan in the northern part of the Beiyue region, where prices also showed an increase. From the 14th to the 24th, corn rose by 16.5%, and red sorghum rose by 30%. In Hunyuan in the northwest, adjacent to Jin-Sui (where there was a bumper harvest this year), grain poured in and prices remained stable. In Shijiazhuang City, from the 17th to the 28th, due to abundant grain reserves in the city and the arrival of more grain, prices remained stable, with millet at 382 yuan per jin, wheat at 480 yuan, a slight increase of 6%, corn at 295 yuan, and red sorghum at 260 yuan, all stable. Jinzhong is generally stable, but in Yuci, due to the recent reduction in the amount of grain on the market as the masses were busy supporting the front and transporting supplies, prices rose slightly. From the 13th to the 23rd, rice rose by 10%, wheat rose by 4.9%, and miscellaneous grains rose by 11.5% to 19%. In Taihang and Taiyue, prices remained stable in most areas, except for Yicheng, which was affected by grain price fluctuations in Linfen, Jin-Sui. In Bohai, from the 13th to the 21st, rice in Deshi rose by 3.1%, and wheat remained stable; wheat in Linyi fell by 1.4%. Jinan City: Grain prices rose slightly.

In Hebei Central, from the 15th to the 20th, cotton prices rose sharply due to competition. Cotton in Jiuchengzi rose by 38% (from the 10th to the 20th), and fell back slightly after the 25th. However, from the perspective of the entire region, the upward trend in Hebei Central is still prominent. Cotton in Wurenqiao rose by 10%, cloth rose by 10.5%, cotton in Bozhen rose by 9.5%, and cloth rose by 26%. Cotton in Xinji rose by 10%, which also affected Laiyuan in the Beiyue region.

Within the North China region, sea salt in Puyang has been selling well recently. Over 100,000 jin have been sold at fairs in the Kaifeng area south of the Yellow River. From the 14th to the 24th, the price rose from 360 yuan to 380 yuan per jin. Luyi salt in Jinan has been selling well east of the Longhai Line since the liberation of Maojin Ferry, so salt prices in Linfen and Yicheng have both risen (in Jicheng, the price rose from 230 yuan to 300 yuan per jin). In addition, comparing the prices in various parts of North China this ten-day period with those in early August: edible oil has fallen by an average of 25% to 30%, and edible salt has fallen by an average of 15% to 20%.
