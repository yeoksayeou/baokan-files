　　Collection of Soviet Culture
    ▲To eternally commemorate Andrei Zhdanov, the Soviet Council of Ministers has decided that the Marx-Engels-Lenin Institute will be responsible for publishing the complete works and biography of Zhdanov in 1949-50.
    ▲The Central Committee of the Soviet Composers' Union will hold a plenary meeting this month to discuss the work of Soviet composers since the publication of the CPSU (B) Central Committee's decision on the opera "The Great Friendship." The main issues to be discussed at the plenary session will be: further development of national music, the current situation of musical culture in the Soviet republics, and new musical achievements.
    ▲The Soviet Composers' Union held several concerts in September to listen to several new musical works completed by Soviet composers this summer. Soviet musicians were satisfied with the depth and realism in the new works of Soviet composers, as well as the combination of simplicity and musical melody. Vasylenko's Fifth Symphony was highly valued and has been included in the repertoire of many Soviet musical groups.
    ▲Special film studios in Moscow, Leningrad, Kyiv, Sverdlovsk, and other cities have produced about 50 popular science films this year. The film "What Scientists Are Studying" includes films such as "Life in the Future," "Smart Machines," "Radio Echo," "The Life of a Cell," and "Ghost Light." Films made for rural areas include the latest achievements in cultivating crops, raising livestock, and electrical cultivation. Several prominent scientists are helping to make popular science films.
    ▲The Soviet Union recently published a collection of poems entitled "Struggle for Peace, Struggle for Democracy!" which contains poems by 66 Russian, Ukrainian, Belarusian, Latvian, Armenian, Kazakh, and other Soviet poets. The authors of these poems express high praise for the heroic soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Greek People's Democratic Army, the Spanish guerrillas, and the youth of Vietnam, who are fighting for the freedom and independence of their nations. There are also many poems written to American and British soldiers—Soviet people's comrades-in-arms in the anti-Hitler war. Soviet poets warn them that American and British capitalists are preparing a new war against the peaceful people of the Soviet Union. The collection also contains several satirical poems that bitterly satirize the new warmongers.
    ▲Soviet newspapers have now spread to the most remote corners of the Soviet Union—every village in the Pamir Plateau and the far north. During the Soviet era, the number of newspapers published in the Soviet Union has increased more than tenfold. Airplanes, trains, cars, ships, camels, and even dog-drawn sleds, all kinds of transportation, are used to transport various kinds of printed materials to their subscribers. In the Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug, the Hanti people had only seven newspaper subscribers before the revolution, but now the people receive 20,000 copies of newspapers. In Karaganda, no newspapers were seen before the revolution, but now 97,000 copies of newspapers are received.
    ▲Science and technology books account for a quarter of all publications in the Soviet Union. In Moscow alone, there are 31 publishing houses that publish such books. Two thousand five hundred new books on science and technology have been put on sale, which will enable workers, technicians, and engineers to improve their professional knowledge.
    ▲Literary creation in the Uzbek Republic was previously mainly based on historical themes, but since the promulgation of the CPSU Central Committee's decision on literature two years ago, excellent works in various forms covering a wide variety of themes have emerged. Widely circulated are: the poet Mumin's poem "Yusta Giyas" praising the excellent cotton planting expert Giyas, and the poem "Green Village" describing the collective farmers' struggle to conquer the desert.
    ▲The publishing house of the Soviet Academy of Sciences has published a sample of Volume 1 of the Large Chinese-Russian Dictionary. These samples are being sent to Sinologists throughout the Soviet Union for review. The dictionary is rich in content and includes many new materials, especially modern academic works and political terms. Volume 1 alone contains as many as 40,000 entries. The Soviet Institute of Oriental Studies has now begun compiling the subsequent volumes. (Xinhua News Agency)
