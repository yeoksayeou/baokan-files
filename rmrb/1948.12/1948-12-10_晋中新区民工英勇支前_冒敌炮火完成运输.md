Civil Laborers in Jinzhong New District Bravely Support the Front
　　Completing Transportation Under Enemy Fire
　　[Jinzhong Telegraph] Civil laborers in the Jinzhong New District, liberated only four months ago, have demonstrated immense effort and bravery in supporting the People's Liberation Army fighting on the Taiyuan front. When mobilized to participate, Wang Mangui from Pingding immediately signed up upon hearing the call to support the front. Because he didn't have shoes, his wife rushed to make them overnight, but only finished one. As the laborers were about to depart, he wore one new shoe and one old shoe. County comrades told him to go back and change into another pair, but he said, "The mission is so urgent, if I go back and come again, I won't catch up. Don't laugh, I certainly won't fall behind." He volunteered for every task. Once, he was tasked with delivering a message that should have taken three days, but he completed it and returned in two. The squad leader knew he had been on many trips and told him to rest for a day, but he said, "Others may be tired, but I'm not." The fifth squad of stretchers from Wutai, the fourth company of civil laborers from Xiaoyi, and other units had no desertions in more than a month, and they worked actively, exceeding their tasks. Zheng Ergāo, from the fifth company of civil laborers from Qi County, carried a box of shells. Because it was dark and the road was difficult, he lost a shoe. He walked barefoot. The group leader picked it up and gave it to him, saying, "Why did you throw away your shoe?" He said, "Losing a shoe doesn't matter, but if I fall behind or take the wrong path, and the troops don't get the shells, wouldn't that mess things up?" Sun Jiao'er, from the third company of civil laborers from Shouyang, was delivering ammunition to the front lines when they encountered an enemy counterattack. He encouraged everyone, saying, "This is the perfect time to get the ammunition up there so the People's Liberation Army can wipe out the enemy." He took the lead in charging through enemy fire, delivering forty-one boxes of ammunition to our soldiers who were urgently awaiting supplies, ensuring the victory of this battle. The civil laborers of Qi County cared for the wounded as warmly and considerately as if they were their own relatives. Niu Benfa helped the wounded with their bowel movements without minding the dirt. Dong Sanlan took off his coat to give to a wounded soldier, saying, "It doesn't matter if we're a little cold, but we can't let the wound get frostbite." Li Shulin and Qin Shuzhi, civil laborers from Xiaoyi, rolled to the front lines to rescue the wounded. Yang You and his son from Mengjiajing Houaogou in Yuci participated in the war effort and received a commendation from the county.

　　晋中新区民工英勇支前
  　冒敌炮火完成运输
    【晋中电】解放仅四个月的晋中新区民工，在支援太原前线人民解放军作战中，表现了极大的努力和勇敢。在动员参战时，平定王满贵听到动员支前，马上报了名。因他没有鞋，老婆给他连夜赶做，只做好一只，民工就要出发了，他便穿了一只新的一只旧的；县里同志让他回去另换一双，他说：“任务这样紧，回去再来就赶不上了，你们别笑，我总不会掉队的。”有任务他都是自动去做；一次送信，本来须三天，但他两天就完成回来了。班长知道他出差多，让他休息一天，他说：“别人疲乏我可不累”。五台担架第三连，孝义民工第四连等单位，一个多月中无一逃亡，而且工作积极，超过任务。祁县民工五连郑二高，背了一箱炮弹，因天黑路不好走，掉了一只鞋，他便光着脚走；组长拾起来送给他说：“你为什么鞋也不要了？”他说：“丢了鞋不要紧，掉了队走错了路，部队等不到炮弹，不是误了大事吗？”寿阳民工三连孙角儿，往阵地上送弹药，正遇敌人反扑，他便鼓励大家说：“这正是时候，将弹药送上去，好叫解放军把敌人消灭掉。”并带头冲过敌之炮火，将四十一箱弹药送到急待接济的我军战士手里，保证了这次战斗的胜利。祁县民工爱护伤员，象对自己亲人一样的体贴温暖。牛本法扶着伤员大便也不嫌脏；董三兰脱下大衣来给伤员穿，他说：“我们冷一点没关系，可不能叫伤口受了冻”。孝义民工李树林、秦树枝滚着到火线上去抢救伤员。榆次孟家井后凹沟杨友父子参战获得该县通报嘉奖。
