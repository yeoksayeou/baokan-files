　　Xinxiang Coal Mine's Detailed Assessment of Work and Wage Evaluation is More Reasonable than Before
    Workers' Production Efficiency Greatly Improved
    [Our Newspaper] In the past, the wages of mechanical workers at the Xinxiang Coal Mine in Anyang suffered from the mistaken views of the leadership, who valued physical labor and looked down on technical labor. Therefore, there was no strict grade division, showing serious egalitarianism: skilled workers' wages were not high, and those without skills, as long as their work attitude was good, received higher wages. Skilled workers were therefore dissatisfied, and the coal mine leadership called them "backward," which further fueled sectarian opposition between new and old workers, and between unskilled and skilled workers. In order to solve this problem, the mine spent nearly a month in November conducting work assessment and evaluation among mechanical workers (including machinists, fitters, pattern makers, foundry workers, drivers, firemen, pump operators, ironworkers, carpenters, etc.). At the beginning, workers were mobilized to compare skills and efficiency in the work assessment. It was explained that the work assessment was not just a comparison of one task, but assessed whatever work was being done; work assessment books were also created, and the daily work results, quality, efficiency, achievements, and mistakes were recorded separately in the work assessment books. At the same time, the specific standards and wages for each category, grade, and level of worker were announced and posted in each work area. However, in actual practice, only two cadres were assigned to do this, and they could only record the work results each day. When they had time, they would check the work situation in each work area, but the efficiency and skills of drivers and pump operators, and the technical proficiency and quality of finished products of repair workers, did not attract enough attention among the workers. After the mine leadership discovered these situations, they organized a major inspection in the middle of the month, and made a summary report of the ten-day work assessment to the workers, announcing the work assessment results and shortcomings of each worker, and emphasized that this work assessment would determine the wages for the next six months, and that the new standards would be implemented starting in November. This inspection advanced the work assessment a step further. Wang Fuzi used to be careless when operating the pump, and was still irresponsible when transferred to stoking the fire. After his work assessment results were announced and he was criticized, he often helped the repairmen with their work in addition to completing his own work. Cheng Sizi admitted his mistake of sleeping while operating the pump and promised not to do it again in the future. Drivers increased their lifting frequency from 20 times per hour to 22 times per hour, and were more thorough in inspecting high vehicles, reporting any problems for repair at any time. Those stoking the fire paid attention to picking up the furnace fire. Driver Cai Gengsheng was demoted to grade three, level three because he was too careless when driving, causing an accident with the high vehicle, injuring two workers. After strict work assessment, the grades of various workers were correctly evaluated, and the amount of wages was determined. In the evaluation, the actual records of a month's work assessment were used, emphasizing technology and efficiency, thus breaking away from the circle of sectarianism and embarking on the right direction. The morale of technical workers was improved, and they all voluntarily asked to take on more responsibilities. Repair technician Gao Zhankui also gave the factory many constructive suggestions. Although there was still some mutual promotion among some workers during the wage evaluation process, the actual materials of the work assessment and clear grade standards kept the deviation small. The final result of the wage evaluation was: the highest was 105 ＠ (@ is a unit for calculating wages. One @ is equal to the total value of two jin of rice, one jin of wheat, one and a half jin of coal dust, five qian of oil, five qian of salt, and one square chi of cloth), and the lowest was 30 ＠.

　　辛庄煤矿细密考工工资评定较前合理
    工人生产效率大为提高
    【本报讯】安阳辛庄煤矿机务工人的工资，过去因为领导上存在着重视体力劳动，轻视技术劳动的错误观点，所以没有严格的等级划分，表现了严重的平均主义：有技术的工人工资不高，没技术的只要劳动态度好，工资就高一些，技术工人因此不满，而煤矿领导上则说他们“落后”，这样更助长了新老工人、无技术与有技术工人的宗派对立。为解决这一问题，十一月份用了将近一个月的时间，在机务工人（包括机工、钳工、模样、翻砂、开车、烧火、开泵、铁工、木工等）中进行考工、评工。开始时曾在工人中进行动员，号召工人在考工中比技术、比效率，说明考工不只是在一件活上来比较，而是干什么就考什么；还制定了考工簿，把每天工作的结果、质量好坏、效率高低、成绩和错误都分别记入考工簿，同时宣布了各类别、各等、各级工人的各项具体标准与工资，分别张贴在各工作间。但在实际进行中，只分配了两个干部去作，每天只能登记一下工作结果，有了时间到各工作间检查一下工作情况，对开车开泵的效率与技术，修理工的技术熟练程度、成品质量好坏等，都没有在工人中引起足够的注意。该矿领导上发现了这些情况后，月中组织了一次大检查，将十天的考工结果在工人中作了总结性的报告，宣布了每个工人的考工成绩与缺点，并强调声明这次考工要决定今后六个月的工资，从十一月份就要按新标准实行。经过这次检查，把考工推进了一步。王福子过去开泵不用心，调去烧火还是不负责，从宣布他的考工结果、受到批评后，除完成本身工作外，还经常帮助修理匠作活。程四子开泵时睡觉，也承认了错误，保证以后不再犯。开车工人由每小时提升二十次提高到二十二次，对高车检查也较前周到，发生毛病能随时报告修理，烧火的都注意了捡炉火。开车工人蔡更生因开车太不注意，使高车出险，两个工人被跌伤，降为三等三级。经过严格考工，又正确地评定了各种工人的等级，确定了工资数目。在评定中依据一个月考工的实际记录，强调了技术与效率，这样就跳出了宗派的圈子，走上了正确的方向。技术工人情绪提高，都自动要求多负责任。修理技工高占魁并给工厂提了许多建设性的意见。在评定工资过程中虽然仍有某些工人互相抬举的现象，但有考工的实际材料与明确的等级标准，所以偏差不大。工资最后评定的结果是：最高的一零五＠（＠是一种计算工资的单位。一个＠等于二斤米、一斤麦、一斤半煤末、五钱油、五钱盐、一方尺布的总和。），最低的三十＠。
