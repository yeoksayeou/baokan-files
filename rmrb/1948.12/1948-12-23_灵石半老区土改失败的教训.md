The Taiyue First Prefectural Committee Comrade Liang Jiangong inspected the land reform work in the semi-old areas of Lingshi County in the middle of last month. He believes that the area has not been able to open up the situation because the cadres' work is not in-depth, they do not understand the local class relations, and the work methods are not correct. Landlords and rich peasants are still secretly manipulating the regime and ruling the masses. The landlord of Suxi Village superficially distributed land to buy off the peasants, isolate them from us, and collectively conceal land throughout the village. They pleased wealthy middle peasants and isolated poor peasants. They controlled important cadres such as the village head, neighborhood head, finance, and grain, and used hooligan organizations as fake farmers' associations in an attempt to drive back the district cadres and provoke struggles between villages. They increased the yield of land for peasants who had turned over and reduced the yield of land for landlords and rich peasants, increasing the burden on the households that had turned over and causing them to resent us. The villagers said, "The work in this village has only been done recently, and the landlords had prepared in advance!" But the district committee was completely unaware of how the landlords had prepared. Their investigation and research were purely a formality: Nanbu Village had more than five types of investigation forms, and dozens of sheets of Maobian paper were written, but no problems could be seen. They fell into the quagmire of事務主义. For example, mediating the relationship between husband and wife, and the disputes between Zhang San and Li Si. The county committee only listened to reports but lacked a practical understanding of a village, so it could not solve the problem. The work plan formulated by the county committee was also empty and impractical. For example, the steps proposed by the county secretary on mobilizing the masses were: The first step was to put forward a concrete plan for the village within ten days, but it was not stated on what basis to formulate it and what the purpose was. Therefore, the district cadres were distressed that they could not formulate a plan in ten days. The second was to find poor and hired peasants. But some comrades did not know what to do after finding the poor and hired peasants, and as a result, the poor and hired peasants were isolated.

For this reason, the Taiyue Xinhua Daily published a short article calling on all regions to accept the lessons of Lingshi. First, there was no ideological preparation for the conspiracy activities of the landlords. Although the village had also undergone land distribution, the feudal forces had not been defeated. The feudal forces still controlled the village head and neighborhood head and confronted the peasants. This situation may not be unique to Lingshi. Similar situations may exist in all areas where the masses were not fully mobilized and "peaceful land distribution" was carried out in the past. Therefore, in the work of ending land reform, we must proceed from the specific conditions of different regions and villages, check the situation of the elimination of feudalism, determine the focus, principles, and steps of the work, and properly settle the landlords and rich peasants who have been swept out of the house and cannot live, so that they can survive. For places where the masses were not fully and thoroughly mobilized in the past, it is necessary to mobilize the masses to thoroughly eliminate feudalism; for places where only individual landlords and rich peasants have not been thoroughly struggled, their surplus land must be taken out during the end of land reform. For landlords who have escaped the net, their land and property should be confiscated according to law, and then land should be distributed to them. In class determination, we must conduct it seriously based on the central government's standards for class determination, after investigation and mass discussion, and oppose any left or right deviations. The assessment of the situation of feudal elimination must be based on the standards of class determination for investigation and should not blindly believe that there are no problems; nor should it be swayed by one-sided and exaggerated facts. Second, the method of understanding the situation is not to go deep into the masses, to specifically understand the situation from the masses' level of awareness, the relationship between the masses and the landlords and rich peasants, and the actual life and activities of the landlords and rich peasants, but to regard the investigation of the number of people, land, output, houses, etc. as the only situation. Therefore, when dealing with problems, we do not determine our policies based on the specific situation of each household: such as whether to resettle, whether to take out surplus land, whether to compensate, etc.; but simply determine our policies and plans according to numbers. Therefore, the truth of many facts is concealed, the problems cannot be solved reasonably and justly, and even some that should not be moved are moved. Therefore, we must start with the investigation of the specific situation of each household of the landlords and rich peasants and the peasants. Numbers are needed, but we cannot rely entirely on numbers. Third, when deciding on a plan, the area did not conduct a detailed investigation and research on class relations, did not mobilize the masses to clarify the main problems one by one, and made a plan subjectively, which was destined to fail. Many comrades regard formulating plans and schemes as a formality. They are satisfied if they are formulated, regardless of whether they are in line with the actual situation; they are very distressed if they cannot be formulated. In the future, when formulating plans and schemes, they must be discussed and decided by the masses with organization and leadership in advance before they can become a plan for the masses in a village to act on their own. It is necessary to stipulate a time, so that we can organize forces, grasp the time, and avoid procrastination; but because the working conditions of each village are different, the time used will not be the same, so the time should be extended or shortened according to the local working conditions and the development of the situation, and should not be mechanical.

　　灵石半老区土改失败的教训
    太岳一地委梁建功同志于上月中旬检查了灵石县半老区土改工作后，认为该地由于干部工作不深入，不了解当地阶级关系，工作方法不对头，所以一直没有打开局面。地主富农仍在暗中操纵着政权，统治着群众。苏溪村地主以表面上分散土地来收买农民，使农民和我们隔离，活动全村集体瞒地。讨好富裕中农，孤立贫农。掌握了村长、闾长、财粮等重要干部，利用流氓组织假农会，企图将区干部打回去，并挑起村与村之间的斗争。对翻身农民的土地提高产量，对地富的土地降低产量，使翻身户加重负担，怨恨我们。村民说：“这村工作最近才做，地主预先准备好了！”但到底地主如何准备的，区委完全不清楚，他们的调查研究完全是个形式：南堡村调查表有五种以上，写麻纸有数十张，但看不出问题。他们陷入事务主义的泥坑。如：调解夫妇关系，张三、李四个人的纠纷问题。县委光听汇报，但缺乏对一个村的实际了解，所以也不能解决问题。县委订的工作计划，也是空洞不切实际的，如县书关于发动群众所提的步骤是：第一步是在十天内提出本村具体方案，但未提出根据什么来订，目的是什么。所以区干部十天订不出方案就苦恼。第二是找贫雇。但有些同志找到贫雇以后不知道怎样干，结果贫雇陷于孤立。
    为此，太岳新华日报特发表短论，号召各地接受灵石的教训。第一，对地主阴谋活动没有思想准备。该村虽然也经过了分田，但封建势力并没有打垮，封建势力仍然掌握着村长、闾长，与农民对抗。这种情况可能不只灵石一处，凡是过去没有充分发动群众、“和平分田”的地区，可能都有类似的情况存在。所以在土改结束工作中，必须从各种不同地区、不同村庄的具体情况出发，检查封建消灭的情形，确定工作的重点、方针、步骤，对扫地出门的无法生活的地富，必须予以安置，使他们能生活下去；而对于过去群众发动不充分、不彻底的地方，必须发动群众彻底消灭封建；对只有个别地富尚斗得不彻底的地方，则必须在土改结束中，使其拿出其多余土地。对漏网地主，则应依法没收其土地财产，然后分给他土地。在划阶级上，则必须根据中央划阶级的标准，经过调查和群众讨论，认真进行，反对任何或左或右的偏向。对封建消灭情形的估计，必须根据划阶级的标准进行调查，不应麻木地认为毫无问题；亦不应为片面夸大的事实所左右。第二、在了解情况的方法上不是深入到群众中去，从群众的觉悟程度上、群众与地富的关系上，地富的实际生活及其活动上去具体的了解情况，而是把人口、土地、产量、房屋等数目字的调查作为唯一的情况。因此在处理问题时，也不根据每户的具体情形，确定我们的政策：如应安置、应拿出多余土地，应补偿等；而是单纯按照数目字来确定我们的政策和计划。因此有很多事实的真象被隐蔽，不能使问题解决得入情入理，甚至有些不应动的反而动了。所以必须从地富和农民方面每人每户的具体情况调查入手。数目字是需要的，但不能完全凭数目字。第三、该地在决定计划时，没有根据阶级关系的详细调查研究，没有发动起群众，把主要问题一一弄清，就主观地做出了计划，这就注定要失败的。有许多同志把订计划、订方案看成一个形式。订出来了，就不管是否合乎实际情况，表示满足；订不出来，就非常苦恼。以后订计划方案时，事先必须有组织有领导的经过群众的讨论、决定，才可以成为一个村群众自己行动的计划。规定时间是需要的，这样就可以组织力量、掌握时间，避免拖拖拉拉；但因各村工作的条件不一致，所用时间也不会一样，所以时间应根据当地工作条件及情况的发展而有所伸缩，不应机械。
