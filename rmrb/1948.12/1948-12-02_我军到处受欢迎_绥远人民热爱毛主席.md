Xinhua News Agency, Suiyuan-Mongolia Front, 30th: Our army was warmly welcomed everywhere.

During our army's westward advance, a certain day was spent lodged in a small mountain village. Our army had stayed in this village once before, during the spring expedition to Suiyuan earlier this year. This time, passing through here again, everyone felt a warm sensation in their hearts. As soon as it was announced, "Each to their original houses," everyone chuckled with joy: "Good, good, no objections, let's go find our landlords!" We also found the home of the old villager where we had stayed last time, calling out from afar: "Is the old landlord home? We're back again!" After we entered the house, the old man, over sixty years old, scrutinized us under the lamplight for a long time before recognizing us: "So, you've come back again!" He was extremely happy, quickly asking his old wife to boil water, while sitting on the kang and chatting with us about everyday life. He said that after our army left last time, his home was devastated by Fu bandits. He pointed to the front door and said, "The door was torn down and burned, so it couldn't even keep a chicken in." He asked with concern, "How is the situation inside the Pass (referring to areas inside the Great Wall)?" I told him that the peasants had all been allocated land, were working hard to produce, and were living well. He touched my thick and sturdy cotton-padded trousers and sighed, "Alas! This old man will never get to see Chairman Mao in his lifetime! Chairman Mao governs the world so well!" I told him that we were under Chairman Mao's orders to eliminate the Fu bandits and liberate the people of Suiyuan, and I handed him the only photograph of Chairman Mao that I had. He suddenly became as happy as a child, looking at it again and again, never tiring of it, and then holding it with both hands to take it to the inner room for the whole family to see. The old woman walked over with a smile and said, "This is Chairman Mao?!" The daughter-in-law said, "He looks like one of us!" The old man moved closer to the lamplight and told his six or seven-year-old grandson: "Child, this is our Chairman Mao! We're going to have a good life soon!" That night, the whole family was filled with laughter.

　　我军到处受欢迎
  　绥远人民热爱毛主席
    【新华社绥蒙前线三十日电】我军在西进的途中，某日住宿在一个小山村。这个村子，我军今年春季远征绥远时曾驻宿过一次，这一次经过这里，谁的心里都感到热辣辣的。当一宣布“各驻原房”，大家就哗哗地嘻笑起来：“好，好，没意见，找咱们房东去！”我们也找到前次住过的那家老乡家里，老远就喊：“老房东在家吧？我们又来啦！”在我们进屋以后，在灯光下，这个六十多岁的老人端详我们半天才认清了：“原来你们又回来啦！”他高兴得不得了，连忙叫他的老妻烧开水，一面坐在炕头上和我们说起家常来。他说我军那次走了以后，他家被傅匪＠踏得不成样子。他指着大门说：“大门也给拆下烧了，连一只鸡也关不住。”他关心地问：“口里（指长城内）治理得怎样了？”我告诉他，农民都分得了土地，加劲生产，生活很好。他摸一摸我腿上很厚很结实的棉裤，叹了一口气说：“唉！我老汉这一辈子也见不上毛主席了！毛主席治理的天下多好啦！”我告诉他，我们就是奉毛主席的命令来消灭傅匪，解放绥远人民的，并把我仅有的一张毛主席的照片递给他看。他突然象小孩子一样地高兴起来，看了又看，老看不够，又双手捧着到里间屋里叫全家大小都看。老太太笑着走上来说：“这就是毛主席呀！？”儿媳妇说：“一看就是自己人！”老汉凑近灯火，告诉他六七岁的孙儿：“娃娃，这就是咱们的毛主席！咱们快过好日子了！”这一夜，全家人都充满了欢笑。
