Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, December 24th: TASS reports: The currency reform and the abolition of the rationing system implemented in the Soviet Union last year have played a significant role in restoring and developing production and improving the people's living standards. In the first nine months of this year, industrial production has exceeded the pre-war level of 1940 by 17 percent. In agriculture, total output has returned to pre-war levels, and output per hectare has exceeded pre-war levels. As retail prices in state-owned stores gradually decrease, and prices in cooperatives and collective farm markets also decrease accordingly, the purchasing power of the ruble has doubled. The real wages of workers and staff have more than doubled compared to last year. Farmers' incomes have also increased similarly.

The Soviet Minister of Trade, Savronov, wrote in Pravda that as a result of the price reductions on December 16th last year, the Soviet working people have benefited by 57 billion rubles this year. Discussing the prosperity of Soviet trade, Savronov pointed out that in addition to state-owned and cooperative trade, collective farm trade has also expanded further. In the first quarter of 1948, the sales volume of agricultural products in collective farm markets exceeded the pre-war level by 22 percent. In the first quarter of 1948, market prices in collective farms were more than 65 percent lower than in the same quarter last year. In the second and third quarters, market prices further decreased.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, December 24th: TASS reports: Soviet newspapers are celebrating the first anniversary of the currency reform and the abolition of the rationing system for food and industrial products. Pravda published an editorial entitled "The Powerful Strength of the Soviet Economy," stating that the currency reform and the abolition of the rationing system were implemented only two years after the end of a war that caused unprecedented losses to the Soviet Union, and only one year after the occurrence of the most terrible drought in fifty years. This fact demonstrates to the world the invincible vitality of the Soviet system and its enormous superiority over capitalism. The growth of unemployment, the long-term partial use of productive forces—the harbinger of a new economic crisis—this is the current economic characteristic of capitalist countries. For example, the US economy has not even reached 80 percent of the 1942 level. And those capitalist countries that increasingly and completely rely on American capital are suffering even more from decline, stagnation, and instability. In all capitalist countries, inflation is rising incessantly, the gap between wages and prices is widening, the purchasing power of the working people is continuously decreasing, and the poverty of the masses is increasing day by day. Pravda concluded: Only the socialist economic system can guarantee the unlimited development of social productive forces and the continuous rise of people's welfare and culture.

　　苏联币制改革一周年
  　卢布购买力增加两倍
    生产发展人民生活大大提高
    【新华社陕北二十四日电】塔斯社讯：苏联去年实行的货币改革和废除配给制，已对恢复和发展生产及提高人民生活水平起了巨大作用。今年头九个月，工业生产已超过战前一九四○年水平的百分之十七。农业方面，总产量已恢复到战前水平，每公顷的产量则已超过战前水平。由于国营商店零售物价步步降低，合作社和集体农场市场的价格也随之降低，使卢布购买力增加了两倍。职工们的实际工资比去年已增加了两倍多。农民的收入也同样地增加了。
    苏联贸易部长萨伏隆洛夫在真理报上著文称：由于去年十二月十六日降低物价的结果，苏联劳动人民今年已经得到五百七十亿卢布的利益。论及苏联贸易的繁盛时，萨伏隆洛夫指出：除了国营及合作社贸易以外，集体农场的贸易也更为扩大了。一九四八年第一季，集体农场市场上的农产品出售量，已超过战前水平百分之二十二。一九四八年头一季中，集体农场的市场价格，比去年同季减低了百分之六十五以上。在第二、三季中，市场价格又进一步减低。
    【新华社陕北二十四日电】塔斯社讯：苏联各报庆祝货币改革及废除粮食与工业品配给制一周年纪念。真理报以“苏维埃经济的强大力量”为题发表社论称：货币改革及配给制的废除，是在使苏联蒙受空前损失的战争仅仅结束两年之后，在五十年来最可怕的一次旱灾发生仅仅一年之后实行的。这一事实向全世界显示出苏维埃制度的不可征服的活力，及其对资本主义的巨大优越性。失业的增长、生产力的长期局部的使用——新的经济危机的先声——这就是目前资本主义各国经济的特色。譬如，美国经济甚至还未达到一九四二年水平的百分之八十。而那些越来越大地完全仰赖美国资本的资本主义国家，其衰颓、停滞与动荡不定则更加厉害。在一切资本主义国家中，通货膨胀增涨不已，工资与物价间的裂痕日益加深，劳动人民的购买力不断降低，人民大众的贫困日益增长。真理报结语称：只有社会主义的经济制度，才能保证社会生产力的无限发展及人民福利与文化的不断上升。
