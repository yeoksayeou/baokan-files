　　How Should the Burden of Wasteland Be Handled?
    Question: Kongjiazhuang, in the Seventh District of Pingshan, is a village of more than forty households. The village has a large land area, averaging 5.7 mu per person. The land quality in the village is very poor. During the review last year, more than 40 mu were wasteland. During the land distribution this spring, no farmer wanted it, so it was not distributed. During the sowing after the rain, the government, in order not to leave the land barren, proposed that whoever sows would reap the harvest and not bear the burden. Only in this way could farmers be reluctantly found to cultivate it. How should the burden of these lands be determined next year?
    　　　　　　　　　(Liang Maolin, Seventh District of Pingshan)
    Answer: The wasteland in Kongjiazhuang should be distributed to farmers with less land earlier this winter. If the farmers are unwilling to take it because of the poor soil quality, it can be explained that the burden is converted into standard mu based on yield. If the soil quality is poor, the yield will be low, the converted standard mu will be less, and the burden will be lighter. If, because the village has a large land area and the farmers have a lot of land, no one is willing to take it, then this part of the land can be transferred to neighboring villages with less land. Whoever accepts this part of the land should bear the burden. The difficulty of land distribution should not be used as an excuse to leave this part of the land barren and free of burden.

　　荒地负担应如何处理？
    问：平山七区孔家庄，是个四十余户的村庄，该村土地面积很大，每人平均五亩七分，该村的土地质量很坏，在去年复查时，荒无了四十多亩，在今春分配土地时，农民们谁也不要，故未分出去。在雨后播种时，政府为了不荒土地，提出谁种谁收不出负担，这样才勉强的找到种户，这些土地在明年应如何确定负担？
    　　　　　　　　　（平山七区  梁茂林）
    答：孔家庄的荒地，应当在今年冬季早些分给土地较少的农民，如果因为地质坏农民都不愿意要，可说明负担是按产量折成标准亩，地质坏产量就低，折的标准亩就少，负担也就轻了。如若因为该村土地面积很大，农民的土地都不少，谁也不愿意要，那就可以把这部分土地调剂到土地较少的邻村，谁接受这部分土地，谁就应当出负担，不应借着土地分配不出的困难把这部分土地荒着不出负担。
