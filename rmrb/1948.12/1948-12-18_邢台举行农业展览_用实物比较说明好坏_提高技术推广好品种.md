　　Xingtai Holds Agricultural Exhibition
  　Using Physical Comparisons to Illustrate Good and Bad
  　Improving Technology Promotion of Good Varieties
    [Taihang News] In order to improve agricultural technology and promote superior varieties, the Xingtai Agricultural Exhibition Hall specially held an agricultural product exhibition. The exhibition hall started on November 17th and lasted for seven days. Visitors included more than 50,000 people from 15 counties including Jinnan, Jizhong, and Taihang. The main exhibits were insect pests, fertilizers, cotton planting, and afforestation. The exhibition method was to explain the objects and make comparisons. For example, when the narrator introduced insect pests in the insect pest room, everyone was very willing to listen and asked to introduce pest control methods. Hu Rensheng from Shilipu, Shahe, said: "I planted two mu of cotton, which was damaged by oil drought, and only harvested more than 60 jin of seed cotton, which is half less." Hou Youren from Beiliuzhuang, District 5, said: "I planted four mu of wheat, which was eaten by mole crickets. I replanted it once, and it was eaten again." Zhou Hancheng from District 3, Xingtai, said: "I fight with insects every year. Please tell me more about pest control methods, and I will go back and tell people how to control pests." The fertilizer room hung a "Comparison Chart of Various Agricultural Products with and without Fertilization." After seeing it, everyone knew the benefits of fertilization even more. Hu Rensheng from Shahe said: "I applied a lot of fertilizer this year, and one mu of land yielded three bags of grain; my neighbor's land is as good as mine, but he didn't apply fertilizer, and only yielded one bag per mu." After publicizing that "Si Zi Cotton" has long fibers, matures early, produces a lot of lint, and does not require much pruning, everyone believed that this variety was good. After seeing the "Comparison of Cotton Pruning and No Pruning" chart, they all believed that cotton would grow badly if it was not managed. Someone pointed to a cotton plant that had not been pruned and said: "This cotton plant is growing crazy." After seeing the achievement charts of "Planting Trees and Making Forests," everyone nodded in praise.

　　邢台举行农业展览
  　用实物比较说明好坏
  　提高技术推广好品种
    【太行讯】为提高农业技术，推广优良品种，邢台农业展览馆特举行农业品展览会。该馆从十一月十七日起，历时七天。参观者有冀南、冀中、太行等十五县五万余人。主要之展览品为虫害、肥料、植棉、造林等。其展览方式是指物讲解、进行比较，如虫害室当说明员给大家介绍虫害时，大家都非常愿听，并要求介绍治虫办法。沙河十里铺胡仁生说：“我种二亩棉，被了油旱害，才收了六十多斤籽棉，少收一半。”五区北柳庄侯有仁说：“我种四亩麦，被蝼蛄咬光了，补种了一次，又咬光了。”邢台三区周汉成说：“我年年和虫子作对头，请多讲些治虫办法，回去和人们说说好治虫。”肥料室内挂着“上粪与没上粪的各种农业品比较图”，大家看到后更知道了上粪的好处。沙河胡仁生说：“我今年上粪多，一亩地收了三口袋粮食；我邻居和我的地一样好，但没上粪，每亩才收了一口袋。”当宣传了“斯字棉”毛毛长、熟的早、出穰多、打杈不费工后，大家都认为这号品种好。看了“棉花打杈与不打杈的比较”图后，都认为棉花不管理就会长坏。有人指着一棵没打杈的棉花说：“这棵棉花长疯了”。大家看了“植树造林”的成绩挂图后，人人点头称赞。
