　　Ha-Shen Railway Workers Song Ligang and Others Bravely Rush to Transport Seized Materials
    Shenyang Military Control Commission Issues a Circular of Commendation
    [Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 18th] The Shenyang Military Control Commission recently issued a circular, commending sixteen railway employees, including Song Ligang, for bravely rushing to transport seized materials at the South Station on the night of the 3rd of last month (the second day of Shenyang's liberation). At that time, there were more than 1,100 railcars scattered on more than 130 lines at the station, of which about 400 were fully loaded with important materials. In order to avoid destruction by the enemy, the Military Control Commission decided to quickly disperse these materials to safe areas. This urgent and arduous task was successfully completed by sixteen railway workers from Harbin and workers from the original station working together all night. That night, there was no electricity at the station, and it was pitch black everywhere. The ground was covered with fallen telephone poles and scattered wires, as well as unremoved landmines, artillery shells with primers attached, and hand grenades with the lids removed. The workers groped around in the dark for a long time before finding two locomotives, but they lacked coal and water and could not be started. In addition, the lines were unfamiliar, all electrical signals were out of order, and there were power-operated switches everywhere, so even if the locomotives were started, it would be difficult to leave the station. But these difficulties could not shake the workers' determination to complete the task. According to their respective familiar business natures, they decided that Song Ligang would be in charge of machinery, and Li Liankui would be in charge of car dispatch, and quickly began work. Skilled drivers Yang Jingtang, Guo Zhanxiang, Xia Qizhen and others quickly checked the locomotives that were still intact and found some coal nearby. Because they could not find firewood, they used the oil lines inside the locomotive axles and dipped them in heavy oil to light the fire, piecing it together to light the first locomotive at 10:30 p.m. Because there was not enough water, they drew water from another locomotive. At this time, they also found Li Jiuchen, a worker from the original South Station who managed passenger transportation, in a basement, and with Li leading the way, they found Wang Hongren, a transportation assistant, and Su Fuyan, who copied car numbers, and worked together to help rush the transportation. At midnight, the first train left, but there were no signals along the way and the telephone was out of order. There were no air hoses on the cars, making it difficult to stop, and they did not know whether the route had been damaged, so they drove cautiously and contacted each station, and finally no accidents occurred. After the first train left, Li Jiuchen found nine railway employees, including switchmen and car inspectors, who were familiar with the route, and everyone continued to add coal, water, and fire with manpower in the bitter cold wind, and then drove out two more trains. That night, a total of more than ninety railcars of important materials were transferred. The sixteen employees from Harbin had traveled a long distance without rest and had not eaten for a day and a night, but they still worked hard for the public, forgetting their own needs. This greatly moved the newly liberated Shenyang railway employees. The next day (the 4th), most of the employees from the original station arrived, and the entire task of rushing the transportation was quickly completed.

　　哈沈路工宋力纲等奋勇抢运缴获物资
    沈市军管会通令嘉奖
    【新华社沈阳十八日电】沈阳军管会顷发出通令，嘉奖于上月三日夜间（沈阳解放的第二天）在南站奋勇抢运缴获物资的宋力纲等十六位铁路员工。当时，该站有一千一百多辆车皮散乱在一百三十多条线路上，其中约有四百个车皮满装重要物资。为了避免遭敌人破坏，军管会决定把这些物资迅速疏散到安全地区。这个紧急的艰巨任务经过哈尔滨来的十六位铁路员工工头并团结原来车站的工友整夜抢运，终于胜利地完成了。是日夜，车站没有电，到处是一片漆黑。满地都是歪倒的电杆和散乱的电线，还有未扫除的地雷，上着引火帽的炮弹，揭开了盖的手榴弹。工人们暗中摸索了很久才找着了两台机车，但是又缺煤少水，无法开动。再加线路不熟，一切电气信号失明，到处是电力装置的道岔，就是机车开动了也很难出站。但这些困难并不能动摇工人们完成任务的决心。他们根据原来各人熟悉的业务性质，决定宋力纲管机务，李连奎管车务调度，迅速开始工作。熟练的司机杨景堂、郭占祥、夏其祯等，很快的检查了尚属完好的机车，从附近弄来一部分煤。因为找不到木柴，便用机车轴内的油线再醮以重油点火，七拼八凑的于十时半点着了第一台机车。因水不够，便抽用另一车头的水。这时，他们又在一个地下室里找到了原来南站管理旅客运转的工友李久臣，并由李领着找到了运转助手王鸿仁和抄车号码的苏福言，合力帮助抢运。午夜零时，第一列车开出了，但沿路没有信号，电话不通。车箱上没有风管子，停车不便，又不了解路线有无破坏，他们就谨慎地行驶，逐站联系，终于没有发生任何事故。第一列车开走后，李久臣又找到了熟悉线路的搬道工友和检车员等九位铁路员工，大家在凛冽寒风中，继续用人力添煤上水升火，又接连开出两列车。这一夜先后共转移出九十余车箱的重要物资。从哈尔滨来的十六个员工，经过长途行军没有休息，又一昼夜没有吃饭，但仍为公忘私努力工作。这使新解放的沈阳铁路员工很受感动。第二天（四日）原来车站的员工们大部到齐，全部抢运任务得以迅速完成。
