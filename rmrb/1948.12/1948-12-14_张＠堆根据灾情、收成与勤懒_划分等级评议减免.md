Zhang＠Dui Divides Levels for Tax Reduction Evaluation Based on Disaster Situation, Harvest, and Diligence

[This Newspaper] JiluYu Yunju Seventh District, Zhang＠Dui, during the autumn tax collection, divided levels for tax reduction evaluation based on various factors such as the severity of flooding, the quality of the harvest, the availability of labor, and the degree of production activity. This was then submitted for mass discussion and a final decision was made. The masses were very satisfied. The village has a total of 345 households with 1,373 people. After the village cadres attended a meeting in the district, they returned to the village and convened a mass meeting to convey the autumn tax collection work and elected eleven evaluation committee members on the spot to be responsible for the autumn tax collection work. During the registration, 80 mu of hidden land were discovered. Because the propaganda and education work was relatively thorough, the masses understood the importance of this year's autumn tax collection. On the other hand, this year's harvest was not good, and it was necessary to correctly implement tax reductions, which the village also handled with relative caution. When conducting the evaluation, the levels were divided based on flooding, harvest, labor, and production (i.e., diligence). The first level was 24 households, all of whom met all five criteria. The second level was 33 households, who after paying public grain, had less than 100 jin of grain per person, with a 30% reduction. After this discussion and resolution, it was read to everyone at the village-wide mass meeting on the evening of the 8th. At this time, several households raised different opinions. For example, the military dependent ××× said, "I have 18.5 mu of land for six people and harvested nine bags of grain. Why aren't you reducing mine?" Immediately, some of the masses stood up to argue, "You planted seven mu of millet and harvested eight bags, two and a half mu of sorghum and harvested three bags, one and a half mu of sweet potatoes, and one mu of indigo. You are stronger than anyone else, and you shouldn't get a reduction." Then a man named Er Banzi raised the issue, "I have two people and only harvested two bags of grain. Shouldn't you reduce mine?" Many people said, "No! You don't produce properly, let's discuss it again!" In this way, after a heated debate among the masses, repeated for a total of five meetings, the masses finally had no objections.

[This Newspaper] JiluYu Yuncheng Fifth District, Dongliangdian, when assigning autumn tax collection tasks, some of the masses asked for more reductions. However, the branch party members recognized the current victorious situation and the importance of guaranteeing support for the front lines, and were determined to overcome all difficulties and guarantee the completion of the autumn tax collection tasks. Therefore, they first convened a party member meeting to solve the problem of reductions in the autumn tax collection. It was proposed that egalitarianism should not be committed and that reductions should be guaranteed to poor military dependents, revolutionary martyrs' families, and poor people without labor. The village has a total of 160 households, bearing 16 qing of land, with 19 jin per mu. The district controlled the reduction by 20%. Based on this situation, they studied each household and launched a heated discussion. When Liang Yanzhang was mentioned, everyone said that he was blind and had no labor force. Although the flooding was not severe, his life was very difficult and he could be reduced a bit. Later, when a middle peasant family was mentioned, with 20 mu of land all flooded, everyone said that even though they were middle peasants, they should be reduced even if they didn't collect grain. Finally, when the reduction for party member ×× was discussed, everyone said to let him report himself first! He said, "Eleven mu of my thirteen mu of land were flooded. I can't be higher than the masses, let's reduce 100 jin!" Everyone felt that this was the case and agreed with his opinion. In this way, they carefully discussed and evaluated all 160 households in the village all night long. Finally, Branch Secretary ××× said, "This is only the preliminary opinion of our branch, and it must be discussed and deliberated by the masses for the final decision." (It is very good that the branch pays attention to specific leadership in the autumn tax collection. However, the autumn tax collection should be presided over by the village government and the evaluation committee members, and the party members can use persuasive methods to achieve branch leadership. This village has a tendency to monopolize, which must be paid attention to. --Editor)

    张＠堆根据灾情、收成与勤懒
    划分等级评议减免
    【本报讯】冀鲁豫郓巨七区张＠堆在秋征中，根据水淹轻重，收成好坏，劳力有无，生产积极与否等方面情形划分等级，评议减免，然后再交群众讨论，作出最后决定，群众都很满意。该村共三百四十五户，一千三百七十三口人，村干在区开过会后，回村即召开了群众大会，传达秋征工作，并当场选出了十一个评议委员，负责掌握秋征工作。在登记中，就找出黑地八十亩。由于宣传教育工作比较深入，使群众了解今年秋征的重要。另一方面，今年收成不好，还必须正确地执行减免，该村也作得比较慎重。进行评议时，是根据水淹、收成、劳力、生产（即勤懒）等方面来划分等级。第一等二十四户，这五方面都全占得住，第二等三十三户，是交公粮后，每人还合一百斤粮食以下的减免百分之三十。经过这样讨论决议后，于八日晚在全村群众大会上，念给大家听。此时有几户提出不同意见。如军属×××说：“我六口人十八亩半地，收了九布袋粮食，为啥不减我的呀？”当即有的群众起来辩驳说：“你种七亩谷子，收了八布袋，二亩半高粱，收了三布袋，一亩半红薯，还有一亩靛，你比谁都强，该不着减免。”接着又有一个叫二半子的提出：“我两口人，只收了两布袋粮食，该减我的不？”很多群众说：“不行！你不好好生产，讨论讨论再说吧！”就这样经过群众热烈的争论，反复共五次会议，最后群众才没有意见。
    【本报讯】冀鲁豫郓城五区东梁店，在布置秋征任务时，有些群众要求多减免些。但支部党员同志，认清了当前胜利形势，和保证支援前线的重要，并在思想上下定决心克服一切困难，保证完成秋征任务，因此他们首先召开党员大会，解决秋征中的减免问题。提出不犯平均主义，一定保证减免到贫苦军工烈属，及无劳力的贫苦群众身上。该村共一百六十户，负担地十六顷，每亩十九斤，区按百分之廿的减数，掌握减免。他们就根据这一情况，逐户研究并展开热烈讨论。如提到梁衍章时，都说他是个瞎子，无劳动力，虽然淹的不多，但生活很苦，可以减点。后又提到一家中农，二十亩地全被淹了，大家说是中农，没收粮食也得减免，最后讨论到党员××的减免时，大家说先叫他自报一下吧！他说：“我十三亩地淹了十一亩，咱也不能高于群众，减一百斤吧！”大家感觉也是这样，同意了他的意见。他们就这样认真讨论了一个通宵，完全把全村一百六十户评议完。最后支书×××说：“这仅是咱支部的初步意见，还得经群众讨论酝酿作最后决定”。（支部注意具体领导秋征，是很好的。但是，应由村政权及评议员去主持秋征，党员可在其中用说服办法，实现支部领导。这个村，支部有包办倾向，须注意。——编者）
