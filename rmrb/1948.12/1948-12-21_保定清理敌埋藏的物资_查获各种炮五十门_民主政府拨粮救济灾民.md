　　【Jizhong Telegram】 After the liberation of Baoding City, initial achievements have been made in clearing out enemy materials. According to preliminary statistics, 53 pieces of various artillery, 73 light and heavy machine guns, more than 4,000 submachine guns and rifles, more than 210,000 rounds of ammunition, more than 1,600 artillery shells, 45 automobiles, 6 locomotives, 2 damaged airplanes, more than 130 telephones, more than 27,000 items of bedding, more than one million catties of grain and white flour, and 97,000 catties of edible salt have been found; and there are many other materials. During the clearing process, many workers and citizens voluntarily reported to the democratic government the firearms and materials hidden by the fleeing Fu bandits. The worker Yu Wenbing reported all the grain and gasoline stored by the enemy. Gao Zhendong, a water carrier, voluntarily handed over six boxes of Western medicine and two large boxes of electrical equipment hidden by the bandit army. Yang Chungui, a soldier of the puppet Hebei Security 36th Regiment, threw a light machine gun and two boxes of ammunition into a well when Liu bandit fled, and ran home. After the liberation of Baoding, he immediately reported to the district government and took them out. The government gave rewards to those who voluntarily handed over or reported the materials hidden by the enemy.
　　【Jizhong Telegram】The Baoding Military Control Commission allocated 100,000 catties of emergency relief grain on December 7 to relieve the poor disaster victims in the city who were orphaned, widowed, disabled, and unable to produce. After the long-term oppression by the enemy and the burning, killing and looting by Liu bandit before fleeing south, many people in the city are unable to make a living. Of the city's 20,790 households, about 10 percent are in urgent need of relief. Regarding the methods of distributing relief grain, the Military Control Commission stipulates that the main targets of relief are poor, orphaned, widowed, disabled, and labor-free disaster victims. For disaster victims with labor ability, they will be helped to carry out production, or introduced to bank loans or work-for-relief programs, to prevent the idea of simply relying on relief. The city's Social Affairs Bureau is working with the governments of various districts and streets to go deep into the disaster-stricken households and carry out investigations and distributions with emphasis.

　　保定清理敌埋藏的物资
    查获各种炮五十门
    民主政府拨粮救济灾民
    【冀中电】保定市解放后，清理敌人物资已获初步成绩。据初步统计，已查出者有各种炮五十三门，轻重机枪七十三挺，冲锋枪及长短枪四千余支，子弹二十一万余发，炮弹一千六百余发，汽车四十五辆，火车头六个，坏飞机两架，电话机一百三十余部，被服二万七千余件，粮食及白面百余万斤，食盐九万七千斤；其他物资甚多。在清查中，许多工人和市民自动向民主政府报告傅匪逃窜前隐藏的军火物资。工人于文炳把敌所储存的粮食和汽油等物均报告出来。挑水工人高振东自动交出匪军所藏之六箱西药和两大箱电料器材。伪河北保安第三十六团士兵杨春贵，在刘匪逃窜时，把一挺轻机枪和两箱子弹投在井里，逃跑回家，保定解放后，他立即报告了区政府取了出来。政府对自动交出或报告敌人隐藏之物资者，均分别予以奖励。
    【冀中电】保定军事管制委员会，于十二月七日拨发急赈粮十万斤，救济市内孤寡残废无生产能力的贫苦灾民。该市市民经敌人长期压榨及刘匪化南逃窜前的烧杀劫掠，许多人已生活无着。全市二万零七百九十户，急待救济的约占百分之十。关于发放赈粮办法军管会规定：救济对象，主要是贫苦的孤寡残废的无劳动力的灾民，对有劳动力灾民则帮助其进行生产，或介绍到银行贷款或以工代赈，防止单纯依靠救济的思想。该市社会局正联合各区街政府深入灾户，有重点的随调查随发放。
