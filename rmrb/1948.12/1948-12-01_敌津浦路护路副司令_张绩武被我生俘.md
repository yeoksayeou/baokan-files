Xinhua News Agency, Huaihai Front, 28th. Zhang Jiwu, Deputy Commander of the Jiang bandit Jinpu Railway Protection Command and Supreme Commander of the enemy forces guarding Su County, was captured in the battle to liberate Su County by our army.

On the evening of the 15th, at about 11 o'clock, the majority of the enemy forces defending Su County had been annihilated. Two remaining pockets of enemy resistance, holed up in the electric light factory and the Gospel Hall, surrendered their weapons shortly after. Zhang Jiwu, the overall commander of the Su County defenders, disguised himself as Fang Xiaoxi and mingled among the prisoners. Only after our staff questioned his captured subordinates was it revealed that Fang Xiaoxi was actually Zhang Jiwu. When a comrade from our army's political department called out the name Fang Xiaoxi, a thin, short man, wearing a set of ordinary officer's clothing and a yellow military overcoat tightly wrapped around his body, emerged from the chaotic crowd. His eyes were bloodshot red, and there was a patch of black smeared next to his nose. He claimed to be a lieutenant secretary from the Shangqiu Barracks Management Office. In his response, he fabricated a story about how he had come from Shangqiu and was preparing to go to Nanjing. After being exposed by our army comrades, he said dejectedly, "Since you have found out so clearly, what choice do I have but to admit it?" Zhang Jiwu is a native of Luotian, Hubei, 44 years old, and a graduate of the Wuhan branch of the Central Military Academy, Class Seven. He originally served as the commander of the Second Traffic Police Regiment. In October of this year, after the Jiang bandits established the Jinpu Railway Protection Command in Guzhen, he was promoted to deputy commander. At the start of the Huaihai Campaign, he was appointed as the supreme commander of the Su County defenders, commanding the Second and Sixteenth Traffic Police Regiments, as well as the 148th Division.

Xinhua News Agency, Huaihai Front, 29th. Frontline reporters report that during the battle to liberate Su County, our army marched rapidly and arrived directly under the walls of Su County on November 13th, occupying the South Gate and the West Gate. Simultaneously, another unit of the Liberation Army had already occupied Fuli Ji to the north of the city and Guzhen to the south of the city, completely isolating the enemy in Su County. Our army then proceeded to launch an operation to seize the East Gate. The East Gate of Su County stretches for more than three li. At the eastern end of the East Gate, during the Japanese occupation, a new barracks with a circumference of about three li was built. In addition, there was an old barracks and the Su County Railway Station on the Jinpu Railway, which became the enemy's solid strongholds on the periphery of Su County. On the evening of the 14th, a unit of our army attacked the old Japanese barracks from the east, capturing more than 40 enemies. They then took advantage of the victory to advance along the East Gate Street towards the city walls. The enemy launched a counterattack with a train of armored vehicles and six armored cars, but under the grenade explosions and rocket fire of our brave soldiers, the enemy armored train was destroyed, and all six armored cars fled in panic into the city. When the enemy retreated into the city, attempting to prevent our pursuit, they set fire to the civilian houses in the East Gate. Our commanders and fighters were extremely indignant about this. In addition to dispatching some combat troops to brave the artillery fire to rescue the people, they all rushed directly to the city walls with fierce courage. Another unit of our army also wiped out the enemy guarding the station. At 5 p.m. on the 15th, our army began attacking the city from the east and west. The moat around Su County was more than three zhang wide and the water was over one's head. When we began to seize the passes, the enemy completely destroyed the bridges on the north, south, and west sides. Our main attacking force on the west side first encountered difficulties in building a bridge. In order to solve this problem, cadres at all levels of the unit, down to the group leaders, personally went to the bridgehead to reconnoiter the terrain and fully exercised military democracy. The Seventh Company, which was responsible for building the bridge, held discussions, exercises, and studies for a whole day on the 14th, and came up with a method of forming a bridge-building team of six people. When the attack began, the bridge-building heroes of the Seventh Company completed the enemy-front bridge construction in a very short time under the cover of our artillery fire. Because the bridge outside the East Gate was not completely destroyed by the enemy due to our brave pursuit, the advance of the main attacking force on the East Gate was even smoother. After fifteen minutes of fierce bombardment, our artillery unit opened a gap more than one zhang wide in the Little East Gate. Huang Bingzhi and the other nine heroes of the Ninth Platoon of a certain unit, who were responsible for the assault, were the first to climb the city wall. From the artillery bombardment to the breakthrough of the city wall, it took only forty minutes. After breaking through the city wall, the east and west routes advanced simultaneously towards the enemy's depths in the cross street, leaving the enemies on both sides aside, suppressing the enemy's stubborn resistance and the armored car counterattacks. At about 10 o'clock, the fraternal units on the east and west routes joined forces in the center of the street, and then divided and surrounded the remaining pockets of enemy resistance in the electric light factory and the Gospel Hall. The remaining enemy forces in the electric light factory were captured first, and the remaining forces led by Zhang Jiwu, the supreme commander of the defenders, compressed in the Gospel Hall, also surrendered their weapons. It was midnight, and the whole city resounded with the sounds of weapons being surrendered and the cheers of victory. More than ten thousand enemy troops were all annihilated without a single one escaping. Su County, the key point between Xuzhou and Bengbu, was thus liberated.

　　敌津浦路护路副司令
  　张绩武被我生俘
    【新华社淮海前线廿八日电】蒋匪津浦路护路司令部副司令兼宿县守敌最高指挥官张绩武，于我军解放宿县之战中被俘。十五日晚十一时许，宿县城内守敌已大部就歼，困守在电灯厂和福音堂仍图顽抗的两股残敌，不久也先后缴了枪。宿县守敌的总指挥官张绩武化名方晓兮，混杂在这批俘虏群中，经我工作人员询问其被俘的部下时，始知方晓兮即是张绩武。当我军政治部某同志高喊方晓兮的名字时，从杂乱的人群中走出了一个穿着一套普通官佐服和一件黄色军大衣紧紧的裹着身子的瘦矮个子，眼睛充血通红，鼻子旁边不知怎么涂上一块黑，自称是商邱兵营管理所的中尉书记。在答话中，他胡诌了一篇如何由商邱出来，准备到南京去的鬼话。后来经我军工作同志揭破之后，他始颓丧地说：“你们既已搞得这样清楚，我还有什么办法不承认。”张绩武系湖北罗田人，四十四岁，中央军校武汉分校七期毕业，原任交警二总队总队长，今年十月蒋匪成立津浦路护路司令部于固镇，始升任副司令。淮海战役开始，被任为宿县守敌最高指挥官，指挥交警第二、第十六两个总队及一四八师。
    【新华社淮海前线二十九日电】前线记者报导我军解放宿县战斗经过称：十一月十三日，我军以急行军直达宿县城下，占领南关与西关。同时另部解放军已占领城北之符离集及城南之固镇，使宿县之敌完全孤立。我军随即进行夺取东关的作战。宿县东关长达三里许，东关东头在日寇占领时期曾筑有一方圆三里许之新兵营，此外尚有一旧兵营与津浦路宿县车站，成为宿县敌之外围坚固据点。十四日晚，我军某部自东面攻入旧日寇兵营，俘敌四十余后，乘胜沿东关大街向城根推进。敌人曾以铁甲车一列、装甲汽车六辆向我反攻，但在我勇士们的手榴弹爆炸与火箭炮射击之下，敌铁甲车被打毁，六辆装甲汽车均仓皇逃入城内。当敌人退入城内时，妄图阻我追击，竟纵火焚烧东关民房。我军指战员对此愤慨万分，除拨出一部作战部队冒着炮火替人民救火外，一齐猛勇地直扑城根。另部我军亦将车站守敌肃清。十五日下午五时，我军从东西两面开始攻城。宿县环城沟壕宽约三丈余，水深没顶。在我开始夺关时，敌人即将南北西三面桥梁完全破坏。我主攻西城部队首先遇到架桥困难。为了解决这个问题，该部各级干部直至小组长均亲临桥头侦察地形，充分地发挥了军事民主。担任架桥的七连，于十四日一天讨论、演习、研究后，得出了以六个人组成架桥组架桥的办法。攻城开始，七连的架桥英雄在我炮火掩护下，以极短时间完成敌前架桥。东关外桥梁因我追击勇猛，敌未及彻底破坏，故主攻东关部队发展更为顺利。我炮兵部队经十五分钟猛烈轰击，即将小东关打开一丈多宽的缺口。担任突击的某部二连九班黄炳志等九位英雄，首先登上城墙，从炮火轰击至突破城垣，历时仅四十分钟。东西两路在突破城墙之后，齐向十字街心敌人纵深发展，将两侧之敌抛在一边，压制了敌人顽强抵抗及装甲车的反扑。十时许，东西两路兄弟部队会师街心，随即将各股残敌分割包围在电灯厂和福音堂内。电灯厂的残敌先作了俘虏，被压缩在福音堂的守敌最高指挥官张绩武所率残部，亦接着缴了械。时值午夜，全城喧嚷着一片缴枪声和胜利的欢呼。万余敌军全部歼灭无一漏网。徐州蚌埠间的要点宿县城遂告解放。
