　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, December 17th: TASS reports: Marinin, in Pravda, commented on the results of the current session of the United Nations General Assembly, writing: The United Nations General Assembly in Paris has been in session for nearly three months. The representatives of the US-British bloc's intentions and the direction of their efforts are perfectly clear. In the three months of meetings, the guiding principle of the many clumsy conspiracies of US-British diplomats has been to try to abolish the United Nations as an international cooperation organization and turn it into a docile tool of dollar diplomacy. Without a doubt, one of the most important achievements of this session of the General Assembly has been to expose the US and British conspiracies against the United Nations, against the principles of the United Nations, and against the Charter. The US-British bloc's sabotage activities at the Paris General Assembly developed along several lines, namely, their attempt to use the United Nations institutions as a smokescreen for their arms race policy; their sabotage was mainly directed against the main body for peace and international cooperation—the Security Council. The Paris meeting also proved that the US-British bloc is trying to reduce the United Nations to a registration body, registering illegal collusion and actions in blatant violation of the United Nations Charter after they occur. The Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries opposed this policy with a program of peace and international cooperation on a democratic basis. This program is in line with the wishes and interests of all peace-loving people. The primary result of the Third United Nations General Assembly is the moral and political victory of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries.

  　美英利用联大掩护扩军遭到世界人民坚强反对
    【新华社陕北十七日电】塔斯社讯：马里宁在真理报上论及联合国本届大会之结果时写道：巴黎联合国大会议开了近三个月。美英集团的代表们所企图要作的以及他们努力的方向是完全明白的。在三个月的集会中，美英外交官们的许多笨拙的阴谋的指导方针，便是努力废除联合国这个国际合作机构，把它变成金元外交的驯顺工具。毫无疑问的，本届大会的最重要的成果之一，便是揭穿了美、英反对联合国、反对联合国原则和宪章的阴谋。美英集团在巴黎联大会议上的破坏活动沿着几个方向发展，即它们企图使用联合国机构作为他们军备竞赛政策的烟幕；它们的破坏活动主要地是针对着争取和平与国际合作的主要机构——安理会。巴黎的会议又证明，美英集团企图把联合国降为一个注册机关，在公然违反联合国宪章的非法勾当与行动发生后，把它们登记一下。苏联和人民民主国家以民主基础上的和平与国际合作的纲领，反对这种政策。这一纲领符合一切爱好和平的人民的愿望与利益。第三届联合国大会的首要结果，是苏联与人民民主国家道义上和政治上的胜利。
