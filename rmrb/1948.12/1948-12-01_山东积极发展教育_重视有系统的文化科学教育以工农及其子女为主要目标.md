Xinhua News Agency, East China, 22nd: Since the provincial education conference was held in September, Shandong Province's educational work is being actively restored and developed. The important achievement of this education conference was, first, the establishment of a New Democratic ideological viewpoint in educational policy, educating the children of all classes of people to serve the masses, and making the broad masses of workers and peasants and their children the primary goal of education in the future. Secondly, in terms of educational content, it was determined that it should be formulated based on the local political, economic, and cultural foundations, current tasks, and the needs of various work; attention should be paid to the education of systematic cultural and scientific knowledge, and at the same time, real struggle materials should be absorbed to enrich the educational content, seeking to make it useful for learning. Regarding the various systems in educational work, the conference believed that various formal systems should be established from actual conditions, overcoming the past phenomenon of student mobility and guerrillaism in educational work, but at the same time preventing formalism in regularization. In addition, the conference made specific plans for the restoration and reorganization of schools at all levels, as well as rewarding poor youth to study, developing social education, and teachers' treatment. In the nearly two months since the end of the education conference, provincial universities and middle schools in Shandong have shown a vigorous atmosphere. More than a thousand people have applied to the East China University in the month since its establishment, and more than 700 have been admitted, including students from Qingdao, Tianjin and other places. The school is divided into undergraduate and preparatory departments. The undergraduate department currently has a department of political economy, a department of literature and art, and a college of education, which will start classes soon. Shandong Provincial Agricultural College officially opened on October 15th, with three departments temporarily set up: agriculture and forestry, cooperation, and water conservancy, and a preparatory course is also provided. The study period for each department is one year. Qingzhou Middle School held a new student examination on October 20th, with more than 1,400 applicants, of which 650 have been admitted, and officially started school on the 10th of this month. The school also has a short-term normal class to train primary school teachers and local education work cadres. In the Jiaodong area, except for the newly recovered areas such as Yantai, it has been decided to restore nine middle schools (including one normal school), and recruitment is underway and will start school soon. The Bohai area has also decided to restore five middle schools and open one senior normal school. Zibo Middle School, Tai'an Middle School, and Binhai Middle School in the central and southern Shandong areas are currently recruiting new students. Middle schools in Jining and Yanzhou have started classes. Qufu Normal School and Luzhong Middle School are also actively preparing.
