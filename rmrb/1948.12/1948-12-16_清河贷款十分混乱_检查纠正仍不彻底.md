(Jinan Telegram) Qinghe is inspecting the autumn loan issuance and collection work, preparing to vigorously support winter sideline production. The county issued 40 million yuan in loans in August, but due to a lack of clarity regarding the direction of production development, many errors occurred in the loan process. Before issuing the loans, the county bank had no plan or purpose, and blindly publicized it in the county newspaper, calling on all county merchants to receive loans. During distribution, it did not ask about need and gave an average of 200,000 yuan to each person. In this way, it was snatched up by three or four villages in just four days. Some villages that came late didn't get a single cent. Regarding the loan method, it was neither done through the districts and villages, nor was it well grasped by the cadres, so many deviations occurred. Zhao Zhihong of Huangjinzhuang falsely used four names and borrowed more than 600,000 yuan. Zhang Lupo, Zhang Wanrong, and Xie Yuling used five names to fraudulently obtain loans, falsely claiming to jointly open an oil press. In other villages, many people took out two loans per person. Some cadres of the county bank used the loans to cultivate personal relationships and secretly gave more loans to relatives and friends. There were also cases of sending letters to their own village and family members in advance. One village received more than 9 million yuan before it was even announced, causing widespread dissatisfaction among cadres and the masses. During the loan collection in September and October, there was also a failure to conduct timely inspection and control, so that some villages still have not been able to repay them to this day. According to village cadre reports, the villages are poor, but when cadres were sent to inspect on November 15th and borrowers were called in for face-to-face talks, they all said that the money had been handed over more than a month ago. Cai Village's village chief and Farmers' Association chairman in the Third District privately engaged in business after collecting the loans. In Bijiawa Village in the Fifth District, most of the two loan installments fell into the hands of the village cadres. When the masses wanted to repay the loans, the village cadres refused to allow it, claiming to their superiors that the masses were having difficulties, thus delaying the loan collection time. After the county bank discovered the above problems, it did not deal with them in a timely manner. Although inspections and mutual criticism were carried out among the cadres, allowing everyone to recognize the error of selfish and self-interested viewpoints of always thinking of themselves, and resolving to correct them; however, the leadership did not inspect the principle errors in the August loan policy, nor did it conduct in-depth ideological inspections. Therefore, when discussing and deciding on the policy and plan for winter sideline loans, the purpose was still not clear, and the plan only mentioned that the focus must be on oil presses and flour mills related to agriculture. As for which oil presses and flour mills the sideline loans should focus on supporting, whether they are privately operated or cooperatively operated, it has not yet been clearly stipulated. These all need to be further studied and determined.

### 清河贷款十分混乱　检查纠正仍不彻底

　　清河贷款十分混乱
  　检查纠正仍不彻底
    【冀南电】清河检查秋季发贷、收贷工作，准备大力扶助冬季副业生产。该县八月份曾发贷四千万元，但由于对发展生产的方针不明确，贷款发生许多错误。发贷之前，县银行既无计划，又无目的，盲目的在县小报上宣传，号召全县商人来领贷款。分发时，不问需要与否，平均每人二十万元。这样没过四天，即被三、四个村抢贷完毕。有些村来的晚了，就一文也摸不着。在贷款方式上，既不通过区村，干部又没很好掌握，因此出了不少偏差。黄金庄赵志红冒顶四个人名，贷了六十多万元。张吕坡、张万荣、谢玉岭顶着五个人名冒领贷款，假说伙开油房。其他村一人领两份者，多不胜举。县银行有的干部就利用贷款拉私情，帮亲友暗中多贷。还有的事前给本村、本家人去信，有一村未宣布前就领了九百多万，引起干群普遍不满。九、十月份收贷时，也未及时检查、掌握，以致至今仍有部分村庄一直未能归还。据村干汇报说是村穷，但十一月十五号派干部去检查，召集贷户面谈时，都说款已交了一个多月了。三区蔡村村长、农会主席收回贷款后私自干买卖，五区毕家洼村两期贷款大部落到村干手里，收贷时群众想交，村干不叫还，对上说群众有困难，拖延收贷时间。县银行发现以上问题后，并未及时处理，虽然在干部间进行了检查与互相批评，使大家认识了处处为个人打算的自私自利观点的错误，并下定决心改正；但领导上并未检查八月份贷款方针上的原则错误，也未从思想上作深入检查。因此在讨论与决定冬季副业贷款的方针、计划时，目的仍未明确，计划中也仅提到重点一定放在与农业有关的油房、粉房上去。至于副业贷款的重点是扶植什么油房，什么粉房，是私人经营的，还是合作互助经营的呢？仍未明确规定。这些都需要继续研究确定。
