　　To Overcome the "Impatience" That Hinders Progress
    Yì Dáměi
    I've always been puzzled by this: "Why can't I make progress? What should I do to improve?" I wanted to improve, but I didn't know where to start, what to focus on first. I thought about it during the day, and pondered it at night, feeling unhappy about it all day long. Whenever I thought of it, I felt a fire in my heart. I felt sad and ashamed. After two or three years of revolutionary education, I still have many shortcomings: being impractical, vain, petty… The words of my teacher, the hopeful face of my mother, the sincere heart of my brother and friends, often came to mind, but I was always sluggish and tired. I truly felt sorry for them! The more anxious I was, the less I could calm down and rationally consider the problem. Now, I understand why I sometimes feel down. For example, when I'm criticized, I feel bad, everything seems unpleasant, and I don't trust myself, thinking I'm beyond redemption. Why do I make mistakes when others don't? "This shows I'm useless." After drawing this conclusion, I despise myself even more. And after despising myself, I feel like an outcast, ignored by my peers, making me even more pessimistic and disappointed. In fact, these are all misguided thoughts, adding to my mental burden. Why do I know this now? After this marching assessment, I became emotional again because I have many shortcomings, and I had the same thoughts as before, subjectively believing that Zhao Enxin was dissatisfied with me and would no longer actively help me in the future. So, I felt sad and regretful all day long, but I didn't cheer up, learn from past experiences, and humbly correct my mistakes in the future. Soon, the facts proved that I couldn't withstand tests and that I was incredibly narrow-minded. Later, a conversation with Zhao Enxin made me understand that she didn't see me that way at all. Her words sparked my confidence and made me feel especially ashamed of my incorrect emotions in the past few days. She said, "This assessment gave you criticism, and I agree with this criticism. It's precisely because I want to help you, precisely because I don't think you're beyond redemption, that I have high expectations for you. You should feel honored that others have high expectations for you." This sentence, just this one sentence, was like a beam of strong light shining into the depths of my heart, arousing my memories, my alertness, and indescribable excitement! I recalled the past, always feeling that some people didn't think I was worth paying attention to, or even that I was completely worthless. But today, someone actually looks at me this way! How hard should I work! It shows I still have hope. This sentence is what I needed most and truly understood: "To feel honored that others have high expectations for you." During the period when I was emotional, I thought the opposite of this sentence. On the one hand, I felt sad about my slow progress, and on the other hand, I thought it was unreasonable for others to have high expectations for me. Thinking about it now, how naive I was!

    From then on, I cheered up, feeling so happy every day. However, gradually, I began to doubt my progress again, still feeling that I was progressing too slowly and not achieving anything. This caused my thoughts to stagnate again. But, during a recent minor illness, Li Li's words reminded me. She said, "The success of any successful person is never accidental. It comes from arduous struggles and being tempered in hardship." That's right, only by experiencing, exploring, and carefully observing everything that is constantly developing around us in real life, and using this as a warning for our actions, can we gain the most valuable harvest and constantly progress. Now, I've only just reached a new starting point and want to become a complete person, which is completely impossible. This is just frivolousness and impatience.

    So, to bring it all back, in the past I was suffering from "impatience." I had overly high expectations for everything, but I couldn't live up to them. I wanted to make progress and achieve my goals, to solve problems in all aspects. This is like what the great Soviet biologist Pavlov said in his last words to young people, "blowing soap bubbles." I made a little progress and wanted to be praised everywhere. As a result, once the soap bubble burst, I felt lost and uneasy all day long. Now, after recognizing this, I'm no longer as emotionally unstable as before and can calm down to consider how to start the steps that have been waiting for me to put into practice – concrete actions.

    Now, my mind seems particularly clear. I have specifically formulated a plan for how to do things step by step in the future to achieve my ideal goals and train myself into a truly strong and outstanding builder of the new democratic state. At the same time, I no longer have any fear of difficulties in the future. I no longer think it is impossible to get rid of certain shortcomings.

　　要克服阻碍进步的“急躁”
    易达美
    我老想不透这事：“为什我总进步不了？要怎样才能进步呢？”要求进步，但不知该从那里着手；不知首先该注重什么地方，白天想，夜里念，终日为这事不痛快。一提起它，就从心眼里冒火，我觉得难过、惭愧，受了两三年的革命教养，到今天，仍带有许多毛病：不踏实、虚荣、小心眼………等。先生的话，妈妈的希望的脸，哥哥真挚友谊的心，常涌现出来，然自己又老疲疲踏踏，真对不起他们啊！越着急，越不能静下来理智地考虑问题。现在，我明白了自己有些时候情绪不高的缘故，如刚受了批评，心里就难受，觉得什么事都不顺眼，并且不信任自己，认为自己不可救药。为什么别人不犯错误，偏偏自己就犯了？“由此可见是没出息。”自己给自己下了这个结论后，就更轻视自己了；轻视自己后，倒又好象是个为周围同伴所不理的被弃者，心情更是悲观、失望。其实，这都是想入歧途，自己给自己加重了精神负担。为什么现在我知道了这点呢？在这次行军鉴定后，我又闹情绪了，因为自己有很多缺点，于是又有了前面那种心理，主观地肯定赵恩馨是不满意自己，今后也不会积极帮助我了。就一天到晚难受、后悔，却不振作起精神，好好接受过去经验教训，今后虚心改过。不久事实证明，自己不但经不起考验，而且，胸襟狭小得可怪，因经后来和赵恩馨谈话，使我明白她对我并不是这种看法，她的几句话激起了我的信心，也使我对自己几天来不正确的情绪感到特别惭愧。她说：“这次鉴定给了你一个批评，对这批评我很同意，正因为我对你抱着帮助态度，正因为我没有认为你不可救药，才对你要求严，你应以别人对自己要求严而感到荣幸。”这一句话，仅这一句，就象在黑暗中有一道强光直射到我的心底，激起了我的回忆、我的警觉和说不出的兴奋！我回忆起过去，总是觉得有人认为我不屑重视，甚或简直一无可取；然而今天，居然有人这样的看待我，我应如何的努力啊！可见我仍是有希望的。这句话，才是我最需要、而且了解体验到的：“要以别人对自己要求严而感到荣幸”。在我闹情绪的那一阵，恰好想的和这句相反；我一方面感着自己进步慢而难受，一方面却以别人对自己要求严而认为不合理，如今想来，多幼稚啊！
    从这以后，我振作起来了，每天都是那样的痛快。但，渐渐思想上对自己的进步又有了怀疑，仍感到自己进步太慢，搞什么也没有成绩；为这，又使我在思想上有了停留。不过，在最近一次小病中，李力的话提醒了我，她说：“任何一个成功的人，他的成功绝非偶然，都是经过了艰苦斗争，在苦难中磨炼出来的。”对，只有自己在实际生活中去体验、摸索、细心观察不断在周围发展着的一切，并以此作为自己行动的警钟，才会得到最可贵的收获，才会不断进步。现在，我只不过是刚达到一个新的起点，就想成为一个完整的人，是根本不可能的，这只是轻浮、急躁。
    所以，最后把话说回来，过去自己就是犯了“急躁”病，对任何事都是幻想过高，而力不胜任，说想进步，就愿能达到目的，就各方面都解决问题了，这犹如苏联大生物学家帕夫洛夫同志给青年的遗言中所说的“吹肥皂泡”，有了一点进步，就愿处处受到别人的赞扬，结果，一旦肥皂泡破灭，便如有所失，终日遑遑不安了。现在，认清这点后，我再不象从前那样情绪不定、而能静下来，考虑怎样开始早已在等我去实践的步骤——具体行动。
    现在，脑子也似乎特别清醒，我已具体地订出了计划，今后应怎样按步就班地做去，达到理想的目的，把自己锻炼成一个真正坚强、优秀的新民主主义国家建设者。同时，以后的一切，我对它丝毫没有惧难的心理，不再认为要改掉自己某个缺点是不可能的想法了。
