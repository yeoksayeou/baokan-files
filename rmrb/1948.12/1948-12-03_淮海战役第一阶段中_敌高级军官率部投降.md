Xinhua News Agency, Huaihai Front, 1st - During the first stage of the Huaihai Campaign, under the hammer blows of the People's Liberation Army's powerful offensive, not only did many lower-ranking Kuomintang officers and soldiers collectively lay down their arms and surrender on the battlefield in droves, but also a number of high-ranking officers led their troops to surrender. When the enemy's 107th Army headquarters and its affiliated 260th Division were surrounded by us northwest of Suining, we immediately ordered the army to surrender. The army commander, Sun Liangcheng, along with Deputy Army Commander Wang Qinghan and Chief of Staff Du Futin, personally surrendered to our front-line command post. Outside Nianzhuangwei, Zhao Biguang, commander of the 150th Division of the enemy's 44th Army, led two regimental commanders and more than 2,000 infantrymen to surrender to us voluntarily. Zhao Biguang said, "We could not resist, so we decided to lay down our weapons." When a certain unit of our army approached Qinjialou, on the outskirts of Nianzhuang, on the evening of November 14th, the enemy's 322nd Regiment, 3rd Battalion, deputy battalion commanders Yan Kejian and Wu Jingquan immediately surrendered with one submachine gun and one pistol each. When a certain unit pursued and annihilated the fleeing enemy across the Yunhe River on November 10th, sixty-two enemy officers and soldiers had already gathered automatically on the banks of the Yunhe River requesting to surrender to us. A platoon leader surnamed Wang was chosen as the temporary platoon leader to report to our army, saying, "Among us sixty-two people are from the 64th Army and the 44th Army. We know that the Kuomintang is finished, so we have come to join the People's Liberation Army." In Chuzhuang, north of Nianzhuangwei, an officer from the enemy's 100th Army, 44th Division headquarters, led seventy enemy officers and soldiers of various organizational structures to surrender to us, carrying with them 60mm mortars, light and heavy machine guns, and other weapons. In the battle to encircle and annihilate the enemy's 63rd Army at Yaowan, an entire enemy battalion crossed the river boat by boat to surrender to us.

　　淮海战役第一阶段中
  　敌高级军官率部投降
    【新华社淮海前线一日电】淮海战役第一阶段作战中，在解放军强大攻势的锤击下，战场上不但有很多国民党军的下级军佐及士兵成群结队地集体缴械投诚，并有不少的高级军官率部投降。当敌一零七军军部及所属之二六零师被我包围于睢宁西北时，我即限令该军投降，该军军长孙良诚偕副军长王清翰、参谋长杜辅庭亲至我前线指挥所投降。在碾庄圩外围，敌四十四军一五零师师长赵璧光率两个团长及步兵二千余人自动向我投降。赵璧光说：“我们无法抵抗，所以决心放下武器。”我某部于十一月十四日晚进逼碾庄外围秦家楼时，守敌二十五军三二二团三营正副营长阎克俭、吴景泉即携冲锋枪、手枪各一支来降。某部于十一月十日渡运河追歼逃敌时，运河岸上已自动集结有六十二个敌军官兵请求向我投降，其中一个姓王的排长被推为临时排长来向我军报告说：“我们六十二个人中有六十四军的，有四十四军的，我们知道国民党快完了，特来投奔解放军。”另在碾庄圩北楚庄，敌一百军四十四师师部一个军官，曾率各种不同建制的敌军官兵七十人来向我投诚，并携有六零炮、轻重机枪等武器。在窑湾围歼敌六十三军战斗中，敌军一个整营一船一船地渡过河来向我投降。
