　　Scientifically Using Civilian Labor to Support Large-Scale War
　　North China Unifies and Establishes Logistics Organization
　　Clearly Defines Logistics Agencies and Structures at All Levels
　　[Report from this newspaper] The North China People's Government and the North China Military Region Command have recently jointly decided to establish a unified logistics organization throughout the region. The decision first pointed out that, based on more than two years of experience in logistics work, it is necessary to promote precise calculations, overcome waste, and scientifically and rationally use manpower and materials to support long-term large-scale wars; it is necessary to utilize existing transportation tools in a planned and organized manner, and implement unified large-scale adjustments throughout the region, in order to overcome the contradiction between large-scale mobile warfare and siege warfare and the backward transportation tools of the decentralized small-scale peasant economy; it is necessary to have strict confiscation, takeover, and distribution of captured materials in order to effectively utilize the manpower and materials captured from the enemy. Therefore, it was decided to organize a unified logistics organization in the entire North China region.
　　The specific organizational methods for unified logistics are determined as follows: (1) From the military region to the village, unified logistics departments should be organized under the leadership of the people's governments and military region leaders at all levels. At the level of secondary military regions and above, the military will be the main body, while at the level of military sub-districts and below, the local government will be the main body. The commander, political commissar, and deputy commander and deputy political commissar of logistics at all levels above the military sub-district shall be concurrently held by appropriate personnel selected from the military, government, and civilian cadres at all levels, and full-time personnel may be appointed when necessary. The director and political commissar of the logistics command at the county level shall be concurrently held by the county head and other responsible cadres. The director and deputy director of the logistics command at the district and village levels shall be respectively held by the district head and village head, and the director of the farmers' association. The organization of the logistics department is as follows: A. At the level of secondary military regions and above, a logistics command shall be established under the direct leadership of the military region leaders, with one commander, one political commissar, and one chief of staff, and several staff officers. B. The original supply, health, station, ordnance, and other departments of the troops shall be placed under the establishment of the logistics department. C. Departments in the government, military, civilian, and other sectors that are directly related to war-time logistics work shall be absorbed into the logistics organization without separating them from their original organizations, and shall be divided into mobilization and supply departments according to their nature. The mobilization department shall be based on the people's armed forces department, plus cadres assigned by people's organizations and civil affairs departments, with responsible cadres from the armed forces department concurrently holding key positions. The office shall be located in the armed forces department, responsible for the mobilization, organization, training, and adjustment of war service burdens of manpower and animal power, and inspection of illegal mobilization. The supply department shall be composed of the troop supply department and government finance and industry and commerce departments, with cadres assigned by the finance department concurrently holding key positions. The office shall be located in the finance department, responsible for planning food, firewood, charcoal, vegetables, oil, salt, military shoes, combat equipment, stabilizing battlefield prices, and controlling the use and exchange of currency in new areas. Below the military sub-district level, a propaganda department should also be established, with participation from local propaganda and education departments, government education sections, military sub-district political departments, and, when necessary, people's organizations and newspaper offices, responsible for battlefield propaganda, support-the-front education, and organizing consolation activities. (2) The army corps shall establish a unified logistics department (i.e., a branch of the North China Military Region Logistics Department), which shall be under the dual leadership of the Military Region Logistics Department and the army corps leaders. The army corps' supply, health, station, ordnance, civilian labor, and other departments shall all be placed under its establishment. The logistics branch department represents the Military Region Logistics Department in the army corps to handle all issues related to the army corps' logistics work, and to execute the army corps' war-time logistics work. When executing tasks, if the logistics branch department encounters disagreements between the army corps leaders and the military region logistics leaders, it shall act in accordance with the principle that peacetime instructions of the logistics department should be followed, and wartime instructions of the army corps leaders should be followed. (3) In order to unifiedly command war-time logistics work and execute war-time tasks, a joint war-time command should be organized based on the army corps logistics department to control the entire war-time battlefield logistics work. (4) Regarding the determination of several major working relationships: A. The deployment of war-time logistics (including the number of manpower and materials to be used and their allocation, adjustment, and dispatch, and the expenditure of war expenses, etc.) and the determination of relevant principles shall be planned by the commander and political commissar of the Military Region Logistics Department, approved by the North China People's Government, and then executed by the Logistics Department by order. B. Logistics departments at all levels shall work under the direct leadership of the people's governments and military region leaders at all levels, and under the command of the higher-level logistics departments. C. In general, the mobilization of civilian labor, etc., should be arranged level by level according to what is approved by the North China People's Government, so that logistics departments at all levels can better adjust the burden of civilian labor. D. War expenses shall be managed by the Logistics Department in a unified manner, and the work of auditing, approving, and reimbursing shall be handled by the Supply Department in a unified manner.
