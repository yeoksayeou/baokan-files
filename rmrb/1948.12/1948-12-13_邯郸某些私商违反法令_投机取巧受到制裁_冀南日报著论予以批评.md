邯郸 Certain Private Merchants in Handan, Violated Laws, Speculated and Took Advantage, Subjected to Sanctions; Jinnan Daily Publishes Commentary Criticizing Them
[Our Newspaper's Report] Certain privately owned industrial and commercial operators in Handan City, Jinnan, did not seek profits from the legitimate development of their businesses; instead, they fraudulently obtained loans for commercial speculation, or cut corners and adulterated products to seek illicit gains. As a result, speculators lost all their capital, and those who cut corners were exposed. The masses strongly opposed this kind of speculative behavior, and the government is investigating in accordance with the law. The Yifeng Thread Factory in the city was established in February of this year by more than 100 merchants, shop assistants, and workers who pooled their shares, with a total capital of over 1.9 million yuan. The manager, Wang Yaoxian, did not pay attention to developing the business, but instead engaged in commercial speculation. This year, he borrowed 26 million yuan from the bank, not to improve industrial production, but to go to Shijiazhuang to sell foreign yarn in bulk for commercial speculation, hoping to make a fortune. However, he lost 3.5 million yuan. In addition to losing all furniture and funds, he also incurred debts of more than 1 million yuan. Zhongxin Flower Shop (manager Sun Jinghai) and Xinsheng Oil Shop (manager Guo Yuncheng) were affiliated. Zhongxin had a capital of 3 million yuan, and Xinsheng had 1 million yuan. Because the capital was not much, there wasn't much working capital left after repairing the storefronts. The managers of the two shops tried to obtain loans for commercial speculation. Zhongxin Flower Shop had borrowed approximately 5 million yuan from the Mass Credit Cooperative, and owed more than 10 million yuan in external debts. The Mass Credit Cooperative has recovered 3 million yuan of the loan, with 2 million yuan still outstanding. All external debts also remain unpaid. Later, because the two shops suffered excessive losses due to speculation, the managers secretly fled. Furthermore, when various cotton batting workshops in the city provided 100,000 catties of cotton batting to a certain government agency, Ma Shenglong of the New Market added sand, soil, and seeds to make up the weight when delivering the cotton. Wang Zhenhua, the head of the Jiaoyao Street cotton batting group, Dai Zhenhai, the head of the East Market group, and the Yufeng Flower Shop bought rotten red cotton at low prices and mixed it in, while keeping the good white cotton. Nie Chengjun of the Gongxing Flower Shop stole white cotton and mixed in more than 20 catties of broken seeds. After the government discovered the above actions, it immediately attached importance to them. Regarding the illegal shops of Zhongxin and Xinsheng, the municipal government has conducted a thorough investigation to recover the losses and impose sanctions in accordance with the law. Regarding the illegal actions of Ma Shenglong and Gongxing Flower Shop, other cotton batting workshops have raised their opinions. The Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce, based on everyone's feedback, convened a general meeting of cotton batting workshops and flower shops in the city to criticize this speculative behavior, and ordered them to compensate for the losses. Everyone unanimously resolved to remove Wang Zhenhua and other group leaders from their positions, and formulated a covenant to ensure that such incidents would not happen again in the future.

Regarding this kind of illegal phenomenon in the privately owned industrial and commercial sector in Handan City, the Jinnan Daily published a short commentary criticizing these industrial and commercial owners for not implementing the industrial and commercial policies of the liberated areas, not honestly developing industry and commerce beneficial to the national economy to seek legitimate and appropriate profits, but instead engaging in speculation and attempting to become rich overnight like in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, even engaging in fraudulent and shameless behavior, continuing their old bad habits. The former is exemplified by Wang Yaoxian, manager of the Yifeng Thread Factory, and the latter by Sun Jinghai and Guo Yuncheng, managers of Zhongxin and Xinsheng. As for the actions of Ma Shenglong, Wang Zhenhua, and others in the cotton batting and flower shops, they are purely despicable behaviors of private merchants in the old society who were extremely selfish and self-interested, harming the public to benefit themselves, only knowing selfishness and disregarding the overall situation. The commentary believes that these phenomena are serious and cannot be ignored. For these speculators, it should be explained to them that: "What the People's Government allows and protects is only all industries and commerce that are beneficial to the national economy, and only its legitimate business operations. If there are any acts that undermine the national economy and violate laws and regulations, they will naturally not be allowed or protected, but should be prohibited and subject to appropriate legal sanctions." Finally, the commentary proposed that the Handan Municipal Committee and the Municipal Government should investigate and study the reasons for this serious phenomenon in the city's industrial and commercial sector, and appropriately resolve and handle it based on the actual situation and the principles of industrial and commercial policies; and under the propaganda and education of the policies, make the city's industrial and commercial sector eradicate all bad habits and embark on the right path.

    邯郸某些私商违反法令
    投机取巧受到制裁
    冀南日报著论予以批评
    【本报讯】冀南邯郸市某些私营工商业者，不从正当地发展业务中取得利润；竟骗取贷款，进行商业投机，或偷工掺假，取巧图利。结果投机者本钱赔光，取巧者皆被揭发，群众对此种投机取巧行为极为反对，政府正依法追究。该市怡丰线工厂是今年二月由东大街一百多个商人、店员和工人集股成立的，股金一百九十余万元。经理王耀先，不注意发展业务，反而一味进行商业投机。今年他贷了银行二千六百万元，不注意提高工业生产，而跑到石家庄贩卖洋纱大车作商业投机买卖，想从中发一笔横财，但结果赔了三百五十万元，除将全部家具和资金完全赔光外，还负下一百余万元的债务。众新花店（经理孙靖海）、新生油店（经理郭云城）两家是联号，众新资本三百万元，新生一百万元。因为资本都不多，除了修理门市房子外，已经没有多少活动资本。该二店经理就设法骗取贷款进行商业投机。众新花店前后曾向群众信用合作社信用贷款约五百万元，另外，东拉西借欠下外债不下一千多万。群众信用合作社已将贷款收回三百万元，还有二百万没有归还。一切外欠也都未归还。后来该二店因为投机失败亏累过巨，该经理等乃偷偷逃跑。又该市各弹花坊给某机关弹花十万斤，有新市场马升龙在交花时竟掺沙、土、籽等顶分量；焦窑街花坊组长王振华、东市场组长戴振海和豫丰花店，则低价买烂红花掺进去，将好白花扣下；公兴花店聂成钧偷去白花后，掺进破籽二十多斤。以上种种行为经政府发觉后，立即引起重视。对众新、新生二家不法商店，市政府已向各方清查，以便追回依法制裁。对马升龙、公兴花店等不法行为，其他花坊已纷纷提出意见，市工商局根据大家反映，曾召集该市花坊、花店全体会议，对这种投机取巧行为进行了批评，并令其赔偿。大家一致决议将王振华等组长罢免，并订出公约，大家监督，保证今后不再发生此类事情。
    对于邯市私营工商业中此种犯法现象，冀南日报曾发表短论，批评这些工商业主不执行解放区的工商业政策，不老老实实去发展有益于国民经济的工商业，以求合法的、适当的利润；而去投机取巧，企图象在蒋管区一样，一夜暴富，甚至进行拐骗等无耻行为，继续其旧有的恶习。前者如怡丰线工厂经理王耀先，后者如众新、新生经理孙靖海、郭云城。至于花坊花店之马升龙王振华等之所为纯系旧社会私商极端自私自利的卑劣行为，坑公家以自肥，只知自私，不顾大体。该短论认为这些现象是严重的，不容我们忽视。对于这些投机取巧者应向他们说明：“人民政府所允许和保护的，只是一切有益于国民经济的工商业，只是其合法的营业。如果其中有破坏国民经济，违反法令的行为，自然不在被允许与保护之列，而应受到禁止与法律上适当的制裁。”最后该短论又提出邯市市委会、市政府应对该市工商业发生这种严重现象的原因加以调查研究，根据实际情况和工商业政策的原则适当加以解决和处理；并在政策的宣传教育下，使该市的工商业革除一切恶习，走上正规。
