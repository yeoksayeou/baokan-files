　　Several Problems in Old Opera Work
    Meng Geng
    In the North China region, I saw some old opera troupes directly led by the government and the military, which actually "aimed at making profits and prospering the market." The responsible leading organs adhered to the principle of "not losing money, having shows to watch." They did not regard the transformation of old opera as a major political task of educating millions of people. Therefore, in the past few years, the work of transforming old opera and reforming old performers has been done very poorly.
    In the year since the liberation of Shijiazhuang, no fewer than six or seven old opera troupes led by the government and the military have come and gone. In terms of new plays, in addition to the "Three Attacks on Zhu Village," "Forced to Join Liangshan," and "The River God Takes a Wife" that have been performed for many years, there were very few others. Some troupes didn't even have any new creations (not even these few plays). In the selection of old opera programs, there was no careful selection at all, sometimes even less careful than private opera troupes. For example, the Liberation Opera Troupe led by the Taihang Military Region even performed "The Civet Cat for Crown Prince" (although slightly modified, it was very rough), as well as the most reactionary "Three Steals of the Nine Dragon Cups" praising the traitor Huang Tianba. Old performers reflected: "Why do public troupes still perform these plays, while our private troupes are not allowed to perform them?" Also, all the public troupes that came were wearing military uniforms or uniforms, but they were not very careful in their actions and styles, eating and drinking with old performers, and forming a united front without principle, casually complaining and spreading gossip to the newly liberated performers, giving the performers a very bad impression: "Why do public troupes still have these problems? It's even more lively than the old opera troupes!" In terms of business transformation, they could not influence and promote the old performers; in terms of ideological style, they also left a bad impression.
    As far as I know, most of these public troupes were old opera troupes in the past. After liberation, the public sent a few cadres. During the busy farming season, they concentrated on performing in the cities, and during the slack farming season, they went to temple fairs and sang on high platforms. Cadres focused on dealing with play distribution, personnel issues, and writing introductions. The troupes became purely commercial in nature with the localities, and the troupes and performers also became a buying and selling relationship. Performers had no opportunity to improve, scripts had no time to be created, and if they wanted to make money, they still used the methods of the old troupe owners: "Invite good performers and perform old plays." Therefore, the bad habit of secretly "inviting performers" was created. Some public troupes did not analyze and understand the old performers at all, only saw the technology, could attract audiences and make money, then unscrupulously, regardless of the impact, regardless of the masses' reflections, this is a very bad phenomenon, greatly affecting the work of transforming old opera. Giving the masses such a bad impression, and these public troupes turned a blind eye, the heads of the troupes have not yet checked well.
    Also, local governments, in order to develop the market, establish temple fairs, either contract operas or sell operas, and invite old opera troupes at high prices. The performance programs are not reviewed at all, and some places even call for the performance of bad plays for the sake of making money or because of personal preferences. For example, a certain opera troupe was invited to Old City, Shulu County, and performed "Si Lang Visits His Mother," "The Black Pot," "The Cave of Spider Spirits," "Hong Niang," etc., which created a very bad impression among the masses. The troupe dared not perform, and the cadres even said nothing. Some places write plays, and the price is amazing, waiting to be picked up and delivered, 7 million yuan (border currency) per day, some old opera troupes can earn more than 100 million in ten days or so. "We don't earn as much as them, they can earn back the price of the play in a day or two." This is the reflection of some old performers. They described the scene of selling tickets, the audience was packed, watching the play during the day, then buying tickets for the evening, a play can sell thousands of seats, creating the argument that old performers are unwilling to transform their business and are willing to go to local areas to perform: "Make more money, perform freely, and not be restricted." Inviting a play costs so much money, and so many peasant audiences watch the play, performing those toxic bad plays, "spending money to exchange for poison," deceiving the working people, being so irresponsible to the people, it is really heartbreaking, and it needs to be corrected urgently. To this day, the trend of writing old plays is even more prevalent, and almost every day people come to Shijiazhuang to write plays. Local governments have not paid enough attention to this problem, which seriously hinders the work of transforming old opera.
    Based on the above situation, I would like to raise a few questions for the reference of comrades engaged in old opera work.
    1.  With the gradual liberation of major cities, we do not have so many cadres to send to old opera troupes to take over. Therefore, it is hoped that public troupes will quickly strengthen internal learning, change the profit-making policy to the policy of improving the thinking of performers and transforming old opera to educate the broad masses. Adapt old operas, create a large number of new historical dramas, and influence and promote the progress of old performers from practical actions, styles, and business transformation, and do our best to help private opera troupes, improve their thinking, transform old opera, and serve the people. Strictly prevent eating and drinking with old performers, being harmonious, forming a united front without principle, and surrendering to old techniques and old habits without criticism. This will not only fail to unite them and improve their thinking, so that they can make rapid progress, but some people may even scold you behind your back as "old laymen (i.e., amateurs) are incompetent!"
    2.  We should strengthen our creative ability, and we should "attract audiences" with new plays, popular with the masses, and with educational significance. We should oppose the purely technical viewpoint, the viewpoint of selling money by relying on "good performers," and the practice of treating old performers as commodities in a buying and selling relationship. If a troupe arranges a new play, and the roles are not enough, and it is necessary to invite performers, it must be introduced by the responsible local authority, and the head of the private troupe must agree. Severely criticize the past anarchic and undisciplined practices. This has also affected the lives and business transformation of old performers.
    3.  In addition to a unified and rapid review of programs, local governments should strictly review the performance of old opera programs based on the spirit of the People's Daily's editorial on "carrying out old opera reform work in a planned and step-by-step manner." Before inviting old opera troupes, local governments should first review whether there are "new plays" and whether there is educational significance after going there, and use this as a standard for writing plays, signing contracts, and setting prices. When ordering plays, we should be truly responsible to the people, first think of serving the people, not deceiving and poisoning the people, and order "new plays" with educational significance. In this way, we can promote the recognition of old opera troupes and performers from all aspects that "old opera must be reformed." Change their backward view that "the liberated area is very large, if they don't let us perform here, we are still welcome there," and quickly eliminate the phenomenon that is nominally a public troupe but is actually a tool of feudalist propaganda.
    4.  The rigid doctrinaire method of "taking our scripts and ordering the performers to rehearse them" without combining with reality, "plays" may be rehearsed a few, but the performers think that it is an "order," not "rehearsing a play," because they do not have a correct understanding of "why old opera should be reformed" in their minds. Practical experience has proven that "to reform old opera, we must first improve the ideological consciousness of the performers," and call on them to recognize the necessity and standards of reforming old opera from the ideological level, and let them change it themselves and rehearse it themselves, and the effect will be great.
    5.  We have been in the countryside for a long time, and we have had considerable achievements and experience in transforming rural performers. However, large and medium-sized cities are places where old performers are concentrated. The living habits and ideological styles of these urban performers are very different from those of rural performers. If we take "training performers, sending cadres to lead specifically, reorganizing opera troupes into public troupes, or still private organizations internally reorganized into revolutionary organizations," etc., these experiences will not only fail to improve the thinking of old performers and transform their business; on the contrary, they will be stuck, collapsing if they leave this or that, grasping here and there and unable to manage, and getting stuck in the circle of affairs and unable to pull out their feet. According to recent statistics in Shijiazhuang, there are more than 400 old performers who are active in the market, and there will be more old performers in cities larger than Shijiazhuang. How to transform old performers and lead them to progress is an arduous task. It is hoped that public troupes and responsible authorities will quickly collect experience in this area and draw correct conclusions in order to thoroughly correct the shortcomings in theatrical work.

　　旧剧工作中的几个问题
    梦庚
    在华北区，我看到有些政府和部队直接领导的旧剧团体，竟“以营利为目的，繁荣市面为宗旨。”负责领导的机关，则以“不赔钱，有戏看”为原则。没有把改造旧剧看成教育千百万群众的重大政治任务，所以在已往的数年里，对改造旧剧、改造旧艺人工作，都作的很差。
    石家庄解放一年里，政府和部队领导的旧剧团来往不下六七个，在新戏的演出上，除多年的“三打祝家庄”、“逼上梁山”、“河伯娶妇”等剧外，则寥寥无几，甚至有的剧团看不到新的创作（连这几戏也没有）。在演出旧剧节目上，则毫不加选择，有时甚至还不如私人戏班慎重。如太行军区领导的解放剧团，竟然演出了“狸猫换太子”（虽然稍改，但很粗糙），还有最反动的歌颂叛徒黄天霸“三盗九龙杯”一类的戏，旧艺人反映：“为什么公家剧团还演这些戏，我们私人班倒不许演呢？”还有，所有来过的公家剧团，都是穿着军装或制服，可是在部分人的行动作风上很不注意，跟旧艺人吃吃喝喝，无原则的打成一片，向刚解放的艺人随意发牢骚、小广播，给艺人很坏的印象：“为什么公家剧团还有这些问题呢？比旧戏班还热闹！”在业务改造上，不能影响推动旧艺人；在思想作风上，还留下坏的印象。
    据我所知，这些公家剧团，大部分是过去的旧戏班，解放后公家派上几个干部，农忙时集中城市里出演，农闲时赶庙会、唱高台。干部以处理戏分、人事问题、写台口成了中心工作。剧团与地方上变为纯商业性质，剧团与艺人也成了买卖关系，艺人没有机会提高，剧本没有时间创作，要想赚钱仍用过去成班老板的方法：“邀好角儿，演旧戏。”因此造成偷偷“邀角”之恶劣风气。有些公家剧团对旧艺人毫不加分析了解，只看到技术，能叫座赚钱，则不择手段，不顾及影响，不听群众反映，这是极不良的现象，大大影响了旧剧改造的工作。给群众这样恶劣的影响，而这些公家剧团则熟视无睹，剧团负责人尚未很好的去检查。
    还有各地方政府为发展市面，建立庙会，或包戏或卖戏，用大价钱邀请旧剧团。演出节目上毫不加审查，甚至有些地方为着赚钱，或因个人爱好，什么坏戏都叫演出。如某剧社被束鹿县旧城邀去，曾演出“四郎探母”、“乌盆计”、“盘丝洞”、“红娘”等等，在群众中造成很坏的印象。剧团不敢演，干部们还说二话。有的地方写戏，价钱惊人，等接等送，每天七百万元（边钞），有的旧剧团下去十几天，即可赚到一万万多。“我们还不如人家赚钱多，他们一两天即可把戏价赚回来。”这是一些旧艺人的反映。他们述说卖票的情景，场场水泄不通的观众，看了白天的戏，接着买晚上的票，一场戏可以卖到数千座位，造成旧艺人不愿改造业务，愿到地方上去演戏：“赚钱多，演戏自由，不受限制”的论调。邀请一台戏，花费这么多钱，有这么多农民观众看戏，演出那些有毒素的坏戏，“花钱换毒”，欺骗劳苦大众，对人民如此不负责任，实堪痛心，亟待改正。迄今写旧戏之风气更盛，差不多每天都有到石家庄来写戏的，各地方政府尚未足够注意此问题，严重的妨碍了改造旧剧工作。
    根据以上情况，谨提几个问题，供从事旧剧工作同志的参考。
    一、大城市逐渐解放，我们没有那么多干部派到旧戏班去接收，故希公家剧团迅速加强内部学习，变营利方针为提高艺人思想，改造旧剧以教育广大群众的方针。改编旧剧，大量创作新历史剧，从实际行动、作风与业务改造上，影响推动旧艺人进步，尽力帮助私人戏班，提高他们思想，改造旧剧，为人民服务。严防与旧艺人吃吃喝喝，一团和气，无原则的打成一片，向旧技术、旧习惯不加批判的甘拜下风去投降，这不但团结不住他们，提高不了他们的思想，使他们迅速进步，有些人甚至在背后还骂你“老斗（即外行）无能！”
    二、应该加强我们的创作能力，应以新戏、有群众爱看及有教育意义来“叫座”，反对纯技术观点，凭“好角”卖钱的观点，把旧艺人当成商品买卖关系的作法。如剧团排新戏，角色不够，须要邀角时，必须遵守经该地方负责机关介绍，私人戏班负责人同意。严肃批评已往的无政府无纪律乱来一起的作风，这样也影响了旧艺人的生活与业务改造。
    三、除统一的迅速审查节目外，各地方政府应该根据人民日报“有计划有步骤地进行旧剧改革工作”专论的精神，严格审查旧剧节目之演出。各地方邀请旧剧团前，应先审核是否有“新戏”，是否去后有教育意义，当成写戏订合同、定价钱的标准。点戏时，应该切实向人民负责，首先想到为人民服务，不欺骗毒害人民，点有教育意义的“新戏”，这样从各方面促成旧剧团体艺人“旧剧必须加以改革”的认识。改变他们总认为“解放区大的很，这里不叫演那里还欢迎”的落后观点，迅速消灭名义上是公家剧团，实际上是封建主义的宣传工具的现象。
    四、“把我们的剧本，命令艺人去排”这种不与实际相结合的生硬教条主义方法，“戏”可能排几个，但艺人们认为那是“命令”，不是“排戏”，因为他们思想上并没有感到“旧剧为什么要改”的正确认识。从实际证明：“改革旧戏，必须先提高艺人思想觉悟”，叫他们从思想上认识改革旧剧的必要性与标准，自己去改，自己去排，效果很大。
    五、我们长期处在乡村里，已往对改造乡村艺人工作是有相当成绩与经验的，但中大城市是旧艺人集中的地方，这些城市艺人的生活习惯，思想作风，与乡村艺人有很大的不同。如拿“艺人集训，派干部具体领导，把戏班改编成公家剧团，或仍是私人组织内部改成革命团体的组织机构等等”这些经验来作，不但不能提高了旧艺人思想，改造业务；反而沾住了，离开这个那个垮，东抓西抓管不了，陷到事务圈子里拔不出脚来。据石家庄最近统计，经常活动在市上的旧艺人达四百余人之多，比石家庄更大的城市旧艺人将更多，如何改造旧艺人，带领他们进步，这是一项繁重的工作，希望各公家剧团，负责机关迅速搜集这方面的经验，作出正确的结论，以彻底改正戏剧工作中所存在的缺点。
