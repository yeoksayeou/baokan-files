　　Xiyang Fourth District Inspects Winter Production
    Strengthens Leadership to Overcome Drift
    [Taihang News] Xiyang Office reports: The First and Fourth Districts of the county recently held meetings to inspect and correct the drifting phenomenon in winter production. The Congwo base point of the Fourth District held a joint meeting of village cadres on the 28th of last month to inspect winter production. The meeting lasted a long time, but no one could present any information. The villages had not paid attention to leading winter production. Most villages only established production committees, and the cadres just mentioned it at the mass meeting. Some didn't even hold a meeting, let alone organize leadership. However, the masses were eager to engage in production, spontaneously carrying out various kinds of production. For example, in Congwo, six young people organized a fox hunting team, killing sixteen foxes in one month. There were also many who were doing small peddling, but these productions lacked planning and leadership.
    When examining the leadership's thinking, the branch secretary of Lijia Village said: "Land reform work has a time limit, but production work has no time limit..." The village head of Congwo Village said: "My thinking is only about finishing land reform, and I didn't think about leading production!" The village head of Shuimotou Village said: "After the production committee members returned from the district meeting, they wanted to discuss it, and I said: Just keep it in your stomach for now, and we'll talk about it after the land reform is finished." After self-criticism, everyone realized that production had suffered due to the relaxation of leadership. It was decided to strengthen production leadership, coordinate well with the completion of land reform, and unite leadership and division of labor to ensure production is done well. The 16 villages of the Zhangcheng base point in the First District inspected the phenomenon of solely focusing on completing land reform and neglecting production leadership. The main cadres in most villages did not lead production or take into account the production time of the masses. For example, in Nan Zhangcheng, it was difficult to gather people for meetings during the day, so administrative orders were used, and the morale of the masses was not high, and the land reform could not be done well. After self-criticism, it was clarified that the completion of land reform and production can be carried out in a crisscrossing and parallel manner, and the leadership should reasonably organize forces, study production methods, and meet the production requirements of the masses.

### 昔阳四区检查冬季生产　加强领导克服自流

　　昔阳四区检查冬季生产
    加强领导克服自流
    【太行讯】昔阳办公室报导：该县一、四区最近开会，检查纠正冬季生产的自流现象。四区葱窝基点于上月二十八日召开各村干部联席会，检查冬季生产，会开了好久，大家一点材料也谈不出来，各村都没注意领导冬季生产，大部村只是建立了生产委员会，干部在群众会上说了一下就算了，有的甚至连会也没开，更谈不到什么组织领导。群众方面却是迫切要求生产，自发的进行各式各样的生产。如葱窝有六个青年组织了打狐组，一月打了十六个狐。还有不少作担挑小买卖的，这些生产都很缺乏计划和领导。
    检查到领导思想，李家村支书说：“土改工作有期限，生产工作没期限……”葱窝村长说：“我思想上只有个结束土改，就没想到还要领导生产哩！”水磨头村长说：“生产委员在区开会回来让研究，我说：你且在肚里装着吧，等结束了土改再说”。经过检讨，一致认识由于放松了领导，使生产受了损失。决定要加强生产领导，和结束土改配合好，统一领导分工去干，一定要把生产搞好。一区掌城基点十六个村检查单纯作结束土改放松生产领导的现象，多数村主要干部不领导生产，也不照顾群众生产时间，如南掌城白天开会召集不到人，就用行政命令办法，群众情绪不高，结束土改也做不好。经检讨后，明确结束土改与生产可以交叉平行开展，领导上要合理组织力量，研究生产门路，满足群众生产要求。
