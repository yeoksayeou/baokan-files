　　Annihilation of the Huang Wei Corps
　　Our Valiant Artillery Displayed Immense Power
　　　　　　(I) The Demise of the Enemy's 14th Corps
　　After being surrounded by our forces in the small area around Shuangduiji on the evening of November 29th, the Huang Wei Corps' 14th Corps huddled in the three small villages of Yangweizi, Liweizi, and Shenzhuang, struggling in its death throes. After careful preparation, our army began shelling Liweizi village, occupied by the 10th Division of the enemy corps, at 4:00 PM on the 6th. Instantly, thick smoke filled the sky, and the enemy's bodies and weapons were hurled dozens of feet into the air. At 5:00 PM, our army launched an assault, breaking through the front line in five minutes, and by 10:00 PM, the entire village was occupied, and the defending enemy's 10th Division command post and its subordinate 29th and 30th Regiments were wiped out. The division commander, Zhang Guobin, was killed in action. At 5:00 AM on the 8th, we used even more intense artillery fire to bombard Shenzhuang, the location of the enemy's 85th Division. Within two minutes, our army stormed into the village in five routes. In just fifteen minutes, the battle was completely resolved, creating an exemplary victory model of swiftly defeating the enemy, annihilating the entire enemy 85th Division command post and its 253rd and 254th Regiments. The acting division commander, Pan Qi, was also captured alive. On the night of the 10th, our army took advantage of the victory and continued to attack Yangweizi, guarded by the enemy corps headquarters, capturing seven groups of bunkers north and east of the village, stripping away the outer shell of the enemy bandits, and annihilating the 2nd Battalion of its 255th Regiment. At 10:00 AM on the 11th, the enemy pieced together remnants and launched a counterattack under the cover of tanks, attempting a final desperate struggle, but their lower-ranking officers and soldiers chose their own paths to survival—at noon that day, the heavy machine gun company of the enemy's 255th Regiment in the north of the village, disregarding the artillery fire of the "督战队" (supervisory units meant to prevent desertion), crawled to our army's positions to surrender. That evening, our army's iron pincers closed in, wiping out the enemy corps headquarters and the remnants of the 255th Regiment, the 28th Regiment, and the 10th and 85th Divisions in Yangweizi. Corps Chief of Staff Liang Dai, Deputy Chief of Staff Zhan Bitao, 253rd Regiment Commander Liu Jibin, 254th Regiment Commander He Yulin, 255th Regiment Commander Li Jianmin, and Deputy Regiment Commander Zhang Wenbin were all captured alive. Corps Commander Xiong Shouchun was killed in action by the Liberation Army's fierce artillery fire. By this point, the enemy's 14th Corps was completely annihilated.
　　　　　　(II) "Valiant Artillery"
　　During the attack on Liweizi, enemy aircraft dropped leaflets from the sky with the message: "Nationalist Army comrades, hold fast and await reinforcements! We have strong '梅花形' (plum blossom-shaped) and '鱼鳞形' (fish scale-shaped) fortifications that are as solid as gold." However, when our offensive artillery fire began, the myth of the enemy's confidently defended "strong fortifications" was shattered by our iron hammers. At 4:00 PM on the 6th, after half an hour of trial shots by our various artillery pieces, the formal bombardment began. Howitzers, field guns, mountain guns, anti-tank guns, and mortars poured dozens of shells at a time onto the enemy's fortifications. The sound of the artillery shook the earth. Within minutes, the entire enemy stronghold was shrouded in thick smoke, and piles of mud, door panels, and timber were blown into the sky. A howitzer shell accurately landed on the central large bunker, blowing it up, and several enemy corpses and their machine guns were thrown thirty to fifty feet into the air. Soldiers lying in wait on the front line shouted, "Well done! One more shot..." Then came another shot, and another fortification was destroyed, and the enemy was completely stunned. At that moment, the assault team fired a row of red signal flares, and the troops charged, raining bombs and hand cannons on the enemy. The artillery then shifted its targets to the rear, cooperating with the assault team to eliminate the enemy. The last remaining enemies, resisting stubbornly with flamethrowers and handheld weapons under the supervision of the "督战队," were quickly captured by our vanguard assault troops who had surrounded them from the east, northeast, and northwest. The cotton clothes of many prisoners were torn to shreds by shrapnel, and cotton wadding fluttered from their bodies. Some prisoners were dug out from the collapsed fortifications, covered in dirt. When they talked about the Liberation Army's fierce artillery fire, they all paled in comparison. Qi Yutang, the deputy battalion commander of the 30th Regiment of the 10th Division, who was pulled out of a pile of dead bodies, said while straightening his shredded overcoat, "It was a terrible beating! At least half of our 29th and 30th Regiments were killed or wounded by your artillery fire." Then he added, "My orderly, Xu Zhengze, and I were standing outside the fortifications when a shell landed nearby, blowing him to smithereens."
　　　　　　(III) Battle for Dawangzhuang
　　The battle for Dawangzhuang, southwest of Shuangduiji in Yishili, on December 10th, was the fiercest battle of the past ten days on the Su-Meng battlefield. On the night of the 9th, a unit of our People's Liberation Army stormed Dawangzhuang, completely annihilating the defending 33rd Regiment of the 118th Division of the Jiang bandits, exposing Shuangduiji and its surrounding villages, the location of the enemy Huang Wei Corps headquarters, to our artillery fire. In order to consolidate the flank of Shuangduiji, the enemy reorganized the remnants of the 18th Corps the next day and, under the cover of aircraft and heavy artillery, made a desperate struggle, using broadswords, aircraft strafing, and tank assaults to force its troops into a group charge, fully counterattacking Dawangzhuang. The enemy also used five tanks to patrol outside Miaoqi Village, acting as mobile fortresses, trying to block traffic and cut off our follow-up troops. The People's Liberation Army in the village engaged the enemy in a house-to-house battle, repeatedly charging and fighting fiercely all day long, until evening when the enemy suffered thousands of casualties, with piles of corpses like mountains, before fleeing in disarray. According to Company Commander Zhao, who fought in the village, Dawangzhuang became a sea of fire that day. The trenches throughout the village were as dense as a spider web. As soon as an enemy showed his head, he would be hit by a bullet from our marksmen, and his skull and helmet would fly into the sky together. Rifles were rarely used, the main weapons were bayonets and bombs, and that company alone threw about three thousand bombs.

　　歼灭黄维兵团战斗
    我神勇炮兵威力无比
            （一）敌十四军的覆没
    上月二十九日晚黄维兵团被我包围在双堆集周围狭小地区以后，该兵团所属的十四军挤在杨围子、李围子、沈庄三个小村中作垂死挣扎。我军经过周密准备后，于六日下午四时起，即向该军第十师盘踞的李围子村进行炮轰，一时浓烟腾空，敌人的尸体和武器被抛到几丈高的天空。五时我军乃发起冲锋，五分钟突破前沿，至晚十时占领全村，肃清守敌十师指挥所及所辖二十九团、三十团。师长张国斌被击毙。八日五时，我以更猛烈的炮火向敌八十五师所在地沈庄轰击，两分钟内，我军分五路冲进村内，仅十五分钟，全部解决战斗，创造了迅速克敌致胜的模范战例，全歼敌八十五师指挥所及其二五三、二五四两个团，敌代师长潘琦亦被活捉。十日晚，我军乘胜继续向敌军部据守的杨围子进击，攻占村北、村东七个碉堡群，剥掉敌匪的外壳，并歼其二五五团的第二营。十一日十时，敌人拼凑残部在坦克掩护下反扑，妄想作最后的挣扎，但其下级官兵却纷起自择生路——当日中午村北敌二五五团重机枪连不顾“督战队”的炮火，匍匐着爬到我军阵地来投降。当晚我军的铁钳合击，把杨围子敌军部及二五五团、二十八团及第十、八十五两个师的残部一网打尽。军参谋长梁岱，副参谋长詹璧陶，二五三团团长刘继斌，二五四团团长何玉林，二五五团团长李剑民，副团长张文斌皆被生擒。军长熊绶春在战斗中被解放军的猛烈炮火击毙。至此，敌十四军全军覆没。
    　　　　（二）“神勇的炮兵”
    在攻击李围子时，敌机从天空投下了这样的传单：“国军同志们：固守待援吧！我们有坚强的梅花形和鱼鳞形工事固若金汤”。可是当我们进攻的炮火开始后，敌人自信地据守着的“坚强工事”的神话，被我铁锤打得粉碎。六日下午四时，我军各种炮火试射半小时后，正式开始轰击，榴弹炮，野炮，山炮，战防炮，曲射炮，把炮弹几十个一排地倾泻在敌人的工事上，炮声震撼大地。几分钟后，整个敌人的据点便被蒙罩在一片浓烟里，一堆堆的泥块、门板、木料被炸到天空去。一颗榴弹炮弹准确地落在中间大碉上，大碉被炸飞了，几个敌人的尸体和他们的机关枪，一齐被抛上三五丈高的天空中。伏在前沿准备出击的战士大声喊：“打得好呀！再来一炮……”接着又是一炮，又一工事被炸去了，敌人完全被震昏了。正在这时，突击队发出了一排红信号弹，部队出击了，雨点般的炸弹和手炮投向敌人，炮兵随即把目标移向了纵深，配合突击队解决敌人。最后一部分在“督战队”监视下，用喷火器和手提式顽抗着的敌人，也很快就被从东、东北、西北三方包围上来的我军先头突击部队俘掳了。许多俘虏的棉衣被弹片撕烂，棉花布片在身上飘舞着，有些俘虏则从炸塌的工事中被刨出来的，全身是土。他们一谈起解放军猛烈的炮火，莫不相顾失色。从死人堆里拉出来的十师三十团二营营副齐玉堂，他一面整理着被撕成碎片的大衣，一面说：“打得好惨！我们二十九团、三十团至少有一半死伤在你们的炮火下”。随后他又说：“我和传令兵徐正则一起站出工事，一颗炮弹落在附近，把他炸得无影无踪。”
    　　　　（三）大王庄争夺战
    十二月十日双堆集西南一市里之大王庄争夺战，为宿蒙战场十天以来最激烈之战斗。九日夜，我人民解放军一部强攻大王庄，全歼守敌蒋匪十八军一一八师三十三团，使敌黄维兵团司令部所在地之双堆集及其附近村庄全部暴露于我军炮火之下。敌为巩固双堆集之侧背，次日乃重整十八军残部在飞机重炮掩护下，作垂死之挣扎，并用大刀砍杀、飞机扫射、坦克冲撞，逼迫其部队作集团冲锋，全力反扑大王庄。敌又以坦克五辆巡梭庙棋村外，充作活动堡垒，竭力封锁交通，切断我后续部队。在村内的人民解放军与敌展开逐屋争夺战，反复冲杀，苦斗竟日，直至傍晚敌伤亡数千，尸堆如山，乃狼狈回窜。据在村内作战之赵连长称：是日大王庄成为一片火海，全村战壕纵横密如蛛网，敌人只要一露头，就会碰到我们特等射手的子弹，他的头盖骨和钢盔也就一齐飞向天空。步枪很少使用，主要武器是刺刀和炸弹，仅该连所投炸弹共计在三千颗左右。
