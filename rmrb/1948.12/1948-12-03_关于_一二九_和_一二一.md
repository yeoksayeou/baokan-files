　　Regarding "December 9th" and "December 1st"
    Question: The All-China Youth Federation in the Liberated Areas issued a circular on November 5th to commemorate "December 9th" and "December 1st." How did the two anniversaries, "December 9th" and "December 1st," originate?
    Answer:　"December 9th" and "December 1st" are two anniversaries of the Chinese student movement. The "December 9th" Movement was launched on December 9, 1935, before the War of Resistance Against Japan. It took place in Beiping (Beijing), and its central slogans were opposing national betrayal, opposing civil war, demanding national unity to resist Japan, and demanding democracy. The "December 1st" Massacre occurred on December 1, 1945, after the end of the War of Resistance Against Japan. It took place in Kunming, and its central slogans were opposing a new civil war, demanding the establishment of a democratic coalition government, and demanding the withdrawal of American troops from China.
    On the eve of the "December 9th" Movement in 1935, China was in a serious crisis of intensified Japanese imperialist aggression and the Kuomintang's continued betrayal and civil war. In November 1935, the Kuomintang government ordered the "suppression of anti-Japanese activities." In May, He Yingqin signed the He-Umezu Agreement with the commander of the Japanese "Garrison Army" in North China, withdrawing the Kuomintang's direct line of troops and military police from North China. In June, the Kuomintang government ordered "good neighborliness." In November, the puppet anti-communist autonomous government of eastern Hebei was established under Japanese control. Based on Japan's further demands for the so-called special status of North China, the Kuomintang government decided to establish the "Hebei-Chahar Political Council" in Beiping on December 16th. At this time, the main force of the Chinese revolution—the Red Army—was detouring to the northwest in order to continue advancing to the anti-Japanese front. After the Chinese Communist Party issued a declaration on August 1st calling for unity among all parties, factions, sectors, and armies across the country to resist Japan, it was actively striving for the realization of the anti-Japanese national united front and the People's Democratic Republic. However, the Kuomintang reactionaries ignored the patriotic proposals of the Chinese Communist Party and continued to encircle and suppress the Red Army in the northwest. In the Kuomintang-controlled areas, although the people's revolutionary movement suffered great losses and difficulties under the Kuomintang's long-term brutal suppression, the people's demands for resisting Japan and opposing civil war continued to grow and gradually spread to all patriotic strata. The students of Beiping, being at the forefront of Japanese aggression and in a place where the Kuomintang's ruling power was relatively weak, and having certain political and organizational conditions under the influence of the Chinese Communist Party, became the vanguard of the people in the Kuomintang-controlled areas in responding to the Chinese Communist Party's anti-Japanese democratic propositions. More than 20,000 students in Beiping broke through the suppression of the Kuomintang military police and their broadswords, water cannons, wooden sticks, and whips, and held two large-scale demonstrations. Although more than a hundred students were injured and arrested, not only were the students in Beiping not intimidated, but their movement quickly spread to students in Tianjin, Shanghai, Nanjing, Hangzhou, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Jinan, Kaifeng, Taiyuan, and other places, and quickly spread to workers, clerks, freelancers, and other patriotic elements in the cities. The students successively established organizations such as the Beiping Student Union, the All-China Student Federation, and the National Liberation Vanguard Team, while people from other strata established national salvation associations and national salvation joint associations. The patriotic democratic movement of the people in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, which began with "December 9th," continued to develop until the outbreak of the War of Resistance Against Japan in July 1937, becoming one of the important forces promoting the outbreak of the War of Resistance Against Japan.
    The War of Resistance Against Japan ended with Japan's surrender in August 1945. The Chinese Communist Party led the people of the whole country in demanding that, after the end of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the crisis of civil war should be stopped, the Kuomintang's one-party dictatorship should be abolished, and a democratic coalition government should be established in order to build an independent, peaceful, and democratic New China. Chairman Mao Zedong, the leader of the Chinese Communist Party, personally went to Chongqing, where the Kuomintang government was located, at the end of August to hold peace talks with Chiang Kai-shek. The result was the summary of the talks between the two parties, the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, announced on October 10, which stipulated that both sides agreed to "resolutely avoid civil war." However, the Kuomintang reactionaries and their American masters were actually attempting to seize the fruits of the people's struggle in the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan, restore China to the old dark rule, and have the United States replace Japan in ruling China. They then tore up the Double Tenth Agreement and launched a large-scale civil war to attack the People's Liberation Army. By the beginning of November, the Kuomintang government had used a total of one million troops in the counter-revolutionary civil war, many of which were transported to the front lines of the civil war by the American naval and air forces under the pretext of assisting in "accepting surrender." The Kuomintang reactionaries' and American reactionaries' sinister counter-revolutionary plan was not only resolutely resisted by the People's Liberation Army and the people in the liberated areas, but also resolutely opposed by the people in the Kuomintang-controlled areas. The students of various schools in Kunming (mainly schools that had moved from Beiping, Tianjin, and other places during the War of Resistance Against Japan) were active elements in opposing the counter-revolutionary civil war and opposing the US government's assistance to the Kuomintang in carrying out the counter-revolutionary civil war. The Kuomintang reactionaries' direct line of troops had by this time overthrown Long Yun's rule in Kunming with American military aid, and the student movement in Kunming was subjected to severe oppression. On November 25th, the Kuomintang military police opened fire to disrupt a forum held by Kunming students against the civil war. On the 26th, 30,000 students in Kunming announced a general strike. Disregarding the Kuomintang's persecution, they held street propaganda, demanding an end to the civil war, the implementation of democracy, the establishment of a democratic coalition government, and demanding the withdrawal of American troops from China. On December 1st, the Kuomintang garrison troops under Qiu Qingquan and the Kuomintang secret service agencies jointly attacked Southwest Associated University, Sino-French University, and the affiliated high school of Southwest Associated University in Kunming, severely beating students and teachers, and throwing grenades at student gatherings, bombing and killing Pan Yan and Li Lulian, students of Southwest Associated University, Zhang Huachang, a student of the Advanced Industrial School, and Yu Zai, a teacher at Nanjing Middle School. Contrary to the reactionaries' intentions, the "December 1st" Massacre did not shrink the national anti-civil war movement but expanded it. As a result of the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people continuing to fight resolutely for peace, the Political Consultative Conference was convened and a ceasefire order was issued in January 1946. However, the Kuomintang reactionaries, with the assistance of the American reactionaries, still tore up the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference and the ceasefire order and re-launched a nationwide counter-revolutionary civil war on a large scale. This made the people and youth across the country who opposed civil war and strove for peace gain a fundamental understanding that in order to eliminate any civil war and achieve true peace, there was only one path: the people of the whole country uniting together to resolutely, thoroughly, cleanly, and completely eliminate the Kuomintang's reactionary troops, overthrow the Kuomintang's reactionary rule, drive the aggressive forces of American imperialism out of China, and establish a unified, democratic People's Republic. There is no other path besides this.
    The "December 9th" Movement pursued two goals: resistance to Japan and democracy. The War of Resistance Against Japan was realized two years after "December 9th," and the Japanese invaders were defeated in eight years. This achieved a great victory, opening up a broad road and real possibilities for the cause of Chinese people's liberation. However, the demand for democracy was not realized in the "December 9th" Movement, nor was it realized in most of China during the War of Resistance. Therefore, in the "December 1st" period, it remained a central slogan. During the "December 1st" period, the people and youth demanded peace, demanded democracy, and demanded that American troops withdraw from China. These demands, with the rapid development of the Chinese People's Liberation War, are now increasingly approaching final victory.

### 关于“一二九”和“一二一”

　　关于“一二九”和“一二一”
    问：中国解放区青年联合会于十一月五日发出纪念“一二九”，“一二一”的通告。“一二九”和“一二一”两个纪念日是怎样产生的？
    答：　“一二九”和“一二一”是中国学生运动的两个纪念日。“一二九”运动发起于抗日战争以前的一九三五年十二月九日，地方是在北平，中心口号是反对卖国，反对内战，要求全国一致抗日，要求民主。“一二一”惨案发生于抗日战争结束后的一九四五年十二月一日，地方是在昆明，中心口号是反对新的内战，要求成立民主联合政府，要求美军撤出中国。
    在一九三五年“一二九”运动的前夜，中国正处在日本帝国主义加紧侵略和国民党继续卖国内战的严重危机中。一九三五年十一月，国民党政府下令“取缔排日”。五月，何应钦与华北日本“驻屯军”司令梅津签订何梅协定，撤退国民党嫡系在华北的军队和宪兵。六月，国民党政府下令睦邻。十一月，冀东成立日本傀儡防共自治政府。根据日本对于所谓华化特殊化的进一步的要求，国民党政府决定在十二月十六日在北平成立“冀察政务委员会”。这时中国革命的主力——红军正在绕道到西北来以便继续前进到抗日前线。中国共产党在八月一日发出了要求全国各党各派各界各军团结一致抗日的宣言以后，正在积极为抗日民族统一战线和人民民主共和国的实现而奋斗。但是国民党反动派不理会中国共产党的爱国主张，继续在西北围剿红军。在国民党统治区，人民革命运动在国民党长期的惨酷摧残下，虽然遭遇了极大的损失和困难，但是人民的抗日要求和反内战的要求却不断增长，并逐渐普及于一切爱国阶层。北平的学生，由于处在日本侵略的最前线，处在国民党统治力量比较薄弱的地方，并由于他们在中国共产党的影响下具有一定的政治条件和组织条件，就成了国民党统治区人民响应中国共产党抗日民主主张的先锋。北平的两万多学生，他们冲破了国民党军警及其大刀、水龙、木棍、皮鞭的镇压，举行了两次大示威。虽然有一百多学生受伤和被捕，但是不仅北平的学生没有被吓退，而且他们的运动迅速扩展到天津、上海、南京、杭州、武汉、广州、济南、开封、太原等地的学生中，并且迅速扩展到城市的工人、职员、自由职业者和其他爱国分子中。学生们先后成立了北平学联、全国学联、民族解放先锋队等团体，其他阶层的人民则成立了各界救国会和救国联合会。由“一二九”开始的国民党统治区人民爱国民主运动，一直继续发展到一九三七年七月抗日战争的爆发，成为推动抗日战争爆发的重要力量之一。
    抗日战争结束于一九四五年八月的日本投降。中国共产党领导全国人民要求在抗日战争结束以后，制止内战危机，废除国民党一党专政，成立民主联合政府，以建立独立、和平、民主的新中国。中国共产党领袖毛泽东主席，在八月底亲赴国民党政府所在地重庆，与蒋介石进行和平谈判，其结果是十月十日公布的国共两党会谈纪要，其中规定着双方同意“坚决避免内战”。但是国民党反动派及其美国主人实际上是企图夺取人民在八年抗日战争中的奋斗成果，将中国回复到旧的黑暗的统治之下，并且由美国代替日本来统治中国。他们随即撕毁了双十节的协议，发动了大规模的内战进攻人民解放军。到十一月初，国民党政府使用于反革命内战的全力已达一百万人，这些军队很多是由美国派来中国的海空军以帮助“受降”名义所运输到内战前线上去的。国民党反动派和美国反动派的凶恶反革命计划，不但受到了人民解放军和解放区人民的坚决抵抗，并且受到了国民党统治区人民的坚决反对。昆明各学校（其中主要的是抗日战争中由北平、天津等地迁来的学校）的学生，是这时反对反革命内战，反对美国政府援助国民党进行反革命内战的积极分子。国民党反动派嫡系的军队这时已经在美国军事援助下推翻了龙云在昆明的统治，昆明学生的运动受到了严重的压迫。十一月二十五日，昆明学生的反内战座谈会受到国民党军警开枪破坏。二十六日，昆明三万学生宣布总罢课。他们不顾国民党的迫害，举行沿街宣传，要求停正内战，实行民主，成立民主联合政府，要求美军退出中国去。十二月一日，国民党驻军邱清泉部和国民党特务机关联合攻打昆明西南联合大学、中法大学和联大附中等校，毒打学生和教师，并向学生集会的地方投掷手榴弹，炸伤炸死西南联大学生潘琰、李鲁连，高级工业学校学生张华昌，南菁中学教员于再等四人。与反动派的企图相反，“一二一”惨案不曾把全国反内战运动缩小了，而是把这一运动扩大了。中国共产党和中国人民继续为和平而坚决奋斗的结果，造成了一九四六年一月政治协商会议的召开和停战令的发布。但是国民党反动派仍然在美国反动派援助之下，撕毁了政协决议和停战令，重行发动了全国规模的反革命的大内战。这样就使得全国反对内战、争取和平的人民和青年得到了一个根本的觉悟，懂得了为着要消灭任何内战，实现真正和平，只有一条道路，这就是全国人民团结起来，用人民解放战争，坚决地彻底地干净地全部地消灭国民党的反动军队，打倒国民党的反动统治，驱逐美帝国主义的侵略势力出中国，建立统一的民主的人民共和国。除此以外，再没有别的道路。
    “一二九”运动追求两个目标：抗日和民主。抗日战争，在“一二九”的两年以后是实现了，并且在八个年头中将日本侵略者打倒了。这样就取得了一个伟大的胜利，替中国人民解放事业开辟了广泛的道路和真正的可能性。但民主的要求，则不但在“一二九”运动中没有实现，在抗日时期中在大部分中国也没有实现。因此，在“一二一”时期，仍然是一个中心口号。“一二一”时期，人民和青年要求和平，要求民主，要求美军退出中国，这些要求，随着中国人民解放战争的迅速发展，现在正日益接近于最后的胜利。
