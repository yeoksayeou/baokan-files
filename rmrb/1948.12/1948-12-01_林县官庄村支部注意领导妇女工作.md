[Taihang Telegraph] The women's work in Guanzhuang Village, Lin County, has greatly improved under the active leadership and assistance of the village branch of the Party. Because of the special attention paid to guiding women's production and conducting down-to-earth mediation of family disputes, the past erroneous views of the masses on women's work have been changed. In the past, the leadership component of the village branch was impure, and the female cadres promoted were not upright, and they could not establish prestige among the masses. After repeated rectifications, the branch has been strengthened, but it still did not pay enough attention to women's work and did not help improve the leadership in a timely manner. It was not until last winter, when they saw the active role of women in Rencun and Sangerzhuang in the land reform at that time, that they prompted the branch to decide to improve women's work. After discussion at the branch meeting, everyone unanimously agreed that: If we want to do a good job in women's work, we must first lay a solid foundation. According to the past work performance, everyone found four upright women as training targets. After practical work, it was proved that they could do things for the masses and were supported by everyone. Two of them were elected as chairman and vice-chairman of the Women's Federation respectively. The branch also often studied women's work and helped them solve difficulties. At the suggestion of the branch, the village government also determined that the director of civil education should cooperate with the women's cadres to be responsible for mediating family discords. In this way, family discords gradually decreased, and the prestige of the Women's Federation gradually increased. In this end of the land reform, the branch studied how to mobilize women. When the representatives were elected, six of the nineteen representatives in the village were women. When classifying class status, the men were all in the fields during the day, and the women were responsible for propaganda, and they reported the opinions of the masses to the representative meeting that night. The reason why women in the village can play a role in land reform is first because the branch has cultivated a group of cadres and activists who can work, are upright, and are enthusiastic about their work. Twenty women cadres above the group leader in the village are very active, have prestige among the masses, and can also solve disputes among the masses. The second is the constant leadership of the branch. Usually, it not only arranges women's work, but also pays attention to solving difficulties and providing specific assistance at any time, so that the content of women's work is combined with the immediate interests of the masses. For example, leading women's production has played a role, and the masses support it very much. Also, solving family disputes and solving the difficulties in the daily life of the masses have broken the illusion of the masses that the Women's Federation is specifically provoking divorces.

　　林县官庄村支部
  　注意领导妇女工作
    【太行电】林县官庄村妇女工作，在党的村支部积极领导帮助下，已大有改进。由于特别注意领导了妇女生产和对家庭纠纷进行了设身处地的调解，已一改过去群众对妇女工作的错误观点。该村支部过去领导成份不纯，提拔的妇女干部也不正派，她们在群众中无法建立威信。经过屡次整顿，支部已健全起来，但仍对妇女工作注意不够，仍未及时帮助改进领导。直至去冬看到任村、桑尔庄妇女在当时土改中的积极作用，才促使支部决心着手改进妇女工作。经过支部会研究，大家一致认为：要想搞好妇女工作，得首先把根扎正。大家根据以往工作表现，找了四个正派的妇女作为培养对象，经过实际工作锻炼，证明确能为群众办事，并受到大家的拥护，其中有两个分别被选为妇女会正副主席。支部也经常研究妇女工作，帮助她们解决困难。在支部建议下，村政府并确定民教主任协同妇女干部，经常负责调解家庭不和问题。这样，家庭不和即逐渐减少，妇联会的威信也随之逐渐提高。这次结束土改中，支部又研究了如何发动妇女。到选代表时，全村十九个代表，其中有六个是妇女，划阶级时，男人白天都上地了，妇女们就负责宣传，当晚并把群众意见反映到代表会上。该村妇女所以能在土改中起作用，首先因为支部培养了一批能劳动、为人正派、工作热心的干部和积极分子。全村小组长以上的妇女干部二十个，都很积极，在群众中也有威信，又能解决群众中的纠纷。其次是支部经常的领导，平常不但布置妇女工作，而且随时注意解决困难，具体帮助，使妇女工作的内容和群众切身利益结合起来。如领导妇女生产起了作用，群众很拥护。又给解决家庭纠纷，解决群众日常生活上的困难，打破了群众认为妇联会就是专门挑拨离婚的错觉。
