　　Cadre Learning Issues
　　Propaganda Department of the Seventh Prefectural Committee of Hebei-Shandong-Henan

　　(1) Cadre Testing Situation
　　The Seventh Prefectural Committee of Hebei-Shandong-Henan held a cadre test. A total of 162 cadres participated in the unified test, including one from the Prefectural Committee, 37 at the county level, and 124 at the district level. The test results showed that the Prefectural Committee cadre scored 60 points; the county-level cadres averaged 49 points; and the district-level cadres averaged slightly above 40 points. The highest score was 80, achieved by two individuals, and some submitted blank papers. The test revealed that the political and cultural level of the general cadres was too low. Many county-level cadres were unaware of the Party's general line and general policy at the current stage, and some even could not clearly define the Party's general line and general policy on land reform during the period of New Democracy.
　　The purpose of the test was to understand the political and cultural level of the cadres, and also to stimulate and encourage their enthusiasm for learning. For example, Comrade Li Xiumin of Jining County said: "I only got fifteen points, what a shame! I must study hard." However, some individual comrades held the mistaken view that "it doesn't matter if I can't answer, I won't be demoted anyway."
　　We believe that the content of learning should be determined based on the test results and coordinated with the central tasks of certain work, rather than grabbing at random. A month or a quarter should be considered a learning period. The test results should be reviewed in detail and graded, and then published on a list. Furthermore, each person's test paper should be posted on the bulletin board or circulated for mutual review. At the same time, the Academic Committee should provide correct answers, so that the test itself can be considered a learning climax.

　　(2) How to conduct theoretical and Party document study?
　　In the past, most units adopted a laissez-faire attitude towards learning. Documents were only read once or twice, or discussed in an unprepared and unfocused "empty-handed market gathering," which naturally failed to arouse everyone's interest and enthusiasm for learning, and the results were even more unsatisfactory.
　　However, this time we focused on connecting ourselves with the study of documents. For example, after studying the District Party Committee's instruction of October 10th, the Nanwang Fifth District immediately reviewed the past disorganized and undisciplined state of randomly detaining people, external cadres not returning after leave, and local cadres freely returning home. Another method is to raise questions and collect relevant theoretical books and documents for study. Both of these methods require in-depth study and a thorough understanding of the basic spirit of the documents and issues. Only in this way can we guarantee the mood for learning and deeply experience the guiding significance of theory for work.

　　(3) On the cultural learning of worker-peasant cadres
　　"I'm old, my memory is not good." "My hands that touch hoes can't hold a pen!" "I'm too busy with work, I don't have time to learn to read!"... These are indeed ideological obstacles for worker-peasant cadres to learn cultural lessons. But on the other hand, they can also feel the benefits of literacy. For example, Comrade Chen Degui, the district head of Jining County, received a letter from the county but couldn't read it. If he asked someone else, he was afraid of revealing secrets; moreover, if he wanted to send a letter to his lover, he would have to ask someone to write it for him, which would be ridiculous! -- This is a personally experienced difficulty. But most importantly, cultural learning must be elevated to the height of a political task. Only in this way can we consciously persevere in learning.
　　In November, a symposium on cultural learning for worker-peasant cadres was held in the Nanwang key district. It broke down the conservative thinking of unwillingness to learn and promoted the learning experience of various successful groups, solving the problem of the lack of teachers. Particularly commendable is Comrade Wan Yun of Guotang Village in Nanwang First District, who volunteered to help everyone learn. In the past month, the learning situation has been very good: Comrades Hu Zhufa and Fan Xianfu of the Third District have learned more than 100 characters; Comrade Wang Yueying of the District Committee bought a fountain pen and ordered exercise books; and four female comrades from the Juye Second District regularly learn two or three characters every day, and some can already write simple letters.
　　At present, the cultural learning of the entire worker-peasant cadre force is only just beginning and is very fragmented. In the future, it should be learned step by step. The following are some of our experiences: First, the learning content should be determined according to different levels of education (from illiterate to upper primary school and junior high school). It is best to gradually teach from primary school to junior high school textbooks, so that they can reach the cultural level of junior high school, and not be limited to just learning individual characters, so that they can acquire some necessary scientific knowledge -- this is a long-term process. Second, all worker-peasant cadres should be mobilized politically and ideologically to learn cultural lessons, creating a learning upsurge and mutual supervision. Third, Academic Committees at all levels should be organized to strengthen leadership, summarize experiences, conduct regular inspections, establish mutual aid groups and "little teacher" systems, and teachers should have the spirit of "tireless teaching." Fourth, establish a learning system and discipline, with regular examinations, carry out learning competitions, commend models, and stipulate that learning performance and attitude are one of the main contents of assessing the quality of cadres. At least two hours of study time should be scheduled every day, preferably in the morning. If it is delayed due to work, time must be taken to make up the lesson.

　　(4) Oppose Complacency and Conceit
　　Although some progress has been made in this period of study, there are still many comrades who are forced to study. For example, when the Jining County Party Committee studied the District Party Committee's instruction "Oppose Anarchy and Disorganization," everyone was not active and could not continue learning. After inspection, it was found that everyone's purpose of learning was not clear. Some were there to decorate themselves to make others look up to them; some to take the lead in response to the call of the superiors; some because of the test, fearing embarrassment if they couldn't answer. Comrade Yun Yunping, the county magistrate of ×× County, believed that he was neither corrupt nor degenerate, and was very complacent, so he had not read Party documents for a long time, only skimming the "Q&A" section of the newspaper. Comrade Sun Guozhen, the deputy director of the Public Security Bureau of × County, said: "The work is very easy, why bother to study?" Comrade Cheng Jiu, the organization minister of a certain county, felt that he had his own way and had been "purely" successful in the past without hitting any snags, so there was no need to learn. The above all showed complacency and conceit, being stuck in the old ways, empiricism, not seeking progress, and having no sense of new things. -- We must thoroughly and consciously examine ourselves, especially the leading comrades, otherwise we are not good students and good cadres of Chairman Mao!

### 干部的学习问题　冀鲁豫七地委宣传部

　　干部的学习问题
  　冀鲁豫七地委宣传部
    （一）干部测验情况
    冀鲁豫七地委举行了一次干部测验，参加统一测验的干部共一百六十二人，其中地委一人，县级干部三十七人，区级干部一百二十四人。测验结果，地委一人六十分；县级三十七人，平均四十九分；区级一百二十四人，平均四十分强。全部答案中最高八十分两人；最低有缴白卷者。从测验中可以看到，一般干部政治和文化水平太低，许多县级干部不知道我党现阶段的总路线、总政策，甚至搞不清我党在新民主主义时期的土地改革的总路线、总政策是什么。
    测验的目的是要了解干部的政治水平和文化水平，同时也有刺激和鼓励大家学习热情的作用。如济宁县李修民同志说：“才得了十五分，真丢人！说啥咱也得好好学习。”但也有个别同志认为“答不上来，反正也不能降级”的错误观点。
    我们认为：要根据测验的结果，来规定学习的内容及配合一定工作的中心任务，不要乱抓一把。以月或季为一学习段落，对测验的结果，要详细评阅定分，且予以列榜公布，再用墙报的形式，将每人试卷贴出或互相传阅，同时，学委会作出正确答案，这样能使测验本身就算为一个学习高潮。
    （二）如何进行理论及党的文件学习？
    过去多数单位，对于学习采取自流放任，文件只看它一两遍，或无准备、无边际的“空手赶集”的讨论一下就算了，这样当然引不起大家的学习兴趣和热情，收效更不必谈了。
    但这次我们注重了从学习文件中去连系自己。如南旺五区在研究区党委十月十日的指示后，即刻检讨了过去随便押人，外来干部请假到时不归，地方干部自由回家的无组织、无纪律的状态。另一种是以提出问题，搜集有关的各种理论书籍和文件，进行学习。以上两种，都必须要钻研、要弄通文件和问题的基本精神。只有这样，才能保证学习的情绪，才能深切体验到理论对工作的指导意义。
    （三）关于工农干部的文化学习
    “人大了，记性不好。”“咱这摸锄扛把的手，可提不动笔！”“工作忙得不得了，哪有空来认字？”……这的确是工农干部学习文化课的思想障碍。但在另外一方面，他们也能感到认字的好处，如济宁县区长陈德桂同志，接到县里送来的信，没法看，找人吧，心里又怕泄露了秘密；再说，要给自己爱人捎个信，也得找人代笔，岂不笑话！——这是切身体验到的困难。而最重要的，还是要把学习文化课，提到政治任务的高度。只有如此，才可能自觉的坚持学习下去。
    十一月份，在南旺重点区，召开了一个工农干部文化课学习座谈会。打通不愿学习的保守思想，并推广了各有成绩小组的学习经验，解决了没有教员的问题。值得特别表扬的是南旺一区郭堂村的万云同志，他自动出来帮助大家学习。一个月来，学习情况很好：三区胡住法、范先福等同志学会了一百多个字；区委王月盈同志买下了钢笔，订了练习本，巨野二区四个女同志经常每天规定学二、三个字，有的已经能写简单的信。
    目前整个工农干部的文化课学习，还只能算是开始，并且很零乱，今后当按步就班的学。下面是我们的一些经验：第一、按各种不同的文化程度（从文盲至高小、初中）规定不同的学习内容，最好是从初小到初中的课本，逐步教授，使之能达到初中程度的文化水平，不要局限于光学单字的圈子，使之能获得一些必要的科学知识——这是一个长期过程。第二、从政治上、思想上动员所有的工农干部学习文化课，造成学习热潮，并使互相监督。第三、组织各级学委会，加强领导，要能总结经验，定期检查，建立互助组、小先生制度，教员要有“诲人不倦”的精神。第四、建立学习制度和纪律，要有定期的考试，开展学习竞赛，表扬模范，并规定学习的成绩和态度是鉴定干部好坏主要内容之一。每天最少规定二小时学习时间，最好在早晨，如因工作耽误，必须抽时间补课。
    （四）反对自满自大
    这段学习虽有了些成绩，但是仍有不少的同志是被迫学习的。如济宁县委会在学习区党委指示“反对无政府无组织”的文件时，大家都不积极，学不下去，经检查，发现大家学习的目的不明确，有的是来装饰自己，好叫别人看得起；为了上级号召要带头；为了测验，怕答不来丢脸。××县长云允平同志认为自己既不贪污，又不腐化，很自满，所以长期不看党的文件，仅仅翻一下报上的“有问必答”而已。×县公安副局长孙国珍同志说：“工作容易得很，何必学习？”某县组织部长程九同志觉得自己有一套，过去“净”是成功，没碰钉子，所以用不着学。以上都表现出了自满自大，老一套，经验主义，不求上进，没有对新鲜事物的感觉。——我们必须彻底的自觉检讨自己，尤其是领导同志，否则就不是毛主席的好学生、好干部！（林晰整理）
