Look inside, take a look inside, the victory southwest of Xuzhou is wonderfully fought. The People's Liberation Army cast a net, surrounding three bandit armies of Chiang Kai-shek, unable to escape; Sun Yuanliang's one bandit army, was wiped out in one fell swoop; From December 2nd to 8th, more than thirty regiments were eliminated. The People's Liberation Army is still surrounding and attacking, and will not spare those who do not surrender!

Looking south along the railway again, the victory southwest of Su County is also wonderfully fought. Huang Wei's one bandit army, has long been surrounded by the People's Liberation Army; In a small area of several miles, there is no food, no drink, and few bullets; Some revolted, some surrendered, and those who did not surrender were hit by heavy artillery; They ran around in confusion trying to escape, but could not escape the PLA's big encirclement! Chiang Kai-shek also sent bandit troops to rescue, but they were held back by us and couldn't arrive. Seeing that the entire army is about to be finished, Huang Wei is even more distressed these days: Liu Bocheng and Chen Yi issued an order, telling him to surrender and hand over his guns quickly; If he still refuses to surrender, let him take a look at Huang Botao!

(Huang Botao's bandit army, which was east of Xuzhou some time ago, was surrounded by the People's Liberation Army and refused to surrender, and has already been completely resolved.)

    淮海围歼战大胜
    往里头看来往里头瞧，徐州西南胜仗打得好。解放军撒下天罗网，围住蒋匪三个兵团不得跑；孙元良一个匪兵团，一下子就叫消灭掉；十二月二号到八号，三十多个团都叫咱消灭了。解放军还正在围着打，他不投降定不饶！
    顺着铁路再往南边瞧，宿县西南胜仗也打得妙。黄维的一个匪兵团，早叫解放军团团包；几里方圆的小地方，没吃没喝子弹少；有的起义有的投降，不投降的挨大炮；乱碰乱撞还想跑，跑不出解放军的大圈套！蒋介石又调匪军来救援，也叫咱顶住来不到。眼看全兵团快完蛋，黄维近日更苦恼：刘伯承陈毅两将军下了令，叫他快些投降把枪缴；如果还不肯投降，叫他看看黄伯韬！
    （黄伯韬匪部一个兵团前些时在徐州以东，被解放军包围不肯投降，早已经叫完全解决。）
