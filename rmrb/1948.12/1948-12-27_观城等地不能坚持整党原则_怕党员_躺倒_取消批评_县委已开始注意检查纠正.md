　　[Jilu Yu Electric Dispatch] Guancheng, Shouzhang, Fanxian and other counties exposed and initially corrected the right-leaning tendencies in the "left" leaning of the party rectification work in various places. During the party rectification this spring, "left" leaning deviations occurred in various places, where old organizations were kicked aside and party members were handed over to the masses for handling. Since the district party committee's June meeting implemented the spirit of correcting policies, the counties gradually clarified the spirit of correcting deviations and the line of uniting branch activists and better elements to jointly lead, and restored the activities of the branches. However, following this correction of the "left," a right-leaning tendency emerged, mainly manifested in: First, regarding party rectification as several isolated stages. For example, Gao Xinhe, the chairman of the farmers' association in the key village of Menghai, Shouzhang, embezzled more than 70,000 yuan of the farmers' association's public funds and still refused to admit it; the militia squad leader (a party member) had an improper work style and was detached from the masses, but the work team did not combine preliminary party rectification to launch criticism and self-criticism. After inspecting the work in two key villages, including Menghai, the county party committee believed that this approach did not understand the spirit of party rectification, mechanically dividing party rectification into several stages, and saying that all problems would be dealt with when that stage arrived, "I will rectify you later," thus relaxing the correction of serious current deviations. Second, regarding preliminary party rectification as simply restoring the emotions of village cadres and dispelling the concerns of party members. For example, when Liu Yugui (a middle peasant with hooligan habits), the branch secretary of Zhangtang Village, Liaoyang, was passive in attending branch meetings, the leadership was afraid of fluctuating the emotions of other cadres, and did not dare to deal with it in a timely manner. For example, the work in Dasi Village, Shouzhang, only restored morale within the party whenever it was difficult to move forward. Lowering the principles of the party, not daring to launch a correct ideological struggle. Third, underestimating party rectification and neglecting impurity within the party. For example, the Guancheng County Party Committee pointed out when inspecting the work in September and October: Some comrades ideologically believed that there were no major problems within the party, and even believed that party rectification was superfluous. Fourth, relying entirely on the branch to promote work. (It is not wrong to "rely entirely on the branch to promote work," the problem lies in relying on good branches and party members, closely contacting and organizing the masses to complete various tasks. - Editor) For example, in Yangji, Liaoyang, "uniting the activists and better elements within the branch to lead jointly" was transformed into "relying entirely on the branch to promote work." Ideologically, it was believed that the masses were slow to respond, and after the branch clarified its thinking, it took the lead in responding to everything. This situation also appeared in Fanxian County. It was said that correcting policies must go through the branch, and even branches with ties to landlords and rich peasants were relied upon. Fifth, leaders sharing responsibility became all-encompassing. For example, after the Puyang County Party Committee reviewed the error of kicking aside old organizations without distinguishing the situation in the training camp for party member village cadres, affirmed the achievements of land reform, and assumed responsibility for the deviations that occurred in land reform, it did not effectively criticize and struggle against party member village cadres who had committed serious errors, thinking, "If we can't even help them stand up, can we still rectify them?" Sixth, fearing to scare party members, they did not dare to raise the awareness of party members and promote democracy to accept criticism from the masses. The root cause of this right-leaning deviation is that some cadres did not recognize the great achievements of past party rectification, and had complaints in their hearts; some district and sub-district cadres, due to historical and local relationships in their work, had unprincipled sympathy for the shortcomings of certain village cadres. Leading rural party rectification with this kind of leadership ideology inevitably leads to right-leaning deviations. Secondly, some cadres do not understand what party rectification is and what preliminary party rectification is, and do not know how to earnestly seek ideological consistency and unity of position within the party, and launch criticism to raise awareness. There is also a purely task-oriented view, holding a utilitarian view of branches and village cadres, as long as they can "complete" the tasks given by the leadership, without paying attention to the ideological improvement of party members. The county party committees of the respective counties have begun to pay attention to correcting this deviation.

### 观城等地不能坚持整党原则　怕党员“躺倒”取消批评  县委已开始注意检查纠正

　　观城等地不能坚持整党原则
  　怕党员“躺倒”取消批评
    县委已开始注意检查纠正
    【冀鲁豫电】观城、寿张、范县等县揭发并初步纠正各地整党工作纠“左”中的右倾偏向。在今春整党中，各地先后都曾发生了踢开老组织把党员交群众处理的“左”倾偏向。自区党委六月会议贯彻端正政策的精神后，各县逐渐明确了纠偏精神及团结支部积极分子较好分子去共同领导的路线，恢复了支部的活动。但跟着这种纠“左”，却又产生了一种右的偏向，主要表现在：一、把整党当成几个孤立阶段。如寿张孟海重点村农会长高心合贪污农会公款七万多元还不承认；民兵班长（党员）作风不正脱离群众，但工作组都没去结合初步整党展开批评与自我批评。县委会检查了孟海等两个重点村的工作后，认为这种作法，是不了解整党的精神，把整党机械分成几段，一切问题等到这一阶段到来再说，“将来我再整你”，因此就放松了对目前严重偏向的纠正。二、把初步整党看成为只是单纯恢复村干情绪，解除党员顾虑。如聊阳张堂村支书刘玉贵（中农，有流氓习气）开支部会时消极不到，领导上怕波动其他干部情绪，致不敢及时处理。如寿张大寺村工作，什么时候走不动时，就在党内恢复一下情绪。把党的原则降低，不敢去展开正确的思想斗争。三、看轻整党忽视党内不纯。如观城县委会检查九、十月份工作时指出：有的同志思想上认为党内问题不大，甚至认为整党是多余的。四、一切依靠支部推动工作。（“一切依靠支部推动工作”并非错误，问题在于必须依靠好的支部和党员，密切联系与组织群众，来完成各种工作。——编者）如聊阳杨集，把“团结支部内的积极分子较好分子共同领导”变成为“一切依靠支部推动工作”，思想上认为群众响应的迟慢，支部打通思想后，凡事带头响应。范县也出现这种情况，一说端正政策要经过支部，就连与地富有联系的支部，也依靠起来。五、领导上分担责任变成大包大揽。如濮县县委在党员村干训的所里检讨了不分别情况，踢开老组织的错误，肯定了土改成绩，把土改中发生偏向的责任承担起来之后，而对犯有严重错误的党员村干没有进行有效的批评斗争，认为“扶都扶不起来，还能整吗？”六、怕把党员吓倒，不敢提高党员的觉悟，发扬民主去接受群众的批评。产生这种右倾偏向的根源，首先是由于有些干部没有认识过去整党的伟大成绩，且心中不满时有怨言；有的区干和小区干部，由于工作的历史关系和地方关系，对某些村干部的缺点抱有无原则的同情，以这种领导思想去领导农村整党，就必然产生右倾偏向。其次是一部分干部对什么是整党，什么是初步整党不了解，不知道去认真的求得党内的思想一致，立场一致，展开批评提高觉悟。还有就是单纯的任务观点，对支部和村干抱有使用观点，只要他能“完成”领导上所给的任务就行，不去注意党员的思想提高。现各该县县委已开始对此种偏向注意纠正。
