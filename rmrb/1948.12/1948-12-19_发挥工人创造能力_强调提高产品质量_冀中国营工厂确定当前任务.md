　　Give Play to Workers' Creativity
  　Emphasize Improving Product Quality
  　Hope for State-Owned Factories in Hebei-Chahar-Jehol to Determine Current Tasks
　　[This newspaper's dispatch] This newspaper reporter Xing Jun reports: The Hebei-Chahar-Jehol Industrial Company convened a meeting of state-owned factory directors in mid-November. In light of the rapid development of the situation and the current favorable season, they decided to launch a production campaign focused on improving quality. In addition to studying cost accounting, the meeting focused on discussing the issue of improving product quality. According to reports from various factories, although product quality has improved significantly, it is still not entirely satisfactory. In October, the match factory experienced a backlog of more than 4,000 bundles of matches due to poor quality, making them difficult to sell, and nearly ceased production. Only after improving quality did they meet demand. The chemical factory's alkali products sometimes lacked weight, with some buckets short by four or five pounds, and the black sediment was as large as four inches. Furthermore, the packaging was unattractive. The iron factory's waterwheels were unusable, and the masses went to the administrative office to complain. The dyeing and weaving factory's technical improvements were too slow, and the fabrics had too many flaws, leading to frequent returns from fabric merchants. The reasons for this were examined: First, the company's leadership lacked clear thinking. The previous factory director meeting only emphasized increasing quantity and strengthening procurement, with little discussion on improving quality. Furthermore, product inspections were perfunctory. For example, the quality of potassium sulfate-produced alkali was still very poor, but it was approved for immediate production and delivery without waiting for improvements. Second, in terms of business management, there were "profit-only" views and a reliance on policy protection. Therefore, the importance of improving product quality to establish a brand name and open up sales channels was overlooked. After discussion, it was believed that the issue of how to improve product quality in the future should be addressed from the following aspects: (1) In terms of cadre ideology, it should be clear that New Democratic industrial production is to solve military and civilian needs in a planned manner, and production should not be blindly pursued for profit. (2) The basic method of improving quality is to follow the mass line and rely on the creativity of the workers. This requires close integration of the administration, the trade union, and the Party branch to carry out in-depth mobilization. Because taking a step forward based on the workers' old ways will encounter many difficulties. At the same time, technical workers and the section chiefs responsible for directing production should systematically organize workers to study and improve technology, and, based on technology, tools, and various conditions, specific discussions should be held in groups and sections to formulate plans for improving product quality. Those with excellent performance should be rewarded. (3) Strengthen technical guidance and, where possible, improve tools. Currently, the leather factory can use machine peeling shafts to maintain the cleanliness and roundness of the leather shafts; the match factory can manufacture machine drug mixing machines to ensure the uniformity of the match heads; the chemical factory can renovate the settling pool or increase the alkali extraction pot to reduce impurities in the alkali. Regarding technical guidance, in addition to implementing the spirit of the North China Industry and Commerce Conference, which requires factory directors and technicians to be jointly responsible, it is emphasized that technical cadres should integrate with the workers. On the one hand, they should contact the engineering department and work with it to provide in-depth guidance on production; on the other hand, they should closely integrate with the business department to guide procurement and check the authenticity and quality of raw materials, so as not to affect quality due to poor raw materials. (4) Strictly enforce the product inspection system. When a factory produces a new product or changes the original raw materials, it must report the brand name, raw materials, cost, and samples to the industrial company for approval. In addition to the factory director conducting inspections on time and in batches, mutual inspections between groups and sections can also be adopted. Products that do not meet the standards are prohibited from leaving the factory, and those that have already left the factory should be retrieved if possible. Otherwise, the inspectors will be responsible for damaging the brand name. In the event that the product quality is reduced due to carelessness, but the quantity is large and the market needs it, a secondary brand name can be determined, or no brand name at all. Finally, according to the company's requirements for improving product quality, the match factory proposed to guarantee that 95% of the matches would strike well, be evenly packed in boxes, have few rotten stems, and that the size of the medicine head, oil head, and sulfur head would be consistent, and the trademark would be clear and upright. The chemical factory proposed to strive to catch up with red alkali in terms of sodium sulfide, immediately reduce the residue to below two inches, and improve packaging; sodium sulfide green powder would dye five feet of cloth per two liang, and paste would dye four feet of cloth per two liang. The dyeing and weaving factory guaranteed that the colors would be beautiful and permanent, the prints would be straight, the color matching would be uniform, and the number of defective products would be reduced. Iron factories, leather factories, etc., have also successively proposed guarantee conditions. The production campaign to improve quality is now underway.

### 发挥工人创造能力　强调提高产品质量　冀中国营工厂确定当前任务

　　发挥工人创造能力
  　强调提高产品质量
  　冀中国营工厂确定当前任务
    【本报讯】本报记者行军报导：冀中实业公司于上月中旬，召开国营工厂厂长会议，针对形势的迅速发展和目前有利季节，确定开展以提高质量为主的生产运动。该会除对成本核算作了研究外，着重讨论了提高产品质量问题。根据各厂汇报，产品质量虽有不少进步，但还不能完全令人满意。十月份，火柴厂因火柴质量低，不易销售，一度积压四千多席，几乎停工；后提高质量，才达到供不应求。化学厂出品臭碱，有的质量斤秤不够，一桶相差四五斤，黑底子最大的到四英寸，同时装璜也不美观。宏业铁厂的水车，因不能用，群众找到行署去控告。染轧厂因技术改进太慢，染的布花又过多，布贩经常退布回水。检讨原因：一是公司领导思想不明确，上次厂长会议只强调增加数量加强采购，对提高质量却很少研究，同时对产品的检查也草率，如硫酸钾制的臭碱质量还很差，不待改进便批准立即生产出厂。二是经营管理上，存有“唯利是图”和单纯依赖政策保护的观点。因此忽视提高产品质量，以创牌子打开销路。对今后如何提高产品质量问题，经过讨论，认为应从下列几方面着手：（一）在干部思想上，应明确新民主主义的工业生产，是有计划地解决军需民用，不应盲目地为追逐利润而生产。（二）提高质量的基本方法，是走群众路线，依靠工人群众发挥创造。这就必须行政、工会、支部三位一体密切结合，进行深入地启发动员。因为在工人旧一套做法的基础上提高一步，会遇到不少困难。同时又赖技术工人和指挥生产的股长有计划地组织工人研究改进技术，并根据技术、工具和各方面的条件，分组分股具体讨论，订出提高产品质量的计划，对成绩优良者应有所奖励。（三）加强技术指导，有条件地改进工具。目前可以作到的，皮厂改用机器旋皮轴，能保持皮轴的洁净和一定的圆度；火柴厂可制机器油药机，保护火柴头的均匀；化学厂改造澄清池或增加出碱锅，以减少臭碱杂质。关于技术指导上除贯彻华北工商会议厂长技师共同负责的精神外，强调技术干部要与工人结合，一方面与工务部门取得联系，协同工务部门深入指导生产；另一方面与经营部门密切结合，指导采购，检查原料的真假和好坏，以免因原料不好而影响质量。（四）严格产品检查制度。各厂新出一种产品或改变原来原料时，要将牌号，原料，成本，样品报告实业公司批准；产品除按时按批由厂长主持进行检验外，还可采用组与组股与股的互相检验，不合标准的禁止出品，已出厂者设法追回，否则作倒了牌子由检验人员负责。偶而不慎，使产品质量降低而数量较大又为市场需要者，可确定副牌号或不弄牌号。最后根据公司提高产品质量的要求，火柴厂提出保证火柴百分之九十五好划，装盒均匀，烂梗子少，药头、油头、磺头大小一致，商标清楚端正。化学厂提出硫化碱努力赶上红化碱，底子立即作到二英寸以下，并改进包装；硫化青粉每两染布五尺，膏子每两染布四尺。染轧厂保证颜色美观，保持永久，印花周正，配色均匀，减少残品。铁工厂皮革厂等也均先后提出保证条件。现在提高质量的生产运动正开展中。
