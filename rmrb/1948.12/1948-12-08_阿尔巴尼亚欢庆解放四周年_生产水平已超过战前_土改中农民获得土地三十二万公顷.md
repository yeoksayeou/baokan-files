　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 3rd: TASS, Tirana: On November 29th, Albania celebrated the fourth anniversary of its liberation from the iron heel of fascist aggressors and the establishment of a people's democratic state. This day also marked the 36th anniversary of Albania's declaration of independence in 1912. The Albanian people commemorated these two milestones in their history with significant achievements. In a short period, they have surpassed pre-war production levels, built 10,000 houses, restored all bridges destroyed during the war, built new roads and two railways, and completed large-scale land reclamation. In the land reform, Albanian peasants obtained 320,000 hectares of arable land. Within four years, 109,000 illiterate people learned to read and write. The total number of students in primary, secondary, and vocational schools across the country reached 108,000 (out of a national population of approximately one million), exceeding pre-war figures. The total circulation of Albanian newspapers has also increased three and a half times. A network of cultural centers has been established, and medical services for the people have been greatly improved.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 3rd: TASS, Moscow: Soviet writer Ilya Ehrenburg, who recently visited Albania, wrote an article on the occasion of the fourth anniversary of Albania's liberation from fascist occupation, extending warm congratulations to the Albanian people. Ehrenburg wrote: "Four years ago, the world discovered a new country - Albania. Before that, everyone only knew a country with Italian capital and American agents. Four years ago, the world saw that this country was inhabited by brave and proud people. The world discovered Albania because Albania discovered herself—her own will, path, and soul. Albania's birth was not at the command of Washington, nor due to the wishes of London. She was born in the flames of war, in the throes of pain, in the struggles of the guerrillas. During these years, the Soviet people engaged in a life-and-death battle far from Albania, destroying the enemies of the Albanian people on the Volga and the Dniester. The fourth anniversary we celebrate today is also a great festival for us. We helped the world discover Albania, helped Albania discover herself, and we can be proud of this. There are no small countries, nor small peoples. The greatness of the human soul cannot be measured by numbers. Now, we see the old British lion complaining about Albania. A nation with such enemies is a great nation. Today, I think back to your amazing country, its mountain paths, winding roads, ancient cities, its heroic, cheerful, and richly endowed people. I now see with the eyes of my soul the places where Albanians sacrificed themselves for freedom—Mount Dajti. I say again: Congratulations—Land of Eagles! Congratulations to you—Albanian friends! Long live your freedom! Long live our friendship!"
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 4th: TASS: The Soviet newspaper Izvestia published an article commenting on the fourth anniversary of the founding of independent and democratic Albania, stating: Albania's people's democratic government has implemented the most important political, social, and economic reforms, completely freed itself from the rule of foreign imperialism, and created the preconditions for Albania to move towards socialism. The development of Albania's economy has now reached pre-war levels. Coal and oil production has exceeded pre-war levels, and electricity production has increased threefold compared to pre-war levels. For the first time in Albania's history, the significant issue of building a modern industry that can meet the needs of economic development and the demands of the people has been raised. After the land reform, two-thirds of the rural population, totaling 527,000 people, benefited, and the cultivated area and harvest have now exceeded pre-war levels. Under the rule of the royalist fascist regime, almost all of the Albanian people were illiterate. Now, seven-year universal compulsory education has been almost completely implemented domestically. The number of schools and students has tripled compared to 1938. For the first time in Albania's history, institutions of higher learning have been established—universities, teachers' colleges, agricultural research institutes, music schools, and art schools. Albanian women have been liberated from the shackles of slavery in the family and the country, and have risen to participate in political and cultural life. There are 1,100 women who are members of the People's Assembly, and more than 7,500 women have assumed important positions in government, public institutions, and industrial sectors. The threats and provocations of the imperialist camp have not been able to shake democratic Albania. The Albanian people have drawn strength and confidence from the support and assistance of the entire democratic camp, especially the Soviet people.

　　阿尔巴尼亚欢庆解放四周年
  　生产水平已超过战前
    土改中农民获得土地三十二万公顷
    【新华社陕北三日电】塔斯社地拉那讯：十一月二十九日，阿尔巴尼亚庆祝自法西斯侵略者铁蹄下获得解放和建立人民民主国家的四周年纪念。这一天又是阿尔巴尼亚一九一二年宣布独立的三十六周年纪念日。阿尔巴尼亚人民以重大的成就来纪念他们历史上的这两座里程碑。在短短的时期内，他们已超过战前的生产水平，建筑了一万幢房屋，修复了战时被破坏的一切桥梁、修建了新的公路和两条铁路，并完成了大规模的开荒工作。在土地改革中，阿尔巴尼亚农民获得了三十二万公顷的可耕土地。四年内有十万九千文盲学会了读书和写字。全国初等学校、中等学校和专科以上学校的学生总数达十万八千人（全国人口为一百万左右），超过战前数字。阿尔巴尼亚报纸发行总数也增加三倍半。星罗棋布的文化室网已经建立，对人民的医药服务也大见改进。
    【新华社陕北三日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：最近曾访问过阿尔巴尼亚的苏联作家爱伦堡，值此阿尔巴尼亚从法西斯占领之下解放四周年纪念之际，特撰文向阿尔巴尼亚人民热烈祝贺。爱伦堡写道：“四年前，世界发现了一个新的国家——阿尔巴尼亚。在此以前，人人都只知道一个有着意大利资本与美国代理人的国度。四年以前，世界看到这个国度已经生活着英勇与骄傲的人民。世界发现了阿尔巴尼亚，因为阿尔巴尼亚发现了她自己——她自己的意志、道路和心灵。阿尔巴尼亚的诞生，不是受华盛顿的命令，也不是由于伦敦的愿望。她是在战火中、在阵痛里、在游击队的斗争中诞生的。在这些岁月里，苏维埃人民在远离阿尔巴尼亚的地方从事生死之战，他们在伏尔加河、在聂斯德河消灭着阿尔巴尼亚人民的敌人。今天庆祝的四周年纪念，对我们说也同样是一个大节日。我们曾帮助世界发现阿尔巴尼亚，帮助阿尔巴尼亚发现她自己，我们可以此骄傲。没有渺小的国家，也没有渺小的人民。人类心灵的伟大是不能用数字来衡量的。现在，我们看到老大的英国狮子抱怨着阿尔巴尼亚。有着这类敌人的民族是伟大的民族。今天，我回想到你们那使人惊异的国家，它的丛山小径、蜿蜒的大路、古老的城池、它的英勇、欢快、禀赋甚厚的人民。我现在用我心灵的眼睛看到了阿尔巴尼亚人为自由而牺牲的殉难地——戴蒂山。我再说一句：祝贺你——鹰之国！祝贺你们——阿尔巴尼亚友人们！你们的自由万岁！我们的友谊万岁！”
    【新华社陕北四日电】塔斯社讯：苏联消息报撰文评论独立与民主的阿尔巴尼亚建国四周年称：阿尔巴尼亚的人民民主政权，实行了最重要的政治、社会和经济改革，完全解脱了外国帝国主义的统治，并且为阿国走向社会主义创造了先决条件。阿国经济的发展现已达到战前的水平。煤和石油的生产已超过了战前，电力的生产则较战前增加了三倍。阿国有史以来第一次提出了意义重大的问题——建设能满足经济发展之需要及人民要求的现代化工业。土地改革以后，三分之二的农村人口，计五十二万七千人得到了利益，耕地面积和收成现已超过战前。在保皇法西斯政权统治下，阿国人民几乎全体都是文盲。而现在，国内已几乎全部完成了七年制的普遍强迫教育。学校和学生的数目较一九三八年增加了三倍。阿国有史以来第一次开设了高等学校——大学、师范学院、农业研究院、音乐学校和艺术学校。阿国妇女已从家庭和国家的奴役束缚下解放出来，奋起参加政治和文化的生活。有一千一百名人民议会的议员是妇女，有七千五百余妇女已在政府、公共机关及工业部门中担负要职。帝国主义阵营的威胁和挑衅都没有能动摇民主的阿尔巴尼亚，阿尔巴尼亚人民从整个民主阵营、首先是苏联人民的支持和帮助中吸取了力量和信心。
