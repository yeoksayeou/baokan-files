　　Lingzheng Canal Holds Representative Meeting
  　Implement People-Run Improved Management
    [North Yue News] The Lingzheng Canal in the Fourth District of North Yue, in order to earnestly implement people-run and improved canal management, specially convened a representative meeting of thirty-one beneficiary villages on the eighth of this month. Eighteen new standing committee members were democratically elected to organize a general association. Eight experienced old cadres in canal project management were hired to continue helping the new standing committee grasp this work. At the same time, a winter and spring project plan was drafted, as well as a draft for water management conventions. The main reasons why the canal was not managed well in the past, after discussion in the group meetings of the assembly, were considered to be: First, the plan was too large and the water volume was insufficient, failing to meet requirements, causing the middle and lower reaches to lose confidence. Second, there were shortcomings in implementing the principle of people-run with government assistance. The cadres of the general association were not selected from the masses of the beneficiary villages, but were appointed by the government. In organizational management, a contradiction formed between the general association and the masses of the beneficiary villages. The masses believed that the Lingzheng Canal belonged to the public, so they were unwilling to work or bear water fees, and they concealed the number of irrigated mu, resulting in unfair burdens and difficulty in apportioning water fees. When problems occurred in the canal, they could not be fully and promptly resolved, affecting organizational management and project progress.
    Regarding how to earnestly implement people-run and specific management of the canal in the future, the following decisions were made after discussion at the meeting: (1) Based on this year's water volume, it was determined that the goal for next year is to irrigate the existing 47,000 mu of land in twenty-one villages well, and no further expansion will be made downward. (2) Re-register land mu and investigate undeclared land; the construction costs for the cleared undeclared land will be paid up within five years. (3) Formulate and adopt new water usage conventions to strengthen water usage management. Canal openings cannot be made casually without the approval of the standing committee. (4) The beneficiary villages will elect standing committee members to organize the Lingzheng Canal General Association and manage their own water conservancy undertakings. Strengthen the connection between the general association and the village branches to overcome the past antagonism. (5) Determine unified water delivery and irrigation, unified burdens, and appropriate adjustments to water volume for saline-alkali land based on the pre- and post-seedling stages to give appropriate consideration. Winter and spring project costs will be apportioned equally based on the newly registered number of land mu. (6) For villages in the lower reaches that have paid construction fees but have not benefited due to insufficient water volume, it was decided that the fees already paid would be returned in installments based on the current beneficiary villages' ability to bear the burden over the years.

　　灵正渠召开代表会议
  　贯彻民办改进管理
    【北岳讯】北岳四分区灵正渠，为认真贯彻民办和改进渠道管理，特于本月八日召集三十一个受益村代表大会，民主选出十八个新常委组织总会，并在旧干部中聘请了八个对渠道工程管理有经验的继续帮助新常委掌握这一工作。同时拟定了今冬明春工程计划，及使水管理公约等草案。过去该渠未能办好的主要原因，经大会小组会讨论认为原因是：一、计划庞大水量不足，不能达到要求，使中下游失去信心。二、执行民办公助方针有缺点，总会的干部不是从受益村群众中选出来的，而是政府委派的；在组织管理上形成总会与受益村群众的对立，群众认为灵正渠是公家的，所以既不愿做工与负担水费，又不爱护渠道，灌溉亩数互相匿报，形成负担不公平，水费不易摊派。使渠道发生了问题不能全部及时的解决，影响组织管理与工程进行。
    今后如何认真贯彻民办和具体管理渠道等问题，经大会讨论，作了如下决定：（一）根据今年水量，确定明年以浇好原有二十一个村四七○○○亩土地为目的，不再向下扩大。（二）重新登记地亩，清查黑地；对清理出之黑地在五年内将建筑费补齐。（三）制定与通过新的使水公约，加强使水管理，干支渠未经常委会批准不能随便开口。（四）由受益村选常委组织灵正渠总会，自己管理自己的水利事业。加强总会与村分会的联系，克服过去对立现象。（五）确定统一输灌使水，统一负担，对盐碱地按苗前后可以调剂水量，适当照顾。今冬明春工程费用，按新登记地亩数平均摊派。（六）对下游已出建筑费，但因水量不足，致未能受益之村庄，其已出费用决定按现受益村历年负担能力确定分期归还。
