Ten Thousand Miles of Battles Along the Great Wall Line
(V) Leading Fu Zuoyi by the Nose

While our troops on the Rehe front were clearing out enemy satellite strongholds around Chengde, a unit of the People's Liberation Army thrust across the Pinggu Road, launching a disruptive war between Huairou and Miyun, cutting off the enemy's transportation line for reinforcements to Rehe! This blow hit the enemy's vital point, greatly alarming Fu Zuoyi. He hastily ordered the 92nd Army, which was originally defending the Pinggu Road and had been transferred north to relieve Chengde, to turn back. He also urgently dispatched the main force of the 94th Army, the Provisional 3rd Army, and the Cavalry 4th Division, totaling three armies and eight divisions, 60,000 men, along with all his air force, to advance towards the Pinggu area from Miyun, Shunyi, and Sanhe in three routes. The blindly advancing enemy was courageously and proactively held back by one of our columns. After six days of intense fighting, Fu’s illusion of encircling and annihilating our army completely failed!

On June 4th and 5th, Fu’s bandits approached us, and on the 5th, they sent six airplanes to assist in the battle. This group of bandit minions blindly circled for a day without figuring out exactly where we were!

On the 6th, the daredevil An Chunshan (commander of the enemy's Provisional 3rd Army), relying on the large number of troops behind him and the support of more than a dozen airplanes, ordered his troops in four columns to launch six consecutive fierce attacks on our Pinggu front and rear Wenying positions. Our brave fighters stubbornly resisted, especially the warriors of the 3rd Battalion of "40" unit, who relied on hastily built simple fortifications, using pre-arranged fire nets and courageous counterattacks to stop the bandits' attacks. Fu's bandits mobilized four mountain guns, two howitzers, and numerous machine guns to fiercely fire on a section of our position, paying a great price to occupy a forward outpost of ours for surveillance. At a section of the position, our two companies repelled the attack of a regiment of Fu's bandits. On the main defense line, our regiment repelled the fierce attack of the enemy's main force, the New 31st Division. The bandits were so flustered that they forgot to pull the fuse when throwing hand grenades. The soldiers picked up the grenades and happily said, "We need this!" Then they threw them back at the enemy. Under the cover of strong artillery fire and more than a dozen airplanes, Fu's bandits carried out wave-like group charges, but they were all crushed. Our army's position stood firm like the Great Wall, while Fu's bandits suffered at least eight or nine hundred casualties.

On this day, the bandits' ambitions were indeed not small. The rear echelon continued to increase, wanting to seize us for another battle the next day. However, we calmly retreated that night. The bandits, not knowing the true situation and being too timid, abandoned the corpses and retreated more than ten miles, throwing flares all night to embolden themselves.

On the 7th, it rained heavily, and the airplanes did not come to assist. The bandits huddled and did not move. Our army was only a little more than ten miles away from them, resting peacefully.

On the 8th, Fu's bandits brought out all the air force they could use, daring to invade the empty city of Pinggu only under the cover of day-long bombing and strafing. Advancing into the liberated area with their buttocks exposed, Fu Zuoyi probably realized that the situation was not very good. The next day, he hastily withdrew most of his forces back to the Pinggu line, leaving only a small part trapped in the empty city of Pinggu, and on the dawn of the 13th, they withdrew from Pinggu in a panic.

After six days and nights of blocking and twisting, although we were a little tired, we were victorious. Because we used only a part of our force to lead this clumsy ox by the nose, not only causing greater fatigue and consumption to Fu’s 60,000 main force, but more importantly, we bought time and powerfully cooperated with the major victory around Chengde.

(VI) The Ping-Sui Railway is Broken to Pieces

The Ping-Sui Railway is Fu’s main artery. Fu relies on it to squeeze the blood and sweat of the people of Chahar and Suiyuan, replenishing his depleted troop and food resources to make a dying struggle.

This spring, our army advanced into southern Chahar, eastern and southern Suiyuan, liberating vast areas, cutting off the middle section of the Ping-Sui Railway, and occupying Tianzhen, Yanggao, Julebao, Zhoushizhuang, and Fengzhen, the gateway to eastern Suiyuan. After that, Fu’s bandits could only use automobiles to connect with Jining via Chaigoubu and Xinghe.

In the summer, Fu’s main force was dragged to eastern Hebei by us, and our army in northern Chahar took the opportunity to liberate Longguan, Chicheng, and other places, making the Ping-Sui Railway inflexible.

In mid-September, the self-proclaimed clever Fu’s bandits thought that after our troops had fought for seven thousand miles, they would inevitably pass the Ping-Sui Railway to southern Chahar for rest and reorganization. Therefore, he placed the 16th Army, the 35th Army, the Provisional 3rd Army, and the Provisional 4th Army all along the Nankou to Zhangjiakou line, and the 94th Army on the Mentougou and Yangfang line in western Beijing, attempting to block and intercept our army. However, Fu's bandit's fantasy was shattered because our army did not pass the Ping-Sui Railway at all. Our army continued to be active in the triangular area between the Ping-Sui and Ping-Gu lines, posing a great threat to Fu's bandits, making their main force restless day and night, unable to get a moment's rest. However, our army took the opportunity to liberate Wuqing, Sanhe, and Xianghe in eastern Hebei, and the enemy was again transferred to this area by our army.

Fu’s bandits attempted to use the method of "roaming and suppressing to control the area" to eliminate the threat posed by our army to the Ping-Sui and Ping-Gu lines, but this trick failed again. Fu’s bandits once used the 16th Army and the Provisional 3rd Army as "roaming and suppressing" troops. Our army adopted a strategy of resisting step by step, luring the enemy to the mountainous area of the Great Wall along Sihaibao and Bohai Township, making it impossible for them to move within a few days. At this time, another unit of our army suddenly appeared in the empty old nest of Fu’s bandits in Suiyuan, successively capturing five cities including Fengzhen, Jining, Helin, Liangcheng, and Qingshui. American news agencies exclaimed that this was a "strangulation offensive." Fu Zuoyi was flustered at this time, and again ordered the 16th Army and the Provisional 3rd Army to flee back from the Great Wall overnight, and urgently dispatched three cavalry brigades and parts of the 35th Army and the Provisional 4th Army to relieve the siege of Suiyuan.

In early November, these Fu's bandits who reinforced Suiyuan had just arrived in Jining when Zhangjiakou became tight again. Our army successively liberated Qingyuan, Chongli, Shangyi and other cities in northern Chahar, and captured Zhaochuanbao northeast of Xuanhua and Jiajiawan and Shuangyinbao thirty miles northeast of Xuanhua, annihilating two regiments of Fu’s Provisional 31st Division. A unit of our army was even more active in places more than ten miles north of Zhangjiakou, greatly shocking Zhang Xuan. Fu’s bandits thought we were attacking Zhang Xuan, and hurriedly pulled back the troops reinforcing Suiyuan to guard Zhangjiakou. However, our army cut off the eastern section of the Ping-Sui Railway (i.e., the Ping-Zhang section), occupied Shacheng, Tumu, Xinbaoan, Qinglongqiao, Badaling and other stations and key points, controlled 150 miles of railway, and closed the road from Beiping to Chahar and Suiyuan. At this time, Fu's bandits hurriedly transferred the only main force, the 94th Army, on the Ping-Bao line to Nankou, and sent the main force of the 35th Army to Kangzhuang.

When Fu’s bandits concentrated their main force on the Ping-Zhang section, the empty Suiyuan was subjected to a sweep by our army on the western front, isolating the city of Gui Sui.

The Ping-Sui Railway has been broken to pieces, leaving only a very few isolated white dots such as Zhangyuan, Datong, and Guisui. Whenever our army wants to eat it, we can eat it.

　　万里征战长城线
    （五）牵着傅作义的鼻子走
    当热河前线我军正在扫清承德外围敌卫星据点的时候，解放军一部，横插平古路，在怀柔、密云间展开破击战，切断了敌人增援热河的交通线！这一拳头打中了敌人的要害，可把傅作义急坏了，于是慌手慌脚，命令原守平古路现北调图解承德之围的九二军回头，并急调九四军，暂三军主力及骑四师总计三个军八个师六万人，加上他全部的空军，分由密云、顺义、三河三路向平谷地区冒进。盲目的敌人，被我某纵队英勇主动的扭住了，整整六天的战斗，傅匪企图围歼我军的幻想，是完全失败了！
    六月四、五两日傅匪逼近了我们，五日又用六架飞机前来助战，这群匪喽罗，瞎糊转了一天，也没有弄清我到底在什么地方！
    六日冒失鬼安春山（敌暂三军军长）自恃后边部队多，天上又有十几架飞机助战，叫部队四路纵队向我平谷前后温营阵地发动连续六次的猛扑，我英勇战士顽强阻击，特别是“四○”部三营的勇士，他们依靠匆忙修筑的简单工事用预先按排好的火网和勇猛的反突击，阻止了匪徒们的攻击。傅匪调集了四门山炮，两门榴弹炮和众多的机枪，向我某段阵地猛烈射击，付出了极大代价才占领了我一处警戒性的前沿工事。某段阵地我两个连击退了傅匪一个团的进攻。在主要的防线上，我一个团击退了傅匪主力新三十一师的猛扑。匪徒们是这样的慌张，以致掷投手榴弹忘记了拉导火线，战士们拾到手榴弹高兴的说：“我们正需要这个呢！”于是又将它投向敌人。傅匪在强大炮火和十几架飞机掩护助战下，实行波浪式的集团冲锋，但都被粉碎了，我军阵地如长城一样的屹立不动，而傅匪伤亡则至少是八九百。
    这天匪徒们的野心确是不小，后梯队源源增来，想抓住我们第二天再战，但是晚上我们从容转移了。匪徒们一来不知虚实，二来胆子太小，他们抛弃尸体，倒退十几里，整夜投掷照明弹以壮胆。
    七日，大雨滂沱，飞机没出动助战，匪徒们蜷缩不动。我军也只离他们十里多地安然的休息了。
    八日，傅匪拿出了可以动用的全部空军，竟日轰炸扫射掩护下，才敢于侵占平谷空城。亮着屁股冒进解放区，傅作义大概发现情势并不很妙，第二天便仓惶把大部兵力撤回平古线，仅留一部困守平谷空城，十三日拂晓又狼狈撤出平谷。
    经过六昼夜的阻击扭击，我们虽也有点疲劳，但我们胜利了。因为我们仅以一部分兵力牵住了这笨牛的鼻子，不仅给傅匪六万主力以更大的疲劳，众多的消耗；而重要的是我们争取了时间，有力配合了承德外围重大的胜利。
    （六）平绥路支离破碎了
    平绥路是傅匪大动脉，傅匪依靠它榨取察绥人民的血汗，补充其枯竭的兵源粮源，以做垂死的挣扎。
    今春我军挺进察南、绥东、绥南，解放广大地区，斩断平绥中段，占领天镇、阳高、聚乐堡、周士庄和绥东门户丰镇。此后，傅匪只能用汽车由柴沟堡经兴和与集宁联系。
    夏天，傅匪主力被我拖到冀东，察北我军乘机解放了龙关、赤城等地，使平绥路变成动转不灵。
    九月中，自作聪明的傅匪，以为我们这支部队转战七千里后，必然要过平绥路到察南休整，因此他把十六军、三十五军、暂三军、暂四军，全放在南口至张家口一线，把九十四军放在平西门头沟、羊坊一线，企图堵击我军。可是傅匪的幻梦破灭了，因为我军根本就不过平绥路，我军继续活跃于平绥、平古两线间的三角地区，予傅匪极大威胁，使其主力昼夜不安，无法得到片刻休息，我军却在冀东相机解放了武清、三河、香河，敌人又被我军调到这个地区了。
    傅匪企图用“游剿控制面”的办法，解除我军对平绥平古两线的威胁，可是这一手又失败了。傅匪曾以十六军、暂三军作为“游剿”部队，我军采取节节抗击，诱敌至四海、勃海所长城线的山区里，使其几天之内不能转动。此时我另一支部队，突然出现于空虚的傅匪老窝绥远，连克丰镇、集宁、和林、凉城、清水等五城，美国的通讯社惊呼这是“绞杀性的进攻”。傅作义这时手忙脚乱，又令十六军、暂三军星夜从长城沿线窜回，急派三个骑兵旅与三十五军、暂四军一部去解绥远之围。
    十一月初，这些增援绥远的傅匪，刚到集宁，张家口却又吃紧，我军连续解放了察北的清源、崇礼、尚义等城，攻克宣化东北之赵川堡及宣化东北三十里的贾家湾、双印堡，歼傅匪暂三十一师两个团。我军一部更活跃于张家口北十余里的地方，使张宣大为震动。傅匪以为我攻张宣，急将增绥远的部队拉回，看守张家口。但我军却斩断了平绥东段（即平张段），占领沙城、土木、新保安、青龙桥、八达岭等车站及要点，控制了铁路一百五十里，关闭了北平通往察绥的道路。此时傅匪又急忙抽调平保线唯一的主力九十四军到南口，派三十五军主力到康庄。
    傅匪集中主力于平张段时，空虚的绥远，则遭受西线我军扫荡，孤立了归绥城。
    平绥路已经支离破碎了，只剩下张垣、大同、归绥等极少数孤立白点子了，我军想什么时候吃掉它，就可以什么时候吃掉它。
