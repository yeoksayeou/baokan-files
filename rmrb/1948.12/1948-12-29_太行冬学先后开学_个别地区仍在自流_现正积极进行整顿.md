　　Taihang Winter Schools Open One After Another
  　Individual Areas Still Operating Informally
  　Active Rectification Underway
    [Report from this newspaper] Winter schools in various parts of Taihang mostly opened in November, with Shexian County being the most widespread. For example, in Longhu Village, Third District, more than 400 people participated in winter school. Four small civil schools specifically teaching literacy to young people were also established according to street, with 77 young men and 81 young women. In Houchi Village, Sixth District, seven winter schools were established, totaling 287 people. Twenty-seven mothers with nursing babies also voluntarily attended classes. Dongbei Village in Licheng County has established a newspaper reading group and two youth literacy classes. The youth literacy class in Yudi Village, Zanhuang County, also quickly increased from 24 to 35 people. Dongbei Village in the First District of Licheng County overcame the past formalistic approach of emphasizing large-scale concentration, adopting a method of centralized leadership and decentralized learning, with each group concentrating on exchanging experiences every ten days, which everyone found very convenient. In Beiguokou Village, Third District, Shexian County, the main cadres of the village formed a study group, and before each class, they first discussed the content of the newspaper in conjunction with the work in the village, and decided on the teaching content, overcoming the shortcomings of the low level of volunteer teachers, no classes to teach, and the winter school being reduced to an "office." The branch secretary, militia captain, and civil education director also participated in cultural learning, playing an active leading role. Houchi Village, Sixth District, used the "Winter School Weekly" to encourage and commend the good on the one hand, and to collect mass opinions in order to improve on the other, all of which achieved great results.

    However, in individual counties, there is still insufficient attention paid to winter schools, causing them to fall into a state of informal operation. Some cadres believe that they can complete the task without running winter schools, emphasizing that "this winter's work is busy, there are many tasks, and winter schools cannot be run well." They regard winter schools as an obstacle to the central task. Some cadres feel that since the masses must be conscious and voluntary, then only those who want to come can come; those who don't want to come don't have to come. They completely fail to think of positive solutions. Or they only regard winter schools as simple literacy education. Regarding the above incorrect views, the Fifth and Sixth Prefectural Offices pointed out at the county education section chiefs' meeting that winter schools are a place for in-depth ideological and cultural education of the masses, with the purpose of raising the ideological awareness of the masses and ensuring the completion of the central task. The consciousness and voluntariness of the masses does not mean that there is no need for leadership, organization, and discipline. Mutual criticism among the masses cannot be said to be an administrative order. The Propaganda Department of the First District Committee also clearly instructed: This year's winter school movement is a major issue of raising the masses a step further politically and ideologically. First of all, we must oppose the cadres' ideological view of underestimating winter schools. The county party committee propaganda minister and the county head must personally help and guide, and must not, as in the past, leave it to a few education cadres to do. At present, the winter school committees of various counties and villages are actively rectifying.

### 太行冬学先后开学　个别地区仍在自流　现正积极进行整顿

　　太行冬学先后开学
  　个别地区仍在自流
  　现正积极进行整顿
    【本报讯】太行各地冬学大部于十一月间先后开学，尤以涉县为最普遍。如三区龙虎村有四百余人参加冬学。还按街成立了四个专教青年识字的小民校，计有男青年七十七人，女青年八十一人。六区后池村成立起七处冬学，共二百八十七人，有二十七个奶孩子的，也自愿跟着上课。黎城董北村已成立起一个读报组，两个青补班。赞皇榆底村青补班也由二十四人很快增加为三十五人。黎城一区董北村克服了过去强调大集中的形式主义，采取集中领导，分散学习，每十天各小组集中交换经验的办法，大家觉得很方便。涉县三区北郭口村由村里主要干部成立学习小组，于上课前一日，根据报纸结合村中工作，首先进行讨论，决定教课内容，克服了义务教员程度低，没课上，把冬学降为“事务所”的缺点。支书、民兵队长、民教主任等也都参加文化学习，起了积极带头作用。六区后池村用“冬学周报”一面鼓励表扬好的，一面搜集群众意见，以求改进，都收到很大成效。
    但个别县份，仍有对冬学重视不够，使冬学陷于自流的现象。有些干部认为不搞冬学也能完成任务，强调“今年冬季工作忙，任务多，冬学办不好”。把冬学看成对中心工作有妨碍。有的干部觉得既要群众自觉自愿，那就只好谁想来就来；不想来就不来。完全不去想积极的解决办法。或只把冬学看成简单的识字教育。对于以上不正确观点，五、六专署在各县教育科长会议上指出：冬学是对群众进行深入的思想教育与文化教育的场所，目的是提高群众思想觉悟，保证中心工作完成。要群众的自觉自愿，不等于不要领导，不要组织和纪律。群众间的互相批评不能说是行政命令。一地委宣传部也明确指示：今年的冬学运动，是从政治上思想上把群众提高一步的大问题。首先必须反对干部思想上轻视冬学的观点。县委宣传部长、县长必须亲自动手帮助和指导，不能仍如过去交给少数教育干部去作。现在各县、村冬学委员会正积极整顿中。
