Strengthen Party Propaganda Work
    Ji Zhong Eleventh Prefectural Committee Convenes Propaganda Meeting
    [This newspaper reports] The Propaganda Department of the Ji Zhong Eleventh Prefectural Committee convened a propaganda meeting last month to examine the leadership of branch education and cadre study. In the reports, various regions have achieved the following results: 1. In cadre study: Most counties have begun to pay attention, establishing cadre study groups and establishing a system of two hours of study per day. Comrade Liu Xu, Secretary of the Shen County Party Committee, personally leads, supervises, and inspects the cadre study in various agencies, and includes cadre study as one of the daily reporting items. Ningjin emphasizes the combination of study between worker-peasant cadres and intellectuals. Wuqiang Ninth District formulated a literacy chart for cadres with low cultural levels. When cadres go to the countryside to work, they are required to learn two characters every day. Ningjin conducted a policy study test for cadres when deploying work for the three winter months. 2. In branch education, in the 27 villages in the Fourteenth District of Shen County, 12 village branches that did not have propaganda committee members have added branch instructors, and six villages can persist in studying once every seven days. (Whether they can consistently persist? Worth studying - Editor)
    From the review, the following shortcomings can be seen: (1) In implementing the instructions and resolutions of the higher Party Committee Propaganda Department, some counties have experienced the phenomenon of not studying and not implementing. For example, Zhao County and Luancheng did not convey and deploy the instructions of the Prefectural Committee Propaganda Department on cadre study. When the Shen County Party Committee Propaganda Department conveyed the District Party Committee Propaganda Department's instructions on propaganda and education work for the three winter months, the County Committee did not study them based on the actual conditions of the county, but simply reprinted and distributed them. (2) Work is only conveyed and deployed, without inspection and supervision, which is a relatively common phenomenon, thus making it impossible for the Party Committee's instructions to be realized on schedule. (3) There is an erroneous view of underestimating propaganda in the guiding ideology. (4) Only focusing on central work, neglecting the combination with departmental work. Some propaganda department cadres in some counties have been working in key villages for a long time, and do not understand the overall propaganda and education work, and there is no normal system for departmental work.
    Based on the above review, the Prefectural Committee put forward the following opinions: 1. Under the unified leadership of the Party Committee, strengthen future propaganda and education work. 2. Establish a departmental work system. The Propaganda Department should provide effective guidance for the central tasks of each period. It is stipulated that the County Party Committee must summarize and report to the Prefectural Committee once a month, and report on special topics once every half month (except in special circumstances). The propaganda departments of various counties that are not sound should be supplemented with full staff. 3. Strengthen the leadership of cadre study, improve the political and theoretical cultural level of cadres, clarify the purpose of study, and improve work efficiency. 4. Strengthen rural branch education, overcome the backward selfishness, coercion, commandism, lack of discipline, and anarchic phenomena existing in the thinking of party members. The County Party Committee publishes small pamphlets for branches; village branches should add propaganda committee members (if there are no literate people, branch instructors can be added) and establish a study system.

### 加强党的宣教工作　冀中十一地委召开宣教会议

　　加强党的宣教工作
    冀中十一地委召开宣教会议
    【本报讯】冀中十一地委宣传部于上月召开宣教会议，检查支部教育和干部学习的领导问题，在汇报中，各地有以下成绩：一、在干部学习上：大部县份已提起注意，建立干部学习小组，树立每天两小时的学习制度。深县县委书记刘旭同志，亲自领导督促检查各机关干部学习，并把干部学习列为日常汇报工作项目之一。宁晋强调工农干部与知识分子结合学习。武强九区对文化水平低的干部，制定认字表。干部下乡工作时，规定每天学习两个字。宁晋在布置冬三月工作时，曾进行干部政策学习测验。二、在支部教育上，深县十四区二十七个村里，有十二村支部没有宣委的都添上了支部教员，有六个村能坚持七天一次学习。（是否能经常坚持？值得研究——编者）
    从检讨中可以看出还有如下缺点：（一）在执行上级党委宣传部指示与决议上，有的县发生不研究不执行的现象。如赵县栾城对地委宣传部关于干部学习的指示：没有向下作传达布置。深县县委宣传部，在向下贯彻区党委宣传部冬三月宣教工作指示时，县委会没有根据本县情况研究，就原封翻印，发了下去。（二）工作只传达布置，不检查督促，这是比较一般的现象，因此使党委指示不能按期实现。（三）在领导思想上存在着轻视宣传的错误观点。（四）只忙中心工作，忽视与部门工作结合。有的县宣传部干部，长期作重点村工作，对全面的宣教工作却不了解情况，对部门的业务也没有正常的制度。
    根据以上检讨，地委提出如下意见：一、在党委的统一领导下，加强今后的宣教工作。二、树立部门工作制度，对每个时期的中心任务，宣传部要作有效的指导。规定县委向地委每月要总结报告一次，半月专题汇报一次（特殊情况例外）。各县宣传部门不健全的要补充满员。三、加强干部学习领导，提高干部的政治理论文化水平，明确学习目的，提高工作效率。四、加强农村支部教育，克服党员思想上存在的落后自私，强迫命令无纪律无政府的现象。县委出版支部小服；村支部要添设宣委（如没识字的可添支部教员），树立学习制度。
