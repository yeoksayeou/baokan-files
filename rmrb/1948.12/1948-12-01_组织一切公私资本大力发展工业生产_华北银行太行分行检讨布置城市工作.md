　　【Taihang Dispatch】The Taihang Branch of the North China Bank convened an urban work conference on October 16th. The meeting involved an exchange of past urban work experiences, a liquidation of purely economic viewpoints and blindness in work, as well as bureaucratic work styles. It clarified the urban work guidelines and policies and operational issues. Regarding achievements: From February to September of this year, according to statistics from twelve units, a total of 28.19 billion yuan was absorbed in deposits, of which deposits from public enterprises accounted for 80%. At the same time, 19.017 billion yuan was issued, which helped the development of urban industry and commerce and united private industry and commerce. It also provided a material basis for regulating prices and stabilizing finance. In terms of remittance work, according to statistics from seven units, more than 9.98128 billion yuan was remitted out and 8.2477 billion yuan was remitted in during the half-year period, promoting the exchange of materials, adjusting market chips, and carrying out anti-counterfeit money and anti-silver smuggling struggles. However, the shortcomings were also very serious: First, there was a relief mentality. Understanding of the policy of prospering the economy and developing production was not clear enough. The focus of urban loans was once placed on the poor, and some even relied on deposits to solve the livelihood difficulties of poor peasants. In terms of interest rates, the interest rate was determined according to the size of the loan, which invisibly played a role in encouraging decentralized loans. This limited the organization of social idle funds, creating the impression among the masses that those who could get loans were "glorious in poverty," while no one deposited money for fear of gaining a reputation for being rich. Second, there was blindness in work. Some cadres mistakenly understood that loan support for industrial and commercial development was simply to help industrialists and businessmen make money. They did not distinguish between industry and commerce, and did not distinguish between public and private in industry and commerce, resulting in helping the exploitation of merchants, which opened the door for speculative merchants to take advantage of loopholes. Some people counted banknotes every day, satisfied with the busyness of their work, but did not know what the income and expenditure were for. Some comrades could not find interest in their work, showed indifference, and their attitude towards depositors and borrowers was "Jiang Taigong fishing, those who are willing will take the bait," without establishing the basic attitude of a new democratic economic worker. As for studying economic work, it was even more out of the question. Some people regarded depositors and borrowers as "troubles," and did not actively approach them. Wu'an rejected dozens of depositors, who put their money in private banks, blurring the leading position of the national economy. Regarding the future urban banking work guidelines and specific tasks, it is stipulated as: "Adjusting finance, stabilizing prices, and supporting the restoration and development of industry, handicrafts, and commerce that is beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood." The first is to strengthen business activities and vigorously develop deposit business, using fixed-term, current, and savings (current overdraft) methods to organize all public and private enterprises, institutions, and individual idle funds, and then use them to support the development of industry and commerce. This is the key to carrying out business. To strengthen social activities, it is necessary to be good at contacting people from all walks of life and learn how to treat people; at the same time, it is necessary to appropriately increase interest rates and reward long-term deposits. Strengthen lending business, using fixed-term loans (current overdraft), mortgage loans, and bill discounting methods to achieve the purpose of supporting production and stabilizing prices. And overcome the phenomenon of responding to every request, with the main focus on issuing loans to industry and handicrafts. For loans with large amounts and long periods, the method of lending the whole amount and repaying in installments can be adopted. In addition, fixed-order long-term mortgage loans can be used to help warehouse work. Secondly, short-term commercial loans should be handled to support specialized shops that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, and to assist cooperatives with correct business orientations. Third, through remittance business, adjust the chips in various places to achieve the purpose of stabilizing prices and developing production. Fourth, strengthen the management of the urban financial market and manage private banks and money shops. Adjust the chips in a planned manner, carry out anti-counterfeit money struggles and anti-silver smuggling struggles. This is a regular task. In order to complete the above tasks, it is necessary to conduct systematic investigation and research, do a good job in economic intelligence work, and regularly study the issue of fund allocation. The meeting also revised the interest rate regulations and deployed winter work.

　　组织一切公私资本大力发展工业生产
    华北银行太行分行检讨布置城市工作
    【太行电】华北银行太行分行于十月十六日召开城市工作会议。交流以往城市工作经验，清算单纯经济观点与工作上的盲目性，以及官僚主义作风等；明确了城市工作方针政策与业务经营诸问题。在成绩方面：从今年二月至九月，据十二个单位统计，共吸收存款二百八十一亿九千多万元。其中公营企业存款占百分之八十。同时发放了一百九十亿零一千七百余万元，帮助了城市工商业发展，团结了私营工商业。在调剂物价稳定金融上，也有了物质基础。汇兑工作上，据七个单位统计，半年中汇出九十九亿八千一百二十八万余元，汇入八十二亿四千七百余万元，促进了物资交流，调整了市场筹码，并进行了反假票和反白银走私斗争。但是缺点也很严重：第一、是救济观点。对繁荣经济发展生产这个方针了解的不够明确，曾把城市贷款重点放在贫民身上，甚至还有依靠存款来解决贫农生活困难的。在利息上则根据贷款额大小规定利息高低，无形中起了奖励分散贷款的作用。限制了社会游资的组织，造成群众认为能贷上款的是“穷光荣”，而无人存款，怕落富名。第二、是工作上的盲目性。不知道贷款的作用是在于平稳物价，稳定市场，有些干部把贷款扶持工商业发展错误的了解为单纯的帮助工商业者赚钱，对工商不分，对工商中的公私不分，结果帮助了商人的剥削，以致给投机商人开了钻空的门子。有些人天天数票子，满足于业务上的繁忙，不知道收入和支出是为了什么。有些同志在工作中找不到兴趣，表现冷淡，对存贷户的态度是“姜太公钓鱼，愿来者上钩”，未树立新民主主义经济工作者的起码态度。至于学习经济工作，则更谈不上。有的人对存贷户看成是“麻烦”，不主动和他们接近。武安把几十户存款户都顶出，人家放到私人银号去，模糊了国家经济的领导地位。关于今后城市银行工作方针和具体任务，规定为：“调剂金融，平稳物价，扶持工业手工业及有益于国计民生的商业的恢复与发展”，首先是加强业务活动，大力开展存款业务，运用定期、活期、储蓄（活存透支）等方式，把一切公私企业、机关、个人的游资组织起来，再用于扶助工商业的发展，这是开展业务的关键。要加强社会活动，就要善于和各方面人进行接触，学会待人接物；同时要适当的提高利息，奖励长期存款。加强放款业务，运用定期放款（活存透支）、抵押放款、票据贴现等方式，达到扶持生产，平稳物价的目的。并克服有求必应的现象，以发放给工业手工业为主。对数目较大时间较长的贷款，可采取整贷零还办法。此外并可用定货作长期抵押贷款，帮助仓库工作。其次是办理短期的商业贷款，扶植有利于国计民生的专业行店，及扶助业务方向正确的合作社。第三、经过汇兑业务，调剂各地筹码，达到稳定物价发展生产的目的。第四、加强城市金融市场的管理工作，管理私人银钱业。有计划地调剂筹码，进行反假票斗争和反白银走私斗争，这是一个经常工作。为了完成上述任务，必须有系统的进行调查研究，做好经济情报工作，经常研究资金调拨问题。会上并修改了利息规定，布置了冬季工作。
