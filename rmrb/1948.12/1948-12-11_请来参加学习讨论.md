    Please Come and Participate in Learning Discussions
    In the "Learning and Discussion" column on page four of this newspaper on December 8th, readers have already raised five questions: 1. Why should we study the history of social development first? 2. What are the weaknesses of small producers? 3. What is rural-style bureaucracy? 4. What is an empirical learning style? 5. How to read the newspaper, etc. It is hoped that comrades in various regions and organizations will actively answer based on their learning and practical experience. Various problems discovered in learning in various regions should also be raised quickly to encourage everyone to discuss.

    请来参加学习讨论
    本月八日本报四版“学习讨论”栏中，读者已提出五个问题：一、为什么要先学社会发展史？二、小生产者的弱点是什么？三、什么是农村式官僚主义？四、什么是经验主义学习方式？五、怎么读报等。希望各地各机关同志根据自己的学习所得和切身体验踊跃作答。各地学习中发现的各种问题也希赶快提出来，发动大家讨论。
