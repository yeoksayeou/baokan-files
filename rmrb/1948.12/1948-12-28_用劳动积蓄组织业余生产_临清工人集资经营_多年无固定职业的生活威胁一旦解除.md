　　Using Labor Savings to Organize Amateur Production
  　Linqing Workers Pool Funds to Operate
    Ending the Threat of Years of Unstable Employment
    [Report from our newspaper] Reporter Tian Liu reports: Under the leadership of the Linqing City Trade Union, workers have achieved great success in saving, organizing production, and establishing households. The city has more than 5,000 workers. Apart from less than half of them who are shop assistants and factory workers, the occupations of other workers are very irregular and their income is uncertain. For example, there are eight or nine hundred "dabache" (a type of handcart used for transporting goods at the Linqing docks) workers in the city. They rely solely on physical strength to transport goods for merchants. When it is windy or rainy and business is poor, they have to go hungry. Shoe workers rely on piecework for shoe stores. If the shoe stores don't order goods, they also have to go hungry. The same goes for other workers such as those working on bridges, ferries, barbershops, bathhouses, and fertilizer workers. Based on these characteristics of the city, the City Federation of Trade Unions launched an appeal in May of the year before last to organize cooperative shops and workshops to solve the workers' living and employment difficulties. At that time, the workers pooled shares to establish the Lihua Shoe Store, etc., and jointly operated the Yihua Iron Factory with private individuals. By the end of last year, the profits had more than doubled. The Dabache Sixth Branch has a total of fifty-four workers. Starting in July of the year before last, they launched a savings campaign to save whole amounts rather than odd bits, in order to accumulate capital for production (in the past, the workers would pool the wages earned by all workers in one day, and then divide it equally among each person to take care of those who had poor business that day). In the first month, they accumulated 320 yuan (new currency, same below), and selected one person to engage in a small business, selling fodder at the Haiyan Exchange. The manager did not start a fire (meaning he didn't draw a salary), and like others, received a share of the labor money every day. In one and a half months, they earned 2,100 yuan. In September, they expanded their business and opened a Tongyi Freight Yard. Because they took good care of the merchants and the fodder was cheaper than elsewhere, business was very good, and they earned 10,000 yuan by the end of the year. Last spring, they raised another 5,000 yuan in shares and earned ten times that amount within a year. Each person received 1,000 yuan, and there was still a lot of remaining fodder and six large mules, which are still used as the fund for the freight yard's operation this year. More than 500 shoe workers have organized a production cooperative to make military shoes since the city's liberation (September 1, 1945). In the past three years, they have made 160,000 pairs, earning wages of more than 1.3 million catties of rice. They distributed dividends twice last August and this October, totaling more than 300,000 catties. Other examples include the bathhouse operated cooperatively by bathhouse workers, the Lizhong Grain Store jointly operated by barbers, and the mat shop of the Dabache Fifth Branch workers, all of which are very developed. According to the responsible comrades of the City Federation of Trade Unions, there are eight cooperatives, freight yards, and factories operated by workers in the city, and according to the statistics at the beginning of this year, the funds have reached 400,000 yuan. This year is not yet the time for settlement, but according to what is known, they generally earn dividends of two or three times or more.

　　用劳动积蓄组织业余生产
  　临清工人集资经营
    多年无固定职业的生活威胁一旦解除
    【本报讯】记者田流报导：临清工人在市工会领导下，节约储蓄，组织生产，建立家务，已获巨大成绩。该市有五千多工人，除为数不及一半的店员和工厂工人外，其他工人的职业很不经常，收入也没一定。如大把车（是临清码头运输货物的一种手推车，轮大车高）工人，全市有八九百，是光凭力气代客商运输的，遇到刮风下雨，生意不好就得饿肚；鞋业工人则专靠给鞋店作包工为生，鞋店一不订货，也得饿饭；其他如桥渡、理发、澡塘、肥料等工人，也大都如此。市职工会根据本市这些特点，在前年五月号召组织合作性的商店作坊，以解决工人的生活困难和职业困难，当时工人们集股成立了利华鞋店等，并与私人合营了一个益华铁工厂。到去年年底，获利润一倍半以上。大把车六分会共有五十四个工人，前年七月份起，开展分整不分零的节约储蓄运动，以积累资本进行生产（该业工人过去就是将全体工人一日所得的工资，集中起来每人平均分一份，以照顾当天生意不好的人），第一个月积了三百二十元，（新币，下同）选出一个人来，搞了个小买卖，在海盐交易所卖草料。经理人不起火，和别人一样每天分一份角力钱，一个半月，就赚了二千一百元。九月就扩充营业，开了个同益货栈，因为他们对来往客商照顾周到，草料也比别处贱，生意很好，到年底获利万元。去年春又集股五千元，一年内获利十倍。每个人分了一千元，还余有很多草料和六匹大骡子，仍作为该栈今年经营的基金。五百余鞋业工人从该市解放时（一九四五年九月一日）起，就组织起生产合作社作军鞋，三年来已作十六万双，得工资米一百三十余万斤。去年八月和今年十月各分红一次，共三十余万斤。其他如澡塘工人合作经营的澡塘，及理发工人合营的利众粮店，大把车五分会工人的席麻店等，都很发达。据市工会负责同志谈：全市有八个工人经营的合作社、货栈和工厂，今年初统计：资金已达四十万元。今年还不到结帐时期，据了解的，一般都获二、三倍以上的红利。
