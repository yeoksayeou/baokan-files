　　Liberation of Tangshan
　　The People's Liberation Army fought well, the Tangshan mining area is liberated. The Tangshan coal mine is not simple, let me tell you about it:

　　This mine is really large in scale, second only to Fushun in our country. Coal is mined entirely by machines, and the machines are all brand new. The monthly output of coal is tens of thousands of tons, which not only supplies Tianjin and Beiping, but also Shanghai and Nanjing rely on it. After our army liberated Tangshan, not only would Tianjin and Beiping have no coal to burn, but Beijing, Shanghai, and Wuhan would be in even greater trouble!

　　Speaking of Tangshan, Tangshan is really not simple, the population totals 200,000, and workers account for 50,000 to 60,000. In addition to coal mines, there are cotton mills, running water, electricity and telephones are complete. The scale of the power plant is really large, and the daily power generation is inexhaustible. In addition, there are railway factories that can build carriages and repair locomotives. Losing Tangshan worries the bandit Fu, who originally wanted to destroy it before running away, but didn't expect the People's Liberation Army to advance so quickly, he had to abandon it and flee for his life.

　　解放唐山
    解放军打得好，唐山矿区解放了。唐山煤矿不简单，听我给你说一番：
    这矿规模真是大，我国除了抚顺就数它，挖煤全部用机器，机器都是崭新的，月产煤炭好几十万吨，除了供给平津用，上海南京也依靠它。我军解放唐山后，不但平津没煤烧，京沪武汉更不得了！
    说唐山，道唐山，唐山真是不简单，人口共有二十万，工人就占五六万。除了煤矿有纱厂，自来水电灯电话都齐全。发电厂的规模真是大，每天发电用不完。此外还有铁路工厂，能造车厢修理火车头。丢了唐山傅匪愁，本想加以破坏他再溜，不想解放军进得快，只得丢下把命逃。
