Captured enemy army commander Wang Zejun
Bitterly narrates how Chiang Kai-shek annexed the miscellaneous troops

Wang Zejun, the lieutenant general and army commander of the 44th Army of the Kuomintang, son of Wang Zanxu, deputy director of the Kuomintang Chongqing Appeasement Office, after being captured, tragically recounted to the People's Liberation Army the history of how his troops were slaughtered, annexed, and finally eliminated by the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary group. Wang said: The 44th Army originally belonged to the 29th Army Group of the Sichuan Army. When the army group left Sichuan during the Anti-Japanese War, it still had the strength of 24 regiments, organized into two armies, with his father Wang Zanxu as the commander-in-chief. Later, the designation of the army group was canceled by Chiang Kai-shek, leaving only the 44th Army, with four divisions under its jurisdiction. After repeated reductions and mergers, only six incomplete regiments remained. This time, he was pursued by the People's Liberation Army and fled west from Haizhou, attempting to approach Huang Baitao's corps to seek temporary safety, but was instead placed by Huang Baitao at the forefront outside Nianzhuangwei. During the battle, the entire army was wiped out by us, and Wang himself was suppressed under the collapsed shelter by the fierce artillery fire of the People's Liberation Army until the end of the battle, when the People's Liberation Army dug him out of the mud. He said: "Look at our weapons! I'm afraid even if they are handed over to your army, you wouldn't want them. Others have already replaced their equipment with American weapons several times, but the guns of the 44th Army are still the Hanyang-made of the 29th year of the Republic. We have a total of twelve mountain guns. Except for one that has been lost and one that has been damaged, there are still ten, but not a single shell is issued, and finally they are all handed over to Huang Baitao. In this operation, we were not given bullets, medicines, or food. From the 16th, we had not eaten a grain of rice for several days, and the horse meat was also finished. The wounded soldiers were left everywhere. At 4:20 pm on the 18th, when we were attacked by your army, we asked to withdraw the troops to Nianzhuangli, but Huang Baitao resolutely refused, and instead ordered the entire 44th Army to "succeed or die." On the night of the 8th, when we were pursued by your army and fled from east to west, Huang Baitao's corps headquarters and hundreds of thousands of troops from four armies rushed across the Yunhe River bridge, set up machine guns, and did not allow anyone else to pass. At that time, my army was almost crushed. I was so anxious that I had to shout: "The 44th Army, follow me!" Fortunately, I managed to get them across the bridge. This time, my soldiers were scattered by your army and ran towards Nianzhuangwei. Huang Baitao not only refused to open the door, but also opened fire. "Wang regretted not listening to the People's Liberation Army's order to surrender, sighed, and couldn't help but shed tears. Wang Zejun is now forty-eight years old, from Xichong, Sichuan. He has served as a platoon, company, battalion commander, acting regiment commander, and regiment commander in the Sichuan Army. After the Sichuan Army was reorganized by Chiang Kai-shek in the 27th year of the Republic, he successively served as the commander of the 149th Division of the 21st Army, the deputy commander of the 44th Army, and the army commander.

    被俘敌军长王泽浚
    惨述蒋匪吞并杂牌军
    【新华社淮海前线九日电】国民党重庆绥署副主任王缵绪之子，国民党军四十四军中将军长王泽浚被俘后，向解放军凄惨地叙述他的部队遭受蒋介石反动集团宰割吞并直到最后被消灭的历史。王说：四十四军原属川军第二十九集团军，该集团军在抗日战争中出川时尚有二十四个团的兵力，编为两个军，由其父王缵绪任总司令。后来该集团军番号被蒋介石取消，只剩下一个四十四军，辖四个师。又经一再裁并，只剩下残破不全的六个团。他这次被解放军追击由海州西逃，企图靠拢黄伯韬兵团求得暂时的保命，结果反被黄伯韬摆在碾庄圩外的头阵。战斗中该军被我全部歼灭，王本人则被解放军猛烈的炮火压在摧垮了的掩蔽部下，直到战斗结束后才被解放军把他从泥土中扒了出来。他说：“看看我们的武器吧！恐怕缴给贵军也不会要的。别人已经换过好几次美械装备了，四十四军的枪支一直到现在还是民国二十九年的汉阳造。我们，一共有十二门山炮除一门已经丢掉，一门打坏外，还有十门，但是不发给一个炮弹，最后又全部缴给黄伯韬。这次作战中，不发给我们子弹、药品、粮食，我们从十六日起，几天粒米未进，马肉也吃完了，伤兵丢得到处都是。到十八日下午四时二十分，我被贵军攻击时，我们要求把队伍撤到碾庄里，黄伯韬坚决拒绝，反而下令要四十四军全体“不成功便成仁”。八日夜，我们被贵军追击由东向西逃奔时，黄伯韬的兵团部和四个军十几万人马抢过运河桥，把机关枪架着，不准别人过，当时我这个军几乎被挤垮了，急得我只有大喊：“四十四军跟我来！”总算被我喊着过了桥。这次我的兵被贵军打散了，跑向碾庄圩，黄伯韬不但不开门，反而开枪射击。王后悔未听解放军劝降的命令，长叹了一声，不禁簌簌地落下泪来。按王泽浚现年四十八岁，四川西充人，曾任川军排、连、营长、代团长、团长，民国二十七年川军被蒋介石改编后，历任二十一军一四九师师长、四十四军副军长、军长。
