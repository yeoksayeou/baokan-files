Xinhua News Agency Editorial

　　The governments of the North China, Shandong, Jin-Sui, and Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Liberated Areas recently consulted and decided to establish the People's Bank of China, issuing the new currency of the People's Bank of China on the 1st of this month. It is stipulated that one yuan of the new currency is equivalent to one hundred yuan of Ji'nan currency or Beihai currency, one thousand yuan of Jin-Cha-Ji border currency, and two thousand yuan of Northwest Agricultural currency. The new currency has begun to be issued, first circulating in the North China, Shandong, and Northwest Liberated Areas, and gradually extending to other Liberated Areas. After the issuance of the new currency by the People's Bank, the old currencies of the above-mentioned Liberated Areas will be discontinued and gradually withdrawn. In this way, the currency unification work of the three major Liberated Areas of North China, Shandong, and Northwest will be gradually completed. The issuance of the new currency by the People's Bank heralds the further consolidation of the currency of the Liberated Areas and the further prosperity of the Liberated Areas' economy.

　　At present, most of the currencies in the Liberated Areas were produced during the War of Resistance Against Japan, under conditions of enemy division and blockade. At that time, the economies of the Liberated Areas could not be interconnected, so it was impossible and unnecessary to issue a unified currency. After the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the governments of the Liberated Areas began to carry out currency unification work. For example, the Central China Liberated Area issued a unified Central China currency to recover five or six different local currencies with different values. Other Liberated Areas also took similar measures. However, before the unification work was completed, the Kuomintang reactionaries launched a civil war, and many areas of the Liberated Areas were occupied by the enemy, forcing this unification work to stop. Last year, the North China Liberated Areas held a financial and economic work conference, and everyone felt the necessity of quickly unifying the currencies of the Liberated Areas. Especially after the People's Liberation Army's victorious counter-offensive, the situation in the Liberated Areas north of the Longhai Railway was consolidated and gradually became a unified area. Trade links and material exchanges between regions are developing rapidly. However, the lack of currency unification and the instability of currency parities have become a huge obstacle to trade development and have caused great difficulties for the operations of the field army. Therefore, the currency unification work of the Liberated Areas has become urgent.

　　In January of this year, the Northwest Liberated Area stopped the issuance of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Bank currency, making the Northwest Farmers Bank currency the unified currency of the Northwest Liberated Area (including the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia and Jin-Sui Border Regions). In April, the two major Liberated Areas of Jin-Cha-Ji and Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu merged into the North China Liberated Area. Thus, the Jin-Cha-Ji border currency in the north and the Ji'nan currency in the south were simultaneously announced to be mutually convertible at a ratio of ten to one. On October 5, the Beihai currency of Shandong and the two currencies of North China were announced to be mutually convertible, stipulating that the Beihai currency was equivalent to the Ji'nan currency, and the ratio to the Jin-Cha-Ji border currency was also set at one to ten. On October 20, the Northwest Agricultural currency and the North China currency were announced to be mutually convertible, stipulating that one yuan of Ji'nan currency was equivalent to twenty yuan of Northwest Agricultural currency, and one yuan of Jin-Cha-Ji border currency was equivalent to two yuan of Northwest Agricultural currency. On November 15, the Beihai currency and the Central China currency were announced to be equally convertible. In this way, the currency of the three major Liberated Areas of North China, East China, and Northwest has completed the initial unification work. In addition to these three major Liberated Areas, there are also the newly issued Zhongzhou currency in the Central Plains Liberated Area, and the Northeast currency in the Northeast Liberated Area, and the Great Wall currency in the Ji-Cha-Re-Liao Border Region has not yet been unified. After the liberation of Zhengzhou and Kaifeng, the Central Plains Liberated Area has completely merged with the North China Liberated Area, and the currency unification of the two regions is necessary and possible to be realized in a short period of time. The currency unification work between the Northeast Liberated Area and the Liberated Areas inside the pass will have to wait until the liberation of Peiping and Tianjin and the smooth transportation inside and outside the pass.

　　Fixed exchange rates and mutual convertibility are only the first step in the currency unification work. Due to the complex variety of currencies, the different currency values, and the considerable trouble in mutual conversion, the people of the Liberated Areas demand the issuance of a unified new currency to replace these various old currencies. Therefore, the governments of the North China, Shandong, and Northwest Liberated Areas negotiated and decided to merge the North China Bank, the Beihai Bank, and the Northwest Farmers Bank into the People's Bank of China, and issue new currency by the People's Bank as the unified currency of the three major Liberated Areas. Also, because the old currencies in various places have too low a value and are inconvenient to calculate, it was decided to appropriately increase the value of the new currency, which is one hundred times higher than the Ji'nan currency, Beihai currency, and Central China currency, in order to reduce difficulties in trade.

　　The currency unification work of the Liberated Areas has no similarity with Chiang Kai-shek's so-called "currency reform." Chiang Kai-shek's so-called "currency reform" aims to implement more drastic inflation and use it to more cruelly plunder the people. Therefore, the result of its implementation is not only soaring prices and popular resentment, but also accelerated economic collapse. Our currency unification is to make our currency system simpler and more solid; to facilitate material exchange and economic development; and is entirely based on the interests of the people. Therefore, it can be predicted that the issuance of the new currency will promote a more unified and prosperous market in the Liberated Areas.

　　The currency of the Liberated Areas, from the first day it was produced, was completely detached from gold and silver. The people of the Liberated Areas do not love gold and silver. What we love is grain, cloth, cotton, and other means of subsistence and means of production. Therefore, although the Liberated Areas have rich gold mines, producing hundreds of thousands of taels of gold annually, and possess large amounts of silver and silver coins; what we use as a currency guarantee is not gold and silver, but more reliable grain, cloth, cotton, and other important materials necessary for production and life. Any people holding the currency of the Liberated Areas can fully obtain various means of subsistence they need at any time and in any market. We neither need price limits nor will there be panic buying. Therefore, the currency value and material value of the Liberated Areas are far more stable than in the Kuomintang-controlled areas. When Japan surrendered, one yuan of Beihai currency was only equivalent to five yuan of Chiang Kai-shek currency (legal tender), and one yuan of Ji'nan currency was only equivalent to two yuan of Chiang Kai-shek currency (legal tender). When Chiang Kai-shek announced the "currency reform" in August this year, due to the sharp drop of Chiang Kai-shek's currency, the above two currencies had risen to the value of eight hundred to one thousand yuan of Chiang Kai-shek currency (legal tender), and now it is worth more than ten thousand yuan. When the bogus "Gold Yuan Certificate" was first issued, each yuan was worth about three thousand yuan of Beihai currency and Ji'nan currency, but now only three months later, it has fallen to below three hundred yuan, and in some areas it has fallen to around one hundred yuan. These obvious facts have not only educated the people of the Liberated Areas, but also educated the people in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, making them hate Chiang Kai-shek currency and cherish the currency of the Liberated Areas. Our currency of the Liberated Areas is rapidly expanding its circulation range in coordination with the victory of the war and will drive Chiang Kai-shek's currency into its grave.

### 中国人民银行发行新币

　　中国人民银行发行新币
    华北、山东、晋绥、陕甘宁各解放区政府最近协商决定成立中国人民银行，于本月一日发行中国人民银行新币，并规定新币一元合冀南币或北海币一百元，合晋察冀边币一千元，合西北农币二千元。新币已开始发行，首先在华北、山东、西北各解放区流通，逐渐推及其他解放区。人民银行新币发行后，上述各解放区旧币均将停止发行，并逐步收回。这样，华北、山东、西北三大解放区货币统一工作，即将逐渐完成。人民银行新货币的发行，预告着解放区货币的进一步的巩固，和解放区经济的进一步的繁荣。
    现在各解放区的货币，大多是在抗战时期，被敌人分割封锁情况之下产生的。当时各解放区经济上均不能互相联系，因此不可能、亦不需要发行统一的货币。抗战胜利以后，各解放区政府开始作货币统一工作，如华中解放区发行了统一的华中币，来收回五六种名称不同而且币值不同的地方货币，其它各解放区也作了类似的措施。但是统一工作尚未完成时，国民党反动派发动内战，解放区有许多地方被敌人侵占，使这个统一工作不得不停顿下来。去年华北各解放区召开财政经济工作会议，大家均感到有迅速统一各解放区货币的必要。尤其在人民解放军胜利反攻以后，陇海路以北各解放区局面巩固，而且逐渐打成一片；各地区间贸易联系，物资交流日益发展起来。但各地货币的不统一，货币比价的不固定，成为贸易发展中的巨大障碍，并使野战军的作战遇到巨大的困难。因此，解放区的货币统一工作，已经刻不容缓。
    今年一月，西北解放区停止了陕甘宁边区银行货币的发行，使西北农民银行货币成为西北解放区（包括陕甘宁和晋绥两个边区）的统一货币。四月，晋察冀和晋冀鲁豫两大解放区合并为华北解放区，于是北面的晋察冀边币和南面的冀南币，即于同时宣布以十比一的比价互相通用。到十月五日，山东的北海币与华北的两种货币宣布互相通用，规定北海币与冀南币等价，与晋察冀边币的比价亦定为一比十。十月二十日，西北农币与华北货币宣布互相通用，规定冀南币一元合西北农币廿元，晋察冀边币一元合西北农币二元。十一月十五日，北海币与华中币又宣布等价通用。这样，华北、华东、西北三大解放区的货币，便完成了初步的统一工作。除这三大解放区外，现在还有中原解放区新发行的中州币，和东北解放区的东北币，冀察热辽边区的长城币尚未统一，中原解放区在郑汴解放以后，已与华北解放区完全打成一片，两区货币的统一已有在短时期间实现的必要和可能；东北解放区与关内解放区的货币统一工作，则须在平津解放，关内外交通畅通以后。
    固定比价，互相通用，这只是货币统一工作的第一步。由于各种货币种类复杂，币值高低不一，互相折算仍然相当麻烦。各解放区人民要求发行统一的新货币，来代替这各式各样的旧货币。因此华北、山东和西北各解放区政府协商决定，把华北银行、北海银行、西北农民银行合并改组为中国人民银行，并由人民银行发行新币，作为三大解放区的统一货币。又因各地旧币币值太低，计算不便，故决定把新币的币值适当提高，比冀南币、北海币、华中币提高了一百倍，借以减少贸易上的困难。
    解放区的货币统一工作，与蒋匪所谓“改革币制”丝毫没有类似之点。蒋匪的所谓“改革币制”，目的是为实行更剧烈的通货膨胀，并以此来更残酷地掠夺人民。所以实行结果，不但物价飞涨，民怨沸腾，而且更加速了经济崩溃。我们的货币统一，是为了使我们的货币制度更简单，更巩固；是为了更便利于物资交流和经济发展；完全是从人民的利益出发的。因此可以预料新币的发行，必将促成各解放区市场的更统一，更繁荣。
    解放区的货币，从它产生的第一天开始，即与金银完全脱离关系。解放区的人民并不爱好金银，我们爱好的是粮食，布棉以及其它生活资料与生产资料。所以解放区虽然有着丰富的金矿，年产黄金数十万两，并拥有大量的白银和银币；但我们用作货币保证的，却不是金银，而是比金银更可靠的粮食，布棉，以及其他为生产和生活所必需的重要物资。持有解放区货币的任何人民，他可以在任何时期，任何市场，充分获得他们所需要的各种生活资料。我们既不需要限价，更不会发生抢购。所以解放区的币值物值，比较国民党统治区远为稳定。在日本投降时候，北海币一元仅合蒋币（法币）五元，冀南币一元仅合蒋币（法币）二元，到今年八月蒋匪宣布“改革币制”的时候，由于蒋币的狂跌，上述两种货币已经涨到值蒋币（法币）八百元至一千元，现在则值万元以上。在伪“金圆券”初发行时，每元折合北海币和冀南币约三千元，现在仅仅三个多月，已经跌到三百元以下，有些地区已经跌到百元上下。这些明显的事实，不但教育了解放区的人民，而且也教育了国民党统治区的人民，使他们痛恨蒋币爱护解放区的货币。我们解放区的货币正在配合着战争的胜利，迅速扩张它的流通范围，并将把蒋币驱逐到它的坟墓里去。
