    Gasperi Government—Gasperi is the head of the Italian Christian Democratic Party (which represents the interests of reactionary landlords and capitalists in Italy). During the coalition cabinets of 1946 and February 1947, Gasperi served as Prime Minister. He engaged in reactionary activities and did not adopt the democratic construction plans proposed by the Italian Communist Party and the Socialist Party. After obtaining a $100 million loan from American imperialism, he became even more reactionary, openly excluding the Italian Communist Party and the Socialist Party. By May 1947, the reactionary Gasperi simply organized a one-party dictatorial government. This purely reactionary government was later called the Gasperi Government. Its reactionary nature is manifested in: extending the time of the American occupation forces' stay in Italy, allowing American imperialism to turn the Apennine Peninsula into a military base for the American expansion policy, abolishing all restrictions that could hinder the free actions of American imperialist capital in Italy, maintaining the original serf system in the south, attempting to abolish the democratic rights won by the working people, and plotting to assassinate Comrade Togliatti, the leader of the Italian Communist Party. In short, the Gasperi government is as reactionary as the Chiang Kai-shek dictatorial government in China, and it is the enemy of the broad masses of the Italian people.

    加斯贝利政府——加斯贝利是意大利的基督教民主党的头子（该党是代表意大利反动地主及资本家的利益的）。在一九四六年与一九四七年二月的联合内阁时期中，加斯贝利任内阁总理。进行反动活动，不采纳意大利共产党及社会党提出的民主建设方案。自得了美帝国主义的一亿美元贷款后，更加反动，对意共及社会党公开予以排斥，到一九四七年五月时，反动的加斯贝利就干脆组织了一党包办的独裁政府。后来称这个清一色的反动政府为加斯贝利政府。其反动表现在：延长美占领军驻意的时间，允许美帝国主义变亚平宁半岛为美国扩张政策的屯兵场，取缔了足以妨碍美帝国主义资本在意的自由行动的一切限制，在南部保持原来的农奴制度，并打算取消劳动人民所争得的民主权利，及阴谋杀害意大利共产党领袖托格里亚蒂同志。总之，加斯贝利政府与中国的蒋介石独裁政府是同样的反动，它是意大利广大人民的敌人。
