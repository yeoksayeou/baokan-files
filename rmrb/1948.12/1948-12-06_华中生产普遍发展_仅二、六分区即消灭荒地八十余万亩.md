Xinhua News Agency, East China, 4th. With the active support of the democratic government, production has generally developed in various parts of Central China this year. The Second District (administering Xinghua, Baoding, Jiangdu, and five other counties), the Sixth District (administering Suqian, Guanyun, Donghai, Lianshui, and eight other counties), and the Ninth District (administering Nantong, Haiqi, and four other counties) in Central China distributed a total of 600 million Central China currency (hereinafter the same) in agricultural tools, seeds, and fertilizer loans this spring, along with 870,000 catties of grain for seeds, and 40,000 catties of soybean cakes, helping farmers solve some of the difficulties in production materials. As a result, the Second and Sixth Districts were able to eliminate a total of 840,000 mu of wasteland. In the Fifth District (administering Yeting, Funing, Anyang, Huaian, and nine other counties), 10,400 farmer households in Binhai County (newly established county, south of Guanyun) were able to plant 355,000 mu of land, which previously lacked seeds, because they obtained loans of more than 96,700 catties of corn seeds, eliminating 99% of the cultivated wasteland. In terms of cotton cultivation, the First District (administering Rugao, Taixing, Taixian, Dongtai, and seven other counties) distributed a total of 110 million yuan in cotton seed loans and 3,500 dan (each dan being 100 jin) of seed cotton this spring, solving the cotton seed problem for 50,000 mu of cotton fields (accounting for one-sixth of the cotton fields in the entire reclamation area). The district also distributed 240 million yuan in weeding loans in the summer, enabling 50,000 mu of cotton fields to complete summer weeding smoothly, avoiding crop failure. Among them, the northern cotton reclamation area of Dongtai received loans of more than 13.8 million yuan and 200 dan of ginned cotton, enabling 2,000 farmer households to plant cotton, which also promoted the local textile industry. This year, the area wove more than 20,000 bolts of cloth, earning a gross profit of 240 million yuan, which can solve the living expenses of 10,000 people for one month. Sheyang County (newly established county, eastern Baoying) in the Fifth District distributed 15,000 shi (each shi being 100 jin) of grain loans for digging canals to open up a cotton transport river, which increased cotton production by 7,000 dan along the river this autumn. In the spring and summer, the First and Fifth Districts distributed more than 240 million yuan in fishing loans, 2,000 dan of salt, 600 dan of ginned cotton, and 400 dan of corn in the fishing ports of Haigang, Lusi, Beikan, Xinyang, Old Yellow River, and Shuangyang, enabling fishermen in each port to quickly resume production after suffering severe looting and destruction by Kuomintang bandit troops. According to statistics from five villages in Haigang, 29 fishing boats caught more than 326,000 jin of fish during the summer rainy season (about ten days per season), which can be exchanged for more than 4,000 dan of grain.

　　华中生产普遍发展
  　仅二、六分区即消灭荒地八十余万亩
    【新华社华东四日电】在民主政府积极扶助下，今年华中各地普遍发展了生产。华中二分区（辖兴化、宝定、江都等五县）、六分区（辖宿迁、灌云、东海、涟水等八县）和九分区（辖南通、海启等四县），今春共发放农具、种子、肥料等贷款华中币（下同）六亿元，种子贷粮八十七万斤，豆饼四万斤，帮助农民解决了部分生产资料的困难。二、六分区因此得以消灭荒地共达八十四万亩。五分区（辖叶挺、阜宁、安阳、淮安等九县）滨海县（新设县，灌云南）一万零四百户农民，因为贷得玉米种九万六千七百余斤，种上了原来缺乏种子的三十五万五千余亩地，消灭了熟荒百分之九十九。棉垦业方面，一分区（辖如皋、泰兴、泰县、东台等七县）今春共发放棉种贷款一亿一千万元，籽花三千五百担（每担一百市斤），解决了五万亩棉田（占全垦区棉田的六分之一）的棉种问题。该区在夏季又发放锄草贷款二亿四千万元，使五万亩棉田顺利完成夏锄，免致歉收。其中东台北部棉垦区共得贷款一千三百八十余万元，皮花二百担，使二千户农民种上了棉花，并因此推动了该地的纺织业。该地今年共织布二万余匹，获毛利二亿四千万元，可解决一万个人一个月的生活费用。五分区射阳县（新设县，宝应东部）发放开河贷粮一万五千石（每石一百市斤）开凿运棉河，使今秋该河沿岸增产棉花七千担。一、五分区春夏两季在海港、吕四、北坎、新洋、旧黄河、双洋等渔港发放渔贷二亿四千余万元，盐二千担，皮花六百担，玉米四百担，使各港渔民在遭受国民党匪军严重的抢劫破坏后，能迅速恢复生产。据海港五个村统计，二十九条渔船在夏季雨汛中（每汛十天左右），即捕鱼三十二万六千余斤，可换粮食四千余担。
