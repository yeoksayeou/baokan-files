　　Baruch Plan
　　——Baruch was the United States representative to the United Nations Atomic Energy Control Commission. The reactionary plan for international control of atomic energy he proposed was later called the Baruch Plan. The content of this reactionary plan: to establish a committee that would not only have full power to control the manufacture and storage of atomic bombs in all countries, but also consider the use of atomic energy for industrial production to be illegal, and to abolish the veto power in the committee. Vyshinsky criticized the plan, saying: "This is a conspiracy by American imperialism to interfere in the national economies of other countries; it is a measure by American imperialism to prevent control from being extended to the United States, while all other countries must immediately submit to international control; it is a measure by American imperialism to achieve permanent domination in the field of atomic energy."
　　Little General Assembly
　　——This refers to the illegal "Interim Committee on Peace and Security." At the United Nations General Assembly last September, American imperialism brazenly proposed the establishment of a so-called "Interim Committee on Peace and Security" under the United Nations General Assembly, attempting to replace the work of the Security Council with it. This illegal organization does not exercise the veto power, abolishes the principle of unanimity among the great powers, and replaces it with a two-thirds majority vote, thereby transforming the United Nations organization into a tool for anti-democratic forces to carry out expansion and world hegemony. The Soviet Union has always opposed this illegal organization that violates the United Nations Charter and undermines the United Nations organization. Although the United States and its puppet countries passed this illegal organization on November 6 last year, the Soviet Union and the new democratic countries, which uphold peace and democracy, finally refused to participate.

    巴鲁区计划
    ——巴鲁区是联合国原子能管制委员会的美国代表。他提出的国际管制原子能的反动计划，后来都称为巴鲁区计划。这个反动计划的内容：设立一个委员会，不仅有全权管制一切国家的原子弹的制造与保藏，而且认为原子能为工业生产之用也为违法，并在该委员会中取消否决权。维辛斯基曾批评该计划说：“这是美帝国主义干涉它国的国民经济的阴谋；这是美帝国主义在阻止把管制引伸到美国身上去，而其他一切国家却要立即服从国际管制；这是美帝国主义在原子能领域中的永久统治权的措施。”
    小型联大
    ——就是非法的“和平安全临时委员会”。在去年九月联合国大会时，美帝国主义竟狂妄地提出在联合国大会下成立一个所谓“和平安全临时委员会”，图以此代替安理会的工作。这个非法组织，不行使否决权，废除大国一致原则，而以三分之二多数表决代替之，更从而变联合国机构为其反对民主势力和肆行扩张与称霸世界的工具。苏联一直反对这种违反联合国宪章，破坏联合国机构的非法组织，虽然去年十一月六日美帝国主义为首及其喽罗国通过了这个非法组织，但维护和平民主的苏联及新民主国家终于拒绝参加。
