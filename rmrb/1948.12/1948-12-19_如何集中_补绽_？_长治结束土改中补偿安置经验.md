In the conclusion of land reform, how to centrally "mend the gaps" by conducting compensation, resettlement, and adjustments is a rather complex issue. The following are the working steps taken by the first batch of villages in Changzhi to complete land reform in resolving supplemental source issues:

(1) Public Land, Temple Land, and Leftover Harvest Issues: On this issue, generally, a branch committee meeting and a people's representative meeting are held first to discuss what leftover harvests exist in the village. After generally clarifying this, a mass meeting is convened for democratic discussion, with self-reporting and mutual reporting by everyone to find them. For example, in Gaohe, after the announcement was made at the mass meeting, the masses immediately pointed out that 200 yuan in silver dollars had not been found. The cadres immediately made a self-criticism, saying they had forgotten (not necessarily truly forgotten, but they had to admit it when questioned by the masses). After the inspection, the masses were all happy and said: This is truly thorough democracy! Comprehensive analysis of various villages reveals three general situations: first, remaining harvests that have not been distributed; second, harvests lent to the masses; and third, harvests that have become public property or entered cooperatives. Next, study how to handle these harvests. If they have entered cooperatives, withdraw the items without affecting the principles of the cooperative. If there is an impact, they can be valued and returned to the cooperative. If they have become public property, withdraw them. The handling of remaining undistributed harvests is more complex. The main issue here is the property of middle peasants wrongly struggled against. In some places, the undistributed property of middle peasants was also sold and then compensated. The middle peasants are dissatisfied, feeling that they were wrongly struggled against, their property was sold, and now they are being compensated. On this issue, many cadres are ideologically resistant and unwilling to return the original items. Some say: "Is it the case that if it was distributed, the original item is not returned, but if it was not distributed, the original item is returned? Will this affect other middle peasants?" We should educate the cadres and masses to handle this differently, explaining that returning undistributed items satisfies the middle peasants and does not affect the poor and hired peasants. Doing so can unite the majority. If undistributed harvests are also sold and then compensated, it is tantamount to admitting that the past tendency in land reform was correct, which is not in line with policy. If the already distributed items are also to be returned, it will inevitably affect the poor and hired peasants, and in fact, it is difficult to achieve. Other methods must be used for compensation.

(2) How to Handle the Issue of Party Members and Cadres Returning Excessively Distributed Harvests: For this issue, the main reliance is on educating branch members, conducting criticism and self-criticism, overcoming the privileged thinking of Party members, explaining the standards for returning harvests, ensuring they are not lower than the level of ordinary liberated masses, and dispelling the real fear of not knowing how much to return. For example, Nanshan Village guided Party members to discuss why the masses were dissatisfied with the cadres. The result of the study was that the main reasons were excessive occupation of harvests and poor work style. This made the Party members aware of the need to return excessively occupied harvests. After the ideological breakthrough, self-reporting was conducted, and everyone discussed how much should be returned and what should be returned. From the self-reporting, three types of thinking developed among Party members: (1) To show off, some Party members, who did not receive much or too much, returned a lot. (2) A small number of Party members clearly received too much but were unwilling to return it. (3) Some were willing to return, but not the good stuff. At this time, criticism should be guided, and everyone should publicly discuss what should be returned, make a resolution, and then convene a meeting of non-Party cadres and a people's representative meeting to proceed in the same way. Then, Party members and cadres should self-report and make self-criticisms at agricultural association group meetings, citizen group meetings, and mass meetings, allowing the masses to express their opinions. This initially improves the relationship between cadres and the masses, laying the foundation for the next step of Party rectification.

After carrying out the above, Party members consciously improve, and the masses are generally satisfied. In addition, some villages have individual Party members who are not adequately enlightened and are simply pressured with organizational discipline. A Party member in Gaohe said angrily: "Return it then!" Zhang Mingxian, a Party member in Nandong, said: "My excess distribution was discussed by the branch! I won't return it." Forcing the return of harvests in this way, even though the harvests are returned, the Party members have no awareness and are full of complaints. Even more, in branch meetings, no criticism and self-criticism are carried out, and some are returned casually. The results of this are not good.

(3) The Issue of Middle Peasants Voluntarily Giving Up Land: Under normal circumstances, middle peasants are initially unsure of the situation. Some households want to give up land, but after publicizing the policy and explaining that the land of middle peasants will not be touched, if they are willing to help others, it must be truly voluntary. As a result, some no longer want to give up land. Thus, from fearing and "voluntarily" giving up land to truly grasping the policy of voluntariness, our publicity work has achieved results. Generally, accepting middle peasants' voluntary land goes through five steps: (1) self-reporting; (2) holding family meetings for discussion; (3) the people's representative meeting and the masses gauge their thoughts, what their motives are, and whether they are truly voluntary; (4) allowing them to repeatedly reverse their decision several times, until they are truly voluntary.

The correct approach is to enlighten mutual assistance and mutual aid consciousness, and commend the mutual assistance spirit of land-giving households, improving mass awareness from the positive aspect. For example, in Cang'erhe, after clarifying the policy, Jia Fuyou reported that he wanted to give up land. He said: "I have long wanted to take out some land to help them (referring to the struggle targets), but I was afraid that the cadres would say I was 'pitying the targets.' This time, the superiors have called for correcting this deviation, and I am willing to take out three and a half mu of land." Li Haoguo, a middle peasant in Qinggang, took out two mu of land, saying: "Let everyone be able to live!" These sincerely voluntary actions have been commended. In Gaohe, someone took out land, and the masses said they were afraid it was not truly voluntary. He anxiously said: "I really can't take out my heart and show you!" The People's Representative Conference told these voluntary land households, on the one hand, gauging their thoughts, and on the other hand, telling them that if they were unwilling, they could take it back again!

In addition, some villages do not adhere to the principle of voluntariness enough, and have some task-oriented views. They verbally publicize that they will not move the land of middle peasants, but in reality, they are hard-mobilizing middle peasants to give up land. For example, Baihou said this in their publicity: "You have few people and can't do well, your wages are high and your burden is heavy..." It is a violation of the spirit of the policy to mobilize in this way. Even more, individual villages adopt disguised coercive methods. Wanting people to take out land, they elect them as representatives, calling them to take the lead. Nandong also arranged for Party members and cadres to self-report and take the lead, enlightening other cadres and households with a lot of land to self-report. Some meetings did not have anyone self-reporting, so they did not adjourn the meeting, just chewing on it. ... These phenomena were quickly corrected, but they are very worthy of everyone's vigilance. According to an analysis of the situation in sixty-four natural villages, it is not impossible for farmers to voluntarily take out land. Some are afraid of infringing on middle peasants and dare not talk about the policy, and the shrinking thought of not publicizing to middle peasants is also wrong. (Editor's Note: Changzhi's summary and review of this issue is noteworthy. The issue of middle peasants' voluntary land should be handled with special caution in actual implementation to avoid repeating the past mistakes of "forced voluntarism" and causing new deviations and unease.)

(4) The Issue of Confiscating Landlords' and Requisitioning Rich Peasants' Land: In the conclusion of land reform, those who were not thoroughly struggled against or were omitted should be confiscated and requisitioned. In handling this issue, some comrades do not act in accordance with the spirit of the policy. For example, in Zhangtou, District One, the average land per person in the whole village is 4.3 mu, and the rich peasants average 3 mu, which is already lower than the average level of the whole village, but they still say it is not thorough. They are based on the "resettlement standard," that is, they want the property left to him to be similar to the resettlement today, which is equivalent to a second sweeping of the door, and then resettlement. Implicitly admitting that the past sweeping of the door was correct, this is also wrong.

　　如何集中“补绽”？
  　长治结束土改中补偿安置经验
    在结束土改中，如何集中“补绽”进行补偿安置与调剂，是一个较为复杂的问题，以下是长治第一批结束土改村解决补充来源的工作步骤：
    （一）公地、庙地及遗留果实问题：在这问题上一般是先开支部会、人代会讨论，村里有那些遗留果实。大体弄清后，召开群众会民主讨论，自报互报大家找。如高河在群众会上宣布后，群众即提出有二百元现洋没找出来，干部当场即检讨说是忘了（不一定是真忘了，但当群众查问只好承认）。检查出后，群众都高兴说：这可民主彻底了！综合各村情况，一般发现有三种：一种是尚存未分的果实，一种是借给群众的果实，一种是归了公产或入了合作社的。接着研究这些果实如何处理。入了合作社的，在不影响合作社原则上把东西抽回，如有影响可作价归合作社。归了公产的抽出。尚存未分果实的处理较复杂，这里主要问题是错斗中农的东西。有些地方把未分的中农东西也卖了，然后再补偿。中农不满，觉得斗错了我，我的东西又给卖了，可又来补偿我。在这问题上，许多干部思想抵抗，不愿退原物。有的说：“同样是错斗，分了就不退原物，不分就退原物，是否影响别的中农？”我们应教育干部群众分别处理，说明未分的退还，中农满意，也不影响贫雇，这样做正能团结大多数。如果没分的果实也卖了再去补偿，那就是承认过去土改中偏向是对的，这是不合政策的。已分了的，如也要退还原物，就必然影响贫雇，事实上也难作到，只好用别的办法来补偿。
    （二）如何处理党员干部退出多分果实问题：对于这问题，主要是靠对支部党员的教育，开展批评与自我批评，克服党员特权思想，说明退果实的标准，不能低于一般翻身群众的水平，解除真怕不知退多少的顾虑。如南善村诱导党员讨论群众为什么对干部不满？研究结果，主要是多占果实及作风不好。这样使党员自觉到退出多占果实的必要。思想初步打通后，然后进行自报，大家评议应退多少。退什么，从自报中发展党员有三种思想：（一）为了表现自己，本来分的不多或不太多，而退的很多。（二）有少数党员，明明多分了不愿退。（三）也愿退，但不愿退好的。这时应引导展开批评，大家公议该退什么，作出决议，再召开非党干部会、人代会，以同样方法进行。然后党员和干部在农会小组会、公民小组会、群众会上自报并作检讨，让群众发表意见。这样影响非党干部甚至群众中多分的也进行自报，使干群关系初步改善，给下步整党打下基础。
    象以上这样进行了的，党员自觉提高，群众一般满意。另外也有些村有个别党员因启发教育不够，单纯以组织纪律压。高河一个党员赌气的说：“退就退吧！”南董党员张明先说：“我多分是支部讨论过的！我就不退。”这样强迫退果实，结果虽退了，党员毫无觉悟，牢骚不满。更有的在支部会上，没展开批评与自我批评，随便退些就算。这样结果都不好。
    （三）中农自动让地问题：一般情况是开始中农不摸底，有些户要往出土地，但经宣传政策，说明不动中农土地，如愿帮助别人，必须真正自愿，这样，有些又不往出拿了。这样，因怕而“自愿”到真掌握了自愿政策，是我宣传工作获得了效果。在接受中农自动土地上，一般经过五步：（一）自报；（二）开家庭会讨论；（三）人代会与群众摸他心思，什么动机，是否真自愿；（四）允许其三番五次反复，最后真正自愿。
    正确的作法是启发互助互济的觉悟，表扬让地户的互助精神，从积极方面提高群众觉悟。如苍耳壑在讲清了政策后，贾富有自报要让地，他说：“我早就想拿出些地帮助他们（指斗争对象），又怕干部们说我‘可怜对象’。这次上级叫纠这个偏，我情愿拿出三亩半地。”青岗中农李好果拿出二亩地，说：“叫大家都得活下去！”这些出于真心自愿的行动，都得到表扬。高河有人拿出地，群众说恐怕不是真自愿，他着急说：“我真是拿不出心来叫你们看看！”人代会对于这些自动地户，一面摸心思，一面告他们说不愿意了还可再拿回去！”
    另外，有些村坚持自愿的原则不够，有些任务观点，口头上宣传不动中农土地，实际是硬动员中农让地。如柏后有的这样宣传：“你人少做不好，工资高负担重………”这样勉强去动员，这是违犯政策精神的。更有个别村采取变相强迫的作法，想叫人家拿出地，把人家选成代表，叫起带头。南董还有给党员干部布置自报带头、启发别的干部和地多户自报。有的开会没人自报，一直不散会、硬啃。………这些现象虽很快被纠正了，但很值得大家警惕。根据六十四个自然村的情况分析，农民自动往出拿地，并不是没有可能。有些怕侵犯中农而不敢讲政策，不向中农宣传的畏缩思想也是错误的。（编者按：长治对这一问题的总结检讨，是值得注意的、关于中农自动地问题，在实际执行中要特别慎重，以免重复过去“强迫自动”的毛病，而造成新的偏向与不安。）
    （四）没收地主、征收富农土地问题：在结束土改中，被斗不彻底或遗漏下的，应进行没收和征收。在这一问题的处理上，有些同志不按政策精神办事，如一区漳头全村每人平均地四·三亩，富农平均三亩，已低于全村水平，还说不彻底，他根据的是“安置标准”，即是想给他留的财产和今天安置的差不多，等于来个第二次扫地出门，再来安置。无形中承认过去扫地出门是对的，这也是错误的。
