[Hebei-Central News] Discipline Rectification Improves Morale and Combat Effectiveness of Militia in a Village in Jinwu County
　　
    [Jizhong News] The militia in a certain village in the edge area of Jinwu County (newly established county) have greatly improved their combat effectiveness and nearly doubled in size after rectifying discipline and work style. The militia in this village used to have a very bad work style, and sometimes even embezzled under the guise of investigating private property. When the villagers mentioned the militia, they shook their heads and said, "They are too disgraceful!" The parents of the militiamen said, "Come down quickly! We can't afford it, you'll just learn to be bad."
    This serious phenomenon of alienation from the masses attracted the attention of the county and district leaders. In early July, the county and district organized a working group to conduct rectification in the village. After arriving in the village, they first conducted deliberations among the militia. District cadre Xing Jia Cai said, "The militia in all the villages in the county no longer eat public meals, only this village does." Militia instructor Li Shu Ming said, "When I go to the county for meetings this time, everyone in other villages knows that our village's militia has bad discipline. Minister Song announced it at the county conference, it's so embarrassing!" The ideologically advanced militiamen said, "If others don't eat, does that mean we won't eat?" The backward ones said behind their backs, "If we don't get to eat, we won't do it." The working group focused on grasping the backbone elements and educating the backward ones, and after the deliberations matured, a meeting was held for self-criticism. At the meeting, Fan Yu Lin said, "If other villages can do it without eating public meals, why can't our village's militia do it!? I joined the militia to protect the village, I won't do it for eating and drinking." At the meeting, righteousness suppressed evil. Everyone said, "Let's swear from this point on that we will never eat public meals again." Everyone examined their personal shortcomings and discussed exchanging labor with the self-defense forces, with the militia producing on land close to the village and the self-defense forces producing on land far away, so that they could concentrate quickly in case of emergencies.
    After the initial rectification, the militia's work style began to change. To go further, the leadership proposed "five comparisons": compare work style, compare discipline, compare systems, compare production, and compare policies. They called on people to compare with each other, and villages to compare with each other. Discussions were also held by squad. Everyone proposed: actively participate in production, do not gamble, do not drink alcohol, do not spend money recklessly, do not waste the village's resources, and do not do illegal things. They also stipulated a self-criticism meeting every fifteen days, a brief meeting every day, and requesting leave for matters; strengthening combat readiness and protecting the interests of the people. After this movement was launched, the militia's discipline greatly improved. Wang De Wen used to smoke five packs of cigarettes a day, now he doesn't smoke even one. Liu Zhi An used to love to drink alcohol, now he doesn't drink it anymore. In the past, the militia headquarters had three lights on all night, now they only light one. In order to prepare for combat, everyone actively built fortifications. In July, August, and September, the construction of fortifications required a total of more than 150 workdays, all done by the militiamen themselves. Various systems have also been improved, and they are even more active and tenacious in protecting the autumn harvest. On August 20th, an enemy battalion from Xin Zhang, with more than 600 people from four puppet regimental townships, came to the village to loot grain. The militia and the district armed work team and militia company resisted tenaciously, fighting for six and a half hours, killing and wounding 56 enemies, and protecting the people's grain. After the battle, another self-criticism was conducted; in order to save ammunition, they proposed "three no-nos", that is, no shooting if you can't see, no shooting if you're too far away, and no shooting if you can't hit. On August 29th, the enemy invaded again and was repelled by the militia again. On the morning of September 17th, an enemy battalion from Dong Jia Bao, and more than 600 local puppet troops, invaded Li Lan Cheng. At that time, it was the autumn harvest season, and the masses' grain had not yet been fortified. The militia stubbornly held on for four and a half hours, killing and wounding 11 enemies, and preventing the enemy from looting the grain. Since then, the militia's prestige has greatly increased. The villagers came to the militia headquarters to express their condolences and help the militia build fortifications and tunnels. They said, "If it weren't for the militia holding the line like this these few times, the grain would have been looted by the 'white necks' (referring to bandit troops) long ago." Young people automatically asked to join the militia. Now the militia in this village has nearly doubled in size compared to the spring.

　　津武某村民兵整顿纪律
  　作风转变战斗力提高
    【冀中讯】津武县（新设县）边缘区某村民兵，经过整顿纪律、整顿作风后，战斗力大为提高，民兵扩大将近两倍。该村民兵以前作风很坏，甚至有时以查私为名，从中贪污。老乡们一提民兵，就摇着头说：“太不象样了！”民兵家长说：“快下来吧！咱当不起，干来干去都得学坏了。”
    这样严重脱离群众的现象，引起了县区领导上的注意。七月初，县区组织了工作组，到该村进行整顿。到村后首先在民兵中进行酝酿，区干部邢嘉才说：“全县各村民兵都不吃公饭了，光剩下这村了。”民兵指导员李书明说：“这回到县里开会去，人家各村都知道咱村民兵纪律坏，宋部长在全县大会上公布咱们，可丢人啦！”思想进步的民兵说：“人家不吃咱们也不会不吃吗？”落后的背后说：“不让吃饭就不干。”工作组就抓紧对骨干分子的掌握，对落后的进行教育，酝酿成熟后开会检讨。会上范玉林说：“别的村能不吃，咱们村的民兵为什么非吃不行哩！？我参加民兵为的保护村子，要为吃喝我不干了。”会上正气压住了邪气。大家都说：“从这宣誓，再不吃公饭了。”每个人都检讨个人缺点，并讨论出和自卫队换工，民兵生产离村近的地，自卫队替民兵生产远地，以便有情况好集中起来打敌人。
    经过初步整顿后，民兵作风开始转变。领导上为了深入一步，又提出“五比”：比作风、比纪律、比制度、比生产、比政策。号召人与人比，村与村比。并以班为单位进行了讨论。大家提出：积极参加生产，不赌钱，不喝酒，不胡花钱，不浪费村里的东西，不做违法事情。还规定了十五天一次检讨会，每天一次碰头会，有事请假；加强战斗准备，保护老百姓的利益。这一运动开展后，民兵纪律大有改进。王德文过去一天吸五盒烟，现在一盒也不吸了。刘志安过去爱喝酒，现在也不喝了。过去民兵队部一宿三个灯，现在只点一个。为了准备战斗，大家积极修筑工事，七、八、九三月修筑工事共用一百五十多个工，都是民兵们亲手干的。各种制度也健全起来了，护秋中更是积极顽强。八月二十日，辛章敌军一个营，带着四个伪团乡共六百余人，到该村抢粮。该村民兵和区武工队、民兵连顽强抗击，战斗六个半钟头，毙伤敌人五十六名，保护了老百姓的粮食。战后又进行了检讨；为节约弹药，提出“三不打”，即看不见不打，离远了不打，打不着不打。八月二十九日，敌人又进犯，又被民兵打退。九月十七日晨，董家堡敌军一营，及当地伪军共六百多人，向里澜城进犯。当时正在过秋，群众的粮食还没坚壁，该村民兵顽强坚持四个半钟头，毙伤敌人十一名，没让敌人抢了粮食去。从此，民兵威信大为提高。老乡们找到民兵队部慰问，帮助民兵修工事、地道，他们说：“这几回要没有民兵这么顶着打，粮食早叫‘白脖’（指匪军）们抢光了。”青壮年们自动要求参加民兵。现在该村民兵已比春天扩大了将近两倍。
