　　Snapshots of Enlistment
　　A Dispute
　　In Xi Village, Fourth District, Xing Tang County, Communist Party members Wang Yumin and Wang Liuyuan, brothers, were vying to sign up for the army. Liuyuan said, "It's often said that elder brothers should yield to younger brothers, but you can't yield to me when it comes to joining the army! I'm older, so I'll go first!" Yumin said, "You should yield to me this time, you're better at farming at home than I am!" The two argued incessantly, and the next day Yumin rushed to sign up.

　　A Shared Wish
　　Feng Guoshun, the political instructor of the militia squad in Baihe Village, Fuping, heard the call to enlist and discussed it with his wife in the evening: "There are three brothers in my family. The youngest isn't eligible, and the second one signed up but was turned back twice. This time I want to go, are you willing?" His wife turned her face away and didn't say a word. Guoshun talked for a long time, but seeing that she wasn't listening, he got angry and ignored her. Later, his wife turned around and said, "Who said I wouldn't let you go! I'm just afraid you'll desert and become a laughingstock!" The next day, Guoshun's wife sent him to sign up.

　　Chased for Twenty Li
　　In Sigou Village, Huguan, there were two old women: Mother Cunfu and Dog-Child's mother, both vying to send their sons to join the army. Cunfu wasn't home that day, so Dog-Child's mother sent her son to enlist. Mother Cunfu was beside herself with anxiety. When Cunfu returned home, the village cadre said, "The recruitment is complete!" The old lady didn't say a word, grabbed Cunfu and ran twenty li to the district office, saying, "My Cunfu is eighteen years old, just the right age. He missed the registration in the village because I was too late, I'm determined to have him join the army!" The district cadre welcomed and comforted her. The old lady turned around and instructed her son, "Don't come back until you capture Chiang Kai-shek!"

　　Didn't Make it Last Year
　　Determined to Go This Year
　　In the northwest street of Yi Jing Village, Second District, Shahe County, when the district cadre called for enlistment, Hao Xishuan quickly rushed to sign up, saying, "I didn't make it last year. Now that victory is near, I'm determined to join the army." Zhang Liuzhu secretly asked the teacher, "They didn't let me go last year, will they let me go this year?" The teacher said, "They will!" He was overjoyed and immediately ran to the meeting to sign up. Then Zhang Gengsuo also signed up. Li Lianshuan from the southeast street said, "Folks, you all should produce well at home. If I don't capture Chiang Kai-shek alive, I swear I won't come home!"
　　　　　　　　　　(Shi Yuanjing)
　　No One is Going Back!
　　During the enlistment in Nanqi Village, Pingshun, the district committee assigned three slots, but twelve people went at once. When reviewing the applications, whoever was asked to go back refused. Branch Secretary Liu Jianze spoke first, saying, "This is the fourth time I've signed up this year. Whether it's approved or not, I'm determined to go!" Zhang Lai asked to go, but the doctor said he was sick and wouldn't let him. He cried in anger and went to the district committee to firmly express, "I'm not going back!"

　　参军剪影
    一场争论
    行唐县四区习村，党员王育民，王六元弟兄二人争着报名参军。六元说：“常说兄让弟，但参军可不能让给你！我大，我先去！”育民说：“这回更得让着我，你在家种地比我强！”二人争论不休，第二天育民抢着报了名。

  　同心事
    阜平白河村中队部指导员冯国顺听到号召参军，晚上和媳妇商量：“我家弟兄三个，老三不够格，老二报名退回来了两次，这回我想去，你愿意不？”媳妇扭过脸去不吭气。国顺讲了半天，见她不听，气得呼呼地不理她了。后来媳妇转过脸来说：“谁说不叫你去啦！我是怕你去了要开小差，叫人笑话呀！”第二天国顺的媳妇送他报了名。

  　追了二十里
    壶关寺沟村，有两位老婆子：存富娘和狗孩家，二人争着送子参军。存富这天没在家，狗孩家就把儿子送去入伍了。存富娘急的没法，等存富回到家，村干部说：“扩军完成了！”老太太二话不说，拉着存富跑了二十里路追到区公所说：“俺存富十八岁了，正够格，在村上误了报名，我一心叫他去参军！”区干部欢迎安慰了她，老太太回头又嘱咐儿子：“抓不住蒋介石，不要回来！”

    去年没去成
  　今年坚决去
    沙河县二区伊井村西北街在区干部号召参军时，郝喜拴赶紧抢着报名说：“去年没去上，这时快胜利了，我坚决要去参军。”张刘住背地去问教员：“去年不叫我去，今年叫去不？”教员说：“叫去！”他欢喜得不行，马上跑到大会报了名，接着张更锁也报了名。东南街李来拴说：“老乡们：你们在家好好生产，我要不把蒋介石活捉住，誓死不回家！”　　　　　　　　　　（施元景）
    谁也不回去！
    平顺南岐村参军时，区委布置了三名，一下去了十二名，审查时，叫谁回去，谁不回去，支书刘建则先说：“今年我是第四次报名啦，不管批准不批准，我一定要去！”张来要求去，医生说我有病，不叫去。他气的哭着，又去向区委坚决表示：“不回去！”
