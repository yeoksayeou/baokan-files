　　Reply from the Transportation Department of the Garrison Headquarters
　　As early as September 14th, Secretary Yan of the Supply Department had already instructed over the phone that the × Village Shoe Factory should allocate 58,000 pairs of shoes to the × Army Corps, asking us to make a transportation plan and requiring a one-time shipment. At that time, we wanted the shoe allocation procedures, or a letter of introduction from the Supply Department. Secretary Yan replied, "The number of shoes is not a problem, and a letter of introduction is not necessary. I will notify the shoe factory by phone. When the time comes, just have the garrison headquarters' dispatch note, and they can be issued." On the 19th, we again inquired about the procedures, and Secretary Yan replied as before. Although this was the case, we were still not at ease. We sent Comrade Wang Fengwu to the shoe factory to negotiate and asked if they had such a large number. The factory director said, "There are plenty of shoes, even more." Before the shipment, we received instructions from the Logistics Command to add another 5,000 pairs, for a total of 63,000 pairs. Because Comrade Wang Fengwu had already negotiated and confirmed that there were shoes, we did not go to negotiate again. We immediately notified the Xing Tang Garrison Headquarters. On the same day (19th), Comrade Liu Guoshi of the Xing Tang Garrison Headquarters, holding the garrison headquarters' dispatch note and carrying 102 large carts and 120 small carts, arrived at × Village. However, the shoe factory refused to issue the shoes because they had no procedures, and Liu Guoshi's negotiations with them were unsuccessful. They insisted on having procedures from the Clothing Bureau. Comrade Liu called the garrison headquarters, but because the garrison headquarters was too far away, he had to call the Clothing Bureau and asked them to send the procedures to the shoe factory (because it was nearby). The shoe factory did not agree, so Comrade Liu Guoshi had to personally go to get the procedures, taking two days back and forth, causing the waste of civilian labor for two days.
　　After obtaining the procedures, the shoe factory did not have enough shoes, short by more than 12,000 pairs. Therefore, they had to return the transportation capacity for 12,000 pairs of shoes, causing the masses even greater losses.
　　Another waste of 200 head of livestock, the entire process was the same as the above. The main reason was that the procedures were not completed, and the garrison headquarters should bear some responsibility.
　　Also, on November 17-18, Comrade × of the Supply Department personally telegraphed that there were × thousand cotton-padded coats in × place, and the Clothing Bureau had prepared them, asking the garrison headquarters to bring transportation capacity to pick them up. When the responsible cadres of the garrison headquarters went, it turned out to be a false alarm. There were no coats in × place, causing a great waste.
　　Regarding the return of 700 head of livestock for two days on October 16th, when this plan was originally made, people from the North Yue Military Region's Armed Forces Department and the Finance Department participated and negotiated with the garrison headquarters. It was decided that on the 16th, the 700 head of livestock would be concentrated in × place. (This transportation plan can be checked by the Logistics Command and the Transportation Department of this headquarters, and the comrades of the North Yue Military Region also have a copy of this plan).
　　The 4th Military Sub-district Armed Forces Department notified the Jingxing County Government. After receiving the notification, Jingxing County concentrated the livestock in × place on the 15th. However, this was a whole day in advance, and the garrison headquarters was not notified in advance. The garrison headquarters personnel had already arrived at the location on the afternoon of the 15th. (This can be proved by the Logistics Command and the Military Industry Warehouse, because the light and heavy troops of this headquarters arrived there on the morning of the 16th to take over the task.)
　　Asking the local villagers, "Have any livestock come?" The villagers replied, "Livestock did come, but later the Jingxing County Armed Forces Department sent someone to take a letter and take them back!" At that time, the garrison headquarters personnel did not know why they came early and then went back. It was not until they received the order from the Jingxing County Armed Forces Department that they learned that the 4th Military Sub-district had changed the transportation plan (but did not notify us immediately), and it was scheduled to be concentrated on the 18th. This incident was not caused by the garrison headquarters personnel not going and the civilian labor returning. In the execution of tasks, some county armed forces departments are very enthusiastic about supporting the front and often concentrate the forces ahead of schedule or on time, which is of great help to the logistics work. We are very satisfied with this aspect; however, in the future, if the forces are concentrated in advance, please be sure to notify the garrison headquarters first, so as to avoid unnecessary losses to the people.
　　The above is a comprehensive material based on the reports of the Zhengding Garrison Headquarters and the Xingtang Garrison Headquarters and our personal investigation. We hope that the units or individual comrades involved in the above matters will make a review and put forward opinions on the above-mentioned inappropriate points.

### 兵站部运输处的答复

专栏：检讨与答复

　　兵站部运输处的答复
    早在九月十四日，供给部阎秘书曾在电话上布置由×庄鞋厂拨给×兵团鞋子五万八千双，叫我们作运输计划，并要求一次起运。当时我们要拨鞋手续，或由供给部写介绍信，阎秘书则答复“鞋数不成问题，介绍信亦不须要，我在电话上通知鞋厂，到时只要有兵站解单，即可发出。”到了十九日，我们又追问手续问题，阎秘书答复仍如以前虽然如此我们仍不放心，我们又派王凤悟同志亲到鞋厂接洽，并问是否有此巨数。厂长讲：“鞋有的是再多些亦有。”起运前，接后勤司令部指示，又增添五千双，共合六万三千双了。因王凤悟同志已去接谈过有鞋子，于是未再去接洽，我们着即通知行唐兵站，于当日（十九日）行唐兵站刘国士同志持兵站部解单，携带一百零二辆大车，一百廿辆小车带至×庄，但鞋厂因无手续不发鞋，刘同志与他们交涉仍不发，非要被服局的手续不可，刘同志打电话告兵站，因兵站离太远只有打电话告被服局，转托被服局将手续送到鞋厂（因离的近），鞋厂未答应，于是刘国士同志只得亲去取手续，往返两天，使民力浪费了两天。
    取得手续后，鞋厂鞋数不够，少一万二千余双，故只得将一万两千双鞋子的运力放回，使群众又加重了损失。
    又一次二百头牲口的浪费，前后经过与以上的情形一样，主要因为鞋厂距被服局甚远，若让群众等着要好几天，不如放回还可少受些损失。
    以上两个实例，都说明是因手续未办清楚而引起的，兵站应负一部分责任。
    又于十一月十七—十八日供给部×同志亲自电告×地有棉大衣×千件，被服局已准备好，要兵站带运输力前去起运。当兵站派负责干部去后，结果落空，×地并无大衣，造成很大浪费。
    关于十月十六日七百头牲口的两天空回情形，原来在订立这一计划时，有北岳区武装部、财政厅派人参加，与兵站部一起商定，决定十六日将七百牲口集中×地。（该运输计划后勤司令部及本部运输处都可查考，并北岳区同志亦抄有此计划）。
    由四分区武装部通知井陉县政府，井陉县接得通知后，于十五日即将牲口集中×地，但这样提前一整日，事前并未通知兵站部，而十五日下午兵站人员即已到达该地。（此点后勤司令部及军工仓库可证明，因十六日晨即有本部轻重部队到那里接收了任务。）
    询问当地老乡，问“是否有牲口来？”老乡答：“有牲口来，后来又叫井陉县武装部派人拿信给要回去了！”当时兵站人员不知何故，既提前来，又为何回去；等后来接到井陉县武装部的命令才知由四分区将运输计划改变（但又未即时通知我们），定十八日集中。这件事并非因兵站人员未去而民力返回。在执行任务时有些县武装部对支前很热情，往往提前或准时集中，对后勤工作帮助非常之大，我们在这方面很感到满意；但在以后若提前集中务必先通知兵站一下，以免让人民受到不必要的损失。
    以上是根据正定兵站、行唐兵站的报告及我们亲自调查的综合材料，我们希望与以上事情有关的单位或个别同志作一检讨，并对以上不妥之处提出意见。
