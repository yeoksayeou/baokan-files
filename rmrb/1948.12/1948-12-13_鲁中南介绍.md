The area extends east to the Yellow Sea, west to the Grand Canal and the Yellow River, bordering the North China Liberated Area. It is bounded to the north by the Jiaoji Railway, bordering the Jiaodong and Bohai areas, and to the south by the Longhai Railway, bordering the Northern Jiangsu area. It spans six hundred li in both directions, covering an area of approximately 75,000 square kilometers, with a population of about 15 million.
