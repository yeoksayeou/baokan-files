　　Free Greece—Since the establishment of the Provisional Democratic Government of the Greek Liberated Areas on December 24th of last year, the area governed by this democratic government under the leadership of the Greek Communist Party has formally become the Greek people's own country. In order to distinguish it from the reactionary government of Athens under the wing of American imperialism, it is called Free Greece. It is a good contrast to "Athens Greece," which represents democracy versus fascism, freedom versus unfreedom. In Free Greece, the people have truly become masters of the country, their lives have been improved, land reform is being implemented, feudal exploitation is being eliminated, and they are taking the path of New Democracy. In Athens Greece, the people are subjected to the suppression of the Athens puppet government, the running dogs of Britain and the United States; hunger and unemployment frequently plague them. No matter how the Greek royalist fascists seek help from their foreign fathers, British and American imperialism, their demise is inevitable. More than three-quarters of Greece has been liberated and democratic regimes have been established. Under the victorious offensive of the Greek People's Liberation Army under the leadership of the Greek Communist Party, the entire territory of Greece will eventually become Free Greece.
    Cuba—Is a horizontally long island nation, located in the southeast of the United States. It is much smaller than our Hebei Province. But the land is very fertile, and its sugar production is the highest in the world. There are thousands of overseas Chinese there. Out of 4.8 million people, one in every thirty-one is a Communist Party member. American imperialism has always wanted to invade this place, but it has been constantly resisted by the Cuban people.

    自由希腊——自去年十二月二十四日希腊解放区临时民主政府成立后，这个由希腊共产党领导下的民主政府所管的地方，就正式成为希腊人民自己的国家；为了和美帝卵冀下的雅典反动政府统治区别，就称之为自由希腊。她与“雅典希腊”是民主与法西斯、自由与不自由的一个很好的对照。在自由希腊的人民已真正做了国家的主人，生活得到改善，实行着土地改革，消灭封建剥削，走着新民主主义的道路。而在雅典希腊呢，人民受着英美走狗雅典傀儡政府的镇压，饥饿与失业时常袭击着他们。不管希腊保皇法西斯如何向他洋爸爸英美帝国主义求助，他们的死亡是不可避免的。希腊全境四分之三以上都已获得解放，建立了民主政权。在希共领导下的希腊人民解放军胜利进攻下，希腊全境终于都会变成自由希腊的。
    古巴——是一个横长的岛国，在美国的东南。比咱们的河北省还小得多。但土地很肥，砂糖的产量为世界第一位。那里的华侨有数千人。在四百八十万人中，每三十一人就有一个共产党员。美帝一直想侵略这个地方，但不断遭到古巴人民的反对。
