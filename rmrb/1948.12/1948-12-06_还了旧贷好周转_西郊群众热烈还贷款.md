　　Repaying Old Loans Helps Circulation
　　Masses in the Western Suburbs Enthusiastically Repay Loans
　　[Our dispatch] The masses in the western suburban villages of Pingding, Shanxi, have been busy these past few days milling rice and peeling corn. In addition to handing over the public grain owed, their main goal is to raise money to repay old loans. When the topic of loans is brought up, the villagers here all say in unison: "Loans are a huge deal in our village! If it weren't for the government loans, some families in our village really wouldn't have made it through that famine last year!"
　　This village was only liberated in March of last year. After a long period of looting by the Japanese bandits, followed by Yan Xishan's "Soldiers and Farmers United as One" policy, the two years after the Japanese surrender were the most disastrous for this village. The village was twenty *li* from the city, just close enough to be subjected to the depredations of Yan Xishan's clutches. Seizing grain and conscripting soldiers created a no-man's-land. Villagers fled into the deep mountains from August 1946 until the area was liberated last March, when they returned. The disaster of those eight months had barely passed when they were hit with a bad harvest in the fall. During that disastrous year, the government provided a total of six loans of grain, wheat seed, and assistance in organizing production. In particular, the government's loans of wheat seed and production loans played a considerable role in supporting disaster victims to engage in production and get through the famine. Relying on this capital for living and production, the disaster victims organized various forms of production, such as transporting coal, selling grain, miscellaneous goods, working as carpenters and blacksmiths, and working as porters and peddlers, to make a living, get through the famine, and restore and develop production.
　　Having benefited from the loans, they are generally enthusiastic and proactive about repaying them. Although they have just climbed out of disaster and have only just caught their breath, they still try to repay the loans. They say with great confidence, "The government has plans and foresight; when we are in trouble, the government will lend to us again."

　　还了旧贷好周转
  　西郊群众热烈还贷款
    【本报讯】山西平定西郊村的群众，这两天都在忙着碾米剥玉茭，除交短下的公粮以外，主要是筹款还旧贷。说起贷款，这里老乡们异口同声的说：“贷款在俺村可是顶了大事啦！要不是政府贷款，俺村有些户可真过不来去年那个荒年！”
    这村是去年三月才获得解放的。经过日冠长期抢掠，接着来的是阎匪“兵农合一”，日寇投降后的二年，是这村灾难最深重的二年，村子距城二十里，恰够着受阎匪魔手的劫掠，抢粮抓丁造成了无人区，村民从四六年八月逃入深山，至去年三月该地解放后才回来。八个月的灾难刚过，秋季又遭了个坏年景。在这灾难的年头，政府前后共六次的贷款贷粮、贷麦种及组织生产的帮助。特别是政府的借麦种及生产贷款，在扶植灾民生产渡荒上起了相当大的作用。灾民们依靠这些作生活和生产的资本，组织了运煤炭、贩卖粮食、杂货、做木铁工和担挑小贩等各种生产，渡荒糊口之外，又重新恢复和发展了生产。
    他们受到贷款的好处，对还贷一般是热情而积极的。虽然是刚从灾难中爬起，刚还过一口气来，也多想法归还，他们是那样充满信心的说：“政府是有计划有打算的，没办法时政府就再贷给咱”。
