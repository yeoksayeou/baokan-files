　　Embassy – The official office of a country's diplomatic ambassador in the country where they are stationed is called an embassy. The ambassador's power lies in specifically executing the orders of their own government, presenting opinions or matters requiring negotiation to the foreign ministry of the host country. For example, documents from a country's president, representing the government or people, to the president of another country are often delivered by the ambassador in person. These transmitted documents are called letters of credence.
　　Consulate – An office established by a country in major foreign commercial ports to protect its overseas citizens is called a consulate.
　　Ruhr – Located in northwestern Germany, it is Germany's mining center and also a heavy industry center. The entire area has over 1,200 square miles of coalfields, with coal reserves accounting for 60 percent of the country's total, and extraction accounting for 75 percent. The quality of the coal is excellent, most of which can be used for coking, which is the foundation of the steel industry. After the defeat of the fascist Hitler, it became the British occupation zone. Regarding the Ruhr, the Soviet Union has always firmly advocated joint management by the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France to prevent the resurgence of Germany's military potential. However, U.S. imperialism wants to seize control of the Ruhr as a base for enslaving the entire Europe, and it continues to support the Nazi big capitalists who still hold key positions in the Ruhr. On November 9th, the U.S. and British imperialists simply returned the Ruhr to the Nazi big capitalists, reviving Nazi forces. However, this illegal decision, which violates the principle of the four countries jointly handling the German issue, has now been protested by the French Communist Party and the French people.
　　Nazi – This is the name for the National Socialist Party of Germany, headed by Hitler. The National Socialist Party was extremely reactionary, implemented dictatorship, suppressed the people at home using secret police, and engaged in military aggression abroad. The Second World War was provoked by these Nazi elements. After the war, U.S. imperialism still tried its best to preserve Nazi forces, colluding with them to oppose the Soviet Union and the people.

    大使馆——一国外交大使在所驻国的办事机关，叫大使馆。大使权力在具体执行自己政府的命令，把意见或必须交涉的事情向驻在国外交部提出。如一国总统，代表本国政府或人民，给他国总统的文书，往往都由大使去见时递送。这种转送的文书叫国书。
    领事馆——本国派驻外国各大商埠、保护侨民的机关叫领事馆。
    鲁尔——在德国西北部，为德国矿产中心，也是重工业中心。全境有一千二百余方里煤田，煤藏量占全国百分之六十，开采量占全国百分之七十五，煤的质量极好，大部可以炼焦，是钢铁业的基础。法西斯希特勒败亡后，这里是英国占领区。对于鲁尔，苏联一向坚决主张苏、美、英、法四国共管，以防止德国军事潜力的再起。而美帝国主义想夺取鲁尔的控制权，作为她奴役整个欧洲的基地，不停地扶植在鲁尔仍任要职的纳粹大资本家，在上月九日美、英帝国主义更干脆把鲁尔交还给纳粹大资本家了，使纳粹势力复活。不过这种违背四国共同处理德国问题的原则的非法决定，现在已遭到了法共与法国人民的抗议。
    纳粹——是德国以希特勒为首的国社党的称呼。国社党极为反动，实行独裁，在国内利用秘密警察镇压人民，对国外从事军事侵略，第二次世界大战就是这些纳粹分子挑引起来的。战后美帝仍然竭力保存纳粹势力，和他们互相勾结反苏反人民。
