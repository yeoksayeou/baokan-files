　　The Shijiazhuang Reformatory
    Chen Maoyi
    The Shijiazhuang Relief Home was renamed the Reformatory in January of this year after liberation. Preliminary ideological remolding was carried out on the inmates, and they were organized to produce.

    When I took over the institution last November, there were 212 inmates, most of whom were old, weak, disabled, women, and children. After explaining our party's land policy, 147 people were discharged and returned home to share the land by the end of December. Eight people stayed in the city to find their own living, and nine were introduced to hygiene work. Only 28 people remained in the institution.

    In January of this year, the municipal government issued an order to dissolve the brothels, and 71 prostitutes (including two secret prostitutes) and six young girls raised in the brothels were sent to the institution for reformation. Our educational policy for them is mainly: to restore and cultivate their self-esteem, to eliminate the evil habits of promiscuity and parasitism, and then, according to their wishes, to either return home, change careers, or get married. Among them, 30 people were married after being reviewed by the institution. According to the survey, the relationship between 20 couples is very good, and they can manage their families diligently; six divorced, of which three were due to the women's inability to endure hardship, and three were the responsibility of the men; one couple's relationship was not good at first, but after being discovered and educated, it has improved; the situation of three leaving the city is unknown. The young girls are still learning and producing in the institution. The rest are allowed to return home or change careers. Among them, 17 people had families in the city and were allowed to return home 20 days after entering the institution. Later, it was discovered that most of them went to the Kuomintang-controlled areas, because the education time was too short, and their thinking was not deeply enlightened. Therefore, the general time should not be too short, and it should be best to have three months.

    Secondly, it accommodated the disabled, beggars (Shijiazhuang suffered from ten years of plundering by Japanese invaders and Chiang Kai-shek bandits, resulting in poverty and exhaustion, so there were some beggars), unaccompanied children (including those who were petty thieves, child brides, and those who were sent by Chiang Kai-shek's task to infiltrate the liberated areas), pseudo-soldiers who came from the Chiang Kai-shek area, landlords or loafers who were unwilling to participate in labor after the land reform, and farmers who came to the city to hang around during the slack season because of the low standard of living in the countryside. (Editor's note: The reformatory should not accommodate Chiang's soldiers who have come over to our area. The government has other arrangements. The reformatory should not accommodate landlords, loafers who evade labor, or farmers who come to the city to hang around. They should be persuaded or notified to be taken back by their villages and forced to participate in labor.) The institution guides and organizes their lives, production, and learning according to their different situations. In the past year, after short-term education, 263 people have been assisted in returning home or finding their own living, and 82 people are now staying in the institution.

    In the liberated areas, people who are willing to work can live a life of plenty. At the beginning, the institution had 3 million yuan (Jicha, same below). In early April, the municipal government allocated 4 million yuan, and in early October, it allocated another 4.8 million yuan. By the end of November, it had made a profit of 30 million yuan. Although the reformatory mostly consists of the disabled and children, under the guidance and organization of production (mainly weaving and making shoes), since April, living expenses have been partially self-sufficient, and by July, they have been completely self-sufficient. The food and various facilities have also been improved compared to before.

    The Reformatory currently still has the following difficulties and shortcomings in its work: First, the institution has successively accommodated 23 petty thieves. They flee whenever they have the opportunity (up to five or six times). Their methods are clever. For example, Liu ××, 16 years old, from May to October, according to his own confession, stole up to 200,000 yuan in Jicha, which is a great harm to social order. We still have no good methods to manage and teach them. Second, insufficient attention is paid to the cultural education of children. Third, the diversity of production leadership is neglected. For example, when the sales of cloth are not smooth, it feels like the turnover is not flexible. Fourth, they are not good at transforming the institution's old employees. Finally, cadres are somewhat contemptuous of the work of the reformatory in their thinking. Therefore, they are not at ease in their work, lack a sense of responsibility, and are somewhat indifferent to the inmates. After learning about the significance of the reformatory cause, their thinking has generally improved. They realize that transforming the old society is not just about shouting slogans, but about concretely transforming it bit by bit. Transforming these people who have been harmed by the old society into the productive forces of the new society is the concrete transformation of the old society, and this work position is glorious.

　　石家庄市的教养院
    陈茂仪
    石家庄市救济院自解放后，于今年一月改称教养院，对院民进行了初步的思想改造，并组织了他们生产。
    去年十一月我接收该院时，原有院民二百一十二名，绝大多数系老弱残废、妇女、儿童，自讲解我党土地政策后，截至十二月底，先后出院回家分地者一百四十七名，八人留本市自谋生活，九人介绍作卫生工作，留院者仅二十八名。
    今年一月市府明令解散妓院后，有妓女七十一名（其中暗娼二人），妓院蓄养的小女孩六名，送该院改造。我们对其教育方针主要是：恢复和培养她们的自尊心，革除淫乱寄生的邪恶习气，然后根据其自愿，或回家、或转业或结婚。其中有三十人经院方审查与人结婚。据调查二十个夫妇间的感情很好，能勤俭治家；六个离了婚，其中三个系女方不能吃苦耐劳，三个则应由男方负责；一个起先感情不好，经发觉后予以教育，今已有所改进；三个离市情况不明。小女孩现仍留院学习和生产。余则任其回家或转业。其中十七人因在本市有家，在入院二十天后，即允许回家，后发现大多数去蒋区，因教育时间过短，思想上未能深入启发。因此，一般时间不应过短，而应以三个月的时间为最好。
    其次，收容了残废，乞丐（本市遭受日寇和蒋匪统治搜刮十年，致使民穷财尽，故有部分乞丐）、无依靠儿童（其中有当小偷的、童养媳以及接受蒋匪任务而钻入解放区者）、有由蒋区投奔来此之伪军，有因土地改革后不愿参加劳动的地主或二流子，有因农村生活程度较低乘农闲时来城市混混的农民（编者按：蒋军投奔我区者，教养院不应收容，政府另有按置；逃避劳动之地主、二流子，或来城市闲混的农民，教养院亦不应收容，应说服或通知其本村领回，强制其参加劳动。）该院按其不同情况，指导和组织他们的生活、生产与学习。一年来，经过短期教育，资助返家或自谋生活者有二百六十三人，今留院者八十二人。
    在解放区，只要肯劳动的人，就能丰衣足食。开始时，该院有资金三百万元（冀钞、下同），四月初，市府拨发四百万元，十月初又拨给四百八十万元，至十一月底共盈利三千万元。教养院虽多系残废和儿童，但在领导和组织生产的方针下（主要是织布和做鞋），自四月份起，生活费用已能部分自给，到七月份则能全部自给。在伙食和各种设备方面，亦较前提高。
    教养院目前工作中仍有如下困难与缺点：第一、该院先后收容小偷二十三名，他们一有机会即行逃跑（多至五、六次者），手段高明，如刘××，十六岁，自五月至十月间，据其自己承认，行盗所得即达冀钞二十万元，这对社会秩序危害甚大，我们至今尚无好的方法管教。第二、对儿童的文化教育注意不够。第三、忽视了对生产领导的多样性，如当布的销路不畅时，就感到周转不灵。第四、对该院旧有职员不善于改造他们。最后，干部在思想上多少有些轻视教养院的工作，因之，工作不安心，缺乏责任心，对院民有些冷漠，后经过对教养院事业意义的学习，一般思想上有改进，认识到改造旧社会，不是光凭口喊，而是要具体的一点一滴的改造。把这些被旧社会损害的人们改造过来，成为新社会的生产力量，这就是具体的改造旧社会，这个工作岗位是光荣的。
