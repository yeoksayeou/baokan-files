　　The Treasure Trove of Marxist-Leninist Thought
    ——Commemorating the Tenth Anniversary of the Publication of “History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) Short Course”
    By Ding Silepov, translated by Song Enze
    October 1, 1938, saw the publication of Comrade Stalin's classic work, "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) Short Course." This outstanding creative Marxist-Leninist work profoundly elucidated the laws of social development. It scientifically and theoretically synthesized the great historical experience of the Bolshevik Party, a party that has been and is unparalleled by any other political party in the world.
    "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) Short Course" clearly outlined the heroic struggle of the Bolshevik Party for the victory of the socialist revolution and for the triumph of socialism. The history of the Party is discussed in connection with changes in economic and class relations and international situations.
    In Stalin's work, the characteristics of the Bolshevik Party's ideological, organizational, political, and theoretical preparations are comprehensively elucidated. The history of the Bolshevik Party is discussed as the history of the development of Leninism; Marxism-Leninism is illustrated through action.
    "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) Short Course" is an encyclopedia of basic knowledge of Marxism-Leninism. It explains the new things that Lenin and Stalin brought to Marxism. Based on the most profound analysis of the laws of capitalist development in the era of imperialism, Lenin and Stalin created a complete theory of proletarian revolution and armed the working class with the doctrine that socialism could be victorious in one country. Stalin's book skillfully demonstrates how the proletarian revolution becomes a reality through the dictatorship of the proletariat, with the Soviets—the most democratic regime in the world—as its state form. With vast historical data, it illustrates the Bolshevik solution to national and peasant problems, as well as the strategic and tactical problems of Lenin and Stalin, which is the science of the proletariat leading the class struggle and is a fully developed doctrine of the Marxist-Leninist party. "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) Short Course" includes Comrade Stalin's brilliant work "On Dialectical and Historical Materialism," a pinnacle of Marxist-Leninist philosophical thought. In this text, dialectical materialism is developed as the theoretical foundation of communism and as the worldview of the Bolshevik Party. The theoretical position of Marxist-Leninist philosophy is explained in close connection with the Party's practical activities.
    The scientific history of the CPSU (B) proves that Lenin and Stalin, in various historical periods of the Party, summarized historical facts and bravely pushed forward Marxist theory, paving many new paths and waging a relentless struggle against dogmatism. "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) Short Course" is clear evidence of the powerful transforming power of Marxist-Leninist doctrine. Millions of people embrace great ideals in their hearts, thus strengthening the Soviet people's belief that communism will inevitably and completely triumph.
    I
    As early as the cradle days of Bolshevism, Lenin and Stalin put forward a task: to root socialist ideology in the workers' movement. Fearlessly overcoming countless difficulties in the most complex environments, Lenin and Stalin formed the Bolshevik Party in workers' groups. They painstakingly gathered and educated cadres, armed their minds, and tempered them in the harsh struggle against all enemies of the working class. They illuminated the political struggle of the working people with the never-extinguished light of Marxist-Leninist theory.
    Marxist-Leninist doctrine possesses a power capable of overcoming everything. Throughout history, various theories attempting to point out the path of social development and depict the future have been proposed. However, these were not scientific theories, not theories linked to the lives and struggles of the masses, and not theories that unearthed the true laws of social development, so they ultimately became the views of scholars and could not win over the masses.
    Marxism-Leninism truthfully reflects the demands of the development of social material life. Its conclusions and laws are based on and derived from real life. Marxism-Leninism is the scientific expression of the fundamental interests of the working class. This is the great doctrine of the proletariat. It consolidates and develops day by day, and its influence on the masses continues to increase.
    Leninism—Marxism in the era of imperialism and proletarian revolution—was one of the ideological trends of the workers' movement in the period from 1903 to 1917. It paved a mass road for itself by waging a cruel struggle against petty-bourgeois parties and ideological trends—Mensheviks, Socialist-Revolutionaries, anarchists, and all kinds of opportunists. In this struggle, the Party staunchly defended its greatest asset—its ideological property, its ideological baggage.
    Comrade Stalin vividly portrayed the great image of Lenin, the leader and teacher of the working people. "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) Short Course" powerfully points out how Lenin enriched Marxism with new laws and how great an ideological wealth Lenin preserved for the Party by resisting the betrayal of the enemies of revolutionary Marxism. Lenin developed the Party's ideological foundation in "What Is To Be Done?"; developed the Party's organizational foundation in "One Step Forward, Two Steps Back"; developed the Party's tactical foundation in "Two Tactics of Social-Democracy in the Democratic Revolution"; and developed the Party's theoretical foundation in "Materialism and Empirio-criticism," a work that had decisive significance for the education of the Bolshevik Party at that time.
    Comrade Stalin was a faithful and outstanding comrade-in-arms of Lenin in studying the Party's doctrine. As early as when Bolshevism first showed its brilliance, Comrade Stalin had already written many theoretical works—"Briefly on Party Disagreements," "The Proletarian Class and the Proletarian Party," "Anarchism or Socialism?" etc.—in which the foundations of the Marxist party were brilliantly clarified and developed. These works by Stalin became a great contribution to the treasure trove of Marxism-Leninism.
    The theoretical works of Lenin and Stalin educated and ideologically tempered the party of the working class. In the revolutionary ideas developed by Lenin and Stalin, the working class and the working masses saw, and now see, a scientific reflection of their own immediate interests and struggle goals, and the Bolshevik Party they created represents their own capable leaders and teachers.
    Armed with the doctrines of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, the Party led the working class and all working people through the crucible of three revolutions. The most difficult conditions of the dark reactionary period after the failure of the First Russian Revolution failed to crush the Bolshevik Party; at that time, the Bolshevik Party's organization, as Comrade Stalin said, was in fact surrounded by the despair and lack of confidence spread by the liquidators and revolutionary traitors like the ocean.
    Under the conditions of frantic police persecution, the Party united the masses around its slogans. While intensively preparing for the struggle for the proletariat to seize power, the Bolshevik Party once again proved its ability to successfully lead the struggle of the working class during the first revolutionary upsurge.
    The Bolsheviks were the only party during World War I that was able to remain faithful to the revolution and unwaveringly hold high the banner of internationalism and the banner of resolute struggle against imperialist war.
    In the complex period of preparing for the Great October Socialist Revolution, when various events were constantly developing and the Bolsheviks needed to demonstrate courageous and skillful tactics at all times and in all places, the party of Lenin and Stalin carried out great work: it united the working masses, politically educated them, and mobilized them around its slogans. The Party armed the masses with a great purpose that gave birth to great mass strength.
    The Bolshevik Party rescued the Soviet motherland from the great disasters that threatened it and from the spiritual and material enslavement of foreign imperialism. It won over the revolutionary masses with its thorough and wise policies and organized the working class to overcome the enemy's achievements. All other parties in the Soviet state that attempted to lead the working people went completely bankrupt politically. One of the decisive characteristics of the Great October Socialist Revolution was that it was carried out under the banner of the overall leadership of a single party—the Communist Party.
    Comrade Stalin said: "The period from 1903 to October 1917 was a period of cruel struggle of opinions among the working class of our country, a period of struggle between Bolsheviks, Mensheviks, and Socialist-Revolutionaries to influence the working class. During this period, the working class of the Soviet Union went through three revolutions. In the fires of these revolutions, they tested and examined these political parties, their usefulness to the cause of the proletarian revolution, and their proletarian revolutionary nature. Therefore, on the day of October 1917, when history summed up all the past revolutionary struggles, when history weighed the weight of the various parties in the internal struggle of the working class on its own scales—the working class of the Soviet Union made a final choice and stood on the side of the only proletarian party, the Communist Party." ("Leninism Problems," Russian text, tenth edition, page 182).
    This is the greatest victory of the Bolshevik Party and its progressive thought—Marxism-Leninism.
    II
    The invincible Bolshevik ideology was particularly evident in the struggle of the party of Lenin and Stalin for the victory of the socialist revolution and for the victory of establishing socialism in the Soviet Union.
    The Great October Socialist Revolution opened a new era in human history. It paved the way for the country's productive forces to move towards unprecedented prosperity and towards the establishment of a socialist society. It was not only revolutionary in economic and political relations. As Comrade Stalin pointed out, "It is also an intellectual revolution, a revolution in the thinking of the working class." ("Leninism Problems," Russian text, eleventh edition, page 180)
    In the process of establishing a new socialist life, the Soviet people further understood Marxist-Leninist thought, and at the same time accepted these thoughts and the policies of the Bolshevik Party based on them, which expressed their own immediate interests.
    In the period from the victory of the October Revolution to the liquidation of the oppressive classes in the Soviet Union, socialist relations had been established in the struggle against the hostile forces of the class enemy.
    The enemies of Leninism—the Trotskyites and Bukharinites—were determined to pull the Party and the working class away from the road of Lenin, and frantically opposed the Bolshevik Party's line of rebuilding the socialist people's economy. They used every means to make the masses distrust the Party's strength and the possibility of establishing socialism in the Soviet Union. They used the most despicable means to undermine the Party's policies and prepare the conditions for restoring capitalism in our country.
    The Party, under the leadership of Comrade Stalin, shattered the despicable Menshevik and Trotskyist theories aimed at disarming the working class. Comrade Stalin defended and further developed Lenin's doctrine on the victory of socialism in one country, and pointed out the path to establishing socialism in the Soviet Union.
    Based on the teachings of Lenin and Stalin, the Bolshevik Party mobilized all labor forces to build socialism. Not afraid of intimidation and threats, the Party, under the leadership of Comrade Stalin, bravely and indomitably, carefully and meticulously guided the Soviet people forward, not conforming to backwardness, not afraid of going against the tide, crushing all difficulties in reaching the destination, and always maintaining its position of leadership. Without this steadfastness and patience, the Party could not have persisted in the policy of national industrialization and the collectivization of agricultural economy; it could not have realized the transformation of social relations, which in its depth and thoroughness is unparalleled in the past history of mankind.
    Now, everyone understands that the Bolshevik struggle against the enemies of Leninism was a struggle to build a strong socialist industrial and collective agricultural power that could withstand any attack by the enemy. At the same time, this was also a struggle to clear the Bolshevik line, to consolidate Leninism's position in the working class, and to call on the working peasants to participate in socialist construction. This struggle won a complete victory, which was consolidated by the Stalin Constitution.
    Comrade Stalin's theoretical works have played the greatest significance in obtaining this victory, first and foremost his "On the Foundations of Leninism," which provides a great exposition and profound theoretical foundation for Leninism, and unearths the new and special things that Lenin brought to the development of Marxist theory. Comrade Stalin's classic work has become a powerful ideological weapon for the Bolsheviks.
    On the road to building socialism, the Soviet people have suffered countless hardships and no small losses. But they were not discouraged, because they were armed with the great ideas of Lenin and Stalin, which inspired them to carry out the socialist transformation of their Soviet motherland, and they had unlimited confidence in the victory of the Bolshevik Party's Leninist and Stalinist policies.
    The victory of socialism has not only brought about profound changes in the domestic economy, but it has also shown a fundamental reform in the social class structure. The new dynamics of Soviet society—moral and political unity, Soviet patriotism, and the friendship of all nationalities—have been widely used and increasingly consolidated. Two great forces—the people and communism—are united as one.
    The creative development of Marxist-Leninist thought, namely Stalin's "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) Short Course," shows its own irresistible power and vitality in the entire historical process of the Party, and becomes the ideological master of the people's masses. The correctness of Marxism-Leninism has been affirmed by the entire process of modern history and the entire practice of socialist construction in the Soviet Union. After owning the masses, the Communist Party's ideology has turned into a powerful material force in the Soviet Union. The socialist society established in the Soviet Union and the Soviet state and social organizations were created in strict accordance with the genius plans of Lenin and Stalin. This triumph of Marxist-Leninist thought proves that they have great transforming power.
    The Soviet people's historic victory in the Great Patriotic War is a new brilliant proof of the unbreakable strength of the Soviet system in realizing the scientific theory of Marxism-Leninism. The world historical victory of the socialist state in the Great Patriotic War is the victory of Marxism-Leninism. The Soviet people not only inflicted a military defeat on fascism, but also a moral and political defeat. The great victory achieved in the Patriotic War is not only the military and economic strength of the Soviet state. The Marxist-Leninist ideology, the ideology of Soviet patriotism, and the Leninist-Stalinist ideology of equality and fraternity among all nationalities have all won.
    The Communist Party's program and its ideology that overcomes everything has become the cause of all Soviet people, all Bolsheviks—Party members and non-Party members—that are flesh and blood related.
    Fifty years ago, when Lenin and Stalin first established the Party, the number of their like-minded people was small, but now, the great ideas of Marxism-Leninism have become the banner of millions of people around the world. In the past, Communist Party members always harbored a little suspicion about exchanges with non-Party members, because the slogan of non-party affiliation could often conceal various bourgeois groups who did not benefit from wearing a mask. But now, Comrade Stalin says: Our era is different. "Non-Party members are now separated from the bourgeoisie by a fence called the Soviet social system. But this fence also unites non-Party members and Communist Party members into a common collective of Soviet people. When they live in this common collective, they fight together to consolidate the strength of our country; they fight together on the front line for the freedom and greatness of our motherland, shed blood together; they forge together, and forge our country's victory over the enemy."
    In the current stage of historical development, socialism has become the agenda of all nationalities' lives. Laboring people all over the world who are seeking their own path to liberation have drawn more answers to the fundamental questions that excite them in the great teachings of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin. The ideas of Marxism-Leninism, under the banner of the Communist Party, have united millions of progressive people around the world and have become a powerful spiritual weapon in their struggle. Stalin's brilliant works have taken root in the hearts of fighters for democracy, peace, and freedom, giving fighters for socialism confidence in their own strength. Recalling, for example, the political conclusions drawn from the theory of materialist dialectics, it is very clear how powerful a weapon of struggle Comrade Stalin has given to communists all over the world.
    Dialectics teaches us that the world is in constant development, and the death of the old and the growth of the new is the law of development. This means that the system of private property and class exploitation is not permanent, and it may be replaced by the socialist system. This means that we should stand on the position of those social classes that are developing and have prospects for the future, and "in order not to make mistakes in politics, we must look forward, not backward." The growth of the influence of the Communist Party, which has become a progressive fighter abroad, is not an accident, but a completely legal phenomenon. Dialectics says that development arises from internal contradictions and the conflict of opposing forces based on these contradictions. From this comes the most important political conclusion that class struggle in an exploiting society is inevitable; we should not block the contradictions of capitalism, as modern reformists—right-wing social democrats—do, but "discover and unleash them, not stifle class struggle, but complete it thoroughly," not implement a policy of equal sharing of interests between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat, but implement an indomitable class policy of the proletariat.
    Marxism-Leninism is a vibrant and invincible doctrine. Consider what Comrade Stalin said at the 17th Congress of the CPSU(B) in January 1934 to those bourgeois reactionary theorists who believed that Marxism had been eliminated in some countries in the West. "Marxism is the scientific expression of the fundamental interests of the working class. To eliminate Marxism, it is necessary to eliminate the working class. But to eliminate the working class is fundamentally impossible. More than eighty years have passed since Marxism appeared on the stage. During this period, dozens and hundreds of bourgeois governments have attempted to eliminate Marxism. But what is the result? Bourgeois governments have risen and fallen, and Marxism still stands tall. And Marxism has achieved complete victory in one-sixth of the world's land, and has even achieved victory in countries where it is believed that Marxism has been completely eliminated." ("Leninism Problems," Russian text, eleventh edition, page 484.)
    Stalin's prophetic words have become a call inspiring workers to be steadfastly loyal to the ever-victorious banner of Marxism-Leninism.
    III
    The great task of further building a communist society requires full engagement in education, especially to increase the dissemination among the masses of the ideas of life that Marxism-Leninism can provide. In the era of completing socialist construction and gradually transitioning from socialism to communism, the role of consciousness as a powerful factor in further movement has increased even more. Socialist consciousness accelerates the development of Soviet society, increases its strength, and expands its sources. Therefore, the Party is eager for the working people's consciousness and political activism to continue to increase; eager for Communist Party members to always act as the advanced and conscious ranks of the working people; and to stand at the pinnacle of their own tasks as the leaders and hosts of the Soviet people and their struggle for communism.
    The resolution of the Central Committee of the CPSU(B) on the issue of ideological work—on the magazines "Star" and "Leningrad," on the film "A Bright Life," etc.—with new strength instructs all Bolsheviks to pay attention to further improving the political and theoretical level of our cadres.
    However, a small number of Party members and Soviet staff members are still not making progress in their development, and are limiting themselves to the small circles of organizational and economic work. They are only interested in international and domestic life issues, and have forgotten the most basic obligation of the Bolsheviks, which is to tirelessly improve their ideological and political level. As a result, a small number of people, including individual leading staff members of Soviet organs, have become unprincipled bureaucrats, lost their Bolshevik face, and become intolerable good-natured people, losing their vigilance. This type of staff members will quickly be infected with an atmosphere of complacency and self-satisfaction, which is a frequent phenomenon resulting from low ideological and political levels.
    In order to successfully realize the great tasks put forward by the Party and the Soviet state, our cadres—Bolsheviks who are Party members and non-Party members, Soviet staff members and economic staff members, workers on the scientific and cultural front—should be permeated with Bolshevik ideology, thoroughly understand the Party's political line, master its political and organizational experience, learn to master the direction in the complex international environment, gradually approach the tasks put forward by the Soviet people in politics, and understand how to lead with Marxist-Leninist doctrine in their daily life practice. The task of our cadres is to be vigilant before the encirclement of capitalism, to know how to distinguish and expose the enemy's propaganda conspiracies, to fight against all phenomena of foreign flattery, and to cultivate the feeling of pride in their own socialist motherland in every Soviet person.
    "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) Short Course" is a powerful tool for understanding the laws of social development; it is the scientific basis for solving the practical tasks of economic and cultural construction. This book, created by Comrade Stalin on the eve of World War II, played a great role in the ideological training of our cadres. In this creation of Stalin, the Bolsheviks gained a full understanding of the laws of social development; gained an understanding of the historical inevitability of the victory of our great cause, and confidence in defeating fascism. The scientific history of the CPSU(B) has inspired them in the struggle to build communism in our country.
    The resolution of the Central Committee of the CPSU(B) on the Party's propaganda program on November 14, 1938, stated: "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) Short Course" is the most important tool for solving the task of understanding Bolshevism and arming Party members with Marxist-Leninist theory, that is, knowledge of the laws of social development and political struggle; it is a tool for raising the political vigilance of Party members and non-Party Bolsheviks; it is a tool for carrying out Marxist-Leninist propaganda work at a high theoretical level.
    "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) Short Course" expounds and summarizes the great experience of the Bolshevik Party, and provides a complete narrative of the theoretical basis of Marxism-Leninism based on historical facts. Studying "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) Short Course" can help understand the basics of Marxism-Leninism, master the historical experience of our Party, and increase the courage to conduct in-depth research on the works of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin.
    Stalin's work is a chronicle of the great victories of the Bolshevik Party. It armed, enlightened, and illuminated new prospects with brilliant brilliance in the struggle for new victories. It tells that the Bolshevik Party is the party of transformers and innovators, the party of true patriots of the motherland, the sole expression of the interests of the working class and the fundamental interests of the working people. Studying "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) Short Course" can cultivate Soviet people's Soviet patriotism and feelings of Soviet national pride; can cultivate love for the socialist motherland and for their own people; and can cultivate love for the Party that created the great socialist country under the leadership of Stalin and Lenin.
    "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) Short Course" narrates historical facts and theoretical positions that are closely related to the objective situation and the specific tasks of the political struggle of the working class. It educates us in Bolshevik leadership techniques with concrete historical images, and educates us in mastering and creatively applying Marxist-Leninist theory to the specific conditions of each suitable period and struggle. "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) Short Course" educates us to solve current tasks and maintain and increase contact with the masses.
    Comrade Stalin's classic work armed and enriched communists all over the world with the great experience of the CPSU(B), and helped them enlighten their own struggles with the light of scientific socialist consciousness. In this work, they can learn from the examples of the Bolsheviks' struggle against all enemies, which are vivid examples of fearlessness, perseverance, knowing how to overcome difficulties, defeating enemies, and realizing the great ideals of scientific socialism.

　　马列主义思想的宝藏
    ——纪念“联共（布）党史简明教程”出版十周年
    钉斯列波夫作  宋恩泽译
    一九三八年十月一日，斯大林同志的经典劳作“联共（布）党史简明教程”问世了。这部创造性的马列主义的优秀作品，异常深刻地阐明了社会发展规律。它从科学上、从理论上、综合了布尔塞维克党伟大的历史经验，这个党过去和现在都是世界上还没有一个政党所能与其媲美的。
    “联共（布）党史简明教程”明确地画出了一幅布尔塞维克党为社会主义革命的胜利、为社会主义的胜利而进行的英勇斗争的画图。党的历史，是和经济、阶级相互关系及国际情况中的变化联系起来谈的。
    在斯大林这部劳作中，全面地阐明了布尔塞维克党的意识形态、组织、政治和理论的准备的特征。布尔塞维克党的历史，是作为列宁学说发展史来谈的；以行动来说明了马列主义。
    “联共（布）党史简明教程”，是马列主义基本知识的百科全书。其中说明了列宁和斯大林带给马克思主义的新东西。列宁和斯大林以帝国主义阶段，资本主义发展规律的最深刻分析为基础，创造了无产阶级革命的完整理论，以及用社会主义可能在一国之中得到胜利的学说武装了工人阶级。在斯大林这部书中精巧地证明，无产阶级革命，怎样通过那以苏维埃——世界上最民主的政权——为其国家形式的无产阶级专政，而成为血肉之躯。以庞大的历史资料，说明了民族问题、农民问题以及列宁和斯大林的战略与策略问题的布尔塞维克主义的解决方法，就是关于无产阶级领导阶级斗争的科学，并且也就是全面发展了的马列主义的政党学说。“联共（布）党史简明教程”中，包括着马列主义哲学思想登峰造极之作的斯大林同志的天才作品“论辩证唯物主义与历史唯物主义”。文中，将辩证唯物主义发展为共产主义的理论基础，发展为布尔塞维克党的世界观。说明马列主义哲学的理论立场的时候，是和党的实践活动密切联系着的。
    联共（布）的科学历史，证明列宁和斯大林在各个不同的党的历史时期中，归纳了历史事实，并且勇敢地将马克思主义理论推向前去，铺设了许多新的道路，并和教条主义进行无情的斗争。“联共（布）党史简明教程”是马列主义学说强大改造力量的显明证据。千百万人的心上都怀抱着伟大的理想，因此而加强着苏维埃人对于共产主义必定彻底胜利的信念。
    一
    早在布尔塞维克主义摇篮时期，列宁和斯大林即已提出一项任务：使社会主义的意识形态在工人运动中生根。在最复杂的环境中无畏地克服了数不清的困难时，列宁和斯大林就在工人小组中组成了布尔塞维克党。他们操心地征集和教育干部，武装他们的思想，在反对工人阶级一切敌人的严酷斗争中锻炼他们。他们以马列主义理论永不熄灭的明灯启发了劳动者的政治斗争。
    马列主义学说具有着能够战胜一切的力量。在历史上，那些企图指出社会发展道路和画出未来图景的各种理论，曾经提出了许多。但这些都不是科学的理论，不是与群众的生活及斗争联在一起的理论，是没有发掘社会发展真正规律的理论，所以它们结果成了书生之见，而不能拥有群众。
    马列主义真实地反映出社会物质生活发展的要求。它的结论和规律是以实生活为根据，并由它而出发的。马列主义是工人阶级基本利益的科学表现。这就是无产阶级的伟大学说。它一天一天地巩固和发展，它对于群众的影响，也在不断地增加。
    列宁主义——帝国主义和无产阶级革命时代的马克思主义——是一九○三至一九一七年这时期工人运动的思潮之一。它为自己铺设了一条与小资产阶级的政党和思潮——孟塞维克、社会革命党人、无政府主义者及形形色色的机会主义者——进行残酷斗争的群众道路。在这斗争中，党不屈不挠地保卫着它自己最伟大的财产——她的思想财产，她的思想行李。
    斯大林同志以生动的话画出了劳动人们的领袖和导师列宁的伟大形象。“联共（布）党史简明教程”以磅礴大力指出，列宁怎样以新的规律丰富了马克思主义，以及列宁反抗革命的马克思主义的敌人的出卖而保全了对于党是多么伟大的思想财富。列宁在“做什么？”一书中，发展了党的思想基础；在“进一步，退两步”一文中，发展了党的组织基础；在“社会民主党在民主革命中的两个策略”一书中，并发展了党的策略基础；在那时对于布尔塞维克党的教育有着决定性意义的作品“唯物主义和经验批判主义”中，发展了党的理论基础。
    列宁在研究党的学说方面的忠实和优秀战友，是斯大林同志。早在布尔塞维克主义初显光芒的时候，斯大林同志即已写了许多理论著作——“略论党的意见不和”，“无产者的和无产者的党”，“无政府主义呢，还是社会主义？”等等——，在这些著作中，马克思主义政党的基础有了辉煌的澄清和发展。斯大林这些作品成为马列主义财宝中的伟大贡献。
    列宁和斯大林的理论作品教育了，并且在思想上锻炼了工人阶级的党。在列宁和斯大林所发展的革命思想中，工人阶级和劳动群众，过去看见，现在也看见了他们切身利益与斗争目的的科学的反映，而代表他们所创造的布尔塞维克党的，则是他们自己的干练领袖与导师。
    为马、恩、列、斯学说所武装的党，领导工人阶级和一切劳动者通过了三次革命的熔炉。第一次俄国革命失败以后黑暗反动时期中最困难的条件，没有能粉碎布尔塞维克党，当时布尔塞维克党的组织，照斯大林同志的意思说，事实上是象海洋似的被取消派、革命叛徒们所散布的绝望和无信心包围着。
    在警察疯狂迫害的条件之下，党在自己口号周围把群众团结起来。紧张准备无产阶级取得政权的斗争时，布尔塞维克党在第一次革命高潮时期中，重新证明她自己有顺利领导工人阶级斗争的才能。
    布尔塞维克是第一次世界大战时期唯一能忠实于革命和毫不动摇地高举国际主义战斗旗帜、高举反对帝国主义战争的坚决斗争旗帜的政党。
    在准备伟大十月社会主义革命的复杂时期中，各种事件不断发展，随时随地都要布尔塞维克拿出勇敢和巧妙的策略，这时候，列宁和斯大林的党，展开了伟大工作：它把劳动群众结合起来，在政治上教育他们，以及动员他们到自己的口号周围来。党以诞生伟大群众力量的伟大目的武装了群众。
    布尔塞维克党把苏维埃祖国，从威胁着她的大灾难中，从国外帝国主义精神和物质的奴役中拯救出来。她以自己彻底和贤明的政策争取到了革命群众，组织起了工人阶级战胜敌人的成果。苏维埃国家内所有其他企图领导劳动者的政党，都在政治上彻底破产了。伟大十月社会主义革命具有决定意义的特性之一，就是它是在一个政党——共产党——总的领导的标记之下进行的。
    斯大林同志说：“自一九○三年至一九一七年十月这一段时期，是我国工人阶级意见上的残酷斗争时期，是在布尔塞维克、孟塞维克、社会革命党人之间进行影响工人阶级的斗争时期。在这时期中，苏联的工人阶级经过了三次革命。在这些革命的火中，他们考验和检定了这些政党、它们对无产阶级革命事业的用处、它们的无产阶级革命性。所以，到了一九一七年十月的日子，当历史总结所有过去的革命斗争时，当历史以自己的天秤来衡量工人阶级内部斗争各政党的比重时，——苏联的工人阶级举行了最后的选择，而站到唯一的无产阶级政党共产党方面去了。”（列宁主义问题”，俄文本第十版，页一八二）。
    这是布尔塞维克党及其进步思想——马列主义——的最伟大胜利。
    二
    在着攻无不克之力的布尔塞维克主义思想，在列宁和斯大林的党为争取社会主义革命胜利、为争取在苏联建立社会主义胜利的斗争过程中，表现得特别明白。
    伟大十月社会主义革命，开启了人类历史上的新纪元。它铺设了一条使国家的生产力走向空前繁荣、走向建立社会主义社会的大道。她不仅在经济和政治关系上是革命的。斯大林同志指出，“她同时是智力上的革命，工人阶级思想上的革命。”（“列宁主义问题”，俄文本第十一版，页一八○）
    有建立新的社会主义生活过程中，苏联人民更加理解了马列主义思想，同时接受了这些思想和以此为基础的、表现他们自己切身利益的布尔塞维克党的政策。
    在十月革命胜利之后到清算苏联国内压迫阶级这段时期，社会主义的关系已在和阶级敌对势力的斗争中确定了。
    列宁主义的敌人——托洛斯基分子和布哈林分子——一心要把党和工人阶级从列宁的大路上拉开，疯狂反对布尔塞维克党改建社会主义人民经济的路线。他们不择手段地使群众不相信党的力量，不相信在苏联国内建立社会主义的可能性。他们运用出最卑鄙的手段来破坏党的政策，以及准备在我们国内恢复资本主义的条件。
    在斯大林同志领导下的党，粉碎了目的在解除工人阶级武装的卑鄙的孟塞维克和托洛斯基派的理论。斯大林同志保卫和进一步发展了列宁关于社会主义能在一国中胜利学说，指出了在苏联建立社会主义的道路。
    以列宁和斯大林的学说为基础，布尔塞维克党动员了一切劳动力量来建设社会主义。不怕恐吓与威胁，党在斯大林同志领导下，勇敢和不屈不挠地，慎重而细心地引导苏维埃人民前进，不顺应落后，不怕走逆流，粉碎到达目的地中的一切困难，以及随时保持自己领导力量的地位。没有这种坚强和忍耐，党就不能坚持国家工业化和农业经济集体化的政策；就不能实现那在深度及彻底性上是人类过去历史中找不到与之匹敌的社会关系的改建。
    现在，每个人都明白，布尔塞维克对列宁主义的敌人所进行的斗争，是为了要建立能够支持敌人任何进攻的强大社会主义工业及集体农业强国的斗争。同时这也是为扫清布尔塞维克路线、为巩固列宁主义在工人阶级中的地位、为号召劳动农民参加社会主义建设的斗争，这斗争获得了斯大林宪法所巩固起来的完全胜利。
    斯大林同志的理论作品，在这胜利的获得中，有着最伟大的意义，这首先是他的“关于列宁主义的基础”，其中对于列宁主义提出了伟大的阐述和深刻的理论基础，并且发掘了列宁在发展马克思理论中所带来的新东西和特殊东西。斯大林同志的这部经典作品，成了布尔塞维克强有力的思想武器。
    在建立社会主义的道路上，苏维埃人民曾受到无数的艰难和不小的损失。但他们并未垂头丧气，因为他们是被列宁和斯大林的伟大思想所武装的，这思想感应他们在进行他们苏维埃祖国的社会主义改造工作，并且他们对于布尔塞维克党的列宁和斯大林政策的胜利，具有无限的信心。
    社会主义的胜利，不仅使国内的经济起了深刻变化，而且它本身就显示出社会阶级构造的根本改革。苏维埃社会的新动力，——道德政治的一致、苏维埃的爱国主义、各民族的友谊——被广泛运用，并且日益巩固了。两个伟大的力量——人民与共产主义——结为一个整体。
    马列主义思想的创造发展，就是斯大林的“联共（布）党史简明教程”，党的全部历史过程，显出了它自己不可衡抗的力量与活力，以及成为人民群众思想上的支配者。马列主义的正确性，被现代历史的全部过程、苏联的社会主义建设的全部实践所肯定了。共产党的思想，拥有了群众之后，就在苏联国内变为强大的物质力量了。在苏联建立的社会主义社会，苏维埃的国家和社会组织，是确切遵照列宁与斯大林的天才计划而创立的，这个马列主义思想的凯旋，证明它们是有着伟大的改造力量的。
    苏维埃人民在伟大卫国战争中的历史性胜利，是实现马列主义科学理论的苏维埃制度坚不可破的力量的新的光辉证明。社会主义国家在伟大卫国战争中获得的世界历史性胜利，就是马列主义的胜利。苏维埃人民不仅予法西斯主义以军事的失败，而且也予以道德和政治上的失败。在卫国战争中所获得的伟大胜利，不单是苏维埃国家的军事和经济力量的。马列主义的意识形态，苏维埃爱国主义的意识形态，各民族平等友爱的列宁斯大林式的意识形态，都获得了胜利。
    共产党的纲领及其战胜一切的思想，成为所有苏维埃人民，所有布尔塞维克——党员和非党员——血肉相关的事业。
    五十年前，当列宁和斯大林刚刚建立了党的时候，他们志同道合的人数是不大的，而现在，马列主义的伟大思想已经是千百万人们的旗帜了。从前共产党员对非党员往来总怀着一点怀疑，因为无党无派的口号，常常可以隐瞒各种各样不带假面具就对他没有什么好处的资产阶级集团。但现在，斯大林同志说：我们的时代不同了。“非党员现在是被那称为苏维埃社会制度的栅栏遮住而和资产阶级隔开了。但这栅栏又把非党员和共产党员团结在苏维埃人的一个共同的集体之中。他们生活在这个共同的集体中的时候，他们一同为巩固我们国家的力量而斗争；他们为了我们祖国的自由和伟大，在前线上一同作战，一同流血；他们一同铸造，并且铸成了我们国家对敌人的胜利。”
    在历史发展的现阶段中，社会主义成为各民族的生活日程，拔寻自己解放之路的全世界劳动人民，在马、恩、列、斯的伟大学说中对于那些使他们兴奋的根本问题吸取了更多的答案。马列主义的思想，在共产党的旗帜下，团结了全世界千百万进步人民，并且成为他们斗争中强大的精神武器。斯大林的天才作品，在民主、和平、自由事业的战士心上生了根，使社会主义事业的战士，对自己的力量有了信心。回想一下，例如，从唯物主义辩证法的理论得出来的政治结论，就很显明，斯大林同志把多么强大的斗争武器，给了全世界的共产主义者。
    辩证法教训我们，世界是在不断的发展中，旧的死去和新的生长是发展的规律。这就是说，私有财产制度和阶级剥削，不是永久如一的，它可能用社会主义制度来代替。这就是说，应当站在那些正在发展和未来有前途的社会阶层的立场上，要“不在政治上犯错误，必需往前看，而不应该往后看”。在国外成为进步战士的共产党的影响的增长并不是偶然的，而是完全合于法则的现象。辩证法说，发展产生于内部矛盾及以这矛盾为基础的对立力量的冲突。由此就得出了最重要的政治结论，剥削社会中的阶级斗争，是必然现象；不应当象现代的改良主义者——右翼社会党人——所做的那样，去堵塞资本主义的矛盾，而是“要发现并掀起它们，不要窒息阶级斗争，而要彻底完成它”，不要执行资产阶级和无产阶级利益均沾的改良政策，而要执行无产阶级不屈不挠的阶级政策。
    马列主义学说是富有活力与胜过一切的。想一想斯大林同志在一九三四年一月联共（布）十七次代表大会上，对那些认为西方某几国中的马克思主义已经被消灭的资产阶级反动理论家所说的话。“马克思主义是工人阶级基本利益的科学表现。要消灭马克思主义，必需消灭工人阶级。但要消灭工人阶级，这是根本不可能的。从马克思主义出现于舞台，到现在已八十多年了。在这段期间，几十几百的资产阶级政府，曾企图消灭马克思主义。可是结果怎样呢？资产阶级政府此起彼复，而马克思主义依然屹立无恙。并且马克思主义在世界六分之一的土地上已经得到完全胜利，甚至在那认为马克思主义已经彻底消灭了的国家中，也得到了胜利。”（“列宁主义问题”，俄文本十一版，页四八四。）
    斯大林这种预言般的话，成为感应劳动者坚定不移地忠实于马列主义的常胜旗帜的号召。
    三
    进一步建设共产主义社会的伟大任务，要求全力从事教育工作，尤其要在群众中加大普及马列主义所能给予一切的生命的思想。在完成社会主义建设及从社会主义渐渐过渡到共产主义的时代，作为进一步运动的强大因素的意识的作用有了更大的增涨。社会主义的自觉意识，加速了苏维埃社会的发展，加多了他的力量及壮大的泉源。所以，党热望劳动者的自觉性及政治积极性不断提高；热望共产党员时时刻刻要作为劳动者前进的、自觉的队伍；作为苏联人民及其为共产主义的斗争中的领导者和主持人，而站在他们自己任务的顶点上。
    联共（布）中央委员会对于意识工作问题的决议——论“星”与“列宁格勒”杂志，论电影“灿烂的生活”等等——以新的力量指示所有布尔塞维克注意进一步提高我们干部的政治和理论水准。
    然而，有少数党员和苏维埃工作人员，还是在他们的发展中不长进，而把自己局限在组织工作及经济工作的小圈子中，他们只对国际和国内生活的问题发生兴趣，而忘掉了布尔塞维克最基本的义务，是不倦地提高自己的思想及政治水准。结果就有少数人，包括苏维埃机关各个个别领导工作人员，成了毫无原则的事务工作者，丧失了布尔塞维克的面孔，变为难于叫人容忍的好好先生，失去了戒心。这一类工作人员，很快就会染上自满和自慰的气息，这种自满和自慰正是由于低级思想和政治水准而结果造成的一种经常现象。
    为了顺利实现党和苏维埃国家提出的伟大任务，我们的干部——党员与非党员的布尔塞维克、苏维埃工作人员与经济工作人员，科学与文化战线上的工作者——应当渗透着布尔塞维克的思想，好好地理解党的政治路线，掌握它的政治和组织经验，在复杂的国际环境中学习掌握方向，在政治上逐步接近苏联人民所提出来的任务，在自己的日常生活实践中懂得以马列主义学说作领导。我们干部的任务，是要在资本主义的包围之前具有戒心，懂得辨别和揭发敌人的宣传阴谋，与一切媚外的现象斗争，培养每一位苏维埃人以自己社会主义祖国为骄傲的情感。
    “联共（布）党史简明教程”，是了解社会发展规律的有力工具；是解决经济和文化建设实践任务的科学基础。斯大林同志在第二次世界大战前夜所创作的这部书，对于我们干部的思想锻炼，起过极大的作用。在这部斯大林的创作中，布尔塞维克对于社会的发展规律，得到了充分的了解；获得了对于我们伟大事业的历史性的必胜的理解，对于战胜法西斯主义的信心。联共（布）的科学历史，为在我们国内建设共产主义的斗争上鼓舞了他们。
    一九三八年十一月十四日联共（布）中央委员会关于党的宣传方案的决议中说道：“联共（布）党史简明教程”是解决理解布尔塞维克主义以及以马列理论、即社会发展规律和政治斗争知识武装党员这一任务的最重要工具；是提高的和非党的布尔什维克政治警觉性的工具；是在高度理论水准上展开马列主义宣传工作的工具。
    “联共（布）党史简明教程”阐述和归纳了布尔塞维克党的伟大经验，并且根据历史事实，对于马列主义的理论基础作了完整的叙述。研究“联共（布）党史简明教程”，可以帮助理解马列主义的基础，精通我们党的历史经验，增涨对马、恩、列、斯作品作深刻研究的勇气。
    斯大林这部作品，是布尔塞维克党伟大胜利的编年史。它在为新胜利而进行的斗争上，以辉煌灿烂的光辉武装、开启、照耀了新的远景。它讲述布尔塞维克党，是改造者和革新者的党，是祖国真正的爱国者的党，是工人阶级的利益、劳动者的根本利益的唯一表现者。研究“联共（布）党史简明教程”，可以培养苏维埃人的苏维埃爱国主义与苏维埃民族骄傲的情感；可以培养对社会主义祖国、对自己人民的爱；可以培养在斯大林和列宁的领导下创造伟大社会主义国家的党的爱。
    “联共（布）党史简明教程”，叙述了与客观情况、与工人阶级政治斗争的具体任务有密切关系的历史事实和理论立场。它以具体的历史形象教育我们布尔塞维克的领导技术，教育我们精通创造地将马列主义理论运用到每一个适宜的时期、斗争的具体条件上去。“联共（布）党史简明教程”教育我们解决当前的任务，保持并增加与群众的联系。
    斯大林同志的经典作品，以联共（布）的伟大经验，武装和丰富了全世界的共产主义者，它以科学社会主义意识的灯光，帮助他们启发了自己的斗争。在这部作品中，他们可以学习布尔塞维克人反对所有敌人的斗争的范例，这些范例是大无畏、坚忍不拔、懂得克服困难、战胜敌人，实现科学社会主义伟大理想的活灵活现的例子。
