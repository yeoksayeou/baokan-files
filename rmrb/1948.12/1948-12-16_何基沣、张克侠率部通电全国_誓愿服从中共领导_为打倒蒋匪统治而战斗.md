Xinhua News Agency, East China, 13th -- Generals He Jifeng and Zhang Kexia, along with Deputy Commander Meng Zhaolian, Division Commanders Guo Jiafang, Cui Zhenlun, and Yang Gan, who led the uprising of two divisions of the 59th Army and one and a half divisions of the 77th Army of the Kuomintang forces north of Xuzhou on the 8th of last month, have issued a nationwide announcement with all officers and soldiers. The text of the telegram is as follows:

To Commander Chen, Political Commissar Rao, Deputy Commander Zhang, Deputy Commander Su, Political Commissar Tan, and forwarded to Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, Deputy Commander-in-Chief Peng, and all the Liberation Army, as well as compatriots from all walks of life throughout the country:

During the Northern Expeditionary Great Revolution period, the Northwest Army, under the leadership of Mr. Feng Yuxiang, adhered to Mr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings and the Three Great Policies of alliance with Russia, alliance with the Communist Party, and support for workers and peasants. This not only transformed a nearly failing force into a formidable army but also wrote a glorious page in the history of the Northwest Army by participating in the revolutionary Northern Expeditionary War. However, since the autumn of 1927, Chiang Kai-shek betrayed Mr. Sun's teachings, undermined the united front between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, colluded with imperialism externally, and relied on reactionary forces internally to carry out the anti-people "Communist Suppression" civil war. The various units of the Northwest Army were deceived by the Chiang bandits and placed under their despotic power, thus being forced to separate from the Communist Party and distance themselves from the people, resulting in serious political errors. Looking around the country, the Northwest Army has largely been annihilated, with very little remaining. Reflecting on the past and present, how can we not be filled with emotion? However, the past anti-communism and anti-people actions were by no means what all officers and soldiers desired, let alone what those with political foresight were willing to do. Therefore, there were successive uprisings by martyrs such as Dong Zhentang, Zhao Bosheng, and Ji Hongchang. After the War of Resistance Against Japan, many units also turned to the people. Our army, as a part of the former Northwest Army, although it failed to break away from the Chiang bandits earlier, when the Japanese invaders launched their war of aggression, the Chiang bandits retreated step by step in the face of the enemy. The vast majority of officers and soldiers of our army could no longer tolerate it and, disregarding the Chiang bandits' pro-Japanese intentions, responded to the will of the people and stepped forward to resist Japan at Lugou Bridge. Since then, we have endured hardships and persisted in the War of Resistance. Who would have thought that the Chiang bandits had ulterior motives, passively resisting the Japanese invaders while using every possible means to destroy and weaken non-direct line troops, even if they had contributed to the War of Resistance. Our troops, numbering more than 100,000, were divided and reorganized into just over ten regiments, still deemed insufficient. After the Japanese surrendered, the people's wounds had not yet healed, and the flames of civil war reignited. Disregarding the wishes of the people for recuperation and the efforts of the Chinese Communist Party to safeguard democracy and peace, relying solely on the aid of American imperialism, they brazenly launched a criminal war against the People's Liberation Army. The remaining ten-plus regiments of our Northwest Army were still feared and driven to the front lines of the civil war on the outskirts of Xuzhou, stationed in southern Shandong for more than two years, without replenishment of troops or ammunition. This conspiracy of the Chiang bandits chilled the hearts of the entire army. Now, the people of the whole country are turning to the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army, and the Chiang bandits' doom is imminent. In order to comply with the national situation, restore our original patriotic and pro-people aspirations, and continue to fight for the people's cause, at the firm and enthusiastic request of all 20,000 officers and soldiers, on November 8th, we resolutely staged an uprising in the defensive areas of Jiawang and Taierzhuang, north of Xuzhou, and joined the People's Liberation Army. From now on, we vow to rebuild our army into a people's army under the leadership of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, based on the principles of the People's Liberation Army and the various policies and propositions stated in the People's Liberation Army Declaration, to fight for the expulsion of American imperialism and the overthrow of the Kuomintang reactionaries, the common enemy of the people. In order to establish a unified national democratic coalition government as soon as possible, we will strive for national independence, democratic freedom, people's livelihood, and the complete liberation of the people of the whole country, realizing the unfinished legacy of Mr. Sun Yat-sen, the late Commander-in-Chief Feng, and all revolutionary martyrs, and comforting the ardent expectations of the people of the whole country for our army. At the beginning of the uprising, when the troops are being reorganized and awaiting orders, we hereby issue a nationwide announcement to inform compatriots from all walks of life, hoping for more guidance. To our former colleagues and comrades in the military, our army is willing to offer sincere advice. At this time when the revolutionary torrent is sweeping the country, those who comply with the people will prosper, and those who go against the people will perish. For the sake of the country, the nation, and personal prospects, rather than repeating the mistakes of Wang Yaowu and Huang Botao, it is better to learn from the righteous actions of Wu Huawen and Zeng Zesheng, or follow the example of Zheng Dongguo and Sun Liangcheng in leading their troops to surrender, so as to obtain the leniency of the people and avoid the punishment of the people. If one truly performs meritorious deeds in the uprising, rather than engaging in speculation and opportunism with ulterior motives, then one will surely be loved by the people. Our army's history is clear evidence of this. Moreover, today, the Chiang bandits' rule is facing collapse, and the victory of the national revolution is just around the corner. Time is of the essence, and the opportunity will be lost if not seized. Therefore, we hope that all patriotic individuals in the Kuomintang army will stage an uprising with their troops as soon as possible, or follow the example of Zheng Dongguo and lead their troops to surrender as soon as possible, so as to shorten the time of the revolutionary war. Light and darkness, new life and destruction, what to choose, decide quickly. We hereby send this telegram, respectfully hoping for your understanding.

He Jifeng, Zhang Kexia, Meng Zhaolian, Guo Jiafang, Cui Zhenlun, Yang Gan and all officers and soldiers respectfully salute.
November 28th

　　何基沣、张克侠率部通电全国
  　誓愿服从中共领导
    为打倒蒋匪统治而战斗
    【新华社华东十三日电】上月八日在徐州以北率领国民党军五十九军两个师、七十七军一个半师起义的副司令何基沣、张克侠两将军及副军长孟昭濂、师长过家芳、崔振纶、杨干三等，顷率全体官兵通电全国。电文如下：
    陈司令员、饶政委、张副司令员、粟副司令员、谭副政委，转毛主席、朱总司令、彭副总司令暨全体解放军，并全国各界同胞鉴：
    西北军在北伐大革命时期，在冯玉祥先生领导之下，曾奉行孙中山先生遗教，及联俄、联共、扶植工农三大政策，不仅使几濒于危的部队，当时跃为劲旅，抑且因参加革命的北伐战争，而写下西北军的光荣史迹。乃自民国十六年秋，由于蒋介石背叛孙先生遗教，破坏国共联合战线，对外勾结帝国主义，对内凭借反动势力，进行反人民之“剿共”内战，西北军各部为蒋贼欺骗，并处其淫威之下，遂亦被迫与中共分手，远离人民，铸成严重政治错误。环顾国内，今日西北军已大部覆灭，所剩无几，抚今追昔，能不感慨系之？但过去反共、反人民，决非全体官兵所愿为、更非有政治远见者所甘心，故先后有董振堂、赵博生、吉鸿昌诸先烈之起义。抗战以后，亦有许多部分归顺人民。本军为过去西北军之一部分，虽未能早日脱离蒋贼，但当日寇发动侵略战争之初，蒋贼在敌人面前，节节后退，本军广大官兵，忍无可忍，曾不顾蒋贼媚日意旨，顺应人心，在芦沟桥挺身抗日。此后含辛茹苦，坚持抗战。谁意蒋贼别具心肝，对日寇则消极抵抗，对非嫡系部队，则纵使抗日有功，亦将其摧残削弱，无所不用其极。以我部队十余万之众，竟划编为十余个团犹以为不足，当日寇投降后，人民之疮痍未复，而内战之烽烟又起。既不顾全国人民休养生息之愿望，复不顾中共维护民主和平之努力，仅恃美帝之援助，甘冒大不韪，向人民解放军发动罪恶的战争。对我西北军仅剩之十余团部队，仍惟恐其存在，复又驱迫走上徐州外围的内战前线，陈师鲁南两年有余，兵不为补，弹不为给。蒋贼此种阴谋，全军为之寒心。时当今日，举国人民归向中共与人民解放军，蒋贼大势已去，复没之期即在眼前。本军为顺应全国国情，恢复过去爱国爱民初衷，继续为人民事业而奋斗，在全体两万余官兵坚决热烈要求下，爰于十一月八日，在徐州以北贾汪台儿庄防地毅然举行起义，加入人民解放军。今后誓愿在中共中央领导之下，根据人民解放军的宗旨及人民解放军宣言所示各种政策与主张，重建本军为人民军队，为驱逐美帝国主义，打倒人民公敌国民党反动派而战斗。以期早日成立全国统一的民主联合政府，为民族独立、民主自由、民生幸福及全国人民的彻底解放而努力，实现孙先生冯故总司令及诸革命先烈未竟之遗志，而慰全国人民对本军之殷望。兹当起义之初，部队整顿待命之时，特通电全国，奉告各界同胞，尚望多予指导。对我旧日同僚，军界同仁，本军愿作诚挚之进言。处此革命巨浪席卷全国之际，顺民者昌，逆民者亡。为国家民族与个人前途计，与其蹈王耀武、黄伯韬的覆辙，不如学吴化文曾泽生等的举义，或效郑洞国、孙良诚等率部投诚，尚可获得人民的宽容，免受人民的惩处。如真举义有功，并非投机取巧，别有企图，则必可获人民之爱护。本军历史，即为明证。何况今日蒋贼统治已面临崩溃，全国革命胜利指日可期。时机紧迫，稍纵即逝。故望国民党军队中一切爱国志士，早日率部起义，其他则如郑洞国榜样早日率部投降。借以缩短革命战争时间。光明与黑暗，新生与灭亡，何去何从，速为决择。谨此电达，敬希亮察。
    何基丰、张克侠、孟昭濂、过家芳、崔振纶、杨干三率全体官兵同叩
    　　　　　　　　　十一月二十八日
