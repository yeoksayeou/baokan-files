Xinhua News Agency, Hebei-Chahar-Liaoning Border Region, 30th - After the liberation of Chengde on the 12th, all middle and primary schools in the city fully reopened on the 16th. The city originally had three secondary schools: a boys' middle school, a girls' middle school, and a normal school; five public complete primary schools; and one public and one private Hui complete primary school. When the Kuomintang bandit troops fled, the faculty and staff of each school spontaneously organized to protect the schools, waiting quietly for the democratic government to enter the city and take over. After the democratic government entered the city, it immediately cooperated with the original faculty and staff of each school to actively carry out the work of reopening schools. The government issued temporary start-up funds of 300,000 yuan to each secondary school and 200,000 yuan to each complete primary school. The two Hui public and private complete primary schools are about to merge and move back to the old site previously forcibly occupied by the Kuomintang bandit gang's "Provincial Training Corps". The government also issued 300,000 yuan in start-up funds to the school. After the reopening of the primary schools, many school-age children who could not afford to attend school under the rule of the Chiang bandits have signed up for enrollment one after another.

　　承德学校全部复课
    【新华社冀察熟辽三十日电】承德于十二日解放后，全市各中、小学十六日即全部复课。该市原有中等学校男中、女中、师范三所，公立完全小学五所，及公私立回民完全小学各一所。在国民党匪军逃窜时，各校教职员均自动组织起来保护学校，静待民主政府入城接管。民主政府入城后即会同各校原有教职员积极进行复课工作，并由政府发给中等学校每校临时开办费三十万元，完小每校二十万元。回民公私立两完小即将合并，迁回前被国民党匪帮“省训团”强占的旧址。政府亦发给该校三十万元开办费。各小学复课后，许多过去在蒋匪统治下无钱求学的学龄儿童，纷纷报名入学。
