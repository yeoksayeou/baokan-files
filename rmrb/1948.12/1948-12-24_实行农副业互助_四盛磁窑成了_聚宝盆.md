　　Implementing Mutual Aid in Agriculture and Sideline Occupations
    Si Sheng Ciyao Becomes a "Treasure Trove"
    [Taihang News] The agricultural and sideline mutual aid pottery kiln led by Guo Shengwang in Qingliu Village, Huguan County, has developed and been supported by its members due to government support, democratic leadership and management, and reasonable profit sharing. Before the war, this village was a village with developed pottery industry, but it was devastated and closed down during the Japanese occupation. After liberation in August 1945, it was restored with the support of a certain regiment of the People's Liberation Army. Later, due to the transfer of the troops, the pottery kiln was given to the workers to operate independently. Later, they obtained a loan of 20,000 yuan from the government. Together with the wages earned in the past, they collected a total of seven shi and seven dou of rice and bought the Si Sheng pottery kiln. It officially started work in February 1946. At this time, a total of 18 households invested, with a total of four sets of pottery wheels for making bowls, and 21 workers. Guo Shengwang was elected as the group leader by public vote. Because the workers received assistance from the government and started their own pottery kilns, they were extremely enthusiastic, working from dawn till dusk. At that time, in order to increase production, the workers discussed dividing the four wheels into four groups, with five workers in each wheel, and challenged each other. The goal was for each group to buy a big mule, and the products should be of good quality, large quantity, and low cost. Therefore, everyone usually worked diligently from dawn till dusk. The output of bowls from one wheel increased from 400 to 600. By the end of the year, a total of three kilns were fired, producing 60,000 bowls. When the accounts were settled at the end of the year, after deducting all expenses, the net profit was 51 shi and 5 dou of rice, and each worker could receive 450 jin of rice. In order to expand reproduction, the workers reinvested the dividends as shares. As a result, the share capital increased to 750,000 yuan, and a donkey and a mule were bought. At this time, in order to improve everyone's production efficiency, a profit-sharing method was democratically discussed and formulated based on the skill level. Due to democratic management, reasonable profit sharing, government support, and after resolving the group members' fear of being struggled against after development, the kiln gradually expanded, and the work became more active. The output of finished products per wheel increased to 700. The group members happily said: "We used to suffer for the landlords, but now we are doing it for ourselves, and the more we do, the more energetic we become." In 1947, with the united efforts of the workers, two wheels fired eleven kilns of goods, producing 200,000 bowls, and bought two more mules. By the end of the year, the share capital had increased to 8,500 yuan (new currency).
    This kiln is a kiln that combines agriculture and sideline occupations. During the spring plowing and busy farming season, the kiln is closed after everyone's discussion. During sowing or autumn plowing, it is stipulated that whoever plows the land with the kiln's livestock will contribute the corresponding things. In order to be reasonable and fair, it is democratically stipulated that plowing one mu of land is equivalent to 100 jin of grass, and if there is no grass, it is 8 jin of rice. In this way, the workers have no opinion on whether they plow more or less. Men and women reflect that they don't have to work hard during the autumn harvest, the land is well cultivated, and they also earn money. It is truly a pure profit and harmless, and everyone benefits from mutual assistance.
    In order to make the mutual aid even better, Shengwang also led everyone to discuss business policies. Based on the needs of the masses, it was decided to make more large bowls in the spring and more chamber pots and lidded jars in the autumn and winter. Therefore, the products of Si Sheng Kiln have a wide market. Now, the mutual aid group led by Guo Shengwang has 25 full and semi-auxiliary laborers, and the capital has increased to 110,000 yuan. The group members unanimously said: "Si Sheng Kiln is our treasure trove." Now the kiln is planning to produce two kilns of finished goods, and prepare all the raw materials for next year by the end of the year. A small-scale cooperative mill will also be opened in the winter to grind flour.

### 实行农副业互助　四盛磁窑成了“聚宝盆”

　　实行农副业互助
    四盛磁窑成了“聚宝盆”
    【太行讯】壶关清流村郭生旺领导的农副互助磁窑，由于政府扶持，领导管理民主，分红合理，得到了发展，受到组员拥护。该村战前是磁业发达的村子，日本占领时期全被摧残歇业。四五年八月解放后，在解放军某团扶持下复了业。后因部队转移，将碗窑让给工人独营，后又到政府贷款两万元，连同过去赚下的工资，共凑米七石七斗，将四盛磁窑买下，四六年二月正式开工。这时共有十八户投资，共四盘做碗轮子，工人二十一个，公推郭生旺为组长。由于工人们得到了政府的帮助，自己开了磁窑情绪极高，起早搭黑劳动。当时工人们为了增加生产，又讨论四盘轮子分成四组，每一盘轮子五个工人，并进行挑战，目标是每一组要买一条大骡子，出的货要质好量多，成本低。所以大家平素都是起早搭黑劳动经营。一盘轮出碗由以前四百个，增到六百个。到年底共烧三窑，出碗六万个。年底算帐时，除一切开支净赚红利米五十一石五斗，每个工人能分四百五十斤米。工人为了扩大再生产，又将红入股营业。因而股金增到七十五万元，同时买了毛驴骡子各一条。这时为了提高大家生产效率、按照把式好坏民主讨论订出分红办法。由于民主管理、分红合理、政府扶持、及解决了组员们怕发展大了挨斗争的思想后，该窑日渐扩大，工作更加积极；每盘轮子出成品又增至七百个。组员高兴的说：“以前给地主受哩，现在成了自己的越受越有劲。”四七年在工人团结一致努力下，两个轮共烧十一窑货，出碗廿万，又买骡子二头。到年底股金增至八千五百元（新币）。
    该窑是农副结合的窑，春耕农忙时通过大家商量窑上歇工。下种或秋耕又规定窑上牲口给谁犁地谁出东西。为作到合理公平，又民主规定犁一亩地是一百斤草，没草八斤资米，这样决定给工人们犁多犁少都没意见，男人妇女反映说秋耕不用费劲了，地也种好了，钱也赚上了，真是净利无害，互助人人沾光。
    生旺为了把互助搞的更好，又领导大家讨论了业务方针，根据群众需要，订出春天多做大碗，秋冬多做便壶、带盖罐钵，因此四盛窑出的货销路很广。现在郭生旺领导的互助组，共有全半辅劳力二十五个，资金已增至十一万元。组员一致说：“四盛窑是咱的聚宝盆”。现该窑正计划要出两窑成货，并在年底把明年原料全准备停当，冬季还要开一小型社磨面。
