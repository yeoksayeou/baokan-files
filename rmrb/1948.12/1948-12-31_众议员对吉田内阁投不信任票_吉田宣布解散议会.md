　　House of Representatives Passes Vote of No Confidence in Yoshida Cabinet
　　Yoshida Announces Dissolution of Parliament
　　【Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 28th】 Tokyo News: Amidst the nationwide clamor for the resignation of the reactionary Shigeru Yoshida cabinet, the Japanese House of Representatives passed a motion of no confidence in the Yoshida cabinet on the night of the 23rd with 227 votes against 130 votes. However, according to the Japanese Constitution prescribed by MacArthur, after the House of Representatives passes a motion of no confidence, the cabinet must either submit its resignation en masse or dissolve the parliament. The one-party cabinet of the Democratic Liberal Party has decided to take the latter approach. It formally announced the dissolution of the parliament on the same night and officially announced that the third post-war general election in Japan would be held on January 23rd of next year. After the dissolution of the parliament, Eisaku Sato, the secretary-general of the Yoshida cabinet, rushed to MacArthur's headquarters to report on the decision of the Yoshida cabinet to dissolve the parliament.
　　Since Shigeru Yoshida formed his cabinet on October 19th, the Japanese working class has taken a firm stance of opposition. The Japanese Communist Party's Akahata newspaper recently published in a prominent position the speech of Sanzo Nosaka (i.e., Susumu Okano), leader of the Japanese Communist Party, in the parliament, in which he accused Yoshida of selling out Japan to the United States, plotting to turn Japan into a colony of the United States. Because the reactionary betrayal, corruption, and decay of the Yoshida cabinet have aroused such strong opposition among the Japanese people, the other reactionary parties in the parliament also voted for the motion of no confidence in this vote in order to win votes.

　　众议员对吉田内阁投不信任票
  　吉田宣布解散议会
    【新华社陕北二十八日电】东京消息：在日本全国纷纷传来要求反动的吉田茂内阁辞职的声浪下，日本众院于二十三日夜以二二七票对一三○票通过对吉田内阁的不信任案。但依照麦克阿瑟钦定的日本宪法，在众院通过不信任案后，内阁或者提出总辞职，或者解散议会。民主自由党的一党内阁，已决定采取后一办法，它于同日夜正式宣布解散议会，并于二十四日正式公布于明年一月二十三日举行日本战后第三度的大选。在议会解散后，吉田内阁的书记长佐藤荣作即赶至麦克阿瑟总部，就吉田内阁解散议会的决定，提出报告。
    日本工人阶级自吉田茂于十月十九日组成内阁之日起，即采取坚决的反对态度。日共赤旗报最近曾以最显著地位刊载日共领袖野坂参三（即岗野进）在议会中的发言，其中指斥吉田正将日本出卖给美国，图使日本变为美国的殖民地。由于吉田内阁的反动卖国、贪污、腐化已在日本人民中引起如此强烈的反对情绪，致使议会中其他反动政党在这次表决中，亦为了争取选票，大部分投了不信任票。
