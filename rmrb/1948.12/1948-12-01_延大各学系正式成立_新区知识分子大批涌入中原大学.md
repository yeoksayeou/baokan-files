Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 28th: Yan'an University has formally established four departments: Political Science and Law, Economic Construction, Education, and Literature and Art. The Political Science and Law Department is divided into three classes: Administration, Justice, and Culture, with Wang Ziyi, Secretary-General of the Border Region Government and concurrently Director of the Civil Affairs Department, serving as the department head. The Economic Construction Department is divided into two classes: Agriculture and Industry, with Hui Zhongquan, Deputy Director of the Border Region Government's Construction Department, serving as the department head. The Education Department is divided into two classes: Secondary Education and National Education, with Liu Zeru serving as the department head. The Literature and Art Department is divided into classes such as Literature and Art, Drama, Fine Arts, Music, and Journalism, with Ke Zhongping, Director of the Border Region Writers Association, serving as the department head. The study period for each department is set at one to two years. Yan'an University was founded in 1941, formed by merging the Shaanbei Public School, Yan'an Chinese Women's University, Mao Zedong Youth Cadre School, Foreign Language School, Lu Xun Academy of Arts, Academy of Natural Sciences, and Administrative Academy. By last spring, it had graduated over 10,000 students. After the Hu Zongnan bandit troops invaded northern Shaanxi last year, the school's faculty and students participated in various wartime tasks. After the liberation of Yan'an this April, all teachers and students of the school immediately began to repair school buildings and classrooms on the ruins destroyed by the Hu bandits, and enthusiastically engaged in the study of Chinese revolutionary theory and policy. The school also established a branch school in Luochuan, attracting a large number of young students and educators from newly liberated areas and areas under Kuomintang rule to come and study and teach.

Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 28th: Intellectuals from the Central China New Area are flocking to Central China University in large numbers. According to Pan Zinian, Vice President of the university, as of the 16th of this month, the school already has more than 1,900 students. In addition, there are more than 100 students coming from the three regions of Neixiang, Yanling, and Luoyang, and more than 300 people have registered in Kaifeng. The school's research class has ended, and all students have been assigned work, some of whom have gone to North China to serve as middle school teachers. The school's first and second brigades are about to end, and 180 students will be assigned work or continue their studies.
