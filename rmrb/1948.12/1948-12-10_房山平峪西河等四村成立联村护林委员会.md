Fangshan Second District, Pingyu, Xihe, Qianhoushimen and other four villages are jointly establishing a forest protection committee. These four villages all have large forests. For example, Xihugang and Liuchun in Pingyu have more than 100 mu of sandalwood and prickly ash trees, producing no less than hundreds of thousands of catties of sandalwood and nearly a thousand catties of prickly ash every year. They also produce a large number of school shares, cover strips, and so on. Qiantuo Port in Xihe Village also has a large poplar forest. Some of these forests are now managed by the village, and some are still privately owned. In recent years, indiscriminate logging and livestock damage have been quite serious. This autumn, after the masses heard the government's call to ban mountains and protect forests, everyone supported it very much. Each village then elected five representatives to jointly establish a forest protection committee to jointly manage and be responsible for resolving forest protection matters, and formulated five covenants.

　　房山平峪西河等四村成立联村护林委员会
    北岳房山二区平峪、西河、前后石门四村将联合成立护林委员会。该四村均有较大山林，如平峪的西湖港、流村等处有百余亩檀木林和花椒树，每年出产檀木不下几十万斤，花椒近千斤。还出产大量的校股、盖条等等。西河村前坨港也造很大的杨树林。这些山林，现在有的归村公管，有的仍属私有。近年来滥肆砍伐与牲口糟蹋破坏现象相当严重。今秋群众听到政府号召禁山护林以后，大家极为拥护，每村遂推派代表五人，联合成立护林委员会，共同管理，负责解决护林事宜，并订出五条公约。
