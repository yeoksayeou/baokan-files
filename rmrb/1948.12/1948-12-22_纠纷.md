　　Dispute
　　Yue Feng

　　On the road to advance into Suiyuan, Chen Dagang and Hao Ji of the communication squad had a small dispute. Those who knew said it was for friendship and mutual assistance, those who didn't know just thought the two had a disagreement.

　　Hao Ji was only eighteen years old, a small, thin guy, half a head shorter than others. Usually during marches, although he could walk any distance, he always relied on others to carry his gun and equipment. Since the model worker award meeting a few days ago, and hearing that this operation was to raid Fu Zuoyi's hometown, he had been secretly trying to come up with a plan to earn merit.

　　Chen Dagang was big and burly, a strong man. During marches, he usually carried things for others. Especially often for Hao Ji. But this time, unfortunately, he developed a big abscess on his ankle, which made it difficult to walk normally, let alone march.

　　Clerk Lao Xing suggested to the instructor, "It would be best to get him a donkey to ride." But since the instructor advocated earning merit during marches, Chen Dagang thought, "Don't look at the problem with my leg, when it comes to fighting in Suiyuan, raiding Fu Zuoyi, I'm not one to cause trouble for comrades, I definitely won't ride that donkey—earn merit! You only see the mud on my legs when I'm in deep water." Thinking this, he excitedly found Clerk Lao Xing and asked him to write a plan to earn merit, the first point of which was: "Not afraid of hunger or cold, not afraid of big mountains or big rivers, walk a hundred li, then a hundred li; two hundred li, then two hundred li; guaranteed not to fall behind or lag behind."

　　Hao Ji lifted the curtain and came in, put a piece of paper on the table, and pointed to it with his finger, saying to Lao Xing, "Hey, write this down. First point: resolutely march to the end, not letting others help, and also helping others. A fighting cock doesn't fall behind a chicken." Chen Dagang clapped his hands and said, "Right! Add this point for me too: A fighting cock doesn't fall behind a chicken!" Lao Xing liked to draw, and after writing, he drew a flower on each person's paper. He said with a smile, "Let's see who is the fighting cock and who is the chicken." The two of them put the plans in their breast pockets, their eyes met, and they walked away laughing.

　　In the first two days of the march, they walked and arrived together every time, seventy or eighty li, without any hesitation. Everyone else was the same, chest out, head held high, walking heroically.

　　On the third day, the instructor announced, "The road is about a hundred li, and we have to cross a big mountain, please pay attention, comrades!..." People secretly added fuel. After walking thirty or forty li, Hao Ji thought, "Today the road is long, Dagang is strong, but the sore on his leg is worse than usual, I should help him." He went up and grabbed Dagang's gun to carry it, saying, "Hey, let me carry it for a while, be careful your sore gets worse." When Dagang heard this, his face flushed, and he yanked the gun back, snatched it back, and said, "What's this little sore? Don't you see I'm walking fine? Go carry it for someone else." Hao Ji stared blankly for a moment, and swallowed hard.

　　They began to climb the big mountain. People cheered up and climbed upwards, shouting "Oh, oh." Chen Dagang had the most energy and shouted the loudest. Carelessly, he stumbled on a stone, and although he didn't fall, he severely bumped his leg. A stream of pus and blood flowed from the sore, sticking redly to his ankle. When Hao Ji saw this, he felt very uncomfortable. He used to be helped by him, how could he watch him suffer now? If he exhausted him so that he couldn't walk tomorrow, it would be a loss. Thinking and thinking, he suddenly snatched the gun from Dagang's shoulder. When Dagang saw this, he was very anxious, and lunged forward, grabbed Hao Ji's gun from behind with both hands and snatched it back into his arms. When Hao Ji turned around, he had already run far away, and said with a smile, "Right! Taking turns carrying is fine too!"

　　Ten li away from the camp, Hao Ji looked at Dagang's limping leg, feeling both sorry and anxious. It was obvious that he couldn't walk, but he stubbornly refused to let anyone help him. Dagang, on the other hand, walked carefully. Seeing that Hao Ji wanted to snatch it again, he couldn't help but get anxious, thinking, "Everyone is the same, I'm tired and others are tired too, no matter what, I'll grit my teeth and get there." Suddenly, the backpack was grabbed by Hao Ji again. Xiao Hao said while panting, "You! Alas, we have to walk tomorrow! Give it to me!..." Dagang tightened the backpack straps tightly, shaking his arms hard. Hao Ji refused to let go, the two of them pulling and tugging, like a revolving lantern, turning several circles on the road. Finally, Dagang became anxious, deliberately put on a stern face, glared and shouted, "What are you doing? Who's playing with you again and again? Let go!" When Hao Ji saw that he had turned hostile, he was frightened and quickly let go, his face burning with embarrassment. He pouted and retreated to the squad, not saying a word for a long time. Dagang deliberately pretended to be angry, and limped to the camp. Some people saw that their expressions were not good, and wanted to go up and say a few words of persuasion, but the squad leader said, "Don't worry about them, there's no need for explanation work!"

　　On the big rest day, the company's "March Newsletter" published an article by Lao Xing: A piece of paper with two people drawn on it, a big guy with a sore on his leg; a small guy, looking weak, but both were sticking out their chests, holding their heads high, walking with big strides, and below were four lines of doggerel.

　　Dagang and Hao Ji, march really hard;
　　The two compare, both are fighting cocks.

　　After they read it, they couldn't help but "poof" and smiled at each other.

　　纠纷
    越风
    在进军绥远的道上，通信班的陈大广和郝济闹了一场小纠纷。知道的说是为了友爱互助，不知道的只当是俩人起了意见。
    郝济才十八岁，小瘦个子，比别人矮半脑袋。平常行军，他虽然多远也能走到，可是短不了靠别人背枪扛东西的。自从前几天开过奖励模范会，又听说这回行动是抄傅作义的老家，心眼里就蹩足了劲，暗自琢磨着个立功计划。
    陈大广生的五大三粗，是个壮汉。行起军来，照例是给别人扛东西的时候多。尤其常给郝济背。偏是这次不凑巧，腿腕子上长了个大脓疮，平常走道就不得劲，要行起军来，可真够他受的。
    文书老邢给指导员提议说：“最好给他要个毛驴骑上。”可是自从指导员一提倡行军中立功，陈大广就想：“别瞧腿上有毛病，要说打绥远，抄傅作义，咱可不是给同志添麻烦的人，决不能骑那毛驴——立功！出水才见两腿泥啦。”想着，兴冲冲地找见文书老邢，请他代笔写了个立功计划，头一条就说：“不怕挨饿受冻，不怕大山大水，走一百就一百；二百就二百；保险不掉队拉距离。”
    郝济把帘子一挑也进来了，把一张纸铺在桌子上，用手指着对老邢说：“嗳，给写一下。第一条：坚决行军到底，不让别人帮助，还要帮助别人。落公鸡不落草鸡。”陈大广两手一拍说：“对！也给我添上这一条：落公鸡不落草鸡！”老邢爱画，写完了，又给每人纸上描了一朵花。笑着说：“看看谁是公鸡谁是草鸡吧。”他俩把计划装在贴胸口袋里，四只眼一碰、各自笑着走开了。
    前两天行军，每次走七八十里，俩人一齐走一齐到，没一个含糊的。别人也一样，都挺着胸，仰着头，大步走得雄赳赳的。
    第三天，指导员宣布说：“道大约百十里，还要过一座大山，请同志们注意！……”人们都暗地加了油。走出了三四十里，郝济想：“今天道远，大广虽说壮实，腿上的疮不比平常，还是帮助一下他。”上去抱住大广的枪苗子说：“哎，我替你扛两步吧，小心你的疮犯大了。”大广一听，脸上先有三分热，把枪往回一拽，夺了回来说：“这点小疮算什么？不看我走的好好的，你给别人背去吧。”郝济直着眼楞了一下，使劲咽了一口吐沫。
    开始上大山了。人们都振起精神，噢、噢，叫着往上爬。陈大广精神最大，喊声最高，一不小心，被石头绊了个趔趄，虽说没栽倒，却狠狠地把腿墩了一下，一道脓血从疮口流出来，红红地贴在腿腕子上。郝济见了，心里怪难受。本来自己先前常让他帮助，这会怎能睁眼看人家受罪？真要把他累的明天不能走了，可是个损失。想着想着就猛不防从大广肩膀上把枪抢下来，大广一看好着急，往前一窜，从背后抓住郝济的枪双手一带，又抢到自己怀里。郝济回过身来的时候，他已跑开老远了，笑着说：“对！换着背背也行！”
    离宿营地还有十来里地了，郝济看着大广一拐一拐的腿，又是心疼，又是着急，明摆着走不动了，偏是硬不叫人帮助。大广呢，一边走，一边加小心。看着郝济又想上来夺，忍不住着急，心想：“人都是一样，我累别人也是累，不管怎么，一咬牙也就到啦。”忽然，背包又叫郝济抓住了。小郝一面喘气一面说：“你这个人！唉，明天还得走嘛！给我！……”大广把背包带子勒的紧紧的，使劲晃着膀子，郝济是死也不肯松手，俩人一拉一拽，走马灯一样，在道上转了好几个圈。最后，大广急了，故意把脸一唬，瞪起眼来喝道：“干什么你？谁跟你一次一次闹着玩？撒了！”郝济见翻了脸，吓的忙松开手，面上热辣辣地挺不好意思，撅起嘴退回班里，大半天没有言声。大广故意装着生气样儿，一蹩劲走到宿营地。有人见他俩眉眼都不大舒展，想上去劝说几句，班长说：“不用管他们，这用不着解释工作！”
    大休息那天，连里“行军快报”登出老邢一篇稿子来：一张纸上画着两个人，一个大个子，腿上长着疮；一个小个子，长的挺弱气，但都是挺着胸，昂着头，大步走的镗镗的，下边还写着四句快板。
    大广和郝济，行军真努力；
    二人比一比，都是大公鸡。
    他俩看了，忍不住“噗哧”一声，来了个对脸笑。
