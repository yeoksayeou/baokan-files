Xinhua News Agency, North China, 4th. According to news from newspapers in Beiping and Tianjin: The anti-hunger movement of public employees in the Kuomintang-controlled areas continues to develop in Shanghai, Chengdu, Wuhan, Beiping, Tianjin, and other places. Postal workers in Shanghai went on strike for three hours starting at 12:00 noon on the 20th of last month to protest the Kuomintang authorities' rejection of their demands for improved living conditions. The anti-hunger struggle of municipal public employees in Chengdu has persisted for more than half a month since the end of October. Teachers from twenty-nine municipal primary schools resolved to continue their general strike on the 17th of last month. Public employees in other municipal agencies have either gone on strike or engaged in work slowdowns to strive for the realization of their demands for improved living conditions. Students and workers at Wuhan University, Wuchang Physical Education College, and Central China University held a "Live-Saving Auction" on the 19th of last month, reluctantly selling their clothes and other items at low prices to exchange them for food, and continued their strike. Self-funded students at the Hubei Provincial Agricultural College and Medical College began a general strike for three days on the 15th of last month, demanding an increase in the number of publicly funded students or the implementation of full in-kind distribution. The Federation of Lecturers, Teaching Assistants, and Workers of the Sino-French University in Beiping, in order to fight for reasonable treatment, took "leave" for four days on the 11th of last month without result, and then resumed an indefinite period of "leave" on the 16th. All teaching assistants at Beiyang University in Tianjin, in order to fight for the minimum conditions for survival, resolved to stage another three-day strike starting on the 19th of last month, and issued a declaration, accusing the Kuomintang rule of the pain of hunger and cold.

Xinhua News Agency, North China, 30th. The anti-hunger movement of public employees in the Kuomintang-controlled areas continued to expand in Wuhan, Xiamen, and Shanghai in the middle of this month. According to disclosures in newspapers in Beiping and Tianjin: Teachers and students of Wuchang Physical Education College went on strike and formed a "Committee to Demand Survival" to carry out the anti-hunger struggle. Teachers and staff of provincial middle schools in Wuchang and Hanyang decided to take "general leave" for three days starting on the 17th because their request for rice allocation was not granted. Civil servants of the Kuomintang Hubei Provincial Government held an emergency meeting on the issue of living conditions and decided to take "general leave" for two days starting on the 15th. All teachers and students of Wuhan University in Wuchang have been persisting in their strike since the 9th, and were still striking on the 16th. Employees of nine newspapers in Xiamen went on a general strike on the 14th after their demands for improved treatment were rejected, and the newspapers were forced to suspend publication. Teachers and students of Tongji University in Shanghai took "general leave" starting on the 10th because they had been eating thin porridge for three consecutive days.
