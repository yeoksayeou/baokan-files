Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 7th. The total collapse of the Kuomintang's Xuzhou defense line has caused the Nanjing reactionaries' escape to suddenly reach a climax. More than four-fifths of the pseudo-Legislative Yuan's legislative members have already fled Nanjing. The families of the pseudo-Foreign Minister Wang Shijie and the pseudo-former Finance Minister Wang Yunwu have all fled to the United States. According to foreign news agency reports from the 3rd and 4th, starting from the 3rd, all transportation departing from Nanjing has been placed under military control by the Kuomintang to facilitate the Kuomintang officials' preemptive escape. "Anyone not belonging to an official's family or government agency cannot practically obtain a train seat." The Kuomintang government "is hurrying to pack the properties of various departments." The first group of personnel from the Kuomintang Air Force's Fifth Air Transport Headquarters fled to Taiwan on the 3rd, and the Navy Headquarters personnel are escaping in three batches by ship. Nearly a thousand family members of the Kuomintang "magazine" have begun to move to Guangzhou. Thousands of officials crowded Nanjing Railway Station "trying to get a chance to go to Hong Kong or Guangzhou." Shanghai shipping companies have been ordered to prepare fifty ships in Nanjing and Shanghai for the Kuomintang government "to use in emergencies." The U.S. Joint Military Advisory Group is also hurriedly evacuating its employees and families using airplanes and automobiles. Another U.S.-Chiang collaborationist invasion agency, the "China Rural Reconstruction Joint Committee," has decided to move its headquarters to Guangzhou. The Kuomintang officials' scramble to escape "has made the stations and docks a scene of chaos and fighting." The Railway Administration's freight yards "are piled high with luggage up to the ceiling."

Beiyue Telegram: Zhangjiakou, under the rule of Bandit Fu before his death, has already presented a scene of panic and chaos. Starting on the 10th of last month, the families of the bandit army began to retreat to Tianjin, and it was limited to be completely withdrawn by the beginning of this month. While preparing to escape for their lives, they also wanted to plunder the factories and machines of the people of Zhangjiakou, shamelessly propagating to the citizens that "the Northeast was defeated mainly because the families and factories were not moved away in advance" to cover up their preparations to escape. However, when the "madams" and "misses" hurriedly and chaotically sold their belongings at low prices, running to the train in groups, competing and fearing to be the last to escape, who with bright eyes could not see through it? It is Bandit Fu who is panicking; the people are not only not panicking but also know that their happy days are coming. The liberation of Zhangjiakou is imminent. Workers and citizens are actively fighting against Bandit Fu. Bandit Fu forced the workers to move the machines, but the workers not only ignored them but also said angrily: "Move? Moving them to Tianjin and Beiping, they are still ours; moving them to Shanghai and Nanjing cannot escape the hands of the People's Liberation Army." The workers know that the people's army is about to liberate them; some come out to report to us, and some send us letters saying: "Unless the plane bombs me to death, I will definitely watch over the machines." The police and pseudo-officials also know that Bandit Fu is about to be finished, and they have become clever. As for those who fled outside the city for fear of being drafted into the army, the police not only do not stop them but also send them off. An employee of the pseudo-Chahar Provincial Government said to his relatives: "You go home first (referring to the Liberated Area). Fu Zuoyi is going to escape to Jiangnan, and he will also arrest a large number of people. You go first, and I will leave later depending on the situation." The citizens resisted conscription; some ran to the Liberated Area, and some cleverly maneuvered in the city with the bandits, trying every means to avoid being drafted by Bandit Fu to be sent to their deaths. The youths are hiding, the shops are closed, and there are very few pedestrians on the streets except for the chaotic Bandit Fu preparing to escape. Some merchants said: "Wait! We will do our good business when the People's Liberation Army comes!"

    国民党徐州防线崩溃后
    南京匪帮逃跑达高潮
    张垣傅匪眷属逃往天津
    【新华社陕北七日电】国民党徐州防线的全部崩溃使得南京反动派的逃跑突然达于高潮。伪立法院立法委员五分之四以上已经逃离南京。伪外长王世杰及伪前财长王云五的家眷都已逃往美国。据三四两日外国通讯社消息：三日起由南京出发的一切交通工具已被国民党置于军事管制之下，以便于国民党官员的抢先逃亡，“任何不属于官吏家庭或政府机关的人，实际上都不可能得到一个火车位置”。国民党政府“各部的财物正在赶紧包捆中”。国民党空军第五空运总部首批人员已于三日逃往台湾，海军司令部人员正在分三批搭船逃跑。国民党“杂志社”近千名家属已开始迁往广州。千百名的官员挤在南京火车站上“试图得到前往香港或广州的机会”。上海各轮船公司已被命令在京沪预备五十艘船只，供国民党政府“于紧急时使用”。美国联合军事顾问团亦正使用飞机及汽车匆忙撤退其雇员及家属。美蒋合组之另一侵华机构“中国农村联合委员会”，已决定将其总部迁往广州，国民党官员的争先恐后逃亡“已使车站及码头呈一片混乱并发生撕打”。铁路管理局的货栈“行李已堆得和天花板一样高”。
    【北岳电】傅匪临死前统治下的张家口，已呈现一片恐慌混乱。上月十日开始，匪军家属即向天津撤退，并限于本月初完全撤完，他们在作逃命准备的时候，还想把张市人民的工厂机器也掠夺而去，无耻的向市民宣传说：“东北所以打败仗，主要就是因为事先没有把家属工厂等运走。”以掩饰其准备逃跑。但是当“太太”“小姐”们慌慌乱乱的把东西贱价变卖，成群结队争先恐后带着逃命的面孔跑上火车时，人们明亮的眼睛谁还看不透呢？慌乱的是傅匪，人民却不但不慌乱，而且知道自己幸福的日子就要到了。张垣的解放已经迫在眼前了，工人市民们正积极的和傅匪做斗争。傅匪强迫工人搬运机器，工人不但不理采，而且气愤地说：“搬？搬到天津北平也是我们的，搬到上海南京也逃不出解放军的手。”工人们知道人民的军队就要解放他们，有的出来找我们报到有的给我们捎信说：“除非飞机炸死，否则我一定看好机器。”警察伪职员们也知道傅匪就要完蛋，心眼也活了，因怕抓兵而逃出市外的人，警察们不但不阻止，而且还送他们。伪察省政府的一个职员对他的亲戚说：“你先回家吧（指解放区），傅作义要逃到江南去，而且还要大量抓人，你先走，我看情形随后就走。”市民们反抓丁，有的跑到解放区，有的灵活的在市内和匪徒周旋，想尽一切办法不让傅匪抓去送死。青年躲避了，商店关门了，街上除了混乱的准备逃跑的傅匪外，行人就很少了。有的商人说：“等着吧！解放军来了再作咱们的好买卖吧！”
