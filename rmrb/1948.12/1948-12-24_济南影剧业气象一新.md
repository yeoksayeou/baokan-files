Jinan's film and theater industry has shown an unprecedented new look. Of the original eight cinemas in Jinan, six have resumed business, and two are under repair and will soon reopen. All three major theaters have resumed business. A large number of Soviet films with educational significance for the people, such as "The Rainbow," "Collective Farm," "The Unbreakable Frontier," and "Son of the Regiment," have been screened successively. Old films, as long as their content does not oppose the people, such as "Pinocchio," are also allowed to be screened by the democratic government. After preliminary review of old dramas, all dramas that promote loss of national integrity, promote slavery, feudal superstition, and vulgar obscenity, such as "Si Lang Visits His Mother" and "The Cave of the Silken Web," are strictly prohibited. Better plays such as "Killing the Fish" and "Four Scholars" and already adapted scripts are encouraged to be performed more often. The business situation of Jinan's cinemas and theaters has now turned for the better. For example, the "First Theater" has just reopened, and its daily income has reached 700,000 to 900,000 North Sea currency. During the Victory Celebration Propaganda Week, "New Jinan" screened "The Rainbow," and the highest daily income reached 1.2 million. During the rule of the Kuomintang bandit gang, these cinemas and theaters suffered from heavy taxes and levies, and Kuomintang soldiers, police, military police, and secret agents watched movies without buying tickets and beat up employees, resulting in business depression. The actual income was generally only 40% to 50% of the total ticket price. Not only were the employees of the cinemas and theaters living in hardship, but their personal safety was also not guaranteed. Managers of various cinemas and theaters said: Since liberation, not only has business income been better, but safety has also been guaranteed, and there are no more random beatings and disturbances like in the Kuomintang rule era.

　　济南影剧业气象一新
    济南的电影戏剧业，已显出一种前所未有的新气象。济南原有的八家电影院，现已有六家复业，二家在修理中，不久也可复业；三家大剧院则已全部复业。大批对人民富有教育意义的苏联影片如“虹”、“集体农场”、“不可侵犯的边疆”、“团的儿子”等名片已先后放映。旧的影片，只要内容不反对人民者，如“木偶奇遇记”等，民主政府亦准予放映。旧剧经初步审查后，凡表演丧失民族气节、提倡奴隶制度、封建迷信及低级淫荡之剧目，如“四郎探母”、“盘丝洞”等一律禁演，较好的戏如“打渔杀家”“四进士”等及已经改编之剧本，则提倡多演。济南影、剧院的营业情况现在已转入佳境，如“第一剧场”甫告复业，每日收入即达北海币七十万到九十万。祝捷宣传周中，“新济南”放映“虹”，一日中最高的收入达一百二十万元。这些影、剧院在国民党匪帮统治时，由于苛捐杂税，以及国民党军队、警察、宪兵、特务等看戏不买票，殴打职工，以致营业萧条，实际收入一般只有全部票价的四五成。影、剧院职工不仅生活困苦，即其人格生命亦无保障。各影、剧院经理说：解放以后不仅营业收入较好，安全上也有了保障，再没有国民党统治时代的乱打乱闹的现象了。　　　　　　　　　（新华社）
