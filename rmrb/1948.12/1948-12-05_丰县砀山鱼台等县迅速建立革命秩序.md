[Ji Lu Yu Telegraph, 27th] Since the start of the Huaihai Campaign, the Kuomintang regular army and local militia in the border counties of Feng, Dang, Yu, Yu, and Pei in the Third Military Subdistrict, fearing annihilation by our large forces, fled from the cities in succession between the 6th and 9th of this month over four days. Before fleeing, the enemy dispersed and hid small groups of puppet bandits and large quantities of military supplies. Our democratic governments and county and district armed forces entered the cities successively to carry out all restoration work. In addition to issuing announcements to reassure the people and establishing urban street government organizations, they also used various forms to vigorously publicize our policy of protecting and developing urban industry and commerce, stabilizing social order. By around November 12, large and small businesses in each county had officially opened for business. After our Dangshan County government and large unit entered the county seat on the 8th, they promptly organized a city defense command and a disciplinary team, which, in addition to maintaining public security and checking military discipline, earnestly undertook the task of protecting railway traffic. Primary and secondary schools in each county have gradually resumed classes. At the request of the masses, the armed forces of each county and district, combined with a portion of the armed forces of the subdistrict, conducted searches and suppressions and mass denunciations of small groups of armed enemy bandits hiding in various cities. According to statistics from Feng, Dang, Yu, and Yu counties (Pei county has not yet reported), a total of one heavy machine gun, four light machine guns, more than two hundred rifles, more than 19,000 rounds of rifle ammunition, and some other military equipment were found. During the search and suppression in Yutai, there was also contact with small groups of the enemy, resulting in the capture of one puppet company commander, one platoon leader, and two soldiers, and the killing or wounding of four enemies.
