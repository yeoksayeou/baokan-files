The Harbin Student Union and the Communist Youth League also jointly held a gathering on the evening of the 22nd to discuss methods of commemorating "December 9th" and "December 1st". Starting from December 5th, they will hold student speech contests and hold photo exhibitions of domestic and foreign youth movements, and convene a commemorative meeting on the 9th. In the Central Plains Liberated Area, the Central Plains University students decided to establish a student union in late November, and issued a letter to all students in the Central Plains Liberated Area on the 24th of the same month, suggesting the establishment of the All-Central Plains Liberated Area Student Union Federation within this year. They hope that each county will establish a county student union federation in early December, and each province will establish a provincial student union federation in mid-December, so as to convene the founding conference of the All-Central Plains Student Union Federation in late December. The Student Union of China University proposed that students from various schools in the Central Plains hold a propaganda week in early December to commemorate "December 1st" and "December 9th."
