　　Communist Party Member He Bingde's Transportation Brigade
  　Well-Planned Production and Prosperity, Increased Grain and Livestock, Popular Support
    [Taiyue Electric] He Bingde's transportation brigade in Gushiliang Village, Shizihe, Jicheng County, has persisted since 1946, overcoming disasters and achieving prosperity. It has now become a well-known model transportation team in the Shizihe area. In 1946, the Shizihe area suffered from spring drought and autumn floods, resulting in poor harvests. The 277 people in Gushiliang Village were short of food and drink for four months each, causing widespread anxiety. Some people wanted to wait for the struggle to distribute the fruits of victory, or rely on government relief, while others held a "fatalistic" mentality. At this time, Communist Party member He Bingde took the lead in organizing seven or eight households with livestock, including He Bingcai and He Qigui, to engage in transportation. They made a round trip to Hengshui Town in Jiang County to transport coal and salt. After deducting the expenses for people and livestock, each donkey earned more than four dou of rice. This positive development mobilized all the households with livestock. All seventeen donkeys in the village participated in this transportation team. After several trips, they earned a lot of money. He Bingde then discussed with everyone about using six or seven shi of wheat to open a mill and an oil press, organizing everyone to grind flour and press oil. In this way, more than sixty households in the village were organized to engage in sideline production. By the time of spring plowing, they had earned a total of more than 170 shi of refined grain, which roughly alleviated the spring famine, and then they turned to agricultural production. From their own experiences, everyone recognized the correctness of He Bingde's leadership and were willing to follow him. Over the past two years, transportation has increased by fourteen mules and five donkeys. The team has grown from seventeen households to thirty-six households. Hou Qizhong took out a loan last winter to buy a donkey. After working all winter, he exchanged it for a mule this spring. According to calculations in August, after repaying the loan and covering household expenses, he earned a mule and a set of furniture worth more than 700,000 yuan. From April to July this year, the entire brigade earned more than 130 shi of wheat and more than 4.9 million yuan in cash (enough to buy more than 160 shi of millet). Now He Bingde's transportation brigade has become prosperous. The success of this transportation brigade is inseparable from He Bingde's active leadership. First, he is diligent in accounting, calculating each transportation trip so that there is no need to keep accounts, and reducing disputes during profit sharing. In particular, this stimulates everyone's production enthusiasm. Seeing money each time boosts their morale, thus expanding rapidly. Second, he has a plan and can grasp the situation, doing whatever makes money. If there are feet to use, he hires them; if not, he invests his own money to do business. For example, this summer, Jiang County had a large demand for jars at high prices, so he transported jars to Hengshui, Jiang County, and earned a lot of money. When plowing wheat fields, he also sent fifteen livestock to Jiang County to sell their labor. Plowing for one day earned two dou of wheat, and in half a month they earned 45 shi, without delaying their own wheat planting. In addition, He Bingde can often inquire about prices in all directions and solicit goods. Every trip always earns money. Third, they help each other and solve difficulties. For example, Hou Qizhong wanted to buy livestock, but he did not have enough capital. After discussion, everyone lent him 300 jin of salt and 40,000 yuan to buy a donkey. After running all winter, he wanted to exchange it for a mule, and the transportation team lent him more than 200,000 yuan to buy a mule. Fourth, the leadership is democratic, and everyone is consulted on matters. At the same time, he is actively responsible, hardworking, and enduring. For example, when transporting goods outside, there is originally a special person responsible for feeding the livestock, but He Bingde always has to check before he can sleep peacefully. Because of his good leadership, the county awarded him three shi and five dou of wheat. He received five dou himself, and the rest was distributed to everyone. He said, "Without everyone's active efforts, there would be no model brigade leader like me."

　　共产党员何丙德运输大队
  　生产发家计划周到粮畜增加群众拥护
    【太岳电】冀城十字河古十良村何丙德的运输大队，自民国三十五年坚持到现在，克服了灾荒，达到了发家致富。现已成为十字河一带众所周知的模范运输队。民国卅五年，十字河一带春旱秋涝，收成不好，古十良村二百七十七口人，每人就短四个月的吃喝，大家都很着慌。另外有些人想等待斗争分果实，或依靠政府救济，更有的抱着“听天由命”的思想。这时共产党员何丙德，首先结合了何丙才、何其贵等七、八家有牲口户，组织起来搞运输。到绛县横水镇往返驮了一趟炭盐，除人和牲口的开支外，一个毛驴就赚四斗多米。这样好的事情，把有牲口户都动员起来了，全村十七个小驴都参加了这个运输队。连着走了几回，赚了不少钱。何丙德又和大家商量用六、七石麦子开了一个磨坊，一个油坊，组织大家磨面、打油。这样把全村六十多户都组织了起来，进行副业生产。至春耕时，共赚了细粮一百七十多石，大体上克服了春荒，就转入农业生产。大家从亲身的体验中，认识了何丙德领导的正确，所以都愿跟上走。二年来，靠运输增加了十四头骡子，五头毛驴。全队由十七户发展到三十六户。侯其中去冬贷款买了一头毛驴，走了一冬天，今春就换成骡子。八月的计算，除还完贷款和家里的吃穿零用等花费外，净赚下一头骡子，和一套家具，价值七十多万元。全大队从今年四月到七月，就赚了一百三十多石麦子，四百九十多万现款（能买一百六十多石小米）。现在何丙德的运输大队，已富裕起来了。这个运输大队所以能搞的好，这与何丙德积极领导分不开的。第一、能勤算帐，运输一次就算一次，这样既省得记帐，又可减少分红时纠缠不清的麻烦。特别是能刺激大家的生产情绪，回回见钱，回回劲头高，因此很快扩大了。第二、有计划，并能掌握情况，作到啥赚钱就作啥，有脚就揽脚，没脚就自己下本钱作买卖。比方今夏绛县的缸销路大，价格高，就贩缸到绛县横水，赚了很多钱。犁麦地时，又抽出十五个牲口去绛县卖晌，犁一天净赚二斗麦，半个月赚了四十五石，又没耽误自己的种麦。另外何丙德还能常常察访四方物价，兜揽货物，每走一次，总是赚一回钱。第三、互相帮助，解决困难。如侯其中想买牲口，但本钱不够，大家商量了借给他三百斤盐，四万块钱，就买了一头毛驴；跑了一冬天，想换成骡子，运输队又给他借了二十来万元，买成骡子。第四、领导民主，有事就和大家商量，同时又积极负责，吃苦耐劳。如在外运输时，喂牲口本来有专人负责，但何丙德每天总要去看看才放心睡觉。因为他领导的好，县上就奖给他三石五斗麦子，除自己得了五斗，其余都分给了大家。他说：“没有大家积极努力，那会有我这个模范大队长。”
