　　Thoughts and Suggestions After Reading "The Sun Shines Over the River"
　　Han Beisheng
　　"The Sun Shines Over the River" is an excellent novel. Because the work has great practical educational significance, its appeal is also extremely strong. This work is quite mature both politically and artistically. It depicts a very vivid picture of the peasant emancipation movement in the liberated areas in the past three or four years, thereby reflecting how the Party's policies deviated in the movement and how they were corrected. If the peasants understand this story, they will feel from the bottom of their hearts that the Communist Party's policies are not changing today and tomorrow. The past mistakes were due to the unclear policy thinking and lack of experience of the cadres, and some bad elements took advantage of loopholes in the movement, resulting in great deviations, and even some middle and poor peasants were struggled against. Although this issue has been corrected in rural areas, due to the lack of vivid education, the peasants generally believe that the past was wrong and today is right. Therefore, they cannot draw a definitive conclusion in their minds about whether the Party's policies will change again soon. Even some cadres believe that it was the change in the Party's policies that led to the correction, and they cannot realize that today's correction is precisely the adherence to the policies. The novel explains this point very clearly. As long as every peasant carefully recalls the process of the movement, they will be able to find out who are Yuan Hai, Xiao Chang, Xiao Dan, and Xiao Bao in their own village, so that they will quickly turn the principles in the novel into reality. I think this story will be more educational for the peasants than ten or a hundred times of publicity and mobilization, and it will also be of great benefit to their future production enthusiasm.
　　The novel mentions many issues: Branch Secretary Yuan Hai cannot adhere to principles and becomes the tail of the masses, bad cadre Xiao Chang degenerates and oppresses the masses, speculator Xiao Dan drills loopholes everywhere, the wavering and fear of the middle peasants' accumulation of wealth, the masses' support for rectifying the Party, feeling that there is a real place to reason. None of these should be regarded as mere historical narratives, but rather have a positive educational role for today's Party rectification in rural areas.
　　The novel is filled with the simple and pure feelings of the peasants. Xiao Bao, Ruan Ying, An Fa, Lao Guai, and Second Aunt are all vivid typical characters in the countryside. Their simple and pure spirit in dealing with problems is worth learning from. Due to the vividness of the story and the richness and conciseness of the language, it is vivid and colorful to read, as if you are participating in their various activities in person. There are too many advantages of the work, let everyone experience it in reading.
　　Finally, the issue of Xiao Bao's Party membership is not clearly stated. Although there have been comments among the masses, if the leader of the work team mentions it again from the side in the concluding remarks, it will add a lot of pleasure to the readers.
　　Although this is an excellent work, the writing is very popular, and the length is very compact, it is still not easy for the vast number of illiterate people and general district and village cadres to accept. It is also easy for comrades who have reading ability but do not like literature and art to let it go, which will be a regret, or it can be said to be a loss in work.
　　In order to make up for this loss, I suggest that this novel be adapted into a script, drum lyrics, or a comic strip booklet, so that the vast number of people in the liberated areas and cadres with lower cultural levels can universally enjoy this outstanding work, thereby achieving the purpose of education and propaganda.

　　读“邪不压正”后的感想与建议
    韩北生
    “邪不压正”是一篇极好的小说，由于作品的现实教育意义很大，所以它的感染力也极强。这篇作品不论从政治上艺术上都是相当成熟的，它把解放区近三四年来的农民翻身运动绘出了一幅极生动的图画，从而体现了党的政策在运动中怎样发生了偏差，又怎样得到了纠正。假若使农民懂得了这个故事以后，会使他们从内心感到共产党的政策并不是今天改了，明天变了，过去的错误是由于干部的政策思想不明确与经验缺乏，在运动中被一些坏分子钻了空子，以致造成很大偏差，连中贫农也被斗了一些。这个问题在农村中虽已进行了纠偏，但因缺乏生动的教育，在农民思想中只是一笼统的认为过去做错了，今天改对了。因之对党的政策是否不久还会改变？在他们的思想中得不出肯定的结论，甚至在某些干部思想中也认为是党的政策改变了才进行纠偏，并不能认识到今天正是坚持了政策而进行纠偏的。小说在这一点上交代的非常清楚。每一个农民只要把运动的过程仔细回想一下，便能在自己村中找出谁是元孩、小昌、小旦、小宝，这样便会把小说中的道理很快变为实际。我想这个故事对农民的教育比十次百次宣传动员要大得多，对今后生产情绪亦将有很大裨益。
    小说中所提到的问题很多：支部书记元孩不能坚持原则，作了群众的尾巴，坏干部小昌蜕化忘本欺压群众，投机分子小旦到处钻空子，中农聚财的摇摆与恐惧，群众对整党的拥护，感到真正有了说理的地方，这一些绝不能仅当作历史的叙述，而是对于今天农村的整党有积极的教育作用。
    小说中充溢着农民朴实而纯洁的感情，小宝、软英、安发、老拐、二姨等都是农村中活生生的典型人物，他们对待问题的朴实而纯洁的精神是值得我们学习的。由于故事的生动，语言的丰富与洗练，读起来有声有色，好象身临其境的也参加了他们的各种活动。作品的优点是太多了，只有在阅读中各人去体味吧。
    最后关于小宝的党籍问题没有点明，虽然在群众中已有了评论，如果在工作团组长的结语中从侧面再提一下，对于读者来说更会增加不少愉快。
    这虽是一篇绝好的作品，文字也非常通俗，篇幅也非常紧凑，但是对于不识字的广大群众及一般区村干部来说，仍是不易接受的。对于有阅读能力，但因不爱好文艺的同志也容易放过去，这将是一个遗憾，或者也可以说是工作上的损失。
    为了弥补这个损失，我建议将这篇小说能改编成剧本、大鼓词或连环图画小册子，使解放区广大群众及文化较低的干部普遍能享受这篇出色的作品，从而达到教育与宣传的目的。
