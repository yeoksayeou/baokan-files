The People's Liberation Army units on the Huaihai Front have very active company cultural activities during the battle to encircle and annihilate the Huang Wei Corps. The "Fireline News" of a certain regiment's soldiers' newspaper of the Nenjiang troops is printed and distributed to companies every day, containing pictures, clapper rhymes, short propaganda texts, and news. When the enemy used incendiary bombs, the Fireline News immediately wrote a clapper rhyme "Dealing with Incendiary Bombs," and distributed it with pictures. The clapper rhyme said: "Incendiary bombs, can burn people, mostly used in the charge. If your body catches fire, quickly roll on the spot, if it's just starting to burn, press it with soil. As long as you are flexible and mobile, the incendiary bomb will not work." To carry out education before attacking the enemy's forward positions, this type of leaflet immediately appeared: "Attacking the forward position is the key. Once the forward position is opened, the depth is easy to handle. Assault team, be brave, take ladders and jumping ladders with you. Concentrate firepower on one point, engineers blast closely, after blasting the roadblocks and trenches, quickly step forward with jumping ladders and ladders. Grenade team, throw grenades quickly, cover the setting up of ladders and the climbing of ladders. Assault team, like monkeys, climb over the wall regardless. When you reach halfway up the wall, first throw grenades inside the wall, even if there are enemies, they will be blown up. Once the forward position is broken, quickly develop to both sides. Keep the breakthrough, the title of hero belongs to us." In addition to publishing the Fireline News, the soldiers' newspaper also publishes mimeographed picture newspapers. When the regiment commends discipline models, these model figures appear in the picture newspaper. When the regimental party committee issues a call, each item is expressed in pictures in the picture newspaper. The Zhujiang troops publish an excellent "Company Culture" newspaper, with words, pictures, and current events. As soon as the first phase of the Huaihai Campaign ended victoriously, the situation map of the first phase appeared in "Company Culture." Each great victory of the autumn offensive and the heroic stories of this unit were painted into pictures and quickly sent to the companies. When the Huaihai troops' "People's Hero" newspaper's radio station began to encircle and annihilate the Huang Wei Corps, it broadcasted with the title "Prisoner of War Reception Center Quickly Prepare": "All levels of prisoner of war reception centers and liberation teams, please pay attention: please make full preparations quickly, because your work will be busy soon. … Quickly prepare houses to accommodate prisoners, arrange for prisoners to eat, sleep, and guard…" The news that the film team was coming to the front was also quickly broadcast: "Everyone, pay attention! The second team of the Northeast Film Team has brought photographic equipment to the front to film various news of the Huaihai Campaign. All the heroic scenes in our army's battles have the opportunity to be included in the lens and screened in front of the people of the whole country." The commanders and fighters of the Wujiang troops are famous builders of trench life, and they arrange trench life very well, called "Soldiers' Home." This time, the second company of a certain regiment of the Wujiang troops also set up a radio station in the trenches to broadcast the victory news. When the 110th Division of the enemy's 85th Army revolted and joined the Liberation Army, the news immediately spread from the radio station.

　　淮海前线我军连队文化活跃
    人民解放军各部在淮海前线围歼黄维兵团的战斗中，连队文化活动非常活跃。嫩江部队某团的战士报社，每天都印发刊载图画、快板及短小的鼓动文字和新闻的“火线报”分发连队。敌人使用了燃烧弹，火线报马上就写了“对付燃烧弹”的快板，配上图画印发出去。快板说：“燃烧弹，能烧人、多半用在冲锋中。身上如果着了火，赶快就地来打滚，要是刚刚燃着了，把土按住也能行。只要灵活又机动，燃烧弹也不中用。”要进行打敌军阵地前沿的教育，这类传单马上又出来了：“打前沿，是关键。前沿被打开，纵深就好办。突击队，要勇敢，梯子、跳梯带身边。火力集中在一点，工兵爆破紧接连，鹿砦壕沟爆破后，跳梯、梯子快上前。投弹组，快投弹，掩护搭梯、架梯子。突击队，猴子般，不顾一切墙上翻。上到半墙时，先往墙里投炸弹，就是有敌也要被炸烂。前沿被炸破，快向两侧来发展。保住突破口，头名英雄属于咱。”战士报社除出版火线报外，又出版油印画报。当团里表扬纪律模范的时候，这些模范人物，就在画报上出现了。团党委发出号召，画报上便逐条用图画表现出来。珠江部队出版一个出色的“连队文化”报，有字有画有时事。淮海战役第一阶段刚胜利结束，第一阶段的形势图就出现在“连队文化”上了。秋季攻势每次大捷和本部队的英雄故事都被用图画画出来，很快地送到连队去。淮海部队的“人民英雄”报的广播台，于部队开始围歼黄维兵团时，就用“俘虏收容所快作好准备工作”的题目广播说：“各级俘虏收容所、解放大队注意：请你们赶快进行充分的准备工作。因为你们的工作马上会忙起来了。……迅速准备收容俘虏的房子，布置俘虏吃饭、睡觉、以及警戒等工作……。”电影队到前方的消息，也很快被广播出来了：“大家注意！东北电影队第二队已带了摄影器材到了前方，要将这次淮海战役的各种新闻摄成影片。凡是我军战斗中的英勇场面，都有机会收入镜头，在全国人民面前放映。”乌江部队的指战员们，是有名的战壕生活建设者，他们把战壕生活安排得很好，叫做“战士之家”。这次，乌江某团二连，又在战壕里架起了广播台，广播胜利消息。当敌八十五军一一○师起义加入解放军时，消息马上从广播台传开了。
