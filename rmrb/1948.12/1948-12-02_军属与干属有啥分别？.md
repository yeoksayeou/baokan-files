From the Civil Affairs Department of the North China Government:

　　What is the difference between a military family member and a cadre family member? Answer to Comrade Li Guoen of the Fourth Sub-Courts of Peace:
    The distinction between military family members and cadre family members is not based on whether the comrade works in the front or the rear, but on which system the comrade works under. If your Fourth Sub-Court of Peace is under the leadership of the military system, your family will be treated as military family members. If it is under the leadership of the government system, your family will be treated as cadre family members. You can request a resolution from the district and village government by presenting a certificate from your organization.

　　军属与干属有啥分别？答和平四分院李国恩同志：
    军属与干属的分别，不按该同志在前方或后方工作，而按该同志在何系统工作而定，你所在的和平四分院，如属军事系统领导，你的家属即按军属待遇，如属政府系统领导，你的家属即按干属待遇，你可以拿着机关的证明文件，向区村政府请求解决。
