　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, December 29th: The Free Greece Radio broadcast that General Bardgotos, Political Commissar of the General Headquarters Direct Unit of the Democratic Army, recently gave a speech stating: The Democratic Army has undoubtedly increased in both quantity and quality, and its supplies and equipment have also been significantly improved. This spring, the Democratic Army first launched an offensive in Epirus (western Greece). The operations in Roumelia (opposite the Peloponnese peninsula in southern Greece) demonstrated the Democratic Army's ability to employ brilliant tactics and attack the enemy unexpectedly. The battles north of the Pindus Mountains (central Greece) demonstrated the invincible strength of the Democratic Army. The tactics adopted by the Democratic Army in August this year and its victory in the Vitsi area (northern Greece) are a continuation of the Democratic Army's consistent victories. The Democratic Army, which has increased in number, is intensifying operations in the Peloponnese peninsula, Roumelia, Thessaly (eastern Greece), Epirus, central Macedonia (northern Greece), and Evros. The characteristic of the Democratic Army's operations in large cities is the large-scale activities of demolition units and independent combat units. The source of the Democratic Army's strength lies in its moral and political superiority over the enemy. The policies of the Provisional Democratic Government are of great help in this regard. On the other hand, the royalist fascist soldiers are increasingly aware that they are being sent to serve as cannon fodder for the benefit of foreign capitalists.

　　希民主军力量增强
  　正在全国各地加紧进攻
    【新华社陕北二十九日电】自由希腊电台广播：民主军总部直属队政治委员巴德哥托斯将军顷发表谈话称：民主军在数量和质量上已经无可怀疑地有了增进，它的供应和军备也有了相当大的改善。今年春天民主军首先在艾匹鲁斯（希腊西部）发动攻势。在鲁麦利亚（希腊南部摩里亚半岛对岸）的作战，说明了民主军采用英明战法的能力及出其不意地攻击敌人的能力。平都斯山（希腊中部）北部的战斗，说明民主军的不可征服的力量。民主军于今年八月所采用的战术及其在维齐地区（希腊北部）的得胜，是民主军一贯胜利的继续。数量业已增加的民主军，正在摩里亚半岛、鲁麦利亚、色萨利（希腊东部）、艾匹鲁斯、马其顿（希腊北部）中部与艾夫罗斯加紧作战。民主军在大城市作战的特点，是爆破部队和独立作战部队的大举活动。民主军力量的来源，在于它在道义和政治上比敌人优越。临时民主政府的政策，对这一点有很大的帮助。另一方面，保皇法西斯军士兵正日益清楚地懂得，他们是为了外国资本家的利益而被送去当炮灰的。
