　　Notice for Sending Letters
    Recently, it has been discovered that the recipient's and sender's addresses on many letters are not detailed enough. Because there are many villages with the same name in each county, and some villages are even divided into "large, small, front, back, east, and west," it is difficult to find them if the county, district, direction, distance from the city, and village location are not clearly stated. Some letters are delayed for a long time, resulting in non-delivery. Because the sender's address is unclear, they cannot be returned. In addition, comrades in government agencies and military units often write the county, district, and village names where they currently reside when writing letters home, and their families write return letters according to the sending address. By the time the letter arrives, the unit has already moved, and the letter cannot be delivered, so it has to be returned. The comrades in government agencies and military units cannot receive letters from home and blame the post office for being irresponsible.
    In order to avoid these phenomena and ensure that every letter can be delivered to the recipient quickly and accurately, we hereby put forward several points for attention when sending letters, hoping that all sectors will pay attention to them:
    1. For comrades in government agencies and military units without a fixed address, unless they know for sure that their unit will be stationed in a certain place for a long time, the sending address can be written as the county, district, village name, and the unit number. In general, do not write the county, district, and village name, just write the unit number.
    2. The recipient's address should clearly state the border region, county, district, and village name. If it is an obscure small village or a village with many identical names, it is best to indicate which direction from the city, the number of miles, or a certain market town and which side of a famous large village, so that the mailman can easily deliver it.
    3. If there is a newly established county, the envelope should be written according to the new county. If you do not know about the new county division, write how far it is from the city to avoid delays.
    4. The handwriting should be clear, do not write cursive, abbreviated, or strange characters, so as not to be unrecognizable and cause errors.

### 寄信须知

　　寄信须知
    近来发现很多信件上收信和寄信地址写的不详细，因为各县有好多重名的村子，有的一个村子还分“大小前后东西”等村，如不写明县区方向距城里数，村的位置，很难寻找，有的往返耽误很多时间，结果无法投递，因寄信地址不详，又无法退回。还有机关部队的同志，往家写信、寄信地址常写当时所住的县区村名，家里便按照发信地址写回信，等信送到，部队早已转移了，信件无处投递，只得退回去，机关部队的同志得不到家信还要说邮局不负责。
    为了避免这些现象的发生，使每一封信都能迅速准确的送到收件人手里，特提出几条寄信须知，望各界注意：
    一、无固定住址的机关部队同志，寄信特除切实知道本部长期住到某地，发信地址可写县区村名及机关部队番号外，一般不要写县区村名，只写机关部队之番号即可。
    二、收信地址要写清某边区，县区村名，若是不出名的小村，或重名多的村子，最好写明在城那一方向、里数或某一集市及出名的大村的那一边，以使送信者便于投递。
    三、如有新设县份要按新县写封皮，如不知道划新县，即写离城多远以免迟慢。
    四、字体要清楚，不要写草字、简字、怪字，以免认不清送错误事。
