　　Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains, 4th: The Zhongzhou Farmers Bank in the Central Plains Liberated Area, since comprehensively issuing the Zhongzhou currency in October and resolutely implementing the elimination of counterfeit currency, has achieved a decisive victory with the enthusiastic support of people from all walks of life. As of the end of September, according to incomplete statistics from the Henan-Anhui-Jiangsu, Henan-West, Tongbai, and Jianghan Military Regions, counterfeit currency has been eliminated in 62 counties with a population of approximately 13.2 million, and the Zhongzhou currency is in the process of squeezing out counterfeit currency in 46 counties with a population of approximately 7 million. 1 million to 1.2 million billion in counterfeit currency has been eliminated, safeguarding the vital interests of the people in the Central Plains Liberated Area. In the process of eliminating counterfeit currency, the people of the Central Plains Liberated Area have fully cooperated with the democratic government. After the Henan-Anhui-Jiangsu and Henan-West Administrative Offices issued proclamations in July limiting the use of counterfeit currency, merchants and residents in towns such as Luoyang, Lushan, Ye County, and Yiyang voluntarily refused to use counterfeit currency in advance by the end of July and early August. The Luoyang Municipal Administration for Industry and Commerce registered 9.2349 billion yuan of counterfeit currency in a single day on August 9th. The economic organs of Lushan formed an urban work committee, convening mass meetings according to industry to publicize and organize citizens to eliminate counterfeit currency and consolidate the Zhongzhou currency. In order to completely eliminate counterfeit currency and to make Zhongzhou currency universally circulated to remote rural areas, the Henan-Anhui-Jiangsu region collected a portion of Zhongzhou currency as payment during the summer tax collection and extensively publicized the benefits of eliminating counterfeit currency in rural areas. In late September, the Shangcai Administration for Industry and Commerce went to Gao Yueji to publicize the elimination of counterfeit currency, collecting two to three billion yuan of counterfeit currency on the spot. Due to the rapid elimination of counterfeit currency and the influence of the great victory of the People's Liberation Army's autumn offensive, the credit of the Zhongzhou currency is extremely solid, prices are stable in various places, and industry and commerce have gradually recovered and prospered.

　　我中州币信用极巩固
  　中原排除伪币获重大胜利
    【新华社中原四日电】中原解放区中州农民银行，自十月份开始全面发行中州币，坚决贯彻排除伪币以来，在各阶层人民热烈支持下，业已取得决定性的胜利。截至九月底止，根据豫皖苏、豫西、桐柏、江汉四个军区不完全统计，已有六十二个县约一千三百二十万人口的地区已肃清了伪币，有四十六个县约七百万人口的地区中州票正在排挤伪币的过程中。排除了一百万至一百二十万亿伪币，保障了中原解放区人民的切身利益。在排除伪币过程中，中原解放区各地人民曾与民主政府充分合作。豫皖苏与豫西两行署于七月份颁发限期禁用伪币的布告后，洛阳、鲁山、叶县、伊阳等城镇的商民，均自动于七月底八月初先后提前拒用伪币。洛阳市工商管理局于八月九日一天之内，即登记了伪币九十二亿三千四百九十万元。鲁山各经济机关组成城市工作委员会，按照行业分别召开群众大会，宣传及组织市民排除伪币，巩固中州币。豫皖苏区为彻底排除伪币与使中州票普遍流通至偏僻农村，曾于夏征中折收一部分中州票作为代金，并深入农村广泛宣传排除伪币的利益。九月下旬上蔡工商局到高岳集上宣传排除伪币，当场就收集了二三十亿元伪币。由于伪币的迅速排除，以及人民解放军秋季攻势的伟大胜利影响下，中州币的信用极为巩固，各地物价平稳，工商业已逐渐恢复和繁荣。
