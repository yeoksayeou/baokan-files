    Persuading to Good, Admonishing Against Wrongdoing, Daily Self-Reflection, and Criticism & Self-Criticism
    By Ding Kun
    The old Chinese practices of persuading to good, admonishing against wrongdoing, and daily self-reflection appear superficially similar to our current emphasis on criticism and self-criticism, but in reality, there are significant differences.
    This difference is fundamental.
    The old practices of persuading to good, admonishing against wrongdoing, and daily self-reflection primarily stemmed from personal or private relationships, thus they were individualistic. Persuading to good and admonishing against wrongdoing were aimed at improving the individual being persuaded or admonished. This improvement was solely for that person, purely based on personal feelings, and did not emphasize the importance of persuading or admonishing to improve a collective endeavor. Therefore, the old practices were limited to close friends. If one wasn't a close friend, even if one clearly saw that their behavior would ruin things, one wouldn't dare to presumptuously say anything. Speaking frankly to someone with whom one has a superficial relationship would make both parties uncomfortable. As for the person being persuaded or admonished, unless they were extremely confused, they would naturally be pleased to hear this advice. On one hand, they could personally correct themselves and improve themselves. On the other hand, they felt that the person giving the advice treated them as a close friend and respected them. Therefore, "Yu bowed upon hearing good advice," and "Zilu rejoiced upon hearing his faults." This bowing and this rejoicing contained both aspects of happiness. Moreover, daily self-reflection was a matter of personal cultivation, unrelated to collective endeavors. Zengzi's daily self-reflection was: "Have I been disloyal in planning for others? Have I been untrustworthy in dealing with friends? Do I not practice what I am taught?" All of this was for his own sake, not reflecting on whether he had played a good or bad role in the collective cause that day. In short, whether towards oneself or others, everything stemmed from personal or private relationships.
    Because this attitude towards oneself and others was all for personal gain, the old practices of persuading to good, admonishing against wrongdoing, and daily self-reflection were not integrated but rather were two completely separate things.
    As for our current criticism and self-criticism, they stem from responsibility towards the collective cause. One should criticize close friends who have done wrong, and even "nodding acquaintance" friends should be criticized if they are found to have done something wrong. This criticism is not only for their sake, hoping they will improve, but more importantly, because their wrongdoing will affect the interests of the revolution. It is for the sake of the revolutionary interests that criticism is carried out. On the part of the person being criticized, they should naturally also be happy. This happiness is because, having received this criticism, they can make fewer mistakes against the revolution, and not just for their own sake. They should also be happy that the critic is responsible to the revolution and must not regard the critic as simply acting out of personal grudges, or calculating whether the other party is protecting or attacking them. The same goes for self-criticism. The method of daily self-reflection can also be used, but this reflection should also be on whether one has played a good or bad role in the interests of the revolution that day, and not just reflect on some personal matters unrelated to the interests of the revolution, starting from oneself.
    Because the attitude towards oneself and others is all for the revolutionary cause, criticism and self-criticism are integrated and must not be separated during implementation.
    This is the difference between persuading to good, admonishing against wrongdoing, daily self-reflection, and criticism and self-criticism. This difference arises from two different societies. If one takes things out of context and uses them casually, that is fine. But if one confuses them, misunderstandings will occur, which is extremely inappropriate.

    劝善规过三省吾身与批评自我批评
    丁昆
    中国旧日的劝善规过，三省吾身，和我们今天提出的批评、自我批评，从表面看来，似乎没有什么不同，但实际上却是有着很大差别的。
    这差别是在本质上。
    旧日的劝善规过，三省吾身，主要的是从个人或私人关系出发，因此是个人主义的。劝善规过为的是希望被劝被规的人好起来，这好也只是为了那个人，完全是私人感情的，并不是着重在为了要把一件大众的事业搞好，才去劝，才去规。所以旧日的劝善规过只限于知己朋友之间，倘不是知己好友，纵使明明见到他的行为会把事搞糟，也不肯去冒昧地说他。交浅而言深，是会使两方面都不愉快的。至于在被劝被规的人呢，倘不是十分糊涂，听到这规劝，自然也是高兴的。一方面他个人可以改正自己，使自己好起来，另一方面他觉得规劝的人是把自己当知己朋友待，也是尊重自己的。所以“禹闻善言则拜”，“子路闻过则喜”；这拜，这喜，都是含有这两方面的高兴在内。而三省吾身更是个人修养的事，与大众事业毫不相干。曾子每日三省是：“为人谋而不忠乎？与朋友交而不信乎？传不习乎？”全是为自己打算，而不是反省自己今天究竟对大众的事业起了什么好作用，或是坏作用。一句话，无论是对己对人，全是对个人或私人关系而发。
    由于这种对己对人都是为个人打算的原故，所以在旧日劝善规过和三省吾身并不是结合在一起的，而是截然分开的两件事。
    至于我们今天的批评、自我批评呢，却是从对大众事业负责出发，知己朋友做错了事固然要批评，就是“点头之交”的朋友，如果发现了他做错了事也要批评。这批评，一方面不仅是为他们打算，希望他们好起来，更重要的却是因为他们做错了这事，将影响革命利益，为了革命利益，才进行批评的。而在被批评的这一方面呢，自然也应该高兴，这高兴是因为得到了这批评，可以使自己少对革命犯些错误，也不仅是为了自己。同时也高兴批评者对革命负责，决不能认作批评者只是从个人恩怨出发，去计较对方是爱护自己，或是打击自己。自我批评也是如此，三省吾身的办法也未始不可以用，但这省，也应该是反省自己这一天对革命利益起了些什么好作用或是坏作用，而不是只从自己个人出发，反省一些与革命利益无关的个人私事。
    由于对己对人都是为革命事业打算的原故，所以在进行的时候，批评与自我批评是结合在一起的，决不能截然分开。
    这就是劝善规过、三省吾身与批评、自我批评的区别，这区别是由于两个不同社会而产生的，如若断章取义，随便用用，自无不可。但若混为一谈，就会发生误解，那却是极不妥当的。
