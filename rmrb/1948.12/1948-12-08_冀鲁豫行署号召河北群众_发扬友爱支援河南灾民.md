　　Ji-Lu-Yu Administrative Office Calls on Hebei Masses
  　Promote Friendship and Support Henan Disaster Victims
    [Ji-Lu-Yu Telegram] The Ji-Lu-Yu Administrative Office recently issued a circular calling on the masses in various counties of Hebei to promote the spirit of friendship and resettle Henan disaster victims. The circular pointed out: The people of Henan have suffered long-term devastation and destruction from the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, and some areas were flooded in the autumn, making life very difficult. The masses in Hebei should ideologically recognize that the people of Henan have stood on the front lines of the People's Liberation War and fought for two years. Because they supported the victory of the People's Liberation War and persisted in guerrilla warfare, Hebei has enjoyed a relatively stable environment. Therefore, the people of all counties in Hebei should conscientiously take care of and resettle Henan disaster victims, such as introducing them to jobs, helping them organize production, or lending them housing and furniture. They should also raise some clothing and food items, such as radish tops, to prevent them from suffering from hunger and cold.

　　冀鲁豫行署号召河北群众
  　发扬友爱支援河南灾民
    【冀鲁豫电】冀鲁豫行署顷特发出通令，号召河北各县群众，发挥友爱精神安置河南灾民。通令指出：河南人民因长期遭受蒋匪的摧残与破坏，秋季某些地区又遭水淹，生活非常困难。河北群众应从思想上认清，河南群众站在人民解放战争的前线，奋斗了两年，由于他们支援人民解放战争胜利，坚持游击战，使河北得到相当安定的环境。因此我河北各县人民，应认真照顾安置河南灾民，例如介绍职业，帮助组织生产或借给房住，借给家具使，并应募集些衣食物品，如红萝卜缨子之类，以免其遭受饥饿寒冷。
