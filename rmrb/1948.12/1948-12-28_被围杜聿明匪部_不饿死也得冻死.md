Xinhua News Agency, Huaihai Front, December 26th: The Du Yuming bandit troops, tightly surrounded northeast of Yongcheng by the People's Liberation Army, are suffering from hunger and cold. On the 19th, it rained, and the days have been filled with mist, cutting off enemy aircraft. After the rain, it is severely cold, and heavy snow is expected. Most of the enemy troops abandoned their cotton-padded clothes and quilts when they fled west from Xuzhou. If the bandit troops do not surrender, they will freeze to death even if they don't starve. According to surrendered and captured officers and soldiers, corpses are lying everywhere within the encirclement, and no one is burying them; wounded and starving soldiers are rolling and crawling on the ground, groaning and moaning, and no one cares. The starving bandit troops are now mainly relying on slaughtering livestock to survive. The 103rd Regiment of the 5th Army stipulates that slaughtering one donkey should provide one day's worth of food for 130 people. Veteran soldiers eat meat, while new recruits can only gnaw on bones. The regiment had seized 29 donkeys while fleeing from Xuzhou, and they have now all been eaten. Past facts have proven that so-called airdrops are practically useless, and incidents of enemies shooting at each other over airdropped supplies occur frequently. In a struggle at Yangyaozhuang on the 8th, more than 100 people were killed or wounded. Water is also running out, and many people are now filtering horse urine to drink. Fuel is also extremely scarce, and livestock saddles, broken car frames, and other flammable objects are being used as firewood. As the encirclement tightens day by day, it is extremely crowded with people and horses. In the center of the encirclement, a small ditch running from Wangzhuang to Huzhuang is filled with ammunition, vehicles, and tens of thousands of people and horses. One day, a shell fired by the People's Liberation Army artillery landed directly on two ammunition trucks in the ditch, instantly killing or wounding more than 100 people. The bandit troops' headquarters move two or three times a day, but are still not safe. On the 9th, the People's Liberation Army artillery hit Du Yuming's command post. In recent days, Du has been driving those hungry and cold remnants, attempting to break through in vain, moving the troops east and then west, turning around in that small circle like a millstone. People crash into vehicles, horses trample on each other, it's a chaotic mess. The result of the enemy's attempted breakthroughs is that they not only cannot escape the PLA's iron ring, but also suffer a large reduction in personnel due to casualties and desertions. The organization of many regiments, battalions, and companies is now just an empty shell. There are bachelor battalion commanders and bachelor company commanders. A company of the 133rd Regiment of the so-called "ace" 5th Army has only twelve people in total, and of those, seven are the company commander, special agent chief, quartermaster, clerk, and three platoon leaders, while the remaining five are old civilians who were captured on the road in Xiaoxian and have only been wearing military uniforms for a few days. The two regiments of the 137th Division of the 70th Army also had only a few dozen people left after their third attempt to break through at Lulou. Now, the following saying has gradually spread among Du's lower-ranking officers and soldiers: "If you don't join the Eighth Route Army, you'll only die." After being captured, a second lieutenant clerk from Sun Yuanliang's Corps Headquarters voluntarily returned to the bandit troops and said to the officers and soldiers, "The People's Liberation Army treats us very well and has already prepared food for us. If you want to live, come with me!" More than a hundred bandit officers and soldiers followed him to surrender to the People's Liberation Army.

Xinhua News Agency, Huaihai Front, December 26th: With the full support of the people of the North China, East China, and Central Plains Liberated Areas, the People's Liberation Army on the Huaihai Front has ample food. Large quantities of rice, white flour, and millet are being continuously transported to the front from all over. When the field commanders and fighters eat the snow-white rice, white flour, and golden millet, they sincerely thank the people of the Liberated Areas for their love. To ensure that the troops have sufficient supplies during the severe winter rain and snow, the logistics organs of the East China Field Army have agreed with the war service organs of Shandong, Central China, YuwanSu, and JiluYu Liberated Areas to rush large quantities of grain to the front day and night, and plan to purchase large quantities of vegetables and fat pigs for the troops. Currently, clothing factories in various liberated areas are rushing to produce and transport large quantities of cotton-padded clothes and quilts to supplement the newly liberated Kuomintang officers and soldiers. The PLA's life of eating well and dressing warmly is in stark contrast to the hunger and cold of the surrounded Chiang bandit Du Yuming's troops.

### 被围杜聿明匪部　不饿死也得冻死

　　被围杜聿明匪部
  　不饿死也得冻死
    【新华社淮海前线二十六日电】被解放军紧紧包围于永城东北的杜聿明匪部，正在饥寒交迫。此间十九日下雨，连日云雾迷蒙，敌机断绝。雨后严寒，且将下大雪。大部敌军自徐州西逃时，即已丢掉棉衣棉被。匪军如不投降，不饿死也将要冻死。据投诚及被俘的官兵称：包围圈内到处僵卧着尸体，无人掩埋；负伤的及饿得将死的士兵，就在地上滚着爬着，哀号呻吟，无人过问。饥饿的匪军，现在主要靠宰杀牲口过日。第五军一零三团，规定宰一条毛驴要分配一百三十个人作一天的食料。老兵吃肉，新兵只能啃点骨头。该团曾在从徐州溃逃途中抢得毛驴二十九条，现已全部吃光。过去事实证明：所谓飞机空投实际毫不顶事，敌人因争夺那点空投物资而互相开枪火并的事，时常发生。八日杨窑庄的一场争夺，即伤亡一百多人。水也被喝得快干了，现已有许多人滤马尿作饮料。烧的也万分困难，牲口的驮鞍，汽车的破架及其他可燃的物体，都拿来当柴烧。由于包围圈一天比一天缩紧，人马拥挤不堪。在包围圈的中心从王庄通胡庄的一条小河沟里，充满了弹药、汽车和成万的人马。有一天，解放军炮兵发出的炮弹，一颗正落在这沟里的两辆弹药车上，一下被炸死炸伤了一百多人。匪军各首脑机关，每天都要搬家两三次，但仍不保险。九日，解放军的大炮击中了杜聿明的指挥部。最近几天，杜匪又驱使着那些饥寒交迫的残兵败将，妄图突围，忽而把部队拉到东，忽而又扯到西，在那小圈子里象推磨似的转来转去。人与车相撞，马与马相踏，乱得一团糟。敌人如此突围的结果，不仅逃不出解放军的铁圈，反使兵员因伤亡与逃亡而大量减少。许多团、营、连的建制，已只剩下一付空架子。有光棍营长，光棍连长。号称“王牌”第五军一三三团的一个连，一共只有十二个人，且其中除七人是连长、特务长、军需、文书和三个排长外，其余五人又都是在萧县路上被抓来的老百姓，穿上军服才几天。七十军一三七师的两个团，在第三次向鲁楼突围之后，也只剩下几十个人了。现在，杜匪的下级官兵家中已渐渐传开这样一句话：“不投八路，只有死路。”孙元良兵团司令部一少尉书记官被俘后又自动回去对匪军官兵说：“解放军待我们很好，已经给我们准备好饭了。要想活命的就跟我走吧！”一百多名匪军官兵就跟着他来向解放军投诚了。
    【新华社淮海前线二十六日电】在华北、华东及中原三大解放区人民全力支援下，淮海前线解放军粮食充裕。大量的大米、白面、小米正由各地源源不断的运抵前方。战地指战员吃着雪白的大米、白面和金黄的小米时，莫不衷心感谢解放区人民对他们的热爱。为保证在严冬雨雪期间部队给养充足，华东野战军后勤机关已与山东、华中、豫皖苏、冀鲁豫各解放区的各战争勤务机关商定日夜赶运大批粮食送往前线，并计划为部队采办大批蔬菜及肥猪。现解放区各地被服工厂，正赶制赶运大批棉衣棉被，补充给新解放的国民党官兵。解放军的这种吃得饱、穿得暖的生活，与当面被围之蒋匪杜聿明部官兵饥寒交迫的情形，恰成一强烈的对照。
