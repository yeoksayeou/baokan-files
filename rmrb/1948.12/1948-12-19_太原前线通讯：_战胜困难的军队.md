Taiyuan Frontline Communication:
    An Army That Overcomes Difficulties
    He Wei
    Hushan, twenty-five kilometers east of Taiyuan, is a stronghold known as "Iron Taiyuan." This area is more than 1,800 meters above sea level and mostly consists of cliffs and precipices. The roads on the mountains are as narrow as ribbons, with a thousand-foot-deep gully on one side. Our army began to eliminate Yan's bandit troops from here. Not only does capturing a fortress area require a fierce battle, but even occupying a hill or depression inevitably leads to fierce fighting. The mountain range extends to the eastern suburbs of Taiyuan, rising directly eastward from the suburbs of Taiyuan, one step higher than the other. In the overcast weather, we are practically fighting in the clouds. The enemy's fortifications become stronger the closer they are to the suburbs, so the further down we fight, the more difficulties we encounter. But no matter how difficult the hardships are, the several red arrows on the staff's map always maintain a head-to-head advance, compressing the enemy into a small area in the suburbs.
    For example, on November 4th, a certain unit of our army broke into the enemy's flank from between two of their firing positions. The enemy strictly sealed off an exposed section of road with firepower, completely cutting off our communication with the follow-up troops! The Ninth Company of the Sixth Regiment was ordered to build a trench on this section of road, with earthwork operations to be carried out under artillery fire. This difficult task had to be completed tonight, but everyone believed it could be done because: "The Fifth Regiment can pass, why can't we work?!" Indeed, no one showed any sign of fear! As soon as the first platoon began earthwork operations, a new difficulty arose. On the slope inclined towards the enemy, there was slate under a thin layer of soil. The pickaxes and shovels struck, making a clanging sound and sparks flying. The distance from the enemy was only three hundred meters. Given the urgency of time and the situation, how could a trench be dug on the stone slope? The platoon leader suddenly ordered: "Quick, go get sacks from the back!" The sacks were filled with soil from the foot of the mountain, carried up one by one, and then stacked up one by one. Stacking one section would be destroyed by enemy shells, so they rebuilt it. If one layer couldn't hold, they built two layers. "Hurry! Fill it up quickly! The faster you fill, the faster we carry!" In more than two hours, a thirty-five-meter-long trench, built by the hands of twenty-four heroes, was finally constructed on the stone slope under enemy fire.
    War is conducted in such difficulties, and everything is difficult. However, we are people who never bow our heads to difficulties, and we will definitely overcome them!
    Several narrow mountain gullies became very lively. People carrying water arranged their buckets in rows or drove herds of horses to drink water, in an orderly manner, without arguing or fighting. Some lifted stones, some dug up sand, and the mountain water slowly seeped out. Water was scarce, but instead of implementing "rationing," they tried to dig wells to increase the water source. Cook Liu Yuegui passed through the enemy's fire blockade to deliver hot boiled water to the front lines on time. After the soldiers drank, Liu Yuegui did not return. When someone asked him why, Liu Yuegui replied: "The comrades on sentry duty at the front haven't come back yet. They work even harder. How can they do without hot water? I'll leave after they drink it."
    The weather gradually turned cold, and the cooks of the troops made a guarantee: hot meals and hot soup on the front lines. Comrade Wang Jun of a certain unit thought of many ways to achieve it. He bought kerosene barrels, burned a fire underneath, and placed a pot of vegetables on top. The rice buckets were wrapped in cotton bags, so they wouldn't get cold even after walking dozens of miles. The variety of food was also unique. A ballad of a certain unit's Ninth Company specially recorded this scene: "Since the start of the campaign, there's no end to the variety of food, steamed rice, soft rice cakes, rice and flour balls, fried dough sticks, sweet potatoes steamed with rice, buckwheat dumplings, red dates and bean flour buns, white flour river noodles, bean noodles, no repetition for ten days; not only does the rice not repeat, but the vegetables are also cooked especially fragrant; good food and good vegetables, not to mention, there's also spicy soup after the meal. When soldiers mention the cooking squad, no one doesn't praise them. Fan Youcai, the deputy squad leader, works actively and isn't afraid of being busy, he bravely volunteers to deliver food to the positions, doesn't panic when passing through the blockade, to let the soldiers eat hot meals, he dresses the rice buckets in clothes..." The people in the eastern mountains, after being plundered by the Japanese puppets and Yan's bandits, were extremely poor and could not buy any daily necessities. Before the Thirteenth Detachment launched its attack, it wrote many detailed supply programs into its work schedule, and even the smallest matters were considered. Unified supply work, organized livestock transportation, constantly seeing groups of three or five people who did not spare their hard work on the rugged mountain roads, urging their livestock to transport large quantities of oil, salt, and vegetables to the front lines from hundreds of miles away, this was something that had not been seen in the Yuncheng, Linfen, and Jinzhong campaigns, the most laborious organizational work.
    Not only are there no large villages in the eastern mountains, but there are also few mountain strongholds or shacks, making it impossible to accommodate large troop groups. The people already have difficulty with housing, and the People's Liberation Army must protect the interests of the masses and cannot let them compress their houses or occupy factories, hindering recovery work. Instead, everyone works together to dig cave dwellings. Now, many cave dwellings are hidden under the ridges, as well as grenade throwing fields, reading desks, and toilet facilities, all neat and clean, and more in line with the requirements of war. The local people live in warm houses and feel very sorry. Liu Sangou was afraid that the people's soldiers would be cold, so he carried a bundle of dry grass to the cave dwelling for the soldiers to sleep on. Everyone's heart is the same: for the victory of the war. A brand-new American-made walkie-talkie was erected in a mine pit no more than one meter high, with the antenna pulled out from the crevices of the rocks. The telegram from the person in charge of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China commenting on the Chinese military situation was transmitted from here to the trenches. "Have you heard what Chairman Mao said? Comrades: Intensify your efforts! To finally and completely eliminate the reactionary forces." It immediately became the oath and action of the People's Liberation Army soldiers!
    Many winding paths have been stepped out on the mountains, and occasionally there are one or two wider ones. Along the main road are posters and slogans, one of which reads: "The artillery must go up the mountain, building roads is also to eliminate Yan Xishan." This was to encourage the road construction workers at the time. Modern warfare, conducted in mountainous areas, is full of sudden and unexpected events. A certain column's Second Company was going to complete a combat mission. The field gun vehicles accelerated forward. A steep slope appeared in front of them, not a slope, but a cliff. The engineers used explosives to open the road, and the laborers rushed to repair it in the back. The gunners and drivers pulled on the tail of the gun, but it still rolled down. But many difficult roads, every footprint, points in one direction - to fight to Taiyuan.
    At a certain height, there are several large field guns, stretching their necks, controlling the Taiyuan West Airport. From the flanks or the front, the roads are so small that it is absolutely impossible for two gun carriage wheels to move. It actually squatted in this dangerous place. How it got up there, we wanted to discover this miracle, but we never found it.
    How happy are those who overcome difficulties! The Sixth Company of a certain unit twisted the Yangko dance onto the battlefield. They played "Yan Xishan riding a donkey," and when the artillery fired, he fell from the donkey and died. Without musical instruments, they knocked on their work tools, causing everyone to laugh. Door panel newspapers were also published. Each squad of a certain unit has one, the main forms being ballads and pictures, the content being to review tactics and techniques, and to carry out commendations and criticisms. More than half of the commanders and fighters are active correspondents for the door panel newspapers. The engineering company wrote a ditty describing the life of the eastern Shanxi battlefield - "Overcoming Difficulties":
    "Take down Taiyuan and capture Yan Xishan alive, the People's Liberation Army camps on the high mountains, comrades, look, the mountains are high and the roads are small, the mountains and fields are full of yellow uniforms.
    "Our Third Platoon's Eighth Squad Leader is smart and resourceful, really beautiful, uses pieces of stone, he uses to burn dry food, overcomes difficulties, a good example!
    "We dig our own water, chop our own firewood, dig our own wells, build our own cave dwellings, no need for workers to build, clay candlesticks illuminate the earthen cave dwellings!
    "Steel helmets can be used to knead dough and boil water, straw curtains are really good for blocking the wind, we carry our own coal, burn the stove in the cave, all difficulties, we overcome!"
    All of this is the glorious tradition of the Liberation Army being able to overcome difficulties, and it also contains unlimited power to defeat the enemy!

　　太原前线通讯：
    战胜困难的军队
    何微
    在太原以东二十五公里的罕山，被称为“铁的太原”的要塞地带，此地拔海一千八百多公尺，多是悬崖绝壁，山上的道路，狭窄的象一条带子一样，一边又临千英尺的深沟，我军就从这里开始消灭阎匪部队。不仅夺取一个堡垒区，要经过一场恶战，甚至占领一个山丘或凹道，也必然发生激烈战斗。山脉延伸到太原东郊，由太原城郊向东直上，一步高过一步，在阴霾的天气里，我们简直是在云端作战。而敌人的工事构筑，越靠近城郊就越坚固，因此我们越往下打，困难就越多。但不论如何的艰难困苦，参谋部地图上的几个红色箭头，常保持齐头并进，将敌人压缩到城郊狭小地区。
    譬如：十一月四日，我军某部从敌人两个火力阵地的当中，突入其侧后，敌人把暴露的一段道路用火力严密封锁住，使我与后续部队的交通，完全隔绝起来！六联队九连，受命在这一段道路上构筑一条交通壕，土工作业须在炮火下进行。而这个困难的任务又必须在今夜完成，但大家相信是可以完成的，因为：“五联队能通过，咱们有什么不能工作！？”的确，没有一个人表示畏难之色！一排开始土工作业，新的困难就来了，在向敌人倾斜的坡上，一层薄薄的土下面，便是片岩，十字镐和铁铣敲下去，叮叮当当冒起火星，相距敌人又只三百公尺，时间和情况的紧急，石坡上如何能挖交通壕呢？排长突然命令：“快去后边拿麻袋来！”从山坡下装上土，一袋一袋往上扛，再一袋一袋垒起来，垒一段被敌人炮弹摧垮一段，于是又重新垒，一层抗不住垒两层。“快呀！快装！你们装多快，我们扛多快！”两个多钟头的时间，一条长三十五公尺的交通壕，经过二十四个英雄的手，终于在敌人炮火封锁下的石坡上筑起来。
    战争就是在这种困难中进行的，举凡一切，也都是困难的。可是，我们是从来不向困难低头的人，就一定战胜困难！
    若干狭小的山沟里，变得非常热闹，挑水的人，把水桶排列成行，或是赶来马群饮水，秩序井然，不争不吵，有的掀起石块，有的挖开砂子，山水便慢慢地渗出来。水是缺乏的，但并不因此实行“配给”，而是设法掏井，增多水源。炊事员刘月桂，通过敌人火力封锁线，按时将热开水送到阵地上，战士们喝好了，刘月桂还不回去，有人问他这是什么原因，刘月桂回答说：“前面放哨的几个同志还没有回来，他们更辛苦，不喝开水怎能行呢？让他们喝了开水我再走”。
    气候逐渐冷起来，部队的炊事员提出保证：火线上吃热饭喝热汤，某部王俊同志想许多办法来实现它。他买下火油桶，下面烧上火，上面放菜锅，饭桶用棉袋包裹起来，走几十里不会冷。饭的花样也是别出心裁，某部九连有一段快板专纪载这种情景的：“自从战役一开始，伙食花样说不了，大米闷饭软米糕，米面丸子炸油条，红薯闷米荞面饺，红枣豆子面粉包，白面河洛豆面条，十天样子重不了；不只吃饭不重样，菜还炒的特别香；好菜好饭这不讲，饭后还有糊辣汤。战士提起炊事班，没有一个不夸奖。范有才，副班长，工作积极不怕忙，阵地送饭报奋勇，通过封锁不慌张，为了战士吃热饭，他给饭桶穿衣裳……”。东山群众经过日伪阎匪的掠夺，穷苦不堪，生活用品，什么都买不到。十三支队在进攻以前，就把许多供给的详细节目写在工作日程中，细微事情也被考虑到了。统一供给工作，组织牲口运输，在崎岖的山路上不断见到三五成群不辞辛劳的人，吆喝着牲口从百里之外，运大批油盐蔬菜到前线上，这是运城、临汾、晋中战役所未有，最费力的组织工作。
    东山不但没有大的村落，就是山庄窝铺也不多，容纳大兵团的居住根本不可能。群众住的房子已经困难，人民解放军要保护群众利益并不能让他们紧缩房屋，或占据工厂，妨碍恢复工作。而是大家动手来打窑洞，现在有许许多多的窑洞藏在垄坎下，还有投弹场，读书桌，厕所设备，都一样整齐清洁，更合乎战争的要求。当地群众住着暖房子，心里很抱歉，刘三狗深怕人民的战士受冻，背了一捆干草送到窑洞里给战士铺。彼此的心都一样：为着战争的胜利。一部最新美国造的报话机，就架设在高不过一公尺的矿坑中，天线从石缝中牵出来。中共中央负责人的评论中国军事形势的电报，就从这里传到战壕里去。“毛主席的话你们听见了吗？同志们：加紧努力！才能最后地完全地消灭反动势力”。立刻变成人民解放军战士的誓言和行动！
    山上，踩出很多湾湾曲曲的小路，偶然也有一两条宽阔的，沿大路贴着传单标语，有一张上写着：“大炮要上山，修路也为消灭阎锡山”。这是鼓励当时参加修路民工的。现代化的战争，在山地进行，充满着突然的意外的事件，某纵队二连要去完成一次战斗任务，野炮车加快的往前赶，面前出现了一段兜坡，不是坡，而是绝壁，工兵便用爆破开路，民工就在后边抢修，炮手驭手扯住炮尾，还是滚滚而下，但许多艰苦的路，每个脚印，都指着一个方向——打到太原去。
    某处高地，有几尊大野炮，伸长脖子，控制太原西飞机场。从侧翼，或者是正面，路细小的绝不可能容许两个炮车轮子运动，它竟然蹲在这个险要地方，是怎样上来的，我们要发现这个奇迹，终于没有找到。
    战胜困难的人，是何等愉快！某部六连，把秧歌舞，扭到战场上，他们扮演“阎锡山骑毛驴”，大炮一响，便从毛驴身上摔下，跌死了。没有乐器，便敲起作业工具，惹的大家哄哄大笑。门板报也出版了。某部每班都有一块，主要形式是快板和图画，内容是检讨战术技术，进行表扬批评。有半数以上的指战员，是门板报的积极通讯员。工兵连写了描写东山战地生活的——“战胜困难”的小调：
    “打下太原活捉阎锡山，解放军高山扎营盘，同志们你瞧，山高路又小，满山遍野黄呀黄衣裳。
    “咱们三排八呀八班长，智多谋广真漂亮，利用石头片，他来烧干粮，克服困难，好呀好榜样！
    “自己吃水自己把掏，自己打柴自己烧井，窑洞自己挖，不用工人造，泥捏灯盏，照亮土窑窑！
    “钢盔和面又能把水烧，草帘挡风实在好，自己把煤挑，窑里火炉烧，一切困难，战呀战胜了！”
    这一切都是解放军能够战胜困难的光荣传统，也蕴蓄着无限战胜敌人的力量！
