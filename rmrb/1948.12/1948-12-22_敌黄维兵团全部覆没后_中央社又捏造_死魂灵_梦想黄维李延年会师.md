Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 19th. After the Huang Wei Corps was annihilated on the evening of the 15th, and Huang Wei himself was captured alive, the Kuomintang Central News Agency claimed that the corps had "joined forces" with the Li Yannian Corps on the afternoon of the 16th, and on the 18th, it "completely shattered" the PLA's "deep blockade positions" and was using its main force to "pursue north." The story of the "dead souls" and living prisoners of the annihilated Kuomintang army "joining forces" with their reinforcements in the writing rooms of the Kuomintang Central News Agency and winning other "victories" is not new. Not long ago, the Kuomintang announced Liao Yaoxiang's "victory," and then particularly forcefully announced Huang Botao's "victory." The Central News Agency, which is good at making soldiers out of paper cuttings, announced on the 24th, after Huang Botao's corps was annihilated in the Nianzhuang area on the 22nd of last month and Huang Botao himself died of serious injuries, that the corps "joined forces with the eastward advancing corps at Daxujia this afternoon." The Kuomintang Central Propaganda Department even published an editorial entitled "The Victory of the Xuzhou Campaign." However, on the 6th and 7th of this month, the same Kuomintang Central News Agency and the same Kuomintang Central Propaganda Department suddenly published news and editorials saying that Huang Botao had "generously committed suicide after fighting to the last man." When Huang Wei's corps was besieged this time, the Central News Agency announced as early as the 23rd of last month that the corps had "arrived at Suxian at 1:00 this morning" and shook hands with the Li Yannian corps advancing north from Renqiao at noon. Now the paper figures and paper horses of Huang Wei's corps are said to have "joined forces" with the Li Yannian corps for the second time. But Li Yannian has already fled back south of the Huai River, and Huang Wei is nowhere to be seen. What should be done? The Central News Agency's bragging king decided to order this prisoner to abandon the reinforcements after "joining forces" and bravely "pursue north," so that he could "pursue" without a trace, or "generously commit suicide" someday. Of course, pointing out the bankruptcy of these Kuomintang propaganda efforts will absolutely not make them fabricate fewer rumors, or make the rumor-mongers feel a bit ashamed. No, this is absolutely impossible. They are not afraid of bankruptcy, because they have already gone bankrupt countless times. Although some people say that reputation is a second life, for the Kuomintang reactionaries who do not know if they will be alive tomorrow, rumors have become their first life.
    
Xinhua News Agency, Huaihai Front, 20th. While the Kuomintang rumor company, the Central News Agency, was fabricating the myth of "Huang Wei and Li Yannian's two corps successfully joining forces" for days, Huang Wei was taken prisoner, and the Li Yannian corps ran at a speed of 100 li per day to the Bengbu to Linhuaiguan area south of the Huai River. This time, Li Yannian led three armies and eight divisions, along with Liu Ruming's three armies and seven divisions of follow-up troops, and set out from Bengbu to Caolaoji between the 2nd of this month in a northwesterly direction. At that time, Chiang Kai-shek ordered Li Yannian to pass through a distance of about 110 li and "join forces" with Huang Wei within a week. However, due to the PLA's tenacious resistance, until Huang Wei's troops were annihilated on the 15th, Li Yannian's troops climbed to the Heji and Baojiaji line northwest of Caolaoji, advancing less than 50 li, more than 60 li away from Shuangduiji. The average daily travel was less than four li. At this point, except for the remnants of Du Yuming's two corps besieged in the narrow area northeast of Yongcheng, there were no enemy traces north of the Huai River.

　　敌黄维兵团全部覆没后
    中央社又捏造“死魂灵”梦想黄维李延年会师
    【新华社陕北十九日电】在黄维兵团于十五日晚被歼灭，黄维本人被活捉以后，国民党中央社宣称该兵团已于十六日下午与李延年兵团“会师”，并于十八日将解放军“纵深封锁阵地完全粉碎”，正以主力“向北追击”。被歼灭的国民党军队的“死魂灵”和活俘虏，在国民党中央社的写字楼上与其援军“会师”，并获得其他“胜利”的故事，这早已不是第一次了。不久以前，国民党宣布过廖耀湘的“胜利”，随后又特别用力地宣布过黄伯韬的“胜利”。善于剪纸成兵的中央社，在黄伯韬兵团已于上月二十二日在碾庄地区被歼灭，黄伯韬本人因重伤不治毙命以后，居然在二十四日宣称该兵团“今午已于大许家与东进兵团会师”，国民党中央宣传部还发表了一篇“徐州会战胜利结束”的社论。但是到了本月六日和七日，同一个国民党中央社和同一个国民党中央宣传部，忽然又发表新闻和社论，说黄伯韬已于“打到最后的一人乃慷慨自戕”。此次黄维兵团被围时，中央社早在上月二十三日就宣告该兵团“今晨一时进抵宿县”，正午与由任桥北进之李延年兵团握手。现在黄维兵团的纸人纸马据说又与李延年兵团第二次“会师”了。但是李延年已经逃回淮河以南，却不见黄维同来，这该怎么办呢？中央社的牛皮大王决定命令这个俘虏于“会师”以后又丢下援军，英勇地“向北追击”，以便从此“追击”得无影无踪，或者又在不知哪一天来一个“慷慨自戕”了事。当然，指出国民党的这些宣传的破产，绝对不能使他们少造谣，或者使造遥者们感觉有丝毫羞耻之心。不，这是绝对不可能的。他们并不害怕破产，因为他们早已破产了无数次。虽然有人说过名誉是第二生命，但是对于朝不保夕的国民党反动派，谣言却成为他们的第一生命了。
    【新华社淮海前线廿日电】在国民党谣言公司中央社连日制造“黄维、李延年两兵团已胜利会师”的神话时，黄维是当了俘虏，而李延年兵团则以每日一百里的速度跑到了淮河以南蚌埠至临淮关地区。这次李延年率领三个军八个师的兵力，连同刘汝明的三个军七个师的后继部队，从本月二日起自蚌埠至曹老集之间向西北方向进发。当时蒋介石曾命令李延年要在一个星期之内通过约一百一十里的距离与黄维“会师”。但是由于解放军的顽强阻击，直到十五日黄维部队被歼为止，李延年部又爬到曹老集西北何集、包家集一线，前进不足五十里，距双堆集尚有六十余里。每日行进平均不足四里。至此，淮河以北除了被包围在永城东北狭小地区的杜聿明两个兵团残部外，已经全无敌踪。
