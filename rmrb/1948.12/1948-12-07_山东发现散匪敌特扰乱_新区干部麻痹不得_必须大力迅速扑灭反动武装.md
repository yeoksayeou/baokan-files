(Reported by this newspaper) Serious incidents of scattered bandits and hidden enemy agents disrupting social order have occurred in a newly established county (marked as ×× county) west of the Yellow River in Shandong. In the two months since liberation, there have been more than 30 banditry cases, 113 people kidnapped, 10 rifles stolen, 79 head of cattle stolen, and over 1 million yuan in funds stolen. There were also acts of sabotage such as stealing cabbages and burning wheat stacks. This is due to the complacency of local cadres who have forgotten the primary task in all new areas: to vigorously and swiftly eliminate reactionary armed forces. Currently, local Party, government, and military cadres have organized the masses and local armed forces to carry out the work of eliminating scattered bandits and enemy agents. This lesson should raise the vigilance of Party, government, military and civilians in newly liberated areas.

　　山东发现散匪敌特扰乱
  　新区干部麻痹不得
    必须大力迅速扑灭反动武装
    【本报讯】山东黄河西××县（新设县）新区，发生散匪和潜蔽特务扰乱社会秩序的严重现象。从解放到现在两月中已发生盗匪案件三十余起，绑架群众一百一十三人，抢去步枪十支，牛七十九头，款百余万元，那时有偷白菜、烧麦子垛等破坏事情。这是由于当地干部被胜利所麻痹，忘记了在一切新区必须用大力迅速消灭反动武装的首要任务。现在当地党政军干部已经组织群众和地方武装进行肃清散匪特务工作。这个教训，应引起新解放地区党政军民的警惕。
