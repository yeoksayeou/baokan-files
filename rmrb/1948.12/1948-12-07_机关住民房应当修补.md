　　Government Organizations Living in Civilian Houses Should Repair Them
    Due to Japanese destruction and burning, the civilian houses in Beicuyu, Lingshou, are dilapidated and have not been well repaired to this day. Because of the heavy rain this year, many more have collapsed. The government organizations living in the village only live there and do not pay attention to repairs. This has a bad influence and may lead to alienation from the masses. It is specifically suggested that all government organizations living in civilian houses in various places should take responsibility for repairs.

　　机关住民房应当修补
    由于日本的破坏和烧毁，灵寿北慈峪的民房已破旧不堪，至今仍未很好修补起来。因今年雨大，又倒塌很多，住在该村的机关，只是住，而不注意修补。这样影响不好，可能脱离群众。特建议各地住民房的所有机关，要负起补修责任。
    （周友人、王秉录）
