　　"Now We Can Focus on Production with Peace of Mind!"
  　Middle Peasants of Xiahuangtang Happily Share Their Thoughts
    [Taihang News] After the land reform was completed with compensation and resettlement in Xiahuangtang Village, Licheng, a new atmosphere of joy and unity emerged in the countryside. All classes unanimously focus on production and getting rich. At the concluding land reform discussion meeting in the village, everyone happily revealed their innermost thoughts. When discussing their thoughts from last winter and this spring and their current feelings, they unanimously reflected that the policy of ending land reform was in line with the demands of the broad masses. Jin Laisuo said: "Last December, they wouldn't let me sell grain. I thought, did I become a 'target' (meaning a target of struggle)? I'll just eat as long as I can! I didn't dare eat or drink during the day, and at night I bought wine, closed the door, and secretly drank with my wife. I really regret it now." That day, he and others bought seven big white sheep together, planning to develop small-scale sheep farming, and planned to earn back the price of the sheep by producing alkali. Li Zizhen said: "Before, my idea was: drink wine as long as I have wine for the day. Now I think it's not okay not to save. I plan to sell the two pigs I'm raising now in December and buy half a cow, so I can plow the land well in the spring." Zhou Hezhi said: "My thoughts were really chaotic before. Mo Haiquan and I ate a thousand or so eggs in two months, what a waste! In the future, not only will I focus on production, but I'll even give up smoking!" Guo Xianzhen said: "I feel so happy! I plan to build my three northern brick rooms next year." Luo Hucheng's family of three has thirteen mu of good land. Last winter, he kept saying he wanted to sell it. Now that he understands the policy, not only does he not sell the land, but he also mixes a lot of bran into the coarsely ground flour. When others ask him, he says, "Saving it is for myself!" Guo Lantian, a middle peasant who was compensated and whose class status was re-determined, said: "Ending land reform is so good. In the future, I must save more. Thinking about the past, I really regret it. I once cut eight jin of pork at once, what a waste." ... Everyone discussed enthusiastically, saying that people's hearts have changed greatly! All the cadres are also actively and enthusiastically planning winter production. The armed forces instructor organized alkali production, the finance director led the opening of an oil mill, the cooperative director ran back and forth to find work for the labor animals, and the women also began to organize weaving. The whole village has a new atmosphere of production.

　　“以后可好好安心生产吧！”
  　下黄堂中农愉快谈心思
    【太行讯】黎城下黄堂村经过补偿安置结束了土改，农村呈现一种愉快团结的新空气，各阶层一致安心生产发家。该村在总结结束土改的漫谈会上，大家都愉快的吐露着心底话，谈到去冬今春的思想和现在的心情时，一致反映了结束土改政策之适合广大群众要求。靳来锁说：“年时腊月不叫我卖粮食，我想着难道成了‘对象’（意即斗争对象）啦？吃一天算一天吧！白天不敢吃喝，黑夜买上酒回家关上门和老婆偷喝，想起来真后悔。”当天他就和别人伙买了七只大白羊，打算发展小份羊，并计划在淋碱生产中赚回这羊价来。李子贞说：“以前我的主意是：一日有酒一日醉，现在想不积蓄些可不行。我打算把现在喂的两个猪到腊月卖了，买上半个牛，春天就能把地犁好。”周和枝说：“以前思想真混乱，我和莫海全，两个月光鸡蛋就吃了千把个，真是浪费了！以后不但要好好生产，我连纸烟也不吸拉！”郭献珍说：“我思想可痛快啦！明年打算盖起我那三间北楼房。”洛虎成家三口人有十三亩好地，去冬直说要卖，现在明白了政策，不但不卖地，磨粗面还掺许多糠，别人问他，他说：“省下是自己的！”补偿和改订成份的中农郭兰田说：“结束土改就是这样好，以后可要多节省些，想起过去真后悔，我一次就割了八斤猪肉，真是瞎干。”……大家议论纷纷，都说人心大变啦！各干部也积极热情的计划冬季生产。武装指导员组织了淋碱，财政主任领导开油坊，合作社长来回跑着给劳畜力找脚，妇女们也开始组织纺织，全村一片生产新气象。  　　　　　　　　（师丕珍、郭玉琴）
