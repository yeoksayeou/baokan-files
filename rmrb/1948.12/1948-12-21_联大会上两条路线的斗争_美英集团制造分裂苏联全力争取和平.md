The struggle between two lines at the UN General Assembly
    US-British Group Creates Division, Soviet Union Makes Every Effort to Win Peace

The Third United Nations General Assembly, which opened on September 21, adjourned on the 12th of this month. This General Assembly demonstrated a fierce struggle between two different lines. One line, led by the Soviet Union and other democratic countries, aimed to strengthen the United Nations and defend international peace and democracy. The other line, led by the imperialist forces headed by the United States, aimed to undermine peace and democracy and to turn the United Nations into a docile tool for its aggressive policies. During the nearly three-month meeting, the representatives of the Soviet Union and the new democratic countries thoroughly exposed and countered the US-British group's conspiracy to undermine peace and democracy before world public opinion, and struck at their attempt to reduce the United Nations to a registration agency for their aggressive policies, thus winning a moral and political victory. On the third day of the General Assembly, Soviet delegation leader Vyshinsky's speech denouncing the US-British reactionaries' preparations for war, and the proposal to ban atomic weapons and for the five major powers to disarm by one-third within a year, won the praise and support of the broad masses of people around the world, putting the US-British representatives in a difficult position, so that they dared not openly oppose including the Soviet proposal on the agenda of the General Assembly. Under the pressure of the world's democratic forces led by the Soviet Union, the meeting rejected on the 4th of this month the proposal by the US stooge Argentine representative to broadly restrict the veto power, and adopted a resolution calling on the major powers to resume their efforts to establish lasting peace, reaffirming the principle of international cooperation proclaimed in the Yalta Agreement. This was a victory for world justice and public opinion. However, on the other hand, under the "majority" control of the US-British group, this General Assembly not only rejected many just proposals by the Soviet Union to ban atomic weapons and disarm to strengthen international peace, but also adopted a series of reactionary resolutions that damaged the reputation of the United Nations, harmed the cause of peace, and approved the criminal acts of the United States in invading and enslaving the people of other countries. On the 8th and 4th of this month, the General Assembly passed resolutions that violated the Charter by requiring the Security Council to abolish the principle of unanimity among the great powers on the issue of admitting new members, and extending the "Little General Assembly". The resolution passed on November 4, which based the international control of atomic energy program on the US Baruch Plan, recognized the right of the United States to manufacture atomic bombs without restraint. In addition, the two resolutions extending the "Balkan Committee" for another year and recognizing the Syngman Rhee puppet regime as the "only legitimate government of Korea" gave the United States legal status to continue interfering in Greece's internal affairs and enslaving the Korean people.

After a considerable period of brewing and preparation, the Unity Congress of the Polish Workers' Party and the Socialist Party opened in Warsaw on the 15th of this month, and the merger of the two major workers' parties in Poland has been successfully completed. From now on, the unity of the Polish working class is even closer and more consolidated, and the division in the ranks of the Polish working class for half a century is gone forever. To date, the Communist Parties and Socialist Parties of six European countries, including Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Germany, and Poland, have successively merged into unified workers' parties. This fact shows that in the post-war world's workers' ranks, Marxism-Leninism is overcoming reformism and nationalism, and the workers' class unity movement is overcoming the workers' class division movement.

In the past week, there have also been the following major international events:
    (1) The 2.5 million workers and staff in the Moscow Oblast and the city of Moscow wrote a letter to Stalin, reporting that they had completed this year's production plan ahead of schedule, and vowed to strive to complete the Five-Year Plan in three and a half years in terms of industrial production levels. This month's fifth was the 12th anniversary of the Stalin Constitution, and the Soviet Union and the new democratic countries of Eastern Europe warmly celebrated the festival of the world's most progressive constitution.
    (2) The Soviet government and the Czechoslovak government delegation held negotiations and meetings, and discussed in detail the relations between the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia and other relevant international situation issues. Both sides have decided to further develop bilateral economic cooperation. The volume of mutual trade in 1949 will increase by 45 percent compared with 1948.
    (3) The Soviet Union and Italy signed an agreement on compensation issues and a treaty of trade and navigation. The three-year trade agreement stipulates a plan for the exchange of goods worth approximately 90 billion Italian lire between the two parties within three years.

### 联大会上两条路线的斗争　美英集团制造分裂苏联全力争取和平

　　联大会上两条路线的斗争
    美英集团制造分裂苏联全力争取和平
    九月二十一日开幕的第三届联合国大会，已于本月十二日休会。这次大会表现了两条不同路线之间的激烈斗争，一条是以苏联为首的民主国家的路线，其目的在于力谋加强联合国和保卫国际和平与民主；一条是以美国为首的帝国主义势力的路线，其目的则在竭力破坏和平、民主与变联合国为其侵略政策的驯从工具。在将近三个月的会议中，苏联和新民主主义国家的代表们，在世界舆论之前彻底揭发和反击了美英集团破坏和平、民主的阴谋，打击了它们想把联合国降为其侵略政策注册机关的企图，因而赢得了道义上和政治上的胜利。在联大的第三天会上，苏联代表团团长维辛斯基痛斥美英反动派准备战争的演说，和禁止原子武器与五强一年内裁军三分之一的建议，博得了世界广大人民的赞扬和支持，使美英代表陷于窘境，以至不敢公开出来反对把苏联这一建议列入大会议程。在以苏联为首的世界民主力量的压力下，会议于本月四日否决了美国走狗阿根廷代表提出的广泛限制否决权的议案，并通过了呼吁各大国恢复其建立持久和平之努力的决议，重申了雅尔达协定所宣告的国际合作原则。这是世界正义舆论的一个胜利。但是另一方面，在美英集团把持“多数”的情况下，这次联大不仅否决了苏联禁止原子武器和裁军等许多加强国际和平的正义提案，而且通过了一连串的反动决议，这些决议损坏了联合国的声誉，违害了和平事业，批准了美国侵略和奴役他国人民的罪恶行为。大会于本月八日和四日，分别通过了违反宪章的要求安理会在新会员国入会问题上取消大国一致原则，以及延长“小型联大”的议案。十一月四日通过的以美国巴鲁区计划为国际管制原子能计划基础的议案，承认了美国有放手制造原子弹的权利。此外，延长“巴尔干委员会”一年、承认李承晚伪政权为“朝鲜唯一合法政府”的两项决议，则给了美国继续干涉希腊内政和奴役朝鲜人民的合法地位。
    经过相当时期的酝酿和准备，波兰工人党与社会党的统一大会，已于本月十五日在华沙开幕，至此，波兰两大工人政党的合并事业，已胜利完成。从今以后，波兰工人阶级的团结是更加密切和巩固了，半世纪来波兰工人阶级队伍中的分裂状况，是一去不复返了，到目前为止，欧洲已有罗、匈、保、捷、德、波六个国家的共产党和社会党，先后合并为统一的工人党。这个事实，表示在战后世界工人队伍中，马克思列宁主义正在克服着改良主义和民族主义，工人阶级的统一运动正在克服着工人阶级的分裂运动。
    过去一周国际上尚有如下几件大事：
    （一）苏联莫斯科州和莫斯科市的二百五十万职工写信给斯大林，报告他们已提前完成今年的生产计划，并宣誓在工业生产水平方面，争取三年半完成五年计划。本月五日是斯大林宪法十二周年纪念，苏联和东欧新民主各国，均热烈庆祝这一世界上最进步的宪法的节日。
    （二）苏联政府与捷克斯洛伐克政府代表团举行谈判与会议，详细讨论了苏捷邦交及其他有关国际形势的问题。双方已决定进一步发展两国经济合作。一九四九年的相互贸易额，将比一九四八年增加百分之四十五。
    （三）苏联和意大利两国，签订了赔偿问题协定和贸易、航运条约。在为期三年的贸易协定中，规定了双方在三年内约九百亿意大利里拉的换货计划。
