Jizhong District Party Committee Directs All Localities
　　Rapidly Confirm Land Rights and Issue Land Certificates
[Jizhong Electric] "The end of land reform must be completed before the Lunar New Year. The central task for concluding land reform should be to quickly confirm land rights and issue land certificates, mobilizing the broad masses. Resolve the issues left over from land reform, and combine this with party rectification and other work." This is the core of the Jizhong District Party Committee of the Communist Party of China's instruction on December 6 regarding the winter conclusion of land reform work. The instruction pointed out: Issuing land certificates is the last important task to completely finish land reform, and it is of great significance for laying the foundation for major production in the coming spring. In some villages, the masses were quickly mobilized by starting with the issuance of land certificates; in some villages, the process of issuing land certificates promoted the enthusiasm of party members and cadres, enhanced their understanding of policies, achieved preliminary party rectification, shortened the time for concluding land reform, and addressed issues left over from land reform. All of this indicates that issuing land certificates is something that all levels are urgently in need of and concerned about. According to the degree of land redistribution in the district, the instruction divides villages into roughly three categories: First, those where land redistribution has been completed, or only minor adjustments are needed. These villages are the most numerous, accounting for about 5,000 villages across the district (excluding the tenth sub-district). Second, those where the land of landlords and rich peasants has been confiscated and requisitioned, but land rights have not yet been distributed and confirmed, and is only temporarily cultivated by peasant groups or individuals. Third, those villages that should undergo land reform but have not yet done so or where land reform is not thorough. The first type of village can start with issuing land certificates to conclude land reform, combined with party rectification and various other tasks. The second type of village can combine land distribution, confirmation of land rights, and issuance of land certificates, prioritizing the issuance to farmers with immovable land. As long as the entire village believes the distribution is appropriate, land certificates should be issued, combining this with party rectification and various other tasks. The third type of village should first eliminate feudal and semi-feudal practices, resolve land issues, then confirm land rights and issue land certificates, and combine this with party rectification and other work throughout the entire land reform process. The instruction pointed out: Starting with the issuance of land certificates to conclude land reform must be connected to the previous stage of work and combined with various tasks. It is not permissible to abandon previous work, suddenly change course, and proceed in isolation. For example, if party rectification is underway to adjust the thinking of party members and cadres, they can be called upon to actively serve the people, enhance their work enthusiasm, absorb activists inside and outside the party, form a leadership core, unify policy understanding, start issuing land certificates, and conduct criticism and self-criticism during the process, gradually improving in all aspects of work and thinking. If there is a lot of floating wealth in the village and the masses demand that it be distributed first, or if it is currently being distributed, the distribution of floating wealth and the issuance of land certificates can be carried out simultaneously. If there are serious violations of middle peasants in the village or if there are omissions of landlords and rich peasants, this can be addressed in conjunction with the land survey and registration during the issuance of land certificates, understanding the land ownership of each household. The instruction particularly emphasized: Rectifying policies or issuing land certificates must be done under the leadership of the Party, after internal and external deliberation. Rely on the poor and hired peasants to unite with the middle peasants, and mobilize the masses to do it.

　　冀中区党委指示各地
  　迅速确定地权颁发土地证
    【冀中电】“结束土改必须于旧历年前完成，目前结束土改的中心内容应抓紧确定地权颁发土地证，从中发动广大群众。解决土改中所遗留下的问题，并结合进行整党与其他工作。”这是中共冀中区党委十二月六日发出的冬季结束土改工作指示的中心。该指示指出：颁发土地证是全部完成土地改革最后一个重要工作，对打下明春大生产的基础有重大意义。有的村从颁发土地证着手进行结束土改，群众很快发动起来；有的村在发土地证的过程中，促进了党员干部的工作热情，提高了对政策的认识，做到了初步整党，缩短了结束土改的时间，并结合处理了土改中遗留下的问题。这都说明发土地证是目前各阶层所迫切需要和关心的事情。指示中根据该区土地抽补分配进行的程度约可分为三类村庄：一是土地抽补分配已经完成，或仅有个别稍需调整的，这类村庄最多，全区（十分区除外）约五千村左右。二是已经没收与征收了地富土地，但尚未分配确定地权，仅暂由农民分组或个别耕种的。三是应进行土改而尚未进行土改或土改尚不彻底村庄。第一类村庄即可从发土地证着手进行结束土改，结合进行整党与各种工作。第二类村子可以分地确定地权与发土地证结合进行，尽先发予不动土地的农户，其他只要全村群众认为分妥，亦即颁发土地证，发土地证中结合进行整党与各种工作。第三类村庄应首先消灭封建半封建解决土地问题，然后确定地权发土地证，并在全部土改过程中结合进行整党与其他工作。指示中指出：从发土地证着手结束土改，必须与前一段工作相衔接，与各种工作相结合，不可把以前工作放开，遽然扭转，孤立进行。如正进行整党调整党员干部思想的，即可号召党员积极为人民服务，提高工作热情，吸收党内外积极分子，组成领导核心，统一政策认识，着手发土地证，并在进行中开展批评与自我批评，从工作上思想上各方面逐步提高。如村中浮财多，群众要求先分浮财或正在分配时，分浮财与发土地证则可同时进行。如村中侵犯中农严重或有遗漏地富，亦可在发土地证进行土地调查登记中，了解各户土地占有情况，结合处理。指示特别强调：端正政策或发土地证，必须在党的领导下，经过党内外酝酿。依靠贫雇农团结中农，发动群众去做。
