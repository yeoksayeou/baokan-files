Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, December 22nd: TASS, Moscow: *Pravda* recently published an article by Marinin on the agreement between Wall Street and the Ruhr tycoons, entitled "The Marshall Plan and West Germany."

Marinin wrote: Anyone who has paid attention to the strategies of Wall Street's "think tank" on the German question has long seen that the United States is pursuing a policy aimed at restoring the power of the Ruhr tycoons. It is precisely for this reason that the American ruling group recently demanded that its Labor Party cronies stop their inflammatory clamor about the "socialization" of the Ruhr. For the same motive, the Anglo-American-French Three-Power Conference in London in June also passed the infamous resolution on the Ruhr issue. According to official communiqués, the London resolution stipulated the establishment of a false "international control" over Ruhr production—coal, coking coal, and steel—but made absolutely no mention of the control of production. This silence is more eloquent than words. But words followed: the "Law 75" was promulgated. This fact thoroughly proves that the new "law" is inextricably linked to the main military-political objectives of the Marshall Plan.

The motto that the American official decision makes the whole gist of the Marshall Plan is that West Germany takes priority over everything else in Western Europe. This means stirring up the revanchist sentiments of the Ruhr tycoons. The economic essence of the Marshall Plan is that the economies of the rest of Western Europe are dependent on the Ruhr basin, that the interests of the Ruhr outweigh the interests of the whole of Western Europe, and that the economies of France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and other Marshallized countries are openly serving the task of reviving the Ruhr basin. Pursuing this goal, the Anglo-American occupation authorities have wrecked the plan for West Germany to deliver reparations, not only halting the dismantling of military enterprises but even beginning to restore enterprises that have already been dismantled. Recently, the Hoffman Administration has reallocated previously approved funds, with the result that loans to West Germany have increased by a quarter, i.e., to $500 million, while loans to other Marshall Plan countries in Western Europe have been reduced accordingly.

As a result of the implementation of "Law 75," American monopoly capital, which now controls the most important economic levers in West Germany, will inevitably become the unbridled master of the Ruhr's war industrial potential, using the Ruhr tycoons as their "errand boys." Based on this, the Marshall Plan implemented in the Anglo-American joint occupation zone stipulates a colonial development system, the scale of which even exceeds the plans applied to other European countries. It is enough to be familiar with the so-called bilateral agreement signed on July 12, 1948, under the Marshall Plan, to believe this fact. The first question that should be asked is, who is participating in this "agreement?" It seems that on the one hand it is the US government, and on the other hand it is the US-British military government in Germany. In other words, the "bilateral agreement" under the Marshall Plan in the joint occupation zone was signed by Clay on one side and the same Clay on the other. He plays two roles, as the representative of the United States and as the "representative of the joint occupation zone," loyal to the policies, plans and goals of American monopoly capital in both respects. The "bilateral agreement" concluded between Clay and Clay gives American monopoly capital, first of all, the material resources of West Germany, and secondly, West Germany's exports, not only existing ones, but also future ones. The "agreement" also opens up unlimited prospects for new American investment in West Germany. Moreover, the private investment of American monopoly capital is also given a "double guarantee" by the US government and the military governors representing the joint occupation zone.

　　真理报评西德现势
    美帝正与鲁尔财阀勾结妄图发展德国战争潜力
    【新华社陕北二十二日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：真理报顷刊载马里宁所作关于华尔街与鲁尔大亨们之间协议的论文，题为“马歇尔计划和西德”。
    马里宁写道：凡是注意华尔街对德问题“智囊团”的谋略的人们，早就看清了美国是在执行一个旨在恢复鲁尔大亨们权力的政策。正因为如此，所以美国统治集团不久以前要求它的工党伙计们停止关于鲁尔“社会化”的煽动性的吵闹。由于同一动机，伦敦美英法三国会议六月间还通过了关于鲁尔问题的臭名昭著的决议。根据官方公报，伦敦决议规定了建立对鲁尔生产——煤、焦煤及钢——的虚伪的“国际管制”，但却完全没有提到管制生产的问题。这一缄默较说话尤为雄辩。但话语随着也就来了：颁布了“第七十五条法律”。这一事实透彻证明，新“法律”不可分离地与马歇尔计划的主要军事政治目标相关联。
    美国官方决定马歇尔计划之整个要旨的格言，就是所谓西德优先于西欧其他一切地方。这意思就是鼓动鲁尔大亨们的复仇主义情绪。马歇尔计划的经济要旨，是西欧其他地方的经济依附于鲁尔盆地，是鲁尔的利益高于整个西欧，是法、比、荷及其他马歇尔化国家的经济公开为复兴鲁尔盆地的任务服务。由于追逐着这种目的之美英占领当局，毁坏了西德交付赔偿的计划，他们不仅停止拆卸军事企业，甚至已开始恢复业经拆卸的企业。最近，霍夫曼总署又重新分配了前已核准的款项，结果，对西德的贷款增加了四分之一，即增至五亿美元，而对西欧其他马歇尔计划国家的贷款则相应减少了。
    由于实施“第七十五条法律”的结果，现在已经操纵西德最重要经济杠杆的美国独占资本，将必然成为鲁尔战争工业潜力之丝毫不受约束的主人，而利用鲁尔大亨们作为他们的“小伙计”。根据这一点，在美英联合占领区实行的马歇尔计划，规定了一个殖民地的开发体制，其规模甚至超过施于其他欧洲国家的计划。只要熟悉一九四八年七月十二日根据马歇尔计划签订的所谓双边协定，就足以相信这一事实。首先应当问的是，参加这个“协定”的是谁。看起来好象一方面是美国政府，另一方面则是德境美英军政府。换句话说，对联合占领区的马歇尔计划下的“双边协定”，其签订者一方是克莱，另一方是同一个克莱。他一身二任，是美国代表又是“联合占领区代表”，在两方面都忠于美国垄断资本的政策、计划和目的。克莱与克莱之间所订的“双边协定”，交给美国垄断资本的，首先是西德的物质资源，其次是西德的输出还不仅是现有的，而且，包括将来的。“协定”又为美国在西德的新投资开辟了无限的前途。并且，美国垄断资本的私人投资，还得到美国政府方面以及代表联合占领区的军事总督们方面的“双重保证”。
