To increase agricultural production by even a small amount next year, and to lay the most effective material foundation, a winter manure accumulation campaign is underway in most areas here. According to incomplete statistics from more than fifty villages in five counties including Zuoquan, Shexian, and Licheng, over a million dan of manure have already been accumulated. In Dongziyan Village, Zuoquan, thanks to the joint efforts of men and women, over ten thousand dan of manure have been accumulated since the end of the autumn harvest. Women alone have accumulated more than seventeen hundred dan. The village has a total of 1,009.3 mu of autumn-harvested land, and there is already an average of more than 60 dan of manure per mu for next year. The work is continuing, with the goal of ensuring an average of 100 dan of fertilizer per mu next year. The masses say, "As long as enough fertilizer is applied, it will grow whether it wants to or not." Qianchier Village in Shexian has also accumulated more than 19,000 dan of manure. The village has a total of 310 mu of autumn-harvested land, with an average of 60 dan of manure per mu already available. Women in Mogou Village, Zuoquan, accumulated 500 dan of manure in five days. The methods of accumulating manure mainly include dozens of ways such as composting rice stalks, weeds, pressing sesame cakes, diligently lining cattle and sheep pens, and collecting manure by sweeping streets and courtyards. In short, manure is everywhere, waiting only for diligent people. The development of this movement is primarily due to the fact that leaders at all levels have placed manure accumulation in an important position when deploying winter production work. In summarizing this autumn's wheat planting, the Fifth Special District Commissioner's Office felt that fertilizer was extremely lacking, and half of the wheat fields in the entire special district were not fertilized. In the Second and Third Special Districts, where more fertilizer was applied, some land was still sown without fertilizer. This situation greatly surprised leaders at all levels, who deeply felt that if manure is not accumulated in large quantities this winter, increased production next year will inevitably fail. The Huguan County Committee, in addition to specific arrangements, also put forward a resounding slogan: "If you get to work, there will be fertilizer. If the manure pile is big this winter, the grain pile will be big next year!" After the manure accumulation plan was communicated to the villages, it was combined with a summary of the year's production to educate the masses with facts, helping them understand that "planting land without fertilizer is just a confused mess." This led to the unfolding of the manure accumulation movement. A major feature of village-level leadership is the accurate calculation of the amount of land and the amount of fertilizer, carrying out manure accumulation in a planned and targeted manner to avoid failure. Wangjinzhuang Village in Shexian calculated that the village has a total of more than 3,900 mu of land, requiring more than 270,000 dan of manure at 70 dan per mu. Currently, there are only more than 137,700 dan of fertilizer, leaving a shortage of more than 132,000 dan. After everyone understood the situation, they worked together to make up for the shortfall. However, from the perspective of the entire Taihang region, the manure accumulation movement is not yet widespread and needs strong promotion.

### 准备明年多打粮食　太行各地大量积肥

　　准备明年多打粮食
    太行各地大量积肥
    【太行电】为明年农业生产提高一寸，打下最有效的物质基础，此间大部地区正开展冬季积肥运动。根据左权、涉县、黎城等五县共五十余村的不完全统计，已积肥百万余担。左权洞子岩村，由于男女齐动手，自结束秋收至今，已积肥万余担。其中只妇女即积肥一千七百余担。全村共秋地一千零九亩三分，明年每亩已有肥六十余担。现仍继续进行，要保证明年每亩地平均上肥一百担。群众说：“只要上足肥，不长也不由它。”涉县前池耳村亦积肥一万九千余担。该村共秋地三百一十亩，每亩已有肥六十担。左权磨沟村妇女，在五天内积肥五百担。在积肥的方法上，大部是薰沤禾杆、杂草、榨麻饼及勤垫牛羊圈、拾粪扫街院等数十种。总之，粪土到处有，只等勤劳人。此一运动的开展，首先是各级领导在布置冬产工作中，均将积肥提到重要的位置。五专署在总结今秋种麦中，感到肥料异常缺乏，全专区有一半麦地未上肥，上肥较多的二三专区，亦有少部土地是白种。这种情况，使各级领导者大吃一惊。深感如今冬不大量积肥，明年增产将势必落空。壶关县委会，除具体布置，并提出了响亮的口号：“一动手，肥就有，今冬肥堆大，明年粮堆大。”积肥布置到村后，结合总结一年生产，以事实教育群众，了解了“种地不上肥，尽是糊瞎混。”展开了积肥运动。村级领导的一个主要特点，就是精确算土地数与肥料数，有计划有目标的进行积肥，以免落空。涉县王金庄计算了一下全村共有土地三千九百余亩，每亩以七十担计，共需二十七万余担，到现在只有肥十三万七千七百余担，还缺十三万二千余担。大家摸底后，一致努力，要补足缺短数。但从太行全区来看，积肥运动尚不普遍，极需大力推动。
