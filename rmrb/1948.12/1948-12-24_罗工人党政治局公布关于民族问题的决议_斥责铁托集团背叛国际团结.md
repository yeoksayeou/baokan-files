　　Telecommunications Agency, Bucharest: The Politburo of the Romanian Workers' Party has recently published a resolution on the nationalities issue. The resolution first criticizes Tito for betraying international solidarity, persecuting various ethnic groups within Yugoslavia, and submitting to capitalist countries, thereby endangering the very survival of the Yugoslav Republic. The resolution points out that only through the united struggle of the working people of all nationalities within each new democratic country, through mutual assistance between countries, and by uniting around the Soviet Union, is it possible to build socialism and maintain independence.

　　The resolution points out that Romania has achieved great success on the nationalities issue, but the problem has not been completely resolved. The resolution emphasizes that the goal of Romanian communists is to complete national equality and to fight against chauvinism of the Romanian minority. The resolution then reviews the influence of nationalism on various ethnic groups within Romania and sharply condemns the agents of the United States and the Vatican for supporting the reactionaries among Hungarians, Jews, and Germans within Romania, issuing slogans such as "democratic unity." The purpose of these slogans is to replace class struggle with class cooperation within each ethnic group, to create division among the working class, and to revive bourgeois nationalism. The resolution calls for struggle against the nationalist remnants in the Hungarian People's Alliance within Romania, condemns Zionists, demands the reorganization of the Jewish Democratic Committee, and calls for the establishment of a German Anti-Fascist Committee to eradicate the ideological habits learned by Germans from German imperialists. The resolution also discusses the national issues of Russians, Ukrainians, Bulgarians, Serbs, Greeks, Albanians, and Jews within Romania.

　　Note: The countries of Eastern Europe, especially the Balkan Peninsula countries, are multi-ethnic states. In the past, imperialist countries and the ruling classes of these countries, in order to facilitate their aggression and rule, consistently used these multi-ethnic historical conditions, spread nationalism, oppressed ethnic minorities, and provoked mutual relations among the people of various ethnic groups, making the nationalities issue more complex. In August 1944, although Romania had turned its guns against the German invaders, the three successive reactionary governments still adopted a policy of persecution against ethnic minorities within Romania. General Radescu, the prime minister of the third government, which had close ties with the US-British bloc, even organized atrocities in the Outer Transylvania region that devastated Hungarian residents. In March 1945, the National Democratic Front, led by the Communist Party, began to govern, and the new government began to implement a policy of national equality. The Hungarian People's Union, a democratic group of Hungarians in Outer Transylvania, had twenty-nine representatives participating in the National Assembly. This laid the foundation for eliminating the long-standing hostility between Romanians and Hungarians in the region. At the same time, the new government also openly denounced the imperialist act of the Romanian reactionary government in 1913 when it occupied Southern Dobruja, a Bulgarian territory, thus eliminating all disputes between Romania and Bulgaria.

　　罗工人党政治局公布关于民族问题的决议
    斥责铁托集团背叛国际团结
    【新华社陕北二十二日电】电通社布加勒斯特讯：罗马尼亚工人党政治局顷发表关于民族问题的决议。决议首先斥责铁托背叛国际团结，迫害南斯拉夫境内的各族人民，屈从资本主义国家，因而已危及南斯拉夫共和国本身的生存。决议指出：各新民主主义国家，只有经过国内劳动人民不分民族的统一斗争，经过各国间的互助并团结在苏联的周围，才有可能建设社会主义和保持独立。
    决议指出罗马尼亚在民族问题上已赢得伟大的成就，但问题并未完全解决。决议强调指出：罗马尼亚共产主义者的目的，是必须完成民族平等，并与罗马尼亚少数人的沙文主义作斗争。决议继即检讨民族主义对罗马尼亚境内各民族的影响，并尖锐谴责美国及梵蒂岗的代理人支持罗国境内的匈牙利人、犹太人及德人中的反动派，发出所谓“民主统一”等口号。这些口号的目的，是要以各民族内部的阶级合作来代替阶级斗争，企业造成工人阶级的分裂及资产阶级民族主义的复活。决议号召与罗国境内的匈牙利人民联盟中的民族主义残余作斗争。谴责犹太复国主义者，要求改组犹太民主委员会，并号召成立德人反法西斯委员会，以根除德人中从德帝国主义者学来的思想习惯。决议也论及罗马尼亚境内的俄罗斯、乌克兰、保加利亚、塞尔维亚、希腊、阿尔巴尼亚与犹太等民族问题。
    按：东欧各国，特别是巴尔干半岛各国都是多民族的国家。过去，各帝国主义国家及各该国的统治阶级，为便利其侵略及统治，一贯利用这种多民族的历史条件，散布民族主义，压迫少数民族，挑拨各族人民相互间的关系，使民族问题复杂化。一九四四年八月间，罗马尼亚虽已掉转枪口反对德寇，但接连三届的反动政府，对罗国境内的少数民族都仍然采取迫害政策。与美英集团有密切联系的第三届政府的总理拉吉斯科将军，且曾在外西尔瓦尼亚区组织了蹂躏匈牙利居民的暴行。一九四五年三月间，以共产党为首的民族民主阵线开始执政，新政府即开始实行民族平等的政策。外西尔瓦尼亚区匈牙利人的民主集团——匈牙利人民联合会，即有二十九个代表参加国会。这样就奠下了消除这一地区内罗马尼亚人和匈牙利人历来仇视的条件。同时，新政府也公开指斥了一九一三年罗国反动政府侵占保加利亚领土南多不鲁查的帝国主义行为，因而也消除了罗保两国间的一切争论问题。
