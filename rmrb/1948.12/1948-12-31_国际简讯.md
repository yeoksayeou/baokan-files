    △The New York State Industrial Union Council of the CIO in the United States recently held a meeting in Syracuse, attended by 800 representatives, including 200 progressives.

    △Italy and Hungary signed a trade agreement stipulating that the total value of goods exchanged in 1949 would be approximately 35 million US dollars. Hungary will supply Italy with food, tallow, and a large amount of raw materials, while Italy will export agricultural products and manufactured goods to Hungary.
    △As a result of the Marshall Plan, the production level of daily necessities in Austria is now only 60 to 68 percent of the 1937 level, and some sectors are even only 50 percent. Agricultural production, which could meet 80 percent of the country's needs before the war, can now only meet one-third.
