　　To Comrade Liang Yu Gong from the Fourth District of Dingxiang:
    It is natural for the child's uncle to want to take the child home for a visit. The married mother should not be too obstructive. If there is concern that the child may not be returned, both families or the district/village government can provide a guarantee to ensure the child is returned on the agreed-upon date. As for the issue of the child's lineage, it should be handled according to the endorsement on the marriage certificate; whether it is three or ten years depends on the marriage certificate.

    An Xinmin, Judicial Section, Weixian County:
    Regarding the division of responsibilities between public security and the judiciary, the North China Government's Ministry of Justice has drafted a circular, which will be issued by the North China People's Government soon. We will not repeat it here.

    (North China Government Ministry of Justice)

    Dr. Ding Tiecheng, Zhengding: Regarding the issue of your sheep being wrongly confiscated by the Zhujia Beikou Village in Lingshou and the delay in resolving it, we have requested the Lingshou County Party Committee to resolve it reasonably as soon as possible, based on the actual situation.

    Comrade Song Sanchao, Luanshan Street, Cixian County:
    Regarding the issue of your iron shop being wrongly confiscated and the compensation being too small to make a living, we have requested the Cixian County Party Committee to resolve it appropriately.

    Comrade Yang Shou×, Chun He Tang, Yuanshi: Regarding the withdrawal from marriage involving Chun He Tang in Luancheng and Mei Hua Town, Gaocheng, we have separately requested the Luancheng and Gaocheng County Committees to investigate and handle the matter.

    Comrade Hu Ke, Yongnian: Regarding your letter requesting compensation for your wrongly confiscated clothing, we have requested the Yongnian Chengguan District Office to handle it appropriately based on the actual situation.

　　信箱定襄四区梁玉公君：
    小孩的叔父要求把小孩领回家来看一趟，这也是人情之常，已出嫁的母亲不应过分留难。如果怕小孩一去不回，可由双方亲族或区村政府作保证依约定的日期，把小孩送回。至于小孩归宗问题，应依据婚书上批语办理；是三年或十年，可看结婚书决定。魏县司法科安新民：
    关于公安与司法的权责，华北政府司法部已拟定通令，不日可由华北人民政府颁发，此处不再重复。
