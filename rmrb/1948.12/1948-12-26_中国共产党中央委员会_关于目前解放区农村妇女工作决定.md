Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 24th: The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China recently issued the "Decision on Current Rural Women's Work in Liberated Areas." This decision was made based on the suggestions of the Women's Work Conference held from September 20th to October 6th this year. Eighty-five women's work cadres from North China, Shandong, Jin-Sui, and Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia liberated areas attended this year's September Women's Work Conference. Comrades Liu Shaoqi, Zhu De, Zhou Enlai, Chen Boda, and others attended and spoke. Comrade Deng Yingchao, acting secretary of the Women's Movement Committee of the CPC Central Committee, gave a report at the meeting on several major issues concerning rural women's work in liberated areas. Comrades Yang Zhihua, Li Peizhi, and Luo Qiong, members of the Women's Committee of the CPC Central Committee, made special speeches on women's marriage, cadres, and production issues. Representatives from various regions, based on the central instructions and conference reports, as well as the actual conditions of women and the experience of women's work in their respective areas, engaged in heated discussions. After the meeting, the Women's Committee of the CPC Central Committee wrote a written proposal on current rural women's work in liberated areas, which was submitted to the CPC Central Committee as the basis for making the current decision. The full text of the decision is as follows:

Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Current Rural Women's Work in Liberated Areas

Based on the suggestions of the Women's Work Conference convened by the Central Committee in September 1948, the following decisions are made regarding current rural women's work in liberated areas:

(1) The Chinese people persisted in the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan and defeated Japanese imperialism; now, after two and a half years of the People's Liberation War, unprecedented and great victories have been achieved. In another year or so, it will be possible to fundamentally overthrow the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang. The attainment of this victory relies on the correct leadership of the Party, the heroic and skillful fighting of the People's Liberation Army, and the arduous struggle of the broad masses of the people; and women, who account for half of the population, have also played a significant role, becoming an indispensable force in defeating the enemy and building a new China. Women's work has been successful. In particular, since the Central Committee issued the "Decision on the Current Guidelines for Women's Work in Anti-Japanese Base Areas" in February 1943, women's work in liberated areas has been guided by a clear direction. In places where this guideline has been implemented, women's work has undergone a significant transformation, further mobilizing and organizing the broad masses of rural women in liberated areas to participate in handicrafts, sideline occupations, and agricultural production, and vigorously support the war. In the land reform movement, various liberated areas mobilized even broader masses of women to actively participate in the struggle to equally distribute land and eliminate feudalism. In areas where land reform has been completed, fundamental changes have taken place in rural class relations, with men and women, old and young, equally sharing a portion of land; many women have become district and village representatives, even being elected as village chiefs, deputy village chiefs, or cadres above the village level; the level of awareness and enthusiasm of women has greatly increased; their status in politics, economy, family, and society has also undergone fundamental changes. This has opened up the path to the complete liberation of women.

However, there are also some shortcomings in women's work in liberated areas. In some areas, Party organizations and women's organizations did not fully understand the decision issued by the Central Committee in February 1943, and did not fully understand that organizing women to actively participate in production is the central task of women's work, as well as the central key to protecting women's special interests and striving for women's liberation from the shackles of feudal remnants; some places even completely ignored this decision; therefore, it was not conscientiously implemented and executed. Secondly, in some areas, in the process of mobilizing women to participate in production, land reform, and support the front lines, they failed to consciously pay attention to removing some of the feudal shackles remaining on women, in order to satisfy women's special interests and requirements, believing that mobilizing women to participate in production and land reform would naturally solve everything; or they mechanically separated general work from women's work, so that some of the special sufferings of women were not resolved in a timely manner, hindering the full mobilization of women. Some areas still have some old, isolated, and prominent errors in carrying out women's liberation work, creating opposition within male and female peasants and young and old women, thus becoming detached from the masses. The latter has been largely corrected since 1943, and only a few areas have not yet fully overcome it, and are now being corrected; while the former is still a relatively common phenomenon in various places. The main reason for these shortcomings is that some cadres in Party and women's organizations in some areas lack a complete mass work perspective, do not fully recognize the importance of women's work, do not deeply understand that women's work is a part of the entire revolutionary work, and fail to appropriately combine mobilizing women to actively produce with protecting women's special interests.

In addition, some Party organizations and women's organizations have not paid enough attention to the glorious tasks of leading women to support the war and consolidate the troops. They either have not seriously carried out the work of helping and giving preferential treatment to the families of soldiers; or they have not conducted appropriate criticism and education on the "dragging tail" behavior and other behaviors that hinder the consolidation of the troops by some backward military dependents. They have not made women understand that without the victory of the People's Liberation War, there would be no true liberation of women, and therefore cannot fully inspire women's enthusiasm for supporting the war.

Because work was not checked in a timely manner, experiences were not summarized, and deviations were not corrected, the above-mentioned shortcomings could not be overcome in a timely manner.

(2) The current guideline for rural women's work in liberated areas should still regard mobilizing and organizing the broad masses of women to actively participate in production as the basic link of women's work. The basic guideline for women's work proposed in the Central Committee's February 1943 decision is still fully applicable. It is necessary to make the entire Party and all cadres doing women's work, as well as activists among the women, understand that: Under the new democratic regime, all laws of the old society that bound and abused women and placed them in a position of obedience or humiliation no longer exist; new laws guaranteeing complete equality of men and women in economic, political, and social status have already been formulated or basically formulated in the early stages of the establishment of the new democratic regime; the question is how to make these laws be thoroughly implemented. Due to the old society's legacy of the concept of favoring men over women, and the shackles of various feudal customs, especially the weakness of women left over from the old society who had to rely on men economically, were not good at engaging in various kinds of labor, and even despised labor, hindering women from quickly realizing the rights already stipulated in law. Therefore, in order to thoroughly implement women's rights, it is still necessary to carry out necessary work. First of all, it is necessary to enable women not only to obtain equal economic rights and status as men, and to obtain and retain the same share of land and property in rural areas, but especially to make women fully recognize the importance of labor, regard labor as a glorious cause, and actively participate in various labor production work that they are physically capable of, and become creators of wealth in the family and society. Only when women actively engage in labor, gradually achieve economic independence and do not rely on others, will they be respected by their parents-in-law, husbands, and society, will they increase family harmony and unity, will they more easily improve and consolidate the status of women in society and politics, and will the various laws of equality between men and women have a strong foundation for full implementation. The experience of the past few years has also fully proven this point. That is to say, in places where women actively participate in labor production, regard labor as glorious, conduct education on equality between men and women, oppose feudal bondage, and have been allocated land, the status of women appears to be completely different from the past. They are in a very happy mood, respected by people, and many activists are elected as representatives or participate in other social and political activities. Moreover, it must be recognized that women's participation in labor is not only the basic key to women's liberation; whether for today's support of the war, for the new democratic economic construction, or for the future victory of socialism, women's labor is extremely needed and indispensable.

Therefore, in the rural areas of the liberated areas, we must continue to mobilize and organize the broad masses of women to participate in agriculture, handicrafts, and sideline production with all our efforts. As for the specific guidelines and requirements for restoring and developing various productions, and what kind of production should women in various places focus on participating in (agriculture, handicrafts, sideline occupations), specific plans should be formulated according to the unified production plans of the local Party and government, the situation of male and female labor forces, and the original production habits of women, adapting to the time and place.

In order to stabilize and increase women's enthusiasm for participating in production, various places must, in ending the land reform work, solve various issues related to women based on the local Party's correct policy and the guidelines for handling land reform legacy issues. The government must issue a clear order to protect women's land rights. When issuing land certificates on a household basis, the land certificate must indicate that men and women have equal land rights, and all family members have the right to democratically dispose of property. If necessary, a separate land certificate can also be issued to women. At the same time, long-term propaganda and explanation work should be carried out among all peasants, so that male and female peasants can fully recognize the importance of protecting women's land rights.

In order to make the production of rural women develop healthily, it is necessary to correctly implement the policy of "organizing," vigorously mobilize women to participate in various cooperatives (such as agricultural mutual aid groups, textile groups, and other production cooperatives, and supply and marketing cooperatives, etc.). In terms of agricultural production, it is advisable for women to participate in household-to-household cooperation and small mutual aid groups in which both men and women can participate. In terms of handicrafts and sideline occupations, it is advisable for women to participate in various supply and marketing cooperatives. In terms of methods, the principles of voluntariness and mutual benefit must be implemented, democratic spirit must be brought into play, the creativity of the masses must be encouraged, excessive interference, forced commands, and formalism must be avoided, and at the same time, it must not fall into laissez-faire.

With production as the center, and in the process of production, strengthen the education of women, improve women's political awareness and cultural level, mobilize women to participate in democratic governance, promote maternal and child health (such as holding training classes for maternal and child health cadres, organizing cooperative associations of Chinese and Western medicine, etc.), and protect the special interests of women. The feudal ideas, traditions, and customs that hinder women's participation in political, economic, and cultural activities (first of all, participation in production) must be consciously and step by step eliminated. It should not be assumed that as long as women participate in production, some of the feudal shackles on women that remain in society will be eliminated naturally, and there is no need to carry out any more work. This laissez-faireism, the view that does not pay attention to the special interests of women, is also wrong. In the process of production, the idea of equality between men and women should be regularly educated to all peasants through various mass organizations and meetings, feudal ideas and traditional customs should be criticized, and it should be pointed out that all feudal customs that bind women must be abolished. It is still necessary to appropriately struggle against a small number of backward elements who want to maintain old feudal customs and often oppress women when necessary. However, it must be understood that this struggle belongs to the ideological struggle within the peasants, and should be strictly distinguished from the class struggle against feudal landlords. Moreover, the purpose of this struggle is to more effectively educate all peasants, to better mobilize women to participate in production and other construction undertakings, to establish truly democratic and harmonious families, and to further consolidate and strengthen the unity within the peasants. At the same time, it must also be recognized that this is the work of transforming the thinking of the peasants, a process of long-term efforts, and cannot be rushed. We should oppose laissez-faire, and we should also oppose acute illness. For foot-binding, drowning infants, arranged marriages, and child brides, the government should issue orders to prohibit them, and at the same time educate the masses, and strive to implement them. In liberated areas, some of the marriage laws in the past violated the principles of equality between men and women and freedom of marriage, and should be quickly revised.

In the new liberated areas, the guideline for rural women's work should be based on the Central Committee's instructions on work in new areas, publicize the Party's policies (including women's work policies), expand the Party's influence, expose all the enemy's rumors and slanders, stabilize social order, and in areas where rent reduction and interest reduction are carried out or land reform is implemented, mobilize the broad masses of women to actively participate, and lead and organize women to participate in production and construction, and support the war. In those new areas, after implementing rent reduction and interest reduction or obtaining land, labor production is also the central link of women's work. As for the feudal traditional customs that bind women, they are bound to be very serious in the new areas, therefore it is necessary to carry out education on equality between men and women among the broad masses, enlighten the consciousness of the masses, and gradually break them down consciously and step by step according to the degree of their consciousness.

(3) Regarding the organizational forms of women's masses, in the past, some areas have abolished the separate organizations of women's masses, or they exist in name only, which is inappropriate. According to the current specific situation of Chinese women, there must still be separate women's mass organizations in order to lead and promote women's work, unite and educate the broad masses of women, and regularly serve women.

The women's representative conference is the best organizational form to more broadly and democratically connect with the women's masses, and all levels in various places should have this kind of organization. The village-level women's representative conference is the grassroots organization of this representative conference. The generation of its representatives should be democratically elected by the women's masses, and must include female representatives of the People's Congress, representatives of women's organizations (such as female representatives of textile groups, cooperatives, literacy classes, etc.), and representatives directly elected by the broad masses of women (can be elected by a certain number of women according to living conditions). The role of this representative conference is to represent the opinions of the women's masses, discuss the guidelines and tasks of local women's work and important work, convey the policies, laws, or resolutions of the democratic government and higher-level organizations, and mobilize the broad masses of women to jointly implement them. At the same time, a committee should be elected by the representative conference to implement the resolutions, preside over daily work, and convene representative conferences regularly. The name of this committee can be determined according to the opinions of the masses. In places where the masses are already familiar with the Women's Federation, it can be called the committee of the Women's Federation. Also, in order to enrich the organized mass base, the committee of the women's representative conference should use various organizational forms, such as literacy classes, cooperatives, mutual aid groups, etc., to organize women with various demands; at the same time, it must also regularly contact and serve the broad masses of unorganized women.

Above the county level, women's representative conferences should also be convened according to the above principles to elect committees of the Women's Federation to lead women's work.

In the past, the Women's Federation in a few areas did not proceed from the actual situation of the masses, formalistically emphasized the development of members in the organization, held too many group meetings formalistically, did not convene representative conferences for a long time; in terms of work, it forced and commanded, formalistically completed the so-called tasks of the higher level, instead of serving the masses; thus, the Women's Federation was substantially detached from the masses and became an agency monopolized by a few people. This bad phenomenon should be corrected in the future.

In the newly liberated rural areas, when the situation is initially stable, women's organizations can be established. However, preparatory work must be carried out step by step and with a plan beforehand, and women's organizations should be gradually established according to the needs and awareness of the masses, to unite and educate the broad masses of women. This women's organization must be based on working women.

(4) According to the needs of the current revolutionary situation, it is necessary to boldly cultivate, boldly use, and promote a large number of Party and non-Party female cadres to various work positions, and strengthen the cadres of women's organizations at all levels. Male and female cadres with equal abilities should be assigned equal work and given equal opportunities for training and education, and should not be discriminated against; and according to the special circumstances of female cadres, more attention should be paid to improving their political, theoretical, cultural level, and work ability, helping them solve special difficulties, and running nurseries, kindergartens, or organizing female cadres to exchange labor and help each other take care of children, in order to alleviate the difficulties of female cadres, and can also be used as a starting point for developing social childcare undertakings. New rural labor women cadres, in particular, must be strengthened in education, patiently cultivated, and gradually promoted in their original work positions, and attention should be paid to developing female Party members. In the new areas, special attention should be paid to training local female cadres. Party schools and training classes sponsored by the government at all levels should plan to absorb female cadres to study, and the organizational departments and propaganda departments of the Party at all levels should include the training and education of female cadres in their business. Female cadres themselves, under the leadership and education of the Party, should consciously work actively, be proficient in business, strengthen unity, improve work efficiency, strive to learn the knowledge of theory, policy, culture, production business knowledge and skills, carry out criticism and self-criticism, overcome the weaknesses of women, strive for progress, and strengthen the idea of serving the people. This is the basic condition for improving yourself and becoming an excellent cadre of the Party.

(5) Since the National Land Conference in 1947, the Party committees at all levels have generally paid more attention to the leadership of women's work than before, and there have been some improvements, but they have not been able to regularly and systematically implement the leadership of women's work, and women's work has shown a passive phenomenon of being tight when the above is tight and loose when the above is loose. There are still a few Party committees that have not overcome the laissez-faire phenomenon of neglecting women's work. In the future, the entire Party must fully recognize that mobilizing the broad masses of women to participate in the revolutionary struggle is an indispensable force for winning the national revolutionary victory, and further strengthen the leadership of women's work, and implement the Party's policy of doing women's work throughout the Party. Party committees at all levels should include women's work as a part of the Party's entire work, and when arranging, checking, and summarizing various work, women's work should be included. Party newspapers and news agencies at all levels above the county level should strengthen propaganda reports on women's work. Party committees at all levels above the county level should establish and improve women's committee organizations, and regularly give them guidance and help. Below the district level, the branch should lead women's work, and a dedicated person should be designated to be responsible. The responsibilities of women at all levels are to study women's issues and women's policies under the leadership of the Party committee at the same level, check women's work, and make suggestions to the Party committee to guide and promote women's work.

The Party should further correct the feudal ideas of favoring men over women that remain inside and outside the Party, and the idea of excluding women's work from the entire work, as well as the deviation of doing women's work in an isolated and prominent manner. Party organizations at all levels should strengthen the study and application of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought to guide women's work, cultivate a complete mass viewpoint, correctly grasp the policies of the women's movement, and overcome the phenomena of indiscipline and anarchy in women's work. Women workers should be more realistic, go deep into the masses, work hard, serve the women wholeheartedly, and push the women's movement further forward.

(6) In order to adapt to the needs of the national revolutionary development, concentrate the combat power of women, women's organizations in the liberated areas should strive to unite all women in the country who oppose American imperialism, oppose feudalism, and oppose bureaucratic capitalism, and jointly fight to drive American imperialism out of China, overthrow the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, and establish a unified new democratic people's republic. To this end, it is decided that women's organizations in the liberated areas should initiate the convening of a national women's representative conference in the spring of 1949 to establish the National Democratic Women's Federation, so that the national women's movement can develop forward on a larger and more powerful scale under the unified policy leadership.

　　中国共产党中央委员会
  　关于目前解放区农村妇女工作决定
    【新华社陕北二十四日电】中国共产党中央委员会顷发表“关于目前解放区农村妇女工作的决定”。这个决定是根据今年九月二十日至十月六日召开的妇女工作会议的建议而作出的。出席今年九月妇女工作会议的有华北、山东、晋绥、陕甘宁各解放区妇女工作干部八十五人。刘少奇、朱德、周恩来、陈伯达等同志曾出席讲话。中共中央妇女运动委员会代书记邓颖超同志在会议上作了关于解放区农村妇女工作的几个主要问题的报告。中共中央妇委委员杨之华、李培之、罗琼等三同志关于妇女的婚姻、干部、生产等问题作了专题发言。各地代表根据中央指示和大会报告，以及各地妇女群众的实际情况和妇女工作经验，展开了热烈的讨论。会后由中共中央妇委写成了对于目前解放区农村妇女工作的书面建议，提交中共中央据以作出现在的决定。决定全文如下：
    中国共产党中央委员会关于目前解放区农村妇女工作的决定
    根据一九四八年九月中央召开的妇女工作会议的建议，对于目前解放区的农村妇女工作，特作如下决定：
    （一）中国人民坚持了八年的抗日战争，战胜了日本帝国主义；现在又进行了两年半的人民解放战争，获得了空前伟大的胜利，再有一年左右时间，便可能在根本上打倒国民党反动统治。这种胜利的获得，是依靠着党的正确领导，人民解放军的英勇善战，与广大人民的艰苦奋斗；而占人口半数的妇女，也起了很大的作用，成为战胜敌人，建设新中国的一种不可缺少的力量。妇女工作是有成绩的。特别是从一九四三年二月中央发布了“关于各抗日根据地目前妇女工作方针的决定”以后，解放区的妇女工作，获得了明确方针的指导。在执行了这一方针的地方，妇女工作有了显著的转变，进一步动员和组织了解放区广大农村妇女，参加了手工业，副业和农业生产，大力支援了战争。在土地改革运动中，各解放区发动了更为广大的妇女群众，积极参加了平分土地，消灭封建的斗争。在土地改革完成了的地区，农村阶级关系起了根本变化，男女老少同样分得了一份土地；有不少的妇女当了区村代表，以至于当选为村长副村长或村以上的干部；妇女们的觉悟程度和积极性，大大提高了一步；她们在政治上、经济上、家庭中和社会上的地位，亦随着有了根本的改变。这就开辟了妇女完全解放的道路。
    可是解放区的妇女工作，也存在着若干缺点。有一些地区党的组织和妇女团体，对一九四三年二月中央发布的决定认识不足，没有全面地了解：组织妇女积极参加生产，是妇女工作的中心任务，也是保护妇女特殊利益，争取妇女从封建残余的束缚之下解放出来的中心关键；有一些地方甚至完全忽视了这一决定；因而没有认真地贯彻和执行。其次，是有些地区，在发动妇女参加生产、土地改革和支援前线的工作过程中，未能有意识地注意解除存留着的一些对妇女的封建束缚，以满足妇女的特殊利益和要求，认为发动妇女参加生产和土地改革，就一切都自然会随着解决了；或者是机械地把一般工作与妇女工作割裂开来，以致妇女群众的某些特殊痛苦，未能及时解除，阻碍了妇女群众的充分发动。有些地区还存在有若干旧的孤立突出地去进行妇女解放工作的错误偏向，造成了男女农民及青年老年妇女内部的对立，以致脱离了群众。后者从一九四三年以后，已大体纠正，只有少数地区尚未完全克服，现在也正在纠正之中；而前者则直到现在还是各地比较普遍存在的现象。产生这些缺点的主要原因，是由于有些地区党和妇女组织中的部分干部，缺乏完整的群众工作观点，没有全面地认识妇女工作的重要性，不够深刻地了解妇女工作是整个革命工作的一部分，未能适当地把发动妇女积极生产与保护妇女特殊利益相结合。
    此外，有些地区党的组织和妇女团体对于领导妇女群众支援战争与巩固部队的光荣任务，注意不够。他们或者对于帮助与优待军人家属的工作，没有认真进行；或者对于一部分落后军属“拖尾巴”及其他各种妨碍部队巩固的行为，不进行适当的批评和教育。他们没有使妇女群众了解：如果没有人民解放战争的胜利，就没有妇女群众的真正解放，因而就不能充分启发妇女群众支援战争的热情。
    由于没有及时地检查工作，总结经验，纠正偏向，以致上述这些缺点未能及时克服。
    （二）目前解放区农村妇女工作的方针，仍应以动员和组织广大妇女群众积极参加生产视为妇女工作的基本环节。中央一九四三年二月决定中所提出的妇女工作基本方针，仍然是完全适用的。必须使全党和一切做妇女工作的干部，以及妇女群众中的积极分子懂得：在新民主政权之下，过去旧社会一切束缚虐待妇女，使妇女处于服从或屈辱地位的法律，都已不复存在了；新的保障男女在经济上、政治上、社会上的地位完全平等的法律，在新民主政权建立的最初时期，就已经制订或是基本上已经制订了；问题是如何使这些法律能够贯彻地实现。由于旧社会遗留下来的重男轻女观念，和各样封建习俗的束缚，特别是旧社会遗留下来的妇女在经济上要依靠男子，不善于从事各种劳动，甚至鄙视劳动的弱点，妨碍了妇女迅速实现法律上所已规定了的权利。因此，要贯彻实现妇女的权利，还必须进行必要的工作。首先是必须使妇女不仅与男子一样获得平等的经济权利与地位，在农村获得并保有同样的一份土地和财产，而尤其必须使妇女充分认识劳动的重要，把劳动看成是光荣的事业，而积极地去参加在体力上可以胜任的各种劳动生产工作，成为家庭和社会上财富的创造者。只有妇女积极起来劳动，逐渐做到在经济上能够独立并不依靠别人，才会被公婆丈夫和社会上所敬重，才会更增加家庭的和睦与团结，才会更容易提高和巩固妇女们在社会上和政治上的地位，也才会使男女平等的各项法律有充分实现的强固基础。过去几年的经验也完全证明了这一点。即是说，凡是妇女积极参加了劳动生产，视劳动为光荣，进行过男女平等的教育，反对过封建束缚，又分得了土地的地方，妇女们的地位显得与过去是完全不相同。她们的心情很愉快，受人们尊敬，不少的积极分子被推选为代表或参加其他社会政治活动。而且必须认识：妇女参加劳动，不仅是妇女解放的基本关键；无论为着今天的支援战争，为着新民主主义的经济建设，以及为着将来社会主义的胜利，妇女劳动都是极端需要而不能缺少的。
    因此，我们在解放区农村中，要用一切努力，继续去动员和组织广大妇女群众参加农业、手工业及副业生产。至于恢复和发展各种生产的具体方针和要求以及各地的妇女应以参加何种生产为主（农业、手工业、副业），应根据当地党政统一的生产计划，男女劳动力的情况及妇女原有的生产习惯，因时因地而制定具体的方案。
    为了安定和提高妇女参加生产的热情，各地在结束土改工作中，必须根据当地党端正政策，处理土改遗留问题的方针，解决有关妇女的各项问题。要由政府明令保障妇女的土地权。在以家庭为单位发土地证件时，须在土地证上注明男女均有同等的土地权，全家成员有民主处理财产之权，必要时，还可单独另发土地证给妇女。同时又应在全体农民中，进行长期的宣传解释工作，使男女农民能全面地认识保障妇女土地权的重要性。
    为了使农村妇女生产健全地向前发展，必须正确地贯彻“组织起来”的政策，大力动员妇女群众参加各种合作社（如农业变工互助组，纺织小组之类的生产合作社，与供销合作社等）。在农业生产方面，妇女以参加户与户的合作、男女都可以参加的小型互助组为宜。在手工业及副业方面，妇女以参加各种供销合作社为宜。在方法上，必须实行自愿和两利的原则，发挥民主精神，鼓励群众创造性，力戒过分干涉，强迫命令，形式主义，同时也不能陷于自流。
    以生产为中心，并在生产过程之中，加强对于妇女的教育工作，提高妇女政治觉悟，文化水平，动员妇女参加民主建政，推进妇婴卫生（如举办妇婴卫生干部训练班，组织中、西医药合作社等），保护妇女特殊利益。对于阻碍妇女参加政治、经济、文化活动的（首先是参加生产的）封建思想传统习俗，必须有意识和有步骤地去消除之。不应以为只要妇女参加生产，在社会上存留的一些对于妇女的封建束缚，就会自然而然地消除，不必再去进行什么工作了，这种自流主义，不注意妇女特殊利益的观点，也是错误的。在生产过程中，应经过各种群众组织和会议，经常对全体农民进行男女平等的思想教育，批评封建思想和传统习俗，指出一切束缚妇女的封建习俗，均必须废除。对于要保持旧的封建习俗、经常欺压妇女的少数落后分子，必要时尚须适当地进行斗争。但是必须了解，这种斗争是属于农民内部的思想斗争，与反对封建地主的阶级斗争应有严格区别。而且这种斗争的目的，是为了更有效地教育全体农民，更有利于动员妇女参加生产及其他建设事业，建立真正民主和睦的家庭，并更加巩固和加强农民内部的团结。同时，也必须认识，这是改造农民思想的工作，是长期努力的过程，不能操之过急。我们应反对自流，同时也应反对急性病。对于缠足、溺婴、买卖婚、童养媳等，应由政府颁布命令加以禁止，同时进行教育群众，力求贯彻。在解放区，过去有些地区的婚姻法，其中若干部分，违反男女平等、婚姻自由的原则，应迅速加以修改。
    在新解放区的农村妇女工作的方针，应根据中央对新区工作的指示，宣传党的政策（包含妇女工作政策），扩大党的影响，揭破敌人的一切造谣污蔑武断宣传，安定社会秩序，在进行减租减息或实行土地改革的地区，应发动广大妇女群众积极参加，并领导和组织妇女参加生产建设，和支援战争。那些新的地区，在实行减租减息或分得了土地之后，劳动生产同样是妇女工作的中心环节。至于束缚妇女的封建传统习俗，在新区必然是很严重的，因此必须在广大群众中进行男女平等的教育，启发群众觉悟，按其觉悟的程度，有意识有步骤地逐渐破除之。
    （三）关于妇女群众的组织形式问题，过去有一些地区，曾经取消了妇女群众的单独组织，或者名存实亡，这是不适当的。根据中国妇女目前的具体情况，还是须要有单独的妇女群众组织，以便领导和推动妇女工作，团结和教育广大妇女群众，经常为妇女服务。
    妇女代表会议是更广泛地更民主地联系妇女群众的最好的组织形式，各地各级均应有此种组织。村级妇女代表会议，是这种代表会议的基层组织。其代表的产生，应由妇女群众民主选举，必须包含人民代表会的女代表，妇女团体的代表（如纺织组、合作社、识字班等的女代表），及广大妇女群众直接选出的代表（可按居住条件由一定数目的妇女选举）。这种代表会议的作用，是代表妇女群众的意见，讨论当地妇女工作的方针任务及重要工作，传达民主政府及上级组织的政策法令或决议，发动广大妇女群众共同执行。同时应由代表会议选出委员会，贯彻决议，主持日常工作，并定期召开代表会议。这种委员会的名称，可根据群众意见规定。在群众对妇联会已经熟悉的地方，可称为妇联会的委员会。又为着充实有组织的群众基础，妇女代表会议的委员会，应运用各种各样的组织形式，如识字班、合作社、互助组等，去组织各种要求不同的妇女群众；同时也必须经常与广大无组织的妇女群众联系，并为其服务。
    县以上，也应根据上述原则召开妇女代表会议，选出妇女联合会的委员会，领导妇女工作。
    过去有少数地区的妇联会，不是从群众实际情况出发，在组织上形式主义地强调发展会员，过多地开小组会，长期不召开代表会议；在工作上强迫命令，形式主义地完成所谓上级任务，而不是为群众服务；因而使妇联会在实质上脱离了群众，成为少数人包办的机关。这种不良现象，今后应努力纠正。
    在新解放的农村，当着局面初步稳定以后，可以建立妇女组织。但是，事前必须有步骤有计划地进行准备工作，根据群众需要及觉悟程度，逐步地建立妇女组织，团结和教育广大妇女群众。这种妇女团体必须以劳动妇女为基础。
    （四）根据目前革命形势发展的需要，必须大胆培养、放手使用和提拔大批的党与非党的女干部，到各种工作岗位上去，并加强各级妇女组织的干部。男女干部同等能力者，应当分配同等工作，给予同等培养和教育的机会，不得加以歧视；并应按女干部的特殊情况，更加注意提高其政治、理论、文化的水平及工作能力，帮助其解决特殊困难，举办保育院、托儿所、或组织女干部变工互助带孩子，以减轻女干部的困难，而且可以作为开展社会上的儿童保育事业的起点。对农村新起的劳动妇女干部，特别要在原有的工作岗位上加强教育，耐心培养，逐步提拔，并注意发展女党员。在新区特别注意培养本地的妇女干部。各级党校和政府主办的训练班，应有计划地吸收女干部学习，党的各级组织部宣传部应把培养和教育女干部列入其业务之内。而女干部本身，则应在党的领导教育之下，自觉地积极工作，精通业务，加强团结，提高工作效率，努力学习理论、政策、文化知识、生产业务的知识和技能，开展批评与自我批评，克服妇女的弱点，力求进步，加强为人民服务的思想。这是提高自己成为党的优秀干部的基本条件。
    （五）从一九四七年全国土地会议以后，各级党委对妇女工作的领导，一般地较前重视，有了若干改进，但尚未做到经常地有计划地去贯彻对妇女工作的领导，妇女工作表现有上紧下紧，上松下松的被动现象。尚有少数党委，未曾克服对于妇女工作的轻忽自流现象。今后，全党必须全面地认识动员广大妇女群众参加革命斗争，是争取全国革命胜利不可缺少的力量，更加加强领导妇女工作，贯彻全党作妇女工作的方针。各级党委应把妇女工作列为党的整个工作的一部分，在布置检查和总结各种工作时，应把妇女工作包括在内。各级党报和通讯社，应当加强对妇女工作的宣传报导。县以上各级党委，应建立和健全妇委组织，并经常加以指导和帮助。区以下，经过支部领导妇女工作，并应确定专人负责。各级妇女的职责，是在同级党委领导之下，研究妇女问题和妇女政策，检查妇女工作，并向党委提出建议，以指导及推动妇女工作。
    党应更进一步地纠正党内外残存的重男轻女的封建思想，和把妇女工作从整个工作中除外的取消思想，以及孤立突出地去作妇女工作的偏向。各级党的组织应加强学习和运用马列主义、毛泽东思想指导妇女工作，培植完整的群众观点，正确地掌握妇运政策，克服妇女工作中的无纪律无政府现象。妇女工作者更应实事求是，深入群众，埋头苦干，全心全意为妇女群众服务，把妇女运动更向前推进一步。
    （六）为适应全国革命发展的需要，集中妇女的战斗力量，解放区妇女团体，应当努力去联合全国一切反对美帝国主义，反对封建主义，反对官僚资本主义的妇女，共同为驱逐美帝国主义出中国，打倒国民党反动统治，建立统一的新民主主义的人民共和国而奋斗。为此特决定由解放区妇女团体发起于一九四九年春季召开全国妇女代表大会，成立全国民主妇女联合会，使全国妇女运动能在统一的方针领导下，更大地和更有力地向前发展。
