(Taihang Electric Dispatch) More than one hundred remnant bandits who fled from Jixian County to Xinxiang were annihilated and captured by our Taihang local armed forces. Simultaneously, three strongholds on the outskirts of Xinxiang were captured. On the 7th, when our army liberated Jixian County, the remnants of the bandits defending the city fled towards Xinxiang. However, upon reaching the walls of Xinxiang, the Chiang bandits refused to allow them into the city, ordering them to occupy the area outside the city and resist on the spot. On the 22nd of this month, a unit of the Taihang 5th Military Sub-district's local armed forces, after a forced march of more than thirty li, raided Yuzhai, Xiaohuangtun, and Quli, outposts of the Chiang bandits ten li northeast of Xinxiang. At dawn on the 21st, our army launched an attack, victoriously concluding the battle at 11:00 AM. Except for the enemy's township office in Xiaohuangtun, which seized the opportunity to flee back to their lair under the heavy reinforcement of Chiang bandits from Xinxiang, most of the bandits guarding Yuzhai and Quli were annihilated. We immediately captured the aforementioned strongholds. In this battle, nine enemies were killed or wounded, and Liu ×qing, the Kuomintang magistrate of Jixian County, and Ji Youlan, the director of the Southwest Township Joint Defense Command of Jixian County, along with 141 other bandits, were captured, and a portion of weapons and ammunition was seized.

(Another Electric Dispatch) The Chiang bandits besieged in the isolated strongholds of Xinxiang and Anyang by our army are on the verge of running out of ammunition and food, making desperate struggles from time to time. They have successively gathered large forces, risking death to go out and seize grain and conscript soldiers. On the 11th of this month, the entire 117th Regiment of the 106th Division of the Chiang bandits, nearly 2,000 men, trapped on the isolated island of Xinxiang, conducted grain seizures in the areas of Daijiaying, Dazhaoying, and Dianhouying west of Xinxiang. They were fiercely attacked by our Xiuwu Independent Battalion, after which the enemy scurried back into the city in a panic. The next day (December 12th), the entire regiment and the sapper battalion, along with a mountain artillery company, totaling 4,000 bandit troops, again conducted looting activities in the Dazhaoying area. After effective resistance from our army, on the morning of the 13th, they scurried to Xiaoji Station and other places, vainly attempting to expand the outer strongholds to seize grain. However, fearing annihilation by our powerful People's Liberation Army, these Chiang bandit troops did not dare to stay long and fled back to their lairs in panic. The extremely panicked bandits in the isolated city of Anyang also sent a battalion on the 19th to invade Xindianji and other places to conscript soldiers and seize grain. Our Yexian Brigade gave them a severe blow, and the enemy fled back in disarray. In the above-mentioned several battles, more than 70 enemy soldiers were killed, wounded, or captured.
