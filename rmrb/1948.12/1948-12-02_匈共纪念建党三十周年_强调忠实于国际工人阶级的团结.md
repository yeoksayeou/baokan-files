Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th: Budapest dispatch: November 21st was the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Hungarian Communist Party. The Hungarian Working People's Party (formed by the merger of the Hungarian Communist Party and the Social Democratic Party in June this year) held a celebration meeting here on the 20th. Attending the meeting were thousands of representatives from party organizations at all levels in the capital and working people in the suburbs. Szakasits, Chairman of the Working People's Party and President of the Hungarian Republic (formerly the General Secretary of the Social Democratic Party), emphasized in his opening speech: "Without the Hungarian Communist Party's firm and unwavering struggle, the Hungarian workers' movement would have lost its revolutionary momentum. The unity of the working class, which the Hungarian Communist Party strived for, has now been achieved." Rakosi, General Secretary of the Working People's Party (formerly the General Secretary of the Hungarian Communist Party), then delivered a long speech, reviewing the Hungarian Communist Party's struggle during the 1918 revolution and the Hungarian Soviet Republic, the twenty-five years of arduous underground struggle during the rule of Horthy (the dictator and traitor of Hungary before and during World War II), and after the liberation of Hungary, the Hungarian Communist Party united the working class and all working people around itself in the land reform and domestic political struggle, and won the victory. Rakosi pointed out: "The establishment of the Working People's Party completed the process of consolidating Hungarian democracy." Rakosi's speech was met with thunderous applause and cheers from the masses.

The party organizations of the Working People's Party in industrial enterprises and villages across the country also held commemorative meetings. The Central Committee of the Working People's Party also issued commemorative slogans, emphasizing loyalty to the solidarity of the international working class and friendship with the Soviet Union, and fighting against rural capitalist elements and reactionary pastors subsidized by foreign countries.

    匈共纪念建党三十周年
  　强调忠实于国际工人阶级的团结
    【新华社陕北二十六日电】布达佩斯讯：十一月廿一日是匈牙利共产党建党三十周年纪念日，匈牙利劳动人民党（为匈牙利共产党及社会民主党于今年六月间合并而成）于二十日在此间举行庆祝会。到会的有首都各级党组织及市郊劳动人民的代表数千人。劳动人民党主席、匈牙利共和国总统斯查卡西兹（合并前为社会民主党总书记）在开幕词中强调指出：“如果没有匈共坚强不渝的斗争，匈牙利工人运动就会丧失其革命的动力。匈共所努力争取的工人阶级的统一，现在已经实现了。”劳动人民党总书记拉科西（合并前的匈共总书记）继即发表长篇演说，回顾匈共在一九一八年革命时期和匈牙利苏维埃共和国时期，在霍尔梯（二次大战以前和战时匈牙利的独裁者和卖国贼）统治时期的二十五年艰苦的地下斗争，以及匈牙利解放后，匈共在土地改革和国内政治斗争中，把工人阶级和全体劳动人民团结在自己的周围，并赢得了胜利的经过。拉科西指出：“劳动人民党的成立，完成了巩固匈牙利民主的过程”。拉科西的演说获得了群众雷动的掌声和欢呼。
    劳动人民党在全国各工业企业及乡村中的党组织亦均举行纪念会。劳动人民党中央并颁布纪念口号，强调忠实于国际工人阶级的团结及对苏友谊，对农村资本主义因素及受外国津贴的反动牧师进行斗争。
