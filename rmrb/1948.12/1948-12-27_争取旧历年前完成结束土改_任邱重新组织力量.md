　　Strive to Complete Land Reform Before the Lunar New Year
  　Renqiu Reorganizes Forces
    [Jizhong Electric] After receiving the supplementary instructions for winter work from the District Party Committee, the Renqiu County Party Committee summarized and criticized the work in key villages in the previous stage, in order to comprehensively complete the land reform before the Lunar New Year. They also organized the strength of county and district cadres and arranged the work for the next stage.
    In the first stage of implementing the concluding of land reform and party rectification work, the County Party Committee identified a total of thirteen key villages. From the time of intervention until now, which is more than twenty days, the County Party Committee has convened three meetings to summarize and introduce experiences in a timely manner, and to correct some deviations in the work. At the beginning of the work, all key villages paid attention to conducting investigations and research in conjunction with the tax collection; during the conclusion of land reform, they conducted party rectification education in conjunction with it, so that some party members and cadres who were in low spirits and not working initially understood their thinking and began to work. So far, the key villages for concluding land reform, except for Qunian Village and Xili Gezhuang Village, have generally completed the work of correcting wrongly classified statuses, compensating middle peasants, and distributing houses and floating property; Changxindian has also issued land certificates. Jianglinhe and other four villages have also established civil schools in conjunction with the end of land reform, and Xiguxian and other three villages have rectified the war support teams.
    In the implementation of this stage, some problems and deviations also occurred. The more serious one was that right-leaning sentiments occurred again while correcting left-leaning errors. For example, in Dongzhuang Village, Tenth District, when correcting policies this time, individual households who were wrongly classified mistakenly wanted to retaliate against poor and hired peasants; they contacted some branch committee members who were dissatisfied with last year's land reform, and under the pretext of returning things for compensation, they shouted and made trouble in the village, and even detained several poor and hired peasants, scaring many poor and hired peasants to run to other villages, forcing them to ask for the return of things and find someone to "mediate." When the district dealt with this problem, it developed right-leaning sentiments and did not rely on upright branch committee members and party members within the party to mobilize the broad masses of people to unite the middle peasants. On the one hand, it educated the peasants to unite and earnestly correct the policies, and at the same time gave education and necessary punishment to individual retaliatory elements; it simply mediated, and considered it resolved. As a result, the poor and hired peasants were in very low spirits, and some showed suspicion and panic.
    Some key villages could not adhere to the Party's mass line, and after establishing the leadership of the branch, the phenomenon of detachment and monopolizing the peasant representative conferences occurred again. As a result, the peasant representative conferences could not play their due role, and the broad masses could not be mobilized.
    In implementing the party rectification policy, they did not grasp the solution of erroneous thinking, but simply accommodated the party members. As a result, because the thinking was not clarified, some still took the lead in creating trouble with the new cadres.
    Since receiving the supplementary instructions from the District Party Committee and the Prefectural Party Committee, the County Party Committee, in order to comprehensively complete the land reform before the Lunar New Year, has now decided to reorganize the cadre forces: the county-level departments have drawn fourteen more cadres to form a joint office; then draw forty-two cadres to participate in the land reform work in various districts; each district also determined to use two-thirds of its strength to conclude land reform, and one-third of its strength to support the war, and in villages where conditions permit, combine the reorganization of four types of task forces. After this organization was completed, a county and district cadre meeting was convened on December 3, emphasizing that in the future conclusion of land reform, it is necessary to grasp the struggle on two fronts, and both the residual left-leaning tendencies of the past and the right-leaning tendencies that have recently occurred must be corrected. In leadership work, we must adhere to the Party's mass line: on the one hand, we must rely on the branch and establish the leadership core of the branch; at the same time, we should let go and mobilize the masses, and prevent and correct the phenomenon of monopolization.

　　争取旧历年前完成结束土改
  　任邱重新组织力量
    【冀中电】任邱县委自接到区党委冬季工作补充指示以后，为了在旧历年前全面的完成结束土改，对前一段重点村工作，进行了总结和批判，并组织了县区干部力量，布置了下一段的工作。
    县委在执行结束土改和整党工作的第一阶段，一共确定了十三个重点村。从插手工作到现在二十多天的时间里，县委曾集合过三次，及时的总结和介绍了经验，纠正了工作中的一些偏向。各重点村在工作一开始，都注意了结合征收，进行调查研究情况；在结束土改中，结合着进行了整党教育，使一部分情绪低落不做工作的党员干部，初步搞通了思想，开始工作起来。到现在为止，各个结束土改重点村，除去年村和西李各庄等村以外一般的作完了改正错订成份，补偿中农，分配房子浮财等工作；长辛店并已发完了土地证。姜临河等四个村，还结合结束土改成立了民校，西古贤等三个村，整顿了战勤队。
    这一阶段在执行工作中，也发生了一些问题和偏向。比较严重的是，在纠正左倾错中有的又发生了右倾情绪。比如十区东庄村，在这次端正政策时，个别被错订成份户，错误的想报复贫雇农；他们联络了一部分对去年土改不满的支部委员，以退补东西为借口，在村里大喊大闹，还扣起了几个贫雇农，吓的好多贫雇农跑到外村去，被迫着要求退东西、找人“说合”等。区里在处理这个问题时，发生了右倾情绪，没有依靠党内正派的支委党员，发动广大的人民团结中农，一方面在教育农民团结下来认真端正政策，同时对个别报复分子，给以教育和必要的处分；只是简单的说合了说合，就算解决了。结果贫雇农情绪很低落，有的表现怀疑和恐慌。
    有的重点村，不能坚持党的群众路线，在树立了支部的领导之后，又发生了脱开和包办农代会的现象。以致农代会不能发挥应有的作用，也就不能发动起广大群众来。
    在贯彻整党方针上，没有抓紧解决错误思想，只一味的迁就党员，结果因为思想未搞通，有的仍旧挑头和新干部闹蹩扭。
    自从接到区党委和地委的补充指示以后，县委为了在旧历年前全面完成结束土改，现已决定重新组织干部力量：县级各部门又抽出了十四个干部，组织成联合办公室；再抽出四十二个干部，参加各区结束土改工作；各区也确定以三分之二的力量作结束土改，三分之一的力量以支援战争为主，在条件许可的村，结合整编四种任务队。这样组织好以后，就在十二月三日召开了县区干部会议，强调指出：在今后结束土改中，必须掌握两条战线的斗争，过去残存的左倾偏向和最近发生的右倾偏向都必须纠正。在领导工作上必须坚持党的群众路线：一方面要依靠支部，树立支部的领导核心；同时还应该放手发动群众，防止和纠正包办现象。
