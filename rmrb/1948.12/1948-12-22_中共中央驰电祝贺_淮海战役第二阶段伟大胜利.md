Comrades Liu Bocheng, Chen Yi, Deng Xiaoping, Rao Shushi, Zhang Yunyi, Su Yu, Tan Zhenlin, Chen Geng, and all comrades of the Central Plains People's Liberation Army and the East China People's Liberation Army: We congratulate you on winning the great victory in the second stage after the great victory in the first stage of the Huaihai Campaign. From November 23rd to December 17th, you liberated the strategic stronghold of Xuzhou; completely annihilated the entire 12th Corps of Huang Wei, one of the Kuomintang's most elite corps, consisting of four armies and ten divisions, and a rapid column; captured Huang Wei and Wu Shaozhou, the commander and deputy commander of the corps; won over the defection of Liao Yunzhou's 110th Division of the Huang Wei Corps; surrounded the Qiu Qingquan, Li Mi, and Sun Yuanliang corps of Du Yuming's bandit troops who fled from Xuzhou in the direction of Yongcheng, and annihilated more than one-third of the enemy; severely attacked the Li Yannian and Liu Ruming corps who were reinforcing from Bengbu to the northwest, forcing them to flee back south of the Huai River, thus completely isolating Du Yuming's bandit troops in the northeast area of Yongcheng, with their food and aid exhausted, awaiting death; at the same time, you also liberated Huaiyin and Huaian, captured Lingbi, and liberated the entire territory north of the Huai River, except for the small strongholds occupied by Du Yuming's bandit troops in the northeast area of Yongcheng, which is extremely beneficial for future operations. All these great achievements are the result of the heroic efforts of our officers and soldiers and the concerted cooperation of the Party, government, army, and people in the front and rear. We extend to you our warm congratulations and sincere regards. We hope that you will unite all the soldiers and civilians, continue to work hard, and fight for the complete annihilation of the bandit troops in front of you!
