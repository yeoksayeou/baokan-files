(Hebei-Chahar-Hebei Electric) The production promotion cooperatives in some counties of the Ninth Sub-district of Hebei-Chahar-Hebei have begun to conscientiously collect old loans. In the past, this area neglected the work of collecting old loans, and failed to recover the loaned funds on time, which affected the support for mass winter production. The reasons are: (1) Some cadres have the idea of emphasizing lending and de-emphasizing recovery, thinking that lending the money is the completion of the task. In Ding County, because there is no lower-level loan agency, the money is given to administrative cadres, so there are no procedures after the loan is issued. In the seventh district of Anguo County, which was划to Shenze County, there were 6.56 million yuan, and it is not known who it was lent to. Some cadres of the Anguo First Branch said to the masses when lending: "You can borrow it, it doesn't matter, it's not certain whether we will collect it or not, it's okay if you can't pay it back when it's due." A loan cadre in Suning County, in order to lend the money out early, when the masses said they wanted to borrow 5 million, he said: "What can you do with that? Borrow 10 million." The masses who borrowed lime in Liu Zhuangzi, Anxin, wanted to pay in installments, but the cadres refused to collect it because it was too much trouble, and were willing to wait until it was all collected at once. (2) Some places cannot combine lending and collecting old loans well. Suning County set up special personnel for collection work, and loan cadres did not care about collection. When it was time to plant wheat, many loans were due, but the county cooperative cadres were only busy with wheat planting work and did not combine it well with collection. In Anxin, those who lent for indigo planting did not collect the money, so many overdue loans could not be recovered. Therefore, after receiving the instruction that no more funds would be added for winter production, these places thought about collecting, and then it was time for the autumn levy, which increased the difficulty of collection. After reviewing some shortcomings, since October, all localities have begun to pay attention to collection work, and have achieved some results. The Qianjin Cooperative in Xinle County focused on collection, learned from experience to promote nearby villages, and guided other districts. The Fourth Branch took Kong Village as the focus, first found loan households with positive production and good credit, and persuaded them to take the lead in paying first, and then persuaded and mobilized the general loan households. In this way, in just two days, it collected 2,300 catties of millet, and other loan households whose loans were due were also actively preparing to repay. In two districts, a total of 11,244 catties of millet and more than 7.67 million yuan were recovered in ten days. Some branches in Anguo County have established close contact with the district committee, and the district committee has sent letters to the village branches, requiring party members to play an exemplary role in paying. According to incomplete statistics from Gaoyang, Xinle, Ding County, Suning, Li County, Qingyuan, Anxin, Boye, Anping and other counties, from November 5th to 15th, in ten days, 109.2 million yuan of Hebei currency (Qingyuan missing) and 51,145 catties of grain (Li County, Boye, Anping missing) have been recovered. After education, these loan households have recognized the significance of government loans, and are very active in paying.

### 说服动员催收旧贷　冀中九分区有些县已取得成绩

　　说服动员催收旧贷
  　冀中九分区有些县已取得成绩
    【冀中电】九分区有些县的生产推进社，开始认真摧收旧贷。该地过去曾忽视旧贷催收工作，不能把贷出去的款按期收回，影响了扶植群众冬季生产。原因是：（一）有些干部存在重发放，轻收回的思想，认为把款放下去就算完成了任务。定县因为没有贷款的下层机构，把款交给行政干部，使款贷出后没有手续，该县划到深泽县去的七区，有六百五十六万元，还不知道是贷给谁了。安国一分社有的干部放款时对群众说：“你们贷吧，没关系，还不一定往回收不收呢，到期还不起就算了”。肃宁有个贷款干部，为了早把款放出去，群众说贷五百万，他说：“那够干啥？贷一千万吧”。安新刘庄子贷的白灰款，群众说零还，干部不收，赚麻烦，愿等齐了一块收。（二）有些地方贷款和催收旧贷不能很好结合。肃宁县催收工作设专人，贷款干部又不管催收。种麦的时候，贷款到期的很多，县社干部只忙于种麦工作，没有很好结合催收。安新的种靛贷款，收买土靛的人不管收款，使好多到期的贷款不能收回来。因此，常接到冬季生产不再增加资金的指示以后，这些地方想着催收，又赶上秋季征收了，这增加了催收的困难。有些缺点经过检讨以后，各地从十月份，都开始注意了催收工作，已收到了一些成绩。新乐县前进社从重点催收，吸取经验推动附近村，指导别的区。四分社把孔村当作重点，首先找生产积极信用好的贷款户，说服他们带头先交，再找一般贷款户进行说服动员，这样只两天的工夫，就收小米二千三百斤，别的到期的贷款户，也纷纷做还款的准备。两个区十天共收回小米一万一千二百四十四斤，款七百六十七万多元。安国有的分社和区委取得密切联系，区委给村支部去信，要求党员在交款中起模范带头作用。据高阳、新乐、定县、肃宁、蠡县、清苑、安新、博野、安平等县不完全统计，从十一月五日到十五日十天的工夫，已收回了冀钞一万万零九十二万元（缺清苑），收回粮五万一千一百四十五斤（缺蠡县、博野、安平）。这些贷款户经过教育，认清了政府贷款的意义，交款都很积极。
