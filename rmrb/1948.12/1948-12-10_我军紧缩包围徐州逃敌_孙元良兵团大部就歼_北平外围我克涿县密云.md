　　Xinhua News Agency, Huaihai Front, 7th—Sun Yuanliang's 16th Army Corps, one of the three enemy army corps besieged in the Lishilin area southwest of Xiaoxian, Xuzhou, and northeast of Yongcheng, has been mostly annihilated. This army corps, consisting of two armies (the 41st and 47th) and four divisions (the 122nd, 124th, 125th, and 127th), has suffered heavy casualties in continuous battles since fleeing Xuzhou, and their morale was chaotic. On the night of the 6th, Sun Yuanliang led his troops in a breakout, and by the morning of the 7th, they were almost completely annihilated. We captured over 10,000 enemy troops, including Chen Yuanxiang, deputy commander of the 41st Army, and Zhang Guanghan, commander of the 127th Division. A small number of remnants have completely collapsed. Furthermore, the People's Liberation Army began tightening the encirclement of the enemy besieged in the Lishilin area on the 6th and had captured more than ten villages and towns, including Mengji, Liuhe, Zhaozhuang, and Qianpingzhuang, by noon on the 7th, annihilating the entire 599th Regiment (minus two companies) of the 200th Division of the enemy's Fifth Army and part of the 598th Regiment. The entire 510th Regiment of the 170th Division of the Eighth Army was annihilated. The besieged enemy is now at a dead end, and the People's Liberation Army is accelerating its encirclement and annihilation.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Xuzhou, 7th—The People's Liberation Army, upon entering Xuzhou, was warmly welcomed by the people of Xuzhou City. When the People's Liberation Army marched into the city on the 2nd, the streets were crowded with welcoming masses. The people of Xuzhou, who had long suffered under the rule of the Kuomintang bandits, showed no fear of the People's Liberation Army. Many citizens eagerly spoke with the staff of the People's Liberation Army, recounting their tragic lives under Kuomintang rule. Citizens eagerly read and even wished to purchase the propaganda of the People's Liberation Army. Knowing the policies of the People's Liberation Army in cities such as Kaifeng and Jinan, most employees of Xuzhou's public institutions, factories, and enterprises remained at their posts, orderly awaiting the takeover by the People's Liberation Army. Employees' associations at the Xuzhou North and East Railway Stations automatically organized to resist saboteurs and protect the factories and stations, keeping a large number of vehicles intact. The people of Xuzhou South Gate also automatically picked up dozens of rifles abandoned by the Kuomintang bandit army to maintain order and assist the People's Liberation Army in protecting warehouses. Employees of postal and telecommunications agencies and radio stations remained at their posts, and some electricity was restored on the evening of the 2nd. On the same day, hundreds of police officers reported for duty, awaiting orders, and traffic police began work that afternoon, maintaining traffic. Most teachers and students of various middle schools remained in school.
　　Report from the Ping-Bao Front—The enemy 273rd Division of the 101st Army guarding the strategically important military location of Zhuoxian on the Ping-Bao Line, fearing annihilation, fled north at 1:00 PM on the 7th. The city and its surrounding vast area have been liberated by us. There are now no enemy traces south of the Liangxiang Doudian Station on the Ping-Bao Line. Our army has controlled 114.5 kilometers (approximately 230 li) of the railway line from north of Baoding to south of Doudian Station on the Ping-Bao Line. Zhuoxian is located ninety li south of Beiping and is an important southern shield for Beiping. With the liberation of Zhuoxian, the southern gate of Beiping has been opened.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Ji-Cha-Re-Liao, 8th—Miyun County, located on the Ping-Gu Railway approximately eighty kilometers northeast of Beiping, was liberated on the 5th. The People's Liberation Army launched an attack on Miyun City at 8:00 AM on the 5th and completely occupied the city by 8:00 PM that evening. Two regiments of the 155th Division and 297th Division of Shi Jue's 13th Army, the defending enemy, were almost completely annihilated except for a few who fled. The results of the battle are still being tallied.
