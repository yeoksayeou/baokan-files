　　Mingz then explained the specific contents of the Six-Year Plan:
    Industrial Aspect
    The Six-Year Plan stipulates that industrial output will increase by 11 to 12 percent annually. Even during periods of capitalist expansion, no capitalist country has ever experienced such rapid industrial expansion. However, on the other hand, the rate of expansion stipulated by the Polish Six-Year Plan will not be as intense as during the Soviet Union's first and second Five-Year Plans, because Poland is not as isolated as the Soviet Union was then. Poland now has the strong support of the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries.
    The fastest industrial expansion in the Six-Year Plan will be in the production of basic means of production, excluding the coal mining industry, because the coal mining industry will reach a very high level by the end of 1949. Steel production, which will increase with the growth of the hardware and machine manufacturing industries, will be nearly double that of pre-war production, an increase of 50 percent over 1949. This is possible because the Soviet Union has already supplied equipment for the large new steel plant established by Poland in Gliwice, which can produce 1.5 million tons of steel annually. The equipment for this plant was supplied by the Soviet Union in January 1948 under the Soviet-Polish investment agreement. Another large new steel plant will also begin production during the Six-Year Plan. During the Six-Year Plan, a large-scale, modern chemical industry will be built, with production increasing to three times that of 1949. The chemical industry will become Poland's second largest industry after coal mining. Tractor production, which is the basis for agricultural mechanization, will increase about sixfold, reaching an annual output of 10,000 to 12,000 units by 1955. The annual output of automobiles will reach 10,000 vehicles. According to the Six-Year Plan, electricity production will be double that of 1949. The production of consumer goods will also increase significantly: cotton fabrics will increase by 50 percent, wool fabrics by 30 percent, linen by twofold, shoes by 2.5-fold, and sugar production will allow each person to consume 24 kilograms per year.
    One of the goals of the Six-Year Plan is to eliminate, or at least partially eliminate, the current imbalance in industrial distribution. This goal strongly reflects the class content of the plan. The working class, as the leading force, should be distributed throughout the country. Therefore, among the 300,000 workers to be employed by the new large industrial enterprises to be built in the Six-Year Plan, 200,000 will be employed in areas outside the current industrial centers.
    Agricultural Aspect
    The Six-Year Plan stipulates an increase in agricultural production of 35 to 45 percent. This increase is impossible in capitalist countries, but it is achievable in people's Poland, because: 1. During the six-year period, agriculture will receive 50,000 to 60,000 domestically manufactured and imported tractors, as well as a considerable number of trucks and lorries. 2. During the Six-Year Plan, 8,000 to 10,000 villages will be electrified. 3. The government will promote modern agricultural technology throughout the countryside. 4. State-owned farms, which own 10 percent of the country's arable land, will become models of socialist agriculture. 5. Poor and middle peasants will receive all possible assistance and will be protected from exploitation by capitalist elements. 6. Agricultural production cooperatives will gradually develop on a voluntary basis. Production cooperatives will have a decisive impact on the increase in agricultural production.
    Regarding the issue of investment: According to the Six-Year Plan, the percentage of national income allocated to investment will be determined on a parallel basis, that is, "ensuring the maximum possible development of the economy and the most rapid possible increase in the welfare and cultural level of the working masses."
    Regarding the training and education of workers: During the six years, 900,000 workers will be trained for industries other than agriculture. Poland will follow the example of the Soviet Union in training new technical personnel and professional intellectuals from the working class. Under the people's democratic regime, tens of thousands of workers have been promoted to supervisors and managers, but they lack general education and specialized technical knowledge, and they will receive training in specialized schools.

### 六年计划具体内容

　　六年计划具体内容
    明兹继而说明六年计划的具体内容：
    工业方面
    六年计划规定工业产量每年增加百分之十一到十二。即使在资本主义扩展时期，任何资本主义国家工业扩展的速度，都没有这样快。但另一方面，波兰六年计划所规定的扩展速度，将不象苏联第一个和第二个五年计划时期那样紧张，因为波兰不象苏联当时那样孤立，波兰现在有苏联和人民民主国家有力的支持。
    六年计划中工业扩展的速度。最快的将是除采煤工业以外的基本生产手段的生产，因为采煤工业在一九四九年底就会达到很高的水平。随五金和机器制造工业之增长而提高的钢铁生产，将近于战前生产的两倍，将比一九四九年增加百分之五十。这是可能的，因为苏联已经以装备供给了波兰在格利维斯所建立的新的大炼钢厂，这个大炼钢厂每年可产钢一百五十万吨。该厂的装备是根据波苏投资协议，于一九四八年一月由苏联供给的。另一个新的大炼钢厂，也将在六年计划期间开始生产。在六年计划期间，将建设一个庞大的现代化的化学工业，生产量将增加到一九四九年的三倍。化学工业将为仅次于采煤工业的波兰第二大工业。为农业机械化之基础的拖拉机生产，将增加约六倍，到一九五五年，拖拉机的年产量将达一万至一万二千部。汽车的年产量将达一万辆。根据六年计划，电力生产将为一九四九年的两倍。消费品的生产，也将有相当的增加：棉织品将增加百分之五十，毛织品增加百分之三十，亚麻布增加到两倍，鞋增加到二点五倍，糖的生产将使每人每年能消费二十四公斤。
    六年计划的目的之一，是要消除目前工业分布的不平衡性，最少也要部分地消除。这一目的着重地表现了计划的阶级内容。作为领导力量的工人阶级，应该分布在全国各地。因此，六年计划中要建设的新的大工业企业所要雇用的三十万工人中，将有二十万人在现在的工业中心以外的地方雇用。
    农业方面
    六年计划规定农业增产百分之三十五至四十五。这种增加在资本主义国家中是不可能的，而在人民的波兰，则是可以实现的。因为：一，在六年的时期中，农业将获得本国制造与国外输入的拖拉机五万至六万架及相当数量的运货大卡车与卡车。二，在六年计划期间，将有八千到一万个乡村电气化。三，政府将把现代化农业技术推广到农村各地。四，拥有全国百分之十可耕地的国营农场，将变成社会主义农业的模范。五，贫农、中农将得到一切可能的帮助，且将受到保护，免受资本主义因素的剥削。六，农业生产合作社将逐渐地基于自愿的原则来发展。生产合作社将对农业生产的增加起决定性的影响。
    关于投资问题：依照六年计划，投资所占国民收入的百分比，将在齐头并进的基础上来决定，即“保证经济最大可能的发展与劳动大众福利及文化水平的最迅速的可能的增进。”
    关于工人的培养与教育：六年中将为农业以外的其他行业训练九十万工人。波兰将仿效苏联的榜样，从工人阶级中培养新的技术人材与职业知识分子。在人民民主政权下，曾经擢升了数以万计的工人为主管人员与经理，但是，他们缺乏一般的教育与专门技术知识，他们将在专科学校受训。
