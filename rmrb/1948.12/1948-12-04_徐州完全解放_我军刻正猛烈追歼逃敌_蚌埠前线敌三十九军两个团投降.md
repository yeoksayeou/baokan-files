Xinhua News Agency, Huaihai Front, Urgent Telegram, 2nd: Xuzhou, the most important military strategic point in East China, was completely liberated at 10 PM last night. The defending enemy's Qiu Qingquan, Li Mi, and Sun Yuanliang army corps are fleeing southwest, and we are vigorously pursuing and annihilating them.

Xinhua News Agency, Huaihai Front, 2nd: The Kuomintang bandit army's Li Yannian army corps' 39th Army's Independent Regiment and Supply Regiment (now changed to Infantry Regiment with American equipment), a total of more than 2,000 men, surrendered to our intercepting troops on the Bengbu front at dusk on the 30th. When Li Yannian and Liu Ruming's two army corps began their desperate escape from Guzhen along both sides of the Jinpu Railway on the 25th of last month, they ordered these two regiments to act as a rearguard. As the People's Liberation Army advanced rapidly southward, these two regiments themselves suffered heavy casualties and fled south in a panic, without rest for three days and three nights, and were extremely exhausted. On the 30th, after fleeing to Nanyuemiao, more than 40 li northwest of Bengbu, they were cut off by our intercepting troops and completely surrounded. The battle continued until dusk, when the enemy's Independent Regiment Colonel Commander Deng Jiufu, Deputy Commander Yang Difei, and Supply Regiment Operations Director Zhu Dechang and other officers, seeing that the general situation was over, chose a way out and led their troops to lay down their weapons. After laying down their weapons and receiving lenient treatment, the officers and soldiers of the two regiments were extremely happy and told our army one after another: The Kuomintang is finished, it is about to collapse, the high-ranking officials are fleeing first, and we are unwilling to be cannon fodder for them.

Xinhua News Agency, Huaihai Front, 2nd: When the People's Liberation Army annihilated the Huang Baitao army corps, it accommodated and treated more than 10,000 abandoned Kuomintang wounded soldiers in Nianzhuang and seven other villages. A certain unit accommodated more than 1,520 Kuomintang wounded soldiers in the Health Department's Second Team, carefully bandaging and changing their dressings, and covering them with their own quilts. Seriously wounded soldiers who could not eat or defecate were all taken care of. The Kuomintang wounded soldiers who were treated were very grateful. Yang Shengui, a soldier of the 65th Division of the 100th Army, said: "Chiang Kai-shek and Huang Baitao wanted us to fight and sell our lives for him, and they didn't care about us if we were killed or wounded. Now that we have come here, the comrades send food and water and treat us like our own people." However, the Kuomintang bandit gang cruelly insisted on putting these wounded soldiers, who had escaped from death, to death. On the day after the capture of Nianzhuang (the 23rd), while a unit of the People's Liberation Army was treating Kuomintang wounded soldiers, several American-made Chiang Kai-shek planes took turns bombing and strafing the area, and many Kuomintang wounded soldiers were tragically bombed to death.

Xinhua News Agency, Huaihai Front, 2nd: Chen Zhiyun, platoon leader of the 8th Company of the 467th Regiment of the Kuomintang Army's 64th Army, and Huang Zhifeng, adjutant of the 3rd Battalion of the 322nd Regiment of the 25th Army, and others, who were captured in the Nianzhuang area, accused Huang Bandit Baitao of his crimes, saying: When Huang Baitao fled west from Xin'anzhen, he forced his officers and soldiers to fill out the so-called "Bandit Suppression and Rebellion Pacification Oath" and asked them to "swear to the heavens" so-called "never surrender, never fear death." During the battle, Huang Bandit ordered the "Supervisory Group" to supervise the battle from behind. From the 18th, the bandit army, trapped in various villages, refused to allow defeated soldiers to enter the village under Huang Bandit's strict orders. After Pengzhuang was captured, hundreds of enemy officers and soldiers fled to Nianzhuang and were immediately shot back. They fled to Dayazhuang, Xiaoyazhuang, and Youjiahu, and were also shot at. Finally, they all surrendered to the People's Liberation Army. Zhao Biguang, commander of the 150th Division of the Kuomintang Army's 44th Army, also led his remaining troops to surrender to the People's Liberation Army under this circumstance. Chen Zhiyun said: "The soldiers were unwilling to fight, but the superiors (referring to Huang Bandit) sent people to tie up three soldiers of the 7th Company who were unwilling to fight and shot them on the position to force all those who were unwilling to fight to die for him."

　　徐州完全解放
  　我军刻正猛烈追歼逃敌
    蚌埠前线敌三十九军两个团投降
    【新华社淮海前线二日急电】华东最重要的军略要地徐州已于昨晚十时完全解放。守敌邱清泉、李弥、孙元良三兵团向西南逃窜，我正猛烈追歼中。
    【新华社淮海前线二日电】国民党匪军李延年兵团三十九军之独立团及辎重团（现已改为步兵团美械装备）两个团全部二千余人，三十日黄昏于蚌埠前线向我截击部队投降。当上月二十五日李延年与刘汝明两兵团由固镇沿津浦线两侧开始向蚌埠狼狈逃窜时，命令这两个团担任掩护。在解放军迅速向南推进中，这两个团本身也因伤亡惨重，慌忙南逃，三天三夜未能休息，疲劳不堪。三十日逃至蚌埠西北四十余里之南岳庙后，又为我截击部队切断归路，团团包围，战斗至黄昏，该敌独立团上校团长邓纠夫、及副团长杨涤非、辎重团作战主任朱德昌等军官，鉴于大势已去，乃选择生路，率部放下武器。该两团官兵于放下武器受到宽大待遇后，欢欣异常，纷纷对我军诉说：国民党不能干了，快倒台了，大官长抢在前面逃命，我们不愿意替他们当炮灰。
    【新华社淮海前线二日电】解放军在歼灭黄伯韬兵团时，收容和治疗了在碾庄等七个村庄中上万名被遗弃的国民党军伤兵。某部在卫生部二队收容一千五百二十余国民党军伤员，细心地给他们包扎换药，并将自己的被子给他们盖。不能吃饭和大小便的重伤员均受到照顾。得到救治的国民党军伤员都十分感激。一百军六十五师士兵杨胜桂说：“蒋介石、黄伯韬要我们给他打仗卖命，死伤了就不管咱，现在来到你们这里，同志们送饭送水，象自己人一样看待。”然而，国民党匪帮却残忍地非把这些绝处逢生的伤员置于死地不可。当碾庄攻克后之次日（二十三日）解放军某部正在医疗国民党军伤员时，美制蒋机数架即曾轮番轰炸扫射该地，国民党军伤员多名惨遭炸毙。
    【新华社淮海前线二日电】碾庄地区被俘之国民党军六十四军四六七团八连排长陈芝云、二十五军三二二团三营上尉副官黄峙峰等，控诉黄匪伯韬的罪行称：当黄伯韬由新安镇西逃时，即强迫其官兵填写所谓“剿匪戡乱誓词”，并要他们“对天盟誓”所谓“决不投降，决不怕死”。作战中黄匪令“督导团”随后督战。十八日起，困守各庄的匪军，在黄匪严令下，拒绝溃败士兵入庄。彭庄被攻克后，敌军数百官兵逃向碾庄，当即被射回，又逃至大牙庄、小牙庄、尤家湖，亦同样遭到射击，最后乃全部向解放军投降。国民党军四十四军一五○师师长赵璧光也在此情形下，率残部向解放军投降。陈芝云说：“士兵们都不愿作战，但上头（指黄匪）派人将七连不愿再打的三个士兵捆至阵地枪毙，来威逼所有不愿打的人替他送死。”
