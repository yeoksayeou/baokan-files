　　Southwest Su County Campaign Ends in Victory
　　Huang Wei's Corps Completely Annihilated
　　Our Army Continues to Tighten Encirclement and Annihilation of Enemy Troops Fleeing Xuzhou
　　[Urgent Dispatch from Xinhua News Agency, Huaihai Front, 16th] The remnants of the Kuomintang bandit Huang Wei's Corps, which were surrounded in the Shuangduiji area southwest of Su County, were completely annihilated at 11:00 PM on the 15th. The enemy began to break out to the west at dusk on the 15th, and the People's Liberation Army immediately intercepted them, annihilating all the enemy attempting to break out by 11:00 PM. The results of the battle are currently being tallied. The Huang Wei Corps consisted of four armies and eleven divisions. In mid-November, they were transferred from southern Henan to reinforce the Xuzhou-Bengbu battlefield. When they reached the Nanpingji area on the south bank of the Hui River southwest of Su County, they were completely surrounded by the People's Liberation Army. This corps was entirely composed of Chiang Kai-shek's direct line troops, and its 18th Army (formerly Hu Lian's reorganized 11th Division) was known as one of the five main forces of the Chiang bandit army. Except for its 110th Division of the 85th Army, which revolted on the 29th of last month under the leadership of General Liao Yunzhou, the remaining ten divisions were completely annihilated. The encirclement and annihilation of this corps began on the 24th of last month and lasted a total of nineteen days. The annihilation of the Huang Wei Corps heralds that the Qiu Qingquan and Li Mi Corps led by Du Yuming northeast of Yongcheng will meet the same fate.
　　[Xinhua News Agency, Huaihai Front, 16th] The People's Liberation Army is continuing to tighten its encirclement of the Du Yuming bandit troops and has repelled several breakouts by the bandit army to the south. From the 12th to the 14th, the People's Liberation Army successively captured important strongholds held by the enemy, including Lishilin (west of Xiaoxian County) and Weizhuang, Miaozhuang, and Sun Pavilion to its southeast, Wulou, Yinzhuang, and Yingzhai to the southwest, and Wuzhuang and Yanglizhuang to the northeast. In the battle to capture Wuzhuang and Yanglizhuang on the evening of the 12th, the People's Liberation Army annihilated the 709th Regiment of the 237th Division of the enemy's 8th Army, the 117th Regiment of the 39th Division of the 40th Army, and an engineer company of that division. On the afternoon of the 13th, when two regiments of the enemy's 70th Army attempted to break out to the south, they were completely routed by our forces, and a large number of enemy soldiers were killed or wounded.

　　宿县西南围歼战胜利结束
  　黄维兵团全部覆灭
    我军继续紧缩围歼徐州逃敌
    【新华社淮海前线十六日急电】被围于宿县西南双堆集地区的国民党匪军黄维兵团残部，已于十五日晚十一时被全部歼灭。该敌于十五日黄昏开始向西突围，解放军当即予以阻击，战至晚十一时将突围之敌全部歼灭。战果正清查中。黄维兵团共辖四个军十一个师，十一月中旬由豫南增援徐蚌战场，行至宿县西南浍河南岸南平集地区，即被解放军全部包围。该兵团全部为蒋贼嫡系部队，其十八军（即原胡琏部整十一师）被称为蒋匪军五大主力之一。除其八十五军一一零师已于上月二十九日在师长廖运周将军率领下起义外，其余十个师全部被歼。对于该兵团的围歼战开始于上月二十四日，历时共十九日。黄维兵团的被歼灭，预告了永城东北杜聿明所率邱清泉、李强两兵团将遭遇同样命运。
    【新华社淮海前线十六日电】人民解放军正继续紧缩对杜聿明匪部的包围，并击退匪军数次向南的突围。十二日至十四日，解放军先后攻占敌困守的重要据点李石林（萧县以西）及其东南的魏楼、苗庄、孙阁，西南的吴楼、殷庄、营砦，东北的吴庄、杨李庄等据点多处。解放军十二日晚在攻占吴庄、杨李庄的战斗中，歼灭敌第八军二三七师之七零九团，四十军三十九师之一一七团及该师的一个工兵连。十三日下午敌七十军的两个团向南突围时，被我全部击溃，毙伤敌极多。
