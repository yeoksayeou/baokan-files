　　Rectifying Schools During Party Consolidation
  　Fangjiaying Runs a Good Primary School
    [Jinan News] Fangjiaying, with 535 households, is a small village in the Second District of Weixian County, Jinnan District. In Nantou Fangjiaying, there are 114 school-age children. After the spring plowing this year, the actual number of students attending school was 50 or 60. In Beitou Jiuxianying, there are 85 school-age children, but the actual number of students attending school is only 30 or 40. The reasons for the small number of children attending school and the lack of enthusiasm in running the schools are: 1. The village lacks fuel. Children generally have to go to the fields to collect firewood, dig thatch roots, or work in the fields. Girls spin cotton, weave cloth, and do odd jobs at home, leaving them no time to attend school. 2. The county and district lack planned organization and leadership in rural national education. Inspection and supervision are also insufficient. Village cultural and educational cadres can't resolve the firewood supply for teachers unless they repeatedly urge them, which greatly affects the teachers' lives. 3. Primary school teachers have low political and cultural levels and little teaching experience. Their teaching management and contact with students' families are also insufficient. Teachers' family economic burdens have not been adequately resolved, and their morale is low.
    In March of this year, the land reform work team arrived in Fangjiaying. From the beginning, they paid attention to primary school education. Initially, a comrade from the Party consolidation group helped rectify the primary school, and then another person was transferred to help with the rectification. They began by conducting a general understanding of the situation in the two primary schools in Nantou and Beitou. At the mass meeting of the combined villages of Nantou and Beitou on April 12, everyone unanimously agreed to merge the two schools into one and welcomed children from the neighboring village of "Simafang" to attend school as well. The children loved the excitement and automatically went to each house to mobilize their little friends to come to school and study together. After the district convened a joint conference of primary school teachers in the entire district in early May, educational cadres were reassigned, and a meeting of student parents was held to eliminate the estrangement between the school and student families. Teachers engaged in criticism and self-criticism, reviewed and summarized past teaching experiences, and established a leave system to overcome the past sloppy phenomenon of returning home for five or six days at a time. They effectively resolved the teachers' living difficulties, and the teachers were all encouraged to actively strengthen teaching preparation work, convene student cadres, discuss consolidating the Young Pioneer and student union organizations, improve cadres at all levels, refresh the school walls, post newly compiled slogans, establish small blackboard newspapers, report on learning attitudes, organize after-school singing, and invigorate recreational activities. In this way, the school was full of vitality, and the number of students attending school increased to 140 or 150. The atmosphere of learning gradually became tense and active. Children from families lacking labor adopted a method of half-day production and half-day schooling, which solved some difficulties. In early July, the county's Civil Education Section decided to establish a senior class based on the senior classes of Wangjialing Central Primary School and Fangjiaying Senior Primary School, enrolling more than 40 primary school graduates and out-of-school youth from nearby villages. It was also decided to change Fangjiaying Primary School into the Second District Complete Primary School, which was later changed to Weixian County No. 7 Complete Primary School in the fall. Currently, there are more than 80 students in the senior department's Classes A and B, and more than 200 students in the junior department, which merged with Simafang Primary School. With eight teachers, and with the active cooperation of all the school's staff and students and village cadres, the school's educational work is currently advancing by leaps and bounds. (Mei Nan)

　　整党中帮助整顿学校
  　方家营办好小学
    【冀南讯】全村五百三十五户的方家营，是冀南区威县二区一个小村镇。南头方家营学龄儿童一百十四名，今年春耕后，到校学生实数五、六十名，北头旧县营学龄儿童八十五名，平时实到学生只三、四十名。儿童上学人数稀少，和学校办得不起劲的原因是：一、村中缺乏燃料，一般儿童都须下地拾柴，挖茅草根，或到地里去干活。女孩则在家纺花织布，做零活，无暇上学。二、县区对农村国民教育工作缺乏有计划的组织和领导，检查督促也极不够，村里文教干部对于教员的柴火供给，非经轻再三催要不能解决，这对教员生活很有影响。三、小学教员的政治文化水平不高，教学经验也很少，在教学管理及和学生家庭联系上也做得不够；教员家庭经济负担，没有得到适当解决，情绪不高。
    今年三月间，土改工作团到了方家营。一开始就注意了小学教育工作。起先由整党小组一个同志帮助整顿小学，又另调人帮助整顿，开始对南北头两所小学情况，进行一般了解。在四月十二日南北合村的群众大会上，大家一致赞成南北头两校合并成为一校，并欢迎邻村“四马坊”学童也来上学。儿童们喜欢热闹，自动分头到各家去动员他们的小伙伴一起到校学习。五月初区上召开全区小学教员联席会议后，重新配备教育干部，召开学生家长会议，消除学校和学生家庭间的隔阂，教员展开批评和自我批评，检讨总结过去教学经验，并建立请假制度，克服过去一回家五、六天的散漫现象，切实解决教员生活困难，教员都鼓起劲来，积极加强教学准备工作，召集学生干部，商量整顿儿童团和学生会组织，改进各级干部，刷新校舍墙壁，张贴新编标语，建立小黑板报，报导学习态度，组织课余游唱；活跃文娱生活。这样，学校生气蓬勃，到校学生增至一百四、五十人，学习空气，逐渐紧张活跃起来。家里缺少劳动力的儿童，采取半天生产半天上学的办法，解决了部分困难。七月初县民教科决定以该区王家陵中心小学高级班和方家营高级班为基础，招收附近各村小学毕业生及失学青年共四十余名，成立高级班；并决定将方家营小学改为二区完全小学，秋后又改成威县县立第七完全小学。现高级部甲乙两班共八十余人，初级部合并四马坊小学共二百多人，教员八人，在全校员生和村干积极合作下，目前该校教育工作，正在大踏步前进。（梅南）
