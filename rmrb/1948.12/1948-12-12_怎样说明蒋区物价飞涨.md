To the Editor:

I saw two price comparisons published on page two of the November 2nd People's Daily, and there are many things I don't understand. For example, the price change table of the puppet Gold Yuan Certificates in Tianjin from August 19th to October 13th. I only know that prices have risen very sharply, but why are the prices so low? I can't figure it out myself. Some comrades asked: How can the grain in Tianjin be so cheap and still be said to have risen? Look at the price of millet in Tianjin at 1.5 jiao per jin, rice at 2.2 jiao per jin, and wheat at 1.7 jiao per jin. An old man in the city said: The grain in Tianjin has risen, but it is not as expensive as in our place. Because I don't understand it myself, I can't explain it to the masses. I don't know what the puppet Gold Yuan Certificates are either. Please, Editor, take the time to explain it so that I can explain and promote it to the masses.

Answer: The "Gold Yuan Certificate" is a tool used by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits to save their serious economic crisis and plunder the people's wealth. "It is replacing one piece of waste paper (referring to 'Legal Tender') with another piece of waste paper (referring to 'Gold Yuan Certificate')."

On August 19th this year, because the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang saw that they were about to collapse on the one hand, and the "Legal Tender" was depreciating day by day on the other hand, at that time the price of millet in Tianjin was more than 400,000 yuan per jin, and wheat was more than 500,000 yuan per jin. Thus, they announced the issuance of "Gold Yuan Certificates" from August 19th, stipulating that each "Gold Yuan Certificate" could be exchanged for 3 million "Legal Tender". In other words, 3 million yuan saved in the past now becomes one yuan. It also stipulated that gold, silver, silver dollars, and foreign currencies should be turned over to the "state". If ordinary people had these things, they would be considered to have committed a crime and would be confiscated.

Because the Chiang bandits turned 3 million yuan of "Legal Tender" into one yuan of "Gold Yuan Certificate", the prices in the enemy-occupied areas seem relatively lower on the surface. For example, on August 19th, one jin of millet in Tianjin cost 1.5 jiao to buy with "Gold Yuan Certificates" (but if converted into "Legal Tender", it was still 450,000 yuan). This price reduction is not a real price reduction, but an artificially created numerical reduction. This is precisely a clever and vicious method used by the Kuomintang reactionaries to defraud the people of their wealth.

While announcing the "currency reform", the Chiang controlled areas also dispatched a large number of "police," "military police," secret agents, and lackeys, in an attempt to maintain the credit of the "Gold Yuan Certificate" by force, freezing prices at the level of August 19th. However, the result of relying on guns to plunder and the "price limit" policy could only be soaring prices, capital flight, market stagnation, black market prevalence, factory shutdowns and production cuts, and worker unemployment. Since the panic buying in early October spread throughout major cities, shops closed, and the grain shortage became serious. Anti-hunger strikes, strikes, teacher strikes, and student strikes broke out everywhere, like wildfire, and the entire Chiang controlled area was in chaos. The price of millet in Tianjin rose from 1.5 jiao per jin on August 19th to 1.6 yuan. Corn also rose from 1 jiao per jin to 1.1 yuan. That is to say, if an ordinary person had one yuan of fake "Gold Yuan Certificate", he could initially buy ten jin of corn, but in less than two months he could not even buy one jin of corn. In Shanghai, the economic center of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, this situation was even more serious. On November 6th, following the panic buying in October, there was another rice grab. People fought over rice at the Tongxing Rice Store, and bricks and tiles flew, scattering rice all over the street. By the 8th, food rice was even more scarce, and prices rose wildly. The retail price in the morning was double that of the 6th. At the same time, panic buying everywhere was unprecedentedly fierce. Prices soared, breaking the previous precedent in Chinese currency history. For example, the market price of rice in the morning was 300 yuan per dan, but there were offers but no sellers. Outside the market, people shouted 600 yuan, but it was still difficult to buy. At noon, it rose to 1,000 yuan per dan, and in the afternoon, it was even higher at 1,400 yuan, but there were still no transactions. By the evening, it had soared to 1,800 yuan. The price of rice rose fivefold that day.

At the beginning of the "currency reform," the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang also stubbornly said: "Only success is allowed, failure is not allowed." However, in less than eighty-five days, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits had to declare their "currency reform" a "complete failure." On November 12th, they announced the so-called "revision of the 'Gold Yuan Certificate' issuance method" and "handling method for gold, silver, and foreign currencies." This is still a new trick played under the old conspiracy of great fraud and plunder. This new trick first changed the method of "price limit" plunder. Secondly, the statutory gold content of each "Gold Yuan Certificate" was reduced from 0.22217 grams to 0.044434 grams. At the same time, after the Chiang Kai-shek bandits plundered the people's gold, silver, and foreign currencies at low prices, the exchange rate of the "Gold Yuan Certificate" against gold, silver, and U.S. dollars was changed. The price of gold rose from 200 yuan to 1,000 yuan per tael, the price of silver rose from 3 yuan to 15 yuan per tael, the price of silver coins rose from 2 yuan to 10 yuan per yuan, and the price of U.S. dollars rose from 4 yuan to 20 yuan per dollar. That is to say, the "Gold Yuan Certificate" was automatically devalued by 80%, and the price of gold, silver, and foreign currencies was increased by four times. But he was still insatiably trying to continue to plunder the people's gold, silver, and foreign currencies with a piece of paper. Another important trick was to cancel the issuance limit of 2 billion "Gold Yuan Certificates," which was announced at the beginning of the "currency reform" and was ten times higher than the total amount of Legal Tender in circulation. In other words, the issuance of "Gold Yuan Certificates" in the future will be even more unlimited. Because the Chiang Kai-shek bandits' huge fiscal deficit completely relies on issuance to make up for it, the greater malignant inflation and drastic devaluation of the "Gold Yuan Certificate" in the future is destined and unchangeable. Therefore, under the rule of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, industry and commerce will collapse, capital will flee, production will shrink, and farms will go bankrupt. No matter what kind of "gold yuan" or "Gold Yuan Certificate," they cannot avoid the rapid collapse of the economic lifeline of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits.

The prices in our liberated areas, on the other hand, have remained basically stable for a long time. For example, the price of millet in Shijiazhuang in late August was 350 yuan per jin, and in mid-October it was 335 yuan. The price of corn in late August was 275 yuan per jin, and in mid-October it was 225 yuan. Although the prices of other goods fluctuated, the amounts were very small and could not be compared with those in the Kuomintang controlled areas.

    怎样说明蒋区物价飞涨
    编辑同志：
    我看到十一月二号人民日报第二版上登载的两种物价对比，有好多地方闹不清楚。如天津八月十九日至十月十三日，伪金元券的物价变化表，我看了光知道物价上涨的很厉害，但是这个价钱为啥这样低呢？我自己弄不清楚。有的同志问：怎么天津粮食这样贱，还说上涨了？你看天津小米每市斤一角五分，大米二角二分，小麦市斤一角七分。城内一个老头说：天津粮食涨了，还没咱这个地方贵哩。因我自己弄不明白，也无法给群众解释。那伪金元券我也不知道是啥？请编辑同志费心给解答一下，以便好给群众解释宣传。

    答：“金元券”是蒋匪为了挽救其严重的经济危机，与掳夺人民财富的一种工具，“是用一张废纸（指‘金元券’）代替了另一张废纸（指‘法币’）”。
    今年八月十九日，因蒋介石匪帮一方面看到自己快要垮台了，另一方面“法币”也一天天的贬值，那时天津小米每斤达四十余万元，小麦每斤五十余万元，于是便宣布从八月十九日起发行“金元券”，并规定“金元券”每元换“法币”三百万元，也就是说，过去存三百万元的现在变成了一元，还规定了黄金、白银、银元、外国货币收归“国有”，老百姓如果存有这些东西就算犯法，就被没收。
    因为蒋匪把三百万元“法币”变成了一元“金元券”，因而从表面看来，敌区物价是相对的降低了，如八月十九日天津小米每斤用“金元券”买是一角五分（但若合成“法币”仍为四十五万元）。而这种物价的降低，并不是真正的物价降低；而是一种人工制造的数额减小。这也正是国民党反动集团为了骗取人民财富的一个巧妙而毒辣的办法。
    蒋区在宣布“币制改革”的同时并出动大批的“警察”、“宪兵”、特务、狗腿，曾企图以暴力维持“金元券”的信用，将物价冻结在八月十九日的水平。但依靠枪杆进行掠夺与“限价”政策的结果只能是物价狂涨，资金逃避，市场停滞，黑市流行，工厂停工减产，工人失业。自十月初抢购风潮更弥漫于各大城市，商店关门，粮荒严重。各地反饥饿、罢工、罢教、罢课，如野火燎原，整个蒋区呈现了一片混乱现象。天津的小米由八月十九日每斤一角五分，涨到一元六角。玉米也由每斤一角涨到一元一角。也就是说：一个老百姓若存有一元伪“金元券”，起初可买玉米十斤，但不到两个月的时间就连一斤玉米也买不到了。而在蒋匪经济重心的上海，这种局面更为严重，十一月六日继十月份抢购风潮之后，又发生抢米骚动，同兴米店争购得砖瓦横飞，洒得满街是米。至八日食米愈显缺乏，价格疯狂上涨，早晨零售价即较六日上升一倍。同时各处抢购亦空前炽烈。物价狂跳，打破中国通货史之前例。如市场米价上午为每担三百元，有行无市，市外则高喊六百元，亦难买到。中午即涨到每担一千元，到下午更高喊一千四百元，仍无成交，到傍晚竟涨到一千八百元，当日米价竟上升五倍。
    蒋介石匪帮在“币改”之初，也曾硬着头皮说：“只许成功，不许失败”。可是这句话，不到八十五天的时间，蒋匪便不得不宣告他的“币制改革”“全盘破产”。于十一月十二日宣布所谓“修正‘金元券’发行办法”与“金银外币处理办法”。这依然是在旧的大骗局与大掠夺的阴谋之下，又耍了一个新的花样。这个新花样首先就改变了“限价”掠夺的办法。其次是将“金元券”每元法定含金量由○．二二二一七公分减至○．○四四四三四公分，同时在蒋匪以贱价掠夺了人民的金银外币之后，改变了“金元券”对金银美钞的兑换率。黄金每两由二百元涨至一千元，白银每两由三元涨至十五元，银币由每元兑二元涨至十元，美钞由每元四元涨至二十元。这就是说：将“金元券”自动的贬值了百分之八十，将金银外币价格提高了四倍。但他还是贪而无厌的企图继续以一张纸来掠夺人民的金银外币。再一个重要的花样就是将“币制改革”开始时宣布的、比法币总发行额高十倍的“金元券”发行限额二十亿取消了。也就是说：今后的“金元券”发行，将更无限制。由于蒋匪庞大的财政赤字完全依赖发行来弥补，故“金元券”今后更大的恶性膨胀猛烈贬值，是注定不移的了。因此蒋介石匪帮统治下的工商业倒闭，资金外逃，生产萎缩，农庄破产，无论什么样的“金元”与“金元券”都无法避免蒋介石匪帮的经济命脉的迅速走上崩溃的道路。
    而我们解放区物价，从很长时期来看，基本上保持了平稳状态。如石家庄八月下旬小米每斤三百五十元，到十月中旬为三百三十五元，玉米在八日下旬每斤二百七十五元，到十月中旬为二百廿五元。其他各物虽各有涨落，但为数都很低微，和国民党统治地区是完全不能比拟的。（华北贸易总公司商情科）
