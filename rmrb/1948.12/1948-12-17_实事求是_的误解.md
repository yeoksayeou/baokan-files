　　Misunderstanding of "Seeking Truth from Facts"
    Ding Yi
    Some frequently spoken phrases originally have very profound meanings. However, precisely because they are frequently spoken, both the speaker and the listener often become somewhat vague about these profound meanings, even falling into old concepts and misunderstanding them. "Seeking Truth from Facts" is one such example.
    The phrase "Seeking Truth from Facts" first appeared in the "Book of Han, Biography of King Xian of Hejian," but its widespread use seems to have originated with the Han scholars of the Qing Dynasty. They applied it to academic research. Targeting the empty and impractical tendencies of the late Neo-Confucianism of the Song and Yuan dynasties, they put forward the slogan "Seeking Truth from Facts," using "facts" to counter "emptiness," emphasizing the "facts." Thus, everything had to be verified by facts. They refused to talk about anything without factual verification. They believed that this "factual verification" was the "facts," and only by seeking conclusions from many "factual verifications" could one arrive at the "truth."
    This was their understanding of "Seeking Truth from Facts." The emphasis on factual verification was a positive aspect of this understanding, so their academic research did yield some achievements, such as verifying the authenticity of some ancient books, etc. However, this understanding was too superficial, so the achievements were limited to this. Moreover, a larger problem emerged. They only focused on the details of "facts" and "events," neglecting the more important aspect of these "facts" and "events," failing to consider the time, environment, and conditions under which these "facts" and "events" occurred. As a result, these "facts" and "events" were isolated and became immutable. Therefore, their interpretation of history was merely a listing of factual verifications, unable to see through these factual verifications to grasp the reality of history. And the factual verifications seemed almost the same, so they became proponents of historical cycles. Furthermore, when they encountered concrete events in actual life, things got even worse. Regardless of the time, environment, and conditions of the event, they simply compared today's phenomena with past phenomena. If they found similarities, they considered it "factual verification" and applied the old solution directly, considering the matter settled. This, in their view, was the spirit of "Seeking Truth from Facts," but they did not realize that they had fallen into the quagmire of empiricism, completely contrary to the true meaning of "Seeking Truth from Facts."
    There is a well-known story: A person was resting under a tree by the roadside when a rabbit came running from a distance. It was running too fast and accidentally bumped into the tree root, fainting and dying. The person happily took the rabbit home. He had obtained this "factual verification," so he spent his days sitting under the tree, waiting for rabbits to come and die by hitting the tree. This story is called "Waiting for a Rabbit by a Stump." It seems like a joke, but it is a good portrayal of the kind of person mentioned above.
    This kind of "Seeking Truth from Facts" method of "waiting for a rabbit by a stump," a national essence, later combined with John Dewey's theory of pragmatism and became the "experimentalism" of people like Hu Shih. They constantly said "bring evidence" and acted according to experience. They also waved the banner of "Seeking Truth from Facts." At first glance, it seemed that they were indeed seeking truth from facts, but upon further reflection, if you exposed it, it was still just shallow and laughable empiricism of "waiting for a rabbit by a stump." How could there be any real spirit of Seeking Truth from Facts?
    Seeking Truth from Facts is not empiricism, but rather the opposite. However, the two are easily confused. The reason, I think, is probably that this kind of "waiting for a rabbit by a stump" theory is at play.
    Having clarified the past misunderstanding of "Seeking Truth from Facts," what is the true meaning of "Seeking Truth from Facts"?
    Simply put, "facts" include three aspects – the event happening at this time, in this place, and under these conditions. Carefully studying and analyzing based on these three aspects is "seeking." The conclusion drawn from this careful study and analysis is the "truth." The literal explanation of "Seeking Truth from Facts" is just that. However, it should be noted that time, place, and conditions are constantly changing. The same thing happening at different times, in different places, and under different conditions, its nature is very different and cannot be solved in the same way. If you insist on applying the same solution, it becomes empiricism and is not "factual." If it is not "factual," and you still want to "seek," then you are splitting hairs and will never find the "truth." Naturally, summarizing the experience of past similar events as a reference lesson is still necessary, but this is only a reference lesson. It is by no means asking you to apply it rigidly. There is a big difference between the two.
    This is the true meaning of "Seeking Truth from Facts."
    Originally, the great principles of the world, although profound in meaning, are also very easy to understand. If they were not very easy to understand, how could they gain the faith and support of the vast majority of people? But precisely because they are very easy to understand, some people seek them too deeply and often easily become confused, and this confusion leads to misunderstanding, and this misunderstanding is contrary to the original intention. "Seeking Truth from Facts" is just one example.

### “实事求是”的误解

　　“实事求是”的误解
    丁易
    有些口头常说的话语，含义本来是很精湛的，但也正由于口头常说的关系、说的人听的人对这湛精的含义往往不免就有些模糊，甚至陷入旧的观念中而发生误解，比如“实事求是”就是。
    “实事求是”这句话的开始见于汉书河间兽王传，但普遍的应用仿佛是清代的汉学家们，他们是应用在研究学术上的。他们针对着宋元以来理学末流的空疏，提出“实事求是”的口号，以“实”来对“空”，着重的是在这个“实”字，于是一切便都要实证，没有实证，便不肯谈，他们认为这“实证”就是“事”，从许多“实证”中求得结论，才是“是”。
    他们是这样理解“实事求是”的，注重实证是这理解好的一面，所以他们研究学术，也还有些成绩，比如考订出一些古书真伪等等，但这理解却实在太表面了，所以成绩也就止于此，而更大的毛病也就跟着出来，他们只枝枝节节地着重“实”和“事”，却忽略了这“实”和“事”更重要的一面，没有顾及这“实”这“事”是在什么时间、环境、条件之下发生的，结果是将这“实”这“事”孤立了起来，成为一成不变的东西，所以他们解释历史，只是一些现象实证的罗列，不能透过这些现象实证看出历史的真实来，而现象实证又仿佛是差不多的，于是便变成了历史循环论者，再等到一接触实际生活中的具体事件上，那就更糟了，也不管事件发生的时间、环境、条件如何，只是一味的将今天的现象和过去的现象对照一番，觉得相同，便算“实证”，兜头一套，完事大吉。这在他们仿佛就是“实事求是”的精神，但却不知道这已经陷入了经验主义的泥沼，和“实事求是”的真意完全背道而驰了。
    有一个大家都知道的故事：说是一个人坐在路旁的树下休息，远处窜来一只兔子，跑得太快，不小心，撞着树根，便晕死了，这人很高兴地提着兔子回家，他得到了这一“实证”，于是便成天地坐在那树下等待兔子来撞死。这故事叫做“守株待兔”。看起来似乎是个笑话，但却是上面说的那一种人的很好的画像。
    这种国粹的守株待兔的“实事求是”的方法，到后来和美国杜威的理论结合起来，便成为胡适之之流的“实验主义”，开口闭口都是“拿证据来”，一举一动都要根据经验。他们也打着“实事求是”的幌子，乍一看来，也好象是在实事求是，但再想一想，把它戳穿，仍只不过是“守株待兔”的浅薄可笑的经验主义而已。何尝有一点真的实事求是的精神？
    实事求是不是经验主义，并且还是相反的东西，然而二者之间却又极容易混淆，这原因，我想恐怕就是这种“守株待兔”式的理论在作怪。
    弄清楚了过去对“实事求是”的误解，那么“实事求是”的真意又是怎样呢？
    简单说来，“实事”是包括三个方面的——便是此时、此地、此条件下发生的事，根据这三方面去仔细研究分析，这便是“求”，经过这仔细研究分析所得出的结论，这才是“是”。“实事求是”的字面解释就是如此。不过这里应该注意的就是时、地、条件是不断变化的，同样的事发生在不同的时、地、条件之下，它的性质便大不相同，便不能同样地去解决，假如硬要同样的去套，那就成了经验主义，便不是“实事”，不是“实事”，而还要去“求”，那便是钻牛角尖，永远也不会求出“是”来。自然，把过去同样的事的经验总结作为参考教训，仍是必要的，但这只是参考教训而已。决不是叫你去硬套，这之间是有着很大的分别的。
    这就是“实事求是”的真意义。
    本来天下大道至理含义虽然精湛，但也顶容易明白，假如不是顶容易明白，如何会得到最大多数人的信仰和拥护？但也正由于它顶容易明白，有些人求之过深，往往也就容易混淆，由混淆而误解，由误解而和本意相反，“实事求是”不过是其中一例而已。
