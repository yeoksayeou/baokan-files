[Hebei Central Telegram] Under the influence of the victorious situation of our People's Liberation Army on all fronts, the morale of the Kuomintang army in the Tianjin-Beijing area and north of the Daqing River is declining daily. In November, a total of more than 2,100 people surrendered or deserted. Among them, in addition to Zhu Zhankui, the commissioner of the puppet Hebei Province's Third District, leading more than 1,500 troops to surrender to our army on November 20, more and more soldiers are deserting in groups of three to five or individually. The "Kuomintang Army Veterans Reception Center" in the Tenth Military Subdistrict of Hebei Central alone received 608 Kuomintang officers and soldiers who surrendered or deserted in November. Although bandit Fu Zuoyi and bandit Wang Fenggang are trying every possible means to threaten and deceive soldiers to work for them, under the influence of the great victory of the People's Liberation Army's Autumn Offensive and the appeal of the lenient policy, Chiang Kai-shek's soldiers no longer believe their officers' deceptions. On the 19th of last month, when the 5th Company of the 66th Regiment of the 22nd Division of Chiang Kai-shek's 16th Army was stationed in Beihe, Gao Fuyou, the deputy squad leader of the company, and four others escaped together while on sentry duty. When the Chiang Kai-shek bandits of the 128th Regiment of the 43rd Division of the 94th Army in Gucheng fled north on the 21st of last month, Wang Jinshan and Han Enxu, soldiers of the 1st Company of the 1st Battalion of the regiment, were driving two rubber-wheeled carts. Because the carts broke down and they could not move, the platoon leader told them to go to Xiaojinzhuang in Dingxing to repair them. They took the opportunity to leave the team and hid in a reed pond. Several hours later, the People's Liberation Army came, and they handed over the livestock and carts to the People's Liberation Army.
    
[Hebei Central, 9th] Militias from Rongding (newly established county) and other counties in the Tenth Military Subdistrict of Hebei Central, while blocking Fu bandit troops attempting to invade Shijiazhuang from Beijing and fleeing north from Baoding, launched extensive explosive operations along the Ping-Bao line. From the end of October to November 23, they killed or wounded more than 90 Fu bandit soldiers, captured three enemy soldiers, destroyed five enemy vehicles, killed ten enemy warhorses, and captured one enemy vehicle loaded with ammunition, containing more than 40 boxes of shells and bullets, four large carts loaded with supplies, and some other supplies.

[North Yue Telegram] In September and October, in order to protect the autumn harvest and autumn tax collection in the edge areas of Fangshan, Laiyuan, Zhuozhou, and Liangxiang, a certain unit of our Pingxi forces carried out continuous activities deep behind enemy lines to find opportunities to attack the enemy who came out to rob grain. First, in the battle of Ganchi (Sixth District of Fangshan), a whole company of puppet bandits was wiped out. Then, in Xiaxindian and other places, the task of protecting the autumn harvest and collecting grain was successfully completed. The total results of these two months are as follows: 16 battles were fought, killing or wounding 190 enemy soldiers below the rank of deputy battalion commander, capturing alive 179 enemy soldiers below the rank of deputy battalion commander, seizing two 60mm mortars, eight light machine guns, 120 rifles and carbines, one submachine gun, seven pistols, 155 hand grenades, 50 various shells, 9,564 various bullets, 36 bayonets, one telescope, three telephones, three bicycles, destroying eight large and small enemy bunkers, and recovering 8,523 catties of electric wire.
