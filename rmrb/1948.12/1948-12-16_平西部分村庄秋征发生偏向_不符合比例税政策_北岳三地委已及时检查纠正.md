[North Yue Telegraph] Most of the mountainous areas of western Pingxi are old and semi-old areas. This year, the agricultural proportional tax system was implemented, and collection was carried out according to the new agricultural tax regulations. In order to ensure that the burden on the masses is fair and reasonable, the Commissioner's Office arranged for each county to conduct typical investigations in advance and sent work teams to the countryside to help. Through the efforts of cadres at all levels, certain achievements have been made; however, because the work was not thorough enough, and the masses did not fully understand the spirit of the new tax regulations, the following deviations occurred during the autumn grain collection:

　　(1) Some villages violated the agricultural proportional tax policy in the assessment and collection of taxes: For example, in seven villages including Dahe Nan in the Second District of Laishui, more than 160 mu of fallow land was assessed for yield, and all draught animals were not deducted for consumption. The truly poor families of revolutionary martyrs and disabled soldiers, and the orphaned and widowed without labor, were not appropriately raised to the tax exemption point as stipulated in the tax regulations, resulting in some families of revolutionary martyrs and disabled soldiers having nothing to eat after paying the public grain, and some villages not even having enough to pay taxes. In individual villages in Huailai, draught animals were also not deducted for consumption as stipulated in the tax regulations. In commercial collection, the commercial collection policy was violated. For example, Songlin Store in Laizhuo converted commerce into land acreage based on the size of the business and merged it with the agricultural tax for collection. Yangfang Village in Changwan called on industrial and commercial households to report and discuss publicly. Some villages stipulated that livestock for transportation and sales should bear 20 jin of public grain, and each merchant should bear 50 jin. In Caoyaozi Village, Huailai, water mills and water grinders were also converted into land acreage for calculation and burden. Each millstone converted the annual income into 24 mu of land, and each mu was stipulated to have a yield of three dan for collection.

　　(2) Uneven burden: Some villages collectively concealed land and underreported yields. In Pian Shang Village, Second District of Fangshan, the village cadres initially only reported more than eight qing of land and 135,000 persimmons. Later, after holding branch meetings and representative meetings, and after ideological mobilization, they admitted to more than 13 qing of land and 180,000 persimmons. In order to reduce the burden, Jiudu Village deliberately lowered the yield and reduced the burden area. Their method was: dividing the land into three grades. The first-grade land actually yielded one dan, eight or nine dou, but only reported one dan and two dou; the second-grade land actually yielded one dan and four dou, but only reported nine dou; the third-grade land actually yielded eight or nine dou, but only reported five dou. As a result, the entire village had no burden mu except for tax-exempt mu. However, some cadres, in order to prevent village-levelism, forcibly increased the yield, resulting in an extremely uneven burden between villages. For example, Qingshui burdened 46 jin per mu, while Gongjianpu burdened only 8 jin per mu.

　　In order to correctly implement the agricultural tax regulations, the Prefectural Committee held a joint county secretary meeting on November 13th, and first examined the main reasons for the deviations: 1. Party committees at all levels did not pay enough attention to agricultural tax, lacked specific leadership and timely inspection, and did not mobilize the strength of the entire party to do this work, relying solely on financial and grain cadres. 2. All cadres were not well organized to study and research the agricultural tax policy, and they acted blindly, so that cadres could not adapt when encountering specific problems. 3. Extensive and in-depth publicity was not carried out among the masses, the village cadres' thinking was not clarified, the masses did not understand the situation, and the backbone role of party members and better elements was not brought into play, resulting in serious localism.

　　In order to correct the deviations that occurred, the Third Prefectural Committee put forward the following specific suggestions: (1) Cadres should universally study the new tax regulations, convene representative meetings to explain the burden methods, so that the broad masses understand the policy, cadres and party members take the lead in filling out truthfully, and the county secretaries or county heads must personally lead a village to create experience to guide the overall situation, and thoroughly correct all deviations from the policy in the collection of each village. (2) Conduct in-depth investigation and research, first find out the standard mu of land, determine the yield, and then convene a representative meeting to evaluate the yield compared to the land quality, so as to achieve a balance of burden between villages and between households. (3) Those who conceal land yield should be combined with the issuance of land certificates to conduct a thorough investigation and registration. (4) Fallow land that could not be cultivated before the land reform and was abandoned shall not be taxed. Land distributed in the land reform that was abandoned and not cultivated for various reasons shall be reduced or exempted from taxation as appropriate. However, the land should be registered, and the households with wasteland should be given appropriate education to encourage them to cultivate diligently in the future and not allow further abandonment, otherwise, it will not be exempted from taxation. (5) Those who seize and plant wasteland (regardless of whether they are from this village or other villages), those who have been clearly announced by the government to be exempt from taxation for cultivation shall be exempt from taxation. Those who have not been announced shall be taxed appropriately within the general burden. (6) For households who have fled and returned home, in addition to the tax exemption point, the tax regulations stipulate that if they are at home for three months, the tax exemption point will be deducted, which refers to the general situation. From a policy perspective, households who have fled are not leaving their hometown for no reason. In order to strive for their return to production in large numbers, it is more reasonable to deduct the tax exemption point.

### 平西部分村庄秋征发生偏向　不符合比例税政策  北岳三地委已及时检查纠正

　　平西部分村庄秋征发生偏向
  　不符合比例税政策
    北岳三地委已及时检查纠正
    【北岳电】平西山地大部是老区半老区，今年实行了农业比例税收制度，按新农业税则进行征收。为作到群众负担公平合理，专署事先布置各县进行典型调查，分区派工作组下乡帮助，经过各级干部的努力，已获得一定成绩；但因工作还不够深入，群众了解新税则的精神不足，在秋征中发生了以下偏向：
    （一）部分村庄在征收订税中违背了农业比例税政策：如涞水二区大河南等七个村把一百六十多亩轮荒地订了产量，所有耕畜均没有除消耗，对真正的贫困烈军工属和无劳力的孤寡没有按税则规定适当的提高免税点，致使一些烈军工属交了公粮就没得吃，有的村烈军工属甚至不够纳税。怀来个别村庄耕畜也没有按税则规定除消耗。在商业征收上违犯了商业征收政策，如涞涿松林店把商业按经营规模大小折成地亩与农业税合并征收。昌宛羊坊村叫工商业户自报公议，有的村规定运销的牲口负担公粮二十斤，每一商人负担五十斤。怀来曹窑子村水碾、水磨也折合地亩计算负担，每盘碾磨将全年收入折成二十四亩地，每亩规定产量三石进行征收。
    （二）负担不平衡：有些村庄集体隐瞒土地，瞒报产量。房山二区片上村，开始村干只报了八顷多地，十三万五千个柿子，后召开支部会、代表会，经过思想动员，才承认出十三顷多地，十八万个柿子。九渡村为少负担，故意降低产量，缩小了负担面积。他们的办法是：将地分为三等，一等地实产一石八九斗，只报一石二斗；二等地实产一石四斗，只报九斗；三等地实产八九斗，只报五斗。结果全村除了免税亩，则一个负担亩也没有了。可是有些干部为防止村本位，硬提高产量，又造成了村与村负担上极不平衡。如清水每亩负担四十六斤，公涧铺每亩仅负担八斤。
    为了正确执行农业税则，地委于十一月十三日召开了县书联席会议，首先检查发生偏向的主要原因：一、各级党委对农业税不够重视，缺乏具体领导和及时检查，没有动员起全党力量来作这一工作，单靠财粮干部去作。二、没有很好的组织全体干部学习和研究农业税政策，盲目的去作，致使干部遇到具体问题便无法适从。三、在群众中没有进行广泛深入的宣传，村干思想未搞通，群众不摸底，更没有发挥党员和较好分子的骨干作用，因而严重的产生了本位主义思想。
    为纠正发生的偏向，三地委提出以下几个具体意见：（一）干部普遍学习新税则，召开代表会讲解负担方法，使广大群众了解政策，干部党员带头认真填报，各县书或县长必须亲自领导一个村作出经验，指导全盘，彻底纠正各村征收中违背政策的各种偏向。（二）深入调查研究，首先找出土地标准亩，订出产量，然后再召开代表会评产量比地质，达到村与村、户与户的负担平衡。（三）隐瞒土地产量者，要结合发土地证，认真清查登记。（四）轮荒地凡在土改前因不能种而荒的不征税。在土改中分配之土地，因种种原因荒掉未种者，酌情减征或免征。但土地应加登记，并给予荒地户适当教育，促使今后应勤劳耕种，不准再荒，否则亦不免税。（五）抢种荒地者（不分本村或外村），经政府明令宣布耕种免税者，一律免税，未宣布者，在不超过一般负担量，应酌情征税。（六）逃亡户回家后除免税点，税则上规定在家三个月，扣除免税点，是指一般情况，从政策上来看，逃亡户并不是无故离家乡的，为了大量争取其回家生产，均除免税点才较合理。
