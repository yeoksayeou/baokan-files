　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th. The Dutch imperialists' negotiations with the Indonesian reactionary government, which had been dragging on for half a month, concluded on December 11th after the Dutch government simultaneously issued communiqués in The Hague and Batavia. These Dutch-Indonesian negotiations had been brewing for a long time. As early as the end of October, Dutch Foreign Minister Stikker went to Indonesia to discuss with the Hatta government how to organize a puppet United States of Indonesia Provisional Federal Government. At that time, he reached some tacit understanding with Hatta. After Stikker flew back to the Netherlands on November 13th, the Dutch government issued a communiqué on the 16th stating that an agreement had been reached. On the 17th, Hatta shamelessly asked the Indonesian people to trust the Dutch government's "good intentions" in a radio broadcast. On the 24th, a special Dutch cabinet mission headed by Stikker, including Dutch Overseas Colonial Minister Sasseen and Dutch King's special envoy Niehe, arrived in Batavia and resumed negotiations with the Indonesian Republic delegation led by Sjahrir at Kaliurang near Yogyakarta, under the auspices of the United Nations "mediation" committee. The progress of the meeting was kept secret. On the 7th of this month, the Dutch cabinet mission suddenly returned home from Batavia, and the negotiations broke down without an agreement. Regarding the reasons for the failure to reach an agreement in the negotiations, Agence France-Presse's 5th dispatch quoted a Batavia observer as saying: This was because the Netherlands demanded that the Dutch High Commissioner in Indonesia be given the power of veto and the power to use armed forces without the prior approval of the Provisional Federal Government.
    American imperialism is the string-puller behind these Dutch-Indonesian negotiations. "When Stikker visited Washington in October, Marshall hinted that the United States hoped that the long stalemate could finally be resolved." (US Information Service, Washington, November 26th) When these Dutch-Indonesian negotiations were underway, the American representative of the United Nations "mediation" committee, Cochran, worked hard until the last minute. The purpose of the United States' urgent attempt to resolve the Dutch-Indonesian stalemate is nothing more than to unite the Dutch and Indonesian reactionaries, strengthen the suppression of the Indonesian people and the Communist Party, so as to facilitate the penetration of American aggression forces into Indonesia, and strengthen the plunder of the Indonesian people. To this end, the United States has used loans as bait to lure Hatta into further submission and surrender. According to a Telecommunications Agency report from Singapore on November 24th: The conditions for the United States to grant Indonesia a loan were conveyed to Hatta by Stikker, the content of which was first and foremost to eliminate the Indonesian Communist Party and establish a new federation with solid ties to the Netherlands. Washington Post reporter Cohen openly stated in a report on Washington's hope that the Netherlands and the Indonesian Republic could resolve their deadlock: If this hope is realized, it will open up a large amount of rubber, sugar, coconut and other raw materials needed for "world recovery". On the other hand, since the Madiun Incident, the Hatta government has been faithfully fulfilling the conditions of the United States. The prisons of Yogyakarta and Solo are already filled with Indonesian patriots. After the breakdown of the Dutch-Indonesian Kaliurang negotiations, Hatta still rushed from Yogyakarta to Batavia on the 5th, attempting to reach a final agreement.
    However, this act of betraying the motherland by the Indonesian reactionary government has been opposed by the Indonesian people. When the Dutch-Indonesian negotiations were underway, the Indonesian people always insisted on independence and did not relax their struggle against Dutch imperialism. According to a TASS report on the 7th quoting the Indonesian News Agency: "The central leading organ of the Indonesian trade union in Yogyakarta passed a resolution, pointing out that the Indonesian trade union will reject any agreement that may harm the sovereignty of the Republic." According to an Associated Press report from The Hague on the 8th: Dutch military sources from Batavia showed that 307 incidents occurred in the Dutch-controlled areas in the past week, which is the highest number of conflicts in a week since the Renville Agreement last winter. The strong will of the broad masses of the Indonesian people against imperialism and against national betrayal forced the capitulationist Hatta to be somewhat cautious when finally accepting the harsh conditions of Dutch imperialism.

　　美帝操纵荷印谈判
    遭到印尼人民反抗
    【新华社陕北十六日电】拖延半月之久的荷兰帝国主义者与印尼反动政府之间的谈判，已于十二月十一日荷兰政府在海牙与巴达维亚两地同时发表公报后，宣告结束。此次荷印谈判，酝酿已久。早在十月末，荷兰外长斯蒂克即赴印尼，与哈达政府方面磋商如何组织傀儡的印尼合众国临时联邦政府问题，当时，曾与哈达获得某种默契。十一月十三日，斯蒂克飞返荷兰后，荷兰政府即于十六日发表公报称：协议业已达成。十七日，哈达在广播中无耻地要求印尼人民对荷兰政府的“好意”表示信任。二十四日，以斯蒂克为首、有荷兰海外殖民部长沙逊及荷王专使尼赫尔等参加的荷兰内阁特别使团，抵达巴达维亚，在联合国“调处”委员会的主持下，于日惹附近的卡利阿朗，与由沙利尔等组成的印尼共和国代表团恢复谈判。会议进程一直保持秘密。本月七日，荷兰内阁使团突然自巴达维亚返国，谈判逐以未获协议而散。关于谈判未获协议的原因，据法新社五日电引巴达维亚观察家称：是由于荷兰要求给予荷驻印尼高级专员以否决权，及无须临时联邦政府的事先批准而使用武装部队之权。
    美国帝国主义者，是此次荷印谈判的牵线人。“当斯蒂克于十月访问华盛顿时，马歇尔曾暗示美国希望长久之僵持终能获一解决。”（美国新闻处华盛顿十一月二十六日电）当此次荷印谈判进行之时，联合国“调处”委员会美国代表柯克仑，曾努力至最后一分钟。美国急图解决荷印僵局的目的，不外为了使荷印反动派联合起来，加强对印尼人民与共产党的镇压以便于美国侵略势力深入印尼，加强对印尼人民的掠夺。为此，美国曾以贷款为饵，勾引哈达作进一步的驯服投降。据电通社新加坡十一月二十四日讯：美国允予印尼贷款的条件，曾由斯蒂克转达给哈达，内容首先是必须消灭印尼共产党，并建立与荷兰有稳固联系的新的联邦。华盛顿邮报记者柯恩在报道华盛顿方面希望荷兰与印尼共和国间能解决其僵局时公然声称：这一希望如果实现，将为大宗橡胶、白糖、椰子及其他“世界复兴”所需原料之开放。另一方面，自茉莉芬事件以来，哈达政府一直在忠实地履行美国的条件。日惹与梭罗的监狱里，已塞满了印尼的爱国分子。而荷印卡利阿朗谈判停顿后，哈达犹于五日自日惹赶至巴达维亚，企图最后获致协议。
    然而，印尼反动政府这种出卖祖国的行为，遭到印尼人民的反对。当荷印谈判进行之时，印尼人民始终坚持独立的要求，也没有放松与荷兰帝国主义的斗争。据塔斯社七日引印尼通讯社报道称：“在日惹的印尼工会中央领导机关，曾通过决议，指出印尼工会将拒绝任何可能损害共和国主权的协定”。又据美联社海牙八日讯：来自巴达维亚的荷兰军方消息显示，在过去一周中，荷兰控制的领域内发生了事件三百零七起，这是自去冬伦维尔协定以来一周之间发生冲突的最高数目。印尼广大人民反帝国主义反卖国的强烈意志，迫使投降主义者哈达在最后接受荷兰帝国主义的苛刻条件时，不得不有所顾忌。
