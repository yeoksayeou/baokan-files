    At the end of the south gate of Anguo, a long wooden sign points to a spacious courtyard, filled with bamboo tubes, tree coir, and newly made waterwheels. These water conservancy materials are gathered from markets in all directions and then transported to the masses. This is the Jizhong Second Water Conservancy Promotion Society. Its task is not only to supply the masses with water conservancy equipment, but more importantly, to organize the masses to develop water conservancy. In the past six months, it has organized well-digging and irrigation in the Suning and Boye areas, and has achieved great results. Now there are more than one hundred professional well-digging teams surrounding it.
    Half a year ago, people were still unfamiliar with the organization of the Water Conservancy Promotion Society. This spring, the Administrative Office's Department of Agriculture and Forestry sent three working groups to the eighth, ninth, and eleventh districts to carry out water conservancy work. They found that in many places, the masses were willing to build water conservancy facilities, but were greatly restricted due to the lack of equipment (such as bamboo tubes for digging foreign wells, iron cones, and tree coir, which were not easy to buy in small inland markets). Therefore, when summarizing the work in May, everyone put forward two experiences: first, water conservancy work must be done well with specialized organizations and professional cadres to lead it; second, there must be equipment and funds to cooperate when organizing the masses to build water conservancy facilities. Based on the above experience, the Jizhong Administrative Office allocated 200,000 yuan (new currency, the same below) from agricultural loans in June, and transferred more than 70 cadres to establish three Water Conservancy Promotion Societies. This is the origin of the Jizhong Water Conservancy Promotion Society.
    The work of the Water Conservancy Promotion Society began in Dawang Village, Suning, where it wanted to create miracles in areas without water conservancy habits. Dawang Village is full of dry land. Although the Water Conservancy Promotion Society came here to promote the benefits of irrigation, people were afraid of the labor and unwilling to invest so much capital, so it often failed to arouse the interest of the masses. One day, the cadres of the Water Conservancy Promotion Society accidentally discovered a living example: a man named Zhang Guangyi in this village had built a water field once in 1942. At that time, he did not have bricks for repairing the well, so he removed the eaves of his house. People in the village initially said, "The house is falling into the ground, and the land is falling into a pit," thinking it was a loss-making thing; in 1943, Zhang Guangyi planted two and a half mu of corn, and because it had been watered, he harvested three bags per mu, while his neighbors only harvested two dou per mu. Zhang Guangyi's example had won the envy of many people. The Water Conservancy Promotion Society seized this example and used accounting methods to publicize the benefits of well-digging and irrigation to the masses; the masses did not have well-digging equipment, and the Water Conservancy Promotion Society guaranteed low-cost supply; the masses did not have funds, and it introduced them to the Production Promotion Society to enjoy water conservancy loans; in this way, 52 households (41 poor farmers and 11 middle farmers) gathered their own private capital and borrowed 20,000 yuan to organize 13 well-digging groups, dug 10 new wells, repaired 3 old wells, and purchased 6 waterwheels. At that time, it was the time of drought in Jizhong, and suddenly more than 200 mu of watered land appeared in Dawang Village, and the crops grew lushly, which naturally attracted the attention of the masses in nearby villages. At this time, the Water Conservancy Promotion Society took Dawang Village as the focus and promoted the work to the surrounding villages. They first summoned the cadres of various villages to Dawang Village to hold a meeting, let them personally visit the water conservancy achievements and construction situation of Dawang Village, and then transferred cadres from Dawang Village, a key village, to nearby villages to publicize and mobilize. The actual examples of this village were publicized at various district and village cadre meetings. After half a month, 79 well-digging groups appeared in the villages around Dawang Village. These 79 well-digging groups dug 61 new wells, repaired 18 old wells, and manufactured 20 waterwheels, and built 1,350 mu of watered land in this area where there was no water conservancy foundation. Later, the influence of Dawang Village not only expanded to the entire third district, but also in the neighboring second and seventh districts, the masses automatically raised funds to dig wells and buy waterwheels.
    This was before September of this year. In September, the Jizhong Production Conference reviewed the entire water conservancy cause, believing that the primary task today should be to restore the original water conservancy work in the old water conservancy areas. According to this spirit, the Second Water Conservancy Promotion Society conducted a special survey in twelve villages in the five counties of Xinle, Dingxian, Anguo, Shenze, and Boye along the Pinghan Railway. The twelve villages had 2,982 households and 42,499 mu of cultivated land, of which 24,695 mu were watered land; there were 1,449 original wells, of which 499 were damaged; there were 470 original waterwheels, of which 143 were damaged. This situation shows that the water conservancy cause is developed in this area. During the survey, many district and village cadres believed that if production is to be improved by an inch next year, we must start with water conservancy; at the same time, this situation also shows the importance of restoring the old water conservancy. Therefore, in October, the Second Water Conservancy Promotion Society selected a key village in Anguo, Shenze, and Boye to lead the restoration of water conservancy work. The key village in Boye is Licun in the fourth district. The Water Conservancy Promotion Society organized 84 farmers here to raise funds to repair 9 old wells and 4 waterwheels, and expanded the watered land by 250 mu. In addition, there are 222 households in the village who have been organized and are preparing to start work next spring. There are many waterwheel factories in Anguo and Dingxian, and production often stagnates during the winter months (i.e., months with poor sales). This year, in order to enable these factories to continue production and supply the large needs of farmers next spring, the Water Conservancy Promotion Society recently ordered 107 waterwheels with 1.4 million yuan of funds, and the waterwheel factories have started work like a busy month.
    The half-year history of the Jizhong Second Water Conservancy Promotion Society proves that a leading organization is needed in the development of water conservancy. In the past six months, it has initially gained the trust of the masses and initially gained some experience: (1) To mobilize the masses to build water conservancy facilities, the initial step should be to use actual examples and accounting methods to explain the benefits of watered land. Only when the masses have calculated the accounts thoroughly can they boldly invest in water conservancy. (2) A specialized water conservancy organization is necessary for leading the development of water conservancy. In many places with water conservancy conditions, if there is a specialized organization to lead the development, the results will be even more considerable. (3) The task of the Water Conservancy Promotion Society is to organize the masses to develop water conservancy and supply the masses with water conservancy equipment. Therefore, in its work, it must obtain close cooperation from party and government organs and trade departments. In terms of purchasing water conservancy equipment and loans, it must be combined with economic departments and the Production Promotion Society.

　　访问冀中第二水利推进社
    在天旱缺雨的时候，大王庄出现了二百多亩绿油油的庄稼。
    本报记者  千峰
    在安国南关的尽头，一块长长的木牌引向一座宽敞的院落，那里堆满竹筒、树综和新制成的水车。这些水利器材从四面八方的市场上集拢来，再被输送到群众手里去。这就是冀中第二水利推进社。它的任务不仅供给群众水利器材，更重要的是组织群众发展水利，半年来它在肃宁和博野一带组织打井浇地，曾经收到很大成绩，现在围绕在它周围的已有一百多个专业打井班子。
    半年前人们对于水利推进社的组织还是生疏的。今年春天，行署农林厅派了三个工作组到八、九、十一三个分区进行水利工作，发现许多地方群众愿意兴修水利，但由于缺乏器材（如打洋井用的竹筒，铁锥、树综等在内地小市场上都不易买到），受到很大限制。由此到五月总结工作时，大家提出两点经验：一是水利工作要做好必须有专门组织和专业干部来领导；一是在组织群众兴修水利时要有器材和资金来配合。根据以上经验，冀中行署六月份从农贷中拨了二十万（新币，下同）款子，抽调了七十多个干部成立起三个水利推进社。这便是冀中水利推进社的来历。
    水利推进社的工作是在肃宁大王庄开始的，当时它想在没有水利习惯的地区开拓奇迹。大王庄全村尽是旱地，水利推进社来到这里虽然宣传了浇地的好处，但是人们怕费工，舍不得下那末多本钱，所以好多时引不起群众的兴趣。一天水利推进社的干部无意中发现了一个活的例子：这村一个叫张光义的，曾在一九四二年修过一次水地，当时他修井没有砖块，拆去了房檐，村里人们开始都说：“家里落炕土，地里落个坑”，认为是一件得不偿失的事情；到一九四三年，张光义种了二亩半玉米，因浇过雨水每亩收获三口袋，他的左右地邻每亩只收二斗，张光义的例子曾博得许多人羡慕。水利推进社抓住了这个例子，用算账的方式向群众宣传打井浇地的好处；群众没有打井器材，水利推进社保证廉价供给；群众没有资金，它把他们介绍到生产推进社里享受水利贷款；这样五十二户群众（四十一户贫农，十一户中农）自己集合了一部私资，另外借了二万元贷款，组织起十三个打井组，打成了十眼新井，修复了三眼旧井，购买了六辆水车。当时正值　冀中天旱，大王庄突然出现了二百多亩水地，庄稼长的绿油油的，自然引起附近村庄群众的注意。水利推进社这时就以大王庄为重点向着四外村庄进行推广工作，他们首先召集各村的干部到大王村来开会，让他们亲自参观大王庄的水利成绩及修筑情况，又从大王庄重点村抽调干部到附近村庄去宣传动员。在各种区村干部会上宣传这村的实际例子。经过半个月的过程，大王庄周围村庄出现了七十九个打井组，这七十九个打井组打成了六十一眼新井，修复了十八眼旧井，购制了二十辆水车，在这一带没有水利基础的地方修成水地一千三百五十亩。以后大王庄的影响不仅扩大到全三区，就是邻近的二、七等区，也有群众自动集资打井买水车的。
    这是今年九月份以前的事。九月，冀中生产会议上对于整个水利事业有着一个检讨，认为今天在旧有水利区恢复原有水利工作应是一个首要课题。第二水利推进社根据这个精神在平汉沿线的新乐、定县、安国、深泽、博野等五县的十二个村庄作了一次专门调查，十二个村二千九百八十二户，四万二千四百九十九亩耕地，其中水地二万四千六百九十五亩；原有水井一千四百四十九眼，损坏了四百九十九眼；原有水车四百七十辆，损坏一百四十三辆。这一情况说明了水利事业在这一带是发达的。在调查中许多区村干部都认为要明年生产提高一寸，必须从水利方面着手；同时这一情况也说明了恢复旧有水利的重要性。于是十月份第二水利推进社便在安国、深泽、博野各选了一个重点村，领导恢复水利工作。博野的重点村是四区里村，水利推进社在这里组织了八十四户农民集资修复了九眼旧井，四辆水车，扩大水地二百五十亩。另外该村还有二百二十二户已经组织起来准备明春动工。安国、定县一带有许多水车工厂，每到冬季背月（即销路不好的月份）期间生产往往停滞，今年水利推进社为了使这些工厂能照常生产，以供应明春农民的大量需要，最近特以一百四十万资金定购了一百零七辆水车，水车厂又如旺月似的开起工来。
    冀中第二水利推进社半年的历史证明：在发展水利工作中需要这样一个领导组织，半年来它开始取得了群众的信任，并初步的得到一些经验：（一）发动群众兴修水利，最初要以实际例子，用算账的办法来说明水地的好处，只有群众算透了账才能大胆的在水利上投资。（二）水利专门组织在领导发展水利事业中是必要的。在许多有水利条件的地方如有专门的组织进行领导开发，成绩当会更加可观。（三）水利推进社的任务在于组织群众开发水利和供应群众水利器材，因此在工作上必须取得党政机关和贸易部门的密切配合。在购买水利器材和贷款方面，必须和经济部门及生产推进社结合。
