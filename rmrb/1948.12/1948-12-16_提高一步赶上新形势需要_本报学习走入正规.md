　　Stepping Up to Meet the Needs of the New Situation
  　Our Newspaper's Study Enters a Formal Stage
    [Our Newspaper News] Since the North China Bureau's "Decision on On-the-Job Cadre Education" and the North China Bureau Direct Affiliated Learning Committee's study notice were issued, the newspaper's leadership and the general branch immediately convened responsible comrades from various departments and branches to specifically study how the newspaper should carry out its study, and formulated a study plan. First, regarding the study's organizational structure, a total of eighty-one people in the newspaper who are participating in theoretical study formed a theoretical study group. Other cadres with lower cultural levels from general affairs, electrical affairs, and factory departments, as well as individual editors, correspondents, and researchers with relatively poor cultural backgrounds, and all odd-job workers, all participated in cultural learning and formed a formal supplementary school. In terms of overall leadership, the newspaper committee is the highest leading body for study, and responsible cadres in other departments must be responsible for leading study at each level. The editor-in-chief is the principal, and the secretary-general is the dean. They are divided into four sub-schools according to residence and administrative unit. Each sub-school is further divided into advanced and elementary cultural classes based on the students' cultural and political levels, and each class is divided into two levels. Each class has a head teacher responsible for leadership, and students have class and group leaders. The learning committee also hired teachers and formulated study, examination, and leave systems. Regarding courses: in addition to compulsory theoretical learning and general social knowledge, students in each unit, in connection with their own work, proposed courses to be taught, which were uniformly decided by the learning committee for implementation. The opening ceremony was officially held on the evening of the first of this month. Comrades from the general editorial office conveyed the spirit of the notice from the direct affiliated learning committee and reported on the current situation. On the 2nd and 3rd, opening tests were conducted to understand the cultural level of the comrades participating in cultural learning. The results of the geography test in the advanced class of the first sub-school showed that some comrades could not completely write the number of provinces in China and their abbreviations. The answers to the Chinese test were mostly satisfactory for most comrades, but some comrades used grammar and punctuation marks inaccurately. The tests proved that many of our comrades lack the necessary cultural knowledge and common sense. It is urgent to improve cultural and theoretical levels to adapt to the rapidly developing victorious situation.
    Now, 297 students in our newspaper (including the factory) have excitedly entered a formal learning movement. In the newly built classrooms of the first sub-school, students are filling the seats every night. The learning committee requires that in this semester (December, January, and February of next year), the advanced class should complete the "A Brief History of Social Development" and intermediate-level history, geography, mathematics, and grammar, and learn punctuation marks. The elementary class should learn to a cultural level equivalent to upper primary school and basic theoretical knowledge.
    In addition, the theoretical study group is divided into groups by work unit, and it is determined that they all start with "A Brief History of Social Development." The method is mainly self-study, with necessary group discussions and special lectures. On the 2nd of this month, Editor-in-Chief Zhang Panshi conducted a mobilization in the theoretical group. Specifically, based on the book, he pointed out to everyone: what are the contents of the history of social development, why should we study it, and how to study it, etc. Now, each group is seizing the time to engage in in-depth self-study.

　　提高一步赶上新形势需要
  　本报学习走入正规
    【本报讯】自华北局“关于在职干部教育的决定”及华北局直属学委会之学习通知发出后，本报领导上与总支立即召集各部门各支部负责同志具体研究本社如何开展学习，并制定了学习计划。首先是学习的组织机构，全社参加理论学习的共八十一人，组成了学习理论组；其他总务、电务、工厂等各部门文化水准不高的干部，及编辑、通讯、资料部门之个别文化程度较差者，与全体勤杂人员，均一律参加文化学习，组成一个正规的补习学校。在总的领导方面，社委会即是学习的最高领导机关，其他各部门负责干部都必须逐级负责领导学习。社长即校长、秘书长即教务长。并按住处及行政单位分为四个分校，各分校又以学员文化政治水平分为高级、初级文化班，每班又分为两级。各班设有班主任负责领导，学员中设有班、组长。学委会并聘请了教员，制定了学习、考试、请假等制度。课程方面：除理论学习及一般社会知识必修外，各单位学员联系自己的业务，提出要讲的课程来，经学委会统一决定执行。本月一日晚正式举行开学典礼，由总编室同志传达了直属学委会通知的精神，报告了目前的形势。二、三两日进行了开班测验，以便于了解参加文化学习之同志们的文化水平。第一分校高级班地理测验的结果，有些同志写不完整中国有多少分省及其简称。国文测验大部同志所答尚为完满，有些同志文法和标点符号用不准确。从测验中证明，我们许多同志缺乏应有的文化知识与常识。急须提高文化、理论水平，才能适应迅速发展的胜利形势。
    现在本报（工厂在内）二百九十七名学员，已兴奋地进入正规学习运动中。在第一分校新修的课堂里，每晚都坐满了学生。学委会要求在这一学期（十二月及明年一月二月三个月）中，高级班要学完“社会发展简史”及中等程度的史地、数学、文法，学会标点符号。初级班学到相当于高小的文化程度与起码的理论知识。
    此外，理论学习组，以工作单位划分小组，确定一律从“社会发展简史”入手，方法以自学为主，进行必要的小组讨论，并设专题讲座。本月二日，张磐石社长在理论组进行了启发动员。具体的根据该书给大家指出：社会发展史有些什么内容，为什么要学它？及如何学习等。现各小组正抓紧时间深入自学。（秀实）
