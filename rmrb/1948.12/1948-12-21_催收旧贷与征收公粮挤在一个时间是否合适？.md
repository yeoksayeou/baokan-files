To the Editor:
　　Recently, the People's Daily has continuously published reports on the achievements of various regions in collecting old loans. In the past, some places confused loans (grain) with relief, and it was wrong to emphasize lending and neglect collection. Loans (grain) should be recovered when they are due. However, according to our recent survey on the burden of the people in the southern Hebei countryside, combining the collection of old loans with the collection of public grain at the same time creates many difficulties for the masses in repaying loans (grain) or paying public grain. This is especially true for some newly emancipated farmers. Although they have obtained land, their yields are generally lower than those of old middle peasants due to a shortage of farm tools, fertilizer, and livestock. However, their enthusiasm for production is high. Some rely on loans (grain) combined with selling some grain from their wheat harvest (or autumn harvest) to obtain funds for production (such as buying livestock, farm tools, and engaging in sideline occupations). Some even owe debts before the wheat or autumn harvest. Therefore, the grain obtained from the wheat and autumn harvests is not considered heavy in terms of burden (generally not exceeding 20% of their agricultural income), but adding the collection of loans (grain) and repayment of deficits makes it unbearable. After paying public grain, they cannot repay the loans (grain); after repaying the loans (grain), there is nothing left to eat. Some have to tighten production (selling livestock or reducing sideline operations). We feel that:
　　(1) There is a lack of necessary consideration for newly emancipated farmers in terms of agricultural burden this year, which is worth studying and reviewing.
　　(2) Is it appropriate to combine the collection of old loans with the collection of public grain at the same time? This is also worth considering.
　　(3) It is suggested that the collection of old loans should differentiate between regions (poor, rich, good harvest, poor harvest), distinguish between targets, and provide续贷 (continued loans) assistance to some newly emancipated households, especially in areas with poor harvests. Strengthen publicity and education and avoid mechanically general collection. Otherwise, it will have adverse consequences on the lives and production of these households.
　　We hope that the above opinions will be considered and that attention will be paid to whether similar situations are occurring in other regions. (Zuo Baiyi)
　　Editor's note: Comrade Zuo Baiyi's opinion is worth the attention and study of relevant parties. Recently, our reporter encountered this problem during an interview in Pindin. The combination of paying public grain and repaying old loans, although the public grain is not heavy and the masses have high enthusiasm, has a considerable impact on the lives and production of farmers who have just survived the disaster. We hope that this issue will arouse the attention of relevant parties for study.

### 催收旧贷与征收公粮挤在一个时间是否合适？

　　催收旧贷与征收公粮挤在一个时间是否合适？编辑同志：
    近来人民日报不断发表各地催收旧贷取得成绩的报导，过去有些地方把贷款（粮）与救济混为一谈，重放轻收是不对的，贷款（粮）到期应该收回。但根据我们最近在冀南下乡作人民负担的调查发现：催收旧贷与征收公粮挤在同一时间，却给群众归还贷款（粮）或交纳公粮以许多困难。在这里特别是一部分新翻身户，他们虽然得到土地，但因农具缺、肥料少、没有牲口，产量一般比老中农低些，但他们生产情绪高，有的依靠贷款（粮）结合自己麦季（或秋季）出籴一部分粮食（贷款数小，不敷用），换得资金投入生产（如买牲口、农具、搞副业等），有的甚至在麦前或秋前已欠下些债，所以按麦、秋收下的粮食，拿负担来说并不算重（一般不超过其农业收入的百分之二十），但加上收贷款（粮）还亏空等，却吃不消了。交了公粮还不起贷款（粮），还了贷款（粮）吃的无剩余，有的只得紧缩生产（出卖牲口或缩小副业经营）。我们觉得：
    （一）今年在农业负担上对新翻身农民缺乏必要的照顾，值得研究检讨。
    （二）催收旧贷与征收公粮挤在一个时间是否合适？也值得考虑。
    （三）建议在催收旧贷中应区别地区（穷、富、丰收、歉收），分别对象，对某些新翻身户，特别是歉收区给以续贷之照顾，加强宣传教育，不能机械的一般的催收。不然将产生影响这些户生活生产的恶果。
    以上意见，希考虑，并注意在其他地区是否亦发生类似情况？（左白易）
    编者按：左白易同志这个意见，值得提起有关方面的注意和研究。日前本报记者在平定采访中，也遇到这个问题。交公粮还旧贷挤在一起，虽然该地公粮并不重，群众情绪也高，但对于刚刚渡过灾荒的农民，生活与生产上，却受到相当的影响。这问题望能引起有关方面研究。
