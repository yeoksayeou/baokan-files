    Disabled Veterans Should Not Solely Rely on Substitute Farming; They Should Cultivate a Small Garden Themselves
    To the Editor:
    In our village, the disabled veteran Fu Wenbin, because he is a disabled veteran with only one arm, was allocated four mu of jute land and seven or eight fen of reed land during the movement two years ago. In addition, he was specially allocated eight or nine fen of vegetable garden (yielding 1.8 dan). At the time, the vegetable garden was allocated to him to take care of his single arm, so that he only needed to do some weeding to obtain great profits, exceeding the original yield by twofold. This spring, all his land has been substitute farmed, except for the garden, which is now completely barren. The masses are reflecting, "It is such a pity that the land is barren." Is the disabled veteran responsible, or is the village cadre responsible? (Xian Zeng, Pei Zhen, Huyan Village, Seventh District, Zuoquan)

    Answer: Regarding Comrade Fu Wenbin, the village's special consideration for his disability is very good, but it should not exceed the average amount of land held by local residents too greatly, as this would increase the burden on the masses and also affect the masses' substitute farming, leading to land barrenness. Comrade Fu Wenbin should also not have a reliance mentality, solely relying on substitute farming and allowing the land to become barren when substitute farming is not provided. In addition to the masses' substitute farming, the remaining land should be managed well through mutual aid or hiring people to increase his income and improve his life, which would benefit both the public and private sectors. Ignoring it and letting the land remain barren is wrong and should be corrected.

### 荣军不该单凭代耕  一点园子应该自种

专栏：询问与答复

    荣军不该单凭代耕
    一点园子应该自种编辑同志：
    我村荣誉军人傅文斌，因他是一个胳膊的荣军，在前年运动中除分给他四亩麻地和七八分苇地外，又特别分给他八九分菜园（产量一石八）。当时给他菜园时是照顾他一个胳膊，只要他能锄锄草，就能得大利，能超过原产量的二倍，在今春他的地都已代耕，只是园子没有代耕，现在这园子完全荒了，群众都反映“地荒的真可惜。”到底是该荣誉军人负责，还是该村干部负责？（左权七区壑岩村仙曾、培真）
    答：关于荣军傅文斌同志，村中对他的残废情形特别照顾，是很好的，但不应超过一般当地群众土地平均数量太大，这样会增加群众负担，同时又要影响群众代耕，以致土地荒芜。傅文斌同志亦不应有依靠思想，单凭代耕，不给代耕就让土地荒了，除群众代耕外，余下土地就应该用变工或雇人把地经营好，增加自己的收入，改善自己的生活，公私两方都有好处。如置之不理，让土地荒芜着，是不对的，应予改正。
