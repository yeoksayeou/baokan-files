　　Beiyue Third Prefectural Committee's Inspection of Various Counties' Resolution of Land Reform Legacy Issues
    Since the Pingxi Sub-district's expansion cadre meeting in mid-September, all counties have achieved significant progress in resolving issues left over from land reform. The current situation in various counties is as follows: 375 villages have had their class status re-evaluated, accounting for 88.9% of the 422 villages that have undergone land reform; 281 villages have resolved the issue of floating wealth, accounting for 66.8% of the villages that have undergone land reform; 88 villages have determined land ownership and are ready to issue land certificates (including all of Laishui, and most of Wanping and Liangxiang, which have completed class status review and resolved the issue of floating wealth); the leading ideology of "rather left than right" has been basically corrected; and the exemplary leadership of branch party members has been brought into play in the work style, playing a significant role in resolving issues left over from land reform. However, some deviations have also occurred in the process of resolving legacy issues. Although there are still a few district and village cadres who hold a resistant attitude towards resolving land reform legacy issues, this is no longer the main deviation. The main deviation is that they do not clearly understand the significance of correcting deviations and dare not boldly publicize policies; and right-leaning deviations have arisen in the process of correcting left-leaning deviations. For example, after the Laizhuo Prefectural Committee's expansion cadre meeting, they did not dare to boldly publicize policies, fearing that it would cause panic among the peasants, and even dared not convey the spirit of the Prefectural Committee's meeting; as a result, the more they feared chaos, the more chaotic it became, even affecting autumn production (already corrected). In nine villages, including Nianzigou and Yushanpu in the seventh district of Laishui, households that had been struggled against illegally went to the homes of poor peasants to take things, and the district committee did not deal with it in a timely manner until the county committee discovered it and sent a working group to resolve it. In Zhuanghu Village, the first district of Huailai, the land reform was not thorough, and the land of the landlords and rich peasants who were struggled against exceeded the average; only one wrongly struggled cadre could not maintain his livelihood; and individual poor households have not been able to completely turn over. In this case, efforts should be made to appropriately meet the demands of individual poor households who have not turned over, and the problem can be solved even if compensation is made; however, the working group in the village, without looking at the specific situation, misunderstood the spirit of correcting deviations and returned everything uniformly. As a result, the poor peasants said, "Those who beg for food still have to beg for food." The wrongly struggled households took the opportunity to demand more things from the poor peasant associations, originally only taking five jars, but they insisted on demanding nine jars from the poor peasant associations. In resolving the issue of floating wealth in Banggezhuang, Liangxiang, the middle and poor peasants were equally divided by household. The most serious thing was that the Changwan County Committee erroneously put forward the erroneous principle of "using the method of regulation, doing everything possible for the poor peasants, without losing the poor peasants' capital. To appropriately meet the requirements of the middle peasants, to achieve the unity of the middle and poor peasants." In addition, the leadership method of paternalism and the adoption of simple command methods also caused losses to the work.
    The reasons for the above problems: First, the bureaucratic work style of the leadership. After the problem of Nianzigou and other nine villages in the seventh district of Laishui occurred, the district committee knew about it but did not solve it in a timely manner. The chairman of the poor peasant association went to the district to report, and the district committee was playing cards, waiting for a reply, shirking responsibility, and still not taking care of it. The Prefectural Committee has decided to reprimand it. (Should be severely reprimanded - Editor) Second, the position of some cadres is not stable enough. Some village cadres who have been struggled against, and even individual district and county cadres, took advantage of the correction of deviations to retaliate and deliberately made things difficult for the poor peasant associations (This is not a matter of unstable position, but a complete loss of the position of a Communist Party member, and even standing on the position of landlords and rich peasants. - Editor). Third, there are few cadres, a lot of work, and the cultural and theoretical level of the cadres is too low, and they do not thoroughly understand the spirit of resolving land reform legacy issues. Therefore, in future work, the first thing to do is to clarify the situation, and the working group should formulate a plan based on the situation before proceeding. In the process of carrying out the work, we must specifically carry out the struggle on two fronts, appropriately and correctly resolve the land reform legacy issues, and prevent negating the necessity of correcting left-leaning deviations in the process of correcting the right-leaning deviations that have occurred. First, we must give full play to the exemplary leadership of branch party members, first explain the policy to branch party members, and through branch party members, dispel the peasants' fear of correcting deviations, actively unite with the middle peasants to solve problems, and educate the wrongly struggled households to overcome the idea of revenge. All commandist practices that do not go through the ideological fermentation of the masses are wrong. Third, the level of cadres is low, and there are many new cadres, so the method of using the experience of key villages to guide the general should be adopted. (Ruan Bosheng)

### 北岳三地委对各县解决土改遗留问题的检查

　　北岳三地委对各县解决土改遗留问题的检查
    平西分区自九月中旬扩干会议后，各县在解决土改遗留问题上均获得了显著的成绩。各县目前进行的情况是：已改订成份的有三百七十五个村，占已实行过土改的四百二十二个村庄的百分之八十八点九；已解决了浮财问题的有二百八十一个村，占实行过土改村的百分之六十六点八；已确定了地权，即可发土地证的有八十八个村庄（其中涞水的全部，宛平、良乡的大部都完成了审订成份、解决了浮财问题）；领导思想的“宁左勿右”，基本上得到了纠正；在工作方式上发挥了支部党员的模范带头，在解决土改遗留问题中起了很大作用。但在解决遗留问题的过程中也发生了一些偏向。目前虽仍有少数的区村干部对解决土改遗留问题仍抱抵制态度，但已不是主要的偏向了。主要的偏向是对纠偏的意义认识不清，不敢大胆的宣传政策；在纠正左偏中又产生了右偏。如涞涿在地委扩干会议后，不敢大胆宣传政策，怕引起农民的恐慌，甚至不敢传达地委会议的精神；结果是越怕乱越乱起来了，以至影响了秋季生产（已纠正）。涞水七区碾子沟、玉山铺等九个村庄，被斗户非法地到贫农家去拿东西，区委并未及时处理，直到县委发觉后，才派工作组去解决。怀来一区庄户村，土改时本不彻底，被斗的地主、富农土地均超过平均数以上，只有一户被错斗的干部不能维持生活；而个别贫苦户尚未能彻底翻身。在这种情况下，本应设法适当地满足个别未翻身贫苦户的要求，及个虽进行补偿即可解决问题；但在该村工作的工作组，却不看具体情况，误解纠偏精神，一律退回。结果贫农说：“要饭吃的还得要饭吃去。”被错斗户则乘机向贫农团多要东西，本来只出了五个缸，就硬向贫农团要九个缸。良乡班各庄在解决浮财问题时，则采取中、贫农按户平均分配。最严重的是昌宛县委错误地提出了“用调剂的方式，尽贫农力量，不亏贫农老本。达到适当满足中农要求，达到中、贫农团结”的错误原则。此外，领导方法上的包办代替，采取简单的命令方式也使工作受了损失。
    发生以上问题的原因：第一是领导上的官僚主义作风。涞水七区碾子沟等九村的问题发生后，区委知道了也没去及时解决。贫农团主席到区去报告，区委还打着扑克待理不待理的推脱责任，仍不去管。地委已决定给以指责。（应严加指责——编者）第二是某些干部的立场不够稳。被斗过的某些村干部，甚至个别的区、县干部，趁着纠偏进行报复，故意和贫农团为难（这不是什么立场不够稳，而是完全失去共产党员立场，甚至是站到地主富农立场上去了。——编者）。第三是干部少，工作多，及干部的文化、理论水平太低，对解决土改遗留问题的精神了解的不透彻等。为此，今后在工作中首先是弄清情况，工作组根据情况定出方案再去进行，在进行中要具体开展两条战线的斗争，适当而正确的解决土改遗留问题，防止在纠正已产生的右偏中，又否定纠正左偏的必要。第一，必须充分发挥支部党员的模范带头作用，先在支部党员中讲清政策，通过支部党员打通农民害怕纠偏的思想，积极的去团结中农解决问题，并教育被错斗户，克服报复思想。一切不经过群众思想酝酿的命令主义作法是错误的。第三，干部水平低，新干部多，应采用以重点村的经验指导一般的方法。    （阮泊生）
