Xinhua News Agency, Huaihai Front, 15th: How to lead and consolidate the participating laborers from the new districts has become an important issue in the logistics work of the Liberation War. In this regard, a unit of the Central Plains People's Liberation Army has summarized the following experiences:

First, conduct education to raise the political consciousness of the laborers.

According to surveys, new district laborers had the following concerns when they began participating in the war: First, they were afraid of being incorporated into the army, because they had painful experiences of being conscripted by the Chiang bandit army in the past; second, they were afraid of going to the front line, because they were afraid of danger; third, they were afraid of airplanes; fourth, they were afraid of being too far from home; fifth, they were afraid of not having enough to eat; sixth, they were afraid of the time being too long; seventh, they were afraid of night marches; and eighth, they were afraid that their families' lives would not be taken care of. When they were performing war service, they wanted to know where they were going, how far they were going, and they requested frequent shifts to return home early, and more shoes, etc.

Therefore, when leading new district laborers, special attention should be paid to enlightening their political consciousness. They should be encouraged to talk about the pain of their past lives and the persecution they suffered from the Chiang bandits. From the bitterness, they should realize that the root of past suffering was the Kuomintang reactionaries, and that revenge could only be achieved by relying on today's People's Liberation Army. Therefore, carrying stretchers and transporting grain and ammunition for the People's Liberation Army is a glorious and obligatory responsibility. At the same time, laborers should also be regularly given current affairs education to establish their confidence in victory and encourage their courage to participate in the war. In addition, they should also be helped to find solutions based on the difficulties and demands of the laborers, and they should be educated to overcome difficulties. Leading cadres should live with the laborers, pay attention to changes in their thinking and emotions, discover problems at any time, and educate them in a timely manner. Special attention should be paid to discovering and cultivating activists among the laborers, and educating other laborers through them. As for the universal problems that occur among the laborers, collective answers can be given during rest or before assembly and departure.

Second, caring for and cherishing the laborers is the most practical political work.

Caring for and cherishing the laborers is one of the most practical and important political tasks. Comrade Wang Zhiguo, a cadre in charge of laborers in this unit, had a positive influence among the laborers because of this. The laborers said: "Old Wang marched at night, walking at the back to embolden us. When he arrived at a place, he helped everyone find houses, find grass, and distribute grass. After everyone went to sleep, he went to get food, and at dawn, he was still settling accounts with the villagers. Old Wang truly put others first and himself second." Because Wang Zhiguo cared for and cherished them in this way, not only did the laborers not desert, but they also improved their understanding of our Party and our army. For example, they said: "You old Eighth Route Army people really do what you say, and you do what Chairman Mao says." When the laborers completed their tasks and returned home, some laborers held the hands of the staff and were reluctant to separate, and some even cried, and some left their names and villages. Laborers who could not write said: "My home is in a certain village, there are several big trees in front of the door..."

Third, strengthen administrative management and develop economic democracy.

Based on the laborers' characteristics of acting casually and being unaccustomed to collective life, administrative management must be tightened, but the management method should be mainly persuasion and education. In the work of persuasion, one should always proceed from caring for and cherishing them. For example, to the laborers who fall behind during the march, say: "Don't fall too far behind, it's not easy to find the team if it gets mixed up, and if you fall behind, there are no troops to take care of you, and it's easy to get into danger." "Wasting time on the road will make it difficult to get enough rest at the camp, which will easily increase fatigue." In this way, the laborers are happy to hear it, and it also achieves the effect of asking them to obey the command. This kind of leadership and management should be done through the local cadres who lead the laborers, because they understand the feelings of the participating laborers better than the army cadres, and the laborers believe what they say more. Therefore, army cadres must help local cadres to strengthen the management and education of the laborers, and not form a situation where army cadres take over everything, which is the key to whether the laborers are well-led or not. Secondly, the method of marching review should also be used to carry out mass commendations and criticisms to improve the laborers' discipline and organization, and to give full play to their enthusiasm for participating in the war. In terms of life management, a high degree of economic democracy should be developed, and organizations such as economic committees or life committees should be established, so that everyone can democratically manage their lives, which is of great benefit to the laborers' democratic education, improving their lives, consolidating the laborers, and strengthening the relationship between the army and the people.

### 淮海前线我军某部领导新区民工经验

　　淮海前线我军某部领导新区民工经验
    【新华社淮海前线十五日电】如何领导并巩固新区的参战民工，在解放战争的后勤工作中，现已成为一个重要问题。在这方面，中原解放军某部总结了如下的经验。
    第一，进行教育提高民工政治觉悟
    根据调查，新区民工开始参战时有下列几种思想顾虑：一是怕编入队伍，这是因为他们过去有被蒋匪军抽夫抓丁的惨痛经验；二是怕上前线，因为怕危险；三是怕飞机；四是怕离家太远；五是怕吃不饱饭；六是怕时间长；七是怕夜行军；八是怕家里生活无人照顾。他们在担任战争勤务时，希望知道往哪里去，走多远，要求常换班早回家，要求多发鞋子等。
    因此，在领导新区民工时，应特别注意启发他们的政治觉悟。应启发他们漫谈过去生活的痛苦与所受蒋匪的迫害。从诉苦中，使他们认识过去的苦难根源是国民党反动派，要报仇雪恨，只有依靠今天人民解放军。因此，为解放军抬担架，运粮弹，是光荣的与应尽的责任。同时还应经常对民工们进行时事教育，奠定他们的胜利信心，鼓舞他们的参战勇气。此外并要根据民工的困难与要求，帮助他们想办法，对他们进行克服困难的教育。领导干部应经常与民工在一起生活，注意其思想情绪的变化，随时发现问题，及时教育，尤其要注意发现与培养民工中的积极分子，通过他们来教育民工。至于民工中所发生的带有普遍性的问题，可利用休息或集合出发前的时间进行集体解答。
    第二，关心与爱护民工是最实际的政治工作
    关心和爱护民工，就是最实际最重要的政治工作之一。该部民工干部王志国同志就是因为这一点而在民工中产生了良好的影响。民工们说：“老王晚上行军，走到后面，给咱们壮胆。到一个地方，他帮大家找房、找草、发草。大家睡了，他又去搞粮食，天明了，他还在和老乡算帐。老王真正作到先为人后为己了。”由于王志国这样爱护和关心他们，不但使得民工没有逃亡，而且提高了他们对我党我军的认识。如他们说：“你们老八路真是说啥就是啥，毛主席说啥你们就作啥。”当民工完成任务回家时，有的民工拉着工作人员的手不愿分离，甚至有哭的，有的给留下名字和村庄。不会写字的民工说：“我家住在某村，门前有几棵大树………。”
    第三，加强行政管理开展经济民主
    根据民工们行动随便与不习惯集体生活等特点，行政管理必须抓紧，但管理方法应当以说服教育为主。在说服工作中，应处处从关心爱护他们出发。如对行军掉队的民工说：“不要掉得太远了，队伍被插乱了不好找，掉了队，后面没有部队照顾，容易出危险。”“在路上浪费了时间，到宿营地得不到充分休息，容易增加疲劳。”这样，民工听了愉快，而且收到了要他们服从指挥的效果。这种领导管理，应该通过带民工的地方干部，因为他们比部队干部更了解参战民工的心情，他们说话民工也更信服。所以部队干部必须帮助地方干部来加强对民工的管理教育，不要形成部队干部包办，这是民工带好与否的关键。其次还要运用行军检讨的方式来开展群众性的表扬与批评，以提高民工的纪律性与组织性，发挥他们参战的热情。对生活管理上，高度的开展经济民主，设立经济委员会或生活委员会等组织，由大家民主管理生活，这对民工的民主教育及改善他们的生活、巩固民工、密切军民关系，都有极大好处。
