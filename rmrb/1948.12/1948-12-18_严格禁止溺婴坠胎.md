　　Strictly Prohibit Infanticide and Abortion
    I.
    I have an opinion: some rural women still drown female infants. In my village, there are more than twenty boys, but only a dozen girls, a difference of more than double. On average, four or five infants are killed each year in my village. If we consider the entire district, the number would be far too high. After the infanticide, the usual excuse is "the infant wasn't breathing after birth" or "the pregnancy wasn't full term." A few years ago, the government issued a circular prohibiting this, but it is still very serious. I raised this issue with some village cadres, but they either said they "didn't know" or "don't care about such trivial matters." I think this phenomenon is not a small problem; it is an old feudal tradition that has a great impact on the reproduction of the nation. I hope this can be published in the newspaper to draw attention to it everywhere. The government should issue a clear prohibition, and village cadres in all areas should publicize this and mobilize the masses to oppose infanticide.

    II.
    In various places, some doctors, for the sake of personal gain, disregard human life and secretly sell several kinds of highly toxic herbal medicines to women who are secretly pregnant, at high prices. As a result, the fetus dies, and the adult's body is also harmed, even to the point of death. The doctor's responsibility is to treat diseases and save lives, not to harm others for personal gain, and certainly not to kill people. The government should strictly prohibit this situation, and individual doctors who perform abortions should be appropriately punished. As far as I know, some pharmacies and doctors in Meng County City, Shangshe, and Daheng Gou in the first district, often prescribe medicine or injections to induce abortions for profit, resulting in harm to human life. From the latter half of last year to the present, there have been abortions in Zhonglan Village in the second district of Meng County, Shuiquan Village in the first district, Zhongzhuang Village in Xuyugou in the fifth district, and Chi Village in the ninth district. These are just the ones I know about; there must be many more such incidents in other places. I hope leaders at all levels will pay attention to the investigation and strictly prohibit this.

### 严格禁止溺婴坠胎

专栏：批评与建议

　　严格禁止溺婴坠胎
    一、
    我有个意见，就是还有些农村妇女溺害女婴。我村有男儿童二十几个，女儿童只有十几个，相差一倍以上。我村小儿每年平均被害四五个，要按全区来说，那就太多了。溺害以后，一般都是说“小儿产后没气”，或是说“怀胎不够月数”。头几年政府也曾下过通令禁止，但到现在还是很严重；我向一些村的村干提这个意见，他们不是说“不知道”，就是说“不管那闲事。”我想这种现象不是个小问题，是一种旧的封建传统，对民族的繁殖上有很大影响。我希望能在报上登出来，引起各地注意；政府应明令禁止，各地区村干部更应到处宣传，发动群众反对溺婴。

    二、
    在各地有些医生，为了个人贪图巨利，不顾人命竟使用几种剧毒草药，偷偷地高价卖与怀私胎的妇女们，结果胎儿死掉，大人身体也会受到损失，甚至丧命。医生的责任，是治病救人，而不是损人利己，更不应是杀人害命。这种情况政府应严格禁止，对个别医生的坠胎行动应予适当处分。据我所知道的，孟县城和上社及一区大横沟的一些药铺和医生，就这样为自己发财常施以药齐或打针，为人坠胎，以致伤害人命。由去年后半年到现在，孟县已有二区中兰村一闺女，一区水泉村、五区徐峪沟里中庄村、九区池村各一妇女坠胎。这仅是我知道的，其他地方一定也有不少这类事件，希各级领导注意调查，严格禁止。
