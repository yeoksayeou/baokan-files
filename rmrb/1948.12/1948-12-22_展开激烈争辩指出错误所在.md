　　Criticism of general party members and cadres was also carried out quite seriously and earnestly. For example, Zhiwei Qunzhong (a name), a member of the branch committee, concealed the property of a rich peasant, hiding it for several months before reporting it to the branch, and even then did not report it all. Everyone criticized him, saying that this was a manifestation of his failure to transform his thinking: on the one hand, he wanted to gain merit and share the fruits in front of the Party and the masses; on the other hand, he could not break ties with the rich peasant, wanting to please them. Some people pointed out more sharply: this kind of two-faced, trying-to-please-everyone, straddling-two-boats attitude is not the attitude of a Communist Party member. Some analyzed that the reason he had not overcome this kind of thinking after being in the Party for so long was that he had not seriously accepted the Party's education to transform himself. Everyone pointed out that straddling two boats would ultimately lead to one's own downfall, and that Party rectification was to save oneself, which made the person being criticized understand. The final stage of the criticism movement was a summary evaluation of merits and demerits. This stage adopted a method of self-reporting and public discussion, and there were many debates during the process. For example, Qiao Zhishun believed that his organization and leadership of the mutual aid team was a merit, but some disagreed, saying, "This was arranged by the branch, it is the responsibility of a party member, and cannot be considered a merit." After discussion, everyone rejected the latter statement. Because many mutual aid teams collapsed after the correction, the branch arranged for leadership of mutual aid, but no one else managed to get it going, only Qiao Zhishun persuaded the masses, resolved disputes and family conflicts among the members, and consolidated mutual aid. Later, he organized the members to go down to the kiln, transport goods, and weave, so that everyone benefited a lot and everyone was satisfied. Everyone said it should be considered a merit. There were also some party members who shielded landlords and rich peasants, stole the fruits of struggle, and did so knowingly, so they were all given major demerits. In addition, some situations looked like merit, but upon actual investigation, it was clarified that they could not be considered merit for a Communist Party member. The initial evaluation results showed that the merits mainly included supporting the military, production mutual aid, participation in the war, and active participation in the land reform struggle. The demerits mainly included shielding landlords and rich peasants and encroaching on the fruits of the struggle. There were sixteen people with more merits than demerits, three people with more demerits than merits, and one person with merits and demerits in equal measure. During the second re-evaluation at everyone's request, there were some small changes (such as the aforementioned Li Xuanlin), and some added demerits and merits. In the end, everyone felt that right and wrong were clear, and the merits and demerits were accurate. (Editor's note: This method of self-reporting and public discussion of merits and demerits within the Party is worth considering. Because: First, mobilizing party members to self-report merits fundamentally violates the principle of educating party members and cadres with a spirit of self-criticism, and recording demerits is not a formal disciplinary action within the Party, which is not in accordance with the Party Constitution; Second, without mass assessment and comprehensive investigation by higher authorities, it is difficult to have a correct standard for evaluating merits and demerits.)
　　On the basis of the basic resolution of the problems within the branch, preparations began for the re-election of the branch committee. After discussion, everyone believed that the branch committee should have the following four conditions: 1. Clear stand, able to distinguish between the enemy and us; 2. Democratic style, responsible in work; 3. Impartial in handling affairs, not selfish, not biased towards relatives and friends; 4. Able to see the overall situation in work and do good things for the majority of the village (also must be able to conscientiously implement the Party's policies. Otherwise, they will commit village-basedism – Editor). According to these four conditions, everyone first affirmed that two branch committee members could remain in office and not be re-elected, and four other branch committee members (one of whom was an alternate) were elected. (Generally speaking, after Party rectification, the branch committee should be completely re-elected, and the method of supplementary election cannot be universally applied. – Editor) Then, candidates were democratically nominated, candidates were examined, and finally, elections were held by secret ballot, and everyone was satisfied. In this way, the initial Party rectification work of the branch ended on November 20 and turned to ending land reform, combined with Party rectification.

　　展开激烈争辩指出错误所在
    对一般党员干部的批评，也做得相当严肃认真。如支委群众（人名）隐藏富农小闹的财物，藏了几个月才向支部报告，还没有全报出来。大家批评他说，这是思想没有转变的表现：一方面想在党和群众面前立功、分果实；一方面又和富农切不断关系，想讨人家的好。有人更尖锐的指出：这种两面光、两头讨好、脚踏两只船的态度，不是共产党员的态度，有人分析他入党好久始终没有克服这种思想的原因，是不认真接受党的教育来改造自己。大家指出这种脚踏两只船，最后落水的将是自己，整党就是为了挽救自己，这样使被批评者想通了。批评运动的最后阶段，是总结性的评功评过。这一段采取自报公议办法，进行中曾有不少争论。比如，乔志顺认为自己组织领导互助组是功，即有人不同意说：“这是支部布置的，是党员应尽的责任，不能算功。”经过讨论，大家否定了后面这种说法。因为纠偏以后许多互助组垮了，支部布置了领导互助，但别人都没搞起来，只有乔志顺说服群众，解决组员中的纠纷与家庭纠纷，巩固了互助，以后又组织组员下窑、运输、纺织，使大家获利不少，人人都满意。大家说应该算一功。也有一些党员，因为包庇地富，偷取果实，且是明知故犯，所以都记了大过。另外，有一些情况看去是功，但实际追究起来，就一个共产党员说不能算功的，也弄清了。第一次评判结果，有功的方面，主要有优军、生产互助、参战、土改中斗争积极等。有过的方面，主要是包庇地富，侵占斗争果实。总计功多过少的十六人，过多功少的三人，功多过也多的一人，第二次在大家要求下进行复评时，有些小的改变（如上述栗轩林），有的又补充了过错和功劳。最后大家都觉得是非分明，功过切实。（编者按：这种党内评功评过自报公议的办法是值得考虑的。因为：第一、发动党员自报功劳，根本违反以自我批评精神教育党员干部的原则，记过亦非党内正式处分，不合党章规定；第二、评功评过不经群众鉴定与上级全面考查，功过就难有正确标准。）
    在支部内部问题大体获得解决的基础上，开始酝酿改选支委，经大家讨论，认为支委应具有以下四项条件：一、立场明确，能分清敌我；二、作风民主，工作负责；三、办事公正，不自私，不偏向亲友本家；四、工作上能看全面，为全村大多数办好事情（还须能认真执行党的政策。否则，会犯村本位主义——编者）。根据这四个条件，大家首先肯定了两个支委可以留任，不改选，另外选四个支委（其中一人候补），（一般说，经过整党，应该彻底改选支委，补选的办法不能通用。——编者）然后民主提出候选人，审查候选人，最后以不记名投票方式进行了选举，大家都还满意。这样，该支部的初步整党工作即于十一月廿日结束，转入结束土改，结合整党。
