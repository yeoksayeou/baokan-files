　　Liberation Fighter Wang Youcai

　　"Give me any task and I will complete it!" This is a phrase that Liberation Fighter Wang Youcai often repeats, and though the words are simple, they express his determination and understanding of the revolution. But words are empty without the test of battle. In the Battle of Niutuozhai, his words were completely and thoroughly realized.
　　Comrade Wang Youcai was in the Third Platoon of the Ninth Company of the 21st Regiment. He was liberated during the Linfen Campaign. Because he had been deceived by the propaganda of the Chiang-Yan bandits, he initially believed that we "didn't trust" him, that the People's Liberation Army and he were "two separate families," and he didn't even dare to tell the truth when chatting about family matters. It wasn't until after the Jinzhong Campaign ended, when the company launched a campaign to recount sufferings, clarifying how the poor people's suffering came about, that he spoke about how his family was also poor. Starting from his grandfather's generation, they relied on selling tofu and renting land to survive. His family of over ten people struggled hard every year, always lacking food and clothing. He didn't know these reasons in the past. After recounting his suffering, things became very clear. At the same time, he understood that being a soldier in the People's Liberation Army was completely different from being a soldier for the bandits. So he ran to the company headquarters, found Instructor Li, corrected his history and family situation, and examined himself for not telling the truth in the past. He said, "I am from Shaanxi, but I will not go back to Xi'an after it is liberated. I will definitely liberate all of China."
　　When the attack on Taiyuan began, he thought: This is my chance to perform meritorious service. During the battle of Niutuozhai, the company assigned his platoon the task of rescuing the wounded. He proposed, "I guarantee that not a single wounded person will be left on the front line." After breakfast on the 18th, the enemy and our artillery fire became increasingly intense. He estimated that with such intense fighting, we would definitely have casualties. Without waiting for the platoon leader to order, he handed his rifle to the new soldier Zhao Xiaozui and said, "You are young and have little strength, so you guard the weapons for us. I will go and carry the wounded." After speaking, he ran alone to the front line despite the enemy's artillery fire. There were already wounded soldiers in the first row. He immediately carried one and left, thinking as he walked: I should first carry those on the front line and those with the most serious injuries, otherwise they will lose too much blood, or if the enemy fires more shells, wouldn't they sacrifice? The second time he went up, he carried them according to what he had thought. He was covered in sweat, so much so that he couldn't even open his eyes. Finally, he took off his cotton coat. Once again, the artillery fire became even more intense, and the road to the command post was blocked by the enemy's machine guns. At this time, he encountered the Second Platoon Deputy, Li Jingen, who was wounded. He carried him on his back and walked. When he reached the enemy's blocked intersection, the machine gun fire was very fierce. The Second Platoon Deputy said, "It's best to wait a while before walking, so you don't get hit." Wang Youcai said, "It doesn't matter, I'll carry you and walk faster, otherwise you'll lose more blood and it will be harder to treat." He desperately rescued the Second Platoon Deputy from the enemy's artillery fire.
　　On the 21st, the whole company's task was to deliver ammunition to the First Battalion. Once, Platoon Leader Du Xinming led a platoon, each person carrying a box of grenades. After climbing two mountains, suddenly the enemy's machine gun fire made it impossible to pass. Everyone stopped in a small cave on the mountainside. At this time, no one was walking. After waiting for a while, the enemy's artillery fire became even more intense. Wang Youcai thought: This is exactly when ammunition is needed. He proposed, "We must deliver it even if it costs our lives. In an emergency, the loss of even one box of ammunition can cause the loss of the position. Now is the time to perform meritorious service. It is glorious to sacrifice for the people!" As soon as he finished speaking, the soldier Du Jinfu responded, "Yes! This is the time to perform meritorious service for the people!" He and Du Jinfu braved the enemy's artillery fire to deliver the ammunition to the front line. Afterwards, everyone followed, and under his encouragement, they successfully completed the task of delivering ammunition.
　　After this battle, the campaign to evaluate the battle was launched. At the company's military meeting, a unanimous vote was passed to award Comrade Wang Youcai a major commendation and to promote him to deputy platoon leader.　　　　　　　(This manuscript was written by a comrade in the unit.)

　　解放战士王有才
    解勇
    “给我什么任务完成什么!”这是解放战士王有才常不离口的一句话，语句虽然简短，正表现了他的决心和对革命的认识。但是没经过战斗考验，话总是空的。这次牛驼寨战斗，他的话是不折不扣彻底实现了。
    王有才同志在二一部队九连三班，临汾战役时才解放过来。因遭蒋阎匪的欺骗宣传，初来总认我们“不相信”他，解放军和他是“两家人”，甚至谈起家常，他都不敢实说。直到晋中战役结束，连上开展诉苦，闹清穷人的苦是怎样来的，他才讲自己家里也是个穷人，从祖父手上起，就靠卖豆腐租种地过生活，全家十多口人，苦苦受上一年，总是少吃没穿。这些原因，过去他是不知道的。诉苦以后，闹的非常清楚，同时了解了在解放军里当一个战士和给胡匪当兵完全是两样。于是他跑到连部找到李指导员，重新更正了自己的历史、家庭状况，检讨自己过去不说实话不对，并说：“我是陕西人，将来解放了西安我也不回去，一定把全中国解放了。”
    进攻太原开始，他心里想：这是我立功的时候到了。打牛驼寨，连部给他班的任务是抢救伤员，他提出：“保证不让一个伤员留在火线上。”十八日早饭后，敌我双方的炮火一阵比一阵紧急，他估计打的这样激烈，我们一定会有伤亡，没等班长吩咐，他把枪交给新战士赵小咀说：“你的年岁青，力气小，给咱看管武器，我给咱去背伤员。”说完他独自一人冒着敌人的炮火跑到阵地上，一排已经有战士负伤，马上背了一个就走，边走边想：应该先背最前线和伤最重的，不然流血过多，或者敌人再打来炮弹，不是就要牺牲吗？第二回上去，就照他想的那样去背，直背的他浑身是汗，汗流的连眼睛也睁不开，最后把棉衣也给剥了。又一次上去，炮火打的越发激烈，到指挥所的路也被敌人用机枪封锁住。在这个时候，碰上二排副李井恩负伤了，他背上就走，走到这敌人封锁的路口，机枪打的很凶，二排副说：“最好等一等再走，免得把你打着。”王有才说：“没关系，我背你走快一些，不然你流的血多了更不好治。”他拼命把二排副从敌人的炮火中抢救下来。
    二十一日，全连的任务是给一营送弹药，一次由排长杜新明率领一个班，每人背一箱手榴弹，连爬了两个山头，忽然敌人机枪打的不能通过，大家在山腰的一个小窑停止了，这时走路的人一个也没有。待了一阵，敌人的炮火更激烈起来，王有才心里想：这正是需要弹药的时候，他提出：“我们拼着命也得送，情况紧急有时缺一箱弹药阵地就会失守，现在正是立功的时候，为人民牺牲是光荣的！”他刚说完，战士杜金福就响应说：“对！为人民立功就是这时候！”他二人冒着敌人炮火把弹药送上阵地，随后大家也跟着上来，在他的鼓动影响下，顺利的完成了送弹药的任务。
    此次战斗下来，开展战评运动，在全连的军人大会上，全票通过给王有才同志立大功一次，并推选任副排长。　　　　　　　（此稿系部队同志所写）
