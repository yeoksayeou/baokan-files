[Taihang Dispatch] Shi Cunjin, a labor hero first-class of Taihang, elected twice, has been diligently leading his family in production and construction, achieving significant results in the past two years since returning from the Second Taihang Mass Congress in 1946, firmly believing in the Party's policy of prosperity through hard work. Recently, he formulated a new three-year production and construction plan. On the evening of November 3rd, Shi Cunjin gathered his entire family, old and young, to summarize the achievements of the past two years of production and construction: In 1946, he had two donkeys, which have now been replaced by two mules. Last spring, he built three houses, and in the autumn, he constructed a millstone and a grinding stone. He has added two seeders, one harrow, one plowshare, four hoes, three plows, a new saddle, and water buckets to his farm implements. He has also bought three new pots, a bellows, two grain bins, four cloth bags, two winnowing fans, two raincoats, and new textile tools, including a hand-pulled shuttle loom and three spinning wheels. Now, his family has nearly everything they need. Shi Cunjin firmly believes in the Party's production policy and often promotes the idea of focusing on production for prosperity to the masses, while also influencing and promoting the entire village through his own actions (buying five mu of land), with a total of more than forty mu of land purchased by others. This year, Shi Cunjin's agricultural production yielded a total of 29.2 shi of grain, 8 shi of corn, 4.8 shi of beans, 3.5 shi of sorghum, and more than 10,000 jin of yams, radishes, and other vegetables. This autumn, he harvested a total of 43.5 shi of grain (market shi); adding the 4.8 shi of wheat harvested in the summer, the total grain harvest for the year was 48.3 shi. After expenses, the surplus grain is sufficient for the entire family to eat. This year, he also picked more than 20 jin of cotton, bringing the total cotton stock to more than 30 jin with the old stock. This autumn, he planted more than seven mu of wheat after the previous crop, applying 40 loads of manure per mu, estimating a yield of 8 market shi of wheat next year. The entire family has achieved sufficient food, new clothes, new houses, and a harmonious and democratic family life. Shi Cunjin said, "In the past, when I worked as a hired hand for others, I had nothing. Now, my family of nine cultivates 29 mu of land, hires a farmhand, raises two big mules, and has become a hero. In the future, I am determined to focus on my own production and promote prosperity for everyone under the leadership of the Communist Party." After the summary, the entire family discussed and formulated a three-year production and construction plan. The family has two male laborers. In the future, they will continue to hire one farmhand, two female laborers, cultivate 29 mu of land, and raise two mules. In agriculture: In the next three years, the main goal is to improve quality. Next year, 60 loads of fertilizer will be applied per mu. The year after, 65 loads of fertilizer will be applied per mu, and by 1951, 70 loads of fertilizer will be applied per mu. Second, thoroughly till the soil twice, hoe four times, repair borders and build embankments, conscientiously select seeds for all fields, pay attention to preventing and controlling diseases and pests, implement seed disinfection, and cultivate more high-quality varieties to increase yields in all aspects. They also plan to plant eight fen of indigo next year, one mu the year after, and one and a half mu in 1951. In construction: Because the houses are still not spacious enough, one house (three to five rooms) will be added each year in the future, and two dilapidated kilns will be repaired. In sideline production: The two mules will be used for transportation in their spare time, earning five shi of millet each year; five sheep will be raised each year, developing to fifteen sheep in three years; three more hens will be raised next year. In textiles: Two more quilts will be added. The two female laborers and two female children in the family will spin 30 jin of yarn this winter, 50 jin next year. After deducting 15 jin for seasonal needs, the remaining 35 jin will be used to buy two large shi of rice. In 1950, when the girls grow up, they can spin 80 jin of yarn. After deducting 30 jin for clothing, the remaining amount can be used to buy three large shi of rice. In 1951, textile technology will be further improved, spinning 90 jin of yarn. After deducting the amount needed for clothing, the rest can be used to buy 3.5 shi of rice. The plan concludes by proposing to eat more bran and vegetables this winter to contribute more public grain in support of the war and thoroughly overthrow the reactionary government of Chiang Kai-shek.

　　自己闹好生产
  　推动大家发家
  　劳英石寸金又订出三年计划
    争取多交公粮　早日打倒蒋匪
    【太行电】两次当选为太行一等劳动英雄的石寸金，自一九四六年参加太行二届群众大会回去后，坚信党的发家致富政策，带领全家生产建设，二年中做出了很大成绩。最近又订出三年生产建设计划。十一月三日晚，石寸金召集全家老少把前二年生产建设成绩作出了总结：一九四六年喂着两头驴，现已换成两头骡；去年春盖了三间房子，秋天又建筑了碾、磨各一盘，农具上新增加耧两张，耙一面，还有一面铧，四张锄，三张犁，一张新鞍和水桶等。新买锅三口，风匣一个，谷囤两个，布袋四条，簸箕两个，雨单两个，纺织工具也新买了手拉梭机一架，纺车三辆；到现在全家差不多已做到用什么有什么。石寸金坚信党的生产政策，经常向群众宣传安心生产发家，同时又以自己的实际行动（买地五亩）影响推动全村，共买了四十多亩地。今年石寸金的农业生产，共打谷二十九石二斗，玉茭八石，豆子四石八，高粱三石五，刨山药、萝卜等菜一万余斤。今秋总共打粮四十三石五斗（市石）；加上夏天收麦四石八斗，全年共收粮四十八石三。除开支外，余粮足够全家食用。今年又摘净花二十余斤，连旧存花共有三十余斤。秋天种改茬麦七亩多，每亩上粪四十驮，估计明年可收麦八市石。全家已做到粮食足用，穿新衣、住新房，家庭民主和睦。石寸金说：“过去咱给人家当长工，要啥没啥，现在全家九口人，种着二十九亩地，还雇着一个长工，喂着两头大骡子，又当了英雄，今后决心在共产党的领导下，闹好自己生产，推动大家发家富。经过总结，全家又讨论出三年生产建设计划。全家共有两个男劳力，以后，仍雇长工一人，两个女劳力，土池二十九亩，两头骡。农业方面：在三年内主要是提高质量，明年每亩上肥六十驮。后年每亩上肥六十五驮，到一九五一年每亩上肥七十驮。二、耙二、锄四、修边、垒堰，认真做到全部田间选种，注意除治病害，实行种籽消毒，多种优良品种，从各方面提高产量。并计划明年种蓝八分，后年种一亩，一九五一年种一亩五。建筑方面：因房子仍不宽广，以后每年要增盖房子一座（三间至五间），并修理两座破窑。副业生产方面：两头骡抽空搞运输，每年赚小米五石；每年发展五只羊，三年发展十五只；明年再养三只母鸡。纺织方面：增加两条被子，全家两个女劳力和两个女儿童，今冬纺织三十斤，明年纺织五十斤，除换季需十五斤，下余三十五斤买米两大石。一九五○年女孩长大了，可纺线八十斤，除三十斤穿用，下余买米三大石。一九五一年纺织技术再提高，纺织九十斤，除穿用外买米三石五斗。计划中最后提出今冬多掺糠菜吃，争取多交公粮支援战争，彻底打倒蒋介石反动政府。
