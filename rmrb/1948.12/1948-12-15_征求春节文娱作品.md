The North China Government's Ministry of Education has issued instructions calling for literary and artistic activities to be carried out during the Spring Festival. In order to provide everyone with literary and artistic works, this newspaper is soliciting creations such as Yangko operas, Kuaiban operas, drum songs, ballad books, and songs. The content should correctly reflect policies, publicize military victories, strengthen people's unity, enhance production enthusiasm, encourage support for the front lines, promote democratic governance, and improve the masses' ideological culture. Whether it is individual creation or collective creation, it is welcome. It is best not to be too long, so as to be suitable for amateur troupes and rural troupes to perform. We hope everyone will contribute actively, and once published, the remuneration will be generous.
