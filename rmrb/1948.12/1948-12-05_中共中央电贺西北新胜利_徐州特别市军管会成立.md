We hope you will continue your efforts to completely annihilate Hu Zongnan's bandit troops and liberate the Great Northwest.

    The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China
    December 1, 1948

    Xinhua News Agency, Xuzhou, 3rd—Following the liberation of Xuzhou, the East China Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army immediately announced the establishment of the Xuzhou Special Municipality Military Control Commission, and appointed Fu Qiutao, Yuan Yelie, Zhou Lin, Feng Ping, Hua Chengyi, and others as members of the Xuzhou Military Control Commission, with Fu Qiutao as the director of the Military Control Commission, Feng Ping as the deputy director, Yuan Yelie as the commander of the Xuzhou Garrison, and Zhou Lin as the mayor of Xuzhou.

    Introduction to Xuzhou

    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 3rd—Xuzhou City, the largest military base and important strategic hub for the Kuomintang reactionaries in their counter-revolutionary civil war, was occupied by the People's Liberation Army at 10 p.m. on the 1st. The defending enemy abandoned the city and fled westward, and the People's Liberation Army is in pursuit. Xuzhou is the most important strategic city occupied by the Chinese People's Liberation Army since the occupation of Shenyang on November 2nd. Xuzhou is the northern gateway to Nanjing, the key point of the four provinces of Jiangsu, Anhui, Shandong, and Henan, and also the key point of the entire northern and central China. Xuzhou has been a strategic location for military strategists since ancient times. It was formerly known as Pengcheng, and Xiang Yu established his capital here after the fall of the Qin Dynasty. Since the Three Kingdoms period, it has been the territory of Xuzhou. In the Qing Dynasty, Xuzhou Prefecture was established, and Tongshan County was separately established, named after Tongshan in the northeast of the county, so it has been called Tongshan since the Republic of China. After Xuzhou became the intersection of the Tianjin-Pukou and Longhai Railways, it became important not only militarily but also commercially, and the population has increased year by year, now exceeding 400,000. Since Chiang Kai-shek launched the counter-revolutionary civil war, he has always regarded Xuzhou as the largest troop deployment area on the southern front, and successively established the Army Headquarters Xuzhou Command, the Xuzhou Pacification Headquarters, and the Xuzhou Bandit Suppression Commander-in-Chief, with major Kuomintang bandit chiefs, former Chief of General Staff of the Ministry of National Defense Chen Cheng, Commander-in-Chief of the Army Gu Zhutong, and Xue Yue, Liu Zhi, etc., taking turns to be stationed there. At the beginning of 1947, Chiang Kai-shek concentrated more than 80 reorganized brigades (divisions) in the Xuzhou area to implement a key offensive against the East China battlefield, vainly attempting to drive the East China People's Liberation Army north of the Yellow River and then open up the Tianjin-Pukou Railway. After this arrogant plan completely failed, the Xuzhou battlefield remained the most important battlefield on the southern front. Until November of this year, when the People's Liberation Army launched the Huaihai Campaign, Chiang Kai-shek again concentrated 66 divisions in the Xuzhou area to implement the so-called key defense. However, his key defense collapsed even faster than the key offensive. After the uprising of He Jifeng and Zhang Kexia's troops, the annihilation of Huang Baitao's corps, the encirclement of Huang Wei's corps, and the defeat of Li Yannian and Liu Ruming's two corps, Chiang Kai-shek was finally forced to withdraw from Xuzhou.

　　中共中央电贺西北新胜利
    徐州特别市军管会成立
    【新华社陕北三日电】中共中央电贺西北人民解放军新的胜利。电称：
    彭德怀、贺龙、林伯渠、习仲勋、张宗逊、赵寿山诸同志，并转西北人民解放军全体同志们：
    庆祝你们歼敌第三十六军两个整师、第六十九军一四四师和第三军十七师大部共十个整团近三万人的巨大胜利。尚望继续努力，为全歼胡宗南匪军，解放大西北而战。
    中国共产党中央委员会
    一九四八年十二月一日
    【新华社徐州三日电】徐州解放后，中国人民解放军华东军区即宣布成立徐州特别市军事管制委员会，并任命傅秋涛、袁也烈、周林、冯平、华成一等为徐州市军管会委员，傅秋涛为军管会主任，冯平为副主任，袁也烈为徐州市警备司令，周林为徐市市长。
    徐州介绍
    【新华社陕北三日电】国民党反动派进行反革命内战的最大军事基地和重要战略枢纽徐州城，已于一日晚十时被解放军所占领。守敌弃城西逃，解放军正追击中。徐州是中国人民解放军继十一月二日占领沈阳后所占领的最重要战略城市。徐州是南京北面的大门，是江苏、安徽、山东、河南四省的要冲，也是整个中国北部和中部的要冲。徐州自古为兵家必争之地。古名彭城，秦亡后项羽曾于此建都。自三国以后，即为徐州治地。清设徐州府，另置铜山县，以县境东北有铜山得名，故民国以来仍称铜山。徐州在成为津浦、陇海两铁路的交点以后，不但在军事上而且在商业上也有了重要性，人口逐年增加，现已有四十余万。蒋匪介石在发动反革命内战以来，一直把徐州作为南线最大的屯兵场，曾先后设置陆军总部徐州司令部，徐州绥靖公署，徐州剿匪总司令，由国民党主要匪首前国防部参谋总长陈诚、陆军总司令顾祝同及薛岳、刘峙等相继坐镇。一九四七年初，蒋介石曾在徐州地区集中八十几个整编旅（师），实行对华东战场的重点进攻，妄想将华东人民解放军逐至黄河以北，再进而打通津浦路。这一狂妄计划彻底失败以后，徐州战场仍然是南线最重要战场。直到今年十一月，人民解放军发动淮海战役，蒋介石又在徐州地区集中六十六个师，实行所谓重点防御。但是他的重点防御比重点进攻破产得还要快。在何基沣、张克侠部起义，黄伯韬兵团被歼，黄维兵团被包围，李延年、刘汝明两兵团被击溃以后，蒋匪终于被迫退出徐州。
