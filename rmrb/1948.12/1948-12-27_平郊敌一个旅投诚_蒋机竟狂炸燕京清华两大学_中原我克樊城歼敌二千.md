Xinhua News Agency, Beiping Front, December 25th: A delayed dispatch: The enemy's Hebei Security First Brigade in the suburbs of Beiping collectively surrendered to the People's Liberation Army. Two regiments of this enemy force were routed by the besieging People's Liberation Army in Mengjia Village and Niutou Village southwest of Beiping on the 14th and 15th. They attempted to flee back into the city, but were blocked by the Nationalist army guarding the city defenses. They then fled in panic through Guang'anmen towards the area south of Xihongmen, where they were again intercepted by the People's Liberation Army. The enemy then requested surrender through its deputy brigade commander and laid down all their weapons.

Xinhua News Agency, Beiping Front, December 25th: Tsinghua and Yenching Universities in the western suburbs of Beiping are in good order after liberation. With the exception of a few students who are trapped inside the city, and Tsinghua University's President, Mei Yiqi, a member of the Kuomintang Central Executive Committee, who has flown from Beiping to Nanjing, the rest of the faculty and students, including foreign professors from both universities, have remained safely on campus. Yenching University resumed classes on the 15th, and Tsinghua University is scheduled to resume classes on the 20th. The People's Liberation Army has been warmly welcomed by the students and professors. The representatives of the People's Liberation Army entering the two universities were quickly surrounded by students, who requested lectures and forums. Students volunteered to serve the wounded soldiers of the People's Liberation Army. The lack of firewood and vegetables in the two universities has been resolved by the People's Liberation Army to the best of their ability. However, American planes supplying the Kuomintang dropped ten bombs, including one fragmentation bomb, over the two universities around noon on the 19th. The bombing only caused minor damage, but aroused strong resentment among professors and students.

Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains, December 24th: A unit of the Central Plains People's Liberation Army captured Fancheng, opposite Xiangyang on the north bank of the Han River, on the 22nd. In the battle to capture Fancheng and the mopping-up operation around Fancheng on the 21st, the enemy's 726th Regiment of the 237th Division, including Deputy Commander Li Tiefeng and Battalion Commander Wu Biqing, and over 2,450 others were captured alive. More than 200 teachers and students from Xinye Middle School, who were abducted by the bandit leader Wang Lingyun, commander of the 13th Pacification Zone, when he fled Nanyang, were rescued. Detailed battle results are currently being investigated.

Xinhua News Agency, East China, December 24th: (Delayed) Xinghua City, a famous water town northeast of Gaoyou in northern Jiangsu, was recovered on the morning of the 13th, and the defending bandits fled. The democratic government immediately entered the city to work.

Xinhua News Agency, East China, December 24th: Delayed news: On the 11th, the Jiaodong People's Liberation Army completely annihilated the first and second battalions of the 319th Regiment of the 107th Division of the 50th Army of Chiang's bandits, who came out of Chengyang (more than 20 miles southwest of Jimo, located on the Jiaoji Railway) to harass us, at Xujiagou, fifty miles west of Jimo city. The battle lasted only about an hour. The enemy's deputy regimental commander, Yan Junwei, with the rank of major, and the first battalion commander, Song Wenhan, with the rank of major, and over 460 others were captured, and the enemy's second battalion commander, Song Douyin, and over 100 others were killed or wounded. Nine 60mm mortars, thirty-three light and heavy machine guns, two hundred and sixty-one long and short guns, thirty Thompson submachine guns, and a quantity of ammunition and military supplies were seized.
