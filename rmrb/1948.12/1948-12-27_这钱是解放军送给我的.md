　　"This Money Was Given to Me by the People's Liberation Army"
　　Xiao Yi
　　In Tiancheng Village, seventy miles east of Xinliang City, there lived Luo Chouzi, with a family of seven, living in a dilapidated earthen house, cultivating a dozen acres of barren land. When the Japanese came, the family's food went from oats to millet, and when Fu Zuoyi came, they couldn't even eat millet mixed with chaff. Therefore, Luo Chouzi schemed day and night: planting three acres of garden, and relying on those dozen acres of dry land, carrying a peddler's pole in the slack season, maybe the days could be eked out. The vegetable seeds in the garden sprouted, green and oily, even and fertile, and Luo Chouzi's family was very happy!
　　Insects ate the vegetable leaves, and Luo Chouzi caught them one by one and pinched them to death; when the land was dry, he watered it day and night. Even though it was so hot, the family didn't rest for a moment. Every night, Luo Chouzi was so tired that his legs were stiff and his back ached, but he still had to go to the field to check again... Seeing that his radishes and fennel cabbages were growing so well, he was truly happy in his heart.
　　The radishes were about to come out of the garden, and Luo Chouzi counted: fifty rows, two hundred in each row, ten thousand radishes, that was the family's living for the whole summer!
　　But at this time, Fu Zuoyi's "Self-Defense Corps" came down from the blockhouse, three or five at a time, and entered the garden, saying:
　　"Ah, Chouzi, your radishes are growing really well, let's try one!" Before leaving, they took three or five more. The next day, other people came again:
　　"Chouzi, let's try one!"
　　Chouzi watched them bite into the radishes crisply, just like biting into his heart.
　　This couldn't go on forever, so Chouzi asked a few people to intercede, and secretly spoke to the "Self-Defense Corps Leader".
　　Who knew, the next day even more people came, and entered the garden:
　　"Chouzi, pull five pounds of radishes!" Chouzi thought, this time it was much more proper, they didn't even do it themselves. But before leaving, they said: "Put it on the tab!" and left without looking back.
　　Luo Chouzi said with heartache: "Of this big patch of radishes, I didn't even get two-tenths of it."
　　Autumn came, and Luo Chouzi's brow furrowed even tighter. The remaining fennel cabbage grew so fat, and the large scallions grew so full, but Chouzi thought sadly:
　　"Before, planting millet, three acres of land could still yield five or six dou, now it's all over."
　　But suddenly the People's Liberation Army came, and the "Self-Defense Corps" quietly fled in the night.
　　"Old fellow, how much is your fennel cabbage per catty? Ah, good big scallions, weigh some of those too." The comrades who came over all said this.
　　"Oh, comrades, you just take a look, you can take as many as you want." Chouzi answered uneasily.
　　"That won't do, we are the People's Liberation Army, fair buying and fair selling, how can we just offer a price as we please? Old fellow, you give a fair price, so neither of us will suffer."
　　Luo Chouzi's two acres of fennel cabbage and scallions were sold in this way. The fewer vegetables there were, the more money he had in his pocket. He happily said to people:
　　"This money was picked up by me, it was given to me by the People's Liberation Army!"

　　“这钱是解放军送给我的”
    萧逸
    在新凉城东七十里的天成村，有个罗丑子，家里七口人，住一间破土房，种十来亩薄地。日本来了。全家吃的从莜麦降到了谷米，而傅作义一来，连谷子里掺糠也吃不上了。因此罗丑子白日黑夜地计谋：种上三亩园子，再靠那十来亩旱地，农闲时担个货郎担，日子也许可以挨过去。园里菜子发芽了，碧绿油油的，又匀又肥，罗丑子一家多高兴！
    虫子吃菜叶了，罗丑子一条条捉起来，捏死他；地旱了，白天黑夜的浇水，天这样热，一家人也不小息一忽，每到天黑累得罗丑子腿硬腰酸，还要到地里再看一回，……看到他拔萝卜、茴子白长得这样好，心眼里真高兴。
    萝卜快出园子了，罗丑子数数：五十畦，一畦两百个，一万个萝卜，这是一夏天的生活呀！
    但是这时傅作义的“自卫团”从炮楼上下来了，三个五个的，一进园子说：
    “啊呀，丑子，你的萝卜长得真好，咱们尝一个！”临走又带上三五个。第二天，另一些人又来了：
    “丑子，咱们尝一个！”
    丑子看着他们一口口清脆的咬着萝卜，正好象一口口的啃他的心。
    这样下去是没尽头，丑子托了几回人，悄悄的向“自卫团长”去说情。
    那知，第二天来的人更多了，一进园子：
    “丑子，拔五斤萝卜！”丑子想，这回可规矩多了，他们自己不动手了。但临走却说：“记上帐！”头也不回的走了。
    罗丑子心痛的说：“这一大块萝卜，我十成连两成也没捞上。”
    秋天来了，罗丑子的眉头皱的更紧，残剩的茴子白长的这样肥，大葱出挑得这样丰满，但丑子却伤心的想：
    “早先种谷子，三亩地还可捞上五斗六斗，现在什么全完了”。
    但是突然解放军过来了，“自卫团”黑夜里悄悄逃走了。
    “老乡，你的茴子白多少钱一斤？啊，好大葱，也给秤上些个。”过来的同志都这样说。
    “哎呀，同志，你瞧着罢，你老拿几个算几个。”丑子不安的答。
    “那不行，咱们是人民解放军，公买公卖，怎能随我出价钱呢？老乡，你说个公道价，咱俩都不吃亏。”
    罗丑子两亩茴子白和大葱就这样卖出去。菜越少了，他口袋里的钱越多了，他高兴得什么似的对人说：
    “这钱是我拾到的，是解放军送给我的！”
