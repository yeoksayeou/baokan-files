Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 2nd. The long general strike of French coal miners, lasting 56 days to demand improved living standards, has been declared over. The French Miners' Federation ordered all striking miners on November 27 to officially return to work starting on the 29th. In this longest general strike in France after the war, French workers dealt a heavy blow to French monopoly capitalists: in October alone, it caused French capitalists to lose approximately 3.5 million tons of coal, or about 18 billion francs. After November, although the Christian Workers' Confederation and the so-called "Workers' Force" union of the Socialist Party betrayed the interests of the miners by compromising midway, the workers under the leadership of the Miners' Federation of the General Confederation of Labor persisted to the end. In order to sabotage this strike, the French government carried out frantic suppression, but this only further exposed its hideous face and the fragility of its rule. During the strike, French miners received enthusiastic support from the French working class, as well as small and medium-sized bourgeoisie and peasants, ranging from vocal support to material donations and even strike actions. Abroad, workers in the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, Italy, Poland, Bulgaria, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and other countries also sent huge amounts of donations, highly demonstrating the friendship of the international working class.

After the French miners announced their return to work, the French government gleefully declared it their "victory." The French Communist Party's newspaper "L'Humanité" wrote in an article that although the French government could claim a temporary "victory" from the French miners' return to work, in reality, this victory itself carries the seeds of the government's future failure. The newspaper pointed out that although the miners' enemies rejected all their moderate demands, the mere existence and unity of the nearly two-month strike forced the government to make concessions to the metalworkers in Lorraine, the workers of the Paris subway, other public service employees, and dockworkers, to prevent them from joining the miners' struggle. "In this way, the miners have enabled other workers' organizations to win their demands, prepared the conditions for a general improvement in the living standards of all workers, and thus also improved the conditions for improving the living standards of the miners themselves."

### 法国矿工罢工结束　总罢工坚持五十六天独占资本家遭沉重打击

　　法国矿工罢工结束
　  总罢工坚持五十六天独占资本家遭沉重打击
    【新华社陕北二日电】法国煤矿工人为要求提高生活水平而坚持五十六天的长期总罢工已宣告结束。法国矿工联盟已于十一月二十七日下令所有罢工矿工，从二十九日起正式复工。法国工人在战后最长的这一次总罢工中，给予法国独占资本家以沉重的打击：仅在十月份内，就使得法国资本家们损失煤约三百五十万吨，或一百八十亿左右法郎。十一月以后，虽然由于基督教工人联盟及社会党的所谓“工人力量”工会叛卖矿工的利益中途妥协，但在总工会矿工联盟领导下的工人们仍坚持到最后。为破坏这次罢工，法国政府曾经进行了疯狂的镇压，但这不过再一次暴露它的狰狞面貌及其统治的脆弱而已。在罢工期间，法国矿工们获得了法国工人阶级以及中小资产阶级和农民，从声援到物质捐助以至采取罢工行动的热烈支持。在国外，苏、美、英、意、波、保、匈、捷等国的工人，亦汇赠巨量捐款，高度地发扬了国际工人阶级的友爱。
    在法国矿工们宣布复工以后，法国政府竟兴高彩烈地宣称这是他们的“胜利”。法共机关报“人道报”著论指出：虽然法国政府可以以法国矿工的复工而自称获得暂时的“胜利”，但实在地这个胜利本身就带着政府未来失败的种子。该报指出：虽然矿工的敌人们拒绝了矿工们的一切温和要求，但仅仅是将近两个月的罢工的存在和团结一致，就迫使政府对洛林的金属工人、巴黎地下火车的工人及其他公共事业雇员，以及码头工人让步，以防他们参加矿工的斗争。“矿工们这样地使其他工人组织赢得了他们的要求，准备了普遍提高全体工人生活水平的条件，因而也就提高了矿工们自己生活水平的条件。”
