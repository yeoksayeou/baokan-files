　　Changzhi Nantianhe Labor Hero Cao Linshui
  　Leads the Improvement of Agricultural Technology
  　Village's Harvest Exceeds Output
    [Taihang News] Labor hero Cao Linshui of Nantianhe, Changzhi, led farmers to improve agricultural production technology, and this year's output exceeded the planned output by 340 shi. The village has 2,357 mu of land, with a planned output of 163 shi, and the actual grain harvest was 2,503 shi. The reasons for exceeding the planned output, in addition to the farmers' understanding of the land reform production policy and their peace of mind in production, the active leadership of Cao Linshui played a considerable role. This is mainly reflected in: (1) Actively improving production technology. Since Cao Linshui participated in the Second Taihang Heroes Conference in 1946, he absorbed Shi Cunjin's experience in intensive farming and more fertilization. Last year, he contacted farmers with agricultural technology in the village and organized an agricultural technology research association to conduct on-site experiments in each production season. He first applied more fertilizer to his own few acres of poor land. This year, one mu of local wheat yielded 1 shi and 4 dou, and two mu of "169" wheat yielded 2 shi and 5 dou, breaking the idea of some people that "it is useless to apply more fertilizer to bad land," making the masses realize that no matter what kind of land, as long as more fertilizer is applied, more grain can be harvested, thus promoting more fertilization by the masses throughout the village. Last summer, the technical research association promoted the selection of wheat seeds by farmers. This year, almost all "169" wheat in other regions developed jaundice and the yield decreased; however, the "169" wheat in his village did not have jaundice, and the yield was 9 dou, 1 sheng, and 5 he per mu. This promoted the universal selection of seeds by the masses throughout the village in the summer and autumn seasons this year. (2) After Cao Linshui absorbed Shi Cunjin and Li Shunda's disinfection and seed soaking methods, he organized farmers to carry out seed soaking and intensive farming. This year, almost all of the main crop wheat land in the village was plowed three times, the intercropped wheat land was plowed once and harrowed twice, and the autumn land was generally ploughed. (3) Guiding farmers on what fertilizer to apply to what land, and what crops to plant on what land. During spring plowing this year, Cao Linshui convened the agricultural technology committee to study how to fertilize and sow. After the study, they mobilized everyone to apply more manure and pig manure on the sunny slopes, and sheep manure, pen manure, and oil cake should be applied on the low-lying and shady areas. The high land should be planted with Mao Huanggu (which is not afraid of wind when ripe), and "169" wheat, and the ditches and depressions should be planted with "Hen's Beak" and "Dabai Gu," so that the crops grow particularly well, with large and full grains. (4) He took rectifying his own mutual aid group as an example, conscientiously implemented equal value change work and work recording according to labor, and promoted the masses to do the same. In order to lead the masses in the village to carry out winter production, he convened a mass meeting of the whole village; according to the actual situation of the village, he formulated a practical winter production plan. In agriculture: strive to apply 90 dan of manure per mu of autumn land next year. In terms of fertilizer sources, in addition to the existing various fertilizers that can be applied to 710 mu, there is still a shortage of fertilizer for 845 mu of land. The plan is to solve this by earning cake from oil mills, fumigating fertilizer, digging pond soil, and removing pen soil. In terms of sideline occupations: it is planned to organize livestock and manpower for transportation and sales, and strive for an income of 60,000 yuan (new currency, the same below). It is required that the existing oil mills and tofu workshops strive for an income of 110,000 yuan this winter. It is also planned to increase 10 heads of livestock this year, establish a nursery of 0.7 mu, and require each person to plant two live trees next year.

　　长治南天河劳动英雄曹林水
  　领导改良农业技术
  　全村收获超过产量
    【太行讯】长治南天河劳动英雄曹林水领导农民改良农业生产技术，今年超过应产量三百四十石。该村共有地二千三百五十七亩，应产量为一百六十三石，实收粮二千五百零三石。超过应产量的原因，除农民认识了土改生产政策安心生产外，曹林水的积极带头领导，起了相当作用。主要表现在：（一）积极提高生产技术。曹林水自一九四六年参加了太行第二届群英大会后，吸取了石寸金的精耕细作、多上肥的经验，去年便联络了本村有农业技术的农民，组织了农业技术研究会，在每个生产季节中，作实地的试验。他首先把自己几亩不大好的地多上了肥，今年一亩本地麦打了一石四斗，二亩“一六九”麦打了二石五，打破了部分群众认为“坏地多上肥也是白搭”的想法，使群众认识了不管什么地只要多上肥就能多打粮，这样推动了全村群众多上肥。去年夏天，技术研究会推动了农民选麦种，今年其他地区“一六九”麦差不多都生了黄疸，产量降低；但他村“一六九”麦没有黄疸，每亩收九斗一升五合。这样推动全村群众今年夏、秋两季普遍选了种。（二）曹林水吸收了石寸金和李顺达的消毒浸种办法后，便组织农民进行浸种和精耕细作。今年该村正茬麦地差不多都犁了三遍，改茬麦地耕一遍耙二遍，秋地普遍垡完。（三）指导农民什么地上什么肥，什么地种什么庄稼。今年春耕时，曹林水便召集农业技术委员会，研究怎样上肥和播种。研究后，便发动大家在阳坡地多上大肥和猪肥，底洼地和背阴地应上羊肥、圈肥和油饼。高地应种毛黄谷（熟时不怕风），和“一六九”麦，沟地和洼地应种“母鸡嘴”和“大白谷”，这样庄稼格外长的好，粒大饱满。（四）他以整顿本互助组为例，认真实行等价变工、按活记工，推动群众同样做。他为了领导本村群众开展冬季生产，曾召开全村群众大会；根据本村实际情况，制订切实的冬季生产计划。在农业方面：争取明年每亩秋地上九十担粪。肥的来源，除现已有的各种肥料能上七百一十亩外，还缺八百四十五亩地的肥。计划再从油坊赚饼、薰肥、挖池土、出圈土等来解决。在副业方面：计划组织牲口、人力搞运销，争取收入六万元（新币、下同）。要求现有的油坊、豆腐坊今冬争取收入十一万元。并计划今年增加十头牲口，建立苗圃七分，要求明年每人栽活两棵树。（霍次孟、李秀卿、裴成业、李成全、马保香）
