　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 15th: TASS reports: It has been seven years since the Soviet army launched a powerful counter-offensive near Moscow in early December 1941, causing the Hitlerite army to suffer a devastating defeat. In an article entitled "The Great Victory at Moscow" published in *Pravda* on the 6th, Major General of the Army Talensky wrote: Under the most difficult circumstances, the Soviet army shattered the offensive of a powerful and ferocious enemy, not only defeating the enemy's main force but also destroying the enemy's operational system, which they considered foolproof. The author pointed out that imperialist countries can build large armies and equip them on a large scale with modern technology, but in wars of aggression and conquest, they can never arouse the spiritual strength of the army and the people, they can never establish a solid and unified rear area necessary for victory, and they can never arouse the creative and organizational abilities of all their personnel. Therefore, so many one-sided theories of modern warfare that have emerged in imperialist countries all lead to the same conclusion, namely, to strive to win the war in the shortest possible time. These "blitzkrieg" theories, even if specifically manifested as the "standard" German "blitzkrieg," "tank warfare," or "air force warfare," ultimately, or even the "atomic warfare" advocated by contemporary American military theorists—are all of the same nature. History has ruthlessly proven that if the entire people are not united under the great will to fight for victory, and if the power of the people is not united, there is no hope of victory in modern warfare. This is especially true in a war of aggression against the most progressive socialist country. The author concludes that the victory in the battle near Moscow was the first undeniable proof of the great power of the Soviet social and state system, the Soviet armed forces, and Stalin's military science. The battle near Moscow made people see at that time that the banner of victory that would later fly over Berlin and the ruins of fascist Germany had begun to rise.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 15th: TASS, Moscow: The Frunze Military Academy, the largest military science institution in the Soviet Union, celebrated its 30th anniversary on December 8th. In recognition of the academy's outstanding contributions to training personnel for the Soviet armed forces and developing Soviet military art, the Soviet government awarded it the Order of Lenin, the Order of the Red Banner, and the First Class Order of Suvorov as a commendation.

　　The Frunze Military Academy was founded in 1918, one year after the October Revolution, on the recommendation of Lenin. For thirty years, it has trained many highly educated officers and generals for the Soviet armed forces. Many outstanding strategists and army commanders in the Soviet Union are graduates of the academy. Among its first students was the Civil War hero Chapayev. Soviet Marshals Konev, Govorov, Meretskov, Sokolovsky, Budyonny, and Malinovsky are also graduates of the Frunze Academy. During the Great Patriotic War, the Supreme Commander of the Soviet Armed Forces often praised in his orders the Frunze Academy graduates who commanded the meritorious troops. The academy is currently studying the experiences and lessons of the Great Patriotic War. Its students include veterans of many battles, about one hundred of whom are Heroes of the Soviet Union.

### 真理报著文纪念莫斯科战役　帝国主义侵略战争　最后必然注定失败

　　真理报著文纪念莫斯科战役
  　帝国主义侵略战争
  　最后必然注定失败
    【新华社陕北十五日电】塔斯社讯：自从一九四一年十二月初苏军在莫斯科新近转入强大的反攻并使希特勒军队开始遭受溃灭性的失败以来，迄今已有七年。塔伦斯基陆军少将六日在真理报上以“在莫斯科的伟大胜利”为题著文称：苏军在最困难的情况下，粉碎了强大而凶恶的敌人的攻势，不但击溃了敌人的主力，而且也摧毁了敌人认为万无一失的作战体系。作者指出：帝国主义国家可以建立庞大的军队，并大规模地以现代化的技术加以装备，但在侵略与征伐的战争中，它绝不能激起军队与人民的精神力量，它绝不能建立起为胜利所必需的稳固而统一的后方，而且也绝不能激起其全部人员的创造与组织的能力。因此，各帝国主义国家曾经出现的那样多的现代战争的片面理论，都得到一个相同的结论，即力求在尽可能短的时间内赢得战争的胜利。这些“闪电战”理论，即令具体表现为“标准的”德国“闪电战”、“战车战”或“空军战”，最后或者即令是当代美国军事理论家们所宣传的“原子战”——其性质都是相同的。历史已铁面无情地证明了：如果全体人民不是团结在争取胜利的伟大意志之下，如果人民的力量没有被团结起来的话，就休想在现代战争中胜利。在侵略最进步之社会主义国家的战争中尤其如此。作者结语称，莫斯科附近战役的胜利，是对苏维埃社会及国家体制、对苏维埃武装部队及斯大林军事科学之伟大力量的第一个无可争辩的证明。莫斯科近郊的战役，当时已使人看到，那一面日后在柏林、在法西斯德国的废墟上空飘扬的胜利旗帜已开始上升了。
    【新华社陕北十五日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联最大的军事科学学府——福龙芝军事学院于十二月八日庆祝其成立的三十周年纪念。因该学院在为苏联武装部队训练人员及发展苏维埃军事艺术方面，功勋卓著，苏联政府特授予列宁勋章、红旗勋章与一级苏沃洛夫勋章，以示褒奖。
    福龙芝军事学院，是十月革命后的一年即一九一八年，在列宁的建议下创立的。三十年来，它已为苏联武装部队训练了许多极有教养的军官与将军。苏联许多卓越的战略家与陆军司令员，都是从该学院毕业的。它的第一批学生中，有内战英雄夏伯阳。苏联元帅科涅夫、戈沃洛夫、米列茨科夫、索柯洛夫斯基、布琼尼、马林诺夫斯基等，也是福龙芝学院的毕业生。在伟大的爱国战争中，苏联武装部队最高统帅时常在其命令中褒奖那些统率着功勋卓著的部队的福龙芝学院毕业生。该院目前正在研究伟大爱国战争中的经验教训。它的学生中有久经战阵的军人，其中约一百人是苏联英雄。
