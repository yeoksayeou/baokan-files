　　Bandit Huang Wei Corps Entirely Surrounded - 110th Division Uprising on the Battlefield
    [Xinhua News Agency, Huaihai Front, 1st] The Huang Wei Corps, which Chiang Kai-shek hurriedly dispatched from southern Henan to reinforce the Xuzhou front, has been completely surrounded by the People's Liberation Army in a small area between the Huai River and the Fei River southwest of Suxian. After more than twenty days of long march, the unit had just arrived in the Nanpingji, Sunyi, Baisha, and Caoshi areas, more than thirty miles southwest of Suxian, on the 24th, when it was surrounded on all sides by powerful People's Liberation Army forces. After several days of fierce artillery bombardment by the People's Liberation Army, the enemy suffered extremely heavy casualties. The enemy had made several attempts to break through in a southeasterly direction, attempting to link up with the Li Yannian and Liu Ruming corps advancing north from the Bengbu area, but all failed. Part of the breakout force was annihilated. After the Li Yannian and Liu Ruming corps advanced to the Renqiao and Guzhen areas southeast of Suxian, they abandoned the Huang Wei corps out of fear of being annihilated and turned back to Bengbu. The line north of Bengbu, including Renqiao, Guzhen, and Caolaoji, is now under our army's control. Under these circumstances, the Huang Wei Corps has been completely trapped in a desperate situation. This army of about 100,000 men has now been compressed into a small area of fifteen li from east to west and five li from north to south, centered on Shuangduiji, including Xuzhuang, Qianhou Zhouzhuang. Food and ammunition are extremely scarce. After eating all the pigs, chickens, and dogs of the residents, they can only rely on slaughtering mules and horses and robbing the residents of sweet potatoes and sweet potato vines for food. The food airdropped by aircraft is very limited, and is mainly dropped to Hu Lian's 18th Army, while the 10th, 14th, and 15th Armies receive very little. Officers and soldiers often kill each other in order to抢夺空投食物(compete for airdropped food). Because of the lack of drinking water, they can only drink mud, and because there are no houses to live in, they can only camp in the freezing cold, crowded together with piles of corpses, wounded soldiers, vehicles, and livestock. They are frozen, hungry, thirsty, tired, and in a miserable state. Every time the People's Liberation Army fires a shell, it kills part of the enemy. The People's Liberation Army is now urging the unit to surrender. If they do not surrender, they will be resolutely annihilated.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Huaihai Front, 1st] The 110th Division of the Kuomintang army Huang Wei Corps, which was surrounded southwest of Suxian, staged an uprising on the battlefield at Luoji, southwest of Suxian, on November 29th, led by General Liao Yunzhou, the division commander. It has now been transferred to a certain place in the rear for rest and reorganization, and has been warmly welcomed by the People's Liberation Army and the local people along the way. The 85th Army is Chiang Kai-shek's direct line troops, and the 110th Division is the main force of the 85th Army. The uprising of this division pointed out a bright path that should be taken by other direct line troops of the Kuomintang bandit army, especially the Huang Wei Corps, which is tightly surrounded by us.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Huaihai Front, 1st] After the uprising of the 110th Division of the Kuomintang direct line 85th Army, led by General Liao Yunzhou, the leaders of the Central Plains and East China People's Liberation Army sent a special telegram to General Liao and all officers and soldiers of the division to express their congratulations. The original telegram is as follows:
    Comrade Division Commander Yunzhou Liao and all officers and soldiers of the 110th Division: Your uprising on the battlefield on November 29th to join the People's Liberation Army is entirely in the interests of the country and the people. You have pointed out a bright path to the Huang Wei Corps and other Chiang armies that are being surrounded and annihilated. Your actions will surely be welcomed by the people of the whole country. We hereby send a telegram to congratulate you.

　　匪黄维兵团全部被围一一零师战场起义
    【新华社淮海前线一日电】蒋介石由豫南急急忙忙调来增援徐州前线的黄维兵团，已被人民解放军团团包围在宿县西南淮河与淝河中间的狭小地区内。该部经过二十余天的长途行军，二十四日刚至宿县西南三十余里的南平集、孙仪、白沙、曹市地区，即遭强大的解放军四面包围。经解放军数日猛烈炮轰，伤亡极大。该敌曾数次向东南方向突围，企图与蚌埠地区北上策应的李延年、刘汝明两兵团会合，均告失败。其突围部队的一部，并被消灭。李延年、刘汝明两兵团进至宿县东南任桥、固镇地区后，因害怕被歼，亦弃黄维兵团于不顾，掉头逃回蚌埠。现蚌埠以北任桥、固镇、曹老集一线已被我军控制。在此情况下，黄维兵团已完全陷入绝境。这支约十万人的军队现已被压缩在以双堆集为中心的许庄、前后周庄东西十五里，南北五里的狭小地区内，粮草弹药，极端缺乏。在将居民的猪、鸡、狗吃光后，仅赖宰杀骡马及抢劫居民的红薯和红薯藤叶为食。飞机空投粮食极少，且专投给其十八军胡琏部，十军、十四军、十五军所得甚少。官兵为抢夺空投食物，往往互击致死。因为缺少饮水，只能喝泥浆，没有房屋住，只能在大冻天露营，和大堆的死尸、伤兵、车辆、牲口，挤成一团。又冻又饿又渴又累，狼狈不堪。解放军每发出一个炮弹，都要打死该敌一部。现解放军正劝该部投降，如不投降，则坚决歼灭之。
    【新华社淮海前线一日电】被围于宿县西南的国民党军黄维兵团之八十五军一一零师，于十一月二十九日由师长廖运周将军率领，在宿县西南之罗集举行战场起义。现已开至后方某地休整，沿途受到人民解放军及当地人民之热烈欢迎。按八十五军为蒋介石嫡系部队，而一一零师则为八十五军之主力。该师的起义，给国民党匪军其他嫡系部队特别是被我紧紧包围之黄维兵团指出了一条应走的光明大道。
    【新华社淮海前线一日电】国民党嫡系之八十五军一一零师在师长廖运周将军率领起义后，中原及华东人民解放军首长特电廖将军及全师官兵致贺，原电如下：
    廖师长运周并转一一零师全体官兵同志们：你们于十一月二十九日在战场起义，加入人民解放军，完全符合国家人民的利益。你们向正被包围歼灭的黄维兵团和其他蒋军部队，指出了一条光明大道。你们的行动，必为全国人民所欢迎。特电祝贺。
    刘伯承、邓小平、陈毅、粟裕、谭震林、陈赓、谢富治
