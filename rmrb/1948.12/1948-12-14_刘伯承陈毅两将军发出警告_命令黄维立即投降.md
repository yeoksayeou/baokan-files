Xinhua News Agency, Huaihai Front, December 12th—Generals Liu Bocheng, Commander of the Central Plains Field Army of the People's Liberation Army, and Chen Yi, Commander of the East China Field Army, have issued an order to General Huang Wei, Commander of the Kuomintang Army's 12th Army Corps, ordering him to surrender immediately. The order is as follows:

General Huang Wei:

Currently, the majority of the four armies under your command have already been annihilated. The 85th Army, with the exception of a few personnel from the army headquarters, has been completely wiped out. The 14th Army has no more than two thousand men remaining, and the 10th Army has already been annihilated by more than two-thirds. Even the 18th Army, the ace unit you rely on, has suffered over half casualties. The complete annihilation of your entire army corps is only a matter of days. Furthermore, the reinforcements you were hoping for, Sun Yuanliang's army corps, have been completely annihilated. The Qiu Qingquan and Li Mi army corps are already heavily besieged, suffering heavy losses, and are struggling to protect themselves; their annihilation is inevitable. The Li Yannian army corps is being blocked by our army and is still over eighty miles away, unable to advance an inch and suffering heavy casualties.

Under these circumstances, any further desperate resistance by you and your subordinates will not only lead to nowhere but will also result in complete destruction under the intense artillery fire of the People's Liberation Army. As the commander of an army corps, you should cherish your subordinates and their lives, immediately lay down your weapons, and no longer allow your officers and soldiers to make meaningless sacrifices. If you accept this final warning from us, please send representatives to our headquarters immediately to negotiate the terms of surrender. Time is of the essence, and we urge you to make a decision promptly.

Liu Bocheng, Chen Yi

    刘伯承陈毅两将军发出警告
    命令黄维立即投降
    【新华社淮海前线十二日电】人民解放军中原野战军司令员刘伯承将军、华东野战军司令员陈毅将军，顷对国民党军十二兵团司令官黄维将军发出命令，令其立即投降。命令如下：黄维将军：现在你所属的四个军，业已大部被歼。八十五军除军部少数人员外，已全部覆灭。十四军所属不过两千人，十军业已被歼三分之二以上。就是你所依靠的王牌十八军，亦已被歼过半。你的整个兵团，全部歼灭，只是几天的事。而你所希望的援兵孙元良兵团，业已全歼，邱清泉、李弥两兵团业已陷入重围，损失惨重，自身难保，必被歼灭。李延年兵团被我军阻击，尚在八十里以外，寸步难移且伤亡惨重。在这种情况下，你本人和你的部属，再作绝望的抵抗，不但没有丝毫出路，只能在人民解放军的强烈炮火下完全毁灭。贵官身为兵团司令，应爱惜部属与生命，立即放下武器，不再让你的官兵作无谓牺牲。如果你接受我们这一最后警告，请即派代表到本部谈判投降条件。时机紧迫，望即决策。
            刘伯承、陈毅
        一九四八年十二月十二日
