　　Fucheng Eliminates Hidden Bandits
  　Social Order Stabilized
    [Ji Lu Yu Telegraph] After Fucheng County systematically suppressed hidden bandits, rural order has become stable. To eradicate hidden bandits, the county organized a unified bandit suppression committee, with the county cadre corps, county government, and public security bureau respectively responsible for military command, policy propaganda, and interrogation and handling. The approach taken was to divide the entire county into three key areas, carrying out suppression purposefully and step by step. A repentance center for puppet bandit personnel was established in Liukou Town, calling for and setting a deadline for repentance. This suppression lasted ten days and achieved great results. (1) It widely publicized the current situation and our party's policies, stabilizing people's hearts and social order. (2) Hidden puppet bandits were uncovered, including Zhong Jian Shen, secretary of the puppet Henan Provincial Government, and Sun Wu, a puppet bandit leader, as well as two company commanders and over fifty squad leaders and below. Thirty-two people repented voluntarily. Furthermore, under the impact of our power, bandit Liu Xixuan led his subordinates, numbering over fifty, to surrender. Confiscated weapons included ninety-two rifles, eight Mauser pistols, four submachine guns, and two mortars. Since then, there have been no traces of bandits in Fucheng County, and social order is becoming increasingly stable.
