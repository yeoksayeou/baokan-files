International Briefs

    △ On December 9th, the London Trades Council, representing 650,000 workers, instructed its executive committee to convene a meeting to organize a "Defend Peace" movement. The council's resolution stated that they firmly believe that "the working people of all countries do not want another war."
    △ Poland and Norway signed a trade agreement on December 1st, stipulating that the total trade volume between the two countries in 1949 will be $35 million, which is 10% more than the trade volume in this year's trade agreement.
    △ A Polish military delegation headed by Defense Minister Marshal Zymierski arrived in Prague, Czechoslovakia on the morning of the 9th, and was welcomed by Czech Defense Minister Svoboda.
    △ Newfoundland, formerly a British colony in the Americas, has been incorporated into Canada. The merger agreement was officially signed on the 11th of this month. Newfoundland covers an area of 110,000 square kilometers, has a population of 300,000, and is located in the Atlantic Ocean east of Canada.
    △ TASS Rome, December 8th: Italian Socialist Party leader Nenni told the press that the Italian government's guarantee during the parliamentary debate on foreign policy that "Italy has not participated in the Brussels Treaty" is of no practical value because Italy has already become a member of the US-British military and political system. This is the only conclusion that can be drawn from the speeches made by Gasperi and Sforza in parliament. The reason why Italy has not yet joined the Brussels Treaty is simply because Western countries prefer to tie it to a "Mediterranean Pact" together with Greece and Spain. Nenni emphasized that the opposition parties will bring the discussion of foreign affairs to the Italian masses. Nenni also said that the whole country has been closely watching the parliamentary debates, and the Socialist Party's proposal opposing the government's policies and advocating peace has received the support of thousands of citizens. I have submitted hundreds of telegrams, letters, and resolutions from various mass organizations expressing their support to the Speaker of the Parliament.
    △ Soviet Commander-in-Chief of the occupying forces in Austria, Kurassov, pointed out at a regular meeting of the Allied Council for Austria on December 10th that in July 1947, the Austrian government signed an electricity exchange agreement with the US authorities in Germany; later, it signed a trade agreement worth £130,000 with the British authorities in Germany; and finally, in August 1948, it concluded a trade agreement with the British-American Joint Occupation Zone in Germany. The US and British sides had not notified the Control Council or obtained its approval for any of these matters, and the Austrian authorities had not notified or obtained the approval of parliament either. Based on the regulations stipulating that the four Allied powers jointly control Austria and that the control mechanism is separate from Germany, Kurassov lodged a firm protest against this crude violation of the foundations of the Allied policy towards Austria.

　　国际简讯
    △十二月九日，代表六十五万工人的伦敦工会委员会，指示其执委会召开会议，以组织“保卫和平”运动。会委员会的决议说，他们深信“一切国家的工老百姓都不愿有另一次战争”。
    △波兰与挪威于十二月一日签订贸易协定，规定两国一九四九年贸易总额为三千五百万美元，较今年贸易协定的贸易量多百分之十。
    △以国防部长齐墨尔斯基元帅为首的波兰军事代表团，九日晨抵达捷京布拉格，捷国防部长斯沃波达前往欢迎。
    △原美洲英属殖民地纽芬兰已并入加拿大，合并协定于本月十一日正式签字。纽芬兰面积十一万方公里，人口三十万人，在加拿大之东的大西洋中。
    △塔斯社罗马八日讯：意大利社会党领袖南尼顷向报界谈称：意大利政府在议会辩论外交政策时所作的“意大利并未参加布鲁塞尔公约”的保证，是没有实际价值的，因为意大利业已成为美英军事政治体系中的一员。这是从加斯员利和史佛卓在议会发表的演说中可能得出的唯一结论。意大利之所以迄今仍未参加布鲁塞尔公约，只是因为西方国家宁愿把它与希腊、西班牙一同束缚到“地中海公约”中去。南尼强调称：反对党派将把外交事务的讨论带到意大利群众中去。南尼并称：全国都曾密切注视议会的辩论，社会党反对政府政策而主张和平的议案，获得了数以千计的公民的支持。我曾向议会议长递交数百封各种群众团体表示支持的电报、信件和决议。
    △苏联驻奥地利占领军总司令库拉索夫，十二月十日在盟国对奥管制委员会例会上指出：一九四七年七月，奥地利政府与德境美当局签订了电力交换协定；后来，又与德境英当局签订了十三万镑的贸易协定；最后，在一九四八年八月，又与德境英美联合占领区缔结了贸易协定。所有这些事情，美、英方面都没有通知管委会或得到管委会的允准，奥国当局也是没有通知议会和得到议会的允准。库拉索夫根据规定四盟国共同管制奥地利与德国分立的管制机构，对于这种粗暴地破坏盟国对奥政策之基础的情事提出坚决抗议。　　　　　　　【新华社】
