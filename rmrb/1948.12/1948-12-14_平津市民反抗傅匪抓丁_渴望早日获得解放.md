Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, December 9th: According to newspapers in Beijing and Tianjin, and reports from foreign news agencies, the dying Fu Zuoyi bandit gang's plan to frantically conscript men in Beijing and Tianjin to make up for its troop shortages has met with strong resistance from the citizens of Beijing and Tianjin. The Fu bandits planned to conscript 10,000 men each in Beijing and Tianjin. Upon hearing this, citizens fled in droves, and many company clerks and shop assistants disappeared overnight to avoid conscription. As a result, when conscription lottery was held in Tianjin on the 19th of last month, only a handful of people showed up. As for the so-called "volunteer soldiers," only 29 people had enlisted by the 23rd of last month. Seeing that the citizens were unwilling to die for him, the Fu bandit is using barbaric methods to detain the families of many who have evaded "military service," and is going door-to-door in Tianjin to demand their surrender, and arresting people in the dark in Beijing, tying them up with ropes, loading them onto trucks, and transporting them away. The arrested family members are weeping and wailing, and the city is filled with panic. The Fu bandit is also using "military service brokers" to force citizens to spend money to buy conscripts, and the price of each conscript has risen to 60 to 80 bags of flour.

The citizens of Beiping, persecuted by the Fu bandit's tyranny, are eagerly awaiting liberation. According to an Associated Press dispatch from Beiping on the 4th, the citizens of Beiping are "waiting with very secret concern" for the People's Liberation Army, and they are talking about "when the Liberation Army will arrive."

    平津市民反抗傅匪抓丁
    渴望早日获得解放
    【新华社陕北九日电】据平、津报纸及外国通讯社消息：垂死的傅作义匪帮在平、津疯狂抓丁弥补其兵力不足的计划，已遭到平、津市民有力反抗。傅匪计划在平、津两地各抓丁一万名。市民闻悉，纷纷逃避，许多公司店员一夜之间即消失，逃避征兵去了。因此，上月十九日天津举行壮丁抽签时，前往抽签者寥寥可数。而所谓“志愿兵”的征募，至上月二十三日亦只有二十九名应征。傅匪看到市民不愿为其卖命，正以野蛮手段将许多逃避“兵役”的家属扣押，并在天津挨户催索，在北平黑夜捕人，抓得后用绳索捆绑装上汽车运走。被抓的家属痛哭哀号，市面人心惶惶。傅匪并利用“兵役贩子”强迫市民出钱收买壮丁，壮丁价格每名已涨至六十袋至八十袋面粉。
    在傅匪暴政迫害下的北平市民，正渴望早日获得解放。据美联社北平四日电透露：北平市民以“非常隐秘的关切等待着”解放军，他们谈论着解放军“将在什么时候到来”。
