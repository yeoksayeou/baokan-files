Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 9th (For reference by all liberated areas) The Shandong Provincial Government's Provisional Measures for Protecting and Rewarding Afforestation:

(1) These measures are formulated to protect and reward afforestation.

(2) Based on the provisions of Article 9, Item B of the Outline Land Law, the following mountains, forests, and closed-off mountains shall be taken over by governments at all levels for separate management:
	(1) Large forests shall be directly managed by the Provincial Government or entrusted to the administrative offices for management.
	(2) All county public forests, "closed-off mountains," and "public forests" originally within the county's boundaries shall be managed by the county government.
	(3) All "closed-off mountains," "forests," community land, and temple land forests originally within the scope of a village shall be managed by the village government.
	(4) Trees planted on both sides of important rivers (such as the Yellow River) and highways and railways to consolidate embankments and roadbeds shall be managed by the respective river affairs bureaus, highway bureaus, and railway bureaus.

(3) For all forests and mountain areas that have been assigned to governments at all levels for management, the managing authorities shall report the forest and mountain area conditions, area, boundaries, and management methods to the superior government for the record and issue a public notice to strictly protect them. Forests privately owned by the masses shall also be protected by law.

(4) Public forests must establish a specific management organization, formulate management methods, and earnestly take responsibility for protection and cultivation, including timely sowing, planting, pruning, and harvesting. The government shall reward and support the development of mountain forests distributed to the masses.

(5) Public forest land and closed-off mountains are only allowed for afforestation and not for reclamation. If reclamation is necessary, public forest land must be approved by the Provincial Government or the Administrative Office.

(6) For barren mountains and river beaches with undetermined ownership, if the masses voluntarily engage in afforestation, they shall be registered and approved by the government above the county level or the competent authority. The planted trees shall belong to the masses, but the land ownership shall still belong to the government.

(7) Trees planted by government agencies and organizations on private land shall belong to the owner of the land. If planted on public land without declaration and registration with the local government, they shall be publicly owned. If the public land has been distributed to the masses, the planted trees shall also be transferred with the land.

(8) Regardless of public or private mountains, forests, and trees, no government agency, military unit, organization, or individual may harvest them without the consent of the management authority or the forest owner. If harvesting is necessary, the management authority must specify the harvesting method for public forests, and the consent of the forest owner must be obtained for private forests. Fair prices must be given for both public and private forests, and forced harvesting is prohibited. Violators shall be punished according to law.

(9) To prevent forest fires, burning weeds is strictly prohibited. Those who intentionally set fires causing disasters shall be punished according to law.

(10) When closing off mountains for afforestation, a certain mountain area must be designated to facilitate grazing livestock by the masses.

(11) Those who violate government laws and afforestation covenants by unauthorized felling, stealing of forest trees, or releasing livestock to damage forest trees shall be ordered to compensate for the losses, and those who intentionally destroy them shall be severely punished.

(12) Those who engage in afforestation on public or private land and occupy the land for less than ten years may be exempted from levies. Public land occupied by nurseries and protection forests (such as windbreak forests) shall be exempted from levies.

(13) The government shall reward those who have made significant achievements in protecting forest trees, cultivating seedlings, and introducing experiences to promote afforestation.

(14) Without conflicting with the principles of these measures, each region may formulate its own management methods and forest protection covenants.

(15) These measures shall be promulgated and implemented by the Shandong Provincial Government.
