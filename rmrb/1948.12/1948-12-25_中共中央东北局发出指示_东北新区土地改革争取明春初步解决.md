Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, December 23rd: The Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee issued instructions on land reform in the new areas in the middle of last month. The original text is as follows:

(1) The Northeast has been completely liberated. Due to the influence of land reform in the basic areas, especially the recent victories of our army, the basic masses in all newly recovered areas west of Jinzhou and around Shenyang and Changchun, and the new areas in Rehe that we can consolidate, have demands for land distribution and fewer concerns. Landlords and rich peasants may reduce their resistance due to the general trend, and some of them have even expressed that it is better to distribute land sooner rather than later. Objectively, the conditions for implementing land reform this winter are in place. As long as the provinces can transfer cadres who are both quantitatively and qualitatively capable of directing local land reform work, these areas should be included in the scope of land reform work this winter. If we can strive to preliminarily resolve the land reform issue in the new areas and the difficulties of the masses in terms of livestock and food grain before the spring plowing next year, it will be of great benefit to organizing and carrying out production campaigns next year.

(2) In order to ensure the success of land reform in the new areas, the provinces should immediately carry out two tasks: First, eliminating local bandits and scattered remnants is one of the prerequisites for land reform. To this end, the provinces and military regions must designate troops to conduct military suppression in conjunction with political disintegration and the masses' struggle against traitors, spies, and local bullies, and eliminate all organized bandits and scattered remnants within their jurisdiction within a time limit. All scattered soldiers and vagrants must be quickly gathered and accommodated at designated locations to stabilize social order, reduce destruction, and transition to land reform. Second, each province is responsible for continuing to transfer a large number of new and old cadres from the basic areas for short-term training, so that they can understand the policies, learn to classify classes, and participate in land reform in the new areas.

		Stabilize Social Order; Eliminate Local Bandits and Scattered Remnants

(3) Since the new areas have suffered severe war damage, and the area near Shenyang is also suffering from a severe famine, land reform must be combined with disaster relief and the organization of winter production. In land reform, we must pay close attention to solving the difficulties of farmers in next year's production, strictly prohibit extravagant eating and drinking, and avoid all waste and destructive phenomena, so as to be better prepared to get through next spring's famine and not delay spring plowing. Repeatedly explain to cadres and farmers that the direct purpose of land reform is to develop production. In areas where horses have been greatly reduced or died due to war and famine, special attention should be paid to organizing farmers to purchase a large number of horses from horse-producing areas with part of the fruits of land reform for next year's spring plowing. In terms of policy, it should be determined that the total area of ​​attack should not exceed 10% of the population. After confiscating the land and property of large and medium landlords and evil rich peasants, they should be given the same share according to the principle of equal distribution, giving them a way to make a living. Small landlords and old rich peasants should only have their excess land, draught animals, farm tools, and grain confiscated. Under no circumstances should hidden wealth be dug up or people be driven out of their courtyards. Tenant rich peasants can have their surplus livestock confiscated after they obtain land, and everything else will be treated as well-to-do middle peasants. Under no circumstances should middle peasants (including well-to-do middle peasants) be infringed upon, and middle peasants who lack land and draught animals should be given their due share. Hitting people is prohibited. Except for special agents, traitors, bullies, and feudal leaders, no one should be detained arbitrarily. Individual cases where those who have committed heinous crimes must be executed must be approved by the county government and the provincial government before they can be carried out. Under no circumstances should industry and commerce (including the industry and commerce of landlords and rich peasants) be struggled against.

		Establish Democratic Power; Cultivate Activists

(4) Leading comrades of the provincial committees must personally take charge of land reform in the new areas. In terms of methods, the mobilization of peasants from the bottom up and the government's decrees from the top down can be combined. Whenever a work team arrives in an area, it should absorb local poor and hired peasants who work hard and suffer a lot in large numbers through short-term training courses and apprenticeships, and cultivate and train them in their work to become activists and leading backbones of local land reform. At the same time, during land reform, attention should be paid to establishing people's representative conferences at the district and village levels on the basis of organizing poor peasant leagues and peasant associations (the district and village people's representative conferences in the new areas are different from those in the basic areas; landlords and rich peasants have no right to vote). After these people's representative conferences are established, they should become the highest power organs in the local area to completely destroy the old feudal ruling structure. And in the struggle of land reform, carefully and individually absorb the poor and hired peasants and workers who have true class consciousness, a clear history, active struggle, and are of upright style into the Party.

(5) Regarding the correction of deviations, the issuance of land certificates, and the adjustment of land work in the basic and semi-old areas, all localities can handle them according to the spirit of the Xinhua News Agency's editorial on November 10, "In places where land reform has ended, correcting leftism must prevent rightism."

### 中共中央东北局发出指示　东北新区土地改革争取明春初步解决

　　中共中央东北局发出指示
    东北新区土地改革争取明春初步解决
    【新华社哈尔滨二十三日电】中共中央东北局于上月中旬发出对新区土地改革的指示。原文如下：
    （一）东北已全部解放，锦州以西、沈阳长春周围之一切新收复区，及热河我可巩固的新区，由于受基本区土地改革的影响，特别是最近我军胜利的影响，这些新区的基本群众，已有分配土地的要求，顾虑较少；地主富农因大势所趋，抵抗亦可能减少，甚至其中一部分人，已表示迟分不如早分。客观上已具备在今冬实行土地改革的条件。只要各省能够抽调出在数量和质量上，都能掌握当地进行土地改革工作的干部，则这些地区应即列入今冬土地改革工作的范围。如果我们能争取在明年春耕前，将新区土地改革问题及群众所需的牲畜、吃粮等困难初步解决，则对明年组织和开展生产运动，会有极大的好处。
    （二）为了使新区土地改革搞好，各省应立即首先进行两件事情：一、肃清土顽散匪是土地改革的先决条件之一。为此，各省各军区必须指定部队，结合政治瓦解与群众的反奸反特反恶霸的斗争进行军事清剿，将辖区内所有成股土顽散匪限期肃清。对一切散兵游勇，务必迅速分别指定地点集中收容，以稳定社会秩序，减少破坏，而过渡到土地改革。二、各省自己负责继续在基本区抽调大批新、老干部，进行短期训练，使之弄清政策，学会划分阶级，参加新区土地改革。
    　　　　稳定社会秩序　肃清土顽散匪
    （三）由于新区已遭受严重的战争破坏，沈阳附近又是严重的灾荒，因此必须与救济灾荒，组织冬季生产相结合进行土地改革。在土地改革中必须认真注意解决农民明年生产的困难，严禁大吃大喝，避免一切浪费与破坏现象，以便更有准备地渡过明年春荒，不误春耕生产。向干部及农民反复说明土地改革的直接目的就是发展生产。在因战争及灾荒以致马匹大量减少或死亡的地区，应特别注意用土地改革中的一部分果实，组织农民向产马地区购进大批马匹，以便明年春耕。在政策上，应确定掌握总的打击面不得超过人口的百分之十。大中地主、恶霸富农在没收其土地财产后，应按平分原则，分给其同样的一份，给予生活出路。小地主及旧富农，只征收其多的土地、耕畜、农具和粮食。一律不挖底财，不赶出大院。佃富农在其获得土地后，可征收其多余的牲口，其他均按富裕中农看待。中农（包括富裕中农）绝对不得侵犯，对缺少土地耕畜的中农，分给其应得的一份。禁止打人。除特务奸霸分子及封建头子外，不得乱加扣押。个别罪大恶极须处死者，必须经县政府通过、省政府批准后才能执行。绝对不得斗争工商业（包括地主富农的工商业）。
    　　　　建立民主政权　培养积极分子
    （四）新区土地改革，各省委负责同志必须亲自掌握。在方式方法上，可以采取自下而上的发动农民和自上而下之政府的法令相配合。工作团每到一地，即应以短期训练班和带徒弟的方式，大量吸收当地劳而又苦的贫雇农，在工作中培养和锻炼他们成为当地土地改革的积极分子和领导骨干。同时，土地改革中应注意在组织贫雇农团和农会的基础上，建立区村两级的人民代表会议（新区的区村人民代表会和基本区不同，地富分子一律无选举权）。这种人民代表会建立起来后，即应成为当地的最高权力机关，以彻底摧毁旧的封建的统机治构。并在土地改革斗争中，慎重地个别地吸收真正有阶级觉悟、历史清白、斗争积极、作风正派的贫雇农和工人入党。
    （五）关于基本区及半老区的纠正偏向、发土地证及调整土地工作，各地可根据新华社十一月十日“在结束土地改革的地方，纠左必须防右”的社论精神办理。
