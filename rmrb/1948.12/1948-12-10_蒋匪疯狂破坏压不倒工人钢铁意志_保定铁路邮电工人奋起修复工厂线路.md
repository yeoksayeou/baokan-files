　　Chiang Kai-shek Bandit's Frenzied Sabotage Cannot Suppress Workers' Iron Will
　　Baoding Railway and Postal Workers
　　Vigorously Repair Factories and Lines
　　[Baoding Electric] Postal, telecommunications, and railway workers in Baoding City are actively repairing machinery, lines, and public utilities that were destroyed by the Chiang Kai-shek and Fu Zuoyi bandit troops, striving to rebuild a new Baoding. Employees of the Municipal Postal Bureau resumed postal services on November 24th. In the past five days, a total of 890 letters have been mailed, with personal letters accounting for over 71%. Employees of the Municipal Telephone Bureau began inspecting city-wide lines on the 24th, and by the 28th, most of the city's lines had been repaired. The damage to suburban lines caused by the bandit troops was more severe, with 51 empty sections of the lead pipe line in Xiguan alone being destroyed. A single line has now been erected to facilitate communication. Employees of the Electric Light Company, which had been shut down for seven months and further damaged by Liu Fenghua's bandit troops, have also begun clearing the burned-down houses, picking out usable parts, wiping down machinery, repairing damaged lines, and rebuilding the factory. All old employees and workers in these enterprises, except for those involved in sabotage, have been reinstated to their original positions at their original salaries. After reporting for duty, Liu Dexin, director of the Baoding Station Telecommunications Office of the Pinghan Railway, directors of the transport and operations sections of the Transportation Department, and three deputy station masters of the Operations Department have also resumed their original duties. The Railway Management Committee established by the Military Control Commission has only sent out working groups to guide the work of each section. After listening to my explanation of the democratic government's policies, Director Liu Dexin said, "The Kuomintang told me to leave, but I didn't. Even if I went to Tianjin and Beiping, there would be no way out. I am willing to continue serving with you." Because the person in charge of the Electric Light Company had fled to Beiping, temporary heads of each section were elected by the employees, and Liu Qingsheng, the head of the power generation section, was publicly elected to be responsible for the overall work, and to repair the factory under the guidance of the personnel in charge of the Military Control Commission. During the Chiang Kai-shek bandit rule, workers' wages were in arrears and deducted, and their lives were extremely difficult. Now, each enterprise has prepared registers, and salaries will be paid according to the original salaries within days. The Railway Management Committee has also temporarily lent each person 10,000 yuan, and the workers' morale is very high. They overcame various difficulties and carried out reconstruction work. When the telephone bureau's outside line workers were repairing the lines from Nanguan to the city, work that originally required five people for a day was completed by three people in just over half a day.

　　蒋匪疯狂破坏压不倒工人钢铁意志
  　保定铁路邮电工人
    奋起修复工厂线路
    【保定电】保定市邮政、电讯、铁路工人等，正积极修复为蒋傅匪军破坏了的机器与线路及各公用事业，为重建新的保定而努力。市邮政局员工已于十一月二十四日开始通邮。五日来寄发出信件共八百九十件，内私人信件占百分之七十一强。市电话局职工于二十四日开始检查全城线路，至二十八日，市内线路已大部修复。市外被匪军破坏较重，仅西关铅管线即被毁五十一空，现已架单线，进行通话。已停工七月、又被刘匪化南破坏了的电灯公司的职工们，也已开始清理被焚毁的房舍，拣出能用的零件，擦机器，修理被破坏的线路，重建工厂。平汉路保定车站已有四百六十九名员工报到，并紧张的进行清理、保护器材车辆等工作。这些企业中的旧职员、工人，除破坏分子外，均原职原薪，照常供职录用。保定车站电讯事务所所长刘德新，运输段事务运务两股主任，运务段三个副站长等职员报到后，也都原职工作。军管会设立之铁路保管委员会，仅派出工作组，指导各段进行工作。刘德新所长听我讲解了民主政府的政策后说：“国民党叫我走我没走，到了平津，还是无出路，我愿和你们一起继续服务。”电灯公司因负责人已逃往北平，暂由职工推举了各股的临时负责人，并公推发电股长刘庆升负责全盘工作，在军管会主管人员指导下，修复工厂。工人在蒋匪统治时期，工资被拖欠扣押，生活极苦。现各企业已造具表册，日内即可按原薪发薪。铁路保管委员会并暂借给每人一万元，工人情绪十分高涨。他们克服了种种困难，进行重建工作。电话局外线工人在修复南关至城内线路时，原需五个人一天的工作，结果三个人半天多完成了。
