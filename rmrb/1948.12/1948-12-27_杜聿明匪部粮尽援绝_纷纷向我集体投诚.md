Xinhua News Agency, Huaihai Front, December 24th - Hunger is accelerating the demise of the remnant bandit troops of Du Yuming, besieged northeast of Yongcheng. According to captured bandit officers and soldiers, the daily food obtained by each unit from airdrops is less than one-third of the minimum requirement, averaging only enough for one meal of thin porridge. On the morning of the 17th, during a food drop, more than a dozen bandit soldiers were beaten to death and dozens injured due to collective food grabbing. It started raining on the night of the 19th, and continuous fog obscured the area, causing enemy planes to disappear. On the 20th, enemy planes did not come to airdrop due to the rain, and all bandit soldiers were completely without food for the entire day. Many bandit soldiers have been eating tree bark and grass roots; in some villages, even the tree bark and grass roots have been eaten clean. Bandit soldiers, unable to withstand the hunger, have been surrendering to the People's Liberation Army in droves for days. According to preliminary statistics, from the 15th to the 20th, the bandit troops surrendering collectively in units of platoons and companies already include one company and five platoons. These collectively surrendering bandit troops belong to the 96th Division, 42nd Division, 253rd Division, 39th Division, and other units. On the evening of the 16th, one platoon of the 126th Regiment of the enemy Li Qiang Corps' 42nd Division killed their platoon leader, who refused to surrender, and surrendered to the People's Liberation Army outpost at Lou Lou. On the evening of the 17th, Li Zhuang, deputy battalion commander of the 3rd Battalion of the 759th Regiment of the 253rd Division, led a company to surrender. On the 21st, the deputy commander of the enemy's "Suppression General Headquarters" Independent Regiment led eight people to surrender to the People's Liberation Army.

　　杜聿明匪部粮尽援绝
  　纷纷向我集体投诚
    【新华社淮海前线二十四日电】饥饿正加速使被围在永城东北杜聿明匪军残部的灭亡。据被俘的匪军官兵称：各部队现在每天由空投所得的粮食，不足最低需要的三分之一，平均仅够一餐稀饭之用。十七日晨投粮时，匪军因集体抢粮，有十几个人互殴致死，几十个人殴打成伤。十九日夜开始落雨，连日云雾迷＠，敌机绝迹。二十日敌机因天雨未来空投，匪军全体官兵一天完全没有吃东西。许多匪军已经吃树皮草根，在有些村庄，连树皮草根都吃光了。饿得受不住的匪军官兵，连日纷纷向解放军投诚。据初步统计：由十五日至二十日，匪军以连排为单位集体投诚者，已有一个连和五个排。这些集体投诚的匪军分属于九十六师、四十二师、二五三师、三十九师等部。十六日晚，敌李强兵团四十二师一二六团一个排，打死了拒绝投诚的排长，向卢楼解放军前哨阵地投诚。十七日晚，李庄率二五三师七五九团三营副营长率一个连投诚。二十一日敌“剿总”独立团副团长率八人向解放军投诚。
