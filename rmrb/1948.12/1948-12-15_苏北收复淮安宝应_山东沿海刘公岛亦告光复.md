Xinhua News Agency, East China, December 12th: Following the liberation of Huaiyin on the 3rd, the Northern Jiangsu People's Liberation Army recaptured Huai'an city on the 9th. The defending Kuomintang bandit troops of the Fourth Army's 90th Division, along with the 59th Division and the 41st Division of the 51st Army which escaped from Huaiyin, fled south. Currently, there are no enemies north of the line from Huai'an to Dongtai in northern Jiangsu Province. Huai'an and Huaiyin, collectively known as Lianghuai, are important military and commercial centers in northern Jiangsu. The recovery of Lianghuai has greatly changed the situation in the Northern Jiangsu Liberated Area.

It should be noted that Huaiyin, formerly the capital of the Suwan Border Region, formerly known as Qingjiangpu, has a population of approximately 70,000 and is located on both the north and south banks of the Grand Canal in northern Jiangsu. It has convenient transportation, and the famous Huaibei salt is distributed here. Huai'an is thirty miles southeast of Huaiyin, and the city is located on the east bank of the Grand Canal, with a population of approximately 100,000. Lianghuai was liberated from the hands of the Japanese puppet troops by the People's Liberation Army in September 1945, and was occupied by the Chiang bandit troops in September 1946.

Xinhua News Agency, East China, December 12th: After the liberation of Lianghuai (Huaiyin and Huai'an), the central cities of northern Jiangsu, the Northern Jiangsu Military Region was ordered to announce the establishment of the Lianghuai Military Control Commission and the Lianghuai Garrison Command, with Zhang Kai and Wu Jue as the Director and Deputy Director of the Military Control Commission, and Wen Fengshan as the Garrison Commander. They have now taken office and are performing their duties.

Xinhua News Agency, East China, December 13th: Following the recovery of Lianghuai (Huaiyin and Huai'an), the Northern Jiangsu People's Liberation Army recaptured Baoying city on the afternoon of the 9th. The defending enemy and the enemy fleeing from Lianghuai fled south together, and we are currently pursuing them. Now, of the seven county towns on the Northern Jiangsu Canal line, except for Gaoyou and Yangzhou, the remaining five cities, Suqian, Siyang, Huaiyin, Huai'an, and Baoying, have returned to the hands of the people.

Xinhua News Agency, East China, December 13th: Liugong Island, east of Weihaiwei, was recovered on the 9th. The Kuomintang bandit troops stranded on the island, under the threat of our army, fled by boat towards Tianjin at 9 pm on the 8th. Our Weihaiwei garrison and personnel from the democratic government have gone to the island to carry out work to reassure the people and rebuild the revolutionary order. It should be noted that Liugong Island was captured by the Kuomintang bandit troops on October 6th of last year.

Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains, December 13th: Under the influence of the unprecedented victory of the People's Liberation Army, Li Shihua, the captain of the Kuomintang Shaanxi South Shangxian Assault Brigade, along with Xu Hanyu, the head of Fuming Township in Shangxian County, led the entire brigade and all personnel of the township office, a total of more than 370 people, in an uprising in Majie Town, Shangxian County, on November 19th. They brought six light machine guns, more than forty pistols, and more than two hundred and twenty rifles. They broke through and repelled the blockade and pursuit of a regiment of the 27th Division of the Kuomintang bandit army, passed through more than 300 li of the Kuomintang-controlled area, and safely arrived in the Shaanxi South Liberated Area on November 29th. They were welcomed by the soldiers and civilians of the liberated area. It should be noted that Captain Li Shihua was originally a battalion commander in the old army of General Yang Hucheng of the Northwest Army. He was incorporated into the Kuomintang bandit army several times. Recently, the enemy incorporated the pseudo-local teams in the Shangluo Wanxi area, and Li's unit was reorganized into an assault brigade.

    苏北收复淮安宝应
    山东沿海刘公岛亦告光复
    【新华社华东十二日电】苏北解放军继三日解放淮阴后，又于九日收复淮安城。守敌国民党匪军第四军九十师，与从淮阴逃出之该军五十九师及五十一军四十一师全部南逃。现江苏省北部自淮安至东台一线以北已无敌人。淮安和淮阴合称两淮，为苏北重要的军事和商业中心。两淮的收复，使苏北解放区的形势大为改变。
    按淮阴为前苏皖边区首府，旧名青江浦，人口约七万，位于苏北运河中点的南北两岸。交通便利，著名的淮北盐即在此集散。淮安在淮阴东南三十里，城依运河东岸，人口约十万。两淮系于一九四五年九月被人民解放军自日伪军手中解放，而于一九四六年九月被蒋匪军所侵占。
    【新华社华东十二日电】苏北中心城市两淮（淮阴、淮安）解放后，苏北军区奉命宣布成立两淮军事管制委员会与两淮警备司令部，以张凯、吴觉为军管会正副主任委员，温凤山为警备司令，现已分别到职视事。
    【新华社华东十三日电】苏北解放军继收复两淮（淮阴、淮安）后，于九日下午收复宝应城。守敌与从两淮逃来之敌一起南逃，我正追击中。现苏北运河线上之七座县城除高邮、扬州外，其余宿迁、泗阳、淮阴、淮安、宝应等五城，均已重归人民手中。
    【新华社华东十三日电】威海卫以东的刘公岛已于九日收复。孤悬于该岛之国民党匪军，在我军威迫下，于八日晚九时乘船向天津方向逃窜。我威海卫驻军与民主政府人员已赴该岛进行安民与重建革命秩序工作。按刘公岛系去年十月六日被国民党匪军侵陷。
    【新华社中原十三日电】在人民解放军空前胜利影响下，国民党陕南商县突击大队大队长李世华偕同商县抚明乡乡长徐含毓，于十一月十九日率该大队全体官兵及乡公所全体人员共三百七十余人，在商县麻街镇起义。他们带来了轻机枪六挺，手枪四十多支，长枪二百二十余支。他们曾冲破与击退党民党匪军二十七师一个团的堵截与追击，通过国民党统治区三百余里，十一月二十九日安全达到陕南解放区。他们受到了解放区军民的欢迎。按李世华大队长原为西北军杨虎城将军旧部营长，先后被国民党匪军收编数次，最近敌收编商雒宛西一带伪地方团队，李部被改编为突击大队。
