Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 28th. The gold and silver rush in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, caused by the imminent fundamental collapse of Kuomintang rule and the sharp depreciation of counterfeit Gold Yuan, is continuing to develop in Shanghai, Hangzhou, Hankou and other places. According to foreign news agency reports: on the 23rd, as many as 100,000 people crowded in front of the Kuomintang Central Bank and the Bank of China in Shanghai to exchange for gold and silver, causing a riot on the spot, with nearly 100 people injured and seven killed by trampling. Until midnight, the crowds of people rushing to purchase continued to flow. In Hangzhou, Hankou, and other places, people were also trampled to death in "frantic rushes to purchase." The Kuomintang's China, Central, Communications, and Farmers Banks in the above-mentioned areas have been heavily guarded by Kuomintang military police and Flying Fortresses for many days, and many people rushing to purchase have been beaten and arrested. The Kuomintang Executive Yuan also announced a "suspension of cash redemption" on the 23rd, in an attempt to prevent the continued development of the rush to purchase.

After the Kuomintang government announced the suspension of cash redemption of gold and silver, the counterfeit Gold Yuan depreciated even more sharply. On the 24th, the black market price of gold in Shanghai had risen to 5,000 yuan per tael, which was 400 percent higher than the price of 1,000 yuan per tael stipulated in the "revised" currency reform measures. The US dollar rose to 96 yuan in Gold Yuan per dollar, which was an increase of 375 percent compared to the exchange rate of 1 to 20 stipulated in the "revised" currency reform measures. Rice rose from 350 yuan per shi on the 23rd to 500 yuan. Cotton goods rose by 50 percent in one day on the 24th, and some items even rose by 100 percent.

　　伪金圆券猛烈贬值
  　沪汉金银抢购风潮继续扩大
    【新华社陕北二十八日电】由于国民党统治即将根本垮台和伪金圆券的猛烈贬值所引起的国民党统治区金银抢购风潮，正在上海、杭州、汉口等地继续发展。据外国通讯社消息披露：二十三日上海国民党中央、中国等银行门前挤兑金银者即达十万人，当场发生骚动，近百人被压伤，有七人被压死。至午夜，挤购者仍川流不息。杭州、汉口等地亦有人在“疯狂的抢购”中被挤死。上述各地的国民党中国、中央、交通、农民四银行多日以来即由国民党军警及飞行堡垒严密戒备，不少挤购者遭受殴打和逮捕。国民党行政院并已于二十三日宣布“暂停兑现”，图以阻止抢购风潮的继续发展。
    国民党政府宣布停止兑现金银以后，伪金圆券贬值更为猛烈，在上海黄金黑市价格二十四日已涨至每两五千元，较之币改“修正”办法规定价格每两一千元已涨高百分之四百。美钞涨至一元合金圆券九十六元，较之币改“修正”办法规定的比价即一比二十，上涨百分之三百七十五。大米每石自二十三日之三百五十元涨至五百元。棉货二十四日一天之内上涨百分之五十，有些物品甚至上涨百分之一百。
