　　Counterfeit Gold Yuan Plunges in Value
　　Serious Business Closures and Unemployment in the Chiang-controlled Areas
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 8th -- According to news from newspapers and magazines in the Kuomintang areas: In October and November, under the impact of the skyrocketing counterfeit Gold Yuan and violent "price controls," many small and medium-sized industrial and commercial enterprises in Nanjing, Changsha, Wuhan, and other places were forced to close down, lay off employees, and reduce production, resulting in massive and tragic unemployment for shop employees and workers. In Nanjing alone, according to unofficial statistics cited by the Tianjin Dagongbao on November 11, more than 20,000 shop assistants were dismissed due to store closures and bankruptcies. In Shanghai, eight out of ten of the 6,000 pancake stalls closed down in mid-October, leaving at least 20,000 pancake stall workers unemployed. (November 1st, "Free Criticism" Shanghai dispatch) Lu Zhengli, the owner of a steamed bun and pancake shop on Xuchang Road, sold out of pancakes and steamed buns during the panic buying in early October, but could not buy flour. Seeing his capital dwindle away, he was forced to commit suicide by cutting his throat with a knife on the 15th of that month. In Changsha, more than ten grain businesses went bankrupt within a month of the currency reform, with over a thousand workers losing their jobs or being laid off, and over a hundred porcelain workers were also dismissed. The relatively large Fuxin Flour Company in Wuhan was ordered by the Kuomintang Food Department in October to purchase 70,000 bags of flour at the "controlled price" of 7.7 yuan per bag of rapidly depreciating counterfeit Gold Yuan. However, the cost of one bag of flour at that time was already 20 yuan. The factory was forced to suspend production because it could not bear the losses. At the end of October, a copper and tin shop on Jiankang Road in Shanghai, unwilling to sell at the "controlled price" to preserve its last bit of capital, reluctantly destroyed its high-quality copper and tin wares.

　　伪金圆券膨胀不已
  　蒋区停业失业严重
    【新华社陕北八日电】据国民党区报纸、杂志消息：十月和十一月间在伪金圆券膨胀和暴力“限价”的打击下，南京、长沙、武汉等地不少中小工商业多被迫停业、裁员和减产，大量店员工人悲惨失业。南京一地，据天津大公报十一月十一日引载之非正式统计，因商店减业倒闭而被遣散的店员即达二万人以上。上海六千个大饼摊中十分之八，于十月中旬停业，至少有两万个大饼摊的伙计失业。（十一月一日“自由批判”上海通讯）许昌路一家馒头大饼店的老板陆正理于十月初抢购风潮中，大饼、馒头卖光，面粉买不进来，眼看本钱将要吃光，被迫于该月十五日以小刀割喉自杀身死。长沙币改后一个多月内花粮业倒闭达十余家，失业与被裁的工人达一千余人，瓷业被解雇技工亦达一百余人。武汉较有规模的一家福新面粉公司，十月间国民党粮食部以迅速贬值的伪金圆券照“限价”每袋七元七角向该公司订购面粉七万袋，而当时一袋面粉成本即需二十元，该厂即因不堪赔累被迫停工。十月底，上海建康路一家铜锡号不愿以“限价”出售为保留最后的一点血本，被迫忍痛将上好的铜器锡器一一打毁。
