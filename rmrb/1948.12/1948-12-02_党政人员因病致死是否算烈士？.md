　　Answer to Zhang Jingchang of Wu Yi County Government:

　　Regarding your question of whether the family of a disabled veteran whose injury recurs or who dies of illness is considered a family of a martyr, and whether the family of a party or government employee who dies of illness is considered a family of a martyr and whether the individual is considered a martyr:

　　According to regulations: those who sacrifice in combat or during war, or who sacrifice in the line of duty, or who are killed by the enemy (such as those captured but unyielding and die bravely, or those assassinated by special agents, etc.) are all called martyrs. Their families are called families of martyrs (referred to as martyr families).

　　If a disabled veteran's injury has not healed upon discharge, and the injury recurs after returning home, resulting in death, their family should be called a martyr's family, and the individual may also be called a martyr; however, if a veteran recovers from their injury and returns home, and the injury recurs due to other reasons, resulting in death, the individual may not be called a martyr, and their family may also not be called a martyr's family. They can enjoy the benefits for a deceased disabled veteran.

　　If a disabled veteran or a party or government employee dies of illness, their family may not be called a martyr's family, and the individual may also not be called a martyr.

　　党政人员因病致死是否算烈士？
    答武邑县府张景昶：
    你所问之荣军彩伤复发或因病而致死后，该家中是否算烈属？党政人员因病致死，家中算不算烈属、他本人算不算烈士？
    按规定：因作战参战牺牲，或因公牺牲，或因被敌杀害（如被俘不屈慷慨就义，被特务暗杀等）者均称烈士。其家属称烈士家属（简称烈属）。
    荣军退伍时伤尚未痊愈，归家后彩伤复发而死亡者，其家中应称烈属，本人亦得称烈士；但伤愈后退伍回家者，因其他原因，致彩伤复发死亡者，本人不得称烈士，其家中同样不得称烈属。可享荣军死亡之优待。
    荣军及党政人员因病致死，家中均不得称烈属，本人同样不得称烈士。
