　　The tenth company of the Yan bandit's 40th division training regiment had a squad leader with two soldiers on guard duty in the field position in front of Umbrella Tree Village. They heard the People's Liberation Army shouting from the opposite side: "Yan army brothers! Don't sell your lives for Yan Xishan, come over and you can go home." They shouted it clearly, sentence by sentence. The three men discussed it for a while, and then jumped over the barbed wire in front of them and surrendered to the People's Liberation Army.

　　The next day, Zhang Dongqing, the head of the training regiment, scolded Zhang Qinghu, the tenth company commander, severely. As soon as Zhang Qinghu went out, he stamped his feet and sighed deeply. Seeing that the tenth company commander was dissatisfied and afraid of trouble, the regimental commander immediately ordered the fourth company to relieve the tenth company from the position.

　　After the battle of Naoma, the 40th Division no longer had companies with twenty people. The fourth company was considered the largest, with fifteen or sixteen people left. On the morning of the 9th, as soon as they took up their position, five of them were shot down by snipers, and the company commander was also slightly wounded. In the evening, they heard the People's Liberation Army shouting warmly: "Yan army brothers! You can't get enough to eat, you can't even get salt, the weather is so cold, and you don't have any charcoal to burn. Now is a good opportunity to escape from the position. No matter whether you are an officer or a soldier, those who come over and want to go home will be given travel expenses." Four more soldiers in the company ran away. The company commander stamped his foot and said, "I won't be a company commander for a company of ten people!" He ran to the position and said to the sentry: "Be careful on guard, the regimental commander is looking for me, I'll be right back." Then he headed south.

　　In the middle of the night, the regimental commander called his guard, Luo Zhongmei, to stand guard. Luo Zhongmei went to the position of the fourth company and saw the platoon leader and the soldiers all bowing their heads, some still crying. The People's Liberation Army was shouting on the opposite side. Luo Zhongmei asked, "Where's your company commander?" Platoon Leader Meng Jinzhao said, "Didn't the regimental commander call him? The company commander went south." Luo Zhongmei said, "Did the regimental commander call your company commander? The regimental headquarters is to the west, and he's going south, isn't that running away!"

　　After a while, Luo Zhongmei quietly called the platoon leader aside and said, "Fellow villager, let's go too!" (They were from the same county and village). Platoon Leader Meng Jinzhao asked, "The Eighth Route Army has been shouting for a long time, saying they are lenient, telling us to go home. I don't know if it's true or false?" Luo Zhongmei said, "I've been a prisoner once, and I know they are really lenient. Taiyuan is burning the last drop of oil in the lamp. The regimental commander is complaining all day long. The front line is constantly retreating, and when we are squeezed into Taiyuan City, we will still have to eat weapons and get hit by artillery shells!"

　　After they discussed it, they called the soldiers to surrender to the People's Liberation Army with them. Fourth Squad Leader Ren Yingyuan, Ninth Squad Leader Wang Changsheng, and two soldiers, afraid that they were being tricked, pretended to refuse, saying, "You go! We won't go." Luo Zhongmei turned his face, raised his gun and said, "Whoever doesn't go will be treated impolitely!" The squad leaders and soldiers saw that they were sincere, and then said, "Are you sincere? What grandson wouldn't want to go!" They all pointed their guns towards the rear and quickly ran to the People's Liberation Army's position.

　　As soon as they entered the position of the Second Company of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army gave them their own dry food to eat and provided them with charcoal fire to warm themselves. After Luo Zhongmei and Meng Jinzhao were full, they automatically climbed onto the position and shouted to the training regiment: "I am Luo Zhongmei, the regimental commander's guard. There is charcoal fire here, and we just had a full meal as soon as we arrived. Come over quickly! A company of ten people is either on duty or digging fortifications, and you have to cook for yourselves, and you can't get enough to eat. Why suffer that torment? We're going home tomorrow!"

　　Before they finished shouting, three more people ran over from the training regiment's position. These were Zhao Dong, Guo Hongan, and Qu Detang, three privates first class from the Seventh Company. Zhao Dong said: "After you came over, the fourth company was left with only a cook and two cooks, who were all assigned to our company. The fourth company has been cancelled. Our seventh company took over your fourth company's position. We three took over your sentry posts, and now we have all run over here."

　　嘴巴仗歼灭了阎匪第四连
    吴林泉
    阎匪四十师补训团十连，一个班长带着两个战士，在伞儿树村前面野战阵地上放警戒。听见对面解放军在喊话：“阎军弟兄们！不要替阎锡山卖命，跑过来可以回家。”一句一句喊的真清楚，三个人商量了一阵，一齐跳过前面的铁丝网向解放军投降了。
    第二天补训团长张东清，把十连长张清虎训骂了一顿。张清虎一出门就跺着脚，长叹了口气。团长见十连长不满，怕出岔子，立刻命令四连把十连从阵地上换下来。
    经过淖马战斗之后，四十师没有上二十个人的连队了，四连算是最大的连，还有十五六个人。九号上午刚上了阵地，就被冷枪打倒了五个，连长也挂了轻彩。晚上又听到解放军亲热的喊话：“阎军弟兄们！你们吃不饱，连盐也吃不上，天气这样冷，你们又没有炭烧，现在阵地正是逃跑的好机会。不管是当官当兵，过来愿回家的给路费”。连里又有四个战士跑了，连长把脚一跺说：“这十几个人的连长也不干了！”就跑到阵地上对排哨说：“你们小心警戒，团长找我，我马上就来。”便一直向南走了。
    半夜团长叫护兵罗中美去放哨，罗中美到四连的阵地上，见排长和战士都低着头，有的还在哭，解放军在对面喊话，罗中美问：“你们连长呢？”排长孟金照说：“不是团长叫去了么？连长向南走了。”罗中美说：“团长那叫你连长呢？团部在西边，他向南走，不是溜了是啥！”
    停了一会，罗中美把排长悄悄叫到一边说：“老乡，咱们也走吧！”（他们是同县同村的人）排长孟金照问：“八路军喊了半天了，说宽大，叫回家，不知是真，还是假？”罗中美说“我当过一次俘虏，我知道是真宽大，太原是熬干了灯油点捻子，团长成天说不满话。火线一直往后退，将来挤到太原城，还不是吃家伙，挨炮弹！”
    他们两个商量好了，便叫当兵的跟他们来投降解放军，四班长任应元，九班长王长胜，和两个战士，怕是诈他们，却假拒绝道：“你们去吧！我们不去”。罗中美翻了脸，把枪一提说：“谁不去就对谁不客气！”班长战士见他们是真心，才说：“你们是真心么？那个龟孙才不愿走！”他们都把枪朝着后面，迅速的跑到解放军的阵地上了。
    刚进解放军某部二连的阵地，解放军的战士把自己的干粮给他们吃，把木炭火给他们烤。罗中美和孟金照吃饱了之后，自动的爬到阵地上向补训团喊：“我是团长的卫士罗中美，这边有木炭火，我们刚过来就吃了一吨饱饭，你们快过来吧！一个连十来个人，不是上岗，就是挖工事，还得自己作饭，又吃不饱，受那熬煎个啥？我们明天就回家了！”
    他们没有喊完，从补训团的阵地上又跑过来三个人。这是七连的赵栋、郭宏安、区德堂三个上等兵。赵栋说：“你们过来后，四连就剩下个勤务兵和两个伙夫，都拨到我们连了，四连已经取消了，我们七连就是接的你们四连阵地，我们三个就是接的你们的哨位，现在我们也都跑过来了。”
