Our Army Marches Victoriously Towards the Ping-Sui Railway Line
	With High Morale and Strong Fighting Spirit
[Frontline of Ping-Sui, 15th Dispatch] The North China People's Liberation Army, marching victoriously towards the Ping-Sui Railway line, is full of fighting spirit and high morale. Along the march from the plains of western Hebei to the mountains of southern Chahar, the masses along the way built colorful archways to welcome the Liberation Army, and the people and the army chanted slogans such as "Attack Ping, Tianjin, and Zhangjiakou, and eliminate Fu Zuoyi" and "Liberate all of North China." The excitement and the encouragement of victory made the soldiers forget their fatigue. Tang Shuao, a soldier from the Sixth Company of a certain unit, carried a machine gun and walked more than 100 li in one stretch. Ma Xuying, a soldier from the "Zhou Dian" unit, voluntarily helped his comrades carry guns, carrying five guns on his back while marching. Cadres competed to carry guns and shoulder oil barrels for the soldiers. Lu Yubao, a famous hero in commanding troops from the "Atlantic" unit, who is now the instructor of a machine gun and artillery company in a certain unit, is again a good example for everyone to learn from in this great march. On the road to the march, there was a jingle written like this: "Lu Yubao, carries a heavy machine gun to climb the mountains!" "If you want to lead troops well, learn from Lu Yubao!" Today's marching athletes will be praised on the road ahead tomorrow. For example, the slogan says that Hu Cai, the machine gun and artillery company commander, takes the lead in bearing hardships during the march, and always carries machine guns and oil barrels on his shoulders along the way. The people of the Zhuolu River were particularly excited to see the Liberation Army marching day and night. They said, "Our army is back, Fu Zuoyi is finished this time!" They talked to the cadres and soldiers of the Liberation Army like they were long-lost family members, recounting the two years of separation and accusing Fu's bandits of their crimes. They vacated the warm kangs for their own army to live in. The commanders and fighters who participated in the defense of Zhangjiakou and the Ping-Zhang section of the battle were even more filled with the joy of victors when they crossed the Yang River and stepped onto the Ping-Sui Railway.

　　向平绥线胜利前进的我军
    战志昂扬士气旺盛
    【平绥前线十五日电】向平绥线胜利进军的华北人民解放军，战志昂扬，士气旺盛。从冀西平原到察南山地的进军道上，沿途群众高搭彩楼，迎送解放军，人民和军队同声欢呼着“打向平、津、张，消灭傅作义”，“解放全华北”的口号。兴奋和胜利的鼓舞，使战士们行军忘记了疲劳，某部六连战士唐树敖，扛着机枪，一气走了一百多里。“周店”部战士马许英，自动帮助战友背枪，一个人背着五条枪行军。干部们争着为战士背枪、挑油担。“大西洋”部著名的带兵英雄吕余保，现任某部机炮连指导员，在这次大进军中，又是大家学习的好榜样。在进军道口写着这样的顺口溜：“吕余保，扛着重机枪爬大山！”“要想带兵好，学习吕余保！”今天行军中的健将，明天便在前进路上得到表扬，如标语上写着机炮连长胡才行军，艰苦在先，不论机枪、油担，一路总在他肩上。涿鹿川下的人民，见到解放军昼夜不停地前进，格外的兴奋，他们说：“咱们的军队回来了，傅作义这下可完蛋了！”他们对解放军的干部战士，象对久别的家人一样叙述两年的别情，控诉着傅匪的罪行，他们把热炕腾出，让自己的军队住。参加过保卫张家口与平张段作战的指战员，当他们越过洋河踏上平绥铁路时，更充满了胜利者的欢欣。
