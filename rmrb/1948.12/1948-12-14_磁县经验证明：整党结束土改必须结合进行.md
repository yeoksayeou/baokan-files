    Ci County Experience Proves: Party Rectification and Land Reform Conclusion Must Be Combined
    [Taihang News] In Ci County, most village branches in villages that began to conclude land reform after the autumn harvest have undergone preliminary rectification. This preliminary party rectification laid a favorable foundation for concluding land reform. According to statistics from six branches and forty-five party members, before rectification, five were actively working, twenty-seven were generally passive, and thirteen were completely inactive. After rectification, forty-three were actively working, and only two remained inactive. This preliminary party rectification proves that concluding land reform is a very good aspect of current party rectification, and also shows that party rectification is a necessary condition for successfully concluding land reform. According to the branches that have undergone rectification, the biggest and most numerous problems of cadres and party members are those that occurred during the leadership of land reform, such as corruption, excessive occupation of fruits, and left-leaning adventurism. Many party members and cadres have therefore become detached from the masses. If this party rectification is not combined with the conclusion of land reform, it will inevitably be empty and divorced from reality; conversely, if the conclusion of land reform is separated from party rectification, it will inevitably hinder the correct conclusion of land reform due to impurity within the party.
    Preliminary party rectification has also proven that current party rectification is an urgent demand of the masses and party members. On the part of the masses, after more than half a year of experience, they deeply feel the harm of chaos, lack of leadership, and a state of anarchy in the village. On the one hand, they hope to resolve the places where they are dissatisfied with the branch, and on the other hand, they also hope that the branch will lead them forward. For example, in Xipengxiang Village, because the branch was inactive, village farmers' associations and other organizations were also scattered and weak. When mobilizing to conclude land reform this time, some cadres of the farmers' association said, "Just tell us what to do. We've been waiting for you to do it!" In Xinlijie, the masses were not enthusiastic about concluding land reform this time before the party rectification, and meetings could not be held. After rectification, most party members became active. The masses also cheered up, and meetings and elections were very active. On the part of party members, they also demand party rectification. On the one hand, they want to understand the bottom line of the policy, and on the other hand, they want to distinguish right from wrong within the branch. In particular, the better party members are more eager to rectify internal unity and work together. Party members in Xipengxiang reflected, "Can we just let the past few years of revolution be?" In many villages, everyone actively engaged in criticism and self-criticism during the rectification. After some party members understood the principles of party rectification, they excitedly said, "We had too few such meetings in the past!"

  Continuing Party Rectification by Discovering Problems in the Process of Concluding Land Reform
    Specific Steps and Experiences of Preliminary Party Rectification
    (1) After arriving in the village, first understand the situation, talk to party members individually, and find activists to rely on during the party rectification; also conduct individual talks with the main cadres and party members, using the method of affirming achievements and reviewing shortcomings to inspire them to consciously conduct self-criticism and mutual criticism. Experience has proven that this step is very important at the beginning of party rectification because the dissatisfaction of party members and the masses is generally concentrated on a few main cadres and party members, and these people generally have more problems and heavier burdens, and are not easy to accept criticism and self-criticism. For example, Zhang Jingu, the secretary of the Xinglijie branch, had a bad work style and resisted party rectification. The district cadre went to the village and talked to him individually. First, he affirmed his previous achievements, and then discussed with him: "How can we rectify this branch?" Gradually inspire him to self-examine. He said: "I have more problems than anyone else. If I can examine myself, it will be easier for everyone to talk." At the branch meeting, he first made a self-criticism, which influenced everyone to examine themselves, and the branch launched a movement of criticism and self-criticism. The Nanchaokou Village did not prepare and talk like this beforehand, so they started a branch meeting. The main party member cadres did not speak, and as a result, everyone looked at each other and did not say a word. Some branches did not examine the main cadre party members, so everyone felt that it was useless to raise it, and some said: "Have we raised it less in the past? Anyway, it's useless." This makes it easy to delay the time.
    (2) After discovering activists, party members have demands for party rectification and ideological preparations, and then hold branch meetings to carry out criticism and self-criticism, distinguish right from wrong, and achieve the goal of unity. For example, the Qijialing branch had serious sectarianism. After this conversation, it was understood that the root of the sectarianism was that both sides suspected that the other was saying bad things about themselves in front of the district cadres. The deeper the suspicion, the more the estrangement. At the branch meeting, after inspiring them to talk about these long-standing problems, they naturally carried out criticism and self-criticism, and unanimously believed that these problems had caused a lot of damage to their work. In this way, the knot was untied. Many branches, after such review, achieved internal unity and initially established a democratic life within the party.
    (3) On the basis of the party members' consciousness, absorb the opinions of the masses. After the preliminary resolution of internal branch problems, the relationship between party and non-party cadres and between party members and the masses is improved. Some are based on the branch as the core, convening a meeting of all cadres, with party members taking the lead in carrying out criticism and self-criticism, eliminating prejudices and estrangement with non-party cadres. After they pass the self criticism along to the masses and absorbing the opinions of the masses and then reviewing it again, the relationship between the party and the masses has been initially improved. Another method is that after the branch has made a clear review, it convenes a meeting of all farmers' associations, party members make self-criticisms, the masses make suggestions, and the branch discusses and answers.
    (Editor's note: The experience of many places proves that it is best for the masses to elect representatives to participate, which can better represent the fair opinions of the masses than allowing the masses to arbitrarily participate in the branch meeting.)
    (4) Continue to carry out party rectification in the conclusion of land reform and other work. After some villages have carried out the above three steps, they believe that the rectification of the branch is complete, and they have not paid attention to implementing it, and as a result, new problems have been discovered. Some villages have clarified that the process of concluding land reform is the process of rectifying the branch. After the initial party rectification, they implement the results of the rectification and solve problems as they are discovered at any time, so that the results of the party rectification can continue to be consolidated. For example, after the initial rectification of the Xinglijie branch, it was discovered that party members had phenomena such as talking about feelings and being irresponsible during the division of class status. They immediately reviewed it at the branch meeting and submitted the review to the People's Congress, which influenced the cadres of the People's Congress to correct their attitudes. Some branches in the Fifth District stipulate that the branch will meet once every ten days and conduct a general review once a month. In this way, the initially established democratic system also consolidates the results of the rectification.
    In general, after such rectification, the thinking of party members has generally been clarified, but there is an important problem that has not been well resolved, that is, this rectification generally lacks future education, and party members do not have a clear goal, so their thinking is still not consolidated. Some people think that after the land reform is over, their task is completed. Some said: "Let's work hard! This is the last time!" Therefore, if future education is not carried out, these achievements and enthusiasm are not easy to persist and consolidate. In addition, some branches did not carry out criticism and self-criticism very well in this rectification, but simply wanted to support the branch; some only solved some internal problems and did not improve the relationship between the party and the masses; and many new problems have occurred in the conclusion of land reform. These branches must continue to pay attention to rectification in the conclusion of land reform to remedy them.

    磁县经验证明：整党结束土改必须结合进行
    【太行讯】磁县在秋后开始结束土改的村庄，绝大部分村支部经过了初步整顿，这个初步整党，给结束土改打下有利的基础，据六个支部四十五个党员的统计，未整顿前积极工作的五人，一般消极的二十七人，躺倒不干的十三人。整顿后积极工作的四十三人，躺倒者只余二人。经过这次初步整党，证明结束土改是当前整党的很好内容，同时也说明整党是做好结束土改的必要条件。据这次经过整顿的支部来看，干部党员最大最多的问题，是在领导土改中发生的问题，如贪污、多占果实、左倾冒险等。许多党员和干部因此而脱离了群众。这次整党如不结合结束土改。必然空洞脱离实际；反之，结束土改如脱离整党，则必然因党内不纯而妨碍正确结束土改。
    经过初步整党，又证明当前整党是群众和党员的迫切要求。在群众方面，经过半年多来的体验，深感村里混乱无领导无政府状态之危害，一方面希望把对支部不满的地方加以解决，另方面还希望支部领导他们前进。如西彭厢村因支部躺倒，村里农会等各种组织也涣散无力，这次动员结束土改，农会有些干部说：“光说你们吧，你们只要干，俺们早等着哩！”新礼街这次结束土改，没整党前，群众情绪不高，开不成会，经过整顿后，党员大部积极起来。群众也提起了劲，开会、选举都很积极。在党员方面，也要求整党，一方面摸摸政策的底，一方面要求在支部内分清是非。特别是较好些的党员，更迫切要求整顿内部团结一致干工作。西彭厢党员反映：“咱革命这几年，能就这样算了？”不少村在整顿中，大家积极批评与自我批评，有的党员明白了整党方针之后，兴奋的说：“过去咱开这样会太少了！”
  在结束土改过程中发现问题继续整党
    初步整党的具体步骤与经验
    （一）到村后首先了解情况，与党员个别谈话，发现积极分子作为整党中的依靠；对主要干部党员，也要进行个别谈话，用肯定成绩检讨缺点的方法，启发其自觉地进行自我批评与相互批评。经验证明：在整党之初，这一步是很重要的，因党员与群众的不满，一般多集中于几个主要干部党员，而这些人一般是问题较多包袱较大，不易接受批评与自我批评。如兴礼街支书张金贵，作风不好，对整党抱抵抗情绪。区干到村便和他个别谈话。首先肯定他以往成绩，然后和他商议：“咱这支部怎样才能整好？”逐渐启发其自我检讨。他说：“就数我毛病大些，我能检讨，大家就都好说了。”在支部开会时，他首先做了检讨，影响大家都检讨起来，支部展开了批评自我批评运动。南岔口村事先没有这样准备和谈话，就开起支部会，主要党员干部不发言，结果大家一个看一个都不哼一声。有些支部因主要干部党员不检讨，大家就感到提也不顶事，有的说：“过去提的少来？反正是不顶事。”这样就易拖延时间。
    （二）发现了积极分子。党员有了整党要求与思想准备之后，进而便举行支部会，开展批评与自我批评，分清是非，达到团结工作的目的。如齐家岭支部闹宗派很厉害，这次经过谈话，了解宗派根源是双方互相怀疑对方在区干面前说自己坏话，怀疑越深隔阂越多。在支部会上启发他们把这些长久积压的问题谈出之后，很自然的开展了批评与自我批评，一致认为这些问题使工作受到不少损失，这样一来，圪塔解开了。不少支部经过这样检讨，达到内部的团结，并初步建立了党内的民主生活。
    （三）在党员自觉的基础上，吸收群众意见。继支部内部问题的初步解决，进而改善党与非党干部之间、党员与群众之间的关系。有的是以支部为核心，召开全体干部会，党员带头开展批评与自我批评，消除与非党干部的成见与隔阂，经过他们，把检讨传播给群众，并吸收群众意见再作检讨，党群关系得到初步改善。另一种是支部检讨清楚后，开全体农会，党员作检讨，群众提意见，支部讨论作答。
    （编者按：不少地方的经验证明，最好是群众选出代表参加，比较由群众任意去参加支部大会，更能代表群众的公正意见些。）
    （四）在结束土改和其他工作中，把整党继续贯串下去。有些村在进行了上述三个步骤之后，便认为整顿支部已完，没注意贯彻下去，结果又发现新问题。有的村明确了结束土改的过程即整顿支部的过程，初步整党之后，把整顿成果贯彻下去，随时发现问题随时解决，使整党成果继续巩固。如兴礼街支部初整之后，在划阶级中，又发现党员有讲情面不负责等现象，马上即在支部会检讨，并把检讨提到人代会，影响人代会干部也摆正了态度。五区有的支部规定支部十天一次会，一月总检讨一次，这样初步建立的民主制度，也巩固了整顿成果。
    总起来看，经过这样整顿，一般澄清了党员的思想，但有个重要问题，没很好解决，即这次整顿中普遍缺乏前途教育，党员没个明确目标，因此思想仍不巩固。有的以为土改结束了，自己任务就完成了。有的说：“好好工作吧！这是最后一次了！”因此，如不进行前途教育，这些成绩与热情很不易坚持巩固下去。另外有些支部在这次整顿中，没很好开展批评与自我批评，只是单纯为了扶起支部；有的只解决了些内部问题，没进行党群关系的改善；在结束土改中又发生不少新问题，这些支部必须在结束土改中继续注意整顿来补救。
