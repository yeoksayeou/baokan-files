【Taiyue Telegram】 The preliminary party rectification work of the Nan'di Village branch in Yangcheng First District, after correctly explaining the Party's rectification policy, strengthening the basic knowledge education of Party members, uniting Party activists and better elements, carrying out criticism and self-criticism, and correctly evaluating merits and demerits, has now achieved preliminary results. The process and methods are introduced as follows for reference by various localities.

　　The Nan'di Village branch was established in 1945 and currently has 24 Party members. Among them, 12 are new middle peasants, 11 are old middle peasants, and 1 is a poor peasant, all of whom emerged as activists in previous mass movements. Since its establishment, the branch has successively completed quite arduous tasks such as land reform, joining the army, and supporting the front. However, on the other hand, there have also been some acts of sheltering landlords and rich peasants, embezzling and occupying the fruits of struggle, and infringing on the interests of the people, which aroused dissatisfaction among the masses. At the same time, due to the unsound organizational life of the branch and the lack of democracy within the Party, criticism was limited to cadres criticizing general Party members, so the above errors could not be corrected in time. Some Party members who gave opinions to the branch secretary were told, "What qualifications do you have to give me opinions?" Correct opinions were not promoted, and righteousness could not suppress evil.

　　At the beginning of this party rectification, after the work team conveyed the party rectification policy, the reactions among Party members varied: those with fewer mistakes felt that there was nothing to rectify; those with more mistakes felt distressed and afraid; and some who had previously had opinions on the main cadres brewed them among the masses and sought help outside the Party. The work team analyzed these situations and decided to first raise Party members' awareness of the Party rectification, so that everyone would see the Party rectification as their own business. The method was to hold small training classes to carry out basic party education and education on the future.

　　After a period of lecturing and discussion, the thoughts and attitudes of Party members gradually changed. Active and better Party members showed activity, saying, "We will never fall behind, we must reflect well, as long as we don't wrong people." This was the majority. Those with major errors also reduced their concerns. However, a mentality of underestimating mistakes also emerged. A Party member with major errors arrogantly said, "I have many problems, and the masses are dissatisfied with me, which proves that I have done a lot of work." He did not mention his theft of fruits, but said, "I should also turn over, and I can no longer be asked to regress to being penniless, right?" He distorted the Party's policy to resist party rectification and reflection.

　　团结党内积极分子开展批评揭发错误
    南底村整党已获初步成绩
    【太岳电】阳城一区南底村支部的初步整顿工作，经过正确讲解党的整党方针，加强党员基本知识教育，团结党内积极分子与较好分子，开展批评与自我批评，正确评功评过，现已取得初步成绩，现将其经过情形与做法介绍如下，供各地参考。
    南底村支部建立于一九四五年，现有党员二十四人。其中新中农十二人，旧中农十一人，贫农一人，都是历次群众运动中涌现出来的积极分子。支部成立以来，曾先后完成过土改，参军、支前等各项相当艰巨的任务。但另一方面，也发生一些包庇地富、贪污霸占斗争果实，侵犯人民利益的行为，使群众不满。同时由于支部的组织生活不健全，党内不民主，批评只限于干部对一般党员，因而上述错误不能及时纠正。有的党员给支书提意见，支书说：“你有什么资格给我提意见？”正确意见得不到发扬，正气压不住邪气。
    此次整党开始，工作组传达了整党方针后，党员中反映各不相同：错误少的，觉得整党也没有什么；错误多的，则思想苦闷、害怕；有些过去对主要干部有意见的，在群众中酝酿，在党外找助力。工作组分析了这些情况，确定首先提高党员对整党的自觉性，使大家把整党看成自己的事。方法是召开小训练班，进行党的基本教育，前途教育。
    经过一段讲授与讨论，党员的思想与态度逐渐起了变化。积极的较好的党员表现活跃，表示“决不落后，一定要好好反省，只要不冤枉人就行。”这是多数。错误大的，也减少了顾虑。但又发生轻视错误的心理。有一个错误很大的党员傲慢地说：“我问题多，群众对我不满意，证明我工作做得多。”他不说自己偷窃果实，反说：“我也该翻身，不能再叫我退成赤贫吧？”他歪曲党的政策来抵抗整党反省。
