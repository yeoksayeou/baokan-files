　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, December 1st. Electrical Communication Agency, Moscow, November 26th: Soviet political economists are being called upon to study how to practically apply socialist economics to the current situation, in order to help the Soviet government and the governments of the people's democratic countries. This was the main content of a four-day meeting recently held by the Scientific Committee of the Institute of Economics of the Soviet Academy of Sciences. The committee is an organization working in coordination with the State Planning Commission. Ostrovitianov, director of the Institute of Economics of the Academy of Sciences, reminded the 4,500 Soviet economists that the Central Committee of the CPSU recently called on philosophers and biologists to do less empty theorizing and strengthen practical results. Economists should also draw the same conclusion from this call. The meeting approved next year's plan, which includes research on the following issues: wage issues in Soviet industry, the role of electrification in the process of completing the transition to communism, and prospects for the development of eastern Siberia.
　　A prominent feature of the theoretical discussions at the meeting was the attack on the views of Varga and some other economists who stubbornly insisted that the capitalist system could have some degree of planned economy and that this planned economy could seemingly turn the class struggle into a compromise between the working class and the bourgeoisie. The meeting also criticized Varga for underestimating the importance of class contradictions in the people's democratic countries and for failing to recognize the leading role of the working class in the people's democratic countries. He failed to emphasize that the democratic countries could only achieve socialism with the help of the Soviet Union.

　　苏联科学院经济研究所开会
  　讨论加强联系实际
    批评瓦尔加与资产阶级妥协的观点
    【新华社陕北一日电】电通社莫斯科十一月二十六日讯：苏联的政治经济学家们，正被号召研究如何把社会主义经济学实际地应用于目前的情况，以帮助苏联政府及人民民主国家的政府。这是苏联科学院经济研究所科学委员会最近召开的四天会议讨论的主要内容。该委员会是与国家计划委员会协同工作的机关。科学院经济研究所所长奥斯特洛维扬诺夫提醒苏联的四千五百个经济学家说：联共中央最近号召哲学家和生物学家少作空泛的理论，加强实际效果。经济学家们也应当从这一号召中得出同样结论。会议通过明年的计划，其中包括对下列问题的研究：苏联工业中的工资问题，电气化在完成向共产主义转变的过程中的作用及对开发东部西伯利亚的展望等。
    会议中理论讨论的显著特点，是抨击瓦尔加及其他一些经济学家的观点，他们顽固地坚持资本主义制度可以有某种程度的计划经济，并说这种计划经济似乎可以使阶级斗争变为工人阶级与资产阶级之间的妥协。会议并批评瓦尔加过低估计人民民主国家中阶级矛盾的重要性和不认识人民民主国家中工人阶级的领导作用。他没有能够强调民主国家只有在苏联的帮助下才能达到社会主义。
