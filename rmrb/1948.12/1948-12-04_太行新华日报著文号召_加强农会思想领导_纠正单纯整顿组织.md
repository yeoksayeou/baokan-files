　　Taihang Xinhua Daily Publishes Article Calling for Strengthening Ideological Leadership of Farmers' Associations and Correcting Purely Organizational Rectification
　　[This newspaper dispatch] The Taihang Xinhua Daily recently published an article calling for the implementation of ideological education and policy education to rectify farmers' associations, and criticizing certain phenomena of purely organizational rectification. In Taihang, at the beginning of the end of land reform, various places carried out the work of rectifying farmers' associations. In the process of rectification, some areas, such as Shenquan Village in Lucheng, adopted the method of summarizing and reviewing the role of farmers' associations in land reform, enabling farmers to further recognize the importance of farmers' associations, examine the shortcomings of farmers' associations in the past, and further consolidate and develop farmers' associations, playing a greater role in ending land reform. However, in some villages, there was a tendency to simply carry out organizational rectification while neglecting ideological leadership. For example, in Luhe Village, Lucheng, the "three don'ts" were proposed in the second rectification of the farmers' association: don't want hooligans and lazy people, don't want those who are afraid of hard work, and don't want those with unstable hands (thieves). As a result, farmers' association members accounted for only 44.8 percent of the total village population. During the third rectification, it was said that it should be expanded, but it only expanded by 2 percent. Other places stipulated overly strict membership conditions, and some villages universally reviewed members. On the other hand, it was also found that there were erroneous practices of absorbing rich peasants who had not changed their class status into the farmers' association.
　　Based on these situations, the article first pointed out that only through rectifying the farmers' association and implementing ideological education and policy education can farmers' awareness be improved, policies be correctly implemented, the work of ending land reform be done well, and the goal of uniting for production be achieved. It then pointed out that neglecting ideological rectification obscures the importance and purpose of rectification, forming a "rectification for the sake of rectification." Of course, organizational rectification is also important, but if the door is closed to the vast number of farmers, it violates the purpose of truly uniting the vast number of farmers to end land reform and move towards united production. In general, all those who belong to the farmer class after clarifying class boundaries and correcting class status should be absorbed into the farmers' association. Even if some people still have certain shortcomings, they should be absorbed into the farmers' association and gradually transformed through education. Of course, on the other hand, right-leaning tendencies should be prevented, and landlords and rich peasants who have not changed their class status should not be allowed to mix into the farmers' association. Today, the general bias is purely organizational rectification, which is not combined with ideological rectification, which is wrong. The main content of ideological rectification should be the implementation of policy education, the improvement of farmers' awareness, so as to clear away ideological obstacles in ending land reform, so that policies can be supported by all farmers.

### 太行新华日报著文号召　加强农会思想领导  纠正单纯整顿组织

　　太行新华日报著文号召
  　加强农会思想领导  纠正单纯整顿组织
    【本报讯】太行新华日报顷发表论文，号召贯彻思想教育与政策教育整顿农会，并批判某些单纯组织整顿的现象。太行在结束土改的开始，各地均曾进行整顿农会的工作。在整顿过程中，有些地区如潞城的神泉等村，采取了总结与回顾农会在土改中的作用，使农民进一步认识了农会的重要性，检讨了过去农会的缺点，使农会进一步巩固与发展，在结束土改中起更大作用。但也有部分村庄，发生单纯进行组织整顿忽视思想领导的偏向。如潞城潞河村，在第二次整顿农会中提出“三不要”：流氓懒汉不要，好吃怕劳动的不要，手不稳（小偷）的不要。这样一来农会会员只占全村总人口的百分之四十四点八。第三次整顿时，说要扩大，但也只扩大了百分之二。其他地方则规定过严的入会条件，有的村并普遍审查会员。而另一方面也发现有把未变成份的富农也吸收进农会的错误作法。
    该文根据这些情况首先指出：只有经过整顿农会，贯彻思想教育与政策教育，才能使农民觉悟提高，正确贯彻政策，把结束土改工作做好，达到团结生产的目的。继指出：忽视思想整顿，是模糊了整顿的重要性与目的，形成了“为整顿而整顿”。当然组织整顿也是重要的，但如果对广大农民关门，就是违背了真正团结广大农民结束土改走向团结生产的目的。凡经过划清阶级订正成份后属于农民阶级的，一般应吸收参加农会，即使有部分人尚有某些缺点，也应吸收到农会中经过教育逐渐改造。当然，另一方面应该防止右倾，不能让未改变成份的地主富农混入农会。今天一般的偏向是单纯的组织整顿，不与思想整顿结合，这是不对的。思想整顿的主要内容，应是贯彻政策教育，提高农民觉悟，以扫清结束土改中的思想障碍，使政策得到全体农民的支持。
