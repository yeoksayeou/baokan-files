    Land Registration Must Be Realistic
    The Land Certificate Should Reflect the Actual Acreage

    To the Editors:
    Our county is about to issue land certificates, but there is a problem. For example, one family's burden ledger shows a plot of land recorded as five mu, but after measurement during equal distribution, the actual size is four mu and two fen. How should this be filled in on the land certificate? If we follow the original number, they will be burdened with empty land. If we use the actual number, many households will fall short of the recorded acreage, and we are afraid it will provoke a widespread demand from the masses to measure the land. Many people have asked us about this. We hope you can answer this for us!

    Answer: Your county is about to issue land certificates, but some land was registered higher in the past, and after measurement during equal distribution, it does not meet the original registered acreage. This should be based on the spirit of seeking truth from facts: register however much there is. Your fear of provoking a widespread demand from the masses to measure the land is incorrect. The government's land registration is not about deceiving the masses by registering more; it is about being as accurate as possible. If the masses widely demand to measure the land, it shows that our past work was not sufficient and did not achieve accuracy. It is a good phenomenon that the masses are rising up to demand accurate registration. The problem lies in whether the ruler used for measuring the land during equal distribution was too large. If the ruler was large, the land measurement would naturally be inaccurate. The standard ruler stipulated by the government is the construction ruler (营造尺) (i.e., the carpenter's ruler 木斤尺 used by carpenters). If the construction ruler was used for measuring the land during equal distribution, then it means that the past registration was too high. If a larger ruler was used, then the acreage from the equal distribution cannot be used as a standard. One should consider which acreage was accurate and register based on that. If necessary, measure using the standard ruler. The overall goal is to achieve accurate acreage registration.

### 登记土地须实事求是  土地证上应写实有亩数

    登记土地须实事求是
    土地证上应写实有亩数编辑同志：
    现我县将要颁发土地证，但其中有个问题，如一家，原来造负担册子有一块地是在册子上造的五亩，经平分时丈量，实际是四亩二分，这在发土地证时怎样填写？如照原地数，即负担着空地，如按实数，则不够亩数的户很多，恐怕惹起群众普遍要求丈量土地，问我们的群众很多，希你们答复为盼！
              孟庆杰、张进海    十月六号
    答：你县将要颁发土地证，但有些土地在过去登记高了些，在平分时丈量后不敷原来的登记亩数了，这应该本着实事求是的精神有多少就登记多少，你恐怕惹起群众普遍的要求丈量这是不对的，政府登记土地并不是欺骗群众越多登记一些越好，而是要求越真实越好，群众普遍要求丈量土地，这说明咱们过去工作做的不够，没有达到真实，群众起来要求登记真实这是好的现象，问题是在于平分时丈量土地用的尺子是否大了一些，如果尺子大了，丈量土地自然要脱数，政府规定的标准尺子是营造尺（即木斤尺就是木匠用的尺子），如果平分时丈量土地是用的营造尺那就说明过去登记得高了，要是用的尺子大了也就不能用平分时的亩数作标准，应该酌量那一次的亩数真实就按那一次登记，必要时就按标准尺丈量，总的目的是要求达到真实的亩数登记才好。
