　　Hejian Dongshawa Cooperative
    Provides Credit Loans to Support Mass Production
    [Hejian News] The cooperative in Dongshawa Village, Hejian, actively handles credit business to help the masses with production.
    There used to be a cooperative in this village, but it was closed down when the cooperative's cadres were dismissed during the review in July last year. When the land reform ended in August this year, the Party's policies were implemented through various meetings. With the help of the district committee, the cooperative was reorganized. At the beginning, there were 35 shareholders. Later, the farmers' association added some undistributed willow trees as shares, priced and distributed to households entitled to floating assets. Those who did not want to become shareholders could withdraw. In this way, the number of members increased to 44, with a total share capital of more than 130,000 yuan (new currency, same below). On the tenth day of the ninth lunar month, a general meeting of shareholders was held, and a director and staff were elected. Articles of association were also drawn up at the meeting.
    After its establishment, the cooperative began credit business activities. By the end of the ninth lunar month, a total of more than 100,000 yuan had been loaned to 21 households with production difficulties. These included three households engaged in oil pressing, four households in weaving, one flour mill, twelve households engaged in transport and sales, and one household repaying debt. They also stipulated a daily interest rate of four per mille for loans, with a term of half a month. If the loan could not be repaid by the due date, a separate contract could be drawn up. After the credit business was launched, the masses felt it was much more convenient. Ge Qingming and two other families engaged in oil pressing had no capital, so they borrowed 30,000 yuan and started their business.
    On the first day of the tenth lunar month, another general meeting of shareholders was held to specifically discuss the cooperative's business. In addition to handling credit business, it was also decided: 1. According to the needs of the masses, the woodworking factory will start work immediately to make spinning wheels, looms, and some farm tools from willow trees; 2. Expand the credit business and call on the masses to deposit grain and money. After this meeting, the woodworking factory has already started work, and many members have placed orders, and some members have also started depositing and lending grain. The masses all said, "It's so much more convenient to have such a cooperative!"

　　河间东沙洼合作社
    办理信用贷款扶助群众生产
    【河间消息】河间东沙洼村的合作社，积极办理信用业务，帮助群众生产。
    这村早先有个合作社，去年七月里复查的时候，合作社的干部被撤了职，就结束了。今年八月里结束土改的时候，通过各种会议，贯彻了党的政策，在区委的帮助下，合作社又组织起来。开始共有三十五家入股的，后来农会又把一部分没有分的柳树入上股，合成价分到应分浮财户的名下，不愿入股的还可以抽出。这样社员一共增到四十四家，股金十三万余元（新币，下同）。九月初十召开社员大会，选出了主任和职员。还在会上订出了章程。
    成立起来以后，就开始了信用业务活动，到旧历九月底，共贷出款十万余元，贷给了二十一户生产上有困难的户。计有打油的三户，织布的四户，粉坊一户，作运销的十二户，还帐的一户。他们还规定了贷款日息四厘，期限半个月，到期不能还可另立契约。办理信用业务以后，群众都感觉方便多了。葛清明等三家打油没本钱，贷了三万元也开张了。
    阴历十月初一，又召开社员大会，具体的讨论了合作社的业务。除了办理信用业务以外，还决定：一、根据群众需要，木厂马上开工，把柳树作成纺车、织布机，和一些农具；二、扩大信用业务，号召群众存粮存款。这次会以后，木厂已经开工，有好多社员订了货，有的社员也开始了存粮和贷粮。群众都说：“有这样的合作社可方便多了！”
