　　Large-Scale Desertions of Chiang's Troops from Beiping-Tianjin Area
　　Just Four Months See 7,000 Deserters Passing Through Southern Hebei
    [Jinan Telegram] The People's Liberation Army's continuous victories on all battlefields have prompted a steady stream of Chiang Kai-shek's troops from isolated strongholds like Beiping and Tianjin to desert to the liberated areas. The number heading south along the Hengshui-Guantao highway is incessant daily. According to registrations at the Southern Hebei Administrative Office's reception center, a total of 7,101 people passed through from June to the end of October. All those who passed through our reception center were treated warmly and generously with accommodation, meals, and travel expenses provided. Those who were mildly ill were referred to health clinics for treatment, while those with serious illnesses were sent to hospitals. One person named Xiao Haisheng, who suffered from typhoid fever, made a full recovery in eleven days and expressed endless gratitude. The majority of the Chiang's troops who deserted were from provinces such as Jiangsu, Anhui, Hubei, and Hunan, mostly impoverished farmers who were forcibly conscripted by the Kuomintang last spring. Pan Xibao and two others, who escaped from inside Beiping city from Chiang's 94th Army, said: "In Beiping, we saw shocking slogans written on the walls during the day saying 'Down with Fu Zuoyi' and 'If you want to live, quickly flee to the liberated areas'," thus creating a wave of desertions within the Chiang's troops in Beiping. Pan said: "No matter how severe the repression, we must risk everything to escape." Another group had been transported by steamship from Shanghai to the Northeast last year and incorporated into Chiang's 52nd, 71st, and 93rd Armies. Tang Guohua (from Guizhou), a squad leader from the 7th Company of the 112th Regiment of the 38th Division, said: "After I was captured by the Kuomintang, all my freedom was taken away. Eating and sleeping were under surveillance, and even going to the toilet required reporting. It's hard to describe the hardship of life. Prices were high, and we weren't even paid, so we never had enough to eat. The officers often slandered the People's Liberation Army and engaged in deception. Later, when I saw the PLA's slogans, I learned that the Communist Party was lenient. Therefore, we formed a group, and on July 7th this year, we deserted from Shenyang with our weapons. The people's governments everywhere provided travel expenses and issued passes, which made me feel deeply grateful. I now request to join the People's Liberation Army, fight back to my hometown, and never suffer the Kuomintang's oppression again." Influenced and connected by him, 116 people joined the People's Liberation Army from September 6th to the end of October. They are now wearing new cotton-padded clothes, preparing to follow the People's Liberation Army to fight back to their hometowns.
    [Jilu-Yu Telegram, 27th] In the past three and a half months, the 3rd Officer Training Regiment of the North China Military Region has released over a thousand Kuomintang officers and soldiers. Since the beginning of the third year of the Liberation War, the regiment has received a total of 1,973 Kuomintang officers and soldiers who had been liberated, including 1,049 field grade officers and staff officers, most of whom were liberated in the Kaifeng and Suidong campaigns. After a short period of study, their illusions about Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous regime have gradually been dispelled, and they have gained an understanding of the victorious development of the People's Liberation War. Apart from 281 who directly participated in the work of the People's Liberation Army, 1,011 have been released in batches. When released, the regiment held variety shows and dinners, provided full travel expenses, and sent cadres to escort them out of the border. Before leaving, the released personnel all established specific plans, vowing to serve the people after returning to the Kuomintang-controlled areas. Among the Kuomintang soldiers received by the regiment during this period, 107 were automatic defectors, more than 30% of whom carried firearms. After only ten days of study, all of them joined the People's Liberation Army.

　　平津等地蒋军大批逃亡
  　仅仅在四个月内七千人逃经冀南
    【冀南电】人民解放军在各个战场的连续大捷，促成平、津等孤立据点蒋匪军不断逃来解放区。从衡水至馆陶公路南下者，每日络绎不绝，据冀南行署招待所登记，从六月至十月底共路过七千一百零一名，凡经我招待所者无不热情宽待，住宿吃饭，发给路费，有病的轻者介绍卫生所治疗，重者送医院治疗，有一叫萧海生的身患瘟症，十一天全愈出院，表示无限感激。逃来之蒋军，大部是江苏、安徽、湖北、湖南等省人氏，多数是贫苦农民，均为去年春天被国民党抓捕，强征。从北平城内逃来之蒋九十四军潘锡保等三人说：在北平白天就见墙上写出“打倒傅作义”，“要逃活命快往解放区”的惊人标语，因此造成北平蒋军的逃亡浪潮。潘说：“无论如何严刑镇压，我们也得拼命跑。”另一部是去年由上海坐火轮运至东北，编入蒋匪五十二、七十一、九十三军。三十八师一一二团七连班长唐国华（贵州人）说：“我被国民党抓去后，一切自由都被剥夺，吃饭睡觉都有人警戒，大小便也须报告，提起生活来一言难尽，物价贵，饷也不发给，顿顿吃不饱。当官的时常诬蔑解放军，进行欺骗，后来见了解放军的标语，才知道共产党宽大对待，因此俺们结了一伙，今年七月七从沈阳带枪跑出来，路过各地人民政府，处处给路费，开通行证，使我于心不忍，我现在要求参加人民解放军，打回老家去，再不受国民党的气了”。在他影响和串连下，自九月六日至十月底，就有一百一十六名加入解放军，现在都穿上新的棉衣，准备跟着人民解放军打回老家去。
    【冀鲁豫廿七日电】华北军区解放军官教导第三团，三个半月来释放国民党军官兵千余名。该团自解放战争第三年开始迄今，共接收被解放了的国民党军官兵一九七三名，其中校尉级军官占一零四九名，且多为开封、睢东战役中所解放者，经短期学习后，彼等对蒋介石卖国政权的幻想已逐渐消除，而对人民解放战争胜利发展有了认识。除二八一名直接参加解放军工作外，先后分批释放者达一零一一名，释放时，该团曾举行游艺晚会及会餐，并发足路费，派干部护送出境，被释放人员临别时均各自订立具体计划，立誓回到蒋管区后要为人民服务，该团这一时期接收了国民党军士兵中有一零七名为自动逃来者，其百分之卅以上并携有枪械，仅经十天学习即全部参加解放军。
