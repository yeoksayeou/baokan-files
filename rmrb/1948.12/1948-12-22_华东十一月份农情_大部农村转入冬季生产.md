Xinhua News Agency, East China, 17th—In November, except for the flood-stricken areas in central and southern Shandong in the East China region, which continued to open canals for drainage and rush to cultivate and plant, most rural areas have shifted to winter production. The details are as follows:

(1) Winter plowing. In the past, most areas of Shandong had no habit of winter plowing. In recent years, key experiments have started in the old liberated areas, and this year some areas have gradually promoted it from point to area. According to statistics from only four counties in Jiaodong area, namely Pingxi, Changyi, Yena, and Weibei, as of November 20, more than 273,000 mu have been winter plowed, of which Pingxi alone winter plowed 121,000 mu, accounting for one-third of the spring fields next year. In areas with insect pests or floods, calling on people to plow land with many insects first, or sticky land, is most easily accepted by farmers. In Luwang District, Yena County, 2,100 mu of land with many insects was winter plowed, and more than 4,900 jin of bean insects were caught for composting. The farmers of Penglai broke with old habits and invested in winter plowing. In the middle ten days of November, according to statistics from twelve districts, more than 60,000 mu of land has been cultivated. Some district villages have now been completely cultivated. Xiaofeng District of the county mobilized a large number of women to participate in winter plowing. Among the 62 young women in Chaoshui and Yangtou villages, 55 have learned to cultivate land. In a few areas with the habit of winter plowing, such as Hefang District in Yangxin County, Bohai Bay, the results of winter plowing are even more remarkable. The district cultivated more than 28,000 mu of land in 20 days, accounting for more than 82 percent of all land that should be winter plowed.

In guiding farmers to winter plow, leadership at all levels first publicized the policy of getting rich through labor, eliminating farmers' concerns about being taxed after cultivating good land. At the same time, practical examples were used to illustrate the benefits of winter plowing, breaking the conservative thinking of cadres and farmers. When village cadres in Guanzhuang District, Mengyin County, were discussing how to lead winter plowing, they were worried that farmers would not be mobilized, but after hearing that Zhang Zhengjie, the village chief of Jiajiazhuang, said that his two mu of rice harvested three bags last year due to winter plowing, while the one mu that was not winter plowed did not even harvest one bag, they felt that they had a solution. The next specific issue to be resolved was the use of animal power and labor organization. Lubei District of Huang County adopted a mutually beneficial method of exchanging cattle grass for livestock and female labor for male labor. The Yiyuan Diaoyutai branch found that cattle owners were unwilling to rent out their cattle because their wages were often in arrears and the price of labor was not fixed. Farmers were busy doing odd jobs, so that both labor and animal power became problems, affecting the implementation of the winter plowing plan. Therefore, they focused on clearing the wages of cattle for autumn plowing, agreed on the price of cattle labor for winter plowing, and proposed that children cut grass, women move farm implements, and old men build heated brick beds, resulting in twelve labor exchange groups of full labor and two plowing cattle being sent to the fields. However, there are also some areas with conditions for carrying out winter plowing that are still at the stage of general appeals, satisfied with challenges and competitions, lacking in-depth inspection, and failing to specifically solve problems such as animal power and labor, causing the plan to fail.

(2) Manure accumulation. All localities attach great importance to manure accumulation. The Bohai region proposed "one cart of manure accumulated in winter this year, one more dou of grain next year," and the CCP Beihai Prefectural Committee proposed launching a "three piles" (manure pile, mud pile, grass pile) campaign, which was responded to by farmers. Farmers in Yanglan Village, Huang County, picked more than 300,000 jin of grass, moved more than 15,000 loads of mud, and accumulated more than 400,000 jin of grass mud. Every household's door was filled with mud piles and haystacks. The more common method in various places is to pick up grass and manure for fertilizer accumulation, which has formed a mass movement in some villages relying on market towns. Tianchengdian Farmers' Association in Changbei County picked up more than 400 jin of manure, influencing more than 30 people to pick up manure early, and the leader of the children's corps also picked up a basket early in the morning. Five villages in Shidao City, Rongcheng County, built 165 urine pools to collect urine for fertilizer accumulation.

In areas where the vermicelli and oil industries have a foundation and sales channels and have reported good harvests this year, some villages have begun to resume grinding vermicelli and pressing oil, raising pigs for fertilizer accumulation. In Guodu District, Xintai County, 36 villages formed 176 vermicelli workshops as shareholders. Gaoyazhuang alone has 20 vermicelli workshops that have already fed 20 pigs, and can accumulate at least 600 carts of manure in one winter. In Zhanglu Village, which has 74 households, 53 households organized nine vermicelli groups and bought 25 pigs in five days. In the mainland Guanzhuang five labor exchange groups in Yibei County, central and southern Shandong, they raised 11,400 jin of mung beans and formed six vermicelli workshops, producing 180 jin of vermicelli a day, earning 420 jin of residue, and can compost 360 carts of manure per month. The whole village has already raised 110 pigs, and plans to add to 200.

(3) Sideline occupations. Winter sideline occupations in various places are mainly making military shoes and transportation in conjunction with supporting the front lines. After women in the vast rural areas south of Jiaoji Road realized that making military shoes has the dual significance of supporting the front lines and preparing for famine, the quality and quantity of military shoes they made have improved significantly compared with the spring. In Binbei County, central and southern Shandong, it is planned to complete one million pairs of military shoes by the end of December, and it is estimated that farmers can increase their income by 300,000 to 400,000 yuan. According to statistics from Yinan, Yishan, Binhai, Binbei and other counties in the Lunan area, 240,000 pairs of military shoes have been completed and sent to the front in mid-November.

The scale of the transportation industry is also gradually expanding with the development of the military situation. The Bohai region has established transportation lines from Huimin to Jinan, and set up transportation stations and cart inns along the way to help farmers solve transportation difficulties. The Bohai Promotion Agency has organized the transportation of 5 million jin of grain to Jinan, and transported back a large number of Yellow River control equipment, agricultural tools and daily necessities from that area. The Binhai District and the Binbei Sub-district of the Jiaodong District are now deploying the transportation of over ten thousand jin of grain to support the Huaihai Campaign. The government is actively organizing farmers to contract for grain transportation, bringing back return goods, so that the masses can benefit from the round trip and develop large-scale transportation industry.

(4) Production and Famine Preparation. Last year, the East China region suffered severe disasters, and the harvest this year was better. The autumn harvest in most areas of Shandong averaged 60% to 70%, causing some cadres and farmers to have a sense of complacency. Farmers in Nanma Town, Linqu County, believed that "after suffering for half a year from eating bran and vegetables, we must make up for it after harvesting new grain." Villagers in Xixiao Village, Cangshan County, even had a big meal and drink when transporting grain, wasting more than 2 million yuan. Some district cadres in Yedian District, Mengyin County, also had blind optimism. However, after receiving instructions from higher authorities on famine preparation and conducting specific investigations in several villages, they found that the grain of some farmers was only enough to eat until the beginning of next year. The complacent mood of these district cadres began to change, and they actively led farmers to plan for famine preparation. The farmers in the district dried a total of 10,600 jin of dried vegetables, established 50 small oil mills, and 6 vermicelli mills. In addition, more than 100 households have organized to engage in transportation. In Furong District, Cangshan County, 21,000 mu of bean land in 46 villages was flooded. The CCP sub-district committee led the farmers to cut grass and make rain capes for production and famine preparation, while saving money and food. Some villages plan to save four liang of grain per person per day, and by the end of the twelfth lunar month, each person can save 25 jin, which can survive the spring famine. Jiaodong also pays more attention to famine preparation. The whole district has collected more than 7 million jin of dried vegetables, and is now seizing the favorable opportunity before the heavy snow seals the door to develop sideline production and prepare for famine.

　　华东十一月份农情
    大部农村转入冬季生产
    【新华社华东十七日电】十一月份，华东区除华中、鲁中南部分水灾区继续开渠排水和抢耕抢种外，大部农村已转入冬季生产。兹逐项分述如下：
    （一）冬耕。山东大部地区过去本无冬耕习惯，近年才由老解放区开始作重点试验，今年已有部分地区从点到面逐渐推广。胶东区仅据平西、昌邑、掖南、潍北等四县统计，至十一月二十日止，已冬耕二十七万三千余亩，其中平西一县即冬耕十二万一千亩，占明年春田的三分之一。在虫灾或水灾地区号召先耕虫多地，或粘土地，最易为农民接受。掖南县路旺区冬耕虫多地二千一百亩，捉了四千九百多斤豆虫沤肥。蓬莱农民打破旧习，投入冬耕。十一月中旬十天时间，据十二个区统计，已耕地六万余亩，部分区村现已全部耕完。该县晓峰区发动了大批妇女参加冬耕。潮水、阳头两村六十二名青年妇女，已有五十五名学会了耕地。在素有冬耕习惯的少数地区，如渤海湾阳信县何坊区，冬耕成绩更为显著。该区二十天即耕地二万八千余亩，占全部应冬耕土地百分之八十二强。
    在领导农民冬耕中，各级领导机关首先宣传了劳动发家政策，消除农民怕耕好地后被抽去的顾虑。同时并以实际例子说明冬耕的好处，打破干部和农民的守旧思想。蒙阴县官庄区村干部在座谈领导冬耕工作时都发愁，恐怕农民动员不起来，但听到贾家庄村长张正杰说起自己去年冬耕的二亩谷收了三口袋，没冬耕的一亩还收不到一口袋这个实例以后，就觉得有了办法。紧接着要具体解决的是畜力使用和劳动组织等问题。黄县芦北区采用了以牛草换牲口，以女工换男工的互助两利办法。沂源钓鱼台支部，发现牛主因耕牛工资常被拖欠，工价又未定，因此不愿出租，农民忙着干零活，以致劳力畜力均成问题，影响冬耕计划的贯彻，便抓紧领导清还秋耕牛工资，议定冬耕牛工价，提出儿童割草，妇女搬犋，老汉置炕，结果替出十二个变工组整劳动力和两犋牛全部下坡。但是，也有某些有条件开展冬耕的地区，直到现在还停止在一般号召的阶段，满足于挑战、竞赛，而缺乏深入检查，未具体解决畜力、劳力等问题，使计划落空。
    （二）积肥。各地都很重视积肥。渤海区提出“今年冬积肥一车，明年多打粮一斗”，中共北海地委提出开展“一大堆”（粪堆、泥堆、草堆）运动，都得到了农民的响应。黄县羊岚村农民拾草三十余万斤，搬泥一万五千余驮，积草泥四十余万斤，家家门口堆满了泥堆、草垛。各地较普遍的办法是拾草、拾粪积肥，这在部分靠集市的乡村已形成群众性运动。昌北县天成店农会长拾粪四百多斤，影响三十多人都起早拾粪，儿童团长也一早拾一筐。荣城县石岛市五个村修起一百六十五个尿池子接尿积肥。
    在粉丝业、油业有基础有销路而今年又告丰收的地区，部分村庄开始恢复推粉打油，养猪积肥。新泰县果都区三十六个村，农民合股组成一百七十六座粉坊，仅高崖庄二十座粉坊即已喂猪二十口，一冬最少能积粪六百车。七十四户的张芦村，有五十三户组织了九个推粉小组，五天买进二十五个猪。鲁中南区沂北县大陆官庄五个变工组，凑绿豆一万一千四百斤，组成六座粉坊，一天出一百八十斤粉，赚四百二十斤渣，每月能沤三百六十车粪。全村已喂一百一十口猪，还准备添到二百口。
    （三）副业。各地冬季副业，以与支援前线结合的做军鞋和运输为较多。胶济路南广大农村妇女认识了做军鞋具有支援前线与备荒的两重意义后，所做军鞋质量数量均较春季有显著提高。鲁中南区滨北县十二月底，计划完成一百万双军鞋，估计农民可因此增加收入三十万万到四十万万元。现据沂南、沂山、滨海、滨北等县推进社统计，十一月中旬已完成二十四万双军鞋送往前方。
    运输业的规模亦随军事形势的发展而逐渐扩大。渤海区建立了从惠民到济南等地的运输线，沿线设运销站、大车店，帮助农民解决运输困难。渤海推进社已组织向济南运粮五百万斤，从该地运回大批治黄器材，及农具日用品。现滨海区及胶东区的滨北分区部署运粮×万万余斤支援淮海战役。政府正积极组织农民包工运粮，带回头货，使群众往返有利可图，以开展大规模的运输业。
    （四）生产备荒。华东大部地区去年灾荒严重，今年收成较好，山东大部地区秋收平均达六、七成，部分干部和农民因此产生自满思想。临朐县南麻镇农民认为“吃糠和菜受了半年罪，打下新粮可要找补找补。”苍山县西硝村民工在运粮时竟发生大吃大喝现象，浪费了二百多万元。蒙阴县野店区有的区干部也有盲目乐观现象。但在接到上级关于备荒的指示，具体调查了几个村，发现若干农户的粮食仅够吃到明年年初后，这些区干部的自满情绪开始转变，积极领导农民计划备荒。该区农民共晒了干菜一万零六百斤，成立了五十座小油坊，六处粉坊，此外有百余户已组织起来搞运输。苍山县芙蓉区四十六村，被淹二万一千余亩豆地。该区中共分区委领导农民一面割草结蓑衣生产备荒，一面省吃俭用。有的村计划每人每天节约粮食四两，到腊月底每人可节省二十五斤，即能渡过春荒。胶东各地对备荒工作也较为重视，全区已集干菜七百余万斤，现正抓紧大雪封门以前的有利时机，发展副业生产备荒。
