　　【Jinzhong Electric】The Taihang She County and Licheng expeditionary civil laborers participating in the Taiyuan Campaign have strengthened their study of military common sense to avoid unnecessary casualties. They also conducted a review of anti-desertion measures, which resulted in saving manpower, improving efficiency, and maintaining consistently high morale among the team members. Initially, the civil laborer cadres in She County had a serious sense of complacency and paralysis, believing that the team members were well-trained and had participated in major battles such as Pinghan, Northern Henan, and Shangdang. They thought no major problems would arise this time. Therefore, the leadership did not adequately understand and study the special circumstances of this frontline support effort (such as complex composition of members, cold weather, and extremely poor preparation beforehand) to educate the civil laborers. Shortly after accepting the mission, one member of the first brigade was killed, and two were injured. Coupled with the harsh living conditions, some civil laborers experienced ideological fluctuations, with a few wavering and deserting. However, this did not attract the attention of some cadres, who still believed that no major problems would arise and even failed to study the instructions of the support headquarters. It was not until several people from the third brigade were injured by enemy artillery fire while transporting ammunition to the front line that widespread attention was drawn from cadres at all levels. The main problems were the fear and panic of the team members and the handling of deserters. To solve these problems, cadres from the support headquarters, together with brigade cadres, first studied the causes of these problems, mainly due to a lack of military common sense and technical knowledge. After identifying these reasons, each company conducted a universal review and retrospect in light of actual conditions. At the same time, they also invited team members with more military common sense to explain methods for air defense and avoiding artillery fire, which resulted in everyone realizing that artillery shells were not as terrifying as they seemed. One team member from the third brigade said, "If we had dispersed that day and quickly laid down when we heard the artillery fire, we definitely wouldn't have been injured." Another team member said, "What they said is right. You can hear the sound of the artillery shells coming first. If you pay attention beforehand, and hide under a rock as soon as you hear it, you'll be fine." After such discussions and explanations, everyone unanimously agreed that artillery shells could be dodged and losses could be reduced. On this basis, they discussed future measures: (1) Cadres at all levels should be truly responsible and conscientiously accept tasks. At the same time, cadres should first select roads and terrain, determine transportation methods, and the order of march. (2) Before passing through the blockade line, the team members should be stopped briefly, both to draw their mental attention and to inform them of precautions. (3) Upon reaching our artillery positions, the team members should immediately put down the ammunition boxes and leave, with a few cadres handing over the mission. (4) After each mission is completed, the command action should be reviewed. After implementing these measures, the effect was very good. For example, a certain company of the first brigade had to pass through two blockade lines to deliver artillery shells to the position, but they passed safely back and forth several times. Many team members said: If we had this method earlier, nothing would have happened. Team members of the third company of the first brigade said excitedly: "If we keep doing this, we'll learn everything in two months." This not only eliminated everyone's panic, but also greatly increased transportation efficiency. One night, the second and third companies were called to deliver ammunition. The second company went early and completed the number of tasks assigned to the third company.

　　In dealing with the problem of desertion, they first studied the ideological changes of those who deserted and returned to the team, and found that these civil laborers basically did not want to desert. The individual reasons for desertion were mainly due to fear and panic, being instigated by others, or due to shortcomings in leadership. In addition, some civil laborers had undergone fierce ideological struggles before deserting, especially regarding the issues of honor and shame, and the individual versus the collective. Even after escaping, they had many concerns on the road. Based on this basic ideological situation, a universal heart-to-heart movement was launched within the team, calling on everyone to talk about their concerns and speak the truth. Cadres first reviewed themselves, which inspired everyone to speak enthusiastically. Zhang Xiaogen from the first company of the fifth brigade said, "I deserted when I lived in Yangqu, which is really shameful. As soon as I got to the village, I ran into an acquaintance. At that time, I didn't even dare to raise my head, and I hid in another house. The next day, the village held a meeting of military families and families of those participating in the war to solve the autumn harvest issue, and my family also participated. I was very touched at the time. The next day, the village sent me back. Now I regret it very much, and I will never desert again in the future. And from tomorrow onwards, I will definitely make up for my mistakes with meritorious service." Li Luowu from the third company said, "I've thought it through. Everyone is sending artillery shells to fight the enemy, but I'm feigning illness to eat, which makes me feel guilty. I must work hard in the future and definitely won't feign illness again."

　　In order to consolidate the civil laborers and improve their ideological understanding, Licheng specifically put forward slogans such as "Think of disaster years when enduring hardship," "Think of fleeing and betraying when participating in the war," "Strive for glory," and "Become a model by earning merits." The meeting reporting system was also improved. The two units have completely eliminated desertion twenty days ago. The morale of the civil laborers is high, and they propose to complete two tasks in one. According to the statistics of the fourth brigade of She County for four days: a total of 4,544 pieces of equipment (long planks) were transported, which originally required 2,273 laborers, but they only used 2,072 laborers to complete it, saving 8% of labor. The first platoon of the first company of Licheng once accepted a task for 144 people, but they only used 68 laborers to complete it, saving 52% of labor.

　　用战地实例教育民工
    黎涉民工支援前线效率加强
    【晋中电】参加太原战役的太行涉县、黎城远征民工，加强军事常识学习，避免不应有的伤亡；并进行反逃亡的检讨，结果节省了民力，提高了效率，保持了队员情绪经常饱满。开始时，涉县民工干部存有较严重的自满麻痹思想，认为队员久经锻炼，又曾参加过平汉、豫北、上党等大战役，此次绝对不会发生什么大问题；所以领导上就没有很好的去了解和研究此次支前的特殊情况（如成员成份复杂、天气寒冷、事先准备极差等），来对民工进行教育。而在接受任务不久，一大队一人牺牲，二人负伤；再加生活寒苦，因此有些民工思想上发生了波动，个别的动摇、开小差。但这并没有引起一些干部的注意，还认为出不了大问题，甚至对支队部的指示也不加研究。直到三大队往前线运输军火被敌炮弹炸伤数人后，才引起了各级干部的普遍注意。存在的主要问题，一是队员的害怕恐慌，一是开小差人的处理。为了解决这些问题，支队部干部协同大队干部，首先研究了发生这些问题的原因，主要是缺乏军事常识不懂技术所致。检讨出这些原因后，各连联系实际进行普遍的检讨和回顾，同时又请较有军事常识的队员讲解防空避弹方法，结果使大家认识了炮弹不是那么可怕。三大队一个队员说：“那天如果咱们要分散开，听见炮声了快爬下，一定伤不了”。又一个队员说：“他们讲的对，炮弹过来都能先听到声音，如果事先留意，一听见了就隐蔽到岩下，准没事。”经过这样讨论讲解后，大家一致认为炮弹可以躲，损失可以减免。在这个基础上，又讨论了今后的办法：（一）各级干部切实负责，认真接受任务；同时干部要先选好道路和地形，确定运送办法，及行军顺序。（二）通过封锁线前，先让队员停一下，一面引起队员精神上的注意，同时告诉队员应注意事项。（三）到了我炮兵阵地，队员要原地放下弹箱立时走开，少数干部交任务。（四）每次任务完成后，都要对指挥行动进行检讨。经过这样实施后，效果很好。如一大队某连向阵地送炮弹要通过两处封锁线，但来回数次都安然度过。很多队员说：要早有这个办法，也保准出不了事情。一大队的三连队员很兴奋的说：“象这么着，我们再干两个月，什么也就学会了。”这样不仅去掉了大家的恐慌心理，而且运送效率大增。有一天晚上，叫二、三连去送弹药，二连去的早，把三连的数目都完成了。
    在处理逃亡问题上，他们首先研究了开小差回队人的思想变化过程，研究出这些民工基本上是不愿开小差的，而个别开小差的原因，一是由于恐慌害怕，一是被别人所煽动，一是由于领导上有缺点。另外，一些民工在开小差前，大都作了激烈的思想斗争，特别是光荣与耻辱，个人与大家的问题；即在逃跑后，在路上也是有很多顾虑。根据这个基本思想情况，在队内发起了普遍谈心运动，号召大家谈心事，说实在话。干部首先检讨了自己，这样启发了大家的热烈发言。五大队一连张小根说：“我在阳曲住时开了小差，说起来真丢人，我刚走到村就碰见了一个熟人，当时我连头也没敢抬，就躲到另一家去。第二天，村里召开军属和参战家属会，解决秋耕问题，我家也参加了，当时我很感动。第二天，村里就把我送了回来。现在我非常后悔，今后决不再开小差；并且从明日起，我一定要以功赎过。”三连李洛五说：“我想开了，大家都送炮弹打敌人，我装病等吃，良心上有愧；今后我一定要好好干，保险不装病了。”
    黎城为了巩固民工，提高思想认识，特提出“吃苦想灾年”、“参战想逃反”、“争取光荣”、“立功成模范”等口号。并健全会议汇报制度。现该两部已于二十天前完全消灭了逃亡，民工情绪高涨，提出两次任务一次完成。据涉县四大队四天的统计：共运器材（长板）四千五百四十四块，原须用工二千二百七十三个，但他们只用了二千零七十二个即完成了，节省了人工百分之八。黎城一连一排，一次接受了一百四十四人的任务，但他们只用了六十八个工即完成了，节省人工百分之五十二。
