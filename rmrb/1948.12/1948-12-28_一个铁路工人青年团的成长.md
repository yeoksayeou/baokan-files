　　The Growth of a Railway Workers' Youth League
　　Fang Ju
　　(I)
　　The Youth League of the Deshi and Zhengtai Railways was started by several amateur youth work comrades in June 1948. At that time, some young workers had already been organized in production, spare-time study classes, sports teams, and drama troupes, and some activists had been discovered. The League gradually developed on this basis. By October, it had 73 members, established a temporary League Committee, two branches, and eight groups.
　　Young workers on the Deshi and Zhengtai Railways account for about 20% of all employees, scattered along the 300-kilometer line at various stations and departments. Their common characteristics are: First, most of them started working during the periods of Japanese puppet regime and Kuomintang rule. Some of them were trained in technical training classes run by the Japanese, which were half-work and half-study, so they were deeply deceived and蒙蔽. Some were even forced or tricked into joining the Kuomintang Sanqing团 (Three Principles of the People Youth League). Therefore, when Shijiazhuang was first liberated, they had feelings of fear and doubt towards our Party and our army. Second, they generally have shorter lengths of service, and their technical and cultural levels are relatively low. Most of them have not yet mastered skilled techniques, so their status in production and politics is also low, which prompts most young people to actively learn technology and culture. The young workers also have a lighter burden on their families and are full of energy, which further increases the opportunities for young people to learn and progress. Third, although their class consciousness is relatively poor, they are easy to accept the truth. After a period of enlightenment and education, they can realize that they were oppressed and deceived in the past and hate the enemy, and they warmly support the Communist Party. Their work creativity and initiative are more easily developed.
　　(II)
　　Based on the above characteristics of young workers, we first established contact through the trade union and existing activists, and united them to participate in the youth "Anti-American and Pro-Japanese" movement in Shijiazhuang, listened to reports from students from Tianjin and Beijing about the student movement, and participated in youth evening parties and other activities. These activities raised the political awareness and organizational demands of young workers. At this time, we used blackboard newspapers, printed documents, and other methods to publicize the Youth League. At that time, there were three reactions: The first reaction was an urgent request to join the League, recognizing that only under the leadership of the Communist Party can young people play an active role, and believing that to improve their political awareness and improve their work and study, they should join the League. The second reaction was: feeling that they had shortcomings and were not qualified, and requesting the League to provide help. The third reaction was doubt about the League, saying: "Will there be personal freedom after joining the League? ... We work and eat, we don't participate in political parties!"
　　Although the people with the first reaction were in the minority, they were the main target for building the League. We recruited several League members on August 1st, a total of 13 people including cadre Party members, and established the League branch at the same time. We are actively educating the people with the second reaction, and some of them have already joined the League. We continue to educate the people with the third reaction, and their thinking has changed.
　　After the League was established, it relied on the League branch and League members to contact the broad masses of workers and gradually develop the League organization. In order to meet the needs of League members and young people, we have established and led the following activities:
　　1. Organized a joint "Labor Youth Society" of League members and non-League members. Published wall newspapers to publicize the League and educate young people.
　　2. The League and the Trade Union jointly organized the "Railway Youth Drama Society," with 32 people participating. And also held two sports teams (with 40 people participating), and organized a road-wide ball game and several evening parties.
　　3. Organized several forums for League members and non-League members to solicit opinions from non-League members on the work of the League, publicize the relationship between the League and the masses, and recruit new League members.
　　4. Restored and established various learning organizations one after another. Such as technical training classes in the locomotive section and machine factory, to make up for mathematics and "locomotive principle", etc. The study classes in the bureau are divided into three groups, A, B, and C, to make up for "applied mechanics", "measurement", "engineering knowledge", and "civil structure", etc. Organized study classes for odd-job personnel in the bureau, teaching literacy, abacus, and common sense, etc. And assisted in the establishment of organizations in the affiliated hospital to learn drug names and "anatomy", etc. More than 120 students participated in various learning organizations. All participated voluntarily. Teachers are composed of League members, League cadres, and hired engineering personnel, etc.
　　Through the above activities, the Youth League has taken root in the masses, united more than 500 young people, and a large number of advanced young people have applied to join the League. Many young people already think it is glorious to join the Youth League. They believe that the Youth League is their big family and a group that guarantees the progress of young people.
　　In order to train League cadres, improve the awareness of League members, and also to meet the political learning requirements of League members, we carried out political and ideological study and education, established League internal organizational life, democratic life, and study life; in addition to carrying out general political education in learning organizations, we also studied Lenin's "Tasks of the Youth League," "Summary of the Second Anniversary of the People's Liberation War," "Proposal of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the Establishment of the New Democratic Youth League" and other documents; in addition, League members sent to work in the new district studied the Party's industrial and commercial policies, and all achieved certain results. However, due to lack of experience, the League's activities among the masses were weakened and the League's influence among the masses was reduced because the League's internal political study was strengthened in order to consolidate the League, while the League neglected to educate the young masses by combining work and study in various struggles. By October, we corrected this bias.
　　(III)
　　In addition to playing a role in uniting the masses and improving culture, technology, and ability, the League has also played a certain role in other aspects:
　　For example, the League and the Trade Union jointly launched a production campaign to consolidate labor discipline. A competition for young workers to participate in 机厂打＠锯 (machine factory saw) was launched. When the Sixth Labor Congress decided that the liberated area workers should donate work and wages to help the brothers and sisters of the workers in the Chiang-controlled area, the Youth League小组 (group) of the Engineering Section first cooperated with the branch trade union, assisted the trade union in publishing a newsletter, and led all the employees of the section to respond to the call and played a leading role. Another example is that the Youth League of the Railway Hospital played a certain role in changing the style of medical care. At a meeting of drivers and stokers, one worker said many backward words. The League members immediately explained to him who was truly doing things for the people, and educated this worker. In September, when enemy planes constantly bombed Shijiazhuang, most of the League members participated in the protection groups of various departments, and many models emerged in rescuing the victims. At the end of October, when the Chiang-Fu bandit army attempted to sneak attack on Shijiazhuang, under the leadership of the Party and the administration, the temporary League Committee led the League members in Shijiazhuang to participate in the vigilante team and played a backbone role. Participated in the work of monitoring suspected elements. In the machine factory vehicle section, when the machine was disassembled and a decision was made to transfer it, workers were needed to escort the vehicle. The section chief asked the workers to voluntarily sign up. League members Wei Guan,, and Lei Laijiang took the lead in signing up, which influenced two workers to also sign up and completed the task. In October, at the first congress of railway trade union representatives, three League members (there were only 44 League members at that time) were elected as worker representatives (one representative was elected for every 50 members). The League members who set off to Yuci actively and earnestly publicized the industrial and commercial policies of the new district, and were also active in the work of repairing the railway.
　　In general, in the past six months, the railway Youth League, which has begun to grow, has laid a preliminary foundation in exploration and opened up a broad road for future work. Although much work has only just begun, many problems have not yet been found to be solved correctly, and many difficulties remain to be overcome, we believe that in the future, under the leadership of the Party, the railway Youth League will surely move forward smoothly.

　　一个铁路工人青年团的成长
    方举
    （一）
    德石、正太铁路的青年团，是由几位业余的青年工作同志从一九四八年六月份开始着手工作的。当时，在生产中、在业余学习班、球队、剧团中已组织了一部分青年工人，并且已发现了一些积极分子。团就在这个基础上逐渐发展起来，到十月份止共有团员七十三人，建立了临时团委会，建立了两个支部和八个小组。
    在德石、正太铁路的青年工人，约占全体员工百分之二十，分散在三百公里沿线各站和各个部门。他们共同的特点是：一、大部分是日伪和国民党统治时期开始做工的，其中有一部分是从日本人办的半工半读的技术学习班里培养出来的，因此受欺骗蒙蔽较深。有的曾经被迫被骗加入了国民党三青团。所以在石家庄才解放的时候，对我党我军曾存有恐惧、怀疑的心理。二、一般工龄较短，技术和文化都较低，大多数还不能够掌握熟练技术，因此在生产上、政治上的地位也低，这就促使着大多数青年成为学习技术和文化的积极分子。青工对家庭的负担也较轻，精力旺盛，这就更增加了青年学习进步的机会。三、他们的阶级觉悟虽较差，但容易接受真理，经过了一个时期的启发和教育，就能觉悟到过去被压迫、欺骗而痛恨敌人，就热情的拥护共产党。工作创造性和积极性较易发扬。
  　（二）
    根据以上青年工友的特点，我们首先通过职工会和已有的积极分子，建立了联系，并且团结他们参加了石家庄市的青年“反美扶日”运动，听取了从平津来的学生关于学运的报告，参加青年晚会等活动。从这些活动中提高了青年工友的政治觉悟和组织要求。在这个时候，我们就运用黑板报、印发文件等方法，进行了关于青年团的宣传。当时就有三种反映：第一种反映是迫切要求入团，认识到只有在共产党的领导下，青年才能发挥积极作用，认为要提高自己的政治觉悟，提高自己的工作和学习，就应该参加团。第二种反映是：认为自己有缺点，不够资格，要求团能给以帮助。第三种对团怀疑，说：“参加了团以后是否有个人自由？……我们作工吃饭，不参加党派！”
    第一种反映的人虽然是少数，但这是建团的主要对象。我们就在八月一号吸收了几个团员，连同干部党员在内共十三人，同时就建立了团的支部。对第二种反映的人是积极教育，目前已有个别的参加了团。对第三种反映的人，继续不断的进行着教育，现在在他们的思想上已起了变化。
    团成立以后，就依靠着团支部和团员，联系广大工人群众，逐渐发展团的组织。为了满足团员与青年的要求，我们曾建立并领导了如下的几种活动：
    一、组织了团和非团员联合的“劳动青年社”。出版壁报，宣传团与教育青年。
    二、团与工会联合组织了“铁路青年剧社”，共有三十二人参加。并且还举办了两个球队（有四十人参加），曾组织了全路性的球赛与几次晚会。
    三、组织了几次团员与非团员的座谈会，征求非团员对团的工作的意见，宣传团与群众的关系，并征收新团员。
    四、先后恢复与成立了各种学习组织。如机务段与机厂的技术学习班，补习数学和“机车原理”等。在局内的学习班则分甲、乙、丙三组，分别补习“应用力学”、“测量”、“工程常识”、“土木构造”等。组织了局内的勤杂人员的学习班、教学识字、珠算、常识等。并在附属医院中协助成立了学习认药名、“解剖”学等的组织。各种学习组织共有一百二十多个学生。都是自愿参加的。教员由团员、团的干部和聘请的工程人员等担任。
    经过了上述这些活动，青年团已在群众中生了根，团结了五百个以上的青年，大批的先进青年申请入团。许多青年已认为参加青年团很光荣。认为青年团是自己的大家庭，是保证青年进步的团体。
    为了培养团的干部，提高团员的觉悟，同时也为了满足团员的政治学习的要求，我们进行了政治思想的学习与教育，建立了团内组织生活，民主生活和学习生活；除了在学习组织中进行了一般的政治教育外，并学习了列宁“论青年团的任务”、“人民解放战争两周年总结”、“中共中央关于建立新民主主义青年团的提议”等文件；此外对派赴新区工作的团员，则进行了关于党的工商业政策的学习，都收到了一定的效果。但因经验缺乏，曾因加强团内的政治学习，为了巩固团，而忽略了团在各种斗争中，将工作与学习结合着教育青年群众，因而减弱了团在群众中的活动，缩小了团在群众中的影响。到十月份，我们才纠正了这个偏向。
  　（三）
    团除了在团结群众提高文化、技术、能力上曾发挥了一部作用外，在其他方面也曾表现了一定的作用：
    例如团和职工会共同发动了生产运动，巩固了劳动纪律。曾发动青年工人参加机厂打＠锯的竞赛。在六次劳大决定解放区职工捐工捐薪援助蒋管区职工弟兄时，工务段的青年团小组首先和分工会配合，并协助工会出版了快报，领导全段职工，响应了号召，并起了带头作用。又如铁路医院的青年团在改变医护作风上起了一定的作用。在司机司炉工人会议上，有一个工人说了许多落后话，团员马上就对他讲明了谁是真正为人民的事实，教育了这个工友。九月敌机不断轰炸石家庄时，团员们大部分参加了各部门防护团，在抢救被难者中出现了不少模范。十月末，蒋傅匪军妄图偷袭石家庄市时，在党和行政的领导下，临时团委会领导了石家庄市的团员们参加了纠察队，并起了骨干作用。参加了监视嫌疑分子的工作，在机厂车辆所，当拆卸了机器，决定转移时，需要工人护送车辆，所主任征求工人自愿报名，团员魏贯、、雷来江，就带头报名，影响了两个工友也报了名，完成了任务。十月，在铁路职工会首届代表大会上，有三个团员（当时只共四十四名团员）当选为工人代表（每五十会员选一个代表）。出发到榆次的团员，曾很认真的积极的宣传新区工商业政策，在修复铁路的工作中也是积极分子。
    总起来说，六个月来，开始生长的铁路青年团，在摸索中已有了初步的基础，开辟了今后工作的宽阔道路。虽然许多工作还只是开始，许多问题尚未摸到正确解决的办法，许多困难尚待克服，但我们相信今后铁路青年团在党的领导下，一定会顺利前进。
