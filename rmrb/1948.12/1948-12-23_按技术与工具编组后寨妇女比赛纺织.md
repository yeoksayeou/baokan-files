　　[Taiyue News] Under the leadership of textile hero Li Fenghua, Houzhai Village in Fushan reorganized the textile groups according to technology and tools, and launched a textile competition. On November 6th, labor hero Li Fenghua and Wang Fuquan, in coordination with village cadres, convened a winter textile mobilization meeting in Houzhai Village. Using the practical example of organizing textile production to overcome the hailstorm the year before last, and the difficulty some people felt in self-sufficiency through textile production this spring, they explained the benefits of textile work. Woman Li Yuping said: "What you said is right, we suffered from food and drink shortages this spring, wasn't that because we didn't do a good job in textile production!" Then, the county government's rewards for labor models, thirteen sickles, five towels, and a package of steel needles, were distributed to Li Maocheng, Zhang Xiusu, Bai Xiulian, and others, thirteen textile model workers of special and second and third class. This greatly stimulated enthusiasm for textile production. At this time, the women of Houzhai requested to reorganize voluntary textile groups. Based on everyone's opinions, three textile groups were formed according to technology and the tools used: six young women who knew how to use shuttle looms were put in one group, six women who used flat looms were put in one group, and seven older women who used small looms were put in one group. Niu Shanmei said: "Although we are separated, I will still take care of the sizing of the thread"; Wu Fengying said: "Whoever wants to learn the shuttle loom, I am responsible for teaching." Then everyone discussed and established methods for calculating work points for spinning, weaving, sizing, and winding. On the 10th, group leaders Li Fenghua and Wu Fengying borrowed 20 jin of cotton from the Yixin Village Cooperative, which was voluntarily taken by the women of the three groups; those who had cotton at home did not take any. During the work, everyone proposed competitions; Wu Fengying and Feng Xiuying both proposed "relying on textile production to solve all household expenses such as salt and coal, and ensuring that no grain is touched at home." Li Yueying, from Wu Fengying's group, quickly made two pairs of shoes and sold them to buy cotton, in order not to touch the grain at home. From November 10th to 20th, Wu Fengying and Niu Shanmei's groups had spun 22 jin of thread and installed one machine. The three groups installed a total of seven machines, and each machine produced more than 180 chi of cloth. By December 5th, all of it could be woven, for a total of 1,260 chi of cloth.

　　按技术与工具编组后寨妇女比赛纺织
    【太岳讯】浮山后寨村在纺织英雄李凤花领导下，按技术和工具重新组织纺织组，展开了纺织竞赛。十一月六日，劳英李凤花、王福全协同村干在后寨村召开动员冬季纺织会议，用前年冬天组织起来纺织渡过了雹灾，今年春天纺织自流就有人感到困难的实际例子，说明纺织的好处。妇女李玉瓶说：“这话说的对，今年春天少吃缺喝，还不是因为没好好纺织！”接着又把县府奖励劳动模范的十三张镰、五条毛巾、一包钢针发给了纺织特等模范李茂成、二等张秀苏、三等柏秀莲等十三人。这样，大大刺激了纺织情绪。这时，后寨妇女要求重新自愿结合纺织组。根据了大家意见，便按技术和使用工具组成了三个纺织组，学会使拉梭机的六个青年妇女合成一组，使平机的六个妇女合成一组，使小机的七个老年妇女合成一组。牛善美说：“虽然分开了，浆线我还招呼”；吴凤英说：“谁学拉梭机，我还负责教”。接着大家又讨论订出了纺、织、浆、络等折工办法。十日组长李凤花、吴凤英就到一心村合作社贷回棉花二十斤，由三个组的妇女自愿来领，自己家内有花的就不领。在做活当中，大家又提出竞赛；吴凤英、冯秀英都提出“靠纺织解决家内吃盐、烧煤等一切花钱问题，保证不动家里一颗粮食”。吴凤英组里的李月英，为了不动家里的粮食，赶快做了两对鞋卖了买花。从十一月十日到二十日，吴凤英和牛善美两组已纺线二十二斤，安了一个机子。三个组共安了七个机子，每个机子的布都在一百八十尺以上，到十二月五日可以全部织完，共可织布一千二百六十尺。
