　　Changes in the Three Years After Liberation
    I. "Little Tianjin"
    Linqing was liberated on September 1, 1945. When I visited Linqing, it had just passed its third glorious anniversary.
    Before the war, people called Linqing "Little Tianjin." When I first set foot on the pontoon bridge across the Grand Canal leading to the city, the wharf was bustling with people coming and going, and twenty or thirty large sailboats were loading and unloading goods. I thought, that's why it was called "Little Tianjin"! After a few days of visits, I learned that this was not the reason. It was not called "Little Tianjin" because of its convenient shipping and booming commerce, but because it was, like Tianjin, a market where imperialists dumped goods and absorbed raw materials. Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, imperialists such as the United States, Germany, and Britain dumped 160,000 barrels of kerosene here every year. Other groceries, from flour to superstitious items, from matches to paper, from white sugar to cosmetics, were all available. They used the method of exchanging cotton for goods to absorb a large amount of cotton. The Bank of China, which specialized in serving imperialism, also established the "China Cotton Corporation" here, using the poverty of the vast rural areas to "implement cotton planting loans." The peasants' cotton had not yet been sown, and it was already pre-entered into the warehouses of the four major families of China - imperialism. Before the incident, imperialists absorbed more than 40 million catties of cotton lint here every year, and more than 650,000 stones of wheat. At that time, there were more than 130 cotton and grain shops in the city, and 36 large commercial firms specializing in selling foreign goods. Most of the goods were shipped from Tianjin by boat. When the freight volume was large, 15 to 20 boats would pass through in one day. With the prosperity of the cotton, grain and general merchandise industries, hotels, restaurants, bathhouses, theaters, prostitutes... all developed. A year before the war, the number of merchants in the city had grown to 1,016.
    Under the dumping of foreign goods, industry could not develop: the city's self-proclaimed developed tanning industry also declined after the invasion of wool products in the 25th year of the Republic of China; with the influx of foreign yarn and foreign cloth, the spinning mill under construction was halted halfway. Before the war, there were only two "iron factories" and four oil mills in the city, as well as bamboo and wood industries of a family handicraft nature, but they were also precarious. After the Japanese invaders occupied Linqing, all the remaining industries collapsed; various "associations" and "combinations" replaced the commerce in rapid decline - this was the city of Linqing before the war.
    II. The Old City is a New City
    In the southwest of Linqing City, there is a long ridge of yellow soil, which is the remains of the city wall. The citizens call it the "Old City." In fact, the real old city is eight miles south of the city. Because the age is too long, there are no traces, and people slowly forget it. The old city now referred to is actually the new city - for three years since liberation, it has been walking on a brand new road and has indeed become a new city.
    When I first arrived in Linqing, I wandered around the streets almost every day, seeing the warehouses piled high with goods; seeing the new markets specially for rural farmers to sell local products; seeing the new buildings built next to the old city houses; and seeing the vigorous rise of industry, "Nonggong Oil Mill," "Yihua Iron Factory," "Yonghe Soap Factory," "Xinhua Cigarette Factory"... everywhere hung brand new signs. Walking into Zhugan Alley and Mutong Alley, every household's ten fingers flew, saws and drills roared, making sieves, baskets, and bellows. According to the statistics of the Bureau of Industry and Commerce, the city already has 29 kinds of industries, including oil extraction, iron industry, cigarette rolling, and bamboo and wood industry, with a total of 900 factories and workshops, and more than 4,000 employees. Among them, the cigarette, iron, and oil extraction industries have developed the fastest. There are 55 cigarette factories, and the state-owned Xinhua Machine Cigarette Factory alone produces 60,000 to 80,000 cartons of cigarettes per month, and its products sell well in major cities and towns in North China. The oil extraction industry has recovered to the four before the war (oil mill workshops have developed from 13 households before the war to 36 households). Renhe Machine Oil Factory was forced to stop work during the enemy occupation. This May, the state-owned Gongyi Store invested 50 million yuan and started work. In two and a half months, it squeezed 500 stones of rapeseed and 100,000 catties of soybeans. In mid-November, it added a 30-horsepower diesel engine to expand production. The iron industry has developed to 13 factories, with more than 50 kilns. At the time of liberation, there was only Yihua. At that time, it had 10 workers and one lathe. After cooperating with the Workers' Cooperative last year, it has developed rapidly. Now it has 103 workers, five lathes, and four rocker drills. It is already a fairly large iron factory. On November 9th, when I went to visit, the factory had already manufactured 567 cotton ginning machines, 21 cotton gins, and cast 15,000 pots this year. I asked Song Haizeng, the manager of the factory: "Why is your factory developing so fast?" "The people need it!" Manager Song said with a smile, "My cotton gin hasn't even been made yet, and it's already sold out." He was not exaggerating at all. His cotton gins have been sold south of the Yellow River. If you want to buy goods, you have to pay in advance to order them. Although he had only made 567 cotton gins when I visited him, he had already sold 627. However, Linqing does not produce coal and iron, and I am worried about his raw materials. The municipal party committee told me that the state-owned Jianhua Company will transport 12 million catties of coal to the city before the canal freezes, so there is no problem with fuel. When I went to Jianhua Company to inquire about this matter, it had already transported more than 3 million catties of coal. At the same time, in order to support the development of the bamboo and wood industry, Jianhua Company is preparing to organize a bamboo goods store to solve the raw material difficulties of the bamboo industry.
    At present, the number of industrial and commercial households in Linqing has increased from 1,016 at the time of liberation to 5,333 today, an increase of more than five times. The fastest-growing industries in commerce are freight yards, cotton and grain industries, transportation industries, and grocery industries. There are now 68 freight yards, 40 cotton shops, and 215 grocery stores. There are eight bus stations, with daily departures to Jinan, Dezhou, Handan and other places; there are 22 large stations, with more than 500 rubber-wheeled carts traveling daily to various towns and vast rural areas; the city is located at the intersection of the Grand Canal and the Weihe River, and shipping is also extremely convenient. There are often more than 300 ships passing through the city, from Hui County in the south to north of Cang County, with 40 to 50 ships docking and unloading goods in the city every day.
    Before the liberation of Jinan, the city was one of the important import and export trade cities in North China. After the liberation of Jinan, Linqing merchants, especially the merchants in the freight yard and grocery industries who had the closest relationship with import and export trade, speculated: "After the liberation of Jinan, Linqing's business will not work." Some freight yards were preparing to move to Jinan. More than two months have passed, and Linqing's business has not been "failing" as some merchants speculated, and the freight yard industry has not moved to Jinan. They have seen from their operations that the number of liberated cities and industries is increasing day by day, and they will supply more industrial products and daily necessities to the vast rural areas, and the rural areas also need to supply more raw materials and food to the cities. Linqing City, which stands in the middle of Jinan, Shijiazhuang, Handan, and Liaocheng, has become the most ideal hub and the best wheel to connect the city and the vast rural areas. Under the leadership and influence of state-owned stores and state-owned freight yards, the grocery industry has become more oriented to the countryside, and the freight yard industry is turning to inland adjustment. In the past two months, it has transported an estimated 2 million catties of cotton to Jinan, Bohai, Ji-Lu-Yu, and Jiaodong. The Huamao Freight Yard alone has transported 500,000 catties of cotton to Ji-Lu-Yu and 1 million square feet of native cloth to the Bohai region. The Shengli Freight Yard alone has transported more than 10 million catties of salt from the Bohai region, 200,000 catties of tobacco leaves from the Jiaodong region, and 3 million catties of coal from Shijiazhuang. Huamao Freight Yard is importing 8 million catties of grain from the Ji-Lu-Yu grain-producing area to the city. This is the main overview of Linqing's commerce at present. It has not only gloriously completed the import and export trade task of exporting surplus agricultural products and exchanging for necessary equipment and supplies, but more importantly, it is becoming the adjuster of materials for various liberated cities and towns. Mayor Dan said: "In the past three years, all industrial and commercial enterprises that are connected with the vast people and support rural production have developed, and conversely, they have declined." He is right. Linqing City is no longer, and will never be, a blood-sucking pan for imperialists and comprador feudal classes to plunder and exploit the countryside. The three years of liberation have made it a people's city that supports the countryside and supports production. (Tian Liu)

### 解放后三年的变化

　　解放后三年的变化
    一、“小天津”
    临清是一九四五年九月一日解放的，记者来临清访问时，她刚刚渡过她的第三个光荣节日不久。
    战前人们都把临清叫做小天津，当我第一次踏上通往市区的、横跨运河的大浮桥时，码头上人声沸扬往来匆忙，二、三十艘大帆船正在装卸货物。我想，这就是叫她小天津的原故吧！经过几天的访问后，才知道并非如此，并不是因为她船运方便，商业繁荣才叫她小天津，而是因为她和天津一样，同是帝国主义倾销商品吸收原料的市场。抗日战争前，美德英等帝国主义，仅煤油一项，每年就在此倾销十六万桶，其他杂货从面粉到迷信品，从火柴到纸张，从红白糖到化装品，无不应有尽有，它们采用以棉换货的办法，大量吸收棉花；专替帝国主义服务的中国银行更在此设立“中国棉业公司”，利用广大农村的穷困“实行植棉贷款”，农民们的棉花还没有播种，就预入中国四大家族——帝国主义的仓库了。事变前，帝国主义每年在此吸收棉绒在四千万斤以上；小麦六十五万余石。当时全市棉栈粮店达一百三十余家，专门推销洋货的商号大者有三十六家。货物大部从天津由船运来，货运多时，一天到过十五至二十只船，随着棉粮广货业的繁荣，旅店饭馆，澡塘戏院，妓女………都发展起来了，战前一年，全市商户已发展到一○一六户。
    在洋货倾销下，工业是发展不起来的：该市自称发达的硝皮业，民国二十五年毛织品侵入后也日趋萧条；随着洋纱洋布的涌入，正在建筑中的纺纱厂半路停工。战前，全市仅有两家“铁工厂”，四家油坊，和属于家庭手工业性质的竹木业，但也是风雨飘摇朝不保夕。日寇侵占临清后，残存的工业全部垮台；各种“会社”“组合”也代替了在急骤萧条中的商业——这就是战前的临清市。
    二、旧城是新城
    临清市西南，有很长的一道黄土岗，都是城墙的遗迹，市民叫它“旧城”，其实真正的旧城还在城南八里路的地方，因为年代太久，已看不见痕迹，慢慢的就被人们遗忘了。现在所指的旧城实际上是新城——解放三年来，她走着一条全新的道路，也的确成为一座新城了。
    初到临清时，记者差不多天天总在街上游览着，看到货积如山的货栈；看到专为乡村农民出售土产品的新商场；看到古老的市房旁边新建立起的楼房；更看到了工业的蓬勃兴起，“农工油场”，“益华铁工厂”，“永和造胰厂”，“新华烟厂”………到处悬挂着崭新的招牌。走入竹竿巷、木桶巷，家家户户十指飞翻，锯钻齐鸣，制造着筛篮篓子、风箱水桶。据工商局统计，全市已有榨油、铁工业、卷烟、竹木业………共二十九种工业，工厂作坊整整九百家，职工已达四千余人。其中纸烟业、铁工业、榨油业发展的最快。有卷烟厂五十五家，仅公营新华机器烟厂每月就出烟六至八万条，产品畅销华北各大城镇。榨油业已恢复到战前的四家（油磨作坊由战前十三户发展到三十六户），仁和机器油厂在敌占期间被迫停工，今年五月公营公益商店投资五千万元后开工，两个半月就榨菜籽五百石、豆子十万斤，十一月中旬又添装好一架三十马力的柴油机，以扩大生产。铁业已发展到工厂十三家，烘炉五十余座，解放时只有益华一家，那时他有十个工人，一部车床，去年和工人合作社合营后，发展急速，现在有一○三个工人，五部车床，四部摇轮钻，已经是具有相当规模的铁工厂了。十一月九日，记者去参观时，该厂今年已造弹花机五六七架，轧花机廿一架，铸锅一万五千口。记者问该厂经理宋海增：“你的工厂为什么发展的这么快呢？”“人民需要啊！”宋经理笑笑说，“我的弹花弓还没有造出来，就早卖出去了。”他没有一点夸张，他的弹花机一直销到黄河以南，想买货得先交钱订货。我访问他时虽然只造了五六七部弹花机，却已经卖出六二七部了。但临清不出煤铁，我担心着他的原料。市委告诉我，公营建华公司在运河冰封前，要运煤千二百万斤来市，燃料是毫无问题的，我去建华公司询问这件事时，他已经运到煤三百余万斤了，同时，为了扶助竹木业发展，建华公司正筹组竹货店，解决竹业的原料困难。
    目前临清工商户已由解放时的一○一六户，发展到今天的五三三三户了，扩大了五倍以上。在商业上发展最快的货栈业、棉粮业、运输业和杂货业，现已有六十八座货栈，四○户棉店，二一五户杂货庄。有八个汽车站，每日开往济南德州邯郸等地；有二二个大车站，胶轮大车五百余辆，每日来往于各城镇广大乡村；本市正跨运河卫河的交汇处，船运也极便利，南通辉县北达沧县以北，经常经过本市的船只有三百余艘，每日在本市停泊装卸货物者达四、五十艘。
    济南解放前，该市为华北重要出入口贸易城市之一，济南解放，临清商人特别是和出入户贸易关系最密切的货栈业杂货业商人，纷纷推测：“济南解放，以后临清的买卖不行了。”有的货栈准备往济南搬。时间过去两个多月了，临清的买卖并没有象有些商人推测的“不行了”，货栈业也没搬往济南，他们从经营中看出：解放的城市和工业越一天天增多，就会供给广大农村更多的工业品日用品，也需要农村供给城市更多的原料和粮食。而站在济南、石庄、邯郸、聊城中间的临清市，便成了联系城市与广大乡村最理想的中枢和最好的轮带，在公营商店和公营货栈首先带头和影响下，杂货业已更加面向农村，货栈业正转向内地调剂，两个月来，已运往济南、渤海、冀鲁豫、胶东各地棉花估计在二百万斤，仅华茂货栈就运往冀鲁豫棉花五十万斤，运往渤海区土布一百万方尺，仅胜利货栈一家即从渤海运来食盐达千余万斤，从胶东运来烟叶廿万斤，从石庄运来煤三百万斤，华茂货栈正从冀鲁豫产粮区向本市输入八百万斤粮食。这就是目前临清商业的主要概况。它不仅曾经光荣的完成了输出剩余的农产品，换回必须的器材与用品的出入口贸易任务，更重要的是她正在成为解放区各城镇物资的调剂者。丹市长说：“三年来，凡是和广大人民有联系的，支持农村生产的工商业都发展了，相反的都萧条了。”他说的很对，临清市已不再是、也永不会是帝国主义及买办封建阶级掠夺榨取农村的吸血盘。解放的三年，已经使她成为支持农村，支持生产的人民的城市了。（田流）
