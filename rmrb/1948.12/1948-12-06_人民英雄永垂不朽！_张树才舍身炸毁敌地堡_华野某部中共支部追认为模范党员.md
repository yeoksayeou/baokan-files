Xinhua News Agency, Huaihai Front, 3rd: People's hero Zhang Shucai, in the battle to annihilate Huang Botao's corps east of Xuzhou, sacrificed himself to destroy an enemy bunker and was posthumously recognized as a model Communist Party member by the Communist Party branch.

　　At 5:00 PM on November 12th, a certain regiment of a certain unit of the East China Field Army launched an attack on the defending enemy of the 484th Regiment of the 162nd Division of the 44th Army on the outskirts of Nianzhuangwei. After an hour of fighting, an enemy battalion still stubbornly held its forward bunkers, relying on the terrain. At that time, demolition man Zhang Shucai stepped forward and proactively requested the task from the company commander, saying, "Company commander! Let me go. If I, Zhang Shucai, don't blow up these forward fortifications, I will never come back!" He then picked up the explosives and quickly leaped towards the bunker complex southwest of Dazhangzhuang. At that time, the enemy did not fire a shot. When Zhang Shucai was only a dozen steps away from the bunker, three enemy soldiers suddenly jumped out of the bunker and pounced on him. At this critical moment, Zhang Shucai was not afraid. He continued to advance. He held the explosives, lit the fuse, and with all his strength rushed towards the enemy bunker, shouting, "As long as the mission is completed, it is glorious to die, come on!" When the enemy saw the fierce attack, they were so frightened that they turned around and fled into the hole. Zhang Shucai then quickly placed the explosives on top of the bunker. Immediately, there was a loud explosion, and the entire bunker was destroyed. Comrade Zhang Shucai also heroically sacrificed himself at the same time. At this time, the assault squad immediately rushed into the village from the gap blown open by Zhang Shucai and quickly resolved the battle. All the comrades in the company expressed their infinite admiration for Comrade Zhang Shucai's high degree of loyalty to the people's cause and the great spirit of heroic sacrifice, and specially suggested to the Party branch to posthumously recognize him as a model Communist Party member. This suggestion has been unanimously approved at the branch meeting.

　　Why is the People's Liberation Army able to win every battle? Why is it able to defeat enemies with superior equipment like a whirlwind sweeping away the clouds? People can find the correct answer from the great heroic actions of people's hero Zhang Shucai. Because the People's Liberation War is a great and just war, because the People's Liberation Army is the army of the people themselves, the People's Liberation Army can produce countless Communist Party members and revolutionary heroes like Zhang Shucai. Their high political consciousness has created the most important part of the great military power of the People's Liberation Army. Zhang Shucai and other tens of thousands of warriors like Zhang Shucai will be immortalized in the memory of the people.

　　人民英雄永垂不朽！
  　张树才舍身炸毁敌地堡
    华野某部中共支部追认为模范党员
    【新华社淮海前线三日电】人民英雄张树才，在徐州以东歼灭黄伯韬兵团的战役中，舍身炸毁敌人地堡，被共产党的支部追认为模范共产党员。
    十一月十二日下午五时，华东野战军某部某团，向碾庄圩外围守敌四十四军一六二师四八四团发起攻击。经一小时战斗，敌人的一个营，仍凭险据守前沿地堡。当时，八连爆破员张树才便挺身而出，主动向连长请求任务说：“连长！让我去。我张树才不炸开这前沿工事，坚决不回来！”他随即拿起炸药，飞快地向大张庄西南的地堡群跃进。当时敌人一枪未放，等到张树才离地堡只有十多步远了，三个敌兵突然跳出地堡，向他猛扑过来。在这个危急关头，张树才毫不畏怯，继续前进。他抱着炸药，拉开了导火线，拼着全身气力直向敌人地堡扑去，口里高喊着：“只要完成任务，死也光荣，你们来吧！”敌人一见来势勇猛，吓得连忙掉头逃进了洞口。张树才便迅速地把炸药放在地堡顶上，立刻一声巨响，地堡全部炸毁，张树才同志也同时壮烈牺牲。这时，突击班立即从张树才所炸开的缺口杀进庄去，迅速解决战斗。该连全连同志，对于张树才同志这种对人民事业的高度忠诚和英勇牺牲的伟大精神，一致表示无限的崇敬，特向党的支部建议追认他为模范共产党员。这个建议已在支部大会上一致通过。
    人民解放军为什么能够百战百胜呢？为什么能够战胜装备优良的敌人，象风扫残云一样呢？人们从人民英雄张树才的这种伟大的英勇行动中可以找出正确的答案来了。因为人民解放战争是伟大的正义的战争，因为人民解放军是人民自己的军队，所以人民解放军就能够产生无数张树才式的共产党员和革命英雄，他们的高度政治觉悟造成了伟大的人民解放军军事力量的最重要部分。张树才和其他成千成万的张树才式的勇士，将在人民的记忆中永垂不朽。
