[Jizhong Electric News] The masses in various counties of the Eighth District of Central Hebei are actively paying agricultural taxes. By November 22nd, 1,635 villages had completed the tax collection. Before the collection, each county held a conference of district and village cadres to implement the new tax policy, with the county directly allocating the burden to each village. Before the collection began in the villages, various mass meetings were generally held to publicize and explain the various provisions of the new tax regulations, so that the masses understood that paying taxes to the state was an obligation, initially understood the new burden policy, and, after mass discussion, identified households eligible for tax reduction or exemption, calculated the burden per mu according to the new tax regulations, and fairly and reasonably distributed the burden to each household. When the collection began, many cadres and party members took the lead in paying grain, and the peasants were also very active in paying grain. For example, in Dapitun Village, Jianguo, the 70-year-old land reform peasant Liu Shimao, despite his age, still competed with others to pay the first installment. The entire village's more than 64,000 jin of public grain was collected in full in three days, and the quality of the grain was also good. Zhou ××, the militia captain of Xiaoduli Village, Jiahe, who was allocated land during land reform, paid grain this year with particular enthusiasm. He said, "In the past, I had no land, so I couldn't pay grain even if I wanted to. Now I have land and have harvested grain, so I have to pay a bit extra!" On the day the collection began, he got up early and carried the grain to pay. After paying the required amount, he was willing to pay all the remaining grain, but the village cadres refused and he carried it back. The masses in Baitai Village, Renqiu, launched a competition in paying grain, and the grain they paid was both good and early. In general, the leadership of each county attached importance to this work, and many counties had county party secretaries and county heads personally going to the countryside to lead and assist. District-level cadres were also very active in helping village cadres, which enabled the collection work to be completed quickly and smoothly.

Some District and Village Cadres Did Not Understand the New Tax Regulations; Biases Have Been Checked and Corrected
    However, in the implementation, the Special Commissioner's Office and some counties and districts, due to insufficient control, and district and village cadres still not fully understanding the new tax regulations, the following biases occurred:

    1.  In the method of allocating burdens to households: In some villages in Jianguo, Jiahe, and Xianxian, there were instances of raising and lowering production levels. Both raising and lowering did not calculate the standard mu based on normal annual output, which is not in line with the spirit of rewarding production. In addition, some villages in the three districts of Jiahe, and individual villages in the two districts of Renhe, still allocated burdens according to the old cumulative tax method; individual villages in Qingcangjiao, Renhe, and Jianguo did not calculate output but allocated burdens according to natural mu; and most villages in Jianguo and individual villages in Xianjiao did not follow the principle of tax reduction and exemption, but evenly distributed the tax reduction and exemption quota from higher levels to each household.

    2.  Concealing land to evade burdens: The concealment of land was commonly found in the sixth district of Hejian. In the six villages that have been investigated, Bali Zhuang village alone concealed 1,500 mu; Malian Tan village in Qingcangjiao concealed seven or eight qing of land.

    3.  Over-collecting grain: Dawangdu Village, Dacheng, collected according to the old scale and paid according to the market scale, over-collecting about 3,000 jin; Dibei Village over-allocated 6,000 jin; Chen Village, Guo Zhuang, and Dagougezhuang in Renqiu all over-allocated grain, some by several hundred jin, and some by as much as 2,000 jin.

    4.  Speculation and trickery; some village cadres caused trouble: In some villages in Jianguo and Dacheng, when they saw that the market price of a certain grain was high, they asked higher authorities to reduce the amount of that grain to be paid. After the higher authorities agreed to accommodate the masses, the village cadres sold the expensive grain and bought back the cheap grain to pay; another method was to collect the money converted from rice allocated by the higher authorities all in rice, seizing the opportunity of rising and falling market prices to sell the grain and pay the money.

    The occurrence of the above biases, upon review, is mainly because some county, district, and village cadres did not sufficiently study the burden policy and instructions from higher authorities, and could not conscientiously implement them. Before implementing this work, they did not anticipate what biases might occur and take preventive measures in advance. Some county and district cadres, and even the main cadres in charge, were still unclear about the new burden methods. For example, Comrade Wang Zhenqian, the head of the Finance Section of Jianguo, guided the villages to allocate burdens according to this year's actual output instead of normal annual output; six out of nine cadres in the third district of Jiahe could not calculate the burden methods, causing biases throughout the district; some district cadres in Renhe believed that they could allocate burdens according to the old cumulative tax method. Many village cadres also had confused ideas: believing that "the meat rots in the pot" and "the wool comes from the sheep," so any method of allocation would be the same; some were trying to save trouble and did not follow the instructions of higher authorities; and individual village cadres believed that implementing livestock deduction for consumption was equivalent to investigating livestock dispatch, so they deliberately concealed livestock, causing losses to the masses.

    Based on the above situation, the Special Commissioner's Office convened a meeting of the heads of the finance sections of each county. After reporting and reviewing, it proposed improvement measures: First, open up the minds of cadres at all levels (especially village cadres), overcome the work style of seeking convenience, fearing trouble, and being careless. Second, clearly recognize that the allocation method is not just a technical matter, but a matter of policy principles, and no cadre at any level can arbitrarily change it. Third, all calculation methods that are inconsistent with the spirit of the new tax regulations, regardless of whether the grain has been paid in full, must be resolutely corrected. Those village cadres who engage in trickery and speculation, in addition to being resolutely corrected, should also be given criticism, education, or necessary administrative sanctions. Fourth, each county should organize forces, combine with the supervision of collection and storage, and conduct a comprehensive and in-depth inspection. For general biases, correct them immediately after they are discovered. For counties with larger and more numerous biases (such as Jiahe and Jianguo), convene meetings to study and review, and organize forces to go deep into districts and villages to conduct targeted inspection and correction.

    冀中八专区群众争纳农业税
    千六百村公粮入仓
    翻身农民刘世茂抢缴头份
    【冀中电】冀中八专区各县群众，积极缴纳农业税，到十一月二十二日止，已有一千六百三十五个村完成征收。在征收前，各县都召开了区村干部大会，贯彻了新税收政策，由县把各村的负担数直接分配到村。村里在进行征收以前，一般的是通过了各种不同的群众会，宣传解释了新税则的各项规定，使群众认识了对国家纳税是应尽的义务，初步明白了新负担政策，并经群众讨论了减免户，按照新税则的规定，核算了负担亩，公平合理的分配到户。在开始征收时，不少的干部党员带头缴粮，农民缴粮也很积极。如建国大皮屯村，七十岁的翻身农民刘世茂，那样大的年纪还和别人争着缴头份。全村六万四千多斤公粮，三天扫数收齐，并且粮食的质量还好。交河肖度里村民兵队长周××，土改时分了地，今年缴粮特别痛快。他说：“过去我没地，想缴粮也没有，这回我有了地又收了粮食，我得格外的多缴点！”开征的那天，他起早背着粮食去了，缴够了应纳数，剩下的粮他情愿都缴了，在村干部的谢绝下，才背了回去。任邱白塔村群众，在缴粮中开展了竞赛，缴的粮食又好又早。各县对这一工作的领导上，一般的是重视的，并有不少的县，县委、县长亲自下乡领导帮助，区级干部也很积极的帮助村干部，这就使征收工作能很快的顺利完成。
  有些区村干部不明了新税则  发生偏向已检查纠正
    但是在执行中，专署和有些县区由于掌握的不够紧，区村干部对新税则还有的不大明白，所以也发生了如下偏向：
    一、在对户分配办法上：建国、交河、献县部分村庄，发生了提高产量和降低产量的现象。提高和降低，都是没按常年产量计算标准亩，这是不符合奖励生产的精神的。另外交河三个区内的部分村庄、任河两个区的个别村，仍按过去的统累税负担办法分配；青沧交、任河、建国有个别村，是不计算产量，按自然亩分配的；建国绝大部分村庄、献交个别村，没按减免原则作，把上级减免数平均分配到各个户。
    二、隐瞒土地，逃避负担：河间六区普遍的发现瞒地，已查出的六个村，仅八里庄一个村就瞒一千五百亩；青沧交马连坦村瞒地七、八顷。
    三、多征粮食：大城大王都村，按老秤收，市秤缴，多征三千来斤；堤北村多分配六千斤；任邱陈村、郭庄、大苟各庄，都多派了粮食，有的是几百斤，有的到二千斤。
    四、投机取巧，某些村干部捣鬼；建国、大城有的村，看到市场上什么粮食价高，就向上级要求少缴那样粮食，上级为照顾群众方便应许了后，村干部们就把贵粮食卖出，买回贱粮食缴上；另一种是把上级分配的米折款，都按米征起来，抓着市价涨、落空子，把粮食卖出去缴款。
    以上偏向的发生，检讨起来主要是：有些县区村干部，对研究学习负担政策和上级指示不够，不能认真贯彻执行。执行这个工作以前，没估计到可能发生什么偏向，事先加以防止。有的县区干部甚至主管部门的主要干部，还闹不清新的负担办法。如建国财政科长王振乾同志，指导村里按今年实际产量分配，而不是按常年产量；交河三区九个干部，有六个干部不会计算负担办法，闹的全区都出了偏向；任河有的区干部，认为可以按旧统累税办法分配。村干部也有不少糊涂思想：认为“肉烂了在锅里”，“羊毛出在羊身上”，怎样分配也是一样；一种是贪图省事，不按上级指示办事；个别村干部认为实行牲口除消耗是调查牲口派出勤，因此故意隐瞒牲口，使群众吃了亏。
    根据以上情况，专署召开了各县财政科长会议，经过汇报检讨后，提出了改进办法，一、首先打通各级干部思想（特别是村干部），克服图省事怕麻烦和粗枝大叶的工作作风。二、明确认识，分配办法不光是技术，而是政策原则问题，无论那级干部，不能随便变更。三、凡是与新税则精神不符的，计算方法不对的，不管粮食是否缴齐，一定坚决改正过来，对于村干部捣鬼、投机取巧的，除坚决纠正外，还应给以批评教育或必要的行政处分。四、各县组织力量，结合督促征收入库，普遍深入检查。对一般偏向发现后，立即纠正，偏向较大而多的县（如交河、建国），应召开会议，研究检讨，组织力量，深入区村，进行有重点的检查纠正。
