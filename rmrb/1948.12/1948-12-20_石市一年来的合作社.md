The experience of the cooperative movement in Shijiazhuang City over the past year proves that vigorous efforts should be made to organize supply and marketing cooperatives and consumer cooperatives, and, where conditions permit, production cooperatives, to open up a correct path for urban cooperative undertakings. The development of cooperatives in the city can be roughly divided into four stages: The first stage was from the liberation of last year (November 12th) to the end of January this year. At that time, in order to solve the unemployment and hunger of workers and the poor caused by the rule of the Chiang bandits, and the supply of food and non-staple food in the city, cooperatives of unemployed workers, small merchants, and the poor were organized. Under military control, they were given special rights to operate transportation and sales businesses. Due to the large price difference between inside and outside the city at that time, the profits were very large, and the development was rapid. By the end of January, there were 150 cooperatives (the highest development was 182 cooperatives), with 21,625 members and 46,802,550 yuan of capital stock (Jicha, same below). The second stage was from February to the end of May. At that time, due to the end of military control and the opening of checkpoints, cooperatives no longer obtained high profits under special privileges. Workers and the poor in various industries also needed to find formal employment and make long-term plans. The leadership then called on cooperatives to switch to production businesses, to develop production and drive workers and the poor to work, and solve their livelihood problems. As a result, the number of cooperatives decreased month by month, and the number of production cooperatives increased month by month. By the end of May, there were 104 cooperatives, and production cooperatives accounted for 59 of them, and cotton weaving cooperatives accounted for 74.6 percent of the production cooperatives. Most of these production cooperatives were of the nature of raising funds to hire labor. The third stage was from June to the end of September. Most of the production cooperatives experienced sluggish sales, inflexible capital turnover, too many employees, low salaries, wasteful expenses, and unstable cadres, exposing the weaknesses of raising funds to hire labor. Although rectification was carried out, it was not resolved, so the number of cooperatives continued to decrease month by month. The fourth stage is from October to the present. Two new shoemaking cooperatives were organized to experiment with supply and marketing cooperatives. During the war preparations at the end of October, 39 cooperatives switched to wartime supply and marketing, supplying citizens with daily necessities and food, stabilizing prices, and打击了投机商人 curbing speculative merchants. There are currently 52 cooperatives, 11,358 members, and 143,453,444 yuan of capital stock.

Over the past year, the city's cooperatives have achieved results. For example, in the first stage, they supplied 2,539,714 catties of various vegetables, 768,430 catties of various grains, 421,626 catties of meat, 183,400 catties of coal, and 142,624 catties of straw to the market, thereby solving the livelihood problems of more than 20,000 unemployed workers and the poor. From the second stage to October, a large number of foreign cloth, native cloth, gauze, towels, waterwheels, paper, military shoes, etc. were produced, increasing social wealth. During the war preparations in October, 39 cooperatives supplied 7,118 bags of flour, 15,500 catties of wheat, and 17,500 catties of millet in three days, solving the daily supply needs of citizens, stabilizing prices, and training more than 200 cooperative cadres. However, many lessons have also been learned over the past year. The Shijiazhuang City Promotion Society's recent review results mainly include the following points: (1) After the end of military control, the transition to production business. This type of production cooperative can be divided into three types: The first type is the labor union of unemployed workers in the same industry. All or two-thirds or more of the members participate in the labor within the cooperative, relying on their own labor tools, skills, and a small amount of capital, and developing from small to large through hard work. This is the production organization of the producers themselves and is a true production cooperative, so it has always been consolidated and developed. The second type is composed of workers in the same industry trade union who raise funds and tools. It mainly relies on the labor of one-half or less than one-half of the labor members. Although it is also close to the organization of producers, due to the division between labor members and non-labor members, contradictions often occur between wages and labor dividends and capital dividends, which affects capital accumulation and business development. The third type is composed of people from different industries, different lifestyles, and different classes, who raise funds on a street basis and hire labor for production. Members only require dividends, and labor-management relations are difficult to resolve, resulting in business shrinkage. In short, except for the first and a few cooperatives of the second type, most of these production cooperatives are organized to use funds to exploit others and satisfy the personal dividend purposes of shareholders, rather than solving the production and livelihood problems of members with the collective interests of the cooperative, thus creating labor-management contradictions. In addition, dividends are calculated in currency to determine profits and losses, resulting in less and less capital being divided. Secondly, they do not understand the importance of helping small producers avoid or reduce exploitation by merchants, the direct supply of production and living materials to members without going through merchants, to stabilize prices and protect production. They do not understand the importance of supporting production through material circulation, and ignore market needs (such as the large-scale development of cotton weaving cooperatives) and blindly produce, abandoning the organization and leadership of supply and marketing and consumer cooperatives. Furthermore, there is a lack of investigation and research on urban cooperative work, and the error of empiricism is unconsciously committed, such as organizing production cooperatives on a street basis, developing a large number of textiles, and excessively low salaries for cadres. (2) Poor operation and management, the most important of which is that the bottom-up democratic management system has not been established or is imperfect, resulting in extravagance and waste and even corruption; secondly, egalitarianism and patronage views in the wage system, resulting in rough manufacturing and affecting sales. (3) Cooperatives should unite and transform small producers and lead them on the path of new democracy, and cannot develop their capitalist nature. This policy is not clear.

Based on the above situation and review, the Shijiazhuang City Promotion Society believes that the direction and tasks of urban cooperatives should be: First, organize small producers (independent laborers, handicraft workers, coolies, small vendors, the poor, etc.) to prevent or reduce exploitation by merchants, and support their production with supply and marketing. Experience has proved that organizing production must organize supply and marketing, and supply and marketing are the key to the development of small producers. Second, form an alliance with the state-owned economy as the foundation of the state-owned economy. Fight against illegal private capital under the leadership of the state-owned economy. Only in this way can we lead the urban economy on the path of new democracy. Third, organize laborers who have difficulty in individual production to carry out collective production on the basis of private property to improve productivity and solve their livelihood problems. In the future, we should vigorously organize supply and marketing cooperatives and consumer cooperatives, and organize production cooperatives where conditions permit. Supply and marketing cooperatives should be aimed at producers in the same industry or different industries with related businesses. The purpose is to unify the procurement of raw materials, provide members at low prices, ensure the sales of finished products, and reduce intermediate exploitation to protect and support member production. Consumer cooperatives can be organized by street (government agencies, schools, and factories are all acceptable). The purpose is to avoid or reduce exploitation by merchants, directly purchase living materials, or serve as retail stores for state-owned commercial enterprises, providing members at low prices. Production cooperatives must truly become their own production organizations. The targets are laborers in the same industry, and the business operations should be the production of goods needed by the market and that cannot be temporarily replaced by machine industry. In addition, credit cooperatives, transportation and marketing cooperatives, transportation cooperatives, etc. can be established. Fourth, the existing cooperatives should be reviewed and rectified in accordance with the above principles. Production cooperatives with little business prospects should start to transfer funds and switch to supply and marketing or consumption according to the needs of members. Those with good business prospects can increase public accumulation funds and labor members' shares to gradually become the producers' own organizations. To ensure the development of cooperatives, it is also necessary to strengthen leadership and the help of the state-owned economy. The city's promotion society should increase capital and expand supply and marketing businesses. The district promotion society should also engage in supply and marketing businesses to support cooperatives through supply and marketing. State-owned factories and state-owned commercial enterprises should supply the goods needed by cooperatives at appropriately low prices. Cooperatives should bear the task of retail sales of state-owned factories and state-owned commercial enterprises. Fifth, in the future leadership of cooperatives, it is also necessary to implement democratic centralism, and members should have full rights. In business operations, the bureaucratic style should be corrected, personnel should be streamlined, costs should be reduced, capital turnover should be accelerated, and efforts should be made to maintain capital in kind. In addition, cooperatives should have their own vertical leadership, that is, from the city promotion society (through the municipal government) to the district promotion society (through the district government) to the cooperative (through the street government). The leadership tasks are the determination of the direction plan, the management of the accounting system, the allocation and distribution of funds, the guidance of supply and marketing business, the management of the treasury, and the education and transfer of cadres.

　　石市一年来的合作社
    石家庄市一年来合作事业的经历，证明应大力组织供销社与消费社，有条件的组织生产社，为城市合作事业开辟一条正确的道路。该市合作社的发展，约分四个阶段：第一阶段是去年解放（十一月十二日）至今年一月底，当时为了解决由于蒋匪统治造成的工人贫民的失业与饥饿、市内食粮及副食品的供应等问题，开始组织失业工人、小商及贫民的合作社，在军事管制下，给予出卡特权，使其经营运销业务。由于当时市内外物价悬殊，获利很大，发展迅速，到一月底，共有合作社一五○个（最高时曾发展到一八二社），社员二一、六二五人，股金四六、八○二、五五○元（冀钞，下同）。第二阶段从二月到五月底，当时由于结束军事管制，卡子开放，合作社不再获得特权下的高额利润，各行工人及贫民也需正式就业，长期打算，领导上遂号召合作社转营生产业务，以发展生产并带动工人贫民劳动，解决其生活问题。于是总社数逐月减少，生产社逐月增加，至五月底共有一○四社，生产社即占五九社，而棉织社又占生产社的百分之七四·六。这些生产社，大部是集资雇佣劳动性质。第三阶段从六月到九月底，生产社大部发生了销路不畅，资金周转不灵，且职员多，待遇低，开支浪费，干部不安心等情况，暴露了集资雇佣劳动的弱点，虽经整顿亦未解决，所以社数还是逐月减少。第四阶段是十月到现在，组织了两个新的作鞋合作社，试验供销社。在十月底的备战中，有三十九个社转营战时供销，供应了市民日用粮食，平稳了物价，打击了投机商人。现有五二社，一一、三五八社员，一四三、四五三、四四四元股金。
    一年来该市合作社，是有成绩的，如第一阶段中，供应了市场各种菜蔬二、五三九、七一四斤，各种粮食七六八、四三○斤，肉类四二一、六二六斤，煤炭一八三、四○○斤，草一四二、六二四斤，从而解决了两万多失业工人及贫民的生活。第二阶段到十月生产了大批洋布、土布、纱布、毛巾、水车、纸、军鞋等等，增加了社会财富。在十月备战中，三十九个合作社，三天供应了面粉七、一一八袋，小麦一五、五○○斤，小米一七、五○○斤等，解决了市民的日需供应，平稳了物价，并培养了二百余合作干部。但是一年中也取得了很多教训，石市推进社日前检讨结果，主要有下面几点：（一）军事管制结束后，转营生产业务，这种生产社，约分三种类型：第一类是同一行业的失业工人的劳动组合，社员全部或三分之二以上参加社内劳动，依靠自己的劳动工具技术和少数资金，由小到大艰苦发展起来的。这是生产者自己的生产组织，是真正的生产合作社，因而它一直是巩固发展的。第二类是由同一行业工会的工人集资集工具组成的，主要靠二分之一或不足二分之一的劳动社员劳动，虽也近乎生产者的组织，但由于有劳动社员与非劳动社员之分，因而常发生工资和劳动分红与资金分红的矛盾，影响资金积累与业务发展。第三类是不同行业不同生活方式不同阶层的人，以街为单位集资组成的，雇佣劳动生产，社员只要求分红，劳资关系不好解决，因之业务萎缩。总之，这种生产社，除第一类和第二类的少数社之外，多以组织资金剥削别人，满足股东个人分红目的，不是以合作社集体的利益去解决社员的生产及生活问题，因而产生劳资矛盾，加之分红以货币计算盈亏，以致资本越分越少。其次是不懂得帮助小生产者不受或少受商人中间剥削，社员的生产资料与生活资料，不经商人直接供应，以平稳物价保护生产的重要，不懂得经过物资流转去扶持生产的重要，并忽视市场的需要（如大量发展棉织社）而盲目生产，放弃了供销与消费社的组织领导。再就是对城市合作工作缺乏调查研究，不自觉地犯了经验主义错误，把农村一套搬进城市，如以街为单位组织生产社，大量发展纺织，干部待遇过低等。（二）经营管理不善，其中最主要的是自下而上的民主管理制度未建立或不健全，因而发生铺张浪费甚至贪污等现象；其次是工资制度上的平均主义与恩赐观点，造成粗制滥造，影响销路。（三）合作社应团结与改造小生产者，使他走新民主主义的道路，而不能发展其资本主义的天性，这一方针不明确。
    根据上述情况与检讨，石市推进社认为：城市合作社的方针与任务应该是：第一、组织小生产者（独立劳动者、手工业工人、苦力、小商贩、贫民等）使其不受或少受商人中间剥削，并以供销扶持其生产。经验证明，组织生产必须组织供销，供销是小生产者发展生产的关键。第二、与国营经济结成同盟，作为国营经济的基础。在国营经济领导下和不正当的私人资本作斗争。只有这样，才能领导城市经济走新民主主义的道路。第三、组织个体生产有困难的劳动者，在私有财产基础上进行集体生产，以提高生产力，解决其生活问题。今后应大力组织供销社与消费社，有条件的组织生产社。供销社应以同一行业或业务有关的不同行业的生产者为对象，其目的为统一采购原料，廉价供给社员，保证成品推销，减轻中间剥削，以保护与扶持社员生产。消费社可按街组织（机关学校工厂均可），其目的是不受或少受商人剥削，直接采购生活资料，或作为国营商业的零售商店，廉价供给社员。生产社要真正成为自己的生产组织，对象是同一行业的劳动者，经营业务应是为市场所需要者，且是机器工业暂时不能代替者之生产。另外，可办信用社、运销社、运输社等。第四、现存合作社，应根据以上方针，加以审查整顿。业务前途不大之生产社，应开始誊出资金，按社员需要，转营供销或消费。业务前途还好者，可增加公积金与劳动社员股金，逐渐成为生产者自己的组织。为保证合作社的发展，还必须加强领导，加强国营经济的帮助。市推进社应增加资本，扩大供销业务，区推进社亦应经营供销业务，以供销扶持合作社，国营工厂与国营商业应适当的低价供给合作社需要的货物，合作社应负担国营工厂与国营商业的零收零售任务。第五、今后合作社的领导，还须贯彻民主集中制，社员应有充分的权利。在业务经营上，应纠正机关化作风，精简人员，减低成本，加速资金周转，力求实物保本。此外，合作社应该有自己的垂直领导，即从市推进社（通过市府）到区推进社（通过区政府）到合作社（通过街政府），领导任务是方针计划的决定，会计制度的掌管，资金的调拨分配，供销业务的指导，金库的管理，干部的教育调动等。
