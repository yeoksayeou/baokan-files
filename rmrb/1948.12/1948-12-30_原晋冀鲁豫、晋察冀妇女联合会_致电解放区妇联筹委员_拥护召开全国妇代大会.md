To the Preparatory Committee of the Liberated Area Women's Federation:

We were very excited to read your announcement suggesting that national democratic women's groups convene a national women's representative conference next spring. We believe your suggestion is necessary and timely. In the eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan and the current two and a half years of the People's Liberation War, the broad masses of women in North China have played and are playing a great role. Especially in recent years, in the movements of production support and land reform, the broad masses of women have been organized and bravely emerged in the struggle, demonstrating their strength and raising their level of consciousness. However, all of this is not enough compared to the needs of our People's Liberation War. The organizational strength and consciousness of the masses of women, as well as the role they play in various jobs, are still far behind the victorious situation that is changing rapidly today. In order to adapt to the needs of the national situation, so as to concentrate the fighting power of women across the country in all aspects and support our increasingly victorious liberation war; in order to improve the various shortcomings in women's work, better unite all women who oppose American imperialism, oppose feudalism, and oppose bureaucratic capitalism, and work together with the people of the whole country to overthrow the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang and establish a New Democratic China, we warmly support your proposal to convene a national women's representative conference, and agree with the various opinions you put forward. This telegram is sent specifically. We also hope that you will notify us of the number of delegates to the National Women's Congress and the methods for electing delegates as soon as possible, so that we can prepare quickly.

[Ji Central Telegram] The Ji Central Women's Federation recently sent a telegram to the Preparatory Committee of the Chinese Liberated Area Women's Federation, supporting the convening of the National Women's Congress. The telegram stated: Just as the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang is about to be destroyed, and just as the Second International Women's Congress is being held, we received the announcement from the Preparatory Committee of the Liberated Area Women's Federation regarding the convening of the National Women's Congress next spring, and we are extremely excited: because this is in line with the requirements and expectations of all peace-loving and democratic women in the country. The convening of the National Women's Congress will enable women in the Chinese Liberated Areas and the KMT-controlled areas to unite more closely, to fight for the rapid overthrow of the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, the liberation of the broad masses of women in the KMT-controlled areas, and the complete equality and freedom of women in political, economic, and social status. Therefore, in addition to firmly supporting this proposal, we will earnestly complete all the preparations we need to make: collect the hopes and opinions of women throughout the region for the conference, summarize our experiences, and exchange them with all parts of the country. At the same time, we will respond to your call with practical actions to mobilize and organize women to complete the end of land reform and strive to support the front lines.

　　原晋冀鲁豫、晋察冀妇女联合会
    致电解放区妇联筹委员
  　拥护召开全国妇代大会解放区妇联筹委会：
    我们非常兴奋地读到你们建议全国民主妇女团体明春召开全国妇女代表大会的通告。我们认为你们这个建议很必须而又适合时宜。在八年抗日战争及现在进行之两年半的人民解放战争中，华北广大妇女都曾起了并正在起着伟大的作用。尤其近几年来；在生产支前及土改各方面的运动中，广大的妇女群众有组织地英勇地涌现在斗争中来，表现了她们的力量，并提高了她们的觉悟程度。但所有这些比起我们人民解放战争的需要来还不够，从妇女群众组织力量和觉悟程度以及在各种工作岗位上所表现的作用，都还远落后于今天一日千里的胜利形势。为了适应全国形势的需要，以便从各方面集中全国妇女的战斗力，支援我国日益接近胜利的解放战争；为着改进妇女工作存在的各种缺点，更好地团结全国一切反对美帝国主义、反对封建主义、反对官僚资本主义的妇女群众，和全国人民一道共同打倒国民党反动统治，建立新民主主义中国，我们热烈拥护你们召开全国妇女代表大会的建议，并同意你们提出的各项意见，特此电达。并望将出席全国妇女代表大会的名额及代表选举办法早日通知我们，以便迅速筹备。

    【冀中电】冀中妇联会顷致电中国解放区妇联筹委会，拥护召开全国妇代大会。电文称：正当蒋介石匪帮即将灭亡的时候，正当国际妇女第二次代表大会召开之际，接到解放区妇联筹委会关于明春召开全国妇女代表大会的通告，我们异常兴奋：因为这正符合全国一切爱好和平民主的妇女的要求和期望。全国妇女代表大会的召开，将使中国解放区与蒋管区的妇女们更加紧密地团结起来，为迅速打倒国民党反动统治，解放蒋管区广大妇女，争取妇女在政治、经济、社会地位上的完全平等和自由而奋斗。因此我们除了坚决拥护这一提议外，并切实完成我们所要作的一切准备工作：搜集全区妇女对大会的希望和意见，总结我们的经验，向全国各地交流。同时更将以动员与组织妇女完成结束土改与努力支援前线的实际行动，来回答你们的号召。
