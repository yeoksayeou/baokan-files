[This Newspaper] News: The North China People's Government promulgated the following wartime border entry and exit management measures for the North China Region on the 1st:

Article 1: These measures are specifically formulated to consolidate border defense, prevent espionage and banditry, and protect the safety of merchants.

Article 2: The term "border" in these measures refers to the area where the enemy and we meet. The border with friendly liberated areas is not subject to these measures.

Article 3: All persons entering or leaving the border, with the exception of foreigners for whom there are separate regulations and collective activities of units of platoon size or above, and reconnaissance personnel dispatched by local garrison troops, must complete entry and exit procedures in accordance with these measures.

Article 4: All those leaving the border must hold an exit permit issued by the public security bureau of the county or city government. The application procedures are as follows: 1. Inland merchants and civilians must obtain it from the county or city public security bureau with the introduction of their original village (street) government. 2. Jiang-controlled area merchants who frequently travel to and from the enemy and our areas, who wish to exit after entering the country, must have a guarantee from a shop and obtain it from the county or city public security bureau with the introduction of the village (street) government. 3. Organ personnel must obtain it from the county or city public security bureau or above with the introduction of their employing organ. 4.

Article 5: All those entering the border must apply for an entry permit from the public security police station in the border area. This entry permit must be cancelled with the local public security department upon arrival at the destination, and residency procedures must be completed.

Article 6: Merchants who frequently engage in import and export trade in the interior must register with the county and city industrial and commercial bureaus (sections) and obtain an import and export trade certificate. With this certificate, they can apply to the county and city public security bureau for a long-term entry and exit permit. This entry and exit permit shall be exchanged every three months and shall be released by the public security police station in the border area after inspection upon entry and exit.

Article 7: All those entering or leaving the border must pass the inspection of the public security police station in the border area before being allowed to pass. The scope of inspection includes the person himself, his accompanying vehicles, boats, personnel, and horses, and all items carried with him. This border inspection shall be limited to once per person in principle and shall be implemented jointly by the public security police station and the local industrial and commercial department. No other agency shall have the right to carry out this inspection except for the public security police station.

Article 8: The public security police station in the border area may temporarily detain anyone who falls under one of the following circumstances: 1. Those who want to leave the country without an exit permit or refuse to apply for an entry permit. 2. Those who forge entry and exit permits and certification documents of this area. 3. Those who refuse to accept inspection or even insult inspectors. 4. Those who privately take out of this area documents and charts related to the leakage of military and political secrets. 5. Those who privately bring into the country anti-revolutionary books and documents for the purpose of propaganda. 6. Those who privately carry military fire weapons in and out of the country. 7. Those who privately carry contraband in and out of the country. 8. Those with major suspicion of being spies or bandits.

Article 9: The persons temporarily detained in the preceding article shall be sent to the nearby county or city public security bureau or the public security sub-bureau in the border area, together with their documents or stolen goods, within 24 hours. After investigation and verification, they shall be sent to the judicial organs or military judicial organs for handling. Those who violate the regulations on import and export goods tax and privately transport contraband or smuggle and evade taxes shall be inspected together with the personnel of the industrial and commercial department, and the persons and goods to be dealt with shall be transferred to the nearby industrial and commercial department for handling.

Article 10: If there is illegal inspection, or it is believed that the verification of the public security police station in the border area violates the people's human rights and property rights, the person being inspected may appeal to the judicial organ.
