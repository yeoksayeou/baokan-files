First Understand the Demands of the Masses
Chengguan Work Group Ends Land Reform, Finds a Way Forward

[This newspaper dispatch] (Jizhong Daobao) news: The Chengguan Village Branch in Hejian was established in 1943 and has a total of thirty-one party members, mostly from middle peasant backgrounds, with a vague class standpoint. The village's representative assembly was not democratically elected and acted improperly, causing widespread dissatisfaction among the masses. Although the land reform last winter and this spring achieved considerable results, the work was very chaotic. Fifteen middle-peasant households were wrongly struggled against. The fruits of the struggle were stolen, lost, or over-occupied and wasted by cadres, resulting in significant losses. The poor and hired peasants held a winter meeting but gained nothing, and the masses' morale was low.

After the work group arrived in the village, the first stumbling block they encountered was that the cadres were aloof and uncooperative, and the masses were unwilling to approach them. Because the branch committee members were dissatisfied with the initial party rectification, they developed doubts about the leadership and were unwilling to work. Some representatives of the representative assembly, feeling they had problems themselves, also expressed coldness and uncooperativeness towards the work group. The cadres of the work group saw a group of people standing on the street chatting idly, and when they tried to strike up a conversation, the people scattered one by one. Seeing this phenomenon, the work group felt there was a story behind it and immediately conducted an investigation. At first, they asked the party members, who said, "We didn't know anything about the land reform." Later, they asked the representatives, but didn't obtain any materials either. Afterwards, they investigated the accounts of last year's achievements and registered the class composition of cadres both inside and outside the party. During the registration, some cadres said, "Our village just can't figure out how to classify classes; who knows who is what kind of peasant!" They also conducted in-depth individual understandings, combined with explanations and mobilization, and only then discovered the general situation of the land reform and the demands of the masses.

Based on the actual situation of the village, the work group first convened a branch committee meeting, clearly announcing the call to end land reform and that the branch should play a core leadership role in ending it; in leading the end of land reform, the party's prestige should be established. At the mass meeting, it was also explained that the work group had returned to the village to resolve the problems left over from the land reform, to clarify class distinctions, distribute floating wealth, and issue land certificates. As soon as this was said, some people said, "Quick, tell us about class classification!"

During group discussions on how to end land reform, many peasants expressed dissatisfaction with the cadres of the representative assembly. Some remained silent, while others were unwilling to directly express their inner thoughts, but instead said circuitously, "Some people have a chairman, some people have big cadres; whoever messed it up should be called to unravel it! But there's one thing: I'm afraid that the more he unravels, the more chaotic it will become." Based on the masses' dissatisfaction and distrust of the representative assembly, the work group proposed reorganizing the original representative assembly and establishing a temporary committee to end land reform. Everyone could re-elect representatives and replace those they didn't like. This was in line with the masses' opinions, so twenty-two more representatives were elected, establishing the committee to end land reform. The representatives expressed their attitude to the masses: they must be selfless and impartially resolve the problems left over from land reform. Now the newly elected representatives are starting to sort out the spoils, preparing to lead the peasants in assessing classes, distributing floating wealth, and issuing land certificates.

### 首先了解群众要求　城上工作组结束土改找着门路

　　首先了解群众要求
    城上工作组结束土改找着门路
    【本报讯】冀中导报消息：河间城上村支部，一九四三年建立，共三十一个党员，成份大部是中农，阶级立场模糊。这村的代表会，没经过民主选举，办事很不正派，广大群众不满。去冬今春土改，虽也获得不少成绩，但工作十分混乱，有十五户中农被错斗，斗争果实被偷、丢掉、或干部多占、浪费，损失很多。贫雇农开了一冬会，没落下什么东西，群众情绪不高。
    工作组到村后，首先碰到的钉子是：干部疏远支应，群众不愿意接近。支委党员由于对初步整党不满，对领导上发生怀疑，不愿工作。代表会某些代表，觉得自个有毛病，对工作组也表示了冷淡和支应。工作组的干部，见街上站着一堆人闲说话，想趁过去闲扯，人们一见就一个个的溜走了。工作组见到这种现象，觉得里面有故事，马上进行了调查研究。开头问党员，党员们说：“土改时候的事俺们全不知道。”以后问代表，也没有得到什么材料。以后就调查去年的果实账目，登记党内外干部的阶级成份。在登记中，有的干部就说：“俺村就弄不清怎么着划阶级，谁知道谁是什么农！”又进行了深入的个别了解，结合着解释动员，这才发现了土改中的大概情况和群众要求。
    根据这村的实际情况，工作组首先召开了支委会，明确宣布结束土改的号召支部在结束土改中起核心领导作用；在领导结束土改中，树立起党的威信来。在群众大会上，也说明工作组这回到村，是为了解决村里土改时留下的问题，划清阶级、分浮财、发土地证。这么一来，有的就说：“快给俺们讲讲划阶级的事吧！”
    在分组讨论怎样结束土改时，好多农民对代表会的干部不满意。有的不说话，有的不肯直接了当的说出心里话，却拐着弯说：“有人家主席，有人家大干部，谁弄的就叫谁撕捋吧！？可是有一样，就怕他越撕捋越乱糟。”工作组根据群众不满意和不信任代表会的情况，就提出改组原来的代表会，成立临时的结束土改委员会，大伙看着谁不好，可以另选代表把他换下去。这样正合乎群众的意见，于是又选了二十二个代表，成立起结束土改委员会。代表们向群众表明了态度：一定要大公无私，把土地改革中遗留下的问题处理清楚。现在新选出的代表们，正在着手清理果实，准备领导农民评订阶级，分浮财，发土地证。
