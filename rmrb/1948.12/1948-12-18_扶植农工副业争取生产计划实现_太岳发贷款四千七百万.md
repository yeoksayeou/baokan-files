　　Supporting Agricultural and Industrial Sidelines to Strive for the Realization of Production Plans
  　Taiyue Issues 47 Million in Loans
    [Taiyue Electricity] In order to develop agricultural, industrial, and sideline production, the Taiyue District Branch of the North China Bank issued 47 million in production loans (new currency, same below). Regarding agricultural production loans: The Taiyue District requires that agricultural production increase by 10% next year, reaching 85% of pre-war levels. To this end, it is necessary to solve the difficulties of agricultural implements and livestock. According to surveys in various regions, existing agricultural implements generally account for one-third of pre-war levels, and it is required to double them next year. The majority of those who lack agricultural implements are newly turned-over households, among which the repair and replacement of small agricultural implements is far easier, while the repair and replacement of large agricultural implements is more difficult. Therefore, loans are mainly for the purchase of large agricultural implements and to support iron and wood factories to manufacture agricultural implements in large quantities, selling or lending them to the masses. At the same time, a portion must be purchased from outside the region. Therefore, it is determined that the annual agricultural implement loan is 7 million, and 4 million is now being issued first. In terms of livestock: Next year, it is required to increase by 7,000 to 8,000 heads. To this end, bank loans are also divided into three types: The first is transportation: mainly relying on trade companies and farmers' own funds; therefore, the bank only issues 4 million. The second is breeding livestock: It is planned to raise 600 heads in Qin County, Anze, and Fushan counties, requiring a loan of 1.5 million. In addition, 100 insemination stations will be supported throughout the district, with a planned loan of 1 million for support. The third is purchase: mainly relying on farmers' own funds, therefore 1.5 million is issued. In total, the annual livestock loan is 9 million, and 4.5 million is currently being issued first. Fertilizer and workshop loans total 5 million. This type of loan is mainly placed on supporting oil presses: It is planned to restore and establish 500 oil presses throughout the district, with a loan of 4.5 million; secondly, it is planned to restore and establish 400 flour mills, requiring a loan of 500,000. In terms of water conservancy loans: Because it is required to increase paddy fields by 40,000 mu next year, it is necessary to vigorously support the restoration and repair of old canals and waterwheels, and to experiment with opening up new canals, it is decided to issue a loan of 6 million. In addition, in order to increase farmers' sideline income and benefit agricultural production, it is determined to issue a transportation loan of 10 million. In total, agricultural sideline loans amount to 37 million.
    On industrial loans: It is required that next year's coal industry output recover to 60% of pre-war output, the iron industry recover to 35% to 40% of pre-war output, the silk weaving industry recover to 70% of pre-war output, and papermaking is required to exceed pre-war levels by 20%. To achieve the above objectives, it is determined to issue an annual industrial loan of 10 million. The method of issuance is based on different regions, different seasons, with separate and focused loans, opposing average dispersion. The support for the iron industry is focused on the development of small blast furnaces, with a plan to support 147 small blast furnaces, requiring funds of 2.06 million, accounting for more than 40% of the total iron industry loan.

　　扶植农工副业争取生产计划实现
  　太岳发贷款四千七百万
    【太岳电】为了发展农业、工业及副业生产，华北银行太岳区行发放生产贷款四千七百万（新币、下同）。关于农业生产贷款方面：太岳区要求明年农业生产增加一成收成，即达到战前的八成半。为此，必须解决农具、牲口等困难。根据各地调查，现有农具一般的占战前三分之一，要求明年增加一倍。而缺乏农具的大部分又是新翻身户，其中对小农具的修置远比较容易，而大农具的修置较困难。所以贷款主要是添置大农具，并扶植铁、木工厂大量制造农具，卖给或贷给群众。同时还要向外区购买一部。因此，确定全年农具贷款为七百万元，现在先发放四百万元。在牲畜方面：明年要求增加七千头到八千头。为此，银行贷款亦分三种：第一种是贩运：主要靠贸易公司与农民自己的资金；所以银行仅发放四百万元。第二种是繁殖牲畜：计划在沁县、安泽、浮山等三县伴养六百头，需贷款一百五十万元。另外全区扶植配种所一百个，计划贷一百万元来扶植。第三种是购买：主要依靠农民自己资金，因此发一百五十万元。总计全年牲畜贷款共九百万元，目前先发放四百五十万元。肥料与作坊贷款共五百万元。这种贷款，主要放在扶植油坊上：全区计划恢复与建立油坊五百所，贷款为四百五十万元；其次粉坊计划恢复建立四百所，需贷款五十万元。水利贷款方面：因为明年要求增加水田四万亩，所以需大力扶植恢复修旧水渠与水车，并试验开辟新水渠，决定发放贷款六百万元。另外为了增加农民副业收入，和有利于农业生产，确定发放运输贷款一千万元。总计，农副业贷款三千七百万元。
    在工业贷款上：要求明年煤炭业产量恢复到战前产量的百分之六十，铁业恢复到战前产量的百分之三十五到四十，丝织业恢复到战前的百分之七十，造纸要求超过战前水平百分之二十。为达到上述目的，确定全年发放工业贷款一千万元。发放的办法，根据不同地区、不同季节、有分别有重点的贷出，反对平均分散。而对铁业的扶植，又是以发展方炉为重点，计划扶植方炉一百四十七座，需资金二百零六万元，占全部铁业贷款的百分之四强。
