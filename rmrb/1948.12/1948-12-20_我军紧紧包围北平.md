At the beginning of this month, from the 7th to the 12th, war clouds opened on the Ping-Sui Railway: As soon as our army's iron fist struck out, the Five Master Bandit Troops collapsed; controlling the Ping-Sui Railway, isolating Zhangjiakou, seven divisions are surrounded inside and cannot get out! Following this, war began around Beiping, and successively Mi Yun, Huairou, Tongxian and Shunyi were captured. Nankou, Changping and Shahe were all liberated, along with Fengtai, Wanping, Changxindian and Langfang. Our army drove straight to the outskirts of Beiping, closely surrounding Fu Zuoyi, the traffic between Beiping and Tianjin was completely cut off, and even trying to escape by plane is impossible! With the storm intensifying, the boat is also broken, and the Tianjin Chiang bandits are also in a chaotic mess! Tangshan, Lutai, and Hanzhan have all been lost, and the Liberation Army is still pursuing closely, without any mercy. Bandit Fu sits in Beiping, deeply worried: it is clear that Tanggu and Tianjin will also be lost soon.

　　我军紧紧包围北平
    本月初七到十二，平绥路上战云开：我军铁拳刚出手，五师傅匪就垮台；控制平绥路，孤立张家口，七个师包围在内出不来！接着北平周围战争起，连下密云、怀柔、通县和顺义，南口、昌平、沙河齐解放，还有丰台、宛平、长辛店和廊房。我军长驱抵平郊，紧紧包围傅作义，平津交通全断绝，想坐飞机逃走也不招！风浪急来船又烂，天津蒋匪也一团糟！唐山、芦台、汉沾都丢了，解放军依然追赶不轻饶。傅匪坐在北平心发急：眼看塘沽、天津也不保。
