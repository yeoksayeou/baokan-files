　　A Cow Gives Birth to Cows: Five Head in Three Years
　　In Xijiujia Village, Shahe Third District, Taihang, there are a total of 170 households. In the past few years, due to the enemy's crazy looting, livestock were very scarce. According to statistics from 1945, the village had less than one head of livestock for every two households. This made fertilizing and cultivating the land very difficult, greatly reducing harvests. After liberation, with the support of the democratic government, livestock developed rapidly, especially female livestock. According to statistics from the past three years, the village's livestock has increased to 187 head, averaging more than one head per household. From January to September this year, the village's 60 female donkeys gave birth to 24 foals, and 13 cows gave birth to 7 calves. In nine months, a total of 31 young livestock were added. In particular, Liu Jinben bought two cows in the winter of 1944-45, and they have now given birth to three, developing into five. Hou Jun's donkey gave birth to two foals in two years and will be usable after three years.

　　母牛生母牛三年成五头
    太行沙河三区西九家村，共一百七十户，前几年因破敌人疯狂抢掠，牲畜很缺乏，据四五年统计，全村每两户不合一头牲口，所以造肥、耕种地很困难，减少收成很多。解放后在民主政府扶持下，牲畜发展很快，特别是母畜，近三年统计全村牲畜增到一百八十七头，平均每家一头多，今年正月到九月，全村六十个母驴就下小驴驹二十四个，十三个母牛下了七个小牛。九个月共增小牲口三十一头。特别是刘进本四五年冬买了母牛两头，到现在已下了三个，现已发展成五个了。侯俊的一头母驴，两年下了两个小驴，三年后就能使用。
