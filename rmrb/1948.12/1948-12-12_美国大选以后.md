    After the American Election
    Ke Bonian

    The result of the American election on the second of last month was that Truman defeated Dewey. In the congressional and senatorial elections, the Democratic Party also won a majority. After this election, the situation and tasks facing the progressive forces in the United States are now even clearer.

    The Democratic and Republican parties, Truman and Dewey, are all tools of American monopoly capital. No matter which party comes to power, the policies it implements will inevitably be reactionary policies that are aggressive externally, oppressive internally, anti-Soviet, anti-communist, and anti-people. There is no essential difference between them. Why did Truman win this election? This is because the vast majority of American voters have not yet freed themselves from the shackles of historical tradition, have not yet jumped out of the trap of the two parties, and still believe in some of Truman's deceptive rhetoric. Although most of them loathed the Republican Party that controlled the 80th Congress and had no good feelings about the performance of the Truman government, which had been in power for more than three years, they could only make a so-called "choose the lesser of two evils" choice and had not been able to resolutely abandon the Democratic and Republican parties and vote for the newly established Progressive Party, which opposed the reactionary policies of monopoly capital. The reason they felt that Truman was the “lesser” evil was because Truman, in this campaign, used the image of the New Deal and peace to deceive the people, while Dewey did not even do this kind of deception. Since the Republican Party took control of the 80th Congress in 1947, Truman has consistently used attacks on the reactionary record of Congress as his campaign capital. Although he once undermined the railway workers' strike and the coal miners' strike, he also once pretended to veto the Taft-Hartley anti-labor law to please the 15 million union members. Although he abolished price controls, he repeatedly proposed legislation to the Republican-controlled Congress to curb inflation in order to please the common people. Although he condoned the War Department's maintenance of racial segregation in the military, he also proposed a bill of rights to please the 12 million Black people. Although he ousted the main figures of the New Deal from the government after succeeding Roosevelt as president, he convened a special session of Congress in July and presented it with a ten-point program of the New Deal to please the people who missed the New Deal. Although he had put forward the Truman Doctrine against the Soviet Union and against the world democratic movement, on the eve of the election, he announced that he would send Vinson as a special envoy to the Soviet Union for negotiations in order to please the peace-loving and anti-war voters across the country. He relied on these tricks to deceive the voters and defeat Dewey. However, the votes cast by American voters for Truman did not indicate that they supported Truman, but only that they deeply resented and spurned the Republican Party and Dewey, the more blatant reactionaries, and only reflected their desire for democracy and peace, to the point of lightly believing in Truman's campaign promises and ignoring his reactionary essence.

    In this election, the Progressive Party, which cooperated with the Communist Party of the United States on a certain peaceful and democratic program, won more than 1.1 million votes. Although this number is not large, its significance is great. The Progressive Party was only established a few months ago and has been subjected to various forms of sabotage, destruction, and persecution by the reactionary authorities. There are no national media outlets to publicize it. It has not yet been legally recognized in some states, and the fascist, anti-communist, and anti-people atmosphere in the United States makes it dangerous for those who openly support the Progressive Party to lose their jobs at any time. Under these extremely unfavorable conditions, there were still more than one million people who voted for Wallace, which shows that the number of voters who support the Progressive Party far exceeds this number. This also shows that these more than one million voters are truly conscious and courageous people, the majority of whom are not afraid of oppression, are not deceived, and dare not only to support the American Progressive Party, but also to fight hand in hand with the American Communist Party. They will constitute a strong foundation for the future progressive movement in the United States. After the end of the election, with these more than one million activists as the core for developing the future progressive movement in the United States and uniting the broad masses of the American people, this foreshadows the bright future for the peaceful and democratic struggle of the American working class and the American people to have broad development.

    The "victory" gained by Truman is not solid and can be completely defeated. It has only been a short month from the end of the election to the present, but Truman has already used his own hands to tear off the mask of his campaign promises. Truman, now as in the past, continues to follow the will of the American monopoly capital group. In foreign policy, Truman is still pursuing an aggressive policy of preparing for a new war, actively plotting to conclude a so-called "North Atlantic Alliance," clamoring for an "arms race," continuing to split Germany and supporting reactionaries in various countries around the world, and continuing to aid the Kuomintang reactionary government of China with arms, supplies, naval, land, and air forces, and various kinds of advisors. In domestic policy, Truman is still implementing fascist measures, persecuting progressive parties and groups, strangling democracy, and continuing to carry out a frantic attack on the working class in particular. Truman had promised in his campaign platform to abolish the Taft-Hartley anti-labor law, but is currently drafting a similar substitute - a Taft-Hartley anti-labor law that is milder in form. At the same time, Truman is further buying off the right wing of the upper echelons of trade unions in an attempt to turn the trade unions into tools used by American monopoly capital. The first person Truman met after the election was Murray, the chairman of the CIO, and at the CIO annual meeting held half a month after this meeting, Murray delivered a vicious anti-communist speech and instigated the annual meeting to pass a reactionary foreign policy proposal.

    In this situation, the organized progressive forces in the United States, after the end of the election, have to make arduous efforts to break through the numerous obstacles and persecutions of the reactionary authorities, lead the broad masses of the people to oppose new wars and all reactionary measures, and guide them to get rid of the shackles of the traditional two-party system. The progressive forces in the United States are leading the people to wage a resolute struggle to force Truman to fulfill all his campaign promises, in order to raise the political consciousness of the people. This is because only by seizing the facts of every violation of his campaign promises by the Democratic Party and Truman to educate the masses can we break the illusions they held about the Democratic Party and Truman in this election campaign. Only by resolutely leading the masses to fight for the requirement that Truman fulfill his campaign promises can the Communist Party of the United States and the Progressive Party establish close ties with the broad masses of the people and unite them around the Communist Party of the United States and the Progressive Party. It can be predicted that as long as they persevere in their work tirelessly and persistently, the American progressive forces, which inherit the tradition of Roosevelt's New Deal and advocate international peace and cooperation, will definitely win the support of the broad masses of the American people who miss the New Deal and oppose war.

    The American working class is of course the basic force of the American people's progressive movement. In order to actively lead the broad people's movement to strive for peace and democracy, the conscious workers of the United States must first unite and consolidate their own revolutionary ranks and use independent communist ideology to educate and arm their own ranks. In this respect, the American working class cannot rely on the general high-level leading organs of the trade unions. On the contrary, because the American reactionary authorities are implementing extremely vicious anti-labor measures, because of their shameful policy of buying off and the degeneration and betrayal of the right-wing leaders of the American trade unions, the trade unions, which have more than 15 million members, are in danger. Therefore, how to strengthen independent communist propaganda, education, and organizational work among the working masses in the future in order to raise their class consciousness, how to lead the working masses to oppose the policy of the upper echelons of trade unions to compromise and surrender to monopoly capital in order to win the progressive leadership of the trade unions, and how to launch the workers' economic and political struggles in order to safeguard the workers' basic livelihood and basic rights cannot but become important tasks of the Communist Party of the United States and the progressive elements of the trade union movement.

    There is no doubt that the tasks facing the American progressive forces are still complex and difficult. But these difficulties can only be temporary, because the tide of the people towards democracy, peace, and progress cannot be stopped by any evil forces. From the daily events at home and abroad, the working class and the masses of the people cannot but gradually realize the truth that reactionary forces must be defeated and can be defeated, and cannot but gradually realize the corruption of the capitalist system and the brightness of the socialist system. Under the present conditions in the United States, although this process of understanding is often slow, tortuous, and latent, new historical events can accelerate this process tenfold. With the universal demand of the broad masses of the people for the New Deal and peace, with the Communist Party of the United States, the Progressive Party, and all progressive organizations as the backbone of the people's democratic and peaceful struggle, with the upsurge of the people's democratic movement throughout the world, and with the inescapable crisis faced by the international reactionary forces, especially the American reactionary forces, the reactionary rule of American monopoly capital will eventually be overthrown.

    美国大选以后
    柯柏年
    上月二日美国大选的结果，杜鲁门打败了杜威。参众两院的议员竞选，民主党也占了多数。在这个选举以后，美国进步力量所面对着的形势和任务，现在是更加明显了。
    民主党与共和党，杜鲁门与杜威，都是美国独占资本的工具。不论哪一党上台，所执行的政策，都必然是对外实行侵略、对内实行压迫的反苏、反共、反人民的反动政策。它们之间，并没有任务本质的差别。为什么杜鲁门在这次选举中获胜呢？这是因为美国绝大多数的选民，还没有摆脱历史的传统的束缚，还没有跳出两党的圈套，还相信杜鲁门的某些欺骗词令。他们大多数虽然痛恶那控制第八十届议会的共和党，对执政三年多的杜鲁门政府的政绩也没有什么好感，但他们还只能作所谓“两害相权取其轻”的选择，尚未能决然抛弃民主、共和两党而改投新成立的、反对独占资本的反动政策的进步党的票。他们之所以觉得杜鲁门的害比较“轻”一点，是因为杜鲁门在这次竞选中，以新政的姿态、以和平的姿态，来欺骗人民，而杜威却连这种欺骗也没有做。自从一九四七年共和党控制了第八十届议会之后，杜鲁门就一贯地以攻击议会的反动记录，作为他的竞选资本。他虽然曾经破坏过铁路工人罢工和煤矿工人罢工，但他亦曾一度装模作样地否决过塔夫脱哈特莱反劳工法，以讨好一千五百万的工会会员。他虽然曾经废除物价管制，但他又屡次向共和党控制的议会建议立法抑制通货膨胀，以讨好平民。他虽然坐视陆军部在军队中保持黑人隔离制度，但又提出人权法案，以讨好一千二百万黑人。他虽然在继罗斯福为总统后把新政主要人物赶出政府，但在七月间又召集议会特别会议，向它提出新政的十点纲领，以讨好怀念新政的人民。他虽然曾经提出反对苏联反对世界民主运动的杜鲁门主义，但他在大选前夕却宣布将派文森为特使前往苏联谈判，以讨好全国的爱好和平、反对战争的选民。他是依靠耍这些手腕，欺骗了选民，打败了杜威。可是，美国选民投杜鲁门的票，并不是表示他们拥护杜鲁门，而只是表示他们对共和党和杜威这个更加明目张胆的反动派的深恶痛绝和唾弃，只是反映了他们渴求民主和平的愿望，以至轻信了杜鲁门的竞选诺言，而忽略了他的反动实质。
    在这次选举中，与美国共产党在一定的和平民主纲领上合作的进步党获得一百一十多万票。这个数目虽然不大，但是它的意义却很大。进步党成立不过几个月，就受到反动当局各种破坏、摧残和迫害，全国各地又没有什么言论机关为它宣传，在某些州还没有获得法律上的承认，而且美国的法西斯的反共、反人民的气氛使得公开表示拥护进步党的人随时有丧失其职业的危险。在这种种极端不利的条件下，居然还有一百多万人投华莱士的票，这就说明了拥护进步党的选民远远超过此数。这也就说明了这一百多万个投票者乃是真正有觉悟有勇气的人，他们中的多数，是不怕压迫，不受欺骗，不但敢于拥护美国进步党，而且敢于与美国共产党携手奋斗的人。他们将构成今后美国进步运动的坚强的基础。在大选结束之后，有这一百多万积极分子作为发展美国未来的进步运动和团结美国广大人民的核心，这就预示着美国工人阶级和美国人民的和平民主斗争将有广阔发展的光明前途。
    杜鲁门所获得的“胜利”是不巩固的，是完全可以击破的。从选举结束到现在，还只有短短一个月，但杜鲁门已用自己的手摘下了他竞选诺言的假面具。杜鲁门现在和过去一样，继续秉承美国独占资本集团的意志。在对外政策上，杜鲁门仍然执行新战争准备的侵略政策，积极策动缔结所谓“北大西洋联盟”，叫嚣“军备竞赛”，继续分裂德国和支持世界各国反动派，继续用军火、物资、海陆空军和各色顾问援助中国的国民党反动政府。在对内政策上，杜鲁门仍然实施法西斯措施，迫害进步的党派团体，绞杀民主，尤其向工人阶级继续实行疯狂的进攻。杜鲁门在其竞选政纲中曾允诺废除塔夫脱、哈特莱反劳工法，但目前却在草拟一个类似的代替品——形式上较温和的塔夫脱、哈特莱反劳工法。杜鲁门同时进一步收买职工会上层的右翼，企图将职工会变成美国独占资本的御用工具。杜鲁门在选举后第一个接见的便是产联主席莫莱，而莫莱在这次接见后半个月召开的产联年会上，即发表了恶毒的反共演说，并策动年会通过了反动的外交政策提案。
    在这种情况下，美国有组织的进步力量，在大选结束以后，不得不作艰苦的努力，冲破反动当局的重重障碍和迫害，领导广大人民反对新战争和一切反动措施，并引导它们摆脱传统的两党制的束缚。美国的进步力量正在领导人民为逼迫杜鲁门实践其竞选的一切诺言而进行坚决的斗争，借以提高人民的政治觉悟。这是因为，只有抓住民主党、杜鲁门对其竞选诺言之每一件破坏的事实，来教育民众，才能打破他们在这次选举运动中对民主党、对杜鲁门所抱的幻想。只有坚决领导民众为要求杜鲁门实践其竞选诺言而斗争，美国共产党和进步党才能与广大人民众建立起密切的联系，才能把他们团结在美国共产党和进步党的周围。可以预料，只要不屈不挠地、再接再厉地坚持工作下去，继承罗斯福新政传统和主张国际和平合作的美国进步力量，一定能获得美国怀念新政、反对战争的广大人民之拥护。
    美国工人阶级当然是美国人民进步运动的基本力量。美国的觉悟的工人，为了积极领导争取和平民主的广大人民运动，不得不首先团结和巩固自己的革命队伍，用独立的共产主义思想来教育和武装自己的队伍。美国工人阶级在这一方面没有可能依靠一般的职工会的高级领导机关。相反地，由于美国反动当局实行穷凶极恶的反劳工措施，由于他们可耻的收买政策和美国职工会右翼领袖们的蜕化和叛变，拥有一千五百多万会员的职工会，正处在危险中。因此，今后如何在工人群众中加强独立的共产主义的宣传、教育和组织工作，以提高他们的阶级觉悟，如何领导工人群众反对职工会上层分子向独占资本妥协、投降的政策，以争取职工会的进步领导，如何发动工人的经济和政治斗争，以维护工人的温饱生活和基本权利，不能不成为美国共产党和职工运动进步分子的重要任务。
    没有疑问，摆在美国进步力量面前的任务。还是复杂和困难的。可是这些困难只能是暂时的，因为人民趋向民主、和平、进步的潮流，是任何恶势力都阻挡不住的。工人阶级和人民群众从本国的和外国的每天的事变中，不能不逐步认识到反动势力必须击破和可能击破的真理，不能不逐步认识到资本主义制度的腐败和社会主义制度的光明。在美国现时的条件下，这种认识的过程虽然常常是缓慢的、曲折的和潜伏的，但是新的历史的事变，却能够使这个过程十倍地加速。有了广大人民对新政与和平的普遍要求，有了美国共产党、进步党和一切进步组织作为人民民主和平斗争的骨干，有了全世界人民民主运动的高涨，和国际反动势力首先是美国反动势力所面对着的、不可逃脱的危机，美国独占资本的反动统治终会有被推翻的一天。
