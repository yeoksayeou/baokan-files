A steel torrent is sweeping towards Beiping-Tianjin. The vast masses of central Hebei are now urgently mobilizing to actively support the victorious advance of the Northeast and North China Liberation Armies in liberating Beiping-Tianjin. As a reporter traveling to the front, I witnessed a steady stream of manpower and resources flowing to the Beiping-Tianjin front, with men, women, old, and young all undertaking tasks within their capabilities. On the 15th, I passed through Hejian at night, and the entire city was shrouded in a tense atmosphere of supporting the front. The streets were crowded with welcoming people. The male owner of a teahouse on the west side of North Street, who was also a self-defense captain, was leading a stretcher team to assemble. The female owner, a group leader, was also holding a meeting with women to discuss supporting the front. Under a faint light, I saw a young woman of eighteen or nineteen anxiously saying, "Look at how the men are all going to the front lines. We can't lag behind either. This time, we need to do a better and more exemplary job of milling rice, grinding flour, and comforting the wounded." In villages such as Tiangong and Huaijialou in Hejian County, the masses milled rice and ground flour at night under the lights. The road to the front, which was uneven and dusty just a few days ago, has been repaired by the masses and has become flat and clean, leading directly to the victorious front.

From Xinzhen, the crowds heading to the front stretched endlessly, like an iron torrent sweeping north. Look! Carts one after another, with three or two sets of harnesses, mule teams, donkey teams of all kinds. They are advancing towards one direction from all directions. From all over central Hebei, the sound of the "clang, clang" of the carts and the laughter of countless liberated peasants drowned out everything. Stretcher-bearing militias in teams passed through the streets under the direct sunlight, the young men spirited and invigorated, carrying weapons and stretchers, walking proudly. Old men with wrinkled faces and gray hair also hurried forward, carrying fire shovels and buckets. They are mostly liberated peasants who have voluntarily joined the war to eliminate the Chiang-Fu bandits and liberate all of North China. Teams of people crossed the river along the grass bridge, which was built by more than a hundred bridge workers working day and night. They are still working hard to build an even larger grass bridge. The masses in the new districts of Niutuo in Ba County and Liuquan in Anci County have organized village offices and are preparing grain to transport public grain for the People's Liberation Army. They said, "Once Beiping-Tianjin is liberated, there will be peace." Along the way, one constantly encounters groups of prisoners of war, accompanied by the "radio station" constantly broadcasting victorious news: "Tongzhou has been liberated," "Fengtai has been liberated," "Nanyuan has been liberated," "...". The constant stream of victory news further encourages the people's morale. The masses in the new districts of Ba County and Gu'an County excitedly read the declarations and proclamations of the People's Liberation Army. Men, women, old, and young crowded the streets to welcome the People's Liberation Army. The walls were covered with slogans such as "Welcome the People's Liberation Army, go to Beiping-Tianjin, capture Fu Zuoyi alive."

　　钢铁的洪流卷向平津
  　冀中广大人民支援平津前线
    冀中广大人民现正紧张动员起来，积极支援东北、华北两大解放军为解放平津的胜利进军。记者赴前线中，目睹人力、物资源源涌向平津前线，男女老少都承当了力所能及的任务。十五日，记者夜过河间，全城为紧张的支前空气所笼罩，街上拥挤着欢迎的人群，北街路西茶馆的男掌柜是自卫队长，正带着担架队集合，女掌柜是小组长，妇女们也在开会研究支前。从一盏微小的灯光下看到一位十八、九岁的姑娘着急的说：“看人家男人们都上前线了，咱们也别落了后，这次碾米、磨面、慰问伤员要做的更好，更模范”。河间县天宫、槐家楼等村群众夜间点着灯碾米推面。向前线去的汽车路，前几天还是高低崎岖不平，尘土飞扬，经过群众的抢修，已变得坦平而净洁，直通向胜利的前线。
    从新镇开赴前线的人群，宽无边际，象铁流似的卷向北去。看吧！大车一辆顶一辆，三套二套的，骡马队，驴子队形形色色。他们从四面八方朝着一个方向前进。从冀中各地开往前方，“钢钢当”的大军声，和无数翻身农民的欢笑声，淹没了一切。担架民兵一队队的，从阳光直射的大街上通过，年轻的小伙子们精神振奋，带着武器，背着担架，昂然的走着。满脸皱纹花白头发的老汉们，也背着火铲，担着水桶急速前进，他们大都是翻身农民，为了消灭蒋傅匪，解放全华北，自动参战。一队队的人群沿着草桥过河，这是百余个桥工昼夜加工架起的，为架更大的草桥，他们仍在紧张的劳作着。霸县牛驼，安次柳泉等新区的群众，自己组织起村公所，筹备粮食，为解放军运送公粮。他们说：“平津一解放就平安了”。沿途不断的遇到一群群的俘虏，伴凑着“广播台”不时的传出胜利消息：“通州解放了”、“丰台解放了”、“南苑解放了”，“……”。胜利消息不断传来，更鼓舞了人民情绪。霸县、固安新区群众，兴奋的阅读着人民解放军的宣言、布告。男女老幼拥满街头，欢迎解放军。墙上满写了“欢迎人民解放军，打到平津去，活捉傅作义”的标语。　　　　　　　（冀中二十二日电）
