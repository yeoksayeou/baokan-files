　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 5th. TASS dispatch: The leadership organs of the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League, on the eve of the League's 11th National Congress, issued a report on the League's activities and the election situation. The Pravda published an editorial on this matter on November 30, stating: It must be remembered that in just September and October alone, nearly 500,000 young men and women joined the League. Young people are at the forefront of the great battle of millions striving to complete Stalin's post-war Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. Tens of thousands of League members have already completed their five-year production plans. Rural League members are participating in the movement to strive for bumper harvests every year with the youthful enthusiasm they are endowed with. In reporting its work achievements and electing new organs at all levels, the Communist Youth League is reviewing its strength as a mass political organization. The Bolshevik Party has entrusted this organization with the task of educating the younger generation in the communist spirit. In order to do a good job of this glorious task entrusted to it by the Party in the future, it is necessary to organize the overall work of the Youth League to adapt it to the diverse and increasing demands of the youth, and to make the activities of the Youth League organization permeate with far-reaching ideas.

　　联共付托青年团的任务：以共产主义精神教育年青的一代
    【新华社陕北五日电】塔斯社讯：苏联共产主义青年团领导机关在团的第十一届代表大会即将召开之际发表了关于团的活动和选举情况的报告。真理报于十一月三十日就此事发表社论称：必须记住，仅仅在九、十两个月内，就几乎有五十万男女青年入团。青年们正走在千百万争取提前完成斯大林战后五年计划的大战的最前列。数万青年团员已完成了他们五年的生产计划。农村的团员正以青年天赋的满腔热忱，参加争取年年丰收的运动。共产主义青年团在报告其工作成果以及选举新的各级机关时，检阅了它作为群众性政治组织的力量。布尔什维克党已经把以共产主义精神教育年青一代的任务付托给这一团体。为了在将来也把党付托的这一光荣任务作好，就必须组织青年团的全盘工作，使之适应青年们多方面的、日益增涨的要求，并使青年团组织的活动贯彻着深远的思想。
