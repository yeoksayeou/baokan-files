Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, December 2nd: The dying Kuomintang bandit gang is engaged in a series of treacherous negotiations with U.S. imperialism, selling out large amounts of national sovereignty in order to obtain military protection from their American masters. According to a United Press Shanghai dispatch on November 29th: In diplomatic activities in Nanjing and Shanghai, the United States has made three demands on Chiang Kai-shek as a guarantee before it considers further military assistance. (1) The Chiang Kai-shek government must guarantee to Washington that it will support and follow the United States' foreign policy, especially the United States' policy towards the Soviet Union and the new democratic countries. (2) The Chiang Kai-shek government and its battlefield officers must sincerely follow the military, technical, and strategic "opinions" and "suggestions" given by the United States to reorganize the military. (3) The Chiang Kai-shek government will open the Yangtze River ports, and American merchant ships and warships will have "full and legitimate" navigation rights. This blatant aggressive demand of U.S. imperialism has long become an open secret in the Kuomintang government's recent period of intense treacherous activities towards the United States. U.S. Secretary of Defense Forrestal said as early as November 17th at a press conference in Washington about "the possibility of sending American warships to the Yangtze River in China." The American aggressors are so blatant because the Kuomintang bandit gang has automatically offered this price in exchange for U.S. aid. It is reported that when Chiang Kai-shek wrote to Truman in mid-November, he invited "American warships to enter Chinese ports" (Washington AFP dispatch on November 17th) and welcomed the United States to send MacArthur to command his army (Washington AP dispatch on November 24th). On November 27th, Sun Ke repeated Chiang Kai-shek's wishes in a conversation with a United Press reporter in Shanghai, advocating opening up inland rivers, "allowing the U.S. Navy to use inland rivers in the way that U.S. military advisors might wish," and hoping that the United States would send a "supreme military advisor in charge of the anti-communist war" like MacArthur to China. Chiang Kai-shek is determined to sell out all the national interests he can sell out before his demise. His other treacherous activities in recent times include: First, dividing Shanghai into a so-called "international co-managed zone" to be fully taken over by the United States and other foreign forces, and requesting U.S. troops to be stationed in Shanghai. An AFP Shanghai dispatch on November 6th stated: "An agreement has been reached in Shanghai" between Chiang and the United States regarding this treacherous deal. Badger, commander of the U.S. Western Pacific Naval Forces, has stated that the U.S. Navy may send Marines to Shanghai. Second, expanding the land jurisdiction of the U.S. base in Qingdao and handing over the Qingdao municipal administration to the U.S. military. This step is being implemented. According to an AP Qingdao dispatch: The U.S. Department of Defense announced that more than 1,200 Marines being sent to Qingdao under the name of "protecting the evacuation of overseas Chinese" had arrived in Qingdao from Guam on November 29th and are "waiting to receive regular barracks." Third, placing all of Taiwan's territory under U.S. "trusteeship." According to an AFP Washington dispatch on November 18th: Chiang Kai-shek has already had Soong Mei-ling propose this treacherous condition to the United States. Fourth, expanding the U.S.'s right to use Kuomintang air force bases (AFP Washington dispatch on November 18th), etc.

Chiang Kai-shek and the entire Kuomintang government hope that the result of selling out this large amount of Chinese sovereignty will be to obtain another ten billion U.S. dollars in aid from the U.S. government. Chiang Kai-shek's letter and Kuomintang Ambassador to the United States Gu Weijun's talks in Washington on November 13th both begged the U.S. government to grant this sum. Soong Mei-ling requested the U.S. government in a broadcast to the United States on November 21st, saying: "Any future assistance must be implemented immediately."

The recent frequent treacherous negotiations between the Kuomintang government and the U.S. government are being conducted in China, Japan, and the United States. The activities that have been published by telegraph are as follows: Kuomintang Shanghai Mayor Wu Guozhen held consultations with Badger, Stuart, and the director of the U.S. Economic Cooperation Administration's China branch, Lapham. War-monger Bullitt came to China for the third time in the name of a representative of the Joint Economic Cooperation Committee of the U.S. Congress. U.S. Undersecretary of the Air Force Barrows and U.S. Republican Senator Morrow flew to Shanghai together on the 20th. Morrow completed his mission and left China on November 27th. Badawi, the head of the U.S. Military Joint Advisory Group in Nanjing, flew to Tokyo on November 20th to "discuss the Chinese situation" with MacArthur. After two days of discussions, he flew back to Nanjing. Barrows and Morrow also consulted with MacArthur in Tokyo before coming to China. Gu Weijun admitted in a conversation that "China and the United States are conducting discussions on principles in Washington." In order to accelerate the completion of the treacherous negotiations, regardless of the U.S. official's deliberate "coldness," Chiang Kai-shek dispatched his wife, Soong Mei-ling, to the United States on November 28th.

　　蒋匪加紧卖国勾当  乞求美帝军事保护
    这决救不了蒋介石的灭亡
    【新华社陕北二日电】垂死的国民党匪帮正与美帝国主义间进行一连串的卖国谈判，出卖大批国家主权，以求得美国主人的军事保护。据上月二十九日合众社上海电透露：在南京与上海的外交活动中，美国已向蒋介石提出三项要求，作为它考虑进一步军事援助前的保证。（一）蒋介石政府必须向华盛顿保证支持与追随美国的外交政策，特别是美国的对苏对新民主国家的政策。（二）蒋介石政府与他的战地军官必须诚挚地遵照美国所给的军事技术上与战略上的“意见”与“建议”，以改组军事。（三）蒋介石政府开放长江口岸，美国商船与军舰有“充分合法的”航行权利。美国帝国主义这一露骨的侵略要求，在最近一个时期国民党政府对美国的紧张的卖国活动中，早已成为公开秘密。美国国防部长福莱斯特尔，早在上月十七日，就在华盛顿记者招待会中说到“派遣美国军舰至中国长江的可能性”。美国侵略者所以如此明目张胆，是因为国民党匪帮已经自动提出这个换取美援的代价。据悉：蒋介石于上月中旬致函杜鲁门时，邀请“美国军舰开入中国港口”（十一月十七日华盛顿法新社电），并欢迎美国派遣麦克阿瑟来指挥他的军队（十一月二十四日华盛顿美联社电）。上月二十七日孙科在上海对合众社记者的谈话中，重复蒋介石的意愿，主张开放内河，“允许美国海军按美军顾问们所可能希望的方式利用内河”，并希望美国派遣一个“主持反共战争的最高军事顾问”如麦克阿瑟者来到中国。蒋介石决心在他灭亡以前，把他所能出卖的国家利益都卖出去，他在最近时期的其他卖国活动，还包括：第一，把上海划为由美国及其他外国势力全面接管的所谓“国际共管区”，要求美军进驻上海。上月六日法新社上海消息称：蒋美两方关于此项卖国交易的“协议已在上海达成”。美西太平洋海军司令白吉尔已表示美国海军可能派遣海军陆战队进入上海。第二，扩大美国在青岛基地的陆上统辖区域，并将青岛市政交由美军接管。此项步骤正在实行中。据美联社青岛消息：美国防部以“保护撤侨”为名宣布增派青岛之一千二百余名海军陆战队已于上月二十九日由关岛开抵青岛，正在“等候接收正规营房”。第三，将台湾全部领土置于美国“托管”之下。据法新社华盛顿上月十八日消息透露：蒋介石已经宋美龄将此项卖国条件向美国提出。第四，扩大美国对国民党空军基地的使用权利（法新社华盛顿上月十八日电）等。
    蒋介石和整个国民党政府希望出卖这一大批中国主权的结果，能再换得美国政府十亿美元的援助。蒋介石的信里和国民党驻美大使顾维钧上月十三日在华盛顿的谈话，都乞求美国政府赐予这一笔款子。宋美龄在十一月二十一日对美广播中要求美国政府说：“未来的任何援助，必须立刻付诸实现。”
    国民党政府与美国政府间最近的频繁的卖国谈判，是在中、日、美各地进行的。电讯所发表的活动情况如下：国民党上海市长吴国桢与白吉尔、司徒雷登及美经合总署中国分署署长莱普汉先后举行会商。战争贩子布立特以美国会经济合作联合委员会代表名义第三次来华。美空军部次长巴洛士、美共和党参议员马罗于二十日相偕飞抵上海，马罗任务完毕，已于上月二十七日离华。南京美国军事联合顾问团团长巴大维于上月二十日飞麦东京，与赴克阿瑟“会商中国局势”，经两日商谈后飞返南京。巴洛士、马罗来华，亦皆先经东京与麦克阿瑟会商。顾维钧在谈话中承认“中美双方正在华盛顿作原则上的讨论”。为了加速卖国谈判的完成，不顾美国官方的故意“冷淡”，蒋介石已派遣其妻宋美龄于上月二十八日动身前往美国。
