Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, December 28th: TASS, Moscow, December 24th: A diplomatic observer for the News Reports, commenting on the dangerous consequences caused by the United Nations Indonesian "Mediation Committee" in Indonesia, stated: "The 'Mediation Committee' is not only used as a smokescreen to thoroughly prepare for a military offensive against Indonesia, but also as a cover for destructive activities against the Indonesian people's national liberation movement. It is hard to believe that the committee was allegedly unaware that the Dutch military headquarters was preparing a new provocation. Undoubtedly, the preparation for the unreasonable attack on the Republic's territory has been going on for a long time. This can be proved by the use of a large number of the latest aircraft and non-Dutch-made tanks by the Dutch army units participating in the offensive. The Dutch troops attacking Yogyakarta used American-made "B-25" bombers and British-made "Mitchell" medium bombers, as well as "Stuart" and "Sherman" tanks. These facts, as well as other facts, show that it is not only the Dutch colonial bosses who are attacking the Republic of Indonesia, but also the active intervention of the United States in Indonesia's internal affairs under the guise of the "Mediation" Committee."

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, December 29th: Various reports: The United States continues to provide material assistance to the Netherlands in massacring the Indonesian people. On the same day that the Security Council met to discuss the Indonesian issue (December 22nd), the U.S. "Foreign Aid" executive agency, the Economic Cooperation Administration, announced the approval of another 545 million US dollars for aid to the Netherlands. According to a Telecommunications Agency report on the 23rd: "The US Embassy in the Netherlands has confirmed the Dutch Foreign Minister's statement that the purchase of essential materials needed for military aggression against Indonesia under the Marshall Plan can proceed without difficulty." On the same day, the Dutch Communist newspaper "De Waarheid" published a "witness account" from its correspondent in Java, confirming that American military aid to the Netherlands is being used to indiscriminately kill Indonesian people. The "witness account" stated: "Many civilians were shot and killed on the streets of Yogyakarta. At the same time, many houses have been burned down due to the Dutch bombing. When the latest American heavy bombers bombed the city of Madiun this morning, machine guns on the planes shot and killed many civilians."

　　美帝利用“调处”烟幕
  　助荷屠杀印尼人民
  　苏消息报猛烈予以抨击
    【新华社陕北二十八日电】塔斯社莫斯科二十四日讯：消息报外交观察家在评论联合国印尼“调处委员会”在印尼所造成的危险后果称：“调处委员会”不只是用作彻底准备军事进攻印尼的烟幕，并且也可以当作一种掩敝反对印尼人民民族解放运动的破坏活动的烟幕。关于该委员会所谓不知道荷军司令部准备新挑衅一说，是很难令人相信的。无疑地，无理进攻共和国领土的准备是已进行很久了。这由参加攻势的荷陆军部队之使用大量最新式的飞机及非荷兰造的坦克，可以得到证明。进攻日惹的荷军所使用的是美国制的“Ｂ二五”式轰炸机与英国制的“米契尔”式中型轰炸机，及“司徒”式与“薛尔曼”式坦克。这些事实以及其他的事实显示：不仅仅有荷兰殖民头子对印尼共和国的进攻，而且还有美国在“调处”委员会招牌下对印尼内政的积极干涉。
    【新华社陕北二十九日电】各方报导：美国正继续以物资援助荷兰屠杀尼印人民。与安理会开会讨论印尼问题同日（二十二日），美国“援”外执行机关经合总署又宣布批准一笔五十四万五千亿美元的款项作为援荷之用。据电通社二十三日消息称：“美驻荷大使馆已证实荷外长声明，即按马歇尔计划购买军事侵略印尼所需的重要物资可以毫无困难的进行。”同日荷共报纸“德·瓦尔海报”发表该报驻爪哇记者的“目击录”，证实美国对荷兰的军事援助正被用来滥杀印尼人民。该“目击录”称：“许许多多的市民，被击毙在日惹街上，同时，许多房屋已因荷方的滥炸而燃烧。美国最新式的重轰炸机于今晨轰炸茉莉芬城时，飞机上的机枪曾射死许多市民。”
