　　The Plight of the Education Sector in Beiping and Tianjin
  　Meager Salaries Unable to Provide Sustenance

    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 10th] According to reports from Beiping and Tianjin newspapers in early November, the employees of the education sector in Beiping and Tianjin were suffering greatly. The highest monthly salary for a university professor in Beiping was 125 yuan in puppet Gold Yuan notes, plus a research fee of 20 yuan, totaling no more than 145 yuan. According to the market price of flour in Beiping at the end of October, a professor's total income was only enough to buy about 60 jin (30 kg) of flour, which was not enough to maintain even the most basic living standards for a family of three. Zhang Tianlin, the director of the Department of Education at Peking University, who suffered from osteomyelitis, could only afford to eat millet porridge and corn buns at home. Fan Hong, a professor of economics, and Xiang Da, a professor of history, both had to borrow money from the university every week to make ends meet. The son of a senior staff member at the university could not afford to go to school and was sent to work as a handyman at the university. A teacher in the Physical Education Department of the Hebei Women's Normal School in Tianjin received only 1 jiao and 8 fen in puppet Gold Yuan notes in October after deducting food and coal expenses. The salaries of teachers and staff in Beiping municipal primary schools were only 68 yuan per month, in addition to a bag of flour that was not distributed regularly, which was not enough to buy a bag of flour or half a ton of coal. The lives of school workers and guards were even more miserable. A handyman at Peking University earned only 20 yuan per month, and they could only afford to eat one corn bun and a bowl of boiled water per meal. Zhou Zuoren, a professor of economics at Peking University, said in an article entitled "Feelings on the Suspension of Teaching at Peking University" that in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, "the problem currently faced by teachers and staff in universities, middle schools, and primary schools is not bad clothing and bad food, but no clothing and no food." This situation led to the outbreak of the anti-hunger movement in the education sector in Beiping and Tianjin in October and November.

　　平津教育界生活痛苦
  　薪资微薄不得温饱
    【新华社陕北十日电】据十一月初平津报刊披露当时平、津教育界员工生活痛苦情形称：平市大学教授最高月薪为伪金圆券一百二十五元，外加研究费二十元，合计不过一百四十五元。按十月底北平面粉市价，教授的全部收入仅够买约六十斤面粉，即三口之家，亦无法维持最起码的生活。患骨髓炎的北京大学教育系主任张天麟家里吃小米粥、窝窝头。经济系教授樊弘、历史系教授向达，每星期都得向校方借钱维持生活。该校某高级职员儿子念不起书，被送去当校工。天津河北女师体育系某教员，十月份月薪除扣除膳费、煤费外，仅得伪金圆券一角八分。北平市立小学教职员待遇，除一袋并非定期发放的面粉外，月入仅六十八元，买不到一袋面粉或半吨煤。学校工警生活更为凄惨，北大校工月入仅二十元，他们每顿仅能吃到一个窝头和一碗开水。北大经济系教授周作仁在“有感于北大停教”一文中说，国民党统治区“目前大中小学教职员所遇到的问题，不是恶衣恶食，而是无衣无食”。这种情形促成了十月、十一月间平、津教育界反饥饿运动的爆发。
