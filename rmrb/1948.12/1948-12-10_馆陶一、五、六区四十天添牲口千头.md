　　Guantao First, Fifth, and Sixth Districts Add a Thousand Head of Livestock in Forty Days
    In the forty-day production campaign in the first, fifth, and sixth districts of Guantao, Hebei-Henan-Anhui Border Region, the masses actively increased their purchase of livestock. The sixth district added 575 head of livestock, the fifth district 220 head, and the first district 271 head. This is a great force for planting wheat and completing autumn plowing this year. The reasons why the masses increased their purchase of livestock: First, reasonable solutions to conscription issues, prohibiting random conscription and substitute plowing; wartime conscription, animal conscription can substitute for human conscription (in the past, it could not substitute for human conscription). If both people and animals are conscripted, the masses can discuss and reasonably decide how much conscription it can offset. Second, for military families without labor who meet the conditions for substitute plowing, fixed substitute plowing households are established through the masses. Fixed households specialize in substitute plowing for military families, and they can be exempted from their corvée labor. This is suitable for village cadres, military families, and substitute plowing households. Third, rewards for breeding, mother cows are exempt from corvée labor for a certain period before and after giving birth, and are exempt from long-term corvée labor for half a year after giving birth. Fourth, in the past, the fifth district generally exempted donkeys from corvée labor. For example, there are many small donkeys in Dongxu Village (because donkeys are not required to do corvée labor, so they all feed small donkeys). This time, it was determined that donkeys would also do corvée labor, and many households have replaced them with cattle. Fifth, newly livestock-raising households (who have never raised livestock before) are exempt from corvée labor for three months. Furthermore, the benefits of raising livestock are widely publicized when adding livestock, using the harvest of livestock-raising households compared with the harvest of non-livestock-raising households, specifically calculating accounts, clarifying thoughts, and calling on the masses to buy livestock and jointly purchase livestock in large quantities.

　　馆陶一、五、六区四十天添牲口千头
    冀南馆陶一、五、六区在四十天的生产运动中，群众积极增买牲口。计六区增添牲口五百七十五头，五区二百二十头，一区二百七十一头，对今年种麦及完成秋耕都是一支很大的力量。群众增买牲畜的原因：一、合理解决支差问题，禁止乱支差、代耕；战勤支差，牛差顶人差（过去不顶人差）、如人牛都出差，可由群众讨论合理顶多少差。二、军属无劳力合乎代耕条件的，通过群众固定代耕户，固定户专为军属代耕，可以免除他的差役，这样村干、军属、代耕户都感合适。三、奖励繁殖，母牛产前产后一定时期不出差，产后半年不出长差。四、过去五区普遍是驴不出差，如东徐村小驴很多（因不叫驴出差，所以都喂小驴），这次确定驴也出差，有不少户都换了牛。五、新喂牛户（过去从未喂过牛）三个月不出差。再是在增添牲口时普遍宣传喂牛的益处，用喂牛户的收获量与不喂牛户的收获量作对比，具体算帐，打通思想，号召群众大量买牛和伙买牲口。
