Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 10th—Reports from various sources: The strike by American West Coast dockworkers and sailors, which lasted for 95 days, ended victoriously on the 5th. Striking workers began returning to work on the 6th. After the ILWU (International Longshore and Warehouse Union) voted to approve the new contract on November 29th, the independent Marine Firemen, Oilers, Watertenders and Wipers Association, the Marine Cooks and Stewards Union (CIO), and the Commercial Telegraphers' Union (CIO) successively reached agreements with the employers, announcing the formal end of the strike on the 3rd and removing the picket lines. Subsequently, the resumption of work was delayed by two days due to the Seafarers International Union (AFL) raising the issue of union jurisdiction. This four-coast strike was the second longest strike since the 98-day strike on the US West Coast in 1936. The shipping companies initially intended to use delaying tactics to exhaust the ILWU, led by the progressive labor leader Harry Bridges, but ultimately they were defeated by the workers' heroic persistence in the struggle. According to the Associated Press, during the strike, 280 ships were idled in American ports due to the West Coast strike.
    
Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 3rd—Reports from various sources: The strike by American East Coast dockworkers, which lasted 18 days, was declared victoriously concluded on November 27th. Labor and management completed the agreement to sign a new contract on the 25th, and striking workers voted to approve it on the 27th. The new contract stipulates a wage increase of 13 cents per hour, retroactive to the expiration of the last contract on August 21st, and provides for improvements in the workers' holiday system and the establishment of a welfare fund. Meanwhile, West Coast dockworkers, who began striking on September 2nd, also signed a new contract with the shipping companies on the 25th. This contract was approved by the workers' vote on the 27th and approved by the ILWU committee on the 29th. The new contract is valid for three years, stipulating a future wage increase of 15 cents per hour, and the union continues to retain the right to manage the hiring hall, with workers being assigned work by the union and employers having no right to interfere. Since the other three unions on the West Coast—the Marine Cooks and Stewards Union (CIO), the Commercial Telegraphers' Union (CIO), and the independent Marine Firemen, Oilers, Watertenders and Wipers Association—have not yet signed contracts with the employers, the entire West Coast strike, including the dockworkers, was still continuing as of November 30th.

    美国东西两海岸
    码头罢工胜利
    【新华社陕北十日电】各方报导：坚持达九十五天的美国西海岸码头工人与海员罢工，已于五日胜利结束。罢工工人已于六日起开始复工。自十一月廿九日产联码头仓库工人工会投票通过新合同后，独立的轮船升火工人工会、产联轮船厨师、侍者工会与产联报务员工会，先后与资方获致协议，当于三日宣布罢工正式结束，并撤销纠察线。其后，由于劳联太平洋海员工会借端提出工会管辖权问题，遂使复工延迟两天。这次四海岸罢工是一九三六年美国西海岸九十八天罢工以来第二次最长的罢工，航业公司最初原拟以拖延战术拖垮进步工人领袖布利治领导的码头仓库工人工会，但终因工人们英勇地坚持斗争而获得胜利。据美联社称，罢工期间美国各港口因西岸罢工而停驶的船只，计达二百八十艘。
    【新华社陕北三日电】各方报导：坚持十八天的美国东海岸码头工人罢工，已于十一月二十七日宣告胜利结束。劳资双方系于二十五日完成订立新合同的协议，二十七日由罢工工人投票通过。新合同规定自上次合同满期之八月二十一日起，每小时增加工资一角三分，并规定改善工人假日制度，设置福利基金。同时，自九月二日开始罢工的西海岸码头工人，亦已于二十五日与航业公司签订新合同，该合同于二十七日由工人投票通过，并于二十九日由码头仓库工人工会委员会批准。新合同有效期为三年，规定今后每小时增加工资一角五分，工会继续保有管理待雇室之权，工人由工会分配工作，雇主无权过问。由于西海岸其他三个工会，即产联海员厨师工会、产联无线电报报务员工会与独立的海员升火工人工会尚未与雇主签订合同，因此，包括码头工人在内的整个西海岸罢工，迄十一月三十日止仍在继续中。
