　　Taihang Establishes General Study Committee
  　Sets Out Half-Year Study Plan
    [Taihang Electric] In order to implement the North China Bureau's decision on the study of cadres in service, the General Study Committee of the directly subordinate organs of the District Party Committee, Military Region, and Administrative Office here was officially established on the 13th of this month and held its first meeting, specifically discussing and formulating the study plan for cadres of directly subordinate organs for the first half of next year. (1) Organization and leadership of study: The units directly under the District Party Committee are divided into five study districts according to region, and each study district organizes a study branch to unify and concentrate leadership. The study branch is composed of the heads of each unit in the district. The comrades participating in the General Study Committee are the main persons in charge of the branch. As for the units themselves, they can also organize the unit's study committee in conjunction with the organ branch. (2) Study groups: According to the standards set by the North China Bureau, all cadres are divided into three groups, A, B, and C, according to their theoretical and cultural level. Those participating in Group A are cadres equivalent to the District Party Committee level and the Prefectural Committee level, and some county-level cadres who are suitable for Group A conditions; those participating in Group B are county-level cadres and individual Prefectural Committee-level cadres and District-level cadres who are suitable for Group B conditions; those participating in Group C are general District-level cadres and some county-level cadres who are suitable for Group C conditions. (3) Study content and steps: In the first half of 1949, we will first study general basic theoretical knowledge of social science, and in the second half, we will study Chairman Mao's basic theoretical works. The specific plan is: Group A will study "The History of Social Development," "Political Economy," and "Dialectical Materialism and Historical Materialism" in the first half of the year; in the second half of the year, they will study "Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin on China," "Outline of Leninism," "The Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party," and "On New Democracy," and if there is time, they can also study "Two Tactics" and "Left-Wing Communism: An Infantile Disorder." Group B will also start with "The History of Social Development" in the first half of the year, and then make specific regulations; in the second half of the year, they will study "The Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party," etc. Group C will implement the study of culture and general political common sense throughout the year. Party member cadres will also study the branch teaching materials compiled and printed by the Propaganda Department of the District Party Committee on Party Day. (4) Study methods: According to the decision of the North China Bureau, Group A will focus on personal in-depth study; Group B will focus on self-study and discussion, combined with lectures and reports in a certain period; both Group A and Group B must take serious study notes and frequently write articles for Party newspapers and Party journals. Group C can jointly organize spare-time cultural supplementary schools for cadres by neighboring organs, and teachers will be designated or hired by each study branch. (5) Study system: A. Meeting system: The General Study Committee will meet once a month, and temporary meetings should be convened when necessary to specifically study and answer various theoretical questions raised in the study. Each study branch will meet once every ten days or half a month; the main responsibility of each study committee is to strengthen ideological leadership in the study. B. Reporting system: Each branch will submit a written report once a month, which will be sent to the General Study Committee before the 25th of each month. C. Examination and test system: The Propaganda Department of the District Party Committee will uniformly issue cadre study achievement assessment and registration forms and conduct regular tests. An assessment must be conducted every six months. D. Reward and criticism system: Each study branch should formulate certain reward and criticism methods based on the situation in its study district. Those with particularly excellent results will be given appropriate rewards and commendations by the General Study Committee; those who are particularly bad will also be given oral or written criticism by the General Study Committee. In addition, the Taihang Xinhua Daily is preparing to publish a study supplement regularly. Preparatory work such as study mobilization and grouping is currently underway.
