　　【Taihang Telegram】The Jixian City Democratic Government in northern Henan is planning to restore Wei River shipping between Xinxiang and Tianjin. The Wei River originates from Baiquan on Sument Mountain in Huixian, passes south through Xinxiang, circles north of Jixian City to the east, and meets the Hongshui River to the Grand Canal, directly reaching Tianjin, a distance of approximately 2,200 li. Before the war, there were more than 2,000 boats capable of carrying 100 tons (equivalent to over 200,000 jin), employing more than 50,000 boatmen. The bloody devastation of the Japanese invaders during the eight years of conscription, extortion, and murder reduced the number of boats by more than half. Coupled with the Kuomintang reactionary rule's destruction of the shipping industry in recent years, now, except for a hundred or so large boats still operating between Daokou in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan region and Linqing in the southern Hebei region, there is not even one large boat between Xinxiang and Jixian. In order to plunder and seize civilian shipping, the Kuomintang reactionary government readily accused boatmen of "colluding with bandits." The boat of Li Fukui, a boatman from Daokou, was detained in Xinxiang for four years, forcing most of the boatmen into unemployment, with some pulling rickshaws and others fishing. Now, those in Xinxiang are fleeing to the liberated areas. The Jixian City Democratic Government is planning to organize them for production and help solve their current living and production difficulties, so that after Xinxiang is liberated in the near future, Wei River shipping can be quickly restored.

　　汲县民主政府资助失业船夫
  　准备恢复卫河航运
    【太行电】豫北汲县市民主政府，正计划恢复新乡至天津间的卫河船运。卫河发源于辉县苏门山之百泉，南经新乡，东绕汲县市北，会洪水至运河直达天津，长约二千二百余里。战前能载百吨（合二十余万斤）的船有两千余只，船夫有五万余。日寇八年来的抓兵勒索杀害等血腥摧残，使船只减少一半以上，加以近年来国民党反动统治对船业的摧毁，现在除冀鲁豫道口至冀南区临清段尚有百余只大船外，新乡至汲县间连一只大船也没有。国民党反动政府为了掠索和抢夺民间船业，动辄嫁以“通匪”罪名。道口的船夫李福魁的船即被扣在新乡停动四年，逼的绝大部分船夫失业，有的拉洋车，有的打鱼。现在新乡者都纷纷逃来解放区。汲县市民主政府正计划组织他们生产，并帮助解决其当前生活与生产的困难，以便不久将来新乡解放后，迅速恢复卫河航运。
