　　A Spinning Wheel Hums,
  　Earning Grain for the Front Lines
    Guo, the wife of Li Fengyi, from Nanxintou Village, Guantao, Jinnan, is from a poor peasant background. She is very active in weaving and selling cloth. During the autumn harvest, she helps with the harvest in the fields during the day, and spins cotton at night. In one autumn, she used two sets of capital for selling cloth, exchanging them for twenty-four jin of cotton batting, enough to solve the cotton clothing needs of a family of five. Li Fengyi heard from the village cadres at a meeting that, "This year, the public grain is thirty jin per mu. If you can weave cloth, thirty chi of cloth counts as one bolt, equivalent to 87 jin and 12 liang of public grain!" He told his wife when he got home. Guo said, "It's not very cold yet. Let's weave the cotton batting we prepared for winter clothes into six bolts of cloth. Let's calculate how much rice that would be worth? How many days will it take to weave six bolts of cloth?" Fengyi said, "That's great, I'm just afraid you won't want to!" Guo said, "For the country and for ourselves, how could I not want to? Let's calculate it!" Fengyi said, "We are responsible for twenty-three mu of land, and should pay more than five hundred jin of public grain (excluding wheat, which is seven jin per mu). Weaving six bolts of cloth should also be worth more than five hundred jin of rice." Guo said, "Then I will work hard! I can weave one bolt of cloth in seven days, so it will only take me more than forty days to complete it. Will public grain still be a problem then?"

　　一辆纺车嗡嗡转
  　赚出公粮送前线
    冀南馆陶南辛头村，李凤仪的妻郭氏，贫农成份，织卖布很积极，在秋收时候，白天下地帮助秋收，夜间还纺棉花，一秋天两个卖布的本，换了二十四斤花絮，能解决一家五口人的棉衣问题。李凤仪听村干开会说：“今年公粮每亩三十斤，要有能织布的，织三十尺的布算一匹，当公粮八十七斤十二两！”回家告诉了老婆，郭氏说：“这时候天还不大冷，咱把准备棉衣的花絮织成六匹布，算一算能顶多少米？织六匹布能用几天的工夫？”凤仪说：“那很好，就怕你不愿意！”郭氏说：“为国家为自己，怎么不愿意，咱算算吧！”凤仪说：“咱负担地二十三亩，应纳公粮（除麦每亩七斤）五百多斤，织六匹布也能顶五百多斤米。”郭氏说：“那么我努努力吧！七天就能织出一匹布，不过四十几天工夫就完成了，公粮还成问题吗？”
