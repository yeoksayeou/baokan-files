Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 26th—Northeast China is taking advantage of the winter slack season to vigorously organize peasants to engage in logging, fur and other sideline production. Heilongjiang Province has decided to harvest 600,000 cubic meters of logs this winter. The Provincial Forestry Bureau, under the principles of considering both public and private interests and mutual benefit on a voluntary basis, mobilized over 10,000 laborers and 7,000 animals, organized into large teams by county, medium teams by district, and small teams by village, to enter the mountains for logging. It is stipulated that each person receives seventeen catties of sorghum per day, and each horse receives twenty-four catties of sorghum per day. The peasants are enthusiastically participating. Huanan County has organized more than 600 people and 700 horses to prepare to go up the mountain. The Tangyuan County team first sent 170 cadres, technicians, and doctors to the mountains to make preparations. At the same time, over 1,200 people from seven counties including Tangyuan, Yilan, and Jining who are participating in hunting have also set off one after another. Tangyuan County alone organized over 600 workers with hunting skills, using "Dui Tangzi" (traps set by hunters to catch wild animals) to capture otter and gray hides, etc. The trade bureaus and cooperatives in various places have also provided loans to solve most of the difficulties faced by hunters in terms of production tools and materials. The Tangyuan County Trade Bureau has provided loans of various materials and cash totaling 410,025,000 yuan. The Yilan County Trade Bureau has also provided loans of various materials and cash worth approximately 70 million yuan. Other counties have also issued fur production loans to solve the difficulties of the peasants. Heilongjiang, Songjiang, and Jilin provinces are also organizing winter hunting in addition to logging. After completing the task of producing 50,000 railway sleepers by the end of September, Wangqing County, Jilin Province, plans to produce another 420,000 railway sleepers and 5,000 various animal skins. To successfully complete the above plan, the county's cooperatives and trade bureaus have prepared various tools for sale to the peasants. At present, peasants in various districts have gone up the mountains to build roads and houses for residence during winter logging and hunting. The county has built about 30 houses that can accommodate 30 to 60 people each.

　　北满各地利用冬闲组织农民伐木打猎
    【新华社哈尔滨二十六日电】北满各地正利用冬闲，大力组织农民进行伐木、毛皮等副业生产。合江省今冬决定采伐原木六十万立方公尺，由省林务局在公私兼顾、自愿两利原则下，动员人工万余、牲畜七千，以县为单位编成大队，区为中队，村为小队入山伐木，并规定每人一天工资十七斤高粱米，马每匹每天二十四斤高粱米。农民踊跃参加。桦南县已组织了六百余人、七百匹马准备上山。汤原县大队先派干部、技师、医生一百七十余人上山筹备。与此同时，汤原、依兰、鸡宁等七县参加打猎的一千二百余人也已陆续出发，仅汤原县即组织了六百余有打猎技术的工人，用“对趟子”（猎人为捕捉野兽设置的陷阱）的方法以打获兀皮及灰皮等。各地猎人生产工具与物质困难也大部由各贸易局和合作社分别贷款解决。汤原县贸易局贷出各种物资、现款共值四亿一千万零二万五千元。依兰县贸易局亦贷出各种物资、现款约值七千多万元。其他各县也都发放了毛皮生产贷款，解决了农民的困难。黑龙江、松江、吉林各地除伐木外，亦组织冬季打猎。吉林汪清县于九月底完成了五万根铁道枕木的任务后，全县又计划做铁道枕木四十二万根，生产各种兽皮五千张。为胜利完成以上计划，该县各合作社与贸易局已准备了各种工具分售与农民。现各区农民已上山修路盖房子，为冬季入山伐木、打猎时居住之用。全县已盖好能容三十人及六十人的房子三十所左右。
