Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 1st: The Women's International Democratic Federation decided to hold its Second World Women's Congress in Budapest today. The agenda for this meeting includes: 1. Report on international women's activities; 2. The tasks of the International Democratic Women's Movement in the struggle for peace and democracy; 3. Protection of women's political and economic rights; 4. Development of women's democratic movements in Asia and Africa; 5. Situation of children. The delegation from the Chinese liberated areas attending the conference is headed by Comrade Cai Chang, Director of the Women's Federation, and includes Zhang Qinqiu, Secretary-General of the Liberated Area Women's Federation, female writer Ding Ling, and Han Youtong, member of the Northeast Administrative Committee. They brought a large number of photos and charts about the lives and struggles of women in the liberated areas, as well as products made by women in the liberated areas, for exhibition at the conference. The Liberated Area Women's Federation joined the Women's International Democratic Federation after the First World Women's Congress in 1945. Over the past three years, it has maintained regular contact with the Federation and sent Comrade Lu Cui as a resident secretary to participate in the work of the Secretariat. Since its establishment, the Democratic Women's Federation has been committed to the cause of peace and democracy, and has launched publicity campaigns to implement UN resolutions, investigated the post-war situation in Germany, reported shocking news about the illegal increase in steel production in the British and American occupied areas of Germany and the massive inflow of American dollars into the Ruhr industry and trade, investigated the situation of German women and helped them promote the democratization of Germany, launched a campaign to save three heroic Spanish women (Taular, Taumida O, and O Daro), protested against France's reactionary war in Vietnam, and protested against the economic and military support of imperialism to the Chinese and Greek reactionaries. The Democratic Women's Federation publishes journals and pamphlets reporting on the liberation struggles of women in various countries and the movement against new war conspiracies. In order to support the women's movement in Asia, the Democratic Women's Federation organized a Southeast Asia visit group and is currently preparing to convene an Asian women's conference. The international democratic women's movement led by the Democratic Women's Federation has become a huge force in the world peace and democratic movement.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 30th: TASS reported: The Soviet Labor Daily published an article on the 27th by Petrova and Alexandrova entitled "Who is Obstructing the Convening of the Asian Women's Congress?". The authors wrote: The democratic public cannot ignore the fact that the Asian Women's Congress, originally scheduled to be held in Calcutta in October 1948, was sabotaged. In its reply to the Women's International Democratic Federation, the Indian government refused to hold the meeting in Calcutta. The Indian government's reply was a deliberate blow to the democratic women's movement in Asian countries. Considering the great significance of this conference, the Secretariat of the Women's International Democratic Federation decided to convene a joint meeting of the Colonial Committee of the World Democratic Women's Federation and the Preparatory Committee of the Asian Women's Congress in Budapest. The authors concluded: The sabotage of the Calcutta conference has aroused great indignation among women around the world.

　　世界妇代大会在匈京开幕
    将讨论亚非两洲妇女民主运动蔡畅同志率解放区代表团参加
    【新华社陕北一日电】国际民主妇女联盟决定于本日在布达佩斯召开第二次世界妇女代表大会。这次会议的日程有：一、国际妇女活动的报告；二、国际民主妇女运动为和平民主而斗争的任务；三、妇女政治经济权利的保护；四、亚非两洲妇女民主运动的发展；五、儿童情况。中国解放区出席大会的代表团由妇联会主任蔡畅同志任团长，代表包括解放区妇联会秘书长张琴秋、女作家丁玲、东北行政委员会委员韩幽桐等。她们携带大批关于解放区妇女生活和斗争的照片、图表，解放区妇女的生产品，以备在大会上展览之用。解放区妇联在一九四五年世界第一次妇女代表大会后即加入了国际民主妇联，三年来与该会有经常的联系，并派陆璀同志为该会常驻秘书，参加秘书处的工作。民主妇联成立以来致力于和平民主事业，曾发动为实行联合国决议的宣传，调查德国战后情况，报导了德国英美占领区钢产非法提高与大量美金流入鲁尔工业和贸易的惊人消息，调查德国妇女情况帮助她们促进德国的民主化，进行拯救三个英勇西班牙妇女（陶拉尔、陶米达欧、欧大罗）的运动，抗议法国在越南进行的反动战争，抗议帝国主义对中国和希腊反动派的经济和军事上的支持等。民主妇联出版的会刊和小册子，报导着各国妇女的解放斗争和反对新战争阴谋的运动。为了声援亚洲的妇女运动，民主妇联曾组织东南亚访问团，现正筹开亚洲妇女会议。民主妇联所领导的国际民主妇女运动，已经成为世界和平民主运动中一支巨大的力量。
    【新华社陕北三十日电】塔斯社讯：苏联劳动报于廿七日刊载彼特罗瓦及亚历山德罗瓦两人合著题为“谁阻挠亚洲各国妇女大会之召开”的文章。作者写道：民主公众不能漠视破坏原订一九四八年十月在加尔各答举行亚洲各国妇女大会的事实。印度政府在答复国际民主妇女联盟的信件中拒绝了在加尔各答开会，印度政府的复函，是有意地打击亚洲各国的民主妇女运动的。国际民主妇女联盟秘书处考虑到这一大会的巨大意义，乃决定在布达佩斯召开世界民主妇女联盟殖民地委员会和亚洲各国妇女大会筹委会的联席会议。作者结语称：加尔各答会议之被破坏，在全世界妇女当中激起了很大的义愤。
