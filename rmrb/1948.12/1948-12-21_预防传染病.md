　　Preventing Infectious Diseases
    The prevalence of infectious diseases this year is unprecedented in recent years, with widespread epidemics and many types of diseases. The situation of patients admitted to a certain hospital can be seen as a general example.

    In the past four months, more than 400 people have been admitted with influenza, relapsing fever, malaria, dysentery, typhoid, paratyphoid, typhus, cholera, smallpox, and epidemic cerebrospinal meningitis. Now that the weather is cold, the general epidemic of diseases will pass. But this year is different. According to a survey of admissions to the hospital in October, the number exceeded the number for July, August, and September. Currently, most cases are influenza and relapsing fever.

    In order to prevent the continued development of this disease, the symptoms, prevention, and treatment methods of influenza and relapsing fever are introduced as follows:

    Symptoms: Influenza is characterized by chills and fever, with the temperature reaching a high fever of 39 to 40 degrees Celsius within one or two days, and gradually decreasing and resolving in about a week. Relapsing fever often has sudden chills and fever, with the temperature reaching above 41 degrees Celsius; generally, the fever resolves after five to seven days with profuse sweating. After a fever-free period of four to fourteen days, a second high fever occurs with chills and shivering, and the general symptoms of this fever period are milder and faster than the first. This cycle repeats, and the more frequent the attacks, the shorter and lower the fever continues, and the fever-free period gradually lengthens. Both influenza and relapsing fever have similar symptoms such as pain in the whole body, muscles, joints, and sacrum. The pulse of relapsing fever reaches 120 to 140 beats per minute; while the pulse rate of influenza is lower.

    Treatment: For relapsing fever, 606 can be injected. Recently, some people have also used 3% mercurochrome solution, injecting 10 cc intravenously each time.

    There is no specific drug for influenza, so only treat the symptoms. However, in the early stage of the disease, use a large amount of pepper or aspirin to induce sweating. Traditional Chinese medicine can use Xiao Chai Hu Tang.

    Prevention: Healthy people, especially those who are weak, should not approach patients. The items used by patients (bowls, chopsticks, bedding, etc.) should be fixed and not used interchangeably. At the same time, lice are the medium of transmission for relapsing fever and should also be noted. Patients must rest for two to four weeks after initial recovery before returning to work.

### 预防传染病

　　预防传染病
    今年传染病之流行为数年来所未有，流行广，病类也多。仅据某医院收容病人的情况可见一般。
    四个月来收到的有流感、回归热、疟疾、赤痢、伤寒、副伤寒、斑疹伤寒、霍乱、天花、流行性脑脊髓膜炎等四百余人。现在天已冷，一般疾病流行将过。但今年则不然，据该院十月份的一次收容，都超过七、八、九三个月的数目。目前所发生的多是流感和回归热。
    为防止此病继续发展，现将流感和回归热症状和预防、治疗法介绍如下：
    症状：流感以恶寒战栗而发热，在一二日内热度达三十九至四十度的高热，在一礼拜左右慢慢下降而解热。回归热则常突然发冷发热，热候可达四十一度以上；一般经五——七日后大汗淋漓而解热。后经四至十四日之无热期，则再以恶寒战栗而发第二次高热，此热期一般症状均较第一次轻快。如此反复进行发作，次数愈频，则其热之继续愈短愈低，而无热期也逐渐延长。不论流感和回归热，都有全身饥肉及关节和荐骨疼痛等相似症状。回归热脉搏每分钟达一百二十至一百四十次；而流感则脉搏数少。
    治疗：如系回归热，可注射六○六。近并有人用３％红汞液，每次静脉注射十西西。
    流感无特效药，只好对症。然于病初用胡椒或阿比等大量发汗。中药可用小柴胡汤。
    预防：好人尤其是身体衰弱之人不可接近病人，凡病人所用之物（碗、筷、被褥等）要固定，不要互用。同时虱子为回归热传染之媒介，亦应注意。病人在初愈后一定要静养二至四周方可工作。
