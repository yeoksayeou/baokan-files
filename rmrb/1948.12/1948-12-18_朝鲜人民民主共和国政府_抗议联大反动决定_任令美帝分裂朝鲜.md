　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th: TASS, Pyongyang dispatch: Pak Hon-yong, Foreign Minister of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, sent a telegram to United Nations General Assembly Secretary-General Lie on December 10th, announcing on behalf of the Korean government its non-recognition of the UN General Assembly's decision on the Korean issue. The telegram protested the UN General Assembly's Political and Security Committee's decision to disallow the delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea from participating in the UN General Assembly's discussion of the Korean issue. The telegram stated: "The government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has repeatedly requested Your Excellency to grant the representatives of the People's Democratic Republic the convenience of participating in the UN General Assembly's discussion of the Korean issue. The government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea bases its claim on the fact that, when discussing the Korean issue, the UN General Assembly should listen to the opinions of the true representatives of the Korean people and pass resolutions that conform to the interests and wishes of our people. However, the UN General Assembly Political Committee disregarded this point, completely ignoring the legitimate request of our government and the will of the entire Korean people, and passed a resolution disallowing the delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea from participating in the UN General Assembly's discussion of the Korean issue. The government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea protests this decision of the Political Committee. The Korean government deems it necessary to announce that if the UN General Assembly passes resolutions or other measures regarding the Korean issue without the participation of the Korean delegation, the Korean government and the entire Korean people will not recognize such resolutions and will continue to struggle for the complete withdrawal of foreign troops from Korea, for national unification, and for the establishment of a single, independent, and democratic state." Pak Hon-yong has also sent the same telegram to Evatt, Chairman of the Third Session of the UN General Assembly.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th: Paris dispatch: The UN General Assembly's Political and Security Committee began discussing the Korean issue on December 6th and concluded on the evening of the 8th. During the discussion, the Soviet delegation proposed abolishing the so-called "United Nations Commission on Korea," and denounced the commission for splitting Korea and approving the results of the South Korean pseudo-election on May 10th. However, the representatives of the United States, Australia, and "China" (Kuomintang), based on the report of the so-called "United Nations Commission on Korea," put forward another proposal on the 6th, requesting approval of the commission's report, recognizing the Seoul regime as the "only legitimate government of Korea," and establishing a new "Commission on Korea." The so-called "United Nations Commission on Korea" is an illegal organization established by the previous UN General Assembly under the control of the United States in violation of the UN Charter. Its purpose is to use the name of the United Nations to legalize the United States' plan to split Korea and enslave South Korea. According to the will of the United States, the commission, in its report, on the one hand, slandered the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, which truly represents the will of the entire Korean people, and on the other hand, nonsensically claimed that the May 10th South Korean "election" farce was a "democratic election," demanding recognition of the US lackey Syngman Rhee regime as the "only legitimate government." The Chief Representative of Byelorussia, Kiselyov, in the meeting on the 8th, sternly denounced the United States' policy of splitting Korea and turning South Korea into its colony. He advocated giving the Korean people the right to solve their own problems without foreign protectors and US military occupation, and giving the Korean people the opportunity to establish a unified, independent, and democratic country. He firmly opposed the establishment of a new "Commission on Korea" and expressed full support for the Soviet delegation's proposal. The Kuomintang representative and the representatives of Canada, New Zealand, and other countries completely acted as the US's echo, repeating all the lies uttered by US representative Dulles at the meeting on the 6th. On the evening of the 8th, the United States and its followers again activated their "voting machine" and passed the above-mentioned three countries' proposal. The Soviet Union and the new democratic countries all voted against it.

　　朝鲜人民民主共和国政府
  　抗议联大反动决定
  　任令美帝分裂朝鲜
    【新华社陕北十六日电】塔斯社平壤讯：朝鲜人民民主共和国外交部长朴宪永，于十二月十日致电联合国大会秘书长莱氏，并代表朝鲜政府宣布不承认联大关于朝鲜问题的决定。抗议联大政治安全委员会不允许朝鲜人民民主共和国代表团参加联大讨论关于朝鲜问题的决定。该电声称：“朝鲜人民民主共和国政府，曾一再请求阁下给予人民民主共和国代表们以参加联大会议讨论朝鲜问题的便利。朝鲜人民民主共和国政府，系以这一事实作为其主张的根据，即在讨论朝鲜问题时，联大会议应该听取朝鲜人民真正代表的意见，并通过符合我们人民利益与愿望的决定。但联大政治委员会不顾这点，完全无视我国政府的合法请求及全体朝鲜人民的意志，通过了不允许朝鲜人民民主共和国代表团参加联大会议讨论朝鲜问题的决定。朝鲜人民民主共和国政府抗议政治委员会的这一决定。朝鲜政府认为需要宣布：联大会议在没有朝鲜代表团参加的情况下，倘使通过关于朝鲜问题的决定及其他措施，则朝鲜政府及全体朝鲜人民，将不承认这种决定，并将为争取外国军队全部撤出朝鲜、争取全国统一及争取单一的独立民主国家的建立而继续进行斗争。”朴宪永并已向联大第三届会议主席伊瓦特致送同样的电报。
    【新华社陕北十三日电】巴黎消息：联大政治安全委员会于十二月六日开始讨论朝鲜问题，于八日晚结束。在讨论中，苏联代表团提出废除所谓“联合国朝鲜委员会”，斥责该委员会分裂朝鲜与批准南朝鲜五月十日伪选结果的议案。但美、澳、“中”（国民党）的代表却根据所谓“联合国朝鲜委员会”的报告，于六日提出另一提案，要求批准该委员会的报告，承认汉城政权为“朝鲜唯一合法政府”，并设立一新的“朝鲜委员会”。所谓“联合国朝鲜委员会”，是上届联大在美国把持下违反联合国宪章所建立的一个非法机构，其目的在于利用联合国的名义，以便使美国分裂朝鲜与奴役南朝鲜的计划合法化。该委员会根据美国的意志，在其报告中一面诬蔑真正代表全朝鲜人民意志的朝鲜人民民主共和国政府，一面胡说五月十日南朝鲜的“选举”滑稽剧是“民主的选举”，要求承认美国走狗李承晚政权为“唯一合法政府”。白俄罗斯首席代表基什列夫在八日会议中，严词斥责美国分裂朝鲜与变南朝鲜为其殖民地的政策。他主张给予朝鲜人民在没有外国保护人和美军占领的情况下，自己解决自己问题的权利，给予朝鲜人民建立统一、独立的民主国家的机会。他坚决反对设立新的“朝鲜委员会”，并表示完全支持苏联代表团的提案。国民党代表和加拿大、新西兰等国的代表，在发言中则完全充当美国的应声虫，重复美代表杜勒斯在六日会上所发的一切谰言。八日晚，美国及其附和者又拨动其“表决机器”，通过了上述三国的提案。苏联及新民主国家均投反对票。
