　　West German Communist Party
  　Resolutely Adheres to Marxism-Leninism and Studies the Example of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union
    【Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 27th】 Dentsu Berlin, 21st: Chairman Lehmann of the Communist Party in the three occupied zones of West Germany stated in a speech at the Third Congress of the Bavarian Communist Party: The West German Communist Party resolutely adheres to Marxism-Leninism and opposes fallacies such as Germany's "peaceful entry into socialism" and "Germany's special road to socialism." Lehmann stated that the West German Communist Party rejects the so-called "Occupation Statute" (referring to the code established by the US, Britain, and France for the occupation of West Germany when they divided Germany) and is fighting for a unified, democratic German Republic. "We hope to build Germany into a free land for German workers, a democratic republic that will never again cause war." Sommer, who was re-elected as Chairman of the Bavarian Communist Party by the Congress, stated in a speech at the Congress that the example of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union points out how to combine the struggle for socialism and the struggle for national independence in order to avoid degenerating into nationalism. The primary task of the Bavarian Communist Party is to ensure that all party members have a solid foundation in Marxism-Leninism. Sommer announced that the Bavarian Communist Party will cooperate closely with members and masses of the Bavarian Social Democratic Party to defeat the plans of the reactionary leadership of the Social Democratic Party. The Congress unanimously adopted a resolution for peace, calling on the German people to support the Soviet Union's peace policy.

　　西德共产党
  　坚决奉行马列主义学习苏联共产党榜样
    【新华社陕北二十七日电】电通社柏林二十一日讯：西德三占区共产党主席雷曼在巴伐利亚共产党第三届大会上发表演说称：西德共产党坚决奉行马克思——列宁主义，反对所谓德国“和平进入社会主义”、“德国走向社会主义的特殊道路”等谬论。雷曼称，西德共产党拒绝所谓“占领法规”（按为美英法分裂德国所制订的占领西德的法典），并为统一民主的德意志共和国而奋斗，“我们希望把德国建设成为德国工人的自由国土，一个民主共和国，永不再引起战争”。由大会重选为巴伐利亚共产党主席的夏末尔在大会上演说称，苏联共产党的榜样，指明怎样使争取社会主义和争取国家独立的斗争结合起来，以免流于民族主义。巴伐利亚共产党的首要任务，是使全体党员都有马克思——列宁主义的坚实基础。夏末尔宣布巴伐利亚共产党将与巴伐利亚社会民主党党员与群众密切合作，以击败社会民主党反动领导的计划。大会最后一致通过争取和平的决议，号召德国人民支持苏联的和平政策。
