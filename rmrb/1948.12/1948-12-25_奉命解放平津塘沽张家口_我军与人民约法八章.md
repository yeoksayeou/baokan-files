Proclamation by the Pingjin Front Headquarters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army

The People's Liberation Army, under orders to annihilate the Kuomintang bandit troops and liberate the cities of Beiping, Tianjin, Tanggu, and Zhangjiakou, hereby announces the following eight-point covenant, which we wish to observe jointly with all our people:

　　(1) Protect the lives and property of all the people in the cities. It is hoped that all our people will strictly maintain order and pursue their livelihoods in peace. Any counter-revolutionaries or other saboteurs who take the opportunity to cause trouble, loot, or destroy will be severely punished once discovered.

　　(2) Protect national industry and commerce. All privately-run factories, shops, banks, warehouses, etc., will be protected and shall not be violated. It is hoped that all employees in these industries will continue production as usual, and all shops will continue business as usual.

　　(3) Confiscate bureaucrat-capital. All factories, shops, banks, warehouses, railways, post offices, telegraphs, electric lights, telephones, waterworks, etc., run by the Kuomintang reactionary government shall be taken over by the democratic government. If a portion of the capital is privately owned, its ownership will be recognized after investigation. All personnel employed in bureaucrat-capital enterprises must continue to serve as before until the democratic government takes over, and are responsible for protecting assets, machinery, charts, rosters, archives, etc., pending inventory and takeover. Those who protect them meritoriously will be rewarded, and those who sabotage them through negligence will be punished. Those who wish to continue serving will be given positions commensurate with their abilities after the democratic government takes over.

　　(4) Protect schools, hospitals, cultural and educational institutions, sports venues, and all other public buildings. No one may destroy them. Teachers, staff of cultural, educational, and health institutions, and personnel employed in other public welfare institutions are expected to continue serving as usual. Our army will protect them all and shall not violate them.

　　(5) Except for chief war criminals and counter-revolutionaries guilty of heinous crimes, officials of the Kuomintang provincial, municipal, and county-level government agencies, police personnel, and district, town, township, and baojia personnel who do not resist with arms or plot sabotage will not be taken prisoner or arrested. The above-mentioned personnel are responsible for remaining at their posts, obeying the orders of our army and the democratic government, and protecting the assets and archives of various agencies, etc., pending takeover. Those among these personnel who have skills and no reactionary behavior or serious misdeeds will be employed by the democratic government on a case-by-case basis. Those who take the opportunity to sabotage, steal, embezzle, abscond with public funds, public property, or archives, or refuse to hand them over will be punished according to law.

　　(6) To ensure urban security and stabilize social order, all scattered soldiers and vagrants should surrender and report to the local army units and garrison headquarters or public security bureau. Those who voluntarily surrender and report and hand over all weapons will not be prosecuted. Those who delay reporting and hide weapons will be arrested and investigated, and will not be tolerated. Those who harbor them without reporting will be subject to due punishment.

　　(7) Protect the safety of the lives and property of foreign nationals. All foreign nationals must abide by the laws of our army and the democratic government, must not engage in espionage activities, must not engage in activities against the Chinese revolution, and must not conceal war criminals, counter-revolutionaries, or other criminals; otherwise, they will be subject to the legal sanctions of our army and the democratic government.

　　(8) Whether before or after our army enters the city, all citizens and people from all walks of life in the city must jointly be responsible for maintaining order throughout the city and preventing destruction. Those who protect it meritoriously will be rewarded, and those who plot sabotage will be punished.

Our army has strict discipline, engages in fair buying and selling, and will not take even a needle or thread from the people. It is hoped that all our people will live and work in peace and contentment, and will not easily believe rumors or disturb themselves. This is most important.
