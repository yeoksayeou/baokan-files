Xinhua News Agency, Jidong, 29th – After liberation, the workers of Tangshan immediately handed over the important state-owned factories to the People's Government for management completely intact and continued working without interruption. Six days before the liberation of Tangshan, the workers of the Tangshan Power Plant organized a factory protection and maintenance team that patrolled the factory to prevent sabotage by Kuomintang secret agents. Before the enemy fled, they completely closed all the main gates and set up sentry posts at water sources and each gate to prevent bandits from invading. Before and after the liberation of Tangshan, the power plant workers did not stop supplying electricity for a moment. Workers at the Tangshan Railway Factory took guns from the factory police and organized an armed picket team to protect the factory safely and without damage. After the People's Liberation Army entered the Tangshan Telephone Bureau, employees immediately used the telephone to notify various factories, companies, and businesses, informing them that Tangshan had been completely liberated and that all mine and factory employees should protect their mines and factories, preventing damage to machinery and archives. Before the People's Liberation Army entered the city, the staff of the broadcasting station dismantled and preserved important components. After the People's Liberation Army entered the city, the station was redecorated and completed in half an hour. At 10:00 a.m. that day, the news of the liberation of Tangshan and the Eight Articles of Agreement of the People's Liberation Army were broadcast throughout the city by the radio station. The workers of the original Kuomintang Tangshan Daily locked the gates during the day and guarded the machines inside the factory. After the People's Liberation Army entered the city, they immediately rushed to print 6,000 copies of the PLA's entry proclamation and posted them all over the city overnight.

　　唐山各工厂及矿区工人
  　自动保护工厂机器
    解放后即交政府接管继续工作
    【新华社冀东二十九日电】唐山的工人们在解放后，立刻将各重要国营工厂完整无损地交予人民政府接管，并且不停顿地继续工作。唐山发电所工人在该市解放前六天，就组织起护厂维持队，在厂内巡逻，防止国民党特务破坏。敌人逃窜之前，他们将各大门完全关闭，并在水源及各门设立岗哨，防匪侵入。唐山市解放前后，该厂工人没有片刻停止供电。唐山火车工厂的工人从厂警手里取来了枪支，组织起武装纠察队，保卫了工厂的安全无损。唐山电话局员工，在解放军进入该局后，立刻用电话通知各工厂、公司、商号，告诉他们唐山已完全解放。要各矿厂职工护厂护矿，勿使机器、档案受到损失。广播电台的职工，在解放军进入该市前，把重要机件拆下保存起来。解放军入城后，半小时即重新装修完竣。当日十时，唐山解放的消息和人民解放军的约法八章，便由广播电台传遍全市。原国民党唐山日报工人，白天锁了大门在厂内看守机器，解放军入城后，即连夜赶印出解放军入城布告六千份，遍贴全城。
