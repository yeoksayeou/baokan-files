　　The People's Dabie Mountains

　　The People's Liberation Army, which has victoriously persisted in the Dabie Mountain liberated area, is now expanding from the mountainous areas to the plains. The main strongholds of the enemy entrenched in the hinterland of the Dabie Mountains have been captured by the Liberation Army, and the three county towns of Jinzhai (Lihuang), Zhuwumiao (Yuexi), and Xinji (Jingfu) have also been successively recovered. The remaining Kuomintang bandit troops are now only shrinking into a few turtle shells in the marginal areas. The victory of persisting in the Dabie Mountains is the victory of the people; the Dabie Mountains belong to the people.

　　Due to the continuous victories of the Central Plains Liberation Army and the large number of enemy troops annihilated in the Central Plains, the Dabie Mountain military and civilians began to take the initiative to attack in June of this year.

　　On June 10th, in the battle to recover Muzi Store in Macheng County and defeat the bandit Zheng Jiaxian's troops, the Liberation Army captured a letter written by the Kuomintang bandit army's Seventh Division (Army) 172nd Brigade Commander to Bandit Zheng on April 28th from Tengjiabao, Luotian. The letter stated: "The troops at Muzi Store are being transferred, preparing to advance north at any time for suppression. If the Muzi Store self-defense force is attacked by 'bandits', as long as they can fight for four hours, Tengjiabao can arrive to reinforce." However, this time, not only did Bandit Zheng not receive reinforcements, but Tengjiabao was also recovered on June 16th, annihilating two companies of the 171st Division of the enemy and 300 bandits from Luotian. After this, in a series of victorious attacks in the Pih River battle, the Jiuxie Mountain battle, etc., the Liberation Army forced the remaining bandit troops and bandits to flee in a panic, abandoning most of the strongholds in the hinterland of the Dabie Mountains.

　　The victory of the Dabie Mountain military and civilians was obtained from arduous tests. This spring, bandit Bai Chongxi, with about twenty brigades, carried out repeated "sweeps" and "suppressions" in the Dabie Mountains, using the "three-all policy" of burning, killing, and looting, namely the so-called "total war," to create no-man's land in the hinterland of the Dabie Mountains. Bandit troops raped women and captured men upon sight. Hu Lian, commander of the Bandit 11th Division, said: "In the Dabie Mountains, people must be captured when seen. If they are not captured, these people will join the Liberation Army." People fled from the Kuomintang army like fleeing from the plague, called "running from the Nationalist bandits." Tragic incidents occurred in the Bashi, Luotian, and Huanggang areas where the Kuomintang army used machine guns to strafe the people. The Wujiadian area of Jinzhai (Lihuang) County and the Daguling area of Huangmei County were uninhabited for dozens of miles after being "suppressed" by the Kuomintang bandit army. There, the villages only had broken houses, ruined stoves, broken pots and bowls, broken furniture, and tiles left; the fields were overgrown with weeds. The military and civilians of the Dabie Mountains said: "The Japanese were 'three-all'; Chiang Kai-shek and Bai Chongxi are 'ten-all'."

　　The more difficult it was, the closer the unity of the Dabie Mountain military and civilians became. (The Kuomintang bandit army's inhuman atrocities further inspired the commanders and fighters of the Liberation Army's noble feelings of rescuing the people. They disregarded rain and wading, climbing mountains and walking small roads, regardless of hunger, fatigue, bloodshed, and sacrifice, actively attacking the Kuomintang bandit army. In the most difficult April and May of this year, the Eyu Military Region alone, according to incomplete statistics, annihilated more than a thousand bandits and Wang Keyi's troops in Huanggang. The Liberation Army rescued farmers captured by the bandit army everywhere, recovered the looted property for the people, and destroyed the enemy and puppet regimes. In the intervals between battles, the Liberation Army also helped the people with production, transplanting rice seedlings, harvesting rice, and collecting beans. A certain unit of the Second Sub-district of the Eyu Military Region, in addition to chopping firewood and grinding flour for the masses, developed the "fill the jar" movement into a "fill the neighborhood" and "fill the entire village" movement. This made the people of the Dabie Mountains infinitely grateful to the Liberation Army. They said: "The Nationalist bandits come to harm people; the Liberation Army comes to save people." The common people call the Liberation Army the "life-saving army." When the farmers were harvesting rice as tall as a person, they all said with joy: "The common people should really come to the fore. Since the Liberation Army came to the Dabie Mountains, we have had good harvests in both last year and this year."

　　After the Chinese Communist Party's social policies for the new areas were spread to the Dabie Mountains, they were warmly embraced by the broad masses of the people. After the masses read the announcements of the democratic government, they all discussed and said: "If we do this, our Dabie Mountains will surely be successful." In the past, the landlords who had fled also returned one after another. In a certain district of Shangcheng, 90% have returned. A landlord who fled from Hankou said: "Bai Chongxi forced men in Hankou aged eighteen to forty-eight to receive military training. They exercised from six to nine every morning. Not to mention fighting, the exercise alone will kill people." A landlord who fled from Tingsiqiao said: "There are great floods in Hubei and Hunan, and food is expensive. The Kuomintang army arrests young people upon sight. It's simply impossible to live there." Many enemy and puppet personnel also repented and started anew to the democratic government. A pseudo-township chief in the Third Sub-district of Eyu wrote a letter to the democratic government requesting to go home, saying: "I will never be reactionary again; I will never oppress the common people again."

　　人民的大别山
    胜利坚持大别山解放区的人民解放军，现在正从山岳地带向平川扩展。敌人窜踞大别山腹地的主要据点均已为解放军拔除，金寨（立煌）、朱屋庙（岳西）、新集（经扶）三个县城也已先后收复了。残留的国民党匪军现只缩在边缘区的少数乌龟壳里了。大别山坚持的胜利是人民的胜利，大别山是人民的。
    由于中原解放军的不断胜利，中原敌军的大量被歼，今年六月，大别山军民即开始了主动出击。
    六月十日，解放军在收复麻城县木子店，击溃土匪郑家贤部的战斗中，缴获了国民党匪军第七师（军）一七二旅旅长于四月二十八日从罗田滕家堡给郑匪的信，信上说：“木子店部队他调，准备随时向北进剿。木子店自卫武装如遇‘匪’袭，只要能作战四小时，滕家堡即可到达增援。”但这次非但郑匪未获增援，而且紧接着于六月十六日连滕家堡也收复了，歼敌一七一师两个连及罗田土匪一部三百人。这以后，解放军在泼皮河战斗、九歇山战斗等一连串的胜利出击下，迫使残留匪军及土匪狼狈逃窜，放弃了大别山腹地的大部据点。
    大别山军民的胜利是从艰苦的考验中获得的。今春白匪崇禧以约二十个旅的兵力，在大别山进行着反复“扫荡”、“清剿”，以烧杀抢掠的三光政策，即所谓“总体战”，在大别山腹地制造无人区，匪军见妇女就奸，见男人就抓。匪十一师师长胡琏说：“在大别山见人就要抓，如不抓光，这些人都会参加解放军。”人民象逃避瘟疫一样逃避着国民党军，叫做“跑国匪反”。在霸水、罗田、黄岗地区都发生过国民党军用机枪向人民扫射的惨事。金寨（立煌）县吴家店地区和黄梅县大古岭地区，经国民党匪军“清剿”后数十里内渺无人烟。在那里，村庄只剩下破屋烂灶，打烂的锅碗，残破的家具和瓦片，田地长满了荒草。大别山的军民说：“日本人是三光，蒋介石、白崇禧是十光。”
    越是艰苦，大别山军民的团结就越发紧密（国民党匪军毫无人性的暴行，更加激发了解放军指战员们的解救人民的崇高感情，他们不顾淋雨涉水，爬大山走小路，不顾饥饿疲劳、流血牺牲，积极地打击国民党匪军。在最艰苦的今年四、五月间，仅鄂豫军区不完全统计，就歼灭了匪军和黄岗土匪王克夷部千余人。解放军到处解救被匪军抓去的农民，为人民夺回被抢掠的财物，摧毁敌伪政权。在战斗空隙中，解放军并帮助人民生产，插秧、割稻、收豆。鄂豫军区二分区某部队除为群众打柴、磨面外，把“满缸”运动发展成“满四邻”、“满全村”的运动，这使大别山的人民对解放军感激无限，他们说：“国匪来了害人，解放军来了救人。”老百姓都把解放军叫做“救命军”。当农民们收割着人样高的稻谷时，不约而同地满怀欢乐地说：“老百姓真该出头了，解放军一来到大别山，去年和今年，我们接连都是好收成。”
    中国共产党的新区社会政策传到了大别山后，得到了广大人民的热烈拥护。群众看过了民主政府的布告后，都议论纷纷，说：“照这样办，我们大别山一定能办成功。”过去逃亡的地主也纷纷回来了，商城某区已回来了百分之九十。一个从汉口逃回的地主说：“白崇禧强迫汉口市民十八岁到四十八岁的男子都受军训，每天早上六点到九点下操，不说打仗，操也把人操死了。”一个从汀泗桥逃回的地主说：“湖北、湖南大水灾，粮食贵，国民党军见年轻人就抓，在哪里简直活不了。”许多敌伪人员也纷纷向民主政府悔过自新，鄂豫三分区一个伪乡长向民主政府写信要求回家说：“我以后再不反动了，再不压迫老百姓了。”
