　　Trial-Manufactures Sugar Shaking Machine Successfully
　　[Report from this newspaper] The Huada University Agricultural Machinery Factory has successfully trial-manufactured a sugar shaking machine. The first batch of ten machines has been distributed to the Taihang, Taiyue, and Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region areas. The sugar shaking machine produced by the factory is characterized by its small size, refinement, and high speed. Each turn of the hand crank rotates the sugar container sixty-four times, and six catties of fine sugar can be produced every five minutes, which greatly helps to improve sugar quality and reduce costs. Washing machines and slicing machines for sugar beet, the raw material for sugar production, have also been manufactured. It is estimated that each complete set of machines can produce 150 catties of sugar per day. The second batch of machines is currently being rushed to completion and will be finished within half a month. After completion, they will be distributed to sugar farmers in various regions for winter sugar production.
