　　Using Rural Environment
  　To Cover Up Sluggish and Lax Work
  　A Self-Criticism from a Publishing Worker
　　Why has our newspaper distribution work consistently been poor? It's slow and often makes mistakes. Readers have offered many suggestions, but there hasn't been much improvement. In the past, we would calmly explain a set of reasons: publishing and distribution are not done well because there are too many difficulties. First, we are in a dispersed rural environment. It takes ten minutes just to send the manuscript from the editorial department to the typesetting room, and another four or five hours to deliver the paper mold to the printing factory. The publishing process of a newspaper takes almost ten hours just spent on the road. The publishing process of a newspaper is also the most complicated, with about twenty procedures just from sending the manuscript to making the paper mold. Living in a scattered rural environment, how can it not take more time? At the same time, the material conditions are not good, transportation is inconvenient, there are not enough workers, and the higher-ups do not pay attention to distribution work or allocate strong cadres. It seems that the newspaper publishing and distribution work is so difficult that it cannot be improved!

　　If we carefully examine the work, we will find that the crux of the problem does not lie in these objective difficulties, but in ourselves. Living in the countryside for a long time, we have become infected with the scattered and procrastinating habits of small-scale agricultural producers. We are not aware of the importance of publishing time, and because we are constantly around the newspaper, we do not understand the pain of not seeing the newspaper, so procrastination and laxity become commonplace. The working method is also artisanal. We do this and then do that. When one department is busy, another department has nothing to do. Isolated and dispersed, it's not like a big machine where one link connects to another, but they are disconnected. The errors of one department cannot be checked by another department until readers write in to discover them. We have never scientifically and meticulously organized our work according to the process and objective conditions of the work. The reason is that we overestimate our own strength, emphasize difficulties, and take advantage of the leaders' lack of technical understanding to cover up our bureaucratic style of not conducting in-depth research and ensuring the implementation of decisions. We do not know how to utilize our subjective initiative to overcome the various difficulties in the rural environment, unnecessarily lengthening the publishing and distribution process, turning the principle of "publishing serving distribution" into "distribution serving publishing," resulting in unnecessary losses in our work.

　　After a preliminary examination, we recognize that using the scattered rural environment and backward material conditions as a cover for our inefficiency and lack of scientific and meticulous organization in our work, this procrastination and laxity, is a serious rural-style bureaucratic work style that is irresponsible to the Party and the readers. After analyzing its harm, everyone's understanding began to change. We decided to make the greatest effort to improve work efficiency, strengthen work organization, overcome the bad habits of scattering and procrastination, and continuously check to ensure the implementation of resolutions.

### 借口农村环境　掩饰工作的拖拉松懈　一个出版工作者的检查

　　借口农村环境
  　掩饰工作的拖拉松懈
  　一个出版工作者的检查
    我们的报纸发行工作为什么一直做不好？慢而且常出错，读者提了不少意见，仍不见什么改进。在过去，对于这样的责难，我们会泰然自若地给你讲出一套道理：出版发行搞不好，是因为困难太多。首先，我们是处在分散的农村环境，从编辑部把稿子送到排字房就要十分钟的功夫，打好纸型送到印刷厂又得四五个钟头，一份报纸的出版过程，差不多有十小时是花费在走路上。而报纸的出版过程又最为复杂，只从发稿到打好纸型就要二十来道手续，在农村住地分散的条件下，怎能不多费时间？同时物质条件不好，交通不方便，工人不够用，再加上上级不重视发行工作，不配备强的干部等等，似乎是报纸出版发行工作真是困难到无法改进了！
    假若认真地把工作检查一下，就会发现问题的症结并不在于这些客观困难，还是在我们自己身上。我们长时期住在农村里，沾染上小农生产者散漫拖延的习惯，觉察不出出版时间的重要，再加上我们自己成天守着报纸，就体会不到看不到报纸的痛苦，拖拉松懈也就习以为常。工作方式也是手工业式的，做了这个再做那个，这一个部门忙着的时候，另一个部门却无事可做。孤立分散，不是象一个大机器一样，一个环节衔接着另一个环节，而是互不联系，这个部门的错误，到另一个部门就检查不出来，直到读者来信，才能发现。我们总是没有按照工作的过程规律、客观条件，科学地精密地组织自己的工作。原因就在于我们过低估计自己力量，强调困难，钻领导者不懂技术的空子，去掩饰自己不深入研究，保证决议的执行的官僚主义作风。不知道去发挥自己主观能动性，去克服农村环境里的种种困难，使得出版和发行过程不必要的拖长，把“出版服从发行”的原则变成“发行服从出版”，致使工作遭受到不必要的损失。
    经过了初步检查，我们认识了这种以农村环境分散，物质条件落后等作为自己工作中不讲求效率，缺乏科学的精密的组织性的拖拉松懈现象的掩护，是一种对党对读者不负责的严重的农村式的官僚主义的作风。分析了它的危害后，大家的认识开始转变，决定以最大的努力，提高工作效率加强工作的组织性，克服散漫拖延的恶习，并以不断的检查保证决议的执行。
