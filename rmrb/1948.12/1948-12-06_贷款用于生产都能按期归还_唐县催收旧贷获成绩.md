Loans Used for Production Can Be Repaid on Time
Tang County Achieves Success in Collecting Old Loans

[North Yue News] Since spring to autumn this year, Tang County has issued a total of 597,452 jin of various types of production loans in grain. Recently, farmers in various villages have responded to the call to repay old loans and are actively repaying them. As of the 20th of last month, 400,000 jin have been repaid, accounting for more than 66 percent of the total amount lent. Another 100,000 jin have not yet reached the due date. The Fifth and Sixth Districts have been the most active in repayment, and even the First District, which is poor and has suffered from famine, has repaid more than 65 percent. (Whether there is a phenomenon in this area of urging repayment in the same way as in non-disaster areas, regardless of the production and life of disaster victims, should be examined and studied. – Editor)

Some problems have also occurred in this loan repayment. For example, some initially disregarded the situation and stipulated that "all agricultural loans must be repaid by the end of October," which caused households whose loans were not yet due to complain, "This is not in accordance with the contract!" Some farmers who borrowed grain to buy livestock also reflected that "the time is too tight to manage." And individual village agricultural loan committee members even said when urging the repayment of loans: "You have to repay the agricultural loan even if you sell your livestock." These phenomena have been corrected successively after being discovered.

Several issues can be seen in this loan repayment: The first is to prove that the correct policy of agricultural loans must be to organize production. This year's agricultural loan households in Tang County, all those who used the loans for production have benefited, and almost all of them have been able to repay on schedule this time. Secondly, in the methods of supporting production, we should study different production undertakings and focus on issuing loans. For example, Tang County suffered from egalitarianism in this year's livestock and well-digging loans. In some areas, the average loan grain for digging a well was about 30 jin per well, resulting in only some very shallow small earthen wells being dug, which are now unusable. These experiences should be carefully noted in future agricultural loans.

The reasons for the masses' active repayment of agricultural loans this time are: First, the agricultural loan policy this year has been grasped relatively well, and most of the loans can be used for production, so they have the ability to repay. Secondly, the county party committee attaches importance to it. The county government has made arrangements and posted notices regarding the repayment of agricultural loans. Cadres from various party, government, and civil systems in the districts and villages have unanimously mobilized and urged repayment. For example, the Fifth and Sixth District Party Committees have personally presided over village cadre meetings to discuss the repayment of agricultural loans. In addition, the promotion of cooperatives, as well as the district and village agricultural loan committee members, have played a significant role in the publicity and urging of the repayment of agricultural loans.

### 贷款用于生产都能按期归还　唐县催收旧贷获成绩

　　贷款用于生产都能按期归还
  　唐县催收旧贷获成绩
    【北岳讯】唐县自今春至秋季，共发放各种生产贷粮五十九万七千四百五十二斤。最近各村农民响应归还旧贷的号召，积极还贷，截至上月二十日止，已归还四十万斤。占贷出总数百分之六十六强，另有十万斤尚未到期。归还中以五、六区为最积极，贫困又遭灾荒的一区，也已归还了百分之六十五以上。（此种地区，是否有不顾灾民生产与生活和其他非灾区一样催收的现象，应作检查研究。——编者）
    此次还贷中，也曾发生过些毛病。如开始有的不顾情况，规定：“所有农贷一律在十月底归还”，使不到期户反映：“不按契约办事！”另有些贷粮买牲口的农民反映：“时间太紧，转不过来。”而个别村庄农贷委员，在督促归还贷款时竟说：“卖了牲口也得还农贷”。这些现象经发觉后，已先后纠正。
    此次还贷中，可看出几个问题：首先是证明农贷的正确方针，必须是组织生产。唐县今年的农贷户，凡是用之于生产的，都得到了利益，这次差不多都能如期归还。其次，在扶植生产的方法上，应研究不同生产事业，有重点的发放。如唐县今年在牲口、打井贷款上，就吃了平均主义的亏，某地打井贷粮平均每眼三十斤左右，结果只能打些很浅的小土井，现已不能使用。这些经验在今后农贷中应深加注意。
    这次群众归还农贷积极的原因：首先是今年农贷政策掌握比较好，绝大部分的贷款都能用于生产，因此有能力归还。其次是县委领导上的重视，县政府关于归还农贷曾进行布置与张贴布告，区村党政民各系统干部一致动员与督促，如五、六区分委，都曾亲自主持村干会议，讨论归还农贷。此外，推进社以及小区与村农贷委员，对归还农贷的宣传督促上，都起到不少作用。　　　（黎光）
