　　The Japanese Workers' Movement
    Markov
    American employers and their lackeys, along with the occupation authorities, are infuriated by every strike launched by Japanese workers, as they want to ensure a reliable reserve army of cheap labor. However, strikes are inevitable because the living conditions of the working people remain as dire as in the past. A Christian Science Monitor reporter who recently traveled to Japanese industrial centers declared: "Most Japanese workers after the surrender live and work in conditions almost identical to those of two hundred years ago." Labor brokers still travel to rural areas of Japan, buying girls from their parents to work in yarn mills and factories. Women do the same work as men but receive only half the wages. The labor of children aged eleven to fourteen is still exploited on a large scale; they receive only a quarter of the wages of adults, but do the same kind and amount of work. American merchants not only decided to maintain the current situation, which condemns the working people to slavery of hunger and poverty, but they also insist on reducing workers' wages. Today, the nominal average wage of Japanese workers is twenty-seven to twenty-eight times higher than before the war, but prices have increased sixty-five times. The Japanese government has not controlled the profits of capitalists but has established wage controls and kept wages at extremely low levels. The picture of worker poverty would not be complete if it were not mentioned that 5.78 million households, or one-third of the Japanese population, are still homeless. Most workers live in dilapidated thatched houses, with twenty-five people crammed into houses measuring twenty-five to thirty square meters. The suffering of the Japanese working class is further exacerbated by unemployment, and there is still no practical social insurance to this day. The budget proposed by the Ashida Cabinet and passed by the parliament for 1948 to 1949, greatly exceeds last year's budget, with 70 percent of its revenue coming from the working people. This new plunder of the workers will encounter strong resistance from the workers. This is evidenced by the entire development of the workers' movement in Japan since its surrender.
    After the "Greater Japan Industrial Patriotic Association," organized in imitation of the Nazis, was dissolved on September 30, 1945, new trade unions began to organize in Japan, and farmers' associations also appeared. The Communist Party emerged from underground, and the Socialist Party began its activities. The upsurge of the Japanese workers' movement lasted until the autumn of 1946, during which time the workers' movement focused on economic demands. However, the political awareness of the masses was evident. In the April 1946 parliamentary elections, the Communist Party and the Socialist Party won 12 million votes. The Japanese reactionaries immediately felt the threat lurking in the unity of democratic forces. Under MacArthur's protection, the Japanese government began to ban demonstrations and assemblies and laid off workers on a large scale, intending to hinder the development of trade unions. Despite all these measures, the workers' movement did not decline but entered a higher stage of development. The "October Offensive" of 1946 spread to almost all industrial sectors and government agencies and took on a clear political character. The Japanese government immediately retaliated by passing the drastic Labor Relations Adjustment Law, which authorized the government to interfere in any labor dispute for the purpose of suppression. The general strike, which was prepared to demand the resignation of the Yoshida Cabinet (originally scheduled for February 1, 1947), led the development of the Japanese workers' movement into another stage. Although MacArthur banned the strike, the Yoshida government was forced to resign. In March of this year, there were 194 officially registered labor disputes, 49 of which developed into major strikes, with a total of 818,418 workers participating. Regarding trade union organizations, more than 200 new Japanese trade unions were established in the first half of 1948. By the end of February, there were 6,334,400 trade union members in Japan (note: the June statistics had increased to 6.5 million).
    The basic principles recorded in the Far Eastern Commission's decision are violated every day by the American occupation authorities. First, the American occupation authorities cruelly persecute trade union leaders. On March 30, 1948, the 200,000 members of the National Postal and Communications Workers' Union held a strike in western Japan. The chairman of the union's Tokyo branch, Toshio Yamaguchi, and two other leaders were arrested by the American Eighth Army. Yamaguchi was severely tortured by the military court and sentenced to three years of hard labor and a fine of 75,000 yen. To this day, the American authorities continue to arrest worker leaders. The American authorities are not satisfied with banning strikes, but also ban assemblies and demonstrations. In Tokyo and other major cities, American police take pictures of speakers at workers' rallies and create blacklists of participants. Since 1946, strike-breaking teams have been formed in factories with government support, and some prefectures have even attempted to establish official yellow unions. In March of this year, Envoy Draper ostensibly came to Japan to study the "economic recovery" issue, but in reality, he was looking for ways to intensify the exploitation of Japan by American capital. In order to guarantee the interests of American investment, the mission considered it necessary to end such troublesome obstacles as collective bargaining and basic labor laws. In a memorandum submitted to the State Department upon his return to Washington, the mission specifically recommended that trade unions should be placed under the control of the new government, that workers should be firmly prohibited from participating in factory management departments and holding strikes, and that existing labor laws should be replaced with new legislation modeled after the Taft-Hartley Act. The Ashida Cabinet thoroughly implemented Washington's orders. On July 22, MacArthur sent a letter to Ashida, ordering him to immediately and fundamentally revise the National Public Service Act to prohibit government employees from participating in strikes or other labor disputes. In order to comply with this order, the Japanese government stated at the special session of the parliament in September that the existing legislation on trade unions and labor relations would be fundamentally revised. What the Japanese reactionaries and the American occupation authorities fear most is the unity of trade unions, the growing influence of progressive trade unions, and the influence of the Communist Party. In January of this year, the Japan Times declared: "It is expected that removing the influence of communism from the workers' movement will be the characteristic of the government's new labor policy." The Japanese Federation of Labor actively participated in the reactionary anti-communist movement. It organized a fascist anti-communist alliance in the National Railway Workers' Union and several other unions. This anti-communist alliance planned and carried out the assassination of Tokuda, the Secretary-General of the Japanese Communist Party. In the branches of the Industrial Trade Unions Federation, Socialist Party agents organize secret conspiracies.
    However, the Japanese working class resisted this movement with a firm and unified will. The search and persecution of the Japanese Communist Party did not weaken its influence among the working masses. The Shibaura Electric Workers' Union Federation expressed the confidence of the majority of Japanese workers, declaring in a resolution: "In fact, only the Communist Party is fighting for the independence of Japan and the true interests of the workers." At the congress of the Electric Workers' Union, which has 100,000 members, communists were elected as chairman and vice-chairman of the executive committee. Communists were also elected to the leading organs of the Government Railway Workers' Union. The working class does not confine itself to the struggle for its own economic interests, but acts as the vanguard of the domestic democratic forces. On June 9, a liaison committee was established to maintain contact between workers and farmers' associations. Forty-eight trade unions participated in this organization. The Japanese Federation of Labor and the right-wing Socialist Party boycotted this new organization, believing that its establishment was a step towards a democratic united front of the Japanese people. The high degree of division in the workers' movement, the insufficient political maturity of some workers, the persistence of guild and reformist traditions in some trade unions, and the oppressive anti-labor policies of the Japanese government and the American occupation authorities have created serious obstacles to the further growth and consolidation of the trade union movements, but these obstacles are being successfully overcome. In the three years since the war, the Japanese working class has demonstrated that it can not only fight to uphold its own interests, but also lead the broad masses of working people to eliminate the remnants of fascism and militarism and to fight for the independence of the Japanese nation and the establishment of its true democracy.

　　日本工人运动
    马尔科夫
    美国雇主及其从仆和占领当局，被日本工人发动的每次罢工所恼怒，因为他们想保证有一个可靠的贱价劳动力的后备军。然而，罢工是不可避免的，因为劳动人民的生活状况仍然象过去那样恶劣。最近游历日本工业中心的基督教科学箴言报记者宣称：“投降后大多数日本工人，几乎在二百年前同样的条件下生活和劳动着。”招工代理人仍然往来于日本乡村地区，把女孩子从她们父母手里买到纱厂和工厂做工。妇女们做与男人同等的工作，但只获得男人一半的工资。十一岁到十四岁儿童的劳动，仍被大规模地剥削，他们只获得成年人工资的四分之一，但做着同类同量的工作。美国商人们不只决定保留目前的、注定劳动人民要受到饥饿与贫穷的奴役状况，他们还坚持要减低工人的工资。今天，日本工人名义上的平均工资为高于战前的二十七倍到二十八倍，但物价已增涨了六十五倍。日本政府没有控制资本家的利润，却建立了工资管制并将工资保持在极低的水平上。假如没有讲到日本人民有五百七十八万户或日本人口的三分之一仍然无家可归的话，工人贫困的图景就不是完全的。大多数的工人住在破草房里，面积二十五到三十方公尺大的房屋，要容纳二十五人。日本工人阶级的痛苦由于失业而进一步加剧了，直到今天还没有实际的社会保险。一九四八年到一九四九年由芦田内阁提出并经议会通过的预算，大大超过去年的预算，其收入的百分之七十来自劳动人民。这种对工人的新掠夺，将遭遇工人方面的有力抵抗。这是为日本投降以来工人运动整个发展所证明了的。
    一九四五年九月三十日，仿效纳粹组成的“大日本产业报国会”被解散后，新的职工会开始在日本组织起来，农会也出现了，共产党从地下起来，社会党开始了活动。日本工人运动高涨的阶段，持续到一九四六年秋，那一时期，工人运动集中在经济要求方面。但是，群众的政治觉悟是明显的，在一九四六年四月的议会选举中，共产党和社会党获得了一千二百万票。日本反动派立刻感到潜伏在民主力量团结中的威胁。日本政府在麦克阿瑟的庇护下，开始禁止示威和集会，并大量解雇工人，意在妨碍职工会的发展。尽管有这一切措施，工人运动并未衰颓，却进入一个更高发展的阶段。一九四六年的“十月攻势”，几乎扩及所有工业部门和政府机关，且带着明显的政治性质。日本政府立即以通过剧烈的劳工关系调整法来实行报复，这一立法授权政府以镇压为目的而干涉任何劳工纠纷。为要求吉田内阁辞职而准备的总罢工（曾预定在一九四七年二月一日举行），将日本工人运动的发展导入了另一阶段。虽然麦克阿瑟禁止了罢工，但吉田政府被迫辞职了。今年三月，官方登记的劳工纠纷有一百九十四件，其中四十九件发展为大罢工，参加工人总数达八十一万八千四百一十八人。五月与六月发生了大罢工，六月五日宣布的铁路工人罢工，参加者达十万人。职工组织方面。一九四八年前半年成立了二百个以上的日本新工会。到二月底，日本职工会会员有六百三十三万四千四百人（按：六月统计已增至六百五十万人）。
    远东委员会决定中记载着的基本原则，每天都被美国占领当局所违背。首先是美国占领当局残酷地迫害职工会领袖。一九四八年三月三十日，全国递信工人工会二十万会员在西部日本举行罢工，该会东京分会主席山口俊夫及另外两位领袖均被美国第八军逮捕，山口并遭到军事法庭的严刑拷打，判处三年苦役和七万五千日元的罚金。到今天，美国当局仍继续逮捕工人领袖。美国当局不以禁止罢工为满足，且禁止集会和示威。在东京和其他大城市，美国警察拍摄工人大会上演说者的像片，并制出参加会议者的黑名单。一九四六年以来，在政府支持下，罢工破坏队已在工厂中成立，其些县内还企图成立官方的黄色工会。今年三月，德莱柏使图表面上是来日本研究“经济复兴”问题，实际上是寻找各种方法加紧美国资本对日本的剥削。为了保证美国投资的利益，该使团认为有必要结束这种烦恼的障碍，如集体议价、基本的劳工法等类。该使团在归返华盛顿时提交国务院的备忘录中，特别建议职工会应置于新政府控制下，坚决禁止工人参加工厂管理部与举行罢工，将现有劳工法代以模仿塔夫脱——哈特莱法制订的新立法。芦田内阁彻底执行华盛顿的命令。七月二十二日，麦克阿瑟给芦田一封信，命令他立即并根本修改国家公务员法，禁止政府雇员参加罢工或其他劳工纠纷。为服从这个命令，日本政府在九月议会特别会议上称：现有关于职工会与劳工关系的立法，将予以根本修改。日本反动派和美国占领当局最为恐惧的，是职工会的团结、进步工会的增长的影响和共产党的影响。今年一月，日本时报宣称：“预料从工人运动中去除共产主义的影响，将为政府新劳工政策的特点。”日本劳动总同盟积极参加反动的反共运动，在国营铁路工人工会和几个其他工会中，组织法西斯的反共同盟，计划与执行谋刺日共总书记德田的，就是这个反共同盟。在产业工会联合会的支部里，社会党代理人组织秘密的阴谋。
    但是，日本工人阶级以坚决的统一的意志抗击了这个运动。搜捕与迫害日本共产党，并没有削弱它在劳动群众中的影响。芝浦电汽工人工会联合会表示大多数日本工人的信心，该会在一项决议中宣称：“事实上，只有共产党在为日本的独立与工人的真正利益而斗争。”在拥有会员十万人的电汽工人工会大会上，共产党员被选为执委会的主席与副主席。共产党员并被选入政府铁路工人工会的领导机关。工人阶级并非将自己局限于为自己经济利益的斗争中，它作为国内民主力量的先锋队而活动着。六月九日，为保持工人与农会的联系成立了联络委员会。有四十八个职工会参加了这个组织。日本劳动总同盟和右翼社会党抵制这个新组织，它们认为它的成立乃是达到日本人民民主统一战线的步骤。工人运动的高度分裂状态，一部分工人政治成熟不够，某些工会中坚持行会与改良主义的传统，以及日本政府与美国占领当局压迫性的反劳工政策，这些造成了严重阻碍职工运动进一步的成长与巩固，但这些阻碍正被成功地克服着。在战后三年中，日本工人阶级已经证明，它不仅可以为坚持其自己的利益而斗争，而县能领导广大劳动群众为消灭法西斯主义与军国主义的残余，为日本国家的独立及其真正民主的建立而斗争。
