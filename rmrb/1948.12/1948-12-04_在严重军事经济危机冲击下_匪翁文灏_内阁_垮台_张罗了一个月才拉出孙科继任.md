　　Under the Impact of a Severe Military and Economic Crisis,
  　Bandit Weng Wenhao's "Cabinet" Collapses
    Sun Ke is Pulled Out to Succeed Him After a Month of Wrangling
    【Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 2nd】The Kuomintang reactionary bandit gang's so-called first "Constitutional Cabinet" headed by Weng Wenhao, formed in May of this year under the auspices of the United States, has collapsed under the impact of a severe military and economic crisis. Weng Wenhao submitted his "resignation" to the bandit Chiang Kai-shek at the end of last month, but because everyone within the Nanjing ruling clique has seen the imminent final demise of their rule, no one dared to succeed Weng Wenhao. Bandit Chiang Kai-shek spent nearly a month wrangling, and finally decided to pull out Sun Ke. Sun Ke's first task upon taking office was to show his slavish nature as much as possible, ingratiating himself with his American masters and begging American imperialism for help. On November 27th, the day after announcing the "cabinet," he gave a shameless talk to a United Press reporter in Shanghai, saying that "most of his education was received at the University of California and Columbia University in the United States," to prove that he was qualified to be an American slave. He said, "Against this background, it is natural to guess that his government will reflect many of the fashions in the American viewpoint." Sun Ke made no secret of his intention to sell off China's sovereignty in large quantities in exchange for military assistance from American imperialism, saying that "his personal opinion is that China must make any reasonable concessions (meaning selling out China's sovereignty) to obtain a large amount of American military assistance as soon as possible." Sun Ke's remarks revealed that the Kuomintang government is prepared to further sell out China's inland river navigation rights and China's military sovereignty as part of the treasonous conditions for obtaining American aid. Sun Ke said that he "agrees to open the Yangtze River and other inland rivers to American ships and other foreign ships," and "under certain circumstances, allow the US Navy to use the inland rivers in the manner that US military advisers may desire." Sun Ke openly expressed the hope that the United States would send an American warlord like MacArthur to China as the Supreme Military Advisor to the Kuomintang government, with full power to preside over the Kuomintang's anti-people war.

　　在严重军事经济危机冲击下
  　匪翁文灏“内阁”垮台
    张罗了一个月才拉出孙科继任
    【新华社陕北二日电】国民党反动匪帮于今年五月在美国牵线下组成的以翁文灏为首的所谓第一届“行宪内阁”，在严重的军事、经济危机冲击下，已宣告垮台。翁文灏是上月底向蒋贼介石提出“辞呈”的，但由于南京统治集团内部每一个人都已看到其统治的最后覆灭迫在眉睫，无人敢继翁文灏的位子，蒋贼张罗了近一个月，最后才决定拉出孙科。孙科上台的第一件工作，就是尽量显出奴才本色，向其美国主人献媚，哀求美帝国主义救命。他于宣布“组阁”的第二天即十一月二十七日在上海向合众社记者发表无耻的谈话，说“他的教育大部分是在美国加州大学及哥伦比亚大学受的”，以此证明他够格作一个美国奴才。他说“在这种背景前面来猜测他的政府将会反映美国观点中的许多风尚乃是自然的”，孙科毫不遮掩他准备大量拍卖中国的主权去换得美帝国主义的军事援助的企图。说“他个人的意见是中国必须作任何有理由的让步（指出卖中国主权），以尽早获得大量的美国军事援助”。孙科的谈话泄露：国民党政府已准备进一步出卖中国的内河航权和中国的军事主权，作为换取美国援助的卖国条件之一部分。孙科说他“赞成对美国船及其他外国船开放长江及其他内河”，并“在某种情况下，允许美国海军按美军顾问们所可能希望的方式利用内河”。孙科公开提出希望美国派遣一个如麦克阿瑟样的美国军阀来华作为国民党政府的最高军事顾问，全权主持国民党的反人民战争。
