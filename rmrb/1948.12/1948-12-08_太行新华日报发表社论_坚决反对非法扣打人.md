Taixing Electric Dispatch: The Taixing Xinhua Daily recently published an editorial entitled "Resolutely Oppose Illegal Acts of Detaining and Beating People in the Conclusion of Land Reform." The editorial begins by stating: "In the midst of the comprehensive unfolding of the conclusion of the land reform movement, it has recently been discovered that in eight villages, phenomena of detaining and beating people have occurred. One district cadre even personally resorted to violence. The occurrence of such phenomena is intolerable and illegal." The editorial points out that these phenomena occur in two ways: "One is that during the rectification of peasant associations, a small number of village cadres and militiamen take advantage of the rectification to attack and exclude certain people, arbitrarily beating and detaining them under the pretext of past misdeeds or disruptive speech. The other occurs during democratic elections. For example, someone who nominated seven women candidates was detained, and another person who was nominated as a candidate but did not attend the election because he did not want to be elected was also detained." After seriously criticizing these errors, the editorial goes on to point out the reasons for their occurrence: "On the one hand, in the past, a few people resorted to coercion and commandism, acting arbitrarily without organization or discipline, violating the interests of the majority of the masses; on the other hand, there is the unresolved issue of sectarian divisions in the countryside. The vast majority of those detained and beaten in the aforementioned eight villages were former participants or leaders of spontaneous poor peasant leagues. This indicates that the antagonism between village cadres, party branches, and former poor peasant leagues has not been eliminated." Regarding the correct resolution of this sectarian division, the editorial points out: "It should be regarded as an internal problem of the peasants, and a policy of mutual self-criticism and correction of errors, eliminating antagonism and achieving unity, should be adopted. It should never be resolved by using one faction to oppose another, or even by resorting to illegal retaliation through detention and beatings. All these errors of district and village cadres must be strictly reviewed, and self-criticism must be made to the local masses, with appropriate punishments given according to the circumstances, in order to educate cadres, party members, and the masses." The editorial concludes by pointing out: "The occurrence of the above phenomena is by no means accidental and must be given serious attention by leading organs at all levels throughout the district. In order to correct and prevent the occurrence of this erroneous tendency, on the one hand, education on democracy and unity should be carried out from top to bottom in the conclusion of land reform, the rectification of cadres' ideological style should be implemented, the tendency of disorganization and indiscipline should be overcome, and in particular, district and village cadres should be helped to eliminate bad old work styles and establish new work styles of connecting with the masses and being democratic. On the other hand, in the conclusion of land reform, sectarian divisions in the countryside must be correctly resolved. This requires combining the work of party rectification with the conclusion of land reform, first unfolding criticism and self-criticism within the branch, exposing and overcoming sectarianism, and then, under the correct leadership of the branch, uniting the broad masses and the activists and better elements in the former poor peasant leagues, mutually reviewing and correcting errors, in order to achieve the goal of eliminating sectarianism and achieving unity."

　　太行新华日报发表社论
  　坚决反对非法扣打人
    【太行电】此间新华日报顷以“在结束土改中坚决反对扣人打人的非法行为”为题发表社论，首称：“在结束土改运动全面开展当中，近来发现八个村庄发生扣人打人现象，一个区干部竟亲自动手打人。这种现象的发生是令人不能容忍的，是犯法的。”这种现象的发生，社论指出：“一种是在整顿农会时，有少数村干部民兵借整顿农会，打击排斥一部分人，借口他们过去有劣迹，说破坏话，就任意加以殴打扣押。一种是在民主选举时发生的，例如一个人提了七个妇女候选人，就被扣起来，还有一个人被提为候选人，但因自己不愿当选，选举时未到场，也被扣起来。”社论严肃的批评了这种错误后，继指出错误发生的原因：一方面由于过去少数人强迫命令，无组织无纪律任意妄为，违反多数群众的利益；一方面还由于农村中的宗派对立，未能正确的解决。上述八个村被扣打的，绝大多数是过去曾经参加过自发的贫农团或是贫农团的负责人。这说明村干部、党的支部和过去贫农团的对立均未消除。”对于正确解决这种宗派对立，社论指出：“应当是当作农民内部问题看待，应该是采取互相检讨改正错误，消除对立达到团结的方针，而绝不应当采取以宗派反对宗派，甚至以扣打方式进行非法报复。所有这些区村干部的错误，都必须严格检讨，向当地群众作自我批评，并分别情况给以适当处分，以达到教育干部党员与群众的目的。”社论最后指出：“上述现象的发生，绝不是偶然的，必须引起全区各级领导机关的严重注意。为了纠正与防止这种错误倾向的发生，一方面在结束土改中应自上而下的进行民主与团结的教育，贯彻干部思想作风的整顿，克服无组织无纪律的倾向，特别要帮助区村干部去掉不良的旧作风，树立联系群众的民主的新作风。另一方面在结束土改中，必须正确的解决农村中的宗派对立，这就必须在结束土改中，结合整党工作，首先在支部内展开批评与自我批评，揭发宗派克服宗派，然后在支部正确领导下团结广大群众及以前贫农团中的积极分子与较好分子，互相检讨改正错误，达到消除宗派、团结一致的目的。”
