　　Ji-Lu-Yu Vigorously Mobilizes the Masses to Produce Saltpeter
　　Universally Establishes County Nitrate and Sulfur Bureaus
　　[Ji-Lu-Yu Electric] The Ji-Lu-Yu District Nitrate and Sulfur Management Bureau, in order to expand saltpeter production, has specially added county bureaus, strengthened leadership, enriched cadres, vigorously mobilized the masses to produce saltpeter, improved technology, and improved quality, gradually developing from decentralized individual production to relatively concentrated workshop production and mutual aid production. In the past, the bureau was not independently established, but was only a department organization under the Industry and Commerce Bureau. It often relaxed its own business due to the central work of the Industry and Commerce Bureau, so that the annual purchase task from October last year to September this year was only 35 percent completed. In May of this year, the bureau was transferred from the leadership of the Industry and Commerce Bureau to an independent agency directly under the Administrative Office, and county bureaus were established in Puyang and other seven counties. Now, with the stability of the situation in the Henan area, and the task requirements of the bureau, according to the Administrative Office's decision to "establish county bureaus in all nitrate-producing counties," in mid-December, seven county bureaus will be added in the Hebei area, including Chiping and Changyuan, and fourteen county bureaus will be added in the Henan area, including Shan County and Heze, as well as two offices in the third and fifth sub-districts. To strengthen leadership, the county bureaus have been changed to bureaus directly under the county government, under the direct leadership of the county magistrate; the head of the Construction Section no longer concurrently serves as the director of the bureau. The offices are administratively under the leadership of the Construction Section of the Special Commissioner's Office, and business-wise directly under the leadership of the District Bureau.
　　At present, there are several major problems in the nitrate and sulfur management work in the Ji-Lu-Yu area: First, the issue of mobilizing and organizing nitrate workers. At present, the main task is popularization, because a large amount of nitrate soil in the entire area is not being processed, and it is necessary to vigorously mobilize the masses to learn saltpeter production technology and engage in this production. Second, the issue of improving technology and improving quality. The quality standard of saltpeter is fixed. If the quality does not meet the standard and needs to be re-boiled, it will result in a waste of manpower and materials. Over the past year or more, the quality of saltpeter has improved greatly. The quality of the third-class saltpeter that the Nitrate and Sulfur Bureau does not want is now close to the so-called good saltpeter in June last year, but the conservative thinking that still exists among most old nitrate workers must be further overcome. In the future, we should encourage the invention and creation of nitrate workers, and persuade the old nitrate workers to take more apprentices and spread their technical experience. In the future, we must emphasize that technical work is an important part of all nitrate and sulfur work, so that all cadres can universally learn technology. Third, the issue of nitrate prices should be appropriately increased as prices rise. In addition, it is necessary to strengthen the education of nitrate workers. Now is the season for making nitrate, and the nitrate and sulfur bureaus in various places are working to expand production areas, improve quality, and increase production, with the overall goal of achieving a quality of 80 percent pure nitrate for first-class nitrate and 70 percent for second-class nitrate by the end of the year, as well as a purchase task of 500,000 catties.

　　冀鲁豫大力发动群众熬硝
  　普设县硝磺局
    【冀鲁豫电】冀鲁豫区硝磺管理局为扩大火硝生产，特增设县局，加强领导充实干部，大力发动群众熬硝，改进技术提高质量，由分散的个体生产，逐渐向比较集中的作坊生产与互助生产发展。该局过去无独立设置，而仅属工商局之部门组织，时常为工商局之中心工作放松了本身业务，以致去年十月至今年九月的全年收买任务，只完成到百分之三十五。今年五月，该局始由工商局领导下转为行署直接领导的独立机构，开始在濮阳等七县设立了县局。兹以河南地区形势稳定，以及该局任务要求，特根据行署“产硝县份普设县局”的决定，于本月中旬又在河北地区增设茌平、长垣等七个县局，在河南地区增设单县、菏泽等十四个县局及三、五分区两个办事处。为加强领导，县局改为县府直属局，受县长直接领导；建设科长不兼局长职务。办事处则确定行政上受专署建设科领导，业务上受区局直接领导。
    目前冀鲁豫区的硝磺管理工作中有以下几个较大问题：第一是硝工发动组织问题，目前主要的是普及，因全区尚有广大硝土无人熬制，须大力发动群众学习熬硝技术，从事这一生产。第二是改进技术提高质量问题，火硝的质量标准是一定的，如质量不够标准须重熬时，就形成人力物力的浪费。一年多来，火硝质量提高已有很大成绩，目前硝磺局不要的三等硝，质量已将及去年六月时的所谓好硝，但多数旧硝工仍然存在的保守思想，必须进一步克服。今后应提倡硝工的发明创造，并说服老硝工多收徒弟，传播其技术经验。今后必须强调技术工作是全部硝磺工作的重要一环，使所有干部普遍进行技术学习。第三是硝价问题，应随物价上涨作适当提高。此外并须加强硝工教育。现在已是制硝季节，各地硝磺局正在扩大产区、提高质量、增加产额的总目标下，为年底达到头等硝含纯硝百分之八十、二等含百分之七十的质量以及五十万斤的收买任务而展开工作。
