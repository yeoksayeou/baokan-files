　　International Reactionaries Undermine Peace, Encountering Opposition from the Broad Masses of People Worldwide
　　While the world's progressive people strongly demand democracy and peace, and demand direct negotiations between the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France to resolve the Berlin issue, the international reactionaries, led by the reactionary US government, continue their dark conspiracy to undermine peace and divide Germany. American imperialists are currently stepping up their efforts to instigate the so-called "North Atlantic Alliance," planning to first have the United States, Canada, Britain, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg conclude a "North Atlantic Treaty of Collective Defense," and then draw other Western European countries to participate. This "alliance" instigated by American imperialists, under the guise of "defending against aggression," is in reality "preparing for war diplomatically" (Labor Daily). At the same time, the American and British occupation governors of West Germany illegally concluded an agreement on November 9, once again violating the four-power decision to jointly handle the German issue, and announced the return of the Ruhr, the center of German heavy industry, to German monopoly capitalists. This is another step by the American and British reactionaries to foster the revival of Nazi aggressive forces. In addition, the United States and Britain ordered their lackeys, the splinter faction of the Berlin City Council, to hold a sham city election in the West Berlin area on December 5, with the aim of "establishing a split city council and municipal government in West Berlin to replace the unified city council and municipal government, and then dividing the complete Berlin into two independent regions, east and west" (Berlin Democratic League). These measures taken by American imperialists to endanger international peace are based on a very fragile foundation. These measures have aroused the anger and opposition of the broad masses of people around the world. The National Council of American-Soviet Friendship will host a "Struggle for Peace Conference" in New York on December 13 to express the desire of the American people to establish lasting world peace. The French Communist Party issued a statement on November 23 opposing the return of the Ruhr to Nazi financial groups, once again calling for the organization of a democratic coalition government, and reaffirming the guarantee that the French people would never fight against the Soviet Union. The French General Confederation of Labor and the German People's Council also issued protest statements at the end of last month regarding the US-British Ruhr decision. Recently, German democratic parties and groups have launched a mass movement to resist the American attempt to dismember Berlin through a sham election. The German People's Council issued a telegram on November 27 calling on the citizens of Berlin to "not agree to this election!" "Do not participate in the splinter faction's election!" The American aggression plan is not only opposed by the people of Europe, but has also aroused haggling and disputes between the American reactionaries and their European lackeys. The planned "North Atlantic Alliance" is not progressing very smoothly. After the signing of the US-British Ruhr Agreement, the reactionary French government, intimidated by popular pressure and because their own interests had suffered too much damage, had to protest to the US and British governments and declare that it did not recognize the agreement.

　　国际反动派破坏和平遭世界广大人民反对
    当世界进步人民强烈要求民主和平，要求苏美英法四国直接谈判以解决柏林问题的时候，以美国反动政府为首的国际反动派，继续进行其破坏和平和分裂德国的黑暗勾当，美帝国主义者近正加紧策动所谓“北大西洋联盟”，拟先由美、加、英、法、荷、比、卢七国缔结“北大西洋联防公约”，然后再拉西欧其他国家参加。美帝国主义者指使下的这一“联盟”，以“防御侵略”为名，行其“从外交上作战争准备”（劳动报）之实。同时，西德美英两国占领军总督于十一月九日非法订立协定，再次违反四强共同处理德国问题决定，宣布将德国重工业中心鲁尔交还德国独占资本家。这是美英反动派扶植纳粹侵略势力复活的又一步骤。此外，美英又命令其喽罗柏林市议会分裂派，于十二月五日在西柏林地区举行伪市选，目的在于“建立西柏林分裂的市议会和市政府，以代替统一的市议会和市政府，进而将完整的柏林割裂为东西两个独立地区”（柏林民主同盟）。美帝国主义者这些危害国际和平的措施，其基础是非常脆弱的。这些措施已激起世界广大人民的愤怒和反对。美苏友谊协会全国委员会将于十二月十三日在纽约主持一“争取和平大会”，以表现美国人民建立全世界持久和平的意愿。法共于十一月二十三日发表声明，反对将鲁尔交还纳粹财阀，再次号召组织民主联合政府，并重申法国人民决不去对苏作战的保证。法国总工会、德国人民委员会亦于上月底分别发表对美英鲁尔决定的抗议声明。最近，德国民主党派团体已发起群众性的运动，以抵制美国肢解柏林的伪选企图，德国人民委员会十一月二十七日通电号召柏林市民“不要同意这一选举！”“不要参加分裂派的选举！”美国的侵略计划不但受到欧洲人民的反对，而且也引起了美国反动派与其欧洲走狗们的讨价还价的争吵。计划中的“北大西洋联盟”进展得并不很顺利。法国反动政府在美英鲁尔协定签订后，慑于人民的压力，亦因他们自身的利益遭受损害太大，不得不向美英政府提出抗议，宣布不承认这一协定。
