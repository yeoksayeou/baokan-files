　　Several Common Infectious Diseases in Winter
    Wang Gang
    (1) Common Cold: Commonly known as a cold, it is transmitted through the respiratory tract by a filterable virus. The main symptoms are upper respiratory tract inflammation (rhinitis, pharyngitis, tracheitis), runny nose, nasal congestion, sneezing, sore throat, cough, headache, back pain, and joint pain. Body temperature rises slightly. Severely ill patients have high fever and weakness, loss of appetite, and weakness in the limbs. It heals naturally after a few days. Diagnosis: Should be based on general symptoms and the presence of a large number of simultaneous cases. Be careful to distinguish it from typhoid fever, diphtheria, measles, and scarlet fever. Influenza is very similar to this disease, but influenza symptoms are more severe and prone to pneumonia. Treatment: Bed rest, liquid diet, bowel movements, drinking plenty of water, taking aspirin or sodium salicylate orally to induce sweating, or using ginger soup and pepper to induce sweating. Use Tuo's powder for cough, gargle for sore throat, and ephedrine nasal drops for rhinitis. Prevention: Patients should be isolated or wear their own masks and not cough at others. Healthy people should also wear masks and avoid close contact with patients.
    (2) Influenza: Caused by a filterable virus, transmitted through respiration, and mostly prevalent in winter and spring. The symptoms are similar to those of common colds, but the fever is very high, lasting up to two weeks, and all symptoms are more severe than common colds. The symptoms are complex and can be divided into three types: 1. Respiratory system type: Upper respiratory tract inflammation similar to the common cold; 2. Nervous system type: No upper respiratory tract inflammation symptoms, high fever and meningeal irritation symptoms; 3. Gastrointestinal system type: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, jaundice, and other gastrointestinal symptoms. Diagnosis: Diagnosis is not difficult during an epidemic. It should be distinguished from typhoid fever. Typhoid fever has rashes, and the disease gradually worsens at the beginning. Influenza often occurs suddenly in healthy people. Treatment: There is no specific treatment method, only symptomatic treatment. Bed rest, liquid diet, and drinking plenty of water are recommended. Prevention: Patients should be isolated, and those in close contact with patients should wear masks.
    (3) Typhoid Fever: Also known as enteric fever, it is caused by a typhoid bacillus that contaminates drinking water and food through flies and enters the digestive tract. The main symptoms are persistent and stubborn high fever. At the beginning, there is a feeling of cold, fatigue, loss of appetite, and the disease gradually worsens. The body temperature gradually rises, with bloating, constipation, or diarrhea. Red rashes appear in about seven or eight days, the body temperature remains at 40 degrees Celsius, loss of appetite, yellow coating on the tongue, chapped lips, delirium, headache, and cough. After seven or eight days, the body temperature is slightly lower in the morning but still high in the afternoon. During this period, intestinal bleeding or perforation is likely to occur, so special attention should be paid to diet. After seven or eight days, the body temperature drops. At this time, the patient is skinny and extremely weak. Recovery takes about two months. Diagnosis: Based on the gradually worsening condition, persistent high fever, rash appearing after seven or eight days, and particularly obvious digestive symptoms, a diagnosis can be made. It should be distinguished from influenza. Treatment: There is no specific medicine. The most important thing is nursing care. The patient should rest quietly in bed, eat liquid food, drink plenty of water, isolate the patient, and handle the patient's excrement.
    Paratyphoid fever symptoms are similar to typhoid fever, but all symptoms are milder.
    (4) Lobar Pneumonia: Mainly an infectious disease caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae. Sudden onset, chills and shivering, body temperature rises rapidly to 40 degrees Celsius or higher. At the same time, chest pain, cough, difficulty breathing. The amount of sputum is not much, but it is light red or rust-colored. The tongue has a thick coating, the lips have herpes, and the body temperature remains high without receding. Severe cases develop delirium and high degree of dyspnea. The white blood cell count increases, reaching 15,000 to 40,000. Diagnosis: Based on persistent high fever, chest pain, cough, rust-colored sputum, and physical symptoms, a diagnosis can be made. Treatment: After the diagnosis is confirmed, sulfonamides should be taken orally or injected immediately, one gram every four hours. Sulfadiazine, sulfamethoxazole, and sulfadimethoxine are the most effective. Ordinary sulfonamides and sulfaguanidine are ineffective. Penicillin is effective. Other treatments follow the nursing methods for febrile diseases.

　　冬季流行的几种传染病
    王  钢
    （一）普通感冒：俗名伤风，由一种滤过性病毒经气道互相传染。症状主要为上气道炎症（鼻炎、咽喉炎、气管炎），流涕、鼻闭塞、喷嚏、咽喉疼痛、咳嗽、头疼、背痛、关节痛。体温均轻度上升，重病者有发高热及衰弱现象，食欲减退，四肢无力。经过数日自然痊愈。诊断：应根据一般症状，及同时有多数流行。并注意和伤寒、白喉、麻疹、猩红热区别开。流行性感冒和本病极相似，不过流行性感冒症状较重易发肺炎。治疗：应卧床休息，吃流质饮食，通利大便，多喝水，用阿斯披林或柳酸钠内服发汗，或用姜汤胡椒等发汗。咳嗽用佗氏散，咽头痛用含嗽药，鼻炎用麻黄素滴鼻。预防法：病人应隔离或自带口罩不可对人咳嗽。健康人亦应带口罩，避免和病人接近。
    （二）流行性感冒：为一种滤过性病毒所引起，由呼吸传染，多流行于冬春两季。症状和普遍感冒类似，惟发热甚高。持续达两周，各种症状均较普遍感冒为重。其症状较复杂，可分为三型：一、呼吸系统型：发生上气道炎与普通感冒相似；二、神经系统型；无上气道炎症状，有高热及脑膜刺戟症状；三、胃肠系统型：有恶心呕吐、下痢、黄疸等肠胃症状。诊断：流行时诊断不难，应和肠伤寒区别，伤寒有发疹，初起时病势逐渐加重。流行性感冒多由健康人突然发病。治疗：无特效治疗法，只有对症治疗，应卧床休息，吃流动食，多喝水。预防法应隔离病人，接近病人者戴口罩。
    （三）伤寒：又名肠热症，系由一种伤寒杆菌由苍蝇污染之，饮水及食物同时侵入消化管引起疾病。主要症状为持续顽固的发高热，初起感觉寒冷，疲倦，食欲减退，病势由轻渐重，体温逐渐上升，鼓肠便秘或下痢。大约七八天就发红疹，体温到四十度稽留不退，不思饮食，舌披黄苔，口唇焦黑，病人说谵语头痛咳嗽，经过七八天后，体温上午稍低下午仍高，此期容易肠出血或穿孔故应特别注意饮食，经过七八天体温下降，此时病人已骨瘦如柴，衰弱过甚。经过约两月，始能恢复。诊断：根据病势日渐加重，顽固的发高热，七八天出诊消化器症状特别明显，可以诊断。应和流行性感冒区别。治疗：无特效药，最重要者为护理工作，应使病人安静卧床休息，吃流质食物，多喝水，隔离病人，处理病人大小便。
    副伤寒症状和伤寒类似，惟各种症状均轻。
    （四）大叶性肺炎：主要是由肺炎双球菌所引起的传染病。突然发病，恶寒战栗，体温急升至四十度或更高。同时胸疼，咳嗽，呼吸困难。痰量虽不多，然为淡红色或铁锈色。舌有厚苔，口唇有匍行疹，体温停留在高度而不退，重症者发谵语高度呼吸困难。本病有的并发脓胸及干湿性肋膜炎。白血球增多可达一万五千至四万。诊断：根据高热稽留不退，胸痛、咳嗽、铁锈色痰、理学症状，可以诊断。治疗法：诊断确定后，应立刻用磺胺内服或注射，每四小时服一公分。以磺胺吡定，磺胺唑，磺胺代精最有效。普通磺胺及磺胺呱则无效。潘尼西林有特效。其他按热性病护理法。
