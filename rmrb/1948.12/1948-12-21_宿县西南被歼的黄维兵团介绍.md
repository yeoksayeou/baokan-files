Xinhua News Agency, Frontlines of Huaihai, 17th. The Kuomintang army Huang Wei 12th Corps, completely annihilated this time in the Shuangduiji area southwest of Su County, comprised approximately 120,000 men, including direct subordinate units, four armies, eleven divisions, and one rapid column. The designations of the four armies and eleven divisions are as follows: 18th Army, comprising the 11th Division, 118th Division, and 49th Division; 85th Army, comprising the 23rd Division, 110th Division, and 216th Division; 10th Army, comprising the 18th Division, 75th Division, and 114th Division; 14th Army, comprising the 10th Division and 85th Division. The above eleven divisions comprised a total of thirty-one regiments. The one rapid column was the 4th Rapid Column. Of these, except for two regiments of the 110th Division of the 85th Army, who revolted under the leadership of General Liao Yunzhou, and the remnants of two regiments of the 23rd Division of that army and the army's direct field artillery battalion, who surrendered under the leadership of the 23rd Division Commander Huang Zihua, the rest were completely annihilated. The entire Huang Wei Corps was composed of Chiang Kai-shek's direct line troops: the 18th Army was originally the 11th Reorganized Division, whose commander was Hu Lien. This army was originally the unit with which Chen Cheng made his name, and it was fully equipped with American weaponry in March 1945. The 85th Army was originally a part of Tang Enbo's forces, expanded from Tang's 110th Division during the War of Resistance Against Japan. In the War of Liberation, this army had not been subjected to annihilating blows because it had not had much contact with the People's Liberation Army, but this time it was finally completely annihilated. The 10th Army was the original 3rd Reorganized Division, the old unit of Li Xianzhou, and it had been completely annihilated twice by the People's Liberation Army, in September 1946 and December 1947. The 14th Army was the original 10th Reorganized Division, the old unit of Wei Lihuang, and it served as the Chongqing garrison in 1941.

　　宿县西南被歼的黄维兵团介绍
    【新华社淮海前线十七日电】此次在宿县西南双堆集地区全部被歼的国民党军黄维第十二兵团，除直属队外，共辖四个军，十一个师及一个快速纵队，共约十二万人。四个军与十一个师的番号如下：十八军，辖十一师、一一八师、四十九师；八十五军，辖二十三师、一一零师、二一六师；十军，辖十八师、七十五师、一一四师；十四军，辖十师、八十五师。以上十一个师共辖三十一个团。一个快速纵队为第四快速纵队。其中除八十五军一一零师两个团在师长廖运周将军率领下起义，该军二十三师两个团残部及军直野炮营由二十三师师长黄子华率领投降外，其余全部被歼。黄维兵团全部为蒋贼嫡系部队：十八军原为整十一师，师长为胡琏。该军原为陈诚起家的部队，在一九四五年三月全部装备美械。八十五军原为汤恩伯部，抗日战争中以汤部一一零师为基础，扩编而成。在解放战争中，该军因未与解放军多接触，故尚未受到歼灭性打击，此次终遭全歼。十军为原整三师，系李仙洲旧部，在一九四六年九月及一九四七年十二月曾被解放军两次全歼。十四军为原整十师，系卫立煌旧部，一九四一年曾担任重庆卫戍部队。
