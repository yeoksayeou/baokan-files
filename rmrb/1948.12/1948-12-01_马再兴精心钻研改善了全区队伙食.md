Comrade Ma Zaixing is the director of the supply department of a certain district team. He has consistently been proactive and responsible in his work. Not afraid of hardship, he diligently researched and created new methods to improve the food for the entire district team. Therefore, in this merit evaluation, he was unanimously awarded a first-class merit.

I. Diligent research and overcoming difficulties in work. For example, during the last troop reception, from April 2nd to May 25th, the entire district team lost 27,500 jin of millet. He was determined to fight for these 27,500 jin of millet, personally going to each company to find the quartermasters and cooks to research the matter. As a result, he saved a large amount in a very short period of time.

First, he convened a meeting of quartermasters and administrative leaders to study and review the reasons for the loss. At that time, most company-level cadres and quartermaster cadres only thought that the soldiers had big appetites and ate a lot, and there was no way to solve it, so they had to ask the superiors to write it off. However, under the patient guidance of Comrade Ma Zaixing, they reviewed the objective reasons (such as the waste of rice during carrying and cooking, as well as the erroneous thinking of valuing money over grain). They also researched and developed techniques to change how rice was cooked. For example, in the past, more dry rice was cooked and less thin porridge was made. The dry rice was eaten up and the thin porridge was drunk. However, after the meeting and research, they cooked more thin porridge and less dry rice. As a result, everyone ate their fill and ate well, and the soldiers were very willing to eat this way. As a result, millet was saved day by day.

II. Personally starting, making a breakthrough, absorbing experience, and promoting the overall situation. He once served as quartermaster in the 10th Company (which at that time was the company with the most lost rice), and worked with the company's quartermaster to research using lard instead of peanut oil. First, they combined the price of the two pigs in his company, slaughtered them for meat and oil. After experimenting for two weeks, they saved millet and didn't lose any. Within a month, they completely made up for the more than 2,530 jin of millet the entire company had lost.

In order to make up for the more than 27,500 jin of millet, and at the same time find experience, he advocated eating pork and more lard instead of peanut oil throughout the regiment. In order to make it convenient for everyone to eat meat and oil, he also organized a pig-slaughtering cooperative to ensure that soldiers ate one to two liang of meat per person every day, and it was also cheaper than the market price. For example, at the beginning, the market price was 9,000 yuan per jin, while the supply department's price was 6,000 yuan per jin. Later, prices increased, the market price rose to 10,000 yuan per jin, and the supply department's price was 7,500 yuan per jin. As prices continued to rise, the market price rose to 15,000 yuan per jin, and the supply department's price was 8,500 yuan per jin. During this period (from June to the end of September), nearly 100 pigs were slaughtered, totaling 15,000 jin of meat. According to the market price of 11,333 yuan per jin on average, but the supply department's price was 7,333 yuan per jin on average. Therefore, the average price of this meat was 4,000 yuan cheaper per jin than the market price, saving a total of 60 million yuan.

Due to the above methods, and converting the saved money into rice, not only was the 27,500 jin of millet completely made up, but there was also a surplus.

III. Going deep into the grassroots and providing specific guidance. He saw that the 8th Company's pot was well-fired, saving from one jin of charcoal per person per day to half a jin. He mixed the charcoal dust well and burned it, and asked the quartermasters of each company to visit and improve. Furthermore, he urged the quartermasters to go to distant places to buy vegetables, saving vegetable money and also getting vegetables to eat.

IV. Simple style and good spirit of enduring hardship. For a period of time, he personally dug manure with the communicators and keepers, and also got up early to dig toilets, carry manure, and grow vegetables, playing a leading role in production by setting an example.

　　马再兴精心钻研改善了全区队伙食
    马再兴同志是某区队供给处主任，在工作中一贯的积极负责，不怕吃苦自己精心钻研创造了新的方法，改善了全区队的伙食，因此在这次评功当中全体通过立了一功。
    一、对工作精心钻研，克服困难。如在上次接兵时，自四月二号，到五月二十五日止，全区队亏小米二万七千五百斤，他就下定决心要为这二万七千五百斤小米奋斗，亲自到各连找司务长上士伙房研究，结果在很短的时间内即大量节余了。
    首先，召开了司务人员及行政首长的会议，研究检讨亏的原因，当时绝大部分连队干部司务干部，光认为战士肚大吃的多，没有办法，只好请上级报销，但是在马再兴同志的耐心掌握下，检讨了客观的原因（如背米作饭淘米等浪费现象，同时还存在着轻粮秣重金钱的错误思想），并研究出改变作饭的技术，如过去作干饭多稀粥少，干饭吃光稀粥喝了，但经开会研究以后，多作稀粥少作干饭，结果大家吃的饱还吃的好，战士们还很愿意这样吃，结果小米逐日节省。
    二、自己亲自下手，突破一点，吸取经验，推动全盘。他曾到十连当事务长（当时十连是亏米最多的一个连），与该连司务长共同研究，不用花生油吃猪油，首先把他连的两个猪合成价钱，杀了吃肉耗油，试验了二个礼拜，就节省了小米不亏了，到一个月的时间，即把全连亏的二千五百三十余斤小米完全补上了。　　为了弥补二万七千五百多斤小米，同时又找到了经验，在全团提倡吃猪肉，多吃猪油不吃花生油，为了使大家吃肉吃油方便，又组织了杀猪合作社，保证战士每天每人吃上一两到二两肉，并且还比市价便宜。如开始时市价每斤九千元，供给处每斤六千元，以后物价提高了，市价每斤涨到一万元，供给处每斤七千五百元，物价继续提高，市价涨到一万五千元，供给处每斤八千五百元，这一段落（六月起到九月中止）共杀将近一百口。合肉一万五千斤，按市价每斤平均一万一千三百三十三元，但供给处每斤平均七千三百三十三元，因此按这肉平均价目比市价每斤贱四千元，总合起来共节省六千万元。
    由于以上的方法，及把节省的钱折成米，完全补上二万七千五百斤小米还有余。
    三、深入下层，具体指导。他见到八连盘的锅火正好，由每人每天一斤炭节省到半斤，把炭面弄出来混合好炭烧，就叫各连司务长去参观改进。再如督促司务长们到远处去买菜，节省了菜金，也吃上了菜。
    四、作风朴素，吃苦耐劳精神好。有一时期亲自与通讯员司养员在一块挖粪，同时又早起挖厕所，挑屎，种菜，在生产上起了以身作则的带动作用。
