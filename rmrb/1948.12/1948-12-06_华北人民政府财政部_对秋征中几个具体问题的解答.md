  　Answers to Specific Questions Regarding the Autumn Grain Collection
    Question: Should tax exemption points be deducted for revolutionary staff on a salary system?
    Answer: For staff in enterprises, if they are on a supply system, a tax exemption point should be deducted at their home. If they are on a salary or bonus system, no tax exemption point should be deducted. However, if the salary is very low and comparable to a supply system, that is a contracted supply system, then a tax exemption point should also be deducted at home.
    How should tax exemption points be deducted for hired laborers?
    Question: Article 9, Item C of the tax regulations stipulates that tax exemption points should be deducted at the employer's home for hired laborers who eat at the employer's home. But what if they don't eat at the employer's home, and the wages paid also include food expenses? Should tax exemption points still be deducted at the employer's home? If not, wouldn't the employer be at a disadvantage? Should a certain tax exemption point be deducted for all hired laborers, regardless of whether they are provided with meals or on a lump-sum contract?
    Answer: The tax exemption points for hired laborers should be calculated and deducted based on the time they spend eating at the employer's home and at their own home. For lump-sum contract laborers, although the wages include a portion for food expenses, the time is generally short, and it is also different from hiring laborers. The employer doesn't need to plan work for contract laborers, nor does it need to spend time cooking, which provides a great benefit to the employer. Therefore, no tax exemption points should be deducted at the employer's home.
    Retired veterans should not be exempt from burdens
    Question: Should foreign honorary veterans who have recently settled down receive preferential treatment regarding burdens? If they genuinely lack labor power, have difficulty making a living, and are unable to bear the burden, would it be appropriate to deduct an extra half tax exemption point with government approval? Also, what if some use the "three-year exemption from burdens" provision noted on their honorary certificate as an excuse to avoid the burden?
　　　　(Liu Qingwu)
    Answer: Foreign honorary veterans who have recently settled down should be treated the same as the masses regarding burdens and should not receive special treatment. However, if they lack labor power, have difficulty making a living, and are genuinely unable to bear the burden, they can be temporarily exempted from the burden with the approval of the county government. As for those who use the "three-year exemption from burdens" provision noted on their honorary certificate as an excuse to avoid the burden, a cordial attitude should be adopted to persuade and mobilize them, explaining that the three-year exemption from burdens is not a unified government regulation and that they should act in accordance with the new agricultural tax regulations issued by the North China People's Government.
    How much consumption should be deducted for livestock?
    Question: Has the North China People's Government promulgated the new agricultural tax burden method? (We haven't seen it yet.) When deducting consumption, how much should be deducted for oxen, donkeys, mules, and horses? The article "What is a Proportional Tax?" in the People's Daily, issue 131, states: "Oxen and donkeys, four shi of grain; mules and horses, seven shi of grain." However, I remember that it was said during the transmission of the autumn harvest and wheat planting work in Zhao County: "Mules and horses deduct ten shi of grain, oxen and donkeys deduct seven shi of grain." This is still being promoted now. Because we haven't seen the new burden method, we are unclear about this matter. Please provide an answer.
　　(Jizhong Daobao News Agency, Hui Sheng)
    Answer: The new agricultural tax regulations are currently under review and have not been formally promulgated. Regarding the deduction of consumption for livestock, the initial draft of the tax regulations stipulated ten shi of grain for mules and horses and seven shi of grain for oxen and donkeys. The county transmitted the information based on the original regulations. Later, after research, it was determined that the original regulations were too disadvantageous for households without livestock. Therefore, it was changed to seven shi of grain for mules and horses and four shi of grain for oxen and donkeys. The report was published based on the revised regulations, so there is a difference between the two. All localities should implement the regulations based on what is published in the newspaper.
    Is it appropriate to calculate labor force by household?
    Question: We have some doubts about the calculation of labor force for agricultural tax: Calculating the labor force not by person but by household inevitably results in some being at a disadvantage and others benefiting. For example, if two households both have five people, but household A has five people with labor power, while household B has only one person with labor power, according to the regulations, both households are considered to have labor power. Wouldn't household B be at a disadvantage? (Huolu Fourth Elementary School, Bingru, Yaodong)
    Answer: Regarding the calculation of labor force for agricultural tax, you feel that calculating by household, with uneven labor force distribution, results in some being at a disadvantage and others benefiting. In reality, the amount of labor force has little impact on agricultural tax. Only individual poor people without labor power who have difficulty making a living, as well as military families, martyrs' families, and widowed and orphaned households, can deduct an extra half tax exemption point per person. Your feeling that households with more labor power benefit is based on the idea that they produce more than households with less labor power and should bear more of the burden. This is incorrect. What is being levied is agricultural tax, and the main target is land income, which cannot include everything. For example, the current labor burden for war support and substitute farming targets the labor force, and households with more labor power bear more of the burden. Therefore, agricultural tax and the amount of labor force cannot be mixed together in agricultural tax. It is necessary to separate who benefits and who is at a disadvantage.
    How should beekeeping households bear the burden?
    Question: There is a beekeeping household in the urban area with seven or eight people, raising a total of thirty or forty beehives, and also having a spinning machine that is frequently used for spinning. The main source of income for the household is beekeeping and spinning. They only have three to five mu of land, which they don't cultivate themselves but rent out. In the past, their beekeeping and spinning were considered side occupations. The household has little land and many people, not meeting the threshold for tax payment, so they have never borne any tax. In reality, their living standard is very high. Should such households pay taxes? (Xingtang, Chen Ying)
    Answer: First, it should be determined that this household's beekeeping and spinning are not side occupations, because the main source of income for this household is beekeeping and spinning, and they only have three to five mu of land which is rented out. Therefore, the issue of whether or not to levy taxes on side occupations should not be debated. According to Article 2 of the new tax regulations, "Those who cultivate or hire others to cultivate land, as well as those who rent out land, have the obligation to pay agricultural tax in accordance with these tax regulations." This household does not engage in agricultural operations, nor does it mainly rely on agricultural production for its livelihood. Therefore, the population tax exemption points should not be deducted, and all of their land should bear the burden. As for the income from beekeeping and spinning, the burden or non-burden and how to burden should be determined according to the industrial and commercial burden methods and should not be mixed with agricultural tax.
    For semi-agricultural and semi-commercial households in small cities, agricultural tax should be levied on the land, and tax exemption points should be deducted based on the population participating in agricultural operations and mainly relying on agricultural production for their livelihood. The industrial and commercial income portion can be burdened according to the industrial and commercial burden methods.
    Rental income should also bear the burden
    Question: Should rental income bear the burden? I believe that today's rents are generally not high, and repair costs are very large. In order to quickly restore and develop urban construction, it may be temporarily exempt from the burden. Is this appropriate?
　(Liu Qingwu)
    Answer: Rental income is a large income in the city, and there are even those who rely solely on this income to maintain their livelihood. Your opinion is that rents are generally not high now, and repair costs are very large during the war, so they can be temporarily exempted from the burden in order to quickly restore and develop urban construction. This certainly encourages housing construction, but it should not be considered from only one aspect, because the expenditure for the front-line war and rear-area construction is very large, and the burdens of agriculture, industry, and commerce are quite heavy. In order to completely defeat Chiang Kai-shek and strive for an early victory in the war, the burden surface should be expanded so that people from all walks of life contribute their efforts. Therefore, rental income should also share some of the burden. This does not mean that housing construction is not rewarded, because rewarding does not equal not bearing the burden. The government provides care for rental income in terms of the burden.
    Can taxes be reduced for fruit trees and mountain goods in case of poor harvests?
    Question: Calculating the burden of fruit trees and mountain goods based on the normal annual yield and converting it into grain at 60% of the local market price is relatively fixed and easy to calculate. However, the income from fruit trees and mountain goods is different from agricultural crops. If there is a poor harvest, some have no income at all. If they are made to bear the burden, they really can't afford it. Can the burden be calculated at 60% in general years, and taxes reduced or exempted with government approval in years without harvest?
    Answer: The new agricultural tax regulations stipulate that fruit trees and mountain goods are assessed based on the average annual yield and converted into grain at 50% of the general market price during the main harvest and sales seasons in the local area (the initial draft stipulated 60%, but after research, it was changed to 50% for consideration). The so-called average annual yield takes into account bumper harvests, poor harvests, hanging branches, and resting branches, and sets production based on its average. This is already a layered consideration. The year of no harvest that you mentioned has already been taken into account when setting production, so you should not ask for a reduction or exemption from the burden again.
    Autumn grain collection should take into account the difficulties of food shortage in cotton-producing areas
    Question: My county is a cotton-producing area. During last year's autumn grain collection, the general practice was to pay in grain, and the proportion of cotton lint was too insignificant. As a result, the general public felt very awkward. Cotton-producing areas do not produce enough grain for self-sufficiency, and selling cotton to exchange for grain to pay taxes is not only "awkward" and "troublesome," but will also stimulate a sudden increase in grain prices, causing the masses to suffer losses. Can this year's autumn grain collection be done by paying what you have, to facilitate the masses?
    (Wuxun Fourth District, Lin Quan)
    Answer: Collection is mainly based on military and civilian needs. However, in order to ensure the supply of military food, our district's collection is mainly grain, followed by physical objects. If the local military needs cotton in your area, a portion of cotton can be collected in order to solve the difficulty of payment for the masses. Otherwise, inappropriate price conversion or long-distance transportation may cause losses to individual areas or to the government, which is not good.
    In addition, the government should have a good grasp of grain prices during collection. Otherwise, fluctuations in grain prices will cause losses to the masses.

### 华北人民政府财政部　对秋征中几个具体问题的解答

专栏：询问答复

　　华北人民政府财政部
  　对秋征中几个具体问题的解答
    问：薪金制的革命职员是否扣除免税点？
    答：企业部门之工作人员，是供给制者，在他家就扣除一个免税点，是薪金或分红制度，就不能扣除免税点，如若有薪金很低和供给制相当者那是包干的供给制，也应该在家扣除免税点。
    雇工怎样扣除免税点？
    问：税则第九条丙项规定，雇工在雇主家吃饭者在雇主家扣除免征点，但不在雇主家吃饭，而支付工资内也包括了工食，而在雇主家是否也扣除免税点？如不扣除，是否雇主吃亏？是不是凡雇用工人不论是管饭或大包干均应扣除一定免征点？
    答：雇工的免税点按他在雇主家和在自家吃饭的时间，两头计算扣除，大包干的雇工虽然工资内包括一部分工食，一般的说时间很短，同时也和雇工不一样，包干不用雇主计划工作，也不用其耗费做饭的时间，雇主方面有很大的好处，所以不能在雇主家扣除免税点。
    荣退军人不应免负担
    问：新安家之外籍荣誉军人，在负担上是否还应照顾？如确系没有劳力生活困难无力负担者，经政府批准多扣半个免征点是否适当？同时有的借口荣誉证上注有三年免负担之规定，不出负担该如何？　　　　
　　（刘庆五）
    答：新安家的外籍荣誉军人，在负担上和群众是一样，不应该特殊，但如没有劳力，生活困难，确实无力负担者，经县府批准可以暂免负担；至于有的借口荣誉证上注有三年免负担之规定不出负担者，应采取和蔼的态度说服动员，说明三年免负担不是政府的统一规定，应该按华北人民政府颁发的新农业税则办事才对。
    牲口到底应扣除多少消耗？
    问：关于新农业税负担办法，华北人民政府是否已公布？（我们还未见到）在扣除消耗时，牛驴骡马到底扣除多少才对？人民日报一三一号解释什么是比例税一文说：牛驴四市斗，骡马七市斗；可是我记得在赵县传达秋收种麦工作时说：骡马扣除十市斗，牛驴扣除七市斗，现在还这样宣传，因为没有见到新负担办法，对这事弄不清，请答复。　　
　　（冀中导报社　惠生）
    答：新农业税则现正审核研究，尚未正式公布，关于牲口扣除消耗问题，起初税则草案规定骡马为十市斗谷，牛驴为七市斗谷，县里是根据原规定传达的，后经研究，照原规定无牲口户太吃亏，所以改为骡马七市斗，牛驴四市斗，报载是根据改后发表的，所以两项发生差别。各地应根据报上发表的执行。
    按户计算劳力是否合适？
    问：关于农业税，计算劳动力问题，我们有点疑问，就是：计劳力不以人计，而以户计，其中便不免有的吃亏，有的沾光。比如说，有两户都是有五口人，但甲户五口人都有劳动力，而乙户五口人中却只有一个劳动力，按规定，这两户都算有劳动力，那么乙户岂不吃亏？　　（获鹿四完小、冰如、耀东）
    答：关于农业税计算劳力问题，你们感到按户计算，劳力多少不均，就有吃亏有沾光，实际劳力多少，在农业税上影响不大，只有个别贫苦没有劳力生活困难，确实无力负担之军工烈属及鳏寡孤独户，才能每人多扣半个免税点；你们觉得劳力多的户沾光，是说它比劳力少的户生产品得的多，应该多负担些，这是不对的。征的是农业税，主要的对象就是土地收入，不能包括一切。如现在的战勤代耕等劳力负担，对象就是劳动力，劳力多的户就多负担。所以不能把农业税和劳力多少都混在农业税里面，那户沾光那户吃亏，分开来看才对。
    养蜂户如何负担？
    问：城关区有一养蜂户，家中七、八口人，共养蜂三、四十窝，还有一架纺纱机经常纺纱，家中主要生活来源是靠养蜂、纺纱，土地仅有三几亩，自己也不耕种，在外边出租着，过去把他家养蜂纺线都当成副业，家中土地少，人口多，根本够上不拿税，因而常年什么税也负担不着，实际上他家生活很高。象这样户是否纳税？  （行唐　陈英）
    答：首先确定这一户的养蜂纺纱不是副业，因为这户的主要生活来源就是靠养蜂纺纱，仅三几亩土地还是出租。所以不应在副业征税不征税的问题上打圈子，按新税则第二条“自耕或雇人耕种以及出租土地之人户，均有依本税则缴纳农业税之义务”，这户全家人口都不从事农业经营，亦不是主要靠农业生产来生活，所以不能扣除人口免税点，其土地应该全部负担。至于养蜂纺纱的收入应该按工商业负担办法确定负担或不负担及如何负担，不要和农业税混到一块。
    小城市中半农半商户，土地出农业税，扣除免税点按参加农业经营及主要依靠农业生产供应生活的人口扣除，工商业收入部分可按工商业负担办法负担。
    房租收入也应负担
    问：房租收入是否负担？我认为今天房租一般租额不高，修理费很大，为了使他迅速恢复发展城市建设，可以暂免负担。是否妥当？　　
　（刘庆五）
    答：房租收入在城市里是一个很大的收入，还有专靠这种收入维持生活者，你的意见是说现在一般租额不高，同时战争期间修理费很大，为了迅速恢复和发展城镇建设，可暂免负担，这固然是奖励了房宅建筑，但不应该单从一方面着想，因为现在前方战争和后方建设都开支很大，农业工商业等负担都相当重，为了彻底打垮蒋介石，争取战争早日胜利，应该把负担面扩大，使各行各业人民都尽一份力量，所以房租收入也应该分担些负担，这里并不是说不奖励房宅建造，因为奖励并不等于不负担，政府对房租收入在负担上是有照顾的。
    果木山货遇有歉收可否减征？
    问：果木山货按常年应产量，以当地市价六成折米谷计算负担，是比较固定便于计算，但果木山货收入与农作物不同，因一遇歉收，有的根本没有收入，要是让他负担，实在负担不起，是否可以一般年景按六成计算，遇着不收之年，经政府批准减税或免税？
    答：农业新税则规定，果木山货，按常年平均应产量依当地收获与出卖主要季节之一般市价折谷五成（草案起初规定是六成，后经研究为了照顾改为五成）计征，所谓常年平均应产量，就是照顾到丰收歉收挂枝歇枝等情况，按它的平均数来订产，在这里已经是层层的照顾了，你所提的不收之年，在订产时已照顾到了，所以不应该再要求减免负担。
    秋征要照顾产棉区缺粮困难
    问：我县是产棉区，去年秋征时，一般都是交纳的粮食，棉绒占的比重太微乎其微了。因而，一般的群众感到非常蹙扭；棉区产粮，本不足自给，再卖棉花，换交粮食，来回的撒手合手，不光是“蹙扭”，“麻烦”，而且这样还会刺激粮食价格的突然上涨，使群众不少吃亏。请问今年的秋征，能否有啥交啥，便利群众。　
    （武训四区林泉）
    答：征收主要是根据军需民有，但为保障军食供给，我区征收主要是粮食，其次是实物，你区是产棉区，当地军需若用棉花，为了解决群众交纳困难，可以征一部分棉花，否则折价不当或远道运输个别地区吃亏或政府吃亏都是不好的。
    另外，征收时，政府对粮价要很好掌握，否则粮价涨落，群众是会吃亏的。
