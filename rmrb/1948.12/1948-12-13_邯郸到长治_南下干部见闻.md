    From Handan to Changzhi
    Observations of a Southern-Bound Cadre
    [Taihang Dispatch] On this southward journey, many of us cadres have seen inspiring things along the way. However, being eager to march, we collected very little material. I can only write down fragmentary accounts of the situation from Handan to Changzhi below:
    I. Building Roads and Bridges Shows a Long-Term Construction Mindset.
    Not only is the Handan-Shexian railway being built well, but the Handan-Changzhi highway is also well-constructed. The long-unpassable highway now winds around mountains and crosses rivers, with newly built large bridges and half-mile-long tunnels dug through mountains. It is flat and wide, praised by the masses, cadres, and merchants alike. In our view, although it has cost some manpower and money, it is of great significance for the future development of industry and commerce. According to the masses, "This highway solves a big problem (the mountain gullies were impassable in summer). Now we have cheap coal to burn and cotton to spin thread. Ironware and bamboo products are coming in, and mountain products can be sold out. North-south trade is convenient, and we (farmers) can make enough to eat by pulling carts in our spare time." In Xiwu Village, Shexian County, hauling 100 catties for 60 li costs 13 catties of millet. A cart with iron wheels can support three or four people. Lao He, from Yetao Town, Wu'an County, said: "I was allocated three mu of land during the land distribution. By transporting coal back and forth for two days, I can earn a net profit of 15 to 25 catties of rice, which is barely enough for my family of five."
    The daily road maintenance is very good. Wherever there is a pothole, the village automatically repairs it. If iron-wheeled carts are driven on the paved road, the villagers generally intervene.
    II. From Wu'an to Changzhi, the county, district, and village cadres along the way are very enthusiastic towards the southern-bound cadres. They have been of great help in finding accommodation, firewood, and milling flour for us, truly worthy of being from the old liberated areas. The county committees of Shexian, Lucheng, and Licheng have all sent one or two cadres to help us raise grain. The village cadres of Yetao Town even mobilized all the women in the village to help us cook. In Shexian city, more than 500 people were organized to welcome and send off the southern-bound cadres, with gongs and drums shaking the sky, greatly inspiring everyone.
    III. Model Plaques, Hero Lists, Glory Plaques, Model Banners, Hero Flags, etc., can be found in every village. This method of cultivating various heroes and models, driving work, and educating the masses is very good. Along the way, every village has large and small signs, certificates, and plaques with "Glorious Military Dependents," "Southern-Bound Cadres are Most Glorious," "XX Labor Hero," "XX War Model," and so on. According to the village cadres, this has a great impact and education on the masses. Especially on the production front, it has played a driving role.
    According to the villagers, the celebration ceremonies are very lively, "like praising officials in the past." Now the military dependents and models here have a very high status among the masses.
    IV. Production is well-organized in some places. Developing production, organizing mutual aid, setting up workshops, doing business... all these exist in every village, and some are very good. The village cadres all take the lead in forming free combinations to do business. According to our understanding, the village cadres attach great importance to production. There are many mutual aid organizations between them (village cadres) and the masses, and the relationship is also good.
    According to the masses in Dongyangguan, Licheng County: "In the past, women here did not go to the fields to work. Since the People's Liberation Army came, women have started to work in the fields." In the past, people did not unbind their feet. Now, generally, ten-year-olds have unbound their feet, but some seventeen-year-olds still have bound feet.
    V. Some veteran cadres have not yet recovered after the rectification campaign. According to the materials obtained along the way in Shexian County, some veteran cadres are still not in high spirits. Furthermore, a small number of people's perceptions of the veteran cadres have not changed.
    Some military dependents in Piandian, Shexian County, reflected: "The new cadres don't care, and the old cadres don't care either," which also shows that some veteran cadres have not yet recovered their spirits.
    VI. The masses have a high degree of awareness and firmly believe in the correct leadership of the Communist Party. Many families of emancipated peasants hang portraits of Chairman Mao, which is very good.
    VII. A few scattered issues:
    (1) The feudal remnants here are significant. There are still seven- or eight-year-old girls with bound feet, wearing braids, and wearing earrings. Individual villages still have arranged marriages.
    (2) The style of carts is old and clumsy, and they need to be improved urgently.

### 邯郸到长治  南下干部见闻

    邯郸到长治
    南下干部见闻
    【太行讯】我们一部分干部这次南下，一路上令人兴奋的见闻很多，只是急于行军，搜集材料很少，仅就邯郸到长治一段的精形，片断地写在下面：
    一、修路筑桥，是个长期建设的气慨。
    不但邯涉铁路建设的好，邯长公路修筑亦不错；年久不通的公路，今天绕山越水，筑新式大桥，挖半里长的穿山洞，平坦宽阔，群众干部商人，无不称赞。据我们看，虽费了一些人力和钱财，但对今后工商业开展意义甚大。据群众反映：“这条公路可解决了大问题（夏天山沟不能走）了，有贱煤烧，有棉花纺线，铁器竹货都进来了，山货能卖出去了。南北交易方便，我们（农民）闲时拉脚就够吃了”。涉县西仵村每六十里拉一百斤，运费十三斤小米，一个牛铁轮车可养活三四口人，武安冶陶镇村名叫老鹤的说：“平分时分得三亩地，买了一头牛，来回运煤两天可净得十五斤至二十五斤米，家中五口人便将将就就的够吃了。”
    平日护路工作很好；那里有了坑，那村便自动修补。如有铁轮车走汽路，一般村民都干涉。
    二、由武安到长治沿途县区村干部，对南下干部非常热情；对我们住宿找房，找柴磨面帮助甚大，真不愧是老区。涉县、潞城、黎城各县委都派一两个干部协助我们筹措粮食等，冶陶镇村干部并动员全村妇女帮助我们做饭，涉县城里组织了五百多人欢迎欢送南下干部，锣鼓喧天，对大家鼓舞不小。
    三、模范牌、英雄榜、光荣牌、模范匾、英雄旗等，各村都有。这种培养各种英雄模范，带动工作，教育群众的方法很好。沿途村村都有“光荣军属”、“南下干部最光荣”、“××劳动英雄”、“××参战模范”………等大牌小牌，奖状，门匾。根据村干部讲，对群众影响教育很大。特别是在生产战线上，起了推动作用。
    据村民说，庆功时很热闹，“象过去夸官一样”，——现在这里军属模范在群众中的地位很高。
    四、生产有的搞的好。开展生产，组织互助开作坊做买卖…………等，村村皆有，并且有的很好，各村干部都带头自由组合做买卖。根据我们了解，村干部都很重视生产。他们（村干）与群众互助组织很多，并且关系也不错。
    据黎城东阳关群众反映：“过去我们这里妇女都不下地做活，从人民解放军来了，妇女才下地做活”，过去人们不放脚，现在十来岁的一般都放脚了，十七岁上下有的尚缠着脚。
    五、整党后有的老干部尚未恢复元气；根据涉县沿途所得材料，有的老干部情绪仍不高；再者，少数群众对老干部的认识尚未转变。
    涉县偏店几个军属反映：“新干部不管，老干部也不管”亦说明有些老干部情绪尚未恢复过来。
    六、群众觉悟程度高，坚信共产党的正确领导，有不少的翻身农民家庭挂着毛主席的像，很好。
    七、几个零星问题：
    （一）这里封建残余大，尚有七八岁的小女孩缠足，梳辫子，带耳环者，有个别村尚有买卖婚姻。
    （二）大车样式古老，行动笨重，急须改良。
                十一月十七日
