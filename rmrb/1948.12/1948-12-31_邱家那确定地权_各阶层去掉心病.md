　　Qiu Jiana Clarifies Land Ownership
  　Removing Worries from All Levels
    [Our Newspaper's Dispatch] In Qiu Jiana Village, Second District, Qinghe, Southern Hebei, some middle peasants have been unable to shake off their fear of being struggled against since the land review last year. When the work team first arrived in the village and explained the policy of making up for land shortages, the middle peasants said, "Now we're not afraid anymore, we can relax." Some comrades thought that this really relieved the middle peasants' worries, but after in-depth investigation and understanding, this was not the case. For example, Qiu Mengfu, who came from a hired laborer background, had three family members and eleven mu of land. He was so worried that he kept coughing. He was afraid of being struggled against if he didn't hand over land, but it really pained him to hand it over. He went back and forth to the village cadres saying, "I have a lot of land, don't mobilize me, I'll do it voluntarily..." He also said to the comrades in the work team, "...I've been a hired laborer since I was a child... I bought these few mu of land... Alas! Is it okay if I voluntarily give up three mu?" Qiu Fenglu's family had six people and sixteen mu of land. He had a cotton fluffer, but he was too scared to fluff cotton. His mother cried for two days because of worry. Qiu Fengdou's family was so scared that they quickly divided their property. Qiu Fusheng even sold the small trees that were as thick as an arm. Those with money said they had no capital for business, those with food said they had no way to get it, those who harvested a lot said they harvested little. The phenomenon of pretending to be poor was quite common. Some poor peasants were also uneasy, afraid that the land they had been allocated would be redistributed, so they didn't repair it properly or dare to apply much fertilizer. The land reform task in this village was basically completed. The whole village had an average of about two mu of land per person. The sixty-six middle peasant households generally averaged two to two and a half mu per person, with the most having an average of three mu per person. The eighty-two poor peasant households had an average of one mu and five or six fen of land per person, which was enough to maintain their livelihoods. The thirteen households of landlords and rich peasants who had been struggled against had an average of one mu and three fen of land per person, which was also enough to maintain their livelihoods. In addition, there was some temple land, land of childless households, and clan land to supplement the more difficult poor peasants and to settle landlords and rich peasants. It was immediately decided to end the land reform in this village, issue land certificates, fix land ownership, and mobilize production. A mass meeting was held. After the official announcement, the whole village immediately showed a smile that had not been seen for more than a year. Middle peasant Qiu Fenglu said, "This is the real cure for our worries... I'll fluff cotton tomorrow." (Southern Hebei Daily)

　　邱家那确定地权
  　各阶层去掉心病
    【本报讯】冀南清河二区邱家那村，有些中农从去年复查到现在，始终没去掉“怕被斗”的心事。工作组刚到村时，讲解了抽补政策，中农说：“这可不害怕了，可放心了。”有的同志就认为真解除了中农的心病，从来经过深入检查了解，并不是这样，象雇工出身的邱梦孚，全家三口人，十一亩地，他愁的光哼咳，不拿地怕挨斗，拿地真心痛。他来回找村干说：“我的地多，别动员我，我自动……。”又跟工作组的同志说：“……我从小扛活……买了这几亩地……唉！我自动三亩行吧？”邱凤禄家六口人、十六亩地，有个弹花弓，吓的也不弹了，他娘就愁的哭了两天。邱凤斗家吓的赶快把家分了。邱傅生就把对把粗的小树都卖了。有钱的说做买卖没本，有吃的说没法，收的多说收的少，装穷现象相当普遍。有的贫农心里也是不安稳，怕把分的地再给捣换了，不好好修理、不敢多施粪。这村土改任务大致完成，全村每人平均二亩左右地，六十六户中农一般的平均二亩至二亩半，最多的每人平均三亩；八十二户贫农，每人平均一亩五、六分地，都能维持生活，被斗地、富十三户，每人平均一亩三分地，也能维持生活，另外还有点庙地、绝户地、族地够补补比较困难的贫农和安置地富。当即决定这村结束土改，发土地证，固定地权，发动生产。召开群众会。正式宣布后，全村群众立时表现出一种一年多未有过的笑容。中农邱凤禄说：“这才真去了病根……我明天就弹棉花。”（冀南日报）
