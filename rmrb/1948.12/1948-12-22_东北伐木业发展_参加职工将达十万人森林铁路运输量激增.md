Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 19th. To realize the plan of producing four million cubic meters of timber next year, the Northeast Forestry Bureau has mobilized a vast number of lumberjacks to go into the mountains for felling. Since the beginning of last month, large numbers of lumberjacks have successively entered the vast forest area from the Xing'an Mountains to the right bank of the Yalu River to engage in production. As of recently, the number of participants in logging has reached 40,000, and the number of trees felled has exceeded 500,000 cubic meters. When all are in place, the total number of employees participating in logging will reach 100,000, with 70,000 head of livestock. In order to strive to transport the huge amount of felled timber to the rafting river banks or railway transportation concentration points according to plan before the spring thaw, the Forestry Bureau has actively carried out transportation preparation work simultaneously with timber felling. Local forestry bureaus have begun to rectify forest railways, rush to repair ice roads, prepare transportation tools, and materials and supplies needed for the construction of dams, sluice gates, and river cables. After initial rectification, the transportation volume of forest railways has been increased compared to before.

　　东北伐木业发展
    参加职工将达十万人森林铁路运输量激增
    【新华社哈尔滨十九日电】为实现明年生产木材四百万立方公尺的计划，东北林务局已动员广大伐木工人上山采伐。自上月上旬起，大批伐木工人即已陆续进入兴安岭至鸭绿江右岸广大森林区内从事生产。截至最近，参加伐木者已达四万人，伐倒的树木已达五十万立方公尺以上。待全部到齐时参加采伐的职工总人数将达十万人，牲口七万匹。林务局为争取在明春解冻前把巨量伐成的木料按计划运到流送河岸或铁路运输集中地，已于木材采伐同时积极地进行了运输准备工作。各地林务局已开始整顿森林铁路，赶修冰道、准备运输工具以及用于修建河坝、水闸、河绠所需的器材和物资。经初步整顿后的森林铁路，运输量已较前提高。
