　　Preliminary Experiences of Xinzhuang Coal Mine on Wage Standards and Labor Organization
    Since late August, Xinzhuang Coal Mine has implemented a piece-rate wage system. In terms of wage standards, labor organization, quantity and quality inspection, and work recording and closing, we have encountered many complex problems. After three months of experimentation and exploration, although some problems have not been resolved satisfactorily and require continued exploration in the future, the vast majority of workers have become accustomed to this new system. Since the end of the autumn harvest and wheat planting in mid-October, with a gradual increase in the number of workers, production has become regularized. In November, after adjusting wages, reorganizing the underground labor force, and strictly enforcing discipline education, the output has increased from 160 tons per day in early November to over 200 tons. The development and changes during these three months are analyzed and explained from the following aspects.
    　　　　I. Wage Standard Issues
    To determine wage standards, it is necessary to conduct a relatively accurate and reliable survey and understanding of the production efficiency of general workers in order to set appropriate standards. If the production efficiency is overestimated, the wage standard will be relatively lowered, resulting in disappointment for most workers. If the production efficiency is underestimated, the wage standard will be relatively raised, forming a high-wage policy. An appropriate standard should be one that 70% or even 80% of skilled workers can achieve or slightly exceed, so as to stimulate the confidence of the broad masses of workers in increasing production.
    Regarding the combination of production efficiency and wage standards, we have revised it four times from the beginning to the present. Initially, our leadership thought that the requirement for the production efficiency of a standard worker should rather be too high than too low. It is easier to lower the standard if it is too high, but difficult to raise it if it is too low. Conversely, in terms of wage standards, the thinking was that it should rather be too low than too high. It is easier to raise the standard if it is too low, but difficult to lower it if it is too high. Under this guiding ideology, our survey data on production efficiency took the records of the peak of last winter's production campaign and the efficiency of workers with strong labor and good skills as the standard. As for the wage standard, we initially set it slightly higher than the current standard at that time, but still somewhat lower than the standard set by the Shimen Conference. The result of implementation was that only a few people could meet or exceed the standard, and most people could not. The workers reflected that "the steamed bun is hung on the top of the tree, and they can see it but can't eat it." "Working hard is not enough for the system." This created ideological confusion among the workers in the early stages. Subsequently, the leadership accepted the workers' opinions, convened a meeting of underground cadres, and re-examined and revised the standard, and the mood became stable.
    Secondly, the influence of the past egalitarian wage policy on the workers' thinking must also be sufficiently estimated: "Everyone is a worker, what's the difference, everyone is equal." This view has been solidified in the workers' minds for a long time, especially among the part-time farmer and part-time miner workers, this thinking is the most solidified. Even if we subjectively want to break egalitarianism, we will be rejected and will not receive the desired results. At the beginning, we believed that the tunneling and timbering workers underground required technical skills, and the wage standard should be higher. The handling workers were simple manual labor, and anyone could do it as long as they had strength, and the wage standard should be lower. As a result, it formed difficulties in labor organization. Everyone wanted to go underground to do timbering, and no one wanted to pull the windlass. Later, in revising the standard, we encountered this problem again, if one thing was increased, the other thing would have to be moved. As long as there is one place that is not balanced, the labor force will be difficult to organize well. In November, after another wage adjustment, democracy was fully promoted. The workers themselves put forward opinions and set standards, which were finally reviewed and decided by the factory management committee. As a result of the assessment, the underground tunneling, timbering, handling, hook, and rail laying workers were almost all at the same wage standard—2.77 yuan. Only in areas with relatively bad working conditions, such as watery areas and recovery areas, was it slightly higher—3.02 yuan. It looks very egalitarian, but because it is piece-rate wages, the labor strength and skill level of various workers vary greatly. We have counted the proportion of wages earned by night shift workers in late November. Although the standard wages were set equally, the labor results varied greatly. The highest was 4.5 yuan to 6 yuan (mostly tunneling and timbering workers), the lowest was 0.8 yuan to 1.9 yuan, and most people could meet or exceed the standard.
    　　　　II. Labor Organization Issues
    The organization of labor underground is the most troublesome issue. If it is not resolved well, it will affect production. The problems we have encountered here are as follows:
    First, the lack of coordination in labor organization. If there is no long-term fixed miner as the backbone underground, or if the workers' skill level and labor strength are not understood, incoordination will occur in labor organization. When we started implementing piece-rate wages, it was the beginning of the autumn harvest, and the workers could not be fixed. Sometimes there was a lack of windlass, and sometimes there was a lack of skilled pickmen. Today, strong Zhang San came, and tomorrow weak Li Si was replaced. It was very difficult for the production team leader to assign work. If there were few windlasses, the coal dug by the skilled pickmen could not be pulled out, and they had to use a pick to throw it out; if the windlass could not pull it out, the coal loaders could not keep up. If there were few skilled pickmen, the windlass and coal loaders would have no coal to handle. Sometimes, if a certain worker was injured or had other urgent work that required temporary transfer, the same difficulties would occur. Transferring handling workers would affect mining, and transferring mining workers would inevitably affect handling. Later, after research, it was decided to organize and allocate other labor with the skilled pickman as the main body, and adopt a voluntary combination method. Strong skilled pickmen were equipped with strong windlasses, and weak skilled pickmen were equipped with weak windlasses. However, due to the restrictions of the lack of workers during the busy farming season, it was not easy to choose and equip them. The incoordination phenomenon was relatively reduced until the end of the busy farming season in October when the workers were full. However, some temporary rural workers still take turns to work in shifts, and some fourteen or fifteen-year-old children come, whose labor is not as good as an adult worker, but occupies a certain production position. They are exhausted before they can finish their time, which not only hinders their own development, but also affects the production of others. Recently, after review, the existing child laborers have been assigned to do other light work, and no new child laborers will be recruited in the future. As for how to organize and use this part of the temporary short-term miners to completely overcome the incoordination phenomenon, it is still an important issue to be further studied and resolved.
    Second, fixed posts and flexible mobility. Organizing and equipping other labor with the skilled pickman as the main body, combining the strong with the strong, and combining the weak with the weak, is still a relatively appropriate method of organizing labor today. However, since there are some temporary short-term workers, their labor skills are not easy to understand, master, and rationally organize and use. If the posts are completely fixed, it will be like the above-mentioned: if an obstacle occurs in one place, it will affect other places. If the posts are not fixed, they cannot give full play to their expertise, improve their skills and efficiency. When there was a shortage of labor during the busy farming season, we transferred timbering workers to mine coal. As a result, their efficiency was only 50% of that of skilled pickmen. We also transferred coal loading workers to pull windlasses. As a result, they were so tired that they could not stand up straight, and they did not pull as much as a seventeen or eighteen-year-old child. This is detrimental to both the workers and production. Now, in our labor organization, we have adopted the principle of basically fixing posts, giving full play to expertise, and never easily changing unless there are special circumstances. In particular, for more technical work such as skilled pickmen and timbering, it should be fixed and specialized. However, coal handling workers working in the same area do not necessarily have to follow one skilled pickman. If there is coal in the Jia cave and not enough to pull in the Yi cave, the windlass team leader can transfer any coal handling worker from the Yi cave to the Jia cave to handle it. After this method was implemented, the incoordination between mining and handling was overcome.
    Third, the organizational leadership of the team: This issue has been debated. Dividing the team according to the lane is more concentrated, but the team leader does not leave production. If he takes care of his own work, he cannot check and lead. Because there are various types of workers in a lane, everyone is working all day in their own post, and cannot understand and grasp the overall situation. If the team is organized according to the lane, it will inevitably become a formality and will not play a role.
    If the team is organized according to the type of work, the underground area is very large, and there are the same types of workers in each area and lane, so it is impossible to achieve leadership. Without setting up a team, the production team leader and technician are too busy to grasp it directly. After three months of research and experimentation, the most dispersed tunneling and timbering workers are assigned and checked directly by the production team leader. These two types of workers do not have teams. Coal handling workers in large lanes and coal handling workers in coal caves are divided into teams according to work areas. The team leader takes the lead in work, supervises and inspects. It does not affect his own production, and it also plays a leading role.
    In short, underground labor organization is a very precise organizational work. We have taken many detours in the past on this issue. We will only comprehensively study and organize a few of the larger issues in order to continue to explore and improve in future work.
    　　　　III. Quantity and Quality Inspection Issues
    Implementing piece-rate wages, in addition to the meaning of rewarding quantity and quality in the wage policy itself, mainly depends on the regular education of workers. The common problem that workers often make is that they emphasize quantity over quality, so our inspection focuses on quality first and then quantity. In particular, the specifications of lanes and the specifications of timbering should be carefully checked, because this is a major issue related to the safety of the mine. After we implemented piece-rate wages, the problem with the specifications of the lanes was that they were too narrow and small and did not meet the specified dimensions. Although this would not affect the safety of the mine, the failure to meet the specifications would affect the erection of the roof timber, which would either be labor-intensive or costly. The general problem with timbering is that the pillar kiln is not deep enough, and there is also a phenomenon of using thin wood to save labor when thick wood should be used, and using small materials for large purposes. This will affect the firmness and safety of the lanes. Technicians and production team leaders should take more responsibility in the daily work of inspecting roof timber and lanes, and educate the workers. At the same time, necessary penalties should be implemented. However, penalties should only be applied to individual workers who repeatedly commit mistakes and do not change, or whose mistakes are relatively serious. If penalties are used to solve problems in general, it is easy to form antagonism with the workers and fail to achieve the purpose of improving work.
    　　　　IV. Work Recording and Closing Issues
    A large factory has a certain shift handover system, with no interval time in between. If the order of work recording and closing for individual piecework is not arranged well, the time is not organized well, or the work recorder is not skilled, it will affect the working time. At the same time, work recording is not only to complete the recording of quantity, but also to record the quality of the work and whether it meets the specifications, and then to calculate the wages according to the quantity and quality. That is to say, work recording must be combined with quantity and quality inspection. It is also a relatively difficult task to allow the work recorder to complete the recording of each worker's work results within an hour without affecting the underground production time. Designing more work recorders may speed up the work recording time, but having more people away from production will affect the increase in costs. Our three-month experimentation process is as follows:
    Two work recorders, one for the day shift and one for the night shift. The quality inspection is mainly the responsibility of the technicians and production team leaders. However, because the technicians and production team leaders are not fully responsible, the work recorders have to go down and cooperate with the technicians and production team leaders to conduct a general inspection before starting to register the quantity and quality of each person. Every time the shift changes at eight o'clock, the work recorders have to go down the mine at six o'clock. When the workers see the work recorders go down, their production mood changes. Some of the skilled pickmen in the coal mining cave are afraid of being at a disadvantage when calculating the quantity, so they no longer pick forward, but adopt the method of mud walls to trim the roof neatly and wait for the work recorders to close. Some of the windlass are afraid that they will not be counted if they do not pull enough full baskets, so they wait for the closing even if they have enough. As a result, within two hours, the workers are waiting for the closing and cannot carry out production normally.
    Later, in order to take up less of the workers' production time, the work recorders changed to going down the mine at seven o'clock, and the technicians and production team leaders were held fully responsible for the quality inspection. The coal handling workers' team leader and the mine mouth checked the number of baskets, recorded how much each person pulled, and reported to the work recorders for registration. The work recorders only measured the progress of the tunneling workers underground, and all other workers relied on the reports of the technicians, team leaders, and team leaders. After this change, the work recording time was shortened, and the workers could carry out labor in shifts. However, there is still a considerable distance to go to achieve accurate work recording, especially the quality recording.
    The above are some of the more complex but necessary problems to be solved in the implementation of piece-rate wages. Although we have gone through three months of experimentation, there are still many loopholes in our work in these months, which need to be further studied and improved in the future.

　　辛庄煤矿关于工资标准与劳力组织等问题的初步经验
    辛庄煤矿从八月下旬起，实行了按件计资。在工资标准上、劳力组织上、数量质量检查上、以及计工收工上，碰到过很多复杂问题。经过三个月的实验、摸索，虽有些问题解决的还不够妥善，需要今后继续摸索，但是这个新的制度，在绝大多数工人的思想上已经习惯了。从十月中旬秋收种麦结束，工人逐渐满员后，生产已经走向正规。十一月份又经过调整工资，整顿井下劳力组织，严格纪律教育，产量已由十一月初的每天一百六十吨增加到二百多吨。三个月中的发展变化，从以下几个问题来加以研究说明。
    　　　　一、工资标准问题
    确定工资标准，首先必须把一般工人的生产效率，作比较确实可靠的调查了解，才能订的恰当。如果生产效率估计高了，工资标准就会相对降低，结果多数工人会感到失望。如果生产效率估计低了，工资标准就会相对提高，形成高工资政策。适当的标准，应当是百分之七十以上甚至百分之八十的熟练工人都能达到或稍有超过，这样才能刺激起广大工人群众增产的信心。
    对于生产效率与工资标准的结合问题，从开始到现在曾经过四次修改，起初在我们领导思想上对于一个标准工生产效率的要求，存在着宁失之于高，不失之于低，高了降低好办，低了提高就困难了。相反地，在工资标准上，却存在宁失之于低，不失之于高，低了提高好办，高了降低就困难了。在这个思想指导下，我们对于生产效率的调查材料，是把去年冬季生产运动达到最高潮时的纪录，以及劳力较强、技术较好的工人的效率当作标准。至于工资标准，起初我们定的较当时现行标准稍高一些，比较石门会议定的标准还有些低。实行结果，只有少数人能达到或超过标准，多数人达不到。工人反映说：“馒头挂到树顶上，眼看着吃不到嘴里。”“出了力干不够制度。”形成开始时期工人的思想混乱。随后领导上接受了工人的意见，召开了井下干部会议，重新审查修正了标准，情绪才走上安定。
    其次，过去历史上工资政策的平均主义，对于工人思想的影响，也必须足够地估计：“都是个工人，要怎样，都怎样，平等待遇。”这种观点，在工人思想上长时期凝固地存在，尤其是半农半工的矿工，这种思想最凝固。我们主观上要想打破平均主义，碰了钉子也收不到希望的结果。开始我们认为井下掘进工、支木工，讲究技术，工资标准应该高一些。搬运工是简单体力劳动，只要有力气，谁都可以干，工资标准应该低一些。结果形成了劳力组织上的困难。都去下棚子，没人拉＠辘。以后在修改标准中，又碰到这个提一提，那个也得动，只要有一个地方秤不平，劳力就很难组织好。十一月间，又经过一次调整工资，充分发扬了民主。由工人自己提意见、定标准，经工厂管理委员会作最后审查决定。评定结果，井下的掘进、支木、搬运、把钩、钉道等几类工人，几乎全部是同样一个工资标准——二点七七＠。只有劳动条件比较坏的地方，如有水区、回采区才比较稍高一些——三点零二＠。看起来非常平均主义，但因为是按件计资，实行结果，各种工人的劳力强弱，技术好坏，却有很大差别。我们曾统计了十一月下旬夜班工人所得工资比例，虽然标准工资定的平均，但劳动结果有很大差别。最高有达四点五＠到六个＠的（掘进工、支木工多）最低有零点八到一点九＠的，一般都能达到或超过标准。
    　　　　二、劳力组织问题
    井下的劳力组织是个最费脑筋的问题，解决不好，就要影响生产，我们这里曾经发生的问题有以下几个：
    第一、劳力组织上的不协调现象。如果井下没有一部分长期固定矿工作为骨干，或是不了解工人的技术高低、劳力强弱，在组织劳力上都会发生不协调现象。我们开始实行按件计资，正是秋收开始，工人不能固定，有时缺乏＠辘，有时缺乏老镢，今天来了强张三，明天又换了弱李四，生产队长派活非常困难，＠辘少了，老镢刨下煤拉不出来，还得用镢往外撩；＠辘拉不出来，推筐的装煤也赶不上。老镢少了，＠辘、推筐都没煤搬运。有时某种工人负伤或有其他紧要活需临时调动，也会发生同样困难。抽调了搬运工，采掘也要受影响，抽调了采掘工，也必然影响到搬运。后来经过研究，确定以老镢为主体，组织配备其他劳力，采取自愿结合办法，强老镢配备强＠辘，弱老镢配备弱＠辘。但因受了农忙工人缺乏的限制，不好选择配备，直到十月间农忙结束工人满员以后，不协调现象才比较减少。但是还有一部分临时性的农村工人轮流到班，其中还来一些十四五岁的孩子，劳力不顶一个成工，却占了一定的生产岗位，做不到时间就筋疲力竭，既妨害他本身发育，又影响别人生产，最近经过审查，把现有童工分配做其他轻活，今后不再吸收新童工。至如何组织使用这部分临时性的短期矿工，完全克服不协调现象，还是尚待继续研究解决的一个重要问题。
    第二、固定岗位与机动灵活问题。以老镢为主体来组织配备其他劳力，强与强结合，弱与弱结合，这样组织劳力，今天考虑还是比较合适的办法。但是既有一部分临时性的短期工人，他们的劳力技术，不容易了解掌握与合理地组织使用，如果完全固定了岗位，就会象以上所举的：一处发生了障碍，要影响别处。不固定岗位，则不能发挥专长，提高技术与效率。在农忙劳力缺乏时，曾抽调下棚工去刨煤，结果他的效率只当熟练老镢的百分之五十，我们也抽调过抽筐工人去拉＠辘，结果累得直不起腰，还不如一个十七八岁的小孩子拉的多，这样对工人对生产都不利。现在我们在劳力组织上，采取了基本上固定岗位，发挥专长，非不得已的特殊情况，决不轻易变动。特别是老镢、下棚等比较带技术性的工作，更应固定化、专门化。但在同一地区工作的搬运工，就不一定死跟住一个老镢进行工作。如果甲洞有存煤，乙洞不够拉，则＠辘组长可以调动乙洞任何一个搬运工到甲洞搬运。这一办法实行后，采掘与搬运中间不协调的现象克服了。
    第三、小组的组织领导问题：这个问题曾起过争论。依巷洞划分小组，比较集中，但小组长既不脱离生产，他顾了自己工作，就无法检查领导。因为一个巷洞，各种工别都有，谁都是站在自己岗位整天工作，不能够了解掌握全面。如果依巷洞组织小组，必然要流于形式，不起作用。
    如以工别组织小组，则井下地区很大，同类工人，各区各巷都有，也无法实现领导。不设小组，生产队长与技术员直接掌握也忙不过来。经过三个月的研究实验结果，工作最分散的掘进工、支木工，由生产队长直接派活、检查。这两种工人，不设小组。大巷搬运工，与煤洞搬运工，依工作地区划分小组。小组长带头工作，督促检查。既不影响他本人生产，又起了领导作用。
    总之，井下的劳力组织，是一件非常精密的组织工作，我们过去在这个问题上绕的弯路不少，只将几个较大的问题，加以综合研究整理，以便在今后工作中继续摸索改进。
    　　　　三、数量质量检查问题
    实行按件计资，除了在工资政策本身就带有奖励数质量的意义外，主要靠对工人的经常教育。工人一般常犯的毛病是重量不重质，所以我们检查的重点是应先质后量。特别是巷洞的规格与支木的规格更应仔细检查，因为这是关系井下安全与否的重大问题。我们在实行按件计资后，巷洞规格上的毛病是又窄又小不够规定尺寸，这样虽然不致影响井下安全，但是不够规格就要影响棚木的架设，不是费工就是费料。支木一般的毛病，是柱窑打的不够深，也有该用粗木头，为了省工用细木，小材大用的现象。这就会影响到巷洞的坚固与安全。检查棚木与巷洞应由技术员与生产队长在日常工作的指导中多负责任，教育工人。同时实行必要的处罚。但处罚只应是对个别屡犯不改或错误比较严重的工人，如果一般都以处罚来解决问题，容易与工人形成对抗达不到改进工作的目的。
    　　　　四、计工收工问题
    一个规模较大的工厂工作时间都有一定的接班换班制，中间没有间隔时间。单人按行按件的计工收工的办法，如果先后次序排列不好，时间组织不好，或是计工员不熟练，都会影响做工时间。同时计工不单是完成数量的计载，而且要计载质量的好坏以及是否符合规格，然后才能按量、质积计算工资。也就是说记工必须结合数质量检查。如果让计工员在一个钟头内完成每个工人工作结果的记载而又不致影响井下生产时间，也是一件比较困难的事情，多设计工员则完成计工的时间可能快些，但脱离生产人员多了，又要影响成本提高。我们三个月的实验过程是这样：
    两个记工员一个担任白班记工，一个担任夜班记工。质量检查主要由技术员与生产队长负责。但因为技术员生产队长负不到责任，记工员下去之后要协同技术员与生产队长作一次普遍地检查才按每人数质量开始登记。每逢八点换班，记工员六点就得下井。工人看到记工员下去，生产情绪就起了变化，刨煤洞的老镢有的怕排量时折算吃亏不再向前镢进，而采取泥墙的办法所帮顶刷的齐齐整整等计工员收工。＠辘有的怕拉不够整筐不给算数凑够数也等着收工。结果在两个钟头时间内由于工人等待收工，不能正常进行生产。
    以后为了少占工人生产时间，计工员改变为七点下井，责成技术员与生产队长对检查质量负全责，搬运工人小组长与井口对正筐数，记清每一人工拉多少向记工员汇报登记。记工员在井下只是排量一下掘进工的进度，其他工人全依靠技术员队长与小组长的报告。这样改变后，计工时间缩短了，工人可以班接班地进行劳动。但做到计工的精确无误，特别是质量记载，还有相当距离。
    以上几个问题都是实行按件计资中比较复杂但又必须解决的问题。我们虽然经过三个月的实验，但在这几个月工作中，还存在很多漏洞，有待今后继续研究改进。
