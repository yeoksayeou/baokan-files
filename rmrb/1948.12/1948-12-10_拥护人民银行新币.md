　　In the past, there were several kinds of currencies in the Liberated Areas. North China had the Ji鈔 (Ji Banknote) and Border Region Currency, East China had the Beihai Currency and Central China Currency, and Northwest China had the Xibei Farmer's Bank Currency. These currencies were created when the enemy divided our Liberated Areas into several parts. With the victory of the Liberation War, the Liberated Areas gradually became integrated. It is very inconvenient to use different currencies. Recently, the governments of North China, Shandong, Jin-Sui, and Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Liberated Areas have discussed a good solution. They decided to establish the People's Bank of China and issue a new currency from December 1st, which will be used throughout the three regions of North China, East China, and Northwest China. One yuan of the new currency is equivalent to one hundred yuan of Ji钞, one thousand yuan of Border Region Currency, one hundred yuan of Beihai Currency, and two thousand yuan of Xibei Farmer's Bank Currency. Before the old currencies are withdrawn, they will still be used at the exchange rate. After this unification, it will be more convenient for everyone to do business, and the markets in the Liberated Areas will definitely be more prosperous, which is of great benefit to us. Within one year, we will fundamentally overthrow Chiang Kai-shek, and only the currency of our People's Bank of China will be accepted throughout China. We must cherish the new currency!

　　拥护人民银行新币
    过去解放区有好几种票子，华北有冀钞、边币，华东有北海币、华中币，西北有西农币；这些票子都是敌人把咱各个解放区分割成几块的时候产生的。随着解放战争的胜利，各解放区渐渐打成一片，票子不统一，用起来就很不方便。最近华北、山东、晋绥、陕甘宁各解放区政府商量了一个好办法，决定成立中国人民银行，从十二月一号起出一种新票子，在华北、华东、西北三区到处通用。新币一元顶冀钞一百元，顶边币一千元，顶北海币一百元，顶西农币两千元。旧票子没有收回以前，照这价钱折合照旧通用，这样统一了以后，大家做买卖更方便了，各解放区市场一定会更繁华，对咱们有很大好处。一年以内从根本上打倒了蒋介石，全中国就只有咱中国人民银行的票子吃得开；咱们一定要好好爱护新币！
