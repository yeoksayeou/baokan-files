　　Implementing the Decision of the North China Bureau on the Education of On-the-Job Cadres
  　Various Regions Launch Theoretical and Cultural Learning
    [Taihang News] In order to implement the decision of the North China Bureau on the education of on-the-job cadres, and to strengthen the learning of cadres so as to adapt to the rapidly developing victorious situation, the Pingding County Party Committee specially convened a cadre learning mobilization meeting on the 4th of this month. About 60 leading cadres from county-level agencies and districts participated. Comrade Ge Yisheng, the county secretary, explained the importance of learning according to the spirit of the North China Bureau's decision on the education of on-the-job cadres, and reviewed the previous learning. The review pointed out that in the past, the County Party Committee itself believed that studying theory was high-flown "doctrinairism" and not as good as doing more practical work; most cadres did not pay attention to learning either, believing that it was not as important as work, regarding learning as incidental, and even as a burden, using the excuse of being busy with work not to study. Some comrades felt that they were old, had low education levels, and could not catch up with learning. Cadres going to the countryside emphasized the lack of newspapers and did not actively try to learn. The comrades in the agencies also engaged in the old experience-oriented way of learning, without specifying concrete methods according to the different situations of the cadres, and learning was unplanned, sporadic, and unsystematic. After the review, future learning was arranged according to the spirit of the North China Bureau's decision. A Learning Committee was established in the county, composed of seven people including the county secretary and county head, responsible for researching and leading the learning of county and district cadres throughout the county. Learning groups were established below according to the various departments, and a Learning Committee was established in the district. It was decided that after the cadres attending the meeting returned, they would carry out mobilization and specific arrangements, and report the plans to the county. Cadres were divided into three groups, A, B, and C, according to their different levels, with one group leader for each group. The learning content for Group A was the History of Social Development, On Coalition Government, On Internationalism and Nationalism, and "Left-Wing" Communism: an Infantile Disorder. Group B would study all except "Left-Wing" Communism: an Infantile Disorder. Group C would mainly study culture. Teachers would be hired by each unit. In addition to the prescribed documents, important documents and newspapers of each period would be combined, with a time of four months, adhering to the two-hour morning learning system. After completing a book or a section, the odd-job workers would be tested by the Learning Committee leaders according to their working hours. Comrade Yisheng finally pointed out that no one could be an exception to learning, and that the learning time should not be used for office work or receiving guests. Various methods (such as taking notes, self-study discussion, explanation, etc.) should be used to intensify learning, so as to undertake the current historical tasks. After the mobilization, the cadres' enthusiasm for learning was high, and a county-wide learning movement was about to begin. (Fu Rong, Wei Chun, Yu Zhen)
    [Taihang News] The directly subordinate organs of the Taihang Sixth Prefectural Committee and the various organs of Wu'an jointly established the On-the-Job Cadre Spare-time Cultural Remedial School on December 5th, with Commissioner Hou Guoying concurrently serving as the principal. All the students, numbering over a hundred, were divided into high and primary classes according to their cultural level. At the opening ceremony on the 5th, Comrade Zhang Hui Ru, the secretary of the prefectural committee, called on everyone to consciously abide by the learning discipline, adhere to the two-hour daily learning system, and work together to run the school well.

    [Beiyue News] More than 20 cadres in the Second District of Lingshou, after listening to the county party committee's report on the current situation, were determined to study hard to welcome the national victory. At the same time, they expressed their firm obedience to the party's transfer, and would go wherever the party needed them. (Si Meiyu)
    [Jinan News] The Qinghe County-level Organ Learning Committee, according to the cultural level of the cadres in the county, divided them into Class A and Class B. Class A focused on the study of current events and policies; Class B studied culture, recognized new characters, and explained policies. It is stipulated that the period from December 1st to January 20th is the first phase of study. After this phase of study is completed, all cadres in the county will be tested by district as a unit.
