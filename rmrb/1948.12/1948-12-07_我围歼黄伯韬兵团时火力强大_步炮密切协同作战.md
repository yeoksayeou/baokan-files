　　Xinhua News Agency, Huaihai Front, 4th: Artillery closely cooperated with infantry in combat, playing a significant role in annihilating Huang Botao's corps. On the evening of the 11th of last month, when our army launched a general attack on the Chiang bandit 63rd Army entrenched in Yaowan, our artillery regiment destroyed the Xiaodongmen gate tower and other commanding heights that hindered the infantry's advance with accurate artillery fire during trial firing. After the artillery's fierce bombardment began, enemy bunkers collapsed and flew, and the enemy阵 suddenly fell silent, and our infantry immediately broke in. In the in-depth coordinated battle, the artillery densely bombarded the attacking enemies, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy and powerfully assisting the infantry's advance. After the Battle of Yaowan, the regiment was ordered to rush to the Nianzhuang area to cooperate with the infantry in launching a large-scale annihilation battle. On the 14th, attacking Daxingzhuang, our powerful artillery fire destroyed the outer defenses of the bandits and then extended its range to cover the infantry's charge, completely annihilating a regiment of the enemy's 64th Army. The regiment was then ordered to cooperate in launching a frontal attack on Huang Botao's corps headquarters in Nianzhuang圩. At 10 p.m. on the 19th, the artillery destroyed the enemy's forward positions and gathered bandit groups with a fierce barrage. Subsequently, the infantry immediately jumped over the moat and broke into the enemy阵, finally capturing Nianzhuang圩 at dawn on the 20th. In this campaign, the regiment's shooting skills have been significantly improved, and the infantry commanders and fighters have highly praised the artillery's accurate shooting and close cooperation. The leaders of an infantry column specifically wrote a joint letter to the artillery unit to thank them, stating: "In coordinating with the infantry in combat, you have fully displayed the active spirit of our people's artillery and truly achieved every shot hitting the target with 100% accuracy. You gave the enemy a devastating blow, enabling the infantry to charge and annihilate the enemy smoothly, reducing infantry casualties, and demonstrating the powerful force of infantry-artillery coordination. We, on behalf of all the commanders and fighters, express our heartfelt gratitude and high respect to you."

　　我围歼黄伯韬兵团时火力强大
  　步炮密切协同作战
    【新华社淮海前线四日电】炮兵密切协同步兵作战，在歼灭黄伯韬兵团中发挥了重大作用。上月十一日黄昏，我军开始对困守窑湾之蒋匪六十三军发起总攻后，我军某炮兵团在试射时，即以准确炮火摧毁了阻碍步兵冲锋的小东门楼和其他制高点。在炮兵的猛烈射击开始后，敌碉崩倒飞腾，敌阵突然无声，我步兵立即突入。在纵深的协同战斗中，炮兵射击密集的突击敌人，予敌以重大杀伤，有力地协助了步兵的前进。窑湾战斗结束后，该团奉命兼程赶赴碾庄地区，配合步兵展开大团歼战。十四日攻击大兴庄，我强大炮火摧毁了匪外围工事后，即延伸射程，掩护步兵冲锋，全歼守敌第六十四军的一个团。该团继又奉命配合对碾庄圩黄伯韬兵团司令部展开正面攻击。十九日晚十时，炮兵以猛烈的齐放，摧毁了敌人的前沿阵地和集结的匪群，随后步兵立即跃过水壕，突入敌阵，卒于二十日拂晓攻下碾庄圩。该团在此次战役中，射击技术显著提高，步兵指战员都极赞扬炮兵准确的射击与密切的协同作战。某步兵纵队首长们特联名写信给炮兵部队致谢称：“你们在配合步兵作战中，充分地发扬了我人民炮兵的积极精神，真正做到弹无虚放，百发百中。你们给敌人以摧毁性之打击，使步兵得以顺利冲锋，歼灭敌人，并减少了步兵的伤亡，发挥了步炮协同的强大威力。我们特代表全体指战员向你们表示衷心的感谢和崇高的敬意。”
