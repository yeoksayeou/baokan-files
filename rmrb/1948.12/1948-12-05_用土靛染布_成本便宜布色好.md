　　Dyeing Cloth with Local Indigo
  　Low Cost, Good Color
    [North Yue News] The dyeing workshop of the First Joint Cooperative of the Second District of Fuping uses local indigo to dye cloth, resulting in low costs and good color. The dyeing workshop mostly used foreign indigo in the past year and a half. To eliminate foreign indigo and promote local indigo, it began to use local indigo entirely in August this year. According to preliminary results from trial use, local indigo is cheaper and produces better color. For example, 400 catties of local indigo were purchased in Gaofukou at 6,000 yuan per catty. Each catty can dye two bolts of blue cloth. 1,600 catties were purchased in Central Hebei, with a price of 3,000 yuan per catty, which can dye one bolt of blue cloth. Based on this, the cost of one bolt of blue cloth is 3,000 yuan. If foreign indigo were used, the cost per bolt would be 4,666 yuan. Using local indigo saves 1,666 yuan per bolt compared to using foreign indigo. It is hoped that dyeing workshops in various regions will use local indigo in large quantities to promote local products and eliminate foreign indigo. (Meng Taiyue)

　　用土靛染布
  　成本便宜布色好
    【北岳讯】阜平二区一联社染坊，使用土靛染布，成本便宜布色好。该染坊在一年半内大部使用洋靛，为杜绝洋靛，推销土靛，特于今年八月份开始全部使用土靛。根据试用的初步结果，用土靛成本便宜布色又好。如在高阜口买了土靛四百斤，每斤六千元，每斤可染布二匹（蓝色）；在冀中买了一千六百斤，每斤价格三千元，可染蓝布一匹。根据这样一匹蓝布作本三千元，如用洋靛每匹布即作底四千六百六十六元，用土靛每匹比用洋靛贱一千六百六十六元。望各地染坊大量使用土靛，推销土产杜绝洋靛。  （孟泰岳）
