　　Some villages in Jincheng and other counties are actively carrying out fertilizer accumulation and spinning movements. The fertilizer accumulation plan for the section under the jurisdiction of Jincheng First District requires 800 dan of fertilizer from flour mills, 1,120 dan of collected manure, 4,800 dan of accumulated thatch manure, 2,500 dan of smoked manure, and 180 dan of picked-up manure, for a total planned accumulation of 9,400 dan. The goal is to apply 40 dan of fertilizer per mu of spring land, an increase of 5 dan per mu compared to this year. Various localities have already started practical actions according to the plan. Anle Village in Qinyuan has adopted methods such as trampling sheep pens, cleaning out cattle pens, sweeping garbage, paving road manure, and picking up manure, and has already accumulated more than 1,000 carts. In Baoqiao, Changzi, there are 193 households (out of 219 households in the whole village), and they have a total of 57,488 dan of manure, including what they accumulated before. They have 1,000 mu of spring land, so each mu can be fertilized with an average of 60 dan. Women in various places have also started spinning. For example, Li Fenghua, a spinning hero from Houzhai Natural Village, Fushan Fancun, leads three mutual aid groups to exchange labor for spinning. From November 10th to 20th, two groups have spun 22 jin of thread. Including the thread spun before, they have installed 5 looms and estimate they can weave 126 zhang of cloth. In Bao Village, Changzi, 144 spinning wheels and 50 looms have started spinning and weaving, and they have already spun and woven 294 jin of cotton. Anle Village in Qinyuan has finished weaving with 32 looms, weaving a total of 2,510 chi of cloth, solving the problem of changing clothes next year. In order to facilitate transportation, various places are busy repairing roads and bridges. For example, the two main roads of Zhaigeyi Yicheng Guanmuling and Tongxi Fushan have now begun to be repaired. At the same time, vehicles are being repaired and transportation teams are being organized. Some places are also preparing to chop firewood. In Youlin Village, Qinyuan, 14 people chopped 16,400 jin of firewood in eight days. Kao Village in Changzi also organized 37 livestock to haul coal, planning to solve two-thirds of the coal burned next year this winter. It also implements equal-value labor exchange for hauling coal between households with and without livestock, ensuring that the whole village will have no difficulty burning coal next year.
