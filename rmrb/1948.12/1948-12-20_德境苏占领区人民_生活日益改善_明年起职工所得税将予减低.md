    【Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 17th】The lives of people in the Soviet occupation zone of Germany and East Berlin are further improving. Electric News Agency reports: The German Economic Commission under the leadership of the Soviet Military Administration in East Germany announced on the 12th that workers and technicians in the Soviet occupation zone who exceed and complete their production quotas will receive extra rations of items including flour, meat, sugar, and even cigarettes, brandy, and soap. Workers will receive one to four extra ration units depending on how much they exceed their production quota. The amount of rations will also vary depending on the type of work. In some jobs, exceeding the quota by 10% will earn one unit, while in others, exceeding the production quota by 2% will earn one ration unit. These extra rations will be retroactive to November. This is the second time since October that the rations for workers in the Soviet occupation zone have been increased. Starting in October, supplementary food allowances for some workers in the Soviet occupation zone were greatly increased. Erich Rauscher, Chairman of the German Economic Commission, pointed out at the time that 16 million people would benefit from the increased rations, and the caloric intake of food rations for first-category workers had reached more than 2,300 calories. Furthermore, according to Electric News Agency, the German Economic Commission of the Soviet occupation zone has announced that a new tax law will be implemented from January 1st next year. The income tax for all workers and employees will be reduced by 30%. In the past, private enterprises and state-owned enterprises had the same tax rate, but now it has been decided to reduce the tax rate for state-owned enterprises and cooperatives. Property taxes for small industrial and commercial businesses and farms will also be reduced. The new tax rules will also severely crack down on profits obtained through speculation.

　　德境苏占领区人民
  　生活日益改善
  　明年起职工所得税将予减低
    【新华社陕北十七日电】德境苏占区及东柏林人民生活进一步地获得改善。电通社讯：在东德苏联军政府领导下的德国经济委员会十二日宣布，在苏占区，超过和完成生产定额的工人及技术人员们，将得到包括面粉、肉类、食糖以至于纸烟、白兰地酒及肥皂等类物品的额外配给。工人们将依达成额外生产额的多寡而得到一个至四个的额外配给单位。配给额的多寡，还由劳动种类不同而有所区别。在某些工作中，超过定额百分之十时，可获得一个单位，而在另外一些工作中，超过生产定额百分之二时，即可获得一个配给单位。此种额外配给并将回溯到十一月份算起。按苏占区工人配给量的提高，自本年十月份以来，这已经是第二次。十月份起，苏占区一部分工人曾大为增加副餐费。德国经济委员会主席劳氏曾在当时指出：因增加配给而受益之人民达一千六百万人，而第一类工人所得口粮的热量，则已达到二千三百多卡洛里。又据电通社讯：苏占区德国经济委员会已宣布，从明年一月一日起，将实行新税收法。所有工人和雇员的所得税，均将减低百分之三十。过去私营企业和国营企业的税率是相同的，现在则已决定减低国营企业和合作社的税率。小工商业及农庄的财产税也将予减低。新税则并将沉重打击以投机取得的利润。
