[Ji Lu Yu Telegram] Qingfeng City's Hongda Cooperative, originally a consumer cooperative, has successfully hand-produced matches. Later, it shifted to handicraft production. In October of this year, with the help of some raw materials and dispatched cadres from the Industrial Department's state-owned Zhenxing Match Factory, the cooperative's responsible cadres personally went to the Zhenxing Factory to study. After joint research by all members of the cooperative, they constructed the necessary tools such as steaming rooms, dipping pools, iron plates, and wooden rods, and immediately began work. After more than a month of operation, the output has increased from the initial 50 bundles (one large box) per day to 240 bundles. The trademark is "Hongguang." In addition to selling to merchants in the city, they are also selling in Dongming and Puyang areas. The number of workers participating in match making (mostly elderly men, women, and children) has increased from the initial two or three to more than thirty. Since the successful handmade manufacture of matches, the Qingfeng branch of the People's Bank, in order to support this undertaking beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, proactively lent 18,000 yuan in October and another 10,000 yuan in November.

　　清丰宏大合作社
  　手工试制火柴成功
    【冀鲁豫电】清丰城内民警宏大合作社手工试制火柴成功。该社原来是消费性的商品合作社，后转向手工业生产。今年十月经工业处国营振兴火柴工厂部分原料及派来干部的帮助，该社负责干部又亲至振兴工厂学习。经全社人员共同研究。建设了蒸房、沾池、铁板、木杆等必要工具，即行开工。经月余经营，现产品已从开始时的每日五十封（即一大箱）增至二百四十封。商标为“宏光”。除售给本城商贩外，并行销东明、濮阳一带。参加造火柴的工人（多是老汉、老婆、儿童等）开始时只二、三人，现已增加到三十多人。该社自手工制造火柴成功后，人民银行清丰支行为了支持这一有利于国计民生的事业，十月间曾主动贷给资金一万八千元，十一月份又贷给资金一万元。
