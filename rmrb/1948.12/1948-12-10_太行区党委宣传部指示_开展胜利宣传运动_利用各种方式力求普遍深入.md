　　Taihang District Party Committee Propaganda Department Issues Instructions
  　Launch a Victory Propaganda Campaign
    Utilizing All Methods to Strive for Universality and Depth
    [Taihang Telegraph] The magnificent victories of the powerful autumn offensive of the People's Liberation Army, and the military commentary by the person in charge of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China that the Kuomintang reactionary government could be fundamentally overthrown in another year or so, have inspired the people of the entire Taihang region. The Propaganda Department of the Taihang District Party Committee has therefore issued instructions, deciding to immediately launch a deep and universal current affairs propaganda campaign throughout the district. It pointed out that all localities must be prepared and systematically celebrate victory and carry out current affairs propaganda universally within a certain period of time. In towns, large villages, and locations of government agencies, victory celebration meetings should be held. In general villages, celebration and propaganda should be carried out in conjunction with various meetings and winter schools. The propaganda should strive for universality and depth. All factories, mines, schools, and government agencies must assist local masses in carrying out celebration and propaganda, and mobilize all propaganda tools as much as possible (such as mass blackboards, radio stations, rural theater troupes, Yangge teams, storytelling teams, shadow plays, slides, murals, etc.), and adopt all methods, such as reports, lectures, seminars, classroom discussions, costumed propaganda speeches, and setting up current affairs exhibition halls, etc., to carry out a relatively systematic and concentrated current affairs education among people of all strata. At the same time, it pointed out that it is necessary to combine the thinking of cadres and the masses to carry out the following propaganda and education: 1. Based on the commentary of the person in charge of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the Chinese military situation, conduct more systematic propaganda and education to the masses. The great victory of the autumn offensive clearly shows that the People's Liberation Army is already powerful enough to seize any large city ruled by the Chiang bandits; and the Chiang bandit army is either being annihilated in large numbers or is rebelling and surrendering. Therefore, in another year or so, the Kuomintang reactionary government can be fundamentally defeated. Any aid from US imperialism will not save it, and it will inevitably perish with it. 2. Expose the various crimes of the Chiang-US reactionaries, and point out that the Liberation War is for the purpose of liberating all the people of the country and establishing an independent, democratic, happy, and prosperous new China. Only by completely defeating the reactionary rule of the Chiang Kai-shek group and winning national victory can the people of the liberated areas consolidate the fruits of their victory and further build our new democratic and happy life. Educate the masses to recognize the close relationship between the Liberation War and themselves, and overcome the erroneous idea of ​​opposing current interests to the anti-Chiang war. 3. We must understand that after the land reform in our district is completed and the landlord class is eliminated, new democracy has been fully realized in the liberated areas, but on a national scale, the revolution has not yet succeeded. We must overthrow Chiang Kai-shek and the Kuomintang, liberate all of China, and only then can new democracy be realized throughout the country. Therefore, we must educate the masses to actively work hard in joining the army, supporting the front, organizing, and various other tasks. Our cadres and party members, after leading the masses to implement land reform, should also lead the masses to implement various new democratic constructions, and more actively support the People's Liberation War until national victory. Therefore, in all work, we must pay attention to implementing this kind of ideological education. In this current affairs propaganda, we must first conduct ideological education within the party, then among the masses, to raise awareness, inspire revolutionary enthusiasm, and the enthusiasm for joining the army and supporting the front.

　　太行区党委宣传部指示
  　开展胜利宣传运动
    利用各种方式力求普遍深入
    【太行电】解放军强大秋季攻势的辉煌胜利，及中共中央负责人关于再有一年即可根本上打倒国民党反动政府的军事评论发出后，太行全区人民无不振奋。太行区党委宣传部为此特发出指示，决定在全区立即开展一个深入的普遍的时事宣传运动。指出各地必须有准备有计划地在一定时间内普遍地庆祝胜利，进行时事宣传。在城镇大村和机关驻地，应举行庆祝胜利大会，在一般村应结合各种会议和冬学，进行庆祝与宣传。宣传要力求普遍深入。一切工厂、矿山、学校、机关都必须协助当地群众进行庆祝宣传，尽可能动员起一切宣传工具（如大众黑板、广播台、农村剧团、秧歌队、鼓书队、洋片、幻灯、壁画等），采取一切方式，如报告、讲演、座谈会、上课讨论、化装宣传演说以及布置时事展览馆等，在各阶层人民中进行一次比较系统的集中的时事教育。同时指出，必须结合干部与群众思想，进行以下的宣传教育：一、根据中共中央负责人对中国军事形势的评论，向群众进行比较系统的宣传教育。从秋季攻势的伟大胜利，就明解放军已经强大到足以夺取任何蒋匪统治的大城市；而蒋匪军则不是大量被歼，就是起义投降，因之，再有一年左右时间，即可从根本上打垮国民党反动政府。美帝国主义的任何援助，都救不了它，而必将随之同归于尽。二、揭露蒋美反动派的种种罪行，指出解放战争是为了解放全国人民，建立独立民主幸福繁荣的新中国的正义目的。解放区的人民，只有彻底打垮蒋介石集团的反动统治，取得全国胜利，才能巩固已得的胜利果实，并进一步建设我们新民主主义的幸福生活。教育群众认识解放战争与他切身的关系，克服把目前利益与反蒋战争对立起来的错误思想。三、必须了解我区土改完成，地主阶级被消灭之后，新民主主义已在解放区完全实现，但在全国范围来说，革命还未成功，必须打倒蒋介石国民党，解放全中国，新民主主义才能在全国实现，因此必须教育群众在参军支前组织起来以及在各种工作中，积极努力。而我们的干部与党员，在带领群众实行了土改之后，还应该带领群众实行各种新民主主义的建设，并更积极地支援人民解放战争直到全国胜利。因之，在一切工作中，都必须注意贯彻这种思想教育。在这次时事宣传中，尤须首先在党内，然后在群众中，进行思想教育，提高觉悟，鼓舞革命热情，和参军支前的积极性。
