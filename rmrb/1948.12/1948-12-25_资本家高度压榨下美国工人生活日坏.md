　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, December 23rd: TASS, New York, December 20th: Although Labor Secretary Tobin admitted in his speech at the AFL convention that the wages of 16 million American workers are 9% lower than the minimum subsistence level, many newspapers and manufacturers are using the current economic decline in the United States as the most favorable condition to intensify the "sweatshop system" (Note: This refers to forcing workers to intensify their labor under meager wages and poor safety and health equipment) and oppose workers' struggles for wage increases. They threaten that raising wages will only lead to a reduction in production and employment. It is said that in order to reduce production costs, manufacturers are particularly demanding to increase labor efficiency. Reuters claims that the struggle against the "sweatshop system" will be one of the main demands of workers for wage increases. The agency said: The intensification of the "sweatshop system" can be manifested in reducing piece-rate wages, increasing productivity, and laying off redundant workers. American workers now produce more than in the past, but receive lower returns for their labor. The agency continued: At the same time, working conditions are getting worse and worse, resulting in a large number of industrial accidents and impairing the health of workers. In industries such as the textile industry, the intensification of the "sweatshop system" has reached the level of so-called technological unemployment (i.e., workers suffer unemployment due to technological improvements). Manufacturers are using the Taft-Hartley Act to oppose the efforts of trade unions to protect their legal rights. For example, union opposition to layoffs caused by the intensification of the "sweatshop system" is declared to be a violation of the Taft-Hartley Act. In many industries, the "sweatshop system" has become increasingly serious. This year, there have been several protest strikes in the steel and automobile industries against the intensification of this system.

　　资本家高度压榨下美国工人生活日坏
    【新华社陕北二十三日电】塔斯社纽约二十日讯：虽然劳工部长托宾在劳联大会演讲中承认，美国有一千六百万工人的工资较最低限度的生活水平低百分之九，但许多报纸与制造业主，则正利用目前美国的经济下降，作为加紧“血汗制度”（按：即在低微工资及恶劣的安全与卫生设备下强迫工人极力加强劳动强度）与反对工人为要求增加工资而斗争的最有利的条件。他们扬言：提高工资只能引向生产与就业的减缩。据说，为了减低生产成本，制造业家们特别要求提高劳动效率。报联社称：反对“血汗制度”的斗争，将是工人增加工资的主要要求之一。该社称：“血汗制度”的加强，可以在减低计件工资率、增加生产率与解雇多余工人中表现出来。美国工人现在较过去生产的更多，但收到的劳动成果较过去为低。该社继称：同时，劳动条件则越来越坏，其结果，发生了大量的工业上的意外事件，并耗损了工人的健康。在象纺织业这一类的工业中，加强“血汗制度”已达到所谓技术失业的程度（按即由于技术改进而使工人遭受失业）。制造业家们应用塔夫脱——哈特莱法，反对职工会保卫他们法定权利的努力。例如：工会反对因加强“血汗制度”而引起的解雇，即被宣布为破坏塔夫脱——哈特莱法。在许多工业中，“血汗制度”已越来越严重了。今年，在钢与汽车工业中，已发生若干次抗议罢工，反对这种制度的加强。
