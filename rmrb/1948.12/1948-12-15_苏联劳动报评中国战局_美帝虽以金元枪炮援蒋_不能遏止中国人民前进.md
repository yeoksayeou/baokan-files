Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, December 6th: TASS, Moscow, December 2nd: The Labor Newspaper published a commentary by Yevgenyev stating: The liberation of Manchuria, the capture of Jinan and Kaifeng, the provincial capitals of Shandong and Henan provinces, and the war being waged at the gates of Nanjing, prove one fact: that the People's Liberation Army is inflicting increasingly devastating blows on the Kuomintang army. The American expansionists, shocked by the disastrous defeat of the Chinese reactionaries' military plans, are rushing to provide aid in the form of money and guns. But all this cannot stop the advance of the Chinese people's national liberation movement. The people have recognized the benefits of the New Democratic system and are unwilling to return to the semi-feudal colonial order, unwilling to return to a state of landlessness, hunger, and poverty. The people yearn to build an independent and democratic China.

    苏联劳动报评中国战局
    美帝虽以金元枪炮援蒋
    不能遏止中国人民前进
    【新华社陕北六日电】据塔斯社莫斯科二日电：劳动报发表叶夫根尼耶夫的评论称：满洲的解放，山东河南两省省会济南与开封的攻克及在南京的门口进行的战争，证明一件事实：即人民解放军正在给国民党军以愈来愈具粉碎性的打击。美国扩张主义者为中国反动派军事计划的惨败所震惊，正在赶送金元与枪炮予以援助。但这一切都不能遏止中国人民的民族解放运动的前进。人民已认识了新民主主义制度的利益，不愿再返回半封建的殖民地的秩序，不愿再返回无土地、饥饿和贫困的状态。人民渴望建立独立与民主的中国。
