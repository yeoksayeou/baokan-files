    Reading the Newspaper Dictionary
    Huaihai Front
    Refers to the front line north of the Huai River, west of the Yellow Sea, south of Shandong, and east of Henan. "Huai" refers to the Huai River, and "Hai" refers to the Yellow Sea. Because this area is very vast, it is not easy to find a suitable name, so this historically customary name is used.
  Soviet
    Translated into Chinese, it means "People's Representatives Assembly." It is the form of administration of the Soviet state, that is, the highest organ of power in the Soviet state (different from the bourgeois parliament in that the Soviet is not only a legislative body, but its Presidium is also the highest administrative organ of the state). Under the principle of protecting complete equality and full freedom of all nationalities and races, the federal and union republics and autonomous republics also have their own supreme soviets.
  Egypt
    Located in northeastern Africa. It is bordered by the Red Sea to the east, the Mediterranean Sea to the north, and the Sahara Desert to the west. It is the center of land, sea, and air transportation between Europe, Asia, and Africa. It is also an important international military strategic location. It is one of the ancient civilizations. Its area is seven times the size of our Hebei Province (Hebei Province is more than 140,000 square kilometers), with a population of more than 15 million. Before World War II, it was invaded by the British Empire. After the war, it was still plundered and oppressed by British and American imperialism, and internally it was also subjected to the exploitation of feudal landlords. Therefore, the lives of the Egyptian people have not improved. But the Egyptian people's anti-imperialist and anti-feudal struggle is developing day by day.
  Nigeria
    Nigeria, Morocco, Tunisia, and Algeria are all in Africa. Nigeria is a British colony; Morocco, Tunisia, and Algeria are occupied by France.
  Dewey
    He is the leader of the American Republican Party. He, Vandenberg, Wheeler, and others are the most famous isolationist reactionaries in the United States. He firmly advocates anti-Sovietism externally and suppresses labor internally. He is a representative of American monopoly capitalists.

    读报辞典
    淮海前线
    是指淮河以北、黄海以西、山东以南、河南以东的战线，“淮”是指淮河，“海”是指黄海。因为这个地区很广阔，不易找一个适当名称，所以才用了这个历史上习惯用的名称。
  苏维埃
    译成中文就是“人民代表会议”的意思。是苏联国家的管理形式，也就是苏联国家的最高权力机关（和资产阶级议会所不同的是苏维埃不单是立法机关，而且其主席团亦为国家的最高行政机关）。在保护各民族与种族完全平等的及充分自由的原则下，联邦和加盟共和国与自治共和国，也各有各的最高苏维埃。
  埃及
    在非洲东北部。东边是红海，地中海在她的北面，西边与撒哈拉大沙漠相连，是欧、亚、非三洲的海陆空交通的中心。也是国际军事战略要地。文明古国之一。其面积为咱们河北省的七倍大（河北省十四万多方公里），人口一千五百多万。第二次世界大战前为英帝国所侵略，战后仍受英美帝国主义的掠夺与压迫，内部又受着封建地主的剥削，因此埃及人民的生活没有得到改善。但埃及人民反帝反封建斗争是日益发展了。
