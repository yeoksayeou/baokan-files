　　Taihang and North Yue Plan to Establish a Student Federation
　　[North Yue Electric] In response to the call of the Liberated Area Youth Federation regarding the establishment of the China Liberated Area Student Federation and the convening of a student conference in February next year, the student unions of Chahar United Middle School, Hebei-Shanxi Middle School, and Zhengding Middle School jointly issued a notice on November 27th: It is proposed that all secondary and higher schools in the region convene the North Yue District Student Representative Conference in January next year. It is explained that the convening of the conference has three purposes: to strengthen student work, to formally establish the North Yue District Student Federation, and to elect representatives to attend the North China Student Representative Conference. Regarding the generation of representatives attending the meeting, it is stipulated that for secondary schools with fewer than 400 people, one representative shall be elected; for those above, two representatives shall be elected. Representatives shall be directly elected by students and should be prepared. Efforts should be made to ensure that outstanding individuals are elected. Regarding the preparatory work before the meeting, the main points are: a general overview of each secondary school, an overview of the student union organization, historical materials of each school, proposals for the North Yue District and North China Student Representative Conferences, the implementation of the new education policy in North China and opinions, and extensive collection of information on student welfare work and student health in secondary and higher schools.
　　[Taihang Electric] The student union of the Sixth Middle School here, in response to the call of the Preparatory Committee of the China Liberated Area Youth Federation, sent letters to various middle schools in the last ten days of last month to initiate the establishment of a preparatory committee to establish a student federation for the entire district. The student unions of various middle schools in the district immediately responded unanimously. Representatives were elected one after another and arrived in Wu'an City, where the Sixth Middle School is located, around the first of this month. The preparatory committee was formally held on the 2nd, with the participation of 17 student representatives from Taihang Public First Middle School, Second Middle School, Third Middle School, Fifth Middle School, Sixth Middle School, Changzhi Normal School, Xingtai Normal School, and Finance and Economics School. (Representatives from the Fourth Middle School and the new district did not arrive due to the distance.)
　　In addition, Director Gong Kuoru of the Administrative Office Education Department, Comrade Yuan Jin of the District Party Committee Propaganda Department, and Comrade Wu Liangpu, representative of the Youth Federation, also came to participate and provide guidance. At the beginning of the meeting, in addition to the initiator reporting on the initiation process, the time and place of the representative meeting, the method of electing representatives, and how to commemorate "December 9th" and "December 16th" were discussed and decided. The results of the discussion decided: (1) The district-wide student conference will be held on January 1st next year, at the Sixth Middle School, and representatives from each school will arrive on the 31st of this month. (2) In principle, one representative will be produced for every 150 people or less, two representatives for every 150 people or more, three representatives for every 250 people or more, and four representatives for every 350 people or more, combined with the "December 9th" commemoration of each school.
