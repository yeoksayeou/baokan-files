　　Ku Klux Klan
　　The original English name is KU-KLUX-KLAN. It was initially a secret society of veterans in the southern United States, founded in 1865, with the purpose of suppressing Protestantism and opposing people of color. The US government ordered it to be banned in 1872. It was revived after the European War. After World War II, it was fostered and directed by capitalists and anti-people reactionaries, becoming an extremely reactionary fascist violent organization.
　　Hatta
　　He is the puppet Prime Minister and pseudo-Defense Minister of the current Indonesian puppet government. He is the leader of the Indonesian Nationalist Party, which represents the interests of the Indonesian princes, nobles, large landlords, and big capitalists. Hatta himself is also a feudal noble landlord. He was educated in the Netherlands in 1921. In 1931, he sold Japanese goods on consignment in Batavia and secretly colluded with Japan. Therefore, after the outbreak of the Pacific War, when the Japanese army occupied Java, he served as the pseudo "Chairman of the National Consultative Council" of Sumatra, and successively served as members of the tariff and constitution committees and other pseudo-positions, becoming the most hated Indonesian traitor by the Indonesian people. Now he has thrown himself into the arms of US imperialism, acting as a running dog and executioner for the US and Dutch imperialists to massacre the people.
　　Blitzkrieg
　　Also known as "lightning war," it was the tactic used by Nazi Germany when launching its European war of aggression against Poland, Norway, the Netherlands, Belgium, France, and other places; the main principle was careful preparation, using high-speed mechanized corps to concentrate and break through the enemy's line.
　　Deficit
　　According to general bookkeeping regulations, if income does not meet expenditure, the amount of the deficit is written in red. Therefore, a deficit in the national budget is called deficit financing.
