Three Thousand Bullets
    ——The Story of Nanguan in Baoding

    I
    On November 16th, when Battalion Commander Deng was taking two signalmen to inspect the fortifications, a merchant in his twenties came out of the yard they were passing and called out, "Comrades, come here, I have something to tell you. I have three sacks of bullets belonging to the big township bully stored at my place. You can take them!" Battalion Commander Deng asked, "Where are they?" The merchant said, "There's a stranger at my place right now. Wait a while and then come back. When you come, just say loudly: 'Are there any enemy contraband military supplies here?' Then I will say, 'Yes, there are things left behind by the big township bully,' and point you to the place. I am from the Fucheng Grain Store." They made an arrangement and went their separate ways. When Battalion Commander Deng returned from inspecting the work, he taught the signalmen the exact words, and they retrieved more than three thousand bullets.

    The soldiers of the fourth squad were busy repairing the fortifications. They didn't have enough earth, so they went to dig in a pit outside the courtyard of the Fuxingyong Flower Shop. After digging a few times, they saw wooden planks and thought it was something buried by the villagers, which they were forbidden from digging up. So they went to another place to dig. After digging four or five baskets, the soldiers shouted, "Squad leader, are we still carrying?" At this time, a master craftsman from Fuxingyong quietly walked up to the squad leader and whispered, "Squad leader, there are plainclothes bullies from the big township in this yard, constantly coming and going. The night you first came, they buried something in this pit!" As he spoke, he led the squad leader to the edge of the pit they had dug before. The soldiers dug and found that seven rifles and three belts of bullets were buried inside.

    During the fierce battle in Nanguan, Baoding, civilians kept fleeing. At that time, an old woman in her fifties, while walking, said to the troops, "Comrades, the one in the long coat in front is from the big township. Call him back!" Officer Wang heard this and hurried up to call the man back, and asked, "You are from the big township, aren't you? Where do you live there?" He said, "Yes, I am an economic officer, and I live in Dongmachi." Officer Wang explained, "Don't be afraid. If you know where the enemy is hiding things here, let us find them." As a result, a box of American-made 7.9mm bullets was dug up in a courtyard on the east side of the road.

    ——保定南关的故事
    一
    十一月十六日，邓营长带着两个通讯员去察看工事的时候，从他们经过的院里，走出了一个二十多岁的商人，喊道：“同志：来，有一个事说给你们，我那儿存着大乡里三麻袋子弹，你们弄去吧！”邓营长说：“在那儿啦？”那商人说：“这会我那儿有一个生人，等过一会你们再去，你们去了就使劲说：“这儿有敌人犯禁的军火没有？”到那时我就说：“有，有大乡撇的东西。”就指给你们地方。我是福成粮栈的。”他们约会好，就各干各的去了。邓营长察看工作回来，把原话教给了那通讯员，就取回来三千多发子弹。

    四班的战士们正在忙着修理工事，土不够，他们就到福兴永花店院外一个土坑里去挖，挖了几下，见有木板，以为是老乡埋的东西，挖出来是犯纪律的，就到另一个地方去挖。挖了四五筐，战士们喊：“班长，还抬不抬呀？”这时福兴永的一个大师傅听见了就悄悄的走到班长跟前，小声说：“班长，这院里有穿便衣的大乡，不断过来过去的，你们头来的那晚上，他们在这土坑里埋东西来！”说着，把班长领到以前挖过的那个土坑边上。战士们一挖，里边原来埋的是七支步枪和三挂子弹。

    保定南关战斗正激烈的时候，不断的逃出老百姓来，当时有一个五十多岁的老大娘，边走边向部队说：“同志们，前边那个穿大袄的，是大乡里的，叫他回来吧！”王干事一听，就赶上去把那人叫了回来，问：“你是大乡的人吧？你们尽在那里住？”他说：“是，我是经济干事，就住在东马池。”王干事解释说：“你别害怕，你要知道这里敌人藏的东西，就让我们找去。”结果在路东一个院里，刨出来一箱美造七九子弹。
