Respect Workers' Opinions, Implement Labor-Capital Benefit
　　Private Non-Profit Cotton Mill Achieves Development
    Since recognizing the democratic government's policy of supporting industry and commerce, and paying attention to improving workers' production enthusiasm, Wei Huaixuan, manager of the private non-profit cotton mill in Zhengding City, has seen rapid development in production in just six months. Wei was originally the manager of Hengmao, the largest merchant in Zhengding. During the enemy and puppet regime's rule, he painstakingly established a cotton weaving factory, but under the oppression of the enemy, puppet regime, and Chiang Kai-shek bandits, it not only failed to develop but eventually closed down. After the first liberation of Zhengding, due to the "leftist" deviation in the implementation of the policy towards industry and commerce at the time, Wei Huaixuan adopted a skeptical and wait-and-see attitude towards our Party's policy. After the rectification of industry and commerce this spring, he believed that the Communist Party truly supported industry and commerce that benefited the national economy and the people's livelihood. With the help of a bank loan of 200,000 yuan (new currency), he organized the Non-Profit Cotton Mill, which officially started operation in early April of this year according to the lunar calendar. When the factory started, there were only eight workers and three technicians; three yarn spinning machines and three small bleaching pools. The factory mainly produced yarn, bandages, and absorbent cotton, which were sold to hospitals and health organizations in Shijiazhuang, Yangquan, and the city. Later, through the introduction of the Zhengding Municipal Government, it was also sold to the Military Region Health Department.
    After the start of operation, the number of workers gradually increased, reaching 25 by the end of August according to the lunar calendar, with eight administrative staff. The number of yarn spinning machines increased to six, and two cotton ginning machines and two winnowing machines were added for self-sufficiency. From April to September according to the lunar calendar, a total of 2,598 pounds of absorbent cotton, 134 dozen bandages, 1,070 pounds of coarse and fine cloth, and 44 dozen wrapping cloths were produced. In addition, there were other products. 31,555 pounds of handmade cloth were also produced. In five months, the capital and profit reached 180,000 yuan, more than eight times the original capital of 22,000 yuan. The profit was more than 15,080 yuan.
    According to Manager Wei, the factory's rapid development was mainly due to the good labor-capital relations, the high production enthusiasm of the workers, and the planned and trustworthy management.
  　I. Apprentice and Shareholder
    Workers and apprentices in the factory can freely invest in shares to become shareholders (1,000 yuan per large share in new currency, 200 yuan per small share). At the time of settlement, 50% of the profit is taken out for dividend distribution according to the shares. This has improved the enthusiasm and responsibility of each worker for production. Manager Wei said: "Now no one in the factory is managing, and everyone is working very hard. Those who violate the rules are discussed and punished by everyone. For example, worker Tian Changshun was dismissed after discussion because he was lazy and did not work properly." Now all the workers and apprentices in the factory have become shareholders, large and small. At the beginning of operation, there were only seven shares, but now it has increased to 110 shares.
  　II. Determining the Wage System According to Workers' Opinions
    In labor-capital relations, the principles of "labor sharing profits" and "wage system" are adopted, and workers' opinions are solicited in advance before making a decision.
    Of the 25 workers, 22 were willing to earn wages in the form of rice. After discussion, it was decided that technical workers would receive 150 jin per month (same as general factories), and apprentices would receive 20 jin per month. At the time of settlement, 10% of the profit would be taken out as bonuses and distributed to everyone after discussion. The labor sharing profit system (including shareholders) involves taking out 40% of the profit at the time of settlement and distributing it in batches after discussion (according to the standards set for technicians, apprentices, labor, and responsibility). However, before the settlement, workers can borrow 70% of the general workers' wage rice (divided into technicians and apprentices) each month to support their families (excluding shareholders). If the factory does not make money, the advance payments borrowed by the workers still belong to the workers, so as not to work for nothing.
    In the settlement of four months, the cook Dong Yaming, who earned wages in the form of rice, did a good job in the meals, and technician Wang Jianwen was responsible and worked hard. After discussion, each received a bonus of 700 yuan. Zhang Chenwen shared profits based on his labor, earning 2,200 yuan in four months. Zhang is a general worker, but because the factory made a large profit, his labor profit sharing exceeded the salary and bonuses of technician Wang Jianwen for four months. After the settlement, the workers were willing to switch to labor profit sharing, dispelling the workers' concerns at the beginning of operation that they would work for nothing if the factory lost money.
    Also, the wages or profit sharing of workers and apprentices are discussed once a month (increased wages or determined shares according to the monthly work situation). Apprentice Zhang Fuxiang could not do anything when he first came, and he learned to spin yarn. At the beginning, he earned 20 jin of wage rice, and in the second month he earned 25 jin, increasing to 40 jin in the fourth month (the same with three or four other people), achieving the goal of evaluating and gradually increasing wages according to the progress of skills and the strength of labor, breaking the feudal system of apprentices having no labor benefits for three years, and encouraging new and old workers to improve their skills and actively produce.
  　III. Everyone Thinks of Ways to Complete Production Ahead of Schedule
    Because the workers are also shareholders and can share profits according to their technical abilities, they can study together to improve technology and accelerate production. The factory holds a full factory meeting every half month to discuss factory work, workers' wages, and how to improve production. At the meeting, workers can put forward positive opinions. For example, technician Wang Jianwen proposed that the packaging was too chaotic in the past and should be divided in a planned way. The factory adopted his suggestion, and after improvement, the same number of people could package more than 500 pounds of absorbent cotton per day, compared to only 400 pounds in the past. The workers also proposed "being trustworthy, having more customers, and completing work ahead of schedule in order to make money." Manager Wei cited an example, saying: "We rely on the workers' high production enthusiasm and planned time to complete production. For example, the Military Region Health Department ordered 4,300 pounds of absorbent cotton last time, and a contract was signed to complete it in 20 days. According to this number, it would not only take 20 days but would also require 40 people to complete. However, we carefully planned and the workers actively produced, and in nine days, 20 workers completed the task, and the quality was good. How could we not make money?"
    Now the factory is developing rapidly, and there is a shortage of housing. The old "City God Temple" is being renovated into a grand factory with 300 rooms. The "main hall" is already filled with 50,000 jin of cotton and 1,600 bundles of yarn recently transported by the military region. The huge task of making 200,000 rolls of paper tape, which will take 40 days, will start in the new factory. The east and west halls are equipped with machine rooms and finished product warehouses, and six large bleaching pool rooms, cotton drying rooms, and worker dormitories have been built, with underground passages for heating. Manager Wei said that after moving to the new factory, the number of workers will increase to 60, and it will be able to drive 40 small workers. There are also plans to set up an oil press. Finally, he said, "Come and see again at the end of the month, and it will be different from today."

　　尊重工人意见贯彻劳资两利
  　私营公益棉厂获发展
    正定市私营公益制棉厂经理魏槐轩自认识了民主政府扶植工商业政策，及注意提高工人生产积极性以后，仅半年工夫，生产得到飞速发展。魏原为正市最大商号恒茂号经理，在敌伪统治时，曾费尽心血建立起棉织工厂，但在敌伪蒋匪的统治压榨下，不惟得不到发展而且终至歇业。正定首次解放后，因当时执行工商业政策曾犯左倾偏向，魏槐轩对我党政策采取怀疑观望态度。及今春经过工商业叫偏后，相信共产党真正扶植有利于国计民生的工商业，于是在银行贷款（新币下同）二十万元的帮助下乃筹组了公益制棉工厂，于今年旧历四月初正式开工。工厂开工时，仅工人八名，技工三人；织纱机子三张，小型漂洗池三个。工厂主要生产是织纱、制绷带、制脱脂棉等。销售于石庄、阳泉及该市的医院卫生机关。后经正市政府介绍，又销售到军区卫生部。
    开工后工人陆续增加，到旧历八月底达二十五人，事务人员八人。织纱机增加到六张，添轧花车二张，风工二张，自弹自用。由旧历四月到九月结算中共出脱脂棉二千五百九十八磅，绷带一百三十四打，粗细纱布一千零七十余磅，包布四十四打，并出手工纱布三万一千五百五十五磅，此外尚有其他出品。五个月工夫，本利达十八万元。超过原有资金二万二千元的八倍强。盈利一万五千零八十余元。
    工厂所以能发展这样迅速，据魏经理谈主要由于劳资关系好，工人生产情绪高，及经营上有计划与有信用。
  　一、是学徒又是股东
    厂里工人、学徒，可以自由入股为股东（每大股新币一千元，小股二百元）。在结帐时由盈利中取出百分之五十按股分红。这样就提高了每个工人生产的积极性与责任心。魏经理说：“现在厂里就没人管都干的挺起劲。不守纪律的，由大家评议处罚，象工人田常顺因挑皮，不好好工作，经评议后，被开除。”现全厂工人、学徒都变成了大小股东，开工时只七个股，现已增加到一百一十个股。
  　二、按工人意见确定工资制
    在劳资关系上采取“劳力分红利”与“工资制”，事先征求工人意见，然后决定。
    二十五名工人中有二十二人愿挣工资米，经议定技术工人每人每月一百五十斤（与一般工厂同），学徒每人每月二十斤。在结帐时由盈利取出百分之十为奖金，经评议分给大家。劳力分红制（股东在内）是在结帐时由盈利中取出百分之四十，经评议按分批红（按技工、学徒、劳动、负责各方面条件为订分标准）。但在未结帐前工人可每月按照一般工人工资米（分技工、学徒）预借七成养家（股东除外）。如工厂不赚钱时，工人预借的仍归工人，以免白干。
    四个月的结帐中，挣工资米的伙夫董雅明在伙食上搞的好，技工王建文负责及劳动好，经评议每人各得七百元奖金。张成文是劳力分红，四个月得二千二百元。张是一般工人，但由于厂里盈利大，他的劳力分红超过了技工王建文四个月的工资再加上奖金。结帐以后，工人们都愿意改成劳力分红。打破了开工时工人怕工厂赔了白干的顾虑。
    又工人、学徒工资或分红，是每月评议一次（按每月工作情况增资或定分）。学徒张福祥初来时什么也不会，学织纱。开头挣工资米二十斤，第二个月即挣二十五斤，到四个月头上增到四十斤（同样的有三四个人），达到了按技术的进步及劳动的强弱来评定，逐渐提高工资，打破了封建制的学徒三年无劳利的制度。鼓励了新老工人提高技术与积极生产。
  　三、大家想办法生产提前完成
    由于工人们自己也是股东，并能按各人技术能力分得红利，因此他们能互相研究提高技术及加速生产。该厂每半月开全厂大会一次，讨论厂里工作、工人工资及如何提高生产等，在会议上，工人都能提出积极意见，如技工王建文提出过去包装太混乱，应当有计划地分工。厂方采纳了他的意见，经过改进后，过去一天仅包脱脂棉四百余磅，现在是同样人数每日能包五百余磅。工人们又提出“讲信用，顾主多，提前完成工作，才能赚钱”。魏经理举例子说：“我们就是靠工人这样高的生产情绪和有计划地凑紧时间完成生产的。如上次军区卫生部定脱脂棉四千三百磅，立下了合同要二十天完成。按这个数字不但得二十天，而且需要得四十人才能完成。但是我们精心计划与工人积极生产，在九天里，二十个工人即完成了，并且质量还好。这样那还有不赚钱的？”
    现该厂因飞速发展，房子已发生恐慌，现正将古旧的“城皇庙”修成三百间房子的规模宏大的工厂。“大殿”上业已装满了最近军区运来的五万斤棉花，一千六百捆纱。制纸带二十万卷，需时四十天的庞大工作将在新厂内开工。东西各殿设机房及成品库房，又修了六个大型漂洗池房、晒棉房及工人宿舍，地下均通火道。魏经理谈：挪到新厂后，工人将增到六十人，并能带动小工四十人。并计划设一榨油机。最后他说：“等月底再来看，和今天就有个不一样了”。
