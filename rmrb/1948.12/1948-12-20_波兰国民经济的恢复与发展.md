　　The Recovery and Development of Poland's National Economy
    By Majiangnuofu
    As is well known, Poland suffered significant losses during World War II. The German invaders murdered over six million Polish residents, destroyed 500,000 industrial and handicraft enterprises, transported 100,000 various machines to Germany, destroyed 800 cities and rural constructions, and damaged 70 to 90 percent of transportation. The number of livestock decreased by 75 percent. The total loss of Poland's national economy amounted to 100 billion pre-war zlotys or 20 billion US dollars.

    If construction were to proceed at the pre-war rate, Poland's economic recovery would take more than fifty years. However, Soviet assistance, socio-economic democratic reforms, and the conscious labor of Polish workers have enabled Poland to recover its economy at an unprecedented pace. Economic recovery is now proceeding according to the 1946-1949 National Economic Plan, passed by the parliament in September 1946.

    The basic task of the Three-Year Plan is to restore the national economy and raise the living standards of Polish workers above the 1938 level. The plan explicitly stipulates raising the living standards of workers, which arises from the fundamental difference between the people's democratic system and the state system that previously existed, representing the interests of the exploiting classes, namely capitalists and landlords. The improvement of people's living standards naturally presupposes the growth of mass consumption levels. The decree issued by the parliament on September 21, 1946, stated: "Throughout the entire period of the plan's implementation, consumption levels should be raised." In accordance with this principle, it was stipulated that Polish agricultural production should increase by 28 percent in 1947, and the output of the food industry should increase by 60 percent. The general index of industrial production in 1947 should reach 67.8 percent of the 1938 level, while the production of consumer goods should reach 85 percent. In 1948, the average consumption level per person will equal the pre-war level, and in 1949 it will exceed the pre-war level.

    The improvement of people's living standards is directly linked to the increase in the proportion of industry in Poland's national economy, and the transformation of the country from an agricultural-industrial nation to an industrial-agricultural nation. According to the Three-Year Plan, the production of industrial goods will increase by one and a half times by the end of 1949 compared to 1938. Coal production will reach 80 million tons in 1949, which is twice the pre-war production level. Iron production will increase from 880,000 tons in 1938 to 1.3 million tons in 1949, steel from 1.44 million tons to 2 million tons, and rolled metal from 1.1 million tons to 1.5 million tons. In 1949, 300 locomotives should be produced (28 in 1938), and 14,800 freight cars (only 560 in 1938).

    The summaries of 1947 and the first few months of 1948 prove that Poland's economic recovery's Three-Year Plan is being successfully implemented. The 1947 plan was fully completed. Coal, metallurgy, metal, timber and power industries, as well as certain sectors such as chemical, electrical, and textile industries, have greatly exceeded the planned output. The 1947 plan for the transportation of goods and passengers was also exceeded.

    One of Poland's basic industrial sectors—the coal industry—has achieved the greatest success. Since the day it was nationalized, it has been advancing along a path of continuous improvement. In 1947, coal production was 59,130,300 tons, or 102.8 percent of the national plan. Polish miners extracted 1,625,000 tons of coal over the plan in 1947, representing 125 percent of the 1946 production. The development of the coal industry not only allows for the full satisfaction of domestic needs but also allows for the export of 17.8 million tons of coal to other countries (compared to only 13,553,000 tons exported in 1946). Coal production continued to grow in 1948. For example, the coal production plan was completed by 107.5 percent in January and 107.2 percent in February.

    The great significance of the coal industry's success is even more evident if we consider that before the war, 70 percent of the entire coal industry was controlled by foreign capitalists, mainly German capitalists, who practiced predatory coal mining, thus undermining the foundations of this industrial sector.

    The achievements of Poland's metallurgical industry are also significant. The Central Administration of the Metallurgical Industry reported to President Bierut that the 1947 plan for the production of steel and rolled products had been completed on December 4th. In 1947, the Polish metallurgical industry reached the 1938 level in rolled products and exceeded the 1938 level in steel production.

    Poland's light industry is successfully completing its plan. The total output of the textile industry in 1947 was 1,656,000,000 zlotys (calculated at the 1937 currency value), completing 101 percent of the annual plan. The sugar industry produced 481,000 tons of sugar in 1947, completing 108.5 percent of the annual plan. This will allow for an increase in sugar consumption this year to above pre-war levels and the export of 50,000 tons of sugar abroad.

    The canning industry is successfully recovering: in 1947, it completed 111 percent of the plan, producing products worth 41,513,000 zlotys (compared to products worth 27,893,000 zlotys in 1946).

    Poland's ports have almost completely recovered. The largest seaport, Gdansk, completed 110 percent of its loading plan.

    Thus, industry, transportation, and shipping successfully completed the plans for 1947 and the first few months of 1948.

    Polish workers are waging a vigorous struggle to restore their agriculture. In the autumn plowing of 1947 alone, 5,593,000 hectares of land were sown (33 percent of all arable land). Now 90 percent of the land is being used for cultivation, and the remaining portion of vacant land will be sown this year. The reclamation of wasteland is mainly related to the resettlement of Poles in the western regions. The funds allocated by the Land Repatriation Office this year, in the province of Olsztyn alone, amounted to 97,550,000 zlotys, 90 percent of which is intended to assist individual agricultural economies. To achieve agricultural electrification, the Polish government allocated 200 million zlotys, enabling 1,213 Polish villages to be electrified. Tractor stations have been established to assist farmers who have no traction power.

    The labor competition of Polish workers plays a constant leading role in the victorious completion of the Three-Year Plan. This movement, spontaneously arising among the working masses, demonstrates the new conscious attitude of workers towards labor in the new democratic country. Labor competition is developing vigorously in all sectors of Poland's national economy, especially in the coal industry. In September 1947, 1,600 coal miners completed 180 percent of the standard, and in December, there were already 23,447 such coal miners. This March, the number of competitors increased to 35,000. While successfully completing and exceeding the plan, coal miners are competing with textile workers and metallurgical workers.

    Soviet economic assistance—which is based on the selfless and friendly relations between two peace-loving countries—has had a particularly great and beneficial impact on the development of Poland's national economy. Unlike the American "aid" of the Marshall Plan, the Soviet Union not only does not undermine Poland's sovereignty but also promotes the consolidation of Polish sovereignty. The Soviet Union provides Poland with significant assistance in the form of food, grain seeds, textile raw materials, metallurgical raw materials and other industrial raw materials, fuel and liquid fuel, tractors, and agricultural machinery, which Poland urgently needs. The Soviet Union has transferred 15 percent of its reparations taken from Germany to Poland in the form of industrial equipment. The Soviet Union also satisfied the Polish government's request to lend him a large number of metals. According to the agreement signed between the Soviet and Polish governments this January, the Soviet Union is helping Poland with grain and industrial equipment in 1948, and with industrial equipment helping Poland is building the "New Huta" metallurgical factory, which has a larger production capacity than all of Poland's current metallurgical enterprises.

    The Polish people are mobilizing domestic resources and utilizing the assistance of the Soviet Union and other democratic countries to realize the great plan of restoring and developing the motherland's economy. The Polish people are responding to the conspiracies of the war provocateurs by successfully completing the Three-Year Plan.

　　波兰国民经济的恢复与发展
    马尔疆诺夫  作
    众所周知，波兰在第二次世界大战时期蒙受了重大的损失。德寇杀害了六百余万波兰居民，消灭了五十万个工业与手工业企业，把十万架各种各样的机器运往德国，破坏了八百个城市与农村建设，破坏了百分之七十至九十的运输交通。家畜的头数减少了百分之七十五。波兰国民经济的损失总额达一千亿战前波币或二百亿美元。
    如果以战前的速度来进行建设，则波兰的经济恢复需要五十余年的时间。但苏联的帮助，社会经济的民主改革与波兰劳动者的自觉劳动，使波兰实际上能够以该国空前的速度来恢复经济。经济恢复现在正按照国会于一九四六年九月所通过的一九四六——一九四九年国民经济计划而进行着。
    三年计划的基本任务，就是恢复国民经济，提高波兰劳动者的生活水平至一九三八年水平以上。计划规定确切提高劳动者的生活水平，乃是由人民民主制度与从前存在过的代表剥削阶级利益代表资本家地主利益的国家制度之间的原则差别所产生的。人民生活水平的提高，自然，预定着群众消费水平的增长。国会在一九四六年九月二十一日所颁布的法令中说：“在执行计划的整个时期内，消费水平都应当提高起来。”根据这个方针，规定一九四七年波兰农产品增加百分之二十八，食品工业产量提高百分之六十。一九四七年工业生产的一般指数应达一九三八年水平的百分之六十七·八，而消费品的生产则达百分之八十五。一九四八年，按每个人计算的平均消费水平将等于战前水平，而在一九四九年将超过战前水平。
    人民生活水平的提高，是与波兰国民经济中工业比重的增加，与国家自农业——工业国变成工业——农业国，直接联系着的。而根据三年计划，工业品的生产迄一九四九年末将较一九三八年增加一倍半。石炭采量于一九四九年将达八千万吨，即较战前开采水平提高两倍。铣铁的生产将自一九三八年的八十八万吨增至一九四九年的一百三十万吨，钢——自一百四十四万吨增至二百万吨，压延金属——自一百十万吨增至一百五十万吨。在一九四九年应当出产三百个机关车（一九三八年为二十八个），一万四千八百辆货车（一九三八年只有五百六十辆）。
    一九四七年和一九四八年头几个月的总结，证明波兰经济恢复的三年计划正在被成功地执行着。一九四七年的计划全部完成了。煤炭、冶金、金属、木材与动力工业，以及某些部门如化学、电气、纺织工业等，都大大超过了计划规定的产量。一九四七年货物与旅客运输的计划也被超过了。
    波兰基本工业部门之一——煤炭工业，达到了最大的成功。自国有化那天起，它就沿着不断提高的道路前进。一九四七年的石炭开采量为五千九百十三万三百吨，即达国家计划的百分之一○二·八。波兰矿工在一九四七年开采的煤炭超过计划一百六十二万五千吨，为一九四六年开采量的百分之一二五。煤炭工业的发展，不但允许完全满足国内的需要，而且可以输出一千七百八十万吨煤炭至别的国家（一九四六年之输出量仅为一千三百五十五万三千吨）。煤炭采量在一九四八年也继续增长。例如一月份就完成了煤炭开采计划的百分之一○七·五，二月份完成了百分一○七·二。
    煤炭工业成功的巨大意义是更为明显的，如果我们考虑到，战前全部煤炭工业的百分之七十，曾被掌握在外国资本家手里，主要的是在德国资本家手里，他们实行掠夺性的煤炭开采，因而破坏了这个工业部门的基础。
    波兰冶金业的成绩也是巨大的。冶金工业中央管理局在给贝鲁特总统的报告中说，一九四七年关于出产钢和压延制品的计划已于十二月四日完成。一九四七年的波兰冶金业在压延制品方面到达了一九三八年的水平，在钢的出产方面超过了一九三八年水平。
    波兰的轻工业正在成功地完成计划。纺织工业在一九四七年的产量总额为十六万万五千六百万波币（按一九三七年的币值计算），完成了本年计划的百分之一○一。制糖工业在一九四七年生产了四十八万一千吨砂糖，完成了本年计划的百分之一○八·五。这使今年就能增加砂糖的消费至超过战前的水平，并把五万吨砂糖输出国外。
    罐头工业正在成功地恢复着：在一九四七年完成了计划的百分之一一一，生产了四千一百五十一万三千波币的产品（一九四六年的产品值二千七百八十九万三千波币）。
    波兰的港口几乎完全恢复起来了。最大的海港格当斯克完成了装载计划的百分之一一○。
    这样，工业、运输与航行成功地完成了一九四七年和一九四八年最初几个月的计划。
    波兰劳动者为恢复自己的农业而进行着强力的斗争。仅在一九四七年秋耕中就播种了五百五十九万三千公顷土地（全部耕地的百分之卅三）。现在用于耕种的土地已有百分之九十，余下最后的一部分空地亦将于今年播种完毕。荒地的垦植主要与波兰人移居西部地区有关。土地再归部今年所分配的资金，仅奥尔石登斯克一省就得到了九万七千五百五十万波币，其中百分之九十是预定用来帮助个体农业经济的。为了做到农业电气化，波兰政府拿出了二百万万波币，使一千二百十三个波兰乡村能够电气化。建立了拖拉机站以帮助完全没有曳引力的农户。
    波兰工人的劳动竞赛在三年计划的胜利完成中起着经常领导的作用。这个在工人群众中自发起来的运动，证明了新民主国家内工人对于劳动的新的自觉的态度。劳动竞赛在波兰国民经济的一切部门，尤其是在煤炭工业部门中猛烈发展着。一九四七年九月，一千六百名炭坑夫完成了标准的百分之一八○，而在十二月，这样的炭坑夫已经有二万三千四百四十七人。今年三月，竞赛者的人数增至三万五千个。炭坑夫在成功地完成和超过计划时，正与纺织工人和冶金工人进行竞赛。
    苏联的经济援助——这是建立在两个爱好和平国家间的无私与友好关系基础上的——对于波兰国民经济的发展特别有着巨大的良好影响。苏联与马歇尔计划的美国“援助”不同，不但丝毫没有破坏波兰的主权，并且促进波兰主权的巩固。苏联以供给波兰粮食、谷种、纺织原料、冶金原料及其他工业原料、燃料与液体燃料、拖拉机与波兰极为需要的农业机等形式，给予波兰巨大的帮助。苏联将其取自德国的赔偿部分，以工业设备的形式让给波兰百分之十五。苏联也满足了波兰政府关于贷给他大批金属的请求。按照今年一月苏波两国政府间所缔结的协定，苏联在一九四八年正以谷物与工业设备帮助波兰，并以工业设备帮助波兰正在建筑中的“新呼塔”大冶金工厂，该厂每年的生产率不亚于波兰现有全部冶金企业的生产率。
    波兰人民正在动员国内的资源与利用苏联及其他民主国家的援助，实现恢复与发展祖国经济的伟大计划。波兰人民正在以成功地完成三年计划来回答战争挑拨者的阴谋。
