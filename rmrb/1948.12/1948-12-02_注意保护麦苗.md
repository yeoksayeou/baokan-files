　　Pay Attention to Protecting Wheat Seedlings
    Now that winter has arrived, the ground is frozen and the grass is withered. Some shepherds graze their sheep on other people's wheat seedlings in winter. This not only eats the seedlings, but also easily bites out the roots of the seedlings that have not been watered before freezing. This will greatly affect the wheat harvest next year. Although this fattens the sheep and benefits animal husbandry, it is extremely harmful to agricultural production. I suggest that local governments issue a clear prohibition and inform individual shepherds that those who graze on wheat seedlings will be dealt with accordingly, and mobilize the masses to implement supervision. Calling on everyone to protect this winter's wheat seedlings is the only way to guarantee next year's wheat harvest.　Xingtang Second District, Zi Wenzhong
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    (Note from the Agricultural Department of the North China People's Government: In areas such as Baiyangdian and other lakeshores, the land is fertile and the seedlings are lush. After the ground freezes, there is a habit of grazing livestock. The masses believe that after the livestock eat the seedlings, the seedlings will flourish even more, and they don't pay attention to it. However, grazing sheep is generally opposed, because sheep have small, pointed mouths, and each bite takes only a few roots, often deep to the roots, or even bites them up completely. It must be prohibited.)

　　注意保护麦苗
    现在到了冬天，地冻草枯，个别的放羊人，往往在冬天放人家的麦苗，不但把麦苗吃掉，而且没上冻水的麦苗，很容易连根咬出来，明年麦子收获很受影响。这样虽然把羊喂得肥胖，有益畜牧，但对农业生产上妨害极大。我建议各地政府明令禁止，晓谕个别放羊人，如有放麦苗者，定给以相当处理，并动员群众实行监督。号召大家保护今冬的麦苗，才能保证明年的麦收。　行唐二区字文中
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    （华北人民政府农业部按：在如白洋淀以及其他湖泽边沿地方，地肥苗旺，地冻后有放饲牲口习惯，群众认为经过牲口吃，苗反发旺，并不置意，唯对于放羊，一般是反对的，因羊嘴尖小，每口掇食数根，往往深达根部，或竟连根咬起。必须禁止。）
