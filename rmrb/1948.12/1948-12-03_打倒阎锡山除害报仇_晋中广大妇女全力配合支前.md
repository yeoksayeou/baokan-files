　　[Jinzhong Telegram] The broad masses of women in the new and old liberated areas of Jinzhong are fully cooperating with the men to support the front, undertaking various war service tasks in the rear. According to reports from correspondents in various places, women have contributed great strength in supporting the front, ensuring various supplies for the front. In Taigu, large numbers of men have gone to support the front, and the tasks of autumn storage, grinding military flour, accommodating the wounded, and short-distance grain transportation in the rear are all undertaken by women. More than 400 women in the seventh and eighth districts ground more than 40,000 jin of public grain and organized themselves to personally send it to the warehouse, ensuring a steady supply of grain to the front. Women in Yangyi Village alone transported more than 1,000 jin of public grain to Chengguan. In addition, women in various villages are stepping up grinding flour day and night to supply the troops. In Chengjiazhuang, Nianzhuang, and Shuixiu in the eighth district, Litucun in the fourth district, and Yangyi in the sixth district, 790 women participated in grinding flour, grinding 99,425 jin of flour in ten days. They grind in organized and led shifts, with people resting but the mill not, which is fast and does not hinder other work. Especially in Chengjiazhuang, the planning and organization are very thorough, and 19,500 jin of flour were ground in four days. At the same time, the transit stations and reception centers along the way are all staffed by large numbers of women undertaking transportation and care work. They firmly believe that only by eliminating Yan Xishan can they live well. Women in Shouyang, Pingding, and other counties had already combined production with support for the front during the autumn harvest and autumn plowing, organizing large numbers of women and children to replace men in various production and support tasks in the rear. In Nanchang Village, Tenth District, Shouyang, where all the men had gone to the front, more than 30 women in the village, led by Zhang Xiuhua, chairman of the Women's Rescue Association, organized plowing, plowing and sowing together, and could cultivate seven mu of land in one day. Wang Sanniu, the leader of the women's production model group in Hanhua, Thirteenth District, led the entire group to undertake the overall work of autumn harvest, threshing, and autumn plowing, and organized competitions to consolidate and improve women's production confidence. After the women and children in the ninth district had just transported 180,000 jin of public grain, they were then allocated 35,000 jin, and all the women, children, and old men in the district were mobilized and completed it in two days. They said, "We will complete the task without discount, and we have a share in attacking Taiyuan!" This shows their extreme hatred for the Yan bandits and their determination to support the capture of Taiyuan. Zhao Erdan, a woman with bound feet in Yanjia Village, Twelfth District, automatically sent grass to a place more than 20 li away, carrying more than 20 jin each time, continuously sending it. She said, "This is to fight Yan Xishan, everyone has a task. Last year, Yan Xishan drove me to Nanpao and starved for a year. I finally waited until today." Women in Xisongbi and other villages in Jiexiu automatically organized themselves to sew and mend clothes for the participating migrant workers when they saw that their clothes were torn. Women in Zhangliangli Village and other villages organized themselves to help migrant workers' families solve their difficulties door-to-door. In particular, women cadres in various villages played a leading role in supporting the front. For example, Song Yumei of Zhongguandi Village, Eighth District, Pingyao, organized women and children aged 18 to 45 in the entire village to grind flour for the front, and sent men to support the front and work in the fields.

　　打倒阎锡山除害报仇
  　晋中广大妇女全力配合支前
    【晋中电】晋中新老区广大妇女，全力配合男人支援前线，担任后方各种战勤工作。据各地通讯员报导：妇女在支前工作中，贡献了极大力量，保证着前方的各种供应。太谷各村大批男人都去支前了，后方的秋屯、磨军面、招待伤员以及短距离运粮等工作，都由妇女担任起来。七区与八区四百多妇女，将四万余斤公粮碾好，又组织起来亲自送至仓库，保证前方粮食源源接济。仅阳邑村妇女即向城关运送公粮千余斤。此外，各村妇女都日以继夜的加紧磨面，供给部队。八区的程家庄、年冢庄、水秀，四区的李秃村，六区的阳邑等村，妇女参加磨面的达七百九十人，十天内磨面九万九千四百二十五斤。她们有组织、有领导地轮流换班磨，人歇磨不歇，既快又不妨碍其他工作。特别是程家庄，计划组织都很周到，四天即磨面一万九千五百斤。同时，沿路的转运站与招待所，都是大批妇女在担任转运与看护工作。她们确信只有消灭了阎锡山，才能好活。寿阳、平定等县妇女，早在秋收秋耕中即使生产与支前结合起来，组织了广大妇女和儿童代替男人在后方的各种生产和支前任务。寿阳十区南昌村，男人都到前方去了，全村三十多个妇女，由妇救会主席张秀花领导，组织刨地，连刨带种，一天即可耕种七亩地。十三区韩花妇女生产模范组长王三妞，领导全组担任了秋收、打场、秋耕的全盘工作，并组织竞赛，巩固与提高了妇女们的生产信心。九区的妇女儿童刚运完十八万斤公粮后，接着又分配下来三万五千斤，全区妇女、儿童、老汉总动员，两天又完成了。她们说：“不打折扣完成任务，打太原有咱的份！”表现了她们对阎匪的极其仇恨，和坚决支持打下太原的决心。十二区阎家屯妇女赵二旦，是个小脚，但她也自动的向二十里以外送草，每次背二十几斤，接连不断的送。她说：“这是打阎锡山，人人有任务。去年阎锡山把我赶到南咆饿了一年，好容易才盼到今天。”平定妇女在担任后方生产中，积极的学习生产技术。如九区七亘村妇女干部王翠妮，在秋耕中将妇女组织好，每组配备几个有经验的男人领导学习，因而逐步提高劳动效率和积极性，白天上地，黑夜还切晒干菜。同时，她们也同样的担任着各种直接支前的艰巨任务。如十二区的高脑庄、连庄等十三个村，一千零三十四个妇女，运送了五万零七百斤公粮。五区八百三十四个妇女与儿童参加运粮，一次即运了二万五千斤。苇池村全村只有五盘碾，妇女们便星夜碾公粮。所有妇女在支前中的伟大行动与成绩，对巩固前方部队与民工情绪直接起了保证与鼓舞作用。寿阳四区五填脑军属李润花，担任了该村的支前生产保证组长，除组织了人力物力供应前方外，并动员逃回的民工归队。她都是这样说服别人的：“咱们要从长期利益打算，你忘记了去年敌人‘水漫’咱们，全村人都转移出去，衣服粮食全被抢光，吃了一年糠菜的苦吗？现在打太原，就是给咱们打的，你快去吧！”介休西宋壁等村妇女，看到参战民工的衣服破了，便自动组织起来给民工缝补。张良里屯等村妇女，组织起来挨门帮助民工家庭解决困难。特别是各村妇女干部，在支前中起了带头模范作用。如平遥八区的中官地村宋玉梅，组织了全村十八至四十五岁的妇女和儿童，给前方磨面，抽出男人支前和上地。
