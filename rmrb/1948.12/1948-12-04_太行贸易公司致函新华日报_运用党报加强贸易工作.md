Taihang Trading Company Sends Letter to Xinhua Daily
    Utilizing Party Newspaper to Strengthen Trade Work
    [Taihang Telegraph] In order to further promote and guide the work, the Taihang Trading Company has specifically proposed to closely connect with Party newspapers and strengthen communication and reporting work. The company's letter to the Taihang Xinhua Daily stated: "Taihang trade work has achieved many successes, but in the past, we have not systematically summarized and reported them in a timely manner. For example, during the winter and spring relief production organized by the First Branch, it adjusted 40 million jin of grain, 1.5 million jin of cotton, and collected 32.2 million square feet of cloth in just half a year, cooperating with local work to help the people in the disaster areas of the First and Second Districts overcome the famine through production and self-salvation. Secondly, the trade in the Second, Third, and Fifth Districts, in conjunction with support for the front, adjusted local prices and ensured the supply of non-staple food to the war zone. The Fourth District organized the production and sales of Huai goods (medicinal materials, etc.), opened up trade routes with western Henan, adjusted 2 million jin of salt, and stabilized salt prices in Taihang. In addition, the First Branch also organized and restored the production of Quxian jujubes in western Hebei, which had been ruled by Japanese invaders and Chiang Kai-shek bandits for more than ten years, and opened up the sales of the famous Guanzhuang native cloth in Neiqiu County. The above achievements, especially the work experience, have not been summarized and reported in a timely manner due to our lack of skill and habit in summarizing, which has prevented us from exchanging experiences with each other and improving the level of economic workers. As a result, some comrades have developed the illusion that 'economic departments are not as good as doing local work.' In the future, trade work should strengthen political and ideological leadership. To this end, it is necessary to strengthen communication work, study Party newspapers, and improve the cultural and theoretical level of cadres."

　　太行贸易公司致函新华日报
    运用党报加强贸易工作
    【太行电】太行贸易公司，为进一步推动与指导工作，并特提出密切党报联系，加强通讯报导工作。该公司函太行新华日报称：“太行贸易工作有很多成绩，但过去我们没有系统的总结与及时的反映过。如一分公司在去冬今春组织生产救灾中，仅半年中曾调剂粮食四千万斤，棉花一百五十万斤，收布三千二百余万方尺，配合地方工作，使一、二分区灾区群众在生产自救中渡过了灾荒。其次，象二、三、五分区的贸易，结合支前工作调剂了地方物价，保证了战地副食品的供给。四分区组织怀货（药材等）、产销，打通与豫西的贸易路线，调剂了二百万斤食盐，稳定了太行盐价。此外一分公司还组织与恢复了曾被日寇与蒋匪统治十数年的冀西曲枣生产，并打开了有名的内邱县官庄土布的销路。以上这些成绩，特别是工作经验，由于我们不善于和不习惯于总结，因此也未及时的报导，互相交流经验，使从事经济工作的干部提高一步。因之，一部分同志思想上产生了‘经济部门不如作地方工作好’的错觉。今后贸易工作应加强政治领导与思想领导，为此，就必须加强通讯工作，学习党报，提高干部的文化理论水平。”
