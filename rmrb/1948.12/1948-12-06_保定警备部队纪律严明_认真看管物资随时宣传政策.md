　　Baoding Garrison Troops Have Strict Discipline;
　  Carefully Guard Supplies and Constantly Promote Policies
    [Baoding Electric Dispatch] After our army's garrison troops and cadres entered Baoding City, they strictly adhered to the entry-city discipline. All organs and troops were stationed in public places, without entering commercial households or private residences without reason. Many cadres did not bring quilts, so they slept in their clothes, and no one used the bedding on the bed boards. All units cooked their meals outside the city and delivered them to the city. Before the currency exchange rate was determined, everyone refrained from buying things to avoid causing losses to merchants. The troops guarding various warehouses were conscientious and responsible, ensuring that the guarded supplies suffered no further losses, and no one used them casually. The Fourth Company of the Battlefield Department guarded three warehouses. The soldiers slept on the ground, but did not use anything. Only after permission from the headquarters did they borrow three cloth overcoats. The sentries at each street intersection and city gate were not only conscientiously responsible for checking pedestrians, but also constantly carried out propaganda and greetings. The citizens deeply felt the strict discipline of the People's Liberation Army, and some voluntarily boiled water for them to drink. Some soldiers wrote "Strict Discipline, Eight Points of Attention" at their posts to facilitate constant self-inspection. The sanitary team immediately took charge of the cabbage discarded by the enemy and reported it to their superiors.

　　保定警备部队纪律严明
　  认真看管物资随时宣传政策
    【保定电】我军警备部队及干部进入保定市后，很好的遵守了入城纪律。机关部队均驻在公共场所，不无故进入商户或民宅。好多干部没带被子，就穿着衣服睡觉，没有一个人动用铺板上的被褥。各单位都在城外做好了饭，送到城内。在货币比价没有规定前，大家都不购买东西，以免使商人吃亏。看管各种仓库的部队，都认真负责，使看管起来的物资，没有再受损失，没有一个人随便动用。战场部四连看管三个仓库，战士们睡在地上，却不动用一点东西，后经指挥部允许，才借用了三个布大衣。各街口与城门上的岗哨人员，不仅切实负责检查行人，且随时进行宣传慰问。市民深感解放军的纪律严明，有的自动给烧开水喝。有的战士在自己的岗位上书写：“严明纪律八项注意”，以便随时检查。卫生队见到敌人扔下的白菜，立即自动看管起来，并报告上级。
