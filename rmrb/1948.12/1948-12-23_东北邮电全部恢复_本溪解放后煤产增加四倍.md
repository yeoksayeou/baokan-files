Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, December 21st: Under the leadership of the Northeast Postal and Telecommunications Administration and with the active efforts of all employees, the postal and telecommunications services in Northeast China have been fully restored, and north-south lines are open. Before Changchun was liberated, the Postal and Telecommunications Administration dispatched an engineering team on October 4th to rush to repair the Harbin-Changchun line. Braving enemy aircraft bombing and strafing, the engineering team launched a surprise line laying effort. On the 19th, Changchun Railway Station was able to communicate with Harbin. After Changchun and Changchun cities were liberated, all employees from Harbin went to the city and completed military and government communications inside and outside the city on the same day. The post office also began to handle mail and distribute newspapers on the 22nd. Subsequently, with the assistance of the Jilin Administration, the engineering team rushed to repair the line between Changchun and Siping. At the same time, the Liaobei Administration organized an engineering team to rush to repair the line between Siping and Shenyang; the Andong Administration also cooperated in rushing to repair the line between Andong and Shenyang. After Shenyang was liberated, thanks to the unity and active repair work of new and old employees, telephone service inside and outside Shenyang was fully restored on November 4th. On November 25th, telegram service in Shenyang was open to all parts of North and South Manchuria. On December 9th, long-distance telephone calls between Shenyang and Changchun, Shenyang and Harbin, and Shenyang and Andong were all completed. The test call between Shenyang via Harbin and Jiamusi was also successful, and the sound was clear. At present, there are 403 telegraph and telephone bureaus in the entire Northeast. There are 1,571 post offices. Now the post offices in various places are establishing various systems, strengthening learning, and striving to improve their political consciousness and professional skills, and working hard to establish the postal and telecommunications cause of the new China.

Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, December 18th: Since the liberation of Benxi, a famous coal and iron industrial city, significant progress has been made in various construction projects. The daily coal output of the Benxi Coal and Iron Company has increased from 280 tons at the initial takeover to 1,181 tons. This output is 24 percent higher than the highest output of 950 tons during the Kuomintang rule. The Benxi Cement Company has also resumed work. The number of factories and shops opened in the city has exceeded the number during the Kuomintang rule. Three middle schools in the city have resumed classes, and the number of students has increased by 50 percent compared to before the recovery. The number of students in primary schools has also increased by one-third to one-half. In order to solve the living difficulties of workers and public employees in the early days of the recovery, the People's Government allocated 20 catties of relief grain to each of them, and also advanced 150,000 yuan in wages to the workers and 30 catties of grain to the public employees. The city's public security is also very stable. The military control committee has taken in more than 300 scattered captives of the Chiang Kai-shek army. More than 800 registered Kuomintang members, from the county party secretary downwards. More than 400 reactionary armed forces, such as the former Chiang bandits' "Homecoming Corps," surrendered to the People's Government with all their weapons on November 5.
