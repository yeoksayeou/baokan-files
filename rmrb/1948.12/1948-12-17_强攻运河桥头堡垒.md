　　Storming the Canal Bridgehead Fortress

　　At the beginning of the Huaihai Campaign, Huang Botao's army corps, as the eastern wing of the Chiang bandit's Xuzhou forces, fled west in a panic across the canal railway bridge, leaving the 44th Division of the 100th Army to defend the bridgehead fortress, dreaming of blocking the People's Liberation Army's pursuit and annihilation.

　　On the evening of the 9th, the People's Liberation Army had arrived at the edge of the canal. A certain regiment, enduring hunger and fatigue, after an eighty-li forced march, suddenly appeared near the barracks at the canal bridgehead. In the barracks on the east bank of the river, fleeing enemies who had plundered the masses were slaughtering pigs and chickens, feasting and making a great commotion. Qi (surname), deputy political instructor of a certain company, led the entire company of soldiers to quietly enter the enemy's barracks, and then launched an attack on the fleeing bandits in the barracks. A burst of bombs and machine guns threw the enemy into chaos. Deputy Political Instructor Qi then led the soldiers of the Eighth Squad to shout: "The People's Liberation Army treats prisoners leniently, those who lay down their arms will not be killed!" All of the more than two hundred enemies in the entire barracks surrendered their weapons.

　　At this time, Battalion Commander Zhu Maofa led the Third Company to cut towards the bridgehead, where a group of enemies were scurrying back and forth on the railway. The "Hero Zhang Shenghuai Platoon," led by Platoon Leader Wang De'en, immediately charged towards the enemy. Machine Gun Shooting Model Zhu Guanghua's machine gun fire brought down the enemy one after another. Our army then penetrated deep into the enemy's lines and shouted to the enemy: "There's nowhere to run, don't die for Chiang Kai-shek!" "Those who lay down their arms will not be killed!" The enemy's deputy battalion commander immediately raised his hand and presented an American pistol to soldier Zhou Shuichi, and shouted to his subordinates: "Quick, put down your guns, don't fight!" An enemy infantry company and a heavy machine gun company also laid down their arms.

　　Two group fortresses were also distributed on both sides of the east end of the railway bridge, with more than a thousand Chiang bandits crowded in several trenches. After capturing a large number of prisoners and weapons, the "Zhang Shenghuai Platoon" immediately rushed to the railway bridge to attack the group fortress on the north side. Soldiers Niu Yangyu and Hu Zhihai rushed towards the enemy bunker with explosives, but Niu Yangyu gloriously sacrificed himself halfway. Hu Zhihai was wounded in one eye, and soldier Wang Changhong immediately rushed up, picked up the explosives, and continued to complete the blasting mission. At this time, the enemy launched a dense grenade counterattack. Deputy Platoon Leader Sun Zhaogui took the machine gun and swept away the enemy's counterattack. Platoon Leader Wang De'en, Second Squad Leader Qin Yuantang, and soldier Pang Fangxun immediately rushed into the bunker. Platoon Leader Wang stuffed a grenade into the bunker, and the enemy immediately scattered in panic. Platoon Leader Wang shot down two enemies in a row, and Second Squad Leader Qin Yuantang swept across with his submachine gun, knocking down another seven or eight enemies. At this time, Deputy Squad Leader Chen Han of the First Squad maneuvered with a group to rush to the red bunker, and machine guns and bombs were immediately fired and thrown at the counterattacking enemy group like hail.

　　That night, the "Li Gan Platoon," led by heroic Company Commander Zhang Xichun, rushed to the last group bunker of the enemy on the right side of the bridgehead, repelled two fierce counterattacks by the enemy in succession, and held the gained position. At dawn, the brave soldiers began to storm, Seventh Squad Leader Liu Zheng led the entire squad, advancing while fighting, first rushed through a flat open space, occupied the breakthrough, and then soldiers He Peiren, Shi Zhuanglin, and Deputy Squad Leader Zhao Tianhong rushed over together.

　　The dying enemy still attempted to counterattack. He Peiren's grenade accurately hit the counterattacking enemy group. The four brave men used the newly captured machine guns and submachine guns to meet the enemy, and grenades exploded one by one in the enemy group, crushing two fierce counterattacks by the enemy, compressing more than a thousand enemies into the fortifications. The four brave men stood firm at the breakthrough like Mount Tai. At this time, our follow-up troops rushed up one after another. The four brave men immediately followed and advanced into the group of fortresses, causing the enemy to collapse and flee towards the river bank. After a round of fighting, the brave men launched a political offensive, and the remaining enemies laid down their weapons.

　　As the rising sun rose in the east, the People's Liberation Army crossed the canal railway bridge and continued to pursue westward.

　　强攻运河桥头堡垒
    淮海战役刚开始，作为蒋匪徐州东翼的黄伯韬兵团，狼狈夺路越运河铁桥西逃，留下了一百军四十四师据守桥头堡垒，梦想拦阻解放军的追歼。
    九日傍晚，解放军已赶到运河边，某团忍饥耐劳，经过八十里强行军，突然出现在运河桥头营房附近。河东岸的营房里抢掠了群众的溃敌正在杀猪宰鸡，大吃大闹。某连副政指丌（音基，姓）习明首先带领全连战士悄悄地进入敌人营房，然后对营房里的溃匪发起攻击，一阵炸弹机枪，敌人慌乱成一团。丌副政指这时又领导八班战士又进行喊话：“解放军宽待俘虏，缴枪不杀！”全营房二百多名敌人，全部缴枪投降。
    这时候，营长朱茂发带领三连插向桥头，一群敌人正在铁路上来回乱窜。“英雄张圣怀排”在排长王德恩带领下立即冲向敌人，射击模范朱光化的机枪射得敌人纷纷倒下。我军随即插入敌人纵深，并向敌人高喊：“没处跑了，不要替蒋介石送死了！”“缴枪不杀！”敌人的副营长马上举起手来把一支美国手枪呈交给战士周水池，并向他的部下喊道：“快放下枪来，不要打了！”敌人一个步兵连，一个重机枪连也全部放下武器。
    铁桥东头两侧还分布着两个集团堡垒，千余蒋匪拥挤在几条壕沟里。“张圣怀排”在俘获大批俘虏、武器后，立即冲向铁桥，攻击北侧的集团堡垒。战士牛养玉和胡芝海抱着炸药向敌堡冲去，但牛养玉在半途中光荣牺牲了，胡芝海一只眼睛负伤，战士王昌洪立即冲上去，抱起炸药继续完成了爆炸任务。这时，敌人打着密集的手榴弹反扑过来，副排长孙兆贵拿过机枪扫垮了敌人的反扑，排长王德恩、二班长秦元堂、战士庞方训等立即冲上了地堡。王排长将一个手榴弹塞进地堡，敌人立即乱窜了，王排长连续打倒两个敌人，二班长秦元堂的冲锋枪横扫过去，又有七八个敌人倒下。这时一班副陈汉机动的带着一个组冲上了红碉堡，机枪、炸弹立即象冰雹一样向反扑的敌群中射掷过去。
    当晚，“李干排”在英雄连长张希春带领下，冲上桥头右侧敌人最后的一个集团碉堡，接连打垮敌人两次激烈的反扑，坚守着已得的阵地。拂晓，勇士们开始强攻，七班长刘正带领全班边打边冲，首先冲过了一片平坦的开阔地，占领了突破口，接着战士何培仁、师庄林、副班长赵天洪一齐冲了过去。
    垂死的敌人还妄图反扑，何培仁的手榴弹准确的打在反扑的敌群中，四勇士用刚缴获的机枪、冲锋枪迎击敌人，手榴弹一个个的在敌群中爆炸，打垮了敌人两次猛力反扑。将一千多敌人压缩在工事里，四勇士象泰山一样坚守在突破口上。这时，我后续部队源源的冲上来了，四勇士立即跟随突进集团堡垒群中，敲人土崩瓦解向河岸逃窜，勇士们在一阵冲杀后又发起了政治攻势，残余敌人遂纷纷放下武器。
    东方旭日初升，解放军跨过运河铁桥，继续向西追击。
