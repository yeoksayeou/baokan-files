　　A Tour of Benxi
    Luo Liyun
    Benxi, renowned for its coal and iron industry, is one of the major heavy industrial cities in Northeast China. There are more than twenty significant factories with modern equipment for steelmaking, iron smelting, refractory materials, coal preparation, coal washing, and coking. However, after two years of Kuomintang rule, almost none of the factories in Benxi are complete. Many factory buildings were dismantled by the Kuomintang army to build bunkers, while machine data were stolen and sold by Kuomintang officials. Steel, refractory materials, and other factories were completely shut down. The city's workforce dwindled from 50,000 to 8,000. It is on this battered foundation that the Benxi People's Government is leading the workers of various factories to begin the restoration of important industries. In the steel sector, which was completely shut down during the Chiang Kai-shek bandit regime, workers are now busy organizing lathes and repairing machines. Their morale is high. When workers at the iron smelting furnace were preparing to repair the furnace and were about to remove an eighty-ton piece of pig iron left over from before liberation, workers from a certain mine automatically sent several people to help. The workers are all vying to contribute to the restoration of the iron smelting furnace. Liu Fengming, recently promoted to casting machinist and head of the processing section, is an old worker with nearly thirty years of experience using steam hammers. He has been very busy these days, going up the mountains every day to find old boilers destroyed by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits to repair. Crane operators at the steel plant are pulling switches on cranes that emit whirring sounds every day. The huge sound of the generator motor shakes the nearby buildings. The red-hot iron blocks in the steelmaking furnace are transformed into molten liquid. The heating furnace emits a red glow—the steel industry has also awakened.
    In the large machine factory, which has eight departments, including machinists, fitters, pattern makers, foundry workers, casters, riveters, crane operators, and file cutters, riveters are drawing lines on iron plates according to the required dimensions and sending them to the shearing machine, busily preparing iron plates for the smokestack of Boiler No. 3. The file factory's grooving machine is constantly making a "da-da" sound, and small electric files are moving up and down rapidly. The average daily output is now 130 files, including triangular, round, and flat files, whereas during the Kuomintang rule, the average daily output was only 100, and all were the less labor-intensive flat files.
    The two beehive-style coking kilns at Miyahara have resumed operation. In just one month, four new kilns have been opened. Another fifteen kilns are currently being renovated by workers in preparation for restoration. The output of Benxi Coal Mine has increased from 280 tons per day at the beginning of the recovery to the current 1,100 tons. Under Kuomintang rule, the highest daily output was only 950 tons.
    After the resumption of work at the refractory material factory in the Benxi area, the number of workers increased from 59 to 145. Most of the buildings of the Baojiawazi Refractory Material Factory were dismantled by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits to build bunkers. The workers are now busy building factory buildings. An old worker with more than twenty years of experience in firing refractory materials has now been promoted to deputy director of the factory. He personally dug open the clay mine entrance, which had been destroyed by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, and crawled more than ten meters in to see if there was still clay inside and whether it could be mined. The workers are full of confidence in the factory's recovery. They believe that all the refractory bricks needed by the coal and iron plants can be supplied by March next year.
    Due to the recovery and expansion of production, more than 300 unemployed workers have returned to the factory. The days when workers had to fill their stomachs with bran and soybean cakes during the Kuomintang occupation are gone forever. The restoration and construction of Benxi's heavy industry still requires a arduous process, but a good start has already been made.

　　本溪巡礼
    罗立韵
    以煤铁工业著称的本溪，是东北有数的重工业城市之一。设备近代化的炼钢、炼铁、耐火材料、选煤、洗煤、炼焦等重要工厂，共有二十多个。但是经过国民党两年的统治，现在的本溪几乎已没有一座工厂还是完整的了。许多工厂的建筑物被国民党军拆毁修了碉堡，机器资料则被国民党官员们盗卖。钢铁、耐火材料等工厂全部停工。全市的工人由五万人减少到八千人。就是在这样一个遍体鳞伤的基础上，本溪人民政府领导着各厂工人开始了各种重要工业的恢复工作。在蒋匪统治时期完全停了工的钢铁部门中，现在工友们正忙着整理旋盘，修理机器。他们情绪很高。当炼铁炉的工友为修理炼铁炉，正着手取出铁炉内解放前遗留下的一块八十吨生铁时，某矿工人自动派去数人帮忙。工友都争着要在修复炼铁炉中立功。该厂最近被提升为铸造机师兼加工课课长的刘凤鸣，是一位使用汽锤将近三十年的老工人。他这些日子忙得很，天天上山找被蒋匪破坏的旧锅炉来修理。炼钢厂的起重工人，每天在发出呜呜声响的吊车上扯动着开关。发电机马达的巨大声音震撼着附近的建筑物。炼钢炉内通红的铁块化为溶体。加热炉透出了红光——炼钢业也苏醒过来了。
    在拥有机工、钳工、模型、翻砂、铸造、铆工、起重、锉刀八个部门的大机器厂里，铆工们正按照所需之尽寸，在铁板上画上线条，送入剪床机，紧张地为三号锅炉准备做烟囱用的铁板。锉刀工厂的切纹机不断的发出哒哒之声，小型电锉上下倏动着。现平均日产三角锉、圆锉、平锉等锉刀一百三十把，而蒋匪统治时日产平均仅一百把，而且全部是比较省工的平锉。
    宫原两个蜂窝式的炼焦窑已复工。在短短一月中，又开出了四个新窑。另有十五个窑现正由工人们整理机器，准备恢复。本溪煤矿的产量已由初收复时的日产二百八十吨增至现在的一千一百吨。在国民党统治时，每日最高产量不过九百五十吨。
    本溪地区的耐火材料工厂复工后，工友由五十九名增至一百四十五名。保家洼子耐火材料工厂大部建筑已被蒋匪拆去筑地堡，现工友们正忙着修建厂房。一位烧耐火材料二十余年的老工友，现已被提升为该厂副厂长。他在被蒋匪破坏了的粘土矿口亲自把土扒开，钻进十几米达，察看里面是否还有粘土，能否开采。工友们对于复厂充满着信心，他们相信煤铁厂所需之耐火砖，到明年三月就可以全部供给。
    由于生产的恢复与扩大，已有三百多失业工人返回工厂。在国民党盘踞时代工人们以糠和豆饼充饥的日子，已经一去不复返了。本溪重工业的恢复与建设，还需要一段艰巨的努力过程，但现在已经是作了良好的开始。（新华社沈阳二十四日电）
