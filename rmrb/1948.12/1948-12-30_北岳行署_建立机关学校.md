Beiyue Administrative Office
	Establishes Cadre School
	[Beiyue Electric] The cadres of the Beiyue Administrative Office have begun theoretical studies and have established a formal cadre school. Theoretical studies are divided into two levels, A and B. Level A is for cadres at the division chief level and above, and the content of study is "The Communist Manifesto." Level B is for cadres with a general level of cultural and theoretical knowledge, and the content of study is "The History of Social Development." The first phase of study will last for one and a half months, focusing on self-study supplemented by group discussions. Cadres and staff with lower levels of cultural and theoretical knowledge are all assigned to the cadre school for cultural studies. The cadre school currently has three types of classes: a junior high school class, a senior primary school class, and a junior primary school class. The cadre school is led by a study committee, and teachers are hired by the study committee from comrades in the office with higher levels of education. Each class has a semester of six months, and a regular testing system is stipulated. The school officially opened and began classes on the 13th.

　　北岳行署
    建立机关学校
    【北岳电】北岳行署机关干部，已开始进行理论学习，并建立了正规的机关干部学校。理论学习分为甲乙两级，甲级为处长一级主要干部，学习内容是“共产党宣言”。乙级为具有一般文化理论水平的干部，学习内容为“社会发展史”。第一期学习时间为一个半月，以自学为主，并辅以集体讨论。文化理论水平较低的干部和事务人员，一律编入机关学校，进行文化学习。机关学校目前共设三种班：一为初中班、一为高小班、一为初小班。机关学校由学委会负责领导，教员由学委会聘请本机关文化水平较高的同志担任。各班均以半年为一学期，并规定定期测验制度。现该校已于十三日开学，正式上课。
