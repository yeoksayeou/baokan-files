    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, December 9th: TASS reports: The Soviet magazine "Foreign Trade" recently published an article on the occasion of the first anniversary of the founding of the Romanian People's Republic, stating that the foreign trade of the Romanian Republic is fundamentally different from that before the war. Now, foreign trade is entirely for the purpose of the most rapid restoration and development of the national economy. Exports of manufactured and semi-finished products and imports of industrial raw materials, machinery, and agricultural equipment have increased. The government's measures to restrict private capital participation in foreign trade are conducive to the development of foreign trade. One of the remarkable achievements of Romania's foreign trade is the export surplus in the first half of 1948, whereas in 1947, imports exceeded exports by two times. Grain occupies the first place in exports, while industrial raw materials and equipment occupy the first place in imports. Soviet imports play a very important role in the revival of Romanian industry. Due to Soviet imports of coking coal and pig iron, Romania's metallurgical industry has rapidly recovered. This year, the economic ties between democratic Romania and its neighboring countries have been greatly strengthened. The magazine concluded by saying that the Soviet Union's friendly act of reducing unpaid reparations by half has enabled Romania to substantially increase investment in the national economy and develop foreign trade. The treaties of friendship, cooperation, and mutual assistance signed by Romania with the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries, as well as various long-term trade treaties and agreements, are a guarantee for Romania's further development.

    使入超显著的转变为出超
    苏联输入品帮助建设极大
    【新华社陕北九日电】塔斯社讯：苏联“对外贸易”杂志顷于罗马尼亚人民共和国建国一周年撰文称：罗马尼亚共和国的对外贸易和战前已根本不同。现在，对外贸易完全是为了最迅速地恢复和发展国民经济。制成品和半制成品的输出，工业原料、机器和农业器械的输入都增加了。政府限制私人资本参加对外贸易的措施，有利于对外贸易的发展。罗马尼亚对外贸易的显著成就之一，是一九四八年上半年的出超，而一九四七年时，输入还超过输出两倍。谷物占输出品的第一位，而输入品中工业原料和装备则占第一位。苏联的输入品，在复兴罗马尼亚工业中起着十分重要的作用。由于苏联输入的焦煤和铣铁，罗国的冶金工业迅速地恢复了。今年，民主罗马尼亚和各邻国间的经济连系已大大加强了。该杂志于结语中称：苏联减少未付的赔款一半的友谊行为，使罗国能相当大量的增加了国民经济中的投资，并使对外贸易得以发展。罗国与苏联及各人民民主国家签订的友好合作与互助条约，以及各项长期的贸易条约和协定，是罗马尼亚进一步发展的保证。
