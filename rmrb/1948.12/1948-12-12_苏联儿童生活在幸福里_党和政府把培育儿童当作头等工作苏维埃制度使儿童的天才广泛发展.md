(Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 10th) Contrary to the tragic situation of children in capitalist countries, affiliated countries, and colonies, the young generation of the Soviet Union freely enjoys all the happiness of childhood. The All-Union Communist Party and the Soviet government regard the work of nurturing children as a top priority, and constantly provide large-scale assistance to women and children. Forty-two days after a baby is born, it can be sent to a nursery; children from four to seven years old can enter kindergarten. After the end of the Second World War, there were more than 15,000 fixed nurseries in the Soviet Union, and more than six million children attended kindergartens and summer camps. The number of nurseries and kindergartens is constantly increasing. According to the post-war five-year plan, by 1950, the number of children admitted to fixed nurseries will increase to 1,251,000, and the number of kindergartens will increase to 2,260,000, which is twice as many as in 1940 before the war. At the same time, "milk stations," "health camps," "children's medical advisory rooms," "children's hospitals," and "children's clinics" are established throughout the country. These measures are of great significance for child rearing, children's health, women's liberation, and the improvement of women's economic, political and social status. The Soviet Union has implemented universal compulsory education for all school-age children (over seven years old), which is seven years in towns and four years in villages. Children's libraries, reading rooms, and laboratories have been established throughout the country. Children have also organized many scientific, technical, literary, drama, and music groups. The Soviet Union now has 160 children's theaters, 500 music and art schools, and 16 dance schools. The Soviet system provides broad possibilities for the development of children's talents.

    苏联儿童生活在幸福里
    党和政府把培育儿童当作头等工作苏维埃制度使儿童的天才广泛发展
    【新华社陕北十日电】与资本主义国家、附属国和殖民地儿童的悲惨境遇相反，苏联年青的一代，已自由地享受着童年的一切幸福。联共党和苏维埃政府，把培育儿童的工作当作头等重要的工作，对妇女儿童经常给予大规模的帮助。婴儿出生以后四十二天，就可以送进托儿所，四岁到七岁的儿童，可以进幼稚园。第二次大战结束后，苏联全国共有固定托儿所一万五千多个，有六百万以上儿童进幼稚园和夏令营。托儿所和幼稚园的数目不断增加，依照战后五年计划，到一九五○年时，固定托儿所受托儿童的名额，将增加到一百二十五万一千，幼稚园的名额将增加到二百二十六万，比战前一九四○年增加两倍。同时，全国各地都设有“给乳站”、“健康营”、“儿童医药顾问室”、“儿童医院”及“儿童门诊所”等。这些措施对于儿童的抚育、儿童的健康、妇女的解放、妇女经济政治和社会地位的提高，都有极大的意义。苏联已经实行了全体学龄儿童（七岁以上的）的普遍强迫教育，城镇中是七年制，乡村中是四年制。全国各地设立着儿童图书馆、阅览室、实验室等。儿童们并组织了许多科学、技术、文学、戏剧和音乐的团体。苏联现有一百六十个儿童剧院、五百所音乐和艺术学校、十六所舞蹈学校。苏维埃制度提供了发展儿童天才的广泛可能性。
