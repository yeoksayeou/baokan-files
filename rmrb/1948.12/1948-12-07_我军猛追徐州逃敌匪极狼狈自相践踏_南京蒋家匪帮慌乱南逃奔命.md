Xinhua News Agency, Huaihai Front, December 5th: The People's Liberation Army is vigorously pursuing the fleeing Kuomintang bandit troops who are desperately trying to escape southwest from Xuzhou. According to reports from accompanying journalists: On the highway from Xiaoxian, southwest of Xuzhou, to Bozhou in northern Anhui, the ground is littered with the enemy's documents, rosters, books, and Kuomintang membership cards. Many baggage cars loaded with various types of ammunition and more than a dozen intact American-made trucks were also seized by our army on the highway because they could not be driven away in time. In many of the backpacks discarded by the enemy, they found sweet potatoes and sorghum buns that they had just looted from the homes of ordinary people. Zhang Chao, a private in the Fourth Company of the Independent Cavalry Regiment of the Fifth Army, had his leg broken by a tank fleeing in panic. He said, "We haven't had a meal in two days. We're just fleeing aimlessly." He said, "Along the way, enemy tanks, cars, and troops were desperately fleeing, trampling each other." He pointed to a corpse by the roadside and said, "He was also crushed to death by a tank." Under the relentless pursuit of our army, the enemy troops surrendered one after another. At the foot of Mao Mountain southwest of Xiaoxian, Comrade Zhang Ming, the battalion commander of the Luoyang Battalion of a certain unit of our army, led a platoon and encountered four companies of enemy troops. The enemy all knelt down on the spot and surrendered their weapons obediently.

Jilu Yu Telegram (Delayed): On the 19th of last month, the local troops of the Jilu Yu Military Region ambushed bandits wandering in the area of Guanzhouji and Xinweizi, west of Xuzhou. A total of 680 bandits were killed, wounded, or captured, one mortar, fifteen machine guns, four hundred long and short guns, nine submachine guns and automatic rifles, 18,000 rounds of ammunition, and eighteen warhorses were seized.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, December 5th: Due to the rapid collapse of the Kuomintang army on the Xuzhou front, the Nanjing petty court is in imminent danger, and the Kuomintang bandit gang is vying to flee. United Press reported from Nanjing on the 3rd that the five yuan of the National Government are hurriedly drawing up evacuation plans. The Kuomintang Air Force Headquarters has been ordered to move to Taiwan within ten days, and the Navy Headquarters is also preparing to move quickly. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and other agencies are packing archives and equipment in preparation for fleeing for their lives. Many officials have been ordered to prepare to go south to Guangzhou or Taiwan. When various agencies under the pseudo-Ministry of National Defense evacuated their families, they robbed cars and seized ships everywhere, causing chaos in the market. At the same time, two hundred officers of the U.S. Military Joint Advisory Group in Nanjing have been ordered to leave Nanjing.
