Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 29th: Having annihilated the Chiang bandits in the Northeast and liberated the entire Northeast, the Northeast People's Liberation Army is now conducting large-scale training in designated locations. Under the slogans "Strive for perfection, further improve tactical skills," "Intensify military training, learn the skills to fight Nanjing!" and "Annihilate all Chiang bandit troops! Liberate all of China!" commanders and fighters are actively summarizing the experiences and lessons learned from the autumn campaign, creating a surge of training. At the beginning of the training, some soldiers did not fully recognize the necessity of serious training. They said, "We have practiced our skills pretty well in the summer, and many skills have not even been used in the autumn offensive. The Chiang bandit troops in the Northeast were wiped out, and even the 'ace' New First Army and New Sixth Army were not up to it. What good are the other Chiang bandit troops?" However, this argument was refuted by other comrades using the principle often spoken by Chairman Mao: do not be arrogant in victory, do not be blinded by victory. During the training, leaders of all units explained the comments of the responsible person of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the current military situation in China, stating that the Chiang Kai-shek government could be fundamentally overthrown in about a year. They called on everyone to work hard, train well, summarize well, and learn well from combat heroes, so that they could better complete their tasks in the future. After realizing this, some comrades said, "That's right! If we all go home and lie on the kang, will the Kuomintang government collapse on its own?" Some comrades said, "We have endured several years of hardship, let's make another effort, and we can win the national victory in about a year." In the training, each unit proposed not only to study military affairs, but also to check and summarize the implementation of urban policies, entry rules, mass discipline, and prisoner policies in the autumn offensive, in order to reward and criticize the good and bad implementation of various policies respectively. In the training, each unit simultaneously launched a mutual learning and mutual assistance movement, uniting and reforming newly liberated soldiers, and helping them improve their class consciousness.

　　东北解放军大规模整训准备为解放全中国而战
    【新华社东北廿九日电】全歼东北蒋匪、解放东北全境后，东北人民解放军，已分别在指定地点进行大规模整训。指战员们在“精益求精，更进一步提高战术技术”、“加紧大练兵，学好本事打南京！”、“全歼蒋匪军！解放全中国！”等口号下，纷纷总结秋季战役中的经验教训，掀起整训热潮。在整训开始时，曾经有些战士对认真整训的必要认识不足。他们这样说：“咱们的本领在夏天就练得差不多啦，秋季攻势中许多本领还没有用上呢，东北蒋匪军便被打光了，‘王牌’的新一军、新六军都不行，别的蒋匪军还顶啥事！”但是这种论调是被其他同志用毛主席所常说的胜利时不要骄傲，不要被胜利冲昏头脑的道理所说服了。在整训中，各部队首长均讲解了中共中央负责人关于目前中国军事形势的评论，说明一年左右就可以根本打倒蒋介石政府，号召大家努力，好好整训，好好总结，好好向战斗英雄学习，以便将来可以更好地完成任务。在认识了以后，有的同志说：“对呀！要是咱们大家都回家往炕上一躺，国民党政府还能自己垮台么？”有的同志说：“好几年艰苦都受过来了，再努一把力，一年左右就能全国胜利了。”各部在整训中，提出不仅要学习军事，还要检查及总结秋季攻势中对城市政策、入城守则、群众纪律、俘虏政策等的执行情形，以便对各种政策执行的好坏分别给予奖励与批评。各部在整训中同时展开互学互助运动，团结与改造新解放战士，帮助其提高阶级觉悟。
