[Hebei-Central China Telegram] Jin County, when beginning to finalize the land reform, because the county party committee did not specifically arrange how villages should start their work, some started with running civil schools; some simply rectified the thinking of party members and gave them crash courses; and some only circled around a few party members, neglecting to work through key members and deeply mobilize the masses. Therefore, the masses' enthusiasm was not high. After checking these deviations, the county party committee convened district-level cadre meetings in different areas, making it clear that: ending land reform must take the issuance of land certificates as the central link, combined with solving other problems left over from the land reform; at the same time, it is necessary to mobilize the masses and conduct it in a guided manner.

After this meeting, county and district cadres generally began to mobilize the masses starting with the issuance of land certificates. Now, out of the county's two hundred and thirteen villages, one hundred and twelve villages have started registering land and houses, or are preparing to register.

During the land registration, each village has shifted from the deviation of simply circling around party members, and they all take party members, cadres, and newly landed households as the backbone to unite and drive the middle peasants, and to conduct propaganda and explanation to those who are not actively registering. Party members and cadres also set an example, driving the masses to register. In Liu Village, Sixth District, in order to register quickly and lead well, they printed a draft according to the style of the land certificate and distributed it to each household, cooperating with their neighbors for registration; and first trained the village cadres and assigned them to various areas to lead and assist. During the registration, it was learned that the masses had many concerns: some were afraid of paying tax deed fees; some were afraid that registering idle places by the fields would mean they would have to pay burdens according to the register in the future; some parents had feudal ideas and were unwilling to write the names of all family members. After discovering these concerns among the masses in Qiji Village, they convened a parents' meeting, explaining that the issuance of land certificates does not require tax deed fees, only labor and material costs, and also explained that land by the fields that cannot be cultivated will not be burdened, which dispelled the masses' concerns.

In terms of leadership, each district is divided into three areas to carry out the work. The district party secretary focuses on leading and plans to inspect and assist other areas. At the same time, they seize good party member cadres and let them go to nearby villages to understand the situation and do publicity and preparation work for issuing land certificates. Because the Eighth District is led by good party branches, half of the villages in the district have already started registering land. They also plan to draw these village cadres to help work in other villages in the future.

In the process of conducting land registration and issuing land certificates, some villages have also paid attention to combining other work. Pangjia Village also solved the problem of disunity among party members. Party members in Zhao Village took the lead in organizing twenty-four study groups, with one hundred and forty people participating, and conducted education on issuing land certificates and getting rich through production. Guanzhuang paid attention to women's work during land registration.

### 晋县县委抓住工作中心环节　从发土地证中发动群众

　　晋县县委抓住工作中心环节
  　从发土地证中发动群众
    【冀中电】晋县在开始着手进行结束土改的时候，因为县委没有具体布置到村应该怎样开始工作，所以有的就从搞民校着手；有的就单纯的整顿党员思想，突训党员；也有的只在少数党员中打圈子，忽视了通过骨干和深入的发动群众来作，因此群众情绪不高。县委在检查出这些偏向以后，又分片召开了区级干部会议，明确指出：结束土改，必须以发土地证为中心环节，结合解决土改中遗留下的其他问题；同时，又必须发动起群众来，有领导的进行。
    经过这次会议以后，一般县干部和区干部都已开始从发土地证着手发动群众。现在全县二百一十三个村庄，有一百一十二个村庄开始登记土地房屋，或正在准备登记。
    在登记土地当中，各村转变了单纯围着党员打圈子的偏向，都以党员干部和新得地户为骨干，去团结和带动中农，向不积极进行登记的人进行宣传解释；党员干部并起模范作用，带动群众来进行登记，六区留村，为了登记的快，好领导，就按照土地证的样式，印了一个草底，发给每户一张，协同四邻进行登记；并先对村干进行了一下训练，分到各片去领导帮助。在登记当中，了解到群众有好多顾虑：如有的怕拿税契钱；怕登记了场边闲地方，将来让按照册子纳负担；有的家长有封建思想，不愿让写上全家的人名。七级村在发现了群众有这些顾虑以后，就召开了家长会议，说明发土地证不拿税契钱，只给工料钱，还说明场边不能耕种的地不纳负担，这才打破了群众的顾虑。
    在领导上，各区都是分成三片来进行，区委书记有重点的领导，有计划的对别的片进行检查和帮助。同时抓住好的党员干部，让他到附近村去了解情况，作发土地证的宣传和准备工作。八区由于通过好的支部领导进行，所以全区有一半村庄已经开始登记土地。还计划将来把这些村干部抽到外村去帮助工作。
    在进行土地登记发土地证工作中，有些村庄还注意结合了别的工作。庞家庄还解决了党员的不团结问题。赵家庄党员带头组织了二十四个学习组，有一百四十人参加，进行了发土地证、生产发家等教育。官庄在登记土地中，并注意了妇女工作。
