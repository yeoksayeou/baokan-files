Xinhua News Agency, Huaihai Front, 15th: When an army unit of the People's Liberation Army was building field fortifications, they adopted a "three checks, three evaluations" method, where cadres check three times and soldiers evaluate three times. This method was used by a certain unit when blocking Huang Wei's Corps in Nanpingji, southwest of Suxian, in late last month. The method is as follows: When the troops arrive at the defensive position, the cadres first look at the terrain, allocate positions, arrange firepower and the location of assault troops, and routes of attack. This is the first check by the cadres. When the soldiers are in place and building, they discuss as they work, seeing whether shooting from the fortifications can prevent the enemy from taking advantage of depressions and concealed terrain. This is the first evaluation by the soldiers. Then the cadres check, and unsuitable aspects are immediately modified. This is the second check by the cadres. Before covering the top of the entrenchments with boards, the soldiers visit each other's positions to have a look, and try out the depth and width before covering. This is the second evaluation by the soldiers. After the fortifications are completed, everyone goes in fully armed to try them out, standing on top and stamping with their feet. This is the third evaluation by the soldiers. Finally, the cadres come to check again to see what fortifications should be added (such as concealed fortifications, camouflage fortifications, depth fortifications, etc.), study how to remove obstacles, measure distances, and select assault routes, etc. This is the third check by the cadres. After completion, a general evaluation and a general exercise are conducted.

　　我军某部阻击黄维兵团时
  　创造修工事新办法
    【新华社淮海前线十五日电】解放军某部在修筑野战工事中，采用了干部三次检查，战士三次评定的三查三评办法。这个办法是上月下旬某部在宿县西南南平集阻击黄维兵团时使用的。该办法是：当部队到达防地时，干部先看地形，分配阵地，布置火力及突击部队位置，出击道路等，这是干部第一查。战士就位修筑时，边做边讨论，看凭工事射击是否能防止敌人利用凹道及隐蔽地形等，这是战士第一评。接着就由干部检查，不适合者立即修改，这是干部第二查。在盖门板前，战士们互相参观，试一试深浅宽窄，然后再盖，这是战士第二评。在工事做完后，各人全部武装进去试一试，站在顶上用脚踏一踏，这是战士第三评。最后干部再来检查看还应该增加什么工事（如隐蔽工事、伪装工事、纵深工事等），研究如何排除障碍，测量距离，选择突击道路等等，这是干部第三查。做完后，又进行一次总评定，总演习。
