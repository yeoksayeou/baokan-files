　　Yangquan Establishes Vocational School to Cultivate Talent for Industrial and Mining Construction
    [Our Dispatch] Since liberation until May of this year, Yangquan City has incorporated the coal and iron producing areas of Pingding County surrounding Yangquan City under its jurisdiction, in order to greatly develop industry, mining and commerce. Currently, the entire city has 17,171 households, with a population of 70,142 men and women. Over 80 percent of the population relies on coal and iron mining for their livelihood. After liberation, with the active support of our democratic government, industry and mining have gradually recovered and developed. Consequently, there is a severe lack of industrial and mining technical cadres and economic cadres. In August, the Municipal Party Committee convened a symposium of responsible cadres from various departments of the city to study the cultivation of industrial and mining talent, solve Yangquan's current and future cadre problems, and decided to establish a vocational school dedicated to training cadres in mining, metallurgy, economic construction, and cultural undertakings, to serve the people's various mines and factories and national education in Yangquan. The vocational school officially started classes on October 10th. There are two vocational classes, enrolling 79 students, and training classes (with one class each for industry and mining, accounting, and teacher training) totaling 128 students. After the start of the semester, the industry and mining class, due to the temporary lack of full-time teachers, invited cadres from the industry and mining departments and government to teach part-time. Initially, cadres were busy with their own departmental work and unable to attend classes on time. The lack of reference books for compiling teaching materials, the lack of mineral specimens for practical training, and the lack of experimental equipment for physics and chemistry had a great impact on the original teaching plan. The issue of some self-funded students in the vocational class also presented difficulties. According to Wang Dailing, the vice-principal of the school: Since the establishment of the vocational school, it has encountered many difficulties, and is now actively seeking solutions.

　　阳泉成立职业学校培养工矿建设人材
    【本报讯】阳泉市自解放后到今年五月间，已将阳泉市周围平定县属之产煤铁区，划归阳泉市管辖，以便大量发展工矿商业，现全市共有一万七千一百七十一户，男女七万零一百四十二人。百分之八十以上的人口，都靠煤铁矿生活。解放后，在我民主政府积极扶助下，工矿业已逐渐恢复与发展；因之工矿技术干部及经济干部极感缺乏，八月间市委会召开该市各部门负责干部座谈会，研究培养工矿人材，解决阳泉当前与将来的干部问题，并决定创办职业学校一所，专门训练采矿、冶金、经济建设、文化事业等干部，为人民的阳泉市各矿厂及国民教育服务。职业学校已于十月十日开课。计职业班两班，录取七十九名，训练班（设工矿、会计、师资各一班）共一百二十八名，开学后在教学上工矿班因一时尚无专任教员，聘请工矿部门及政府干部兼课，开始时曾因干部忙于本部门工作，不能按时上课。编印教材缺乏参考书籍实习缺乏矿物标本，理化缺乏实验仪器，对原定教学计划，很有影响。职业班部分自费生问题也有困难，据该校副校长王岱岭谈：职校创立以来，遇到许多困难，现正积极设法解决。
