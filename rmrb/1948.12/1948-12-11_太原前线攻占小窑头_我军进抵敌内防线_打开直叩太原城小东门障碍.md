    【Taiyuan Front Dispatch】The People's Liberation Army besieging Taiyuan has captured Xiaoyaotou, an important position on the enemy's inner defense line, clearing obstacles for a direct assault on Taiyuan City's East Gate. The Xiaoyaotou position is connected to Niutuozhai in the northwest and Naoma in the southwest, located seven li from Taiyuan City. It is the last high mountain slope before reaching the city. From there, passing through Chenjiayu, one can directly assault the East Gate of Taiyuan City. Frontline reporter Ren Jianqing reported on the battle for Xiaoyaotou, stating: On the afternoon of the 26th, our attacking forces annihilated the remnants of the Yan-Japanese coalition's Tenth Column defending the position (this unit was previously annihilated during the Jinzhong Campaign), capturing the No. 1 and No. 2 pillboxes and field fortifications. On the afternoon of the 27th, the enemy in the No. 3 to No. 5 pillboxes were frightened away by our fierce offensive. The No. 6 pillbox was also quickly captured by us. During the attack on the No. 14 pillbox and the No. 2 field fortification, Yang Xiaoguang, a squad leader from a certain unit, single-handedly conducted more than ten consecutive demolitions, destroying the enemy's outer moat and perimeter. The warriors of one squad, like fierce tigers, rushed into the moat and climbed up using ladders amidst the smoke and dust from the explosions. The enemy frantically threw hand grenades, but our assault team retaliated with volleys of grenades, advancing along the communication trenches to the rear of the pillbox. Most of the defenders surrendered. When the remaining enemies retreated towards the No. 13 pillbox, the Eighth Squad cut off their retreat from the flank. They breached the outer moat three times and climbed upwards using small ladders. The first man, Pang Chengwen, fell down. The second man, Yang Wenzhi, followed, but an enemy grenade exploded, injuring his hands, face, and mouth. Nevertheless, he picked up the grenade and threw it into the pillbox. The third man, Ren Zhenhe, was also wounded, but they finally eliminated all the defenders. The No. 15 pillbox and others south of the highway were also captured by us. On the morning of the 28th, the Yan bandits launched a counterattack on the No. 13 and No. 14 positions with four regiments. At 11:00 AM, the enemy began using artillery fire to cover the advance of small groups of troops, luring our army to expend large amounts of ammunition. Then, under the coercion of the Yan bandit's supervisors, they swarmed forward in droves, falling one after another into the fire net composed of our machine guns, small cannons, and hand grenades. More and more enemies came, and the artillery fire became more intense. In the No. 14 pillbox position, within a radius of less than 50 meters, more than a hundred shells fell in an instant, and dust filled the air. The machine guns were clogged with dirt and ash, but our warriors' hand grenades continued to blossom among the enemy ranks. The enemy's five trucks could not keep up with transporting the wounded, and the corpses filled the trenches. In order to completely annihilate the enemy, we actively withdrew from the No. 14 pillbox. When the enemy swarmed in, before they could gain a firm foothold, we reoccupied the No. 14 pillbox.

    On the morning of the 30th, a regiment of the Yan bandit's Fortieth Division launched five counterattacks, all of which failed. Hou Tongfang, the political instructor of a certain company, fought alongside the soldiers and was wounded but refused to leave the front line. The unit only withdrew voluntarily when the Yan bandits shamelessly released poison gas. At night, the enemy in the No. 14 position left a small force to resist head-on, while the main force hid on the left and right flanks, waiting for our army to charge up and then launch a pincer attack. Tian Zhongjia, a platoon leader from a certain company, discovered this enemy plot and also used a small force to seize the main pillbox head-on, while the main force split up and advanced on the left and right. The Seventh Company also followed up, and more than a hundred enemies immediately knelt down and surrendered. At the No. 15 pillbox, the Second Squad and the Eighth Squad launched attacks from both flanks. The enemies panicked and threw hand grenades wildly, but we took advantage of the smoke to cut the barbed wire and quickly captured it. On the evening of the 31st, the Yan bandits attempted to use 30 mountain guns to block our advance, but the Ren Wantong team advanced through the smoke to clear mines. Cai Wenbin carried three boxes of explosives and conducted a single-person demolition. Half of the Zhang Shuiqun team attacked from the breach, while the other half climbed the parapet using ladders. Zhang Ergou jumped up and threw a flying thunderbolt into the enemy pillbox, then searched and entered the pillbox from the communication trench. A hand grenade was thrown in, and the enemies surrendered. Duan Baogang, the squad leader of the Ninth Squad, led a team to assault the main pillbox, shouting, "Surrender and live!" The enemies surrendered. The enemies who had retreated earlier tried to counterattack, but two hand grenades suppressed them. From then on, the Xiaoyaotou position was firmly occupied by us, clearing the obstacles for a direct assault on the East Gate of Taiyuan City.

    太原前线攻占小窑头
    我军进抵敌内防线
    打开直叩太原城小东门障碍
    【太原前线电】围攻太原的人民解放军已攻占阎匪内防线的重要阵地小窑头，打开直叩太原城小东门的障碍。小窑头阵地西北连接牛驼寨，西南连接淖马，距太原城直径七里，为进抵该城最后一个高山坡，自此而下，经过陈家峪，即可直叩太原城之小东门。前线记者任剑青报导小窑头争夺战称：廿六日下午五时我军攻击部队歼灭守敌阎日合流的十纵队残部（该部在晋中战役中曾被歼），占领该阵地一号二号碉及野战阵地。廿七日下午，三号至五号碉的敌人，为我之猛烈攻势吓跑。六号碉亦迅速为我占领。攻十四号碉和二号野战阵地时，某部二班杨小光单人连续进行十多次的爆破，炸垮敌人的外壕外沿。一班勇士象猛虎一样冲至壕内，乘爆破的灰烟架梯爬上去，敌人乱投掷手榴弹，我突击小组即以排子手榴弹还击，顺交通壕发展至碉后，守敌大部缴枪。残敌向十三号碉退窜时，八班从侧翼截断敌人的归路，他们三次爆破外壕，搭小梯子向上爬，第一名庞成文摔下来，第二名杨文志接着上，敌人塞出来颗手榴弹，他的手、脸、嘴都被炸伤，仍拿起手榴弹向碉堡里投。第三名任镇河也负了伤，终将全部守敌解决。汽车路南的十五号碉等也被我占领。二十八日上午，阎匪以四个团的兵力向十三号十四号阵地反扑，十一时敌开始以炮火掩护小股兵力前进，诱我军大量投弹，接着就在阎匪督战队逼迫之下，成群结队蜂拥而来，接二连三倒毙于我机枪小炮手榴弹所组成的火网之中。敌人越来越多，炮火更猛，我十四号碉阵地方圆不到五十公尺，顷刻间竟落炮弹百余发，尘土弥漫，机枪满塞土灰，我勇士们的手榴弹仍在敌群中开花，敌人五辆汽车运伤兵都来不及，死尸把战壕都填满了。我为全歼该敌，主动撤离十四号碉。等到敌人蜂拥而来，立足未稳之时，我又攻占十四号碉。
    三十日上午阎匪四十师一个团的兵力五次反扑均未得逞。某连政指侯同防和战士们并肩作战，此次负伤不下火线。至阎匪无耻放毒气时，该部才自动撤离。入夜，十四号阵地之敌留少数部队正面抵抗，主力隐蔽左右，待我军冲上去再来夹击我军。某连田中家排长发现敌此阴谋，也以小数部队正面夺取主碉，主力分开左右发展，七连也接着攻上去，一百多敌人即跪在地下缴枪。十五号碉那里，二班八班从两翼突击，敌人惊慌的乱投手榴弹，我乘其烟雾炸断铁丝网，迅速将其占领。三十一日黄昏，阎匪企图以卅门山炮阻我前进，任万同小组在烟雾中扫雷前进，蔡文斌背三箱炸药，作单人爆破，张水群组一半从爆破口突击，一半登梯子上棱坎。张二狗纵身一跃，猛投飞雷到敌碉去，再从交通壕搜索进碉，一颗手榴弹打进去，敌人就缴了枪。九班段宝岗带个小组突击主碉，大喊一声“缴枪不杀！”敌人便投降了，先前退走的敌人还想反扑，两颗手榴弹便把他们压下去了。从此小窑头的阵地为我牢固地占领。打开直叩太原城小东门的障碍。
