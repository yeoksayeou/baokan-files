Xinhua News Agency, East China, 14th. The restoration of over 1,500 li of major highways has cleared land transportation in the Central and Southern Shandong region. This massive undertaking was completed on November 20th, two days before the annihilation of Huang Botao's corps. The road repair project took just one month. In addition to the major highways, there were 99 auxiliary roads and diversions, and 380 bridges. Now, the roads extend in all directions, from the coast of the Yellow Sea in the east to the edge of the Grand Canal in the west, from the Jiaoji Railway in the north to the Longhai Railway in the south. During the road repair, thousands upon thousands of cadres and civilian laborers, in order to complete the project as soon as possible and powerfully support the Huaihai Campaign, worked tirelessly day and night, braving difficulties. For example, during the construction of a certain large bridge, over 300 young men and women, led by the secretary of the local Communist Party District Committee and the heads of the People's Government at the district and township levels, bravely went into the river and persisted in driving piles, blocking dams, and tying ropes in the waist-deep ice water for three or four hours. This enthusiasm and heroic action of the cadres and civilian laborers played a significant role in the rapid completion of the road construction task.

　　修复交通好支前
  　鲁中南修好公路千五百里
    【新华社华东十四日电】一千五百余里主要公路的修复，已使山东鲁中南区的陆路交通畅通。这个巨大的工作，是在上月二十日，即歼灭黄伯韬兵团的前二日完成的。修路工程先后费时不过一个月。主要公路之外，并有附路转道九十九处，桥梁三百八十座。现在东起黄海海岸，西迄运河边，北至胶济铁路，南至陇海铁路，已公路四达。在修路中，成千成万的干部及民工，为了争取早日完工，有力的支援淮海战役，曾不避艰险，日夜不停地赶修着。如在修筑某座大桥时，即有三百余青壮年在当地中共区委书记及人民政府的区、乡长带头影响下，奋勇下河，在深及腰部的冰水里，坚持打桩、堵坝、拴绳子达三、四小时之久。干部及民工们的这种热情与英勇行动曾对迅速完成公路修筑的任务起了巨大作用。
