To the responsible comrades of the Beiyue First-Fourth-Fifth Branch and the various branches in Central Hebei:
　　Your timely organization and reporting of the army recruitment movement this time is very good, but there are not many reports on the production situation in various places this winter, especially in terms of sideline occupations. Therefore, we hope that you will pay more attention to reporting on the activities of the masses in various places in carrying out various sideline productions, as well as the construction of water conservancy projects, the manufacturing of agricultural tools, the increase of livestock, and the accumulation of fertilizer and other production preparation work.

To the Propaganda Department Office of the Jinnan First-Second-Third-Fifth District Committee:
　　We have received the various work summaries and reports you sent. These materials are very good and have been of great help to this newspaper. We hope that you will continue to send them.

　　The first group of villages that have completed the land reform and party rectification have now turned to winter production, and some areas have started the second group of villages. What new problems and new experiences have these villages encountered in ending land reform, rectifying the party, and turning to winter production? We hope that you can quickly organize reports.

专栏：通讯往来

　　通讯往来北岳一四五支社及冀中各支社负责同志：
    你们这次及时的组织报导了参军运动，这是很好的，但对今冬各地生产情形报导的不多，特别是副业方面的，因此希望多注意报导各地群众进行各种副业生产，及兴修水利，制造农具，增加牲畜，积肥等生产准备工作的情形。冀南一二三五地委宣传部办公室：
    你们寄来的各种工作总结及情况，均收到了，这些材料很好，给本报很大的帮助，希望继续惠寄。
    各地第一批完成了结束土改与整党的村庄，现已转入冬季生产，有的地区第二批村庄又开始了，这些村在结束土改整党及转入冬季生产中，有什么新问题及新的经验，望能迅速地组织报导。
