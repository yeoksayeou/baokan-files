　　On the Psychological Changes of Chiang's "Generals"
    Liu Baiyu
    When the guns were still roaring on the Jinzhou battlefield, I saw numerous groups of prisoners being escorted down. The Battle of Jinzhou alone captured as many as thirty-six general-level officers. The new characteristic of the prisoner groups was that these people quickly settled into their situation; this phenomenon immediately evoked a memory and a comparison in me. In the winter of 1946, when our army, in the extreme cold of minus forty degrees, crossed the Songhua River and wiped out, one regiment after another, the New First Army, which falsely claimed to be the "best army under heaven," we also captured many mid-level officers. At that time, they were stubbornly arrogant and believed that they were captured because our army did not follow the "rules" and fight them in positional warfare. This was only a year ago. Now the situation is very different. The Chiang's "generals" in Jinzhou have provided many interesting materials in this regard. It is said that after our army captured Han Wang Dian Mountain, the main position on the southern line of Jinzhou, on November 9th, Fan Hanjie, Lu Junquan, and Shen Xiangkui, commander of the New Eighth Army, sat together drinking tea. Lu said, "Wherever a telegram addressed as 'Dear Brother' from the Chairman arrives, that place is finished. I think Jinzhou will receive a 'Dear Brother' telegram soon." At the time, they just smiled bitterly at each other. This prediction came true a few days later. The Jinzhou defenders, from the highest commander Fan Hanjie to the entire staff, without exception, were captured from their positions according to the "rules" of the People's Liberation Army. Jing Yang, the captured commander of the Provisional 18th Division, said it well: "Everyone is here, except for the guns and horses."

    For a long time, Chiang Kai-shek's days have been getting worse and worse. The People's Liberation Army has won successive victories inside and outside the passes, and thunderous blows have landed on the head of the Chiang bandit. In the flames of the People's Liberation War, at the time when Chiang Kai-shek was suffering the consequences he deserved, he exhausted all means to try to save his tottering little dynasty. In the second year of the People's Liberation War, he carried out a series of replacements of "generals," and even his adopted son Chen Cheng fell from power. But the situation did not improve at all. In the third year of the People's Liberation War, Chiang Kai-shek was even more busy personally supervising the battle; but wherever this ominous bird flew, that place fell. Supervising the battle could only turn into mourning. Under these circumstances, the psychological changes of his "generals" became even more drastic. During the Jinzhou campaign, our army seized a letter in the headquarters of An Shouren, commander of the enemy's Provisional 55th Division. It was sent to An from the Kuomintang Army University in Chongqing on September 15th, saying: "No matter what, I think the 'bandits' have ambitious goals in this invasion, including the entire Northeast. Their forces have been reorganized and trained for three months, and this time they will certainly not be kind. I think our troops in the Northeast, when storms and snow arrive, will face the final severe test. My brother should have a broad view in this chaotic world. As the ancients said, the sage does not dwell on things, but can move with the times. My brother should pay attention to this meaning, and in times of crisis, should be good at adapting and not be too rigid." The entire meaning of this passage is very clear: it is to call for surrender or escape, and not to give their lives for Chiang Kai-shek. It also echoes another secret document seized in Jinzhou, namely the so-called "cadres in conversations, often mention going to Jiamusi for training, to change the taste." These all show that this kind of emotional change in the Kuomintang army not only permeates the front lines, but also deeply permeates Chongqing, the rear of the Chiang bandits, and the Army University where the Chiang bandits train senior commanders. Of course, this kind of psychological change is not surprising at all. In history, every tyrannical dynasty, when facing its final collapse, will have this kind of psychological change. An Shouren, commander of the Provisional 55th Division on the Jinzhou battlefield, also truly "adapted" and raised his hands to surrender at the final moment.

    Chiang Kai-shek likes to cry and stomp his feet the most. During the summer campaign last year, the reporter obtained his secret document No. 224. He was shouting that this was "a great humiliation for the revolutionary army," "know shame and strive for self-improvement," "honor and life," etc., and wailing to senior officers what "If I defeat the war criminals, you will all become White Russians." But all this could not improve the psychology of the "generals." Why? Because his senior "generals" also saw this chess move clearly; Chiang Kai-shek is bound to lose, and Chiang Kai-shek is bound to die. Just as Chen Chengqiao, the captured deputy commander of the 79th Division in Jinzhou, said: "The overall situation in China has been completely decided, and major cities across the country will be like Jinzhou one by one." This is the inevitable result of the great victory of the People's Liberation War in the past two years. Time is forever terrible for Chiang Kai-shek. Zheng Dongguo, who was still singing "firm will" and "weather the storm together" a few days ago, did he not lead his troops to collectively surrender to the people? But this kind of psychological change is indeed very necessary for Chiang's "generals," because the time to surrender to the people has arrived, and the victory of the People's Liberation War is coming. Every Chiang's "general" should pay attention to considering his position, forward or backward, in the final list of war criminals, or to obtain the people's forgiveness and leniency.

　　评蒋家“将军”们心理变化
    刘白羽
    记者在锦州战场上枪炮声未停的时候，就看到极多的俘虏群被押送下来。锦州之战俘获将级军官就有三十六人之多。俘虏群的新特色是这些人很快就安之若素了；这现象立刻引起我的一种回忆和一种对比。一九四六年冬，当我军在零下四十度的奇寒中，一下松花江曾把妄称“天下第一军”的新一军一个团一个团干干净净消灭时，也捉到了许多中级军官，当时他们那种顽固的傲气十足，他们认为所以被俘是由于我军没有按着“规矩”跟他们打阵地战的缘故。这仅仅是一年以前的事。现在的情况大大不同了，锦州的蒋家“将军”们在这方面提供了不少有趣的材料。据说当上月九日我军拿下锦州南线主要阵地罕王殿山后，范汉杰、卢浚泉和新八军军长沈向奎坐在一起喝茶，卢说：“那里有委员长称呼‘老弟’的电报一到，那里就算完了，我看锦州接到‘老弟’的电报快了。”当时他们只是相对苦笑。这一预言在几日之后果然灵验了。锦州守敌从最高指挥官范汉杰起全班人马无一漏网，都按着解放军的“规矩”从阵地上被捉下来。被俘后的暂十八师师长景阳说的好：“人都到齐了，就是没有枪马了。”
    很久以来蒋介石的日子一天比一天不好过了，关里关外人民解放军连续胜利，巨雷一声跟一声落在蒋匪头上。蒋介石在人民解放战争烈火中，受他应得后果的时日里，曾用尽一切方法想挽救他那摇摇欲坠的小王朝。在人民解放战争第二个年头，他来了一番“将军”们的轮回替换，连其干儿子陈诚也坠败下台。可是局面却不因此稍好一点点。在人民解放战争第三个年头，蒋介石更奔忙于亲自督战；可是这个不祥之鸟飞到哪里，哪里就陷落，督战只能变为吊孝，在这种情况下，他的“将军”们的心理变化就变得更剧烈起来。锦州战役中，我军在敌暂五十五师师长安守仁的司令部里缴获了一封信，这还是九月十五日由重庆国民党陆军大学航寄给安的，信里说：“不论如何，我认为‘匪’此次进犯企图远大，包括整个东北，其兵力经三个月之整补训练，此番之来定然不善。想我在东北之部队，当暴风霜雪到来之际，定面临最后严重考验也。我弟当兹乱世，应有达观看法。古人所谓圣人不凝滞于物，而能与世推移。弟应重视此意，遇有困难千钧一发之际，应善达变，不可过于呆板。”这段话的全部意义很明白，就是叫投降或逃跑，不要给蒋介石卖命；也和锦州缴获的另一秘密文件遥相呼应，即所谓“干部于谈话中，时有到佳木斯受训，换换口味之论调。”这些都说明了国民党军这种情绪变化不但弥漫在火线上，而且深深弥漫到了蒋匪后方的重庆，弥漫到蒋匪训练高级指挥官的陆军大学里。当然这种心理变化一点也不足奇怪，历史上每一个暴政王朝，当其面临最后崩溃时，都会有这种心理变化的。在锦州战场上的暂五十五师师长安守仁也真正“达变”，而在最后关头举手被俘了。
    蒋介石最喜欢痛哭流涕顿足跺脚。去年夏季作战时，记者获得其二二四号的秘密文件，他正在嘶喊这是“革命军大耻辱”，“知耻自强”，“荣誉和生命”等等，并对高级军官哀号什么“我打败了作战犯，你们都会作白俄”。可是这一切不能改善“将军”们的心理，为什么？因为他的高级“将军”们也看清这一步棋；蒋介石必败，蒋介石必死。正如锦州被俘的七十九师副师长陈成樵说的一样：“中国大局已完全决定了，全国各大城市将一个个和锦州一样。”这是两年以来人民解放战争伟大胜利的必然结果。时间对于蒋介石是永远可怕的，几天前还高唱“坚定意志”，“风雨同舟”的郑洞国，不就是率部向人民集体缴械投降了吗？但是这种心理变化对蒋家“将军”们确是十分需要的，因为向人民投降的时机到了，人民解放战争的胜利即将到来，每一个蒋家“将军”，都应该注意考虑他自己在战争罪犯的名单里最后所占有的前后地位，或者是获得人民的饶恕和宽大了。
