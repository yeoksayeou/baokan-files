To journalist comrades conducting city interviews:

　　Thanks to your and the branch offices' and the broad masses of correspondents' active efforts, urban reporting has now preliminarily opened up. In order to realize the general and branch offices' December plan to strengthen industrial and commercial reporting, we hope that you will continue to conduct in-depth interviews, learn humbly, grasp the main problems in local work, and quickly organize reports.

To Comrades Du Zhanchao, Zeng Wenjing, and the Shijiazhuang Branch Office:

　　We hope that in December you will have focused and systematic introductions to several important industries in Shijiazhuang, such as the Da Xing Yarn Factory and the Railway Factory. Also, provide vivid and concrete reports on the lives of the workers.

To Comrades Bu Ke and Guangming:

　　We agree with your reporting plan for Yangquan City. We hope that the report on certain state-owned stores in the city causing a blind rise in iron prices in pursuit of profit will be sent quickly. We also hope that the report on iron furnace cooperation will be completed in December.

To Comrades Tian Liu and Lin Li:

　　The report on the situation in Handan has been received. We agree with your work plan and hope that you will proceed with it step by step. We also hope that you will provide a comprehensive introduction to the cities of Handan and Xingtai in December, such as the status of industrial and commercial recovery and development, and that you will seize on problems and experiences for reporting.

To county committees, district committees, and correspondent comrades in various counties:

　　During the autumn and winter seasons, various localities have conducted intensive training for a large number of rural Party member cadres, which has played a positive role in promoting work such as Party consolidation, the conclusion of land reform, and winter production. However, there have been few reports reflecting the extent to which the trained Party member cadres have played an active role in recent practical work, and the differences in their thinking, working methods, and style compared to the past. Please pay attention to reporting the positive role played by Party members and cadres in their work, and the specific process of their ideological and work transformations.

To the Taihang Fifth District Committee, Lin County Committee, and Ye County Committee:

　　In the work of concluding land reform, you have promoted and cultivated a large number of district-level cadres. In Ye and Lin counties alone, more than 800 cadres were promoted and cultivated in two months. Currently, many counties have written to inquire about your specific experience in promoting and cultivating cadres. Please summarize and report.

To the Ping Shun County Committee Office:

　　In the draft you wrote on the completion of land reform, it states that "the placement of landlords and rich peasants at a level below one-half of the average accounts for 84.4%." How many villages does this statistic cover? What is the living condition of these households placed "below one-half of the average"? Is this level sufficient to maintain life and enable them to engage in production? We hope you can provide a detailed introduction to the living and production conditions of one or two households in order to understand the situation and conduct research.

    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　十二月十三日各县县委会、区委会、通讯员同志：
    秋冬两季，各地集训了大量农村党员干部，对整党结束土改冬季生产等工作起了不少积极推动作用。但受过训的党员干部在最近一段实际工作中起到积极作用的程度，思想上、工作方法上、作风上和过去有那些不同，各地很少来稿反映，请大家注意报导党员、干部在工作中所起的积极作用，及其思想、工作转变的具体过程。太行五地委会、林县、邺县县委会：
    结束土改工作中，你们提拔培养了大批区级干部，仅邺、林两县两月就提拔培养了八百多个干部，现不少县份来信询问你们提拔培养干部的具体经验，请你们总结报导。平顺县委办公室：
    你们写来的完成结束土改稿内有“安置地富在水平二分之一以下的占百分之八十四点四。”这是几个村的统计？安置到“水平二分之一以下”的这些户，其生活状况如何？这种水平是否足以维持生活并使其能进行生产？希能详细介绍一两户的生活及生产状况，以便了解情况进行研究。                                通联科
