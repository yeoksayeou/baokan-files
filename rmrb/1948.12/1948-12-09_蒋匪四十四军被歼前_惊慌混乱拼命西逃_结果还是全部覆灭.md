Xinhua News Agency, Huaihai Front, 1st. Frontline reporters report on the wretched condition of the Nationalist army before its annihilation in the Nianzhuang area: Chiang Kai-shek's 44th Army of the 9th Pacification Zone, under Li Yan, in an attempt to escape annihilation, abandoned Haizhou on November 7th and fled west to Xin'anzhen to join Huang Botao's corps. As a result, while fleeing west from Xin'anzhen to Xuzhou, it was trapped along with Huang's corps and faced complete annihilation. This serves as a good lesson for the Chiang army, which still hopes to survive by fleeing under the current military situation. Yang Nancun, the commander of the 450th Regiment of the army, described the annihilation of his unit after his surrender:

　　"When we heard that the People's Liberation Army was coming, we quickly withdrew from Haizhou on November 6th and arrived in Xin'anzhen on the 7th. In the afternoon, Deputy Division Commander Lin Wenbo told us, 'It's bad! The Eighth Route Army has sent ten columns. Huang's corps has fled, and we must leave quickly! Leave behind anything you can't carry! The Eighth Route Army is already catching up from behind!' He also said that we had to cross the Grand Canal by 12 o'clock on the night of the 7th to escape danger. This scared everyone, and there was no talk of 'fighting' at all.

　　On the 8th, we arrived at the artillery depot and the east station of the Grand Canal, and several units were squeezed together in a chaotic mess. The 100th Army was hit by your forces, and those who fell into the river while crossing trampled on each other, resulting in several thousand casualties and people scattering. My regiment also lost five or six hundred men, and all our baggage was lost. The 100th Army fought with us over the escape route, even to the point of our own people confiscating each other's guns. They destroyed the bridge before the last two regiments could cross. My regiment originally had more than 2,600 men, but after crossing the river, only about 1,300 were left.

　　It is said that Chiang Kai-shek ordered us to defend Nianzhuang for ten days, and they would send Qiu's corps to reinforce us. But the so-called reinforcements never appeared. From the 10th onward, we relied entirely on airdrops for ammunition and food, and each person received only a few biscuits a day. At 8:00 p.m. on the 12th, your forces began to attack, and within two hours, the southeast corner was breached. Many of us were killed by our own artillery fire. The 3rd Battalion commander was killed, and the 1st Battalion commander and the deputy regimental commander were seriously injured and crawled back, saying, 'The situation is hopeless, what's the point of fighting?' At around 10:00 p.m., we issued an order to cease resistance and sent Deputy Regiment Commander Wei and the 2nd Battalion commander to surrender to your forces. A squad leader from your forces came over and told us to raise our hands and surrender our weapons, so we raised our hands and surrendered."

　　蒋匪四十四军被歼前
  　惊慌混乱拼命西逃  结果还是全部覆灭
    【新华社淮海前线一日电】南线记者报导国民党军在碾庄地区被歼前的狼狈状况称：蒋匪第九绥军李延军部四十四军，为了逃脱被歼命运，曾于十一月七日弃守海州，西逃新安镇投靠黄伯韬兵团，结果在由新安镇西逃徐州途中，和黄兵团一起陷入了完全被歼的绝境。这对于在目前军事形势下还想借逃跑来苟延残喘的蒋军是一个很好的教训。该军四五零团团长杨南村在投降后口述该部被歼的情形说：
    “我们听说解放军来了，便赶快于十一月六日撤出海州，七日赶到新安镇，下午副师长林文波对我们说：“不好了！八路来了十个纵队。黄兵团都跑了，咱们还不快走！东西带不了，就丢了吧！后面八路已经追上来了！并且说，七日晚上十二点钟就得过运河，才能脱离危险。这一说吓得人心惶惶，根本说不上“打仗”了。
    八日赶到炮军和运河东站，几个部队挤成一团，插的乱七八糟。一百军被贵军打了一下，过河时掉到河里的又互相践踏？这样死伤的，走散的就有几千人。我这个团也损失五六百人，行李驮子全部丢光。一百军因为争路逃命，和我们打起来，弄到自己人缴自己人的枪，后面两个团没有过完，他们就把桥砸了。我团本来有二千六百多人，拉过河后，只剩下一千三百多人。
    据说蒋介石下命令要我们在碾庄驻守十天，他们要派邱兵团增援。可是所谓援兵连影子也没有见。从十日起，弹药粮食全靠空投，每人一天只分到几块饼干。十二日晚八点钟，贵军开始攻击，才两小时，东南角就突破了，我们被自己炮火打死的很多，三营营长打死了，一营长和副团长都负重伤爬回来说：“大势已去，还打什么。”到了十时左右，我们就发出停止抵抗的号令，派韦团副和二营长出来向贵军请降，贵军一个班长过来叫我们都举手缴枪，我们就举手缴了枪。”
