　　Baoding Railway Workers Resist Chiang Kai-shek Bandits' Sabotage
 　　Bravely Protect Machinery
	Locomotives and Engine Rooms Intact, Preparing to Resume Work
	[Our Newspaper] During the Chiang Kai-shek bandits' frenzied sabotage, the Baoding railway workers bravely protected the machinery, fully demonstrating the heroic and tenacious character of the working class. When the enemy and us were fighting in the suburbs, more than twenty locomotive workers braved enemy aircraft bombing and artillery shelling to push four locomotives into the engine room and hide them, sealing the driver's plant as well. Liu Fenglin, a boiler washing worker, fearing that the machinery would rust, also wiped the cylinders and other important parts with oil. On the 21st, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits systematically destroyed railway facilities. The large water tower with a capacity of sixty tons and the iron bridge southwest of the city were destroyed. Qi Fu, a 53-year-old driver foreman, hurriedly locked the door of the locomotive section and said to the workers: "The machinery is our lifeblood, and we must never let them destroy it. Let's protect it well and hand it over to the People's Liberation Army. The railway will soon be open to Shijiazhuang." The workers were resolute and tenacious, never leaving the machinery, until the People's Liberation Army entered the city, and the locomotives, carriages, and important parts of the engine room were intact. A few unscrupulous elements attempted to take advantage of the chaos to loot, but were all dissuaded by the workers. After the People's Liberation Army entered the city, it quickly established the Baoding Railway Control Committee and actively prepared to resume work. On the same day, 170 workers registered to sign up. Workers who had hidden in the countryside to avoid being conscripted by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits also returned home one after another to report to the Control Committee. The workers spontaneously formed a picket team to maintain order in the station area.

　　保定铁路工人反抗蒋匪破坏
  　奋不顾身保护机器
    机车机房完好无损正筹备复工
    【本报讯】保定铁路工人在蒋匪疯狂破坏之际，奋不顾身保护机器，充分表现了工人阶级英勇顽强的本色。当敌我在城郊作战时，二十多个机务工人冒着敌机轰炸和敌炮轰击，将四台机车推进车房隐藏，连司机厂一起封好。洗炉工人刘凤林怕机器生锈，还将汽缸等重要机件用油擦干。二十一日，蒋匪有计划的破坏铁路设施，容量六十吨的大水塔和城西南的铁桥均被炸毁，五十三岁的司机领班齐辅赶忙锁上机务股的大门，对工人们说：“机器是我们的命，绝不能让他们破坏了。咱们好好保护着，交代给解放军，铁路很快就能通石家庄了。”工人们坚毅顽强，始终不离机器，直至解放军入城，机车、车厢和机房重要零件均完好无损。少数不肖分子企图乘乱抢劫，均被工人劝止。解放军入城后，迅即成立保定铁路管制委员会，积极筹备复工。当天就有一百七十个工人报名登记。躲避蒋匪抓丁而藏至四乡的工人，也陆续回家，赴管委会报到。工人们自动组成纠察队，在车站一带维持秩序。
