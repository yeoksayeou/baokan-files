(Hebei-Shandong-Henan Dispatch) In the newly recovered areas of Hebei-Shandong-Henan, which have not undergone land reform, concealed land is a widespread problem. During this autumn grain collection, in order to expand the area of collection and make the burden on the masses reasonable, some areas universally mobilized the masses to report concealed land themselves while rectifying burden land. In Dongming Chengguan District, during the enemy's rule, there were many forms of concealing land: (1) Collective concealed land, such as in Beiguan, which was concealed at a rate of "75%" (i.e., paying the burden for 7.5 mu out of every 10 mu). (2) Bribing enemy financial and grain personnel to privately "transfer" the land. (3) Landlords dispersing or falsely selling land. (4) When buying land, only wanting the land but not the burden (i.e., not transferring the burden). Based on this, during the autumn grain collection arrangement, the district cadres first explained at the village cadre meeting that finding concealed land was to increase national income, defeat Chiang Kai-shek as soon as possible, and make the burden fair and reasonable. After understanding this meaning, the village cadres actively promoted it and seriously registered the land. In Beiguan, the fact that two landlord households concealed 60 mu of land, more than all the land owned by several poor peasant families, was used to illustrate that concealing land only benefited a few landlords and rich peasants, and everyone else suffered. This quickly awakened the masses, who reported themselves and reported others. As a result, all 3.4 hectares of concealed land in the district were uncovered. Nanmen Street uncovered 12.5 hectares of concealed land, and Beimen Street uncovered more than 7.55 hectares. The district uncovered a total of 25.94 hectares of concealed land, increasing the income of public grain by more than 44,000 jin. Furthermore, Linze First District was previously an area bordering the enemy, and concealed land was also widespread. During this autumn grain collection, after deep and extensive propaganda to the masses, it was proposed to report concealed land voluntarily, with lenient treatment, without investigation or punishment. In villages where the work was better, branch party members and village cadres took the lead in reporting themselves, and mobilized the masses to expose and report on each other. As a result, the entire district reported 222 hectares of concealed land within seven days.

    冀鲁豫河南群众
    自报黑地整理负担
    【冀鲁豫电】我冀鲁豫河南未经过土改的新收复区，普遍存有黑地。此次秋征中为扩大征收面积，使群众负担合理，有些地区在整理负担地中，普遍进行了发动群众自报黑地。东明城关区过去在敌人统治时期，瞒黑地形式很多：（一）集体黑地，如北关即是按“七成五”瞒的（即十亩出七亩五分的负担）。（二）贿赂敌财粮人员，私自将地假“过拨”。（三）地主将地分散、假卖。（四）买地时光要地不要差（即不过拨）。据此，区干在布置秋征中，首先在村干会上说明查出黑地是为了增加国家收入，早日打倒蒋贼并使负担公平合理。村干了解这种意义后，便积极起来进行宣传，认真登记土地。在北关，更用二户地主瞒黑地六十亩比几家贫农所有土地都多的事实，说明瞒黑地只有少数地富沾光，大家都吃他的亏，这样群众很快的觉悟起来，纷纷自报，并检举别人，结果该关三顷四十亩黑地全部搞出。南门街查出黑地十二顷五十余亩，北门街亦查出黑地七顷五十五亩多。该区共查出黑地二十五顷九十四亩，增加了四万四千余斤公粮的收入。又临泽一区过去是接敌区，黑地亦普遍存在，此次秋征中，经过深入广泛地向群众宣传，并提出自报黑地、宽大处理、不追不罚。在工作较好的村子，即通过支部党员、村干带头自报，并发动群众互相揭发与检举。因此全区在七天内亦报出黑地二百二十二顷。
