　　North China Government and Military Region Issue Directive to All Administrative Offices:
  　Strengthen Unified Struggle Against the Enemy, Establish Committee for Struggle Against the Enemy
    [Our Newspaper] The North China People's Government and the North China Military Region, in order to unify the forces for struggle against the enemy in the border areas, have decided to establish a Committee for Struggle Against the Enemy and jointly issued a directive to all administrative offices to comply with and implement it. The directive states: Border area struggle against the enemy (including political, economic, and armed struggle) must have a unified pace and coordination to concentrate forces and strike at the enemy. Otherwise, it will mutually offset forces, reduce efficiency, inconvenience merchants and travelers, and allow bad elements to take advantage of gaps. In order to unify the political, economic, and armed struggle against the enemy, it is hereby decided: 1. Each administrative region shall establish a Committee for Struggle Against the Enemy, organized by responsible cadres from the respective administrative office and military region, as well as public security, industry and commerce (import and export bureaus), and other relevant departments. 2. The tasks of the Committee for Struggle Against the Enemy are: to resolve issues of mutual coordination between departments, determine tasks for struggle against the enemy for a certain period, eliminate contradictions between departments, and, under the principle of not violating the policies and laws of the North China People's Government, the committee has the power to make decisions and order various departments to implement them. 3. In border areas, local armed forces leaders, import and export sub-bureaus, and central public security outposts may also organize Committees for Struggle Against the Enemy, under the leadership of the superior Committee for Struggle Against the Enemy. 4. The Import and Export Committee (jointly organized by the Import and Export Bureau, banks, and stores) decided upon by the North China Foreign Trade Conference may still exist to resolve daily specific issues such as foreign exchange and exchange rates in the economic struggle against the enemy.
    [Another Dispatch] The North China People's Government, in order to consolidate border defenses, prevent espionage and banditry, and protect the safety of merchants and travelers, has decided to establish border defense public security offices, border defense public security bureaus, waterborne public security bureaus, and river defense public security bureaus in various border defense zones to strengthen import and export control work in border areas. It is decided to establish border defense public security bureaus in the Daqing River area of central Hebei, western Hebei, Anyang, and Xinxiang; river defense public security bureaus along the Yellow River in the Taiyue and Hebei-Shandong-Henan areas; a waterborne public security bureau on the Fuyang River in southern Hebei; and a border defense public security office in Baoding.
