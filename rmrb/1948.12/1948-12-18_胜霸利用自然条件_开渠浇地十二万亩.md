[Ji Zhong Electric] The Sheng Ba (newly established county) County Party Committee and County Government, based on the natural conditions of the Daqing River and Zhongting River within the county, organized farmers to open canals for irrigation. The irrigated area has now reached 123,241 mu and is continuing to expand. This autumn, the county experienced little rain and dry land. In addition to a small amount of wheat planted on reserved wheat land, much of the stubble land was not planted with wheat. Moreover, due to dry and hard soil and a lack of animal power, much of the land could not be autumn-plowed. This not only affects next year's wheat harvest, but also presents difficulties for next year's spring plowing and sowing. In September and October, the masses in villages such as Daningkou in the Second District spontaneously dug ditches to draw water from the Zhongting River to irrigate about 30,000 mu of land. This matter attracted the attention of the County Party Committee, which reviewed its past failure to pay enough attention to the production needs of the masses, neglecting to actively lead this work. It then conducted a water conservancy survey and research, absorbed the experience of farmers, and formulated a concrete plan for opening canals for irrigation. It was decided that the County Industry Department and the Promotion Society would dispatch key cadres to combine with district cadres in the beneficiary area to organize a "Canal Opening and Irrigation Committee" to be specifically responsible for promoting and leading this work. The County Party Secretary and County Head also personally visited and guided the irrigation area. Each village also organized a mobilization committee to be responsible for mobilizing manpower and materials. In order to ensure the fairness and rationality of work attendance, a system of combining people and land was implemented, with work assigned by section and paid according to the amount of work completed for digging ditches, opening canals, and repairing sluices. In addition, command posts were jointly formed by three to five villages according to the irrigated area and sluice gate water release units to specifically manage water release and irrigation. Whenever someone's land was being irrigated, they would watch over it. Each village took turns sending people to guard the sluice gates and main lines, and militia members patrolled day and night to prevent sabotage. The completed project is more than ten miles long, and can draw water from the Daqing River into the Zhongting River, blocking the lower reaches of the Zhongting River (east of Taishan) to irrigate the land north of the river. Branch lines, lateral ditches and water diversion ditches were dug on both sides of the Taishan River to irrigate the land on both sides of the river. In total, 123,241 mu can be irrigated. If all of this can be irrigated this year, it is estimated that each mu will increase production by three shi dou next year, for a total increase of more than 36,000 shi. The construction of this project has given the people in this area great benefits. The masses in Daningkou said, "With this irrigation, our village can plant fifteen qing of spring wheat next year, and we can also plant spring seedlings early. If we harvest, we can get a 90% yield."

　　胜霸利用自然条件
    开渠浇地十二万亩
    【冀中电】胜霸（新设县）县委与县政府，根据该县境内之大清河、中亭河自然条件，组织农民开渠浇地，现已开拓浇地面积达十二万三千二百四十一亩，并正在继续扩大中。该县今年秋季雨少地干，除少数留麦地种上麦子外，很多的楂耙地都未种上麦子。又因土地干硬、畜力缺乏，许多土地未能秋耕。这样不但使明年麦收受影响，而明年春耕播种也会呈现困难。九、十月间，二区大宁口等村群众自动挖沟引中亭河水浇地三万亩左右。此事引起了县委注意，检讨了过去对群众的生产要求重视不够，忽视了主动领导这一工作。随即做了水利调查研究，吸收了农民的经验，制定了开渠浇地的具体计划，决定由县实业科、推进社抽出主要干部结合受益区区干部组织了“开渠浇地委员会”，专责推动与领导这一工作。县委书记和县长也亲到浇地区视察与指导工作。各村也组织了动员委员会，负责动员人力物力。为了出工的公平合理。实行了人地合夫，分节按活计工，完成挖沟、开渠、修闸。另外按浇地面积和闸口放水单位，三、五村联合组成指挥部，专门管理放水浇地。每到浇谁家的地，谁去看着。各村轮流出人看守闸口和干线，并有民兵昼夜巡查，以防破坏。现已完竣的工程，全长十来里，能引大清河水入中亭河，把中亭河下游（台山东）塞死，浇该河北岸的地。并在台山河两侧挖了支线和横沟及引水沟，浇河两侧的地。总计能浇十二万三千二百四十一亩。今年如能全部浇完，估计明年每亩增产三市斗，总计能增产三万六千余石。此工程的建设，给予该地区群众极大福利，大宁口的群众说：“这一浇地，明年咱村能种上十五顷春麦，还能早早种上春苗，要收了就能得九成年景。”
