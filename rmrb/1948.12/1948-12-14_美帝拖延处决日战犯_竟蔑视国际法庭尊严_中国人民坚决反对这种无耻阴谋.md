Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, December 11th: After the Far East International Military Tribunal concluded the trial of 25 major Japanese war criminals, MacArthur and the U.S. judicial authorities are carrying out a shameless conspiracy to delay the execution and even change the original verdict. This fact deserves the serious attention of the Chinese people. Although the verdict of the Far East Tribunal is not entirely satisfactory, after the verdict was announced, the war criminals sentenced to death by hanging, Doihara Kenji and Hirota Koki, those sentenced to life imprisonment, Kido Koichi, Oka Takazumi, Sato Kenryo, Shimada Shigetaro, and Togo Shigenori, who was sentenced to imprisonment for a fixed term, under MacArthur's direction, appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court at the end of November, demanding the reversal of the original verdict. The appeal openly slandered that "the International Tribunal was illegally established, and the conviction is a violation of the U.S. Constitution." MacArthur himself also issued a statement on November 30th, expressing support for the appeal of the seven war criminals. He said: "The execution of the seven Japanese war criminals sentenced to hanging must await the decision of the U.S. Supreme Court, and will not be carried out before the court takes action." MacArthur openly placed the solemn international tribunal under the U.S. judicial organs. The U.S. Supreme Court has shamelessly decided on the 6th to accept the appeal of the Japanese war criminals in order to delay the execution and even change the original verdict. This arbitrary behavior of the United States has led the British representative of the Allied Council for Japan, Mr. Shaw, to state on the 6th: "The U.S. Supreme Court's re-examination of the Japanese war criminals' verdict is a blow to the legal status of the Allied military tribunal, and it is considered that the military tribunal is not international in nature, but was established by the U.S. President." According to a Tokyo Kyodo News Agency dispatch on the 6th: "The U.S. Supreme Court's decision to accept the appeal of the Japanese war criminals has aroused anger among most Japanese people over the possible exemption of the war criminals." A Reuters dispatch on the 7th also stated that the U.S. move "has caused widespread surprise among the Japanese."

Prior to this, MacArthur advocated strict secrecy regarding the execution of war criminals such as Tojo, which are closely related to the people of the Far East, especially the Chinese people, and the U.S. side arrogantly declared that this was "absolutely a U.S. affair." They decided: no announcement would be made in advance, the time and place of execution would be kept strictly confidential; during the execution, in addition to a few U.S. official execution supervisors, representatives of other allied countries and any journalists would be strictly prohibited from participating; and no photos of the war criminals' bodies would be allowed after the event, and they would be secretly buried. MacArthur's sneaky behavior has aroused suspicion that he is playing an ulterior motive. MacArthur's agreement to sentence Tojo and others to hanging this time was due to mass pressure, and he fully admitted this in his reply to the verdict of the Far East International Military Tribunal. The book begins by saying: "I have held public office for a long time, but what I am most reluctant to do is to review the crimes and sentences of the Japanese war criminals by the Far East International Military Tribunal."

    美帝拖延处决日战犯
    竟蔑视国际法庭尊严
    中国人民坚决反对这种无耻阴谋
    【新华社陕北十一日电】在远东国际军事法庭结束日本二十五名主要战犯审判后，麦克阿瑟及美国司法当局正实行拖延处决以至改变原判的无耻阴谋。此一事实值得中国人民的严重注意。虽然远东法庭的判决并不能令人完全满意，但在判决书宣读以后，被判处绞刑的土肥原贤一、广田弘毅，被判处无期徒刑的木户幸一、冈敬纯、佐藤贤了、岛田繁太郎，及被判处有期徒刑的东乡茂德等七名战犯，虽然在麦克阿瑟的示意下，却于十一月底向美国最高法院提出上诉，要求取消原判。上诉书并公开诬蔑“国际法庭乃非法成立者，其所定罪名系违反美国宪法之举”。麦克阿瑟本人，亦于十一月三十日发表声明，对七战犯的上诉，表示支持。他说：“关于处决被判绞刑的日本七名战犯一事，尚须等待美国最高法院之决定，在该法院采取行动前决不执行”。麦克阿瑟公然将庄严的国际法庭，置于美国司法机关之下。美国最高法院已厚颜无耻地于六日决定受理日本战犯上诉事件，以便拖延处决以至改变原判。美国这种专横的行为，使盟国对日委员会的英国代表萧氏，也不得不于六日表示：“美国最高法院重新审定日本战犯之判决书，乃为对盟国军事法庭合法地位之打击，亦即认为军事法庭非国际性质，而为美国总统所设。”又据东京共同通讯社六日电称：“美国最高法院之决定受理日本战犯上诉事件，已引起多数日本人士对战犯之可能获免，表示愤怒。”路透社七日电亦称，美国此举“已引起日人的普遍惊异。”
    在此以前，麦克阿瑟对于与远东人民、特别是与中国人民有切身关系的东条等战犯的执刑问题，曾主张严守秘密，美方并曾狂妄地宣告这是“绝对的美国事务”。他们决定：事先不发公告，执刑之时间与地点严守秘密；执刑时除少数美国官方监刑人外，严禁其他盟国代表及任何记者参加；事后也不准拍摄战犯尸体之照片，并将秘密埋葬。麦克阿瑟这种鬼祟行为，已引起人们怀疑他正从中玩弄不可告人的阴谋。麦氏此次同意判处东条等绞刑，本是出于群众的压力，在他发表的对日本战犯判决书的复判书中，完全承认了这点。该书开头即称：“本人担任公职颇久，然本心所不愿为而不得不为者，莫过于此次复判远东国际军事法庭对日本战犯所判之罪刑。”（美国新闻处十一月二十五日东京电）
