　　【Taiyue Telegram】The Yuanshan You Coal Mine Cooperative, affiliated with the Yuabei Joint Cooperative, has organized the masses to transport scrap iron, resulting in substantial profits. The cooperative contracted to transport over 600,000 jin of scrap iron from Lingshi to Changzhi. This 500-li journey involved crossing the Gaoshan Ridge at the border of Lingshi and Qinyuan, impassable for livestock. Initially, the cooperative organized people from the first and third districts of Lingshi to carry it on their backs, earning one yuan per jin. Many could carry up to eighty jin. Some women also participated in this transportation, earning more than forty yuan a day, equivalent to over a dou of rice at the then-current grain prices. To make the road passable for both people and livestock, it was repaired, which encouraged more people to participate in the carrying. Not only were the people and livestock of Lingshi willing to carry, but the livestock from the third district of Qinyuan were also organized. Where carts could be used, over 1,300 vehicles from Qinyuan, Qin County, Tunliu, and Changzhi were organized to transport the iron all the way to Changzhi. To ensure the masses did not encounter difficulties during transportation, temporary shops were set up along the route after mobilizing the local population, and shops were rented in Changzhi. Due to meticulous organization and planning, the task, originally scheduled to take four months, was completed in two months, from October to early December. For example, when carts arrived at the transportation station, the dispatchers ensured that the masses were not delayed in loading. Through this organized mass transportation, the masses benefited greatly. For instance, the third district of Qinyuan significantly increased its livestock. Han Hongyi Village added six head of cattle, the Zeshan Zhang household added ten donkeys, and Shangshe added nine mules, among others.

　　岳北元山友煤矿合作社
  　组织运废铁
  　得利买牲口
    【太岳电】岳北联社所属元山友煤矿社，组织群众运废铁，获利很大。该社包下由灵石运往长治的六十多万斤废铁，在这五百里的路程中，要经过灵石、沁源交界的高山岭，牲口不能行走。一开始，便组织灵石一、三区群众往上扛，每斤能赚一元，多的能扛八十斤。还有些妇女也参加这一运输，往返一天也能赚四十多元。以当时粮价计算，一天可赚米一斗多。为了使人和牲口都能通行，又把路重新修理了一下，这样使群众都来参加驮运。不仅灵石群众、牲口愿意驮送，并且把沁源三区的牲口也组织起来驮运。到能行车的地方，前后又组织了沁源、沁县、屯留、长治等县一千三百多辆车，一直运往长治。为了使群众在起运中不受困难，事先在沿路地区发动群众开设了临时店房，在长治又包下了店房。由于组织和计划的周密，原订四个月完成，结果从十月到十二月初两个月的时间使完成了。如车到运输站时，收发的保证了不耽误群众装车。经过这次组织群众运输，使群众得利很大。如沁源三区即增加了不少的牲口。韩洪一村即增加牛六头，泽山掌户增加毛驴十头，上舍增加骡子九头等。
