Lingchuan County Cooperative
    Promotes Local Products, Supplies Necessities
    [Taihang News] Since the Lingchuan County Cooperative corrected its focus on pure profit and turned to organizing the masses to produce and sell local products, it has achieved considerable success in the past two months. After review and rectification at the September cooperative affairs meeting, the cooperative first transformed its retail department into a wholesale supply station for village cooperatives and peddlers to sell local products. It was decided that local hemp production would be the main focus of operations. In October and November, it sold more than 49,000 catties of black and white hemp, earning 62,500 yuan (new currency, same below); and supported six hemp firms. In addition, it purchased more than 4,000 catties of useless broken bags, rope ends, waste paper, etc., from the masses, paying 13,000 yuan. This enabled the masses to turn waste into capital for production. In November, it also organized the livestock power of 16 villages to transport more than 20,000 catties of hemp, and the masses earned more than 34,000 yuan in silver. During the autumn harvest this year, the masses needed edible salt, homespun cloth, and cotton. At that time, the county cooperative transported these items and exchanged them for local products such as walnuts and medicinal materials from the masses through district and village cooperatives. This not only solved the necessities needed by the masses, but also helped the masses sell local products, supported district and village cooperatives, and strengthened business relationships. In particular, the relationship with the masses has become closer. Now the cooperative's working capital has increased from 150,000 to 200,000 yuan; and the net profit earned in three months is 130,000 yuan. At the same time, the morale of the cooperative's staff is extremely high.

　　陵川县联社
    推销土产品供给必需品
    【太行讯】陵川县联社自纠正单纯营利、转向组织群众生产推销土产后，两月来已获得相当成绩。该社自九月社务会议经过检讨与整顿后，首先将门市部转为批发供给村社及小贩推销土产货栈，当地产麻决定以经营麻业为主。在十、十一两个月内，共推销黑白麻四万九千余斤，获利六万二千五百元（新币、下同）；并支持了六家麻行。另外又收买了群众无用的破套、绳头、废纸等四千余斤，付款一万三千余元。使群众将废物变成资金投入生产。在十一月份还组织了十六个村的畜力，运麻等二万余斤。群众得洋三万四千余元。今年过秋时，群众需要食盐、土布、棉花，当时县联社便将这些东西运来，通过区社、村社来换群众的核桃、药材等土产。这样不但解决了群众所需要的必需品，而且又扶助群众推销了土产，同时也支持了区社、村社、密切了业务关系。特别是与群众关系也更加密切了。现在该社活动资金由十五万增至二十万；三个月获纯利十三万元。同时该社职员情绪极高。
