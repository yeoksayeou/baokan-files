  　Vigorously Supports Native Cloth Production, Improves Quality, and Expands Sales Channels
    [Hebei-Shandong-Henan Telegram] The Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region Trade Company has formulated measures for organizing native cloth production in order to vigorously support its production, improve its quality, and expand its sales channels. The Hebei-Shandong-Henan region was originally a well-known native cloth producing area. Except for the Qingfeng, Nanle, Guancheng, and Chaocheng areas, which specialize in straw braid, native cloth is generally produced throughout the region, with the copper city cloth of Yuncheng, Dingtao, and Dong'a being particularly famous. Before the Anti-Japanese War, in addition to self-sufficiency, the region's native cloth was also sold in large quantities to Taihang, central Shandong, and southern Shandong. However, at that time, due to the suppression of foreign cloth dumping, the profit from native cloth production was very low, earning only the equivalent of two or three liters of grain per bolt. During the Anti-Japanese War, thanks to the strong support of the democratic government, allowing them to earn one or two dou of grain per bolt of cloth during the famine of 1943, which could maintain the minimum living standard of one or two people, the enthusiasm of women for spinning and weaving greatly increased, and production volume also significantly increased compared to before the war. In some families, income from women's spinning and weaving accounted for the majority of sideline production. Taking the production and disaster relief in the fourth and eighth sub-regions this spring as an example, the trade company absorbed more than 20.69 million square feet of native cloth in these two sub-regions, and the masses benefited by 177 million yuan, which, calculated at the grain prices at that time, solved the livelihoods of more than 177,000 people for two months. However, at present, the quality of native cloth throughout the region, with the exception of a few areas, is generally very low, and the organization methods are unscientific. Wide, narrow, long, short, good, and bad are all packed together. Some are packed into square bundles, and some are packed into round bundles, which are not convenient for calculation or transportation, thus greatly affecting sales. Especially in the fourth and eighth sub-regions, the packaging and quality are very poor. Foreign merchants even proposed "No matter how cheap, we don't want the western Hebei-Shandong-Henan cloth (referring to the fourth and eighth sub-region cloth)." This has also greatly weakened the turnover of national funds to support mass production. The state-owned store Defengyu alone had 4 billion yuan of funds tied up this spring due to the accumulation of native cloth. In order to open up native cloth sales channels, accelerate the turnover of national funds, and ensure the expanded reproduction of native cloth, it is necessary to improve the quality of native cloth and improve packaging. The trade company specifically formulated the "Native Cloth Organization Measures" in mid-month based on the instructions of the North China Trade General Company for organizing native cloth, and assigned them to its affiliated state-owned stores for execution, and widely publicized them to the masses, so that every household would know and jointly improve native cloth production.

  　大力扶植土布生产提高质量扩展销路
    【冀鲁豫电】冀鲁豫区贸易公司，为了大力扶植土布生产，特制定土布整理办法，以提高质量，扩展销路。冀鲁豫原为有名的土布产区，除清丰、南乐、观城、朝城一带因特产草帽辫外，一般地区均普遍出产土布，尤以郓城、定陶及东阿之铜城布更为著称。抗日战争前，全区土布除自给外，更大量向太行、鲁中、鲁南运销，但当时因受洋布倾销的压制，土布生产利润很低，每匹只能赚到三、二升粮食的代价。抗日时期，由于民主政府大力扶持，允其一九四三年灾荒期间，每匹布赚到一、二斗粮食，能维持一二人的最低生活，因之，妇女纺织情绪大为提高，生产量较战前也显见增加，有些妇女纺织收入竟占家庭副业生产的绝大部分。即以今春四、八分区的生产救灾来说，贸易公司在该两分区吸收土布二千零六十九万余方尺，群众得利十七万万七千余万元，按当时粮价计算，解决了十七万七千余人两个月的生活。但目前全区土布除少数几个地区外，一般质量都很低，整装办法也不科学，宽的、窄的、长的、短的、好的、坏的都整装在一起，有的装成方捆，有的装成圆捆，既不便于计算，又不便于运输，因之在销路上受到很大影响。尤其四、八分区，在包装上与质量上都非常差，外路客商甚至提出“贵贱不要冀鲁豫西路布（指四、八分区布）”。在周转国家资金扶植群众生产上亦大受削弱，仅公营商店德丰玉一家，今春吸收之土布即积压资金达四十亿。为了打开土布销路，加速国家资金周转，保障土布扩大再生产，必须提高土布质量，改善整装。贸易公司特于本月中旬根据华北贸易总公司土布整装指示，制定“土布整理办法”，分设所属各公营商店执行，并向群众广泛宣传，使家喻户晓，共同改进土布生产。
