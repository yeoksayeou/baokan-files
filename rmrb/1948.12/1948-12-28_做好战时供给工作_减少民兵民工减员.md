　　【Jizhong 18th dispatch】In order to reduce casualties among civilian laborers and militia, it is essential to do a good job in wartime supply work. This is an important lesson learned by Hejian County in its past support for the front. In previous battles such as the North of Daqing River, Baoding North, and Chahar South campaigns, many of the supply personnel in the county were unqualified. For example, they were illiterate, unable to calculate accounts, and did not understand the regulations and reimbursement procedures, which resulted in serious overspending and waste. In addition, some supply management personnel only managed the distribution of grain, firewood, and vegetable money, and did not organize and lead efforts to improve living conditions, which affected the consolidation of the civilian labor teams. Based on the supply work in the above battles, the following two points of experience were gained:
　　How to equip supply cadres?
　　Each brigade or detachment (county) should have one supply director, who should be a member of the county finance section; one accountant, who should be an accountant from the finance section; and one supply clerk, who should be a finance cadre. Each company should have one quartermaster, who should be a finance and grain assistant. Each platoon should have one staff sergeant, who should be a finance and grain cadre. The supply personnel of the brigade or detachment directly receive grain, firewood, and vegetable money from the commissioner's office. They must prepare a budget when receiving the money, and a roster must be prepared for reimbursement. The company supply clerk is responsible for receiving grain, firewood, and vegetable money from the detachment (county), keeping track of the number of people in the company, adhering to the system, preparing a budget at the beginning of the month, and submitting a roster and budget for reimbursement at the end of the month. Each platoon's staff sergeant should be responsible for managing the cooks, cooking by platoon during wartime, and being responsible for adhering to the system. Usually, meals are prepared by company, and each day there should be personnel assigned to "vegetable duty" on a rotating basis from each squad. The supply clerk, quartermaster, and cooks live together and form a "kitchen squad," which is responsible for holding meetings and assigning tasks under the leadership of the supply clerk. Matters such as receiving grain, firewood, and buying vegetables should be reviewed by the person on vegetable duty. Each team should establish a food committee, with one person democratically elected from each platoon to form the committee together with the kitchen squad. The kitchen squad holds a brief meeting every evening, with the participation of the living committee members and the person on vegetable duty. The content of the meeting is that the living committee introduces the opinions of the civilian laborers on the food, and comes up with ways to improve it based on the feedback from the lower levels. The person on vegetable duty reports the accounts for the day and also participates in giving opinions on the food. During wartime, especially when militia need to cook by platoon or squad, the leadership should not emphasize collectivism. For example, if it is by platoon, the grain coupons should be issued to the platoon sergeant, who is responsible for adhering to the system and for reimbursement. The food committee should meet once every three days, because it is not possible to meet once a day during wartime; however, special meetings can be convened in special circumstances.
　　How to comply with the system and improve food at the same time?
　　The number of people must be accurately tracked, especially during wartime or marching, and cases of illness and straggling must be reported in a timely manner. Before departure, each company must bring its own oil bucket, a kitchen knife, and a marching pot, and each person must bring a rice bag and a small bowl. Before departure, the oil bucket must be filled with oil and the rice bag must be filled with grain. When about to engage in combat, one day's worth of cooked dry food must be carried. In general areas where conditions are better, do not bring cooked food, just do the preparation work, because if you bring cooked food, the civilian laborers will not adhere to the system and will eat it early. Or bring it together and do not distribute it to individuals. In the initial stage after civilian laborers and militia are assembled, attention should be paid to thrift. This is the easiest time to save, because first, the civilian laborers have just come out of their homes and are unwilling to eat millet, and their morale is unstable and they eat less; second, some bring some money with them and secretly buy snacks to eat, so they also eat less rice. For example, during the Chahar South campaign, in the initial stage of assembly, each company of one hundred and twenty people had enough to eat if rice was allocated for one hundred and ten people. Some companies strictly adhered to the system and allocated rice, but as a result, they could not finish it, and throwing it away or giving it to the landlords was a waste. At this time, it is also necessary to prevent the bad habits of grabbing food and scooping up large bowls during meals, otherwise some people eat slowly and are not full; some are afraid of not being full and try to scoop up large bowls, but as a result, they cannot finish it and dare not return it, so they force themselves to eat it or put it in their own food bags, and some secretly throw it on the roof. In this way, eating a full meal and then a hungry one will cause illness and desertion. In the front, the vegetable money is all issued in cash, which is not enough to eat ordinary vegetables. During the Chahar South campaign, the Fifth Company bought millet with the surplus vegetable money and saved one hundred and ten catties of rice equivalent in thirteen days. This one hundred and ten catties of rice was used to solve practical problems, such as making up for the rice lost when climbing a mountain, and making up for the rice lost when improving the lives of the sick, solving the problem and adhering to the system. The Third Company did not adopt this method, but instead gave the surplus vegetable money to the civilian laborers to buy snacks, resulting in the inability to solve the rice shortage during combat and mountain climbing, causing the civilian laborers to beg for food, desert, and harming their health.

### 做好战时供给工作  减少民兵民工减员

　　做好战时供给工作
    减少民兵民工减员
    【冀中十八日电】为减少民工民兵的减员，首先要做好战时供给工作，这是河间县历次支前中带领民工的重要经验。该县在过去大清河北、保北、察南等战役中的供给人员很多不称职，如不识字，不会算帐，不知道制度和报销手续等，因此造成了严重的超支浪费现象。还有的供管人员，只管发粮柴和菜金，不去组织领导改善生活，以致影响到民工队的巩固。根据以上几个战役的供给工作，得到以下两点经验：
    怎样配备供给干部？
    大队或支队（县），设供给主任一人，由县财政科员担任；会计一人，由财政科会计担任；供给员一人，由财政干部担任。连队设司务长一人，由财粮协助员担任。每排设上士一人，由财粮干部担任。大队或支队的供给人员直接向专署领取粮柴菜金，领取时要造好预算；报销时要有花名册计算。连队供给员，负责向支队（县）领取粮柴菜金，掌握连队人数，坚持制度，月初造预算，月终要付花名册、造预算报销。每排的上士要掌握管理炊事人员，战时分排做饭，负责掌握制度。平时以连队为单位做饭，每天要有值菜的人员，由各班轮流。供给员、司务长、炊事员生活在一起，组成“伙房班”，由供给员负责掌握开会和分工。领粮、领柴、买菜等事情，要经过值菜日的人审查。每个队都要建立伙食委员会，由各排民主选举一人，与伙房班合组而成。伙房班每天晚上开碰头会，生活委员和值菜日的人都参加，碰头会内容是由生活委员会介绍民工对伙食的意见，根据下层反映的意见来想办法改进。值菜日的人报告今天的帐目，对伙食也参加意见。战时特别是民兵须要排或班为单位做饭的时候，领导上不要强调集体。如以排为单位，粮票发至排上士，由他掌握制度和负责报销。伙食委员会改为三天一次，因为战时不可能一天一次了；但特殊情况下可临时召开。
    怎样做到遵守制度又能改善伙食？
    要把人数掌握正确，特别在战时或行军时，病号的发生和掉队的情形，要及时上报。出发前，每连队要自带油桶一付、菜刀一把、行军锅一口，每人要带米袋一条，小碗一个。出发前油桶要上好油米袋要装好粮食。将要投入战斗时，要带一天的熟干粮。在一般地区情况较好的情形下，不要带熟食，只把准备工作做好就行，因为带了熟食，民工不坚持制度早早就吃掉了。或者带的时候就集中带，不要分发到个人身上。当民工民兵集合后的初期，要注意节约。这时最容易节约，因为一来民工才从家里出来，吃小米饭还不愿吃，情绪不安定吃的少；二来有的带点钱出来，偷买零食吃，也就少吃饭。如察南战役时，集合起来的初期，每连一百二十个人，按一百一十个人下米就够吃。有的连队死按制度下米结果吃不了，扔掉给了房东都是浪费。这时还要防止开饭时抢吃和盛大碗的坏作风，不然有的吃饭慢，吃不饱；有的怕吃不饱尽量盛大碗，结果吃不了也不敢交回，就强吃或放入自己干粮袋里，还有的偷着扔在房上。这样，饥一顿饱一顿，会造成发生病号和逃跑的现象。在前方菜金都是折款发给，要吃一般菜蔬用不清。察南战役时，第五中队把节余的菜金买成小米，十三天节余了一百一十斤的米折款。把这一百一十斤米用在解决实际问题当中，如爬一座山亏的米数补上了，病号改善生活亏的米也补上了，解决了问题还掌握了制度。第三中队没采用这办法，而是为把节余的菜金给了民工们买了零食吃，结果在战斗中和爬山时亏米不能解决，造成了民工讨饭吃，开小差，并妨害了民工的身体健康。
