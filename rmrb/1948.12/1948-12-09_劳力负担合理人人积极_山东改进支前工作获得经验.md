Xinhua News Agency, East China, 8th: According to Shandong's experience, correctly resolving the assessment of labor for supporting the front lines and clearing up the accounts of support work, so that the people's burden of supporting the front is fair and reasonable, is an important link in increasing the source of manpower to support the front lines and improving the people's enthusiasm for supporting the front lines. In the past, in organizing the people's work to support the front lines in Shandong, there were some unfair and unreasonable phenomena, such as village cadres not working, some village cadres also sheltering some people from not working, small merchants and craftsmen often not working, and a few backward party members and militiamen also not working, while active party members and militiamen worked more, and honest farmers also worked more. This reduced the number of people contributing to support the front lines, affecting the people's enthusiasm for supporting the front lines, and also affecting the people's production. According to a survey in the Second District of Lunan Central District, if the burden is fair, even if the civilian labor supporting the front lines accounts for 10% of the total population, it will not affect production. In order to support the Jinan front lines, this district sent nearly 100,000 standing and temporary civilian laborers in September. This number has reached 10% of the total population, and the remaining 90% of the population can still maintain production without being affected.

To make the people's burden of supporting the front lines fair and reasonable, it is necessary to correctly solve the two problems of assessing labor and clearing work accounts. According to the experience of the Sixth District of Lunan Central District, the assessment of labor should be democratically discussed by the villagers. The age of labor should be the main standard during the assessment, followed by physical strength; it is unreasonable to only consider age regardless of physical strength or only consider physical strength regardless of age. If village cadres meet the standards of age and physical strength, they should also work like ordinary villagers. As for their method of using office work to offset labor and the order of work, it can be reasonably assessed by the villagers according to the specific circumstances of the village.

Secondly, the work accounts of the civilian laborers supporting the front lines must be cleared regularly. Those that have not been cleared in the past should be cleared immediately. When clearing past work accounts, those with complete work accounts can settle the work accounts for the past or last year and announce the results to the villagers. Those who have worked more should be commended, and those who have worked less or even not at all should be announced that they must make up for it in the future. However, when making up for work, consideration should be given to whether there are difficulties in their families, and they should not be required to make up for it all at once, so as not to affect production. For those with incomplete or no work accounts at all, the workers can report themselves, the masses can discuss publicly, or they can report each other and discuss each other during the clearing. In this case, the time should not be calculated for too long. After the past work accounts have been cleared, accounts should be kept at any time from now on. The work accounts of the newly assessed personnel who are working to support the front lines should be calculated from the time they are of age. Carts, pockets, and livestock used to support the front lines should be used to offset labor. As for how much to offset, it can be democratically assessed by the masses and submitted to the government for unified regulations.

### 劳力负担合理人人积极　山东改进支前工作获得经验

　　劳力负担合理人人积极
  　山东改进支前工作获得经验
    【新华社华东八日电】根据山东经验，正确解决评定支援前线的劳力与清理支援前线的工帐问题，使人民的支前负担公平合理，是增加支援前线人力来源，提高人民支援前线积极性的重要环节。过去山东在组织人民支援前线的工作中，存在着若干不公平不合理的现象，如村干部不出工，有的村干部还包庇一部分人不出工，小商人、手艺工人多不出工，少数落后党员与民兵也不出工，而积极的党员、民兵则多出工，老实的农民也多出工。这样便使出力支援前线的人数减少，影响了人民支援前线的积极性，同时也影响了人民的生产。据鲁中南区二分区调查，如果负担公平，即使支援前线民工占全人口百分之十，也不会影响生产。为了支援济南前线，该分区在九月份曾出常备与临时民工近十万人，此数已达全人口百分之十，其余百分之九十的人口仍能维持生产不受影响。
    要使人民的支援前线负担公平合理，必须正确解决评定劳力与清理工帐两个问题。根据鲁中南六分区的经验，评定劳力应由村民民主讨论，评时应以出工年龄为主要标准，其次再看体力；只按年龄不管体力或只按体力不管年龄都是不合理的。村干部如果年龄体力都合乎标准，也应和普通村民一样出工。至于他们以办公顶工的办法及出工的先后，可由村民根据本村具体情况合理评定。
    其次，支援前线的民工工帐必须定期清理，过去未清理过的，应立即开始清理。在清理过去工帐时，工帐完整的，可结算过去或去年一年的工帐，将结果向村民公布。出工多的应予表扬，出工少甚至不出工的，应宣布要在今后补足。但在补工时，应照顾其家中有无困难，不一定令其一次补足，以免影响生产。工帐不全或完全没有工帐的，清理时可由出工人自报，群众公议，或互相报，互相评议。在这种情况下，时间不应算得过久。过去的工帐清理完毕，今后即应随时记帐。新评定的出工支援前线的人员，其工帐应从适龄时算起。支援前线时的车子、口袋、牲畜应当顶工，至于顶工多少、可由群众民主评定后提交政府统一规定。
