Xinhua News Agency, Xing County, 15th. It has been discovered that winter production plans are unrealistic or cannot be implemented in individual areas of the Jin-Sui Liberated Zone. The textile plan of a certain district in Lishi County, based on the fact that "women account for half" of the 8,000 people in the district, has proven impossible to realize in practice. It was found in Wanquan County, Jinan, that the farmers' production plans in villages such as Xiafan were forced by the village cadres. Because they were "afraid of not completing the task," the cadres of these villages held a villagers' meeting and asked the farmers to "voluntarily report" their plans on the spot. The village cadres then reported these reluctantly put-together plans to the higher levels. In other areas, plans are made household by household through evaluation. Regarding the implementation of the plan, it was found in Fangshan County that Xiasi Village made a plan to burn charcoal, but now not even half a kilogram of charcoal has been burned. After the village cadres made an appeal to the mass meeting regarding winter production in villages such as Mamaozhuang in Lishi County, it has been completely spontaneous without organization or leadership. Therefore, the Third Administrative Office of the Jin-Sui Border Region (which governs Lishi, Lin County, Zhongyang, Fangshan and other counties) specifically instructed the governments at all levels under its jurisdiction to attach importance to this year's winter production, because it is the preparation and key to "one inch of production growth" next year. It also instructed each county and district to send special personnel to the countryside to inspect the winter production situation, correct shortcomings, and help village cadres and farmers solve specific difficulties in production.

### 晋绥个别地区　冬季生产自流

　　晋绥个别地区
    冬季生产自流
    【新华社兴县十五日电】晋绥解放区个别地区发现冬季生产计划不切实际或不能贯彻执行的现象。离石县某区根据全区八千人口中“妇女占一半”的情况而订出的全区纺织计划，在执行中已证明无法实现。晋南万泉县发现下樊等村农民的生产计划是村干部强迫订的。因为“怕完不成任务”，这些村的干部特召开村民大会，当场要农民们“自报”计划。村干部便将这样勉强凑起来的计划向上级报告。另外有些地区则是用评议方式按户订计划。在执行计划方面，方山县发现下昔村订了烧木炭计划，现在却一斤木炭也没有烧出。离石县马茂庄等村的冬季生产，在村干部向群众大会作了号召之后，就完全是无组织无领导地自流着。因此，晋绥边区第三专署（辖离石、临县、中阳、方山等县）特指示所属各级政府要重视今年的冬季生产，因为它是明年“生产长一寸”的准备和关键。并责成各县各区派专人下乡检查冬季生产情况，纠正缺点，帮助村干部和农民解决生产中的具体困难。
