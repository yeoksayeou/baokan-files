　　【Taihang News】In order to find a way out for the masses in transportation, the Xiangyuan County Cooperative has established two coal stations in ＠ting Town and Gelaowan, Wu乡, organizing 1,500 large carts to participate in transportation. In winter, most of the folk large carts in the county, except for some carts along the main roads that can transport some goods and sell some grain, cannot find work in most villages and have nothing to pull, feeling that there is no way to transport. In order to solve the transportation difficulties of the masses, the cooperative immediately consulted with coal factories such as General ＠, Shangfeng, and Donggou and decided to set up a coal station each in ＠ting and Gelaowan to organize the masses to transport coal. The transportation mileage and cartage fees are stipulated as follows: transporting from Shangfeng Coal Factory to ＠ting Coal Station (about 60 li) earns two baskets for every basket transported. Each cart can pull six to seven baskets each time, each basket weighing 65 to 70 jin, earning 16 baskets per trip. Transporting from Donggou Coal Factory to Wuxiang Gelaowan Coal Station (about 30 li), pulling six baskets earns four baskets, each trip can pull 360 jin, earning 480 jin. More than 20 villages, including Jishan, Bei'e, and Bugou, with more than 1,700 large carts, participated in the coal transportation at these two locations. This not only solved the transportation difficulties of the masses but also helped the coal factories sell their stored coal. In addition to the above two locations, the county cooperative is currently discussing with coal merchants such as Wuyang and X湾, studying the possibility of opening coal stations elsewhere to organize mass transportation.

　　襄垣县联社
    组织大车运煤
    【太行讯】襄垣县联社为了给群众运输找出路，特在＠亭镇及武乡圪老湾设立了两个煤站，组织了一千五百辆大车参加运输。该县民间大车，在冬季运输上除沿大路一部分大车可以运输些货物、贩粜些粮食外，大部村庄找不到脚，无拉的，感到运输无门路。该联社为了解决群众运输困难，即和将军＠、上峰、洞沟等煤厂协商决定，在＠亭和圪老湾各设煤站一处，组织群众运煤。在运输里程和脚价上规定，由上峰煤厂运到＠亭煤站（约六十里）运一筐赚两筐，每次每车能拉六筐到七筐，每筐重量六十五斤到七十斤，运一次能赚十六筐。由洞沟煤厂运到武乡圪老湾煤站（约卅里），拉六筐，赚四筐，每回能拉三百六十斤，可赚四百八十斤。参加这两处运煤的有积善、北娥、卜沟等廿余村，一千七百余辆大车。这样不但解决了群众运输困难，也给煤厂推销了存煤。除以上两处外，现县联社正和五阳、西湾等煤厂商议，研究再到别处开煤站，组织群众运输。
