　　Hui County Sets Off Enlistment Craze
    [Taihang News] Under the great victory of the People's Liberation Army, the people of Hui County are excited and encouraged, and the whole county has set off an enlistment craze. According to statistics from the first, second, third, eighth, and ninth districts, 245 people have voluntarily signed up for the army in one day. In the town of Bobi, under the slogans of "If Chiang Kai-shek is not overthrown, the liberation will not be secure" and "Good men join the People's Liberation Army," 21 people voluntarily enlisted in one day. In the first district, more than 80 people signed up for the army in one day. Many models have emerged in the enlistment. Wang Dasheng, the secretary of the Bobi town branch, and Jia Jingbiao, the director of the Armed Forces Committee, personally led 11 people to enlist collectively; the chairman of the Yijie Congress mobilized his nephew to sign up; and the women's team leader mobilized her son to join the army. Zhang Fuguo from Yang'erjiao, Er district, and Ren Qishan from Shipen also personally sent their sons to join the army. Cui Zuyu and Cui Zhens from Xipingluo, and brothers Cui Ping and Cui Qun all competed to sign up. When Ren Qishan sent his son to join the army, he said, "If the landlord class is not overthrown, liberation will not be secure." Zhang Zhagen's mother said when she sent him to join the army, "Defeat Chiang Kai-shek as soon as possible, so that the whole family can be reunited."
