　　When the Northeast and North China Armies Victoriously Joined Forces
  　Cheers Erupted Under the Walls of Beiping
    Millions of Hearts United to Eliminate the Bandit Fu
    [Jizhong, 25th - From our correspondent, Li Fu]: On the evening of December 13th, the Northeast and North China Armies victoriously joined forces under the walls of Beiping. The two fraternal armies advanced towards Beiping from all directions, with one goal in mind. As the two spearheads met around Beiping, cheers resounded in the brightly lit Fengtai, Nanyuan, and Huangcun, and on the crisscrossing railways. Excited handshakes, enthusiastic salutes. Soldiers of the North China People's Liberation Army shouted: "Hardworking and meritorious Northeast Elder Brothers! We've been looking forward to seeing you!" "We want to learn from you!" "No, we'll learn from you!" Millions of hearts united as one. A communications officer from the "Sichuan Unit" of the Northeast People's Liberation Army delivered a message to the "Africa Unit" of the North China People's Liberation Army. That night, the communications officer from the "Africa Unit" spread his own bedding for him, and after he fell asleep, covered him with his own overcoat, his heart filled with joy and admiration. Cooks from both armies went to the market to buy vegetables, and the cooks from the "Africa Unit" shouted: "Let the Northeast Elder Brothers buy vegetables first!" Stories of the Jinzhou Campaign, the liberation of Shijiazhuang, and the attack on Shenyang... were inquired about and retold. After the North China People's Liberation Army occupied Fengtai, the "Yunnan Unit" of the Northeast People's Liberation Army immediately wrote a list of captured weapons and sent it to the "Africa Unit," saying in the letter: "Here we have anti-tank guns, rocket launchers, mortars, light and heavy machine guns, please come and choose what you need!" They automatically sent 15 various cannons and 120 light and heavy machine guns to the "Pioneer Unit" of the North China People's Liberation Army as a welcoming gift. "Meeting!" Excitement was on every soldier's face. Because "meeting" precisely signifies the demise of the bandit Fu and the liberation of Tianjin and Beiping.

　　东北、华北大军胜利会师时
  　北平城下一片欢呼
    千万颗心拧在一起消灭傅匪
    【冀中廿五日电】前线记者力夫报导：东北、华北两支大军于十二月十三日晚上在北平城下胜利会师。两兄弟部队从四面八方，向一个目标——北平激进。当两支矛头绕着北平相遇时，在灯火辉煌的丰台、南苑、黄村，在交错的铁路上，响起一片欢呼声。兴奋的握手，热情的敬礼。华北解放军的战士们高呼着：“劳苦功高的东北老大哥！早想你们啦！”“我们要向你们学习！”“不，我们向你们学习！”千万颗心拧在一起，东北解放军“四川部”通讯员到华北解放军“非洲部”送信，晚上“非洲部”的通讯员把自己的被子给他铺炕，等他睡着了，又把自己的大衣给他盖上，心里充满着喜悦、羡慕，两军的炊事员到街上买菜，“非洲部”炊事员们喊着：“先尽着东北老大哥们买菜！”锦州会战，石门解放，攻打沈阳……的故事被探询着，重述着。华北解放军占领丰台后东北解放军“云南部”立即写了个缴获武器的清单，送到“非洲部”，信上说：“这里有战防炮、火箭炮、迫击炮、轻重机枪，请你们来选用吧！”自动送给华北解放军“前卫部”各种炮十五门，轻重机枪一百二十挺，作为相见之礼。“相见！”每个战士脸上露着兴奋。因为“相见”正是标示着傅匪的死灭，平津的解放。
