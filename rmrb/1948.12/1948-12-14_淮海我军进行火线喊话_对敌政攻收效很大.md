Xinhua News Agency, Huaihai Front, 11th -- The political offensive conducted by the East China People's Liberation Army against the enemy at the front lines during the first stage of the Huaihai Campaign has yielded significant results. While pursuing and annihilating fleeing enemies along the Longhai Railway, our army used political offensives to persuade thousands of enemies to surrender. During the battle to annihilate the enemy's 63rd Army at Yaowan, frontline appeals became a mass movement. Cai Shangquan, a platoon deputy of a certain regiment, upon discovering that the enemy compressed to the Yunhe River was in a state of panic, shouted, "Kuomintang officers and soldiers will be treated leniently upon surrendering their weapons! Listen to the command!" The desperate enemy immediately blew the assembly horn upon hearing this, formed ranks, and orderly placed their weapons on the ground. After a certain unit's company surrounded the enemy in the southeast corner of Yaowan, they immediately began shouting appeals. Two enemy soldiers' representatives immediately came out to surrender, and then the surrounded enemy all surrendered their weapons. In the battle to annihilate the enemy's 44th Army at Qianhou Huangtan, Chen Ashui, a platoon deputy, and squad leader Yi Xuesheng of the Fourth Company of a certain People's Liberation Army unit, led more than ten soldiers to a position 40 to 50 meters from the enemy. Squad leader Yi Xuesheng first shouted, "The People's Liberation Army treats prisoners leniently. You are surrounded on all sides by us, and our artillery fire is so fierce. It is not worth it to die for Chiang Kai-shek." Chen Jingzhi and others, newly liberated soldiers of the 44th Army, shouted, "I am from the 48th Regiment Reconnaissance Company of the 44th Army. The People's Liberation Army treats me very well, come over quickly!" After shouting for a while, the enemy's gunfire stopped, and a platoon leader was sent to surrender. Platoon deputy Chen Ashui then led five soldiers to the enemy's fortifications and announced to the more than 300 enemies who had lined up to surrender that their lives and property would be guaranteed. In the battle to annihilate the enemy southeast of Xuzhou at Wangtang, Wang Guiqing, a newly liberated soldier, stepped forward to shout appeals when the enemy wavered, explaining the People's Liberation Army's policy of not killing prisoners. He lifted the Kuomintang military uniform he was wearing and said, "I am a soldier of the 107th Army who was just captured by the People's Liberation Army, and I haven't had time to change my clothes yet. The People's Liberation Army does not kill prisoners, and guarantees that private property will not be touched." Following this, nearly a hundred enemies ceased resistance.

    淮海我军进行火线喊话
    对敌政攻收效很大
    【新华社淮海前线十一日电】华东解放军在淮海战役第一阶段中，所进行的火线对敌政治攻势，收效很大。我军在沿陇海路追歼逃敌时，以政治攻势争取数千敌人投降。在窑湾歼灭敌六十三军战斗中，火线喊话形成群众性运动。某团排副蔡尚权发现被压缩到运河边上的敌人慌乱一团时，他就高喊：“国民党官兵缴枪都优待，听口令。”绝望的敌人闻声立即吹起集合号，站起队伍，有秩序地将武器置放在地上。某部一个连包围窑湾东南角的敌人后，即进行喊话。两个敌军士兵代表马上出来请降，接着被围的敌人就全部缴了械。在前后黄滩歼灭敌四十四军战斗中，解放军某部四连一排副陈阿水及班长伊学生率领十余个战士冲到离敌四五十米处后，班长伊学生首先高喊：“解放军优待俘虏。你们四面八方都被我们包围了，我们的炮火这样猛，你们替蒋介石卖命打死了太不值得。”刚被解放的四十四军士兵陈景治等喊话说：“我是四十四军四十八团搜索连的，解放军待我很好，你们快过来吧。”喊了一阵之后，敌人枪声停了，派出一个排长来求降。排副陈阿水便带领五个战士走到敌人工事前，对已站好队投降的三百余敌人宣布保证他们生命财物的安全。在徐州东南王塘歼灭战中，新解放战士王贵卿当敌人动摇时即上前去喊话，解释解放军不杀俘虏的政策，他并掀起穿在身上的国民党军军装，说：“我是刚被解放军俘掳的一零七军士兵，我的衣服还没有来得及换哩。解放军对俘虏不杀，私人的东西也保证不动。”接着，近百的敌人便停止了抵抗。
