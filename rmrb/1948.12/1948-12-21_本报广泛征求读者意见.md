A Respectful Request from This Newspaper to Widely Solicit Readers' Opinions:

　　Since its publication, this newspaper has been nurtured and cared for by all sectors, and has now taken initial shape. In order to further improve our work and meet the requirements of the vast readership, we are taking the opportunity at the end of 1948 to widely solicit opinions from Party, government, military, and civilian organizations, groups, fellow tradespeople, and the broad readership, in order to improve our work. We hope to launch a heated discussion in the newspaper about cherishing and improving the Party newspaper. The questions are now listed below for reference:

　　First, what are your opinions on the four pages of the newspaper? What do you like to read most? What do you dislike reading?

　　Second, what are your opinions on current affairs news and local news? Which are you most interested in, and which are you least interested in?

　　Third, which reporters' dispatches or news reports do you think are well-written, and which are not? Why?

　　Fourth, do you know of any news dispatches that have played a concrete guiding role in actual work, and which have played a bad role or even made mistakes?

　　Fifth, what are your opinions on "Editor-Reader Interactions," "Voices of the Masses," and "Criticisms and Suggestions"? Have these issues played any role? What are your opinions on the newspaper's handling of these issues? Is this format good? How should it be improved in the future?

　　Sixth, what do you think the fourth page should publish more of? What are your opinions on the already published literary works, dispatches, study discussions, experiences, insights, and notes? What else do you want to see published?

　　Seventh, what are your opinions on the layout, printing, and distribution of the newspaper? Do you receive the newspaper regularly, and how fast is the delivery? Can you provide some good methods?

　　Eighth, what are your opinions on the Communications Liaison Section? How is your connection with each other? Does the newspaper have a bureaucratic style?

　　Ninth, in addition to the above questions, what other areas do you feel the newspaper needs to improve?
