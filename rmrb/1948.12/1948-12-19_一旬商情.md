A Ten-Day Market Report
November 24th to December 5th · Market Information Section of the North China Trading Company

In the past ten days, price fluctuations of various commodities within the North China region were more pronounced along the Shijiazhuang-Dezhou railway line, while other areas experienced a steady rise. The commodities with the most significant fluctuations were food grains, followed by oil and cotton. The details are reported below:

Food Grains: Continuing the trend from the previous ten-day period, the rising grain prices in Jinzhong prevented eastward flow, causing anxiety in areas around Yangquan. Furthermore, the convenient transportation and concentrated population along the Shijiazhuang-Dezhou railway line allowed speculative merchants to seize the opportunity to engage in large-scale activities and grab grain everywhere. This affected grain price fluctuations in eastern areas such as Shijiazhuang and Xinji. For example, in Yangquan, from November 24th to December 6th, millet rose by 10%, corn rose by 25.4%, and mixed beans rose by 14.9%. In Shijiazhuang, millet rose by 15.7%, wheat rose by 16.7%, corn rose by 20.05%, and red sorghum rose by 14%. Mixed beans, due to limited sales, fell by 1.4%. In Xinji, millet rose by 2.6%, wheat rose by 12.1%, corn rose by 13.3%, and mixed beans rose by 1.1%. Qu Yang in the North Yue region was also affected by the price increases in the south, with wheat and corn rising slightly. However, in northern Hunyuan, wheat continued its downward trend from the previous ten-day period. Next was Puyang, where millet rose by 13.5%. Looking at other regions and other grain types, apart from mixed beans in Changzhi, Yicheng and red sorghum in Dezhou rising relatively more, the general trend was one of steady increase.

Cloth and Cotton: This ten-day period saw an end to the rising trend of homespun cloth since autumn, turning towards stability, with most areas even experiencing price declines. For example, Xinji fell by 8.1%, Handan fell by 3.1%, and Linqing fell by 0.8%. Only individual areas such as Shijiazhuang, Yuci, and Fengtai saw slight increases due to the influence of grain prices. Cotton prices across the region rose by an average of 4.3%. The largest increase was in Hunyuan in the north, due to large quantities flowing north to exchange for grain, and in Yicheng in the south, due to large-scale purchases by eastern merchants. Yangquan was affected by the fluctuations in food grains.

Oil and Salt: Recently, vegetable oil has been active due to smooth sales. Apart from slight drops in Xinji and Handan, and stability in Puyang and Weifang, most areas saw increases. Bozhen saw the largest increase, at 14.5%. This was followed by Changzhi, Jinan, Shijiazhuang, and Yuci, all rising by about 10%. The overall average increase across the region was 6.58%. Continuing the trend from the previous ten-day period, Puyang and Linfen saw continued increases in salt prices, rising by about 10% this ten-day period. However, northern Hunyuan saw a sharp drop of 16.6%. Other areas remained stable.

Daily Necessities and Coal: This ten-day period saw an increase in white sugar, such as in Shijiazhuang, where it rose by 9.7%, and in Hengshui, where it rose by 8.5%. Paper products showed a semi-stable increase. Matches in Dezhou fell sharply by 18%, while in Shijiazhuang they rose by 4.4%. Soda ash prices fell across the board due to smooth supply from Laiyuan. Coal prices were stable in production areas such as Yangquan, but rose in consumer markets such as Shijiazhuang, where large coal rose by 12.5%, Handan, where it rose by 9.4%, and Linqing, where it also rose by 5.9%.

　　一旬商情
    十一月二十四至十二月五日·华北贸易总公司商情科
    一旬来，华北区内各种商品，石德沿线波动较大，其他地区则是平稳上升。波动商品，以食粮带头，油棉次之。兹分别报导于下：
    食粮：继上旬情况，由于晋中粮价上提，不能东流，以致阳泉一带首感恐惶，更由于石德沿线交通便利，人口集中，致使投机商人，乘机大肆活动，到处抓粮，因此影响东线如石庄、辛集等地粮价波动。如阳泉十一月二十四日至十二月六日，小米升百分之十，玉米升百分之二十五点四，合豆升百分之十四点九。石家庄小米升百分之十五点七，小麦升百分之十六点七，玉米升百分之二十点零五，红粮升百分之十四，合豆由于销路不广，则下落百分之一点四。辛集小米升百分之二点六，小麦升百分之十二点一，玉米升百分之十三点三，合豆升百分之一点一。北岳区的曲阳亦受南线涨价影响，小麦玉米稍微上提。但北部浑源，小麦则继上旬情况而下落，其次即为濮阳小米升百分之十三点五。再从其他地区，其他粮种来看，除长治翼城等地合豆，和德州红粮上升较多一些外，一般都为平稳上升的趋势。
    布棉：本旬情况，停止了过秋以来土布上升的趋势，转向平稳，并且大部地区均形下落。如辛集落百分之八点一，邯郸落百分之三点一，临清落百分之零点八。只个别地区如石家庄，榆次、丰台等地，因受粮价影响而稍形上挺。棉价全区平均上升百分之四点三。其中上升最多的地方，北有浑源，因大量北流换粮而涨。南有翼城，因被东贩大量收购而升。阳泉则系受粮食波动之影响。
    油盐：近来生油因销路顺畅，呈现活跃，除辛集邯郸稍落，濮阳、潍坊平稳外，大部地区，均呈上升。尤以泊镇上升最多，为百分之十四点五。次为长治、济南、石庄、榆次等地，均上升百分之十左右。全区总的平均上升百分之六点五八。食盐继上旬情况，濮阳临汾仍在上升，本旬升百分之十左右。而北部浑源则猛落百分之十六点六。其他地区则为平稳状态。
    日用品、煤炭：本旬白糖上涨，如石家庄升百分之九点七，衡水升百分之八点五，纸类则显半稳上升。德州火柴猛落百分之十八，石家庄则上升百分之四点四，硷面因来沅顺畅都呈下落。煤炭价格产区如阳泉等地价格平稳，消费市场如石家庄大煤上升百分之十二点五，邯郸升百分之九点四，临清亦升百分之五点九。
