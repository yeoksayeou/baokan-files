　　Breeding Livestock to Solve Rural Draft Animal Difficulties
　　——Survey of Draft Animals in 22 Villages in Changzhi by the Huabei University Agricultural College

　　Editor's Note: Breeding livestock and solving the problem of draft animal power is an extremely important issue in developing agricultural production. The article on the survey of draft animals by the Huabei University Agricultural College provides a lot of practical materials and opinions, which are worth studying by everyone.

　　To understand the situation of draft animal shortage in this area and to study how to solve this problem, the Agricultural College of North China University spent a week from October 27th to November 2nd conducting a preliminary survey in Zhou Nan in the third district of Changzhi and Su Dian, Nandong, East and West Jia and other 22 villages in the second district.

　　Draft Animal Shortage Situation
　　1. Comparison of draft animal increase and decrease: According to the survey of 22 villages, the situation is explained in three periods: pre-war, pre-liberation, and present. Before the war, there were a total of 1,839 head of livestock in the 22 villages. During the Japanese occupation, 1,368 head were lost or sold, leaving only 471 head, a loss of about 79 percent. Now, the number has increased to 1,454 head, more than double the number before liberation.
　　2. Comparison of draft animals and cultivated land area: At present, there are a total of 1,454 head of draft animals in 22 villages, with 79,438 mu of cultivated land. Each draft animal bears an average burden of 56 mu of cultivated land. If each draft animal is responsible for planting 30 mu of land, there is still a shortage of slightly less than one-half. It is understood that the physical condition of draft animals in general rural areas is very poor. This includes young animals. For example, Hu Shi, the logistics director of Nandong, only counted 17 draft animals out of 96 in the whole village that could not work, including a disabled mule, two disabled donkeys, and an old horse with bad waist and legs. The rest are 13 young animals. From this, it can be inferred that the actual shortage of draft animals in these villages is more than one-half. Among them, the lack of draft animals is more serious in Zhou Nan, Cao Jia Yan, and Nan Zhuang villages. For example, the cultivated land area of Zhou Nan village is 2,641 mu, with a total of 24 draft animals, each bearing an average burden of 110 mu of cultivated land. In Nan Zhuang, each draft animal must bear 98 mu, and in Cao Jia Yan, each must bear 79 mu.

　　Main Reasons for Draft Animal Shortage
　　1. Lack of breeding male animals: There is only one male donkey in Xiao Xuan Village, He Tou, among the more than 2,000 draft animals in the second district of Changzhi. There are only six breeding male animals among the more than 10,000 draft animals in the whole county. If one-third of the female animals can reproduce, there are about 3,000 female animals. If one male animal is needed for every 100 female animals, then more than 30 breeding male animals are required.
　　Due to the lack of breeding male animals, the following phenomena have appeared:
　　A. Promiscuous mating: Ordinary male animals mate up to three times a day, and should be given appropriate rest, otherwise it will affect the health of the male animals and the conception rate. However, according to the survey, in Hu Guan, a donkey once mated 18-20 times a day at most, and usually 7-10 times. Each time they go to a mating fair, a donkey or horse can mate 20-30 times. In one breeding season this year, a stallion mated 160 times, and a male donkey mated more than 570 times.
　　B. High rewards: Due to the lack of breeding male animals, people who raise male animals demand higher rewards. According to the reflection of Li Qiming and other farmers in Su Dian: "The price of mating with a donkey is high. Three dou of grain must be paid for breeding, and another three dou must be paid after the foal is born."
　　C. It is inconvenient to mate female animals because there are no breeding male animals nearby. As Li Qiming of Su Dian said: "To breed, you have to go to Hao Jia Zhuang, which is fifteen li away. It takes a day to go there and you may not be able to breed." According to the survey, Feng Po and Nan He, which are 60 li away, also go to Xiao Xuan Village to breed. Among the 33 cattle in Shangcun Village, Bafu Tomb, seven are fertile cows, but because there are no male animals nearby and they are afraid of delaying production, none of them have been mated and conceived.
　　2. In addition to the lack of breeding male animals mentioned above, the more serious problem is that the folks are afraid of delaying production or afraid that supporting the young animals will be too heavy a burden, so they simply do not breed. For example, Niu Sidan of Qin Jia Zhuang said: "If a foal is born, production will be delayed for four months." Jin Erpang of Zhaizi said: "There are nine female donkeys in our village this year, and none of them have been mated, because they are all afraid of delaying production." Mutual aid groups feeding livestock together also hinders breeding. Li Chunyuan of Nan Dong said: "Eight families feed a grass donkey together. It was mated once the year before last but did not conceive. It has not been mated last year or this year, because whoever is assigned to use it will seize the time to use it, and even if it is conceived, it will not survive." Wang Chengbao also said: "The mutual aid group feeds livestock for half a year, and the livestock will be worn out. How can they say they will have foals?"

　　How to solve the problem of livestock shortage?
　　Based on this preliminary understanding, the following suggestions are provided regarding solving the rural draft animal problem:
　　1. Regarding draft animal breeding:
　　1. Solving the problem of lack of breeding male animals: A. Purchasing adult male animals can have immediate results, but there are very few adult male animals that can be used for breeding, and attention should be paid to this when purchasing. B. Cultivating breeding animals: According to general surveys, uncastrated male animals that are considered suitable for breeding should be given a certain price first, so that the original livestock owners can raise them to three or four years old, and then purchase them to be used as breeding animals. This method is the most suitable. C. Mobilize people who used to raise male donkeys, provide them with loans, and give them rewards so that they can be employed and provide them with education to improve their skills.
　　2. Regarding female animals, in addition to promoting and encouraging breeding, we should purchase female animals with better physical condition according to the requirements of the general public. For example, Changzhi area used to be a mule-producing area. According to the statistics of 22 villages, horses accounted for more than 20 percent of the total number of livestock before the war, but now it is less than 9 percent. According to the reflection of each village, they all like to raise mares, mainly because breeding mules is very profitable. Under this circumstance, we should try to meet this requirement.

　　2. Purchase draft animals from other areas and support livestock sideline occupations:
　　According to the actual situation of draft animal shortage in each area, issue loans, organize farmers to purchase draft animals from other areas, and support the development of livestock sideline occupations, and try to make most farmers raise draft animals separately. Providing loans to support livestock sideline measures will surely increase the number of draft animals quickly. For example, according to the statistics of Song Jia Zhuang, Nan Huang, and other five villages, because they have loans to engage in sideline transportation, the number of draft animals has increased by 59 percent compared with before the war. In addition, attention must be paid to protecting existing draft animals, focusing on the prevention of infectious diseases, and strengthening the treatment of common diseases.

　　繁殖牲口解决农村畜力困难
    ——华大农学院在长治二十二个村的耕畜调查情况
    编者按：繁殖牲口、解决畜力，为发展农业生产中一个极其重要问题。华大农学院耕畜调查一文提供了不少实际材料和意见，值得大家研究。
    华北大学农学院为了了解本区耕畜缺乏情况，以及研究如何解决这一问题，特于十月二十七日到十一月二日共费时间一周，在长治三区的周南及二区的苏店、南董、东西贾等二十二个村，进行了初步调查。
　　耕畜缺乏情况
    １、耕畜增减情况的比较：根据二十二个村中的调查，分战前、解放前及现在三个时期来说明：在战前，二十二个村中牲畜总计一千八百三十九头，在日寇占领时期，连损失带卖减去一千三百六十八头，仅剩下四百七十一头，损失约百分之七十九，现在则繁殖到一千四百五十四头，较解放以前增加了两倍。
    ２、耕畜与耕地面积的比较：现在二十二个村中共计耕畜一千四百五十四头，耕地七万九千四百三十八亩，每头耕畜负担耕地平均五十六亩。若以每头耕畜种三十亩地计，尚缺乏二分之一弱。据了解，现在一般农村中耕畜体质甚坏，其中尚包括有幼畜，如南董后勤主任胡师只统计全村九十六个耕畜中，有十七个不能劳动，即一个残废骡、两个残废驴、和一个腰腿坏了的老马，其余是十三个幼畜。由此更可推测这些村耕畜实际缺乏在二分之一以上。其中以周南、曹家堰、南庄三村，耕畜缺乏情况比较严重，如周南全村耕地面积二千六百四十一亩，共耕畜二十四头，每头平均负担耕地一百一十亩，南庄每头须负担九十八亩，曹家堰每头须负担七十九亩。
　　耕畜缺乏主要原因
    １、种公畜缺乏：长治第二区总共二千多头耕畜中，仅仅河头小玄村有一个公驴。全县一万多头耕畜中，只有种公畜六头。能繁殖的母畜若以三分之一计，约有三千多母畜，若按一百个母畜需一个公畜，则须三十几个种公畜。
    由于种公畜的缺乏，便出现了下面的几种现象：
    甲、滥交：普通公畜一天交配到三个，尚须给予适当的休息，否则便会影响到公畜的健康及受胎率。但据调查，在壶关一头驴最多一天曾交配到十八——二十头，普通七——十个。每赶一次会，一驴一马便可交配到二十——三十个。在今年一个繁殖季节，公马配了一百六十个，公驴配到五百七十个以上。
    乙、报酬高：由于种公畜的缺乏，养公畜的人，便要较高的报酬。根据苏店农民李起明等的反映：“配驴价钱高，种上了须交三斗粮食，生小驹后还得再交三斗”。
    丙、附近没有种公畜，母畜交配不便。如苏店李起明说：“配种须到郝家庄，十五里，去一次耽误一天的时间还配不住”。又据调查，远在六十里以外的冯坡、南河，还到小玄村去配种。八府坟上村三十三个牛中，有七个能繁殖的母牛，但因附近没有公畜和怕耽误生产，都没有交配受胎。
    ２、除上面说的种公畜等缺乏外，比较严重的便是老乡们因为怕耽搁生产，或怕支差负担幼畜太重，就根本不配种。如秦家庄牛四旦等说：“下个小驹，四个月不能生产”。寨子靳二胖说：“今年我们村一共九个母驴，都没有配，都怕耽搁生产”。而互助组伙喂牲口，也妨碍了繁殖。南董李春元说：“八家合喂一草驴，前年交配一次没有受胎，去年今年就都没有交配，因轮着使，轮到谁家，谁便抓紧使用，就是受了胎也不会存住”。又王成保说：“互助组轮喂半年，牲口就用坏了，还说下驴驹？”
　　如何解决牲口缺乏问题？
    根据这次初步的了解，关于解决农村耕畜问题方面，提供下面的几点意见：
    一、进行耕畜的繁殖方面：
    １、解决种公畜缺乏问题：甲、购买成年公畜，可以立刻见效，但成年公畜中能以作繁殖用的为数很少，购买时应注意。乙、培养种畜：据普通调查，未行阉割的公畜，看其可作种用的，先给予一定价钱，使原来畜主养至三四岁，然后购买过来以作种畜，此法最为适宜。丙、发动过去养驴公的人，给予贷款，予以奖励，使其能以就业，并给以教育，提高其技术。
    ２、关于母畜方面，除宣传鼓励繁殖外，应按照一般群众之要求，购进体质较优的母畜。如长治一带过去为产骡区，据廿二个村的统计，战前马占总畜数的百分之二十以上，现在尚不到百分之九。据各村反映都喜养母马，主要生骡利大，在这种情况之下，就应该设法满足这种要求。
    二、从外区购进耕畜并扶植畜力副业：
    按照各区耕畜缺乏之实际情况，发放贷款，组织农民从外区购进耕畜，并扶植畜力副业的发展，尽量使大多数农民单独饲养耕畜。并扶植畜力副业措施放贷款，耕畜定会很快增加。如据宋家庄、南黄等五个村的统计，因为有贷款能搞副业运输的关系，现在耕畜较战前增加百分之五十九。另外还须注意保护现有耕畜，着重传染病之预防，须加强普通疾病之治疗。
