　　Over 30,000 Carts Speed Up Transportation
  　Hebei Central People Supply the Front Day and Night
    [Hebei Central Dispatch] To support the liberation of Tianjin and Beijing, and to liberate all of North China, the people of Hebei Central are actively transporting grain, oil, salt, vegetables, and firewood to the front lines to ensure supply. According to extremely incomplete statistics from the eighth, ninth, and thirteenth districts, more than 35,000 carts are speeding up transportation. Currently, a total of 14 million jin of public grain has been transported to the front. The masses enthusiastically accept this great transportation task, actively preparing their carts for departure. In the ninth district, carts in each county are organized into squads, teams, platoons, and companies. To reduce illness in people and animals, each county brings along human doctors and veterinarians. For long marches, carts carry knives, mats, iron shovels, and sacks. To prevent the wastage of grain, they also carry needles and thread, ready to mend sacks that are torn at any time. Some carry cart axle carpentry tools, preparing to immediately replace broken axles and continue forward.
    When the order to mobilize carts reached the villages of Wenxin, it was already night. People busily put on their clothes, pulled out livestock, and harnessed them to carts to haul grain. At midnight, all 450 carts in the county set off, delivering 465,000 jin of public grain to a certain location in three days. In Wuqiang, in the course of one night, the entire county mobilized 1,252 carts, loaded 997,000 jin of public grain, and set off towards the front 400 li away.
    This great supply transportation movement is proceeding in a very organized and orderly manner. To facilitate transportation in the southern counties of Hebei Central, several transportation stations have been established in Renqiu. Cart wheels on many major roads stretch for dozens of li, advancing side by side. For easy identification of organization, small flags are displayed during the day, and red and green lights are lit at night. Road signs are set up at intersections during the day. At night, red lanterns are hung high in villages along the way. At bridges and important intersections, special personnel hang lanterns to guide the way and direct the carts to advance. To facilitate traffic without hindering production, two major roads are set up, one for loaded vehicles heading north and another for empty vehicles returning south. The atmosphere is tense, but the order is not chaotic. Carts surge towards the front lines day and night. Carters crack their whips, laughing and saying: "Deliver it quickly, let the army eat it quickly; with strong men and fat horses, we will take Tianjin!"

　　三万余辆大车加速转运
  　冀中人民昼夜供应前线
    【冀中电】为支援解放平津，解放全华北，冀中人民积极向前方运输粮食、油盐、蔬菜、柴草保证供给。按八、九、十三个分区极不完全的统计，有三万五千余辆大车加速地运输着。现在运到前方的公粮共有一千四百万斤。群众都兴奋的接受这一伟大的运输任务，积极准备出车。九分区各县大车编为班、小队、中队、大队。为减少人畜疾病，各县都带着人医兽医，为了长期行军，车上都带着刀、席子、铁锨、口袋等，为防止粮食糟蹋，并带针线，准备口袋破了随时缝补，有的带着车轴木匠工具，防备车轴断了，马上换新车轴继续前进。
    动员大车的命令到达文新各村时，已是夜间了，人们忙着穿上衣裳，拉出牲口套车拉粮。在半夜的时候，全县四百五十辆大车出发了，四十六万五千斤公粮三天送到某地。武强一个夜间的功夫，全县发动起大车一千二百五十二辆，把九十九万七千斤公粮装起，出发奔向四百里的前方。
    这一伟大的供应运输运动，在非常有组织有秩序的进行着。为了便利冀中南部各县份的运输，任邱建立了几个运输栈。车轮在许多条大道上相连数十里齐头并进。为了容易识别建制，白天标志着小旗，晚上则点起了红绿灯。白天在道口设有指路牌。夜间沿途村庄高悬红灯，在桥头上、重要路口，并有专人挂灯指路，指挥大车前进。为便于行车又不妨害生产，特设来回两条大路，载重车北走一条，空车南回另走一条，情绪紧张，秩序毫不混乱。大车不分昼夜的涌向前线，车夫们打着响鞭说笑着：“快送到，快供军队吃；人壮马肥，拿下天津卫！”
