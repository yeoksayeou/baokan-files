Developing Winter Sideline Production
　　Women in Various Regions Actively Weave

　　[Reported by this newspaper] Since the beginning of winter, with the organization and promotion of party members and cadres, many villages have started winter weaving. Dongyin Village in central Hebei suffered severe flooding this year, and the people's livelihood is very problematic. In order to solve the people's livelihood difficulties, the village branch mobilized party members to take the lead in leading the masses to overcome the famine through production. Under the active promotion of party members, the village organized a total of twenty-one weaving groups with thirty-two looms; twenty-two bowstring groups, each with one bowstring; and many spinning groups. In addition, the cotton ginning factory was restored, and cotton husks were lent to fifty-six households without capital to engage in weaving. At the same time, people without capital and production tools were recruited to work in the factory, earning 1,500 yuan per person per day. The masses have a high enthusiasm for weaving production, and almost every household is engaged in weaving. As a result, most of the people's livelihood difficulties in the village have been solved. In the fifth district of Guantao, southern Hebei, 4,560 women participated in winter sideline production, including 2,256 women participating in weaving. 280 women's weaving groups were organized, weaving 212 bolts of cloth every day. In 40 days, they wove 8,480 bolts of cloth, with a total profit of 31,324,200 yuan. A female party member (wife of Zhang Xincheng) in Dongmalan organized a weaving group of 13 people, with a total profit of 310,000 yuan in 40 days. In order to solve the problem of slow capital turnover for the masses, the Licun Cooperative in Xian County, central Hebei, established a relationship with the East China Store to collect local cloth on behalf of the masses to promote finished products. In addition, the cooperative borrowed 1,200 catties of cotton from the county production promotion agency and re-lent it to households without capital for weaving. Under the leadership of the Licun Cooperative, weaving in some nearby villages has also become active. In other places such as Taihang, Taiyue, Beiyue, and Hebei-Shandong-Henan, many villages are also actively weaving. In the process of developing weaving in various places, in addition to paying attention to solving the problems of weaving capital and promoting finished products, some areas and villages have paid attention to further improving weaving technology. For example, in order to vigorously promote shuttle looms and increase cloth production, Taihang Gaoyi held a training class for more than 200 people. In five days, most of the students learned the speed-up wheel, and everyone was very enthusiastic. However, in organizing women's weaving, some women had some concerns. For example, women in Hanjiao Village in Xiajin, southern Hebei, and Shijiatai Village in Ningnan, believed that women with children did not have time to weave; some relied on each other due to family discord (especially between sisters-in-law); and even a few women were unwilling to weave. Although these phenomena have been overcome in large part through propaganda and education.

　　开展冬季副业生产
  　各地妇女积极纺织
    【本报讯】入冬以来，各地在党员干部组织推动下，不少村庄已开展冬季纺织。冀中东尹村，今年遭受严重水灾，群众生活很成问题。村支部为解决群众生活困难，便动员党员带头领导群众生产渡荒。在党员积极推动下，全村共组织了二十一个织布组，三十二张机子；二十二个风弓组，每组一张风弓；还有不少纺线组。另外又将弹轧工厂恢复了起来，把穰子贷给了五十六户没有本的群众进行纺织；同时又将没本和没生产工具的人吸收到工厂做工，每人每天可得工资一千五百元。群众的纺织生产情绪很高，差不多家家都进行纺织。由此，该村群众生活困难大部得到解决。冀南馆陶五区四千五百六十个妇女参加冬季副业生产，其中参加纺织的就有二千二百五十六人，组织起妇女纺织组二百八十个，每天能织布二百一十二匹，四十天中织布八千四百八十匹，共得利三千一百卅二万四千二百元。东马兰一个女党员（张新成之妻）组织了十三个人的纺织组，四十天内共得利卅一万元。冀中献县李村合作社，为解决群众资本周转慢的困难，和华东商店建立代收土布关系替群众推销成品。此外，合作社还从县生产推进社贷了一千二百斤棉花，转贷给无本户进行纺织。在李村合作社的带动下，附近一些村的纺织也活跃起来。其他如太行、太岳、北岳、冀鲁豫等地，亦有不少村也正积极纺织。各地在开展纺织中，除注意解决纺织资本和推销成品外，部分地区和村庄已注意了进一步提高纺织技术问题。如太行高邑为大力推广拉梭机，增加布产，特召开了二百余人的训练班，在五天中，大部学员都学会了加速轮，大家情绪很高。但在组织妇女纺织中，曾有部分妇女对纺织有所顾虑，如冀南夏津韩桥村、宁南史家台等村妇女，有小孩的认为有孩子没工夫纺织；有的因家庭不和（特别是妯娌们），互相靠；甚而有少数妇女不愿纺织。这些现象，虽然经过宣传教育，大部被克服了。
