Xinhua News Agency, Huaihai Front, 21st: General Liao Yunzhou and all officers and soldiers of the 110th Division sent a respectful telegram to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu after their uprising. The telegram reads:

	Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu:

	The Kuomintang reactionaries are betraying the country and forfeiting its sovereignty, willingly serving as pawns of American imperialism to carry out aggression against China, implement dictatorship, crush democracy, launch a civil war, and massacre the people. Yunzhou and others, with the conscience of Chinese people, cannot bear to continue making meaningless sacrifices for the Kuomintang reactionaries' crimes of harming the country and the people. On November 29th, on the Shuangduiji battlefield, we resolutely raised the banner of righteousness, leading all officers and soldiers of the division to join the People's Liberation Army. The spirit of all officers and soldiers is high. From now on, we vow to serve the people resolutely under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and Commanders Liu, Chen, and Deng, and actively fight to overthrow the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries and liberate all of China. We respectfully send this telegram as a salute and await instructions.

	Originally of the Eighty-Fifth Army, 110th Division Commander Liao Yunzhou and Deputy Division Commander Yang Liuying, along with all officers and soldiers, kowtow on December 1st.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 21st: Chairman Mao of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Commander-in-Chief Zhu of the Chinese People's Liberation Army recently sent a telegram in reply to Generals Liao Yunzhou and Yang Liuying. The telegram reads: Generals Liao Yunzhou and Yang Liuying, and all officers and soldiers of the 110th Division:

	Your telegram of December 1st has been read. We are extremely pleased that you rose up on the Shuangduiji front, broke away from the Huang Wei Corps, and joined the People's Liberation Army. You are troops directly under the Kuomintang, and you can see that we will treat you in the same way as other uprising troops and all People's Liberation Army soldiers, granting you equal treatment. We hope you will unite as one, strive for progress, implement revolutionary political work in the army, improve relations between officers and soldiers and between the army and the people, and work together with the People's Liberation Army to complete the national revolutionary tasks.

		Mao Zedong Zhu De December 21, 1948
