Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, December 22nd: Teletype Agency Sofia News: The Fifth Congress of the Bulgarian Workers' Party (Communist) opened here on the 18th, with over a thousand representatives attending. Among the representatives of fraternal parties participating in the congress were Suslov from the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), General Viannis, member of the Political Bureau of the Greek Communist Party, Yaropolk, one of the founders of the Spanish Communist Party, General Lister of Spain, Jiří Hendrych and František of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, and Meier and Meckel of the German Socialist Unity Party.

One of the leaders of the Bulgarian Workers' Party, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Bulgaria, Kolarov, declared in his opening speech: The main task of the congress is to establish the party's general line for Bulgaria's march towards socialism. He said that the Workers' Party had adhered to the principles of the international working class under conditions of illegality, war, and terror, and had educated several generations of socialist fighters. Tens of thousands of the best party members sacrificed their lives in the struggle. Kolarov said: The Bulgarian Workers' Party, whose membership never reached 40,000, has now grown into a mass party with 500,000 members, leading the Fatherland Front, which includes all the working people of Bulgaria.

Yudin, the representative of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, praised the Bulgarian Workers' Party for its contribution to liberating the Bulgarian people from the shackles of fascism in his speech. Volandai, a member of the Political Bureau of the Greek Communist Party, said in his speech, "We, the Greek people, are the vanguard of the anti-imperialist camp in the Balkans. Our struggle is your struggle. Greece will never become a bridgehead for the United States and Britain in the Balkans."

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, December 22nd: Sofia News: The Bulgarian working class and the broad masses of the people warmly celebrated the opening of the Fifth Congress of the Workers' Party. Workers held special meetings to review the competition movement. Many factories have completed their two-year plans ahead of schedule and have begun to implement their five-year plans, putting forward new guarantees for completing the five-year plans. The Bulgarian Youth League wrote to Dimitrov, reporting that 255,000 young men and women had contributed approximately 6 million days of voluntary labor in this year's massive construction projects, saving the country 700 million leva.

The entire country of Bulgaria is filled with a festive atmosphere. Celebratory parades were held in many places. People in many places warmly welcomed the delegates to the congress to Sofia; Dobrich alone saw more than 5,000 people off. Portraits of Workers' Party leaders and red flags were hung on public buildings in the central areas of Sofia, on small streets, and on many private residences in the suburbs.
