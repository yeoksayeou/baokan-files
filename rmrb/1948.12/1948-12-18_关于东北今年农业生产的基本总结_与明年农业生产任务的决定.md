(Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 11th) The Northeast China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee has recently issued "A Summary of Agricultural Production in Northeast China This Year and a Decision on Agricultural Production Tasks for Next Year," the full text of which is as follows:

(I) Basic Achievements in Agricultural Production This Year

This year's agricultural production in the basic areas of the Northeast Liberated Area was carried out on the basis of equal land distribution, combined with correcting deviations and overcoming natural disasters.

The result of equal land distribution was that the vast majority of farmers obtained land that could basically meet their needs and solved the difficulties of major means of production, thereby greatly increasing their enthusiasm for production. This is the most important material foundation for carrying out agricultural production. However, after equal land distribution, the old relations of production were destroyed, and new relations of production still need to be gradually developed and consolidated in the practice of the masses in order to fully adapt to, guarantee, and continue to promote the development of productive forces. In addition, due to the excessively broad scope of attack in the struggle for equal land distribution, the interests of some middle peasants were infringed upon, creating rifts and antagonisms between poor peasants, hired peasants, and middle peasants in many areas. There was suspicion among the people regarding the right to private property, the prevalence of utopian agricultural socialist ideas in rural areas, and the large-scale dispersion of land, livestock, and farm implements. Coupled with the destruction of the war, the looting and plundering by Chiang Kai-shek's bandits in the border areas, the large-scale mobilization for people's war services, the consumption and waste in land reform, last year's natural disasters, the lack of necessary experience of the masses and cadres in some aspects of the production movement under the new conditions, and some disconnection and poor turnover in social and economic life in the war, all placed significant difficulties on this year's agricultural production. However, due to the fact that all our rural work cadres relied on all the peasants to overcome difficulties, this has enabled this year's agricultural production to achieve the following results:

First, it basically guaranteed that all cultivated land was sown. In the entire Northeast (excluding Jehol-Chahar-Liaoning), this year, 683,483 hectares (1 hectare = 10 mu) of new wasteland were reclaimed, exceeding the original plan by 25.6 percent. 60,000 hectares of paddy fields were constructed, exceeding the original plan by more than double. In addition, sowing was timely, and there was more "chǎn" and more "tàng" (more weeding and more soil cultivation), it is estimated that a yield of 12.16 million tons can be completed. In addition, sideline production was organized to support agriculture and overcome disasters.

Second, the rural production army has been unprecedentedly expanded. Not only the existing labor force in rural areas, but all men, women, old and young, who are able to engage in labor, have poured into the production front with a labor enthusiasm that did not exist in the past; and the vast majority of landlords and hooligans who have been detached from production for a long time have also participated in production. This has changed the face of the countryside. Although under the cruel destruction of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits and the huge war mobilization, our rural production has still achieved a certain development.

Third, in the process of production, new relations of production among the people of all classes in rural areas have been established. The vast majority of farmers have begun to turn their attention to the goal of production and prosperity, and the vast majority of cadres have also gained preliminary experience in organizing mass production. This has laid the foundation for carrying out a large-scale production movement next year.

The achievement of these results is primarily due to the fact that the vast majority of farmers have improved their political awareness and enthusiasm for production through land reform; secondly, due to the correct leadership policy of the Party and the government, which has implemented the "organizing and leading production is the central task that overwhelms everything in rural areas" from top to bottom, and cadres at all levels have worked very hard to lead production. Finally, it is also due to the timely resolution of some difficulties in production for farmers, such as the issuance of loans for agriculture, draft animals, immigration, water conservancy, and special crops.

Having achieved a complete victory in the Northeast Liberation War and completely eliminated the feudal exploitation system in most areas, the people of the Northeast Liberated Area, after a year of efforts in the production movement, have a sufficient foundation to carry out a production movement that is completely free from feudal constraints, in which people of all classes can compete for production and prosperity under conditions of freedom and equality. But we dare not be arrogant. We should unremittingly and effectively utilize this stable environment and conditions to rapidly restore and develop production, in order to more powerfully support the National People's Liberation War and improve the people's livelihood, and rapidly raise the agricultural production of the Northeast to a higher level on the existing level.

(II) Several Issues Concerning the Development of Agricultural Production:

(A) The Direction of Rural Economic Development.

Feudalism has fallen, land has been divided, and the long-term central task of rural areas in the future is to develop production, that is, to develop a new democratic agricultural economy. But what is the direction of development? What path should we take? Many of our cadres are still not clear enough in their thinking. The vast majority of farmers are worried about whether "standing out" is allowed, and they have varying degrees of concerns about the future of their economic development.

Some comrades have shown egalitarianism in the issue of developing the rural economy, and have mistakenly applied the farmers' desire for equality and uniformity in the struggle against feudalism (in fact, it is impossible and should not be the case that the farmers' gains are completely equal and uniform in the anti-feudal struggle) to the development of agricultural production. They do not understand that after equal land distribution, farmers exist as individual small private owners, and they all place their hopes on the development and prosperity of their own economy, which is the driving force for rural economic development at this stage. Only with the development of the agricultural economy and the universal prosperity of farmers' lives can the development of new democratic industry have a strong foundation. Therefore, the farmers' competition for the development of their own economy is necessary and inevitable. Only by allowing this competition can the enthusiasm of the vast majority of farmers for production be mobilized. Mobilizing the enthusiasm of the vast majority of farmers for production is the prerequisite for developing the agricultural economy. Egalitarianism hinders the play of this enthusiasm, and it is an erroneous idea that violates the laws of social development.

Some comrades are afraid that capitalism will be generated in the competition of farmers' economic development. These comrades do not understand that land reform only abolishes feudal private property, but does not abolish capitalist private property, and to some extent, it clears the way for the wide development of capitalism. The emergence of new rich peasants after land reform is inevitable. This is not a terrible phenomenon today, but the inevitable law of social and economic development. In a new democratic country, there is a huge socialist state industrial economy led by the proletariat, which controls the economic lifeline of the country, and there is also an agricultural economy in rural areas that gradually develops from individual economy to cooperatives, and a supply and marketing cooperative system can be organized on a large scale to replace private commerce to ensure the state's economic leadership over the agricultural economy. This guarantees the superiority of the people's economy and the solid foundation for its development. This makes it possible for the new democratic society not to establish the wealth and development of a few people on the poverty of the majority, as in the old capitalist era. In the development of the vast majority of farmers' economy, although it is inevitable and unavoidable that some rich peasant economy will be generated, this rich peasant economy, under today's conditions, also plays a certain role in stabilizing the production mood of middle peasants, in the development of productive forces and in the support of the war.

Some comrades do not have a sufficient understanding of the basic point of view instructed by Chairman Mao that the agricultural economy liberated from the feudal system "will basically remain decentralized and individual for a considerable period of time, but in the future, it can be gradually guided to the direction of cooperative societies." They have neglected both the time limitation of "considerable period of time" and the method of gradual advancement. These comrades do not understand that advocating farmers' cooperation and mutual assistance and developing the individual private economy are not contradictory, and do not understand that the cooperation and mutual assistance we advocate today are based on the individual private economy. The wide development of this private peasant economy "lays the foundation for the task of developing industrial production and transforming the agricultural country into an industrial country." Developing industry on the basis of developed agriculture, first of all, developing the state-owned large industry, is the basic goal of the new democracy and the basic task of us in the entire new democratic revolutionary stage. Neglecting this, and mistakenly believing that relying not on the highly developed state-owned industry, not on a large number of agricultural machines, but only on the current mutual labor assistance, can avoid class differentiation in rural areas, and can quickly move towards the collectivization of socialist agricultural production, is a very harmful fantasy. In the spring of this year, in some places, the "agricultural cooperatives" and "joint farming," "joint housing," "large-scale harvesting" (a method of joint farming, joint distribution, joint eating, and joint use among farmers), and "collective horse feeding," which were divorced from reality and the demands of the masses, are reflections of this erroneous thinking. The basic root of these erroneous ideas is the reflection of utopian agricultural socialist ideas in agricultural production. We must resolutely overcome and eliminate this idea in order to correctly realize the direction of new democratic economic development instructed by Chairman Mao.

But our allowing the development of private capitalism, and acknowledging that cooperation and mutual assistance in agricultural production and the private economy are not contradictory, does not mean that we can regard the development of private capitalism as the direction for us to lead the agricultural economy and the entire national economy, and can abandon the leadership of the proletariat over agricultural production and rural cooperative undertakings, allowing it to advance entirely according to the old capitalist line. No, we are definitely not like this. The direction of rural economic development in the future should be, on the one hand, rewarding farmers for production and prosperity, working hard to get rich, and enabling the vast majority of farmers to rise to become well-fed and well-clothed farmers; and on the other hand, it must make the vast majority of farmers "gradually develop from individual to collective." In the process of developing in the direction of collectivism, not only is it necessary to develop mutual labor assistance in production labor, but also it is necessary to universally and systematically establish supply and marketing cooperatives in the supply of tools, seeds, raw materials, and the transportation and sale of agricultural products, in order to promote the development of farmers' production and enable farmers to be less and even free from the exploitation of merchants. That is to say, when we lead the development of the agricultural economy, on the one hand, we must oppose all kinds of utopian agricultural socialist ideas, and struggle against the confused ideas of being fond of eating and lazy in doing things, being content with poverty, and taking poverty as glory; on the other hand, we must oppose abandoning the leadership of the proletariat over the development of the agricultural economy, advocating complete free competition, and letting it develop freely along the capitalist line. The path of development of the new democratic agricultural economy should be a road that gradually - initially in the supply and marketing and production mutual assistance aspects, and then in the collective production of agricultural products - leads to the direction of cooperative societies.

(B) Policy Issues

In order to develop agricultural production, it is necessary to establish and consolidate the idea of the vast majority of the masses to produce and prosper, and work hard to get rich, in order to mobilize the production enthusiasm of the vast majority of farmers, and to educate and guide thousands of individual farmers to gradually move towards the road of collectivization. This is the starting point of our policy. Regarding policy issues, in addition to organizing production through mutual assistance and cooperation, the main issues include the following four:

1.  Determining and consolidating the private property rights of all classes in rural areas after land reform; 2. A fair, reasonable, and public-private balanced burden policy; 3. Production incentive policy; 4. Production education policy. Now, they are explained separately as follows.

First, regarding the issue of determining and consolidating the private property rights of all classes in rural areas, it must be recognized that the rural economy after land reform is still a decentralized and individual economy, and the result of land reform is only to abolish the feudal private system and replace it with the farmers' private system. Therefore, in all basic areas where land reform has been completed, it is necessary to determine and consolidate this new private system in order to facilitate the development of the economy at this stage. This mainly includes the following points:

A. Acknowledge that all feudal land property that has been distributed belongs to individuals and allow individuals to freely dispose of it. And issue land certificates and house certificates to determine land rights and house rights.

B. Compensate for the land property of middle peasants that has been wrongly distributed. For those that have been compensated (i.e., the middle peasants who were struggled against have been compensated to the standard of general poor and hired peasants after equal distribution), immediately announce that the land rights and property rights will no longer be changed. For those that have not been compensated, call on poor and hired peasants to voluntarily help resolve it reasonably, or the state will resolve it by reducing public grain and other methods. And limit the time to complete it, and never drag it on again.

C. Ensure that the income from one's own labor, hiring people to manage, legitimate interest income, and renting out land under specific conditions is entirely owned by oneself. No one is allowed to infringe upon it.

D. Acknowledge everyone's right to free management, protect freedom of exchange, and encourage the development of production.

E. Implement a voluntary and mutually beneficial production cooperation and mutual assistance policy, oppose forced formation of production teams, and all phenomena that infringe on the private property rights of farmers in cooperation and mutual assistance.

F. Abolish certain property ownership systems in various forms such as farmers' associations or poor peasant groups, and restore the farmers' private property system. All economic fruits of the farmers in the anti-feudal struggle, such as those that have not yet been distributed, may be thoroughly distributed and owned by individuals, except as stipulated by the senior government.

G. The labor income of the original landlords and rich peasant elements after land reform should also be protected. The various properties that they retained undistributed during the land reform period should also be protected as long as they are used for production.

H. Any behavior of landlords, bandits, and hooligans that disrupts rural production order must be severely punished.

The above points are all the steps that must be taken to determine and consolidate the private property rights of all classes in rural areas after land reform. Where this has been done, the production mood of all classes has shifted from turbulence to stability, from passive to active, and the idea of the vast majority of the masses to produce and get rich, and work hard to get rich has been established and developed. Therefore, in places where this has already been done, it is necessary to earnestly check and further enhance the idea of the masses to produce and get rich; in places where it has not been done or not done well, it is necessary to earnestly do it.

Second, regarding the issue of a fair, reasonable, and public-private balanced burden policy.

We should continue to support the National People's Liberation War on the basis of restoring and developing production, without increasing the burden and trying to reduce the people's burden as much as possible, in order to facilitate the restoration and development of production, supporting the war on the one hand, and gradually improving the people's livelihood on the other. This policy should include the following items:

A. Stipulate and unify agricultural tax rates according to the normal annual output of each place, in order to balance the burden and stimulate farmers' production. B. Adjust the burden ratio between urban and rural areas in order to prevent the burden between urban and rural areas from being excessively disparate. C. Reasonably use civilian labor and stipulate wartime service burden regulations that are more suitable for the people in our area. D. Implement a fair and reasonable system of farming on behalf of the families of soldiers and staff who lack labor.

Third, the production incentive policy should include:

A. Rewarding and protecting the breeding of livestock; B. Rewarding intensive cultivation; C. Rewarding the reclamation of wasteland and the construction of water conservancy projects; D. Rewarding labor heroes and model workers; E. Rewarding sideline production and the development of handicraft cooperatives; F. Assisting immigrants; G. Rewarding the production of special crops (especially cotton and hemp in South Manchuria and Jehol), developing industrial raw materials, and rewarding the production of commercial grain; H. Rewarding the development of various technologies that improve mass production.

Fourth, strengthen production education for district and village cadres and the masses. All comrades working in rural areas should learn agricultural production knowledge and cultivate agricultural production cadres and cooperative business cadres.

(C) On the Issue of Organizing Production Cooperation and Mutual Assistance and Supply and Marketing Cooperatives.

After land reform, due to the dispersion of land, livestock, and farm implements and the difficulties of natural disasters, and because the characteristics of agricultural management in the Northeast require a certain number of livestock and tools to cultivate, and because a large number of landlords, vagrants, and some rich peasant elements in rural areas after land reform need to be organized into the production front in an appropriate way, therefore, organizing rural production cooperation and exchange labor has become a very urgent issue.

This year's rural production cooperation and mutual assistance played a great role in ensuring that cultivated land was not barren, that cultivation was timely, that various disasters were overcome, and that the contradiction between war service and production was regulated. However, due to the cadres' impatience in thinking and some problems in their work style, they also took many detours. It must be pointed out that some of these places were influenced by agricultural socialist ideas.

During the spring plowing season, many production organizations with the same essence and different forms, such as the so-called "agricultural cooperatives," "large-scale harvesting," "joint farming," and "collective horse feeding," which were not permitted by current economic conditions, were quickly abolished under the instructions of the Northeast Bureau. However, after correcting this phenomenon, the formalistic production cooperation organizations in the form of forced orders that violated the principles of voluntariness and mutual benefit in many areas are still extremely serious. It should be pointed out that this kind of production organization is useless and harmful to improving the production enthusiasm of the masses. It must be resolutely improved.

The experience of various places in organizing rural production cooperation is:

1.  It is necessary to adhere to the principles of voluntariness and mutual benefit (i.e., equivalent exchange), and production organizations for cooperation and mutual assistance must be based on voluntariness and mutual benefit. This is the fundamental principle of organizing; otherwise, it will definitely fail. In order to thoroughly guarantee the implementation of the principles of voluntariness and mutual benefit, everyone who joins cooperation and mutual assistance must be allowed to withdraw freely at any time.

2.  At present, rural cooperation and mutual assistance production organizations should generally be small-scale, seasonal, and decentralized. It is possible to adopt flexible methods of organizing when there is a need at any time and dissolving when there is no need. On this basis, make possible gradual improvements, but do not force improvements, let alone force consolidation.

3.  Next year, a small number of farmers may have the strength to harness a plow alone, and therefore withdraw from the current production cooperative organization. In order to encourage farmers' interest in buying horses, as long as they can cultivate the land and are willing to operate independently, it is completely possible and should be allowed to do so, and doing so under current conditions is beneficial to stimulating the production enthusiasm of the majority of farmers.

In addition to the above-mentioned mutual assistance organizations in agricultural production, it is also necessary to universally establish supply and marketing cooperatives from top to bottom in rural areas, in order to establish the connection and leadership of the state economy led by the proletariat over the small-scale production economy of farmers, reduce the intermediate exploitation of merchants, supply farmers with various means of production and means of living as cheaply as possible, and fairly purchase and transport and sell farmers' products, in order to improve agricultural productivity and develop various rural sideline occupations. The method should be to first establish the Northeast Supply and Marketing Cooperative Federation and the provincial-level cooperatives of various provinces, and then select several counties and townships as key points to solicit members and conduct business, in order to obtain experience and mass support, and then promote it. The only task of the supply and marketing cooperative is to assist members in production, protect the interests of members, and avoid merchant exploitation. It must supply farmers with relatively cheap tools and commodities, and purchase and transport and sell farmers' surplus grain, raw materials, and sideline products at fair prices, thereby protecting the interests of members; it should not aim to exploit members or non-member masses to make profits and distribute dividends, as ordinary merchants do. The Party and government in rural areas must send a large number of the best cadres to handle the supply and marketing cooperatives, and study hard how to do business, but not to learn how to exploit farmers and small producers like merchants, but to learn how to reduce or even eliminate this exploitation for them, in order to make the cooperative have strong leadership backbone. It is necessary to periodically convene the members' congress and the congress of representatives and representative meetings at all levels of the cooperative, so that the leadership backbone and the masses have frequent and close contact. The state must help the cooperative's funds, and give various preferential treatments to good supply and marketing cooperatives in terms of taxation, transportation, and ordering. Our comrades should understand the great importance of this supply and marketing cooperative undertaking, and should not have the view of attaching importance to agriculture and neglecting commerce. It should be known that within the scope of the small commodity economy, commerce can control agriculture and even destroy agriculture. Without reasonable commerce, small agriculture cannot have reasonable development. Due to the elimination of feudal exploitation, the victory of the Liberation War, the liberation of large cities, and the development of large industry, agricultural products will inevitably be largely commercialized. Therefore, the rural supply and marketing cooperatives under the leadership of the proletariat will inevitably develop into the command organs of rural commodity production in the new democratic society. Because this kind of supply and marketing cooperative is still extremely underdeveloped today, and has not yet aroused serious attention and established a correct understanding in the whole Party, we must give greater attention to this work today. It should be pointed out that doing a good job in rural supply and marketing cooperatives is of the same importance as improving agricultural production technology and developing agricultural production mutual assistance. A well-run supply and marketing cooperative is the hub for organizing rural production and consumption. To improve rural production, it is not enough to rely solely on the Party and government organs to direct it administratively; it is also necessary to establish economic command organs. One of these economic command organs is the rural supply and marketing cooperative. Party and government organs at all levels must pay the greatest attention to establishing supply and marketing cooperatives that can truly represent the interests of the masses. Many cooperatives in the past have been poorly managed, such as using the methods of speculative merchants to exploit the masses, with the sole purpose of making profits and distributing dividends, must be resolutely corrected and banned.

Many cadres working in rural areas feel that they do not have many things to do in developing rural production. Because improving agricultural production technology often requires specialized knowledge, and they often do not have or it is difficult to have this specialized knowledge. Organizing agricultural production mutual assistance can only be done according to the farmers' voluntariness, and our cadres cannot have more things to do other than calling for and assisting from the sidelines; if they want to do more things, and are impatient, they often take the path of forced orders. However, they do not know how to organize supply and marketing cooperatives well, in order to initially organize all the farmers. This is precisely the basic link that our rural work cadres should strive for in improving rural production today.

All state economic organs should support cooperatives, especially the Ministry of Commerce and local trade bureaus should regard supporting the proper development of cooperatives as their basic task. This support, first of all, is to supply the cooperative with farmers' means of production and means of living at a relatively cheap price, and to sell the cooperative's products purchased from farmers.

(D) On the Issue of Improving Agricultural Productivity.

According to the current situation, the main issues in improving agricultural productivity are as follows:

1.  Protecting Livestock and Breeding Livestock. Draft animals occupy an extremely important position in agricultural productivity in the Northeast. However, the mortality rate of livestock has been extremely high in recent years. For example, in Nenjiang, 40,000 out of 400,000 livestock died, which is an extremely serious problem.

The following measures should be taken to reduce livestock mortality:

(1) Whoever the livestock is distributed to owns it, and livestock that has not been distributed should be distributed. Oppose collective ownership and collective horse feeding. In cooperative and mutual assistance production, reasonable horse labor prices should be stipulated so that those who raise horses can profit from it. (2) Depending on the circumstances in various places, mobilize the masses to build cattle and horse sheds. (3) Train veterinary talents and establish livestock protection organizations. The provincial-level should set up livestock epidemic prevention stations to conduct immunization injections. (4) The most important thing is to prepare enough horse grass and horse feed (grain grass, bean pods, live grass, bean cakes, etc.) to prevent draft animals from dying of starvation and disease.

Regarding the breeding of livestock, in addition to selecting good horse breeds and cattle and donkey breeds, breeding stations should be established with the district as the unit to breed livestock in a planned manner, and efforts should be made to purchase livestock from areas with more livestock to areas lacking livestock. Appropriate reductions and exemptions should be given in terms of burdens and taxes for breeding livestock and adding livestock to encourage them.

2.  Preventing Floods and Constructing Water Conservancy Projects. There are many basins in the Northeast, which are prone to flood damage. This year, the area of ​​cultivated land affected by floods in the entire region is approximately 300,000 hectares; the area of ​​good farmland avoiding floods by repairing canals and building dams and digging smooth ditches is 440,313 hectares, which shows how important this issue is. The Northeast Administrative Committee must plan to build several large canals and dikes, and the provinces within their respective provinces must also set out plans for repairing canals and building dikes, and the districts and villages must organize the masses to dig smooth ditches in order to prevent floods and restore and expand paddy fields. It must be understood that water conservancy is of great significance to increasing production, and the natural conditions in the Northeast are extremely conducive to the development of water conservancy. Therefore, wherever conditions permit, the local Party and government should lead the masses to restore and construct paddy fields. Regarding flood prevention and water management and the construction of water conservancy projects, unified plans should be made, water conservancy loans should be issued by the government, and the responsibilities should be divided by levels, mobilize and rely on the masses, conduct them in an organized and planned manner, and make long-term plans, and oppose going their own way.

3.  Improving Farming Methods. Promote fertilization, repairing the land, intensive cultivation, more plowing and more tilling; promote the manufacture and gradual and progressive improvement of agricultural tools. Provinces should focus on agricultural tool factories. Small counties and towns should use blacksmith shops to manufacture simple agricultural tools to meet the needs of farmers; promote seed selection and eliminate insect pests. Agricultural experiment stations should be set up with a focus on improving varieties and trial planting winter wheat. Provinces should hire agricultural specialists to provide scientific guidance, conduct practical research on various improved agricultural techniques, and cultivate agricultural cadres.

4.  Public farms should be given importance by various localities. Because it is currently the representative of agricultural productivity development, and has a great demonstration effect on agricultural production in various places, investment in it should be expanded and its financial tasks should be reduced. Provinces and counties with conditions can run farms. All farms should be managed reasonably, machines should be used in a concentrated manner, and management should be enterprise-oriented, so as to achieve both profitability and help improve local agricultural technology.

5.  Agricultural loans should be used in a concentrated manner for investment in agricultural construction. First of all, means of production should be provided to farmers as much as possible through supply and marketing cooperatives. The past approach of relief and decentralized use should be changed, in order to rely on agricultural loans to truly do a few things related to agricultural construction well. As for the livelihood difficulties of some farmers, they should mainly rely on the adjustment between farmers, the establishment of barns, and low-interest loans from banks to solve them.

(III) Land Reform Work in Semi-Old Areas and New Areas.

In addition to the 70% of the basic areas, there are three types of areas in the entire Northeast:

1.  Semi-Old Areas: In this type of area, land has generally been divided equally, but not thoroughly. Generally, there is no need for a comprehensive equal division, but a larger scope of adjustment can be implemented.

2.  New Areas: In some of these areas, liquidation and land reform have also been carried out, but it has been extremely incomplete. The feudal system still exists, landlords and rich peasants still occupy a large amount of land property, and poor and hired peasants still have a large population and little land. In other areas, land reform has not yet been carried out at all. Land should be equally divided in these two types of areas in the autumn and winter of this year.

3.  Border Areas and Guerrilla Areas: That is, the enemy's armed forces have not been completely eliminated, the environment is still unstable, and the vast majority of the basic masses have not yet requested land division. In this type of area, land reform will not be carried out in the autumn and winter of this year, but only the social policies of rent reduction and interest reduction and fair and reasonable burden policies will be implemented in order to concentrate forces to eliminate all armed forces of the Kuomintang, crack down on the small number of most reactionary despots in politics, and raise the awareness of farmers.

When adjusting land and implementing equal division in semi-old areas and new areas in the autumn and winter of this year, we must accept the lessons of equal land division last year based on the instructions of the Central Committee on land reform work and Party rectification work in 1948, and formulate specific plans after careful consideration. Attention should be paid to the following when implementing it:

A. Distinguish different situations and put forward different requirements. For example, in places where land reform has been implemented in the past, efforts should be made to completely eliminate feudalism and complete the equal division of land before the spring plowing next year; in places where land reform has not been carried out in the past, efforts should be made to complete the division of land before the spring plowing to basically meet the land requirements of the basic masses and solve the difficulties of their main means of production to facilitate the spring plowing next year; land reform should never be forced in places where land reform cannot be carried out this year.

B. Transfer the necessary quantity and quality of cadres, hold cadre meetings well, and earnestly study Chairman Mao's speech at the cadre meeting in Jin-Sui, Comrade Ren Bishi's speech on several issues in land reform, the Central Committee's instructions on land reform work and Party rectification work in old areas and semi-old areas, instructions on land reform work and Party rectification work in 1948, the decision on the two documents in 1933, and the Northeast Bureau's basic summary of the equal land division movement, so that all cadres participating in land reform can fully understand the various policies and class division methods stipulated by the Central Committee and the Northeast Bureau, and implement them in their work without unauthorized modifications. In terms of work steps, we must resolutely oppose impatience, and adopt a wave-like gradual advancement method according to the conditions of different regions, cadres, and masses.

C. In land reform, we must combine Party rectification and Party building, correct the erroneous practices of dismissing all old cadres, "moving stones," and "lifting broken cars" in the equal division movement last year, and establish people's representative meetings at the county, district, and village levels at the same time as land reform.

D. Carrying out land reform and preparing for production is a unified task. Therefore, we must strictly prevent all destructive and wasteful phenomena, so that all fruits of struggle such as land, draft animals, farm implements, grain, and other floating property can be reasonably distributed and truly used to solve the needs and difficulties of the basic masses for production next year, and pay attention to combining the organization of the masses in land reform to carry out winter sideline production.

In short, whether the land reform work in semi-old areas and new areas can be done well this year depends on whether the Central Committee's policies can be correctly implemented and implemented in land reform, and whether all preparations for production next year can be done well. This is also the Northeast Bureau's basic requirement for semi-old areas and new areas to complete land reform before the spring plowing next year.

(IV) Tasks for Next Year.

In the basic areas in the future, the basic task of the rural Party is to lead the people to develop agriculture and sideline production, and on the basis of promoting agriculture and sideline production, to do a good job in rural production cooperation and mutual assistance organizations and supply and marketing cooperatives, in order to more powerfully support the front line and develop the people's economy.

Various localities must make full use of the autumn and winter of this year to fully complete all the preparations for the large-scale production movement next year, so that next year will launch a universal production movement that is completely free from feudal constraints, in which people of all classes can compete for production and prosperity under conditions of freedom and equality.

Except for those urban or factory enterprises where there is only industry and no agriculture, the Party committees should regard the development of industrial production as the only task. Party committees at the provincial level should generally place agricultural and industrial production in an equally important position. Party and government organizations and cadres at all levels below the county level should regard leading agricultural production as their basic task. This is also the basic content of our rural mass work. All local organizations and rural Party work must adapt to this situation and undergo a major transformation. We must mobilize the entire Party, add oil and add strength, and organize and lead the large-scale production movement in the Northeast Liberated Area next year, just as we mobilized 12,000 cadres to go to the countryside.

According to the statistics of cultivated land area, manpower, and animal power in the entire Northeast (excluding Jehol-Chahar-Liaoning) this year, we strive to achieve a total output increase of 15% compared with this year, that is, 1.8 million tons next year.

The basic policy for increasing production should be based on intensive cultivation and improving yield, and supplemented by encouraging wasteland reclamation and expanding cultivated land area. That is, relying on intensive cultivation to complete 70% of the increase in production (an increase of 100 kg per hectare); relying on the construction of paddy fields to complete 10% (constructing 800,000 hectares of paddy fields); and relying on wasteland reclamation to complete 2% (reclaiming 400,000 to 500,000 hectares of wasteland). In addition, the mass sideline production should be developed according to different conditions in various places.

In order to achieve this task:

First, we need planning. The Ministry of Agriculture should cooperate with the Ministry of Commerce and other relevant departments to formulate a 1949 agricultural production plan and rural supply and marketing plan. Various provinces, counties, districts, and villages should also formulate realistic plans that are not sensational and do not pursue empty names based on the overall plan. Regarding agricultural construction, we should consider it from a long-term perspective, not only looking at next year, but also looking at the next two or three years, and looking at the future.

Second, we must adapt to local conditions. The Northeast region is vast, and there are great differences in natural conditions and work history in various places. Various places should analyze the local situation to stipulate local specific tasks and practices.

Third, we must summarize and learn well from the experience of leading rural production this year, promote and improve the good ones, and not repeat the errors.

We must improve the agricultural production of the Northeast Liberated Area in order to more powerfully support the national liberation war and promote the development of industrial production in the Northeast and improve the lives of the people in the Northeast. Although we are still at the most tense moment of the Chinese revolutionary war today, the construction work of the great new democratic country has already begun here. Let us urgently mobilize the entire Party to strive for victory on the agricultural production line.

　　关于东北今年农业生产的基本总结
  　与明年农业生产任务的决定
    【新华社哈尔滨十一日电】东北中共中央局顷发布“关于东北今年农业生产的总结与明年农业生产任务的决定”，全文如下：
    （一）今年农业生产的基本收获
    今年东北解放区基本地区的农业生产，是在平分土地的基础上结合纠正偏向与克服灾荒而进行的。
    平分土地的结果，使广大农民得到了基本上可以满足需要的土地，与解决了主要生产资料的困难，因而生产积极性大增。这是进行农业生产最主要的物质基础。但是经过平分土地之后，旧的生产关系被破坏，新的生产关系还需要在群众实践中逐渐地发展与巩固起来，才能充分适应、保障和继续促进生产力的发展。此外，由于在平分土地的斗争中打击面过宽，侵犯了一部分中农的利益，在不少地区造成了贫雇中农间的裂痕与对立，人民对于财产私有权的怀疑，农村中空想的农业社会主义思想的流行，以及土地、牲畜、农具大量的分散。加以战争的破坏，边沿区蒋匪的抢劫掠夺，人民战争勤务的大量动员，土地改革中的消耗与浪费，去年的自然灾害，群众与干部对于新条件下的生产运动在某些方面缺乏必要的经验以及在战争中社会经济生活的某些脱节与周转不灵等，都予今年的农业生产以重大的困难。但由于我们全体农村工作的干部，依靠了全体农民来克服困难，这样，就使得今年的农业生产获得以下的成绩：
    第一、基本上保证了耕地全部种上。全东北（冀察热辽除外）今年新开荒地六八三、四八三垧（每垧十亩），超过原定计划的百分之二十五点六。兴修水田六万垧，超过原定计划一倍以上。加以耕种及时，多“铲”多“趟”（多锄草多培土），估计可完成产量一千二百十六万吨。此外并组织了副业生产，支持了农业，渡过了灾荒。
    第二、农村的生产大军，空前地扩大了。不仅农村现有的劳动力，所有男女老少，凡能够从事劳动的，都以过去所没有的劳动热情，涌到生产战线上来；而且长期与生产脱离的地主、二流子，绝大多数也参加了生产。这样就改变了农村的面貌。虽然在蒋匪残酷的破坏与庞大的战争动员之下，仍使我们的农村生产获得一定的发展。
    第三、在生产过程中，农村各阶层人民的新的生产关系业已确立了。广大农民开始把自己的注意力转向生产发家的目标，绝大多数干部也获得了组织群众生产的初步经验。这就奠定了明年开展大生产运动的基础。
    这些成绩的获得，首先是由于广大农民经过土地改革，政治觉悟与生产积极性提高，其次是由于党和政府领导方针正确，从上到下地贯彻了“组织与领导生产，是农村压倒一切的中心工作”，各级干部对生产领导十分努力。最后，还由于不失时机地为农民解决了若干生产中的困难，如发放关于农业、耕畜、移民、水利、特种作物的贷款等。
    取得了东北解放战争的完全胜利，并在绝大部分地区彻底消灭了封建剥削制度的东北解放区人民，又经过一年来生产运动的努力，已经有了充分的基础，来开展一个完全没有封建束缚的，各阶层人民得以在自由平等的条件下比赛生产致富的生产运动。但我们决不敢骄傲。我们应该毫不放松地、十分有效地利用这种安定的环境和条件，迅速恢复和发展生产，以便更有力地支援全国人民解放战争与改善人民生活，把东北的农业生产在现有的水平上迅速提高一步。
    （二）关于发展农业生产中的几个问题：
    （甲）农村经济发展的方向问题。
    封建倒了，土地分了，农村今后长期的中心任务，就是发展生产，就是发展新民主主义的农业经济。但发展生产的方向是什么？究竟走一条什么道路？我们有许多干部思想上还不够明确。广大农民则担心着许不许“冒尖”的问题，对自己经济发展的前途，存在着不同程度的顾虑。
    有的同志在发展农村经济的问题上，表现了平均主义的思想，把农民在斗争封建时要求平等划一的思想（实际上即在反封建斗争中也不可能和不应该使农民的所得完全平等划一），错误地引用到发展农业生产中来。不了解在平分土地之后，农民已作为个体的小私有者而存在，他们都把希望寄托在自己经济的发展与繁荣上，这正是现阶段农村经济发展的原动力。也只有农业经济发展，农民生活普遍地富裕起来，才使新民主主义的工业发展有强大的基础。因而农民为发展自己经济的竞赛是需要的，是不可避免的，只有允许这个竞赛，才能发动广大农民的生产积极性。而发动广大农民的生产积极性，则是发展农业经济的前提。平均主义的思想则是妨害这种积极性的发挥，而且他是一种违犯社会发展规律的错误思想。
    有的同志害怕在农民经济发展的竞赛中，产生资本主义。这些同志不了解土地改革只是废除封建的私有财产，并未废除资本主义的私有财产，并在某种范围内还是为资本主义的广大发展扫清道路。土地改革后新富农的产生是不可避免的，这在今天，并不是什么可怕的现象，而是社会经济发展的必然规律。在新民主主义国家里，有着无产阶级领导的、控制全国经济命脉的巨大的社会主义性质的国家工业经济为领导，又有农村中由个体经济逐步向合作社方向发展的农业经济，并可组织广大范围的供销合作社系统去代替私人商业以确保国家经济对于农业经济的领导，这就保证了人民经济的优越性及其发展的坚实基础，这就使得新民主主义社会有可能不照旧资本主义时代那样，把少数人的富裕和发展，建立在多数人的贫困上面。在广大农民经济的发展中，虽然必然地也不可免地要产生一些富农经济，而这种富农经济，在今天的条件下，对于稳定中农的生产情绪，对于生产力的发展与战争的支援，也是有一定的作用的。
    有的同志对于毛主席所指示的由封建制度下解放出来的农业经济，“在一个颇长时间内，基本上仍然是分散的、个体的、但是在将来可以逐步地引向合作社方向发展”的基本观点认识不足，把“颇长时间”的时间规定性，与逐步前进的方法都忽略了。这些同志不了解提倡农民的合作互助与发展个体的私有经济并不矛盾，不了解我们今天所提倡的合作互助，正是以个体的私有经济为基础。这种私有农民经济的广大发展，“就绐发展工业生产、变农业国为工业国的任务，奠定了基础。”而在发展了的农业的基础上发展工业，首先是发展国有化的大工业，乃是新民主主义的基本目的，也是我们在整个新民主主义革命阶段中的基本任务。忽视了这个，错误地认为不依靠高度发展的国有化的工业，不依靠大批农业机器，而仅仅依靠目前的变工互助，就可以避免农村中的阶级分化，就可以很快地走到社会主义的农业生产集体化，这是一种十分有害的空想。今春某些地方，脱离实际，脱离群众要求而提出的“农业合作社”及“合伙种地”、“共伙房”、“大把菁”（农民中一种伙种、伙分、伙吃、伙用的办法）、“集体喂马”等，就是这种错误思想的反映。这些错误思想的基本根源，是空想的农业社会主义思想在农业生产中的反映。必须坚决克服与肃清这种思想，才能正确地实现毛主席所指示的新民主主义经济发展的方向。
    但是我们允许私人资本主义的发展，承认农业生产中的合作互助与私有经济不相矛盾，并不是说，我们可以把发展私人资本主义当作我们领导农业经济和整个国民经济的方向，可以放弃无产阶级对于农业生产和农村合作事业的领导，使之完全按照旧资本主义的路线前进。不是的，我们决不是这样。今后农村经济发展的方向，在一方面，应该是奖励农民生产发家，勤劳致富，使绝大多数农民上升为丰衣足食的农民；而另一方面，又必须使绝大多数农民“由个体逐步地向集体方向发展”。在向集体方向发展的过程中，不但需要在生产劳动方面发展变工互助，而且还要在供给工具、种子、原料和运销农产品的方面，普遍地有系统地建立供销合作社，以促进农民生产的发展，使农民由少受以至不受商人的剥削。这就是说，我们在领导农业经济的发展时，一方面，必须反对各种各样的空想的农业社会主义思想，与好吃懒做、安于贫穷、以贫穷为光荣的糊涂思想作斗争；另一方面，又必须反对对于农业经济的发展放弃无产阶级的领导，主张完全的自由竞争，让其自流发展的资本主义的路线。新民主主义的农业经济的发展道路，应该是逐步地——起初是在供销及生产互助方面，然后是在农产品集体生产方面——引向合作社方向发展的道路。
    （乙）政策问题
    为着发展农业生产，就要确立与巩固广大群众生产发家，勤劳致富的思想，以发动广大农民的生产积极性，并且教育与引导成千成万分散的个体农民，逐渐地走向集体化的道路。这是我们政策的出发点。关于政策问题，除组织生产的互助合作外，主要包括以下四个问题：
    一、确定与巩固土地改革后农村各阶层的私有权；二、公平合理与公私兼顾的负担政策；三、生产奖励政策；四、生产教育政策。现在分别加以说明如下。
    第一、关于确定与巩固农村各阶层财产私有权问题，必须确认土地改革后的农村经济，仍然是分散的、个体的经济，土地改革的结果，只是废除了封建的私有制，代之以农民的私有制。因之，在一切已经完成土改的基本区，必须确定与巩固这种新的私有制，才有利于现阶段经济的发展。这里主要包括以下各点：
    甲、对于已经分配了的一切封建的土地财产，承认其属于各人所有，允许各人自由处理。并颁发地照、房照、确定地权、房权。
    乙、对于分配错了的中农的土地财产，进行补偿。已经补偿过的（即被斗中农已补偿至一般贫雇农平分后所有的标准），立即宣布地权、财权不再变动，未补偿的，在号召贫雇农自愿帮助，合理解决，或由国家用减收公粮及其他办法加以解决。并限定时间做完，决不再拖。
    丙、确保自己劳动、雇人经营、正当债息收入、与特定条件下出租土地之所得，完全归自己所有。任何人不得侵犯。
    丁、承认各人自由经营的权利，保障交换自由，奖励发展生产。
    戊、实行自愿和两利的生产合作互助政策，反对强迫编组生产，与一切在合作互助中侵犯农民私有权的现象。
    己、取消某些农会或贫农团、换工队等各种形式的财产公有制，恢复农民的财产私有制。农民在反封建斗争中，一切经济果实，如尚有未分配者，除高级政府所规定者外，均可彻底分配，并归个人所有。
    庚、土地改革后的原来是地主富农分子的劳动所得，同样予以保护，其在土改时期未经分配保留下来的各种财物，只要他用到生产方面，亦予保护。
    辛、对于一切地主、土匪、流氓破坏农村生产秩序的行为，必须严惩。
    上列数点，都是确定与巩固土地改革后农村各阶层私有权所必须实行的步骤。凡是这样做了的地区，各阶层的生产情绪，就由动荡走向安定，由消极转为积极，而广大群众生产发家、勤劳致富的思想，也就确立与发展起来。因之，在已经这样做了的地方，要认真检查，进一步提高群众生产致富的思想；没有做，或做得不好的地方，就要认真去做。
    第二、关于公平合理与公私兼顾的负担政策问题。
    应该在恢复与发展生产的基础上，继续支援全国人民解放战争，不再加重并尽量减轻民负，以便于恢复和发展生产，一方面支援战争，一方面逐步地改善人民生活。这个政策应该包括下列各项：
    甲、按照各地常年产量，规定与统一农业税率，以平衡负担，刺激农民生产。乙、调整城乡的负担比例，以便城乡负担不过分悬殊。丙、合理地使用民力，规定更适合于我区人民的战时勤务负担条例。丁、对于缺乏劳动力的军人与工作人员的家属，实行公平合理的代耕制度。
    第三，生产奖励政策，应该包括：
    甲、奖励与保护繁殖牲畜；乙、奖励精耕细作；丙、奖励开垦荒地，兴修水利；丁、奖励劳动英雄与模范工作者；戊、奖励副业生产、与发展手工业合作社；己、扶助移民；庚、奖励特种作物（特别是南满与热河的棉麻）的生产，发展工业原料与奖励商品粮食的生产；辛、奖励提高群众生产的各种技术发展。
    第四、加强区村干部与群众的生产教育。一切农村工作的同志，都要学习农业生产知识，培养农业生产干部与合作事业干部。
    （丙）关于组织生产的合作互助与供销合作社问题。
    土地改革以后，由于土地、牲畜、农具的分散和自然灾害等困难，由于东北农业经营的特点是需要一定数量的牲口、工具才能耕作，由于土地改革后农村中大批的地主、游民及一部富农分子，需要采取适当的方式组织他们到生产战线中来，因之，组织农村的生产合作换工，成为一个十分迫切的问题。
    今年农村生产合作互助，对于保证耕地不荒、按时耕种铲趟，克服各种灾荒，调节战争勤务与生产的矛盾，起了很大作用。但由于干部思想上的急性病、与作风上的某些毛病，也走了不少弯路。必须指出，其中有些地方是受农业社会主义思想的影响。
    春耕时，许多地方本质相同、形式不一的所谓“农业合作社”、“大把菁”、“合伙种地”、“集体喂马”等不为现时经济条件所许可的生产组织，在东北局的指示之下，迅速取消了。但纠正这种现象之后，不少地区违反自愿和两利原则的强迫命令的形式主义的生产合作组织，仍极严重。应该指出，这种生产组织，对于群众生产积极性的提高是无益有害的。必须坚决改进。
    各地关于组织农村生产合作的经验是：
    一、必须坚持自愿和两利（即等价交换）的原则，必须是在自愿和两利基础上合作互助的生产组织，这是组织起来的根本原则；否则就一定要失败。为了彻底保障自愿和两利原则的实行，必须允许一切加入合作互助的人员可以随时自由退出。
    二、目前农村的合作互助生产组织，一般以小型的按季节性的分散的形式为宜。可以多采用随时有需要就组织，不需要就解散的灵活的方式。在这个基础上，加以可能的逐步的提高，但不要勉强地去提高，更不要勉强地去巩固。
    三、明年可能有少数农民，有力量单独拴起一付犁杖来，因而退出现在的生产合作组织。为了鼓励农民买马的兴趣，只要他们能够将地种上，并愿意单独经营，是完全可以和应该允许他们这样做的，而且在目前条件下这样做，对刺激大多数农民的生产积极性，是有好处的。
    除上述农业生产中的互助组织外，还必须在农村中普遍地从上至下地建立供销合作社，以建立无产阶级领导的国家经济对于农民小生产经济的联系和领导，减少商人的中间剥削，尽可能廉价地供给农民所需要的各种生产资料和生活资料，公道地收买和运销农民生产品，以提高农业生产力和发展各种农村副业。其方法应首先建立东北供销合作总社及各省省社，再选择若干县及乡为重点去征求社员，进行营业，以便取得经验和群众拥护后，再加以推广。供销合作社的唯一任务，就是协助社员生产，保护社员利益，避免商人剥削。它必须以比较廉价的工具和商品供给农民，又以公道的价格收买和运销农民多余的粮食和原料及副业生产品，从而保护社员利益；而不应以剥削社员或非社员群众从而营利分红为目的，如普通商人的作法一样，农村中的党与政府必须派出大批最好的干部去办理供销合作社，并用心学习做生意，但不是学习象商人那样如何去剥削农民和小生产者，而是学习如何能使他们减轻以至免除这种剥削，以便使合作社有强的领导骨干。必须定期召开合作社的社员大会及各级代表大会与代表会议，使领导骨干与群众有经常密切的联系。国家必须帮助合作社的资金，并从税收运输及定货方面给好的供销合作社以各种优待。我们同志应该了解这种供销合作事业的巨大重要性，而不应该有重农轻商的观点。须知在小商品经济的范围内，商业是可以控制农业甚至破坏农业的，没有合理的商业，就不能使小农业有合理的发展。由于封建剥削消灭、解放战争胜利、大城市解放、大工业发展的条件下，农产品必然大量地商品化，因此无产阶级领导下的农村供销合作社必将日益发展成为新民主主义社会中农村商品生产的指挥机关。由于这种供销合作社在今天还极不发达，还没有在全党内引起严重的注意和建立正确的认识，我们在今天必须对于这一工作给予更大的重视。应当指出：办好农村供销合作社，与提高农业生产技术，发展农业生产互助，具有同等的重要性。办得好的供销合作社，是组织农村生产与消费的枢纽。要提高农村生产，仅仅依靠党政机关在行政上去指挥还是不够的，还必须建立经济上的指挥机关，这个经济上的指挥机关之一，就是农村供销合作社。各级党政机关必须以最大的注意去建立真正能够代表群众利益的供销合作社。过去许多合作社办理不善的，如用投机商人的办法去剥削群众，以营利分红为唯一目的者，必须坚决加以纠正和取缔。
    许多在农村工作的干部感觉自己在发展农村生产方面没有很多事情好作。因为提高农业生产技术，往往需要专门知识，而他们又往往没有或很难有这种专门知识。组织农业生产互助，又只能按照农民的自愿去作，我们的干部除了号召和从旁协助外，也不能有更多的事情好作；如果他们想作更多的事情，再加以急性病，他们就常常走上强迫命令的路子。然而他们不知道很好地去组织供销合作社，以便初步地把全体农民组织起来。这正是我们的农村工作干部在今天提高农村生产方面所应努力的基本环节。
    一切国家经济机关都应扶助合作社，特别是商业部与各地贸易局应把扶助合作社的正当发展看做是自己的基本任务。这种扶助，首先就是要比较廉价地供给合作社以农民的生产资料和生活资料，并销售合作社从农民中收买来的生产品。
    （丁）关于提高农业生产力问题。
    根据目前情况，提高农业生产力，主要有以下几项问题：
    一、保护牲畜与繁殖牲畜。耕畜在东北农业生产力中所占地位极重要。但近年来牲畜死亡率极大，如嫩江四十万牲口中，即死四万，这是一个极为严重的问题。
    应该采取下列办法，减少牲口的死亡：
    （一）牲口分给谁的，即归谁所有，未分配的要加以分配。反对集体所有制与集体喂马。在合作互助生产中要规定合理的马工价，使养马者有利可图。（二）依据各地情况，动员群众搭盖牛马圈棚。（三）训练兽医人才，建立保畜组织，省设牲畜防疫所，进行防疫注射。（四）最重要的是准备足够的马草马料（谷草、豆荚、活草、豆饼等），防止耕畜饿病致死。
    关于繁殖牲畜，除选配好的马种、牛驴种外，应该以区为单位，建立专门的牛马配种站，有计划地繁殖牲畜，并设法从牲口多的地区，购买牲口到缺乏牲口的地区。对繁殖牲口与添进牲口的，要在负担、税务等各方面给以适当的减免，以资奖励。
    二、防备水灾与兴修水利。东北盆地甚多，易遭水害。今年全区遭受水灾的耕地面积约为三十万垧；修渠筑坝，挖顺水沟，而避免水患的良田为四四零、三一三垧，可知这个问题何等重要。东北行政委员会必须有计划地修几条大渠与大堤，各省在本省范围内，也要定出修渠筑堤计划，各区村要组织群众挖顺水沟，以便防止水患，恢复与扩大水田。必须了解水利对增产意义极大，东北的自然条件，又极有利于发展水利。因之，只要条件具备的地方，当地党政即应领导群众，恢复与兴修水田。关于防水治水与兴修水利工作，应统一计划，由政府颁发水利贷款，由各级分工负责，动员与依靠群众，有组织有计划地进行，并作长期打算，反对各自为政。
    三、改良农作法。要提倡造肥施肥，修整土地，精耕细作，多铲多趟；提倡制造与逐渐地、逐次地改良农具，以省为单位，有重点地与办农具工厂，小的县份与市镇，利用铁匠炉制造简单农具，以供农民的需要；提倡选种与消除虫灾，有重点地举办农业试验场，改良品种，试种冬麦。以省为单位，骋请农业专门人材，加以科学指导，进行各种改良农业技术的实际和研究，并培养农业干部。
    四、关于公营农场，应提起各地的重视。因为它是目前农业生产力发展的代表，对各地农业生产有极大的示范作用，应该对它扩大投资，减少它的财政任务。各省各县凡有条件的都可举办农场。一切农场都应做到经营合理，机器集中使用，管理企业化，以达到既能盈利，又有助于当地农业技术的改良。
    五、农业贷款应集中使用于农业建设的投资，首先是要经过供销合作社尽量供给农民的生产资料。应改变过去那种赈济观点与分散使用的做法，以便依靠农贷，真正办好几件与农业建设有关的事。至于某些农民的生活困难，主要地应当依靠农民之间的调剂、兴办养仓与银行的低利贷款解决。
    （三）半老区及新区的土改工作。
    全东北除百分之七十的基本区外，尚有三种地区：
    一、半老区：这种地区，土地大体上已平分，但不彻底，一般地也不需要来一次全面的平分，可实行较大范围内的调剂。
    二、新区：其中一部分地区，也经过清算和土改，但极不彻底，封建制度依然存在，地主富农仍占有大量的土地财产，贫雇农仍然是人多地少。另一部分地区则根本还未进行土地改革。这两种地区均应于今年秋冬两季实行平分土地。
    三、边沿区及游击区：即敌人武装尚未全部肃清、环境尚不安定，基本群众的绝大多数尚无分地要求。在这种地区，今年秋冬两季不实行土地改革，只实行减租减息的社会政策，及公平合理的负担政策，以便集中力量，消灭国民党一切武装力量，打击政治上最反动的少数恶霸分子，提高农民的觉悟。
    凡半老区及新区，今年秋冬两季调剂土地及实行平分时，必须根据中央一九四八年土地改革工作及整党工作的指示，接受去年平分土地的教训，经过周密考虑，定出具体计划。执行时应注意：
    甲、区别不同情况，提出不同的要求。如过去已实行过土改的地方，应力争在明年春耕前彻底消灭封建，完成平分土地；凡过去尚未进行土改的地方，应力争春耕前分完土地，基本上满足基本群众土地的要求，并解决其主要的生产资料的困难，以利明年春耕；凡今年尚不能进行土改的地方，则绝不应勉强。
    乙、抽调必要数量和质量的干部，开好干部会，认真学习毛主席在晋绥干部会上的讲话，任弼时同志关于土地改革中的几个问题的讲演，中央关于老区、半老区土地改革工作与整党工作的指示，关于一九四八年土地改革工作和整党工作的指示，关于一九三三年两个文件的决定，以及东北局关于平分土地运动的基本总结，使所有参加土地改革的干部，对中央和东北局所规定的各项政策及划阶级的方法，求得完全了解，并在工作中贯彻执行，不得擅自修改。在工作步骤上，必须坚决反对急性病，根据不同地区及干部和群众的条件，采取波浪式的逐步推进方法。
    内、在土地改革中，必须结合整党建党，纠正去年平分运动中旧干部一律解职，“搬石头”、“抬破车”等错误作法，并与土地改革同时，建立县区村三级人民的代表会议。
    丁、进行土地改革与准备生产是一个统一的任务。因此，必须严防一切破坏与浪费现象，使一切斗争果实如土地、耕畜、农具、粮食及其他浮产，均能合理地分配，真正地用之于解决基本群众明年生产的需要和困难，并注意在土地改革中结合组织群众，进行冬季副业生产。
    总之，今年半老区及新区的土地改革工作能否搞好，就看是否能够在土地改革中正确地执行和贯彻中央的政策，并做好明年生产的一切准备工作。这也就是东北局对半老区及新区在明年春耕前完成土地改革的基本要求。
    （四）明年的任务。
    今后在基本地区，农村党的基本任务，就是领导人民发展农业与副业生产，并在促进农业与副业生产的基础上办好农村生产合作互助组织和供销合作社，以便更有力地支援前线与发展人民经济。
    各地必须利用今年秋冬两季充分完成明年大生产运动的一切准备工作，以便到明年开展一个完全没有封建束缚的，各阶层人民得以在自由平等的条件下比赛生产致富的普遍生产运动。
    除掉那些只有工商业没有农业的城市或工厂企业中的党委，应把发展工业生产当做唯一的任务外，各省委一般地应把农工业生产提在并重的地位，县及县以下的一切地方党政组织与干部，则应以领导农业生产为基本任务，这也就是我们农村群众工作的基本内容。一切地方组织与农村党的工作，必须适应这种情况，来一次大转变。必须象我们在动员一万二千干部下乡时那样，全党动员起来，加油加劲，组织与领导明年东北解放区的大生产运动。
    根据今年全东北（冀察热辽除外）耕地面积，人力、畜力的统计，争取明年总产量达到较今年增产百分之十五、即一百八十万吨。
    增产的基本方针，应以精耕细作，提高产量为主，以奖励开荒，扩大耕地面积为辅。即依靠精耕细作完成增产量的百分之七十（每垧地增产一百公斤）；依靠修水田完成百分之十（兴修水田八十万垧）；依靠开荒完成百分之二（开荒四十到五十万垧）。此外还应根据各地不同情况，发展群众的副业生产。
    为着实现这一任务：
    第一、需要计划性。农业部要与商业部及其他有关部门合作制订一个一九四九年的农业生产计划及农村的供销计划。各省县各区村也要根据总的计划，定出当地勿惊虚名而切合实际的计划。关于农业建设方面，应该从长期打算，不仅要看到明年，还要看到今后两三年，看到将来。
    第二、要因地制宜。东北地区广大，各地自然条件，工作历史都有很大的差别，各地应该根据当地情况，加以分析，以规定当地的具体任务与做法。
    第三、要很好地总结与学习今年领导农村生产的经验，好的加以推广与提高，错误不再重犯。
    我们必须把东北解放区的农业生产提高一步，以便更有力地支援全国的解放战争与促进东北的工业生产的发展和改善东北人民的生活。虽然我们今天还处在中国革命战争最紧张的关头，但伟大的新民主主义国家的建设工作，就已经在我们这里开始了。让我们全党紧急动员起来，争取农业生战线上的胜利。
