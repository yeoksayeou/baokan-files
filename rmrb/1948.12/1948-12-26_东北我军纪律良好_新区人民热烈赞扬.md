　　Northeast People's Liberation Army Has Excellent Discipline
  　People in Newly Liberated Areas Warmly Praise Them
    [Jizhong Branch News Agency Frontline, 22nd dispatch] The Northeast People's Liberation Army's strict discipline upon entering the city has been deeply supported and praised by all sectors of the newly liberated towns. On the 14th, as our army advanced towards Tianjin and Beijing, Chiang Kai-shek's bandits at Langfang, Wanzhuang, and other stations along the Beining Railway fled in a panic. A certain unit of the Northeast People's Liberation Army was stationed at each station, and after local staff arrived, they handed over the warehouses one by one, and assisted in the development of work in the new areas. The unit received two barrels of gasoline, preparing to transport them for use, but later discovered that they were privately owned. They immediately returned them and apologized to the original owner. A certain unit bought dozens of catties of pork. Due to the inconsistency of currency values (Great Wall notes and Border Region currency), the price per catty of meat was 4,000 Border Region currency lower than the market price. After discovering that the merchant was losing money, they immediately compensated the full amount. The merchant was extremely grateful. Our army's trading is fair and courteous, and the residences are cleaned exceptionally well. The people in the newly liberated areas are all amazed, saying, "This is an army that fell from the sky!"

　　东北我军纪律良好
  　新区人民热烈赞扬
    【冀中分社前线二十二日电】东北解放军入城纪律严格，深受新解放城镇各界拥护赞扬。十四日我军向平津进军，北宁路廊坊、万庄等车站蒋匪，仓慌逃跑后，东北解放军某部进驻各车站，候地方工作人员到达，即将仓库一一交代清楚；并协助展开新区工作。该部接收两筒汽油，准备输用，后来发觉是私人的，马上又送回来，并向原主道歉。某单位买了几十斤猪肉，因币值（长城券和边币）不统一，每斤肉价低于市价四千边币，发觉商人吃亏后，立即照数补偿。商人感谢不已。我军买卖公道，态度和霭，住地打扫的分外清洁。新区人民都惊异的说：“这是天上掉下来的军队呀！”  （许彦章）
