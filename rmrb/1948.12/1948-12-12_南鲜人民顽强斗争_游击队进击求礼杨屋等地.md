Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 8th. Reports from various sources: Regardless of the brutal suppression by the American occupation authorities and Korean traitors, the South Korean people continue to fight for the independence and liberation of their motherland. According to Agence France-Presse, Seoul, on November 30th, leaflets and pamphlets were simultaneously discovered in the Seoul Power Plant, the General Post Office, the Seoul News Agency, the Seoul Academy of Arts, and other places, calling for a two-hour general strike demanding the withdrawal of American troops. In late November, a unit of people's guerrillas, numbering approximately 900, attacked Gorye, 60 miles north of the Han River. Subsequently, Yangwu, 75 miles southeast of Seoul, was also attacked by people's guerrillas. This location houses a huge power plant that supplies half of South Korea's electricity. Under the supervision of the American authorities stationed in South Korea, the South Korean puppet regime is frantically using terror to suppress the people's movement. According to Agence France-Presse, Seoul, the puppet police chief, Kim Tae-sun, has ordered the 8,000 police officers in Seoul to immediately execute those who distribute "treasonous" leaflets. In the hours before dawn on the 3rd, police conducted searches in various districts of Seoul, arresting 700 people. This was the first major arrest since the "Security Law" came into effect on the 1st of this month. The South Korean puppet National Assembly has recently passed a bill to conscript all young men into the army, which will be implemented soon. From December 1st, all middle schools in South Korea will conduct four hours of compulsory military training per week under the guidance of military officers. At the same time, 16,000 young people in Seoul have been forced to join the Security Corps, an organization formed by the police authorities in imitation of the Japanese fascist civilian corps before the end of World War II.

    南鲜人民顽强斗争
    游击队进击求礼杨屋等地
    【新华社陕北八日电】各方报导：不顾美国占领当局与韩奸的残暴镇压，南朝鲜人民继续为祖国的独立解放而斗争。据法新社汉城讯，十一月三十日，汉城电力厂、邮政总局、汉城新闻社、汉城艺术科学院及其他各地，同时发现小册子与传单，呼吁发动两小时总罢工，要求美军撤退。十一月下旬，人民游击队一部约九百余人，曾袭击汉水以北六十英里之求礼。其后，汉城东南七十五英里处之杨屋，复为人民游击队所袭击，该处设有供给南朝鲜所用电力半数的巨大电力厂。在美国驻南朝鲜当局监督下的南朝鲜傀儡政权，正慌乱地不断以恐怖手段，压制人民运动。据法新社汉城讯，伪警察局长金泰善，一日已命令汉城八千警察对散发“谋叛”传单者即行枪决。三日黎明前数小时，警察在汉城各区进行搜捕，被捕者七百人，这是本月一日“保安法”实施以来的首次大逮捕。南朝鲜伪国会近已通过征召一切青年男子当兵的法案，不日即将实施。自十二月一日起，南朝鲜各中学均将在军官的指导下进行每周四小时的强迫军训。同时，汉城一万六千青年已被迫参加保安团，该团系警察当局模仿第二次大战结束前日本法西斯民团的组织而组成的。
