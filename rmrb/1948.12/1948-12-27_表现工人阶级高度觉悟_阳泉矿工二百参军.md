	Demonstrating the High Awareness of the Working Class
  	200 Yangquan Miners Join the Army
	[Yangquan News] The broad masses of miners in Yangquan City are excited and encouraged on the eve of national victory, and their awareness has been further enhanced. They are vying to enlist in the army in order to further strengthen the backbone of the proletariat in the troops. As of the 13th of this month, 206 people in the city have joined the army. Under their leading influence, a city-wide upsurge in joining the army has been formed. On the morning of the 13th, more than a thousand people from various agencies, schools, and representatives from all walks of life in Yangquan City gathered to bid farewell to these outstanding sons and daughters of the people who were joining the army. After speeches by the chairman and representatives, the new soldiers held a solemn swearing-in ceremony. Wang Shuangquan, a worker from Zhicheng Iron Works, said, "I hope to go to the front line as soon as possible and capture the bandit Chiang. I have a fiancée, but we haven't gotten married yet. I won't mention it now. I'll capture Chiang Kai-shek and then get married." Finally, he also guaranteed that all his comrades in the class would perform meritorious service on the front line. Another young worker who had just reached the age told everyone that he had been forced by Yan Xishan into a homeless beggar. After liberation, the democratic government provided relief and helped him with production, which gave him a way to live. He expressed to everyone that he would not return until he had captured the bandit Chiang. Most of them were liberated workers and peasants who had turned themselves over. Their speeches fully demonstrated their awareness and determination. During the meeting, students from vocational high schools and primary schools vied to present flowers to the new soldiers and their families. The new soldiers with honorary flowers all had smiles on their faces. An old lady of a military family happily threw pears into the crowd of new soldiers, causing cheerful laughter among the new soldiers. After joining the army, the new soldiers immediately requested to go to the front line. They automatically elected representatives to the new recruits management office, requesting to be sent to the replenishment regiment immediately, so that they could go to the front line as soon as possible. They said: "The sooner we go to the front line, the sooner we will defeat Chiang Kai-shek!"
