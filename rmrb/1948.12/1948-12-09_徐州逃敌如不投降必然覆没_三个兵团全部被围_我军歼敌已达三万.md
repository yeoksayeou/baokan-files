Xinhua News Agency, Huaihai Front, December 6th: The Kuomintang army's Qiu Qingquan, Li Mi, and Sun Yuanliang three army corps, totaling twenty-two divisions, and a large number of Chiang Kai-shek's party, government, and military personnel who fled from Xuzhou, have been heavily surrounded by our army in the triangle area of ​​Xiaoxian, Yongcheng, and Dangshan counties. From the 2nd to the afternoon of the 4th, our army annihilated up to 20,000 of the enemy, including more than 14,000 captured alive. Seized two howitzers, three mountain guns, more than 300 vehicles, five tanks, and five armored vehicles. The enemy has been fleeing for days, lacking both food and ammunition, suffering from hunger and cold, and in extreme chaos. If they do not surrender quickly, the entire army will inevitably be wiped out.

Xinhua News Agency, Huaihai Front, December 7th: The People's Liberation Army completed the complete encirclement of the enemy's Qiu Qingquan, Li Mi, and Sun Yuanliang three army corps at dawn on the 4th in the areas of Mengji, Lishilin, and Wangbolou, more than forty miles northeast of Yongcheng. The three army corps were commanded by Du Yuming, deputy commander-in-chief of the enemy's Xuzhou "Suppression Headquarters," and consisted of nine armies, twenty-two divisions, and other special forces and rear service organs, totaling about 200,000 people. As of noon today, the number of enemies annihilated by the People's Liberation Army has increased to more than 30,000. Among those annihilated above the regimental level, it has been verified that the entire independent brigade (now changed to the 44th Division) of the Second Army Corps, the entire 137th Regiment and 138th Regiment of the 46th Division of the Fifth Army, the entire 96th Regiment of the 32nd Division of the 70th Army, and the entire 125th Regiment of the 42nd Division of the Eighth Army have been annihilated. The People's Liberation Army's offensive is fierce, and the enemy's morale is low. On the 4th, a unit of the People's Liberation Army annihilated four entire battalions of the enemy's 42nd Division in only one hour of combat with four companies in Haohanlou. On the same day, one battalion of the 136th Regiment of the enemy's 46th Division revolted and joined the People's Liberation Army, and one battalion of the 137th Regiment surrendered to us. On the night of the 5th, another battalion and five companies belonging to the enemy's Ninth Army continued to surrender to us in Malou and Wangbolou. Countless others have defected, dispersed, and fled in disguise at the front lines. The enemy has now been compressed into a small area of ​​about twenty miles in length and breadth, centered on Lishilin, trapped in an isolated and helpless situation, awaiting the arrival of their annihilation.

    【新华社淮海前线六日电】由徐州向西南方向溃窜的国民党军邱清泉、李＠、孙元良三个兵团共二十二个师及大批由徐州逃出的蒋匪党政军机关人员，已在萧县、永城、砀山三角地区陷入我军的重围。自二日到四日午后止，我军已歼该敌达两万，内生俘一万四千余人。缴获榴弹炮两门、山炮三门、汽车三百余辆、坦克五辆、装甲汽车五辆。该敌连日奔逃，粮弹两缺，饥寒交迫，混乱不堪。如不迅速投降，必然全军覆没。
    【新华社淮海前线七日电】人民解放军于四日拂晓在永城东北四十余里之孟集、李石林、王伯楼地区完成对敌邱清泉、李＠、孙元良三个兵团之完全包围。该三个兵团由敌徐州“剿总”副总司令杜韦明指挥，共辖九个军，二十二个师，及其他特种部队、复方机关共约二十余万人。迄今日午时止，解放军歼敌数字已增至三万余。其中整团以上被歼者，已查明有第二兵团之独立旅（现已改为四十四师）全部，第五军四十六师之一三七团、一三八团全部，七十军三十二师之九十六团全部，第八军四十二师之一二五团全部。解放军攻势猛烈，敌军士气低落。四日解放军某部在郝汉楼以四个连兵力，仅历一小时战斗即歼敌四十二师四个整营。同日敌四十六师之一三六团一个营起义加入解放军，一三七团一个营向我役降。五日夜续有敌第九军所属一个营又五个连在马楼及王伯楼向我投降。其他零星在前线向我投诚、溃散及化装逃跑者不计其数。现敌已被我压缩于以李石林为中心，纵横约二十里之狭小地区，陷于孤立无援的绝境，等待着被歼命运的到来。
