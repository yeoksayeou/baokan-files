　　【Jizhong 12th Dispatch】 In Baoding City, the number of factories and shops that have resumed operations has reached 4,418, including those dealing in grain, cotton cloth, ironwork, weaving, hardware, medicine, leather, porcelain, ironware, sauce and pickle shops, and bookstores. All the shops in the city's famous Tianhua and other markets, as well as the Le Ren Tang old pharmacy and the Huai Mao pickle shop, have successively resumed operations. More than 1,000 industrial and commercial households are preparing to open in the coming days. When the city was first liberated, some industrial and commercial households had many concerns, such as "Will the hat market's industry and commerce also be divided equally?" and "How should labor-management relations be handled?" which made them afraid to resume operations boldly. Later, the democratic government used forums such as merchant symposiums to vigorously publicize the current situation and explain our party's policies on industry and commerce. Coupled with the strict discipline of our army and practical actions to protect industry and commerce, industrial and commercial households began to break through their ideological concerns and resume operations one after another. In recent days, farmers from all over the countryside have been flocking to the city to buy and sell goods, and the main streets are exceptionally lively. Some prices have begun to fall.
　　【Another Dispatch】 The Baoding Electric Company resumed power supply on the 6th, and the whole city was brightly lit. This fact shows the unparalleled greatness of the people's construction power. Three months before the liberation of Baoding, the company stopped supplying electricity due to a coal shortage. When the Liu bandit Hua Nan fled, he wantonly destroyed the company, and the office building in the north and the materials warehouse were set on fire by the Liu bandit. More than 1,000 catties of copper wire alone were lost. The water pipes and storage tanks of the power plant were also destroyed, and the factory inside and outside were covered with scorched earth, with half a foot of soil accumulated on the generators. The Liu bandit also threatened and coerced most of the company's important staff and engineers, attempting to prevent the people from resuming work after liberating Baoding. However, the day after the city was liberated (the 23rd of last month), under the call of the democratic government, more than 80 employees of the factory immediately resumed work. Under the active leadership of veteran workers Liu Fasheng, Li Ziru and others, two generators with 300 and 881 kilowatts, as well as water pipes and storage tanks, were quickly repaired. Line workers went to various streets to repair the power lines and poles that had been destroyed by the Chiang bandits, and installed lines, without resting on Sundays, and persevered until the repairs were completed before coming down from the poles. Squad leader Shi Jiandong went out late at night to check the lines in various places. Under the leadership of the democratic government, various difficulties were overcome, and the serious coal shortage was resolved, enabling the electric company, which had been severely damaged by the Liu bandit, to resume work quickly.

　　保定工商业迅速恢复
  　四千余家已开工开业
  　电灯公司亦已恢复送电
    【冀中十二日电】保定市工厂商店先后复业者已达四千四百一十八户，其中包括粮食、棉布、铁工、织工、五金、医药、皮革、瓷器、铁货、酱园及书店等。该市著名的天华等市场全部商号及乐仁堂老药铺、槐茂酱园等，均已相继复业。尚有一千多工商户，正准备日内开张。该市刚解放时，某些工商户存在不少顾虑，如“帽市工商业是否也要平分”，“劳资关系怎样处理”等，致不敢大胆复业。后经民主政府利用商人座谈会等形式，大力宣传目前时局，讲解我党工商业等政策，加上我军纪律严明、保护工商业的实际行动，工商户开始打破了思想顾虑，纷纷复业。连日四乡农民纷纷进城买卖货物，各主要街道热闹异常。部分物价已开始下降。
    【又电】保定市电灯公司于六日起恢复送电，当时全城电灯大放光明。这一事实，显示了人民建设力量的无比伟大。保市解放前三个月，该公司即因煤荒停止送电。刘匪化南逃窜时，复对该公司大肆破坏，办公厅北大楼与材料库等房屋器材，皆被刘匪纵火烧毁。仅铜丝即损失一千余斤。发电厂的送水管、蓄水箱等，亦被击毁，工厂内外满地焦土，发电机上积土半尺。刘匪又将该公司大部重要职员、工程师威胁裹走，企图使人民解放保市后没法复工。但该市解放后第二天（上月二十三日），在民主政府号召下，该厂职工八十余名立即全部复工。在老工人刘发生、李子如等积极领导下，将三百与八百八十一基罗瓦特发电机两部，及送水管、蓄水箱等，迅速修理完竣。线路工人则分赴各处街道，抢修横遭蒋匪破坏的电线电杆，安接线路，星期日也不休息，一直坚持到修理完好，才下电杆。领班史兼东曾深夜出外检查各处线路。在民主政府领导下，排除了种种困难，又解决了严重煤荒，使遭到刘匪惨重破坏的电灯公司迅速复工。
