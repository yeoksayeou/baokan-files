    All-China Students’ Federation and Shijiazhuang Student Federation
    Propose Establishment of North China Student Federation
    [This Newspaper's Report] The All-China Students’ Federation and Shijiazhuang Student Federation have jointly proposed convening a student representative meeting in the North China Liberated Area to establish the North China Student Federation. The original text states: We, the students of All-China University and Shijiazhuang, felt very excited after seeing the November 5th announcement of the All-China Liberated Areas Youth Federation. Today, with the People's Liberation Army advancing rapidly and national liberation imminent, it is urgently necessary to quickly establish student federations at all levels in the liberated areas in order to unite the vast number of students, strengthen learning, strive for an earlier victory in the War of Liberation, and participate in the various construction tasks of the new China. Therefore, on the occasion of commemorating the glorious "December 9th" festival, we, the All-China University Student Union and the Shijiazhuang Student Federation, jointly propose convening a student representative conference in the North China Liberated Area to establish the North China Student Federation; at the same time, we suggest that students in secondary and higher education institutions in our North China Liberated Area quickly establish their own student federations and immediately send representatives to Shijiazhuang before December 15th to discuss the preparatory work for establishing the North China Student Federation.
    [This Newspaper's Report] Students and youth in Shijiazhuang solemnly commemorated "December 9th." On the eve of "December 9th," four secondary schools in the city held their first student representative meeting, resulting in the establishment of the city's student federation. At this meeting, important proposals such as jointly initiating the organization of the North China Student Federation with the All-China University Student Union were passed. Comrade Liu Xiufeng of the Shijiazhuang Municipal Committee called on all students at the meeting to study hard under the leadership of the student federation, establish a revolutionary outlook on life, and learn skills so that they can better serve the people in the future. On "December 9th," various schools held commemorations. The city's Municipal No. 1 Middle School also performed two student-written plays at an evening event. The content of the plays described the changes in their thinking over the past year since liberation, how they shattered the ideological shackles imposed by the years of enslavement and poisoning education by the Japanese invaders and Chiang Kai-shek bandits through personal experience, and how they gained complete ideological liberation, living a democratic, free, and happy new life. Furthermore, the city's Youth League Committee plans to convene a city-wide New Democratic Youth League members and youth representative conference between the two great festivals of the "December 9th" and "December 21st" student movements.
