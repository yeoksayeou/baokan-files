　　Select and Train Outstanding Elements to Greatly Open Up Sources of Cadres
    The Cadre Work of the Taihang Fifth Prefectural Committee Gains Experience
    [Taihang Electric] In order to promote a large number of cadres to fill existing vacancies and meet the needs of the new situation, the Taihang Fifth Prefectural Committee convened a meeting of the heads of the organization departments of various counties in September for discussion. It was decided that each county should promote a large number of new cadres and train the main village-level cadres to cultivate village-level leadership backbones, and to make training classes an important source for cultivating and promoting cadres. In the past two months, the entire special zone has promoted fourteen county-level cadres, eighty-six main district-level cadres, and more than five hundred general district cadres. Various counties have gained a lot of experience in promotion and training: (1) In the promotion of new cadres, a step-by-step approach of prudent selection and gradual transition is generally adopted to combine training and promotion. After the pre-selection and evaluation by the sub-committees, outstanding elements from the village cadres were selected. Then, they were concentrated in the county party committee organs for short-term training, and then participated in the land reform work groups in the hinterland, or the joint defense headquarters work groups in the border areas, or organized village-level work teams that were semi-detached from production. They were tempered and improved through work, and then selected as formal cadres. Secondly, in the standard for promoting new cadres, it is generally not necessary to demand too much. As long as they have good political qualities, clear class ideology, and have the potential for cultivation, they can be promoted to fill vacancies. Although new cadres lack experience and methods, they are enthusiastic, understand the situation, and have good contact with the masses. They can be improved through gradual cultivation. After the promotion of new cadres, the most important issue is to strengthen leadership and conduct more specific education. At present, the general methods adopted are regular reporting of personal work, study, and thoughts, strengthening the party day and party class system, and old cadres helping new cadres to summarize and check diligently. After a large number of new cadres have been promoted, the emotions of the old cadres have also been stimulated. The new cadres reflect the situation they understand in their work to the old cadres several times a day, and the old cadres feel that they cannot lead the new cadres without studying, and both sides are actively working and studying. In the selection of the main district-level cadres, it is generally more cautious. The selection criteria generally pay attention to political consciousness and the performance of current work; as well as the ability to work independently, etc. It should not be limited to seniority and qualifications. (2) In the process of intensive training and promotion of cadres, various counties have also discovered that the past assessment and evaluation system for cadres and the strict organizational life of the party were insufficient. In the leadership organizations at all levels, there is still a lack of a clear understanding of the standards for selecting cadres. Therefore, some counties have experienced phenomena of imprudence, lack of seriousness, and simply completing tasks to fill vacancies. In order to avoid these deviations, county and district leaders should establish a strict system for educating and reviewing cadres, so that the cultivation and promotion of cadres becomes regular work. (3) In terms of training content, in addition to policy education and party building education, current affairs education also stimulated the emotions of cadres. Therefore, the newly proposed cadres began to realize the political vision of leading the masses to "organize, become rich through production," and build a new democratic society, and their enthusiasm for work was even higher. (4) In order to promote a large number of cadres and meet the needs of current work, in addition to conducting general training for village party members, various training classes have also been opened in large numbers. Lin County has opened a training class for intellectuals, selecting more than ninety intellectuals, village financial and grain cadres, and primary school teachers who are politically pure in rural areas. Because these people are in the liberated areas, have a long period of rural work experience, and are directly influenced by the party's policies, they can be added to the leading organs to serve as clerks, secretaries, section members, assistants, accountants, and financial and grain systems after training. Xinxiang and Weihui cities are also preparing to open training classes for intellectuals, absorbing urban and rural intellectuals, and giving short-term training to intellectuals in the countryside. Select politically pure and progressive youths to participate in work. Attention was also paid to the cultivation of women cadres during the training. Experience has proved that the continuous intensive training of cadres and the continued operation of party school training classes should become an important source for the current selection of cadres. Otherwise, our cadre work will not keep up with the needs of the situation.

　　选拔训练优秀分子大量开辟干部源泉
    太行五地委干部工作获得经验
    【太行电】为大量提拔干部，补起现有缺额，与适应新形势的需要。太行五地委曾于九月召开各县组织部长会议作了讨论，决定各县要大量提拔新干部，并训练村级主要干部，培养村级领导骨干，要使训练班成为培养提拔干部的重要来源之一。两个月来，全专区已提拔了县级干部十四人。区级主要干部八十六人。一般区干部五百余人。各县在提拔与训练方面，并取得不少经验：（一）在提拔新干部上一般是采用了慎重选拔与逐渐过渡的步骤，使训练与提拔相结合。事先经过分委评定，选择了村干中优秀分子。然后集中县委机关，加以短期训练，即参加腹地的土改工作组，或边地联防指挥部工作组，或者组织村级半脱离生产的工作队。从工作中加以锻炼提高，然后选拔为正式干部。其次在提拔新干部的标准上，一般不应要求过高，只要政治上素质良好，阶级思想明确，有培养前途，就可提拔起来，补上缺额。新干部虽经验差办法少，但热情高，了解情况，与群众联系好，从逐渐培养中，即可提高。在新干部提起之后，最重要的问题是加强领导，多进行具体教育。现在一般是采用了定期汇报个人工作、学习、思想，加强党日党课制，老干部帮助新干部勤总结勤检查等办法。经过大量新干部的提拔，把老干部情绪也刺激起来了。新干部在工作中了解的情况，一天几次的给老干部反映，老干部便感到不学习就领导不了新干部，双方都在积极工作、学习。在区级主要干部的选拔上，一般的都比较慎重。选拔标准普遍注意到政治觉悟和当前工作的表现；以及独立工作能力等。不能单纯局限于资望、资格。（二）各县在集训和提拔干部中，也发现了过去对干部的鉴定、考核制度及严格过党的组织生活的不够，在各级领导组织中，还缺乏对选拔干部标准的明确认识。因此有些县发生不慎重、不严肃、为填补缺额单纯完成任务的现象。为避免这些偏向，县区领导上应建立教育与审核干部的严格制度，使培养与提拔干部，成为经常工作。（三）在训练的内容上，除政策教育与党建教育外，并结合时事教育鼓舞了干部情绪。因此新提出的干部，开始认识了领导群众“组织起来，生产致富”，建设新民主主义社会的政治远景，工作热情更高。（四）为大量提拔干部及适应当前工作的需要，除进行一般村庄党员的训练外，并大量开办了各种训练班。林县开办了知识分子训练班，选择农村中政治纯洁的知识分子、村财粮干部、小学教员九十余人。这些人因为身处解放区，有较长时期的农村工作锻炼，和党的政策的直接影响，训练后当可补充至领导机关担任干事、秘书、科员、助理员、会计及财粮系统等工作。新乡、卫辉市也准备开知识分子训练班。吸收城乡知识分子，在乡知识分子加以短期训练。选择政治纯洁和进步的青年，参加工作。训练中并注意培养了妇女干部。经验证明不断的集训干部和党校训练班的继续开办，应成为当前选拔干部的重要源泉。否则我们的干部工作，将赶不上形势的需要。
