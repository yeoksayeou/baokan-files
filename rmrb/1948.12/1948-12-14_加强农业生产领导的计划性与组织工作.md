Strengthening the Planning and Organization of Agricultural Production Leadership

In response to Chairman Mao's call to "increase production by an inch," a large-scale production movement will be launched in the entire North China Liberated Area next year. Thorough ideological and organizational preparations are essential beforehand, especially including detailed specific plans that have been thoroughly discussed, and research should begin now. To make this preparatory work more thorough and practical, we hope everyone will offer opinions and engage in discussions. We are publishing the views of Zhang Chong, Deputy Director of the Agricultural Department of the North China People's Government, below for everyone to study. --Editor

Two problems have been observed from this year's agricultural production leadership. First, land reform liberated the productive forces, but it is necessary to resolve the issues left over from land reform to eliminate farmers' ideological concerns and stabilize and encourage their productive enthusiasm. Second, it is necessary to actively solve the difficulties farmers face in production, which means carrying out "measures beneficial to production" in a planned and organized manner.

Regarding the first issue, it has been partially resolved during the conclusion of land reform and democratic party rectification, and it can basically be resolved this winter. This article will not discuss it further, but will focus on the second issue:

Several typical experiences in this year's production have already demonstrated the importance of the second issue and, at the same time, exposed the shortcomings in past production leadership. In the past, we were in a guerrilla warfare environment, blockaded and divided by the enemy, and constantly subjected to enemy mopping-up operations, killings, looting, and destruction. It was impossible to propose unified, longer-term plans for the entire region. However, it must be acknowledged that many places relied heavily on general calls to action and lacked specific plans and organizational work, often leading to calls to action falling flat. Now the situation is different. The North China Liberated Area has been connected as a whole in the victorious development of the revolutionary war, with a stable environment. Therefore, we can, and should, strengthen the planning and organization of production leadership.

Currently, North China not only has many small cities but also medium-sized cities. The liberation of the large cities of Beiping and Tianjin is also imminent. With modern industry and transportation, and with increased sources of tools and agricultural implements, the supply of industrial products will prepare excellent conditions for improving agricultural production. At the same time, it also gives us a greater and more arduous task, which is to increase agricultural production. This is not only for the farmers but also for the four to five million workers, students, and urban residents. This requires increasing the grain supply to cities by one billion catties, and increasing industrial raw materials such as cotton by 150 million catties and oil by hundreds of thousands of catties to supply factories. This not only guarantees the means of production and livelihood for the urban masses, but also allows farmers to gradually improve their production and living standards by exchanging them for tools, agricultural implements, and industrial products.

This overall task cannot be accomplished by general appeals. Concrete and practical methods are needed to complete it, which means strengthening the planning and organization of agricultural production leadership.

In the past, under enemy division and blockade, we had to implement a policy of self-sufficiency in production, and many places narrowed the scope of self-sufficiency to the county, district, and village (some even narrowed it to the self-sufficient household based on a natural economy). Even now, some county plans still propose the slogan of self-sufficiency. For example, in cotton planting policies: mountainous areas can only produce 10 to 15 catties of ginned cotton per mu, while plains can produce 20 to 30 catties, or even 50 to 60 catties or more. However, due to the enemy's division and blockade, it was necessary to promote cotton planting in mountainous areas at the time, and it did indeed solve certain difficulties. Today, the situation is different. The North China region has been connected as a whole, so there should be a planned division of labor, adapting to local conditions. In the plains, where crops are suitable, cotton planting should be promoted more extensively to supply mountainous and cold areas; while mountainous areas can grow more grain, hemp, etc. The value of what is produced is not low, and even special cold-resistant crops such as sugar beets, yams, and certain vegetables can exceed the harvest in plain areas. For example, during the War of Resistance, because land was not equally distributed, opening up wasteland in mountainous areas solved the difficulties of many poor and landless peasants and increased grain production. However, from the perspective of the entire region today, opening up wasteland in mountainous areas is very unfavorable. Because the Taihang Mountains have a lot of sand and gravel, opening up wasteland on the upper slopes makes it difficult to retain water and washes away a large amount of good land, exacerbating droughts and floods. There is a saying in Taihang: "Opening up the mountains of Heshun washes away the rivers of Yushe." After the equal distribution of land, the general practice should be to prohibit opening up wasteland in mountainous areas and adhere to the principle of relying on the mountains for sustenance and using the mountains to sustain themselves, cultivating forests, and breeding livestock. For local farmers, the effort is small, and the harvest is large; for the entire region, it can reduce floods and droughts, ensure timber supply, and increase livestock breeding. In the past, opening up canals and forming beaches also caused waste and losses due to lack of planning. For example, some canals caused excessive beach formation, narrowing the river channel, forcing floods, and washing away more beach land. Opening canals requires engineering plans and responsible engineers who sign off in advance due to insufficient planning, labor, and materials, or insufficient water volume, leading to disputes and even re-opening. In the future, opening canals and forming beaches should have prior engineering plans, with engineers responsible for signing off. River management and drainage require a unified plan and organization for the entire upstream and downstream.

Handicraft and sideline occupations are scattered and diverse, but in leading their development, blindness should be avoided as much as possible. In the past, due to blockade and division, great efforts were made to promote textiles in mountainous areas without raw materials or production technology, which solved part of the military and civilian needs. Now the situation has changed, and we should develop textiles in plain areas with conditions and foundations, while in mountainous areas, this should no longer be the focus. Other sideline occupations should be promoted in a planned way according to different conditions, such as managing mountain goods (from planting to selling semi-finished products), digging medicinal materials, promoting poultry and livestock farming, developing wool textiles, organizing the making of military shoes, and restoring and developing coal and iron production. In the development of sideline occupations, special emphasis should be placed on solving the needs and sales of finished products.

If the transportation and sales of products cannot be planned and organized, farmers will suffer great losses. When farmers harvest grain and want to sell it, grain prices fall, and other daily necessities they want to exchange it for rise in price; when farmers are idle and want to sell their handicraft and sideline products to exchange for grain, grain prices rise sharply again. Speculators seize on the weaknesses of small-scale farmers with little capital and low productivity to hoard and speculate for huge profits. The poorer they are, the less savings they have, and the greater the damage they suffer, and the greater the damage in the event of a disaster. Therefore, it is necessary to greatly develop supply and marketing cooperatives and state-owned stores to systematically purchase and sell finished products, and to provide them with means of production and daily necessities, so as to avoid serious exploitation by speculators. If the role of supply and marketing cooperatives and state-owned stores is not strengthened and supply and marketing are not solved in a planned way, and profits are not regulated (controlling market prices), it will be difficult for scattered small producers to develop.

Therefore, we must strengthen the planning and organization of production leadership and overcome blindness, so that farmers will not suffer losses, increase their income, and stimulate their enthusiasm to improve production. (⑴⑵)

To effectively improve agricultural production, it is also necessary to solve a series of problems such as water conservancy, animal husbandry, forestry, and seeds.

We have made great achievements in water conservancy construction in the past. In the original Jin-Cha-Ji Liberated Area alone, more than 3 million mu of paddy fields (equivalent to more than half of the existing irrigated land) were added in ten years. If canals are opened in a planned and organized way in the next two years, another 1.5 to 2 million mu of irrigated land can be added. If preparations are made this year, 1 million mu of irrigated land can be added in one year next year.

In the waterwheel and well business, this year we established a water conservancy promotion agency north of Shijiazhuang on the Pinghan Line and conducted a three-month experiment. More than 4,000 old waterwheels have been repaired and more than 1,000 new waterwheels have been added. Each waterwheel can irrigate about 30 mu of land, so the amount of grain produced will exceed the public grain burden in the area. At the same time, 27 iron factories and 86 blacksmith shops were supported, realizing that all loans were used for production, achieving 100% real-value preservation, and accumulating funds. If the small iron and woodworking factories and blacksmith shops in North China are organized in a planned way to repair and manufacture waterwheels and farmers dig wells, all old waterwheels can be repaired within two or three years. In 1949, half of them can be repaired and 12,000 new waterwheels can be added, which can increase paddy fields by 300,000 mu. Together with the repair of old waterwheels, the irrigated area can reach 1 million mu (increasing production by at least 1 shi per mu, which is an increase of 1 million shi).

Our region is very short of livestock. According to a typical survey of 14 counties and 23 villages in Beiyue and Jizhong, the number has decreased by 50% compared with before the war. Surveys in many counties and districts in Taihang also estimate that the number has decreased by half. This is a major problem for the recovery and development of agriculture. In addition to purchasing some supplements from other regions, the main thing is to rely on our own breeding, and our region has vast mountains, rivers, and grasslands. About 30 counties have breeding habits in the past, and about 300 villages and more than 25,000 households in Beiyue specialize in breeding livestock. If the strength of these villages and households is mobilized, more than 80,000 heads can be added in 1949, and the number can be doubled in 1950. In this way, the number of livestock in the entire region can be restored to the pre-war level within a few years.

North China is also very short of forests. It will be very difficult to carry out large-scale transportation and industrial construction in the future, and planting trees and afforestation is a great income for farmers and has many benefits, such as reducing floods and preventing wind and sand. More than half of our region is mountainous, and less than half is arable land, and less than one-third of Shanxi. Such mountainous areas are vast areas suitable for afforestation. As long as we solve the problem of protection and management, we can develop it. In addition to mountainous areas, our region has about 1.6 million mu of sandy wasteland, which is expanding every year, destroying fertile land. Farmers suffer from wind and sand and build walls to prevent it. If we can organize the masses to afforest in a planned way, we can eliminate 400,000 to 500,000 mu of sandy wasteland in five or six years and become a forest protection zone. This not only protects arable land from wind and sand damage, but also has a greater income than ordinary dry land crops, with less labor; this is equivalent to farmers increasing 400,000 to 500,000 mu of fertile land.

In improving seeds, we already have excellent varieties of crops such as wheat, millet, and sweet potatoes. On the rice beaches along the Tang River alone, using the same cultivation methods and fertilizers, the widespread use of excellent rice seeds can increase production by 10,000 shi. After three years of comparative experiments at the Linqing Farm, with the same land and cultivation methods, ordinary cotton produces 70 to 80 catties per mu, while good cotton seeds can produce about 300 catties. If we carry out seed improvement in a planned and organized way, the increase in production will be very considerable.

This is only from the increase in production of several specialized businesses, illustrating the importance of strengthening planning and organization. The overall problem for the entire region lies in correctly resolving the issues left over from land reform, eliminating production obstacles, organizing farmers under the active demand for getting rich, cultivating intensively, determining property rights after issuing land certificates, mobilizing farmers to protect land rights, repairing arable land, and eliminating wasteland. If the pre-war cultivation level can be restored within two or three years,耕二 (三) 锄三 (四) [plowing twice (or three times), hoeing three (or four times)], restoring the fertility of the land that has been used too tired, and increasing fertilizer by one-fifth to one-third, then the entire North China region will increase production by one-tenth within two years, that is, achieve Chairman Mao's call to "increase production by an inch." If we continue to develop for three or four years, through the efforts of all the people, we can strive to reach the pre-war level.

Another aspect of organizing production is preventing disasters. The North China region has drought nine years out of ten, and often suffers from floods, insect plagues, and wind, hail, and frost disasters, causing great losses every year, from millions of shi to tens of millions of shi. At present, we cannot completely eliminate disasters, but we should not relax possible measures. For droughts and floods, if we carry out water conservancy construction in a planned way, build security forests in the upper reaches, reduce floods by releasing silt, and build dikes and drain water in the lower reaches, as well as prepare for prevention in advance, we can reduce their severity in certain areas.

In areas prone to insect and disease disasters, prevention should also be planned, such as universal autumn plowing to remove weeds, inducing and killing moths before they occur, and timely catching and killing them in the early stages to prevent them from spreading. For disease prevention, such as changing seeds, selecting seeds, and soaking seeds, especially organizing and planning important insecticides and effective agents.

For wind, hail, and frost disasters, planting conditions or adaptable crops can also be gradually transformed, such as afforestation to prevent sand, and changing crops to prevent freezing and frost, etc.

In short, organizing work in a planned way can prevent problems before they occur, and disasters can be stopped in time, or at least mitigate their damage, to protect farmers' year-long labor results from less losses, and reduce and overcome the threat of disasters, which actually increases the harvest.

Although ordinary farmers generally have a plan for production, "poverty if you don't plan," the small-scale peasant economy itself is very blind. Therefore, we must give as much impetus and assistance as possible, mobilize and organize cooperation and mutual assistance (especially organizing supply and marketing cooperatives at present), provide loans and technical guidance, which requires production plans for various regions and even plans for the entire North China.

To make a production plan for a certain period, it is necessary to conduct in-depth investigation and research. The agricultural department must devote efforts to this work. At the same time, we have several years of experience in developing large-scale production. Last autumn and winter and this autumn and winter, almost all cadres went to the countryside during land reform and democratic party rectification, and have a further understanding of the countryside. Therefore, the county should first conduct village surveys and help villages make plans. With county and village plans, district and even entire North China plans can be made.

After the plan is formulated, it must be seriously organized, equipped with appropriate strength. In addition to organizing the overall strength and appropriate division of labor, it is also necessary to establish specialized organizations, such as organizing organizations such as water conservancy promotion agencies in order to develop water conservancy. In order to breed livestock and plant trees and afforestation, it is necessary to establish forestry and animal husbandry bureaus in certain areas. Organizations such as management offices, afforestation cooperatives, and promotion agencies. In order to improve agricultural technology, it is necessary to establish organizations such as farms. In order to solve the sales of products of the vast number of small producers and solve the supply of their tools, raw materials, and necessities, it is necessary to establish and strengthen cooperatives, etc.

Of course, if we want to improve production, we must mobilize the entire party, government, and people, and organize all cadres. However, various specialized businesses must have professional organizations and conduct strict supervision and inspection, and revise certain inappropriate places in the plan at any time to ensure its realization.

    加强农业生产领导的计划性与组织工作
    响应毛主席“生产长一寸”的号召，明年的全华北解放区将开展一个大生产运动。这里，事先必须有充分的思想准备与组织准备，特别是需要有经过详细讨论的各种具体计划，而且现在就应该着手研究。为了把这个准备工作作得更周密。更切合实际，希望大家提供意见，展开讨论。我们先把华北人民政府农业部副部长张冲同志的意见发表于后，以便大家研究。——编者          
    从今年农业生产的领导上看到两个问题。一是土地改革解放了生产力，但必需解决土改中遗留的问题，以扫除农民思想上的顾虑才能安定与鼓励其生产情绪：二是积极解决农民生产上的困难，也就是有计划有组织地进行“有利于生产的措施”。
    关于第一个问题，在结束土改与民主整党中已经得到部分的解决，今冬基本上可以得到解决，本文不去论述，现在专谈第二个问题：
    今年生产中几个典型的经验已经能够说明第二个问题的重要，同时，也暴露了过去生产领导上的缺点。过去我们处在敌人封锁分割的游击战争环境，经常受到敌人的扫荡烧杀掠夺破坏，不可能提出全区性的统一的较长期的计划来，但必须承认，许多地方一般号召多，缺乏具体的计划与组织工作，因而常使号召落空。现在情况不同了，华北解放区已在革命战争胜利的发展中连成一片，有了安定的环境，因之，我们可能，因而应该加强生产领导的计划性与组织工作。
    目前我们华北不但有了许多小城市，而且有了中等城市，平津大城市的解放亦为期不远。有了近代化的工业和交通，有了工具农具的增补来源。工业品的供给将给农业生产的提高准备很好的条件。同时，也给了我们更伟大而艰巨的任务，这就是提高农业生产。不但是为了农民，还要为了四五百万工人学生与市民，这就需要增加十亿个的粮市供给城市吃用，需要增加一亿五千万斤棉花几十万斤油等工业原料，以供给工厂的开工，这不只保证了城市群众的生产与生活资料，而且农民因此换得了工具农具及工业品而逐渐提高其生产与生活水平。
    这一总的任务，不是一般号召所能完成的，必须有具体的切合实际的办法，才能完成，也就是必须加强农业生产领导的计划性与组织工作。
    过去，在敌人分割封锁下，我们不得不实行生产的自给政策，而许多地方把自给的范围缩小到县、区、村（甚至有的缩小到自然经济的户自给）一直到现在还有的县计划中提出自给自足的口号，如在植棉政策上：山地植棉每亩只能产十到十五斤（皮棉），平原每亩却可产二三十斤，甚至五六十斤以上，但因敌人分割封锁当时是需要提倡山地植棉，事实上也确实解决了一定的困难。今天情况不同了，华北区已连成一片，就应当有计划的分工，要因地制宜，在适合作物的平原地区，更大量地提倡植棉，供给山地及寒冷地带；而山地则可多种些粮食、麻……等，所生产的价值并不低，甚至糖萝卜山药及某些菜蔬等耐寒的特种作物，还可以超过平原地区的收获。又如在抗战期间，因为没有平分土地，山地开荒曾解决了不少缺地无地的贫雇农的困难，增产了一部分粮食，但今天从全区看来，开山荒是十分不利的，因为太行山多砂石，上边开荒，山坡被开不易存水，冲坏大量的好地，助长旱灾水灾，太行有谚语：“开了和顺山，冲坏榆社川”。平分土地后，一般应禁开山荒，本靠山吃山，吃山养山的方针，培植森林，繁殖畜牧。对当地农民说，费力小，而收获大；对全区可减少水旱，并保证木材供给，增加牲畜繁殖。过去开渠成滩，也曾因无计划造成浪费与损失，如有的因为成滩过多，河道太窄，逼成水患，冲毁更多滩地。开渠因计划不足费工费料，或水量不足引起纠纷，甚至重开。今后开渠成滩，应事先有工程计划，工程师负责签字。治河泄水，更需上下游全部的统一计划，统一组织。
    手工业副业是分散的，多种多样的，但在领导其发展上，更应极力避免盲目性。过去因在封锁分割下，曾在没有原料没有生产技术的山地用了很大力量，提倡纺织，解决了部分的军需民用，现在情况变了，我们就应当在平原有条件、有基础的地方开展纺织，而在山地则不应再是大力提倡的方针，应有计划的按照不同条件提倡其他副业，经营山货（从种植到制成半成品出售），刨药材，提倡家禽畜养，发展毛纺织，组织作军鞋，恢复与发展煤铁业生产等。在副业发展上，尤其要着重解决生产成品的需要与运销问题。
    生产品的运销，如果不能有计划地指导与组织，农民就要受到很大的损失。当农民粮食收获后，要出卖时，粮价就下跌，要换回的其他日用必需品就上涨；农闲时，农民经营的手工业副业要出卖其生产品，换回粮食时，粮价又大涨。投机商人抓住农民小生产者资金少、生产力低的弱点，进行囤积居奇，投机取巧，图获厚利。越贫苦的，积蓄越少，受害越大，遇有灾荒时，就受害更加大了。这就必须大量发展供销合作社，与公营商店有计划地收购与推销成品，并供给其生产资料与日用必需品，以免投机商人的严重剥削。如果不加强供销合作社及公营商店的作用，有计划地解决供销，调剂利润（掌握市价），分散的小生产者就很难得到发展。
    因此，我们必需加强生产领导的计划性与组织工作，克服盲目性，才能使农民不受损失，增加其收入，启发其积极性以提高生产。（⑴⑵）
    要有效地提高农业生产，还必须解决水利、牧畜、林木、种籽等一连串的问题。
    我们过去在水利建设上是有很大成绩的，只原晋察冀解放区，十年内就增加水田三百多万亩（相当于现有水地的一半以上）。明后两年再有计划的有组织的开渠，就可增加一五○——二○○万亩水地，今年如准备好，明年一年就可增加一百万亩水地。
    在水车水井事业上，今年我们在平汉线石家庄以北，成立了水利推进社，作了三个月的试验，已修好旧水车四千多辆，增加新水车一千多辆。每辆水车可浇地三十亩左右，因此而增产的粮食量将超过该地区公粮负担量。同时并扶植了二十七个铁工厂、八十六个铁匠炉，实现了把贷款全部用于生产，作到了百分之百的折实保本，而且积累了资金。如果有计划的组织全华北的小铁木工厂、铁匠炉，修理制造水车及农民打井，则两三年内可将全部旧水车修好。在一九四九年可以修复半数，并增加新水车一万二千辆，即可增加水田三十万亩，连修复旧水车，浇地可达一百万亩（每亩增产最低一市石即增产一百万石）。
    我区牲口很缺乏，据北岳、冀中十四县二十三村的典型调查，较战前减少百分之五十，太行许多县区的调查估计也是减少一半。这是恢复与发展农业的重大问题，除从外区购买补充一些外，主要的依靠我们自己的繁殖，而我区又有广大的山川草原，过去有繁殖习惯的约三十余县，仅北岳以繁殖牲口为业的约有三百多村，二万五千多户，如把这些村户的力量发动起来，一九四九年就可增加八万头以上，一九五○年又可多增加一倍，这样，全区牲口在几年内就可恢复战前水平。
    华北的林木也是很缺乏的，将来进行大规模的交通工业建设时，将感到很大的困难，而植树造林，是农民很大的收入，而且有很多的好处，如减少水患防风防沙等。我区面积以半以上为山地，可耕地不及一半，山西部分不及三分之一。这样山地是适合造林的广大地区，只要我们解决了保护管理问题，就可以发展起来。除山地外，我区沙荒约有一百六十万亩，而且每年扩大，压毁良田。农民苦于风沙，筑墙阻防。如果我们能有计划的组织群众造林，在五六年中能消灭四五十万亩沙荒，成为森林防护地带，不但保护了耕地免于风沙之害，而其收入还大于一般旱地的庄稼，费工却少；这就等于农民增加了四五十万亩良田。
    在改良种籽上，我们已有小麦谷子、红薯等项作物的优良品种，只唐河沿岸的稻滩，用同样的耕作法及肥料，优良稻种普遍运用就可增产一万石。临清农场经过三年的试验比较，同样土地与耕作法，一般棉花每亩产七八十斤，好棉种则可产三百斤左右，如果我们有计划有组织的进行种籽改良，增加产量将很可观。
    这只是从几个专门事业的增产上，说明加强计划性与组织工作的重要性。全区性的全面问题还是在于正确地解决土改遗留的问题，扫除生产障碍，农民在积极要求发家致富下组织起来，精耕细作，在发土地证后确定产权，动员农民爱护地权，修整耕地消灭熟荒。如能在两三年内恢复战前耕作水平，耕二（三）锄三（四），把使用得太疲乏的地力恢复起来，增加肥料五分之一到三分之一，则华北全区两年内增产十分之一，即作到毛主席“把生产提高一寸”的号召。如继续发展三四年，经过全体人民的努力，即可争取达到战前水平。
    组织生产的另一面是防止灾荒。华北区十年九旱，而且常闹水灾、虫灾及风雹冻等灾害，每年损失很大，少则百万石，多则千万石。目前我们还不可能彻底消灭灾荒，但也不应当放松可能的措施，对旱灾水灾，如有计划的兴修水利，在上游造保安林，与放淤减少洪水为患，下游筑堤泄水及事先防范的准备工作，就可以在一定地区减少其严重性。
    在好发生虫灾病灾的地区，亦应有计划地预防，如普遍的秋耕除杂草，预见要发生前的诱杀蛾子，初发生时的及时捕打不使蔓延。对于病害的换种选种浸种等，特别是组织筹划重要的杀虫有效的药剂。
    对于风雹冻灾，也可以逐渐地改造种植条件或适应的作物，如造林以防砂，改种作物以防冷冻霜雹等。
    总之，能有计划地进行组织工作，就可以防范于未然，发生灾害也可以及时的阻止，至少减轻其灾害，以保护农民一年劳动的果实少受损失，减轻与克服灾害的威胁，实际即增加了收成。
    虽然一般农民对生产都有个盘算，“打算不到就受穷”，但小农经济本身是盲目性很严重的。因此，我们必需给以尽可能的推动与援助，动员与组织合作互助，（当前尤其是组织供销合作社）给以贷款与技术的指导，这就需要有各地区领导生产的计划以至全华北的计划。
    要想作出一定时期的生产计划，就必需进行深入的调查研究。农业部门必需抽出力量专作这一工作。同时我们有了几年开展大生产的经验，去年秋冬及今年秋冬土改、民主整党中几乎全体干部下了乡，对农村有了更进一步的了解。因此，以县为单位先进行村的调查，并帮助村作出计划，有了县、村的计划就能作出各区的以至全华北的计划了。
    计划拟定之后，必须认真的进行组织工作，配备适当的力量，除了组织全体的力量及适当的分工外，还要建立专门的组织，如为了开展水利，需要组织水利推进社一类的组织，为了繁殖牲畜与植树造林，需要在一定地区设立林牧局。畜养管理处，造林合作社，推进社等一类组织，为了改良农业技术，需要设立农场一类的组织，为了解决广大小生产者生产品的销路及解决其工具原料必需品的供给，需要成立与加强合作社等。
    当然，我们要想把生产提高一步，必需党政民的全体动员，并把全体干部组织起来，但各项专门事业必须有专业的组织，并进行严格的督促检查，随时修正计划中的某些不适当的地方，才能保证其实现。
