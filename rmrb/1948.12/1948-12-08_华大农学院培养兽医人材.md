　　Huada Agricultural College
  　Cultivating Veterinary Talent
    [Our Newspaper] The Agricultural College of North China University is actively cultivating veterinary talent. Since the War of Resistance, due to the brutal plunder of the Japanese invaders and the Kuomintang bandit troops, the number of draught animals has been greatly reduced. However, among the existing draught animals, illnesses often occur due to the masses' improper feeding and overwork of the livestock. After livestock get sick, the masses generally use methods such as smoking them with worn shoes, feeding them bark of the Chinese Toon tree, and cutting the "bone eye," etc. These methods sometimes not only fail to cure the disease but also pose a danger of death.
    In order to reduce livestock mortality, the Agricultural College of North China University established a veterinary practice hospital in June of last year to specialize in training veterinary talent and reforming old veterinarians. Since June of last year, it has opened two veterinary specialist classes and a short-term training class. The two specialist classes are now going to various veterinary work stations for internships, personally treating illnesses, and at the same time improving the students' skills. Currently, the college has established eighteen veterinary internship work stations in various regions. According to August statistics: a total of more than 2,200 head of livestock have been successfully treated, of which one-third were severe cases. (Kong Wen, Gui Fang, Zhi He, Shu Ben)

　　华大农学院
  　培养兽医人材
    【本报讯】华北大学农学院积极培养兽医人材。自抗战以来，由于日寇和国民党匪军的残暴掠夺，使耕畜大大减少。但在这现有的耕畜中，因群众对牲畜喂养不调，使用过度，往往发生病症。牲畜得病后，群众普通都用破鞋薰或吃椿树皮及割骨眼等法，这些办法，有时不但治不了病，反而有死亡的危险。
    华北大学农学院为了减少牲畜的死亡，从去年六月间即设立实习兽医院，专门培养兽医人材，及改造旧兽医。从去年六月间到现在，已开办了两个兽医专修班，及一个短期训练班，现两专修班均分赴各兽医工作站实习，亲自看病，同时又提高了学生们的技术。目前该院在各地所设之兽医实习工作站已有十八个，据八月份统计：共看好了牲口两千二百余头，其中重病占三分之一。（孔文、贵芳、致和、树本）
