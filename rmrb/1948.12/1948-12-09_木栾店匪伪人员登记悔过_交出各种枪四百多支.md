　　Mulandiang Bandit and Puppet Personnel Register and Repent
  　Surrender More Than 400 Various Guns
    [Taihang News] After Mulandiang (Xincheng in Wuzhi) was liberated by us on October 25th, after widely explaining current affairs and publicizing our Party's lenient policy, the bandit and puppet personnel have registered with our democratic government one after another, determined to repent and start anew, and become new people. Si Ma, Chen Kelian, said: "From now on, I am determined to be a good person. I have two guns, let's hand them over to the government!" Yun Longzhang from Nanguanzhuang said: "The Kuomintang is selling out the country and harming the people, only planning for their own interests." Zhang Changde cried and said: "Because I worked for the miscellaneous army (referring to the Jiang bandits), my old wife also died of hardship. If I had known it would be like this (referring to the Jiang bandits being bad and the People's Liberation Army being good), who would have done it?" Many bandit and puppet personnel voluntarily exposed their mistakes and were determined to atone for their crimes. According to incomplete statistics, within half a month, 856 bandit officers and soldiers registered with the democratic government, handing over 4 machine guns, 412 rifles, more than 3,200 rounds of ammunition, as well as artillery shells, telephones, and other items.

　　木栾店匪伪人员登记悔过
  　交出各种枪四百多支
    【太行讯】木栾店（武陟的新城）于十月二十五日为我解放后，经过广泛讲解时事与宣传我党宽大政策后，匪伪人员，纷纷向我民主政府进行登记，决心悔过自新，重新作人。司马出陈克连说：“今后决心当个好人。我有两支枪交给政府吧！”南官庄云龙章说：“国民党是卖国害民的，光是为自己利益打算。”张长德哭着说：“我因干杂牌军（指蒋匪），老妻也困死了，早知是这样（指蒋匪不好，解放军好），谁还干？”不少匪伪人员自动揭发错误，决心立功赎罪。据不完全统计，在半个月内，向民主政府登记匪军官兵八百五十六人，交出机枪四挺，步枪四百一十二支，子弹三千二百余发，还有炮弹、电话机及其他物品一部。
