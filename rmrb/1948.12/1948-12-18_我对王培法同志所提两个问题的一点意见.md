　　A Few Comments on Comrade Wang Peifa's Two Questions
    Lan Cun
    My understanding of the questions raised by the Qin County Party Committee is as follows:
    (1) Restoring the civil rights of landlords and rich peasants is not a general proposal for all liberated areas, but only necessary in areas where land reform has been thoroughly completed. In areas where land reform has been thoroughly completed, the land and property of landlords and rich peasants have been confiscated or requisitioned and distributed, the economic foundation of the feudal class has been completely destroyed, and landlords and rich peasants no longer exist as a class. In the old and semi-old liberated areas of North China, after many years of rent reduction and interest rate reduction, anti-traitor liquidation, and land reform movements, the landlord and rich peasant classes have long changed, and most of them have now been transformed or are being transformed into the laboring people. Those landlords and rich peasants who have not yet changed their status exist today only as individuals. As long as they support the new democratic regime and abide by government laws, restoring their civil rights is permissible. This can stabilize them and lead them to the path of the laboring people, which is beneficial to the development of production. If individual members of these landlords and rich peasants have transformed well, progressed rapidly, are supported by the masses, and are elected to participate in the work of the people's government, this has no impact on the nature of the new democratic regime of the people's democratic dictatorship led by the proletariat, because they are no longer representing the landlord class in participating in the government. Moreover, after granting them civil rights, if individual speculative landlords and rich peasants still stand on the feudal landlord and rich peasant position to oppose the new democratic regime or the people's cause, their civil rights can still be deprived and revoked after legal judgment.
    (2) In Comrade Bo Yibo's report on the North China Administrative Policy, the issue of burdens only mentioned that "the government should strive to save manpower and material resources, not increase the burden on the people, and the agricultural tax should not exceed 20% of the average total agricultural income of the entire region"; it did not say that "the burden should be reduced." The Qinyang County Party Committee's propaganda to the masses below that "the burden will be reduced" in the future is due to not carefully reading Comrade Yibo's report, and there is no contradiction between the Party's political leadership and actual policies. In fact, as long as we consider the current situation - the People's Liberation War is developing rapidly, and the Kuomintang reactionary regime will be fundamentally defeated in about a year, while the North China Liberated Area is engaged in large-scale production and construction, under the premise that everything is for the early victory of the revolutionary war, it is easy to understand that the statement of "reducing the burden on the people" is impractical and impossible. However, is it absolutely impossible to reduce the burden on the people? If we only passively focus on the amount of public grain to be collected, we must complete the tasks stipulated by the higher authorities, and it is impossible to reduce it. But if we can look at it from a positive perspective, as Comrade Yibo pointed out in the North China Administrative Policy: "On the positive side, the government should advocate organizing farmers' production and consumption cooperation and mutual assistance, encourage agricultural technology improvement and rural sideline occupations, and issue agricultural loans to help farmers' production." That is, using various methods to organize and lead the masses to engage in production to increase the income of the masses, the burden can be relatively reduced, and the people's lives can be improved considerably. For example, the masses in Renzhuang Village, Licheng County, Taihang District, have organized to engage in production and plan to earn back all the public grain paid by the village within a month (see the People's Daily, second page, second day of this month). The common people have learned from the correct political leadership of the Party and their own experience that "if you want to reduce the burden, you must work hard to produce" (see the same article above). All enlightened people believe in and enthusiastically support the Party's policies. They understand that fundamentally defeating the Kuomintang's reactionary rule means their descendants will be permanently liberated and will never again be oppressed and exploited by imperialists, feudal landlords, and bureaucratic capitalists. For the victory of the war, they would rather save on food and clothing and pay more public grain to support the front. For example, Taihang labor hero Shi Cunjin, when setting his three-year wealth plan, proposed "Eat more chaff and vegetables this winter, and strive to pay more public grain to support the war and completely overthrow the reactionary government of Chiang Kai-shek." This is a concrete example of the people recognizing the benefits of the land reform and the People's Liberation War led by the Party for them through their own personal experiences, and thus resolutely supporting the Party's policies. I think that our comrades who are engaged in leadership work, without carefully studying the Party's policies, and unable to use good propaganda and education work to improve the awareness of the general masses with poor understanding, and following them to doubt the Party's policies, reducing themselves to the status of unenlightened common people, is very inappropriate. As for whether the specific amount of public grain collected in Qinyang and the actual output of farmers are inappropriate, the Qinyang County Party Committee should ask the higher-level government to review and study it.

### 我对王培法同志所提两个问题的一点意见

　　我对王培法同志所提两个问题的一点意见
    蓝村
    沁县县委会提出的几个问题，我是这样认识的：
    （一）恢复地主、富农的公民权，并不是所有解放区一般地提出，而只是土地改革业已彻底完成的地区有此必要。在土改已经彻底完成的地区，地主、富农的土地财产已被没收或征收分配，封建阶级的经济基础已被彻底打垮，地主、富农之作为阶级已不存在。如华北解放区的老区半老区，经过许多年来减租减息、反奸清算以至土地改革的各次运动，地、富阶级早已发生变化，现在大部分已经转变或正在转变成为劳动人民。那些尚未转变成份的地主富农，今天只是作为地主富农的个人而存在。只要他们拥护新民主主义政权，遵守政府法令，恢复其公民权是可以的。这样可以使他安定下来，走向劳动人民的道路，对于发展生产是有好处的。这些地主富农中的个别分子，如转变很好，进步很快，为人民大众所拥护，被选举参加人民的政府工作，这对于无产阶级领导的人民民主专政的新民主主义政权性质没有影响，因为他已不是代表地主阶级来参加政权。而且，在给予他们公民权以后，如个别投机的地、富分子仍然站在封建地、富立场来反对新民主主义的政权或人民事业，经法律判决，其公民权仍然可以剥夺收回。
    （二）薄一波同志在华北施政方针的报告中，对于负担问题只谈到“政府应当竭力节约使用民力，不加重人民负担，农业税额应当不超过全区农业平均总收入的百分之二十”；没有说过“负担要减轻”。沁阳县委在下边给群众宣传今后“负担要减轻”是由于对一波同志的报告没有认真阅读，而不是党的政治领导与实际政策有任何矛盾之处。其实，只要我们考虑一下目前形势——人民解放战争正日益迅速发展，一年左右要将国民党反动政权根本打垮，同时华北解放区正从事大规模的生产建设，在一切为了革命战争早日胜利的前提之下，“减轻人民负担”的提法之不切合实际与不可能是很容易明白的。但是，减轻人民的负担是不是绝对不可能呢？假如仅是　消极地从征收公粮的数量着眼，那必须完成上级所规定的任务，是不可能减轻的。但假如我们能从积极方面去看，如一波同志在华北施政方针中所指示的：“政府在积极方面，应当提倡组织农民的生产和消费的合作互助，奖励农业的技术改良和农村副业，发放帮助农民生产的农业贷款。”即用各种办法去组织领导群众进行生产，以增加群众的收入，则负担是可以相对减轻的，人民的生活也可以得到相当改善。如太行区黎城仁庄村群众已组织起来搞生产，计划一个月内即赚回全村所交纳的公粮（见人民日报本月二日二版消息）。老百姓在党的正确的政治领导及其自身的经验当中了解到“想要减轻负担，必须努力生产”（见上面同条消息）。一切有了觉悟的人民，他们是相信并热烈拥护党的政策的，他们了解根本打垮国民党的反动统治，是他们子孙万代的永久翻身，永远不再受帝国主义封建地主及官僚资本家的压迫剥削。为了战争的胜利，他们宁愿节衣缩食多交公粮，支援前线。如太行劳动英雄石寸金，在订三年发家计划的时候，他就提出“今冬多掺糠菜吃，争取多交公粮支援战争，彻底打倒蒋介石反动政府。”这就是人民在自己的切身经历中认识了党所领导的土地改革及人民解放战争对他们的好处，因而他们坚决拥护党的政策的具体例证。我觉得我们做领导工作的同志，不细心研究党的政策，不能用很好的宣传教育工作将一般认识较差的群众提高其觉悟程度，也跟在他们后面对党的政策发生怀疑，把自己降低到不觉悟的老百姓的地位，这是很不应当的。至于沁阳的公粮具体的征收数量与农民的实际产量是否有不合适之处，沁阳县委最好请示上级政府审查研究。
