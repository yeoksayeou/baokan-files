Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 8th: Under the lenient policy of the People's Government, personnel from reactionary organizations in Zhengzhou City have been registering with public security organs one after another. From October 25th to November 24th, the number of registered individuals reached 441. Among them were 163 Kuomintang members, 13 members of the Three People's Principles Youth League, and one member of the China Youth Party. The surrendered weapons included 20 rifles, 8 pistols, 6,000 rounds of ammunition, 60 artillery shells, 259 grenades, and 4 boxes of rifle grenades. 196 people turned in various important documents. The registered individuals belonged to puppet Fang's military and political organs, including the Chiang Kai-shek bandit's Zhengzhou Command Garrison Headquarters, the 12th Pacification Zone, the 25th Officer Corps of the Ministry of National Defense, the Inspection Department of the Zhengzhou Garrison Command, the Criminal Police Team, the Security Defense Team, the Plainclothes Team, the puppet Henan First Commissioner's Office, and the puppet Zheng County, Xinzheng, Yu County, Huojia, Linru, Xinxiang and other county governments and county party departments. Among the registered were Chiang Kai-shek's retired general-level officers Jia Zhensheng, former deputy commander of the 179th Division of the 33rd Group Army, Cui Jinhai, deputy commander of the 44th Division, Zhang Dongshan, former deputy commander of the Zhengzhou Security Force, Chen Xiaoshan, former intelligence team leader of the 4th Group Army, colonel regiment commander of the 9th Regiment of the Bandit Hebei-Shandong-Henan Security First Brigade, Wang Hanjie, puppet Yu County magistrate, Shi Qingyun, who once served as puppet Linzhang County magistrate, Shang Guojun, deputy secretary-general of the Kuomintang Xinzheng County Party Department, Zhang Zhengyi, preparatory committee member of the Linru Three People's Principles Youth League branch, and Cao Ying, chairman of the China Youth Party Xinzheng Committee.
    
Xinhua News Agency, Luoyang, 6th: The work of registering personnel from reactionary organizations such as the Kuomintang and the Three People's Principles Youth League in Luoyang City has been greatly accelerated due to the victory of the People's Liberation Army, especially the liberation of Zhengzhou, Kaifeng, Nanyang, and Xuzhou. Seeing that the Kuomintang reactionaries were losing ground, these personnel from reactionary organizations repented and renewed themselves one after another. In the fourteen days from November 7th to 19th alone, 324 people, including the puppet Public Security Bureau Chief, puppet District Chief, and Three People's Principles Youth League squad leader, went to the People's Public Security Organs to register their repentance and surrender their party cards, documents, weapons, and telecommunications equipment. Kou Xianhua, a former second lieutenant radio operator of the New Fifth Army, had just returned home from Zhengzhou this time and was persuaded by his mother to hand over the radio telegraph machine and generator that the Kuomintang army had deposited in his home to the People's Government, register, and announce his withdrawal from the Kuomintang reactionary organization. The wife of Gao Linxiang, the puppet deputy town chief of Wenli Town, after handing over a pistol hidden in her home, also asked her cousin to go to Shanzhou to bring her husband back for registration. Ma Cisan, the puppet deputy town chief, fled to Zhengzhou when Luoyang was restored due to being deceived by the Kuomintang's propaganda, and only returned this time when Zhengzhou was liberated. After personally experiencing the People's Government's lenient policy of "the ringleaders will be punished, the coerced will not be questioned, and those who perform meritorious service will be rewarded," he was extremely moved. In addition to registering himself, he also persuaded Kuomintang member Zhao Zijun to register with the People's Government. After registering, Guo Mingke of District One went home and brought his son Guo Wenyu to the government to repent, vowing to break away from the Kuomintang reactionary organization and become a good citizen again. The city's work of registering personnel from puppet organizations is continuing. The Luoyang Municipal People's Government announced on November 20th: In order to give personnel from reactionary organizations such as the Kuomintang and the Three People's Principles Youth League an opportunity to repent and renew themselves, the registration work will be extended to the end of December of this year. Those who fail to register after the deadline will be dealt with according to the law.
