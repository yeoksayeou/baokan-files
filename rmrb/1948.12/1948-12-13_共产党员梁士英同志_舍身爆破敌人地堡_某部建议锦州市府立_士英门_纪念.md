Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 10th: The heroic deed of Communist Party member Liang Shiying, who sacrificed himself to complete a demolition mission, is a model of revolutionary heroism. On October 13th, when the Northeast Field Army launched a general attack on the enemy defending Jinzhou, the 10th Company of a certain regiment of the "Siping" unit was ordered to undertake the breakthrough mission. Liang Shiying, a soldier of the fifth squad of the company, was the first to climb the city wall and single-handedly repelled a fierce counterattack by an enemy force of more than a company with hand grenades. He encouraged his comrades, saying, "Don't be afraid of the enemy's counterattack; as long as we have hand grenades, we can solve them." Later, when the company was pursuing and annihilating the enemy and passing through the second railway line, the road was suddenly blocked by a barrage of fire from two heavy machine guns in a bunker beside the road. The troops had difficulty advancing for a time. At this critical moment, Liang Shiying, holding a demolition charge, rushed through the enemy's fire and ran to the front of the bunker. He quickly stuffed the demolition charge into the gun hole of the bunker. But when he pulled the fuse and quickly retreated, the enemy pushed the demolition charge out. Liang Shiying turned around, ran back immediately, stuffed the already smoking demolition charge back into the gun hole of the bunker, and held it with both hands to prevent the enemy from pushing it out again. A certain platoon leader of the company saw this critical situation and quickly shouted, "Liang Shiying, come back quickly!" But he loudly replied, "I can't go back; if I go back, I won't be able to complete the mission!" Before he finished speaking, with a loud bang, the bunker collapsed, the obstacle to the troops' advance was removed, and Comrade Liang Shiying also heroically sacrificed his life. After the battle, the news spread quickly. All the comrades in the unit mourned his loss with deep sorrow. In addition to recording three major merits for Comrade Liang Shiying, the unit has suggested to the Jinzhou Municipal People's Government that the northwest gate of Jinzhou be named "Shiying Gate" to commemorate him. Comrade Liang Shiying was a Communist Party member, from Yu County, Nenjiang Province, and came from a poor peasant family. After the "August 15th" surrender of the Japanese invaders in 1945, he joined the Northeast People's Liberation Army.

    共产党员梁士英同志
    舍身爆破敌人地堡
    某部建议锦州市府立“士英门”纪念
    【新华社东北十日电】共产党员梁士英舍身完成爆破任务的英勇事迹，是革命英雄主义的一个模范。十月十三日东北野战军对锦州守敌发起总攻时，命令“四平”部某团十连担任突破任务。该连五班战士梁士英首先登城，一个人用手榴弹击退了敌人一连以上兵力的猛烈反击。他鼓励全班同志说：“不怕敌人反击，只要有手榴弹就能解决他们。”后来当该连追歼敌人通过第二道铁路时，路旁一个地堡内敌人两挺重机枪的火网突然封锁了道路。部队一时难以前进。梁士英在此紧急关头，拿着爆破筒冲过敌人的火网，飞跑到地堡跟前，敏捷地把爆破筒塞进地堡的枪眼。但当他拉了导火线迅速退回时，敌人却将爆破筒推出来了。梁士英回头一看，立刻跑回去，把已在冒烟的爆破筒重新塞进地堡枪眼，并用双手抵住，不让敌人再推出来。该连某排长看见这种危急情形，连忙高喊：“梁士英，赶快回来！”但他却大声回答说：“不能回去，回去就不能完成任务了！”话声未落，轰然一声，地堡炸塌，部队冲锋前进的障碍立被扫除，梁士英同志也同时壮烈捐躯。战斗结束后，这一消息便迅速传出。该部全体同志闻讯莫不悼念痛惜。该部现除为梁士英同志记三大功外，并向锦州市民主政府建议：将锦州西北门命名为“士英门”，以志不忘。梁士英同志是共产党员，嫩江省余县人，贫农出身。一九四五年“八一五”日寇投降后，参加东北人民解放军。
