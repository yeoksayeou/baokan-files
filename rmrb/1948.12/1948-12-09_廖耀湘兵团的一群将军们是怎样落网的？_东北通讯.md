　　How a Group of Generals from the Liao Yaoxiang Corps Were Captured?
　　——Northeast Correspondence

　　At dawn on October 28th, the engineering company directly under a unit of the People's Liberation Army, responsible for guarding the southeast corner of the Dahushan battlefield in western Liaoning, discovered eight Kuomintang soldiers emerging from the bushes across from them in a panic. A squad from the company immediately rushed forward and shouted "Halt!" The opponents were so frightened that they hurriedly raised their hands. One of them stammered, "I am an officer, I am an officer." The soldiers searched them and found that they were all carrying Canadian pistols, and one of them also had a detailed map and some documents.

　　They were taken to the company headquarters, and a liberated soldier recognized the officer carrying the map and documents as Zheng Tingji, the commander of the enemy's 49th Army. Another who claimed "I am an officer" was Luo Cuqiu, the commander of the enemy's 195th Division. Zheng and Luo could not deny it and had to admit it.

　　On October 28th, the battle of annihilation at Dahushan was in progress. A group of defeated enemies fled from the direction of Jiangtun, desperately escaping towards Xinmin through the mountains and fields. A certain company of our pursuing troops captured nearly a hundred prisoners at that time. During the assembly, a soldier in the prisoner group suddenly exclaimed in a low voice: "Oh dear! The division commander has also been captured!" This sentence was heard by a soldier of our army, who immediately stepped forward and asked: "Which division are you from? Which one is the division commander?" The man refused to answer. After the soldier repeatedly explained our army's lenient policy, he said: "We are from the 22nd Division of the New 6th Army. The one without a hat in front is our division commander, Luo Ying." Our army soldiers immediately reported this to the instructor, who went to inquire. Luo Ying still stubbornly argued: "I am not the division commander, I am an adjutant." The instructor explained again: "If you are the division commander, just admit it, we guarantee your safety! Don't be afraid!" But Luo Ying still did not admit it. Later, when the camp instructor took him to inquire, he kept saying: "I am an adjutant, not the division commander." Finally, the captured soldier went to persuade him: "If you are not our division commander Luo Ying, who are you? Admit it, the People's Liberation Army will be lenient towards you." Luo Ying's face immediately turned pale, and he lowered his head without saying a word.

　　Yang Kun, the chief of staff of the Liao Yaoxiang Corps, was captured by Wang Jun, a young soldier of our army. At noon on November 15th, Wang Jun was standing guard at the entrance of the regiment department when suddenly two people came from outside the village. One of them, a fat man about forty years old, was wearing short, small, and tattered clothes, and a yellow felt hat that could barely cover the top of his head. Wang Jun immediately stepped forward to inquire. The fat man replied in a Hunan accent: "I am a clerk liberated from Jinzhou, and he is a sergeant. We are going back to Guanli." Later, the fat man took out a "Liberation Certificate" written in black characters on red paper and stamped with a large official seal, attempting to deceive them. However, the clever Wang Jun, after looking at his fat face, suddenly remembered that there was a photo of an enemy officer in that pictorial that looked exactly like this person. Therefore, Wang Jun, regardless of how the fat man argued, took him to the superior authorities. During the interrogation, although the fat man repeatedly changed his story, sometimes saying he was a "clerk" and sometimes a "businessman," he finally had no words to answer and had to admit that he was Yang Kun.

　　Yang is from Shaoyang, Hunan, and is forty-four years old. When reporters saw him at a certain front-line headquarters, he said: "After our troops were defeated by your army, I had no choice but to crawl into a sorghum field alone. I didn't eat or drink for a day and a night. Later, I was so hungry that I crawled out, and with great difficulty, I found a set of civilian clothes. Then I met a sergeant from our corps headquarters, and I asked him to go back to Shenyang with me. On the way, I heard that Shenyang had already been liberated by your army. There was no way to go back, so I had to turn back. Before I even got to Heishan, I was stopped by your little brother." (Xinhua News Agency, Northeast Front, 4th)

　　廖耀湘兵团的一群将军们是怎样落网的？
    ——东北通讯
    十月二十八日拂晓，在辽西打虎山战场东南角担任警戒的解放军某部直属工兵连，发现从对面树丛里，慌慌张张地走出来八个国民党军，该连一个班立即飞也似的围上去，大喊“站住”，对方吓得慌忙都把手举起来，其中一个战战兢兢地说：“我是个官，我是个官。”战士们向他们进行搜查，发现他们身上都带着加拿大手枪，其中有一个还带着一张详细地图及一些文件。
    他们被带到连部，一个解放战士认出了那个带着地图和文件的军官，就是敌四十九军军长郑庭笈，另外一个自称“我是个官”的，便是敌一九五师师长罗萃求。郑罗无法抵赖，只得承认了。
    十月二十八日打虎山围歼战正在进行，由姜屯方向逃出一股狼狈的敌人，慌不择路地从山野里向新民方向逃跑。我追击部队某连当时即捉到近百名俘虏。集合的时候，俘虏群中一个当兵的突然低声惊叫：“啊呀！师长也被捉住了！”这句话被我军一个战士听到，他立即向前询问；“你是那一师的？那个是师长？”那人不肯答复。经这个战士再三说明我军的宽大政策后，他说道：“我们是新六军新二十二师的，前面那个没戴帽子的就是我们师长罗英。”我军战士马上将此事报告指导员，指导员前去查问，罗英还强辩说：“我不是师长，我是副官。”指导员又解释说：“你是师长，你就承认吧，我们保证你的生命安全！不用害怕！”但罗英还是不承认。后来营教导员将他带去查问时，他还老是说：“我是副官，不是师长。”最后那个俘虏兵前去劝他说：“你不是我们的师长罗英是谁？承认吧，承认了解放军会宽大对你。”罗英的面色立即变的灰白，低下头一句话也不说了。
    廖耀湘兵团参谋长杨昆是被我军某部小战士王俊捉住的。十一月十五日正午，小王俊正在团部门口站岗，突然从屯（村）子外面走来两个人，其中一个年约四十余岁的胖子穿着又短又小的破衣，一顶黄色毡帽也只能盖着头顶。王俊立刻上前查问，胖子用湖南腔答道：“我是锦州解放的文书，他是上士，我们要回关里去。”以后胖子又拿出红纸上写着黑字，盖有大公章的“解放证”来，企图蒙混过去。但聪明的小王俊看了他的胖脸后，忽然想起曾在那本画册上有一敌军官的照片和此人一模一样，于是王俊不管胖子怎样狡辩，便把他带交上级机关去了。在审讯中，胖子虽一再改口，一会说是“文书”，一会又说是“商人”，但最后终于无言对答，不得不承认是杨昆。
    杨是湖南邵阳人，四十四岁。当记者在前线某指挥所看见他时，他说：“我们的部队被贵军打垮后，我一个人没法只得钻进一个秫秸地里，一天一夜没有吃饭喝水。后来实在饿得不行，我才钻出来，好容易才找到了一套便衣，又遇到我们兵团司令部的上士，我就要他和我一路回沈阳。走在路上又听说沈阳早被贵军解放了，没办法只好折回来。还没走到黑山，就被贵军那位小兄弟问住了。”（新华社东北前线四日电）
