　　Utilizing the Agricultural Off-Season to Enhance Culture
　　Northeast Winter Study Movement Unfolds
Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 27th. In order to raise the cultural level of farmers, rural areas throughout the Northeast are now seizing the agricultural off-season to vigorously carry out the Winter Study Movement. The characteristics of this year's Winter Study work in the Northeast are: it is universally and closely integrated with the current movements of grain requisition, Party building, land certificate issuance, and preparation for spring plowing next year; and it is prepared to further develop future social education work on the basis of running Winter Studies well. The main targets of Winter Study education are village cadres, activists, and organized young and middle-aged male and female farmers. The organizational forms and educational methods of Winter Study are not fixed, but are flexibly applied according to the time and place. After the commencement of Winter Studies in various parts of the Northeast, they have been warmly welcomed by the masses of farmers. Since the establishment of the First Central School and six branch schools in the Eleventh District of Longjiang County, Nenjiang Province, there have been more than 460 students, of whom, in addition to more than 100 children, all are village cadres and young and middle-aged men and women. According to preliminary statistics, the eleven Winter Studies in Jixian County, Hejiang Province (newly established county, formerly part of Fujin County) have a total of more than 300 students, the vast majority of whom are male and female cadres in villages. In addition, Winter Studies have also been established in cities such as Harbin and Qiqihar, and counties in Liaoning and Andong provinces. The organization of Winter Studies in various places generally involves dividing students into classes according to their level of education, with classes held for one or two hours each day. Some of the Winter Study teachers are selected from village cadres with higher levels of education, while others are local primary school teachers. Some counties first run Winter Study training classes to train Winter Study teachers. Regarding the enrollment and classes for Winter Study students, Jixian County and other places in Hejiang Province have adopted the following methods: (1) Those who have studied for one or two years are grouped into Group A, learning to read newspapers and write receipts, letters of introduction, etc.; (2) Those who have studied for half a year and have a slight knowledge of characters are grouped into Group B, focusing on literacy; (3) Illiterate people are grouped into Group C, listening to lectures while learning to write characters with few strokes and short sentences. Primary school teachers in various parts of Northeast China have played a significant role in carrying out this year's Winter Study Movement. For example, primary school teachers in Fuyu County, Nenjiang Province, organized the Jiaolian Amateur Troupe to perform plays such as "Evaluating Work and Recording Accounts," "Who Does Labor Belong To," and "Attending Winter Study" in various villages to mobilize farmers to enroll. After the commencement of Winter Studies in various parts of the Northeast, preliminary results have now been achieved. For example, students at the Sha District Winter Study in Jixian County, Hejiang Province, have learned to use the abacus after studying for more than 20 days. People with a higher level of education can read popular farmer's newspapers and write ordinary receipts and letters of introduction.

　　利用农闲提高文化
  　东北冬学运动展开
    【新华社沈阳二十七日电】为了提高农民的文化水平，东北各地农村现正抓紧农闲时间开展冬学运动。今年东北冬学工作的特点是：普遍与当前的征粮、建党和发土地证和准备明年春耕运动密切结合；并准备从办好冬学的基础上，进一步开展今后的社会教育工作。冬学教育的主要对象是村屯干部、积极分子和有组织的青壮年男女农民。冬学的组织形式和教育方法并不固定，依时间、地点的不同而灵活运用。东北各地冬学开课后，受到农民群众的热烈欢迎。嫩江省龙江县十一区自开办第一中心学校和六个分校之后，已有学生四百六十余名，其中除一百余名儿童外，都为村屯干部及男女青壮年。合江省集贤县（新设县，原富锦县之一部）的十一所冬学，据初步统计共有三百余人上学，学生绝大多数为村屯男女干部。此外，如哈尔滨、齐齐哈尔等城市和辽宁、安东等省各县，也都创办了冬学。各地冬学的编制，一般是按照学生的文化程度分别编班，每天上课一小时或两小时。冬学的教员，一部分由文化程度较高的村屯干部中推选担任，一部分则由当地小学教员担任。有些县份事先开办冬学训练班，训练冬学师资。关于冬学学生编班上课，合江省集贤县等地采取以下的办法：（一）念过一两年书的编为甲组，学习读报，写收据、介绍信等；（二）念过半年书及略为认识字的编为乙组，着重识字；（三）文盲编为丙组，一面听讲，一面学写笔划少的字和短句。东北各地小学教员，在开展今年冬学运动中起了很大的作用。如嫩江省扶余县的小学教师，曾组织了教联业余剧团，到各村演出“评工记帐”、“劳动归谁”、“上冬学”等剧本，动员农民群众入学。东北各地冬学开课后，现已收到初步效果。如合江省集贤县沙区冬学的学生，在学习二十多天以后，即有不少人学会了算盘。程度较高的人能看通俗的庄稼人报，写普通的收据和介绍信。
