　　Deep Ploughing, Fine Harrowing, and Increased Fertilizer
  　North China Completes Wheat Planting
    [This newspaper's special dispatch] North China has victoriously completed the wheat planting task. Throughout the region, except for Taihang and Taiyue, where planting is less due to mountainous climate and soil conditions, the planting area generally exceeds the original plan, and many areas have exceeded last year's, achieving deep ploughing, fine harrowing, and a significant increase in fertilizer application. According to statistics from various regions: In southern Hebei, the wheat planting area accounts for 50% to 60% of the total cultivated land, with a total of 14,321,197 mu planted in the entire region, exceeding last year's 10,761,286 mu by 11.62%. In the eight counties of Huolu and Jingxing in the North Yue area, wheat planting accounts for 30%, exceeding last year's 9% and exceeding this year's plan by 2.5%. In the nine counties of Gaoping and Lingshi in the Taiyue area, it exceeds last year's by 3.8% to 6.5%. In the slightly arid areas of central Hebei, 24% is planted, in the areas with even rainfall, 30% is planted, and in the flood-affected areas (around Qingyuan), 70% to 80% is planted. In the general geological areas of Hebei-Shandong-Henan, 70% is planted, slightly lower is 60%, and higher is 85%. In the sandy areas along the Yellow River in counties such as Hexi and Shouzhang, wheat planting is less, but it still reaches 20% to 45%. The total area planted in the region exceeds last year's wheat planting area by 10%. The region has also dredged a large amount of water (more than 300,000 mu) and eliminated wasteland (470,000 mu), greatly increasing the wheat planting area.
    During cultivation, the masses' enthusiasm was extremely high. Most wheat fields were ploughed and harrowed. In Hebei-Shandong-Henan, some land that had not been ploughed for two years due to the devastation by the Chiang bandits was ploughed and harrowed this year.
    The amount of fertilizer applied has also increased significantly compared to last year. According to a survey in Bafang Village, Anguo, central Hebei, 1.7 carts of fertilizer were applied per mu. In Ganzhuang Village, Jin County, 95 out of 185 households applied soybean cake. Peasant Feng Heizi, who had turned over, turned two shi of harvested soybeans into soybean cake, and also exchanged 100 jin of newly picked cotton for 100 jin of soybean cake, applying them all to six mu of wheat fields. Taking the survey of Dongqizhai, Huaxian County, in the southwestern part of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan area as an example: Last year, out of 17.61 mu of wheat planted, 7.173 mu were fertilized with grass manure, equivalent to 1.6 large carts per mu, 43 mu were fertilized with soybean cake, equivalent to 32 jin per mu, and 7.149 mu were sparsely planted, accounting for 49% of the total wheat planted area. This year, wheat is planted in the same area, with 7.985 mu fertilized with grass manure, 5.933 mu fertilized with soybean cake, and 4.06 mu sparsely planted, accounting for 30.5% of the total wheat planted area. Calculating 30 jin of soybean cake as equivalent to one cart of manure, the amount of fertilizer applied increased by 68.9% compared to last year. Furthermore, according to a survey of the mutual aid group of Yuan Bingwen in Yangguantun, Fuping County, in the northeastern part of the area, the group applied 1.25 large carts of fertilizer and 44 jin of soybean cake per mu, with the minimum being over 20 jin. In southern Hebei, the application of fertilizer generally increased by one-third to one-half, and in individual areas such as Yuanchao County, it has reached the pre-War of Resistance level of fertilizer application (before the war, it was usually three carts of fertilizer and 30 to 50 jin of soybean cake).
    The basic reasons for achieving the above results are the completion of land reform and the great victory of the People's Liberation War. The former eliminated feudalism and enabled peasants with little or no land to obtain land, and the latter inspired the peasants' victorious mood and created an environment for production and construction. In addition, the correction of certain "leftist" errors in the land reform and party rectification, the determination of land rights, and the implementation of production policies have enabled all strata to concentrate on production. Furthermore, the party committees at all levels grasped the season, earnestly led, labor models took the lead, a large number of full and semi-labor forces were organized, and loans and other assistance were provided, which enabled this year's wheat planting to achieve the above results.
    Therefore, it is not entirely correct to simply attribute this year's production achievements to "correction" or to believe that "more rain means more wheat planting." On the other hand, it is even more wrong to attribute disasters to "long-term war" and "overly leftist policies in land reform." These are all incorrect statements that underestimate the great significance of the completion of land reform and the victory of the People's Liberation War, fail to fully affirm its achievements, and lack understanding of the party and people's united struggle to overcome disasters.
    On the other hand, there are still many shortcomings in the work, such as inadequate planning and forced orders in individual places. For example, the masses in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan area reflected: "It is not good to plant too much wheat, and it should not exceed 65%," because planting too much reduces firewood and fertilizer, and planting is all concentrated in one period, making it too busy. Some people in central Hebei are also unwilling to plant more wheat due to lack of fertilizer. This also shows that in mobilizing wheat planting, some places did not make appropriate plans based on local land, climate, and people's needs.

### 深耕细耙增加肥料　华北各地完成种麦

　　深耕细耙增加肥料
  　华北各地完成种麦
    【本报特讯】华北各地胜利地完成了种麦任务。全区除太行、太岳因山地气候土壤关系播种较少外，其余播种面积一般均超过原计划，不少地区并超过去年，且做到深耕细耙，施肥量也大为增加。据各地统计：冀南种麦面积，占总耕地数的百分之五十到六十，全区种一千四百三十二万一千一百九十七亩，超过去年种的一千零七十六万一千二百八十六亩的百分之十一点六二。北岳获鹿、井陉等八县，种麦占百分之三十，超过去年的百分之九，超过今年计划的百分之二点五。太岳高平、灵石等九县，超过去年的百分之三点八到百分之六点五。冀中稍旱区种百分之二十四，雨匀区种百分之三十，水灾区（清苑一带）种百分之七十到八十。冀鲁豫地质一般的地区，种到百分之七十，稍低的百分之六十，高的则到百分之八十五。河西、寿张等县沿黄河的沙地，种麦较少，但也到百分之二十到四十五。全区总计超过去年种麦面积的百分之十。该区并大量疏水（出地三十余万亩），与消灭荒地（四十七万亩），使种麦面积大大增加。
    在耕作中，群众情绪均极高涨，大部麦地，都经过犁、耙，冀鲁豫有些因蒋匪蹂躏二年没犁过的地，今年统通犁耙了。
    在施肥量上，比去年也有显著的增加：据冀中安国八方村的调查，每亩施肥一点七车，晋县干庄一百八十五户，其中有九十五户施豆饼。翻身农民冯黑子，把收割的二石豆子打成豆饼，又把新摘的棉花一百斤换成一百斤豆饼，一并上在六亩麦田里。冀鲁豫区的西南部的县份，以滑县东起寨的调查为例：去年种麦十七顷六亩一分内，有七顷十七亩三分上草粪、每亩合一点六大车，四十三亩上豆饼，每亩合三十二斤，薄种七顷十四亩九分，占总种麦地数百分之四十九。今年以原地数种麦，则以七顷九十八亩半上草粪，五顷九十三亩三分上豆饼，薄种四顷六分，占总种麦数百分之三十点五，以三十斤豆饼顶一车粪计算，施肥量较去年增加百分之六十八点九。再以该区东北部县份傅平杨官屯袁丙文互助组的调查，该组施肥每亩一点二五大车，豆饼四十四斤，最少的也在二十斤以上。冀南区的施肥，一般的增加三分之一到二分之一，个别地区如元朝县，则已达到抗战前的施肥水平（战前通常是肥三车，豆饼则三十斤到五十斤。）
    获得以上成绩的基本原因，是由于土地改革的完成与人民解放战争的伟大胜利，前者消灭封建使无地少地的农民得到土地，后者鼓舞了农民胜利的情绪，并创造了生产建设的环境；加之土改整党中某些左倾错误的纠正，地权的确定，生产政策的贯彻，使各阶层能安心生产。此外各级党委抓紧季节，认真领导，劳英模范的带头，大量组织了全半劳力，以及贷粮、贷款等的扶助，使今年种麦获得了如上成绩。
    因此，将今年生产的成绩，简单的归功于“纠正”或认为“雨多种麦多”，是不全完对的；另一方面把灾害笼统归咎于“长期战争”与“土改中政策过左”更是错误。这都是对土地改革的完成与人民解放战争胜利的伟大意义估计不足，对其成绩肯定不够，及对党和人民团结斗争战胜灾害的认识不足的错误说法。
    另一方面，工作上还存在不少缺点。如计划不周到以及个别地方的强迫命令等。如冀鲁豫区的群众反映：“种麦太多了不行，到百分之六十五不能再多了”，因种多了柴草少，肥料少，都种上麦，活都赶在一块，忙不过来等。冀中有些群众，也因没有肥料，而不愿多种麦。这也说明我们在动员种麦中，有些地方没有根据当地土地气候及人民需要，作适当的计划。
