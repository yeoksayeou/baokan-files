Select Good Seeds to Produce More Grain
　Hengyue Farm Convenes Experienced Farmers to Discuss Experiences
[Beiyue Electric] The Beiyue Hengyue Farm (located in Hunyuan County) invited more than twenty experienced local farmers and county and district industrial cadres to a forum on the 11th of last month to discuss seed selection issues. According to the forum's feedback, the masses urgently need the following varieties: (1) High yield and early maturity, capable of producing more grain. Due to the cold climate in northern Shanxi, early spring frosts shorten the growing season, otherwise, the crops cannot mature. (2) Large ears and large grains. For example, the 'Ox-tail Yellow Millet,' although its yield exceeds the local standard millet—'Yata Che Millet'—its ears and grains are small, and the villagers dislike its seven or eight branches growing in a large clump, so it is not welcome. (3) Strong resistance to diseases and pests. Corn borers and *Sclerospora graminicola* are very common in northern Shanxi, greatly affecting yield. The masses demand pest and disease prevention. After two days of discussion, it was unanimously agreed that the superior variety is 'Yu Huang Millet,' with large ears, large grains, high yield, and strong stalks, resistant to corn borers. The next is 'Small Red Millet,' with a high yield, tight and thick ears, large grains, no diseases, and fewer pests, and early maturity. An old farmer said, "This millet can be planted in both paddy and dry land; I'm very confident in it." The third is 'Drought-resistant Millet,' with a yield exceeding the standard millet by 76 percent. It has many branches, strong stalks, and a short growing season. Everyone said that this millet can be widely promoted. For sorghum varieties, the first is 'Black Pants Jiao,' with a yield 14.8 percent higher than the standard sorghum, large ears, and fewer smut diseases. The second is 'Yingzhou Yellow Jiao,' with yield and maturity period similar to the standard Jiao, but larger ears and grains. There is also a type of sorghum locally called 'Upside-down Head,' with particularly large ears, because the ears face downward, so it is not afraid of wind or hail, and the masses demand to plant it. For broomcorn millet varieties, the masses believe that: 'Large White Millet' and 'Cockscomb Head' are suitable for planting in paddy and fertile land. Through the forum, the farm comrades further clarified the future direction of their work. For example, in terms of experimentation, it was determined that the crops should meet the following conditions: high yield, short growing season, large ears and grains, and strong resistance to diseases and pests. In terms of promotion, different varieties should be promoted according to different regions, climates, and soil types. The masses also broke away from some narrow views on increasing production, such as believing that "more fertilizer and frequent watering" is the only way to increase production. After this forum, everyone realized that under the same cultivation conditions, there are significant differences in yield due to different varieties. For example, 'Crisp White Millet' has a 42.2 percent yield reduction compared to the standard millet, while 'Northeast Large White Millet' has an 84 percent yield increase compared to the standard, giving the masses a new understanding of seed selection.

　　选好种籽多打粮食
  　恒岳农场召集老农谈经验
    【北岳电】北岳恒岳农场（设于浑源县）于上月十一日邀请附近村有经验的老农及县区实业干部共二十余人开座谈会，讨论选种问题。根据座谈反映，群众迫切需要下列品种：（一）产量大、成熟快，能多打粮食。因雁北地区气候寒冷，春霜过早，生长期不能过长，否则不能成熟。（二）穗大粒大。如牛尾黄谷，因穗粒较小，其产量虽超过当地标准谷——压塌车谷，但老乡嫌它长的七枝八杈一大窝，不欢迎。（三）抗病虫害力强的。钻心虫和白发病在雁北流行很普遍，影响产量极大，群众要求防病害。经过二天座谈，一致认为较优良的品种第一是玉黄谷，穗大粒大产量大，杆子硬，不生钻心虫。第一是小红谷，产量大，穗子紧而粗，颗粒大无病害，少虫害，成熟期早。老农说：“这谷子水旱地都能种，我真看准了。”第三是抗旱谷，产量超过标准谷百分之七十六。杈多杆子硬，时间亦不长。都说这谷子可普遍推广。高粱品种，第一是黑裤茭，产量比标准高粱增加百分之十四点八，穗大，黑穗病亦少。第二是应州黄茭，产量成熟期都与标准茭同，穗子大，颗粒亦大。还有一种高粱土名叫倒栽头，穗子特别大，因穗下栽，所以不怕风刮和雹打，群众要求种。黍子品种，群众认为：水地肥地宜种大白黍、鸡冠头二种。经过座谈，农场同志进一步明确了今后的工作方向，如在试验方面确定了作物要：产量大、时间短、穗大粒大、抗病虫害力强为当选条件。推广方面，要根据不同地区，气候与土质等，推广不同的品种。群众方面也打破了某些增产的狭隘观点，如认为“粪大水勤”是唯一的增产方法，经这次座谈，一致认识到在同一的条件培植下，因品种的不同，在产量上则有很大的差异。如酥白谷比标准谷减产百分之四十二点二，而东北大白谷则比标准增产百分之八十四，使群众对选种有了新的认识。
