Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 2nd. TASS dispatch: The Soviet Labor Daily published an article on October 25th entitled "From the Western European Union to the North Atlantic Treaty," stating that according to the plans of the initiators of the North Atlantic Treaty, the United States, Canada, and the five Western European Union countries will be the main participants in the treaty. Their concept is that the North Atlantic Treaty should have an obvious military nature. The London Times wrote in its editorial on October 28th: The treaty will provide certain guarantees in exchange for certain obligations. In other words, the North Atlantic Treaty is planned as a stage in the war preparations diplomatically made by the US expansionist group.

The United States and Latin American countries signed the "Western Hemisphere Joint Defense" Inter-American Treaty in Rio de Janeiro, the capital of Brazil, on September 2, 1947. Through this treaty, the United States paved the way for establishing its political and military control over the Western Hemisphere. On March 17, 1948, the "Western European Union" was established in Brussels. It was there and at that time that Spaak (referring to the Prime Minister of Belgium) and his Dutch and Luxembourg colleagues expressed the hope to expand the "Western European Union" so that it would combine with the Rio de Janeiro Treaty. The North Atlantic Treaty is planned as a supplement to the Rio de Janeiro Treaty, and its method is to incorporate the "Western European Union" countries into the "US security zone." Before the meeting of the Foreign Ministers of the Western European Union in Paris to discuss the North Atlantic Treaty, the US State Department and the ambassadors of the five Western European Union countries to the United States, as well as Marshall and the Foreign Ministers of the Western European Union, held long-term secret talks behind the United Nations General Assembly in Washington and Paris respectively. The United States, Canada, Britain, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg acted as the "founders" of the North Atlantic Alliance, while at the same time conducting extensive diplomatic activities, trying to incorporate the Scandinavian countries, Iceland, Italy, Portugal and other countries into the alliance. Up to now, they still dare not openly talk about allowing Franco's Spain to participate in this treaty. However, even now, Spain's economic and strategic relations with the United States are already very close. Special attention was given to the West German question. The famous advocates of the US "bipartisan" foreign policy formulated by Wall Street business houses established their plan to control Europe, first focusing on West Germany as a base, and carefully preserving and cultivating Nazi cadres there. West Germany and its heavy industrial magnates, Junker aristocrats, and Nazis who found refuge there were designated to play the leading role in the war-mongering plan.

The main points of the North Atlantic Treaty stipulate a joint military center—the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the North Atlantic Alliance and a new version of the Lend-Lease Act. People will remember that the meeting of the Defense Ministers of the Western European Union countries held in Paris on September 27 and 28 resulted in the organization of the "Western European Joint Chiefs of Staff." When the "Joint Chiefs of Staff" was formed, there was a fierce dispute between the French and British commands, both of whom demanded the leading position in the "Joint Chiefs of Staff." Finally, Britain eased France with an extremely sloppy and obvious compromise. The position of commander of the "European Army" was assigned to a French general, the position of commander of the "European Air Force" was assigned to a British general, and the "European Navy" was subordinated to a French general. However, Field Marshal Montgomery, who served as chairman of the Commanders' Committee, was placed above them as "Commander-in-Chief," so that Britain gained the leading position in the "Western European General Staff." It should be pointed out that the "Western European General Staff" building, which was built so painstakingly, turned out to be short-lived. The Associated Press declared that the United States had no intention of giving the supreme command to France or Britain. According to the US plan for the North Atlantic Treaty, a "seven-nation joint general staff headed by the United States" is to be established. The so-called "North Atlantic Treaty" is a means for the United States to degrade Britain, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg into bridgeheads for its military and political expansion. As for the new version of the Lend-Lease Act, it is the same method as in the last war, providing weapons to the European allies of the North Atlantic Alliance under the US arms supply plan. According to the New York Herald Tribune, things are ready and waiting to be submitted to Congress in January next year. The United Press International solemnly estimated, based on information obtained from military and diplomatic circles, that the new alliance will cost the United States 2 billion US dollars each year. The big bosses in the United States expect that this will be able to maintain the artificial war boom in the industry. The United States linked the new version of the Lend-Lease Act with agreements on the standardization of armaments and training. Finally, according to the Associated Press, the Atlantic Treaty will guarantee the United States and Canada the right to establish air, land, and naval bases in any country participating in the treaty. Therefore, it is very clear that the North Atlantic Treaty is only planned as the main tool in the gambling of American and British war-mongers. The Rio de Janeiro Treaty, the Marshall Plan, the formation of the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg group, and the establishment of the "Western European Union" are all just one stage after another towards turning the Marshallized countries into American bridgeheads.

However, the conspiracies of those who conspire against peace have met with increasing opposition from the masses. Stalin said of the war-mongers' conspiracies: All this "can only result in the shameful failure of the new war-mongers. Churchill, the main instigator of the new war, has already made himself lose the trust of his own people and the democratic forces of the world in him. The same fate awaits all other war-mongers."

### 苏劳动报揭露“北大西洋联盟”阴谋  新战争鼓动者的诡计在人民反对下必失败

　　苏劳动报揭露“北大西洋联盟”阴谋
    新战争鼓动者的诡计在人民反对下必失败
    【新华社陕北二日电】塔斯社讯：苏联劳动报于十月二十五日发表题为“从西欧联盟到北大西洋公约”的论文称：按照北大西洋公约发起人的计划，美、加和西欧联盟五国将是参加这一公约的主要国家。他们的观念是北大西洋公约应具有显然的军事性质。伦敦泰晤士报十月二十八日的社论写道：公约将对一定的义务给以一定的保证作为交换。换句话说，北大西洋公约是作为美国扩张主义集团从外交上作战争准备的一个阶段而计划的。
    美国和拉丁美洲各国于一九四七年九月二日，曾在巴西首都里约热内卢签订“西半球联防”泛美公约。借此公约，美国铺平了确立其对西半球政治和军事控制的道路。一九四八年三月十七日，“西欧联盟”在布鲁塞尔建立。正是在那里和那个时候，斯巴克（按系比利时总理）及其荷兰、卢森堡的同僚，表示希望扩大“西欧联盟”，使它与里约热内卢公约相结合。北大西洋公约是计划作为对里约热内卢公约的补充，它的办法是把“西欧联盟”各国纳入“美国的安全区”。在巴黎西欧联盟外长会议讨论北大西洋公约之前，美国国务院和西欧联盟五国驻美大使，及马歇尔和西欧联盟各外长，曾分别在华盛顿和巴黎联合国大会背后进行长期的秘密会谈。美、加、英、法、荷、比、卢摆起北大西洋联盟“创始人”的样子，同时又大事进行外交活动，想把斯堪的纳维亚国家、冰岛、意大利、葡萄牙和其他国家也纳入联盟。到现在为止，他们还不敢公开谈论使佛朗哥西班牙参加这一公约，然而，甚至在现在，西班牙在经济和战略方面，与美国的关系已经是十分密切的了。西德问题被给予了特别的注意。华尔街公事房制订的美国“两党”外交政策的著名的鼓吹者们，建立了他们统制欧洲的计划，首先着眼于以西德作基地，并在那里小心地保存和培养纳粹干部。西德及其重工业大王、容克贵族和在那里找到庇护所的纳粹分子，被指定担任战争贩子计划中的主角。
    北大西洋公约的要点，规定联合军事中心——北大西洋联盟联合参谋部和新版的租借法案。人们会记起，西欧联盟各国国防部长于九月二十七、二十八两日在巴黎举行的会议，产生了“西欧联合参谋部”的组织。“联合参谋部”组成时，法、英统帅部之间曾发生激烈争吵，双方都要求“联合参谋部”中的领导地位。最后，英国以极其潦草而明显的妥协缓和了法国。“欧洲陆军”司令一职委派给法国将军，“欧洲空军”司令委派给英国将军，“欧洲海军”附属于法国将军。但是，身任司令官委员会主席的蒙哥马利元帅，被置于他们之上作为“总司令”，这样，英国就取得了“西欧参谋部”中的领导地位。应当指出的是，这样费事地建立起来的“西欧参谋部”大厦，结果却是短命的。美联社宣称，美国没有意思把最高指挥让给法国或英国。按照美国的北大西洋公约计划，要成立一个“以美国人为首的七国联合参谋部”。所谓“北大西洋公约”就是美国降英、法、荷、比、卢为其军事和政治扩张的桥头阵地的手段。至于新版的租借法，即按照上次大战时的同样办法，以美国武器供给计划下的北大西洋联盟的欧洲各盟国。据纽约先驱论坛报宣称，事情已经准备就绪，只等提交明年一月的国会。合众社根据在军事和外交界人士中所获得的情报，郑重其事地估计，新联盟每年将花费美国二十亿美元。美国的大老板们期望这样将能够维持工业中人为的战争景气。美国把新版租借法，与军备和训练标准化的协议联结在一起。最后，据美联社称，大西洋公约将保证美、加有权在参加公约的任何一国建立空、陆、海军基地。因此，十分明显地，北大西洋公约只是计划作为美、英战争贩子赌博中的主要工具，里约热内卢公约、马歇尔计划、荷、比、卢集团的形成与“西欧联盟”的建立，所有这一切，都只是走向把马歇尔化的各国变为美国桥头阵地的一个又一个阶段。
    但是，那些阴谋反对和平的人们的阴谋诡计，已遇到群众越来越大的反对。斯大林论及战争贩子的阴谋时说：所有这一切，“其结果只能是新战争鼓动者的可耻的失败。邱吉尔这个新战争的主要鼓动者，业已做到了使自己丧失其本国人民和全世界民主力量对他的信任。同一命运等待着其他的一切战争鼓动者。”
