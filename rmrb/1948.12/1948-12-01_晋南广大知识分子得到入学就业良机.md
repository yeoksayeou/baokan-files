　　Xinhua News Agency, Linfen, 28th—Education in the liberated areas of Southern Shanxi, including Linfen and 29 other counties, is experiencing vigorous development. A large number of intellectuals who lost their opportunity to study or were unemployed under Kuomintang rule are now getting good opportunities for enrollment and employment. The entire region now has eight regular middle schools, three normal schools, and five specialized schools for training military, industrial, health, and administrative cadres, as well as 4,419 primary schools. According to preliminary statistics, approximately 246,000 students have enrolled in various schools, including about 5,000 students in secondary schools and above. The vast majority of the original faculty and staff of middle and primary schools have remained in their original positions. In addition, more than 10,000 intellectuals have joined the work in various agencies, schools, and military units. In order to solve the enrollment difficulties of poor children, the People's Government has formulated measures for government-funded students. In addition to full funding for normal schools and cadre schools, it is stipulated that the quota for government-funded students in ordinary middle schools will account for 25%, and the quota for government-funded students in senior primary schools will account for 10% to 15%. Even junior primary schools will have a quota of 5% for government subsidies for textbooks and stationery.
　　Through learning and practical life experiences, the vast number of intellectuals in Southern Shanxi have gradually recognized the essential differences between the Kuomintang reactionaries and the Communist Party. Students who participated in reactionary organizations such as the Kuomintang, the Three People's Principles Youth League, and the Comrades Association have voluntarily registered with the People's Government and declared their withdrawal from reactionary organizations. Sun Jirong, a student at Linfen Normal School, did not want to stay in the liberated area to study when Fushan County was liberated the year before last. Harboring illusions of so-called "neutrality" and the "Third Road," he went to the fertile land ruled by the Yan bandits. There, he could not bear the hardship of being forced to work by the enemy every day, so he transferred to Linfen, where he was eventually captured by the Kuomintang and made a military policeman. After the liberation of Linfen, Sun Jirong once again saw the People's Liberation Army and the People's Government and was treated kindly and released. He was deeply moved by this. Sun Jirong is now studying at ease in school. Many young intellectuals who held the same ideas as him now realize that even studying requires a good political environment, and the best environment is the liberated area.

　　晋南广大知识分子得到入学就业良机
    【新华社临汾二十八日电】解放了的晋南地区临汾等廿九县，学校教育已有蓬勃发展。国民党统治时失学、失业的大批知识分子，现在得到了入学、就业的良好机会。全区现共有普通中学八所，师范三所，培养军事、工业、卫生、行政干部的专门学校五所，小学四千四百十九所。据初步统计，已入各种学校求学的学生约有二十四万六千人，其中中等学校以上的学生约五千人。原有中、小学的教职员，绝大多数均留任原职。此外，有一万名以上的知识分子已参加了各机关、学校、部队的工作。人民政府为解决贫苦子弟的入学困难，已拟订了公费生办法，除师范及干部学校全部公费外，规定普通中学的公费生名额占百分之二十五，高小公费生名额占百分之十至十五，初小也有百分之五的名额由政府补助课本及文具。
    在学习与实际生活的体验中，晋南广大的知识分子已经逐渐认识国民党反动派和共产党在本质上的区别。参加过国民党、三青团、同志会等反动组织的学生，纷纷自动向人民政府登记，并声明脱离反动组织。临汾师范学生孙继荣，当前年浮山县被解放时，不愿留在解放区读书，抱着所谓“中立”、“第三条道路”的幻想，到了阎匪统治的肥沃。在那里，他受不了整天被敌强迫作工的苦，又转学到临汾，结果，他被国民党抓去当宪兵。临汾解放后，孙继荣再次见到了解放军和人民政府，受到宽待和释放。因此大受感动，孙继荣现在已安心在学校读书，许多与他抱同样思想的知识青年，现在都体验到即是读书也要有一个好的政治环境，而最好的环境就是解放区。
