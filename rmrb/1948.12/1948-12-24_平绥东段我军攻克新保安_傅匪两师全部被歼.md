Xinhua News Agency, Ping-Sui Front, 22nd Dispatch: The two divisions and local militia of Fu's 35th Army, which were surrounded in Xinbao'an, west of Huailai on the eastern section of the Ping-Sui Railway, were completely annihilated this afternoon. The results of the battle are currently being tallied. The People's Liberation Army launched its general offensive at dawn on the 22nd and annihilated the enemy in just eleven hours of fighting. The 35th Army was the main force upon which Fu relied to build his fortune.

[Ping-Sui Front Telegram] Frontline reporter Fang Yatian reported on the battle to eliminate Fu's Beiping "Suppression General Headquarters" directly subordinate 271st Division, describing the process of capturing the division commander Zhang Jinxin alive: On the 7th, after the battle on Nanpingding Mountain in Yulinbao subsided, it was said that Fu's bandit Zhang Jinxin had been killed. The reporter, along with his captured guard, intended to search for his body. In a small ditch below a cliff, they discovered a wounded soldier with deep-set eyes, a pointed chin, barefoot, and covered in mud, moaning. When he saw us coming, his moaning grew louder. He lazily raised his head and said to us, "Save my life!" In fact, his injuries were not too serious. Seeing that he was wounded, we sent someone to call a stretcher and carried him to the sanatorium, where many wounded soldiers were being carefully treated by our army. After this barefoot soldier entered, he used his hat to cover almost his entire face. The medic brought him porridge, and he drank five bowls in one go without looking up. The reporter asked his name, and he said, "My surname is Wang, my name is Bizuo, and I am a lieutenant adjutant in the division headquarters." At this time, the guard, who had been relieved of his doubts, walked up to him and said, "This is our division commander, Zhang." His face turned pale instantly. He murmured, not knowing how to answer. This Major General division commander, personally promoted by Fu Zuoyi, became a prisoner of the People's Liberation Army in this way.

　　平绥东段我军攻克新保安
    傅匪两师全部被歼
    【新华社平绥前线二十二日急电】被围于平绥东段怀来以西新保安的傅匪三十五军两个师及地方团队等，已于今日下午全部被歼。战果正清查中。解放军系于二十二日拂晓开始总攻，战斗仅历十一小时，即将该敌全部歼灭。三十五军系傅匪赖以起家的主力。
    【平绥前线电】平绥前线记者房亚田报导歼傅匪北平“剿总”直辖二七一师战斗中，活捉该师师长张进信的经过称：七号那天榆林堡南平顶山的战斗平息了，据谈傅匪张进信已被打死，记者带了他已被俘的卫兵打算寻找他的尸体。在一段山崖下面的小沟里，发现一个深眼窝、尖下颚、赤着脚满身泥土的伤兵正在哼哼。当他发现我们来时，他的哼哼声越发大了。这时他懒洋洋的抬起头来对我们说：“救我的活命吧！”其实他的伤并不太重。我们见他是伤兵，便派人叫了担架把他抬到疗养所去，那里有许多伤兵正在被我军细心的治疗着。这位赤脚的伤兵一进去后用帽子几乎连他的眼睛都盖起来。卫生员给他送稀饭，他头也不抬的一气喝了五碗。记者问他的姓名，他说：“姓王叫毗作，是师部的中尉副官”。这时已解除疑虑的卫士走到他的跟前说：“这就是我们的张师长。”他的脸霎时变得苍白。喃喃的不知所答。这位傅匪作义一手提拔的少将师长，就这样作了人民解放军的俘虏。
