Ningnan County Production Promotion Cooperative
    Massively Purchases Finished Products, Greatly Developing Mass Production
    [This Newspaper's Report] This newspaper's reporter, Su Youmin, reports: The Ningnan County Production Promotion Cooperative, in organizing disaster area masses for production and overcoming famine, has found the correct path for developing its business. Initially, the promotion cooperative had a purely profit-driven perspective, and with limited capital, it feared losses, thus being hesitant and unsure of where to start. Later, upon learning that the cloth woven, mats woven, and hemp produced by the masses in the disaster areas had no market, and that the masses themselves lacked the ability to transport these goods externally, and that the masses urgently needed to solve the problems of food and firewood, it was decided to start here. It first started by collecting cloth, helping the masses solve the problem of sales. Later, when the masses lacked cooked cotton for spinning and weaving, it bought four cotton gins, thus solving the problem of cooked cotton. To make it easier for the masses to deliver cloth, the Beiyu Village market was restored, using it as a center to specifically collect cloth and buy hemp. Later, it also helped restore the thirty-eight iron-wheel looms in Liujia Tai, thus making spinning increasingly active. The masses said, "Being able to sell hemp has saved our lives." "As long as we can sell cloth, what are we afraid of? This is better than receiving relief grain once!" From then on, the masses shifted from waiting for and relying on relief to self-reliant production. To further organize the masses in disaster areas for production, it was specifically clarified at the production meeting in mid-October that the focus in disaster areas should be on supporting spinning and weaving, leaching saltpeter, and weaving mats, and fertilizer yards were established and cotton and grain were brought in. In addition, it was stipulated that bank loans and the Saltpeter and Sulfur Bureau's collection of saltpeter should all go through the Production Promotion Cooperative, so as to unify the leadership of mass production. With everyone's active efforts, achievements have been made in November. In terms of leaching saltpeter: the number of saltpeter producers in the county increased from 1,200 in October to 1,933. According to statistics from twenty-three villages in the flood-stricken area, a total of 23,790 catties of saltpeter were produced, which could be exchanged for 144,800 catties of red grain. In terms of the textile industry: in the twenty-three villages in the flood-stricken area, more than 5,400 women have been involved in spinning and weaving. In November, in addition to selling thread, a total of 5,049 bolts of cloth were woven, all of which were purchased and sold on consignment by the promotion cooperative. Another 2,932 bolts of military cloth are being rushed to be woven, and it is estimated that they can be completed soon, which can yield more than 450,000 catties of red grain. In Laowangzhuang, Liujiafang and other villages, 856 people are participating in the mat weaving and mat basket weaving industry. In November, a total of more than 6,960 pieces were woven. Calculating that each mat is woven with 30 sorghum stalks, using 1,000 Jibi currency as capital, one can be sold for around 2,500 yuan. Each person can weave three mats a day, earning a profit of 4,500 yuan; in addition, the remaining sorghum stalk skins and cores can also be used for a day's firewood. The Beiyu Village area is alluvial land with good soil quality, and fertilization is not very common in farming. The masses lack the habit of accumulating fertilizer, and pigs are not kept in pens. The promotion cooperative established fertilizer yards here to purchase wet fertilizer, thus encouraging the masses to collect fertilizer. Now the fertilizer yards can collect 120,000 to 170,000 yuan worth of fertilizer every day. In November, a total of 1,161,000 yuan was spent on buying fertilizer. Yan Jinbao, 53 years old, and Feng Peng, over 60 years old, both from Jia Village, collected a large cart of fertilizer in one month. The vice-chairman of the Beiyu Village Farmers' Association said, "If the fertilizer yard can collect fertilizer until next spring, the income from fertilizer alone in Beiyu Village can increase by 20%." In addition to this, the promotion cooperative also contracted 15,000 cubic meters of earthwork for the Fuyang River project for the masses. Currently, 600 workers have started digging, and it is calculated that 10,800 cubic meters of earthwork can be completed in eighteen days, earning 113,400 catties of red grain in addition to food. Another 1,400 workers are repairing the Ai and Wang bridges, earning 14,700 catties of red grain. At the same time, 1,746 catties of cotton, 11,031 catties of charcoal, and 13,000 catties of miscellaneous grains were transferred to the twenty-three villages in the disaster area. In organizing transportation, 47 carts in the disaster area were mobilized, and the cart owners earned a total of 1,570,000 Jibi currency, solving some of the difficulties in raising livestock. Due to the various support of the Production Promotion Cooperative and active production, the living difficulties of the masses in the disaster area have been largely resolved, and they are still working hard in production.

　　宁南县生产推进社
    大量收购制成品  群众生产大发展
    【本报讯】本报记者苏幼民报导：宁南县生产推进社，在组织灾区群众生产渡荒中，摸到正确发展业务门路。开始推进社存在单纯营利观点，本钱又小只害怕赔本，因而束手束脚，无处下手。后来了解到灾区群众织的布、编的席、出产的麻都没销路，群众自己又没力外运，而且群众又急待解决粮食和烧柴的困难，于是便确定从此入手。首先动手收布，帮助群众解决了销路困难。后来群众纺织缺了熟穰，就买了四盘轧车轧花，这样又解决了熟穰困难。为使群众交布方便，又把北鱼村集市恢复了起来，以此为中心，专门收布买麻。后又帮助刘家台的三十八张铁轮织布机恢复起来，这样纺线的也日益活跃起来。群众说：“麻能卖了，可把我们救活了。”“只要能卖布，我们还怕啥？这比发一次救济粮还强呢！”从此，群众从等待和依赖救济转到生产自救。为更进一步组织灾区群众生产，特在十月中旬生产会上，又明确了灾区应以扶助纺织、淋硝、编席为重点，并设立粪场和调进棉粮。另外规定了银行办信贷、硝磺局收硝都通过生产推进社，以便统一领导群众生产。在大家的积极努力之下，在十一月份已获得成绩。在淋硝方面：全县硝民由十月份的一千二百名增到一千九百三十三名，据水灾区二十三个村的统计，共出硝二万三千七百九十斤，可换得红粮十四万四千八百斤。纺织业方面：水灾区二十三个村中，已有五千四百多妇女卷入了纺织，十一月份除卖线子以外，共织出五千零四十九匹布，全县由推进社购买代销了。另有军布二千九百三十二匹正在赶织，估计最近可以完成，这样即可得红粮四十五万多斤。老王庄、刘家坊等村的编席、编席篓业，已有八百五十六人参加，十一月共编了六千九百六十多件，按三十根秫秸编一个，用冀钞一千元本钱，一个可卖二千五百元上下，每人每天编三个，可得利四千五百元；另外所剩的秫秸皮和心还可供一天的烧柴。北鱼村一带是泊波地，土质较好，种地不大上粪，群众缺乏积肥习惯，喂猪都不圈起来。推进社就在这里设立了粪场收买湿粪，这样便鼓励了群众集肥。现在粪场每天能收十二万到十七万元的粪，十一月份共支出买粪钱一百一十六万一千元。贾庄五十三岁的阎金保、六十多岁的冯朋，一个月都拾了一大车粪。北鱼村农会副主任说：“如果粪场收粪能收到明年春天，北鱼村光得的粪钱可增加二成年景。”除此以外，推进社还替群众包揽了滏阳河河工一万五千方土，现已由六百个工开始挖掘，计算十八天能挖完一万零八百方土，除了吃能挣红粮十一万三千四百斤。另外修艾、王桥的瓦木工一千四百个工，可得红粮一万四千七百斤。同时又向灾区二十三村调进了棉花一千七百四十六斤，炭一万一千零三十一斤，杂粮一万三千斤。在组织运输中，带动起灾区大车四十七辆，车户共得冀钞一百五十七万元，解决了部分牲畜饲养困难。由于生产推进社的多方支持与积极生产下，灾区群众生活困难已大部解决，现仍在努力生产中。
