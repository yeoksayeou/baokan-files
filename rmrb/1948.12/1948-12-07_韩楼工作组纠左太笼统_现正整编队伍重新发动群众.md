(Jilu Yu Telegram) Although Hanlou Village, in the first district of Guancheng, had undergone land reform in the past, the land problem had not been resolved, judging from the land ownership of each class and stratum. The sixteen landlords each averaged 4.85 mu (standard mu, same below); the seventy-eight well-to-do peasants averaged 3.91 mu each; the 379 middle peasants averaged 3.74 mu each; and the 557 poor peasants averaged only 3 mu each. Of the thirteen landlord and rich peasant households, only two did not raise livestock, and some even raised two oxen, possessing all farm implements and living in their original houses. Twenty-one houses were confiscated during the land reform, but have not yet been distributed, and landlords still retained a large portion of their property. Middle peasants suffered some damage, but not much. Among the eight wrongly struggled middle peasant households, only one had no livestock, and the land was generally above three mu, with only one household having 2.5 mu of land, but still raising one and a half oxen, and their lives were not difficult. Some of the poor and hired peasants had their demands met, while others did not. There were still fifty-four poor peasant households with less than three mu in the whole village, accounting for 40% of the poor peasant stratum, and eighteen households lacked houses. The militia instructor, with a family of four, only had one and a half small thatched huts.

The reason for the incomplete land reform was that the branch had mistakenly stipulated during the land reform: landlords and rich peasants would retain three to four mu of land, and poor peasants would be filled to 2.65 mu. During the review, the branch's thinking was: if other villages take one step, our village will follow one step. Not in the front, nor falling far behind (fearing that other villages would come to struggle, and things would run out). The leadership did not understand this situation and subjectively made a work plan: the first step was to hold a branch meeting to examine thoughts, asking party members to offer opinions to the branch committee leadership; the second step was to publicize and determine land rights, correct policies (referring to correcting "leftist" deviations), and reorganize the peasant association; the third step was to talk about class, classify classes, correct wrongly struggled elements, and remove the labels of wrongly struggled households; the fourth step was to adjust land and determine land rights; and the fifth step was to issue land certificates. According to this work plan, the work team first conducted ideological self-criticism in the branch, but without in-depth mobilization, the party members did not know what they should self-criticize and what the purpose was. A series of three plenary party member meetings, two committee meetings, and one branch committee group leader meeting were held, confusedly and formalistically forcing party members to offer opinions to the branch committee, and calling on group leaders to "take the lead!" guaranteeing that party members would "offer opinions!" As a result, the branch became lifeless, and some party members said: "What's the point of ideological work! Can't we just do whatever we're told?" "Who can compare with your district cadres!" At this time, the leadership was still not aware, and continued to push down, so the first branch meeting ended without results. Then, the leadership announced at a mass meeting the dissolution of the turnaround team (i.e., poor peasant group) and called for the establishment of a new peasant association. As a result, the more branch meetings were held, the less interested people became, and the fewer people attended the mass meetings. Han Fu, who was struggled against, openly asked poor peasants for a bed in the street. The landlord Han Shande, publicized in the street, saying: "I was wronged in the struggle." The poor peasants were discouraged. The turnaround team leader, Han Xinqi, who used to be very active, felt that he had no status after the announcement of the dissolution of the turnaround team, and was not responsible in his work. Some poor peasants said: "We have also struggled, but our situation hasn't changed. Whatever the superiors say is what it is!" The poor peasant Han Zhongdao dissatisfiedly said: "We haven't turned ourselves around yet, the superiors don't care! What can we do!" But the work team was still not aware, and instead said that the masses were "backward" and the party members were "not playing a role." It was not until they could no longer continue that they began to study the basic situation of the village. After a day of analysis, research, and inspection, it was re-determined that the village's future policy would be to reorganize the class ranks, correct the branch's right-leaning views, mobilize the masses, completely eliminate feudalism, appropriately meet the demands of the poor and hired peasants, end the land reform, and develop production. (The infringement of the interests of middle peasants should also be appropriately corrected – Editor) On the same day, the branch committee was convened to begin the transformation.

　　韩楼工作组纠左太笼统
  　现正整编队伍重新发动群众
    【冀鲁豫电】观城一区韩楼村过去虽然进行过土改，但从各阶级阶层土地占有状况看，土地问题并未解决。地主十六人，每人平均四点八五亩（标准亩，下同）；当农七十八人，每人平均三点九一亩，中农三七九人，每人三点七四亩；贫农五五七人，每人只三亩。地富十三户，只两户没喂牲口，有的还喂两头牛，农具全有，都住原房，土改中没收了二十一间房子，现还未分配，地主仍保留很大一部分财产。中农受了些损伤，但不大，错斗的八户中农中，没牲口的只一户，土地一般都在三亩以上，只有一户是二亩五分地，但还喂牛一头半，生活也不困难。贫雇农有的满足了要求，还有一部分没满足。全村三亩以下的贫农还有五十四户，占贫农层百分之四十，缺少房子的有十八户。民兵指导员四口人，只有一间半小草屋。
    土改不彻底的原因，是支部在土改时曾错误地规定：地富留地三亩以上四亩以下，贫农填到二亩六分五。在复查中支部思想是：外村走一步，咱村跟一步。不在前边，也不落在很后边（怕外村来斗，东西往外跑）。领导上未了解此种情况，即主观的作出了工作计划为：第一步开支部会检查思想，叫党员对支委领导提意见；第二步，宣传确定地权，端正政策（按指纠正左偏），整理农会；第三步，讲阶级、划阶级，改正错斗成份，摘掉错斗户的帽子；第四步，调剂土地，确定地权；第五步发土地证。工作组根据这一工作计划，首先在支部中进行思想检讨，但亦未经深入动员，党员也不知道自己应该检讨什么，目的是什么。一连串的开了三个全体党员大会，两个委会，一个支委小组长会，糊里糊涂，形式主义地硬逼着党员给支委提意见，并号召小组长“带头呀！”保证党员“提意见呀！”结果弄的支部死气沉沉，有的党员说：“搞啥思想呀！叫干啥就干啥不行吗？”“谁能与你区干比呀！”这时领导上仍不自觉，一个劲的往下搞，所以第一个支部会就无结果而散了。接着领导上又在群众大会上宣布解散了翻身队（即贫农组），号召成立新农会。结果开支部会是越开越没劲，群众会越开人越少，被斗户韩福公开在街上向贫农要床。地主韩善德，在街上宣传说：“斗争我屈了。”贫农丧气，翻身队长韩新起过去很积极，自宣布解散翻身队后，感觉没有自己地位，工作也不负责了。还有的贫农说：“也斗争啦，身也没翻了，上级说啥是啥就是啦！”贫农韩中道不满意说：“咱还没翻身，上级不兴啦！啥法呀！”但工作组仍不自觉，反而说群众“落后”，党员“不起作用”。一直到再也不能作下去了，才开始研究本村基本情况。经过一天的分析研究检查，重新确定该村今后方针为整编阶级队伍，纠正支部右倾观点发动群众，彻底消灭封建，适当满足贫雇农要求，结束土改，发展生产。（对侵犯中农利益亦应适当予以纠正——编者）当天即召开支委会开始进行转变。
