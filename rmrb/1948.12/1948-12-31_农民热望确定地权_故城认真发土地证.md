　　Peasants Eager to Confirm Land Rights
  　Gu Cheng Seriously Issues Land Certificates
    Announces Old Contracts are Null and Void
  　Burning or Keeping is Up to Them
    [This Newspaper Reports] The Gu Cheng County Committee of Ji'nan, in accordance with the demands of the masses, emphasized that in ending the land reform, full importance should be attached to the work of issuing land certificates, and detailed instructions were given on the purpose and method of issuing land certificates. In the first batch of pilot villages in the county, the leftover problems from the land reform have been dealt with, but the land certificates hoped for by the masses have not been issued in a timely manner. The main reason is that the leadership did not pay enough attention to this work and did not realize that this is a new issue of great concern to the masses and is very complicated to carry out. They simply printed and distributed the filling methods issued by the North China Government to the villages, which caused the cadres to encounter many complex practical problems that could not be solved. For example, the masses were reluctant to take out or truly did not have the old land contracts, some had them for this piece of land but not for that piece, and some even forged documents. The housing sites were especially complicated. Therefore, some villages took detours in the process. For example, when Da Wu Mao started writing, none of the masses were willing to write first. Later, it was decided to collect the old documents first, and as a result, nineteen families were collected in one day, and there were still fakes. In view of the above situation, the County Committee emphasized that the leadership must fully estimate and attach importance to this work, and it cannot be done well by a few people. The branch committee and village cadre meeting should first be held to study the specific methods for completing this work in light of the actual situation of the village, and then a mass meeting should be held to explain that the historical task of land reform has been completed, and land and houses have been distributed according to the needs of each household. In order for everyone to carry out production well and become prosperous, land ownership certificates are issued. It is announced that the old land contracts are null and void, and that in the future, if land disputes occur, or if land is pawned or sold, the new contract shall be the sole basis. If they wish to keep the old land contracts, they are free to use them. Those who have concealed land and voluntarily report it will be issued land certificates, and no past offenses will be investigated. If they deliberately fail to report it, it will be confiscated if found out in the future. Before the land certificates are issued, land and houses can be freely exchanged under the principle of voluntariness. In order to carry out this work in a planned and organized manner, the Farmers' Association can be the main body, absorbing various talents such as those who can fill in forms and measure land, to organize a land certificate issuing committee, and set up filling groups, measurement groups, registration review and mediation groups, etc. as needed. Designate a place and time to start work, register by household, and use the city ruler as the standard, convert it, and fill in the new land and house certificates. Those who wish to keep the old land contracts are free to do so. For land without contracts or newly distributed fruit land, measurement will be carried out. For those without contracts, first try to get enough from the four neighbors, and then measure the household's own land, to prevent those with contracts from deliberately not taking them out and taking the opportunity to make trouble.

　　农民热望确定地权
  　故城认真发土地证
    宣布旧契一概作废
  　愿烧愿留听任自便
    【本报讯】冀南故城县委根据群众要求，强调结束土改中，应充分重视发土地证工作，并详细指示发土地证的目的与作法。该县第一批基点村，土改中的遗留问题已处理完毕，但群众所希望的土地证，仍未适时的颁发。主要原因是领导上对这一工作重视不够，未认识到这是群众非常关心而进行起来又非常复杂的新问题，只将华北政府发的填写办法，原套印发各村，使干部到村遇到了很多复杂的实际问题无法解决。如群众对旧文契的留恋不愿拿出或真没有，有的是这块地有，那块地没有，甚至有造假文书的。尤其宅子更为复杂。因此在进行中有的村是走了弯路。如大梧茂开始写时，群众谁也不愿先写，后来决定先收旧文书，结果一天收了十九家还有假的。根据上述情况，县委会强调指出，领导上必须充分估计与重视这个工作，少数人包办是作不好的。应先在支部会村干会上，结合本村情况进行研究，确定完成这一工作的具体办法，然后召开群众会，说明土改的历史任务已经完成，土地房屋已根据各户需要进行了分配，为了大家很好的进行生产，发家致富，故发给土地所有证。宣布旧文契作废，今后如土地发生纠纷，或典当、买卖，完全以新契为凭，如愿保留旧文契，听其自使。有黑瞒地自动报出即发给土地证，不咎既往，如故意不报，日后查出即行没收。未发土地证前土地房屋在自愿原则下可自由兑换。为了有计划有组织的进行这一工作，可以农会为主，吸收填写丈量等各种人材，组织发土地证委员会，根据需要设填写组、丈量组、登记审查调解组等，规定地点、时间开始工作，以户为单位进行登记，以市尺为标准，折合后填写新土地房屋证。如愿保留旧文契的可听任自便。对没有文书或新分之果实地则进行丈量。没有文契的，首先尽四邻要够，再丈量本户的，以防有文书故意不拿出趁机捣鬼。
