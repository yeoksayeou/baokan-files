[Jizhong Electric Dispatch] The Jizhong Tenth Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently issued instructions to the counties bordering the Daqing River, calling on all localities to seize the current favorable opportunity and vigorously launch a political offensive. The instructions first detailed the great victories of the autumn offensives on various battlefields. In North China, Baoding, the capital of Hebei Province, has been liberated, and the liberation of Peiping, Tianjin, and Taiyuan is imminent. Influenced by the victorious situation on all fronts, the Chiang Kai-shek-Fu Zuoyi bandit troops are increasingly shaken. Zhu Zhankui, the Commissioner of the Third Administrative Region of Hebei Province of the Kuomintang and concurrently Commander of the Security Forces, has led his troops to surrender. Under this unprecedentedly favorable situation, the Prefectural Committee has decided to mobilize the entire Party, government, army, and people of the entire region to vigorously launch a political offensive.

In terms of propaganda content, emphasis should be placed on: 1. Strengthening the propaganda of the current victorious situation of the People's Liberation War, repeatedly and deeply publicizing the assessment of the Chinese military situation by the person in charge of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, explaining that our army currently has advantages in both quality and quantity, and that in about a year, it may be possible to fundamentally overthrow the reactionary government of the Kuomintang. Publicize the great victories in the autumn offensives on various battlefields, especially after the complete liberation of the Northeast, the Northeast People's Liberation Army will soon enter the pass to cooperate with the People's Liberation Army in the pass in combat, and the complete liberation of North China is not far off. 2. Conduct propaganda on the lenient policy of our Party and our army, explaining that Zhu Zhankui led his troops to surrender under the influence of our army's powerful offensive and the appeal of the lenient policy, pointing out a way out for the Kuomintang army in Peiping, Tianjin, and other places, and calling on Kuomintang officers and soldiers to make a decisive decision, revolt, surrender, or lay down their weapons early. Continuing to resist stubbornly will only lead to death. At the same time, publicize the order of the General Headquarters of the People's Liberation Army to arrest war criminals, and strictly point out to Kuomintang officers and soldiers that if they continue to be obsessed and continue to do evil and poison the people, they will be severely punished without leniency.

This political offensive should be carried out under the unified leadership of the Party, mobilizing all forces. At the same time, it must also be combined with the work of striving to disintegrate Kuomintang officers and soldiers, closely combined with armed struggle, actively attack the enemy; cooperate with economic struggle, educate the masses not to smuggle, not to use Chiang Kai-shek-American goods, and expel enemy currency; and educate and organize the masses to actively support the front.

[Taihang, 2nd Dispatch] After the Kuomintang army's 39th Division, which was trapped in the isolated city of Anyang, fled south by air in early November, the remaining bandits were extremely panicked and shaken, and contracted their outlying strongholds. Yep County, located east of the Pinghan Railway, immediately seized the good opportunity to launch a strong political offensive against the enemy. Organize the masses to arm themselves for self-defense and disintegrate the enemy army. The political offensive progressed rapidly, extending to enemy-occupied areas more than ten miles southeast and north of the city, launching a large-scale propaganda offensive. The Second District convened 65 mass meetings, and the Third District convened meetings of 182 households of enemy soldiers' families. Various districts distributed propaganda materials, reaching 15 types and more than 3,000 copies. At the same time, mass anti-enemy self-defense struggles were launched in the guerrilla areas and even in the enemy-occupied areas. According to statistics from five districts, 148 villages have established armed self-defense organizations. This has greatly changed the situation of the county's struggle against the enemy, turning the original guerrilla area into a consolidated area, and the Chiang Kai-shek-occupied area into a guerrilla area or a marginal area. Villages in the marginal areas generally organized night watch teams, and some areas also established joint defense. The militia constantly took the initiative to attack, resisted the payment of grain and funds, and used indigenous weapons to drive away the harassing enemy troops in disguise, greatly pushing the focus of the struggle against the enemy forward. In more than ten days, two districts captured 20 scattered bandits who were conscripting soldiers and urging grain. The consolidated area villages are undergoing rectification and restoration and the establishment of democratic village political power, and production is proceeding relatively stably. Due to the development of the political offensive, great changes have taken place within the enemy. In four districts, 61 villages won over 135 bandits to surrender to us. In three districts, 95 households of landlords who had fled returned home to engage in production. This political offensive has gained two main experiences: (1) Mobilizing and organizing all village cadres and militiamen as the backbone of the political offensive, uniting the masses, giving play to the power of the political offensive, and at the same time, constantly helping them to correctly grasp the lenient policy of winning over enemy troops to surrender, preventing right-leaning thoughts such as unprincipled "coaxing" and "random guarantees," and maintaining high vigilance against false surrenders, resolutely annihilating and capturing those who attempt to hide their evil deeds and those who do not surrender. This had a great impact on the enemy army internally. (2) Mobilizing and organizing the families of enemy soldiers to consciously launch a "life-saving" movement of calling for their sons and demanding their husbands, accurately targeting the minds of the families of enemy soldiers. The county is now continuing to fully expand the results of the political offensive.

　　冀中十地委动员边缘各地
  　大力对敌展开政攻
    豫北深入宣传胜利瓦解土匪
    【冀中电】中共冀中十地委顷向大清河北各边缘县发出指示，号召各地抓紧目前有利时机，猛烈开展政治攻势。指示中首先详述了各个战场秋季攻势的伟大胜利。在华北，河北省会保定已经解放，平、津、太原解放在即。在各线胜利形势影响下，蒋傅匪军日益摇动。国民党河北省第三专区专员兼保安司令朱占魁已率部投诚。在此空前有利的形势下，地委特决定全分区党政军民一致动员，猛烈开展政治攻势。
    在宣传内容上，应着重：一、加强当前人民解放战争胜利形势的宣传，反复深入宣传中共中央负责人评中国军事形势，说明目前我军在质量，数量上均占优势，再有一年左右的时间，就可能把国民党反动政府从根本上打倒。宣传各战场秋季攻势中的伟大胜利，特别是东北全部解放后，东北解放军即将入关协同关内解放军作战，华北的全部解放已为期不远。二、进行我党我军宽大政策的宣传，说明朱占魁在我军强大攻势影响与宽大政策感召下率部投诚，给平津等地国民党军指出一条生路，号召国民党军官兵当机立断，起义、投诚或提早放下武器。如果继续顽抗只有死路一条。同时并宣传人民解放军总部征办战犯的命令，向国民党军官兵严格指出，如再执迷不悟，继续作恶，毒害人民，决严惩不贷。
    此次政攻应在党的一元化领导下，动员总力进行。同时，还必须结合争取瓦解国民党官兵的工作，密切结合武装斗争，积极打击敌人；配合经济斗争，教育群众不走私，不用蒋美货，驱逐敌币；并教育与组织群众积极支前。
    【太行二日电】困守安阳孤城的国民党军卅九师，十一月上旬空运南逃后，残留土匪异常惊慌与动摇，收缩外围据点。地处平汉路以东之邺县，立即抓紧良机，对敌开展强大政治攻势。组织群众武装自卫，瓦解敌军。政攻进展很快，纷纷伸向城东南、北十余里敌占区，发动了规模宏大的宣传攻势，二区曾召开了群众大会六十五次，三区并召开了一百八十二户的敌军家属会。各区散发了宣传品，达十五种，三千余份。同时开展了游击区以至敌占区群众性的抗敌自卫斗争。据五个区统计，已有一百四十八个村建立了武装自卫组织。使该县对敌斗争形势已起了很大转变，使原来的游击区变成巩固区，蒋占区变成游击区或边沿区。边沿区村庄普遍组织了打更队，有些地区并建立了联防。民兵不断的主动出击，抗交粮款，并用土武器打跑敌变衣队的袭扰，使对敌斗争的焦点大大推前一步。两个区十余天活捉抓丁催粮之零星匪军二十名。巩固区村庄进行整顿恢复与建立民主村政权，已比较安定的进行生产。由于政攻的开展，敌内部引起了大变化，四个区六十一个村争取土匪一百三十五人向我投诚。三个区有返家生产的逃亡地主九十五户。此次政攻获得两点主要经验：（一）发动与组织了所有村干民兵为政攻中的骨干，团结群众，发挥了政攻威力，同时不断具体帮助他们正确掌握争取敌军投诚的宽大政策，防止无原则的“拉拢”“乱保证”等右倾思想，并高度警惕假投诚，对妄图隐蔽作恶者不投诚者，坚决歼灭捕捉。这样对敌军内部震动很大。（二）发动与组织敌军家属自觉的展开叫子索夫的“救命”运动，打准了敌军家属的心思。该县现正继续全力扩展政攻成果。
