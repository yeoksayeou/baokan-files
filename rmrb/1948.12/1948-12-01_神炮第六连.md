　　Divine Cannon Sixth Company
    Shi Guang
    (I) Cannons Uphill
    The Battle for Naoma began. The Sixth Artillery Company was ordered to the front to coordinate with the infantry, but to reach their positions, they had to climb a high mountain for ×× li, with slopes so steep that even mules had difficulty traversing them. Although the infantry and laborers had made repairs, the loose soil meant every step sank. The No. 2 cannon carriage nearly reached the summit when it suddenly overturned. All the officers and soldiers of the company rushed to it and used all their strength to turn it over. After the No. 2 cannon carriage was up, the No. 3 cannon carriage fell into a gully with a seventy-degree slope, and the shaft horse almost fell into the mud ditch. The ××-jin cannon carriage kept rolling downwards. The carriage was heavy and the slope was steep, making it impossible to secure. The people pulling the cannon carriage had their hands torn, and those behind, carrying the wheels, were about to be crushed under the wheels. If they sank down, not only would the carriage be damaged, but the people and horses would be crushed to death. At this time it was 3 a.m., and one cannon was still at the bottom of the mountain. If it could not advance to the position by dawn, it would affect the entire combat mission. Everyone was sweating with anxiety. The company commander, in a moment of inspiration, dug two small pits in front of the wheels, gave a shout, and everyone pulled forward with one effort. The two wheels sank into the small pits and stopped. The whole company worked all night. When the horses couldn't pull, people pulled. When the backs of the carriers were injured, platoon leader Xie Baorong took their place. Comrade Zhang Cheng insisted on pulling the cannon even after his foot was crushed. Everyone was of one mind, and after untold hardships, dozens of cannons were pulled into position by dawn.
    (II) Every Shot a Hit
    "Every Shot a Hit" was the Sixth Company's slogan for meritorious service. Their first task was to hit the No. 1 Plum Blossom Bunker, a very strong steel and concrete structure. The enemy defended it with a regiment of soldiers and six or seven cannons, about two thousand meters from our artillery positions. Without destroying it, Naoma could not be captured. But because our artillerymen had trained hard and improved their aiming skills, the No. 3 cannon hit the entire bunker with its first shot, and the No. 2 cannon also hit the bunker, creating several large holes. The enemy guarding the bunker either died or fled. The next day, at dawn, they continued firing, and every shot hit. But when the first shot was fired, the point of impact was not visible. After a while, thick smoke was seen coming out of the bunker's loopholes. The enemy hurriedly fled, and it was realized that the cannonball had entered through the loopholes. Deputy Platoon Leader Liu Jian then directed the use of grapeshot to rout the routed soldiers and destroy the bunkers and enemy headquarters. Before long, two breakthrough points were opened up, and the infantry smoothly rushed up. In less than an hour, the Plum Blossom Bunker was completely occupied. Ammunition was well prepared, but because of "every shot a hit," less than a quarter was used to resolve the battle.
    (III) Brave and Tenacious
    After the enemy discovered our artillery, they immediately concentrated howitzers to fire wildly at our position. Cannonballs rained down on our position. More than a dozen fell in front of the cannon muzzles, and the forward edge of our fortifications was collapsing, and the command post shelter was also collapsing. But our company and platoon leaders remained calm as usual, calmly directing, and the gunners continued to fire, without any fear. The explosives chamber was destroyed, Wang Zhiping climbed out and repaired it immediately. Deputy Platoon Leader Li Mingpan was wounded but did not leave the line of fire. All the commanders and fighters bravely and tenaciously fought against the enemy's artillery. After we occupied the Naoma mountain ridge, the enemy organized five counterattacks in succession with two battalions of his so-called elite Thirtieth Division, but each time they were repelled by our Sixth Artillery Company's proactive and flexible coordination with the infantry. Comrade Li Zhendong, the second platoon leader, once found that the company commander was not present when the enemy counterattacked. He immediately reported to his superiors and ordered the artillery to fire, and only seventeen cannonballs scattered the enemy. This boosted the confidence of our infantry and consolidated the Naoma mountain ridge position. The infantry wrote to praise them for "shooting accurately and well!" Because of their meritorious service in coordinating with the infantry, the brigade party committee presented them with a banner with the inscription "Every Shot a Hit, worthy of the name Divine Cannon!"

　　神炮第六连
    石光
    （一）大炮上高山
    淖马争夺战开始了，炮兵六连奉命到阵地上去配合步兵作战，但他们进入阵地必须爬过一个××里地的高山，山坡斜度连毛驴都很难行走。虽然经过步兵民工修过，但因土质松软，仍然是一步一陷。二炮好容易快到山顶，忽地把车翻了，全连干部战士赶上去使尽全力才翻过来。二炮上了山，三炮又掉在一个七十多度的湾沿下了，辕马差点掉在泥沟里去。××斤重的炮车，一个劲儿的往下滚，车重坡陡，怎么也站不住。拉炮的人把手都拉破了，后面扛车轮的眼看着就要压在车轮下面，要是陷下去，不但要摔坏车，连人带马都要砸死。这时已到夜里三点，一个炮还在山下，拂晓前进不了阵地，就要影响整个战斗任务，那时人人急得满头大汗，连长急中生智，在炮轮前面挖了两个小坑，喊了一个口号，大家一鼓劲往前一拉，两个车轮陷在小坑里停住了。全连整熬了一夜，马拉不动时，人来拉，驮手背坏了，排长谢宝荣就代替，章诚同志把脚轧坏了还在坚持拉炮。大家一条心，千辛万苦，天快明时几十门大炮拉入阵地。
    （二）百发百中
    “百发百中”是六连的立功口号，他们第一个任务是打第一号梅花碉，这个大碉是钢骨水泥，很是坚强。敌人用一个团的兵力，六、七门大炮把守，距我们炮位两千米，不摧毁它，淖马就无法占领。但由于我们的炮兵平素苦练，瞄准技术提高了，三炮第一炮就打中了全碉，二炮也跟着命中碉堡，被打了几个大窟窿。守碉的敌人死的死了，跑的跑了，第二天拂哓继续射击，又是弹弹打中。但发第一发时，看不见着弹点，一会儿看见浓烟从碉堡的枪眼冒出来，敌人慌忙的向外逃窜，才知道炮弹从枪眼里打进去了。副排长刘剑，接着指挥用榴霰弹打溃兵，摧毁地堡和敌营指挥所，不多时开辟了两个突破点，步兵顺利的冲上了去，前后不到一小时，就完全占领了梅花碉。炮弹准备得很充足，但由于百发百中，只用了不到四分之一便解决了战斗。
    （三）勇敢顽强
    敌人发现我们炮兵后，立即集中榴弹炮向我阵地狂射，炮弹雨点般的落在我们阵地上。炮口前就落了十几发，我们的工事前沿都被打崩了，指挥所掩体也被打塌了，但我们的连排长们仍然镇静如常，沉着地指挥着，炮手们仍然射击着，大家没有一点畏惧的神色。炸药室被炸毁了，王志平钻出来马上修理好，副排长李明盘受伤不下火线，全体指战员英勇顽强对敌炮战，当我们占领淖马山梁后，敌人以他的所谓精锐三十师的两个营，先后组织了五次反扑，但每次都被我炮兵六连主动灵活配合步兵把敌人打退了。二排长李振堂同志，有一次连的首长不在，敌人反扑过来他就一面报告上级，一面叫炮兵打起来，只十七发炮弹把敌人打得七零八落。提高了我们步兵的信心，巩固了淖马山梁阵地。步兵来信赞扬他们“打的准，打的好！”由于他们配合步兵作战有功，旅党委会特赠他们奖旗一面，上面写着“百发百中，堪称神炮！”
