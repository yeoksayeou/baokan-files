　　Winter Schools Opened in Shen County, Jizhong
    Closely Combined with the Conclusion of Land Reform
  　Masses Welcome Lectures on Land Certificates
    [Our Newspaper] Shen County, combined with the conclusion of land reform and party rectification, has universally launched a winter school movement. According to incomplete statistics, 56 villages in the county have now organized people's schools, and 47 villages are in the process of organizing them. The main experiences of each village are introduced as follows:

    I. The branch is responsible for leadership, and party members take the lead actively. The Zhaili Village branch determined that the winter school would be led by the village branch's propaganda committee member, and primary school teachers and the education committee would be responsible for lecturing, combined with propaganda through the broadcasting station and blackboard newspaper, with very good results. Sixty-five people have attended the lectures. In Nandujiazhuang, Seventh District, a meeting of party members reviewed the reasons for the failure of organizing winter schools in the past, specifically discussed this year's methods of organizing people's schools, and called on party members to actively take the lead. Party member Zhang Yingliang first said: "I guarantee to bring five people to the people's school." Under his influence, party members all made plans. The next night, they indeed brought more than sixty people to participate in the people's school. All the party members of Dali Village, Seventh District, organized more than fifty people to attend the people's school, studying for two hours every night. After the masses dispersed, all the party members continued to study the party lesson for one hour.

    II. Combine with mass production. Use various production places to organize winter schools. There are ten pottery kilns in Wangliuzhuang, Seventh District. During the slack season, most of the people in the village go to the kilns to burn pottery. The district cadres went to the village and used the pottery kiln production site to organize winter schools, with each pottery kiln as a group and more than ten militiamen as a group. Each group selected one person who went to the primary school every afternoon, where the teacher was responsible for lecturing. In the evening, they returned to each group and unit to teach everyone. The masses responded very well to this "little teacher" system. Xiguxian Village, Fifth District, used places where people often went to rest in the oil mill to organize four study groups. Xuliu Village, Fourteenth District, used steamed bun shops, tofu shops, cooperatives, etc., to organize more than 80 people to participate in the study. Many other areas also used this kind of occasion to organize the masses to study.

    III. Use entertainment methods and resting places to guide the masses to participate in people's schools. Many people in the countryside like to listen to storytelling and watch operas. Some villages seize on the psychology of the masses and use this method to guide the masses to study. For example, Wang Luoshan's house in Cuijiazhuang, Third District, is a bachelor's hall, and there are always a dozen people chatting there every night. The village organized newspaper reading on this occasion. Qinghefang Village, Seventh District, used drum storytelling to gather the masses every night, so that more than 120 people participated every night. They told a story (Zhaili Village told the story of "Good Will Always Triumph Over Evil" published in the People's Daily), talked about policies and victory news. The masses responded by saying: "This is not bad, we listened to the story and also heard about the major national events." Liujiazhuang, Fifth District, used a troupe to organize more than 100 people's schools, using entertainment to drive the masses. It is good to do this in the early stages of organization, but it is necessary to cultivate backbones and activists, appropriately change the content according to the needs of the masses, and combine it with mass production in order to persist for a long time.

    IV. Teach according to the requirements and opinions of the masses. The people's school in Nandujiazhuang, Seventh District, had more than 40 people on the first night. The masses wanted to attend classes twice a day to save themselves the trouble of running around, so the comrades in charge of the winter school separated the classes into two the next night. The masses were very happy, and some even automatically called for people to come. The content of the teaching materials should also be based on the needs of the masses. For example, after the village talked about issuing land certificates, middle peasant Wu Luodai said: "What is being said is all facts. I feel confident in my heart after listening." He said to others, "Go and listen! What is being said is all serious things." As a result, more than 20 people were added the next night.

    V. In the organization, first find people who are most eager to learn, work well, and have a good style to be activists. The women in Cuijiazhuang automatically formed study groups, found two female teachers themselves, and stipulated mutual assistance, with those who know more characters teaching those who know fewer. Most of the women in this village could not spin, so the women's group in the east end found someone who could weave cloth to teach them. The young men's group was also afraid of falling behind and were secretly trying hard. These three study groups all have backbones. They are very enthusiastic and tense.

    A major feature of this year's organization of winter schools is that all localities are combining it with the central work of concluding land reform, issuing land certificates, etc., and explaining victory news and literacy education. This is suitable for the needs of the masses.

    In the organization of winter schools, some villages also took some detours. For example, in Dajia Village, First District, many people participated in the winter school on the first day, but because the comrade in charge did not grasp the urgent needs of the masses to speak about, but only spoke about the teaching materials in the winter school textbooks. As a result, some young people with higher education levels were unwilling to listen, and some people wanted to hear about the conclusion of land reform and the issuance of land certificates, but it was not discussed, so no one went the next day. In some villages in the Seventeenth District, the principle of voluntary participation by the masses was even violated, and even oil for lamps was fined for not attending three times. As a result of this coercive order, the masses felt that winter school was a burden. Although it was maintained for a while in form, it was ultimately bound to collapse.

　　冀中深县开办冬学
    密切结合结束土改
  　群众最欢迎讲土地证
    【本报讯】深县结合着结束土改与整党，已普遍展开冬学运动。据不完全的统计，现在全县已有五十六个村组织起了民校，四十七个村正在着手组织之中。兹把各村的主要经验介绍如下：
    一、支部负责领导，党员积极带头。寨里村支部确定冬学由村支部宣传委员负责领导，小学教师和教委负责讲解，并和广播台、黑板报的宣传结合起来，成绩很好。到校听讲的群众已有六十五人。七区南杜家庄，在党员会上检讨了过去组织冬学失败的原因，并具体讨论了今年组织民校的方法，号召党员积极带头。党员张英良首先说：“我保证带动五个群众上民校。”在他的影响下，党员们都作了计划。第二天晚上，果然就带动了六十多群众参加民校。七区大李村全体党员组织了五十多个群众上民校，每晚学习两点钟，群众散后，全体党员还继续学习一小时的党课。
    二、与群众生产结合。利用各种不同的生产场所组织冬学。七区王刘庄有十个盆窑，冬闲时该村群众大部都到窑上烧盆，区干部到村就以烧窑的生产场合组织冬学，每个盆窑为一小组，民兵十多人为一小组，各组各选出一个人，每天下午到小学校去，由教师负责讲，晚上回到各小组各单位教大家，这种小先生制，群众反映很好。五区西故显村利用油坊人们常去歇的地方，组织了四个学习小组。十四区许留村，利用蒸馍铺、豆腐坊、合作社等组织了八十多人参加了学习，其他地区利用这种场合组织群众学习的也很多。
    三、利用娱乐的方法及休息的场所，引导群众参加民校。乡村中很多老百姓喜欢听书、看戏。有的村抓住群众心理，以此种方法，引导群众学习。如三区崔家庄王洛山家，是个光棍堂，每天晚上总有十几个人在那闲谈，该村就在这个场合组织讲报。七区清河坊村，每晚利用说大鼓来召集群众，这样每晚有一百二十多群众参加，说一段书（寨里村是讲人民日报登的“邪不压正”的故事），讲一会政策和胜利消息，这样群众反映说：“这倒不错，听了书又听了国家大事。”五区柳家庄，利用剧团组织了一百多群众人民校，用娱乐带动群众，初期组织这样做是很好的，但必须培养骨干和积极分子，内容要根据群众的需要适当变更，并与群众生产相结合，才能长久坚持下去。
    四、根据群众要求按群众意见教学。七区南杜家庄民校，第一晚上四十多人，群众愿意分两头上课省得跑腿，冬学负责同志第二晚上就分开两头上课，群众很痛快，有的还自动叫人。教材的内容上，也要根据群众的需要。如该村讲了发土地证后，中农吴洛代说：“净讲的实事，听了心里就有了老底。”并对别人说：“听听去吧！净讲的正经事”。这样第二晚上便增加了二十多人。
    五、在组织中，先找要求学习最迫切，劳动好，作风也正派的人作积极分子，崔家庄妇女自动成立学习小组，自己找了两个女教员，规定互相帮助，识字多的教识字少的。这村妇女大多数不会纺织，东头妇女组并找出会织布的来教她们，男青年组也怕落了后，都在暗里使着劲，这三个学习小组，都有骨干。非常热烈紧张。
    今年组织冬学一个最大特点是各地都是与结束土改、发土地证等中心工作结合，并讲解胜利消息，与识字教育，这样是适合群众需要的。
    在组织冬校中，有的村也走了些弯路。如一区大贾村，第一天参加冬校的人不少，由于负责的同志没有抓住群众的迫切需要来讲，只是讲冬校课本上的教材。结果，一部分文化程度高的青年不愿听，一部群众想听结束土改发土地证的内容，可是没有讲，第二天就没有什么人去了。十七区有的村，甚至违犯了群众自愿的原则，还有订出三次不去就罚灯油的。这样强迫命令的结果，使群众觉得冬学是一种负担，形式上虽维持一时，而终难免垮台。
