　　After Land Reform, Masses Welcome Superior Crop Varieties
  　Northern Yue Promotes 50,000 Jin of "72" Wheat Seeds
    [Northern Yue News] Northern Yue promoted over 50,000 jin of the "72" wheat variety, spreading it to twelve counties in the fourth and fifth special districts, covering over 4,000 mu. Due to the liberation of the masses' productive forces after the land reform, the people urgently need superior varieties and improved techniques. Therefore, the "72" wheat seed has been warmly welcomed by the masses, and each county feels that the "supply falls short of demand."
    During the promotion, thanks to the efforts and in-depth mobilization of the cadres, the task was quickly completed, and the following experiences were gained for reference by various regions:
    (1) When promoting new varieties, it is important to clearly introduce both the advantages and disadvantages, as well as how to adapt to and overcome the disadvantages while leveraging the advantages. This will allow the masses to become familiar with and understand the planting methods, thereby transforming their conservative awareness. Simply saying good things and not mentioning the bad, a purely "hiding the bad and publicizing the good" promotion method, is unacceptable.
    (2) Use physical objects for comparison, and use key examples to drive general adoption. "Seeing is believing, hearing is deceiving," "seeing once is better than hearing a hundred times" - this leaves a deep impression on the masses. Therefore, empty words are not as good as showing the masses physical objects for evaluation and comparison. For example, cadres in Zhengding County brought a bag of seeds when they went to the countryside; the party branch secretary of Zhancun in the third district, seeing the strength of the seeds, bought a斗 (dou, a unit of dry measure) of wheat in the market and exchanged it early. Many counties and districts in the fourth special district paid attention to focusing on key villages for promotion, which played a significant role.
    (3) Combine individual mobilization with broad publicity. First mobilize cadres and active members of the masses who are receptive to new scientific technologies to play a pioneering and leading role, and introduce the circumstances of neighboring villages changing their seeds to provide inspiration and stimulation. This is an effective way to promote adoption. For example, the cadres of Jiazhuang in Xingtang, and Beiyangma Village and Xiyangping Village in Quyang all played a leading role.
    (4) Specific accounting to dispel concerns: Because the masses believe that the "72" wheat variety produces less straw, we should promote the fact that the "72" wheat variety has strong disease resistance and high yield to dispel their concerns.
    Finally, all levels must check whether the "72" wheat seeds promoted this year have been completely sown and the germination situation, in order to achieve the goal of gradual promotion and increased production year by year.

### 土改后群众欢迎优良农产品种　北岳推广“七二”麦种五万斤

　　土改后群众欢迎优良农产品种
  　北岳推广“七二”麦种五万斤
    【北岳讯】北岳推广“七二”号麦种五万余斤，推广到四、五专区十二个县，共种四千余亩。由于土改后群众生产力解放，群众迫切需要优良品种，改进技术；因之，“七二”麦种获得群众热烈欢迎，各县都有“供不应求”之感。
    推广时，由于干部的努力与深入动员，迅速完成了任务，并获得以下经验供各地参考：
    （一）推广新品种时，强调将其优点和缺点鲜明的分别介绍，及如何适应和克服其缺点，发挥其特点，使群众熟悉与领会种植法，方能转变群众的保守意识。光说好不说坏，单纯的“隐恶扬善”的推广方法，是要不得的。
    （二）用实物作比较，以重点带一般。“眼见是实，耳听是虚”“百闻不如一见”，这在群众中的印象是很深的。因此空口宣传不如拿实物给群众作评判和比较为好，如正定县干部下乡，都带着一包种子；三区占村支书，看到种子强，在市上买了一斗小麦，即及早交换了。四专不少县、区都注意了掌握重点村进行推广，起了不少作用。
    （三）个别动员与广泛宣传相结合。应先动员干部及接受新科学技术的积极群众，起先锋带头作用，及介绍邻村换种的情形，予以启示和刺激，是推广有效的办法。如行唐贾庄、曲阳北羊马村、西羊平等村干都起了带动作用。
    （四）具体算帐解除顾虑：由于群众对“七二”号麦认为出面少，而我们应宣传“七二”号麦抗病力强，产量高，以消除其顾虑。
    最后各级必须检查今年推广的“七二”号麦种是否完全播种上以及出苗情形等，以达逐年推广和增产的目的。
