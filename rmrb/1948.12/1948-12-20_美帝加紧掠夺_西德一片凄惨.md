Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, December 17th: As US imperialism implements the "Marshall Plan-ization" of West Germany, the lives of the West German people are rapidly deteriorating. According to the German News Agency, as a result of inflation, the German state banks can no longer control currency circulation. No one knows the exact amount of Mark circulation. The German state banks say it is 11 billion, while the Americans say it is 14 billion. No one knows how many West German Marks printed in the United States have not been handed over to the German state banks and are circulating illegally in West Germany. It is also worth noting that American banks are openly exchanging West German Marks at a rate of 5 to 7 US cents per Mark (the official rate is 30 cents).

While the US and British governments are intensifying their financial plunder of West Germany, the food situation in West Germany is also becoming increasingly difficult. According to the German News Agency, in the spring of 1949, the grain supply for the Germans will be short by 400,000 tons. The head of the US military government supply office in Hesse stated that if farmers do not increase their deliveries, the bread ration in Hesse will be reduced by four kilograms per person per month. The deputy director of the US military government in Bavaria, Bauer, also stated that next spring, the food ration for the German people will be reduced by 250 calories. In addition, officials in the West German joint occupation zone announced on the 13th that the number of unemployed in the zone has risen to 700,000. These figures do not include workers who only work part-time, who are in fact unemployed because the wages they receive are very small and insufficient to support themselves and their families.

In discussing the economic situation in West Germany, the Soviet Labor Newspaper pointed out on the 7th that the reduction in the amount of currency in the hands of the West German people and the reduction in wages have created a situation in which the working people are often unable to buy their rations with their income. According to the intentions of the authors of the "Marshall Plan," West Germany is to serve as a springboard for American expansionism in the "Marshallized" European state system. For this purpose, West Germany's war potential is being rapidly restored, which is the first result of the Marshall Plan being applied to West Germany. No wonder this plan has also produced another result—namely, the growing dissatisfaction among the working people. The German working class is becoming increasingly familiar with the dangers of US and British policies. Demonstrations and strikes in West Germany clearly express the dissatisfaction and protest of the German masses.

### 美帝加紧掠夺　西德一片凄惨

　　美帝加紧掠夺
  　西德一片凄惨
    【新华社陕北十七日电】在美帝国主义将西部德国实行“马歇尔计划化”的过程中，西德人民的生活正迅速恶化。据德意志通讯社称，由于通货膨胀的结果，德国州银行已不能再控制通货流通。马克流通量的确数究竟有多少，谁也不知道。德国州银行说是一百一十亿，美国人则说是一百四十亿。在美国印制的西德马克，究竟有多少未交给德国州银行而迳直在西德非法流通，是没有人知道的。而且值得注意的，是美国银行正公开以五分到七分美金比一马克的兑换率（官价是三角）在换取西德马克。与美英政府加紧对西德实行财政掠夺的同时，西德粮食情况，也日趋困难。据德意志通讯社称，一九四九年春天，供给德人的粮食，将短少四十万吨。黑森州美国军政府供应处长谈称，如果农民不增加缴纳，则黑森州的面包配给数每人每月将减少四公斤。又据巴伐利亚美军政府副主任包尔德谈称，明年春天，德国人民的食粮配给将削减二百五十卡洛里。此外，西德联合占领区官方十三日宣布：联占区失业人数已高涨至七十万。这些数字中还并不包括仅有部分时间工作的工人，他们事实上是失业的，因为他们所得到的薪资十分微小，不足以维护他们和他们家庭的生活。
    在论及西德的经济情势时，苏联劳动报于七日指出：西德人民手中货币数量的减少和工资的降低，已造成这种局势，即劳动人民已常常不能以其所得购买他们的口粮。按照“马歇尔计划”作者的打算，西德在“马歇尔化的”欧洲国家系统中，要担任美国扩张主义之跳板的角色。为了这一目的。西德战争潜力正被迅速恢复，这是马歇尔计划应用于西德的第一个结果。无怪这一计划也产生了另外的结果——即劳动人民方面已逐渐增长其不满。德国工人阶级正越来越熟悉美英政策的危害性。西德的示威和罢工，明白地表示了德国人民大众的不满和抗议。
