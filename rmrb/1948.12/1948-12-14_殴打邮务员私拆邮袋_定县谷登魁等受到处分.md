    Beating Postal Workers and Illegally Opening Mailbags
    Gu Dengkui and Others in Ding County Punished
    [Our Newspaper] In July, Liu Chunhui, a postal worker from the Quyang Post Office in the Beiyue District, was driving a large cart to deliver mail when he passed through Xipan Village in Ding County. Gu Dengkui, Zhang Dongfu, Gu Shenglai, and two others (who were members of the anti-smuggling team) stopped him with guns to inspect the mail. The postal worker refused, and a conflict ensued. Gu and the others beat the postal worker and illegally opened the mailbags. After the post office reported this to the North China People's Government, it was deemed that illegally opening mailbags violated postal regulations and that beating postal workers was not permitted under the laws of our democratic government. The local government was immediately ordered to investigate and deal with the matter. Gu Dengkui and Zhang Dongfu were detained in the county. It has now been decided to handle the matter as follows: those who participated in this anti-smuggling action will be given a demotion. Those who beat the postal worker will be educated and punished. As for certain chaotic phenomena in anti-smuggling work, the local government is also strengthening rectification. (Tao Wei)

    殴打邮务员私拆邮袋
    定县谷登魁等受到处分
    【本报讯】七月间，北岳区曲阳邮局邮务员刘春惠赶着一辆大车送邮件，路过定县西潘村，当即有谷登魁、张东福、谷胜来等四人（是缉私组的），拿着枪要检查，邮务员不让查，遂发生冲突，谷等竟将邮务员殴打一顿，并私拆邮袋。经邮局反映到华北人民政府后，以私拆邮袋，有违邮章，殴打邮务员，亦为我民主政府法令所不许，当即令当地政府调查处理，将谷登魁、张东福扣押到县，现决定按以下办法处理：参加这次缉私的，给以撤职处分，打人的予以教育和处分。至于缉私中的某些混乱现象，当地政府亦正在加强整顿中。（陶伟）
