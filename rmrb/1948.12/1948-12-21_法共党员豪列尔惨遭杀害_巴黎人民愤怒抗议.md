Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, December 19th. TASS, Paris, December 14th: French Communist Party member André Hauer was shot and killed by police on the morning of the 13th in the Parisian suburb of Saint-Mandé while posting anti-war slogans. The news immediately aroused deep anger and a wave of protests from the French working people and all democratic elements. Throughout the 13th, rallies were held in many enterprises in Paris, where the working people passed resolutions protesting police terror. Duclos, leader of the Communist parliamentary group, submitted a question to the National Assembly, describing the scene of Hauer, who had participated in two world wars, being shot by the police. Many French trade unions and democratic groups also protested. The Executive Committee of the Paris Regional Trade Union Federation called on all working people to participate in Hauer's funeral. In a resolution, the National Executive Committee of the Republican Youth League pointed out that this murder was not accidental, but the logical result of the government's anti-working class and anti-democratic policies. The Executive Committee called on French youth to continue to fight for peace and against the freedom of warmongers. A veterans' organization stated in an open letter to the people that the government should be held responsible for creating an atmosphere like that of the Fascist occupation. Delegations of many working people went to the French Ministry of the Interior to protest to the Minister of the Interior. A delegation of Communist Party members met with the Paris Police Commissioner to protest Hauer's murder and demand that the murderers be punished. The Seine Provincial Committee of the Communist Party held a protest rally attended by more than 4,000 people. The resolution passed at the meeting stated: "Hauer is a victim of the orders issued by the government and its Socialist Minister of the Interior, Moch, to the police. Their actions are clear evidence of their fear in the face of the growth and consolidation of the people, the alliance of all republicans, and the just demands of the Communist Party fighting for peace and freedom."

　　法共党员豪列尔惨遭杀害
    巴黎人民愤怒抗议
    【新华社陕北十九日电】塔斯社巴黎十四日讯：法国共产党员安德烈·豪列尔，十三日晨在巴黎市郊圣蒙多张贴反战标语时被警察杀害。消息传出后，立即引起了法国劳动人民和一切民主分子的深沉愤怒和抗议浪潮。十三日全天，巴黎许多企业中曾举行大会，劳动人民在会上通过了抗议警察恐怖的决议。共产党议会党团领袖杜克洛向国民议会提出质问案，描述曾参加过两次大战的豪列尔被警察枪杀的情形。法国许多职工会和民主团体也提出抗议。巴黎区职工会联合执委会号召一切劳动人民参加豪列尔的葬仪。共和青年联盟全国执委会在决议中指出：这一杀害不是偶然的，它是政府反工人阶级、反民主政策的逻辑结果。执委会号召法国青年继续为争取和平及反对战争煽动者的自由而战斗。退伍军人组织在告人民书中指出：政府应负造成类如法西斯占领时期的那种空气的责任。许多劳动人民的代表团到法国内政部，向内政部长提出抗议。共产党议员代表团曾往见巴黎警察总监，抗议豪列尔的被害，并要求惩处杀人犯。塞纳省共产党举行抗议大会，参加者达四千余人。会上通过的决议称：“豪列尔是政府和它的社会党内政部长摩许向警察所发的命令的牺牲者。他们的行动，是他们在人民、在一切共和分子的联盟的成长与巩固、在为和平与自由而战的共产党的正义要求前面害怕的明证。”
