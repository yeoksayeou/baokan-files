　　Lessons from the Price Fluctuations of Iron in Yangquan City

　　　　Fluctuation Situation

　　In November, the price of iron goods in Yangquan City experienced a shocking fluctuation. According to an experienced iron furnace operator, this was the second major fluctuation since the Republic of China. He worriedly said, "The price has risen too much, and the furnace makers have no confidence." In total, within a month, the price of tobacco pipes increased by 210% per load, Sichuan pots by 200% per load, and small Yangquan goods by 250% per load. On the 29th of last month, the price of tobacco pipes soared from 350 yuan (new currency, same below) to 420 yuan per load in a single day. The price difference between other living materials and iron goods was very large, with millet rising by 127%, homespun cloth by 162%, while oil and salt showed a downward trend. The rising trend spread to the countryside, and various furnaces competed to purchase raw materials, leading to an increase in the prices of iron ore, coal, and transportation costs. Iron goods producers who sold their goods today might not be able to buy raw materials tomorrow. The cost of iron furnaces was difficult to calculate, posing a significant crisis for iron industry production. Because grain prices could not keep up with the rise in iron goods, consumers were also directly harmed.

　　　　Reasons for Fluctuation

　　The objective reason for this iron price fluctuation was the victory of the People's Liberation Army's autumn offensive on various major battlefields, and the gradual recovery of water and land transportation. Due to the wide sales channels, iron merchants and some public-owned stores and cooperatives from various places gathered in Yangquan to compete for iron goods. However, the production area was very small, and the production method was decentralized and backward, using traditional methods, so the production quantity could not keep up with market demand. Under this situation of unhindered sales and supply falling short of demand, price increases were in line with normal laws. However, with good leadership, the drastic fluctuations in iron prices could have been avoided.

　　However, Baoxingheng Coal and Iron General Store in Yangquan made principled mistakes in grasping price policies and uniting small producers in this new objective environment. After the rainy season this autumn, Baoxingheng signed contracts with various worker cooperative furnaces, joint-stock furnaces, and cooperative furnaces, pre-ordering 2.9 million yuan worth of iron goods, using the method of advance payment before delivery to help the iron furnaces solve the financial difficulties of starting the furnace. However, shortly after the furnace started, the Taiyuan Campaign began. Due to the large number of civilian workers going to the front lines, the output of [sand?] decreased, and transportation capacity was lacking. The prices of [sand?], coal, and transportation all increased, and many iron furnaces had insufficient capital turnover, and the pre-ordered empty goods could not be delivered on time. At that time, they requested Baoxingheng to continue pre-ordering a batch of goods to carry out reproduction; at this time, Baoxingheng only recovered one-third of the original order. Because they were worried that the 2 million yuan order could not be recovered, they did not dare to continue ordering goods, and decided indiscriminately that "no more orders will be continued for those who cannot deliver the old orders." When receiving goods with cash, they were afraid that the price would rise too high and the difference from the original order price would be too large, so they could not recover the goods. Therefore, the purchase price often could not catch up with the iron goods prices of merchants. This method of suppressing prices, which deviated from the normal laws of the market, was equivalent to sending the vast number of small producers (iron furnaces) into the arms of speculative merchants. Speculative merchants were taking advantage of the weakness of small producers and Baoxingheng.

　　In mid-November, Baoxingheng reviewed the above-mentioned errors, and then convened a symposium of iron furnace operators, reviewed the errors of both parties in the price fluctuations during this period, and decided to solve the actual difficulties for the iron furnaces based on the business policy of "supporting production and developing cooperative undertakings." It was decided that the old orders should adhere to the contract but could be delivered in installments, and use the method of continuing to order goods and pre-lending money to help the iron furnaces. It was announced that in the future, it would be "purchasing finished products at prices higher than the market price, and supplying living materials at prices lower than the market price" (later reviews emphasized that it was problematic to emphasize high prices for finished products to furnace operators), and regular pricing methods were stipulated. After the meeting, the amount of iron goods received increased greatly. However, Jinzhong Coal and Iron Store (under the leadership of Shijiazhuang Trading Company) and other public-owned stores and cooperatives from other places, as well as speculative merchants, continued to raise prices in order to acquire more finished products; and Baoxingheng only mechanically implemented the regulations for purchasing finished products at prices higher than the market price (in fact, there was no formal market price): small producers blindly pursued profits, and ran wherever the price was high, so the entire market was in a state of serious chaos. What was even more erroneous was that Baoxingheng did not deeply study the specific situation of the market, and did not understand and grasp the activities of foreign merchants and the situation in foreign markets, such as their relationship with private merchants, the amount of circulating funds for them and private merchants, the sales prices in Xingtai, Handan, Dezhou, etc., the purchasing power of the masses, and the changes in the cost of iron furnaces, etc. Instead, they subjectively imagined that the production area of iron goods was small, the sales were large, and the supply was less than the demand, so prices would definitely rise. Therefore, they took a shrinking and cautious approach of increasing prices by one level a day, and did not dare to increase the price to a considerable extent at one time, so they seized the initiative, received a large number of goods, and achieved the goal of stabilizing iron prices. In addition, they did not clarify how large the market price was, and only heard that the market had a price of 420 yuan (in fact, this was not a formal market price), so on the 29th, they blindly increased the price of each load of tobacco pipes from 350 yuan to 420 yuan, creating greater chaos in the market. This practice added fuel to the fire for price fluctuations. And the store did not consult with the Municipal Committee and the General Company before making this sudden price increase decision.

　　Another main reason was the narrow departmentalism of some public-owned, agency-managed, and public-private joint-venture stores and cooperative unions, who did not consider the overall situation and engaged in speculative business. They lived in iron goods warehouses and competed for finished products, and even formed a line with speculative merchants to compete with Baoxingheng Coal and Iron Store. In particular, Shijiazhuang Jinzhong Coal and Iron Store used its huge funds, in addition to directly competing for purchases, and entrusted Sanyi Store, Yonghelong, Fulong Store and other private iron goods warehouses to purchase on its behalf. According to the investigation, the working capital of the nine public-owned stores greatly exceeded the total purchasing power of private merchants, and some of the merchants' funds were borrowed from banks in various places. Therefore, the main factor in this surge in iron prices was the competition among various public-owned stores. In addition, the Yangquan Municipal Party and government organs did not fully grasp the situation before the major fluctuations, Baoxingheng did not promptly report the price fluctuations to the Municipal Party Committee, and the government's industrial and commercial departments did not adequately control speculative merchants, all of which were some of the reasons for the major price fluctuations.

　　　　Our Measures

　　Zhengtai Coal and Iron Company discovered this error and immediately pointed out that this surge in iron goods was blind and ordered Baoxingheng Coal and Iron General Store to temporarily stop purchasing iron goods. At the same time, the Yangquan Municipal Party and government organs actively investigated and studied various situations, and learned that this price fluctuation had a short duration and had not yet affected other cities except Shizhuang; the main competitors in the market were nine public-owned stores, cooperatives, and public-private joint-venture stores. Therefore, it was decided that: (1) First, rectify the economic front and hold a symposium for public-owned stores. Severely criticize the anarchic and undisciplined speculative behavior of some public-owned stores. And it was decided that the nine stores would temporarily stop purchasing goods directly from the market during the period of major price fluctuations. (2) Baoxingheng General Store also temporarily stopped purchasing iron goods, so that the fluctuation surface of iron prices could be reduced, and the prices of iron ore, coal, and transportation could tend to stabilize, allowing the price of iron goods to fall naturally. (3) Convene a meeting of furnace operator representatives to explain the reasons for the price fluctuations and their harm to small producers, and explain to them that Baoxingheng would help solve the real difficulties of the iron furnaces during the suspension of purchases. And request the government, banks, and other departments to cooperate in this work and strictly control speculative merchants.

　　　　Two Problems to be Solved

　　Based on the characteristics of Yangquan, there are two more problems that need to be solved:

　　First, iron goods are local specialties. The iron industry in Yangquan not only undertakes the manufacture of civilian iron goods, but also regularly undertakes certain tasks of national economic construction. However, due to the limitations of technology and equipment, production cannot be increased more. Especially as the liberated areas are rapidly expanding, the phenomenon of supply falling short of demand will become more serious. If it is not handled well, prices will inevitably fluctuate. Therefore, the entire iron goods production needs to be carried out in a more planned and organized manner. Baoxingheng should take on this task and cooperate with other public-owned stores to take consistent steps to stabilize prices so that speculative merchants have no loopholes to exploit, and production can develop normally.

　　Second, the iron furnaces in Yangquan and Puding are operated by small producers in the form of labor-capital cooperation and labor cooperation, scattered in more than 100 villages. Most of them were established by Baoxingheng Coal and Iron General Store, and have established close relationships with each other; however, these unorganized small producers are quite complex internally. Some of them have many years of contact with old operators and speculative merchants, and are very likely to leave our state-owned stores during price fluctuations and blindly and unlimitedly pursue profits with speculative merchants. Therefore, in order to further support and unite small producers, there must be strong and correct leadership, and small producers must be continuously educated to gradually organize them within the scope of cooperative economy. Yangquan City is trying and studying these issues.

　　阳泉市铁价波动的教训
            波动情况
    十一月份阳泉市的铁货价格发生了一次惊人的波动，据一个较有经验的铁炉经营人员说，这是民国以来的第二次大波动。他很担忧的说：“涨的过火了，做炉的没有底。”总共在一个月内烟锅每驮上涨为百分之二百一十，川锅每驮上涨为百分之二百，泉小货每驮上涨为百分之二百五十。上月廿九日一天每驮烟锅由三百五十元（新币，下同）暴涨至四百廿元。其他生活资料和铁货价格相差很远，计小米涨到百分之一百二十七，土布涨到百分之一百六十二，油盐反呈下跌之势。涨风波及乡村，各炉争购原料，致铁＠石、炭、运费都跟着上升。铁货生产者，今天卖了货，明天就可能买不到原料，铁炉的成本很难计算，给铁业生产潜伏了一个重要的危机，因粮价追不上铁货的上涨，也直接地损害了消费者。
    　　　　波动原因
    此次铁价的波动，客观原因是人民解放军秋季攻势在各个主要战场上的胜利，水陆交通逐渐恢复。由于销路的广阔，各地铁商与一部分公营商店、合作社，云集阳泉，争购铁货，而生产的地区很小，生产的方法又是分散落后的土法制造，生产的数量赶不上市场的需要。在这种畅销无阻、供不应求的情况下，物价上涨是合乎正常规律的，但如果领导得好，铁价的剧烈波动是可以避免的。
    但阳泉宝兴亨煤铁总店，却在这种新的客观环境中，掌握物价政策与团结小生产者上犯了原则性的错误：今秋雨季过后，宝兴亨曾和各工人合作炉、合股炉与合作社炉订立合同，预定了二百九十万元的铁货，用先支款后交货的办法帮助铁炉解决开炉的资金困难。但开炉不久太原战役开始，因大批民工到前方参战，＠砂产量减少，运输力缺乏，＠、炭、运费都涨了价，很多铁炉资金周转不灵，预定的空货没有能按期交回。当时要求宝兴亨继续预定一批货，以进行再生产；这时宝兴亨只收回了原定货的三分之一，因担心二百多万元的定货不能收回，不敢继续再定货，便不加分别地决定“交不起旧定货一律不再继续定货”。用现款收货时又怕价格涨高与原定货价悬殊，收不回货来，所以买价常是赶不上商人的铁货价格。这种脱离市场正常规律的压价办法，等于把广大小生产者（铁炉），送到投机商人怀抱之中，投机商人正利用了小生产者与宝兴亨这个弱点。
    十一月中旬宝兴亨检讨了上述错误，于是召开了铁炉座谈会，检讨了这一时期物价波动中双方的错误，根据“扶植生产发展合作事业”的经营方针给铁炉解决实际困难，决定旧定货要坚持合同但可分期交纳，并用继续定货与预借款的办法帮助铁炉，宣布今后是“高于市价收购成品，低于市价供给生活资料”（后来检讨对炉户强调高价收买成品，这种说法是有毛病的），并规定了定期议价办法。会后收到铁货数量大增。但晋中煤铁店（属石家庄贸易公司领导）及其他外处公营商店合作社与投机商人，为了更多地收购成品，继续不断地提高价格；而宝兴亨只顾机械地实行高于市价收购成品的规定（事实上市场已无正式行市）：小生产者又盲目地追逐利润，哪边价高往哪边跑，整个市场遂处于严重的混乱状态。更错误的是宝兴亨没有深入研究市场的具体情况，没有了解和掌握外商的活动及外市情形，如他们和私商的关系如何，他们及私商的周转资金有多大，邢台、邯郸、德州等地的销售价格如何，群众有多大购买力，铁炉成本有何变化等等。而只是主观地想象铁货产地小，销路大，供不应求一定会涨价。于是缩手缩脚地采取一天一涨的办法，而不敢一次涨到相当程度，就此把主动权掌握过来，收到大批货物，以达到稳定铁价。加上没有闹清市价究竟有多大，只风闻市场有四百二十元的价格（其实这并非正式行市），于是在二十九号又盲目的把每驮烟锅由三百五十元暴涨至四百二十元，造成了市场更大的混乱。这种做法对于价格波动起了火上加油的作用。而这个突然涨价的决定，该店事先并没有向市委会与总公司请示。
    另一个主要原因，是一部分公营、机关经营、公私合营的商店及合作联合社狭隘的本位主义，不顾大局做投机生意，他们住在铁货栈房争夺成品，甚至和投机商人拉成一条线来和宝兴亨煤铁店争购。特别是石家庄晋中煤铁店更利用自己的庞大资金，除自己直接争购外，并委托三义栈、永合隆、福隆栈等私营铁货栈房代为收购。根据调查，九家公营性质的商店的活动资金，大大超过了私商的总购买力，且商人的一部分资金又是从各地银行贷到的，所以这次铁价暴涨起主要作用的还是各个公营商店的争购。此外，阳泉市党政机关在大波动之前，没有全面掌握情况、宝兴亨对物价波动没有及时向市委报名，政府工商部门对投机商人管制不够，都是此次的物价大波动的一些原因。
    　　　　我们的措施
    正太煤铁公司发现这个错误，立时指出此次铁货的跃涨是盲目的，命令宝兴亨煤铁总店暂时停止收购铁货。同时阳泉市党政机关积极调查研究各种情况，了解到这次物价波动时间较短，除石庄外，其他城市尚未受到影响；市场争购者主要是九家公营商店、合作社及公私合营的商店。因此决定：（一）首先严整经济阵营，召开公营商店座谈会。严厉批评某些公营商店的无政府无纪律的投机行为。并决定该九家商店在物价大波动时期暂时停止向市场直接购货。（二）宝兴亨总店亦暂时停止收购铁货，使铁价波动面缩小、铁＠、炭、运费等价格趋于平稳，让铁货价格自然下跌。（三）召开炉户代表会说明此次物价波动的原因，及其对小生产者的危害，并向他们说明，暂停收货过程中铁炉真有困难宝兴亨帮助解决。并请政府、银行等各部分亦配合这一工作，严格管制投机商人。
    　　　　尚需解决的两个问题
    根据阳泉的特点，还有两个问题需要解决：
    第一、铁货是当地特产，阳泉的铁业不但担负着民用铁货的制造，而且经常负担着国家经济建设的一定任务，但由于技术与设备的限制，不能更多的增加产量。特别是在解放区正在迅速扩大，故供不应求的现象会更严重。如掌握不好，物价必然波动。因此对于整个铁货生产需要更加有计划有组织地进行。宝兴亨应担负起这一任务，并协同其他公营商店采取一致的步调，稳定物价，使投机商人无空可钻，生产才能得到正常发展。
    第二、阳泉平定的铁炉，是小生产者用劳资合作与劳力合作的形式经营着，分散在一百多个村庄，大部分是由宝兴亨煤铁总店扶植起来的，互相建立了密切的关系；但这些没有组织的小生产者，内部相当复杂，其中有一部分与旧的经营人员和投机商人有着多年的联系，每在物价波动时，很容易离开我们的国营商店，而跟着投机商人盲目无限制地追逐利润。因此为进一步地扶植与团结小生产者，必须有坚强正确的领导，对小生产者必须进行不断的教育，以逐渐把他们组织在合作经济范围之内，阳泉市正在试行与研究这些问题。
