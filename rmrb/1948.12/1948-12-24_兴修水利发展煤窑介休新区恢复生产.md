[Jinzhong Telegram] In order to ensure that both production and support for the front are not delayed, the Jiexiu New District is now seizing the gaps in support work to actively organize production.

In terms of water conservancy construction: the county has established the Fen River Water Conservancy Committee and started construction on the Yongji and Tianshun Canal embankments. According to the policy of building water conservancy projects to eliminate water hazards, the Fen River Water Conservancy Cadre Meeting was first convened on November 16 to conduct preliminary research on the Fen River water conservancy. On the 18th, a Fen River Water Conservancy Meeting was held in Yian Village, gathering representatives from 25 villages along the Fen River to specifically discuss the issue of expanding irrigated land area by repairing canals. It was decided that the Yongji and Tianshun Canal embankments would be repaired this winter. The Yongji and Tianshun Canals are located on the north and south banks of the Fen River, respectively. The section to be repaired this winter stretches from Sanlang Village in Pingyao in the east to the Jiexiu Saltworks in the west, covering a distance of more than twenty miles. The Fen River Water Conservancy Committee was officially established on November 20, and construction officially began on the 22nd of last month, striving to complete the canal embankments before the hard freeze (Winter Solstice). If water can be diverted into the canals before the Qingming Festival next spring, it is estimated that in addition to the original 30,000 mu of irrigated land, the irrigated area can be further expanded by 70,000 mu. In addition, the masses in Zhanglan Town have built the Zhangtun Canal, which is about twelve li long and can divert water from Hongshan (Paoshui River) into the canal; it was officially put into use on November 30, and it is estimated that it can irrigate 20 qing of alfalfa and wheat.

In terms of supporting and developing coal mines: Since the liberation of the county, the new district's coal mines have undergone new development. With the support of loans from the Industrial and Commercial Bureau, the number of coal mines in Wangcun, Baian, Guobi, Yitang and other four villages in the Fifth District has increased from thirteen to twenty-three, and the daily output of coal from large and small kilns is 3,300 baskets (200 jin per basket), which are selling quickly. The number of workers has increased from 300 to 1,300. At the same time, workers' wages have also gradually increased.

In order to systematically increase the number of livestock owned by farmers and facilitate livestock trading, the old "tooth guilds" (brokers), who profited by taking "over-water fees" (meaning taking advantage of the situation), were gradually abolished. On November 25, Jiexiu convened a meeting of the tooth guilds in the town's mule and horse market, mainly focusing on breaking through ideological barriers and eliminating everyone's feudal habits, and proposed prohibiting trading practices such as "secret code negotiations" (black market). All buying and selling must be done with open price negotiations. At the same time, the old title of "tooth guild" was abolished and renamed "Livestock Trader."

In supporting the cotton weaving industry, in addition to establishing a cotton weaving industry union in the town area, loans of more than 250,000 yuan have been provided. There are now 17 rotary knitting machines, 14 iron machines, and 12 wooden machines. Rotary knitting machines can produce 85 dozens of finished products per day, while iron and wooden machines can produce 54 bolts of cloth. In order to supply raw materials, the cotton industry union has sent special personnel to contact the Yuci Yarn Factory to specifically resolve the difficulty of supplying cotton yarn.

　　兴修水利发展煤窑介休新区恢复生产
    【晋中电】为了使生产、支前两不误，介休新区现正抓紧支前空隙积极组织生产。在兴办水利方面：该县已成立汾河水利委员会开工修筑永济、天顺二渠堰。根据兴修水利铲除水害方针，于十一月十六日首先召开汾河水利干部会议，初步研究汾河水利。十八日复于义安村召集汾河沿岸二十五村汾河水利会议，具体商讨修渠扩大水浇地面积问题。经决议，今冬首先修永济、天顺二渠堰。按永济、天顺渠位于汾河两岸南北各一。今冬修渠段，东起平遥三浪村，西至介休盐场，长达二十余里。自十一月二十日正式成立汾河水利委员会，于上月二十二日正式开工修渠，争取渠堰在实冻（冬至）前竣工。明春清明节前，如能引水入渠，预计除原有灌溉田三万亩外，更可扩大水浇面积七万亩。此外，张兰镇群众已修成长约十二里的张屯渠，可引洪山（抛河水）入渠；已于十一月三十日正式用水，估计可灌溉蓿麦二十顷。在扶植发展煤窑方面：自该县解放以来，新区煤窑已有新的发展。五区旺村、白岸、郭壁、义堂等四村在工商管理局贷麦扶植下，煤窑由十三座增加到二十三座，每天大小窑口共出煤炭三千三百篓（每篓二百斤），销售挺快。工人由三百名增加到一千三百名。同时工人工资也逐渐提高。为了有计划的增加农民牲畜，便利牲畜交易，逐渐取缔了旧牙行吃“过水面”（即从中取利之意）的恶习，十一月廿五日，介休召集了城关骡马集市牙行开会，主要从打通思想扫除大家封建习惯着手，提出禁止“捏暗码”（黑市）等交易办法，买卖一律要公开说价。同时还废除了以往“牙行”旧名目，改称“牲畜交易员”。在扶助棉织业上，除在城关区成立了棉织业工会外，并进行了二十五万余元的贷款。现已有织袜机十七架，铁机十四架，木机十二架。转动织袜机每天能出成品八十五打，铁木机能出布五十四匹。为了供给原料，该棉业工会已派专人与榆次纱厂接洽，具体解决棉纱供给困难问题。
