While the reactionaries of the United States, Britain, and other countries are clamoring that the Berlin issue "cannot be resolved," the farce of the sham municipal election in West Berlin, directed by the United States, was staged on schedule on the 5th under the supervision and protection of a large number of military police. This action by the American reactionaries shows that they not only are unwilling to resolve the Berlin issue but also want to drag the issue on and are determined to further complicate the resolution of the Berlin issue by further dividing Berlin and dismembering Germany. The so-called mediation activities on the Berlin issue, led by the President of the Security Council, Argentine Foreign Minister Bramuglia, are in line with the wishes of the United States. Two days before the end of his term as President of the Security Council on November 30th, Bramuglia submitted a new proposal to the four countries of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France to resolve the Berlin issue, advocating that six "neutral countries" of the Security Council (namely Argentina, Belgium, Canada, "China" (Chiang Kai-shek's government), Colombia, and Syria) appoint financial experts to form a committee of experts with representatives from the United Nations Secretariat to study the Berlin currency issue for one month, and then submit a report to the Security Council. This new proposal is obviously intended to delay the resolution of the Berlin issue. The United States, Britain, and France agreed to this delaying tactic in a joint statement on the 1st. The Soviet Union, in a statement on November 29th, did not express rejection, but clearly stated that such "mediation" would "hardly make any progress." During his two-month "mediation" activities, Bramuglia consistently stood on the side of the United States. Initially, on October 15th, he cleverly used the trick of inviting the four countries to answer questions, trying to lure the Soviet Union into the discussion of the Berlin issue. Subsequently, on October 22nd, he put forward his "American-made plan," openly violating the four-power Moscow Agreement of August 30th, unilaterally demanding that the Soviet Union immediately lift traffic and business restrictions between Berlin and the Western occupation zones, and now he has put forward this delaying plan. Although, under the pressure of the world's vast people demanding direct negotiations on the Berlin issue among the four countries, Bramuglia once reached an agreement with the Soviet Union and had to agree to basically act in accordance with the four-power Moscow Agreement, he immediately abandoned it automatically once the United States opposed it.

The main purpose of the American imperialists in doing so, and the so-called six neutral countries of the Security Council in coordinating their actions in this way, is to allow the United States to continue to use the Berlin issue to create a war atmosphere, in order to facilitate its aggressive policy of preparing for war. New York Star reporter Stone pointed out: The American reactionary group "needs a few more months of panic so that they can pass expanded military appropriations in the U.S. Congress." A French Foreign Ministry official also revealed on November 29th: The American reactionaries "believe that once the threat of war disappears, the Atlantic Alliance will not be easy to consolidate and establish."

However, the American aggression plan continues to be strongly resisted from all sides. In order to resist the sham municipal election in West Berlin and maintain the unity of Berlin, representatives of the Berlin City Council, various political parties, public organizations, and enterprises held an emergency meeting on November 30th, deciding to form a Provisional Greater Berlin Municipal Government before a free general election is held in the entire Berlin. At the meeting, Albert, a member of the Socialist Unity Party, was elected mayor to manage the municipal affairs of the entire Berlin. Five hundred thousand men and women laborers in Berlin held a large demonstration and rally after the meeting, approving the decision to establish the Provisional Greater Berlin Municipal Government. The Soviet Military Administration officially recognized this provisional municipal government as the "only legitimate municipal organ" of Berlin on the 3rd and promised to provide all assistance. On the day of the sham municipal election in West Berlin, the broad masses of West Berlin citizens carried out a heroic resistance movement, and more than 100 people were arrested for posting and distributing leaflets and slogans against the election everywhere. At the same time, the Acting Commander of the Soviet Army in Berlin and the Mayor of the Provisional Greater Berlin Government issued statements simultaneously on the 7th, declaring this sham election completely invalid.

After the Far East International Military Tribunal announced the judgment on the twenty-five major Japanese war criminals, the American reactionaries are doing everything possible to try to rescue these Japanese criminals from the net of law that is about to be executed. Under the instruction and open support of MacArthur, Doihara and Hirota, who were sentenced to death by hanging, along with five other war criminals who were sentenced to imprisonment, appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court at the end of November, demanding the cancellation of the original sentence. The U.S. Supreme Court presumptuously disregarded the legitimate status of the International Military Tribunal, accepted the appeal of the Japanese war criminals, intending to delay or change the original sentence. In addition, MacArthur also openly advocated secretly executing the seven war criminals including Tojo who were sentenced to death by hanging; and decided not to issue an announcement in advance, strictly keep the time and place of the execution secret, strictly prohibit representatives of other Allied countries and any reporters from participating, and prohibit taking photos of the bodies of the war criminals after the fact, implementing secret burial.

The Chinese people firmly oppose this despicable act of the American reactionaries to shield Japanese war criminals. Although the verdict of the Far East International Military Tribunal this time is not completely satisfactory, the death sentences by hanging of seven war criminals including Tojo is, after all, a victory for world justice and public opinion. Now the American reactionaries are determined to overturn and destroy even such a verdict that is not completely satisfactory, which is an insult to the millions of victims who died in the War of Resistance Against Japan and a violation of the dignity of all nations that suffered from Japanese fascism. Therefore, the Chinese people cannot but express great indignation and protest!

The International Democratic Women's Federation, established on October 26, 1945, held its Second International Women's Congress in Budapest, Hungary, on the 1st. The congress lasted six days and was declared closed on the 6th. On the opening day of the congress, 100,000 women in Budapest held a torchlight parade under the slogan of opposing war-mongers and striving for democratic peace to show their congratulations. The congress reviewed the activities of the International Women's Federation in the past three years, formulated the tasks of international women in fighting for democratic peace and protecting the political and economic rights of women; and elected a new leadership structure for the International Democratic Women's Federation, with Mrs. Eug√©nie Cotton of France re-elected as chairperson, and Cai Chang, a representative of the Chinese liberated areas, and representatives from the United States and other countries, elected as vice-chairpersons. The reports, discussions, resolutions, and declarations of the congress marked that international women are carrying out a fighting unity against a new war, filled with their strong will and belief in winning democratic peace. Italian representative Mrs. Rossi pointed out in a report on the tasks of the Women's Federation on the 2nd: "The International Democratic Women's Federation will become the mainstay of democratic forces not only with political declarations but mainly with political actions." Soviet representative Lapshova vowed in a speech: "We will never allow the world to fall into a new war." In a declaration issued on the 6th, the congress denounced the imperialist wars waged by the American, British, French, and Dutch imperialists against the people of China, Greece, Indonesia, and Malaya, and called on women around the world to "join with other world democratic groups to form a united and solid front against the instigators of a new war!" In the declaration, the congress also declared on behalf of 80 million women from 56 countries with full confidence: "Our strength is infinite, and we will win the victory of democratic peace with our joint efforts!"

In the past week, there have been the following major international events:

(1) The American Democratic Far East Policy Committee held a "Mass Rally Against Interference in China" in New York on the 5th, with participants demanding that the U.S. government stop all aid to the Chiang Kai-shek government, withdraw all U.S. military personnel stationed in China, and let the Chinese people establish their own government.

(2) The strike movement of Japanese workers demanding increased wages continues to expand, with 40,000 seamen holding a second national strike in a week. A total of 75,000 metal miners and more than 14,000 shipbuilding workers have also been involved in the labor unrest. In order to suppress the labor movement, the anti-labor law drafted by the Japanese reactionary government under MacArthur's instructions was passed by the Japanese Diet on the 1st.

(3) The strike of dockworkers and sailors on the U.S. West Coast, which lasted for 95 days, ended victoriously on the 5th.

(4) The United Nations General Assembly, which opened on September 21st, decided to adjourn on the 11th or 12th.
