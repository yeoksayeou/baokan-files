While the reactionaries of the United States, Britain, and other countries are clamoring that the Berlin issue "cannot be resolved," the farce of the sham municipal election in West Berlin, directed by the United States, was staged on schedule on the 5th under the supervision and protection of a large number of military police. This action by the American reactionaries shows that they not only are unwilling to resolve the Berlin issue but also want to drag the issue on and are determined to further complicate the resolution of the Berlin issue by further dividing Berlin and dismembering Germany. The so-called mediation activities on the Berlin issue, led by the President of the Security Council, Argentine Foreign Minister Bramuglia, are in line with the wishes of the United States. Two days before the end of his term as President of the Security Council on November 30th, Bramuglia submitted a new proposal to the four countries of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France to resolve the Berlin issue, advocating that six "neutral countries" of the Security Council (namely Argentina, Belgium, Canada, "China" (Chiang Kai-shek's government), Colombia, and Syria) appoint financial experts to form a committee of experts with representatives from the United Nations Secretariat to study the Berlin currency issue for one month, and then submit a report to the Security Council. This new proposal is obviously intended to delay the resolution of the Berlin issue. The United States, Britain, and France agreed to this delaying tactic in a joint statement on the 1st. The Soviet Union, in a statement on November 29th, did not express rejection, but clearly stated that such "mediation" would "hardly make any progress." During his two-month "mediation" activities, Bramuglia consistently stood on the side of the United States. Initially, on October 15th, he cleverly used the trick of inviting the four countries to answer questions, trying to lure the Soviet Union into the discussion of the Berlin issue. Subsequently, on October 22nd, he put forward his "American-made plan," openly violating the four-power Moscow Agreement of August 30th, unilaterally demanding that the Soviet Union immediately lift traffic and business restrictions between Berlin and the Western occupation zones, and now he has put forward this delaying plan. Although, under the pressure of the world's vast people demanding direct negotiations on the Berlin issue among the four countries, Bramuglia once reached an agreement with the Soviet Union and had to agree to basically act in accordance with the four-power Moscow Agreement, he immediately abandoned it automatically once the United States opposed it.

The main purpose of the American imperialists in doing so, and the so-called six neutral countries of the Security Council in coordinating their actions in this way, is to allow the United States to continue to use the Berlin issue to create a war atmosphere, in order to facilitate its aggressive policy of preparing for war. New York Star reporter Stone pointed out: The American reactionary group "needs a few more months of panic so that they can pass expanded military appropriations in the U.S. Congress." A French Foreign Ministry official also revealed on November 29th: The American reactionaries "believe that once the threat of war disappears, the Atlantic Alliance will not be easy to consolidate and establish."

However, the American aggression plan continues to be strongly resisted from all sides. In order to resist the sham municipal election in West Berlin and maintain the unity of Berlin, representatives of the Berlin City Council, various political parties, public organizations, and enterprises held an emergency meeting on November 30th, deciding to form a Provisional Greater Berlin Municipal Government before a free general election is held in the entire Berlin. At the meeting, Albert, a member of the Socialist Unity Party, was elected mayor to manage the municipal affairs of the entire Berlin. Five hundred thousand men and women laborers in Berlin held a large demonstration and rally after the meeting, approving the decision to establish the Provisional Greater Berlin Municipal Government. The Soviet Military Administration officially recognized this provisional municipal government as the "only legitimate municipal organ" of Berlin on the 3rd and promised to provide all assistance. On the day of the sham municipal election in West Berlin, the broad masses of West Berlin citizens carried out a heroic resistance movement, and more than 100 people were arrested for posting and distributing leaflets and slogans against the election everywhere. At the same time, the Acting Commander of the Soviet Army in Berlin and the Mayor of the Provisional Greater Berlin Government issued statements simultaneously on the 7th, declaring this sham election completely invalid.

After the Far East International Military Tribunal announced the judgment on the twenty-five major Japanese war criminals, the American reactionaries are doing everything possible to try to rescue these Japanese criminals from the net of law that is about to be executed. Under the instruction and open support of MacArthur, Doihara and Hirota, who were sentenced to death by hanging, along with five other war criminals who were sentenced to imprisonment, appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court at the end of November, demanding the cancellation of the original sentence. The U.S. Supreme Court presumptuously disregarded the legitimate status of the International Military Tribunal, accepted the appeal of the Japanese war criminals, intending to delay or change the original sentence. In addition, MacArthur also openly advocated secretly executing the seven war criminals including Tojo who were sentenced to death by hanging; and decided not to issue an announcement in advance, strictly keep the time and place of the execution secret, strictly prohibit representatives of other Allied countries and any reporters from participating, and prohibit taking photos of the bodies of the war criminals after the fact, implementing secret burial.

The Chinese people firmly oppose this despicable act of the American reactionaries to shield Japanese war criminals. Although the verdict of the Far East International Military Tribunal this time is not completely satisfactory, the death sentences by hanging of seven war criminals including Tojo is, after all, a victory for world justice and public opinion. Now the American reactionaries are determined to overturn and destroy even such a verdict that is not completely satisfactory, which is an insult to the millions of victims who died in the War of Resistance Against Japan and a violation of the dignity of all nations that suffered from Japanese fascism. Therefore, the Chinese people cannot but express great indignation and protest!

The International Democratic Women's Federation, established on October 26, 1945, held its Second International Women's Congress in Budapest, Hungary, on the 1st. The congress lasted six days and was declared closed on the 6th. On the opening day of the congress, 100,000 women in Budapest held a torchlight parade under the slogan of opposing war-mongers and striving for democratic peace to show their congratulations. The congress reviewed the activities of the International Women's Federation in the past three years, formulated the tasks of international women in fighting for democratic peace and protecting the political and economic rights of women; and elected a new leadership structure for the International Democratic Women's Federation, with Mrs. Eugénie Cotton of France re-elected as chairperson, and Cai Chang, a representative of the Chinese liberated areas, and representatives from the United States and other countries, elected as vice-chairpersons. The reports, discussions, resolutions, and declarations of the congress marked that international women are carrying out a fighting unity against a new war, filled with their strong will and belief in winning democratic peace. Italian representative Mrs. Rossi pointed out in a report on the tasks of the Women's Federation on the 2nd: "The International Democratic Women's Federation will become the mainstay of democratic forces not only with political declarations but mainly with political actions." Soviet representative Lapshova vowed in a speech: "We will never allow the world to fall into a new war." In a declaration issued on the 6th, the congress denounced the imperialist wars waged by the American, British, French, and Dutch imperialists against the people of China, Greece, Indonesia, and Malaya, and called on women around the world to "join with other world democratic groups to form a united and solid front against the instigators of a new war!" In the declaration, the congress also declared on behalf of 80 million women from 56 countries with full confidence: "Our strength is infinite, and we will win the victory of democratic peace with our joint efforts!"

In the past week, there have been the following major international events:

(1) The American Democratic Far East Policy Committee held a "Mass Rally Against Interference in China" in New York on the 5th, with participants demanding that the U.S. government stop all aid to the Chiang Kai-shek government, withdraw all U.S. military personnel stationed in China, and let the Chinese people establish their own government.

(2) The strike movement of Japanese workers demanding increased wages continues to expand, with 40,000 seamen holding a second national strike in a week. A total of 75,000 metal miners and more than 14,000 shipbuilding workers have also been involved in the labor unrest. In order to suppress the labor movement, the anti-labor law drafted by the Japanese reactionary government under MacArthur's instructions was passed by the Japanese Diet on the 1st.

(3) The strike of dockworkers and sailors on the U.S. West Coast, which lasted for 95 days, ended victoriously on the 5th.

(4) The United Nations General Assembly, which opened on September 21st, decided to adjourn on the 11th or 12th.

    国际一周
    与美英等国反动派叫嚣柏林问题“不可能达到解决”的同时，美国导演下的西柏林伪市选的丑剧，在大批军警的监督、保护下，已按期于五日演出。美国反动派的这种作法，表明它现在不仅还不愿解决柏林问题，还想把这个问题拖下去，而且还决心用进一步分裂柏林、肢解德国的方法，使柏林问题的解决更增加困难。以安理会主席、阿根廷外长布拉玛葛利亚为首的关于柏林问题的所谓调解活动，是和美国的愿望相符合的。布氏在他安理会主席任期于十一月三十日终了的前两天，又向苏美英法四国提出所谓解决柏林问题的新方案，主张由安理会六“中立国”（即阿根廷、比利时、加拿大、“中国”（蒋政府）、哥伦比亚、叙利亚）指派财政专家，和联合国秘书处代表合组一个专家委员会，对柏林货币问题作一个月的研究，然后向安理会提出报告。这个新方案，很明显是想拖延柏林问题的解决。美英法三国在一日的联合声明中，已同意这个拖延办法。苏联在十一月二十九日的声明中，没有表示拒绝，但明确说明这种“调解”“很难获得任何进展”。布氏在他的两个多月的“调解”活动中，一贯站在偏袒美国的立场上。初则于十月十五日巧施诡计，想以邀请四国答复问题的方式，诱使苏联卷入柏林问题之讨论。继则于同月二十二日提出其“美国制方案”，公开违反八月三十日的四国莫斯科协议，片面要求苏联立即取消柏林与西方占领区的交通和商务限制，现在又提出了这个拖延方案。虽然，在世界广大人民要求四国直接谈判柏林问题的压力下，布氏亦曾一度和苏联取得协议，不得不同意基本上按照四国莫斯科协议办事，但一经美国的反对，他就马上自动地抛弃了。
    美国帝国主义者所以这样做，安理会所谓六中立国所以这样配合行动，其主要目的之一，就在于好让美国继续利用柏林问题制造战争气氛，以便利其进行准备战争的侵略政策。纽约明星报记者史东指出：美国反动集团“还需要几个月的惊慌状态的时间，以便他们在美国国会通过扩大军事拨款。”法国外交部官员十一月二十九日也透露：美国反动派“认为战争威胁一旦消失，大西洋联盟即不易巩固建立”。
    但是，美国的侵略计划，正继续受到各方面的强烈反击。为了抗击西柏林伪市选和维护柏林市的统一，柏林市议会、各政党、各公共团体及各企业的代表们，于十一月三十日召开了非常会议，决议在全柏林举行自由普选以前，先组成大柏林临时市政府，会上并当场选出统一社会党人艾伯特为市长，以管理全柏林的市政。柏林五十万男女劳动人民在会后举行了大示威和集会，批准了成立大柏林临时市政府的决议。苏联军政府三日亦正式承认这一临时市政府为柏林“唯一合法的市政机关”，并允诺给予一切帮助。在西柏林伪市选的那天，西柏林广大市民进行了英勇的抵制运动，因到处张贴和散发抵制选举的传单与标语而被捕者，即有百人以上。同时，柏林苏军代理司令和大柏林临时政府市长，已于七日同时发表声明，宣布这一伪选完全无效。
    在远东国际军事法庭宣布关于二十五名日本主要战犯的判决书后，美国反动派正千方百计，妄图将这些日本罪犯从即将执刑的法网中救出来。在麦克阿瑟的授意和公开支持下，被判处绞刑的土肥原、广田，连同其他被判徒刑的五名战犯，于十一月底向美国最高法院上诉，要求取消原判。美国最高法院竟狂妄地蔑视国际军事法庭的合法地位，受理日本战犯的上诉，意图拖延或改变原判。此外，麦克阿瑟还公然主张对被判绞刑的东条等七名战犯秘密执刑；并决定事先不发公告，执刑的时间和地点严守秘密，严禁其他盟国代表及任何记者参加，事后不准拍摄战犯尸体之照片，实行秘密埋葬。
    中国人民坚决反对美国反动派这种庇护日本战犯的卑劣行为。远东国际军事法庭的这次判决，虽然不能完全满意，但是东条等七名战犯的判处绞刑，究竟是世界正义舆论的一部分胜利。现在美国反动派连这样一个不能令人完全满意的判决，亦决心要推翻和破坏，这是对千百万在抗日战争中死难者的污辱，是对于遭受日本法西斯侵害的各民族之尊严的侵犯。因此，中国人民对此不能不表示极大的义愤和抗议！
    一九四五年十月二十六日成立的国际民主妇女联盟，在一日于匈京布达佩斯召开了国际妇女第二次代表大会。大会历时六天，已于六日宣告闭幕。在大会开幕那天，匈京十万妇女在为反对战争贩子、争取民主和平的口号下，举行了火炬游行，以示祝贺。这次大会检讨了国际妇联三年来的活动，制定了国际妇女为民主和平，为保护妇女政治经济权利而斗争的任务；并选出了国际民主妇联新的领导机构，法国的戈登夫人连任主席，中国解放区代表蔡畅及美国等代表，当选为副主席。大会的报告、讨论、决议和宣言，标志着国际妇女正在为反对新战争而实行战斗大团结，充溢着她们为赢得民主和平的坚强意志和信念。意大利代表罗西夫人在二日报告妇联的任务时指出：“国际民主妇联不仅将以政治宣言，而且主要地是以政治行动成为民主力量的中流砥柱”。苏联代表拉普什娃在演说中宣誓：“我们决不容许使世界陷入新的战争中。”大会在六日发表的宣言中，痛斥美英法荷帝国主义对中国、希腊、印尼和马来亚人民所进行的帝国主义战争，号召全世界妇女“和其他世界民主团体共同组成团结而巩固的阵线，反对新战争挑拨者！”大会在宣言中并代表五十六国的八千万妇女充满信心地宣告：“我们的力量是无穷的，我们将以共同的努力，赢得民主和平的胜利！”
    过去一周国际间尚有如下几件大事：
    （一）美国民主远东政策委员会，于五日在纽约召开“不干涉中国的群众大会”，与会者要求美国政府停止对蒋介石政府的一切援助，撤退一切美国驻华军事人员，让中国人民建立自己的政府。
    （二）日本工人要求增加工资的罢工运动，继续扩大，四万海员工人在一周内举行第二次全国性罢工。全日七万五千名金属矿工、一万四千余造船工人等，均已卷入工潮。为了镇压工运，日本反动政府根据麦克阿瑟指示所草拟的反劳工法，已于一日经日本议会通过。
    （三）坚持达九十五天的美国西海岸码头工人与海员罢工，已于五日胜利结束。
    （四）自九月二十一日开幕的联合国大会，决定于十一或十二日休会。
