Xinhua News Agency, Huaihai Front, 20th -- In the prisoner of war group from Sun Yuanliang's annihilated Kuomintang bandit army, a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army recently uncovered four more high-ranking enemy officers: Wang Xiazhang, commander of the 47th Army; Li Jiaying, major general and deputy commander of the same army; Ni Xuchen, colonel and chief of staff of the 127th Division of the same army; and Zhou Gongfu, colonel and commander of the 379th Regiment of the 127th Division. Previously, Chen Yuanxiang, major general and deputy commander of the 41st Army, and Zhang Guanghan, major general and commander of the 127th Division of the 47th Army, had been uncovered. When Wang Xiazhang confessed to his capture, he said: "This time, when we retreated from Xuzhou, the troops were extremely chaotic. When our army group reached the Xiaoxian area, it became a tangled mass with the Qiu Qingquan and Li Mi army groups. The roads were blocked, and cars and mules and horses were mixed in, in a disorderly manner. Everyone scrambled and trampled on each other. The troops could not be commanded at all. When we realized we were surrounded by the People's Liberation Army, the troops became even more chaotic and fought each other, resulting in many casualties. On the evening of the 6th, Sun Yuanliang found me in Li Shilin Village and simply told me, 'Break out in small groups towards Shangqiu.' I then took the first battalion of the 374th Regiment and ran out in a confused manner. As soon as I went out, I lost my way and was surrounded by the People's Liberation Army just east of Liuji. The troops were scattered and defeated. That's how I became a prisoner."

　　淮海前线敌高级军官
    续被我查获四名
    【新华社淮海前线二十日电】解放军某部于被歼的国民党匪军孙元良兵团的俘虏群中，顷又查获敌高级军官四十七军军长汪匣锋，少将副军长李家英，该军一二七师上校参谋长倪续臣，一二七师三七九团上校团长周公辅等。在此以前被查获者有四十一军少将副军长陈元湘，四十七军一二七师少将师长张光汉。汪匣锋供述其被俘经过时称：“这次我们从徐州败退时，部队非常紊乱。我们的兵团到达萧县地区，便和邱清泉、李弥两兵团挤成一团。道路阻塞，汽车骡马杂乱其间，乱无秩序，大家争先恐后，践踏冲撞。部队根本无法指挥。当我们发现被解放军包围时，部队更加混乱，互相打起来，伤亡很多。六日黄昏，孙元良在李石林庄把我找去，只简单告诉了一句‘向商邱分散突围’。我便带着三七四团一营糊里糊涂向外跑，一出门就迷失了方向，刚跑到刘集以东，就被解放军包围了。部队被打得七零八落。我就这样的当了俘虏。”
