Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 1st. Over the past three years, Chiang Kai-shek has lost approximately one million troops on the Northeast battlefield. Among them, about 400,000 officers and soldiers were lost during the powerful autumn offensive from mid-September to early November this year, when we liberated the entire Northeast. The troops of Chiang Kai-shek who fought in the Northeast battlefield for three years, except for a small number of remnants who fled in disarray from Jinxi and Huludao, the rest of the troops were completely wiped out. None of the Kuomintang troops in the Northeast have escaped the annihilating blows of the Northeast People's Liberation Army in the past three years. Among them, 71st Army's 88th Division was completely annihilated four times, 49th Army's 79th Division was completely annihilated three times, 52nd Army's 25th Division, 49th Army's 105th Division, 53rd Army's 116th Division, 60th Army's 184th Division, 71st Army's 91st Division, and New 5th Army's 195th Division (originally under the 52nd Army) were completely annihilated twice. The 63rd Army's 184th Division revolted once, and the 60th Army's Provisional 21st Division was completely annihilated once and revolted once. The number of regiments, battalions, or stragglers annihilated from each division is not included. Even the New 1st Army, known as the "Number One Army Under Heaven," had its New 30th Division, New 38th Division, and New 50th Division suffer the annihilation of five regiments and three battalions before their final complete annihilation, in addition to scattered annihilations, totaling more than two divisions. The Northeast is one of the most important battlefields for the Kuomintang in the country. On this battlefield, it possessed a huge force. As early as the summer of 1946, its order of battle listed eight armies, twenty-one divisions, three security corps, and seven security detachments, as well as several cavalry regiments. It had the top elite troops of the Kuomintang army, such as the New 1st Army and New 6th Army, as well as other American-equipped direct-line troops such as the 71st Army, 13th Army, and 52nd Army. However, after the strong blows of the Northeast People's Liberation Army, although they occupied the Beining Railway line outside the pass, the Changchun section south of the China Changchun Railway, the Jincheng Railway, the Shenyang-Jilin Railway Hailong-Jilin section, and the Siping-Meihekou Railway and cities along the line at the beginning of the war, their main force was depleted, and their forces were dispersed, which facilitated the subsequent annihilation of them by the Northeast Liberation Army. In the spring of 1947, our North Manchurian army went south of the Songhua River three times, and our South Manchurian army defended Linjiang four times. The enemy's entire divisions were annihilated, totaling four divisions, and one division revolted. A total of twenty-four regiments were annihilated, and other battalions, companies, and stragglers annihilated were not included. Due to the enemy's reinforcements from within the pass and the reorganization of pseudo-bandits, the capture of conscripts, and other measures to readjust the decadent structure and replenish vacancies after the replenishment of equipment, although they were again subjected to our summer offensive in 1947, the numbers appearing on the Chiang army's order of battle in the autumn still increased rather than decreased. At that time, under the Northeast Headquarters of Chiang's bandits, there were four army corps, each army corps under the jurisdiction of eight armies, another reorganized 207th division equivalent to an army, a total of thirty divisions, three reorganized brigades, and two reorganized divisions, as well as troops directly under the bandit headquarters, such as the 13th Army. However, after our autumn offensive, the enemy's entire divisions were annihilated, totaling seven. The number of regiments and battalions annihilated were not included. Up to this point, a total of thirty regular divisions, fourteen provisional divisions, one cavalry division, four cavalry brigades, and some local security forces had been repeatedly annihilated. Even its "ace" New 1st Army and New 6th Army were shattered and their combat effectiveness greatly weakened. At this time, most of Chiang's old troops had suffered devastating blows, and their strength was extremely insufficient. Therefore, they reluctantly pieced together local teams to supplement the main force establishment. After our winter offensive in January, February, and March this year annihilated eight entire divisions, one army headquarters, and other troops totaling more than 150,000 people, there were still a total of four army corps, all regular army numbers included fourteen armies, thirty-nine divisions, and many units directly under the Northeast "Suppression Headquarters" and the "Jinzhou Command Post." However, after the start of our autumn offensive, they were quickly wiped out one by one in the face of the ever-victorious and invincible Liberation Army, either with entire army corps being annihilated (Fan Hanjie, Liao Yaoxiang, Zhou Fucheng, etc. army corps), or with entire army corps revolting and surrendering (Zheng Dongguo army corps). The 62nd Army and other five divisions transferred from North China in September and October to reinforce, and the two divisions of the 39th Army reinforced from Yantai, only watched helplessly in Jinxi as all the Chiang bandits in the Northeast were wiped out. Then they fled by sea with the 54th Army and other four divisions that had narrowly escaped annihilation.

　　蒋匪在东北作战三年
  　被我军消灭一百万
    【新华社哈尔滨一日电】蒋介石三年来在东北战场整整送掉了约计百余万大军。其中约四十万官兵是在今年此次九月中旬至十一月初，我解放全东北的强大秋季攻势中丧失的。蒋介石三年来在东北战场作战的部队，除少数残部已从锦西、葫芦岛狼狈逃跑外，其余部队全部干干净净地覆灭了。东北全部国民党军，三年来没有一支部队是未曾遭受到东北人民解放军歼灭性打击的，而整师先后反复被歼二次以上的计有七十一军八十八师被全歼四次，四十九军七十九师被全歼三次，五十二军二十五师，四十九军一零五师，五十三军一一六师，六十军一八四师，七十一军九十一师，新五军一九五师（该师原属五十二军）被全歼二次，六十三军一八四师起义一次，六十军暂二十一师被全歼一次，起义一次，各师先后整团整营或零星被歼者未计在内。即号称天下第一军之新一军的新三十师，新三十八，新五十师三个师在最后被全歼前除零星被歼外先后整团、整营被歼者即达五个团三个营，合两个师之多。东北是国民党在全国的最主要的战场之一，在这个战场上，它拥有庞大的兵力，远在一九四六年夏季，在其战斗序列表上，即载有八个军廿一个师，三个保安总队和七个保安支队及若干骑兵团等，这里有着国民党军头等精锐的新一军、新六军，还有其他美械嫡系部队七十一军，十三军，五十二军等。但经过东北人民解放军的强有力的打击，虽然在战争之初他们侵占了关外北宁路沿线，中长路长春以南锦承路，沈（阳）吉（林）路海（龙）吉（林）段，四（平）梅（河口）路等铁路及沿线城市，但是他们的主力消耗了，兵力分散了，这就便利于以后东北解放军将他们各个歼灭。一九四七年春，我北满大军三下松花江南，南满我军四保临江后，敌整师被歼者即有四个师，起义者一个师，整团被歼者共二十四个团，其他整营整连及零星被歼者未计。由于敌人由关内增援及收编伪匪捕抓壮丁等重新调整腐朽机构，填充缺额，整补装备后，所以虽然再经过一九四七年我夏季攻势的打击，但出现在秋季蒋军战斗序列表上的番号仍然有增无减，当时在蒋匪东北行辕之下则有四个兵团，兵团之下辖八个军，另一个相当于军的整编二零七师，共三十个师，三个整编旅及两个整编师，另匪行辕直辖部队，十三军等未计。但是再经过我秋季攻势的结果，敌整师被歼者有七个团，其整团整营被歼者未计。至此其一再被歼的部队即共有三十个正规师、十四个暂编师、一个骑兵师、四个骑兵旅及一些地方保安部队…………就连其“王牌”新一军、新六军也被打得支离破碎战斗力大大削弱。此时蒋匪老部队大部遭受歼灭性打击，兵力极端不足，于是遂勉强拼凑地方团队补充为主力建制，在今年一、二、三月我冬季攻势歼其八个整师，一个军部及其他部队共十五万余人后，在他们的战斗序列表上还共有四个兵团，全部正规军番号有十四个军、三十九个师及东北“剿总”及“锦州指挥所”的许多直属部队。但是，在我军此次秋季攻势开始后，他们在愈战愈强无坚不摧的解放军面前，却一一迅速覆灭，或整兵团被歼（范汉杰、廖耀湘、周福成等兵团），或整个兵团起义和投降（郑洞国兵团）。而九、十月从华北调来增援的六十二军等五个师，从烟台增援的三十九军两个师，也只在锦西眼巴巴的看着东北蒋匪全部覆没后，带着几个侥幸逃脱被歼的五十四军等四个师由海上逃跑了。
