Xinhua News Agency, North China, 4th:國民党 soldiers who were driven to the Northeast to risk their lives for the Four Big Families, and then driven back to Guannei after being wounded, are now stranded in Tianjin, suffering abuse and persecution from the Kuomintang government. According to reports in the Kuomintang Tianjin New Star Newspaper on the 12th and 13th of last month, thousands of wounded Kuomintang soldiers arrived in Tianjin from Jinzhou, western Liaoning. Most were refused accommodation, had no food or lodging, and were unable to receive treatment, leaving them to roam the streets and become beggars. Driven by hunger and cold, they roamed everywhere in groups, grabbing food. They would swarm any food stall they found. The New Star Newspaper described the plight of the wounded soldiers as follows: "This hungry group, some still wearing only single trousers, dragging their weary bodies, feebly walking," cursing the Kuomintang government as they walked. Having reached a dead end, they placed their last hope in returning to their distant southern hometowns, but the Kuomintang authorities not only failed to help them, but also interfered and persecuted them. After hundreds of wounded soldiers crowded onto the "Hai Niu" ship bound for Shanghai, the Kuomintang authorities dispatched a large number of military police and police on the 12th of last month to forcibly drag them off the ship, "even those hidden in the bottom of the hold, the engine room, and next to the coal piles, were forcibly pulled out," and some wounded soldiers were beaten.

　　天津街头饥饿的一群
  　在南方被抓丁到东北卖命受伤后被遗弃流落为乞丐
    【新华社华北四日电】被驱往东北为四大家族卖命，受伤后又被驱回关内的国民党士兵，流落天津，备受国民党政府虐待与迫害。据国民党天津新星报上月十二、十三日报导：由辽西锦州抵达天津的国民党军伤兵达数千人，大部被拒绝收容，无食无宿，更无法获得治疗，流落街头，沦为乞丐。在饥寒交迫下，他们成群结队的到处抢食，见到吃食摊子就一拥而上。新星报形容伤兵的情景时说：“这饥饿的一群，有的犹穿着单裤，拖着疲惫的身子，有气无力的＠＠前行”，边走边骂着国民党政府。他们走头无路，把最后的希望寄托在返回遥远的南方故乡，但国民党当局对此非但不加帮助，反而加以干涉迫害。数百名伤兵拥上开往上海的“海牛”轮上后，国民党当局随于上月十二日派出大批宪兵、警察，把他们从船上硬拖下来，“连藏在舱底、机器房和煤堆旁的伤兵，全强行拉下”，有的伤兵还被殴打。
