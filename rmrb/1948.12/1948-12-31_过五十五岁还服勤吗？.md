　　Still Serving After Age 55?
    Question: Regarding labor, ages 16 to 17 are considered semi-labor, and ages 51 to 55 are also considered semi-labor. Ages 18 to 50 are considered full labor. I would like to ask, after the age of 55, are there still obligations such as delivering letters and serving?
  　　　　　　　Lingchuan Wujiawan, Li Shouwen
    Answer: The age regulations for service are determined based on the ability to serve. Generally speaking, after the service age is reached, the ability to serve is lost. Although some individuals may still be able to serve after the service age, this is just an isolated phenomenon. In order to facilitate enforcement, it is necessary to follow the age regulations for service. Therefore, people over the age of 55 should no longer have the obligation to deliver letters.

### 过五十五岁还服勤吗？

　　过五十五岁还服勤吗？
    问：关于劳力问题，十六岁至十七岁为半劳力，五十一岁至五十五岁也算半劳力，十八岁至五十岁算全劳力。请问过了五十五岁，是否还有送信服勤等义务？
  　　　　　　　陵川武家湾　李守文
    答：服勤的年龄规定，就是根据服勤的能力确定的，一般的说过了服勤年龄也就失去了服勤的能力，虽然个别的人过了服勤年龄还能服勤，这只是个别现象，为了便利执行，必须依据服勤的年龄规定，所以过了五十五岁的人，就不应再有送信的义务。
