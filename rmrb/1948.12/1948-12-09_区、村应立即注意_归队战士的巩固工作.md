Districts and Villages Should Immediately Pay Attention to the Consolidation of Returned Soldiers

Due to insufficient inspection, supervision, and education, deserting soldiers remain in various localities. According to Ping Shan County's understanding, there are more than 20 deserting soldiers in Chuanfang Village, District 1. These deserting soldiers usually do not participate in village work assignments, and some disrupt social order, hindering the progress of various tasks. Especially regarding conscription, if a village has many deserting soldiers, it is difficult to mobilize new recruits, and even after enlistment, they may follow the previous example and desert.

During this conscription in Ping Shan, the focus was first on mobilizing deserting soldiers to return to their units. In a few days, the districts concentrated about 300 soldiers. What deserves immediate attention is that if consolidation work is not emphasized after concentration, this mobilization will be in vain.

Generally, district and village cadres often use simple methods to mobilize soldiers to return to their units in order to complete their tasks. After finding or concentrating the people in the district and village, they quickly hand them over to their superiors, rarely considering the actual effect these soldiers will have after returning to their units. Village cadres usually feel disgusted with deserting soldiers and even abuse them, which is wrong. As a result, returned soldiers feel dissatisfied and resistant, and some plan to "not run away from the district or county, but run away after enlistment." These phenomena must be corrected.

To solve this problem, the Third District of Ping Shan County has created some methods and experiences in its work, which are worth learning from in various places: The county party committee first persuaded district and village cadres to overcome antagonistic emotions and hold a get-together with the returned soldiers. The returned soldiers were encouraged to raise as many opinions as possible to the cadres; the cadres then made self-criticisms and responded to and resolved the actual difficulties and family farm work raised. Then, both sides made mutual guarantees and took oaths. At the same time, a small number of lawbreakers who had deserted multiple times were subjected to disciplinary sanctions or public education. After doing this, the returned soldiers underwent preliminary changes in their thinking and emotions.

After the returned deserting soldiers are concentrated, the cadres, party members, masses, and their relatives in the village should be mobilized to persuade them and warmly welcome them. It is essential to establish a certain belief and foundation in their thinking.

### 区、村应立即注意　归队战士的巩固工作

　　区、村应立即注意
  　归队战士的巩固工作
    由于检查督促及教育工作不够，逃亡战士得存留各地，根据平山县的了解，一区的川坊村，即有逃亡战士二十余名，逃亡战士平常在村里多半不出差勤任务，有的则扰乱社会秩序，妨碍各种工作的进行，特别是对参军工作，那村逃亡战士多，新兵就难动员，而且入伍后又会照前例逃回。
    平山这次参军中，曾首先抓紧动员逃亡战士归队，各区在数日内即集中了约三百名。其中值得立即注意的是，如果集中之后不注意巩固工作，则这种动员也会落空的。
    一般区村干部动员战士归队，多采用简单办法来争取完成任务。在区村把人找到或集中后即迅速交给上级，很少考虑到这些战士归队以后的实际效果将会如何。村干部对逃亡战士，通常感到厌恶，甚至加以虐待，这是错误的。归队战士因此心中不满、情绪对抗，有的则准备“区上、县上不跑，入伍以后再跑。”这些现象必须加以纠正。
    为解决此问题，平山县三区工作中创造出一些办法及经验，值得各地学习：县委首先说服区村干部克服对立情绪，与归队战士举行联欢会，由归队战士向干部尽量提出意见；干部则进行检讨，并对所提实际困难及家庭代耕等予以答复及解决，然后双方互相保证，进行宣誓，同时对少数多次逃跑之违法分子，则予以纪律制裁或当众教育。经这样作，归队战士在思想及情绪上都有初步转变。
    归队逃亡战士集中之后，就应动员本村之干部、党员、群众及其亲属向其进行说服及热烈之欢送。使其在思想上建立一定之信念与基础，这是十分必要的。
