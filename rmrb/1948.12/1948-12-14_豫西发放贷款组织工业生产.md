Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains, 10th. The Yuxi Administrative Office in the Central Plains Liberated Area has issued loans of 20,000 million Central Plains currency for industry, commerce, and rural sideline occupations to help the people of Yuxi restore and develop production. In a proclamation issued on November 17, the Yuxi Administrative Office called on all men, women, and children in the region to mobilize together, participate in winter production, and increase income. Since the establishment of the democratic government, some industrial production in Yuxi has greatly developed: the weaving and wool-weaving industry in Luoyang has increased from 14 companies under the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries to 107 now, and the cotton-ginning industry has increased from 13 to 50; the paper-making industry in Xiatang, Lushan, has recovered to about 200 companies. At present, the Yuxi area and the Yu-Wan-Su area have been linked together, and transportation with the North China Liberated Area is unimpeded. The sales of these industrial products are increasing daily, and the prospects for industrial production development are even greater. The production enterprises that were ravaged by the Kuomintang in the past are in urgent need of restoration. The Administrative Office's proclamation pointed out that coal industry should be quickly planned for restoration and development this winter, handicraft weaving, soap-making, paper-making and other industries should be greatly developed, the transportation industry should be developed, women's weaving in household sideline occupations should be developed, and counties with silkworm slopes should prepare silkworm eggs in order to increase silk production next year. In areas with iron sand, iron smelting and other industries, production should be well organized. The proclamation called on governments at all levels to help the masses formulate and implement production plans based on the specific conditions of their counties and districts, and industrial and commercial bureaus and trade agencies at all levels should actively provide practical assistance to the masses in production in terms of supplying raw materials and promoting products. Within the area under the jurisdiction of the Yuxi Administrative Office, since the successive liberation of Zhengzhou and Nanyang, and the mass movement to suppress bandits has achieved great results, except for Lingbao and Xinxiang, where a small number of Hu Zongnan bandit troops are entrenched, the social order in most of the 45 counties in the region is becoming more stable, creating favorable conditions for restoring and developing production.

    豫西发放贷款组织工业生产
    【新华社中原十日电】中原解放区豫西行署发放工商业和农村副业贷款中州币两万万元，扶助豫西人民恢复与发展生产。在十一月十七日发表的文告中，豫西行署号召全区男女老幼一齐动员起来，参加冬季生产，增加收入。民主政府成立以来，豫西某些工业生产已有很大发展：洛阳的织布、织毛业由国民党反动派统治时的十四家增到现在的一百零七家，弹花业由十三家增到五十家；鲁山下汤的造纸业则已恢复到二百家左右。目前豫西区与豫皖苏区已联成一片，与华北解放区的交通亦已畅通无阻，这些工业生产品的销路日广，工业生产发展前途更大。过去被国民党摧残的生产事业，均亟待恢复，行署文告指出：今冬应迅速筹划恢复与发展煤业，大大发展手工纺织、肥皂、造纸等业，开展运输业，发展家庭副业的妇女纺织，有蚕坡各县则应准备好蚕种，以便明年增加蚕丝产量。在有铁砂、炼铁等业的地区，应好好组织生产。文告号召各级政府应根据本县本区具体条件，帮助群众制订和实现生产计划，各级工商局和贸易机关应在供给原料和推销产品上积极予群众生产以切实帮助。在豫西行署所辖地区内，自郑州、南阳相继解放，群众性的剿匪运动又获得很大成绩以来，除灵宝、新乡尚有少数胡宗南匪军盘踞外，全区四十五个县绝大部分地区社会秩序日趋安定，已造成恢复与发展生产的有利条件。
