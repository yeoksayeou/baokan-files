Xinhua News Agency, East China, 10th: The powerful East China People's Liberation Army reserve corps is now steadily streaming towards the Huaihai Front. This corps includes tens of thousands of peasants who have turned over a new leaf after the land reform, as well as thousands upon thousands of liberated soldiers from the Jinan and Yanzhou campaigns. After several months of current affairs education, class education, and military training, their political awareness and military skills have generally improved. In particular, inspired by the glorious victory of the Huaihai Campaign, many commanders and fighters have expressed that now is the best time to eliminate the main force of the Kuomintang army in large numbers, and they are determined not to let go of such a good opportunity. Therefore, they have successively requested to go to the front lines. When these requests were approved by the East China Military Region, the morale of the entire army was very high, and each unit immediately held rallies to vow to go on the expedition. When a certain unit selected strong men before the expedition, a 38-year-old liberated soldier was initially eliminated after everyone's discussion, but he firmly demanded to go on the expedition. He said: "How much road everyone walks, I can also walk that much road, you charge, and I can charge the same! In the past, I carried a gun for the enemy for six or seven years, but today I am fighting for myself, you must not leave me behind!" His words deeply moved everyone, and his request was accepted. Before the reserve corps set off, nearly ten thousand people came to see them off. Many soldiers from the South shouted: "Down with Chiang Kai-shek! Fight back to our hometown! Liberate our hometown!"

Xinhua News Agency, Huaihai Front, 10th: According to Kuomintang military officers captured on the Huaihai Front, the morale of the Kuomintang army is low, and they have generally lost their fighting spirit. Huang Yushan, deputy battalion commander of the logistics battalion of the 45th Division of the bandit army's Fifth Army, who surrendered to our army in the Dangshan area, said: "We all know that the People's Liberation Army has three things it won't fight: first, it won't fight if it suffers a loss; second, it won't fight if it's not sure of winning; and third, it won't fight if it can't annihilate the enemy. When we see the People's Liberation Army, we completely lose confidence in winning the battle." Xie Jingzhi, the battalion commander of the engineer battalion of the same division, summoned the company commander under his command to study surrender when he was surrounded and annihilated, and ordered to stop resisting. Many Kuomintang military officers of Chiang Kai-shek's Fifth Army who were liberated by us said: "Our lower-level military officers call each other 'desperadoes'" (meaning that if they are not killed, they will be captured anyway, and there will be no good end). The reception station for liberated military officers of a certain unit recently held a forum, attended by 250 field and company grade officers, all of whom regarded being liberated as an honor. Lu Guozhang, a lieutenant platoon leader of the Second Company of the 109th Regiment of the 37th Division of the bandit army's 77th Army, said: "I surrendered before the gun was fired." The officers of the Second Machine Gun Company said: "Our heavy machine guns and mortars were never even taken off their pack animals." Among the officers of the 77th Army, the following song is popular: "Following Chiang Kai-shek, you are bound to die; following Mao Zedong, you are bound to succeed."

    我强大华东后备兵团正源源涌向淮海前线
    【新华社华东十日电】强大的华东解放军后备兵团，现正源源涌向淮海前线。这一兵团中，有数万土地改革后翻身的农民，也有成千成万的济南、兖州战役的解放战士。他们经过几个月的时事教育、阶级教育和军事教育，政治觉悟与军事技术普遍提高。特别是由于淮海战役辉煌胜利的鼓舞，许多指战员都表示：现在正是大量消灭国民党军队主力的最好时机，他们决不愿放过这样的好机会。因此纷纷提出开赴前线的要求。当这些请求为华东军区批准后，全军士气十分高昂，各部立即分别举行了誓师出征大会。某部一个连队于出征前挑选精壮时，一个三十八岁的解放战士最初经大家讨论结果落选了，但他坚决要求出征。他说：“大家走多少路，我也能走多少路，你们冲锋我也一样能冲呀！过去给敌人扛了六七年枪，今天是为自己打仗了，你们无论如何不能撇掉我！”他的话使大家都受到深刻的感动，他的要求被接受了。后备兵团出发前，有近万的人民来欢送他们。许多南方的战士们，高呼着：“打倒蒋介石！打回老家去！解放我们的家乡！”
    【新华社淮海前线十日电】据在淮海前线被俘的国民党军官供认，国民党军士气低落，普遍丧失斗志。在砀山地区作战中投降我军的匪军第五军四十五师的辎重营副营长黄玉山说：“我们都晓得解放军有三不打：第一吃亏不打，第二没有把握不打，第三歼灭不了不打。我们见了解放军，就完全丧失了战斗胜利的信心。”该师工兵营营长谢静之在被围歼时，即召集他所属之连长研究投降，并下令停止抵抗。蒋匪第五军许多被我解放的军官说：“我们下级军官见了面都叫亡命徒”（意思是不打死就被俘，反正没有好下场）。某部解放军官招待所最近召开一次座谈会，到会二百五十个校尉级军官，都以被解放为光荣。匪军七十七军三十七师一零九团二连中尉排长路国章说：“我是在没响枪前就缴枪的。”机枪二连的军官说：“我们的重机枪、迫击炮就没有下驮子。”七十七军军官中，流行着：“跟着蒋中正，一定要丧命；跟着毛泽东，一定能成功”的歌谣。
