  　A North China Women's Representative Conference to be Held Next Spring
    Support for the Establishment of a National Democratic Women's Federation
    [Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] As the liberation of Beiping and Tianjin is imminent, and the broad masses of women in the entire North China region celebrate the upcoming complete liberation of North China, the former Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region Women's Federation and the Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei Border Region Women's Federation, in order to adapt to the new situation, unify the North China women's organizations, and respond to the Preparatory Committee of the All-China Liberated Areas Women's Federation's call for a national women's representative conference and the establishment of a National Democratic Women's Federation, formally held an enlarged joint meeting of the two border region women's federations in a certain area of North China on December 15th and 16th. More than 20 representatives from the standing committees of the two regions' women's federations, as well as the North China Bureau, the North China Government, the North China Military Region, the Shijiazhuang Women's Federation, the health school, and the nursery, attended the meeting. Chairman Yang Yunyu reported on the significance of the meeting, pointing out the current victorious situation and the urgent tasks of the women's movement. Everyone unanimously supported the prompt convening of a national women's representative conference and the establishment of a National Democratic Women's Federation. The two border region women's federations will jointly work to immediately prepare for attending the national women's representative conference and for convening the first North China Women's Representative Conference. It was decided that: (1) Due to time constraints, the first North China Women's Representative Conference will be held in the spring of next year after the national women's representative conference concludes, to avoid representatives traveling back and forth in vain; the specific date and location will be determined separately by the preparatory committee. (2) The total number of representatives for the first North China Women's Representative Conference is tentatively set at 210 official representatives and 21 alternate representatives. The number of representatives from each region will be specifically allocated based on local population density, work foundation, and other factors. Finally, everyone unanimously passed a resolution to immediately send a telegram in the name of the two border region women's federations to the Preparatory Committee of the All-China Liberated Areas Women's Federation, expressing warm support for the proposal to convene a national women's representative conference and establish a National Democratic Women's Federation, as well as the various opinions put forward, and hoping to promptly announce the number of national women's representatives and the election methods in order to actively prepare.
