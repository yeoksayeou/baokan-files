[Hebei-Shandong-Henan Telegram] The People's Bank of China, Hebei-Shandong-Henan Branch, held a city work conference at the end of last month to summarize the city banking work in the past six months and determine the future direction and tasks. According to preliminary statistics from several major towns such as Liancheng, Puyang, Qingfeng, Yanggu, Boping, Xianzhuangji, and Niujiaodian, the bank's business situation in the past six months is as follows: new currency deposits (hereinafter the same) of more than 97 million yuan, loans of nearly 50 million yuan, and remittances of more than 67 million yuan. State-owned enterprises accounted for more than 92 percent of deposits, private capital less than 8 percent; fixed deposits accounted for 1.4 percent, and the rest were current deposits; there were no savings deposits at all. Private enterprises accounted for more than 96 percent of loans, state-owned enterprises less than 4 percent, and there were no cooperative business loans at all. In terms of the nature of the loans, industrial loans accounted for only 6.2 percent, and commercial loans accounted for more than 93 percent. The bank's net profit income from handling deposits and loans was only 1,925,200 yuan. 70 to 80 percent of the "state-owned enterprise deposits" do not accrue interest. From the above situation, it can be seen that the bank has made a lot of efforts in urban business in the past six months and has achieved certain significant results. However, due to the vagueness of bank cadres in policy thinking, and some errors and shortcomings in business technology and style, many errors have occurred, which has greatly limited the development of business. The most serious mistake is failing to understand the essential difference between the New Democratic economy and the capitalist economy, and using a large amount of state capital completely unrestricted and indiscriminately to support the development of private capital, abandoning the support for the cooperative economy, and weakening the growth of state capital, which is actually taking the capitalist road. This is a clear manifestation of the right-leaning error after correcting the left-leaning deviation of not lending to private industrial and commercial enterprises at all in the past. Secondly, it is passive and blind, lacking organization and planning. The policy guideline that the New Democratic state bank should only support industries and businesses that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood cannot be grasped, resulting in very few industrial loans, and a part of the commercial loans being taken by speculative merchants for speculation. Thirdly, the interest rate policy of "developing production and benefiting both public and private sectors" has not been correctly grasped, and state capital cannot be accumulated and expanded at the same time in the development of the national economy. This is manifested in the fact that the bank's net profit income from handling deposits and loans is very small.

　　In order to correct the above errors and shortcomings, the meeting pointed out that all cadres must strengthen theoretical and policy study, improve business and technical capabilities, and establish a new style. Determined:

　　First, we should deeply understand the importance of expanding state-owned enterprises and supporting various small cooperative production. In the future, deposits and loans to state-owned enterprises should be carried out in an organized and planned manner. We should understand their business and economic plans so that we can better regulate the use of funds. If there are difficulties, we should help each other solve them. And strive to establish a regular meeting system to study the fund utilization plan for the next month to ensure that the funds of various enterprise departments are used in a planned manner. Vigorously support various small cooperatives and provide loans to small producers through cooperatives to organize their production. For production with development prospects, special attention should be paid to support them so as to prevent them from being crowded out by private capital. At present, there are many warehouses with a large mass base, such as dried fruit shops and ironware stores, which can gradually move towards various cooperative forms. At the same time, through these urban cooperatives, we can help the development of rural cooperation. The difficulty of small producers' sporadic loans can be solved through cooperatives. In the past, we did not know how to support and use cooperatives to organize small producers, because we were afraid of trouble and did not give sporadic loans to small producers and small vendors, which was wrong. For industries and businesses related to the national economy and the people's livelihood, when their capital is insufficient, loans can be granted to help them operate and develop. However, attention must be paid to overcoming the capitalist banking style of not distinguishing its business nature in the past and only starting from obtaining interest.

　　Second, in terms of business development, in terms of deposits, we should vigorously absorb private deposits and fixed savings deposits to expand the source of funds so that we can use funds in a more organized and planned manner. In the past, bank cadres did not have enough understanding of the importance of absorbing private deposits. They believed that public deposits were still not used up, so they relaxed their efforts in this regard. This is mainly due to the fact that our office style and rural style have not been well corrected, and our knowledge of industry and commerce is very lacking. In this way, there is very little contact between the bank and general industrialists and businessmen in business. Therefore, they will not take the initiative to deposit in the bank. Therefore, to develop private deposits, we must change the office style and strengthen the study of industrial and commercial knowledge. In terms of absorbing fixed deposits, attention should be paid to ensuring that depositors get appropriate benefits in terms of interest. For large deposits, we should strive to use some of them as fixed deposits. For state-owned enterprises, we can also absorb fixed deposits from helping them with their business plans.

　　In terms of loans, the focus of industrial and commercial loans this winter should be on developing small iron and wood factories, workshops, handicraftsmen, and shops and warehouses that transport and sell agricultural products and local products that manufacture various agricultural and industrial tools. The second is exporters who sell surplus local products and importers who purchase military and industrial raw materials, as well as industries and businesses that manufacture or transport and sell daily necessities for the masses. All those who meet the above conditions, regardless of whether they are public, private, large, or small, should be given strong support. In particular, for the manufacturing industry of agricultural and industrial tools, which plays an important role in next year's production, we must help them solve various difficulties in a planned manner so that they can develop smoothly. Loans should not be granted to industries and businesses that are purely for consumer goods and have a speculative nature. If some industrialists and businessmen use loans for improper purposes or engage in speculative activities, they should be recovered immediately after discovery to strictly restrict speculative activities and overcome the blindness or semi-blindness in loan work in the past. In addition, in terms of remittance business, due to the rapid development of the situation, the vast liberated areas have been linked together, and remittance work plays a great role in the exchange of materials in the vast areas. All offices should actively carry out remittance business according to the existing plan, and pay attention to actively increasing remittance points and strengthening the remittance work between each district and between districts.

　　Third, in terms of interest rate policy, urban banks should not only protect capital, but also accumulate and expand state capital under the principle of benefiting both public and private sectors. From the perspective of price changes in the first half of the year (an average increase of 15 percent per month), if the deposit interest rate is not appropriately increased, it will be difficult to absorb deposits (especially fixed deposits). Because depositing is not as good as storing in kind. Therefore, the current interest rate policy is not a matter of lowering it. The main problem is how to make appropriate adjustments based on prices and the profit situation of various industries. On the one hand, depositors should have appropriate benefits, and on the other hand, different loan interest rates should be determined according to the different nature of each industry (the size of assistance to the national economy) and the level of profit. Only in this way can funds be continuously accumulated and expanded.

　　In addition to the above, the meeting also made clear conclusions and regulations on urban financial management, cadre training, sound institutions, strengthening learning, establishing a new style, and enhancing discipline. Now, the heads of the main town offices attending the meeting have returned to their work posts and are implementing the spirit of the meeting in their work.

　　中国人民银行冀鲁豫分行
  　检讨贷款右倾偏向
    无限制无分别地贷款给私商
  　决定加强学习理论
    掌握新民主主义经济政策
    【冀鲁豫电】中国人民银行冀鲁豫分行于上月底召开城市工作会议，总结半年来城市银行工作，并确定今后工作方向与任务。该行半年来的业务情况，据联城、濮阳、清丰、阳谷、博平、仙庄集、牛角店等几个主要城镇的初步统计：半年来吸收存款新币（下同）九千七百余万元，发放贷款近五千万元，汇出汇入六千七百余万元。存款中公营企业占百分之九十二以上，私营资本不足百分之八；定期存款占百分之一点四，其余均为活期存款；储蓄存款根本没有。放款中私营占百分之九十六以上，公营不足百分之四，合作经营贷款者根本没有。从贷款性质上说，工业贷款只占百分之六点二，商业贷款达百分之九十三以上。银行在办理存放款中的纯益收入只有一百九十二万五千二百元。存款中百分之七十至八十“公营企业存款”是不出利息的。从上述情况中，可以看出该行半年来在城市业务上已作了不少努力，而且获得一定意义上的成绩。但由于银行干部在政策思想上的模糊，以及经营技术和作风上尚存在一些错误与缺点，所以发生了许多错误，使业务开展受到很大限制。最严重的错误是不了解新民主主义经济与资本主义经济的本质区别，把大量国家资本完全无限制无分别地去扶植私人资本的发展，放弃对合作经济的扶植，且削弱了国家资本的成长，实际上走了资本主义的道路。这是纠正了过去一律不贷款给私人工商业的左倾偏向之后，又产生了右倾错误的一个显明表现。其次，是被动盲目，缺乏组织性与计划性。不能掌握新民主主义的国家银行只应该扶助有利于国计民生的工商业的政策方针，以致工业放款很少，而商业贷款中一部分又被带有投机性的商人拿去进行投机。第三是没有正确掌握“发展生产、公私两利”的利息政策，不能在国民经济的发展中使国家资本同时得到积累壮大。表现在办理存放款中，银行的纯益收入甚少。
    为了纠正上述错误和缺点，会议指出：所有干部必须加强理论与政策学习，提高业务技术能力，并树立新的作风。确定：
    第一，应深刻认识扩大公营企业及扶植各种小型合作生产的重要性，今后对公营企业存放款要做到有组织有计划地进行。应了解其业务、经济计划，以便能更好地调剂运用资金。如有困难，应互助解决。并争取建立定期会议制度，每月互相研究下月的资金运用计划，使各企业部门资金得到有计划的调剂使用。大力扶植各种小型合作社，并通过合作社进行对小生产者的贷款，组织他们生产。对于有发展前途的生产，要特别注意扶植以免他们被私人资本所排挤。目前有不少带有较大群众性的行栈如干果行、铁货店等，可使之逐渐走向各种合作形式，同时通过这些城市合作，帮助农村合作之发展。通过合作社可以解决小生产者零星贷款的困难。过去不知道扶植与利用合作社去组织小生产者，因怕麻烦而不给小生产者、小摊贩零星贷款，是错误的。对有关国计民生的工商业，在其资本不足时，可贷款助其经营与发展。但必须注意克服过去不区别其经营性质，单从获取利息出发的资本主义银行作风。
    第二，在业务开展上，存款方面，应大力吸收私人存款及定期储蓄存款，以扩大资金来源，使能更加有组织有计划地运用资金。过去银行干部对吸收私人存款的重要认识不足。认为公家存款还用不清，故放松了对这方面的努力。这主要由于我们的机关作风和农村作风还未很好纠正，而工商业知识又非常缺乏的原故。这样，使银行和一般工商业者在业务上很少联系。因此他们也就不会主动向银行存款。所以，要发展私人存款，必须转变机关作风和加强工商业知识的学习。在吸收定期存款上，在利息方面应注意使存款人得到适当利益。对于大宗存款，应争取其一部作为定期存款。对公营企业亦可从帮助其经营计划中吸收定期存款。
    在贷款方面，今冬的工商业贷款重点应放在发展制造各种农工用具的小型铁木工厂、作坊、手工业者及运销农产品、土产品的商店行栈上面。其次是推销剩余土产的出口商和采购军工原料的入口商，及制造或运贩群众日用必需品的工商业。凡适合以上条件的，不论其公、私、大、小，均应予以有力支持。特别对明年生产有重要作用的农、工用具制造业，必须有计划地帮助其解决各种困难，使之顺利发展。对于纯消耗品性质和带有投机性质的工商业，不应予以贷款。如有的工商业者贷款后作不正当用途或进行投机活动者，发现后应立即收回，以严格限制投机活动，克服过去在贷款工作上的盲目或半盲目状态。此外在汇兑业务方面，由于形势的迅速发展，广大解放区已联成一片，在广大地区内的物资交流上，汇兑工作起着极大的作用。各处行所应根据现有计划积极开展汇兑业务，并注意主动地增设汇兑点，加强本区互相间及外区间之汇兑工作。
    第三，在利息政策上，城市银行不仅是保本问题，而且应该在公私两利的原则下积累壮大国家资本。从上半年物价变动情形（平均每月上涨百分之十五）来看，如不适当提高存款利息，则吸收存款（特别是定期存款），将感困难。因为存款不如存实。因此目前的利息政策还不是降低的问题。主要问题在于如何根据物价及各业利润情形进行适当调整。一方面使存款者有适当利益，另一方面也要根据各行业性质的不同（对国民经济帮助大小）及利润高低，确定不同的贷款利息。这样才能使资金不断积累扩大。
    除上述各项外，会议并对城市金融管理、培养干部、健全机构、加强学习、树立新作风、以及增强纪律性等问题作出明确结论与规定。现与会各主要城镇办事处主任已分返工作岗位，把会议精神贯彻到工作中去。
