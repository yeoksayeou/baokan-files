　　【Report from this newspaper】Jizhong Daobao News: In Renhe Wenxiang Village, the conclusion of land reform was closely integrated with party rectification. For major issues such as revising class designations and compensating for wrongful struggles, the branch first conducted discussions to unify ideological understanding; it also enhanced the awareness of party members, encouraged them to return over-appropriated fruits, and established the branch's prestige, making it the leadership core for concluding land reform. When reviewing and correcting wrongly designated class statuses, the branch committee conducted discussions and also convened party member group meetings to expand the discussion. When discussing the class status of rich peasant Li Guilin, Zhang Yonglu said he was a middle peasant. Zhao Fugui said, "He was still hiring long-term laborers during the review, how can he be considered a middle peasant?" Wang Yaoseng said, "He can only be reclassified as a middle peasant if he has been working himself and has stopped exploiting others for three full years. We can't just change his class status because he hasn't hired labor this year." After debate, everyone finally agreed that this household of Li Guilin's had been exploiting hired laborers before last year, and the income from exploitation exceeded 25% of the family's total income, so he should be a rich peasant. Although he didn't hire long-term labor this year, it hasn't been three years yet, so his class status should not be changed.

　　In this village branch, some individual party members had been selfish and appropriated too much fruit in the past, which caused great dissatisfaction among ordinary party members and the masses. This time, before dealing with floating wealth, a general meeting of all party members was first convened for discussion and criticism. Party member Wang Yaoseng said, "The masses are all saying that Gao Seng pushed out bad land and exchanged it for good land. Gao Seng should make a good self-criticism." Jia Shuyi said, "Many people are saying that Comrade Gao Seng got good land and things, but he doesn't do any work!" Most party members criticized Gao Seng's selfish thoughts and behavior. Gao Seng made a self-criticism, admitted his mistakes, and after the meeting, he returned the six mu of extra land, two quilts, a watch, a trailer, etc., for distribution to the peasants. Jia Chunlin also voluntarily returned the extra pots, rakes, and forks, etc., to the farmers' association. Gao Shude also said, "As party members, we must play an exemplary and leading role in implementing all party policies and work, and we must never be selfish and let the masses say we are wrong."

　　任河文香村结束土改与整党结合
  　支部成为领导核心
    【本报讯】冀中导报消息：任河文香村，结束土改与整党紧密结合进行，对改订成份、补偿错斗等重大问题，先在支部讨论，统一思想认识；并提高党员觉悟，退出多占果实，树立支部威信，成为结束土改的领导核心。在审查改正错订成份时，支委会进行讨论；又召开了党员小组会，展开讨论。讨论到富农李桂林的成份时，张永禄说他是中农。赵福桂说：“复查时他还雇着长工呢，怎么能算中农？”王耀僧说：“他自个劳动，停止剥削满了三年，才能改成中农呢，不能光看他今年没雇活就改成份。”经过争论，最后大家一致认为李桂林这户，去年以前都是剥削雇工，剥削来的东西超过了全家总收入的百分之二十五，应该是富农。今年虽说他没雇长活，可是还不够三年，不应改变成份。
    这村支部里有个别党员，过去自私自利多占了果实，以致惹起一般党员和群众的极大不满。这次在处理浮财前，首先召开了全体党员大会，进行讨论，开展批评。党员王耀僧说：“群众都反映高僧把坏地推出去换成了好地，高僧应该很好的检讨检讨。”贾书意说：“好些人都说高僧同志好地也分啦，东西也得啦，可是也不干工作啦！”大多数党员都对高僧这种自私自利的思想行为提出了批评。高僧作了检讨，承认了错误，会后就把多分的六亩地、两床被子、表、拖车等，都拿了出来，让农民分配了。贾春林与自动的把多分的锅、耙、杈子等拿了出来，交给了农会。高树德还说：“咱们党员，在执行党的一切政策和工作上，都要起模范和带头作用才对，绝不能自私自利叫群众说不是。”
