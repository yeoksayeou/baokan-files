　　【North Yue News】 The Pingshan County Party Committee held a meeting of district party secretaries and civil affairs assistants for three days starting on the 21st of last month to discuss actively completing the glorious task of military recruitment amidst the great victories of the People's Liberation Army. First, the current new situation was reported, and then group discussions were held. During the discussions, the initial difficulties identified were: 1. Village-level organizational structures were not responsive, unable to communicate effectively up and down. Some new village cadres were unsure about the current winter rectification campaign and were unwilling to take responsibility; old cadres were waiting and watching. Village branches were not sound enough to establish core leadership. 2. There was extreme democratization in villages. Democratic consultations were not guaranteed. 3. Some districts had not completed party rectification, and grain requisitions had not been completed, so they were not ideologically prepared for military recruitment.

　　After discussion at the general meeting, everyone agreed that these were not significant difficulties and could be completely overcome, and the following effective solutions were reached: 1. The experience from the requisition work should be accepted, combined with the central work, and bold use should be made of old party member cadres who have made minor mistakes. New cadres should be supported, organizations should be adjusted in the work, branch leadership should be improved, and ideological obstacles should be removed by solving practical problems; the enthusiasm of party members should be raised. For example, in Tianxing, Third District, the district party committee quickly revised the class designations and dealt with floating wealth, allowing party members who had been punished in the past to fully express their opinions, while also educating them that revenge was strictly forbidden. The branch was re-elected, the cadres were adjusted through the masses, and the confidence of party members and the masses was enhanced, greatly changing the atmosphere in the whole village. Two-thirds of the grain requisition was completed in three or four days. Other examples, such as Huikou in Ninth District and Hanhu River in Sixth District, proved that this was a good experience. This experience can be fully utilized in military recruitment mobilization to ensure the completion of the task.

　　2. Emphasize that joining the army is the glorious duty of young people, combining individual mobilization with democratic consultation; summon the parents of those subject to democratic consultation, persuade them ideologically, and obtain guarantees. Also, pay attention to solving their family difficulties. At the same time, each district should have key areas where the district secretary and district head personally take the lead to break through one village and gain experience. For example, Sixth District completed the requisition work relatively well this time because the district secretary and district head personally worked on opening up one village, creating experience to promote the entire district. It is also important to mobilize party members to take the lead and for cadres to play a backbone role model.

　　3. Carry out various propaganda activities: The county has organized primary school teachers and education assistants to write a large number of military recruitment songs, clapper talks, drum lyrics, short plays... and mobilized complete primary schools to draw large maps to explain the victorious situation of the times. When complete primary schools in each district hold mass meetings, they are responsible for organizing small pre-meeting propaganda, yangko dances, and mobilizing village theater troupes to cooperate in performances. The whole county has decided that the 1st to the 7th will be Propaganda Week, and each district can convene mass meetings at the district level.

　　4. For villages where requisitions have not been completed, ten more central subdistrict cadres can be added to help carry out shock work, so that district cadres can concentrate their efforts on completing the military recruitment work.

　　After discussion at the general meeting, everyone clarified the favorable conditions for carrying out the military recruitment campaign in the new victorious situation, and their confidence was very high. They planned how to mobilize and organize all forces after returning to their districts to ensure the completion of this glorious task. Each district also issued challenges to each other, with the following conditions: (1) Strive to complete the task ahead of schedule and exceed the quota. (2) Ensure good quality, with party members accounting for 25 percent. (3) Adhere to a reporting system every two days, with each district cadre who can write contributing at least one article. (4) District cadres guarantee not to ask for leave to go home.

　　平山订出参军宣传周
  　保证完成光荣任务
    【北岳讯】平山县委于上月二十一日以三天时间召开了区委书记、民政助理员等会议，讨论在解放军大胜利中积极完成光荣的参军任务。首先报告了目前新的形势，并分组进行酝酿。在酝酿中最初大家感到困难的是：一、村级组织机构不灵，不能上达下应，有些村新干部对今冬整党摸不着底，不愿负责；老干部等待观望。村支部不健全，无法树立核心领导。二、村内有极端民主化现象。民主公议没有保证。三、有些区因未整党，公粮尚未完成，对参军无思想准备。
    经大会讨论后，一致认为这些都不算什么困难，完全能够克服，并得出以下几个有效的解决办法：一、应接受征收工作中的经验，结合中心工作，大胆的使用错误不大的老党员干部，扶植新干部，在工作中调整组织，健全支部领导，并以解决实际问题打通思想；提高党员积极性。如三区区委在田兴迅速的改订了成份，处理了浮财，让过去受过处分的党员充分发表意见，而又教育他们绝不许报复，重新改选支部，通过群众调整了干部，党员群众信心提高，全村空气大为不同，公粮在三四天内完成了三分之二。其他如九区的会口，六区的寒虎河均证明这是个好的经验。参军动员中，可充分利用这一经验保证完成任务。
    二、强调参军是青年光荣的义务，个别动员与民主公议结合；对公议对象召集其家长会议，说通思想，进行保证。并注意解决其家庭困难问题。同时各区应有重点的由区书区长亲自下手突破一村，取得经验。如六区这次征收工作完成得较好，就是区书区长亲自搞开了一个村，创造经验推动全区的。其中发动党员带头，干部起骨干模范作用亦很重要。
    三、进行各种宣传活动：县已组织小学教员、教育助理员大量写参军歌、快板、鼓词、短剧……并动员完小画大幅地图，说明时局的胜利形势。各区完小在开全区群众大会的时候，担任组织会前小型宣传，秧歌舞，并动员村剧团配合演出。全县决定一号至七号为宣传周，各区可召开以区为单位的群众大会。
    四、对于征收尚未完成村可增加十个中心小区干部，帮助进行突击，使区干部们能集中全力完成参军工作。
    经过大会讨论后，都明确了在新的胜利形势下进行参军运动的有利条件，信心很高，纷纷计划回区后如何动员组织一切力量，保证完成这一光荣任务。各区并互相提出挑战，挑战条件为：（１）提前争取超数完成任务。（２）保证质量好，党员要占百分之二十五。（３）坚持两天一报告制度，每个会写的区干部最少写稿一篇。（４）区干部保证不请假回家。
