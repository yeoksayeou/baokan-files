　　Taiyue Xinhua Daily Publishes Article Criticizing and Correcting
  　Formalism in Investigation Work
    [Taiyue Electric] Taiyue Xinhua Daily recently discovered from reports in several areas that the conclusion of land reform work saw numbers being treated as the sole basis for understanding situations and resolving problems. Therefore, it published an article criticizing and correcting this. It stated: Currently, there is a method of understanding the situation in land reform work that only pays attention to the investigation of population, land, houses, and agricultural implements, treating the investigation of population, land, and houses as the only situation. This method is obviously wrong because: First, this method can only tell us the possession of means of production of each household, but it cannot tell us how each household uses these means of production (such as renting out, hiring workers to cultivate, self-cultivation); and the usage is precisely the standard for us to determine which class they belong to, which is also the starting point of our policy. If we cannot distinguish this point, we will confuse the battle lines. Second, these numbers cannot tell us the situation of mass mobilization, the degree of mass awareness, and the elimination of feudalism in the economic and political aspects. And this situation is precisely the prerequisite for us to determine our work guidelines, tasks, and methods. If we do not understand this situation, the determined guidelines and tasks will not be correct. This method of only looking at the possession situation is a reflection of absolute egalitarianism in work methods. Associated with this method of understanding the situation is an erroneous method of handling problems in land reform, that is, not starting from the specific situation of each household to determine different handling methods, but only based on the current land and population number of a household to handle it. For example, in the resettlement or struggle against landlords, no distinction is made between large, medium, and small landlords, no distinction is made between the severity of their crimes, and no distinction is made between the different degrees of hatred the masses have for them to make different treatments. Instead, they are generally treated according to the amount of possession. For the compensation of the existing poor and hired peasants, regardless of whether they should have been distributed but were not, whether they were downgraded landlords and rich peasants, whether they were long-term laborers, or vagrant elements, all are treated according to their amount of possession. For the middle peasants whose interests have been infringed upon, no distinction is made between the causes and the process of the infringement, who committed the infringement, who shared the fruits, and what the attitude of the masses is. They are generally treated according to the possession situation. For cadres who over-occupied the fruits, no distinction is made between the nature and circumstances of the matter, but they are generally treated according to the possession situation or how much they over-occupied. In this way, each problem cannot be handled reasonably and cannot gain the sympathy of the masses.
    So, how should we understand the situation? First, we must understand the situation from the production methods of each household, that is, the production relations in rural areas, the relationship between peasants and landlords, the degree of awareness and organization of peasants, the living conditions, the political status, and the elimination of feudalism by landlords. After entering the rural areas, we must first understand whether there are landlords and rich peasants in the village, see how much land and houses they occupy, what methods they use for production, whether they are landlords and rich peasants, how much they occupied in the past and how much they occupy now, how they are politically, whether they have been struggled against, how much they have been struggled out, how much they currently have, and whether they should continue to be struggled against. On the peasant side, we must understand the degree of awareness of the peasants, the process of the struggle, the current living conditions, whether the distribution of fruits is unfair, whether there are middle peasants whose interests have been infringed upon, who committed the infringement, why they committed the infringement, and what the situation is after the infringement; whether there are poor and hired peasants who should have been distributed fruits but have not received them, why they have not received them, and so on. The investigation of land and population numbers can only explain the problem when combined with the above situation, and different methods can be adopted according to different situations to correctly handle the situation, handle it reasonably, and obtain the support of the majority of the masses.

　　太岳新华日报著文批评纠正
  　调查工作中的形式主义
    【太岳电】太岳新华日报最近从若干地区报导中，发现在结束土地改革的工作中，有单纯把数目字作为唯一的情况与处理问题的唯一根据，因此著文批评纠正。略称：现在在土改工作中有一种了解情况的方法，就是：只注意人口、土地、房屋及农具的调查，把人口、土地、房屋的调查作为唯一的情况，这种方法显然是错误的。因为：第一、这种方法只能告诉我们各户生产资料占有情形，但不能告诉我们每户对这些生产资料的使用情形（如出租、雇用工人耕植、自耕）；而使用情形恰好是我们判定其属于何种阶级的标准，也就是我们政策的出发点。如果不能分别这一点，就会把斗争的阵营混乱起来。第二、这些数目字不能告诉我们群众发动的情形，群众的觉悟程度，封建在经济上和政治上消灭的情形。而这种情形，又恰好是我们确定工作方针、任务和方法的前提。不了解这种情形，确定的方针任务就不会正确。这种只看占有情形的方法，又是绝对平均思想在工作方法上的一种反映。与这种了解情况的方法相关联的，还有土改中处理问题时一种错误的方法，就是不从每户的具体情况出发，决定不同的处理方法，而只是根据当前某户土地、人口数目来处理。譬如对地主的安置或斗争，不分大、中、小，不分罪恶大小，不分群众对他们不同的痛恨程度来作不同的处理，而只是一般地按照占有数量来处理和对现有的贫雇农的填补，则不管是应分未分的、地富下降的、常年劳动的，或是游民分子，一律按照其占有数量来处理。对被侵犯的中农，也不分别侵犯的原因和侵犯的经过，是什么人侵犯的，果实是什么人分去，群众的态度如何，只是一般地按照占有情形来处理。对干部多占果实，也不分别其性质与情节之不同，只是一般地按照占有情形或多占多少来处理。这样就不能把每个问题处理得入情入理，也就不能获得群众的同情。
    那么，究竟应怎样了解情况呢？第一、必须从每户的生产方式上，即农村的生产关系上，农民与地主的关系上，农民的觉悟程度与组织程度、生活情形、政治地位，和地主封建消灭的情形等来了解情况。进入农村以后，首先必须了解该村是否有地主富农，看他们占有土地房屋多少，用什么方式进行生产，是否地主富农，过去占有多少现在占有多少，政治上如何，是否被斗争过，斗出多少，现有多少，应否继续斗争；在农民方面，则必须了解农民的觉悟程度如何，斗争的经过如何，现在的生活情形，果实分配是否不公，是否有被侵犯的中农，什么人侵犯的，为什么侵犯时，侵犯后情形如何；是否有应分果实而未分到果实的贫雇农，他们为什么没有分到等等。土地人口数目字的调查，只有与以上情况结合起来，才能说明问题，根据不同情形采取不同的办法去正确处理，处理得入情入理，取得多数群众的拥护。
