　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, December 27th: TASS reports: The trade unions of coal industry workers in the two major regions of eastern and western Soviet Union have recently decided to jointly allocate 3,180,000 rubles to aid the striking coal miners of France and their families. In a letter to the French National Federation of Miners, Soviet miners said: Comrades: We accept your appeal to the workers of all countries, and we are deeply moved by your appeal. Soviet miners warmly respond to your call to strengthen international workers' solidarity. The Central Committee of the Trade Union of Coal Industry Workers in the Western Region of the Soviet Union and the Central Committee of the Trade Union of Coal Industry Workers in the Eastern Region of the Soviet Union have decided to allocate 3,180,000 rubles to relieve the striking French miners and their families in response to your appeal. We commend your heroic struggle, and we are convinced that despite all kinds of difficulties and persecutions, the heroic French miners will surely achieve complete victory. Please rest assured that the miners of the Soviet Union will always be with you! Long live international worker solidarity!
    In other news: The French government and the national coal mine management's persecution of miners and trade union leaders has aroused strong protests from the miners. Coal miners in Saint-Étienne have decided to stop work one hour before quitting time to protest the illegal sentencing of their representative to three months in prison and a fine of 40,000 francs. The national coal mine management has announced that it will cancel all bonuses and dismiss all miners who leave the mine. However, all the miners still went on strike for one hour on time. Workers in some mines in the South Loire province also stopped working one hour before the end of their shift to protest the unreasonable sentencing of their trade union secretary. The National Federation of Miners has also lodged a strong protest against the illegal arrest of its secretary.

　　苏矿工拨款三百余万卢布
  　援助法国罢工矿工
    【新华社陕北二十七日电】塔斯社讯：苏联东西部两大地区采煤工业工人职工会，顷决定联合拨款三百一十八万卢布，捐助法国罢工的煤矿工人及其家属。苏联矿工在致法国全国矿工联盟的信中说：同志们：我们接受你们对各国工人的呼吁，你们的呼吁使我们大为感动。苏联矿工热烈响应你们对加强国际工人团结的号召。苏联西部地区采煤工业工人职工会中委会及苏联东部地区采煤工业工人职工会中委员，决定拨款三百一十八万卢布救济罢工的法国矿工及其家庭，以回答你们的呼吁。我们盛赞你们的英雄斗争，我们深信尽管有各种困难和迫害，英勇的法国矿工必将获得完全胜利。请你们放心，苏联的矿工将永远和你们在一起！国际工人团结万岁！
    又讯：法国政府及国营煤矿管理部对矿工及职工会领袖的迫害，已引起矿工的坚决抗议。圣德田煤矿工人决定在放工之前一小时停工，以抗议其代表被监禁三个月、罚款四万法郎的非法判决。国营煤矿管理部曾宣布将取消所有离矿工人的奖金并解雇他们。但是，全部矿工仍按时罢工一小时。南罗亚尔省一些矿坑的工人，也在下班以前停工一小时，以抗议其职工会的书记被无理判决。全国矿工联盟为抗议其书记的非法被捕，亦已提出强力抗议。
