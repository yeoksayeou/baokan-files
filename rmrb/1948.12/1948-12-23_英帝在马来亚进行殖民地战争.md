　　British Imperialism Wages Colonial War in Malaya
    Bai Lin

    Malaya, a land of rubber and tin, is the latest location of the British imperialist colonial war.
    Weapons and troops are being rapidly transported from Britain, Australia, the Middle East, and Hong Kong to Singapore to suppress the people. The British police force formerly stationed in Palestine, along with its captain, General Gray, are also among the troops sent by Britain.

    British Malaya currently has a population of over four million. It is the largest producer of natural rubber and tin ore in the world. The Malayan economy is based on rubber plantations and tin mining. Secondary products include rice, coconuts, tapioca, sugar cane, and pepper.

    The All-Malaya Federation of Trade Unions, with over 300,000 members and originally a member of the World Federation of Trade Unions, has now been declared illegal. Many union leaders have been shot and killed by British military police, including Chen Kang (transliteration), chairman of the Johor Rubber Industry Union. In addition, organizations deemed illegal by the authorities include the Veterans Association of the People's Anti-Japanese Army, the Communist Party, and the New Democratic Youth League.

    British planes fly over various locations dropping leaflets, threatening with the death penalty anyone who supports any "illegal" democratic organizations.

    Banning people's organizations and eliminating all democrats is proceeding in parallel with British army and air force operations and absurd propaganda. The BBC and Malayan newspapers say that the British military action is not suppressing a mass movement but is "bandit suppression." This is a phrase taken from Goebbels' dictionary, because he always falsely called guerrillas "bandits."

    Just as British newspapers and radio stations were slandering Malayan democrats, Colonial Secretary Mr. Jones admitted in the House of Commons on July 8th that the war in Malaya was a mass war. He said, "The war we see in Malaya today is similar in nature to the one currently being waged in China." In other words, the Labor Party's Colonial Secretary confirmed that British imperialism and its "socialist" government are currently waging a colonial war against the Malayan people.

    British General Boucher, commander-in-chief of the British forces in Malaya, recently used terms like "Liberation Army" and "Liberated Areas" for the first time in a report to the Legislative Council.

    In an interview with a United Press reporter, Boucher believed that it would take approximately fifteen months to fight the Malayan people.

    The war waged by British imperialism against the Malayan national liberation movement, like all colonial wars it has waged, is unbelievably brutal.

    Burning houses aims to force local people to become homeless, and depriving people of their main food—rice—is an attempt to subdue them with hunger.

    Malaya has always been a treasure trove for London to take from at will. Last year alone, Malayan rubber earned London $260 million. According to some estimates, British investment in Malayan rubber plantations alone amounts to £200 million.

    In addition to some large trading banks in the City of London, there are also many old firms engaged in rubber trading. For example, the Quaker family of Harrison and Crosfield has assets of £2.5 million. The directors of Harrison are also directors of 56 companies, all of which have business relationships with rubber plantations. These directors also serve as managers of 50 rubber plantations, with a total capital of £11.5 million. The gold obtained from the blood and sweat of the Malayan people is constantly flowing into the treasuries of British financial magnates and British bankers.

    However, the great significance of Malaya to British imperialism lies not only in its amazing source of profit but even more in its strategic significance.

    The United States is the world's largest consumer of rubber and tin, but it has neither natural rubber nor tin mines itself.

    The production of natural rubber and tin is entirely monopolized by British capital. The International Rubber Regulation Committee, which stipulates prices and quantities, has long been an organization dominated by the British. Tin prices are also determined unilaterally by the British.

    As long as the above-mentioned monopoly capital remains, Britain will never have to worry about a constant flow of money.

    But the Americans, contrary to the "generosity" of the Marshall Plan crowd, are resentful of the British monopoly. Rubber is the subject of the fiercest Anglo-American rivalry, and it was so in the past and remains so now.

    In order to break the British monopoly on rubber, the Americans are determined to pay any price and invest heavily in establishing synthetic rubber plants, with a total investment of approximately $800 million. By 1946, the United States produced nearly one million tons of synthetic rubber, and 75 percent of the rubber used in American industry came from synthetic rubber plants.

    The United States' consumption of domestically produced rubber is vastly different from before the war, when the rubber supplied by British monopoly capital accounted for nine-tenths of US needs.

    Before the war, Britain's global monopoly on tin mining and smelting enjoyed the same golden age as its monopoly on rubber.

    The two major firms, British Tin Investment Company and London Tin Corporation, operate their monopoly tin business in Malaya, with a combined capital of no less than millions of pounds. Because the United States has no tin mines, and its massive canning and automobile industries consume half of the world's tin production, most of which comes from Malaya.

    As early as the beginning of this century, the Americans wanted to attack the British tin monopoly. They opened a tin smelting plant in San Francisco, importing tin ore from the Far East for self-refining. However, because the tin mines were mostly located within the British Empire, British monopoly capital immediately imposed high export taxes on tin ore, seeking to prohibit through taxation. This eliminated the American imperialist opposition and foiled its initial conspiracy to break free from British control.

    The Second World War gave the United States a long-awaited opportunity. After the Japanese imperialists invaded Malaya and cut off the local supply of tin to various countries, the US government built a large tin smelting plant in Longfeng, Texas. After the war, the Americans used their political pressure to abolish tin export taxes in Malaya. The role of imperialists has thus changed. The era when tin prices were entirely dictated to the US by British monopoly capital has passed, replaced by the present situation in which Americans have the right to speak on the determination of tin prices. In 1947, the Texas plant smelted 30,000 tons of tin. This year's output will be even higher, because as a result of the coup in Siam, the Americans can directly transport tin ore from Siam to this smelting plant.

    Due to these developments in the rubber and tin industries, British imperialist monopoly capital's half-century-long control over these two major raw materials has now been defeated by its American rival. American imperialism has not only defeated British imperialism in these areas, but has also defeated British imperialism in other areas. The US dollars earned by Britain have now been greatly reduced. Conversely, Britain has even been forced to buy American goods at high prices, while Americans can set prices and buy rubber and tin from British imperial areas. As a result, the price of natural rubber fell by a third last year.

    All of this is the ugly reality behind the bloody events currently taking place in Malaya. After being attacked by its rival, British imperialists are now trying to attack the living standards of the Malayan people in order to maintain their profits.

    During the period of Japanese occupation, the outstanding elements of the Malayan people, unlike those rubber plantation owners, carried out a heroic anti-Japanese underground struggle. This underground struggle was carried out under the leadership of the Communist Party, and the people recognized the value of organization. In the years after the war, the urgent struggle to improve the economy has merged with the struggle for people's freedom and national independence. After working together to expel the Japanese invaders, the Malayan people sought their own liberation from the shackles of British imperialism. However, the Attlee-Bevin "socialist" government colluded with rubber plantation owners, bankers, and colonists to form a united front, waging a large-scale colonial war against the Malayan people.

　　英帝在马来亚进行殖民地战争
    白林作
    树胶和锡产地的马来亚是最近英帝国主义的殖民地战争地点。
    武器和部队从英国、澳洲、中东及香港急速运到新加坡去反人民。原驻巴勒斯坦英警队及其队长格莱将军亦在英国派援部队之内。
    英属马来亚现有四百余万人口。这是全世界天然树胶和锡矿的最大出产地。马来亚经济是奠基于树胶园和采冶锡矿上面的。次产物为大米、椰子、树薯、蔗糖和胡椒。
    拥有三十多万会员的全马来亚工会联合会，原为世界工联会员之一，现竟被宣布为非法，工会领袖多人且遭英方军警枪杀，被害者计有柔佛树胶业工会主席陈康（译音）。此外，经当局认为非法团体的尚有人民抗日军退伍同志联合会、共产党及新民主青年同盟。
    英机飞临各地空投传单，用死刑来威胁任何支援一切“非法”的民主团体人士。
    封禁人民团体与清除一切民主人士是和英陆空军行动及荒诞宣传同时并行的。英国广播公司和马来亚报纸就这样说，英军行动并非镇压群众运动，而是“剿匪”。这是从戈培尔公司的字典里翻出来的一句话，因为他总是把游击队诬称为“匪”。
    正当英国报纸和电台都在污蔑马来亚民主人士的时候，殖民地大臣琼斯先生却于七月八日在下院承认马来亚的战争是群众性的战争。他说：“我们今天所见的马来亚战争，其性质正与中国现所进行的一样。”换句话说，工党的殖民地大臣证实了英帝国主义及其“社会主义”政府现正进行着反马来亚人民的殖民地战争。
    马来亚英军总司令布彻尔将军最近在立法会议的报告中却第一次用过“解放军”和“解放区”这一类词汇。
    布氏在会见合众社记者时认为，对马来亚人民作战大约需要十五个月。
    英帝国主义反对马来亚民族解放运动所进行的战争，正象一向进行的一切殖民地战争一样，其残酷程度简直令人难以置信。
    烧毁庐舍的目的是迫使当地人民无家可归，剥夺人民的主要食物——大米，是图以饥饿强使他们降伏。
    马来亚向来就是伦敦予取予用的宝库。只拿去年一年来说，马来亚的橡胶就给伦敦赚了二亿六千万美元。根据某些估计数字，英国仅对马来亚树胶园一项的投资即达二亿英镑。
    除了伦敦市一些大贸易银行外，还有好些进行树胶买卖的老行号，象哈里逊与格罗斯斐尔德的桂格族一家即拥资二百五十万英镑。哈里逊的董事们同时也是五十六家公司的董事，而这些公司都是和树胶园发生商务关系的。这批董事还担任五十个树胶园的经理，资金合计为一千一百五十万镑。马来亚人血汗所得的金子不断地流入英国财阀和英国银行家的财库。
    然而马来亚对于英帝国主义的重大意义还不限于它的惊人利源，而更在于它的战略意义。
    美国是全世界消费树胶和锡最多的国家，但它本身既无天然树胶也没有锡矿。
    天然树胶和锡的产制全归英国独占资本所垄断。规定价格与分量的国际树胶调节委会早已成为英方支配的机构。锡价起落也由英方以独断方式规定之。
    只要上述的独占资本依然存在，英国总不愁没有金元滔滔滚进来的。
    可是美国人呢，却大反乎马歇尔之流的“慷慨”，他们都恼恨英方的垄断。树胶是英美角逐最烈的东西，过去如此，现在也仍然如此。
    美国人为了打破英国人的垄断树胶，决心支付任何代价，大大地投资设立人造树胶厂，投资总额共约八亿美元。迄一九四六年，美国人造树胶的产量已近百万吨，同时美国工业上所用的树胶中，百分之七十五来自人造树胶厂的成品。
    美国消耗自制树胶一事已与战前截然不同，当时英垄断资本所供应者竟占美国需用十分之九。
    战前英国对采锡冶锡的世界性垄断是和它对树胶的垄断过着同样鼎盛时代的。
    英锡投资公司与伦敦锡公司两大行号在马来亚经营其垄断锡业，资本合计不下千百万镑。美国因为没有锡矿，而其庞大罐头工业及汽车工业又须消费世界锡产量的一半，其中大部分就是取自马来亚。
    迄本世纪开端，美国人便想打击英锡独占业。他们在旧金山开设一家冶锡厂，由远东输入锡苗自行制炼。但因锡矿大都位于英帝国辖区之内，英国垄断资本立即施行锡矿高额出口税，以求寓禁于征。这样一来便消灭了美帝国主义的作对，使其解除英方操纵的初步阴谋归于失败。
    第二次世界大战给了美国一个久经盼望的机会，当日本帝国主义者侵入马来亚并切断当地对世界各国供应锡产之后，美国政府才在得克萨斯州的龙封建立一家大冶锡厂。战后，美国人又运用其政治压力使马来亚废除锡的出口税，帝国主义者角色至此遂起变化，原先锡价全由英垄断资本对美发号施令的时代已成过去，而为现在美国人对锡价的决定发言权所代替了。一九四七年得克萨斯厂冶锡已达三万吨。今年产量将更提高，因为暹罗政变的结果，美国人可以直接自暹载运锡苗到这家冶锡厂来。
    由于树胶及锡业方面的这些发展，英帝国主义垄断资本对于这两种主要原料历半世纪之久的控制，现已为其美国敌手打败了。美帝国主义不仅在这些方面打败了英帝国主义，他方面亦同样地打败了英帝国主义。英国所赚的美金现已大减，倒转过来，英国竟至被迫以高价购买美货，而美国人却可自订价格从英帝国地区买进树胶和锡，这样的结果，去年天然树胶的价格就跌落了三分之一。
    凡此种种便是目前马来亚发生流血事件的幕后的丑恶现实。英帝国主义者被其敌手打击之后，现正力图进攻马来亚人民的生活标准，以求保持其利润。
    日寇占领期内，马来亚人民的优秀分子不同于那批树胶园主，他们进行过英勇抗敌的地下斗争。这种地下斗争是在共产党领导下进行的，人民由此认识了有组织的价值。战后几年来，迫切需要改善经济的斗争已与争取人民自由、民族独立的斗争汇合。马来亚人民自从协力驱逐日寇之后，即求自身解放摆脱英帝国主义的扼轭。然而艾德礼——贝文的“社会主义者”政府却与树胶园主、银行家及殖民者勾结成联合阵线，进行着大规模的反马来亚人民的殖民地战争。（楚歌译自“持久和平与人民民主”杂志第十七期）
