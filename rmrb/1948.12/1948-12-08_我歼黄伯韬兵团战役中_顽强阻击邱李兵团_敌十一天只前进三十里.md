　　【Xinhua News Agency, Huaihai Front, 6th】When a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army blocked the Chiang bandit Qiu Qingquan and Li Qiang's corps from Xuzhou, who were attempting to reinforce Huang Botao's corps in the middle of last month, they fought tenaciously, inflicting serious blows on the enemy, and ensuring that fraternal units completely annihilated Huang Botao's corps. In the battle, commanders and fighters of the blocking forces were able to endure hunger and cold and overcome difficulties. When a certain unit blocked the bandit Qiu's 5th Army at the Xueshan position on the 14th, the commanders and fighters had not rested for five days and nights, but after receiving the order, the soldiers ignored their fatigue and the cold, built fortifications in the artillery fire, and a large number of heroic and tenacious examples of taking the initiative to attack emerged during the battle. On November 15th, a part of the Chiang bandit army, under the cover of airplanes and tanks, launched an attack on our army's Lijiaqiao position east of Xuzhou. Our army rose up to meet the attack. During the battle, rocket launcher shooters Pu Bingrong and Tian Xiaoqing each fired nine rounds, hitting six each, destroying one enemy tank and damaging two, forcing the enemy to not advance a single step for three hours. During the blocking action at Xueshan on the 14th, the second platoon of the second company of a certain regiment repelled three charges by an enemy battalion on a small hill in front of the position. Platoon leader Wu was wounded twice, but continued to direct the battle. In the final counterattack by the first platoon of the company, they used stones to repel the enemy. Soldier Zhang Longxi of the third squad set up a machine gun on the destroyed fortifications, blocked a fork in the road, and killed more than 30 enemies. On the 14th, the 5th Army, with two regiments of troops in batches under the cover of seven tanks, advanced towards the Qianchangzhuang position of the seventh company of the third battalion of a certain regiment of our army. Combat hero Wang Yun continuously knocked down more than 20 enemies when the enemy approached within 20 meters. At this time, the enemy surged forward, and Comrade Zhang Decheng immediately jumped out of the fortifications and fought the enemy with bayonets. Also, because our army's heavy machine gun malfunctioned, the soldiers blocked the enemy with single guns. Soldier Wang Yun threw grenades directly at the enemy, overwhelming them. The blocking action lasted from 9:00 in the morning to 12:00 at night, killing or wounding more than 800 enemies. Under the strong blocking action of our army, the enemy only advanced 30 li in eleven days. Our army successfully completed the blocking mission.

　　我歼黄伯韬兵团战役中
  　顽强阻击邱李兵团
  　敌十一天只前进三十里
    【新华社淮海前线六日电】解放军某部于上月中旬阻击由徐州东援黄伯韬兵团之蒋匪邱清泉与李强两兵团时，顽强作战，予敌以严重打击，保证了兄弟部队全歼黄伯韬兵团。在作战中，阻援部队指战员能忍饥耐寒，克服困难。某部十四日在薛山阵地阻击匪邱兵团第五军时，指战员已经五昼夜未得休息，但接到命令后，战士们不顾疲劳与寒冷，在炮火中构筑掩体，在作战中并涌现了大批英勇顽强主动出击的范例。十一月十五日蒋匪军一部在飞机坦克掩护下，向我徐州东李家桥阵地进攻，我军乃奋起迎击，战斗中，火箭筒射手蒲丙荣及田小清每人发射九发，各命中六发，击毁敌坦克一辆，击伤两辆，迫使敌三小时未得前进一步。十四日薛山阻击中，某团二连二排在阵地前沿的小山头上，打退敌一个营兵力的三次冲锋，吴排长两次负伤，仍继续指挥作战。该连一排最后反击中，用石头打退敌人。三班战士张龙喜把机枪架在毁坏的工事上，封锁一个岔口，打死三十多个敌人。十四日第五军以两个团兵力分批在七辆坦克掩护下，向我某团三营七连之前场庄阵地进犯，战斗英雄王云当敌人接近至二十米达处时，连续击倒二十多个敌人。这时敌人拥来，章德成同志即当先跳出工事与敌人拼刺刀。又因我军重机枪发生故障，战士们即单人单枪阻击敌人。战士王云用手榴弹向敌人直掼，将敌人压倒下去。阻击自早晨九时至夜晚十二时，毙伤敌八百余人。在我军坚强阻击下，十一天内敌仅前进三十里。我军胜利完成阻击任务。
