　　Mass Blackboard
  　Encircle 200,000 of Chiang Kai-shek's Bandits
    Xuzhou is the gateway to Nanjing, and now this gateway has been occupied by the People's Liberation Army. When the PLA's mighty forces arrayed themselves towards Xuzhou, Chiang Kai-shek's bandits hastily abandoned major places like Zhengzhou and Kaifeng, concentrating all the troops they could muster in the Xuzhou area. But even this concentration was no use; as soon as the PLA launched its offensive, it wiped out the Huang Botao Corps of ten divisions of bandit troops. Chiang Kai-shek's bandits hastily transferred Huang Wei's Corps of 100,000 men from Henan to rescue Xuzhou, but they were also surrounded by the PLA on their way. At this time, the three corps of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits Qiu Qingquan, Li ＠, and Sun Yuanliang in Xuzhou, seeing that the situation was not good, fled south in a panic, wanting to rescue Huang Wei's Corps and then escape south together. But not far after escaping from Xuzhou, the three corps of more than 200,000 men were completely surrounded by us, and more than 30,000 of them have already been wiped out. If they don't surrender, they will be completely annihilated.
    In order to strive for the faster liberation of all of North China and the liberation of all of China, the masses in many places in North China are enthusiastically joining the People's Liberation Army. For example, more than 240 people joined the army in Huixian in one day. Cadres from five or six counties in the North Yue District, such as Fuping and Pingshan, took the lead in signing up to join the army. They are determined to participate in this most glorious battle in Chinese history!

  　包围蒋匪二十万
    徐州是南京的大门，现在这大门已被解放军占领了。当解放军大军的阵势向徐州摆开的时候，蒋匪就慌忙把郑州、开封这些大地方都丢下，把他能集中的军队都集中到徐州地区。他再集中也不行；解放军一开始进攻，就消灭了匪军黄伯韬兵团十个师。蒋匪慌忙从河南把黄维兵团十万人调来救徐州，赶到半路上也叫解放军包围住了。这时徐州的蒋匪邱清泉，李＠、孙元良三个兵团一看大势不好，就仓惶南窜，想去救下黄维兵团然后一起往南逃跑。可是逃出徐州没多远，三个兵团二十多万人也完全叫咱包围住了，已经消灭了他三万多人，如果不投降，就要完全消灭掉他。
    为了争取更快解放全华北、解放全中国，华北有不少地方的群众正热烈参加解放军，如辉县一天就有二百四十多人参军，北岳区阜平、平山等五六县的干部纷纷带头报名参军，他们决心参加这中国历史最光荣的战斗！
