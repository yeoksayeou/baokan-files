　　The Soviet state has victoriously completed the plan for the first two years of the post-war Five-Year Plan, which has accelerated our movement towards a communist society. This year, our country should achieve new leaps and bounds in all sectors of the national economy, and achieve new accomplishments in all fields of culture and science. In order to victoriously solve the enormous tasks placed before every Party organization, we must further consolidate local Party organs, further strengthen the political and organizational work of local Parties among the masses, and further enhance the role of local Parties in exercising genuine supervision over local government and economic organs, and in carrying out criticism and self-criticism.

　　To ensure that the Party's organizational work can adapt to the Party's current tasks, the most important condition is to develop intra-Party democracy and self-criticism; to ensure that Party organizations always stay ahead of the workers and mobilize the entire Soviet people to fulfill and exceed the Stalin Five-Year Plan, the Party organizations must constantly develop the initiative of Party members and continuously enhance their sense of responsibility and awareness. The essence of intra-Party democracy lies in attracting all Party members to actively participate in the Party's leadership work, participate in the formulation of resolutions, and implement resolutions in practice. Comrade Stalin taught us: "We understand that democracy means enhancing the activity and awareness of the masses within the Party, systematically attracting the masses within the Party to participate in the work, not only to participate in the discussion of issues, but also to participate in the leadership work."

　　District Party Congresses have been held in many of our provinces, and these meetings have fully and clearly demonstrated the enormous power of intra-Party democracy. These congresses were conducted as a rule on the basis of sharp criticism and self-criticism. The congresses exposed many shortcomings in local work, enabled Party organizations to solve many new tasks, and promoted all the most successful workers to leadership positions. Recently, many provinces (including Moscow and Leningrad) are also about to hold district Party congresses, and many provinces will convene provincial Party congresses in January, February and March. These meetings should become more important events in the life of the Party. The congresses should summarize the work of local Party organizations and their leading organs over a longer period of time, and should point out concrete methods suitable for local conditions to complete the current tasks of the Party and the state.

　　The provincial Party congresses will be convened in an atmosphere of high political and labor enthusiasm of the people. Our industry is victoriously completing its plans, the rural economy is becoming increasingly prosperous, and major measures such as currency reform and the abolition of ration cards for food and industrial products have been implemented. The socialist competition to complete the Five-Year Plan in four years is being carried out on an increasingly wider scale. The recent elections of local Soviets of Workers' Deputies fully demonstrated the unbreakable spiritual and political unity of the Soviet people, and fully demonstrated the people's great trust in the Bolshevik Party. However, if our Party congresses do not reveal the dangers of complacency and self-satisfaction caused by victory, and do not focus all attention on eradicating the shortcomings in our work that hinder our progress, then such Party congresses would commit an unforgivable error. The Party Congresses must be conducted on the principles of sharp criticism and self-criticism, which is the most important condition for further enhancing the combat effectiveness of Party organizations.

　　Comrade Stalin taught us: "The Party plays a leading role in all basic issues of our domestic and foreign policies. It is precisely because of this that we have achieved many victories in domestic and foreign policies. Therefore, the issue of Party building, the issue of the Party's ideological level, the issue of the Party's cadres, the issue of the Party's ability to lead in economic construction and Soviet construction, the issue of the Party's proportion in the working class and the peasantry, and finally, the issue of the Party's internal organizational situation, in short, all of these are basic issues in our policies." The end of the war and the transition of all life to a peaceful track require us to earnestly strengthen the Party's organizational work and ideological education work. At present, one of the main tasks of the Party is to improve the level of Party work, and on this basis, improve the level of Bolshevik leadership in state and economic undertakings. Naturally, the provincial Party Congresses must devote a large part of their attention to how the provincial committees lead the district committees, what methods they adopt to strengthen the lower-level Party organizations, and what kind of working methods and working styles the Party's leading organs have. At present, it should be very sharply pointed out that it is necessary to improve the ideological and professional level of Party and Soviet cadres, and to widely carry out political education work. If the internal life of the Party organizations can be tense and active, and have full and profound ideological content, if the principles of intra-Party democracy can be strictly observed, if Bolshevik criticism can be launched in a timely manner, and if Communist Party members are attracted to active Party and socio-political life, and can play a vanguard role in all posts, then Communist Party members will become more mature, more cultured, and more ideologically trained.

　　The improvement of the level of Party work is inseparable from how the Party organizations carry out ideological education, and is inseparable from the thorough and uncompromising struggle against the remnants of capitalism lurking in the Soviet people. The famous resolutions of the Central Committee of the CPSU on ideological issues are programmatic documents for all local Party organizations. However, some of our provincial committees have not made the necessary conclusions for their practical work based on these resolutions. For example, after this resolution, the ideological leadership work of the Chkalov Provincial Committee has hardly changed at all, and is still as rough and careless as in the past; it does not delve into the details of propaganda work and theatrical art work in the area, and is still as enthusiastic and obsessed with the statistical figures of the number of students, but has no interest in how teachers teach, what students learn, and what they read.

　　Strengthening Party organizational work and ideological education work is an important condition for our Party to achieve success in mobilizing the masses to implement the Party's line, enhancing the socialist awareness of the workers, and constantly cultivating the patriotic sentiments of the Soviet people. Mass work - this is the most important duty and responsibility of every Party organization. Enormous national economic tasks are placed before our Soviet state. To solve this task, it is necessary to overcome many difficulties. However, we Communists know this method that has always guaranteed our victory - that is, to directly face the masses and enhance their initiative and socialist awareness.

　　Mobilizing the masses for political work, cultivating and educating cadres, and encouraging the initiative and reform spirit of the masses in every possible way - this is not only a component of the Party's organizational work, but the fundamental basis of the Party organization's activities, and a decisive lever. With the help of this lever, we can accomplish all tasks. But unfortunately, some Party leaders still put mass political and organizational work in a secondary position. Thus, blind trust in orders, the bad style of administrative work, the separation of the leaders themselves from propaganda and mobilization work among the masses, the shortcomings in the leadership work of the Communist Youth League and trade unions, and finally, all kinds of bureaucratic attitudes towards the demands and difficulties of the workers, all arise from this. Everyone knows what a significant role socialist competition plays in our country, but there are still many facts of vulgarizing socialist competition here. This is because some of our Party leaders do not understand that competition is a mass movement that is built on the highly developed basis of the initiative and spontaneity of the broadest masses. At the District Party Congresses, some representatives even said in their speeches that the work tasks of some collective farms last year were all formulated by the higher levels, and many production teams, production groups, and collective farm members not only did not participate in the discussions, but even did not know what tasks they were responsible for. Such an attitude towards work can bring us nothing but political damage.

　　For Party leaders - first of all, for the organizers of the people, it is essential to always be in contact with the masses. The progress of the Provincial Party Congresses should take as its main purpose the resolute strengthening of mass political work in socialist competition, the enhancing of the concern of Party organs for the immediate needs of the people, and the development of the spontaneity and creative enthusiasm of the workers.

　　The mass work of the Bolshevik Party has always been aimed at mobilizing the power of the people to solve the most important economic tasks. The Party should resolutely fight against any ideas that bind the initiative of the masses in the struggle to exceed the economic plan, and that hinder us from developing the enormous potential of our organizations. The Party Committee should treat economic work with the attitude of a political leadership organ, instead of monopolizing and replacing the work of Soviet workers and economic workers; it should guide them and supervise them, instead of immersing itself in many daily affairs; it should focus its attention on dealing with the primary issues, and should show a high degree of principle and uncompromising spirit towards the shortcomings of the work. One of the most important characteristics of a mature political leader is that he is good at seeing the decisive links in many tasks, and good at constantly absorbing and utilizing new potential forces.

　　At present, the comprehensive mechanization of the labor process, the adoption of advanced technologies (especially in sectors such as construction, coal mining, and forestry) are of particular significance. And the level of Party work in the industrial sector is largely determined by the degree of victory of mechanization, the adoption of new technologies, and the degree of absorption and utilization of local resources and potentials. The Provincial Party Congresses should repeatedly check the depth of the Party Committee's research into the work of various enterprises. After the currency reform, the work of economic accounting, saving, and the correct organization of wages has been vigorously put forward, but here we must not stop at general decisions, but must earnestly understand the issue of saving, formulate correct economic work policies, and organize inspections of the extent of their implementation. Comrade Stalin once said that ignorance of business and a careless and superficial attitude towards work will cause "the Party's leadership to either degenerate into a pile of ridiculous instructions that no one needs, or degenerate into empty and verbal 'leadership' that cannot affect anyone or anything." Although Party organs have accumulated a lot of good experience in the industrial sector, we still cannot fail to see that we still have a considerable number of formalistic, armchair-based leadership attitudes, rather than an organizer's attitude towards the cause.

　　Let us take the case of the Stalingrad Provincial Committee's management of industry. More than half of the enterprises in the province (including large-scale factories) failed to complete their work plans. And the Provincial Committee confined itself to merely passing general resolutions. In the ten months of last year alone, the Provincial Committee passed six resolutions on the work of the Stalingrad Tractor Factory, but the factory still stubbornly violated the work plan. The Party did not organize the people to implement the resolutions. Some undisciplined workers paid no attention to the implementation of the resolutions, and our Provincial Party Committee did not show the necessary steadfastness and strictness in its work attitude towards this.

　　We should sweep away the shortcomings in our industrial leadership with the most resolute work attitude, and should ruthlessly eradicate those ideas that hinder our Stakhanovite movement, those ideas that hinder the excavation of new reserve forces, the adoption of advanced technologies, and the acceleration of the speed of production development. A sharp struggle should also be waged in order to further improve the level of the Party's leadership in rural economic work. Our country has achieved preliminary victories in developing the rural economy after the war, and these victories have formed the basic conditions for us to develop more rapidly forward. For this, our local Party organs need to quickly eliminate the serious shortcomings revealed in the resolutions of the Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the CPSU, and quickly end the procrastination in preparing and carrying out rural economic work. The fact that there were large differences in harvest yields in many regions last year fully illustrates the shortcomings in our leadership work. We cannot fail to see that the achievements in some regions are mainly obtained by advanced collective farms. There are still many backward regions and collective farms here, and our Provincial Committees cannot regularly go deep into every region, and cannot make all District Committees deeply permeate into the details of rural life, and take all necessary measures to strengthen our various collective farms. Our Provincial Committees cannot guarantee such leadership.

　　We have only taken the first step in improving the leadership of the rural economy, but facts of complacency and self-satisfaction are already more or less present. For example, the Bezhanitsy District completed the grain plan for the first time in several years. Some of their leaders have already firmly believed that they are now omnipotent masters who can easily handle everything. They were so intoxicated with last year's victory that they violated the tractor repair plan, relaxed their work on ensuring the timely and full supply of various seeds to the collective farms, and did not care about the work of accumulating snow and transporting fertilizer to the fields.

　　The Provincial Party Congresses will be convened before the spring plowing, so they should earnestly formulate good plans that can complete all current rural economic work. And we should prevent the mistakes that some District Party Congresses have already made. These mistakes are that the representatives focus all their attention on the current conference affairs, and greatly reduce the significance of the conference - formulating the Party's organizational line for a longer period of time.

　　A serious shortcoming in the practical work of some Party Committees is that they only carry out daily work, and neglect the basic task of organizing the economy - consolidating labor cooperatives. If the issue of labor cooperatives can be correctly resolved, it will be able to guarantee our development prospects, enable us to fully and most rationally use the productive forces of collective farms, and increase the wealth of collective farms. The interests of collective farms and the state require the economic development of such labor cooperatives to be comprehensive. Everyone is very clear that if we do not develop public livestock husbandry, we cannot consolidate collective farms. However, many Party organizations have not given due attention to this urgent and important issue for the state and the collective farms themselves. This is by no means the only example, and there are many other examples that can be used to illustrate this. In order to fully grasp the driving force for developing the agricultural economy, and in order to give full play to all the reserve forces of our collective farms, our Party organizations still need to do a lot of work. The Provincial Party Congresses should point out the specific prospects for rural economic development in the next few years. All work should be carried out in order to strive to complete the Five-Year Plan in four years in the rural economic sector.

　　The mission of the Provincial Party Congresses that are about to be convened is to play their significant role in all improvements in Party organizational work. This obliges the various Provincial Committees to ensure that the preparations for the Congresses are carefully carried out. Special attention should be paid to how to make the work reports rich in content and sharp in questions, to make a detailed analysis of the work situation, to expose the shortcomings of the work and the root causes of the shortcomings, and to stipulate the tasks for future work. Comrade Stalin instructed us: "The masses within the Party, at the meetings of activists, at the various representative meetings of the Party, review the methods of their leaders: that is, listen to their reports, look at their spirit of criticism of their own shortcomings, and finally see whether this or that leading comrade is elected to the leading organs." An atmosphere should be created at the Provincial Party Congresses so that the representatives can comprehensively discuss the work report of the Provincial Committee, and launch sharp principled criticism. The Congresses should elect strong Bolsheviks, people who are completely loyal to the great cause of Lenin and Stalin, people who have shown perseverance and clear principles in the struggle to implement the current tasks of the Party, and people who possess all the necessary qualities of a Party worker, to the Party's leading organs.

　　The convening of the Party Congresses should help improve the Party's organizational work, help improve the Party's leading role, and better mobilize the workers to carry out the struggle to complete the Five-Year Plan in four years.

　　进一步提高党的工作水准
    联共“党的生活”杂志一九四八年第二期社论
    苏维埃国家已经胜利地完成了战后五年计划的头两年计划，这就加速了我们向共产主义社会前进的运动。本年度，我国应在一切国民经济的部门里造成新的飞跃的进步。应在一切文化、科学的领域上取得新的成就。为了胜利地解决提在每个党组织面前的巨大任务，我们必须要进一步巩固地方党的机构，进一步加强地方党在群众中的政治工作和组织工作，进一步提高地方党对当地政府机关和经济机关实行真正监督与开展批评、自我批评方面的作用。
    要使党的组织工作能够适应党的当前任务，最重要的条件就是要开展党内民主和自我批评；要使各个党组织始终走在劳动者的前面，要动员全体苏维埃人民去完成和超过斯大林五年计划，党的组织就必需不断的发扬党员的积极性，不断的提高他们的责任感和自觉性。党内民主的实质就在于吸引全体党员积极参加党的领导工作，参加制订决议，并在实践中执行决议。斯大林同志教导我们说：“我们了解，民主就是提高党内群众的积极性和自觉性，有系统的吸引党内群众参加工作，不仅仅是参加讨论问题，而且还要参加到领导工作中去。”
    在我们许多省份里都曾举行过区的党代表大会，这些会议充分明确地证明了党内民主的巨大力量。这些大会照例是在尖锐的批评与自我批评的基础上进行的。大会揭露了地方工作中的很多缺点，使党的组织解决了许多新的任务，并把一切最有成绩的工作人员提升到领导机关中去。最近还有许多省份（其中有莫斯科和列宁格勒），要举行区的党代表大会，许多省份将在一二三月召开省党代表大会，这些会议在党的生活中应成为更重要的事件。大会应当作出地方党组织及其领导机关在较长时期中的工作总结，应当指出适合于各地具体情况的，完成党和国家当前任务的具体办法。
    各省的党代表大会，即将在人民高度的政治积极性和劳动积极性的情况下召开。我们的工业正在胜利的完成自己的计划，农村经济正日趋繁荣，象货币改革和废除粮食工业品的凭券购货制这种重大措施都已实现。争取五年计划四年完成的社会主义竞赛正在日益广泛的开展。不久前举行的各地劳动者代表苏维埃的选举，充分的显示了苏维埃人民的牢不可破的精神上政治上的统一，充分显示了人民对布尔什维克党的伟大信任。然而如果我们党的代表大会不揭示出因胜利而引起的心满意足和高枕无忧的危险性，不集中一切注意去根绝那些阻碍我们前进的工作缺点，那么，这种党的代表大会，就犯了不可饶恕的错误。党代大会必需在尖锐的批评和自我批评的原则下进行，这是进一步提高党组织战斗力的最重要的条件。
    斯大林同志教导我们说：“在我们内外政策的各种基本问题上，党都起了领导作用，正因如此，我们在内外政策方面才取得了很多胜利。因此，关于建党问题，关于党的思想水准问题，关于党的干部问题，关于党在经济建设和苏维埃建设工作中的领导能力问题，关于党在工人阶级和农民中的比重问题，最后，关于党的内部组织状况问题，总之，这一切都是我们政策中的基本问题。”战争的结束与一切生活之过渡到和平轨道都要求我们认真的加强党的组织工作和思想教育工作。目前党的主要工作任务之一就是提高党的工作水准，并在这个基础上提高国家和经济事业中的布尔什维克的领导水准。自然，省的党代大会必得分出大部注意力注意省委是怎样领导区委的，他们采取什么样办法去加强下级党组织，党的领导机关有着怎样的工作方法和工作作风。目前，应非常尖锐的提出：必需提高党和苏维埃干部的思想水准和业务水准，广泛展开政治教育工作。如果党组织内部的生活都能紧张活跃，都有充分深刻的思想内容，如果能严守党内民主的原则，及时展开布尔什维克的批评，如果共产党员都被吸引到积极的党的和社会政治的生活中去，并在一切岗位上都能起先锋的作用，那么，共产党员就会更成熟，更有修养，和更有思想锻炼。
    党的工作水准的提高是和党的组织怎样进行思想教育不能分开的，是和向潜伏在苏维埃人民中的资本主义残余作彻底、不妥协斗争这件事不能分开的。联共中央关于思想问题的各种著名决议就是一切地方党组织的纲领的文件，然而，我们的某些省委，却没有根据这个决议作出自己实际工作中必需的结论来。譬如：在这个决议之后，奇克洛夫省委的思想领导工作几乎根本没有改变，还是和往昔一样的粗枝大叶；根本不深入了解宣传工作以及该地戏剧艺术等工作的详细情况，还是和往昔一样，那么热中和醉心于学习人数的统计数字，而对于教员如何教，学生学些什么，念些什么，他们却毫无兴趣。
    加强党内组织工作和思想教育工作，是我党在动员群众执行党的路线，提高劳动者社会主义自觉性和不断培养苏维埃爱国主义情绪方面达到成功的重要条件。群众工作——这是每个党组织的最重要的本分和天职。巨大的国民经济任务摆在我们苏维埃国家面前，为要解决这个任务必需克服许多困难。然而，我们共产党知道这个历来保证我们胜利的方法——就是要直接面向着群众，提高群众的积极性和社会主义的自觉性。
    动员群众的政治工作，培养教育干部的工作，用一切办法来鼓励群众的自动性和改革精神——这不单是党的组织工作的组成部分之一，而是党组织活动的根本基础，是有决定意义的杠杆，借助于这个杠杆，我们可以完成一切工作。但是可惜得很，某些党的领导者，还把群众政治和组织工作放在次要的地位。于是对命令的盲目信任，行政工作的不良作风，领导者本身脱离群众的宣传鼓动工作，共产主义青年团和职工会领导工作中的缺点，最后，对待劳动者的要求和困难所表现各种各样的官僚主义态度，便都由此产生了。大家都知道，社会主义竞赛在我们国家是起了怎样重大的推动作用，可是我们这里还有很多把社会主义竞赛庸俗化的事实，这是由于我们的某些党的领导者，不了解竞赛是一种群众运动，它是建筑在最广大群众的积极性和自动性高度发展的基础之上的。这次在区的党代表大会上，有些代表在发言中甚至说道：去年某些集体农庄的工作任务都是上级制订的，许多生产队、生产小组和农庄庄员不仅没有参加讨论，甚至他们对自己所负担的任务都不知道。这样的工作态度，除了带给我们政治损害以外是不能带给我们任何东西的。
    对于党的领导者——首先是对于人民的组织者，经常与群众结合乃是必不可少的。省党代表大会的进行，应当以坚决加强社会主义竞赛中的群众政治工作，以提高党的机关对人民切身需要的关心以发展劳动者的自动性和创造的积极性为其主要目的。
    布尔什维克党的群众工作，任何时都是以动员人民力量去解决最重要的经济任务为目的的，凡是束缚群众在争取超过经济计划中的自动性，凡是妨碍我们发挥我们组织的巨大潜在力的思想，党都应该对他进行坚决的斗争。党委会应以政治领导机关的工作态度对待经济工作，而不是包办代替苏维埃工作者和经济工作者；是指导他们，监督他们，而不是把自己沉溺在很多日常事务里；是集中注意去对待首要问题，应当表现出对工作缺点的高度原则性和不妥协的精神。一个成熟的政治领导的最重要的特征之一，就在于它善于看到许多工作中有决定意义的环节，和善于不断吸取与利用新的潜在力量。
    目前劳动过程的全面机械化，先进技术的采用（尤其是在建筑业、采煤业和林业等部门内）都具有特殊重大的意义。而工业部门内党的工作水平之高低在很大程度上是以机械化胜利的程度、新技术的采用、及吸取利用地方资源和潜力的程度来判定的。省的党代表大会应当反复检查党委会对各种企业工作研究的深入程度。在币制改革之后，经济核算、节约，和工资的正确组织等工作便被强有力的提出来了，但在这里决不能止于一般的决定，而是要认真的了解节约问题，作出正确的经济工作方针，并对其执行程度组织检查。斯大林同志曾说过，对业务的无知，粗心浮气的工作态度，都会使“党的领导或者是堕落成任何人都不需要的一堆可笑的指令，或者是堕落到任何人任何事务都不能影响的空洞和口头上的‘领导’中去”。虽然，党的机关已经积累了很多很好工业部门中的经验，但是，我们仍不能不看到，我们还有相当多的形式主义的纸上谈兵的领导态度，而不是一个组织者对待事业的态度。
    我们试举斯大林格勒省委管理工业的情形来说吧，该省有半数以上的企业部门（其中包括规模宏大的工厂）没有完成工作计划。而省委会竟把自己局限于仅仅通过一般性决议案的工作上。仅在去年十个月的期间内，省委就通过了六个关于斯大林格勒拖拉机工厂工作的决议，但工厂仍是一成不变的破坏着工作计划，党没有组织人民去执行决议，某些目无纪律的工作者对于决议的执行毫不注意，而我们的省党委对此也没有表现出必要的坚强不移和严格不苟的工作态度。
    我们应当以最坚决的工作态度来扫除我们在工业领导中的缺点，应当无情的根绝那些阻挠我们的斯达哈诺夫运动的思想，那些妨碍掘发新的后备力量，采用先进技术以及加速生产发展速度的思想。为了进一步提高党对农村经济工作中领导的水准，也应当进行尖锐的斗争。在战后发展农村经济方面，我国已取得了初步的胜利，这些胜利形成了我们更迅速地向前发展的基本条件。为此，就需要我们地方党的机关迅速清除联共中央二月全会决议中所揭露出的那些严重缺点，迅速结束那此在准备和进行农村经济工作上的拖延现象。去年在收获量方面许多地区有很大差别，这件事充分说明了我们领导工作中的缺点。我们不能不看到某些地区的工作成绩主要是靠先进的集体农庄而获得的。我们这里还有不少的落后的地区和集体农庄，我们的省委会，还不能经常深入到每一个地区去，还不能使全部区委都深刻地渗入到农村生活的细节中去，以及采取一切必需的办法来加强我们的各个集体农庄。我们的省委会还不能保证这样的领导。
    在改善农村经济领导工作上，我们还仅仅作了第一步，但是，心满意足和高枕无忧的事实却已经要多少有多少了。例如：别疆斯克省几年来才第一次的完成了粮食计划，他们的某些领导者就已经确定的认为：现在他们已是把一切事情都能轻易办好的万能之师了，他们那样的沉醉于去年的胜利里，以致于破坏了拖拉机的修理计划，放松了对集体庄及时充分保证各种种籽的工作，和没有关心往田地里积雪和肥料转运的工作。
    省的党代大会，将在春耕以前召集，所以他们应当认真制订很好的能于完成当前一切农村经济工作的计划。并应预防某些区的党代大会所已犯的错误，这些错误就是代表们把一切注意力都集中于当时的会务问题，而把大会的意义——制定较长期间的党的组织路线这一点，大大的降低了。
    某些党委会在实际工作中的严重缺点是他们只进行日常工作，而忽略了组织经济的基本任务——巩固劳动合作社。如果劳动合作社问题能够正确解决，那就能够保证我们的发展前途，使我们有可能充分地、最合理地使用集体农庄的生产力，和增加集体农庄的财富。集体农庄和国家的利益要求这种劳动合作社的经济，得到全面的发展。大家都很清楚，如果我们不发展公共牲畜业，就不能巩固集体农庄，然而很多党的组织，对于这个对国家和集体农庄本身迫切、重要的问题，还没有给以应有的主意，这绝不是唯一的例子，此外还有很多例子可以说明。为了充分的掌握发展农业经济的动力，为了发挥我们集体农庄的一切后备力量，我们党的组织还须要做很多很多的工作。省党代表大会应当指出几年后农村经济发展的具体前途。应当进行一切工作，以便争取农村经济部门中的五年计划之四年完成。
    行将召开的省党代表大会的使命，就是要在一切改善党的组织工作中起其重大作用，这就责成各个省委保证仔细的进行大会的准备工作，要特别注意怎样使工作报告内容丰富和问题尖锐，要作出详细工作情况的分析，揭露工作缺点和产生缺点的根源，并规定今后的工作任务。斯大林同志曾指示我们说：“党内群众，在积极分子会上，在党的各种代表会上，审查自己领导者的方法：就是听取他们的报告，看他们对自己缺点的批评精神，最后看这个或那个领导同志，是否被选举到领导机关中去。”在省党代表会上应当造成一种空气，使代表们能够全面讨论省委的工作报告，和展开尖锐的原则的批评。大会应当把坚强的布尔什维克们，把完全忠实于列宁、斯大林伟大事业的人，把在执行党的当前任务的斗争里表现了坚忍不拔和有明确原则的人员，把兼有党的工作者的一切必备品质的人员，选举到党的领导机关中去。
    党代表大会的召开，应帮助提高党的组织工作，帮助提高党的领导作用，和更好地动员劳动者去进行争取五年计划四年完成的斗争。
