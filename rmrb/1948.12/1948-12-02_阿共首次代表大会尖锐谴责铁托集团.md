Enver Hoxha, General Secretary of the Albanian Communist Party, delivered a report on the 9th and 10th, emphasizing that the Albanian people are united with the peace and democracy camp led by the Soviet Union, and sharply condemned the Tito group's nationalist policies. The congress has now adopted the party constitution and passed a new name for the party: "Albanian Workers' Party."
