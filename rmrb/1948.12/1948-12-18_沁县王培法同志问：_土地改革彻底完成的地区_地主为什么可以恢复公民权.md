　　Comrade Wang Peifa of Qin County Asks:
　　Landlords should be able to have their civil rights restored in areas where land reform has been thoroughly completed.
　　Comrade Wang Peifa of Qin County has raised two questions in his studies, which are worthy of our joint research and discussion. They involve many fundamental issues of understanding. If we can clarify them in "Learning and Discussion," it will help comrades in various places further distinguish ideological boundaries and find basic methods for understanding issues. Our newspaper has conducted internal discussions, and now we excerpt two articles to elicit opinions.

Editor:
　　In our study of the preface to the second chapter of "Left-Wing" Communism: An Infantile Disorder, everyone raised two questions. Although the comrades have discussed them, we still feel that they have not been thoroughly resolved. We are writing them below for your reply:
　　(1) The issue of restoring civil rights to landlords. When everyone mentioned the people's democratic dictatorship, they unanimously agreed that it was a question of the nature of the new democratic regime, the dictatorship of the masses of the people over imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. According to Chairman Mao's interpretation at the meeting of cadres in Jin Sui, this so-called "masses of the people" does not include landlords and rich peasants. At the same time, we believe this to be the case as they are currently the enemies of the revolution in China at this stage. Doesn't the general line state this more clearly? The revolution of the masses of the people led by the proletariat against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, naturally excludes the revolutionary objects, which are the masses of the people. However, restoring civil rights to landlords and rich peasants today, does this not allow them to participate in the regime? Because if civil rights are restored, there will be the right to vote and stand for election, and therefore it is possible to be elected into the regime. Does this not contradict the people's democratic dictatorship?
　　(2) Regarding the three conditions for ensuring the Party's iron discipline mentioned in the preface, are they not already fully met? However, everyone has raised several specific questions that seem inconsistent with what is said in the text, especially the third condition, which relies on the correctness of the Party's political leadership and the masses' own experience in believing in this correctness. Some issues are not appropriate such as the burden issue. According to Comrade Bo Yibo's report on administrative guidelines, the people's burden should not be increased, and it was stated that the agricultural burden should not exceed 25 percent. However, this year's burden has been strengthened, with each dan of grain having to bear 25 jin of rice. Some cadres below have reflected that "We are telling the masses that their lives will be improved in the future and their burden will be reduced, so everyone can focus on production." But with the recent increase in burden the masses no longer believe what we say. At the same time, due to the changes in our policies in recent years, not only have the masses become suspicious, but even our general cadres have become tied up, afraid of taking responsibility, and afraid of making mistakes, so that they also have doubts about the policies of the higher authorities, unable to grasp the bottom line. Of course, in general, there is no problem in saying that the Communist Party is good, the Kuomintang is bad, the Eighth Route Army will win, Jiang's army will be defeated, and that Chairman Mao's ideas are right and good, and the ideas from above are right and good, but the peasants often look at some practical issues, like the example of the burden mentioned above, which cannot be explained to the masses.
　　We eagerly await your instruction on whether the above issues are correct or not.

### 沁县王培法同志问：  土地改革彻底完成的地区　地主为什么可以恢复公民权

专栏：学习讨论

　　沁县王培法同志问：
    土地改革彻底完成的地区
  　地主为什么可以恢复公民权
    沁县王培法同志在学习中提出了两个问题，颇值得我们大家来共同研究展开讨论。其中涉及到许多根本认识问题，如果能够在“学习讨论”中把它弄清楚了，将会帮助各地同志进一步分清思想界限找到认识问题的基本方法，我们报社内部先作了讨论，现摘录两篇，抛砖引玉，请大家发表意见。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　——编者编辑同志：
    我们在学习左派幼稚病第二章前言中，大家提出了两个问题，虽经同志们讨论，但仍觉得解决的不彻底。兹写在下面请答复一下：
    （一）恢复地主公民权的问题。当大家提到人民民主专政时一致认为是新民主主义的政权性质问题。是人民大众向帝国主义封建主义和官僚资本的专政，这个所谓人民大众，按毛主席在晋绥干部会议上的解释，并不包括地主富农，同时我们认为也是这样子。因为他是我们目前中国现阶段的革命敌人，总路线不是说的更明显吗？无产阶级领导的人民大众的反帝国主义、封建主义及官僚资本主义的革命，那当然是除了人民大众之外的，就是革命对象。但今天恢复地、富公民权，这不是让他参加政权吗？因为既要恢复公民权，那就有选举和被选举权，因此就可能被选入政权里边。这样不是和人民民主专政相抵触的吗？
    （二）关于前言中所说保证党的铁的纪律的三个条件不是已经充分具备了吗？但大家提出这样几个具体问题觉得和文中所说不甚一致，特别是第三个条件是靠党的政治领导的正确。并且是群众自身经验相信此种正确。这一点，有些问题就不合适。如负担问题吧，按薄一波同志的施政方针报告上说是不加重人民负担，并说明农业负担不超过百分之二十五，可是今年的负担恰恰是加强了，每担谷要负担二十五斤米。下边有些干部反映说：“我们在下边给群众宣传今后人民生活要得到改善，负担要减轻，大家都安心生产吧”。可是这样一来，群众就不相信我们说的了。同时，又由于近年来我们政策的变动，不但使群众发生怀疑，就是我们一般干部同样也因此束手束脚，怕负责任，怕犯错误，以致对上级的政策也或多或少有所怀疑，摸不住底。当然大的方面说，共产党好，国民党坏，八路军胜利，蒋军必败，以致于说毛主席的主张对、好，上边的主张对、好，都没有什么问题，但农民却往往要从一些实际问题上去看，就象上边负担的例子就无法给群众解释。
    上述问题对否翘盼示教　　　　致以敬礼
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　沁县　王培法　　十一月十三日
