Xinhua News Agency, East China, 9th: The Lu Zhongnan District, south of the Jiaoji Railway in Shandong, has resolved the contradiction between farmers supporting the front lines and maintaining rear production by adopting a method of exchanging "front support labor" and "production labor" at equal value. Due to the implementation of this method of exchanging labor between the front and rear, the district basically completed the two major tasks of supporting the war to liberate Jinan and autumn plowing and sowing in the district during the months of September and October. According to incomplete statistics, in September, the district mobilized more than 260,000 people for stretchers and transportation to support the Jinan front (calculating each person per day as one labor unit, totaling approximately 5.5 million labor units), and also pre-collected more than 80 million catties of autumn public grain to ensure military food supplies. At the same time, thanks to the joint efforts of men, women, old, and young in the rear, autumn plowing and sowing were also largely completed. With these two major tasks of supporting the front and maintaining production being carried out simultaneously, the morale of cadres was high, and the farmers were very satisfied, saying, "Last year, supporting the front delayed production, but this year, supporting the front has promoted production."

The so-called method of exchanging labor between the front and rear stipulates that the labor provided by the people to support the front and the labor provided to help the families of front support laborers with production should both be recorded in labor accounts, and the two types of labor can be offset against each other. Before this method was implemented, front support laborers were assigned by the self-defense corps on a rotating basis, and helping the families of front support laborers with production was the responsibility of labor exchange groups. Because helping the families of front support laborers with production was an unpaid obligation that could not offset front support labor, those helping were not motivated to work well, which affected the morale of the front support laborers. Furthermore, because front support labor could not offset production labor, front support laborers could not help but worry about production at home while on duty. Moreover, assigning the task of helping front support laborer families with production to labor exchange groups meant that those who did not participate in the labor exchange groups benefited, hindering the future organization of labor exchange groups. In the past, supporting the front was unorganized, and rear production was also unorganized. For every ten laborers sent to the front, at least ten more had to be allocated to help the families of those laborers with production. Therefore, in addition to the fact that those helping in the rear did not work diligently and those serving at the front were not at ease, there was also the disadvantage of increasing the war burden on the people by allocating more labor. Now, with the implementation of the method of exchanging front support labor and production labor at equal value, helping the families of front support laborers with production can offset front support labor, which is not unpaid. Those helping will then work diligently, and the laborers at the front will know that someone at home is working diligently for them, so they do not need to worry before and after departure and can work at ease at the front. In this way, both the work at the front and the production in the rear are guaranteed. Moreover, the implementation of this method can greatly increase the enthusiasm of farmers for production. For example, if a farmer earns ten labor units by supporting the front, but his family needs five labor units of help with production, exchanging them at equal value means that the five production labor units provided by others offset five front support labor units, and in reality, he has only earned five front support labor units himself. Therefore, he will actively engage in production before departure, or urge the women in his family to engage in production, to avoid others helping and offsetting his labor units. Those who have not been assigned to work will try to help the families of front support laborers more to offset some of their own front support labor units next time. As a result, supporting the front not only does not delay production but also promotes it.

The adoption of this method also requires simultaneously persuading cadres to understand that supporting the front and production are equally important, and that both tasks must be completed. After the task of supporting the front was assigned by the higher authorities, the general cadres in the Lu Zhongnan District developed the idea of "emphasizing support for the front and neglecting production," believing that the task of supporting the front had a specific number set by the higher authorities, and that they would be criticized if it was not completed, while production would be carried out by the farmers themselves, and that it would not matter if they relaxed a little. Some cadres even dared not promote production to farmers for fear of affecting support for the front. In response to this situation, the Lu Zhongnan District Party Committee issued instructions on September 1st, pointing out that supporting the front, autumn harvesting, autumn plowing, and autumn sowing were the urgent central tasks of Lu Zhongnan at that time, and that both must be carried out simultaneously. On the one hand, if the work of supporting the front is not done well, it will affect the victory of the war; on the other hand, if autumn harvesting, autumn plowing, and autumn sowing are not done well, it will not be possible to effectively support the war, and it will also lead to famine next year. These instructions initially made the cadres clearly understand the relationship between the two central tasks of supporting the front and production, so that they would not place too much emphasis on one side when deploying work.

Persuading the cadres and implementing the method of exchanging labor between the front and rear were the keys to the Lu Zhongnan District completing the two tense tasks of the front and rear. Many counties and districts in the Lu Zhongnan District seized the time to launch a concentrated effort to harvest and plow in the autumn before the Jinan Campaign, while also reorganizing the front support organizations. As soon as the Jinan Campaign began, they completed the first batch of front support tasks and led the autumn harvest and autumn plowing at the same time. After the first batch of tasks was completed, they shifted to focusing on leading the autumn harvest, autumn plowing, and autumn sowing, while preparing for the next batch of front support tasks. After the Jinan Campaign ended in victory, they immediately devoted all their efforts to leading the autumn sowing. As a result, both supporting the front and maintaining rear production were done very well.

Implementing the exchange of labor between the front and rear is not difficult. According to the experience of various places in Shandong, the government can issue unified labor vouchers for front support and production to calculate labor accounts. The families of front support laborers can periodically receive "front support labor vouchers" from the village government and use these vouchers to find someone to help with production themselves. Or, before departure, the front support laborers can report how much help their families need with production, and the production quota can be discussed and completed jointly by their class or group, with the labor vouchers being distributed by everyone. When implementing this method in villages that have not established labor exchange groups shortly after liberation, a democratic method can be adopted to assess how much labor the families of front support laborers need for their land, and the matter can be resolved through contracting.

### 鲁中南实行前后方等价变工  创支前推动生产范例

    鲁中南实行前后方等价变工
    创支前推动生产范例
    【新华社华东九日电】山东胶济路南的鲁中南区，采用“支前工”与“生产工”等价交换的办法，解决了农民的支援前线和后方生产的矛盾。由于实行这种前后方变工的办法，该区在九、十两个月中，基本上完成了所负担的支援解放济南的战争和本区的秋耕秋种两大任务。据不完全统计，该区九月份为支援济南前线，动用于担架和运输的民力达二十六万余人（以每人每日作为一工计算，约折合五百五十万余工），还预征了八千余万斤秋季公粮以保证军食。在同一时间，由于在后方的男女老幼的共同努力，秋耕秋种又已大体完成。在支援前线与生产这两大任务同时进行中，干部情绪都很高，农民也都很满意，说：“去年支前耽误了生产，今年支前推动了生产。”
    所谓前后方变工的办法，规定人民为支援前线所出的工和为帮助支前民工的家属生产所出的工都要记工帐，两种工可以相抵。在没有实行这个办法之前，支援前线的民工由自卫团轮流担任，帮助民工家属生产由变工组担任。因为帮助民工家属生产是毫无代价的义务，不能顶支前工，帮工的人便不好好做活，影响民工在出支前工时不安心。又因为支前工不能顶生产工，民工在出工时不能不顾虑家中生产。而且把给民工家属帮助生产作为变工组任务，不参加变工组的反而占了便宜，妨碍了以后组织变工组的工作。再前些时的办法，则是支援前线既无组织，后方生产也无组织。出十个民工到前线，起码又得拨十个人帮助民工家属生产。因此，除了在后方帮工的人不尽心生产，在前方服勤的人也不安心工作之外，还加上一个多拨工加重人民战勤负担的缺点。现在实行支前工与生产工等价交换的办法，帮助民工家属生产可以顶支前工，不是白做，帮工的人便会认真生产，到前线的民工知道有人在家给他认真生产，出发前和出发后都不用顾虑，可以安心在前方工作。这样，前线的工作和后方的生产都有了保证，不仅如此，实行这个办法，还可以大大提高农民生产的积极性。譬如一个农民，如果支前赚十个工，但家中生产需别人帮五个工，等价交换，这别人的五个生产工顶了五个支前工，实际他自己只算赚了五个支前工。所以他便会在出发前积极生产，或督促家中妇女生产，以免别人帮工顶了工去。没有出工的人，则会设法多帮民工家属做工，好顶些下次自己的支前工。结果，支援前线就不仅不耽误生产，而且还推动了生产。
    采用这个办法，还须同时打通干部思想，使干部认识到支援前线与生产同等重要，这两个任务同样必须完成。鲁中南区的一般干部，在支援前线的任务由上级分配下来后，曾产生“重支前、轻生产”的思想，以为支前任务因上级有数目字限制，完不成会受批评，生产则农民自己会进行，放松一点也不要紧。甚至有些干部因为怕影响支援前线，不敢向农民宣传生产，针对这种情况，该区中共党委曾于九月一日发出指示，指出支援前线与秋收秋耕秋种是鲁中南当时的紧急中心任务，两者必须同时进行。一方面，支前工作做不好，便会影响战争的胜利；另一方面秋收秋耕秋种做不好，便不能有效地支援战争，而且还会招致明年的灾荒。这一指示开始使干部明确认识了支前与生产两大中心任务的关系，使其在布置工作时不致偏重一方。
    打通了干部的思想，实行了前后方变工的办法，这就是鲁中南区完成了前后方两重紧张任务的关键。鲁中南区的许多县区，在济南战役前抓紧突击秋收秋耕，同时整理支前组织。济南战役一开始，就搞好了第一批支前任务，同时领导秋收秋耕。第一批任务完成后，又转而以领导秋收秋耕秋种为主，同时准备了下一批支前任务。在济南战役胜利结束后，即全力领导秋种。结果支援前线和后方生产都搞得很好。
    实行前后方变工并不困难。据山东各地经验，政府可制发支前生产统一的工票来计算工帐。民工家属可以按期向村政府领“支前工票”，并以此种工票自行找人帮助生产。或由民工在出发前自报家属需多少帮工，由自己所属的班或组共同议定并负责完成，工票由大家分。在解放不久没有变工组的村实行这个办法时，可采民主方法评定民工家属土地需工若干，用包工办法解决。
