　　Preliminary Summary of the Production Increase Competition Campaign in Shijiazhuang Public Enterprises Over the Past Half Month
　　中共石家庄市委工厂工作委员会 (The Factory Work Committee of the Shijiazhuang Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party)
　　(1) The Municipal Party Committee Issues a Call for a Competition Campaign

　　(1) In view of the fact that the employees of various public enterprises have shown a generally higher level of labor enthusiasm and production efficiency than before in the recovery work after the war preparation, and have generally completed the resumption of work plans ahead of schedule, especially the railway factories averaging 24 hours to complete two weeks of resumption tasks, the telephone bureau quickly restored automatic telephones, and the electric light company's first power plant completed ten days of resumption plan in two days and nights. The Municipal Party Committee issued a call on November 20 to launch a production increase and loss compensation competition campaign in all public enterprises in the city. After in-depth mobilization and ideological preparation among employees in the factories by the administration, the Party, and the trade union, combined with the spontaneous enthusiasm of the workers, a campaign of setting plans and challenging competitions was launched. Some units, combined with the summary meeting of war preparation and recovery, implemented rewards and punishments, organized challenges, and under the leadership of the competition committee or the factory management committee, launched a mass, conscious, and voluntary competition campaign. From the current situation, Yumin Industrial Company, Railway Factory, Transportation Office, Political Department Printing Factory, North China Industrial Company, Telephone Bureau, Brewery, Water Company and other units have carried out the movement very well, and production has been significantly improved, with many new inventions and creations and new working methods. In other a few units, although the production enthusiasm of employees is also very high, due to the lack of understanding of this new working method by the leadership and the lack of organized leadership, the movement has not been fully carried out. After the inspection by the Municipal Party Committee, they have begun to pay attention to strengthening organizational leadership, and the competition is underway.
　　(2) Significant Achievements in the Competition Campaign
　　In the competition campaign, each factory, according to its own specific conditions, some achieved the purpose of compensating for losses by increasing production and improving quality, while others compensated for war preparation losses and laid the foundation for future production development by improving business management, improving technology, saving raw materials, and reducing costs. The significant achievements of various factories in the production increase competition campaign from November 25 to December 10 are listed below:
　　Yumin Industrial Company focused on the Second Flour Mill to promote the development of the movement. The Party, government, and trade union closely combined, deeply led, and combined with timely resolution of employee welfare to carry out recreational activities. Non-production departments such as the supply and marketing section acted as a strong coordination to achieve more sales and more production. The original daily output of the Second Flour Mill was 370 bags at most. The competition started with a plan to increase it to 450 bags, but now it has actually reached 550 bags, and it will help the First Flour Mill to produce 2,000 bags of flour, strengthening the unity between the two factories. The daily cotton output of each machine in the ice factory increased from 500 to 700 catties. In the weaving factory, each worker could only weave 35 or 6 yards of foreign cloth with a motor, but now it has increased to 42 yards. Some have broken through 50 yards. Worker Zhao Xiaoxi created the highest record, reaching 57 yards. Liu Zhi of the fitter department of Yuhua Iron Factory carefully studied and improved technology, increasing from less than 180 gear wheels milled per day to 444. After the paper mill solved the problem of replacing hemp rope heads with broken sacks, the raw materials were sufficient, the cost was reduced, and the output increased from 350 sheets per pool per person per day to 550 sheets. The ice factory originally planned to make 500 pounds of ammonia in ten days, but it was completed in four days, and the quality was greatly improved. The glass factory invented a tool modified with a self-inflating tube to replace mouth blowing, and the output increased sharply to three to four times. The blown bottles were fast and uniform, and the loss of finished products was reduced (originally 20 out of 100 were bad, now reduced to 10).
　　The railway factory had the experience of the anti-sabotage competition and the foundation for recovery. In this competition, the original two-month production plan was to renovate a total of 76 passenger and freight cars in the vehicle workshop, and the goal was to complete it in one and a half months. As a result, it was completed in one month and one day ahead of schedule. The renovation workshop originally planned to repair 12 locomotives in one and a half months, and now nine have left the factory. The employees' enthusiasm is exceptionally high, and activists have organized shock teams to help others after completing their own tasks. In the competition to inspect finished products, the traditional contradiction between inspectors and workers was eliminated, and the unity of employees was strengthened.
　　Although the Da Xing Yarn Factory's movement has not been fully launched, individual departments have also launched mass production increase competitions, and efficiency has been greatly improved. The security department originally took seven days to install a part of the spinning machine, but after liberation, it took five days to assemble one, and recently it can be completed in two and a half days. In the past, only one could be wrapped in a day shift, but during this competition, two and a half could be wrapped in one day during the most intense time.
　　The telephone bureau completed three months of the plan in ten days, repairing 1,000 automatic telephones. During the shock, employees worked an average of 14 hours a day, and some reached 17 hours. They also organized line workers to participate in the work of the mechanical room, learned technology, and broke the conservative ideas of technicians. Now, in order to strengthen the construction plan of municipal public utilities, another 300 automatic telephones are being installed, and 180 public telephones are planned to be set up in Qiaodong, which greatly increases income. It is estimated that the losses in war preparation can be completely compensated within two months.
　　The Northern Printing Bureau launched a competition on the basis of the successful completion of three months of Party rectification and study. At the beginning of the movement, the leadership proposed to increase production under the conditions of maintaining employee health, not reducing quality, not damaging machines, and not wasting raw materials. The Party, government, and trade union closely combined, the leadership was organized and planned, and the employees were enthusiastic and added voluntary labor, and automatically requested to implement the big holiday system. The workers said: "As long as we do it voluntarily, we won't get sick." Non-production personnel also cooperated, such as the chef comrades who proposed to improve food and change the variety of meals. Eight and a half skilled workers were organized as foremen and have been successful. The letterpress stock of Factory 1 averaged 8,500 prints per day, which is more than 32% higher than usual, and the words are clear. Factory 2 averaged an increase of 25%. The typesetting stock typeset four pages a day, increasing efficiency by 67.4%. The one-month plan was completed in ten days.
　　The leather factory of Zhenhua Industrial Company produced 10,000 feet of wheel belts in one month before the war preparation. In the competition, it produced 5,000 feet in ten days. The cigarette factory increased from an average of 452 strips per day to 624 strips. Chen Yushan, a technician at the leather factory, invented a drying machine after two nights without sleep. Zhang Wenzeng, a technician at the cigarette factory, invented a new cigarette cutting machine.
　　The cigarette factory of North China Industrial Company increased production by 25% compared to the past. The leather factory saved 42% of the time for production. The joint factory increased output by 47.9%. The use of warm walls instead of heating equipment saved a lot of expenses.
　　Other units also showed good results in saving raw materials and reducing costs. For example, the focus of the water company was to save electricity costs, use waste materials, and reduce office expenses, which can make up for losses in two or three months. In the past, the winery needed three catties of red sorghum and one and a half catties of coal per catty of wine. Now, three of the five factories have reduced it to only two catties and twelve taels of red sorghum and one catty and four taels of coal per catty, and they are studying ways to use more bran and less grain to greatly reduce costs.
　　Of course, there are still some shortcomings in certain units that need to be improved urgently, such as the bias of emphasizing quantity over quality. Two of the four original cars of iron sand in Yuhua Iron Factory were broken. The Yumin soap factory originally produced 40 boxes a day, and then suddenly increased to 140 boxes. Recent inspections have found that 500 boxes are of poor quality. Some units have unrealistic plans, and some employees have a tendency towards trophyism. The above have all been pointed out and are being improved.
　　(3) Several Experiences in the Competition Campaign
　　1. The foundation for creating a mass, conscious, and voluntary production increase competition campaign is, on the one hand, the development of the revolutionary situation, which has crushed the enemy's sneak attack conspiracy. The employees were very enthusiastic when they saw the machines being transported back. Furthermore, we have had more than a year of work, and the employees have a preliminary understanding, especially after experiencing war preparation, they have further recognized the Party and enthusiastically supported the Party. The various units have implemented rewards and punishments based on the performance of war preparation and recovery, which has stimulated the production enthusiasm of employees and strengthened labor discipline. In addition, a group of new Party members has been developed, and a large number of activists have been cultivated. All of this has prepared better conditions for this production increase competition campaign and laid the foundation for improving production.
　　2. The leadership promptly seized the above conditions, promoted the deployment of large railway factories to compensate for war losses to become a city-wide production increase and loss compensation competition campaign, and immediately received a warm response from employees. Similarly, in factories, the movement has developed well and achieved significant results in units that have seized the enthusiasm of employees and conducted practical and timely organizational leadership. Those who lag behind the enthusiasm of the masses or only satisfy general calls and administrative deployments without specific instructors and organizing the enthusiasm of the masses cannot carry out the movement well. The further promotion of the current competition campaign is also a matter of how to strengthen leadership and organizational work to combine leadership with the enthusiastic emotions of the masses.
　　3. The competition campaign is a conscious movement of the masses and must mobilize the masses. The organization leading the movement should absorb employee representatives, engineers, and technicians to participate, listen to opinions, and let go of cadres at all levels to dare to take responsibility, and promote production through their unity of activists. Carry out democratic discussions among workers, follow the mass line to set plans and think of ways, so that the production increase plan comes from the masses and then goes to the masses. The production plan has the enthusiastic support of the masses, which guarantees its successful completion. At the same time, as long as the masses are mobilized, the great creative ability and genius wisdom of the working class can be demonstrated.
　　4. In the climax of the movement, improve all work in the factory. Labor discipline and various systems must be established, which is necessary for scientific management of production. However, it must be combined with the enthusiasm and consciousness of mobilizing the masses. Simply emphasizing administrative management cannot completely solve the problem. Organizing production competitions is a new working method for leading revolutionary employee production, which capitalists cannot do. Moreover, the labor discipline and management system of many of our units have been resolved in the movement through the voluntary methods of employees. If we cannot seize the establishment of the system, transform work, strengthen employee unity, and improve relations in all aspects in the movement, the results of the movement will be reduced.
　　5. The three aspects of administration, Party branch, and trade union in the factory must be closely combined, the leadership must be unified, and the opinions must be consistent. In this way, the administrative enterprise management and production plan will receive strong support from the Party and the trade union. At the same time, strengthening the leadership of the movement can also strengthen and enrich the work content of the branch and trade union in the movement, improve the uncoordinated phenomenon in the relationship between the Party, government, and trade union, and make our work in all aspects move forward and improve a step. We must be good at combining the competition campaign with Party building and cadre training. Timely absorb model and active figures who perform well in the movement into the Party, and boldly promote outstanding employee cadres to manage the factory.
　　6. Increasing production must be closely combined with the immediate interests of employees in order to consolidate and sustain the high production enthusiasm of employees. We must grasp the principle of taking into account both public and private interests. When the public increases production, workers can increase income, and material rewards are necessary. At the same time, we must promptly resolve workers' welfare issues and quickly implement wage adjustment plans and year-end salary increases and upgrades. Employees' obligation to process and increase working hours is certainly a manifestation of class consciousness, but we should patiently persuade workers, pay attention to physical health, and pay overtime pay. In addition, in the tense competition, there should be cultural and recreational work to coordinate, regulate the spirit, and recover fatigue.
　　7. We must promptly commend and reward heroes, models, and inventions and creations, and promote the new heroism of the masses. However, we must combine individual models with collective models. If only individual models are rewarded, they will often be isolated and detached from the masses. Some individual models and inventors should be commended, rewarded, and called upon to learn from them. The winners should then turn around to help the backward and lead everyone to strengthen unity and mutual assistance and complete production tasks.
　　8. In the production competition, quantity and quality should be placed in equally important positions. In the movement, there is often a problem of pursuing quantity and not paying attention to quality in order to complete the task. This must be solved by improving and improving technology and establishing systems such as finished product registration and inspection.

　　半月来石家庄市公营企业
  　增产竞赛运动初步总结
    中共石家庄市委工厂工作委员会
    （一）市委提出竞赛运动的号召
    （一）鉴于各公营企业职工在备战过后的复原工作中，表现了较前普遍高涨的劳动热情与生产效率，普遍地提前完成复工计划，特别是铁路工厂各所平均二十四小时完成两礼拜的复工任务，电话局迅速恢复自动电话，以及电灯公司第一发电厂两昼夜完成十天复工计划等惊人成绩，市委于十一月二十日提出了全市公营企业开展增产补损竞赛运动的号召。经过了工厂中行政、党与职工会在职工中深入的动员与思想酝酿，结合着工人自发性的热情，开展了订计划、挑战竞赛。有的单位则结合备战复原总结大会，实行奖惩，组织挑战，在竞赛委员会或工厂管理委员会的领导下，开展了群众性自觉自愿的竞赛运动。从目前情形来看，裕民实业公司、铁路工厂、运输处、政治部印刷厂、华北实业公司、电话局、酿酒厂、自来水公司等单位，运动开展得很好，生产量获得显著提高，并有着不少新的发明创造与新的工作方法。其他少数单位，职工生产情绪虽也很高涨，但由于领导上对这一新的工作方法认识不足和没有进行有组织的领导，所以运动还没有全面的开展起来，经过市委的检查后，已开始注意加强组织领导，竞赛正在开展中。
  　（二）竞赛运动中的显著成绩
    在竞赛运动中各厂根据了本身的具体条件，有的从增加产量提高质量上来达到补损的目的，有的则从改善经营管理、改进技术、节省原料、减低成本等方面补偿备战损失与打下今后发展生产的基础。现将十一月二十五日到十二月十日，各厂在增产竞赛运动中显著成绩分列于后：
    裕民实业公司与以第二面粉厂为重点，推动了运动的开展，党政工密切结合，深入领导，并结合及时解决职工福利，开展文娱工作。供销科等非生产部门当作为有力的配合，作到了多销多产。第二面粉厂原来每日产量最高为三百七十袋，竞赛开始计划增至四百五十袋，现在实际已达五百五十袋，并要帮助第一面粉厂产面二千袋，增强了两厂间的团结。工冰厂每部机子日轧棉由五百增至七百斤。织布厂电机原来一个工人只能织洋布卅五、六码，现已增至四十二码，有的突过五十码，工人赵小喜创最高纪录，提到五十七码。裕华铁工厂钳工部刘志精心研究，提高技术，由过去每天铣牙轮不满一百八十个提到四百四十四个。造纸厂解决了以破麻袋代替麻绳头之后，原料充足，成本减低，产量由原来每池每人一天出纸三百五十张增至五百五十张。制冰厂做阿母尼亚原定十天作出五百磅，结果四天完成了，而且质量大为提高。玻璃厂发明了以自行吹气管改造的工具，代替了用嘴吹以后，产量激增至三——四倍，吹的瓶子又快、又匀，并减少了成品的损失（原来吹一百个坏二十个，现减为十个）。
    铁路工厂有了打扒锯竞赛的经验与复原的基础，此次竞赛中原来两个月的生产计划，车辆所装修客货车共七十六辆，增产竞赛中争取一个半月完成，结果都是一个月零一天就提前完成了。装修所原定一个半月修好机车十二辆，现已有九辆出厂，职工情绪异常高涨，积极分子组织了突击组，完成自己任务后，帮助别人。在竞赛检查成品中，消除了检查员与工人传统的矛盾，加强了职工团结。
    大兴纱厂运动虽未全面开展，但个别部门也展开了群众性的增产竞赛，效率大大提高。保全部原来装一部分细纱机需时七日，解放后要五天装成一部，最近两天半就能完成。缠钢丝过去一天一班只能缠一部，这次竞赛最紧张时一天内即能缠到两部半。
    电话局十天完成三个月的计划，修好自动电话一千部，突击时职工每日平均工时十四小时，有的达到十七小时，并且组织了线路工人参加机械室的工作，学到了技术，打破了技师的保守观念。现在为了加强市政公用事业的建设计划再按自动电话三百部，并拟在桥东设公用电话一百八十部，这就大大增加了收入，估计两个月内完全可以补起备战中的损失。
    北方印刷局，在三个月整党学习胜利完结的基础上展开竞赛，运动开始领导上就提出了在保持职工健康、不降低质量、不损坏机器、不浪费原料等条件下增产竞赛，党政工密切结合，领导有组织、有计划，职工情绪高涨纷纷加义务工，自动要求实行大礼拜制，工人们说：“只要我们自愿的干就病不了”。非生产人员也作了配合，如伙夫同志提出改善伙食，顿顿变花样的保证。组织了八个半技术工人领班已成功。一厂铅印股每天平均八千五百印，较平常超过百分之三十二，且字字清楚，二厂平均增产百分之二十五，排字股一天排到四版，提高效率百分之六十七点四，一个月计划，十天完成。
    振华实业公司皮革厂制轮带备战前一个月内产一万尺，竞赛中十天内即产五千尺，烟厂由每日平均四百五十二条增至六百二十四条，皮革厂技师陈玉山两夜未睡觉发明了烤干机，烟厂技师张文增发明了新式切烟机一部。
    华北实业公司烟厂增产比过去超出百分之二十五，皮革厂出品节省时间百分之四十二，联合工厂提高产量百分之四十七点九，暖气设备改用暖墙节省很大开支。
    其它单位在节省原料，减少成本方面也表现了很好的成绩，如自来水公司中心是节省电费，利用废料，减少办公开支，两三个月能补足损失。酿酒厂过去每斤酒需红粮三斤，煤炭一斤半，现在五厂中已有三个厂子降到每斤只需红粮二斤十二两，煤一斤四两，并正研究以多用糠、少使粮食的办法，大大减低了成本。
    当然某些单位中还存在着若干缺点亟须改进，如重量不重质的偏向，裕华铁工厂铁砂四部原车坏了两部，裕民造胰厂原每天出四十箱，以后突增至一百四十箱，最近检查有五百箱质量不好。有的单位计划不切合实际以及某些职工中的锦标主义等偏向，以上均已指出并正改进中。
    （三）竞赛运动中的几点经验
    一、造成群众自觉自愿的增产竞赛运动的基础，一方面是革命形势的发展，粉碎了敌人的偷袭阴谋。职工看到运回了机器，情绪很高涨。再就是我们有了一年多的工作，职工有了初步觉悟，特别是经过了备战的体验，进一步认识了党，热烈的拥护党，而各单位根据备战复原表现实行奖惩，激发了职工的生产积极性，加强了劳动纪律。另外发展了一批新党员，培养了大批积极分子。这一切给这次的增产竞赛运动准备了更好的条件，也打下了提高生产的基础。
    二、领导上及时的抓紧上述条件，把铁路大厂补偿战争损失的布置，推广而成为全市的增产补损的竞赛运动，并立即得到职工的热烈响应。同样在工厂中凡是抓紧了职工情绪，进行切实的及时的组织领导的单位，运动就获得了很好的开展，收到了显著的成绩，凡是落后于群众的热情或只满足于一般号召，与行政布置，而没有具体的指导员与组织群众的积极性，运动就不能很好的展开，目前竞赛运动进一步推进也是如何加强领导与组织工作，使领导与群众热烈情绪相结合的问题。
    三、竞赛运动是群众自觉的运动，必须发动群众。领导运动的机构要吸收职工代表与工程师、技师参加，倾听意见，并放手使用各级干部使他们敢于负责，经过他们团结积极分子推动生产。在工人中展开民主讨论，走群众路线订计划、想办法，使增产计划从群众中来，再到群众中去。生产计划有了群众热烈的支持，就获得了胜利完成的保障。同时只要发动了群众，工人阶级伟大的创造能力与天才智慧就能表现出来。
    四、要在运动的高潮中，改进工厂中的一切工作。劳动纪律与各种制度必须建立，这是科学管理生产所必须的。但必须与发动群众的热情与自觉相结合，单纯强调行政管理不能全部解决问题。组织生产竞赛是领导革命职工生产的新的工作方法，是资本家不能作到的，而且我们有许多单位的劳动纪律与管理制度在运动中通过职工自愿的方式得到了解决。如果不能在运动中抓紧建立制度改造工作，加强职工团结，改善各方面的关系，就会减小了运动的成果。
    五、工厂中的行政、党的支部、职工会三方面要密切结合，领导统一，意见一致，如此，行政上的企业管理与生产计划就获得了党与职工会的有力支持，同时加强了运动的领导，又能在运动中加强与丰富支部与职工会的工作内容，改进了党政工在关系上的不够协调现象，使我们各方面的工作向前推进与提高一步。要善于把竞赛运动与建党、培养干部结合起来。运动中表现模范与积极分子要及时的吸收入党，大胆的提拔优秀的职工干部管理工厂。
    六、增加生产要与职工切身利益密切结合起来，才能使职工高涨的生产情绪巩固与持久。要掌握公私兼顾的原则，公家增加生产，工人就能增加收入，物资奖励是必要的。同时我们要及时的解决工人福利问题，很快实行调整工资方案与年终的加薪升级。职工们的义务是加工与增加工时，固然是阶级觉悟的表现，但应耐心说服工人，注意身体健康，并须付予加班费。另外在紧张的竞赛中，要有文化娱乐工作的配合，以调剂精神，恢复疲劳。
    七、要及时的表扬与奖励英雄、模范和发明创造，发扬群众的新英雄主义，但要使个人模范、集体模范结合起来，如果只是奖励个人模范，就往往会使其陷于孤立而脱离群众，对某些个人模范与有发明创造的应当表扬、奖励，号召大家向他们看齐，而受奖的本人再回头帮助落后，带动大家，以加强团结互助，完成生产任务。
    八、在生产竞赛中产量和质量要提到同等重要的地位。在运动中往往会产生为完成任务，追求数量而不重质量的毛病，这必须从提高与改进技术，建立成品登记检查等制度中来解决。
