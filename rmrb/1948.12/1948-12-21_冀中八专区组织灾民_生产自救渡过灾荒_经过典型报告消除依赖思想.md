Jizhong News: This year, Jinghai, Cangxian, Renqiu, Wenxin, and other six counties in the Eighth District suffered severe water, drought, and insect disasters in most villages. In most areas, no grain was harvested this autumn, and the remaining areas saw a reduction of 50-60% or 30-40%. In response to these circumstances, the Jizhong Eighth District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party specifically called on cadres in disaster areas to make every effort to lead and organize the masses to carry out production and self-help, provide loans, and give necessary relief to those who cannot survive. Based on the masses' production foundation, habits, and demands, the Jinghai County Committee convened an expanded cadre meeting of more than 370 people from counties, districts, and villages. Through the reports of typical villages and typical groups, they dispelled the village cadres' reliance on loans and the district cadres' patronizing view that they could not organize mass production without loans. All cadres in the Eleventh District responded to the call of the County Committee and began saving half an ounce of rice every day from September. Four cadres from the Sixth and Seventh Districts led young and middle-aged people from the disaster areas to work short-term jobs in non-disaster areas. The Eighth District used 1,715 jin of loaned grain to organize 17 households, including village cadres, military personnel, and martyrs' families in Daliu Village, to transport reeds and collect mats, driving 67 households to weave mats. According to the statistics of 17 villages, a total of 31 groups were formed, and 878 mat-weaving households solved their living difficulties.

In Renqiu, the villages along the Qianli Dyke had divided reed ponds among the masses for "chu shan," but due to the large capital required, the masses relied on loans, so the old organization could not be established. Comrade Wang Youlin, the secretary of the County Committee, personally went to Xidawu Village to help the masses study how to sell unnecessary floating wealth as capital using accounting methods, and called on the masses to invest in "chu shan." Under the leadership of village cadres and Party members, a total of 30,000 yuan (new currency) was raised. 787 households in the village participated in the "chu shan" group, accounting for 60% of the village's households. It is estimated that the "shan" land can produce 60,000 reeds, worth 900,000 yuan (new currency, same below); the fish profits will be even greater. Under the influence of this village, the famous Pipahe, Xidadi, and Beidadi "shan wo" in Baiyangdian were also fully organized. According to the statistics of 11 villages, a total of 48 "chu shan" groups were formed, with 2,240 households. (Note: "Chu shan" is a method of fishing in reed ponds.)

　　　　Organizing Transportation and Sales; Curing Fish and Weaving Cloth

Based on production conditions and the habits of the masses, Wenxin organized the masses to transport goods. Liu Xichun from Liugong Village in the First District pushed dried shrimp to Botou and Dezhou to exchange for oil, which took 12 days round trip, earning a net profit of 1,000 yuan. Cadres in the Fifth District used this example to mobilize the masses, launching 40 small carts from 17 villages to engage in transportation and sales. In Dongxi Dao'an Village, Huanghua County, 40 fish-curing groups were organized, and they sold more than 230,000 yuan worth of fish in 12 days. The Xianxian Promotion Agency transported more than 1,000 jin of hemp, more than 30 jin of tin, and 40 bamboo poles from Shunde to help the disaster victims in 12 villages to cure fish.

　　　　Boiling Saltpeter and Drying Salt; Collecting Firewood and Picking Vegetables

Wang Yunzhi, a women's representative from the Third Township of Hejian City, organized three people to boil saltpeter, and on the morning of August 17th, they scraped three large carts of saltpeter soil. More than 100 women from Xingcun in Jianguo collected more than 11,000 jin of firewood and grass in four days. In Xiaocaozong Village, Cangxian County, the number of salt pans developed from two households with two salt pans to 35 households with 10 salt pans; in Dacaozong, 25 households with six salt pans were developed, with men repairing the beaches and drying salt, and women collecting firewood and picking yellow vegetables.

Wenxin, Jinghai, and Dacheng counties built more than 150 li of enclosure embankments, organizing disaster victims to dig wild pears, collect grass seeds, and pick wild mung beans outside the embankments. According to incomplete statistics from 69 villages in Wenxin and Jinghai before October 15th, 3,459 children and other semi-labor forces went out early and returned late by boat to pick every day. From the beginning to the present, a total of 11,000 jin of wild vegetables have been collected, 9,396 jin of grass seeds have been swept, and 191,000 jin of ground pears have been dug. Under the loan support of the democratic government and the strong leadership of Party and government cadres, according to Jinghai, Wenxin, Cangxian, and other six counties, more than 20 kinds of cooperative and mutual aid production organizations such as fish curing, mat weaving, saltpeter boiling, flour mills, transportation and sales, workshops, and contracting work have been organized, totaling 2,087 groups, and the lives of 15,758 disaster-stricken households have been resolved.

Although these achievements have been obtained, some deviations and shortcomings have also occurred in leading and organizing the masses to carry out production and self-help. For example, after correcting the patronizing view of relying on loans, some cadres in Jinghai and other counties did not dare to publicize loans, but carried out individual household relief; some even forced the masses to sell furniture and forcibly raised private funds; some cadres did not give village cadres organizational figures based on the situation and set deadlines for completion, thus causing the village cadres to issue coercive orders and become detached from the masses. Some cadres only cared about organizing new organizations and did not lead the spontaneous organizations of the masses. These must be overcome in the future.

### 冀中八专区组织灾民　生产自救渡过灾荒  经过典型报告消除依赖思想

　　冀中八专区组织灾民
    生产自救渡过灾荒
    经过典型报告消除依赖思想
    【冀中讯】今年八分区静海、沧县、任邱、文新等六县大部村庄遭受严重水、旱、虫灾。大部地区今秋籽粒未见，其余减收五六成或三四成。根据这些情况，中共冀中八地委特号召灾区干部用全力领导与组织群众开展生产自救，举办贷款，对没法生活的给以必要的救济。静海县委根据群众的生产基础、习惯和要求，召开了县区村三百七十多人的扩大干部会，通过典型村典型组的报告，打通了村干部依赖贷款的思想，和区干部认为没有贷款就不能组织群众生产的恩赐观点。十一区全体干部，响应县委的号召，从九月份开始每天节约半两米。六、七区四个干部带领灾区青壮年，到非灾区包工打短。八区用一千七百一十五斤贷粮，组织大刘村村干军工烈属等十七户运苇收席，带动起六十七户织席的。据十七个村的统计，共组成三十一个组，八百七十八户席民解决了生活困难。
    任邱沿千里堤的村庄，群众分得的苇塘出汕，因用资本太大，群众依靠贷款，所以老组织不起来。县委书记王友林同志，亲自到西大坞村，帮助群众用算账方式，研究着把不需要的浮财卖了作资本，号召群众投资出汕，在村干党员的带头下，共集资三万元（新币）。全村七百八十七户参加出汕组，占全村户数的百分之六十。估计汕地能出苇六万个，值九十万元（新币下同）；鱼利将更大。在这村的影响下，白洋淀有名的琵琶鹤、西大地、北大地等汕窝也完全组织起来。据十一个村的统计，共组成了四十八个出汕组，二千二百四十户。（注：“出汕”即在苇塘打鱼的一种方法。）
    　　　　组织运销　治鱼织布
    文新根据生产条件和群众的习惯，组织群众调运。一区刘公村刘喜纯推干虾到泊头、德州去换油，来回十二天，得纯利一千元。五区区干部用这个例子来动员群众，发动了十七个村四十辆小车做起运销来。黄骅县东西道安两村，组织起四十个治鱼组，捕鱼十二天就卖了二十三万余元。献县推进社，从顺德运来一千多斤麻，三十多斤锡，四十根竹竿，扶助了十二个村的灾民治鱼。
    　　　　熬硝晒盐　拾柴拾菜
    河间市三乡妇女代表王云芝，组织三个人熬硝，八月十七日早晨，就刮硝土三大车。建国邢村一百多妇女，四天拾柴打草一万一千多斤。沧县小草冢村，由两户两个盐滩发展到三十五户十个盐滩；大草冢发展起二十五户六个盐滩，男的修滩晒盐，女的拾柴划拾黄菜。
    文新、静海、大城三县，修起一百五十多里的围洼埝，组织灾民在埝外挖草梨、打草籽、拾野绿豆等。据文新、静海十月十五日以前六十九个村不完全的统计，每天有三千四百五十九个儿童和其他半劳力的群众，起早恋晚的坐着船去拾。从开始到眼下，共采野菜一万一千斤，扫草籽九千三百九十六斤，刨地梨十九万一千斤。经过民主政府的贷款扶植，和党政民干部的坚强领导下，据静海、文新、沧县、等六个县共组织起治鱼、织席、熬硝、粉坊、运销、作坊、包工等二十多种合作互助生产组织，共计二千零八十七组，一万五千七百五十八户灾民的生活得到解决。
    虽然得到这些成绩，可是在领导和组织群众生产自救当中，也发生了一些偏向和缺点。如在纠正依赖贷款的恩赐观点以后，静海等县有的干部就不敢宣传贷款，而进行个别户的赈济；更有的强制群众变卖家具，硬集私资；有的干部不根据情况，硬给村干部布置组织数字，限期完成；因此造成了村干的强迫命令脱离群众。更有的干部只管组织新的，不去领导群众的自发的组织。这些今后必须注意克服。
