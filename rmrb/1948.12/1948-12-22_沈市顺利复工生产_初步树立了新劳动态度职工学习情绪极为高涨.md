Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 19th. The work of the employees in Shenyang City has gradually unfolded in the first month after the city's liberation. Under the leadership of the Preparatory Committee of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, employee representative meetings and trade union preparatory committees have been established in various state-owned factories. Before the official establishment of the trade unions, the employee representative meetings have become an important organizational form for organizing and educating workers. Its tasks are: to unite the employees of each factory, actively restore production, learn from each other, reflect the opinions of the employees, and gradually develop employee welfare undertakings. Employees of many private factories are also actively preparing to form trade unions. The preparatory committees for the trade unions of workers in the shoe industry and grain processing industry in Heping District were established on the 4th and 8th of this month, respectively. Under the leadership of the employee representative meetings, the employees have a high level of enthusiasm for learning. The Railway Bureau, Post and Telecommunications Bureau, Military Industry Department, Military Supplies Department, Textile Administration Bureau, and various state-owned factories in Tiexi District in the city have successively opened short-term training courses for employees. Among them, four or five larger training courses trained more than 1,400 employees in the second half of November. The employee work in the past month proves that running short-term training courses for employees is an effective way to carry out propaganda and education for employees in the new areas and to discover and cultivate activists. After a month of education and training, the employees' awareness has been continuously improved, and a new attitude towards labor has been initially established, which ensures the smooth resumption of production. Wu Shoufeng, a veteran worker at the smelting plant, said: "We workers must cherish our factories as we cherish our own pots, bowls, and chopsticks. We should try to use equipment that should last for three or five years for six or seven years." After receiving training, workers in smelting, rubber, and other factories automatically criticized individual workers who were "dragging their feet" or violating discipline. Workers from a certain factory volunteered to work overtime day and night to repair weapons for the garrison troops. The Railway Workers' Union office receives more than 20 calls and letters from workers every day, asking them to answer questions they encounter in their studies. Some even take the trolley from far away to ask for answers.
    The current problems in the city's employee work are that the progress is still uneven. The work methods of some trade union cadres still have some small-scale approaches. For example, in a large factory, the cadres only talked to two or three workers to carry out propaganda and education. In another large factory with tens of thousands of workers, only more than 20 workers were selected to go to the training courses. Some factories simply carry out propaganda and education for workers without integrating it well with organizational work. In order to further develop the employee work, the Shenyang Federation of Trade Unions Preparatory Committee recently convened a joint meeting of employee cadres in the city, once again proposing that attention should be paid to widely carrying out propaganda and education for employees, raising the awareness of employees, and at the same time combining it with appropriate and guided organizational work, cultivating activists, and mobilizing the vast number of employees to actively resume production. And, according to possibility and necessity, moderately develop employee welfare work.

　　沈市顺利复工生产
    初步树立了新劳动态度职工学习情绪极为高涨
    【新华社沈阳十九日电】沈阳市的职工工作，在该市解放后的第一个月中已逐渐展开。在市总工会筹备委员会的领导下，各公营工厂已先后成立职工代表会议和工会筹委会。在工会正式成立以前，职工代表会议已成为组织教育工人的重要组织形式。它的任务是：团结各厂职工，积极恢复生产，互助学习，反映职工意见，并逐步举办职工福利事业。许多私营工厂的职工，也纷纷筹组工会。和平区鞋业与粮米加工业工人的工会筹委会，已于本月四日及八日分别成立。在职工代表会的领导下，职工学习热情很高。该市铁路局、邮电局、军工部、军需部、纺织管理局及铁西区各公营工厂，先后开办了职工短期训练班。其中四五处较大的训练班，十一月份下半月即训练了一千四百余职工。一个月来的职工工作证明：开办职工短期训练班，是向新区职工进行宣传教育、发现与培养积极分子的有效办法。职工们经过一个月的教育训练，觉悟不断提高，初步树立起新的劳动态度，保证了复工生产的顺利进行。冶炼厂的老工友吴守奉说：“我们工人要象爱护自家的锅、碗、筷子一样地爱护咱们的工厂。应该用三、五年的器材，要想办法用它六、七年。”冶炼、橡胶等厂的工友受训后，自动地对“磨洋工”或不守纪律的个别工友进行了批评。某厂工友自报奋勇，日夜加班，给驻军修理武器。铁路职工会办事处每天接到二十余工友电话和来信，要求给他们解答学习中遇到的问题。有的甚至从很远的地方坐电车来请求解答问题。
    该市职工工作中目前存在的问题是进展尚不平衡。有些工运工作干部的工作方法还存在着某些小手小脚的作风。如在某大工厂中，干部只找了两三个工人谈话，进行宣传教育，在另一成万工人的大工厂中，也只抽调了二十多个工人去训练班学习。有的工厂则单纯对工人进行宣传教育，而没有与组织工作很好结合起来。为进一步开展职工工作，沈阳职工总会筹委会最近曾召开全市职工干部联席会，再次提出应注意广泛地向职工进行宣传教育，提高职工觉悟，同时结合进行适当的有领导的组织工作，培养积极分子，动员广大职工，积极复工生产。并按照可能与必要，酌量开展职工福利工作。
