The North China People's Government
Stipulates Method for Converting Payments to Rice
Agricultural Tax to be Converted to Rice Based on the Rice Price Collected from the People
[This Newspaper's Dispatch] The North China People's Government issued a regulation on converting payments to rice on November 16th. The text is as follows: It is determined that the control of our district's annual budget, the preparation of final accounts, and the arrangement of various tax revenue tasks are all calculated in terms of millet. Therefore, all tax payments in this region should be converted to rice based on the local rice price at the time of deposit, in order to facilitate calculation and control. However, according to the current situation, the methods for converting various tax payments to rice are quite inconsistent among tax collection departments at all levels. Some convert to rice and enter the accounts at the time of deposit, some convert to rice and report after the collection is completed, and some do not convert at the lower level, and the upper level calculates the total account. Due to the inconsistent and inconsistent methods of converting to rice, it affects the inspection of the completion of the collection task, and makes it impossible for accounting at all levels to make notes at any time. Accounting procedures are protracted and unclear, making it difficult for financial leaders to grasp the collection situation. In order to unify the method of converting tax payments to rice and truly grasp the income situation, it is decided:
    1. When collecting agricultural tax, all payments collected shall be converted to rice at the rice price collected from the masses when they are handed over to the treasury. If the rice price changes too quickly, the average rice price of the day or two or three days can be used for conversion, and there is no need to wait until the end of the collection before converting to rice for remittance.
    2. Other tax payments (including industrial and commercial tax, transaction tax, import and export tax, stamp tax, salt tax, tobacco tax, wine tax, wage income tax, license tax, etc.) shall be converted to rice at the local medium rice price when paying to the treasury. Treasuries at all levels have the responsibility to check whether the rice price is reasonable. If it is unreasonable, they may raise opinions to the paying agency for discussion and modification. If the paying agency does not correct it, the treasury may report the details to the North China People's Government level by level for handling. In the future, whether the task of the tax authority is completed will be based on this converted rice number as the assessment basis (deed tax, administrative fines, confiscated price changes, and all other payments are subject to the same method of converting to rice).

　　华北人民政府
    规定征款折米办法
    农业税一律按向群众征收的米价折米
    【本报讯】华北人民政府十一月十六日发布关于征款折米的规定，文如下：查我区岁入预算之掌握，决算之编制，以及各项税收任务之布置，均以小米为计算单位，因之本区一切税收款项，均应按入库时之当地米价折米，以便于计算与掌握，但根据目前情况，各级税款经收部门对各种税收款项之折米办法颇不一致，入库时即行折米入帐者有之，征收结束后折米上报者有之，下级不折米上级算总帐者亦有之，由于折米办法不统一不一致，就影响对征收任务完成程度的检查，并使各级会计不能随时注帐，会计手续拖拉不清，使财政领导部门难以掌握征收情况。为统一税收款项折米办法，确实掌握收入情况，特决定：
    一、征收农业税时，所征收之款项于交金库时，一律按向群众征收之米价折米，如因征收米价变动太快，可以按当日或二三日之平均米价折米，不必等待征收结束时，再行折米上解。
    二、其他税收款（包括工商税、交易税、出入口税、印花税、盐税、烟税、酒税、工资所得税、牌照税等。），按向金库交款时当地中等米价折米，各级金库有责任检查米价是否合理，如不合理，得向交款机关提出意见商讨修改，交款机关如不纠正，金库得将当时详情，逐级向上反映至华北人民政府处理。今后税收机关任务完成与否，即以此折米数为考核依据（契税及行政罚款没收变价和其他一切款项均同此折米办法）。
