　　【Baoding Telegram】Before fleeing, Liu Hua'nan's Kuomintang bandit troops, who were entrenched in Baoding, used extremely cruel tortures, massacres, beatings, and humiliation against the Hui compatriots in the city. The Kuomintang's "Committee for the Elimination of Traitors" (an intelligence organization of the Jiang bandits for massacring innocent people) arrested ninety Hui people in Nanbaiyi Alley, Huihui Party, Houfuying, and Xiaojingzhen Temple Hui residential areas. Among them, forty-nine people were brutally beaten by the Jiang bandits, and thirty-two people were imprisoned and subjected to tortures such as electric shocks, smashing feet and dislocating bones, burning with hot pokers, pouring boiling water, and hanging upside down in wells. They even burned the nipples of seven women with incense sticks. The Jiang bandits openly declared: "All the Hui people in the city should be killed." After our army began to attack the city, the Jiang bandits drove many Hui people into the mosque, freezing them for three nights. They also killed Hui people An Jie and Bai Xingwang with indiscriminate punishment and shot An Deyu; and forcibly took away a group of Hui people. As of now, the whereabouts of twenty-four people in the Huihui Camp are unknown.

　　On the fourth day after the city's liberation (the 27th), when reporters went to the mosque in Nanbaiyi Alley to comfort the Hui compatriots, they poured out their hearts with grief and indignation as if they had met their own relatives: "From July 25th to August 28th, the pseudo-Commissioner's Office and the 'Committee for the Elimination of Traitors' arrested thirty-two Hui people. Some were beaten to death, some disappeared without a trace, and those who didn't die suffered unspeakable tortures!" Hui resident Zhang Xiutian said: "The bandit soldiers dragged us away in the dark of night and beat us unconscious with four heavy clubs. When I woke up, I was hanging upside down in the well. If it hadn't been for the People's Liberation Army attacking the city, we would have lost our lives." Ma Yaozong has a copper-sized blood blister on his leg. He told reporters: "On the night of July 25th, they dragged me away and put me in a pressing frame, gave me electric shocks, and hung me upside down from the main beam. Two people used clubs to beat me all over, and the bones of my knees were exposed." As he spoke, his voice trembled with anger. A forty-year-old woman, Ma Nvzi, said: "On the night of August 2nd, they dragged my mother and me away, beating us all over until we were covered in wounds, and they even burned my mother's nipples with incense sticks..." An old man in tattered clothes stood there blankly, unable to speak. He was the father of Xingwang, who was killed by the bandit soldiers. Finally, he said to the reporter with indignation: "I can't live anymore. The bandit soldiers killed my child, and the family is old and young..."

　　The blood and tears of the Hui people in Baoding City will be transformed into strength. They said: "Now that the Communist Party is in charge, we want revenge!" They said: "Even if they (referring to the war criminals) run to the ends of the earth, we will catch them back, we must vent this anger!"

　　保定回胞一提到刘匪就愤恨万分
  　他跑到天边也要捉回来
    【保定电】原盘据在保定的蒋匪刘化南部，临逃窜前，曾用了极其残忍的酷刑、屠杀、毒打和污辱该市回民同胞。国民党“肃奸委员会”（按为蒋匪屠杀无辜人民之特务组织），曾在南白衣巷、回回党、厚复盈、小清真寺各回民街，抓捕回民九十人。其中四十九人遭到蒋匪毒打，三十二人被囚在监狱里，施以通电流、砸脚滑骨、火筷子烫、浇开水、倒吊在井里等等毒刑，还用香火烧过七个妇女的奶头。蒋匪公开声称：“城里的回民统统该杀死。”我军攻城开始后，蒋匪把好些回民赶到清真寺内，冻了三夜。并用乱刑杀死回民安杰、白兴旺，枪杀了安德裕；又强拉走一部回民。直到现在，回回营还有二十四人活不见人，死不见尸。
    当该市解放后的第四天（二十七日），记者到南白衣巷的清真寺去慰问回民同胞时，他们象见了亲人一样，悲愤地倾吐他们心里的话：“从七月二十五到八月二十八，伪专员公署和“肃奸委员会”抓走了三十二个回民，有的打死，有的没了音信，没死的受的苦刑就提不的啦！”回民张秀田说：“黑夜里匪军把俺们拉去，四大棍子打的不觉事了，醒过来又倒空着悬到井里吊着。要不是解放军攻城，俺们可就没命了。一马耀宗腿上还有铜子大的血窟隆，他告诉记者：“七月二十五黑夜把我抓去压杆子，过电流，倒空着吊到大梁上，两人用棍子乱在身上敲，膝盖上的骨头都露出来了。”他说话时，气愤得声音发抖。四十岁的妇女马女子说：“八月初二黑夜，把俺娘儿俩拉去，打的浑身没了一点好地方，还用香火烧妈妈（奶头），……”一个穿着破烂衣服的老头呆呆的立着，说不出话来，他是被匪军杀死的兴旺的父亲。最后他才愤激地对记者说：“我活不了啦，匪军把我的孩子杀死，一家子老的老，小的小……”。
    保定全市回民的血泪，将变成力量。他们说：“有了共产党给作主，俺们要报仇！”他们说：“他们（指战犯）跑到天边上，也要逮回他们来，俺们要出这口气！”
