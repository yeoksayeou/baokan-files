Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 24th. Dutch imperialism formally announced a nationwide offensive against Indonesia on the morning of the 19th. At the same time, it used paratroopers to suddenly occupy the Indonesian capital of Yogyakarta, and the heads of the Indonesian government were successively arrested by the Dutch army.

　　The Dutch imperialists had long been preparing for this military offensive. Since the Dutch government announced the breakdown of negotiations with the Indonesian government on the 11th of this month, it has been assembling heavy troops and actively preparing for an armed offensive. On the morning of the 18th of this month, the Dutch government issued a public statement after an emergency cabinet meeting, announcing the formal establishment of a "provisional federal government of the United States of Indonesia excluding the Republic of Indonesia" and declaring the "Renville Agreement" signed with Indonesia on January 17th of this year invalid. The Dutch government will maintain freedom of action in the future. At 6:00 a.m. on the 19th, the Dutch army, navy, and air force moved out simultaneously. Dutch paratroopers first landed near Yogyakarta and occupied the city at 3:00 p.m. The heads of the Indonesian traitorous government, including President Sukarno, Prime Minister Hatta, Foreign Minister Salim, former Prime Minister Sjahrir, Army Commander-in-Chief Sudirman, and Chairman of the National Assembly Executive Committee Asaat, were all arrested by the Dutch army. The Dutch marines simultaneously landed on the northeastern coast of Java west of Surabaya and advanced towards Cipu, one of Java's largest oilfield centers. One route of the Dutch army is continuing to advance east, crossing Kibuman, 80 kilometers west of Yogyakarta; another route has invaded Kibanjen south of Malang and Tolon southeast of Malang. In Sumatra, the Dutch army has also invaded the northeastern province of Asahan.

　　The Indonesian reactionary government, which internally implements anti-communism and anti-people policies and externally implements betrayal and surrender, was completely unprepared for this offensive by the Dutch army. After the Netherlands announced on the 11th that negotiations could not continue, the Hatta government still sent a note to the Netherlands, expressing its willingness to make "certain concessions" to resume negotiations. The Indonesian government forces offered little resistance in the face of such an offensive by the Dutch army. According to a Dutch military communiqué on the 20th, only three Dutch soldiers were injured during the occupation of Yogyakarta. The result of the surrender policy implemented by the traitors of the Hatta government was that they themselves became prisoners of Dutch imperialism.

　　U.S. imperialism is clearly encouraging the Dutch imperialist colonial enslavement war. According to the Associated Press, when the Netherlands announced on the 11th that negotiations with the Indonesian government could not continue, the U.S. State Department had been constantly exchanging views with the Netherlands. After the U.S.-equipped Dutch army officially launched its offensive, the U.S. authorities stated that "the United States is currently taking a wait-and-see attitude" (Associated Press). Former U.S. representative to the United Nations Indonesia Committee, Dubois,坦白, admitted that this offensive by the Dutch army "is the beginning of a colonial war, and we are funding the Netherlands with money."

### 荷兰帝国主义军队　占领印尼首都日惹　哈达傀儡政府首脑悉数被俘

　　荷兰帝国主义军队
  　占领印尼首都日惹
  　哈达傀儡政府首脑悉数被俘
    【新华社陕北二十四日电】荷兰帝国主义已于十九日晨正式宣布向印尼全国发动进攻，同时并以伞兵突袭占领印尼首都日惹，印尼政府首脑人员已相继为荷军拘捕。
    荷兰帝国主义的这次军事进攻，事先早有准备。荷兰政府自从本月十一日宣布与印尼政府的谈判破裂以后，便在集结重兵，积极准备武装进攻。本月十八日晨，荷兰政府在紧急阁议后，发表公报，宣布正式成立一个“印尼共和国除外的印尼合众国临时联邦政府”并宣告今年一月十七日与印尼签订的“伦维尔协定”无效，荷兰政府今后保持行动的自由。十九日上午六时，荷兰陆海空军同时出动。荷兰的伞兵首先在日惹附近降落，下午三时占领该城。印尼卖国政府首脑人物，包括总统苏加诺、总理哈达、外长沙立姆、前总理沙利尔、陆军总司令苏迪曼、国会执行委员会主席阿萨特等全部被荷军逮捕。荷兰的海军陆战队，同时在泗水以西的爪哇东北部海岸登陆，向爪哇最大油田中心之一的芝普城前进。荷兰的陆军，一路正越过日惹以西八十公里处的基布曼继续东进；另一路已侵占玛琅以南的基班真及玛琅东南的托伦。在苏门答腊，荷兰陆军亦已侵入东北部的亚沙汗省。
    对内实行反共反人民，对外实行叛卖投降的印尼反动政府，对于荷军的这次进攻，事先毫无警惕。在荷兰于十一日宣布谈判不能继续以后，哈达政府犹向荷兰提出照会，表示愿作“某种让步”，以恢复谈判。印尼政府军队在这样荷军进攻的面前，很少抵抗。据荷军二十日公报声称：在占领日惹时，荷军仅有三名受伤。哈达政府的叛卖者们实行投降政策的结果，却使得它们本身做了荷兰帝国主义的阶下囚。
    美国帝国主义是显然鼓励荷兰帝国主义的殖民地奴役战争的。据合众社透露：当荷兰于十一日宣布与印尼政府的谈判不能继续时，美国务院曾与荷兰不断交换意见。在此次美国装备的荷军正式发动进攻之后，美国当局却表示“美国目前尚持观望态度”（美联社）。美国前驻联合国印尼委员会代表杜博伊斯坦白承认：这次荷军的进攻，“是殖民战争的开端，而我们却以款项资助荷兰”。
