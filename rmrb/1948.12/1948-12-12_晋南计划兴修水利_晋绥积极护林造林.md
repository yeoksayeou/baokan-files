    Xinhua News Agency, Linfen, 10th. Southern Shanxi counties plan to continue developing water conservancy projects next year. The specific plans for the new construction and restoration of water conservancy projects in each county were formulated according to the instructions of the Jin-Sui Border Region Administrative Office to vigorously develop water conservancy projects. In addition to the two major water conservancy projects of the Sijiao River in Yuncheng and the Gudui River in Xinjiang County, which are being surveyed by the Administrative Office's engineering team, the eight counties under the Ninth Special District Office, including Xi County and Fenxi, plan to open 37 canals this winter and next spring, which can irrigate more than 44,400 mu of land and require more than 148,000 workdays. Xiangling County, directly under the Jin-Sui Border Region, plans to build and restore five canals, repair 180 old waterwheels, and install one water pump, which can increase the area of irrigated land by 40,000 mu. In addition, the Tongli Canal, which runs through Hongdong, Zhaocheng, and Linfen counties, also has expansion plans. The canal's water conservancy bureau plans to expand the downstream canal body by six feet, which can increase the area of irrigated land by 20,000 mu. According to existing materials, it is estimated that the entire Southern Shanxi region will increase the area of irrigated land by a total of 100,440 mu next year. In recent years, Southern Shanxi has newly built and restored 24 large canals, increasing the area of irrigated land by 137,000 mu. Among them, the longest Tongli Canal is 80 li long and irrigates 67,300 mu of land. The irrigated land has increased production by 234,000 shi, which is more than two and a half times the original output.

    Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui, 10th. In order to regulate climate and water volume to reduce crop losses, the Jin-Sui Border Region Forestry Committee actively promotes forest protection and afforestation. The committee has established forest protection sub-stations in Shenchi, Wuzhai, Guo County, and Kelan, and has sent a group of cadres to work there. The Jin-Sui Liberated Area is located in the northwestern plateau area, and crops often suffer losses due to the attacks of hot winds from the northwest desert. The forest area from Jiaocheng in central Shanxi, through Fangshan, Lan County, to Kelan, Ningwu, and Shenchi in northern Shanxi, has seen a gradual decrease in forest trees due to the large-scale logging by the Japanese puppet regime during the Anti-Japanese War, as well as the insufficient attention paid to forest protection by our leadership organs at all levels in the past. In recent years, crops have suffered more from drought, floods, hail and other disasters than in the past. Therefore, the Forestry Committee has determined: (1) In mountainous forest areas, establish forest protection committees through local governments to manage and protect forests. It is strictly forbidden to cut down trees. (2) Investigate small forest areas. Livestock are prohibited from entering these forest areas to avoid damage. (3) Plant tree seeds in a planned manner to develop new forest areas. (4) Protect and cultivate all flood and sand control trees on the sides of fields, riverbanks, canals, and roads in large quantities.

    晋南计划兴修水利
    晋绥积极护林造林
    【新华社临汾十日电】晋南各县计划明年继续开展水利事业。各县新修与恢复水利的具体计划系根据晋绥边区行署大力开展水利事业的指示订出。除行署工程队正在测量的运城四交河和新绛县古堆河两大水利工程外，九专署所属隰县、汾西等八个县计划今冬明春开渠三十七条，可浇地四万四千四百余亩，需工十四万八千余个。晋绥边区直属县襄陵全县计划新修与恢复水渠五条，修理旧水车一百八十辆，装置抽水机一架，可增水地四万亩。此外贯通洪洞、赵城、临汾三县之通利渠亦有扩大计划，该渠水利局拟将该渠下游渠身扩大六尺，可增水地两万亩。据现有材料，晋南全区预计明年将共增加水地十万零四千四百亩。年来晋南已新修与恢复较大水渠二十四条，增加水地十三万七千亩。其中最长的一条通利渠，全长八十里，浇地六万七千三百亩。所浇地增加产量二十三万四千石，较原产量多两倍半。
    【新华社晋绥十日电】为了调节气候和水量以减少农作物的损失，晋绥边区林业委员会积极提倡护林造林。该会在神池、五寨、崞县、岢岚成立护林分卡，已派出一批干部前往工作。晋绥解放区位于西北高原地带，农作物常因来自西北沙漠热风的袭击而受到损失。由晋中之交城经方山、岚县至晋北之岢岚、宁武、神池等地的森林地区，由于抗日战争时期日伪的大肆砍伐，以及我各级领导机关过去对护林工作重视不够，林木日见减少，年来农作物所受旱涝冰雹等灾害已较过去为甚。因此林业委员会确定：（一）在靠山林地区，通过当地政府成立护林委员会以管理保护森林。严禁砍伐树木。（二）调查小林区。此等林区禁止牛羊群入内，以免损坏。（三）有计划播种树子，发展新林区。（四）保护与大量培植所有地畔、河岸、渠边、路旁之防洪防沙树木。
