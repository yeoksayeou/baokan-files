　　Propaganda Department of the Municipal Party Committee and the Federation of Trade Unions
　　Preparing for New Year Propaganda
    [Shijiazhuang City News] The Propaganda Department of the Shijiazhuang Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions held a preparatory meeting for New Year propaganda on the 20th. After enthusiastic discussions by various units at the meeting, it was decided that the content of the propaganda would focus on the current situation and the city's construction over the past year, with particular emphasis on publicizing the victorious development of the current war situation and the unprecedented growth of the strength of the Chinese and world people, so that the masses would have a correct understanding of fundamentally defeating the Kuomintang reactionaries and the overall world situation in about a year. In addition, emphasis should be placed on publicizing the achievements in various construction projects in the city over the past year, as well as the model deeds and figures in production and war preparedness. In terms of propaganda methods, the practice of pure entertainment for the sake of entertainment should be opposed, and new, diversified, and substantive things must be created. The meeting also raised several issues: requiring literary and art workers to go to factories to help with work, organizing a preparatory committee for New Year entertainment activities; and unified leadership and command of activities in various factories. All organs, groups, etc., should also boldly give play to the creativity of the masses and actively participate in New Year entertainment and propaganda activities.

    【石家庄市讯】中共石家庄市委宣传部，市总工会于二十日召开新年宣传筹备会议。会上经各单位热烈讨论，决定宣传的内容以目前形势与本市一年来建设为主，特别强调宣传目前战争形势的胜利发展，中国及世界人民力量的空前壮大，使群众对于一年左右根本打垮国民党反动派和整个的世界形势有一个正确的认识。另外强调宣传一年来本市各种建设中的成绩，生产、备战中的各种模范事迹、人物。在宣传的方式上，反对单纯为娱乐而娱乐的做法，必须创造新的、多样化的、有内容的东西。会上并提出几个问题：要求文艺工作者下厂帮助工作，组织新年文娱活动筹委会；统一领导指挥各厂活动。各机关、团体等也要大胆的发挥群众创造性，积极参加新年文娱宣传活动。
