During the conclusion of land reform, clearly defining class status and revising designations is a crucial step. The following is a preliminary summary of the revision of class designations in the first group of villages in Changzhi that have completed land reform. It is provided for reference by other regions:

In Changzhi, villages generally adopted the following three steps when revising class designations:

The first step: the gestation and preparation stage, mainly involving publicizing policies, explaining class division standards, and clarifying the definitions and treatment of each class. This stage effectively addresses two issues: first, overcoming the resistance of cadres and some of the masses to the revision of designations; and second, through discussion, enabling cadres and the masses to understand the policies and master the standards themselves. In specific implementation: first, hold a branch meeting to explain why to divide classes and the definitions and treatment of each, and conduct trial divisions in conjunction with households in the village that have been struggled against. For example, in Nandong Village, Second District, three points were emphasized: 1. Standards and spirit, 2. Possession of means of production, 3. Amount and duration of exploitation. During the trial divisions, it was found that cadres and party members generally had resistance, fearing admitting mistakes and finding reasons to raise the class status. For example, cadres in Shenjiazhuang said that a certain household was an evil tyrant and another was a traitor, and they were unwilling to revise the designation anyway. They said: "We used to struggle against and beat people, and now we have to say good things to them, we can't do it!" Some said angrily: "Wasn't a single household struggled against correctly? Were they all wrong?" "The masses were mobilized to struggle in the past, and now it's wrong again, how can we face people?" In short, village cadres were afraid to make self-criticisms and admit mistakes, fearing that responsibility would be shifted to them, and therefore resisted revising the class designations. On the part of the masses, the main concern was the fear of returning property, making them reluctant to revise designations, mainly the new middle peasants. These people had conflicts in their thinking when proposing to correct wrongly designated class statuses, knowing that someone was a middle peasant but fearing that classifying them as a middle peasant would mean returning property, so they were also unwilling to revise the designation.

To solve these problems, first, clearly distinguish right from wrong, and assign responsibility separately, explaining that the leadership at the time did not grasp the policies well, did not clearly explain the standards for dividing classes, and that the village cadres should not be held fully responsible for wrong struggles. While the leadership made self-criticisms, they also enlightened the village cadres to recognize and correct mistakes, and revise class designations according to policies, so that the peasants could truly unite and isolate the enemy; if the designations were not revised, friends would be classified into the enemy camp, and the peasants would not dare to produce and prosper, and internal chaos would ensue. Then, combined with the village situation, the importance of revising class designations was studied. Xiaqin Village reported: "Our village was in great turmoil after struggling against the middle peasant Zhao Rongx, and four middle peasant households wanted to hand over their land and lost the motivation to produce!" "In the past, there was no standard, it was just based on living conditions and squabbles! It's good to divide classes this way." During the discussion, it was also emphasized that this compensation was not a case of returning the original items unconditionally regardless of the circumstances, which also eased the unease of some of the masses who were afraid of returning property.

The second step: self-reporting and public discussion, democratic correction, and preliminary classification. Generally, the process is led by the People's Congress, with the farmers' association group as the main body, with the households that were struggled against making self-reports, followed by public discussion, and then democratic correction. The specific implementation varies slightly from district to district. For example, the Sixth District's Xiaqin Village's approach was for representatives to disperse to the streets, and use citizen groups to classify the households in each street that were struggled against, first self-reporting, then everyone discussing, and immediately sitting down with those who were discussed to be middle peasants. The discussion was very serious, and a person named Tianfu underreported six mu of land and was immediately exposed, and it was said: "You hired a long-term worker for three years, and there was other exploitation, and you also used short-term workers, and the total exploitation exceeds a quarter, so you are a rich peasant." When the masses master the standards, revising class designations becomes their own action. In the Third District, the households that were struggled against were also allowed to participate in the citizen groups, and landlords and rich peasants also understood the class division standards and policies, and were convinced. One rich peasant said: If I don't exploit in the future, I can change my class status as long as I work hard for another three years.

The third step: after careful classification, the People's Congress conducts a review, and the village congress formally approves it and submits it to the district government for approval.

In villages that have undergone such revision of class designations, a new atmosphere of unity and production prevails. Many villages actively planted wheat after revising the designations. The masses said: "In this way, everyone has the motivation, who would want to sit around!" Jia Migui, who was previously classified as a landlord, was happy after being reclassified as a rich peasant, saying: "In this way, my labor hasn't been in vain."

The vast majority of villages in the county generally followed the above steps, achieving considerable results. However, there are also a few villages that did not let the masses master the policies, with a few people taking over the work, and the style was simple. The thoughts of cadres and the masses were not resolved, and they began to classify; as a result, they could not act according to the policies. Some cadres even criticized the village cadres, saying: The superiors didn't ask you to struggle against the middle peasants! Scaring all the party members and cadres. Some cadres did not implement the policies correctly, but distorted the spirit of the policies to get through their thoughts. For example, when revising class designations in Taiyi and Qinggang Villages, they did not clearly explain the class division standards, but only asked: Is it better to have more enemies? Or fewer enemies? The cadres in Qinggang asked the masses, is it better to classify more landlords and rich peasants? Or fewer landlords and rich peasants? It seemed that the policies had no fixed standards, and the landlords and rich peasants could be classified more or less. What was particularly wrong was the random setting of standards. For example, Shenjiazhuang stipulated how much land a laborer could cultivate. In addition to the land that they could cultivate themselves, the income from the remaining land was called "feudal exploitation." But this is only an isolated phenomenon.

Two very important points in the entire process: first, correctly publicizing policies and explaining standards, and paying attention to educating cadres and the masses to act according to policy standards in every step; and second, fully promoting democracy, overcoming the opinions and actions of a few people taking over and private revenge, and not correcting one extreme by going to the other extreme for the sake of revision, but mobilizing the masses to implement the correct policies. This is what should be paid more attention to in future revisions of class designations.

　　长治结束土改中
  　是怎样改订成份的？
    在结束土改中，划清阶级改订成份，是一个重要环节。兹将长治第一批结束土改村关于改订成份问题的初步总结，介绍于下。供各地参考：
    长治各村在进行改订成份时，一般采取了以下三个步骤：
    第一步：酝酿准备阶段，主要进行宣传政策，讲解划阶级标准，说明各阶级定义和待遇，这一段实际解决两个问题：一是打破干部及部分群众对改订成份的抵抗情绪；二是通过讨论，使干部群众懂得政策，自己掌握标准。在具体作法上：先开支部会，讲解为什么要划阶级及定义、待遇，结合村中被斗过的户，进行试划。如二区南董村着重讲了三点：一、标准与精神，二、生产手段的占有，三、剥削分量与年限。在试划中，发现干部党员普遍存在抵抗思想，怕承认错误而找理由提高成份。如申家庄干部说某户是恶霸，某户是汉奸，反正是不愿改订。他们说：“过去咱又斗又打人家，现在又要去给人家说好话，咱弄不了！”有的睹气说：“就没一户斗对的？就都错啦？”“以前发动群众斗了，这会又错了，这样怎见人家哩？”总之，村干不敢检讨认错，怕把责任推到自己身上，因而抵抗改订成份。在群众方面，主要是怕退东西而不愿改订成份，这主要是新中农。这些人在提出改正错订成份时，思想有矛盾，明知人家是中农，又怕划成中农退东西，因此也不愿改订成份。
    对于这些问题的解决，首先是具体分清是非，分别责任，说明当时领导上没很好掌握政策，没讲明划阶级标准，错斗不能全由村干部负责。在领导上自我检讨中，同时启发村干知错改错，按政策改订成份，农民就能真正团结，把敌人孤立出来；如不改订，把朋友划到敌人阵营，农民也不敢生产发家，内部就会混乱不安。接着结合村中情况，研究改订成份的重要性。下秦村反映：“俺村过去斗了中农赵荣×，村上情况就大乱，四户中农找着要献地，都没劲生产啦！”“过去就没个准，就是看生活、看圪堆斗争哩！这样划阶级可好啦。”在讨论中并着重说明了这次补偿，不是不分情况一律原物退还，也安定了部分群众怕退东西的不安情绪。
    第二步：自报公议、民主订正、进行初划。进行中一般是由人代会领导，以农会小组为主，被斗户自报，经过公议，再进行民主订正。各区在具体进行中略有出入，如六区下秦村的做法是代表分散到街，以公民小组划各街被斗户，先自报，大家讨论，讨论出是中农的，马上坐到一块去。讨论中表现很认真，有个叫天福的，少报了六亩地，马上被揭发出来，并说：“你雇了三年长工，还有别的剥削，还用短工，合起来剥削超过四分之一，是个富农。”群众掌握了标准，改订成份就成为群众自己的行动。三区在公民小组里，让被斗户也参加，地主、富农了解了划阶级标准与政策，也心服。有个富农说：今后不剥削，只要再好好劳动三年就能变成份了。
    第三步：仔细划过一遍后，人代会进行审查，村民大会正式通过，交区政府批准。
    凡是经过这样改订成份的村庄，村里就呈现一种团结生产的新气象，好多村在改订成份后，都积极种麦子。群众说：“这样就都有了劲了，谁还愿坐着哩！”贾米贵以前划的是地主，这次改订为富农后，他高兴地说：“这样，还没亏了我的劳动。”
    全县绝大部分村庄，一般都是经过如上步骤进行的，获得相当效果。但也有少数村，没让群众掌握政策，少数人包办，作风简单，干部群众思想没解决，就开始划；结果不能按政策行事。有的干部甚至指责村干说：上级也没叫你去斗争中农呀！把党员干部都吓住了。还有些干部，不以正确执行政策而是歪曲政策精神来打通思想，如太义、青岗村改订成份时，也不讲明划阶级标准，只提出：敌人多了好？少了好？青岗干部问群众，多划地富好？少划地富好？好象政策并无一定标准，地富可多划，可少划，尤其错误的是乱订标准，如申家庄规定一个劳力能种多少地，除了自己能种的地以外，下余土地的收入，都叫做“封建剥削”。但这只是极个别的现象。
    在整个过程中很重要的两点：一是正确宣传政策，讲解标准，在每个环节都注意教育干部群众按政策标准办事；二是充分发扬民主，克服少数人包办及私人报复的意见与行为，不是以偏纠偏为改订而改订，而是发动群众贯彻正确政策。这是在今后改订成份中应加注意的。
