　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, December 24th: TASS, Moscow, December 20th: Pravda published a report from its Paris correspondent Zhukov regarding the funeral of Communist Party member Hauriel, who was killed by the police for posting anti-war slogans. The report stated: "This simple worker, who sacrificed his life to defend peace and oppose war instigators, his funeral became an undeniable demonstration of the people of Paris. Despite the police arresting anyone posting funeral notices, tens of thousands of people marched towards the tall, grey building in the Toers area. The doors of this building were adorned with wide funeral ribbons decorated with silver, announcing Hauriel's funeral. The entire block was piled high with large wreaths of fresh flowers. The cold wind was biting, but no one noticed the cold. At 2:00 PM, a massive crowd of 150,000 people filled all the neighboring streets and squares, standing firm and unwavering, filled with anger and seriousness. There were workers, scientists, writers, and housewives; there were Communists, Catholics, and non-affiliated people. The Parisian working class solemnly swore before the ashes of their comrade-in-arms: they will continue to fight with unwavering effort for peace and against the instigators of new wars, for the independent freedom of France, and against attempts to turn France into a foreign colony. The funeral speeches by representatives of workers' groups were fierce and angry, resolutely expressing that they would continue the fight for peace and freedom despite the bloody terror. The funeral procession stretched for several kilometers. In the dim light of the early winter dusk, tens of thousands of people participating in the funeral procession passed through the Saint-Mondo Cemetery. Beside the hearse draped with the tricolor flag, representatives of the Communist Party and the French Trade Union, Hauriel's wife and children, stood in sorrow and awe-filled silence. The people of Paris raised their clenched fists, giving a final farewell to their fighting comrade."

　　在战友骨灰面前庄严宣誓
    坚决与战争贩子奋斗到底
    巴黎人民公葬豪列尔
    【新华社陕北二十四日电】塔斯社莫斯科二十日讯：真理报刊载该报记者朱可夫自巴黎报导因张贴反战标语而被警察杀害的共产党员豪列尔的葬仪称：这一为保卫和平、为反对战争鼓动者而献出了生命的质朴的工人，他的葬仪变成了巴黎人的不可轻侮的示威。尽管警察拘捕一切张贴葬仪通告的人，但仍有成千成万的人民向着托埃尔地方的高大灰色建筑物行进。这个建筑物的门上，装点着饰有银色的宣告豪列尔葬仪通告的宽幅葬礼饰带。整个一段街堆满了鲜花扎成的大花圈。寒风刺骨，但没有谁留意到天冷。下午两点钟，十五万人的巨大人海充塞了一切邻近的街道和方场，他们满怀愤怒，严肃而刚强地屹立着，一动也不动。这里有着工人、科学家、作家和家庭主妇；有着共产党人，天主教徒和无党无派的人们。巴黎工人阶级在他们战友的骨灰面前发出庄严誓言：他们将以决不动摇的努力继续为和平和反对新战争鼓动者而战斗，为法兰西的独立自由和反对把法国变成外国殖民地的企图而战斗。工人团体代表们的葬礼演说，激烈而愤怒，他们坚决表示将不顾血腥恐怖，而继续进行为和平与自由的战斗。葬礼的行列长达数公里。在初冬黄昏的微光中，成千累万参加葬礼行列的人们，穿过了圣蒙多墓地。在悬挂着三色旗的灵车旁边，共产党和法国职工会的代表，豪列尔的妻儿，在悲痛和竦然的沉默中站立着。巴黎人举起紧握的拳头，向他们的战斗的同志作了最后的告别。
