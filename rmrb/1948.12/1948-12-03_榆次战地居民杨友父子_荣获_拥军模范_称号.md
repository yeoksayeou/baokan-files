【Jinzhong Electric】Reporter Geng Xi reports: When our army entered the Dongshan defensive positions for permanent defense operations, the area was characterized by large mountains, small villages, poor people, and the exploitation by Yan’s bandits, making it extremely difficult to obtain vegetables and firewood. After a certain unit advanced to Hou’ao Village, northeast of Mengjiajing in Yuci County, the resident Yang You and his family voluntarily vacated a large cave dwelling with a heated kang for the troops, and supplied the troops with a large quantity of radishes and potatoes, with the Third Company alone purchasing 1,500 catties. They also sold all their grain straw to the troops to feed the livestock, and gave priority to the troops' use of all their furniture, saying, "Even if we don't eat or use it, the troops must eat and use it first." Our cadres and soldiers repeatedly declined, but he would not agree. Yang You is over fifty years old. When a certain reconnaissance team of ours set out to scout the terrain in the Xiaoyaotou area, Yang You, regardless of the difficulties and dangers, calmly and flexibly led the way for them, enabling the team to successfully complete their mission, capture four enemies alive, seize a machine gun, a small cannon, and a rifle, and obtain important information from the prisoners. On the way back to the camp, Yang You carried a rifle with a bayonet on his shoulder, escorting the prisoners, elated, and forgetting that he was an old man. His son, Yang Fuxi, was twenty-three years old. On the 27th, when the unit seized the main bunkers No. 13, 14, and 15, Fuxi voluntarily led the way for the Second Platoon of the Third Company, and carried ladders and hand grenades for the soldiers. On the night of the 17th, when we captured positions No. 13 and 14, the Second Platoon of the Third Company was tasked with defending position No. 13. The platoon leader advised Fuxi to go back, but he resolutely refused and entered the position with the troops. Around one o'clock in the morning, the enemy counterattacked us. The platoon leader told him to hide in a bomb shelter. Soon the bomb shelter was destroyed by enemy fire. He crawled out of the earth. The platoon leader asked him if he was afraid. He said, "I'm not afraid. Who doesn't know what the 'Second War Zone' is capable of? If we hit them a couple of times, they won't dare to come up." As he spoke, he transported hand grenades to the troops, pried open the boxes, used bullet heads to open the grenade caps, pulled out the fuses, and handed them to the soldiers to throw. But when he saw the soldiers throwing them, he couldn't help but throw them himself. Together with the troops, he defeated four enemy counterattacks. During the enemy's seventh counterattack, he was with the machine gunner Li Yi. The machine gun was damaged, and only four or five of them were left. Yang Fuxi threw grenades, while encouraging the troops, "It's okay, we've already fought to the edge of Taiyuan City, how much strength does he have left?" He threw three boxes of grenades in a row. The soldiers personally witnessed him killing or wounding seventy enemies. Everyone cheered, "Wow! This fellow villager deserves a merit." After the battle, the entire Third Company awarded Yang Fuxi a major merit, and submitted it to the regiment for approval. The regiment immediately agreed to approve it, and also recorded a minor merit for his father, Yang You. The Party Committee of the regiment has now written to the Yuci County Government and County Committee, requesting them to forward the meritorious service certificate of the troops, and suggesting that the County Government and County Committee give the Yang family father and son public praise in the newspaper, and give the Yang family the honorary title of "Model of Supporting the Army." Yang Fuxi has now become an unregistered soldier of the Third Company. As soon as he arrived, the quartermaster warmly took his hand and said, "Come on, let's go back to our company for dinner!"

　　榆次战地居民杨友父子
  　荣获“拥军模范”称号
    【晋中电】记者耿西报导：我军进入永久设防之东山阵地作战，该地山大村小人穷，又加以阎匪搜刮，蔬菜、柴草等均极感困难。某部进至榆次县属孟家井东北之后凹沟村，居民杨友全家即自动给部队誊出大窑暖炕，大量供给部队萝卜、山药蛋吃，仅三连一个单位即买到一千五百斤。又将全部谷草卖给部队喂牲口，一切家具均先尽着部队使用。并说：“那怕我们不吃不用，也得尽部队先吃先用。”我干部战士再三推辞，他都不答应。杨友年已五十余，我某侦察小组出发至小窑头一带侦察地形时，杨友不避艰险沉着机动，欣然为他们带路，并使该组顺利完成任务。活捉敌人四名，缴获机枪一挺、小炮一门、步枪一支，从俘虏口中取得了重要材料。回营途中，杨友肩扛带有刺刀之步枪押送俘虏，兴高彩烈，竟忘却他还是一个老汉。其子杨福喜年二十三岁，二十七日该部夺取十三、十四、十五号主碉时，福喜自动为三连二排带路，并为战士们扛梯子、背手榴弹。十七日夜，我攻占十三、十四号阵地，三连二排担任十三号阵地之防守任务时，二排长曾劝福喜回去，他坚决不走，随同部队进入了阵地，深夜一时许敌向我反扑，二排长叫他隐蔽在避弹坑里，不久避弹坑为敌炮火摧毁，他从土里钻出来，排长问他怕不怕，他说：“不怕，谁不知道‘二战区’那两下子，打他两下便不敢上来了。”他一边说，一边就给部队运手榴弹，撬开箱子，用子弹头顶开手榴弹盖，拉出线来交给战士们投掷。但他看见战士们投，不由得自己也跟着投起来。随同部队一起打垮了敌人四次反扑，敌人七次反扑时，他和机枪手李毅在一起，机枪打坏了，只剩下他们四五个人了，杨福喜投弹，一面给部队鼓励：“不要紧，咱们都打到太原城跟了，他还有多大劲？”一连打了三箱手榴弹，战士们亲眼看着他一个人便杀伤了七十个敌人，大家都齐声喝彩：“吓！这老乡非立功不行。”战斗结束后，三连全连给杨福喜评了一大功，呈请到团里批准，团马上同意批准了，并且给他父亲杨友也记了一小功。现该团党委会已写信给榆次县政府及县委会，请其转达部队的立功证，并建议该县府与县委会给杨家父子以登报表扬，给杨友全家以光荣的“拥军模范”称号。而杨福喜现已成为三连不记名的战士。他一来，事务长便亲热的拉着他的手说：“走，回咱们连上吃饭去！”
