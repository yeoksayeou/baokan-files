Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, December 28th. TASS Budapest: The unified Hungarian farmers' organization, the All-Hungarian Laboring Peasants and Agricultural Workers' League, held its inaugural congress here on the 20th. Hungarian President Szakasits, Prime Minister Dobi (Note: Former Prime Minister Dinnyés resigned on December 9th and was succeeded by Dobi, Chairman of the Smallholders Party), other government officials, General Secretary of the Working People's Party Rákosi, leaders of other parties in the coalition government, and leaders of trade unions and democratic groups all attended the inaugural congress. Prime Minister Dobi pointed out in his speech at the congress that Hungarian farmers have achieved significant results since the land reform. The government will spare no effort to guarantee a gradual improvement in the living standards of laboring peasants. Representatives of the Working People's Party, the National Peasant Party, and the Smallholders Party all congratulated the establishment of this new unified farmers' organization. Apro, General Secretary of the Trade Union Council, declared that the new organization can rely on the fighting solidarity and support of the Hungarian working class. The congress passed a resolution emphasizing that Hungarian agriculture has been restored due to the effective assistance of democratic countries, but the farming methods used in agriculture are still at a low level; this backwardness in the Hungarian countryside can only be eliminated through the establishment of cooperatives, and through planning and mechanization. The congress also adopted the organizational charter of the All-Hungarian Laboring Peasants and Agricultural Workers' League, and elected the central leading organ of the League.

　　建立统一农民组织
  　全匈农民联盟成立
    【新华社陕北二十八日电】塔斯社布达佩斯讯：匈牙利统一的农民组织——全匈劳动农民和农业工人联盟，于廿日在此间召开成立大会。匈总统斯查卡西兹、总理道比（按：前总理丁尼斯已于十二月九日辞职，由小农党主席道比继任）以下政府人员，劳动人民党总书记拉科西，联合政府其他各党的领袖以及职工会与民主团体的领袖，皆出席成立大会。总理道比在大会发言时指出：实行土地改革后，匈牙利农民已获得重大成果。政府将不遗余力地保证逐步提高劳动农民的生活水平。劳动人民党、国家农民党和小农党的代表，都祝贺这一新的统一的农民组织之成立。职工会理事会总书记阿普罗宣称：新的组织可以凭借匈牙利工人阶级的战斗的团结和支持。大会通过决议，着重指出：匈牙利农业曾由于民主国家的有效帮助而得到恢复，但农业方面所运用的耕作方法至今水平仍低；匈牙利农村的这一落后现象，只有经过建立合作社，经过计划化和机械化才能消除。大会又通过全匈劳动农民和农业工人联盟的组织章程，并选举了联盟的中央领导机关。
