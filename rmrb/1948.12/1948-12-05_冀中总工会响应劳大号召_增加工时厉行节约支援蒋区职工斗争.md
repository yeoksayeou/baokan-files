　　[Jizhong Electric] In response to the call of the Sixth National Labor Congress of China and to support the struggle of workers in the Chiang Kai-shek controlled areas, the Jizhong General Labor Union has called on all workers in the region to step up production, voluntarily increase working hours by half a day on public holidays, and practice thrift to create a fund to support the struggle of workers in the Chiang Kai-shek areas. To ensure the thorough implementation of this call, the Labor Union has instructed the labor unions of all counties, cities, and enterprises to conduct in-depth publicity and mobilization among cadres and members, to make them understand the great significance of supporting workers in the Chiang Kai-shek areas, and to achieve conscious donations. The donated funds should truly come from increased working hours and savings, preventing the phenomenon of simply raising money. In specific implementation, different methods should be determined according to the different nature of factories, workshops, and shops, and the different forms of wages.
    In other news: All employees of the Yonghua Match Company in Botou City have launched a relief movement to help unemployed workers in the Chiang Kai-shek areas and to offer condolences to the families of workers killed by Chiang Kai-shek bandits. On the 15th of this month, workers voluntarily worked a day of voluntary labor. The workers' enthusiasm for production was very high. Lao Cui and Lao Ai, two female workers in the packaging department, usually packaged more than 40 brands, but that day they packaged more than 60 brands. Wang Shuxiang and two others in the box material department did one-fifth more work than usual. Hu Dexin and six other outside workers also voluntarily requested to do a day of voluntary labor. According to statistics for that day, all employees contributed approximately 2,370 jin of wages in rice.

　　冀中总工会响应劳大号召
  　增加工时厉行节约支援蒋区职工斗争
    【冀中电】冀中总工会为响应中国第六次劳动大会号召，支援蒋管区职工斗争，特号召全区职工加紧生产，自动在公休日内增加半天工作时间，进行节约，作为支援蒋管区职工斗争的基金。该工会为使这一号召深入贯彻，特指示各县、市及企业工会，在干部、会员中进行深入的宣传动员，使其了解支援蒋管区职工的重大意义，做到自觉的捐助。所捐之款，应真是增加工时和节约所得，防止单纯募钱现象。在具体执行上，应根据工厂、作坊、店铺的不同性质与工资形式的不同情况，确定不同办法。
    又讯：泊头市永华火柴公司全体职工，为救济蒋区失业的工人，和慰问被蒋匪杀害的工人家属，特发起援济运动。本月十五日，工人们自动做义务工一天。工人生产情绪很高。包装处的女工老翠、老爱二人，平常包四十多牌，这天包六十多牌。盒料部王树祥等三人比平常多做五分之一的活。外工胡得新等六人，也自动要求做了一天义务工。据这天统计，全体职工约献出工资米二千三百七十斤。
