Xinhua News Agency, Kaifeng, 26th – Workers in the railway and postal and telecommunications sectors in Kaifeng are stepping up the restoration of transportation and telecommunications. In November, workers at the Kaifeng Longhai Railway Bureau’s locomotive section repaired 47 passenger and freight cars and over 1,000 various tools. The Highway Bureau’s engineering team has started repairing five major highway lines in the eastern Henan region since November 23rd. The construction area extends north to Kaifeng, south to Zhoujiakou, east to Yongcheng, and west to Xuchang. Postal workers have opened 1,200 li of postal routes in various counties in eastern Henan. When the telecommunications bureau’s engineering team was working in the Bo County area in mid-November, they originally planned to complete 200 li of line construction in seven days, but they completed it in just four days. They used a relay method, running and distributing the lines along the poles. At night, when they could not insert markers, they used lanterns to replace the poles and continued to erect the lines. The Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission's wiring team, braving the cold wind and rain, erected more than 100 li of electric lines and planted more than 1,200 electric poles in seven days. Workers at the private Pulin Electric Light Company completed the dismantling and repair of more than 1,300 meters of lines ahead of schedule on the 8th of this month. The workers in the company's machine room, due to their responsible fire watching and diligent coal handling, created a new record of using only 2.7 tons of coal per day for 18 hours of power generation. This record saves 2.4 tons of coal per day compared to the general standard.

Xinhua News Agency, Xuzhou, 27th – Postal and telecommunications services in Xuzhou have been mostly restored. All postal personnel reported to work within a few days after the liberation of the city. When mail collection and delivery began, many citizens came to inquire about the locations to which mail could be sent. According to statistics from two postal branches on the 8th and 9th of this month, a total of 450 letters and 103 registered letters were collected and sent. The Jinan Xinmin Bao and Shandong Dazhong Daily can reach Xuzhou in four or five days. The Telecommunications Bureau has mostly resumed work. As of the 12th, 469 people had reported for duty. The bureau's telephone team, from the 4th when they began work to the 9th, in addition to repairing more than 40 telephone lines for various units of the military control commission, also restored telephone service to more than 800 of the original 1,200 civilian telephone subscribers. The long-distance telephone line from Xuzhou to Su County was restored on the 14th.

In addition, the postal workers' unions of Kaifeng and Zhengzhou recently sent five representatives, including Wang Zaisong and Niu Tujun, to Xuzhou to express their condolences to the city's postal workers. Wang and others arrived in Xuzhou on the 12th of this month and were warmly welcomed by the staff of the Xuzhou postal and telecommunications departments. According to the representatives, the postal workers in Kaifeng and Zhengzhou are willing to strengthen ties with the postal workers in Xuzhou and learn from each other in the future. They said: "When Zhengzhou and Kaifeng were first liberated, some postal workers in the two places had some concerns. But with the help of the People's Government, they were quickly dispelled. Now, the postal workers in the two places are working happily, their lives are taken care of, and new postal workers' unions have been established. The Zhengzhou postal workers, due to their active pursuit of progress, have organized a study committee, bought many new books, and started studying. The representatives hope that the postal workers in Xuzhou, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, will serve the people's postal cause and quickly organize a new union that truly represents the interests of all postal workers.
