　　Korean Residents' Patriotic Actions Unreasonably Interfered with by Japanese Police
    【Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 18th】 Tokyo Dispatch: Japanese police barbarously interfere with and suppress the patriotic actions of Korean residents in Japan. On the morning of the 10th, 1,200 Korean residents held a mass rally in a city near Shimonoseki, Japan, to "Protect the Rights of Koreans." When the flag of the Korean Democratic People's Republic was raised at the meeting, it was unreasonably interfered with by the Japanese police, causing a fight on the spot, and several Korean residents were injured. According to an Agence France-Presse dispatch from Tokyo on the 11th, Japanese police have recently interfered with similar incidents many times. Another dispatch: More than 40 members of the reactionary "Korean Residents' Independence Promotion League," with the connivance of the Japanese authorities, attacked the Himeji Prefecture branch of the progressive "Korean Residents' League" on the 10th, stabbing one of its members to death and injuring many others.
