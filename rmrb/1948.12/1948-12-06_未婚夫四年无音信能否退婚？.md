Can a Marriage Engagement Be Annulled After Four Years Without News From a Fiancé?

　　Question: I am an unmarried woman, 22 years old this year. In November of the 33rd year of the Republic of China (1944), my mother arranged a marriage engagement for me with Qi Bingbing from Donghuang Village. Qi is now 29 years old. Three months before the engagement, he joined the People's Liberation Army and served as a guard in the military sub-district command. He returned once for the engagement and soon left again. There was a letter back that year, but for the past four years, there has been no news. I went to the matchmaker, Qi Bingwen, to discuss this matter, but he was unwilling to take responsibility. Last November, I went to the district and county levels to resolve this. Comrade Zhang, who is in charge of civil affairs in the district, said, "You have to wait even ten or eight years." This July, I went to the county again, and the comrade in charge of civil affairs said, "I dare not make a decision on this matter for you." Now, the county and district cadres are unwilling to take responsibility and are adopting a delaying attitude. Please tell me, according to government laws, how many years without news from a fiancé at the front are required before a divorce is allowed? What procedures are required? Please reply and ask the Jianping County and the First District government to actively help me resolve this.

　　Answer: According to the "Decision on Amending Article 16 of the Marriage Regulations" promulgated by the former Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region Administrative Committee in December of the 36th year of the Republic of China (1947), Item 1, Item 3, and Item 6 state that for soldiers who joined the army in this border region during the Anti-Japanese War, if his fiancée has not received any news from him for three years since the last time she received news from him, she can file a divorce lawsuit. After receiving the request from the soldier's fiancée to dissolve the marriage contract, the court will investigate and verify the facts, wait another six months, and if there is still no news after inquiries from all parties, it can rule to dissolve the marriage contract. According to legal custom, the old law remains valid until the new law is promulgated. Thus, your fiancé, Qi Bingbing, had one letter in the 33rd year of the Republic of China (1944) and then disappeared without a trace. In November of the 36th year of the Republic of China (1947) (exactly three years later), you filed a divorce lawsuit with the district and county governments. Now, more than a year has passed, and if there is still no news, the marriage contract can be dissolved according to law. The county government should approve it immediately after investigating and finding no other circumstances.

　　未婚夫四年无音信能否退婚？
    问：我是一未婚女子，今年二十二岁，民国三十三年十一月由母亲作主和东黄＠村齐兵兵订婚，齐今年已二十九岁，订婚前三个月即参加解放军，在军分区司令部任警卫员，订婚时回来一次，不久即又出去，当年曾有信回来，此后四年于兹迄无音信，我曾去找媒人齐兵文讨论此事，他不敢负责；去年十一月，我到区上县上解决，区上管民政的张同志说：“十年八年也要你等”。今年七月我又到县上，管民政的同志说：“此事不敢给你作主。”现在县区干部对此都不敢负责，抱着拖的态度。请问：按政府法令，未婚夫在前方几年无音信的才允许退婚？要经什么手续？请答复，并转请建屏县及一区政府积极代我解决。
    （建屏一区西黄＠村　焦竹林）
    答：根据前晋察冀边区行政委员会三十六年十二月颁布的“修改婚姻条例第十六条的决定”第一项第三项第六项的规定，凡在抗日期间在本边区参军的军人，他的未婚妻从最后一次接到他的音信算起，已过三年未再接到他的音信的，可以提起离婚的诉讼，法院接到该军人未婚妻解除婚约的请求，调查属实后，再等半年，经各方打听仍无音信，可以判决解除婚约。依法律习惯，新法未颁布前旧法仍然有效。这样，你的未婚夫齐兵兵于三十三年有过一次信后就杳无音信，三十六年十一月（恰及三年后）你已到区、县政府提起离婚诉讼，到现在又经一年有余，如果仍无音信，依法可以解除婚约，县政府经过调查无其他情况时，应即予批准。
