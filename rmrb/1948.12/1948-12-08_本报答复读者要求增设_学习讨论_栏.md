This Newspaper Responds to Readers' Requests to Add a "Study and Discussion" Column

Comrade Geng Zixian wrote: "The People's Daily editorial on October 26 pointed out that testing is a good method to promote cadre learning, which is very correct. However, it is not an easy task to conduct cadre tests correctly and in a timely manner. Because the test questions must be very appropriate, and in many agencies and troops, the responsible persons may not have sufficient time and ability to carry out this matter. Therefore, I suggest to you: (1) Open a special column in the newspaper every day to publish five or ten test questions. The answers will be disclosed in the newspaper the day after tomorrow. In this way, when cadres read the newspaper every day, they can use the test questions to judge their learning progress, which is of great help to the learning of general cadres. (2) If it is not easy to publish a test question in the newspaper every day, it can be changed to publish it in the newspaper every Sunday, and the answers will be disclosed the following Sunday, which has the same effect. In order to help improve the political and cultural level of general working cadres, I hope you can accept this proposal and implement it immediately."

Helping cadres improve their political and cultural level is the bounden duty of the Party newspaper. The decision of the North China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the education of on-the-job cadres has pointed out: "Party newspapers and periodicals should be used as important tools for cadre learning, and the learning situation in various places, personal learning experiences, study notes, and research and discussion on theoretical issues should be published regularly and systematically in the newspapers." Following this instruction, this newspaper is willing to serve the readers in various places with the greatest effort. We agree very much with Comrade Geng Zixian's opinion. In the future, the fourth page of this newspaper will provide sufficient space for readers to conduct study and discussion. In order to make the questions raised more in line with everyone's thoughts and requirements, in order to better exert and exercise everyone's thinking ability and encourage learning enthusiasm, we require: From now on, everyone will raise questions on the fourth page of this newspaper, and everyone will answer them; everyone will discuss them; we hope that all cadres will use the newspaper as a learning tool, as a training ground for sharpening ideological weapons, and all difficult problems in the documents on study and the readings designated in the decision of the North China Bureau on on-the-job cadre study, or related ideological problems and specific problems, are welcome to be sent for publication and to start a wide-ranging discussion. At certain stages, the newspaper will invite the General Study Committee, the Propaganda Department of the Central Bureau, or hire experts to answer or make summaries. Once everyone's answers and discussion manuscripts are published in this newspaper, this newspaper will pay royalties.

In addition, personal learning experiences, study notes, research on special issues, various common sense, etc., all manuscripts that are helpful to everyone's learning are welcome to be submitted to this newspaper and will be published as much as possible. We also require the study committees in various places to pay attention to reflecting the learning situation in various places and summarizing learning experiences; the results of various tests and good papers can also be sent for publication.

At the same time, we received a letter from Comrade Zhang Qunying of Beijiasu Elementary School in Xingtang Fourth District, Beiyue: "I propose that in order to help comrades with low political and cultural levels to learn, a 'Little Dictionary' column should be opened in the People's Daily to explain difficult terms and solve readers' difficulties. For example, in the article 'One Thousand Americans' published in the People's Daily No. 133, if the terms such as trusts and Wall Street are not explained, readers will not understand them even if they read them... ."

Comrade Zhang Qunying's opinion is also very correct. This newspaper has begun to set up a "Reading Dictionary" column to explain the more difficult terms published in the newspaper on that day. In addition, we also plan to regularize the "Current Affairs Q&A" column that we had in the past. Because our information is very incomplete and the editors themselves know very limited, this column also hopes that everyone will ask and everyone will answer; readers' answers will be published and given royalties. Questions that are more difficult to answer will also be forwarded by this newspaper to experts for answers.

Everyone, send in your manuscripts enthusiastically, make full use of the Party newspaper, give play to the collective strength, and push our learning of theory, culture, policies, and current affairs forward!

### 本报答复读者要求增设“学习讨论”栏

专栏：

　　本报答复读者要求增设“学习讨论”栏
    耿子仙同志来信说：“十月二十六日人民日报专论指出测验是推动干部学习的良好方法，是非常对的。但要正确的适时的举行干部测验，不是一件容易的事。因为测验的题目必须十分适当，在许多机关与部队里，负责人未必都有充分时间和能力来进行这件事。因此我向你们建议：（一）每天在报上辟一专栏，发表测验题五个或十个。其答案则在隔一天报上披露。如此则干部每天读报时，即可拿测验题判断自己的学习进度。对于一般干部学习有很大的帮助。（二）要是每天在报上发表一次测验题不大容易，则可改为每逢星期日在报上发表一次，而于下一星期日披露答案，亦有同样的效果。为了帮助提高一般工作干部的政治及文化水平，我希望你们能接受这一提议，立即加以实行。”
    帮助干部提高政治文化水平，是党报应尽的责任。中共中央华北局关于在职干部教育的决定中已经指出：“党报党刊应做为干部学习的重要工具之一，经常地，有计划地在报上发表各地学习情况，个人学习心得，读书笔记与理论问题上研究讨论等。”遵循这一指示，本报愿以最大努力为各地读者学习服务。我们对耿子仙同志的意见是很同意的，今后本报第四版将以足够的篇幅供给读者进行学习讨论。为了使提出的问题更切合大家的思想与要求，为了更能发挥与锻炼大家的思考力，鼓励学习热情，我们要求：即今后本报第四版大家提问题，大家来答复；大家来讨论；希望全体干部都把报纸作为学习的工具，作为磨炼思想武器的练兵场，一切有关学习文件及华北局关于在职干部学习的决定中所指定的读物中的疑难问题或与之有关系的思想问题、具体问题，都希望踊跃寄来发表，并展开广泛的讨论。每到一定的段落，由报社提请总学委会、中央局宣传部或聘请专家解答或作总结。大家的答复和讨论的稿件，一经本报刊载，本报当发给稿费。
    另外，个人学习心得、读书笔记、专门问题研究，各种常识等，凡有助于大家学习的稿件，本报都欢迎投稿，并尽量刊载。我们还要求各地学委会经常注意反映各地学习情况，总结学习经验；各种测验的结果以及好的卷子，也可以寄来发表。
    同时，我们接到北岳行唐四区北贾素小学张群英同志来信说：“我提议为了帮助政治文化水准低的同志学习，应在人民日报上辟一个‘小辞典’栏，解释难懂名词，解决读者困难。如人民日报一三三号登载的‘美国一千人’一文中，其中什么托拉斯、华尔街等词，如不解释一下，读者看了不懂也是白闹。……。”
    张群英同志这个意见也是很对的。本报已开始设“读报辞典”一拦，解释当天报上所登的比较难懂的名词。此外，还拟把过去有了的“时事问答”一栏经常化起来。由于我们的资料很不完整，编辑同志自己所知也很有限，这一栏也希望大家问、大家答；读者答的，刊载后也给以稿费。比较难答的，也由本报转请专家解答。
    大家踊跃寄稿吧，充分地利用党报，发挥集体的力量，把我们的理论、文化、政策与时事的学习向前推进一步！
