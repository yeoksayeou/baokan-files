　　Party Members Take the Lead in Engaging in Sideline Occupations
  　Tree Palm Village Earns Thirteen Head of Cattle
    [This Newspaper's Report] After the land reform and party rectification in Shuzhang Village, Huguan, party members took the lead in developing winter production and achieved great results. Li Hongze, a party member, led a group of twelve people to cut yellow artemisia on the mountains to burn soda ash. They earned 200,000 Jichaos in five days and 120,000 Jichaos in fifteen days of transportation, buying a cow and ensuring that there would be no difficulties in the spring plowing for two years. They also plan to earn 800,000 Jichaos by the end of the year. Zhang Caifa's group, consisting of eight party members, earned 500,000 ocean dollars in twenty days through sideline transportation. The village originally planned to organize six small cooperatives and three oil mills, but now it has organized twelve small cooperatives, four oil mills, and one niter house. Forty-four male full laborers (accounting for half of the village's labor force), ten semi-laborers, and sixteen auxiliary laborers are participating in the twelve small cooperatives alone. In the twenty days from November 10th to December 1st, they earned a net profit of 2.4 million Jichaos, buying thirteen head of cattle. In addition, thirty-six old men were mobilized to collect manure. Some people get up before dawn every day to collect it. Some have already delivered the manure accumulated before autumn to the fields. It is planned that the village's winter production will earn 22.78 million Jichaos by the end of February next year. In addition to continuing to add livestock and farm implements, they also plan to repair and build houses. Because of the active leadership in production, party members and the masses have benefited, and party members have gained the support of the masses and their prestige among the masses is increasing day by day. The masses are vying to join the group led by party member Zhang Caifa. Villager Luo Zhong said, "The Communist Party members lead us to get rich through production, they are truly the long-term workers of the people." (Zhang Tusheng, Zhao Lijin)
