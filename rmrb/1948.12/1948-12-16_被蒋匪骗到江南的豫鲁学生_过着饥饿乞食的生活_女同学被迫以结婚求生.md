Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, December 11th: Henan and Shandong students who were coerced and deceived by the Kuomintang into fleeing to Kuomintang-controlled areas in Jiangnan are living extremely miserable and inhuman lives under the cruel abuse and persecution of the Kuomintang government. A student from Henan University sent a letter to the Kaifeng Daily on November 18th, complaining about the abuse and persecution suffered by them and their classmates after being deceived into going to Jiangnan. The letter stated: After the first liberation of Kaifeng in June, they and their classmates did not understand the people's democratic government's policy of caring for students. Deceived by the Kuomintang government's distorted propaganda, they risked artillery fire to go to the Kuomintang-controlled areas to study and find food. Upon arriving in Nanjing, they not only had no books to read, but also suffered from hunger and persecution. When they were so hungry that they could not bear it, they had to organize begging teams to beg on the streets. Some female students were even forced to marry as a way to survive. In late August, to protest the murder of two classmates by a shop owner who had once been an employee of Chennault's Air Transport Team, they marched to the puppet Presidential Palace to petition, but were beaten and kidnapped by large numbers of Kuomintang military police and secret agents on the way. The next morning, under the "escort" of armed military police, they were expelled from Nanjing. They were sent to Jurong, Wuxi, Jinhua, Quzhou, Qianshan and other places. In Qianshan, they lived in dilapidated temples, and when they were burning with hunger, they were forced to steal sweet potatoes and potatoes from the villagers to fill their stomachs. In Jurong and Jinhua, eight students have already died due to lack of medical treatment. In Wuxi, students fought each other for food, with four or five people injured on each side. Later, the two sides reconciled, hugged each other and wept bitterly, hating the Kuomintang reactionary government that had deceived them and plunged them into hunger.

Another report from Tianjin newspapers in November revealed that of the more than 2,700 Henan refugee students from Dalian Linzhong who were deceived into going to Qianshan, Jiangxi, more than 500 had contracted malaria and dysentery due to malnutrition and acclimatization, and many students had died due to lack of treatment. More than 300 students from the former Kaifeng High School and Girls' High School were deceived into going to Suzhou, but the problems of food and lodging could not be solved, and there was no way to talk about studying. The students from Linyi Middle School in Shandong, who had wandered to Wuhu, were living in the Wan Nong Association. Most of the students were wrapped in quilts all day long due to lack of winter clothes, and they could not even get enough thin porridge to eat. The Shandong students who were taken in at Haidai Middle School in Yixing, Jiangsu, drank two meals of sweet potato porridge every day. Driven by hunger, some students had no choice but to go to the streets to beg for food to get a full meal. A group of middle school students who were forcibly sent from Yantai to Shanghai at the end of October huddled under the corridors and eaves of the Shandong Guild Hall, eating only two meals of porridge a day. Many people were sick due to malnutrition.

　　被蒋匪骗到江南的豫鲁学生
  　过着饥饿乞食的生活
    女同学被迫以结婚求生
    【新华社陕北十一日电】受国民党胁迫欺骗流落江南国民党统治区的河南、山东学生，在国民党政府残酷虐待和迫害下，正过着极端悲惨的非人的生活。一位河南大学的学生十一月十八日投函开封日报控诉他们一群同学被骗到江南后遭受虐待迫害的情形称：六月开封第一次解放后，他们一群同学不了解人民民主政府的爱护学生的政策，受了国民党政府歪曲宣传的欺骗，冒着炮火想到国民党统治区找书读、找饭吃。到了南京，不但无书可读，而且备受饥饿与迫害。在大家饿得无法时，只好组织讨饭队，沿街乞讨。甚至有些女同学被迫以结婚当作求生出路。八月下旬他们为抗议两个同学横遭曾充陈纳德空运大队职员的商店老板用手枪打死，结队赴伪总统府请愿，途中竟遭国民党大批军警特务殴打绑架。翌晨在武装军警“护送”下，被逐出南京。他们被送到句容、无锡、金华、衢州、铅山等地。在铅山住在倾颓的破庙中，饿火中烧时，被迫偷食老乡的红薯、洋芋等充饥。在句容、金华的同学因缺乏医药治疗而病死的已有八人。在无锡的同学因争饭吃而互相殴打，双方各伤四、五人。后来双方和解，互相抱头痛哭，痛恨欺骗他们又陷他们于饥饿境地的国民党反动政府。
    另据十一月间天津报纸消息披露：被骗到江西铅山的大梁临中的两千七百余河南流亡学生，因营养不良及不服水土而患疟疾、痢疾的已达五百余人，不少学生已因得不到治疗而死去。原开封高中及女中两校学生三百余人被骗到苏州后，食宿问题均无法解决，根本谈不到读书。流浪至芜湖的原山东临沂中学学生，借住在湾＠农会里，大部分学生因缺乏寒衣而终日裹着棉被，连稀饭都吃不饱。被收容在江苏宜兴海岱中学的山东学生，每天喝两顿山芋米粥，在饥饿驱使下，有些学生只好上街行乞，以求一饱。十月底由烟台被强迫遣送到上海的一批中学生，瑟缩在山东会馆的走廊、屋檐下，每天只吃到两顿稀饭。因营养不良而生病的人极多。
