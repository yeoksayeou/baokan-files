　　The Old Woman Stands Up
　　Su Yun, Xie Zhixue, Liu Huaizun
　　As the sun was setting, the troops moved from afar to Chepuyaozi, east of Helinge'er, preparing to camp here.

　　The small village had only five families in total, with cave dwellings dug into the hillside. Company Commander Wang Youai walked along the narrow path towards the village, and from afar, he saw something white wriggling in front of a cave dwelling. Slowly, he made out that it was a person, and closer still, he recognized a woman in her forties. Company Commander Wang was puzzled, "Why is she crawling on the ground?" Immediately, a memory flashed through his mind: When the troops marched west in the spring, he had personally seen many women in this area without clothes to wear; this old woman must also be without pants: daring not to stand up and walk. So, he stopped and looked closely, confirming that his judgment was correct. This old woman was indeed only wearing a tattered white cloth shirt.

　　Company Commander Wang looked down at the empty cotton trousers he was wearing, turned around, and called to the cooking squad behind him: "Hey! Does anyone have pants? Quickly bring a pair to the old woman, look how pitiful she is!"

　　"I have some!" Deputy Squad Leader Zhang Fuyou immediately responded, sat down on the ground, took off his outer pair of single-layer military trousers, and handed them to the company commander. The company commander called out a child from the nearby cave dwelling and asked him to take the pants to the old woman. Only then did she stand up to welcome the troops into the house and boil water for them.

　　At the cave entrance were two naked children, huddled together, shivering from the cold. Quartermaster Zhang Shuren looked at them and took off his beloved short raincoat and put it on them. The two children each stuck an arm through a sleeve and jumped up and down with joy.

　　That evening, the company headquarters launched a small fundraising campaign. In addition to Zhang Fuyou and Zhang Shuren, who had given away their clothes during the day, Instructor Wang Yingcai, Deputy Company Commander Huo Cunde, Platoon Leader Hu Shui of the First Platoon, and Platoon Leader Wang Zhenting of the Second Platoon all donated clothes. Company Commander Wang Youai really had no clothes to spare, so he donated all the needles, thread, hemp for making shoes, and his beloved fine thread cloth wrapping he had brought from thousands of miles away to the landlord. Squad Leader Zhang Wenli of the Third Squad came to the company headquarters for a meeting and also took off his clothes. The next day, when the news spread to the squad, the soldiers were stirred up. Soldiers An Deren, Cheng Jingshan, Squad Leader Huo Yongxiang of the Fourth Squad, and Squad Leader Wang Chunlin of the Sixth Squad all took out clothes; in addition to clothes, Huo Yongxiang and Wang Chunlin also gave up smoking and donated their only five thousand yuan. When the troops were assembling, Huo Yongxiang noticed an old man standing barefoot nearby on the cold, frosty ground. His soles, hardened like tree bark from not wearing shoes for a long time, had many large cracks running across his toes and heels... Huo Yongxiang felt very sad upon seeing this and immediately took off his shoes and ran over to give them to the old man. Seeing that Yongxiang was barefoot himself but giving him the shoes, the old man's face was filled with both joy and sorrow. He refused to accept them, saying, "Comrade! Put them on quickly! I'm not afraid of being barefoot, but you can't walk barefoot." After Huo Yongxiang explained repeatedly that he had another pair, the old man finally accepted them.

　　Seeing that the landlord's family was eating wild yam flour paste every day, Instructor Wang made a suggestion to the soldiers: "Let's each eat a little less rice this afternoon and spare five jin of rice for the landlord's family so they can have a full meal. What do you all think?" The soldiers unanimously agreed; they even suggested, "Five jin of rice is too little! Let's not eat this afternoon and give them more." After the instructor explained that there were many families like this in Suiyuan under Fu Zuoyi's brutal exploitation, and that relying solely on their donations, even if they didn't eat every meal, wouldn't solve the problem. The fundamental solution was to eliminate Fu Zuoyi to completely liberate them. They had to march and fight every day, and they couldn't do that if they weren't full. Finally, everyone agreed to increase the amount by five jin, and about ten jin of millet in two bags were all given to the landlord.

　　In front of their own troops—their own relatives—how deep and clear were the people's love and hatred. The next day, when the troops were assembling, the old woman wearing military trousers ran out of the cave dwelling. She couldn't hold back any longer. Standing in front of the troops, she cried, wanting to pour out her long-suppressed hatred and bitterness to her own brothers.

　　"Let me tell you about the suffering my family has endured, brothers, listen and avenge the poor..." She began to recount the events one by one: "My three-year-old child, who could even talk a little, starved to death on June 19th... With great difficulty, we harvested a few斗 of grain from the fields, but Fu Zuoyi robbed it all, demanding two斗 for every one斗, regardless of whether you lived or died. After taking all the grain, the family had nothing to eat. We went to the fields to find some sweet herbs to eat. It was okay for the adults, but the child's throat was too narrow, and he couldn't swallow it. He forced it down, but then couldn't pass any stools. I wanted to breastfeed him, but I was too hungry to produce any milk. The child cried from hunger. The old man went to a neighboring village to beg, but didn't return. I wanted to borrow a handful of flour from the rich man in the front village to make some porridge for the child, but they wouldn't lend it to me. And so, the child starved to death in my arms; even as he was dying, his little mouth kept sucking, wanting to eat..." She cried and couldn't speak anymore. The soldiers all cried with her, and a young liberated soldier was already sobbing audibly. Everyone asked her to continue speaking: "In the years when the Japanese devils were here, they captured the old man to build blockhouses, forcing him to work like a young man. If he was too slow, they would beat him. How could he withstand that like a young man? He was beaten until he had sores as big as bowls on his back, and he couldn't get out of bed. The whole family depended on him to work, and if he couldn't get up, the land couldn't be cultivated. But when Fu Zuoyi came, he was even more fierce than the Japanese, still demanding grain, forcing us to mortgage the land, but it still wasn't enough. The door, windows, pots, bowls, ladles, and spoons were all taken away by the officials, and the family had no choice but to go out and beg for food. This spring, the Eighth Route Army came and told us poor people to go to the city to receive grain. I went and received eighty jin of rice, and the family moved back here and built this cave dwelling. We also planted a few acres of barren land. Who knew that after you left, Fu Zuoyi came again, saying that the old man had done work for the Eighth Route Army and was going to bury him alive. I took the child and knelt down to beg for mercy, and the villagers vouched for him. He was hung on the big poplar tree for two whole days before they released him. The twelve-year-old child was also captured to build fences. He was small and had nothing to eat, and if he couldn't move a big stone, they would whip him, whipping the child until he was covered in bruises. The old man worked for the rich man, but they didn't want him because he was too poor... Alas! At that time, it was impossible for the poor to live! We were just hoping that you would come back. If you had come a few days earlier, my three-year-old child wouldn't have died; if you hadn't come, our family of five wouldn't have made it through this winter—you must not leave again, quickly defeat Fu Zuoyi! Save our family, save the poor!..." The more the old woman spoke, the more heartbroken she became, and the more she cried, the more touched and tearful the soldiers became. The cadres helped the old woman to sit down to one side and told the soldiers to wipe away their tears. Instructor Wang walked to the front of the troop and said loudly to the soldiers: "Comrades! Did you hear that? This is the life of the people under Fu Zuoyi's rule! After hearing this, what are your thoughts? You can all speak." Before he finished speaking, Deputy Company Commander Huo Shoude jumped to the front of the troop and said with deep anger: "My family's suffering is the same as the old woman's. The only difference is that my brother almost didn't starve to death. This is all caused by the heinous reactionaries, Chiang Kai-shek and Fu Zuoyi. If we don't fight well, we will be letting down the old woman, our own relatives, and the people. This time, our company must ask the higher-ups to give us important tasks. I personally request to join the assault team. Wherever we are directed, we will fight; wherever we fight, we will stay; we will never complain or fear difficulties... Comrades! Winter is coming soon, look at the old woman and the children, they don't have any clothes to wear, but we have new cotton trousers and new cotton jackets on our bodies; what suffering is there? No amount of suffering can compare to this suffering." Following this, liberated soldiers Zhao Fuzhen, Li Chun, Ban Hongxun, and others competed to pour out their own sufferings, expressing their determination to avenge the old woman and not return home until Chiang and Fu bandits were defeated. Squad Leader Huo Yongxiang cried and said: "Seeing the old woman, I think of my mother. My family, like the old woman's family, is oppressed and exploited to the point of not being able to live. I will fight Chiang Kai-shek and Fu Zuoyi to the end, to avenge the poor people of the world!" Squad Leader Pei Jinghui of the Sixth Squad jumped up and swore to the entire company: We will not return until all of Suiyuan is liberated. Company Commander Wang Youai asked everyone to make great contributions in this battle. Finally, the instructor called on everyone to always remember the old woman's suffering, remember the suffering of all the people of Suiyuan, overcome difficulties, abide by discipline, firmly adhere to our class stand, fight to the end for the liberation of all of Suiyuan, answer the old woman's demands, and avenge the thousands upon thousands of old women!..."

　　The troops were about to depart, and the soldiers, with the fiery combat enthusiasm to annihilate Fu's bandits, repeatedly comforted the old woman: "Old woman, we are leaving, we will definitely avenge you, go back!" But the old woman's family was unwilling to part with them. In the cold morning wind, they saw them off all the way to the foot of the hill, repeatedly exhorting: "Be sure to come into our home when you return." The troops marched far away, and the soldiers could still see many faint figures standing on the hillside when they looked back.

　　老大娘站起来了
    苏蕴、谢志学、刘怀尊
    太阳落山的时候，队伍从远方转移到和林格尔以东的车铺窑子，准备在这里宿营。
    小山庄上满共不过五家人家，窑洞挖在半山腰里。连长王友爱同志沿着羊肠小道往庄上走去，远远望见一家窑洞前，有一个白色的东西在蠕动，慢慢看出是一个人，更近些认清是一个四十多岁的妇女。王连长纳着闷，“为什么在地上爬呢？”立刻一个回忆从他的头脑里闪过：春天部队西征时，亲眼看见这一带许多妇女没有衣服穿；这位大娘也一定是没裤子穿：不敢立起来走。于是他站定了，再仔细一看，证明他的判断是正确的。这位大娘身上，确实只披着一条破白布单褂子。
    王连长低头看看自己身上那条空心棉裤，转过身来招呼跟在后面的炊事班：“喂！谁有裤子，赶快拿一条给老大娘送去，你们看多可怜呀！”
    “我有”副班长张福有立刻应声坐在地下，把外面那条单军裤脱下来，递给连长。连长到旁边窑洞里叫出一个小孩，叫他把裤子给大娘送去。她这才站起来，招呼队伍进房子，烧水喝。
    窑门口还有两个光屁股的孩子，死挤在一起，冻得直打战。司务长张树仁同志看了看，就把自己一件心爱的短雨衣脱下来，替他们穿上，两个孩子一人伸上一只袖筒，乐的站起来直跳。
    当天晚上，连部发起了一个小型募捐运动。除张福有、张树仁两个同志，白天拿出衣服以外，指导员王英才、副连长霍存德、一排长胡水、二排长汪振廷都捐出了衣服。连长王友爱实在拿不出衣服来，就把自己从千里外带来的针线和预备缝鞋的几两麻，还有自己心爱的细线包袱皮，全数捐助了房东。三班长张文立到连部来开会赶上了，也脱下了衣服。第二天消息传到班里，战士们哄动起来，战士安德仁、程景山，四班长霍永祥，六班长王春林都拿出衣服；霍永祥、王春林除衣服以外，自己烟也不吸了，把仅有的五千块钱也捐了出来。队伍集合时，霍永祥一眼看到近旁一位老大伯，赤着脚站在下过霜的冰冷的地上，长久没穿鞋的脚板子，磨成树皮一样，脚趾头和脚后跟横三竖四地裂成许多大口子……霍永祥一见心里好难过，立刻把自己脚上的鞋子脱下来，跑过去送给老大伯。老大伯见永祥自己光着脚，却把鞋子给他送来，老脸上又高兴、又悲伤，不肯接受说：“同志！你快穿上吧！我光着不怕，你光着脚不能走路。”经过霍永祥再三解释说自己还有一双，老大伯这才收下了。
    王指导员见到房东一家老小成天吃山药蛋糠糊糊，向战士们提了个意见：“咱们今天下午一人少吃一点饭，匀出五斤米给房东，让他们一家子吃顿饱饭，大家考虑一下是不是可以？”战士们异口同声的赞成；还提出：“五斤米太少了！下午咱们不吃饭了，多给他们一点吧”。经过指导员解释：在傅作义残暴榨取下，绥远象这样的不只一家两家，光靠我们捐助，顿顿不吃也解决不了问题，根本办法是消灭了傅作义才能彻底解放他们。咱们天天要行军打仗，吃不饱不行。最后全体通过增加五斤米，把两袋子小米约十来斤全送给了房东。
    在自己的部队——自己的亲人面前，群众的爱和恨是多么深切显明呵。第二天，队伍集合的时候，那位穿着军装裤子的老大娘跑出窑洞来，她再也捺不住了，站在队伍面前，她哭着，她要把她过去重重积压在心里的仇恨和苦水，向自己的子弟兵倾诉。
    “说一说我一家子受的苦，弟兄们听听，替穷人报仇………”她开始一件件的诉起来：“我那三岁的娃娃，甚也会说啦，今年六月十九，硬硬的给饿死了……好容易地里打下几斗粮食，傅作义都抢去了，打一斗要二斗，不管你死活。把粮食全要光了，一家子没吃的，到地里寻点甜曲菜吃，大人吃了还好些，孩子嗓子细，咽不下去，强咽下去又拉不出屎来，想吃＠＠（即奶）我又饿的没有，孩子饿的直哭，老汉出外村讨要回不来，想和前村老财借一把面给孩子熬点糊糊吃，人家都不借。就这样孩子硬硬的饿死在娘怀里；临死，小嘴还噗哒哒哒要吃的。——”她哭得说不上话来了，战士们全陪着她哭了，一个小解放战士已经哭出了声。大家要求她继续说下去：“当年日本鬼子在时，把老汉捉去修炮楼，逼着和年青人一样干，做慢了就打，他那顶住年青人呵，打的脊梁上生着碗口大的疮，躺在炕上起不来。一家子指着他一个人干活，他起不来地就不能种了。可是傅作义来了，比日本人还凶，还是一样的要粮食，逼的把地都顶出去还不够；门子、窗户、锅碗、瓢、勺，都叫当事的抬走了，一家子只好出门讨饭吃。今年春天，八路军来了，叫咱穷人进城领粮食去，我去领回八十斤米，一家子才从别处搬回来打下这孔窑，剩下几亩烂梁地也种上了。谁知你们走后，傅作义又来了，说老汉给八路军办过事，抓去就要活埋。我拉上孩子跪下求情，乡亲们去保，在大杨树上吊了两整天才放出来。十二岁的娃娃也抓去修围子，人小、没吃的，搬不动大石头就拿皮鞭子抽，抽的孩子浑身青。老汉给老财做工，人家不要，嫌咱穷……唉！那时候穷人真没法活呀！就盼着你们回来。你们早来几天，我那三岁娃娃也死不了；你们不来，我们一家五口今冬就过不去——你们可不要走啦，快点打败傅作义吧！救救我们一家，救救穷人们！………”老大娘越讲越伤心，越哭，战士们也越听越感动越哭。干部们把大娘扶到一边坐下，叫战士擦干了眼泪，王指导员走到队前，大声对战士们说：“同志们！听见了吧？这就是傅作义统治下老百姓的生活呀！大家听过后，有什么感想，可以说一说。”话音未落，副连长霍守德同志首先跳到队伍前面，痛愤地说：“我家和大娘家的苦是一样的，若说不一样的地方，就是我兄弟差一点没饿死，这都是蒋介石、傅作义万恶的反动派闹的。咱要不好好打仗，对不起大娘对不起自己的亲人，对不起老百姓，这回咱连一定要求上级给重要任务，我个人要求参加突击队，指到那里，打到哪里；打到哪里，钉到哪里；绝不叫苦，不怕困难。……同志们！现在冬天快到了，看看老大娘和孩子们都还没衣裳穿，可是我们新棉裤新棉袄全上身了；还有什么苦？多苦也跟不上这个苦呀。”接着解放战士赵福珍、李春、班洪勋等同志争着倾诉自己的苦处，表示决心为大娘报仇，不打垮蒋傅匪誓不回家。四班长霍永祥哭着说：“看见老大娘就想起我母亲，我家和大娘家一样受压迫剥削的不能活。我和蒋介石傅作义拼到底，为天下穷人报仇！”六班长裴景惠跳起来对全连宣誓：不解放全绥远不回去。连长王友爱同志要求大家在这次战斗里立大功。最后指导员号召时刻记住大娘的苦，记住全绥远人民的苦，克服困难，遵守纪律，坚定阶级立场，为解放全绥远战斗到底，答复大娘的要求，替千千万万的大娘报仇！………
    队伍要出发了，战士们带着誓歼傅匪的火炽般的战斗热情，几次安慰大娘：“老大娘，我们走了，一定替你报仇，回去吧！”可是大娘一家子那里肯舍。在早晨的冷风里，一直送到山坡下，再三嘱告说：“再回来一定要进家来呀。”队伍走出老远，战士们回头还望得见站在山坡上许多隐约的身影。
