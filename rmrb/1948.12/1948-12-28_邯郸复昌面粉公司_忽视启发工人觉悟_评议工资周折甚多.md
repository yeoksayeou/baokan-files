　　邯郸 Fuchang Flour Company
  　Neglects to Inspire Workers' Awareness
  　Wage Evaluation Encounters Many Twists and Turns
    Editor's Note: Although Fuchang Company's wage evaluation achieved some results in the end, it was generally not very successful. We believe the reason for this is the lack of in-depth ideological education during the wage evaluation process, failing to raise workers' class consciousness based on their own experiences; instead, a disguised coercive method such as a "shock team" was adopted. Even in the final actual accounting, it only involved immediate interests and did not further improve the workers. We hope that all regions will use all effective means to strengthen the class and policy education of workers in implementing the resolutions of the Industry and Commerce Conference, truly enhance workers' awareness, and reasonably assess wages to achieve the goal of developing production.
    [Jinan News] After the public-owned Handan Fuchang Flour Company started operations in July this year, it was soon discovered that the wage system was not reasonably defined. Some veteran technicians who had gone out with the factory for war preparedness did not earn as much as the new workers who were called back from their homes after the start of operations. Some of the new workers who came from other factories, due to a lack of understanding of their skills, had low wages despite being highly skilled, while those with lower skills had wages that were not low. For example, Ma Zhenqing, a team leader in the milling department, earned only 130 jin of grain, while Wang Zhentang, an oiler on the third floor, earned 170 jin; also, Li Deshan and Shi Chengyin, boiler workers, had relatively high skills in burning water and could repair water pipes, earning only 195 jin, while Chen Kelin, who was less skilled than them, earned 210 jin. In short, there were significant problems with the wage system, and workers with lower wages had complaints. Because the factory could not determine the wages at that time, it had to declare that the current wages were not yet final and decided to give the workers a temporary loan of 96 jin of grain per month, with adjustments to be made after the evaluation. This stabilized the workers' emotions to some extent.
    After the North China Industry and Commerce Conference in August, the factory began to study the wage issue, believing that the main problems in the implementation of the current wage policy were neglecting technology, committing the mistake of egalitarianism, and having wages that were too high, affecting the factory's development. Therefore, it began to find ways to solve the wage problem.
    The first time, the factory divided wages into three grades and nine levels. After everyone discussed it, a evaluation committee was formed from workers and staff to conduct the evaluation. However, because the factory did not clearly propose the amount of grain for each level in advance, nor did it explain why wages were being reduced, everyone's thinking was not aligned, and they all disagreed with the wage evaluation. Some workers even regarded the factory as a capitalist, forming a confrontational relationship. The factory therefore changed its approach and selected a three-person standing committee from the evaluation committee to evaluate a number first. However, because the three members of the standing committee did not understand the meaning of the wage evaluation, were afraid of offending people, and also had egalitarian ideas themselves, they did not seriously compare skills during the evaluation, turning it into comparing people, grain, and working hours. As a result, wages were evaluated even higher, and the wages of general apprentices and oilers were still evaluated to be about the same as those of skilled workers, causing the evaluation to be a complete failure.
    After reviewing the failure of the last evaluation, the factory absorbed the trade union to participate in the leadership and conducted a third evaluation, proposing to determine the level of wages based on the quality of technology and differentiating between light and heavy industries. The steps were to first determine the wages of technicians to stabilize their emotions, in order to promote all the workers in the factory. However, the factory leaders still failed to convince everyone from the perspective of developing industry and benefiting everyone. The evaluation committee members and several technicians still had concerns in their minds, harboring a view of bestowing favors and providing relief, fearing that the wages would be evaluated too low, fearing that they would be at a disadvantage compared to others, and fearing being scolded. They observed each other and did not express opinions during the evaluation. As a result, most of the evaluations were still too high, and some ordinary laborers earned the same wages as skilled workers in the grading process. The workers' minds had a kind of confrontational mood, seeing how the evaluation would go, working if it suited them, and leaving if it did not. After discovering these ideological obstacles, the leaders only criticized the evaluation committee without deeply resolving the issues of thought and understanding, so the evaluation committee also developed confrontation in their minds. After three or four consecutive evaluations, it was still unsuccessful.
    Finally, after further research, the leaders decided to break through the old circle and add new strength, deciding to form a wage evaluation shock team of three people, including Wu Wendong, with the task of breaking through sentimentality, launching debates, and conducting evaluations based on policies. It was decided to focus on the boiler room work, and according to the opinions of several masters in the evaluation committee, the six people in the boiler room were divided into four grades according to their technical level, and then the ＠ number and grade were evaluated. However, because the leaders did not clearly announce what the overall wages included in advance, everyone still did not understand the meaning of re-evaluating wages, so the shock team encountered great difficulties in carrying out its work. After discovering these problems, the leaders determined a standard for overall wages, explaining that worker expenses only included food, haircuts, and hiring a cook. In addition, four expenses such as heating, medical care, supper, and eating utensils could be submitted to the Industrial Department for resolution. They also used the wages of two technical workers as examples to give everyone a specific account, explaining that the wages of skilled workers had not decreased compared to the past. On the other hand, a representative of the municipal trade union introduced the wage situation in the city at the conference, stating that workers in private factories in Handan worked longer hours than in this factory, but their wages were not higher than those in this factory. In this way, the workers' emotions gradually stabilized, shifting from confrontation to consideration and agreement. Some workers who understood the thinking even voluntarily requested to lower their wage grades. For example, Mi Diankui, a wire drawing worker in the repair department, initially had no understanding, but now he is performing very well. He was initially rated as Grade 3 of the first class, earning 85 ＠, and then rated as Grade 1 of the second class. Finally, he stated that his technology was not high, and he would rather be in Grade 2 of the second class, earning 72 ＠. Workers Jia Zhaolin and others also resolved their ideological knots and voluntarily declared to reduce their wages.

　　邯郸复昌面粉公司
  　忽视启发工人觉悟
  　评议工资周折甚多
    编者按：复昌公司这次评议工资，虽然最后也获得了一些成绩，但总的说来是不够成功的。其原因，我们认为是评工资中缺乏深入的思想教育，没有根据工人自己的经验来提高其阶级觉悟；只是采用了“突击小组”之类的变相强制办法。即使在最后的实际算帐中，也仅仅涉及眼前利益，而未更进一步提高工人。我们希望各地在执行工商会议决议中，用一切有效办法来加强对工人的阶级的、政策的教育，真正提高工人的自觉，合理评订工资，以达发展生产之目的。
    【冀南讯】邯郸市公营复昌面粉公司，今年七月开工以后不久，发现工资制度规定得不合理。有些跟着工厂备战出去的老技术工人，倒没有开工后新从家叫回来的工人工资多。一部分从别的工厂新来的工人，因不了解他们的技术，有的技术高，工资定得太低，技术低的，工资反而不低。如制粉部带班技术工人马振清，只挣一百三十斤，王振堂是个三层楼上的加油工人，却挣一百七十斤；又如炉房工人李德善、石成银烧水技术较高，又会修理水管，只挣一百九十五斤，陈克林在技术上比他俩都差，却挣二百一十斤。总之，工资制度存在着很大问题，工资低了的工人都有意见。厂方因当时对工资无法确定，只好声明目前工资暂不为准，决定每月先给工人暂借九十六斤粮食，将来评订后再长退短补。这样工人情绪才较为稳定。
    八月华北工商会议后，厂方开始研究工资问题，认为目前工资政策执行中的主要问题，是忽视技术，犯了平均主义的毛病及工资过高，影响了工厂发展。于是开始设法解决工资问题。
    第一次是由厂方将工资划为三等九级，经大家酝酿，从工人职员中成立评委会，进行评议。但由于厂方事先没有明确提出每级米数，为什么减资也未解释清楚，所以大家思想不通，都不同意评资。甚至有一部分工人把厂方看成资本家，形成对立。厂方因此即改变办法，由评委会选出三个人的常委会，让他们先评个数字。但因三个常委也不了解评工资意义，怕得罪人，自己也都有平均主义思想，所以评议中没有认真比较技术，变成比人、比米、比工作时间。结果工资更评高了，并依然把一般学徒、加油工人的工资评得和技术工人差不多，使评议完全失败。
    经过对上次评议失败的检讨，厂方吸收了职工会参加领导，又进行第三次评议，并提出根据技术好坏，分别轻重工业以评定工资的高低。步骤是先确定技师工资，安定他们的情绪，以推动全厂工人。但该厂领导上仍未能从发展工业，大家有利的道理上去说通大家，评议委员和几位技师思想上仍有顾虑，存在着恩赐救济观点，怕工资评议少了，一则工人不够费用，二则怕比较之下，自己吃了亏，三则怕挨骂，评议时互相观望，不发表意见。结果大部还是评议过高，在分等级中，有些普通劳动工人，与技术工人仍赚同样工资。工人思想上则存在一种对抗情绪，看看评议如何，合则干，不合就散。领导上发现这些思想障碍后，仍然只是对评委会提出批评指斥，而没有深入去解决思想与认识问题，所以评委会思想上也产生了对抗。连续评议三、四次，还是没有成功。
    最后领导上又经过研究，决定突破旧圈子，增加新力量，决定吴文东等三人组成评议突击小组，任务是打破情面，展开争论，根据政策进行评议。确定以炉房工作为重点，根据评委会几位师傅的意见，把炉房六个人，根据技术高低，分成四等，再评出＠数和等级。但因领导上事先对全面工资究竟包括些什么，没有向大家宣布清楚，大家对重评工资的意义仍不了解，所以突击小组进行工作非常困难。发现这些问题后，领导上又把全面工资确定了一个标准，说明工人开支只包括伙食、理发及雇伙夫，此外如烤火、医药、夜饭和吃饭用具等四项开支，可呈请工业处解决。又以两个技术工人的工资为例，给大家具体算帐，说明有技术的比过去工资并没有减少。另一方面，由市职工会代表在大会上介绍该市工资情况，说明邯市各私营工厂工人，劳动时间比本厂还长，但工资待遇却不比本厂高，这样工人情绪才稳定下去，由对抗慢慢转向考虑、同意。有些工人弄通了思想的，并自动要求把工资降低等级。如修理部拉丝工人米殿魁开始时思想一点不通，现在表现很好，初评他一等三级，挣八十五个＠，后又评为二等一级。最后他声明自己技术不高，宁愿在二等二级，挣七十二个＠。工人贾兆林等也解开了思想疙瘩，自动声明减低工资。
