　　Balkan States – The Balkans are one of the three major peninsulas in Southern Europe (the other two are the Italian Peninsula and the Iberian Peninsula), surrounded by the sea on three sides. Politically, they are divided into six countries: Yugoslavia, Romania, Bulgaria, Albania, Greece, and Turkey. These six countries are generally referred to as the Balkan States.
　　Poland's Three-Year Economic Recovery Plan – In order to recover from the wounds of war, vigorously develop domestic industry and agriculture, improve people's living standards, and lay a solid foundation for moving towards socialism after this war, Poland began implementing a three-year economic recovery plan in 1947. The main contents of this plan are: industrial production should exceed the pre-war level by two times, large-scale land reform should be implemented, 200,000 farmers should be relocated to the west to develop agricultural production, rye production should be doubled in two years, and wheat production should be increased by two and a half times, etc.
　　Century – A unit for calculating years in history, every hundred years is a century. The year of Jesus' birth is the beginning of the first century. This year is the 1,948th year after "Jesus' birth," which is the 50s of the twentieth century. The years before Jesus' birth are called BC, such as BC so and so year. Anno Domini (AD) refers to the first year of Jesus' birth.
　　Union of South Africa – One of Britain's self-governing dominions. Located in the southernmost part of Africa, it was formed in 1910 by the Cape of Good Hope, Natal, Transvaal, and the Orange Free State. It covers an area of 1,222,000 square kilometers and has a population of approximately 11 million. It produces grains, cotton, diamonds, and other metals. The government of the Union of South Africa is a notorious dictatorial government, exploiting the people's democratic freedoms, and the people's lives are very painful.
　　Outer Transylvania – Place name. Located at the border of Romania, Hungary, and Czechoslovakia in Europe. It covers an area of 133,000 square kilometers. This is a place where many ethnic groups live, including Hungarians, Jews, Romanians, etc. There have always been many ethnic disputes. After the First World War, Hungary ceded this area to Romania. When Hitler launched an aggression against Europe in 1940, in order to win over Hungary and dismember Romania's independence, he provoked a dispute between the two countries over Outer Transylvania. Finally, Hitler served as an "arbitrator" and had Romania cede a portion of Outer Transylvania—45,000 square kilometers—back to Hungary. Only after the establishment of the People's Democratic Republics of Hungary and Romania after this war, which eradicated the causes of ethnic discrimination and disputes, and all ethnic groups obtained equal social, political, and economic treatment, was this problem truly and rationally resolved.
　　Southern Dobruja – Place name. A small area at the border of Bulgaria and Romania, bordering the Black Sea, with a mixed population. In 1940, Hitler, in order to win over the then reactionary Bulgarian government, forced Romania to cede it to Bulgaria.
