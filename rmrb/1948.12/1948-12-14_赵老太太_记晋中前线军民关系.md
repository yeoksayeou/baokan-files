The bright red date orchards embrace a small village of fifty-odd households. The troops, withdrawn from the Jinzhong frontlines, are resting and studying here.

The third platoon of the seventh company is billeted with a family named Zhao on the mountainside. Granny Zhao is already fifty-four years old, leaning on a cane, never showing a smile, silently busying herself with housework all day. There's no one to help Granny Zhao at home. Her old man is somewhat disabled, and her brother is a busy village cadre, away from home all day long. Her child joined the army last year, and her daughter-in-law is very young, finding it difficult to fetch water and grind flour. Granny Zhao constantly thinks of her son, but she also understands that her child joined the army last March to seek revenge, to fight against Yan Xishan. Thinking back to the past, her child was twice seized by Yan Xishan, her home was untenable, and her belongings were looted by the enemy. Now she has a home and food and clothing, all thanks to the Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army. Once, Granny Zhao offered the comrades boiled corn, but they declined. She said, "Eat it, this stuff is all given to me by you. If you hadn't come, where would I have a home, where would I have these things?" But she still looked dispirited.

The troops arrived, filling the courtyard with lively young men, singing and studying, a vibrant and energetic new atmosphere. During their spare time, they cleaned the yard spotless, whitewashed the mud walls, and even wrote slogans about fighting and studying. The manure in the latrine was carried away, and the water vat was filled with water every day. Granny Zhao's family changed, and Granny Zhao's heart also changed.

One day, just as Granny Zhao and her daughter-in-law were grinding flour, the comrades returned from class. Before the sweat on their foreheads was dry, they jostled and vied to grind the flour, finishing it in no time. Granny Zhao and her daughter-in-law beamed with joy.

After a few days of living together, the troops became as close to Granny Zhao as family. Granny Zhao also transformed into a different person, becoming happier, talking more, discarding her cane, and walking more sprightly.

As usual, she boiled seven or eight pots of water every day. As soon as the comrades returned from class or gathering firewood, a steaming pot of hot water was waiting. Sometimes, she even brought the water to each squad for everyone to drink, saying, "You are too busy. You get up very early for drills, and after the drills, you have classes, and also meetings, writing, gathering firewood… Drink more hot water, get sick less, so you can fight the enemy, take Taiyuan, hey!"

On the fifteenth day of the eighth lunar month, she cut mooncakes and pears and offered them to everyone. The comrades refused. After everyone had gone to sleep, she quietly placed a handful of big red dates next to each person's head. Some comrades woke up and told her, "Granny, this is against the rules, we can't eat them!" She said, "Eat them, it's okay, I'm telling you to eat them. If the battalion commander criticizes you, I'll reason with him. It's the fifteenth of August, you're usually so tired, you can't even eat these little things, hey!" Granny Zhao always spoke with a kind smile on her face, ending her sentences with the interjection "hey."

Once, someone accidentally broke a thread that her daughter-in-law was spinning. Her daughter-in-law, being young, became anxious. Granny Zhao scolded her, "Before the Liberation Army came, we ran into the mountains. You were looking forward to the Liberation Army coming day and night. Now the Eighth Route Army comrades have come, we can stand on our own two feet and live a good life. Why are you throwing a tantrum again, really… hey!"

In many small ways, Granny Zhao took care of everyone as if they were her own sons. Every morning, before everyone got up, she swept the floor of the house. Granny Zhao said, "There are many fleas in the house! If it's not swept clean, the comrades won't sleep well at night and will be bitten during the day." As soon as the comrades got up, a pot of steaming hot water was ready for them to wash their faces.

The weather changed, and the wind picked up. Granny Zhao diligently pasted paper on all the windows of the house. One night it rained, and Granny Zhao gathered all the clothes in the yard. The next morning, she held a pile of folded clothes and shouted, "Comrades of the seventh and eighth squads, come and get what belongs to you!"

In the middle of the night, she checked on the comrades several times to see if they were sleeping well and if they were properly covered. Once, she saw that Comrade Shi Guanghua didn't have a pillow. "You've worked hard all day, you must sleep well at night," she said, and gave him her own pillow. Comrade Geng Sanjiang was sick for a few days, and Granny Zhao personally boiled water and took care of him, also covering him with a quilt, and then came to Comrade Geng with a jar and said, "You've caught a cold, cupping will make you feel better!" Comrade Chang Yukuo had a sore foot, and Granny Zhao took out her own pain-relieving plaster and personally applied it for him.

One early morning, Geng Sanjiang was about to leave on a trip when Granny Zhao saw that his coat was torn in the front. She quickly grabbed him, preventing him from leaving, and immediately took out needle and thread to sew it for him. While sewing, she solemnly, and with the tone of a mother seeing her son off on a journey, advised, "If you're thirsty on the road, bear with it a little, don't eat the villagers' dates. Be careful when leading the livestock."

The weather was gradually getting colder, and the crops in the fields needed to be harvested urgently. In response to the superior's call for the autumn harvest, all the comrades of the third platoon mobilized. Granny Zhao's millet, corn, and sorghum were quickly harvested, threshed, and shelled, and they also helped Granny Zhao haul manure and pick dates. The comrades regarded Granny Zhao as their own mother, working from dawn till dusk, doing whatever needed to be done, not minding the hardship at all. And Granny Zhao became even more concerned and caring for these adorable sons.

Every night, as soon as it got dark, Granny Zhao would give her worn sheepskin coat to the sentry to wear. Even though it was late, she was still boiling water and bringing it to the sentry (at her door), saying kindly, "It's cold, drink some hot water to ward off the chill!" Sometimes she would also bring hot water for everyone to wash their feet.

Cotton quilt covers were distributed, and Granny Zhao and her daughter-in-law got busy. The comrades didn't have thread, so she took out four or five liang of thread she had spun to make quilts for everyone. The quilts for the entire third platoon were all automatically quilted by her and her daughter-in-law, they wouldn't let anyone else do it.

On Sunday, everyone took off their clothes to prepare for washing, but Granny Zhao insisted on taking them to wash, saying, "You are too busy, you should rest on Sundays, I feel happy doing it." She also said, "The comrades are all equally good. Before, when the enemy was here, I was always anxious, paying public grain twice a year, and also being seized for soldiers and robbed of grain, there was no way to live. Now that you've come, the people can finally settle down. The comrades are all kind and friendly, and also help the people with production, and also fight the enemy, hey! You are too good, the squad leader is good, the deputy squad leader is also good, the brothers are all good, hey!"

During their rest and conversations, the comrades were also grateful to Granny Zhao. Once, the comrades said to her, "Granny, you are so good to the Liberation Army, we should publish a story about you in the newspaper." Granny Zhao said, "It's good to publish a story, we'll enjoy seeing it, and my child will be happy to know about it, hey!"

Sure enough, the regimental newspaper published the story. Everyone read it to her, and she seriously offered her opinion, saying, "It's good, but it doesn't have my name. My child won't know who this Granny Zhao is." After a pause, she continued, "My surname is Shi, my name is Gui Lai, Shi Gui Lai."

    赵老太太
    ——记晋中前线军民关系
    全体指战员
    鲜红累累的枣林，拥抱着一个五十多户的小村庄，队伍从晋中火线上下来，就在这里休整学习。
    七连三排住在山半坡上一家姓赵的人家，赵老太太已经五十四岁了，拄着一根拐杖，一天不见有个笑脸，一语不发地一直忙着家务。赵老太太家里没有人手，老汉有点残废，兄弟当村干部忙的终天不在家。孩子去年参军去了，儿媳年纪很小，吃水推面都很困难。老太太不时惦念着她的儿子，但她也很明白，孩子是为了报仇，为了打阎锡山去年三月才参了军的。想起过去的日子，孩子两次被阎锡山抓走，自己的家不能站，自己的东西被敌人抢光了；现在有了家，有了吃穿，这都是共产党解放军给的。老太太有一次让同志们吃煮玉茭，同志们推辞不吃，她说：“你们吃吧，这东西都是你们给我的，你们不来唠，我哪有家，哪有这些东西？”但她总还是没精打彩的。
    队伍来啦，满院子都是活蹦乱跳的年轻小伙子，歌唱、学习，紧张活泼的新气象。他们乘着空闲，把院子打扫得干干净净，土墙上用白土刷得挂白，还写上了战斗学习的标语；茅厕的粪也担完了，水缸里每天都是满满的水。赵老太太的家庭变了样，赵老太太的心里也变了样。
    一天正当赵老太太和她的儿媳推磨的时候，同志们下课回来了，大家头上汗都没干就你争我夺抢着去推磨，一会的功夫就推完了。把个老太太和她的儿媳，在一旁喜的眉开眼笑。
    队伍住了几天，就和老太太亲热的象一家人，赵老太太也变成另外一个人了，高兴起来，话也多了，拐杖不要了，走路也翘健起来。
    照例的，她每天都烧七八锅开水，同志们一下课回来或打柴回来，一满锅热气腾腾的开水就在等着，有时还把水端到各班去让大家喝，并且说：“你们太忙罗，很早起来就出操，出完操就上课，还要开会、写字、打柴……多喝点开水，少生病，好打敌人，拿下太原，嗨！”
    旧历八月十五，她把切好的月饼和梨送给大家吃，同志们不要。等到大家都睡了，她悄悄地在每人头跟前放上一捧又红又大的枣子，有的同志醒了，告诉她：“老太太，这是群众纪律，不能吃！”她说：“吃唠，没关系，这是我叫你们吃的，营长批评你们唠，我跟他说理去；八月十五嘛，你们平常又辛苦，就连这点东西都吃不得，嗨！”老太太每次说话，总是满脸慈祥的笑容，用“嗨”这个口头语来结束她的话。
    有一次不知是谁把她媳妇纺的线碰断了一根，她的媳妇年纪小就发了急。老太太就责备她：“解放军没来，咱跑到山里，你一天到晚眼巴巴盼着解放军来，八路同志们可来罗，咱也能站到家过好日子罗，你又耍脾气来，真是……嗨！”
    在许多小事情上，老太太对大家照顾得象对自己的亲儿子一样周到，每天早上大家还没有起床，她就把屋子里的地扫了，老太太说：“屋里圪蚤多哩！不扫干净，同志们夜里睡不好，白天还要跑到身上咬。”同志们一起床，一锅热气腾腾的热水在准备得好好的，等同志去洗脸。
    天气变了，刮起风，老太太很上劲地把家里的窗子都糊了；夜里下了雨，老太太把所有在院里的衣服都收起来，第二天早晨她抱着一堆折好的衣服大声喊：“七八班的同志都来，是谁的谁拿去！”
    半夜里，不知道几次的去看同志们睡好没有，盖好没有。有一次她看见石光华同志没有枕头，“辛苦一天啦，夜里可得睡好，”说着就把她自己的枕头拿来给他。耿三江同志病了几天，老太太亲自烧水端水照顾他，还给他盖上被子，又拿着一个罐子来对耿同志说：“你是受啦风啦，扳扳罐子就好罗！”常玉科同志脚痛，老太太拿出她自己的止痛膏药亲自给贴上。
    有一天清早，耿三江出差正预备走，老太太看见他前襟破了，就赶忙抓住不让他走，随即拿出针线来给他缝；一面缝一面郑重而带有母亲送儿出行的教诲口语说：“路上渴唠，要忍一点，可不要吃老乡的枣子。牵牲口也要小心。”
    天气渐渐的凉了，地里的庄稼急着要收回来。为了响应上级的秋收号召，三排全体同志都动员起来，赵老太太的谷子、玉茭、高粱很快的就被收割回来，打了场，剥了籽，并且还帮助老太太倒粪、打枣子。同志们把老太太看成和自己的母亲一样，赶早搭黑，见活就干，一点也不嫌累。而老太太也就更加关心和爱护这群可爱的儿子了。
    每天晚上天一黑，老太太就把她铺的那件破羊皮袄送给放哨的披上。天已不早了，她还在烧开水，端给放哨的同志喝（在她门口），并很亲切地说：“天凉了，喝点热开水压压寒气！”有时候她还端些热开水叫大家洗脚。
    棉被套发下来了，赵老太太和她的媳妇忙开了。同志们没有线，她把自己纺的四五两线拿来给大家絮被子，三排的被子全是她老人家和她的儿媳自动絮起来的，不让她装都不行。
    礼拜日大家脱了衣服准备去洗，老太太却抢着要拿去洗，并且说：“你们太忙啦，礼拜天该休息休息，我作了心里如意。”她还说：“同志们都是一样的好。以前敌人在，弄得心里七上八下的，一年起两回公粮，还要抓兵抢粮，没办法。这会儿，你们来啦，老百姓才安下家。同志们都是和和气气的，还要帮助老百姓生产，还要打敌人，嗨！你们太好啦，班长好、副班长也好、弟兄们都好，嗨！”
    同志们在休息谈笑中，也都感激着老太太。有一次同志们对她说：“老太太，你对解放军这样好，要给你登个报。”老太太就说：“登个报也好，给咱看看也喜欢喜欢，俺孩子知道唠也高兴高兴，嗨！”
    果然，团里的小报登出来了，大家念给她听，她郑重地提意见说：“好是好，就是没有我的名字，我孩他也不知道赵老太太是孰（谁）。”停了一会，她接着说：“我姓施，我叫桂来的，叫施桂来。”
