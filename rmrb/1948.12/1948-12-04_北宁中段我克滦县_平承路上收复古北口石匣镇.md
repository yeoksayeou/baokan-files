Xinhua News Agency, Hebei-Chahar-Rehe, 2nd. Luan County, an important town on the central section of the Beining Railway, and the new and old stations of Luan County were liberated on the 29th of last month. The defending enemy, the Third Battalion of the 648th Regiment of the 220th Division of the Chiang Kai-shek 87th Army, the 34th Regiment of the Fifth Security Regiment of the puppet Hebei Province, and the puppet associations of Luan County and Leting County, blew up the Luan River iron bridge five miles northeast of the city at 7:00 on the 29th and abandoned the city and fled south at 2:00 AM. The city and the station were immediately recovered by us. The democratic government also entered the city to work at 6:00 PM on the same day. Luan County was built in the Song Dynasty. The city wall is solid, three zhang high and more than five chi wide. The county seat controls the Beining Railway in the north (the old station is five li north of the city, and the new station is five li northwest of the city), borders the Luan River in the east and west, and controls the key points of land and water transportation, becoming a distribution center for goods. There are two Luan River iron bridges, with a total length of about five li, and the projects are very large. When the bandits and puppets abandoned the city and fled this time, they destroyed three bridge piers and collapsed five bridge spans.

Xinhua News Agency, Hebei-Chahar-Rehe, 2nd. On the 29th of last month, the People's Liberation Army recovered Gubeikou, an important stronghold on the Pingcheng Railway northeast of Beiping, and Shixia Town to its south. The defending enemy, the 63rd Division of Shi Jue's 13th Army, abandoned the city and fled south at 10:00 AM that morning.

    【新华社冀察热辽二日电】北宁路中段重镇滦县城及滦县新、老两车站，于上月二十九日解放。守敌蒋匪八十七军二二零师六四八团第三营及伪河北省保安第五团第三十四团，滦县、乐亭两县之伪伙会，二十九日七时将该城东北五里之滦河铁桥炸毁后，于上午二时弃城向南逃窜。该城及车站当即为我收复。民主政府亦于同日午后六时入城办公。按滦县城为宋代修筑，城墙坚固，高三丈、宽五尺余。县城北控北宁铁路（老车站在城北之五里、新车站在城西北五里），东西依临滦河，扼水陆交通之要冲，成为货物集散之地。滦河铁桥共有两座，全长约五里，工程均甚浩大。此次匪伪弃城逃窜时，炸毁桥座三处，炸塌桥梁五孔。
