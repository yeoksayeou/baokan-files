　　[Ji-Lu-Yu Electric Dispatch] Tongyi Iron Factory in Keng Lijia, Chengguan District, Qingfeng, with the support of government bank loans, has greatly manufactured farm tools and hand tools to meet the needs of the countryside, and its business has greatly developed. Technician Wei of the factory used to work in the Pingyi Boiler Factory in Xingtai. He returned home last year due to some reasons. This year, in the first month, he and the masses in the village brewed a plan to open an iron factory. After two months of preparation, it officially started on March 19. Its products include plows, plowshares, seed drill shovels, large and small cart axles, keys, large and small anvils for iron stoves, oil mirrors, as well as large and small wheels and toothed wheels for cotton gins, cotton bows, and noodle rolling machines, totaling more than 30 kinds. Because they are all necessary for agricultural and handicraft production, sales are very smooth, and production has expanded accordingly, from firing the furnace once every 20 days or so, producing 1,000 catties, to firing the furnace once every half month, producing 1,500 catties. The factory's capital is 3,700 yuan (new currency), plus furniture shares of 4,000 yuan and manpower shares of 10 people. In April, the government bank lent the factory 7,000 yuan at a low interest rate of 7%; in early November, it lent 37,500 yuan under the physical guarantee of not collecting goods for orders, that is, it ordered 250 plowshares from the factory, calculated at a physical monthly interest of 1%, and every 100 plowshares had an interest equivalent to the value of one plowshare. By the end of November, the factory had a total profit of 27,000 yuan in eight months. Because its production meets the needs of the countryside, the prospects for development are broad. The factory is now planning to expand its operations, but there is not much pig iron nearby, and it is still necessary to find ways to purchase it from other places. If state-owned trading organizations can provide assistance in raw materials, it will be able to develop even better.

　　同义工厂制造农具
    服务农村后营业大发展
    【冀鲁豫电】清丰城关区坑李家同义铁工厂，在政府银行贷款扶助下，面向农村需要，大为制造农具及手工工具，营业大发展。该厂魏技师原在邢台平议锅厂工作，去年因故回家，今年正月也与本村群众酝酿计划开设铁工厂，经两月的筹备，迄三月十九日正式开工。其产品计有犁铧、犁镜、耧铧、大小车串、车轴、键、铁炉用的大小砧子、油镜以及轧花车、弹花弓、轧面条机的大小车轮和牙轮等三十余种因皆为农业与手工业生产所必需，故销路甚畅，生产随之扩大，由二十多天开炉一次、出货一千斤增至半月开炉一次出货一千五百斤。该厂资金三千七百元（新币、下同），另有家具股四千元及十个人的人力股，政府银行于四月间曾以七分低利贷给该厂七千元；十一月初又以定货不收货的实物保本办法，贷给三万七千五百元，即定该厂犁铧二百五十张，以实物月利一分计算，每百张犁铧有出一张犁铧价值的利息。至十一月份结帐，该厂八个月来共红利二万七千元。因其生产符合农村需要，所以发展前途广大。现该厂正拟扩大经营，惟附近生铁不多，尚需设法向外路采购，如国营贸易机关在原料上能予以扶助，则更能很好发展。
