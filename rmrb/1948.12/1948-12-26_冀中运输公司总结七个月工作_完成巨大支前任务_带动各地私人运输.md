After the motor vehicle team implemented the systems of skills testing, work inspection, and trial work, the driving speed, frequency, and load capacity gradually increased. In August, there were 88 trips, with 2,073 passengers and 23,550 jin of cargo; in October, the number of trips increased to 123, with 2,939 passengers and 43,910 jin of cargo.
