　　In Yangmalou Village, Fifth District, Fuping, Northern Hebei, before the land reform, 80% of the 130+ households were tenant farmers, paying 200 dan of grain just in rent. The peasants relied on the produce of the hillside land for their income, and their lives were hard with low levels of literacy; after the land reform, the peasants were liberated, and their lives were better than before. Everyone is also very eager to study culture. After the autumn harvest, more than forty of the village's sixty-plus children enrolled in school. Now that things are quieter, more than twenty young adults in the village have organized themselves, pooling money to buy lamp oil and hiring a teacher to give them literacy and abacus lessons. Every evening after dinner, they go to school to study, and they all happily say, "We've turned ourselves around economically, and we must also improve culturally!"

　　阜平翻身农民自动成立夜校
    北岳阜平五区羊马楼村一百三十多户，在土改前有百分之八都是佃户，光租子就拿着二百大石。农民的收入就靠着山坡地的出产，农民的生活苦，文化也很低；土改后农民翻了身，生活比过去也强了，大家对文化学习也非常迫切。过秋后全村六十几个儿童入了学的就有四十多个。现在闲了，该村二十多个青壮年组织起来，大家摊钱买灯油，请教员给他们上识字课、珠算。每到吃了晚饭就到学校里去念书，都很高兴的说：“经济上翻了身，文化上也得要上进哪！”
