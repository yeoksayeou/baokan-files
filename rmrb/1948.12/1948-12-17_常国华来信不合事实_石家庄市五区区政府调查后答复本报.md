Chang Guohua's Letter Contains Untruths
　　Shijiazhuang City Fifth District Government Responds to This Newspaper

Reply to Mr. Chang Guohua of Taoyuan Village, Fifth District, Shijiazhuang City:
　　Your letter stated that thirteen households in your village were wrongly classified as middle peasants and have not yet been returned their property or received appropriate compensation. The result of our investigation through the Fifth District Government is: After the reclassification of status in your village, all thirteen households of wrongly classified middle peasants have been compensated. Among them, the waterwheels and carts of nine households have been completely returned, and for the seven households' livestock, some were returned livestock, and some were compensated with money. Most of the furniture has been returned, and most of the clothes and bedding have been distributed, so they were not completely returned. Based on this situation, you and other households have received appropriate compensation, yet you say that you have not been compensated, which is completely inconsistent with the facts. This kind of behavior of attempting to use rectification work to fabricate false situations to attack the government is wrong, and you must resolutely correct it.

　　常国华来信不合事实
  　石家庄市五区区政府调查后答复本报答石家庄市五区桃园村常国华君：
    来信说你村十三户错斗中农，至今尚未退还与作适当补偿。我们请五区区政府调查的结果：你村在改订成份后，十三户错斗中农均已进行了补偿，其中有九户的水车、大车已完全退回，七户的牲口有的退了牲口，有的还了钱，家具大部退回，衣服被褥多已分配，故未完全退回。根据这个情况，对你与其他户均已进行了适当补偿，而你却说至今尚未补偿，这根本与事实不符。这种企图利用纠偏工作制造假情况攻击政府的行为，是不对的，你必须坚决改正。
