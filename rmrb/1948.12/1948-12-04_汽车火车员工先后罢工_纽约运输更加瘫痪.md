Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 28th—New York: Three thousand New York truck drivers and employees of special express trains went on strike on the 22nd and 24th respectively. New York's transportation, already paralyzed by the ongoing strike of 65,000 longshoremen on the East Coast for more than ten days, is now facing even greater difficulties. One of America's largest railway companies has announced the cessation of freight transport to New York. The strikes of sailors and longshoremen on the East and West Coasts were still ongoing as of the 26th. Labor and management are currently in negotiations. All goods can now only be rerouted through South Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico ports, which have far smaller throughput than the striking ports, as well as the Canadian ports of Halifax and Montreal for export. The export of Marshall Plan aid to Europe has largely come to a standstill. Marshall Plan administrator Hoffman therefore made a special appeal to the longshoremen on the 19th, but the workers completely ignored it and decided not to load or unload any goods unless their new wage demands were met.

　　汽车火车员工先后罢工
  　纽约运输更加瘫痪
    【新华社陕北二十八日电】纽约讯：纽约卡车司机三千人与特别快车雇员于二十二日及二十四日先后举行罢工。因东海岸六万五千码头工人罢工持续十余日而陷于瘫痪的纽约运输至此益感困难，美国最大铁道公司之一已宣告停止运货赴纽约。东西海岸海员及码头工人罢工，截至二十六日止，仍在坚持中。劳资双方正进行谈判。一切货物，现只能转道由吐纳量远较罢工港口为小的南大西洋与墨西哥湾诸港，以及加拿大的哈利法克斯与蒙特里尔两港出口。马歇尔计划援欧物资出口大部陷于停顿，马歇尔计划执行人霍夫曼因此特于十九日向码头工人呼吁，但工人对之毫不理睬，决定除非达到新工资要求，决不装卸任何货物。
