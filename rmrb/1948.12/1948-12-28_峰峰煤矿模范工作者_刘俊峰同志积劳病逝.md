(Taihang Telegram) Comrade Liu Junfeng, a model worker of the state-owned Fengfeng Coal Mine Company, a first-class labor hero, and director of the first-branch warehouse, unfortunately passed away due to illness caused by overwork. All warehouse staff were deeply saddened and mourned his passing. The company's leaders jointly expressed their condolences to his family and provided compensation. Comrade Liu was a native of Neiqiu County, Hebei Province, 32 years old, and a probationary member of the Communist Party of China. In 1946, during the emergency preparations for war at the Liuhegou Coal Mine, Comrade Liu served as the deputy director of the mine's transportation section. In order to quickly evacuate revolutionary property, he worked tirelessly, forgetting sleep and meals. In the severe cold of the third month of winter, Comrade Liu fearlessly waded through the freezing Zhang River day and night, ultimately preserving the revolutionary property and being elected as a top-class labor hero by all the employees. Afterwards, even while ill, he did not reduce his work efficiency due to his illness, tirelessly persisting in his work. Later, the mine leadership, seeing that Comrade Liu's illness was already very serious, repeatedly asked him to rest and receive treatment, but he always put work first with a selfless spirit, only agreeing to go to the hospital for treatment when his illness became critical. After slightly improving, he automatically returned to his post. Due to the illness not being completely cured, after working for less than a month, the old illness suddenly relapsed, his heart ruptured, and he passed away before receiving medical treatment. Before his death, he was still drafting an outline for summarizing and inspecting work, and writing letters to comrades in various branch warehouses, preparing to convene a meeting to summarize work. The company's Party Committee, in view of Comrade Liu's active and responsible attitude towards revolutionary work and his excellent achievements, posthumously recognized him as a full member of the Party. In order to inherit Comrade Liu's unfinished work, the general warehouse is currently convening a meeting of various branch warehouses based on the plan drafted by Comrade Liu before his death, to do the work even better, in order to mourn Comrade Liu Junfeng.

　　峰峰煤矿模范工作者
  　刘俊峰同志积劳病逝
    【太行电】公营峰峰煤矿公司模范工作者，一等劳动英雄一分仓库主任刘俊峰同志，因公积劳成疾不治，不幸逝世。所有仓库工作人员，莫不悲痛哀悼，该公司各负责人，联名悼唁其家属并给以抚恤。刘同志系河北省内邱县人，现年三十二岁，中共候补党员，一九四六年，六河沟煤矿紧急备战，刘同志为该矿运输科副科长，他为了将革命财产迅速撤退，曾废寝忘食地完成任务。在严寒的冬三月中，刘同志毫不畏惧地在将要结冰的漳河里，日夜淌渡，终于保存了革命财产，被全体职工推选为头等劳动英雄。以后他虽在病中，却未因病减弱自己的工作效率，不知疲倦地坚持自己的工作。后来该矿领导上见刘同志的病已经很严重了，再三让其休养治疗，但他总是以忘我的精神把工作放在第一位，直到病的危险时期，才肯进医院治疗。稍好，即又自动回到工作岗位。由于病未痊愈，工作了不及一月，旧病突又复发，心脏破裂，不及医治而逝世。临终前还伏案草拟检查总结工作提纲，并给所属各支库同志写信，准备召开会议总结工作。公司党委会因刘同志对革命工作积极负责，成绩优良，特追认为正式党员。总仓库为继承刘同志的未尽事业，正依据刘同志临终前所拟计划，召开各支仓库会议，要把工作更加作好，来悼念刘俊峰同志。
