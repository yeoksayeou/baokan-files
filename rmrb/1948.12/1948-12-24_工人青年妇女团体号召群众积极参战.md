[Jizhong Electric] Various mass organizations in Jizhong have recently called on all youth, women, and workers in the region to mobilize and actively support the Pingjin Campaign. The Youth Federation's call stated: All urban and rural youth should hold youth conferences in their villages (or streets) and youth representative conferences in their districts (or several villages) to discuss specific tasks in supporting the front lines, set plans, establish covenants, and challenge each other in competitions. Young men should strive to be the first to volunteer for work, thoroughly complete tasks in the militia, capture more scattered bandits, and sincerely take care of the wounded in the civilian labor corps' stretcher teams. They should educate civilian laborers who lack awareness, ensuring they do not run away or shirk; they should promote victory to the masses in the newly liberated areas, and promote the Party and the People's Government's various policies; and become the backbone of the militia and civilian laborers. Young women should bravely undertake rear-area work, raise donations for comfort, and care for the families of civilian laborers. Student unions and children's groups should promptly tell the villagers about the victories on the front lines, and write letters to comfort the front-line troops, civilian labor corps, and the sick and wounded in large quantities. The Women's Federation's call stated: Women's Federation cadres at all levels must use a hundredfold of their hard work spirit to widely and deeply carry out propaganda, encouragement and organization work among women to support the front. Members and the vast number of women in various places should effectively mobilize their husbands and children to actively support the front lines. Women should actively sew, wash, comfort, rescue the wounded, grind rice, and cooperate with troops and civilian laborers in guarding posts and capturing scattered bandits. In addition, they must work with the men who stay at home to complete the land reform work. The Jizhong Federation of Trade Unions called on workers throughout the region to give play to the great role of the working class. Transportation workers should complete their tasks day and night, regardless of wind or snow, and increase the speed and quantity of transportation. Workers in various places should step up production, improve quality and output to support the front lines.

[Another Dispatch] The Youth Work Committee of the CPC Jizhong District Committee has suggested to the preparatory committees of the New Democratic Youth League in various counties that youth league front-line committees be established, based on the county civilian labor corps, to lead the work of league members in supporting the front, and to absorb outstanding youth and youth hero models who have completed tasks in supporting the front into the League. It also put forward the slogan "Joining the League at the front is extremely glorious," and after joining the League, a front-line membership certificate will be issued.
