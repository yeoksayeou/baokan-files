	Battlefield Leaflets from the Taiyuan Front
	Ouyang Mo

	During the battle of Naoma, a certain unit created "battlefield leaflets" to promptly commend heroes and role models, summarize combat experience, and serve as cultural entertainment for the soldiers. These leaflets played a significant role in boosting morale and enhancing tactical and political education.

	When the unit began combat mobilization, the leaflet editorial department published a battlefield leaflet entitled "New and Veteran Soldiers Achieve Meritorious Service Together," which stated:

	"You performed meritorious service in the Linfen battle, and were hailed as heroes in the Jinzhong campaign. Veteran soldiers, truly glorious, now approaching Taiyuan City, everyone is determined to perform meritorious service again.

	New soldiers have participated in the People's Liberation Army for a short time, but they also gained experience in the Qiucun battle.

	Taking Taiyuan is a true glory, all comrades will perform meritorious service!"

	During the Qiucun battle, Zhao Er'cheng, a soldier who had recently joined the PLA, completed his mission by blowing up a pillbox single-handedly. The leaflet praised him:

	"Zhao Er'cheng, very brave, went alone to blow up the pillbox. When one attempt failed, he tried again, blowing the bunker to pieces. He skillfully scouted and blew it up alone, completing the mission with great victory!"

	After reading this, the soldiers said, "If he can do it, why can't we?" and began to formulate plans to kill the enemy. At this time, the regimental committee issued a call for joining the Party at the front line. The sixth issue of the leaflet published a message:

	"The Special Service Company held a meeting of cadres above the platoon level yesterday to convey the call of the regimental committee. Comrade Chen Jing declared on the spot: 'I will serve the proletariat permanently! I am determined to strive to join the Party in the glorious task of attacking Taiyuan. And I hope that the Party branch and non-Party cadres and soldiers will see in combat whether I am qualified!'"

	Immediately following, the seventh issue of the leaflet published the news of Yang Junqing being admitted to the Party at the front line during the Qiucun battle:

	"Comrade Yang Junqing is a squad leader of the 1st Company. He performed meritorious service during the Linfen campaign by holding the No. 4 bunker on position 106. During the Jinzhong campaign, he was already wounded, but he continued to suppress the enemy with machine-gun fire, and encouraged all the comrades in the squad to fight with confidence, completing the mission. He is also hardworking and enduring, often carrying 300 rounds of ammunition on marches.

	He repeatedly requested to join the Party, stating: 'If I join the Party today and sacrifice tomorrow, the Communist Party will still have my name.' This time in the Qiucun battle, he was a member of the shock troops and was very brave; therefore, the branch admitted him as a member of the Chinese Communist Party."

	These two issues of the leaflet caused a great sensation among the soldiers. Within two or three days, more than forty soldiers signed up, requesting to join the Party at the front line. (After this battle, a total of fifty-two were approved to join the Party.) They reflected, "We've wanted to join the Party for a long time, but we didn't know what the conditions for joining were. After reading this, we understand." They all immediately formulated their own plans to kill the enemy, expressing their determination to join the Party. The plan of Liu Shangming, a soldier who had recently joined, stated: "Don't just listen to good words in peacetime, only look at the merits in wartime, facts after the battle will reveal who is superior." In combat, he took on the task of storming the enemy. When he approached the enemy bunker, he had no grenades, so he stuck a hand-cannon in the gun hole and pulled the fuse. The enemy blocked the gun hole, so it couldn't explode inside, and he was wounded in the head. He still endured the pain and charged forward, engaging the enemy in the trench with hand grenades, and unfortunately sacrificed himself, allowing the following troops to charge forward. The regimental committee posthumously recognized him as a Communist Party member.

	When newly liberated soldiers told of the suffering caused by Yan Xishan's oppression, the leaflet published a quick-rhythm verse by Wei Gengwu, liberated in the Jinzhong campaign:

	"I am Wei Gengwu from the 9th Platoon of the 2nd Company, this time I must take revenge. I am determined to fight from the east mountain, I can see Taiyuan City at a glance. My brother is still in Yan Xishan's army, suffering terribly. I will be at the front of the assault, so that my brother can be at ease."

	This quick-rhythm verse also caused great excitement among the newly liberated soldiers. After hearing this, Wang Jicai, a correspondent from the 4th Company, remembered that two older brothers and two younger brothers were forced into Yan Xishan's army. He was also determined to take revenge and liberate his brothers. Liu Sanhu's two older brothers were also drafted into the army by Yan Xishan, his father died of anger, and his mother became ill. He said bitterly, "Even if my arms are broken, I will fight the enemy to the end!" Zhao Sihai of the 7th Company had his older brother buried alive by Yan Xishan's soldiers during the "self-confession rebirth," so his hatred was even greater. They all made plans to avenge themselves and kill the enemy, and they behaved very bravely in combat. Liu Sanhu single-handedly carried a machine gun mount, and Wang Jicai also volunteered to charge, both completing their missions.

	After the 8th Company completed the defense of position 206, the leaflet immediately summarized and published their calm and unhurried defense experience:

	"Comrades must remember: The fortifications must be strong, not afraid of bombs and artillery. Don't shoot from afar, don't panic up close, use hand grenades to wipe out the enemy's counterattacks."

	Seeing the hard work of the Pingding civilian laborers, the leaflet promptly commended them:

	The Pingding civilian laborers are truly capable, and they don't haggle over assigned work; you are not afraid of high mountains and long roads, each person has to carry four boxes of artillery shells. Carry fifteen sacks, and also send ammunition, explosives, and hand grenades, send door panels, transport large rafters, and do everything. Your efforts for the front line are appreciated by everyone on the front line!

	The civilian laborers were very excited. A seventeen-year-old boy, after delivering the lottery number, voluntarily brought a rafter (for fortifications) to the front and mobilized everyone to work hard.

	In terms of form, various forms such as quick-rhythm verses, news, poems, and comic strips are adopted, and they are short and interesting. Each issue does not exceed three hundred words, with illustrations, and is printed on twenty-four open-sized glossy paper (mimeographed). After each issue is released, the soldiers scramble to read it: Who was commended? Am I mentioned? Are there any good quick-rhythm verses? At the beginning, the leaflets were edited by comrades from the propaganda and education section; but by the fifth and sixth issues, the soldiers began to write articles, writing their meritorious service plans and resolutions into quick-rhythm verses and drawing them into pictures and sending them in. For example, the artillery platoon of the machine gun company of the 3rd Battalion sent in an article entitled "Plan to Conquer Taiyuan," with the speeches of each soldier written behind it, and six people gesticulating in a meeting drawn below. After the leaflet was sorted and printed, everyone loved to read it. Later, the soldiers' articles reached more than ten per day, forming a situation where everyone participated in running the leaflets. The articles that could not be used in the leaflet were forwarded to the "Front Line News" in the brigade. This kind of leaflet has now spread rapidly in the front-line troops.

    太原前线的战场传单
    欧阳默
    淖马战斗中，某部创造了“战场传单”，及时表扬英雄模范、总结战斗经验，并作战士们的文化娱乐品，在提高战士情绪及战术、政治教育上，曾起不小的作用。
    当部队开始战斗动员时，传单编辑部就以“新老战士共同立功”为题，出了一张战场传单，上写道：
    “临汾战斗立了功，晋中战役称英雄，老战士，真光荣，现在又近太原城，人人决心再立功。
    新战士参加解放军虽然时间短，秋村战斗也有锻炼。
    打下太原真光荣，全体同志都立功！”
    秋村战斗时，解放战士赵二成单人爆炸完成任务，传单便表扬道：
    “赵二成，胆子大，单独过去把碉炸，一次未炸两次炸，碉堡炸成两圪塔。巧妙侦察单人炸，完成任务胜利大！”
    战士们念了后说：“他能咱就不能？”纷纷制订杀敌计划。这时，团委发出火线入党号召，传单第六期就登载了一条消息：
    “特务连于昨日开班以上干部会，传达团委号召。当场有陈竞同志宣誓说：‘我要为无产阶级永久服务到底！坚决要在打太原的光荣任务中争求入党。并希望党的支部及非党干部战士，在战斗中看我够格不够！’”
    紧跟着，传单第七期又登载了秋村战斗杨俊清火线入了党的消息：
    “杨俊清同志是一连一位班长，临汾战役坚守一○六阵地四号碉立了功。晋中战役时，他已负伤，仍然一面用机枪火力压倒敌人，一面鼓舞了全班同志战斗信心，完成了任务，平时也吃苦耐劳，常背三百发子弹行军。
    他屡次要求入党，提出：‘今天加入了党，明天牺牲了，共产党内也有了我的名字。’这次秋村战斗，他又当突击队员，非常勇敢；因此支部吸收他为中国共产党的党员。”
    这两期传单在战士们中间震动很大，两三天内就有四十多个战士报名，要求火线上入党。（此次战斗后，共有五十二位批准入党）他们反映说：“咱早就想入党，就是不知入党条件是啥？看了这，咱就明白了。”都立刻订出自己的杀敌计划，表示入党决心。解放战士刘尚明计划上说：“不怕平时说得好，单看战时的功劳，战后事实比低高。”战斗中他担任突击，冲上去接近敌碉堡时，没有手榴弹，就把手炮塞在枪眼里拉着，敌人挡住枪眼炸不进去，反回来打伤了他的头，他仍然忍痛冲上，在交通壕与敌拼开手榴弹，竟不幸牺牲，而后面部队得以冲上。团委会特追认为共产党员。
    在新解放战士诉阎匪压榨的苦时，传单登了晋中战役解放的卫更五的一个快板：
    “我是二连九班卫更五，这次一定要报仇。东山头上下决心，一眼望到太原城。我哥还在阎匪军，受苦受罪太惨凄。突击我要在前头，解放我哥才安心。”
    这个快板在新解放的战士中也引起很大激动。四连通讯员王积财听了后，想起两个哥哥两个兄弟都被阎匪逼迫当了兵，也决心要报仇，要解放他的弟兄。刘三虎的两个哥，都被阎匪拉去当兵，父亲气死，母亲得了病。他忿恨的说：“就是把我胳膊打断，也要和敌人拼到底！”七连赵四孩，曾被阎匪强迫着在“自白转生”时活埋了他的哥哥，仇恨更大。他们都订了报仇杀敌计划，战斗中表现非常勇敢。刘三虎一人包扛机枪架，王积财也自报奋勇冲锋，都完成了他们的任务。
    八连坚守二○六阵地完成后，传单又即时将他们沉着不慌的坚守经验总结登出去：
    “同志们要记好：工事要作牢，不怕炸弹和大炮。远不打枪近不慌，手榴弹把反扑敌人消灭光。”
    看到平定民工的辛勤，传单及时又作了表扬：
    平定民工真能干，分配工作不讲价钱；你们不怕山高路又远，每人要担四箱大炮弹。背起麻袋十五条，又送子弹炸药手榴弹，送门板，运大椽，样样抢着干。你们这样为前线，前线听到都喜欢！
    民工看了很兴奋，一个十七岁小鬼，送下彩号后，去前方时又自动捎一根椽（作工事），并动员大家都好好干。
    在形式上采取快板、消息、诗歌、连环画多种多样形式，又简短，又有趣味，每期最多不超过三百字，附插图，有光纸二十四开（油印）。每期下来后，战士们都争抢着看：表扬了谁？有自己没有？有好的快板没有？传单一开始，还是宣教股同志编；但到五、六期时，战士们便写来了稿子，把自己的立功计划、决心等都写成快板、画成画送来。如三营机炮连炮班送来一篇稿，题目是“包打太原的计划”，后面写上各战士的发言，下面并画着六个人指手画脚地开会。传单加以整理印出后，大家很爱看。以后，每天战士的稿子达到十多篇，形成战士大家办传单。传单用不了的稿子，便转寄到旅里的“火线报”上去。现此种传单已在前线各部队中迅速传开。
