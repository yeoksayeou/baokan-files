Xinhua News Agency, Huaihai Front, 16th: Since the start of the Huaihai Campaign, the broad masses of people in the new and restored areas have warmly welcomed and supported the People's Liberation Army. On the night of November 10th, when a unit of the People's Liberation Army urgently needed to cross the Bulao River northeast of Xuzhou to pursue and annihilate fleeing enemies, the people on the south bank quickly gathered all the small boats to carry the PLA across the river. Disregarding fatigue, cold, and enemy aircraft bombing, they tirelessly ferried the troops to the south bank boat after boat. Boatman Zhao Cangyi rowed for a day and a night without rest, saying, "We've been hoping for you comrades to come and help us turn ourselves around." In the battle where the People's Liberation Army annihilated the 63rd Corps of the enemy at Chawan Town, northwest of Suqian, three old men from the town rescued the wounded soldier Li Qingsheng from the battlefield late at night. They mobilized the townspeople to make a stretcher out of wooden beds, took off their cotton-padded clothes to cover Li, and quickly carried him to the PLA's dressing station. When a unit of the People's Liberation Army arrived at Gupi Town, northwest of Suining, the people of the town lined the streets to welcome the PLA. An old woman named Zheng, who had been the chairwoman of the women's association, rushed out of her house, grabbed a PLA soldier, and said, "As long as I have a breath left, I will wait for you, and you have really come!" The people of the town repeatedly accused the Chiang bandits of slaughtering hundreds of people during their more than two-year occupation of the area. Men from Tongshan and Suining counties set out to carry stretchers, while women and children at home ground flour day and night for the PLA, with the entire county providing 150,000 catties of white flour per day. Xie Mingyun, the village head of Xiewan Village, eighteen li east of Su County, was so busy supporting the front that he had been working for ten days and nights, his eyes swollen. Shen Shikui, a peddler from Erpuji, east of Su County, automatically waited to guide the way at night upon hearing that the PLA had arrived, and led the way twelve times in just a few days. After the liberation of Xuzhou, the people everywhere nodded happily to the PLA personnel and said, "We can live in peace now!" On the way to pursue and annihilate Qiu Qingquan and other three corps of fleeing bandits from Xuzhou, when the People's Liberation Army arrived at Xiejiawei, northwest of Su County, the old women brought out the pickled vegetables and chili peppers they had stored at home, insisting that the soldiers eat before leaving. When the people in the area eighteen li southeast of Lanyi and Yongcheng heard that Qiu Qingquan's bandit troops had finally been surrounded by the People's Liberation Army, they said excitedly, "It couldn't be better!" and voluntarily assisted in capturing scattered bandits.

　　淮海新区人民
  　热烈支援我军作战
    【新华社淮海前线十六日电】淮海战役开始后，广大新区和恢复区人民热情欢迎与支援解放军。十一月十日夜，当解放军某部为了追歼逃敌，急待渡过徐州东北的不老河时，南岸人民即迅速把所有的小船集中起来载解放军渡河。他们不顾疲劳、寒冷和敌机的轰炸，不停地把部队一船一船送到南岸。船夫赵苍义划了一昼夜的船还不肯休息，他说：“俺们就盼同志们来帮助俺们翻身。”解放军在宿迁西北岔湾镇歼敌六十三军的战斗中，该镇三个老大爷深夜自动从战地上把伤员李庆生抢救下来，动员镇民用木床做了一付担架，把棉衣脱下来给李盖上，然后迅速地抬到解放军的包扎所。当解放军某部进抵睢宁西北的古邳镇时，该镇人民纷纷排到街上来欢迎解放军。当过妇女会长的郑大娘奔到门外，拉住解放军的战士说：“只要活着有一口气，我就要等着你们，你们可真来了！”镇上人民纷纷向解放军控诉蒋匪侵占该地两年多以来屠杀数百人的暴行。铜（山）睢（宁）县男子出发抬担架，妇女儿童在家日夜给解放军磨面，全县每天可供给白面十五万斤。宿县东十八里谢万村的村长谢明云，为支援前线的工作忙了十天十夜，眼都熬肿了。宿县东二铺集的小贩沈世魁，听说解放军来了，晚上自动等着带路，几天中间一连带了十二次。徐州解放后，人民到处向解放军的人员欢欣点头说：“俺这就得过太平年了！”在追歼徐州逃匪邱清泉等三个兵团的途中，解放军到达宿县西北的谢家圩时，大娘们端着家藏的咸菜辣椒等，坚持要战干们吃了饭再走。兰县永城东南十八里一带的人民听到邱清泉等部匪军终于陷入解放军的重围时，都兴奋地说：“那可不能再好了！”纷纷自动协助捉拿散匪。
