　　Baoding is Undergoing Reconstruction
    The Chinese Communist Party, leading the people, is capable of managing rural areas well and is equally capable of managing cities well. The facts in Baoding City in the two weeks since its liberation, like those of many other liberated cities, large and small, once again prove this truth.

    Baoding City, an important city in North China, has seen the rapid establishment of democratic order throughout the city since its liberation on November 22nd. This is due to the clear urban policies of the CCP Central Committee, the timely instructions of the CCP North China Central Bureau, the direct leadership of the city's Military Control Commission, and the arduous efforts of the incoming troops, cadres, and citizens. They have overcome and continue to overcome the numerous difficulties left behind by the enemy and puppet regime's decade-plus of enslavement and destruction. Various municipal constructions are being actively carried out. Sanitation workers have long since resumed work, and the streets are extremely clean. The garrison troops are temporarily taking over the duties of the police, maintaining public order throughout the city, and directing street traffic. Incidents of kidnapping, assassination, rape, suicide, and so on, which were common under Chiang Kai-shek's rule, are no longer heard of here.

    When Liu Huanan, the commander of the Kuomintang bandit army's 101st Army, 22nd Division, entrenched in Baoding, abandoned the city and fled, he carried out large-scale destruction of Baoding citizens and various public and private constructions. According to incomplete statistics, over a hundred people were shot and killed or bombed to death by the bandits; the water tower and material factory at the station and the four iron bridges over the Fu River, as well as important equipment such as the water supply pipes and water tanks of the electricity company, and all the city's electric and telephone lines, were burned or destroyed; the largest flour mill in Baoding, Qianyi Flour Company, was also burned down; thousands of private industrial and commercial businesses and citizens were looted and burned. In the first street of Nanguan alone, more than three hundred houses were destroyed. The bandit gangs also carried out serious burning and looting of the city's public and private schools, including Hebei Provincial Medical College. According to incomplete statistics from eleven middle schools, 37,000 books and 950 pieces of equipment were lost, and over a thousand teachers and students were threatened and forced to leave, in an attempt to make it impossible to rebuild Baoding.

    However, the bandits' inhuman atrocities were met with staunch resistance from the city's people, especially the working class, from the very beginning. Railway workers Zang Anshao and others automatically protected important equipment in the midst of extreme chaos at the station, ensuring that six engines and two water pumps were not destroyed. Zhu Zhenhua, Qiu Wei, and other workers at the Kuomintang Hebei Provincial Government Printing Office automatically guarded the factory, ensuring that printing presses, type, and other materials were not lost. There are countless other examples of workers protecting public places and public buildings. Song Liansheng, a janitor at the Medical College, protected four large crates of the school's equipment, allowing the school to resume classes quickly.

    After the People's Liberation Army entered the city, workers similarly demonstrated the great role of the proletariat in the recovery and construction of various public enterprises. The post office began communicating with various liberated areas on the second day after liberation. As of the 11th, there were already more than 560 railway employees. Currently, workers are rushing to repair railways and bridges to the south, striving to open traffic with Shijiazhuang as soon as possible. At the electricity company, all employees except those who were taken away by the enemy have resumed work and repaired the enemy-damaged generators, water supply pipes, water tanks, and the city's lines. At the same time, under the leadership of the People's Government, the coal shortage that Chiang Kai-shek had been unable to solve in the past was resolved, and the electric lights, which had been out for more than three months, shone again. Employees of the telecommunications bureau have restored citywide telephone service. Workers at the former Kuomintang Provincial Government Printing Office quickly sorted out various materials, allowing the city's New Baoding Daily to be published smoothly.

    As of the 8th of this month, 4,419 private factories and shops in the city had resumed operations, including grain, cotton cloth, ironwork, hardware, medicine, leather, woodware, iron goods, general merchandise, sauce gardens, and books and stationery, accounting for 72.5 percent of the original 5,929 industrial and commercial households. More than a thousand other households are also preparing to resume operations. Jizhong Trading Company's Dachang General Store distributed large quantities of grain, oil, salt, and other necessities to supply citizens on the third day after liberation. The Baoding Office of the People's Bank of China systematically eliminated Chiang Kai-shek currency, adjusted domestic and foreign prices in the city, gradually stabilized prices, and facilitated the smooth circulation of the new currency, so that Baoding City, which had been isolated from the countryside for more than ten years, was integrated with the vast countryside as soon as it was liberated. The desolate market quickly showed vigorous vitality.

    Schools, especially primary schools, have recovered very quickly. All thirteen secondary schools in the city officially jointly resumed classes on the third day after liberation, with more than 800 students currently. There are more than 70 faculty members. All sixteen public primary schools have fully resumed classes. Eleven of the eighteen private primary schools have resumed classes. In some schools, desks and benches were burned by Liu's bandits, and students brought their own benches to attend class. The total number of primary school students has now reached more than 4,000. The 100,000 volumes of books in the Lianchi Academy Library have been sorted out and are now open for reading. Xinhua Bookstore has shipped in a large number of books, which are extremely popular with citizens. The New Baoding Daily has been distributed throughout the city since its founding. The original two Peking opera theaters have also opened early.

    In order to provide relief to poor disaster victims without labor, the Baoding Military Control Commission has allocated 100,000 jin of relief grain, which will be distributed by the district and street governments in conjunction with local fair and poor citizens to conduct door-to-door investigations and provide relief separately. For disaster victims with labor, the general approach is to provide grain loans, loans, organize production, or use work-for-relief methods to solve their production problems. Cart drivers who have been unemployed for more than ten years have resumed operations with the help of trading companies. The Military Control Commission has set up a temporary treatment center to treat citizens who were killed or injured by Liu's bandits. Currently, the Municipal Hospital, Railway Hospital, and others have opened one after another.

    Inspired by the People's Government's lenient policies, hundreds of enemy and puppet personnel have registered with the government, and some of them have turned in their Kuomintang certificates and documents. With the exception of counter-revolutionaries who are willing to be enemies of the people and continue to do evil, the democratic municipal government generally adopts the policy of retaining the original positions and salaries for middle and lower-level employees and workers of the former Kuomintang economic, cultural, and transportation agencies. In addition to borrowing some living expenses, the basic salaries are currently being investigated in preparation for conversion into millet for distribution. The railway employees' November salaries have been paid on time, greatly stabilizing the morale of the employees. The December salaries for faculty and staff of public schools have also been partially paid. In the process of cleaning up enemy and public materials, many workers and citizens took the initiative to report to the government. Gao Zhendong, a water worker, automatically handed over six boxes of Western medicines and two large boxes of electrical materials hidden by the bandit army. Yang Chungui, a soldier of the former Chiang Kai-shek army's Hebei Security 9th Regiment, threw a machine gun and two boxes of ammunition into a well when Liu's bandits fled and ran home. After the city was liberated, he immediately returned to report to the district government and said to people: "I used to go the wrong way and do bad things. Now I am determined to correct it and hand over the gun to atone for my sins." The government has now found a large number of enemy and puppet hidden military materials, with grain alone reaching more than one million jin. The municipal government has given awards to those who have protected, voluntarily surrendered, or reported and found meritorious service in enemy and public materials.

    In various recovery work, many difficulties have been encountered. For example, in the early days of liberation, some citizens, due to being deceived by enemy propaganda and lacking understanding of our policies, had many concerns in their minds. After the government held forums for workers, students, teachers, and businessmen to vigorously publicize the current situation and explain the government's various policies, they gradually eliminated their concerns. Although various tasks in Baoding will still encounter some difficulties in the future, the strength of the people is great, and the people can overcome all difficulties like this period and manage this people's city better.

　　保定在重建中
    中国共产党领导着人民，能够很好地管理农村，同样也能够很好地管理城市。保定市解放迄今两旬以来的事实，正和其它解放的许多大小城市一样，又一次证明这一真理。
    保定市这一座华北的重要城市，自十一月二十二日解放后，由于中共中央有明确的城市政策，在中共华北中央局及时指示与该市军管会直接领导之下，加上入城部队、干部人员、与市民们的艰苦努力，排除了并且继续排除着敌伪十余年来的奴役、破坏遗留下来的重重困难，使全市民主秩序迅速建立起来。各项市政建设，正在积极进行。清道工人早已复工，街道极为整洁。警备部队暂时代替警察职务，维持全市治安，指挥街道交通。蒋匪统治时的绑票、暗杀、强奸、自杀等等事件，在这里再也听不到了。
    原来盘踞保定的国民党匪军一零一军二十二师师长刘匪化南，在弃城逃窜时，对保定市民及各项公私建设，曾大肆破坏。据不完全统计：被匪枪杀、炸死者达百人以上；车站上的水塔、材料厂和府河上的四座铁桥，电灯公司的送水管、盖水箱等重要器材及全市电灯、电话线，皆被烧毁或破坏；保市最大的面粉厂——乾义面粉公司也被焚毁；私营工商业及市民，惨遭洗劫、烧毁者，数以千计。仅南关第一街房屋被毁者即达三百余间。匪帮们对该市各公私学校，包括河北省立医学院也进行了严重的烧掠破坏。据十一个中学不完全统计：仅图书即损失三万七千册，仪器九百五十件，同时威胁逼走教职学员千余人。企图使保定无法重建。
    但是匪帮们这样灭绝人性的暴行，一开始就遭到该市人民、特别是工人阶级的顽强反抗。铁路工人臧暗稍等，在车站秩序极度混乱中，自动保护重要器材，使六个机身，两个水泵未被破坏。国民党河北省政府印刷所工人朱振华、邱维等，自动看管工厂，使印刷机、铅字等未遭损失。其他工人对公共场所、公共建筑的保护范例，亦不胜枚举；医学院校役宋连生，保护住该校仪器达四大箱，使学校得以迅速复课。
    解放军入城后，在恢复建设各项公营企业中，工人们同样显示了无产阶级的伟大作用。邮局于解放后第二日，即开始与解放区各地通邮。截至十一日，铁路员工已达五百六十余人。现工人正向南赶修铁路、桥梁，争取早日与石家庄通车。在电灯公司，除被敌里走者外，全体职工已全部复工，并修好了被敌破坏的发电机、送水管、盖水箱及全市线路。同时在人民政府领导下，解决了过去蒋匪无法解决的煤荒问题，使停电已达三个多月的电灯，重放光明。电讯局员工，已使全城恢复通话。前国民党省政府印刷所的工人，迅速整理各种器材，使该市新保定日报得以顺利出版。
    市内各私营工厂商行，截至本月八日，先后复业者已达四千四百一十九户，其中包括粮食、棉布、铁工、五金、医药、皮革、木器、铁货、百货、酱园及书籍文具等业，占原有工商户五千九百二十九户的百分之七十二点五。其他一千多户，亦正筹备复业。冀中贸易公司大昌总店，在解放后第三天即配售大批粮、油、盐等必需品供应市民。中国人民银行保定办事处，有步骤地排除蒋币，调整市内外物价，使物价渐趋稳定，新币顺利流通，使和农村隔绝了十多年的保定市，一经解放，即和广大农村打成一片。冷落的市场，很快呈现着蓬勃的生气。
    学校，特别是小学，恢复甚为迅速。全市十三个中等学校，在解放后的第三天，即正式联合复课，现有学生八百余人。教职员七十余人。公立小学十六处，已完全复课。私立小学十八处，已复课者十一处。有的学校桌凳被刘匪烧毁一空，学生们自带板凳前来上课。现小学学生总数已达四千余人。莲池书院图书馆十万册图书，经整理后已开放阅览。新华书店运来大批书籍，极为市民欢迎。新保定日报创刊后，已行销全市。原有的两家平剧院，亦早开院。
    为了救济无劳动力的贫苦灾难民，保市军管会特拨发赈粮十万斤，由各区街政府结合当地公正贫苦市民进行挨户调查，分别救济。对有劳动力的灾难民，则一般采取贷粮、贷款、组织生产，或以工代赈的办法解决他们的生产问题。失业了十多年的大车夫，现在贸易公司的帮助下，已纷纷复业。被刘匪杀伤的市民，军管会曾设立临时救治所，予以治疗。现市立医院、铁路医院等已先后开业。
    在人民政府宽大政策感召下，向政府登记之敌伪人员，已有数百人，他们中的一部分，并已交出了国民党证与文件。除甘心与人民为敌、继续作恶的反革命分子外，民主市政府对原国民党经济、文化、交通等机关的中下级职员与工人，一般都采取原职原薪、继续留任的方针。除已借给一部分生活费用外，现正调查底薪，准备折合小米发给。铁路员工的十一月份工资，已按时发给，大大稳定了职工情绪。各公立学校教职员十二月份的薪金，也已发下一部。在清理敌伪及公共物资中，许多工人和市民主动向政府报告。泄水工人高振东自动交出匪军所藏之六箱西药和两大箱电料器材。前蒋军河北保安第九团士兵杨春贵，在刘匪逃窜时，把一挺机枪和两箱子弹投在井里，逃跑回家。该市解放后，即刻回来报告区政府，并对人说：“我以前走错了道，作了坏事，现在决心改正，交枪赎罪。”现政府已查出大批敌伪隐藏的军火物资，仅粮食即达百余万斤。市政府对于保护或自动交出或报告后查出敌人及公共物资有功者，均分别予以奖励。
    在各项恢复工作中，曾遇到不少困难，如解放初期，一部分市民，由于受了敌人的欺骗宣传，及对我政策缺乏了解，思想上存在许多顾虑，经过政府分别召开工人、学生、教职员、商人等座谈会，大力宣传目前时局，讲解政府各种政策后，已逐渐消除了。保市今后的各种工作，虽仍会遇到一些困难，但人民的力量是伟大的，人民能够象这一时期一样的克服一切困难，把这座人民的城市管理得更好。
