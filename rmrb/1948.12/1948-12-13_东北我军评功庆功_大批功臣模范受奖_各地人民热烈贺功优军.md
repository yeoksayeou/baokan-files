Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 8th. The Northeast People's Liberation Army units are carrying out extensive campaigns to celebrate and commend meritorious service. After a unit conducted enthusiastic evaluations, the units, after public discussion, and with the approval of the higher-level Party committee, awarded a total of 3,020 people, including those who had previously performed great meritorious service (those who performed minor meritorious service were not included in the count). One regiment of the unit had 350 people who received material rewards, and all comrades in the regiment received spiritual commendation. In only two units of another department, 605 heroes emerged successively, of which 170 were those who performed meritorious service in this autumn offensive. In another unit's celebration, ten model companies and thirty heroes were credited with three major merits. The units successively held celebrations at their locations, and the scenes were unprecedentedly grand. All leaders attended and spoke in person and presented the heroes with red flowers. During one unit's celebration, victory red flowers were awarded to more than 2,800 heroes. In this autumn offensive, one company repelled seven enemy counterattacks while clearing the peripheral strongholds of Yixian, paving the way for our army to capture Yixian, and won the "Repeatedly Established Meritorious Service" award flag. One company was the first to climb the city during the capture of Jinzhou, penetrating deep into the enemy lines and capturing a large number of supplies, and was named the "Jinzhou Company" and awarded the "Brave and Tenacious" award flag. One company successfully completed its mission in the three battles of breaking through Yixian, street fighting in Jinzhou, and raiding Sujiatun in southern Shenyang, and was awarded the "Forever Glorious" pennant. A unit awarded the seven model companies that emerged during the autumn offensive with pennants such as "Jinzhou Breakthrough Company," "Sharp Knife Company," and "Steel Company." All the heroes and award-winning units expressed that they would "guard against arrogance and rashness," continue to work hard, and make greater contributions to the liberation of the whole country.
    Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 10th. While enthusiastically launching the movement to comfort the troops, the people of Northeast China responded to the call of the Northeast Political Committee and widely launched a movement to celebrate the meritorious service of the People's Liberation Army heroes and give preferential treatment to the families of the People's Liberation Army soldiers. Last month, citizens of Xiangfang District, Harbin, held a celebration for the heroes who killed the enemy, Wang Youtai, Liu Jinkui, etc., and everyone competed to send honorary lamps, honorary plaques, and consolation goods to the families of the heroes. The Qiqihar Municipal Government decided to reduce or exempt the fees for electricity and tap water for the families of the People's Liberation Army soldiers with more difficult living conditions. The city's theaters specially issued exemption tickets to entertain the families of soldiers to watch dramas, and shops automatically reduced prices for them for five days. The city also organized military family factories and military family cart production teams to help some poor families of the People's Liberation Army solve their living difficulties. On the 25th of last month, Jilin City held a city-wide celebration to commend meritorious service and give preferential treatment to the families of soldiers. The mayor of the city expressed his deep condolences to the families of the People's Liberation Army soldiers on behalf of the democratic government and presented a large number of consolation goods. In the past six months, the city has organized cooperatives for the families of soldiers, issued loan grain, and taken various measures to solve their living difficulties. Therefore, they are very grateful to the government and the people. They all expressed that they would work hard to produce, support the war, and strive for the victory of the whole country as soon as possible. People from all walks of life in Andong City launched a campaign to donate clothes and give preferential treatment to the families of soldiers, donating a large number of clothes, bedding, and grain. In the vast rural areas, farmers held celebrations to commend meritorious service at the natural village level. Some districts and villages organized "Preferential Treatment Teams," beating gongs and drums to send condolences to the families of soldiers and congratulate them. Some districts and villages specially set up banquets or held entertainment evenings to entertain them. The families of soldiers felt very gratified and wrote letters to their children, encouraging them to continue to work hard to kill the enemy and make meritorious service, and to fight into the interior to liberate all of China. After the movement to comfort the troops and give preferential treatment to the families of soldiers in Songjiang Province began, the government of Mulan County issued a notice to commend the hero Wang Wencai. After the news spread, residents of nearby villages also sent congratulatory representatives, leading the Yangko team, carrying honorary plaques and various gifts to Wang's house to congratulate them, and the whole village was filled with the sound of gongs and drums. After receiving the "Meritorious Service Good News," Wang Wencai's father went to the front line to encourage his son to fight more bravely and make greater contributions. He said to his son: "Our family has never been so glorious since the old days, you must do a good job!" Mr. Wang also introduced the situation in the rear at a meeting of all the soldiers in the battalion, saying: "The harvest is very good this year, our place averages five to six stones of grain per hectare, and the government and villagers take good care of the families of soldiers, comrades can rest assured to practice your skills in the front and fight into the interior, capture Chiang Kai-shek alive, and avenge our people!"
