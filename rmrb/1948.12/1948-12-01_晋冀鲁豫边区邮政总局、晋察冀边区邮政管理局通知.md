　　Circular from the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region Postal Administration and the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region Postal Administration
    Re: All business post offices in the Jinzhong, Jizhong, and Beiyue areas may redeem "Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region Royalty Exchange Coupons"
    It has been found that the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region Postal Administration, to facilitate the payment of royalties to contributors by cultural and publishing institutions, has printed several types of "Royalty Exchange Coupons" for newspapers and bookstores to use for royalty payments. These coupons can be redeemed at all business post offices within the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region. Now, because newspapers and bookstores have moved north and correspondents are located throughout North China, to ensure that contributors can redeem their royalties in a timely manner, it is stipulated that all business post offices in the Jinzhong, Jizhong, and Beiyue areas should also redeem these royalty exchange coupons from the date of receiving this notice. However, all post offices must note that these coupons come in five denominations: 1,000 yuan, 500 yuan, 300 yuan, 200 yuan, and 100 yuan, all in Hebei currency (sample attached). The front must have the small square seal with the inscription "Border Region Postal Administration" in seal script, and the back must have the official seal of the People's Daily, the Xin Dazhong Bao (New Masses Daily) Liaison Department, or the North China Xinhua Bookstore or the Taofen Bookstore, before they can be redeemed. After redemption, a date stamp should be immediately affixed to the back to indicate that it has been redeemed. Then, the redeemed coupons can be submitted to the branch office at any time or at the end of the month (add "Royalty Coupon Redemption" to the accounting科目). As for royalty exchange coupons issued by the Taihang, Taiyue, Ji'nan, and Ji-Lu-Yu areas themselves, they cannot be redeemed because of the different styles. Redemption remains limited to the original Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region. This is hereby notified.

　　晋冀鲁豫边区邮政总局、晋察冀边区邮政管理局通知
    晋中、冀中及北岳区各营业邮局均可代兑“晋冀鲁豫边区稿费兑换券”由
    查晋冀鲁豫边区邮政总局为便利文化出版机关发给投稿人稿费起见，曾印制“稿费兑换券”数种，以便报社书店支付稿费之用，在晋冀鲁豫边区内各营业邮局均可兑付。现因报社书店北迁，通讯员已遍布全华北各地，为使投稿人能及时兑到稿费起见，规定晋中、冀中及北岳区各营业邮局，自接到通知之日起，亦均应代兑上项稿费兑换券，但各局必须注意该券共分一千元、五百元、三百元、二百元及一百元五种，均系冀钞（下附样式），正面必须盖有“边区邮政总局”篆字小方戳、背面必须加盖人民日报社、新大众报社通联科或华北新华书店、韬奋书店之公章，方能照兑，并应于兑付后立即在背面加盖日戳，表明已经兑讫，然后可随时或到月终按兑讫此票呈交分局（会计科目加添“代兑稿券”）。至于太行、太岳、冀南及冀鲁豫各区自己发行的稿费兑换券，则因样式不同，不便代兑，仍限在原晋冀鲁豫边区范围内兑付，特此通知。
