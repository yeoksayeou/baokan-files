　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 4th: TASS reports: Marshal Sokolovsky, Soviet Military Governor of Germany, sent identical letters on November 29th to the three Western Military Governors of Germany, Clay, Robertson, and Koenig, urging them to pay attention to the activities carried out in the Western sectors of Berlin, with the support of their military commanders, aimed at undermining and splitting the German administrative organs in Berlin. The letter stated: "The Soviet military authorities in Berlin have emphasized the necessity of maintaining the unity of Berlin and have firmly advocated holding common democratic elections throughout Berlin. These suggestions have been ignored. Not only have common democratic elections not been held, but the Western sectors of Berlin have scheduled separatist elections for December 5th. The preparations for these separatist elections are not only devoid of a democratic and free atmosphere, but are also accompanied by police persecution and coercive methods against democratic organizations. The purpose of the separatist elections in the Western sectors of Berlin is to abolish the municipal organs and establish separate municipal councils in the Western sectors, so that the Western military authorities can act arbitrarily and without restraint, and encourage the activities of reactionary elements in the city. Separatist elements within the Berlin City Council have long been supported by certain occupying authorities, seeking to subvert the common city council and expel democratic representatives who are united with the masses of the Berlin people. The Soviet military command cannot tolerate this. The Soviet military command will not allow the activities of separatists within the Berlin City Council, which aim to split the German administrative organs in Berlin, and will, as always, devote itself to maintaining the unity of Berlin and guaranteeing the necessary conditions for the normal work of all democratic representatives in the Berlin autonomous organs."
　　
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 1st: TASS reports: The Presidium of the German People's Council issued a circular on November 27th stating that Western countries, which refuse to conclude a peace treaty with Germany and withdraw their occupation forces, are attempting to split our people by establishing a separatist West German state. Under this policy, they are dismembering the capital of Germany. For this purpose, they have announced that elections will soon be held in West Berlin. The circular pointed out that in West Berlin, progressive organizations such as the Free German Trade Union Federation and the Cultural Alliance have been deprived of all basic democratic rights; but illegal and reactionary organizations continue to exist. Because of these and similar measures, the elections in West Berlin will only be held under conditions of terror. Politicians in West Berlin have declared: "It is worth taking Berlin by war." And they are conducting the entire election campaign under this slogan of preparing for war and nationalism. The circular concluded by saying, Berlin citizens! Do not agree to this election! Prove to the German and foreign separatists that you hope for the revival of Germany and the guarantee of the unity of Berlin! Do not participate in the separatist elections!

　　索帅致函西方三总督谴责西柏林分裂选举
    【新华社陕北四日电】塔斯社讯：德境苏联军政府总督索柯洛夫斯基元帅，于十一月二十九日以同一函件分别致送德境美英法三国军政府总督克莱、罗伯逊和柯宁三人，促请他们注意在各军事指挥官支持下柏林西区所进行的旨在瓦解和分裂柏林德国行政机关的活动。该函称：“柏林苏军当局曾强调保持柏林统一的必要，并坚主全柏林实行共同的民主选举。这些建议均被置若罔闻。共同的民主选举不但不予举行，柏林西区反定于十二月五日举行分裂的选举。这一分裂选举的准备，非仅没有民主自由的气氛，而且伴以对民主团体的警察迫害和强迫方法。柏林西区分裂选举的目的，是取消市政机关，在西区建立分立的市议会，以便西方军事当局得以在该处作威作福、无所约束，并鼓励市内反动分子的活动。柏林市议会中分裂分子许久以来即得到某些占领当局的支持，力谋颠覆全市共同的议会，驱逐其中与柏林人民群众相结合的民主代表。苏军指挥部不能容忍这种事情。苏军指挥部将不容许柏林市议会分裂分子以分裂柏林德国行政机关为目的的活动，并将和往常一样，致力于保持柏林的统一并保障柏林自治机构中一切民主代表正常工作的必要条件。”
    【新华社陕北一日电】塔斯社讯：德国人民委员会主席团于十一月二十七日发出通电称，拒绝与德国缔结和约及撤退占领军的西方国家，正在企图以建立分裂的西德国家来分裂我国人民。在这一政策下，他们正在肢解德国的首都。为此目的，他们宣布即将在西柏林举行选举。通电指出，在西柏林，类如自由德国职工会联合会，文化联盟等进步团体，已被剥夺一切基本民主权利；但非法和反动的团体却继续存在。由于这一种措施以及类似的措施，西柏林的选举将只有在恐怖的情况下举行。西柏林的政客们宣称：“用战争取得柏林也是值得的。”他们并且在这一准备战争和国家主义的宣传口号之下进行整个的选举运动。通电最后称，柏林市民们！不要同意这一选举！向德国人和外国分裂者证明你们希望德国的复兴和保证柏林的统一！不要参加分裂派的选举！
