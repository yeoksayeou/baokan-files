　　Where Does My Rural-Style Bureaucratism Manifest Itself?
    Wang Yu
    What is rural-style bureaucratism? In connection with my own work, my understanding is this:
    (1) Using the excuse of the relaxed and slow-paced rural environment to excuse my own accommodation of mistakes. For example, when convening cadre meetings, those summoned would be late for no reason, affecting the progress of the meeting and wasting time, but no criticism was given, as it was thought that local cadres could not be as regular as the military. A cadre leave system was stipulated, but some district cadres still often secretly went home, which greatly affected their work, but I thought that local cadres were just like that, so I didn't criticize them and let it go.
    (2) Sloppy and delayed work. In the past, when I went down to inspect work, I would run to three or four districts a day, get a rough outline, and then go back to the office to decide on issues and issue instructions. What impressed me most was when Liu and Deng's army went south last year, and Shou Zhang County was recovered. I heard a few district and village cadres reflect: "The bad elements who colluded with the Chiang Kai-shek bandits and special agents are all hiding. The masses hate them and hope that we will conduct a thorough investigation of each village to arrest the bad elements and detain the landlords and rich peasants, so that they don't run away." So I decided to seize the opportunity to wipe out all the bad elements in the county and issued instructions to complete it within a time limit. Each district, based on the opinions of a few people or those seeking revenge, without analysis, arrested people indiscriminately, causing the masses to be panic-stricken, and doubts arose about the Party's policies. Many fled, causing great harm.
    Work delays, such as discovering that cadres beat people, cannot be dealt with in a timely manner. Hearing one-sided appeals from cadres, I even thought that the cadres were well-intentioned, and the beaten person was too bad and deserved to be beaten. When the beaten person came to complain, I would say that I would investigate and resolve it later, and then put it aside. Sometimes I found some problems, such as infringing on middle peasants, village cadres' corruption and waste, etc., and I felt that the cadres had limited ability, rural problems were complex, and some problems were unavoidable, so I delayed and did not actively solve them. Lacking enthusiasm for directly taking responsibility for the daily life of the people.
    (3) Patriarchal replacement and taking over everything, and also liking to show off. For example, when going to a district to help with work, I would like to take the lead and give a speech at large and small mass meetings, unwilling to do arduous investigation and research work. I would arbitrarily direct cadres who I had personally promoted or were familiar with, even treating them as my orderlies. I would be incompatible with cadres transferred from other districts, not cultivate cadres, and cause great losses to work.
    In short, rural-style bureaucratism, as it manifests in me, is emphasizing the decentralized and difficult rural environment, and limiting myself to narrow circles, cutting off the organic whole, doing work in a handicraft style, not being able to use organizational power, not being able to focus on the long-term interests of the masses, starting from narrow individualism, sticking to old ways and cutting myself off from the masses, and still being self-righteous.
    The above issues are only my preliminary self-criticism, and I hope to receive corrections during everyone's discussion.

### 我的农村式的官僚主义表现在哪里？

　　我的农村式的官僚主义表现在哪里？
    汪玉
    什么是农村式的官僚主义？联系我自己的工作，我的认识是这样：
    （一）借口农村环境散漫迟缓而原谅自己迁就错误。如召开干部会议，被召集的人无故迟到，影响会议进行，浪费时间而不给以批评，反认为地方干部总不能象军队一样正规。规定了干部请假制度，有些区干部仍时常偷偷回家，影响工作很大，但我认为地方干部就是这样子，也不给以批评就放松过去。
    （二）工作潦草拖延，过去我到下边去检查工作，一天跑三、四个区，有一个大概的轮廓，回机关就决定问题下指示。给我印象最深的是去年刘邓大军南下时，寿张县境收复，听少数区村干部反映：“与蒋匪特勾结的坏分子都潜藏了，群众恨他们，希望我们向各村进行清查拘捕坏分子，并把地富也一律扣压起来，以免他们跑掉”。就决定抓紧机会要把全县坏分子一网打尽，下指示限期完成。各区就根据少数或报复分子的意见，不加分析的，乱抓一气，闹的群众惶惶不安，对党的政策发生了怀疑，逃亡了很多，危害极大。
    工作拖延，如发现干部打人，不能及时处理，听到干部一面的申诉，甚至认为干部是好心肠，被打的人太坏该打。被打的人来控诉，说一声调查后解决，就搁置一边。有时发现一些问题，如侵犯中农、村干贪污浪费等，就觉得干部能力有限，农村问题复杂，出点问题是不可避免的，就拖延下去不积极解决。缺乏直接对人民日常生活负责的热情。
    （三）家长式的代替包办，还好出风头。如到区帮助工作，召开大小群众会议都愿出头讲一套，不愿作艰苦的调查研究工作，对我自己亲手提拔或熟悉的干部，随便支配，甚至当做自己的勤务员。对从外区调来的干部就格格不入，不会培养干部，对工作损失很大。
    总之农村式的官僚主义，表现于我是强调农村环境分散困难，而局限于狭小的圈套，割裂开有机的整体，手工业式的搞工作，不会运用组织力量，不能从长远的群众利益着眼，从狭小的个人主义出发，固步自封脱离群众，还自以为是。
    以上问题只是个人的初步检讨，希望在大家讨论中得到指正。
