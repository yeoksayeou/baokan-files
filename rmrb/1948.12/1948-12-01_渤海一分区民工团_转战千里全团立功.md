Xinhua News Agency, East China, 24th. The military labor corps of the First Military Subdistrict of the Bo Hai District in Shandong (administering Nanpi, Dongguang, Leling, etc.), serving with a certain column of the East China Field Army, gloriously demobilized on October 25th after traversing over a thousand miles and lasting seven months. This labor corps went through battles such as Yanzhou, Sishui, Qufu, and Zou County, and successfully completed all tasks of transferring wounded soldiers and transporting combat materials and supplies. All of the corps' more than two thousand five hundred members received merit, and thirty-four units of squads and platoons were awarded collective merit, receiving thirty-four prize banners. The third platoon of the fifth company of the second battalion of this labor corps once braved enemy fire in the rain and transported sixty-four wounded soldiers back and forth in eight hours, earning a large banner of "Lightning-Fast Transfer," and was rated as a first-class platoon during the corps' merit evaluation. The ninth squad of the first company of the first battalion once transported supplies for six round trips in two days and one night on a sixty-mile journey. At that time, there were many sick soldiers in the squad, but the entire squad responded to the superior's call to reduce personnel but not reduce the number of stretchers, implementing two people carrying one stretcher. No one in the squad violated mass discipline. When the whole squad stayed in civilian houses, they all followed the "three don'ts" rule, namely: don't leave without returning borrowed items, don't leave without filling the landlord's water tank, and don't leave without sweeping the floor clean. The whole squad was able to save resources, picking up firewood on their own whenever they had time, and only collected public firewood for one month out of three months. The squad was rated as a special-class squad during the merit evaluation and awarded a prize banner of "Crown of the Entire Corps" by the political department of the column. Sun Bao Xiang, a Communist Party member from the first platoon of the second company of the first battalion, always ran back and forth around the team during each march, helping the team members carry things, and he carried a heavy load each time. Once, he bought seven fortresses and eight eggs because he was sick. After cooking them, he was reluctant to eat them himself and gave them all to comfort the wounded soldiers. This time, when the corps demobilized, the column specially sent a letter to commend them for always maintaining a high degree of enthusiasm and overcoming difficulties.

　　The main reasons why this labor corps achieved these results were: (1) The cadres and laborers had a high level of class consciousness. Every time they marched to areas severely devastated by the Chiang bandits, the entire corps would conduct planned and organized visits to residents to inquire about their suffering and disasters, using actual materials to educate everyone and inspire the laborers' determination to destroy Chiang and avenge their grievances. The corps often carried out "four comparisons" education (namely, comparing with the people in the Chiang-controlled areas, comparing with the soldiers, comparing with the wounded soldiers, and comparing with themselves before they were liberated) to raise awareness. (2) The bravery and invincibility of the troops in combat gave the corps great encouragement. (3) The entire corps launched a warm-hearted merit-earning campaign, and model squads, platoons, or individuals were praised and publicized on wall newspapers or at large meetings at any time. (4) All the cadres in the corps were able to go deep into the squads and platoons, sharing the joys and hardships of the laborers. Cadres from the squads and platoons up to the battalion and regimental levels often participated in carrying stretchers. Other factors, such as the medical staff's kind care for the laborers and the laborers' families often writing letters to comfort and encourage them, all played a significant role in the laborers' consistent and active service with the army.

　　渤海一分区民工团
  　转战千里全团立功
    【新华社华东二十四日电】山东渤海区一分区（辖南皮、东光、乐陵等）的随军民工团，随华东野战军某纵队服务，辗转千余里，历时七个月，已于十月二十五日光荣复员。该民工团历经兖州、泗水、曲阜、邹县等战役，对转运伤员与运送作战物资、被服等任务，无不胜利完成。全团二千五百余人都立了功，并有三十四个单位班、排立了集体功，获得奖旗三十四面。该民工团二营五连第三排，曾冒雨在敌人炮火下于八小时内往返转运了六十四个伤员，获得“转运神速”的大旗一面，全团评功时被评为一等排。一营一连第九班，曾在六十里路程的运送中，于两天一夜往返六趟。当时该班病号较多，但全班响应上级减员不减担架的号召，实行两人抬一付担架。该班无一人违犯群众纪律。全班借住民房时都做到“三不走”的规定，即：借物不还不走，不挑满房东水缸不走，地扫不净不走。全班均能节约，有暇即自行拾柴，三个月中只领公柴一个月。评功时该班被评为特等班，获得纵队政治部“全团之冠”的奖旗。一营二连一排是孙宝香，共产党员，在每次行军中总围着队伍来回跑，帮队员挑东西，每次行军他都挑得很重。一次，他因生病而买了七堡八个鸡蛋，煮熟后自己舍不得吃，全部慰劳了伤员。此次该团复员，纵队特专函表扬他们始终保持高度积极性和克服困难的精神。
    该民工团获得这些成绩，主要由于：（一）干部、民工阶级觉悟高。每行军至蒋匪摧残严重地区，全团即有计划有组织地向居民访苦访灾，以实际材料教育大家，激发民工们灭蒋复仇的决心。该团常常进行“四比”教育（即与蒋区人民比，与战士比，与伤员比，与自己翻身以前比），以提高觉悟。（二）部队作战的英勇与战无不胜，攻无不克的胜利，给该团以极大鼓舞。（三）全团开展了热烈的立功运动，模范班、排或个人都随时获得墙报或大会的表扬传播。（四）全团干部能深入班排，与民工共甘苦，自班排以至营团级干部均常参加抬担架。其他如医务人员对民工照顾亲切，民工家中常写信来安慰鼓励等，都对该团民工始终如一地积极随军服务作用甚大。
