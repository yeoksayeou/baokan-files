All Kuomintang troops must make a choice: a glorious uprising and laying down their arms, or complete annihilation. We welcome all Kuomintang troops, regardless of their past, as long as they suddenly awaken, revolt, and join the People's Liberation Army." Director Shu earnestly hoped that the two armies, under the leadership of the Communist Party, would strengthen political work, intensify the study of Mao Zedong Thought, and strive to transform the troops into an army that serves the people. Generals He and Zhang delivered speeches in reply. They were proud that their armies could join the big family of the people's democratic revolution. They deeply hoped that the Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army would provide more assistance and guidance, and expressed their determination and confidence in transforming the troops into a people's army. General Zhang Kexia also stated: This glorious righteous act is not their achievement, but the result of years of hard revolutionary work by all revolutionary comrades and millions of awakened people. The influence of this revolutionary victory prompted the awakening and uprising of the troops.
