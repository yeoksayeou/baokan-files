    Regarding the Provisions on the Authority and Responsibility of County and City Public Security and Judicial Organs in Handling Criminal Cases
    [Our Dispatch] The North China People's Government issued the following provisions on the authority and responsibility of county and city public security organs and judicial organs in handling criminal cases on November 30:
    Recently, it has been reported that the judicial organs and public security organs in various counties and cities, due to unclear division of authority and responsibility in handling criminal cases, inevitably have differing opinions, which affects the progress of work. To clarify responsibilities, the following provisions are made:
    The responsibility for investigating cases such as those involving traitors, spies, and war criminals of the civil war should belong to the public security organs. The main task of the investigation is to: collect the criminal facts and evidence of the criminals, and prepare for prosecution. If it is discovered that someone has committed a crime or is indeed suspected of a crime, an investigation and pursuit can be carried out, and a public prosecution can be filed with the judicial organs. If the investigation results indicate insufficient suspicion, or that the act does not constitute a crime, or even if it is a crime but it is appropriate not to prosecute, the public security organs have the right to release the suspect and not prosecute, and the judicial side cannot interfere.
    After the aforementioned cases are prosecuted by the public security organs to the judicial organs, the judicial organs have the authority and responsibility to try the case, examining and studying the criminal facts and evidence of the defendant, to see if the defendant has committed a crime, what crime has been committed, and what punishment should be imposed, and then make a judgment and announce it. During the trial process of the judicial organs, the public security organs can pursue the case and put forward opinions, but the judicial side can adopt or reject them. The public security organs can appeal if they have different opinions regarding the determination of the defendant's guilt or innocence, or the severity of the sentence. The public security side is responsible for prosecuting crimes, so those suspected of crimes can be prosecuted even if the evidence is not necessarily conclusive. The judicial side, however, is responsible for judging crimes and imposing punishments. If the defendant is only suspected and there is no active evidence to prove that the defendant has indeed committed a crime, then they cannot be convicted and punished.
    As for ordinary criminal cases (excluding violations of police regulations), when the public security organs are aware of a criminal suspect, they also have the authority and responsibility to take urgent and necessary measures and transfer the case to the judicial organs for handling.

    关于县市公安与司法机关处理刑事案件权责的规定
    【本报讯】华北人民政府十一月三十日发布关于县市公安机关与司法机关处理刑事案件权责的规定如下：
    近据反映，各县市司法机关与公安机关对于处理刑事案件，由于权责不甚清楚，难免发生纷歧的意见，致影响工作的进行，为明确职责，特作如下规定：
    关于汉奸特务及内战罪犯等案件，其侦查的责任，应属于公安机关。侦查的主要任务是：搜集罪犯的犯罪事实及证据，拟以起诉，如发现某人犯罪或确系有犯罪嫌疑，即可加以侦查追究，并向司法机关提起公诉；假如侦查的结果嫌疑不足，或其行为不成立犯罪等，再则纵系犯罪，而以不起诉为适当时，则公安机关均有权释放，不予起诉，司法方面，不能干涉。
    前述案件，经公安机关向司法机关起诉后，司法机关即有权责审判该案，对于被告的犯罪事实和证据，加以审理研究，看被告是否犯罪？所犯何罪？应该科什么刑？然后加以裁判，宣示。公安机关在司法机关审理过程中，既可追诉，并可提出意见，但司法方面采纳与否，对于被告认定犯罪或无罪，科刑或重或轻，公安机关如有不同意见可以上诉。公安方面职在追诉犯罪，故对有犯罪嫌疑者，不一定证据确凿，即可起诉；而司法方面是论罪科刑，若被告仅有嫌疑，没有积极的证据可以证明被告确系犯罪时，即不能论罪科刑。
    至于普通刑事案件（除违警罚法外），公安机关知有犯罪嫌疑时，亦有权责为紧急与必要的措施，移交司法机关处理。
