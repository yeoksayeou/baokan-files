　　The Ruhr Question

    The Ruhr is located in western Germany, close to the German-Dutch border. It is Germany's most important industrial region and the main base of its military industry. According to the 1939 statistics, the population of this area was about seven million. The main industrial cities in the Ruhr area are Essen, Düsseldorf, and Dortmund. The famous Krupp arms factory and Germany's largest arms factory, "Deutsche Werke," are both located in the Ruhr.

    The Ruhr is rich in coal and iron. Its coal production accounts for 70% of Germany's total, and its steel production accounts for 60% of Germany's total. Before the war, the Ruhr's annual coal production was 127 million tons, of which 5 million to 10 million tons were used for export each year. The Ruhr's pig iron production averaged 11 million tons per year before the war (reaching a maximum of 13 million tons), which was equivalent to the entire British Empire's production; steel production averaged 14 million tons per year before the war (reaching a maximum of 16 million tons), which was twice that of France. Under these circumstances, the question of how to control the Ruhr's industry in order to prevent the revival of Nazi Germany became one of the most important issues in the post-war handling of Germany. The principles of the Yalta and Potsdam decisions were to eliminate or control all German industries that could be used for war purposes. At the Potsdam Conference, the Soviet Union proposed the joint management of the Ruhr by the four powers: the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France. In the subsequent four-power foreign ministers' meetings on the handling of Germany, the Soviet Union repeatedly raised this issue. In June of this year, the foreign ministers of eight countries, including the Soviet Union, Poland, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, and Albania, issued a declaration at a meeting held in Warsaw stating: "Only by transferring the Ruhr's heavy industry to the hands of the German people and determining that the four powers should control the production and distribution of the Ruhr's industrial products for a certain period of time (the four powers acting in unison is the only guarantee that the Ruhr's industry will only develop for peaceful purposes) can the Ruhr issue be resolved in accordance with the interests of the peace and security of the European people." However, the U.S. imperialists intend to use the Ruhr as a base for preparing for a new war. They colluded with Britain and France and repeatedly rejected the proposals of the Soviet Union and the new democratic countries. They secretly resolved the Ruhr issue according to their own policies behind the back of the Soviet Union. The convening of the London Six-Power Ruhr Conference is one example. Although there have been many bargaining disputes between Britain, France, and the United States on the production and distribution of Ruhr industry, this is because the British and French reactionaries fear popular opposition and are also unwilling to completely give up Ruhr coal and iron. However, the British and French reactionaries rely so much on the United States that when the United States threatens to "stop aid," they have to yield to the United States on the Ruhr issue time and time again. Although the Ruhr still belongs to the British occupation zone, since Britain handed over the management rights of the Ruhr industry to the United States at the U.S.-British Washington Ruhr Conference last August, the United States has actually become the master of the Ruhr.

### 鲁尔问题

　　鲁尔问题
    鲁尔位于德国的西部，靠近德荷边境。它是德国最重要的工业地区和军事工业的主要根据地。这一区域的人口，据一九三九年的统计，约七百万人。鲁尔区的主要工业城市，有埃森、杜塞尔多夫、多特蒙德等。著名的克虏伯军火工厂和德国最大的军火工厂“德意志工厂”都在鲁尔。
    鲁尔盛产煤铁。它的煤产量占全德的百分之七十，钢铁产量占全德的百分之六十。战前，鲁尔每年的煤产量为一亿二千七百万吨，其中用作输出的每年达五百万至一千万吨。鲁尔的生铁产量，战前每年平均为一千一百万吨（最高时达到一千三百万吨），约等于整个英帝国的生产；钢产量战前每年平均为一千四百万吨（最高时达到一千六百万吨），比法国大两倍。在这种情况下，如何管制鲁尔的工业借以防止纳粹德国复活的问题，就成为战后处理德国的最重要问题之一。雅尔塔和波茨顿决定的原则是：消灭或控制可能供作战目的之用的一切德国工业。在波茨顿会议上，苏联提出了由苏、美、英、法四强共管鲁尔的问题。在其后几次有关处理德国问题的四强外长会议上，苏联曾再次地提出这一问题。今年六月，苏、波、保、罗、匈、捷、南、阿尔巴尼亚等八国外长在华沙所举行的会议又发表宣言称：“只有将鲁尔重工业转入德国人民之手，并确定在一定时间内由四强管制鲁尔工业出品的生产与分配（四强共同一致是能保证鲁尔工业只为和平目的而发展的），才有可能根据欧洲人民的和平与安全的利益来解决鲁尔问题”。但是，美帝国主义者却打算把鲁尔作为其准备新战争的基地，它拉拢英法在一起，一再地拒绝了苏联和新民主国家的建议。他们背着苏联根据他们自己的政策私下地解决鲁尔问题。伦敦六国鲁尔会议的召开即其一例。虽然，在鲁尔工业的生产和分配问题上，英、法与美国之间，曾发生过许多讨价还价的争吵，这是因为英、法反动派害怕人民反对以及它们亦不愿完全放弃鲁尔煤铁的缘故。但是，英、法反动派又如此投靠着美国，因此，当美国以“停止援助”相要胁时，它们不得不在鲁尔问题上一次又一次地向美国屈服了。鲁尔现在虽仍属英占区，但自英国在去年八月美英华盛顿鲁尔会议上把鲁尔工业的管理权交给了美国以后，美国已实际上成为鲁尔的主人。
