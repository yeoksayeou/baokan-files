Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 19th: TASS, Paris, 15th: Twenty-two imprisoned miners from Chalence in northeastern France recently sent a telegram to the "Great and Glorious Miners' Union" expressing their respect, stating: We salute the Miners' Union and thank it for all it has done for the working miners. We salute it and, as always, trust it to lead the miners along the path of glory, freedom, and happiness. We are imprisoned for defending our own bread and the bread of our children. We are awaiting sentencing and will bear it with our heads held high. The cruel retribution we have suffered cannot break our will to struggle and act resolutely. We have maintained our fighting spirit. We guarantee to continue our cause in order to achieve the full prosperity of our mines, the welfare and happiness of the people, and the independence of our motherland. We are convinced that the struggle is continuing everywhere, and that after regrouping their forces, the miners will win all that they demand.

　　被监禁的法国矿工坚决表示斗争到底
    【新华社陕北十九日电】塔斯社巴黎十五日讯：法国东北部察伦斯的二十二个被监禁的矿工，顷电“伟大荣耀的矿工联盟”致敬称：我们向矿工联盟致敬，并对它为劳动矿工所作的一切致谢。我们向它致敬，并象从来那样，信托它领导矿工沿着光荣、自由与幸福的道路前进。我们因为保卫我们自己的面包和我们儿女的面包而被监禁。我们正在等候判决，我们将傲然昂首地承当它。我们所受的残酷报复，破裂不了我们斗争与坚决行动的意志。我们保持了我们的战斗精神。我们保证继续我们的事业，以求达到我们矿山的充分繁荣，人民的福利、幸福和祖国的独立。我们确信：到处正在继续斗争，而且，在重新集聚其力量之后，矿工们将赢得他们所要求的一切。
