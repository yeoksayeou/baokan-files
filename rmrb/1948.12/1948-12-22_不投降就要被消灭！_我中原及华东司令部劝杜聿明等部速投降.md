　　Surrender or Be Eliminated!
    Headquarters of the Central Plains and East China Urge Du Yuming and His Troops to Surrender Quickly
    [Xinhua News Agency, Huaihai Front, 17th] The Headquarters of the Central Plains and East China of the People's Liberation Army today issued a letter of persuasion to surrender to the Kuomintang generals Du Yuming, Qiu Qingquan, and Li Mi. The original text is as follows:
    General Du Yuming, General Qiu Qingquan, General Li Mi, and all army, division, and regiment commanders of the Qiu and Li Corps:
    You have now reached the end of your rope. The Huang Wei Corps was completely annihilated on the evening of the 15th, and the Li Yannian Corps has turned south to flee. There is no hope for you to join them. Do you want to break through? The People's Liberation Army is all around. How can you break through? What have been the results of your attempts to break through these past few days? Your planes and tanks are also useless. We have more planes and tanks than you. These are cannons and explosives. People call them indigenous airplanes and indigenous tanks. Aren't they ten times more powerful than your foreign airplanes and foreign tanks? Your Sun Yuanliang Corps is finished, and the remaining two corps have also suffered more than half casualties and captures. Although you have forcibly incorporated many office idlers and young students brought from Xuzhou into the army, how can these people fight? In the past ten days, under our layers of encirclement and heavy blows, your positions have shrunk. You only have a small area of ​​more than a dozen li in length and width. With so many people crowded together, one of our shells can kill a pile of you. Your wounded soldiers and accompanying family members are crying out in agony. Your soldiers and many cadres do not want to fight anymore. You who are deputy commanders-in-chief, corps commanders, army, division, and regiment commanders should cherish the feelings of your subordinates and their families, cherish their lives, and find a way out for them as soon as possible. Don't let them make unnecessary sacrifices anymore.
    Now that Huang Wei has been annihilated in Shuangduiji, and Li Yannian is fleeing to Bengbu, we can concentrate several times our strength to fight you. In this campaign, which has only lasted forty days, you have already lost Huang Botao's ten divisions, Huang Wei's eleven divisions, Sun Yuanliang's four divisions, Feng Zhi'an's four divisions, Sun Liangcheng's two divisions, Liu Ruming's one division, Su County's one division, and Lingbi's one division. In total, you have lost thirty-four full divisions. Among them, except for He Jifeng and Zhang Kexia who led three and a half divisions in uprising, Liao Yunzhou who led one division in uprising, Sun Liangcheng who led one division in surrender, and Zhao Biguang and Huang Zihua who each led half a division in surrender, the remaining twenty-seven and a half divisions have been completely annihilated by our army. You have already seen with your own eyes the fate of the Huang Botao Corps, the Huang Wei Corps, and the Sun Yuanliang Corps. You should learn from the example of General Zheng Dongguo in Changchun, and learn from the examples of Army Commander Sun Liangcheng, Division Commander Zhao Biguang, and Division Commander Huang Zihua this time. Immediately order the entire army to lay down their weapons and stop resisting. Our army can guarantee the safety of the lives of your senior generals and all officers and soldiers. Only in this way is your only way out. Think about it. If you think this is good, then do it. If you still want to fight, then fight, but you will eventually be resolved.

　　不投降就要被消灭！
    我中原及华东司令部劝杜聿明等部速投降
    【新华社淮海前线十七日电】人民解放军中原和华东两司令部本日发出对杜聿明邱清泉李弥诸国民党将领的劝降书。原文如下：
    杜聿明将军、邱清泉将军、李弥将军，和邱李两兵团诸位军长师长团长们：
    你们现在已经到了山穷水尽的地步。黄维兵团已在十五日晚全军覆没，李延年兵团已掉头南逃，你们想和他们靠拢是没有希望了。你们想突围吗？四面八方都是解放军，怎么突得出去呢？你们这几天试着突围，有什么结果呢？你们的飞机坦克也没有用，我们的飞机坦克比你们多，这就是大炮和炸药，人们叫这些做土飞机，土坦克，难道不是比较你们的洋飞机洋坦克要厉害十倍吗？你们的孙元良兵团已经完了，剩下你们两个兵团，也已伤俘过半。你们虽然把徐州带来的许多机关闲杂人员和青年学生，强迫他们编入部队，这些人怎么能打仗呢？十几天来，在我们的层层包围和重重打击之下，你们的阵地是缩小了，你们只有那么一点地方，横直不过十几华里，这样多人挤在一起，我们一颗炮弹，就能打死你们一堆人。你们的伤兵和随军家属，跟着你们叫苦连天。你们的兵士和很多干部大家很不想打了。你们当副总司令的，当兵团司令的，当军长师长团长的，应当体惜你们的部下和家属的心情，爱惜他们的生命，早一点替他们找一条生路，别再叫他们作无谓的牺牲了。
    现在黄维在双堆集被歼灭，李延年向蚌埠逃跑，我们可以集中几倍于你们的兵力来打你们。我们此次作战才四十天，你们方面已经丧失了黄伯韬十个师，黄维十一个师，孙元良四个师，冯治安四个师，孙良诚两个师，刘汝明一个师，宿县一个师，灵璧一个师，你们总共丧失了三十四个整师。其中除何基沣，张克侠率三个半师起义，廖运周率一个师起义，孙良诚率一个师投诚，赵璧光，黄子华各率半个师投诚以外，其余二十七个半师，都被本军全部歼灭了。黄伯韬兵团，黄维兵团和孙元良兵团的下场，你们已经亲眼看到了。你们应当学习长春郑洞国将军的榜样，学习此次孙良诚军长、赵璧光师长、黄子华师长的榜样，立即下令全军放下武器，停止抵抗，本军可以保证你们高级将领和全体官兵的生命安全。只有这样，才是你们的唯一生路，你们想一想罢，如果你们觉得这样好，就这样办。如果你们还想打一下，那就再打一下，总归你们是要被解决的。
