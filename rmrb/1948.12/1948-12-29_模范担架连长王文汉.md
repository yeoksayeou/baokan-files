　　Model Stretcher-Bearer Company Commander Wang Wenhan
    Tian Su
    As soon as you meet Wenhan, you will quickly get the impression that "this is an honest and kind person." He has unspoken principles in his heart, but they are very clearly demonstrated in his actions. His principle in dealing with fellow villagers is "I would rather suffer a little myself than let others suffer."

    Wang Wenhan is twenty-nine years old this year. He has been working in the village since 1939, serving as a model team leader, director of the Armed Forces Committee, and village chief, and has waged arduous struggles against the enemy.

    During the battle to liberate Zhengding, he participated in the support-the-front work. Subsequently, he participated in seven campaigns including the North of Daqing River, North of Baoding, Qingfengdian, Shijiazhuang, the Winter Campaign, North of Baoding again, and Chahar South, continuously for about a year. He was hardworking, brave, and always led by example, day in and day out.

　　He Cares for His Team Members Meticulously, Infinitely Loyal to His Work
    Zhang Gou'dan from Bian Xin Zhuang was very backward in the past. When he joined the stretcher team, he didn't want to go. When they set off from Anguo, he asked to go home, so Wenhan patiently explained to him. When Gou'dan got sick, he used his own money to buy him things to eat. When rescuing on the front line, Wenhan instructed him: "You have to show your strength on the battlefield, to let others see what kind of people we are. It is very glorious to perform meritorious service on the front line." Later, Gou'dan carried the wounded bare-chested.

    Ji Guorui was a platoon leader, carefree and irresponsible, and not proactive in performing his duties, lacking planning. Wenhan told him that cadres should lead by example and always think of the team members. Later, Ji Guorui's platoon became a model platoon.

    Wenhan's education for the team members was very practical. He taught the team members how to defend against artillery and airplanes. When artillery shells come, walk towards them, don't walk to the sides. Most of the civilian stretcher-bearers go to the dressing stations, and even if they go to the front line, they are not afraid as long as they listen to the command and obey the orders, and the cadres lead the way. He patiently explained and educated those who wanted to desert, saying: "The troops are suffering much more than us. We young adults have a responsibility to support the war. Suffering a little bit doesn't matter!" Some worried about family production and feared that the village cadres would not take good care of them. Wenhan said: "The village cadres will definitely take care of us, but we are just family members of civilian workers, can we be better than the family members of soldiers?" He often asked those who only shouted bravery but dared not rescue on the front line to fulfill their past promises.

    Chen Jinyin was sick, in low spirits, and wanted to go home. Wenhan checked on him six or seven times in one night, and bought him five thousand yuan worth of eggs, dispelling his desire to go home. He helped them carry things when marching, and when the team members didn't have enough clothes to wear, he would rather be cold himself to take care of the team members. Once, during a forced march to climb a big mountain, they couldn't get food, and the team members were very tired, hungry, and thirsty. Wenhan ran more than two miles to fetch water for the team members to drink. When crossing the Forty-Five Ridge, he helped the cooks carry big pots and pick up oil drums. When crossing the Dana River in Liulinzhuang at night, he carried Wang Ruqi and two others across the river on his back. Chen Luoman, who worked in the kitchen, was emotionally unstable. After Wenhan carried him across the river, he used his new sheepskin towel to wipe his feet and put on his socks. Old Man said: "The company commander is really good!" From then on, he was moved.

    Every time they garrisoned, they always settled the team members first before resting themselves, and watched over the air defense area. When there were few houses, they camped out, checking the beds all night long, covering this one and that one. They always let the team members live in the houses first, and slept outside themselves if there were no houses. Now, Wenhan's joints ache after sleeping for half a night, but he has no complaints or expresses his merits at all.

    When it was cold and there was a shortage of clothing, Wenhan launched a straw-clothing weaving campaign. After weaving the straw into straw clothes, they were windproof, cold-proof, and rain-proof, solving the problem of cold. This encouraged people's fighting spirit.

    Because of this, the team members supported him very much and didn't hide anything from him.

    Brave and Resourceful, Treats the Wounded Like Brothers
    Every time they went to the front line for rescue, Wenhan led the way. During the battle of Shixia, the wounded had to be carried to the rear across two rivers. He led two stretchers at the front, placing six stretchers every few miles across the river, nine stretchers specifically for crossing the river, and another nine stretchers on the other side of the river, so that fewer people would be exposed and losses would be minimized. Others carried once and changed shifts, but Wenhan carried five times. The soldiers applauded and cheered, and the political director of the unit personally brought them food and soup.

    In order to defend against air raids and artillery fire and carry the wounded quickly, Wenhan and his team studied how to make one stretcher do the work of two, changing from four people carrying to two people carrying. They arranged the stretchers in a long snake formation, with one stretcher every few miles, relaying the wounded down the line. During the battle of Jiaobaozi, Wenhan led a platoon to the front line for rescue, and he personally carried comrades Fan Yiming and Lü Jindan on his back. He climbed two mountains back and forth for more than 110 miles in one night. Although he was so tired that he vomited blood, he never complained. During the Huai'an battle, he led another platoon to the front line on Dali Mountain north of the city for rescue. When the enemy's gunfire and charge sounds were close, he calmly helped the team members carry the wounded, passing through the enemy's fire blockade and completing the rescue mission.

    During the march from Fangnian Village in Yuxian County, a wounded soldier was riding a donkey, and the shaking made his wound unbearably painful. Wenhan carried him on his back for more than two miles to the sanatorium. Before each mission, he would buy eggs, cigarettes, and candy to comfort the wounded. He also wiped the wounded's feces and urine and wiped the wounded's blood with his own towel.

    Leaves a Good Reputation Everywhere
    Because of Wenhan's resolute and courageous performance of his duties, he has won the praise of the troops. Wenhan once personally carried an injured political instructor on his back. After he recovered, he would ask about the whereabouts of Company Commander Wang wherever he saw a stretcher, insisting on taking out money to慰劳 the civilian workers. Once, when they were about to perform a mission, the regiment didn't know which unit's stretchers were assigned. Director Zhu of the political department thought of going to the stretcher team to do some mobilization. As soon as he saw Wenhan, he said: "If it's your stretchers, I won't go, there's no need to mobilize." The stretcher team and the soldiers also got along very well. The soldiers gave the civilian workers clothes to wear, and the health clinic gave them priority when they were sick. Whenever the Anguo Stretcher Third Company was mentioned, the troops were especially welcome.

    In the gaps between missions, they also helped the masses with production and visited the poor. When they lived in Longmen Village in Laishui County, they chopped more than 3,000 catties of firewood and carried manure to repair walls for the landlords Wang Quancai and Wang Wenxi. The grateful landlords gave them vegetables to eat and wrote letters to the regiment headquarters to commend them. When they lived in Beishangou Village in Sihaixian County, Wenhan called on the entire company to eat half a bowl of rice less per person, saving twenty-eight catties of millet to help five poor families. The grateful villagers wrote letters to the regiment headquarters to express their gratitude. In Chadao West Village, they motivated Tiger and Lao Xu to make spinning wheels for the people and taught two little girls how to spin thread. Wherever the Anguo Stretcher Third Company has lived, it has received enthusiastic support from the masses and left a good reputation.

　　模范担架连长王文汉
    田苏
    你只要见到文汉，很快会给你一个印象“这是个忠厚老实人”，心里有说不出来，但行动上却表现得非常明显，他对待乡亲们的原则是“宁自己吃点亏不让别人吃亏”。
    王文汉今年二十九岁，从民国二十八年就在村里参加工作，曾担任模范队长、武委会主任、村长等职，与敌人进行过艰苦的斗争。
    解放正定之役，他就参加了支前工作，相继又参加大清河北、保北、清风店、石家庄、冬季、保北、察南等七次战役，连续一年左右，艰苦勇敢，处处以身作则，一年来如一日。
　　爱护队员无微不至，对工作无限忠心
    边新庄张狗旦过去很落后，参加担架队的时候就不愿去，在安国出发时，还要求回家要他耐心的给狗旦解释。狗旦病了，他用自己的钱给他买东西吃。到火线抢救时，文汉嘱咐他：“要在战场上卖一膀子，究竟叫别人看看咱们是个什么人，在火线上立功是非常光荣的”。以后狗旦光着膀子抬伤员。
    纪国瑞是个排长，吊儿浪当，执行工作不积极，计划性差。文汉告诉他干部要以身作则，处处为队员着想，以后纪国瑞排，成了个模范排。
    文汉对队员的教育非常实际。教队员们如何防炮，防飞机。炮弹来了，迎着走，不要往两边走。民工担架多半是到绑扎所，即便到火线上去，听指挥服从命令干部领着头也不怕。对想开小差的耐心解释教育，他说：“部队比我们苦的多，我们青壮年有责任支援战争，受点罪算不了什么！”有的顾虑家庭生产，怕村干部照顾的不好。文汉说：“村干部一定会照顾我们，可是我们才是个民工家属，还能超过抗属吗？”对只是嘴里喊勇敢，不敢到火线抢救的人，他常常要求他们实行过去所表明的诺言。
    陈金印病了，情绪不高，想回家。文汉一宿看了他六、七趟，又给他买了五千元的鸡蛋，打消了他想回家的心意。行军时帮助他们背东西，队员们衣服不够穿，宁自己挨冻，也照顾队员。有一次急行军爬大山吃不着饭，队员们非常疲劳，又饥又渴，文汉跑出二里多地，给队员们打水喝。过四十五岭时，帮火房背大锅、挑油桶。夜渡柳林庄大南河，背王儒棋等三人过河。伙房陈洛满情绪不稳定，文汉把他背过河去以后，用自己的新羊肚手巾给他擦脚，给他穿上袜子。老满说：“连长真好！”从此感化了他。
    每次驻防都是先安置下队员，自己才休息，并看好防空区。房子少露营，一夜不断查铺，给这个盖给那个盖，有房先尽队员住，无房自己在外面睡。现在文汉每睡过半夜以后，骨节发疼，但他没有丝毫的怨言和表示自己的功劳。
    天冷缺衣，文汉发起编草衣运动，用草编成草衣以后，又遮风又遮寒，又遮雨，解决了冷的问题。鼓励了人们的斗志。
    正因为这样，队员们也就非常拥护他，有什么话也不瞒他。
    有勇有谋对伤兵如亲兄弟
    每次到火线抢救，都是文汉前头带路。在石匣战斗时，要把伤员抬到隔两道河的后方去。他带着两付担架在最前面，隔河数里放六付，九付专门过河，河那边又是九付，这样来回人少不容易受损失。别人担一次一换班，文汉一直担了五次，战士鼓掌叫好，部队上的政治主任亲自给他们送饭汤。
    为了防空防炮抬的快，文汉他们曾研究，一付担架如何顶两付使，四人抬变作二人抬。把担架摆成一个长蛇阵，每隔里数地一付，接运下去。在交堡子战斗时文汉带一个排到火线抢救，自己还背下了范一明吕金旦二同志，一宿爬了两个山头，来回一百一十多里地，虽累的吐了血，但他总不辞劳苦。怀安战斗又带一个排到城北大里山上火线抢救，当敌人的枪声和冲锋声都近了，他还很沉着的帮助队员们抬伤员，穿过敌之火力封锁线，完成了抢救的任务。
    在蔚县方年村出发的行军中，一伤员骑毛驴，震动的伤口痛疼难忍，文汉背了他二里多地，到休养所里。在每次执行任务之前，就买下鸡子、纸烟、糖，以备慰问伤员。又给伤员擦屎接尿，用自己的手巾给伤员擦血。
    到处留下好名声
    由于文汉执行任务的坚决勇敢，取得部队的赞扬。文汉曾经亲身背过一个受伤的指导员，他恢复健康后，见到担架就打听王连长在什么地方，非要拿出钱来慰劳民工们不可。一次要执行任务，团里不知道分配的是哪部分的担架。政治处朱主任想到担架上进行一下动员，一见到文汉说：“是你们的担架我不去了，用不着动员”。担架队和战士们也打成了一片，战士给民工衣服穿，民工有病卫生所尽先给他们看，一提到安国担架第三连，部队格外欢迎。
    在任务间隙中，他们又帮助群众生产，访苦济贫，住涞水县龙门庄时，给房东王全才、王文秀，劈木柴三千多斤，挑粪修墙，感激的房东给菜吃，向团部写信表扬。住四海县北山沟村时，文汉号召全连每人少吃半碗饭，节约小米二十八斤，赈济了五家贫民。感激的村中给团部写信，表示谢意。在岔道西边村，带动老虎、老许给老百姓做纺车，教会了两个小闺女纺线。凡是安国担架第三连住过的地方，都得到群众的热烈拥护，留下好的名声。
