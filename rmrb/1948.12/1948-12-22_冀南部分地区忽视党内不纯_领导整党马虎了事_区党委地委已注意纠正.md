Southern Hebei Regions Neglect Impurities Within the Party
Leaders Are Careless in Party Rectification
Regional Party Committee and Prefectural Party Committee Have Noticed and Are Correcting

[This newspaper reports] Recently, in some areas of the Fourth District of Southern Hebei, it was discovered that some cadres, proceeding from a right-leaning viewpoint, had a tendency to neglect or even dismiss Party rectification. The District Party Committee and the Prefectural Party Committee have paid attention to this and are using weekly situation reports to correct and prevent it in various places. This tendency manifests itself in the following ways: First, some areas fear that Party rectification will prevent them from completing the land reform task, and some areas believe that Party rectification has "nothing to rectify." In Ningnan County, because some Party members who had made mistakes had their public positions revoked in the past, but their ideological problems were not well resolved, they harbored many grievances and complaints. Therefore, they did not report things like theft and gambling in the villages, and some even stirred up trouble to obstruct the work. Under such circumstances, the Ningnan County Committee believed that Party rectification was only to end land reform, and that if land reform could be ended, the Party did not need to be rectified. They were afraid that if the Party members were rectified too severely, land reform would not be able to be completed, so they decided to put Party rectification after land reform. Cadres in Baixiang generally believed: "The Party has nothing to rectify. Those who made mistakes were already rectified in the spring, and most of the rest have not done any work since the spring, so they have not made any mistakes." However, according to the materials of fifty-eight Party members in the training class run by the Baixiang County Committee, twenty-nine people had committed errors such as beating and detaining people, and harboring landlords. And these Party members were all "good" Party members transferred from various villages, and most of them were prepared to be promoted to district-level cadres. In the work plan of the Pingxiang County Committee, it was stipulated that villages without land reform tasks could only have a representative from the branch report on their work and did not need to rectify the Party. Villages of the land reform type could simply rectify the Party. The Party rectification time for branches with complicated problems should not be too long, and it was said that they should be transferred to supplementary work after a little finishing. Party rectification was treated as an auxiliary task of land reform. Because they were afraid that Party rectification would prevent them from completing the land reform task, Ningnan decided to complete the Party rectification work of a branch in seven days. In the Liu Hongkang and Malutun branches of the Fourth District of Pingxiang, because the cadres leading the Party rectification said "there is nothing," the Party was made public without internal and external deliberation, resulting in most Party members lying down and refusing to work, forming a deadlock. Second, the Party rectification work was sloppy and perfunctory, and the Party members and cadres were treated with unprincipled accommodation. Many cadres in Baixiang believed that the fact that Party members and cadres were lying down was entirely due to being frightened, and the leadership should be responsible. The Ningnan County Committee once decided that Party members could first "pour out their bitterness" at the beginning of Party rectification. Some district cadres in Nangong and Baixiang went to the villages to apologize to the Party members who participated in the Party rectification in the spring, saying: "The Party rectification in the past was wrong," in order to beg the Party members to stand up and work. Nangong Huapen Village supported the Party members to the point where no one dared to gossip on the street, and when they saw that it was not working, they explained the Party rectification policy to the masses, and then the Party members lay down and refused to work again (Editor's note: There is nothing wrong with supporting Party members, the problem is to support good Party members, support correct support, not to support bad Party members and support incorrect support. The Party rectification policy should first be explained to the Party members, and then to the masses). A certain branch in Julu discovered that the majority of its members were composed of puppet soldiers and bandits, but they did not deal with this very well. Third, they were afraid of the masses participating in Party rectification. Zhentang County proposed: "Party problems should be solved within the Party" because they were afraid of public Party rectification. Bianjiazhuang in Ren County did not dare to announce the Party rectification policy to the masses. Zou Tun in Nangong only selected representatives from poor peasants to participate in Party rectification, while in the middle peasants, one-third of the representatives were designated to participate, causing suspicion among the middle peasants. The mass representatives of Houchuan Village did not say a word during the Party rectification, and they did not mobilize or enlighten the representatives, so that the participation of the masses in Party rectification became a formality. In some villages in the Fifth District, because the masses were not mobilized to participate in Party rectification, the Party deliberated for eleven days, and as a result, the Party members did not have any materials to reflect on. In Beichai Village, the mass representatives of the First District of Pingxiang made suggestions to the Party members, and the Party members said that they were retaliatory elements, so they re-elected all the representatives. In Xilizhuang, the First District of Nangong, because the mass representatives made a not completely true suggestion to the Party members, the District Party Secretary made a fuss about it and personally convened a mass meeting to prove that the opinion expressed was wrong. Due to the emergence of the above tendencies, the Party rectification work in these areas has been greatly hindered.

### 冀南部分地区忽视党内不纯　领导整党马虎了事  区党委地委已注意纠正

　　冀南部分地区忽视党内不纯
    领导整党马虎了事
    区党委地委已注意纠正
    【本报讯】全苏幼民报导：冀南四分区部分地区最近在整党工作中，发现若干干部从右的观点出发，产生忽视、甚至取消整党的倾向。区党委与地委已予注意，已利用每周情况通报各地加以纠正和防止。此种倾向表现在：第一、有的地区害怕因整党而完不成土改的任务，有的地区认为整党“没有什么整头”。宁南县因过去撤换了一些犯错误的党员的公开职务，但思想问题并未很好解决，他们存在着许多不满和牢骚，因此村里有小偷、赌博的事情也不报告，有的甚至挑动事非阻碍工作。在这样的情况下，宁南县委却认为整党只是为了结束土改，土改能结束，党不整也行，并害怕把党员整垮了结束不了土改，因此决定把整党放在土改后面。柏乡干部普遍认为：“党没啥整头，犯错误的已经在春天整过了，其余大部分从春天以来就没做什么工作，因此也没错误”。但根据柏乡县委所办的训练班中五十八个党员反省的材料，有二十九人犯过打人扣人、包庇地主等错误。而这些党员还都是由各村调来的“好”党员，多数准备提拔为区级干部的。在平乡县委的工作计划中规定：没有土改任务的村庄，只由支部派一代表报告工作，可以不整党。土改一类村可以简单整一下党。问题复杂的支部整党时间也不要拖得太长，并说稍加整理即转入抽补。把整党作为土改的附属任务。因为怕因整党完不成土改任务，宁南确定要七天完成一个支部的整党工作。平乡四区刘洪康马鲁屯支部，由于领导整党的干部说“没有啥”，未经党内外酝酿就公开了党，结果多数党员躺倒不干形成僵局。第二、对整党工作马虎潦草，对党员干部作无原则的迁就。柏乡有不少干部认为党员干部躺倒完全是吓倒的，应由领导上负责。宁南县委曾决定在整党开始时可先由党员“倒苦水”。南宫、柏乡有的区干部到村先向参加春天整党的党员赔不是说：“过去整党错了”，以此来恳求党员起来工作。南宫花盆村给党员撑腰，撑到群众谁也不敢去街上说闲话了，一看不行就向群众讲整党方针，于是党员又躺倒不干了（编者按：给党员撑腰并没有错，问题是要撑好党员之腰，撑正确之腰，而不要撑坏党员之腰撑错误之腰。整党方针首先要向党员讲清楚，然后再向群众讲）。巨鹿某支部在整党中发现了伪军土匪成份占了多数，对此也不很好进行处理。第三、害怕群众参加整党。振堂县因害怕公开整党而提出：“党内问题党内解决。”任县边家庄不敢把整党方针向群众公布。南宫邹屯只由贫农选代表参加整党，在中农中则指定三分之一代表参加，引起中农怀疑。后陈村群众代表在整党中一言不发，对代表不作动员启发，使群众参加整党流于形式。五区有的村因为不发动群众参加整党，党内酝酿了十一天，结果党员反省没材料。平乡一区北柴村群众代表给党员提了意见，党员说这是报复分子，于是把全体代表另行改选了。南宫一区西李庄因为群众代表给党员提了个不完全真实的意见，区委书记小题大作，亲自召开群众大会来证明发表的意见是错的。由于以上倾向的产生，使这些地区的整党工作受到了很大的阻碍。
