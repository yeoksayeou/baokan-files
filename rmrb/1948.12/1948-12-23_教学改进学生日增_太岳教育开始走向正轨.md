　　Taiyue Electric News: Since the implementation of the educational regularization policy in primary and secondary schools in Taiyue, initial achievements have been made. Students are progressing rapidly, and the number of enrolled students is increasing rapidly. After the administrative office education conference in October, Jin-Yu Middle School earnestly conducted tests and assigned classes according to proficiency. Jincheng No. 3 High School also reorganized classes after testing, promoting those who should be promoted and demoting those who should be demoted. The recruitment of new students went through strict examinations, and teaching methods were gradually improved. Not only are middle schools carrying out education in a planned way, but primary schools have also formulated education plans. For example, Jincheng No. 3 High School used to teach whatever came up and wherever they were. Teachers did not make adequate preparations before class. Now, they have formulated education plans for each semester and the progress of each subject. Teachers make full preparations before class and explain in a planned and purposeful manner. In their spare time, they carefully correct diaries and review calligraphy. In order to improve themselves, teachers also insist on their own learning. Each teacher at No. 3 High School subscribes to a newspaper as material for current affairs study. In addition, there are five hours of professional study each week. In the Huiqing school district of Yangcheng, because the primary schools have formulated practical teaching plans and specific requirements, students generally make rapid progress in their studies. In the first summary of Jin-Yu Middle School (October 25), the diaries of 21 students were published, and 90% of them contained misspelled words, and there were 83 ungrammatical sentences. In the second summary (November 5), the diaries of 24 students showed that the number of misspelled words had been reduced to 40%, and the number of ungrammatical sentences had also been reduced to 61. Fourth-grade students in Beiye can now calculate mixed four arithmetic problems, and the number of students is also increasing rapidly. Jincheng No. 3 High School added 102 new students this winter. In the Beiye school district of Yicheng, the number of male students enrolled in the entire school district used to be 254, and the number of female students was 36. Now, the total number of male students in the entire school district has increased to 348, and the number of female students has increased to 110. The number of students in the Huiqing school district of Yangcheng has also increased to 473. Qin Huaiyi's father, a student at Jincheng No. 3 High School, said, "Now the school can really learn culture!" Parents of students in Beiye, Yicheng, also said, "With the way the school is these days, how can they not study?" However, in many places, there is still a phenomenon of not paying attention to school education. For example, Dongjin Village in Yangcheng mixed winter school with school, and as a result, neither learned well. Teachers have not yet made up their minds to improve. Teachers in Beiye still use corporal punishment instead of education, etc.

　　教学改进学生日增
    太岳教育开始走向正轨
    【太岳电】太岳各地中小学校自实行教育正规化方针后，已取得初步成绩，学生进步很快，入学学生迅速增加。晋豫中学于十月行署教育会议后，即认真举行测验，按程度编班，晋城三高亦经过测验。重新编班，该升级的升级，应降级的降级。招收新生经过严格考试，教育方法逐步改进。不但中学已在有计划的进行教育，小学亦订出了教育计划；如晋城三高过去是碰到什么教什么，讲到哪里是哪里，教员上课前，也不作充分准备；现在已订出每一学期的教育计划和各门功课的进度，教员在上课前均作充分准备，有计划有目的地进行讲解；课余时间，又认真改日记，批阅大小楷。为提高自己，教员也坚持了自己的学习。三高每个教员都订一份报，作为时事学习的材料。另外，每周还有五小时的业务学习。阳城会庆学区，各小学因为订了切合实际的教学计划和具体要求，学生一般学习进步很快。晋豫中学第一次（十月二十五日）总结公布二十一个学生的日记，写错白字的占十分之九，不通的句子有八十三句；第二次（十一月五日）总结公布时，二十四人的日记中，写错白字的已减少到十分之四；不通的句子也减为六十一句。北冶四年级生已能算混合四则题，学生也迅速增多。晋城三高今冬增加新生一百零二名。翼城北冶学区，从前全学区入学男生二百五十四名，女生三十六名，现在全学区共男生增加到三百四十八名，女生增加到一百一十名。阳城会庆学区学生亦增加到四百七十三名。晋城三高学生秦怀义的父亲说：“现在学校真正能学习文化了！”翼城北冶学生家长也说：“象这几天，学校的样儿，还能念不下书？”但有不少地方，还有不重视学校教育的现象，如阳城东进村把冬学与学校搅在一块，结果都没学习好。教员还未下决心改进。北冶教员仍用体罚来代替教育等。
