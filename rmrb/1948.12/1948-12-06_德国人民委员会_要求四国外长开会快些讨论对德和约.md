　　Xinhua News Agency, North Shaanxi, 30th. TASS reports: The Presidium of the German People's Committee issued a statement on November 24, demanding that the governments of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France immediately convene a meeting of foreign ministers to discuss a German peace treaty and prepare for a peace conference. The statement proposes the following preparatory measures: draft the main provisions of the peace treaty based on the Yalta and Potsdam resolutions, establish the administrative and economic unity of Germany, rebuild a unified German currency and remove economic and transportation restrictions between the occupation zones, and establish a temporary democratic central government of Germany composed of representatives of various democratic parties and groups to ensure a lasting peace policy. The statement also suggests convening a peace conference with representatives of the German government participating. When discussing the principles of the peace treaty, the German People's Committee believes that the German people have the following obligations: to pay reparations, but ensuring a general standard of living; to formulate general reparations claims and appropriately calculate the reparations already paid; to finally eliminate the potential for war, especially the armaments industry; to eliminate militarism in German economy and public life; to punish all war criminals and those who have committed crimes against humanity; to recognize that, for a definite period, the four powers have well-founded control over the peaceful development of Germany's economy and politics. The German people must have the following rights: to establish a German constitution that ensures a democratic system of independent national political, economic, and cultural life; to freely develop peaceful industries with their own efforts and with the help of workers, engineers, farmers, craftsmen, and entrepreneurs (excluding monopoly capitalists and landlords); to restore free foreign trade; to withdraw the occupation forces within one year after the conclusion of the peace treaty; to restore normal diplomatic relations and participate in the United Nations.
