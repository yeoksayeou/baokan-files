To the Comrade Editor of the Correspondence Column:

    The addition of the "Study and Discussion" column will greatly assist our future study and theoretical improvement, and I am personally very happy about this.

    I just graduated from North China University. Not long ago, while studying the Cominform and the CCP Central Committee's decision on the South Communist issue, I wrote some outline-style research notes, but I didn't have the opportunity to find someone to give me guidance to correct all the mistakes in my work, which I regret. Today, I am very happy to see the addition of this column in the newspaper. I would like to send it to you, and if there are errors in the content or viewpoint that make it inconvenient to publish, I earnestly request that you point them out to me. Not having the opportunity to have my errors corrected would be a great regret and pain to me....

          Yang Jichuan: Your study notes on the South Communist issue will be reviewed and then we will offer our opinions. Your spirit of conscientious study is very good. We hope you will continue to submit your study notes and questions for everyone to study and discuss. At the same time, we also hope that you can offer your opinions and participate in the discussion on the topic published in the Study and Discussion section on page four of this newspaper on the 8th of this month.

    通讯往来编辑同志：
    你们增设了“学习讨论”一栏，这对于我们今后的学习，理论的提高上，将有莫大的帮助，我个人是非常高兴的。
    我才从华北大学毕业出来，不久以前，我在研读共产党情报局和中共中央对南共问题的决定时，曾写了一些提纲式的研究心得，没有机会去找人给我指正，以改正我这篇东西中所有的错误，感到遗憾。今天从报纸上看到新增设这一栏，非常高兴。愿意寄给你们，倘使因内容观点上有错误，不便发表，我恳切地请求你们给我指出。得不到指正错误的机会，在我是莫大的遗憾和痛苦……。
            杨季川季川同志：你对南共问题的学习心得，待我们研究后再提出意见。你这种认真学习的精神很好，希望能继续将你的学习心得以及问题提出，以便大家研究讨论。同时本月八日本报四版学习讨论中所发表的题目，也望你能提出意见，参加讨论。
