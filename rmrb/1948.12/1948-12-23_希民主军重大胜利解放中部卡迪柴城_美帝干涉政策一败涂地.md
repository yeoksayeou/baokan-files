　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 21st: Reports from various sources state that on the evening of December 11th, approximately 2,000 soldiers of the Greek Democratic Army, after fierce street fighting, liberated the city of Karditsa in the Thessaly region of east-central Greece. The enemy suffered heavy losses in this battle, and detailed results are currently being tallied. One thousand young men and women joined the Democratic Army during the battle to seize Karditsa.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 21st: TASS, Prague, 14th: Dr. Petros Kokkalis, Minister of Social Welfare and Education of the Provisional People's Democratic Government of Free Greece, has arrived in Prague at the invitation of the Czechoslovak "Friends of Democratic Greece" Society. In an interview with a reporter from the Czechoslovak News Agency, Kokkalis described the situation in Greece, stating that U.S. and British imperialists have had to admit that their interventionist policy in Greece has suffered utter defeat. Kokkalis emphasized that everyone has never seen so clearly as now that the Greek people will not yield, and they are determined to achieve final victory. Referring to the situation on the front lines, Kokkalis stated that the Greek People's Liberation Army is now achieving significant victories throughout the country, especially in the southern Peloponnese Peninsula and the Thessaly region of east-central Greece. The battle for Karditsa, the center of the Thessaly Plain, vividly demonstrates the invincibility of the Greek Democratic Army. Kokkalis stated that the Greek people know very well that despite these victories, they still have to fight a major battle before they can drive the foreign interventionists out of their country. Therefore, expressing international solidarity with the Greek people who are fighting for their freedom and independence is of great importance at present.

　　希民主军重大胜利解放中部卡迪柴城
    美帝干涉政策一败涂地
    【新华社陕北二十一日电】各方报导：十二月十一日傍晚，希腊民主军所部二千人之众，经猛烈巷战后，解放希腊中部偏东之色萨利地区的卡迪柴城。敌人在此役中蒙受重大损失，详细战果正清查中。有一千名青年男女在夺取卡迪柴的战斗期间加入民主军。
    【新华社陕北二十一日电】塔斯社布拉格十四日讯：自由希腊临时人民民主政府社会福利和教育部部长皮特罗斯·科卡利斯博士，应捷克斯洛伐克“民主希腊之友”社的邀请已抵达布拉格。科卡利斯在接见捷克斯洛伐克通讯社记者时描述希腊的形势称：美英帝国主义者已不得不承认他们在希腊的干涉主义政策一败涂地。科卡利斯着重指出：每一个人从来没有现在这样清楚地看到：希腊人民是不会屈服的，他们决心要取得最后胜利。科卡利斯提及前线的形势时称：现在，希腊人民解放军在全国各地，尤其是在南部的摩里亚半岛及中部偏东的色萨利地区，皆获得显著的胜利。色萨利平原中心卡迪柴城的争夺战，生动地证明了希腊民主军的所向无敌。科卡利斯称：希腊人民知道得很清楚，虽然有这些胜利，但在他们能够把外国干涉主义者赶出祖国国境以前，他们还要进行大战。因此，对正为其自由、独立而战的希腊人民表示国际团结，在目前就有着巨大的重要性。
