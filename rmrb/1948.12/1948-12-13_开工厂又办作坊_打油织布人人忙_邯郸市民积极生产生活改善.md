　　Opening Factories and Workshops
　　Weaving Cloth and Pressing Oil, All Citizens of Handan Busily Engage in Production to Improve Their Lives
　　【Handan City News】Since the correct implementation of the industrial and commercial policy, industry and commerce in Ximenli and Nanmenli in Handan City have been developing, and the lives of citizens have greatly improved. According to statistics from July to the end of September this year in Ximenli, the total number of households in the street was nominally 209, and the number of industrial and commercial households has increased from 26 to 77. Under the active promotion of village head Yu Jingxiang, the street mobilized the rental of 93 houses and opened five textile factories: Qunhe, Hanguang, Baojin, Yishun, and Yongyi. In addition, there are 15 other facilities such as Chinese medicine cutting shops, cotton ginning houses, and cotton batting factories. Under the active leadership of household registration director Song Qinglian and village head Sun Yougui in Nanmenli, five companies were established, including Jvsheng Vocational Factory, Sanhe Xie Flour Mill, and Hengtai Paper Mill. Under the influence of these companies, five paper mills, Hengchang, Rongchang, Yida, Hongda, and Yeji, also opened one after another. In addition, two steamed bun shops and two wool spinning factories were added. They are also planning to raise shares to open an oil mill. Due to the development of industry and commerce in the two streets, especially the development of the weaving industry, male and female labor forces have been greatly organized to engage in production, which has greatly improved the lives of most citizens in the two streets. In Xijie, as many as 66 households rely on spooling thread or mostly rely on spooling thread for their livelihoods. For example, the Qunhe factory can supply 56 women with thread to spool every day. Each woman can spool at least three catties a day, and the most can spool five catties. In the four months since the Qunhe factory opened, these 56 women have spooled a total of 5,936 catties of thread. Earning 200 yuan per catty, they earned a total of 1,186,000 yuan. In total, 131 women in the five factories in Ximenli participated in spooling thread. After the opening of the wool weaving factory in Nanmenli, more than a dozen women, such as Wang Guodong's wife and Ma Jingchang's wife, can earn 1,200 yuan a day by spinning one catty of wool, and another 400 yuan by spooling two catties of thread. After the Yuxing Iron Factory started operation, it employed six workers every day, giving each person four catties of millet in addition to food. Each paper mill needs people to turn the paper every day, and Yao Qingtings and other 13 people do this work, and they don't have to worry about their livelihoods.
