Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 17th—The people's guerrilla war in Guangdong is developing extensively throughout the province. In the past year, the people's armed forces in the province have, in conjunction with the broad masses of the people, carried out struggles against conscription and grain levies in the range of forty to fifty counties, severely hitting the Kuomintang government's tyrannical policies of conscription and grain requisition. The people's armed forces destroyed more than one hundred granaries in more than forty counties and cities, returning the grain seized from the people by the Kuomintang to the people, forcing many Kuomintang conscription and grain requisition personnel to dare not go to the countryside to press for collections. At that time, the reactionary heads of Guangdong Province, Zhang Fakui and Luo Zhuoying, tried every means possible to eliminate the people's armed forces. They successively sent Deputy Commander of the Security Forces Wei Zhenfu and Chen Pei to personally command and supervise the suppression, and replaced and punished a large number of so-called county magistrates and other personnel who were "ineffective in suppressing bandits," but still achieved no results. Instead, the people's armed forces grew stronger. After Song Ziwenz assumed the post of Chairman of the Kuomintang Guangdong Province at the end of September last year, he actively expanded his military strength, increasing the original ten regiments of security police into sixteen regiments, and also recruited a large number of bandits, forming twelve so-called independent security police battalions. He reinstated reactionary warlords such as Zhang Ruigui and Ye Zhao, and established three "Border Area Suppression Command Headquarters." Recently, he expanded the three supplementary brigades, 131st, 153rd, and 154th, in Guangdong into divisions to participate in the "suppression." When Bandit Song attempted to implement the so-called zoned suppression and key offensives with superior forces, the people's armed forces preemptively launched widespread offensives in June and July this year. The Southern Route once attacked Zhanjiang City (Guangzhou Bay), annihilating an entire battalion of Kuomintang security police; in the battles of Shayu Chong and the ambush at Honghualing in Huiyang on the East River, two battalions of the Kuomintang 154th Division were completely annihilated, and one of its battalions was routed; in the Central District ambush, an entire company of enemy security police was completely annihilated. In several battles, a total of five to six hundred Kuomintang officers and soldiers were killed, wounded, or captured, and various artillery pieces, more than forty light and heavy machine guns, hundreds of long and short guns, and tens of thousands of rounds of ammunition were seized, causing the enemy's suppression plan to fail. Previously, the people's armed forces on the Fujian-Guangdong border had once attacked the county towns of Dapu and Jiaoling, and batches of Kuomintang military and political personnel were captured, and the police self-defense force was disarmed. Now, people's armed forces activities have reached almost every county in Guangdong Province. Outside many county and district towns, the vast countryside is controlled by people's armed forces. This spring, the people's armed forces in the Southern Route joined forces with local troops in southwestern Guangxi, opening up a new situation in dozens of counties. Now, the people's armed forces activities in South China, from the Fujian-Guangdong border in the east to southern and western Guangxi, have been linked together.

　　广东人民武装普遍全省
  　抗击蒋匪抓兵征粮
    闽粤边至桂西南游击队连成一片
    【新华社陕北十七日电】广东人民游击战争正在全省范围内广泛发展中。去年一年，该省人民武装已在四五十县的范围内，结合广大人民，进行了抗丁抗粮的斗争，使国民党政府的征兵征粮暴政遭受了严重打击。人民武装将四十多个县市内一百多处的粮仓打毁，把国民党夺自人民的粮食，发还给人民，迫使国民党许多征兵征粮人员不敢下乡催征。当时广东省的反动头子张发奎和罗卓英曾千方百计地想尽一切办法，妄图消灭人民武装。他们曾先后派出保安副司令韦镇福、陈沛等亲自出马指挥督剿，撤换与处分了大批所谓“剿匪”不力的县长及其他人员，但仍然没有得到任何成效，人民武装反而益发壮大起来。宋匪子文于去年九月底出任国民党广东省主席后，积极扩充兵力，把原有十个团的保警增编为十六个团，又大量收容土匪，编成十二个所谓保警独立营，起用张瑞贵、叶肇等反动军阀，成立三个“边区清剿指挥部”，最近并把在粤的一三一、一五三、一五四等三个补充旅扩编为师，参加“清剿”。当宋匪企图以优势兵力，实施所谓划区清剿，重点进攻之际，人民武装却先发制人，于今年六七月间主动广泛出击，南路一度攻入湛江市（广州湾），全歼国民党保警一个营；东江袭击沙鱼涌和伏击惠阳红花岭两役，全歼国民党军一五四师两个营，并击溃其一个营；中区伏击战，全歼敌保警一个整连。几次战役共毙伤俘国民党官兵五六百人，缴获各式炮数门，轻重机枪四十余挺，长短枪数百支，子弹数万发，使敌人的清剿计划归于破灭。又前此闽粤边人民武装，曾一度攻入大埔、蕉岭两县城，国民党军政人员成批被俘，警察自卫队被缴械。现在广东全省各县几已都有人民武装活动的足迹。不少县份区县城外，均为广大乡村人民武装所控制。今年春间，南路人民武装又与桂西南之当地队伍会合起来，开拓了几十个县的新局面。现在华南东起闽粤边境，西至广西南部及西部的人民武装活动已连成一片。
