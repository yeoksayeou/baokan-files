　　Comrade Wu Yuzhang's Revolutionary Story
    He Qifang
    Preparing for the Huanghuagang Uprising
    In 1910, Comrade Wu Yuzhang secretly went to Beijing to rescue Wang Jingwei and Huang Fusheng, planning matters such as prison break with Zeng Xingzhi's brother, Zeng Jiyou. After more than a month, there was still no progress. He stayed at a relative's house. This relative, seeing his suspicious behavior and knowing that he was a revolutionary, feared something might happen. One day, he bought a train ticket in advance, tricked him onto the train, and sent him all the way to Shanghai. He had no choice but to go to Hong Kong with Xiong Kewu, Dan Maoxin, and But Mu. At this time, Huang Xing, Hu Hanmin, Yu Yungi, Lin Shishuang, and others were in Hong Kong experimenting with bombs and discussing the Guangzhou March 29th Uprising. After Comrade Wu Yuzhang participated in the planning of this famous uprising, he returned to Japan to purchase and transport military supplies.
    Comrade Wu Yuzhang completed this task very well. Every time the military supplies were packed, he personally took care of it. Later, after three or four batches were shipped, he became too busy and asked someone else to pack them for him. This person packed one hundred and twenty pistols in a leather case that was less than three feet long and only a few inches thick. The case looked small, but it was so heavy that it almost made people fall over when lifted. This aroused the suspicion of people at the train station, who deliberately mixed up the traffic signs. Because the sign was wrong, the contents of the box had to be declared and opened for inspection after it was transported to Yokohama before it could be claimed. But this was a box of military supplies, how could it be opened for inspection? Sure enough, the box was detained after it was transported to Yokohama. Comrade Wu Yuzhang was extremely anxious after receiving the telegram from Yokohama. Because the box was marked for shipment to Hong Kong, if the matter was exposed, the previous batches of military supplies still on the sea ships would be confiscated; and if it was publicized in the newspapers, the Guangzhou uprising plan would also be disrupted. He immediately took a train to Yokohama. After thinking of many ways and spending day and night, he finally got the box out. Initially, he bought a box of the same size and color, filled with heavy books, clocks, and the like; then he found a secretary at the consulate to write a letter, wanting to request that the box be taken out and stored in the consulate; if the box could be taken out, he would secretly switch them on the way. However, when the secretary was just starting to write the letter, the consul came out and did not allow it. With no other choice, Comrade Wu Yuzhang risked going to the station himself. At this time, all the other luggage had been claimed, leaving only that one box, guarded by a Japanese person. It was late at night. Comrade Wu Yuzhang negotiated with him directly, saying that the box belonged to a friend, the key had been taken away, and there was no way to open it, asking him to be accommodating. After negotiating with him for a long time, he found that his attitude was not very strict, so Comrade Wu Yuzhang boldly picked up the box while speaking nicely to him, and walked out.
    When he returned to Tokyo, the Miyazaki Torazo family was extremely happy. Miyazaki, also known as Hakuranamitoten, was a famous anarchist in Japan at the time. Chinese revolutionaries bought military supplies through his introduction and secret dealings with Japanese arms dealers. He feared that the exposure of this matter would implicate him, and his family was in a state of panic, putting some of their anarchist secrets in his wife's backpack, carrying it on her back. Therefore, when Comrade Wu Yuzhang returned successfully, his family was amazed and praised him, saying that Comrade Wu Yuzhang was bold, meticulous, courageous, and resourceful.
    The following year, the Nanjing Provisional Government was established, and Mr. Sun Yat-sen became the President. Mrs. Miyazaki came to Nanjing and always said to Mr. Sun Yat-sen: "Don't forget Wu Yongshan." Wu Yongshan was the name Comrade Wu Yuzhang used in Japan at that time.
    Not all Tongmenghui members were as brave and loyal to the revolutionary task as Comrade Wu Yuzhang. Even the first batch of military supplies shipped back to China this time was escorted by a member named Zhou (named Laisu) on an American sea ship. The ship had already departed from Yokohama when Huang Xing sent a telegram from Hong Kong, saying that the ship might be inspected upon arrival and should not dock. Comrade Wu Yuzhang quickly sent someone to take a train to chase and notify this member named Zhou, asking him to be careful, giving him a few hundred yuan to cope with the situation, and telling him not to be afraid. What did this gentleman end up doing? After the ship set sail, he closed the cabin door, opened the window, took out the military supplies from the box, and threw them into the sea one by one. When he arrived in Hong Kong, Huang Xing and other revolutionaries were furious, so he got the nickname: "Zhou Throws into the Sea."
  　Rong County Independence
    After the failure of the Huanghuagang Uprising, Comrade Wu Yuzhang fled to Japan again. Soon, the Sichuan Railway Protection Movement broke out, and the Tongmenghui sent him back to Sichuan to work. In June 1911, he arrived in Yichang and felt that the people were already very uneasy with the status quo, expressing regret for the failure of the Huanghuagang Uprising in their conversations. In July, he arrived in Chongqing and met with Xie Chi and others, learning that the Railway Protection Comrades Association had been established in Chengdu, and citizens were holding Guangxu's memorial tablet to petition Governor-General Zhao Erfeng, asking him to petition the government to revoke the order of nationalizing the railway, but many people were shot dead by his guards. The next day, he returned to his hometown of Rong County from Chongqing. Along the way, he saw Guangxu's memorial tablet being worshipped in various towns, with a couplet written on both sides: "Railways should be allowed to be privately owned, and all government affairs should be subject to public opinion." These were two sentences from the theory of the then deceased Guangxu, used to indicate that railway nationalization violated Guangxu's intentions. The streets were full of yellow cloth, as if the emperor had died, and pedestrians had to dismount or get out of their sedan chairs before they could pass. At first glance, it seemed ridiculous, but this was a form of struggle by the Railway Protection Comrades Association at that time. At that time, there were many constitutionalists in the Railway Protection Comrades Association, including Deng Xiaoke, Zhang Lan, and Luo Lun. The Railway Protection Comrades Association was a grand alliance of revolutionary political factions at that time, including the Tongmenghui, the Constitutional Party, and the Gelaohui. In 1908, Comrade Wu Yuzhang felt that the successive failures of uprisings in various places meant that only with the participation of the broad masses could the revolution succeed. He and Sun Wu of Hubei, Jiao Dafeng of Hunan, Xiong Yueshan of Guangdong, Tang Jie and Zhang Jiuxiang of Sichuan, and his elder brother Wu Kuangshi organized the Gongjinhui together, uniting the Gelaohui, Xiaoyouhui, and Sanhehui of various provinces, following their mountain hall organization, still with them as local leaders, and they jointly elected Wu Kuangshi as the chief and Comrade Wu Yuzhang as the manager. Therefore, the Gelaohui at that time was also under the influence of the Tongmenghui.
    When Comrade Wu Yuzhang arrived at the gate of Rong County, he happened to meet two members of the Tongmenghui, Long Mingjian and Wang Zixiang, leading hundreds of armed militia to rescue Chengdu, because the Railway Protection Comrades Association called on the people of the whole province to rise up and concentrate in Chengdu to fight Zhao Erfeng. Long Mingjian was very happy to see Comrade Wu Yuzhang, he said: "With you back, there will be a solution. They are leading troops to the front line, and we hope you will carefully plan everything for the future." After Long and Wang set off, Guo Shenzhi, a Rong County landlord and pawnshop owner who lent money at high interest, planned to invite several gentry to accuse Long to the county magistrate, falsely claiming that he had robbed public funds. When Comrade Wu Yuzhang found out, he immediately convened a mass meeting, giving him a severe blow, and decided on the spot to encourage rent reduction and donations to help the people's army, and to step up the training of militias in various villages to serve as reserves. Long Mingjian was defeated in battle with the Qing Dynasty patrol army at Qin Huang Temple in Renshou County and died of illness in Jiading. Wang Zixiang led the militia back to Rong County and immediately invited Comrade Wu Yuzhang to discuss raising troops. The Rong County magistrate and Guo Shenzhi fled upon hearing the news, so Rong County declared independence and established a revolutionary government. This was in the middle of the seventh month of the lunar calendar in 1911, a month earlier than the Wuchang Uprising.
    Soon, they attacked the city of Weiyuan County and captured it on the same day. They also attacked Zigong, but encountered stubborn resistance from a large Qing Dynasty patrol army and failed to capture it. At the end of the ninth month of the lunar calendar, the patrol armies from various places concentrated in Zigong, and it was also heard that Duanfang's army was approaching Chengdu, and people became somewhat panicked. However, Comrade Wu Yuzhang calmly persuaded them to hold Rong County, and on the first day of the tenth month of the lunar calendar, he and Wu Shucheng rode lightly to Neijiang, launching another uprising.
  　Neijiang Uprising
    There were many revolutionaries in Neijiang. Moreover, the family of Martyr Yu Yungi, who sacrificed in the Huanghuagang Uprising, could provide cover. On the third day of the tenth month of the lunar calendar, Comrade Wu Yuzhang arrived in Neijiang and happened to meet Duanfang's army passing through, meeting with revolutionaries in the army and deciding that they would kill Duanfang after arriving in Zizhou, and Comrade Wu Yuzhang would launch an uprising in Neijiang. On the fifth, the army revolted in Zizhou as expected, Duanfang was killed, and the Neijiang magistrate fled upon hearing the news. On the morning of the sixth, Yu Yungi's father and local revolutionaries convened a mass meeting in front of the open-air stage of the Tianhou Palace, attended by thousands of people. Comrade Wu Yuzhang announced the revolutionary aims on the stage, advocating the establishment of a revolutionary government. The crowd cheered, and the sound shook the roof tiles. Comrade Wu Yuzhang said that this was the happiest and most honorable thing he had done since he began his revolutionary activities. He felt as if he was reliving the scene of Mazzini of Italy announcing independence on the stage. At that time, the masses unanimously elected Comrade Wu Yuzhang as the Minister of Administration and immediately went to the county office to work.
    Three or four days before this, in the Chengdu New Army, a Tongmenghui member named Xia Zhishi, who was a platoon leader, took advantage of the opportunity to be ordered to set out to suppress the Railway Protection Comrades Association, shooting the company commander Lin Weisheng on the way, leading a company of more than 200 soldiers to revolt and heading straight for Chongqing. After arriving, he received the response of Zhang Peijue, Yang Shukan, Xie Chi, Zhu Shuchi, and others in the city, and occupied Chongqing on October 2, establishing the Shu Military Government, with Zhang Peijue and Xia Zhishi as the chief and deputy governors. On October 8, the military government was also established in Chengdu, with Pu Dianjun and Zhu Qingrun as the chief and deputy governors. Thus, the entire province of Sichuan was restored.

　　吴玉章同志革命故事
    何其芳
    准备黄花岗起义
    一九一○年，吴玉章同志为营救汪精卫、黄复生，秘密到了北京，与曾醒之兄曾季友共同计划劫狱等事。月余，仍无头绪。他寄寓在一亲戚家里。这位亲戚见他行纵可疑，并且知道他是革命党人、害怕出事。有一天，先将车票买好，骗他上车，就一直送他到上海。他只得和熊克武，但懋辛，并勿幕到香港。这时黄兴，胡汉民，喻云纪林时爽等正在香港一面实验炸弹，一面商议广州三月二十九起义。吴玉章同志参加了这次有名的起义的策划后，就回日本去购运军火。
    吴玉章同志对这一任务完成得很好。每次军火装箱，他都去亲手料理。后来运出了三四批以后，因为太忙，就叫另外一个人去替他装。这个人把一百廿支手枪装在一个长不到三尺，厚不过几寸的皮箱里，看起来箱子不大，而提起来却重得几乎要使人跌倒。这样火车站上的人就怀疑了，故意将交通牌子弄错。因为牌子错了，运到动横滨后就要说明箱内东西是什么，并打开来看，如果符合，才能领取。但这是一箱子军火，如何打开看得？果然，运到横滨后这只箱子就被扣住了。吴玉章同志得到横滨来的电报后异常着急。因为箱子上写明了运香港，如果事情暴露，前几批运出的还在海船上的几箱军火都会被没收；而且报纸上一张扬，广州起义计划也将被破坏。他立刻坐火车到横滨去。想了许多方法，花了整天整夜的时间，他终于把那只箱子取出来了。最初、他买了一个和它大小颜色都相同的箱子，里面也装一些沉重的书籍钟表之类；然后去找领事馆的一个秘书写信，想要求把箱子取出即存于领事馆；如果能将箱子取出，则在途中偷偷把它掉换。但是，那个秘书正开始写信时却碰到领事出来了，不让写。实在没有办法了，吴玉章同志就冒险自己跑到车站上去。这时其他行李都领取光了，就还只剩下那一个箱子，一个日本人在看守着。这已是夜深人静的时候。吴玉章同志就和他直接交涉，说箱子是朋友的，钥匙早带走了，实在没有办法打开，要他通融，和他交涉了许久，后来发现他的态度不是很严格，吴玉章同志就一边和他说好话，一边就大胆把那个箱子提起，迳自走出来了。
    当他回到东京时，宫崎寅藏一家人都高兴得了不得。宫崎别号白浪滔天，是日本当时有名的无政府主义者，中国革命党人买军火，都是由他介绍和日本军火商秘密进行的。他怕这事暴露累及于他，一家人都正在惶恐中，把他们无政府主义者的一些秘密东西都放在他太太的背袋里，背在背上。所以吴玉章同志成功归来，他一家人都惊异赞欢，说吴玉章同志胆大心细，有勇有谋。
    第二年，南京临时政府成立，孙中山先生作了大总统，宫崎夫人到南京来，见到孙中山先生就总是要说：“你不要忘记了吴永珊。”吴永珊是吴玉章同志当时在日本用的名字。
    并不是所有的同盟会会员都象吴玉章同志这样勇敢，这样忠实于革命的任务的。就是这次运军火回国的头一批，由一个姓周（名来苏）的会员在一只美国海船上押运。船已经由横滨出发了，黄兴却从香港来了电报，说这只船到时恐怕要被检查不宜搭。吴玉章同志赶快派人坐火车追去通知这位姓周的会员，要他注意，并多给他几百元以资应付，并嘱咐他不要怕。这位先生结果怎样办呢，他就在船开行后把房舱的门关起来，把窗户打开，取出箱子里的军火，一只一只地丢到海里去。他到香港后，黄兴和另外一些革命党人都气坏了，于是他就得到了一个绰号：“周丢海”。
  　荣县独立
    黄花岗起义失败后，吴玉章同志又逃到日本。不久，四川的铁路风潮起来了，同盟会就派他回四川工作。一九一一年六月，他到了宜昌，感到人民已很有不安于现状的情绪，言谈间对黄花岗起义的失败表示惋惜。七月，他到重庆，见着谢持等，知道成都已成立了保路同志会，市民捧光绪牌位向总督赵尔丰请愿，要他代请政府收回铁路国有的成命，竟被他的卫队开枪打死了许多人。他第二天即从重庆回到他的家乡荣县去。沿途见各城镇都供着光绪的牌位，两边写着一付对联：“铁路准其民有，庶政于诸舆论”。这是当时已经死去的光绪的上论中的两句话，用来表示铁路国有是违反了光绪的意思。满街都挂着黄布，仿佛象皇帝死了时一样，行人都要下马下轿才准过去。初看很觉滑稽，但这却是当时保路同志会的一种斗争方式。当时保路同志会有很多立宪党人，有邓孝可、张澜、罗纶等。保路同志会是当时革命政治派别的大联合，其中有同盟会，有立宪党，有哥老会。一九○八年，吴玉章同志因各地起义纷纷失败，就感到要有广大群众参加革命才能成功，就和湖北的孙武，湖南的焦达峰，广东的熊越山，四川的唐洁、张玖祥和他的大哥吴匡时一起组织共进会，把各省的哥老会、孝友会、三合会等联合起来，照他们的山堂组织，仍以他们为各地领袖，而他们又公推吴匡时为坐堂大爷，吴玉章同志为管事。所以当时的哥老会也是在同盟会影响之下的。
    吴玉章同志到荣县城门口时，正碰着同盟会的两个会员龙鸣剑，王子湘率领数百武装民团去救援成都，因为当时保路同志会号召全省人民起来，集中成都与赵尔丰作武装斗争。龙鸣剑见着吴玉章同志非常高兴，他说：“你回来就有办法了。他们带队伍到前线去，一切前途大计望你细心筹划。”龙、王出发后，荣县地主兼高利贷的当铺老板郭慎之就打算约几个豪绅控告龙于县知事，诬称他劫夺公款。吴玉章同志知道了，马上就召集了一个群众会议，给他以严重的打击，当场议决按租劝捐来帮助民军，并加紧训练各乡民团来作后备。龙鸣剑在仁寿县秦皇寺与满清巡防军作战失利，到嘉定病死，王子湘率领民团回荣县，立刻请吴玉章同志商议举事。荣县县知事和郭慎之闻风逃走，于是荣县就宣布独立，成立革命政权。这是一九一一年旧历七月中旬，比武昌起义还早一个月。
    不久进攻威远县城，当天就攻下了。又进攻自流井，却遇满清大队巡防军顽固抵抗，未能攻克。旧历九月底，各地巡防军集中自流井，又听说端方大军快逼近成都，人心就有些惊惶。而吴玉章同志却镇定地说服他们坚守荣县，并于旧历十月一日与吴庶成轻骑到内江，发动又一起义。
  　内江起义
    内江革命党人很多。又有黄花岗起义牺牲了的喻云纪烈士的家庭可以掩护。旧历十月三日，吴玉章同志到内江，正碰到端方军队经过，得与军中革命党人见面，决定他们到资州后杀端方，吴玉章同志即于内江起义。五日，军队果在资州反正，端方被杀，内江知事也闻风逃去。六日晨，喻云纪父亲和当地革命党人召集群众大会于天后宫露天大戏台前，到数千人，吴玉章同志在台上宣布革命宗旨，主张建立革命政权，群众欢呼，声震屋瓦。吴玉章同志说，这是他奔走革命以来最快活最荣幸的一件事，他当时感到恍如意大利马志尼在舞台上宣布独立一幕的重演。当时群众一致举吴玉章同志为行政部长、立刻入县公署办事。
    在这以前三四天，成都新军中有一个同盟会会员夏之时当排长，趁奉令出发讨伐保路同志会的机会，于途中枪击连长林畏生，率一连兵士二百余人起义，直奔重庆。到后得城内张培爵，杨庶堪、谢持、朱叔痴等的响应，于十月二日已占领重庆，成立蜀军政府，张培爵，夏之时为正副都督。十月八日，成都也成立了军政府、浦殿俊、朱庆润为正副都督。于是四川全省遂告光复。
