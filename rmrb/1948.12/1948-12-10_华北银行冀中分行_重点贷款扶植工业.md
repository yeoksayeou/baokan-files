  　Key Loans Support Industry
    [Xinhua News Agency, North China, 8th] The Jizhong Branch of the Hebei Bank of North China has achieved considerable success in selectively providing loans to support small and medium-sized industries such as textiles, oil pressing, and iron and wood products. Well-known industries in Jizhong, such as the Xinji fur industry, the Gaoyang textile industry, the Botou bamboo goods industry, and the Hejian iron and wood industry, have all received loans from the bank, and the bank has also provided overdrafts to help these industries through months of sluggish sales. In the nine months since the beginning of this year, the bank has loaned a total of 2,662,730,000 Jizhong currency to 1,891 households in five industries: textiles, oil pressing, chemicals, papermaking, and iron and wood. In the three cities of Hejian, Anguo, and Dingxian, the bank also issued small production loans of 226,860,000 Jizhong currency, solving the capital shortage problems of 640 legitimate small industrial and commercial businesses. In addition, in order to develop remittance services and facilitate industrial and commercial operators, as of the end of September, 190 cities and towns were fully connected for remittances. In addition to the towns and cities in the Jizhong area, the cities of Handan, Xingtai, Changzhi, Shijiazhuang, and Yangquan are also connected for remittances.
