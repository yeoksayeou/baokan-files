Organizing Supply and Marketing According to Members' Needs
　　Fug 각 Zhuang Cooperative Is Growing Daily
    [Hebei Central News] The Fug 각 Zhuang Cooperative in Wenxin (a newly established county, formed from parts of the original Wen'an and Xinzhen counties) is operating its business according to the needs of its members, organizing multi-faceted production for the members. Since the cooperative was restored with the help of the county and district production work team in September of this year, 64 of the village's 70 households have joined, contributing a total of 17,000 jin of rice. The cooperative also has 38,800 jin of corn from previous reserves. It is actively using these funds.

    Because the village is often flooded, the masses only worry about food and cannot afford clothing and bedding; at the same time, there is a shortage of pots, with the entire village lacking a good pot for each household. For this reason, the director, Liu Jing'an, and others discussed the matter with the members, deciding to solve this problem first. They first milled the rice in the cooperative into polished rice and transported it to Bo Town in seventeen carts to sell, returning with cloth and cotton to supply the members; another three carts were sent to the surrounding villages to buy iron, which was then sent to the county's promotion of the pot factory to exchange for pots. The pots and cloth were then sold to the members at cost.

    Under the unified leadership of the cooperative, about 70 of the 64 member households participated in the cooperative's production, divided into different groups such as oil pressing, carpentry, consumption, transportation and sales, rice milling, reed mat weaving, saltpeter boiling, and fish brining. For example, the reed mat weaving group of four people is responsible for transporting the mats woven by the women of the village to other places to sell, and then exchanging them for reeds to supply the women weaving the mats. The consumption group is run by military dependents and veterans who have no labor force, specializing in supplying the members with daily necessities. The saltpeter boiling group of four people, combined with the rice milling group and the fish brining group, provides the rice bran produced by the rice milling group to the saltpeter boiling group and the fish brining group for fuel. The salt produced by the saltpeter boiling group is then supplied to the fish brining group. The fish brining group of three people brines fish and transports it to the north of the Daqing River to exchange for necessities. In order to accumulate fertilizer, the cooperative also bought eighteen pigs and built three pens, with the pig feed supplied by the fine bran from the rice milling group. In this way, the masses inside and outside the cooperative village were mobilized. In twenty-eight days, a total of more than 19,400 jin of corn were earned. The rice milling group alone earned more than 5,300 jin. Military dependent Zhang Guirong's husband is away from home, and she and her two children weave mats, earning 15 jin of corn every day. The mat weaving households all said: "There is more activity with the cooperative! In the past, we had to go to the market to sell the mats we weaved, and we couldn't exchange them for food, but now we can exchange the mats for food on the same day."

    Because the cooperative actively serves the vast number of members, the members have great trust in the cooperative. Many members have deposited their grain in the cooperative, and the net deposit of grain from the members is now 20,000 jin. Military dependent Zhang Guirong also deposited 1,500 jin of corn earned from weaving mats in the cooperative. She said: "It is more reassuring to deposit it in the cooperative than to store it at home!"

    The masses in the nearby villages, seeing that the cooperative in this village is doing well, have also come to join. Director Liu Jing'an, seeing that people from other villages are also joining, discussed with the members about expanding a credit group to specialize in handling credit business. The households borrowing grain from the cooperative and the grain depositing households all have a certain amount of interest. This proposal has been approved by all members and is being prepared for implementation.

　　按社员需要组织供销
    富各庄合作社日益扩大
    【冀中讯】文新（新设县。原文安、新镇两县各一部划成）富各庄合作社，按社员需要经营业务，组织了社员多面生产。该社从今年九月间由县区生产工作队帮助恢复起来以后，全村七十户，现已有六十四户入了股，共入稻子一万七千斤。社内还有原存的三万八千八百斤玉米。就利用这些资金，积极活动起来。
    因为该村常年被水涝，群众光顾吃烧，顾不了置办穿的和盖的，社员家家缺衣被；同时也缺锅，全村合不上一户一口好锅。为这事，主任刘景安等便和社员们讨论，先解决这个问题。他们首先把社内的稻子碾成大米，由十七辆小车运到泊镇去卖、回来换布、棉，供给社员用；另出三辆小车到四乡去买铁，把铁送到县推进社锅厂里去换锅。锅和布换来以后，都是原价卖给社员。
    在合作社的统一领导下，六十四户社员约有七十人参加社内生产；分为油槽、木作、消费、运销、碾米、席苇、熬硝、卤鱼等各个不同小组。如席苇组四人，专管把本村妇女们织的席运到处边去卖，再换回苇子来，供给织席的妇女用。消费组由没劳动力的军属和荣军经营，专供给社员日用品。熬硝组四人，和碾米组、卤鱼组结合，碾出的米糠供给熬硝组和卤鱼组当柴烧。熬硝组出的盐又供给卤鱼组用。卤鱼组三人，卤出鱼来运到大清河北，换回必需品。合作社为了积肥，又买了十八个猪，修了三个圈，猪的吃食由碾米组的细糠供给。这样一来，全村社内外的群众，都活动了起来。廿八天的工夫，共赚了一万九千四百多斤玉米。其中仅碾米组就赚了五千三百多斤。军属张桂荣的男人不在家，和她两个孩子织席，每天能赚十五斤玉米。织席户都说：“有了合作社活动多了！过去织出席来还得赶集去卖，卖不了换不回粮食来，这会织出席来当天就能换成粮食了。”
    由于合作社为广大社员群众积极服务，所以社员群众对合作社极为信任，许多社员的粮食都存在社内，现净存社员的粮食就有二万斤。军属张桂荣，织席赚的一千五百斤玉米，也存到社内。她说：“存在社里比在家里存着还放心呢！
    附近村的群众，见到这村合作社搞的好，有的也来入股。主任刘景安见到外村也来入股，于是和社员们商量着再扩大一个信用组，专管办理信用业务，各户借的社内的粮食和存粮户，都有一定利息。这个意见已得到全体社员的同意，正在筹备实现。
