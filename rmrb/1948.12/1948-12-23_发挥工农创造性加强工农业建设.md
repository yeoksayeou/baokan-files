Give Play to the Creativity of Workers and Peasants and Strengthen Industrial and Agricultural Construction
        Worker Sun Xibin and others create automatic tool feed
    [Taihang Telegram] In Taihang industrial production, there are two more recent creations that have contributed greatly to increasing production.
    In the public-owned Yihua Textile Factory, foreman Sun Xibin and machinists Jiang Shijie and steel wire machine craftsman Li Kezhong, when installing machines, created an automatic tool feed by modifying old machine parts, greatly increasing the speed of machine installation. Six months of work were completed in two months, and the factory's only special grinding wheel was saved. In order to reward the invention, the company, in addition to issuing a notice to all its factories and mines to learn from and commend these three comrades, also awarded Sun Xibin 100 jin of millet, Jiang Shijie 80 jin of millet, and Li Kezhong 50 jin of millet, as well as three commendation orders. The process of creation is as follows:
    Due to careless handling during the transportation of the machines, the large drum of the sizing machine was uneven and completely rusted. If these rusts are not removed, the unevenness will affect the quality of the cotton combing. Repairing these problems requires a special grinding wheel; however, it would take six months to repair them all, and the factory only had one special grinding wheel, which was only enough to repair part of the machine. At this time, Sun Xibin, Jiang Shijie and other comrades, in order to overcome the current difficulties and complete the task ahead of schedule, researched a new machine repair tool to replace the grinding wheel. This tool uses a lathe tool from a four-foot gantry gold to repair the large drum manually. In this way, four workers can repair one, but the turning is uneven and very laborious. After further research, it was changed to an automatic tool feed; and a vertical rod was added next to the tool feed, which was a further step forward and improved work efficiency.

    　　　　Yin Huafeng creates a hydraulic engine
    Yin Huafeng in Xingtai City successfully created a hydraulic engine. The engine is simple to manufacture and very effective. Two engines with 15 horsepower and 20 horsepower have now been produced. After testing by the Huafeng Water Mill in the city, both were very successful. A 15-horsepower hydraulic engine can grind 1,000 jin of wheat per day. A 20-horsepower engine can grind 1,700 jin of wheat, which is three times the power of the old-fashioned water mill (the old-fashioned water mill can grind up to 400 jin of wheat per day). In addition to making flour, this power machine can also drive rice mills, cotton gins, and cotton gins. The government is now assisting in mass production.

    　　　　Farmer Su Erchun successfully makes tile pots
    [Beiyue News] Su Erchun, a farmer from Su Fengtong Village, Fifth District, Lingshou, planned to learn how to make tile pots last winter. After making a plan, he was opposed by his father and ridiculed by his neighbors, who said he was messing around. However, he was not discouraged and overcame all difficulties to continue his research. He used his spare time to build two wheels for making pots. On the fifth day of the first lunar month, he began to make them, and all the expenses were borrowed by himself. In February, just after a kiln was built, it was washed away by rain. The family's opposition and the villagers' sarcasm became even more severe, thinking that it would not succeed, but he still determined to rebuild it. On July 18th, he loaded the kiln, and on September 18th, he took out the kiln. Although he lacked experience in the initial experiment, and fifty sets were damaged during the transportation and loading of the kiln, he finally succeeded in the experiment. From the beginning to the first kiln being fired, it cost a total of 14 dou of millet and 2,600 jin of firewood. After deducting the total consumption, this kiln of pots earned 5,000 yuan (new currency) in addition to the damaged ones. If the labor cost is included, it does not earn any money. But he has a pot kiln and learned the technology, laying the foundation for the future. In the past, it took two months to make a kiln, but now it only takes half a month to make a kiln. The second kiln is about to be completed, and it is estimated that it can earn more than 16,000 yuan (new currency). Now the family's opposition has turned into preferential treatment, and the neighbors' ridicule has turned into praise. (Guo Zhu, Yi Yuan)

　　发挥工农创造性　加强工农业建设
        工人孙希斌等创造自动走刀
    【太行电】太行工业生产上，近又有两项创造，对提高生产量颇有贡献。
    公营益华纺织厂机工领工孙希斌和机工蒋士杰、钢丝机匠李克忠三人，在安装机器时，创造出以旧机器零件改装为自动走刀，使安装机器的速度大大提高。六个月的工作，在两个月内完成，并节省了该厂仅有的一个特种砂轮。公司方面，为奖励创造发明，除通令所属各厂矿向这三位同志学习并予以表扬外，又分别奖给孙希斌小米一百斤、蒋士杰小米八十斤、李克忠小米五十斤，及表扬令三张。创造的过程是这样：
    该厂由于在搬运机器时不慎，将锱丝机大滚筒碰得高低不平，并全部生了锈。这些锈如不磨去，高低不平，如不修好，将影响梳棉质。修好这些毛病，需要特种砂轮才行；但全部修好需六个月，且该厂只有特种砂轮一个，只够修理一部分机器用。这时孙希斌、蒋士杰等同志，为克服目前困难，提前完成任务，即研究出一种新的修理机器工具，以代替砂轮。这种工具，是以人工搬出四尺龙门金上的旋床刀来修理大滚筒。这样四个工可修好一个，但旋的粗细不匀，也很费力，又经进一步研究，改成了自动走刀；并在走刀旁加了一根立杆，较前进了一步，提高了工作效率。
    　　　　尹华丰创造水力发动机
    邢台市尹华丰，创造水力发动机成功。该发动机制造简便，效力很大，现已制出机当于十五匹马力及二十匹马力的发动机两部。经该市华丰水磨等试验，均很成功。十五匹马力水力机，每日可磨麦子一千斤。二十匹的可磨麦子一千七百斤，比旧式水磨动力增加三倍（旧式水磨最多每天可磨麦子四百多斤）。此动力机除能制粉外，也可推动碾米、弹花、轧花等机器。现政府正协助大量制造。
    　　　　农民苏二春捏瓦盆成功
    【北岳讯】灵寿五区苏凤同村农民苏二春，去年冬天他打算学捏瓦盆，作出计划后，遭到他父亲的反对和街坊的讥笑，说他是瞎胡闹。他却毫不灰心，克服一切困难，继续钻研，利用闲暇时间，将两个捏盆用的轮子造起。正月初五日，开始捏起来，一切费用完全是由自己东拉西借，二月间刚造好一座窑即被雨冲塌，家庭的反对及乡亲们的讽刺更厉害了，认为成不了事，可是他还是坚定意志，重新再造，七月十八日装窑，九月十八日出窑，虽因初步试验没有经验，在搬运装窑时损坏五十套，但终于试验成功。自开始至第一窑烧出，共费小米十四斗，烧柴二千六百斤。这窑所烧盆子除损坏外，除去总消费还赚五千元（新币），若连人工计算在内，不赚什么钱。但却有了盆窑，也学会了技术，打下了以后的基础。过去两个月才捏起一窑，现在仅半个月即能捏起一窑，刻下即将完成第二窑，计算能赚洋一万六千余元（新币）。现在家庭的反对变成优待，街坊的讽刺变成了赞扬。（国柱、一元）
