　　The Entire Workforce of This Newspaper's Factory
  　Donates Money and Labor to Support the Front Lines
    [This Newspaper News] Upon hearing the news that our army had launched a powerful offensive on the Ping-Zhang front, encircling Zhangjiakou and Beiping, the workers of this newspaper's printing factory were greatly encouraged in their production enthusiasm. While working, everyone was saying, "Fu Zuoyi is finished, we must work harder to support the front lines and win more and bigger victories." Some comrades said, "With more victories in the future, our work will be even more arduous, so we must work even harder!" Before the words were finished, another comrade said happily, "Working day and night is fine too." After dinner in the afternoon, encouraged by the victory, the factory held a general meeting of all employees, calling for donations of money and goods to support the front lines, and to respond to the Labor University's call to do one day of voluntary work to support the worker movement in the Chiang-occupied areas. As soon as the chairman finished speaking, Comrade Zhu Qifa was the first to donate 20,000 Jiao of Hebei currency and three days of voluntary work. Immediately, shouts of "10,000" and "15,000" rang out in the hall. Trainee Cui Quansheng originally had very little left each month after food expenses, but he was unwilling to lag behind and rushed to donate 5,000 yuan, doing one day of voluntary work. Zhang Jinchun, a 13-year-old family member of a worker, also donated 5,000 Jiao of Hebei currency, her usual savings. In less than ten minutes, a total of 327,000 Jiao of Hebei currency and fifty-three days of voluntary labor were donated. Finally, Factory Director Chen gave an excited speech, calling on everyone to not only work harder, but also to guarantee attending classes on time as in the past to improve their education. In this short period of time, they should intensify their study of the tasks of the labor movement and urban policies, so that after entering the city, they can better unite the urban workers and jointly develop production.

　　本报工厂全体职工
  　献金献工支援前线
    【本报讯】本报印刷厂工人接到我军对平张全线发动强大攻势，包围张家口与北平的消息后，大大鼓舞了生产情绪。大家一面工作，一面说着：“傅作义快完蛋了，我们一定加倍的努力工作，支援前线，打更多更大的胜仗。”有的同志说：“今后胜利多了，我们的工作就要更加繁重，咱们要加倍的努力才行啊！”话犹未完，另一个同志高兴地说：“白天黑夜干也行。”下午晚饭后，在胜利的鼓舞下，工厂召开全体职工大会，号召献金献物，支援前线，和响应劳大号召，作义务工一天，支援蒋占区职工运动。主席刚刚讲完，朱启发同志头一个捐出冀钞二万元，义务工三天。会场上立即接着响起“一万”、“一万五”的喊叫声。练习生崔全生本来一月除吃以外所剩无几，但他不肯落后，争着献了五千元，作义务工一天。十三岁的工人家属女孩张晋春，把她平时节余的零花钱冀钞五千元也献出来了。不到十分钟，共献出冀钞三十二万七千元，五十三个义务工。最后陈厂长很兴奋的讲话，号召大家除更加努力工作外，还应和过去一样的保证按时上课，提高文化。应在这短短的时间里，加紧学习职工运动的任务及城市政策，以便进城后很好地团结城市工人，共同发展生产。（耀堂）
