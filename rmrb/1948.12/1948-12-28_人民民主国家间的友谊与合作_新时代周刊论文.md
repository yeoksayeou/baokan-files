Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th - TASS News: The Soviet Union's "New Era Weekly" recently published an article entitled "Friendship and Cooperation Between People's Democratic Countries." It states:

　　Since the end of World War II, the lives of the countries of Central and Southeast Europe have undergone fundamental changes. The chains of imperialism have been broken here. The people of the countries liberated by the Soviet army will no longer be treated as pawns of foreign reactionary forces. After shaking off the shackles of imperialism, the people's democratic countries began to advance along the road of socialism, and today they are reaping the initial fruits of their progress along this road.

　　First of all, the roots of territorial conflicts between these countries have been eliminated. As a result of the far-reaching social and economic reforms implemented by the government of the Romanian Republic, a solid foundation has been laid for the friendship between Romanians and Hungarians in Outer Transylvania and Banat. The working people of Romanians and Hungarians in these provinces have obtained land on an equal basis, and the state provides them all with the same assistance. The problem of Outer Transylvania has been resolved according to democratic principles, which has helped fundamentally change the relations between Romania and Hungary. Similar fundamental changes have taken place in the relations between Romania and Bulgaria, which have successfully and peacefully resolved the issue of Southern Dobruja. The same changes have taken place in the relations between other countries in Central and Southeast Europe, which were previously torn apart by various disputes and conflicting demands. The strengthening of friendly relations between the people's democratic countries has had a huge effect on their economies and their economic ties with each other.

　　The Soviet Union gives fraternal help to the people's democratic countries. Without the Soviet Union's decisive help in providing food and supplies, these countries would not have been able to overcome the disasters caused by the poor harvests of 1945 to 1947. The Soviet Union's regular supply of raw materials, fuels, and semi-finished products, as well as its organizational and technical assistance, have promoted the recovery and development of the economies of the people's democratic countries. At the same time, the mutually beneficial commercial and loan agreements concluded by these countries with the Soviet Union have guaranteed a market for a certain portion of the products of the people's democratic countries. According to the Czechoslovak News Agency: Czechoslovakia's exports in October of this year amounted to 3.403 billion Czech crowns, while in 1947 they were 2.668 billion Czech crowns. The trade plan between the Czech Republic and the Soviet Union for 1949 will exceed 360 million US dollars. According to preliminary estimates, Soviet-Polish trade will reach approximately 250 million US dollars this year.

　　Economic ties and mutual assistance between the people's democratic countries have also been constantly strengthening. The example of Czechoslovakia can illustrate this. In the first ten months of 1948, Czechoslovakia's exports to the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries accounted for 34 percent of its total exports, while imports from these countries accounted for 38 percent of its total imports. However, in the first ten months of last year, these two figures were 18 percent and 16 percent, respectively. Trade between the Czech Republic and Hungary is also expected to increase. The two countries signed a five-year trade agreement on November 20. According to this agreement, the total trade volume between the two countries will be at least 15 billion Czech crowns. Hungary will deliver grain, certain raw materials, and electrical equipment. The Czech side will supply coking coal, timber, iron seedlings, and various machines. Czechoslovakia, which has a heavy machinery manufacturing industry, has received orders for various types of equipment needed by the Balkan countries until 1952. The total value of these orders is 400 million US dollars. These are the ways in which the foreign trade of the Czechoslovak Republic is developing. In the foreign trade of Poland, Romania, Hungary, and Bulgaria, the proportion of trade with the people's democratic countries is even higher.

　　However, the development of trade is not the only form of economic cooperation and mutual assistance between the countries of Eastern Europe. This cooperation and mutual assistance also takes other forms. For example, a standing special committee for economic cooperation has been established to help complete the economic agreement between the Czech Republic and Poland. This committee has formulated detailed plans to gradually coordinate the industrial plans of the Czech Republic and Poland. The purpose is to make full use of the raw material resources, experience, and industrial productivity of the two countries. For example, it has been suggested that twenty industrial factories be built jointly. In addition, mutual assistance is being provided in the development of transportation facilities. These forms of cooperation between the two countries mark a new high level of labor division between them. This is unimaginable in the atmosphere of fierce capitalist competition, dumping, and discrimination.

　　The economic progress of the people's democratic countries has increased their share in world trade. In the third year after the war, the import and export trade of the countries of Eastern Europe reached more than 3 billion US dollars (including 1 billion US dollars for the Czech Republic and 1 billion US dollars for Poland). This year, Poland's coal exports can reach 25 million tons: it has become the largest coal exporter in Europe. According to the recent temporary agreement signed in Paris, Poland will supply the Netherlands with approximately 800,000 tons of coal next year. Needless to say, American and British monopoly capitalists are trying everything possible to hinder the export of Polish coal to Western Europe, because if Western European countries can freely purchase first-class Polish coal, they will not have to spend millions of dollars more to purchase American coal, which is of inferior quality, expensive, and has to be transported across the ocean. The smooth development of oil production in Romania's state-owned oil fields has enabled Romania to greatly increase its oil exports. As a result of the good harvest in 1948, Romania and Hungary will be able to export large quantities of grain. Like Poland, Romania and Hungary are planning to increase their exports of livestock and other agricultural products.

　　However, the role of the people's democratic countries is not limited to the export of food supplies, raw materials, and fuels. They are also helping the industrialization of economically backward countries. The Czech Republic, Poland, and Hungary are exporting industrial products to the most remote parts of the world and have trade agreements with dozens of countries on all continents. For example, Czechoslovakia has agreed to meet the request of the Pakistani government to help the country's industrial development. The Pakistani government has proposed supplying machines and providing technical assistance for the construction of industrial factories. Technicians from Pakistan will be trained under the guidance of Czech experts. Unlike the United States and Britain, Czechoslovakia does not make any onerous and exploitative demands when undertaking the major obligation of equipping Pakistani industry. The Czech-Pakistan agreement is based on the principles of equality and mutual benefit. In this fact, we can also see a vivid manifestation of the fundamentally different policies of the two camps—the imperialist camp and the democratic camp. The imperialists oppose the economic development of small and weak countries and dependencies. The democratic forces are fighting for the equality of all nations, for their independent development, and for friendship and mutual understanding between them.

### 人民民主国家间的友谊与合作　新时代周刊论文

　　人民民主国家间的友谊与合作
  　新时代周刊论文
    【新华社陕北二十六日电】塔斯社讯：苏联新时代周刊顷发表“人民民主国家间的友谊与合作”一文。内称：
    第二次世界大战结束以来，中欧与东南欧各国的生活，已发生根本的变化。帝国主义的锁链，在这里已被打破。被苏军解放的各国人民，已从此不再当作外国反动势力的赌注。人民民主国家摆脱了帝国主义的枷锁以后，就开始沿着社会主义的道路前进，而今天，他们正在收获他们沿着这条道路所获得的初步果实。
    首先，产生这些国家之间领土冲突的根由，已被清除掉。由于罗马尼亚共和国人民政府所实行的社会与经济方面的远大的改革，其结果，已为外西里瓦尼亚与巴纳特的罗马尼亚人与匈牙利人之间的友谊建立了坚固的基础。这些省份中的罗马尼亚人与匈牙利人的劳动人民，在平等的基础上获得土地，国家对他们所有的人给与同样的帮助。外西里瓦尼亚的问题，已根据民主的原则获得解决，这帮助了罗马尼亚与匈牙利之间关系的根本改变。罗马尼亚与保加利亚间的关系，也有相同的根本改变，他们已胜利地和睦地解决了南多布鲁查的问题。中欧与东南欧其他以前曾经因为各种纠纷和互相对立的要求而弄得四分五裂的各国，它们之间的关系也发生了同样的改变。各人民民主国家间友好关系的加强，已在它们的经济及它们相互间的经济联系上产生了巨大效果。
    苏联给与人民民主国家以兄弟的帮助。假如没有苏联供给粮食和供应品来进行决定性帮助的话，这些国家便不能克服一九四五年至一九四七年因歉收所造成的灾难。苏联定时的供应原料、燃料、半制成品，苏联在组织上技术上的援助，促进了人民民主国家经济的恢复与发展。同时，这些国家与苏联缔结的互惠的商务及贷款协定，为人民民主国家产品的一定部分保证了市场。据捷克斯洛伐克通讯社消息：捷克今年十月份的出口额，计达三十四亿零三百万捷币，而一九四七年则为二十六亿六千八百万捷币。捷苏间一九四九年的贸易计划，将超过三亿六千万美元。据初步估计，苏波贸易今年将达约二亿五千万美元。
    人民民主国家间的经济联系与互助，同样一直是经常地增强着。捷克斯洛伐克的例子可以给这方面一个说明。在一九四八年头十个月中，捷克斯洛伐克对苏联及各人民民主国家的出口额，计达其出口总额的百分之三十四，而从这些国家来的入口额，占其入口总额的百分之三十八。但在去年头十个月中，这两个数字分别为百分之十八与十六。捷匈两国间的贸易，预计也将有增加。该两国在十一月二十日缔订了为期五年的贸易协定。按照这个协定，两国间贸易总额最少将达一百五十亿捷币。匈牙利将运交粮食、若干种原料及电气器材。捷方则将供应焦煤、木材、铁苗及各种机器。拥有重机械制造工业的捷克斯洛伐克，已收到巴尔干国家所需各式装备直到一九五二年的定货。这些定货的总值达四亿美元。这些便是捷克斯洛伐克共和国对外贸易据以发展的途径。在波、罗、匈、保对外贸易中，它们与人民民主国家的贸易比例数更要高。
    然而，贸易的发展并不是东欧各国间经济合作与互助的唯一形式。这种合作与互助还有其他的形式。例如，经济合作常设特别委员会已经设立，用以帮助完成捷波两国间的经济协定。这个委员会已制订详细的计划，以便捷波两国的工业计划逐渐协调。其目的，是要充分利用两国的原料资源、经验与工业生产力。例如，曾经建议共同建立二十座工业工厂。此外，正在提供在发展运输设施上的互助。两国之间合作的这些形式，标志着它们之间劳动分工水平的新高涨。这在资本主义激烈竞争、倾销与歧视的气氛中，是不可想象的。
    人民民主国家的经济进展，使它们在世界贸易中增加了比重。在战后的第三年，东欧各国进出口贸易便已达到三十余亿美元（包括捷克十亿美元，波兰十亿美元）。今年，波兰输出的煤可达二千五百万吨：它已成为欧洲最大的煤的出口国。按照最近在巴黎缔订的临时协定，波兰明年将供给荷兰约八十万吨煤。不消说，美英垄断资本家正想尽一切方法阻碍波兰的煤向西欧的输出，因为如果西欧各国可以自由购买波兰头等煤的话，它们便可以无须多花千百万美元购买那质劣价昂且须远涉重洋运输的美国煤了。罗马尼亚国有油田之石油生产的顺利发展，已使罗马尼亚能够大大增加它的石油出口。由于一九四八年丰收的结果，罗匈两国将能大量输出谷物。罗匈两国象波兰一样，正计划增加它们的家畜以及其他农作物的出口。
    但是，人民民主国家的作用并不限于粮食供应品、原料与燃料的输出。它们也在帮助经济落后国家的工业化。捷、波、匈三国正将工业品输出到世界上最偏僻的部分，与各大洲数十个国家都有贸易协定。譬如，捷克斯洛伐克已同意满足巴基斯坦政府关于帮助该国工业发展的请求。巴基斯坦政府曾建议供给机器，并对建设工业工厂提供技术援助。巴基斯坦的技师，将在捷专家的指导下受训。捷克斯洛伐克与美英不同，它在承担装备巴基斯坦工业的重大义务时，并不提出任何重利盘剥的勒索条件，捷巴（基斯坦）协定是基于平等与互惠原则的。我们在这件事实上，也可以看到两个阵营——帝国主义阵营与民主阵营——政策上截然不同的生动表现。帝国主义者反对弱小国家与附属国的经济发展。民主力量则正为各民族平等、为它们的独立发展、为它们之间的友谊与互相谅解而奋斗。
