　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 18th: TASS reports: The Soviet "Labor Daily" recently published a special article by Karasin on the unification congress of the two Polish workers' parties, stating that this congress is not only an event of great significance in Polish political life, but also that the unification of the two Polish workers' parties signifies a further consolidation of the international front for the struggle for peace, democracy, and socialism. The working class plays an outstanding role in the victorious progress and remarkable achievements of the people's democratic countries. In the Eastern European countries liberated by the Soviet army from the shackles of Hitler, the working class is the main driving force for implementing far-reaching social and economic reforms. The working class leads the working people to fight for the consolidation of the people's democratic system and for the most rapid economic upsurge. The working class recognizes this historical task, and therefore, unites its ranks more closely. This process is vividly manifested in the merger of the Communist and Socialist parties of Hungary, Romania, Czechoslovakia, and Bulgaria. The working class of the new Poland is also completing its political unity. The establishment of a unified party ends the division in the ranks of the Polish working class that has lasted for more than half a century. The unification of the two parties means that the great ideas of Marxism-Leninism have achieved a decisive victory over reformism and nationalism in the Polish workers' movement.

　　波两工人政党合并
  　象征着民主阵营益趋巩固
  　劳动报专文致贺
    【新华社陕北十八日电】塔斯社讯：苏联劳动报顷发表卡拉辛论波兰两工人政党统一大会的专文称，这次大会不仅是在波兰政治生活中具有伟大意义的事件，而且波兰两工人政党的统一，意味着为和平、民主与社会主义斗争的国际阵线的力量之进一步巩固。在人民民主国家的胜利进展和战后的卓越成就中，工人阶级起着杰出的作用。在被苏军从希特勒枷锁下解放的东欧各国，工人阶级是实行深远的社会和经济改革的主要动力。工人阶级领导劳动人民为巩固人民民主制度、为最迅速的经济高涨而斗争。工人阶级认识到这一历史任务，因此，将它的队伍团结得更加紧密。这一过程生动地表现在匈、罗、捷、保的共产党和社会党的合并中。新波兰的工人阶级，也在完成其政治团结。统一的党的建立，终结了半世纪多以来波兰工人阶级队伍中的分裂。两党统一意味着在波兰工人阶级运动中，马列主义的伟大思想已对改良主义和民族主义取得了决定性的胜利。
