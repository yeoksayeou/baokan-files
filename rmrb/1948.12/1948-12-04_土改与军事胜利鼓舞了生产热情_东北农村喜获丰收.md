　　Land Reform and Military Victory Inspired Production Enthusiasm
  　Northeast China's Rural Areas Achieve Bumper Harvest
    [Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 30th] With the liberation of Northeast China, the rural areas of the liberated zone victoriously completed their first bountiful autumn harvest after land reform. This year's autumn harvest was greatly encouraged by the great military victories on the front lines. The peasants were extremely enthusiastic and generally achieved timely harvesting, avoiding losses from windstorms, frost, and grain damage due to delayed harvesting. According to preliminary statistics from the Agricultural Department of the Northeast Administrative Committee, the total cultivated land area in the region, excluding the newly recovered areas after October, was more than 13,415,900 hectares (each hectare is 10,000 square meters). Among them, the newly reclaimed land area was more than 779,830 hectares, and the paddy field area accounted for more than 214,650 hectares (an increase of 90,000 hectares this year). The disaster-stricken area was about one million hectares, of which about one-third had no harvest. According to annual estimates, the average yield of various crops in various places was 1,900 jin per hectare. Liaoning Province had the highest average yield of 2,200 jin per hectare, and Liaobei Province had the lowest average yield of more than 1,700 jin per hectare. The average yield of paddy fields was 4,000 jin per hectare, and the average yield of wheat was 400 jin per hectare. Except for wheat, which suffered from disaster and had a poor harvest, the yields of other crops have increased compared with the past. The total output of Northeast China this year, excluding the disaster-stricken areas, was 11,870,667 tons, completing the planned production target and increasing production by 12 percent compared with last year. The achievement of this great success is due to the correct leadership of the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, the arduous efforts of rural cadres in various places, and especially the unprecedented increase in the production enthusiasm of the broad masses of peasants after the land reform. When the large-scale production movement began this year, party committees and governments at all levels took it very seriously, seized the opportunity, and promptly solved various problems in production. After the Northeast Bureau issued a production instruction in February, various localities immediately organized spring plowing with all their strength, and promptly transformed the cadres and work teams engaged in land reform into spring plowing work teams. Cadres from various provinces and counties went to the countryside to strengthen production leadership on the spot, determine land rights, and return and compensate the land and property of middle peasants that had been wrongly struggled against. The production policy of publicizing production to get rich, rewarding labor to increase production, and a fair and reasonable burden policy, as well as the principle of voluntary and mutually beneficial production cooperation, made people of all strata turn their attention to the goal of production to get rich. Governments at all levels helped farmers solve many difficulties in production in a timely manner during the production campaign. The Northeast Political Committee successively issued various loans of 15.1 billion yuan, purchased more than 36,500 head of draft animals on behalf of farmers, helped various places adjust 17,380,000 jin of seeds, and more than 20,020,000 jin of horse feed. At the same time, it organized livestock epidemic prevention teams to go to the countryside to help farmers prevent livestock deaths. The Ministry of Agriculture has successively issued more than 509,000 CC of cattle and horse plague serum. Due to last year's poor harvest and the devastation of the Kuomintang bandit army, coupled with the continuous natural disasters since the beginning of spring, about 1.5 million disaster-stricken people were able to successfully overcome the disaster under the local government's implementation of work-for-relief, grain lending, rush planting, replanting, and organizing sideline production. The Political Committee has successively issued more than 60,000 tons of relief grain, adjusted 18,910,049 jin of various seeds, and replanted 245,409 hectares of disaster-stricken land. The cultivated land benefiting from water conservancy construction and dike building in various places also amounted to more than 440,300 hectares. All of this has further promoted the production confidence and enthusiasm of the peasants, and thus the labor efficiency has been further improved. In addition to planting all the original land, they also newly reclaimed land exceeding the original plan by more than 20 percent. In farming, due to the preliminary change in the previous habit of not farming carefully and meticulously, they generally did more manuring and fertilization, and generally did two hoeings and two passes, and some did three hoeings and three passes. This year's crops were full and strong, surpassing previous years. The labor force participating in production in rural areas has also been generally expanded. A total of 6,010,260 laborers and 2,965,960 livestock in eight provinces and one special municipality in the region (excluding Inner Mongolia, Changchun and Shenyang) participated in cultivation, exceeding the figure before "August 15". Not only are poor peasants, hired peasants, and middle peasants actively producing, but also the old landlords who have not worked for a long time are mostly engaged in farming under the new labor discipline. The hooligans have also been largely reformed, thereby changing the entire rural landscape. All of these have ensured the successful completion of this year's production plan and laid a solid foundation for a larger-scale production movement next year.

　　土改与军事胜利鼓舞了生产热情
  　东北农村喜获丰收
    【新华社哈尔滨三十日电】东北解放区农村与全东北解放同时，胜利完成了土地改革后第一个丰盈的秋收。今年秋收在前线伟大军事胜利鼓舞下，农民的热情极高，普遍做到了及时收割，避免了风灾霜雪及因迟收而＠蹋粮食的损失。据东北行政委员会农业部初步统计，全区今年耕地面积除十月以后之新收复区外，共为一千三百四十一万五千九百余垧（每垧一万平方公尺），其中新开荒地面积为七十七万九千八百三十余垧，水田面积占廿一万四千六百五十余垧（今年增加九万垧）。受灾面积约百万垧，其中约三分之一无收获。各地各种作物如按年景估计，其平均产量为每垧一千九百斤。辽宁省最高平均每垧产量为两千二百斤，辽北省最低平均每垧产量为一千七百余斤。稻田平均每垧四千斤，麦子平均每垧四百斤。除麦子因受灾歉收外，其他作物的产量均比过去增加。全东北除受灾面积外，今年总产量为一千一百八十七万零六百六十七吨，完成了预定的生产计划，并较去年增产百分之十二。这一个巨大成绩的获得，是由于中共中央东北局正确的领导，各地农村干部的艰苦努力，尤其是土改后广大农民生产热情空前提高的结果。当今年大生产运动开始时，各地党委及政府均十分认真，抓紧了时机，及时解决了生产中的各项问题。东北局于二月发出生产指示后，各地随即以全力组织春耕，将从事土地改革的干部与工作团及时转变为春耕工作团，各省县干部纷纷下乡，就地加强生产领导，确定地权，划回与补偿斗错的中农土地财物。宣传生产致富、奖励劳动增产的生产政策与公平合理的负担政策、以及自愿两利的生产互助原则，使各阶层人民把自己的注意力转向生产致富的目标上。各地政府在生产运动中适时地帮助农民解决了生产中的不少困难。东北政委会曾先后发放各种贷款一百五十一亿元，为农民代购耕畜三万六千五百余头，帮助各地调剂一千七百三十八万斤种子，及两千零二十余万斤马料，同时并组织家畜防疫组下乡，帮助农民防止牲畜的死亡。农业部先后共发出牛、马疫瘟等血清五十万九千余ＣＣ。某些地区由于去年歉收及国民党匪军的蹂躏，加之入春以来连续发生的自然灾害，约有一百五十万受灾人民在当地政府执行以工代赈、贷粮抢种补种与组织副业生产等办法下，胜利渡过了灾荒。政委会先后发救济粮六万余吨，调剂各种种籽一千八百九十一万零四十九斤，补种受灾地二十四万五千四百零九垧。各地因兴修水利筑堤防汛而受益的耕地，亦有四十四万零三百余垧。凡此一切，更加促进了农民的生产信心及积极性，因而劳动效率更为提高。他们除将原有的土地全部种上外，并新开荒地超过了原订计划百分之二十以上。在耕作中，由于初步改变了以前不精耕细作的习惯，一般的做到了多上粪多施肥及普遍的两铲两趟，有的做到了三铲三趟。今年的庄稼饱满茁壮，胜过了往年。农村中参加生产的劳动力亦普遍扩大，全区八个省一个特别市（内蒙及长春沈阳除外）共有六百零一万零二百六十余个劳动力及二百九十六万五千九百六十余头牲口参加耕种，超过了“八一五”前的数字。各地不仅是贫农雇农中农积极生产，即长期不劳而食的旧地主，在新的劳动纪律下，亦绝大多数从事耕作，二流子也大批得到了改造，从而改变了整个农村的面貌。所有这些，保证了今年生产计划的胜利完成，并打下了明年更大规模的生产运动的巩固基础。
