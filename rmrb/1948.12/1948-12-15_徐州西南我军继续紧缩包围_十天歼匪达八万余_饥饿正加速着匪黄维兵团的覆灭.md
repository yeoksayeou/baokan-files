Xinhua News Agency, Huaihai Front, December 12th: The three Kuomintang army corps encircled northeast of Yongcheng have been eliminated by approximately 80,000 men from December 2nd to December 12th. Among the 80,000+ enemies eliminated, included the entirety of Sun Yuanliang's 16th Army Corps, including two armies. When Sun's corps attempted to break out on the 7th, the majority were annihilated. Sun Yuanliang himself led the remnants westward in a desperate escape, but after being pursued by the People's Liberation Army and intercepted by local forces in the Yu-Wan-Su and Ji-Lu-Yu regions, they were all captured, with over 4,600 enemy soldiers taken alive. Currently, the People's Liberation Army is continuing to tighten the encirclement of the Qiu Qingquan and Li Mi corps, compressing them into a small area of ​​less than twenty li east to west and less than ten li north to south within the villages and towns of Qinglongji, Lishilin, and Zuo Zhai.

Xinhua News Agency, Huaihai Front, December 12th: The two army corps of Du Yuming's forces, heavily surrounded by the People's Liberation Army, are now facing a severe threat of starvation. Du's troops rely solely on aircraft to drop extremely limited quantities of food. Thousands upon thousands of soldiers are crowded into each village, with each soldier only able to eat an average of one sweet potato per day. After slaughtering and eating all the cattle, donkeys, pigs, sheep, dogs, chickens, and ducks belonging to the residents, they began slaughtering warhorses for food on the 9th. Not only is food extremely scarce, but the well water and spring water in some villages have been drunk dry.

Xinhua News Agency, Huaihai Front, December 13th: Hunger is accelerating the demise of the Huang Wei Corps. According to captured officers and soldiers from the 8th Regiment of the 114th Division of the 10th Army of said corps, as early as November 28th, all the cattle, pigs, and other livestock in the villages they occupied had been slaughtered and eaten clean. On the 29th, each person was only given three sweet potatoes for the entire day. Starting from the night of the 30th, the soldiers did not eat anything for two days. Wang Shunqing, a soldier from the 7th Company of the 2nd Battalion of the 8th Regiment of the New 3rd Division of the 10th Army, said: The New 3rd Division of the 10th Army, trapped in Zhang Weizi, had no food and ate sweet potatoes for five days, even eating the sweet potato roots. When mules and horses were killed by artillery shells, the bandit soldiers set up steel helmets to cook horse meat. They drank well water dry and then drank ditch and pit water; now the ditch water has been drunk dry, and even the mud paste is all that is left in the puddles south of the village. The prisoners also said: Although Chiang bandits dropped some cooked rice by plane, it was only allowed for officers above the battalion level to eat, and the soldiers could not get any. Everyone was so hungry that they would snatch anything dropped by the plane. The special service battalion of the corps headquarters opened fire to grab rice. Some bags of rice were dropped on the positions of the 18th Army, and a company of soldiers rushed up and ate it all. Afterwards, the company commander was punished, and three soldiers were shot. Now, the Chiang bandits are slaughtering the troops' livestock for food. Some Chiang bandit officers cried and said, "We are surrounded on all sides. We ate sweet potatoes a few days ago, and in a few days we will starve to death." However, the People's Liberation Army surrounding the enemy has not only abundant food but can also eat pork regularly. Because the meals are prepared so well, a fighter in the machine gun company of a certain unit said, "After annihilating Huang Wei, the cook should be given a great merit." This is a powerful temptation for the enemy. Mi Jitai, a worker in a certain battalion, shouted loudly to the enemy from the Xiaozhangzhuang position: "Come over and eat steamed buns." Several enemies on the opposite position immediately ran over with their hands raised high, and without saying a word after reaching the position, they grabbed the dry food and gnawed on it. Zhang Wenbin, the operations section chief of the captured 14th Army, asked for food as soon as he came over.

    徐州西南我军继续紧缩包围
    十天歼匪达八万余
    饥饿正加速着匪黄维兵团的覆灭
    【新华社淮海前线十二日电】被包围在永城东北的国民党军三个兵团，自二日到十二日，已经被消灭约八万多人。被消灭的八万多敌人内，包括孙元良第十六兵团两个军的全部。孙兵团七日突围时，即被歼灭大部，孙元良本人率残部继续往西奔逃，经解放军的追击及豫皖苏、冀鲁豫两区地方部队的截击，已全部捕获，生俘敌四千六百余名。现人民解放军对邱清泉、李弥两个兵团正继续紧缩包围圈，将其压缩在青龙集、李石林、左砦等村镇，东西不到二十里，南北不到十里的狭小地区内。
    【新华社淮海前线十二日电】被解放军重重包围的杜聿明部两个兵团，现正面临着饥饿的严重威胁。杜部每天只靠飞机投掷数量极少的粮食。每个村庄上拥挤着的成千成万的士兵，平均每天只能吃上一顿山芋。在将居民的牛、驴、猪、羊、狗、鸡、鸭等宰吃干净以后，九日起他们即开始杀战马充饥。不仅吃的东西已经极端困难，而且有的村庄井水泉水都喝干了。
    【新华社淮海前线十三日电】饥饿正加速着黄维兵团的覆灭。据该兵团第十军一一四师八团被俘的官兵说：早在上月廿八日就已将所住村庄的牛、猪等牲畜杀吃干净。廿九日整天，每人只分到三块红薯。卅日夜起，士兵们两天没有吃到任何东西。第十军新三师八团二营七连士兵王顺清说：困守在张围子的第十军新三师，没有粮食，吃了五天红薯，连红薯根都吃光了。骡马被炮弹打死，匪军们就架起钢盔烧马肉吃。井水喝干喝渠水坑水，现在渠水已喝干，连庄南的水坑也只剩下泥糊涂了。俘虏们又说：蒋匪虽由飞机投下一些煮熟的大米，但只准营以上的军官吃，士兵吃不到。大家饿得不行，只要见到飞机投下东西就乱抢。兵团部的特务营为了抢大米而开枪。有几袋大米丢到十八军阵地上，一个连的士兵一抢上去就吃光了。事后，该连连长受到处罚，三个士兵被枪毙。现在蒋匪正在杀食部队的牲口。有些蒋匪军官哭着说：“四面八方都围住了，前几天吃红薯，再过几天就要饿死。”而将敌军包围着的人民解放军，不但粮食丰富，还可经常吃到猪肉。因为伙食做得好，某部机炮连的战士说：“歼灭黄维后，要给炊事员记大功。”这对敌人是一种有力的诱惑。某营工作员米吉太在小张庄阵地上向敌人高喊：“过来吃蒸馍。”在对面阵地上马上就有几个敌人高举着双手跑过来，一到阵地里甚话也不说，抓着干粮就啃。被俘的十四军作战科长张文斌，一过来就向人要饭吃。
