Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th: Telegraphic Agency of the Soviet Union (TASS), Prague, 15th: Red Flag Right News recently published an interview with Italian Communist Party Vice-Chairman and Senate Vice-President Scoccimarro by the newspaper's reporter. When discussing the Italian economic situation after "Marshallization," Scoccimarro pointed out that three and a half years after the end of the war, Italy's production only reached 75% of that in 1938. The decline in production is the result of the anti-people fiscal and economic policies implemented by the De Gasperi government. This decline has intensified since the Communist Party and the Socialist Party were excluded from the government. Many people who thought that the Marshall Plan could restore the Italian economy are now deeply disappointed. Although we have sufficient raw materials and manpower, our production is restricted. With the restriction of production and the tax policies adopted by the government, not only have many small and medium-sized enterprises been destroyed, but also farm workers and peasants have been bankrupted. There are currently 2.5 million unemployed people in Italy, accounting for 12.5% of the total labor force. In addition, there are nearly five million industrial workers who only work part-time. Only about 1% of unemployed workers, i.e., 250,000 people, receive unemployment relief, which is not only lower than the minimum living requirements but also lasts only for the first six months of unemployment. The lives of civil servants are particularly difficult. Prices have increased 50 times compared to before the war, but civil servants' salary standards have only increased 20 times. More than half of all agricultural workers, i.e., 1.3 million people, are completely unemployed, and one million people only have six months of work throughout the year. Regarding the Italian political situation, Scoccimarro pointed out that the class struggle is rapidly intensifying. The people's rights guaranteed by the new constitution are not respected. De Gasperi is using the old Fascist codes in his anti-democratic policies. After the attempted assassination of Togliatti, the government not only did not arrest the Fascists but arrested 3,000 Communist Party members. While the government is covering up its servility to American imperialism and trying to create the impression that it is implementing its own Italian policies, government newspapers are constantly attacking the Soviet Union and people's democratic countries and supporting warmongers while concealing the Soviet Union's peace efforts. The De Gasperi government has officially admitted that it is prepared to hand over military bases in Italian colonies to the United States and Britain. But the people's resistance to war is growing. Scoccimarro emphasized that the great people's peace movement is the Italian people's response to the Western imperialists' attempts to drag Italy into their war plans and establish various blocs. Italian workers will never fight against the socialist Soviet Union.

　　“马歇尔计划”带来了灾难
    意失业者二百余万
    意共领袖斥政府追随美帝
    【新华社陕北廿日电】电通社布拉格十五日讯：红色权利报顷发表意大利共产党副主席及参院副议长斯科西马罗接见该报记者时的谈话。斯氏于谈及“马歇尔化”以后的意大利经济形势时指出，战争结束已三年半，意大利的生产却仅达一九三八年的百分之七十五。生产的下跌是加斯贝利政府实行反人民的财政经济政策的结果。这种下跌，在共产党和社会党被排出政府以后愈益加剧。许多以为经过马歇尔计划可以使意大利经济复原的人，现在深为失望。虽然我们有的是足够的原料和人力，但我们的生产却受到限制。随着限制生产和政府所采取的税收政策，不仅许多中小企业被毁灭，而且农场工人和农民也陷于破产。意大利现有失业者二百五十万人，为全部劳动人口的百分之十二点五。除此以外，还有差不多五百万的工业工人只工作部分时间。失业工人只有不过百分之一即二十五万人得到失业救济，这种救济不但低于最低生活所需，而且为期只限于失业的头六个月。特别困难的是公务人员的生活，物价较战前涨了五十倍，但公务员的薪资标准只上升了二十倍。全部农业工人有一半以上即一百三十万人完全失业，有一百万人则全年只有六个月有工作。论及意大利的政治形势时，斯科西马罗指出，阶级斗争正急剧尖锐化。新宪法所保障的人民权利，没有受到尊重。加斯贝利在其反民主的政策中使用的是法西斯老法典。在谋杀托格里亚蒂的事情发生之后，政府不但不逮捕法西斯分子，反而逮捕了三千名共产党员。当政府正在遮掩它对美国帝国主义的奴颜婢膝并力图造成印象，使人以为政府正在实行意大利自己的政策之时，政府报纸却不断地攻讦苏联和人民民主国家，支持战争挑拨者却隐瞒苏联的和平努力。加斯贝利政府正式承认，它准备将意大利殖民地的军事基地送交美英两国。但人民对战争的反抗正日益增涨。斯科西马罗强调指出：伟大的人民和平运动，是意大利人民对西方帝国主义者把意大利拖入他们的战争计划和建立各种集团之企图的回答。意大利工人决不对社会主义国家的苏联作战。
