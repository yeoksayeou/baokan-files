　　Taihang Dispatch: Chiang Bandit Troops in Northern Henan Have No Escape Route; Annihilation is Certain if They Do Not Surrender
　　[Taihang Electric Dispatch] A report from the Taihang Northern Henan Front Reporter Group: The Chiang bandit army in northern Henan, placing all its hopes on the "victory" of the Xuzhou Campaign, is now preparing to dream of fleeing south after being disappointed. On the 11th, a reporter interviewed General Shi Zhiben, Deputy Commander of the Northern Henan Corps of the People's Liberation Army, in a certain area on the front line regarding the situation in northern Henan. General Shi pointed out first: "The Kuomintang 40th Army attempting to flee south is dreaming. After our army liberated Xuzhou, on the 5th of this month, the Kuomintang army besieged in the isolated island of Xinxiang in northern Henan received Chiang Kai-shek's order to flee south. At that time, Li Chenxi (Deputy Commander of the Bandit 40th Army) knew that he could not escape by land and wanted Chiang Kai-shek to send planes for airlift, which is such a muddled idea; he forgot that Chiang Kai-shek sacrifices miscellaneous troops and would not be willing to spend such a large amount of capital. After that, they were still preparing for a hopeless escape. What is placed before them is the dragnet laid by the People's Liberation Army, the vast liberated areas, the impassable natural barrier of the Yellow River, and they are all northerners, who would be willing to continue to go south to risk their lives for Chiang Kai-shek?" General Shi continued in a firm and confident tone: "As long as the enemy's planes dare to land, we will not allow them to fly into the sky again; if the enemy really escapes from the land, we will resolutely eliminate them in Xinxiang city or on the Yellow River滩. There is only one way to find a way out, that is, lay down your weapons and stand on the side of the people." Finally, General Shi revealed a victorious smile and said: "If the enemy dares to flee south, the day when we completely annihilate the Chiang bandits in northern Henan and completely liberate the people of northern Henan will come more quickly!"

　　豫北蒋匪逃跑无路
  　如不投降定遭歼灭
    【太行电】太行豫北前线记者团报导：把一切希望寄托在徐州会战“胜利”的豫北蒋匪军，现正失望的准备梦想弃城南窜。十一日记者曾就豫北形势，在前线某地走访人民解放军豫北兵团副司令员石志本将军。石将军首先指出：“企图南窜的国民党四十军是在做梦。当我军解放徐州后，本月五日困守豫北新乡孤岛的国民党军就接到蒋介石给他向南逃窜的命令，当时李晨熙（匪四十军副军长）明知陆上逃跑不了，想要蒋介石派飞机空运，这是多么糊涂的想法；他忘记了蒋介石牺牲杂牌军，那里会舍得下那么大的资本。此后，他们仍作没有希望的逃跑的准备，摆在他们面前的有解放军布置的天罗地网，有广大的解放区，有突不过去的黄河天险，而且他们也都是北方人，谁愿继续到南方去为蒋介石拼命送死呢？”石将军继以坚定而又自信语调说：“只要敌人的飞机敢于着陆，我们就不准它再飞向天空；如果敌人真的从陆地上逃跑，我们则坚决的把他消灭在新乡城内或黄河滩上。要想找活路只有一条，即放下武器，站到人民方面来。”最后石将军流露着胜利的笑声说：“如果敌人胆敢南窜，则我全部歼灭豫北蒋匪，完全解放豫北人民之日，也就会更迅速的到来！”
