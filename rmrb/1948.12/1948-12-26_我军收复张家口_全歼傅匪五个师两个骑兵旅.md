[Xinhua News Agency, Ping-Sui Front, Urgent Dispatch, 24th] The North China People's Liberation Army captured Zhangjiakou, the important strategic city and capital of Chahar Province, at 11 p.m. on the 23rd. The defending enemy, Fu Zuoyi's bandit army, Sun Lanfeng's 105th Army consisting of four divisions, the 104th Army consisting of one division, and two cavalry brigades, were mostly annihilated in the northeast area of Zhangjiakou after a small portion was wiped out in the urban area by the People's Liberation Army, completely annihilated at 3 p.m. on the 24th.

　　The battle on the outskirts of Zhangjiakou began at the end of last month. The People's Liberation Army, which suddenly returned to the outskirts of Zhangjiakou from the western section of Ping-Sui Railway, occupied Wanquan and Huaian in the northwest and southwest of Zhangjiakou on the 29th and 30th of last month. On the 7th of this month, it occupied Xuanhua in the southeast of Zhangjiakou and the four suburbs of Zhangjiakou City. On the 15th, it occupied Zhangbei to the north of Zhangjiakou. The completely isolated defenders of Zhangjiakou, immediately after the annihilation of the 35th Army defending Xinbaoan on the evening of the 22nd, began to break out from the northeast corner of the city on the morning of the 23rd and were surrounded by the People's Liberation Army in the area of Xidianzi, Chaotianwa, Wulahada, Huangtuyaozi, and Beiyingzi in the northeast of the city. The People's Liberation Army completely cleared the remaining enemy in the urban area on the night of the 23rd, and after 20 hours of fierce fighting, completely annihilated the enemy who broke out at 3 p.m. today. The recovery of Zhangjiakou reminds people of its colorful history. During the period of Japanese occupation, it was the capital of the puppet Mengjiang government. In September 1945, it was recaptured from the Japanese and puppet troops by the heroic People's Liberation Army and became the capital of the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region, and it became famous at home and abroad because of the efforts of the People's Government in construction. The seizure of Zhangjiakou by the Kuomintang war criminals Chiang Kai-shek and Fu Zuoyi was on October 11, 1946. At this time, the Kuomintang reactionaries were at the peak of launching a full-scale offensive against the Liberated Areas. They refused the Chinese Communist Party's warning to stop the offensive against Zhangjiakou in advance, and afterwards, on October 12, the day after occupying Zhangjiakou, Chiang Kai-shek issued an order to convene a bogus National Assembly. On October 13, the Yan'an Liberation Daily wrote an editorial saying: "All the troops and all the people in our entire Liberated Areas must thoroughly crush Chiang Kai-shek's offensive and recover Zhangjiakou, Chengde, Jining, Heze, Huaiyin and all the lost territories, and all the evils of Chiang Kai-shek today will surely bear their own fruit." Every sentence of this promise has now been fulfilled. The Huaihai Campaign and the Pingjin Campaign in the victorious development of the People's Liberation Army are accelerating the demise of Chiang Kai-shek and Fu Zuoyi. Of the 48 regular divisions commanded by Fu Zuoyi in the areas of Peiping, Tianjin, Zhangjiakou, and Tanggu, 14 entire divisions have been lost in the 17 days from the 7th to the 24th of this month, and 12 of the 17 divisions owned by the Fu faction have been lost. Fu Zuoyi is a public enemy of the people of North China, a mass murderer, and extremely sinful. He is a top war criminal in the same position as Chiang Kai-shek, Li Zongren, Bai Chongxi, He Yingqin, Chen Cheng, Hu Zongnan, Yan Xishan, etc. The Chinese people will surely give him the punishment he deserves. It is impossible for Fu Zuoyi to escape this punishment; it is still possible to slightly reduce this punishment, that is, by ordering the entire army in Peiping and Tianjin to cease resistance, surrender their weapons, and guarantee that they will no longer endanger the lives of the revolutionary people in Peiping and Tianjin, and no longer destroy the public and private property and weapons and ammunition in Peiping and Tianjin.

### 我军收复张家口  全歼傅匪五个师两个骑兵旅

　　我军收复张家口
    全歼傅匪五个师两个骑兵旅
    【新华社平绥前线二十四日急电】华北人民解放军于二十三日夜十一时攻克重要的战略城市察哈尔省会张家口，守敌傅作义匪军孙兰峰部一零五军四个师，一零四军一个师和两个骑兵旅，除小部在市区被歼外，大部都被包围在张家口东北地区，而在二十四日下午三时被完全歼灭。
    张家口的外围战，开始于上月底。由平绥西段突然回到张家口外围的解放军，在上月二十九日和三十日占领了张家口西北和西南的万全和怀安，本月七日占领张家口东南的宣化和张市的四郊，十五日占领张家口以北的张北。完全孤立的张家口守敌，紧接在二十二日晚间新保安守敌三十五军被歼之后，在二十三日晨开始由该市东北角向外突围，而在该市东北的西店子、朝天洼、乌拉哈达、黄土窑子、北营子一带被解放军所包围。解放军于廿三日夜完全肃清市区残敌，并经二十小时的激战于本日下午三时完全歼灭突围之敌。张家口的收复使人们回想起它的富于色彩的历史。在被日本侵占时期它是伪蒙疆政府的首都。一九四五年九月它被英勇的人民解放军从日伪军手中夺回，成为晋察冀边区的首府，并因人民政府的努力建设而著名于中外。国民党内战罪犯蒋介石和傅作义的夺取张家口，是在一九四六年十月十一日。这时国民党反动派正处于向解放区实行全面进攻的高峰，他们在事前拒绝了中国共产党停止进攻张家口的警告，而在事后，在十月十二日，即占领张家口的第二天，蒋介石就下了召集伪国民大会的命令。十月十三日，延安解放日报曾为此写了社论说：“我们全解放区的一切军队，一切人民，一定要彻底粉碎蒋介石的进攻，收复张家口、承德、集宁、荷泽、淮阴以及一切失地，而蒋介石今天的一切罪恶必将自食其果。”这个诺言，现在每一句都应验了。人民解放军的胜利发展中的淮海战役和平津战役，正在加速蒋介石和傅作义的灭亡。傅作义在北平、天津、张家口、塘沽地区所指挥的四十八个正规师，在本月七日到二十四日的十七日中，已经丧失了十四个整师，而傅系共有的十七个师，则已经丧失了十二个。傅作义是华北人民的公敌，杀人如麻，罪大恶极，是和蒋介石、李宗仁、白崇禧、何应钦、陈诚、胡宗南、阎锡山等人处于同一地位的头等战争罪犯，中国人民必将给以应得的惩处。傅作义如欲逃脱这一惩处，那是不可能的；略为减轻这一惩处则还有可能，这即是由他下令平津全军不再抵抗，缴械投诚，并保证不再危害平津革命人民的生命，不再破坏平津公私财产及武器弹药。（附图片）
