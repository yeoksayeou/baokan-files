　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th. U.S. imperialist forces have further encroached on India. According to a TASS dispatch from New Delhi: American capital exports to India have greatly increased recently. Many newly established Indian companies are invested in by the United States, including "India Steam Navigation Company" (which claims to be India's first privately-owned shipbuilding company) and "India Newspaper Trust." The United States also has a large amount of investment in India's chemical and bakelite manufacturing industries. The further encroachment of American capital into India is directly related to the negotiations between India and the United States regarding the conclusion of a treaty of friendship, trade, and navigation.

　　美帝国主义势力进一步侵入印度
    【新华社陕北二十六日电】美帝国主义势力已进一步侵入印度。据塔斯社新德里消息：美国对印度的资本输出，近来大大增多。许多新设立的印度公司，都是由美国投资的，其中包括：“印度轮航公司”（该公司自称为印度第一家民营的造船公司）和“印度报业托辣斯”。在印度的化学品制造业及电木品制造业中，美国也有大量的投资。美国资本的进一步侵入印度，系与印度和美国之间关于缔结友好贸易及航海条约的谈判有直接关系。
