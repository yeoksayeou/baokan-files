Xinhua News Agency, Luoyang, 23rd – The number of children enrolling in primary schools in Luoyang City this fall semester has increased by nearly twofold compared to last semester. At the end of last semester, the city had seven municipal primary schools and three private primary schools, with 1,900 students and 94 faculty and staff members. To date, the city's municipal complete primary schools have increased to nine, private primary schools have increased to five, the number of enrolled children has increased to more than 5,550, and the number of faculty and staff members has increased to 200. One of the important reasons for the development of primary school education in the city is the large-scale enrollment of children from poor families after liberation. The primary school in Xigong, Luoyang, was completely inaccessible to children from poor families under the rule of the Kuomintang. Now, children from poor families account for 70 percent of the school's students. Liuyingzhen Primary School in Xiguan had only about 60 students from landlord families before liberation. Now, due to the large-scale enrollment of children from poor families, the number of students has increased to more than 270. The vast majority of the faculty and staff members in various schools are local former faculty and staff members and clerks. A large number of them have also undergone short-term study of the theory of New Democratic cultural education. In terms of secondary education, Luoyang Middle School currently has more than 400 students. The private Luze Middle School also resumed classes on November 15. The first batch of teachers and students from Luoyang Middle School, Luoyang Normal School, and Luoyang Agricultural Vocational School, who were threatened and deceived by the Kuomintang to move to Kaifeng, returned to Luoyang on December 8. The Luoyang Municipal Government's Bureau of Culture and Education is helping the schools prepare for the resumption of classes.

　　洛阳小学学生人数较上学期增加两倍
    【新华社洛阳二十三日电】洛阳市各小学今年下学期的入学儿童，较上学期增加将近两倍。今年上学期结束时，全市有市立小学七处，私立小学三处，学生有一千九百人，教职员九十四人。到目前止，全市市立完小已增至九处，私立小学增至五处，入学儿童增至五千五百五十余人，教职员增至二百人。该市小学教育发展的重要原因之一，是解放后广大贫苦市民的子女大量入学。洛阳西工的小学，在国民党统治时，贫苦子弟根本不能入内，现在该校学生中贫苦子弟则占百分之七十。西关柳营镇小学，解放前只有当家子弟六十余名，现在因贫苦子弟大量入学，学生已增加到二百七十余人。各校的教职员绝大多数是本地旧教职员和分务员。他们中间并有大部分人对新民主主义文化教育的理论进行了短期学习。在中学教育方面，洛阳中学现有学生四百余人。私立潞泽中学亦于十一月十五日复课。前被国民党威胁欺骗迁往开封的洛阳中学、洛阳师范、洛阳农艺职业学校的教员和学生，首批已于十二月八日返回洛阳。洛阳市政府文教局正帮助各校筹备复课。
