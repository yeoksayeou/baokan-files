    Xinhua News Agency, Huaihai Front, December 12th: The great encirclement battle against the three corps commanded by Du Yuming, southwest of Xiaoxian and northeast of Yongcheng, is continuing to develop. According to incomplete statistics, since December 2nd to 8th, the People's Liberation Army (PLA) has annihilated over 30 regiments of the surrounded enemy. After annihilating most of Sun Yuanliang's corps, the PLA captured strongholds such as Wangyuan, Xiazhai, Liuji, Miaozhuang, Jiangzhuang, and Yanzhuang on the 7th and 8th, annihilating one regiment of the 58th Division of the 74th Corps, the regimental headquarters and four infantry battalions and one engineer battalion of the 8th Regiment of the 3rd Division of the 9th Corps, and one battalion of the 200th Division of the 5th Corps. More than 500 men of the artillery battalion of the 46th Division of the same corps, led by Battalion Commander Cao Shoushan and Deputy Battalion Commander Zhang Zongkuan, surrendered to the PLA with four Japanese-style howitzers. At noon on the 8th, the main force of the 70th Corps and a part of the 74th Corps, totaling about nine regiments, and attached tank units, attempted to break through the PLA's positions at Lulou and escape south. The PLA immediately counterattacked, and within only three hours, the enemy was defeated, with over 5,000 killed or wounded and two enemy tanks destroyed. The enemy failed to cross the PLA's encirclement line. The enemy, like Huang Wei's corps, is now facing serious difficulties of lack of ammunition and food. Li Mi's corps had no food on the entire day of the 8th.
    Xinhua News Agency, Huaihai Front, December 12th: The Kuomintang Huang Wei's 12th Corps, besieged in the narrow area of Shuangduiji southwest of Suxian, has been largely annihilated after days of attacks by our army. The corps has four armies. The main force of the 110th Division of the 85th Army, led by Wu Shaozhou, except for the division headquarters and its two regiments, which have already revolted under the leadership of General Liao Yunzhou, another regiment has been annihilated on the 8th. The headquarters and remnant troops of two regiments of the 23rd Division of the same army, and the field artillery battalion of the army's direct units, led by Huang Zihua, commander of the 23rd Division, surrendered to our army on the evening of the 10th. The mountain artillery battalion and the engineer battalion of the army's direct units have also been completely annihilated. Now only a small number of personnel remain in the army headquarters. The Xiong Shouchun's 14th Army has also been largely wiped out, with only 2,000 men remaining at Yangweizi, northeast of Shuangdui. The Tan Daoshan's 10th Army has had four entire regiments annihilated, and the rest of the troops have also suffered heavy casualties, with less than one-third remaining. The elite 18th Army Yang Botao unit, on which Huang Wei's corps finally relied, has now been more than halved. Its 49th Division has been largely wiped out, and the remaining two divisions had lost one-third of their strength by the 8th. On the night of the 9th, our army captured Dawangzhuang south of Shuangduiji, annihilating two battalions of the 33rd Regiment of the 11th Division. On the 10th, the army gathered four regiments and launched a counterattack on Dawangzhuang under the cover of more than ten tanks and airplanes, but retreated after suffering more than 3,000 casualties. After all attempts to break through failed, Huang Wei's corps is now facing the same fate as the Huang Botao corps, which was annihilated east of Xuzhou on November 22nd. The Li Yannian corps, which Huang Wei's corps had been hoping for to relieve the siege, is still blocked by the powerful PLA on the southeast line of Baojiaji and Gaowangji north of the Fei River, eighty li away from Shuangduiji, one times farther than the distance from which the Qiu Qingquan and Li Mi corps had attempted to relieve the siege of Huang Botao's corps.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, December 12th: According to enemy prisoners of war from the Huaihai front, the besieged Huang Wei's corps will release poison gas against the PLA on or after the 12th. This is part of Chiang Kai-shek's gang's vicious plan; Chiang Kai-shek has decided that when the Huaihai battle situation and the Yangtze River line are in danger, he will release poison gas against the PLA. For this purpose, he ordered the Central News Agency and Kuomintang newspapers in Nanjing and Shanghai to spread rumors about the PLA releasing poison gas. Yan Xishan's bandit army also released asphyxiating poison gas on the 26th of last month on the position from Jiehuawan to Naomacun in the southeast of Taiyuan City. Kuomintang prisoners of war said that such shameless crimes cannot prevent their military defeat. All poison gas criminals will be severely punished by the PLA.

    徐州西南大围歼战胜利发展
    我歼敌已逾三十个团
    宿县西南黄维兵团大部被歼
    【新华社淮海前线十二日电】萧县西南永城东北对于杜聿明所指挥的三个兵团的大围歼战，正继续发展中。据不完全统计，自二日至八日，解放军歼灭被围之敌已超过卅个团。在歼灭孙元良兵团大部后，解放军七、八两日又攻克王园、夏寨、刘集、苗庄、蒋庄、阎庄等据点，歼敌七十四军五十八师一个团，第九军第三师第八团团部及该师步兵四个营、工兵一个营，第五军二百师的一个营。该军四十六师一个炮兵营五百余人，在营长曹寿山、副营长张宗宽率领下携日式曲射炮四门向解放军投诚。八日午，七十军主力及七十四军一部共约九个团，并附战车部队，妄图突破鲁楼解放军阵地向南突围逃窜，解放军当予反击，仅三小时即将敌击溃，毙伤敌五千余人，击毁敌坦克二辆，敌始终未能越出解放军包围圈一步，该敌现与黄维兵团同样面对着缺弹缺粮的严重困难。李弥兵团在八日全日没有吃饭。
    【新华社淮海前线十二日电】被围于宿县西南双堆集狭小地区之国民党黄维第十二兵团，经我军连日攻击，已经大部被歼。该兵团共四个军，其八十五军吴绍周部之主力一一零师，除师部及所属两个团已在师长廖运周将军率领下起义外，其另一个团已在八日被歼灭。该军廿三师师部，所属两个团残部，及军直属队之野炮营，已由廿三师师长黄子华率领于十日晚向我军投降。该军直属队之山炮营、工兵营亦已全部被歼。现该军已只剩军部少数人员。其十四军熊绶春部亦已大部消灭，只剩两千人缩于双堆东北之杨围子一点。其十军覃道善部已被歼四个整团，余部亦伤亡惨重，所剩不足三分之一。黄维兵团所最后依靠的精锐十八军杨伯涛部现亦被歼过半。其四十九师已大部被歼，其余两个师至八日即已损失三分之一。九日夜我军攻占双堆集以南之大王庄，歼其十一师卅三团两个营。十日该军集结四个团在十余辆坦克和飞机掩护下向大王庄反扑，在伤亡三千余人后败退。在一切突围企图均告失败以后，黄维兵团现正面对着与上月廿二日在徐州以东被歼灭的黄伯韬兵团同样的命运。黄维兵团所终日盼望的前来解围的李延年兵团，仍被强大的解放军阻于淝水以北的包家集、高王集一线之东南，距双堆集还有八十里，比前此邱清泉、李弥两兵团离开其所曾妄图解围的黄伯韬兵团还要远一倍。
    【新华社陕北十二日电】据淮海前线敌俘供称，被围之黄维兵团将于十二日或以后向解放军施放毒气。这是蒋介石匪帮凶恶计划的一部分；蒋介石曾决定：在淮海战局与长江一线危急时，将向解放军施放毒气，并为此目的，令其中央社及国民党京沪报纸散布解放军放毒的谣言。阎锡山匪军在上月二十六日亦曾在太原城东南界花湾至淖马村阵地施放窒息性毒气。国民党战俘称无耻的罪行决不能阻止其军事的失败。所有放毒凶犯，必将受到解放军的严厉惩办。
