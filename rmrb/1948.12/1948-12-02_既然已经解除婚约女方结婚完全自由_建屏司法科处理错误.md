　　Since the Engagement Has Been Annulled, the Woman Has Complete Freedom to Marry
  　Jianping Judicial Section’s Handling Was Incorrect
    To the Editor:
    There was a woman who had a relationship with another man after her husband left to join the army. Two years ago, her husband returned, and due to discord in the family, they divorced in the county. After the divorce, she immediately officially married the man with whom she had previously had an illicit relationship. The county believed that they had committed adultery, that the marriage was illegal, confiscated their marriage certificate, and forced them to separate. Half a year later, they remarried, and the county again notified the village that they were not allowed to marry and summoned them to the county. The two of them temporarily took refuge at a relative's house, but were later arrested and sentenced to imprisonment, on the grounds that they were adulterers who had been subject to judicial punishment and were therefore legally unable to marry. Therefore, we raise the following two questions:
    (1) According to the specific facts and circumstances described above, is the county government's judicial section's handling of this matter appropriate?
    (2) Does Article 9 of Chapter 2 of the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region Marriage Regulations, which states that "those divorced by judgment or sentenced due to adultery shall not marry the adulterer," conflict in principle with our liberated area's marriage policy?
    Please provide a clear answer from the North China Government's judicial organs.

    Answer: Article 9 of Chapter 2 of the former Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region Marriage Regulations, which states that "those divorced by judgment or sentenced due to adultery shall not marry the adulterer," is, in today's view, worthy of reconsideration. Even if "before the promulgation of the new law, the old law remains valid," but the county judged that the man and woman divorced due to family discord, and the woman was not sentenced due to adultery, then the woman has complete freedom to remarry after the divorce. The former husband has no right to interfere, and the county government should not consider the woman's remarriage to be illegal, confiscate her marriage certificate and force them to separate; especially should it not arrest and sentence her to imprisonment. This violates the people's democratic rights and the principle of freedom of marriage. If there are no other new materials in this case, the county government should cancel the judgment, restore her freedom, and approve her marriage as legal.

### 既然已经解除婚约女方结婚完全自由　建屏司法科处理错误

　　既然已经解除婚约女方结婚完全自由
  　建屏司法科处理错误编辑同志：
    有一个妇女，在她丈夫出外参军后，曾与别人发生过男女关系，前年她丈夫回来，因家庭不和，两人到县里离了婚。离婚后，她随即和前曾与她有过不合法关系的男人正式结婚。县里认为他二人曾经通奸，结婚是不合法的，没收了结婚证，迫令离开。半年后他二人再次结婚，县里又通知村里不准许他二人结婚，并传到县。他二人到亲戚家暂避一时，后经逮捕归案，判处徒刑，理由是他二人是受过司法处分的通奸犯，依法自不能结婚。因此我们提出下列两个问题：
    （一）按照以上具体事实经过情形，县政府司法科对此问题的处理是否妥当？
    （二）晋察冀边区婚姻条例第二章第九条“因奸经判决离婚，或受刑之宣告者，不得与相奸者结婚”一条，与我们解放区之婚姻政策是否有原则上之抵触？
    请华北政府司法机关给以明确答复。
    建屏南庄工作组
    答：前晋察冀边区婚姻条例第二章第九条“因奸经判决离婚或受刑之宣告者，不得与相奸者结婚”之规定，在今天看来，值得重新考虑。即使因“新法未颁发前，旧法依然有效”，但该男女两方经县判系因家庭不和而离婚，女方并未受因奸处刑之宣告，那么女方于离婚后，就有另行结婚的完全自由。原夫无权干涉，县政府更不应该认为女方另行结婚为不合法，没收其结婚证而迫令离开；尤其不应该加以逮捕，并判处徒刑。这是违背人民民主权利及婚姻自由原则的。如果此案没有其他新材料，该县政府应取消该判决，恢复其自由，批准其婚姻为合法。
