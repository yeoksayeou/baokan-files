Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th. Reports from various sources: The Indonesian people have already taken up arms and bravely resisted the new offensive by the Dutch aggressors, who are equipped and supplied by U.S. imperialism. Although the Dutch authorities in Java are strictly censoring outgoing telegrams, news of popular uprisings in many parts of East and West Java has reached the Netherlands. This news was also confirmed by the Indonesian representative to the Security Council, Sudjarwo Tjondronegoro. He said: The Indonesian "people have risen up against the Dutch occupation forces. Currently, fighting is taking place in Kuningan, Tasikmalaya, and Bojonegoro in West Java, and Bondowoso and Probolinggo in East Java." Agence France-Presse reported on the 22nd, citing the Chinese newspaper "Sin Po" in Batavia: "Fighting is taking place around Yogyakarta."

On the other hand, due to the Dutch army's premeditated and organized despicable surprise attack, and due to the Hatta government's pro-American, anti-communist stance and lack of preparation for the new Dutch offensive, the Dutch army has now occupied large areas of Indonesia's already reduced territory and is approaching Yogyakarta from the west, north, and east. The Dutch army is advancing in five routes in Java. As of the 22nd, its western route (advancing along the Batavia-Yogyakarta railway) had reached Purworejo, a city 37 kilometers west of Yogyakarta. The northern route advanced south from Salatiga (northwest of Solo), south of Semarang, cutting off the railway between Yogyakarta and Solo, occupying the sugar refining center of Delanggu, 15 kilometers southwest of Solo; and advanced towards Yogyakarta and Solo. The northwest route of the Dutch army landed west of Surabaya and split into two routes. One route advanced southwest, occupying Cepu, the largest oilfield center in Java; the other route advanced west along the coast, occupying the port of Tuban, Rembang (the second largest port controlled by the Indonesian government on the north coast of Java), and Pati. The fifth route advanced west from south of Surabaya, occupying some small and medium-sized cities south and southwest of Malang. In Sumatra, the Dutch army advanced south from Medan and has occupied the entire province of Asahan, south of Medan. The Dutch army, which attacked east from Padang on the west coast of the island, has occupied Sawahlunto. Bukittinggi (the Indonesian capital in Sumatra), 65 kilometers north of Padang, has also been occupied by the Dutch army.

　　反对帝国主义·摈弃卖国政府
  　印尼人民奋勇抗战
    抵抗荷帝新侵略进攻
    【新华社陕北二十六日电】各方报导：印尼人民已经手执武器奋起抵抗由美帝国主义装备和供养的荷兰侵略者的新进攻。尽管在爪哇的荷兰当局对发出的电讯施行严格检查，但东、西爪哇许多地方爆发人民起义的消息，已传抵荷兰。此一消息并为印尼驻安理会代表苏加托莫柯所证实。他说：印尼“人民已起来反对荷兰占领军，目前，在西爪哇的库宁干、塔西克拉玛、布伊亭卓与东爪哇的邦都沃索、普罗波林哥等地，战事皆在进行”。法新社二十二日引巴达维亚中国报纸“新报”的报导说：“战事在日惹周围进行。”
    另一方面，由于荷军采取有准备有组织的卑鄙突袭，由于哈达政府的媚美反共及对荷兰新进攻的毫无准备，荷军现已侵占印尼业已缩小的领土中的大块地区，并正自西、北、东三面逼近日惹。荷军在爪哇计分五路前进。截至二十二日止，其西路（沿巴达维亚至日惹的铁路前进）已抵日惹以西三十七公里的普俄里约城。北路由三宝珑以南的萨拉蒂加（梭罗西北）南下，切断日惹与梭罗间的铁路，占领梭罗西南十五公里的炼糖中心狄朗哥城；并分向日惹与梭罗前进。西北路荷军在泗水以西登陆后、分为两路。一路向西南前进，占领爪哇最大油田中心芝普城；另路沿海岸西进，占领爪哇北岸的厨关港、南望港（印尼政府在爪哇北岸控制的第二大港）及巴蒂城。第五路自泗水以南向西进，占领玛琅以南和西南的一些中小城市。在苏门答腊方面，荷军一路自棉兰南下，已占领棉兰以南的亚沙汗全省。自该岛西岸巴东港向东进攻的荷军，已占领梭碌，巴东以北六十五公里的布齐亭基（印尼在苏岛的首府），亦已为荷军占领。
