    △ In British Cyprus, in the eastern Mediterranean, all left-wing workers went on strike for two hours on the 16th in solidarity with the more than one hundred trade union leaders and members imprisoned for political crimes. The Labor League issued a statement saying that the strike was the beginning of a great struggle for constitutional freedom and autonomous government. Demonstrators carried anti-government slogans through the streets.
    △ According to statistics published by the Italian General Confederation of Labor, the percentage of government employees nationwide who participated in the December 20 strike ranged from 60 to 70 percent. Despite the government's efforts to suppress the strike, it almost completely paralyzed Italy's rail transport and postal services. [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 28th]
