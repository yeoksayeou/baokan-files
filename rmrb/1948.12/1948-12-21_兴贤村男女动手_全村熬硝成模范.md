　　【Jizhong News】The people of Xingxian Village, Anping District, have relied on boiling saltpeter in recent years, which has not only solved their livelihood problems, but has also enabled some to become rich. Especially this year, when floods caused disasters and most of the village's crops were submerged, the harvested grain was barely enough to survive the winter. Under the government's call for "self-reliance through production," 167 out of the village's 178 households actively engaged in scraping soil and boiling saltpeter. According to statistics from September 1st to October 31st, they sold more than 98,600 yuan (new currency). There were also 1,420 cartloads of saltpeter soil. This has solved the livelihood difficulties of the entire village.
    Women are even more enthusiastic about boiling saltpeter. Out of the 135 women in the village who can participate in labor, 114 are scraping soil and boiling saltpeter. Zhang Guirong, a strong young woman, scraped the soil herself and carried it home in baskets. In the forty days from August 17th to September 28th, she scraped 392 baskets of soil, produced 143 jin of saltpeter, and 240 jin of salt, selling them for a total of more than 20,000 yuan. Xu Guixiang, a military dependent in her sixties, takes care of sweeping soil, carrying water, and filling the ponds all by herself, and her skills are higher than those of ordinary men.
    When boiling saltpeter, the villagers naturally formed mutual aid groups in order to reduce the occupation of furniture. The 167 households that boil saltpeter share 17 ponds and 51 initial-print pots. Everyone is accommodating each other, with the ponds running day and night. During the boiling process, skilled workers also helped novices.
    This village has benefited greatly from boiling saltpeter, so the masses are spreading a saying: "There are thousands of professions in the world, but none is as good as boiling saltpeter!" In addition to solving livelihood difficulties, this year the village has built fifteen new brick houses by relying on boiling saltpeter. Zhang Gang, Zhang Yi, Fu Lanzhu and other fifteen families have also purchased fifteen new flatbed carts. The You Laorong family of twelve scrapes soil together as a family, and in the past three or four years, they have built seven houses and bought a large cart and a mill with the money earned from scraping soil and boiling saltpeter.
    This village not only produces a lot of saltpeter, but also of good quality. Therefore, in the active boiling of saltpeter for more than a month after the autumn harvest, they won the title of "Model Village for Saltpeter Production" in the county, and the County Fire Saltpeter Bureau awarded them a glorious banner of "Model Village for Saltpeter Production." Now they have also organized a saltpeter workers' union and elected Xu Modiu, who is fair in his work, experienced in boiling saltpeter, and active in labor, as the director of the saltpeter workers' union.
    Now the villagers are even more enthusiastic about scraping soil, often getting up in the middle of the night to scrape soil, and some even go out of the village to scrape.

　　兴贤村男女动手
    全村熬硝成模范
    【冀中讯】安平城区兴贤村群众，近年来依靠熬硝，不但解决了生活问题，并有的做到了发家致富。特别是今年水涝成灾，全村的庄稼大部被淹，打的粮食多的只能闹个冬饱。该村群众在政府“生产自救”的号召下，全村一百七十八户就有一百六十七户都积极的进行刮土熬硝。从九月一日到十月三十一日的统计，就卖了九万八千六百余元（新币）。还有一千四百二十车硝土。这样一来，解决了全村群众生活上的困难。
    妇女们熬硝更起劲。全村一百三十五个能参加劳动的妇女，就有一百一十四个刮土熬硝的。壮年妇女张贵荣，自己刮了土，自己还得用筐往家背，从八月十七到九月二十八四十天的工夫，就刮了三百九十二筐土，出了一百四十三斤硝，二百四十斤盐，共卖了二万余元。六十多岁的军属徐贵香，扫土、挑水、填装池子，都是她自个的事，手艺比一般的男子都高。
    这村群众在熬硝的时候，为了少占家具，都自然的形成了互助小组。一百六十七户熬硝的，伙用着十七个池子，五十一个初印锅。大伙互相尽让着，歇人不歇马，池子黑夜白日不闲着，在熬硝的时候，还作到了熟手帮助生手。
    这村熬硝沾光挺大，所以群众流传着一句话：“世上有万行、哪行也不如熬硝强！”除了解决了生活困难以外，今年这村靠熬硝盖了十五间新砖房，张纲、张义、傅兰柱等十五家，还置买了十五辆新小平车。尤老荣全家十二口人，一家子全刮土，三、四年来，用刮土熬硝赚的钱，就盖了七间房，还置买了一辆大车一盘磨。
    这村不但出硝多，而且质量好，所以他们在秋后这一个多月的积极熬硝中，就荣获了全县“产硝模范村”的称号，县火硝局奖给了他们“产硝模范村”的一面光荣旗。现在他们又组织起了硝工会，选出了作事公正、熬硝有经验、劳动积极的徐摸丢为硝工会主任。
    现在这村群众刮土更起劲了，多是半夜里就起来刮土，还有的出村去刮。
