[Report from this newspaper] Many areas in North China have successively formulated winter water conservancy construction plans and are currently working hard to carry them out. The Fifth Special District of Northern Yue plans to open 16 new canals and repair 6 old canals in Tang, Wan, Lai, and Yi counties. The Fourth Special District requires all counties to repair all large and small canals damaged by water and滩地 [tāndì, river flats] that can be repaired this winter to ensure that water is not delayed next spring. The North China Water Conservancy Survey Team has recently completed the water conservancy survey of Shanyin, Yingxian, and Fuyu counties in the Northern Yue District. The Jiluyu Administrative Office has also dispatched water conservancy surveying and mapping personnel to the countryside to conduct river surveys. In addition, some areas have begun to build new canals and repair old canals. For example, Shengba County (newly established county) in central Hebei used natural conditions to complete a new canal, which can irrigate 123,241 mu of land. It is estimated that each mu can increase production by 3 shi and dou next year, for a total increase of more than 36,000 shi. The Hunyuan Municipal Government of Northern Yue, in cooperation with the Minsheng Canal Water Conservancy Committee, organized the masses in the Tianjiahao area to complete a canal 8 chi wide, 3 chi deep, and 250 zhang long in four days, which can irrigate more than 400 mu of land. Next year, each mu can increase production by 4 da dou, turning the alkaline land in this area into fertile land. Nantangshan in Yingxian County has completed a canal 1 zhang 1 chi wide, 8 chi deep, and 765 bu long, which can silt 842 mu of land and irrigate 1,100 mu of land. Various regions have also formulated specific plans for digging wells and increasing and repairing waterwheels, and some have already begun to take action. After the Central Hebei Administrative Office called for digging and repairing wells and adding and repairing waterwheels in winter, 64 households in Xibulogang, Dingxian County, jointly bought 10 waterwheels. Heluzhuang Village in Shulu County is repairing old waterwheels. Under the promotion of the working group, the masses in Licun, Boye County, have organized groups to dig new wells, repair old wells, and repair waterwheels, and are carrying out the work of repairing water wells.

　　北岳冀中不少地区
  　趁冬闲兴修水利准备明年大生产
    【本报讯】华北不少地区已先后拟定冬季兴修水利计划，并正抓紧进行中。北岳五专区计划在唐、完、涞、易等县开新渠十六道，修旧渠六道。四专区要求各县今冬把所有被水冲毁的大小渠道和可能修复的滩地予以修复，保证明春不误使水。华北水利测量队已于最近将北岳区之山阴、应县、富由水利测量完毕。冀鲁豫行署也派遣水利测绘人员分别下乡，进行河道勘测。另外有的地区已开始建设新渠和修理旧渠。如冀中胜霸县（新设县）利用自然条件完成新渠一道，能浇地十二万三千二百四十一亩，估计明年每亩可增产三市斗，总计能增产三万六千余石。北岳浑源市政府协同民生渠水利委员会，在田家号一带组织群众在四天中完成了宽八尺、深三尺、长二百五十丈的一道渠，可浇地四百余亩，明年每亩可增产四大斗。使这一带的碱地变成了良田。应县南唐山已完成了宽一丈一尺、深八尺、长七百六十五步的水渠，此渠能淤地八百四十二亩，浇地一千一百亩。在打井、增修水车方面，各地也制订了具体计划，有的已开始行动起来。冀中行署号召冬季打井修井和增添修理水车后，定县西不落岗六十四户合伙买了十辆水车；束鹿河庄村正在修理旧水车，博野李村群众在工作组推动下，已组织起打新井修旧井各组，及修理水车的四个组，着着进行修复水井工作。
