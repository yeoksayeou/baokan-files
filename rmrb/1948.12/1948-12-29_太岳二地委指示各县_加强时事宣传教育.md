　　Taiyue Second Prefectural Committee Directs Counties
  　Strengthen Current Affairs Propaganda and Education
　　[Taiyue Electricity] The Propaganda Department of the Taiyue Second Prefectural Committee issued instructions to the county committees on the 10th, to strengthen current affairs propaganda and education work among the masses. First, it pointed out that the victorious situation of the People's Liberation War has been developing rapidly recently. All regions should combine various tasks and adopt diverse forms to conduct extensive and in-depth propaganda among the masses in order to encourage the masses' victorious emotions, and thereby accelerate the development of various tasks. Then, it pointed out that since the land reform and party rectification in various places, some places have neglected current affairs propaganda and education work, thus causing some masses to still be considering "who will win and who will lose," which has affected the progress of various tasks. More seriously, the reactionary slogans of the Kuomintang in some villages have not yet been washed away. For example, outside Nanmiao Village in Yicheng, it is still written "Support Commander-in-Chief Chiang to lead the War of Resistance." There are also such slogans in other places, but the propaganda departments in various places have turned a blind eye to this. Therefore, it is required that all places, especially the propaganda departments at all levels, should strengthen their own current affairs study in order to correctly carry out current affairs propaganda at any time and any place in conjunction with their work, and explain the victorious situation to the masses. Secondly, various forms should be adopted for propaganda, such as paying attention to the role of mass blackboards, slogans, etc. From now on, all reactionary and outdated slogans in various places should be washed away and replaced with new slogans. Comrades of various work teams should help and urge the propaganda departments at all levels to check in a timely manner. Use temple fairs and market fairs in various places to publicize various policies and victory news. The propaganda departments at all levels should carry out the transformation of old operas in a step-by-step and planned manner in the future.

　　太岳二地委指示各县
  　加强时事宣传教育
    【太岳电】太岳二地委宣传部于十日指示各县委，加强对群众的时事宣传教育工作。首先指出近来人民解放战争胜利形势飞跃发展，各地应结合各种工作采用多样形式，向群众作广泛的深入宣传，以鼓舞群众的胜利情绪，并由此加速各种工作的开展。接着又指出：各地自土改整党以来，有些地方忽略了时事宣传教育工作，因而使某些群众还在考虑“谁胜谁败”，这就影响了各种工作的进展。更严重的是有些村国民党的反动标语至今尚未洗刷。如翼城南庙村外，还写有“拥护蒋统帅领导抗战”，其他地方也有，但各地宣传部门对此熟视无睹。因此要求各地，首先是各级宣传部门，应加强自己时事学习，才能随时随地结合工作正确的进行时事宣传，给群众说明胜利的形势。其次应采用多种多样方式进行宣传，如注意大众黑板、标语口号等的作用。从现在起，各地应把残留的反动的不合时宜的标语口号，一律洗刷干净，换写新的标语口号。各工作组同志应帮助督促各级宣传部门及时检查。利用各地庙会集市宣传各种政策与胜利消息，各级宣传部门今后要有步骤有计划的进行旧剧改造工作。
