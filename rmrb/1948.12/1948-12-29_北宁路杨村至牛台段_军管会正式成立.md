　　Jizhong Branch Frontline Telegram: After the Yangcun to Niutai section of the Beining Railway was brought under the control of our Northeast People's Liberation Army, the Military Control Commission for this section was formally established on the 20th upon orders. Comrade Liao Dinglin, Deputy Political Commissar of the District Political Department, was appointed as the Director of the Commission, and Comrade Liu Hao, Deputy Commissioner of the Tenth Administrative Office, was appointed as the Deputy Director. They have already begun work. The commission has set up divisions for organization and propaganda, administration, public security, industry and commerce, and traffic police, responsible for protecting railway stations, maintaining social order, and mobilizing the masses to support the front. On the 20th, the Military Control Commission issued a public notice to reassure the people, calling on all sectors to perform their duties with peace of mind. With the help of the Military Control Commission, the two central primary schools in Langfang and the Huangcun Agricultural Vocational School have all resumed classes. The Military Control Commission has also provided the schools with various operating expenses. Railway employees of all sections have also received salaries issued by the Military Control Commission, and the employees are actively inspecting and repairing damages. Personnel of the puppet organizations have registered with the Military Control Commission, and the grain and ammunition depots of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits at each station are being taken over and registered. Our Party's policies on industry and commerce have been publicized, and the people mostly refuse to use "gold yuan coupons" and welcome the local currency. At present, all villages and towns along the line have started work and are carrying out activities to support the front. (Xu Yanzhang)
