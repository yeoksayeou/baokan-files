Xinhua News Agency, East China, 4th: During the twelve-day offensive from the 6th to the 17th of last month by the local armed forces in Central China, incomplete statistics show that they annihilated over 5,000 enemies. From the 8th to the 10th, the Jianghuai Military Region troops, first at Zhaodun Station east of Xuzhou to the Nianzhuangxu line, effectively blocked the westward fleeing bandit Huang Botao's army corps, helping the field army complete the battle plan to compress the enemy's seven divisions into the Nianzhuang area, inflicting significant casualties on the fleeing enemies and capturing over 300 enemy soldiers alive. When the Huaihai local armed forces pursued the enemy salt police brigade and other units fleeing from Xinpu and Haizhou towards Lianyungang, they annihilated over 2,500 enemies, cleared out the remaining bandits in the Xinhai area, and recovered the nationally renowned Zhongzheng and Jinan salt fields (located six to seven li east of Guanyun City). The southern line local armed forces launched offensives in the Gaoyou, Baoying, and Huaian areas, capturing the two important strongholds of Linze and Jinghe on the 8th, annihilating over 1,200 bandits. On the 13th, the local armed forces regiment in central Jiangsu attacked Jiangyan (36 li east of Taizhou), an important town on the Hai’an-Taizhou line, annihilating over 300 enemies, forcing the enemy to hurriedly transfer the 145th and 146th divisions of the 21st Army, which were "mopping up" the north bank of the Yangtze River, and to transfer the 344th Regiment of the 145th Division to defend Rugao. The Tonghai local armed forces, who persisted in defending east of Nantong City, advanced to the Chiang bandits' "encirclement and suppression" zone on the Jiangbian River on the 5th and 9th, raiding the bandit stronghold of Daxingzhen and attacking Tianpuzhen, 12 li west of Haimen City, killing, wounding, and capturing over 110 enemies. On the 16th, the Qintong local armed forces intercepted an enemy speedboat near the Shen＠ stronghold, killing and capturing 27 bandits, including the district chief Zhou Jinggang. They also successively recovered isolated Chiang bandit strongholds such as Shiyan, Zhongbao, and Shen＠ in the Xinghua and Qintong areas. The counties of the Jianghuai Military Region's First Sub-district (formerly the area east of the Huainan Jinpu Railway) annihilated two township public offices in the Yangzhou, Yizheng, and Xuyi areas from the 2nd to the 9th, and raided Qilidian, 7 li west of Yangzhou City, annihilating over 100 local bandits. A unit of the local armed forces of Xiao (County), Su (County), and Tong (Mountain) counties in the Third Sub-district conducted a 90-li long-distance raid on Wangjingzi, 8 li east of Fuliji Station on the Jinpu Railway, on the 7th and 8th of this month. At dawn on the 9th, the armed forces of Si (County), Ling (Bi), and Sui (Ning) counties swept away the local bandits in the Changzhiwan and Yuanjimu areas on the Si (County) Ling (Bi) Highway, killing Wu Xinghan, the first battalion commander of the enemy's Eighth Detachment, and capturing over 20 company commanders and below. On the 11th, a unit of our army in the Second Sub-district ambushed the enemy at Changzhigou west of Lingbi, completely annihilating two security offices of the bandits. Another unit forced the retreat of the Fanjijudian stronghold south of Sixian County City on the evening of the 12th. The local armed forces of the Fourth Sub-district continuously launched sabotage attacks on the Jinpu Railway. On the night of the 7th, the Zhao Fulin explosives team destroyed a section of the Jinpu Railway between Shiji and Xiaoxihe on the Lin (Huaiguan) Ming (Guang) section. Another unit destroyed the iron bridge north of Wudian on the Beng (Bu) Shui (Jiahu) section of the Huainan Road, paralyzing the enemy army.

In total, in the above battles, 3,764 enemies were captured, over 1,500 enemies were killed or wounded, and 107 various cannons, 30 light and heavy machine guns, over 4,000 long and short guns, over 107,000 rounds of ammunition, 9 locomotives, over 200 cars, 12 vehicles, and many other supplies were seized.
