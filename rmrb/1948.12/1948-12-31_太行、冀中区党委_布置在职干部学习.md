　　Taihang and Jizhong District Party Committees
  　Deploy On-the-Job Cadre Study
    [Taihang Electric] The District Party Committee here specially convened an enlarged committee meeting on the 9th of this month to discuss the implementation of the North China Bureau's decision on on-the-job cadre study. First, Comrade Leng Chu, Secretary of the District Party Committee, gave everyone a detailed explanation of the basic spirit and importance of this decision of the North China Bureau. Then, the responsible comrades of the directly affiliated units briefly reported on the learning situation of the机关干部 (jīguān gānbù) [lit. "organ cadres," referring to cadres working in government or party organs] in the second half of this year. Next, they discussed how to implement the North China Bureau's decision next year, and everyone put forward many specific opinions. Finally, Comrade Leng Chu concluded by saying: "This year, especially since the study of the four major documents, the study in various units has generally been successful. Starting next year, all Taihang Party cadres must seriously study theory and read diligently according to the spirit of the North China Bureau's instructions. Those who lack culture must also seriously study culture. The Central Committee has pointed out that the Kuomintang reactionary government can be fundamentally overthrown and a national victory achieved in about a year. If every comrade cannot prepare well now and rapidly improve their theoretical and cultural level, they will not be able to shoulder the glorious task of building a new democratic country in the new situation." In order to ensure the implementation of the North China Bureau's decision, responsible comrades of party committees and departments at all levels must take the lead and take personal action. The directly affiliated organs of the District Party Committee must first play an exemplary role, so as to learn successfully, gain experience, and set an example for the entire district. It is hoped that the comrades present will seriously and responsibly lead the on-the-job cadre study of the entire party next year, requiring regularization and the establishment and improvement of various systems for learning (such as reporting, assessment, reward, and criticism systems). The District Party Committee itself will also establish a system of collective research and discussion, mutual supervision, and inspection. No party member cadre is exempt and no one should show special privilege. As for the costs of books, etc., the method of personal preparation combined with public assistance will be basically adopted, but responsible comrades of each unit must earnestly and responsibly resolve the issue." Based on the above concluding spirit, Comrade Leng Chu further suggested: "A general study committee for the directly affiliated organs of the District Party Committee, Military Region, and Administrative Office should be organized, headed by Comrade Zhao Shizhen, Minister of Propaganda of the District Party Committee, to unify study leadership. The specific plan will be discussed at a meeting convened by the Study Committee. Before the new year, each organ can summarize and inspect the past study to make full preparations for better development of study next year."
    [Jizhong Electric] After discussing the North China Bureau's decision on on-the-job cadre education, the Jizhong District Party Committee, based on the district's past and current situation, issued "Instructions on Strengthening On-the-Job Cadre Education." The instructions pointed out the current shortcomings in learning: "From the perspective of leadership: Party committees at all levels have not truly attached importance to the study of on-the-job cadres and lack strong ideological leadership and specific guidance. From the perspective of learning content: they have not followed the different cultural, political, and theoretical foundations of the cadres, only focusing on the study of specific policies, and relaxing the study of Marxism-Leninism theory and Mao Zedong Thought. From the perspective of the cadres themselves: many cadres, even some higher-level cadres, still lack a conscious spirit of learning. From the perspective of learning methods: for cadres with reading ability, regardless of the object, they have excessively emphasized collective reading, thus limiting the learning enthusiasm and initiative of some cadres." Regarding strengthening on-the-job cadre study in the future, the instructions clearly stipulated: "(1) At the Jizhong level and the sub-district level, each organ should establish a joint study committee under the unified leadership of the party committee. The general committee should be composed of leaders at all levels, with sub-committees, branches, specifically controlling and guiding the study of middle and senior-level cadres. The District Party Committee focuses its guidance on county party committees and regimental level and above. The study of cadres below the middle level and the general staff is the responsibility of the organ branch. (2) Middle and senior-level cadres (county party committee, regimental level and above) should strengthen theoretical study. In terms of learning methods, emphasize self-reading, taking reading notes, and having leading cadres frequently make reports on relevant issues, supplemented by a certain amount of collective discussion. Middle and senior-level cadres are divided into three levels. From January to March next year, it will be the first stage of study. Learning content: generally focusing on a brief history of social development and a concise textbook on social science, with reference to studying social economic forms and the state, etc. Specially organize lectures on the history of social development. In addition, cadres above the middle level should always pay attention to the study of political and current affairs. Party members have the responsibility to mobilize and help non-Party cadres study Marxism-Leninism. (3) Cadres above the district level and general staff in the organs with low cultural levels should strengthen cultural study. Organs above the sub-district level and county organs with the capacity can independently or jointly run relatively formal spare-time cultural tutoring schools equivalent to junior and senior primary schools. (4) Important instructions on the current situation and policies issued by the Central Committee should be studied in a timely manner. The study of various policies related to the central work by the prefecture, county, and municipal party committees should mainly be placed on the work research, inspection, and summary meetings of each period." In order to solve the difficulty for cadres in obtaining study books, each organ above the sub-district level should establish independent or joint libraries, or the organs should uniformly purchase central study documents for a certain period. In addition, it was decided that the Jizhong Guide would publish a learning supplement as a tool for party committees at all levels to guide cadre study. The District Party Committee finally pointed out: "In order to implement the North China Bureau's decision on on-the-job cadre education and the spirit of these instructions, party committees at all levels and all directly affiliated departments in Jizhong should conduct an inspection and summary of the past period of study. And carry out in-depth study mobilization, launching strict criticism against the tendency of not paying attention to leading study and not studying."

　　太行、冀中区党委
  　布置在职干部学习
    【太行电】此间区党委特于本月九日召开扩大委员会议，讨论执行华北局关于在职干部学习的决定。首由区党委书记冷楚同志将华北局这个决定的基本精神和重要性，给大家做了一个详细的解释，继由各直属单位负责同志简单汇报了今年后半年机关干部学习情况，接着讨论对明年如何贯彻执行华北局的决定，大家提出了许多具体意见，最后冷楚同志进行总结称：今年特别是自四大文件学习以来，各单位的学习一般是做得有成绩的，从明年开始，全太行党的干部，都要根据华北局指示的精神认真学习理论，好好读书；缺乏文化的还要认真学习文化。中央已经指出一年左右即可根本上打倒国民党反动政府，取得全国胜利，每个同志现在如不能很好做准备，把自己的理论和文化水平迅速提高一步，是无法在新的形势下担负起新民主主义国家建设的光荣任务的。为了保证华北局决定的贯彻实行，各级党各部门的负责同志，必须以身作则亲自动手，区党委直属各机关，更须首先起模范带头作用，以便学出成绩取得经验示范全区。希望到会的同志要以严肃负责的精神，来认真领导明年全党的在职干部学习，要求做到正规化，要求建立、健全学习方面的各种制度（如报告、考核、奖励和批评等制度）。区党委本身也将建立一种集体研究讨论、互相监督检查的制度，任何党员干部毫无例外，不得表现特殊。至于书籍等费用，基本上采取个人准备与公家帮助的办法，但各单位负责同志一定要认真负责解决。根据上述总结精神，冷楚同志更进一步建议：以区党委宣传部长赵时真同志为首，组织建立区党委、军区、行署一级直属机关的总学习委员会，统一学习领导，具体计划由学委会再行召开会议讨论。年前各机关可将过去的学习作一总结检查，为明年更好的开展学习作充分准备。
    【冀中电】冀中区党委讨论了华北局关于在职干部教育的决定后，根据该区过去和当前情况，发出“关于加强在职干部教育的指示”。指出当前学习上的缺点：从领导上看：各级党委还没有真正重视在职干部的学习，缺乏强有力的思想领导与具体指导。从学习内容上看：也没按照干部现有的不同文化、政治、理论基础，只着重强调了具体政策的学习，放松了马列主义理论与毛泽东思想的学习。从干部本身来看：不少干部，甚至某些较高的干部，还缺乏自觉的学习精神。从学习方法上看：对有阅读能力的干部，不分对象，过分强调了集体阅读，因而限制了某些干部学习积极性与主动性。关于今后加强在职干部的学习，指示中明确规定：（一）冀中级及分区级各机关，要在党委统一领导下，建立联合的学习委员会。总会由各级首长组成，下设分会、支会、专门掌握与指导中、高级干部学习。区党委指导重点放在县委、团级以上。在中级干部以下及一般人员的学习，由机关支部负责领导。（二）中、高级干部（县委、团级以上），一律加强理论学习。在学习方法上，强调自我阅读，做读书笔记，由领导干部经常作有关问题的报告、补充以一定时间的集体讨论。中、高级干部分为三级，从明年一月到三月，作为学习的第一个阶段。学习内容：一般的以社会发展简史、社会科学简明教程为中心，参考学习社会经济形态，论国家等。专门组织社会发展史的讲课。此外，中级以上干部，都应经常注意政治、时事的学习。党员有动员和帮助非常干部学习马列主义的责任。（三）文化水平低的区级以上干部及机关中一般人员，一律加强文化学习。分区以上各机关及有能力的县机关，可单独或联合举办相当于初小、高小的比较正规的业余文化补习学校。（四）对中央发表的有关时局与政策的重要指示，要及时学习。地、县、市委对中心工作有关的各种政策的学习，主要放在每个时期的工作研究、检查、总结等会议上。为了解决干部学习书籍的困难，分区以上各机关，都应建立单独的或联合的图书馆，或机关统一购买一定时期内的中心学习文件，此外，并决定冀中导报出版学习副刊，作为各级党委指导干部学习的工具。区党委最后指出：为了贯彻华北局关于在职干部教育的决定和这一指示的精神，各级党委及冀中各直属部门，应把过去一段学习进行一次检查与总结。并进行深入的学习动员，向不注意领导学习及不学习的倾向，展开严格的批评。
