From the Jizhong Industry and Commerce Department's summary of the spring temple fairs, the restoration of temple fairs in various places has generally played a positive role in developing production, boosting the economy, and exchanging industrial and agricultural products. Temple fairs showed prosperity in terms of economic activity, the number of people and industrial and commercial households, and transaction volume. During the Xinji Temple Fair, a survey of six merchants (workers' cooperatives, whip shops, etc.) showed that the transaction volume more than doubled compared to usual. At the Raoyang Temple Fair, the transaction volume of production and construction materials and necessities for farmers accounted for more than 85%, while non-essentials and consumer goods accounted for more than 14%. The Xinji, Renqiu city, Wurenqiao, and other temple fairs held agricultural and industrial product exhibitions in order to improve the quality of agricultural and industrial products, promote sales, and facilitate industrial and commercial development. Generally, a propaganda section was set up in the temple fair management committee to carry out propaganda activities such as posting slogans and using skits to publicize the news of our front's victory and various policies of our party. Xinji also set up a cultural shed to display cartoons, photos, and old textile artisans, set up a storytelling shed, and printed various small propaganda materials for propaganda activities. From the perspective of the nature of the temple fairs, the feudal rule of the old society over merchants and civilians and old malpractices (such as forced levies, extortion, gambling, etc.) have been abolished, and they have begun to move towards serving production.

However, some shortcomings also exist. For example, in terms of temple fair expenditures, Xinji spent a total of 61,657,30 yuan, most of which was used for opera performances. Shenxian Temple Fair spent a total of 11.21 million yuan, of which 1.07 million yuan was used for opera performances. At some temple fairs, the transaction volume of agricultural and industrial products was not large, and the focus was on having fun and putting on a few operas, with food vendors everywhere. This did not play a role in stimulating production. On the third day of the Renqiu city temple fair, only one plow, three wooden carts, twelve shoulder poles, twenty brooms, and ten pots were sold, while one steamed bun shop sold more than 80,000 yuan, and a horseback riding show earned 70,000 yuan. The Luancheng Temple Fair, besides those selling snacks, had no exchange of agricultural tools at all, only four major operas. The temple management committee had more than 170 people eating at public expense, which was a large expense. This was all due to insufficient prior preparation and a lack of actual transaction content, without focusing on developing production, thinking that having fun was prosperity. In terms of bank loans for temple fairs, they did not focus on lending to agricultural and industrial producers, but favored small vendors selling food. For example, among the 80 households that received loans in Xinji, 45 were tea and rice shops, and 35 were sugar stalls, sundries, second-hand clothing, sesame oil sales, flour mills, and firewood sales. In the city's Seventh Street, 600,000 yuan was loaned, with 400,000 yuan used for restaurants. Some even formed superstitious temple fairs; in Xinle County, many witches performed "pao hua shan" at the fairs, and in Jiucun Temple, witches built more than 80 small temples out of bricks. In Hejiazhuang, Fourth District, they also carried out the construction of a large temple. Some temple fairs even engaged in disguised gambling, and so on.

Now that winter production is underway, temple fairs have a certain role to play in providing various materials, especially for exchanging finished products and regulating production raw materials. In the future, it should be determined: 1. Temple fairs must facilitate transactions and serve mass production. The temple fair management committee can be organized mainly by the Federation of Industry and Commerce and the market committee, and should absorb legitimate merchants and reputable people from the masses to participate, to avoid forming official management. Temple fairs that are purely for entertainment or feudal superstition and have little relationship with mass production should not be restored. 2. It is necessary to overcome the extravagance and waste in temple fairs. The amount of expenses must be voluntary, and no forced levies are allowed. In terms of burden, farmers should not bear it, and general poor small merchants and small producers should not bear it or bear less. Larger industrial and commercial households with more income during the temple fair should bear more of the burden. There should be a precise calculation of income and expenditure in advance. 3. The issue of temple fairs should not be raised near border areas, otherwise, not only will there be no transaction content, but it will also create opportunities for enemy goods to invade and for special agents to operate. 4. Attention should be paid to carrying out propaganda work (such as publishing a journal during the recent Xingtai Temple Fair). Currently, the focus is on publicizing our victory and increasing production knowledge. Where possible and necessary, production exhibitions can be organized to stimulate production and open up sales channels for local products.

### 冀中行署总结春季庙会经验　庙会要为生产服务  应规定具体办法纠正铺张浪费

　　冀中行署总结春季庙会经验
  　庙会要为生产服务
    应规定具体办法纠正铺张浪费
    【本报讯】从冀中工商厅对春季庙会的总结来看，各地恢复庙会一般是起了发展生产、繁荣经济，交换工业品与农业品等积极作用。庙会在经济活动上，人数及工商户数、交易情况上都呈现繁荣景象。辛集庙会期间，据六个商户调查（职工合作社、鞭子铺等），交易额比平日增加一倍多。饶阳庙会，生产建设和农民必需品的交易额占百分之八十五强，非必需品及消费品占百分之十四强。辛集、任邱城内、伍仁桥等庙会，为了提高农工业产品的质量，借以推广销路，便利工商业发展，举行了农工业生产品展览会。一般在庙会管理委员会中设立了宣传股，进行了张贴标语、化装宣传我前方胜利消息及我党各种政策。辛集并设立文化棚，陈列漫画，照片，纺织旧艺人，设立说书棚，印发各种小型宣传品等宣传活动。从庙会性质上来看，废除了旧社会对商民的封建统治，和旧有恶习（如强征、勒索、赌博等），而开始走上为生产服务的道路。
    另外也存在着一些缺点。如在庙会开支方面，辛集共计开支六一六五七三○元，大部用于唱戏。深县庙会开支共一一二一万元，有一○七万元是用于唱戏。有的庙会，农工产品交易数字不大，以是热闹一下，唱几台戏，到处都是卖食品的。没有起了刺激生产作用。任邱城里庙会第三天，工具销售只有一个犁杖，三个木拖床，十二根扁担，廿把扫帚，十口锅，而一户包子铺卖洋八万多元，可是一个跑马戏的也收入七万元。栾城庙会除卖零食者外，根本没有农工具的交换，只有四台大戏。庙管会共一百七十余人吃公饭，开支很大。这都是事先准备不足，而缺乏实际交易内容，没从发展生产着眼，认为热闹一下就是繁荣了。在银行的庙会贷款上，没抓紧贷给农工业生产者，而偏重了卖吃食的小贩。如辛集贷款的八十户中，有茶饭铺四十五户，糖摊，杂食，估衣，卖香油，面坊，卖烧柴等共三十五户。该市第七街贷款六十万元，四十万用于饭铺。更有的形成迷信庙会；新乐县许多巫婆在会上泡花山，九村庙上有巫婆用几个砖砌成小庙八十几座，四区何家庄还进行修大庙。个别庙会上还有的进行变象的赌博等等。
    现在冬季生产正在开展，各种物资特别是交换成品及调剂生产原料，庙会的开展有其一定作用。今后应当确定：一、庙会必需为便利交易，为群众生产服务。可以工商联合会与集市委员会为主，组织庙会管理委员会，吸收正当商人及群众中有威信的人士参加，避免形成官办。如纯系斗热闹或封建迷信、与群众生产没大关系的庙会，一律不恢复。二、必需克服庙会中的铺张浪费现象。费用的多少一定要出于自愿，不准有任何强迫性质。负担方面，不应叫农民负担，一般的贫苦小商及小生产者则应不负担或少负担。在庙会期间收入多的较大的工商业户应多出些负担。事先要有精密的收支计算。三、靠近边沿区不应提出庙会问题，否则不但没交易内容，反而造成敌货内侵与特务活动的机会。四、应注意开展宣传工作（如最近邢台庙会期间出会刊）。目前着重宣传我之胜利和增加生产的知识。在可能和必需条件下，可组织生产展览会，刺激生产，开辟土产销路。
