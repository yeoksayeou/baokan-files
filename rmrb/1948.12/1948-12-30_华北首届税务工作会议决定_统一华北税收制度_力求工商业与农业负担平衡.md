The First North China Tax Work Conference Decides to Unify the Tax System of North China
　　Strive for a Balance Between the Burdens of Industry, Commerce, and Agriculture

　　[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper] The first North China Tax Work Conference opened on November 23rd at the North China People's Government Office Building. The conference lasted ten days, with 54 representatives from various districts (cities) tax bureaus attending. The conference was presided over by Li Yu'ang and Wang Nanqiu, the Director and Deputy Director of the North China Tax Bureau. Wu Bo, the Deputy Minister of Finance of the North China People's Government, attended to provide guidance. The purpose of the conference was to implement the decisions of the North China People's Government's September Financial Conference, establish and improve tax institutions, unify the tax system and the thinking of cadres, solve various policy and tax-related issues, and complete the financial tasks for the 38th year of the Republic (1949).

　　The conference unanimously agreed that our tax policy should start from protecting and developing industry and commerce that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood. At the same time, in order to adapt to the war situation, ensure the supply of military needs, and take into account the burden-bearing capacity of farmers, we should strive to gradually achieve a reasonable balance between the burdens of industry, commerce, and agriculture. We should oppose the purely tax-collecting, policy-ignoring financial views of some people. The agricultural tax of 25 catties per mu this year is undeniably a very heavy burden. Therefore, the North China Financial Conference decided to reorganize taxation, open up new tax sources, and stipulate that various industrial and commercial taxes should account for one-sixth of the total revenue in the 38th year of the Republic. Everyone agreed that this should have been done earlier. In order to complete this new tax task, tax workers must abide by the unified policies, regulations, and rules of the entire region and are not allowed to establish their own systems or formulate their own rules. The various draft tax regulations proposed at the September Financial Conference are still under review by the North China People's Government. In order not to affect fiscal revenue and to enable lower levels to work in a unified manner, the conference decided to provisionally implement them in three categories: (1) Industrial and commercial income tax, small business license tax, temporary business tax, transaction tax, import and export tax, tobacco tax, alcohol tax, and salt tax have been levied in the past, and now it is only a matter of modifying the tax rates and tax categories. It was decided to try levying them according to the draft. Among them, the part of the industrial and commercial income tax concerning the taxation of joint-stock companies needs to be further studied and will not be implemented for the time being. (2) Slaughter tax and rural industrial and commercial tax will also be tried out throughout the region. Salary and wage income tax has been widely implemented in the former Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan area in the autumn of the 37th year of the Republic (1948); it should be promoted throughout the region in the 38th year of the Republic. (3) Commodity tax, stamp tax, mining tax, urban real estate tax, and temporary business tax are all new taxes from the perspective of the liberated areas. For the sake of prudence, each district (city) should submit plans based on the taxable types and taxable areas, and submit them to the General Bureau for submission to the North China People's Government for approval before trial implementation.

　　Among the above-mentioned taxes, the conference believed that industrial and commercial income tax is important and the situation is complex. From January to March of the 38th year of the Republic, the collection of this tax must be taken as the central task. The collection method should be changed to annual (lunar calendar) assessment and monthly collection, and the conclusion of the 37th year of the Republic's collection and the commencement of the 38th year of the Republic's collection should be arranged in one go. The North China People's Government has decided that all state-owned enterprises will uniformly pay income tax at 15% of their net income this year (organ production is taxed as general industry and commerce). The conference decided on the following specific collection methods: (1) State-owned enterprises will be summarized by the leading units of the department and submitted to the General Bureau; (2) District (city)營 enterprises will be summarized by the leading units of the department and submitted to the District (city) Bureau; (3) Taxes other than industrial and commercial income tax (such as commodity tax) will be collected locally.

　　Secondly, salary and wage income tax is a kind of income tax and should be levied. Especially in the current situation in North China, in order to adjust war service, balance the burdens of workers, merchants, and farmers, this tax should be promoted even more. Farmers bear both agricultural tax and war service. If urban workers and merchants neither pay salary and wage income tax nor bear war service, it is very unreasonable. Therefore, the former Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan area once proposed to levy salary and wage income tax, while some areas in the former Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei area levied war service fees. In order to establish a normal tax system, in the 38th year of the Republic, the two regions should uniformly levy salary and wage income tax. In addition, levying rural industrial and commercial income tax is also one of the ways to adjust the agricultural burden.

　　The conference also discussed in detail various procedural laws, such as: Interim Measures for the Reduction, Exemption, Refund, and Special Permission for Arrears of Taxes by North China Tax Authorities, Regulations of the North China Tax Bureau on Handling Violations, Measures for the Distribution of Anti-Smuggling Bonuses, Measures for the Rewards and Punishments of Tax Workers, Inspection Rules, Measures for the Handling of Confiscated Goods, Accounting Procedures, and Interim Measures for the Management of Tax Receipts, a total of eleven draft documents. It was decided to implement them on a trial basis in accordance with the instructions of the higher authorities. The representatives will go back to expedite the clearing and closing of the tax payments, tax tickets, confiscated items, and unfinished accounts for the 37th year of the Republic, in order to facilitate the work for the 38th year of the Republic.

　　The conference had a heated discussion on the management policy of the monopoly alcohol. In order to solve the financial needs during the war and save grain raw materials, the following guidelines were determined: (1) Reduce production and sales and increase tax rates; (2) Implement economic accounting and strive to reduce costs; (3) Strengthen the leadership of business management and technology integration; (4) In the future, use more non-grain raw materials for brewing, increase fruit wine, wine, yam wine, and reduce grain wine; (5) Focus on trial machine brewing to increase profits. The conference also discussed the funding standards for distilleries and the standards for the use of raw materials. In the past, some distilleries occupied a lot of funds and had a very slow turnover. The highest amount of funds required for each catty of wine was two catties of rice; in terms of brewing, raw materials were also quite wasteful. The highest amount of raw materials required for each catty of wine was three catties to three catties and six taels. Based on the experience of various places, it was determined that the funds for each catty of wine should be ten taels to one catty of rice, and the raw materials for each catty of wine should not exceed two catties and twelve taels. Other unanimous opinions were also obtained, such as centralized management of distilleries, changing small stills to large stills, abolishing management offices, and reducing leadership levels, in order to streamline personnel and reduce costs. As a result, the profit per catty of wine in the 38th year of the Republic can be increased by one catty to one and a half catties of rice, which can increase the financial revenue by more than 30 million catties for the whole year. This is a great progress.

　　Regarding organizational structure and cadre issues, the conference believed that all regions should quickly seek to improve institutions and enrich cadres. It also believed that in order to adapt to the needs of the development of the war situation, it is necessary to train a large number of tax cadres and improve the business skills of incumbent cadres. The General Bureau has entrusted the University of Finance and Economics to establish a taxation department, recruit students, transfer incumbent cadres for rotational training, cultivate specialized tax talents, and create a bi-monthly publication "Tax Work Research" for work guidance and for incumbent cadres to study business reference.

　　At the closing of the conference, Deputy Minister Wu spoke, first pointing out that according to the development of the war situation, the entire territory of North China will soon be liberated, and there will be great development in production. On this basis, the tax tasks for the 38th year of the Republic can not only be completed but also have the potential to greatly exceed them. I hope everyone will work hard to complete the task. Secondly, he criticized some views that belittle tax work, explaining that tax work is also a glorious and important revolutionary work position. He also called on everyone to cultivate a new style of work, study policies, publicize policies, and implement tasks. Finally, he talked about the issue of unification and concentration. He repeatedly clarified that this is the key to our victory in the country. The phenomenon of each doing its own thing and mutually excluding each other in the past tax work must be corrected. In the future, all levels must implement a system of requesting instructions and reporting, so that we can make fewer mistakes in our work. (Zeng Wenjing)

　　华北首届税务工作会议决定
  　统一华北税收制度
    力求工商业与农业负担平衡
    【本报特讯】华北首届税务工作会议，于十一月二十三日在华北人民政府办公厅开幕，历时十天，到会有各区（市）税务局代表五十四人。由华北税务总局正副局长李予昂，王南秋二同志主持。华北人民政府财政部副部长吴波同志出席指导。会议目的是贯彻华北人民政府九月财政会议的决定，建立与健全税务机构，统一税收制度与干部思想，解决有关税收的各种政策与各种问题，完成三十八年度的财政任务。
    会议一致认为：我们的税收政策应以保护发展有利于国计民生的工商业为出发点，同时，为了适应战争形势，保证军需供给并照顾农民的负担力，应力求工商业与农业负担逐渐趋于合理平衡。应该反对某些人的单纯收税不讲求政策的财政观点。今年农业税每负担亩征二十五斤，不能不说是很重的负担，因此，华北财政会议决定整理税收，开辟新税源，规定三十八年度工商业各项税收应占岁入总额的六分之一。大家都认为早应如此办。为了完成这一新的税收任务，税务工作者必须遵照全区统一的政策、条例、规章制度办事，不准自立制度自定规章。九月财政会议提出的各种税收条例草案，华北人民政府尚在审查中。为了不影响财政收入，并使下级能以统一步调、进行工作，这次会议决定暂分三类执行：（一）工商业所得税，小商牌照税，临时营业税，交易税，出入口税，烟税，酒税，盐税，过去已经征收过，现在只是税率、税种修改的问题，决定先按草案试征。其中，工商业所得税中关于股份公司征税部分，尚须继续研究，暂不实行。（二）屠宰税、农村工商业税，亦在全区试征。薪给工资所得税三十七年秋季已在原晋冀鲁豫区普遍试行；三十八年度当推行全区。（三）货物税，印花税，矿业税，城市房地产税，临时营业税，从解放区说来，均为新税，为慎重起见，应由各区（市）根据可征种类与可征地区，提出计划，送总局转呈华北人民政府核准后再行试办。
    在以上各种税收中，会议认为工商业所得税关系重要，情况复杂，三十八年一月至三月，须将征收此税作为中心工作。征收方法，改为年初（旧历）评定，按月征收，并将结束三十七年度的征收与三十八年度的开征，合并一次布置。华北人民政府已决定公营企业今年一律按纯收益百分之十五征收所得税，（机关生产按一般工商业征税）。会议决定具体征收办法如下：（一）国营企业由该部门领导单位汇总交总局；（二）区（市）营企业由该部门领导单位汇总交区（市）局；（三）工商业所得税以外应纳之税（如货物税）均就地征收。
    其次，薪给工资所得税是所得税的一种，应当征收。尤其就华北区目前情况来说，为了调剂战勤，平衡工人商人与农民的负担，更应推行此税。农民既负担农业税，又负担战勤，如果城市工人、商人既不纳薪给工资所得税，又不负担战勤，那是很不合理的。因此，原晋冀鲁豫区曾提出征收薪给工资所得税，原晋察冀区部分地区则征战勤费。为了建立正常税制，三十八年度，两区应统一征收薪给工资所得税。此外，征收农村工商业所得税亦是调剂农业负担办法之一。
    会议关于各种手续法，如：华北税务机关对税款的减免，补退及特许欠款暂行办法，华北税务总局关于处理违章案件的规定，缉私奖金的分配办法，税务工作人员奖惩办法，稽查规则，没收品处理办法，会计规程及税收票证管理暂行办法等共十一种草案亦曾详加研讨。决定遵照上级指示试行。三十七年度的税款，税票没收品及未了帐项，由各代表回去尽速清理结束，以利三十八年度工作进行。
    会议对于专营酒的经营方针，作了热烈讨论，为了解决战时财政需要与节约粮食原料，确定了如下方针；（一）少产少销提高税率；（二）实行经济核算，力求降低成本；（三）加强经营管理与技术相结合的领导；（四）今后多用非粮食原料酿制，增加果木酒，葡萄酒，山药酒，减少粮食酒；（五）重点试行机器酿造，增加利润。会议并讨论了烧锅资金标准，与使用原料标准。过去有些烧锅占资金很多，周转很慢，最高的每斤酒需资金米二斤；酿造方面，原料亦颇浪费，最高的每斤酒需原料三斤至三斤六两。此次根据各地经验，确定了每斤酒的资金米十两至一斤，每斤酒的原料不超过二斤十二两。基他如集中经营烧锅，改小甑为大甑，裁撤经营处，减少领导层次，以期精简人员，降低成本，亦获得一致意见。由此使三十八年度每斤酒的利润可提高一斤到斤半米，全年即可增加三千余万斤的财政收入。这是一个很大的进步。
    关于组织机构及干部问题，会议认为各地区应迅求健全机构，充实干部。并认为为了适应战争形势发展的需要，必须培养大批税务干部与提高在职干部的业务技能，现总局已委托财经学院设立税务系，招考学生，抽调在职干部轮训，培养专门税务人材，并创办“税工研究”半月刊，以作工作指导和在职干部研究业务参考之用。
    会议闭幕时，吴副部长讲话，首先指出，根据战争形势的发展，华北全境即将解放，生产必有大的发展。在这个基础上，三十八年度的税收任务不但能够完成且有可能争取大大超过。希望大家努力工作，完成任务。其次，他批评了某些轻视税务工作的观点，说明税务工作也是一个光荣的与重要的革命工作岗位。他并号召大家培养新作风，学习政策，宣传政策，执行任务。最后谈到统一集中问题，他反复阐明这是我们争取全国胜利的关键。税收工作过去存在着的各自为政，互相排挤现象，必须纠正。今后各级必须实行请示报告制度，这样才能使我们在工作中少犯错误。（曾文经）
