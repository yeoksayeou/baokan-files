The North China Government Education Department Instructs All Localities to Carry Out Cultural and Recreational Propaganda
    Use Victory to Inspire the Masses' Enthusiasm for Production and Supporting the Front

[Reported by this newspaper] The Spring Festival is approaching. In order to strengthen mass cultural and recreational activities in various regions, the Education Department of the North China Government recently issued instructions stating: "The purpose of carrying out cultural and recreational activities during the upcoming Spring Festival is to inspire the masses' victorious emotions, strengthen people's unity, enhance production enthusiasm, and encourage the initiative in supporting the front. Furthermore, based on past cultural and recreational activities, it is intended to further promote the mass art movement. Especially in the victorious situation of defeating Chiang Kai-shek in about a year, it is very important to use mass cultural and recreational activities to deepen the effect of propaganda and education. To achieve this goal:

(1) First of all, it is required to strengthen leadership. Generally, in the first ten days of the twelfth lunar month, leaders of village theater troupes and various new and old artists should be drawn as much as possible for training, or cultural and recreational work symposiums should be held to clarify the direction, exchange experiences, introduce some new scripts and operas, and organize good theater troupes, Yangge teams, or other cultural and recreational organizations to conduct typical demonstrations. Before the end of the Spring Festival cultural and recreational activities, cultural and recreational competitions should be held within a certain range where conditions permit, to reward models and establish the correct direction. Education departments at all levels of government and comrades participating in central work in the countryside have the responsibility to help do a good job in mass cultural and recreational work, and should not ignore it on the pretext of being busy or "not understanding." During the Spring Festival, cultural troupes at all levels and local professional theater companies should vigorously help and promote cultural and recreational work in certain areas. Amateur theater troupes of various agencies, organizations, and schools should be combined with local mass cultural and recreational movements. The development of cultural and recreational work must be based on the needs and willingness of the masses, and oppose coercion and disguised coercion. The leadership of the village theater troupe should be attended by village cadres supported by the masses to strengthen the education of the members and oppose improper work styles.

(2) Requirements for different regions: 1. In areas with a good foundation in mass art, village theater troupes and Yangge teams should be restored and consolidated, and used as the core to unite and transform all folk artists (such as storytelling, writing ballads, playing music, painting murals, etc.), give full play to their creative genius, and utilize all folk entertainment forms (such as stilt walking, shadow plays, overlord whips, small flower operas, etc.) to enrich new content, encourage the creation of new forms that are popular, lively, and joyful among the masses, and create a mass cultural and recreational movement. 2. In areas without a foundation in the past, various small-scale cultural and recreational activities can be carried out according to local conditions. In terms of form, regardless of new or old, large or small, it is sufficient to reflect new content, but at the same time, it is necessary to focus on helping organize and cultivate some village theater troupes, summarize experiences in a timely manner, so that they can influence and promote cultural and recreational activities elsewhere. 3. In larger cities, grand celebrations of the victory of liberation parades and recreational competitions, lantern festivals, etc. should be held under necessary and possible conditions to strengthen the publicity of current affairs and policies.

(3) The important key to carrying out cultural and recreational work lies in creating more new scripts and operas, which requires the cooperation of the masses, intellectuals, and old artists in various regions. The content of creation mainly focuses on unity and production, democratic construction, current affairs propaganda, and support for the front, followed by literacy and cultural learning, hygiene, and anti-superstition. The method of creation should follow the mass line, and the review of works is a very heavy task. Relying solely on the review of cadres from counties (cities) and districts cannot solve all problems. It must be combined with the method of mass review to be more effective.

(4) It is impossible to solve the problem by banning the performance of all kinds of old operas. However, it is also wrong to promote the performance of old operas without principle, so that the development of new operas is affected. We must follow the spirit of the People's Daily commentary in November, "Carry out the reform of old operas in a planned and step-by-step manner," and refer to the "List of Operas Currently Allowed and Prohibited from Performance" (the first collection will be announced separately) issued by the Ministry of Education, and appropriately restrict the performance of old operas. If other operas are found outside the above list that are considered to be within the scope of advocating slave morality, advocating national disgrace, advocating feudal oppression, or advocating superstitious and obscene ideas, they may be temporarily ordered to stop performing, and the script or detailed description should be sent to the North China Drama and Music Work Committee for review. If temporary old opera troupes are established during the Spring Festival, they must be approved by the county (city) government, and their repertoire must be reviewed before they can perform. We should try our best to persuade the masses to perform more new operas and less old operas; in particular, we must overcome the phenomenon that individual cadres encourage the performance of some harmful old operas out of their own preferences, regardless of the impact on the masses.

(5) Mass cultural and recreational activities should be simple and unadorned, avoid extravagance and waste, and be sure to pay attention to spending less money and be resolved by the masses through public discussion as a principle.

(6) Village theater troupes should not record work points or be exempted from attendance for rehearsing or performing plays or other activities. In order to take care of the masses' ideological education and cultural and recreational life, the time, method, etc. of the village theater troupe members' burden of war service can be appropriately adjusted during the Spring Festival so as not to excessively hinder the performance work.

    华北政府教育部指示各地
    春节开展文娱宣传
    用胜利鼓舞群众生产支前热情
    【本报讯】春节即将到来，为加强各地群众文娱活动，华北政府教育部顷发出指示称：“开展明年春节文娱活动的目的：在于鼓舞群众胜利情绪，加强人民团结，提高生产热情，鼓励支前的积极性；并在以往文娱活动的基础上，把群众艺术运动向前推进一步。特别是在一年左右打垮蒋介石的胜利形势下，用群众性的文娱活动来加深宣传教育的效果，是非常重要的。为达到这一目的：
    （一）首先要求加强领导，一般在旧历腊月上旬，尽可能抽调村剧团的负责人及各种新旧艺人，进行训练，或开文娱工作座谈会，明确方针，交流经验，介绍一些新的剧本和唱本，并组织好的剧团，秧歌队或其他文娱组织，进行典型示范，在春节文娱活动结束前，有条件的举行一定范围的文娱竞赛，奖励模范，树立正确方向。各级政府教育部门，及下乡参加中心工作的同志，都有责任帮助作好群众文娱工作，不要借口工作忙或“不懂”，而置之不理。在春节期间，各级文工团，各地专业剧社，要大力帮助和推动一定地区的文娱工作。各机关、团体、学校的业余剧团，要与当地群众文娱运动相结合。开展文娱工作必须根据群众的需要和自愿，反对强迫和变相强迫的现象，村剧团的领导，要有为群众所拥护的村干参加，加强团员教育，反对不正派的作风。
    （二）对不同地区的要求：一、在群众艺术基础较好的地区，应恢复整顿村剧团及秧歌队，并以此为核心，团结与改造一切民间艺人（如说鼓书、编板话、闹音乐、画壁画……等），充分发挥他们的创作天才；利用一切民间娱乐形式（如踩高跷、拉洋片、霸王鞭、小花戏……等），充实新的内容，鼓励创造群众喜见乐闻，活泼愉快的新形式，造成群众性的文娱运动。二、过去没有基础的地区，可根据本地条件开展多种多样的小型文娱活动，在形式上不论新旧大小，能反映新的内容即可，但同时要有重点的帮助组织与培养一些村剧团，及时总结经验，使能影响与推动别处的文娱活动。三、较大城市里，在必需与可能的条件下，举行盛大的庆祝解放的胜利游行，和游艺比赛，提灯会……等，加强时事和政策的宣传。
    （三）开展文娱工作的重要关键，在于更多的创作新剧本和新唱本，这就需要各地群众和知识分子及旧艺人的合作。创作内容，主要为团结生产，民主建政及时事宣传和支援前线，其次为识字学文化、卫生、反迷信等内容，创作的方法应走群众路线，审查作品，是一非常繁重的工作，只靠县（市）区干部的审查，不能解决全部问题，必须和群众审查的方法结合起来，才更有效。
    （四）对各种旧剧，一律禁演是不能解决问题的，但无原则的助长旧剧演出的风气，以致使新剧的发展受到影响，也是错误的。我们要根据十一月人民日报专论“有计划有步骤地进行旧剧改革工作”的精神，并参照教育部发布的“现时准演及禁演的剧目表”（第一集即将另文公布），对旧剧演出加以适当限制，各地在上述剧目表外，发现其他剧目认为系属于提倡奴隶道德，提倡民族失节，提倡封建压迫，提倡迷信与淫乱思想的范围，可暂令其停演，将剧本或详细说明送华北戏剧音乐工作委员会审查。如有在春节中成立临时旧剧班的，必须经过县（市）政府的批准，并将其剧目审查后，才能出演。我们要尽量说服群众多演新剧，少演旧剧；尤其要克服个别干部因自己的爱好，鼓励一些有害的旧剧演出，不顾及群众影响的现象。
    （五）群众文娱活动，力求简便朴素，切忌铺张浪费，务必注意少花钱，并由群众公议自己解决为原则。
    （六）村剧团排戏演戏或作其他活动，均不应记工或免勤，为了照顾群众的思想教育与文娱生活，对村剧团团员负担战勤的时间、方式等，可在春节期间适当调剂，不使过于妨碍演出工作。            （厅叶）
