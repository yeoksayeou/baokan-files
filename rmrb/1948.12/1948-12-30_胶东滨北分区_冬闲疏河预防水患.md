Xinhua News Agency, East China, 24th -- In order to prevent floods next year, the Binbei Sub-region of Jiaodong District, Shandong Province, is using the winter slack season to dredge rivers. The river dredging projects in Gaomi and Cangma (newly established county, located in the eastern part of Ju County) counties in the district began last month. Gaomi plans to dredge rivers with a total length of 60 li, and has now completed the upper section of the Zhugong River, which is 11 li long and 4.2 zhang wide. The dredging project of Henghe, one of the four major rivers in Cangma, was two-thirds completed within eight days. Zhucheng has surveyed eight new ditches, totaling 87 li in length. Jubei County (Ju County) plans to complete two-thirds of the river dredging project this winter. Jiaonan, Chou Lian (newly established county, southwest of Zhucheng) and other counties are sending cadres to the counties where work has already started to learn, so that they can return to their counties next spring to lead the start of work. Rivers are spread throughout the Binbei Sub-region, and there have been floods every year. Although the people of the district dug rivers this spring to prevent floods, floods still occurred this autumn because some tributaries were not dredged. Therefore, the Binbei CCP District Committee and the Commissioner's Office decided to continue to lead the people in dredging rivers for flood prevention during the winter and spring slack seasons.

　　胶东滨北分区
  　冬闲疏河预防水患
    【新华社华东二十四日电】为了预防明年水患，山东胶东区滨北分区利用冬闲疏浚河流。该区高密、藏马（新设县，位莒县东部）两县疏河工程已于上月先后开工。高密准备疏浚全长六十里的河流，现已完成十一里长四丈二尺宽的朱公河上游一段。藏马四大河流之一的横河，其疏浚工程八天内即已完成三分之二。诸城已测量八条新沟，计长八十七里。莒（县）北县计划今冬完成疏河工程的三分之二。胶（县）南、丑莲（新设县，诸城西南）等县则调集干部到已开工各县见习，以便明春回县领导开工。滨北分区境内河流遍布，历年均有水患。今春该区人民虽曾挖河预防，但因若干支流未经疏浚，以致今秋仍发生水灾。因此滨北中共地委及专署决定在今冬明春农闲季节继续领导人民疏河防灾。
