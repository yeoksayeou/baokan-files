Xinhua News Agency, East China, 27th: People in counties such as Leling, Nanpi, and Wuqiao in Shandong Province are vigorously helping the families of newly enlisted soldiers with production. In Zhaojia Village, Leling, young and strong laborers organized themselves and plowed all 50 mu of land that should be cultivated by military dependents in the village in one day. The children's corps helped military dependents dig up more than 20 mu of peanuts. The women's director of Citou Village in the county led more than 100 members to help 17 military dependents and government workers' families dig up 97 mu of peanuts in two days. Members of the Farmers' Association mobilized 60 strong laborers and used more than 20 plows to plow all the land that should be cultivated by the families of 15 soldiers and martyrs in three days. The Communist Party branch of Xin Village, Wuqiao Village held a meeting of cadres above the level of group leader, studied the difficulties in the production of 17 military dependents in the village household by household, and mobilized farmers to help six military dependents without labor and livestock to cultivate the land. After the new soldiers of Liu Wenzhuangzi in Dianzi District, Nanpi, set off, all the village cadres divided their work to visit 46 military, martyr and worker families to express their sympathy, and immediately helped to solve the difficulties they discovered. For example, Zhang Shi's family, a new military dependent, lacked labor, and had more than one mu of land that had not been cultivated, and no one to carry water. Yue Julin, the village head, mobilized three farmers, Zhou Bingxiang and others, to be responsible for cultivating the land for him, and An Xiaoli, a semi-laborer, to carry water for him. In addition to educating farmers on preferential treatment for military dependents, the Communist Party branch of Luo Zhangjia Village in the district re-studied the substitute farming organization and determined three major principles: (1) If the military dependents cannot cultivate the land by themselves, they should report it publicly for discussion and let others cultivate and plant it for them; (2) Democratic discussion and free combination to organize substitute farming groups (the original cooperative farming groups organized with military dependents should not be dismantled); (3) Those with full labor power should help military dependents cultivate the land, and those with semi-labor power should help with odd jobs such as carrying water and mudding houses.

　　山东各地人民
  　大力帮助军属生产
    【新华社华东二十七日电】山东乐陵、南皮、吴桥等县人民，大力帮助新出征战士家属进行生产。乐陵赵家村青壮年组织起来，一天内，将该村军属应耕之五十亩地全部耕完，儿童团帮助军属刨花生二十多亩。该县茨头村妇女主任带领百余会员，两天内帮助十七家军属与政府工作人员家属刨花生九十七亩。农会会员动员六十名壮年，套二十多张犁，三天内，把十五家军人、烈士家属应耕的土地全部耕完。吴桥村宅区辛庄共产党支部召开小组长以上干部会，挨户研究该村十七户军属生产中的困难问题，并动员农民帮助六家没劳力及畜力的军属耕地。南皮店子区刘文庄子于新战士出发后，全村干部即分工到四十六家军烈工属挨家挨户慰问，发现困难马上帮助解决。如新军属张世家因缺乏劳力，有一亩多地没有耕上，水也没人挑，该村闾长岳聚林即动员农民周丙祥等三人负责给他耕地，半劳力的安效礼给他挑水。该区罗张家村共产党支部除对农民进行优待军属教育外，并重新研究代耕组织，确定三大原则：（一）军属自己耕种不过来的地，自报公议出来由别人代耕代种；（二）民主讨论自由结合组织代耕组（原和军属组织的搭犋组不拆散）；（三）整劳力者帮助军属耕种土地，半劳力者帮做零活如挑水、泥房等。
