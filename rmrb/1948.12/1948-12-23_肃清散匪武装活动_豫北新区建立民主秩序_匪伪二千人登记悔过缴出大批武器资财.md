[Taihang Electric] The vast new district of northern Henan, through the concerted efforts of our Party, government, army, and people, has rapidly cleared out scattered bandits and established a democratic order. In this work, each newly recovered area has used militia armed forces as the backbone, combined with the broad masses of farmers, extensively publicized to enemy personnel, and correctly implemented our Party's various policies to eliminate the enemy's remaining armed forces. In Weihui City, Xiuwu, Wuzhi, and Jiaozuo, a total of 1,990 enemy officers, soldiers, and personnel have registered with the government to repent and surrender, and handed over a large quantity of weapons and military supplies. In Weihui, Jiaozuo, Huojia, Wuzhi, and Xiuwu five cities and counties alone, the following were seized: one 60mm mortar, one small artillery piece, eighteen machine guns, more than 1,480 rifles and pistols, 420 artillery shells, 17,800 rounds of ammunition plus eleven boxes, four cars, one radio transmitter, twelve telephones, and one radio receiver. The main reasons for achieving the above results are: (1) Correctly implement the Party's policies, widely publicize the victorious situation, point out a way out, and strive for enemy personnel to voluntarily surrender and disarm. Under the call for meritorious service to atone for sins, the registered enemy personnel have also persuaded unregistered enemy personnel to repent, or reported hidden enemy weapons, etc. Individual stubborn elements who continue to carry out sabotage activities, such as hidden Chiang bandits and principal culprits, will be arrested and punished according to law. (2) Mobilize the masses to eliminate the remaining armed forces of the enemy and puppets, denounce the crimes of the Chiang bandits, and report the enemy and puppets' hidden weapons, resources, and hidden saboteurs. The key is to enlighten the masses and give them support and encouragement, breaking their fears of "retaliation." Many lower-level enemy family members, relatives, friends, and neighbors have actively participated in this work because they have eliminated their concerns. (3) Promote a thorough and meticulous working style. Not only should we hold large-scale meetings to issue calls or carry out general publicity and mobilization, but also conduct patient individual investigations and visits.

　　肃清散匪武装活动
    豫北新区建立民主秩序
    匪伪二千人登记悔过缴出大批武器资财
    【太行电】豫北广大新区，经我党政军民协同一致迅速肃清散匪，建立了民主秩序。各新收复区在这一工作中，均以民兵武装为骨干，与广大农民结合起来，对敌方人员广泛宣传，并正确执行我党各种政策，肃清敌残余武装。卫辉市、修武、武陟、焦作先后已有敌军官兵人员一千九百九十余人向政府登记悔过，并缴出大批武器与军用物资。仅卫辉、焦作、获嘉、武陟、修武五市县，即收缴六零炮一门、小炮一门、机枪十八挺，长短枪一千四百八十余支，炮弹四百二十发，子弹一万七千八百发又十一箱，汽车四辆，电台一部，电话机十二部，收音机一架。取得如上成绩的主要原因是：（一）正确贯彻执行党的政策，广泛宣传胜利形势，指明出路，争取敌军人员自行投案与缴械。在立功赎罪的号召下，已登记的敌军人员并劝说未登记之敌军人员去悔过，或报告敌人隐藏之武器等。对个别执迷不悟，仍继续进行破坏活动的暗藏蒋匪与首恶分子，则依法逮捕惩处。（二）发动群众肃清敌伪残余武装，控诉蒋匪罪行，报告敌伪隐藏之武器资财与暗藏的破坏分子。关键是启发群众觉悟，并给以撑腰鼓励，打破其怕“报复”的思想顾虑，不少下层敌军家属亲朋邻居，因扫除了顾虑，亦积极参加这一工作。（三）发扬了深入细致的工作作风。不光开大会发号召或进行一般的宣传动员，而且要进行耐心的个别调查访问等工作。
