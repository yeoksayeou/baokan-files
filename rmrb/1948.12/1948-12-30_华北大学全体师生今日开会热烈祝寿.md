[Reported by this newspaper] The entire faculty and students of Hua University will hold a meeting today to warmly celebrate the 70th birthday of Comrade Wu Yuzhang, a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and President of Hua University.
    [This Newspaper] Just as the People's Liberation Army is reporting successive victories, and Tianjin and Beijing are about to be captured, and all of North China is about to be liberated, we are pleased to celebrate the 70th birthday of Comrade Wu Yuzhang, a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and President of Hua University, on December 30. All faculty and students of the university are celebrating the birthday of this veteran revolutionary with extreme excitement and joy. A birthday celebration preparatory committee has been formed, which will compile and print "Chronicle of Comrade Wu Yuzhang" and "Revolutionary Stories of Comrade Wu Yuzhang". A grand and enthusiastic celebration meeting will be held today. Comrade Wu Yuzhang has participated in all the revolutionary movements in China for the past 40 years, and has always stood at the forefront, fighting most resolutely. When he went to study in Japan at the age of 25, he was the most radical revolutionary at the time and organized the Revolutionary Alliance with Mr. Sun Yat-sen. Before and after the Revolution of 1911, he participated in the Huanghuagang Uprising, and later returned to Sichuan to organize the Rongxian Independence and Neijiang Uprising. After the October Revolution and the May Fourth Movement, he became one of the earliest communists in China and immediately joined the Communist Party of China. During the Great Revolution, he resolutely fought against the right-wing of the Kuomintang and its dictatorial head Chiang Kai-shek, who conspired to usurp the party and seize power, and became one of the most active and vigorous revolutionaries at the time. After the failure of the Great Revolution, he participated in the Nanchang Uprising. Before and during the Anti-Japanese War, he actively carried out international propaganda and assumed the work of the Anti-Japanese National United Front. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, he served as a representative of our party to participate in the Political Consultative Conference. After the Kuomintang reactionaries launched the civil war, in March 1946, when the personnel of the Chinese Communist Party stationed in Chongqing were forced to withdraw, he waged a resolute struggle against the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, forcing the bandits to submit and safely withdraw to Yan'an. Since he took office as President of Hua University in August this year, his tireless work and his loyalty and enthusiasm for the revolution have deeply inspired and educated all faculty and students.

　　华北大学全体师生今日开会热烈祝寿
    【本报讯】正当人民解放军捷报频传，平津指日可下，全华北就要解放的时候，欣逢十二月三十日为中共中央委员华北大学校长吴玉章同志七十大寿，该校全体教职学员都在以极兴奋极喜悦的心情来祝贺这位革命老人的诞辰，并已组成祝寿筹备会，除编印“吴玉章同志年谱”、“吴玉章同志革命故事”外，并将于今日举行隆重而热烈的庆祝会。吴玉章同志四十年来参加了中国历次的革命运动，而且总是站在最前线，战斗得最坚决。二十五岁到日本留学，即为当时最激进的革命派，和孙中山先生一起组织了革命同盟会。辛亥革命前后，参加了黄花岗起义，后来又回四川组织了荣县独立、内江起义。十月革命和五四运动以后，又成为中国很早的共产主义者之一，并随即参加了中国共产党。大革命时候，曾坚决地和国民党右派及其阴谋篡党篡政的独裁头子蒋介石斗争，成为当时最活跃最有魄力的革命家之一。大革命失败后，参加了南昌起义。抗日战争前后，积极做国际宣传，并担负起抗日民族统一战线的工作。抗战胜利，又任我党代表参加政治协商会议。国民党反动派发动内战后，于一九四六年三月中共驻渝人员被迫撤离时候，和蒋介石匪帮又作了坚决的斗争，使匪徒屈服，安全撤回延安。今年八月，任华大校长以来，不知疲倦的工作以及对革命的忠诚与热情，使全校教职学员都受到深刻的感召和教育。
