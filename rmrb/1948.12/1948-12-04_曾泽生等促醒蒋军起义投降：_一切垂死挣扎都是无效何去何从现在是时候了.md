Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 30th -- General Zeng Zesheng and others, who revolted in Changchun, recently published a letter to officers and soldiers of the Kuomintang army, hoping that the Kuomintang army would quickly awaken and stop working for the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries. The original letter is as follows: To all officers and soldiers of the National Kuomintang Army:

　　After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, Chiang Kai-shek, using his consistent conspiracies, on the one hand, used accepting the surrender as an excuse to transfer our entire army to distant Hanoi; on the other hand, he created the Kunming Incident, using the people of Yunnan as a sacrifice for his exclusion of dissidents. Zesheng and others, deceived, threatened, and coerced by Chiang and his reactionary clique, traveled across the ocean under the close supervision of his direct line troops, and went to the Northeast anti-people battlefield, violating the interests of the people and resisting the people's army. For the past two years, every time I think about this, I feel extremely painful. Although we had long harbored the intention to save ourselves and others, we were afraid of the fierce flames of the special agent policy and being poisoned; on the other hand, we lacked a suitable and favorable opportunity, and have been enduring until now, filled with shame and regret. When we were surrounded in Changchun, we witnessed the various tragic situations caused by the anti-people war essence of Chiang, and resolutely led all the officers and soldiers of the entire army to revolt on the front line of Changchun on October 17, throwing ourselves into the embrace of the people, seeking to atone for our past mistakes, and moving towards the light. Now the entire army has arrived in the rear of the Liberated Area under the warm love and guidance of the leaders of the Party, government, and army in the Liberated Area, and the enthusiastic welcome and assistance of the people of the Liberated Area. Now, our army and soldiers have escaped from the sinful sea of suffering and regained the bright road, and are all rejoicing. Especially since the revolt, we have received preferential treatment from the People's Government of the Liberated Area, whose sincere and genuine concern and care far exceeded what Zesheng and others dared to expect. And the people of the Liberated Area's peaceful and prosperous life, and their spirit of courageously forging ahead, are also beyond what Zesheng and others could imagine. Looking back on the past, it is like another life, and we have come to understand the true meaning of the people's century and the bright future for us soldiers. Recalling that Chiang, since stealing the power of the country, has taken pleasure in harming and abusing the people, and glory in selling out the country and enriching himself. For twenty years, the sound of counter-revolutionary civil war has not ceased, and for more than twenty years, the people's revolutionary struggle has been surging. Now, the invincible power of the Chinese People's Liberation Army has turned Chiang's struggles and cries into despair. The capture of Wang Yaowu and Fan Hanjie alive among his direct line generals, the complete and thorough annihilation of the Liao Yaoxiang Corps, and Zheng Dongguo leading his troops to collectively surrender to the people, all prove that the people's army is invincible, proving that defending is impossible, fighting is unwinnable, and running is inescapable. All dying struggles are ineffective. There are only three paths in front of the Chiang army across the country: either be annihilated, or surrender to the people, or stand on the side of the people and stage a glorious revolt. There are also many insightful people among the officers and soldiers of the Chiang army. Where to go, what to do, now is the time! The local non-direct line troops in the Chiang army must examine themselves: Are you going to follow Chiang Kai-shek, the traitorous and dictatorial man, into the grave with his pathetic behavior? Or will you resolutely stand on the side of the people and seek a bright future? Time is running out, and we hope you will wake up quickly and make a decision. We can't express all we want to say in this letter.

　　Former Commander of the Tenth Army Zeng Zesheng, Commander of the 182nd Division Bai Zhaoxue, Commander of the 21st Division Long Yao, Commander of the 52nd Division Li Zuo and all officers and soldiers respectfully

　　November 29th

　　曾泽生等促醒蒋军起义投降：
    一切垂死挣扎都是无效何去何从现在是时候了
    【新华社哈尔滨三十日电】长春起义的曾泽生将军等顷发表告国民党军官兵书，希望国民党军赶快觉悟，不要再替蒋介石反动派卖命。原书如下：全国国民党军官兵均鉴：
    抗战胜利以后，蒋介石假其一贯的阴谋伎俩，一面以受降为借口，调我全军远戌河内；一面即制造昆明事变，以云南人民为其排斥异己的牺牲品。泽生等遭蒋贼及其反动集团的蒙蔽欺骗，威胁压迫远涉重洋，在其嫡系部队的严密监视歧遇下，开赴东北反人民战场，违背人民利益，抗拒人民军队。两年以来，每念及此，内心痛苦万分。我等虽早存自救救人之心，但一面慑于特务政策之凶焰，恐遭毒手；一面苦无适当有利时机，隐忍迄今，愧悔交集。及至被围长春，更目击由于蒋贼反人民战争之本质所造成之种种惨不忍睹的困境，乃毅然于十月十七日率全军将士在长春前线起义，投入人民怀抱，图赎前愆，走向光明。现全军在解放区党政军各首长的热诚爱护指导下，解放区人民的热烈欢迎协助下，已开抵解放区后方。现我军将士已超脱罪恶苦海，重获光明大路，莫不欢欣鼓舞。尤以起义以来，备受解放区人民政府之优待，其真挚赤诚关切照顾，远非泽生等所敢于期望者。而解放区人民的安居乐业，奋勇直前的精神，亦非泽生等所能于想象者。回顾既往，恍若隔世，始悟人民世纪之真谛，及我辈军人之光明出路。回忆蒋贼自盗窃国柄，始即以残民虐人为乐，卖国自肥为荣。廿年来，反革命内战的枪声未绝，二十余年来，人民的革命斗争风起云涌。现在中国人民解放军无敌的威力，已使蒋贼的挣扎呼号变成绝望。其嫡系将领中王耀武、范汉杰被生擒，廖耀湘兵团被干净彻底消灭，郑洞国率部向人民集体投降，均证明人民的军队是无敌的，证明守是守不成，战是战不过，跑又跑不脱，一切垂死的挣扎都是无效的。摆在全国蒋军前面的只有三条路：或是被歼灭，或是向人民投降，或是站在人民方面来举行光荣的起义。蒋军官兵中亦不乏有识之士，何去何从，该是时候了！蒋军中非嫡系的地方部队，更须自审：你们是随蒋介石卖国独夫为其可悲的行为一起进坟墓呢？还是毅然站在人民方面来，求一条光明的出路呢？时不可失，希能猛省速决。临书企望，不尽欲言。
    前第十军军长曾泽生　第一八二师师长白肇学　第二十一师师长陇耀　第五十二师师长李佐率全体官兵谨启
    十一月二十九日
