Methods for Preventing Frostbite in the Troops
    Qian Xinzhong

Frostbite is most likely to occur when the weather suddenly turns cold, especially in the morning. People become accustomed to the cold, and even temperatures below zero may not cause frostbite. However, when the weather suddenly turns cold and the body is not accustomed to it or prepared for the cold, frostbite is more likely to occur. Therefore, many people often get frostbite when going from a house to a hilltop for sentry duty, or when marching over high mountains. The areas most susceptible to frostbite are the hands, feet, earlobes, and tip of the nose. Those most likely to suffer from frostbite are people who are weak, have a weak heart, have previously suffered from frostbite, or do not exercise much. Therefore, wounded soldiers are most prone to frostbite.

Reasons why frostbite is common during wartime: clothes are not often washed, shoes and socks are damp, shoes and socks are too tight, and people are hungry and tired.

Preventive measures: (1) Have warm cotton (leather) hats and dry shoes and socks.

(2) Exercise before and during sentry duty, and lay dry grass in the trenches.

(3) Regularly rub the ears, nose, and hands, and do foot exercises.

(4) When it is too cold, drink hot soup (thin porridge, noodle soup) while on sentry duty on the hilltop to increase body temperature.

(5) Keep the wounded warm by putting on cotton socks and trousers, filling the stretcher with more grass (the thickness of the padding is as important as the blankets), and adding heated bricks next to the feet. This can keep them warm for 1-2 hours and can also be used to immobilize the limbs. However, be careful to prevent burns.

(6) A wounded soldier reception station should be set up every 15-20 li to give them hot bricks and hot soup.

Treatment methods: When frontline medical personnel discover someone suffering from frostbite, they should first decide to warm them by rubbing, using fire, or using warm water. The fear of using fire is a past theory. The Soviet Union has proven that immediately using fire to treat frostbite only has benefits and no harm. The theory that it will worsen if burned applies to already damaged tissue that would die even without burning.

Isn't it also proven by people's experience that when feet are numb from frostbite, they feel comfortable after being warmed by fire and there are no adverse effects? The old methods were to gradually heat, first going into a cold room and then slowly into a warmer room. For the local area, first rub with something cold, gradually increasing the temperature. These two methods should be applied according to the degree of frostbite.

Treatment methods for each stage of frostbite:

First-degree frostbite: Capillary paralysis, first pale skin, then red spots, slightly swollen. As long as you frequently rub the red spots or wash with hot water, dry, wrap with cotton, or wear gloves to keep warm, it will heal.

Second-degree frostbite: More severe than first-degree, local circulatory disorder, edema with blisters, skin turns bluish-purple to blackish-red. No infection occurs. The blisters are absorbed into a scab and heal. Or, use sterilized scissors to cut off the blisters, apply alcohol or 5% @ acid, form a scab, and wrap with a compressive bandage to heal.

Third and fourth degree: Frozen for too long plus dampness. Blood clots form in the blood vessels, causing the tissue to lose vitality. Such as the thin parts of the earwings, the tip of the nose; as fragile as glass, it needs to be treated by a good doctor. In the early stage, arterial injection of high-pressure glucose saline may save it. Otherwise, wait for the demarcation line to become clear before dealing with the necrotic area. The doctor must turn wet gangrene into dry gangrene by cutting it open. Necrotic soft tissue can be removed earlier, but bone is not allowed to be sawn off. Treatment should be done after the demarcation line is clear.

　　部队预防冻伤的办法
    钱信忠
    冻伤最易发生于乍冷的时候，尤为早晨。人们对寒冷有了习惯即便是零度以下不见得就生冻伤；但天气突然变冷，人体尚无习惯或御寒准备时，反而易犯。因此从房子里到山岗上去放哨，或行军过高山，常常冻坏不少人。冻伤易发生的部位：手、足、耳壳、鼻尖。冻伤最易侵犯的对象：身体弱、心脏弱，已患过冻伤，不好运动的人，因此伤员最易发生冻伤。
    冻伤在战时易犯的原因：衣服不常换洗，鞋袜潮湿，鞋袜太窄饥饿疲劳。
    预防办法：（一）要有防寒的棉（皮）帽干燥的鞋袜。
    （二）换哨前放哨时要运动，战壕里要铺干草。
    （三）经常摩擦耳、鼻、手及踏脚运动。
    （四）太冷的时候在山头放哨要喝热汤（稀饭面汤）增加体温。
    （五）伤员的保暖，穿棉袜、盖棉裤子，担架下多填草，铺的厚薄和盖的一样重要，脚旁加热砖，既能保暖１——２小时，又能作肢体固定用。但要防止火伤。
    （六）１５——２０里路应设一伤兵招待站，给他们换热砖喝热汤。
    治疗办法：前线医务人员一发现受冻的人时，首先决定给他取暖摩擦用火烤，用热温水暖，怕用火烤是已往的理论，苏联已经证明，冻伤立即用火烤只有好处没有害处。一烤就坏的学说是适用在已冻坏的组织即便不烤也得坏死的。
    人们的经验不是也证明着，脚冻麻木了用火烤后即舒服未见有啥变化，已往的方法：渐渐的加热，先到一个冷的室中，再慢慢进到较暖的房室中。局部先用冷的东西摩擦，渐渐加高温度，这两种方法要根据冻伤的程度来应用。
    各期冻伤的治法：
    第一期冻伤，毛细血管麻痹，先皮肤苍白，后发红斑，略肿胀，只要勤摩擦红班部或用热水洗后擦干，用棉花包好，或戴手套，保暖即愈。
    第二期冻伤，较第一期重，局部循环障碍浮肿起水泡，皮肤变成青紫黑红色，不发生传染，水泡被吸收成一痂皮而愈。或用消毒剪子剪去水泡，用酒精，５％的＠酸涂抹，成痂皮缠上压迫绷带而愈。
    第三、四期，受冻过久加上潮湿。血管中形成血拴，致组织失去生活力。如耳翼、鼻尖之薄弱部；象玻璃一样的易折断，须要好医生来治疗，在早期可用动脉注射高×压葡萄糖食盐水，可能挽救。不然的话，要待分界线分明后，再处理坏疽部。医生要使湿性坏疽变为干性坏疽就得切开。软组织坏死部，可早一点切除，但不许锯去骨头。要等待分界线明显后再作处理。
