(Taihang Telegram) Amidst the cheers of the great victory of the autumn offensive, Huixian and Anyang in the Fifth Military Sub-district have launched an enthusiastic enlistment movement. Last month, the aforementioned regions successively held mass celebration rallies. Some regions organized joint celebrations involving several villages and extensively carried out current affairs propaganda movements, greatly raising the revolutionary awareness of the peasants. They were encouraged by the victorious situation, where "it may only take about a year to fundamentally overthrow the Kuomintang reactionary government." They consciously demanded to join the People's Liberation Army, quickly defeat the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, liberate the whole country as soon as possible, and thoroughly turn themselves over to live a good life. In Huixian, on the 23rd and 24th alone, 596 young people enthusiastically signed up to join the army in nine districts. After in-depth discussions on current affairs and specific resolution of ideological problems in Baobi Town, the peasants all said, "We should quickly expand our ranks and overthrow the feudal root Chiang Kai-shek as soon as possible." Wu Jiude, a fisherman from Yucun, said when he signed up, "Victory is coming in about a year, if we don't do it now, when will we?" In Anyang's Second District, the enlistment task was successfully completed in less than a week. At the beginning of the enlistment movement, party members and cadres carried forward the glorious historical tradition, actively signed up to be pioneers, personally took the lead, or mobilized their relatives to join the army. Militiamen who had rendered meritorious service in the struggle against the enemy in the border areas also scrambled to join the People's Liberation Army to make great contributions. Wang Dasheng, the branch secretary of Shangjie Branch in Baobi Town, Huixian, led five young people to sign up for the army. Feng Xihe, the captain of the Tugao Village self-defense force, was the first to sign up and led 27 people to join the army. In Anyang's Xi'aikou, party member Wang Jin responded to the call of the branch and set an example by mobilizing his brother Wang Jinru to join the army. In the conscious enlistment movement, where men, women, young and old were all mobilized to expand the victorious army, many outstanding young people, model families, and model women emerged everywhere. They clarified the consistency of class and national interests with their own interests, and their consciousness was even higher. After the celebration meeting, the three brothers Wang Naiwen, farmers from Tianzhuang, Huixian, immediately held a family meeting to discuss joining the army. After democratic consultation, the young and capable third son, Wang Naiwen, automatically went to sign up. Zhang Fu, a retired soldier's family member from Yanglijiao, was bankrupted by the Kuomintang in the old society, and only turned over after the Communist Party came. His eldest son had just returned from retirement, and this time he persuaded his second son to sign up for the army. The women's captain of Baobi Town mobilized her son to join the army. Zhang Caigen's mother from Miaogang Village was determined to avenge her eldest son, who had been forced to become an enemy soldier, and automatically sent her second son to join the People's Liberation Army. She said, "You defeat Chiang Kai-shek as soon as possible, and our whole family will be reunited."

    【太行电】全区在欢庆秋季攻势的伟大胜利声中，五分区辉县、安阳已掀起了热烈的参军运动。在上月，上述地区均先后召开了群众祝捷大会，有的地区数村联合庆祝，并广泛展开时事宣传运动，大大提高了农民革命觉悟。他们为“只需要一年左右就可能从根本上打倒国民党反动政府”之胜利形势所鼓舞，纷纷自觉要求参加解放军，赶快打垮蒋匪军，早日解放全国，彻底翻身过时光。辉县在二十三、四日两天，九个区即有五百九十六名青壮年奋勇报名参军。该县薄壁镇经过深入讨论时事具体解决思想问题后，农民都说“应该赶快扩大咱们的队伍，早一天打倒封建老根蒋介石。”渔村农民吴九德报名时说：“一年左右就要胜利，这时不干啥时干。”安阳二区不到一周，参军任务已胜利完成。参军运动开始时，党员干部发扬了光荣的历史传统，纷纷报名打先锋，亲自带头或动员自己亲人参军。边区对敌斗争中有功的民兵们，亦争先参加解放军以立大功。辉县薄壁镇上街支部书记王大胜，带领五个青年报名参军。土高村自卫队大队长冯喜和，第一个报名，并带领二十七人参了军。安阳西艾口党员王金的响应支部号召，以身作则动员其兄弟王金如参了军。在男女老少一齐动员，努力扩大胜利军的自觉参军运动中，到处涌现出许多优秀青年、模范家庭、模范妇女，他们明确了阶级国家利益与自己利益的一致性，自觉性更高。辉县田庄农民王乃文兄弟三人开罢庆祝大会后，立即召开家庭会讨论参军，经过民主商量，年青能干的老三王乃文，自动去报名。羊利郊荣退军人家属张富，在旧社会曾被国民党搜刮破产，共产党来了后才翻身，大儿刚荣退回来，这次他又劝说二孩子去报名参军。薄壁镇妇女队长动员儿子参军，苗岗村张才根的母亲，决心要为其被强迫当了敌军的大儿子报仇，自动送二儿子参加人民解放军。她说：“你早日打败蒋介石，咱全家好团圆。”
