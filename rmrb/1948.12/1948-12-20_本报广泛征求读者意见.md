Respectfully Requesting Readers' Opinions:

    Since its publication, this newspaper has been nurtured and cared for by all sectors, and it has now begun to take shape. To further improve our work and meet the needs of our broad readership, we are taking the opportunity at the end of 1948 to solicit opinions widely from all Party, government, military, and civilian organizations, groups, fellow professionals, and the broad readership to improve our work. We hope to launch a lively discussion in the newspaper on cherishing the Party newspaper and improving the Party newspaper. The following questions are listed for reference:

    First, what are your opinions on the four pages of the newspaper? What do you like to read most? What do you dislike reading?

    Second, what are your opinions on current affairs news and local news? What interests you the most? What interests you the least?

    Third, which reporters' dispatches or news stories do you think are well-written, and which are not, and why?

    Fourth, which news reports or dispatches do you know have played a concrete guiding role in practical work, and which have played a bad role or even made mistakes?

    Fifth, what are your opinions on the "Editor-Reader Interaction," "Voices of the Masses," and "Criticisms and Suggestions" sections? Have these issues played a role? What are your opinions on the newspaper's handling of these issues? Is this format good? How should it be improved in the future?

    Sixth, what do you think the four pages should publish more of? What are your opinions on the already published literary works, dispatches, study discussions, experiences, insights, notes, etc.? What else do you want us to publish?

    Seventh, what are your opinions on the layout, printing, and distribution of the newspaper? Do you receive the newspaper regularly, and how quickly? Can you provide some good ideas?

    Eighth, what are your opinions on the Communications and Liaison Section? How is your connection with each other? Does the newspaper have a bureaucratic style?

    Ninth, in addition to the above questions, what other areas do you feel the newspaper needs to improve?

    第二、你对时事新闻、地方新闻有什么意见，那些最使你感兴趣，那些你最不感兴趣？
    第三、你认为那些记者的通讯或新闻写得好，那些不好，为什么？
    第四、你知道在那些新闻通讯对实际工作起了具体的指导作用，那些是起了坏的作用，甚至犯了错误？
    第五，你对编读往来、群众呼声、批评与建议有什么意见，这些问题是否都起到一些作用？对本报关于这些问题的处理，你有什么意见？这样形式好不好？今后应如何改进。
