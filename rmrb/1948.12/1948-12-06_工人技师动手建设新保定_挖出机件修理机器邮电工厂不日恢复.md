[Jizhong Telegram] Reporter's Attentive Report: On November 23rd, the day after Baoding's liberation, the reporter visited people from all walks of life in the city. In addition to accusing the Chiang bandits of burning and looting, they also took practical actions to actively welcome and assist the People's Liberation Army. Workers and technicians are actively cooperating with the democratic government to restore the post and telecommunications and factories in the city that were severely damaged by the Chiang Kai-shek and Fu Zuoyi bandit troops. Technicians and workers at the electric light company have begun repairing machinery, saying, "As long as there is coal, it will not be difficult to resume work." Some workers said, "As soon as the fighting stopped, we ran out of our homes and checked the power lines." Others said, "When I heard at home that the enemy had burned down the electric light company, I was so anxious. I went up to the roof and saw that the fire hadn't reached the machine room, and I was relieved. You know, the machine room is our rice bowl; how can we let the Kuomintang break our bowl?" Workers and staff members of the telegraph bureau, telephone bureau, and post office, in order to protect machinery and documents, some had already blocked the gates and sealed the documents during the battle. After the People's Liberation Army arrived, some took the initiative to find us to take over and investigate, and clearly accounted for the buried gasoline and telephones. Most of the employees have automatically registered. All sectors of the city are preparing to resume work, classes, and market operations. Citizens are in groups in front of their doors, on the streets, or at intersections, talking and laughing with staff and People's Liberation Army soldiers. Some old ladies warmly take the hands of cadres and soldiers and say, "Come, come to my house for dinner!" After the announcement of the pacification notice and propaganda materials, citizens scrambled to read them. When people posting the announcements walked east on the road, the people flowed east; when they walked west on the road, they were still surrounded. They said, "The actions of the People's Liberation Army and what is written on the announcement are exactly the same; now we have a solid foundation." When staff members were painting over Chiang Kai-shek's slogans and writing our slogans, some people automatically made paste, and some personally helped with the painting. The people of Xiguan lined up to welcome the People's Liberation Army, and colorful flags with "Long Live Chairman Mao" were hung at their doors. The cinema, in celebration of the liberation of Baoding, is preparing for a free performance. Managers of stores such as Wenxingzhan in the Second District, in celebration of the liberation of Baoding and the prosperity of the market, will implement a five-day big sale. Primary and secondary schools are rapidly recovering, and within days, three primary schools and one middle school will be officially opened. Students of the Hui Nationality Primary School in a certain street in the Second District followed our staff members and asked innocently, "When will we start school?" Citizens have also reported the enemy's hidden military supplies everywhere. According to what has already been found, there are a lot of grain, bullets, and timber. The priest of the Catholic Gongjiao Hospital also took the initiative to report the timber and hand grenades to us. They take the initiative to report all the materials of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits as their responsibility, considering it a merit, and feel infinite joy and glory.
[Baoding Telegram] The Baoding Military Control Commission is leading more than 100,000 citizens to fully carry out restoration work and heal the deep wounds caused by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits. The temporary aid stations established by the Military Control Commission are providing round-the-clock medical care to citizens who have been bombed, strafed, and killed by Chiang's aircraft. The democratic government is rushing to transport a large number of necessities such as coal and grain, and wholesale them to private coal and grain stores for sale to citizens in need. The Baoding coal store industry, which was on the verge of death due to the destruction by the Chiang Kai-shek and Fu Zuoyi bandit troops, has also been revived, and groups of hungry citizens are going to the state-owned grain stores to buy grain. The city's post office began communicating with all liberated areas across the country on the second day after liberation. Some employees of the telecommunications bureau, after being deceived and propagandized by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits for a long time, initially had some concerns about us. The Military Control Commission immediately explained our party's various urban policies to them, announcing that as long as they worked actively, they would retain their original positions and salaries. Their concerns gradually disappeared, and they came to register one after another. They are now checking machines and repairing lines separately, and will be able to talk on the phone in a few days. All seven major fire organizations in the city—the Bao'an Water Society—have been restored one after another.
