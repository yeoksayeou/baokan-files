The workers in the liberated areas are giving play to their consciousness and creativity, striving to improve technology and increase production. Zhao Jujin, a young worker from Jin-Sui, has set a good example in this regard. He invented a machine for manufacturing a certain part of artillery shells, making a significant contribution to artillery shell production. The new machine is only one-fifth or one-sixth the size of the old machine, but increases production by 60%, and the product quality fully meets standards, with no rejects. What is particularly important is that the new machine is easy to master; new apprentices can learn to use it in just two or three days. The old machine could only be mastered by skilled workers, requiring six months to a year to learn, and even skilled workers found it difficult to ensure that all products fully met standards. Therefore, the invention of the new machine greatly improved the production of a certain part of artillery shells. The Logistics Department of the Jin-Sui Military Region sent a letter of commendation to Comrade Zhao Jujin, the inventor of the machine, awarding him 1 million Farmer Dollars, and calling on all logistics staff to learn from his spirit of studying technology and improving work. The machine has been named the "Jujin Model" machine.

Zhao Jujin is 24 years old, a member of the Communist Party, and was originally a farmer's child from Zhangtou Village, Kelan County. When he was sixteen years old, he started working in a factory of the Jin-Sui Logistics Department. He has always been active in his work, eight years as one day, and has won the honorary titles of Labor Hero, Model Worker, and Production Meritorious Worker. Before he invented the new machine, although he was already a skilled worker, his production volume always remained at a certain level, unable to break through. He often said to people: "Is it because I'm not working hard enough? No. I am working with all my strength. Is it because I'm wasting time on the job? No. I always arrive early and leave late, even running when going to the toilet. But why can't production volume be increased?" He was troubled by this for a long time, and after work he often walked around the machine, finally realizing that the machine itself was limiting increased production. So he put all his effort into trying to改造 (transform) the machine. He spent every day learning to draw blueprints on the ground and on paper, even designing in his dreams at night. After about a month of research, he finally figured out the entire structure of the machine and made the blueprints. When his trial production request was quickly approved by the factory, he began manufacturing. To overcome the difficulty of materials, he used his rest time after work every day to personally pick out usable waste materials from the warehouse, repair and assemble them. At this time, although he heard some fellow workers joking that he was a "little monkey trying to become a spirit," he did not lose heart and was determined to achieve success through hard work. After two months of painstaking manufacturing, he finally assembled the new machine. The Logistics Department of the Jin-Sui Military Region said in its letter of commendation to Zhao Jujin: "Your creation illustrates two issues: First, the masses possess vast creativity, and the question is how leaders organize and unleash this creativity, and how the masses consciously cultivate and use this creativity. Second, invention and creation are not limited to people with specialized technology and knowledge (of course, people with specialized technology and knowledge are more qualified to invent and create, so it is necessary to study specialized technology and knowledge), the primary question is whether or not one studies diligently."

　　晋绥青年工人赵举进发明造炮弹零件机器
    解放区的工人，正在发挥着他们的自觉性与创造性，为改进技术、提高生产而努力。晋绥青年工人赵举进在这方面作出了一个好榜样。他发明了一部制造炮弹某一部分机件的机器，对炮弹生产贡献甚大。该新机器只有旧机器体积的五、六分之一，产量增加百分之六十，产品质量完全合乎标准，没有废货。特别重要的是新机器容易掌握，新学徒只需两三天时间即能学会使用。旧机器则只有技工才能掌握，需半年至一年才能学会，而且即使是熟练工人也难使所有产品完全合乎标准。因此，新机器的发明，大大改进了炮弹某一部分机件的生产。晋绥军区后勤部特致函嘉勉该机器的发明者赵举进同志，奖以农币一百万元，并号召全体后勤职工学习他钻研技术、改进工作的精神。该机器已定名为“举进式”机。
    赵举进现年二十四岁，共产党员，原是岢岚县掌头村的一个农民的孩子。当他还是十六岁时便进晋绥后勤部某工厂做工，工作一贯积极，八年如一日，曾连获劳动英雄、模范工作者、生产功臣等光荣称号。在他没有发明新的机器之前，虽然已是熟练工人，但生产量总是停在一定的水平线上，无法突破。他常对人说：“是不用力吗？不是。我是用尽全力工作的。是做工误时吗？也不是。我总是早上工、迟下工，连去大小便都是跑步的。但产量为什么总提不高呢？”他为此苦恼了好久，下工后常常在机器旁边走来走去，最后才恍然大悟，原来机器本身限制了增加产量。于是他便用尽心思设法改造机器。他天天在地上和纸上学着画图样，甚至连夜里做梦也在设计。经过一个月左右的钻研，他终于想出了全部机器的构造，制就了图样。当他的试制要求很快得到厂部的批准后，他就动手制造。为克服材料的困难，他利用每天下工后的休息时间，亲自到仓库中去拣出可以利用的废货，回来加以修理装配。这时，他虽然听到个别工友取笑他“小毛猴还想成精”的闲言，但毫不灰心，抱定“功到自然成”的决心。经过两个月的苦心制造，他终于装成了新机器。晋绥军区后勤部在致赵举进的嘉奖信中说：“你的创造说明了两个问题：第一，群众中蕴藏着广大的创造力，问题在于领导者怎样去组织与发挥这一创造力，和群众怎样自觉地来锻炼与使用这一创造力。第二，发明和创造并不限于具有专门的技术和知识的人（自然有专门的技术和知识的人更有条件去发明和创造，因此必须学习专门的技术和知识），问题首先在于钻研不钻研。”
