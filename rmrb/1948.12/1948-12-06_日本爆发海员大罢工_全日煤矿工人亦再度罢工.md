Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 3rd: Reports from various sources: A seamen's strike has erupted in Japan, with approximately 460 ships frozen in fifteen ports including Yokohama and Osaka, paralyzing maritime transport throughout Japan. The strike is led by the "All Japan Seamen's Union," which has 40,000 members. In negotiations with the government on the 28th, the union demanded a 30% wage increase retroactive to June of this year. Japanese Minister of Transportation Ozawa did not provide a clear guarantee to the union leaders' demands, and the negotiations broke down. The union then ordered a 48-hour strike to begin at midnight on November 29th. The seamen stated that if their demands were not met by December 4th, they would conduct another 72-hour strike.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 3rd: Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, November 30th: 145,000 coal miners throughout Japan went on strike today because negotiations between union leaders and mine owners have failed. This strike will involve all 450,000 Japanese miners in a 24-hour strike. The strike will take place in different regions each day in order to spread throughout Japan within three days. This strike is the second strike in November. The first wave of strikes occurred from November 10th to November 17th. The current strike was ordered despite a serious warning from the occupying authorities on November 22nd. Union leaders were warned at the time that miners who hindered coal production would be punished.

　　日本爆发海员大罢工
  　全日煤矿工人亦再度罢工
    【新华社陕北三日电】各方报导：日本爆发海员大罢工，约有四百六十艘船只被冻结在包括横滨、大坂在内的十五个港口中，全日海运已陷于瘫痪状态。此次罢工由拥有会员四万人的“全日海员工会”所领导，该工会和政府在二十八日的谈判中，曾提出增加工资百分之三十并追溯至本年六月的要求，日政府运输相小泽对工会领袖们的要求未予明确的保证，谈判乃告破裂，该工会即下令自十一月二十九日午夜开始罢工四十八小时，海员方面表示，他们的要求如在十二月四日以前仍未能满足，则将再进行七十二小时的罢工。
    【新华社陕北三日电】法新社东京十一月三十日讯：全日煤矿工人十四万五千人今日举行罢工，因为工会领袖们和矿主之间的谈判已告失败。这一罢工将使全体日本矿工四十五万人均卷入二十四小时罢工。罢工每日将在不同的地区进行，以便在三日内扩及日本全国。这一罢工是十一月的第二次罢工。第一次罢工浪潮发生于十一月十日至十一月十七日。目前的这一罢工是不顾占领当局十一月二十二日的严重警告而下令进行的，工会领袖们当时曾被警告称，妨碍煤产的矿工将予惩处。
