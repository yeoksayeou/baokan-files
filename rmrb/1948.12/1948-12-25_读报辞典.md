　　Dominion—Also called autonomous colony. It is a type of colony ruled by British imperialism. In order to alleviate the growing resistance of the people in its colonies, British imperialism nominally grants some colonies a bit of legislative and administrative "autonomy." They can send their own envoys to foreign countries, but defense, diplomacy, and all other matters are still controlled by the British Empire. Examples include Canada, the Union of South Africa, Australia, and the current Hindustan and Pakistan.

　　Muslim League—Abbreviated as Hui Meng, it is an organization of Muslims in India. It has great influence among Muslims and is one of the three major political parties in India (the other two being the Communist Party of India and the Indian National Congress). It is an organization representing large landlords and gentry. Later, it developed to have two million members and was controlled by upper-class Muslims such as Jinnah (who died in September). For many years, British imperialism has used the ethnic disputes between India and Muslims as a tool to control India. Now, on the surface, the Muslim League is the ruling party of Pakistan, but in reality, it is still dominated by British imperialism.

　　Bevin—A person's name. He is the current British Foreign Secretary (Minister of Foreign Affairs), a member of the British Labour Party. Since the end of World War II, his foreign policy has been following the United States. The Communist Party of Great Britain, the British people, and progressive members of the Labour Party all oppose, criticize, and protest his foreign policy.

　　CIO—That is, the Congress of Industrial Organizations, established in November 1935. It is an organization of basic industrial workers in the United States (such as steel, hardware, electrical materials, etc.). It has about six million members. It is a more progressive and influential trade union in the United States. Many communists are among its members, and the chairman is also a democrat. However, some of the upper-level leaders are also relatively reactionary and bow to monopoly capitalists.

　　AFL—That is, the American Federation of Labor, established in 1881. It was formed by various independent handicraft trade unions at that time. Now, most of its members are also light industry, construction industry, and handicraft trade unions, with about six million members. However, because it is more conservative and scattered, its influence is not as great as the CIO. Its负责人 are reactionary, betraying the working class, and acting as agents of monopoly capitalists. Therefore, internal struggles are very fierce, and the democratic elements inside it often fight to overthrow the leaders.

    自治领——又叫自治殖民地。是英帝国主义所统治的殖民地中的一种。英帝国为缓和其殖民地人民日益增长的反抗，名义上给某些殖民地一点立法、行政上的“自主”权，它可以自派使节驻在外国，但国防、外交等一切事项，还是为英帝国所支配，例如加拿大、南非联邦、澳大利亚，现在的印度斯坦与巴基斯坦等就是。
    回教联盟——简称回盟，是印度回教徒中的一个组织，在回教徒中的势力很大，也是印度三大政党之一（另二大党是印度共产党及印度国民大会党）。是一个代表大地主、士绅的组织，后来发展到有会员二百万，为回教上层人物如金纳等所掌握（金纳已在九月间死去），英帝国主义多年来就利用印回的民族纠纷为其控制印度的工具，现在表面上回教联盟已是巴基斯坦的执政党了，实际上仍然受着英帝国主义支配。
    贝文——人名。为现在英国的外相（外交部长），是英国工党的一员，自第二次世界大战结束以来，其所执行的外交政策都是追随着美帝跑，英国共产党和英国人民以及工党中的进步分子，对其所执行的外交政策，无不反对、批评与抗议。
    产联——即产业职工联合会，成立于一九三五年十一月，是美国基本工业工人（如钢铁、五金、电料等）的组织，会员有六百万左右，是美国较进步的、影响最大的工会，其中并有许多共产党员，主席也是民主人士。不过上层领导分子中也有一部分是比较反动的，向独占资本家低头的。
    劳联——即美国劳工联合会，成立于一八八一年，是由当时各个独立的手艺工会组成的，现在会员也大部是轻工业、建筑工业及手工业工会，会员也有六百万左右。但因较保守、较散漫，影响不如产联大。它的负责人是反动的，是叛卖工人阶级的，做了独占资本家的代理人。所以内部斗争很厉害，它里面的民主分子常作推翻领导人的斗争。
