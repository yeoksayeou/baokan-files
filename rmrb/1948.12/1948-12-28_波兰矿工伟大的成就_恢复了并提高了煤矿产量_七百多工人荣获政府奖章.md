　　Great Achievements of Polish Miners
  　Restoring and Increasing Coal Production
    More Than Seven Hundred Workers Awarded Government Medals
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th Dispatch] TASS reports: Thanks to the patriotic efforts of Polish miners, Polish coal mines have achieved remarkable success – this is the comment of a reporter from the Soviet newspaper Labor regarding the production situation of miners in the Dąbrowa coal region in northeastern Poland. The reporter stated: Since the Soviet army defeated the Hitlerite bandits and returned this rich coal region to Poland, thousands of miners have enthusiastically started to restore the damaged mines. Now, all the mines have resumed operation. Monthly coal production has increased from 750,000 tons to 6 million tons. The miners have launched a campaign to increase labor productivity. More than 20 percent of Dąbrowa's miners have exceeded their production quotas. The group led by miner Budgol completed three to four times the monthly output. All 120 mining teams in the Dąbrowa region are learning from this experience of increasing production. Currently, 768 miners have received orders and medals from the Polish government for their labor achievements, while Budgol and dozens of other model workers have been awarded the Gold Cross Medal.

　　波兰矿工伟大的成就
  　恢复了并提高了煤矿产量
    七百多工人荣获政府奖章
    【新华社陕北二十六日电】塔斯社讯：由于波兰矿工的爱国努力，波兰煤矿已获得惊人的成就——这是苏联劳动报记者对于波兰东北部顿姆勃罗瓦煤区矿工生产状况的评语。该记者称：自从苏军击败希特勒匪帮，把这一富饶煤区交还波兰以后，数以千计的矿工就热情地开始恢复被破坏的矿井。现在，所有矿井都已开工。每月产煤已由七十五万吨增加到六百万吨。矿工们发起了提高劳动生产率的运动。百分之二十以上的顿姆勃罗瓦的矿工超过了他们的生产定额。矿工布德戈尔的一组，完成了每月产量的三倍到四倍。顿姆勃罗瓦全区一百二十组矿井工人，都在学习这种提高产量的经验。现有七六八名矿工因劳动功绩已得到波兰政府的勋章与奖章，布德戈尔及其他数十名模范工人则荣膺金十字奖章。
