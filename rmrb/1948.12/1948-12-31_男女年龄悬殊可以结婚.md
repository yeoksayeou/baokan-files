　　Large Age Gaps Between Men and Women are Permissible for Marriage
    Question: A man is forty years old, and a woman is twenty years old. After several conversations, they both voluntarily want to marry. However, the age difference is too large. Is this permissible for marriage? Are there any restrictions in the marriage regulations?
  　　　　Jingxing Third District, Wang Huaishu
    Answer: Marriage must be free, autonomous, and voluntary. Marriage must be built on the harmony of emotions and will between the man and woman. Therefore, as long as the marriage is consensual, no one has the right to interfere, regardless of the age difference. In terms of legal marriage age, there are no other restrictions other than that men under 20 and women under 18 are not allowed to marry.

　　男女年龄悬殊可以结婚
    问：男方四十岁，女方二十岁，他俩经过几次谈话，完全由于双方自愿结婚，可是年龄相差太多，这样是否可以结婚呢？婚烟条例上有没有限制？
  　　　　井陉三区　王怀书
    答：婚姻须自由、自主、自愿。婚烟须建筑在男女双方感情意志的融洽上。所以只要是两相情愿的姻婚无论岁数相差多少，他人都无权干涉。结婚年龄在法律上除男不满二十、女不满十八不得结婚外，没有其他的限制。
