Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 8th: The Northeast Administrative Committee Grain Bureau convened a meeting of grain bureau directors from various provinces and cities in the Northeast (excluding Rehe Province and the cities of Shenyang and Changchun) on the 5th of last month. The meeting discussed ensuring the completion of this year's grain requisition work, as well as important issues regarding the collection, storage, allocation, transportation, and processing of public grain. The meeting lasted for five days and concluded on the 9th. The meeting believed that under the new situation of the liberation of the entire Northeast, in order to shoulder the heavy responsibility of supporting the large-scale war to liberate the entire country, it is necessary to improve the efficiency of grain work in various parts of the Northeast and make it more planned and standardized to ensure the grain supply for military needs and industrial sectors. This year, in addition to completing the tasks of collecting public grain, delivering it to warehouses, and putting it into storage, various parts of the Northeast must summarize past experiences in storing public grain, improve storage methods, and avoid mildew, rot, and waste. In the process of regularly summarizing work, attention should be paid to training cadres, strengthening policy education, discipline education, and unified centralized ideological education for cadres. Oppose empiricism, improve working methods, and establish a more sound system for various grain-related tasks. The meeting made the following important decisions regarding grain work in the Northeast in the future:

	(1) On the issue of public grain requisition and storage. All provinces must truly complete the grain requisition tasks stipulated by the state. Farmers must transport the public grain they pay to designated locations for storage. Except for special areas where transportation is impossible, the provincial government must submit a report to the Northeast Political Committee for approval before other arrangements can be made. The grain bureaus of each province must conduct in-depth inspections and supervision of the grain requisition work and submit a statistical report of actual collection to the provincial government and the Grain Bureau every five days. When grain depots receive public grain, they must strictly check the quality before storing it. From the Grain Bureau to the grain depot, all parties must be responsible for storage. If the loss exceeds the stipulated ratio, responsibility must be investigated.

	(2) Regarding the allocation and transfer of public grain, all provinces must obey unified allocation and transfer. After the complete collection of local grain, 5% of the surplus beyond the state-stipulated task must be drawn out and transferred to the local government for handling through unified transfer procedures. Public grain disbursement procedures must go through: 1. The Grain Bureau's disbursement certificate and the provincial grain bureau's (or branch bureau's) allocation voucher issued within the grain quota stipulated by the Grain Bureau. 2. Grain coupons issued by the Grain Bureau. 3. Telegram (or letter) allocation from the Grain Bureau. Other than these, no grain can be disbursed. If the local government has urgent needs, it must report to the Finance Department of the Northeast Political Committee for approval, and the Grain Bureau will issue a disbursement certificate before it can be used. In order to adapt to large-scale transfers, grain should be stored and processed in large quantities in a centralized manner. At each designated grain storage point, a certain amount of prepared processed grain must be regularly processed and stored for immediate disbursement in case of emergency.

	(3) Regarding grain transportation and processing. Grain transportation mainly refers to the transportation from grain depots to processing plants. In order to adapt to the Ministry of Railways' overall transportation plan, the grain bureaus of each province must make a full-year transportation plan for 1949 before the end of November, which will be collected by the Grain Bureau and submitted to the Ministry of Railways. Afterwards, the transportation plan for the next month must be submitted on the 15th of each month. Railway freight uses transportation checks uniformly issued by the Grain Bureau. The processing of public grain requires the use of a large amount of processing industry. In addition to the grain agency's own industry, it is also necessary to use a large part of local public and private processing industry to process grain. In order to control processing production well, increase output, save expenses, and reduce waste, a special agency must be established outside the establishment of the Grain Bureau and the grain bureaus of various provinces to unify management.

	(4) Regarding work reports and reporting system. The summary of this year's grain work must include work business, grain collection and payment report form, grain processing production cost calculation report form, and grain affairs expenditure report form. The general description of grain work business and experience must include statistical materials from all aspects of collection, storage, allocation, processing, and transportation as proof. The above summary report must be sent to the Grain Bureau before the end of this month, and a statistical table of warehouse inventory should be sent every five days thereafter, and a simple comprehensive report of the collection and payment inventory report form and various aspects of work should be sent monthly. The grain inventory statistical table should be as complete as possible. If there are difficulties at the beginning, there is no need to wait for completion before reporting. It should be sent on time as soon as possible to avoid delays and hinder the implementation of the reporting system.

    支援解放全国大规模战争
    东北改善粮食工作
    统一分配调拨改进保管方法
    【新华社哈尔滨八日电】东北行政委员会粮食总局，于上月五日召开东北各省市（热河省及沈阳、长春两市除外）粮食局长会议，讨论保证完成今年征粮工作，以及关于公粮的征收、保管、分拨、运输与加工等各项重要问题。会议历时五日，于九日结束。会议认为：在东北全境解放的新形势下，为了担负支援解放全国的大规模战争的重任，必须提高东北各地粮食工作的效率，使之更加计划化、正规化，以保证军需和产业部门的粮食供应。今年东北各地除须完成征收公粮、交仓入库的任务外，必须总结过去保管公粮的经验，改进保管方法，避免霉烂、浪费。在经常总结工作的过程中，注意培养干部，加强对干部的政策教育、纪律教育及统一集中的思想教育。反对经验主义，改进工作方法，并建立更加健全的各种粮食工作制度。会议对于今后东北的粮食工作，作了以下各项重要的决定：
    （一）对公粮征收与入库保管问题。各省必须确实完成国家规定的征粮任务。农民交纳公粮须运送到指定地点入库，除特殊地区不能运送者，必须由省政府呈报东北政委会批准，才能另行处理。各省粮食局对征粮工作须深入检查、督促，每五天向省政府及粮食总局作一次实征统计报告。粮库在收到公粮时，要经过严格检查质量后，方能装库。从粮食总局到粮库都要对保管负责，若超过耗损的规定比率，一定要追究责任。
    （二）关于公粮分配与调拨问题，各省必须服从统一的分配与调拨。地方粮必须在征收全部完成后，在国家规定任务的多余部分抽出百分之五，经过统一调拨的手续，拨交地方政府处理。公粮支拨手续须经：一、粮食总局支拨证及省粮食局（或分局）在总局规定粮额范围内制发之分拨凭单。二、总局印发之粮票。三、总局电（或函）拨。除此之外，一概不能支粮。地方政府如有紧急需要时，必须报请东北政委会财政部批准，由总局开给支拨证，始能动用。为适应大量调拨，粮食应大量集中保管与集中加工，在每个规定的屯粮点上，必须经常加工与保管一定数量的常备加工粮，以备急需时的随时支出。
    （三）关于粮食运输和加工问题。粮食运输主要是指从粮库转运到加工厂的运输。为适应铁道部总的运输计划，各省粮食局在十一月底以前概须作出一九四九年度全年运输计划，由总局汇齐提到铁道部，往后则每月十五日提交下个月运输计划。铁路运费使用粮总统一签发的运输支票。对公粮之加工，需要使用大量的加工业。在粮食机关自营工业之外，还须利用地方公私营加工业加工很大一部分粮食。为很好掌握加工生产，增加出品，节省开支，减少浪费，必须在粮食总局及各省粮食局编制之外，设立专门的机构来统一管理。
    （四）关于工作报告与报告制度问题。本年度粮食工作总结，须包括工作业务、粮食收付报告表、粮谷加工生产成本计算报告表与粮务经费收支报告表。粮食工作业务在综合说明一般工作与经验教训，其中必须有征收、保管、分配、加工和运输等各方面统计材料以为证明。以上总结报告须于本月底以前造送粮食总局，往后每五日造送一次各仓库库存统计表，每月一次收付库存报帐表和各方面工作的简单综合报告。粮食库存统计表应尽可能完善。在开始时如有困难，则不必等待完备再报，应尽先按时造送，以免耽误时间，妨害报表制度的执行。
