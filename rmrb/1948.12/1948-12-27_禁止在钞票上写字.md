　　Prohibition of Writing on Banknotes
    In recent months, the market has seen many local currency notes with writing and drawings on them. This is detrimental to the credibility of the currency and the identification of genuine notes. Our publicity efforts over the past few months have had some effect, but this still occurs in the market. The public reflects that "the enforcement power of one or two counties is too small, and other counties don't care, so it continues to circulate as usual, and it cannot be completely eliminated."
    We hope that local governments and banks will pay attention, and if this happens again, it should be stopped immediately. We hope to widely publicize this to merchants and the public.

　　禁止在钞票上写字
    近几个月市场发现不少本币，在票面上写字画花。这样对本币的信用及真假识别实为不利。经过我们几个月宣传起了不少作用，但市场仍有此事发生。群众反映说：“一、二个县制止力量太小，别的县没人管，仍照常流通，所以不能彻底肃清。”
    望各地政府银行注意，如再有此事发生，应立即制止。希望同商民群众广泛宣传。
