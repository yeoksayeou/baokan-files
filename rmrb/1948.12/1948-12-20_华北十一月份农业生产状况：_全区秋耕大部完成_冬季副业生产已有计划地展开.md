　　North China Agricultural Production Situation in November:

    Autumn Ploughing Mostly Completed
    Winter Sideline Production Planned and Underway
    [Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] Completing the autumn ploughing, comprehensively carrying out sideline production, and preparing for next year's large-scale production are the central tasks of agricultural production in North China in November.

    Under the slogan of "The land doesn't freeze, the plough doesn't stop," autumn ploughing work has been mostly completed in various regions, and winter ploughing is continuing in a few unfinished areas. In general areas of central Hebei, over 80% of autumn land has been ploughed, exceeding the scale of previous years. In the Taiyue District, 70% to 90% of autumn land had been ploughed by mid-November; in many areas of the Taihang District, ploughing was combined with the autumn harvest, and by late October, most of the autumn land had been ploughed. Counties such as Pingshun have already completed all ploughing, laying the foundation for increased production next year.

    Land Reform Rectification Successfully Completed
  　Farmers Carefully Manage Land
    The main reasons why this year's autumn ploughing could be mostly completed are: objectively, land reform allowed the vast number of poor and tenant farmers to obtain land, and the correction of deviations infringing on middle peasants in some areas this autumn allowed farmers to安心积极 (ānxīn jījí) to actively manage their own land with peace of mind. At the same time, some areas suffered from insect plagues this year, and farmers accepted the painful lessons of the lack of widespread autumn ploughing last year. The main reason is due to timely deployment and organization by the leadership. The central Hebei district used the cadre force leading the autumn harvest and wheat planting to fully shift to mobilizing the masses to carry out autumn ploughing. The Taihang district seized the opportunity to organize the masses to carry out autumn ploughing during the autumn harvest to prevent drought and freezing. In particular, great efforts were made to solve the problem of livestock power shortage, such as specifically solving the equivalent exchange of human and livestock exchange, protecting livestock, and settling last year's wages, breaking the concerns of households with livestock power. Taihang, Beiyue and other places also adopted methods such as human-pulled ploughs and human-dug land to overcome the difficulty of lacking livestock. Cadres patiently opened up the masses' thinking on autumn ploughing, and in general areas, they overcame the formalism under past coercive orders, not simply looking at quantity, but focusing on quality to achieve both deep and even ploughing, using double ploughs where appropriate and single ploughs where appropriate. Last year, some areas, due to coercive orders, the masses were forced to plough, but in reality, they were just ploughed hastily, and did not play the proper role.

    This year's winter production has received great attention from local leaders. A few counties and districts in southern Hebei, etc., initially simply emphasized ending land reform and neglected winter production, but now they have been corrected in time one after another, and various different sideline productions have been carried out according to the different specific conditions of each place. Central Hebei, Taihang and other places have carried out the rectification of cooperatives, and led the mutual aid organizations in the autumn harvest and autumn ploughing to turn to jointly engage in sideline production. Fuping and other places in Beiyue proposed: "Turn winter leisure into busyness, don't eat this autumn's grain this winter," and organized various sideline productions. In Gaoyang, Wuji and other counties in central Hebei, the textile industry, Anping's horse tail Luo industry, Anxin Baiyangdian's mat and fishing industry, Wenxin and other counties' villages' saltpeter industry and other transportation, workshops and other sideline industries have greatly developed. At present, Gaoyang County has more than 4,000 looms weaving cloth, and can produce more than 47,000 bolts of cloth per day. Anping County currently has 56 villages weaving horse tail Luo, with 2,622 machines weaving Luo, and each person can weave 7 Luo bases a day, earning 2,100 yuan in labor costs. The mat industry in Anxin County is a major source of livelihood for the masses. At present, more than 100 villages and more than 100,000 people have solved their livelihood difficulties through weaving mats. The fishermen of Wenanwa and Jiakouwa in central Hebei have prepared their boats and nets, and will immediately cast their nets to catch fish as soon as the ice freezes solid. Many areas of Taihang and Taiyue are engaged in the transportation industry. In Renzhuang, Licheng, Taihang, all 125 households in the village were organized to take turns going out to transport goods. By the end of November, they had earned back 11,000 catties of rice. The village plans to earn back all the public grain levied on the whole family this year within a month. Other local handicrafts, workshops, etc. have also greatly developed, such as the silk weaving industry in Gaoping, Taiyue District, and the small coal and iron industry in central Shanxi District, which are gradually developing.

    Constructing Water Conservancy and Adding Livestock
  　Preparing for Vigorous Production Next Year
    In winter production, the leading ideology clearly put forward that "winter production is to prepare sufficient funds and necessary conditions for next year's large-scale production." Where water conservancy can be built and afforestation can be carried out, preparations for water conservancy construction and afforestation have been carried out. Beiyue, central Hebei and other places are promoting water conservancy promotion cooperatives and restoring the construction of waterwheels and wells to increase paddy fields. The work team dispatched by the Second Water Conservancy Promotion Cooperative in central Hebei, in Licun, Boye, has repaired waterwheels and wells in one month, which can irrigate 800 mu of land. The Beiyue District also advocated using the method of public office assistance to the people to dig and dredge canals. After the completion of the Shimenyu Canal in Wei County, it can irrigate 6,700 mu of land. The North China People's Government and the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Administrative Office have successively dispatched surveying teams to various places to measure river channels, lakes and weirs, and plan to build water conservancy projects to irrigate land and prevent floods. Secondly, afforestation work, the Central Hebei Agricultural and Forestry Department held an afforestation meeting to specifically study the afforestation of sandy wasteland and alkaline land, and decided to improve afforestation technology, effectively protect forests, and vigorously develop cooperative afforestation. Fangshan and other counties also jointly established a joint village forest protection association. The third is to effectively issue agricultural loans, and determine that this year's agricultural loans will be mainly used for building water conservancy, purchasing livestock, and manufacturing agricultural tools. In Jincheng, Taiyue, Guantao, southern Hebei and other places, farmers purchased a large number of livestock. According to statistics from the first, fifth, and sixth districts of Guantao County alone, more than 1,000 livestock were added in 40 days. The fourth is to accumulate a large amount of fertilizer and prepare fuel for next spring. Duang辖 (Duàn xiá) village in Jincheng, Taiyue plans to accumulate 9,400 dan of fertilizer by opening flour mills, collecting manure, accumulating fertilizer, and collecting manure, striving to apply 40 dan of fertilizer per mu next spring (an increase of 5 dan compared to this year). Anle Village, Qinyuan, has accumulated more than 1,000 carts of manure by stepping on sheepfolds, removing cattle sheds, sweeping garbage, and paving road soil. Baibiao Village, Changzi, has now accumulated enough manure to apply 60 dan per mu. As for preparing firewood, Youhuo Village, Qinyuan, 14 people 打柴 (dǎchái) got 16,400 catties of firewood in eight days. Kao Village, Changzi, organized 37 livestock to haul coal, preparing two-thirds of the fuel for next year. Fifth, in order to hunt and kill harmful beasts and mountain birds and increase winter income, the Agricultural Department of the North China People's Government also issued instructions, calling on farmers to carry out the mountain hunting movement to reduce crop disasters next year.

    In the work of preparing for next year's large-scale production, we should strengthen planning. Comrade Zhang Chong, Deputy Minister of Agriculture of the North China People's Government, published a special article in the People's Daily, proposing that we should "strengthen the planning and organization of agricultural production leadership," believing that in the past we were in the war environment of enemy division and destruction, and it was impossible to propose a unified, longer-term plan for the entire region; at the same time, many places were also more general calls, lacking specific plans and organization work. Now the situation is different. The North China Liberated Area has been connected into one piece in the victorious development of the revolutionary war, and has a stable environment; in addition, the completion of land reform in most areas has liberated the productive forces, so it is possible and should strengthen the planning and organization of agricultural production. This spirit has aroused great attention in the winter production work in North China. Southern Hebei District has already issued instructions, requiring all localities to carry out specific rural investigation and research work and formulate next year's agricultural production plan. At the meeting of the local committee and the party group secretary of the special office convened by the Taiyue District Committee last month, it has also formulated next year's agricultural production plan for the entire district, and is preparing in an organized and step-by-step manner to ensure the completion of Chairman Mao's task of "increasing production by one inch."

　　华北十一月份农业生产状况：
    全区秋耕大部完成
    冬季副业生产已有计划地展开
    【本报特讯】完成秋耕、全面进行副业生产及明年大生产的准备，是华北十一月份农业生产的中心任务。
    在“地不冻、犁不停”的口号下，各区秋耕工作都已大部完成，少数未完成的地区并继续进行冬耕。冀中一般地区秋地，已耕完百分之八十以上，规模超过往年。太岳区秋地，至十一月中旬，已耕完百分之七十至九十；太行区不少地区，在秋收中即结合进行，至十月下旬，秋地大部耕完，平顺等县业已全部完成，给明年增产打下了基础。
    土改纠偏胜利完成
  　农民精心经营土地
    今年秋耕能大部完成的主要原因：客观上是土地改革使广大贫雇农得到了土地，及今秋在部分地区纠正了侵犯中农的偏向，使农民都能安心积极地在自己的土地上精心经营。同时今年部分地区遭受了虫灾，农民接受了去年秋耕不普遍的惨痛教训。主要的是由于领导上的及时布置与组织，冀中区以领导秋收种麦的干部力量，全力转入发动群众进行秋耕，太行区抓紧时机，在秋收中即组织群众进行秋耕，以防旱冻。特别是在解决畜力困难问题上，作了很大努力，如具体解决了人畜换工的等价交换、爱护牲畜、清算去年工资等问题，打破了有畜力户的顾虑。太行、北岳等地，并采取了人拉犁、人刨地等 办法，克服了牲畜缺乏的困难。干部耐心打通了群众秋耕思想，一般地区均克服了过去的强迫命令下的形式主义，不单纯的看数量，在质量上而能做到又深又匀，用双犁的双犁、单犁的单犁。去年有些地区由于强迫命令，群众被迫耕了，但实际上只是潦草的耕了耕，没有起到应有的作用。
    今年的冬季生产，各地领导上都极注意，冀南等区个别县区，最初只单纯强调结束土改，忽视冬季生产，现均已先后得到及时的纠正，并均按照各地不同的具体条件，进行各种不同的副业生产，冀中、太行等地均进行了合作社的整顿工作，并领导秋收秋耕中的互助组织转向合伙搞副业生产。北岳阜平等地提出：“冬闲变忙，今冬不吃今秋粮”，组织进行各种副业。在冀中区高阳、无极等县的纺织业，安平的马尾罗业，安新白洋淀的席、鱼业，文新等县部分村庄的硝业及其它运输、作坊等副业，均有极大开展，现高阳全县共有四千余架织布机织布，每日能出布四万七千余匹。安平全县现有五十六个村织马尾罗，有二千六百廿二张机子织罗，每人一天能织七个罗底，能赚手工钱二千一百元。安新县的席业是群众生活源来的大宗，目前有一百余村十万以上的人从编席中解决了生活困难。冀中文安洼、贾口洼的渔民，已将船网准备齐全，一候冰结坚固，立即下网捕鱼。太行、太岳不少地区群众，进行运输业，太行黎城仁庄，全村一百二十五户组织起来，轮流出去搞运输，至十一月底止，已赚回米一万一千斤。该村计划一个月内，即可将全家今年所征的公粮全部赚回。其它各地的手工业、作坊等亦有很大发展，太岳区高平的丝织业，晋中区的小型煤铁业等，均在逐渐发展中。
    兴修水利添置牲口
  　准备明年大力生产
    在冬季生产中，领导思想上明确的提出了“冬季生产是准备明年大生产的足够资金和必须条件”，在能兴修水利与造林的地方，都进行了兴修水利与造林的准备工作。北岳、冀中等地，正在推广水利推进社，恢复水车水井的修建工作，以增加水田。冀中第二水利推进社派出的工作组，在博野李村，一个月来，已修好的水车水井，即能浇地八百亩。北岳区并提倡用民办公助方法，凿疏水渠。蔚县石门峪水渠修竣后，能浇地六千七百亩。华北人民政府及冀鲁豫行政公署，都先后派遣测量队，分赴各地测量河道湖堰，有计划地修建水利，浇地防洪。其次是造林工作，冀中农林处曾召开造林会议，专门研究沙荒地及碱地的造林问题，决定改进造林技术，切实护林，并大力发展合作造林。房山等县并联立了联村护林会。第三是有效地发放农业贷款，确定今年农贷主要用于兴修水利、购买牲口、制造农具等。太岳晋城、冀南馆陶等地，农民大量购置牲口，仅馆陶县一、五、六区统计：四十天中即添购牲口达千余头。第四是大量积肥与准备明春燃料，太岳晋城段辖村，计划用开粉坊、集圈、积肥、拾粪等方法，积肥九千四百担，争取明春每亩上粪四十担（比今年增加五担）。沁源安乐村用踩羊圈、出牛圈、扫垃圾、垫道土等法，已积下粪土一千余车。长子百杓村现已积粪够每亩上六十担之用。至于准备柴火，沁源有货村，十四人八天中就打柴一万六千四百斤。长子靠村组织三十七头牲口拉煤，准备下明年三分之二的燃料。第五，为了捕杀害兽山禽，增加冬季收入，华北人民政府农业部并发出指示，号召农民开展围山打猎运动，减少明年庄稼灾害。
    在准备明年大生产的工作中，应加强计划性，华北人民政府农业部副部长张冲同志特在人民日报上发表专文，提出应“加强农业生产领导的计划性与组织工作”，认为：过去我们是处在敌人的分割破坏的战争环境下，不可能提出全区性的统一的较长期的计划来；同时有许多地方也是一般号召多，缺乏具体的计划与组织工作，现在情况不同了，华北解放区已在革命战争胜利的发展中连成一片，有了稳定的环境；加之绝大部分地区土地改革的完成，解放了生产力，因此有可能、也应该加强农业生产的计划性与组织工作。这一精神，在华北冬季生产工作中已引起很大注意，冀南区早已发出指示，要求各地进行具体的农村调查研究工作，制订明年的农业生产计划。太岳区党委上月召开的地委和专署党组书记会议上，亦已订出了明年全区的农业生产计划，并正进行有组织有步骤地准备，保证毛主席“生产长一寸”的任务的完成。
