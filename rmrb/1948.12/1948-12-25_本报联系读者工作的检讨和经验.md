　　As an important tool for the Party to connect with the masses, this newspaper has paid attention to how to better connect with the masses since its inception. Since July, we have been piloting columns such as "Inquiries and Answers" and "Voices of the Masses," with dedicated personnel responsible for directly contacting the masses. After five months of exploration, it has been proven that this work is very popular among readers and should become one of the important methods for the Party newspaper to connect with the masses. Many readers have reported that after receiving the newspaper every day, they always look for "Inquiries and Answers" first. In order to improve further, we are willing to provide the situation of this work and the problems we feel to the majority of readers, hoping that everyone can put forward more valuable opinions for joint research and discussion.

　　In five months, a total of 1,129 pieces of readers' questions, opinions, and calls for help were received. Among them, 302 pieces were about the end of land reform, class determination, and compensation for middle peasants. About 20 people came to the newspaper office in person to request solutions to their problems, each of them coming three to five times, and many even more than ten times, mostly for issues of reclassifying their status and compensation. From these questions, it can be seen that disputes are the most common and difficult to grasp in class determination, which often leads to deviations. The following are some of the problems: the boundary between rich peasants and well-to-do middle peasants, the length of time and treatment for landlords and rich peasants who have been reformed through labor, families of revolutionary soldiers or revolutionary staff members who rent out land or hire long-term laborers due to lack of labor, whether mental labor counts as main labor, landlords who also run industrial and commercial businesses or capitalists or freelancers, and specific calculations of exploitation, such as domestic labor by shepherds or cooks, or how to calculate those who are both exploited and exploit others. This shows that the correct standards for class determination have not been universally grasped by the masses and the cadres directly leading this work, and the leading organs in various places must pay close attention to checking and correcting various deviations in class determination at any time; it also shows that the masses pay great attention to the Party's policies and what kind of social status and treatment they should obtain under the Party's policies. Some people even traveled long distances with dry food to the newspaper office to request solutions to their problems. Many people, because their problems involved more factors and could not be resolved immediately, often traveled back and forth repeatedly. For example, Li Chouzi and others from a certain county came to the newspaper office as many as ten times, their attitude was earnest and consistent from beginning to end, which shows that the masses have unlimited trust and enthusiasm for the Party newspaper. It also shows that as long as we are not afraid of trouble and truly care about the masses, even if there are difficult problems that are not easy to solve for a while, the masses will not treat us as bureaucrats and will still treat us with enthusiasm. The questions and opinions raised by readers are not only accusations of individual unreasonable events, but also many valuable active demands, such as requesting the government to introduce jobs for dyeing workers and find sales channels for native cloth, or putting forward good criticisms and suggestions on the work, such as criticisms and suggestions on wasting manpower and undemocratic styles such as beating and scolding people by district and village cadres, which have played a considerable role in improving the work after the review and reply of various organs. Readers have also constantly put forward opinions on the newspaper itself, whether in terms of reporting content or printing and distribution, which has greatly helped the improvement of our work.

　　From handling these problems, we have initially experienced the following points: First, we must treat the questions and opinions raised by readers seriously and cautiously, with analysis and distinction. Correct opinions must be supported and persisted in until the right and wrong are clarified and errors are corrected; incorrect opinions or one-sided reflections, after a certain investigation and understanding, if found to be untrue or one-sidedly exaggerated or the attitude is wrong, should be given appropriate criticism or explanation. For example, Chang Guohua from Taoyuan Village, Fifth District, Shijiazhuang City, wrote that his village wrongly struggled against middle peasants without compensation. When the district government's investigation did not match the facts, we immediately gave public criticism. When the masses and the leading organs have different opinions, we adopt an attitude of listening to both sides, investigating and researching, and solving problems in a realistic manner.

　　Second, rely on relevant departments to jointly answer questions from the masses. Many specific issues related to specific laws and regulations, such as corvée labor, substitute cultivation, burdens, and marriage, or specialized knowledge such as medicine, agriculture, and technology, which we cannot answer, are all answered by relevant agencies. After our special letters of appointment and personal contact, government departments have attached great importance to these issues. In particular, the North China Government's cautious and serious handling of mass opinions is worth learning from all over the country: all mass issues are uniformly received and sent by the General Office of the Secretariat, and distributed to various departments according to the nature of the issue. Each department first has the minister read and approve the principles of reply, then assigns a special person to reply, and then the minister reviews the reply before submitting it to the General Office of the Secretariat for unified issuance. In answering questions, it is not just a simple statement of whether or not something should be done according to the laws and regulations, but generally also explains the reasons, so that readers not only know what to do, but also understand why they should do it, so that laws and regulations can be specifically implemented at the grassroots level. Problems that are difficult to solve at the grassroots level, such as the burden of corvée labor on workers, used to be handled differently in various places, causing many disputes. After the government's explanation, there was a unified solution. At the same time, it not only solves problems for grassroots cadres and the masses, but also helps government agencies promote work and interpret laws and regulations.

　　Third, to a certain extent, criticism and self-criticism have been carried out within and outside the Party. It can be seen from the statistics alone that criticisms and suggestions on the work of various places have been continuously published in the newspaper since July, but before October, there were very few reviews and replies from relevant agencies. In the two months of October and November alone, there were 42 reviews and replies from relevant agencies and party committees. However, the attitude of accepting criticism is still different: after listening to the opinions of the masses, many local party committees and organs immediately began to check, sought truth from facts, admitted and corrected mistakes, solved problems, and publicly analyzed the causes of errors in order to correct them; if the situation was different, they defended themselves based on the facts to clarify the right and wrong. For example, on July 30, this newspaper published Li Xuezhong's "Whose Law is it to Sweep Me Out of the House" from Monan Village, Xian County, in the voices of the masses. The Xian County Party Committee not only solved the problem, but also reviewed the mistakes of forced orders in conscription that violated the policy, and the phenomenon of disorganization and indiscipline among cadres. At the same time, it also corrected the discrepancies between the call and the facts. On September 16, Liu Ruiqing's call "There is something wrong with the work in Fujiazhuang, Xian County" was published. In its reply, the Xian County Party Committee analyzed the then over-leftist idea of large-scale distribution and the one-sided view of poor peasants and hired laborers, and clarified ideologically that this was not the mass line but the subjective and arbitrary handling of cadres who were divorced from the masses. The replies of the Huolu County Party Committee and the Fifth District Committee regarding the landlord's encroachment on the fruits already obtained in Gaoqian Village are all examples of comprehensive inspection and in-depth analysis. However, some people admit their mistakes in principle, but seek gaps in the discrepancies of individual specific issues as an excuse to resist criticism. For example, the Fourth District of Jingxing, in response to the masses' criticism of their failure to repair the damaged roads in time, did not check their own failure to fulfill their duties, but argued about the size of the potholes on the road. Some people do not reply to correct criticisms, but defend themselves when the facts are different. Or, although they have made a review, it is forced, and the problem is not solved ideologically, so there is no great benefit in reality. Or, they only explain the objective reasons, and do not find the crux of the problem from the subjective active aspect. There are even more people who take a serious bureaucratic attitude towards the opinions of the masses, ignoring them no matter how many times you come to ask. Or they think that "honest people will not go to the newspaper office," and are dissatisfied with the newspaper's acceptance of mass opinions. Although those who take this incorrect attitude are still in the minority, we must pay attention to overcoming them. At the same time, from this period of work, we also realized that although some places did not pay enough attention to the opinions of the masses at the beginning, as long as we adhere to the truth and repeatedly explain, the other party's attitude will be corrected. For example, the problem of villages around Handan. The Handan County Party Committee did not pay enough attention to the opinions of the masses and the criticism of the Party newspaper for a long time. Later, this newspaper transferred the problem to the Jinnan Third Prefectural Committee, and then after this newspaper publicly urged them to express their attitude, not only did the Jinnan Third Prefectural Committee and the Handan County Committee begin to pay attention to this problem and prepare to seek a solution in the rectification of the Party and the end of land reform, but the Jinnan District Party Committee also instructed party committees at all levels to pay attention to accepting the criticism of the Party newspaper and the opinions of the masses. In handling these problems, we sometimes did not do it properly enough, often simply transferring the opinions to the relevant agencies. When encountering some complex and serious problems, we failed to help clarify the situation and propose solutions for reference. We should pay attention to improving this in future work.

　　From the inspection of the work itself, we have experienced that the following problems must be solved in order to avoid isolation and passivity in the work and to make the work of connecting with the masses better, not only to reflect problems but also to solve them:

　　First, we must first improve the theoretical and policy level of the working comrades. In the past, due to our low theoretical level and our lack of deep understanding of the Party's general line and general policy, we were greatly restricted in answering questions. Often the policy was the policy and the problem was the problem. Although we also explained what should or should not be done according to the policy, we were not good at dissolving the policy into specific thoughts or things, and even less good at clarifying the problem theoretically. That is, we only told the masses what to do, and we were not good at analyzing and explaining why to do it that way. Only by constantly learning can we seek improvement in the future.

　　Second, the work of connecting with the masses must be closely integrated with the work of the entire editorial department in order to avoid isolation. In order to strengthen relations with the masses, we have unified the work of correspondence and the work of connecting with the masses. In this way, we can combine the top-down instructions and reporting guidelines of the Correspondence Section with the bottom-up reflection of the situation of connecting with the masses. On the one hand, we can avoid the subjectivity and generalization of formulating reporting guidelines; on the other hand, we can avoid the isolation, one-sidedness and passivity in connecting with the masses. It is of great help for actively organizing manuscripts, expanding the scope of contact, comprehensively studying the ideological problems and other problems existing among cadres and the masses, and analyzing and identifying the nature and reliability of the problems raised by the masses.

　　Third, expand the scope of contact and strengthen the work of serving the masses. In the past, we have contacted a part of the masses, but it is still far from enough, such as the problems and difficulties in the work and study of cadres. What is the living situation and ideological situation of the workers? What are some of the problems? What are some of the problems in the relationship between public and private enterprises? What are some of the obstacles to improving the operation and management of state-owned enterprises? And in rural areas, schools, young women, etc., we have not deeply established relationships, so there is not much reflection of the situation. We welcome all readers to regard us as a loyal friend, to consult us if they have something to discuss, to study with us if they have problems, and to ask us to help solve any requests and difficulties. And please reflect the situation as much as possible, systematically or piecemeal, in any form, we are very welcome. In the past, our focus was mostly on answering questions, and we did not pay enough attention to reader service. In the future, we are willing to meet everyone's requirements to the best of our ability.

　　This is a new job. In the past, we were exploring and learning. In the future, we will have to continue to explore and learn, but our strength is limited. We must, in the spirit of the whole Party running the newspaper, mobilize the broad masses of readers and party and government agencies in various places to help us do a good job in connecting with the masses, so that the Party newspaper can truly become a bridge for the Party to connect with the masses.

### 本报联系读者工作的检讨和经验

　　本报联系读者工作的检讨和经验
    作为党联系群众的重要工具，本报创刊以来，即注意如何更好地密切联系群众。自七月份起试办“询问与答复”、“群众呼声”等栏，专人负责，直接联系群众。经过五个月的摸索，证明这一工作深受读者欢迎，应该成为党报联系群众的重要方法之一。不少读者反映，每天拿到报纸后，总是先找“询问与答复”看。为了提高一步，我们愿将此项工作情况与所感到的问题提供给广大读者，希望大家能提出更多宝贵意见，共同研究探讨。
    五个月中，共收到读者问题意见及呼声等一一二九件。其中结束土改，划成份及补偿中农等三○二件。亲来报社请求解决问题的约二十余人，每人都来过三五次且有十次以上的，也多为改订成份及补偿问题。从这些问题中可以看出：在划成份中纠纷最多最难掌握，因而常常发生偏差的，有以下几个问题：富农与富裕中农的界限、地主富农劳动变成份的年限及待遇、革命战士或革命职员家中无劳力而出租土地或雇用长工、脑力劳动算不算主要劳动、地主兼营工商业资本家或自由职业者、以及具体计算剥削如羊工或厨师等作家务劳动、或是被剥削同时又剥削人怎样计算等问题。这一方面说明正确的划阶级标准还没有普遍地为群众及直接领导这一工作的干部所掌握，各地领导机关还须十分注意随时检查纠正划成份中的各种偏向；同时也说明群众十分注意党的政策，和自己在党的政策下应该取得什么样的社会地位和待遇。有些群众还长途跋涉带着干粮亲来报社请求解决问题，不少人因问题牵扯较多，不能立即解决时，常是三番五次往返奔走。如某县李丑子等，竟连续来报社十次之多，态度之恳切又始终如一，这说明群众对党报是抱有无限信任和热情。同时也说明，只要我们不怕麻烦，真正关心群众，即使有困难问题一时不易解决，群众也不会把我们当作官僚主义者而仍以热情对待。读者提出的问题与意见，不仅只是对个别不合理事件的控诉，还有很多极可宝贵的积极要求，如要求政府为染色工人介绍职业，为土布找销路等，或对工作提出很好的批评意见，如批评与建议对浪费民力以及区村干部打人骂人等不民主作风的批评，经过了各机关的检讨和答复，对改进工作起了相当作用。对报纸本身，无论是报导内容或印刷发行方面，读者也都不断提出意见，大大的帮助了我们工作的改进。
    从处理这些问题当中，我们初步体验到以下几点经验：一、必须严肃而慎重地、有分析有区别地对待读者提出的问题和意见。正确的意见，一定支持，并坚持到弄清是非、改正错误；不正确的意见，或片面的反映，经过一定的调查了解，发现其不真实或片面夸大或态度错误之后，即给以适当的批评或解释。如石家庄市五区桃园村常国华来信说他村错斗中农未予补偿，经过区政府调查与事实不符时，我们当即给以公开批评等。群众与领导机关有不同意见，我们采取兼听的态度，调查研究，实事求是地解决问题。
    二、依靠有关部门，共同解答群众问题。许多有关具体法令规定的如支差、代耕、负担、婚姻等具体问题，或医药农业技术等专门知识，我们所不能解答的，都请有关机关答复。经过我们专函聘约，并亲自联系，政府各部门对这些问题都非常重视。特别是华北政府对群众意见处理的慎重认真更值得各地学习：所有群众问题，寄去后一律由秘书厅统一收发，按问题性质分发各部。各部则先由部长看过批示答复原则，交专人答复，答复后再由部长审阅，而后交秘书厅统一发出。在答复问题中，不只是简单的根据法令条文说一声该不该，一般都还说明道理，使读者不但知道该怎样做，并且明白为什么要这样做，使得法令法规能具体地贯彻到下面。下面不好解决的问题，如工人支差负担等问题，过去各地做法不同，纠纷很多，经政府说明后，便有了统一解决的办法。同时，也不只为下面干部群众解决问题，还可帮助政府机关推动工作解释法令。
    三、在一定程度上，开展了党内外的批评与自我批评，单从数字统计就可以看出：报纸上从七月开始就不断刊登对各地工作的批评与建议，但十月份以前有关机关检讨答复的却很少，十月十一月两月中有关机关党委检讨答复的就有四十二件。但接受批评的态度还是不同的：不少地方党委机关听取群众意见之后，立即着手检查，实事求是，有错误承认改正，有问题解决，并公开分析错误原因以求改正；情况有出入，则据实申辩，弄清是非。如本报七月三十日在群众呼声中发表了献县陌南村李学忠的“把我扫地出门是谁的法令”，献县县委不但解决了问题，还检讨了在参军中的强迫命令违犯政策的错误，和干部中存在的无组织无纪律现象。同时也纠正了该呼声中与事实有出入的地方。九月十六日又发表了刘瑞庆的呼声：“献县富家庄工作有毛病”，献县县委在答复中，分析了当时过左的大平分思想和片面贫雇观点，并从思想上明确了这不是群众路线而是干部脱离群众的主观包办。获鹿县委和五区委对于高迁村地主侵占已得果实的答复等，都是经过了全面检查和深入分析的范例。但也有的是原则上承认错误，而在个别具体问题的出入上寻求空隙，作为抵抗批评的借口。如井陉四区，对群众批评他们公路被挖毁未及时修复的答复，不检查自己工作未尽职守，却在路上的坑的大小尺寸上作分辩。也有的是批评的对了不答复，与事实有出入就申辩。或者是虽做了检讨，但是被迫的，不从思想上解决问题，实际上也就无大补益。或者是只说明客观原因，不从主观能动方面找出问题症结。甚至更有对群众意见采取严重的官僚主义态度，任你三番五次来问，他却始终置之不理。或者认为“是老实群众就不会去找报社”，而对报纸接受群众意见不满意。虽然采取这种不正确态度的还是少数，但必须引起大家注意克服。同时从这一段工作中还体验到，有些地方虽然开初对群众意见不够重视，但只要我们坚持真理，反复说明，对方态度即会端正起来。如邯郸周围村庄的问题，邯郸县委对群众意见和党报批评，长时间未很好注意，后本报将问题转给冀南三地委，又后经本报公开催促请他们表明态度后，不但冀南三地委和邯郸县委对此问题开始重视，准备在整党与结束土改中求得解决，冀南区党委也为此指示各级党委注意接受党报批评和群众意见。我们在处理这些问题中，有时也不够妥善，常是只单纯将意见转给有关机关，遇有某些情况复杂严重的问题，未能很好帮助弄清情况提出解决办法，以供参考，在以后的工作中当注意改进。
    从工作本身检查，我们体验到必须解决以下几个问题，才能避免工作中的孤立被动，使联系群众工作做得更好，不但反映问题而且能解决问题：
    一、首先必须提高工作同志的理论政策水平。过去由于我们理论水平不高，对于党的总路线总方针体会得不深刻，致使答复问题中受到很大限制，常常政策是政策，问题是问题，虽然我们也说明了按照政策该怎么办或不该怎么办，但不善于把政策溶化在具体的思想或事物中，更不善于把问题从理论上给以阐明，也就是只会告诉群众该那么做，不善于分析解释为什么要那样做，只有以后在不断学习中求得提高。
    二、必须使联系群众的工作和整个编辑部门的工作紧密结合，才能避免孤立。为了密切与群众关系，我们已将通联工作与联系群众工作统一起来，这样可以使通联科的自上而下的指示报导方针与联系群众自下而上的反映情况结合起来，一方面可以避免制订报导方针的主观和一般化；一方面避免联系群众中的孤立片面和被动。对于主动地组织稿件，扩大联系范围，比较全面地研究干部群众中所存在的思想问题和其他问题，及分析鉴别群众所提问题的性质及可靠程度等都有很大帮助。
    三、扩大联系范围，加强对群众服务的工作。过去我们已经联系了一部分群众，但还很不够，比如干部工作学习中的问题和困难。工人们的生活情况和思想情况如何？有些什么问题？公私企业关系上有些什么问题？公营企业改进经营管理有些什么障碍？以及农村中，学校中，青年妇女等，我们都还没有深入地建立关系，因之反映情况就不多。我们欢迎所有的读者都能把我们当成一个忠诚的朋友，有事情找我们商量，有问题找我们研究，有什么要求和困难也找我们帮助解决。并多多反映情况，系统的零碎的，任何一种形式的，我们都十分欢迎。过去，我们的重点多放在解答问题方面，对于读者服务是注意得不够的，今后愿就力之所及，满足大家要求。
    这是一件新工作，过去我们在摸索学习，今后也还得不断摸索学习，但我们的力量是有限的，必须广大读者和各地党政机关，本全党办报的精神，大家动手，帮助我们把联系群众的工作做好，使党报真正成为党联系群众的桥梁。
