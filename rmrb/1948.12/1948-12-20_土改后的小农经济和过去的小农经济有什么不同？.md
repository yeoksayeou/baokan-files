　　What are the differences between the small-scale peasant economy after land reform and the previous small-scale peasant economy?
    Question: What is a small-scale peasant economy? Why does the small-scale peasant economy still exist in rural areas after land reform? What are the differences between this small-scale peasant economy and the small-scale peasant economy before land reform? (Hu Datong)
    Answer: To explain the small-scale peasant economy, we must first talk about the development of the rural economy in China. More than a hundred years ago, before the forces of imperialism invaded China, the rural economy at that time was entirely a rural economy of feudal society, mainly a self-sufficient individual economy. The grain grown by the peasants, in addition to paying rent to the landlords, was mainly for their own families to eat. However, after imperialism invaded China, cheap industrial products were shipped to China in large quantities, and the peasants had to take their grain to the streets to sell and then buy various daily necessities. This further destroyed the self-sufficient economy of the countryside, turning agricultural products (grain, etc.) into commodities. Imperialism plundered from it, and at the same time, compradors, feudal bullies, and warlords became bridges for imperialism to plunder the Chinese countryside. The peasants were still bound to small pieces of land, engaging in scattered and backward agricultural production. This was the small-scale peasant economy of the semi-colonial and semi-feudal society. The characteristic of this small-scale peasant economy was that a large amount of land was concentrated in the hands of a few large landlords, and small pieces of land were rented to peasants for cultivation. Under the oppression of foreign imperialism and domestic feudal forces and bureaucratic capitalism, the peasants became increasingly poor, resulting in only a decrease in rural productivity, not an increase. Therefore, the semi-colonial and semi-feudal small-scale peasant economy was also the reason for the backwardness of the Chinese countryside.
    After the implementation of land reform in the liberated areas, fundamental changes took place in the countryside—the peasants obtained land; however, the rural economy basically did not exceed the scope of the individual economy, that is, the peasants cultivated on their own land, and what they grew belonged to them. Although it is necessary to greatly develop labor exchange and mutual assistance and cooperatives, etc., this is still labor mutual assistance based on the principle of voluntary and equal value on the basis of the individual economy, so it is still called a small-scale peasant economy. However, it is essentially different from the semi-colonial and semi-feudal small-scale peasant economy. One is a small-scale peasant economy under the oppression of feudalism, imperialism, and bureaucratic capitalism, heading towards rural bankruptcy day by day; the other is a new democratic small-scale peasant economy in which liberated peasants freely cultivate on their own land, carry out mutual assistance and cooperation on the individual economy, and actively develop productivity.

　　土改后的小农经济和过去的小农经济有什么不同？
    问：什么叫做小农经济？为什么土改以后，农村中还存在着小农经济？这种小农经济和土改以前的小农经济有什么不同？（胡大同）
    答：要解释小农经济，先要说一说中国农村经济发展的情形。在一百多年以前，帝国主义势力还没有侵入中国，那时的农村经济完全是封建社会的农村经济，主要是自给自足的个体经济，农民种出来的粮食除了给地主交租以外，余下的主要给自己的家庭吃用。但在帝国主义侵入中国以后，价钱便宜的工业品大批运到中国，农民不得不把粮食拿到街上去出卖，再去买进各种日用品。这样就更加破坏了农村自给自足的经济，使农产品（粮食等）变成了商品，帝国主义就从中抢掠，同时买办、封建恶霸、军阀，成为帝国主义抢劫中国农村的桥梁，农民仍旧被束缚在小块土地上，分散的落后的经营着农业生产。这便是半殖民地半封建社会的小农经济。这种小农经济的特点便是土地大量集中在少数大地主手里，一小块一小块地分租给农民耕种。农民在国外帝国主义与国内封建势力和官僚资本主义的压迫下越加穷苦，使农村生产力只有减低，没有提高。因此半殖民地半封建的小农经济也是中国农村落后的原因。
    解放区实行土改以后，农村起了根本的变化——农民得到了土地；但是农村经济基本上还没有超过个体经济的范围，就是农民在自己的土地上进行耕种，种出来的东西归自己所有，虽然要大大发展换工互助及合作社等，但这还是在个体经济基础上的实行自愿与等价原则的劳动互助，因此仍旧叫做小农经济。但和半殖民地半封建的小农经济已有本质上的不同。一个是在封建主义、帝国主义与官僚资本主义压迫下的，一天天走向农村破产的小农经济；一个是解放了的农民在自己土地上自由耕种，在个体经济上实行互助合作，积极发展生产力的新民主主义的小农经济。关于这一问题的详细解释，新华社信箱“农业社会主义问答”里已经提到，请参考那个文件。　　　（转载华中新华日报）
