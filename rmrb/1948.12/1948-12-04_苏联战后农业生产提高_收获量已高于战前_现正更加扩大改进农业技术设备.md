Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 29th - TASS reports: The Soviet countryside, after a year of abundant harvests, is now concluding its agricultural work. The northern farmlands are covered in white snow, Ukraine has completed its harvesting, only Central Asia is picking cotton, and Transcaucasia is storing citrus fruits. This year, agriculture has achieved significant successes. Although the total cultivated area has not yet caught up to pre-war levels, the grain harvest of collective farms and state farms is already higher than the pre-war year of 1940. The three granaries of Ukraine, North Caucasus, and Siberia alone harvested 41 million centners (each centner equals 100 catties) more grain than last year. The main agricultural areas completed their grain delivery plans ahead of schedule and over-fulfilled the plans by delivering large amounts of grain. The abundant agricultural harvest, in addition to fully meeting the needs of the people, has also increased the state's grain reserves. All these achievements are the result of the progressive system of agricultural collectivization and the patriotic efforts of collective farmers, especially the socialist emulation to improve agriculture after the war. Beet harvesting was completed earlier than last year; and the storage of potatoes and vegetables has been effectively completed, and the prerequisites for further increasing crop yields are already in place. The total area of cultivated land for summer crops has increased by 15 million hectares compared to last year. Important measures are now being implemented to further expand and strengthen agricultural technology and equipment; the government is supplying the countryside with three times the number of tractors and twice the amount of other agricultural machinery compared to the pre-war year of 1940. Livestock breeding on collective farms has also been greatly improved. As of September 1, the total number of livestock had increased by 22 percent compared to last year. The number of livestock owned by individual collective farmers has also increased. As a result, the amount of livestock products delivered by collective farms to the government this year has greatly increased. The collective farms of the Kazakh Republic alone delivered 25,000 centners more butter than in 1947. In Ukraine, collective farms' butter production this year has reached the 1950 target, producing 172,000 centners more than in 1940. News of early delivery of livestock products has also come from many other regions.

### 苏联战后农业生产提高　收获量已高于战前  现正更加扩大改进农业技术设备

　　苏联战后农业生产提高
  　收获量已高于战前
    现正更加扩大改进农业技术设备
    【新华社陕北二十九日电】塔斯社讯：丰收后的苏联的乡村现正结束一年的农事。北部的农田已铺上白雪，乌克兰已完成收割，只有中亚细亚正进行摘棉，外高加索正在储存柑橘果品。今年，农业获得了显著的成就。尽管耕耘的总面积仍未赶上战前，但集体农场与国家农场的谷物收获量已高于战前的一九四○年。仅乌克兰、北高加索及西伯利亚这三个谷仓，就比去年多收获四千一百万生丁纳（每生丁纳合一百市斤）的谷物。主要的农业地区，早就先期完成纳粮计划，并超过计划缴纳大量的谷物。农业丰收除了充分供应人民的需要外，并使国家储粮增加。这一切成就，都是进步的农业集体化制度和集体农民们爱国努力，特别是战后提高农业的社会主义竞赛的结果。甜菜的收掘比去年完成得早；而洋芋与菜蔬的储存已有效地完成，进一步增加作物产量的先决条件已经具备。夏季作物的耕地总面积，比去年增加了一千五百万公顷。现正实行更加扩大与加强农业技术设备的重要措施；政府正以三倍于战前一九四○年的拖拉机和两倍的其他农业机械供应农村。集体农场的牲畜饲养也大为改进。迄九月一日止，牲畜的总数比去年增加百分之二十二。属于集体农民个人所有的牲畜也同样增加。因此，集体农场今年向政府所缴纳的牲畜产物已大大增加。仅哈萨克共和国的集体农场，即比一九四七年多缴二万五千生丁纳的牛油。在乌克兰，集体农场今年的牛油生产已达一九五○年的目标，比一九四○年多生产十七万二千生丁纳。其他许多地区也传来先期缴交牲畜产物的消息。
