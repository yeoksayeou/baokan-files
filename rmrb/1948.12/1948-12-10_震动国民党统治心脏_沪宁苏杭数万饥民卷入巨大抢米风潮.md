　　Shakes the Heart of Kuomintang Rule
　　Tens of Thousands of Starving People in Shanghai, Nanjing, Suzhou, and Hangzhou Involved in Huge Rice-Seizing Tide
　　【Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 5th】Comprehensive reports from newspapers in Tianjin and Beijing and foreign news agencies: The unprecedented rice-seizing tide that erupted in early November in Shanghai, the economic center of the Kuomintang-controlled area, and Nanjing, the Kuomintang capital, has greatly shaken the heart of the Kuomintang bandit gang's rule. The rice-seizing tide in Shanghai lasted for six consecutive days, from the 4th to the 10th. According to existing, highly incomplete statistics, nearly a hundred rice-seizing incidents occurred in those six days, involving at least 20,000 people. The rice-seizing tide in Nanjing lasted for two days, starting on the 9th. According to Agence France-Presse, more than a hundred rice shops were looted in Nanjing on the 10th alone. According to the Associated Press, twenty or more rice shops were looted in Nanjing on the morning of the 10th, with an average of 500 people seizing rice in front of each shop. The citizens of Nanjing and Shanghai involved in this rice-seizing tide came from many social strata, including factory workers, rickshaw pullers, urban poor, refugees, the elderly, children, women, and even police officers. This was the largest rice riot in the past two or three years.
　　This rice-seizing tide in Nanjing and Shanghai was caused by the Kuomintang government's implementation of "currency reform." In early November, in Shanghai, not only the poor citizens but also many government agencies and schools were unable to buy rice and were on the verge of starvation. For example, all 2,800 teachers and students of Tongji University ate sweet potato porridge for three days from November 5th to 7th. During those three days, the entire university mobilized to buy rice and sweet potatoes, but they could not buy any. In front of every rice shop in Shanghai, there was a long queue of people waiting to buy rice, but very few were able to buy any. On November 5th, more than 40,000 people gathered in front of the Xiahai Temple in the Tiilanqiao district to buy the two dou of rationed rice for October. Old and young, men and women, pregnant women and people nearing seventy years old, all came to "squeeze for rice." Some waited there late into the night. But in the end, except for a very few, more than 30,000 people did not buy a single grain of rice, and the residents were extremely angry. When all hope of buying rice was lost, a large-scale rice-seizing riot broke out.
　　On the morning of the 4th, rice-seizing incidents had already occurred on Limaru Road in Shanghai. By the 6th, 46 rice shops had been looted in Xujiahui alone (according to the Tianjin Minguo Daily of November 7th), and two police officers participated in the looting. On the 8th, 9th, and 13th, the turmoil reached its climax, with the number of people seizing rice often reaching two or three thousand. The focus shifted from seizing grain to seizing food. Starving people, driven mad by hunger, seized anything they could eat, from rice shops to restaurants, tofu shops, and even households with rice stores. Even vegetables, broad beans, and rice bran became targets.
　　The rice-seizing tide in Nanjing began on November 6th. A flour truck of the puppet Legislative Yuan was completely looted by more than a hundred citizens. On the 9th, rice was no longer available in the market, and grain merchants refused to accept gold yuan, requiring gold, silver, or cloth in exchange for a small amount of grain. As a result, the rice-seizing tide expanded. On that day, rice shops on Shigulu Road, Hubei Road, Zhujiang Road, Taiping Road, Jianguo Road, Yaxi Road, outside Zhonghua Gate, and other places were looted. In front of the Yufeng Rice Shop on Shigulu Road, police fired to suppress the crowd, arousing the anger of the starving people, who set the rice shop on fire. On the 10th, the turmoil escalated, and from morning to night, almost all the rice shops were looted by starving people. One rice-seizing citizen claimed that he had not tasted a single grain of rice for three days. Police fired to suppress the crowd, causing chaos, and in front of the Yongtai Rice Shop on Xiexian Road, two people were trampled to death. Some rice shop owners, in response to the demands of the starving people, gave each person a jin of bran to avoid being looted. The Jinlan Biscuit Company and Guanshengyuan Food Company on Baixia Road were both looted, and all the cured salted ducks in a duck shop in Xiaguan were snatched away. More than 10,000 people squeezed into the Jinlan Biscuit Company to seize food, and three people were trampled to death (according to a special dispatch from the Tianjin Yishi Daily in Nanjing). On the evening of this day, when the rice-seizing tide reached its climax, the panic-stricken Kuomintang government immediately declared martial law in Nanjing.
　　【Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 6th】According to the Tianjin Kuomintang Xinxing Daily and Ta Kung Pao: Suzhou and Hangzhou, known as the "paradise on earth" in Jiangnan, and Wuhu, the "rice market" of Jiangnan, were swept by a buying panic in late October and early November caused by the flood of counterfeit gold yuan and violent "price controls," reducing the people to a state of having no clothes or food, and the dead having no coffins for burial.
　　As soon as the buying panic in Suzhou started, rice shops and flour shops closed one after another, and sweet potatoes became a target for panic buying. The fury of hunger forced the starving people who could not buy flour to smash the flour distribution point. In the city, all the restaurants, big and small, would hang up a sign after 12 o'clock saying, "No more service this afternoon, please come early tomorrow." Rickshaw pullers could not find anything to eat and were too weak to pull their carts. The once bustling Guanqian Street in Suzhou seemed unusually desolate. Several large silk shops looked as if they had been looted, with empty shelves and only one or two pieces of faded fabric displayed in the dim windows. Due to the shortage of coal, the electricity was often cut off, and the shops closed their doors at 7 p.m. The deserted streets were so quiet that even the sound of hawkers knocking on their "du-du boards" could not be heard.
　　Everywhere in Hangzhou, one could see long queues. Residents lined up for two or three hours to squeeze in to buy two sheng of yellow coarse rice. It was considered lucky to buy any. Otherwise, they had to go to the black market to buy rice at 6 jiao per sheng, which was more than twice the rationed price. In the commercial district of Qinghefang Street and New Market, the windows of many large shops were empty. In the late autumn season, some shops only displayed some summer goods and old items to decorate the storefront. Some shops put up signs saying "Closed for family reasons," simply shutting their doors. The cheap coffins of the Siming Public Welfare Organization were also snapped up, and to buy a coffin, one had to pay dozens of times the price to dig up and buy a family's stored life-prolonging coffins. Every day after 1 p.m., all the hotels, restaurants, and tea houses that served food were closed, and late-arriving travelers would go hungry. Hotels were ordered to limit the length of stay, and after five days, the hotels would evict guests. The West Lake, which used to be full of tourists, was now desolate. The pleasure boats were moored at the docks, and no one cared about them. The monks and nuns in the famous temples and ancient temples had no scriptures to chant, and they were also worried about firewood, rice, oil, and salt all day long.
　　In Wuhu, due to soaring grain prices and a shortage of rice in the market, more than a thousand male and female citizens of the city petitioned the Kuomintang County Government on November 8th.

　　震动国民党统治心脏
  　沪宁苏杭数万饥民卷入巨大抢米风潮
    【新华社陕北五日电】综合平津报纸及外国通讯社消息：十一月上旬在国民党统治区经济中心上海和国民党首都南京所爆发的规模空前的抢米风潮，给国民党匪帮统治心脏以极大震动。上海抢米风潮从四日至十日，连续六天之久。仅据现有极不完全材料统计，六天中共发生抢米事件近百起，抢米人数至少在两万人以上。南京抢米风潮于九日起持续两日。据法新社消息称：十日一天中南京即有百家以上米店被抢。合众社消息称：十日晨南京米店被抢二十余家，平均每店前抢米人数达五百人。卷入此次抢米风潮之京沪市民，遍及许多阶层，其中包括工厂工人、人力车夫、城市贫民、难民、老人、小孩、妇女，以至警察。为过去两三年来所未见的规模最大的一次米骚动。
    这次京沪抢米风潮，是国民党政府实施“改革币制”所引起的。十一月初，在上海，不但一般贫苦市民，即许多机关学校，因买不到米，也处于断炊状态。例如同济大学全校师生二千八百余人，自十一月五日至七日吃了三天红薯稀饭。三天中全校师生动员四出买米、买红薯，皆未买到。上海每家米店门前都是购米的长蛇阵，但很少人能买到米。十一月五日提篮桥区居民为了争购十月份的两斗户口米，配售户口米的下海庙门前一下子聚集了四万多人，老小男女，孕妇和年近古稀的老人，都来“挤米”。有的深夜就候在那里。但结果除了极少数的人以外，三万多人都是一粒米未购到，居民们愤怒到极点。当购得米的一切希望都破灭的时候，大规模的抢米骚动便随之发生了。
    四日晨上海里马路即已发生抢米事件。至六日，徐家汇一地即已有四十六家米店被抢（十一月七日天津民国日报载），并有两警察参加抢米。至八、九、十三天，骚动达高潮，抢米人数动辄两三千人，并从抢粮食发展到抢食物。饿火中烧的饥民们见可吃的东西就抢，从米店到饭馆、豆腐店以及有存米的住户，甚至青菜、蚕豆、米糠，都成为抢的对象。
    南京抢米风潮开始于十一月六日，伪立法院面粉车，被百余市民一抢而光。九日食米已无市，粮商拒收金圆券，须以金银纱布始能换得少量粮食。因之抢米风潮扩大。该日石鼓路、湖北路、珠江路、太平路、建国路、雅西路、中华门外等地米店皆被抢。石鼓路裕丰米店前，因警察鸣枪镇压，激起饥民愤怒，将米店放火烧毁。十日风潮更形扩大，从清晨到夜晚，几乎所有的米店都遭饥民抢劫。一抢米饥民称他已三天没尝到粒米。警察鸣枪镇压，秩序混乱，斜巷永泰米店前，二人被踏死。部分米店老板答应饥民要求，每人送糠一斤，始免被抢。白下路的金兰饼干公司和冠生园食品公司皆被抢，下关一家板鸭店，所有的生腌板鸭全被抢光了。挤到金兰饼干公司抢食品的达万余人，三人被踏死（据天津益世报南京专电）。在抢米风潮发展到最高潮的这一天晚间，惊惶失措的国民党政府即宣布南京戒严。
    【新华社陕北六日电】天津国民党新星报及大公报消息：被称为江南锦绣之地的苏州与杭州和江南“米市”芜湖，于十月下旬和十一月上旬被伪金圆券泛滥与暴力“限价”所引起的抢购风潮横扫后，弄到活人无衣无食，死人没有棺材装殓的地步。
    苏州抢购风潮一起，米店和面粉铺即相继关门，山芋也成为抢购的对象了。饥饿的怒火逼得挤购不着面粉的饥民们捣毁了面粉配售处。城内大小饭馆每天十二时一过，就挂起“下午无市，明日请早”的牌子。人力车夫因为买不着东西吃，以致无力拉车。苏州最热闹的观前街显得异常萧条，几家大绸缎庄象被洗劫过一样，货架空空，只在低暗的橱窗里摆着一两段褪了色的料子。由于煤斤的缺乏，电灯时常停电，各商店下午七时就关上铺门，冷清清的路上连敲“笃笃板”的小贩声都听不见。
    杭州城内到处可见的是一字长蛇阵。居民们站队等候两三小时去挤购两升黄糙米，能买到就算运气好，否则只有到黑市去购六角钱一升的米，黑市米比配售价高出两倍多。商业闹区清和坊大街和新市场，许多大商店的橱窗都空空如也。深秋季节，有些商店只放着一些夏季用品和破旧的物品敷衍门面。有些商店贴上“家中有事，暂停营业”的条子，干脆关了门。慈善机关四明公所的平价棺材也被抢购一空，要买棺材只有出几十倍的价钱去挖购家藏的寿材。每天下午一点，凡是可吃的酒店、饭馆、茶店，统统关门，晚到的旅客就要饿肚子。旅馆受令限制旅馆住期，过了五天，旅馆就要下逐客令。平日游客甚多的西子湖畔，现在已是一片凄凉。画舫停在码头无人过问，名寺古刹的和尚尼姑也没有经忏可念了，他们也在一天到晚为柴米油盐发愁。
    芜湖，由于粮价飞涨，市面断米，该市男女市民千余人曾为此于十一月八日至国民党县府请愿。
