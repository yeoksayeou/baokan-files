　　Nongyuan Yincheng Veterinary Station
  　One Month Cures Over a Hundred Livestock

    [Taihang News] The Yincheng Veterinary Education Work Station of the North China University Agricultural College cured a total of 153 livestock in November, resolving many difficulties for the masses in transportation and production. After the autumn harvest, farmers turned to winter transportation and production. In addition, with the recent transport of public grain, there are many vehicles and horses traveling to and from Changzhi and Yincheng every day, and various livestock are constantly falling ill on the road. In order to maintain the strength of livestock, promote winter production, and accelerate the transport of public grain, the station offers free acupuncture and actively treats illnesses. Statistics for November alone show that 153 livestock were cured, with serious illnesses accounting for one-third of the total. In addition to treating livestock on the road in the town, the station also organized a medical team to visit nearby villages to treat livestock diseases, which was very welcomed by the masses. Recently, the masses in Donghuo Village have also requested the establishment of a veterinary station in their village. (Wang Kongwen)

　　农院荫城兽医站
  　一月治好牲口百余头
    【太行讯】华大农学院荫城兽医教育工作站，十一月份共治好牲口一百五十三头，解决了群众运输生产中不少困难。秋耕以后，农民即转上冬季运输生产，加以最近运送公粮，长治荫城这条路上，每日来往车马很多，各种牲口不断有半路生病的。该站为了保持畜力健壮，开展冬季生产，加速运送公粮，特免费针灸，积极医治，只十一月份一个月统计，即治好牲口一百五十三头，其中重病占三分之一。该站除在本镇医治路上牲口外，还组织了一个医疗小组，到附近村庄看牲口病，群众十分欢迎。最近东火村群众并要求前往该村设立兽医站。（王孔文）
