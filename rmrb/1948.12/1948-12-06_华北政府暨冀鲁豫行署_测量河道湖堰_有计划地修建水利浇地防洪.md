  　Measure River Channels and Lake Embankments
  　To Systematically Build Water Conservancy Projects for Irrigation and Flood Control
    [By Our Newspaper] To construct water conservancy projects, the North China People's Government and the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Administrative Office have successively dispatched survey teams to various regions to conduct surveys of river channels and lake embankments. The Beiyue Fushan Water Conservancy project originates from the Sanggan River. A dam is built near Luozhuang in Shanyin to block the river. This is one of the seven major damming projects in the fundamental plan for harnessing the Shui River. It combines flood control and irrigation, so a canal is dug on the south bank of the river to divert water. Last year, the Jin-Sui Border Region built branch canal gates, increasing the benefited area from hundreds of hectares to more than three hundred hectares. However, due to loose canal walls and obstructed canal lines, the water flow was not very smooth. The North China Government, considering that the irrigated area of the water conservancy project covers over forty villages in Shanyin County and sixty villages in Ying County, with a land area of more than six thousand hectares, decided to renovate it. In mid-November, it dispatched a survey team of eighteen people and seven trainees to conduct surveys. The survey team has now completed the measurement of the entire southern trunk canal and is currently dividing into groups for calculations. After drawing the maps, it will proceed with the measurement of branch canals and formulate a renovation plan.

    In the Hebei-Shandong-Henan area, except for the Yellow River, the river dikes and lake embankments of other rivers have not been repaired for many years, and the riverbeds are mostly silted up and impassable. In recent years, due to excessive rainfall, overflows often occur, and low-lying areas become flooded. This spring, various regions carried out some river management work. During the autumn harvest and wheat planting season, the disaster-stricken areas, under the leadership and organization of the government, formed a mass movement to dig ditches and drain water, which achieved considerable results. However, for the entire region, due to the lack of concrete plans and strict organization and leadership, the flood damage this year was still more severe than in previous years. South of the Yellow River and in the four special districts of Hebei, due to the disturbances of the Kuomintang bandit troops, the water in some areas has not yet been drained. The Hebei-Shandong-Henan Administrative Office specially dispatched a survey team in mid-November, carrying leveling instruments, to the areas south of the Yellow River and the four and eight special districts north of the Yellow River to conduct disaster area surveys and understand the situation. It plans to formulate a comprehensive river management plan by December 10, based on the survey and understanding obtained.

　　华北政府暨冀鲁豫行署
  　测量河道湖堰
  　有计划地修建水利浇地防洪
    【本报讯】为修建水利事业，华北人民政府及冀鲁豫行政公署，都先后派遣测量队，分赴各地，进行河道湖堰堪测。北岳富山水利，源接桑干河，于山阴罗庄附近拦河筑坝，为水定河治本计划七大拦坝之一，防洪灌溉结合为一，遂于河南岸开渠引水。晋绥边区于去年修筑支渠闸，受益面积由百顷地亩增至三百多顷，但因渠洛松弛，渠线不通，水流不很畅顺。华北政府鉴于该水利淤灌面积辖域计山阴四十余村，应县六十余村，地亩达六千余顷，遂决定整修，已于上月中旬派遣测量队一行十八人，练习生七人，进行测量。该测量队现已将南干线渠全部测量完竣，正在分组计算，绘图后，进行支干渠测量，并拟订整修计划。

    冀鲁豫区除黄河以外，其余河堤湖堰，多年未修河身，大部淤塞不通，近年雨水过大，时常漫溢外流，低洼之处，即积水成灾。今春各地曾进行若干治河工作，秋收种麦时期，被灾地区，经政府领导组织，形成群众性的挖沟疏水运动，都获得了相当成绩，但就全区来说，由于缺乏具体计划，与严密组织领导，致使今年所受水灾仍较往年为重。黄河以南及河北四专区，更由于国民党匪军扰害，其部分地区积水仍未排出。冀鲁豫行署特于本月中旬派遣测量队，携带水平仪器，分赴黄河以南地区及黄河以北四八专区，进行灾区勘测，了解情况。拟于十二月十日前，根据勘测了解所得，订出全面的治河计划。
