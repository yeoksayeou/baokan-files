　　Cadres in North China Intensify Theoretical and Policy Studies
　　Re-deployment is Now Underway Based on the North China Bureau's Decision on On-the-Job Cadre Study
　　[This Newspaper Despatch] In the past two months, the study of cadres in North China's agencies has made significant progress. The tendency of empiricism in thought and the phenomenon of anarchism and indiscipline in organization are being actively overcome, with the correct grasp of policies and the study of theory as the center. The deployments in various places include "Summary of the Second Year and Tasks of the Third Year of the People's Liberation War," "Questions and Answers on Agricultural Socialism," and the Intelligence Bureau and the CCP Central Committee's "Resolution on the South Communist Problem." Cadres in Yangquan and other cities are studying industrial and commercial policies and labor policies. Generally, work has been reviewed based on documents.

　　In conjunction with reviewing anarchism and indiscipline in work, the studies in various places have achieved significant results in establishing systems, especially the system of requesting instructions and reporting. Various places have examined and concluded that the failure to request instructions and report is, organizationally speaking, anarchism and indiscipline, and ideologically speaking, it is their own empiricism in work, not attaching importance to the role of leadership, and mistakenly regarding requesting instructions and reporting as "formalism" and a "burden," without understanding that writing reports requires in-depth understanding of the situation, using thought to analyze problems, and summarize experience, which is an effective way to improve one's own political and ideological level.

　　The leaders in various places have also begun to recognize the importance of theoretical study. Since September, various places have held continuous cadre study tests. The results of the tests show that many comrades' understanding of the nature of the New Democratic Revolution and the Party's general policy and general line is vague, or fragmented and incomplete. Some have forgotten to oppose feudalism, some have forgotten to oppose bureaucratic capitalism, and some have even directly answered "now is the communist revolution." Some county party secretaries in Central Hebei answered the composition of the New Democratic economy as "capitalist economy and socialist economy." This shows that the theoretical foundation of our cadres is very weak.

　　Due to the fact that policy studies were not closely linked to the basic theory of Marxism-Leninism and the study of the Party's general line and general policy, and the study method had the problem of empiricism, ideological improvement was not sufficient. Some comrades always felt that they did not have a good grasp of policies. In response to this situation, Taiyue deployed the study of "On New Democracy" and "The Communist Manifesto," and Yangquan deployed the study of "Social Development History" and "Political Economy," all of which were beneficial.

　　Using tests to promote learning has been fully proven to be effective. Xin Shen County and other places in Central Hebei have held two or three tests in a row. After the tests in Wu'an and Renqiu Counties in Taihang, and other counties in Central Hebei, the answers to the questions were published. Guan County even criticized the wrong answers. After such tests, some comrades said: "We have been making revolution for so many years, but we don't even understand the revolutionary line. It's too dangerous." Many people were determined and said: "This time doesn't count, we'll see you next time." Some launched debates on the dining table; some copied the answers to the questions in their notebooks; some seriously studied the questions as soon as it was time to study. Junan and other places seized the opportunity, and immediately reviewed the past studies after the test, specifically studied the future plans, and set the test as a system. These experiences prove that holding tests is an effective way to promote learning. However, some places are testing for the sake of testing, simply to stimulate, without preparation beforehand, a sudden blitz, making everyone very panicked, or even avoiding it, or asking someone to write it for them, "You can write whatever you want, I have no opinion." After the test, there is no evaluation or summary, which should be improved.

　　Although the leadership in various places has paid more attention to study than before, the responsible cadres in many places are still not determined enough. According to a survey of 15 county party committees in Central Hebei, only one-third to one-half of them can persist in studying every month. Most of them are too busy with work, simply urging others, and neglecting their own studies. In addition, a large number of district-level cadres still lack reading materials and teaching materials, and lack help. Some people talk for everyone to listen; some one-sided collective studies cannot go deep, those with high levels feel restrained and cannot improve; those with low levels also feel distressed, unable to understand or interrupt; only Yangquan City and Changyuan County in Henan-Shandong-Hebei-Henan and other places adopt a combination of self-study and collective study for cadres above the county level, with the cooperation of special reports to answer questions. Taiyue further emphasized the importance of reading seriously. For cadres who are mobile and scattered due to work, have low cultural levels, and do not have the ability to study on their own, some places in Beiyue, Southern Hebei, Taihang, Taiyue, and Central Jin have established study days, or a system of concentrated study after meetings, adopting the method of special reports (documents read by higher-level or more advanced comrades) and group reviews, but this correct method is still in the minority.

　　Since the promulgation of the North China Bureau's decision on on-the-job cadre study, various places are re-deploying studies based on this decision, and the cadre study movement will have a new development in the future. (Lu Xiliang)

### 华北各地干部加紧理论政策学习  现正依据华北局在职干部学习决定重新部署

　　华北各地干部加紧理论政策学习
    现正依据华北局在职干部学习决定重新部署
    【本报讯】近两月来，华北各地机关干部学习，已有显著进步。思想上的经验主义倾向与组织上无政府无纪律现象，正在积极克服中，正确掌握政策，学习理论为中心。各地布置的有“人民解放战争第二年总结与第三年的任务”、“农业社会主义问答”、情报局及中共中央“关于南共问题的决议”。阳泉等城市干部则学习工商政策与劳动政策。一般的都根据文件，检查了工作。
    各地学习，结合检查工作中无政府无纪律现象，在建立制度，特别是请示报告制度上，收到了显著的成绩。各地检讨出，不请示不报告，从组织上说是无政府无纪律，从思想上说，则是自己在工作中的经验主义，不重视领导作用，错误地将请示报告认为是“形式主义”是“负担”，而不了解，写报告必须深入了解情况，用思想分析问题、总结经验，这正是提高自己政治思想水平的一个有效的方法。
    对理论学习的重要，各地领导上也开始有了认识。九月以来，各地连续的举行了干部学习测验，测验的结果，有不少的同志对新民主主义革命性质与党的总政策总路线的了解，是模糊不清的，或者是割裂不完整的，有的忘了反封建，有的忘了反官僚资本，有的竟直答“现在为共产主义革命”。冀中有些县委书记，把新民主主义经济的构成，答为“资本主义经济与社会主义经济”。这显示我们干部的理论基础，是非常薄弱。
    由于政策学习，没有紧密的联系马列主义基本理论，与党的总路线总政策的学习；学习方法上有经验主义的毛病，因而思想的提高很不够，有些同志，总感觉对政策不摸底。针对这一情况，太岳布置了学习“新民主主义论”，“共产党宣言”等书，阳泉布置了学习“社会发展史”与“政治经济学”都是有益的。
    用测验推动学习，已被充分证明有效，冀中文新深县等地连续举行了两三次，太行武安，冀中任邱等县测验后，把问题的解答，加以公布，观城更把犯错误的答案予以批判，经过这样的测验，有些同志说：“咱革了这么几年命，连革命的路线都弄不清，太危险了。”许多人下决心说：“这回不算，下次再见。”有的在饭场上展开了争论；有的把问题的答案抄在自己笔记本子上；有的一到学习时间，就都认真研究问题。巨南等地抓紧火候，测验结束立即检讨了过去的学习，具体研究了今后的计划，并把测验定为制度。这些经验证明，举行测验是推动学习的有效方法。但是也有些地方为测验而测验，单纯为了刺激一下，事前无准备，突然闪击，使大家很恐慌，甚或躲避，或是请人代笔，“你愿意写啥就写啥，我没有意见。”测验之后，也不评判和总结，这是应该加以改进的。
    各地对学习领导虽已较前注意，但还有许多地方负责干部决心还很不够，据冀中十五个县委的调查，每月能坚持学习的不过三分之一，到二分之一，他们大部因工作忙，单纯督促别人，而放松了自己的学习。另外大量的区级干部，现在还缺乏读物教材，缺乏帮助。有的一人谈大家听；有的片面的集体学习不能深入，水平高的感到受束缚，不能提高；水平低的也觉得遭难，听不懂，插不进嘴；仅在阳泉市和冀鲁豫长垣等地对县以上的干部采取自学和集体学习相结合的方法，配合专人报告，解答问题。太岳更强调了认真读书的重要。对于干部因工作流动分散，文化水平低，没有自学能力的，北岳、冀南、太行、太岳、晋中有些地方都建立了学习日，或开会以后集中学习的制度采取专人报告（由上级或水平较高的同志讲文件）分组检讨的方法，但这种正确的方法还是少数的。
    自华北局关于在职干部学习的决定公布后，各地正根据这一决定重新布置学习，今后干部学习运动将有新的开展。      （鲁西良）
