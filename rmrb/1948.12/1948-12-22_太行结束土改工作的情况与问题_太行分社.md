The Taihang area concluded its land reform work after the autumn harvest, generally beginning across the entire region from mid-October to early November. Out of the 38 counties and 6,935 villages in the area, excluding the 1,313 villages that had already completed the process before autumn, the first batch of villages to be concluded after autumn totaled 1,812, with another 3,810 villages planned for later stages. By the end of November, the first batch of post-autumn land reform work was nearing completion in most areas, except for the fifth district, which was still in the middle of the movement, and the fourth district, where statistics were not yet available. Some areas, such as Xingtai, Zanhuang, Neiqiu, and Licheng counties, had already started the second batch. Individual counties, such as Pingshun and Wu'an, had either completely finished or were nearing completion. However, two important steps remained: issuing land certificates and conducting final summary education work. Nevertheless, most areas had formally announced the confirmation of land ownership. The production enthusiasm of all strata in these villages (including those still in progress) was unprecedentedly high, except for individual villages where policy implementation had been biased. This enthusiasm not only directly promoted current winter production but also fostered the idea and actions of long-term home-building, such as repairing and building houses and buying more livestock. Statistics from just 16 villages in Pingshun showed that over 140 households had made long-term production and development plans.

Regarding the overall results of the concluded land reform work, according to inspections of 712 villages that completed land reform before autumn (including 500 experimental villages in the spring) across the entire area, the first category of villages, i.e., those with good and correct conclusion steps, those that implemented policies correctly, those where party-mass relations improved after the conclusion, those where mass production enthusiasm greatly increased, and those that basically achieved the goal of unity and production, accounted for about 20%; the second category, i.e., those with relatively simple and crude methods but that basically completed their tasks, those that did not make new mistakes in policy implementation, those where party-mass relations mostly did not improve, but where mass production enthusiasm was still good, accounted for about 60%; and the third category, i.e., villages where the conclusion of land reform failed, accounted for about 20%. This means that the majority of areas correctly implemented the policies and achieved the goal of unity and production. (Editor's note: How can the majority of areas achieve unity and production when 60% have poor party-mass relations [which of course cannot be improved immediately] and 20% have failed?)

Regarding the methods and steps for concluding land reform, there were generally two approaches: one was adopted by counties such as Linxian, Cixian, Zuoquan, Yushe, Changzhi, and Lingchuan, where the district committee served as the core, combined with general district cadres and trained village cadres and party members, as the backbone or leading group, using base points (joint defense) or sub-areas to conduct short-term training for a large number of active elements among the masses, adopting a large-scale mobilization approach to quickly implement the policies among the masses. The advantage of this approach was that it could quickly spread the policies to every corner through these active elements, enabling the policies to quickly gain mass support and overcoming the difficulty of "too few district cadres and insufficient leadership." The other approach was where district cadres drilled down into one village, acted timidly, only focusing on creating typical examples, and engaging in small-scale, handicraft-style work based on the amount of available manpower, resulting in the policies not being understood by the masses in a timely manner, or allowing individual landlords, rich peasants, and bad elements to spread rumors and sabotage, putting the work in a passive and difficult position. Experience has shown that the first approach is better; however, the second approach also has some advantages, namely, it is more in-depth and provides a detailed understanding of the situation. If large-scale publicity and mobilization can be combined with in-depth and meticulous work, even better results can be achieved. Experience has shown that combining policy publicity and mass mobilization to conduct preliminary party rectification, adjust party-mass relations, and improve the leading core during the conclusion of land reform; and identifying the village's situation and formulating and reviewing work plans, are crucial steps in successfully completing the conclusion of land reform.

	The Combination of Concluding Land Reform and Party Rectification

Based on the actual work in various places before and after autumn, it has been proven that most branches have problems: some have conflicts between cadres and poor peasants since this spring, some have internal disunity reflecting rural sectarianism historically, some have misperceptions and concerns given to party members by certain biases during the spring party rectification, and some have backward and degenerated party members, etc. Preliminary rectification has greatly promoted the smooth progress of concluding land reform. Regarding the combination of concluding land reform and conducting preliminary party rectification, Linxian, Zanhuang, and other places have gained some experience. Zanhuang rectified different types of branches using different methods and content. Its main experience is to grasp the specific problems of different branches and solve them with a focus. First, affirm the branch's achievements, inspire party members to examine their shortcomings, distinguish right from wrong, clarify responsibilities, implement party member future education, and improve party member awareness and confidence; then, through policy education among party members and the masses, adjust party-mass relations using different methods and unite to conclude land reform.

	Formulating and Approving Plans

The general practice for formulating and approving plans is to combine the village's original land, population, and output accounts with an in-depth understanding of the situation among the masses, and then formulate the plan, which is discussed and approved by the district committee before being implemented. Doing this well is equivalent to doing half of the concluding land reform work; however, many areas are currently not strict or serious enough in its implementation, and some areas have even failed to do it at all, leading to biases.

	Rectifying Peasant Associations and Establishing People's Congresses

There are more biases in various places regarding the rectification of peasant associations and the establishment of temporary people's congresses. First, most areas lack a clear understanding of the purpose of rectifying peasant associations, and the widespread bias is that organizational rectification is emphasized over ideological rectification, forming rectification for the sake of rectification. The correct approach should be to focus on ideological rectification, implement policy education, and improve peasant awareness to remove ideological obstacles in concluding land reform, so that the policies are consciously supported by the peasants; and then improve the organization, organizing the peasants on the basis of ideological consciousness. Unite and educate middle peasants who have been wrongly struggled against, and the leadership should make appropriate self-criticisms. Lucheng Shenquan, Licheng Shanye, and other places have all adopted the method of summarizing and reviewing the role of peasant associations in land reform, so that peasants further recognize the importance of peasant associations, and the results of such rectification are better.

There are even more biases in various places in the establishment and use of temporary people's congresses. This shows that the masses and some cadres lack democratic habits and democratic knowledge. One bias is to view the people's congress as being established solely to complete the conclusion of land reform and to dissolve it after the conclusion of land reform. Some hastily establish them without first properly publicizing the role and powers of the people's congress, so many problems arise because the masses do not understand. Some specifically elect people they oppose to make them "waste their time"; some specifically elect middle peasants with more land and military dependents with higher statuses to be representatives to play a "model" role in order to make up for deficiencies; some think that the people's congress is a helper for cadres, and some think that "cadres are useless" with a people's congress. In addition to being able to correctly elect, organize, and use the people's congress according to the prescribed methods, the better approach is that Linxian Xiazhuang also paid attention to educating the representatives, and the Changzhi Gaohe branch discussed the three benefits of the representative meeting in advance, and the effect was great after publicity. After ideological mobilization and organizational rectification, the branch and the people's congress then lead the masses to formally conduct class and stratum differentiation, revise class status, and focus on making up for deficiencies, filling in gaps, and making arrangements.

	Planning the Source of Compensation and Resettlement

The most important but also the most error-prone aspect of planning the source of making up for deficiencies is the implementation of the issue of voluntarily transferring land. Improper handling can easily lead to biases. The experience of various places can be summarized into two points: one is to focus on political mobilization to inspire the spirit of unity, friendship, and mutual assistance among the peasants to achieve voluntary land transfer; the other is to call on some of the masses to calculate their labor and production situation, thereby consciously and voluntarily transferring some land. Experience has shown that the latter is the main method. For example, some middle peasants in Bopo, Huguan, voluntarily transferred land, mainly by working through their thinking from the perspective of their own economic interests. Political mobilization cannot be separated from this kind of calculation of actual interests; otherwise, true voluntarism cannot be achieved. In terms of the scope of the transfer, it has generally been achieved to affect the minority and not the majority, addressing the overall legacy issues (filling in gaps, compensating, resettling, etc.). After the handling is completed, the people's congress convenes a mass meeting of all strata to formally announce that land reform has ended and land rights have been confirmed, thereby formally issuing land certificates, conducting summary education, and mobilizing production. Some villages have also conducted a mass inspection of the entire conclusion of land reform, including the implementation of policies and the democratic style of cadres, to discover biases or inappropriate problems and correct and solve them in a timely manner. However, most areas have not done this well or have not done it at all.

Regarding the issuance of land certificates, according to the experience of Licheng Zizhen and individual villages in Pingshun, the issuance of land certificates must be regarded as an important link in continuing to mobilize the masses and develop production, overcoming the purely administrative and technical approach. During the issuance, the leadership should combine with the masses, organize mass land and house foundation measurements, and resolve various historical disputes to achieve further unity among the peasants.

	The Bias That Occurred Was Too Wide a Scope of Transfer; Attention Was Paid to the Struggle on Two Fronts

In the past month, the main and more common biases that have occurred in the implementation of policies are the violation of the principle of affecting the minority and not the majority, and the implementation of absolute egalitarianism. In Shahe, Lincheng, and some villages in the first, third, and sixth districts, it was discovered that compensation and transfer were carried out based on the average output of the entire village, with those with higher output transferring and those with lower output being compensated. Even those who had one or two more rooms, a few more mu of land, or those whose population had increased or decreased due to births, deaths, marriages, or adoptions, were absolutely required to transfer or receive compensation. As a result, the scope of transfers was very large, with the highest reaching over 50%. Some are still resisting compensation and resettlement. In Baliliwan Village, Wu'an, there are many existing fruits, which could basically solve the compensation, resettlement, and other problems of the village; however, the district cadres and village cadres leading the village divided the existing fruits equally among the entire village population. Some are also unwilling to correct the class status of wrongly classified households, or deliberately raise their class status in order to get more fruits, or do not compensate or resettle. In individual areas, serious right-leaning errors have also occurred. For example, in some villages in Qinyang, landlords have launched counterattacks, harming the interests of the peasants; in individual villages in Licheng and Zhangnan, excessive emphasis is placed on compensation and resettlement, without paying attention to the emancipation of poor peasants, forcing them to return land and livestock, etc. However, according to existing materials, the more common bias in the entire area is still left-leaning. After Xinhua News Agency pointed out in mid-November that "while correcting the left, we must also guard against the right," the leading ideology in various places has gradually become clear, implementing the struggle on two fronts and overcoming both left and right biases. After Lincheng accepted the criticism from the Party newspaper, it not only quickly corrected its mistakes but also immediately checked the year's production and the work of the organizations, greatly improving the work.

	Coercive Orders Must Still Be Paid Attention To

In terms of work style, due to the unclear policy thinking of some cadres, some adopted a substitution and monopolization, coercive orders, and simple and hasty approach in concluding land reform. In many villages in the fifth district of Wuxiang, the rectification of peasant associations was carried out without publicizing policies or mobilizing the masses. Because the masses did not understand, they were not interested in attending meetings. Lucheng Hehe Village concluded land reform in four days. Many villages conducted elections for people's congresses without branch discussions or mass deliberation. Fearing that the masses would not attend the meetings, militiamen were used as guards. In Neiqiu, many districts and villages dared not open up democracy or publicize policies, fearing that if the masses knew the policies, they would not be able to act flexibly. The excuse was that they were afraid of extreme democracy. All of these need to be further resolved in the future.

　　太行结束土改工作的情况与问题
    ——太行分社
    太行区秋后结束土改工作，从十月中旬至十一月初，全区即先后普遍开始。全区三十八个县六千九百三十五个村，除秋前已完成一千三百一十三个村以外，秋后第一批进行结束的共一千八百一十二个村，准备后期结束的还有三千八百一十个村。至十一月底，秋后第一批结束土改工作除五分区尚在运动的中段、四分区情况未计外，其余绝大部分地区已接近尾声。部分地区如邢台、赞皇、内邱、黎城等县已开始了第二批。个别县如平顺、武安等，已全部完成，或即将完成。但尚有两个重要步骤未进行：即填发土地证与最后的总结教育工作。但绝大部分地区已正式宣布确定了地权。这些村庄（连正在进行的村庄在内）的各阶层生产情绪，除个别村因执行政策发生偏向外，一般是空前地提高了。不但直接推动了当前的冬季生产，且有了长期建家的思想与行动，如修盖房屋、增买牲口等。只平顺十六个村统计，即有一百四十多户都订了长期的生产发家建设计划。
    关于整个结束土改工作执行的结果，根据全区在秋前（连春季五百个实验村在内）七百一十二个结束土改村检查，第一类村，即结束步骤好、正确的贯彻了政策、结束后党群关系改善、群众生产情绪大大提高、基本上达到了团结生产的目的者，约占百分之廿左右；第二类，做法上较简单粗糙，但也基本上完成了任务、执行政策上没出新错、党群关系多数未改善、但群众生产情绪还好者，约占百分之六十左右；第三类，即结束土改失败的村庄，约占百分之廿。这就是说，经大部分地区是正确地贯彻了政策，达到了团结生产的目的。（编者按：既有百分之六十党群关系不好〔当然也不是一下能好了的〕，又有百分之二十失败，如何能大部分地区达到团结生产？）
    关于结束土改的做法与步骤，大体有两种：一种是林县、磁县、左权、榆社、长治、陵川等县，以区委为核心，结合一般区干部和受过训的村干党员等，作为骨干或领导集团，以基点（联防）或分片对大批群众中积极分子进行短训，采取大动员的方式，一下把政策贯彻到群众中去。这种做法的好处是能通过这些积极分子，很快把政策传播到各个角落里去，使政策能很快得到群众的支持，并可克服“区干部少、领导不过来”的困难。另一种做法是，区干部钻到一个村里，捏手捏脚，只顾创造典型，有多少力量搞多少村的手工业做法，结果政策没有及时为群众所了解，或使个别地富与坏分子得以造谣破坏，工作陷于被动、不易搞开。经验证明，第一种做法较好；但第二种做法也有它一些好处，那就是比较深入，了解情况细致。如能把大规模宣传动员与深入细致相结合，就会搞得更好。经验证明：一方面结合政策宣传与发动群众，进行初步整党，调整党群关系，健全结束土改中的领导核心；一方面判明本村情况，制定与审查工作方案，这一步骤是很好完成结束土改的关键。
    　　　　结束土改与整党的结合
    根据秋前秋后各地实际工作中证明，绝大部分支部是有问题的：有的是今春以来的干部与贫农对立，有的是历史上农村中的宗派反映到党内的不团结，有的是春季整党中某些偏向所给予党员的错觉与顾虑，有的是党员的思想落后和蜕化等等。进行了初步整顿，对结束土改的顺利推进有很大作用。关于结合结束土改进行初步整党，林县、赞皇等地已取得一些经验。赞皇是分别支部不同类型、以不同方法、不同内容去整顿的。其主要经验是抓住具体支部的不同问题，有重点进行解决。首先肯定支部成绩，启发党员检讨缺点，分辨是非，明确责任，贯彻党员前途教育，提高党员觉悟与信心，再经过党众中的政策教育，进行不同方法的调整党群关系，团结起来进行结束土改。
    　　　　制订与批准方案
    关于制订方案与批准方案的一般做法，是根据村中原有土地人口产量账，与深入群众了解情况结合进行，制定后经区委会讨论批准而执行的。这一着做得好，等于做了结束土改工作的一半；但目前不少地区执行尚不够严格与认真，个别地区甚至没有进行，因而出了偏向。
    　　　　整顿农会与建立人代会
    关于整顿农会组织与建立临时人代会，各地的偏向较多。首先，大部分地区对整顿农会的目的不明确，普遍产生的偏向是组织整顿重于思想整顿，形成为整顿而整顿。正确的做法，应该是着重于思想整顿，贯彻政策教育，提高农民觉悟，以扫除结束土改中的思想障碍，使政策为农民自觉支持；进而在组织上予以健全，把农民在思想自觉的基础上组织起来。对误斗中农进行团结教育，领导上作适当检讨。潞城神泉、黎城善业等地，均是采取了总结与回顾农会在土改中的作用的办法，使农民进一步认识了农会的重要，这样整顿结果都较好。
    在成立与运用临时人代会上，各地的偏向更多。这说明群众和部分干部的民主习惯与民主知识是十分缺乏的。一种是把人代会看成单纯为了完成结束土改而成立，结束土改后就解散了。有的事先不很好宣传人代会的作用、职权等，就草率简单地成立起来，群众不了解，所以发生许多毛病。有的专选自己反对的人，叫他去“误工”；有的为了找补绽而专选土地多的中农与翻身较高的军属等当代表，让他们起“模范”作用；有的认为人代会是干部的帮手，有的认为有了人代会，“干部就没用了”。较好的做法，除能按照规定的办法正确进行选举、组织及运用外，林县下庄并注意了对代表的教育，长治高河支部事先讨论出代表会的三个好处，经过宣传，作用很大。经过思想发动与组织整顿后，支部与人代会即领导群众正式进行划分阶级阶层，改订成份，集中补绽，填补、安置。
    　　　　筹划补偿与安置的来源
    筹划补绽来源，最重要但又最易出错误的，是贯彻自愿抽动土地的问题。掌握不好，极易产生偏向。各地经验综合起来有两点：一是以政治动员为主，启发农民团结友爱的精神，而达到自让土地；一是号召部分群众计算自己的劳力和生产情况，从而自觉自愿的让出一些土地。这两个办法，经验证明后者是主要的。如壶关柏坡有些中农自让土地，主要是从自己的经济利益上打通思想的。政治动员也脱离不了这种实际利益的计算，否则便不能达到真正自愿。在抽动面上，一般都做到了动少数不动多数、大体的遗留问题（填、补、安置等）。处理完后，人代会即召开各阶层群众大会，正式宣布土改已结束，地权已确定，从而正式进行填发土地证，进行总结教育，发动生产。有的村并对整个结束土改进行了群众性的检查，包括政策之执行及干部之民主作风等，以发现偏向或不适当的问题，加以及时的纠正与解决。但大部分地区还没有象这样很好地进行，或未进行。
    关于发土地证，根据黎城子镇及平顺个别村的经验，必须把发土地证当成继续发动群众、发展生产的一个重要环节，克服单纯的行政手续与技术的做法。填发时，领导应与群众相结合，组织群众性的丈量土地与丈量房基，结合调解各种历史纠纷，达到农民进一步团结。
    　　　　发生的偏向是抽动面太宽　开始注意了两条战线斗争
    一月来，各地在执行政策中发生的偏向，主要的和较普遍的，是违反了动少数不动多数的原则，实行绝对平均。沙河、临城及一、三、六分区部分村庄，都发现按全村平均产量进行抽补，高者抽，低者补，对多分一、二间房、几亩地、或因生死嫁娶后人口增减的，均要绝对的抽出或补足。因而被抽动面很大，最高的竟达百分之五十以上。也有的仍在抵抗补偿安置。武安八里湾村现存许多果实，本可大体解决该村的补偿安置等问题；但领导该村的区干部及村干部，又把现存的果实按全村人口平分了。也有的不愿改正误门户的成份，或故意提高成份，以便多多分果实，或不补偿、不安置。个别地区，也发生严重的右倾错误。如沁阳部分村发生地主反攻，损害农民利益；黎城、漳南个别村庄过分强调补偿安置，不注意贫农翻身，强迫退地退牲口等现象。但根据现有材料，全区较普遍的仍然是左的偏向。十一月中旬新华社指出“在纠左中同时防右”后，各地在领导思想上逐渐明确起来，贯彻两条战线斗争，克服左右两种偏向。临城接受党报批评后，不但迅速改正了错误，并紧接着把全年生产及机关工作均作了检查，使工作大有起色。
    　　　　强迫命令作风　仍须注意肃清
    工作作风上，由于部分干部的政策思想不明确，有的在结束土改中采取了代替包办、强迫命令、简单草率的做法。武乡五区许多村庄，不宣传政策，不发动群众，即进行整顿农会。群众因为不了解，对开会不感兴趣。潞城和合村四天就把土改结束了。许多村不经过支部讨论，群众酝酿，即进行选举人代会。怕群众不到会，便用民兵站起岗来。内邱不少区村不敢开放民主，不敢宣传政策，怕群众知道了政策，办事不机动。借口是怕发生极端民主现象。以上这些，都需要在今后继续解决。
