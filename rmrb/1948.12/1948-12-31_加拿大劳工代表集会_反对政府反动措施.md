Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, December 28th: The Telecommunications Agency reports that representatives from over half of Canada's organized labor groups recently gathered in Montreal to vehemently protest the government's anti-communist persecution of labor unions, heavy taxes, rising living costs, war policies, and massive military expenditures. They also protested the government's failure to solve the urgently needed housing problem and to implement other peacetime facilities. Roy, the General Manager of the United Textile Workers of America (affiliated with the American Federation of Labor), stated at the meeting: "Canadian labor must make it clear that they demand a policy of peace and cooperation with all nations in the world." He further said: "Wall Street's policies are not the policies of Canadian labor." The Telecommunications Agency pointed out that Canada's 1949 budget is expected to include $350 million for military expenditures. The Canadian government also refuses to release the $533.3 million budget surplus from last year, which was intended for housing and other peacetime facilities, on the grounds that this sum (and much more) is now needed for the "defense" of the soon-to-be-concluded North Atlantic alliance.

　　加拿大劳工代表集会
  　反对政府反动措施
    【新华社陕北二十八日电】电通社讯：加拿大全国一半以上有组织的劳工团体的代表，最近在蒙特利尔集会，猛烈抗议政府对工会的反共迫害、苛重的税收、上涨的生活费用、战争政策和巨额的军事开支，并抗议政府没有能够解决急需的住宅问题和进行其他平时的设施。属于美国劳联的联合纺织工人工会总干事罗莱在会上说：“加拿大劳工必须说明白，他们要求和平政策及与世界上一切民族合作的政策。”他又说：“华尔街的政策并不是加拿大劳工的政策。”电通社指出：在加拿大一九四九年的预算中，预料有三亿五千万美元为军事开支。加拿大政府并拒绝吐出去年五亿三千三百万美元作住宅与其他平时设施的预算剩余，理由是这笔款项（而且还要增加很多）现在需要用作行将缔结的北大西洋联盟“防御”之用。
