Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, December 18th: TASS, New York, December 15th: Fear has again gripped American business circles. Despite the artificial stimulus of expanded armaments plans and the Marshall Plan, the American economy is still heading downwards. It is reported that the production cuts, which have so far mainly occurred in the eastern states, have now spread to industrial cities in the west. In the Cleveland area, various manufacturing companies have reduced their labor force because they are finding it difficult to market their products. United Press reported that the "Western Electric Company" in Chicago has laid off 300 workers. "American Aluminum Company" in Alcoa, Tennessee, announced that it plans to "temporarily" lay off thousands of workers. The coal mining industry is experiencing widespread layoffs as domestic and foreign demand for coal declines. The "Baltimore & Ohio" Railroad Company, which transports coal, announced that due to reduced freight volume, it will lay off 2,700 workers on December 10th and 10 percent of its junior staff. According to the New York Times, unemployment in the Stamford and Greenwich (Connecticut) areas has reached such a level that social leaders have called a special meeting to discuss the situation. At the same time, merchants are worried about the decline in retail sales in recent weeks, during the Christmas and New Year's Eve period, when goods are usually in high demand. (Note: According to the Associated Press's "Weekly Business Report" published on the 12th, US retail sales have been lower for the fifth consecutive week compared to the huge sales volume in the same period last year.)

The agricultural situation is also beginning to show signs of weakness. According to newspaper estimates, the net total value of agricultural income this year is 15.45 billion yuan, 8 percent lower than last year. The Department of Agriculture fears that a surplus of agricultural products will cause prices to fall further next year, and therefore urges farmers to plant less wheat, cotton, potatoes and other agricultural products in 1949.

Another report from the Associated Press on the 5th stated that the National Association of Manufacturers held its annual meeting in New York this week. The prevailing mood at the meeting revealed that entrepreneurs across the United States are distressed and restless. The thousands of entrepreneurs attending the conference said that businesses are in a worse state than current statistics indicate. A Columbia University professor and director of the National Bureau of Economic Research said at the annual meeting that there are signs that businesses are in a critical stage.

　　美国经济走向下坡路
    工厂纷纷减产解雇大批职工资本家们充满苦恼焦躁不安
    【新华社陕北十八日电】塔斯社纽约十五日讯：美国商界人士中又发生恐惧情绪。尽管用了扩充军备计划与马歇尔计划这种人为的刺激办法，美国经济仍将走下坡路。据报导：迄今主要表现在东部各州的减产情形，目前已扩展至西部各工业城市。在克利夫兰地区，各种制造公司已减少劳动力，因为他们在推销产品方面颇感困难。合众社报导：芝加哥“西方电气公司”已解雇三百名工人。田纳西州阿尔科亚的“美国铝公司”宣布拟“暂时”解雇数千名工人。煤矿工业中普遍发生解雇工人的情形，因为国内外对煤的需要皆减少。载运煤的“巴尔的摩尔·俄亥俄”铁路公司宣布：由于运货减少，该公司将于十二月十日解雇二千七百名工人，并解雇小职员百分之十。据纽约时报报导：斯坦福与格林威治（康涅狄格州）地区的失业情形，已达到这种程度，以至使社会领袖召开特别会议讨论这种情况。同时，在通常货物畅销的圣诞节与新年前夕的最近数周内，零售数量的降低，也使商人感到忧虑。（按：据美联社十二日发表的“一周商情”称，美零售业销售量已连续第五周比不上去年同期的巨大销售量。）
    农业情况也开始表现衰弱。据报纸估计：今年农业方面的净入总值为一百五十四亿五千万元，较去年低百分之八。农业部害怕农产品过剩将使明年物价更形下跌，因而敦促农民在一九四九年少种小麦、棉花、马苓薯等农产品。
    另据美联社五日讯：本周全国制造家协会在纽约举行年会，会中标本的情绪透露美全国各地的企业家正在苦恼和躁急。出席大会的数千企业家说：企业较目前统计数字所表示的更为低落。哥伦比亚大学教授与全国经济研究局局长在年会中说：企业有处在危急阶段中的迹象。
