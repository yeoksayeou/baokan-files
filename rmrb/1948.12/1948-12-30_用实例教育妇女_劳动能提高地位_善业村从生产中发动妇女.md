(Taixing Telegram) Shanye Village in Licheng, in concluding the land reform, paid attention to mobilizing women and achieved preliminary results and experiences. At the beginning of the mobilization, the village did not proceed based on the women's own interests and universal demands, but rather adopted general mobilization and explanations, taking a detour. During meetings, most women did not speak and their enthusiasm was low. Cadres were then assigned to go deep into the groups to provide assistance. First, a women's congress was held to conduct in-depth mobilization, pointing out the women's labor situation in their daily family life and their political and economic status, which enlightened the women's awareness and the idea of striving for equality. Secondly, the achievements of women's participation in labor production were used to enlighten women to recognize their own strength. After such a general mobilization, the labor production achievements of woman Zhao Hua'er were summarized as a model, influencing women throughout the village to calculate their own labor achievements. Finally, the entire village made a summary, which made women realize their great achievements and their important role in the family, further enhancing their enthusiasm for production and their confidence in striving for equality between men and women. They also had demands for liberation and equality. Wang Guiying said, "In the past, I thought that we women depended on men to live, but now it seems that men cannot do without women either." Zhang Laiju said, "In the past, we underestimated ourselves, always thinking that women were not useful, but now we know our importance. Although our women have made great achievements, our status in the family and society is not yet truly equal." Then, the examples of production hero Wang Guie and cadre Huo Qiaolian, who had status in the family and society because of their good labor production, were used to enlighten everyone's desire for production. On the basis of women's conscious demands, seventy-three women joined the farmers' association and democratically elected cadres of the women's department of the farmers' association. In order to consolidate and develop the achievements of women, a mass meeting was held to discuss the significance of mobilizing women, so that men could recognize the production achievements of women and their role in the family, and overcome some incorrect views on women among men. In this way, improving women from the perspective of production was also agreed upon by the men.

　　用实例教育妇女
  　劳动能提高地位
  　善业村从生产中发动妇女
    【太行电】黎城善业村在结束土改中，注意发动妇女，并取得初步成绩与经验。该村在开始发动时，没有根据妇女切身利益与普遍要求去进行工作，只是采取一般的动员讲解，走了一段弯路。在开会时，大部分妇女不说话，情绪不高，干部即分工深入小组进行帮助。首先召开妇女大会，进行深入动员，指出妇女在家庭日常生活中的劳动状况。和政治经济地位，启发了妇女觉悟性，和争取平等的思想，其次用妇女参加劳动生产的成绩，启发妇女认识自己的力量。经过这样大会动员后，即以总结妇女赵花儿的劳动生产成绩为典型，影响全村妇女都纷纷计算开自己的劳动成绩。最后由全村作了总结，使妇女认识了自己的伟大成绩，及在家中的重要作用，进一步提高了生产积极性，与争取男女平等的信心。并有了求解放求平等的要求。王贵英说：“过去我认为咱妇女是靠男人活，现在说来，男人离了妇女也不行。”张来菊说：“过去咱们自己就小看了自己，总认为女人家不顶什么用，现在可知道自己的重要了。咱妇女们虽然成绩不小，可是在家庭和社会上的地位还没有真正平等。”接着又用生产英雄王贵娥、干部霍巧莲因劳动生产好，在家庭和社会都有地位的实例，启发了大家生产的要求。在妇女自觉要求的基础上，七十三个妇女参加了农会，并民主选出农会妇女部的干部。为了巩固发展妇女的成果，并召开了群众大会，讨论发动妇女的意义，使男人认识了妇女的生产成绩及在家庭的作用，克服了男人中某些对妇女不正确的观点。这样从生产上提高妇女，男人也都赞同。
