Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 25th. Electromotion Paris, 19th: The French General Confederation of Labor, the "Workers' Force" Union, and the Christian Workers' League have jointly issued letters to members of all political parties, demanding that the current stipulated minimum monthly wage of 11,900 francs be increased starting in January of next year, and that the relationship between wages and prices should be re-examined every four months.

According to TASS: Because the French government has decided to increase rents starting next January, many working-class families are facing the threat of eviction. After considering the rent subsidy bill being discussed by the National Assembly's Economic Committee, the Executive Committee of the French General Confederation of Labor instructed the representatives of the General Confederation of Labor on the Economic Committee on the 15th to vote against abolishing the special subsidy for children over the age of five, and against the government's regulation that only 330,000 families out of two million families with two or more children are entitled to increased rent subsidies. The Executive Committee of the General Confederation of Labor emphasized that factory workers should demand a 25 percent increase in wages and the issuance of subsidies necessary to cover increased rent.

　　法国三大工会联合要求增资
    【新华社陕北二十五日电】电通社巴黎十九日讯：法国总工会、“工人力量”工会及基督教工人联盟，顷向一切政治党派的议员们发出联合函件，要求在明年一月份起，应提高目前规定的一万一千九百法郎的每月最低工资，工资与物价的关系应规定每四个月重新查核一次。
    又据塔斯社讯：由于法国政府决定自明年一月起增加房租，使许多工人家庭已面临着被逐出住所的威胁。法国总工会执委会在考虑了国民议会经济委员会在讨论中的房租补助金法案以后，于十五日训令总工会在经济委员会中的代表们，投票反对取消对五岁以上儿童的特别补助金，并反对政府对二百万个有两个以上的儿童的家庭，只规定三十三万个家庭得享有增加房租补助金的法令。总工会执委会强调工厂职工应要求增加工资百分之二十五，并发给因增加房租所必需的补助金。
