　　Defeating Capitalists' Resistance
  　Japanese Seamen's Strike Ends in Victory
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 27th. Tokyo dispatch: The 17-day Japanese seamen's general strike, after defeating the capitalists' resistance, ended victoriously on the night of the 20th. This strike began on November 29th, and excluding five days of intervals, was conducted in eight phases, each lasting either 48 hours or 72 hours. During the strike, approximately 500 ships were forced to halt operations in ports across Japan, accounting for over 70% of the total number of Japanese ships. This strike dealt a significant blow to the stubborn capitalists, causing them losses estimated at approximately 340 million Japanese yen. By midnight on the 20th, after the capitalists were forced to agree to the union's demand for a 30% wage increase, retroactive to October, the All-Japan Seamen's Union decided to resume work.

    Simultaneously with the Japanese seamen's general strike, Japanese coal mine, electricity, private railway, and textile unions have recently become successively involved in strike waves. Seeing this situation, MacArthur's headquarters, disregarding the Far Eastern Commission's decision to guarantee the freedom of the Japanese labor movement, hurriedly came out to interfere. On the 19th, MacArthur sent a letter to Japanese Prime Minister Yoshida, issuing a so-called threat that "both labor and management must not interfere with the acceleration of production"; on the 20th, he also ordered the head of his headquarters' labor group, Heberle, to "summon" the leaders of various trade unions, openly warning them to immediately cancel all strikes, "effectively eliminating the right of Japanese workers to strike" (TASS). The Japan Industrial Labor Union Federation, the largest labor organization in Japan, issued a protest declaration stating: The Japanese ruling clique disregards the restoration of the national economy and attempts to abolish strikes and suppress the wage increase movement of trade unions, and uses the well-known MacArthur directive for this purpose. The declaration stated that the Industrial Labor Union Federation would fight against this attempt and to defend the sixteen principles of the Far Eastern Commission regarding the freedom of the labor movement. The declaration also demanded the immediate resignation of the Yoshida cabinet.

### 击破了资本家的抵抗　日海员罢工胜利结束

　　击破了资本家的抵抗
  　日海员罢工胜利结束
    【新华社陕北二十七日电】东京消息：坚持十七日的日本海员工人大罢工，在击破资方的抵抗后，已于二十日夜胜利结束。这次罢工开始于十一月二十九日，其中除去五天的间歇外，共分八次进行，每次或为四十八小时，或为七十二小时。罢工期间，全日各港口被迫停驶的船只，共有五百艘左右，占日本船只总数的百分之七十以上。这一罢工给顽固的资方以巨大的打击，使其损失约达三亿四千万日元。至二十日午夜，在资方不得不同意工会方面关于增加工资百分之三十并回溯至十月份计算的要求后，全日海员工会遂决定复工。
    与日本海员举行大罢工同时，日本煤矿、电气、私营铁道及纺织等工会，最近均相继卷入罢工浪潮。麦克阿瑟总部看到这种形势，不顾远东委员会关于保障日本工运自由的决定，连忙出来干涉。麦氏一面于十九日致函日首相吉田，发出所谓“劳资双方均不得干扰生产的加速”的威胁；一面又令其总部的劳工组组长赫勃勒于二十日“召见”各工会领袖，公开警告他们应立即取消一切罢工，“实际上取消日本工人的罢工权利”（塔斯社）。日本最大的劳工组织——产业劳动组合联合会为此特发表抗议宣言称：日本统治集团漠视国民经济的恢复，企图取消罢工及压制工会的增加工资运动，并为此而使用众所周知的麦克阿瑟指令。宣言表示，产联将为反对这种企图、为保卫远东委员会关于工运自由的十六条原则而战斗。宣言并要求吉田内阁立即辞职。
