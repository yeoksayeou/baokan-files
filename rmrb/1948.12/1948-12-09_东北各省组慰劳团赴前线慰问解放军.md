Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, December 6th: Last week, the provinces of Songjiang, Nenjiang, Heilongjiang, Liaoning, and Liaobei in Northeast China organized comfort groups that carried large quantities of comfort goods to the front lines to visit and console the People's Liberation Army undergoing training. After the Liaobei Provincial Comfort Group, led by Chairman Yan Baohang of Liaobei Province, arrived at the front lines, they held a celebration with commanders and fighters of a certain unit. Chairman Yan, on behalf of the eight million people of Liaobei, paid tribute to the People's Liberation Army, thanking them for liberating the entire Northeast, and earnestly stated: governments at all levels will definitely ensure that the work of giving preferential treatment to the families of soldiers is done well, so that they all have land to cultivate, work to do, and cotton clothes to wear. The commanders and fighters immediately responded with the slogan: "Resolutely realize the people's hopes, fight to Nanjing, and capture Chiang Kai-shek alive!" Political Commissar Wu of the unit instructed all commanders and fighters to be models of implementing government decrees and protecting the interests of the people, in order to thank the support of the people of Northeast China. All circles in the city are also launching the same comfort movement.

　　东北各省组慰劳团赴前线慰问解放军
    【新华社沈阳六日电】上周东北松江、嫩江、黑龙江、辽宁、辽北等省分别组织慰问团，携带大批慰劳物品，来到前线慰问整训中的解放军。辽北省阎宝航主席率领的辽北各界慰问团来到前线后，即与某部指战员举行联欢会。阎主席代表辽北八百万人民向解放军致敬，感谢他们解放全东北，并恳切表示：各级政府一定保证作好优待军人家属的工作，使他们都有地种，有工做，有棉衣穿。指战员们立刻以“坚决实现人民的希望，打到南京去，活捉蒋介石！”的口号作答。该部吴政委指示全体指战员要做执行政府法令、爱护人民利益的模范，以感谢东北人民的拥戴。本市各界亦正发起同样的慰问运动。
