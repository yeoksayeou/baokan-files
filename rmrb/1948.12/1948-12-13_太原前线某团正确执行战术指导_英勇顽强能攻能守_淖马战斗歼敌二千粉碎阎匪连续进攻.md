    A Regiment on the Taiyuan Front Correctly Implemented Tactical Guidance
    Showing Heroic Tenacity in Both Offense and Defense
    The Battle of Nuoma Annihilated 2,000 Enemy Troops, Crushing Yan’s Continuous Offensives
    [Telegram from the Taiyuan Front] In the battle to capture Nuoma, an important stronghold on the periphery of Taiyuan, a certain regiment, due to its resolute tenacity and correct implementation of tactical instructions from higher authorities, successfully completed its offensive and defensive tasks and was commended by the leaders of the military group in a circular. The "Soldiers' News" of the military group also published a short commentary entitled "Able to Attack and Defend, Unmatched in the World," calling on the entire army to learn from them. The regiment was initially ordered to hold the main position, and within two days, it repelled more than ten enemy counterattacks of various sizes. Later, in the battle for the pillbox, not only did it eliminate a battalion of defending enemies under extremely unfavorable terrain conditions, completing the assault mission, but it also crushed a desperate counterattack by more than 2,000 enemy troops for a whole day, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy, and the position remained unshaken. This contributed greatly to our occupation and consolidation of the entire Nuoma position. In these two battles, a total of approximately 2,400 enemy troops were killed, wounded, or captured. In addition to the tenacious fighting spirit of all the commanders and fighters of the regiment, another major reason for these victories was that the entire unit, especially the commanding officers such as the regiment commander Li Cunchun and the staff officer Jiang Gang, correctly implemented the tactical instructions from higher authorities and understood that offense and defense are inseparable aspects of the entire battle. Therefore, when they received the assault mission, they simultaneously made preparations for both offense and defense to prevent possible desperate counterattacks by the enemy. They believed that abandoning a position that had been won with bloodshed was tantamount to shedding blood in vain. From actual combat, they experienced that holding a position, like attacking, is active, not passive. Holding a position is for continuing to advance and can create many favorable conditions for killing the enemy. When holding the main position, the leading comrades of the regiment made a specific analysis to the troops, pointing out that when the enemy relies on stored ammunition and fixed firepower, trapped in strong fortifications such as bunkers and trenches, and we have to carry explosives and grenades to attack them, then when they break away from these conditions and dare to come out to counterattack, as long as we subjectively create some favorable conditions, it is entirely possible to inflict heavy casualties on the enemy. Therefore, they resolutely implemented two powerful battle slogans within the unit to crush the enemy's counterattacks: one was "Eliminate the enemy before they reach the position!" and the other was "If the enemy breaks through the position, eliminate them within the position!" The construction of fortifications, the organization of firepower, the deployment of troops, the determination of command, etc., in actual combat were all based on these two slogans as guiding principles. Before the regiment attacked the pillbox, it not only repeatedly reconnoitered the terrain, carefully selected the breakthrough point, and concealed the troops in several cave dwellings near the pillbox in advance, shortening the attack route, but also conducted sand table exercises and on-site drills, especially combat drills for holding the position. They made full preparations for how to fight before the enemy broke through the position and how to fight after the enemy broke through the position. They made full preparations from the basic understanding of holding the position to various tactical movements. After occupying the position, they immediately organized the cadres and soldiers to observe the terrain, estimate the routes and breakthrough points the enemy might use for counterattacks, build fortifications, deploy troops and firepower, and make specific divisions of labor. The enemy would be fired upon at a certain distance and with a certain amount of firepower. When the battle developed to a certain situation, certain troops would attack. Under this scientific organization, they could not only kill a large number of enemies in crushing their counterattacks but also capture prisoners every time. Even in the most urgent situation where the enemy broke through the position, they could respond calmly and turn danger into safety. For example, when holding the main position, the enemy once broke through the position, and the reserve troops in the rear, without waiting for orders, automatically attacked according to the original plan, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy who had entered the position and quickly driving them out of the position. In the pillbox battle, when the enemy launched their largest counterattack, they had already occupied one-third of our position, but all the commanders and fighters remained firm and calm, conducting fierce battles in an orderly manner. After crushing the enemy's counterattack, they took advantage of the victory to attack and occupy another pillbox. Some soldiers said, "This battle was exactly the same as the exercises we did in the past."

    太原前线某团正确执行战术指导
    英勇顽强能攻能守
    淖马战斗歼敌二千粉碎阎匪连续进攻
    【太原前线电】在这次攻占太原外围重要据点淖马战斗中，某团部队由于坚决顽强与正确执行上级战术指示，胜利完成了攻守任务，荣获兵闭首长的通令表扬。兵团子弟兵报并以“能攻又能守，天下无敌手”为题，发表短论，号召全军向他们学习。该团最初奉命坚守主阵地，两天以内粉碎了敌人大小十多次反扑。以后在炮碉争夺战中，不但在地形极端不利的条件下，消灭了一个营的守备敌人，完成了攻坚任务，而且接着又粉碎了敌人两千多兵力整整一天的拼命反扑，并予敌以极大杀伤，阵地屹立不动，对我占领与巩固淖马全部阵地贡献极大。在这两次战斗中，杀伤俘掳敌人共约二千四百多人。这些胜利的取得，除该团全体指战人员的顽强斗志外，另一个最主要原因，就是整个部队特别是该团团长李存春与参谋长江岗等指挥人员正确执行了上级的战术指示，了解了攻与守是整个战斗不可分离的两个方面。因此，当他们受领攻坚任务的时候，即同时进行攻守两种准备，以预防敌人可能进行的垂死反扑。他们认为把流了血打下来的阵地随便丢掉，就等于把血白白流了。从实战中，他们体验到坚守阵地和攻击一样，是积极的，而不是消极的。坚守阵地是为了继续前进，并且可以创造许多杀伤敌人的有利条件。在坚守主阵地的时候，该团领导同志曾向部队具体分析，指出当敌人依靠着储存弹药与固定火力，困守在碉堡、壕沟等坚固城防以内，我们还要扛着炸药、手榴弹去打他，那末当他脱离这些条件敢于出来反扑的时候，只要我们主观上创造一些有利条件，就完全有可能给敌人以重大杀伤。因此，他们在部队里面坚决贯彻了粉碎敌人反扑两个有力的战斗口号：一个是“把敌人消灭在阵地以前！”另一个就是“如果敌人突破了阵地，就把他消灭在阵地以内！”在实战中的工事构筑、火力组织、兵力布置、指挥决心等，都是以这两个口号来作为指导根据的。该团在攻击炮碉以前，不但反复侦察地形，慎重选择突破口，事先把部队隐蔽到碉堡附近的几个窑洞里面，缩短了进攻道路。而且进行了沙盘作业与实地演习，特别是进行了坚守阵地的战斗演习。在敌人突破阵地以前如何打，敌人突破阵地以后又如何打。从坚守阵地的基本认识到各种战术动作，都做了充分准备。占领阵地后，又立刻组织干部战士看地形，估计敌人反扑可能经过的道路与突破口，修造工事与布置兵力火力，并进行具体分工。敌人前进到一定距离，一定的火力发射。战斗发展到一定情况，一定的部队出击。在这种科学组织下，就能在粉碎敌人反扑中，不但大量杀伤了敌人，而且每次都能捉住俘虏。即使在敌人突破阵地这种最紧急的情况下，亦能应付自如，转危为安。例如在坚守主阵地时，有一次敌人突破了阵地，在后面的预备部队，还没有等命令下来，就按照原来计划自动出击，给陷入阵地的敌人以重大杀伤，并迅速将其驱出阵地。在炮碉争夺战中，当敌人最大一次反扑的时候，已经占领了我军阵地的三分之一，但全体指战人员仍能坚定沉着，有秩序地进行着激烈的战斗。在粉碎了敌人反扑后，又乘胜向前攻占了一个碉堡。有的战士说：“这次打的仗，跟过去演习的一模一样。”
