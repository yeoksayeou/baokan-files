　　【Taihang News】After completing land reform, Zizhen Village in Licheng, according to the demands of the masses, issued land certificates, clearly guaranteeing the land, housing, and property rights of all classes, consolidating and stabilizing popular sentiment, and inspiring the enthusiasm of the masses for production and prosperity. Initially, in order to unify leadership and clarify division of labor, a Land Certificate Issuance Committee was established, composed of the village head, branch secretary, people's congress chairman, civil affairs, finance directors, and mass representatives, totaling nine people. Under the committee were three sections: surveying, mediation, and filling. After publicizing the purpose and significance of issuing land certificates, everyone was called upon to declare their land. Sampling surveys were conducted for those who needed them, such as newly reclaimed land, river-eroded land, and newly distributed land, but care was taken not to form a general survey, as this would waste too much work and easily detach from the masses. Regarding the surveying of residences, this was carried out by lane-based groups. Self-surveying was mutually accountable, and attention was paid to mediating disputes. When registering land, the draft was first copied from the land account books, and each household reported the four boundaries. The information was read out by lane unit to allow each household to raise opinions and questions. The masses raised opinions very seriously. Ren Shuqin said, "Thousand-year-old paper can speak, so it must be clarified." The masses raised a total of fifty-five issues, such as Yang Side's issue regarding the road through Ren Lingtai's field, and Wang Sanxiu's issue regarding the persimmon trees in Wang Fuke's land. All were resolved one by one.
　　During the process, cadres also publicized to the masses that, for the convenience of cultivation, both parties could freely exchange land voluntarily. In the spirit of unity in production, farmers negotiated and exchanged land with each other. When issuing new certificates, it was declared that all old contracts were invalid and should be handed over to the county. (If farmers are unwilling to hand them over, it is not necessary to force them - Editor).
　　During the process of issuing land certificates, attention was also paid to resolving the remaining issues from the conclusion of land reform. For example, Sun Xiaotu (a rich peasant) mortgaged eight mu of land to Zheng Long'er before land reform. After specific research, it was determined that each family owned half of the land rights. This also settled the rich peasant. A total of seven such issues were resolved.
　　After concluding land reform and issuing land certificates, the masses have a high enthusiasm for getting rich and producing. Fu Shangxian said: "Land certificates stabilize the hearts of all classes. Hurry up and accumulate more fertilizer and firewood to prepare for large-scale production next year." The entire village has now organized and launched a winter production campaign. In addition to production activities such as accumulating fertilizer, spinning, ginning cotton, and transportation, there are also two mills and a tofu workshop, which are being actively prepared.

　　子镇村发下土地证
  　冬季生产立即开展
    【太行讯】黎城子镇村在完成结束土改后，根据群众要求，颁发了土地证，明确保障各阶层地权房权财权，巩固安定了人心，启发了群众生产发家的热情。开始为了统一领导明确分工，成立了填发土地证委员会，由村长、支部书记、人代会主席、民政、财政主任及群众代表等九人组成，下设丈量、调解、填写等三股。在宣传了发土地证的目的与意义之后，号召大家自报土地，有需抽丈者进行抽丈，如新开荒地、河冲地及新分土地等，但注意不要形成普丈，因这样误工多易脱离群众。关于住宅的丈量，以巷结合小组进行。自行丈量互相负责，并注意调解纠纷。登记土地时，先按地亩账抄下草底，各户报了四至，以巷为单位宣读，让各户提意见和问题，群众都很认真的提意见，任书芹说：“千年纸张会说话，一定要弄清楚。”群众共提问题五十五件，如杨四德提出任令太场里有他的路的问题，王三秀提出王福可地里有他柿树的问题，都一一进行了解决。
    在进行中干部并向群众宣传，为了耕作便利，双方自愿可自由兑换地。农民在团结生产的精神下，互相协商进行了调换。发新证时对旧契纸声明一律作废交县。（如农民不愿交，也不必勉强要——编者）
    在发土地证过程中，并注意解决结束土改中的遗留问题。如孙小秃（富农）土改前典给郑龙儿土地八亩，经具体研究，确定地权各家一半，这样同时也安置了富农，此类问题共解决七件。
    结束了土改又发下土地证后，群众发家生产热情很高，傅尚贤说：“土地证安住了各阶层人心，赶快多积肥多打柴，准备明年大生产”。现全村已有组织的开展了冬季生产运动。除积肥、纺织、弹轧花、运输等生产外，还有两座磨坊及豆腐坊，正在积极准备中。
