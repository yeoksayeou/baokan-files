　　Issues to Note When Ending Land Reform
  　Farmers' Opinions Must Be Valued
  　Anping County Party Committee Corrects Paternalistic Practices
    [Our Newspaper] Reporter Qian Feng reports: Currently, Anping is waging a two-front battle in ending land reform. During last year's land reform, some areas experienced relatively serious infringements on the interests of middle peasants. However, during the correction of leftist errors this spring, there were also phenomena of lowering the class status of landlords and rich peasants, resulting in incomplete elimination of feudalism. Recently, seven households of "leaky" landlords were discovered in the North Guan Village of the urban area, and individual landlords in the Eighth District, Yan Tong, still possess land exceeding the village's average landholding. Since the beginning of the effort to conclude land reform, cadres have earnestly focused on correcting leftist errors concerning the first situation, carefully reviewing and revising the wrongly classified middle peasants' status, and have begun to compensate for confiscated property. These achievements cannot be ignored. However, many cadres have insufficient understanding of the latter situation, especially regarding the importance of relying on poor and landless peasants to unite with middle peasants in the work of ending land reform. In the past twenty-odd days of work, two types of erroneous sprouts have been discovered: one is that some were misled by the small amount of property owned by landlords and rich peasants during class determination, leading to lowering the class status of landlords and rich peasants. For example, in Yan Tong, four households of landlords who were accurately classified last year were mistakenly reclassified as rich peasants and well-to-do middle peasants. The other is that in the work, poor and landless peasants were sidelined or their opinions were ignored, leading to paternalistic practices by the work teams. The latter occurred in many villages, most notably in Shigan Village in the Sixth District. As soon as the Shigan work team arrived in the village, they simply convened meetings with middle peasants and only visited wrongly struggled middle peasants. The work team apologized and made amends to them. For five or six days, no one approached the poor and landless peasants. Later, the poor and landless peasants sarcastically said, "It's someone else's turn to be liberated this year!" Only when the poor peasants didn't participate in the meetings did the work team realize something was wrong. Although they made self-criticisms, many comrades only regarded this issue as a matter of working methods, without truly understanding it ideologically. Therefore, when returning confiscated property to wrongly struggled middle peasants, they more or less abandoned the poor and landless peasants, forming a paternalistic approach. The method of returning and compensating in the village was that without in-depth discussion among the peasants (the work team only talked about the principle of uniting with middle peasants at the representative meeting), the work team directly convened a meeting of wrongly struggled middle peasants. At that time, some wrongly struggled households suggested that whoever owned the item should claim it back, so each person took back their respective items. Since the land reform, the village has been experiencing disunity between middle and poor peasants, but the work team did not resolve this issue through this compensation to middle peasants. Not only that, the work team did not give appropriate criticism or stop the individual wrongly struggled households from openly scolding poor peasants. This created a situation of pouring cold water on the poor and landless peasants. After discovering the above right-leaning phenomena, the county party committee severely criticized it and called on all key villages to launch a two-front battle in the work of ending land reform. The county party committee believes that the reason why some work teams in the county made the above mistakes is mainly because some cadres one-sidedly believe that the current task of ending land reform is simply to compensate the losses of middle peasants. Therefore, they do not have enough understanding of further mobilizing the masses to correct policies and solve all the problems left over from the land reform during the concluding phase of the land reform. Also precisely because of this, some work cadres mistakenly believed that the only working target in this completion of land reform was wrongly struggled households. Thus, they regarded the Party's line of relying on poor and landless peasants to unite with middle peasants as insignificant. The county party committee emphasized that in the work of ending land reform in each village, we must resolutely use the policy of relying on poor and landless peasants to unite with middle peasants to correct policies. The keys to correcting policies are one, mastering the actual situation, and two, clearly defining class status.

### 结束土改应注意的问题　必须重视农民意见　安平县委纠正包办现象

　　结束土改应注意的问题
  　必须重视农民意见
  　安平县委纠正包办现象
    【本报讯】记者千峰报导：目前安平结束土改中正进行着两条战线的斗争。该县去年土改，部分地区曾发生了较重的侵犯中农利益的现象，但今春纠左时也发生了降低地富成份，消灭封建不彻底的现象。市区北关村最近又发现七户漏斗地主，八区严瞳个别地主占有土地数量仍高于全村土地平均数。此次结束土改以来，干部到村针对第一种情况认真注意了纠左，慎重的审查改订了错斗中农的成份，并开始补偿浮财，这些成绩不容忽视。但也有许多干部对于后一种情况认识不足，特别对于依靠贫雇农团结中农来进行结束土改工作的认识比较模糊。过去二十多天的工作过程中，发现两种错误的萌芽：一是在划阶级中被地富财产不多的现象所迷惑而降低了地富的成份，如严瞳就曾把去年评得准确的四户地主又错误的评成了富农和富裕中农。一是在工作中踢开贫雇农或忽视贫雇农的意见，造成工作组包办。后者在不少村庄都曾发生，尤以六区石干村最为明显。石干工作组一到村，只是单纯的召开了中农会议，访问对象也都是错斗中农，工作组向他们道歉、赔罪，五六天时间没人接近贫雇农，直到后来贫雇农在旁边讽剌的说：“今年该着别人翻身了！”开起会来贫农不参加的时候，工作组才感到不对，虽也进行了检讨，但许多同志仅把这个问题看作了工作方法问题，没有真正从思想上弄通，所以在向错斗中农退浮财时，又或多或少的抛开了贫雇农而形成包办。该村退补的方法是没经过农民深刻的讨论（只在代表会上由工作组讲了一下团结中农的道理），就由工作组直接召开错斗中农会，当时有的错斗户提出谁家的东西谁认回，于是你一件他一件的各自拿了回去。土改以来该村就产生着中贫农不团结的现象，然而工作组没通过这次补偿中农来解决了这个问题。不仅如此，工作组对于个别错斗户破口大骂贫农的错误现象，也不给以适当批评和制止。这样就造成给贫雇农泼冷水的现象。县委在发现上述右倾现象后，已给予严厉批驳，并号召各个重点村在进行结束土改工作中展开两条战线的斗争。该县某些工作组所以产生上述错误的原因，县委认为主要是有些干部片面的认为此次结束土改只是单纯的补偿中农损失，因此对于在结束土改中进一步发动群众端正政策，解决土改中所遗留下的一切问题认识不够。也正由于这样，有些工作干部错误的认为此次结束土改唯一的工作对象只是错斗户，所以就把党的依靠贫雇农团结中农的路线看得无足轻重。县委强调指出各村结束土改中，必须坚决以依靠贫雇农团结中农的方针来端正政策。端正政策的钥匙，一个是掌握实际情况，一个是划清阶级。
