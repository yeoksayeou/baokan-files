　　Zhenhua Coal Mine Should Immediately Return Land Occupied from the Masses
    Question: Xitianhe Village is a coal-producing area in Wutai. The Zhenhua Coal Mine (state-owned) began mining coal in the area last spring, occupying five mu of land belonging to the masses. The land was originally rented from the masses (renting for 10 silver dollars per month) (converted to border currency at the corresponding ratio). When the land reform arrived, the rent was stopped. The land was not divided during the land reform and has been occupied by the Zhenhua Coal Mine for mining. When the land was registered for agricultural tax this year, the land was registered to the Zhenhua Coal Mine, and they were taxed, but the Zhenhua Coal Mine did not pay. Nor did they state how to handle the occupied land from the masses. Who should the land ownership belong to? Should it belong to the public? Or should it belong to the masses of the village? Who is responsible for the agricultural tax? We hope to have an answer in the newspaper. (Yao Wen, Shi Chang, Sixth District of Wutai)
    Answer: It is very wrong for the Zhenhua Coal Mine to occupy the land of the masses in Xitianhe Village and not pay the burden. The land ownership should be quickly returned to the village and distributed and handled by the village. Zhenhua Coal Mine can negotiate with the land owners for use as borrowed land, set the rent amount, and pay the rent on time. The land owners are responsible for paying the agricultural tax.

　　振华煤窑占用群众土地应即退还
    问：西天和村是五台产煤区域，振华号（公营）去春即在该地区开挖煤炭，占了群众地五亩，地原先是租群众的（每月出租白洋十元）（按比值折给边币），到土改时，这租子即停止了，土改时也未将该地平分，一直由振华号占着挖煤。在今年农业税登记土地时，将那块地就给振华号登记上，向他征税，振华号不出，但也没声明占用群众土地是该如何？土地所有权该归谁？还是归公家呢？还是归该村群众呢？农业税由何人负责？希在报纸上答复。（五台六区耀文、世昌）
    答：振华号煤窑占用西天和村群众的土地又不出负担，这是很不对的，应赶快把土地所有权交给该村，由该村分配处理。振华号可向土地所有人协商作为借用，订出租额，按时交租。农业税由土地所有人负责缴纳。
