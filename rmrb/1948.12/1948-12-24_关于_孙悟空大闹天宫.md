To the Editor Regarding "Sun Wukong's Havoc in Heaven":
    In the People's Daily November 15th editorial, "Transforming Old Operas in a Planned and Step-by-Step Manner," it was suggested that general mythological stories like "Sun Wukong's Havoc in Heaven" could be performed. On the evening of the 18th, the Ma Youliang Drama Troupe performed "Havoc in Heaven" at the Wu'an Public Theater. At that time, our Sixth District was holding an arts symposium for various counties to discuss the issue of reforming old operas. After everyone watched "Sun Wukong's Havoc in Heaven," it sparked heated debate. Some comrades said it could still be performed, reasoning that "Sun Wukong represents the peasant class rising up against the ruling class, and has revolutionary spirit," making it different from other superstitions. Some comrades thought it should not be performed at all, also with their reasons: "Although Sun Wukong represents the peasant class rising up against the ruling class of Heaven," which is good, he appears in the form of gods and ghosts. Most of the audience are ordinary citizens who will not critically accept it but only be influenced by gods and ghosts. For example, some members of the public said after watching it: "Look how powerful those heavenly soldiers and generals, golden boys and jade maidens are; there really are gods and ghosts in the world!" This has fueled the superstition of the majority of the masses. We feel that both views have their reasons. Our opinion is that it can be performed for cadres, but if it is to be performed for the masses, it must undergo significant revisions. We wonder if this is correct?

　　关于“孙悟空大闹天宫”编辑同志：
    人民日报十一月十五号专论：有计划有步骤的进行改造旧剧一文中，对一般的神话故事如孙悟空大闹天宫，认为可以出演。十八号晚上，马友良戏剧团就在武安大众剧院演出“大闹天宫”。当时我们六分区正召开各县文艺座谈会，讨论改造旧剧问题，大家看了孙悟空大闹天宫之后，引起大家纷纷争论，有些同志说还可以演，理由是“孙悟空是代表农民阶级起来反抗统治阶级的，有革命性”，他和别的迷信不一样；有些人认为是根本不能出演，也有他的理由：“孙悟空虽然代表农民阶级起来反抗天宫统治阶级”，这是好的，但他用神鬼形式出现，观众大部分是一般市民群众，不会批判接受，只给他们一个有神有鬼的影响。如有的群众看后这样说：“看人家天兵天将，还有金童玉女多厉害，世界上就是有神有鬼！”这样助长了大部群众的迷信。我们感到这两种意见都有他的理由。我们的意见可给干部出演，若要给群众出演的话，也得经过重大的修改。不知是否正确？ 　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（张一英、江琦）
