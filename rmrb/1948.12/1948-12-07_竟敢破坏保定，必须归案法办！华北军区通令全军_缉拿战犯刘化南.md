Xinhua News Agency, North China, 5th: The North China Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army has issued an order to arrest the war criminal Liu Huanan and bring him to justice for the crimes committed by Liu Huanan's bandit troops of the Kuomintang army in looting the people of Baoding and destroying transportation, municipal administration, factories, schools, hospitals, etc. The original order is as follows:

It has been found that before the bandit leader Liu Huanan and his 272nd Division of the 101st Army of the Chiang bandits fled north from Baoding on November 22nd, the bandit leader Liu Huanan, knowing that the bandit group was about to be destroyed and that Baoding would forever belong to the people, dared to be enemies with the people to the end and frantically ordered his bandit troops to plunder the citizens of Baoding and public and private property, and to burn or destroy the buildings and equipment of Hebei University, the highest institution of learning in Hebei Province, the Army Hospital, the Electric Light Company, the Qianyi Flour Company, the Match Company, and important cultural, transportation, municipal, public and private enterprises such as railway stations. These crimes of bandit Liu completely violate the order issued by the General Headquarters of the People's Liberation Army on November 1st of this year to punish war criminals. Now, bandit leader Liu Huanan is hereby declared a war criminal, and all of the People's Liberation Army in North China is ordered to strictly arrest him in the future battles to completely annihilate the Chiang Kai-shek and Fu Zuoyi bandit troops in North China, bring him to justice, and not let the criminal escape. This order is imperative.
