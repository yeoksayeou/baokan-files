Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, December 24th: The Hague dispatch: The Dutch Communist Party's organ, on the 20th, vehemently protested against the Dutch government's aggression, stating, "This action has dragged the Dutch people into a great disaster." On the same day, Dutch Communist Party leader, Groot, during a parliamentary debate, presented a motion on the Indonesian issue, severely criticizing the Dutch government's despicable actions, and demanded an immediate ceasefire by the Dutch military.

According to TASS, Cairo: The Netherlands' new aggression against Indonesia has aroused sharp criticism from Egyptian newspapers. The "Al-Misri" newspaper wrote: Due to the patronage and support of American and British imperialists, the Netherlands has been preparing for this offensive for a long time. The newspaper pointed out that during the ceasefire, the United States and Britain supplied the Dutch army with various kinds of military equipment and ammunition. It was with their help that the Netherlands launched a new barbaric offensive. The actions of the Dutch colonial leaders are consistent with the plans of the United States and Britain to turn Indonesia into a colony and the Indonesian people into slaves.

　　荷共机关报大声疾呼
  　抗议政府卑鄙行动
    【新华社陕北二十四日电】海牙消息：荷兰共产党机关报二十日大声疾呼地抗议荷兰政府的侵略行为；指出“这种行动已把荷兰人民拖入了大灾难中”。同日、荷共领袖格罗特在国会辩论中，提出印尼问题的议案，严词评击荷政府的卑鄙行动。要求荷军立即停火。
    另据塔斯社开罗讯：荷兰对印尼的新侵略，引起了埃及各报的尖锐抨击。“阿米斯利”报写道：由于美英帝国主义者的赞助与支持，荷兰很久以来即在准备这一进攻。该报指出：在停战期间，美英曾供给荷军以各式的军备与军火。由于他们的帮助，荷兰才发动了新的野蛮的进攻。荷兰殖民头子的行动，与美英变印尼为殖民地及变印尼人民为奴隶的计划，是一致的。
