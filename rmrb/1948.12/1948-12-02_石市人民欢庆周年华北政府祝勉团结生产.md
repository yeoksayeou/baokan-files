　　[News from this newspaper] The North China People's Government sent a telegram congratulating Shijiazhuang City on the first anniversary of its liberation. The original text is as follows: To Mayor Ke of Shijiazhuang, and all comrades and compatriots in the city:
    We extend our boundless joy and warmly celebrate the first anniversary of the liberation of Shijiazhuang! We also pay tribute to you and the heroic and invincible People's Liberation Army that liberated Shijiazhuang!
    Over the past year, under the guidance of the correct policies of the Chinese Communist Party, you have striven to build a people's city, actively developed production, made Shijiazhuang increasingly prosperous and thriving, and supported the war, demonstrating great strength.
    Over the past year, all sectors of the city have united and worked hard. Although they have been subjected to brutal bombing by enemy planes, sabotage by treacherous spies, and two delusional attempts at a sneak attack by the Chiang, Yan, and Fu bandit gangs, all have been bravely crushed by our military and civilians. Shijiazhuang City will forever belong to the people.
    Now the war situation is developing rapidly towards national victory, and the liberation of all of North China is increasingly imminent. We hope that all comrades and compatriots in the city will unite more closely, work hard to develop production, strengthen anti-espionage and security work, actively join the army and participate in the war, and enthusiastically support the front lines to accelerate the arrival of victory!

    [News from this newspaper] Two hundred thousand citizens of Shijiazhuang joyfully and excitedly celebrated the first anniversary of the liberation of Shijiazhuang. They also celebrated the complete recovery of the Northeast, the 31st anniversary of the Soviet October Revolution, and the great victory in defending Shijiazhuang. The citizens called it "Four Blessings Arriving at Once." From the 12th to the 18th was "Victory Celebration Commemorative Week." The goods that were dispersed or fortified in shops during the war preparedness period once again filled the shelves, decorated with lanterns and colored hangings, just like celebrating the New Year. Various agencies installed all kinds of colored lights in front of their doors. The colored screen in front of the Municipal Government, which read "Serve the People Wholeheartedly," was made up of colored electric lights, illuminating like daylight at night. Citizens from various agencies, groups, schools, and the city's 22 streets prepared their own recreational programs. After dusk, various Yangko teams appeared on the streets, and propaganda floats shuttled back and forth. The photo wall in the People's Education Center, painted with the battle achievements of the People's Liberation Army, a large-scale map of the liberated areas, and photos of Shijiazhuang's construction, was surrounded by crowds. Workers worked with extraordinary effort to restore production and welcome their liberation festival. A certain machine weighed more than a thousand pounds, and several workers carried it back. The factory originally planned to restore its original state in two weeks, but it only took 24 hours. The Shijiazhuang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China sent a letter of congratulation. The factory planned to earn back the consumption of war preparedness in half a month. The telephone bureau originally planned to complete all restoration work before the anniversary of the liberation, but due to the workers' day and night processing, it was three days ahead of schedule. Workers in factories 301 and 302 are also contributing their utmost efforts to restore production. Many people immediately changed into brand-new worker's clothes and participated in Yangko teams and other cultural activities after finishing their work.

    十一月十二日
    【本报讯】石家庄二十万市民，欢欣兴奋的庆祝石市解放一周年。同时庆祝东北全境光复，庆祝苏联十月革命节三十一周年，庆祝保卫石市的伟大胜利，市民称之为“四喜临门”。从十二日至十八日为“庆祝胜利纪念周”，各商店在备战期间疏散或坚壁的物品又充满了货架，张灯结彩，和过新年一样。各机关门前装置了各式各样的彩灯，市府门前“全心全意为人民服务”的彩屏由各色电灯组成，入晚照耀如同白昼。各机关、团体、学校及市内二十二个街的市民，都准备了自己的游艺节目，黄昏以后，各秧歌队纷纷出现街头，宣传彩车不断穿梭而过。民教馆用两匹布绘成的人民解放军战绩图、大幅解放区形势图和石市建设照片展览的照壁前，人山人海。工人们以超人的努力恢复生产，迎接自己的解放节日。某种机器重千余斤，几个工人就抬回来了。该厂预定两星期恢复原状，结果只用了二十四小时，中共石市市委，特致函庆贺。这个厂准备以半月时间，挣回备战的消耗。电话局原定在解放周年纪念日前完成全部恢复工作，由于工人日夜加工，比原计划提早了三天。三○一、三○二等厂工人也在为恢复生产贡献自己最大的努方。许多人工作完了，立即换上崭新的工人装，参加秧歌队和其他的文娱活动。
