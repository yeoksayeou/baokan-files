　　Taiyue Formulates Specific Plans
  　Strive for a One-Inch Increase in Production Next Year
    Production Policy Prioritizes Agriculture and Supplements with Industry
    [Taiyue News] In order to prepare for next year's large-scale production movement in an organized and step-by-step manner, and to ensure the realization of Chairman Mao's call for "a one-inch increase in production," the Taiyue District Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a meeting of party committee secretaries and party group secretaries of the special commissioner's offices last month. It formulated the district's agricultural and industrial production plans for 1949. The meeting fully assessed the favorable conditions for carrying out next year's large-scale production movement: the thorough completion of land reform, the correction of certain deviations that were taking place, and the universal confirmation of land rights upon the conclusion of land reform this winter, which would raise the peasants' production enthusiasm to an unprecedented level. Secondly, the war is approaching its final victory, the masses' production is becoming increasingly stable, and the vast liberated areas are connected into one, which has opened up broad prospects for the development of industrial and agricultural production. Under these unprecedentedly favorable conditions, as long as there are practical plans and strong leadership, the goal of "a one-inch increase in production" can certainly be achieved. The plan stipulates:
    Ten Requirements for Agricultural Production:
    In terms of agricultural production: It is required to increase production by an average of 10%. Before the Anti-Japanese War, the average annual yield per mu was one dan (approximately 100 liters). After the Anti-Japanese War, due to the destruction of production conditions by the enemy, the average yield per mu dropped to 7.5 dou (approximately 75 liters). Next year, it is required to increase production by one dou per mu, with a total of 8.1 million mu of cultivated land in the district, requiring an increase of 810,000 dan of coarse grains. To achieve this goal, the following points must be met: First, increase agricultural implements. Due to the frantic destruction by the Japanese invaders and Chiang bandits, the existing agricultural implements are only about one-third of what they were before the Anti-Japanese War. This winter and next spring, strive to add 12,000 plows, 54,000 seeders, 19,000 hoes, 170,000 cultivators, and 38,000 manure baskets, reaching two-thirds of the pre-war level. Counties can set up iron and wood factories as needed to manufacture large quantities of major agricultural implements and lend or sell them to farmers. Farmers are also encouraged to raise funds to purchase small agricultural implements. Second, increase draught animals. There are currently 176,000 usable draught animals in the district. Two animals make up one team, and according to the total cultivated area of the district, each team cultivates an average of more than 90 mu, making it difficult to plow more and deeper. In addition to the existing 4,000 young animals that can start production next year, it is planned to purchase another 7,000, for a total increase of 11,000, which can strive to plow and harrow each mu more than this year. The government should find ways to purchase some from outside the district and sell or lend them to farmers. One hundred insemination stations will be set up throughout the district to breed extensively. Third, develop and improve labor mutual aid. In the old liberated areas with a considerable foundation of mutual aid, the mutual aid groups organized by administrative orders should be reformed or dissolved to overcome their formalism. The old areas are required to organize 50% of the labor force, and the semi-old areas are required to organize 20% to 30%. Implement the two major policies of equivalent value and voluntariness. Large and small sizes can be determined according to the needs of mass production and the strength of the leading cadres. Fourth, organize women in large numbers. According to the experience of organizing women to participate in agricultural production, two women can equal one full laborer. Next year, it is required to organize 200,000 women into agricultural production, which can increase 100,000 full laborers. In order to improve their production enthusiasm, in addition to clearly confirming their share on the land certificate, the family dividend system can be appropriately promoted. Strengthen women's technical learning, organize equal work for men and women in light and heavy work to avoid affecting their health. Fifth, increase fertilizer. In recent years, the average amount of fertilizer applied per mu in the district has been about 25 dan, which is about half of the pre-war level. Next year, it is required to increase by 20%. In the cotton and bean producing areas of northern Henan plain, develop oil mills to produce more oil cake, and in the mountainous areas, promote cutting wormwood to smoke manure. At present, it is especially necessary to use all conditions to prepare a large amount of natural fertilizer. Sixth, cultivate intensively. The number of plowing and harrowing of the land is less than before the war. Efforts should be made to reach the pre-war level next year. Seventh, repair borders and build embankments. In recent years, many land borders and embankments have collapsed, which has greatly affected production in mountainous areas. Strive to repair all of them next year. Eighth, eliminate wasteland. Strive to eliminate all new wasteland, and gradually eliminate old wasteland as conditions permit. Ninth, improve farming techniques. Each county should set up agricultural experiment stations and technical guidance committees to guide the masses in selecting seeds, disinfecting, improving agricultural implements, and preventing and controlling diseases and insect pests. Tenth, focus on water conservancy projects, build and repair canals in northern Henan and along the Tongpu Railway, and add waterwheels. Mountainous areas should pay attention to flood control and land protection.
    In terms of sideline production: Strive to increase to one pig per three households and one chicken per two people next year, and reach the 1946 level for silkworm rearing, producing 160,000 jin of cocoons. In textile industry, special attention should be paid to improving tools and improving technology. Taiyue textile industry has a long history, but the technology is relatively backward. With the import of foreign cloth, the profit of textile industry is not high at present. Promoting the improvement of tools and technology can still achieve the goal of self-weaving and self-wearing. Flour mills and oil mills are required to double.
    Industrial Production Focuses on Coal and Iron Industries
    In terms of industrial production: Taiyue is rich in coal and iron resources. After the Anti-Japanese War, it was destroyed by the Japanese and Chiang, and the output decreased greatly. According to incomplete statistics from ten counties before the war, the annual coal production was about 1 million tons, but now the output is only about one-third to one-half of the pre-war level. Next year, it is required to restore to 60% of the pre-war level. Taiyue iron products were sold in several provinces north and south of the Yellow River before the war, but now the output is about one-fourth of the pre-war level. Next year, the number of iron furnaces should strive to reach 30% to 35% of the pre-war level, and the output should reach 40%. Special attention should be paid to the development of frying furnaces and square bricks to increase the production of raw materials. The paper industry has now exceeded the pre-war level. Next year, the number of paper-making pools is required to reach 119% of the pre-war level, and the output should reach 121%. In order to ensure the supply of raw materials, it is advocated to plant mulberry forests extensively. In terms of methods: It is advocated to organize handicraft workers' production mutual aid to improve production efficiency and technology. Solve the problem of tool difficulties, and use simple machines as much as possible. For example, changing the bellows of iron furnaces to windmills can increase the wind power by five times; using pulping machines for paper making can save a lot of labor. Organize various guilds (such as coal guilds, iron goods guilds, and grain guilds) to sell finished products in a planned way and reduce the exploitation of middlemen. Handle trademark registration to avoid shoddy products.
    There are currently more than 20,000 cooperatives in the district, almost every village has a cooperative. Some cooperatives have problems with their business policies and management, which has caused dissatisfaction among the masses and even led to their collapse. This winter, they should be vigorously rectified. Business management should adopt democratic centralism, with the members' congress as the highest authority, and managers and employees should also have responsibilities and powers.
    In terms of the overall production policy, agriculture is generally the main focus and industry is the auxiliary, but different regions can determine different priorities according to specific conditions. The Fourth Special District should give equal importance to agriculture and industry. When formulating plans, each county needs to determine specific priorities.

　　太岳制订具体计划
  　争取明年生产长一寸
    生产方针以农业为主工业为辅
    【太岳讯】为了有组织有步骤的准备明年大生产运动，保证作到毛主席“生产长一寸”的号召，中共太岳区党委于上月召开党的地委书记和专署的党组书记会议，制订了一九四九年全区农业和工业的生产计划。会议充分估计了开展明年大生产运动的有利条件：即土改彻底完成，某些偏向已经与正在纠正，今冬结束土改是普遍确定了地权，农民生产情绪空前提高。其次，战争已接近最后胜利，群众生产日益安定，广大解放区联成一片，给发展工农业生产开阔了广阔的前途。在这些空前有利的条件下，只要切合实际的计划与坚强的领导，一定能达到“生产长一寸”的目的。该计划规定：
    农业生产的十大要求：
    农业生产方面：要求普遍增产一成。太岳抗战以前的常年产量每亩平均一石。抗日战争以后，因生产条件受敌破坏每亩平均降为七斗五升。明年要求每亩增产一斗，全区耕地八百一十万亩，要求增产八十一万石粗粮。为达此目的，必须作到以下几点：第一、增加农具。由于日寇蒋匪疯狂的破坏，现有农具相当抗战前三分之一。今冬明春争取增添犁一万二千张、耧五万四千架、铣一万九千把、锄十七万把、粪筐三万八千付，达到抗战前三分之二。各县可按需要开设铁木工厂，大量制造主要农具，贷给或卖给农民。并号召农民集资购置小农具。第二、增加耕畜。全区现有能用耕畜十七万六千头，两个牲口合成一犋，按全区耕地面积计算，每犋平均耕地九十余亩，很难作到耕多犁深。明年除现有的四千头小畜可以开始生产外，计划再购入七千头，共增一万一千头，可争取每亩地较今年多犁耙一遍。政府当设法从外区购入一部，卖给或贷予农民。全区再设一百个配种所，大量繁殖。第三、发展与提高劳动互助。过去互助已有相当基础的老区，对于行政命令组织起来的互助组，予以改造或解散，克服其形式主义。老区要求组织劳力百分之五十，半老区组织百分之廿到卅。贯彻等价自愿两大政策。大型、小型可根据群众生产的需要和领导骨干的强弱等条件决定。第四、大量组织妇女。根据组织妇女参加农业生产的经验，两个妇女可顶一个全劳力。明年要求组织二十万个妇女到农业生产中，即可增加十万个全劳力。为提高她们的生产情绪，除在土地证上明确肯定其分得一份外，可适当提倡家庭分红制度。加强妇女的技术学习，组织与男人在轻重活上的等价拨工，以免影响她们的身体。第五、增加肥料。近几年来，全区平均每亩施肥二十五担左右，约当战前的一半。明年要求增加二成。在豫北平原产棉、豆区，发展油坊多产油饼，山区提倡割蒿薰粪。目前特别要利用一切条件，大量准备天然肥料。第六、精耕细作。现在土地犁耙的较战前减少一遍，明年要设法达到抗战前水平。第七、修边垒堰。近年土地边堰坍地甚多，山地影响生产很大。争取明年全部修好。第八、消灭荒地。新荒争取全部消灭，老荒视情况许可逐步消灭。第九、改良农作技术。各县设农业试验场和技术指导委员会，领导群众选种、消毒、改良农具、防治病虫害。第十、有重点的兴修水利，在豫北及同蒲沿线，开修渠道，增置水车。山地区注意防洪保地。
    副业生产方面：明年争取增加到三户一猪，两人一鸡，养蚕达到一九四六年的水平，产茧十六万斤。纺织要特别注意改良工具，提高技术。太岳纺织有悠久历史，但技术比较落后，外布输入，目前纺织利润不大。提倡改良工具、提高技术，仍可达到自织自穿的目的。粉坊、油坊要求增加一倍。
    工业生产以煤铁业为主
    工业生产方面：太岳盛产煤铁，抗战后遭受日蒋破坏，产量大减。据战前十个县不完全的统计，每年产煤约一百万吨，现在产量仅约当战前三分之一到二分之一。明年要求恢复到抗战前百分之六十。太岳铁货战前行销黄河南北数省，现在产量约为抗战前的四之一。明年铁炉数争取达到抗战前百分之三十到三十五，产量达到百分之四十。尤应注意发展炒炉、方砖，增产原料。纸业现已超过战前水平，明年造纸池数要求达到战前百分一百一十九，产量达到百分之一百二十一。为保证原料供应，提倡广植桑林。在方法上：提倡组织手工业者的生产互助，以提高生产效率和技术。解决工具困难，尽可能使用简单机器，如铁炉的风箱改为风车，可提高风力五倍；造纸使用打料机，可节省许多人工。组织各种行栈（如煤栈、铁货栈、花粮栈），有计划地推销成品，减少奸商中间剥削。办理商标登记，以免粗制滥造。
    合作社，现全区共有二万余所，几乎村村有社，有些合作社的业务方针和经营管理有毛病，群众不满，甚至垮了，今冬应大力整顿。经营管理应采取民主集中制，社员大会为最高权力机关，经理职员也应有职有权。
    在总的生产方针上，一般以农业为主，工业为辅，但各地可根据具体条件。决定不同重点。四专区则农工业并重。各县在制定计划时，更需确定具体的重点。
