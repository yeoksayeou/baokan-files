Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 27th -- The Zhengzhou Municipal People's Government has organized the poor to engage in production activities such as shoemaking, resolving the livelihood difficulties of some of the impoverished. Prior to organizing production, the People's Government first allocated 10,000 sets of old cotton clothing and 300 dan (approx. 30,000 kg) of grain as relief and production subsidies. The trade company then established branch stores in the three administrative districts, allocating 3,000 bolts of cloth for women to make shoes. Currently, the second and third districts have formed 120 shoemaking groups, with over 1,500 women making shoes. In the third district, 540 women are participating in making shoe soles, producing 13,886 shoe sole linings daily. The newly established Yu Min Shoe Factory in the second district has 825 women participating in shoemaking. The impoverished Yang Feng and her daughter pasted 148 shoe sole linings in four days, earning a net profit of 325 Zhongzhou currency (local currency), after deducting the cost of paste, averaging over 80 yuan per day, which is enough to maintain their livelihood. In the first district, over 120 women in the sixth street have completed 198 pairs of shoes. To supply the needs for shoemaking, women in the eighth and third streets of the first district are participating in spinning hemp thread. Each lane in the eighth street can spin 150 jin (approx. 75 kg) of thread per day, with each person spinning 3 jin of thread. After deducting the cost, each person can earn a profit of around 80 yuan. In order to organize more of the impoverished to participate in production and to systematically unify the procurement of raw materials and the promotion of finished products, the municipal government is planning to establish production promotion societies in each district to further seek welfare for the impoverished.

    【新华社郑州二十七日电】郑州市人民政府，组织贫民进行做鞋等生产，解决了部分贫民的生活困难。在组织生产之前，人民政府先确定以旧棉衣一万套、粮食三百市担作为救济与生产补助金，并由贸易公司在三个行政区分设门市部，拨三千匹布发给妇女们做鞋。现二、三区已组成一百二十个做鞋小组，做鞋妇女达一千五百余人。三区参加做鞋底的妇女已有五百四十名，每天能糊鞋底料一万三千八百八十六张。二区新成立的豫民鞋厂，有八百二十五名妇女参加做鞋。贫民杨冯氏和他的女儿四天糊了一百四十八张鞋底料，除去浆糊费，净得中州币三百二十五元，平均每天可得八十多元，已可维持生活。一区六街一百二十余妇女，已完成鞋子一百九十八双。为供给做鞋需要，一区八街和三街妇女都参加纺麻线。八街的一个闾每天能纺线一百五十斤，每人能纺线三斤，除本钱外，每人可得利八十元左右。市府为组织更多贫民参加生产及有计划的统一采购原料和推销成品，现拟在各区设立生产推进社，进一步为贫民谋福利。
