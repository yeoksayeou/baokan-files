Taihang Electric: To commend and encourage the militia and self-defense forces to actively participate in the war and support the front, the Taihang Administrative Office and the Military Region's People's Armed Forces Department recently announced the revised draft of the Taihang Militia and Self-Defense Force Reward Measures. The draft first states: All militia and self-defense forces that independently fight and cooperate with the army in combat, participation in the war, and support for the front, undertaking battlefield services, and achieving important results in completing tasks, or in a combat state, actively protecting all factories, shops, warehouses, railways, mines, schools, barracks, hospitals, and public buildings and materials such as places of scenic or historical interest, and maintaining order with achievements, whether individual or collective, should be reported to the higher-level government and the armed forces department, and be given honorary and material rewards according to the size of the achievement. Subsequently, the measures for the treatment of spoils seized by the militia and self-defense forces in combat are stipulated: (1) All important documents, light and heavy artillery, radio stations, telephone exchanges and other important military materials and weapons that the militia cannot use, seized in independent combat, should be handed over to the higher-level armed forces department for rewards. (2) All enemy's massive baggage and materials seized in combat, such as large quantities of food and clothing, etc., must be handed over to the higher-level government and the armed forces department, and 20% to 50% of the rewards will be given to the unit or individual who seized them, and the remainder will be handed over to the higher-level government and the armed forces department. All livestock and property seized from the people by the enemy will be returned to the original owners after identification by the original owners, and the owners of the livestock will give appropriate feed costs; (3) All other firearms, ammunition and other military items, if seized by the militia, should belong to the militia (items obtained by individuals shall be used by the individual and must be handed over to the militia team when dismissed, and shall not be privately possessed; items obtained by the collective shall belong to the collective). No organization or individual may forcibly occupy or confiscate them; however, if the quantity obtained is too large, it should belong to the higher-level armed forces department, and 10% to 30% will be given to the seizing unit and individual as a reward, and the remainder will be handled uniformly by the higher-level armed forces department. (4) When the army annihilates the enemy and continues to pursue the spoils left on the battlefield, when the militia and self-defense forces cooperate in cleaning the battlefield, the spoils shall be distributed by the army. (5) All rewards given to individuals or collectives by the army or higher authorities shall not be deemed illegal or confiscated by anyone, but the weapons awarded to individuals must be registered and shall not be sold or lent.
