Xinhua News Agency, Linfen, 7th: The famous Lu Salt of Yuncheng, Shanxi Province, is rapidly recovering production with the assistance of the Jin-South Democratic Government. The Yuncheng Salt Lake is located east of Yuncheng, at the northern foot of the Zhongtiao Mountains, extending 57 li from east to west and 10 li from north to south. The entire lake is divided into three fields: East, Central, and West. The salt layer in the East Field is several feet thick, commonly known as the "salt root," and produces the most salt. The Central Field is second, and the West Field produces the least. The produced salt is sold in Shanxi, Shaanxi, and Henan provinces, making it a major resource in southern Shanxi. During the Republic of China years 17 and 18 (1928-1929), the salt field had more than 6,000 workers, with an annual production of 280 million catties of salt. During the period of Japanese puppet rule, the "people produce, officials transport, officials sell" method was implemented, and wheat and coal seized from farmers were used to "exchange materials for salt" with salt merchants, raising the prices of wheat and coal while lowering the price of salt. As a result, Lu Salt production plummeted. The entire lake had a historical salt reserve of 8,000 ming (each ming being 40,000 catties), of which 7,000 ming were plundered by the Japanese invaders. After the Japanese surrender, the extortion of the Kuomintang reactionary government was even worse than that of the Japanese invaders, leading to the closure of salt fields and an annual salt production of only 300 ming. After Yuncheng was liberated in February this year, the Democratic Government established the Lu Salt Administration Bureau to actively assist the salt fields in resuming production, issuing short-term credit loans of 1.2 billion yuan (Jire currency), and the workshops started operating one after another. There are currently 37 salt fields with more than 3,900 salt workers. Eleven new salt fields are also being prepared for commencement. The Democratic Government also organized the Salt Lake Workers' Union, on the one hand improving the lives of workers, abolishing the salt field owners' deduction of wages for weather days (i.e., lost work due to wind and rain) and the practice of withholding wages, and implementing a new system of paying wages on a monthly basis, increasing the enthusiasm of workers. Therefore, salt production has been continuously increasing. The entire lake has completed the production plan of 2,000 ming of salt set by the Democratic Government this year. The Labor Model Conference held in the middle of last month plans to increase production to 3,300 ming next year.

　　加强领导改善职工生活
  　运城潞盐生产迅速恢复
    【新华社临汾七日电】著名的山西运城潞盐，在晋南民主政府的扶助下，正迅速恢复生产中。运城盐池位于运城以东之中条山北麓，东西长五十七里，南北宽十里。全池分东、中、西三场，东场盐层厚达数尺，俗称“盐根”，产盐最多；中场次之，西场较少。所产的盐销行山西、陕西、河南三省，为晋南一大富源。民国十七、八年，盐场共有工人六千余，年产盐二亿八千万斤。日伪统治时期，实行“民产、官运、官销”办法，并以从农民手中抢来的麦、煤与盐商实行“物资换盐”，提高麦、炭价，压低盐价。潞盐产量因此一落千丈。全池历年存盐八千铭（每铭四万斤），被日寇掠夺七千铭。日寇投降后，国民党反动政府的勒索更甚于日寇，以致盐场纷纷歇业，全年出盐仅三百铭。今年二月运城解放后，民主政府成立潞盐管理局，积极帮助盐场恢复生产，发放短期信用贷款十二亿元（冀币），工场纷纷开工。现有盐场三十七家，盐工三千九百余人。尚有十一家新盐场正筹备开工。民主政府并组织了盐池职工会，一方面改善职工生活，废除了盐场主扣风雨工（即刮风下雨时误工），和扣压工资的办法，实行按月发工资的新制度，提高职工的积极性，因此盐产量不断提高。全池今年已完成了民主政府提出的产盐二千铭的生产计划。上月中旬召开的劳动模范大会，计划明年提高产量到三千三百铭。
