Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, December 11th: TASS reports: The acting Soviet Commander in Berlin, Ilizarov, and the Mayor of the Provisional Government of Greater Berlin, Ebert, simultaneously issued statements on the 7th, declaring the sham election in West Berlin completely invalid. Ilizarov's statement said: "The election held in the Western districts of Berlin on December 5th aimed to divide Berlin, establish special administrative institutions, and encourage undemocratic and reactionary elements in the Western districts. The election was neither democratic nor free. Its nature and procedures violated the Provisional Constitution and election regulations of Berlin. The election was held under the illegal prohibition of democratic mass organizations. Democratic groups that opposed the divisive election were subjected to persecution and police terror. According to preliminary materials, 491 members of democratic mass organizations were arrested, the majority of whom were male and female members of the 'Free German Youth League.' On the day of the election, more than 100 people were arrested for posting and distributing slogans and leaflets from democratic groups calling for a boycott of the election. This terror was perpetrated by German and non-German officials in the Western districts, who not only threatened the people with retaliation but also paraded tanks and troops in the streets as a demonstration. The purpose of the December 5th election was to divide Berlin and replace a unified election for all of Berlin. The Soviet occupation authorities' proposal of October 20th to hold unified elections was rejected. The results of the divisive municipal election published in the Western district newspapers are a clumsy fabrication. Official figures greatly exaggerated the number of voters, while the number of invalid votes was minimized. In view of the above, the Soviet Military Administration in Berlin considers the election held in the Western districts of Berlin on December 5th to be unconstitutional and its results completely invalid." Ebert, in an extraordinary meeting of the Provisional Municipal Committee, issued a statement pointing out that the West Berlin election was completely unconstitutional and undemocratic. Ebert solemnly declared that this election cannot be considered valid.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, December 9th: TASS was instructed to publish a statement on December 3rd stating: Regarding the proposal by the Argentine Foreign Minister Bramuglia to establish a six-nation financial and monetary expert committee, the Soviet side notified Bramuglia on November 29th that this was a matter to be resolved by representatives of the six nations, and pointed out that if such a committee were established, the Soviet side could provide it with the necessary information. Regarding the Soviet Union's attitude towards other proposals related to the Berlin issue put forward by Bramuglia in recent days, it is based on the Soviet position clarified by Vyshinsky during the Security Council's discussion of the Berlin issue. It should be pointed out that the proposal to establish a so-called "conciliation committee" is unlikely to achieve any progress. The first part of the TASS statement elaborates in detail the Soviet position on the issues mentioned in the memorandum of the US, British, and French governments in response to Bramuglia's five questions, which have not yet been resolved. The main points are: The Four-Power Finance Committee shall implement control over measures concerning the East Zone mark as the sole currency in Berlin; the number of Berlin currency and credit issued for the entire city, in addition to that already in circulation, the initial number shall be determined by the number of "B" marks exchanged in accordance with the agreement, and the subsequent number issued shall be determined by the Four-Power Finance Committee; the establishment of a Berlin office of the German Issuing Bank in the Soviet Zone, which, under the supervision of the Finance Committee, shall implement Berlin's financial and credit policies in accordance with the Four-Power agreement; the Finance Committee shall issue import and export licenses for Berlin.

    柏林苏军司令声明西区伪选完全无效
    【新华社陕北十一日电】塔斯社讯：柏林苏军代理司令伊利萨洛夫及大柏林临时政府市长艾伯特，于七日同时发表声明，宣布西柏林的伪选完全无效。伊利萨洛夫声明称：“柏林西区十二月五日举行的选举，其目的是在分裂柏林，建立特殊行政机构，鼓励西区的非民主分子和反动分子，选举绝非民主或自由的。它的性质与程序均违反了柏林临时宪法和选举条例。选举是在非法禁止民主群众团体的情况下举行的。曾进行反对分裂选举的民主团体，被置诸迫害与警察恐怖之下。据初步材料，民主群众组织的成员，有四百九十一人被捕，其中大多数为‘自由德国青年联盟’的男女盟员。在选举之日，因为张贴和散布民主团体号召抵制选举的标语与传单而被捕者数在百人以上。这种恐怖是西区德籍的与非德籍的官员们所作的。他们除以报复威胁人民外，并以坦克和部队巡街示威。十二月五日选举的目的，是在分裂柏林，而且代替了全柏林统一的选举。苏联占领当局于十月二十日提出之举行统一选举的建议遭到了拒绝。西区报纸上所公布的分裂市选的结果，是一个拙劣的伪造。官方的数字大大地夸张了投票者的人数，而废票的数字则被减少到最小。由上所述，苏军柏林司令部认为柏林西区十二月五日所举行的选举为不合宪法的，其结果完全无效。”艾伯特在临时市政委员会非常会议上发表声明，指出西柏林选举完全不合宪法和不民主。艾氏郑重声明，这一选举不能认为有效。
    【新华社陕北九日电】塔斯社十二月三日奉命发表声明称：关于阿根廷外长布拉玛葛利亚设立六国财政金融专家委员会的建议，苏联方面在十一月二十九日业已通知布氏，这是应由六国代表解决的问题，并曾指出，如果建立了此种委员会，则苏联方面可以供给其以必要的情报。关于苏联对布氏若干日来提出的有关柏林问题之其他建议的态度，则以维辛斯基在安理会讨论柏林问题时所阐明的苏方立场为依据。应当指出的是：建立所谓“调解委员会”的建议，很难获致任何进展。塔斯社声明的前半部，对现在尚未解决而为美英法三国在答复布拉玛葛利亚五个问题的备忘录中所提及的问题，详细地阐明苏方的立场，其要点为：由四国金融委员会执行对有关苏占区马克作为柏林唯一通货之措施的管制；全柏林通货与信用的发行数目，除现已流通者外，第一批的数目，应决定于依照协议兑换的“Ｂ”记马克的数目，以后的发行数目，则由四国金融委员会决定之；建立苏占区的德国发行银行柏林办事处，在金融委员会的监督下，根据四国协议，执行柏林的金融和信用政策；由金融委员会颁发柏林进出口的许可证。
