　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, December 27th: Free Greece Radio broadcast: The Greek Provisional Democratic Government recently issued a statement on the occasion of its first anniversary, stating: On December 23, 1947, all the Greek people welcomed the establishment of the Provisional Democratic Government with heartfelt joy. In the past year, the Athens clique has sunk deeper into the mire of betrayal, while the people's struggle has grown ever wider. Today, the royalist fascists no longer dare to boast about "swiftly annihilating the guerrillas." They cannot conceal their fear of the Democratic Army. The statement emphasized: The heroism of the Democratic Army throughout Greece, and the great victory recently won by the Democratic Army in the city of Karditsa, prove the invincible power of the Democratic Army. The key to the Democratic Army's strength lies in the fact that it is fighting for a just cause, for the freedom and independence of Greece; it lies in the fact that it is under the leadership of a genuine Greek government. Free Greece Radio also broadcast on the occasion of the second anniversary of the establishment of the Democratic Army headquarters in the Peloponnese, stating: The Democratic Army in the Peloponnese has achieved significant victories in its two years of operations against the royalist fascists. Large areas of the peninsula have been liberated from royalist fascist rule. Currently, the liberated areas of the Peloponnese have a population of 300,000, and people's committees have been established in 300 towns and villages.

　　希腊人民以战斗和胜利庆祝民主政府成立周年
    【新华社陕北二十七日电】自由希腊电台广播：希腊临时民主政府顷发表其成立一周年的文告称：一九四七年十二月二十三日，全希腊人民曾怀着衷心喜悦的心情，迎接临时民主政府的成立。过去一年内，雅典集团已经更深地陷入卖国的泥坑，而人民的斗争却越来越扩大了。今天，保皇法西斯分子已不敢再夸口“迅速歼灭游击队”了。他们无法掩饰他们对民主军的恐惧。文告着重指出：遍于全希腊的民主军的英雄主义，以及民主军最近在卡迪柴城所获得的伟大胜利，证明了民主军的不可征服的威力。民主军获得力量的关键，在于它是在为正义事业、为希腊的自由和独立而战斗；在于它是在真正的希腊政府领导下。自由希腊电台又于民主军在摩里亚半岛司令部成立两周年时广播称：摩里亚半岛民主军在对保皇法西斯的两年作战中，已获得重大胜利。该半岛的大块地区，已从保皇法西斯统治下获得解放。目前，摩里亚半岛的解放区共有三十万人口，在三百个城镇和乡村中已设立了人民委员会。
