　　Ten Thousand Li of Conquest Along the Great Wall Line
    Zhang Fan
    In March of this year, this reporter followed the army from Dingxian County, Hebei, through western Hebei and northern Shanxi, across the Great Wall, on a westward expedition to Suiyuan. After completing the mission, we turned back to southern Chahar, and then followed another unit to climb the mountains of western Hebei, crossed the Ping-Sui Railway again, went beyond the Great Wall again, and arrived in eastern Hebei via northern Chahar, western Jehol, and southern Jehol. After the Autumn Offensive, we turned back to northern Chahar again, fighting on the Ping-Zhang section. This unit has been on the march for eight months since its departure, traversing over nine thousand li inside and outside the Great Wall. In the long marches, across thousands of mountains and rivers, we overcame countless difficulties and experienced severe tests. In the windy and sandy border regions, inside and outside the ancient Great Wall, and along the coast of the Bohai Sea, we conducted highly mobile operations—often fighting here and then there, achieving major victories in the campaigns of southern Chahar, western Jehol, eastern Hebei, and the Ping-Zhang section.
    In the southern Chahar campaign, we opened up a new battlefield, annihilating more than 30,000 of Fu Zuoyi's troops, accounting for one-twelfth of his total strength; liberating 900,000 people in southern Chahar, and cutting off Bo bandits' sources of troops and grain.
    In the western Jehol campaign, we captured Fengning, Luanping, Anjiangtun and other places on the Chengping Road, liberating vast areas of western Jehol, coordinating with the offensive of fraternal units, and turning Chengde into a landlocked island.
    In the eastern Hebei campaign, we conducted highly mobile operations, capturing Changli, Fengrun, Sanhe, Xianghe, Wuqing and other cities, cutting off the Beining Railway, the "Northeast Corridor" highly valued by the Chiang bandits, and the Ping-Gu Railway, the "Jehol Corridor", annihilating more than 10,000 enemies, and containing Fu bandits' main force, "placing Fu bandits in a situation of being stretched to the left and right" (Central Committee congratulatory telegram), enabling our army on the Ping-Bao front to achieve major victories in capturing several cities in succession, annihilating more than 10,000 enemies, and isolating Baoding.
    In the Ping-Zhang section campaign, we shouldered the strategic containment task on the northern front, annihilating more than 15,000 Fu bandits, liberating vast areas of northern Chahar, containing Fu bandits' main force on the Ping-Zhang section, and coordinating with the offensive of our army in Suiyuan and the operations of our army in the Northeast.
    In these eight months of "expedition" and battle, our unit has made great progress, laid a solid foundation in the concept of field operations, significantly improved the unit's marching ability, and made great progress in tactics and policy discipline. Naturally, this still needs to be improved in order to quickly fulfill the expectations of the Party and the people—to liberate all of China as soon as possible.
    (I) Eagerness for the Expedition
    In March of this year, after the troops underwent the Three Checks and Vent Grievances and the New-Style Soldier Training Movement, their class consciousness was greatly enhanced and their morale was extremely high. Many units and individuals wrote letters to their leaders requesting to fight. After the expedition order was issued, many comrades made plans to achieve meritorious service, guaranteeing that they would not be afraid of long journeys or tough battles, would abide by discipline and obey orders, and some units held oath-taking rallies, vowing to complete the glorious tasks given by the Party and the people.
    The soldiers of the Sixth Company of the Sixth Battalion were overjoyed when they heard that they were going on an expedition. They wrote many gun poems, writing on the revolving machine gun: "Revolving gun, revolving gun, you once helped the Chiang bandits to oppose the people, and you only turned over in the Nangoutou battle; this time you must show your power in battle, and everyone will praise you for your meritorious service."
    Writing on the grenade launcher: "Grenade launcher, grenade launcher, you have not achieved meritorious service in my hands, this time you must exert your full strength to blow up all the enemy's fortresses, and I will achieve meritorious service in the battle, and the soldiers will praise you in the newspaper!"
    Writing on the Type 38 rifle: "Type 38 rifle, you were stubbornly strong in the Xiangjiazhuang battle, this time help me capture Bo Zuoyi, and our names will be known all over the world!"
    Writing on the cooking squad's oil barrel: "Sesame oil barrel, sesame oil barrel, sesame oil makes the dishes delicious and exquisite, comrades, eat more bowls of rice heartily, kill more enemies and achieve more meritorious service; go up the mountains and down the mountains with light steps, be careful and don't break the sesame oil barrel."
    Pasted on the rice bag: "Millet grains are round and round, I tell my partner the cook, this time we must not fall behind in the battle: first, wash me several times, and don't leave a grain of sand; second, be careful when burning the fire, and don't burn or smoke; third, cover the pad well and don't let the air escape, and don't let us eat raw rice, not soft and not hard, fragrant and fragrant, the comrades will never forget us when they kill the enemy and achieve meritorious service!"
    On the day of departure, the men, women, old and young in the village surrounded us, shouting slogans to send us on the expedition to Chahar and Suiyuan. We crossed the Tanghe River and the Shahe River, traveled west from Fuping, and the agencies along the way had prepared houses for us in advance. The honor guard of the military region enthusiastically played the Eighth Route Army March for us at Wanglinkou. The elders of Wanglinkou sent us cigarettes, dates and peanuts to comfort us while we were resting, and also wrote extremely enthusiastic farewell letters.
    (II) Forcibly Crossing the Sanggan River
    After the expeditionary troops arrived in southern Chahar and northern Yanbei, what lay before them was the Sanggan River. This is a medium-sized river, only one and a half li wide in places where the riverbed is wide. In summer, the water is several feet deep and can be crossed on foot; in winter, it freezes into a thick layer of ice, and large vehicles can travel smoothly. However, in spring, especially around the Qingming Festival, the ice melts and the water is cold, and ice floes the size of tables flow down with the waves, tumbling and impacting, making it extremely difficult to build bridges, let alone the quicksand at the bottom of the river! We used great effort to build iron chain bridges and wooden horse bridges under enemy strafing and bombing. The engineers and sailors wearing cowhide pants worked hard in the icy river to build some bridges for our expeditionary army. However, because there were many troops and the combat mission was urgent, many troops waded across this icy river.
    Comrade Qingxiang, a reporter who followed the artillery, said: When crossing the river, everyone gasped in unison as soon as they entered the water. After taking a few steps, everyone felt that their lower limbs did not belong to them. The mules relied on human support, and the people relied on the strength of the horses to prevent being washed away by the water. But as soon as half of the way was crossed, some of the mules carrying artillery were washed away by the water, and some of the mules were tripped over by the rocks. When the company commander of a certain company saw this, he jumped into the icy river without taking off his cotton-padded clothes to direct everyone to rescue the mules. He said, "This is the time to achieve meritorious service!" So, many people jumped into the water. In order to find ammunition, some comrades disregarded the wounds cut by the ice and bled, and crossed back and forth several times in the biting icy river. As soon as Second Platoon Leader Li Yuqi got ashore, he asked everyone to check the equipment, but he couldn't say a word. The soldiers helped him put on his clothes and helped him to the village to keep warm. He was originally very weak, but due to his revolutionary sense of responsibility, he had to persevere in the icy water to complete the combat mission. The soldiers described the situation of the icy river at that time: "The teeth clattered, the whole body trembled, the legs were frozen and I don't know how thick, the feet I don't know how big, stepping on the ground seemed to be in the air, soft and weak, I don't know where I was stepping." The horses carrying artillery also shivered as soon as they came out of the water. The water flowing from their bodies formed half-foot-long icicles on their bellies, and the tails that usually swayed were frozen into long icicles that could not move.
    This kind of hardship cannot stop the people's warriors with a high degree of class consciousness, and no difficulty can stop them.

　　万里征战长城线
    张帆
    今年三月，记者随军由河北定县出发，经冀西、晋北，越长城，西征绥远；任务完后，折回察南，又随另支部队爬过平西之山区，北越平绥路，再出长城，经察北、热西、热南而抵达冀东。秋季攻势后，再折回察北，战斗于平张段上。这支部队自出征至今，历时八月，转战于长城内外，已达九千余里。在长途跋涉，千山万水间，我们战胜了无数的困难，经历了严重的考验；在风沙的塞外，在古老的长城内外，在渤海之滨，我们进行了高度的机动作战——这经常是打完这里打那里，取得了察南、热西、冀东、平张段诸战役的重大胜利。
    察南战役，我们开辟了新战场，歼灭了傅作义三万余人，占其总兵力的十二分之一；解放了察南九十万人民，切断了博匪兵源粮源。
    热西战役，我们攻克了承平路上的丰宁、滦平、安匠屯等地，解放了热西广大地区，配合了兄弟部队的攻势，使承德成为陆上孤岛。
    冀东战役，我们高度机动作战，攻克了昌黎、丰润、三河、香河、武清等城，切断了蒋匪极其重视的“东北走廊”北宁路及“热河走廊”平古路，歼灭了一万多敌人，箝制了傅匪主力，“陷傅匪于左支右绌之境”（中央贺电），使平保前线我军取得连克数城、歼敌万余、孤立保定的重大胜利。
    平张段战役，我们担负了北线的战略箝制队，歼灭了傅匪一万五千余人，解放了察北广大地区，箝制了傅匪主力部队于平张段上，配合了绥远我军的攻势与东北我军的作战。
    在这八个月的“出征”转战中，我们这支部队获得了很大进步，在野战化思想方面打下了巩固的基础，部队的行军力有了显著的提高，在战术和政策纪律方面也有了很大的进步。自然，这还须提高一步，以便迅速完成党和人民的期望——早日解放全中国。
    （一）出征的热望
    今年三月，部队经过了三查诉苦新式兵练兵运动后，阶级觉悟大大提高，士气极为旺盛，许多单位及个人写信给首长要求作战。出征命令下达后，许多同志订立了立功计划，保证不怕走远路，不怕打硬仗，遵守纪律，服从命令，有的单位举行了誓师大会，宣誓完成党和人民所给的光荣任务。
    六一部六连的战士们，听说要出征，高兴的不行，编写了许多枪杆诗，在转盘机枪上写着：“转盘转盘，你曾帮过蒋贼把人民反，南沟头战斗才把身翻；这次战斗你要把威风显，立了功劳，人人都把你称赞。”
    在掷弹筒上写着：“掷弹筒掷弹筒，你没在我手里立过功，这次你要蹩足劲，把敌人堡垒全炸平，战斗下来我立功，子弟兵报上你显扬！”
    在三八枪上写：“三八枪，向家庄战斗你逞顽强，这次帮我捉住博作义，咱俩名儿天下扬！”
    炊事班油筒上写：“香油筒香油筒，香油做出菜来好又精，同志们痛快多吃碗饭，多杀敌人多立功；上山下山轻迈步，小心谨慎可别碰坏香油筒。”
    米袋子上贴着：“小米粒圆又圆，我告俺伙伴炊事员，这次打仗咱别落了后：第一把我多掏几个遍，一颗砂子也不留；第二烧火要小心，可别糊了串了烟；第三盖垫盖好别走了气，千万别叫吃生饭，不软不硬喷喷香，同志们杀敌立了功，一定会忘不了咱！”
    出发的这一天，村中的男女老幼都围着我们，呼着口号欢送我们出征察绥。我们渡过唐河、沙河，由阜平西行，沿途的机关都预先给我们誊好了房子，军区的仪仗队在王林口给我们热烈的奏着八路军进行曲。王林口的父老们乘我们休息的时候，给我们发纸烟、发枣子和花生慰劳我们，并且还写了极其热情的送行信。
    （二）强渡桑乾河
    出征部队，进抵察南雁北后，摆在面前的是桑乾河。这是一条中等的河流，河床宽的地方才一里半，夏天水深数尺，可以徒涉；冬天结了厚厚的冰层，大车可以畅行。但是春天特别是清明前后，冰消水冷，上游如桌子大小的冰块，随波逐流，翻滚冲击，架桥极为困难，何况河底又是流沙！我们曾用了很大的力量在敌机扫射轰炸下架设了铁炼桥和木马桥，工兵们和穿着牛皮裤子的水手们，曾经在冰河里艰苦工作，为我们出征大军架好了一些桥梁，但是，因为部队多，战斗任务又急，许多部队都是徒涉这条冰河的。
    跟随炮兵的记者庆祥同志说：渡河时，一下水大家不约而同的倒吸了一口气，迈不几步，大家感到下肢不属于自己了。骡子仗着人护架，人又仗着马力，防止不被水冲倒。但刚渡一半，有的驮炮骡子被水冲倒了，有的骡子被乱石绊倒。某连连长一见，顾不得脱棉衣就跳到冰河里，指挥大家抢救骡子，他说：“立功就在这时候哇！”于是，许多人跳到水里去，有的同志为了寻找弹药，在刺骨的冰河之中，不顾被冰割破而流着血的伤口来回渡过几次。二排长李玉琪一上岸，就要大家检查器材，但他的嘴一句话也说不出来，战士们帮助他穿好衣裳，扶他到村里取暖，他身体本来很弱，但由于革命的责任心，使他不能不在冰水中坚持工作，以完成战斗任务。战士们形容当时冰河的情形：“牙格格的直响，混身发抖，腿冻的不知有多粗，脚不知有多大，踏在地上好象在空中一样，软绵绵的，不知踏在什么地方。”驮炮的马，一出水也是抖作一团，身上流下的水，在肚皮上结成半尺长的冰柱，而平时摇摆的尾巴，都结成了一根长长的冰柱，动都不能动。
    这种艰苦，并不能挡住具有高度阶级觉悟的人民勇士，任何的困难也是挡不住他们的。
