Study and Discussion

　　This newspaper has specially set up this column as a place for everyone to raise questions, discuss problems, and answer questions in their studies. Here, we will first publish several questions we have received, hoping that everyone will answer them. It is fine to answer individually, or to write out the answers after collective discussion. After the answers are published, we hope to launch a broad discussion.

　　Why study the history of social development first?

　　In the recent decision of the North China Bureau on the study of on-the-job cadres, the first book on the reading list is "A Brief History of Social Development." Now the revolutionary situation is developing rapidly, and there are many policies and theories that we urgently need to study. Why should we first study the distant past history in this tense and busy situation? What direct help does studying it give us in grasping policies and improving our work at present? (Li Yu)

　　What are the weaknesses of small producers?

　　In the second paragraph of the "Preface to the Reprint of 'Left-Wing Infantilism'" by the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, it says that in places where the forces of imperialism, Chinese feudal forces, and bureaucratic capital have been overthrown, they "attempt to use the weakness of the dispersal and isolation of the rural areas and small producers to restore autocratic feudalism." Where exactly are the weaknesses of rural areas and small producers specifically manifested? How do imperialism, feudal forces, and bureaucratic capital utilize them? (Sun Shijie, Lingshi Sub-branch of the North China Bank)

　　What is rural bureaucraticism?

　　In studying "Lenin on How Soviet Officials Should Work," I don't understand what is meant by "rural bureaucraticism." What are its manifestations? Why is it called "rural"? How harmful is it? (Ma Qiyuan, Headquarters of the North China Military Region)

　　What is the empiricist learning method?

　　The "Decision of the North China Bureau on the Education of On-the-Job Cadres" says: "The empiricist learning method is very popular within the Party in North China." It concludes by saying that there are handicraft-style and guerrilla-style learning methods. What exactly are empiricist, handicraft-style, and guerrilla-style learning methods? Where are they specifically manifested in our past studies? What harm do they do to us? How can we overcome them in the future? Are the learning methods of "group discussion," "connecting with reality," and "reflecting on oneself" all wrong? Can they still be used in the future? (Tie Fu, etc., Enterprise Department of the North China Government)

　　How to read the newspaper?

　　The People's Daily is the newspaper representing the North China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and there are often many good things on it that we need to learn. However, some comrades here feel that "the newspaper is available every day, and there is limited free time outside of work. If there is no good method of reading the newspaper, it is impossible to know where to start with the various materials in the newspaper, reading and flipping through them haphazardly, wanting to read this and wanting to read that, unable to grasp the focus, and not getting the benefits that should be obtained." What methods, approaches, and attitudes should be adopted for reading the newspaper? How to combine it with practical work?
　　(Li Yuzhuo, Taihang First Special Commissioner's Office)

### 学习讨论

专栏：学习讨论

　　学习讨论
    本报特设这一栏，作为大家在学习中提出问题、讨论问题、解答问题的地方。这里先把我们已收到的几个问题发表出来，希望大家来答。个人答也好，经过集体讨论后写出答案也好。答案登出来后，并希望展开广泛的讨论。
    为什么要先学习社会发展史？
    最近华北局关于在职干部学习的决定中，学习书目的第一本便是“社会发展简史”。现在革命形势正迅速发展，有许多政策、理论，都迫切需要我们学习。为什么在这种紧张忙迫的形势下要先学习遥远的过去的历史呢？学了它对我们目前掌握政策、改进工作有些什么直接帮助呢？（李玉）
    小生产者的弱点是什么？
    中共中央宣传部“重印左派幼稚病第二章前言”第二段里说：帝国主义势力、中国封建势力、官僚资本在他们的势力已被推倒的地方，“企图利用农村与小生产者的分散与孤立这一个弱点，而重新恢复专制封建主义”。究竟农村与小生产者的弱点具体表现在什么地方？帝国主义、封建势力、官僚资本如何利用它们呢？（华北银行灵石支行孙世杰）
    什么是农村式官僚主义？
    我在学习“列宁论苏维埃机关人员如何工作”中，对其中所说到的“农村式的官僚主义”不懂。它都是些什么表现？为什么叫“农村式”的？它的危害性有多大？（华北军区司令部马启元）
    什么是经验主义学习方法？
    “华北局关于在职干部教育的决定”中说：“经验主义的学习方法，在华北党内很流行。”最后还说有手工业式的和游击式的学习方法。到底什么是经验主义的、手工业式的和游击式的学习方法？它们在我们过去的学习中，具体表现在什么地方？对我们有什么害处？今后怎样去克服它们？“小组讨论”、“联系实际”、“反省自己”这些学习方式是不是都是错误的？以后还能用不能？（华北政府企业部铁夫等）
    怎样读报？
    人民日报是代表中共中央华北局的报纸，上面经常有好多好东西需要我们学习。但我们这里有些同志感到“报纸每天有，工作之余闲暇时间有限，如果没有很好的读报方法，对报上各种各样的材料便无从下手，乱读乱翻，这也想看、那也想看，抓不住重心，得不到应有的好处”。读报究竟应采怎样的方法、方式、态度？怎样与实际工作结合？
    （太行一专署李玉琢）
