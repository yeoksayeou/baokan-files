Xinhua News Agency, Pingjin Front, 26th – Frontline reporters report on the grand occasion of the Northeast Army entering the pass: Less than twenty days after completely annihilating the Kuomintang bandit troops in the Northeast, the Northeast Liberation Army received the order to enter the pass ahead of schedule. All commanders and fighters gladly accepted the glorious task of liberating all of North China and completely annihilating the Kuomintang bandit troops in North China. They quickly prepared their military attire and embarked on a thousand six hundred li journey, marching under the stars and moon. The endless stream of artillery, vehicles, people, and horses advanced bravely through the rolling yellow dust, entering the pass from Shanhaiguan, Lengkou, and Xifengkou through the Great Wall in one, two, and three routes. As the vanguard of this long line won its first victory on the Pinggu line, its rear was still in Shenyang.

The morale of the troops is unprecedentedly high. Soldiers from the Northeast expressed one after another: "The elder brothers inside the pass helped us liberate the Northeast, so we should enter the pass to help them liberate North China." They overcame narrow-minded localism and resolutely left their hometowns temporarily. Tang Hetian, the deputy political instructor of an artillery battalion, only left a few simple words for someone to deliver to his family when he passed by his home village in Jinzhou: "When you see my family, just tell them that I am still in the Liberation Army. This time, I have gone to the pass. We can return victoriously after we eliminate the Kuomintang reactionaries." Soldiers from North China were even more beaming with joy, celebrating that they could personally participate in the cause of liberating their hometown. Encouragement workers marched along the way, playing and singing, complementing the majestic pace of the great army, forming a real and historically significant triumphal march. Those comrades who remained in Northeast hospitals for recuperation but were unable to enter the pass anxiously hoped to be discharged quickly so as not to miss this great opportunity.

The people outside and inside the pass offered both cordial farewells and warm welcomes. Everywhere the army went, red and green flags fluttered in villages and towns, and arches made of pine and cypress trees stood tall. Groups of villagers smiled excitedly when they saw the strings of cars and American-style artillery. The slogan "March to Nanjing and capture Chiang Kai-shek alive," which is about to become a reality, and the slogan "Welcome the Northeast Liberation Army to enter the pass" were seen everywhere. Yangge dance teams filled the air with the sounds of gongs and drums, creating a scene more festive than the New Year. The people in the old liberated areas of eastern Hebei treated the Liberation Army like family members, asking them about their well-being, boiling water, and cooking food as soon as they saw them. In the evening, every household lit lanterns and torches to greet them. Some landlords secretly got up at night to heat the kangs (heated platforms) in their homes, for fear of waking up the Liberation Army who were tired from their journey. Villages collected grain and prepared firewood. Some areas had already rushed to repair roads overnight, building roads one zhang (3.3 meters) wide with a flat surface and two zhang (6.6 meters) width. Every few feet, they also dug air raid shelters. They said, "Quickly build bridges and repair roads so that our troops can get their artillery and vehicles through and quickly take Pingjin."

Jizhong Branch Frontline Electric: People along the Beining Railway Line Thank the Northeast Liberation Army. Having been liberated from the bloody hands of the Jiang-Fu bandits, they are excitedly and enthusiastically supporting the Northeast Liberation Army's attack on Pingjin. Under the call of the Military Control Commission, Langfang merchants organized a support-the-front committee. They registered and distributed supplies day and night, saying happily: "If we don't do it now, when will we?" The Baozhang (village head) of Daguanzhuang also quickly handed over the three guns of the puppet self-defense corps and led the troops to seize twelve guns from the police station. On the 18th, the troops were stationed in Daguanzhuang (more than thirty households). Men and women, old and young, in the village worked together all night to grind flour, saying, "This is the army that liberated us, quickly grind flour for them." The next day, they delivered it all before the sun rose. After our staff explained the situation and the new area policies to everyone and said that they would organize a support-the-front committee, Qi Zhenfang, who was in his sixties, said loudly: "Count me in. This is our world now, let's do it!" On the 18th, the Langfang town held a meeting of office workers from various villages to arrange support-the-front work. The meeting closed when the sun was about to set, and by nine o'clock, more than one hundred carts had arrived, delivering eighty thousand jin of grain to the troops. The notice temporarily borrowing rice and flour said that it should be delivered by the morning of the 19th. After receiving the notice, the villages ground flour all night. Wanzhuang, with twenty-nine households, ground five hundred jin of flour overnight, saying, "Quick, let's be busy for a few days and we'll enjoy happiness for ten thousand generations." Many people in the suburbs of Anci City, upon hearing that the troops were coming soon, busily cleared rooms and heated kangs. The enthusiasm of the people in the new area to support the Liberation Army and their eagerness to take Pingjin early is burning like a raging fire.

　　东北入关大军战志高昂
  　沿途群众高扎彩楼欢迎
    千六百里长途锣鼓喧天盛似新年
    【新华社平津前线二十六日电】前线记者报导东北大军入关的盛况称：在全歼东北国民党匪军之后不到二十天，东北解放大军就奉到提前入关的命令。全体指战员欣然接受了解放全华北、全歼华北国民党匪军的光荣任务，迅速整好了戎装，披星戴月，踏上一千六百里的长途。绵延不断的炮、车、人、马，在黄尘滚滚中英勇前进，一路、两路、三路，从山海关、从冷口、从喜峰口穿过万里长城入关。这一支漫长的行列，当它的先头部队已在平古线上旗开得胜的时候，它的后尾还在沈阳。
    部队士气空前高昂。东北籍的战士纷纷表示：“关里的老大哥帮助俺们解放了东北，俺们就应该进关帮助他们解放华北。”他们克服了狭隘的乡土观念，坚决地暂时离别自己的家乡。某部炮兵营副政治指导员唐贺田，路过锦州某村自己的家门时，只托人留下简单的几句话：“见到我家里人，只说我还在解放军，这次进关去了，消灭了国民党反动派就可以胜利回来。”华北籍的战士，更是喜气洋洋，欢庆自己能亲身参加解放家乡的事业。行军鼓励工作者，沿途演奏着、歌唱着，配合伟大行伍雄壮的步伐，形成一部真实的有历史意义的胜利进行曲。那些留在东北医院疗养未能入关的同志则焦急地希望自己赶快出院，以免错过了这个大好的时机。
    关外和关内的人民，一边是亲切的欢送，一边是热烈的欢迎。大军到处，乡村城镇红绿小旗飞扬，松柏彩牌高竖。成群的老乡，看到连串的汽车和美式的大炮兴奋地微笑。“打到南京去活捉蒋介石”这一即将成为事实的口号，和“欢迎东北解放军入关”的标语，沿途到处可见。秧歌队锣鼓喧天，盛似新年情景。冀东各地的老解放区人民，对解放军新如家人，一见便问寒问暖，烧水做饭。晚上，家家户户也起来提灯打火，尽力招呼。有些房东晚上偷偷地起来烧炕，生怕惊醒了旅途劳顿的解放军。村村集中了粮食，准备了柴草。有些地区则早已连夜赶修好一掌平二丈宽的马路，每隔几尺，还挖好防空掩体。他们说：“赶快架桥修路，让咱们部队好过炮车，快些去打下平津。”
    【冀中分社前线电】北宁沿线人民感谢东北解放军。从蒋傅匪血腥手中解放出来，正以无比的兴奋，热烈支援东北解放军攻打平津，在军管会号召下，廊坊商人组织了支前委员会。昼夜不停的登记和分发供应物资，都高兴地说：“这时再不干，还等啥时候呀！”大关庄保长也赶快把伪自卫团的三支枪交出来，还领着部队起出警务段十二支枪。十八日，部队驻在大关庄（三十多户）该村男女老少齐动手连夜磨面，都说：“这是解放咱们的部队，赶快给他们磨面。”第二天，还没出太阳就都送齐。我工作人员向大家讲解形势和新区政策后，并说组织支前委员会。这话刚说完，六十来岁的齐振芳大声说：“我算上一份，这就是咱们的天下啦，干吧！”十八号廊坊镇召开各村办公人会议，布置支前工作。太阳快没的时候闭了会，到九点钟就来了一百多辆大车，给部队送去八万斤粮食。十八日暂借米面的通知，说十九号上午交齐，各村接到通知后，连夜不停的磨面。十九日太阳出来，就都送来了。二十九户的万庄一宿磨出五百斤面，都说：“快了，快忙伙几天就享上万辈子福了。”安次城郊许多老百姓听说部队快过来了，忙着腾房、烧炕。新区人民爱护解放军盼望早日打下平津的热情，象烈火一样燃烧着。
