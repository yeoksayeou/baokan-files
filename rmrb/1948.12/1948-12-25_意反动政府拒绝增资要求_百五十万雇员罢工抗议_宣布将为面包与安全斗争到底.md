Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, December 23rd: Reports from various sources: One and a half million employees of various Italian government departments held a 24-hour general strike on the 20th to demand wage increases. The Liaison Committee, jointly formed by the Italian Government Employees Union and the Secretariat of the Italian General Confederation of Labor, issued a notice on the 19th, announcing that government employees have been forced to resume their struggle for bread and family security. The notice stated: The government should be fully responsible for the adoption of this decision. The government had proposed establishing a mixed committee with the parliament to resolve the differences as quickly and fairly as possible, but the government later rejected the decision made by this committee. Government employees are fully aware that they are fighting not only to defend their own vital demands, but also to defend the interests of the entire country. The notice pointed out that government employees are willing to limit the strike to 24 hours for the needs of the country, and hope that the parliament can approve the fair recommendations of the mixed committee. Government employees firmly believe in the justice of their cause and are confident that they will receive the sympathy and support of the entire country as in the past. According to TASS, after more than two months of discussions, the "Mixed Committee" formed by the Italian Parliament and the government to resolve the issue of wage increases for government employees made a decision, advocating that government employees' salaries should be increased by category. The Italian General Confederation of Labor and the Government Employees Union issued a statement supporting the committee's recommendations, but this recommendation was rejected by the Council of Ministers on December 15.

　　意反动政府拒绝增资要求
    百五十万雇员罢工抗议
    宣布将为面包与安全斗争到底
    【新华社陕北二十三日电】各方报导：意大利政府各种工作的雇员一百五十万人，为要求增加工资于二十日举行二十四小时总罢工。意政府雇员联盟与意大利总工会书记处合组的联络委员会，曾于十九日发出通告，宣布政府雇员已被迫恢复他们为面包和家庭安全的斗争。通告称：这一决定的采取，应完全由政府负责。政府曾建议与议会设立混合委员会，以求最快最公平地解决分歧，但是，政府后来又拒绝了这一委员会所作的决定。政府雇员们完全清楚他们不仅是为保卫自己的切身要求而斗争，同时也是为保卫整个国家的利益而斗争。通告指出：政府雇员们为了国家的需要，愿意把罢工限制为二十四小时，希望国会能够批准混合委员会的公正建议。政府雇员们深信他们的事业的正义性，确信他们将象以往一样获得全国的同情和支持。按：据塔斯社称，在历时两月以上的讨论之后，意大利议会与政府为解决政府雇员增加工资问题而组成的“混合委员会”曾作出决定，主张政府雇员的薪资应分类增加。意大利总工会及政府雇员联盟曾发表声明，支持该委员会的建议，但这一建议于十二月十五日为部长会议所否决。
