Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 5th: Electone News Agency, Prague: The Czechoslovakian Minister of Agriculture, Dulus, recently delivered speeches at the Farmers' Association and the Socialist Academy, stating that 95 percent of Czechoslovakia's industry has been nationalized, while 95 percent of agriculture is still individually operated. Almost half of the individual farms have less than two hectares of land, and more than 84 percent of individual farms have less than ten hectares of land. Mr. Du stressed that this dispersion of farmland ownership makes it extremely difficult to implement agricultural plans and fertilization plans. He pointed out that despite the hard work of farmers, the net value of agricultural production per person per year is only 20,000 Czech crowns, while the net value of industrial production per worker per year is 70,000 Czech crowns. The reason for this disparity is the old-fashioned production methods, which not only hinder the improvement of farmers' living standards but also generally hinder grain production. Therefore, in order to achieve the goal of increasing production by 37 percent, the agricultural five-year plan will focus on accelerating agricultural mechanization, establishing tractor stations and livestock breeding stations, and developing various cooperatives, especially production cooperatives, as much as possible, to lay a solid material and technical foundation for improving agricultural productivity. He explained that small and medium farmers will understand from their experience that cooperatives—which must be strictly guarded against the influence of rich peasants—serve their interests by acting as sellers of agricultural products and purchasers of town products. In 1930, Czechoslovakia had only 3,000 tractors, and 96 percent of the land was in the hands of landlords owning more than 20 hectares of land. Today, Czechoslovakia has 22,000 tractors, of which 65.4 percent belong to state-owned and cooperative tractor stations. By the end of the five-year plan in 1953, there will be 45,000 tractors, and each village will have at least three tractors and other agricultural machinery, with each tractor working on 125 hectares of cultivated land.

　　捷克农业部长号召：
    全力加速农业机械化  尽量发展各种合作社
    【新华社陕北五日电】电通社布拉格讯：捷农业部长杜律斯最近在农民协会及社会主义学院相继发表演说称：捷克斯洛伐克的工业有百分之九十五已经国有化，而农业则百分之九十五还是个体经营。几乎有一半的个体农场，土地不足两公顷，有百分之八十四以上的个体农场，土地在十公顷以下。杜氏力称：这种农地所有权的分散，使实行农业计划与施肥计划极为困难。他指出：尽管农民辛勤劳动，但每人每年农业生产的净值仅为两万捷币，而工人每人每年工业生产的净值则为七万捷币。这种悬殊的原因，是由于旧式的生产方法，这种方法不但阻碍农民生活水平的提高，还一般地阻碍粮食的生产。因此，农业五年计划为了要达到增加生产百分之三十七的目标，将集中全力加速农业机械化，普遍设立拖拉机站和牲畜饲养站，并尽量发展各种合作社、特别是生产合作社，为提高农业生产率打下稳固的物质与技术基础。他解释称：小农和中农会从他们的经验中了解：合作社——这要严防受到富农的影响——是充当农产物的出售者及城镇产品的采购者而为他们的利益服务的。一九三○年，捷克斯洛伐克仅有三千辆拖拉机，有百分之九十六的土地操在拥有土地二十公顷以上的地主手中。而今，捷克斯洛伐克已有二万二千辆拖拉机，其中百分之六十五点四属于国营与合作社的拖拉机站所有。到一九五三年五年计划结束时，将有四万五千辆拖拉机，每个村庄将至少拥有三辆拖拉机及其他各种农业机械，每一辆拖拉机将在一百二十五公顷的耕地上工作。
