Troops with High Political, Military, and Cultural Cultivation
    He Wei
    The People's Liberation Army is not only a culturally cultivated force, but also has new developments in war literature. Its main feature is the emergence of thousands upon thousands of "gun barrel poems" from the People's Liberation Army on the Taiyuan front. The authors are almost entirely soldiers, filled with vivid, clear, highly ideological, and simple poems. The basic theme expressed is hatred and contempt for the enemy and the firm will to victory of the entire army. Wang Zhangcheng, a first-class meritorious soldier of the Li Hai-shui Company, in his poem "Victory Conditions Are Endless," not only wrote about the rich mass and material foundation of the People's Liberation War, but most importantly, he maintained a clear mind, constantly examined the operational environment and conditions, and had the perseverance to overcome difficulties. His original work is as follows: "We are confident in taking Taiyuan, the victory conditions are endless. First, weapons and ammunition are sufficient, and food and fodder are piled up like mountains. Trains and cars whistle, transporting supplies to the front from all directions. Second, the masses come to support the front, carrying and transporting voluntarily. Everyone comes to fight Yan's bandits, and the Yan bandits are scared out of their wits. Third, the troops are strong and the horses are sturdy, and we have experience in siege warfare. The casualties in taking Beiying were small, and individual soldiers have the courage to carry out demolition. Fourth, the higher-level command is good, and Commander Xu is highly resourceful. The 'digging heart' tactic is really powerful, dividing and encircling for a big feast. Fifth, we occupy Mount Dadong, and the favorable terrain belongs to us. We can launch attacks from a high position, and shells fall into the city. The victory conditions are all in place, but possible difficulties must also be considered: the weather is cold and the cave dwellings are damp, and it may sometimes be difficult to eat. There are too many people and the villages are too small to accommodate everyone, and drinking water and soup are inconvenient. Sometimes there are not enough civilian laborers, and ammunition cannot be delivered in time. Some difficulties are unexpected, and may cause you temporary trouble. There will definitely be difficulties in fighting, but overcoming difficulties comes first. Think of more solutions and there will be solutions. Implement the plan to earn merit, persist for the last five minutes, and enter Taiyuan with might and majesty." Soldiers of the 456th unit collectively created a poem called "Fighting a Blocking Battle," which says, "Don't shoot from afar, don't panic up close, when the enemy approaches, use grenades to inflict casualties," which is a masterpiece that fully expresses tactical thinking. They also draw inspiration from exemplary battles and heroes, and even write about their beloved weapons, because they have personally experienced combat life, and their writing is very vivid and lively. Zhang Weijing used Zhang Shulin's demolition as the subject matter, from Zhang Shulin's proactive work in peacetime, to his brave undertaking of demolition during combat, to his instruction of the troops to charge after the demolition, resulting in the capture of thirty-eight Yan bandits. Assault team member Sun Jinshan praised the grenade in this way: "Grenade, fourteen ounces, when thrown, it explodes loudly, blasting the enemy into calling for their parents—shouting: 'Don't attack anymore, we'll surrender immediately!'" Bugler Zhang Jinzhong wrote about his bugle call in this way: "My bugle is really good, as soon as it sounds the whole company moves, the sound of 'di di da da' calls, and all comrades rush forward, making the enemy look like mice unable to find a hole, scurrying around and becoming prisoners." Many "gun barrel poems" have a great effect on educating the troops. Yan's bandits were inhumane and used poison gas in battle, so the soldiers wrote "Anti-Poison" poems: "When a poison bomb explodes, the sound is not loud, the smoke does not rise, it crawls along the ground. Run to high ground, the poison will dissipate. There are also ways to deal with it in the trenches. Put a bundle of firewood, and light it when you encounter poison. When the fire burns, the air goes outside, and the poisonous gas will dissipate with the wind! People surround the fire, and it will be fine. To defend the position, the target is too big. Use a bullet to knock down the medicine, and it will be very effective when heated. Yan's bandits' conspiracy will be burned." Poems such as "Attacking Cement Bunkers," "Dealing with Incendiary Bombs," and "Using Enemy Flares" all show that our soldiers are also soldiers with scientific minds and military knowledge, otherwise they would not be able to write so profoundly. In battle, in the dead of night, the soldiers recited their own "gun barrel poems" to the enemy. One poem specifically describes the scene of the Kuomintang bandits' 30th Division's counterattack being惨败, which is a very good political poem: "The 30th Division came to counterattack, and ate enough grenades and shells—died in Taiyuan and can't go home, will their parents and children cry?" The company's "door board newspaper" posts countless "gun barrel poems" created by soldiers every day, and the "People's Soldiers' News" has a "Selection of Gun Barrel Poems." The 22nd Unit's "trench leaflet" uses a large number of "gun barrel poems." Some soldiers put the poems on the gun stocks, artillery trays, artillery bodies, and ammunition boxes, and some simply wrote them on their lunch bags and rice bags. They can be "published" everywhere, and they are circulating everywhere. "Gun barrel poems" have become a unique form that soldiers like to hear and see, and is created for soldiers.

　　具有高度政治军事文化教养的部队
    何微
    人民解放军不仅是有文化教养的部队，而且对战地文学也有新的发展。它的主要特点，是太原前线人民解放军，有成千成万篇“枪杆诗”的产生，作者几乎完全是战士，充满了生动明确、具有高度思想而又朴素的诗篇，其表现的基本主题——是对敌人的仇恨蔑视和全军的坚强的胜利意志，李海水连一等功臣王章成的“胜利条件说不完”，不只写出了人民解放战争有丰厚的群众和物质基础，最高贵的是他保持了清醒的思考，时刻审察作战的环境和条件，并有战胜困难的毅力。他的原作如下：“咱有把握打太原，胜利条件说不完，第一武器弹药足，粮草马料积如山，火车汽车唔唔叫，四方八面运前线。第二群众来支前，抬运彩号自觉干，人人都来打阎匪，阎贼吓也吓破胆。第三兵强马又壮，攻坚作战有经验，打下北营伤亡小，单兵爆破有孤胆。第四上级指挥好，徐司令员智谋高，挖心战术真厉害，分割包围大会餐。第五占了大东山，有利地形归于咱，踞高临下打冲锋，炮弹落到城里边。胜利条件齐具备，可能困难也要看：天寒地冷窑洞湿，也许有时难吃饭，人多村小住不下，吃水喝汤不方便，民工有时不够用，弹药一时赶不上。有些困难想不到，临时给你添麻烦。打仗一定有困难，克服困难最当先，多想办法有办法，立功计划要实现，坚持最后五分钟，威风凛凛进太原。”四五六部队战士有一篇“打阻击仗”的集体创作，其中说：“远不打枪，近不发慌，敌人接近，手榴弹杀伤”，是充分表现战术思想的杰作。他们更从模范战斗和向英雄取材，甚至写自己心爱的一件武器，因为他们切身体验了战斗生活，写出来十分生动活泼。张维景就是以张树林爆破为题材，从张树林平时工作积极，战斗时勇敢担任爆破，一直到爆破后，指示部队冲锋时机，获得俘虏三十八个阎匪的胜利。突击队员孙金山这样歌颂手榴弹：“手榴弹，十四两，投出去，炸得响，炸得敌人叫爹娘——大叫：‘你们别再打，我们马上就投降’！”司号员张尽忠这样写他的冲锋号：“我的号，真是行，只要一响全连动，滴滴哒哒连声叫，全队同志往前冲，冲得敌人好象老鼠找不着洞，乱窜乱碰当了俘虏兵”。有许多“枪杆诗”对教育部队来说作用很大。阎匪惨无人道，在战斗中施放毒气，战士们便写了“防毒”诗：“毒弹爆炸，响声不大，烟不上升，顺地来爬。往高处跑，毒顺气没啥。交通壕内，也有办法，放一捆柴，遇毒点它，大火烧着，空气外爬，毒气顺风，也就散啦！人围火旁，也就没啥。坚持阵地，目标嫌大，一颗子弹，把药倒下，遇毒一烘，效力也大。阎匪阴谋，火烧完啦”。又如“打洋灰碉”、“对付燃烧弹”、“利用敌人照明弹”等都说明我们的战士又是有科学头脑和军事常识的战士，不然写不成这样深刻的。在战斗中，在深夜里，战士们用自己创作的“枪杆诗”，对敌人朗诵。一首专描写蒋匪三十师反扑惨败的情景，是很好的政治诗：“三十师，来反扑，手榴弹炮弹吃了个足——死在太原回不了家，爹娘老少哭不哭？”连队的“门板报”，每天有无数战士创作的“枪杆诗”贴出，“人民子弟兵报”有“枪杆诗选录”。二二部队的“战壕传单”，大量采用“枪杆诗”，有的战士便把诗贴到枪托上，炮盘上，炮身上，弹药箱上，有的干脆写在饭包上，米袋上，到处都可以“出版”，无处不在流传。“枪杆诗”便成了战士喜闻乐见，为战士创作的独特形式。
