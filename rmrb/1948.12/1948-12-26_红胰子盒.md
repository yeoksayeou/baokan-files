　　The troops entered Longsheng Village along the winding mountain road. The familiar wide street was there, and past the intersection, the small door on the west side of the south road was the old landlord of the Fourth Squad of the communications company. The soldiers of the Fourth Squad thought, "Why are we staying at this house again? It's so awkward..."
　　A knock on the door brought the landlord, who opened it, responding repeatedly, "Coming, coming!" The soldiers said as before, "Landlord, we're troubling you again!" "No trouble at all, come in and warm up." As soon as they entered the house, the landlord's wife brought in a cotton quilt and two leather cushions to spread on the kang. The landlord's eldest son brought water, carried over a basket of yams, and busied himself splitting firewood in the yard. The wife rushed to boil water and cook the yams. The soldiers wanted to help, but the wife said, "You've been traveling all night, take a rest." The soldiers thought, "That's strange! How has the landlord changed this time?"
　　Early the next morning, the wife came in with a red soap box. Everyone recognized this soap box. They wondered, "How did Wang Guiliang's soap box get into the landlord's hands?" Before the soldiers could ask, the wife said, "You can't find a better army than yours anywhere! Fu Zuoyi's troops take whatever they want, and if you're slow to lend them something, they'll beat and curse you. What they borrow is never seen again. You lost a broom and even compensated with a soap box, and left a letter." As she spoke, she opened the soap box and took out a piece of paper. The comrades recognized it as Wang Guiliang's handwriting:
　　"Elderly Landlord Woman: I lost your broom. I'm sorry! Our People's Liberation Army doesn't take a single needle or thread from the people; we compensate for any damage. I don't have any money, so I'm leaving you the soap box as compensation. Please accept it. Wang Guiliang."
　　After everyone read it, they understood what had happened. No wonder the landlord was treating them so well this time.
　　A few days ago, at night, it was raining continuously. When the soldiers arrived at Longsheng Village, their backpacks, cotton coats, and pants were all soaked. The Fourth Squad stood in the rain waiting for housing assignments, hoping to stay with a good landlord, buy some firewood to dry their quilts and clothes, and sleep warmly for a night.
　　As soon as the Fourth Squad entered the landlord's door, they clearly saw a large pile of firewood in the shed, but when they asked to buy some, the landlord said they didn't have any. They had to buy some firewood from another family to dry their clothes and get through the night.
　　In the afternoon, as they were about to depart, the landlord couldn't find the broom. The soldier Wang Guiliang searched everywhere but couldn't find it. The troops were about to assemble outside the door, and Wang Guiliang anxiously paced around the room, thinking about compensating. He felt his pockets but had no money. He thought about leaving, but then realized that wasn't right. "Compensate for damages" was the rule, and it couldn't be broken, especially in the new district. He grabbed the red soap box. "I'll leave the soap box as compensation!" He immediately felt a little more at ease, scribbled a note, put it inside, and left.
　　The troops set off again. The Fourth Squad swept the landlord's yard, filled the water tank, and apologized to the landlord, "We've troubled you again, elder, we'll come back and see you again."
　　"No trouble at all, we're all one family, don't mention it." As they spoke, the whole family saw them off, a dozen eyes watching the backs of the Fourth Squad comrades, constantly urging, "Come back and stay at our house again, come by and rest if you're nearby." The troops walked far away, and the landlord's family was still at the door, watching the retreating figures of the troops.

　　红胰子盒
    杨觉
    部队沿着山上蜿蜒小路进了隆盛庄，熟悉的大街宽宽的，过十字街往南路西一家小门就是通信连四班的老房东，四班战士们心说：“怎么又住到这家了？怪蹩扭……”
    一叫门，房东连声答应着开了门，战士们照旧说道：“房东，又麻烦你们来了！”“不麻烦，快进屋暖和暖和。”刚进屋，房东大娘就抱进一床棉被、两个皮褥子，给铺在炕上。房东大儿子提过水，端过一筐山药蛋，又在院里忙劈着柴，大娘抢着烧水煮山药蛋，战士们要烧，大娘说：“你们走了一宿啦，歇歇吧。”战士们心说：“真怪！这回房东怎么变啦？”
    第二天一早，大娘拿着个红胰子盒进来，大伙认识这胰子盒。心里猜疑：怎么王贵良的胰子盒到了房东手里？没等战士们问，大娘就说：“普天下找不着你们这么好军队！傅作义的军队见甚么要什么，借东西拿慢点就打就骂，借去就没影。你们丢了个扫炕笤帚还赔个胰子盒，留封信。”说着打开胰子盒抽出一个纸条。同志们一看认识是王贵良的笔体：
    “房东老大娘：把你的扫炕笤帚丢了。对不起！咱们解放军不拿老百姓一针一线，损物赔偿。我没钱，把胰子盒赔了你，请收下吧。王贵良。”
    大伙看完了，心里才明白是这么回事，怪不得房东这回待咱这么强。
    这是前几天的夜里，雨不停的下着，战士们走到隆盛庄时背包、棉袄、裤子都湿透了。四班挺立在雨中等待着号房，心里都希望住个好房东，买点柴火烤烤被子衣裳，暖暖的睡一夜。
    四班一进房东门，明明看见草棚里大堆柴火，一说买点，房东说没有。只好在别家买了点柴火烤干衣服，对付着过了一夜。
    下午要出发，房东扫炕笤帚找不着了，战士王贵良四下乱找也没找着。部队在门外要集合了，王贵良急的在屋里转圈想赔，一摸兜里没钱；想走，一想不对，“损物赔偿”这是纪律，在新区更不能犯。一把摸着红胰子盒，“把胰子盒赔了他吧！”心里马上塌实了点，顺手写了个字条放在里边走了。
    部队又出发了，四班给房东扫了院子，挑满了水缸，又向房东道歉：“又麻烦你们了，老人，我们再来再看你们。”
    “不麻烦，咱们一家人不说这个。”说着，一家子送出来，十几只眼睛望着四班同志，不住嘱咐：“再来还住咱家里，离近了想着来家里歇歇。”部队走远了，房东一家子还在门口望着部队的后影。
