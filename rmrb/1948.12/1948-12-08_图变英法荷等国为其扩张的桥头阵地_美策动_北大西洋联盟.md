Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 27th. A comprehensive report: In order to expand its control over Western Europe, and in view of the unsatisfactory progress of the Western European Union it created, American imperialism has recently been plotting the so-called "North Atlantic Alliance." According to news from Washington in late October, the proposed "North Atlantic Alliance" plan, under the guise of "defending against aggression," is pursuing its conspiracy to prepare for a new war of aggression. It is planned that the United States, Canada, Britain, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg will first conclude a so-called "North Atlantic Mutual Defense Treaty," and then rope in other Western European countries to join. Member countries must standardize their military equipment and take joint action when any one of them is subjected to "aggression." Obviously, in such an "alliance," due to the United States' personal participation as the leader, the member countries will be further subjected to American command.

However, just as with the notorious Western European Union, the planned North Atlantic Alliance countries, between the United States and its British and French partners, still have different dreams and their own plans. The U.S. State Department hopes to sign an Atlantic Pact similar to the Pan-American Pact, while the reactionary governments of Western European countries, on the one hand, hope to obtain more economic and military assistance from such an alliance from the United States to counter the increasingly high tide of democratic forces at home; on the other hand, they are also seriously arguing because the greed of American imperialism is too harmful to themselves. Therefore, since Marshall, Bevin, and Schuman met in Paris on October 5 to expand the five-nation military alliance into the "North Atlantic Alliance," progress has been slow. During this period, the United States has been conducting frequent activities in Western Europe without much success. The warmonger Dulles flew to Stockholm at the end of October to woo Sweden without achieving the expected results. Even the fascist Portuguese government expressed doubts about this alliance. U.S. Secretary of Defense Forrestal flew to Europe on November 9, trying to promote the "North Atlantic Alliance," but until recently, U.S. Acting Secretary of State Lovett stated when receiving reporters on November 17 that there was no new development in the North Atlantic Pact.

The editorial in the Prague newspaper "Lidové Noviny" on the 14th compared this Atlantic war group to Hitler's "Atlantic Wall," explaining that Hitler's Atlantic Wall was built on extremely fragile foundations. The newspaper pointed out: "This conspiracy is certainly not a new trick, but the Atlantic Alliance is an attempt by imperialism to form a group that is purely anti-Soviet, anti-people's democratic countries, and anti-all progressive humanity." The newspaper concluded: "The center of the combination of interests between the United States and the reactionary governments of Western Europe is the United States' economic and war potential. However, the Marshall Plan has brought devastating disasters to the economies of these countries, causing constant tension, which is the biggest weakness of the Atlantic Alliance plan."

### 图变英法荷等国为其扩张的桥头阵地　美策动“北大西洋联盟”

　　图变英法荷等国为其扩张的桥头阵地
  　美策动“北大西洋联盟”
    【新华社陕北二十七日电】综合报导：美帝国主义为了扩大其对西欧的控制，并鉴于它一手造成的西欧联盟进行得很不顺利，近又策动所谓“北大西洋联盟”。据十月底华盛顿方面传出的消息，拟议中的“北大西洋联盟”计划，将假“防御侵略”之名，遂行其准备新侵略战争的阴谋，先由美、加、英、法、荷、比、卢七国缔结所谓“北大西洋联防公约”，然后再网罗西欧其他国家参加。入盟各国须统一军备，并在任何一国遭受“侵略”时，采取共同行动。显然，在这样一个“联盟”中，由于美国之亲自以盟主资格参加，入盟各国势将更进一步臣服于美国指挥之下。
    但是，正如臭名昭著的西欧联盟情形一样，计划中的北大西洋联盟各国之间，美国与它的英法等伙伴之间，依然是同床异梦，各有各的打算。美国务院希望订一个类似泛美公约的大西洋公约，而西欧各国反动政府一方面希望从这样一种同盟当中得到美国更多的经济与军事的援助，以对抗国内日益高涨的民主力量；另一方面，却又因美帝国主义的贪欲对他们本身的损害太大，发生了讨价还价的严重争执。因此，自十月五日马歇尔与贝文、舒曼在巴黎会谈扩大五国军事同盟为“北大西洋联盟”以来，进展迟缓。这期间，美国在西欧各地进行频繁的活动尚未见有多大收获。战争贩子杜勒斯十月底飞斯托哥尔姆拉拢瑞典没有得到预期的结果。甚至连法西斯的葡萄牙政府也对这一联盟表示怀疑。美国国防部长福莱斯特尔在十一月九日飞赴欧洲，力图促成“北大西洋联盟”，但直到最近，美国代理国务卿罗维特在十一月十七日招待记者时声称北大西洋公约一事尚无新发展。
    布拉格“里都维·诺温尼”报十四日的社论，把这个大西洋战争集团与希特勒的“大西洋壁垒”相比拟，说明希特勒大西洋壁垒是建筑在极其脆弱的基础上的。该报指出：“现在这一阴谋诚然不是什么太新的花样，但大西洋联盟乃是帝国主义想组成一个清一色反苏、反人民民主国家和反一切进步人类的集团的企图。”该报结语称：“美国与西欧反动政府之间彼此利益结合的中心是美国的经济和战争潜力，可是，马歇尔计划给这些国家经济带来毁灭性的灾难，引起了不断的紧张，这正是大西洋联盟计划最大的弱点。”
