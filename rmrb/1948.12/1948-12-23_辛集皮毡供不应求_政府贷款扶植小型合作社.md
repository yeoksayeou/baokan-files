[Jizhong Dispatch] Xinji's white leather and felt industry has greatly developed. Sales of white leather have now exceeded last year's by six and a half times, while felt shoes have exceeded three times. More than ten white leather businesses in the city went to Shandong this spring to purchase more than 14,000 raw hides, and in the summer and autumn, they organized merchants to purchase a batch of raw materials from Shanxi. More than twenty felt businesses also raised funds in April and May to buy more than 4,000 catties of coarse wool from Southern Hebei and Western Hebei. In July and August, they borrowed some money from the bank to prepare raw materials and produce finished products to meet winter sales. In order to open up sales channels, the city's factories contacted foreign merchants through Taichang Leather Shop to organize exports. During the summer and autumn, a total of more than 7,000 hides were sold to Tianjin, Zaoqiang, Daying and other places. After autumn, peddlers from Southern Hebei, Western Hebei, and Central Hebei counties, as well as shops in various counties, cities, and towns, were contacted to organize promotion. With this vigorous promotion, production could not keep up with sales. Since November, most factories and workshops have sold whatever they produced each day. As of the end of November, the leather industry had sold 34,000 pieces of white sheepskin and 200 to 300 pieces of dog skin, exceeding last year's by six and a half times. More than 180,000 pairs of felt shoes were sold, exceeding last year's by more than three times. In the face of short supply, more than 20 leather businesses purchased a large number of semi-finished white sheepskins from Southern Hebei, and purchased more than 7,000 raw hides from the vicinity of the city, launching a "full vat" (a vat that is done when goods are sold out and sales are high, not one that is done every year). Workers have very high production enthusiasm during the full vat process. For example, Zhang Fulin, Zhang Genrui, and a dozen others pooled funds to form a small cooperative workshop while contracting work in other factories, and produced on their own in their spare time. A dozen leather sewing workers over sixty years old, who had not sewn for more than ten years, began sewing leather for factories and workshops again because production expanded this year and there was a shortage of workers. Even so, production was still not enough to meet sales, and factories and workshops added night shifts to rush production day and night. Due to the benefits of sales, profits were very high. The profit amount calculated by the factories and workshops generally exceeded three to four times their capital. For example, Hengyichuan's capital was 20,000 yuan in new currency when purchasing goods in the spring, and now the profit is 90,000 yuan. Tongdehe's capital was equivalent to more than 950 hides, and the current total value is more than 1,500 hides. Due to the great profits in the leather and felt industry, the number of operators is increasing. Last year there were seventeen white leather businesses, and this year it has grown to twenty-seven. The felt industry has increased from twelve to thirty-seven. Last year there were a total of 120 white leather workers, and now there are 170. The number of felt workshop apprentices has also increased by about 100 this year.
The city's white leather and felt industry has been able to develop so much not only because the liberated areas are expanding and sales channels are open, the purchasing power of farmers has increased after the land reform, and the correct implementation of our party's policy of developing industry, but also because of: (1) Strong support from the bank. The 37 felt businesses have borrowed a total of about 800,000 yuan in new currency in two loans; the white leather businesses have borrowed more than 350,000 yuan. Small handicraft operators such as Zhang Fulin have also received a loan of 10,000 yuan to support their small joint venture. (2) More than 80% of the industry is jointly operated, and most of the members work in workshops, belonging to small-scale cooperation. They are active in production, plan carefully, and have precise accounting in their operations. (3) A reasonable wage and bonus system has been implemented. More than 80% of the workers are implementing a wage and bonus system, while general short-term workers are paid by the piece, which greatly stimulates the workers' production enthusiasm. The current problems are that there is a shortage of houses and workers. The factories are planning to train a large number of apprentice workers next year and are preparing to launch investment to expand production.

　　辛集皮毡供不应求
    政府贷款扶植小型合作社
    【冀中电】辛集的白皮、毛毡业有很大发展。现白皮的销售已超过去年六倍半，毡鞋则超过三倍。该市十余家白皮业在今春即到山东收买生皮一万四千余张，夏秋间又组织商贩到山西采购了一批原料。二十余家毡业也在四、五月间集资到冀南、冀西买来粗毛四千余斤，七、八月间又从银行贷款一部，准备原料、制出成品，以应冬季销售。为打开销路，该市各厂通过泰昌皮店联络外来商人组织了出口。在夏秋间计销于天津、枣强、大营等地七千余张。入秋以后，联络冀南、冀西、冀中各县小贩及各县、市、镇之商店组织推销。在此大力推销下，产量供不上销售。十一月份以来大部工厂作坊每天产多少销多少。截止十一月底，皮业已销出白羊皮三万四千张，狗皮二、三百张，超过去年六倍半。毡鞋销出十八万余双，超过去年三倍余。在供不应求的情况下，二十余家皮业又从冀南购来大批白羊皮半成品，及从该市附近收买生皮七千余张，开展了“全缸”（是在备货售完，销路很大的情况下才进行的缸，不是每年都做。）全缸中工人生产情绪很高。如张福林、张根瑞等十来人，一面在其他工厂包工，一面集资组成小型合作作坊，抽空自己生产。十几个六十余岁的缝皮工人，已十几年不缝了，但因为今年生产扩大，工人缺乏，又重新给工厂作坊缝起皮来。就这样，生产品还是不够销售，各工厂作坊又增加夜工日夜赶制。由于销售上的得利，赢利很厚。一般工厂、作坊按款计算赢利额都超过资本三倍至四倍上下。如恒义川春季购货时资金合新币二万元，现得利九万元。同得合按货计本合皮九百五十余张，现总值一千五百余张。由于皮毡业得利很大，经营者日益增多，去年白皮业十七户，今年已发展到二十七户。毡业则由十二户增到三十七户。白皮工人去年共一百二十人，现增加一百七十人。毡房学徒今年也增加一百人上下。
    该市白皮、毛毡业能如此发展，除了解放区日益扩大销路畅通，土地改革后农民购买力提高及正确贯彻我党发展工业的政策等主要原因外，还由于：（一）银行的大力扶植。三十七户毡业，两次计贷款合新币八十万元左右；白皮业计借贷三十五万余元。小手工业者张福林等组织的小型的合资经营，也得到一万元的贷款扶植。（二）该业十分之八以上是合资经营，社员多在作坊作工，属于小型合作性质。在经营中生产积极，计划周密，并有精密的核算。（三）实行了合理的工资与分红制度。十分之八以上的工人是实行工资分红制，对一般短工则实行按件计资，如此大大刺激了工人的生产积极性。目前的问题是房子、工人均感缺乏，工厂方面正计划明年大量培养学徒工人，并准备发动投资，扩大生产。
