　　Xinhua News Agency, Jicha Rehe Liao, 30th -- The strategically important Shanhaiguan on the Guannei (inner) section of the Beining Railway and the ice-free good harbor of Qinhuangdao were liberated on the 27th. The defending enemy's New Fifth Army and remnants of the Hebei Security Tenth Regiment gathered in Qinhuangdao and escaped by boat. Currently, there are no enemy traces east of the Luan River from Shanhaiguan on the Guannei section of the Beining Railway. Shanhaiguan, also known as Yuguan, is the starting point of the Great Wall, bordering the Bohai Sea to the south and leaning against Jiaoshan Mountain to the north. It is the throat connecting traffic inside and outside the pass, and the Beining Railway runs through it. The urban population is approximately 60,000. Qinhuangdao is southwest of Shanhaiguan and is the ice-free good harbor on the northeast end of the Hebei Province coast. Every winter, when Dagukou freezes, merchant ships traveling to and from Tianjin dock here, and goods are transported to Tianjin from here; coal from the Kailuan Coal Mine is also mostly exported from here. The city has a population of approximately 100,000, and the city includes enterprises such as Kailuan Mining Bureau, Yaohua Glass Factory, and Jibei Electric Power Company, and a railway factory.
