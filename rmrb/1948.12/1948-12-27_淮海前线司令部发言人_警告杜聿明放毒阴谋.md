  　Warns of Du Yuming's Poison Gas Plot
    【Xinhua News Agency, Huaihai Front, 24th】 The spokesperson of the Huaihai Front Command issued a statement regarding Du Yuming's troops' plot to use poison gas during their breakout: According to Gu Bohang, captured Deputy Head of the Xuzhou "剿匪总司令部" (剿匪总司令部 was the HQ of the KMT suppression of bandits, but is better translated as "Bandit Suppression Headquarters") Guard Regiment under Du Yuming's command, Du Yuming's Qiu Qingquan and Li Mi corps are currently preparing to break out, and plan to use aircraft cover and release large amounts of poison gas during the breakout. Chiang Kai-shek's bandits have already airdropped 180,000 gas masks to this unit since the 18th. I, on behalf of the Huaihai Front People's Liberation Army Command, solemnly warn Du Yuming, Qiu Qingquan, and Li Mi. You are now at the end of your rope. Whether you hold your ground, break out, bomb, or use poison gas, you will not escape the fate of being annihilated like the Huang Baitao, Huang Wei, and Sun Yuanliang corps. If you want to save yourselves and the lives of your subordinates and families, the only option is to immediately surrender with your troops and not destroy your weapons. If you do so, this army can still leniently consider your punishment, no matter how heinous your past crimes. However, if you dare to use poison gas, we will certainly execute the order of the General Headquarters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army on November 1st to punish war criminals, and severely punish you three as war criminals, without any forgiveness. This army's words are law. We hope you will pay close attention to our warning, immediately cease your poison gas plot, and surrender to this army.

　　淮海前线司令部发言人
  　警告杜聿明放毒阴谋
    【新华社淮海前线二十四日电】淮海前线司令部发言人为杜聿明部阴谋于突围时放毒事发表谈话说：据杜聿明部俘虏徐州“剿总”警卫团副团长顾伯衡供称：杜聿明所率邱清泉、李强两兵团，现正准备突围，突围时阴谋以飞机掩护外，并将大量施放毒气。蒋匪自十八日起已空投该部防毒面具十八万件。本人特代表淮海前线人民解放军司令部严重警告杜聿明、邱清泉、李强三人。你们现在已经山穷水尽。无论你们死守也好，突围也好，轰炸也好，放毒也好，你们决逃不出象黄伯韬、黄维、孙元良三兵团一样地被歼灭的命运。你们如果要保全自己与你们的部下和家属的生命，就只有立即率众缴械投降，并不得破坏武器。如果你们这样做，则无论你们过去如何罪恶滔天，本军仍可对你们从宽议处。但如你们敢于施放毒气，则我们必定执行中国人民解放军总司令部十一月一日惩办战争罪犯的命令，把你们三人当作战争罪犯严厉惩办，决不饶恕。本军言出法随，望你们切实注意我们的警告，立即停止放毒阴谋，并向本军缴械投降。
