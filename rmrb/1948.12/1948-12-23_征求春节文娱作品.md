Soliciting Spring Festival Literary and Artistic Works

To literary and artistic workers, correspondents, and all readers across the country:

The New Year is approaching, and celebrations of victory are taking place everywhere, inspiring all soldiers and civilians to strive for even greater victories. We urge correspondents, literary and artistic workers, and all readers across the country to quickly write street plays, street poems, clapperdash, living newspapers, folk songs, Spring Festival couplets, and collective games, etc. There are no restrictions on form, but strive for liveliness and vividly express the joyful and encouraged emotions of the masses in the rear, where land reform has been completed, and at the front, where victories are being achieved one after another. We are prepared to dedicate sufficient space to publish as much as possible, and hope everyone gets started quickly!
