Regarding the Waste of Civilian Labor Caused by Two Hundred Empty Carts Returning from Huolu
　　The North China Government's Ministry of Finance Publicly Conducts Self-Criticism

Regarding the criticism in the People's Daily on October 13th that "mobilizing two hundred carts to transport grain to Yangquan, resulting in empty return trips and waste of civilian labor due to poor planning," the following explanation and self-criticism are provided:

On September 1st, the Jinzhong Logistics Headquarters sent a telegram stating: "Frontline troops and civilian laborers are short of grain." Over two million catties of grain transferred to Yangquan from the rear could not be transported due to Jinzhong's lack of transportation capacity. The telegram requested that the rear find a way to dispatch two hundred rubber-wheeled carts to Yangquan for transshipment. The telegram only reached the Ministry of Finance on the 14th after passing through several locations. At that time, there were no rubber-wheeled carts available. The Ministry of Finance considered that the rear was in the midst of the autumn harvest, mobilization would be difficult, and there was a risk of not meeting the deadline. However, because the commander of the Jinzhong Logistics Headquarters was also present, stating that Jinzhong was indeed unable to transport the grain and that the rear must find a way, the decision was made after repeated consideration to mobilize two hundred civilian carts. On the 15th, the issue was discussed with the Logistics Office of the Military Region, requesting them to mobilize the carts from the Fourth Sub-district of Beiyue to arrive in Yangquan by the 20th. The office initially replied that they were not certain and needed to consult with the Logistics Headquarters of the Fourth Sub-district. On the 16th, they replied that mobilization was possible. On the 17th, the Ministry of Finance telegraphed Jinzhong and requested that Jinzhong also mobilize some human and animal power to jointly complete this task. Unexpectedly, during this period, Jinzhong had already organized the transportation of grain to Yangquan by donkey and manpower from the front, but did not inform the rear. The carts from the Fourth Sub-district arrived in Yangquan on the 23rd, but the grain stored in Yangquan had been transported away the day before, and the one million catties continuously transferred to Yangquan from Hengshui had not yet arrived, resulting in an empty trip. At that time, the Yangquan supply station had other materials waiting to be transported to the front, but because the person in charge of the grain station was absent, the station was not contacted, resulting in the empty return of the carts.

The main reason for the waste was the supply of grain and grass during wartime. At the North China level, there was no specific organization in charge of the work. In the past, for each campaign, the Ministry of Finance only arranged the amount of grain and grass, and the administrative office was responsible for the specific transfer and transportation. This time, the transfer of grain to the front from Yangquan was difficult to mobilize because the area under the city's jurisdiction was small and it could not complete the task independently. The leadership failed to solve this problem in a timely manner, resulting in poor communication between all parties, which caused a waste of civilian labor and also affected the full guarantee of supplies to the front. We have indeed committed bureaucratic errors in our organization and leadership. Now the Logistics Headquarters of the Military Region is preparing to add a supply department, with personnel from the government participating to strengthen the supply work during wartime. Here, we would like to express our apologies to the civilian laborers from the Fourth Sub-district who enthusiastically supported the front but returned with empty carts.

### 关于获鹿二百辆大车空车往返浪费民力事　华北政府财政部公开检讨

　　关于获鹿二百辆大车空车往返浪费民力事
  　华北政府财政部公开检讨
    人民日报十月十三日，批评“动员二百辆大车到阳泉运粮，因计划不周，空车往返，浪费民力”一节，今检讨说明如下：
    九月一日晋中后勤司令部来电：“前方部队民工缺粮”后方调到阳泉的二百余万斤粮食因晋中无运输力运不上去，要求后方无论如何设法派二百辆胶轮大车赶到阳泉转运。电报因经过几个地方，十四日才转到财政部，当时并无胶轮大车，财政部曾考虑后方正在秋收，动员亦有困难，且恐时间赶不上，后因晋中后勤司令员亦在此，说晋中确无力运，必须后方设法。反复考虑，才决定动员二百辆民车。十五日电大军区后勤办公室商量，要他在北岳四分区动员，二十日赶到阳泉。办公室当时答复亦无把握，须与四分区后勤司令部商量再定，十六日回话说可动员。财政部十七日电复晋中并要晋中再动员一部人、畜力共同完成此任务；而不料在此期间，晋中已在前方组织驴驮人背到阳泉突击，而未电告后方。四分区大车二十三日赶到阳泉，阳泉存粮已于前一日运完，而衡水续调阳泉的一百万余斤又未赶到，两头落了个空。当时阳泉兵站尚有其他物资待运前方，又因粮站负责人不在，未找兵站联系，因而大车空回。
    检讨造成浪费的原因，主要是对战时粮草供应。华北级无管具体工作的机构，过去每个战役，财政部只布置粮草数字，具体调运则由行署负责，此次阳泉调前方粮，因该市管辖地区很小，动员困难，不能独立完成任务；领导上没有及时解决这个问题，使的各方面联系很差，因而造成了浪费民力现象，在充分保证前线供给上亦有影响。我们在组织领导上的确是犯了官僚主义的。现在大军区后勤司令部已准备添设供应部，由政府派人参加，加强战时的供应工作。在这里并向四分区热烈支前空车返回的民工致歉。
    （华北政府财政部）
