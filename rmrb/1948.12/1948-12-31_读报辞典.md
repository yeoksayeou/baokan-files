　　Malaya—South from Yunnan Province in China, past the border between Vietnam and Burma, and further south past Siam (Thailand), you reach the Malay Peninsula; Malaya is the southernmost part of the Malay Peninsula. This region has an area of ​​more than 136,900 square kilometers and a population of 5.8 million, of which the number of overseas Chinese is the largest, reaching 2.8 million, followed by 1.5 million Malays, 600,000 Indians, and 900,000 Siamese, Filipinos, British, and other Europeans and Americans. Malaya is in the tropics and grows rubber trees, and its rubber production is the highest in the world. British imperialism invaded Malaya more than 160 years ago. Before World War II, Malaya was divided into three parts: 1. The Straits Settlements, composed of Penang, Malacca, and Singapore; 2. The Federated Malay States, composed of Perak, Pahang, Selangor, and Negeri Sembilan; 3. The Unfederated Malay States, composed of Johor, Kedah, Kelantan, Terengganu, and Perlis. The Straits Settlements were directly ruled by British imperialism; the Federated Malay States were nominally ruled by the Federated Malay States government; and the Unfederated Malay States were nominally ruled by the heads of the states, but in reality, they were subject to the arbitrary exploitation of British imperialism, just like the Straits Settlements. In 1942, the Japanese invaders invaded from the south, and the British army in Malaya fled without a fight. The people of Malaya, under the leadership of the Malayan Communist Party, organized guerrillas and bravely resisted the Japanese invasion for three years, making great contributions to the entire War of Resistance Against Japan. After the Japanese surrendered in 1945, British imperialism immediately returned to Malaya, forced the Malayan People's Anti-Japanese Army to hand over their weapons, and promulgated reactionary decrees that restricted democratic freedom, forcibly purchased rubber at low prices, and controlled foreign trade, attempting to restore its past enslavement and oppression. After three years of anti-Japanese struggle, the national consciousness of the Malayan people, especially the working class, had been unprecedentedly enhanced, and they naturally could not tolerate such cruel oppression by British imperialism. They showed heroic and unyielding resistance struggles everywhere. At the end of 1945, the strike movement had spread to the central and northern parts of Malaya. In January 1946, in Singapore, 190,000 workers went on strike and 95% of the shops closed down to protest the arrest of Wang Jingguang, the leader of the Malayan anti-Japanese movement. Two months later, a large-scale strike of 500,000 people broke out to protest the arrest of another anti-Japanese military leader, Song Guang, by British imperialism. Fearing the strength of the Malayan people's resistance, British imperialism announced the so-called "Malayan Federation" plan at the end of 1946, stipulating that Malaya should be divided into two administrative regions, Singapore and the Malay Peninsula. Singapore was directly ruled by a governor appointed by British imperialism; the Malay Peninsula was to organize a so-called independent Malayan Federation, but in reality, all independent power was still controlled by the British High Commissioner stationed in the Malayan Federation, and the colonial status of Malaya was not changed in the slightest. Therefore, the people of all classes led by the Malayan Communist Party immediately launched a new anti-British movement and drafted a "Malayan People's Constitution." In such continuous struggles, the strength of the Malayan people is rapidly developing and rising, which has laid the foundation for the victory of the Malayan people's liberation struggle.
　　Greek Democratic Government—Greece is a country in the southern part of the Balkan Peninsula in Europe. It is bordered by the sea on the east, west, and south, and by Bulgaria and Albania on the north. It has an area of ​​130,000 square kilometers and a population of 6.2 million. During World War II, it was occupied by fascist Germany. At that time, the Greek reactionary government fled to Britain, but the Greek people, under the leadership of the Communist Party, persisted in the struggle against fascism. After the end of World War II, the fleeing reactionary government returned to Greece with the support of American and British imperialism, and re-established a regime that enslaved the Greek people. The Greek people, unwilling to be enslaved, gradually formed a powerful democratic army under the leadership of the Greek Communist Party, and carried out a heroic armed struggle against the reactionary government army directly aided and directed by American and British imperialism. On December 23 last year (1947), when the Greek People's Democratic Army had controlled four-fifths of the country, it began to establish the Greek Provisional Democratic Government. General Markos, the commander-in-chief of the Democratic Army, served as the premier and minister of the army of the Provisional Democratic Government. From then on, the Greek people's liberation struggle became closer to the final victory in the whole country.
　　Yoshida Shigeru—is a famous Japanese "moderate" militarist. The Mitsui Zaibatsu is his boss and backer. He is also the president of the reactionary Liberal Party of Japan. After the Shidehara Cabinet was driven off the stage by the Japanese people on May 16, 1946, American imperialism ordered the Japanese Emperor to pull Yoshida up to be the prime minister to replace Shidehara in suppressing the Japanese people, but his life was not long, and he was driven off the stage by the Japanese people after a year. In October of this year, when the Ashida Cabinet collapsed shamefully due to a major corruption case, American imperialism, in order to continue attacking the Japanese democratic movement, re-elected the reactionary Yoshida. He once said that his cabinet's task was to "suppress the strike movement" and ensure broad possibilities for the activities of American imperial capital in Japan.
　　Security Council—is a standing body representing the United Nations to handle international political, military, and diplomatic disputes during the adjournment of the United Nations General Assembly. It is equivalent to the Standing Committee of the United Nations. It is composed of representatives from eleven countries, of which the five countries of the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and China are permanent members, and there are six non-permanent members with a term of two years, and half of them are re-elected at the United Nations General Assembly every year. When deciding on a case, seven votes are required for passage, but all five permanent members must vote in favor. Under the Security Council, there is also a Military Staff Committee, composed of the chiefs of staff of the five permanent member states. The Security Council has the responsibility to maintain peace and security, but as a result of the reactionary group headed by the United States implementing an aggressive policy, its effectiveness has been greatly reduced.

    马来亚——从中国的云南省向南，经过越南、缅甸交界的边境，再南经过暹国（泰国）就到达马来半岛；马来亚，就是马来半岛最南的一部分地区。这地区共有十三万六千九百余方公里的面积，有五百八十万人口，其中我国华侨人数最多，达二百八十万，其次是马来人一百五十万，印度人六十万，暹国、菲列滨、英国及其他欧洲、美洲人共九十万。马来亚属于热带，生长橡树，橡胶的产量，为世界第一。英国帝国主义在一百六十多年前侵占马来亚。在第二次世界大战以前，马来亚是分成三个部分的：一、海峡殖民地，是由槟椰屿、麻六甲、新加坡三州所组成；二、马来联邦，是由霹震州、彭亨州、雪兰峨、森美兰四个邦所组成；三、马来属邦，是由柔佛、吉冷、丹丁、加奴、加央吉他五个帮所组成。海峡殖民地属英帝国主义直接统治；马来联邦名义上是由马来联邦政府统治；马来属邦名义上是由属邦首长统治，但实际上都与海峡殖民地一样，受到英帝国主义的任意宰割。一九四二年，日寇南侵，马来亚的英军不战而逃，马来亚人民在马来亚共产党领导下即组织了游击队，英勇地抵抗日寇侵略达三年之久，对整个抗日战争有着很大的供献。一九四五年日寇投降以后，英国帝国主义立刻又回到了马来亚，强迫马来亚人民抗日军缴出武器，并且颁布了限制民主自由、低价强购树胶、统治对外贸易等反动法令，妄图恢复已往的奴役压榨。经过了三年抗日斗争，民族意识空前提高的马来亚人民，尤其是工人阶级，对英帝国主义这样残酷的压迫，当然不能忍受，到处表现了英勇不屈的反抗斗争，一九四五年底，罢工运动，曾普遍至马来亚的中部和北部。一九四六年一月，因为反对英帝逮捕马来亚抗日领袖王锦光，在新加坡发生了十九万工人罢工，和百分之九十五的商店罢市的抗暴运动；两个月以后，又为了抗议英帝国主义逮捕另一民抗军领袖——宋光，而爆发了五十万人的大罢工。英帝国主义慑于马来亚人民反抗的力量，于一九四六年底公布了所谓“马来亚联邦”计划，规定把马来亚划分为新加坡马来半岛两个行政区，新加坡由英帝国主义委派总督直接统治；马亚半岛，组织所谓独立的马来亚联邦，但实际上一切独立的权力，仍操纵在英帝国主义派驻在马来亚联邦之高级专员手里，马来亚的殖民地地位，毫未改变。因此，马来亚共产党领导的各阶层人民，就立即展开了新的反英运动，并曾草拟了“马来亚人民宪法”。在这样不断的斗争里，马来亚人民的力量，正在迅速的发展与高涨，这就奠定了马来亚人民解放斗争的胜利基础。
    希腊民主政府——希腊是欧洲巴尔干半岛南部的一个国家。东西南三面滨海，北方与保南及阿尔巴尼亚接界。面积十三万方公里，人口六百二十万。第二次世界大战时曾被法西斯德国所占领，当时希腊反动政府逃亡到英国，希腊人民却在共产党领导下，坚持了反对法西斯的斗争。第二次世界大战结束，逃亡的反动政府在美英帝国主义的支持下又回到了希腊，重新建立起奴役希腊人民的政权，不甘遭受奴役的希腊人民，在希腊共产党的领导下，逐渐的组成了强大的民主军队，与美英帝国主义直接援助与直接指挥下的反动政府军队，进行着英勇的武装斗争。到去年（一九四七年）十二月二十三日，希腊人民民主军队已经控制了希腊全国五分之四的地区的时候，就开始成立了希腊临时民主政府。民主军的总司令马科斯将军，担任了临时民主政府的总理兼陆军部长。从此，希腊人民的解放斗争，就更加接近于全国范围的最后胜利。
    吉田茂——是日本有名的“稳健派”军国主义分子，三井财阀是他的老板后台，也是日本反动党自由党的总裁，一九四六年五月十六日币原内阁被日本人民撵下台后，美帝国主义叫日皇把吉田拉上来做首相，代替弊原镇压日本人民，但他的寿命也不长，一年功夫又被日本人民赶下台，在今年十月，当芦田内阁因大贪污案而可耻地垮台后，美帝国主义为继续进攻日本民主运动，重新捧出反动的吉田登台，他曾说他的内阁任务是“镇压罢工运动”及保证美帝国资本在日本活动的广阔可能性。
    安理会——是联合国大会闭会期间代表联合国处理有关国际间政治、军事、外交上的纷争的常备机关，相当于联合国的常委会。它由十一国代表组成，其中苏、美、英、法、中五国是常任理事国，另有六国非常任理事国，任期为二年，每一年于联合国大会时改选一半。议决案件时，须有七票始能通过，惟必须五常任理事都投同意票。在安理会之下尚有军事参谋委员会，由五常任理事国参谋总长组成。安理会本具有维持和平及安全的责任，但是由于以美国为首的反动集团执行侵略政策的结果，他的效能是被大大的减低了。
