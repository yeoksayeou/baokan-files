　　How Does Wucheng Organize Disabled Veterans to Participate in Production and Work?
　　Xiao Jia
　　There are 711 disabled veterans in the ten districts of Wucheng County. In the past, work related to veterans was weak, and there were some disunity issues between veterans and local cadres and the masses. Some veterans were also capable of working but did not engage in production. Since the establishment of the County Veterans Affairs Bureau in July, leadership has been strengthened to enable veterans in rural areas to participate in production and work, improve the social status of veterans, improve the economic lives of veterans, and strengthen the unity between veterans and the local community.
　　I. Holding Unity Meetings to Break Down Barriers Between Veterans, Cadres, and the Masses
　　From July to November, two or three unity meetings were held for village cadres and veterans, focusing on the fourth and fifth districts (because these two districts have a larger number of veterans). Before the meetings, materials related to the relationship between veterans and the local community were collected from various sources. Village cadres and veterans first held separate meetings to unify their thinking and clarify their understanding. Then, they held joint meetings to solve problems and conduct criticism and self-criticism. The main problems on the veterans' side were: some comrades had a "meritorious service" mentality, only wanting to enjoy benefits and not participate in labor and production; some believed that they should be given special treatment because of their contributions; and some even lost their stand and sided with landlords and rich peasants, standing in opposition to the peasants. For example, Zhao Guoxian, a veteran from another village in Tushan, lived with a landlord and ate with him. Thirteen veterans from other villages in Mazhuang cultivated 25 mu of land and used 700 substitute laborers from March to July. Some who were capable of production did not want to engage in production. Village cadres reviewed their shortcomings, mainly selfishness and self-interest, excluding veterans from other villages, and insufficient care for veterans. For example, the chairman of the representative of Yian Village reviewed that he was unwilling to distribute land and the fruits of victory to veterans. He said, "If they (referring to veterans) share the fruits of victory in our village, will our village have less?" The secretary of the Dama Village Commune was jealous of the veterans' active and upright behavior in the land reform, feeling that it hindered their selfishness and the distribution of more fruits of victory. After both sides raised their opinions at the meeting, they both admitted their mistakes through mutual criticism and self-criticism. Some who initially tried to cover up and deny their mistakes were exposed and criticized by others. This created conditions for establishing correct thinking and smoothly resolving problems.
　　II. Organizing Labor Exchange and Mutual Assistance to Participate in Agricultural and Sideline Production
　　After the meetings, the veterans understood that participating in production was glorious and displayed the glorious tradition of the people's soldiers. The majority actively participated in production, and many core members emerged. Nine veterans from other villages in Tushan Village in the fifth district and five veterans from other villages in Nanying Village in the fourth district successively established production teams and led veterans in Yian, Shunzong, Mazhuang, Muliancheng, and other villages. They adopted the method of collective living, joint meals, and mutual assistance in production to organize themselves to participate in production. The grain harvested from each person's land still belonged to them. Gao Shubin, a second-class disabled veteran from another village and the leader of the Tushan production team, carried a manure basket with him whenever he went out and could collect three baskets of manure every day. He said, "With manure, we can have enough to eat." Under his influence, Zhao Guoxian, a loafer veteran, also dug pig pens to accumulate fertilizer, and Peng Jinrong, a veteran from Shunzong, also carried a manure basket and started production. After being organized, not only was production done well, but also substitute labor from the village was completely unnecessary, reducing the burden on the masses. Eight veterans from other villages in Yian cultivated 25 mu of land and harvested a total of 25 shi of grain, 2,000 jin of yams, and more than 200 Chinese cabbages. Besides enough to eat for a year, there was also a surplus. Veterans from various places in their native villages also actively participated in production. Deng Yulin, a veteran from Nanying Village, organized eight veterans in his village to form a production team, elected Deng Yulin as the team leader, and also had a secretary to record work points. In the spring, they planted 102 mu of abandoned military land and harvested 20 shi of grain after deducting costs and paying public grain. In the autumn, they planted 45 mu of wheat. Deng Yulin also exchanged labor with Liu Zenglu, an anti-Japanese relative in his village who had no labor. This spring, Deng Yulin asked his younger brother to automatically cultivate two mu of land for Liu Zenglu. When Liu Zenglu's family found out, they wove two bolts of cloth and made a pair of large shoes to send to Deng Yulin. Because Deng Yulin's family had no one who did needlework, he sent some cotton to Liu Zenglu's family after receiving these things. This year, they exchanged labor in this way, and both families' land was cultivated very well, and the difficulties of both sides were solved.
　　The veteran production teams in each village also carried out various sideline productions according to their own conditions. Under the leadership of team leader Sun Baoyi, five veterans from other villages in Yian production team opened grocery stores, sold tofu, and pulled carts. With three dou of soybeans as capital, they made four tofu every day and sold them to earn one dou of soybeans, using the bean dregs to feed two pigs, two livestock, and a cart to pull. Those who could not participate in other labor watched the stalls and sold goods. Li Xianwen's three-person veteran shop in Tushan earned 60,000 yuan (new currency) from March to July with a capital of 2,000 jin of rice. Others include Hu Qingxiang and other veterans in Nanying opening shops, veterans' production teams in Tushan Village boiling saltpeter, and Mi Hengcun, a veteran from Xibai Village in the second district, spinning thread, etc. They did whatever they could in production, and everyone participated in division of labor and mutual assistance in production.
　　The veterans in each district concentrated 200,000 yuan of their preferential treatment grain and opened a honor store in the county. The state-owned store also provided assistance and support to let them sell goods on consignment. The veteran production teams in each village sold goods here cheaper than others, facilitating veterans in various places to do small business production. Each veteran has received a lot of dividends in sideline production, which subsidized their lives and made them very wealthy.
　　III. Actively Participating in and Assisting in Various Village Works
　　In addition to working hard in production, the veterans in each village also actively participate in various works. In Tushan, Yian, Nanying, and Mazhuang villages, as many as 25 veterans serve as village chiefs, company commanders, instructors, branch committee members, deputy chairmen of the representative conference, and other cadres. Many of them served in village works before joining the army, also served as cadres in the army, and are now leading cadres in local works. For example, Gao Shubin, a second-class disabled veteran from another village in Tushan, served as the director of the armed forces committee in the village in the past, served as an instructor in the army, and is now the instructor of the company headquarters in the village. In the collection of public grain, they are all actively striving to pay first. Geng Tuyue, a loafer veteran in Tushan Village in the past, did not produce or pay public grain. This year, under the promotion and influence of others, he also actively participated in production. He pushed the waterwheel without livestock; he did not pay public grain for the past two years, and this year he also took the lead in paying.
　　IV. Carrying Out Criticism and Self-Criticism to Transform and Educate Individual Backward Elements Among Veterans
　　In production and various works, individual backward and non-producing veterans are regularly given criticism and education through the leadership of active elements. The veterans have all been educated in the army and have been tested by bloody battles, so the vast majority are good and are able to obey leadership, accept criticism, and correct mistakes. For example, Zhao Guoxian, a veteran from another village in Tushan, and Hu Qingxiang, a veteran from another village in Nanying, lived and ate with landlords and protected landlords, etc.; after criticism and education, they moved out of the landlords' homes and severed relations with the landlords.
　　In general, Wucheng's work has achieved considerable results. Veterans have also gained preliminary experience in participating in production and participating in the construction of the liberated areas. However, the work of veterans in the county as a whole still needs to be continued and developed in the future, and attention should be paid to strengthening their study and leadership in organizing veterans' production, so that they can be further improved ideologically, politically, and culturally. In addition, in the production of veteran teams, the method of collective production, labor exchange, mutual assistance, and harvesting for individual ownership is very good, but some cannot appropriately exchange labor according to the strength of labor and production conditions. In future production, attention should be paid to achieving equivalent exchange in order to make veteran production mutual assistance more solid.

　　藁城是如何组织荣军参加生产与工作的？
    肖甲
    藁城县十个区共有荣誉军人七百一十一名，过去荣军工作薄弱，荣军与地方干部、群众的关系上，存在着某些不团结现象，还有某些荣军能劳动而不事生产，自七月成立县荣军局以后，加强领导，使在乡荣军参加生产，参加工作，提高了荣军社会地位，改善了荣军经济生活，也加强了荣军与地方的团结。
    一、召开团结会议打破荣军与干部群众的隔阂
    从七月至十一月以四、五区为重点（因为该两区荣军较多），召开过两、三次村干部与荣军的团结会议。会前从各方面搜集了有关荣军与地方关系的材料，村干荣军先分别开会搞通思想，明确认识以后，再合开解决问题，进行批评自我批评。荣军方面主要的问题是：有些同志有功臣思想，只愿享受，不参加劳动生产；有些认为自己有功就应该特殊；甚至还有个别失掉立场与地主富农站在一起与农民对立。如土山外籍荣军赵国贤与地主住在一起合伙吃饭。马庄十三个外籍荣军种廿五亩地，从三月到七月用了七百个代耕工，有些能生产的也不想生产。村干部检讨自己缺点主要是自私自利，排斥外籍荣军，对荣军照顾不够等问题。如宜安村代表主席检讨，不愿意分给荣军土地与胜利果实。他说：“他们（指荣军）在咱村分胜利果实，咱村不少了吗？”大马村公所书记对荣军在土改中的积极正派嫉视，觉得妨碍了他们的自私和多分果实。双方意见在大会上提出后，经过互相批评与自我批评都承认了自己的错误，有个别在开始时还企图掩护抵赖的，都被别人揭发和批评，这样使正确思想得以树立，使问题得到顺利解决的条件。
    二、组织拨工互助、参加农副业生产
    会后，荣军中明确了参加生产是光荣的，发挥了人民战士的光荣传统，大部积极起来参加生产，并出现不少骨干分子。五区土山村九个外籍荣军，四区南营村五个外籍荣军，先后成立了生产小组，并带动宜安、顺中、马庄、木连城等村荣军，他们采取集体居住、碰伙吃饭、互助生产的办法，组织起来参加生产。各人地内打的粮食仍然归自己。土山生产组长外籍二等荣军高书斌，什么时候出门都背着粪筐，每天能拾三筐粪。他说：“有粪就能吃饱饭”。在他影响下，二流子荣军赵国贤也挖猪圈积肥，顺中荣军彭金荣也背上粪筐生产起来了。组织起来后不但生产搞的很好，而且完全不用村中代耕，减轻了群众负担。宜安八个外籍荣军，种地廿五亩，共收粮食二十五石，山药两千斤，还有二百多棵白菜，除够一年吃的外还有富余。本籍各地的荣军也都积极的参加了生产，南营村荣军邓玉林，组织了本村八个荣军，成立了一个生产小组，选举邓玉林担任组长，还有一个书记记工，春季种了荒了的军田一百零二亩，除去垫本与交公粮外收获二十石粮食，秋天又种了四十五亩麦子。邓玉林还与本村没劳力抗属刘增禄拨工生产，今年春天邓玉林让他弟弟自动的给刘增禄耕了两天地，刘增禄家中知道后织了两匹布作了一双大鞋给邓玉林送去，因为邓玉林家中没有做针线活的人，他收到这些东西后又给刘增禄家中送去一部分棉花，今年一年他们就这样拨工作活，两家的土地种的都很好，双方的困难也都解决了。
    各村荣军生产小组，还根据自己的条件，进行各种副业生产。宜安五个外籍荣军生产小组，在组长孙保义领导下，开杂货铺、卖豆腐、拉脚，以三斗豆子为资本，每天作四个豆腐，卖完赚一斗豆子，用豆渣喂着两口猪，两个牲口一辆大车拉脚。不能参加其他劳动的人看摊卖货。土山李先文领导的三个人的荣军小铺，两千斤米的资本，从三月到七月赚了六万元（新币，下同）。其他如南营荣军胡庆祥等开店，土山村荣军生产小组熬硝，二区西白村外籍荣军米恒存纺线等。在生产中能作了什么就作什么，大家分工互助生产。
    各区荣军把自己的优抚粮集中了二十万元，在县里开了一个荣誉商店，公营商店并给以帮助扶植，让他们代卖货物。各村荣军生产小组来这里卖货比别人便宜，便利各地荣军作小买卖生产。每个荣军在副业生产中，都分得了不少红利，补助了自己生活，且很富裕。
    三、积极参加与帮助村中各种工作
    各村荣军除努力参加生产外，并积极参加各种工作。土山、宜安、南营、马庄四个村，荣军担任村长、中队长、指导员、支部委员、代表会副主席以及其他干部者即达二十五人，其中有许多人在没有参加部队前即在村中担任工作，到部队上也担任干部，现在又成为地方工作的领导干部。如土山外籍二等荣军高书斌，过去在村中担任武委会主任，到部队上担任指导员，现在在村中又担任中队部指导员。在公粮征收中，他们都很积极的争先交纳，土山村过去二流子荣军耿秃月，不生产不交公粮，今年在别人的推动影响下，也积极参加生产，没有牲口人推水车；过去两年没有交公粮，今年也争先交了。
    四、开展批评与自我批评、改造教育荣军中的个别落后分子
    在生产与各种工作中，对个别落后与不事生产之荣军，通过积极分子的带头，经常给以批评教育。荣军都是在部队上受过教育，经过流血斗争的考验，所以绝大部分是好的，是能够服从领导、接受批评与改正错误的。如土山外籍荣军赵国贤、南营外籍荣军胡庆祥，与地主在一起居住合伙吃饭，袒护地主等；经过批评教育后，都从地主家中搬出来，与地主隔断关系。
    总起来说，藁城工作是有相当成绩的，荣军在参加生产、参加解放区建设上也获得了初步经验，但全县的荣军工作，今后仍需要继续努力开展，并应在组织荣军生产中，注意加强他们的学习领导，使他们从思想上、政治上、文化上更提高一步。另外在荣军小组的生产中，采取集体生产拨工互助收获归各人所有的方式是很好的，但有些还不能按劳力强弱、生产情况适当的换工，今后生产中应注意作到等价交换，才能使荣军的生产互助更加巩固。
