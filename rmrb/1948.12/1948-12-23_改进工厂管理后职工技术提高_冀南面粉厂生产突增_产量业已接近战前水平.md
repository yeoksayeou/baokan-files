　　Improved Factory Management Enhances Workers' Skills
    Ji'nan Flour Mill Sees Production Surge
    Output Nearing Pre-War Levels
    [Our Newspaper] Reporter Tian Liu reports: With the same number of people and the same production conditions, the Ji'nan Flour Mill has seen a rapid increase in both output and quality since November. Its daily output now exceeds that of the enemy and puppet regime period and is approaching pre-war levels. The flour yield from wheat has far exceeded that of the enemy, puppet, and Kuomintang rule. The factory was originally built in 1930, with more than 60 employees and a daily output of over 1,000 bags of flour. After the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, it was bought and forcibly occupied by the enemy, and liberated by the people in October 1947. In the summer of 1946, after the Kuomintang launched an anti-people civil war, the factory was once shut down. It resumed operation in July this year with 82 employees. In the first month (August), the average daily output of flour was 400 bags, 500 bags in September, and jumped to 811 bags in November. On the 5th of this month, the output even surged to 955 bags, exceeding the daily output of 500 bags during the enemy and puppet era and approaching the pre-war level of 1,000 bags per day. In particular, the flour yield from wheat has far exceeded the highest record of 75 or 76 catties during the Kuomintang enemy puppet rule, reaching an average record of 81 or 82 catties; the highest flour yield has reached more than 83 catties, approaching the standard flour yield. The ratio of first and second-class flour has also increased from 2.6 to 7.4 in the past to the current 4.9 to 5.1. Currently (December), due to the increase in output, the increase in flour yield, and the change in the proportion of first and second-class flour, compared with November after the surge in output, the monthly increase in wealth for the people is as high as 1.86 million new yuan.
    These achievements are mainly due to the improved factory management and the dedication and active production of all employees.

　　改进工厂管理后职工技术提高
    冀南面粉厂生产突增
    产量业已接近战前水平
    【本报讯】记者田流报导：在同样人数，同样生产条件下，冀南面粉工厂十一月份以来，产量和质量都迅速的提高，现在每日产量已超过敌伪统治时代和接近战前水平，麦子的产粉量则已远远超过敌伪及国民党统治时期。该厂始建于民国十九年，当时共有职工六十余人，日产面粉千余袋。抗日战争后为敌人收买强占，一九四七年十月为人民解放。一九四六年夏，国民党掀起反人民内战后，该厂曾一度停工，今年七月复工，职工八二人。第一个月（八月份）平均每日产面粉四百袋，九月份五百袋，十一月份跃增至八一一袋，本月五日产量竟突升到九五五袋，超过了敌伪时代每日五百袋的产量，并接近了战前日产千袋的水平。特别是麦子产粉量已经远远超过国民党敌伪统治时代七十五、六斤的最高纪录，而达到八十一、二斤的平均纪录；最高产粉量已达八十三斤多，接近了标准产粉量。头、二等面粉也由过去的二·六比七·四提高到目前的四·九比五·一，目前（十二月份）由于产量的提高、产粉量的增加，和头二等面粉比例的变化，和产量突增后的十一月份比较，因此每月为人民多生产财富即达新币一百八十六万余元。
    这些成绩的获得主要是由于改进了工厂管理，和全体职工的各尽其责，积极生产。
