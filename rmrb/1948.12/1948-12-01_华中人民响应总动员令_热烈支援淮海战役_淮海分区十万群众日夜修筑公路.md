　　Xinhua News Agency, Huaihai Front, 29th -- The people of Central China, responding to the call of local Party and government leading organs, are enthusiastically supporting the People's Liberation Army in the Huaihai Campaign.

　　The Central China Working Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Northern Jiangsu Military Region, and the Central China Administrative Office jointly issued a "General Mobilization Order to Support the Front" on the 13th of this month, calling on all Party members, government personnel, soldiers, civilians, and people's organizations in the area to urgently mobilize to strive for the great victory of the Huaihai Campaign. The general mobilization order requires: all local troops should actively cooperate with the main forces in combat, and in the war zone, they should carry out blocking, pinning down, raiding, blasting, reconnaissance, and guarding, and when the enemy collapses, capture deserters and scattered bandits. Those close to the war zone should seize the opportunity to remove enemy strongholds, kill and wound the enemy, strengthen rear security, and prevent special agent activities. All organs supporting the front lines, as well as workers, peasants, youth, women, and other people's organizations, should mobilize all manpower and material resources to support the front lines, promptly supply the front with grain, grass, and ammunition, quickly rescue and transfer the wounded, help the families of civilian laborers solve their difficulties, and step up production. All rear-area staff should do the work of several people, overcome various difficulties, and complete their tasks. Hospitals should improve their technology to ensure that the wounded recover quickly and return to their teams. Military industrial departments should step up production and improve the quality of shells and bullets, supplying the front lines in a steady stream. Financial departments should regulate materials in a more planned way to ensure the needs of the front lines. Transportation, liaison, and communication departments must not shy away from various difficulties, be prepared quickly, and ensure that modern warfare can be carried out in rural areas with backward transportation conditions. Captive management personnel should strengthen the management and education of captives. Propaganda departments should do a good job in propaganda, so that the broad masses of people understand the significance of this campaign and actively support the front lines. Party committees and government organs at all levels should take supporting the front lines as the central task and put the main force into this work.

　　Under the call of this general mobilization order, when the Huaihai Campaign began, the first batch of more than 37,600 full-time civilian laborers in the Northern Jiangsu area rushed to the front line day and night. After the first batch of more than 8,500 civilian laborers in the Huaihai sub-district (covering eight counties including Lianshui, Suqian, Donghai, and Guanyun) transported tens of millions of catties of military grain to the front line, the second batch of tens of thousands of civilian laborers and tens of thousands of carts are about to depart. The Yanfu sub-district (covering nine counties including Ye Ting, Jianyang, Funing, and Huai'an) also dispatched tens of thousands of carts to transport military grain. Rice mills and hulling mills everywhere rushed to make military rice day and night. The Shengfeng Rice Mill in Qintong County completed 150,000 catties in a surprise attack within ten days due to the special efforts of its workers. In Dagu Township, the men in twelve hulling mills had gone to the front lines to serve, and the women did the hulling, pushing 80,000 catties of rice in eight days. Women, children, and the elderly in the Huaihai sub-district organized various logistics service teams to make military shoes, cotton clothes, grind flour, deliver flour, make bean sprouts, collect grass, and chop firewood to supply the troops. More than 300 women in the Chengdong district of Shuyang County automatically participated in short-distance transportation of grain and grass and the wounded from 15 to 50 li. The women in Central Jiangsu are rushing to make ××0,000 pairs of military shoes. Women in Tongfeng and Jue Ma North districts of Rudong (southeast of Rugao, newly established county) have completed 30,000 pairs of military shoes, guaranteeing at least 24 rows of stitches on the soles, with 52 stitches in each row. Elementary school students in Ye Ting County each plant a certain amount of army-supporting vegetables in preparation for comforting the army. 100,000 men and women in the Huaihai sub-district worked hard day and night to build × roads, build ×× bridges, and build ×× drainage holes on the roadbed. Pine arches with the words "Welcome the People's Liberation Army" were erected on the roads. When the PLA's cars sped by, the masses excitedly said, "Our cars are back again! Chiang Kai-shek is finished!"

　　The soldiers and civilians of the Jianghuai Military Region, who have persisted in fighting behind enemy lines for two years and three months, are also working hard to support the PLA in the Huaihai Front. In Sisu (newly established county between Siyang and Suqian) County alone, more than 5,000 civilian laborers poured into the front lines to serve. After receiving the mobilization order, the county office mobilized 1,000 stretchers, 40 carts, and 100 donkeys overnight to go to the front lines to serve. To strengthen the leadership of the work of supporting the front lines, the deputy secretary of a certain local committee of the Chinese Communist Party concurrently served as the political commissar of the logistics headquarters of the sub-district, and the commissioner and deputy commissioners served as the commander and deputy commander of the logistics. On the 11th of this month, they led important cadres such as the director of the finance department of the commissioner's office, the director of the propaganda department of the local committee, and the director of the women's federation of the sub-district to the front lines to lead this work.
