    Japanese Seamen's Strike Continues to Extend
    Worker Masses Defeat Revisionists at Trade Union Congress
    (Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 10th) Tokyo dispatch: The Japanese seamen's general strike, which began on November 29th, is continuing due to the capitalists' refusal to increase wages by 30 percent. After the first 48-hour strike, the All-Japan Seamen's Union launched a second 72-hour nationwide strike on the 4th. As of 3 p.m. on the 5th, at least 459 ships in 36 ports across Japan had joined the strike, accounting for approximately 70 percent of Japan's shipping tonnage. According to the Japanese Ministry of Transport on the 5th, the seamen's strike has brought Japanese maritime transport to a standstill for the past six days. The second seamen's strike was originally scheduled to end on the 6th, but the All-Japan Seamen's Union headquarters decided to extend it for another 48 hours. According to Kyodo News Agency, the union decided to continue frequent three-day strikes until the Maritime Affairs Committee accepts the wage increase demand.
    (Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 10th) TASS Moscow, 5th: The Labor Daily recently published an article commenting that the National Congress of the Japanese Federation of Industrial Labor Unions proved the fighting spirit and the desire for unity of the Japanese working masses, causing the revisionists to suffer defeat at the congress. The author wrote that the reactionary leadership of the American Federation of Labor, acting on orders from the State Department, had provided both spiritual and material support to the revisionists, but to no avail. The right-wing Socialists have lost their influence in the labor ranks. Their divisive policies have led to their failure. The unions are increasingly actively participating in Japan's democratic camp, fighting for peace, freedom, democracy, and national independence.
    Note: The Japanese Federation of Industrial Labor Unions is Japan's largest progressive labor organization, with nearly three million members. At its Fourth Congress held in Tokyo on November 19th, the union passed a resolution by an absolute majority condemning a small number of right-wing splitters and expelled the three top leaders of the right-wing splitters from membership.

    日海员罢工继续延长
    工人群众在产联大会上击败修正派
    【新华社陕北十日电】东京消息：十一月二十九日开始的日本海员大罢工，因资方拒绝增加工资百分之三十的要求，正在继续坚持中。在第一次四十八小时罢工结束后，全日海员工会又于四日开始了第二次七十二小时的全国性罢工，迄五日下午三时止，日本各地三十六处港口内，至少已有四百五十九艘以上的船只参加了罢工，约占日本船舶吨位百分之七十左右。据日本政府运输省五日宣称，海员罢工已使过去六天中日本海上运输陷入停顿状态。第二次海员罢工本定六日结束，其后，全日海员工会总部又决定将继续再延长四十八小时。另据共同通讯社称，该工会决继续频频进行每次三日的罢工，直至海务委员会接受增资要求为止。
    【新华社陕北十日电】据塔斯社莫斯科五日讯：劳动报顷著文评称：日本产业劳动组合联合会的全国代表大会，证明了日本工人群众的战斗情绪与要求团结的意志，使修正派在这个大会上遭受了失败。作者写道，按照国务院命令行事的美国劳工联合会的反动领导机关曾结予修正派以精神及物资两方面的支持，但仍然无补于事。右翼社会党人已丧失了在劳工队伍中的影响。他们的分裂政策使他们失败了。各工会愈来愈积极地参加日本的民主阵营，为争取和平、自由、民主及民族独立而斗争。
    按：日本产业劳动组合联合会，是日本最大的进步劳工组织，拥有会员近三百万人。该工会十一月十九日在东京召开的第四届代表大会上，曾以绝对多数通过谴责少数右翼分裂分子的决议，并将右翼分裂分子的最高领袖三人开除会籍。
