Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 4th. The Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party sent a congratulatory message on the liberation of Xuzhou. The telegram stated: To Comrades Liu Bocheng, Chen Yi, Deng Xiaoping, Rao Shushi, Zhang Yunyi, Su Yu, Tan Zhenlin, Chen Geng, and all comrades of the East China Field Army and the Central Plains Field Army:

　　Congratulations on your great victory in liberating Xuzhou. Xuzhou is the gateway to Nanjing and a huge military base for the bandit chieftain Chiang Kai-shek to carry out counter-revolutionary civil war. The rapid liberation of Xuzhou is extremely beneficial to the overall war situation. We hope you will continue your efforts to completely annihilate the enemy troops in front of you.

　　The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, December 2, 1948.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Huaihai Front, 4th. Chiang Kai-shek's most important Xuzhou defense line in the southern front has completely collapsed. The People's Liberation Army has liberated Xuzhou and is fiercely pursuing the fleeing enemy. After the People's Liberation Army completely annihilated Huang Botao's Corps in the Nianzhuang area east of Xuzhou, Qiu Qingquan's 2nd Corps, Li Mi's 13th Corps, and Sun Yuanliang's 16th Corps, originally stationed in Xuzhou to reinforce Huang, turned south and attempted to reinforce Huang Wei's Corps, which was being besieged by the People's Liberation Army in the area southwest of Suxian, in order to join forces and flee south together. From November 26th to 30th, for five days, this group of bandits suffered a strong counterattack from the powerful forces of the People's Liberation Army along the Gushanjie, Yangzhuang, and Zhangjie line, 30 li south of Xuzhou, engaging in fierce battles on the 200-li-wide defensive line. The bandits, under the cover of dozens of tanks and airplanes, rushed east and west, but were repelled by our army. Our forward positions were repeatedly contested, lost and regained, but our army's positions remained unmoved. By December 1st, the bandit army had suffered thousands of casualties and was forced to abandon its plan to flee south, abandoning the besieged Huang Wei Corps and turning west to flee. One part of the People's Liberation Army entered Xuzhou at 10 p.m. on the 1st, while another part is rushing to pursue the enemy.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Ping-Sui Front, 4th. A unit of the North China People's Liberation Army launched an attack on the outer strongholds of Zhangjiakou, the heartland of the bandit Fu. On November 29th and 30th, they successively recovered Wanquan County (old city) northwest of Zhangjiakou, Huaian County southwest of Zhangjiakou, Guoleizhuang and Chaigoubao directly west of Zhangjiakou, and Gongweizhen and other towns directly south of Zhangjiakou. In the above battles, in addition to killing and wounding the enemy, more than 830 people, including the head of the Wanquan County Security Regiment, were captured alive. The bandit Fu in Zhangjiakou launched a counterattack on Wanquan and the Shenjingzhen position 30 li west of Zhangjiakou on the 1st, but were repelled, and the invading bandits suffered heavy casualties. As the main force of the People's Liberation Army marched towards Zhangjiakou in the eastern section of the Ping-Sui Railway, our army in western Sui withdrew from Baotou City on the 28th of last month.

　　North China Dispatch: In western Tianjin, our local armed militia successively recovered important strongholds of the Chiang bandits such as Yangfengang and Wangqingtuo, 40 li west of Tianjin, on the 20th and 24th of last month. The defending enemies fled eastward. We seized more than 200,000 jin of grain and a portion of military supplies.

　　中共中央电贺徐州解放  张垣外围我克万全怀安
    【新华社陕北四日电】中共中央电贺解放徐州。电称：刘伯承、陈毅、邓小平、饶漱石、张云逸、粟裕、谭震林、陈赓诸同志及华东野战军中原野战军全体同志们：
    庆祝你们解放徐州的伟大胜利。徐州是南京的门户，是匪首蒋介石进行反革命内战的巨大军事基地，徐州的迅速解放，对于全国战局，极为有利。尚望继续努力为全歼当面匪军而奋斗。
    中国共产党中央委员会　一九四八年十二月二日
    【新华社淮海前线四日电】蒋介石在南线最重要的徐州防线已全部崩溃，解放军已解放徐州，并正猛追逃敌。自解放军在徐州以东碾庄地区全歼黄伯韬兵团后，原驻徐州、图增援黄匪的邱清泉部二兵团，李弥部十三兵团及孙元良部十六兵团即转头南窜，企图增援在宿县西南地区正被解放军围歼的黄维兵团，以便于会合后一起向南逃跑。自十一月二十六日至三十日五天中，该股匪军在徐州以南三十华里的孤山集、杨庄、张集一线，遭受解放军强大部队的坚强阻击，在东西二百里的阻击阵地上，进行激战。匪军在数十辆坦克与飞机掩护下，东奔西突，均被我军击退。我军前哨阵地经反复争夺，失而复得，而我军之阵地屹然未动。激战至十二月一日，匪军伤亡数千，乃被迫放弃南逃的计划，丢下被围的黄维兵团，扭头向西逃跑。解放军一部于一日晚十时进占徐州，另部正兼程向敌猛追中。
    【新华社平绥前线四日电】华北人民解放军一部，向傅匪心脏地区张家口外围据点发起进击，十一月二十九、三十两日相继收复张家口西北的万全县城（旧城）、西南的怀安县城、正西的郭磊庄、柴沟堡及正南的工卫镇等城镇多处。上述战斗中，除毙伤外，共生俘万全县保安团团长以下八百三十余人。张家口傅匪曾于一日向万全及张家口西三十里之深井镇阵地反扑，均被击退，犯匪伤亡惨重。由于人民解放军主力向平绥东段张家口一带进军，绥西我军已于上月二十八日撤出包头市。
    【华北电】津西我地武民兵，于上月二十、二十四两日，先后收复天津以西四十华里之杨汾港、王庆坨等蒋匪重要据点，守敌东窜。我缴获粮食二十余万斤，军用品一部。
