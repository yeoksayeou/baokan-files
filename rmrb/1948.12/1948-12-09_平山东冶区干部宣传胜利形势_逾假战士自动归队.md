　　Eastern Metallurgical District Cadres in Pingshan Publicize Victorious Situation; Overstayed Soldiers Voluntarily Return to Unit
    [This newspaper reports] After receiving instructions from higher authorities regarding the return of soldiers who had overstayed their leave, cadres in the Dongye Village of the First District of Pingshan in the Northern Yue region, in conjunction with village cadres, held a symposium for overstayed soldiers. The district cadres first reported on the current victorious situation of the Liberation War, and said, "Comrades have worked hard killing enemies in the army in the past, and now that you have returned, you should stay longer. However, due to the needs of today's work, we have to send comrades back to their glorious posts as soon as possible. Those who are truly sick should not force themselves; if there are difficulties at home or your own difficulties, and if you have any opinions on the village cadres or work, please raise them, and the village will solve them. If the village can't solve it, go to the district." Among the eleven overstayed soldiers, two were sick and stayed behind, and the remaining nine comrades expressed their willingness to return to the unit. Comrade Yang Jinzhu's mother and wife were listening outside the door, and heard Yang Jinzhu say, "I am very willing to return to the unit, I have no objection." His mother lifted the curtain and said, "You have no objection, but I do. My family had a little grandson in June, and the village cadres didn't count him in my family's population." After the discussion, the village head immediately apologized for his carelessness in his work. He said, "We should check the village's collection work to see if anyone else has been missed." Then, other comrades raised their own opinions, and the district cadres and village cadres gave patient answers. They also said to the soldiers who were returning to the unit, "Comrades can rest assured at the front, and we will try our best to solve any difficulties at home." The next day, the village head informed the returning comrades to eat lunch at the village office and then line up to go to the district. Everyone moved very quickly and departed in just over an hour.
    The main reasons for the successful completion of this work are the village cadres' responsibility and patience in listening to the opinions of the masses, and the district cadres' democratic style and pragmatic spirit, which are worthy of learning by other cadres. (Ziming)

　　平山东冶区干部宣传胜利形势
  　逾假战士自动归队
    【本报讯】北岳区平山一区东冶村，接到上级关于逾假战士归队的号召后，区干部即在该村协同村干部召开逾假战士座谈会，首先由区干部报告目前解放战争的胜利形势，并说：“同志们过去在部队上杀敌已经很辛苦了，现在回来了应当留下多住一个时期才对，但是因为今天的工作需要，咱们只好欢送同志们赶快回到自己光荣的工作岗位去，真正有病的就不要勉强；家里有困难及自己有困难的，对村里的干部及工作有什么意见都提出来，村里解决不了的去区里解决。”在十一个逾假战士同志中有两个有病便留下了，其余九个同志都表示自己愿意归队。杨金竹同志的娘和他的老婆在门外听着，只听得杨金竹说：“归队我很愿意，我没有意见。”他娘把门帘一掀说：“你没意见，我可有意见，我家六月里添个小孙子，村干部没给我家计人口。”谈完以后，村长马上检讨了自己在工作上的马虎，他说：“咱该把村里这次征收工作检查一番，看是否还遗漏了别人。”接着，别的同志都提了自己的意见，区干部与村干部都作了耐心的答复。并对归队战士们说：“同志们在前方可以放心，家里有困难尽量设法解决。第二天村长通知归队同志在村公所吃午饭后整队到区，大家的动作都很迅速，只一个多钟头就出发了。
    这一工作顺利完成的主要原因，是村干部负责耐心听取群众的意见，及区干部的民主作风和实事求是的精神所致，值得其他干部学习。（自鸣）
