　　Earnestly Mobilizing the Masses to Find Solutions
  　Xiyang Solved the Difficulties of Ending Land Reform
    [Taihang News] In Xiyang, during the ending of land reform, some districts and villages earnestly mobilized the masses, clarified the purpose of the policies, and the masses automatically solved the difficulties of compensation and resettlement, so that the task of ending land reform could be successfully completed, achieving the goal of unity and production. For example, the West Main Street of Nanguan in Xiyang is a semi-urban and semi-rural area with little land and a large population. Many people are engaged in industry and commerce for their livelihoods. Since the land reform movement, cadres and the masses have not clearly understood the purpose of land reform. Regardless of the specific circumstances, land was distributed based on the concept of "absolute equality," resulting in those who could farm and needed land lacking it, while those who could not farm and did not need it as much were allocated land, significantly limiting the development of various industries. This time, when ending land reform, in the discussion of the source of compensation, some people initially advocated using the burden account as the standard, drawing from those above the average standard. Although some people said this was not good, most people believed that the problem could not be solved otherwise. The district leaders immediately explained the policies to guide everyone to discuss, and unanimously clarified the purpose of ending land reform, which was to develop production, not to hinder production; however, the village's approach did not meet this purpose. Merchants could not farm, farmers could not engage in business, and land distribution was mechanical "one share." For example, Han Liuxiao (businessman) could not distinguish between millet and sorghum but was also asked to farm, "He originally had no feathers, but they asked him to fly all over the sky." Everyone said, "Each trade is like a separate mountain," and if it is not distributed according to needs, neither farming, industry, nor commerce can be done well. After these issues were raised, some said: "Whoever is higher is drawn from, who would dare to rise!" Some said: "Do what you can, there are many ways to get rich!" Carpenter Qian Heng said: "My family has ten people and two laborers. My brother is a dyer, and I am a carpenter. We can't farm the land we are allocated. Hiring people to farm is not in line with the account. Since we were allocated land, it has been difficult for me." Zhao Wuwu interrupted him and said: "I am the same as you. Last year I was away, and my family hired short-term workers to farm. In the autumn, I owed five dan of corn in equivalent wages. After calculating, even if the harvest in the field is good, it can barely be enough. It would be better to simply give my land to the farmers, and the village can give me some capital to do business, which is much better than farming." In this way, five households contributed a total of 18.8 mu of land, and Nanguan also contributed more than 30 mu. In addition to compensating for resettlement, there were still more than ten mu left, ready to be allocated to farmers. In this way, without touching the land of other farmers, the problems of compensation, resettlement and allocation were solved, and at the same time, various industries were given the opportunity to develop. The masses said: This is truly "the best of both worlds."
    In addition, when looking for the source of "making up the deficit" in the Fourth District, because of the full mobilization, everyone came up with ideas. If there was not enough land, they organized land reclamation to solve the difficulties of compensation and resettlement. Two-thirds of the villages in the district did this. For example, Sheng organized a group of 58 people who reclaimed more than 40 mu of wasteland in six days, with each worker receiving three sheng of corn (paid from the fruit grain). This not only solved the difficulties of compensation and resettlement, but also earned wages for the masses, and also expanded the cultivated area. The masses were very satisfied, and the production enthusiasm of all classes was high. (Jiu Yun, Mang Xiao, Qiu Yi)

　　认真发动群众想办法
  　昔阳解决了结束土改的困难
    【太行讯】昔阳在结束土改中，有些区村认真发动了群众，明确了政策目的，群众自动解决补偿安置困难，使结束土改任务得以顺利完成，达到团结生产的目的。如昔阳南关西大街，是一种半城半乡性质，地少人多，不少群众经营工商业生活。土改运动以来，干部群众对土改目的性认识都不明确，不顾具体情况，以“绝对平”的观点分配土地，致会种地需要地的人缺地，不会种不太需要地的人却分了地，相当限制了各行各业的发展。此次结束土改，在讨论补偿来源时，开始有些人主张以负担帐为准，高出平均标准即抽，虽有部分人说这样不好，但大多数人认为不这样就解决不了问题。区领导上当即讲明政策诱导大家讨论，一致明确了结束土改的目的，是发展生产，不是妨碍生产；而本村的作法却不合这目的，商人种不了地，农人干不了买卖，分地却是机械的“一份”。如韩留小（经商）黍和稷都分不清也要他种地，“本来没毛叫他满天飞”。大家说：“隔行如隔山”，不按需要分，农、工、商那行也干不好。提出这些问题后，有的说：“谁高抽谁，那谁还敢上升哩！”有的说：“能干甚干甚，发家致富门路多哩！”木工千恒就说：“我家十口人两个劳力，我哥是染匠，我是木匠，分下地种不了，用人耕种不合帐，自从分下地可把我难住了。”赵五文打断他的话说：“我和你一样，去年我在外，家里用短工种地，秋后欠了等价工资五石玉茭，合算了一下，地里收的好了，能凑够。这样不如把我的地干脆给农民，村里给我几个资本干个买卖，比种地强的多。”这样一来，有五户共拿出地十八·八亩，南关也拿出三十多亩。这些地除补偿安置外，还余十来亩，准备给农民调剂。这样没动其他农民土地，解决了补偿安置调剂的问题，同时各行各业也得到发展机会，群众说：这真是“两全其美”。
    另外，在四区找“补绽”来源时，因经过充分发动，大家起来想办法。地土不够，就组织开荒解决补偿安置困难。全区有三分之二村庄这样作。如升组织了一组共五十八人，六天开荒四十余亩，每工玉茭三升（从果实粮中开支）。这样不但解决了补偿安置困难，群众也赚下工资，同时也扩大了耕地面积，群众十分满意，各阶层生产情绪高涨。（九云、忙小、秋义）
