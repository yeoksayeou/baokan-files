Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th—The Kuomintang government's currency reform "revised" measures have only been in effect for a month, and the counterfeit Gold Yuan is already depreciating rapidly. According to a United Press report from Nanjing: as of the 12th of this month, the black market price of gold in Nanjing had risen to 3,000 yuan per tael (counterfeit Gold Yuan, same below), 200% higher than the "revised" price of 1,000 yuan per tael, and 15 times the official price of 200 yuan per tael at the time of the "currency reform." The price of silver dollars has risen to 40 yuan each, 300% higher than the "revised" price of 10 yuan each, and 19 times higher than the official price of 2 yuan each at the time of the "currency reform." Due to the rapid depreciation of the counterfeit Gold Yuan, there has been a rush to buy gold and silver dollars in Nanjing. The spokesman for the Nanjing Chiang Kai-shek Police Department also admitted on the 13th that "citizens value silver more than currency" and "the black market is rampant." Kuomintang Finance Minister Xu Kan was forced to hurriedly convene a meeting of financial, economic, and garrison authorities and legislators on the 11th of this month to "discuss this situation." A large number of Nanjing police were dispatched, attempting to violently crack down on the black market activities of gold and silver.

At the same time, prices in Shanghai have risen again. According to Reuters: Since the 11th, the Shanghai market has shown a "strong trend." The prices of cotton yarn, soap, cigarettes, silk, medicines, and industrial chemicals have all risen. The black market price of Yong'an Textile stocks on the 11th has risen to 4,000 counterfeit Gold Yuan, more than 54% higher than the price of 2,600 yuan on the 10th.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 12th—According to a TASS report on the 8th, citing Shanghai newspapers: Factories under the rule of the Kuomintang bandit gang in Shanghai are constantly closing down, and a large number of workers are unemployed. In recent weeks, thousands of workers have been unemployed due to the closure of several tobacco companies. The closure of tobacco companies will threaten the livelihoods of 60,000 workers. Tobacco industry workers have sent representatives to petition the Shanghai Kuomintang municipal authorities.

  　上海股票一天上涨百分之五十四
    【新华社陕北十六日电】国民党政府币改“修正”办法公布仅及一月，伪金圆券又在猛烈贬值。据合众社南京消息：截至本月十二日，南京黑市黄金每两已涨达三千元（伪金圆券，下同），　高出币改“修正”办法规定价格每两一千元的百分之二百，为“币改”时官价每两二百元的十五倍。银元每元则涨达四十元，高出币改“修正”办法规定价格每元十元的百分之三百，较之“币改”时官价每元二元则高出十九倍。由于伪金圆券之迅速贬值，南京已发生争购黄金及银元的风潮。南京蒋匪警察厅发言人亦于十三日供认：“市民重银轻币”“黑市日形猖獗”。国民党财政部长徐堪则被迫于本月十一日慌忙召集财政、经济及警备当局、立委举行会议，“讨论此一情势”。南京警察大批出动，妄图暴力取缔金银黑市活动。
    与此同时，上海物价又作新的上涨，据路透社消息：自十一日起，上海市场即呈“坚挺现象”，棉纱、肥皂、纸烟、丝、药品、工业化学品的价格均在上涨。永安纺织股票十一日黑市价已涨至伪金圆券四千元，较十日的价格二千六百元上涨百分之五十四以上。
    【新华社陕北十二日电】据塔斯社八日电引沪报消息：国民党匪帮统治下的上海工厂不断倒闭，大量工人失业。在近几周内，由于若干烟草公司的停业，已有数千工人失业。烟草公司的停业，将威胁到六万工人的生计。烟草业工人曾派出代表向上海国民党市当局请愿。
