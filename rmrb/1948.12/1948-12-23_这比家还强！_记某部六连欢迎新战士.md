　　“This is even better than home!”
    ——A record of a certain unit's sixth company welcoming new recruits
    When the Sixth Company heard that new recruits were coming, they immediately busied themselves, as if preparing for a joyous event. Yang Shenglu, Cai Qingfa, and Gao Liang of the third squad were busy tidying up the house, pasting windows, and building bunks.
    The soldiers would ask the instructor whenever they met him: "Why haven't the new comrades arrived yet?"
    Early in the morning of December 1st, as soon as they heard that the new recruits had arrived, the soldiers rushed to the company gate like a swarm of bees, waiting. As the platoon leader and deputy platoon leader led the new comrades out of the gate, the soldiers surrounded them from all sides.
    "Platoon leader, give me the backpack!"
    "Give it to me, platoon leader!"
    "Damn it, you're already carrying two, and you still want more?"
    Those who didn't manage to grab a backpack started asking the new comrades questions, one after another.
    "You must be tired!"
    "Aren't you cold?"
    "We've been waiting anxiously for you!"
    The new comrades didn't know who to answer. They just grinned.
    The company commander and instructor asked the cooks to stir-fry mutton and invited the ten new comrades to the company headquarters for a meal to express their welcome. The new comrades were so happy that they couldn't say anything, only saying: "Company commander, you're too kind, too kind..."
    Back in the squad, one found a stool, another fetched hot water. Squad leader Zhang Dequan of the fifth squad took out his own money to buy cigarettes to treat the new comrades. Squad leader Zhang Shuqing of the seventh squad said: "The new comrades don't have cloth wrappers to wrap their things, I'll give them my cloth wrapper." Lu Fucai said: "I don't have money or anything. The new comrades have come from afar and have been traveling for many days. Their clothes are dirty, I'll give them my clothes to change into, and I'll wash theirs clean. Consider it my little gesture!" Hao Faxing, Gao Liang, and Yang Shenglu of the third squad each took out a set of underwear. There were only two new comrades, making it difficult to decide who should have them.
    The veteran comrades accompanied them to meals and haircuts; whenever they had time, they would introduce the company's combat, study, merit, mutual aid, food, and discipline... The new comrades said: "The People's Liberation Army is just great!"
    In the evening, the veteran soldiers of the fourth squad held a welcome party, asked the two new comrades to sit on stools, and the squad leader gave a speech on behalf of the whole squad to express their welcome. The whole squad then stood in front of them and sang a welcome song for them.
    The new comrades all said: "Being in the army is even better than being at home!" They felt very natural, and the next day they automatically and actively asked for work. New recruit Li Mingshan had dysentery, and Wang Wenshan had a sore foot, but still scrambled to feed the horses, walk the livestock, and carry water... Whenever there was work, the veteran and new comrades would rush to do it. The veteran comrades said: "You've just arrived and haven't had a rest yet. After you've slowly learned and rested, it won't be too late to do it!" The new comrades said: "You're taking care of us too thoughtfully. We feel bad if we don't work!"
    The new comrades of the sixth squad automatically made five plans on the second day of arriving at the squad:
    One, settle down and work.
    Two, obey orders.
    Three, don't complain when there are difficulties.
    Four, be united with all comrades, don't be arrogant.
    Five, don't violate mass discipline.
    And said: "Everyone is so good to us, we will definitely work hard and are determined to defeat Chiang Kai-shek together with you!"

　　“这比家还强！”
    ——记某部六连欢迎新战士
    六连听说要来新战士，马上忙起来了，好象要办喜事一样。三班的杨生禄、蔡庆发、高亮忙着收拾房子、糊窗户、搭铺。
    战士们遇见指导员就问：“新同志怎还不来？”
    十二月一号清早，一听说新战士来了，战士们就一窝蜂似地跑到连部门口等着，正副排长领着新同志一出大门，战士们就前后左右包围上来了。
    “排长，背包给我！”
    “给我，排长！”
    “妈的，你背两个了，还要？”
    没抢到背包的，就向新同志你一句我一句问起来了。
    “可辛苦啦！”
    “不冷吧？”
    “可把咱们盼坏了！”
    弄得新同志不知回答谁好。只是咧着嘴笑。
    连长指导员叫炊事班炒了羊肉菜，把十位新同志请到连部吃饭，表示欢迎。新同志高兴得说不出啥，只会说：“连长太好了，太好了……”
    回到班上。这个找凳子，那个打开水。五班长张德全拿出自己的钱买纸烟招待新同志，七班长张树清说：“新同志来了，没有包袱皮包东西，我把我的包袱皮给他们包东西。”陆福才说：“咱没钱，也没东西。新同志远道来，走了许多天，衣裳脏了，把我的衣裳给他们替换下来，我把他们的给洗干净。算我的一点小意思吧！”三班郝发兴、高亮、杨生禄三个人每人拿出一套内衣，新同志只两个人，弄得不知换谁的好。
    吃饭剃头老同志都陪他们去；一有空就给他们介绍连队战斗、学习、立功、互助、伙食、纪律……的情况，新同志说：“解放军就是好！”
    晚上，四班的老战士开欢迎会，叫两个新同志坐在凳子上，班长代表全班讲话表示欢迎，全班又站在他俩面前，给他们唱欢迎歌。
    新同志都说：“到了部队，比在家还强！”他们感到很自然，第二天就自动积极要求工作。新战士李明山拉痢疾，王文山脚疼还抢着喂马、遛牲口、担水……每次有工作，新老同志就抢着干。老同志说：“你们刚来，还没歇过来，等慢慢学会了，也歇过来再做不迟！”新同志说：“你们照顾咱们太周到了，不干工作心里过不去！”
    六班的新同志到班上第二天就自动订了五条计划：
    一、安心工作。
    二、服从命令。
    三、有了困难不说二话。
    四、对全体同志团结，不耍态度。
    五、不犯群众纪律。
    并说：“大家对我们这样好，我们一定好好干，决心和你们一道打垮蒋介石！”
