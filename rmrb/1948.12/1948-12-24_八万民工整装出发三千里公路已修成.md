　　【Urgent Telegram from Central Hebei】In order to liberate Peiping and Tientsin and completely annihilate the Chiang-Fu bandit troops, the people of the entire Central Hebei region are enthusiastically supporting the front lines on an unprecedented and massive scale, with tremendous momentum. The highways crisscrossing Central Hebei, stretching over three thousand li, have been largely completed by the villagers along the roadsides working day and night until × day of this month. Stretchers, carts, and other equipment have also been organized. According to incomplete statistics, 203 stretcher companies and 100 militia companies have been organized in various places, preparing more than 4,000 stretchers and more than 7,000 carts, totaling more than 80,000 people. Among them, 45 companies have already marched to the front lines, and the rest are waiting for orders to depart. Various places have also conducted preliminary reorganization, training, and reviews. Qinghebei, Tsinwu, and other counties have reorganized four types of task forces. Jiahe District 1 reviewed the stretcher bearers and civilian laborers from various districts on December 10th. During the review, the militiamen from various villages who were present were all young men in their twenties and thirties, carrying stretchers and backpacks, with neat formations and high morale. A representative of the civilian laborers from Balizhuang said on the podium at the review ground: "We are ready, just waiting for the higher authorities to issue the mobilization order." A cadre from Li Temple Village said: "We will leave immediately when told." Kong Qinggui from the city said: "We guarantee that no one will fall behind after departure." The transport team of 135 carts in Xianjiao County has been organized. Three stretcher companies also conducted a review on the 6th.

    In order to ensure the food supply for the People's Liberation Army, the masses in various places are enthusiastically paying and transporting public grain and milling rice for the front-line troops. At the beginning of this month, most of the public grain in various places had been paid, and large quantities of grain have been continuously transported to the front lines.

    【冀中急电】为解放平津，全歼蒋傅匪军，冀中全区人民，正以空前巨大的规模，踊跃支援前线，声势极为浩壮。纵横交错在冀中境内长达三千余里之公路，在公路两侧村庄星夜抢修下，截至本月×日，已大体修筑完毕。担架、大车等并已编制就绪。据不完整统计，各地已组织好二百零三个担架连，一百个民兵连，备好转运担架四千余副，大车七千余辆共约八万余人。其中四十五个连已开赴前线，其余的正待命出发。各地事先并进行了整编集训检阅，大清河北津武等县则整顿了四种任务队。交河一区在十二月十日就检阅了各区担架民工。检阅时，各村到场的民兵，都是二、三十岁的小伙子，扛着担架，背着被子，行列整齐，情绪激昂。八里庄的民工代表在检阅场的讲台上说：“我们早准备好了，就等上级下动员令了。”李寺村的干部说：“说马上走就马上走。”城里孔庆贵说：“保证出征后不出一个掉队的。”献交县一百三十五辆大车的运输队，已经组织好了。三个担架连也在六号实行了检阅，民工们掀起了支前竞赛，班和班定出公约：“不完成任务不回家。”
    为保证解放军的粮食供应，各地群众均踊跃缴纳运送公粮，为前方部队碾米。本月初各地公粮即大部缴纳完毕，大批的粮食，已源源运往前线。津南五区已备好柴火五十万斤，沈青庄布置了二万斤，该村群众自动准备了三万斤。全区人民正以无限兴奋愉快心情，投入解放平津的大战中。
