How to Motivate Children to Attend School?

Recently, according to education work reports from Huguan County in the Taihang region and materials from individual elementary schools in Lucheng, Pingshun, Shexian, and Shahe counties, significant achievements have been made in mobilizing children to attend school due to the teachers in these schools genuinely understanding and promoting the new educational policy. These are compiled and introduced for reference in various regions.

A survey of twenty-one elementary schools in the second district of Huguan showed that in June, the number of children attending school accounted for only 28% of school-age children. After promoting and educating about the new policy, the number of children attending school in July reached 69.5% of school-age children. In Nanyanghu Village, the figure increased from 25% in June to 87% in July. In Huangshan Village, it increased from only 13% in June to 71% in July.

Statistics from 245 elementary schools in five districts of Huguan County showed that in July, 33 schools had over 90% of school-age children in attendance; 61 schools had over 80%; 65 schools had over 70%; 43 schools had over 60%; 22 schools had over 50%; 13 schools had over 40%; 8 schools had over 30%; and none had below 30%.

In Lucheng Zhai Dian Experimental Elementary School, the number of students regularly attending school in the spring was only a dozen or twenty. In July, the number of students regularly attending school reached over ninety.

In Siziyan Village, Eighth District of Shexian, there are 82 school-age children. In the past, the number of students was small and attendance was irregular. After the policy was promoted and implemented, the number of children attending school in September reached 64, and they were able to attend regularly.

In Cejing, Gaozhuang, Jiagou, Kangchuan, Nanshgang, Bushigou and other villages in the Second District of Shahe, the enrollment of children has also increased from very few to over 50% of school-age children.

Sunjialing in the Second District of Pingshun is a very scattered small mountain village, which has always been "schools without students," but it has also achieved results. In September, 31 children were enrolled, and more than twenty attended regularly. Some of these children have to walk five or six miles.

From the materials, the following common major steps and methods have enabled these schools to achieve such results:

(1) The teachers genuinely understood the new policy. First of all, the teachers in these schools had undergone county and district training. During the training, they studied the policy carefully and deeply reviewed their past work. They realized that the main purpose for the masses to provide their children with their hard-earned money to attend school was to "learn to read and write, and be able to write and calculate." In the past, too much emphasis was placed on production, entertainment, and social activities, neglecting the students' cultural learning, so that students could not recognize many characters, which was precisely contrary to the demands of the masses. This is the most central link among various reasons why children do not attend school and the masses do not care about schools. Because the teachers truly understood the new policy, they recognized that only the implementation of this policy could solve the difficulty of "children not attending school" and were determined to mobilize children to attend school by promoting and implementing the policy. This is a decisive step in achieving results. It can also be said to be a prerequisite.

(2) Repeatedly publicize, sincerely review, and make guarantees. Because they had a clear understanding in their minds after studying, they knew that even if something was completely beneficial to the masses and met their requirements, the masses' minds must be cleared before it could be accomplished. They went to the villages and used various opportunities and methods (such as village cadre forums, parent forums, mass meetings, individual visits, casual talks, etc.) to repeatedly promote and explain the new policy to the masses, sincerely reviewing the past mistakes of the schools, and guaranteeing to the masses that they would be able to teach students to read and calculate in the future. After such publicity, review, and guarantees, some of the masses quickly accepted it and automatically sent their children to school. For example, an old man in the South Street of Lucheng Zhai Dian Village, after listening to the teacher's promotion of the new policy, knew that he could study and recognize characters well after going to school, so he sent his daughter to school. He also said to others: "I have been illiterate for generations. I have always wanted my children to go to school to learn some characters, but in the past few years, the schools only engaged in production and Yangko dances, and could not recognize characters, so I have never let my children go to school." The teachers and education committee members publicized the policy from door to door, and mobilized seven or eight children to attend school in half a day. The father of student Ren Minsheng said: "It is a serious matter to ask children to study. As long as they can study, how can I not let him go?" So he sent his child to school.

After the teachers in Shahe Cejing Southwest Street returned to the village from training and conveyed the policy to the village cadres and the masses, the village cadres and the masses were very satisfied and repaired the school and bought supplies. Jia Dingyi, director of the Farmers' Association, and Zhang Fengyi, member of the Education Committee, personally helped repair the house. Parents sent their children to school one after another and earnestly instructed the teachers to strictly discipline the children to study hard. Li Guiyun said to the teacher: "Teacher! I will let my child go to school with you. If he doesn't study hard, you must patiently guide him."

When the teachers in Nanyanghu Village, Huguan, were promoting the policy, they saw that the masses were not very convinced, so they suggested to the parents that as long as the children enrolled in school, they would guarantee progress every day. Some parents were willing to send their children to school.

Although there are still many people who are skeptical and wait-and-see, they have also begun to pay attention to whether the school can be run well, and have eliminated the indifferent attitude.

(3) Teach the existing students well and show the results to the parents. These teachers saw from the publicity that it was not easy to gain the trust of all the masses by relying solely on publicity. It was necessary to prove it with practical results after the publicity. Therefore, they adopted the method of publicizing on the one hand and seriously teaching the students who had been mobilized to recognize characters and arithmetic on the other hand, and letting the students show their learning results (such as the characters recognized every day, the calligraphy written, the arithmetic learned, etc.) to their parents, so as to persuade the masses with facts, and the masses voluntarily sent their children to school, which was more effective.

For example, in Nanyanghu Village, Second District of Huguan, after a part of the students were mobilized through publicity, the method of teaching one well when they came was immediately implemented, so that the children could recognize several characters every day, and the children had to report to their parents every day when they returned home. Parent Gao Ying was happy to say to the neighbors when she saw that her child could learn some characters every day: "My Routan has to write a stone slate of characters for me every day when he comes back. If this is the case, I still plan to let him go to high school." Maolin's mother saw that other people's children recognized characters after going to school, and said to others: "Now the school is different from the past. I have to let my Maolin go to school." After student Ren Juhao's father saw the calligraphy written by his child, he liked it and said to his child: "If you can write such characters, you can't delay your schooling in the future." In this way, the parents were inspired to send their children to school one after another. The number of students increased day by day. In August, there were 161 students enrolled out of 183 school-age children in the whole village, and more than 120 students were able to attend regularly. The father of Xiao Yang Gong Minggen said when he saw this situation: "According to this school, the children can recognize characters. I will not let my Minggen graze sheep, but I will also let him go to school."

Wang Meihua, a student at Lucheng Zhai Dian Elementary School, recites books to her mother every day. Her mother said to her aunt: "Let your Tuzhi go to school. The current school looks like a real school."

After Shexian Siziyan Elementary School summarized a small section of learning and sent the results to the parents, the parents were very concerned. Gao Liming personally went to the school to say to the teacher: "Teacher, I will give you the money for buying a cow and ask him to study hard. I will bear the burden of the family!" Parent Li Shuanggu said: "Now the teachers in the school do not beat or scold, and the children can still recognize characters. It's really good. I have to let my Jin Suo study hard."

When the masses in Dongchuan Village, Third District of Huguan, saw that the children could recognize characters, they sent their children to school one after another. Of the 40 school-age children in the whole village, 37 were enrolled.

　　怎样动员儿童入了学？
    最近从太行壶关县教育工作报告和潞城、平顺、涉县、沙河等县的个别小学的材料看来，由于这些学校的教员，真正领会与宣传了教育新方针，在动员儿童入学上，已获得显著成绩。特整理介绍，供各地参考。
    壶关二区二十一座小学统计，在六月份时，到校儿童仅占学龄儿童的百分之二十八，经过宣传教育新方针后，七月份到校儿童即达学龄儿童的百分之六十九点五；南羊户村六月份时为百分之二十五，七月份即增到百分之八十七；黄山村六月份仅为百分之十三，七月份即增到百分之七十一。
    壶关全县五个区二百四十五座小学统计，七月份入学儿童占学龄儿童百分之九十以上的有三十三座；百分之八十以上的有六十一座；百分之七十以上的有六十五座；百分之六十以上的有四十三座；百分之五十以上的有二十二座；百分之四十以上的有十三座；百分之三十以上的有八座；百分之三十以下的则一座也没有了。
    潞城翟店实验小学，在春天时经常到校学生只有十几二十个，七月份经常到校学生即达九十来名。
    涉县八区寺子岩村共有学龄儿童八十二名，一向学生很少且不经常到校，经宣传实施方针，九月份入学儿童已达六十四名，而且能经常到校。
    沙河二区册井、高庄、贾沟、康川、南石岗、不石沟等村，也因此使入学儿童由很少增加到学龄儿童的百分之五十以上。
    平顺二区孙家岭是个极分散的小山村，一向是“有学校没学生”，也由此而得到成绩，九月份已有三十一名儿童入学，经常到校的也有二十几名。其中有些儿童须走五六里地。
    这些学校能以取得如此成绩，从材料中研究，有以下一些共同的主要步骤和方法：
    （一）教员真正领会了新方针。首先这些学校的教员，曾经县区集训，在集训中，用心的学习了方针，深刻地检讨了过去工作，从而了解到群众之所以拿自己血汗供给子女入学，主要目的是“读书识字，能写会算”，而过去由于过多的进行了生产、文娱与社会活动，忽视了学生的文化学习，使学生没有能识多少字，正好违背了群众的要求，这是儿童不入学、群众不关心学校的各种原因中的最中心的一环。因为教员们真正领会了新方针，认定了只有这个方针的贯彻实施，才能解决了“儿童不入学”的困难，并抱定决心用宣传实施方针的方法动员儿童入学。这是取得成绩的有决定意义的一步。也可说是先决条件。
    （二）反复宣传，诚恳检讨，提出保证。由于他们经过学习，思想上明确了，知道即使对群众完全有利，符合群众要求的事，也必须使群众思想搞通，才能办成。他们到村即利用各种机会，用各种方式（如村干座谈会、家长座谈会、群众会、个别访问、闲谈漫谈等）向群众反复的宣传讲解新方针，诚恳的检讨过去学校所犯毛病，并向群众提出保证今后能教会学生识字算帐。经过这样宣传检讨提出保证后，一部分群众很快接受了，自动的送孩子入了学。如潞城翟店村南街一位老汉，听了教员宣传新方针，知道以后上学能够念好书识上字以后，就送女孩上学了。并向人说：“我几辈子不识字，早就想叫孩子上学识些字，可是这几年学校光闹生产，扭秧歌，识不了字，所以一直没让孩子去上学”。教员同教育委员挨门挨户宣传方针，半天内就动员了七八个儿童入学。学生任民生的父亲说：“叫孩子们念书是个正事，只要能念上书，我还能不叫他去？”于是打发他孩子去上学了。
    沙河册井西南街教员集训回村，向村干群众传达方针后，村干群众听了非常满意，即给学校修房子买用具。农会主任贾定义、教育委员张凤仪并亲自下手帮助修房。家长们纷纷送孩子上学，并殷殷向先生嘱托要严格管教孩子们好好学习。李贵云向教员说：“先生！我叫孩子跟你上学，他要不好好学习，你可要耐心指教他。”
    壶关南羊户村教员在宣传方针时，看到群众不很相信，即向家长们提出只要儿童入了学，保证一天有一天的成绩，有些家长便愿意送孩子上学了。
    虽然还有很多人怀疑观望，但他们也已开始在注视学校是否果能办好，而扫除了漠不关心的态度。
    （三）教好已有学生，成绩送给家长看。这些教员们从宣传中看到，单靠宣传还不易取得所有群众的信任，必须接着宣传之后以实际效果来证明。于是他们采用了一面宣传，一面即将动员来的学生认真教会识字、算数，并由学生将学习成绩（如每天认下的字，写好的大楷小楷，学会的算术等）给家长看的办法，以实际来说服群众，使群众自愿送子女上学，这样收效更大。
    如壶关二区南羊户村，当经过宣传动员来一部分学生后，立即实行来一个教好一个的办法，使儿童们每天识到几个字，并由儿童每天回家向家长交待。家长高英则看孩子每天能学会一些字，便高兴得向邻人说：“俺肉旦每天回来要给我写一石板字，要象这样，我还打算叫他上高小哩”。茂林家娘看别人家孩子上学识了到字，就向人说：“如今学校和过去不同了，可得叫我茂林去上学哩。”学生任聚好的父亲看到孩子写的大楷后，喜欢得对孩子说：“你能写下这样字，以后可不能耽误你上学了。”就这样启发了家长们纷纷送子女上学，学生一天天增加，到八月份全村一百八十三个学龄儿童，入学的就达一百六十一名，经常能到校的也有一百二十多名。小羊工明根的父亲看到这种情形说：“照这样学校，孩子们能识下字，我就不叫我明根去放羊，也要叫他去上学啦”。
    潞城翟店小学生王梅花每天给她母亲背书，她母亲就向她姨母说：“叫你土枝去书房吧，现在的学校象个样子了。”
    涉县寺子岩小学总结了一小段学习，将成绩送给家长看，家长们都很关心，高立名亲自到学校给教员说：“先生，我把咱买牛交给你，叫他好好念书，家里的事我紧着受吧！”家长李双狗说：“如今学校先生不打骂，孩子们还能识下字，真是好，非叫我金锁好好念书不可。”
    壶关三区东川村群众看到孩子们能识到字，纷纷送孩子上学，全村学龄儿童四十名，入学的就达到三十七名。
