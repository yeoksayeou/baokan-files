Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, December 12th: Cultural and educational work in Shenyang is rapidly developing. Intellectuals and specialized technical personnel are receiving care and attention from the democratic government. At the beginning of Shenyang's liberation, the heads of major primary and secondary schools in the city personally took school rosters and lists to the Education Bureau of the democratic government for registration. The democratic government held forums for teachers and staff to explain the cultural and educational policies and sent personnel to assist schools in solving difficulties and actively carry out restoration work. At present, more than 50 primary and secondary schools in Shenyang have formally resumed classes, with a total enrollment of more than 30,000 students. In addition to the resumption of existing schools, the democratic government has also established several new schools in Shenyang, recruiting a large number of students to train various construction talents. Among them, the Northeast Administrative College directly under the Northeast Political Committee (with departments of administration, law, and education) recruited 1,600 new students, the Logistics Department School of the Northeast Field Army recruited 500 students, and the Northeast Military Region Electrical Engineering Specialized School recruited 300 students. The Lu Xun Academy of Arts, which reopened in Shenyang, with departments of music, drama, fine arts, and dance, also recruited 300 new students. In addition, after the liberation of Shenyang, the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Agriculture of the Northeast Political Committee registered unemployed youths and agricultural technicians and arranged for their placement, solving the learning and employment problems of some young intellectuals and technical personnel in Shenyang.

    In order to take care of the teachers and staff of various schools who were in poverty under the rule of the Kuomintang bandit gang, the Shenyang Democratic Government issued each teacher and staff member 100,000 Northeast currency as temporary living expenses. Ren En'gong, the principal of Sanjing Road National School in Shenyang, fell ill with his whole family from eating soybean cakes when the Chiang bandits occupied the city. After receiving the living expenses, he couldn't help but say with emotion: "I have been engaged in education for more than 20 years, and now I have finally seen a government that truly protects cultural and educational undertakings." Under the call of the democratic government's policy of uniting and transforming intellectuals, various specialized technical personnel in Shenyang are willing to work hard for the construction of the new Northeast. At a forum held by the Shenyang Military Control Commission last mid-month for engineers and technicians from various industries in the province, attendees unanimously expressed their willingness to dedicate themselves to the industrial construction of the new China. At the joint conference of the medical community convened by the Shenyang Health Bureau on the 23rd of last month, more than 1,000 Chinese and Western doctors, nurses, midwives, pharmacists, and veterinarians attended. After Mayor Zhu Qiwen and Bai Xiqing, Minister of Health of the Northeast Political Committee, spoke at the meeting, more than 60 people volunteered to form the first batch of medical teams in Shenyang and began to serve the people and the army. Fine art and music workers in Shenyang, at a forum held by the Northeast Pictorial, angrily denounced the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang bandit gang, which forced them to fall into dance halls and advertising agencies to live a beggar-like life. They expressed their deep gratitude to the democratic government for its concern and care for intellectuals after the liberation of Shenyang.

    The liberation of Shenyang has provided local intellectuals and citizens with the opportunity to personally approach the new democratic culture. More than 5,000 people visit the Shenyang Bookstore of the Northeast Bookstore and its reading room every day to buy and read books. Chairman Mao's works are the most popular in Shenyang. The first batch of "On Coalition Government" and "On New Democracy" shipped by the Northeast Bookstore were sold out in a few days. Other books such as "The Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party," "The Four Big Families of China," and "Public Enemy Chiang Kai-shek" also sold well. In order to make the citizens of Shenyang understand the three-year liberation war in the Northeast, as well as the industrial and agricultural construction of the Northeast Liberated Area, the Northeast Pictorial held two photography exhibitions in Shenyang, displaying more than 400 photos, with an average of more than 3,000 visitors every day.

    民主政府爱护知识分子
    沈阳开展文教工作
    中小学学生已有三万人入学
    【新华社沈阳十二日电】沈阳的文化教育工作正在迅速开展。一般知识分子和专门技术人员都受到了民主政府的爱护照顾。沈阳解放之初，市内各大中小学校负责人，即亲持学校名册、清单，赴民主政府教育局登记。民主政府一面召开教职员座谈会，阐明文化教育政策，一面派员协助各校解决困难，积极进行恢复工作。现沈阳市内已有大中小学五十余所正式复课，入学学生共达三万余人。除原有学校复课外，民主政府亦在沈阳新设若干学校，大量招考学生，培养各种建设人材。其中如东北政委会直辖的东北行政学院（设行政、司法、教育三系）招考新生一千六百名，东北野战军后勤部队学校招生五百名，东北军区电气工程专门学校招生三百名。在沈阳复校的鲁迅文艺学院设音乐、戏剧、美术、舞蹈四系，亦招考新生三百名。此外，东北政委会教育部及农业部，在沈阳解放后，曾经进行登记失学青年及农业技术人员，并分别予以安置，解决了沈市一部分青年知识分子和技术人员的学习、工作的问题。
    沈阳民主政府为照顾在国民党匪帮统治下陷于贫困绝境的各校教职员，曾经发给每个教职员东北币十万元的临时生活费。沈市三经路国民学校校长任恩公，在蒋匪盘踞时曾因吃豆饼而全家病倒。当他领到生活费后，不禁感动地说：“我干了二十多年的教育工作，到现在才看见了真正保护文化教育事业的政府。”在民主政府团结改造知识分子的政策感召下，沈阳各种专门技术人员，都愿意为建设新东北而努力。上月中旬，沈市军管会召开省各业工程师、技师的座谈会上，出席者一致表示愿意献身于新中国的工业建设。在上月二十三日沈市卫生局召开的医药界联合大会上，有千余名中西医师、护士、助产士、药剂师、兽医等出席。当朱其文市长及东北政委会卫生部部长白希清等在会上讲话后，即有六十余人自动报名组成沈市第一批医疗队，开始为人民和军队服务。沈阳市的美术、音乐工作者，则在东北画报社召开的座谈会上，愤怒地控诉国民党匪帮的反动统治，迫使他们堕入舞厅、广告社里去过着乞食一般的生活。他们对沈阳解放后民主政府关怀照顾知识分子，表示十分感激。
    沈阳的解放，使当地一般知识分子和市民们，有了亲身接近新民主主义文化的机会。东北书店沈阳门市部及阅览室，每天都有五千人以上来买书和看书。毛主席的著作，在沈阳最受欢迎。东北书店第一批运到的“论联合政府”、“新民主主义论”等在几天内即销售一空。其余如“中国革命与中国共产党”、“中国四大家族”、“人民公敌蒋介石”等书，销路亦畅。东北画报社为使沈阳市民明了东北三年解放战争的经过，以及东北解放区工业、农业建设等情形，在沈市内举行摄影展览会两处，陈列四百余幅照片，参观者每日平均达三千人以上。
