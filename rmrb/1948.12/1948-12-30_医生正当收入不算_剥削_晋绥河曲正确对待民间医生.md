Xinhua News Agency, Xingxian, 16th. Hequ County in the Jin-Sui Liberated Area, at a cooperative meeting held last month, put forward some correct ways to treat private doctors. These methods include: (1) Doctors should be regarded as mental laborers. Those who were wrongly classified in the land reform should be corrected immediately, and confiscated items should be returned or compensated. (2) Private doctors, regardless of their class background, should be given appropriate remuneration after seeing patients. This legitimate income of doctors should not be considered "exploitation." Doctors who participate in pharmacies can use their labor of seeing patients to offset shares and receive dividends. (3) Professional doctors whose families lack labor should be allowed to rent out their land. However, all doctors should adhere to the spirit of treating illnesses and saving lives, be available upon request, and must not sell fake medicines or unreasonably extort patients. In the past old society, private doctors had various bad habits, such as refusing to go out without being carried in sedan chairs or riding horses, asking for "opening package money" before even diagnosing the illness, and even extorting people when they were critically ill. These bad habits have gradually been eliminated since the establishment of the Hequ Democratic Government. However, another deviation has emerged in this land reform, that is, not recognizing doctors as mental laborers, but mistakenly believing that doctors' income from seeing patients is "exploitation." Some patients do not pay or pay very little when asking doctors to see them. Most doctors used to have profit-sharing agreements with pharmacies, that is, doctors would prescribe prescriptions specifying that the medicine be purchased at a certain pharmacy, and they would share the profits with the pharmacy. After the land reform, this system was implicitly abolished, doctors' income decreased, and their lives became difficult. At the same time, some doctors who originally participated in pharmacies and were landlords or old rich peasants had their shares and medicines confiscated. Doctors who were not landlords or old rich peasants, although they regularly "sat in the pharmacy" to see patients, were not given shares or dividends for their labor of seeing patients, but only received a small bonus when the pharmacy settled accounts. Some doctors dare not ask for money when the masses ask them to see patients; elderly doctors also dare not ride the animals that patients use to seek medical treatment, fearing that people will say they are "putting on airs." These deviations have made it impossible for many doctors to continue practicing medicine and are preparing to change careers, creating difficulties in treating illnesses in rural areas. The correct methods for treating private doctors now put forward by Hequ County are aimed at correcting these deviations, so that private doctors can practice medicine with peace of mind, give full play to their strengths, improve rural sanitation, and overcome the difficulties of farmers in seeking medical treatment.

### 医生正当收入不算“剥削”　晋绥河曲正确对待民间医生

　　医生正当收入不算“剥削”
  　晋绥河曲正确对待民间医生
    【新华社兴县十六日电】晋绥解放区河曲县，在上月举行的合作社会议中，提出了一些正确对待民间医生的办法。这些办法包括：（一）医生应看作是脑力劳动者。在土地改革中错订成份的应即改正，没收的东西应即退回或补偿。（二）民间医生不论何种成份，诊病后应一律给予适当的报酬。医生的这种正当收入不能认为“剥削”。凡是参加药铺的医生，可以把替人诊病的劳动来顶股分红。（三）专业医生如家庭缺乏劳动力，其土地应准予出租。但所有医生均应本治病救人的精神，随请随到，不得卖假药及无理向病人勒索。在过去的旧社会中，民间医生存有种种恶习，如出谬非坐轿骑马不到，还未诊病就向人要“开包礼”，甚至乘人病危进行勒索。这种恶习，在河曲民主政府成立后业已逐渐消除。但在这次土地改革中又出现了另一种偏向，即不承认医生是脑力劳动者，而错误地认为医生的诊病收入是“剥削”。有些病人请医生诊病不给报酬或报酬很少。多数医生过去均与药铺订有分红契约、即医生开方指定到某一药铺买药，他与药铺分红。土地改革后，这种制度无形中取消，医生收入减少，生活即感困难。同时，有些原来参加药铺的地主、旧富农成份的医生，其股金、药材亦被没收。而不是地主、旧富农成份的医生，虽经常在药铺“坐柜”诊病，亦不以其诊病的劳动顶股分红，只在药铺结帐时发给少数奖金。有些医生当群众请他们诊病时，则不敢要钱；老年医生亦不敢骑病家来求医出诊的牲口，怕人说“架子大”。这些偏向使许多医生无法继续行医，准备改业，造成农村治病的困难。现在河曲县所提出的正确对待民间医生的办法、就是为着纠正这些偏向，使民间医生能安心行医，发挥所长，以改进农村的卫生状况，克服农民的治病困难。
