Xinhua News Agency, Peiping-Tientsin Front, December 23rd:

The powerful Northeast People's Liberation Army, surging like a tidal wave into Shanhaikwan, has joined forces with the North China People's Liberation Army. They have swiftly encircled all the Kuomintang troops under the command of the bandit Fu Tso-yi in the three major cities of Peiping, Tientsin, and Changkiakow, the Tangku seaport, and the area between Huailai and Hsuanhua.

Fu Tso-yi, whom American imperialists regarded as their last reliance in North China, although he received a portion of American military supplies, received almost unanimous spiritual encouragement from the American bourgeoisie, and thus obtained a semi-independent position from Chiang Kai-shek, has shown complete incompetence and extreme panic in the face of this offensive by the People's Liberation Army. Fu Tso-yi and his American masters did not anticipate that the Northeast People's Liberation Army would come so quickly and in such numbers. Nor did they anticipate that the Northeast People's Liberation Army, rapidly entering Shanhaikwan, and the North China People's Liberation Army, rapidly shifting their main force to the Peiping-Changkiakow Railway, would adopt such a deadly strategic plan, causing the Kuomintang troops in Peiping, Tientsin, Tangku, Hsin-pao-an, and other places to be isolated and surrounded one after another.

Fu Tso-yi commanded a total of 48 regular divisions in this area, excluding local troops, of which 17 divisions belonged to the Fu faction and 31 divisions belonged to the Chiang faction. Among the Fu faction's divisions, one division was annihilated between Changkiakow and Hsuanhua on the 8th, two divisions were annihilated south of Huailai on the 11th, and Hsin-pao-an was captured on the 22nd, with another two divisions annihilated, totaling five divisions annihilated. Now, only seven divisions remain, including two cavalry brigades encircled in Changkiakow, one cavalry brigade fleeing west from Changpeh, and four divisions (including one cavalry division and two newly formed divisions from security forces) encircled in Peiping.

Of Chiang's 31 divisions, two divisions have already been annihilated southeast of Kangchuang. Among the remaining 29 divisions, 17 are encircled in Peiping, seven are encircled in Tientsin, and five are encircled in Tangku. That is to say, within the four completely isolated strongholds of Peiping, Tientsin, Tangku, and Changkiakow, a full 40 regular divisions are encircled, excluding the non-regular army. Changkiakow was isolated the earliest, thus attracting Fu Tso-yi to send reinforcements, resulting in him losing seven divisions on the Peiping-Changkiakow Railway. After Hsin-pao-an was captured on the 22nd, the area between Peiping and Changkiakow was completely liberated.

When a portion of the Northeast People's Liberation Army occupied Tangshan on the 12th, another portion of the Northeast People's Liberation Army had already joined the fighting on the Peiping-Changkiakow Railway and quickly cut off all land communication between Peiping and the outside world. Peiping, the largest military stronghold of the Kuomintang in North China, with 21 divisions of Chiang and Fu's bandit troops stationed there, its air communication to the outside world was limited to the small temporary airfield in the city after the Nanyuan Airport was occupied on the 17th. Fu Tso-yi attempted to recapture Nanyuan several times, but all were defeated. Tientsin and Tangku had their rail and road links cut off on the 19th and 20th. Subsequently, all the outer strongholds of Tientsin were occupied. Tangku and Taku on the opposite shore fell into a curved encirclement, with the other side of the curve being the Pohai Bay mouth, which the Kuomintang army had no time to utilize.

The fighting capacity of the majority of the Chiang or Fu troops in these four locations is not strong. Their fighting capacity has been tested in the four battles of Hsuanhua, Huailai, Kangchuang, and Hsin-pao-an on the Peiping-Changkiakow Railway, and the result has been rapid annihilation. The disastrous defeats of the Kuomintang army on the Northeast and Huaihai battlefields have taught these demoralized officers and soldiers that resisting the People's Liberation Army is meaningless.

The situation of the People's Liberation Army is completely the opposite of that of the Kuomintang army. The people in the four cities have long been looking forward to the arrival of the People's Liberation Army. The welcome and cooperation of the people, workers, and staff of government offices in Tangshan, Tungchow, Mentougou, Changhsintien, Shihchingshan, and other places for the People's Liberation Army fully demonstrates this sentiment. The people of the North China Liberated Areas are making great efforts to support the Peiping-Tientsin Front. They are especially excited about the Northeast People's Liberation Army entering Shanhaikwan to assist in the complete liberation of the North China people.

Everything fills the People's Liberation Army on the Peiping-Tientsin Front with confidence in victory. Everything proves that Fu Tso-yi, besieged in Peiping, and all the Kuomintang troops besieged in Peiping, Tientsin, Tangku, and Changkiakow, have no choice but to surrender or wait to be annihilated.

　　东北华北我军胜利会师紧紧包围平津塘沽张垣
    蒋傅匪四十个师如不投降定被歼灭
    【新华社平津前线二十三日电】象潮水一样汹涌入关的强大的东北人民解放军，已经和华北人民解放军会合在一起，迅速地于北平、天津、张家口三大城市、塘沽海港、及怀来宣化间之新保安，将傅匪作义所指挥的全部国民党军队加以包围。被美国帝国主义者当作他们在华北最后依靠的傅匪作义，虽然得到了美国军火的一部分，得到了美国资产阶级的几乎无例外的精神鼓励，并因而得到了对于蒋介石的半独立地位，但在人民解放军的这次攻势前面，却显出了完全的无能和极端的惊慌失措。傅匪和他的美国主人没有预料到东北人民解放军竟然来得这样快，这样多。他们也没有预料到迅速入关的东北人民解放军和迅速将主力转到平张路的华北人民解放军，竟采取了这样致命的战略计划，致使北平、天津、塘沽、张家口、新保安诸地的国民党军队，先后一一被孤立和包围。傅匪在这个地区除地方部队外共指挥正规军四十八个师，其中属于傅系的十七个师，属于蒋系的三十一个师。傅系各师中，八日在张家口宣化间被歼灭了一个师，十一日又在怀来以南被歼灭了两个师，廿二日新保安被攻克，又被歼灭了两个师，共计歼灭了五个师。现在只剩七个师内有两个骑兵旅被包围在张家口，一个骑兵旅由张北西逃，还有四个师（内有一个骑兵师和两个由保安部队新编成的师）被包围在北平。蒋系的卅一个师，有两个师已经在康庄东南被歼灭了，其余二十九个师中，十七个被包围在北平，七个被包围在天津，五个被包围在塘沽。这就是说，北平、天津、塘沽、张家口四个完全孤立的据点中，除非正规军外，整整包围着正规军四十个师。张家口被孤立得最早，因此吸引了傅作义去增援，结果使他在平张路上丧失了七个师。新保安在廿二日被攻克以后，在北平张家口两点之间已经完全解放。当东北人民解放军一部在十二日占领唐山时，另一部东北人民解放军已经参加了平张路上的作战，并迅速切断了北平对外的一切陆上联络。驻有蒋傅匪军廿一个师的华北国民党最大军事据点北平，在南苑机场十七日被占领以后，其对外的空中联络也就只有城内临时修起的小型机场了。傅作义曾经几次企图夺回南苑，都遭受了挫败。天津和塘沽在十九日和二十日被切断了铁路和公路的联络。随后，天津的一切外围据点都被占领。塘沽及其对岸的大沽则陷入弧形的包围中，弧形的另一面是国民党军所已经来不及利用的渤海口，这四处的蒋军或傅军的绝大部分战斗力都不强，他们的战斗力在平张路上的宣化、怀来、康庄和这次新保安四次作战中受到了考验，其结果都是很迅速的被歼灭。国民党军在东北战场和淮海战场上的惨败，教训着这些士气低下的官兵们，使他们相信抵抗解放军是毫无意义的。解放军的情形完全和国民党军相反。四个城市里的人民早就盼望着解放军的到来。唐山、通州、门头沟、长辛店、石景山等地的人民、工人和机关职员对于解放军的欢迎和合作，充分地表现了这个情绪。华北解放区的人民，正在用极大的努力来支援平津前线，他们对于东北人民解放军入关援助华北人民的完全解放，尤其感觉无限的兴奋。一切都使平津前线的解放军充满胜利的信心。一切都证明了：被围困在北平的傅作义，和被围困在北平、天津、塘沽、张家口的所有国民党军，除了缴械投降以外，就只有等待着被歼灭。
