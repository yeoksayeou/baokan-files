　　The First District of Quyang Should Rectify Wartime Service Organizations

　　The wartime service work in the first district of Quyang lacks strict organization. Out of the 42 villages in the district, only the wartime service organizations in eight villages, including Maguzhuang, were initially rectified in May of this year. The remaining villages have been in a state of chaos for a long time. As of now, the district brigade headquarters and transportation stations have not settled their accounts on time. Therefore, the distribution of service duties is very unfair, with villages around the transportation station bearing a heavy burden and distant villages bearing a light burden. Honest farmers do more work, while eloquent and mischievous people do less, or even none at all. For example, Zhang Guoyin from Dushi Village has worked 40 days in the past seven months, while Zhang Yansheng, Xiao San, and others have not worked even once. The village leadership is weak, and the district cadres do not provide enough specific help. As the logistics captain of the village said: "If we assign too much work, people won't go; if we assign too little work, people still won't go. We have no solution."

　　In addition, the problem of service for merchants and rickshaw pullers has not been reasonably resolved. There are many rickshaws in the countryside, with more than 20 in Anyang Village alone. In the past, it was stipulated that they should provide labor or pay a wartime service fee, but this has not been implemented.

　　Because the above problems have not been properly resolved, a chaotic situation of disorganization and indiscipline in wartime service work has been created. In order to ensure the task of supporting the front for the victorious advance, the rectification of the wartime service organization in this district is urgently needed. It is hoped that the county-level leaders will conscientiously implement the resolution of the division and county head meeting convened by the military region's armed forces department in September and immediately begin the investigation and rectification of this work.

　　曲阳一区应整顿战勤组织
    曲阳一区战勤工作，缺乏严密组织，全区共有四十二个村庄，其中仅马古庄等八村的战勤组织，在今年五月间经过初步整顿，其他村均长期处于混乱状态。至目前为止，区大队部、交通站没有按时结算过帐目。因此，在勤务分配上很不公平，交通站周围村庄负担重，远村负担轻。老实农民出工多，能说会道调皮的人出的少，甚至连一个也不出。如独石村张国印，七个月来出工即达四十个，而张彦生、小三等，却一次也没出过。村里领导弱，区干部具体帮助不够，以该村后勤队长说：“派出工多的，人家不去，咱没话说；派出工少的，人家也不去，咱没办法。”
    另外，商人、拉脚车的服勤问题，也未得到合理解决。农村拉脚车的很多，仅安阳村就有二十多辆，过去曾规定过出夫——战勤费，亦未实行。
    由于以上问题没有得到适当解决，因而造成战勤工作中无组织、无纪律的紊乱现象。为了保证胜利进军的支前任务，该区战勤组织的整顿工作迫不容缓，希望县级领导上，认真执行军区武装部九月召开的分区、县部长会议的决议，马上着手进行这一工作的调查与整顿。
