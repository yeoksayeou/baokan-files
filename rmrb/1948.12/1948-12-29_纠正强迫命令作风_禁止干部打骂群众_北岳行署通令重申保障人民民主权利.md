　　Correcting the Commandist Style
    Prohibiting Cadres from Beating and Cursing the Masses
    North Yue Administrative Office Issues Circular Re-emphasizing the Protection of People's Democratic Rights
    [This Newspaper's Report] In certain areas of North Yue, there exists a bad style of cadres using commandism and beating and cursing people. The administrative office of the district has specifically issued a circular to protect the people's various democratic rights. The North Yue Daily has also published an editorial advocating the establishment of a democratic style. According to a report from the North Yue Branch on the 28th of last month: After inspection at the expanded cadre meeting in August in the district, all counties had instances of beating and cursing people. In some counties, those cadres who beat and cursed the masses accounted for 10 to 20 percent of the cadres present at the meeting, with Yangyuan, Mancheng, Tianzhen, and Huaian counties being the most serious. In Xilei Village, Yangyuan Second District, the deputy leader of the brigade and another cadre sealed the door of a migrant worker who had fled to return to the team. When an old man in the house refused to come out, they used kicking, binding, and other threatening methods to force him out of the door, and considered this a "successful" method. In another village, they beat another person. In Huaian, five cadres, including a district secretary, district head, and security officer, had all beaten people. Regarding the phenomenon of commandism, in Wanping County, during production, the masses requested weeding, but the cadres forcibly coerced them to apply fertilizer, resulting in reduced crop yields. In resolving issues left over from the land reform, the cadres forcibly coerced the masses to return fruits. The North Yue Daily editorial analyzed the social roots and causes of this style, and strictly pointed out that regardless of the reasons, it could not be allowed to exist. Leaders at all levels should review their past regular education and specific assistance to subordinates, and their timely inspection of work were insufficient. Finally, regarding how to overcome this style, the editorial pointed out that cadres should be educated with Marxism-Leninism and the working methods of the mass line, various democratic systems should be earnestly established, a democratic style should be cultivated, and through the People's Congress, certain obligations that the people should fulfill should be made into covenants and implemented. However, while opposing the commandist style, attention should be paid to preventing the emergence of a tailism style among cadres, and any passive thinking of "not seeking merit but seeking no demerit" is unacceptable. In order to eliminate this style and effectively protect the people's democratic rights, the North Yue Administrative Office issued a circular on the 25th of last month with specific provisions:
    1. The people must earnestly abide by the various obligations stipulated by the democratic government; the democratic government guarantees that the people's various democratic rights will not be illegally infringed upon.
    2. No staff member may, under any pretext, insult or hang and beat the masses, prisoners, or military captives; except for criminals caught in the act, no one may illegally arrest or detain people.
    3. District offices, in the event of ordinary criminal cases, may follow the fifth item of the decision on the handling of cases by district offices promulgated by the former Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region Administrative Committee, but must handle them leniently. Furthermore, no one may illegally hold people in custody or detain them under the pretext of unclear case details.
    4. District and village offices shall mediate all civil disputes, with the people's voluntary participation as the main principle. Those who do not accept the district and village mediation may appeal on their own, and cadres shall not favor one side or obstruct them under any pretext. Governments at the special county level shall also not refuse to handle cases under the pretext of no introduction letter from the district or village.
    5. District offices shall, as far as possible, grant bail to criminal offenders, special criminal offenders, and criminals caught in the act, ensuring they are available upon summons. If detention is necessary, the detention period shall not exceed two days; if the matter cannot be resolved within two days, it shall be sent to the county for resolution. Village offices shall not arrest or detain any offenders except for criminals caught in the act.
    6. If cadres beat or curse the masses, the masses may appeal to the local government; if the local government does not handle it or handles it improperly, the masses may appeal to a higher level. If the leadership discovers that cadres beat or curse the masses, they shall be punished according to law, and no one shall be shielded or concealed.
    7. Those who illegally arrest or use commandism, resulting in loss of people's property, physical injury, or death, shall be given the appropriate punishment according to the specific circumstances.

　　纠正强迫命令作风
    禁止干部打骂群众
    北岳行署通令重申保障人民民主权利
    【本报讯】北岳某些地区存在干部强迫命令打人骂人的恶劣作风。该区行署特发出通令保障人民各种民主权利。北岳日报亦发表社论提倡树立民主作风。据北岳分社上月二十八日报导：该区八月扩干会议上经过检查，各县均有打人骂人现象，有的县打骂群众者占到会干部百分之十到廿以上，以阳原、满城、天镇、怀安等县为最严重。阳原二区大队副和另一干部在西雷庄动员一逃跑民工归队而封了该民工的门，封门时屋内一老人不愿出来，他们就用脚踢、捆绑等威胁办法把他逼出了门，并认为这是“成功”的办法，到另一村又打了一人。怀安某区区书、区长、治安员等干部五人均打过人。强迫命令的现象，如宛平县在生产中群众要求锄草，干部则硬逼着压肥，致使庄稼减收；在解决土改遗留问题中，则硬逼着群众退果实。北岳日报社论分析了此种作风的社会根源，及产生原因后严格指出，无论是什么原因所造成，都是不能允许存在的。各级领导应该检讨过去对下级的经常教育与具体帮助及随时检查工作都是不够的。最后对如何克服此种作风，社论指出应以马列主义思想及群众路线的工作方法教育干部，要认真建立各种民主制度，树立民主作风，通过人民代表大会，把某些人民应尽的义务，制成公约，贯彻执行。但反对强迫命令作风同时，应注意防止干部中尾巴主义作风之产生，任何“不求有功但求无过”的消极思想都是要不得的。北岳行署为了肃清此种作风，切实保障人民民主权利，于上月二十五日发出通令并具体规定：
    一、人民对于民主政府规定的各种义务必须切实遵行；民主政府保障人民各种民主权利不受非法之侵害。二、任何工作人员不得以任何借口辱骂和吊打群众、犯人及军事俘虏；除现行犯外，不得违法逮捕、拘押人民。三、区公所遇有普通刑事可依照前晋察冀边区行政委员会颁布关于区公所调处案件决定第五项执行，但须从轻处理。此外不得借口案情不清，违法软禁捉押人民。四、区村公所调解一切民事纠纷，以群众自愿为主，不服区村调解者得自行上诉，干部不能偏袒一方或借故阻拦。专县各级政府亦不得借口无区村介绍信不予处理。五、区公所对刑事犯、特刑犯、现行犯尽可能取保。随传随到。如有必要拘押情事，拘押期限不得超过二日；二日内如不能解决者应送县解决。村公所除现行犯外，概不能捕逮、拘押人犯。六、干部发生打骂群众现象，群众可向当地政府声诉，如当地政府不处理或处理不当，群众可越级控诉。领导上发现干部打骂群众情事须分别依法处分，不能包庇和隐瞒。七、非法逮捕和强迫命令致人民财物损失身体伤害或死亡者，应依照具体情况予以应得之处分。
