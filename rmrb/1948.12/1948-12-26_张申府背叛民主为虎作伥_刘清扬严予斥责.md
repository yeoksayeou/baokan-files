　　Xinhua News Agency, Subei, 24th: According to Hong Kong newspapers, Liu Qingyang, a member of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League, sent a letter to Shen Junru and Zhang Bojun, in which she sternly denounced Zhang Shenfu's ideological degeneration and complete violation of the people's standpoint, declaring that she completely severed relations with Zhang Shenfu both publicly and privately. The full text of the letter is as follows:
　　To Mr. Shen Hengshan and Mr. Zhang Bojun, Standing Committee Members of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League:
　　Recently, I read Zhang Shenfu's "Appeal for Peace" published in "Observation," Volume 5, Issue 9. The content and words are absurd, and the ideology is degenerate. This proves that his understanding of politics has completely violated the revolutionary principles of standing on the people's side, opposing dictatorship, and striving for genuine democracy. In particular, his slanderous and absurd remarks about the civil war describe the people's war against the reactionary regime of Chiang Kai-shek, the public enemy of the people, as "an unwise and imprudent adventure" and "rampant militarism." Just as the People's Liberation Army is reporting frequent victories and unprecedented success, and the reactionary Chiang regime is about to collapse, Zhang Shenfu has issued such an absurd and outrageous appeal. I wonder what his intentions are? Since he has betrayed the people and is willing to act as an accomplice to tyranny, I, Liu Qingyang, hereby declare to the comrades of the League Headquarters and democratic people across the country: From now on, not only will I completely sever cooperation with Zhang Shenfu in public affairs, but I will also permanently break off the marital relationship of twenty-seven years in private affairs. In the future, I will wholeheartedly support the various propositions in the three important documents that the League has published in the past year, and I will faithfully cooperate with the comrades of the League, vowing to follow the democratic people of the whole country who truly stand on the side of the people, and strive to completely destroy the reactionary dictatorial ruling group! I respectfully send this telegram to express my sincere intentions. And I extend my respects to the victory of the People's Liberation Army!

　　张申府背叛民主为虎作伥
  　刘清扬严予斥责
    【新华社苏北二十四日电】据香港报纸刊载，中国民主同盟中委刘清扬致函沈钧儒章伯钧，函中严斥张申府思想堕落，完全违背人民立场，申明于公于私完全与张申府脱离关系。该项信件全文如下：
    中国民主同盟中央常务委员沈衡山章伯钧两先生钧鉴：
    近见“观察”五卷九期所载张申府“呼吁和平”一文，其内容言词荒谬，思想堕落，实足证明他对政治的认识，已完全违背站在人民立场反对独裁及争取真正民主的革命原则，尤其对于内战的诬蔑谬论，竟以人民对人民公敌蒋介石反动政权的战争为“不仁不智的冒险”和“穷兵黩武”。正当此人民解放军捷报频传空前胜利，使反动的蒋政权即将垮台之际，张申府竟发出如此荒谬绝伦的呼吁，不知是何居心？他既如此背叛人民甘心为虎作伥，清扬故特向本盟总部诸同志及全国民主人士声明：从今后，不但在公的方面，与张申府完全脱离合作，并在私的方面，也永久断绝二十七年来夫妇关系，今后更必竭诚拥护本盟过去一年来曾经发表的三个重要文件内的各项主张，并与本盟诸同志忠实合作，誓必追随真正站在人民立场的全国民主人士之后，为彻底摧毁反动独裁的统治集团而努力！谨电奉陈，表明寸心。并致人民解放胜利的敬礼！
