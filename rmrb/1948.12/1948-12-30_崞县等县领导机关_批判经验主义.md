Xinhua News Agency, Xingxian, 28th. The leadership organs of the Communist Party and the People's Government in Guoxian, Lanxian, Fuguxian and other counties in the Jin-Sui Liberated Area recently examined their work style and found the following shortcomings: (1) The Party committee monopolizes all government work and the work of mass organizations, almost canceling the division of labor and responsibility system for each department and system. When Guoxian County recently arranged for the collection of public grain, the County Party Committee believed that the Party's District Committee Secretary knew the situation better than the District Head, so it only convened a meeting of the District Committee Secretary and did not convene the District Head to participate. (2) Superiors monopolize the work of subordinates, limiting the work responsibility and enthusiasm of lower-level cadres. When county-level and district-level cadres in Lanxian go to the countryside, they almost become village cadres. Moreover, they only pay attention to using individual activists among the lower-level cadres, and do not pay attention to uniting and leading all cadres to work together. As a result, the activists feel that the task is too heavy and the work is not stable, while the majority of cadres cannot get exercise. This not only fails to give play to the role of leading cadres, but also makes lower-level cadres feel: "We have no prestige among the masses at all." (3) Leading cadres rarely conduct correct policy propaganda and education to lower-level cadres and the masses, so many erroneous opinions spread among cadres and the masses. Some cadres in Fugu even promoted: "Hiring labor for production is not allowed after the land reform." Some even said: "Whoever owes grain, cut his seedlings." This kind of erroneous propaganda made the peasants feel suspicious and dare not boldly produce. (4) No summarization of work, no investigation and research. Some cadres in Guoxian do not have relatively accurate statistics on the number of land and the number of party members in their work areas. They work blindly, but cannot talk about experience. (5) Do not study the instructions of the superiors, and when work tasks come, they use their old experience to act. Recently, the Guoxian County Party Committee did not specifically discuss the grain collection instructions of the district committee, only paying attention to evaluating the usual output of good land and not emphasizing mobilizing the peasants to evaluate. Some district committees did not even look at the experimental typical materials issued by the county committee for grain collection. (6) Not good at holding meetings. The meeting starts with "big reports". Many attendees sit there and listen to one lengthy speech after another. Some digress and drag the time very long, making everyone exhausted. In the end, the meeting has to be hastily concluded. Not only did it fail to deeply discover problems and improve the thinking of cadres, but it also failed to solve work problems. After the meeting, everyone still acts according to the old experience. In this way, leading cadres are trapped in the quagmire of pragmatism. Although they are busy all day long, the work efficiency is very low, and new cadres cannot be produced and new work styles cannot be established. This is an empiricist working method, which is contrary to the scientific working methods pointed out in the CCP Central Committee's decision on leadership methods in 1943: the combination of leading backbone and the broad masses, the combination of general calls and specific instructions, and going from the masses to the masses. The Guoxian leadership organ decided to establish an independent working system for each department and system under the unified leadership of the Party. In the future, we must carefully study and implement the instructions of the superiors, and strictly implement the system of asking for instructions and reporting. When holding meetings, study typical materials, focus on solving several possible and necessary problems, and change the method of "big reports". Improving the political and theoretical level of leading cadres and strengthening policy study are considered by the above-mentioned county leading organs to be the central link in overcoming empiricism.

### 崞县等县领导机关　批判经验主义

　　崞县等县领导机关
  　批判经验主义
    【新华社兴县二十八日电】晋绥解放区的崞县、岚县、府谷等县共产党和人民政府的领导机关最近检查工作作风，发现以下缺点（一）党委包办一切政府工作和民众团体的工作，几乎取消了各部门各系统的分工负责制度。崞县最近布置征收公粮时，党的县委会认为党的区委书记比区长了解情况更多，因而只召集区委书记开会，而不召集区长参加。（二）上级包办下级的工作，限制了下级干部的工作责任心和积极性。岚县县级和区级干部下乡时，几乎成了一个村干部。且只注意使用下级干部中的个别积极分子，而未注意团结和领导全体干部一齐工作。于是使积极分子感到任务太重，工作不安心，而大部干部则又得不到锻炼。这样既不能发挥领导干部的作用，又使下级干部感到：“我们在群众中连半点威信也没有了。”（三）领导干部很少对下级干部及群众进行正确政策的宣传教育，因此使许多错误意见在干部和群众中流传。府谷有的干部竟宣传：“土地改革后不许雇工生产。”有的甚至说：“谁欠粮，割他的青苗。”这种错误宣传使农民产生疑虑而不敢大胆生产。（四）不总结工作，不调查研究。崞县有的干部对自己工作地区的土地数目和党员数目等都没有比较确切的统计。他们盲目地工作，但讲不出经验。（五）对上级指示不研究，工作任务一来，就搬出自己的老经验行事。最近崞县县委对地委征粮指示不加具体讨论，只注意了评好土地通常产量而未强调发动农民去评，有的区委对县委发下的征粮实验典型的材料看也不看。（六）不善于开会，一开就是首先“大汇报”，许多到会者就坐在那里听一个一个冗长的发言。有的东拉西扯，把时间拖得很长，使大家疲乏不堪，最后不得不使会议草草结束。既未能深入发现问题，提高干部的思想，也未能解决工作问题，会后各人仍然按照老经验行事。这样，领导干部陷入了事务主义泥坑，虽然整天忙碌不堪，但工作效率很低，而且使新干部无法产生，新作风无法建立。这是一种经验主义的工作方法，是与一九四三年中共中央关于领导方法决定中所指出的：领导骨干与广大群众相结合，一般号召和具体指示相结合，从群众中来到群众中去的科学的工作方法相反的。崞县领导机关决定在党的统一领导下建立各部门各系统的独立工作制度。今后要仔细研究和执行上级的指示，并严格实行请示和报告制度。开会时，研究典型材料，集中解决几个可能而必需解决的问题，改变大汇报的方法。而提高领导干部的政治理论水平和加强政策学习，则被上述各县领导机关认为是克服经验主义的中心一环。
