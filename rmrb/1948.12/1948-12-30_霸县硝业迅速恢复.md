[Hebei Central News] More than four months after the People's Liberation Army recovered Ba County, mutual aid in nitre boiling among poor citizens, under the leadership and mobilization of village cadres, has gradually developed and recovered. Ten nitre boiling groups have now been formed, and more than sixty households are able to afford food and clothing by boiling nitre. When Chiang Kai-shek's bandits occupied Ba County last August, nitre boiling households were forced to give up their livelihoods and were afraid to boil nitre. This June, the People's Liberation Army came, and village cadres, such as Zhao Yuhe, who had fled to the south of the Daqing River, returned to the village to resume work. Because the crops were not planted due to enemy disasters, and there was no hope for the autumn harvest, they had to persevere in their work in this unstable environment. Zhao Yuhe and Zhang Baolin, the director of the farmers' association, discussed boiling three large pots of the pile of nitrate soil saved from last year, producing 140 jin of nitre, which was exchanged for more than 600 jin of millet. During the rainy season, when there was no nitrate soil on the streets, they swept nitrate soil from dilapidated houses and other places, boiling and selling pot after pot. The Industry and Commerce Bureau purchased it at any time, solving their living difficulties. Under their impetus and influence, nitre boiling slowly developed throughout the city, and now eleven groups have been organized, with a total of sixty households. Recently, more than forty other households are preparing and repairing furniture, and some are beginning to sweep nitrate soil. In the past ten days, the Industry and Commerce Administration Bureau has collected 4,200 jin of nitre in the city alone. Nitre boiling households are eating and dressing much better than before, happily saying, "The People's Liberation Army came and brought us our livelihoods!" However, those who have just started boiling nitre are facing high costs for purchasing furniture because the weather is getting colder, there is less soil, and more firewood is needed. Therefore, the Promotion Agency must earnestly help solve their difficulties appropriately.

　　霸县硝业迅速恢复
    【冀中讯】解放军收复了四个多月的霸县城内，在村干的领导带动下，贫苦市民的互助熬硝，已经逐渐发展恢复起来。现在已组成了十个熬硝组，有六十多户因熬硝而有了吃穿。去年八月蒋匪侵占了霸县，熬硝户被迫丢掉了饭碗，不敢熬硝。今年六月解放军来了，过去逃到大清河南的村干部赵玉河等回村恢复工作，因为敌灾庄稼没种上，秋收没指望，还要在这不安定的环境下坚持工作。赵玉河和农会主任张宝林，便商量着把去年存下的一堆硝土，熬了三大锅，出了一百四十斤硝，换回了小米六百多斤。在雨季里街上没硝土，就到破房子等地方去扫硝土，熬一锅卖一锅。工商局随时收买，解决了他们生活上的困难。在他们的带动和影响下，全城的熬硝慢慢发展起来，到现在已经组织了十一个组，共六十户。最近又有四十多户正在准备和修理家具，有的开始扫硝土。工商管理局最近十天中，在城内就收了四千二百斤硝。熬硝户吃穿比以前好多了，欢喜的说：“解放军一来，就给咱们带了饭碗来啦！”但是刚开始熬硝的人，因今后天冷土少，用柴多，置买家具费很大本钱，因此，推进社还必须确实帮助适当解决他们的困难。
