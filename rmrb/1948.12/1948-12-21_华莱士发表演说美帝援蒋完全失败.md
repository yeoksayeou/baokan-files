　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 19th: TASS, New York - Wallace, when addressing the student assembly of Yale University Law School on the failure of the US reactionary foreign policy, declared: We have seen that our policy of supporting the reactionaries in China to prevent the Communists has completely and miserably collapsed. This policy is unworkable. All of America's material and human resources can no longer enable Chiang Kai-shek to maintain his rule. Our attempt to turn Japan into a fortress of the East will also not succeed. We have also been defeated in Germany and Western Europe, although not yet very obvious. Wallace advocated that Truman should send civil officials to the Soviet Union for negotiations and implement a broad domestic reform plan.
    Another dispatch: The Archbishop of Canterbury, Johnsen, recently gave a speech in Seattle on the west coast of the United States, also calling for understanding between the United States and the Soviet Union. Johnsen praised the Soviet Union's planned economy for eliminating the possibility of war for economic reasons. Three thousand listeners warmly welcomed his speech.

　　华莱士发表演说美帝援蒋完全失败
    【新华社陕北十九日电】塔斯社纽约讯：华莱士顷在耶鲁大学法学院学生大会上论及美国反动外交政策的失败时宣称：我们已经看到，我们在中国支持反动派去阻止共产党的政策，已完全悲惨地崩溃。这种政策是行不通的。美国的一切物力与人力都不能再使蒋介石维持统治了。我们力图将日本变为东方堡垒这件事，也是不会成功的。我们在德国与西欧也打了败仗，虽然还不十分明显。华氏主张杜鲁门应派遣文官赴苏谈判，并实行广泛的国内改革计划。
    又讯：英国坎特伯利大主教约翰生，近在美国西岸西雅图演讲时，亦呼吁美苏间取得谅解。约翰生盛赞苏联的计划经济消除了为经济原因而发动战争的可能性。三千名听众热烈欢迎他的演说。
