Jizhong Administrative Office Issues Instructions to Border Counties
    Strictly Prohibit Grain Smuggling
    [Jizhong Electric Dispatch] In order to crush the conspiracy of the Chiang bandit gang to plunder grain from our region, the Jizhong Administrative Office has specifically instructed all border counties and cities, as well as economic departments, that the grain struggle should currently be the main content of the economic struggle against the enemy.
    The leading organs of the border counties should carefully study and organize this work with the import and export bureaus and stations. It is necessary to carry out propaganda so that the spirit and specific methods of the grain struggle are grasped by the broad masses. Villages connected to both the inner and outer lines should universally establish anti-smuggling groups, jointly led by the district public offices and import and export stations, but it is necessary to distinguish between grain for the masses' own use and those who sell it to enemy-occupied areas, and prevent the phenomenon of indiscriminate seizure that separates from the masses.
    [Jizhong Electric Dispatch] A village cadre in the border area of Shengba County (newly established county) actively led the economic struggle against the enemy, reducing grain smuggling. The village is located south of the Daqing River, eighteen li away from Shengfang, which was then occupied by the Chiang bandit army (according to reports, the city was recovered by our army on November 16th). In April and May of this year, the village established a village economic organization to cooperate with the local industry and commerce office in carrying out the economic struggle against the enemy. Because the village was close to Shengfang, an average of three boats a day were smuggling grain at that time. Therefore, as soon as the economic group was established, it combined with the village militia to carry out anti-smuggling activities. They adopted a policy of transformation and education for general smugglers. For example, after stopping the smugglers and their goods, they made detailed registrations, stored the smuggled goods in the village, and temporarily released the people, persuading the smugglers to jointly sell the grain in the inland market. The smugglers originally wanted to exchange the grain for foreign cloth to wear, so the economic group educated the smugglers and persuaded them to take the money from selling the grain to buy local cloth in the inland. Because the smugglers were treated so leniently and their difficulties were actually solved, the smugglers were greatly moved. Smuggling was greatly reduced.

　　冀中行署指示边境各县
  　严禁粮食走私
    【冀中电】为粉碎蒋匪掠夺我区粮食的阴谋，冀中行政公署特指示各边缘县、市及经济部门，目前应以粮食斗争为对敌经济斗争主要内容。
    边缘县领导机关要与出入口局、所，很好研究与组织这一工作，要进行宣传，使粮食斗争的精神和具体办法，为广大群众所掌握。内外线接连的村庄要普遍成立缉私小组，由区公所及出入口所共同领导，但必须区别群众自用与到敌区贩卖者，禁止乱缉的脱离群众现象。
    【冀中电】胜霸县（新设县）边缘区某村干部，积极领导对敌经济斗争，减少粮食走私现象。该村南靠大清河，离当时为蒋匪军侵占的胜芳十八里地（按该市已于十一月十六日为我军收复）。今年四、五月间，该村即建立了村经济组织，配合当地工商所开展对敌经济斗争。因该村靠近胜芳，当时每天平均有三只船载粮食走私。因此，经济组一建立，就结合本村民兵进行缉私。他们对一般的走私者则采取改造教育方针。比如卡着走私的人货后，即进行详细登记，私货存放本村，人暂时放回去，说服走私者把粮食共同弄到内地市场出卖。走私者原为换洋布穿，经济组便教育走私人，说服其携带卖粮食的款到内地买土布。因对走私者这样宽大，并实际解决了他们的困难，使走私者大为感动。走私现象大大减少。
