　　Several Issues in On-the-Spot Supply for Troops in Combat
    Jizhong Branch

　　The last time our army entered the enemy-occupied area north of the Daqing River for combat, the local masses, under the high-pressure policy of the bandit Wang Fenggang, were afraid of being harmed by the back-and-forth fighting and dared not approach us. The puppet personnel fled, and no one in the village responded. Our army was in a tense, continuous combat situation with great mobility, causing many difficulties. However, we finally ensured the completion of the wartime supply mission. Here are some of the issues we encountered in on-the-spot supply:

    (1) The issue of organizing forces

　　Entering enemy areas, the supply issue is one of the most arduous tasks. It is necessary to ensure supply, support the victory of the campaign, and grasp the policies for the new area to facilitate its opening up. Therefore, the leadership must attach great importance to this. In terms of force organization, the local authorities must equip cadres with strong working abilities to do this work and closely integrate with the supply organs of the troops to form a unified wartime logistics organization. The forward headquarters' regimental committees attached great importance to this work, tightly grasped the control and education of supply personnel, so the relationship between the army and the local people was very good, and everyone truly took action. Although the task was heavy, the work was very pleasant, ensuring the completion of the supply task. The brigade headquarters did not pay enough attention to this issue, and the supply work was completely considered the responsibility of the local logistics. The troops were not equipped with supply cadres, and they reached out for grain and firewood in the villages. As a result, the two logistics cadres were busy all day long and could not get rest, and the work was not done well. The leadership should review and improve this phenomenon.

    (2) Several methods of on-the-spot supply

　　There are the following methods of on-the-spot supply: A. Taking from the enemy: The troops count the things they captured as a task of confiscating finances, and they hand in grain tickets for the grain they ate. We used this method a lot in the Gu'an battle. The troops did not requisition grain for five days. B. Temporary apportionment by household or by Jia (a unit of ten households). The forward headquarters lived in Huangzhuang, Xiong County, and regardless of wealth or poverty, each Jia was allocated thirty catties of corn flour. The "Baotian Department" in Miningzhuang divided the Jia into areas, and the troops' special service chief personally collected supplies, regardless of wealth or poverty. Firewood was burned at whoever's house they stayed, and firewood tickets were paid according to the system. The people reflected: "This kind of apportionment by Jia is unfair, the poor and the rich are not equally distributed, and the poor suffer too much." Especially when our cadres personally collected from house to house, the method was the worst. C. Observing from various aspects and assessing the composition. When a certain unit lived in a certain village, they divided it into two classes based on the quality of the houses, the strength of the livestock, and the size of the corn piles (the main grain north of the Daqing River is corn): The first class was 25 to 30 catties per household, and the second class was 15 to 18 catties per household. A certain unit in Yangzhuang levied grain according to livestock: 30 catties for mule and horse households, 10 to 15 catties for donkey households, and 20 catties for cattle households. When a certain unit lived in Bayangzhuang, they combined with the returning vagrant cadres to simply classify the components in advance and divide them according to their ability to bear: Poor peasants did not bear, middle peasants 10 catties, rich peasants 15 to 20 catties, and households above rich peasants 30 catties. The burden surface of this village accounted for 59 percent, and the masses were given procedures after taking it, and the grain was used to offset the labor. The masses reflected that the procedures were clear and the burden was reasonable. Regarding the acquisition of firewood, each unit is still very chaotic, and there is no proper method yet. Most of them burn where they live, or burn the nearby households. This is unreasonable, the burden surface is too small, and the residents suffer a lot.

　　In short, according to the experience of each unit in on-the-spot supply, it is best to take it from the enemy and conduct investigations in many ways to discover enemy warehouses. If this cannot be done, when taking it from the people, we must first be clear in our minds that this is a way of collecting public grain. After taking it, it can be used to offset the public grain, which is a positive agricultural tax revenue, and it cannot be regarded as a temporary grab. We must strengthen investigation and research based on the standard of land area, correctly grasp the burden policy, and overcome the simple supply point of view; but we must also prevent mechanical execution of the policy and the deviation of not guaranteeing supply.

    (3) Break through concerns, grasp the puppet organization, and complete on-the-spot supply

　　According to the different areas ruled by the bandit Wang, we obtained the following methods:

　　The first type of area is the newly enemy-occupied area, which is adjacent to our area and backed by our base area. It used to belong to us and was invaded by the bandit Wang after February this year. The masses have a deep impression of us, and their enthusiasm was high after a period of liberation. At the same time, our outgoing cadres also returned to the village to work. In this kind of area, we can organize a mixed temporary village office of outgoing cadres, puppet Baojia personnel, and the masses to be responsible for planning supplies and all wartime services. Bayangzhuang and Zhouzhuang villages in Xiong County were organized in this way.

　　The second type of area used to belong to us and deteriorated after the enemy's mopping-up in August last year. In this kind of area, the bandit Wang's ruling power is the strongest, implementing the "five-household joint responsibility" and "one person colluding with bandits, the whole family will be killed". The masses suffered heavily, and they were most worried about Chiang's bandits. They were afraid of back-and-forth fighting, afraid of standing out, and dared not approach us. The puppet personnel were afraid of being harmed by the enemy and suspected our policies, so they dared not come out to work. In this kind of place, we have the following methods in grasping the puppet organization and organizing temporary offices: (A) First investigate the puppet Baojia personnel in the village, find the main ones (if there are no main ones, find the secondary ones), explain our policies, and call on them to perform meritorious deeds to redeem themselves and break through their concerns. As for the division of labor, let them discuss it themselves, and do not force them to send tasks. (B) If the puppet Baochang and main persons in charge run away, and the masses dare not respond, we will find their family members to come forward and invite the masses, creating legitimacy for the masses to respond to us. (C) The masses and puppet cadres in the new area are more severely ruled by the bandit Wang and are most threatened by the bandit Wang. They dare not come out to work, so the organizational surface of the temporary office should be wider. And put forward to the masses: "Many people are powerful" and "the law does not punish the multitude" to break through the masses' concerns of being "destroyed."

　　The third type of area is the old ruling area of the bandit Wang, such as the area west of the Daqing River in Xincheng. The enemy's organization is sound, and the puppet office personnel do not run away after we arrive, and they fully respond (this has been the case in several battles). In this kind of area, the focus of work is not the issue of organizing offices, but the most important thing is to grasp the burden policy to make it fair and reasonable.

　　In short, in the new area, we must establish a firm mass perspective, be considerate of the difficulties of the masses, think about the masses everywhere, and proceed from the actual situation, preventing the practice of disregarding the situation, demanding too much, and deviating from the masses.

    (4) Grasp the burden policy and strive for fairness and rationality

　　The burden policy is the issue that the masses of all strata are most concerned about, especially in the new area, we should pay more attention: (A) The grain and non-staple food left by the Chiang bandit organs above the puppet Da Township should be received by the local supply cadres as fiscal revenue. The government should report to higher levels level by level, and the troops should regard it as public grain when they receive it and receive it with a ticket. The troops should temporarily record the grain consumed before the government accepts it and explain it when the local cadres accept it. The grain stored by the village Baojia below the Da Township should be regarded as village grain and cannot be regarded as confiscated grain, but it can be immediately used for supply, and a receipt should be issued to the village to offset the public grain in the future. If there is too much grain, the grain taken by the poor households can be returned. (B) The burden surface should be wider, and it should be based on the ability to bear. The big ones should contribute more, the small ones should contribute less, and the poor peasants should not contribute. Avoid the practice of apportioning by household and pouring tile jars, which violate the policy, otherwise you will be separated from the masses. Therefore, after arriving in the village, we must first conduct an investigation and organize temporary offices, and our cadres are responsible for grasping unified planning. Therefore, we must carry at least one meal's worth of grain when marching, so as not to be caught off guard when we arrive at our destination. (C) Grain and firewood should be unified in planning and expenditure as much as possible. After arriving in the village, the temporary village office should centralize the collected grain and firewood, and each unit should go to receive it, and strictly prevent the phenomenon of eating and burning where they live. Therefore, soldiers and cooks in the troops must be well educated. If the situation is tense and there is no time, you can borrow from the landlord and temporarily record it on the account, return it after receiving it, or temporarily borrow from the rich households, and then use the village's unified burden to compensate. And pay attention to repeatedly publicizing and broadcasting the burden method and distribution number to the masses, writing it on the streets, etc., and explaining that no one is allowed to change it, so that the masses understand and can supervise the office staff's trickery. (D) In wartime, the units are concentrated, and sometimes many people live in a small village. They can plan in neighboring villages to take care of the balance between villages. During the rest period, when it is close to the base area, the rear can provide unified supply. (E) In our dominant guerrilla areas, if public grain has been allocated this year, it cannot be taken on the spot (firewood is still taken). If it has been levied and transported away, when the rear dispatch is not timely, it can be temporarily borrowed from the masses, but it must be seized and returned. If public grain has been allocated and not levied, and it is stored by the Huahu, it will be supplied on the spot by the village, "eating instead of transporting, verifying and cancelling public grain." (F) At present, we do not have a simple and easy-to-implement unified burden method for on-the-spot supply. It is best to divide a certain amount of tax-free mu according to the specific situation of the village and bear it according to the grade. (G) The political organs of the troops should effectively grasp the policies of the new area and conduct discipline inspections at any time. Not only should they check whether they have eaten, but also check where the grain came from.

　　部队作战就地取给中的几个问题
    冀中分社
    上次我军进入大清河北敌占区作战，当地群众在王匪凤岗的高压政策下，怕拉锯受害，不敢与我接近，伪人员逃跑，村里没人应酬，而我军又在紧张的连续不断的作战情况下，流动性很大，困难很多；但终于保证了战时供应任务的完成。现将就地取给中所遇到的几个问题介绍如下：
    （一）力量的组织问题
    进入敌区作战供应问题是一最艰巨的工作，既必须保证供给，支援战役的胜利，还必须掌握新区政策，以利开辟地区。为此领导上必须提起高度的重视。力量的组织，地方上必须配备工作能力较强的干部做此工作，与部队的供给机关密切结合，组成统一的战时后勤组织。前哨部各团委对这一工作很重视，抓紧了对供应人员的掌握教育，因此军队与地方关系搞得很好，真正做到了大家动手。虽然任务重，但工作很愉快，保证了供应任务的完成。旅直对此问题注意不够，取给工作完全认为是地方后勤的事，部队不配备供给干部，到村伸手要粮柴，因此两个后勤干部整天忙的手脚不着地，得不到休息，工作做不好，此现象领导上应检讨改进。
    （二）就地取给中的几种方法
    就地取给中有如下几种方式：甲、取之于敌：部队靠缴获的东西算缴财政任务，吃了缴获粮向上交粮票。固安战斗中我们多用此办法，部队五天未征收粮食。乙、按门、按甲临时摊派。前哨部住在雄县黄庄，不分穷富，每甲玉米面三十斤。“保田部”在米宁庄，分甲分片由部队特务长亲自敛给养，不分穷富；柴是住在谁家烧谁家，按制度支付柴票，老百姓反映：“这样按甲不公平，穷富不均，穷人吃亏太大。”特别是我干部亲自下手挨户敛，方式最不好。丙、多方观察，评定成份。某部住在某村时，根据房子的好坏，牲口的强弱，棒子堆的大小（大清河北主要的粮食就是棒子），分成二等：头等每户二十五斤至三十斤，二等每户十五斤至十八斤。某部在杨庄按牲口征粮，骡马户三十斤，驴户十斤至十五斤，牛户二十斤。某部住在八洋庄时，与回村的流浪干部相结合，事前简单的划好成份，根据负担能力分成：贫农不负担，中农十斤，富农十五斤至二十斤，富农以上的户三十斤。该村负担面占百分之五十九，取后给群众开上手续，以粮顶差。群众反映手续清楚，负担合理。关于柴草的取给，各单位还很乱，还没有一妥善的办法，多是住在那里烧那里，或烧附近的户，这样不合理，负担面太小，住户吃亏较大。
    总之，根据各单位就地取给的经验，最好是取之于敌，多方进行调查，发掘敌人的仓库。不能做到这步，取之于民时，首先在思想上要明确这是征收公粮的一种方式，取给后顶公粮，是一种正项的农业税收，不能看成临时抓一把。必须根据地亩为标准，加强调查研究，正确掌握负担政策，克服单纯供给观点；但也要防止机械的执行政策，不保证供给的偏差。
    （三）打破顾虑，掌握伪组织，完成就地取给
    根据王匪统治地区的不同，我们获得了如下的方法：
    第一种地区是新敌占区，与我区相毗连，后面有我根据地作依托。过去属我，今春二月后为王匪侵占，群众对我印象较深，一度解放后情绪高涨。同时我外出干部也回村工作，此种地区我们可组织外出干部，伪保甲人员，群众的混合的临时村公所，负责筹划给养，和战时一切勤务。雄县八洋庄、周庄等村就是这样组织起来的。
    第二种地区，过去属我，去年八月敌扫荡后变质。此种地区王匪统治力量最强，实行“五家连坐”与“一人通匪诛杀全家”，群众灾难重重，对蒋匪顾虑最大，怕拉锯，怕出头，不敢与我接近。伪人员怕敌来被害，与怀疑我之政策，更不敢出来办公。此种地方我们在掌握伪组织与组织临时办公上，有如下几个方法：（甲）先调查村中伪保甲人员，找其主要的（没主要的找次要的），解释我之政策，号召立功赎罪，打破顾虑。至于工作上的分工由他们自行讨论，不要强拉硬派。（乙）伪保长及主要负责人跑了，群众又不敢支应，我们就找其家属出头聘请群众，造成群众对我应酬的合法。（丙）新区群众和伪干部因受王匪统治更甚，受王匪威胁最大，不敢出来办公，临时办公的组织面就要宽。并向群众提出：“人多势众”“法不责众”，以打破群众“挨毁”的顾虑。
    第三种地区是王匪的老统治区，如新城大清河西地区，敌人组织健全，我去后伪办公人不跑，完全应酬（几次战役都是如此）。此种地区工作重点不是组织办公的问题，而最重要的是掌握负担政策，使其公平合理。
    总之在新区我们要树立坚强的群众观点，体贴群众的困难，处处为群众打算，从实际情况出发，防止不视情况、要求过高、脱离群众的作法。
    （四）掌握负担政策力求公平合理
    负担政策是各阶层群众所最关心的问题，特别在新区更应注意：（甲）对伪大乡以上蒋匪机关留下的粮食、副食，由地方供应干部接收，作为财政收入。由政府逐级上报，部队领用时应视为公粮，凭票领取。政府未接受前食用之粮食，部队应暂记，等地方干部接收时，即进行交待。大乡以下村保甲所存之粮食，应视为村粮，不能以缴获粮食论，但可立即用到供应上，给村开收据，将来顶公粮。如粮食太多，可退还贫苦户所拿之粮食。（乙）负担面要宽些，应本着负担能力，大的多出，小的少出，贫农不出。切忌按门摊派与倒瓦罐等违犯政策的作法，否则就会脱离群众。因此到村后必须首先进行调查，组织临时办公的，我干部负责掌握统一筹划。为此我们行军时最少要携带一顿的粮食，以免到达目的地措手不及。（丙）粮柴尽量作到统筹统支，到村由临时村公所将征收的粮柴集中后，各单位去领取，严防住在那里吃烧那里的现象。为此，在部队中对战士伙夫必须进行很好的教育，如情况紧张来不及时，可借房东的暂记上帐，领后发还，或暂时借富户，然后用村统一负担补还。并注意将负担办法与分配数目，向群众反复宣传广播，写在街上等，并说明谁都不许改变，使群众明白了，能监督办公人的捣鬼。（丁）战时情况下，单位集中，有时一个小村住人很多，可到邻村筹划，照顾村与村平衡。在休整期间离根据地近时，可由后方统一供给。（戊）对我占优势的游击区，今年已分配公粮，即不能再就地取给（柴草仍取给）。如已征起运走，在后方调运不及时时，可向群众暂借，但必须抓紧归还。如已分配公粮，而没征起，由花户自存者，即由村就地供给，“以吃代运，核销公粮”。（己）目前就地取给中我们还没有一个简而易行的统一负担办法，最好根据村的具体情况划出一定的免税亩，按等级负担。（庚）部队政治机关切实掌握新区政策，并随时进行纪律检查，不但应检查吃上饭没有，而且要检查粮食是怎样来的。
