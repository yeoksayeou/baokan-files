Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, December 24th: U.S. imperialism is actively plotting to completely occupy Taiwan and Hainan Island as American bases for aggression in the Far East. An Associated Press dispatch reveals that the U.S. "National Security Council" has recommended to Truman that Taiwan and Hainan Island be included in America's "Far Eastern Defense Line." The main content of a recent report submitted to Washington by MacArthur also emphasizes "strengthening America's island bases in the East." American "columnist" Brown even blatantly advocated for the U.S. to supervise Taiwan and utilize Taiwan's naval and air bases. At the same time, the so-called "Taiwan independence movement," orchestrated by U.S. imperialism, is also intensifying openly. Following the so-called "Taiwan Re-liberation League," which appeared in Japan in September and openly proposed that the United Nations send troops to occupy Taiwan and establish a provisional government of Taiwan, on the 11th of this month, six "Taiwanese groups," under American instigation, issued a statement advocating that the "Allies" aid Taiwan in achieving "independence." Brown also fabricated rumors, saying, "Taiwanese are now seeking independence under United Nations trusteeship." However, even some American bourgeois elements cannot but admit that such nonsense from American aggressors is completely contrary to the facts. For example, former Roosevelt-era U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ickes, in a paper published on the 6th of this month, said that since 1946, the Taiwan branch of the United States Information Service and senior American spies in Taiwan have been fabricating various rumors in an extremely shameless manner, under the command of American "big shots and tycoons," that "Taiwanese would rather be ruled by Americans," and have widely disseminated these rumors through American newspapers in New York and Shanghai. Ickes admitted that the facts are completely contrary to the rumors fabricated by the Americans, that Taiwanese people neither wish to be subjected to Chiang Kai-shek's tyrannical rule, nor do they resolutely oppose American colonial rule.

　　美帝伪造“独立”谣言
    阴谋侵占台湾琼岛
    【新华社陕北二十四日电】美帝国主义正积极图谋完全占领台湾和海南岛，作为美国在远东的侵略基地。合众社消息透露：美国“国家安全委员会”已向杜鲁门建议把台湾和海南岛包括在美国的“远东防线”内。麦克阿瑟最近提交华盛顿的一份报告中，其主要内容亦系强调“加强美国在东方的各岛屿基地”。美国“专栏作家”布朗更露骨地主张由美国监督台湾，并利用台湾的海空基地。与此同时，美帝国主义一手策动的所谓“台湾独立运动”，亦在明目张胆地加紧进行中。继九月间在日本出现的所谓“台湾再解放联盟”公开提出由联合国派遣军队占领台湾、成立台湾临时政府的主张后，本月十一日又有六个“台湾团体”在美国授意下发表声明，主张“盟国”援助台湾“独立”。布朗又造谣说：“台湾人现正寻求在联合国托管下取得独立”。但是甚至某些美国资产阶级分子也不能不承认美国侵略者的这种鬼话与事实完全相反。例如前罗斯福时代美国内政部长伊克斯在其本月六日所发表的论文中就说：自一九四六年以来，美国新闻处台湾分处和在台湾的美国高级谍报人员即一直在美国“大头子大老财”的指挥下，以极端无耻手段捏造各种“台湾人宁愿受美国人统治”的谣言，并经过纽约和上海的美国报纸把这些谣言广泛散播。伊克斯承认：事实是与美国人捏造的谣言完全相反的，台湾人既不愿受蒋介石的暴虐统治，同时亦坚决反对美国人的殖民地统治。
