　　Xingtai City Federation of Trade Unions Organizes Workers' Welfare Undertakings
  　Establishment of Workers' Clinic
    In order to organize workers' welfare undertakings, the Xingtai City Federation of Trade Unions has initiated the organization of a workers' clinic. After extensive mobilization and preparation, it was officially established and opened on the 17th of last month. The clinic's fund is temporarily drawn from the social insurance fund by the Federation of Trade Unions, and workers' medical expenses from the Qianjin Shoe Factory and Guanghua Electric Light Company (totaling over 300 workers, each paying five jin of millet per month), totaling approximately 90,000 yuan, and Mr. Su Nairen, a Western medicine doctor in the city, has been hired as the director of the clinic. Due to the initial establishment and limited funds, the clinic's procedures and preferential measures are temporarily set as follows: 1. Regardless of whether they are employees of public or private factories, any employee who is willing to pay medical expenses of five to ten jin of millet per month can bring a letter of introduction from the factory负责人 (responsible person) and a clinic card issued by the clinic for treatment without paying medical expenses. 2. Workers from factories who have not paid medical expenses who have a letter of introduction from their factory to the clinic will have their registration fee reduced or waived. 3. Unemployed workers or immediate family members with financial difficulties who are approved by the City Federation of Trade Unions to come to the clinic for treatment may have their fees reduced or waived at the discretion of the clinic.

　　邢市职工会举办工人福利事业
  　成立职工诊疗所
    邢台市职工会为了举办工人福利事业，特发起组织职工诊疗所。经多方动员与筹备后，已于上月十七日正式成立开诊。诊疗所基金暂由职工会从社会保险金中抽出一部，并由前进鞋工厂及光华电灯公司工人医药费（共三百余工人，每月每人按五斤小米缴纳），共约资金九万余元，并聘请本市西医苏乃人先生为该所医务主任。该所因开始创立，资金有限，暂定诊疗手续及优待办法如下：一、不论公私营工厂职工，凡愿每月每人交医药费小米五斤至十斤者，可持该厂负责人介绍信及诊疗所发给之诊疗证，来所诊疗，不再收医药费。二、没缴纳医药费之各厂工人，持有该厂介绍信到所诊疗者，减免手续费。三、失业工人或直系亲属生活困难者，经市工会批准来所诊疗者，可酌情减费或免费。（前进小报）
