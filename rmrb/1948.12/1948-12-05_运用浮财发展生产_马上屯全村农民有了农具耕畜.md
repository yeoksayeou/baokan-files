Using Confiscated Wealth to Develop Production
　　Farmers in Matun Village Immediately Acquired Farm Tools and Livestock

[Reported by this newspaper] Organizing the investment of confiscated wealth into production after the land reform in Matun Village, Raoyang, Hebei Province, has already yielded good results. Matun Village is a village with 270 households. Around the time of the land reform last year (referring to the distribution of land last winter and the previous land reform review), the confiscation and requisition of land and property from ten landlords and seven rich peasants enabled 120 poor peasant households in the village to achieve an average of four mu of land per person (the village has a relatively large amount of land, and the village average is roughly the same). Basic production conditions were already in place. However, due to the lack of production tools and livestock in the past, the poor peasants increasingly felt many difficulties in farming after being allocated land. Based on these demands from the masses, this spring, the New Farmers' Association and the Poor Peasants' League, under the guidance of the land reform work team, decided to organize as much of the surplus confiscated wealth as possible to solve the problem of farm tools and livestock. The larger items of confiscated wealth in the village included more than 2,000 silver dollars and some clothing. After these items were sold, they were used to buy two head of cattle and several thousand catties of scrap iron. Two groups of blacksmiths were hired from other villages to make 50 plows, 20 seed drills, 40 trailers, 250 sickles, 150 hoes, and more than 100 iron shovels... These items were priced and distributed to those who had benefited from the confiscated wealth, solving the village's farm tool problem. Originally, the village only had 40 head of livestock. This year, through partnerships and private purchases, the number has increased to 47. Now, all 120 liberated households in the village have livestock to use (mostly five or six households, or six or seven households, jointly raising one head. Before the land reform, only two-thirds of the poor peasants participated in jointly raising livestock).

　　运用浮财发展生产
  　马上屯全村农民有了农具耕畜
    【本报讯】土改后组织浮财投资生产，在冀中饶阳马上屯村已经收到很好的效果。马上屯是一个二百七十户的村庄，去年土改前后（指去冬的平分及以前的土改复查）由于没收及征收了十户地主和七户富农的土地财产，使得全村一百廿户贫农在土地数量上达到了每人平均四亩（该村土地较多，全村平均数亦大体如此）的要求，基本的生产条件已经具备。但贫农过去由于生产工具及牲畜的缺乏，在分得土地后愈益感到在耕种中有许多困难。根据群众这些要求，今年春天新农会、贫农团在土改工作组的指导下，决定尽量把果实中的浮财部分组织起来，解决农具耕畜问题。全村浮财较大宗的计有两千多元白银及一部分衣物，这些东西经变卖后，买成了两头耕牛，几千斤废铁，从外村请了两帮铁匠，制成了五十张犁，二十盘耧，四十个拖车，二百五十张镰刀，一百五十张锄头，一百多张铁铣……，将这些东西作价分配给浮财的得主，解决了全村农具问题。原来该村耕畜只有四十头，今年经过合伙及私人购买已增至四十七头，现全村一百二十户翻身户已全部有了牲口使（多为五六户或六七户合喂一头。土改前贫农参加合喂牲口的仅三分之二）。
