The clothing factory of the Supply Department lived in our village last year and owes the masses of our village more than 590 jin of grain for making military uniforms, and the accounts have not been settled to this day. Speaking of which, our village is also at fault, that is, when we settled accounts with the clothing factory, we lost a receipt for 245 pieces of military uniforms that we had handed over, and we should review this.

The clothing factory stored a total of 19,900 military uniforms in our village. When the uniforms were taken, there were more than 600 extra pieces than were written on the receipt. (Why is the number of storage so careless? - Editor) At that time, we said to the people who came to pick up the uniforms: "Don't take the extra uniforms now. When Section Chief Sun comes, talk to him and then take them." After more than a month, the Supply Department sent Section Chief Peng to pick up the uniforms. We asked him to settle the account, and he said that he would ask Section Chief Sun to be responsible for settling it with us, but he never came. On September 9th this year, we went to a town in Handan to find Section Chief Sun. Section Chief Sun said that he had handed over the formalities to Section Chief Peng. We went to find Section Chief Peng again. Section Chief Peng said, "I don't know," and he wrote a letter and asked us to find Section Chief Sun again. At that time, our travel expenses were exhausted, so we had to go home first. We looked for them twice later, but they kept pushing back and forth, and they never settled the account. We spent tens of thousands of yuan just on travel expenses. We hope that our newspaper will publish our opinions, so that the clothing factory will know to send someone to settle the owed wages in grain.

Editor's Note: The opinions of the masses in Beixi Village were forwarded by the Xin Dazhong Newspaper Office. According to the comrades of the Xin Dazhong editorial department, in the ninth month of the lunar calendar, Beixi Village had sent a letter to them raising this issue. At that time, they forwarded the letter to the Logistics Department of the Military Region, asking the Logistics Department to handle it. But no reply has been received. This is the second letter from Beixi Village, and we hope that the Logistics Department can investigate and handle it as soon as possible.

### 被服厂欠群众工资米问题　请后勤部检查处理

　　被服厂欠群众工资米问题
  　请后勤部检查处理
    去年，供给部被服厂，住在我们村里，欠下我村群众做军衣的工资米五百九十余斤，到如今还没给算清帐。说起来我村也有错，就是和被服厂算帐时，给人家丢了一个二百四十五件的交军衣回条，这该我们检讨。
    被服厂在我村保存军衣，共一万九千九百余件，取军衣时，比条子上写的长出六百多件。（为什么存放数目这样马虎？——编者）当时，我们和取军衣的人说：你们现在不要拿走长出的军衣，等孙股长来时，和他谈一下，你们再取。又靠了一个多月，供给部差彭科长来取军衣，我们要求他把帐算清，他说叫孙股长负责给我们算，可是一直也没见来。今年九月九日，我们到邯郸某镇去找孙股长，孙股长说，他已经把手续交给彭科长啦。我们又去找彭科长，彭科长说：“不知道”，他写了个信，让我们再去找孙股长。当时我们的盘费用尽了，只好先回了家。以后又找了他们两次，也都是来回推，总不给算帐。我们光路费就花了好几万。希望咱们报上，把我们的意见登一登，好叫被服厂知道派个人来，把欠的工资米算清。
    武安六区北西井村长郭凤台、支部书记刘安海等
    编者按：北西井群众的这个意见是新大众报社转来的，据新大众编辑同志谈，阴历九月间，北西井村就曾给他们去信提出这个问题，当时他们把信转交给军区后勤部，请后勤部处理。但一直未得回信。这是北西井村的第二封信，希望后勤部能尽快检查处理。
