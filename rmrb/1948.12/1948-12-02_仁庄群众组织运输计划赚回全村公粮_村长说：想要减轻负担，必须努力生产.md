【Taihang News】The masses of Renzhuang in Licheng have organized to engage in production, planning to earn back the public grain paid by the entire village within a month. Village Branch Secretary Shen Yuqin said: "This year, I should pay 271 jin of burden grain. I plan to carry five or six loads of biscuits to Changzhi to sell, and I will be able to earn it all back within a month, and I guarantee it won't delay my work. All the village cadres plan to take turns going out to produce for a few days, and they will all earn back the public grain they should pay." Village Chief Shen Heqin said: "This year I should pay more than 300 jin of burden grain, but I have a cart, and recently I earned 500 jin of rice pulling packages for the Military University, which is more than enough to pay the burden. The five shi of grain I harvested this autumn will not be touched until next spring. Now I realize that if you want to reduce the burden, you must work hard to produce." Now, 125 out of 135 households in the village have actively started production. Those who have big carts running transport and sales have already earned 11,000 jin of rice, the saltpeter workshops have earned 4,000 jin of rice, and other sideline productions have also earned a lot. If they continue to work hard, they will be able to earn back the public grain that each family has to pay this year within a month.

　　仁庄群众组织运输计划赚回全村公粮
    村长说：想要减轻负担，必须努力生产
    【太行讯】黎城仁庄群众组织起来搞生产，计划一个月内赚回全村所交纳之公粮。村支书申玉芹说：“我今年应出二七一斤负担米，我计划到长治担上五六担饼干回来卖一下，一月内就能全部赚回来；并保证不耽误工作。全村干部计划轮流出去生产几天，都要将应交公粮赚回来。”村长申何芹说：“我今年该出负担米三百余斤，但我有一辆车，最近在军大拉包差就赚了五百斤米，出负担还用不完；我今秋打的五石谷子到明春也不用动一粒。现在我才体验到：想要减轻负担必须努力生产。”现在该村一三五户有一二五户已积极的搞起生产来，有大车跑运销的现已赚米一万一千斤，硝坊赚到米四千斤，其他副业生产也赚不少。如再继续努力干下去，一个月内即可将每家今年所交的公粮都赚回来。
