Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains, December 8th: A unit of the People's Liberation Army in the Central Plains rescued a total of more than 560 students and faculty members who were coerced by the Kuomintang bandit gang to move south and were stranded in the war zone during the Fuli Ji campaign north of Su County on November 12th, not just the 300 or so reported in our agency's telegram on November 30th. These people included more than 450 teachers and students from Shangqiu Normal School, as well as more than 100 scattered teachers and students from Shangqiu Middle School, Jixian Normal School, Xiayi Middle School, and Guanyun Elementary School. According to Wang Shoupiao, a teacher at Shangqiu Normal School: After the Kuomintang bandit gang fled from Zhengzhou and Kaifeng, they designated Shangqiu as a war zone and forced the school to move south. After they moved to Xuzhou, they were like beggars, with no food and no shelter, and no one cared about them. When the PLA's offensive was approaching Xuzhou, they still had illusions about the Kuomintang bandit gang and planned to go to Nanjing. But as soon as they squeezed onto the train, they were driven off by the officer training corps of the Kuomintang bandit army's 25th Army. Only a few students managed to grab onto the top of the train, and most of them had to walk to Fuli Ji to gather. When they were worrying about what to do there, a unit of our PLA rescued them from their desperate situation. These students and faculty members, who had been deceived and coerced by the Kuomintang bandit gang, had not had a proper meal for seven days from Xuzhou to Fuli Ji and were extremely hungry, panicked, and exhausted, especially the 60 female students and more than 20 primary school students who were even more pitiful. When they rested in the garrison of our unit, they immediately rushed to eat all the radishes in a field. Seeing this situation, the political department of our unit immediately mobilized the nearby garrison to give them their lunch. They couldn't help but shed tears of gratitude. One student said, "The Kuomintang deceived us, deceived us and then didn't care about us. The Communist Party saved us and gave us their own lunch to eat. We swear we will never be fooled by the Kuomintang again." Of the more than 560 teachers and students, with the exception of one teacher surnamed Liu who had to go south because his family had already gone to the south of the Yangtze River, all the teachers and students requested to work and study in the liberated areas. After resting for two days, our unit issued them food and travel expenses and sent people to escort them back to Shangqiu to contact the democratic government to resume school. In addition, 42 students were introduced to study at Zhongyuan University according to their wishes.

    中原我军某部救助流浪学生
    【新华社中原八日电】中原人民解放军某部于上月十二日解放宿县以北符离集战役中，一共解救了受国民党匪帮胁迫南迁，流浪战地的五百六十余名学生和教职员，而不止是上月三十日本社电讯所报导的三百余人。这些人包括商邱师范师生四百五十余人，以及商邱中学、汲县师范、夏邑中学、灌云小学等零星师生百余人在内。据商邱师范教员王守朴谈：国民党匪帮从郑、汴逃窜后，即将商邱划成为战区，迫令该校南迁。他们迁到徐州后，便和乞丐一样，没有吃的，没有住的，谁也不管。当解放军攻势日益迫近徐州时，他们还对国民党匪帮存有幻想，准备到南京去。但他们刚挤上火车，即被国民党匪军二十五军军官教导队赶了下来，只有少数学生抓到车顶上，大部分人只得步行到符离集集合。他们在那里正愁得没有办法时，我某部解放军就把他们从绝境中搭救出来了。这些受了国民党匪帮欺骗胁迫的学生、教职员，从徐州到符离集，七天没有正式吃过饭，饥饿、恐慌、疲惫已极，特别是六十名女生和二十多名小学生更为可怜。在我某部驻地休息时，他们立时把一块地里的罗卜抢吃一光。我某部政治部见此情况，即动员附近驻军把午饭让给他们吃。他们不禁感动得流下泪来。一个学生说：“国民党骗我们，骗去了又不管。共产党救我们，把自己要吃的午饭让给我们吃。我们赌咒再也不上国民党的当了。”五百六十余名师生中，除一位刘姓教员因家眷已去江南须要南下外，全体师生都要求到解放区工作和学习。他们休息两天后，我某部即发给粮食路费，并派人护送回商邱向民主政府接洽复校。其中另有四十二名学生则按照他们志愿，介绍去中原大学学习。
