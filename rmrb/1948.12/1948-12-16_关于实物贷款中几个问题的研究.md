　　Research on Several Issues in Loan of Materials
    Zhang Zhiyong
    I. Why do banks offer loans of materials?
    Since the implementation of rent reduction and interest reduction, and land reform, the system of usurious exploitation has been eliminated. However, due to its influence and the wartime situation, the borrowing relationships of the general public have also stalled. In the past two years, credit cooperatives have made preliminary progress in some areas (Taihang, Taiyue), but basically, this situation has not changed. Moreover, due to various reasons, especially the violation of the principle of "mutual assistance and mutual benefit," even the credit cooperatives that had initially taken shape have been very sluggish. In addition, although the amount of production loans from banks has increased every year, due to wartime price instability and the impact of currency depreciation, the more prices rise, the more the actual effect of the loan decreases. If the loan capital is viewed in terms of real goods, it is not increasing or maintaining its original value year by year, but decreasing year by year. Unilaterally implementing a low-interest loan policy calculated in currency has resulted in a gradual reduction of the actual power of production loans on the one hand, and restricted the development of rural financial activities on the other hand. In order to stimulate and encourage social credit activities, organize large amounts of idle funds, and give play to the effectiveness of funds, reduce waste of funds, and ensure that capital always maintains its actual effectiveness, the bank proposed the method of implementing loans of materials.
    II. Can the masses accept loans of materials?
    Comprehensive experience from recent trials of loans of materials in various regions proves that the vast majority of the peasant masses recognize that: after lending in kind and repaying in kind, neither the public nor the private sector suffers from price fluctuations. For example, the masses in Shenze County, Ninth District of Central Hebei, said: "This method is good. Farmers rely on their crops; if not, they will suffer when grain prices fall after the autumn harvest." Another example is Guan Yuxin from Potouji, Sixth District of Puyang, said: "Bank loans must really protect the principal. Last year, I borrowed 20,000 yuan and bought one stone and three dou and three sheng of wheat. Now, with interest, I can only buy three dou and four sheng and six ge of wheat. The bank loses nine dou, eight sheng and four ge. If this continues, even two banks would be wiped out."
    Of course, when starting to implement loans of materials, due to the unfamiliarity of the masses, coupled with our inadequate publicity, explanations, and specific practices, some of the masses have some concerns about lending and repaying in kind. As long as we patiently explain and improve our methods according to the requirements of the masses, the ideological concerns of the masses will be eliminated. What ideological concerns do the masses have, and how can these ideological concerns be resolved?
    First of all, a relatively common and major ideological concern is: "Fear of suffering losses from rising prices after lending in kind." The solutions to this concern are: (1) Patiently publicize and explain, so that the masses truly understand the spirit of loans of materials. For example, a comrade from Beikanwei Village, Gaoyang, explained to the masses: "In the past, if you borrowed a dou of grain from someone, didn't you have to return a dou? Now, if prices rise, the government cannot protect its principal if it doesn't repay in kind, and it will not have the strength to support everyone's production for a long time, so repaying in kind means that neither side suffers." (2) Help the masses formulate production plans and calculate production profits. Explain that after lending in kind, as long as it is used for production, they will not lose money no matter how much prices rise. Another concern is that the masses are afraid that the bank will collect everything at the due date and they will not be able to repay. The solution to this concern is to stipulate the method of borrowing in lump sums and repaying in installments, or repaying in stages.
    III. Several Specific Issues
    (1) Several different methods of loans of materials.
    1. Directly distributing means of production. According to the types of production managed by the masses, they can be converted into materials for repayment, and generally it is not lending what you repay, such as lending a waterwheel and repaying with grain, or lending a spinning wheel and repaying with cotton or cloth. The advantage of this is that it can ensure that the loan is truly used for production, prevent lending for non-intended purposes, and also facilitate the masses to directly obtain the means of production; reduce the difficulties of purchasing and transporting and the waste of labor, and the production profits of the masses are more guaranteed. The sources of the means of production are: first, promoting cooperatives to set up factories for manufacturing; second, promoting cooperatives or banks to purchase and transport from afar; third, loan ordering (such as lending ironworkers funds to order farm tools). However, the manufactured and transported means of production must be the main materials necessary for the production of the masses, are not easy to buy locally, must be of good quality and low price, and must be suitable for the usage habits of the local masses. 2. Lending grain and repaying grain. This kind of grain lending is generally not directly necessary for the production of the masses, but is used as currency. That is to say, no matter what kind of production the borrower is engaged in, grain is lent and grain is returned at maturity. The advantage of this is that the bank can control the grain, which is convenient for protecting the principal, but it is very inconvenient for the masses. After the masses borrow the grain, they still need to take it to the market for sale and then exchange it for the things necessary for production. For the bank, there are also many inconveniences, such as the storage, transportation, etc. of grain. 3. Lending currency and repaying currency. Calculated by lending currency, that is, lending currency converted into materials, and repaying currency converted back into materials at maturity. This method is more convenient than lending grain and repaying grain. The difficulty is that after the masses borrow the money, or after the bank recovers the money, if it cannot be converted into materials in time, prices will rise, and they will suffer losses, and even affect the bank's ability to protect its principal. In addition, two issues must be paid attention to during the process: (1) On the one hand, the types of materials for conversion must take into account the convenience of the masses, but on the other hand, they must also take into account whether the bank can protect its principal. It should not be that no matter what kind of production the borrower is engaged in, only one kind of material is stipulated for conversion, nor can the masses convert whatever they want, blindly satisfying the requirements of the masses. (2) The price of the conversion must be fair and reasonable, and must not deviate from the market price. The above three methods have their own advantages, but there are also difficulties and shortcomings. Various localities can flexibly use them according to specific circumstances, under the principles of meeting the needs of the masses and protecting the principal of the bank, and can also combine them well. For example, the Longyao Branch of the Southern Hebei District, before the autumn of this year, when there was no market for sesame cakes, it supported oil mills by lending, converting the loan into sesame cakes, and recovering sesame cakes at maturity. When it was the wheat planting season, and the masses urgently needed fertilizer, it lent out sesame cakes again, converting them into wheat. This combination not only supported the oil mills, but also enabled the masses to obtain fertilizer at a low price, and at the same time the bank also made money.
    (2) The term of loans of materials:
    Experience from various localities has proved that if the term of loans of materials is too short or is not appropriately stipulated, and cannot catch up with the grain harvesting season, it will affect the acceptance of the masses to lending and repaying in kind. For example, the masses in Liuzhuang Village, Shenze County, said: "A one-year term will catch up with the period between the spring and autumn harvests next year. We are afraid that we will not be able to repay." Therefore, the loan term must appropriately take into account the production season of farmers, but not all loans must be repaid during the grain harvesting season (such as spring loans repaid after the autumn harvest, and autumn loans repaid after the wheat harvest the following year), otherwise it will affect the accelerated turnover of loan funds. Different terms should be stipulated according to the specific circumstances of the loan holders, different objects, and different business natures. Generally speaking, the term of sideline production loans can be shorter, and the term of agricultural loans can be longer. At the same time, farmers do not completely rely on the grain harvested from the fields to repay loans, because farmers have sideline income in addition to the grain harvesting season. Therefore, when we provide loans, we must start with organizing the masses for production, help loan holders formulate production plans and repayment plans, determine the repayment term according to the plans, and try not to make the masses rely on the grain harvested from the fields to repay loans. This not only stimulates the development of sideline production of the masses and increases the income of farmers, but also guarantees the repayment of loans, shortens the loan term, and facilitates the accelerated turnover of funds. At the same time, in order to take care of the repayment ability of the masses, we can also stipulate the method of borrowing in lump sums and repaying in installments.
    (3) Warehouse Setting:
    In order to meet the needs of loans of materials, there must be warehouses, but the setting of warehouses can adopt different methods according to the different working conditions in various regions: 1. In areas where agricultural loans are handled by the promoting cooperatives (such as Central Hebei, Northern Hebei), it is best to be operated concurrently with the promoting cooperatives and set up in branches; where there are no branches, warehouses should be set up in appropriate central villages and key loan villages. The advantages of setting up warehouses in promoting cooperatives: on the one hand, they are responsible for storage, and on the other hand, they are responsible for operation. Through operation, they supply the masses with various means of production. Through warehouse operation, the credit department and business department of the promoting cooperatives can also be more closely integrated. 2. In areas where banks directly handle agricultural loans (such as Taihang, Taiyue, Southern Hebei, and Henan-Shandong-Hebei-Anhui), the following methods can be adopted: 1. In areas where cooperatives are sound, the district joint cooperatives or central village cooperatives can be entrusted to act as warehouses. 2. In areas where there are no cooperatives, central market exchanges (or trading cooperatives) can be entrusted to act as warehouses. 3. The bank establishes business offices and concurrently operates warehouse business. For example, the Taihang District determined: branches set up business offices. Taking the economic zone as a unit, relying on a major town, in addition to being responsible for credit work, it also concurrently manages market industry and commerce, combining the two.
    Regardless of which method is adopted to operate warehouse business, it is necessary to strengthen planning. On the one hand, it is necessary to prevent materials from being dead stored in warehouses, purely for safekeeping, forming a phenomenon of protecting the principal for the sake of protecting the principal; on the other hand, it is also necessary to prevent only pursuing profits, forgetting to serve production, and not being able to lend quickly.

    Editor's Note: The work of lending in kind is being piloted in various regions. Comrade Zhiyong's opinions are hoped to arouse research and discussion in order to better carry out this work.

　　关于实物贷款中几个问题的研究
    张智勇
    一、银行为啥要举办实物贷款？
    减租减息、土地改革以来，高利贷剥削制度被消灭了，但在此影响和战时情况下，一般群众的借贷关系也陷于停顿状态。近两年来，有些地区信用合作虽有初步发展（太行、太岳），但基本上并未转变这种形势。而且由于各种原因，特别是由于违背了“互助互利”的方针，致使已经初具规模的信用合作社，也表现得很不景气。另外银行的生产贷款数额虽每年都有增加，但由于战时物价不稳，与贷币跌价影响，物价愈涨，贷款的实际作用即愈降低，如贷款资本以实物标准来看，不是逐年增加或保持原本，而是逐年减少。片面地实行以贷币计算低利贷款政策，结果一方面逐年减少生产贷款的实际力量，另一方面也限制了农村金融活动的发展。为了刺激与鼓励社会信用活动，大量组织游资，以及发挥资金效能，减少资金浪费，而且使资本经常保持实际效用，银行乃提出实行实物贷款的办法。
    二、实物贷款群众能否接受？
    综合各地最近试办实物贷款的经验证明，绝大部分农民群众认识到：贷实折实后，物价涨落公私两不吃亏。如冀中九分区深泽县群众说：“这个办法好。庄稼人就是地里出粮食的一着；不那么着，秋后粮食一抽价，可受不了。”又如濮阳六区坡头集官玉信说：“银行贷款真得保本。去年贷款两万元，买麦子一石三斗三升，现在加上利钱，才买麦子三斗四升六，银行就赔九斗八升四。要是这样下去，银行有两个也赔光。”
    当然在开始进行实物贷款时，由于群众不习惯，加以我们的宣传解释和具体做法不够完善，致使部分群众对贷实折实存在着一些顾虑。只要耐心解释及根据群众要求改进作法之后，群众思想顾虑便随之消除。群众究竟有哪些思想顾虑及如何解决这些思想顾虑呢？
    首先一个比较普遍而且是主要的思想顾虑是：“怕贷实执行后，物价上涨吃亏”。对这一顾虑的解决办法是：（一）耐心宣传解释，使群众真正了解实物贷款精神。如高阳北看苇村某同志向群众解释说：“过去借别人一斗粮食难道不还人家一斗吗？现在来说，如物价涨上去，不折实公家保不住本，就没有力量长期扶植大家生产，所以折实计算两不吃亏。”（二）帮助群众订生产计划，给群众计算生产利润。说明贷实后，只要用到生产上，物价再涨也不会赔钱。再一个顾虑便是：群众怕到期银行一起收，还不起。对这一顾虑的解决，可规定整借零还，或分期归还的办法。
    三、几个具体问题
    （一）实物贷款的几种不同方式。
    一、直接发放生产资料。根据群众经营的生产类别，折成实物归还，而一般的不是贷啥还啥，如贷水车还粮食。贷纺车还棉花或布。这样作的好处，既能保证贷款真正用于生产，防止贷非所用，同时也便利群众直接取得生产资料；减少购运困难和劳民浪费，且群众生产利润更有保证。其生产资料的来源，一是推进社设厂制造，二是推进社或银行由远处购运，三是贷款订购（如贷给铁匠炉款订农具）。但制造和购运的生产资料，必须是群众生产所必需的主要物资，又是本地所不易买到的，且要物美价廉，并适合当地群众使用习惯。二、贷粮还粮。这种贷粮一般不是群众生产所直接必需的，而是当货币来用的。也就是说，不管贷户经营何种生产，都是贷给粮食，到期仍归还粮食，这样作的好处是：银行经营能掌握着粮食，便于保本，但对群众很不方便，群众贷到粮后，仍需拿到市场出售，再换成生产所必需的东西，就银行来讲，也有许多不方便的地方，如粮食的保管、调运等等。三、贷款还款。通过贷货币计算，即贷货币折成实物，还时仍按实物折成货币归还，这样作较贷粮还粮方便。其困难是：群众贷到款后，或银行收回款后，如不能及时变成实物，物价上涨，就要吃亏，甚至影响银行保本。另外在进行中，还必须注意两个问题：（一）、折实种类一方面要照顾到群众的方便，但另一方面还要照顾到银行能否保本，既不应不管贷户经营何种生产，只规定一种实物折算，但也不能群众要折啥就折啥，盲目满足群众要求。（二）折实的价格要公平合理，不要脱离市价。以上三种方式各有好处，但也有困难和缺点，各地可视具体情况，在群众需要和银行保本的原则下，灵活运用，同时也可以很好结合起来。如冀南区隆尧支行于今年秋前，正是油饼没有销路时，贷款扶植油房，折成油饼，到期收回油饼，正值种麦，群众急需肥料时，又贷出油饼，折成麦子。这样结合，既扶植了油房，也使群众能低价获得肥料，同时银行还赚了钱。
    （二）实物贷款的期限问题：
    各地经验证明，实物贷款期限规定太短，或规定不恰当，赶不上收粮季节，都会影响群众对贷实折实的接受，如深泽县刘庄村群众说：“一年的期，明年正赶上青黄不接。怕还不起。”因此贷款期限必须适当照顾农民的生产季节，但也不是所有贷款，都必须赶到收粮季节归还（如春贷秋收，秋贷次年麦后收），否则就会影响贷款资金的加速周转。要按放贷户的具体情况，根据不同对象，不同业务性质，规定不同的期限。一般说副业贷款期限可短些，农业贷款期限可长些。同时农民也不完全都是靠收下粮食还款的，因农民除收粮季节外，还有副业收入。因此我们在贷款时，就必须从组织群众生产着手，帮助贷户订生产计划，还款计划，根据计划确定还款期限，尽量不使群众靠地里收下的粮食还款，这样既刺激了群众副业生产发展，增加了农民收入，也保证了贷款的归还，缩短了贷款期限，便利于资金的加速周转。同时为照顾群众的偿还能力，还可规定整借零还，分期偿还的办法。
    （三）仓库设置问题：
    为适应实物贷款的需要，就必须要有仓库，但仓库的设置，可根据各地工作的不同情况，采取不同的方法设置：一、在推进社办理农贷的地区（如冀中、北岳），最好和推进社兼营，设到分社；无分社处，选择适当中心村庄及贷款重点村设置仓库。推进社设置仓库的好处：一方面负责保管，另方面负责经营，通过经营供给群众各种生产资料，通过仓库经营，推进社的信用部与业务部还可以更密切的结合起来。二、在银行直接办理农贷的地区（如太行、太岳、冀南、冀鲁豫）可采取这样几种作法：１、合作社健全的地区，可委托区联社或中心村社代办仓库。２、没合作社地区，可委托中心集市交易所（或交易合作社）代办仓库。３、银行设立营业所，兼营仓库业务。如太行区确定：支行设营业所。以经济区为单位，依托一个主要市镇，除负责信用工作外，并兼营市场工商业，把两者结合起来。
    以上无论采取哪种方法经营库仓业务，都要加强计划性，一方面要防止实物死存仓库，单纯保管，形成为保本而保本的现象；另方面也要防止只顾追逐利润，而忘记为生产服务，不能很快贷下去的毛病。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    编者按：贷实工作各地都在试办中，智勇同志这些意见，望能引起研究讨论，以便更好的开展此项工作。
