[Jinzhong Electric] The Jiexiu Labor Corps No. 4 in the Jinzhong New District, thanks to the leadership's attention to understanding the ideological characteristics of the new district laborers, timely identification of problems, and the use of a breakthrough-point approach to gain experience and drive the whole, completed its support-the-front tasks in an organized and planned manner, and maintained high morale among the laborers throughout. Their experiences are: (1) Constantly understand the situation and boost the morale of the laborers. The corps rushed to their work location on the night of October 6th. Because the laborers were all from the new district and the cadres were new, the leadership promptly delved into understanding the laborers' morale and reported it in a timely manner, which revealed many problems. For example, the level of awareness of the masses in the new district was relatively low, the laborers had a strong "corvée" mentality, there was a lack of ideological mobilization and material preparation, two-thirds lacked cotton-padded clothing, one-half lacked quilts, cadres at all levels lacked experience in leading participation in the war, and there were no activists or backbone elements. After grasping the situation, the leadership convened a general meeting to explain that the present was different from the period of Yan's rule, and enlightened the laborers to air their grievances and raise their awareness of participating in the war, so that everyone recognized that only by seizing the old scourge and capturing Yan Xishan could they live a good life. Fighting in Taiyuan was fighting for themselves. In addition, activists were cultivated in the companies, appropriate praise and criticism were given, responsibilities were clarified, and mutual assistance and friendship were promoted. After the leadership promptly commended Wang Guangfu, the companies successively saved money to improve their lives, and even bought cotton with the money they saved to make cotton trousers for the laborers. Everyone was very happy. (2) Strengthen discipline education and launch a campaign to render meritorious service. After stabilizing morale, the leadership promptly carried out current affairs education and discipline education, mobilizing everyone to call for meritorious service through activists. The first step was to set "meritorious service plans." After helping the activists set out their plans, they went to help the classes and individuals set their plans. Using the method of "breaking through one point to promote the overall situation," after two days of deliberation, the entire corps set plans and established a merit evaluation committee. Once this movement was launched, one team helped the masses harvest 30 mu of autumn crops, and promoted the entire team to start cleaning the streets, quickly cultivating 21 activists, thus improving the efficiency of completing tasks. The amount of ammunition carried by each person increased from one box to two or three boxes, and activists carried four boxes. Everyone also put forward the slogan "complete the three o'clock task at two o'clock." Regarding mass discipline: they helped local people repair a section of the road for cars; when messenger Song Erxiao bought matches, a fellow villager gave him four thousand yuan more, which he automatically returned. In total, eleven people in the whole corps were credited, and twenty-nine were noted for good deeds. (3) Based on meritorious service, the companies, detachments, and classes challenged and competed with each other. The leadership first helped one of the weakest classes, then launched a widespread challenge and competition movement. The challenge conditions they put forward were: (1) No absenteeism or going home; (2) No violations of discipline and good relations with the masses; (3) No violation of policies; (4) Task completed quickly. During the challenge and competition period, everyone ran to do tasks every time they were assigned, and successively helped the masses harvest 80 mu of autumn crops, dug three cellars, repaired a wall, solved the cotton shortage for several cotton trousers, and saved 480,000 yuan in food expenses.

    发动诉苦启发新区群众自觉性
    介休民工支前立功
    领导上成功地掌握了新区人民思想特点
    【晋中电】晋中新区介休民工四大队，由于领导上注意了解新区民工思想特点，及时发现问题，用突破一点取得经验，带动全体的办法进行领导，因而有组织有计划的完成了支前任务，并使民工情绪始终饱满。他们的经验是：（一）经常了解情况，提高民工情绪。该队十月六日晚星夜赶赴工作地点，由于民工都是新区来的，干部又是新人手，领导上根据这种情况，及时深入了解民工情绪，及时汇报，这样发现了好多问题。如新区群众觉悟程度比较低，民工中有浓厚的支差观点，缺乏思想动员与物资准备，三分之二没棉衣，二分之一没被子，各级干部领导参战经验差，没有积极分子与骨干。领导上掌握情况后，召开了大会，说明现在和阎匪统治时期不同，启发民工诉苦，提高参战自觉性，使大家认识：只有抓了老祸根，捉住阎锡山，才能过好日子。打太原就是给自己打的。另外，在连队培养积极分子，进行适当的表扬与批评，明确责任，互助友爱。领导上及时表扬了王光福后，各中队继起节约改善生活，还把节约的钱买成棉花，给民工做了棉裤，“腿暖遮百寒”，大家都很高兴。（二）加强纪律教育，开展立功运动。情绪安定后，领导上抓紧进行时事教育和纪律教育，全体动员，通过积极分子号召立功。首先是订“立功计划”，帮助积极分子订出计划后，遂分头帮助各班、各个人订立计划。采用“突破一点，推动全面”的办法，酝酿两天，全队都订了计划，并成立了评功委员会。这一运动一展开，一个队就帮助群众收秋卅亩，推动全队开始打扫街道，很快培养了廿一个积极分子，这样，提高了完成任务的效率。运弹药每人由扛一箱到两箱、三箱，积极分子扛到四箱。大家并提出“三点钟任务两点钟完成”的响亮口号。在群众纪律上：帮助当地群众修了一段汽路；通讯员宋二小买洋火老乡多给了四千元，又自动退回去。总计全队记功的有十一个，记好的有二十九个。（三）在立功基础上，中队、分队、各班又互相挑战竞赛。领导上先帮助一个最薄弱的班，遂即掀起普遍的挑战竞赛运动。他们提出的挑战条件是：（一）全班不开小差不回家；（二）不犯纪律搞好群众关系；（三）不违犯政策；（四）任务完成快。在挑战竞赛期间，每次分配任务，大家都是跑着干，并先后帮助群众收秋八十亩，打了三个地窑，修了一道墙，解决了几条棉裤的棉花困难，并节约了菜金四十八万元。
