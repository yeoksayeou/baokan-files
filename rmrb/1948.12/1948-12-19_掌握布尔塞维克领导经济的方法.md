　　Mastering the Bolshevik Method of Leading the Economy
　　Gusalov, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party (Bolshevik) of Belarus
　　The Belarusian Socialist Federal Republic has greatly increased the speed of restoring and developing industry and agriculture.
　　The Republic's industry completed 102% of the total output of industrial products in 1947. Many new large enterprises have also been put into operation. Cities restored and constructed 232,000 square meters of residential area in one year.
　　In order to implement the historic resolution of the February Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), the collective farm members and individual farmers of the Republic expanded the spring sowing of grain by 18.2% and the sowing of winter grain (to be harvested this year) by 22.1% in 1947. Tractor stations exceeded the plan for tractor work. The Republic completed the state grain requisition plan ahead of schedule, delivering more than 1.5 million poods of grain to the state above the plan. It also completed the potato requisition plan and the production of animal fat ahead of schedule. In the countryside, 68,948 houses were built in one year, accounting for nearly 110% of the planned target.
　　The Republic's party organization led the socialist competition of the broad masses to strive for the early completion of the post-war Five-Year Plan. Some improvements have been achieved in the party's organizational and political work. The enthusiasm of party members has grown. Party organs have improved their leadership in the Marxist-Leninist education of party members and cadre work. The majority of party members are even spontaneously studying Marxist-Leninist theory in schools, study groups, and party education systems. A two-year Republic Party School, eleven Marxist-Leninist night schools, two hundred and eleven district night party schools, two thousand and five hundred political schools, and others have been established and opened. The level of mass political work among residents has been greatly improved.
　　However, we still have serious flaws and shortcomings. Life has put forward new and great tasks, requiring further improvement of the party's political and organizational work, and requiring in-depth study of methods of leading industry and agriculture.
　　Many party organizations in Belarus have not thoroughly transformed their work to meet the requirements of the objective situation. In our practical work, there is often the fact that some functions of economic organizations and economic organs that do not belong to them are taken over. This inevitably leads to the substitution of state and economic organs, and turns party organs into administrative organs that handle economic work issues in an all-encompassing manner. We have done too little and not well enough in educating party organizations on how to correctly combine party political work with economic work.
　　We should take Comrade Stalin's instructions on not separating politics and economics in practical work as a constant guiding principle, because politics and economics often coexist and operate together in life. Comrade Stalin said: "Whoever wants to separate politics from economics in our practical work, wants to strengthen political work at the expense of reducing economic work, or conversely, strengthen economic work at the expense of reducing political work, will inevitably run into snags." Bolshevism rejects the phenomenon of evading economic work, evading economic tasks, and forgetting the party's political work; communists have no connection with narrow-minded pragmatists.
　　There are many parallelisms in the work of the Party and the Soviets, and they often confuse their responsibilities. The Central Committee of the Communist Party (Bolshevik) of Belarus and the Council of Ministers of the Republic have issued too many joint resolutions, which are often not actually necessary. Some of these resolutions directly push local party organs to take over the work of Soviet economic organs.
　　We mainly issued a large number of resolutions, instructions, and directives on economic issues to local party organs. Bureaucracy and formalism have not been eradicated among the departments of the Central Committee of the Communist Party (Bolshevik) of Belarus and its leaders.
　　These shortcomings were recently exposed with Bolshevik frankness and irreconcilability at the plenary session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party (Bolshevik) of Belarus. The participants of the plenary session correctly criticized that the Central Committee of the Communist Party (Bolshevik) of Belarus had not made the issues of party organization and party political work the center of its work.
　　Our main task now is to consolidate local party organizations, improve leadership over them, enable them to exercise party supervision over the activities of local state and economic organs, criticize and eliminate shortcomings in their own work, and perform their political and organizational role among the masses.
　　The shortcomings found in the work of the Central Committee of the Communist Party (Bolshevik) and the Council of Ministers of the Republic are not few but belong to the Party Committees and Executive Committees of the Provincial and District Soviets of Labor Representatives in a large range. It is very regrettable that here, some provincial Party committees, when carrying out an economic and political movement, do not fully utilize the vast group of party and non-party activists to participate in these movements, nor do they rely on party grassroots organizations.
　　Some provincial Party committees often take over the work of the provincial executive committees (referring to the organs of state power - editor) when solving some economic problems. For example, the Polotsk and Grodno provincial Party committees actually cancelled the provincial executive committees' leadership over economic work, they neglected the party's political work, and turned themselves into administrative organs. This has brought huge losses to our cause. Party organs take over some daily trivial economic work, but they themselves do not have the necessary institutions and specialized personnel to carry out this work, do not have sufficient knowledge to carry out the work, while the provincial executive committees with large institutions and departments work lifelessly.
　　Take the requisition of timber as an example. Our Republic is lagging behind in completing this extremely important task of the state. The reason for this is that some party organizations have not led the timber requisition work well. The provincial Party committee shoulders some of the work related to timber requisition: such as organizing labor, material and technical security, assigning the tasks of concentration and operation, caring for transportation, and solving all the daily trivial matters that should be done by the Soviet and economic organs. As for what the provincial Party committee and district Party committee should do, such as implementing the political leadership of this extremely important movement, organizing supervision of the activities of economic personnel, and reviewing the work of Party organizations, they have put it out of their minds.
　　From the above, it can be concluded that our top priority now is to ultimately eradicate this harmful practice of taking over Soviet and economic organs, and focus our attention on the main issues of developing the economy and carrying out party political work.
　　Comrade Stalin taught us that the Bolshevik method of leading economic organs lies in "systematically consolidating these organs, not going beyond them, but leading production through them." If the Soviet or economic organs cannot shoulder the tasks submitted to them, they should not be taken over, nor should their responsibilities be relieved, and interfere randomly, but should be consolidated and send cadres to help them. The party organization can also improve the role of the local Soviet—as an organ of state power—as an economic organizer and cultural educator.
　　Recently, the Central Committee of the Communist Party (Bolshevik) of Belarus implemented some measures to consolidate the district Party committees, but these measures are still insufficient. We rarely educate district Party committees in the Bolshevik leadership style. Many district committees do not rely on party grassroots organizations and Communist Youth League organizations; they do not rely on the vast number of collective farm and Soviet activists. Such district committees are very unfamiliar with the life of collective farms. This deep-rooted and incorrect leadership mechanism through the so-called "representative route" isolates the district Party committee from the party grassroots organizations. The leaders of these district Party committees always replace organizational work with administrative management, they act in the manner of economic workers, not in the manner of political workers.
　　The Slutsky District of the Bobruisk Province can be called a not-bad district. Even here, the shortcomings of party leadership are clearly manifested. The district Party committee mainly solves the current movement-related issues, solving them very superficially. The district Party committee gets caught up in the affairs of these movements, but does not deal with real party political issues, its leaders do not see what will happen in the future, do not seriously study the economy of the collective farms, and have no interest in the cultural life issues of the residents of the district. In the work of the district Party committee, there is no clarity, no planning, and the powers of the district executive committee are confused.
　　Not long ago, the district executive committee discussed the implementation methods for preventing fires in the district. A few days later, the same issue was brought up to the district committee for discussion. On February 27, the district committee listened to the report of the manager of the tractor station, Baumauski, on signing contracts with collective farms and repairing tractors. The next day, the same issue was brought up to the meeting of the district Soviet executive committee for discussion. Such situations also often occur among township Soviet chairmen: today they report at the district committee meeting, and tomorrow they report at the executive committee meeting, and they are still talking about the same issue. The shortcomings of the Slutsky district Party committee generally symbolize the situation in many other districts. Many district Party committees neglect the task of ideological and political education of party members, neglect the task of consolidating party organizations and expanding mass political work among the working people by all means. These district Party committees merge the entire leadership of party grassroots organizations into the leadership of daily economic movements.
　　Not long ago, we convened the summary election delegate meetings of district and city parties. These meetings revealed many shortcomings in the work of the Party committees. The delegates pointed out the necessity of improving the party's political work by treating the root cause. They criticized the incorrect system of sometimes unnecessarily sending delegates to the lower levels. The delegates pointed out that there are harmful bureaucratic and formalistic working methods in the leadership of party organizations.
　　We must resolutely eliminate all these shortcomings. Party organizations should be political organizers and educators who cultivate the communist spirit and Soviet patriotism of the working masses. The issue is to turn the attention of the leaders of party organs to working among the masses. We want to achieve this by strengthening all party work and raising the ideological life level of party organizations.
　　In front of the working people of Belarus, in 1948—the decisive year of the post-war Stalin Five-Year Plan, there are very important tasks.
　　Compared with last year, our industry should expand production by 49%. Nearly one million rubles of capital will be invested this year, which is indeed much more than the amount invested in 1947. We should achieve not only to make industrial enterprises produce without loss, but also should produce new profits, discover new production resources day by day, transform the technology and mechanization in the production process, find new ways to improve labor organization and sharply increase labor productivity, so as to improve the quality of products day by day. Implementing the strictest economic system should become the working law of each enterprise to ensure that the cost of products is reduced regularly and systematically. We should strengthen our attention to the full satisfaction of the material and cultural requirements of the residents, and care more about the needs of the people and the material and daily life equipment of the working people.
　　In 1948, we should more resolutely further implement the historic resolution of the February Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party—Stalin's plan for post-war restoration and development of agricultural economy. This spring, we will expand the sown area in collective farms by 18.3%. This year, Belarus' grain sowing has already reached the level planned for the final year of the post-war Five-Year Plan. We are also planning to expand the sown area of potatoes, flax, and rubber trees. Our main task in agriculture is to fight for the increase of grain and technical crops by all means, to fight for the reproduction of social public animal husbandry, and to fight for the consolidation of collective farm organizations and economy.
　　In order to gloriously shoulder these tasks, party organizations should fully grasp the Bolshevik leadership style that requires combining party political work and economic work. The leadership methods of party organs should at all times give play to the initiative and enthusiasm of party members and the broad masses of working people, improve their socialist consciousness, so that they can improve the sense of responsibility of our cadres for eliminating shortcomings in their work, so as to ensure the speed of accelerating the pace towards communism in the future.

　　掌握布尔塞维克领导经济的方法
    白俄罗斯共产党（布）中央书记  古萨洛夫
    白俄罗斯社会主义联邦共和国大大的提高了恢复和发展工业与农业的速度。
    共和国的工业完成了一九四七年工业品总产量的百分之一百零二。许多新的大企业亦业已开工。各城市在一年中恢复和建筑了二十三万二千平方米面积的住宅。
    为了执行联共（布）党中央委员会二月全会具有历史意义的决议，共和国的集体农庄庄员及农民田庄在一九四七年扩大了春季播种谷物百分之十八点二，和冬季谷物播种（将于今年收割者）百分之二十二点一。拖拉机供给站超过了拖拉机工作的计划。共和国提前完成了国家的征粮计划，给国家超出计划多交了一百五十万普特以上的谷物。同样提前完成了土豆的征收计划和动物油的出产量。在乡村里在一年中建筑起了六万八千九百四—八所住宅，占预定计划的将近百分之一百一十。
    共和国党的组织领导了广大群众为提前完成战后五年计划而斗争的社会主义竞赛。达到了党的组织工作及政治工作的某些改善。共产党员的积极性增长起来了。党的机关改善了其对共产党员的马列主义教育及干部工作的领导。在学校中、讲习小组中、党的教育系统中，甚至有大部分共产党员也自动的研究马列主义理论。设立并开办了一个二年制的共和国党校，十一个马列主义夜校，二百一十一个区的夜习党校，二千五百个政治学校和其他的等等。居民中群众政治工作的水准大大地提高了。
    但是，我们还是有着严重的破绽和缺点的。生活给我们提出了新的巨大的任务，要求进一步改善党的政治工作和组织工作，要求钻研领导工业和农业的方法。
    白俄罗斯许多党的组织还没有适当客观形势的要求彻底地改造自己的工作。在我们实际工作中经常有这样的事实，就是把一些不属于自身的经济组织和经济机关的职权包揽在自己身上。这样就势必包办代替国家的和经济的机关，并把党的机关变成无所不管的处理经济工作问题的行政管理机关。教育党的组织怎样正确的结合党的政治工作和经济工作我们还作的很少而且作的不好。
    我们应该以斯大林同志关于在工作中在实际情况中不能把政治和经济分开的指示作为经常的指导原则，因为在生活中政治和经济经常是共同存在并一块活动的。斯大林同志说：“谁要想在我们实际工作中把政治同经济分开，想以减少经济工作的代价来加强政治工作，或者相反以减少政治工作的代价来加强经济工作，谁就势必要碰钉子。”布尔塞维克主义是唾弃那种回避经济工作、回避经济任务和忘却党的政治工作的现象的；共产党员是和狭隘的事务主义者没有因缘的。
    在党的和苏维埃的工作中有许多平行主义者，他们经常混淆自己的职责。白俄罗斯共产党（布）中央委员会和共和国部长会议过多的发布了共同的决议，这些决议经常是实际上并没有必要的。其中有些决议直接推动地方党的机关去包办代替苏维埃的经济机关的工作。
    我们给地方党的机关主要的是在经济问题上发出了数量繁多的决议、训令和指示。文牍主义和官僚主义的成份在白俄罗斯共产党（布）中央委员会的部门中及其领导工作者中间还没有根绝。
    这些缺点在不久前召开的白俄罗斯共产党（布）中央委员会的全会上曾被以布尔塞维克的直言不讳的精神及不可调和性加以揭露。全会的参加者正确的批评了白俄罗斯共产党（布）中央委员会还没有把党的组织及党的政治工作问题作为自己工作的中心。
    我们现在主要的任务在于巩固地方党的组织，改善对他们的领导，使他们能够对当地国家机关及经济机关的活动实行党的监督，批评并铲除在自己工作中的缺点，执行自己在群众中的政治及组织作用。
    在共产党（布）中央委员会及白俄罗斯共和国部长会议工作中发现的缺点，并非少数而是在很大范围内属于一些省的区的党委会及劳动代表的省、区苏维埃执行委员会的。非常遗憾的，在我们这里，有一些党的省委会在进行一个经济及政治运动时，完全不利用党的及非党的积极分子的广大集团去参加这些运动，也不依靠党的基层组织。
    一些省党委经常在解决一些经济问题时包办代替省执行委员会（指政权机关——编者）的工作。譬如：波劳茨基及格劳德涅斯基的省党委实际上是取消了省执行委员会对经济工作的领导，他们忽视了党的政治工作，而把自己变成一个行政管理机关了。这一点对我们的事业带来了浩大的损失。党的机关把一些日常琐碎的经济工作包揽在自己身上，而本身却没有为进行此一工作所必须的机构和专门人材，没有进行该行工作的足够知识，而同时，拥有庞大机构及部门的省执行委员会却工作得毫无生气。
    就拿征收木材作例子吧。我们共和国在完成国家这一极其重要的任务时是落后了。其所以如此，是因为一些党的组织没有很好的领导木材征收工作。省党委把一些征收木材有关的工作：如组织劳动力，物质技术保障，集中及运转的任务分配，对运输工具的关心，及所有应该由苏维埃的及经济的机关作的日常琐碎事物的解决，都独揽在自己的肩上。如象实现对这一极其重要的运动的政治领导，对经济人员活动的组织监督，对党组织的工作审查等应该是省党委及区党委执行的工作，他们却把它置诸脑后了。
    从以上所述，可以得出结论：现在我们的头等任务在于最终地根绝这种包办代替苏维埃的及经济机关的有害的作法，并集中注意力于发展经济的主要问题，和开展党的政治工作。
    斯大林同志教训我们说：布尔塞维克式的领导经济机关的方法在于“有系统地巩固这些机关，并不是超越其上，而是经过它们去领导生产”。假如苏维埃的或者经济的机关担当不起提交给他们的任务时，倒应该不是去包办代替它，也不是去解除他们的职责，乱插一脚，而是巩固它，派干部去帮助它。党的组织也可以此提高地方苏维埃——作为一个国家政权机关——的经济组织者的及文化教育者的作用。
    最近以来，白俄罗斯共产党（布）中央委员会实现了一些巩固区党委的措施，但这些措施，尚还感不足。我们很少教育区党委以布尔塞维克的领导作风。很多的区委没有依靠党的基层组织和少共团组织；没有依靠广大的集体农庄的和苏维埃的积极分子。这样的区委对集体农庄的生活很不熟悉。经过所谓“代表路线”的这种根深蒂固的不正确的领导机构使区党委和党的基层组织隔绝了。这些区党委的领导者，时时刻刻以行政管理来代替组织工作，他们是以经济工作人员的方法办事，而不是以政治工作者的作法办事。
    鲍普鲁斯基省的斯鲁茨基区可称为不坏的一个区。就在这里也很明显的表现出了党领导的缺点。区党委主要的解决目前带运动性的问题时，解决得很浮皮表面。区党委陷入了这些运动的事务中而却不去处理真正的党的政治问题，他的领导者看不到未来将要发生的事情，不认真研究集体农庄的经济，对本区居民的文化生活问题毫无兴趣。在区党委的工作中，没有明确性，没有计划性，和区执行委员会的职权混淆不清。
    不久前区执行委员会讨论了在该区预防火灾的实行办法。过了几天后，同一个问题又提到区委会来讨论。二月二十七日，区委会听取了拖拉机供给站经理巴乌马斯基关于同集体农庄签订合同及修理拖拉机的报告。次日，同一问题又提到区苏维埃执行委员会的会议上去讨论。此类情形也经常发生在乡苏维埃主席中间：今天在区委会上作了报告，明天又到执行委员会的会议上报告，而讲来讲去还是讲的那一个问题。斯鲁茨基区党委的缺点也一般的象征着其他很多地区的情形。许多的区党委忽略了共产党员的思想政治教育的任务，忽视了巩固党的组织及用一切方法扩大劳动人民中群众政治工作的任务。这些区党委把全部领导党的基层组织归并到领导日常经济运动中去了。
    不久前在我们这里召集了区、市党的总结选举代表会议。这些会议揭露了很多党委会工作中的缺点。代表们指出了应以治本的方法来改善党的政治工作之必需。他们批评了那种有时是不必要的乱派代表到下边去的不正确的作风制度。代表们指出了在党组织的领导中存在着有害的文牍主义及官僚主义的工作方法。
    我们应该坚决的消灭所有这些缺点。党的组织应该是培养劳动群众共产主义精神及苏维埃爱国主义精神的政治的组织者和教育者。问题是在于要使党的机关领导者的注意力转向在群众中去作工作。我们要以加强所有党的工作的办法达到此点，并提高党组织的思想生活水准。
    在白俄维斯劳动人民面前，在一九四八年——战后斯大林五年计划有决定意义的一年，摆着很重大的任务。
    我们的工业同去年比较，应该扩大生产百分之四十九。本年度将要投入将近一百万卢布的资本，事实上大大的超过一九四七年所投入的数目。应该达到不仅仅要使工业企业生产不要亏本，而且应该生产出新的利润，一天天的发掘新的生产资源，改造生产过程中的技术和机械化，找到新的改善劳动组织和锐猛的提高劳动生产力的道路，以便日复一日的提高产品的质量。实现最严格的经济制度应该成为保障经常有系统地减低产品成本的各企业的工作法律。应该加强注意于居民物质、文化要求的充分的满足，更多的关心人民的需要和劳动人民的物质的和日常生活方面的设备。
    我们在一九四八年，应该更坚决的为更进一步实现联共党中央二月全会的具有历史意义的决议——斯大林的战后恢复和发展农业经济的计划。今年春天将要在集体农庄中扩大播种面积达百分之十八点三。白俄罗斯今年谷物播种已经可以达到战后五年计划最终一年所预定的水准了。同样的计划着扩大土豆、亚麻、和胶树的播种面积。我们在农业中主要的任务就是用一切方法为谷物及技术作物的提高而斗争，为社会公有畜牧的繁殖而斗争，为集体农庄组织的及经济的巩固而斗争。
    为了光荣的担负起这些任务，党的组织应该完全掌握要求结合党的政治工作和经济工作的布尔塞维克的领导作风。党机关的领导方法应该每时每刻发挥共产党员及广大劳动群众的自动性与积极性，提高他们的社会主义的自觉性，以便他们能够提高我们干部对铲除工作中缺点的责任感，以便保障加速今后走向共产主义道路的速度。
