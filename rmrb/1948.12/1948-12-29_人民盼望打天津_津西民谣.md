　　The people long for the attack on Tianjin
  　Tianjin Western Folk Song
    West of Tianjin,
    So much suffering,
    The Kuomintang bandits have brought disaster for years,
    Conscripting men, demanding youth,
    Demanding grain and money without end.

    Fake big township,
    Reserve team,
    Making it impossible for the people to survive;
    Eating sesame flatbread, stir-fried eggs,
    Wouldn't do without sesame oil.

    Kuomintang soldiers came,
    Occupied the village,
    Villagers followed them around;
    Making good tea, offering foreign cigarettes,
    A slap in the face if serving was slow.

    Kuomintang bandits,
    Truly hateful,
    Finding things and pretending to be the Eighth Route Army,
    Taking quilts, tearing down door curtains,
    Searching every inch under the kang.

    The common people,
    Suffering unspeakable,
    No food to eat, no clothes to wear;
    Chiang and Fu bandits,乱搞 (messing around),
    Using grain to exchange for young women.

    Kuomintang bandits are fat,
    The people are thin,
    Who will come to rescue the people?
    The People's Liberation Army, come quickly,
    Chiang Kai-shek is about to fall!

    Sleeping at night with light coming from all sides,
    No bedding, no covers, no clothes;
    The old people are shivering,
    The children are crying for their mothers.
    Good children,
    Sleep quickly,
    The People's Liberation Army is about to attack Tianjin,
    Reclaim clothes,
    Take back quilts,
    No more suffering from now on.

    Looking forward to the stars,
    Looking forward to the moon,
    Hoping for the People's Liberation Army to come quickly;
    Looking forward to the moon,
    Looking forward to the stars,
    Hoping for the People's Liberation Army to attack Tianjin.

### 人民盼望打天津　津西民谣

　　人民盼望打天津
  　津西民谣
    天津西，
    多苦难，
    蒋匪祸害好几年，
    抓壮丁、要青年，
    要粮要款没个完。
　
    伪大乡，
    后备队，
    闹的百姓没法混；
    吃烙饼、炒鸡蛋，
    香油少了他不干。
　
    蒋军来，
    把村占，
    老乡围着屁股转；
    泡好茶、递洋烟，
    照应慢了彩掌扇。
　
    蒋匪兵，
    真可恶，
    找东西冒充是八路，
    拿被子、摘门帘，
    炕底上摸个遍。
　
    老百姓，
    苦难言，
    吃没吃来穿没穿；
    蒋傅匪、瞎胡干，
    拿着粮食把小婆换。
　
    蒋匪肥，
    百姓瘦，
    谁把百姓来搭救；
    解放军，快来喽，
    介石快要拆台喽。
　
    晚上睡觉四面光，
    没铺没盖没衣裳；
    老人冻的磕打牙，
    孩子冻的叫妈妈。
    好娃娃，
    快快睡，
    解放军快打天津卫，
    夺回衣，
    拿回被，
    以后不再活受罪。
　
    盼星星，
    盼月亮，
    盼着解放军来的快当；
    盼月亮，
    盼星星，
    盼解放军打天津。
