【Shijiazhuang News】Since the Flourishing Factory made its Party General Branch Committee public, a surge of enthusiasm for joining the Party has swept through the workers. As of the 1st of this month, over one hundred and twenty people have filled out applications requesting to join the Party: including ordinary workers, technical workers, general staff, and higher-level staff. Technician Xie Yong, in his article "Finding the Light," said: "I have been in the liberated area for almost ten full months. Here, I have seen the Communist Party's various deeds of serving the people wholeheartedly, and I have found the light I was seeking. I hope to become a member of the Communist Party, to receive deeper education, consolidate my foundation for serving the people, and to undertake the tasks of the vanguard of the proletariat." Old worker Yang Dongshan said in his article "Wholeheartedly Seeking the Communist Party": "When the Japanese occupied Yuci, I was working in the Yuci yarn factory and often worked for the Eighth Route Army's People's Self-Defense Forces and Armed Work Teams: helping them purchase things, deliver letters, and pass on intelligence. After Yan Xishan occupied Yuci, the union he sent, under Ren Xutang, interrogated me twice, punishing me for more than a month, telling me to admit to communicating with the Eighth Route Army. I did not admit it, and finally ran away on the 29th day of the fourth month of the lunar calendar this year, wholeheartedly wanting to find the Communist Party and wanting to do revolutionary work again. Today I finally found it at the Flourishing Factory. I must join the Party, improve myself, and do more for our workers and the people." Old worker Comrade Ma Huaide also said to people: "I think like this: students from Beijing and Tianjin run to the liberated areas to find the Communist Party. We old workers, guarding the Communist Party and not knowing how to find the Communist Party, is just not right. In the past, I did not participate in anything. Now the Communist Party looks up to me, and I must participate!" There are many, many more examples like this. Now the factory's General Branch Committee publicly stated that it welcomes these worker comrades to join the Party's ranks, and said: "The Communist Party here expresses to all employees that we heartily welcome active employees to become vanguards and join the Communist Party."

　　繁荣厂中共支部公开
  　百余职工请求入党
    【石家庄市讯】繁荣厂自公开党的总支委后，职工们已掀起入党热潮。至本月一日止，填写申请书要求入党的已有一百二十余人：有普通工人，也有技术工人，有一般职员，也有较高的职员。技师谢咏，在他写的“找到光明”一文中这样说：“我到解放区已快十个整月了，在这里看了共产党全心全意为人民服务的种种事迹，我找到了企求着的光明。我希望成为共产党的一员，给我以更深的教育，巩固我为人民服务的基础，以担当无产阶级先锋队的任务。”老工人杨东山在他“一心寻找共产党”的文章里这样说：“日本占榆次，我在榆次纱厂作工的时候，就常为八路军的人民自卫队、武装工作队工作：帮助他们采买东西，送信，通情报。阎老西占了榆次后，他派的工会在任许树棠审问过我两次，治了我一个多月，叫我承认通八路，我没有承认，直到今年阴历四月二十九日跑了出来，一心想找共产党，想再干革命工作，今天在繁荣厂才找到了，我一定要入党，提高我自己，为咱们工友和老百姓多办事。”老工人马怀德同志也曾向人说：“咱这么想：北平、天津的学生们跑到解放区来找共产党，咱这老工人，守着共产党不知道找共产党，总不对头。过去，我什么也不参加，现在共产党看得起我，我一定参加！”象这样的例子还很多很多。现在该厂总支委员会公开表示，欢迎这些工人同志到党的队伍里来，并且说：“共产党在这里对全体职工表示，我们是热诚的欢迎积极的职工当先锋，参加共产党。”
