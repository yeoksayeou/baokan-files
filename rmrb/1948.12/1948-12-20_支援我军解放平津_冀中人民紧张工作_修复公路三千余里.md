　　【Jizhong Urgent Telegram】 "Fight to liberate Pingjin!" "Fight to liberate all of North China!" The people of Jizhong have urgently mobilized, actively repairing roads, milling rice, and transporting grain to support the People's Liberation Army. The highways crisscrossing the Jizhong Plain, totaling more than 3,350 li, have been largely completed by the people of nearby villages working day and night. In Suining, 20,000 civilians repaired more than 400 li of highways in five days. In Renqiu, the Ping (Beiping)-Da (Cheng) and Jin (Tianjin)-Bao (Ding) highways, totaling 156 li, were repaired in five days. In Qingxian and Cangzhou, the entire county mobilized 80,000 civilians in two shifts to repair the Cang (xian)-Shi (Jiazhuang), Jinpu, and Canghe (jian) highways, totaling more than 100 li. Hejian completed a three-day project in just two days. In Jinnan (newly established county), the Jin-Jian (shan) and Jin-Cang (xian) highways, totaling more than 70 li, were repaired in one and a half days. They were rolled until magnetic, solid, and smooth. Yangzhuang villagers in Xianxian County, upon hearing about the road repair, ate early the next morning and quickly gathered. Out of the village's 70-plus households, 61 people, excluding those milling rice, went to repair the roads. While repairing the roads, they excitedly said, "Let's do it! After we take Pingjin, eliminate Fu Zuoyi, and liberate all of North China!" Many women also came to participate. Three villages in Lixian and Renqiu had 77 women participating. As of the 8th of this month, the Ping-Da, Cang-Shi, Shi-Ding, Jin-Jian, and other highways, totaling more than 3,200 li, have been basically completed.
　　The vast masses in the interior of Jizhong are busy milling rice and grinding flour to support the People's Liberation Army in liberating Pingjin. They are as happy and busy as if they are celebrating the New Year. Zhang Shuijing Village in the fifth district of Jianguo was assigned to mill 10,000 jin of rice, but the village requested to mill an additional 2,000 jin. All 60 mills in the first district of Dacheng are turning day and night. Chenggezhuang in Anguo, because of the small number of mills in the village, used carts to transport grain to smaller villages for milling. When asked if they were cold, they said, "For the sake of welcoming the People's Liberation Army, we are willing to be a little cold." Large quantities of military grain are being transported to the front lines. There aren't enough carts, so the villagers are using handcarts to push. In the four villages of Anxin Haozhuang and Dama Cabinet alone, there are 210 handcarts participating in grain transport. The villagers north of the Daqing River, seeing that they are about to be completely liberated, are working with extra vigor. The 100-plus li highway from Baxian to Wangqingtuo was started on the 3rd and completed by the 8th.

　　支援我军解放平津
  　冀中人民紧张工作
  　修复公路三千余里
    【冀中急电】“为解放平津而战!”“为解放全华北而战!”冀中人民已紧急动员起来，积极修路、碾米、运粮，支援人民解放军。纵横交叉在冀中平原的长约三千三百五十余里的公路，已由附近村庄的人民星夜抢修大部完工。肃宁二万民工，五天内修好公路四百余里。任邱五天修好平（北平）大（城）、津（天津）保（定）两条公路一百五十六里。青沧交全县前后动员八万民工，修好沧（县）石（家庄）、津浦、沧河（间）三条路一百多里。河间三天的工程，两天就完了工。津南（新设县）一天半修好津监（山）、津沧（县）两条路的七十余里。轧的又磁实又平稳。献交县杨庄村民头一天听说要修路，第二天早早就吃了饭，很快集合，全村七十多户人家，除了碾米的以外，六十一个人去修路。他们一面修路，一面兴奋地说：“干哪！打下平津来，消灭傅作义，解放全华北呀！”另有很多妇女也赶来参加。蠡县、任邱三个村就有七十七名妇女参加。到本月八日止，平大、沧石、石定、津监等公路，长约三千二百多里，已基本上修筑完工。
    冀中内地广大群众，则忙着碾米磨面，支援解放军解放平津。他们象过年一样愉快紧张。建国五区指定张水镜村碾米一万斤，该村要求多碾二千斤。大城一区六十盘碾子都在竟日转动。安国程各庄因本村碾子少，用大车拉着谷到小村去碾。有人问他们冷不冷，他们说：“为了迎接解放军，冷点也情愿。”大批军粮正往前方运送。大车不够使用，老乡们就用小车推。仅安新郝庄、大马柜等四村，参加运粮的小车就有二百一十辆。大清河北的老乡眼看自己就要完全解放了，干着特别有劲。从霸县到王庆坨百余里的公路，三日开始，到八日就修完了。
