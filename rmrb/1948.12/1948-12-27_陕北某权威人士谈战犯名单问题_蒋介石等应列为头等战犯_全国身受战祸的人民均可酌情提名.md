　　Shaanxi, December 25th (Xinhua News Agency) - People from all walks of life here are discussing the issue of the list of war criminals. An authoritative figure stated: The complete list of war criminals awaits proposals from all sectors of society nationwide based on the actual situation. However, the top war criminals known throughout the country, such as Chiang Kai-shek, Li Zongren, Chen Cheng, Bai Chongxi, He Yingqin, Gu Zhutong, Chen Guofu, Chen Lifu, Kong Xiangxi, Song Ziwen, Zhang Qun, Weng Wenhao, Sun Ke, Wu Tiecheng, Wang Yunwu, Dai Chuanxian, Wu Dingchang, Xiong Shihui, Zhang Lisheng, Zhu Jiahua, Wang Shijie, Gu Weijun, Song Meiling, Wu Guozhen, Liu Zhi, Cheng Qian, Li Yue, Wei Lihuang, Yu Hanmou, Hu Zongnan, Fu Zuoyi, Yan Xishan, Zhou Zhirou, Wang Shuming, Gui Yongqing, Du Yuming, Tang Enbo, Sun Liren, Ma Hongda, Ma Bufang, Tao Xisheng, Zeng Qi, Zhang Junmai, etc., are guilty of heinous crimes and deserve to be killed by all Chinese people. The number of people who should be included in the list of top war criminals is naturally not limited to these, and this should be proposed at the discretion of the people in various places who have suffered from the scourge of war. The People's Liberation Army is the first to have the right to propose this list. For example, Huang Wei, commander of the Kuomintang's 12th Army Corps, has fully qualified as a war criminal by using poison gas in combat. All democratic parties and people's organizations across the country have the right to discuss and propose lists of war criminals.

　　陕北某权威人士谈战犯名单问题
  　蒋介石等应列为头等战犯
    全国身受战祸的人民均可酌情提名
    【新华社陕北二十五日电】此间各界人士谈论战争罪犯名单问题。某权威人士称：全部战争罪犯名单有待于全国各界根据实际情形提出。但举国闻名的头等战争罪犯，例如蒋介石、李宗仁、陈诚、白崇禧、何应钦、顾祝同、陈果夫、陈立夫、孔祥熙、宋子文、张群、翁文灏、孙科、吴铁城、王云五、戴传贤、吴鼎昌、熊式辉、张厉生、朱家骅、王世杰，顾维钧、宋美龄、吴国桢、刘峙、程潜、李岳、卫立煌、余汉谋、胡宗南、傅作义、阎锡山、周至柔、王叔铭、桂永清、杜聿明、汤恩伯、孙立人、马鸿达、马步芳、陶希圣、曾琦、张君劢等人，则是罪大恶极，国人皆曰可杀者。应当列入头等战犯名单的人，自然不止此数，这应由各地身受战祸的人民酌情提出。人民解放军为首先有权利提出此项名单者。例如国民党第十二兵团司令黄维在作战中施放毒气，即已充分地构成了战犯资格。全国各民主党派，各人民团体皆有权讨论和提出战犯名单。
