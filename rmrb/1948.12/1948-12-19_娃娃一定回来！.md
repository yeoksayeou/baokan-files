"The children will definitely return!"
    Lin Shichai
    These past few days, the Taiyuan front has been consistently clear, the azure sky without a single cloud. The cave dwellings are dimly lit and quiet. But as soon as you step out of the cave, the situation is different: the mountains and valleys are filled with people. Stretcher teams, transportation teams, laborers, soldiers… some on horseback, some carrying guns, some going forward, some going back. One or two American-made Chiang planes circled twice with a buzzing sound, swooped down for a strafing run, and then left. No one paid any attention to them, silently going about their own business. Only the more outspoken would curse fiercely, "Damn it! Let's see how many more days you can fly!" The sound of artillery grew more distant, meaning the fighting was getting closer to Taiyuan. It reminded the people in the village: Taiyuan must be taken.

    "Old fellow, when will Taiyuan be taken?" my landlord's wife always asked me. Because we called her "old fellow," she also called me "old fellow." "Old fellow" became the most intimate term between us.

    Every time prisoners passed by, she would run to the street to watch. When she came back, she would sigh, shake her head, and mutter to herself, "None of them." Then, she would dejectedly return to her cave dwelling.

    One early morning, her six-year-old granddaughter quietly told me, "My grandma cried half the night."

    I went to light a cigarette on her stove. Her eyes were a little swollen, and her complexion was even yellower than usual. I asked her with concern, "What were you crying about?" She gave a wry smile and then began to pour out her grievances:

    "Old fellow, among those KMT soldiers your Eighth Route Army captured, didn't you see my children? My eldest automatically went out to fight the war the year the Japanese devils came; my second is twenty-eight this year, and the sixth day of June they were grabbed by old Yan. His hands were tied behind his back, and he was sent to the Mingqian Village office. I baked two cakes to send to him, but those officials threw them out… If you had come three days earlier, they wouldn't have been able to grab him—now I don't know if he's dead or alive… More than ten bags of grain we harvested last year were also looted by the KMT soldiers; my family of four is just eating some carrots and bran to survive. If it weren't for you coming, I don't know if my family would still be alive at this point…" She wiped her eyes with her sleeve.

    In the evening, as another unit passed by, she put on her clothes and ran out again. She came back and excitedly told me, "Old fellow, Taiyuan will definitely be taken!"

    "How so?" I asked. "Zhao Rui has defected, I recognize him, he just went by. Old Yan is about to be finished. My children will definitely be able to return."

    As she went outside, she happily repeated, "The children will definitely be able to return."

    Standing in the courtyard, she began to sing a Yangko tune she had composed:

    "The thirty-seventh year of the Republic,
    The thirteenth day of June, the Eighth Route Army came to take power,
    The Taiyuan government is at war,
    Capture Old Yan alive and liberate my children."

    After that, I heard her sing that self-composed Yangko tune every day. It was just these four lines repeated over and over. Her worried frown was replaced with a smiling face, and every time she met me, she would say, "The children will definitely be able to return!"

### “娃娃一定回来！”

　　“娃娃一定回来！”
    林十柴
    这几天，太原前线总是晴天，蔚蓝的天连一块云彩也没有。窑洞里微暗而安静。但是一走出窑洞情形就不同了：满山满谷都是人。担架队、运输队、民工、战士……有的骑马，有的背枪，有的向前，有的向后。一架两架美制蒋机，嗡嗡盘旋了两圈，俯冲下来扫射一下又走了，人们谁也不管它，默默地走自己的路。只有好说话的人才狠狠地骂上一句：“妈的！看你还能飞几天？”炮声越来越远，也就是说离太原越打越近。它提醒村里的人们：太原一定要打下来的。
    “老乡，太原啥时候打下来呀？”房东的老婆婆总这么问我。因为我们叫她老乡，她也叫我老乡，“老乡”成了我们之间最亲密的称呼了。
    每次过俘虏她都跑到街上去看，回来以后，她就叹息地摇着头自语说：“没有。”跟着，就垂头丧气地回到自己的窑洞里。
    一天清早，她六岁的孙女悄悄告诉我：“俺奶奶哭了半夜。”
    我去她炉台上点烟，她的眼睛有些浮肿，脸色也比平常更黄，我关切地问她：“你哭什么呀？”她苦笑了一下，接着诉起苦来：
    “老乡，你们八路军俘虏那些勾子军，就没见俺娃娃？俺大的是鬼子来那年自动出去抗了战；二的今年二十八，六月初十叫老阎给抓去啦。倒捆着两只手，送到明谦村公所，俺烙了两张饼给他送去，也叫那些当官的给扔出来……。你们早来三天就好啦，早来三天也不能叫他们抓去——如今不知是死是活……年时打了十几布袋粮食也都叫勾子军抢去；俺一家四口就吃点红萝卜和糠度日，若不是你们来，俺一家不知还活到这时候不哪……”他用袖子擦着眼睛。
    晚上，又过队伍，他又披上衣裳跑出去。回来高兴地告诉我：“老乡，太原一定能打下来啦！”
    “怎的？”我问。“赵瑞都投诚过来了，我认得他，他方才过去。老阎就快完蛋了。俺娃娃一定能回来。”
    临走出去，她高兴地重复着说：“娃娃一定能回来。”
    走到院里，她用秧歌调唱起来：
    “民国三十七年整，
    六月十三日八路军上来坐天下，
    太原府儿在打仗，
    活捉老阎解放俺娃娃。”
    以后，我天天听她唱那自编的秧歌调。就是这四句反复地唱。愁眉苦脸换上了眉开眼笑，一遇上我就说：“娃娃一定能回来！”
