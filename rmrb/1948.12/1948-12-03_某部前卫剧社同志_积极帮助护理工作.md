　　Comrades of a Certain Avant-Garde Theater Troupe
  　Actively Assist in Nursing Work
    [Suiyuan-Mongolia Frontline News] Male and female comrades of the Avant-Garde Theater Troupe of a certain unit of the North China People's Liberation Army, not only carry out cultural and artistic activities for the troops in a frequently fighting environment, but also often help with wartime logistical work. During the Ping-Sui Campaign, they participated in nursing work twice. The second time, they completed the task of receiving and transferring the wounded without a hospital. The male and female comrades of the troupe treated the wounded with unparalleled enthusiasm. One wounded soldier had an abdominal injury and could not drink water. Comrade Jia Wenli moistened cotton to moisten the wounded soldier's mouth. The weather in Chahar was cold, and comrades Guo Farui, Zhao Jianhe, and Yang Zhenbang took off their cotton-padded coats to keep the wounded warm, while they continued to work in single-layer clothing. When there were more wounded, female comrades Qi Fenglian and Cao Binhui participated in the most arduous and strenuous work of carrying stretchers up and down, working as hard as the male comrades. Wang Huimin, regardless of fatigue, went back and forth to fetch water and food for the wounded. Although the weather was very cold, they were sweating profusely. Due to the efforts of the comrades of the troupe, the wounded were greatly moved. Platoon leader Yang Yuzhen and machine gunner Zhang Heng, when they could not turn over and had difficulty spitting phlegm, Cao Binhui and Wang Shuqin let them spit the phlegm into their hands. Platoon leader Yang and Zhang Heng gratefully said, "I am endlessly grateful to you. Even my own younger sister at home is not as enthusiastic as you." Another machine gunner was seriously injured and could not urinate. Because the doctor said, "It is very dangerous if he cannot urinate," the comrades of the troupe actively assisted the doctor to help him urinate. The machine gunner gratefully said, "You saved my life. After I recover, I will definitely return to the front line and fight the enemy and avenge with our platoon leader in the machine gun squad." After the campaign, all the staff of the health center wrote a letter to Director Li of the "Songjiaying" unit and all members of the Avant-Garde Theater Troupe, expressing their admiration for the troupe comrades' hardship and efforts.

　　某部前卫剧社同志
  　积极帮助护理工作
    【绥蒙前线讯】华北人民解放军某部前卫剧社男女同志，不但在频繁战斗的环境下开展部队文艺活动，且经常帮助战时后勤工作。此次平绥战役中，他们曾参加两次护理工作。第二次则在没有医院的情况下，完成收容转送的任务。该社男女同志，以无比热情对待伤员。有一位伤员囊腹部受伤，不能喝水，贾文俪同志便把棉花浸湿来滋润伤员的嘴。察北天气较冷，郭发瑞、赵建和、杨振帮等同志便脱下自己的棉衣给伤员保温，自己却穿着单衣继续工作。在伤员较多的时候，女同志齐奉莲、曹斌辉，参加了最繁重最吃力的上下担架工作，和男同志一样的卖力。王惠敏不顾疲劳，往返给伤员打水打饭，虽然天气很冷，但她们却忙了满头大汗。由于该社同志努力，伤员们大受感动。排长杨玉珍、机枪手张恒，在不能转动吐痰困难时，曹斌辉和王书琴就让他们把痰吐在自己手里。杨排长和张恒都感激地说：“我感激你们不尽。我家里的亲妹妹也没你们这样热心。”另外一位机枪手负伤较重，小便不通，因医生说：“他排不出尿来是很危险的”，剧社同志便积极的协助医生，使他排了尿。机枪手感激的说：“你们救活了我一条命，我好了以后，一定回到前线去，还在机枪班里和我们排长一起杀敌报仇。”战役结束后，卫生所的全体人员，给“宋家营”部李主任和前卫剧社全体写了一封信，感佩剧社同志们的艰苦和努力。  （磊爱友）
