Question: There is a boy in my village, about ten years old now. When he was three years old, he almost died from measles. After being treated by a Chinese medicine doctor, he was left with a condition of "difficulty urinating." When urinating, he screams in pain, his face turns red from straining, and his urine contains a white, thick fluid. Sometimes when it's severe, there's blood in his urine, and he's in constant pain day and night, urinating countless times, and has difficulty with bowel movements. However, the severity changes quickly, and sometimes he seems almost normal. But the good times are rare. He has been treated by countless Chinese and Western doctors, some diagnosing it as gonorrhea, others as sand strangury, but all to no avail. It's been like this for seven or eight years now. What kind of disease is this? What is the treatment? Please recommend a good remedy.

Answer: Your letter is rather simple, making a specific reply difficult. Our opinion is that the child's illness may be "bladder stones." Because he was only three or four years old when he got sick, it's unlikely he has gonorrhea. The stone inside the bladder causes inflammation of the bladder, resulting in the discharge of a white, pus-like liquid. It's extremely painful when the stone is expelled from the urethra, and urethral pain is a natural symptom. If the stone is large and not smooth, it may damage the urethra, resulting in hematuria (i.e., red urine). Sometimes, due to irritation of the urethra, urethritis may also occur, also causing pus to be discharged in the urine. Anyone with this condition often has a large amount of various salts in their urine (these salts are the raw materials for forming stones), which are often mistaken for pus. Treatment can include alkaline medications (such as sodium bicarbonate and urotropin), which can prevent the formation of new stones and promote urination. Or, urotropin 1.5 GM and salol 1.5 GM can be taken orally three times a day, after meals, for several days to be effective. The most effective treatment is surgical removal. He can go to the Urology or Surgery Department of Shijiazhuang Peace Hospital for diagnosis and, after confirmation, undergo surgery to remove the stones.

　　膀胱结石症怎样治疗？
    问：我村有个男孩，现在有十来岁，三岁时因麻疹几乎死去，经中医治疗好后，留下了一种这样的病：“小便不利”。在小便时，痛的大喊，蹩的满脸通红，尿中带有白色的浓汁，有时厉害了，就尿中带血，这时昼夜疼痛不止，小便次数无数，大便不利。可是轻重的变化很快，有时同好人差不多。但好的时候很少。这病经了无数的中、西医生医治，有的按淋症，有的按沙揭，但结果都毫无效验，现已有七、八年的光景。这算什么病？怎样治法？请介绍个良方才好。

    答：来信比较简单，未能具体作复。我们的意见，那个小孩的病可能是“膀胱结石症”。因为他得病还只三四岁，不可能患淋病。结石在膀胱内，使膀胱发生炎症，致有白色的脓样液体排泄出来。结石由尿道排出时非常痛苦，尿道疼痛是当然的症状。结石如大而不光滑时，则可能损伤尿道，就要尿血（即小便发红）。有的时候因刺激尿道，又可能合并发生尿道炎，也要尿出脓汁。凡有本病者，他的尿中常含有多量的各种盐类（此盐类为造成结石的原料），常误认他是脓汁。治疗法可用一些碱性药（重曹与乌罗特品等），可以预防新的结石生成，并可利尿。或可用乌罗特品１．５ＧＭ、撒鲁尔１．５ＧＭ，一日三次分服，饭后服下，连服数日还可有效。最有效的疗法，是用手术摘出之。即可到石门市和平医院泌尿科或外科医治，诊断确定后可行手术，取出结石。（华北政府卫生部）
