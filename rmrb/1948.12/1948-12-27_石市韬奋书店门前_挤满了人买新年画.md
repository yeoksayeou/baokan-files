　　Shijiazhuang Taofen Bookstore Doorway
  　Crowded with People Buying New Year Pictures
    [Report from this newspaper, Shijiazhuang] Recently, the western display window of the Taofen Bookstore on Zhongshan Road has been constantly surrounded by people. It turns out that everyone is looking at the newly displayed colorful New Year pictures.

    These New Year pictures are completely different from the old ones in content and form. They are no longer superstitious depictions of the Kitchen God, 阿芒图 [A Mang Tu], or the Grandmother Bodhisattva. They are reflections and portrayals of the new life and new demands of the people in the liberated areas. For example, "Children's Play" reflects the new children's life in the liberated areas - they vividly and realistically perform Yangko dances about overthrowing Chiang Kai-shek and the US. In "New Year Happiness", "Mutual Aid Spring Plowing Picture", "Abundant Food and Clothing Picture", "Holding a Family Meeting"..., they all show the people's production enthusiasm after the equal distribution of land, and their happy mood after the autumn harvest.

    Passers-by buy the colorful New Year pictures, carefully admiring them, studying the solar terms for the coming year. Some citizens say, "In the past, I didn't have the heart or spare money to buy pictures to paste at home, but now I have to buy a few more to take back." Children squeeze through the crowd to the front of the display window, gesticulating and pulling their parents' hands, demanding to buy one of each...

　　石市韬奋书店门前
  　挤满了人买新年画
    【本报石家庄讯】最近中山路上韬奋书店的西橱窗前总是站满了人，原来大家都在看着新陈列出来的五彩新年画。
    这些新年画与旧的年画在内容和形式上是完全不同的，它再不是迷信的灶王爷、阿芒图或菩萨奶奶了，它是解放区人民新的生活和新的要求的反映和写照。譬如：“娃娃戏”即反映了解放区新的儿童生活，——他们活泼而逼真的演着打倒蒋美的秧歌戏。在“新年乐”、“互助春耕图”、“丰衣足食图”、“开家庭会议”……里，都表现出人民在平分土地后的生产热情，和他们在秋收后的愉快情绪。
    来往的人们，买了五彩的新年画，在仔细的欣赏着，研究着明年的气节，有的市民说：“从前没有心绪和闲钱去买画贴在家里，现在可得多买几张回去”。小孩们从人缝里钻进橱窗前，指手划脚的拉着大人的手，要求每样都买一张………。
