　　Ruhr Problem Has Great Contradictions
　　U.S. Imperialism Forces Britain and France to Submit
　　Large Numbers of Nazi Coal and Iron Factories are Not Dismantled
　　【Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 23rd】A secret Ruhr conference was held privately in London from November 11th by representatives of the six nations of the United States, Britain, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg. According to the Soviet "Pravda," the task of the conference was to discuss and draft regulations for the Ruhr's production and distribution mechanisms. Due to contradictions among the U.S., British, and French governments in resolving the German question, the conference was interrupted several times. After the application of various pressures by U.S. imperialism, Britain and France submitted. Agence France-Presse reports that the conference is likely to conclude soon.
　　The prominent contradiction between the U.S., Britain, and France is manifested in the issue of dismantling German factories. When the U.S.-British West German Factory Dismantling Committee met in Düsseldorf in late November, the U.S. side requested that Ruhr steel production should be raised to the pre-war level of 15 million tons per year. The British side proposed that West German steel production capacity should only be maintained at 10.05 million tons per year, with the remainder dismantled as reparations. France also opposed the U.S. proposal to increase steel production. At the time, their debate was inconclusive. At the beginning of this month, the U.S. "German Reparations Advisory Committee," headed by the general manager of U.S. Steel, Humphrey, arrived in Berlin. The Telecommunications Agency reported that this committee would submit a report based on its research to Harriman, the European executor of the Marshall Plan, to decide, "for the sake of European interests," to stop dismantling certain factories already on the dismantling list. Subsequently, the Telecommunications Agency reported that the U.S. Embassy in Britain had warned Britain and France not to oppose the U.S. decision to cancel the dismantling of German factories. Otherwise, the United States would temporarily suspend the supply of the Marshall Plan to Britain and France. On the 6th, Humphrey's committee began meeting at the British Foreign Office, with Hoffman and Harriman both in attendance. Senior British and French officials attended only as observers. On the evening of the 7th, the meeting decided to remove 150 units from the dismantling list. At the same time, the British side was asked to agree to stop dismantling another 300 large factories. Britain succumbed to U.S. pressure. When the Ruhr conference resumed on the 13th, the British Foreign Office issued a statement saying, "Bevin will not hold a special meeting with the French representatives on the West German issue." The Telecommunications Agency pointed out that this statement from the British Foreign Office was the result of U.S. pressure.

　　鲁尔问题矛盾很大
    美帝压迫英法屈服
    大批纳粹煤铁工厂竟不拆卸
    【新华社陕北二十三日电】美英法荷比卢六国代表十一月十一日起在伦敦私下召开秘密的鲁尔会议，据苏联真理报称：会议的任务，系讨论草拟管制鲁尔生产和分配机构的章程问题。由于美英法政府在解决德国问题时存在着矛盾，会议在进行中曾数度停顿，经过美帝国主义施用种种压力以后，英法屈服了。据法新社电称，这一会议可能即将结束。
    美英法之间突出的矛盾表现在拆卸德国工厂问题上。美英两国西德工厂拆卸委员会于十一月下旬在杜塞尔多夫集会时，美方曾要求鲁尔钢产应提高至战前每年一千五百万吨的水平，英方则提议西德钢铁生产力只能保持每年一千零五十万吨的水平，剩下的拆卸作为赔偿。法国亦反对美方提高钢产的主张。当时他们之间的争论没有结果。本月初，以美国钢公司总经理汉夫莱为首的美国“德国赔偿顾问委员会”抵达柏林。电通社称，此一委员会将以研究所得向马歇尔计划欧洲执行人哈里曼提出报告，以决定为“欧洲利益计”而停止拆卸若干业已列入拆卸名单的工厂。其后，据电通社称，美国驻英大使馆曾警告英法，不要反对美国关于取消德国工厂拆卸的决定。否则美国将暂时停止对英法马歇尔计划的供给。六日，汉夫莱的委员会开始在英外部集会，霍夫曼和哈里曼均出席，英法高级官员则仅以观察员身份列席。七日晚，会议决定从拆卸单上勾销一百五十个单位。同时，又要求英方同意停止拆卸另外的三百家大工厂。英国在美国的压力下屈服了。延至十三日鲁尔会议复会时，英外部发表声明称：“贝文将不与法国代表就西德问题举行特别会议。”电通社指出，英外部的这一声明，是美国施用压力的结果。
