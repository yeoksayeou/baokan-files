　　Shvernik
　　Is the Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. He is sixty years old this year. His father was a worker, and he himself worked as an apprentice and a lathe operator. He joined the Communist Party at the age of seventeen. After the October Revolution, he led the work of the All-Soviet Central Council of Trade Unions. At the 16th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party, he was elected as a member of the Central Organization Bureau, and at the 18th Congress, he was elected as an alternate member of the Politburo, and in 1946 as a full member. In March 1946, he succeeded Kalinin as the current position.

　　Most Favored Nation
　　When two contracting countries conclude a treaty of commerce or other treaties, if it is stipulated that if either contracting country grants any rights to a third country in the future, the other contracting country shall also enjoy the same rights in that country. This is called the most-favored-nation clause, and the countries that conclude the treaty are called most-favored nations. Although this clause nominally grants equal opportunities to both countries, if the two countries are of different strengths, such as an imperialist country and a weak country concluding a most-favored-nation clause, then it is unequal.

　　Calorie
　　Or written as Calory, is a unit of heat. The amount of heat required to raise the temperature of one kilogram of water (approximately equivalent to twenty-seven taels in China) by one degree Celsius is called one calorie. The food we eat every day is digested to supply our body's consumption, and in physiology, it is calculated in calories.

　　Mark
　　Is the name of the German currency unit. After Germany's unconditional surrender, the Marks in circulation at that time were the "Reichsmark," "Allied Mark," and "Rent Mark." In June of this year, in order to obtain materials from the Soviet-occupied zone and carry out the conspiracy to split Germany, American imperialism violated the agreement and issued the "Deutsche Mark" in the American, British, and French occupied zones; in order to protect the interests of the working people, the Soviet Union had to implement currency reform, circulating the original Marks with a special mark to resist it.

    最惠国
    两缔约国缔通商条约或其他条约时，规定缔约国此方如以后让第三国在该国享有任何权益，则缔约国彼方亦应在该国享有同等权益，这叫做最惠国条款，缔约的国家叫最惠国。这种条款，名义上两国虽享有同等机会，但如两国强弱不同，如帝国主义国家与弱小国家缔结最惠国条款，则是不平等的。
    卡洛里
    或写作加路里，是热量的单位，一千瓦的水（约合我们中国二十七两重）上升摄氏温度表一度时所需的热量，叫一个卡洛里。我们每日吃的食物经过消化，供应我们身体的消耗，在生理学上是用卡洛里来计算的。
