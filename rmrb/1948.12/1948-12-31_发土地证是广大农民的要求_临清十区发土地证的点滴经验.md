Issuing Land Certificates is the Demand of the Broad Masses of Peasants
　　Some Experiences in Issuing Land Certificates in the Tenth District of Linqing
　　In the Tenth District of Linqing, after the redistribution and exchange of land concluded the land reform, it became clearer that issuing land certificates was the demand of the broad masses. To meet this demand from the masses, rapidly determine land rights, and develop production, land certificates were issued universally. The methods were roughly as follows:

　　I. How to Arrange It
　　The district first studied the land certificate. In order to promote the work smoothly, it specifically convened a one-day meeting of village cadres from the entire district (mostly village finance and grain cadres, etc.). The district reported on the significance of issuing land certificates, the method of filling them out, the cost of filling them out, organizational leadership, and other specific issues. After discussion and research, all doubts and problems were resolved one by one before returning to the village to carry out the work.

　　II. Conduct Publicity and Explanation Based on Mass Feedback
　　1. All classes after the redistribution of land have an urgent demand to determine land rights. Therefore, issuing land certificates is the demand of the broad masses. The most active are the peasants and new middle peasants who were allocated land. They said, "Farming relies on documents. Without documents for the allocated land, one always feels insecure." At the same time, some poor and middle peasant households, due to fleeing famine, death of family members, enemy arson, loss, etc., no longer had complete old documents. Therefore, they felt that "the old documents are lost, without documents, I'm always worried. After the land certificate is issued, there will be no more changes." Although the land of the middle peasants was not moved, they also demanded that land rights be determined as soon as possible so that they could concentrate on production. Women reflected: "This time, we have truly turned ourselves over. Our names are written on the documents, and men and women will have a share in the future." Landlords and rich peasants, because of several struggles and changes in land rights, were also willing to end the land reform and determine land rights as soon as possible. 2. Some of the masses did not have a sufficient understanding of the land certificate. They felt that "it is not as deeply rooted as the old documents." They were taking care of both ends, counting on whichever was useful. At the same time, they felt that the land certificate only issued one certificate for many plots, which was not as clear as one certificate for one plot, and the terrain could be drawn on it. Some were unwilling to take out the old documents because they were afraid that they would be burned, those who had secretly concealed land were afraid of being fined, individual middle peasants were afraid of the land being moved again, and some with less land did not take out the old documents, deliberately asking to have it measured. 3. According to the feedback from the masses, before filling in the forms, a village-wide meeting must be held to publicize and explain to the masses. (1) Emphasize determining land rights, explaining that the land reform has ended, and that in the future, we must concentrate on production and become rich. Poor peasants must become even richer through production. The land of middle peasants will definitely not be moved, and landlords and rich peasants should produce well, and there will be no further reckoning in the future. (2) Land is allocated to each person, and the entire family can discuss when filling out the land certificate. One certificate per household is also acceptable, or a woman can fill out a certificate herself if she wishes. (3) The land certificate is the proof of land and real estate ownership. All old documents are invalid, and you can burn them, discard them, or save them as you wish. (4) Those who have secretly concealed land can report it without being fined, and those with less land can measure it and fill it in according to the actual amount currently planted.

　　III. Organization and Division of Labor for Issuing Land Certificates
　　Filling out land certificates is jointly the responsibility of the village government and the peasants' association. Organize a land certificate issuing committee, with four sections (or groups) under it. Small villages can merge to reduce groups or personnel. 1. Problem-solving Section: Handling problems such as the division of house foundations among several families, boundary disputes among several families sharing a piece of land, and other problems that the masses cannot solve themselves. 2. Measurement Section: Generally, those without problems do not need to be measured, or they can measure it themselves, only uniformly converting it into the municipal scale issued by the government. Only select problematic plots and plots that the masses cannot measure themselves to measure. 3. Filling Section: Several people can be set up, preferably two people organizing a team, one reading and one filling in, only filling in the first copy, and the remaining two copies are copied by others or at leisure later to save time. 4. Supervision Section: Served by the administrative group leader or the peasants' association group leader. The group leader is responsible for supervision in whichever group they are in, thus avoiding the phenomenon of randomly running into problems.

　　IV. Resolution of Several Specific Issues
　　1. For out-of-town population and dependents of revolutionary army soldiers, fill in "Peasants' Association" under the resident or householder item on the land certificate, and a new certificate will be established when distributed to someone in the future. 2. For primary schools and village governments retaining houses, fill in "某 Village Primary School" or "某 Village Village Government" under the resident or householder item on the land certificate. 3. Old documents are invalid, but do not need to be burned, and those who wish to take them back for preservation may be allowed. 4. For land bordering two counties, where the size is different, the land belongs to which county and should be measured according to the scale of that county (it should be based on the municipal scale). 5. In the future, if land needs to be transferred due to land sales, family division, divorce, marriage, etc., it is recommended that the government issue a "Land Sales Contract" in the future to facilitate land transfer.

### 发土地证是广大农民的要求　临清十区发土地证的点滴经验

　　发土地证是广大农民的要求
  　临清十区发土地证的点滴经验
    临清十区在抽补调换土地结束土改中，更明确了发土地证是广大群众的要求。为满足群众这一要求，迅速确定地权发展生产，普遍进行了发土地证，其作法大略如下：
  　一、如何布置
    区对土地证先作研究后，为了工作顺利推进，专门召开了一天全区的村干会议（多是村财粮干事等），由区报告发土地证的意义及填写办法、填写费用、组织领导等具体问题，经讨论研究一切疑难问题逐一解决后，再回村进行工作。
  　二、根据群众反映进行宣传解释
    一、抽补土地后的各阶层，对确定地权的要求很迫切，因此发土地证是广大群众的要求。表现最积极的是分地的贫农及新中农，他们说：“种地凭文书，分的地没有文书老觉得没有把柄。”同时中贫农中有些户由于逃荒、人口死亡、敌人焚烧、失没等原因，老文书也不全了，所以觉着“老文书失没了，没文书，老不放心，发了土地证以后可没更改了。”中农中虽然土地没动，但也要求早些确定地权，以便安心生产。妇女反映：“这回真翻身了，文书上写了咱的名，以后男女都有一份。”地主富农因为几次的斗争，地权变动，也愿意早些结束土改，确定地权。二、有一部分群众对土地证认识不够，他们觉着“不如老文书根深”，两头都顾着，那个顶用那个算，同时觉着土地证是好多地块只发一张，不如一块地一张清楚，可以把地形画上。他们有的不愿把老文书拿出来，原因是怕拿出来烧了，有黑瞒地的怕罚，个别中农怕再动地，有的地少不拿老文书，故意叫丈量等。三、根据群众反映，在填写以前，必须召开全村村民大会，向群众宣传解释。（一）强调确定地权，说明土改已经结束，以后要安心生产，发家致富。贫农要从生产中更进一步发家。中农土地肯定不动，地富好好生产，以后再不清算。（二）分地是一人一份，填写土地证时可全家商议，一户一张也可，如分家或妇女愿自填一张也可以。（三）土地证是土地房产的凭据，老文书一概作废，愿烧、愿丢、愿保存听便。（四）有黑瞒地的报出来不罚、地少时可以丈量，按现种的实数填写。
  　三、发土地证的组织分工
    填土地证由村政府农会共同负责，组织发土地证委员会，下设四个股（或组），小村可合并减少组或人。一、处理问题股：处理几家伙分宅子地基问题，几家伙分一块地的边界地邻纠纷等群众不能自己解决的问题。二、丈量股：一般没问题者可不丈量，或自己丈量，只统一折合为政府发的市尺即可，只选择有问题的地块及群众不能自己丈量的地块去丈量。三、填写股：可多设几人，最好由两人组织一班，一人念一人填，只填第一联、余两联交别人或后来闲时腾写，以节省时间。四、督促股：由行政组长或农会组长担任，到那一组，组长即负责督促，这样避免乱碰头的现象。
    四、几个具体问题的解决
    一、在外人口及荣军留地在土地证居民或户主项下填“农会”，将来分给谁另立新证。二、小学及村政府留房，在土地证居民或户主项下填“某村小学校”或“某村村政府”。三、老文书作废，但不必烧毁，愿拿回保存者可允许。四、两县交界地，尺寸大小不同，地属哪县的按哪县尺寸（应以市尺为标准）。五、今后因土地买卖分家离婚、嫁娶等土地需要转移时，建议政府将来应发“土地买卖契约”，以利土地转移。（冀南区党委办公室）
