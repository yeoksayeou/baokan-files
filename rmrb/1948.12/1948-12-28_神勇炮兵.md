　　A certain infantry brigade presented the "Hundred Shots, Hundred Hits" banner to the Xihai Second Company of the Second Field Artillery Brigade.

　　On the night of the 12th, they advanced towards the Naoma Fortress in coordination with the infantry. This 3,000-jin field gun had to pass through long, deep trenches full of mud and puddles, and then climb high mountains. All the commanders and fighters of the company took off their cotton coats and used several thick ropes to pull it upwards. Platoon Leader Liu Wenhua, who came from a working-class background, led the shouting: "Comrades, pull harder!" Everyone echoed in unison: "Pull harder, eh!..." "Take down Taiyuan City! Capture Yan Xishan alive!..." Every step required drilling holes on the slope to secure the gun. Reaching the bottom of the stone bluff, they had to descend from a slope inclined at sixty to seventy degrees and two to three hundred meters high. Every step required making a turning mechanism. The sky was pitch black, and they had to be extremely careful and meticulous. A slight carelessness would send both people and the gun rolling into the ditch. People were worried and exhausted. The intense work drenched their clothes in sweat. Thus, from dusk until midnight, the field gun climbed up and down the deep mountains, passing through thick fog and darkness.

　　At the front line, where bullets were flying in all directions, Company Commander Li personally led the selection of positions, quickly constructing fortifications, erecting pillars, and putting up large beams, sweating profusely from the effort. Once the gun was in position, they hurriedly padded the tail, leveled the wheels, aimed at the target, and selected ammunition. Skilled movements quickly completed the preparations, and only then did people enter the bomb shelter. However, an intense discussion ensued, planning the fire steps. Political Instructor Li proposed: "We must demonstrate hitting the target at 1,500 meters and make contributions for the people here." Gunners, ammunition handlers, and surveyors all responded enthusiastically: "Guarantee to cover the infantry's capture of Naoma!"

　　At dawn, the battle began, and the muzzle continuously and fiercely spewed fire, preventing the enemy from raising their heads. The assault team advanced but was blocked by the enemy. However, a shell flew over and blasted the enemy's machine gun into the air, cutting it in two. The brave infantry charged up with the momentum. The enemy brought in another machine gun, but before it could be set up, another shell had already overturned the machine gun position, burying both men and guns. The assault team took advantage of the smoke and dust to climb to the front line. However, a pile of grenades was thrown from the front line, exploding with "boom, boom...". The heroic gunners rotated the elevation screw and fired quickly. The shell landed, overturning the enemy's front-line grenade-throwing trench, and the demolitionist bravely climbed up.

　　At this time, the enemy artillery group in Yangjia Yu and Shuangta Temple fired dozens of shells at the Second Company's position, shaking the ground violently. Machine gun bullets pierced the wheel spokes and bounced off the shields and gun barrels, but our gunners ignored it, aiming and firing, causing the enemy artillery group to panic and fire wildly east and west, with mountain gun shells, field gun shells, and howitzer shells flying everywhere.

　　Hundreds of enemy shells landed around the Second Company's position, collapsing the firing point. Geng Xiaozha, nineteen years old, saw that the muzzle was blocked and hurriedly jumped out with Cao Wuqun to clear it, but after firing only two shots, it was damaged again by the enemy. The two of them jumped out again to clear it. Shells exploded nearby, and they bravely crawled down and quickly got up again to clear it. The more urgent the situation, the more carefully the gunners aimed, calmly fired, and the fierce artillery fire landed on the enemy's group positions. The more panicked the enemy became, the less accurate they were. The suppressed enemy, seeing that the gun pillbox was about to be destroyed and could no longer provide cover, dragged the gun and fled in a panic. The enemy artillery group's position was then occupied by us.

　　The extremely vicious Yan bandits fired gas shells from Shuangta Temple, landing beside the Second Company's position. The foul-smelling, sour odor spread, drilling straight into their noses and mouths. Everyone used the gas masks and urine-soaked towels they had prepared in advance to cover their mouths and noses, struggling with teary eyes, overcoming the unbearable suffocation. They thought: "As long as we can move, we cannot let the gun stop firing." As the infantry approached the edge of the trench, the artillery fire quickly turned to the main pillbox. The first shell went in through the gun hole and drilled out behind the pillbox, immediately creating a rotten wound. The infantry shouted their approval and charged up. The brigade leaders praised: "Truly a divine gun that hits wherever it is aimed!"

　　The counter-attacking enemy, forced by the supervising officer's sword, rushed up. The mobile Second Company fired a shrapnel shell, and dozens of them fell. The remaining ones crawled and rolled, desperately running back. Immediately following, another group charged up. As soon as the gun fired, they shrunk back and never came up again. The infantry charged up and victoriously occupied the entire Naoma Fortress.

　　A captive who had not died crawled out of the pile of corpses. Terrified, he said as soon as he opened his mouth: "What powerful guns!"... The captured Yan bandit battalion commander used both hands to illustrate: "When your infantry advances to the wrist, the artillery fire hits the back of the hand. When the infantry charges on the back of the hand, the artillery fire immediately switches to the fingers. I have never seen such good coordination!"

　　The infantry comrades discussed, "I heard there were divine guns, this must be the divine guns."

　　The infantry comrades, with affection and respect, sent sheep and cigarettes to comfort the Second Artillery Company.

　　神勇炮兵
    徐灵
    步兵某旅把“百发百中”的大旗，奖赠给野炮二旅西海二连。
    十二日夜晚，他们协同步兵向淖马要塞挺进，这三千斤重的野炮，通过到处是泥洼而漫长的深沟，然后要爬上高山，全连指战员脱了棉衣，用几根粗绳往上拉运，工人出身的排长刘文华领着喊：“同志们加油拉呀！”齐声和着：“加油拉呀，＠吓！………”“打下太原城呀！活捉阎锡山呀！………”拉一步要在斜坡上打眼停住，拉到石咀子下又要从倾斜六七十度、高二三百公尺的斜坡滑下，每下一步要打制转机。天是漆黑伸手不见五指，要极端小心而仔细，稍不注意，连人带炮就会滚下沟去。人们又担心又吃力，紧张的工作者，汗水湿透了衣服。就这样，从黄昏到半夜，野炮在深山里爬上爬下，穿过了浓雾和黑暗。
    在子弹纵横飞舞的前沿，李连长亲自领着选择阵地，很快的构筑工事，架柱子，上大梁，累得满头大汗。炮进了阵地，又急忙垫架尾，平两轮，瞄好目标，挑好弹药，熟练的动作迅速的完成了准备工作，人们才进入避弹室里去。但是，接着紧张的讨论开始了，计划着火力步骤。李政指提出：“要发扬一千五百米开炮命中，要为人民在这里立功。”炮手、弹药手、测量员，都热烈地响应着：“保证掩护步兵夺取淖马！”
    拂晓，战斗开始了，炮口连续猛烈地喷出火光，打得敌人不敢抬头。突击队前进，被敌人封锁了道路；可是一颗炮弹飞去，把敌人那挺机枪轰在空中，截成两断，勇猛的步兵，随着冲上去。敌人又运来一挺机枪，没等放稳，又一颗炮弹早把那机枪阵地炸翻了，连人带枪埋葬了。突击队就趁烟尘登上前沿，但是前沿上投出一堆手榴弹“轰轰……”的炸开了，英勇的炮手转动升降镙，迅速发射，炮弹落处，又把敌人前沿的投弹槽打翻了，爆破员便勇敢的爬上去了。
    这时杨家峪、双塔寺敌人炮群用几十发炮弹射向二连阵地，轰得满地乱颤，射来的机枪子弹，穿透了车辐，在防盾上、炮筒上乱跳，可是我们的炮手并不理它，瞄的瞄，打的打，打得敌人炮群惊惶失措，昏头昏脑的东一炮西一炮，山炮弹、野炮弹、榴弹炮弹……漫天飞舞。
    敌人几百发炮弹射在二连阵地周围，打塌了火口，十九岁的耿小渣一看堵住了炮口，急忙和曹武群跳出去整理好，但刚打两炮又被敌人打坏了，他俩又跳出去整理，炮弹在跟前炸开了，他俩勇敢的爬下又急速的起来整理。炮手们越紧急，就越仔细瞄准，沉着发射，那猛烈的炮火落在敌人集团阵地上，敌人越恐慌就越打不准。被制压的敌人看着就要毁灭的炮碉不能掩蔽了，就拉着炮狼狈地跑了，敌人炮群阵地就为我们占领了。
    阎匪穷凶恶极，从双塔寺发射出毒气弹打在二连阵地傍，那散布着难闻的酸臭味，直钻进口鼻，大家把早已准备好的防毒品和浸尿的手巾堵住口鼻，挣扎着泪眼，克服了难以忍受的窒息，他们心想：“只要能动就不能让炮停止发射”。步兵接近沟沿，炮火急速转向主碉，头一炮从枪眼打进去在碉后钻出来，登时就开了个烂疮口，步兵叫着好冲了上去，步兵旅首长赞扬着说：“真是神炮指哪打哪！”
    反扑的敌人被督战刀逼着扑了上来，机动的二连一个榴散弹几十个就倒下了，剩下的连滚带爬拼命的跑回去。紧跟着又是一群冲来，炮一响缩回去再也上不来了，步兵冲上去，胜利的全部占领淖马要塞。
    从尸堆里爬出未死的俘虏。吓的他一开口就说：“好厉害的炮呀！”……俘虏来的阎匪营长，他伸出两手来比喻说：“你们步兵进到手腕，炮火就打到手背上，等步兵冲在手背上，炮火立刻转到手指上，真没见过这样好的配合！”
    步兵同志议论着，“听说有神炮，这大概就是神炮。”
    步兵同志们以友爱和敬意，送来羊、香烟，慰劳炮二连。
