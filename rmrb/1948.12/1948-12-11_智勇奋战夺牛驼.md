(I) Niutuo Mountain Spitting Flames

Northeast of Taiyuan City, ten miles outside the Xiaodongmen (East Small Gate), lies Niutuo Mountain, the precipitous military fortress of the Yan bandit. Historically, Li Zicheng of the late Ming Dynasty seized this mountain and thus gained Taiyuan. During the Japanese puppet regime, defenses were set up in this area to protect Taiyuan City and the steel plants and armories at the foot of the mountain. After the Yan bandit "took over" Taiyuan, they rebuilt bunkers on this mountain. During the Jinzhong Campaign, when the situation in Taiyuan was critical, many field fortifications were hastily added day and night. The entire position had ten main bunkers. Except for Bunker No. 2, which was a two-story stone bunker, the rest were three-story stone round bunkers, filled with cement and reinforcing steel. Niutuo Ridge was a three-tiered firepower cement-reinforced iron-gated artillery bunker (i.e., Bunker No. 10), 1.5 meters thick. It was surrounded by Bunkers No. 1, 2, and 3 to the west and south, connected to Bunkers No. 8 and 9 extending to the north, and connected to Bunkers No. 5, 6, and 7 extending slightly to the east. Laoye Ridge, about a hundred meters southeast of the artillery bunker and southwest of Bunker No. 5, was the command bunker (designated as No. 4, also known as the Temple Bunker, remodeled from the Laoye Temple). A T-shaped road connected the artillery bunker and Bunker No. 6. Forming a large isosceles triangle. Below the artillery bunker, a cement tunnel passable by four columns ran northwest to Niutuo Village and Taiyuan, and southeast to the command bunker. Southeast of the command bunker, another tunnel ran through other friendly positions to Taiyuan. Thus, standing on Bunker No. 10, one could see very clearly: Bunkers No. 1, 2, and 3 to the west and south were its satellites, Bunkers No. 8 and 9 to the north, and Bunkers No. 5, 6, and 7 to the northeast, were its two sharp horns, and Bunker No. 4 to the southeast, facing away from Taiyuan, was the heart that commanded these bunker groups.

Each main bunker on the Niutuo Mountain fortress occupied a hilltop, separated by deep gullies, capable of independent combat. The distance between bunkers ranged from over two hundred meters to just a hundred meters, with mutually supporting firepower. The main bunker positions were surrounded by "gelengs" (irregular mounds or small hills) one to two and a half zhang high. The "gelengs" around the artillery bunker had as many as eleven layers. Above the "gelengs" were outer trenches built using the natural terrain, and two-zhang-high steep slopes. Behind the steep slopes were roof-shaped barbed wire fences, with pillboxes at the four corners of the barbed wire. Between the pillboxes and the main bunkers were network-like communication trenches. On the narrow roads approaching the outer edge of the position, there were also firepower points to block shooting. The precipitous Niutuo Mountain, which was extremely difficult to climb in the past, now, spitting flames from the hidden, densely packed firing ports and loopholes, had become a fiery spider web, a mountain of flames.

(II) Winning the Battle Opportunity

Winning a battle opportunity in military terms is not easy; it requires not only bravery and wisdom but also a certain price paid in blood.

On the night of October 17th, as the enemy on Niutuo Mountain watched in fear the attack on Yulinping in front of them, another People's Liberation Army spearhead had already thrown the enemy in front behind them, penetrated more than twenty miles into their inner defense line, and pounced on them. The soldiers, using ingenious methods, dug a few small pits on the steep slopes where they could place their toes, climbed up, and occupied Bunkers No. 5, 6, and 7. In the enemy's fierce counterattacks, on this narrow position less than one hundred meters long and less than three meters wide, on the 18th, they counterattacked four times, firing more than six thousand shells. On the 19th, from 9:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m., they counterattacked nine times, firing eight thousand shells. On the 20th, the enemy fired only two hundred shells and did not attack.

On the fourth day, the enemy redeployed their forces. Sixty-odd mountain and field guns and heavy mortars fired from the west, south, and north. The fortifications that had been repaired three times were also destroyed. The soil was pulverized, and dust filled the air, blinding and deafening. Light and heavy machine guns could not fire, and even rifles could not be cocked. The soldiers, standing on boxes full of hand grenades, holding two hand grenades in one hand, said:

"Come on! We have hand grenades waiting for you!"

The enemy fired ten thousand shells at us, and we returned many hand grenades.

Soldiers Zhou Jishan and Ma Dengliang had their legs broken by shells, bit their teeth and stood up, fell down in pain, and then climbed up again to fight the enemy with hand grenades. Wu Zhixiang's fortifications were destroyed. He climbed out of the dirt and knelt to fire. Cook He Jintu brought food and joined the fight, repelling three enemy counterattacks. The barber had his hat shot off but continued to transport ammunition on the front line. The tighter the artillery fire, the faster they transported. Every second, every combat action of the soldiers faithfully carried out the order: Hold the forward position already gained.

Due to the tenacity of our army, we held on for four days and four nights, cutting off the retreat of the entire Dongshan enemy, winning the opportunity to attack and disintegrate the enemy retreating in the Mengjiajing area. Occupying important artillery positions, controlling the North Airfield, and cutting off the Yan bandit's air links. It also allowed our army to take the entire Dongshan as a base, converge from north and south, and from a commanding position, directly break through the fortress line under Taiyuan City. When the order to defend the second line of defense was received, our commanders and fighters still longed for Niutuo Mountain. They looked back, eagerly longing for Niutuo Mountain, burying boundless hatred.

(III) Inside the Firepower Net

After the 26th, a certain unit of our army attacked Niutuo Mountain twice. Facing this Niutuo Mountain spitting flames, what should be done? Any underestimation, arrogance, reliance on old experience, or recklessness would not work. This was a test, and what was needed was the wisdom to command the battle.

Commander Cai, after accepting the experience of neighboring units, first recognized that Bunker No. 10 was the head of the entire position. Attacking only from Bunkers No. 5, 6, and 7, even if they were occupied, would still be the enemy's forward positions. Therefore, he proposed that Bunkers No. 5, 6, and 7 should still be attacked by the original unit, and another spearhead should be sent directly to take Bunker No. 10 and Bunker No. 8. In this way, the enemy's firepower net would be completely divided, and we could sneak into the net to catch fish. However, to strike the enemy in this way required great courage.

Thus, under the guidance of this tactical thinking, cadres above the squad level, assault groups, and demolition groups went to scout the terrain every night, and studied the sand table at home during the day, adding new enemy situations to the sand table every day. They sneaked into the enemy's pillboxes and got under the "geleng" (mound) thirty meters away from the enemy. On the night of the 31st, the soldiers climbed up the road they had familiarized themselves with. This was the road the enemy themselves used to travel back and forth, and there were no landmines. The enemy did not realize it at all. By the time they heard the footsteps, the explosives had already detonated. The pillbox collapsed, and the soldiers climbed up the ladders. At a place twenty meters close to the main bunker, they launched a hand grenade battle. After close combat with bayonets, even the Japanese officers in the Tenth Regiment of the Yan-Japanese coalition force, who were relying on to defend this position, could not hold out. When the explosives detonated, the artillery bunker collapsed, and they all perished together.

On November 1st, only the Temple Bunker, where the headquarters of the Tenth Regiment was located, remained on Niutuo Mountain. Under the gunpoint and blade of the law enforcement team and Japanese commanders, the enemy launched five counterattacks on Bunker No. 10. In the communication trenches, the loose soil from the shell explosions was already buried to the "knees". When the hand grenades were gone, in the most urgent situation, the soldiers calmly dug open the accumulated soil, searching for the enemy's abandoned hand grenades to fight the enemy. Finally, under the volley fire of two rifles, the Japanese commander was shot down, and the enemy ran around like a scattered flock of sheep.

(IV) "Visible, Can't Run!"

On the 14th, our army captured the Temple Bunker. The underground room, prepared by the Japanese invaders for air defense, ready to open a factory and place machines, was also blown open by us. The cement and steel structure, nine chi high, and twelve zhang thick, was broken open, and we charged in.

Now, the soldiers live safely in the underground room. Whenever enemy planes come, they proudly laugh:

"Come bomb us! Thanks to your Japanese fathers."

The battle of Niutuo Mountain was unprecedentedly fierce. The soil on the ground was turned into furnace ash. The soldiers dug one zhang and four chi deep to build fortifications. Now, Niutuo Mountain is truly "impregnable" in the hands of the People's Liberation Army. Everyone is busy looking at Taiyuan City. Looking at it from Niutuo Mountain, it looks just like looking at the bottom of a basin. When the weather is clear and the Fen River is not foggy, the pedestrians on the roads of Taiyuan City can be seen clearly through the telescope. Based on the experience of liberating Yuncheng and Linfen, the soldiers, lying in their observation holes and firing holes, pointed at Taiyuan City and said:

"Visible, can't run!"

    智勇奋战夺牛驼
    耿西  王天章  王西一
    （一）喷着火焰的牛驼山
    太原城东北，出小东门十里，便是阎匪这座悬崖削壁的军事要塞牛驼山了。历史上，明末李自成曾夺此山而得太原。牛驼山主峰牛驼岭标高一二五八公尺，日伪时期，曾在这一带设防，屏卫太原城及山下的炼钢厂、兵工厂。阎匪“接收”太原后，复在这架山上修筑碉堡。晋中战役时期，太原形势危急，又星夜加修许多野战工事。全阵地共十个主碉，除二号碉是二层片石碉外，其余均是三层片石圆碉，中间灌以水泥钢筋。牛驼岭是三层火力的水泥钢筋铁门炮碉（即十号碉），厚一公尺五。其西、南面有一、二、三号碉围绕，正北连接伸出八、九号碉，正东略为偏北，又接连伸出五、六、七号碉。距炮碉东南与五号碉西南各百十公尺的老爷岭，便是指挥碉（编为四号，亦称庙碉，就老爷庙改修而成），炮碉与六号碉之间，有丁字形的汽车路贯通。形成一个大等腰三角形。炮碉之下，有可通过四路纵队的水泥暗道，西北可通牛驼村至太原，东南可通指挥碉，指挥碉东南又有暗道，经过其它友邻阵地，通至太原。于是，你站在十号碉上，可以看得很清楚：西面至南面，一、二、三号碉是它的卫星，正北的八、九号碉，正东偏北的五、六、七号碉，正好是其两只尖锐的牛角，而其东南背向太原的四号碉，正是指挥这些碉群作战的心脏。
    牛驼山要塞上的每个主碉，各占一个山头，其间有深沟相隔，能单独作战。碉与碉之间，最远者相距二百多公尺，最近者仅及百公尺，互相间火力均能支援，主碉阵地外围，环绕着一丈至两丈五的“圪楞”，炮碉外围的“圪楞”竟有十一层之多。“圪楞”之上，有就自然地形砌成的外壕，与高达两丈的劈坡，劈坡之后，有屋顶形的铁丝网，铁丝网四角有伏地堡，地堡与主碉之间，有网线似的交通壕，在接近阵地外沿的隘路上，又有阻拦射击的火力点。险峻的牛驼山，从前即极难攀，如今，在隐藏着密若繁星的射击口与枪眼之中，喷射着火焰，已成了火蜘蛛网，成了火焰山了。
  （二）赢得战机
    在军事上赢得战机是不容易的，那不独需要勇敢，智慧，而且要付予一定的血的代价。
    十月十七号深夜，当牛驼山的敌人，心惊胆怕的望着他前面被攻击的榆林坪时，人民解放军的另一个箭头，早已把当面的敌人扔在屁股后面，穿进其内防线二十多里，直扑到他们面前了。战士们以急智的方法，在劈坡上刨了几个能放下脚尖的小坑坑，便爬上去，攻占了五、六、七号碉。敌人在猛烈的反扑中，在这块纵不及一百米，横不到三米的窄狭阵地上，十八号即反扑四次，打了六千多发炮弹。十九号从上午九时到下午六时后反扑九次，打了八千发炮弹，廿号，敌人只打了二百发炮弹，没有来进攻。
    第四天，敌人重新部署了兵力，六十余门山野炮重迫击炮群，从西、南、北三面打来，三次重修的工事也被摧毁了，土打酥了，尘土弥天，耳目失明，轻重机枪不能打，甚至于步枪也拉不开拴了。战士们脚蹬着满盛手榴弹的箱子，一手抓着两颗手榴弹说：
    “来吧！有手榴弹等待着你们！”
    敌人打了我们一万发炮弹，我们还击了他许多的手榴弹。
    战士周吉山、马登良的腿被炮弹打断了，咬着牙站起来，痛得昏倒了又爬起来跟敌人拼手榴弹。武志祥的工事打垮了，从土里爬起来，单人跪着射击。炊事员何进土送饭参加打退了敌人三次反扑。理发员把帽子打掉了仍在火线上运送弹药，炮越打的紧，他们越运送的快。战士们每一秒钟，每一个战斗动作，都在忠实的执行着：坚守既得的前进阵地。
    由于我军的顽强，坚守了四天四夜，切断了整个东山敌人的归路，赢得了战机、攻击与瓦解了退守在孟家井一带的敌人。占领重要的炮兵阵地，控制了北飞机场，割断了阎匪空中的连系。并使我军以整个东山为依据，南北会师，居高临下，可以直破太原城下的堡垒线。当奉到守第二道防线的命令时，我们的指战员仍恋恋不忘于牛驼山，他们回过头去，热望着牛驼山，埋藏了无限的仇恨。
  （三）火力网里
    二十六日以后，我军某部曾两次攻击牛驼山下。面对着这座喷着火焰的牛驼山怎样办呢？任何的轻敌、骄傲、摆老资格、拼命主义都不行的，这是一种考验，这里需要的是指挥战斗的智慧。
    蔡团长接受了友邻部队的经验，首先认识了十号碉是全阵地的首脑。仅从五、六、七号碉攻击，即使占领了也还是敌人的前沿阵地，因此他提出，五、六、七号碉，仍由原部队攻击，再派一个箭头，直取十号碉和八号碉。这样，敌人的火力网完全被分割，我们可以钻进网里捉鱼了。但是，要这样打击敌人，需要极大的勇敢。
    于是，在这种战术思想指导之下，班以上的干部、突击组、爆炸组，每天晚上去摸地形，白天里在家里摆沙盘研究，每天沙盘上都增加了敌人的一些新的情况。他们摸进了敌人的土地堡，摸到离敌人卅米的“圪楞坎”下边。卅一号晚上，战士们顺着自己摸熟了的路爬上去，这里是敌人自己前后来往走的路，一颗地雷也没有，敌人完全没有发觉，等他们听着脚步响的时候，炸药已经响了，地堡倒了，战士们从梯子上爬上来了，在接近主碉二十米的地方，展开了一阵手榴弹战，与白刃扑搏以后，阎匪藉以防守这一阵地的阎日合流的十总队里的日本军官也不行了。炸药一响，炮碉垮了，他们也同归于尽。
    十一月一日，牛驼山只剩下住着十总队司令部的庙碉了。敌人在执法队与日本指挥官的枪逼与刀砍之下，向十号碉进行了五次反扑。交通壕里，炮弹打下的虚土，已经可以埋住“圪膝盖”，当手榴弹也没有了，情况最紧急的时候，战士们冷静的挖开积土，寻找着敌人遗留下来的手榴弹和敌人拼。终于在两支步枪排射之下，打倒了那个日本指挥官，敌人便象被打散的羊群一般地乱跑了。
  （四）“看得见，跑不了！”
    十四号，我军攻占了庙碉，日寇为了防空，准备开工厂放机器的地下室，顶九尺，墙丈二厚的水泥钢骨建筑物也被我们炸开条口子，攻进去了。
    现在，战士们安全的住在地下室里，每当敌人飞机过来的时候，他们骄傲的笑道：
    “来炸咱们吧！多谢你们的日本爸爸。”
    牛驼山的战斗是空前激烈的，地面上的土，打成炉灰了。战士们挖进一丈四尺深做工事，现在，牛驼山在人民解放军手里，才真正“固若金汤”了。大家在忙着看太原城，从牛驼山看它，正好象看盆子底。当天气清朗，汾河里不起雾的时候，在望远镜里，太原市马路上的行人都可以看得清，战士们爬在自己的了望孔与射击孔里，根据解放运城与临汾的经验，指着太原城说：
    “看得见，跑不了。”
            （十一月二十日太原前线。）
