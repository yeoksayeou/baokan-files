　　Chiang Kai-shek's "Currency Reform" Turns Gold into Stone
  　Six Thousand Silver Dollars Become One Cent
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 11th] Contrary to the magicians in legends who could turn stone into gold, the Kuomintang government's "currency reform" magic turns gold into stone everywhere. An old man, Feng Xin, a resident of No. 1 Yixiang Lane, Longjin East Road, Guangzhou, had saved more than 560 Hong Kong dollars in his lifetime. After the "currency reform," he exchanged it all for counterfeit gold yuan. In November, after he read in the newspaper that the gold yuan had suddenly depreciated by 80 percent, he became mentally disturbed and angrily tore up all the counterfeit gold yuan he had exchanged. Someone in Tianjin deposited 20 million "legal tender" into a foreign bank in October of last year. At that time, according to the Kuomintang's Central Bank exchange rate, the amount could be exchanged for about 200 US dollars, or, according to the black market exchange rate, it was worth more than 100 US dollars. After the "currency reform," the amount fell to 6.70 counterfeit gold yuan, still worth 1.675 US dollars. However, after the Kuomintang government announced the "revised" method, the amount had depreciated to 0.3305 US dollars. Furthermore, a resident of Shantou, Guangdong, deposited 6,337.30 yuan in the Kuomintang Postal Savings Bureau on the eve of the Anti-Japanese War. At that time, it was all silver dollars, which could be used to buy 50 or 60 mu of land or 400 or 500 shi of rice. After the "currency reform," this huge sum of money, including principal and interest, was "legally" converted by the Postal Savings Bureau into one cent of counterfeit gold yuan on the books.

　　蒋匪“币改”点金成石
  　六千块现洋变成了一分钱
    【新华社陕北十一日电】与传说中的魔术家能够点石成金相反，国民党政府的“币改”魔术到处点金成石。广州龙津东路驿巷一号住户老人冯信，一生积蓄港币五百六十多元，“币改”后全部兑了伪金圆券。十一月间，他读报得知金圆券一下子贬值百分之八十以后，神经失常，愤而将兑来的伪金圆券全部撕掉。天津有人于去年十月以“法币”二千万元存入某一外国银行，当时该款按蒋记中央银行挂牌汇价约可换得美金二百元，即按黑市汇价折算，亦值一百美元以上。经“币改”后，该款即跌为伪金圆券六元七角，尚值美金一点六七五元。而至国民党政府宣布“修正”办法后，该款已贬为美金零点三三零五元了。又广东汕头一住户抗战前夜在国民党邮政储金局存款六千三百三十七元三角，当时全是银洋，以之买田可买五六十亩，买米可买四五百石。“币改”后，这笔巨款本息竟被邮政储金局“依法”在帐面上折存伪金圆券一分。
