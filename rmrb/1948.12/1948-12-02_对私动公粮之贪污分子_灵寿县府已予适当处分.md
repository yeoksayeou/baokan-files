　　Embezzlers Who Moved Public Grain for Private Use
  　Appropriately Punished by Lingshou County Government
    To the Editor:
    Regarding the article "Some Villages in Lingshou Embezzling and Stealing Public Grain" published in the Criticism and Suggestions column of the People's Daily on September 18th, our county immediately launched an investigation and handled the matter upon seeing the report. The actual situation of the case and the handling results are explained as follows:
    Li Laomu, the director of the grain depot in Nanjicheng Village, Fifth District of Lingshou, privately borrowed 180 jin of wheat from the grain depot in March of this year, and another 48 jin of corn in April. Together with village chief Li Laoru and preferential treatment committee member Shang Laohui, they privately used 1,200 jin of wheat and 121 jin of corn from the grain depot as capital to open a store in the village. In addition, to please the masses, they privately borrowed out 8,000 jin of wheat, 1,000 jin of corn, 600 jin of millet, and 80 jin of black beans. After investigation by the finance and food group, this situation was confirmed. Li Laomu and the other two confessed without denial and were handed over to the government for legal processing. In order to protect revolutionary property and support the Liberation War, the government must severely punish embezzlers and thoroughly rectify the grain depot. Based on the fact that Li Laomu, as the director of the sub-depot, not only failed to strictly control and manage the grain but also privately used large quantities of public grain, which is not allowed by the financial and grain system, he was sentenced to five years of imprisonment. Village chief Li Laohui and preferential treatment committee member Shang Laohui not only failed to criticize and stop Li Laomu from privately using public grain but also colluded with him in malpractice, acting extremely selfishly, and were deemed unfit to hold office as cadres. They were immediately removed from their posts as a form of education.

　　对私动公粮之贪污分子
  　灵寿县府已予适当处分编辑同志：
    九月十八日人民日报批评建议栏内登载“灵寿有的村庄贪污盗卖公粮”一文，本县见报后，当即着手调查处理，兹将该案实际情况与处理结果说明如下：
    灵寿五区南冀城村，粮秣村分库主任李老目，在今年三月私自借用粮库麦子一百八十斤，四月间又借玉茭四十八斤，并与村长李老儒、优抚委员尚老会，私用粮库麦子一千二百斤、玉茭一百二十一斤，作为资金，在村开店；另外为讨好群众，又私自借出麦子八千斤、玉茭一千斤、小米六百斤、黑豆八十斤等。此一情况，经财粮组调查属实后，李老目等三人亦供认不讳，遂送交政府依法处理。政府为保护革命财产，支援解放战争，必须严惩贪污分子，彻底整顿粮库。根据李老目身为分库主任，对粮食不但不严格掌握管理，反而私自大批动用公粮，实为财粮制度所不容许，故判处有期徒刑五年。村长李老会，优抚委员尚老会，对李老目私动公粮，不但不予批评制止，反而与其共同作弊，自私已极，不堪任职干部，即予以撤职处分，以示教育。
