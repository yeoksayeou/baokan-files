Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains, 29th — Under the influence of the great victories of the People's Liberation Army's autumn offensive, especially after the successive liberation of Zhengzhou, Kaifeng, Nanyang, and other places, the people of the Central Plains Liberated Areas have undergone significant changes in their thinking. In rural areas, the vast number of farmers have further realized their own strength and are enthusiastically supporting the People's Liberation War. In the democratic movement for reasonable burden, in counties such as Lushan, Baofeng, and Linru in western Henan, many villages and townships challenged each other, proposing "No concealing of land, early payment of public grain, payment of good grain," etc., as competitive conditions, with unprecedented enthusiasm and intensity. During the Zheng-Bian Campaign, stretcher transport teams poured in from all directions with high morale. Many stretchers, when going up and down slopes and passing through difficult places, were accompanied by the coordinated shouts of the laborers who tried to keep the stretcher steady and reduce the pain of the wounded. Keenly perceptive intellectuals swept away their past hesitation and joined the ranks of the revolution in groups. Central Plains University, which had only recruited more than 500 students in the past few months, has seen its student population increase to more than 1,900 in less than a month after the liberation of Zhengzhou and Kaifeng. The Baofeng County training class originally planned to recruit 100 people, but 300 people came within a week. Many who were not admitted were unwilling to go back, saying, "It would be good to stay and audit." The Western Henan Cadre School recruited 60 students in the past two months of September and October, but in the most recent week, more than 200 have come. More than 500 young intellectuals participated in the autumn conscription work in Yibei (north of Yiyang) County and were all very active and diligent. The Fourth District of Western Henan (governing Dengfeng, Gongxian, Mixian, Sishui, and other counties), which relies on Zhengzhou, originally had a very closed atmosphere. Many young intellectuals, after repeated persuasion and mobilization, were unwilling to go to school, let alone participate in work, but this time, as soon as the recruitment announcement for the art school was posted, more than 20 middle school students went to sign up the next day.

Landlords who had fled to the Kuomintang areas, seeing that running with Chiang Kai-shek was a dead end, returned home in large numbers. Shen Qingfeng, a landlord from Pinggaocheng in Lushan County, said to people after moving back home, "Seeing that the Kuomintang is not working out, Nanyang can't be defended either. I have returned home to abide by government laws and be law-abiding." In the first district of Luoyang alone, from November 6th to 10th, 39 Kuomintang members and Three Youth League members registered with the people's government, handing over their party cards, league cards, and letters of appointment. Enemy and puppet armed forces and bandits remaining in the Central Plains Liberated Area, awed by this victorious situation, surrendered to us one after another. In the Western Henan Liberated Area, more than 10,000 bandits have been eliminated in the recent two or three months, half of whom were disintegrated by our political offensive. After the liberation of Zhengzhou, in Mixian County, adjacent to the city, more than 200 enemy and puppets surrendered with their weapons within two or three days. After the liberation of Kaifeng, more than 2,000 scattered bandits in neighboring counties surrendered with their weapons in small groups or in whole batches. Special agent armed forces left behind by the Kuomintang also voluntarily registered with the people's government for self-renewal, and have now handed over 40 carbines. The impact of the victory is not only reflected in politics, but also in the economy. Prices in various places have generally fallen back to the level of early October. The prestige of the Zhongzhou currency is even higher. In the Sixth District of Western Henan (governing Nanyang, Neixiang, Zhenping, and other counties), except for a few marginal and remote areas, there is no circulation of counterfeit currency. The Fifth District (governing Lushan, Baofeng, Xiangcheng, Yuxian, and other counties), with a population of more than 2 million, has become a market exclusively dominated by the Zhongzhou currency. The people of the Central Plains have a clearer understanding than before that the Central Plains will always belong to the people.

[Ji-Lu-Yu Electric Dispatch] Under the influence of the successive victories of our Liberation Army, coupled with the joint defense and suppression of the masses by our local armed forces, and the correct implementation of the lenient policy, from the 1st to the 11th of this month, scattered bandits who surrendered to me in Quhe County included: Chang Xinliang, captain of the pseudo-Ministry of National Defense Kaifeng Assault Brigade, and more than ten others; Li Qianchen, head of the pseudo-Kaifeng Huangling Township, and more than ten others; Wang Sen of the pseudo-Kaifeng Command, and more than ten others; Gao Qianxiang, company commander of the pseudo-Ji Bao 12th Regiment; Li Zhanqing and Guo Sihai of the pseudo-Changyuan Longfeng Town, etc., a total of 18 village and town leaders and 28 captains, carrying 8 machine guns, 3 grenade launchers, 14 Mauser pistols, 152 rifles, 42 shells, and some rifle bullets. Currently, all bandits in the county, except for three small groups of miscellaneous bandits such as Li Huan'er in Zongyingji, have surrendered. The entire Quhe County has now transitioned from a guerrilla situation to a stable one.

　　胜利鼓舞下中原人民觉悟提高
  　农民踊跃参战缴公粮知识分子结队来我区
    【新华社中原二十九日电】在人民解放军秋季攻势巨大胜利影响下，特别是郑州、开封、南阳等地相继解放后，中原解放区的人民在思想上发生了显著的变化。在农村中，广大农民进一步认识了自己的力量，并热情地支援人民解放战争。在合理负担的民主运动中，豫西鲁山、宝丰、临汝等县，许多村与村、乡与乡互相挑战，提出：“不瞒黑地，早缴公粮，缴好粮”等，作为竞赛条件，热烈紧张为历来所未有。郑汴战役时，担架运输队，从四面八方涌来，情绪高涨。许多担架在上下坡及经过难走之处，民工们前喊后应，力求抬得稳当，减少伤员的痛苦。感觉锐敏的知识分子，一扫过去的犹豫观望，成群结队地站到革命的行列里来。中原大学，在过去好几个月中仅招生五百余人，郑、汴解放后，不到一个月，学生已增加到一千九百余人。宝丰县训练班，原招生一百人，但一周内来了三百人，许多未录取的，硬不愿回去，说“留下旁听也是好的”。豫西干部学校，过去九、十两个月招收了学生六十人，最近一个星期即来了二百余。宜北（宜阳之北）县秋征工作中，有五百余青年知识分子参加，都很积极努力。靠郑州的豫西四分区（辖登封、巩县、密县、汜水等县），风气原极闭塞，好多青年知识分子，曾经再三说服动员，亦不愿上学，更不愿参加工作，但此次文艺学校招生布告刚贴出后，第二天就有二十余中学生前往报名。
    逃亡到国民党区去的地主，眼看跟蒋介石跑是死路一条，大批回家。鲁山县平高城地主沈青峰搬回家后向人说：“眼看国民党不行了，南阳也守不住，我回到家里来遵守政府法令，安分守己。”国民党员和三青团员，仅在洛阳一区，在十一月六日至十日五天内，即有三十九人向人民政府登记，交出他们的党证、团证和委任状。残留在中原解放区的敌伪武装和土匪，震慑于这一胜利形势，纷纷向我投诚。豫西解放区最近两三个月内，已消灭土匪万余人，其中半数是为我政治攻势所瓦解的。郑州解放后，与该城邻近之密县，两三天内即有敌伪二百余携枪投诚。开封解放后，邻近各县已有两千余散匪零星地或整批地携枪投降。国民党遗下之特务武装，亦有自动向人民政府自新登记者，现已交出卡宾枪四十支。胜利的影响不但表现在政治上，而且表现在经济上。各地物价普遍回跌至十月上旬水平。中州币的威信更高了，豫西六分区（辖南阳、内乡、镇平等县）除很少的边缘偏僻地带外，已无伪币流通。二百余万人口的五分区（辖鲁山、宝丰、襄城、禹县等县）已成为中州币独占市场。中原的人民已经比以前更清楚的认识到中原永远是属于人民的了。
    【冀鲁豫电】在我解放大军节节胜利影响下，又加我地方武装结合群众联防清剿，同时正确执行宽大政策。从本月一日至十一日十日内，曲河县向我投诚之散匪计有：伪国防部开封突击大队队长常新亮等十余人，伪开封黄陵乡等乡乡长李乾臣等十余人，伪开封指挥部王森等十余人，伪冀保十二团六连连长高乾祥，伪长垣龙凤镇李占清、郭四海等以上共计十八股乡、队长廿八名，携机枪八挺，掷弹筒三个，匣枪十四支，步枪一五二支，炮弹四二发，各步枪子弹一部。现全县境内除总营集李焕尔等三小股杂匪外，已全部投诚至。此曲县全县已由游击局面进入稳定。
