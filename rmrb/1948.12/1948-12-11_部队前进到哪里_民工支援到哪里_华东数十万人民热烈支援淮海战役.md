    Where the Troops Advance, the Laborers Support
    Hundreds of Thousands of People in East China Enthusiastically Support the Huaihai Campaign

    Xinhua News Agency, Huaihai Front, 7th – Hundreds of thousands of laborers in the East China liberated areas are enthusiastically supporting the Huaihai Campaign. Thousands upon thousands of stretchers, carts, wheelbarrows, carrying poles, and pack donkeys are active along hundreds of miles of the Huaihai Front. The laborers are in high spirits, transporting supplies and ammunition and transferring the wounded for the People’s Liberation Army day and night in the cold wind and water. In Suxian East County (east of Suxian, newly established), in the past week, 1,300 stretchers, over 700 carts, over 270 wheelbarrows, and donkey teams have been dispatched to support the front, transporting hundreds of thousands of pounds of grain to the front lines. Laborers from Weihaiwei, Jiaodong, traveled over 2,000 li, with no one dropping out of the 500-person contingent. Shandong laborers, after their service period expired, continued to serve the front because the battle lines were rapidly moving south, and the reserve laborers had not yet caught up. The slogan put forward by the stretcher team of Junan (south of Ju County, newly established) is: "Wherever the troops advance, we will follow." The laborers take meticulous care of the wounded. While pursuing and annihilating the fleeing enemy on the east bank of the Grand Canal, laborers from the Jiaodong Fourth Brigade braved enemy aircraft bombing and strafing during the day to rush wounded soldiers across the river, successfully completing their mission. The Junan laborers collected money to buy white sugar for the wounded, helped them with their personal needs, and made grass fans to camouflage them from air raids, sending people ahead to scout the depth of the water when crossing rivers and streams. Zhu Zhengzhang, the "Iron Stretcher Bearer" of the Junan stretcher team, carried the wounded for three consecutive nights. Sores developed on his feet, making it difficult to walk, so he used a wooden stick for support, insisting on not resting when others urged him to. The laborers are conducting propaganda work among the people in the new areas, telling them about their own experiences of liberation and the construction of the old liberated areas, and helping them with their labor. Now the laborers are widely launching a campaign to earn merit. Large merit lists are posted on the walls of the villages where the laborers are stationed.

    Xinhua News Agency, Huaihai Front, 9th – The stretcher team of Junan County, Shandong, overstayed their service period and faithfully and arduously served the Huaihai Front, demonstrating the noble class qualities of the liberated working people. The team's original service period was one month, but since mid-September, they have persisted in serving the front for two months, refusing to return home. After the start of the Huaihai Campaign, the team followed the army in rapid advance, continuing to actively request tasks, putting forward the slogan "Wherever our troops fight, we will follow," and actively making plans to earn merit. On the way, Zhu Lifang and Li Delan, who had fallen behind due to weakness, finally caught up after searching for three days. No one in the entire team dropped out in the two months. During transportation, they tried their best to reduce the pain of the wounded. For example, as there are many rivers on the Huaihai Front, they would first send people to brave the cold and go into the water to measure the depth and height, acting as guides before everyone carefully helped stabilize the stretchers across the river. Other acts such as collecting money to buy sugar to feed the wounded and taking off cotton clothing to cover the wounded were common occurrences. Xu Weiyi, a laborer in the team, wore out his shoes, but refused to accept the new shoes offered to him by a wounded soldier, preferring to carry the stretcher barefoot. Zhu Zhengzhang (Communist Party member), the deputy squad leader, was awarded the title of "Iron Stretcher Bearer" at the merit evaluation meeting by the transportation station and was commended by the team headquarters. His deeds are very moving.

    During the campaign, the enemy collapsed and fled a hundred li in one night, and the stretcher team closely followed the troops to pursue the enemy. At that time, Zhu Zhengzhang had a sore the size of an apricot on his right leg, but he still insisted on supporting himself with a crutch in one hand while carrying the stretcher, traveling eighty li back and forth every night, without rest or sleep for three consecutive nights. The cook Zhu Zhengkuan didn't want him to carry, but couldn't take the carrying pole away from him. It took much persuasion from instructor Hu Jianchen to take over for a few li, only to have him snatch it back. His care for the wounded was meticulous. He bought sugar, but fearing the wounded wouldn't eat it, he secretly put it in their water for them to drink. To protect them from air raids, he wove a raincoat out of straw to cover the wounded.

    In the stretcher team, he usually sweated the most and carried the heaviest load of grain. When the squad was cooking, he always carefully measured the rice to avoid waste. Sometimes when there was less food, he would eat slowly, letting everyone else eat their fill before eating his fill. In Chongzhuang, when the superiors instructed them to bring cooked rations, he got up in the middle of the night and pushed the millstone, making cakes for the whole squad. When the weather turned cold, everyone had brought bedsheets. He led the squad in grinding soybeans to make tofu and eating bean dregs, saving money on vegetables and solving the problem of cotton quilts.

    He often conducted propaganda among the residents in the stationed areas, helping them with their work, helping farmers dig peanuts and helping landlords harvest beans.

    华东数十万人民热烈支援淮海战役
    【新华社淮海前线七日电】华东解放区数十万民工热烈支援淮海战役。成千成万的担架、大车、小车、担子和驮驴活跃于数百里的淮海前线。民工们情绪很高，在寒风冷水中日日夜夜地为解放军运送给养弹药和转运伤员。宿东县（宿县以东，新设县）最近一周内有一千三百付担架、七百余辆大车、二百七十余辆小车和驴子队出动支援前线，将数十万斤粮食运送前方。胶东威海卫民工远征二千余里，五百人中无一减员。山东民工于服务期满后，因战线迅速南移，后备民工尚未赶上，继续为前线服务。莒南（莒县以南，新设县）担架团提出的口号是：“部队前进到那里，咱们跟到那里。”民工们对伤员爱护备至。在追歼运河东岸西逃敌人时，胶东四大队民工，在白昼冒敌机轰炸扫射，抢送伤员渡河，胜利地完成任务。莒南民工集款买白糖给伤员吃，扶助伤员大小便，做草扇子给伤员伪装防空，过河涉水预先派人探测。莒南担架团“钢铁担架员”朱正章连续三夜抬送伤员，脚上生疮不好走，就拿根木棒拄着，旁人劝他休息，他坚持不肯。民工们对新区人民进行宣传工作，向他们介绍自己的翻身故事和老解放区的建设，并帮助他们劳动。现在民工们正广泛开展立功运动。在民工驻村的墙壁上，张贴着大幅的功劳榜。
    【新华社淮海前线九日电】山东莒南县担架团逾期不归，忠诚艰苦服务淮海前线，表现了翻身劳动人民高贵的阶级品质。该团服务期原为一个月，自九月中旬起，已达两月仍坚持服务前线不肯回家。淮海战役开始后，该团随军急进，继续积极要求任务，提出“咱队伍打到哪里，咱就跟到哪里”的口号，纷纷订出立功计划。在途中，因体弱掉队的朱立纺、李德兰两人，经三天摸索后终于跟踪追上，两月中全团无一减员。转运中，他们想尽办法使伤员减少痛苦。如淮海前线河流较多，就先派人冒寒下水测量深浅高低，在前面作向导，然后大家才扶稳担架过河。其他如集款买糖喂伤员，脱下棉衣给伤员盖等都是常有的事。该团民工徐未一的鞋子走破了，但却不肯接受伤员送给他的新鞋，宁愿赤着脚抬上担架走。该团副班长朱正章（共产党员）曾在评功会上得到运输总站奖为“钢铁担架员”，并受到该团团部的通报表扬。他的事迹是非常使人感动的。
    战役中，敌人一夜即溃逃百里，该担架团就紧紧跟随部队追赶敌人。当时朱正章右腿上正生了一个疮，疮口有杏子大，但仍坚持着一手扶拐棍，一面抬担架，每夜往返八十里，一连三夜不休息不睡眠。炊事员朱正宽不叫他抬，怎样也夺不下扁担来。指导员胡建琛劝说好一会，才接抬几里路，又被他抢回去。他对伤员的爱护无微不至，买下糖怕伤员不肯吃，就悄悄地放到水里给伤员喝。为了防空，他用稻草织成蓑衣盖在伤员身上。
    在担架团中，他平日流汗最多，带粮最重。班里作饭时，他总要把米量好，以免浪费，有时饭少些，他就慢慢吃，叫大家吃好了，才放量吃饱。在崇庄时，上级指示要带熟给养，他自己半夜起来抱着磨棍推磨，把全班的饼子做好。天气冷了，但大家带出来的都是被单子。他就领导全班磨豆腐吃豆渣，节省菜金解决了棉被的困难。
    他经常向驻地居民宣传，帮助他们干活，帮农民刨花生，帮房东割豆子。
