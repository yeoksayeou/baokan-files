Jinnan Fourth Prefectural Committee Trials Land Certificates
Land Rights Confirmed, Farmers Secure in Production

[This newspaper report] Su Youmin reports: The Jinnan Fourth Prefectural Committee, in seven villages including Daxiaogao Village and Santuying in Nangong, began piloting the issuance of land certificates issued by the North China People's Government at the end of October. After half a month, all levels of rural areas have settled down, universally planning to settle their families, repair houses, step up winter plowing, and start sideline production. Wang Xiangkui, a liberated farmer in Zhangtuying, said, "This house and land are mine now. With cattle and carts, I will definitely work hard to live a good life." Zhang Hengmao, a middle peasant in Dongtuying, said, "The years of 'empty grain' (meaning having taxes without land) have been eliminated for me this time, wonderful!" Woman Sun Darong asked the farmers' association and village government to create a separate contract for her. Darong's mother said, "Chairman Mao thought of everything, so that I, a woman without a male heir, will no longer worry about my daughter!"

At the beginning of the work, the cadres thought that issuing land certificates was "simple and nothing much." After the first investigation, it was found that there were many historical disputes over land and house foundations: some land had no contracts, some mulberry trees (i.e., boundary markers) had been moved, some land deeds were inconsistent due to road damage from carts, some had "empty grain" or still retained black market land; some old house foundation contracts only covered a section of the foundation or a section of the courtyard, without specific dimensions. Some houses had no alleys or gates, and some houses encroached on other people's foundations. Some villages not only had old disputes, but also had errors in the equal distribution during the land redistribution campaign, dividing land and houses into very fragmented pieces, increasing the inconvenience of the masses. There were also historical malpractices such as not paying taxes on moat land, the inability to produce on large cart roads but still having to bear the same burden, and the middle peasants' sentimental attachment to old red contracts. Based on these circumstances, the work team formulated preliminary measures: (1) Measurement: Unified calculation using the new ruler stipulated by the government. Because of the historical changes in the new and old rulers and the inconsistency of the rulers between villages, the acreage was not unified, making it difficult to bear the burden fairly and difficult to calculate. (2) Except for roads for planting crops and small roads, highways, official roads, village-to-village roads, river embankments, and river channels are not counted as land for burden, and large cart roads are generally calculated as deducting land according to eight market feet. (3) Announce the abolition of the old red contracts and call on the masses to exchange them for new land certificates. Old contracts that are clear will be filled in according to the original contract converted into new acres; those without old contracts and old contracts that are unclear will be registered and measured. If the masses still want to keep the old red contracts, they can do so at their own discretion. (4) Moat land belongs to whoever is next to it; whoever plants the trees, whoever digs them up; those that can be cultivated are counted as land for burden. (5) Resolve old disputes in accordance with the principle of "land suitable for cultivation, houses suitable for habitation, and idle foundations suitable for use" for mediation and resolution. (6) Through self-reporting and measurement, achieve a thorough investigation of black market land. (7) The whole village is divided into groups to select temporary representatives to form a land certificate issuing committee, under which are set up investigation registration, mediation, measurement, and filling groups. The method is: cadres carry opinions to the village, rely on the branch, party members, and farmers' association cadres, and then proceed according to the specific conditions of each village. Before starting work, first check whether the land reform is thorough, what is the proportion of each class, and whether there are any resettlement and compensation tasks. The second step is to explain the specific opinions of the branch meeting and the work team's regulations on deducting roads (i.e., not calculating the burden of large roads that do not plant crops), old red contracts, moat land, etc., through the farmers' congress or mass meeting, and produce the land certificate issuing committee. Attention should be paid to the following in the work: (1) Explain the legal guarantee of the land certificate in many ways. Why issue land certificates and its relationship with the peasant masses, etc., and announce that the land certificate is a legal contract in the future. (2) Announce the abolition of the old red contract, explaining that the old red contract is not applicable; if some still want to keep the old contract, they can, but it is best to make the masses ideologically mature. For example, some farmers in Guzhuang said: "The dimensions and acreage of the land have changed, and the old red contract can no longer speak to the land. Changing the contract is like taking off old clothes and putting on new clothes." The committee generally meets at night to collectively discuss, and divides into several groups during the day to measure and mediate. Mediation and measurement are coordinated and problems are resolved on the spot. For fragmented land that is not appropriately distributed in the redistribution campaign, on the one hand, free exchange is called for, and on the other hand, the farmers' association mediates. As a result of Liangzhuang's efforts, there are no fragments of land less than one mu, and each family has a separate courtyard, which the masses are very satisfied with. To resolve historical disputes, mediation and resolution should be carried out in accordance with the principle of "land suitable for cultivation, house foundations suitable for habitation and walking, and idle foundations suitable for use." We should learn more about the historical situation of the dispute, understand the focus of the dispute, obtain the consent of the majority, and propose solutions. The masses are eager to solve these problems, and they all plant mulberry trees and bury charcoal eyes face to face. Black market land is generally privately concealed and often appears on inconsistent land deeds and idle foundations on the edge of the village. In addition to calling for self-reporting, the method of investigation can be based on survey materials to measure by sampling, and avoid universal measurement, which delays production. The successful method felt in the trial is to have sufficient investigation and understanding in advance and propose a method suitable for this area; secondly, through the activities of activists, organize the issuance of land certificates, and each group leads the masses to carry out the work, educating the masses that it is their own movement. (3) In applying the three "suitable"s, we use arbitration to achieve the unity of the masses, pay attention to the opinions of the majority as the basis, so as not to be exploited by a few people.

    冀南四地委试发土地证
    地权确定农民安心生产
    【本报讯】苏幼民报导：冀南四地委在南宫大小高村，三土营等七村，从十月底开始，经半月时间试发了华北人民政府颁发的土地证，农村各阶层都安下心，普遍计划安家，修理房舍，加紧冬耕，着手副业生产。张土营翻身农民王祥魁说：“宅子地这可是我的了，又有了牛和车，我一定好好做活过日子。”董土营中农张恒茂说：“多年的空粮（即有税无地），这一回给我取消了，痛快！”妇女孙大容，要农会、村政府单给她立了一张契，大容娘说：“毛主席想的到，叫我这绝户再不挂着闺女了！”
    开始工作时，干部认为发土地证“简单、没啥”。经过第一次调查后，发觉有许多土地、宅基地的历史纠纷：在土地上有没契的，移了桑棵（即地界）的，因破路滚了车道地契不符了的，有空粮或仍保有黑瞒地的；在房屋宅基上有不少的老契只是地基一段、场院一段，没有阔步。有的住宅没胡同、没街门，有的房子压着别人的地基等。有的村不只有旧纠纷，而且因在抽补时错误的绝对平均分配，把土地房屋分的很零碎，增加了群众使用上的不便。还有壕墙地不纳粮、大车道实际不能生产同样负担等历史积弊、中农思想上对老红契留恋等。工作组根据这些情况，拟定了初步办法：（一）丈量，统一使用政府规定的新尺计算。因历来新旧尺变化和村与村间尺子不统一，亩数不统一，以致不能负担公平，也难计算。（二）除种庄稼的大道和小道以外，公路、官路、村通村的大道、河提、河道都不计为负担地，大车道一般安八市尺计算扣地。（三）宣布旧红契作废，号召群众换新土地证。老契清楚的按原契折合新亩填写，没老契和老契不清的登记丈量，如果群众仍愿保存旧红契，可听自便。（四）壕墙地靠谁归谁，谁栽的树谁刨，能耕种的计算为负担地。（五）解决旧有纠纷，按“土地适合耕种、房屋适合居住、闲地基适合使用”的原则调解解决。（六）通过自报、丈量，达到彻底清查黑瞒地。（七）全村划小组选出临时代表，组成发土地证委员会，下设调查登记、调解、丈量、填写等组。作法是：干部携带意见到村，依靠支部、党员、农会干部，再按各村具体情况进行。工作开始前，首先检查土改是否彻底，各阶层占有比例如何，是否还有安置补偿任务。第二步通过农代会或群众大会，讲明支部会的具体意见和工作组对于扣道（按即不种庄稼的大路不计算负担）、老红契、壕墙地等各项规定办法，并产生发土地证委员会。工作中应注意：（一）多方面讲明白土地证的法律保证。为什么要发土地证及它和农民群众的关系等，宣布土地证是今后的合法契约。（二）宣布老红契作废，讲明老红契不适用；如果有的仍愿保存老契也可，但最好做到群众思想上成熟。如古庄有的农民说：“土地的阔步，亩数变了，老红契已经不能和土地说话了。换契是脱了旧衣裳换上新衣裳。”委员会一般是夜里碰头集体讨论，白天分若干组丈量调解，调解与丈量配合行动，就地解决问题。对于抽补中分配不适当的零碎土地，一面号召自由调换，一面由农会调剂。如梁庄这样作的结果，土地没有一亩地以下的碎块，房子每家一所独院，群众很满意。解决历史纠纷可依照“土地适合耕种，房屋宅基适合居住、走路，闲地基适合使用”调解解决，应多了解纠纷的历史情况，明白纠纷焦点，取得多数人同意，提出解决办法。群众在解决这些问题上，都是争先恐后，都是当面栽好桑棵埋好炭眼。黑瞒地一般是私瞒，多在地契不符和村边闲地基上出现。清查方法，除号召自报，可根据调查材料抽丈，切忌普遍丈量，耽误生产。试作中感到成功的方法是事先有充分的调查了解，提出适合这地区的办法；其次通过积极分子的活动，组织发土地证，各组带领群众进行工作，教育群众认为是自己的一个运动。（三）在运用三个“适合”上，是以仲裁方式，达到群众的团结，注意了以多数人的意见为依据，以免被少数人钻空子。
