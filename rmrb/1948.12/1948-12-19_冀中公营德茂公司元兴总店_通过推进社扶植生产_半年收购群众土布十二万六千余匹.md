Jizhong Electricity: The publicly operated Demao Company Yuanxing Main Store has achieved results by promoting mass production through the advancement society. From January to the end of July this year, the store purchased over 126,000 bolts of civilian cloth through the production advancement societies in nine counties, including Dingxian and Xinle, over the past six months. The method adopted was to take payment before delivery, settle accounts periodically, and charge a 2% handling fee. The average monthly supply of cloth funds was about 12 to 13 million new currency units. Whole bolts of civilian cloth were also processed. To control prices, information was exchanged for purchasing. This not only reduced the administrative procedures for store operators, but also supported the business development of the advancement societies, which in turn used the funds to support mass production. For example, the Xinle Advancement Society exchanged cotton for yarn, and the Raoyang Advancement Society exchanged cotton for cloth, purchasing inferior cotton from the masses and selling good cotton to the masses for spinning. Due to the active support of stores and advancement societies for civilian cloth production, the masses felt very convenient.

In supporting mass agricultural production: In order to enable farmers to turn the fruits of land reform into cash and invest in production as soon as possible, and to supply raw materials for military industry, the store, in conjunction with the advancement societies of seven counties, including Dingxian, Raoyang, and Qingyuan, purchased 112,000 jin of copper, tin, and lead. At the same time, more than 131,800 new currency units were used to purchase a large number of agricultural implements, including more than 100 waterwheels. Through the county advancement societies, a "take first, pay later business relationship" was adopted to provide agricultural implements for mass use. In order to support the production of the masses in the waterlogged areas and plant crops as soon as possible, the store transferred more than 4,000 jin of buckwheat seeds to Anguo and Suning. The Qingyuan branch supplied 16,000 jin of wheat seeds to the waterlogged areas, solving the difficulties of many people lacking seeds.

In military industrial production: In order to supply the needs of the troops and increase mass income, the advancement societies of twelve counties, including Dingxian, Shenze, Wuji, and Gaoyang, were used to purchase 170,000 jin of cotton, increasing the masses' income by 11.96 million new currency units. At the same time, 150 large pots for boiling saltpeter were supplied to the saltpeter producers in Anxin, Boye, and other places, solving the difficulties of the saltpeter producers lacking pots. In terms of business operations, the transactions conducted through the advancement societies accounted for 59.1% of the store's total transaction volume, and the types of business operations were all beneficial to the masses, so the store's prestige was greatly improved.

In the past six months, although some achievements have been made through various businesses, there are still shortcomings: (1) Insufficient understanding of the relationship between the state-owned economy, the cooperative economy, and the private economy. For example, the store only had a simple business relationship with the advancement societies, which resulted in some narrow views, such as fear of delayed payments, fear of losses, and distrust and lack of coordination. (2) The store's business lacked careful planning, and there was a lack of organized contact with the advancement societies and a lack of a fixed meeting system. As a result, some losses were suffered in business operations and in supporting mass production.

In order to overcome the above shortcomings and further support mass production, the store and the directors of the advancement societies of various counties put forward unified thinking, strengthened unity, and clarified the direction at a symposium. In order to do a good job in this winter's production, it is necessary to communicate business and improve business skills. In order to combine with this winter's large-scale production, develop cooperatives, develop the textile industry, and solve the production difficulties of disaster victims, the store plans to purchase a large amount of civilian cloth through the advancement societies of various counties, with a planned purchase of 600,000 bolts this winter. It was also decided to allocate 50,000 jin of cotton funds to the Anguo Advancement Society to support the development of village cooperatives. A portion of white oil and soybean cake will also be purchased for fertilizer. There are also 300 pots ready to be sold to saltpeter producers to solve their difficulties.

　　冀中公营德茂公司元兴总店
  　通过推进社扶植生产
    半年收购群众土布十二万六千余匹
    【冀中电】公营德茂公司元兴总店，通过推进社扶植群众生产已获得成绩。该店自今年一月到七月底，半年来通过定县、新乐等九县生产推进社代购土布十二万六千余匹。其方法是采取先取款后交货，定期算帐，按百分之二抽手续费。每月平均供给布款约新币一千二百万到一千三百万。并进行了土布整庄。为掌握物价，并互相供给情报，进行收购。这样既能减少商店经营人员的事务手续，又能扶植推进社的业务发展，推进社也能利用这些资金扶持群众生产。如新乐推进社以棉换线，饶阳以棉换布，收买群众的次棉花、卖给群众好棉花纺线。由于商店、推进社积极扶植土布生产，群众感到很方便。
    在扶植群众农业生产上：为了使农民将土改中所得的果实，早些变款投入生产，和供给军工原料，该店结合定县、饶阳、清苑等七县推进社代购铜、锡、铅十一万二千斤。同时还用了新币十三万一千八百余元购买了大批农具，光水车就有一百多辆。通过县推进社采取“先取走后交款的业务关系”，供给群众农具使用。为了扶持水区群众生产，早日种上，该店调剂到安国、肃宁荞麦种四千余斤。清苑分店供给水区麦种一万六千斤，解决了好多缺种的困难。
    在军工生产上：为供给部队需要及增加群众收入，通过了定县、深泽、无极、高阳等十二个县的推进社，代购棉花十七万斤，增加了群众新币一千一百九十六万元的收入。同时还供给了安新、博野等地硝民熬硝大锅一百五十口，解决了硝民缺锅困难。该店在业务经营上，通过推进社经营的占全店总交易额的百分之五十九点一，在业务经营品种上，都是对群众有利的，因此商店威信大大提高。
    半年来虽通过各种业务得到一些成绩，但仍有缺点：（一）对国营经济、合作经济、私人经济三者的关系认识不足。如商店对推进社只是简单的业务关系，因此产生了若干狭隘观点。如怕拖款，怕吃亏及不信任、不协调等现象。（二）商店业务缺乏周密的计划，和推进社缺少有组织的联系、缺乏一定的会议制度。因此在营业上及扶植群众生产上受到部分损失。
    为了克服上述缺点，和更进一步的扶植群众生产，该店和各县推进社主任座谈会上，特提出统一思想，加强团结，明确方向。为了把今冬生产搞好，要沟通业务，提高经营技术。该店为了结合今冬大生产，发展合作社，开展纺织业和解决灾民的生产困难，计划通过各县推进社大量收购土布，今冬计划收购六十万匹。并决定拨五万斤棉款给安国推进社，扶持村社的发展。并收购一部分白油和豆饼，供作肥料。还有三百口锅准备卖给硝民，解决硝民困难。
