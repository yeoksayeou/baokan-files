　　International Week
　　On the morning of the 19th, Dutch imperialism declared a new full-scale offensive against Indonesia. The Dutch army, navy, and air force, armed with American equipment, simultaneously launched further incursions into Indonesian territory. Dutch paratroopers landed near Yogyakarta and, in less than half a day, occupied the Indonesian capital, capturing most of the key figures in the Indonesian government, including Sukarno and Hatta.
　　This new military offensive by the Netherlands is the result of consistent US support for the Netherlands and the Indonesian reactionaries adopting a traitorous and anti-people policy. Since Indonesia and the Netherlands established the Linggadjati Agreement in March of last year, US imperialism's interference in Indonesia has become increasingly strong and blatant. The United States has actively helped the Netherlands with money and arms, undermined the Linggadjati Agreement, and encouraged the Netherlands to tear up the Dutch-Indonesian ceasefire agreement of November of the previous year and re-launch a war of aggression. At the same time, the United States used the so-called Tripartite Committee to engage in mediation tricks, pressuring the upper-level traitorous elements of Indonesia to sign the humiliating Renville Agreement on January 17 of this year, and single-handedly created the Hatta cabinet to implement this agreement. This Renville Agreement, created by the United States, reduced the Republic of Indonesia to an autonomous dominion under Dutch rule. As a result, the United States obtained from the Netherlands a guarantee to "sell Indonesian resources at the most favorable prices." However, the greed of US-Dutch imperialism knows no bounds. The Netherlands continued to use political and military provocations to pressure Indonesia to accept new conditions for complete colonization. In the Dutch-Indonesian peace talks since January of this year, the United States, on the one hand, profited from the bargaining disputes between the two sides, and on the other hand, lured Hatta with loans to make further compromises and surrender to the Netherlands. Before the Netherlands launched this new aggression, the US State Department had "constantly exchanged views" with the Netherlands (Associated Press). The small Dutch imperialism, which could not do anything without foreign aid, dared to constantly violate established agreements and launch this barbaric new offensive with this encouragement and support from the United States. For nearly a year, the Indonesian reactionary government, headed by Hatta, on the one hand, faithfully implemented US orders and carried out a frantic anti-communist and anti-people movement; on the other hand, it not only repeatedly expressed its firm commitment to implementing the traitorous Renville Agreement, but also did not hesitate to make further compromises and surrenders. When the Netherlands announced the breakdown of negotiations on the 11th, the Hatta government still sent a note to the Dutch government, obsequiously expressing its willingness to make "certain concessions" to resume negotiations. This policy of compromise and surrender by the traitors of the Hatta government was simply a suicidal policy of handing the knife handle to the Dutch aggressors. This policy greatly fueled the aggressive arrogance of Dutch imperialism, making itself a living captive of the Dutch invading army without any preparation or resistance.
　　This new act of aggression by the Netherlands has been met with armed resistance from the Indonesian people and strong opposition from all sides. Many Indonesian people in Kuningan in West Java and Bondowoso in East Java and other places have taken up arms to oppose the Dutch occupation forces. Many workers, students, and women in the Netherlands, as well as youth and student groups in Czechoslovakia, have protested to the Dutch government. On the 21st, a protest demonstration by the American people took place in front of the Dutch consulate in Chicago.
　　The Bulgarian Workers' Party (Communist Party) convened its Fifth National Congress in Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria, on the 18th. The main task of the congress was to formulate a general line for Bulgaria to move towards socialism. Communist parties from the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Greece, Spain, and the German Socialist Unity Party sent representatives to the meeting. The Bulgarian Workers' Party is the largest party in the Fatherland Front government. Before the war, the number of members of the Bulgarian Workers' Party never reached 40,000, but now it has grown into a mass party with 500,000 members.
　　Other important international events in the past week are as follows:
　　(1) The unreasonable shooting and killing of French Communist Party member Hourlier by the police on the 13th triggered a wave of protests from the French people. 150,000 working people in Paris, filled with grief and anger, participated in Hourlier's funeral on the 20th, and solemnly vowed before the spirit of the fallen comrade-in-arms: to resolutely continue to fight for peace, independence, and freedom.
　　(2) 1.5 million Italian government employees held a 24-hour general strike on the 20th to demand higher wages.
　　(3) The unification congress of the Polish Workers' Party and the Socialist Party, which opened in Warsaw on the 15th of this month, is still in progress. The congress has elected the party's leading organ. The original General Secretary of the Workers' Party and President of Poland, Bolesław Bierut, has been honorably elected as the chairman of the Central Committee of the Unified Workers' Party. 100,000 working people in Warsaw held a mass rally on the 21st to cheer and celebrate the unification of the two major workers' parties.
　　(4) The seven Japanese war criminals, including Tojo, who were sentenced to death by the Far East International Military Tribunal, were hanged on the 23rd.

### 国际一周

　　国际一周
    荷兰帝国主义于十九日早晨宣布向印尼发动新的全面进攻。以美国军备武装起来的荷兰海陆空三军，同时向印尼国土作进一步的侵入。荷兰的伞兵在日惹附近降落后，不到半天功夫，便占领了印尼首都，捕获了苏加诺、哈达等印尼政府的大部首脑人物。
    荷兰这次新的军事进攻，是由于美国对荷兰的一贯支持和印尼反动派采取卖国投降和反人民政策的结果。自印尼于去年三月与荷兰成立了林加牙蒂协定之时起，美国帝国主义对印尼的干涉，即日益加强和露骨。美国积极地以金钱军火帮助荷兰，破坏林加牙蒂协定，怂恿荷兰撕毁前年十一月的印荷停战协定，重新发动侵略战争。美国同时又利用所谓三国调处委员会，玩弄调处把戏，压迫印尼上层叛卖分子于今年一月十七日签订了屈辱的伦维尔协定，并一手制造了执行这个协定的哈达内阁。美国所制造的这个伦维尔协定，将印尼共和国降为荷兰统治下的自治领。美国因此从荷兰方面得到了“以最有利的价格出卖印尼资源”的保证。但是，美荷帝国主义的贪婪是没有止境的。荷兰仍不断以政治、军事等挑衅，压迫印尼接受完全殖民地化的新条件。美国则在今年一月以来之印荷的和谈中，一面利用双方讨价还价的争吵，从中谋利，一面以贷款勾引哈达向荷兰作进一步的投降。当荷兰发动这次新侵略以前，美国务院曾与荷兰“不断交换意见”（合众社）。没有外国援助什么事也不能作的荷兰小帝国主义，就在美国这种鼓励和支持下，敢于不断破坏既定的协定，敢于发动了这次野蛮的新进攻。以哈达为首的印尼反动政府，将近一年以来，一方面，忠实履行美国的命令，进行疯狂的反共反人民运动；另一方面，它不仅一再表示坚决执行卖国的伦维尔协定，而且不惜作更进一步的妥协和投降。当荷兰于十一日宣布谈判破裂后，哈达政府犹向荷兰政府提出照会，卑躬屈膝地表示愿作“某种让步”，以恢复谈判。哈达政府卖国贼们的这种妥协投降政策，只是把刀把子送给荷兰侵略者的自杀政策，这一政策大大助长了荷兰帝国主义的侵略气焰，使自己毫无准备、毫无抵抗地作了荷兰侵略军的活俘虏。
    荷兰这次新的侵略行动，已遭受印尼人民的武装抵抗和各方的强烈反对。西爪哇的库宁干和东爪哇的邦都沃索等地的许多印尼人民，已手拿武器起来反对荷兰占领军。荷兰国内的许多工人、学生和妇女，捷克斯洛伐克的青年和学生团体，都纷纷向荷兰政府提出抗议。美国芝加哥市的荷兰领事馆门前，于二十一日发生了美国人民的抗议示威事件。
    保加利亚工人党（共产党）于十八日在保京索非亚召开第五次代表大会，大会的主要任务，便是要制定为保国走向社会主义的总路线。苏联、捷克、希腊、西班牙等国的共产党和德国统一社会党，均派代表与会。保加利亚工人党是保卫祖国阵线政府中的第一大党。战前，保加利亚工人党的党员人数，从未到达四万人，现已成长为拥有五十万党员的群众性的大党。
    过去一周国际上的其他重要事件如下：
    （一）法国共产党员豪列尔十三日被警察的无理枪杀，引起了法国人民的抗议浪潮。巴黎十五万劳动人民充满悲痛与愤怒，于二十日参加了豪列尔的葬仪，他们在牺牲者的战友灵前庄严地宣誓：坚决地继续为和平、独立和自由而战斗。
    （二）意大利政府雇员一百五十万人，为要求增加工资于二十日举行二十四小时总罢工。
    （三）本月十五日在华沙揭幕的波兰工人党和社会党的统一大会，仍继续进行中。大会已选出党的领导机关，原工人党总书记、波总统贝鲁特，已光荣地当选为统一工人党中央委员会的主席。华沙十万劳动人民于二十一日举行群众大会，欢呼庆祝两大工人政党的统一。
    （四）经远东国际军事法庭判处死刑的东条等七名日本战犯，已于二十三日执行绞刑。
