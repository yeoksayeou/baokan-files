Under the Protection and Support of the Democratic Government
    Changzhi Fur Industry Has Recovered
    The fur industry in Changzhi City has a history of over 500 years. Even today, it remains the primary source of livelihood for more than 3,700 compatriots in Changzhi.
    Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, there were 32 fur workshops in the city. The raw materials were mostly sourced from Gansu and Shaanxi, commonly known as "Xikou goods." The finished products were mostly fine goods (i.e., second-hair furs), sold to Hankou, Nanchang, Tianjin, and other places. Large quantities of raw sheepskin and lambskin were sent to the north. At that time, the technology was very advanced. Before the war, there were more than 680 fully skilled workers. Even today, there is a saying: "Rather give up ten thousand taels of gold and silver than give up the skill I carry. Rather give up my father and mother than give up the stinky fur workshop." During the six or seven years of Japanese imperialist rule in Changzhi, the fur industry was included in military supplies and subjected to control. Especially after the enemy and puppet regime's "security enhancement" movement, the control was even stricter. This period was the most devastating for the fur industry. Workshops collapsed, workers lost their jobs, tools were damaged, and skills were lost. Most of the workers who depended on the fur industry for a living turned to manual labor and the lives of poor urban residents, which created great difficulties for us in developing fur production after liberation.
    Changzhi was liberated in 1945. The fur industry was vigorously restored, but because the old workshops had suffered serious damage, capital and tools were incomplete, and the masses did not understand our policies at the time, most engaged in buying raw materials and selling raw materials, and very few produced finished products. The democratic government has attached great importance to and supported the fur industry since the day of liberation. In August of this year alone, incomplete statistics show that loans amounted to about 900,000 new currency units. In the past three years, the fur industry has generally been developing smoothly. According to statistics in August of this year, five larger fur cooperatives have absorbed 2,570 households' funds, amounting to 200,360 new currency units, employing 54 workers, and regularly employing 20 management personnel. This year, 28,820 pieces of tanned fur were produced. After correcting policies and implementing rectification under the principle of voluntariness, 55 fur groups voluntarily formed by the masses, consisting of 268 households, with 285 laborers participating, have funds totaling about 300,000 new currency units (not entirely accurate, such as the Ma Zhaobao fur group in Nantou Street, which has capital of 200,000 new currency units with only five people. The same applies below). This year, 32,079 pieces of tanned fur were produced. The 124 individual producers have funds of 110,000 new currency units, and this year, 12,689 pieces of tanned fur were produced (Zhao Jincai's household in Qingzhen Street alone produced more than 1,400 pieces of tanned fur this year). In total, more than 70,600 pieces of tanned fur were produced this year. In April of this year, it was understood that the total funds were about 1 million new currency units, and now it is at least over 2 million. With the continuous victory of the People's Liberation War, the objective difficulties caused by war, such as transportation blockades and currency inconsistencies, are gradually decreasing, and favorable conditions are increasing, which will provide a very favorable environment for the development of fur production. Raw materials from Xikou have begun to arrive in the city, and Xikou fur coats have begun to be seen in the city's market.
    The current production volume of the city's fur industry has reached the general level before the war. The general production volume before the war was more than 10,000 fur coats per year. This year, a total of more than 70,000 pieces of tanned fur were produced. In addition to a portion that is not made into finished products and sold to the eastern front, more than 10,000 pieces of finished products are still produced.
    The improvement of technology is a major issue in fur production. After being destroyed by the enemy, technology was lost. The technology for making fox fur goods has been completely lost, and very few young people have the skills. After liberation, especially in this year, it has attracted great attention, but the technology has not yet reached the pre-war level. The number of semi-skilled workers has increased by 47 compared with before the war, and 73 new apprentices have been taken on, and they are gradually improving.
    Winter is approaching, which is the season for the fur industry to sell its finished products for the year. There are a total of ten stores and stalls in the city selling fur goods, with all kinds of fur goods available. Among the main finished products produced this year, large and small fur coats each account for half. The current general prices are roughly as follows: (per piece) second-hair fur coat, 900 to 1,000 new currency units, old fur coat, 600 new currency units, large black fur coat, 450 to 500 new currency units, fur pants, 200 new currency units, fox fur coat, the best is 2,800 to 3,000 new currency units, the general is about 2,000 new currency units, Xikou fur coat (second-hair), 2,200 new currency units, fox fur collar, 200 to 220 new currency units.

　　民主政府保护扶植下
    长治皮毛业已恢复
    长治市皮毛业已有五百余年的历史，直到今天，它仍占长治三千七百多同胞生活来源的主要部分。
    抗战前，本市皮毛业作坊有三十二家，原料多采自甘（肃）陕（西）一带，俗谓西口货。成品以细货（即二毛）居多，销于汉口、南昌、平津等地。大宗生羊皮小羔皮则走往北路。当时技术很发达，战前全把式六百八十多人。至今还流传着这样的话语：“能舍万金万银，不舍随身带艺。能舍爹和娘，不舍臭皮坊。”日本帝国主义统治长市六、七年当中，皮毛业被列入军用品而统制起来，特别是敌伪“治安强化”运动以后，统制更严。这时期内，是皮毛业最受摧残的一段，作坊垮台，工人失业，工具损坏，技术失传。从事皮毛业为生的工人，大都转向苦力工人和贫苦市民的生活中，这给我们解放后发展皮毛业生产以极大困难。
    民国三十四年长市解放了。皮毛业即蓬勃恢复，因旧作坊遭到严重损失，资本工具残缺不全，加以当时群众对我政策不了解，多搞买生卖生，制造成品者极少。民主政府对皮毛业自解放之日起，则给以极大的重视与扶植，只今年八月不完全的统计，贷款在新币九十万元左右。三年来皮毛业一般是在顺利发展着，据今年八月的统计。五个较大的皮毛合作社，吸收了两千五百七十户的资金达新币二十万零三千六百元，雇工人五十四个，经营人员经常有二十人。今年熟出皮二万八千八百二十张。经过端正政策、贯彻纠偏，在自愿的原则下，群众自愿组合起来的皮毛小组有五十五个，共二百六十八户，二百八十五个劳力参加，拥有资金合新币三十万元左右（不够确实，如南头街马招保皮毛小组，五个人即有资本达新币二十万元。下同），今年熟出皮三万二千零七十九张。一百二十四户个体生产的，资金新币十一万元，今年熟出皮一万二千六百八十九张（清真街赵进财一户，今年熟出皮就达一千四百多张）。总共今年熟出皮七万零六百余张，今年四月了解共资金在新币一百万元左右，现在至少达二百万元以上。随着人民解放战争的不断胜利，战争引起的交通阻隔、货币不统一等客观困难，日渐减少，顺利条件日益增加，将给皮毛业生产发展以极有利环境。西口原料已开始来市，西口皮袄在本市市场上已开始见到。
    现在本市皮毛业的生产量已达到战前的一般水平，战前一般生产量每年可产皮袄一万余件，今年共熟出皮在七万余张，除一部分不制成品出售于东线外，尚制成品万余件。
    技术的提高，是皮毛业生产中的大问题，经过敌人摧残，技术失传，在制狐皮货的技术上，已将断根，一般年轻人会技术的很少。在解放后，尤其在今年一年，曾引起极大注意，但技术尚未达到战前的水平。半把式比战前是增加了四十七个、新带徒弟七十三个，正在逐渐提高中。
    时已届冬，正是皮毛业劳动一年出售成品的季节，本市出售皮货的门市部和摊子共有十家，各色各样的皮货应有尽有。今年制出的主要成品中，大小皮袄的各占一半。目前一般的价格，大致如下：（每件计）二毛皮袄新币九百至一千元，老皮袄六百元，大黑皮袄四百五到五百，皮裤二百，狐皮袄最好的二千八百到三千元，一般的二千元左右，西口皮袄（二毛）二千二百元，狐皮大领二百至二百二十元。（魏玉明、齐东昌、牛来全）
