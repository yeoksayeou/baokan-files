    Workers and Citizens Actively Assist the Government
    Xuanhua's Order is Being Restored
    [PingSui Frontline Telegraph] With the active assistance of workers, order in Xuanhua is being rapidly restored. The People's Liberation Army implemented military control in the city the day after its recapture (the 8th). Zhi Shengyuan, director of the political department of a certain unit, served as the director of the Military Control Commission. On the 9th, propaganda teams appeared on the streets, reuniting with the people they had been separated from for so long. Workers, staff, and students all complained that when the Chiang bandits retreated on the 6th, they forced them to leave factories and schools and move materials, but they refused. At the Longyan Iron Mine in Yantong Mountain, not a single employee ran away. They protected the factory, machinery, and materials, waiting for our army to take over Xuanhua. Employees of the post office protected their furniture and awaited instructions. Employees of the power plant negotiated with the Xiayuan Power Plant to restore power. Workers at the Xuanhua City Telecommunications Bureau are repairing the city's lines and the lines to Xiayuan and Shaling stations. The original chairman of the Chamber of Commerce ran away, so the merchants organized a new Chamber of Commerce. Teachers and staff of various schools are actively gathering students to prepare to resume classes. Amidst the booming sounds of the siege of Zhangjiakou, the people are building their own Xuanhua.

　　工人市民积极协助政府
    宣化秩序正恢复中
    【平绥前线电】在工人积极援助下，宣化秩序正在迅速恢复中。解放军于该城收复次日（八日）实行军事管制，某部政治部主任智生元任军事管制委员会主任。九日，宣传队出现街头，与久别之人民重会。工人、职员、学生纷纷控诉蒋匪六日撤退时，曾强迫他们离开工厂、学校，搬走物资，但被他们拒绝了。烟筒山龙烟铁矿，原有员工一个也没跑，保护工厂、机器、物资等候我军接收宣化，邮政局员工，把家具保护好等候处理；发电所的员工，到下花园发电厂交涉通电问题。宣化城电讯局的工人正修理市内及通往下花园、沙岭车站的路线。原商会会长跑了，商人们又组织了新商会。各校教职员正积极召集学生，准备复课。在围攻张家口的隆隆响声中，人民正在建设自己的宣化。
