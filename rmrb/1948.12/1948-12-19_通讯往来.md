To All Branches:

　　The Taihang Branch sent in a report on the land reform and party rectification situation since autumn, which is very good. This is of great help to us in understanding the work situation in various places. All other branches can also write one and send it in.
    Shijiazhuang Branch:
    Since the branch meeting, you have only sent a few news reports about the anniversary of the liberation of Shijiazhuang. Readers from all over have written and telegraphed requesting reports on the situation in Shijiazhuang in order to exchange experiences. You should resume sending稿immediately and report on various situations in Shijiazhuang in a planned manner.
    Jilu豫 Branch:
    The report on Yanggu County abolishing the exchange and allowing private establishments of stores is a new issue. However, the specific advantages and disadvantages of the exchange and private stores, why private stores have such great benefits, and the relationship between the government and private stores are not specifically written out or are unclear. Please quickly supplement on the above points.

　　通讯往来各分社：
    太行分社发来秋季以来土改整党情况，很好，这对我们了解各地工作面貌有很大帮助。其他各分社均可撰写一篇发来。石家庄分社：
    自分社会议以来，你们除发了石市解放周年报导几篇通讯外，至今即无报导。各地读者纷纷来信、来电要求报导石市状况，以便交流经验，你们应立即恢复发稿，有计划地报导石市各种状况。冀鲁豫分社：
    阳谷县取消交易所，允许私人成立行店的报导是新问题。但交易所与私人行店有什么具体利弊，为什么私人行店有那样大的好处，政府对私人行店的关系如何，都未具体写出或不清楚。请就以上诸点迅速补充。
