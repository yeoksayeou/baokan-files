　　Eagerly Awaiting the PLA to Liberate Beiping and Tianjin
  　The Bitter Life of the People in the Beiping-Tianjin Area Under the Rule of the Bandit Fu
    "The Chiang bandits get fat, the people get thin, who will rescue the people?" "The People's Liberation Army is coming soon, Chiang Kai-shek is about to collapse!" "Hoping for the stars, hoping for the moon, hoping the People's Liberation Army comes quickly; hoping for the moon, hoping for the stars, hoping the People's Liberation Army will strike Tianjin." This is a folk song from western Tianjin, circulating in the Beiping-Tianjin area ravaged by the Chiang-Fu bandit gang, and it is a manifestation of the local people's desire for liberation.

    The people of the Beiping-Tianjin area are suffering in a living hell under the bestial acts of rape, murder, looting, and conscription by the Chiang-Fu bandit gang. In the past year alone, according to extremely incomplete statistics, the Fu bandits have conscripted more than 20,000 men in the Beiping-Tianjin-Baoding triangle area, killed more than 1,000 people, and looted countless amounts.

    (1) In the Daxing County area near Beiping, the Chiang-Fu bandits have "recruited" five times this year, from the ages of eighteen to forty-five. If there are three brothers, two are taken; if there are two, one is taken. If you don't go, you have to pay thirty piculs of millet to buy a replacement. This is still considered "lenient"! The Fu bandits' police teams and conscript teams arbitrarily arrest people in various villages. After they are caught, they are sold to other villages. This kind of catching and selling has left the people destitute. In July, the enemy used insidious methods such as "blocking doors at night," "entering villages on stilts," and "searching the fields" to conscript. In the two villages of Dongxi Yadi alone, thirty-one people were taken away. In October, the enemy demanded four soldiers from each village and each Jia in the area. If a village could not deliver, the village chief would be detained and the "soldier's family" would be killed. It was extremely vicious.

    The cruelty of the Fu bandits' murder and rape is appalling. Once, the enemy's "Anti-Traitor Section" (i.e., secret service) in Yufa, Daxing County, received an order from above to "obtain materials" and, without any reason, arrested Zhao, a deaf man in his seventies who ran a cart shop in Daxinzhuang, and a kidnapper named Song, accusing them of "being in contact with the Eighth Route Army" and killed them. "Searching for the Eighth Route Army" became an excuse for the bandit army to arbitrarily rape women in the villages, going to people's homes to "search for the Eighth Route Army," shouting as soon as they entered the door, "Where are your daughters and daughters-in-law? Come out quickly." Once, after raping a woman surnamed Zhou in Nangezhuang Village, the bandit army also stole the bracelet she was wearing. Li's pregnant wife in the city was also driven into the wild and raped by the Fu bandit army.

    Looting is an even more common tactic of the Chiang-Fu bandits. In Nangezhuang Village, Daxing County, the enemy once looted seventy cartloads of clothing, bedding, and grain. Ruishinghao Grocery Store in the village had ten piculs of grain stolen, and all the wine was drunk.

    In addition, the enemy often forces people to do hard labor, hitting and fining them at will while they are working. The Fu bandit army at Wanzhuang Station demanded laborers from various villages. If a village did not send them, they were forced to pay thirty catties of wheat per day. Nanwu, a small village of fifteen households, sent some children because they really did not have enough manpower. The enemy was dissatisfied and made the children kneel under the hot June sun, without even letting them eat.

    In March, the Chiang-Fu bandits built bunkers in Hankou, Zhongtang, and other places near Tianjin. In July and August, they dug up rivers and released water, flooding crops that were about to be harvested. In these nearly seven months, each village was extorted up to 100 catties of corn per mu. Gongjiabao has eighty households and about fifty hectares of land. Each mu usually yields two or three dou of grain. This year, the Fu bandits forcibly requisitioned 10,000 catties of wheat during the wheat harvest and another 500 piculs of autumn grain. This does not include the extra extortions. For example, 120 million (enemy currency) was extorted during the Mid-Autumn Festival, not to mention the occasional taxes and "entertainment fees." The people of southern Tianjin, who have always lived in poverty, are now destitute under the extortion of the Chiang-Fu bandits. Here, people cannot do business, no matter how small. Even if they can sell something for money, they will eventually be extorted and lose money, or even their lives. The enemy has set up checkpoints on the roads to charge people passing by. Ships running to Tianjin have to pay the pseudo-major township 20 million at a time as "maintenance fees." The "Kuaima" and "Huaxing" merchant ships were detained for more than a month because they had no money. A ship selling basins from Shengfang was beaten to death because they did not pay the fee.

    The citizens of Tianjin, under the bloody rule of the Chiang-Fu bandits, are already in a serious famine. The starving citizens unanimously hope that the People's Liberation Army will attack Tianjin. As a result of the Kuomintang government's "price limits" and "rations," business in Tianjin has become impossible, grain cannot be bought, and paper money is becoming increasingly worthless. Many merchants have goods but dare not sell them. When the Chiang family police went to Dexingcheng Noodle Shop in Dayingmen to buy noodles, they said "no," and then completely looted all the noodles and forcibly sealed the door. A certain soap factory used to have hundreds of workers and staff, but due to excessive taxes and levies, its business has gradually shrunk, and now only a few people are left. To wait for rations, many citizens gather at the granary doors every day, often waiting from morning to night, but they cannot buy even a grain of rice, and finally return empty-handed. Zhao Chunlai, a pier worker from Sunjiatai, Dazhigu, Hedong, had his four-year-old child starve to death. A certain household, because they had nothing to eat, committed suicide by jumping into the Haihe River at Dahongqiao with their entire family of six. Zhang Siyu, who fled back to Jinghai County from Tianjin, personally saw thousands of people crowded in front of a noodle shop in Tianjin, waiting for "rations," and a twelve or thirteen-year-old girl was trampled to death. After the Chiang army, which was defeated in the Northeast, fled to Tianjin, they robbed restaurants and stole food everywhere, causing even more chaos in the market. The Dengyun Food Store was eaten clean by the Chiang army, and the shopkeeper was beaten up.

    The citizens of Tianjin know that the days of suffering are coming to an end, and the People's Liberation Army will soon come to liberate them. One day, a newspaper boy shouted in the street: "Good news! Good news!" Upon closer inspection, it turned out to be news that the Kuomintang in Changchun, Jinzhou, and Shenyang in the Northeast had "voluntarily withdrawn." The newspaper sold particularly quickly that day. An old man who had just arrived from Changchun secretly told his confidant friends in Tianjin: "When Changchun was liberated, I was still there. Once the People's Liberation Army entered, life was no longer difficult. I think Chiang Kai-shek in Tianjin is like Changchun, it's about to be over!"

### 热盼解放军解放平津　傅匪统治下平津地区人民生活苦况

　　热盼解放军解放平津
  　傅匪统治下平津地区人民生活苦况
    “蒋匪肥，百姓瘦，谁把百姓来搭救？”“解放军快来喽，蒋介石快要拆台喽！”“盼星星，盼月亮，盼着解放军来的快当；盼月亮，盼星星，盼着解放军打天津。”这是津西的民谣，传流在蒋傅匪蹂躏下的平津地区，是当地人民渴望解放心情的流露。
    平津地区的人民，在蒋傅匪帮奸淫、屠杀、抢掠、抓丁的兽行遭害下，简直是生活在人间地狱里，在近一年内，据极不完全统计，傅匪在平津保三角地区，抓丁两万以上，杀人千名以上，抢掠难以数计。
    （一）在北平近郊的大兴县一带，蒋傅匪今年即“征兵”五次，从十八岁到四十五岁，弟兄三个的去两个，两个的去一个，不去就拿三十石棒子买兵，这还是“宽容”！傅匪的保警队、壮丁队，任意到各村抓人，抓来后卖给各村，就这样抓来卖去，闹腾的老百姓人财两空。七月间，敌人更用“夜间堵门”，“拂跷进村”，“下地搜索”等阴险办法进行抓丁。单东西押堤两村，就被抓走三十一个。十月间，敌人又在该地每村每甲要兵四个，哪村交不上，就扣保长，“杀兵户”，狠毒至极。
    傅匪屠杀、奸淫的残忍，是令人闻之发指的。一次，该县榆垡敌“除奸科”（按即特务）接到上级“要材料”的命令，无故就把大辛庄一个开大车铺、七十多岁的赵聋子和一个姓宋的拐子扣上“通八路”的罪名杀死。“查八路”成了匪军到村任意强奸妇女的借口，随便到各家“查八路”，进门就喊：“你们家里那闺女媳妇哩？赶快出来。”一次匪军在南各庄村北强奸周某的儿媳后，还把手上带的镯子抢走了。该城李某的妻子怀了孕，也被傅匪军赶到野外强奸了。
    抢掠，更是蒋傅匪的惯技。该县南各庄村，一次被敌抢去衣被粮食七十大车。该村瑞生号杂货铺，就被抢走十石粮食，酒被喝光。
    此外，敌人常常要人去做苦工，做工时说打就打，愿罚就罚。万庄车站的傅匪军向各村要夫，哪村不去就叫拿三十斤麦子顶一天工。十五户的小村南务因为实在没有人力，派了些儿童去，敌人不满，就叫小孩在六月火热的太阳底下跪着，饭也不叫吃。
    三月里，蒋傅匪在天津近郊的汉口、中塘等地修上了碉堡。七八月里，又扒河放水，淹没了快收到手的庄稼。这近七个月的功夫，各村被勒索每亩达玉米一百斤。宫家堡有八十户人家，约五十顷地，每亩常年打二、三斗粮食，今年麦季傅匪却强征小麦一万斤，秋粮又征五百石。这还不算，额外的勒索更多。如八月节被勒索一亿二千万（敌币），零星的苛税、“应酬费”还不在内。素来生活贫困的津南人民，在蒋傅匪的敲诈勒索下，现在简直是一贫如洗了。这里人们的买卖，不论大小都不能做，就是能卖点钱，最后也要被勒索赔本，甚至丧了命。河路口敌人都设上卡子，过人就要花钱，跑天津的船给伪大乡的“维持费”一次要两千万。“快马”、“花兴”两商船，因没钱就被扣了一个多月。胜芳卖盆的船，因没花钱，人被打死了。
    在蒋傅匪血腥统治下的天津市民，已处在严重的大粮荒中，饥饿中的广大市民，一致盼望解放军去打天津。由于国民党政府“限价”、“配给”的结果，天津的买卖已不能做，粮食也买不到，票子一天比一天不顶用，很多商户有货也不敢卖。大营门德兴成面铺，在蒋家警察去买面时，说了个“没有”，就把所有的面完全抢光，并且强给封了门。某肥皂工厂，过去有工人职员百十个，因苛杂勒索太重，营业日渐缩小，现在只剩下几个人。为等配给粮，每天有很多市民挤在粮栈门口，往往从早等到晚，一点米也买不到，最后落个空手而回。河东大直沽孙家台七保码头庥人赵春来，他四岁的孩子活活被饿死。某户市民因没的吃，全家六口在大洪桥跳河自尽。静海县从天津逃回来的张四玉，在天津市亲眼见到上千的人挤在一个面铺门前，等着“配给”，竟把一个十二三岁的女孩子踩死了。在东北溃散的蒋军逃到天津后，到处抢饭铺，抢东西吃，闹的市面上更加混乱。登云食品店，被蒋军吃光，掌柜还挨了一顿打。
    天津的市民们知道受苦的日子快到头了，解放军不久就要来解放他们。一天，卖报的小孩在街上大喊：“好消息！好消息呀！”上前一看，原来是写着东北长春、锦州、沈阳国民党“主动撤离”的消息。这天报纸卖的特别快。一个刚从长春来的老头，秘密告诉天津的知己朋友说：“长春解放时，我还在哩，解放军一进去，生活就不困难了；我看蒋介石在天津，也象长春一样，快完蛋了！”
