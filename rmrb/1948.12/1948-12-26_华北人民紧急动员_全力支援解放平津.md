　　North China People's Emergency Mobilization
    All-Out Support for the Liberation of Tianjin and Beiping
    [Our Newspaper] To support the North China and Northeast China People's Liberation Army in completing the historical mission of liberating Tianjin and Beiping and liberating all of North China, all parts of the North China Liberated Area are urgently mobilizing to provide all-out support to the front lines. A large number of civilian laborers and militiamen who have been fighting with the army on the Beining and Ping綏 lines for three months, along with carts, mules, and stretchers, will continue to automatically follow the army in combat to complete the task of liberating Tianjin and Beiping, and their morale is extremely high. Currently, a logistics headquarters has been established in Central Hebei to systematically continue mobilizing all rear transport forces to complete the transportation of ammunition and various supplies. After completing the first batch of ammunition transportation before December 15th, the second batch will begin soon. Thirty-two bridges of various sizes in the entire area began to be repaired at the beginning of the month, and five were completed by the 8th, and all will be completed by the 20th. Southern Hebei District will also mobilize a large number of militiamen and civilian laborers to participate in the Beiping-Tianjin Campaign, and logistics departments in various places are working tensely and happily. The North China Logistics Headquarters has established a collective office system to improve work efficiency and overcome all delays and procrastination; it has also instructed logistics departments at all levels to establish a night shift system to ensure timely completion of work. Various formal work systems have been rapidly established, and superiors and subordinates guarantee daily reports and contact. The investigation and reporting of seized items is also faster than before. According to the person in charge of the Military Region Logistics Headquarters, the investigation report of seized items after the liberation of Zhuolu was submitted within six days, and some materials were reported within two days after the liberation of Liulihe. All rear agencies are working hard to support the Beiping-Tianjin Campaign. A certain hospital in Hebei-Shandong-Henan, after marching for more than ten days to participate in the Beiping-Tianjin Campaign, is still in high spirits and has now rushed to the front line to participate in rescue work. Various places in Central Hebei and Northern Yue have also called on and mobilized students and local doctors to participate in nursing work. The post office has established mobile post offices along with the front-line logistics departments to facilitate rapid contact with the rear and with the outside world in the liberated cities.
