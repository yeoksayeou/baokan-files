(Jizhong Electric) The Jizhong Administrative Office, based on the current needs of the developing situation and the basic principles of the North China People's Government regarding culture and education, has formulated a draft implementation plan for restoring and rectifying national education, proceeding from the specific conditions in Jizhong. After overcoming certain "leftist" deviations in education that once existed in some areas, as well as the tendency to neglect education, the region's education work has achieved considerable success. Currently, the region has 11,423 primary and secondary school teachers, 7,190 junior primary schools with 443,964 students, and 613 senior primary schools with 57,181 students. In total, there are 501,145 primary and secondary school students (with girls accounting for 31.3 percent), representing over 68 percent of the region's school-age children. However, there are still some pressing issues that need to be resolved. The Administrative Office's education conference re-emphasized the education policy based on the situation and proposed the following implementation principles: (1) Primary schools must emphasize cultural education, with junior primary schools focusing on literacy and classroom learning. Daily schedules must be established, classes must be held on time, and required courses must be completed on schedule. Social activities should be reduced. To accommodate family production needs, students can be granted leave and make-up classes. Learning times can be changed during busy farming seasons, but the necessary coursework should be completed. (2) To prevent children from dropping out of school due to a lack of family labor, afternoon classes, night classes, or "attend-as-you-can" classes should be established. These classes should be given the same importance as regular primary schools. If manpower is insufficient, additional teachers can be hired, or semi-volunteer teachers from the village can be recruited to help. (3) Primary school courses should begin in the spring, and the total class time per year should not be less than 36 weeks, with vacations not exceeding 12 weeks. Strict testing, promotion, graduation, and enrollment systems should be established. The conference also decided that the period until June of next year would be for the restoration and rectification of national education. Implementation plans were developed based on the different conditions in various regions. In areas with a better education foundation, schools should become more standardized and improve quality. In areas with a weaker foundation, in addition to restoring existing primary schools, primary schools should be appropriately increased to achieve one school per village. Appropriate measures should be taken for primary schools in border areas, cities, and disaster areas based on specific circumstances. To complete the above plan, governments at all levels should strengthen their leadership over education, educational cadres should be fully equipped, and education sections should establish their own departmental business systems. The living and working conditions of teachers must also be addressed.

　　冀中行署制订方案
    恢复整顿国民教育
    【冀中电】冀中行署根据目前形势发展的需要，及华北人民政府关于文化教育的基本方针，从冀中具体情况出发订出了恢复与整顿国民教育实施办法草案。该区经过克服某些地方曾一度存在的教育中的左的偏向，以及忽视教育的倾向后，教育工作获得不少成绩。现在全区有高初小教师一万一千四百廿三名，初小七千一百九十所，学生四十四万三千九百六十四名；高小六百一十三处，学生五万七千一百八十一名。总计高初小学生五十万一千一百四十五人（女生占百分之三十一点三）。占全区学龄儿童百分之六十八以上。但目前仍存在一些问题急待解决。行署教育会议根据情况重新阐明教育方针，并提出实施原则：（一）小学必须重视文化教育，初小注意识字，重视课堂学习。必须制订日课表按时上课，按期完成必修课程。减少社会活动，为了照顾家庭生产，对学生可建立请假补课制度，农忙节季可改变学习时间，但应完成必要课程的学习。（二）为使家庭劳力缺乏的儿童不致失学，应设午学班、夜班或随到随学。此种班次应与正规小学同等重视，如人力不及可增聘教员一人或聘村中半义务教员帮助。（三）小学课程之进行为春季始业，全年上课时间不得少于三十六周，放假不得超过十二周。建立严格的测验、升级、毕业、招生制度等。会议并决定至明年六月以前为国民教育之恢复与整顿时间。并根据几种不同情况之地区分别作出实施计划，教育基础较好地区，学校要走向正规并提高质量；基础较差地区除恢复原有小学外，要适当增设小学，使一般村庄达到一村一校；边沿区、城市及灾区小学按具体情况作出适当办法。为完成上述计划，各级政府应加强对教育之领导，教育干部要配备齐全，教育科应建立本部门业务制度。教员生活及工作问题，亦须注意解决。
