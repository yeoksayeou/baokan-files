　　Kuomintang Bandit Gang Colludes with British Imperialists
　　To Murder Overseas Chinese in Malaya
　　【Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 28th】After suffering a shameful defeat in the barbaric colonial war waged by British imperialism in Malaya for the past six months, it is now adopting extremely brutal scorched-earth tactics against the Malayan people, and with the help of Kuomintang secret agents, is wantonly persecuting our overseas Chinese. According to a report by the Electric News Agency: Unable to eliminate the Malayan People's Army in combat, the British reactionaries and their running dogs, in a fit of rage, have burned down hundreds of villages and arrested thousands of farmers in their "scorched earth" campaign. They are attempting to starve the People's Army and intimidate the people who support the People's Army. Several huge concentration camps are filled with innocent farmers and their families who have been arrested. Workers and trade union leaders are also subject to assassination and arrest by the authorities. According to a report published by British Colonial Office personnel in November: there are currently seven thousand trade unionists imprisoned in Malaya.
　　According to officials of the Malayan Federation: from June to November this year, a total of 4,428 foreigners were detained under the "emergency measures," the vast majority of whom were overseas Chinese. It is reported that many of these arrested overseas Chinese were arrested based on blacklists provided by Kuomintang secret agents in Malaya. When MacDonald flew to Nanjing in June to hold secret talks with bandit chieftain Chiang Kai-shek, MacDonald made this request. Recently, the British and Chiang have been conspiring to massacre these overseas Chinese. According to a report by the Electric News Agency: British Colonial Secretary Jones has recently decided to deport a large number of overseas Chinese. A reporter for the London Times reported on the 7th of this month: another group of democrats has been deported, and deportations will continue. Many of these democrats are certain to be killed because they will be handed over to Kuomintang police as "red elements." The Electric News Agency also stated: Dozens of innocent people are being denounced and made unable to live, or even deprived of their lives, for the sole "crime" that they are Chinese and live in guerrilla areas.

　　国民党匪帮勾结英帝
  　谋杀马来亚侨胞
    【新华社陕北二十八日电】英帝国主义半年来在马来亚进行的野蛮殖民地战争，遭受可耻的失败之后，正对马来亚人民采取极残暴的烧杀手段，并在国民党特务的帮助下，恣意迫害我国侨胞。据电通社报导：由于无法在作战中消灭马来亚人民军队而老羞成怒的英国反动派及其走狗，已在“焦土战”中放火焚毁了成百的村庄，逮捕了成千的农夫。他们企图借此饿死人民军队与恫吓拥护人民军队的人民。若干巨大的集中营内，塞满了被捕的无辜农民及其家属。工人与工会领袖亦受到当局的暗杀与逮捕。据英殖民部人员十一月发表的报告称：目前在马来亚有七千个工会人员被开在监狱中。
    另据马来联邦官方透露：自今年六月至十一月中间，在“紧急措施”下被扣押的外侨，共达四千四百二十八人，其中绝大部分是华侨。据悉：这些被捕的华侨，很多是依照国民党在马来亚的特务所开具的黑名单逮捕的。当六月间麦克唐纳飞赴南京与匪首蒋介石密谈时，麦氏曾提出此种要求。最近，英蒋又在共谋屠杀这些华侨。据电通社报导：英殖民大臣琼斯最近已决定大批放逐华侨出境。伦敦泰唔士报记者本月七日报导称：又有一批民主人士被放逐出境，并将续有放逐。这些民主人士中，许多人是必然被杀死的，因为他们将被作为“赤色分子”移交给国民党警察。电通社又称：数十名无辜人民，其所以被检举并被弄得无法生活甚至被剥夺生命，唯一的“罪名”是因为他们是中国人并居住在游击区内。
