　　Marching Towards Victory!
　　Wang Nan
　　The People's Liberation Army's powerful and magnificent ranks, passing through Zijing Pass, victoriously march towards Chahar and the Ping-Sui Railway. The front has just passed, and the rear follows closely, day and night without stopping. The highway winds along the mountain gully, climbing to the mountain pass. The troops are like a giant torrent, following the highway, passing through the pass, and crossing the deeply shining Yongding River. At the foot of the mountain opposite, a member of the propaganda team, disguised as Fu Zuoyi, stands to one side in a green uniform, looking worried. Two propagandists point at him and say, "Fu Zuoyi won't live long, like dew meeting the sun!" The passing soldiers loudly reply, "Soon, soon! Quickly send this bad guy to his death!" In the dust, the voice of a loudspeaker is heard from the front: "Comrades, keep moving! The Northeast Army has entered the pass, let's cooperate with the Northeast Army to take revenge on Fu Zuoyi and settle old scores!" As soon as the broadcast stops, a voice asks the troops: "Will we avenge Zhangjiakou?" The troops reply in unison: "Yes!" "Will we settle the two-year-old scores?" "Yes!" The mountains echo: "Avenge, settle..." The questioning voice continues: "Revenge! Settle accounts! Keep moving! It'll be too late if you don't hurry!" The troops are like fire fueled with oil, moving upwards even faster. The higher they go, the more slogans there are on both sides: "Advance on Ping, Tianjin, and Zhang, annihilate the Chiang-Fu bandits!" "Take revenge on Fu Zuoyi!" "Annihilate the North China Chiang bandits, don't let one escape!" These slogans encourage the entire army to march towards victory. Zhen Zongchuang, the deputy company commander of a certain unit's 7th Company, carries two bedrolls, a submachine gun, and two rifles on his back, sweating as he moves upwards. Yan Guiying, who is ill, also insists on moving upwards, saying: "The entire 7th Company hasn't fallen behind, I won't ruin the 7th Company's glory!" On both sides of the cliffs on the top of Zijing Pass Mountain, a large cloth is hung, on which is written "Glory Upon Glory." In front of the horizontal banner, red characters on yellow paper are pasted on the high mountain cliffs, two slogans with foot-square characters: "Annihilate Fu Zuoyi!" "Liberate all of North China!" To the left of the horizontal banner, gongs and drums are being played intensely. Several propagandists on the left sing: "Every revolutionary soldier must remember, the Three Main Rules of Discipline and the Eight Points for Attention!" The magnificent troops march northwards along the highway below the horizontal banner. Songs, the sound of gongs and drums, and shouts are interwoven into one, and the atmosphere of victory and joy makes the mountains vibrate with life. Everywhere is filled with the will to win, filled with the determination for revenge! The troops pass through Zijing Pass, cross the Yongding River, move against the Ping-Sui Railway, point to Zhangjiakou, and advance towards victory with swift and orderly steps!

　　向胜利挺进！
    王楠
    解放军强大雄伟的队伍，通过紫荆关，向着察哈尔，向着平绥路胜利挺进，前面的刚刚过去，后面的又接着上来，昼夜不停；公路沿着山沟弯曲的爬上了山顶的关口，队伍象一支巨流，顺着公路、穿过关口，越过深光闪闪的永定河。在对面山脚下，宣传队里一个人化装了傅作义，穿着一种绿衣服，愁眉苦眼的立在一边，两个宣传员指着他说：“傅作义活不长，好比露水见太阳！”经过的战士们就高声的答着：“快了，快了，快送这坏家伙的命了！”在尘土中前面传过来广播筒的声音：“同志们，加油走呀，东北大军入关了，配合东北大军向傅作义报仇算老帐呀！”广播声刚一停，队伍被一个声音发问：“张家口的仇报不报？”队伍齐声的同答：“报！”“两年老帐算不算？”“算！”山语也起了回声：“报、算………”问的声音更问了：“报仇的、算帐的、加油呀！晚了就摸不上了！”队伍象火上加了油一样，更快的向上去，愈向上走，两方标语愈多：“挺进平、津、张，歼灭蒋傅匪！”“向傅作义报仇！”“歼灭华北蒋匪，不让一个漏网！”这些口号鼓舞着全军向胜利挺进。某部七连副连长甄宗床，背着两个被包、一挺冲锋枪和两支步枪，流着汗向上走，阎贵英有病，也坚持着向上走，他说：“七连整个没掉队，我不破坏七连的光荣！”紫荆关大山顶上的两边山崖上，挂起一条大布，上写着“光荣上面加光荣”，横联前边高山崖石上贴着红字黄纸，一尺见方大字的两条标语：“歼灭傅作义”，“解放全华北！”横联左边锣鼓紧张的打着，左边的几个宣传员唱着：“革命军人个个要牢记，三大纪律八项注意！”雄伟的队伍从横联下面的公路上向着北方走过去，歌声、锣鼓声、呼喊声，交合成一片，胜利与愉快的气氛，把山都震荡的活泼起来了，到处充满了胜利的意志，充满了复仇的决心！队伍穿过紫荆关，路过永定河，逆着平绥路，指着张家口，向着胜利，步伐迅速而齐整的前进！
