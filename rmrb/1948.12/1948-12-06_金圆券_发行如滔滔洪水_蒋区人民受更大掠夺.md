Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 3rd: Tianjin newspapers report: The Kuomintang government is desperately increasing the issuance of large-denomination Gold Yuan notes. Fifty-yuan and one-hundred-yuan Gold Yuan notes (equivalent to 150 million and 300 million old legal tender dollars respectively) were released on November 15th. Previously, the "Gold Yuan Issuance Measures" only stipulated five denominations, but now a new twenty-yuan denomination Gold Yuan note has been added, circulating in the market simultaneously with the fifty-yuan and one-hundred-yuan denominations. Various sources reveal: the actual amount of fake Gold Yuan issued has long exceeded the original limit of two billion yuan set on November 8th. The "Revised Gold Yuan Issuance Measures," which removed the issuance limit, is in fact to obtain a "legal" basis for the further expansion of the Gold Yuan. According to a Tianjin Yi Shi Bao report on the 17th of last month: Liu Gongyun, Deputy Governor of the Kuomintang Central Bank, once claimed that the bank's inventory of gold and silver "is sufficient to recover 12 billion Gold Yuan." This statement is just like what the fake Finance Minister Wang Yunwu said on August 19th during the "currency reform," that only 200 million US dollars would be needed to recover all the legal tender. It is completely a deception of the people in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, and its purpose is to create an excuse for the expansion of the Gold Yuan. Newspapers in the Kuomintang-controlled areas now describe the issuance of Gold Yuan as a "raging flood." The Tianjin Ta Kung Pao admitted: The Gold Yuan is no different from the legal tender. In the past, the saying that "the Gold Yuan is a disguised large denomination note" was denounced as "rumor-mongering," but now it has become an undeniable fact.

　　“金圆券”发行如滔滔洪水
  　蒋区人民受更大掠夺
    【新华社陕北三日电】天津报纸消息：国民党政府正在拼命增发金圆券大钞。五十元和一百元票面的金圆券（折合旧法币为一亿五千万元一张与三亿元一张）已于十一月十五日出笼。过去“金圆券发行办法”中只规定五种票面，现在则又增发一种二十元票面的金圆券，与五十元、一百元票面金圆券同时流行市面。各方消息披露：伪金圆发行额早已溢出原来规定的二十亿元的十一月八日的限额。“修正金圆券发行办法”，将发行限额取消，事实上就是为了金圆券进一步膨胀取得“合法”的根据。据上月十七日天津益世报消息：国民党中央银行副总裁刘攻芸曾扬言该行库存金银“可够收回金圆券一百二十亿之用”。这段话与八月十九日“币改”时伪财长王云五所说，只须二亿美金即可将全部法币收回一样，完全是一种对国民党区人民的哄骗，其目的就是为金圆券的膨胀制造借口。国民党统治区报纸现在都形容金圆券的发行象“滔滔洪水”。天津大公报承认：金圆券与法币已无何差异，过去“金圆是变相的大钞”一说被斥为“造谣”，现在则已成为无可置辩的事实了。
