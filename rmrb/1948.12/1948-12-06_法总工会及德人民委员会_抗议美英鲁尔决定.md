　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 1st. Radiotelegraph Agency reported: The French General Confederation of Labor issued a statement on November 25, protesting the U.S.-British decision to return the Ruhr to Nazi capitalists. The General Confederation of Labor stated that the decision is "a direct threat to French security and world peace." The statement emphasized that the General Confederation of Labor's protest "is also directed at the French government, because the French government's policy of abandoning national interests and currying favor with U.S. imperialism has enabled the U.S. and British governments to make this decision." The French Communist Party's newspaper "L'Humanité" revealed in an editorial on the 25th the hypocrisy of the French government's so-called "memorandum" to the U.S. and Britain, stating that if France's memorandum on the Ruhr stemmed from a genuine concern for French interests, it should have emphasized that the U.S. and Britain's handover of the Ruhr armaments factories to German Nazi capitalists is a fatal threat to France. But the memorandum directs attention to the fact that the United States merely intends to leave the issue of Ruhr industrial ownership to the future German government. L'Humanité continued, history has proven that all attempts to rearm France with the steel produced by the Ruhr magnates, such as the Western European Union defense plan, are disarming France and leaving it open to aggression. L'Humanité concluded that if the French government is willing to do anything beyond mere propaganda, it should propose a four-power solution to the Ruhr issue. But French capitalists are uneasy about the U.S.-British decision only because they fear that others will take away a bone from them. In any case, French capitalists would not want a genuine international control that would allow the Soviet Union to participate in resolving the German issue.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 30th. The plan of the American military authorities to return the Ruhr to its former owners has aroused widespread protests among the German people. TASS Berlin, 26th: The Presidium of the German People's Council issued a statement expressing anger at the intention of the U.S. military authorities to return Ruhr industry to its former owners, that is, to hand over the German coal and iron center to the German industrial capitalists who funded Hitler in preparing for World War II and bear the primary responsibility for the chaos and hunger in Europe. The Presidium of the German People's Council strongly protested this plan and demanded the implementation of the decision of the North Rhine-Westphalia State Parliament to nationalize the coal mining industry. The Presidium of the German People's Council called on all democratic parties and organizations in Germany to oppose the plan of the U.S. military authorities and strive to turn Ruhr industry into the public property of the German people.

  　抗议美英鲁尔决定
    【新华社陕北一日电】电通社讯：法国总工会十一月二十五日发表声明，对美英决定将鲁尔交还纳粹资本家一事提出抗议。总工会声明指出：该项决定是“对法国安全及世界和平的直接威胁”。声明强调宣称，总工会的抗议“同样也是对法国政府提出的，由于法国政府执行放弃民族利益和趋奉美帝国主义的政策，才使得美英政府作出了这一决定”。法共机关报“人道报”二十五日社论揭露法国政府对美英提出其所谓“备忘录”的虚伪性称：如果法国关于鲁尔的备忘录是出于对法国利益的真诚关切，它就应该是强调指出美英将鲁尔兵工厂交还德国纳粹资本家是对法国的致命威胁。但该备忘录却把注意力引向于美国只是要把解决鲁尔工矿所有权问题留交未来的德国政府。人道报继称，历史已经证明，用鲁尔大资本家们生产的钢铁来重整法国武装的一切尝试，例如西欧联盟防卫计划，都是使法国解除武装听任侵略的。人道报结语指出，如果法国政府愿意做任何超过纯粹宣传性的事情，它就应提出以四强解决鲁尔问题为目的的建议。但法国资本家对美英决定感到不安，只是因为他们害怕人家夺去自己的一根骨头。无论如何，法国资本家们都不会愿意有一个使苏联也能够参与解决德国问题的真正的国际管制的。
    【新华社陕北三十日电】美国军事当局将鲁尔交还其旧日所有主的计划，在德国人民中间激起了广泛的抗议。塔斯社柏林二十六日讯：德国人民委员会主席团特发表声明，对美国军事当局之打算将鲁尔工业交还其旧日的所有主，亦即将德国煤铁中心交给资助希特勒准备第二次世界大战、并应对欧洲的混乱与饥饿负主要责任的德国大工业资本家，表示愤怒。德国人民委员会主席团强烈抗议这一计划，要求实施北莱茵威斯特伐利亚州议会的煤矿工业国有化的决定。德国人民委员会主席团号召德国一切民主党派与团体反对美国军事当局的计划，力争把鲁尔工业变成德国人民公共的财产。
