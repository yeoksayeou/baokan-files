Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, December 20th: TASS Berlin, December 16th: The Economic Commission under the German People's Council held a meeting in Berlin. Yarop, Director of the International and Foreign Trade Control Bureau of the Commission, reviewed the development of foreign trade between East and West Germany at the meeting, stating that West Germany's foreign trade is conducted in accordance with the interests of American monopoly capitalists. Coal and raw material exports account for 90 percent of West Germany's exports. However, manufactured goods are imported into West Germany, even though the West German joint occupation zones are capable of producing these things themselves. In contrast, East Germany's trade is built on a solid foundation. Compared with 1947, East German exports have increased fourfold this year. They will double again next year. It is worth pointing out that East Germany is exporting manufactured goods and importing raw materials and grain. Next year, grain imports will increase fourfold, while coal and iron imports will decrease, because East Germany's coal and iron production will greatly increase. Yarop further pointed out that East Germany's main trading partner is the Soviet Union, which can purchase large quantities of East German manufactured goods. Another country that plays an important role in East Germany's foreign trade is Poland. In 1949 and 1950, the trade volume between Poland and East Germany will be equal to its previous trade volume with the entire Germany. East Germany's trade with Western European countries is also rising, but it is hampered by the United Kingdom and the United States, who prohibit the transportation of goods through the western occupation zones. Therefore, Western countries are causing damage not only to the eastern occupation zone but also to the interests of the entire Germany. After listening to Yarop's report, the Economic Commission passed a resolution congratulating the East German Soviet occupation zone's foreign trade agencies for concluding trade agreements with almost all European countries.

　　东德对外输出较去年增四倍
    【新华社陕北二十日电】塔斯社柏林十六日讯：德国人民委员会所属之经济委员会在柏林举行会议。该会国际及对外贸易管制局局长亚洛普在会上检讨东德与西德对外贸易发展的情况称：西德的对外贸易系按照美国垄断资本家的利益进行的。煤炭和原料出口占西德出口的百分之九十。然而，制成品却被输入西德，虽然西德联合占领区是能够自己生产这些东西的。与此相反，东德的贸易却建立在坚实的基础上。与一九四七年比较，今年东德对外输出已增加四倍。明年将再增加一倍。值得指出的是，东德是输出制成品而输入原料和粮食。明年，粮食的输入要增加四倍，而煤和铁的输入则要减少，因为东德煤铁的生产将大大增加。亚洛普进而指出，东德在贸易方面的主要交往者是苏联，苏联能够购买东德大量的制成品。在东德对外贸易中占重要地位的另一个国家是波兰。在一九四九和一九五○年，波兰与东德间的贸易量将等于它以前与整个德国的贸易量。东德与西欧国家的贸易也在上升，但受到英美的阻碍，他们禁止通过西部占领区运输货物。因此，西方国家不仅对东部占领区而且对整个德国的利益造成损害。经济委员会听取亚洛普之报告后通过决议，祝贺东德苏占区对外贸易机构几乎与欧洲一切国家缔结了贸易协定。
