Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, December 2nd: The enthusiastic participation of the broad masses of liberated people in the Northeast in the war over the past three years has been one of the important foundations for the People's Liberation Army to achieve great victories and liberate the entire Northeast. According to incomplete statistics from the Northeast People's Government Committee, in addition to performing sporadic support duties in the rear, various regions directly sent more than 1.33 million laborers to serve on the front lines in coordination with this campaign, along with more than 174,600 stretchers, more than 123,600 carts, and more than 467,400 horses (the above figures do not include the Jehol-Chahar-Liaoning area). This powerful force emerged on the basis of land reform. Before the start of each campaign, local labor and stretcher teams were prepared. After the start of the autumn offensive last year in Xi'an County, Liaobei Province, farmers in various places rushed to buy large cattle, sold old carts and replaced them with new ones, and every family competed to participate in the war. In Xifeng County, when mobilizing laborers in two districts, more than 1,000 people signed up in one day and night, and some areas even organized reserve labor companies, platoons, and squads to be ready to set off at any time. Before the laborers set off, grand send-off meetings were held in various places. At the meetings, the laborers expressed their determination and set strict discipline and various rules. Local people and governments guaranteed to help take care of the family life of the participating laborers. After the laborers gathered in various places, they formed participating teams according to their respective tasks. The general organization was very substantial and the equipment was quite complete. Each county established a brigade by district, a company by village, and a team below the village level. Each team and group was led by politically conscious leaders and deputy leaders. Some long-distance participating teams were personally led by the county committee of the Communist Party, and party member militia played a key role in them. According to preliminary statistics from Nenjiang Province, a total of 244 county-level and district-level cadres and more than 550 village-level cadres took the lead in participating in the war in the past two years. Each participating team had organizations such as veterinarians, medical clinics, cultural and educational committees, discipline inspection groups, and merit evaluation committees. Many stretcher teams had anti-aircraft and rescue equipment. During last winter's offensive, some teams used cold-proof ambulances, reducing the suffering of the wounded in the severe cold of minus 30 degrees Celsius.

After arriving at the front, the laborers showed great courage. Whenever the battle began, they would enter the designated locations in an organized manner to carry out various transfer tasks, and some would voluntarily participate in front-line rescue, rushing into the hail of bullets and shrapnel and risking their lives to rescue the wounded. During last year's autumn offensive, a stretcher team in Nenjiang Province followed the troops for more than 1,000 li, participated in front-line rescue more than 100 times, and gloriously completed its merit-making plan. A labor team in Heilongjiang Province, during the Shenyang North battle last winter, not only safely transferred the wounded, but also cooperated with the troops to capture more than 40 prisoners and seized two large carts of American weapons. The laborers often helped the troops lead the way, scout, and disguise for air defense during marches. In the transfer of the wounded, they spared no effort to feed the wounded tea and meals, and kept watch day and night, showing meticulous care. During the intervals between battles, in addition to organizing their own studies, they also promoted the policies of the people's government and various constructions in the old liberated areas to the masses in the new areas in batches, so that the relationship between the military and civilians in the驻地 was very harmonious, and the influence of our army was expanded. After the start of last year's autumn offensive, the participating teams in various parts of northern Manchuria followed the army into the southern section of the China Changchun Railway and along the Beining Railway. Under the frantic strafing of enemy planes, they devised all means to safely transfer the wounded and materials during the day. Wherever they went, they quickly carried out resident work, which promoted the mass movement in the new areas.

Due to the laborers' active responsibility and care for the wounded, they were also loved and cared for by the army during the war. The army often sent instructors to give them reports, and the leaders of the troops also took good care of their lives. When they encountered difficulties, the soldiers often worked with them to find ways to overcome them. After each campaign, the troops held military-civilian get-togethers and labor merit-recording conferences, and the military and civilians carried out enthusiastic self-criticism and mutual encouragement. Many participating team members were awarded and commended under democratic evaluation. According to incomplete statistics, in the past two years, more than 100 laborers in various provinces in northern Manchuria have been awarded and commended for their personal participation in the war. On the way back to their hometowns after completing their tasks, the participating teams were warmly welcomed by the people along the way with gongs and drums.

　　解放全东北重要基础之一：
    三年来广大翻身人民　直接参战者达百余万
    【新华社哈尔滨二日电】过去三年中，东北广大翻身人民的热烈参战，是解放军取得伟大胜利、解放全东北的重要基础之一。据东北政委会不完全统计，各地人民除担任后方零星支差勤务外，为配合这个战役，直接参加前线服务的有民工一百三十余万人，担架十七万四千六百余付，大车十二万三千六百余辆，马四十六万七千四百余匹（上述数字不包括冀察热辽地区）。这一支雄厚的力量，是在土地改革的基础上涌现的。在每一战役开始前，各地的民工担架队即准备妥当。辽北省西安县各地农民在去年秋季攻势开始后，即纷纷买进大牛，卖去旧车换进新车，家家争相参战。西丰县两个区在动员民工时，一昼夜即有千余人报名，有的地区并组织民工预备连、排、班，以便随时出发。民工出发前，各地均举行盛大的欢送会。会上民工纷纷表示决心，并定出严格的纪律及各种守则。当地人民及政府则保证帮助照顾参战民工们的家庭生活。各地民工集结后，均按照任务分别组成参战队。一般编制均甚充实，配备亦颇完善。每县以区设大队，村设中队，村以下设小组。各队各组均由政治觉悟较高的正副队长、组长领导。有的远征参战队由中共县委亲自率领，党员民兵则在其中起骨干作用。据嫩江省初步统计，两年来参加参战队的县级、区级干部共二百四十四名，村级干部带头参战者有五百五十余名。各参战队中，有兽医、医务所、文教委员会、纪律检查组及评功委员会等组织。许多担架队多有防空、救护的装备。去年冬季攻势中，有些队曾使用防寒的救护车，使伤员们在零下三十余度严寒中减少了痛苦。
    民工们到达前方后，均表现十分英勇。每当战斗开始时，他们即有组织地进入预定地点，担任各种转运工作，有的并自动参与火线救护，出入枪林弹雨、奋不顾身地抢救伤员。去年秋季攻势中，嫩江省一个担架队曾跟随部队行动千余里，参加火线救护百余次，光荣地完成了自己的立功计划。黑龙江一个民工队在去冬沈（阳）北战斗中，除安全转运伤员外，并配合部队捉得俘虏四十余名，缴获美国武器两大车。民工们在行军中常常帮助部队带路、侦察及伪装防空。在转运伤员中不辞一切劳苦，替伤员喂茶喂饭，昼夜看守，体贴备至。他们在战斗间隙，除自己组织学习外，并分批向新区群众宣传，讲解人民政府的政策和老解放区的各种建设等，使驻地军民间的关系甚为融洽，扩大了我军的影响。去年秋季攻势开始后，北满各地的参战队随军进入中长路南段及北宁路沿线各地，在敌机疯狂扫射下，他们想出了一切办法使伤员及物资在白天中得以安全转运。他们每到一地，即迅速开展居民工作，对新区的群众运动起了推动的作用。
    由于民工们的积极负责，爱护伤员，所以在参战中，他们也受到军队的爱护和关心。军队经常派指导员给他们作报告，部队首长对他们的生活也很照顾。遇到困难时，战士们常常和他们共同设法克服。当每个战役结束后，各部队多召开军民联欢会及民工记功大会，军民双方展开热烈的自我检讨及互相勉励，许多参战队员并于民主评定下荣获记功。据不完全统计，过去两年中，北满各省民工在直接参战中个人受奖及记功者即有百余人。各参战队于公毕返乡途中，受到沿途人民敲锣打鼓的热烈欢迎。
