[Taihang Telegram] Because the preparatory work before entering the city was not sufficient, some of the restoration work after the liberation of Jixian County was slow and failed to meet the requirements of the majority of citizens. After review, the municipal democratic government is working hard to remedy this shortcoming, first of all by vigorously regulating the economy to solve the serious harm caused by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit currency to merchants and citizens, so that the city's market will move towards prosperity. (Editor's note: First of all, we must pay attention to solving the difficulties of workers, staff, and middle and lower-level citizens.) The lessons they have learned in entering the city are: (1) Financial problems should be solved quickly to prosper the market. Most of the industrial and commercial businesses in the city resumed normal operations two hours after liberation, but soon the market became depressed again. The main reason was that the currency exchange rate was not announced in time after liberation, the prices of materials were not introduced in time, and the currency reserves were not sufficient. Banks and trade companies did not enter the city until three days after liberation, so the exchange of materials was not open, and the Hebei-Chahar-Rehe Border Region currency could not be circulated quickly. (2) Cadres entering the city should have sufficient preparations in advance, organize training to study urban policies, and should clearly divide labor and determine various receiving personnel and receiving methods. The convening of various meetings for pacifying the people and restoring order should also determine their responsible persons and specific content in advance. This time, when entering Jixian City, the above-mentioned matters were not fully prepared, resulting in a lack of cadres and methods for various receiving work, and the restoration work was somewhat passive. (3) Sufficient books, newspapers, propaganda materials and other cultural nourishment should be prepared in advance. Before entering the city, bookstores and post offices should be organized well. As soon as they enter the city, newspapers should be quickly distributed, bookstores should be opened, and propaganda materials should be distributed everywhere, quickly creating a new atmosphere, which is of great importance to the establishment of urban democratic order. After the liberation of Jixian County this time, the citizens generally reflected that there were too few propaganda materials, and intellectuals and young students also felt that they could not see progressive books and newspapers. They all urgently requested to concretely understand our party's various policies and the victorious situation of the War of Liberation today, and we should quickly find ways to meet them.

　　汲县检讨入城工作事先须有充分准备
    【太行电】由于入城前准备工作做得不够充分，汲县城解放后的某些恢复工作进行迟缓，未能满足广大市民的要求。经过检讨，该市民主政府正在努力补救这一缺点，首先大力调剂经济设法解决蒋匪币所给予商人市民的严重遗害，使该市市场走向繁荣。（编者按：首先必须注意解决工人、职员、中小层市民的困难。）他们在入城工作上取得的教训是：（一）应迅速的解决金融问题以繁荣市场。该市在解放两点钟后，大部工商业即照常营业，但不久市场又呈萧条，主要原因，是由于解放后未及时宣布货币收兑比值，物资价格没及时介绍，货币准备亦不充足。银行与贸易公司在解放后三天才陆续进城，因此物资交流不开，冀钞不能很快通行。（二）入城干部事前应有充分准备，组织训练学习城市政策，并应明确分工，确定各种接管人员及接管办法。各种安民恢复等会议的召开，事先亦应确定其负责人和具体内容。此次进入汲县市，上述事项均未准备充足，致使各种接管工作缺乏干部与办法，恢复工作有些被动。（三）事先应准备充足的书报、宣传品等文化食粮。入城前即应把书店、邮政局组织好、一进城即迅速发行报纸，开书店，到处散发宣传品，很快造成新的空气，这对城市民主秩序建立有重大作用，此次汲县解放后，市民普遍反映宣传品太少，知识分子、青年学生亦感觉看不到进步书报，他们均迫切要求具体了解我党各种政策与今天解放战争的胜利形势，应迅速设法予以满足。
