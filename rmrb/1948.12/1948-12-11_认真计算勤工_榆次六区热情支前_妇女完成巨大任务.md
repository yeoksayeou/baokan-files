    Conscientiously Calculate Work Points
    Yuci Sixth District Enthusiastically Supports the Front
    Women Complete Huge Tasks
    [Jinzhong Electric] In order to promote continued support for the front and completely eliminate the Yan bandit gang, the Yuci Sixth District convened a meeting of district cadres on November 20th to review the work of supporting the front and summarize experiences. The district has a total of twenty administrative villages, with two thousand two hundred and thirty-three men aged sixteen to fifty-five, and two thousand seven hundred and fifty-four women. Under the slogan of "March on Taiyuan, Capture Yan Xishan Alive!", they have successively completed the task of transporting a large amount of equipment to the front lines. Women throughout the district ground 214,500 jin of flour for the troops, washed and sewed 11,400 pieces of clothing, and women and children delivered 110,000 jin of straw. There are often 360 service laborers at the front lines. After October 24th, the number of civilian laborers sent by the entire district accounted for eight percent of the men aged sixteen to fifty-five. This task was successfully completed by the women and children remaining in the villages at a time when the autumn harvest and the handing over of public grain were underway. The main experiences for the district’s ability to complete such arduous and great tasks are as follows: (1) Conscientiously and promptly settle work points. This work is being done for the first time in the new district, and special attention should be paid to being reasonable and fair in order to lay a good foundation. The district adopted the serious method of providing rice for those who did not work, so that a few cunning people could not take advantage of it, and they also actively demanded to participate in the war. (2) Recalling past suffering and arousing strong hatred for the Yan bandits. When discussing participation in the war in various villages in the district, a movement to pour out grievances and seek revenge against the Yan bandits was launched. When the masses recalled the disasters that the Yan bandits had caused them in the past, they said one after another, "This time we will not go home until Taiyuan is captured," changing from coping with errands to actively participating in the war. Shi Chouwang of Nanzhuang recalled the suffering he had endured at the hands of the Yan bandits. When pushing firewood to Luoyang, others pushed 200 jin at a time, but he pushed 400 jin. (3) Helping the families of the civilian laborers participating in the war with production and taking care of their living difficulties, so that the civilian laborers at the front can participate in the war with peace of mind. Many civilian laborers at the front became more active in their work when they heard that the autumn harvest and wheat sowing at home had not been delayed. (4) Distinguishing between good and bad, praising when praise is due, and criticizing when criticism is due. A civilian laborer from Xifan Village won a prize banner during participation in the war, and since then he has always striven to complete various tasks ahead of others. The masses elected him as a model. He said, "In the past (referring to the Yan bandit era), honest people suffered losses. Now everyone has elected me as a model. In the future, I will work harder to participate in the war and completely liberate myself." In the summaries of each village, a total of 45 district models and 45 village models were selected. Under the leadership of the models in each village, the masses participated in the war more consciously, and could launch mass criticism against lazy people, so that everyone's enthusiasm was improved. (5) Cadres set an example, raising the enthusiasm of the masses to participate in the war. When the civilian laborers in our district made a sudden attack to transport equipment this time, district cadres Bai Jinde, Bi Jiulin, Bi Quanwang, Chen Sanniu, and Liu Dianxuan all carried equipment with the civilian laborers. The masses said, "The Liberation Army cadres are so good! They are still working, how can we not work hard?"

    认真计算勤工
    榆次六区热情支前
    妇女完成巨大任务
    【晋中电】为了推动继续支前，彻底消灭阎匪，榆次六区于十一月二十日召开区干部会议，检查支前工作，总结经验。该区共行政村二十个，十六至五十五岁的男人二千二百三十三人，妇女二千七百五十四人。在“打到太原去、活捉阎锡山”的口号下，先后完成向前线运送大量器材的任务。全区妇女给驻军磨面二十一万四千五百斤，洗缝衣服一万一千四百件，妇女儿童送草十一万斤。常在前线的战勤民工有三百六十名。十月二十四日以后，全区出民工占十六至五十五岁男人的百分之八。这时正在秋收和碾交公粮的时候，这一任务由留在村中的妇女儿童顺利地完成。该区所以能完成这样艰巨伟大的任务，主要经验有以下几点：（一）认真地及时清算勤工。这一工作在新区是初做，应特别注意合理公道，以求打下好的基础。该区采取不出工就出米的认真办法，使少数乖巧人不能占便宜，也都积极要求参战。（二）回忆以往痛苦，激发对阎匪的强烈仇恨。该区各村讨论参战时，展开对阎匪诉苦复仇运动，群众想起过去阎匪对自己的灾害，纷纷表示：“这次参战，非打下太原不回家”，从应付支差变成了积极参战。南庄史丑旺想起受过阎匪的痛苦，往洛阳推劈柴时，别人一次推二百斤，他推四百斤。（三）帮助参战民工家庭生产，照顾其生活困难，使前方民工放心参战。许多民工在前方一听说家里收秋种麦没误了，工作就更加积极。（四）好坏分清，该表扬就表扬，该批评就批评。西范村一个民工在参战中得了奖旗一面，以后在各项工作上无不争先完成，群众选他为模范。他说：“以前（指阎匪时代）是老实人吃亏，现在大家选我当模范，今后我要更努力去参战，彻底解放自己。”在各村总结中，共选出区模范四十五人，村模范四十五人。在各村模范带头下，群众参战更加自觉，对偷懒分子能展开群众性的批评，使大家积极性都提高。（五）干部以身作则，提高群众参战情绪。这次我区民工突击转运器材时，区干部白进德、毕九林、毕全旺、陈三牛、刘殿选五同志都和民工在一块抬运器材。群众说：“解放军干部就是好！人家还干，咱还能不好好干？”
