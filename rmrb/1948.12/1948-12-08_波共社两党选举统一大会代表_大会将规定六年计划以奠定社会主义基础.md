Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 6th: Warsaw dispatch: Organizations of the Polish Workers' Party and the Socialist Party throughout Poland have been enthusiastically electing delegates to attend the unification congress of the two parties scheduled for the 8th of this month. On November 28th, the General Secretary of the Workers' Party and President of the Republic, Bolesław Bierut, and the General Secretary of the Socialist Party and Prime Minister of the Republic, Józef Cyrankiewicz, were respectively elected as delegates of the two parties. The Minister of Industry and Commerce, Hilary Minc, the Minister of Public Security, Stanisław Radkiewicz, and the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Zygmunt Modzelewski, have also been elected as delegates by local Workers' Party organizations. When speaking in Wrocław, Minc announced that Poland's industrial production has now exceeded this year's plan and will exceed the original plan by 10% by the end of the year. Most of the war wounds have been healed, and most of the wasteland has been sown. Minc pointed out that it is the Polish Workers' Party that is guiding the country's reconstruction. He also declared that the unified congress will stipulate the outline of Poland's six-year construction plan to lay the foundation for socialism. The Secretary of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party, Zambrowski, declared in Lodz that the average production and consumption of the people have now exceeded the pre-war level, which shows that the economic system led by the working masses is superior to the pre-war capitalist system.
    In order to welcome this unified congress, Polish workers have launched a huge wave of labor enthusiasm. Polish coal miners were the first to put forward this call, and workers in various industries immediately responded enthusiastically. Steel workers completed this year's annual plan six weeks ahead of schedule on November 18. Workers in the textile, petroleum, and tobacco industries have also completed their annual plans. As of November 22, the silk weaving industry had completed 99.7% of the plan. Workers who have completed the plan are now striving for more excess production as a gift to the unified congress of the two parties.

　　波共社两党选举统一大会代表
    大会将规定六年计划以奠定社会主义基础
    【新华社陕北六日电】华沙消息：波兰全国各地工人党与社会党的组织，连日热烈选举各该党出席订于本月八日举行的两党统一代表大会的代表。上月二十八日，工人党总书记、共和国总统贝鲁特，社会党总书记、共和国总理西伦凯维兹，已分别当选为两党代表。工商部长明兹，公安部长拉德凯维兹与外交部长摩塞莱夫斯基，亦已分别由各地工人党组织选为代表。明兹在罗克劳演说时宣布：波兰工业生产现在已经超过了本年的计划，到年底时将超过原计划的百分之十。大部分的战争创伤已经消除，大部的荒地已播种。明兹指出：指导国家重建工作的是波兰工人党。他又宣告：统一的代表大会将规定波兰建设六年计划的大纲，以奠定社会主义的基础。工人党中央委员会书记赞布洛夫斯基在罗兹宣称：人民的平均生产与消费现在都已超过战前水平，这说明劳动大众领导的经济制度优越于战前的资本主义制度。
    为迎接这个统一代表大会波兰工人已掀起巨大的劳动热潮。波兰煤矿工人首先提出这一号召，各业工人继即热烈响应。钢铁工人在十一月十八日提前六个星期完成了本年的全年计划。纺织、石油、烟草业工人，亦已完成全年计划。至十一月二十二日，丝织业已完成计划百分之九十九点七。已完成计划的工人，现在正努力争取更多超额的生产，作为给两党统一代表大会的礼物。
