　　“Correcting Even a Single Wrong Classification is a Must”
  　Puyang County Decides to Carefully Revise Class Designations
　　[Our Newspaper News] The Puyang County Committee of the 9th Sub-district of Hebei-Shandong-Henan, in an enlarged cadre meeting of the whole county, following the spirit of Comrade Ren Bishi's report that "correcting even a single wrong classification is a must," examined the work of class designation and revision of class status. In the past two months, the whole county, while rectifying policies and concluding the land reform, has paid attention to correcting wrongly designated statuses and has carried out appropriate compensation and resettlement. However, in a considerable number of villages, class designations are still very chaotic. According to statistics from 22 villages in the second and third districts, a total of 39 households were wrongly classified, including 8 households of middle peasants classified as landlords and rich peasants, 1 household of rich peasant classified as landlord, 11 households of landlords classified as rich peasants, 10 households of rich peasants classified as middle peasants, and 9 households whose statuses are still questionable. In Hongmiao of the first district, among the six landlord and nine rich peasant households, five landlord households had actually participated in labor since 1942, and three rich peasant households had stopped exploitation. In Sun Liuhuang Village of the fifth district, six rich peasant households had stopped exploitation for five years, but none of them had been given a change in status. In terms of the method of class designation, it was generally studied internally within the branch, but after the study, it was rarely submitted to the masses for full discussion, and rarely or never with the participation of the individuals themselves. Therefore, it was inevitable that some bad people took advantage of loopholes, and the evils of protectionism, sectarianism, etc., emerged in large numbers, seriously affecting the implementation of policies. In addition, some landlords, rich peasants, and bad elements took the opportunity to spread rumors and create trouble, causing some poor peasants to have very volatile emotions and voluntarily move out of the houses that had been distributed to them. The main reason for these deviations is that there is insufficient understanding of the meaning and purpose of class designation, and the Party's policies have not been resolutely implemented. Some think "it doesn't matter"; some only require "designating the households that are being struggled against, so that the masses can understand a boundary," without fully mobilizing the masses to discuss, forming cadre control. Secondly, many cadres are confused about the time limit for changing the status of middle and rich peasants; they cannot clearly grasp it. Therefore, the county party committee decided that in this winter's party rectification, ending land reform, and rectifying the mass ranks, we will continue to correct wrongly designated statuses and must not neglect it in the slightest.

### “划错一个人也必须改正”　濮县决定慎重改订成份

　　“划错一个人也必须改正”
  　濮县决定慎重改订成份
    【本报讯】冀鲁豫九分区濮县县委在全县扩大干部会议上按着任弼时同志报告中“划错了一个人也必须改正”的精神，检查了划分阶级与改订成份的工作。两月来全县在端正政策结束土改中，虽注意了改正错订成份，并进行了适当的补偿安置，但在相当一部分村庄阶级还划的很乱，据二、三区二十二个村庄统计，共错划了三十九户，其中把中农划为地富者八户，富农划为地主者一户，地主划为富农者十一户，富农划为中农者十户，尚有九户成份可疑。一区的红庙的六户地主九户富农中，实际从一九四二年便已有五户地主参加了劳动，三户富农停止了剥削。五区的孙刘黄庄六户富农已停止剥削五年，可是都没有给人家改变成份。在划分阶级的方式上，一般多是支部内部研究，但在研究后大都没有交由群众充分讨论，很少或者没有经过本人参加，因此不可免的被某些坏人钻了空子，包庇、宗派等弊病百出，严重影响了政策的执行。再加某些地富坏分子乘机造谣生事，以致有些贫农情绪波动很大，自动的从已分配的房子搬出来。检讨发生这些偏向的主要原因是对划分阶级的意义与目的认识不足，没有坚决执行党的政策，有些认为“没有什么”；有些仅要求“划一划被斗户，叫群众了解一个界线”，没充分的发动群众讨论，形成了干部包办。其次是中富改变成份期限许多干部迷糊；不能明确掌握。因此县委决定，在今冬进行整党、结束土改、整顿群众队伍中，继续改正错订成份，绝不能稍加忽视。　　　　　　　　　　（夫）
