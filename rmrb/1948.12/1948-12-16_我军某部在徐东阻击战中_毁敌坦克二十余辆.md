Xinhua News Agency, Huaihai Front, 14th -- In the blocking action against the enemy's Qiu Qingquan and Li Mi corps east of Xuzhou last month, a unit of the People's Liberation Army destroyed more than twenty enemy tanks in one night on the 6th. On November 11th, a regiment of the unit destroyed two enemy tanks in the battle of Sishankou. On the 12th, the unit conducted military democracy at various positions, studying anti-tank tactics and techniques. Various artillerymen actively participated in anti-tank groups. Demolition heroes each led a group to form a defensive line at the forefront of the position. On the morning of the 14th, the enemy, with 23 tanks in a single file, advanced towards Mazhuang and Yaozhuang on the north side of the Longhai Railway. When they entered the range, our artillerymen launched a fierce attack, hitting the two leading tanks. At this time, all our commanders, fighters, and support personnel jumped out of their fortifications, picked up anti-tank grenades seized from the enemy, and rushed into the tank group. Wang Fuming, the leader of the 6th machine gun squad, rushed to an enemy tank and destroyed it with six concentrated shots. Rocket launcher Zhang Zi rushed head-on to a position 200 meters in front of five enemy tanks and destroyed one with a single shot. Then Zhang Hongyi and other artillerymen from our 7th squad rushed to a position 100 meters in front of the tanks, firing fiercely and forcing all the tanks to flee in panic. On the same day, the enemy, with nine tanks covering a regiment, sneaked to Houzhuang on the south side of the Tongpi Highway. We first attacked with firepower, followed by rocket launcher Dong Hualin, who bravely launched an attack and continuously fired between the tank groups with skilled movements, destroying two enemy tanks. On the 14th, a platoon of our army blocked the attack of eight enemy tanks. After a one-hour standoff, the first two enemy tanks turned to the left to outflank. Wang Jingtang and Shao Qingting, warriors of our 3rd squad, rushed forward and completely burned them with incendiary bombs and grenades, and the remaining tanks fled in a hurry. On the 15th, the enemy, with seven tanks covering two companies, attacked a position of our regiment and had one destroyed by our forces. On the 16th, the enemy again advanced to the west of Zhengji with eight tanks covering a regiment, forming small groups of three to charge. When the first three tanks rushed to the front of our position, rocket launcher Cheng Fangting hit all three with three shots, destroying them all. Then the artillerymen destroyed two enemy tanks with long-range fire. In total, within six days and nights, a unit of the People's Liberation Army destroyed more than twenty enemy tanks in the area east of Xuzhou, along the two sides of the Longhai Railway, from Taishan and Weizhuang in the south to Huzhuang on the north bank of the Bulao River, over a distance of thirty li.
