　　Xiaopeng Village Farmers
  　Unite and Concede to Resolve Land Disputes
    [This Newspaper's Report] He Jin Cai, a village cadre in Xiaopeng Village, Sixth District, Jin County, Hebei-Chahar-Jehol, found the registration group with an old land deed when registering land and issuing land certificates, saying, "My land and Peng Laogao's land adjoin each other, and the description doesn't match the documents, so it needs to be re-measured." The registration group notified Peng Laogao to go and measure the land together. The measurement result showed that according to He Jincai's document, Peng Laogao had planted seven zhang more; according to Peng Laogao's document, He Jincai had planted eight chi more. Both of them had old land deeds. After the land was measured, they both looked at the land deed documents and had nothing to say. The registration group asked them what to do about this matter? Peng Laogao was stunned for a while and could not come up with a solution. He Jincai said, "Both of our families have old land deeds, and the measurement results are incorrect. You decide what to do!" The registration group explained the spirit of unity and mutual concession, explaining that the old documents can be used as a basis, but cannot be completely relied upon, because their documents all have problems, it is better to register according to the current planting acreage, and anyone who has an opinion can raise it for further discussion. He Jincai said, "Now I understand the acreage. It turns out that there was a problem with the old documents." Peng Laogao said, "I used to think you were planting more of my land, but after this measurement, I realized that the acreage in the document was wrong. We are all old neighbors, so let's just register it clearly, there's nothing to say." The two of them discussed and resolved years of land disputes. (Hebei-Chahar-Jehol Daily)

　　小彭村农民
  　团结互让解决土地纠纷
    【本报讯】冀中晋县六区小彭村何进才，是个村干部，在登记土地发土地证时，拿着旧红契找到登记组说：“我和彭老告是顶头地，与文书不符，得重新丈量。”登记组通知彭老告就伴去量地，丈量结果，按何进才文书上的地亩数，彭老告多种七丈地；按彭老告文书上的地亩数，何进才多种着八尺。俩人都是拿着老红契，量完地后，都看了看红契文书没有话说。登记组问他们这事怎么办？彭老告呆了会没有说出什么办法来，何进才说：“俺两家都是老红契，丈量结果都不对，你们看着办吧！”登记组给他们解释了团结互让的精神，说明旧文书可以作根据，但不能完全依靠它，因为他们的文书都有毛病，不如按照现种地亩数登记，谁有意见还可以提出来再讨论。何进才说：“这回才弄清地亩数了，原来旧文书有毛病。”彭老告说：“以前我净估计你多种着我的地，这一丈量才明白了，是文书上亩数不对。咱们都是老乡亲，登记清就算了，没有什么说的。”俩人商商量量解决了多年的土地纠纷。（冀中导报）
