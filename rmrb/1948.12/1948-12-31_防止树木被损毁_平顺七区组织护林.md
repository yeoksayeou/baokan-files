　　Preventing Damage to Trees
　　Pingshun Seventh District Organizes Forest Protection
    [Taihang News] In the past, Pingshun Seventh District planted many trees every year, but most of them were not cared for, and many were gnawed to death or eaten by cattle and sheep. Some were frozen to death, or damaged by children. In order to eliminate this phenomenon, the District Office specifically instructed all villages in the district on December 10th: A forest protection committee of five to seven people should be established with the village head and production director as members, absorbing cattle and sheep worker representatives who love forest trees and people enthusiastic about forest protection work, to be responsible for forest protection work. Explain to farmers that it is a waste of effort to only plant trees without protecting them. After group discussions among the farmers, everyone unanimously agreed. All villages organized forest protection groups of old men, women, and children, dividing the work to pile stones around the trees. Some villages prohibited grazing cattle and sheep on forest slopes, and smeared the roadside saplings with cow dung to prevent cattle and sheep from gnawing. Those that were afraid of freezing to death were wrapped in grass. Within three days, all twenty-one administrative villages in the district smeared more than 11,000 trees, piled stones around more than 7,000 trees, and wrapped more than 5,000 trees.

　　防止树木被损毁
  　平顺七区组织护林
    【太行讯】平顺七区过去每年植树不少，但大部不加爱护，被牛羊啃死或被吃掉不少，也有的被冻死，或被儿童损坏。区公所为杜绝此种现象，特于十二月十日指示全区各村：以村长、生产主任为委员，吸收爱护林木的牛羊工代表和热心护林工作的人，成立五至七人的护林委员会，负责护林工作。向农民说明光造林不护林是白费力。经过农民分组讨论，大家都一致同意。各村都组织了老汉、妇女、儿童成立护林小组，分工用石头垒树。有的村禁止林坡放牛羊，并分别将路边小树用牛粪抹上，防止牛羊啃。怕冻死的，则用草裹住。全区二十一个行政村，三日内共抹一万一千余棵，垒挡七千余棵，裹五千余棵。
