　　US Imperialism and Its Lackeys
  　Write Down Their Crimes of Undermining the UN General Assembly
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, December 17th: In the third United Nations General Assembly, which lasted 83 days from September 21st, the representatives of the Soviet Union and the New Democracies thoroughly exposed the aggressive face of the US-British bloc, asserted the propositions of the world's broad masses of people, and won a political and moral victory. The US-British bloc and the "majority" countries it manipulated wrote down a shameful record of undermining peace, destroying the United Nations, and rudely interfering in the internal affairs of other countries.
    The most important proposal in this conference was the Soviet proposal to ban atomic weapons and for the five major powers to disarm by one-third within the next year. After nearly two months of discussion, the "majority" controlled by the US-British bloc, which pursued a policy of aggression in the middle of the conference, rejected this proposal representing the will of peace-loving people, and on November 19th passed the Belgian proposal which actually opposed disarmament. Other reactionary proposals passed by the General Assembly include: the November 4th proposal to base the international control of atomic energy program on the US "Baruch Plan"; the November 27th proposal to extend the "Balkan Committee" for one year; the December 4th proposal to extend the "Little General Assembly" for one year; the December 8th proposal requesting the Security Council to abolish the principle of great power unanimity regarding the admission of new members; the December 12th proposal to establish a Palestine Conciliation Commission and allow the Commission to act freely (i.e., to allow the US and Britain to freely undermine last November's UN General Assembly partition resolution); and the December 12th proposal to recognize the South Korean Syngman Rhee puppet government as the sole legitimate government of Korea and to re-establish the Korean Commission. The Soviet Union and the New Democratic countries voted against all the above reactionary proposals submitted by the Political and Security Committee to the General Assembly. Only the Mexican proposal calling on the major powers to restore peace efforts was unanimously passed by the General Assembly on November 3rd. In addition, the General Assembly also passed some proposals submitted by the other five committees. The proposal by the Trusteeship Committee requesting the Union of South Africa to place South West Africa under UN trusteeship was passed by a large majority of the General Assembly on November 26th. The General Assembly also passed four proposals by the Financial and Economic Committee regarding the economic development of backward areas, the establishment of a Middle East Economic Commission, technical assistance for economic development, and the training of technicians. The first two proposals were unanimously passed by the General Assembly on December 4th, while the Soviet Union and the New Democratic countries abstained from voting on the latter two. Regarding the so-called "Declaration of Human Rights" put forward by the Social and Humanitarian Committee, although the Soviet Union and the New Democratic countries supported some of the clauses, because the spirit of the declaration was clearly to cover up the truth of the oppression of millions of people in capitalist countries and to support the reactionary "theory" against national sovereignty, they all abstained from voting when the General Assembly passed the declaration on December 10th. The Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, proposed by the Legal Committee, was passed by a large majority on December 9th. The budget of more than 43 million US dollars for various UN agencies in 1949, proposed by the Budget Committee, was passed by the General Assembly on the last day, with the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries abstaining.

　　美帝及其走卒们
  　写下破坏联大的罪状
    【新华社陕北十七日电】在从九月二十一日开始的历时八十三天的第三届联合国大会中，苏联和新民主各国代表彻底地揭露了美英集团的侵略面貌，伸张了世界广大人民的主张，赢得了政治上道义上的胜利。美英集团及其操纵下的“多数”国家，则写下了它们破坏和平、破坏联合国和粗野地干涉他国内政的可耻纪录。
    这次大会中最重要的提案，是苏联所提的禁止原子武器及五强今后一年内裁军三分之一的建议。经过近两个月的讨论，大会中间执侵略政策的美英集团控制的“多数”，否决了这一代表渴望和平的人民意志的议案，而于十一月十九日通过比利时所提实际上反对裁军的议案。大会通过的其他反动议案，计有十一月四日的以美国“巴鲁区计划”为国际管制原子能计划基础的议案，十一月廿七日的延长“巴尔干委员会”一年的议案，十二月四日的延长“小型联大”一年的议案，十二月八日的要求安理会关于新会员入会取消大国一致原则的议案，十二月十二日的建立巴勒斯坦调解委员会并允许委员会自由行动（即允许美英自由破坏去年十一月的联大分治决议）的议案，及十二月十二日的承认南朝鲜李承晚伪政府为朝鲜唯一合法政府及重设朝鲜委员会的议案。所有上述经过政治安全委员会向大会提出的反动议案，苏联及新民主国家均投反对票，仅墨西哥所提吁请各大国恢复和平努力一案，于十一月三日为大会一致通过。除此之外，大会还通过了其他五个委员会提出的一些议案。托管委员会提出的要求南非联邦应将西南非交由联合国托管的议案，于十一月廿六日为大会绝大多数通过。大会并通过了财经委员会提出的开发落后区经济、建立中东经济委员会、关于经济发展的技术援助与关于训练技工的四个提案，前二案在十二月四日大会表决中获一致通过，后二案表决时，苏联及新民主国家弃权。社会人道委员会提出的所谓“人权宣言”，苏联及新民主国家虽然支持其中的一些条款，但由于该宣言的精神显然在于掩盖资本主义国家千百万人受压迫的真象，并支持反动的反对国家主权的“理论”，故在十二月十日大会通过该宣言时，均弃权未投票。法律委员会提出的禁止集体残杀公约，于十二月九日以绝大多数通过。预算委员会提出的联合国各种机构一九四九年度四千三百余万美元的预算，于最后一日为大会通过，苏联及人民民主国家弃权。
