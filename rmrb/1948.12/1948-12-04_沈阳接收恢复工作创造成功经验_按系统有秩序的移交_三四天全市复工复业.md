Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Shenyang's reception and recovery work is an important and successful experience. This largest city in Northeast China, with a population of over one million, completely restored its electricity, telephone, running water, post office, telegraph, tram, and railway transportation within just three to four days after liberation. Factories resumed operations one after another, shops reopened, prices stabilized, and order was maintained. The people expressed admiration for the rapid restoration.

A notable characteristic of Shenyang's reception and recovery work is that the city's people promptly and spontaneously maintained public order and protected public property. Another characteristic is that most of the responsible personnel from the original Kuomintang organs remained at their posts and implemented an orderly handover. This is the result of the people across the country abandoning the Kuomintang reactionaries and leaning towards the Chinese Communist Party, and it is the result of the Chinese Communist Party's correct urban policy influencing people's hearts. The experience of Shenyang sets a good example for the people in the large cities still ruled by the Kuomintang, and for the civil servants in the Kuomintang's military, political, financial, economic, cultural, and educational organs. Many of them are still worried about what to do when the Kuomintang army has already collapsed and the People's Liberation Army has not yet entered the city, and what to do after the People's Liberation Army enters the city. They can learn useful lessons from the experience of Shenyang.

When the People's Liberation Army approached the Dongling and Beiling suburbs and the enemy fell into chaos, the advanced elements among the people of Shenyang actively carried out various city protection tasks. Slogans such as "Welcome the People's Liberation Army" and "Welcome the Communist Party" appeared in various streets and squares. Groups of industrial workers, students, and office workers spontaneously organized themselves to guard public property day and night, braving the flying bullets. They said, "We have finally waited for this!" "Preserve it well and hand it over to the People's Government!" The people guarding the municipal government and the tram factory persisted for three days and nights. They persuaded the puppet municipal government's guards to hand over all the keys, properly sealed the main doors, and mobilized the original staff to jointly guard all documents, archives, and materials. Students, teachers, and workers from Shenyang Normal College and Medical College spontaneously organized pickets and guard squads, went out to publicize during the day, and took turns on night patrols to protect the schools. When the battle to attack the city began, the workers in the Tiexi District bravely led the People's Liberation Army to search for the enemy everywhere. Due to the active protection of the citizens, coupled with the strict discipline of the People's Liberation Army after entering the city and the strict protection of public property, most of Shenyang's major buildings and property were intact, laying a good foundation for the recovery work.

Starting on November 3rd, the Shenyang Military Control Commission began to separately take over the enemy's military, political, police, financial, economic, logistics, railway, and other systems. By the 5th, the takeover work had been largely completed, proceeding extremely quickly and smoothly. Many original senior officials of various organs, such as factory directors, bank presidents, heads of joint logistics departments, school principals, railway bureau directors, and directors of various municipal government bureaus, reported to work one after another. The People's Government gave each old staff member who reported to work, regardless of their position, a living allowance of 100,000 Northeast currency. The Military Control Commission adopted the method of dispatching military representatives to take over, and the military representatives ordered the old personnel in each department to stay in their posts from top to bottom according to the system, submitted registers in order and by category, and handed over materials, archives, ammunition, weapons, etc., in an orderly manner. Factories quickly resumed operations, and organs continued to operate as usual. The Shenyang Municipal Police Bureau, a large institution with eleven branch bureaus, had more than 250 branch bureau chiefs, section chiefs, and police station chiefs reporting on the first day of the takeover. That afternoon, the handover of the armed forces of over a thousand policemen was completed, and the police continued to serve. On the 4th, unarmed traffic police appeared on the streets to direct traffic. The branch bureau chiefs sent by the People's Government had already begun serving. Railway bureau employees mostly reported to work within two days and actively repaired the railway. By the 6th, railway transportation around Shenyang had been restored, and trains loaded with grain and coal were continuously entering the urban area.

At the beginning of Shenyang's liberation, merchants had many doubts due to uncertainty about currency values and prices. After the Military Control Commission announced the price situation in the Shenyang surrounding areas, and the state-owned trading institutions announced the purchase prices of goods, prices gradually stabilized, and shops resumed business one after another. On the 8th, the People's Government, based on the actual market price of the rapidly depreciating puppet gold yuan, exchanged many counterfeit gold yuan notes and counterfeit circulating notes at an exchange rate of one hundred "Northeast currency" to one "gold yuan," protecting the interests of the people and earning the deep love of the people. On the 11th, the municipal government held a symposium with industry and commerce, explaining the People's Government's policy of protecting industry and commerce to more than 120 representatives from over 80 industries. Currently, the north and south markets in Shenyang are crowded with customers, and the small market on Taiyuan Street is thriving. Cultural and educational undertakings are becoming increasingly active. Fifty-nine schools have already resumed classes. The Northeast Bookstore, which sells various progressive books, is crowded all day long. The people's newspaper, the Shenyang Times, is sold everywhere by newspaper vendors and is very popular among readers. The Xinhua Broadcasting Station has begun to report the victories of the People's Liberation Army and the thriving construction of the liberated areas to the people of the city.

　　沈阳接收恢复工作创造成功经验
    按系统有秩序的移交
  　三四天全市复工复业
    【新华社电】沈阳的接收和恢复工作是一个重要的成功的经验。这个拥有百余万人口的东北第一大城市，在解放后仅仅三四天功夫，电灯、电话、自来水、邮政、电报、电车、铁路交通等相继完全恢复，工厂纷纷复工，商店开业，物价平稳，秩序安定。人民对恢复工作的迅速，咸表钦佩。
    沈阳的接收和恢复工作的显著特点，一个是市内人民及时地自动地维持了城市治安，保护了公共财产；一个是国民党原有机关负责人员大多数都各守原职，实行了有秩序的移交。这是全国人心背弃国民党反动派而倾向中国共产党的结果，这是中国共产党执行正确的城市政策的影响已经深入人心的结果。沈阳的经验，给现在还被国民党统治着的大城市的人民、给国民党军、政、财、经、文、教机关的公务人员，立下了一个良好的榜样。他们中间的很多人还在担心着国民党军队已经溃败而解放军尚未入城时怎么办，解放军入了城又怎么办。他们可以从沈阳的经验得到有益的教训。
    沈阳人民中的先进分子，当解放军逼近城郊东陵、北陵一带，敌人已陷混乱时，就积极地进行了各项护城工作，“欢迎解放军”“欢迎共产党”的各式标语，在各街衢、广场出现。成群的产业工人、学生和机关职员，自动组织起来，冒着乱飞的子弹，日夜守护公共财产。他们说：“这下我们可等到了！”“保存好，交给人民政府！”守护市政府及电车厂等处的人民，一直坚持了三昼夜。他们劝导伪市政府的卫兵交出全部锁匙，将主要房门妥为封锁，动员原有职员共同看守一切文件、档案、资材。沈阳师范专科学校及医学专科学校的学生、教员和工友，自动组织纠察队、警备班，白天出外宣传，夜间轮流值夜巡逻护校。当攻城战斗开始时，铁西区的工人们，奋勇地带领解放军到处搜索敌人。由于市民的积极保护，加上解放军入城后，军纪严明，严格保护公共财产，使得沈阳市主要建筑物、资财，大部完好无损，为恢复工作奠定了一个良好的基础。
    十一月三日起，沈阳军事管制委员会即开始分头接收敌人的军、政、警、财、经、后勤、铁路等系统。至五日接收工作即已大致完成，进行极为迅速顺利。各机关许多原有高级职员，如工厂厂长、银行行长、联勤部门的主管人员，学校校长、铁路局长、市政府各局长等，纷纷报到上班。人民政府对旧人员上班者，不论职务，一律每人发给生活维持费东北币十万元。军管会采取派遣军事代表接收的办法，由军事代表按系统自上而下命令各部门旧人员留职，按序分门别类造册呈报，点交资材、档案、弹药、武器等，秩序井然。工厂迅速复工、机关照常办公。机构庞大，辖有十一个分局的沈阳市警察局，于接收的第一日即有各分局长、股长分驻所长等二百五十余人报到。当日下午，千余警察的武装点交完毕，警察照旧服务，四日，徒手交通警察即出现街道指挥交通。人民政府所派的分局长已开始服务。铁路局员工在两日内大部报到上班，积极修复铁路。至六日，沈阳四周的铁道交通已经恢复，满载粮煤的列车已源源驶入市区。
    沈阳解放之初，商人因不明币值和物价情况，很多疑虑。经军管委会公布了沈阳周围地区物价情况，以及公营贸易机构公布收购货物价格之后，物价日趋平稳，商店相继复业。人民政府于八日按伪金圆券急剧贬值的实际市价，以一百“东北币”比一“金圆券”的比价，收兑了许多伪金圆券与伪流通券，维护了人民的利益，深受人民爱戴。十一日市政府召开了工商座谈会，向到会的八十余行业一百二十余名代表，阐述了人民政府保护工商业政策。现沈市南北两市场顾客盈门，太原街的小市场生产大为兴旺。文化教育事业日见活跃。五十九所学校已经复课。出售各种进步书籍的东北书店内，终日拥挤。人民的报纸——沈阳时报，到处有报贩叫卖，极受读者欢迎。新华广播电台已开始向全市人民报导着人民解放军的捷报和解放区的蒸蒸日上的建设。
