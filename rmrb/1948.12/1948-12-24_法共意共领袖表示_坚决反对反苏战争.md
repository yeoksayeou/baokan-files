Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, December 22nd: Electone Agency Warsaw News: Leaders of the fighting workers' movements in major Western European countries participating in the Marshall Plan—England, France, Italy, etc.—unanimously stated during their attendance at the merger conference of the two workers' parties in Poland that the working class and the majority of the people in their respective countries firmly oppose an anti-Soviet war. Following the declaration by Harry Pollitt, General Secretary of the British Communist Party, on the 16th, Maurice Thorez, member of the Political Bureau of the French Communist Party and Secretary of the French General Confederation of Labor, declared at a press conference on the 17th that the French people would never forget that their liberation from Hitler's rule was primarily due to the great Red Army and the self-sacrificing struggle of the Soviet people. When the Franco-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance was signed in Moscow in December 1944, the French people were greatly delighted. On the other hand, however, American imperialism returned the Ruhr mining area to the Nazis, preventing France from obtaining compensation to recover from the enormous war losses. The French people understand that any intermediate position is impossible: either form a war alliance with the warmongers, or form a peace alliance with the working class. When the question of war against the Soviet Union is brought before the French people, they will definitely reject it decisively.

At the same time, Pietro Secchia, Vice-Chairman of the Italian Communist Party, also declared: It is impossible to be neutral between the peace camp and the war camp. The concept of neutrality has the effect of paralyzing public opinion and weakening the forces of peace. The Italian working class, led by the Communist Party, understands that neutrality must be abandoned immediately, and it must struggle together with all forces in the peace camp to prevent war and make it impossible to break out at all. Secchia pointed out that American and British imperialists are attempting to involve Italy in their aggression system through the "Atlantic Alliance," the "Brussels Treaty," and so on. He declared: "The workers' position is clear. We can say frankly that if the Italian government involves Italy in an anti-Soviet war, then there will be civil war in Italy, and the government should bear the responsibility for provoking the civil war."

　　法共意共领袖表示
    坚决反对反苏战争
    【新华社陕北二十二日电】电通社华沙讯：西欧参加马歇尔计划各主要国家——英、法、意等国战斗的工人运动的领袖们，在出席波兰两工人政党合并大会之际，一致表示各该国工人阶级及人民的大多数坚决反对反苏战争。继十六日英共总书记波立特发表宣言之后，法共政治局委员、法国总工会书记拉梅特十七日在记者招待会上宣称：法国人民决不会忘记，他们从希特勒统治下被解放出来，主要地应归功于伟大红军和苏联人民自我牺牲的奋斗。当一九四四年十二月法苏友好协定在莫斯科签订的时候，法国人民曾大为欢欣。但在另一方面，美帝国主义却把鲁尔矿区归还给纳粹，使法国不能得到赔偿以恢复巨大的战争损失。法国人民了解：或者是和战争贩子结成战争联盟，或者是和工人阶级结成和平联盟，任何中间的立场都是不可能的。当对苏作战的问题提到法国人民面前的时候，他们必定断然地予以拒绝。
    同时，意共副主席斯科西马罗亦宣称：在和平阵营与战争阵营之间，要中立是不可能的。中立观念起着麻痹舆论、削弱和平力量的作用。以共产党为首的意大利工人阶级了解：必须立即摈弃中立，与和平阵营中的一切力量共同奋斗，阻止战争，使它根本不能爆发。斯科西马罗指出：美英帝国主义者正企图通过“大西洋联盟”、“布鲁塞尔公约”等等，使意大利卷入他们的侵略体系中。他宣称：“工人的立场是明确的。我们可以直率说明，如果意大利政府使意大利参加反苏战争，那么，意大利就将有内战，而政府则应负挑起内战的责任。”
