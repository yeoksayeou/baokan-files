(Jinzhong Electricity) Jinzhong District Trading Company is vigorously organizing support for the front lines. After the liberation of the entire Jinzhong District, the company, despite a severe shortage of cadres, still transferred a large number of cadres and transport vehicles to actively support the front. In the support-the-front work in October alone, the first branch company transferred 73 cadres, 39 transporters, 10 large carts, and 50 pack mules, quickly surging to the front lines, enabling the troops and laborers to obtain material supplies in a timely manner. The company jointly consulted with the Logistics Command and selected appropriate locations throughout the district to set up eleven supply stations. In order to maintain close contact with the troops and ensure supply, each branch company sent special personnel to reside in columns, brigades, regiments, and other units. In terms of materials, sufficient preparations were made early. In addition to sulfur, cotton, cloth, hemp rope, pickled vegetables, garlic, dried noodles, and fuel, the amount of salt alone reached 730,000 jin. 260,000 jin of oil were also transported to the front lines successively. As for meat, in addition to the supply from the branch companies, the second branch company organized private merchants to sell more than 700 pigs and more than 1,500 sheep, ensuring the meat supply for the front lines. The company not only directly supported the front but also cooperated with the masses in developing winter production during the support work. For example, by the end of November, the first branch company had organized 47 military vendors to regulate various necessities. This not only solved their current living difficulties but also laid a considerable foundation for surviving the famine next year. In particular, it played a significant role in stabilizing prices in the war zone. Due to the continuous increase in military vendors, prices in the war zone have now fallen sharply. For example, mutton has fallen from 2,800 Jibi per jin to 1,700 Jibi. Pepper has fallen from 3,200 Jibi per jin to 1,600 Jibi. Cabbage has fallen from 400 Jibi per jin to 150 Jibi. Potatoes have fallen from 200 Jibi per jin to 100 Jibi. The company also took care of the reasonable profits of the vendors, driving private merchants to trade in large quantities in the war zone in order to ensure military and civilian needs, regulate the market, and stabilize prices in the front lines, while the supply price was always controlled and maintained slightly lower than the market level. For example, the market price of salt in Yuci Company in October was 750 yuan per jin, while the supply price was 700 yuan. In addition to supplying troops and laborers with non-staple food, the company also conducted the adjustment of necessities for the masses in the war zone according to the needs of the front. At the same time, it widely launched economic warfare against the Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan bandits besieged in the isolated city of Taiyuan, making it even more difficult for the Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan bandits to obtain food. In addition, the company's cadres overcame difficulties and actively worked in the support work. For example, when the cadres of the first branch company supporting the front had no houses to live in the villages, they slept in the open in the severe cold. When the cotton clothes of some comrades were not received in time, they also insisted on working hard. The cadres of the second branch company often transferred with the troops during the support work, actively preparing materials for the troops and ensuring the timely arrival of supplies.

　　晋中贸易公司大力支前
    保证前方物资供应
    【晋中电】晋中区贸易公司，大力组织支援前线。该公司于晋中全区解放后，虽在干部极感不足的条件下，仍抽调大批干部与运输工具，积极支援前线。仅一分公司在十月份支前工作中，即抽调干部七十三名，运输员三十九名，大车十辆，驮骡五十头，迅速涌上前线，使部队与民工及时取得物资供给。该公司曾与后勤司令部共同协商，在全区选择适宜地点，设置了十一个供应站。为了保持与部队密切联系保证供给，各分公司派专人住在纵、旅、团等部。在物资方面，则及早作了充分准备除硫磺、棉花、布匹、麻绳、咸菜、蒜、干粉、与燃料等项外，仅食盐一项为数即达七十三万斤。油二十六万斤，均先后运往前方。至于肉食方面，除分公司供应外，二分公司则组织私商贩猪七百余口，羊一千五百余只，保证了前方的肉食，该公司不仅直接进行支前，且在支前工作中配合群众发展冬季生产；如一分公司到十一月下旬止，已组织起随军商贩四十七家，调剂各种必需品。这不仅解决他们当前的生活困难，且给明年渡荒打下了相当的基础。尤其对战区物价平稳上，起了极大的作用。由于随军商贩不断的增加，目前已使战地物价急骤下降；如羊肉每斤由冀币二千八百元，已落至一千七百元。花椒每斤由三千二百元，已落至一千六百元。白菜每斤由四百元，已落至百五十元。山药蛋每斤由二百元，已落至百元。该公司并为照顾商贩的合理利润，带动私商大量到战区交易，以便保证军需民用，调剂市场，稳定前方物价，其供应价则始终掌握与保持稍低于市场之水平。如榆次该公司十月份之食盐每斤市价为七百五十元，供应价则为七百元。并根据前方需要，除供给部队与民工之副食品外，对战地群众亦进行了必需品的调剂工作。同时对被围困于太原孤城之蒋阎匪，则广泛地展开了对敌经济斗争，使蒋阎匪吃粮更加困难。此外该公司干部在支前中，克服困难积极工作；如一分公司支前的干部，在村庄小无房可住时，则于严寒中露宿；部分的同志当棉衣未及时领下时，亦紧张的坚持工作。二分公司的干部，于支前中经常随部队转移，积极为部队准备物资、保证供应的及时到达。
