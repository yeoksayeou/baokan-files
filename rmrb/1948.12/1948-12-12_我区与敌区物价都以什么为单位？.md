What unit of currency are prices in our region and the enemy region based on?
To the Editor:

Regarding the numbers comparing the price surge in the Kuomintang-controlled area before and after, in the article "Two Kinds of Prices" published on page two of the November 2nd issue of this newspaper, I don't understand some things. For example: the price limit for millet per jin on August 19th was 0.15 yuan, and the price on October 13th was 1.60 yuan. What is the unit represented by this decimal point? Also, the price of peanut oil in Shijiazhuang, in the Liberated Area, in late August was 1,830 yuan. What unit is that based on? How much is that per jin?

Answer: In order to plunder the people's wealth even more, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits announced on August 19th this year the implementation of "currency reform," stipulating that 3 million yuan of the already worthless legal tender (fabi) would be exchanged for one yuan of the so-called "gold yuan." At the same time, prices were frozen at the level of August 19th. Therefore, the calculation of prices in the enemy area was changed to "gold yuan" as the standard currency. For example, the price of millet per jin on August 19th (frozen price) was 450,000 yuan in legal tender, which when converted to "gold yuan" is 0.15 yuan (i.e., one jiao and five fen). The decimal point represents the yuan as the unit of calculation. But by October 13th (the price freeze was no longer effective), the price of millet per jin rose to 1.60 yuan (i.e., one yuan and six jiao). If converted to legal tender, it rose from 450,000 yuan to 4.8 million yuan.

The calculation of prices in Shijiazhuang is based on Jicha as the standard currency, also using yuan as the unit of calculation. For example, in late August, peanut oil was priced at 1,830 yuan per jin (i.e., one thousand eight hundred and thirty yuan). It should be 1,830.00 yuan, but because our area's prices do not require jiao or fen, there is no .00 after the decimal point. (North China Trading Company)

    我区与敌区物价都以什么为单位？
    编辑同志：
    关于本报十一月二日二版所载“两种物价”一文里，蒋管区物价前后暴涨比较的数目字内，我有些不了解，例：小米每斤八月十九日限价。一五元，十月十三日价格一．六○元，这小数点依啥为单位的？还有解放区石家庄市花生油八月下旬价格一、八三○元这又是依啥为单位的？这都又算多少元钱一斤呢？
          （馆涉铁路局工程科  王立中）
    答：蒋匪为更多的掠夺人民财富，于今年八月十九日宣布实行“币制改革”，规定用已成废纸的法币三百万元，换成所谓“金圆券”一元。同时并将物价冻结于八月十九日的水平。因此计算敌区物价则改以“金圆券”为本位币，如八月十九日小米每斤（冻结价格）法币四十五万元，改成“金圆券”计算则为·一五元（即一角五分）小数点系代表以元为计算单位的。而至十月十三日（物价冻结已毫不管用）小米每斤即涨为一．六○元（即一元六角）若合成法币则由四十五万元，涨达四百八十万元。
    而石家庄计算物价则以冀钞为本位币，同样以元为计算单位。如八月下旬，花生油每斤一、八三○元（即一千八百三十元）应是一、八三○．○○元，因我区物价用不着角分故不设小数点下的○○。（华北贸易总公司）
