Xinhua News Agency, Huaihai Front, 21st: The former Kuomintang Army 85th Corps, 110th Division, issued a declaration of uprising. The full text is as follows:

　　Ever since Mr. Sun Yat-sen personally formulated the Three Great Policies of alliance with the Soviet Union, alliance with the Communist Party, and assistance to peasants and workers, the revolutionary army was established. Later, based on this guiding principle, we launched the Northern Expedition, which was invincible and ever-victorious. Who would have thought that Chiang Kai-shek and his counter-revolutionary clique would seize the reins of power, carry out reactionary deeds in the name of revolution, and create the "April 12th" massacre, causing this great revolution to fail. Ten years of civil war poisoned the people and sold out national sovereignty, leading the wolf into the house. When the Japanese invaders invaded, they initially put up some resistance, but soon adopted a passive stance of watching the battle. When the Japanese surrendered, the people of the whole country hoped to recuperate and rebuild, but the Kuomintang reactionaries completely violated the will of the people, colluded with American imperialism, and acted perversely. At first, they used the excuse of accepting the surrender to send troops to the Liberated Areas, causing war. Later, they tore up the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference and launched a full-scale civil war, killing people in cities and fields. The crimes of the Kuomintang reactionaries reached their peak at this point. Our army originally belonged to the Kuomintang's direct lineage, was relatively well-equipped, and was more deeply poisoned by anti-communist and anti-people education. However, the soldiers are all sons of the people, and the officers are mostly young military academy graduates. The conscience of the Chinese people has not been completely extinguished, and many people can still distinguish between right and wrong, good and evil. Although the Kuomintang authorities wag their tongues, sometimes saying "unifying the country to save the nation" and sometimes saying "suppressing the rebellion to build the country," what we have heard and seen is that the Kuomintang government has signed humiliating Sino-U.S. treaties, supported the United States in supporting the revival of the Japanese invaders, American goods are flooding the market, American troops are controlling seaports, powerful families are corrupt and degenerate, and the people have no way to make a living. On the other hand, in the Liberated Areas, the people are united, the military and the people are one, the politics are clean, and the economy is prosperous. The Kuomintang is attacking justice with injustice, and attacking reason with unreasonableness. This is why the people's hearts are turned away, the financial economy is collapsing, the rear is full of holes, the morale of officers and soldiers is low, military discipline is corrupt, and the war is repeatedly defeated. The Kuomintang army has lax discipline and has lost the support of the people. If staple food is not issued, they will overturn warehouses, and if non-staple food is not issued, they will steal chickens and dogs. Wherever the army goes, villages are reduced to ruins, the people are seething with resentment, and the army is weary of war. These are all things that we have personally witnessed in the two years of civil war, and that have caused us anxiety day and night. Yunzhou and others, for the sake of the country's interests, the people's survival, and their own future, resolutely broke away from the counter-revolutionary camp in the Shuangduiji area southwest of Suxian on November 29th, raised the banner of righteousness, and joined the People's Liberation Army. From now on, we vow to fight under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong of the Chinese Communist Party, Commander-in-Chief Zhu De of the People's Liberation Army, and the leaders of the Central Plains, Liu, Chen, and Deng, to thoroughly overthrow the Kuomintang's reactionary rule and establish a people's democratic republic. Since Yunzhou and others revolted, they have been warmly welcomed and cared for in every way by the military and civilians in the Liberated Areas. It can be seen that the policy of the People's Liberation Army towards the Kuomintang army is that as long as they are truly revolutionary elements, there is no distinction between direct lineage and miscellaneous brands. All rational soldiers still bound in the Kuomintang army, all patriotic men, at this critical juncture, must distinguish between right and wrong, advantages and disadvantages, either resolutely raise the banner of righteousness, or surrender their weapons and surrender, as the only way to save themselves and save others. The Kuomintang rule is about to perish completely, and the People's Liberation Army is about to win complete victory. Where to go, you should make a quick decision.

　　Liao Yunzhou, commander of the former Kuomintang Army 85th Corps 110th Division, Yang Liuying, deputy division commander, and all officers and soldiers kowtow together. November 29, 1948.

　　前国民党军一一零师发表起义宣言
  　誓愿服从中共领导
    彻底推翻蒋匪反动统治
    【新华社淮海前线二十一日电】前国民党军第八十五军一一零师发表起义宣言，全文如下：
    溯自孙中山先生亲订联苏、联共、扶助农工三大政策，革命军队赖以建立。其后本此方针，兴师北伐，无坚不摧，无攻不克。孰意蒋介石及其反革命集团窃夺国柄，冒革命之名，行反动之实，制造“四一二”大屠杀，使此次大革命归于失败。十年内战，荼毒生灵，出卖国权，引狼入室。日寇侵入，初犹略作抵抗，随即消极观战。及日寇投降，全国人民方冀休养生息，而国民党反动派，竟完全违反民意，勾结美帝国主义，倒行逆施。其始借口受降，进兵解放区，引起战端。其后又撕毁政协决定，发起全面内战，杀人盈城盈野，国民党反动派之罪恶，至此乃达登峰造极之地步。本军原属国民党嫡系，装备较为优良，受反共反人民教育之毒害亦较深。然士兵均系人民子弟，军官多属军校青年，中国人之良心，并未完全泯灭，是非善恶，尚有不少人能知分辨。国民党当局虽摇唇鼓舌，时而曰“统一救国”，时而曰“戡乱建国”，但吾人所耳闻目见，则为国民党政府签定辱国之中美条约，拥护美国扶持日寇复兴，美货则充斥市场，美军则控制海港，豪门则贪污腐化，人民则无以为生。反观解放区则上下一心，军民一体，政治廉洁，经济繁荣。国民党以非正义而进攻正义，以无理而进攻有理，此民心之所以背离、财政经济之所以总崩溃、后方之所以千疮万孔、官兵意志之所以低沉、军纪之所以败坏、战争之所以屡战屡败。国民党军队纪律废弛，民心丧尽。不发主食则翻仓倒柜，不发副食则偷鸡盗狗，大军所至，村舍为墟，民怨沸腾，军心厌战。此均吾人两年余内战以来，所亲临目睹，而日夜所焦虑于中者。运周等为国家利益计，为人民生存计，为自身前途计，特于十一月二十九日在宿县西南双堆集地区毅然脱离反革命营垒，高举义旗，加入人民解放军。今后誓在中国共产党毛主席、人民解放军朱总司令，及中原刘、陈、邓诸首长领导之下，为彻底推翻国民党反动统治，建立人民民主共和国而奋斗。运周等起义以来，备受解放区军民热烈欢迎，多方爱护，可见解放军对国民党军之政策只要是真正革命分子，毫无嫡系杂牌之分。一切尚被羁绊于国民党军中之有理性的军人，一切爱国男儿，当此紧急关头，必须分清是非利害，或毅然举义，或缴械投诚，始为自救救人之唯一出路。国民党统治即将最后灭亡，人民解放军即将完全胜利，何去何从，幸速决择。
    前国民党军陆军第八十五军一百一十师师长廖运周，副师长杨柳营，率全体官兵同叩。一九四八年十一月二十九日。
