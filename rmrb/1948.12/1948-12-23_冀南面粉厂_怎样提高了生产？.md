Jinnan Flour Mill
    How Production Was Improved
    By Our Reporter Tian Liu
    After the Jinnan Industrial Conference in late October, the factory, in accordance with the spirit of the conference, began to improve factory management in three aspects. The first was that leading cadres painstakingly studied technology and then mastered it. For example, after repeatedly consulting and learning from Fu Fuquan, an old flour mill worker with more than 30 years of experience, they learned the algorithm for the ratio of bran to flour. This solved the long-standing problem of the flour yield of wheat (because the factory produces day and night and cannot clear the warehouse for settlement every day). They found one of the important technologies for managing a flour mill, thereby strengthening the guidance and control of production, and making it possible to conduct more practical and effective inspections and improvements.
    　　　　Leading Cadres Painstakingly Study, Master Technology, and Calculate Precisely
    Secondly, the factory strengthened precise calculations in the production process. After the factory's leading cadres mastered the bran-to-flour ratio algorithm, they immediately conducted a specific accounting from November 13th to 22nd. If the highest flour yield of wheat in these ten days, where each bag of bran yielded 7.7 bags of flour, was compared with the average yield in the ten days, the loss due to less flour production alone would be 270,000 new currency. This means that if the highest rate was maintained, it would be possible to produce 270,000 new currency more for the masses. Using such vivid facts and specific accounting methods, the sense of responsibility of all employees was stimulated. The employees felt that it was a disgrace to produce less flour, and everyone felt that improving output and quality was supreme glory. On the morning of December 1st, lead technician Yang Shukuai created a record of 8.8 bags of flour per bag of bran. Since then, the average ratio of each bag of bran to flour has been increased to 8.5, and on the 5th, a record of 9.33 was created. Similarly, as a result of precise calculations, two inches of cloth were saved for each flour bag, saving nearly 4 million currency per month. The third important improvement was the establishment of systems. The method of establishing systems in the factory was to discover a problem, solve it, and then establish a system. For example, in the past, the issuance of materials was a two-part form, with the engineering section and the storage section each keeping one part, but the accounting section did not have one. This made it impossible for the accounting department to understand the number of materials used by the workshop every day in a timely manner, which affected cost accounting. After review, it was changed to a three-part form. For another example, when the ratio of bran to flour was discovered, the daily report system was immediately established and enriched, and the simple "Daily Output Report" was improved to a "Product, Labor and Materials Daily Report." In this way, the quantity and ratio of various grades of flour and bran produced by each shift are clear at a glance. At the same time, in order to prevent the quality of flour from decreasing in the process of increasing flour yield, in addition to strengthening the engineering section's system of checking finished products every hour, a system of direct inspection of finished products by the manager has been established since late November. Other systems such as sign-in, attendance, leave, and rewards have also been gradually established as the work progresses.
    　　　　Workers' Awareness Improved After Study
    　　Consciously Responsible for Cyclic Inspection
    The second important reason for the rapid increase in output and quality of the factory is the active production of all employees and the fulfillment of their respective responsibilities by various departments, which was achieved through the factory's correct adjustment of wages, strengthening of employee education, and extensive use of competition methods. After September of this year, the factory conducted three consecutive and repeated evaluations of wages, and initially overcame the problems of unreasonable wages and egalitarianism in wages, so that the production enthusiasm of all employees tended to normalize. After the Jinnan Industrial Conference in October, the entire factory launched a study of the resolution (with the establishment of a regular study system every Tuesday and Friday), and employees further realized that the factory belongs to all the people, and that they are the masters of the factory. Workers in the flour-making department voluntarily proposed "overcoming the careless attitude in production" during the study process, and requested the establishment of a product comparison table. Each production department is studying in connection with its actual work, so the learning process is also the process of production improvement. Since then, a personal responsibility system and a cyclical inspection system have been established. For example, after studying, the wheat-beating machine workers and the screen-scraping workers consciously beat the soil and impurities in the wheat clean, and diligently scrape the screens to ensure the quality of the flour; the wheat-moistening workers accurately and moderately control the moisture to ensure the color of the flour. More importantly, the responsibilities and division of labor between the comprehensive technicians and the lead technicians were adjusted during the study process. In the past, the comprehensive technicians directly grasped the major problems of each production department, and the lead technicians only checked the execution. Sometimes, although they found that a certain machine should be adjusted, they let it go because they had no power; and the comprehensive technicians found it difficult to check regularly and thoroughly because they had to take care of too much. For example, if the bran is not clean and still contains flour, it must be caused by the large "wheat gate." Because the lead technician had no power to adjust the "wheat gate," he had to let it go. In this study, lead technician Yang Shukuai made a review and reflected the above situation. The factory management committee immediately corrected it according to everyone's opinions, deciding that the lead technician should directly control the machine under the principle of being responsible to the comprehensive technician. The result of this implementation was to give greater play to the enthusiasm and sense of responsibility of the lead technician. On the basis of the increasing sense of responsibility and enthusiasm of all employees, a mass-based cyclical inspection system adapted to the production process was naturally established. For example, after studying, the flour-receiving workers also often check the color of the flour, and immediately report to the lead technician to correct any bad flour; Chen Buniu, a worker in the engine room, was once asked to stop the car when the "flat screen" was being repaired upstairs in the flour-making building. Because the time was long, he took the initiative to urge. The workers who control the bran can check whether the "wheat gate" is large or small or whether the moisture control in the wetting section is accurate by looking at whether the bran is clean and whether the pieces are large or small. The number of changes in the "wheat gate" also checks whether the engine speed is normal, and the engine room also checks whether the boiler room maintains a certain amount of steam at the same time. Since the implementation of the mass-based cyclical inspection system, each production link has been responsible for its own responsibilities, consolidating the personal responsibility system in the production process, and connecting the entire factory into a tight production whole through the cyclical inspection system. On the other hand, it also improved the production enthusiasm of all employees and encouraged the enterprising spirit of each employee. As a result, the factory's competition movement was also launched. First, the two lead technicians of the day shift and the night shift competed with each other. On the evening of December 2nd, Ma Zhenxiang's team produced 463 bags, and on the 3rd, Yang Shukuai's team produced 473 bags during the day. Ma Zhenxiang saw this and worked harder in secret, and broke the record on the evening of the 4th, producing 482 bags. Due to the competition of the lead technicians, the two shifts of workers in the same production link also competed with each other. At present, the factory's production competition movement is in full swing. Manager Wu said: "With the development of the competition movement, the factory management committee has decided to publish the 'Product, Labor and Materials Comparison Table' for each shift in each production room at any time, announce the results to all employees at any time, and establish a reward system."
    The factory's employees are not satisfied with the achievements they have already achieved. The workers have put forward their own action slogan: "Catch up with the Jinan Flour Mill!" The factory management is also actively improving production tools. It has now started to renovate and enlarge the "wheat warehouse" to increase the time that wheat stays in the "wheat warehouse," so that the wheat is moistened appropriately, and the color and quality of the flour are improved; the manual wheat-moistening machine is being transformed into an automatic machine to ensure the accuracy and moderation of the amount of water used in the wheat. The unanimous will of the employees is: The People's Liberation Army wins battles every day, and we must also win a great victory on the production front!

　　冀南面粉厂
    怎样提高了生产？
    本报记者  田流
    十月下旬，冀南工业会议后，该厂便根据会议精神，从三方面入手来改进工厂管理。首先是领导干部下苦心学习技术，进而掌握了技术。比如向卅余年老面粉工人傅富泉一再请教学习的结果，知道了麸皮与面粉的比例算法，使苦恼已久无法解决的麦子产粉量问题迎刃而解（因该厂系日夜生产，不能天天清仓结算），找到了管理面粉工厂重要技术之一，由而加强了对生产的指导与掌握，使有可能进行更加切合实际的有效的检查和改进。
    　　　　领导干部苦心学习　掌握技术精密计算
    其次，是加强了生产过程中的精密计算，该厂领导干部在掌握住麸皮与面粉比例算法后，立即从十一月十三日至廿二日进行了一次具体算帐：如果拿这十天内麦子最高产粉量每包麸皮比七·七袋面与十日内的平均量作比较的话，仅因少出面粉就损失了新币廿七万元，就是说如都保持这个最高率，就能多给群众生产新币廿七万元了，用这样生动的事实，具体算帐的方法，激励起了全厂职工的责任心，职工们感到出面少是自己的耻辱，大家都觉得提高产量和质量是无上的光荣。十二月一日的早晨，带班技师杨书奎创造了一包麸皮比八·八袋面粉的最高纪录，此后每包麸皮与面粉的平均比数已经提高到一比八·五，五日竟创一比九·三三的最高纪录。同样由于精细计算的结果，每个面袋即省了二寸布，每月就节省近四百万元。第三个重要的改进是建立制度。该厂建立制度的方法是：发现一个问题解决一个问题，随即建立制度。比方过去领发材料是两联单，只工务科与保管科各存一联，会计科没有，这样便使会计对工房每天使用材料的数目不能及时了解，因而在成本计算上受了影响，经检讨后，改成了三联单；再如当发现了麸皮与面粉的比例后，立即建立与充实了每日表报制度，将简单的“产量日报表”改进为“产品工料日报表”，这样以来，每班生产的各种等次的面粉和麸皮数量及其比例就一目了然。同时为防止在提高产粉量的过程中面粉质量降低，除加强工务科每小时检查一次成品的制度外，从十一月下旬开始已建立起经理直接检查成品制度。其他如签到、考勤、请假、奖励制度，也随着工作的进展而逐渐建立起来。
    　　　　工人学习后觉悟提高
    　　自觉负责循环检查
    该厂产量质量迅速提高的第二个重要原因，是全体职工的积极生产，与各个部门的各尽其责，而这又是因为该厂正确的调整工资，加强职工教育，和广泛的运用比赛方法获得的。该厂在今年九月后，曾连续反复的进行了三次评议工资，初步克服了工资不合理，与工资中的平均主义毛病，使全体职工生产情绪趋于正常。十月冀南工业会议后，全厂又展开了对该决议的学习（随着就建立起了每星期二、五的正规学习制度），职工进一步认识到工厂是属于全体人民，及自己在工厂中的主人翁地位。制粉部工人学习过程中自动提出“克服生产中的浪荡心”，并要求建立起产品比较表。每个生产部门都是连系着自己的实际工作进行学习的，因此学习的过程也是生产改进的过程，自此建立起个人负责制和循环检查制。如打麦机工人、刮筛工人经学习后，自觉的打净麦子的土杂质，勤刮筛以保证面粉的质量；润麦工人水分掌握的准确适度，以保证面粉色泽；更重要的是在学习过程中调整了全面技术与带班技师的职责与分工。过去全面技师直接掌握各生产部门的重大问题，带班技师仅仅是检查执行，有时虽然发现某个机器应该调整，但因自己无权，也就放过去了；而全面技师因照顾面太广，便很难经常的周到的检查到，比方麸皮不清亮，仍含有面粉，必然是“麦门”大所致，带班技师因为无权调整“麦门”，只好任其下去，在这次学习中带班技师杨书奎作了检讨并反映出上述情况。工厂管理委员会根据大家意见，立即进行纠正。决定带班技师在对全面技师负责的原则下直接掌握机器。这样实行的结果，便发挥了带班技师更大的积极性与责任心。在全体职工日益增强的责任心与积极性的基础上，适应着生产过程的群众性的循环检查制便自然而然的建立起来了，如接面工人学习后，也时常的检查着面的成色，遇有不好的面粉，立即报告带班技师改正；引擎房工人陈不牛，有一次制粉楼上修理“平筛”让他停了车，因时间较长他便主动督促。掌握麸皮的工人，看着麸皮的清亮与否和片大片小，就可检查出“麦门”大小或湿润部掌握水分是否准确，“麦门”变动次数又检查到引擎速度是否正常，引擎房也就同时检查锅炉房是否保持着一定的汽量，自从群众性的循环检查制实行后，便使每个生产环节各负其责，巩固了生产过程中的个人负责制，并通过了循环检查制把全厂连成了严密的生产整体。另方面也提高了全体职工的生产积极性，并鼓励了每个职工的进取心。由而全厂的比赛运动也就随着开展起来了。首先是日班和夜班两个带班技师竞赛起来，十二月二日晚马振乡班出面四六三袋，三日白天杨书奎班便出了四七三袋，马振乡一看更加暗中使劲，四日晚上便打破了纪录，出面四八二袋，由于带班技师的竞赛，也就带动了同一生产环节的两班工人比赛起来了。目前，该厂工人的生产比赛运动方兴未艾。吴经理说：“随着比赛运动的展开，工厂管理委员会已决定在每个生产间随时公布每班‘产品工料比较表’，随时向全体职工公布成绩，并将建立奖励制度。”
    该厂职工们并没有满足他们已经获得的成绩，工人们又自己提出了行动口号：“赶上济南面粉厂！”工厂管理方面也正积极改良生产工具，现已动工改造和加大“麦仓”，以增加麦子在“麦仓”中停留的时间，使麦子湿润适度，提高面粉的色泽和质量；改造人工润麦机为自动机，以保证麦子使水量的准确适度。职工们的一致意志是：解放军天天打胜仗，咱们也要在生产战线上打个大胜仗！
