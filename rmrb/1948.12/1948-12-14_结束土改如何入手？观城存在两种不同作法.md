(Jilu Yu Telegram) Last month, Guancheng County began work to end land reform in sixty villages. At the District Committee Joint Meeting on November 18th, the work done in the four days from the 12th to the 15th was reviewed, and two different approaches were found: The first is the correct approach: generally, first explain the policies of ending land reform and rectifying the Party to dispel the concerns of Party members and the masses, then understand the village's class, land, branch, and mass situation, unite the Party's activists and better elements to jointly lead and promote the branch's work. For villages where class status has not been determined, some are trialing the process in the branch, combining Party rectification to adjust the branch committee leadership, while others have completed the branch's process and are conducting class status determination among the masses and reorganizing the mass ranks, while also sweeping away feudal remnants. In villages where class status has been determined, some are adjusting land, some have determined land rights and are adjusting house sites and wasteland, or have begun to organize the management of public labor and land cultivation. In this way, the enthusiasm of branch members is gradually mobilized in the work, criticism and self-criticism are carried out, and some are preparing to publicly rectify the Party at the end of the month. For individual villages where floods have caused reduced harvests and the masses are experiencing hardship, the focus is on leading sideline production first, according to the urgent needs of the masses. Starting from this point, they enter Party rectification and the end of land reform. The results of doing so have been relatively smooth. The other is the wrong approach. Generally, they do not publicize policies, do not analyze the situation, and work blindly and subjectively. For example, in Li Guan Village, cadres entered the village without understanding the situation and held a branch meeting without explaining the task or policy, simply asking Party members to discuss work. As a result, after three or four evenings of discussion, there was no clear direction, and the Party members were exhausted and demoralized. In Chengdongguan Village, Party members were not given explanations of policies, and the effort did not rely on activists and better elements, so Party members did not know why or how to resolve branch disputes. As a result, most Party members were not enthusiastic, and the problems were entangled and the work could not proceed. Zhangtun wanted to mobilize the enthusiasm of all Party members in the branch before carrying out the work, but because there was no actual content to mobilize, the enthusiasm became lower and lower. Qianxiagou tried to formally rectify all village-level organizations as a separate task upon entering the village, forming a stage. All of the above approaches have failed.

    结束土改如何入手？观城存在两种不同作法
    【冀鲁豫电】上个月，观城县在六十个村里开展了结束土改的工作。在十一月十八的区分委联席会上，检查了十二日至十五日四天的工作，发现有两种不同的入手方法：第一种是正确的作法：一般是首先讲明结束土改与整党的政策，以解除党员与群众顾虑，进而了解村里的阶级、土地、支部、群众情况，团结党内积极分子较好分子，共同领导推动支部进行工作。对于未划阶级的村庄，有的正在支部试划，结合整党调整支委领导，有的支部划完，正在进行群众中的划阶级及整编群众队伍，同时扫清封建残余。在已经划完阶级的村庄，有的正在调剂土地，有的已经确定地权正在调剂宅场荒地，或开始整理支差代耕。这样，在工作中逐渐发动支部党员的积极性，开展批评自我批评，有的并准备月底公开支部进行整党。对个别水淹歉收群众生活困难的村庄，正根据群众迫切要求，首先领导副业生产。从此入手，进入整党结束土改。这样做的结果都比较顺利。另一种是错误的入手方法。一般是不宣传政策，不分析情况，主观盲目的干。如李官村干部进村还不了解情况，就开支部会，也没讲明任务与政策，就叫党员讨论工作，结果讨论了三四晚上，也没有头绪，闹的党员疲惫没劲。城东关村不给党员讲解政策，不依靠积极分子较好分子，使党员不知道为什么及如何解决支部纠纷，结果多数党员情绪不高，问题纠缠不清工作不能进行。张屯想把支部全体党员积极性发动起来后再进行工作，结果因无实际发动内容，情绪越来越低。前夏沟入村就企图把所有的村级组织都形式的整顿一下，当成一个单独任务，形成一个阶段。以上作法，都失败了。
