    张家口北收复张北歼敌千五百
    【新华社北平前线十七日电】解放军在十四日晚占领北平以南的丰台后，又占领了丰台以西的宛平县城。由平北沙河镇地区经北平西郊向丰台、宛平攻击前进的解放军，十四日上午在香山、黄村一带，将敌交警十三总队三大队及保安二旅大部歼灭。当日下午攻抵北平西南丰台以北十余里的岳各庄，与敌一零一军遭遇，将其全部击溃，俘敌二千余名。同时并击退由岳各庄以东马官宫出援之敌，缴获装甲车十四辆，毁坦克二辆。解放军另部十二日在北平东南约五十里的牛保屯镇，歼敌通县常备队一个连。十三日继在牛保屯西之马驹桥，歼敌二零五师三团及保二旅各一连，俘敌三百余。
    【新华社华北十七日电】北平前线解放军今日解放北平最大飞机场所在地南苑和北平发电所所在地石景山。南苑在北平以南约二十里，石景山在北平以西十八里。北平以西约六十里的重要煤矿区门头沟于十六日被解放。矿内职工并自动地组织起来，完好地保护了矿内的一切机器设备。五千矿工于解放的当日即照常上工。
    【新华社平绥前线十七日电】人民解放军于十五日下午攻占张家口北面军事要地的张北县城，歼灭守敌骑十四总队一部及保警队等共一千五百余人。详细战果正清查中。
    【新华社淮海前线十七日电】此次在宿县西南双堆集地区全部被歼的国民党军黄维第十二兵团，除直属队外，共辖四个军，十一个师及一个快速纵队，共约十二万人。四个军与十一个师的番号如下：第八军，辖十一师、一一八师、四十九师；八十五军，辖二十三师、一一零师、二一六师；十军，辖十八师、七十五师、一一四师，十四军，辖十师、八十五师。以上十一个师共辖三十一个团。一个快速纵队为第四快速纵队。其中除八十五军一一零师两个团，在师长廖运周将军率领下起义，该军二十三师两个团残部及军直野炮营由二十三师师长黄子华率领投降外，其余全部被歼。黄维兵团全部为蒋贼嫡系部队：十八军原为整十一师，师长为胡琏，该军原为陈诚起家的部队，在一九四五年三月全部装备美械。八十五军原为汤恩伯部队，抗日战争中以汤部一一零师为基础，扩编而成。在解放战争中，该军因未与解放军多接触，故尚未受到歼灭性打击，此次终遭全歼。十军为原整三师，系李仙洲旧部，在一九四六年九月及一九四七年十二月曾遭解放军两次全歼。十四军为原整十师，系卫立煌旧部，一九四一年曾任重庆卫戍部队。
