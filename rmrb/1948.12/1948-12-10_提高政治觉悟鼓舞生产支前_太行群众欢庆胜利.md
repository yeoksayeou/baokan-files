　　Enhance Political Awareness, Boost Production and Support the Front
  　Taihang Masses Celebrate Victory

　　[Our Newspaper] The masses in Taihang are celebrating the great victories since the Autumn Offensive with jubilation. In particular, after the responsible person of the CCP Central Committee published a military commentary on November 16th, declaring that it would only take about a year from now to fundamentally overthrow the Kuomintang reactionary government, cadres and the masses were even more inspired. When this newspaper arrived in Huguan on November 24th, everyone was so happy that they forgot to eat, and immediately convened an emergency meeting of various organizations, groups, and schools. Comrade Li Sen, the county party secretary, sincerely said to everyone: “We did not expect such a great victory as the Autumn Offensive. The development of the revolutionary situation is too fast, we must step up our study of current events to avoid falling behind the wheels of history." At the same time, he designated to re-study the "Summary of the Second Year and Tasks of the Third Year of the People's Liberation War" and the military commentary of the central person in charge this time, so that cadres can maintain a clear mind and improve their awareness in the victory. He asked everyone to improve work efficiency, meet the victory, overcome family concepts, prepare to go out and liberate all of China. At the same time, it was decided to launch a victory propaganda week. The county party committee and the county government made various preparations. The county party committee went to various districts to provide specific leadership, and the county government and other agencies organized to go to the countryside for in-depth propaganda. On the 25th, 28 villages near the city held a celebration meeting. All the stilt walkers from various villages came out together, with gongs and drums blaring, jubilant and inspiring. After the meeting, a lantern parade was held. When the masses learned that the national victory was not far away, the enthusiasm for production and support for the front was greatly improved. A young man said: "This battle is like hoeing the ground. It is almost finished. Everyone on the front line is working hard. It will be victorious in a year. Toppling Chiang Kai-shek is this time. If we don't go now, we won't be able to fight even if we want to. We have to go to the front and work hard." Ping Shun Cheng Guan District held a celebration meeting of more than 2,000 people from 14 villages on November 28. At the meeting, County Chief Zhao first explained that there are two major events to celebrate at present. One is the great victory of our army's Autumn Offensive. One million enemies were wiped out in four months, which fundamentally changed the balance of power between the enemy and us, and greatly shortened the time of victory. The other is the completion of the greatest historical task - the victorious end of land reform. At the same time, he explained that the completion of land reform does not mean the victory of the revolution. In the future, farmers must be organized under the leadership of the Party, cooperate and help each other, develop production, overcome the tendency of freedom, looseness, lack of organization and leadership, and actively engage in the production and construction of new democracy to ensure the national victory of the war and ensure everyone's vested fruits. An old man who had been emancipated said: "This victory should be celebrated. Some people complain about the heavy burden. Today's weight is for the lightness in the future. In the past, we couldn't go out without land, and our family was starving. Now we pay more, but our family still has something to eat." "It's great to pay more if we can fight like this in four months." "Let's join the war. It's better to join the war far away than near."... In front of a large propaganda poster, when he saw that only five or six black spots were left in this large area of North China, a young man pointed to Xinxiang and Taiyuan and said, "You, you, you, you will soon have the red flag planted." Wu'an held a victory celebration meeting on November 17. About 20,000 people from various agencies, groups, schools, urban residents, and villagers near the city voluntarily participated. Full preparations were made before the meeting, drawing maps, compiling allegro, writing scripts...etc. Early on the 17th, the whole city became jubilant. The allegro group played out the live capture of Wang Yaowu in Shandong for a while, and then came out Zheng Dongguo's surrender in Northeast China. The streets and alleys were filled with laughter. The original plan was to end after the meeting, but by the evening the lights were shining brightly, and the celebration continued until late at night. At the celebration meeting in Gaoyi, the masses heard about the complete liberation of the Northeast. They saw that no one dared to take over after the KMT Executive President Weng Wenhao stepped down in the cartoon, Chen Bulei committed suicide, and Chiang Kai-shek vomited blood. They all said, "The army is defeated like a mountain. The Secretary-General has committed suicide, and Chiang Kai-shek is really fast!" Some said: "This year's victory is different from last year. Last year, Yuanshi Shimen was recovered. This year, the entire Northeast was liberated, and many big cities were taken down. It looks like Tianjin and Beiping will be soon. Next year's victory will be even greater." At the victory celebration meeting in Licheng, labor hero Wang Jucai and textile hero Ma Sannv both proposed to celebrate the victory by joining the army, supporting the front, and working hard in production, striving to overthrow Chiang Kai-shek as soon as possible and liberate the people in the Chiang-controlled areas.

　　提高政治觉悟鼓舞生产支前
  　太行群众欢庆胜利
    【本报讯】太行各地群众正以狂欢庆祝秋季攻势以来的伟大胜利。特别是十一月十六日中共中央负责人发表军事评论，宣告根本上打倒国民党反动政府从现时起只需一年左右时间以后，干部群众更为振奋。十一月廿四日这张报纸到了壶关后，大家高兴得连饭也顾不上吃，当即召开了各机关团体学校的紧急会议。县委书记李森同志诚恳的向大家说：“象秋季攻势这样大的胜利，我们是没有预料到的。革命形势的发展太快，我们要加紧时事学习，以免落于历史车轮之后”。同时指定重新学习“人民解放战争第二年总结和第三年任务”及这次中央负责人的军事评论，使干部在胜利中清醒头脑提高觉悟。要求大家提高工作效率，迎接胜利，克服家庭观念，准备打出去，解放全中国。同时决定开展一个胜利宣传周，县委会和县府作了各种准备工作，县委并赴各区具体领导，县府等机关则组织下乡深入宣传。二十五号城附近二十八个村举行了庆祝大会，各村高跷等一齐出动，锣鼓喧天，欢腾鼓舞，会后还举行了提灯游行。当群众知道了全国胜利已是不久的事情的时候，生产支前情绪大大提高。一个年青人说：“这阵打仗就跟锄地一样，眼看到快锄完了，人家都在前线干的一股劲。一年光景就要胜利，打倒蒋介石就是这一打了，再不去就想打也打不上了，咱也得到前边赶快干干哩。”平顺城关区在十一月二十八日举行十四个村两千多人的庆祝大会，会中赵县长首先说明目前有两件大事要庆祝，一是我军秋季攻势的伟大胜利，四个月中歼敌百万，促使敌我力量起了根本变化，大大缩短了胜利时间。另一是完成了最大的历史任务——胜利地结束了土改。同时说明土改完成，并不就是革命胜利，今后农民必须在党的领导下，组织起来，合作互助，发展生产，克服自由散漫无组织无领导的倾向，积极从事新民主主义的生产建设，保证了战争的全国胜利，才能保证大家的既得果实。一个翻身老汉说：“这胜利可该庆祝，有人嫌负担重，今日重也是为了将来轻，以前咱没地不出，家里可在饿肚子，现时出的多，家里可还有的吃”。“四个月打成个这样子，这就多出点也痛快”。“参战就参吧，参战远点总比近点好”………在大幅的宣传挂图前，看见华北这大地方只剩了五六个黑点时，一个年青人指着新乡和太原说：“你呀你呀，你也快插上红旗啦”。武安十一月十七日举行祝捷大会，各机关团体学校、城关区市民，及城附近村庄自动参加的群众共约两万余人。会前做好充分准备，画地图、编快板、写剧本……等，十七号一早全城就狂欢起来，快板组一会扮出了山东活捉王耀武，一会又出来了东北郑洞国投降，大街小巷一片欢笑声。原计划开完大会就结束，但到了晚上灯烛辉煌，一直狂欢到深夜。高邑群众在庆祝大会上，听到了东北的全部解放，看见漫画中画的蒋匪行政院长翁文灏下台后没人敢接位，陈布雷自杀及蒋介石吐血的狼狈模样，都说：“兵败如山倒，秘书长都寻死了，蒋介石真快了”！有的说：“今年这胜利可和去年不同，去年收复了元氏石门，今年就解放了全东北，又拿下很多大城市，眼看着天津北平也快啦，明年的胜利那就会更大啦。”黎城的祝捷大会上，劳动英雄王聚财，纺织英雄马三女都提出要以参军支前，劳动生产来庆祝胜利，争取早日打倒蒋介石，解放蒋管区的老百姓。
