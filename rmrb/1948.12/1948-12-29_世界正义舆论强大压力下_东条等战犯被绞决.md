　　Under the Strong Pressure of World Righteous Public Opinion
  　Tojo and Other War Criminals Executed by Hanging
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th. Under the strong pressure of world righteous public opinion, the American reactionaries had no choice but to abandon their attempts to delay and alter the Far East International Military Tribunal's verdict on Japanese war criminals, and on the morning of the 23rd, they executed by hanging Tojo and the other seven Japanese war criminals who had been sentenced to death. Prior to this, the U.S. Supreme Court had, on the 20th, overruled its previous decision by a vote of six to one, determining that it had no jurisdiction to hear the appeals of the Japanese war criminals. On the morning of the 23rd, Tojo Hideki, Doihara Kenji, Hirota Koki, Itagaki Seishiro, Matsui Iwane, Kimura Heitaro, and Muto Akira, the seven Japanese arch-criminals who had been sentenced to death by the Far East International Military Tribunal, were executed by hanging at Sugamo Prison in Tokyo by the U.S. Eighth Army. Representatives from the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain and other countries of the Allied Council for Japan were present to supervise the execution of the above seven war criminals.

　　世界正义舆论强大压力下
  　东条等战犯被绞决
    【新华社陕北二十六日电】在世界正义舆论的强大压力之下，美国反动派不得不放弃其拖延与改变远东国际军事法庭对日本战犯判决书之企图，而于二十三日晨将东条等七名被判死刑的日本战犯，执行绞决。在此以前，美国最高法院曾于二十日以六票对一票，否决它以前的决议，决定它无权受理日本战犯的上诉。二十三日清晨，业经远东国际军事法庭判处死刑的东条英机、土肥原贤二、广田弘毅、板垣征四郎、松井石根、木村兵太郎及武藤章等七名日本罪魁，由美国第八军负责，在东京巢鸭监狱执行绞刑。上述七名战犯绞决时，盟国对日委员会苏、美、英等国代表，均在场监刑。
