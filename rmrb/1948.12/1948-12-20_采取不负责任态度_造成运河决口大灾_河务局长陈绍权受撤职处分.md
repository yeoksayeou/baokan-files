Xinhua News Agency, East China, 18th. Chen Shaoquan, the chief of the Canal Affairs Bureau, who was responsible for the canal breach this year, has been dismissed from his post. The canal in the Bohai area of Shandong breached in the De County section at the end of July this year, flooding more than 270 villages in De County, Wuqiao, Nanpi and other counties, affecting more than 150,000 mu of land. After the entire region worked hard to repair it, using nearly 200,000 workers, the embankment section was fully restored at the end of September. Afterwards, the Bohai Administrative Office investigated the responsibility and believed that Chen Shaoquan, the chief of the Canal Affairs Bureau, should be held responsible for the breach, and he was dismissed from his post. In the "Circular on the Canal Breach Issue," the Bohai Administrative Office pointed out that Chen Shaoquan only issued a document for this year's spring repairs and summer defense of the canal, without holding meetings to discuss and arrange the work, let alone in-depth inspections and supervision. The organization of the canal affairs section was a mere formality. Even in the De County section, where the Canal Affairs Bureau was located, the floodwaters were already full of the canal, but no one was guarding the embankment, and there was no preparation for emergency repairs. When the Cai Zhuangzi dam had already opened and the main embankment was in critical condition, Chen Shaoquan was still irresponsible and failed to take necessary measures, which eventually led to a major disaster. In the subsequent damming work, Chen Shaoquan still adopted an extremely unserious and irresponsible attitude: he easily decided and easily abandoned the damming project plan at Shaomaying; he openly disobeyed the decisions of his superiors, was arrogant, and went his own way; he had no plan for the collection and use of manpower and materials, and forced orders, causing great losses and waste, so that the damming project was once suspended due to the lack of materials. Therefore, the Administrative Office believes that Chen Shaoquan should bear direct responsibility for this year's canal breach. The "Circular" continued: The Administrative Office did not adequately estimate the water situation of the canal, lacked inspection of the work of the Canal Affairs Bureau, and failed to prevent problems before they occurred, and is willing to accept the strict criticism of the people of the entire region. The governments in the breach areas neglected prevention and should also conduct in-depth reviews and learn lessons. The "Circular" also commended all the employees who worked hard to participate in the damming and diversion of water. For the people in the disaster areas, in addition to ordering governments at all levels to provide practical assistance and relief, the "Circular" also called on them to help each other and restore production under the leadership and relief of the Party and the government.

　　采取不负责任态度
  　造成运河决口大灾
  　河务局长陈绍权受撤职处分
    【新华社华东十八日电】应对今年运河决口负责的运河河务局长陈绍权，已受到撤职处分。山东渤海区运河于今年七月底在德县段决口，水淹德县、吴桥、南皮等县二百七十余村，土地十五万余亩。经全区努力抢修，用工近二十余万个，该段堤岸始于九月底全部修复。事后渤海行署追查责任，认为此次决口应由运河河务局长陈绍权负责，特予以撤职处分。渤海行署在“关于运河决口问题的通令”中指出：陈绍权对于今年运河的春修与夏防工作，仅仅发出一纸公文，既未开会讨论布置，更少深入检查督促。河务段的组织形同虚设，就在河务局所在地的德县段，洪水已经满槽，堤上尚无人看守，抢险堵口器材毫无准备。当蔡庄子埝已经开口，大堤形势危急时，陈绍权依然不负责任，不采必要措施，终致酿成巨灾。在以后的堵口工作中，陈绍权仍采取极不严肃与不负责任的态度：对哨马营堵口工程计划轻易决定又轻易放弃；对上级决定阳奉阴违，自高自大，一意孤行；对于人力料物之筹集使用，没有计划，强迫命令，造成很大的损失浪费，以致堵口工程曾因料物不继一度停顿。因此行署认为今年运河决口，陈绍权应负直接责任。“通令”继称：行署对于运河水情估计不足，对于运河河务局的工作缺少检查，未能防患未然，愿受全区人民的严格批评。决口地区的政府疏于防范，也应深刻检讨，接受教训。“通令”并表扬所有奋力参加堵口顺水员工。对于灾区人民，“通令”中除责成各级政府予以切实帮助与救济外，并号召他们在党与政府的领导和救济下，互助互济，恢复生产。
