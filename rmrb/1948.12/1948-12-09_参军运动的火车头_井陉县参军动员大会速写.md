　　The Locomotive of the Army Recruitment Movement
    ——A Quick Sketch of the Jingxing County Army Mobilization Meeting
    He Jianping
    After studying the situation and mobilizing for army recruitment at the county-wide cadre meeting, a general discussion began. County Secretary Han Shaobai fired the first shot: "Don't think I'm old, if the Party allows it, I still want to join the army! I'll go wherever I'm transferred, no matter how far." Then, Deputy County Secretary Du Shixiu reviewed his own thinking: "When the county was divided in 1940, I was left alone in the south of the road (referring to the south of the Shijiazhuang-Taiyuan Railway). I thought it was really unpleasant because I was in an unfamiliar place. But now I understand: the situation is encouraging us, I want to lead our county's new recruits to join the army. I've prepared everything now, the clothes are washed, just waiting to go!"
    The northern half of the venue was thrown into chaos, with many people raising their fists and asking to speak. After Comrade Liu Chunzhi signed up on behalf of the eleven members of the Industry and Commerce Bureau, Bi Deyi, representing the four comrades from the Post Office Business Office, said: "We are all young lads, and we resolutely request approval to join the army!"
    The challenge from the county government's Party branch to the county Party committee and other branches was not over yet, and Auntie Qi, 43, from the Women's Federation protested: "The county Party committee branch reported early, why don't you ever let me speak?" Wang Xiuying, who had only been working for a month, blushed and challenged all the women cadres in the county: "I guarantee that my man will join the army, who dares to accept the challenge!" The venue immediately erupted into a chorus of shouts. The chairman's loud calls were drowned out, and only the voice of a female comrade in the west could be heard clearly: "The Fourth District reported to the chairman long ago, the Fourth District reported long ago!" Another said: "It doesn't matter if you reported early, I want to add to it."
    The right to speak was finally seized by Du Fubao, the secretary of the Fifth District: "The whole country will win in about a year, and Pingjin will be captured soon. I resolutely join the army! I guarantee that the Fifth District will complete one hundred people!"
    Comrade Han Heini stood up, her words filled with glorious pride: "This spring, I sent my man to the front line. This time, I want to mobilize all the women in the district not to lag behind. I am a female comrade, and I cannot join the army, but I will absolutely obey any transfer, wherever you say!"
    The chairman waved his hands but could not stop the chaos in the venue. The order of speeches had to be changed to follow the order of the notes submitted. When it was the Second District's turn to speak, they challenged the Third District: guarantee the completion of one hundred new soldiers, the method should be good, the quality should be high, and Party members should account for two-tenths. "We are rivals in grain requisition, and we will fight you again this time! If we lose, we are willing to use the surplus from our food to send you a red flag!"
    In the west, Gao Jiji, a female comrade who had just left production, said somewhat shyly, but very firmly: "My husband escaped and returned, and I want to guarantee that he will return to the team!" Then, two female comrades from the Seventh District requested to go to the front as nurses, and Comrade Xiao Yin, a correspondent from the Public Security Bureau, said: "I will not return to see the people of Jingxing until I defeat Chiang Kai-shek!" In the First District, in addition to the four old cadres who can enlist or go south at any time, even the three new cadres will go together. The guard Li Bingbing can blow the bugle, and he has already assigned himself a job at the meeting: "Go to be a bugler."
    When Comrade Dong Yushu, the district chief of the Seventh District, stood up to speak, people's attention was focused on this big man with a strong Xingtai accent. He said: "I am a rough man, illiterate. The characters were exploited by feudalism. I herded cattle and sheep for the landlord when I was thirteen. After a year, the landlord fired me. Poor people can't herd cattle either! Speaking of status, who would have dared to enter the district office before? Now I am also the district chief. When I was a child, I once herded sheep barefoot for two months. In the winter, I was so cold on the hillside that I cried, but the sky wouldn't get dark. At that time, I had never seen a brand new cotton coat. There are four people in my family, and we ate eight pounds of rice in ten days. My mother couldn't wear a cotton coat and froze to death! After joining the revolution, I wore two and a half brand new cotton coats. The party gave them to me! I want to ask the county party committee to approve my joining the army. I'm not old yet, I'm only thirty-one this year! Don't look at my eye, it was damaged when I was a child, it doesn't affect things. If you don't believe me, let's compare in a night march. Now there is a guarantee at home, the women can live, I won't care about them, I will rely on the revolutionary family, and no longer rely on the two acres of sandy land and five dilapidated houses that were divided. The revolutionary family has everything, cotton when it's needed, singles when they're needed, and hospitals when we're sick. When the whole country wins, I will ride the train back to see my parents and my wife. This is the truth, you don't need to laugh!"
    After a burst of applause and laughter, eighteen more comrades spoke. The chairman's desk was piled up with dozens of collective and individual registration forms and challenges. Many people also solemnly affixed their seals and fingerprints under their names. After the county party committee read the letter to the prefectural committee requesting to join the army and go south or north, everyone poured into the signature campaign. Of the two hundred and seventy-five comrades present, one hundred and ninety-nine signed their names. This is a guarantee to the Party, this is an oath to the Party under the encouragement of victory, and this oath will guarantee the complete victory of the expansion mission and make victory come faster.

　　参军运动的火车头
    ——井陉县参军动员大会速写
    何建平
    全县干部会议经过形势学习与参军动员，开始大会讨论。县书韩少白同志打了头一炮：“别看我老了，如果党允许，我还要参军！调动工作去哪儿也行，不分远近。”接着县委副书记杜士秀同志检讨了自己：“一九四○年划县时把我单独留到路南（按指石太铁路以南），心想人生地生，真不痛快；可是这回搞通了：形势鼓舞着我们，我要带领咱县新兵参军，现在东西都准备好了，衣服也洗了，就等着走！”
    这一下会场北半部可乱起来，许多人举着拳头要求发言。刘春智同志代表工商局十一人报名后，毕德义代表邮局业务室四个同志说：“我们都是青年小伙子，坚决要求批准参军！”
    县府的支部书记向县委机关及其他支部的挑战还没有完，妇联会四十三岁的齐大姐提出抗议：“县委机关支部早报了告，为什么老不叫俺发言？”参加工作仅仅一个月的王秀英红着脸向全县妇女干部挑了战：“我保证我男人参军，谁敢应战！”会场立即喊成了一片。主席的大声疾呼被淹没了，只有西面一个女同志的声音还能听清：“四区早就报告主席了，四区早就报告了！”另一个说：“你们早报告了也不行，我要补充。”
    发言权终于被五区区书杜富保同志夺了去：“全国一年左右就要胜利，不久就要打下平津，我坚决参军！保证五区完成一百人！”
    韩黑妮同志站起来了，她的话里充满着光荣的骄傲：“我今年春天把男人送上前线，这回要动员全区妇女不拉尾巴。我是女同志，不能参军，也绝对服从调动，说哪儿就哪儿！”
    主席挥动着双手也制止不住会场的纷乱，发言次序不得不改由按递条先后进行。轮到二区发言，他们向三区挑了战：保证完成一百名新战士，方式要好，质量要高，党员要占十分之二。“咱们征粮就是对手，这回还和你们干！要是我们输了，情愿用伙食节余给你们送一面红旗！”
    在西边，才脱离生产的女同志高吉吉有些害羞地、但又非常坚决地说：“我丈夫逃亡回来，我要保证他归队！”接着是七区两个女同志要求去前方当看护员，公安局通讯员小尹同志表示：“不打败蒋贼不回来见井陉群众！”一区除四个老干部可随时入伍或南调外，连三个新干部也要一块走。警卫员李兵兵会吹号，在会上已替自己分配了工作：“去当司号员。”
    七区区长董玉书同志站起来讲话时，人们的目标都集中到这满口邢台土话的大个子身上。他说：“俺是个老粗，不识字，字也叫封建剥削了。俺十三上给财主放牛放羊，放了一年人家把俺开了，穷人放牛也放不开！提起地位，早先谁敢进进区里的门？现在也当上了区长。俺小时候有一回光着脚放了两个月的羊。冬天在坡上冻的光哭，盼天黑天也不黑。那时候就没见过里表三新的棉衣裳。家里四口人，十天吃了八斤米，俺娘穿不上棉衣冻饿死了！参加革命以后，穿了两身半里表三新的棉衣，这是党给的！俺要请县委批准参军。俺还不老，今年才三十一！你们不要看俺一个眼，这是小时坏的，不累事，不信咱们夜行军比比。现在家里也有了保证，女人能生活，我就不管她们，我要靠革命大家庭，再不靠分的那二亩沙地，五间破房了。革命大家庭什么都有，该棉有棉，该单有单，病了有医院。全国胜利了俺再骑上火车回来看老人，看老婆。这是实话，你们不用笑！”
    经过一阵掌声和笑声，又有十八个同志发言。主席桌上积压了十几张集体的、个人的报名书、挑战书。许多人在名字下面还郑重的盖了图章和手印。当县委宣读了给地委请求参军及南下北上的信以后，大家涌入了签名运动。到会的二百七十五个同志中，有一百九十九个签了名。这是对党的保证，这是在胜利鼓舞下对党的誓词，这誓词将保证扩军任务的全部胜利完成，使胜利来得更快。
