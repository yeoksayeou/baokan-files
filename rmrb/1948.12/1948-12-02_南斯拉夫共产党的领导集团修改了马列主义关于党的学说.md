The Leading Group of the Yugoslav Communist Party Modified the Marxist-Leninist Theory of the Party

Commentary from the organ of the Communist Information Bureau

(I)

In its resolution "On the Situation of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia," the Communist Information Bureau refuted the anti-Marxist-Leninist opportunist line of the current leadership of the CPY. This line is essentially a path to the destruction of the CPY.

The CPY leaders have revised the foundation of the Marxist-Leninist theory of the Party, whose invincible power has been proven in the experience of the international workers' movement for nearly a century. The CPY leaders have consistently pursued a policy of diminishing the role of the Party and dissolving it into a broad popular front comprising extremely complex class components. This damages the foundation of the Party, threatens its very existence, threatens its independence as a political force, and threatens its status as the highest organizational form and most important weapon of the working class in the struggle for socialism.

The CPY leaders, primarily Tito, Kardelj, Đilas, and Ranković, through their revisionist line on the Party, have placed the CPY in a semi-legal state. These leaders cultivate methods of military leadership within the Party, similar to those used by the Party's most vicious enemies, spies, and Trotskyites in the past. They attempt to establish a sectarian, bureaucratic organizational form and force the Party to implement a shameful system of terror, in which the basic rights of Party members are brutally deprived, and even slight criticism of incorrect leadership lines and methods is met with brutal repression.

The CPY leaders, tainted with aristocratic arrogance and complacency, have embarked on a path of estrangement from the socialist anti-imperialist united front, abandoning the internationalist traditions of Yugoslavia, betraying the cause of international proletarian solidarity, and moving towards nationalism.

Tito, Kardelj, Đilas, Ranković, and others, frightened by the blackmailing threats of imperialism, believe that making certain concessions to imperialism can win the favor of these countries and negotiate the independence of Yugoslavia with them. The CPY leaders, on the one hand, use the banner of left-leaning "revolution" to cover up their filth from populist, Menshevik, and Trotskyite positions; on the other hand, they attempt to force the masses to implement their adventurous program of building socialism with the help of imperialist countries, a program that is a sham. In reality, this "program" is a mask for abandoning socialism, leaving the communist united front, and moving towards capitalism.

(II)

This nationalist stance may cause Yugoslavia to degenerate into an ordinary bourgeois republic, lose its independence, and become a colony of imperialist countries (Resolution of the Information Bureau).

Everything has its own laws. After modifying the Marxist-Leninist theory of the Party and betraying the internationalist principles of communism, the CPY leaders have endangered the very existence of the CPY. Implementing this adventurism has created a real danger of degeneration for the People's Republic of Yugoslavia.

The theory that the Communist Party is the vanguard of the proletariat and the highest form of class organization is one of the most important foundations of Marxism-Leninism.

(III)

Marx and Engels taught us that the proletariat cannot seize proletarian power and solve the task of transforming capitalist society into socialist society without its own independent political party.

Lenin and Stalin advanced this principle of Marx and Engels and created a complete doctrine of the proletarian party, the party's organization, ideology, tactics, and theoretical foundations, adapted to the new historical era, the era of imperialism and proletarian revolution.

The Bolshevik organizational principles of the Leninist Party, this new type of party, were established in decades of stubborn struggle against opportunists, especially those who are opportunists on organizational issues.

Lenin and Stalin taught us that the Party is the vanguard of the working class, not equal to the entire class, let alone the entire people. To equate them would be to eliminate the boundary between the Party and non-Party members.

Marxist-Leninist theory holds that the Communist Party is the highest organizational form above all other organizations of the working people, that is, in the Soviet Union, the Party should be above the Soviets, and in Yugoslavia, the Party should be above the People's Front. The Party's superiority to all organizations of the working people is not only due to the fact that the Party concentrates the best elements of the working people, but also because the Party has its own special program and policies. All organizations of the workers can be led based on these programs and policies.

The situation in Yugoslavia is in direct violation of this program of Marxist-Leninist principles. They believe that the basic force in Yugoslavia is not the Communist Party, but the People's Front.

In his report to the Second Congress of the People's Front of Yugoslavia, Tito said: "Because the People's Front is not only the best form of political unity of all nationalities in our country, but also the best form of friendship and unity of all nationalities in our country in national relations. Therefore, no political party can replace this People's Front, so the People's Front should become a permanent national political organization."

In the regulations of the People's Front, the first item of the "Basic Organizational Principles of the People's Front of Yugoslavia" clearly states: "The People's Front of Yugoslavia is the basic political force."

It can be seen from this that the CPY leaders believe that the highest organizational form of the proletariat is not the Party, but the People's Front. In fact, the People's Front is gradually replacing the Communist Party of Yugoslavia, or rather, usurping the Communist Party of Yugoslavia. Its essence is to dissolve the Communist Party of Yugoslavia into the People's Front. Yugoslav political leaders (such as Tito, Kardelj, etc.) often mention only the People's Front in their published political speeches.

Of course, we do not doubt that the People's Front of Yugoslavia played a very positive role in the process of the Yugoslav people's resistance to the fascist occupiers in the Liberation War, nor do we doubt that the current People's Front can and should be an important means of uniting all democratic forces in Yugoslavia. However, the People's Front cannot replace the Communist Party, and it can only play its positive role under the leadership of the Communist Party. In reality, what is the People's Front of Yugoslavia like?

As everyone knows, the People's Front was formed under the leadership and initiation of the Communist Party even before Germany invaded Yugoslavia. The groups participating in the People's Front all came from the components of the old parties, as well as the upper echelons of the old parties. Participating in the People's Front alongside the Communist Party were: the Croatian Republican Peasant Party, the Serbian Bourgeois Republican Party, the Bourgeois Democratic Party and the Independent Democratic Party, the Serbian People's Peasant Party and the Agricultural League (these two parties merged into the Serbian Peasant Party after the war). In addition to political parties, many mass organizations also participated in the People's Front, such as the Youth Anti-Fascist League, the Yugoslav Trade Union, and the Women's Anti-Fascist Front.

It can be seen that the People's Front includes not only the Communist Party, but also bourgeois and petty-bourgeois parties, not only workers, but also rich peasants, merchants, and small factory owners.

Đilas said: "Participation in the People's Front is not restricted by any ideology, religion, or any other aspect." (Quoted from the Selected Works of the Information Bureau, page 93)

Regarding this People's Front, which includes extremely complex class components, as the basic force of national political leadership is a direct departure from the Marxist theory of class struggle and the Marxist-Leninist theory of the Party.

Comrade Stalin taught us: "The Party is not only the vanguard of the working class, but also the organized troops of the working class."

The Party Constitution clearly stipulates the Party's organs and organizational principles. Without these, the Party will inevitably degenerate into an arrogant, amorphous, disorganized "institution," and the boundary between the Party and the class will be eliminated. The Party Constitution stipulates the practical working methods of the Party organization, the organizational form of the Party, and the rules of Party life.

The CPY leaders' departure from the basic organizational principles of a Marxist revolutionary party is also manifested in the fact that if the People's Front of Yugoslavia has its own program and charter, the CPY itself does not have any program or charter. The CPY leaders working in this situation did not feel any shortcomings; and they enthusiastically turned this opportunism in program and organizational issues into a virtue, and even proved that the Communist Party does not need its own program.

At the Second Congress of the People's Front of Yugoslavia on September 27, 1947, Tito said: "Does the Communist Party of Yugoslavia have a more special program than the program of the People's Front? No, the Communist Party of Yugoslavia does not have another program, the program of the People's Front is the program of the Communist Party."

Kardelj, Secretary of the Central Committee of the CPY, also expressed this view on the program of the Communist Party and the People's Front at the Information Bureau meeting held in Poland. Đilas, Minister of Propaganda of the Central Committee of the CPY, also repeated Tito's opinion, believing that there is no difference between the program of the People's Front and the program of the Party.

If Đilas said in his report to the meeting of representatives of the Communist Information Bureau held in Poland in 1947 that the Communist Party of Yugoslavia "resolutely worked in accordance with the Bolshevik organizational principles at any time and under any conditions," then he was directly deceiving and lying to the face. In reality, the CPY leaders have moved further and further away from the principles of Marxism on organizational programs, and have degenerated into the position of Menshevik liquidators.

Lenin and Stalin taught us that the proletariat needs its own political party not only to seize power, but also to consolidate its power and defend the complete victory of socialism.

Comrade Stalin, when talking about the significance of consolidating and expanding the proletarian regime in the struggle for the complete victory of socialism, pointed out: "This means – to instill the spirit of discipline and organization into millions of proletarian masses, this means – to create a backbone and fortress among the proletarian masses that can prevent the corrosive influence of petty-bourgeois spontaneity and petty-bourgeois habits, this means, it is necessary to strengthen the work of the proletarian organizers in re-educating and transforming the petty bourgeoisie, this means, to help the proletarian masses to educate themselves into a force capable of eliminating classes and preparing conditions to organize socialist production. But to achieve all this, it is impossible without a powerful party that is united and disciplined."

The current opportunist line of the CPY leaders is gradually undermining the CPY's independence as a political force. Tito, Kardelj, Đilas, Ranković, and others are trying to put the CPY in a semi-legal position.

In Yugoslavia, many important resolutions on national political, economic, and ideological life are passed and announced to the people not in the name of the Communist Party, but in the name of the People's Front.

Until now, the Party organization has maintained a semi-legal status, whether it is the lower-level Party organization, the district committee, the provincial committee, or the central-level Party organization, they are all in a semi-legal position.

There is also a situation in the CPY, that is, Communist Party members must conceal their Party membership, and must appear in front of the masses as a member of a certain group of the People's Front. Many Party members said: "Communist Party members have no right to openly admit that they are Party members in their work, otherwise they will be punished by the Party."

In the large-scale factory "Lekayonik" in Belgrade (a well-known hardware factory in Yugoslavia - editor's note), more than 4,000 workers work there. According to the secretary of the Party organization, there are 160 Communist Party members in the factory. These Party members' meetings are held in secret, and no one is allowed to know the resolutions of these Party meetings. The resolutions of the Party meetings have never been published anywhere. The Communist Party members attending the meeting can only pass these resolutions through a certain appropriate organization, but cannot cite the Party's resolutions in any place. The workers in the factory do not know that they have their own Communist Party organization, and do not know that there are Communist Party members among the workers. Only a few workers are suspicious about this. The Party organization in the factory has never openly acted in front of the workers in its own name. Under this circumstance, the procedure for joining the Party is: the branch secretary secretly invites this worker or that worker to join the Party.

The district committees of the CPY exist in secret. They convene meetings in an extremely secret manner and never publish the resolutions of the district committee meetings to non-Party members in any way. The staff of the district committee have never worked in front of the non-Party masses in the name of the district committee.

The Central Committee of the CPY also does not work like a central leading organ of the Party. The plenary sessions of the Central Committee are never convened. All principled issues of Party life are decided in a small circle of several leaders (Tito, Kardelj, Ranković, Đilas, and others). There is no concrete leadership and no absorption of a broad range of Party activists to participate in solving the Party's tasks.

From the establishment of the new Yugoslavia to the present, neither the Central Committee of the CPY nor the grassroots organizations of the Party have published any Party resolutions.

The CPY's organ, "Borba" (Combat), has completely not published any articles on Party life. Strangely enough, "Borba" has almost completely not published any communications, papers, and news about Party life, Party meetings, plenary sessions of the Central Committee, meetings of Party activists, and the work of grassroots Party organizations for such a long time as 1947-48 until now. During this period, none of the Party leaders have published articles on Party life in the Party's organ. In the editorial column of the Party newspaper, articles on various issues are often published, but they have never even hinted at the role of Communist Party members in solving national tasks, and have never raised the tasks undertaken by the Party organization. They have never called on Communist Party members to become organizers and vanguards in implementing government policies.

Until now, the Communist Party of Yugoslavia actually works in an illegal secret way. CPY members are forced to hide their Party membership, that is, the pride and happiness of every soldier fighting for the cause of communism - the noblest title of Communist Party member must be hidden. In the democratic republic of Yugoslavia, such a title is absolutely secret.

Under the existing conditions in Yugoslavia where the Communist Party is the ruling party, it is absolutely wrong and politically harmful to the Party to completely hide the Party from the people. In order to cover up their liquidationist line on Party issues, the CPY leaders fabricated many false arguments. They said that they hide the leading role of the Communist Party from the people in order to remove the excuse for other parties besides the CPY to develop their forces and conduct struggles. Tito and Kardelj wanted to use this worthless cunning means to change the laws of historical development and deceive the class.

However, it is the most ridiculous idea to think that this worthless slippery method can stop the class enemy from fighting. In reality, the leaders of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia, by hiding the banner of the Party from the people, only reduced the role of the Party, dulled the weapons of the working class, and disarmed the working class.

Because the current CPY leaders have departed from the principles of internationalism and embarked on the path of nationalism, fearing the reasonable resentment generated by the broad masses of Party members and the people, they have formed a shameful, purely Turkish-style system of terror within the Party.

The Communist Party of Yugoslavia has formed a sectarian, bureaucratic organizational form. Most of the members of the Central Committee of the CPY are not elected, but recommended. They have cancelled all possibilities for Communist Party members to conduct political activities openly and to openly propagate the Party's views to the masses. In the life of the CPY, Tito, Kardelj, Đilas, Ranković, and others have deliberately and wantonly deprived the most basic rights of inner-Party democracy. Without elections, without criticism and self-criticism, they have created a bureaucratic system within the Party that is fatally harmful to the survival and development of the CPY.

The leaders of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia do not consider the Party to be the highest form of unity, the independent fighting organization of the working class, an organization based on inner-Party democracy, criticism and self-criticism, in which every Party member has the right to express their opinions; but they consider the Party to be a guerrilla force, in which Party members have no right to discuss any issues within the Party, but should only be obedient and unquestioningly execute all the intentions and instructions of their "chief." After the CPY leaders cultivated methods of military leadership within the Party and cancelled the Marxist foundation of Party building - the basic principles of inner-Party democracy, they were actually attempting to adopt military bureaucratic methods, just like the "bureaucratic patriarch," traitor, Trotsky, who had been negated and defeated by Bolshevism, wanted to use in the Bolshevik Party.

This destruction of inner-Party democracy, this suppression of criticism and self-criticism, has led to cadres' alienation from the Party masses, and has led to bureaucracy and the binding of the Party organization's initiative. Party members are afraid to express their opinions, dare not criticize the shortcomings within the Party, and remain silent to avoid being suppressed.

The horrific fact that Central Committee members of the CPY, Yuyovic and Haidran, were expelled from the Party and arrested for daring to criticize the anti-Soviet stance of the CPY leaders and advocating Soviet-Yugoslav friendship is the best example of the implementation of the system of terror in Yugoslavia.

The shameful system of terrorism cultivated by the CPY leaders within the Party is the biggest obstacle to their correction of the errors they have committed in basic issues of internal and external policy that deviate from Marxism-Leninism. The Communist Information Bureau pointed out: "The very existence and development of Yugoslavia require the elimination of this system."

Yugoslavia is laying the foundation for the socialist path. Huge and complex tasks are placed before the working class: to transform the Yugoslav economy according to socialist methods, to overcome Yugoslavia's technological backwardness, to develop socialist industry, to eradicate capitalist components, and to carry out the socialist transformation of the private peasant economy - all of these require the working class, as the leading force in Yugoslavia, to make a high degree of use of its material and spiritual forces. It is extremely muddled to think that these tasks can be solved without class struggle, and that the transition to socialism can be achieved peacefully, smoothly, and properly without overcoming difficulties and contradictions. The Yugoslav leaders also deny the growth of domestic capitalism from an opportunist point of view, and the resulting intensification of class struggle in the Yugoslav countryside.

The foremost condition for the victorious solution of these tasks is to strengthen the organizational life and ideological training of the CPY, and to make the Party the leading and inspiring force in socialist construction.

Eliminating the system of terrorism within the Party, and sectarian bureaucratic habits in organizational work, making the Party completely open, restoring the Party's leading role, strengthening the Party's group meetings and congresses, and promoting the enthusiasm, initiative, and creativity of Party members to make Party life sound, and developing inner-Party democracy, criticism and self-criticism are the primary tasks in the current life of the CPY.

The CPY leaders, who have undermined the internationalist tradition of the CPY and embarked on the path of nationalism, clearly attempted to create a disguised appearance with adventurous emergency measures, as if the leadership group of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia was observing the principles of inner-Party democracy. In this way, they hurriedly convened the Fifth Congress of the CPY without the necessary, solemn, and careful preparations. They drafted the Party Program and Party Constitution as if they had a fever, and announced the adventurous decrees and declarations that would eliminate capitalist components and the system of exploitation of man by man in Yugoslavia within a few days. The purpose of their use of such emergency measures was to convene the congress of the whole Party rapidly without true inner-Party democracy and self-criticism, so that the congress could approve the opportunist line in the current CPY leadership.

The incorrect line of the CPY leadership on basic issues of domestic and foreign policy actually threatens the survival of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia and creates the danger of the degeneration of the Democratic Republic of Yugoslavia.

However, within the CPY, there are fully sound forces that are loyal to Marxism-Leninism, loyal to the internationalist traditions of the CPY, and loyal to the socialist united front.

(IV)

The resolution of the Communist Information Bureau pointed out that "The task of these sound forces of the CPY is to force today's leaders to openly and sincerely admit their mistakes, correct these mistakes, break away from nationalism, return to the socialist side, and consolidate the united anti-imperialist socialist united front by all means, or, if the current leaders of the CPY show that they do not have this ability, they should be replaced and a new internationalist leading organ of the CPY should be elected."

Undoubtedly, the CPY has its glorious fighting traditions. There must be forces within the CPY that can eliminate the system of terror within the Party, resist the CPY leaders who have deviated from Marxism-Leninism, and there must be forces that can lead the working masses of Yugoslavia to fight for the victory of socialism under the great banner of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, with the support of the Communist Parties of other countries.

### 南斯拉夫共产党的领导集团修改了马列主义关于党的学说

　　南斯拉夫共产党的领导集团修改了马列主义关于党的学说
    共产党情报局机关刊专论
    （一）
    共产党情报局在“关于南斯拉夫共产党状况”的决议中，批驳了目前南共领导集团之反马列主义的机会主义路线。这个路线实质上是使南斯拉夫共产党走向毁灭的路线。
    南共领导者修改了马列主义关于党的学说之基础，这个学说的无敌的力量，已在近百年来国际工人运动的经验中得到了证明。南共领导者一贯的进行着降低党的作用，使党溶化在包括极复杂的阶级成份的广大非党人民阵线里的方针。这就损害了党的基础，威胁着党本身的生存，威胁着党之成为独立的政治力量，威胁着党之成为工人阶级在社会主义斗争中的最高的组织形式及最重要的武器。
    南共领导者，首先就是铁托、卡德尔、德热拉斯、兰科维奇，对党的问题的取消主义的路线，使得南共党处于半合法的状态。这些领导者们在党内养成军事领导的方法。就象以前党的最凶恶的敌人、间谍、托洛茨基所用的领导方法一样。他们企图建立一个宗派主义官僚主义式的组织形式，并迫使党实施一种可耻的恐怖制度，在这种情形下，党员的起码权利都被蛮横的剥夺了，对不正确的领导路线及领导方法稍加批评，就遭受到残酷的镇压。
    沾染了贵族式的傲慢、自大习气的南共领导者们，已走上了脱离社会主义反帝统一战线的道路，离开了南斯拉夫国际主义的传统，叛变了劳动者国际国结的事业，并走向民族主义的道路。
    被帝国主义的流氓敲诈性的威胁吓慌了的铁托、卡德尔、德热拉斯、兰科维奇等，以为向帝国主义作某些让步就可以取得这些国家的欢心，就可与他们谈好南斯拉夫的独立问题。南共领导者一面用左倾的“革命”旗帜遮掩起他们从民粹主义、孟什维克、托洛茨基等立场出发的滥脏货；一面又企图强迫人民群众实行其在帝国主义国家帮助下的社会主义建设的假牌的冒险主义纲领。实际上这个“纲领”就是脱离社会主义，离开共产主义统一战线，和走向资本主义的假面具。
    （二）
    这种民族主义的立场，可能使南斯拉夫蜕化为一般的资产阶级的共和国，丧失南斯拉夫的独立，变南斯拉夫为帝国主义国家的殖民地。（情报局决议）
    一切事物都有其自身的规律，南共领导者修改了马列主义关于党的学说，叛变了共产主义的国际主义原则之后，就危害了南共本身的生存，实行这种冒险主义，就造成了使南斯拉夫人民共和国蜕化的实际危险。
    关于共产党是无产阶级的先锋队，是阶级组织的最高形式这一学说，是马列主义最重要的基础之一。
    （三）
    马克思、恩格斯教导我们说，无产阶级没有自己的独立的政党，就不能掌握无产阶级政权，和解决改造资本主义社会为社会主义社会的任务。
    列宁、斯大林向前发展了马克思、恩格斯这一原理，并创造了适应于新的历史时代的、适应于帝国主义和无产阶级革命时代的无产阶级党、党的组织、思想、策略、理论基础的完整学说。
    列宁主义的党，这一新型政党的布尔什维主义之组织原则，乃是在与机会主义者、尤其是在与组织问题上的机会主义者进行数十年顽强斗争中创立起来的。
    列宁和斯大林教育我们说：党是工人阶级的先锋队，它不等于整个阶级，更不等于全体人民。如果把它们等量齐观，那就是取消了党和非党的界限。
    马列主义理论认为：共产党乃是高于劳动人民其它一切组织的最高组织形式，也就是说，在苏联，党应该高于苏维埃，在南斯拉夫，党应该高于人民阵线。党的高于劳动人民一切组织，不仅仅由于党内集中了劳动人民中的最优秀的分子，而且还由于党有其特殊的纲领和政策。可以依据这些纲领政策来领导劳动者的一切组织。
    南斯拉夫的情况却与马列主义这一纲领的原理正相违反，他们认为南斯拉夫的基本力量，不是共产党，而是人民阵线。
    铁托在南斯拉夫人民阵线第二次代表大会上的报告中说：因为人民阵线不仅是我国各族人民政治上团结的最好形式，而且是我国各族人民在民族关系上友爱和团结的最好形式。所以无论何种政党也不能代替这个人民阵线，因此人民阵线应成为一个永久的全民政治组织。
    在人民阵线规章“南斯拉夫人民阵线基本组织原则”第一项内，就开宗明义的指出：“南斯拉夫人民阵线是基本的政治力量。”
    由此可见，南共领导者认为：无产阶级最高组织形式不是党，而是人民阵线，而实际上人民阵线正在逐渐地代替着南斯拉夫共产党，更确切的说是在篡夺着南斯拉夫共产党。其本质是使南斯拉夫共产党溶化在人民阵线里。南斯拉夫政治领导者（如铁托、卡德尔等）在他们所公布的政治性的发言里，经常提到的仅仅是人民阵线。
    当然，我们并不怀疑，南斯拉夫人民阵线在南斯拉夫人民反抗法西斯占领者的解放战争过程里曾起了极大的积极作用，我们也不怀疑目前人民阵线能是，而且应当是联合南国一切民主力量的重要手段。然而，人民阵线不能够代替共产党，而且只有在共产党领导下才能发挥它的积极作用。实际上，南斯拉夫人民阵线是怎样的呢？
    大家知道，还在德国进攻南斯拉夫以前，就在共产党的领导和发起之下组成了人民阵线，参加人民阵线的各个团体，都是来自旧政党的成份，以及旧政党中的上层分子。与共产党平排参加人民阵线的有：霍尔瓦特共和农民党，塞尔维亚资产阶级共和党，资产阶级民主党和独立民主党，塞尔维亚人民农民党和农业同盟（这两个党在战后已合并为塞尔维亚农民党）。除了政党之外，还有很多群众性的组织也参加到人民阵线里去，例如青年反法西斯同盟，南斯拉夫职工会，和妇女反法西斯阵线。
    可见，人民阵线所包括的不仅是共产党，还有资产阶级和小资产阶级政党，不仅是劳动者，还有富农、商人和小工厂主。
    德热拉斯曾说：“参加人民阵线不受任何思想、宗教、以及其他任何方面的限制。”（引自情报局选集九十三页）
    把这种包括极复杂阶级成份的人民阵线视为南国政治领导的基本力量，这就是直接脱离了马克思主义阶级斗争的理论和马列主义论党的学说。
    斯大林同志教导我们说：“党不仅是工人阶级的先锋队，而且是工人阶级有组织的部队。”
    党章里曾清楚的规定了党的机构和党的组织原则，没有这些，党就不可免的要更化为傲漫的、不定型的、无组织的“机构”，就取消了党和阶级的界限，党章规定了党组织的实际工作方法、党的组织形式、以及党内生活的规则。
    南共领导者脱离了马克思革命政党的基本组织原则，也表现在这样一件事实上，即是说：如果南斯拉夫人民阵线有自己的纲领和章程，则南共党却反而没有任何纲领、章程。而在这种情形下工作的南共领导者，却没有感到任何缺憾；且还热心地把这种纲领与组织问题上的机会主义变成一种美德，甚至，还证明了：共产党不需要自己的纲领。
    在一九四七年九月二十七日南斯拉夫人民阵线第二次代表大会上，铁托说道：“南斯拉夫共产党有没有比人民阵线纲领更特殊的纲领呢？没有的，南斯拉夫共产党没有另外的纲领，人民阵线的纲领，就是共产党的纲领。”
    南共中央委员会书记卡德尔在波兰举行的情报局会议上，也发表了这样的关于共产党和人民阵线纲领的观点。南共中央宣传部长德热拉斯也重复着铁托的意见，认为人民阵线纲领和党的纲领之间没有任何区别。
    如果，德热拉斯曾在一九四七年在波兰举行的共产党情报局代表会议的报告中说：南斯拉夫共产党“任何时候，任何条件下都坚决依据着布尔什维克的组织原则进行工作”，那他就是直接欺骗和当面造谣。实际上，南共领导者已在组织纲领问题上，越来越远的离开了马克思主义的原则，已蜕化为孟什维克取消派的立场。
    列宁、斯大林教导我们：无产阶级之所以需要自己的政党、不仅是为了取得政权，而且还为了巩固自己的政权，和保卫社会主义的彻底胜利。
    斯大林同志说到巩固和扩大无产阶级政权在争取社会主义彻底胜利中的意义时，曾指出：“这就是说——要向千百万无产阶级群众灌输纪律精神和组织精神，这就是说——要在无产阶级群众中间，造成能防范小资产阶级自发性和小资产阶级习惯势力腐蚀影响的一种骨干和堡垒，这就是说，需要加强无产阶级在重新教育和改造小资产阶级方面的组织者工作，这就是说，要帮助无产阶级群众把自己教育成为能够消灭阶级并准备条件来组织社会主义生产的力量。可是要做到这一切，没有本身具备团结性和纪律性而强有力的党是不可能的”。
    目前南共领导者的机会主义路线，使得南共逐渐地破坏自己之成为独立的政治力量。铁托、卡德尔、德热拉斯、兰科维奇等力图使南共陷于半合法的地位。
    在南斯拉夫，许多有关国家政治经济、思想生活等问题的重要决议的通过，及向人民公布，不是用共产党的名义，而是用人民阵线的名义。
    直到现在，党的组织还保持着半合法的状态，无论是下级党的组织、区委、省委以及中央一级党的组织，都处于半合法的地位。
    南共还存在这种情况，即是共产党员必须掩盖自己的党员面目，必须以人民阵线的某一团体的一分子出现在群众面前，很多党员说：“共产党员在工作中没有权利公开承认自己是党员，否则就要受到党的处分。”
    在贝尔格莱德的大规模工厂“列药尼克”厂（是南斯拉夫有名的五金工厂——编者注）里，有四千以上的工人在那里工作。据党组织的书记谈，厂中有一百六十个共产党员，这种党员的党的会议是秘密召开的，在这些党的会议上的决议是任何人不许知道的，党的会议的决议在任何地方都没有公布过。与会的共产党员只能在某适当的组织内把这些决议通过一遍，但却不能在任何场所引证党的决议。工厂里的工人都不知道他们有自己的共产党的组织，不知道工人中间有共产党员。关于这件事只有某几个工人在猜疑而已。工厂里的党的组织从未用自己的名义在工人面前公开活动。在这种情形下，入党的手续是：由支部书记秘密地聘请这一工人或那一工人入党。
    南共的区党委是秘密存在的，他们都采取极端秘密的方式召集会议，从来没有以任何一种方式向非党员公布过区党委会议的决议。区党委的工作人员从来也没有用过区党委的名义在非党群众面前进行工作。
    南共中央委员会也同样地没有象一个党的中央领导机关那样进行工作，党的中央全会从不召开，一切党内生活的原则问题，是在几个领导者（铁托、卡德尔、兰科维奇、德热拉斯诸人）的狭小范围里决定。没有具体领导，没有吸收广大的党的积极分子去参加解决党的任务。
    从新南斯拉夫成立到现在这个期间内，上自南共中央委员会，下至党的基层组织，从未公布过任何一个党的决议。
    南斯拉夫共产党的机关报“战斗报”完全没有发表过关于党的生活的文章，奇怪得很，“战斗报”在一九四七年——四八年这样长的时间以来，直到现在为止，几乎完全没有登载过有关党的生活，党的会议，中央全会，党的积极分子会议以及有关基层党组织工作的任何一个通讯、论文和消息。在这个期间内，任何一个党的领导者，没有在党的机关报上发表过有关党的生活的文章。在党报的社论栏里，经常登载的是各种各样问题的论文，然而却从来连暗示一下共产党员在解决国家任务中的作用这样的事都没有过，从未提出过党的组织所担负的任务。更从来没有号召共产党员成为执行政府政策中的组织者和先锋队。
    直到目前为止，南斯拉夫共产党实际上是用不合法的秘密方法来进行工作的。南共党员被迫隐藏起自己的党员面目，这就是说，每一个为共产主义事业而奋斗的战士的自豪和幸福——共产党员这个最高尚的称号都必须隐藏起来。在南斯拉夫民主共和国，这样的称号是绝对秘密的。
    在共产党已是执政党的南斯拉夫的现存条件下，在人民面前，把党完全秘密起来，这是绝对的错误的，是对党有政治危害的。南共领导者为了掩盖自己对党的问题上的取消派路线，他们制造了许多虚伪的论据，他们说，他们之向人民掩蔽共产党的领导作用，是为了去掉南共以外的其他党派发展力量和进行斗争的借口，铁托、卡德尔想以这种一文不值的狡猾手段来改变历史发展的规律，来欺骗阶级。
    然而，如果认为这种一文不值的滑头办法，可以使阶级敌人停止斗争，这是最可笑的想法。实际上，南斯拉夫共产党的领导者，在人民面前隐藏党的旗帜，仅只是降低了党的作用，迟钝了工人阶级的武器，解除了工人阶级的武装。
    由于目前南共领导者脱离了国际主义的原则，走向民族主义道路，害怕广大的党员群众和人民群众所产生的合理的愤恨情绪，他们就在党内形成了可耻的，纯粹土耳其式的恐怖制度。
    南斯拉夫共产党形成了宗派主义、官僚主义的组织形式，南共中央的大多数委员不是选举的，而是推荐的，他们取消了共产党员公开做政治活动，及公开向群众宣传党的观点的一切可能。在南共党的生活里，铁托、卡德尔、德热拉斯、兰科维奇等处心积虑地、蛮横地、剥夺了党内民主的最起码的权利。没有选举，没有批评和自我批评，在党内造成了对南共生存和发展有致命危害的官僚主义制度。
    南斯拉夫共产党的领导者，不认为党是团结的最高形式，是工人阶级独立战斗的组织，这个组织是建立在党内民主、批评和自我批评的基础之上的，在这个组织里，每个党员都有权发表自己的意见；而认为党是游击性的队伍，党员无权讨论党内任何问题，只应当是俯首贴耳，毫无异议的执行着自己“首长”的一切意图和指令。南共领导者在党内养成军事领导的方法，和取消了马克思主义的建党基础——党内民主基本原则之后，就在实际上企图采用军事官僚主义的办法，如象已被布尔什维克主义否定和击溃了的“官僚主义家长”、叛徒、托洛茨基想在布尔什维克党内使用的办法一样。
    这种对党内民主的摧残，对批评和自我批评的镇压，就使得干部脱离了党员群众，走向官僚主义和束缚党组织的积极性的道路。党员都害怕发表自己的意见，不敢对党内缺点进行批评，都保持着缄默态度，以免遭受到镇压。
    南共中央委员尤约维奇和海德兰两同志因为敢于批评南共领导者的反苏立场和主张南苏友好就被开除出党和遭到逮捕，这种骇人听闻的事便是南斯拉夫实行恐怖制度的最好例证。　
    南共领导者在党内所养成的可耻的恐怖主义的制度，就是他们对自己在内外政策基本问题上所犯的脱离马列主义的错误进行改正中之最大障碍，共产党情报局指出：“南斯拉夫本身的存在和发展都要求消灭此种制度。”
    南斯拉夫正在奠定着社会主义道路过程的基础。在工人阶级面前，摆着巨大而繁杂的任务：按社会主义方法改造南斯拉夫经济，克服南斯拉夫技术上的落后性，发展社会主义工业，根除资本主义成份，对私有财产的农民经济进行社会主义的改造——所有这些都要求作为南斯拉夫领导力量的工人阶级，高度的运用自己的物质力量和精神力量，如果认为不进行阶级斗争可以解决这些任务，不克服困难和矛盾也可以和平地、一帆风顺地、妥妥稳稳地过渡到社会主义，这种想法是极端糊涂的。南斯拉夫领导者还从机会主义观点出发，否认本国资本主义的成长，和由此产生的南斯拉夫农村中阶级斗争日趋尖锐化。
    胜利解决这些任务的最先决的条件，就是要加强南共党的组织生活和思想锻炼，使党成为社会主义建设中的领导力量和鼓舞力量。
    消灭党内恐怖主义制度，和组织中工作中的宗派主义官僚主义习气，全部公开党，恢复党的领导作用，加强党的小组会、代表大会，和发扬党员的积极性、自动性和创造性等办法来使党的生活健全起来，发展党内民主，批评与自我批评，是南共党目前生活中的首要任务。
    南共党领导者，破坏了南共的国际主义的传统，走上了民族主义的道路，明显地企图以冒险主义的非常手段形成一种伪装的面貌，似乎南斯拉夫共产党的领导集团是遵守党内民主制的原则的，这样他们就匆匆忙忙没有进行必须的、郑重其事的和仔细的准备工作就召开了南共第五次代表大会，他们就象发寒热病似的，草草写成党纲、党章，就公布了使南斯拉夫在几天之内消灭资本主义成份和人剥削人制度的冒险主义法令和宣言。他们之所以用这种非常手段，其目的是想在没有真正党内民主和自我批评的条件下，来迅雷不及掩耳地召集全党代表大会，使大会批准目前南共领导上的机会主义路线。
    南共领导在对内对外政策的基本问题上的不正确路线，实际地威胁着南斯拉夫共产党的生存，造成使南斯拉夫民主共和国有蜕化的危险性。
    然而，在南共内部具有着忠实于马列主义的、忠实于南共国际主义传统的、忠实于社会主义统一阵线的充分健全的力量。
    （四）
    共产党情报局决议中指出，“南共这些健全力量的任务，就是要强迫今天的领导者，公开地诚恳地承认自己的错误，改正这些错误，脱离民族主义，回到社会主义方面来，并以一切办法巩固统一的反帝社会主义统一战线，或者，如果南共现在的领导者表现得没有这种能力，就要掉换他们，并推选新的南共国际主义的领导机关。”
    无疑地，南共是有其光荣的斗争传统的。南共党内一定会有能够消灭党内恐怖制度，反抗脱离了马列主义的南共领导者的力量，一定会有能够在伟大的马、恩、列、斯旗帜下，在别国共产党的支持下，领导南斯拉夫劳动群众去为社会主义胜利进行斗争的力量。（叶群译）
