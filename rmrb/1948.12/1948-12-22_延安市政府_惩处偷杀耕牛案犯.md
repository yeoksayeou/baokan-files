　　Yan'an Municipal Government
    Punishes Culprits in Cattle Slaughter Case
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 20th] The Yan'an Municipal Government has legally punished individual personnel from government organs and schools, as well as individual butchers, who violated the decree prohibiting the slaughter of draft cattle. From November 23rd to December 6th, a period of 13 days, the Municipal Public Security Bureau discovered that the general affairs staff of the Grass Seed Distillery, Yan'an University, and the Veterans Sanatorium, along with butcher Yang Zhengrong and others, had illegally slaughtered seven heads of draft cattle. In addition to the confiscation of the slaughtered cattle according to the law, the violators are being punished according to the severity of their offenses. The Grass Seed Distillery case has already been adjudicated, and the deputy manager of the factory has been sentenced to seven days of forced labor. These cases all occurred after the Municipal Government re-emphasized the decree prohibiting the slaughter of draft cattle on November 15th. The Municipal Government's re-emphasis of the ban is due to the increasing number of violations of the prohibition against slaughtering draft cattle in the city recently. In the southern districts of the city alone, half of the eighteen cattle slaughtered in the first half of November were healthy cattle suitable for plowing.

    惩处偷杀耕牛案犯
    【新华社延安二十日电】延安市政府依法惩处违犯禁宰耕牛法令偷杀耕牛之个别机关学校人员及个别屠户。自上月二十三日至本月六日之十三日间，市公安局查获草籽酒厂、延安大学、荣誉军人疗养院的总务工作人员及屠户杨正荣等违法偷杀耕牛七头，除已依法没收其已宰杀之耕牛外，并正按情节轻重分别对违法者予以处分。草籽酒厂一案已告判决，该厂副经理被罚处劳役七天。这些案件都是在市政府于上月十五日重申禁宰耕牛法令后发生的。市政府之重申禁令，系于近来本市违禁宰杀耕牛事件日多。仅本市南区各地，在十一月份上半月内宰杀之十八头牛中有半数为可以耕作之健牛。
