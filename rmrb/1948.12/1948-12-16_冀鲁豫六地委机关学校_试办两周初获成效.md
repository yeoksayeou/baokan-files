　　Jilu Yu No. 6 Prefectural Committee Organ School
  　Achieves Initial Success After Two Weeks of Trial Operation
    [Jilu Yu Telegram] In order to improve the cultural and political level (mainly cultural) of in-service cadres and miscellaneous staff in the organs, the Jilu Yu No. 6 Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China decided to trial-run a regular organ school. According to the existing level of most personnel in the organs, it was divided into primary and advanced classes, which officially started on the 11th of last month. Various school regulations were also formulated: (1) Regardless of the rank of cadres or miscellaneous staff, all those whose cultural level is below junior high school level must participate in the organ school. (2) After enrollment, all learning-related matters must be subject to the leadership of the school and abide by all rules. (3) Regarding the school system, it is stipulated that primary school will be two years and senior primary school will be one year. The courses of four years of primary school and two years of senior primary school will be completed within the stipulated time. The main courses are the same as those of regular schools. Enrollment requires examination and class placement. Those who pass the examination at the end of the study period will be issued a certificate by the organ school. The examination system is the same as that of regular schools. Classes are taught for two hours a day, and twenty weeks constitute one semester. (4) Regarding teachers, cadres in the organ who are capable of serving as primary or senior primary school teachers will be hired by the school affairs office. Due to the limitation of school buildings and teachers, primary and senior classes are separated, and primary schools adopt a compound teaching method. After two weeks of trial operation, the results have been quite smooth, and the learning enthusiasm of all students is extremely high. Although work is busy, they still seize the time to review their lessons. Because the students are all adults, they have strong comprehension and can learn consciously. Therefore, in the two weeks of study, there have been achievements. Those who did not know a single character in the past can now recognize more than 40 characters and can write and speak them. The current special commissioner's office has also decided to set up an organ school. Because the residence is very close to the prefectural committee's office, it is planned that the two organs will run it jointly, so that the problem of teachers and school buildings will be better solved.

　　冀鲁豫六地委机关学校
  　试办两周初获成效
    【冀鲁豫电】中共冀鲁豫区六地委会为了提高机关在职干部及杂务人员的文化、政治水平（以文化为主），确定试办正规机关学校。根据机关多数人员的现有水平，共分初、高两班，于上月十一日已正式开课。并规定了学校的各种制度：（一）不论何级干部或杂务人员，凡文化程度不及初中程度的，一律参加机关学校。（二）入学后一切有关学习问题，均须服从校部领导，并遵守一切规则。（三）学制问题，规定初小二年，高小一年。在规定的时间内，将初小四年高小二年之课程学完。主要课程与正规学校同。入校须经考试、编班，学习期满及格者，由机关学校发给证明书。考试制度与正规学校同。每日授课两小时，二十周为一学期。（四）教员问题，由校务处聘请本机关能够充任初小或高小教员的干部充任。因校舍及教员限制，初、高分班，初小采取复式教学法。经过两周的试办，结果进行相当顺利，全体学员学习情绪极为高涨。工作虽忙，但还抓紧时间复习功课。因学生均系成年，理解力较强，且能自觉学习，因而在两周的学习中，已有成效，过去一字不识的，现已认识四十多个字，并会写会讲。现专署机关亦确定办机关学校，因住处离地委机关很近，因此打算两个机关合办，这样教员及校舍问题都将更好解决。
