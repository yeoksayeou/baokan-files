　　North China Government Uniformly Stipulates Middle School Political Curriculum Standards
    [This Newspaper] The North China People's Government issued instructions to governments at all levels on the sixth of this month, stipulating the curriculum standards for political classes in secondary schools. The instructions stated: Political class in secondary schools is the main course for guiding students' thinking and improving their political understanding and theoretical knowledge. In the past, there were no unified curriculum standards, so the teaching in various schools was extremely inconsistent. Now, in order to make this political and ideological education more effective, the following points are specifically stipulated:
    1.  The subjects, progress, and main reference books for political classes in secondary schools have been determined, and textbooks are being compiled. Before these textbooks are issued and applied, all secondary schools shall compile temporary handouts according to the stipulated subjects and progress, referring to the designated reference book list, for teaching purposes. However, one-year secondary schools and normal schools may conduct simplified versions of the prescribed junior high school political subjects. The aim is to enable students to have a preliminary understanding of the basic problems of the Chinese revolution and the laws of social development. The aforementioned political subjects, progress, and main reference book lists are issued with the instructions.
    2.  In order to teach political classes well, carefully selecting political teachers is a decisive link. Therefore, it is necessary to: (1) select more progressive and reputable people among the teachers to take on this course. The principal and the director of teaching affairs should try to teach one or two political classes. (2) The director of teaching affairs or the deputy director of teaching affairs should lead and organize political teachers into business research groups to conduct research on teaching materials and methods. (3) This winter vacation, political teachers should be gathered for business learning, divided by administrative regions or unified, and examinations must be conducted. This can be set as a routine from now on. Such learning can be organized every long holiday. Teachers who teach other courses should also be organized in this way, so that they can be proficient in the courses they teach and improve teaching efficiency.
    3.  The implementation of political education and ideological education, in addition to the political classes prescribed in the curriculum, the study of current events and the organization of appropriate extracurricular activities are also important methods. Therefore: (1) Periodically or when there are major changes in the situation, organize specialists to report on current events, and hold one or two current affairs tests each semester. (2) School libraries should add newspapers, magazines, and books on politics, economics, revolutionary literature and art, science, etc., within their financial means to suit students' reading, and encourage and guide students' extracurricular reading. (3) Student activities within the school should be carried out with more guidance; and students should be led to appropriately participate in political activities such as mass movements, social services, and social investigations outside the school, so that students can gain political awareness, ideological style, and work ability in practical actions. This must be carried out in accordance with the time stipulated in the draft interim implementation measures for secondary schools and normal schools, avoiding the two tendencies of being too heavy or moving towards cancellation. It is hoped that the above instructions will be studied and implemented immediately; and the research opinions, problems encountered in the implementation, and experiences gained will be reported to this government at any time.

　　华北政府统一规定中学政治课程标准
    【本报讯】华北人民政府于本月六日向各级政府发出指示，规定了中等学校政治课课程标准。指示称：中等学校的政治课，系指导学生思想，提高政治认识与理论知识的主要课程。过去未有统一的课程标准，因此，各校教学极不一致，现在为使这一政治思想教育更有效的进行，特作如下几点规定：
    一、中等学校政治课课目、进度及主要参考书已经确定，课本正进行编辑。在此种课本未颁发应用以前，各中等学校一律根据所规定之课目、进度，参照指定之参考书目，编印临时讲义，进行教学。但一年制的中学、师范，可根据所定初中政治课课目简要进行。目的要使对中国革命的基本问题与社会发展规律有一个初步认识。上述政治课课目，进度及主要参考书目，随指示颁发。
    二、为教好政治课，慎选政治教员是个决定的环节。因此必须：（一）遴选教员中比较进步的有威信的人来担任这门课。校长、教导主任均应尽量教一两班政治课。（二）政治教员由教导主任或副教导主任领导组织业务研究小组，进行教材与教法的研究。（三）今年寒假，以行署区为单位，分区或统一集合政治教员进行业务学习，并须进行考试。此后可以定为常规。每逢较长假期，均可组织这种学习。担任其它课程之教员，亦应如此组织，使能精通所任课程，提高了教学效率。
    三、政治教育、思想教育之实施，除进行课程表所定之政治课外，时事学习与组织适当之课外活动，也是其重要方法。因此：（一）定期或于有重大的形势变化时，组织专人报告时事，每学期可举行一两次时事测验。（二）学校图书馆应尽经费能力所及，添设适合学生阅读之报纸、杂志以及政治、经济、革命文艺、科学等书籍，提倡与指导学生课外阅读。（三）学生校内活动应该更有指导的进行；并应领导学生适当的参加校外群众运动、社会服务、社会调查等政治活动，要使学生在实际行动中获得政治认识、思想作风、工作能力等各方面的锻炼。对这一点，必须按照中学、师范暂行实施办法草案所规定的时间来进行，避免过重，或走向取消的两种倾向。以上指示，希立即研究执行；并将研究意见及执行中发生的问题与取得的经验，随时报告本府。
    附：中等学校政治课课目进度及主要参考书：
    （一）初中：
    一年级：上学期课目：中国现状。参考书：（一）四大家族。（二）人民公敌蒋介石。（三）现代中国的两种社会。下学期课目：中国革命。参考书：（一）中国革命与中国共产党。（二）新民主主义论。（三）论联合政府。（四）目前形势与我们的任务。

    三年级：上学期课目：新民主主义论。参考书：同初中一年级下学期中国革命的参考书。下学期课目：政治常识。本年度以一九四八年目前形势与我们的任务标准本为读本，明年另定。
