The vessels will be transferred in five batches, starting on January 15, 1949. In accordance with the principles of the Italian reparations draft confirmed by the final agreement, the Soviet Union accepts all Italian assets in Romania, Bulgaria, and Hungary as compensation. The portion of the 100 million US dollars in reparations owed to the Soviet Union that is not covered by the aforementioned assets will be paid in kind from Italy's current production. A three-year trade agreement and payment agreement were signed on the same day. The trade agreement stipulates a normal exchange of goods plan between the Soviet Union and Italy, with an annual total value of approximately 30 billion Italian lire. The Soviet Union will supply mainly agricultural products and raw materials, including primarily grains, metal ores, timber, and natural fertilizers, while Italy will supply manufactured goods (machinery, ships, textiles, and chemicals), sulfur, mercury, etc. In addition, the agreement also stipulates a special plan for Italy to deliver manufactured goods worth a total of 60 billion lire to the Soviet Union over a three-year period. The Soviet Union will offset this with an equivalent value of grains and raw materials. The payment agreement stipulates a clearing system for accounts between the two countries in Italian lire. As for the trade and shipping treaty, it stipulates the principle of mutual benefit between the two countries in the field of trade, especially on issues such as tariffs, transportation, domestic taxes, and shipping, stipulating the most-favored-nation status, with special rights and exceptions excluded.
