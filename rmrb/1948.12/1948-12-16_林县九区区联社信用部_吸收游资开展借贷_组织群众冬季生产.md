Lin County Ninth District United Cooperative Credit Department
　Absorbs Idle Funds to Carry Out Lending
　Organizes the Masses for Winter Production
[Taihang News] In order to solve the financial difficulties of the masses in winter production, the Lin County Ninth District United Cooperative has specially established a credit department to absorb idle funds and surplus grain from the masses for in-kind lending, in order to organize the strength of the masses and solve the difficulties of the masses, achieving initial results.

When the credit department was first established, the cadres thought this was "exploitation" and inappropriate, and they were afraid that there would be too many depositors and not enough loans to give out, and that they would lose money; they were also afraid that the loans would not be recovered. Some people thought that "poverty is glorious," and those with money dared not reveal it, fearing that the credit was not reliable, and fearing that good grain would be returned as bad grain, and that withdrawal would not be free. After discovering these ideas, a meeting of all cooperative cadres was convened to repeatedly study and analyze the nature and purpose of in-kind deposit and in-kind loan, and whether the masses needed it, clearing up the cadres' thinking. Among the masses, it was first publicized that the current deposit and loan are not exploitation, explaining that loans must be borrowed and repaid, can be deposited in whole and withdrawn in part, or deposited in part and withdrawn in whole, with free deposit and withdrawal; when storing good grain, the market's highest price should be the standard for repayment (store what you return). Borrowers should grasp the real thing, start from production, speed up turnover, and only profit, not lose. After extensive publicity and specific organization, 86 households in 14 villages, including Xihuangmu and Lijia Gou, took out loans; currently, 15,618 catties of grain (rice and wheat), 200 catties of cotton, and 300 catties of edible salt have been deposited. Most of the borrowers are small cooperatives and mutual aid groups; in business, they mainly engage in transportation, grain sales, and opening workshops. For example, the Xiguan workshop borrowed 2,000 catties of rice and bought 2,000 catties of wool, which was returned within five days, earning 250,000 yuan, and earning 15 catties of interest from lending rice. They felt that the interest was low, the profit was high, and it could help in an emergency. Li Qitong of Dongmaan said, "The world is really easy now." After Guo Fuzhen of Dongshan Village deposited 200 catties of grain in the credit cooperative, he felt that it was both safe and profitable. Due to the influence of the district cooperative's lending, the masses also dared to help each other with loans.

　　林县九区区联社信用部
  　吸收游资开展借贷
  　组织群众冬季生产
    【太行讯】林县九区区联社，为了解决群众冬季生产的资金困难，专门设立了信用部，吸收群众游资、余粮进行实物借贷，以组织群众的力量，解决群众困难，获得初步成绩。
    当开始成立信用部时，干部认为这是“剥削”不恰当，又怕存户多贷不出，怕亏了本；又怕贷出收不回来。有些群众认为“穷光荣”，有钱的不敢露，怕信用靠不住，又怕存好粮还坏粮，抽时不自由。发现了这些思想后，便召开了全社干部会议，对存实贷实的性质、目的及是否群众需要等再三作了研究和分析，打通了干部思想。在群众中，首先宣传了现在存款贷款不是剥削，说明贷款有借有还，可整入零抽，或零入整抽，入抽自由；存好粮，还时按市场最高价格作标准（存啥还啥）。贷户应掌握实物，从生产出发，周转快些，只能有利，不会吃亏。经过广泛宣传与具体组织后，贷款的就有西皇木、栗家沟等十四个村八十六户；现已存粮（米麦）一万五千六百一十八斤，棉花二百斤，食盐三百斤。贷户大部是小型社、互助组；在营业上，主要是运输、贩粮、开作坊。如西关作坊贷米二千斤，买毛二千斤，五天内即归还了，并赚洋二十五万元，贷米出利十五斤。他们感到出利少，赚钱多，能救急。东马安李起童说：“现在世道真活便了”。东山村郭福镇把二百斤粮食存到信用社后，感到又保险又得利。由于区社贷款影响，群众也敢互助借款了。
