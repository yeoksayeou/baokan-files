　　“Tumor of the Uterine Adnexa”
  　Surgery is the Best Option

    Question: A woman, 46 years old this year, has a very swollen abdomen, said to be due to water and gas accumulation. This illness started two years ago, said to be caused by anger. It is sometimes mild and sometimes severe. This year, she consulted a doctor who said it was water and gas accumulation, and it would be better to drain it. She took four doses of his laxative, and her abdomen did shrink. She stopped taking medicine after that. After resting for over a hundred days, the illness recurred, and her abdomen swelled again. So she took two more doses of the same doctor's laxative, but it didn't work. A palm-sized mass was found on the left side of her abdomen. Before this recurrence, that mass was painful, and the pain caused her abdomen to swell. She feels bloated after eating. Puncturing it releases yellow fluid. Based on the above situation, how should it be treated?

    Answer: Since relying solely on the patient's complaint is not comprehensive enough, the diagnosis may be somewhat arbitrary. However, it can serve as a reference for recuperation and a guide for future treatment.

    The diagnosis is "tumor of the uterine adnexa." The occurrence of ascites (i.e., water accumulation) is common in this disease. Compression of the abdominal cavity will cause bloating, and feeling bloated after eating is inevitable. Taking laxatives can drain the water. However, it can only temporarily relieve symptoms and cannot completely cure the disease. Injections with diuretics (such as Salyrgan) can also resolve ascites but cannot cure the mass. If you want a radical cure, you must go to the gynecology department of Hebei Provincial People's Hospital in Shijiazhuang (石門的和平医院) for a thorough examination. After confirmation, surgical removal of the mass will lead to a quick recovery (surgery for this disease is not dangerous, so you can rest assured).

　　“子宫附属器肿瘤”
  　最好实行手术
    问：一个妇女今年四十六岁，肚涨很大，据说是水、气鼓病症。这病自从前年就发生了，据说是从气上所得，有时轻有时重，在今年请了个先生，他说是水气鼓，往下泻泻就好了；吃了他四付泻药，肚子可就消了，从此也就不再吃药了。养了一百余天，病又复犯，肚子又涨起来，于是又吃了那个先生两付泻药，没生效力，肚子左边又发现了手掌大一块病，这回犯病前，那块病先疼，疼的肚子就涨起来了。吃了饭觉得发胀，扎上针就流黄水，按照以上情形，该怎样医治？
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（李荣英）
    答：因为仅按病人的主诉，是不够全面的，所以诊断上可能有些武断，不过以此可作休养的参考及今后治疗上的指针。
    病名是“子宫附属器肿瘤”，本病发生腹水（即水鼓）是常见的，压迫腹腔就会发胀，饭后觉得发蹩是必然的现象，吃了泻药是可以把水排泄出去的。不过仅能是一时的缓解症状而不能完全使本病痊愈。想打针（注射）可用利尿剂（如撒立汞等）但也只能解决腹水，不能治愈腹块。若想根本治疗时须到石门的和平医院妇科检查确实后，行手术摘出病块，则很快的就会好的（再此病做手术是没有危险的，可以放心）。
