　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th. Dutch imperialists and the reactionary Indonesian government are carrying out cruel massacres and mass arrests of the Indonesian people. According to TASS, The Hague, 7th: Dutch troops carried out a massacre in South Sulawesi, where more than 30,000 peaceful residents were killed. According to the Diantong News Agency, Singapore, November 24th: Open anti-democratic terror is prevalent in the Republic of Indonesia. The collaborationist Hatta recently launched an anti-communist movement to cover up his ultimate conspiracy to sell out the Indonesian people to Dutch imperialists. According to a recent report published by the TASS citing the Indonesian Army General Staff Headquarters: Since the Madiun Affair, 45,000 people have been arrested. Such atrocities by the Dutch imperialists and the Hatta reactionary government have aroused opposition from the broad masses of the Dutch people. According to TASS, The Hague, 8th: A Committee to Aid Indonesia has been established in the Netherlands. The committee is led by members of parliament, prominent social leaders, and trade union leaders. The committee issued an appeal to the people, demanding that the people resolutely protest the acts of terror in Indonesia, suggesting that the Hatta government immediately release the imprisoned Indonesian patriots, and urging relief for the victims of the Hatta government and the Dutch command's acts of terror.
