　　Shijiazhuang Factories Respond to Municipal Party Committee Call
  　Production Increase Campaign Fully Launched
    Workers Initiate Competition to Guarantee Task Completion
  　The Banner of Commendation is Truly Glorious
  　Striving to Obtain It Means Being a Model Worker
    [Our Dispatch] The state-owned factories in Shijiazhuang, on the basis of summarizing war preparations and rewarding model workers in war preparations, have fully launched a production increase and loss compensation competition campaign. The development of this campaign fully demonstrates the enhanced class consciousness of the entire working class. Since the call for a production increase and loss compensation competition from the Shijiazhuang Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party was conveyed to the factories, all workers, staff, engineers, factory directors, and other personnel in each factory have been mobilized. The Communist Party branches, trade unions, and worker groups in each factory have conducted detailed discussions. At a mobilization meeting of hundreds of people at the Railway Bureau, workers recalled the glorious struggles from the "February 7th" Movement to the present, filling each worker with confidence and guaranteeing the completion of this production increase and loss compensation task. The Yumin factories, at a celebration of resumption of work and award ceremony for model workers, immediately seized the opportunity to respond to the call of the Shijiazhuang Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, launching challenge competitions among the factories. On the spot, they decided to write to Comrade Liu Xiufeng and Mayor Ke of the Municipal Committee, guaranteeing the compensation of losses incurred during war preparations within a short period. All employees of Factory 312 launched a revolutionary competition against Factories 310 and 320. The workers proposed guaranteeing that the factory's production would not be affected by power outages during the competition and guaranteeing uninterrupted power supply for other factories. They voluntarily worked overtime during working hours to install lights and inspect and repair motors and starters everywhere. The workers of the Qianjin Factory were even more energetic. The factory's wheel production was completed half a month ahead of schedule, and the Wheel Shop completed its repair competition plan for passenger and freight cars sixteen days ahead of schedule on the fourteenth. The work results of one month and one day were equal to the output of the two months before war preparations. All employees of the factory, with the determination to "work diligently and not speak first," wanted to create better results, fully demonstrating the great spirit of the working class. The decoration shop, which was relatively backward in the past, since the start of the production increase competition, many workers have been arriving early and leaving late. Even if the quitting bell rings sometimes, they insist on finishing the work before resting. After completing their own work, the coal water car team went to help the air chamber and cylinder teams. Previously, two people carried a crescent-shaped board, but now Liu Fengming carries two boards in one trip. The Machine Shop once experienced an obstruction due to a motor malfunction, delaying work for thirteen hours. Through everyone's efforts and rush repairs, only 28 people's six-hour assault made up for the losses incurred in the past thirteen hours. The director, foreman, and clerks of the shop all voluntarily increased their voluntary work by half an hour each day. The work of the office shop has increased by an average of one-third in the past week. Workers at the Xinhua Weaving Factory, since the launch of the competition, have shown unprecedented new labor enthusiasm. Wood loom weavers Ma Lie and Lu Zongyi, who previously wove 50 yards of sackcloth per day, can now weave 60 yards. Apprentices Ma Xilin and Huo Shuangnian, who previously strung one heddle per day, now string three heddles per day. After completing their own work, they ask the squad leader for work such as pulling cloth and beating cloth. In addition to encouraging each other verbally during work, the workers also wrote on the blackboard in the machine room: "Work hard! Strive to be a model worker in the competition. The banner of commendation is so beautiful! Let's see who wins the banner to be considered glorious!" These slogans are both vivid and lively. What is the guarantee that this competition campaign can be fully launched? First of all, it is the improvement of the workers' awareness. The workers recognize that they are the masters of the factory and that their efforts are for the happiness of the people. Therefore, the spirit of unity and mutual assistance among workers has also been strengthened. Many workers have organized mutual aid groups in the competition, and the phenomenon of everyone taking care of their own business no longer exists. For example, in the Qianjin Factory, in the past, only the cylinder team pulled the cylinder liners, which took three or four hours each time. Now workers from other teams have come to help. Furthermore, the leadership has been strengthened. Many of the systems that could not be unified in the past have now been unified. In the past, there was insufficient recognition of the workers' enthusiasm and creativity, but now this has been completely corrected. Many factory leaders have handed over work plans to the employees, allowing them to think of ways, formulate specific plans, and maximize the wisdom of the vast number of workers. The development of the entire production increase and loss compensation competition campaign tells us that only when the workers' awareness is improved and combined with correct leadership can the victorious completion of the production increase campaign be guaranteed.

　　石市各工厂响应市委号召
  　增产运动全面展开
    职工们发起竞赛保证完成任务
  　表扬的旗子真光荣
  　争取到手就是模范
    【本报特讯】石家庄市各公营工厂，在总结备战、奖励备战模范的基础上、全面展开增产补损竞赛运动。这一运动的开展，充分的显示出全体职工阶级觉悟的提高。自从中共石家庄市委的增产补损竞赛的号召传达各工厂以后，每个工厂里，所有的工人、职员、工程师、厂长等人员全部动员起来了。各工厂共产党支部、职工会、各工人小组，都做了详细的讨论。铁路局百人的动员大会上，工人们都回忆了“二七”运动直到现在历次光荣的斗争时，每个工人都充满了信心，保证完成此次增产补损的任务。裕民各厂在庆祝复工奖励模范的大会上，职工们就“趁热打铁”，响应了中共石家庄市委的号召，各厂间互相展开了挑战竞赛。当场决定写信告诉市委刘秀峰同志、柯市长，保证在短时期内，补偿备战中的损失。三一二工厂全体职工向三一○、三二○工厂发起革命的竞赛运动，工人提出保证竞赛期间使全厂生产不受停电影响，保证不误其他工厂用电。在工作时间内自动加班，按装电灯，检查修理各处电动机及起动机。前进工厂的职工劲头就更足了，该厂车轮提前半月完成了生产计划，车轮所十四日提前十六天完成修理客货车的竞赛计划，此一个月零一天的工作成绩等于备战前两个月的产量，该厂全体职工，以“埋头苦干、不先说话”的决心，要创造更好的成绩，充分的显示出工人阶级伟大的精神，该厂在过去较为落后的装修所，自增产竞赛以来，许多工人都是早来晚回，即便有时打了下班钟，也要坚持着把工作完成后再休息。炭水车组完成了自己的工作后，就去帮助气室气缸两组工作。以前是两个人扛一块月牙板，而现在刘凤鸣一趟就扛了两块。机工所某次因电机发生阻碍，耽误了十三小时工作，经大家努力抢修，仅廿八个人六小时的突击，就补足了过去十三小时内所受的损失。该所主任领班司事，都自动的每天增加半小时的义务工。办工所一周来的工作，平均提高三分之一。新华织厂工人，从开展竞赛以来，新的劳动热忱空前的提高，木机织布工人马烈、卢宗义，过去每天织面袋布五十码，现在能织到六十码。学徒马西霖、霍双年过去每天穿一个综，现在每天穿三个综。做完本身工作后，又向班长找牵布、打布等工作做。工人们除了工作中，在嘴头上互相鼓励外，并在机房里的黑板上写着：“努力吧！在竞赛中争取模范，表扬的旗子多好看！看谁争得旗子才算光荣！”这些口号提得既生动又活泼。这次竞赛运动能全面开展起来的保证是什么呢？首先是工人觉悟程度的提高，工人们认识到自己是工厂的主人，都知道自己的努力是为人民的幸福，因此工人之间的团结互助的精神也随之加强了。竞赛中很多工人都组织了互助小组，过去各顾各的现象是不存在了。比如前进工厂，从前拉汽缸套，只是气缸班做，每次需用三、四个钟头，现在别的班里的工人，都纷纷前来帮忙。甚次是领导上加强了，过去有不少的不能统一的制度，现在统一起来了，过去对工人积极性和创造性认识不足，现在完全纠正过来了，不少的工厂领导上，把工作计划均交给职工们，让他们去想办法，订具体的计划，尽量的发扬广大工人的智慧。整个的增产补损竞赛运动的开展，告诉了我们：只有职工的觉悟提高，和正确领导相结合，增产运动的胜利完成才有保证。
