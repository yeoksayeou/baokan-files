　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th: TASS, New York, 16th: In the United States, the demand for goods has clearly decreased in the past two months. Several industries have already reduced production, workers are being laid off, or a small work week (meaning reducing workers' employment time) is being implemented. A bulletin from the Department of Commerce's Bureau of Statistics pointed out that on December 13th, the total number of workers participating in weekly work of fifteen to thirty-four hours (meaning each worker is only employed for about two and a half to five and a half hours per day) reached 10.4 million, while on October 9th, it was 7.2 million. Currently, various commodities are piled up like mountains in warehouses, with a total value of up to $54.4 billion. The press and industrial figures are extremely alarmed by the current economic situation and anticipate it will become more severe in the coming months. Therefore, labor unions are demanding excess profits taxes and increased wages without simultaneously raising prices. Industrialists, on the other hand, insist on refusing workers' demands for wage increases. The Wall Street Journal mocked the labor unions' demands for excess profits taxes and wage increases as the "eighth wonder of Genesis." The New York Times frankly admitted that industrialists have begun to reduce production and lay off workers in order to maintain high prices. Newspapers daily publish many reports of production cuts, implementation of small work weeks, and layoffs in the textile, wool, hosiery, electrical appliance, rubber, and other industries across the United States. In the past two months, the textile and hosiery industries have laid off 100,000 workers. Some electrical appliance companies have laid off more than 50% of their workers. The reduction in coal production is also very significant. Thousands of mines have reduced coal production, and some mines have completely closed down. Most miners only work part-time. According to the Associated Press, Federal Employment Bureau Director Goodwin stated that the reason the people's employment level has been maintained to a considerable extent until now is due to weapon production and foreign trade under the Marshall Plan.

　　美货销路下降
    仓库里充满了存货卖不出去资本家极恐慌开始解雇减产
    【新华社陕北廿日电】塔斯社纽约十六日讯：美国在最近两月内，对货物的需要已显然下降，若干工业已形减产，工人被解雇，或实行小工作周（按即缩减工人的受雇时间）。商务部统计局的公报指出：十二月十三日，参加每周十五到三十四小时工作的工人（按即每个工人每日只有二小时半至五小时半左右的时间受雇），总数高达一千零四十万人，而十月九日则为七百二十万人。目前，在各个仓库中，各种商品已堆积如山，总值高达五百四十四亿美元。报界与工业界人士对目前经济局势极表惊慌，并预料在今后数月内将更形严重。因此，各工会要求征收超额利得税，增加工资而不要同时提高物价。工业家方面，则坚持拒绝工人增加工资的要求。华尔街日报嘲笑工会方面指出的加征超额利得税与增加工资的要求是“创世纪中的第八个奇迹”。纽约时报坦白承认，工业家为了保持高物价，已开始减少生产与解雇工人。报纸每天刊载着美国各地纺织、羊毛、鞋袜、电气用具、橡皮等工业中的减产，实行小工作周与解雇工人的许多消息。在最近两月内，纺织与鞋袜工业已解雇了十万工人。有些电气用具公司，已解雇了工人百分之五十以上。煤业方面减产情形亦甚显著。成千的矿场减少了煤的产量，而有些矿场则完全关门。大部分矿工只做一部分时间的工作。据报联社报导，联邦就业局局长高德温称：人民就业水平所以能维持到相当程度，直到现在都是依靠武器生产与马歇尔计划下的对外贸易。
