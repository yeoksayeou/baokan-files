Xinhua News Agency, Shaanxi Central Front, 7th: Frontline reporters report that the Northwest Field Army's first campaign since the beginning of winter has achieved a great victory with three battles and three victories. The three operations resulted in the complete annihilation of one enemy army and the majority of two divisions, totaling approximately 30,000 troops, including the capture of over 19,000 prisoners. Our army launched the offensive on November 15th, initially attacking the Hu bandit 90th Army (comprising two divisions) and the 144th Division that had invaded the Heiyang area. On the morning of the 15th, after annihilating an entire regiment of the 144th Division, our troops penetrated deep into enemy territory at night and annihilated another entire regiment and an entire battalion. This rapid action by our army greatly alarmed the Hu bandits, who hastily transferred the First Army (comprising three divisions), the 69th Army (one division), and remnants of the 65th Army, the 17th Army, and the 38th Army from Weinan, Fuping, Pucheng, and other areas to congregate north of the Li River. Together with the 36th Army, the 90th Army, and the 76th Army, already stationed north of the Li River, they amassed a force of approximately fourteen divisions in an attempt to block our army's offensive. At this time, another unit of our army suddenly appeared on November 22nd in the plain area between Pucheng, Fuping, and Yaoxian, west of the Luo River, and annihilated the majority of the 17th Division of the bandit Third Army in one fell swoop, capturing the important fortified position of Juntailing, directly threatening Tongguan. The Hu bandits hastily transferred troops from east of the Luo River to block our army's offensive, but their westward-bound reinforcements were intercepted by our army. On the afternoon of the 25th, the enemy's 76th Army's 24th Division, attempting to reinforce westward and advancing to 40 li east of Pucheng, was intercepted by our army, resulting in the annihilation of a portion of it. Our army also surrounded Yongfeng Town, east of the Luo River, on the evening of the 25th, trapping the entire 76th Army (including all of the 20th Division and remnants of the 24th Division), totaling over 15,000 troops, within an earthen stockade approximately 700 meters long from east to west and over 300 meters wide from north to south, preventing them from escaping. After two general assaults, totaling approximately five hours, on the 27th and 28th, our army completely annihilated the enemy army, leaving no one to escape. The Hu bandits, attempting to save the fate of the annihilated army, ordered the enemy 90th Army, 36th Army, and the 135th Division of the 69th Army stationed on Rouge Mountain, only ten li away, to provide assistance, but these troops never dared to advance a single step. The Hu bandits also ordered the remnants of the First Army, the 65th Army, the 38th Army, and the 17th Army stationed in the Fuping and Yaoxian areas to rush to the east of the Luo River day and night to provide assistance, but the army had already been completely annihilated by the time they arrived on the east bank of the Luo River. In this winter offensive by our army, the Hu bandits mobilized a total of eleven armies, totaling nineteen divisional designations, for defensive forces on both sides of the Luo River. Their mobile units, such as the First Army, the 65th Army, the 38th Army, and the 17th Army, were dragged around by our army on both sides of the Luo River for three rounds, without rest for twelve days. The enemy, fearing annihilation by our army, took detours, marching an average of 80 to 100 li per day, on empty stomachs, with blistered feet. Soldiers complained incessantly, and the troops were exhausted. After our army achieved this victory and annihilated approximately four divisions of Hu bandits, the so-called mobile defense of the Hu bandits in central Shaanxi has been smashed to pieces by our army.

Xinhua News Agency, Shaanxi Central Front, 4th: The Northwest Field Army Headquarters has announced the results of the battle to annihilate the enemy's 17th Division in the Kangzhuang area between Pucheng, Fuping, and Yaoxian on the 22nd and the capture of Juntailing, southeast of Tongchuan, on the 23rd as follows: A.

    西北我军冬季攻势作战中
    三战三捷歼敌三万
    胡匪“机动防御”被打得粉碎
    【新华社陕中前线七日电】前线记者报导：西北野战军入冬以来的第一个战役获得三战三捷的伟大胜利。三次作战共歼敌一个军的全部和两个师的大部，合计兵力约三万人，其中生俘一万九千余人。我军于十一月十五日发起攻势，以一部首先向侵入ｈé＠①阳地区之胡匪九十军（辖两个师）及一四四师举行攻击，十五日晨歼灭一四四师一个整团后，晚间又伸入敌后歼灭其一个整团及一个整营。我军此一神速动作使胡匪惊慌万分，慌忙自渭南、富平、蒲城等地调来第一军（辖三个师）六十九军（一个师）及六十五军、十七军、三十八军残部麇集荔北，加上原在荔北之三十六军、九十军及七十六军等共约十四个师的兵力妄图阻挡我军攻势。此时我军另部于二十二日又突然出现洛河以西之蒲城、富平、耀县中间平原地区，一举将匪第三军之十七师大部歼灭，并攻克重要设防阵地军台岭，直逼同官。胡匪又慌忙把洛东部队调来阻挡我军攻势，在其部队西援途中，又为我军腰斩。二十五日下午，妄图西援、进至蒲城东四十里之敌七十六军二十四师即为我军截击，歼其一部。我军并于二十五日晚包围洛河东之永丰镇，使七十六军（包括二十师全部及二十四师残部）全部一万五千余人困守在东西长约七百公尺南北宽约三百余公尺之土寨内，欲逃不得。经二十七、二十八两日，我军两次共约五小时之总攻击，即将该敌军全部歼灭，无一漏网。胡匪妄图挽救该军被歼的命运，曾令其相距只十余里的胭脂山之敌九十军、三十六军及六十九军之一三五师等部往援，但这些部队始终不敢前进一步。胡匪又令其进至富平、耀县地区之第一军及六十五军、三十八军、十七军等残部星夜赶往洛东救援，但刚到洛河东岸，该军已被全歼。在此次我军冬季攻势作战中，胡匪在洛河东西两岸共调集了十一个军计十九个师番号的防御兵力，其机动部队如一军、六十五军、三十八军、十七军等则被我军拖着鼻子在洛河东西两岸来回跑了三趟，十二天中没有休息。敌人因惧怕被我军歼灭，绕道行走，每日平均要走八十里至一百里，饿着肚子，脚打起泡，士兵怨声不绝，部队拖得疲惫不堪。我军在取得此一作战胜利、歼灭胡匪约四个师后，胡匪在陕中之所谓机动防御已被我军打得粉碎。
