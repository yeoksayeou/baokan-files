　　Surge of Enlistments in the Rural Areas of the Northern Yue Region
　　When the news of the liberation of Baoding reached every corner of the Northern Yue region through county, district, and village cadre meetings, mass meetings, blackboard newspapers, and rooftop broadcasts, the call of the Party and the People's Government to expand the People's Liberation Army immediately received a resounding response.
　　In this expansion of the army, the Communist Party members and cadres, who have always been at the forefront of the anti-Japanese War and the anti-feudal struggle, played a pioneering role as usual. Before mobilization even reached the villages, they automatically signed up for the army in the county and district. Some who were too old themselves took the lead in signing up their sons or brothers. Tian Luogen, a Communist Party member from Nanzhuangzi Village in Tang County, had three sons, all of whom were Communist Party members. The eldest son joined the army in 1944. During this enlistment drive, the second and third sons argued at a family meeting over who should sign up. In the end, the father chose the older second son. When sending his second son to the army, the father said, "My third son is not old enough, or I would have asked him to go too." At a mass meeting, after denouncing the Japanese invaders for their burning, killing, and looting of the people, he said, "I never thought that after Japan was defeated, Chiang Kai-shek would come along, just like the Japanese, not letting the people live in peace. Now he is about to be finished! Let's make one more effort and it will be done!" Eighteen village cadres from the first district of Xingtang signed up for the army. Tian Taifu, the village chief of Bali Village in the second district, is a demobilized soldier who signed up for the army again this time. He has four brothers; the fourth brother joined the Third Column, the third brother was recently disabled and returned home, and the second brother carried a stretcher to the Taiyuan front. Only he was left at home. He said, "I have been in the army for four years and have experience." The enlistment movement in the third district of the county was initiated by the automatic registration of the secretary of the Xu You Village branch and ten cadres. The fourth district was led by the director of the Youth League of Xi Village and the village chief and public security officer of Baimiao Village. Zhu Jinsheng, the militia captain of Mihokou Village in the fifth district, was wounded twice in the army in the past and returned home. Now that he has recovered, he has automatically signed up to go to the front. In Yangduanzhuang Village alone in the sixth district, three village cadres have signed up for the army. Li Jincai, a demobilized soldier, was rejected by doctors because of a disabled hand; he finally picked up a large gun and demonstrated it to the doctor on the spot, and only then was he approved. In addition, many female Party members mobilized their husbands and brothers to join the army in various counties.
　　Many village branches previously had blind disunity between new and old cadres, which had caused obstacles to many tasks. This time, upon hearing that national victory was only a year away, both new and old cadres were invariably invigorated. Coupled with the enlightenment and guidance of county and district cadres, they conducted self-criticism in the face of the glorious task of expanding the army, strengthened unity as never before, and carried out propaganda and mobilization among the masses together. Many villages, such as Meng'erzhuang in the second district of Pingshan and Xibaobuzhuang in the third district of Huolu, have smoothly completed the task of expanding the army in this way.
　　The loyalty and courage of Party members and cadres to the call of the Party and the interests of the people directly encouraged the masses. The masses made great efforts to support the plan to expand the army, so that it could be completed smoothly. They implemented self-registration and public discussion everywhere, deciding which young adults should join the army, helping those who joined the army to persuade their families, and solving various difficulties in their families' lives and production, so that the task of expanding the army was not hindered by any difficulties. According to statistics from the fourth sub-district of the Northern Yue region (Tang, Yi, Laiyuan and other counties) in the first five days of December alone, 1,700 young adults joined the army, and they are still continuing to enlist. Yang Youbing, a poor peasant from Shuiquan Village in Fuping County, had his eldest son join the army, and this time he automatically signed up his second son. When Liu Rongzhu's mother from Wangkuai Village sent her son to the army, she said, "Overthrow Chiang Kai-shek and come back to marry a good wife." When Li Siwa, the militia captain of Donglenggeliang Village in Fanshi County, signed up for the army, he asked the branch to allow him to join the Party. After being reviewed and approved by the district committee, he swore, "I will carry out the revolution for the Party and the people to the end." When Zhang Guifu, a turned-over poor peasant from Xichengzi, Tang County, enlisted in the army, he said to his mother, "We used to starve and freeze all the time. It was only with the Communist Party that we were able to eat our fill. Now Chiang Kai-shek is about to collapse, and I will do my part as a soldier! I won't come back to see you until Chiang Kai-shek is overthrown!" When the young men from Pingshan enlisted in the army, they loudly asked the doctors, "No need to check, we are not sick!" They were happily playing games such as cat and mouse, cripple hitting the blind man, twisting秧歌, and telling stories at the new recruit reception center. When they drilled, the shouts startled the villagers.

　　北岳农村的参军潮
    保定解放的消息，经过县区村干部大会及群众大会、黑板报、屋顶广播，传达到北岳区每个角落中去的时候，党和人民政府提出的扩大解放军的号召，立即得到响亮的回答。
    过去在抗日战争与反封建斗争中历来站在最前列的共产党员与干部，这次扩军中，同样起了先锋作用。还没等动员到村，他们就在县里和区里自动报名去参军；有些自己年纪大了的，则抢先替自己的儿子或兄弟报了名。唐县南庄子村共产党员田洛根有三个儿子，都是共产党员。大儿子一九四四年参军走了，这次参军中，二子和三子在家庭会上争着要报名。最后由父亲选择了较大的二子。父亲在送二子参军时说：“我的三儿子还不够年岁，要不我叫他也去。”他在群众会上痛骂日寇对老百姓的烧杀抢掠后说：“想不到日本打败了，又来了个蒋介石，和日本一模一样，不叫老百姓过安生日子。现在他也快完蛋了！咱们再鼓一把劲就行了！”行唐一区报名参军的村干部有十八名。二区八里村长田太福是一个复员军人，这次又报名参军。他弟兄四个，四弟参加了三纵队，三弟不久以前残废，退伍回家，二弟抬担架到了太原前线，只剩他一个在家。他说：“我在部队上干过四年，有经验。”该县三区的参军运动，是许由村支部书记和十个干部的自动报名带动起来的。四区是习村青联主任和白庙村村长、公安员等带动起来的。五区米霍口村民兵中队长朱进生过去在部队两次负伤回家，现在养好了，又自动报名上前线。六区仅杨段庄一村，已有报名参军的村干部三人。复员军人李进才因手残废，医生一再摇头，不让他参军；他最后拿起大枪当场试验给医生看，这才得到批准。此外，各县女党员动员自己丈夫和兄弟参军的事也非常多。
    有不少村支部，以前存在着新老干部间盲目的不团结，曾造成许多工作的障碍。这次听到再有一年就要全国胜利了，新老干部都无例外的振奋起来。再加上县区干部的启发诱导，于是纷纷在光荣的扩军任务面前各自进行自我检讨，空前地加强了团结，共同向群众进行宣传动员。平山二区孟耳庄、获鹿三区西鲍庄等许多村，都是这样顺利地完成了扩军任务。
    党员干部对党的号召与人民利益的忠勇，更直接的鼓舞了群众。群众用很大的努力支持扩军的计划，使它顺利地完成。他们到处实行着自报公议，议定那些青壮年应该去参军，帮助参军者劝导其家属，解决其家属生活上生产上的各种困难，使扩军任务不为任何困难所阻。仅北岳四分区（唐、易、涞源等县）十二月初的五天统计，即有一千七百名青壮年入伍，并仍在继续入伍。阜平县水泉村贫民杨有丙，大儿参了军，这次又自动替他二儿报了名。王快村民刘荣珠的母亲送子参军时说：“打倒蒋介石，回来娶个好媳妇。”繁峙县冻冷圪梁村中队长李四娃报名参军时，要求支部允许他入党，经区委审查批准后，他发誓说：“我要为党为人民革命到底。”唐县西城子翻身贫农张贵福在入伍时对他娘说：“咱过去一直挨饿受冻，有了共产党，才吃上饱饭。现在蒋介石就快垮了，当兵我也有一份！打不倒蒋介石，不回来见娘！”平山的青年小伙子们入伍时，高声的要求医生：“不用检查，我们没病！”他们在新兵招待处兴高采烈地闹着猫捉鼠、拐子打瞎子、扭秧歌、说书。上操时，喊声把村里的居民都惊出来了。
