　　Wasting Civilian Labor is Also Bureaucratism
　　Recently, the task of supporting the front has been relatively heavy. Most organizations and groups have paid attention to economizing when mobilizing civilian labor. However, quite a few incidents of wasting civilian labor have occurred in the Fourth Sub-district of the North Yue Military Region. These situations are roughly as follows:
　　Procedures are not completed in advance, resulting in either people and animals returning empty-handed or discrepancies between the mobilized numbers and the actual transported numbers. For example, on September 24th, the Logistics Department of the Military Region transported 23,000 pairs of cotton shoes (totaling 35,000 jin) from a certain place in Jianping to another location. Comrade Wang Guitang of the department mobilized 200 head of livestock and 256 civilian laborers from the Fourth District of Jianping, traveling 110 li overnight to reach a certain place. However, after the people and livestock arrived, the shoes were not issued because the receiving procedures had not been completed. As a result, not a single shoe was transported, forcing all the people and livestock to return empty-handed. A certain comrade from the North Yue Military Region's Zhengding Logistics Station telegraphed the sub-district on October 17th to transport 93,000 jin of cotton shoes from Lingshou to another location. The large carts and livestock from Lingshou arrived on time, but the procedures had not been completed, causing the masses to wait in vain for two days. Moreover, the actual amount transported was only 70,200 jin, wasting 23,000 jin of transport capacity. Alternatively, mobilization occurs ahead of the scheduled time. On October 16th, the Logistics Department mobilized 700 people and 700 livestock from Jingxing to transport ammunition. Because the command was not unified and the stipulated time was not followed, they were gathered two days early. After arriving at the designated location, the people issuing ammunition had not yet arrived, resulting in another wasted trip. There were also instances where the original plan changed when mobilizing civilian labor, but no notification was given promptly, causing the masses to waste their work. Regarding the use of mobilization certificates, there were also instances of fraudulently using them in violation of regulations. For example, some mobilization certificates had the leader's seal but lacked the quantity and starting and ending points, or they were blank "Ruyi certificates" (meaning the user could fill them out as they pleased, without restrictions) signed by the leader, which they filled out at will. Even the stubs were taken down and used as mobilization certificates, or they were arbitrarily altered for "flexible" use. Other illegal and forced mobilization phenomena were also frequently discovered.
　　Why did such wasteful and even illegal forced mobilization occur? I believe the primary reason is that the working methods of the leading organs do not emphasize scientific organization and meticulous and accurate calculations. In "Lenin on How Soviet Functionaries Should Work," it states: "Lenin demanded from everyone accuracy, organization, and discipline in work." Currently, our war support work is so vast and complex, and a large part of it is located in the dispersed rural environment with inconvenient transportation. If the leadership does not have constant supervision and inspection, does not pay attention to procedures, lacks accurate time and numerical concepts, and even illegally alters mobilization certificates or forces mobilization, it cannot be denied that this is a manifestation of bureaucraticism that lacks enthusiasm and responsibility for the interests of the masses. Therefore, it is suggested that the leading organs should educate cadres well, first and foremost to strictly abide by the North China Provisional Service Regulations, that no one should be illegally assigned, and that mobilization procedures should be strictly enforced. Secondly, it is imperative to pay close attention to accurate and meticulous calculations beforehand, make plans, and complete all procedures in advance to avoid people and livestock traveling back and forth in vain. After receiving the plan, the dispatching organization should also carefully calculate based on the specific situation and review whether the mobilization plan is appropriate. For long-distance transportation, the accommodation locations should be accurately planned in advance, supply stations should be set up, and the user and dispatching organizations should be jointly responsible for unified leadership. When allocating load weight, there should be certain regulations, and escort cadres should not force excessive loads to avoid damaging the livestock. At the same time, when hiring transportation, sufficient freight fees should be issued, preferably directly to the transportation laborers, to reduce procedural hassles. More importantly, the responsible organs must diligently inspect, especially in the dispersed rural environment, where problems may not be detected in time by the leading organs. Without constant inspection and supervision, it is difficult to eliminate this type of rural-style bureaucratic phenomenon.

### 浪费民力也是官僚主义

　　浪费民力也是官僚主义
    最近，支前任务比较繁重，大多数机关团体在动用民力时都注意到力求节约，但在北岳四分区还发生了不少浪费民力的事件，大概有以下这些情形：
    事先不办好手续，弄得不是人畜空回，就是动员数字与实运数字不符。如九月二十四日军区兵站部从建屏某地往别处运棉鞋二万三千双（共三万五千斤），该部王贵堂同志到建屏四区动员牲口二百头，民工二百五十六人，经一百一十里行程连夜赶到某地。但人畜到达后，因还没有办好领取手续，工厂不发，结果一只鞋也没运，害得人和牲口又全部空跑回来。北岳兵站部驻正定兵站某同志，十月十七日电告分区，从灵寿往别地运棉鞋九万三千斤，灵寿大车牲口按时到达，可是手续还未办好，叫群众白等两天，同时起运数目也只有七万零二百斤，浪费了二万三千斤的运输力。或者是不按照规定时间提前动员，十月十六日，兵站部动员井陉人畜各七百运弹药，因为指挥不统一，没有遵照规定时间，提早集中两天，到指定地点后，发弹药的还未去，又是白跑一趟。也有在动员民力时，原计划变动了，却不赶快通知，害得群众白误工。对于动员证的使用，也有不按条例冒充混骗的，比如有的动员证首长盖了章，但却无数量和起至点，或者首长署了名的空白的“如意证”（意即由使用者拿着遂意填写，不受限制），自己拿着遂意填写，更有的把存根也拿下当动员证使用，甚或任意涂改，“灵活”使用。其他非法强制动员的现象也发现不少。
    为什么曾发生这种浪费民力甚至非法强制的现象？我认为首先是领导机关的工作方法不讲求科学地组织和周密准确的计算。“列宁论苏维埃机关人员应如何工作”中有：“列宁向大家要求工作上的精确性、组织性、纪律性。”目前我们的战勤支前工作如此庞大浩繁，大部又处在分散的农村环境，交通不便，领导上没有随时监督检查，不注意手续，没有准确的时间和数字观念，甚至非法涂改动员证或强制动员，这不能不说是对群众利益缺乏热情和责任心的官僚主义现象。因之建议领导机关应好好教育干部，首先要切实遵守华北暂行勤务条例，任何人不得非法强派，并严格动员手续。其次要十分注意事前应有精确周密的计算，作好计划，提前办好一切手续，以免人畜力徒劳往返。出勤机关接到计划后，也应根据具体情况精打细算，审查动员计划是否合适。长途运输时，应预先准确计划住宿地，设置供应站，由用勤出勤机关协同负责，统一领导。分配驮量时，应有一定规定，押送干部不得强制多驮，以免损伤牲口。同时代雇运输时，应发足运费，最好直接发给驮运民工，减少手续麻烦。更重要的是负责机关一定要勤于检查，特别是在分散的农村环境中，出了毛病领导机关不一定能及时发觉。不时时检查监督，就难杜绝这种农村式的官僚主义现象。
