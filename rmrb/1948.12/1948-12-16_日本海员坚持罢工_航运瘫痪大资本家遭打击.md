Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th—The Japanese Seamen's Union's persistent strike, according to an Agence France-Presse dispatch from Tokyo on the 9th, has brought 559 ships in 51 ports throughout Japan to a standstill, severely hitting the vital production sectors of Japanese big capitalists. Due to the paralysis of coal and pig iron transportation, major Japanese factories have been forced to stop work or reduce production. Currently, 17 major fertilizer and chemical factories in the Osaka and Kyushu areas are in danger of shutting down at any time, while power plants, cement plants, gas plants, and other important manufacturing plants in the Tokyo-Yokohama area are about to experience a coal shortage. The Japanese Ministry of Transport declared on the 8th that the strike situation is worsening, and the Seamen's Union headquarters has announced that following the current strike, a third 72-hour strike will be launched from the 11th.

　　日本海员坚持罢工
  　航运瘫痪大资本家遭打击
    【新华社陕北十三日电】日本海员工会的坚持罢工，据法新社东京九日电称：已使全日五十一个口岸内的五百五十九艘船只陷入停顿状态，严重地打击了日本大资本家的各重要生产部门。由于煤与铣铁的运输陷入瘫痪状态，已迫使日本主要工厂停止开工或减少生产。现在，大坂地区与九州地区十七家主要肥料工厂与化学工厂，有随时停工的危险，而东京——横滨地区的发电厂、水泥厂、煤气厂及其他重要制造厂，即将发生煤荒。日本运输省于八日宣称：罢工情势正恶化中，海员工会总部已宣布继目前的罢工后，自十一日起发动第三次持续七十二小时的罢工。
