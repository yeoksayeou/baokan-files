[Jinan Electric] Amidst continuous and great victories, the workers of Southern Hebei are excited and encouraged, and are taking practical actions to support the front lines. Over a thousand employees of public factories in the entire region are actively implementing the new policies of the Southern Hebei Industrial and Commercial Conference, and carefully studying technology. After the Handan Electric Light Company started operations last month, it burned more than seven tons of coal per day. As a result of the efforts of technician Zhou Zhensheng, stoker workers, etc., the daily coal consumption has been reduced to more than three tons, saving twice as much coal as at the beginning. Flour mill workers have improved their technology, increasing flour production; last month, the average daily output was 703 bags, and now the average daily output is 823 bags, an increase of 120 bags per day. At the same time, the workers are paying attention to protecting the machines, which has also improved the quality of the products. In order to increase production to support the front, the Wucheng Oil Factory completed the emergency procurement of 400,000 jin of corn seeds, and all the workers voluntarily increased their working hours by one hour (from nine hours to ten hours). In order to improve quality and quantity, they put forward the slogans "fry well," "steam well," and "hammer more." In the past, 900 jin of flower seeds were processed daily, but now 1,000 jin are processed daily. In the past, every 100 jin of seeds yielded 14 jin of oil, but now the average yield is 14 jin and 13 liang per 100 jin. At its highest, every 100 jin yields 15 jin. The Southern Hebei Pharmaceutical Factory is working more actively to respond to Chairman Mao's call to "increase production by an inch." The workers in the preparation room voluntarily proposed adding a night shift. Thanks to their efforts, work efficiency has increased by two-thirds. Guo Shifa, a worker who prepares ampoules, works hard and forgets to eat, fully demonstrating his wisdom and carefully manufacturing various instruments, achieving great results. Other factories are also working hard with excitement. In addition to stepping up winter production, farmers in various places are actively weaving military cloth and paying public grain. 1.8 million women in the region are rushing to weave 130 million square feet of military cloth, preparing to complete it all by the end of the lunar year. In order to ensure the high quality of military cloth and deliver it to the front lines as soon as possible, women in various villages have universally organized temporary textile mutual aid groups and launched a competition for fine, even, dry, white, and clean thread.

　　冀南工人积极支援前线
  　研究技术提高产品
    【冀南电】在连接不断的伟大胜利下，冀南工人兴奋鼓舞，正以实际行动支援前线。全区公营工厂千余职工，正积极贯彻冀南工商会议新方针，细心研究技术。邯郸电灯公司于上月开工后，每日烧煤七吨以上，经过技师周振升、烧火工人等努力的结果，每日用煤量已减到三吨多，比开始省煤一倍。面粉工厂工友提高了技术，面粉产量增多；上月平均日出七百零三袋，现平均日出八百廿三袋，每日多出一百二十袋。同时工友们都注意爱护机器，使产品质量也随之提高。武城油厂为增产支前，突击完成四十万斤苞籽提采购，全体工友自动的出增工一小时（由九小时增至十小时）。为使质量和数量提高，提出“炒好”、“蒸好”、“多打锤”的口号。过去每日打花籽九百斤，现每日打一千斤。过去每百斤出油十四斤，现在出油平均十四斤十三两。最高时每百斤出十五斤。冀南制药工厂，为响应毛主席“生产长一寸”的号召，工作更加积极起来。制剂室工友自动提出增加夜班。在他们努力下，工作效率提高三分之二。制按泡工人郭石发奋忘食，充分发扬自己智慧，精心制造各种仪器，获得极大成绩。其他各厂也都在兴奋的心情下努力生产。各地农民除加紧冬季生产外，则勇跃赶织军布及交纳公粮。全区有一百八十万妇女正赶织一万三千万方尺军布，准备在旧历年底全部完成。各村妇女为保证军布质量高，及早送到前线，普遍的组织临时纺织互助组，并展开线细、匀而又干、白、净的竞赛运动。
