　　Beiyue News: Huangshikou is a famous rice paddy area in the upper reaches of the Tang River. The rice seed traditionally used is a small red awn variety that has been passed down for many years, and its rice quality and yield are both poor. This spring, the border region's agricultural extension station selected Huangshikou as a key village for the promotion of superior rice seeds, and immediately transported 229 catties of Victory No. 5 rice for promotion. This rice has a high yield, good rice quality, does not lodge, and does not shed grains, but the stalks are a bit short. At the time, the farmers were skeptical, but after publicity and explanation, they persuaded nine households to plant a total of 16.4 mu.

　　After planting, the seedlings did not look good and were short, so the farmers were very disappointed, believing that it could not compete with the local rice varieties. After the autumn harvest, the new rice was brought to the threshing ground. Gui Zhu, one of the farmers, harvested six shi from 0.85 mu of land, whereas in the past, he would have harvested a maximum of 4.8 shi, meaning he harvested 1.2 shi more than before. The rice yield was also higher, with each shi yielding six dou of rice (local rice only yields four dou of rice). He calculated that this year, due to planting the No. 5 rice seed, he harvested an additional 1.68 shi of rice from this piece of land. Other farming households harvested 4 to 6 more dou of rice per mu; only one household harvested less because the rice seedlings were eaten by weasels.

　　The villagers of Huangshikou were all surprised when they heard this news. Those who had previously ridiculed the rice-planting households all said, "I didn't expect to harvest so much." Those who planted the Victory No. 5 rice seeds all beamed with joy.

　　北岳黄石口村五号稻种收成良好
    【北岳讯】黄石口为唐河上游著名稻滩，稻种为多年流传之小红芒，米质和产量均差。今年春天，边区农业推广场，择定黄石口为优良稻种的重点推广村，当即运来胜利五号水稻二百二十九斤推广。此稻产量大、米质好、不倒、不落粒，就是桔杆低些。当时农民半信半疑，后经宣传解释，才推动了九户，共种了十六亩四分。
    种上后秧苗极不好看，长的又矮，种户都很失望，农民认为无论如何抵不住本地稻种。秋收后，新稻上场，种齐户桂柱八分五厘地收了六市石，过去最多收四石八斗，比过去多收了一石二斗。出米也较多，每石能碾六斗米（本地稻只碾四斗米）。他自己计算了一下，今年因种五号稻种，这一块地多收了一石六斗八升稻米。其他几家种户每亩都多收四斗到六斗米，只有一户因稻秧被黄鼬吃掉，少收了一些。
    黄石口村的老乡，听到这些消息都惊奇的不止，从前那些讥笑种稻户的人，也都说：“想不到能收这么多。”种胜利五号稻种的人，都笑逐颜开。
