South Korea Under American Enslavement

After Japan's surrender in August 1945, the fifteen million South Korean people, accounting for sixty percent of the total Korean population, celebrated liberation with the North Korean people. They demonstrated unprecedented political enthusiasm, and under the leadership of the Korean Communist Party and the People's Party, forced the Japanese occupiers to surrender. People's Committees were established everywhere in towns and villages, taking over local administration. By August 31, 1945, 145 cities and villages in South Korea had established People's Committees. On September 6, representatives from the Korean National People's Committee and various social organizations held a congress in Seoul, announcing the establishment of the Korean People's Republic, electing the highest organ – the Central People's Committee – and issuing a progressive program of democratic reform. The achievements of this meeting were warmly supported by the broad masses of the Korean people. However, since September 8, when Hodge led American troops to land in Incheon Bay and enter South Korea, this newborn people's regime has been devastated. Hodge refused to recognize the People's Republic. He retained the entire Governor-General's staff, including Japanese Governor-General of Korea, Abe Nobuyuki, to continue ruling South Korea, which aroused a wave of protests from the South Korean people at the time. Under strong pressure from the masses, Hodge finally had to replace Abe and appoint old pro-Japanese elements headed by Kim Seong-su, who were despised by the people, and summon Syngman Rhee, a long-time American stooge, from Washington to assist him in enslaving the South Korean people. To this day, the South Korean puppet government and puppet parliament, which were fostered by American imperialism, are filled with these Democratic Party followers led by Kim Seong-su and the Independence Promotion Association members led by Syngman Rhee. They represent the interests of the comprador bourgeoisie and landlord class in South Korea, and their mission is to hate the people and be loyal to the United States.

For more than three years, under the rule of American occupiers and Korean traitors, the South Korean people have lived a colonial slave life even more impoverished and dark than under Japanese rule. South Korea is primarily an agricultural and light industrial area, rich in rice, wheat, soybeans, cotton, and tobacco. Korea's textile, tobacco, food, and other light industries are mostly concentrated here. In the past, grain was not only self-sufficient but also partially exported. After the American army took over South Korea, it announced the abolition of rice price controls, and landlords and wealthy merchants massively hoarded supplies. As a result, rice disappeared from the market after three months, and the black market price of rice soared more than threefold, leading to the great famine and riots in South Korea in early 1946. The land problem is also more serious than in the past. Eighty percent of the South Korean people are engaged in agricultural production. Before the Pacific War, 60 percent of the country's arable land was in the hands of the Japanese. After the Japanese were sent back home in 1946, the American army sold the land taken from the Japanese to wealthy landlords and unscrupulous merchants, so the phenomenon of land concentration became even more developed. Now, two-thirds of South Korea's 11 million acres of land are controlled by large landlords who account for only 3 percent of the population, and more than half of the farmers are tenants. According to a report in the New Era magazine in August of this year: "They have to pay 60 to 70 percent of their harvest each year as rent and military grain." Industrial production is generally at a standstill. According to the same magazine: "South Korea originally had 3,400 factories and other industries, such as textiles, hardware, machinery, and food. These industries were mainly located in cities such as Seoul, Incheon, Busan, Daegu, and Gwangju. Ninety percent of them previously belonged to the Japanese, and are now controlled by the Americans through the Special Enemy Property Committee. In 1946, about 40 percent were operating, but by December 1947, it had dropped to 25 percent, and even those factories that were operating could only work partially due to a lack of raw materials, parts, and electricity." The largest blood-sucking institution of the Japanese in Korea in the past – the Oriental Development Company – has now been taken over by the American military government at a cost of 700 million US dollars, renamed the New Korean Company, and continues to exploit the South Korean people. Due to rural poverty and urban production stagnation, according to official materials published by the Independence News: "As of last December, the number of unemployed people in South Korea had reached 2.5 million."

Simultaneous with the entry of the American army, the democratic movement of the South Korean people was brutally strangled. The Communist Party was driven underground, and democratic political parties and organizations such as the People's Party, the Democratic People's Front, the Farmers' Association, and the Women's Federation were unreasonably closed down. Many democratic newspapers were forced to cease publication, and a large number of editors and reporters were arrested. Prisons were filled with Korean patriots. In the second half of 1947, 26,412 people were detained in the eighteen prisons in South Korea. Even under Japanese rule in 1942, the total number of prisoners in the entire Korea was only 23,728. The police used to suppress the South Korean people have increased to 30,000, while under Japanese rule, the entire Korea never had more than 8,000 Korean police and 12,000 Japanese police.

However, America's starvation policy and reign of terror cannot stifle the resistance of the people. The fact that the vast majority of the South Korean people are now fighting with unyielding spirit to get rid of the enslavement of the United States and its running dog Korean traitors, and to strive for the reunification and independence of the motherland, is the best proof. In the one year from November 1946 to October 1947, there were 2,388 strikes by South Korean workers, involving 586,786 participants. The South Korean Labor Party, formed by the merger of the Communist Party, the People's Party, and the New People's Party, has become the leader of the South Korean national democratic movement and enjoys extremely high prestige among the people. In August of this year, under the leadership of the South Korean Labor Party, 6.7 million people, accounting for 77.5 percent of South Korean voters, enthusiastically elected 360 of their own representatives to participate in the All-Korea Supreme People's Assembly held in Pyongyang, regardless of the frantic persecution by the American occupiers and their running dogs. At the same time, the South Korean people have begun armed struggle. The people's guerrillas are growing stronger. (Xinhua News Agency)

    美国奴役下的南朝鲜
    一九四五年八月日本投降以后，占朝鲜总人口百分之六十的一千五百万南朝鲜人民，和北朝鲜人民一道欢欣鼓舞，庆祝解放。他们表现了史无前例的政治积极性，在朝鲜共产党与人民党的领导下，迫使日本占领者投降。城镇乡村中到处建立了人民委员会，接管地方行政。至一九四五年八月三十一日，南朝鲜成立了人民委员会的城市与乡村即有一百四十五处。九月六日，朝鲜全国人民委员会及各社会团体的代表，在汉城举行代表大会，宣布成立朝鲜人民共和国，选举最高机关——中央人民委员会，并发表了进步的民主改革纲领。这次会议的成就，获得广大朝鲜人民的热烈拥护。可是，自从九月八日，霍奇率领美军在仁川湾登陆进入南朝鲜以后，这个新生的人民政权，便遭到摧残。霍奇拒绝承认人民共和国，他留用日寇驻朝鲜总督阿部信行以下的全部总督府班子，继续统治南朝鲜，当时激起南朝鲜人民怒涛般的抗议。在群众强大压力之下，霍奇最后不得不撤换阿部，起用为人民所不齿的、以金性洙为首的旧亲日分子，并从华盛顿召回美国豢养有年的走狗李承晚，作为其奴役南朝鲜人民的帮凶。直到今天，美帝国主义一手扶植的南朝鲜伪政府与伪国会中，充斥着这批以金性洙为首的民主党党徒，与以李承晚为首的独立促进会分子，他们是南朝鲜买办资产阶级与地主阶级利益的代表，他们以仇视人民、效忠美国为职志。
    三年多来，南朝鲜人民在美国占领者与韩奸的统治下，过着比日本统治时代更为贫困与黑暗的殖民地的奴隶生活。南朝鲜本为农业与轻工业区，盛产米、麦、大豆、棉花与烟草。朝鲜的纺织、烟草、食品等轻工业，大部集中在这里。过去粮食不仅能够自给，而且尚能部分输出。美军接管南朝鲜后，宣布撤销米价管制制度，地主、富商便大肆搜购囤积。这样，在三个月后，米便在市场上绝迹，黑市米价狂涨三倍以上，酿成一九四六年初的南朝鲜大饥饿与大暴动。土地问题较过去也更严重了。南朝鲜人民有百分之八十从事农业生产，在太平洋战争前夕，全国耕地面积的百分之六十握在日人手里，一九四六年日人被遣送回国后，美军把日人手里接收下来的土地售与有钱的地主与奸商，因此，土地集中的现象更为发展。现在，南朝鲜一千一百万英亩的土地中，有三分之二为仅占人口百分之三的大地主所掌握，半数以上农民是佃农，据今年八月新时代杂志的报导：“他们每年须以收成的百分之六十至七十缴纳地租与军粮”。工业生产一般陷于停顿。据同一杂志称：“南朝鲜本有三千四百家纺织、五金、机器、食品等工厂和其他工业，这些工业，主要设在汉城、仁川、釜山、大邱、光州等城市，其中百分之九十过去属于日人，现在由美国人通过特别敌产委员会加以控制。一九四六年约有百分之四十开工，到一九四七年十二月，已降至百分之二十五，而且由于缺乏原料、零件与电力，即使开工的工厂，也仅能部分工作。”过去日人在朝鲜的最大吸血机构——东方拓殖公司，现由美国军政府以七亿美元代价接收下来，改名为新朝鲜公司，继续榨取南朝鲜人民。由于农村贫困、城市生产萎缩、据独立新闻发表的官方材料称：“截至去年十二月，南朝鲜失业人数已达二百五十万人。”
    与美军进入同时，南朝鲜人民的民主运动随之遭受惨酷的绞杀。共产党被打入地下，人民党、民主人民阵线、农民协会、妇女联合会等民主政党、团体，被无理封闭，许多民主报纸被迫停刊，大批编辑、记者被捕，监狱里充满了朝鲜爱国者。一九四七年后半年，南朝鲜的十八个监狱中拘禁了二万六千四百十二人。即使在一九四二年日本人统治下，整个朝鲜的犯人总数也不过二万三千七百二十八人。用以镇压南朝鲜人民的警察，已增至三万人，而在日本统治时代，全朝鲜没有一个时候超过八千名朝鲜警察与一万二千名日警。
    然而，美国的饥饿政策与恐怖统治，是无法窒息人民的抵抗的。现在，南朝鲜绝大多数人民正以不屈不挠的精神，为摆脱美国及其走狗韩奸的奴役、为争取祖国的统一、独立而斗争，正是最好的证明。从一九四六年十一月到一九四七年十月的一年中，南朝鲜工人的罢工斗争达二千三百八十八次，参加者五十八万六千七百八十六人。由共产党、人民党与新民党合并而成的南朝鲜劳动党，成为南朝鲜民族民主运动的领导者，在人民中享有极高威信。今年八月，在南朝鲜劳动党的领导下，占南朝鲜选民百分之七十七点五的六百七十万人民，不顾美国占领者及其走狗的疯狂迫害，热烈地选出了三百六十名自己的代表，参加在平壤举行的全朝鲜最高人民议会。同时，南朝鲜人民已开始进行武装斗争。人民的游击队正在发展壮大中。    （新华社）
