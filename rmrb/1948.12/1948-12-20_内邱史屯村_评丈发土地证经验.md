Neiqiu Shitun Village
Experiences in Appraising, Measuring, and Issuing Land Certificates

I. Conducting Purposeful Investigation and Research

After broadcasting the news of issuing land certificates, we simultaneously collected feedback from the masses and investigated the grading of various land types. Focusing on the land's natural conditions (soil quality, irrigation, geology), and referencing the average yield of the past four years under normal labor and fertilization conditions, we researched reasonable grades for various land types. Using this as a standard, we corrected the original grades, downgrading or upgrading them accordingly. Secondly, we investigated whether tree-shaded land (where trees within the land affect crop growth) should have its yield deducted, whether grave plots should be retained, and how to determine land rights for public and private roads, canals, and ditches. Understanding these aspects served as concrete preparation for appraising, measuring, and issuing land certificates.

The investigation methods combined individual interviews with small group meetings of three to five people, and several meetings of key cadres were also held to initially study solutions.

II. Leadership and Organization

The work should mainly rely on the village government, with the chairman of the People's Representative Assembly participating in the leadership. This organizes a committee of five to seven people for appraisal, measurement, and certificate issuance, preferably without separate selection. If key cadres are not selected, it will be inconvenient for them to carry out their work and for the People's Representative Assembly to exercise its supervision and leadership role. The committee is divided into three sections, hiring villagers to participate based on the specific circumstances of the village. The tasks of each section are allocated as follows: (1) Measurement Section: assists each household in clarifying the location of land plots, their boundaries, and conducting necessary measurements. (2) Calculation and Certificate Filling Section: responsible for converting and calculating the number of long and short mu, establishing new accounts, and filling out land certificates. This section should be further divided into groups to carry out calculations, registrations, and cross-check the lists with the households. (3) Assessment Section: resolves individual opinions regarding land grades and tree-shaded land, as well as disputes regarding land and housing ownership. Significant issues involving changes to the overall land grades should be submitted to the committee or mass meetings for discussion. In addition, the Assessment Section should hire fair and reputable individuals or cadres from the village to participate.

III. Establishing a Schedule Based on Work Content

Establishing a work schedule can avoid confusion and wasted time, and strive for initiative. To ensure that all village cadres and the masses act in unison, everyone must be informed of the schedule so they can jointly grasp the progress. This way, the masses will care about every step of the work, instead of it becoming the action of a few people.

IV. Starting from the Perspective of Developing Production

In the process, appraisal, measurement, and certificate issuance are inseparable. In order to obtain ownership, farmers are unwilling to conceal land, providing a strong guarantee for accurate land measurement. The solution to these problems must start from stabilizing and developing production. If this purpose is violated, it must be checked and corrected. For example, in Shitun Village, the irrigated land had grades that were thirteen levels higher than dry land of the same soil quality. The masses generally reflected that the grade of irrigated land was too high, and planting irrigated land was not as good as planting dry land, and some people were even unwilling to use irrigated land after filling wells. To solve this problem, the extra labor and fertilizer used on irrigated land compared to dry land of the same quality should be deducted, and then compared with dry land of the same quality to correct the land grade. If this is not done and "supporting the war" and "increasing national income" are emphasized one-sidedly, the result will inevitably hinder the development of production, and "turn irrigated land into dry land." At the same time, arbitrarily lowering the grade of irrigated land without considering the specific situation will make farmers feel that the difference between irrigated and dry land is unfair, and reduce national income. Another example is if someone else's tree shades another's land, the correct approach should be to deduct the yield of the shaded land; however, some suggested that the tree owner should compensate the yield by season, which would encourage tree owners to uproot trees, which is detrimental to the development and protection of forests. These issues need to be discussed by the masses, and a fair consensus can be reached.

V. Repeatedly Explaining the Significance and Role of Issuing Land Certificates

Thoroughly break down thoughts of "fearing another struggle" and "still wanting to struggle," stabilize people's hearts, and develop production. The filling method can be decided by each household according to their requirements, whether to fill out according to per capita basis or by entire family is up to them. Before filling, those who wish to adjust or exchange houses and land with each other are completely free to do so. After filling, they are also free to buy, sell, pawn, or gift land. After the new certificates are issued, it is declared that the old contracts are invalid. If the masses do not have sufficient understanding and are unwilling to hand them over for a while, there is no need to force them to do so. Some places use various disguised compulsory methods to force the masses to hand over and burn the old contracts, which is unnecessary. Since it is declared invalid, whether the old contract is handed over or not is meaningless, and forcing them to burn it will create a misconception.

This work must be carried out carefully and meticulously. Within the county, two or three villages can be selected to gain experience, and then a group of cadres can be drawn out to do the work. If cadres are lacking, villages can be carried out batch by batch. If there is no leadership and village cadres are asked to do it, due to the village-based thinking of the village cadres, it is easy to universally lower the land grade. If it is corrected a second time, it will be too laborious. This is what the leadership must pay attention to. According to the experience here, the entire process for a village of a hundred households takes about five or six days. Each place should decide on specific methods based on different circumstances.

### 内邱史屯村　评丈发土地证经验

　　内邱史屯村
  　评丈发土地证经验
    一、进行有目的的调查研究
    把发土地证消息广播出去后，一面搜集群众反映，一面调查各种地等级评定情况。以土地的自然条件（土质、水利、地质）为主，参考当地近四年一般用工施肥条件下的当年产量，研究出各种地的合理地级，以此为准，订正各种地的原来地级，依之下降或提高。其次调查研究树糊地（即地内长树影响禾苗生长）是否扣产量？是否留坟地？公私道路渠沟等地权如何确定？了解这些作为评丈填发土地证的具体准备。
    调查的方法，是个别访问与三五人的小会相结合，还得召开几个主要干部会初步研究处理办法。
    二、领导组织
    主要应依托村政府进行工作，并请人代会主席参加领导，这样组织起五人至七人的评丈发证委员会，最好不另选。因主要干部如落选，在进行工作上和发挥人代会的监督与领导作用上，都有不便之处。委员会下分设三股，根据村中具体情况聘请村民参加。各股任务分配：（一）丈量股：协同各户弄清土地段落四至及进行必要的丈量。（二）核算填证股：负折合核算长短亩数、另立新帐、填土地证等工作，下应分设组，分头进行核算、登记、将清单与户主校对等工作。（三）评议股：解决个别有关地级和树糊地的意见，及有关土地房屋所有权的纠纷等。涉及较重大的问题，有关整个地级变动者，应提交委员会或群众会讨论，另外，评议股还应聘请村中公正有威信的人士或干部参加。
    三、根据工作内容订出日程
    订出了工作日程即可避免紊乱和浪费时间，争取主动，为了使全村干群一致行动起来，一定让大家都知道进行日程，共同掌握进行。这样群众就会关心工作的每一步骤；不致成为少数人的行动。
    四、从发展生产观点出发
    在进行中，评级、丈量、发证三者不可分，农民为了取得所有权，就不愿隐瞒地，这给确实丈量土地以有力保证。对于这些问题的解决，必须从安定和发展生产出发。如有违犯此目的，即须检查改正。如史村屯的井浇地，有比同土质旱地高出十三级者，群众普遍反映水地级高，种水地不如种旱地，且有个别填井不愿用水浇地者。对此问题的解决，应把种水地比同质旱地多用之工、肥等消耗扣除，然后再与同质旱地相较订正地级。如不这样，片面提“支援战争”，“增加国家收入”等，结果必然阻碍了生产的发展，而“变水地为旱地”。同时如不顾具体情况，而任意降低水地等级，又会使农民感到水旱地差额不公，使国家收入减少。又如其他人的树糊了另一家的地，正确办法应是扣除被糊地产量；但有的提出叫树主按季赔偿产量，这样就会促使树主刨树，对发展和保护林木不利。这些问题都需经过群众讨论，大家认为公道即可作定论。
    五、反复说明发土地证的意义与作用
    彻底打破“怕再斗”、“还想斗”等思想，安定人心发展生产。填法可按各户要求，自己决定，按人分填和全家伙填，可以随便。未填前愿互相调剂兑换房屋土地者，一律自由。填写后愿买卖典当赠送者，也随便。新证发后，声明旧契作废，如群众认识不够一时不愿交出，也不必硬要他交。有些地方用各种变相强迫办法叫群众交出旧契烧毁，这是不必要的，因既声明作废，旧契交不交即没什么意义，强迫烧掉，反会造成错觉。
    这一工作的进行，必须慎重细致，县内可先作二三村，取得经验，然后抽出一批干部去作。干部如缺少，可一批一批村庄进行。如无领导的叫村干去作，因村干的村本位思想，易普遍降低地级，如再二次订正，就太费力了，这是领导上必须注意的。根据这里经验，百户之村，整个过程约需五六天，各地应根据不同情况，具体决定作法。
