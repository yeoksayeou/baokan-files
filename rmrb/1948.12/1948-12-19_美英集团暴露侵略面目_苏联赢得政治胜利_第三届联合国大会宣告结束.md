Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 17th: TASS, Paris: The Third United Nations General Assembly, which began on September 21, ceased work on the evening of December 12, pending its resumption at the United Nations Headquarters at Lake Success, New York, on April 1 of next year. Before the end of the last meeting, UN Secretary Lie, representatives of major countries, and the President of the Assembly, Australian Foreign Minister Evatt, all delivered speeches. Dulles of the United States, Schuman of France, and others, in their speeches, exhausted all means to try to reduce the adverse impression created on world opinion as a result of the United States' extensive use of arbitrary policies. They expressed feigned admiration for the results of this session of the General Assembly. Dulles even said that the Paris meeting created miracles, without even a single failure. Such irresponsible words are extremely hypocritical. The head of the Soviet delegation, Vyshinsky, in his speech, summarized the results of this session of the General Assembly, stating that the Soviet delegation could not echo praise for the results of the meeting. Because the "majority," which obediently followed the lead of the United States and Britain, prevented many measures that the General Assembly should have adopted, aimed at consolidating international cooperation and strengthening peace and security. The rejection of the Soviet proposal on the prohibition of atomic weapons and the disarmament of one-third of the five major powers within one year is an example. These proposals of the Soviet delegation are in line with the interests of all peace-loving nations, and they express the wishes of hundreds of millions of people who strive for peace and hate war. The "majority" in the General Assembly rejected these proposals, obviously because these proposals violated the interests of the pursuers of world hegemony and the instigators of new wars against the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries. The "majority" in the General Assembly also passed a batch of resolutions that blatantly violated the UN Charter, especially the decision to extend the illegal organization of the Standing Committee (i.e., the notorious "Little General Assembly"); the decision to extend the activities of the "Balkan Committee" and the Greek question; the decision on the approval of new UN members, which contained recommendations that violated the Charter's provisions on the principle of unanimity among the major powers; and the decision on the Korean question that was just passed today. There is no basis for boasting when recalling these decisions. Vyshinsky concluded by saying that the Third General Assembly wrote an ugly page in the history of the United Nations, in which the "majority" of countries attempted to rudely interfere in the internal affairs of other countries and infringe upon their sovereignty. In this way, can we still talk about any contribution or achievement of this session of the General Assembly? No, we cannot. The General Assembly has not shouldered the primary task of consolidating peace and has not promoted international cooperation on the solid basis of the Charter.

In addition: The heads of the Soviet, Ukrainian, and Belarusian delegations to the UN General Assembly, Vyshinsky, Manuilsky, Kishilev, and others, have returned home by plane on the 13th after the UN General Assembly ceased work.

　　美英集团暴露侵略面目
  　苏联赢得政治胜利
    第三届联合国大会宣告结束
    【新华社陕北十七日电】塔斯社巴黎讯：九月二十一日开始的第三届联合国大会，已于十二月十二日晚停止工作，以待明年四月一日在纽约成功湖的联合国总部复会。在最后一次会议结束之前，联合国秘书莱氏、各大国代表及大会主席澳外长伊瓦特均发表演说。美国的杜勒斯、法国的舒曼等，在发言中用尽了一切办法，企图缩小由于美国广泛使用专断政策的结果，对世界舆论所造成的不良印象。他们对本届大会的结果表示假意的钦佩。杜勒斯甚至说，巴黎的会议创造了奇迹，连一次失败都不曾发生过。这种不负责任的话是极端虚伪的。苏代表团团长维辛斯基在演说中概述这次大会的结果称：苏联代表团对于会议的结果不能随声称赞。因为顺从地唯美国和英国的马首是瞻的“多数”，曾阻止大会应当通过的旨在巩固国际合作及加强和平与安全的许多措施。苏联关于禁止原子武器和五大国在一年之内裁军三分之一之建议的被否决，即是例证。苏联代表团的这些建议，符合一切爱好和平民族的利益，它表达了千百万力求和平、憎恨战争的人民的愿望，大会中“多数”之否决这些建议，显然是因为这些建议违反了世界霸权的追求者及反苏反人民民主国家的新战争挑拨者的利益。大会中的“多数”还通过了一批露骨地违犯联合国宪章的决定，特别是延长驻会委员会（按即臭名远扬的“小型联大”）非法机构的决定；延长“巴尔干委员会”的活动和希腊问题的决定，关于批准联合国新会员的决定，其中包含着违犯宪章关于大国一致原则规定的建议；以及今日刚刚通过的朝鲜问题的决定。人们在回忆这些决定时，就没有根据来吹嘘了。维辛斯基结语称：第三届大会在联合国历史上写下了“多数”国家企图粗暴地干涉他国内政、侵犯他国主权的丑恶的一页。这样，难道还谈得上本届大会有什么贡献与成就吗？不，谈不上。大会没有负起巩固和平的主要任务，没有在宪章的巩固基础上发扬国际合作。
    又讯：苏联、乌克兰、白俄罗斯出席联大的代表团团长维辛斯基、曼努意斯基、基什列夫等一行，在联大停止工作后，已于十三日乘飞机返国。
