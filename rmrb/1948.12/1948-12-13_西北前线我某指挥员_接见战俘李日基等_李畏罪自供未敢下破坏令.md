Xinhua News Agency, Shaanxi Central Front, 10th: Senior officers of the Hu bandits' 76th Army, including Lieutenant General Li Riji, Army Chief of Staff Gao Xiangang, 20th Division Commander Wu Yonglie, and 24th Division Commander Yu Houzhi, who were captured in the battle of Yongfeng Town, Puxian County, on the 28th of last month, have now been sent to a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army. A certain commander, amidst pressing military affairs, received them and told them to sit down and talk. Li Riji stood upright and bowed, saying, "As prisoners, we are guilty and dare not sit." Our commander said, "The People's Liberation Army treats prisoners leniently." Only then did Li and the others sit down. After the commander inquired about the situation of their families one by one, the panicked and fearful expressions of Li and the others gradually dissipated. The commander asked, "The entire 76th Army was annihilated. What are your thoughts?" Li replied, "Our soldiers had no fighting spirit, and the officers had no resolve. How could we possibly defeat the People's Liberation Army! The prevailing mentality among officers and soldiers alike was that it would be over sooner or later, and sooner or later there would only be one end: complete defeat." The commander asked, "Are you aware of the order issued by Commander-in-Chief Zhu and Deputy Commander-in-Chief Peng of the People's Liberation Army to punish war criminals?" Li replied, "I heard it on the radio. Although Mr. Hu (bandit chief Hu Zongnan) had earlier ordered us to destroy our weapons in case of emergency, I did not issue any order to destroy weapons. I request an investigation." The commander said, "During the War of Resistance Against Japan, you resolutely carried out the orders of Jiang and Hu, opposing communism and the people. Later, you actively participated in the attack on Yan'an and subsequent battles, destroying the border areas and harming the people. Until now, your crimes are numerous. This time, as long as an investigation proves that you indeed did not issue an order to destroy weapons, you can still receive lenient treatment from the People's Liberation Army. However, among the six mountain guns we seized, there are still two missing sights, two sets of aiming mirrors, and other parts. Did you order this?" Li replied, "No, I can order Battalion Commander Dong of the artillery battalion to hand them all over." At this point, Li immediately wrote a letter to the battalion commander: "Please hand over the aiming mirrors, sights, and other parts in full. Do not hide them. Otherwise, the People's Liberation Army will punish you according to the order for punishing war criminals." After Li Riji finished writing, the commander continued to ask, "What is your opinion of Chiang Kai-shek's strategic guidance?" Li replied, "The Nanjing Ministry of National Defense cannot even speak of any strategic guidance." The commander then asked, "Have you read Chairman Mao's Ten Military Principles?" Li replied, "I have read them. Chairman Mao's strategic guidance is brilliant, and the Kuomintang simply has no way to deal with it. Taking the Northwest battlefield as an example, Deputy Commander-in-Chief Peng not only commands the People's Liberation Army but also commands Hu Zongnan." He continued, "When your unit launched an attack on the 90th Army in Shenyang, Chen Wu (Hu bandit's 90th Army Commander) reported that there were six columns. Our troops rushed to reinforce. When your army attacked from the west, my troops were again transferred to the west to block. Running back and forth, we were beaten everywhere, and we were simply fighting a muddled battle. Your artillery fire was very fierce. I hid in the shelter and did not come out. All levels completely lost control." After the conversation, Li Riji immediately wrote to his wife, saying: The People's Liberation Army is indeed lenient towards prisoners of war.

    西北前线我某指挥员
    接见战俘李日基等
    李畏罪自供未敢下破坏令
    【新华社陕中前线十日电】上月二十八日于蒲县永丰镇战斗中被俘之胡匪七十六军中将军长李日基、军参谋长高宪岗、二十师师长吴永烈、二十四师师长于厚之等高级军官，现已送到解放军某部，某指挥员于军务匆忙中接见他们，并吩咐他们坐下谈话。李日基端立鞠躬说：“当了俘虏，有罪不敢坐。”我指挥员说：“人民解放军宽待俘虏。”李等始坐下。指挥员逐一问过他们的家眷情形后，李等惊慌畏惧的神情始渐消释。指挥员问：“七十六军全军覆灭，你们有何感想？”李答：“我们是兵无斗志，官无决心，怎样能打得过解放军呢！不论官兵，普遍的心理就是早打早完，晚打晚完，早晚只有一个完。”指挥员问：“你知道人民解放军朱总司令、彭副总司令颁布的惩处战争罪犯的命令吗？”李答：“我从广播中听过。胡先生（匪酋胡宗南）虽早有命令，要我们在危急时一定要破坏武器，但我没有下过破坏武器的命令，请求调查。”指挥员说：“你在抗日战争中，就坚决执行蒋胡的命令，反共反人民，后又积极参加进攻延安及此后的历次战役，破坏边区，残害人民，直到现在，你的罪恶是不少的。此次，只要经过调查，证明你确实没下过破坏武器的命令，还可以受到解放军的宽大待遇。但是，在我们缴获的六门山炮中，尚缺两个表尺，两付瞄准镜及其他零件，是否是你下的命令？”李答：“不是，我可以叫炮兵营董营长如数交出。”至此，李乃当场写信给该营长：“请将瞄准镜表尺及其他零件如数交出，不得隐藏，否则，解放军将按惩处战犯命令予以处分。”待李日基写完后，指挥员继续发问：“你对蒋介石的战略指导看法如何？”李答：“南京国防部根本谈不到什么战略指导。”指挥员又问：“你们读过毛主席的十大军事原则吗？”李答：“读到过。毛主席的战略指导是英明的，国民党简直没有办法。以西北战场来讲，彭副总司令不但指挥解放军，还指挥了胡宗南。”他接着说：“贵部在沈阳对九十军施行攻击时，陈武（胡匪九十军军长）报告说是六个纵队。我们的部队就赶紧增援。及至贵军从西面来打，我的部队又调到西面去堵。跑来跑去，到处挨打，我们简直是打糊涂仗。贵军的炮火非常猛烈，我躲在掩蔽部，没有出来过，各级都完全失掉了掌握。”谈话结束后，李日基立即给他妻子写信说：解放军对俘虏确实宽大。
