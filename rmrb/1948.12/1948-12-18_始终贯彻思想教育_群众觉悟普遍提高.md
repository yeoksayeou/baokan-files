　　Consistently Implement Ideological Education
  　Mass Awareness Universally Improved
    Throughout the entire process, ideological mobilization was consistently implemented, and the political awareness of the masses has also significantly improved. They have a further understanding of the Party's policies and universally reflect that the Communist Party keeps its word and corrects its mistakes when they are made. As a result, the relationship between the Party and the masses has become even closer through this end of the land reform, and the enthusiasm of the masses for production and becoming prosperous has greatly increased. According to statistics from sixteen villages, more than 140 households have formulated long-term production and prosperity development plans. Of the more than 200,000 mu of autumn land in the county, except for cotton fields and a small number of lands that cannot actually be cultivated, all the rest have been autumn-tilled, and more than 20,000 mu have been plowed twice, with some having received base fertilizer. Increasing livestock is even more common.
    Secondly, more than 1,200 cadres, party members, and activists who were systematically trained by the county were the backbone force for completing this end of land reform, relying on this group of backbones to unite and mobilize the broad masses. Attention was also paid to cultivating and promoting cadres during the movement. A total of eighty-five cadres were promoted throughout the county, effectively strengthening the leadership for future work.
    For example, compensation to wrongly struggled middle peasants reaching over one-half of their original level accounted for 74.8 percent of the total number of households to be compensated, while those below one-half accounted for 25.3 percent; and those of landlords and rich peasants resettled at over one-half of the original level accounted for only 19.6 percent of the total number of households to be resettled, while those below one-half accounted for 84.4 percent. (Which villages are these statistics from? What is the living and production situation of these households "below one-half level"? Is this level sufficient to maintain life and enable them to engage in production? More reporting can be done – Editor) Some cadres were unwilling to correct the class status of wrongly struggled households. In mobilizing middle peasants to voluntarily relinquish land, some did not truly implement the principle of voluntariness, and some cadres even believed that "to be truly voluntary, they cannot relinquish." Some feared that "if they are not voluntary" they would not do middle peasant work, emphasizing "compensating fully to fill the gaps," so that truly laboring middle peasants who started from scratch were not compensated to a certain level. This is a manifestation of unclear policy thinking, and therefore there are still deviations in implementation.
    Based on the above situation, in the winter production movement, it is necessary to continue to deepen the ideological mobilization of the masses, conduct education on the future of farmers, and call for organization to develop production and become prosperous; the deviations in individual villages must be corrected, the remaining problems in the twenty-five villages must be specifically resolved, land certificates must be universally issued, and the masses must be further mobilized to develop production and become prosperous.

### 始终贯彻思想教育　群众觉悟普遍提高

　　始终贯彻思想教育
  　群众觉悟普遍提高
    在整个过程中，始终贯彻了思想发动，群众的政治觉悟也有显著提高，对党的政策有了进一步的认识，普遍反映：共产党说到做到，作错了就纠正。因而，党群关系也经过这次结束土改而更加密切了，群众的生产发家情绪也大大提高了。据十六个村的统计，即有一百四十多户，订出了长期生产发家的建设计划。全县二十多万亩秋地，除棉花地及少数实际上不能耕的地以外，其余全部进行了秋耕，并有二万余亩犁了两遍，部分的已上了底肥。增加牲口更是普遍现象。
    其次，全县有计划有步骤集训了的一千二百多个干部党员和积极分子，是完成这次结束土改的骨干力量，依靠这批骨干团结与发动了广大群众。在运动中并注意了培养与提拔干部，全县共提拔了八十五个干部，有效地健全了今后工作的领导。
    如给误斗中农补偿到水平二分之一以上的占应补偿总户数的百分之七十四点八，水平二分之一以下的占百分之二十五点三；而安置地富在水平二分之一以上的仅占应安置总户数的百分之十九点六，水平二分之一以下的占百分之八十四点四。（这是几个村的统计？所谓在“水平二分之一以下”的这些户，其生活与生产状况如何？这种水平是否足以维持生活并使其能进行生产？可继续做报导——编者）有的干部不愿给误斗户订正成份，在发动中农自让土地中，有的没有真正的贯彻了自愿原则，甚至有的干部认为“要真正自愿，就不能自让”；有的怕“不自愿”即不做中农工作，强调“尽补顶补窟窿”，使真正劳动起家的误斗中农，未能补足到一定水平。这是政策思想不明确的表现，因而在执行中仍有偏差。
    根据以上情况，在冬季生产运动中必须继续深入群众的思想发动，进行农民前途教育，号召组织起来生产发家；个别村的偏向必须纠正，二十五个村的遗留问题必须具体解决，普遍填发土地证，进一步发动群众生产发家。（县委办公室）
