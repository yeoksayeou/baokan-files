    Cai Chang
    Member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, from Xiangxiang, Hunan. After the May Fourth Movement in 1919, she and Comrade Xiang Jingyu organized a women's work-study group to study in France and engage in the women's movement. In 1921, she joined the French branch of the Communist Youth League and became a Communist Party member in 1922. In 1924, she studied in Moscow. The following year she returned to China to participate in the Great Revolution, leading many women's movements in Hong Kong, Shanghai, Guangdong, and Hankou. She participated in the 25,000-li Long March. Cai Chang also enjoys high prestige in the international women's movement. She has attended meetings convened by the Women's International Democratic Federation twice and was elected Vice-Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Women's International Democratic Federation. This time, she was again invited to participate in the Second International Women's Congress and was again elected Vice-Chairman of the Women's International Democratic Federation.

  Pyongyang
    It is a large city in northern Korea, located on the north bank of the Daedong River. There are many historical sites in the city, the most famous of which is the Tomb of Gija. Gija once established his capital here in ancient times. It is now the seat of the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

  Syngman Rhee
    He is the number one Korean traitor and a notorious running dog of American imperialism. He lived in the United States for twenty years, nurtured by American capitalists and reactionary Catholic missionary societies. After the Soviet army liberated Korea, Syngman Rhee took the opportunity to return to the country in October 1945 and acted as the number one puppet in South Korea under the instigation of the United States. One million US dollars of his activity expenses were provided by the American Oriental Mining Company, on the condition of obtaining mining rights in North Korea. The Korean "Democratic Party" and "Independence Promotion Association," which are closely related to him, are mostly Korean traitors, reactionaries, and large landlords who cooperated with Japan in the past. Disregarding the opposition of the Korean people, the United States formed a puppet government in South Korea in July of this year and made Syngman Rhee the "President," creating division and opposing the Soviet Union and the people. However, Syngman Rhee's ruling foundation is built on the bayonets of American troops and the whips of police and gendarmes. Since a guard brigade in Yeosu Harbor, South Korea, staged a glorious uprising in mid-October to oppose the stationing of American troops, the armed struggle in South Korea has been unfolding universally, and Syngman Rhee's bloody rule has reached the brink of collapse.

  Hyderabad
    Abbreviated as "Hai Bang," it is the largest native state in India, inhabited by various ethnic groups, with a population of over 16 million, located in southern India. The ruling class—landlords, officials, etc.—are Hindustanis, accounting for only 10% of the population of Hai Bang. Due to the support of British imperialism, they refused to join the Indian Federation, but later the ruling class of Hai Bang finally surrendered, and Hai Bang was merged into Hindustan. At the same time, the peasant movement in Hai Bang under the leadership of the Indian Communist Party is developing day by day. Now, more than 2,000 villages with a population of 5 million have been liberated from the old rule, and liberated areas have been established. The landlords' land has been distributed to landless and land-poor peasants.

  Pakistan
    In order to facilitate its rule over India, British imperialism divided India into two. Pakistan is one of the "Indian Federation" autonomous territories (the other is Hindustan), with Jinnah as Governor-General and Prime Minister. It includes the eastern part of Bengal Province, the southwestern part of Punjab Province, and the provinces of Sindh, Balochistan, and Assam, which are inhabited by Muslims.
