    A Few Suggestions on Cadre Study
    Ding Kun

    Since July, various regions and departments have successively conducted studies of the Four Great Documents (namely, "Left-Wing Communism: An Infantile Disorder Chapter 2 and its Preface," "Lenin on How Soviet Staff Should Work," "Instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in 1948 on Land Reform and Party Consolidation," "The Current Tasks of the North China Liberated Area"). In August, some areas added the study of the Nine-Nation Information Bureau and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's two resolutions on the issue of the Yugoslav Communist Party. Thanks to the serious efforts of leading organs at all levels in guiding this movement, significant achievements have been made, and many issues have been raised. On November 26, the North China Bureau issued a decision on the education of cadres in service, calling for a planned and systematic development of education and learning of the basic theories of Marxism-Leninism. Therefore, if we can thoroughly review and summarize the past study and draw experience from it, I think it will definitely be helpful for participating in or leading new studies. Below, I will only talk about a few issues seen from reviewing reports on studies in various places, hoping to elicit valuable opinions and provide everyone with reference for study and discussion.
  (1) Are there still obstacles to carrying out a conscious study movement?

    In principle, it should be said that this is not a problem. The situation is one of unprecedented victory, and our cadres are extremely lacking in knowledge in all aspects, such as policy, theory, and even culture. The Party Constitution also stipulates that study is the duty of every Party member. However, from the following materials, we can see that this problem exists in various places: The Political Department of the Military Region, in leading and organizing cadre study, found that the idea that "the situation is developing too fast, studying theory is too far-fetched" is quite common. The PingShun County Party Committee's inspection of study in August found the following problems in the study attitudes of county and district cadres: "We can do this work without learning anything?" "Learning something is not useful in work." Some even think: "No matter how much I study, I can't solve my family's difficulties." Therefore, they adopt a passive attitude towards study. The Ji'nan Second Prefectural Committee's study summary reflects the same situation: "I have no culture, I can't learn it, it's useless to learn when I'm old, and I still have to go home when streamlining." The JiZhong Guide reported on October 28: "Most counties regard the leadership of study as a task to be completed. The Party committee cadres above the county level mostly just call on others to study, but do not study themselves. According to a survey of ×× counties, only one-third can persist in studying every day. ......” Some cadres in ×× County are not interested in studying documents, but are interested in "The Biography of JiGong" and "Dream of the Red Chamber." .........

    From these materials, it can be seen that many of our cadres are still blinded by empiricism in their studies, always thinking: "Work is more important than study." "There are ways to work, why study?" "Haven't we still mobilized the masses without memorizing dogma?" This empiricist way of thinking is reflected in the leadership as only organizing everyone to study, but not guiding everyone ideologically; The Taihang Fifth Prefectural Committee's study inspection said: From the Propaganda Department to the various branches of the organs, the leadership of study is tightly grasping organizational leadership, emphasizing time and speed, but ideological leadership is not enough, and even individual study committees have not even read the documents themselves, but gather everyone to discuss them. Even worse, they only assign tasks but do not check, but demand tasks and reports when the time comes. This shows that if we want to raise study and work to an equally important position, as the North China Bureau's decision on the education of cadres in service said, to carry it out as a task, then we must: First, every Party member must recognize the importance of theoretical study, earnestly improve themselves from study, in order to overcome empiricism. Second, it is necessary to follow the regulations of the North China Bureau: "The head of the organ is personally responsible," studying himself, teaching others to study, implementing ideological guidance, and arousing everyone's enthusiasm for study. Only in this way can we defeat the first enemy of study - complacency.
  (2) Liberate ourselves from empiricist study methods.

    It should be admitted that the study in the past period had its successful aspects: this is mainly reflected in the fact that all organs can check their work based on documents, improve meeting reporting and other systems, eliminate some corruption and waste, and further adopt a serious and responsible attitude in their work style. But at the same time, it should not be denied that, due to being bound by some empiricist study methods, our gains have been insufficient. The article of the Nine-Nation Information Bureau on the situation of the Yugoslav Communist Party is not easy to study because it is a foreign thing. Precisely because of this, when studying this thing, we should first clarify the situation of this country from the document (including class relations, revolutionary stage, revolutionary nature, etc.), and then we can further study the mistakes of the Tito group (including the recognition of the difference between socialist countries and capitalist countries, denying the importance of international assistance, denying class struggle and the leadership role of the proletariat, denying party leadership, democratic centralism, and self-criticism and criticism, etc.), and analyze the source and consequences of these errors. Only by fully understanding this document and comparing it with our own thoughts and work can we benefit. However, the method we generally use is to grab a point from it and connect it with reality. For example, when some organs study this document, they only seize the point that Tito abandoned the leadership of the proletariat and connect it with "taking the poor peasant and farm laborer line, forgetting the leadership of the proletariat, and mistakenly believing that poor peasants and farm laborers are above all else." This method of connection is fragmented and incomplete. Such a connection method will hinder our comprehensive and profound understanding of the mistakes of the Tito group and gain real benefits from it.

    The same situation can also be seen in the summaries of studies in many places. On the one hand, it is true that checking the undisciplined and anarchic state of work based on documents has played a certain role in establishing and strengthening work systems and rectifying work styles, but on the other hand, the ideological awareness of establishing and implementing systems has not been raised to the proper level. If we examine the reasons, we should also admit that it is bound by the empiricist way of thinking. There is a common saying among cadres: "Big principles cannot solve my specific problems." In fact, it is precisely because you do not understand the big principles that you cannot solve specific problems. This kind of thinking is extremely harmful and obstructs ideological progress. If you want to truly improve from study, you must first understand the big principles. If you understand the big principles, the scope of connection will be expanded. If you can only see a little bit, that is very insufficient. The North China Bureau's decision on the education of cadres in service emphasizes systematic and planned theoretical study, which is aimed at the past studies' one-sidedness and empiricist methods and should attract our attention.
  (3) Correctly use tests to promote study.

    In the recent period of study, the method of testing has been used very commonly. From the tests, not only has the leadership been able to specifically understand the cadres' policy and theoretical level, but it has also greatly promoted the cadres' enthusiasm for study. The People's Daily published a special article on this on October 26, pointing out that testing is a good method to promote cadre study. However, some places have some deviations in the application, such as some organs helping some people memorize phrases and drill for terms after the tests, which must be prevented. If we can only recite the words and sentences of the Party's general line and general policy, but do not know how to apply them in actual work, what is the use even if we can answer the test? Leaders should pay attention not to guide in this direction, but should guide learners to be able to use theory to solve or explain practical problems.

    The methods of testing in various places generally include two types: one is sudden, without prior notice, and questions are asked temporarily. This method can check the scale of learning and is quite stimulating. One is to conduct a test after studying a section. The direct purpose of the test is to check the degree of acceptance of the study. The two methods can be flexibly adopted.
  (4) Study should be "drilled", and time should be "squeezed".

    Various places have raised the issue of insufficient study time in the study of cadres in service, and unanimously believe that it is easier for organ cadres to squeeze out two hours, but it is very difficult for cadres who go to the countryside. According to my understanding, the difficulty for cadres who go to the countryside is not that they cannot squeeze out time, but that they lack the ability to self-study (the cultural level is too low). Cadres with a real cultural level can still squeeze out time in the countryside as long as they have the determination to study. As long as there is determination, there is no difficulty that cannot be overcome. The so-called "no time" and "busy with work" are just euphemisms for laziness. As for cadres with low cultural level and lack of self-study ability, in addition to inspiring their initiative and enthusiasm, the leadership must also provide planned assistance.

    In short, study is a hard work. Marx, Engels, and many leading comrades of our Party have tirelessly read many books in order to find weapons for class struggle. The current situation is one of national victory. What victory brings is not comfort but more arduous responsibilities and more complex struggles. If we still cannot obtain some weapons from the study of basic Marxist-Leninist theory and Mao Zedong Thought, then we will not know how many difficulties we will encounter, and we will not be able to well meet the situation of national victory. The North China Bureau issued a special decision for this purpose. We should resolutely act for the Party's call and launch a warm study movement in the whole Party.

### 对干部学习的几点意见

    对干部学习的几点意见
    丁昆
    从七月份以来，各地各部门都曾先后进行了四大文件的学习（即：“左派幼稚病第二章及其前言”、“列宁论苏维埃机关人员应如何工作”、“中共中央一九四八年关于土改工作与整党工作的指示”、“华北解放区当前任务”），八月份。有些地方又增加了九国情报局与中共中央关于南共问题的两个决议的学习。由于各级领导机关在这个运动的领导上，都曾做过认真的努力，获得了不少成绩，提出的问题也不少。十一月二十六日，华北局又发出关于在职干部教育的决定，号召有计划有系统地开展马克思、列宁主义的基本理论的教育与学习。因此，如果能很好的回顾与总结一下过去的学习，并从中取得经验，我想对于参加或领导新的学习来讲，是一定有帮助的。下面只讲从翻阅各地学习报导材料中看到的几个问题，抛砖引玉，提供大家作为学习讨论的参考。
  （一）开展自觉的学习运动，是否还有障碍？
    按道理讲，应该说这并不能算个问题，目前是空前胜利的形势，我们的干部又是十分缺乏政策、理论以至文化等各方面的知识，党章上并早有明文规定，学习是每个党员的义务。但从以下的材料中看，就可以知道，这个问题在各地是存在着的：军区政治部在领导与组织干部学习中，发现“形势发展得太快，学理论太迂远。”的思想相当普遍。平顺县委八月份检查学习，发现县区干部的学习态度上有以下的问题：“咱做这点工作吧，不学习还怕做不了？”“学习一点东西，工作中也用不着。”还有的甚至想：“怎样学习也解决不了家庭困难。”因而对学习采取消极态度。冀南二地委的学习总结中，反映同样的情况：“自己没文化，学也学不成，学老了也不中用，精简时还得回家。”冀中导报十月二十八日的学习报导：“大部分县份对学习领导上是抱着完成任务的观点。县以上的党委干部，绝大多数是光号召别人学习，自己学习却不沾。根据××个县的调查，每日能坚持学习的不过三分之一。………”××县有的干部对文件学习没兴趣，却把兴趣放在济公传和红楼梦上。………
    从这些材料中可以看出，我们有不少干部在学习中还受经验主义的蒙蔽，总认为：“工作比学习重要。”“工作有办法，何必学习？”“没有背过教条，还不是照样发动了群众？”这种经验主义思想方法反映在领导上就是只从组织上布置大家学习，而不从思想上引导大家学习；太行五地委的学习检查中说：自宣传部到各机关支部对学习的领导是组织领导抓的紧，强调时间和速度抓的紧，但思想领导是不够的，甚至有个别学委会自己连文件都没看，却集合大家一块讨论。还有更坏的情况是：只布置，不检查，到时候却要任务、要报告。这就说明了我们要想把学习与工作提到同等重要地位，如象华北局在职干部教育决定中所说的当作一个任务去进行，那就必须：第一是每个党员必须认识理论学习的重要，认真的从学习中提高自己，以克服经验主义。第二是必需按照华北局的规定：“由机关首长亲自负责”，自己学，教别人学，贯彻思想引导，鼓起大家学习情绪，只有这样我们才能打败学习的第一个敌人——自满。
  （二）从经验主义的学习方法中解放出来。
    应该承认，过去一段的学习是有其成功的一方面的：这主要表现在各个机关均能依据文件，检查工作，健全了会议汇报等制度，消灭了一些贪污浪费，在工作作风上能进一步采取严肃认真的态度等。但同时也不应否认，由于我们受了一些经验主义学习方法的束缚，因而我们的收获就很不够。九国情报局对南共状况的决议这篇文章不大好学习，原因是它是外国的东西。正因为这样，我们在学习这篇东西时，就应首先从文件中把这个国家的情况弄清楚（包括阶级关系，革命阶段，革命性质等各方面），而后才能进一步去研究铁托集团的错误（包括对社会主义国家与资本主义国家的区别的认识，否认国际援助的重要，否认阶级斗争与无产阶级的领导作用，否认党的领导、民主集中制，及自我批评与批评等各方面），并分析这种错误的来源及其恶果等。只有把这个文件做到了全面的理解，对照检查我们自己的思想与工作，才能得益。但我们一般习用的方法却是从其中抓到一点便去联系实际，如有的机关在学习这一文件时，只抓住铁托放弃无产阶级领导这一点，便联系到“走贫雇路线，是忘了无产阶级领导，误认为贫雇高于一切。”这种联系方法就是片断的，不完全的，这样的联系方法会障碍我们全面深刻的认识铁托集团的错误，并从中取得真正的益处。
    同样的情况还可以在许多地方学习的总结中看到。一方面由于根据文件检查了工作中无纪律无政府状态，对于建立与加强工作制度，整顿工作作风确是起了一定作用的，但另一方面，对于建立与执行制度的思想自觉，则没有提到应有高度，如果检查原因的话，同样应该承认是受了经验主义思想方法的束缚。干部中间有一句常流行的话：“大道理解决不了我的具体问题。”其实正是因为自己没有懂得了大道理，因此也就无法解决具体问题。这种思想是极端有害的，是阻塞思想进步的，要想真正从学习中提高，就必须先懂得大道理。懂了大道理再联系，联系的范围就扩大了，如果只能看到片鳞半爪的一点，那是很不够的。华北局在职干部教育决定中，强调有系统有计划进行理论学习，正是针对着过去学习中的片面性与经验主义的方法而言的，应引起我们的注意。
  （三）正确运用测验，推动学习。
    在最近一时期的学习中，测验的方法运用得很普遍，从测验中不只帮助领导上具体的了解了干部的政策理论水平，而且大大的推动了干部的学习热情，人民日报对此曾于十月二十六日发表专论，指出测验是推动干部学习的良好方法。但有些地方在运用中发生了一些偏向，如有的机关在进行了测验后，助长了一些扣字句、钻名词的空气、必须注意防止。如我们只能背诵党的总路线总政策的条文字句，而不知道如何在实际工作中去运用的话，即使测验时答得出来，又有什么用处呢？领导者应该注意不要向这个方向引导，而应引导学习者能够运用理论来解决或解释实际问题。
    各地测验的方法，一般的有两种：一种是突然性的，事先不通知，临时出题，这种方法可以检查学习尺度，刺激性不小。一种是学习到一段落，进行测验，测验的直接目的，是为了检查学习的接受程度。两种方法可以灵活采用。
  （四）学习要“钻”，时间要“挤”。
    各地在职干部学习中，均曾提出学习时间不够的问题，而且一致认为机关干部挤两小时还好办，下乡干部则甚困难。依据我的了解，下乡干部的困难不是挤不出时间，而是缺乏自修的能力（文化太低），真正有文化水平的干部，只要有学习决心，下乡中也同样是能挤出时间的。只要有了决心，就没有不能克服的困难。所谓“没时间”“工作忙”，只是偷懒的代名词。至于对于文化水平低，而缺乏自修能力的干部，除了启发他的自动性与积极性外，还必须领导上给以有计划的帮助。
    总之，学习是个苦功夫，马克思、恩格斯以及我们党的许多领导同志，为了寻取阶级斗争的武器，都曾不厌倦地读过许多书。目前是全国胜利的形势，胜利所带来的不是安乐而是更加艰巨的责任与更加复杂的斗争，如果我们还不能从马列主义基本理论与毛泽东思想的学习中取得一些武器的话，那我们将不知道会遇到多少困难，我们就将不能很好的迎接全国胜利的局面。华北局为此发出专门决定，我们应该为党的号召而坚决行动起来，在全党开展一个热烈的学习运动。
