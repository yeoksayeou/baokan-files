Taihang News: The Fifth Military Sub-district, due to insufficient work in current affairs propaganda and education, has failed to rapidly improve the masses' political awareness alongside the victorious development of the war. To address this, the district committee, based on instructions from the regional party committee, conducted a concentrated and systematic current affairs propaganda campaign from November 25th to December 5th. In terms of leadership ideology, it was regarded as the key to promoting current work and raising mass awareness. The outline and initial experiences of the work are as follows:

　　I. Overview of the Current Affairs Propaganda Campaign
　　First, current affairs learning was conducted among cadres. Responsible comrades in each county, in conjunction with expanded cadre meetings or training classes, explained and reported on current affairs, and organized special discussions and learning so that cadres could first understand and then propagate to the masses. Second, propaganda organizations (such as propaganda unions, preparatory committees, etc.) were organized to carry out preparatory work, mobilize cadres and teachers to form propaganda teams, compile propaganda materials, and mobilize all propaganda tools to carry out propaganda campaigns through means such as holding celebration meetings, door-to-door individual propaganda, and organizing mass group discussions. Weihui City, with cadres as the backbone and the participation of workers and students, organized cartoon groups, singing teams, and costumed propaganda teams to carry out a city-wide propaganda campaign. Teachers, students, rural theater troupes, blind people's teams, and quick report groups in various places were all involved in this movement. In Anyang, Lin County, and other places, people who had fled back from the Chiang-controlled areas and prisoners of war released by our army were also used to publicize to the masses the heroic and skillful fighting of our army and the miserable defeat of the Chiang bandits, which was more specific and vivid. Zhangnan and other counties also held meetings of intellectuals and puppet families to explain current affairs. According to incomplete statistics, one million people in the district have directly heard current affairs propaganda from our cadres at all levels. When the news that the Kuomintang reactionaries could be fundamentally overthrown in about a year was widely publicized, the morale of the masses and cadres was extremely high. In Hui County, 1,200 young adults voluntarily signed up to join the army in four days.

　　II. Several Gains and Experiences
　　A. Systematically, centrally, and purposefully conducting current affairs propaganda is the key to resolving the future thoughts of cadres and the masses, increasing everyone's enthusiasm for revolutionary struggle, and promoting current work such as ending land reform, winter production, joining the army, participating in the war, and working in new areas. It brings strength to cadres and the masses and strengthens their confidence and determination. Therefore, with widespread and in-depth propaganda on current affairs, other work can be rapidly advanced. However, if the political awareness of the masses is not improved accordingly, and only victory figures are simply publicized and news is disseminated, it will fuel the masses' "the revolution has succeeded, let's take a break!" weariness and paralyze the masses' will to fight.

　　B. Current affairs propaganda must be combined with other ongoing work and policy education to achieve the effect of promoting practical work.

　　C. Leading cadres taking responsibility, personally speaking, and propagandizing to the masses and to everyone is an important condition for correctly carrying out the current affairs propaganda campaign. For example, the Zhangnan District Committee and County Committee personally conducted propaganda to the masses, militia, cadres, and even the miscellaneous personnel of the county's directly subordinate organs, so that the propaganda movement quickly unfolded. Secondly, strengthening the cadres' study of current affairs and explaining the masses' difficult questions about current affairs at any time and anywhere can make the propaganda work more in-depth and solid.

　　D. Using concrete examples and the masses' own political experience to focus on sharply exposing the enemy's rumors can further improve the masses' political sense. At the same time, using the masses who have fled from the Chiang-controlled areas and the prisoners of war released by our army to carry out propaganda to the masses has a greater effect.

　　E. In-depth current affairs propaganda movement and improving the propaganda and education institutions in rural areas promote each other. Through current affairs propaganda, the cultural and educational institutions in various villages are also improved at the same time, thus also ensuring that current affairs education continues to be in-depth and consolidated.

　　太行五分区开展时事宣传
  　群众觉悟迅速提高
  　辉县四天千余青年参军
    【太行讯】五分区因时事宣传教育工作做的不够，以致群众的政治觉悟未能随着战争胜利发展而迅速提高，为此，地委特根据区党委的指示，从上月二十五日至本月五日进行了集中的有系统的时事宣传工作，在领导思想上把它作为推动当前工作、提高群众觉悟的关键，工作进行的概况与初步经验如下：
　　一、时事宣传运动概况
    首先是在干部中进行了时事学习，各县负责同志结合着扩干会或训练班，讲解报告时事，组织专门讨论学习，干部先弄通再向群众宣传。其次是组织宣传机构（如宣联会、筹委会等），进行筹备工作，发动干部教员组成宣传队，编写宣传材料，动员一切宣传工具，用召开庆祝大会、挨门挨户个别宣传、与组织群众小组讨论等方式，开展宣传运动。卫辉市以干部为骨干，吸收工人、学生参加，组织了漫画组、歌咏队、化装宣传队，开展了全市的宣传运动。各地学校教员、学生、农村剧团、盲人队、快报组等，都卷入了这一运动。在安阳、林县等地，还利用了从蒋区跑回的群众及我军释放回来的俘虏，把我军英勇善战与蒋匪狼狈惨败的情形向群众宣传，更具体生动。漳南等县还分别召开了知识分子会、伪属会，讲解时事。据不完全统计，全区已有一百万群众，直接听到我各级干部的时事宣传。当一年左右就可能从根本上打倒国民党反动政府的消息普遍宣传后，群众干部情绪极为高涨。辉县在四天当中，就有一千二百名青壮年自动报名参军。
　　二、几点收获与经验
    甲、系统的集中的有目的地进行时事宣传，是解决干部群众前途思想提高大家革命斗争的积极性、推动当前结束土改、冬季生产、参军参战与新区工作的关键。它给干部群众带来了力量，增强了信心与决心，因此广泛深入的宣传时事，其他工作即可迅速向前推进。但是如不根据群众政治觉悟程度而加以提高，只单纯的宣传胜利数字，进行消息性的传播，那即会助长了群众“革命成功了松一口气吧！”的疲备情绪，瘫痪了群众的斗争意志。
    乙、时事宣传必须与当前正在进行的其他工作相结合，必须与政策教育相结合，才能收到推动现实工作的效果。
    丙、首长负责亲自动嘴，向群众宣传，向一切人宣传，是正确开展时事宣传运动的重要条件。如在漳南地委、县委亲自向群众、民兵、干部以至县直属机关的杂务人员进行宣传，使宣传运动很快展开。其次是加强干部的时事学习，随时随地解释群众对时事的疑难问题，才能使宣传工作更加深入与巩固。
    丁、用具体事例用群众自身的政治经验集中的尖锐的揭发敌人的谣言，使群众政治嗅觉更加提高。同时利用从蒋区逃来的群众与我军释放回来的俘虏，给群众宣传，收效更大。
    戊、深入时事宣传运动与健全农村的宣教机构，二者是相互推动的。通过时事宣传，各村的文教机构也就同时健全起来，这样也保证时事教育继续深入巩固。
