To Adapt to the New Situation Requires Improving Ideological Level
Sixteen Thousand Rural Party Member Cadres in North China Complete Training

[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper] Party committees in various regions of North China have achieved preliminary results in training district and village cadre Party members. 160,000 rural Party member cadres have studied the Party's policies and improved their ideological understanding, and are now surging into various movements to end land reform, rectify the Party, engage in production, support the front, and join the army.

This training is the first large-scale, region-wide training in the history of the North China Party. According to incomplete statistics from existing materials, in the three months since the North China Bureau's July meeting, the number of people trained is as follows: 40,000 in Taihang, 40,373 in Central Hebei, 11,940 in Southern Hebei, 60,000 in North Yue (including training and participation in conferences), 9,374 in seventeen counties in Hebei-Shandong-Henan and Party schools, and 1,800 in Taiyue (only the first and fourth district committees). Jinzhong's new districts are not included in the count. Everyone believes that this large-scale training is well-suited to the current development of the situation and the needs of the work. The Party committees in each region are continuing to draw cadres for centralized training based on the existing foundation.

The results of this training have improved the policy and ideological level of rural Party member cadres, overcome some of their confused ideas about land reform and Party rectification, increased their enthusiasm for work, improved the relationship between Party members and the masses, strengthened the unity of new and old cadres, and also identified and promoted cadres. For example, after being trained, Taihang cadres greatly increased their ambition and revolutionary vigor, recognizing that liberating the other half of China is the responsibility of every Party member. After training in Central Hebei and Southern Hebei, cadres recognized the significance of Party rectification, their enthusiasm increased, and the relationship between new and old cadres was also improved. After returning to their villages, some North Yue trainees admitted their past mistakes at mass meetings, promoting the work of the village. Before training, among the 109 trainees in the first phase in Shouzhang, Hebei-Shandong-Henan, 53 were active, 39 were passive, and 17 were unwilling to work; after training, the number of active people increased to 101, accounting for more than 90%, the number of passive people decreased to 6, and only 2 were unwilling to work. After returning to their villages, the Jixiang village cadres did a good job in logistical support, receiving praise from the East China Field Army. In terms of promoting cadres, the Party committees in each region promoted about 10,000 trainees to become cadres detached from production. In North Yue, among the 4,000 cadres trained in June, July, and August, 660 were promoted.

The main experience gained in the training is that this kind of short-term training class with 200-300 people for ten or fifteen days is the most suitable form for training village cadres. The most basic experience in running such a short, large-scale, and demanding training class is that ideological leadership must be given top priority, and proper criticism and self-criticism must be carried out. On the one hand, the specific policy issues that urgently need to be resolved at present must be addressed, and on the other hand, a large number of rural Party member cadres with practical experience but insufficient Party education must be given basic Party knowledge education to improve their level of consciousness.

Generally speaking, the trained Party member cadres have the following three ideological situations: First, they are afraid of Party rectification and dissatisfied with it. Second, they are not clear about the policies. Third, they are worried about their families and afraid of being promoted and transferred far away. The root cause is that they do not understand the policy of Party rectification, their understanding of the Party's general policy and general line is vague, and their class consciousness is insufficient. Therefore, the leadership must first make appropriate self-criticism, boldly encourage them to raise opinions, and then explain the policy of Party rectification and land reform. Then, use vivid and concrete examples to analyze, compare, and affirm that the direction of land reform and Party rectification is basically correct and the achievements are also the main ones, explaining that the Party must be rectified and that Party rectification is the key to completing land reform, in order to guide serious self-reflection and mutual criticism, draw ideological boundaries, and then explain the steps and methods for correctly carrying out work in the future. It must be emphasized that the policy and the mass line are inseparable. Without the policy, there is no mass line; without the mass line, no correct policy is possible. To correct policy understanding, it is necessary to correct work style at the same time, and overcome coercion and commandism ideologically. It is necessary to carry out basic communist ideological education on the basis of cadres' ideological consciousness, point out the revolutionary future, mobilize historical memories through key members, and overcome the backward and conservative consciousness of Party members as peasants.

Secondly, in selecting trainees, assigning trainers, organizing leadership, and teaching methods, the leadership must consistently implement a serious spirit from the concentration of trainees, their life, learning, to the summary and evaluation. For example, in Hebei-Shandong-Henan, at the time of graduation, trainees reported what problems they had solved and their work plans for returning to the village, and the group reviewed, revised, and supplemented them. Before leaving, a general meeting was held to summarize several important issues. After the study period, Hua County listed the main issues of the study outline, allowing trainees to convey them to the branch in the village to improve the understanding of all Party members of the branch, which were all more effective.

Party Committees in Various Regions Continue to Train Cadres, and Basic Party Education Should Be Effectively Strengthened in the Future

In short, this training work has laid a good foundation for further Party rectification and the large-scale promotion of cadres in the future. At the same time, the establishment of this kind of training class is combined with the whole Party's strengthening of theoretical learning and policy learning, and therefore has particularly great results.

However, in this initial training, many places focused on the education of various specific policy and ideological issues, and quite neglected the basic communist ideological education, and did not well integrate specific issues with general principles. For example, some places simply believed that "Party rectification is to end land reform. Ending land reform is the content of Party rectification." Some places believed that Party rectification was to "rectify the exploiting class consciousness," and others said it was to "rectify corruption and degeneration." This only states a part of the content and significance. Obviously, ending land reform cannot become the entire content of Party rectification (combining Party rectification with ending land reform is correct). Simply not having exploiting consciousness cannot be regarded as the vanguard of the proletariat. If, ideologically, the proletariat cannot be distinguished from the peasants, the vanguard cannot be distinguished from the class masses, it is blurring and lowering the principled nature of Party rectification, and it is impossible to fundamentally improve the ideological understanding of Party member cadres.

After the land reform, the class relations in rural areas have undergone fundamental changes. Some rural Party member cadres believe that Japan has been defeated, Chiang Kai-shek has been driven away, and the landlord class has been eliminated, and the revolution has been successful, and they have become vague about the revolutionary future. Therefore, when conducting production education and current affairs education for them, it is necessary to strengthen the education on the revolutionary future and the education on basic communist ideology.

Due to the relaxation of basic Party education, some places have had unprincipled accommodation to the backward peasant ideas of Party members. Regarding the disunity of new and old cadres, they said: "Old cadres have merit, and new cadres also have merit," which is just an attitude of mediation, rather than raising it to the level of Party principles. What is even more wrong is to encourage Party members with old ideas, such as in order to eliminate the idea of village cadres lying down, saying: "The glory of Party members lies in being above ten thousand people." When conducting education on the revolutionary future, they said: "Defeating Chiang Kai-shek will bring permanent peace and a happy and prosperous life," and others said: "Our generation will not catch up with the success of the revolution, but we will always have a good reputation that will last forever, and our life will not be in vain." This is departing from the Party Constitution and the Party Program, and not only cannot improve the ideological understanding of Party members, but on the contrary, it lowers Party members to the level of ordinary peasants, and even leads them into the mire of feudal ideas. In the future, the leadership in various places must earnestly pay attention to and check the content of the training, and strictly abide by the principles of the Party Program and the Party Constitution to train Party members.

    适应新形势需要提高思想水平
    华北农村党员干部十六万人完成集训
    【本报特讯】华北各区党委集训区村干部党员，已获初步成绩。十六万农村党员干部，学习了党的政策，思想认识提高了一步，现已涌入结束土改与整党生产、支前、参军的各种运动中。
    此次训练，是华北党有史以来，第一次大规模的、全区普遍的训练，据现有材料不完全统计，自华北局七月会议后，三个月来，集训人数：太行为四万人，冀中四万三百七十三人，冀南一万一千九百四十人，北岳训练及参加大会学习的，达六万人，冀鲁豫十七个县与党校训练的为九千三百七十四人，太岳仅一、四两地委，为一千八百人，晋中各新区尚未计算在内。大家认为这种大规模的训练，正适合目前形势的发展与工作的需要，现各区党委，均在现有基础上继续抽调干部集中训练。
    此次训练的结果，提高了农村党员干部政策思想水平，克服了他们对土改与整党的某些糊涂观念，提高了他们工作的积极性，改进了党员与群众的关系，加强了新老干部的团结，同时也鉴别与提拔了干部。如太行干部受训后大大增长了前进心与革命的朝气，认识到解放那一半中国是每一个党员的责任。冀中、冀南训练后，干部认识了整党的意义，情绪提高了，而新老干部关系亦获得改善。北岳学员回村后，有的在群众大会上承认过去的错误，推动了村的工作。冀鲁豫寿张一期学员一○九人，受训前积极的五十三人，消极的三十九人，不干的十七人；受训后，积极的增加一○一人，占百分之九十以上，消极的减至六人，不干的只剩二人。嘉祥村干部回村后战勤搞的好，受到华野的表扬。在提拔干部上，各区党委，从受训学员中，提拔了约一万人成为脱离生产干部，北岳在六、七、八三个月训练的四千干部中，即有六百六十人被提拔。
    在训练中获得的主要经验是，这种十天半月的二三百人的短期训练班，为最适合于村干部训练的形式，而办好这种时间短、人数多、任务重的训练班，最基本的经验，是必须把思想领导放在第一位，展开正当的批评与自我批评，一方面解决当前迫切需要解决的具体政策问题，一方面给大批有实际经验但受党内教育不够的农村党员干部以党的基本知识教育，以提高其觉悟程度。
    受训党员干部，一般的有以下三种思想情况：一是怕整党，对整党不满。二是对政策不摸底。三是挂家，怕被提拔远调。其根源，是由于对整党的政策不了解，对党的总政策总路线认识模糊与阶级觉悟不够。所以领导上，必须首先自己作恰当的检讨，放手启发他们提意见，然后阐明整党土改的政策，再以生动的具体的事例，分析，对比，肯定土改整党的方针基本上是正确的，成绩也是主要的，说明党必须整，及整党是完成土改的关键，借以引导进行严肃的自我反省与相互批评，划清思想界限，随后讲明今后正确进行工作的步骤与办法。必须着重说明政策与群众路线是不可分的。离了政策，就没有群众路线；离了群众路线，任何正确的政策都是不可能的。端正政策认识，必须同时端正作风，从思想上克服强迫命令。必须在干部思想自觉的基础上，加以共产主义基本思想教育，指明革命前途，通过骨干，发动历史回忆，克服党员的农民落后保守意识。
    其次，在选送学员，指派训练人员，组织领导以及教学方法上，即从学员的集中，生活，学习，直到总结鉴定，领导上要一致地贯彻认真的精神。如冀鲁豫在毕业时，学员自报解决了什么问题，及回村工作计划，小组评议加以修正与补充，临走时再开大会总结几个重要问题；滑县在学习期满后，列出学习的主要问题提纲，让学员回村在支部传达以提高支部全体党员的认识，都是比较能收实效的。
  各区党委继续调训干部  今后应切实加强党的基本教育
    总之，此次训练工作，已为今后进一步整党，与大量提拔干部，打下了一个良好的基础；同时，这种训练班的开办，正与全党加强理论学习与政策学习相结合，因之收效特大。
    但是，在此初期训练中，许多地方，因偏重各个具体政策思想问题的教育，而相当忽略了共产主义基本思想教育，没有将具体问题与一般原则很好结合起来。如有的地方简单的认为“整党是为了结束土改。结束土改是整党的内容。”有的地方认为整党是为要“整掉剥削阶级意识”，还有的说是为了“整掉贪污腐化”的。这只是说出一部分内容与意义，很显然，结束土改，不能成为整党的全部内容（整党与结束土改结合是正确的）。单是没有剥削意识，还不能作为无产阶级先锋队。如果在思想上不能将无产阶级与农民，先锋队与阶级群众加以区别，就是模糊与降低了整党的原则性，就不能将党员干部思想认识，从根本上提高。
    土改后农村阶级关系发生根本变化，有些农村党员干部，认为日本打倒了，蒋介石打走了，地主阶级消灭了，革命已经成功，对革命前途便模糊起来。因此在对他们进行生产教育，时事教育时，必须加强革命前途的教育与共产主义基本思想的教育。
    由于放松了党的基本教育，有些地方就发生了对党员农民落后思想的无原则迁就，对新老干部不团结则说：“老干部有功，新干部也有功”，只是调解的态度，而不是提高到党的原则水平。更错误的是用旧思想鼓励党员，如有为了消除村干躺倒思想，而说：“党员的光荣在于高居于万人之上”，在进行革命前途教育时说：“打倒蒋介石就永久和平，安居乐业”，还有的说：“咱这一辈就是赶不上革命成功，总也落个美名万古传，不枉人生一世”。这是离开了党章党纲的，不但不能提高党员的思想认识，相反的，是把党员降低到普通的农民的水平，甚至引到封建思想的泥坑去。今后各地领导上对训练的内容，必须切实的注意和检查，严格遵照党纲党章的原则，来训练党员。
