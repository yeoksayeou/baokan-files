[Taihang News] Winter sideline production in Xingtai County has now been widely launched. Since the end of land reform in the county, farmers' enthusiasm for production has been even higher. They are engaged in various sideline productions. Their production avenues include handicrafts (nitrate production, weaving, mat weaving, fur processing, etc.) and transportation and sales.

In terms of nitrate production, the first and second districts are the most common. In the first district, there are more than 390 nitrate producers in 29 villages. From September to mid-December, they produced more than 6,800 catties of nitrate in total. Calculated at five catties of millet per catty, this is equivalent to more than 34,000 catties of millet. In the second district, there are 146 nitrate producers in 31 villages. From September to mid-December, they produced more than 7,500 catties of nitrate, which can earn more than 37,000 catties of millet.

Most spinning wheels and looms are in operation

The county's textile industry was relatively backward in the past and gradually developed after the War of Resistance Against Japan. This winter, after widespread appeals, many villages have started it up. In Zhehu Village, there are 94 women spinners and 77 women weavers. In 20 days, they spun 307 catties of yarn and wove more than 210 catties of cloth. All 450 spinning wheels in Yangfan are now in operation. From September to the end of October, they spun more than 6,500 catties of wool, earning 57,000 yuan in new currency; they spun more than 1,100 catties of cotton and wove 245 zhang of cloth, earning a total of more than 54,000 yuan in new currency. There are now 17 spinning machines and 41 hand-pulled shuttle looms in Qianzhang Village, District 9. Each person can weave half a catty per day with a hand-pulled shuttle loom, and each person can spin more than 1.4 catties per day with a spinning machine, which is one to two times more productive than old spinning wheels and old looms. Not only has the quantity increased, but the quality has also improved. Cooperatives in Yin Jia Township and Huoshigang Village in District 5 have also set up training classes to improve textile technology. Most of the county's spinning wheels and looms are in operation.

Mat weaving is most common in the first and ninth districts, and the income is also considerable. For example, in Daoqi Village, District 9, there are 31 mat weavers, and each person can weave one mat per day, earning 300 yuan.

Transport and sell local products and medicinal materials
Bring back livestock and furs

Each district has transportation and sales businesses. The fifth district is the most common. This district is located at the junction of mountainous and plain areas. The mountains are poor and the land is barren, and the people's livelihood is difficult. For years, they have relied on transportation and sales to solve their livelihood problems. Now that the liberated areas are connected, farmers not only transport and sell goods in the county, but also go to Yuci, Fenyang, Xiangyuan, Changzhi and other places. Almost all of them bring local cloth, towels, medicinal materials and other groceries, and bring back livestock, furs, sheep, etc. According to statistics from seven villages including Nangang and Jia Township, 210 people transported more than 45,000 catties of local cloth after the autumn harvest this year; ten villages including Nangang, Xiyin, Donghoulan and Xihoulan transported more than 2,580 heads of livestock back throughout the year, and more than 1,600 heads this winter alone. Each head can get a net profit of 500 to 1,000 yuan.

In addition to engaging in sideline production, many villages have paid attention to collecting firewood, accumulating fertilizer, increasing livestock, and planting trees and afforestation to prepare for next year's major production. For example, Daoqi Village in District 9 estimates that the entire village will need 800,000 catties of firewood by the first month of next year (lunar calendar). In addition to the existing 240,000 catties, the shortfall is planned to be made up by collecting 380,000 catties of firewood and buying 180,000 catties of coal. More than 40 people in Yangfan Village in District 5 collected 50,000 catties of firewood in one and a half months. Jia Township and eight other villages in District 5 planted nurseries, planting 7,100 walnut trees and one dou of black dates.

After initial rectification, the county, district, and village cooperatives have also attached importance to organizing and leading mass production and have strengthened their ties with the masses. In order to solve the difficulties of supply and marketing for the masses, the county joint cooperative established a mat shop in District 1 and a fur sales shop in District 5, and ordered 500,000 shoe soles on behalf of women. The District 1 Joint Cooperative paid attention to organizing the masses to weave mats, and the District 5 Joint Cooperative paid attention to organizing the masses to weave textiles, which solved the difficulties of supply and marketing for the masses. The village cooperatives, after rectification, have also attached importance to leading and organizing mass production, and have changed their past purely profit-making and charitable relief views.

Although the county's winter production has achieved considerable results, there are still many shortcomings in the leadership of winter production at all levels, mainly the leadership is tight at the beginning and loose at the end, forming a spontaneous flow of production in the later stage, and the problems have not been resolved. For example, some people still cannot find a way to transport and sell goods, or do not have the capital; some village cadres are satisfied with the phenomenon of the masses actively producing, and do not work hard to lead and improve, only reporting achievements to the higher authorities, not reporting shortcomings; in many villages, the elderly, weak, women, and children have great difficulties in production, no one helps them, and the leaders have not helped them find production avenues; some villages did not immediately turn to production after the end of land reform, which also caused considerable delays. The county has begun to pay attention to these problems and has begun to overcome and correct them in order to lead winter production more effectively. (Xingtai Office)

### 发展手工业组织运销　邢台冬季副业普遍开展  领导上亟应克服自流现象

　　发展手工业组织运销
  　邢台冬季副业普遍开展
    领导上亟应克服自流现象
    【太行讯】邢台县冬季副业生产现已普遍展开。该县自结束土改后，农民生产情绪更加高涨。纷纷进行各种副业生产。其生产门路，一种是手工业（熬硝、纺织、编席、皮毛等）；另一种是运销。
    硝业方面：一、二区为最普遍。一区二十九个村，有三百九十多个硝民。九月至十二月中旬，共出硝六千八百余斤。每斤按五斤小米计，共折米三万四千余斤。二区三十一个村，一百四十六个硝民。九月至十二月中旬，共出硝七千五百余斤，可赚米三万七千余斤。
　　纺车和织机大都动起来
    该县纺织业过去比较落后，抗战以后才逐渐发展。今冬经过普遍号召，不少村庄已开展起来。折户村共有纺妇九十四个，织妇七十七个，在二十天内，纺线三百零七斤，织布二百一十多斤。羊范四百五十张纺车已全部动起来。从九月到十月底，纺毛六千五百多斤，赚新币五万七千元；纺花一千一百多斤，织布二百四十五丈，两宗共赚新币五万四千多元。九区前掌村现有纺纱机十七架，手拉梭机四十一个。手拉梭机每人一天能织斤半，纺纱机每人一天能纺斤四两以上，比旧纺车旧织机多产一倍至两倍。不但数量增加，而且质量也提高了。五区尹贾乡、火石岗等村合作社，为了提高纺织技术，还开办了训练班。全县纺车织机，大都转动起来。
    编席以一、九区为最多，赚钱也不少。如九区稻畦村有三十一个编席手，每人一天能编一张席，可收入三百元。
　　运出土产药材
  　带回牲口皮毛
    运销业各区都有。其中以五区为最多。该区是山地、平原交接地带，山穷地薄，民生困苦，历年来都靠运销来解决生活之不足。现在各解放区联成一片，农民除在本县运销外，还到榆次、汾阳、襄垣、长治等地。差不多都是去时带土布、毛巾、药材等杂货，回来运牲口、皮毛、羊等。据南岗、贾乡等七个村统计，今年秋后二百一十人运出土布四万五千多斤；南岗、西尹、东西候兰等十个村，一年来运回牲口二千五百八十多头，只今冬就运回一千六百多头。每头可得纯利五百至一千元。
    群众除搞副业生产外，不少村庄已注意了打柴、积肥、增加牲口、植树造林，准备明年大生产。如九区稻畦村，计算全村到明年正月（阴历）需八十万斤柴，除现存的二十四万斤外，其缺数计划打柴三十八万斤，买煤十八万斤。五区羊范村四十多人一个半月打柴五万斤。五区贾乡等八村种苗圃，光核桃树即种七千一百棵，黑枣种一斗。
    该县县、区、村合作社，经过初步整顿后，也重视了组织领导群众生产，密切了与群众的联系。县联社为了解决群众供销困难，特在一区成立了席店，在五区成立了皮毛运销店，并给妇女代订鞋底五十万只。一区联社注意了组织群众编席，五区联社注意了组织群众纺织，解决了群众供销困难。经过整顿的村合作社，也已重视了领导组织群众生产，转变了过去单纯营利和恩赐救济观点。
    该县冬季生产虽有相当成绩，但各级对冬季生产领导上仍有不少缺点，主要是领导上前紧后松，形成后段生产自流，问题未得解决。如运销中还有的找不到门路，或没有资本；有的村干满足于群众积极生产的现象，不努力去领导提高，向上只报告成绩，不报告缺点；有许多村庄老弱妇孺生产很困难，没人和她们互助，领导上也未帮助她们找寻生产出路；有些村庄在结束土改以后，没有马上转入生产，也耽误不小。以上这些问题，该县已开始注意，并开始克服纠正，以更有力地领导冬季生产。（邢台办公室）
