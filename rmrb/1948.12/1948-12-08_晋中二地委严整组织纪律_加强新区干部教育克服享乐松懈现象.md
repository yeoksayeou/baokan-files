　　Jinzhong Second Prefectural Committee Strictly Rectifies Organizational Discipline
　　Strengthens Cadre Education in New Areas to Overcome Hedonistic and Lax Tendencies
　　[Jinzhong Electric] The Jinzhong Second Prefectural Committee issued instructions in the first ten days of this month to strengthen the organizational nature and discipline of cadres. The instructions stated: After the liberation of the vast areas of Jinzhong, due to the failure of leaders at all levels to promptly focus on the ideological education of cadres, some cadres developed a mentality of complacency and enjoyment, as well as arrogance, complacency, freedom, laxity, and other phenomena of disorganization and lack of discipline. For example, Liu Ke, a cadre from the Fourth District of Taiyuan County, abandoned his work to wander around Xugou during the busy support-the-front transport of grain. A financial and grain assistant in the First District handed over the official seal of the district office to a chamber of commerce president who had worked for the enemy and puppets and returned home on his own. Guo Wei, a cadre from the Second District of Taiyuan County, embezzled a cart, 100 catties of salt, and eight cloth bags while leading more than ten members of the armed work team in the Second District. Liang Yuwen, a cadre from the Fifth District, illegally obtained a cart the first time, and after the organization discovered it, he was ordered to return it. Later, he obtained another cart at the Dafosi Temple but deceived the organization by saying it was borrowed from a fellow villager. In addition, phenomena such as reporting more than what was taken and randomly taking confiscated property also occurred. District cadres such as Liu Caiyi, Han Jingyi, and Zhang Qiming in Wenshui showed extremely serious family concepts and now do not want to continue their current work and instead want to return home to become village cadres or teachers. In view of the above situation, the Prefectural Committee specifically instructed county and district party committees to vigorously strengthen the organizational nature and discipline of cadres and the on-the-job learning of cadres. Only in this way can cadres be improved, the party be rectified, and work be done well.
　　After receiving these instructions, the counties checked and arranged for cadre learning. They also discovered and dealt with various ideological problems existing among the cadres. After checking the ideology of cadres, Taiyuan County found that the reason for the emergence of a state of indiscipline and anarchy was that most of the cadres were newly transferred, and the work had not yet entered the right track; a small number of cadres wanted to take the opportunity to seize a handful, and the leadership did not focus on organizing learning, conducting ideological education, organizational life was not strict, and the branch of each district office was not established in a timely manner. To this end, the county decided to establish a learning committee to be responsible for leading the county's learning. In order to understand the policy and theoretical level of cadres, a cadre test was held, and a work system of inspection and reporting was established. In order to strengthen the leadership of the organ branch and strictly enforce party life, it was decided to hold a party member meeting once a month and a group meeting once every half month. The content of the meeting mainly focused on checking ideology and carrying out ideological struggle within the party. In addition, discipline was strictly enforced, and comrades who committed serious errors, such as Guo Wei, Liang Yuwen, and Miao Fayuan, were punished accordingly.

　　晋中二地委严整组织纪律
  　加强新区干部教育克服享乐松懈现象
    【晋中电】晋中二地委于本月上旬发出指示，加强干部的组织性与纪律性。指示称：晋中广大地区解放后，由于各级领导未能及时抓紧干部思想教育，致使部分干部产生了太平享乐观念及骄傲自满、自由散漫、工作松懈等无组织无纪律现象，如太原县四区干部刘克在繁忙的支前运粮中，竟丢下工作去徐沟游串。一区财粮助理员将区公所的公章交给一个曾给敌伪办过事的商会会长保管，自己私自回了家。太原县二区干部郭维率武工队员十余名在二区活动时，贪污了车子一辆，盐一百斤，布袋八个。五区区干部梁玉文，第一次非法搞了车子一辆，经组织上发觉后令其交出。后又在大佛寺搞了一辆车子，却欺骗组织说是向老乡借的。此外，以多报少，乱拿缴获资财的现象，亦曾发生。文水刘才义、韩景义、张启明等区干部表现着极严重的家庭观念，现在的工作不想干竟想回家当村干部或教员。根据以上情形，地委特指示县区党委大力加强干部的组织性与纪律性和在职干部学习。如此，才能提高干部，整好党，做好工作。
    各县接此指示后，都检查与布置了干部学习。并发现与处理了干部思想上所存在的各种问题。太原县在检查干部思想后，发现产生无纪律无政府状态的原因，是由于大部干部系新调来的，工作未入正轨；少数干部则想趁机乱抓一把，领导上没抓紧组织学习，进行思想教育，组织生活不严格，各区机关支部没及时建立。为此，该县决定成立学委会，负责领导全县学习。为了解干部政策理论水平，特举行了干部测验，建立了检查与汇报等工作制度。为加强机关支部领导与严格党的生活，特决定每月开党员大会一次，半月开小组会一次。会议内容主要是检查思想，开展党内思想斗争。此外，严肃纪律，对郭维、梁玉文、苗发元等犯了严重错误的同志，分别予以处分。
