How to Run a Good Spare-Time School?
    Shijiazhuang Has Some Experience

[This Newspaper Reported] The spare-time schools organized by the Shijiazhuang Municipal People's Education Center have achieved considerable success in a very short period of time due to correct methods. The school was established on August 12th. Initially, two commercial bookkeeping classes and one political common sense class were opened. Recently, due to some students being employed or transferring schools, the bookkeeping classes have been merged into one. In early September, two more cultural tutoring classes were added. Currently, the school has a total of four classes with 132 students. Among the students, businessmen account for 37%, workers 14%, farmers 9%, cadres 9%, and the unemployed 19%. In terms of age, over 90% are young and middle-aged people. In terms of education level, 61% have a higher elementary education, 20% have a junior high school education, and the remaining 19% have other levels of education. The school has one principal and one director of teaching (concurrently held by cadres of the People's Education Center), and teachers are hired from various institutions and secondary schools. The teaching time is set for three months to graduate, with each class meeting two to three times a week for two hours each time. In terms of curriculum, the bookkeeping class mainly studies bookkeeping, the culture class studies Chinese and arithmetic, and the political class starts with the policies that students urgently need to understand, gradually entering the study of systematic political knowledge. The first two classes graduated at the end of November. During the two months of teaching, the students' morale was generally very good. Although enemy planes were constantly bombing in late August, most of the students were able to persist in attending classes. Some students, even though they traveled more than twenty li to and from school at night, were able to persevere. Twenty students from the bookkeeping class have now joined accounting departments. The following are some experiences and issues that should be paid attention to:

    I. Full preparation should be made before opening the school. In order to understand the citizens' requirements for learning and to determine the teaching guidelines and methods, it is necessary to conduct repeated and in-depth investigations and research, using methods such as general surveys, key surveys, individual consultations, and convening meetings of activists to understand the situation. Wide publicity and mobilization work should be carried out through activists and blackboard newspapers. Because the school was well prepared in advance, as many as 344 people applied for the first enrollment.

    II. Student enrollment must be voluntary. When mobilizing students, individual streets and neighborhoods adopted a supportive attitude and forcibly sent some people to participate in the study, resulting in some people not enrolling after registering or dropping out shortly after enrolling, which affected the morale of other students. Those who were patiently mobilized and voluntarily applied for the exam were generally able to persevere and had good morale.

    III. The curriculum should be simple and practical. When conducting the initial survey, citizens requested to study more than ten courses such as bookkeeping, politics, Chinese, English, physics, and chemistry. However, in reality, only a few classes can be opened based on the current urgent needs of the students and within the available time. Each class should focus on one course, so that the masses feel that it has practical value in order to seek development. As for teaching time, it should be based on the principle of not hindering production, and it is appropriate to conduct it in the evening, two to three times a week.

    IV. Attention should be paid to organizing extracurricular self-study. Spare-time schools are different from formal schools. If only a few hours of classroom teaching per week are relied upon without more extracurricular self-study, the learning task will be difficult to complete. Therefore, a teaching policy of extracurricular self-study guidance should be adopted. In addition to classroom teaching, teachers should pay attention to checking and helping students with extracurricular previewing and reviewing.

    V. A formal system should be established. In the early days of the school's establishment, the order was quite chaotic, and some students were absent from class or dropped out without reason. Since the establishment of a system of roll call, leave of absence, examination, rewards and punishments, and a relatively simple student self-government organization, the school has gradually become more standardized.

    VI. Political and ideological education should be paid attention to in cultural and technical classes. Students in spare-time schools come from various social occupations and strata. Some people have been deceived and anesthetized by the Japanese invaders and Chiang Kai-shek bandits for a long time, and their thinking is quite complicated. Efforts should be made to use pre-class talks, family visits, and inter-class games (chess, storytelling, etc.) to get as close to them as possible in life, in order to achieve mutual understanding and help improve their political awareness.

    怎样办好业余学校？
    石家庄有了一些经验
    【本报讯】石市民教馆所举办的业余补习学校，由于办法正确，在很短时间内，已取得相当成绩。该校成立于八月十二日。最初开办两个商业簿记班，一个政治常识班。最近因部分学员就业或转学，簿记班已合并为一个。九月初，又添设了两个文化补习班，现全校共四个班，学员一百三十二人。学员中商人占百分之三十七，工人占百分之十四，农民百分之九，干部百分之九，无职业者占百分之十九。按年龄说，百分之九十以上都为青壮年。文化程度方面，高小程度占百分之六十一，初中程度占百分之二十，其他占百分之十九。学校设校长教导主任各一人（由民教馆干部兼任），教员则向各机关及中等学校中聘请。教学时间规定三个月毕业，每班每周上课二次至三次，每次二小时。课程内容簿记班主要学簿记学，文化班学国文、算术二科，政治班从学员所急需了解的政策学起，逐渐进入系统的政治知识之学习。现第一期两个班，于十一月底毕业。两个多月来的教学过程中，学员情绪一般都很好，八月下旬虽在敌机不断轰炸的情况下，大部分学员仍能坚持上课，有的学员虽晚上往返二十余里，也能坚持到校。簿记班现在已有二十人参加了会计部门工作。下面是几点经验及应注意的问题：
    一、开办之前，应作充分的准备工作。为了了解市民对学习的要求以决定教学的方针及方法，必须进行反复深入的调查研究，用普遍调查、重点调查、个别征求意见及召开积极分子会等方式以了解情况，并通过积极分子及黑板报进行广泛的宣传动员工作，该校因为事先准备充分，第一期招生时，报名投考者即达三百四十四人。
    二、学员入学必须出于自愿。该校在发动学员时，个别街、闾采取支应态度，硬派了一些人来参加学习，结果有的报名不入校，或入学不久即辍学，影响了其他学员情绪。而经过耐心动员自动投考的，一般都能坚持下去，情绪也很好。
    三、学习课程要简单而切合实际，开始进行调查时，市民要求学习的课程有簿记、政治、国文、英文、理化等十余种，但实际上，只能根据学员当前的迫切需要及时间许可的范围内，先办几个班，每班以一种课程为主，使群众感到有实际效用，才能求得发展。至于教学时间，以不妨碍生产为原则，以晚上进行，每周二至三次为适宜。
    四、应注意组织课外自学。业余学校不同于正式学校，如仅靠每周几小时的课堂教学，而没有更多的课外自习，则学习任务很难完成。因此应采取课外自学指导的教学方针，教员除在课堂教学之外，应注意检查及帮助学员课外的预习和复习。
    五、应建立正规的制度。该校建立初期，秩序相当紊乱，某些学生随便矿课或无故退学。自建立了点名、请假、考试、奖惩等制度及比较简单的学生自治组织以后，学校才逐步走上正规。
    六、文化技术性质的班次，应注意政治思想教育。业余学校的学生，来自各种社会职业和各种阶层，有些人员受过日寇、蒋匪长期的欺骗麻醉的，思想相当复杂，应设法利用课前谈话、家庭访问、课间游戏（下棋、讲故事等）等方式，在生活上尽最接近他们，以达到相互了解而帮助提高他们的政治认识。（参之）
