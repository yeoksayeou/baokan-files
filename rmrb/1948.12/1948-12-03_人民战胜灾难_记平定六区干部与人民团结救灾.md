　　People Overcome Disaster
    ——A Record of Cadres and People in the Sixth District of Pingding Uniting to Provide Disaster Relief

    In early November, I traveled west along the Jingxing to Pingding highway. This highway was built during the rule of Japanese imperialism. Mentioning this highway, the masses along the way almost all say the same thing: "Countless people died, countless beatings were endured, and countless tears were shed." Everyone naturally compared the days of the Japanese and puppet troops, the Yan bandit troops, with the days of the Communist Party's leadership for over a year: "Now we can finally live a decent life. No matter what, we have a head start now. When I think of the past, I don't know how I survived to this day!" Most of the villages along the highway had undergone eight years of Japanese occupation. Although the Yan bandit troops only occupied them for more than half a year, they turned some villages into no-man's-lands. In those long, suffering days, countless people died and fled. Those who have survived to this day truly don't know how much suffering they have endured! … I seemed to understand the reasoning of the masses, but at the same time, I thought: even now their clothes are still very tattered, women and children run around in the cold wind without cotton clothes, some carry coal loads of fifty to seventy pounds on this wide highway... How can they survive such days? Why are they so energetic in production and without signs of sorrow and pessimism despite such difficulties? On the way west, I kept searching for the answer to this question.
    After arriving at Xijiao Village in the western suburbs of Pingding, I met Comrade Zhang Shouyi, the secretary of the Pingding Sixth District Branch Committee. He briefly introduced the local situation: "There is little land and many people. The entire Sixth District averages only six fen of land per person, and even villages with more land can only average two mu per person. The enemy (including the Japanese and the Yan bandits) greatly damaged the people's economic lives. First, there is the threat of unemployment: after the Japanese invasion, many dyers working outside lost their jobs, and private coal and iron businesses closed down. Second, there is looting. In this regard, the Yan bandits were no less than the Japanese. The people's years of accumulation of agricultural products and tools were looted clean. Third, there are the disasters that came with the destruction. For two consecutive autumns, there was no harvest. The autumn before last, when the Yan bandits attacked, they drove people away, and the crops that were about to be harvested were not eaten. Last year, the drought was one aspect. On the other hand, there was no harvest the year before last, and the land was not turned over, so it could not be planted well, so it was as if there was no harvest. Only this year was there a half harvest." Because of these reasons, he affirmed: "The difficulties have not been overcome. The spring famine next year must be addressed and resolved by the leadership as soon as possible." Speaking of this, he changed his tone again. He said: "The good morale of the masses is a basic condition for overcoming difficulties. Take the fight against Taiyuan this time. Some people know that the grain at home may not last through the winter, but the morale of the laborers participating in the war is very good. Men go to the front, and women dig the ground at home. Historically, women in Pingding did not have the habit of working in the fields, but now that has changed. However, the morale is relatively poor in villages where we do not work deeply enough, and the situation is not very balanced." After we, the six or seven people traveling with us, conducted some simple investigations among the village cadres and various strata in Xijiao Village, Comrade Zhang Shouyi's words were quickly confirmed. The enthusiasm of the masses to not fear difficulties and to overcome them was beyond imagination. The facts we investigated are as follows: Xijiao Village has a total of 528 households with more than 2,000 people. Before the Japanese occupation, there were more than 100 dyers working outside, but now most of them are unemployed. The entire village has a total of 4,600 mu of land, and this year each mu can yield an average of five dou (sixteen jin per dou) of coarse grains (normally one shi can be produced). There was no harvest for two consecutive years. During the Yan bandit rule, the masses all fled for a total of eight months (from last autumn to this spring). When they returned in March this year, pots, basins, bowls, spoons, needles, hoes, sickles, axes... were all gone. No family had any savings. This spring, many people ate leaves, bark, and grass... As soon as the corn turned yellow in the autumn, they had to fetch it to eat. But although life was so difficult, no one has starved to death in the past year. Among the two poor peasant households, four new middle peasant households, and two middle peasant households we personally visited, two households had enough grain to last until the wheat harvest, five households could barely survive the winter, and one household could not survive the winter. But the standard of living for some is calculated on the following scale: Jin Fukui, a poor peasant who had just turned over, had a family of six who ate five jin of miscellaneous grains every day. They could eat two or three jin of salt a month, but they couldn't even talk about oil. If they wanted to eat white flour for the New Year, they would have to rely entirely on "pu nao" (meaning to find various ways to produce), and there was none at home. Generally, the whole village only has enough grain to last through the winter, and only a few can last until the wheat harvest. During the visits, we worried about them and asked them: Is the public grain a bit heavy? How do you live? They replied with confidence: "We can't live even more if we don't defeat Yan Xishan. We can't defeat Yan Xishan without paying public grain." "It seems difficult today, but it is not as difficult as in the past. We survived two years of no harvest, and we managed to harvest something this year, so we are even less afraid."
    Although this area has only been liberated for a little over a year, and the democratic government and the local people have only established a real connection for three years (after the Japanese surrender, a democratic regime was established here to implement rent and interest reduction; after the Yan bandit invasion, most of it became a guerrilla zone), the people can now completely trust it. Under the leadership of correct policies, this connection is permanently consolidated and cannot be severed.
    The people are satisfied with our party's thorough land reform policy to eliminate feudalism. A most common opinion is: "In the past, we worked hard for a year, and most of it went to the landlord. Now, we work hard for a year, and it all goes to ourselves." "Who says the public grain is heavy? They have no conscience. Wasn't the rent we paid in the past much heavier than this?"
    The people are satisfied with the government's policy of providing timely loans and leading production: "For two years, we couldn't have lived without the government's help. In the autumn of 1946, when the Yan bandit troops came, they snatched the millet we were about to eat, and they took everything they could want, including clothes, bedding, farm tools, and supplies. The democratic government led the masses to evacuate and lent us 40,000 jin of public grain and 90,000 yuan in textile loans. Men and women worked together to produce. In addition, cadres led the militia to protect the masses and also came back to grab some grain. We survived eight months of displacement in this way. When we returned in March 1947, we didn't plant the land until April. Farm tools, seeds, and food were all lent by the government. Of course, there are many people, and the government can't support us every day, so it has to lead the masses to get up and work, and plan all day long what to use to exchange for rice to eat. Men carried pots, women carried charcoal, and everyone was mobilized! Relying on government loans, we also organized coal stations and small cooperatives for spinning, transporting... We did all kinds of work. Although there was no harvest last autumn, we plowed the land. This spring, the government helped us with loans and organized production again, and we managed to plant the land. Although we ate bark and wild vegetables, we managed to get through it. It is impossible without the help and leadership of the democratic government." This is what the village chief of Xijiao Village told the reporter. He repeatedly emphasized the importance of "leadership." He has been the village chief for three years, and this is entirely his own personal experience.
    Are there things that the people are not satisfied with? Yes, there are. For example, they are not very satisfied with the fact that loans are collected at the same time as public grain is collected, and they feel that it is too rushed. However, they truly believe that they will be lent to them again after they are collected. They are also not very satisfied with elementary school teachers who are too uneducated, and they feel that they can't afford to support them with white millet, and some even simply ask them to leave by not paying millet... All of these cannot change their enthusiastic trust in the Communist Party and the democratic government; because the people's confidence has been deeply rooted in their personal struggle experience.

　　人民战胜灾难
    ——记平定六区干部与人民团结救灾
    丁＠
    记者于十一月初，沿井陉至平定公路西行。这条公路是日本帝国主义统治时所修，提起这条公路来，沿途的群众几乎都是一个说法：“数不清死了多少人，数不见挨过多少打，更说不清流过多少眼泪。”大家都很自然地以日伪军、阎匪军与一年多来共产党领导的日子做对比：“如今可算过的来了，不管怎么说，而今有了个熬头，想起过去就不知道还能活到今天！”沿公路的村庄，大多经过日寇的八年统治，阎匪军虽只占了多半年，但却把一些村庄弄成了无人区。在那长期的苦难的日子里，死了的，逃走了的，数不清了。活到今天的人，真不知受过多少罪啊！……我好象懂得了群众所说的道理，但却同时又想到：至今他们的衣服还穿得十分破烂，妇女小孩们不穿棉衣在冷风中跑来跑去，有的挑着五十斤至七十斤的煤担在这条宽大的公路上奔走……这样的日子如何过得下去呢？这样的困难，他们为什么生产的那么有劲，而没愁苦悲观的现象呢？西行途中，我不断在寻找着这个问题的解答。
    到平定西郊村后，遇到了平定六区的分委书记张守益同志，他概略地介绍了当地的情况：“地少人多，全六区每人只平均六分地，土地较多的村每人也只能平均到二亩。敌人（包括日寇与阎匪）对人民经济生活的破坏极大。第一是失业的威胁：从日寇侵入后，许多在外的染工失业，私营的煤铁业关门。第二是抢掠，在这一点上阎匪并不比日寇逊色，人民多年的农物农具积蓄，被抢掠净尽。第三是随着破坏而来的灾荒，连着两个秋天没收秋，前年秋阎匪进攻，把人赶跑了，眼看到嘴的庄稼没吃上。去年天旱是一方面，另方面前年没收秋，地没翻也种不好，因此等于没收。今年才算收了个半秋。”由于这些原因，他肯定地说：“困难并未渡过，明年的春荒还必须领导上及早注意与设法解决。”说到这里，他把语气又转过来了。他说：“群众情绪好，就是战胜困难的一个基本条件。就以这次打太原来说，有的人明知道，家里的粮食还可能过不了冬，但参战民工的情绪却非常好。男人上前线，妇女就在家刨地，历史上平定的妇女是没有上地劳动习惯，但现在却改变了。不过我们工作得不深入的村庄，情绪就比较差，情况是不很平衡的。”当我们同行的六、七人在西郊村向村干部、各阶层做了一些简单的调查之后，张守益同志的话很快地被证实了，群众不怕困难与战胜困难的热情是出乎想象的，我们调查到的有如下的事实：西郊村共五百二十八户两千多口人，日寇未占领前有出外染工一百多，现在则大部失业了。全村共土地四千六百亩，今年每亩平均可收五斗（十六斤斗）粗粮（平年可产一石）。连着两年没收秋。阎匪统治时群众全部逃出共八个月（从去秋至今春），今年三月回来时，锅、盆、碗、勺、针、ｊｕé＠②、镰、斧……一样都没有了，没有一家人有积蓄。今年春天吃树叶、树皮、草……的人不少。秋天玉茭刚黄就不得不弄来吃。但日子虽然过得如此困难，一年来却没有饿死过人。在我们所亲访的两户贫农四户新中农两户中农中，粮食可吃到麦夏的有两户，刚能过冬的有五户，不能过冬的有一户。但生活水平有些是以以下的尺度做计算的：新翻身的贫农晋福魁，一家六口每日吃五斤杂粮，盐每月能吃二斤或三斤，油则根本谈不到，过年如果想吃白面，就得全凭“扑闹”（按即找各种门路生产），家里是一点点也没的。全村一般粮食只能过冬天，能过麦夏的是少数。访问中我们替他们发愁，问他们：公粮是否有些重？你们的日子如何过？他们充满信心的回答：“不打败阎锡山更不能活，不交公粮就打不败阎锡山。”“看今天好象困难，比过去则不困难，两年没收秋都过来了，今年好歹收了些，更不怕了。”
    虽然这块地方才只解放了一年多，民主政府与当地人民建立真正的连系还只三年光景（日寇投降后此地建立民主政权实行减租减息，阎匪侵占后，大部变为游击区），但人民已能完全信赖它，在正确政策领导下，这种连系是永久巩固的，与不可割断的。
    人民对于我党的彻底消灭封建的土地改革政策是满意的。一个最普遍的舆论是：“过去辛苦一年，多半归了地主，而今辛苦一年，全数归了自己。”“谁说公粮重，那是没良心。过去交租米不比这重得多？”
    人民对于政府及时发放贷款与领导生产的政策是满意的：“两年了，没有政府的帮助就不能活，三十五年秋天，阎匪军来了，眼看吃到嘴里的谷子被抢了去，衣服被褥、农具用品没有他不要的。民主政府领导群众转移出去，借给四万斤公粮，又贷给九万元纺织贷款，男女一齐动手生产。此外，干部带领民兵掩护群众也回来抢收了些粮食。八个月的流亡日子就这样过来了。三十六年三月回来，四月才种地，农具、种子、吃的粮食都是政府贷的。当然，人多啦，政府不能天天养活，还得领导群众起来干，整天打算用什么办法换米吃，男人担锅，女人担炭，全都动员起来啦！依靠政府的贷款，我们还组织了煤站，组织了小型合作社纺花、运输…………啥活也干。去年秋天虽没收成，但却把地耕完了。今年春天又是政府帮助贷款与组织生产，算把地种上了。虽说树皮、野菜都吃了，但总算过来了。没有民主政府帮助和领导是不行的。”这是西郊村长对记者的谈话，他再三强调“领导”的重要，他担任村长已三年了，这完全是他自己的切身体验。
    人民有没有不满意的事情呢？有的。比如对于在收公粮时同时又收回贷款这件事，就不大满意，觉得赶得太紧了些。不过他们确乎相信，收回去还会贷给他们的。对于文化太低的小学教员也不大满意，觉得白出小米养活不起，有的甚至索性以不出米的办法，请他离开…………。所有这些都不能改变他们对共产党与民主政府信赖的热情；因为人民的信心，已从切身斗争体验中根深蒂固了。
