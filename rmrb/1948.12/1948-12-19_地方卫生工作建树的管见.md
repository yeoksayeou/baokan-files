Some Personal Views on Building Local Health Work
Deputy Minister of Health, North China People's Government, Liu Heyi

The medical and health work in the vast rural areas of our North China Liberated Area is a problem that the masses urgently demand to be solved. There is no mature experience in how to build this work in various places. Here are some personal views for discussion:

I. Local Hygiene and Medical Work:

Because the broad masses still lack certain health knowledge and habits, diseases have spread widely for many years and caused great harm. Many diseases, such as malaria, smallpox, dysentery, etc., can be prevented in advance; and the main method of prevention lies in paying attention to hygiene. The specific work of local hygiene should vary from time to time and from place to place. Due to limited conditions, the general principle should be to implement methods that are easy to implement and easy for the masses to accept. For example, planting cowpox in spring to prevent smallpox, advocating mosquito eradication in summer, not drinking raw water, advocating mosquito eradication and fumigation in summer and autumn to prevent malaria, advocating covering the mouth and nose with a handkerchief when going out in winter to prevent severe cold and transmission of smallpox, pneumonia, etc.; usually advocating cleaning, opening windows to sun bedding, washing clothes and bodies, etc.

The leading organization of local hygiene work should not rely solely on health administrative organs, but should mobilize the masses to consciously handle it. Local health administrators are responsible for guidance and assistance. Health committees should be established in districts and villages to be responsible for assisting in leadership. Village primary school teachers should assist in handling and publicizing education to the masses, or use the "little teacher" system to carry out publicity at home. District and village women cadres should regularly carry out publicity on maternal and child health.

The establishment of local medical work includes widely establishing health cooperatives (or medical cooperatives), establishing public hospitals (hospitals of all levels of government), and organizing medical and epidemic prevention teams. Health cooperatives should be funded and shareholding by the masses, and the public should provide assistance, such as loans, guidance, and introduction of technical personnel. Shareholders should be given preferential treatment, and general public fees should also be low. The number of establishments should be large, and the location should be appropriate to meet the needs of the masses. Public hospitals should belong to the government. Governments above the county level should organize a hospital as the technical center of medical work in a county. Doctors with better technology should be hired to solve problems such as surgery, delivery, and diagnosis and treatment of serious illnesses. If conditions and development are better, branch hospitals or clinics can be established. If conditions are limited, another method can be adopted, that is, the public allocates a part of the fund, and then the local area raises shares, and organizes local advanced people or medical technicians to manage the business, which is called a cooperative hospital. In addition, health authorities at all levels should organize medical and epidemic prevention teams and health publicity and education, so that the masses can receive medical treatment when they are sick, and prevent the occurrence or transmission of diseases even when they are not sick.

II. Organization and Training of Local Health Personnel

According to informal statistics, there are more than 5,000 local private practitioners of Chinese and Western medicine, and scattered county doctors. Due to the lack of overall organization, they have not been able to make the best use of their talents. We should unite and strive for those with rich experience and high skills, and select them to appropriate positions so that they can serve the masses; those with poor knowledge and skills must also be centrally trained to improve their skills.

The training of doctors should not be limited to traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine, and the principle should be to enable them to understand modern medical knowledge. In particular, traditional Chinese medicine should be increased with modern new medical techniques and theoretical research, so that it can better serve the society.

In addition to traditional Chinese and Western medicine doctors, the organization and training of local health personnel should also train district health assistants and village health workers. Primary school teachers and comrades working in districts and villages are appropriate. These personnel should be transferred for training, taught health knowledge, and rural hygiene and infectious disease management, simple first aid, acupuncture, and life statistics, so that health work can be easily carried out. This type of personnel is a part of the local health work force and should be vigorously organized. However, the implementation of this work should be based on the principle of not hindering their own work. The government may give appropriate commendation and rewards according to their achievements.

In addition to schools of midwifery for women and infants, attention should also be paid to training midwives to transform old midwives. Women working comrades and old middle-aged midwives in counties, districts, or villages should be selected for short-term training to teach scientific delivery techniques, correct or ban unhygienic old methods. The county health institutes and municipal or special district health sections are responsible for the training; or the administrative office health bureau and the people's government health department are requested to send personnel to assist. The training of doctors of traditional Chinese and Western medicine, midwives, and district health assistants should be the responsibility of the health bureau or the health department.

III. Organization of Local Health Administrative Agencies

In addition to establishing certain health administrative agencies at all levels of government to uniformly handle and lead the above-mentioned health work, in order to carry out this work more universally and in a more planned way, a health committee organization should be established at all levels of leadership to pool wisdom and guide and assist health agencies at all levels, while carrying out some social relief work. As for the selection of personnel, in addition to the participation of persons in charge of various departments of governments at all levels, well-respected medical experts, health chiefs of the armed forces, and enlightened people in society should also be invited to form the committee. In addition, various health departments should cooperate with education departments to jointly organize a health education committee to carry out school health and health publicity and education matters. Discuss with the women's committees at all levels to organize a maternal and child health committee to assist in carrying out maternal and child health publicity and education work. Negotiate with state-owned enterprise departments to jointly organize a health committee to carry out factory hygiene work to protect workers' health.

In short, the establishment of this work in various places is still far from adequate. Leaders at all levels should give sufficient attention to it, improve health institutions, train health personnel at all levels, unite and transform doctors of traditional Chinese and Western medicine and midwives, establish health cooperatives, etc., so that local health work can be better established and developed, gradually transform people's health habits, reduce people's pain from diseases, improve rural cultural and health life, and promote the construction of a new democratic new country.

　　地方卫生工作建树的管见
    华北人民政府卫生部副部长  刘和一
    我华北解放区广大农村的医疗卫生工作，是当前群众迫切要求解决的问题，这一工作究应如何建树，各地还没有较成熟的经验，兹就管见所及，提供各方研究：
    一、地方卫生与医疗工作：
    由于广大群众现尚缺乏一定的卫生知识与习惯，历年来疾病蔓延为害甚大。而不少疾病如疟疾、天花、赤痢等，均可事先防免；而防免之法，主要在讲求卫生。关于地方卫生的具体工作，应因时因地有所不同，因条件限制，一般应以施行容易，便于群众接受为原则。如春天种牛痘以防天花，夏季提倡灭蝇，不喝生水，夏秋之交提倡灭蚊熏舍，以防疟疾，冬季提倡出外以手巾罩口鼻，以防严寒与传染天花、肺炎等；平时提倡打扫清洁，开窗晒被，洗衣洗身等。
    地方卫生工作的领导机构，不应专赖卫生行政机关，而应发动群众自觉办理。地方之卫生行政人员，负指导与帮助之责。区村设卫生委员会，负责帮助领导。村小学教员应协助办理并向群众宣传教育，或以小先生制，回家进行宣传。区村妇女干部，应经常进行妇婴卫生的宣传。
    地方医疗工作之建树，一为广泛成立卫生合作社（或医药合作社），一为开办公立医院（各级政府医院），并组织医疗防疫队。卫生合作社应由群众筹资集股，公家予以协助，如贷款、指导、介绍技术人员等，股东应受优待，一般群众收费亦应低廉，建立数目宜多，地点应适中，以适应群众之需要。公立医院应属政府，县以上政府，均应组织一个医院，为一县医疗工作的技术中心，应聘请技术较好的医生，要能解决手术、接产、及重病诊治等问题。如条件及开展较好时，可设分院或诊疗所。如因条件所限，可采另一办法，即公家拨予一部基金，再由地方集股，组织地方先进人士或医务技术较优者管理业务，名为合作医院。此外各级卫生机关应组织医疗防疫队及卫生宣传教育等事项，做到使群众有病得医，无病也先防御疾病的发生或传染。
    二、地方卫生人员的组织与训练
    我区地方开业的中西医生，和零星县壶治病的先生，据非正式的统计，约在五千以上，因缺乏总的组织，致未能人尽其才，才尽其用。其具有丰富经验与高明技术者，我们应团结争取，并选拔至适当的工作岗位，使其能为群众服务；其学识技术较差者，亦须集中训练，提高其技术。
    训练医生，当不限中医西医，均以使能了解现代医学常识为原则。尤以中医更应增加其现代新医术及理论探讨，使能更好服务社会。
    地方卫生人员的组织与训练，除中西医生外，尚应训练区卫生助理员与村卫生员。以小学教员及区村工作的同志为宜，应将这些人员抽调训练，教以卫生常识，及乡村卫生与传染病管理、简单急救、针炙术及生命统计等，使卫生工作便于开展。此种人员为地方卫生工作之一部力量，应予大力组织。但此工作之执行，以不妨碍其本身工作为原则，政府得按其进行的成绩予以适当的表扬与奖励。
    比外应注意训练助产士改造旧产婆，除妇婴卫生学校外，还应挑选县、区或村的妇女工作同志及旧的中年产婆，予以短期训练，教以科学的接产术，纠正或取缔不卫生的老办法。由县卫生院及市或专署卫生科负责训练；或请行署卫生局及人民政府卫生部派员协助。而中西医生、助产士及区卫生助理员等的训练，应由卫生局或卫生部负责。
    三、地方卫生行政机构之组织
    各级政府除设一定的卫生行政机构，统一办理领导上述诸项卫生工作外，为了更普遍与有计划的开展此项工作，各级领导上，应成立一健康委员会的组织，以期集思广益，指导与协助各级卫生机关。同时进行社会某种救济工作。至于人选问题，除应由各级政府中各部门负责人参加外，还应聘请有威望的医术专家、部队的卫生首长、及社会开明人士等组成。此外各卫生部门，应协同教育部门，共同组织健康教育委员会，以便进行学校卫生及卫生宣传教育事项。与各级妇委商讨，组织妇婴健康委员会，以期协助进行妇婴卫生宣传教育工作。与公营企业部门协商共同组织健康委员会，进行工厂卫生工作，保护工友健康。
    总之，此项工作各地建树都还很不够、各级领导上应予足够重视，健全卫生机构，培养训练各级卫生人员，团结改造中西医生的产婆，创办卫生合作社等，以便地方卫生工作更好的建立与开展，逐渐改造人民的卫生习惯，减少人民疾病痛苦，提高农村文化卫生生活，推进新民主主义新国家的建设。
