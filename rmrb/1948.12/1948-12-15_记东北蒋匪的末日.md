    Record of the Last Days of the Chiang Kai-shek Bandits in the Northeast
    Hua Shan
    In the last battle in the Northeast, Chiang Kai-shek frantically shuttled between Beiping (Peiping) and Shenyang, flying to Shenyang three times to "supervise the battle." How did Chiang's foolish and desperate struggles end in a shameful defeat, and how chaotic and embarrassing was the collapse of the Kuomintang bandit army? The reporter learned about these scenes from Song Ziying, the lieutenant general and deputy chief of staff of the Kuomintang Northeast "Bandit Suppression Headquarters" who laid down his arms, and Yang Kun, the chief of staff of the Liao Yaoxiang Corps, and others. During Chiang Kai-shek's last flight to Shenyang to supervise the battle, he once roared at a hastily convened military meeting: "Do as I say, and I will be responsible for the failure!" At that time, he said he wanted to personally save his beloved American-equipped main force, the Liao Yaoxiang Corps. But what was the result? He even lost Shenyang.
    According to Song Ziying: "In early October, Chiang Kai-shek brought the defeated general Du Yuming to Shenyang. Several of us deputy chiefs of staff privately discussed: 'I wonder whose turn it is to be unlucky this time.'" At that time, Chiang roared again and again: "I am here to save the Northeast," and insisted on concentrating all forces to "fight a Jinzhou battle to reverse the situation in the Northeast." The bandit Wei Lihuang believed that "instead of risking a westward advance with the main force, it would be better to take advantage of the enemy's rear emptiness and first respond to the Nationalist army in Changchun to return to Shenyang." But the bandit Du shamelessly said: "If we defeat Lin Biao's main force, why worry about Changchun!" Despite the bandit Wei's lament that "I can't do this commander-in-chief," Chiang ordered Liao Yaoxiang to form a "Westward Attack Corps" and sent the bandit Du to Huludao to establish an "Eastward Corps Command Post." At the next day's meeting, Chiang announced again that "Chief Du will stay here to help unconditionally," kicking the figurehead commander-in-chief Wei aside. The Chiang family's confidant general Liao Yaoxiang, who had been extensively trained by Italian Fascists and American imperialists, had always disregarded the bandit Wei, and now that Chiang was personally in command, his arrogance was beyond words. He pointed his main force towards Zhangwu in the north, attempting to "cut off the Communist army's strategic supply line and the main force's southward passage," and then advance south to reinforce Jinzhou.
    At this time, the American news agency boasted that Liao had "achieved a decisive victory." However, at this moment, the People's Liberation Army captured Jinzhou in one fell swoop with an astonishing speed of thirty-one hours, shattering Chiang Kai-shek's entire "decisive battle" plan and throwing the Northeast Chiang bandits into a desperate situation with no way to retreat. Anxious, Chiang flew to Shenyang for the second time that day (October 17), telegraphed Liao to "continue westward regardless of the situation in Jinzhou." At the same time, he threatened the isolated army in Changchun with a handwritten order: if they did not "break through immediately," they would be "punished for disobeying orders and subject to severe military discipline." According to Yang Kun, the captured chief of staff of the Liao Corps: After Chiang flew back to Beiping, he used a radio telephone to urge Liao: "Advance rapidly not with the intention of relieving Jinzhou, but with the intention of recovering Jinzhou," and "use the determination to seek life from death to attack Jinzhou from both sides." However, Liao, whose heart and膽膽胆were broken by the prestige of the People's Liberation Army, now regarded Chiang's orders as "death warrants." Liao's corps was still hovering north of Xinlitun until the 19th. And the news came from Changchun that the 60th Army had revolted and Zheng Dongguo led his troops to surrender.
    Chiang ate two big blows in a row and realized that the situation was not good. He flew to Shenyang for the third time on October 25. This time, Chiang Kai-shek, feeling the approach of death, had become so panic-stricken and suspicious that he dared not even enter the city of Shenyang, where his confidant Wei Lihuang had been stationed for more than twenty years. He summoned the bandit Wei to the airport and held a hasty one-hour emergency meeting in the plane to discuss the so-called "final decision." At that time, Chiang estimated that the People's Liberation Army would advance south to attack Jinxi and Shanhaiguan, and he so fatuously believed that after the Jinzhou battle, the People's Liberation Army troops "could not conduct a major battle within half a month, which is a good opportunity for a north-south pincer attack." The bandit Du also encouraged him from the side, saying: "If we fight well, we can inflict a heavy blow on the enemy, or at least preserve the main force to enter the pass." Wei looked embarrassed at this time, but Chiang roared: "I will take full responsibility, you don't have to worry about anything!" Chiang also ordered Liao to personally go to the front line to command, "continue westward day and night according to the original plan." As soon as the meeting of the bandit leaders was over, Chiang hurriedly flew back to Beiping in the setting sun, waiting for the "good news" from western Liaoning during a sleepless night.
    However, from the 23rd, the entire Liao Corps was blocked north of Heishan by a division of the People's Liberation Army. Liao deployed all its main force of twelve American-equipped divisions on a front 25 miles wide, and under the cover of aircraft and artillery, launched fierce attacks on the Heishan position in turn with the most elite seven divisions, vainly attempting to open the road to the west, but failed to gain an inch after two days and nights of attack. According to Yang Kun: At that time, Liao felt that something was not right. Then, on the night of the 25th, he discovered that our main force attacking Jinzhou had already appeared on the battlefield, and he panicked immediately, and the "determination to advance westward completely wavered." At this time, the bandit Wei, sitting in the empty city of Shenyang, hurriedly sent a telegram to Liao saying: "There is no enemy situation in the Liao River yet. Take advantage of the fact that there is no major contact in the north to quickly get out of the battlefield and return to Shenyang." However, Liao was afraid of repeating the desperate situation in Changchun. He did not retreat to Shenyang, but ordered the armies overnight to "change the front from east to west to a front from north to south, and immediately move to Yingkou." For a time, the morale of the army was shaken, and they all flocked to Taian. This "escorted" army of 100,000 people had just run to the edge of the Rao River when they were intercepted by the People's Liberation Army that had suddenly come from the north. Liao urgently attacked with four divisions to seize the road, but made no progress after a day of fighting. According to Yang Kun: On the night of the 25th, a "retreat" had already thrown the Liao Corps into chaos. The twelve divisions were squeezed on a fifty-mile plain full of swamps. Just as they were worried about how to reorganize the troops, they suddenly received a radio telephone call from Wei Lihuang from Shenyang: "The 'Chongqing' warship, which was scouting the waterway to Yingkou, is stranded 28 nautical miles from the port, and the 52nd Army is crowded in Yingkou and cannot board the ship." Liao, who had no way out, wavered in his determination to go south. He ordered the various units to "immediately turn back to Xinmin in the north in situ." Li Tao, the commander of the New 6th Army, and Luo Ying, the commander of the New 22nd Division, complained: "If we retreat again, we will not be able to control the troops." While they were still hesitating, the entire Liao Corps was surrounded by the People's Liberation Army that poured in from all directions. Liao's corps headquarters was also overturned by the People's Liberation Army that had penetrated into the heart of the army. This was in the morning of the 26th. At this time, Wei Lihuang, who was guarding the radio telephone in Shenyang, contacted everywhere but could not find Liao and their four army headquarters, and was as anxious as an ant on a hot pot. Suddenly, he received a telegram from Chiang Kai-shek ordering him to "quickly order Liao's troops to return to Shenyang." Wei threw the telegram on the table and said: "Why didn't we withdraw earlier? Now everything is stuck, how can we withdraw!" After finally waiting until dusk, he received a call from the New 22nd Division from Liao, and immediately instructed the direction of the breakout: "There is no major enemy situation in the Liao River in the north." Liao had just said "it's still okay" when the telephone connection was interrupted again, and since then "the situation is unknown."
    Liang Tiebao, the commander of the Provisional 59th Division of the New 3rd Army, recalled the chaos at the time: "It was a completely confused battle. I didn't even know how I was defeated when I was captured." In just one day on the 26th, he received five different orders, sometimes ordering him to "retreat 30 miles to hold firm," sometimes ordering him to "attack eastward across the river," and sometimes "immediately abandon the enemy and move south." He finally got rid of the pursuers and was about to assemble the troops when he was called to "break through" to the south, dragging the troops down to only three battalions. It was already late at night. His troops were running south when they were met by the main force of the corps. The fields were full of cars, trucks, artillery vehicles, and horses. It was impossible to tell which army or division was which. All that could be heard was a cry of "break through to the north." Liang Tiebao didn't bother to inquire about the situation and turned around and ran. Unexpectedly, the People's Liberation Army suddenly came down from the north and blocked the entire Liao Bandit Corps in the pocket of the People's Liberation Army.
    On the morning of the 27th, the "ace army" struggled in the swamps of the Rao River and the Liu River, covered in mud. American cars and weapons were thrown on the river bank. Heavy artillery tractors were lying on the side of the road. Howitzers stretched their necks in the rapids. Jeeps with the "Tiger Might" and "Eagle Yang" badges, which had rampaged on this land two years ago, were now submerged in the dark mud, with only the seats full of sewage exposed. Liao Yaoxiang, the glorified Chiang family confidant general, and his chief of staff Yang Kun, and army commander Li Tao ran on the sorghum stubble. A group of veterans they had personally trained was running past them, but no one paid attention no matter how they shouted. Liao could only send the two major generals around him to be vanguards. However, after a burst of gunfire came from ahead, the two "vanguards" disappeared.
    The annihilation of the Liao Corps, like a shocking wave, suddenly crashed into the broken ship of the Chiang Wei bandit gang. The Northeast "Bandit Suppression Headquarters" bandits could only use plane tickets as "life-saving charms." From the 26th, more than a dozen transport planes flew non-stop every day. The seven-story "Bandit Suppression Headquarters" building became a battlefield for scrambling for tickets. However, the overwhelming People's Liberation Army rolled towards Shenyang. Pan Yu, the commander of the "ace" New 1st Army, fled back to Shenyang alone on the 29th, repeating only one sentence: "It's all over, it's all over!" According to Song Ziying, the eight departments of the "Bandit Suppression Headquarters" were no longer managed at this time. Large and small officials were looking for ways to grab plane seats. Song and the other two deputy chiefs of staff went to find Chief of Staff Zhao Jiaxiang, but the bandit Zhao gave a bureaucratic reply: "President Chiang's order: there is no need to retreat. Commander Liao will fight with his back to the water!" However, the defeated soldiers who fled back from the west bank of the Liao River shouted in the streets: "The People's Liberation Army has crossed the Liao River!" They scattered their trousers, dragged their broken shoes, and even robbed the "Bandit Suppression Headquarters'" white flour warehouse.
    At 3:00 p.m. on the 29th, at the airport outside Shenyang, two transport planes had already taken off, but were called back by radio telephone. Wei Lihuang's guards rushed forward and dragged all the passengers, who were crying and cursing, off the plane like dead pigs. Wei's guard regiment was distributed on both sides of the airport runway, blocking thousands of large and small "officials." As soon as Wei and several of his direct line senior generals boarded the plane, the airport suddenly erupted in a desperate howl as if the earth had exploded. The fully armed cordon was broken, and black heads rolled towards the plane. One said: "I am the chairman and administrative member!" Another said: "I am the lieutenant general and senior advisor!" Everyone shouted all their official titles and the highest rank, calling for help to Wei who was standing at the mouth of the plane. Peng Jiqun, the chairman of the pseudo-Nenjiang exiled province and secretary-general of "bandit suppression," drove a jeep towards the front of the plane door and was about to step on board when he was kicked over by someone on the plane. However, the bandits were still squeezing, rushing, tearing, and struggling forward in a cry that seemed like the end of the world, almost knocking the fuselage over. Wei was so anxious that he stomped his feet and cursed. Without waiting for the two transport planes to be full, he hurriedly ordered them to flee.

    记东北蒋匪的末日
    华山
    在东北的最后一战中，蒋介石曾满头大汗地奔波于平沈之间，曾三度飞到沈阳“督战”。蒋贼愚蠢而绝望的挣扎是怎样可耻地惨败，以及国民党匪军的崩溃是怎样慌乱和狼狈？记者从放下武器的国民党东北“剿总”中将副参谋长宋子英、廖耀湘兵团参谋长杨昆等人口中知道了这般情景。蒋介石最后一次飞沈督战时，曾经在匆匆召开的军事会议上狂叫道：“照我说的办，失败由我负责！”当时，他说要亲手挽救他最心爱的美械化主力廖耀湘兵团。但是，结果呢？他连沈阳也丢了。
    据宋子英说：“十月初蒋介石把东北败将杜聿明带到沈阳。我们几个副参谋长就私下议论：这次又不知轮到谁倒楣了。”当时，蒋贼口口声声嘶叫：“我是救东北来的”，非要集中全部兵力，“打一个扭转东北战局的锦州大会战”不可。卫匪立煌认为“与其以主力冒险西进，不如乘敌后方空虚，首先接应长春国军回沈。”杜匪却大言不惭地说：“击破林彪主力，还愁什么长春！”尽管卫匪悲鸣“我这总司令干不了”，但蒋贼还是命令廖耀湘成立“西进攻击兵团”，并派杜匪到葫芦岛成立“东进兵团指挥所”。第二天的会议上蒋贼又宣布“留杜长官在这里无条件帮助”，把卫匪这个空头总司令一脚踢开。杜匪就以“总统的高级司令员”的资格，命令廖兵团于十月六日到新民集结完毕，二十日到达大凌河地区，与葫芦岛锦西一线的“东进兵团”“完成南北夹击之情势”。曾经饱受意大利法西斯党和美国帝国主义分子训练的蒋家心腹大将廖耀湘，一向是不把卫匪放在眼里的，这一下由蒋贼亲自指挥，其骄气更不待言。他把主力指向北面的彰武，妄图“切断共军战略供应线和主力南下的通路”，然后南下增援锦州。
    这时，美国通讯社就大吹廖匪“已取得决定性的大捷”。但是，正在这个时候，解放军却以三十一小时的惊人速度，一举攻克锦州，打烂了蒋介石整个“决战”部署，把东北蒋匪一下子摔进欲退无路的绝境。急的蒋贼当天（十月十七日）又第二次飞到沈阳，电令廖匪“不管锦州情况如何，继续西进”。同时他又以手令威逼长春孤军：如不“立即突围”，“即以违抗命令论罪，应受到严厉之军纪制裁”。据被俘的廖兵团参谋长杨昆说：蒋贼飞返北平以后，又用无线电话叮嘱廖匪：“不以驰援锦州之心，而以收复锦州之心迅速前进”，“以死里求生之决心夹击锦州”。但是被解放军声威吓破了心胆的廖匪，这时已经把蒋的命令看成“催命符”了。廖兵团直到十九日还徘徊于新立屯以北。而长春却传出了六十军起义与郑洞国率部投降的消息了。
    蒋贼一连吃了两大闷棍，才知道大势不好，又于十月二十五日第三次飞到沈阳。这次，感到死亡临头的蒋介石已经变得如此惊慌多疑，以致连他二十多年的心腹卫立煌所坐镇的沈阳城也不敢进了。他把卫匪召到机场，就在飞机里面匆匆开了一小时的紧急会议，商议所谓“最后决策”。当时蒋贼估计解放军要南下打锦西、山海关，并如此昏庸地认为经过锦州战役的解放军部队，“半月内不可能进行大战，正是南北夹击之良机”。杜匪也从旁鼓劲说：“打好了，可予敌以痛击，最少也可以保全主力进关。”卫匪这时面有难色，但蒋贼却咆哮道：“我负全责，你们什么也不要管！”蒋贼还责令廖匪亲赴前线指挥，“按原计划日夜兼程，继续西进”。匪首们的会议刚完，蒋贼即于一片残阳中匆匆飞回北平，在不眠之夜守候辽西“捷音”。
    但是从二十三日起，整个廖兵团一直被解放军一个师阻于黑山以北。廖匪把全部主力十二个美械师摆成二十五里宽的正面，以最精锐的七个师，在飞机大炮掩护下，向黑山阵地轮番猛攻，妄想打开西进的道路，攻了两天一夜未得寸进。据杨昆说：当时廖便感到有点不妙了，接着，二十五日夜间，又发现我攻锦主力已经在战场出现，登时慌了手脚，“西进决心整个动摇”。这时，坐在沈阳空城的卫匪，连忙拍电给廖说：“辽河尚无敌情，趁北面未有大接触以前，迅速摆脱战场回沈。”但是廖匪生怕重蹈长春那样的绝境，他没有退向沈阳，却连夜命令各军“原地改变自东向西之正面为自北向南之正面，立即向营口转进”。一时军心惶惶，都向台安涌去。这一支“前呼后拥”的十万人马刚刚跑到绕阳河边，即被从北面猛插下来的解放军兜住去路。廖匪急以四个师猛攻夺路，打了一天也是毫无进展。据杨昆说：二十五日夜间一个“转进”，廖兵团早已搅成一团。十二个师挤在沼泽遍野的五十里平原上，正愁无法整顿队伍，忽接卫立煌从沈阳方面打来的无线电话：“到营口侦察水道的‘重庆号’兵舰搁浅在离港口二十八海里之处，五十二军挤在营口无法登船。”走头无路的廖匪的南下决心动摇了。他命令各部“立即在原地向北面新民转进”。新六军军长李涛、新二十二师师长罗英等都叫苦道：“再转进队伍更无法掌握了”。正在犹疑不决之际，整个廖兵团便为从四面涌上来的解放军团团包围住了。廖匪的兵团司令部又被插到腹心的解放军戳翻。这是二十六日早上的事。这时，在沈阳守着无线电话机的卫立煌，到处联络找不到廖匪和他们四个军部，急得象油锅上的蚂蚁一样，忽然接到蒋贼急电，要他“速令廖部回沈”。卫匪把电报往桌上一扔说：“早不撤，现在到处都粘上了，还撤得动吗！”好容易挨到黄昏，才接到廖匪从新二十二师来的电话，立刻指示突围方向：“北面辽河尚无大的敌情。”廖匪刚刚说声“还不要紧”，电话联络又告中断，从此“情况不明”了。
    新三军暂五十九师师长梁铁豹回忆当时的混乱说：“完全是打的糊涂仗，当了俘虏我还不知道怎么打败的。”仅仅二十六日一天，他就接到五个不同的命令，一时要他“南撤三十里固守”，一时要他“向东渡河进攻”，一时又“立即放弃敌人，向南运动”。他好容易摆脱了追兵，正要集结部队，又被叫向南“突围”，把队伍拖的只剩三个营了。当时已经夜深，他的部队正在向南猛跑，迎面却涌上来了兵团的主力。遍野满是汽车大车炮车和人马，分不清谁是哪军哪师的，只听见一片“向北突围”的呼叫声。梁铁豹也顾不上打听情况，扭转身也跑起来。不料这时解放军又从北面猛插下来，把整个廖匪兵团堵死在人民解放军的口袋里了。
    二十七日晨，绕阳河和柳河的沼泽地上，挣扎着混身烂泥的“王牌军”。河岸上扔满了美国汽车、武器，重炮牵引车倒在路边，榴弹炮在激流里伸出脖子，印着“虎威”、“鹰扬”徽章的吉普车，两年前曾在这块土地上横冲直撞过的，现在沉没在污黑的泥沼里，只露出积满污水的车座了。廖耀湘这个美化的蒋家心腹大将和他的参谋长杨昆，军长李涛几个人在高粱槎子上跑着，身边正跑过去一群群他们亲手训练出来的老兵，可是怎么吆喝也没有人搭理。廖匪只能把身边的两个少将派出去当尖兵。可是，当迎面来了一阵乱枪之后，两个“尖兵”也不知去向了。
    廖兵团的覆没，如同一阵惊涛骇浪，突然扑向蒋卫匪帮这只破船，东北“剿总”群匪只能拿飞机票作“救命符”了。从二十六日起，每天十几趟运输机不停地飞着，七层楼的“剿总”大厦变成了争夺乘票的战场，可是排山倒海的解放军，向沈阳滚滚而来。“王牌”新一军军长潘裕在廿九日独自逃回沈阳，只是重复着一句话：“都完啦，都完啦！”据宋子英谈：“剿总”八大处这时已经无人管了，大小官员们都各自钻门路抢飞机座位去了。宋和另外两个副参谋长一起去找参谋长赵家骧，赵匪却打官腔说：“蒋总统的命令：没有撤退的必要。廖司令官还要背水一战！”但是从辽河西岸逃回的溃兵却满街嚷道：“解放军已经过辽河了！”他们散着裤腿，拖着破鞋，连“剿总”的白面仓库也抢起来了。
    二十九日下午三时，在沈阳郊外的飞机场上，两架运输机已经起飞，又被无线电话叫了回来。卫匪立煌的卫士一拥而上，象拖死猪一样的把连哭带骂的乘客全拖下飞机。卫匪的警卫团分布在飞机跑道两旁，把上千的大小“官员”挡住。卫匪等几个嫡系高级将官一上飞机，机场上顿时便象地球爆炸一样，轰起一阵绝命的猛嗥。全副武装的警戒线被冲垮了，黑压压的脑袋向飞机滚动着。这个说：“我是主席兼行政委员！”那个说：“我是中将参谋兼高级顾问！”每一个都嚷着自己所有的官衔和最大的阶级，向站在飞机口的卫匪呼救。伪嫩江流亡省主席兼“剿匪”秘书长彭济群把吉普朝着飞机门口前开过去，正要迈腿登机，却被机上的人一脚踢翻下来。然而匪帮们还是挤着，扑着，撕打着，在象是世界末日似的呼号中向前挣扎着，差点没把机身撞翻。卫匪急的顿脚大骂，不等两架运输机满座，便仓皇下令飞逃了。          （新华社沈阳十二日电）
