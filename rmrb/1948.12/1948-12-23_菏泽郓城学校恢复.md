　　[Jilu Yu Electric] Elementary school teachers in Heze City and Yuncheng, south of the Yellow River, have recognized the situation, increased their enthusiasm, and are rapidly rectifying and restoring school education. When the Chiang Kai-shek bandits fled Heze, they threatened to return and settle accounts with anyone who approached the Eighth Route Army, causing some teachers to have many ideological concerns. Our staff members, understanding this situation, immediately convened mass meetings in various streets and forums for intellectuals to publicize our party's various policies and the national victory situation. This helped them realize that the Chiang bandits were bound to fail and that the situation in Henan had fundamentally changed, initially transforming the intellectuals' thinking and starting active preparations for school resumption. Now, the First and Third Complete Primary Schools, with more than 300 students, have already resumed classes, and other complete primary schools are also actively preparing to resume classes. In order to rectify educational policies and promptly restore elementary school education, Yuncheng County specifically convened the first session of a three-day forum for 153 teachers, discussing the current situation and how to implement the new democratic education policy. After the discussion, the general teachers dispelled their fears of seesawing back and forth, strengthened their confidence in victory, and eliminated their concerns. Some teachers who had participated in the Three People's Principles Youth League initially dared not fill out the forms clearly, but later voluntarily requested forms to fill out, and confessed that in the past they were not of one mind with the People's Government. At the last collective meeting, everyone clarified how to run schools in the future, and established a system of leave requests, reporting, learning, criticism, and commendation, stipulating that teachers conduct periodic tests. It was decided to evaluate scores based on work enthusiasm, teaching effectiveness, and student performance. Currently, six classes of senior primary school have been restored. Other primary schools are also starting classes one after another.
