Based on this situation, the work team also focused on explaining the attitude that Party members should have towards Party rectification, and used examples of poor relationships between Party members and the masses in the village to illustrate why Party rectification was necessary. They also organized everyone to relate to the situation of their own branch and study and discuss the Party Rectification guidelines of the District Party Committee. After discussion, the demand for improving the atmosphere of the Party gained the upper hand. Many Party members said: "We have done many things that let down the masses, and damaged the Party's reputation. We really can't do without rectification." During the discussion, Party members with fewer mistakes were able to actively reflect on their own faults. However, they were still unwilling to seriously and earnestly criticize important cadres with major mistakes. Some said behind their backs: "If we don't criticize them, we're still afraid that no one will criticize them!" These comrades were mainly afraid of future retaliation. Some comrades, seeing that comrades with major mistakes were worried, felt that criticizing them would make them feel even more uncomfortable, and advocated rectifying slowly. Comrades with major mistakes, on the one hand, wanted to make self-criticisms, but on the other hand, they lacked the courage. They said that it had been too long, they couldn't remember clearly, and they wanted to see how the wind was blowing before deciding.

In response to these situations, the work team also separately criticized various incorrect ideas, and pointed out that the correct attitude and method for a Party member to care for comrades is to use criticism to help comrades correct their mistakes, not to cover up mistakes and allow them to continue to develop, nor to passively wait for the work team and others to criticize while they themselves act as good people. As for retaliation, it is absolutely not allowed.

After everyone's attitude was generally correct, criticism and self-criticism began. At the beginning, it was still first supporting and then criticizing, first saying the good things and then the shortcomings, with a considerable "polite" flavor. After the work team's guidance, encouraging everyone to develop a frank and straightforward spirit, they were gradually able to stand on the Party's position and directly criticize mistakes. The meeting format was a branch general meeting. Because it was the initial stage of Party rectification, no representatives of the masses were invited to participate.

The content of the criticism was mostly about the distribution of fruits (windfall wealth, land, etc.) during the land reform. For example, once when distributing windfall wealth, it was based solely on "debts" and "degree of activism": the village chief and District cadre ×× each received twelve shares, general cadres each received ten to eight shares, activists received six to three shares, and the masses received nothing. In addition to distributing more openly, the main cadres also secretly stole good fruits. There were also malpractices in the distribution of land. The village chief, Li Jinrong, tried his best to distribute good land to people close to him, especially his family members surnamed Li, and distributed bad land to the general public, and in smaller amounts. Jinrong did not admit this (in this Party rectification, the right to speak of a few people was fully guaranteed), and a fierce debate unfolded in the branch. Everyone presented a lot of evidence: Jinrong could not but finally admit his mistakes. After he reviewed his various illegal acts of corruption and theft of fruits, he said sadly: "I am sorry to the masses, sorry to the Party! I used to oppose corruption, why did I also become corrupt? This is forgetting the roots! Forgetting that I used to be a shepherd and a farmhand! Forgetting my brothers!" In addition, the masses also had opinions about the past shareholding in the sulfur kiln and the mobilization for military service. These were thoroughly exposed and criticized in the branch, so that the parties concerned seriously reviewed their mistakes.

### 用实例启发党员说明必须整党

　　用实例启发党员说明必须整党
    根据这种情况，工作组又着重讲了党员对整党应抱的态度，同时以本村党员与群众关系不好的实例，说明党必须整。又组织大家联系本支部情况，学习讨论区党委的整党方针。经过讨论，要求整好党的空气占了上风。不少党员说：“咱们有好多事情对不住群众，把党的名誉也弄坏了，不整可真不行。”讨论中，错误较少的党员都能积极联系反省自己的过错。但对错误大的重要干部，则仍不愿严肃认真的进行批评。有的背后说：“咱不批评吧，还怕没人批评哩！”这些同志主要是害怕将来报复。也有的同志看见错误大的同志发愁，便觉得批评他们怕他们更难受，主张慢慢整。错误大的同志，自己一方面想检讨，一方面又没勇气。他们说，时间太长了，记不清了，想看看风色再说。
    针对这些情况，工作组又分别批判了各种不正确的想法，指出一个党员爱护同志的正确态度与办法，就是用批评来帮助同志改正错误，不是掩护错误，让错误继续发展，也不是消极地等工作组和别人去批评，自己当好人。至于报复，是决不容许的。
    大家的态度大体端正之后，批评与自我批评展开了。开始时还是先拥护后批评，先说好的后说缺点，带着相当“客气”的意味；经过工作组诱导，让大家发扬坦白直率的精神，便逐渐能站在党的立场上，直接了当地批评错误了。会议形式是支部大会，因是初步整党，未请群众代表参加。
    批评内容，大都是土改中分配果实（浮财、土地等）的问题。比如有一次分浮财时，光按“债务”和“积极程度”：村长与区干部××每人顶十二分，一般干部每人顶十分到八分，积极分子六分到三分，群众没分。主要干部除明里多分外，暗里又偷分了好果实。分土地时也有弊病，村长栗金荣把好地尽量分给自己亲近的人，特别是姓栗的本家人，把坏地分给一般群众，而且分得少。这一点金荣不承认（在此次整党中，少数人的发言权是受到充分保障的），支部中便展开激烈的争辩。大家提出许多证据：金荣不能不最后承认自己的错误。他在检讨了自己各种贪污偷窃果实等不法行为后，痛心地说：“我对不起群众，对不起党！我过去也反对过贪污，咱为啥也要贪污？这是忘了本！忘了自己过去也是个放羊放牛做长工的！忘了自己的弟兄！”此外，过去在磺窑入股与参军动员中，群众也有意见，都在支部中进行了彻底的揭发批评，使当事者认真检讨了自己的错误。
