Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 14th: Comprehensive news from various sources: The continuous great victories of the Chinese People's Liberation Army since the Autumn Offensive have been praised and valued in unison by the world's people's forces, led by Communist Parties in various countries. Italian Communist Party leader Togliatti, in a speech to the Italian Parliament on the 2nd of this month, when speaking about the victory of the Chinese People's Liberation Struggle, especially represented the Italian people in paying tribute to the Chinese liberation forces led by Mao Zedong. Japanese Communist Party leader Tokuda Kyuichi, in a commentary published on the 17th of last month, stated: The fate of China has been decided. The national victory of the People's Democratic Government will not take more than a year. American aid to Chiang Kai-shek is already useless. The Soviet Labor Daily commentary on the 2nd of this month and the Information Bureau's magazine "For Lasting Peace and People's Democracy" in November both pointed out: Nothing can stop the victorious advance of the Chinese People's Liberation Movement. American money and guns have proven ineffective in the face of the Chinese people fighting for independence. The French Communist Party's "L'Humanité" stated on the 2nd of last month: "The victory of the Chinese people is the victory of all people fighting for independence. It is a great victory for the cause of peace." The British Communist Party's "Daily Worker" published an editorial titled "Hands Off China" after the liberation of Shenyang, pointing out that the victory of the Chinese people is "an event of great world significance that is changing the face of Asia." The editorial stated: "The British people sympathize with the Chinese people's struggle for democracy and new life, and admire their great achievements in the liberated areas." The editorial also clearly pointed out to the British and world people: "The Chinese people stand on the front line in the struggle for world democratic peace. Our mission today is to express our solidarity with them and declare our opposition to any foreign interference in their struggle. Let the famous saying 'Hands Off China' spread throughout the world."

    【新华社陕北十四日电】综合各方消息：中国人民解放军自秋季攻势以来连续不断的伟大胜利，受到以各国共产党为首的世界人民力量的同声赞扬与重视。意大利共产党领袖托格里亚蒂于本月二日在意议会演说谈到中国人民解放斗争的胜利时，特别代表意大利人民向以毛泽东为首的中国解放力量致敬。日本共产党领袖德田球一则于上月十七日发表评论称：中国的命运已经定了，人民民主政府的全国性胜利将不需一年以上的时间了。美国对蒋介石的援助已经无用。苏联劳动报本月二日评论与十一月份情报局机关杂志“争取持久和平与人民民主”皆一致指出：已没有任何东西能阻止中国人民解放运动的胜利前进。美国的金元与枪炮在为独立而奋斗的中国人民面前，证明毫无效力。法共人道报于上月二日称：“中国人民的胜利，乃是为独立而斗争的一切人民的胜利。它是争取和平的一个大胜利。”英共机关报“工人日报”于沈阳解放后以“勿干涉中国”为题发表社论，指出中国人民的胜利是“改变亚洲面目而具有伟大世界意义的事件”。社论声明：“英国人民同情中国人民为民主和新生而奋斗，并且钦佩他们在解放区的伟大成就。”社论同时向英国和世界人民明确指出：“中国人民在世界民主和平的斗争中站在最前线。我们今天的使命是表达和他们团结一致，声明反对任何外力干涉他们的奋斗。让‘勿干涉中国’这句名言传遍天下。”
