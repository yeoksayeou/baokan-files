　　A Bag of Rice
　　Ning @
　　On the night of October 2nd, the sky was dark, and a cold, damp autumn wind blew across the grassland.

　　Yan Shutian, the communications squad leader of the Third Battalion, was sent from the regimental headquarters to deliver a letter. As soon as he left the north entrance of the village, he saw a faint light from the city of Gui Sui. Knowing that Gui Sui was only thirty-odd miles away, he held his rifle ready as he walked cautiously. Suddenly, a dark shadow flickered in front of him. Xiao Yan immediately lay down on the ground and asked:

　　"Who's there?"

　　The shadow immediately squatted down. Xiao Yan asked two more times, and the shadow stood up and ran. Xiao Yan knew something was wrong, and "Bang!"—he fired a shot! The shadow darted into the sorghum field. Xiao Yan chased after it, and saw a cloth bag full of millet lying straight on the ground. Xiao Yan understood that it wasn't the enemy. So he shouted:

　　"Old fellow, don't run! Come back and carry your rice."

　　"Don't be afraid! Come back and carry your grain."

　　There was no response. The person ran further and further away; the rustling of the sorghum leaves gradually faded and disappeared. Xiao Yan was very dejected. He tested the millet, which weighed at least five big dou. There was no other way, so he had to carry it himself and hurry back to the battalion headquarters.

　　There were many people in the battalion headquarters room: the battalion commander, the political instructor, and the administrator, among others, were gathered around a lamp discussing matters. Because the enemy had come to the village at noon to extort grain, forcing the masses to "empty their houses and clear the fields," the puppet bao and gong suo personnel had also fled. The troops arrived at Guojia Village at dusk to camp, but the "requisition team" had been running around all night without organizing a temporary village public office, and there was nowhere to find grain. The troops' rice bags were also empty, but the higher authorities had ordered "breakfast to be finished by dawn in preparation for battle." It was already midnight, and there wasn't a single grain of rice, so everyone was worried.

　　"Report!" Xiao Yan walked in, panting, with the rice on his back. The administrator helped him put the rice down. He wiped his sweat, reported the situation just now, and said to himself, "How depressing! It nearly crushed me."

　　"This is great, let's just eat it." The administrator, Zhang Xingye, jumped up happily, untied the cloth bag, touched the rice, and looked around at the people, glancing past the battalion commander and stopping on the political instructor's face. Obviously, he was trying to get others' approval.

　　"Yes, let's eat it." Some people expressed their agreement, and added: "Let's eat it first, and return it to the owner tomorrow when we know who it is. That won't be a violation of discipline."

　　The battalion commander didn't say anything.

　　"We can't eat it!" Political Instructor Wang Zhen said decisively: "Based on the situation just now, the rice must belong to the local people. It was wrong to scare someone away by firing a shot. It would be even more detached from the masses if we ate the rice... You must know that this is a new area, and the common people don't understand us yet. If we eat the rice, firstly, we won't have time to levy rice to return to the people if something happens; secondly, even if we return it, the people will not be happy if they see that it's not their own rice." The political instructor then explained the new area policy and the mass discipline. Finally, he solemnly said: "Everyone should remember: the more difficult the environment, the more attention we must pay to discipline. Therefore, the way to handle this bag of rice is to send someone to visit the rice owner tomorrow morning and return it to them." Everyone felt that what the political instructor said was right, and they all agreed to handle it this way—even though they didn't know where the breakfast before dawn would come from.

　　The next morning, the political instructor sent Wang Ziying, the cultural instructor of the Ninth Company, and two communicators to carry the rice and visit the rice owner. According to Xiao Yan, the dark shadow came from the northeast corner of the village. So they first went to six or seven households in the northeast corner of the village to visit each house.

　　"Old fellow! Did anyone in your family go out last night?..."

　　"Um, no!" No matter how the cultural instructor explained the situation last night, how the misunderstanding occurred on the southeastern road of the village, and our policies and disciplines, after asking four or five families, the old folks shook their heads and looked at them with suspicion; it seemed that they knew but dared not say. When they visited the last household, an old woman was sitting in the courtyard crying, showing a look of surprise when she saw them carrying the rice bag. The cultural instructor comforted her kindly and explained their purpose.

　　"If you find the rice owner, you won't do anything to him, right? Um...it's not mine..." The old woman answered incoherently. At this time, many old folks had gathered at the gate of the courtyard, peering in. The cultural instructor understood a little, and invited all the people outside the door to come in, saying to them:

　　"Fu Zuoyi has made the old folks of Suiyuan suffer. We are here to rescue you folks. We will not take a single needle or thread from the masses. The People's Liberation Army and the people are one family." Every sentence struck a chord in the hearts of the people, from what they had heard about the People's Liberation Army in the past, and the experience of the past night—the People's Liberation Army was well-behaved no matter whose house they lived in, and even brought their own lamp oil. The masses began to understand and were moved. The old woman admitted that the rice was hers. Because she was afraid of Fu Zuoyi's demands for grain, last night when the troops came, she thought it was Fu's bandits coming to rob grain in the dark, so she told her son to carry the five dou of freshly milled rice to the field to fortify it, not expecting to run into Xiao Yan.

　　After the cultural instructor handed the rice to her, he said: "Old woman, please write a receipt! It's easier for us to report to higher authorities when we return."

　　"Receipt? Ah!" Before the old woman finished speaking, her son jumped out of the house, grabbed the cultural instructor and enthusiastically invited them into the house: "Don't rush! Comrades, come into the house and have some water before you leave." The cultural instructor explained that they had something to do and couldn't delay any longer. After receiving the receipt, they said goodbye and left. The mother and son and a group of old folks thanked them repeatedly and sent them off.

　　The news immediately spread throughout the village. The masses spontaneously organized a temporary village public office, and the old fellow surnamed Wang who lost the rice was even more active. Before ten o'clock in the morning, rice, flour, firewood, and vegetables were all complete, and the troops' supplies were quickly resolved.

　　一袋米
    宁＠
    十月二号夜，天阴黑，草原上吹来寒湿的秋风。
    三营通讯班长阎树田从团部送信出来，一出村北口，便看见归绥城一片隐约的电灯光；他知道这里距归绥城才三十多里，因此，一出村便把马枪端在手中，小心翼翼的走着。蓦地，前面有条黑影一晃，小阎马上伏在地下问道：
    “干什么的？”
    黑影立即蹲下去。小阎又问了两声，黑影立起身来撒腿就跑。小阎一看事情不对，“叭——”就一枪！那条黑影窜进了高粱地，小阎紧追上去，见地上直挺挺的扔着一条满装小米的布袋。小阎明白了，这不是敌人。便叫：
    “老乡，别跑！回来背你的米。”
    “不要怕！回来背你的粮食。”
    没有一点回音，人越跑越远；高粱叶的哗啦声也渐轻渐消失了。小阎很丧气。试试小米足有五大斗，没有法子，只好自己扛起来，急急地走回营部。
    营部房里有不少人：营长、教导员、还有管理员等围着一盏灯在讨论问题。因为中午敌人还来这村勒索粮食，强迫群众“空舍清野”，伪保公所的人也都跑了。部队黄昏到这郭家营村宿营，“取给组”跑了半夜还没组织起个临时村公所，没处找到粮食。部队上的米袋又吃空了，但上级命令“拂晓吃饭完毕，准备战斗”。现在已经夜半了，还一粒粮食没有，大家正在发愁。
    “报告！”小阎背着米气喘喘地走进来。管理员帮他把米放下。他擦了把汗，把刚才的情况报告后，自言自语的说：“丧气！把我压坏了。”
    “这可好了，就吃了它吧。”管理员张兴业高兴的跳起来，解开布袋，摸着米，眼光射着四周的人，掠过营长，停在教导员面孔上。显然，他是在争取别人的同意。
    “对，吃了吧。”一部分人表示了同意，并补充说：“先吃了，明天知道米主再还他，也不算犯纪律。”
    营长没作声。
    “不能吃！”教导员王振同志斩钉截铁的说：“根据方才情况分析，米一定是老乡的，打一枪把人吓跑了就不对，再吃了米，就更脱离群众了，……要知道，这是新区，老百姓对我们还不了解，倘若吃了米，一来发生情况我们来不及征收米还人家，二来，就是还，老乡一看不是他自己的米，也不高兴。”教导员接着又解释了一阵新区政策，和群众纪律。最后郑重地说：“大家应记住：愈是困难环境，愈要注意纪律。所以这袋米的处理，就是明天清早派人访玉米主，送还人家。”大家都觉得教导员说的很对，都同意这样处理——虽然拂晓前的饭还不知在哪里。
    第二天清早，教导员就派九连文化教员王子英带两个通讯员背上米，去访问米主。据小阎谈，那个黑影来的方向，是在村东北角。他们便首先到村东北角六、七户人家去挨户访查。
    “老乡！你家昨晚有人出去没有？……”
    “嗯，没有！”尽管文化教员怎样解释昨晚情形，解释怎样在村东南路上发生误会，以及我们的政策纪律，但问了四、五家，老乡们都摇着头，用疑惑的眼光看他们；看情形不是不知道，而是不敢说。访问到最后一户，一个老太太正坐在院子里哭，见他们背着米袋进来，显出惊愕的神色。文化教员亲切的安慰她，并说明来意。
    “要是找到米主了，你们不怎的他吧？嗯……不是我的……。”老太太语无论次的回答。这时院门口已集了不少老乡，探头探脑的在观望。文化教员已明白几分了，便把门外群众都请进来，对他们说：
    “傅作义把绥远老乡害苦了，我们到这里来就是为解救老乡们的，我们不拿群众一针一线，解放军和老百姓是一家人。”句句打入群众心坎，从他们过去对解放军的听闻，和一夜来的体验——解放军住在谁家都是规规矩矩，连点灯油都是自己带着的。群众开始明白了，而且感动了。老太太承认米是她的。因傅作义要粮要怕了，昨晚部队来，又以为是傅匪黑夜来抢粮，才叫儿子把刚碾好的五斗米扛到地里去坚壁，不想，却碰到小阎。
    文化教员把米交给她后，说：“老太太，开个收条吧！我们回去好交待上级”。
    “收条？啊！”老太太话未说完，她儿子从屋里跳出来，拉住文化教员热情地向屋里让：“别忙！同志们，到屋里烧口水喝了再走。”文化教员解释有事不能再耽误。接了收条便辞了出来，那娘俩和一群老乡都连声感激送出来。
    消息立即传遍了全村，群众自动组织起临时村公所，丢米的那个姓王的老乡干的更积极。不到上午十点钟，米面柴菜样样齐全，部队的给养很快的便解决了。
