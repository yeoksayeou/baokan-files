Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 29th: The French working people unanimously oppose the new repression bill against strikes that the government is preparing. Agence Telegraphique Parisienne, 25th: The joint committee of the French General Confederation of Labor, the Christian Confederation of Labor, and the "Workers' Force" trade union issued an announcement on the 25th, opposing the new labor repression legislation being prepared by the government. French trade union activists stated that they firmly oppose "any emergency legislation that can be used against the rights enjoyed by workers and the trade union movement – which are their permanent defensive weapons." Note: The Queuille government's anti-labor bill conspiracy has been brewing for a long time, but it has not dared to formally submit it to the parliament due to fear of the unity and persistent struggle of the French working class.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 30th: Agence Telegraphique reports: The French Trade Union Special Committee, including representatives from the General Confederation of Labor, the Christian Confederation of Labor, and the "Workers' Force" trade union, submitted a new wage demand to the government on the 26th, with a minimum monthly wage of 14,674 francs as the base point. The trade unions demanded that wages should be proportional to price changes.
