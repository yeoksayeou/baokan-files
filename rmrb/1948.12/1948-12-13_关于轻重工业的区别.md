    On the Distinction Between Light and Heavy Industry

    Question: What is the basis for distinguishing between light and heavy industry? Why are the wages of workers in heavy industry higher than those of workers in light industry? Why should workers in the military industry receive the same treatment as workers in heavy industry?

    Answer: The distinction between light and heavy industry is determined by the nature of production. General manufacturing that produces "means of subsistence" is collectively referred to as light industry. General manufacturing and mining that produce "means of production" are collectively referred to as heavy industry. This distinction between light and heavy industry roughly corresponds to the weight of the production tools and production objects used. That is to say, heavy industry generally uses heavier machinery and raw materials, while light industry generally uses lighter machinery and raw materials. Specifically, the heavy industry sector includes metallurgy, mining, machine manufacturing, cement manufacturing, electricity, and railways. The light industry sector includes textiles, printing, cigarette production, paper making, leather making, soap production, match production, wine making, glycerin production, pharmaceutical production, pigment production, and oil pressing. The distinction between light and heavy industry is generally limited to the machine industry and does not include handicrafts. Some industrial sectors can be classified into several categories depending on their nature. For example, woodworking can be classified as both handicrafts and light industry depending on the nature of the work. Workers in light industry involved in machinery, electricity, and parts repair, although their work is affiliated with light industry, their task is to manage and repair heavier machinery, such as spinning machines in textile mills and generators in general light industry factories. These technical workers are the same as similar technical workers in heavy industry. However, there are other technicians and technical workers in light industry who belong to light industry, such as textile technicians and technical workers, and leather-making technicians and technical workers. The wages of general heavy industry workers are higher than those of general light industry workers for two reasons: First, in terms of technology, heavy industry has generally more technicians and technical workers, and these technicians and technical workers generally require higher skills than those in light industry, and require considerable time to train and become proficient. Second, in terms of labor intensity, workers in heavy industry expend more labor and the labor intensity is higher.

    The military industry is also a heavy industry. Although it does not produce "means of production," it produces weapons and ammunition, and also uses heavy machinery and heavy raw materials. Their technical conditions and labor intensity are also the same as those of heavy industry workers.

    关于轻重工业的区别
    问：轻重工业根据什么来分？为什么重工业工人的工资要比轻工业工人的高些？为什么军火工业工人要和重工业工人同样待遇？
    答：轻工业和重工业之分，是按生产的性质来决定的。生产“生活资料”的一般制造业，统称为轻工业。生产“生产资料”的一般制造业和矿山开采业，统称为重工业。轻重工业的这种区别，大体上是与它们所使用的生产工具和生产对象的轻重相符合。这就是说，重工业一般使用比较重的机器和原料，轻工业一般使用比较轻的机器和原料。具体说来，属于重工业部门的有如冶金、采矿、机器制造、水泥制造、电力和铁路等；属于轻工业部门的有如纺织、印刷、卷烟、造纸、制革、肥皂、火柴、造酒、甘油、制药、制颜料和榨油等。轻重工业的区分，一般是限于机器工业，不包括手工业在内。有些工业部门，按其性质，也可分属于几个方面。如木工即可按工作性质分属于手工业和轻工业。轻工业中附属的机器、电力、机件修理等部分工人，虽其工作附属于轻工业中，但其工作任务是管理和修理较重的机器，如纱厂的纺织机及一般轻工业工厂的发电机等。这一部分技术工人，也和重工业中同类的技术工人相同。但轻工业中另有属于轻工业的技师和技术工人，例如纺织技师和技术工人，制革技师和技术工人等。一般重工业工人的工资比一般轻工业工人的工资高些，其原因有二：一、在技术方面，重工业的技师和技术工人一般比较多，这些技师和技术工人比轻工业的技师和技术工人一般需要更高的技术，需要相当长时间的培养和训练才能熟练。二、在劳动强度方面，参加重工业的劳动者，其所消耗的劳动力较大，劳动强度较高。
    军事工业也是重工业，虽然不生产“生产资料”，但是生产武器和弹药，同样使用重机器和重原料。他们的技术条件和劳动强度也和重工业工人相同。
