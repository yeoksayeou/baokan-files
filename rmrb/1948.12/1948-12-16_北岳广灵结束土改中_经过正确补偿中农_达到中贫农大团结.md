(Northern Yue News) The land reform work in seventy villages in the old and semi-old areas (second, third, and fourth districts) of Guangling County, Northern Yue District, has been successfully completed because it grasped the main issue of the area—compensating middle peasants who were wrongly struggled against. It also generally applied correct policies and working methods, thus achieving strengthened unity between middle and poor peasants.

According to statistics from twelve villages, including the existing Xia Lingguan, sixty-three households of middle peasants were wrongly classified as rich peasants and struggled against, and one household of poor peasants was wrongly classified as middle peasants. Now their class status has been re-determined. Compensation to the sixty-four middle peasant households amounted to 47.7 *shi* of grain, 36 silver *yuan*, 1,120,008 border region currency, 25 cattle, 13 sheep, and 1 mule. The source of the compensation was partly undistributed floating property and partly items that were over-allocated to poor peasants. In early October, the county committee convened a reporting meeting to conduct inspections and obtain initial experience, which is introduced below.

Party Members Comprehend the Party's Policies
　　The Branch Played a Core Role

After cadres went to the villages to investigate and study the situation, they convened branch meetings, striving to have all members of the branch committee participate. At the meeting, they conveyed the Party's policies, explaining that this correction was to solve the problems left over from land reform, eliminate the knots existing between middle and poor peasants, and appropriately compensate middle peasants who were wrongly struggled against and revise their class status. In explaining the policies, avoid emphasizing one aspect to avoid causing excessive demands among some middle peasants and various anxieties among poor peasants who feared correction and compensation. Party branch members also had good discussions on how to conduct correction in the village, which was very effective. Except for a very few unrighteous party members, all quickly grasped the spirit of the Party's policies. Party members with middle and poor peasant backgrounds all expressed: "It should be returned, the Party is for us to unite and live a good life." When the Dizhuang village branch held a meeting, diligent poor peasant and farmhand party members all felt that middle peasants should be compensated and unanimously criticized the mistakes of party members with vagrant habits and lazy poor peasants who neglected their land. The branch meeting discussed who had been allocated too much land and who had neglected their land (it should be analyzed why the land was neglected, even if it was due to laziness, an educational and transformation approach should be adopted instead of confiscating the land—Editor). This opinion of the branch was unanimously approved by the poor peasant association and made the vast majority of poor peasants and farmhands realize that struggling against their own people was wrong. The party members' self-criticism led to the self-criticism of all poor peasants and farmhands. One party member suggested: "Whoever does not engage in production will not be issued a land certificate," which was also unanimously agreed. The branch committee members of Shangsi branch in the third district criticized the branch secretary for threatening poor peasants and farmhands to return everything, and implemented compensation based on different situations. Liu Zuo, the branch secretary of Liujiagou in the fourth district, enlightened the poor peasants, saying: "We struggled against our own people wrongly. The district asked us to struggle against the landlords, and we shouldn't struggle against anyone who had something. We should admit our mistakes." Under his efforts, middle and poor peasants smiled at each other: "One family split in two."

Convening Meetings of Poor Peasants and Farmhands
　　Discussing How to Compensate Middle Peasants

In continuing to complete the work of correction, the Guangling County Committee implemented the policy of relying on poor peasants and farmhands and opening up their minds to solve the problems left over.

After the branch meeting was successfully held, the spirit of the Party's policies could also be brought to the poor peasant association to create favorable conditions for holding a good poor peasant association meeting. At the poor peasant association meeting, in addition to explaining the Party's policies, the work team emphasized that "struggling against middle peasants was wrong, and the leadership also had shortcomings. We should return the things that were wrongly struggled against as much as possible." They also enlightened the poor peasants and farmhands to deliberate and discuss the incorrectness of struggling against middle peasants and how to conduct correction. After discussion, the leaders proposed to see how many families in the village were wrongly struggled against and how much could be returned. At the beginning of the discussion, a few vagrants and opium addicts resisted fiercely. They said: "Go find Chairman Mao! I ate it!" But diligent poor peasants disagreed with their opinions. Diligent poor peasants criticized vagrants: "You have neglected the land, and we also blush when we see middle peasants." In the end, they all felt that middle peasants should be compensated. They resolved: "Confiscate the land from whoever has been allocated too much land, confiscate the land from whoever has neglected it without reason, and whoever does not engage in production will not be issued a land certificate for the time being, and will be issued when they engage in production!" Because righteousness prevailed, the correction work was also smooth. Poor peasants in Haizi Village all felt: "The beginning of this year is good, nothing is wrong." After deliberation, the poor peasants in Shangsi voluntarily reported the amount to be compensated. The work team mobilized not to let the compensation affect life and production, and as a result, everyone had no objections and collected eight *shi* of grain. The poor peasants in Shanglingguan discussed how to compensate and how much was left, and the land was drawn from the landlord's excess to compensate the middle peasants.

Holding Meetings of Wrongly Struggled Middle Peasants and Middle Peasants, emphasizing that during last year's land reform, the leadership had problems in mastering the policies, and the standards for class division were unclear, and the leadership should be responsible. Those who were wrongly classified should have their class status changed, and those who were wrongly struggled against should be appropriately compensated so that everyone can unite better to engage in production and live a good life. Middle peasants generally had very high spirits when they heard about changing their class status and compensation. The leadership emphasized that the explanation of the correction was to eliminate the estrangement between middle and poor peasants and unite their own families, so that the peasant family would not be divided in two. It would be even better if all compensation could be made, but it is best for a family not to hurt harmony. What if all the compensation cannot be made? It is still best for everyone to discuss and handle it well, and enlighten the middle peasants to be tolerant. The middle peasants in Dizhuang did not have many opinions on righteous poor peasants, only on lazy people who were allocated too much land and neglected it. Middle peasant Liu Yanchang said: "Now the superiors are here to correct it, let's engage in production well!" In the end, everyone expressed that they did not want the land: "Chairman Mao wants everyone to have food to eat and help the poor people turn over!" The branch secretary of Liujiagou explained the Party's policies to the middle peasants, and the district cadres also admitted at the meeting that it was mainly the district's mistake (a specific self-criticism should be made to distinguish responsibilities—Editor), which turned around the middle peasants' spirits.

Revising the Wrongly Classified Class Status
　　Poor and Middle Peasants Untie Their Knots

In addition to explaining the policies of unity and production at the conference, the leadership admitted that there were problems in mastering the policies during the land reform. It enlightened poor peasants and middle peasants to untie their knots and unite in production. It is an important link in the correction to discuss and solve problems with middle and poor peasants. Liujiagou, through the core role of the branch and the leadership's admission of mistakes, everyone was very united when the final conference was held. Middle and poor peasants laughed when they met: "One family split in two." Middle peasants said: "It's different from the past, the district cadres go there and also go here." At the meeting, the branch secretary made a self-criticism on behalf of the poor peasants and admitted mistakes. One poor peasant said: "It can't only be the district's mistake, we also have mistakes." The middle peasant said: "I don't want my grain anymore." Poor peasant Liu Bingcai said: "Struggling against those who carried out long-term labor, it's hard to pass the conscience." The middle peasant said: "Next year, we must engage in production even better, and harvest more grain than this year. I feel relieved now." Li Tang, a middle peasant in Shanglingguan, requested the return of farm tools and four *mu* of paddy fields, which was agreed by all the poor peasants. In Shangsi, Shaojiazhuang, Haizi and other villages in the third district, middle and poor peasants individually sought objects to discuss and compensate for things, and the atmosphere was extremely amiable. (Individual seeking of objects should not be advocated—Editor)

(1) The main link of the correction is repeatedly emphasizing and explaining the Party's policies. Righteous poor peasants raise their heads and will quickly accept the spirit of the policies, and severely criticize lazy vagrants, and can also come up with solutions. At the beginning, do not talk about resolutely returning things to make poor peasants afraid and fuel the growth of retaliatory thoughts among middle peasants.

(2) The leaders should admit to the wrongly struggled middle peasants that there were problems in mastering the policies, which can quickly turn around the middle peasants' spirits, and enlighten the middle peasants to understand that the correction is to eliminate estrangement and disunity and step up production, and not allow retaliatory thoughts to grow. There are retaliatory thoughts among the middle peasants. If not well grasped, there will be a greater deviation, making the countryside even more disunited.

(3) The final unity meeting is also very important, so that middle and poor peasants can communicate, break the boundaries, speak their minds, announce the end of land reform, issue land certificates, and no longer distribute land equally. Middle and poor peasants will be more at ease and will unite more, and their production enthusiasm will be higher.

　　北岳广灵结束土改中
  　经过正确补偿中农
  　达到中贫农大团结
    【北岳讯】北岳区广灵县老区半老区（二、三、四区）七十多村的结束土改工作，由于抓住了该地主要问题——补偿错斗中农，并在掌握政策与工作方法上一般比较正确，所以达到了中贫农团结加强，工作顺利完成。
    据现有下灵关等十二个村的统计，中农划成富农斗了的六十三户，贫农划成中农的一户，现在都已改订了成份。补偿中农六十四户，补偿粮食四七·七石，白洋三十六元，边币一一二○○○○八元，牛二十五头，羊十三只，骡一个。补偿东西的来源，一部分是未分的浮财，一部是贫农多分的东西。十月初旬县委召集汇报会议，进行检查，获得初步经验，兹将其介绍于后。
    党员领会党的政策
  　支部起了核心作用
    干部下乡对村中情况调查研究后，召集支部会，尽可能使全部支委党员都参加，会上传达党的政策，说明这次纠偏是为解决土改遗留的问题，解除中贫农间存在的疙瘩，并适当补偿错斗中农，改订成份。在解释政策中，避免强调一面，以引起一部分中农当中的过分要求、及贫农怕纠偏补偿的各种不安情绪。支部党员并很好的讨论了如何在村里进行纠偏，这样收到很大成效。除极少数不正派的党员外，都很快的领会了党的政策精神。中贫农成份的党员都表示：“应该退，党是为了咱团结过好光景”。底庄村开支部会时，勤劳的贫雇农党员都认为应该给中农退，并一致批评了有二流子习气的党员及烟鬼懒汉贫农荒了地的错误，在支部会上讨论出谁分的地过多抽谁的，谁荒了地抽谁的（应分析是什么原因荒的，即使是因为懒惰荒的，亦应采取教育改造方针，而不应抽地——编者），支部这个意见在贫农会上得到了全体赞成，并使绝大部分贫雇农认识斗了自家人是不对的，党员的检讨，带动了全体贫雇农检讨。一个党员提议：“谁不生产不发给他土地证”，也得到全体同意。三区上寺支委党员批评了支书威胁贫雇农全部退东西，实行分别情况去补偿。四区刘家沟支书刘佐启发贫农说：“咱们斗错了自家人，区里是叫咱们斗地主，不该见有的就斗；咱们应该承认错误”。中贫农会上贫农对中农检讨：“我们斗错了”。他说：“错由我负责，不管怎样我们领导上要负责”。在他努力下，中贫农一见就笑起来：“一家人分了两半子”。
    召开贫雇农的会议
  　讨论怎样补偿中农
    广灵县委在继续完成纠偏工作中，贯彻了依靠贫雇农并打通他们的思想，去解决遗留问题的方针。
    支部会开好了，党的政策精神也可以带到贫农团里来，给开好贫农团会造下了有利的前提条件。在贫农团会上，工作组除解释党的政策外，强调说明“斗中农是不应该的，领导上也有缺点，咱们应该把错斗的东西，尽可能退回去。”并启发贫雇农酝酿讨论认识斗中农的不对，如何进行纠偏。进行讨论后，领导上又提出看咱村错斗了几家，能退多少东西，开始讨论时，少数二流子烟鬼抵抗得很利害。他们说：“找毛主席去吧！我吃了！”但勤劳的贫农不同意他们的意见。勤劳贫农批评二流子：“你们荒了地，我们见了中农也是脸红脖子粗的。”最后都认为应该补偿中农。并决议：“谁分的地过多抽谁的，谁无故荒了抽谁的，谁不生产当下不发给他土地证，啥时生产了再发给他！”由于正气抬头，纠偏工作也很顺利，海子村贫农都认为：“今年年头好，没什么”。上寺贫农经过酝酿，都自动报了补出的数字。工作组动员不要因补出东西影响生活、生产，结果大家都无意见，凑了八石粮食。上岭关贫农讨论了如何补，还剩多少东西，土地则从地主超过数里抽出补偿中农。
    召集错斗中农与中农会议，强调指出去年土改时，领导上掌握政策有毛病，划阶级标准不明确，领导上应该来负责。错划了的要改变成份，错斗了的要适当补偿，使大家更团结起来好好生产，过好光景。中农听说改成份、补偿，一般的情绪都是很高的。领导上强调解释纠偏是解除中贫农间的疙瘩，使自家人团结起来，不使农民一家人分两半子。如能补偿全部则更好，但一家人以不伤和气为最好，如果补不上全部来怎么办呢？还是大家商量着办好，启发中农忍让。底庄中农对正派贫农意见不多，只对懒汉多分地荒了的有意见。中农刘彦长说：“现在上级来纠正哩，好好生产吧”！最后大家表示不要地了：“毛主席叫人人有饭吃，帮助穷人翻了身吧”！刘家沟支书给中农解释了党的政策，区干部也在会上承认主要是区里的错误（应具体检讨，分清责任——编者），这样就把中农的劲头转变了过来。
    改订划错了的成份
  　贫雇中农解开圪＠
    大会上除解释团结生产政策外，领导上承认土改时掌握政策有毛病。启发贫农中农解开疙瘩团结生产。中贫农互相商量解决问题，这是纠偏当中重要的环节。刘家沟经过支部的核心作用，领导上承认错误，最后开大会时大家都很团结。中贫农一见都笑起来：“一家人分了两半子”。中农说：“和过去不同了，区干部到那边也到这边。”开会了，支书代表贫农检讨承认错误，一个贫农说：“不能光是区里的错误，咱们也有错误”。中农说：“我的粮食不要了”。贫农刘丙才说：“斗了些扛过长工的，问良心也问不过去”。中农说：“明年更要好好生产，比今年打的粮食更多，这一下安心了”。上岭关中农李唐要求退回农具和四亩水地得到全体贫农同意，三区上寺、邵家庄、海子等村都是中贫农互相个人找对象商量着补的东西，空气极为和蔼。（个人找对象不应提倡——编者）
    （一）纠偏的主要环节，是反复的强调的说明党的政策，正派的贫农抬起头来，会很快接受政策精神，并严厉的批评懒汉二流子，也能想出办法。开始时不要讲坚决退东西，使贫农害怕，助长中农当中一些报复思想的生长。
    （二）领导上应该向错斗中农承认掌握政策有毛病，这样可以很快把中农的劲头转过来，启发中农了解纠偏是为了解除隔阂不团结，加劲生产，不使报复思想生长。中农当中是有报复思想的，如不很好掌握，更会发生大的偏向，使农村更加不团结。
    （三）最后的团结大会也很重要，使中贫农通了气，打破界线，把话说通，宣布土改结束，发土地证，再不平分，中贫农更安心，更会团结起来，生产情绪更高。
