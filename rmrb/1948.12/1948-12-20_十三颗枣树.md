Thirteen Jujube Trees
	Xing Heng

	On the midnight of November 14, 1948, the moonlight shone on the eastern mountains of Taiyuan. "Sha, sha, sha..." The troops, amidst the sporadic sounds of artillery fire, quietly wound their way along the mountain road, reaching the very front. Vice-Company Commander An Quanwa, wiping the sweat from his forehead with his sleeve, called the assault squad leader Wang Jinrong to his side and said in a low voice, "You need to familiarize yourself with the terrain to be more confident. Come, I'll take you to see Position No. 5." This wiry young man, with eyes full of respect and admiration, glanced at the sweat-drenched face of the Vice-Company Commander and cheerfully said, "Right!" He then tucked in his belt full of grenades, slung a Type 38 rifle over his shoulder, and followed the Vice-Company Commander along the ridge, past the ruined and crumbling No. 14 blockhouse, all the way towards the enemy's Position No. 5. The thorns and small grass along the roadside rustled, as if seeing them off.

	Vice-Company Commander An was very familiar with this path, which was not really a path at all. He had been here twice before; he walked as effortlessly as if it were the lane in his own home, without a second thought. When they reached the eyebrow of the cliff on the west side of the mountain ridge, he suddenly twisted his body, and Wang Jinrong, unable to stop, almost bumped into him. He straightened up and pointed ahead, saying, "We're here, ahead is Pine Ridge; the enemy's position across from it, that's Position No. 5." Four eyes stared intently for two minutes. Then, he made a gesture, and Wang Jinrong followed him down a dirt bank, until they were forty meters away from Blockhouse No. 5. At this moment, Wang Jinrong crawled forward a bit, stretched his neck and saw: In a small house below, a bright light was on – probably the enemy's kitchen. Other than that, there was no movement; the night was so quiet. He crawled back and reported the situation. Finally, Vice-Company Commander An was still not at ease, and he took him over for the third time, giving him a thorough look at the assault route and the enemy's machine gun bunkers. "See clearly? Let's go back..." As soon as they turned around, they suddenly spotted a group of dark figures ahead. An Quanwa whispered, "That's the enemy!..." Before he could finish speaking, pfft, pfft, pfft... a burst of bullets came over, Wang Jinrong jumped violently and fell into a pool of blood, An Quanwa felt as if he had been hit by a pile of bricks on his back, numb and hot, with blood gushing out in two places – his calf was also broken. At this time, the enemy shouted in panic, "The Eighth Route Army is attacking our rear!..." Seventeen enemies nervously rushed over. An Quanwa gritted his teeth, used all his strength, pulled over the Type 38 rifle, and with a few shots, bang, bang, bang, three of the enemy's dark figures fell one after another... "Damn you, come on!" He panted and waited for a full three minutes, but there was no movement, – the enemy was probably scared away. He pulled at Wang Jinrong, – he didn't move. He felt a pang of sorrow, and without thinking about anything else, he mustered all his strength and crawled back twenty meters. By a cluster of jujube trees, his whole body had turned into a pile of soft mud, and he could no longer move. He gripped his gun tightly, thinking, "I can't just leave you behind, you are a revolutionary weapon bought with blood and sweat!" He crawled into a small jujube grove, counted them, and found there were thirteen in total. He then fainted on and off, using his bloody hands to dig a pit, burying the gun in it; then he gathered his strength and crawled into a small cave in a hollow, where he completely lost consciousness.

	Dawn broke, and he woke up, still quiet with no one around. He tried to struggle, but the piercing pain made his eyes go black and he became confused again. Another day passed, and he regained consciousness; he thought, "Our people will come..." Listening and listening, ... it sounded like footsteps were coming. He wanted to shout, but his mouth seemed to be pasted shut and he couldn't call out. He endured the pain and used all his strength to shout, – but it was still like a fly buzzing. The soldiers of the Fifth Company, who were doing construction work in front, heard a sound, and threw a grenade over, with a boom, the entire cave was filled with smoke and dust. He didn't know where he got the strength to shout, "Don't shoot! I am An Quanwa of the Seventh Company..." Three soldiers ran into the cave, warmly embraced him, and were so heartbroken and happy that they couldn't speak.

	They carried him to the command post, and everyone surrounded him with concern. The doctor, under the flickering light, carefully applied medicine to his wounds. He excitedly mustered all his strength and said to Vice-Political Commissar Han, "I'm back, the gun is buried under the thirteen jujube trees, – I can still participate in the battle!"

　　十三颗枣树
    行型
    一九四八年十一月十四日的午夜，月光正照着太原的东山。“沙、沙、沙……”部队在断续的炮声里，悄悄地绕着蜿蜒的山路，开到了最前边。副连长安全娃，用袖子一摸额上的汗珠，就把突击班长王金荣叫到跟前，悄声地说：“你得熟习一下地形，才会更有把握。走，我带你去看看五号阵地。”这个精悍的小伙子，用敬爱钦佩的眼睛，向副连长的汗脸上一扫，愉快地说声“对！”就掖好了满腰手榴弹，扛上三八式马枪，跟着副连长顺着上脊，通过已被毁灭了的乱石崩离地十四号碉，一直向着敌五号阵地摸去。——路旁的荆棘和小草，尖声地替他们送着行。
    这样不是路的路，安副连长是很熟悉的，——他已到这里看过两次了；和自己家里的甬道一样，毫不思索地走着。到了山梁西边的眉崖上，他猛的一扭身子，王金荣止不住步，几乎和他碰个满怀。他身子一挺，指着前边说：“到了，前面就是松树岭；敌人的阵地对过那就是五号地”四只眼睛凝神地端祥了两分钟，然后，他做了一个手势，王金荣又随他顺着一个土坎子摸下去，直到离五号碉四十公尺。这时王金荣又往前爬了一截，伸长脖子一看：下边一座小房里，点着明晃晃的灯——大概是敌人的火房。此外什么动静也没有，夜是那么安静。他照样爬回来，报告了情形。最后安副连长还不放心，又带他第三次爬过去，把冲锋道路和敌人机枪掩体又看了个够。“看清楚了吧？回……”他们刚一转身，忽而发现前面有一群黑影，安全娃悄声地说：“那是敌人！……”话未说完，噗噗噗……一梭子子弹打过来，王金荣猛地一跳倒在血泊里，安全娃觉得脊背好象挨了一顿砖头，木腾腾地热辣辣地两处冒血，——小腿也给打坏啦。这时敌人惊慌地叫着：“八路来抄咱后路啦！……”十七个敌人战战兢兢地冲过来了，安全娃咬紧牙关，用尽了全身气力，拉过三八式，砰、砰、砰几枪，敌人的黑影先后倒了三个……“狗日的你来吧！”他喘着气足足等了三分钟，却什么动静也没有了，——敌人大概吓跑啦。他拉了一下王金荣，——不动了；他鼻子一酸，再顾不得想什么，就鼓足了劲，往回爬了二十公尺。到一簇枣树边，全身已成了一堆软泥，再也动不得了。他紧握着枪，想：“总不能把你丢掉了，你是血汗换来的革命武器呀！”他又爬进一丛小枣林，数了一数，共十三棵，就昏一阵迷一阵地用血手挖了一条坑，把枪埋进去；再鼓鼓劲又爬进一个凹地的小窑洞里，他就完全失掉了知觉。
    天亮了，他清醒过来，还是静悄悄地没有一个人。他想挣扎一下，刺心的奇痛使得他两眼一黑又迷糊了。一天又过去了，他又有了知觉；他想：“咱们人总要来的……”听着听着，……好象来了脚步声，他想喊，可是嘴好象浆糊糊住一般叫不出来。他忍着疼，用足了气力喊了一声，——还是和蝇子叫着似的。到前边做工事的五连战士们走近了，一听有声音，就扔过来一个手榴弹，轰的一声，满窑弥漫了烟土。他不知从哪里来了那股劲喊着：“不要打！我不是敌人，我是七连安全娃……”三个战士跑进窑里，亲热地抱住他，心痛和高兴得说不出话来。
    把他抬到指挥所，大家都关切的围着他，医生在闪闪地灯光下，小心地给他上着药。他兴奋地鼓了最大的劲儿，对韩副政委说：“我回来了，枪埋在十三棵枣树下，——我还能参加战斗呀！”
