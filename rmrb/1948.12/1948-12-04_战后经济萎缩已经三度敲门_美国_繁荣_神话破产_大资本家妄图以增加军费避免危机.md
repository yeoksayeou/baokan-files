Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 30th: TASS Moscow, 24th: Chiprakov published an article in Pravda entitled "The Bankruptcy of the Myth of American Post-War 'Prosperity'." The article stated in brief: American monopoly capital has done its utmost to spread the myth of American post-war "prosperity." They need this myth to conceal the bankruptcy of the dying capitalist system from the American people and to convince those countries that have become victims of American monopoly capital's expansionism of the "genius of American construction" and the "excellence of the American way."

America cannot guarantee full employment for its people in peacetime. According to official statistics, the number of officially registered unemployed reached 2.2 million, a figure that is at most only one-third of the actual number of unemployed. This number does not include the millions serving in the military, so the number of unemployed is artificially reduced. In addition, even official estimates say that 8 million people are partially employed.

The American ruling circles are now spreading an illusion: that the "Marshall Plan" and "aid" to China, Greece, and Turkey are panaceas for all economic misfortunes, saying that this can expand foreign markets for American goods. But in reality, goods shipped abroad under the Marshall Plan and various "aid" plans cannot make up for the gap in American exports caused by foreign countries reducing their orders from the U.S. The solvency of the capitalist world has been lowered by the foreign expansion of American monopoly capitalists. America's exports far exceed its imports. For example, in 1947, the difference between American exports and imports reached $11.4 billion, compared with $500 million before the war. Other capitalist countries have been forced to sacrifice their gold, dollar funds, and their short-term investments in the United States. These countries are increasingly unable to pay for purchases from the United States.

Due to the expenses of the so-called "foreign aid plan" that profits monopoly capitalists, domestic prices in the United States have inflated to an extreme degree. In the final analysis, the American financial oligarchy is pocketing billions of dollars in foreign aid. Inflationary policies and price increases are to the liking of American monopoly capital. They are launching a full-scale attack on the living standards of the working people. American workers' wages lag far behind prices. Price inflation is the blatant plunder of the people by monopoly capitalists.

Due to famine in Western Europe and rising domestic prices, American monopoly capitalists who hold and sell agricultural products have made a great fortune. The profits of America's twenty largest grain companies in the first half of 1947 exceeded $1 billion, twice as much as the previous year. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, grain prices in 1948 were nearly twice the average grain prices between 1935 and 1939. The rise in grain prices is caused by the policies of grain monopolists and should not be blamed on American small farmers. The fate of American small farmers is poverty, exhaustion from labor, and miserable lives.

Parallel to the unlimited expansion of American monopoly capital is the rapid growth of militarism. American warmongers are doing their utmost to portray the arms race as the savior of the American economy, insisting that "armaments stimulate business." In doing so, they openly admit that American capitalism can only sustain industry by following a path of war, not to mention that the arms race itself will lead to great economic disasters. The arms race harms industry, expands the production of war materials, and reduces the production of consumer goods, resulting in rising prices. Due to the militarization of the American economy, monopoly capital has increased the burden on the working people. The United States has begun a campaign to reduce the production of consumer goods and cut back on housing construction plans, while also proposing increases in indirect taxes and consumption taxes.

The decline in the living standards of the masses, inflation, the reduction in real wages, unemployment, bankruptcy and the impoverishment of farmers, the increase in militarism, the instability of the entire economy, and anxiety about the future - this is the true state of affairs in America today.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 30th: Telecommunications Agency, New York, 25th: The Associated Press's Wall Street correspondent reported that the American economy has reached a point where action must be taken to support current activity. Before the end of the year, the Truman administration must decide whether to fulfill its election promises to support the American economy, or to give the American economy another shot in the arm in the form of increased military spending. Since the end of the war, various support methods have been used. First, industry and commerce stockpiled large quantities of raw materials and commodities. Second, there was a post-war expansion of factories and equipment. Third, there was the Marshall Plan and military expansion. This week's Business Daily stated that "economic recessions have knocked on the door three times since the end of the war, and each time they were avoided by using these support methods." The paper pointed out that, however, industry and commerce have now completed their normal stockpiling, the post-war industrial expansion has slowed down, and although there is the Marshall Plan, exports have been gradually declining over the past year. The Business Daily stated that if serious difficulties are to be avoided, there must be new support methods. The paper warned: It should be remembered that "we are now living on a volcano that could erupt at any time." Big businessmen are openly promoting the outrageous method of preparing for war to avoid a crisis. According to the Wall Street journal Barron's Weekly, "a 'rearmament plan' must be used to avoid the trend of economic depression." Barron's Weekly warned that "if military spending is not greatly expanded, there will be a price crash." Therefore, the magazine attacked the "temptation" of peace and urged new huge budgets for war preparations.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 27th: Washington news: Although the United States has nearly $7 billion in foreign aid plans this year, it has still failed to stop the trend of its shrinking exports. According to a report from the U.S. Department of Commerce, the total value of U.S. exports in September was $926.5 million, compared with $988.2 million in August, a significant decrease from the average export value of more than $1.1 billion per month in the first half of this year. In the first half of this year, the total value of U.S. exports was $6.7 billion, a decrease of 17 percent compared with the same period last year. If the three months of July, August, and September are included in the calculation, the total value of exports in the first nine months of this year decreased by 19 percent compared with the same period last year. Due to rising prices and the devaluation of the dollar, the actual rate of decline in exports is likely to be even greater.

### 战后经济萎缩已经三度敲门　美国“繁荣”神话破产  大资本家妄图以增加军费避免危机

　　战后经济萎缩已经三度敲门
  　美国“繁荣”神话破产
    大资本家妄图以增加军费避免危机
    【新华社陕北三十日电】塔斯社莫斯科二十四日讯：契普拉柯夫在真理报上撰文，题为“美国战后‘繁荣’神话的破产”。该文略称：美国独占资本尽了他们最大的力量来散布关于美国战后“繁荣”的神话。它们需要用这种神话在美国人民面前掩饰垂死的资本主义制度的破产，并使那些已成为美国独占资本扩张主义牺牲品的国家，相信“美国的建设天才”和“美国方式的卓越”。
    美国在和平时期并不能保证人民的充分就业。据官方统计，正式登记的失业人数达二百二十万人，这一数目至多只是实际失业人数的三分之一。这一数目不包括成百万服兵役的人在内，因此，失业的数目是人为地减少了。此外，连官方也估计有八百万人是部分就业。
    美国统治集团现在正在散布一种幻想：即“马歇尔计划”和对中国、希腊、土耳其的“援助”，是医治一切经济不幸的万应灵药，说这能为美货扩大外国市场。但在实际上，根据马歇尔计划及对各国“援助”计划而运往外国的货物，并不能弥补因外国减少向美订货所造成的美国出口中的缺口。资本主义世界的支付能力，因美国独占资本家的对外扩张而降低了。美国的输出超过输入甚多。例如一九四七年，美国输出和输入的差额达一百一十四亿美元，而战前则为五亿美元。其他资本主义国家已被迫牺牲他们的黄金、美元基金以及他们在美国的短期投资。这些国家越来越无力支付自美国的购货。
    由于为独占资本家谋利的所谓“援外计划”的开支，美国国内的物价已极度膨胀。归根结底，美国财政金融寡头是把数十亿元的援外费用，都装进自己的钱袋。膨胀政策和提高物价，正适合于美国独占资本的胃口。它们向劳动人民的生活水平发动全力进攻。美国工人的工资远落在物价之后。物价膨胀是独占资本家对人民的露骨的掠夺。
    由于西欧的饥荒和国内物价的上涨，握有和出售农产品的美国独占资本家就大大发财了。美国二十个最大粮食公司一九四七年上半年所得的利润超过十亿美元，为前一年的两倍。据美国农业部称：一九四八年中的粮价，几为一九三五年和一九三九年平均粮价的两倍。粮价的上涨是由于粮食垄断者的政策所引起的，因而不应责难美国的小农民。美国小农民的命运是贫困，精疲力竭地劳动和凄惨地生活。
    和美国独占资本之无限制的扩张相并行的，是迅速增长的军国主义。美国的战争挑拨者极力把军备竞赛说成是美国经济的救星，硬说“军备刺激商业”。他们这样做时公然承认美国资本主义只有遵循战争的方针，才能使工业维持下去，且不说这一点，军备竞赛本身就将导向经济大难。军备竞赛损害工业，扩充作战物资的生产，减缩消费品的生产，结果使物价上涨。由于美国经济的军事化，独占资本加重了劳动人民的负担。美国已开始进行减少消费品生产和减缩造屋计划的运动，同时提出增加间接税和消费税的要求。
    群众生活水平的降低，通货膨胀，实际工资的减少，失业，破产和农民的贫困，军国主义的增涨，整个经济的不稳，以及对明天的忧虑，这就是美国今天的真实情况。
    【新华社陕北三十日电】电通社纽约二十五日讯：美国报联社华尔街访员称：美国经济已达到必须采取行动才能支持目前活动的地步了。在年终以前，杜鲁门政府必须决定：究将实现其选举诺言来支持美国经济呢，还是以增加军费的形式再给美国经济打上一针。自战争结束以来，业已使用过各种支持的办法。第一，工商业大量储存原料与商品。第二，战后扩充工厂与装备。第三，是马歇尔计划与扩军。本周的商务日报称，“自战争结束以来，经济萎缩业已三度敲门，而每次都是由于使用这些支持办法而幸免了。”该报指出：然而现在，工商业已完成其正常的储存，战后工业扩充已日益减缓，虽然有马歇尔计划，一年来出口额已逐渐下降。商务日报称：如果要避免严重的困难，就必须要有新的支持办法。该报警告称：应该记住：“我们现在正生活在一座火山上，随时都有爆发的可能。”大企业家们正在公开地宣传用准备战争来避免危机的狂妄办法。据华尔街机关刊拜龙周杂志称：“必须‘用重整军备计划’来避免经济萧条的趋势。”拜龙周刊警告称：“如不大量扩充军备，则将发生物价暴跌。”因此，该杂志攻击和平的“诱惑”，并敦促以新的巨额预算从事战争准备。
    【新华社陕北二十七日电】华盛顿消息：美国今年虽有近七十亿美元的援外计划，但仍然未能阻止其输出萎缩的趋势。据美商务部报告，美国九月份的出口总额为九亿二千六百五十万美元，八月份为九亿八千八百二十万美元，较今年上半年每月十一亿美元以上的平均出口额下降甚多。今年上半年美国出口总额为六十七亿美元，较去年同期下降百分之十七，如将七、八、九三个月计算在内，则今年头九个月出口总额较去年同期下降达百分之十九。由于物价上涨和美元贬值，输出实际跌落的比率，当比这更大。
