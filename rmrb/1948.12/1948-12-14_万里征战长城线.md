    Ten Thousand Li Expedition on the Great Wall Line

  (4) Highly Mobile Warfare
    Fu Zuoyi deployed a one-character long snake formation, but his forces were insufficient. In terms of tactics, he had to strengthen his fortifications and adopt the so-called "using main force against main force" and "using concentration against concentration" walnut tactics. The task of our unit at that time was to contain and annihilate the enemy, and to cooperate with friendly forces in rest and combat. In order to break the enemy's tactics, we had to implement highly mobile warfare: when the enemy concentrates, we disperse; when the enemy disperses, we concentrate; when the enemy suddenly disperses, we suddenly concentrate; when the enemy suddenly concentrates, we suddenly disperse, so that the enemy has nothing to do, and we have something to do.
    The first time the troops left the area for a long expedition, and also implemented highly mobile warfare, they encountered two major difficulties in their thinking: the first was the issue of field operations; the second was the issue of hardship. Many soldiers, and even some cadres, had conservative family concepts and regional concepts, and always wanted to return to their area; and in difficult environments, a few people said strange things and were afraid of climbing mountains and walking.
    The troops repeatedly educated on these two issues. Some units adopted the education method of soldiers educating soldiers and the masses educating the masses, and carried out mass line education methods such as "pouring out grievances," "comparing hardships," "contributing thoughts," "digging out thoughts," and "talking about the situation and loving history (one's own revolutionary history)." A certain unit carried out a "three comparisons and four comparisons" movement, that is, cadres compared three things: determination, progress, and achievements; soldiers compared four things: hardship, skills, discipline, and courage. This was a new heroic method of mobilizing the masses after the three check-ups and complaining education movement, which played a considerable role in solving these two ideological problems. During marching, if someone lagged behind, as soon as they heard someone shout, "Compare hardships!" the people behind would consciously follow up, because the soldiers all had self-esteem and always felt that if others could follow, they could also follow. Once, when crossing the Pinggu Road, a certain unit was tasked with destroying and guarding, and traveled 413 li (including rest and meals) in 92 hours, including 230 li from Fenzhuang to Yongning, walking for one day and two nights, climbing mountains and wading through water, cold and hungry, and marching continuously. When climbing the mountain, everyone was very tired. Communist Party member Zhu Guohua carried a heavy machine gun and a rifle and said to everyone from beginning to end: "Are you tired? I'll carry the gun for you!" No one asked him to help carry the gun; so he ran to the top of the mountain and shouted: "Comrades, compare hardships!" This kind of evaluation movement enabled the troops to successfully complete the marching and combat tasks.
    Zhang Yumin of the Second Machine Gun Company of a certain unit wrote a poem after realizing the importance of highly mobile field operations: "Field army can do field operations, fighting all over the southeast, northwest: not afraid of long distances, not afraid of dangers; for the sake of the people's liberation, for the sake of eliminating all the Fu bandits. Mobile tactics are really good, fighting everywhere is really enjoyable: when his troops concentrate, our troops disperse; when his main force is transferred to the east, the western city is finished; when the main force is transferred to the north, the south is disrupted; pulling back and forth, the soldiers are too tired to work, if this side is not wiped out, the other side will be annihilated!"
    In highly mobile warfare, after the troops solved the ideological problem of "fighting wherever they are pointed," everyone united and helped each other, overcame many difficulties, and produced many admirable heroic figures. When a certain unit passed through Sishiliyu, Yuxian County, they set off at four in the morning and walked until dawn the next day. The road was full of stones and they climbed several mountains. Everyone had not seen water or food for twenty-four hours. Under such difficulties, Communist Party members and cadres played an exemplary role. Everyone helped each other and showed class love. Some people carried three guns, three rice bags, and three leather bags, and also took in those who had fallen behind. Usually at this time, the troops themselves launched a "battle of offense and defense": one side was grabbing the guns and backpacks of the tired, while the tired refused to let others carry their guns and backpacks. The soldiers called this "defending the position." Soldier Fan Dato of a certain unit had very swollen feet and had difficulty walking during a march. The medical orderly mobilized a donkey for him, but he refused to ride it, only putting his backpack on the donkey and walking himself. Someone shouted: "Communist Party members should not be afraid of any hardships!" At that time, Fan Dato was not a Party member, but he pulled the backpack from the donkey and said, "My feet won't fall off, so I won't fall behind! I want to learn from the Party members." Once, a certain unit marched urgently from Huairou and Miyun to Shixia, walking 105 li in one day. When they were about to arrive, soldier Wang Kunshan (from Shulu, a liberated peasant who had worked long hours for seven years) fainted. After waking up, Deputy Squad Leader Li Runtian said to him, "Let someone else change you to carry the shells!" Wang Kunshan refused and continued to insist on marching. The deputy squad leader told him, "Eat a handful of raw millet to hold on!" Wang Kunshan said, "How can a Party member lead the masses if he can't endure this little bit of hardship!" How can such a tenacious and enlightened army not win battles? This is why the People's Liberation Army led by the Communist Party is able to overcome all difficulties and be invincible!

    万里征战长城线

  （四）高度机动作战
    傅作义摆了个一字长蛇阵，但其兵力不足，战术上不得不加强工事，采取所谓“以主力对主力”、“以集中对集中”的核桃战术。我们这支部队当时的任务，是箝制并歼灭敌人，配合友军休整、作战。为了打破敌人的战术，我们必须实行敌集中我分散，敌分散我集中；敌突然分散，我突然集中；敌突然集中，我突然分散的高度机动作战，使敌人没事干，我有事干。
    部队第一次离开本区远征，而又实行高度机动机战，在思想上首先遇到了两个大困难：第一是野战化问题；第二是艰苦问题。许多战士甚至一些干部带有保守的家庭观念、地域观念，总想回本区；而在困难环境下，有少数人就说怪话，怕爬山走路。
    部队中对这两个问题曾进行了反复的教育，有的部队采取了战士教育战士，群众教育群众的教育方法，进行了“倒苦”、“比苦”、“献思想”、“挖思想”、“说形势爱历史（自己的革命历史）”等群众路线的教育方法。某部进行了“三比四比”运动，即干部三比为：比决心、比进步、比成绩；战士四比为：比艰苦、比技术、比纪律、比勇敢。这是三查诉苦新式练兵运动后发动群众新英雄主义的方法，对解决这两个思想问题起了相当大的作用。在行军时如有人拉距离，一听见别人喊：“比艰苦呀！”后边的人便自觉的跟上去，因为战士都有自尊心，总感到别人能跟，我也能跟上。某次过平古路，某部担任破击警戒的任务，在九十二个钟头内走了四百一十三里路（包括休息吃饭在内），其中坟庄到永宁二百三十里，走了一天两晚上，爬山涉水，寒冷饥饿，连续行军。在上山时大家都很疲劳，党员朱国华扛着重机枪和一支步枪从头到尾向每一个人说：“你累吗？我给扛枪吧！”没人叫他帮助扛枪；于是他又跑到山头上喊：“同志们，比艰苦呀！”这种评比运动，使部队顺利的完成了行军作战任务。
    某部机枪二连张玉民，在认识了高度野战化的重要后写了一首诗：“野战军能野战，东南西北打个遍：不怕走远路，不怕有艰险；为的百姓得解放，为的把傅匪消灭完。机动战术真正好，到处打的真痛快：他的兵力来集中，咱们部队就分散；他的主力往东调，西边城市就完蛋；主力往北调，南边被打乱；两头来回拉，当兵的疲劳不能干，这边不覆没，那边就被歼！”
    在高度机动作战中，部队解决了“指到哪打到哪”的思想问题之后，大家团结互助，战胜了许多困难，出现不少使人钦敬的英雄人物。某部通过蔚县四十里峪时，从早晨四时出发，走到第二天黎明，一路尽是石子，还翻了几个山，大家已经二十四小时不见水和饭，在这样的困难下，共产党员和干部起模范作用，大家互助展开阶级友爱，有的人背三支枪、三个米袋、三个皮包，还收容掉队的。通常在这时候，部队本身展开“攻防战”：一边是抢背疲劳者的枪和背包，而疲劳者却不肯叫别人背自己的枪和背包，战士们叫这为“坚守阵地”。某部战士范大多在一次行军中，脚肿得很大，走路极困难，卫生员给他动员毛驴，他不肯骑，只把背包放在驴身上自己走。不知谁在喊：“共产党员要不怕任何艰苦！”当时范大多不是党员，但一把从驴背上拉下背包来说“我的脚掉不了，我就掉不了队！我要向党员看齐。”一次，某部从怀柔、密云之间急行军转往石匣，一天走了一百零五里，快到的时候，战士王昆山（束鹿人，翻身农民，扛过七年长活）晕倒了，醒来后副班长李润田对他说：“让别人换换你背炮弹吧！”王昆山不肯，继续坚持行军。副班长告诉他：“你吃把生小米顶一顶吧！”王昆山说：“党员这点苦吃不了怎么带领群众呢！”这样顽强而觉悟的部队，怎么能不打胜仗呢？这就是为什么共产党领导的人民解放军，能够攻无不克，所向无敌！
