　　Taihang Launches an Enlistment Wave
　　Eight Thousand Young Men Join the Battlefield
　　[Taihang News] The District Party Committee Office reports: Encouraged by the victorious situation of "fundamentally overthrowing the Kuomintang reactionary government in about a year," the people of the entire district have launched an enthusiastic enlistment movement, loudly shouting: "Overthrow Chiang Kai-shek, liberate all of China!" Starting from the 5th of this month, for nearly a week, in the fifteen counties of the First, Third, Fifth, and Sixth Sub-districts, more than eight thousand young men have voluntarily signed up to join the People's Liberation Army. Party members take the lead, and glorious examples of parents sending their sons and wives sending their husbands are endless.
　　After full and repeated current affairs propaganda in Huguan, a mass-based conscious enlistment movement of "comparing awareness and looking at progress" and "striving to be glorious on the front line" has truly formed. Within three days, 1,200 people in the county had signed up to join the army, far exceeding the task. In the Sixth District's cadre expansion meeting, 49 party member cadres voluntarily joined the army. At the cadre expansion meeting in the Third District, 25 party members led 319 elite soldiers, joining the army empty-handed. Xiang Youze, the secretary of the Shili Village branch, Xiang Baosheng, a member of the branch committee, and the militia instructor and twenty-five party members from the village all joined the army together. When Lu Hai's mother from Hekou Village sent her son to join the army, she said: "We will win in about a year. It is glorious for both you and me that you signed up."
　　Changzhi began on the 5th and ended on the 10th, and successfully completed the task of recruiting 1,400 elite soldiers in five days. Wang Fengming, the director of the Armed Forces Committee of Xiahao Village, took the lead and led seventeen young militiamen to join the army together. They said: "If we don't overthrow Old Chiang, we can't dig up the roots." Two heroines, Song Caifeng and Han Xiaonv, sent their husbands to join the army. The director of the Beitianhe Armed Forces Committee signed up to join the army and said: "Steel must be used on the blade. We will win in a year, and victory will have a share, adding glory to glory."
　　Five hundred young men in Shahe voluntarily signed up, and the enlistment movement is about to be successfully completed.
　　The enlistment movement in Lin County began by conducting in-depth mobilization among party branches and the masses. After party rectification, the class consciousness of party members in the Dongtao Village branch was unprecedentedly enhanced. Responding to the party's call, seven party members signed up to join the army. As of the 14th, more than 2,500 sons and daughters of the people in the county had signed up to join the army.
　　At the conclusion of the district and village cadre expansion meeting in Yuanshi on the 10th, 44 people from the Chengguan District signed up that day. Yang Lao San and Yang Lao Si, two brothers, argued endlessly and joined the army together. An old man named Bao Fuwen sent his son to join the army and said: "I have endured feudal exploitation for decades, without food or clothing, and it was really difficult to raise you (referring to the sons). Since liberation, our family has turned over and has food and clothing. There are no difficulties at home. After joining the army, you must work hard." A fifty-year-old man from Yifan River competed to sign up, saying: "Although I am old, I can drive carts and feed livestock! We must strive for a share in the victory that will come in a year." The Sixth District was even more enthusiastic, completing sixty people in one day. The militia instructor of Dabaizhuang said at the village's farewell meeting: "I will not be content unless I dig up the old roots, and I will not go home unless I overthrow the old thief." After in-depth mobilization inside and outside the party, the county completed more than 400 people in three days.
　　Three hundred and ten demobilized soldiers in She County are returning to the battlefield.
　　Eight hundred young men in Pingshun joined the People's Liberation Army.
　　The enthusiastic enlistment movement has spread throughout the district, and the glorious enlistment task of the Taihang people is about to be successfully completed.
