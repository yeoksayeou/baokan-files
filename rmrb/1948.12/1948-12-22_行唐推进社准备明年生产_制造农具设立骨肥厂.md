[North Yue News] The Xingtang County Production Promotion Cooperative is actively preparing farm tools, fertilizers, and cotton seeds to prepare for next year's large-scale production. In terms of farm tools, the carpentry factory, which is invested and managed by the cooperative, specializes in manufacturing various farm tools. Since its opening two months ago, the finished products have been in short supply. In order to enable all of the county's more than 800 waterwheels without buckets or with missing buckets to be fully utilized next year, 10,000 buckets have been ordered from various carpentry factories using grain loans, which will be completed before the lunar New Year, ready to be loaned or sold to the masses. In terms of fertilizer: A bone fertilizer factory was opened this autumn, producing more than 11,000 jin of fertilizer (equivalent to 1.6 yuan in new currency per jin). The current plan is to collect 30,000 jin of bones, and several thousand jin have already been collected. In addition, 100,000 jin of sesame cakes from oil presses have been ordered using grain loans, and 24,000 jin have already been purchased. These are all prepared for sale or loan next year. In terms of cotton seeds: It is estimated that the county can plant 60,000 mu of cotton next year (30,000 mu this year), requiring 360,000 jin of seeds. On the one hand, the masses are being mobilized to exchange cotton seeds themselves, and on the other hand, good seed cotton is being purchased in Zhao County. After ginning, the cotton seeds are retained for sale or loan to the masses next year. The plan is to purchase 30,000 jin, which can solve the seed problem for 5,000 mu. 16,000 jin have already been purchased. (Zang Chengyao)

(It is very necessary for the Xingtang Promotion Cooperative to actively prepare farm tools, fertilizers, and cotton seeds for next year's large-scale production. However, in addition to the Promotion Cooperative's own preparations, it should also actively help the masses prepare, in order to be vigilant and prevent the cadre's relief mentality and the masses' dependence. - Editor's Note)

　　行唐推进社准备明年生产
    制造农具设立骨肥厂
    【北岳讯】行唐县生产推进社积极准备农具、肥料、棉籽，为明年大生产作好准备工作。在农具方面，经投资经营的木工厂，专门制造各种农具，自开设两个月来，成品供不应求。为使全县八百余架无斗子和缺少斗子的水车，明年能全部使用起来，用贷粮向各木工厂订购斗子一万个，阴历年前即可完成，以备贷给或卖给群众。在肥料方面：今秋开设骨肥厂一座，制肥一万一千余斤（每斤合新币一元六毛），现计划收骨头三万斤，已收到数千斤。又用贷粮定购油房麻饼十万斤，现已购到二万四千斤。这些都准备明年出卖或出贷。在棉籽方面：估计明年全县可植棉六万亩（今年三万亩），需用籽卅六万斤。现在一方面动员群众自己调换棉籽，一方面到赵县购买好籽棉，轧花后留下棉籽以备明年卖给或贷给群众。计划购三万斤，可解决五千亩的籽种。现已购到一万六千斤。（臧成耀）
    （行唐推进社积极准备农具、肥料、棉籽，为明年大生产作准备，这是很必要的。但除了推进社本身准备外，更应积极帮助群众准备，以警惕与防止干部救济观点，和群众的依赖思想。编者按）
