　　North China Bank Seeks Opinions from All Parties to Inspect Work and Launch a Struggle Against Bureaucracy
    Shijiazhuang Branch Responds to the Call and Seriously Conducts Inspection
    [Reported by this newspaper] The North China Bank is actively carrying out a movement against bureaucracy. In September and October, the bank's head office conducted individual visits and held symposiums with various state-owned enterprises to solicit their requirements and opinions regarding the bank. At the same time, a preliminary internal inspection was carried out, revealing serious bureaucratic tendencies in its work style. These were mainly manifested in a failure to deeply understand the actual working conditions of subordinate branches and offices, busying themselves only with drafting orders, issuing instructions, and demanding summary reports and statistical materials from below, with little consideration for the actual difficulties of lower-level cadres, and even less concrete guidance and assistance for them. For example, the head office personally sent three cadres to inspect a branch, and after writing the inspection report, it was left on the desk for three months without being processed; the gold treasury system that lower-level branches and offices were required to implement starting on October 1st was only issued in late September. When assigning tasks to cadres within the head office or at various levels of branches and offices, the necessary conditions for completing the task were generally not sufficiently considered. Requests from lower levels were not answered promptly. Internal division of labor and coordination were not in line with scientific management. A single official document would go back and forth between various sections and departments several times, sometimes taking days to resolve. The same was true when people from lower-level branches and offices came to negotiate; a matter would involve many complications, while guests were treated coldly and inhospitably. For example, when the Xinji branch sent × carts of silver dollars, no one at the head office helped unload them. The comrades who had escorted the carts from a long distance had to carry the boxes one by one into the warehouse until 11:30 at night, exhausted and hungry, but still without any hospitality. They had to go to the kitchen themselves to eat a few bowls of cold rice. Concurrent with the head office's self-criticism, the Shijiazhuang branch also discovered bureaucratic practices during its own self-criticism and consultation of opinions. More than 40 suggestions were put forward by various units. The head office believes that this kind of work style is extremely common in branches and offices at all levels, differing only in its manifestations and degree.
    In order to improve work style, develop business, and educate and train cadres, the head office instructed that a movement to overcome bureaucratization and oppose bureaucracy should be launched throughout the bank, with criticism and self-criticism, and made specific regulations:
    1. After receiving the instructions, responsible cadres at all levels of branches, offices, and stations should personally preside over detailed study and discussion, and mobilize and organize all comrades to conduct self-criticism.
    2. Widely adopt the methods of individual visits and holding symposiums to solicit criticisms and opinions from various state-owned enterprises, government organs, and people from all walks of life.
    3. The leaders of branches, offices, and stations at all levels should humbly study various opinions and criticisms and correct shortcomings.
    At the same time, according to the needs and requirements of all parties, as well as the current conditions of cadres and the foundation of work, they should be determined to strive to overcome various shortcomings in systems and work styles, and realistically formulate concrete improvement measures, which should be immediately announced and implemented.
    4. All branches, offices, and stations must report their self-criticism, feedback from all parties, specific improvement measures, and the date of improvement to their superior branches and offices. The leaders of each branch should regard the movement to quickly overcome bureaucracy as one of the central links in promoting work and developing business. (Zeng Wenjing)
    [Another report] The Shijiazhuang branch of the North China Bank, in response to the call of the head office, has formulated various specific measures to overcome bureaucracy and bureaucratic work styles, so as to improve work and develop business. The measures are divided into eleven items, the specific content of which is as follows: Regarding business hours, in the past, deposit and loan transactions were not handled outside of business hours, regardless of the circumstances, which delayed the work of some units and affected the bank's business. It is now stipulated that in special circumstances, deposits and loans can be made at any time. To facilitate customers, it has been decided to set up an office on Chaoyang Road to reduce customer travel; to establish business offices in industrial and mining areas (such as Jingxing) or larger stations to facilitate the use of funds by state-owned enterprises. In addition, it is stipulated to increase cashiers and simplify accounting procedures, sort out damaged banknotes and issue exchange methods at any time, summarize deposits and loans on a regular basis, increase mortgage loan business, and expand the area of interbank remittances, so as to facilitate the masses and develop business.

　　华北银行征询各方意见检查工作 　 开展反官僚主义斗争
    石庄分行响应号召认真进行检查
    【本报讯】华北银行正积极开展反对官僚主义运动。九、十月间，银行总行曾向各公营企业进行个别访问及举行座谈会，征求他们对银行的要求及意见，同时并在内部进行初步检查，发现工作上存在着严重的官僚主义作风倾向，主要表现在不深入了解下面各级行、处实际工作情况，光忙于起草命令、发指示、向下面要总结报告、要调查统计材料，很少考虑下级干部的实际困难，更缺乏对他们的具体指导和帮助。如总行亲自派三个干部到一个分行去视察，回来写好了视察报告，却在办公桌上一放三月，没有处理；要下面各级行、处在十月一日开始执行的金库制度，九月下旬才把命令发出。分派总行内干部或各级行、处的任务，对于完成给予任务的一定条件，一般考虑不够。不及时答复下级的请示。内部分工联系，不合科学管理。一件公文在各处科间来回往返数次，有的甚至数日还得不到解决，下级行、处来人交涉时也是如此，一件事几费周折，而对客人则态度冷淡，招待不周，如辛集支行送来×车白洋，总行无人帮助卸车，仍由远途押车来的同志，一箱一箱搬入库房，直到夜间十一点半，疲劳饥饿不堪，仍无人招待，只好自己到厨房吃几碗冷饭。和总行的检讨同时，石家庄分行也在自我检讨及征询意见中发现官僚主义的作风，各单位提出意见有四十余条之多，总行认为此种作风在各级行、处中，带有极大的普遍性，只是表现形式和程度不同。
    为了改善作风、开展业务、教育培养干部，总行指示要在全行开展克服机关化、反对官僚主义的运动，进行批评与自我批评，并作具体规定：
    一、各级行、处、所，在接到指示后，应由负责干部亲自主持，加以详细研究讨论，并动员和组织全体同志进行检讨。
    二、广泛地采取个别访问和召开座谈会的方式，征求各公营企业、机关、各界群众的批评和意见。
    三、各级行、处、所的领导上，应虚心研究各种意见和批评，并改正缺点。
    同时应根据各方面的需要和要求，及目前干部条件，工作基础，决心去努力克服各种制度及作风上的毛病，实事求是地订出具体的改进办法，立即公布执行。
    四、各行、处、所必须将其检讨情况，各方反映，具体改进办法和改进日期，呈报其上级行处。各分行的领导上，应把迅速克服官僚主义的运动，当作推动工作开展业务的中心环节之一。（曾文经）
    【又讯】华北银行石家庄分行响应总行号召，已订出各种具体办法克服官僚主义及机关化作风以改进工作，发展营业。该办法共分十一项，其具体内容：在营业时间上，过去在非营业时间内，对存、放款事务，无论情况如何，均不办理，以致耽误有些单位的工作，影响银行业务，今后规定如有特殊情况，可以随时存、放。在便利顾客方面，决定在朝阳路增设一办事处，以减少顾客的往返；在工矿区（如井陉）或较大车站筹设营业机构，以便利公营企业使用资金。此外又规定增加出纳员及简化会计手续，随时整理破票及印发兑换办法，按期作存、放款总结，增加抵押放款业务，扩大通汇地区等，以便利群众及发展营业。
