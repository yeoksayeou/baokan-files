Xinhua News Agency, North China, 19th. Students and professors from universities in Beiping, Tianjin, and other places have refused the Kuomintang reactionary government's order to move south. This fact left Hu Shih, the reactionary president of Peking University who strongly advocated moving the school, and reactionary professor Wang Yuxiu, to flee to Nanjing alone on the 15th. Students and professors oppose moving south because they have learned from the experience of Jinan, Shenyang, and other places that after the People's Liberation Army enters these large cities, the learning, work, lives, and freedom of the vast majority of them will be guaranteed, except for a very small number of people who resolutely oppose the people with their actions, who should be punished according to the law. According to the Hong Kong Wen Wei Po on November 23rd, the Chiang Kai-shek government telegraphed to various schools in North China at the beginning of last month, ordering them to move south, but it was resolutely opposed by the vast majority of students. Tsinghua University students unanimously resolved to oppose the move south on the 4th of last month. The students pointed out that classes resumed two weeks after the liberation of Jinan, which shows that not moving the school does not affect studies. On the contrary, if the school moves, it will fall into the miserable situation of exile. According to Tianjin newspapers, at the Peking University school affairs meeting on the 22nd of last month, because most professors refused to move the school, after "two hours of debate," it was decided that "under no circumstances will we move." This resolution was passed by the professors' meeting on the 24th. On the 26th, the Peking University Student Union convened a temporary representative meeting, and 120 representatives from various departments unanimously formally passed a resolution not to move the school, and at the same time established the "Peking University Student Life Mutual Aid Association" as an "emergency organization" to unite and help each other maintain life during the war. The students also decided to contact the school's professors to participate in this organization. The vast majority of students in various schools in Tianjin also refused to move south. According to the Hong Kong Ta Kung Pao of the Kuomintang political science system on the 13th of last month, they have no intention of leaving at all. They said, "This time is not like the War of Resistance. We must figure out why we are fleeing and who we are fleeing with."

　　蒋匪胁骗阴谋破产  平津各校拒绝南迁
    学生从济南沈阳的解放获得了经验
    【新华社华北十九日电】北平天津等地各大学学生及教授已拒绝国民党反动政府的南迁命令。这个事实使得力主迁校的北京大学反动校长胡适及反动教授王聿修在十五日孤孤单单地逃到南京。学生们和教授们反对南迁，因为他们已经从济南、沈阳等地的经验知道，在解放军进入这些大城市之后，除了极少数坚决以行动反对人民的分子应当依法惩处以外，他们中间绝大多数人的学习、工作、生活和自由都会得到保障。据上月二十三日香港文汇报称；蒋介石政府曾于上月初电令华北各校南迁，但遭到绝大多数学生的坚决反对。清华大学学生已于上月四日一致决议反对南迁。学生们指出：济南解放后两周即复课，足见不迁校求学并无影响，反之，如果迁校，则将陷于流亡生活的惨境。另据天津报纸披露：上月二十二日北大校务会议中，由于大多数教授拒绝迁校，经“两小时辩论”之后，已决定“在任何情形之下决不搬迁”。此项决议复经二十四日教授会通过。二十六日北大学生自治会召集了临时代表会，各系科代表一百二十人在会上一致正式通过不迁校的决议，同时成立“北大学生生活互助会”，作为战争期间团结互助维持生活之“应变机构”。学生们并决定联络该校教授参加此一组织。天津各校的绝大多数学生，也拒绝迁校。据国民党政学系的香港大公报上月十三日载称：他们半点走的意思都没有。他们说：“这次不比抗战，我们总得弄清为什么逃、跟谁逃的道理。”
