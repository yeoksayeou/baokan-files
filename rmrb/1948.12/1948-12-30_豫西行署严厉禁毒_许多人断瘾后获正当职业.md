　　Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 27th: In order to eliminate the persecution of the people of Henan by the Kuomintang's drug policy, the Yuxi Administrative Office issued a drug prohibition order in September. Over the past three months, the work of prohibiting the cultivation and smoking of opium has achieved initial results. The Luoyang Seventh District Government, in order to ban opium cultivation, organized anti-smoking teams and carried out propaganda everywhere. A mass meeting was held in Fengli Town, punishing twelve households who repeatedly refused to repent, ordering them to eradicate 3,000 mu of opium and replant wheat. The village chief of Santun Village in Yiyang County was removed from his post by the peasants for failing to comply with the law to eradicate the opium he had planted and was handed over to the People's Government for handling. The Cai Village District of Yichuan County held a meeting of 2,000 people, demanding that those who planted opium reflect in public, influencing farmers in two nearby districts to voluntarily eradicate all the opium they had planted and replant wheat or other crops. Yu County successively arrested major drug dealers and bandits such as Tu Jinpei. Luoyang also captured the famous drug offender Liang Yuntong and sentenced him to five years in prison. The number of drug dealers in these two places has now been greatly reduced. The Luoyang Municipal People's Government, in order to actively save drug addicts, universally held symposiums for the families of drug addicts and conducted individual education for drug addicts. It also successively established five drug rehabilitation centers for free treatment. As of the end of November, more than 60 people had broken their addictions, returned home, and engaged in legitimate occupations. In the past, the people of the Yuxi region suffered deeply from the Kuomintang's drug policy. Before liberation, Liu Maoen, the chairman of the puppet Henan Provincial Government, and the Kuomintang special agent agency, the Zhengzhou puppet "剿匪" (bandit suppression) headquarters' second division, specialized in manufacturing heroin and other drugs in Kaifeng, Zhengzhou, and other places, poisoning the people and plundering their wealth. According to a survey in Yu County, about a quarter of the shops, stalls, and households in the city smoked opium, heroin, and other drugs before liberation. Before liberation, there were more than 300 drug dealers and more than 4,000 opium smokers in Luoyang. The area in front of the former Luoyang Prefectural Office and Fayuan Street was the most severely affected by opium, as it was where more than ten Kuomintang puppet prefectural and county government offices were concentrated, and many puppet officials and yamen runners lived there. Among the 52 poor households in Si Lu, more than one-third were impoverished by smoking drugs.

　　豫西行署严厉禁毒
  　许多人断瘾后获正当职业
    【新华社中原二十七日电】为了肃清国民党毒化河南人民的迫害，豫西行署于九月间颁布禁毒命令，三个月来禁种、禁吸雅片的工作，已得到了初步成绩。洛阳七区政府为取缔种植鸦片，曾组织禁烟小组，四出宣传。在丰礼镇召开群众大会，惩罚了十二户屡教不悔分子并令其将三千亩鸦片铲除，改种上小麦。伊阳三屯村长因所种鸦片不遵守法令铲除被农民罢免，并被送交人民政府法办。伊川县蔡庄区召开二千人大会，要种鸦片者当众反省，影响附近两个区的农民自动将所种鸦片全部铲除，改种上小麦或其他庄稼。禹县先后逮捕了大毒贩土匪屠金培等。洛阳亦捕获了著名毒犯梁运通，并判处他以徒刑五年。现该两地贩卖毒品者已大为减少。洛阳市人民政府为积极拯救中毒者，曾普遍召开吸毒者家属座谈会，并对吸毒者进行个别教育。又先后设立了五个戒烟所免费治疗，截至十一月底，断瘾回家从事正当职业者已达六十余人。豫西地区人民过去受国民党毒化政策毒害很深。解放前，伪河南省政府主席刘茂恩和国民党特务机关郑州伪“剿匪”指挥部第二处等，即在开封、郑州等地专门制造海洛英等毒品，毒害人民，掠夺人民财富。据禹县城内调查，解放前各商铺、摊贩、民户吸食鸦片海洛英等毒品的约占四分之一。洛阳在解放前贩卖毒品的就有三百余家，吸鸦片者有四千余人。洛阳原专署前街、法院街一带，因集中了国民党伪专署县府等十余机关，伪官吏衙役多聚居于此，胡这一带居民受烟毒害也最深。四闾五十二户贫民中，为吸烟毒弄穷者占三分之一以上。
