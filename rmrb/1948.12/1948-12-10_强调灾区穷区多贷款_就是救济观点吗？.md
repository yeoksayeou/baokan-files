　　Emphasizing More Loans for Disaster Areas and Poor Areas - Is That a Relief Mentality?
　　Editor Meng Jie Fu:
　　After reading the report "The Taihang Branch of the North China Bank Holds a Meeting to Correct the Direction of Loan Work" on the first page of the People's Daily, No. 144, I have a few opinions to raise for everyone's consideration: I completely agree with the criticism of the "relief mentality" in the review of "Concentrating on Supporting Production and Opposing Alms and Relief," but I think that "emphasizing more loans for disaster areas and poor areas" does not necessarily equal a "relief mentality," as exemplified in the report. Because: First, whether a loan is a "relief mentality" should mainly depend on whether it is used to support and organize mass production. If it is used for production, it is clearly not a "relief mentality." If it is not used for production, then it is not only a question of disaster areas and poor areas; even in non-disaster and non-poor areas, wouldn't it also be a relief mentality? Therefore, the relief mentality should not be determined by whether it is a "disaster area" or "poor area." Second, "the amount and timing of loans should generally be based on the difficulties and needs of producers," as stipulated in the instructions of the North China People's Government on winter loan work. Aren't disaster areas and poor areas precisely the "difficulties and needs of producers"? (Of course, not a general "disaster area and poor area," but also specific distinctions between certain households and certain individuals.) If we vigorously use loans to support and organize their production, aren't we doing the right thing? At the same time, in the examples used in the original report to criticize the "relief mentality," the error of "some cadres advocating universal care" was also criticized. However, if we don't "lend more" in disaster areas and poor areas, wouldn't that be making the mistake of universal care? If we say that not lending more in disaster areas and poor areas does not constitute "universal care," then we can only lend more in non-disaster and non-poor areas, but wouldn't that be violating the principle of not taking care of the "difficulties and needs of producers"? Wouldn't that be even more wrong?
　　I feel that this is a policy issue, so I am raising it. At the same time, in our county's agricultural loans this year, we primarily focused on supporting and organizing the production of the masses in poor areas and poor villages. Later, when there was a flood, we again focused on supporting and organizing the production of the masses in disaster areas and disaster villages. Therefore, I believe that the report in this article needs to be re-examined.
　　Editor's Note: Comrade Meng Jie Fu's opinion is very good and deserves the attention and study of all localities. We also hope that the Taihang Branch of the North China Bank will express its views.

### 强调灾区穷区多贷款　就是救济观点吗？

　　强调灾区穷区多贷款
  　就是救济观点吗？
    孟介夫编辑同志：
    人民日报第一四四号、第一版“华北银行太行分行召开会议扭正贷款工作方向”的报道，我看了后有几点意见，提出来请大家研究：对检讨“集中扶植生产反对恩赐救济”中，我完全同意“批判………救济观点”只是在其举例中说：“如有的干部………强调灾区穷区多贷”。我认为“救济观点”确是错误，但“强调灾区穷区多贷”并不一定就等于“经济观点”。因为：第一、贷款是否“救济观点”，主要应看他是否用之于扶植与组织群众生产上。如果他是忙于生产，显然就不是什么“救济观点”；如果不是用于生产，那末就不仅是在灾区穷区的问题了，即便是在非灾区非穷区不也就是救济观点了吗？因此，救济观点不应决定于“灾区穷区”与否。第二、“贷款之多少先后一般根据生产者的困难与需要”，这是华北人民政府关于冬季贷款工作指示中规定的。而灾区与穷区不正是“生产者困难与需要吗”？（当然不是笼统的“灾区穷区”，而还要具体区分一定户一定人的）如果大力用贷款扶植与组织他们生产，不正是作对了吗？同时，在原报导中批判“救济观点”的举例中，也曾批判了“有的干部主张普遍照顾”的错误，可是，不在灾区穷区“多贷”，那不就正是犯了普遍照顾的错误吗？如果说不在灾区穷区多贷也不犯“普遍照顾”的错误，那就只有在非灾区与非穷区多贷了，可是那不又犯了不照顾“生产者的困难与需要”的原则了吗？不更是错误吗？
    我感觉这是属于政策上的一个问题，所以提出来，同时我县在今年的农贷中，也曾经是主要的放在扶植与组织穷区穷村群众的生产，后来闹了水灾，又曾经是主要的放在扶植与组织灾区灾村的群众生产。因此我认为该文的报导，有重新研究的必要。
  编者按：孟介夫同志这个意见很好，值得各地注意研究，并希望华北银行太行分行表示意见。
