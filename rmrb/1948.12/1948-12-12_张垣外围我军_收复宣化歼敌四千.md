    Xinhua News Agency, Ping-Sui Front, 9th. A unit of the People's Liberation Army recaptured the famous industrial city of Xuanhua on the Ping-Zhang section of the Ping-Sui Railway on the 7th. The enemy division defending the city was mostly annihilated. The People's Liberation Army launched an offensive against the outskirts of Zhangjiakou on November 29th. After successively recovering strongholds such as Jiuwanquan, Huaian, and Chaigoubao, the enemy's 27th Division directly under the North China "Bandit Suppression Headquarters" (originally the 31st Provisional Division of the New 2nd Army), fearing annihilation, abandoned the city and fled on the evening of the 6th. They had just fled to Shalingzi and Yulinbao, about 30 miles southeast of Zhangjiakou, when they were surrounded by the People's Liberation Army. By 12:00 noon on the 7th, most of them had been eliminated, with over 4,000 enemy troops killed, wounded, or captured. Xuanhua city was immediately recovered by our forces. Xuanhua is a heavy industrial area in North China, with the Longyan Iron Mine in Yandunshan in the northeast, the Jimingshan Coal Mine in the southeast, and the Xiahuayuan Power Plant. Xuanhua city was liberated from the hands of the Japanese puppet regime by the People's Liberation Army in September 1945, and the Chahar Democratic Provincial Government was established there. It was occupied by the bandit troops of Fu Zuoyi on October 10, 1946.
    [Ji-Lu-Yu Telegram] Under the influence of the active mopping-up operations and political offensives carried out by the local armed forces of our Ji-Lu-Yu Third Military Region, two more groups of remnant puppet bandits surrendered to our forces with their weapons. On November 14th, after our Dangshan Brigade mopped up six scattered bandits near the city, the puppet Dangshan Independent 2nd Company dared not remain in hiding and surrendered with all their weapons. On November 15th, when the puppet Heze Security Brigade was being encircled and annihilated by a certain unit of our forces at Xiayangzhuang, more than ten miles northwest of Xuzhou, 42 enemy soldiers surrendered with their weapons under the pressure of our offensive. In total, they brought with them three machine guns, over sixty rifles, two pistols, and over three thousand rounds of ammunition. Furthermore, a certain unit of our Seventh Military Region's local armed forces cooperated with the main forces in combat, continuously mopping up bandits from November 11th to 15th. In five days, they captured a total of 96 enemy troops, wounded 7, killed 1, and seized three light machine guns, 77 rifles and pistols, 3,204 rounds of ammunition, and 11 war horses, as well as 27 large carts of cotton military uniforms. We suffered no casualties in the above continuous battles.
