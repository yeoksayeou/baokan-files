　　[Jizhong Electric] To effectively complete the task of supporting the front and ensure the complete victory of the Peiping-Tianjin Campaign, Party, government, military, and civilians at all levels in Jizhong have been mobilized in earnest. Jizhong has established a unified front logistics command for the Peiping-Tianjin Campaign, responsible for leading the entire region's work to support the front. In addition, 1,566 capable cadres have been drawn from Jizhong's various agencies, Party schools, and special commissioner's offices and counties to work at the front. Various departments have also made precise divisions of labor. For example, the Armed Forces Department, Civil Affairs Office, and various mass organizations are responsible for all wartime mobilization work. The financial and economic departments and the troops' supply department are responsible for supply work. The Propaganda Department of the District Party Committee, the Education Department of the Administrative Office, the Political Department, and the Jizhong Daobao are responsible for organization and propaganda work. The Liaison Department of the Military Region and the Public Security Bureau are responsible for handling prisoners of war. The Transportation Department of the Administrative Office and other departments are responsible for transportation work. The Health Department and Health Bureau are responsible for wartime health work, and have now begun operations. In addition, in order to unify forces, the Administrative Office has established a joint office by various directly affiliated departments, specifically responsible for supporting the front. The economic department is responsible for controlling wartime prices, the supply of non-staple foods, and military exchange. The Transportation Department is in charge of repairing roads and building bridges. The Armed Forces Department of the Military Region, except for one cadre in each section, all others have gone to the front, and the cadres are in high spirits. Even comrades who are weak or sick are setting out with their illnesses. The Jizhong Administrative Office issued an order on the 16th to transfer more than 300 section chiefs, finance and grain accountants, and other cadres from special districts and counties to be assigned to various general and branch stations for supply work. They are also preparing a group of cadres to manage the supply of non-staple foods. The bank has drawn out 137 people to be responsible for military exchange. The Transportation Department and the Finance Department have sent people down to inspect the repair of roads and the construction of bridges. The transportation company is also actively repairing cars, preparing for transportation, and plans to have all large vehicles participate in supporting the front. The Health Department and the Health Bureau have drawn personnel from seven branch hospitals and gathered them in a certain place for training, ready to go to the front as soon as the war begins. Many cadres are working tirelessly to support the front. Many cadres in Lixian are so busy that they eat only one meal a day. The Tenth District Party School, the Public Security Training Class, the Teachers Training Class, and other schools have drawn out 165 people to form two work groups to participate in supporting the front. They also proposed: "No leave, no going home, obey orders, work actively, and complete the task of liberating Peiping-Tianjin and liberating all of North China."
