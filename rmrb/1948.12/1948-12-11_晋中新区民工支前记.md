    Record of Civilian Labor Support in the New Jinzhong District
    Yan Xishan's bloody hands have enraged the hearts of the masses.
    Yan Xishan's bloody hands have enraged the hearts of the broad masses in the Jinzhong area. Everywhere, one can hear the New District civilian laborers denouncing Yan Xishan's crimes. Wang Peiren (middle peasant), a civilian laborer from Wangqiao Village in Qi County, recounted how in 1946, Yan Xishan demanded grain taxes. He handed over all seven sacks of grain he had managed to harvest, but it still wasn't enough, and he had to sell fifteen mu of land to clear the debt. With no grain left at home, he went to stay with his sister. Unexpectedly, after only three days, the village's civil defense platoon leader came to check the household registration, claiming he was in disguise, and tied him up and beat him. He was then sent to the regiment headquarters, forced into military training; being beaten and abused in the company wasn't enough, they didn't even give him enough to eat. Han Liu'er from Donglu Village in Taigu was seized by Yan Xishan and had his ears pierced with iron wire for being the brother of a former militiaman. He was paraded through the streets and beaten to death with clubs. Zhang Shumei from Xiazhuang became a regular soldier but deserted because he couldn't endure the hardship. Yan Xishan constantly searched for him at his home, eventually driving his father to hang himself. In one civilian labor camp in Taigu, at a grievance meeting of three hundred people, more than thirty households had been severely beaten by Yan Xishan. Huo Youfu from Zhaobi Village in Pingyao Fifth District said, "In 1946, my mother was killed by Yan Xishan's artillery shell, and my mule was also snatched away. On the twenty-seventh day of the twelfth lunar month that year, all the grain in my house was looted clean. I had no way to celebrate the New Year, so I sold a large urn and bought two dou of sorghum, but that was also taken away. My wife couldn't bear it any longer and, pregnant, went to plead with them (Yan Xishan's army). The enemy kicked her in the stomach, causing her to jump into a well."
  Resolutely and courageously complete the support tasks.
    "The faster the shells are transported up, the sooner the old gray ghost (referring to Yan Xishan) will die," said Wang Zhenlu, a fifty-year-old from the Sixth Company of the Second Brigade of Qi County, while rushing to transport shells. Wang Xianyu from the Fourth Company of the Second Brigade of Qi County, refused to come down even when his face was grazed by a bullet while rushing to transport the wounded. When others advised him to come down and apply some medicine, he said, "This is nothing! I can't come down until I've completed the task." Yan Guangcai and Wang Jun from the Fifth Group of the First Platoon, upon seeing a signal flare ahead, immediately wanted to rush forward to rescue the wounded. The troops told them, "Wait until the gunfire is less intense." But they didn't listen and rolled forward to rescue the wounded. During a transport mission in a certain battle, the Eighth Company originally had six stretchers, three of which were destroyed by artillery shells. At that time, the civilian labor group leader Wu Lianyuan encouraged everyone to continue forward, and as a result, three stretchers completed the task of six. On November 7th, the weather was very cold, and they had to transport artillery shells. Wu Jun didn't have cotton-padded trousers, and others advised him not to go, but he said, "I won't be cold once I carry the shells." Lü Zhixin from the Fourth Company, for the sake of completing the task, ignored the pain from the sores on his legs and made six trips in a row. Liu Quande from the Second Squad of the Fourth Brigade of Jiexiu had blisters on his shoulder from carrying shells, but he still refused to rest. On October 8th, when the Fourth Company of the Second Brigade of Qi County delivered shells to the front line, the troops had just moved when they reached the designated location, and the enemy discovered them and fired wildly. The company commander encouraged everyone, saying, "Don't be afraid, the enemy is surrounded on all sides, just hide well and it will be fine." When they continued to advance to find the troops, the enemy fired at them again. They advanced while concealing themselves, finally completing the task. On November 10th, when the First Brigade was transporting ammunition, the original plan was for two people to carry a box of shells, but the Sixth Company had each person carry a box, completing four days' worth of tasks in two days.
  Unite and love each other, overcome difficulties.
    The civilian laborers of the Ninth Company of Fenyang lived in a very cold room, and everyone was restless from the cold. Cook Li Yingshou, while explaining to everyone, busied himself starting fires and personally made a straw curtain to keep everyone warm. Because the mission was urgent, the civilian laborers of the Sixth Company of the Second Brigade of Qi County spent a day and a half at the front without anything to eat. Quartermaster Wang Shuming became anxious and hurriedly bought several jin of meat from Yuci, cooked a meal, and baked some pancakes, personally taking them to the front with the cook and comforting everyone. On November 3rd, while transporting hand grenades, Pang Siyu sprained his foot, and Jia Bukuan took on the task of both people alone. On the night of October 28th, it was so dark that you couldn't see your hand in front of your face. A comrade fell into a ditch, and Comrade Wu Jun immediately put down his own things, pulled him up, and helped the other comrades over the mountain one by one, successfully completing the task. When the Seventh Company was rescuing the wounded, because the enemy's artillery fire was too dense, a large group of people couldn't go up. Kang Ji'er volunteered to say, "I'll go up alone and snatch them down. You can carry them away when it's safe."
  Overcome the cold, find warmth.
    The weather grew colder day by day, and the troops' offensive penetrated deeper and deeper into the mountains. At this time, the civilian laborers launched a struggle against the cold. The Sixth Company of Qi County arrived at Tianzhuang in the middle of the night, but no matter how they knocked, the villagers wouldn't open their doors. They had no choice but to sleep in the open, three or four people huddled together. When they entered the homes of the villagers the next morning, the villagers ignored them, and there wasn't even a mat on the kang. At this time, not only did everyone not get angry, but platoon leader Duan Shaoli took the lead in fetching a load of water for the villagers, some helped the landlord thresh grain in the yard, and some went to the fields to get water chestnuts. In less than half a day, the moved villagers not only took out mats but also vacated a room and even invited everyone to eat dinner that night. The Ninth Company arrived at Shijiawan, where there were only ten or so households, not enough houses to live in, and they had to fetch water from the mountains. In order to overcome this difficulty, they split up to gather firewood and dig caves, digging thirty cave dwellings and gathering hundreds of pounds of firewood in one day, resolving the difficulties.
  Happily launch a campaign to establish meritorious service.
    When the Fifth Company of Qi County went to a certain place to carry the wounded, the whole company originally had only forty-eight stretchers, but this time they formed fifty-nine. Wang Zonggui, forty-eight years old, said, "We'll have four people carry one stretcher"; Wang Wenlong, twenty-one years old, and two others carried one stretcher. In the Sixth Company, the Fourth Platoon fetched a bundle of firewood each as soon as it was light; the Second Platoon swept the streets clean every day. The company originally had six sick members, but encouraged by everyone's high morale, there are now only four left. Cooks Lü Changjun, Zhang Shilin, and others also wanted to carry stretchers once. On November 24th, when everyone else was asleep, Wang Songlin from the Eighth Company checked the discipline and discovered that a group of civilian laborers from Jiexiu were demanding money, and immediately reported it to the company headquarters. Currently, all participating civilian labor companies have organized discipline inspection teams. The Sixth Company of Qi County has also organized a propaganda team, publicizing the contents of the newspaper to the masses every day. The Eighth Company has established a literacy class, with lessons every day to learn characters. When the Fourth Company was evaluating merits, the First Platoon said that the Fourth Platoon's evaluation was not strict enough, and the members of the Fourth Platoon took out "rescue certificates" and said, "You say the evaluation wasn't strict enough, let's compare who has more rescue certificates."
  We won't go home until Taiyuan is captured.
    Sun Youyu and Sun Erniu, civilian laborers from Shouyang, deserted while delivering materials on October 20th. When they got home, they saw that the autumn harvest had been completed and the grain had been stored in the urns. Seeing that the men and women, old and young, in the village were all busy supporting the front, they were moved and voluntarily returned to the team. Shi Guang, a sixty-year-old carter from Taigu, said, "Yan Xishan's soldiers and farmers are one, he confiscated my land, my son was conscripted into the army, and only my old couple were left at home, starving all spring. This time, I won't vent my anger until Taiyuan is captured." Before the civilian laborers of the Fourth District of Taigu set off, each village signed a contract: "We won't go home until Taiyuan is captured." Shi Yuanzai from Xiaoyi said, "This is my chance to vent my anger. Yan Xishan robbed my wife, and I haven't seen her for three years, not even a word." Liang Yonglong's wife from Beiming in Pingyao wrote in a letter: "The masses helped harvest our autumn crops and brought them home, yielding three shi; the wheat has also been planted. Our Chun Sheng'er is in good health. I hope you take care of yourself, work actively, and come back after the victory."

    晋中新区民工支前记
    阎匪的血手，激怒了群众的心。
    阎匪的血手，激怒了晋中广大人民的心，到处可以听到新区民工对阎匪罪恶的控诉。祁县王乔村民工王培仁（中农），在民国三十五年阎匪讨要粮差，他把仅打的七口袋粮食全交了还不够，又卖了十五亩地才算清。家里没粮吃，便投到姐家，不料住了没三天，那村的民卫排长便去查户口。说他是伪装，绑起来打了他一顿，就送到团部逼着他去当兵受训；到了连里挨打受气还不算，连饭也不叫吃饱。太谷东炉村韩六儿，因他弟弟当过民兵，他便被阎匪捉住用铁丝串上耳朵，游了一趟街，被乱棍打死。下庄张树梅当了常备兵，因自己受不了那种苦而逃跑了。阎匪不断到他家找他，结果逼的他爹上吊而死。太谷一个民工营，在三百人的诉苦会上，就有三十多户被阎匪痛打过，平遥五区赵壁村霍有富说：“民国三十五年，我母亲被阎锡山的炮弹打死，还抢走了我的骡子。那年腊月二十七，又把家里的粮食抢了个干净。我没法过年，便卖了个大瓮换下二斗高粱，但也被抢去。我女人实在忍心不下，怀着胎就跑到人家（阎匪军）面前央求，敌人向她肚上一撞，把我女人气的跳了井。”
  坚决勇敢完成支前任务。
    “炮弹运上去的快，老灰鬼（指阎锡山）早死一天”，这便是祁县二大队六连五十多岁的王祯禄抢运炮弹时说的。祁县二大队四连王献雨，在抢运伤员时，脸上被子弹擦破也不肯下来，别人劝他下去上点药，他说：“这点算什么！我可不能在没完成任务时下去。”一排五组阎广才、王俊，看到前面有了彩号，就想马上前去抢救，部队告他说：“等一下枪弹稀疏时再去。”但他们不听，就打着滚把伤员抢了回来。八连在参加某次战斗运送时，原规定了六付担架，其中三付被炮弹打散了，当时民工组长武连元就鼓动大家继续前进，结果三付担架完成了六付的任务。十一月七日，天气很冷，要去运炮弹，武俊因没棉裤，别人劝他不要去，他说：“扛上炮弹就不冷了”。四连吕智新，为了完成任务，不顾腿上的疮痛，一连运送了六次。介休四大队二中队的刘全德，扛炮弹把肩上压的起了泡，但还不肯休息。祁县二大队四连，于十月八日送炮弹到火线时，刚到了指定地点，部队转移了，敌人发现了他们，就乱打枪；连长鼓动大家说：“不要怕，四面都包围着敌人，只要躲好就不要紧。”当他们继续前进找部队时，敌人又向他们打来，他们边进边隐，终于完成了任务。十一月十日，一大队在运军火时，原规定每两人扛一箱炮弹，但六连每人扛一箱，在二天内完成了四天的任务。
  团结友爱，克服困难。
    汾阳九连民工，住在一间很冷的屋子里，冻得大家坐立不安。炊事员李应守，一面向大家解释，一面忙着给大家按火，并且亲自打了一个草帘，使大家温暖了。祁县二大队六连的民工，因任务紧急，在前方停了一天半夜没吃上东西。司务长王树明就着了急，他急忙从榆次买了几斤肉，作上饭，又烙了几张饼，亲自带伙夫送到前面，并安慰了大家。十一月三日运手榴弹时，庞思玉歪了脚，贾步宽一人就担起了两人的任务。十月二十八日夜里，天黑得伸手不见掌，某同志摔到沟里，武俊同志马上放下自己的东西，把他拉上来，并把别个同志一一扶过山，顺利的完成任务。七连在抢救伤员时，因敌人的炮火过密，大批人不能上去，康吉儿自报奋勇的说：“我一人上前抢下来，平妥了你们再抬着走。”
  战胜寒冷，得到温暖。
    天气一天一天的寒冷，部队的进攻却一天天的深入到山地，就在这时候，民工展开了与寒冷作斗争。祁县六连半夜到了田庄，老百姓的门怎么也叫不开，他们只得三人一团四人一伙的露宿。天明他们一进入民家，老百姓却不理，炕上连席也没有。这时大家不但没发火，而且排长段少理首先给老乡打了一担水，有的给房东上场抬谷子，有的下地去弄玉菱子，这样不到半天，感动的老乡不但拿出了席子，并且又誊出了一间房，晚上还叫大家吃饭。九连到了施家弯，老乡只有十来户，房住不下，吃水还得到山下去取。他们为克服此困难，便分头打柴、打洞，一天内打起了三十个窑洞，打了几百斤柴，解决了困难。
  欢欢喜喜掀起立功挑战。
    祁县五连某次到×地抬伤员时，全连原来只有四十八付担架，这次就组成了五十九付。四十八岁的王宗贵说：“我们四个人抬一付”；二十一岁的王文龙等三个人抬了一付。六连四排天刚亮，每人就打回了一捆柴；二排每天把街上都打扫得干干净净。该连原有病员六个，在大家高度情绪的鼓舞下，现只剩有四人。炊事员吕长俊、张使林等三人，也要去抬一次担架。十一月二十四日，别人都睡了觉，八连王松林去检查纪律，发现了介休一班民工正要钱，当下报告了连部。现各参战民工连，都组织了纪律检查组。祁县六连还组织了一个宣传组。每日照报纸内容向群众宣传。八连成立了识字班，每天上课学字。四连在评功时，一排说四排评的不严，四排队员拿出了“抢救证”说：“你们说评的不严，咱们比比谁的抢救证多”。
  不打下太原不回家。
    寿阳民工孙友鱼、孙二牛，于十月廿日送器材时开了小差，到了家里见秋已收完，粮食也装到了瓮里，又看见村里男女老幼都忙着支前，感动的他们又自动回了队。太谷六十岁的车夫石光说：“阎锡山兵农合一，没收了我的地，儿子被抓去当了兵，家里光剩下我老俩口子，饿了一春天，这回不打下太原出不了我的气。”太谷四区民工临出发前，各村都立了合同：“不打下太原不回家”。孝义史元宰说：“这可是我出气的时候了。阎老锡抢走了我老婆，三年不见面了，连音信也没有”。平遥北名梁永隆的妻子来信说：“咱的秋，群众都帮着收割到家，能打三石；麦子也种上了。咱春生儿身体很好，希你注意身体，积极工作，胜利后回来”。
