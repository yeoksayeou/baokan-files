[Taihang Electric Dispatch] Schools in the newly liberated areas of northern Henan are gradually recovering. The school education in cities such as Jiaozuo, Weihui, Huojia, and Wuzhi suffered severe damage under the years of rule by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits. For example, in Jiaozuo City, during our first liberation, there was one middle school and seven complete primary schools with more than 2,000 students. After two years of brutal rule by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, only four complete primary schools with 1,000 students remained. Since the latter half of October, after our army successively liberated the above-mentioned cities, the democratic government has vigorously carried out the work of restoring school education. The Wuzhi County government sent Mr. Wang Jiyun and Mr. Li Xueting, middle school teachers who returned from Kaifeng and Shaanxi this summer, to coordinate with the education section personnel to contact each complete primary school separately to carry out the resumption of classes. Wuzhi and Huojia counties have temporarily allocated more than 6,600 jin of borrowed grain and 100,000 Jibi currency to solve the difficulties of resuming classes in public and private middle schools. Huojia and other places have also re-ordered newspapers and organized the sale of new books to provide cultural food for the schools. Primary and secondary schools in Huojia have successively notified students outside the school to return to school to resume classes. The teachers and staff remaining in the school are actively working together to level pillboxes and fortifications and repair school buildings. Mr. Li Shenyu, a former professor at Henan University in Kaifeng, volunteered to stay in the county for a short period to participate in the work of resuming classes. As of mid-month, three public middle schools and normal schools and eight private middle schools in Weihui, Jiaozuo, Wuzhi, and Huojia, totaling more than 2,000 students, and thirty-two public and private primary schools (including several junior primary schools, the rest being complete primary schools), with more than 6,000 students, and hundreds of teachers and staff have all resumed their duties and classes as usual.

　　豫北新区学校迅速恢复
  　私立学校四十余座完全复课
    【太行电】豫北新收复城市学校逐渐恢复。焦作、卫辉、获嘉、武陟等城市学校教育，在蒋匪数年统治下遭严重破坏。如焦作市，在我首次解放时，曾有中学一处完小七处，学生两千多人。经蒋匪两年的残暴统治，现在仅剩完小四座学生一千人。十月下旬以来，我军先后解放上述诸城市后，民主政府即大力进行学校教育恢复工作。武陟县府派今夏由开封与陕西返乡的中学教员王际云、李学亭两先生，协同教育科人员到各完小分别接洽进行复课。武陟、获嘉两县，已暂拨借粮六千六百余斤、冀钞十万元，解决各公私立中学复课困难，获嘉等地并补订报纸与组织出售新书，供给各学校文化食粮。获嘉中小学纷纷通知校外学生回校复课，留校师生职员正积极协力平毁碉堡工事，修整校舍。原开封河南大学教授李慎予先生自愿短期内留该县参加复学工作。至本月中旬止，卫辉、焦作、武陟、获嘉的公立中学师范三座、私立中学八座，共学生两千余人，公私立小学三十二座（内有数处初小，余均系完全小学），学生六千余人，教职员数百人均已照常供职复课。
