　　Correctly Implement the Lenient Policy
  　Tianzhen "United Villages" Disintegrate
    [Beiyue News] Tianzhen has achieved results in earnestly implementing the lenient policy and striving to win over and disintegrate the "United Villages." In more than seventy villages north of the Ping-Sui Railway in Tianzhen, the bandit Fu Zuoyi used reactionary landlords to widely establish "United Villages," inflicting extreme slaughter and looting on the local people, and the masses harbored great hatred towards them. After conducting in-depth propaganda and education on the lenient policy among the masses, and emphasizing the importance of winning over and disintegrating the "United Villages," the masses' thoughts of retaliation against the "United Villages" personnel were gradually eliminated. In particular, after we leniently released the "United Villages" personnel we had captured who were not guilty of heinous crimes, after educating and reforming them, other fleeing "United Villages" personnel and their families gained a further understanding of our lenient policy and eliminated their ideological concerns. Under these circumstances, many village "United Villages" handed in their guns for registration one after another, and many "United Villages" personnel's families who had fled for fear of retaliation also moved back one after another. According to incomplete statistics from the Eighth District, from August to the end of October, 114 guns have been collected.

　　正确执行宽大政策
  　天镇“联庄”瓦解
    【北岳讯】天镇认真执行宽大政策，争取与瓦解“联庄”已获成绩。天镇平绥路北七十多个村庄，傅匪作义利用反动地主普遍建立了“联庄”，给予当地人民极大的屠杀与抢掠，群众对他们怀有极大的仇恨。经过对群众深入宣传宽大政策教育，和争取瓦解“联庄”的重要意义后，逐渐消除了群众对“联庄”人员的报复思想。特别将我所俘之非罪大恶极的“联庄”人员，经过教育感化予以宽大释放后，其他逃避的“联庄”人员和家属，对我宽大政策有了更进一步的了解，消除了思想顾虑。在此情况之下，不少村的“联庄”纷纷交枪登记，不少“联庄”人员家属因害怕报复而逃走的也纷纷搬回。据八区不完全的统计，从八月截至十月底止，已收到枪一百十四支。
