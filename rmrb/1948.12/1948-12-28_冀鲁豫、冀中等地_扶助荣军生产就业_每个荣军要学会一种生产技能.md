　　Assisting Disabled Soldiers in Production and Employment
　　Each Disabled Soldier Must Learn a Production Skill
　　[Reported by this newspaper] In order to strengthen the unified leadership and management of the work for disabled soldiers, the Administrative Office and Military Region formally established the Disabled Soldiers Committee in the middle of last month, under which the Disabled Soldiers Management Office was set up. The following decisions have been made regarding the guiding principles for the current work for disabled soldiers:
　　(1) In the future, the basic principle for resettling disabled soldiers will be decentralized placement for home settling and land allocation for production and employment. To implement this principle, all local government and civilian personnel must fully recognize that disabled soldiers have received long-term education from the Party and have been tempered in revolutionary battles. They have shed blood for the revolutionary cause and possess a considerable degree of awareness. Generally speaking, they are politically strong. If they are well-educated and cultivated, most of them can become active members in mass movements and village administration construction, and may even be selected and trained as various cadres. This is a great force that cannot be ignored. As for the "meritorious official mentality" of some of them, it can only be overcome by strengthening education, cultivation, and spiritual elevation.
　　(2) All local government agencies and management departments, such as telephone bureaus, sulfur bureaus, warehouses, etc., should absorb disabled soldiers to participate in work as much as possible. If the disabled soldiers are physically insufficient and do not fully meet the work conditions and cadre requirements, they can be used at a ratio of two people as one person, or three people as two people, according to the instructions of the North China Government. The over-allocated reimbursement can be paid from the disabled soldiers' demobilization and pension funds.
　　(3) A Disabled Soldiers Management Office should be established to specifically handle matters related to the demobilization of disabled soldiers and sick and elderly soldiers, as well as all matters that must be resolved by the Administrative Office after demobilization and rehabilitation. The Military Region's Disabled Soldiers Education Institute and the Administrative Office's Disabled Soldiers School will be transferred to the unified leadership of the Disabled Soldiers Management Office. In addition to accepting instructions from the North China Disabled Soldiers Management Office and implementing the decisions of the Disabled Soldiers Management Committee of this region, the Disabled Soldiers Management Office will be directly led by the Administrative Office in administrative matters and is part of the Administrative Office's organs.
　　[Another Dispatch] The Disabled Soldiers Work Conference in the Central Hebei District stipulated that the tasks for disabled soldiers work in the future are: 1. In resettling disabled soldiers, emphasis should be placed on disabled soldiers from other regions with severe disabilities. Those who cannot take care of themselves will be cared for by the Central Hebei Convalescent Home. Those who can do agriculture will be allocated military land for cultivation. Those who cannot do agriculture will be organized by the county to engage in industry and commerce according to specific conditions, and they will be helped to get married and start families. 2. In pension work, the system must be strictly adhered to, and the perspectives of personal connections, face-saving, and charity must be overcome. 3. The education of disabled soldiers should adopt the principles of unity, care, education, and transformation. In terms of methods, more praise and less criticism should be used. Generally, the Eight Rules of Conduct should be used as educational material. 4. In leading disabled soldiers in production, it is required that each disabled soldier has a profession and knows a production technology. Whether it is agriculture or commerce, as long as it does not violate policies, help should be provided. The focus of leadership is on disabled soldiers from other regions, organizing them to cooperate and help each other, and transforming lazy people who sit idle and deplete their resources through backbone members. 5. Call on disabled soldiers to continue to serve the revolutionary work, and require all localities to mobilize disabled soldier cadres in the countryside to participate in local work, and promote them to village cadres through work testing. 6. In organizational leadership, disabled soldier cadres should do central work, and other cadres should also do disabled soldier work. Problems of disabled soldiers should generally be resolved in the district and village, and the isolated state of disabled soldiers work must be resolutely overcome. The conclusion also pointed out that the guns brought home by disabled soldiers should be handed over to the government. The pockets on the military uniforms worn should be removed, and no new military uniforms should be made for them to wear in the future. The orderlies (caregivers) they brought with them should have their supplies stopped unless approved by Central Hebei.

　　冀鲁豫、冀中等地
  　扶助荣军生产就业
  　每个荣军要学会一种生产技能
    【本报讯】为了加强荣军工作的统一领导与管理，行署、军区特于上月中旬正式成立了荣军委员会，下设荣管处，并对目前荣军工作领导方针上，作出决定如下：
    （一）今后安置荣军，基本上是分散安家，分地生产就业的方针，为贯彻这一方针之执行，所有地方政民人员，均须足够的认识到荣军受过长期党的教育及革命战斗中的锻炼，并为革命事业流过血，具有相当的觉悟程度，一般的说，政治上都很坚强，如果很好的教育培养，大多数可能为群众运动及村政建设中的积极分子，甚至可能选拔训练为各种干部，这是很大的一个力量，不容忽视。至于他们有些人的“功臣思想”，只有在加强教育培养提高的精神下，加以克服。
    （二）各地方政府机关及经营管理部门，如电话局、硝磺局、仓库等，均应尽可能的吸收荣军参加工作。如因荣军体力不足，不完全适合工作条件及干部条件时，可依照华北政府指示，以两个人作一个人，或三个人作两个人使用，其超编制报销数，可由荣军退伍抚恤粮项内开支。
    （三）成立荣军管理处，专门处理荣军与病老军人退伍事项，及退伍复员后，所有必须到行署解决的事项，并将军区荣教院及行署荣校，移交荣管处统一领导，而荣管处，除接受华北荣管处指示，执行本区荣管委员会决定以外，在行政上直受行署领导，是行署机关的一部分。
    【又讯】冀中区荣军工作会议上规定今后荣军工作任务是：一、安置荣军上，着重外籍重残废荣军。不能照料自己生活的，由冀中成立教养院。能做农业的，分给军田耕种。不能做农业的，由县根据具体条件组织他们经营工商业。并帮助他们结婚成家。二、在抚恤工作上，要严格掌握制度，克服人情面子和恩赐观点。三、对荣军的教育，要采取团结、爱护、教育、改造的方针。在方式上要采取多表扬少批评的办法。一般的应以八项守则为教育材料。四、领导荣军生产上，要求荣军每人有一种职业，每人会一种生产技术。无论农业商业，只要不违背政策都应帮助。领导重点是外籍荣军，组织他们合伙互助，通过骨干改造荣军中坐吃山空的懒汉。五、号召荣军继续为革命工作服务，要求各地动员在乡荣军干部参加地方工作，从工作考验中来提拔为村干部。六、在组织领导上，荣军干部要作中心工作，其他干部也要作荣军工作。荣军有问题一般要放在区村解决，坚决克服荣军工作中的孤立状态。结论中并指出荣军回家所带枪支要交给政府。所穿军服要拆去上面的口袋，今后不得再制新军服穿。所带通信员（照护员）除经冀中批准的以外，一律停止其供给。
