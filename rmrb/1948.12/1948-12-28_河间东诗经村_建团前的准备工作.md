Hejian Dongshijing Village

Preparatory Work Before Building the Communist Youth League
    Zhang Shuguang
    Dongshijing Village, Hejian Fourth District, has more than 400 households, and 328 young people between the ages of 15 and 25. In the past, because no one cared about them, most of the young people wandered around, which gave the masses a very bad impression.

    However, since the village started organizing after this year's wheat harvest, a youth committee and three youth groups have been established. Then, when the autumn harvest and wheat planting work was arranged, youth committee members Chu Fanzhen and the other two saw that all departments were busy with work, but no one was taking care of the youth. Therefore, they automatically went to the village's propaganda committee to discuss and decided to merge the youth and propaganda committees to work together on the village's propaganda work. They wrote blackboard newspapers twice every five days and broadcast announcements at any time. Moreover, Li Liandi from the youth group educated Li Shufeng, who previously didn't do any work, to be willing to work. Youth committee member Chu Fanzhen also helped Wang Fengzhang's family plant wheat. During the autumn harvest and wheat planting, the young people did play a significant role, and their practical actions also changed the masses' previous perception of the youth.

    The active elements among the youth were organized and participated in mass work, laying a preliminary foundation. On October 5th, the youth work team went to this village and learned about the situation of the youth. At this time, the village's youth organization had been further expanded. Two propaganda groups, one Chinese cabbage planting group, and other groups consisting of 44 young men made up a total of five groups; and 36 young women also formed six spinning groups to spin thread together. So, they first found seven active elements among them, had informal talks with them, understood their demands, proposed a plan to build the League, and led those youth organizations through them. For example, when Li Chong, Li Kai, and the other three were spinning thread together, they went to talk to them, propagandizing at any time. Because they were taught to read and recognize counterfeit money, Li Chong's mother said, "In that case, it won't be difficult for us to open a teahouse. You should study hard!" Grasping the active elements and doing beneficial work for the masses, the young masses were gradually united, and families were very welcoming. This village was connected by the activities of seven active elements to 24 people, who slowly understood what the Communist Youth League does and how much benefit it would bring to them. Therefore, most of them wanted to join the League. The masses also had a good impression of the Communist Youth League, and some automatically asked their children to participate. For example, Sun Zhijiu said to Chu Fanzhen, "Are you the youth leader? Ask my son to participate! Both of them are old enough."

    The young people were even more eager to participate. For example, Li Shuqi said, "When will we establish it? I keep thinking about it!"

    According to the demands of the youth, the work team proposed the establishment of a preparatory committee for the Communist Youth League. After propaganda, deliberation, and discussion in two meetings, seven people were elected to form the preparatory committee. Then, a meeting of active elements was convened to discuss the conditions for joining the League.

    Opinions were put forward in the meeting, and the preparatory committee adopted them separately, took them to various departments for discussion, and widely publicized these conditions to encourage everyone to sign up.

    The establishment of the Communist Youth League in Dongshijing Village makes us understand that in order for the League to be welcomed by the masses, the establishment of the League should be closely linked to the lives of the masses and young people from the very beginning.

　　河间东诗经村
  　建团前的准备工作
    张曙光
    河间四区东诗经村，共有四百多户，从十五岁以上到廿五岁以下的青年却有三百二十八人，以前因为没人管，青年们大都任意游荡，给群众印象很不好。
    但自从今年麦秋以后，村里从事整理组织时，青年委员和三个青年小组便建立起来，接着当秋收种麦工作布置下来后，青年委员褚凡侦他们三人看到各部门都忙着有工作做，只有青年没人管，所以便自动地去找村里的宣传委员会，和他们商量决定青、宣合并，一块儿干村里的宣传工作，五天写两次黑板报，随时作广播，而且青年小组的李连第把从前不做活的李书峰教育得愿做活了，青年委员褚凡侦又帮王凤章家耩麦子，在秋收种麦中，青年们的确起了相当大的作用，他们的实际行动也改变了群众从前对青年的认识。
    青年中的积极分子组织起来，参加了群众工作，初步基础打下了。十月初五日，青年工作小组下乡到了这村，了解到青年的情况，这时村里的青年组织已进一步的扩展开来。两个宣传组、一个种白菜组，和其他的一共有由四十四个男青年组织的五个小组；而卅六个妇女青年，也组成了六个纺线组，一块儿纺线。于是首先便在他们中间找了七个积极分子，和他们漫谈，了解他们的要求，提出建团计划，并且通过他们去领导那些青年组织。如当李崇、李凯等他们三人伙着在一块纺线的时候，就去找他们谈心，随时宣传，因为教他们识字、认假票，李崇他娘说：“这么着，咱们开茶馆不作难了，你们好好的学吧！”抓住积极分子，为群众作有利益的工作，青年群众渐渐被团结起来了，家庭也非常欢迎。这个村就由七个积极分子的活动串通到二十四人，他们都慢慢了解青年团是干什么的，对自己有多大益处，因此多半都想加入团了。群众对青年团也有好印象，有的自动地要求自己的子弟参加，如孙志九向褚凡侦说：“你是青年头吗？叫俺小子参加吧！两个都够上了。”
    青年们更是渴望参加，如李书启说：“咱们多久才建立呢？心里老想着！”
    工作组根据青年们的要求，提出建立青年团筹委会，经过宣传酝酿和两个会议的讨论，投票选出了七人，组成筹委会。接着又召开积极分子会议，讨论入团条件。
    在会中纷纷提出了意见，筹委会都分别采纳，拿到各部去讨论，并把这些条件广泛宣传，让大家来报名。
    从东诗经村团的建立使我们了解：要使团为大众所欢迎，团的建立一开始就应密切的和群众青年生活联系起来。
