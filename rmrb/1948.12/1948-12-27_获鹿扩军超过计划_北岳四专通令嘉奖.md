　　Huolu Military Expansion Exceeds Plan
  　Fourth Special District of Northern Yue Issues Commendation
    [Northern Yue News] The Fourth Special District Office of Northern Yue recently issued a circular to commend the military expansion work in Huolu County, stating: In this military expansion, Huolu completed the task ahead of schedule and exceeded the quota in just eight days, from the 2nd to the 9th of this month. It mobilized 1,428 new recruits, exceeding the original allocation of 1,300, and achieved good mobilization methods and good quality. This is the result of the active efforts of all cadres in the county and the surge of enthusiasm for joining the army among cadres and the masses based on the increased awareness of the masses after the land reform. The county is now continuing its efforts to achieve even greater victories. This spirit is worthy of commendation. Cadres at all levels in our counties should learn from Huolu and strive for victory in the military expansion work throughout the special district.
