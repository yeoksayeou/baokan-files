Comrade Wu Yuzhang's Revolutionary Story
    He Qifang
    The Earliest Patriotic Thought

    Wu Yuzhang's second brother, Wu Yongkun, styled Ziguang (a former Qing scholar), embraced the Song Dynasty's Neo-Confucianism and was a man who valued integrity. In his childhood, Wu Yuzhang studied "Zizhi Tongjian Jilan" with him by lamplight. When reading about the decline and fall of the Southern Song Dynasty, he associated it with the critical situation of China at that time, as if the pain of national subjugation was right before his eyes. They posted Wen Tianxiang's "Song of Righteousness" and last testament on the wall to recite. They especially liked reading an essay written by Huang Chunyao, a martyr of the late Ming Dynasty: "To see righteousness and not act is not courage." Among them were a few sentences that Wu Yuzhang said he would always remember: "If one lets it go, one will rot like grass and wood; if one endures it, one will compete with the sun and moon for glory." This meant that the distinction between loyalty and treachery lay in that moment of risking one's life. Wu Yuzhang's second brother also wrote Huang Chunyao's deeds after the article. When the Manchus entered the pass, and the city was broken and the country was in danger, Huang Chunyao first asked his wife and younger brother to hang themselves, and then said: "Brother, you go first, I will follow soon." Then he calmly hanged himself. Wu Yuzhang read his article and was very moved by his actions, and he also wanted to be a man of integrity.

    The news of the defeat in the Sino-Japanese War came. Reading Emperor Guangxu's decree of seeking peace, reading such sentences as: "The generals do not know the art of war, the soldiers do not fight with their lives, the army is defeated, and the imperial tombs are shocked," Wu Yuzhang could not help but shed tears.

    This was Wu Yuzhang's earliest patriotic thought, containing national thought under the form of old morality. This was in 1895, when he was seventeen years old.

　　The Propagandist of the Hundred Days' Reform

    After the Sino-Japanese War, there was much talk about the great powers dividing China, and the theory of reform and renovation was also popular. At this time, Wu Yuzhang liked to read the "Shiwu Bao," "Wanguo Gongbao," "Shu Xue Bao," various editions of "Jingshi Wenzheng Xuxin," "Evolution and Ethics," and Kang-Liang's speeches. During the Hundred Days' Reform, Wu Yuzhang obtained those reform documents in the countryside of Rong County, Sichuan, and publicized the new policies everywhere with some like-minded young people, persuading people not to write eight-legged essays anymore. People thought they were crazy and called them "masters of current affairs." But because there was an imperial decree as a basis, the conservatives could only sigh beside them and say that the world had changed. After a hundred days, the six gentlemen were killed, and the new policies were overthrown. The conservatives came out to laugh at them: "I told you it was wrong, you're going to be beheaded!" They quarreled with these people, saying they were not afraid, and used Tan Sitong's heroic story of refusing to seek refuge in the embassy and being willing to be the first to shed blood for the reform to answer these people's ridicule.

    At that time, progressive youths from nearby counties united around Comrade Wu Yuzhang. Later, they went to Japan to study, and many became members of the Tongmenghui.

　　The Change of Constitutional Monarchy Thought

    In 1903, Comrade Wu Yuzhang and his second brother went to Japan to study. At this time, Zou Rong's "Revolutionary Army" was published, raising the banner of revolution. Magazines published by students in Japan, such as "Zhejiang Tide" and "Jiangsu," had many revolutionary texts. In addition to these, Comrade Wu Yuzhang also read some European revolutionary history and Rousseau's "Social Contract." So his thinking changed, and he felt that the revolutionary proposition to overthrow the Qing Dynasty was right. Not only should there be a revolution to restore the Han Chinese nation, but also for the sake of fighting for natural human rights. The French Revolution's killing of Louis XVI was in line with Mencius' saying that "I have heard of the execution of the tyrant Zhou, but have not heard of the killing of a sovereign."

    Deng Xiaoke, who went to Japan with Comrade Wu Yuzhang, was a worshiper of Liang Qichao. On the way, he asked him to meet Liang together after arriving in Japan. Comrade Wu Yuzhang changed his mind and did not want to go after arriving, but Deng really went to Yokohama to worship Liang as his teacher and became Liang's believer.

    At that time, many scholars looked down on Mr. Sun Yat-sen, saying that he had not studied and was illiterate. The Qing government wanted him and added three points of water next to the word "Wen" in his name to indicate that he was a sea bandit. This is just like today's traitors to Mr. Sun Yat-sen scolding the Communist Party as "bandits" or "thieves with pheasant feathers." Deng Xiaoke was this kind of scholar, so he would rather worship Liang Qichao than accept Mr. Sun Yat-sen's proposition. However, Comrade Wu Yuzhang and other youths were the most radical revolutionaries at that time. In 1905, after Mr. Sun Yat-sen arrived in Tokyo, they organized the Revolutionary Tongmenghui with him.

    In 1905, after the failure of the anti-"Suppression Regulations" movement by students in Japan at that time, a mass organization to unite students, the "Student Association Hall," was ignored. Comrade Wu Yuzhang supported it alone for more than nine months, and finally moved them, and everyone enthusiastically restored the organization.

    After 1907, uprisings failed everywhere. At that time, many people were discouraged and disappointed, and even betrayed to seek personal advancement, so that there were very few revolutionaries among the students in Tokyo. Comrade Wu Yuzhang was therefore more determined and inspired, and encouraged the Tongmenghui members in Sichuan to unite revolutionaries from various provinces. At that time, he hosted the "Sichuan Magazine"; Zhang Taiyan hosted the "Min Bao." The "Min Bao" had financial difficulties and often ran out of food. Zhang Taiyan wrote a letter scolding Mr. Sun Yat-sen, saying that he had donated a lot of money among the overseas Chinese, but did not take it out to maintain the Tongmenghui's organ newspaper. Comrade Wu Yuzhang tried his best to mediate and raise money among the Sichuan members to support the "Min Bao."

    In 1908, the "Sichuan Magazine" and the "Min Bao" were sealed at the same time, and Comrade Wu Yuzhang was sentenced to half a year in prison. Because he was a student, the execution was suspended.

　　Opinions on Assassination

    Due to the decline of the revolutionary situation, the atmosphere of assassination arose. From Xu Xilin's assassination of Enming to Qiu Jin's murder, many assassination actions were planned and implemented by the revolutionaries at that time. Duanfang, who guarded the Yangtze River Estuary, and Li Zhun, who guarded the West River Estuary, were both assassination targets.

    But Comrade Wu Yuzhang did not approve of assassination. When Wang Jingwei suddenly wrote to him from the Nanyang Hong Kong area, asking him to send some medicines for making bombs, he replied: "Judging from history, the assassination wind must be strong when revolutions in various countries fail. It is true that people with lofty ideals and benevolence know that the general situation is gone, and they can only die to serve the country. Their ambition is commendable, and their actions are also pitiful. Now our revolution is not without hope. The enemy is spreading rumors that the revolution has failed everywhere in order to disperse the hearts of our revolutionaries. If my brother, who is a famous and eloquent scholar in our party, also carries out assassinations with the brave men of our party, even if it succeeds, it will only allow the enemy to spread rumors, discourage the heroes, and the party will also suffer great losses. I do not approve of this move, so I cannot send the medicines."

    Interestingly, Wang Jingwei sent such a letter:

    "Your letter shows deep love and concern for your brother, which is very touching. But I think the matter of revolution is like cooking rice: there are two essentials for cooking rice, one is the pot and the other is the firewood. The virtue of the pot lies in the word 'constancy'. Water cannot corrode it, fire cannot melt it, and it can endure the crossfire of water and fire. This is just like our revolutionaries who are unyielding and make persistent efforts. The virtue of firewood lies in the word 'fierceness'. The torch is blazing, and the flame is immense. Although the body is destroyed, the remaining heat can be used to cook rice. This is just like our revolutionaries who go forward indomitably and sacrifice their lives for righteousness. It is difficult to weigh which of the two is lighter and which is heavier. The key is to choose one according to one's nature and act accordingly. I think I have little constancy, so I don't want to be a pot but want to be firewood. If you love me, please send me the items."

    The nature of this speculative politician and traitor can be seen from his early years; and the subsequent overturning of clouds and rain, and the gradual decline, can indeed be exhausted by the four words "lack of constancy".

    Although Comrade Wu Yuzhang did not approve of assassination, seeing that he seemed quite determined at the time, he sent him some explosives. But he failed to plot to bomb Li Zhun in Hong Kong, and went to Tokyo to find Comrade Wu Yuzhang. Comrade Wu Yuzhang also arranged everything for him to bomb Prince Regent, and sent Yu Yunjin and Huang Fusheng to Beijing to open the Shouzhen Photo Studio to prepare. Half a year later, Wang Jingwei went to Beijing. Soon the assassination was not held, and Huang Fusheng and Wang Jingwei were arrested for failure. Wang Jingwei became known to the world because of this. In fact, the organizer of this assassination was Comrade Wu Yuzhang, and Yu Yunjin and Huang Fusheng put in more effort, and Wang was only a person who planned to use electric wires to detonate the bomb.

### 吴玉章同志革命故事

　　吴玉章同志革命故事
    何其芳
    最早的爱国思想
    吴玉章同志的二哥吴永锟号紫光（前清秀才），服膺宋人理学，是一个讲究气节的人。幼年，吴玉章同志和他共灯夜读“通鉴辑览”，读到南宋衰亡史实，就联想到当时中国的危局，好象亡国之痛就在眼前。他们把文天祥的正气歌，诀命词贴在墙上诵读，他们尤其喜欢读明末烈士黄淳耀所作的一篇时文，“见义不为，无勇也”。其中有这样几句话，吴玉章同志说他永远都记得：“一则放之须庾，而已与草木同腐矣；一则忍之须庾，而已与日月争光矣。”这是说忠奸之分就在那临危授命的一刹那间。吴玉章同志的二哥又把黄淳耀的事迹写在那文章的后面。满清入关，城破国危时，黄淳耀先叫他的妻子，弟弟上吊，然后说：“兄弟，你先走一步，我隋后就来。”他也就从容自缢而死。吴玉章同志读着他的文章，又很感动于他的行动，自己也就想做一个节义之士。
    甲午战争失败的消息传来了。读着光绪求和的诏书，读到这样的几句话：“将不知兵，士不用命，师徒挠败，陵寝震惊”，吴玉章同志就不禁落下泪来。
    这是吴玉章同志最早的爱国思想。包含在旧道德形式之下的民族思想。这是一八九五年，这时他十七岁。
　　戊戌新政的宣传者
    甲午战争后，列强瓜分中国之说很盛，而变法维新之说亦流行。吴玉章同志这时喜欢读的书刊是时务报，万国公报，蜀学报，经世文正续新各编，天演论，和康梁的言论。戊戌政变时，吴玉章同志在四川荣县乡下得到那些变法的文件，就和一些志同道合的青年到处宣传新政，劝人不要再作八股，人家觉得他们象疯狂了一样，称他们为“时务大家”。但因为有皇帝的诏书为根据，守旧的人只能在旁边叹气，说世道变了。一百天过去了，六君子被杀，新政被推翻，守旧的人这时就出来嘲笑他们了：“早说不对嘛，要杀头哩！”他们就和这些人吵，说不怕，并用谭嗣同拒绝到使馆避难，甘愿作第一个变法的流血者的英勇故事来回答这些人的嘲笑。
    当时附近各县的进步青年都团结在吴玉章同志的周围。后来他们到日本去留学，许多都成了同盟会的会员。
　　君主立宪思想的改变
    一九○三年，吴玉章同志和他的二哥到日本去留学。这时，邹容的“革命军”一书出来了，打出了革命的旗帜。留日学生所出的“浙江潮”、“江苏”等杂志都有许多革命的文字。在这些之外，吴玉章同志又读一些欧洲革命史和卢梭的“民约论”。于是他的思想为之一变，觉得推翻满清的革命主张是对的。不仅为光复汉族的国家应该革命，而且为争天赋人权也应该革命，法国大革命杀路易十六正与孟子说的“闻诛一夫纣矣，未闻弑君也”相合。
    和吴玉章同志一道去日本的邓孝可是一个崇拜梁启超的人，在路上曾约他到日本后同去见梁。吴玉章同志思想改变，到后却不愿去，而邓却真到横滨拜梁为师，成了梁的信徒。
    当时的读书人多看不起孙中山先生，说他没有念过书，不识字。满清政府通缉他，把他的“文”字旁边加三点水，以表示是海寇。这正如今天孙中山先生的叛徒们骂共产党是“奸匪”，或者“插野鸡毛的贼寇”一样。邓孝可就是这一类读书人，因此宁愿崇拜梁启超，而不能接受孙中山先生的主张。然而吴玉章同志和另外一些青年却是当时的最激进的革命派。一九○五年孙中山先生到东京后，他们就和他一起组织了革命同盟会。
    一九○五年，当时留日学生反对“取缔规则”运动失败后，一个团结学生的群众组织“留学生会馆”竟至无人过问。吴玉章同志却一人支持了九个多月，终于感动了他们，大家又热心来恢复了组织。
    一九○七年以后，到处起义失败，当时灰心失望以至变节求个人出路者很不少，以至东京留学生中革命者竟寥寥可数。吴玉章同志却因此更加坚定振奋，把四川的同盟会员鼓舞起来，以团结各省的革命者。当时他主办“四川杂志”；章太炎主办“民报”。“民报”经费困难，常至断炊，章太炎曾写信大骂孙中山先生，说他在华侨中捐了许多钱，却不拿出来维持同盟会的机关报。吴玉章同志竭力调和奔走，后来在四川会员中捐了许多钱去支持“民报”。
    一九○八年，“四川杂志”与“民报”同时被封，吴玉章同志并被判半年徒罪。因为是学生，结果缓期执行。
　　对于暗杀的意见
    由于革命形势低落，暗杀的风气起来了。从徐锡麟刺恩铭，至秋瑾被杀后，许多暗杀行动为当时的革命党人所计划着，实行着。当时守长江口的端方和守西江口的李准都是暗杀对象。
    但吴玉章同志却是不赞成暗杀的。当汪精卫从南洋香港一带忽然写信给他，要他寄些制造炸弹的药品去的时候，他回信说：“征诸历史，各国革命失败时，则暗杀之风必盛。诚以志士仁人知大势已去，唯有一死以报国。其志可嘉，其行亦可悯矣。今我革命非无希望，敌人正造谣说革命处处失败，以图涣散我革命之人心。兄为我党有名而能文之士，如果亦随吾党勇壮之士实行暗杀，即使有成，亦徒使敌人造谣，志士灰心，而党亦受莫大损失。弟不赞成此举，故不能寄药品来。”
    有趣味得很，汪精卫又寄来这样一封信：
    “来信爱弟深挚，令人感激。但弟以为革命之事譬如煮饭：煮饭之要具有二，一曰釜，一曰薪。釜之为德在一恒字，水不能蚀，火不能融，水火交煎，皆能忍受，此正如我革命党人百折不挠，再接再厉。薪之为德在一烈字，炬火熊熊，火焰万丈，顾体质虽毁，借其余热可以熟饭，此正如我革命党人一往独前，舍生取义。二者之为德孰轻孰重，颇难轩轾，要在各视其性之所近，择一而行之耳。弟自顾素鲜恒德，故不愿为釜而愿为薪。兄如爱我，望即赐寄各物。”
    这一投机政客，卖国汉奸的本质从他的早年已可看出一点朕兆；而以后的翻云覆雨，日趋下贱，的确可以“素鲜恒德”四字尽之。
    吴玉章同志虽不赞成暗杀，但看到他当时似乎颇为坚决，也就给他寄了些炸药去。但他在香港谋炸李准不成，又到东京找吴玉章同志。吴玉章同志又为他炸摄政王布置一切，派喻云纪、黄复生到北京开守真照像馆，进行筹备。半年后，汪精卫去北京。不久暗杀尚未举行，而黄复生、汪精卫贲事失败被捕。汪精卫以此为世所知。实则此次暗杀组织者为吴玉章同志，实行者喻云纪、黄复生费力更多，汪仅一预拟之用电线放炸弹的人而已。　　　　　　　　（本节完，全文未完）
