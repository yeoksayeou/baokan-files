　　【Taihang News】The land reform work in Pingshun County was completed in mid-November, with the exception of a few villages that are still continuing to finalize it. On the 21st of last month, the County Committee of Pingshun specially convened an enlarged meeting of county and district cadres to summarize the completion of land reform work throughout the county. Prior to the meeting, each district systematically summarized the work of three typical villages. During the meeting, after reports and discussions, Comrade Chen Yushan, the Secretary of the County Committee, gave a concluding report, pointing out the achievements, experiences, and shortcomings in the entire completion of land reform, and decided to shift the focus to mobilizing the masses for winter production, while continuing to resolve the remaining issues in some villages.

　　The county has a total of one hundred and eighty administrative villages. Twenty-two villages were experimented with this spring, twenty-three villages underwent thorough correction before the August meeting, and the conclusion was carried out in two batches after the August meeting, which has now been fully completed. According to the statistics of fifty-nine villages: compensation was given to 500 middle-peasant households who were wrongly struggled against, accounting for 58.2 percent of the total number of wrongly struggled households; 235 landlord and rich peasant households were resettled, accounting for 75.2 percent of the total number of landlords and rich peasants; 285 poor peasants, farm laborers, and new middle-peasant households were adjusted, accounting for 55.5 percent of their own class. The remaining households that have not been compensated, resettled, or adjusted are able to maintain their lives and have a certain level of means of production and livelihood for production. In terms of policy implementation, according to the statistics of six districts: Thirty-two villages implemented the policies correctly, the enthusiasm of the masses for production was improved, there were no deviations, and there were no problems. Ninety-three general villages basically implemented the policies correctly, but the ideological mobilization of the masses was not good enough, or there were few problems. Twenty-five villages had problems in the implementation of policies, the masses were dissatisfied, and the enthusiasm for production has not yet been mobilized. In short, the vast majority of villages correctly implemented the Party's policies and achieved the goal of unity and production.

　　平顺完满结束土改
  　继续解决遗留问题全力发动冬季生产
    【太行讯】平顺的结束土改工作，于上月中旬除个别村正继续进行扫尾外，全县已告完成。上月二十一日，该县县委会特召开全县县、区扩干会议，总结全县结束土改工作。事前每个区均较系统地总结了三个典型村的工作。会议中经过汇报讨论，最后由该县县委书记陈玉山同志作了总结报告，指出在整个结束土改中的成绩经验与缺点，决定除继续解决部分村庄的遗留问题外，全力转向发动群众冬季生产。
    该县共一百八十个行政村，今春实验了二十二个，八月会议前进行彻底纠偏的二十三个村，八月会议后分两批进行结束，现已全部完成。根据五十九个村的统计：补偿错斗中农五百户，占整个误斗户的百分之五十八点二；安置地富二百三十五户，占整个地富的百分之七十五点二；给贫雇及新中农调剂了二百八十五户，占其本阶层的百分之五十五点五。其余没有补偿安置及调剂之户，均能维持生活，有一定水平的生产与生活资料，进行生产。在执行政策上，据六个区统计：政策执行正确，群众生产情绪提高，没有偏向，没有问题的三十二个村，基本上执行政策正确，但群众思想发动不够好，或者少有毛病的一般村共九十三个；在执行政策上出了毛病，群众不满，生产情绪仍未发动起来的二十五个村。总之，绝大多数的村庄，是正确的执行了党的政策，达到了团结生产的目的。
