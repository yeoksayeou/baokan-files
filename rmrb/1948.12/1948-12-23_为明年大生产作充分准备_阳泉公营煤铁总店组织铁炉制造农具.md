In order to create favorable conditions for the restoration and development of agricultural production, the Baoxingheng branch of the Yangquan Public Coal and Iron Main Store organized iron furnaces to manufacture farm tools in large quantities. Since the beginning of winter, the Baoxingheng Public Coal and Iron Main Store has sent cadres to help various villages and townships rectify the furnace industry. To solve their financial difficulties, orders were placed in advance for millet worth 692,500 jin. For the large hoe blades alone, more than 25,000 pieces were ordered. The large hoe blades produced in the city and parts of Pingding and Yu counties are the most famous for being rust-proof, unbreakable, easy to use, and durable. There are currently 101 hoe furnaces, 8 iron shovel furnaces, 10 raw ploughshare furnaces, 1 green ploughshare furnace, and 9 waterwheel furnaces in the city. Each furnace is actively improving its business management, training apprentices, and improving and increasing production. Xiaoxizhuang Village in the Third District has 27 furnaces. Under the leadership of the village's hoe industry cooperative, 12 young people were mobilized to become apprentices before the autumn. The cooperative helps them with 720 jin of rice per month for food expenses. After two months of hard work, they are now able to help the masters with more work. The Baoxing Waterwheel Factory in the urban area has increased from six furnaces to nine since the beginning of winter. The workers have changed from fixed wages to a profit-sharing system (in addition to meals, the net profit is divided into 80% for the workers and 20% for the public). Each furnace has increased its monthly output from five to seven or eight waterwheels. In the past, it took one and a half jin of coal to make one jin of iron, but now one jin of coal is enough. In the past, some useless broken iron pieces were discarded, but now they are all joined together to make parts. From the beginning of September to the beginning of December, the factory produced a total of 240 waterwheels in three months. The workers are in high spirits and guarantee to complete the task of producing 500 waterwheels, and strive to exceed it by 200. The Yangquan Baoxingheng Public Coal and Iron Main Store has now acquired 12,435 large hoe blades, 1,250 ploughshares, 2,677 raw iron plough fittings (for farming), 880 seeding dibbles (for sowing), 170 waterwheels, and 13,700 water bucket hoops. It is still continuing to purchase in large quantities, preparing to ship out the first batch of 100,000 hoe blades next spring to meet the urgent needs of various places.

　　为明年大生产作充分准备
    阳泉公营煤铁总店组织铁炉制造农具
    【本报讯】为创造恢复与发展农业生产的有利条件，阳泉市公营煤铁总店宝兴亨及早组织铁炉大量制造农具，入冬以来，该市宝兴亨公营煤铁总店即派出干部帮助各村乡整顿炉业。为解决其资金困难，先后预价定货达小米六十九万二千五百余斤，仅大锄片一项，即定购下两万五千余张。该市与平（定）盂（县）一部分村庄出产之大锄片最负盛名，不锈不折，好使耐用。该市现有锄炉一○一座，铁锹炉八座，熟铧炉十座，生铧炉一座，水车炉九盘，各炉正积极改善经营管理，培养徒弟，提高与增加生产。三区小西庄村有二十七盘炉，在该村锄业合作社领导下，于秋前发动了十二个青年当学徒，合作社每月帮助他们七百二十斤米的吃食费，经两个来月努力学习，现已能够帮助师傅多出活了。市区宝兴水车厂，入冬以来由六盘炉增加到九盘，工人由固定工资改变为分红制（除管饭外，纯利按工人八成公家二成分红），每炉由月产五架增到七、八架。过去打一斤铁需要一斤半炭、现在有一斤炭就够了。过去一些不成器的碎铁头，一向丢掉不用，现在都要接打成件。该厂自九月初到十二月初止，三个月共生产水车二百四十架，工人们生产情绪极高，保证完成生产五百架水车的任务外，还要争取超过二百架。该市宝兴亨公营煤铁总店，现已收购到大锄片一二四三五张，铧一二五○个，生铁贯口（耕地用）二六七七个，种角（播种用）八八○个，水车一七○架，水桶箍一三七○○件，现仍继续大批收购，准备明年开春首批运出锄片十万张，以供各地急需。
