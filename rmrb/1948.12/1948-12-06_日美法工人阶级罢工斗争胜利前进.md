　　The strike struggles of the working classes in Japan, France, and the United States are either continuing to be upheld or expanded, or have ended victoriously.

　　After concluding their first regular continuous strike in November, 450,000 Japanese miners began their second 24-hour general strike in November on the 30th, persisting in their demands for increased wages and improved safety equipment. At the same time, 40,000 Japanese sailors began a 48-hour strike at midnight on the 29th to demand increased wages.

　　The strike of dockworkers on the US East Coast, which lasted for 18 days, was declared a victorious end on the 27th after achieving demands such as increased wages and improved holiday systems. The West Coast dockworkers, who began their strike on September 2, also signed a new contract with shipping companies for increased wages, but because three unions have not yet signed new contracts, the entire West Coast strike is still continuing.

　　The long general strike of French miners, which lasted for eight weeks, ended on November 29. During the strike, the miners, under the leadership of the Miners' Union of the General Confederation of Labor, united to break through the reactionary government's bloody suppression and bravely persisted to the end. This strike dealt a severe blow to French monopoly capitalists, causing them to lose approximately 3.5 million tons of coal in October alone. This strike also forced the reactionary government to make concessions to many other enterprises and dockworkers and meet their demands in order to prevent them from joining the miners' struggle. The labor unrest in France has barely subsided in one wave before another rises. The special committee of French trade unions, including representatives from the General Confederation of Labor, the Christian Trade Union, and the "Workers' Force" union, submitted a request to the government on November 26 for increased wages. The committee also issued a public announcement the day before, opposing the authorities' planned new legislation to suppress labor.

　　Other important international events of the past week are as follows:

　　(1) Revolutionary peasants in the liberated areas of Warangal and Nalgonda in the Indian Hyderabad State have been resisting attacks by the Nehru government's troops and police equipped with the latest weapons. Indian officials admit that "at least five hundred villages" in Hyderabad have been controlled by peasants.

　　(2) Twelve thousand representatives of various political tendencies in France gathered in Paris and decided to establish a National Committee of Freedom and Peace Fighters, and decided to establish local committees of freedom and peace in every region.

### 日美法工人阶级罢工斗争胜利前进

　　日美法工人阶级罢工斗争胜利前进
    日、法、美三国工人阶级的罢工斗争，有些仍继续坚持或扩大，有些已胜利结束。
    日本四十五万矿工在结束其十一月份的第一次定期连续性罢工后，又于上月三十日分别开始了十一月份的第二次二十四小时大罢工，坚持要求增加工资和改善安全设备。同时，日本四万海员为要求增加工资，亦于二十九日午夜开始四十八小时罢工。
    坚持十八天的美国东海岸码头工人的罢工，在达到增加工资和改善假日制度等要求后，已于上月二十七日宣告胜利结束。自九月二日即行开始罢工的西海岸码头工人，亦与航业公司签订了增加工资的新合同，但因尚有三个工会仍未签订新合同，因此整个西海岸罢工迄今仍在继续中。
    法国矿工坚持八周的长期总罢工，已于十一月二十九日结束。在罢工过程中，总工会矿工联盟领导下的矿工们，团结一致地冲破了反动政府的血腥镇压，英勇坚持到最后。这次罢工给了法国独占资本家以严重打击，仅在十月份内，就使法国资本家们损失煤约三百五十万吨。这次罢工亦迫使反动政府向其他许多企业和码头工人让步，并满足他们的要求，以防止他们参加矿工的斗争。法国的工潮一波方平，一波又起。包括总工会、基督教工会、“工人力量”工会三方面代表的法国职工会特别委员会，于十一月二十六日向政府提出增加工资的要求，该委员会并于前一天发表公告，反对当局在准备中的镇压劳工的新立法。
    过去一周中国际上之其他重要事件如下：
    （一）印度海德拉巴土邦瓦兰加尔及纳冈达两解放区内的革命农民，一直抵抗着尼赫鲁政府的最新式武器装备的军队和警察的进攻。印度官方承认，海德拉巴“至少有五百个村庄”已为农民所控制。
    （二）代表法国各种政治倾向的一万二千名代表在巴黎集会，决定建立自由和平战士全国委员会，并决定在每一个地区建立自由和平地方委员会。
