(Jinzhong Electric Dispatch) Employees of the Tongpu Railway in Taiyuan, oppressed by the Yan bandit regime, have been fleeing to the liberated areas to join the workforce. After the Jinzhong Campaign, the Yan bandits re-enlisted employees who had been released and returned by us, tattooing "Exterminate the Communist Bandits, Resolutely Destroy the Communists" on their foreheads and arms. As Taiyuan became critical, all employees between the ages of seventeen and forty-seven were organized into "Overall War Participation Groups A and B." On November 23rd, twenty-four workers from the Taiyuan Tongpu Railway Administration were extracted and added to the bandit army, forced to die for the Yan bandits. Since October, in addition to generally reducing employee salaries by 70% and delaying payment, each person received only 40 catties of coarse grains per month. Employees with families could not survive and had to sell their clothes to make ends meet. Ma Shouqian, a mechanic at the Taiyuan Transportation Section, understood our Party's late policies and, disregarding the enemy's deceptive propaganda, escaped on the night of November 20th despite the rainy weather. Enemy sentries chased and shot at him along the way, piercing his pants. He said, "I would rather die than work in the liberated area." Wang Junjie, a former foreman of the Taigu Engineering Section, and Dai Shuangxi, a deputy foreman, and two others attempted to escape six times but were unsuccessful. Finally, on the night of November 27th, they climbed out of the outer moat, crossed barbed wire and minefields, braved the danger of death, broke through the blockade, and joyfully arrived at our army's position, where they were protected and received by the People's Liberation Army. In the past three months, eighty-six people have voluntarily registered with the Jinzhong Section Management Committee to request job assignments, and sixty-two people have already been assigned to work in various sections and stations at their original positions and salaries.

　　同蒲路员工逃脱阎匪压榨
    决心为人民铁路服务
    【晋中电】被阎匪压榨下的太原同蒲铁路员工，纷纷逃来解放区，参加工作。晋中战役后，阎匪将我释放返回之员工收编，在头额两臂用针刺上“剿灭共匪，坚决灭共”等字样。太原告急，又把所有年在十七至四十七岁之员工，编成“总体参战甲乙组”。十一月二十三日，复将太原同蒲铁路管理局工役二十四人抽出，补充匪军，逼迫替阎贼送命。十月份以来，除将员工薪金普遍减少七成还拖延不发外；每人每月仅发杂粮四十斤。带家眷的员工们无法生活，以卖衣服糊口。太原运输段车工马守谦了解我党晚政策后，不顾敌人欺骗宣传，冒着阴雨于十一月二十日夜逃出，途中敌人哨兵尾追的枪弹，将他的裤子打穿，他说：“宁死了我也要到解放区工作”。原太谷工务段工头王俊杰，副工头戴双喜等四人，曾六次出逃受阻未成，终于十一月二十七日晚，爬出外壕，越过铁丝网、地雷群冒着生命危险，突破封锁，欣喜到我军阵地，受到解放军的保护与招待。近三个月来，前往晋中段管委会自动登记要求分配工作者有八十六名已有六十二人，依原职原薪分配各段站工作。
