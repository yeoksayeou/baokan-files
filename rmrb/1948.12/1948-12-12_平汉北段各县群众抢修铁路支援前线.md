    Masses in Counties Along Northern Section of Pinghan Railway Rush to Repair Railway to Support Front Lines

    [This Newspaper Reports] "Repair communications and support the front lines!" The masses in Yuanshi, Gaoyi, Xingtai and other counties are actively repairing the Pinghan Railway. In mid-last month, after receiving instructions to repair the road, the masses along the Yuanshi, Gaoyi, and Xingtai counties discussed enthusiastically: "Repair! Repairing the Pinghan Railway will mean we won't lack coal for burning." Upon hearing about the road repair, more than 60 people from Fucun Village in Yuanshi immediately signed up; Gaoyi County originally planned for 10,600 laborers, but the actual number exceeded 2,000; 800 people from the Fourth District of Xingtai participated in the road repair. Beforehand, each county hired workers familiar with the railway to conduct surveys, measurements, and division of labor by section. Each county also established a road repair command, divided into squads and teams. During the road repair, the masses showed great enthusiasm, working from dawn till dusk. Some people in the Chengguan District of Yuanshi didn't even rest at noon. Laborers from Yanbao Village ate breakfast before dawn, preparing to go to work; Li Dongjiu from Shahewowo in Xingtai began shoveling earth without understanding why; some children in Gaoyi and Xingtai also participated in picking up stones. The masses everywhere hummed: "Smash the roadbed tight, hey! Lay the rails, hey! The great army goes south to eliminate Chiang Kai-shek, the old dog!" To repair quickly and well, each county team and village launched challenges and competitions. Everyone said: "It's different from repairing roads for the enemy in the past. This is for ourselves. This time, we must repair it well." During breaks, propagandists explained the victorious news from various battlefields, encouraging the morale of the masses. Thanks to the close leadership and organization of the counties, the tasks were completed ahead of schedule. The Fourth District of Xingtai completed the planned three-day task in two days; Gaoyi County calculated that one laborer would complete two cubic meters of work in seven days, but the task was completed three days ahead of schedule. Pointing to the endless roadbed, the masses said: "This railway will always be ours." (Kui Lin, Jin Bei, Xiu Tian, Xian Chen, Yu Shu)

    [This Newspaper Reports] The road repair work in the Handan Railway Station Area began on November 24th. A total of 2,833 cadres and people participated. The originally scheduled five-day road repair project was completed in three days thanks to everyone's active efforts. In particular, Houjie, Zhongxin Street, and Xihepo completed their tasks in just over a day. In the process of successfully completing the task, a large number of heroes and model workers emerged. There were twelve model groups, including the first, second, third, and tenth groups of Xiaoguan Road, the fifth and third groups of Nandalu, and twenty-five model individuals. For example, Liu Yukui from Xiaoguan Road was disabled with only one arm. This time, he served as a cook for the road repair. To ensure that everyone had food to eat, he started repairing the stove the day before work, continuing until late at night. Comrades from the district advised him to go back, but he said, "An army marches on its stomach," and he only rested at dawn. Ji Dexing is 59 years old and past the age for work, but he voluntarily participated and worked very hard, resting only to eat and refusing to let anyone replace him. When village cadres asked him why he was so enthusiastic, he said, "Repairing the road is beneficial to the country and to myself. It's convenient for transporting grain and troops, and we can eliminate Chiang Kai-shek quickly and live in peace. Besides, when the train is running, it will also greatly help with small businesses." Li Shuzhen, the director of the women's association in Zhongxin Street, was also very active in the road repair. She didn't use a shoulder pole, but carried earth and picked up stones very cleanly. She also advised others, "The stones are transported from Shanxi, how difficult and expensive it is, we must pick them clean!" Also, Xiao Sen, the leader of the first group in Nanxinzhuang, prepared all the furniture completely and without a shortage the day before work began. He also led the way in work by setting an example.

    On the second day after the completion (October 27th), the district convened cadres from each street who participated in the road repair to summarize the following experiences from this road repair:

    (1) It is very important to democratically formulate discipline and supervise each other. For example, the South Gate South Street discussed: "Whoever is late for work will be fined one session without rest." The next day, ten minutes after the whistle of the fire mill blew, everyone was assembled. (2) Assigning lazy people and cadres to the same group can transform them. For example, Duan Xing from Zhongxin Street was lazy when he was in a group with others, but he became much more diligent when he was assigned to a group with cadres. (3) Preparations must be done well. Prepare all the furniture beforehand, so that work can be started immediately without delay. The front street did a good job in this regard. (4) The selection of team leaders is very important. The first thing to consider is whether he can lead and set an example, which plays a decisive role in the quality of the entire group. (5) Propaganda should be closely integrated with the work to promote the successful completion of the entire task. For example, the activity blackboard created this time played a very important role.

    The Railway Station Area ran a blackboard newspaper during this road repair, closely integrating it with the actual work, truly playing a role in propaganda and encouragement. The method was to move the blackboard newspaper from one end of the work site, passing it from group to group. In three days, it published a "Road Repair Clapper Talk," two "Road Repair Model Workers" articles, praised twelve groups, and individually praised twenty-five people. It also criticized seven people. These materials were all compiled from good examples and bad examples found in the work. Everyone was very willing to read it. Wherever the blackboard newspaper was carried, it was immediately crowded with people. After it passed, people always said, "Merit is not concealed, and those who are disobedient go on the blackboard." For example, Pei Zhenshan from Peizhuang did not pick up the stones cleanly and did not listen to advice. After this matter was published, others said, "Don't learn from him!" Conversely, Li Minghe picked up stones very cleanly and patiently. He was praised in the blackboard newspaper, which influenced everyone to be active. He not only picked them out of the pit, but also piled them up one by one. In addition, Li Xi from the front street was playing with stones on the first day of work, not doing his job properly. After being criticized in the blackboard newspaper, he worked very hard the next day and said, "If I had known about the blackboard newspaper, I would have taken the good path sooner."

    平汉北段各县群众抢修铁路支援前线
    【本报讯】“修复交通，支援前线”，元氏、高邑、邢台数县群众积极修复平汉路。上月中旬，元、高、邢等县沿线群众接到修路指示后。纷纷议论说：“修！修起平汉路，我们也不缺煤烧了。”元氏富村群众，一听说修路，立即有六十多人报名；高邑县原计划民工一万零六百人，实到超过两千余人；邢台四区参加修路者达八百余人。事前，各县均聘请熟悉铁路的工人，调查测量按段分工。各县并成立了修路指挥部，下分中队小队等组织。修路中，群众热情极高，起早搭黑的修。元氏城关区有些群众晌午也不休息，阎堡村民工天不亮就吃早饭，准备上工；邢台沙河窝李冬九，不明就上工铲土了；高邑邢台有些儿童也参加了拣石子。群众到处哼着：“砸好路基呀嗨！铺上铁轨呀嗨！大军南下消灭狗老蒋！”为修的快修的好，各县队与队、村与村相互掀起了挑战竞赛。大家说：“和过去给敌人修路不一样了，这是给自己修的，这下我们要修好。”休息的时候，宣传员讲解着各战场胜利消息，鼓舞了群众的情绪。由于各县领导与组织的严密，均提前完成了任务。邢台四区计划三天的任务两天就完成了；高邑县按二立方公尺计算一个工得七天才完成，结果提前三天完成了。群众指着无尽头的路基说：“这条铁路永远是咱们的。”（奎林、晋北、修田、献琛、玉书）
    【本报讯】邯郸车站区的修路工作，是从十一月二十四日开始的，参加干部和群众共二千八百卅三人，原定的五天修路工程，在大家积极努力下三天的时间就全部完成了，特别是后街中心街西河坡等一天多就交了工。在胜利完成任务的过程中，涌现了大批英雄和模范，光模范组就出现了十二个，其中有小官路一、二、三、十组，南大路第五第三组等，另外还有二十五个模范人，象小官路的刘玉奎，是一条胳膊的残废人，这次修路中，他担任伙夫工作，为了保证大家吃上饭，他在开工前一天，就着手修理锅灶，一直弄到深夜。区里同志劝他回去，他说：“兵马不动，粮草先行，”结果干到天亮才休息。冀德兴今年五十九岁了，不在修工年龄，可是他自动参加，并且干的十分卖力气，除了吃饭，整天不休息，别人要替他，他也不肯让。村干问他为啥这样带劲，他说：“修路对国家对自己都有利，运粮运兵方便，快点消灭了蒋介石，咱好过安生日子。再说，火车通了，做个小买卖也有很大帮助。”中心街妇会主任李淑珍修工也很积极，不拿镞就抬土，拣石子也很干净。并劝别人说：“石头从山西运来，多困难，还得化好多钱，可得要把它拣净！”还有南辛庄第一组组长肖森，动工前一天，就把家具准备得齐齐楚楚一样不缺，在工上还以身作则领着头干。
    完工的第二天（十月二十七日）由区上召集各街参加修路干部，总结这次修路时得出以下几点经验：
    （一）民主制定纪律，互相监督很重要，如南关南大街讨论的：“谁上工晚罚他一晌不休息”。第二天火磨拉笛后十分钟，就集合齐了。（二）把懒人和干部编到一组，可以改造过来，如中心街段兴，和别人在一组表现懒，把他和干部编到一组，勤说着就不少干活。（三）准备工作要搞好，事前什么家具都准备齐，一到工作上就干才不耽误时间。前街作的就不错。（四）组长的选择很重要。首先看他能不能领导和以身作则，这对整个组的好坏起着决定作用。（五）工作中要密切结合宣传，以推动整个工作胜利完成，如这次创造的活动黑板，很起作用。
    车站区在这次修路中，办了一块黑板报，密切的结合了实际工作，真正起到宣传鼓励作用，办法是将这块黑板报从工的一头起，一组传一组的移动着看。三天时间，登了“修路快板”一篇，“修路模范”两篇，表扬了十二个组，个别表扬的有二十五名，还批评了七个人，这些材料都是在工作中，找的好典型和坏例子编成的，大家很愿意看，黑板报抬到哪里，哪里马上就挤满了人，过去后，总是有人这样说：“有功不昧，挑皮得上黑板。”如裴庄裴振山，不拣净石子，说也不听，把这个事给他登出来以后，别人都说：“可不跟他学！”相反的李明和拣石子很净，很耐心，在黑板报上受到表扬，影响大家都积极，不但从坑内拣出来，还要一个一个的堆好。此外还有前街李希的，头天到工上拿着石头光玩不正经干，登黑板报批评后，第二天上工可卖力气，自己还说：“我知道登黑板报，早往好路上走了。”
