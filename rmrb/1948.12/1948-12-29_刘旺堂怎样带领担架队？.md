　　How Liu Wangtang Led the Stretcher Team?
　　Comrade Liu Wangtang’s stretcher team, during the victorious advance of "Taking Xinxiang and Liberating all of Northern Henan," completed arduous tasks, and from beginning to end, no one deserted. Wherever they went, the masses supported them, and they became the only stretcher team cherished by the troops and the masses. They won the glorious title of Model Stretcher Team of Xiuwu County. His experience is:
　　First, grasp ideological leadership. He continuously conducted ideological education, establishing the idea that only by overthrowing Chiang Kai-shek can the laborers thoroughly turn themselves over, to consolidate and improve the laborers' enthusiasm for participating in the war. For example, when everyone held a perfunctory attitude towards participating in the war, he would ask, "What are we here to carry stretchers for?" Let everyone discuss it. After discussion, everyone unanimously believed that "We carry stretchers to assist the army in winning battles so that we can defeat Chiang Kai-shek sooner and have a good life; if the army carries them themselves, one wounded soldier would need four people to carry him, so the army would not be able to defeat Chiang Kai-shek quickly. Therefore, we carry stretchers to protect our own interests." Arousing their class hatred for the Chiang bandits, their enthusiasm for participating in the war soared. When the second batch of stretchers came to replace them, they firmly said, "We haven't made any contributions yet! We'll go back after we take Xinxiang and make great contributions."
　　Second, establish the idea of class friendship among the war-participating laborers. During our deep operations in the Chiang-controlled areas, because the masses in the Chiang-controlled areas had long suffered from the cruel oppression and extortion of the Chiang bandits, they did not understand us either. When the laborers arrived in the villages, they were afraid to live in houses and were unwilling to lend things, which caused many difficulties for the war-participating laborers. Comrade Liu Wangtang asked the laborers to discuss the reasons. The laborers had personal experiences, and everyone said, "The masses don't understand us, which is caused by the rule of the Chiang bandits. As long as we help them with some work, they will understand us. Wasn't it the same when the Liberation Army first arrived in our area?" At this time, Liu Wangtang immediately put forward "Geese leave their calls, people leave their names" to encourage everyone. Thus, the movement of people loving people was set off everywhere. Group leader Feng Lichao led the whole group to grind flour and pull ten carts of cotton stalks for the masses. Jiang Shulin alone gave the villagers five loads of radishes. As a result, the villagers' mood changed, and they truly regarded the laborers as their own family, taking out their own quilts for the laborers to cover themselves with, and cooking sweet potatoes for the laborers to eat. The laborers then explained to them that the Liberation Army is an army of the people, which neither beats nor scolds people, but serves the people. In this way, the villagers recognized and understood the Liberation Army. Then, the laborers introduced their own stories of turning themselves over and the democratic life in the liberated areas, as well as our various policies. In particular, those poor peasants were happy to hear this and said, "Take Xinxiang quickly, so that we can live like you!"
　　Third, cultivate activists, rely on them to lead the masses, and set off a wave of enthusiasm for participating in the war and making contributions. Comrade Liu Wangtang used the leading role of model figures to promote various tasks. Every time a model example was discovered in a task, it was immediately praised in front of the team, and everyone was called upon to learn from them. For example, the stretcher bearers from Fanghe Village transported the wounded back in the dark, but the troops had already moved. The next day, they automatically found the troops. Liu Wangtang praised them greatly in front of the team, which made the laborers in Fanghe Village work even harder. Squad leader Wang Shaoying took the lead in carrying water and cultivating land for the masses, and he immediately called on everyone to learn from him. Thus, the "fill the tank movement" quickly unfolded in the stationed village. At the same time, individual naughty laborers were given appropriate criticism through the masses. In this way, the laborers' enthusiasm for participating in the war was full. (Wang Boying, Taihang People's Armed Forces Department)

　　刘旺堂怎样带领担架队？
    刘旺堂同志带领的担架队，在“打下新乡，解放全豫北”的胜利进军中，完成了艰巨任务，自始至终没一个开小差的。他们走到哪里，群众拥护到哪里，成了部队与群众唯一爱护的担架队。获得修武县模范担架队的光荣称号。他的经验是：
    第一、掌握思想领导。他不间断地去进行思想教育，树立民工打倒蒋介石才能彻底翻身的思想，来巩固与提高民工的参战情绪。如大家对参战抱着支差态度，他就提出“我们来抬担架是为了啥？”让大家讨论，经讨论后，大家一致认为“咱们抬担架是为了协助军队打胜仗，好早些打垮蒋介石过好光景；如让军队自己抬，一个伤员，就得四人抬，这样军队就不能很快的打垮蒋介石，所以咱们抬担架就是为了保卫自己的利益。”激发起对蒋匪的阶级仇恨心，参战的热情高涨起来。当第二批担架来换他们时，他们坚决的说：“俺们还没立功哩！打下新乡立下大功再回去。”
    第二、树立起参战民工的阶级友爱思想。在我们深入蒋区作战中，由于蒋区群众长期受蒋匪残酷的压榨勒索统治，对我们也不了解，当民工到村后，他们怕住房，东西不愿借使，参战民工感到许多困难。刘旺堂同志就让民工讨论是啥原因？民工有亲身体验，大家说：“群众不了解我们，这是蒋匪统治造成的，只要我们好好帮助他们做些活，他们就了解我们了，解放军初到咱那里，咱还不是这样的吗？”这时，刘旺堂即提出“雁过留声，人过留名”来鼓舞大家。于是民爱民运动就到处掀起。小组长冯立朝领导全组给群众磨面、拔棉花柴十车。蒋树林一人就给老乡出萝卜五担。这一来，老乡们的心情变了，把民工真正当成自家人，把自己的被子也拿出给民工盖，煮红薯叫民工吃。民工们便向他们解释解放军是老百姓的队伍，不打人也不骂人，是给咱老百姓办事的。这样，使老乡认识了解放军，然后民工们又介绍自己的翻身故事和解放区的民主生活及我们的各种政策。特别是那些劳苦农民听后高兴的说：“快打下新乡吧，俺也和你们一样过过！”
    第三、培养积极分子，依靠他们带起群众，掀起参战立功热潮。刘旺堂同志运用模范人物的带头去推动各种工作。每在一个任务中，发现模范典型后则立即在队前表扬，并号召大家向他们学习。如房河村担架在黑夜转送伤员返回，但部队已转移了，第二天他们自动找到部队。刘旺堂便在队前大加表扬，使房河村民工干得劲头更大了。分队长王少英带头给群众担水、耕地，他就立即号召大家向他学习，于是“担满缸运动”就在驻村迅速的开展起来。同时对个别挑皮捣蛋的民工，通过群众来给以适当的批评，这样就使民工的参战积极性饱满起来。（太行人民武装部王伯英）
