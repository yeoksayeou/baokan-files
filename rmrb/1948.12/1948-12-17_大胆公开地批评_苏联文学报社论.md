Boldly and Publicly Criticize

Editorial of the Soviet Literary Gazette

Criticism and self-criticism—this is the law of Soviet social life. Our construction achievements, the growth of our culture, science, and art, are closely related to the extensive and bold development of principled Bolshevik criticism and self-criticism.

Comrade Stalin has pointed out more than once that an important condition for our development is that every Soviet person must summarize their work every day, fearlessly examine themselves, analyze their work, bravely criticize their shortcomings and mistakes, carefully consider how to make their work achieve excellent results, and constantly improve themselves.

"For writers, this is the same as for other workers. Anyone who is afraid to criticize their own work is a despicable coward and does not deserve respect." (Zhdanov's words)

The decision of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) on the magazines "Zvezda" and "Leningrad" aroused a new creative upsurge in Soviet literature.

However, it is too early to be satisfied with the existing achievements. Tendencies, stale and harmful habits that hinder the development of our literature can still be found frequently.

The Central Committee's decision stated:

"Due to ideological shortcomings in the leadership comrades of the 'Zvezda' and 'Leningrad' magazines, other errors have arisen. This error is that some leadership comrades base their relationship with writers not on the interests of educating the Soviet people, not on the interests of the political direction of writers, but on personal interests, the interests of friendship. Because of unwillingness to damage friendships, criticism has been relaxed. Because of fear of offending friends, works of poor quality are published. This kind of liberalism can make the interests of the people and the interests of the country, the interests of correctly educating our youth, a sacrifice to friendship; and it weakens criticism, makes writers stop seeking improvement, lose their sense of responsibility to the people, the government, and the Party, and cease to progress."

In the spirit of Bolshevism, the Party not only directly and clearly pointed out to writers the dangers that lie ahead of them, but also pointed out the roots of these dangers and the methods to overcome them.

Can we be completely satisfied that our literature has implemented the instructions given to us in the decision of the Party Central Committee? Can we say that healthy, bold, and public criticism and self-criticism determine the entire system of life in our writers' organizations and our literary circles?

No, unfortunately, the facts are not so.

Not long ago, there was such a thing: before Simonov's new novella "Smoke of the Fatherland" was fully published, the first few sections were greatly praised when they were read aloud for the first time. This is a clear example of how the incorrect "tradition" that hinders the development of our literature and the growth of our writers is active in literary circles, without deeply analyzing life phenomena and their reflections in creation, but only endlessly eulogizing the author.

In Soviet literature, there are no and cannot be people or phenomena that "cannot be criticized." This is the main force and permanent guarantee of our sound development and production.

In literature, we can often see the effect of such an unwritten "law," which no one knows who formulated. According to it, a writer who has gained fame for the success of one or several literary works seems to be declared perfect.

Many truly great works that are necessary for society do not seem to belong to the category of being carefully and deeply analyzed. Not a word is said about the individual shortcomings and errors of such works, although this analysis can only help the author to write his works in a way that is more needed and more meaningful to the people.

For example, the situation encountered by one of the masterpieces of modern Soviet literature—Fadeyev's "The Young Guard"—is like this. It is completely appropriate and natural to express joy at the publication of this novel. However, the critical analysis of this work is very one-sided. It only talked about the writer's successes, while the shortcomings and errors in the novel were ignored. When the novel was adapted into a script and appeared on the stage of our theaters, its effects were immediately exposed: the author's shortcomings and errors were deepened by the adapters and directors and expressed extremely prominently.

If these errors had been exposed and eliminated in time, then the influence of the novel and its educational significance would have been increased immeasurably.

The Writers' Union pays too little attention to the issue of literary criticism. The life of the criticism department is too closed and dull—there is no debate, no discussion about creation, no broad review of literary and life issues. A fact sufficient to illustrate this situation is: for example, when the necessary critical essay topics were discovered and discussed by people who could become alternate writers, one of the leaders of the criticism department said: "Anyway, the leading critics can't write, they are too busy..." It seems that only those who can write and raise urgent and important issues can be called leading critics, but the tasks of the "leading critics" are understood in a completely different way within the department. What the entire Writers' Union and every member writer urgently need at present is to fully develop bold, public, comprehensive criticism of the entire literary life.

Strive for Party-minded, combative, courageous criticism that is not timid in the face of literary prestige, highly principled, effective, enthusiastic, and necessary for the development and constant advancement of creation!

### 大胆公开地批评　苏联文学报社论

专栏：

　　大胆公开地批评
  　苏联文学报社论
    批评与自我批评——这是苏联社会生活的法则。我们的建设成绩，我们的文化、科学、艺术的成长，与广泛大胆地开展原则性的布尔什维克批评与自我批评有密切的联系。
    斯大林同志曾不止一次地指出：我们发展的重要条件，便是每一个苏联人必须每天总结自己的工作，毫无畏惧地检查自己，分析自己的工作，勇敢地批评自己的缺点和错误，周密地思考怎样才能使自己的工作获得优良的成绩，并不断地改进自己。
    “对于文学家们，这一点和对其他的工作人员是一样的。谁要是怕批评自己的工作，谁就是遭人卑视的懦夫，他就不配受人尊敬。”（日丹诺夫语）
    联共（布）中央关于“星”与“列宁格勒”杂志的决定，在苏联文学中唤起了新的创作高潮。
    然而满足现有的成绩还嫌过早，阻碍我们文学发展的偏向、陈腐有害的习气，还经常可以得到反响。
    中央委员会决定中说道：
    “由于‘星’和‘列宁格勒’杂志领导同志们思想上存在着缺点，因此就产生了另外的错误。这个错误就是有些领导同志们把他们对文学家们的关系，不是建立在苏联人民教育的利益之上，不是建立在文学家们政治方向的利益之上，而是建立在私人的利益、友情的利益之上。由于不愿损伤友情关系，批评便被放松了。由于害怕得罪朋友，质量恶劣的作品就予以出版了。这种自由主义可以使人民的利益和国家的利益，正确教育我国青年的利益，成为朋友关系的牺牲品；并且使批评松懈，使作家不求改进，丧失自己对人民、政府和党的责任感，而停止进步。”
    党本着布尔什维克的精神，不仅给文学家们直接、明白地指出横在他的前途上的危险，并且指出这种危险的根源，及克服它的方法。
    我们能够完全满意说，我们的文学已经执行了党中央决定中所给予我们的指示吗？能够说健全地、大胆地、公开地批评与自我批评决定着我们作家组织、我们文学界的整个生活制度吗？
    不能，可惜事实并不如此。
    不久以前曾有过一件这样的事情：当西蒙诺夫的新中篇小说“祖国云烟”还没全部发表以前，第一次朗读其中几节时就被大大地赞扬了一番。这就是一个明显的例子，说明阻碍我们文学发展与阻碍我们作家成长的不正确“传统”，在文学界是如何地活跃，不对生活现象及其在创作中的反映进行深刻的分析，而专对作者作无休止地歌颂。
    苏联文学中没有也不能有“不能批评”的人和现象。这是我们健全发展与生产的主要力量和永久的保证。
    在文学中，我们还经常可以见到这样一种不成文“法律”的作用，这种“法律”也不知道是谁制定的。根据它，一个因一部或几部文学著作的成功而获得名望的作家，就好象被宣告为完美无缺的了。
    许多真正伟大的为社会所必需的作品，似乎也不是属于被仔细和深刻分析之列的。关于这种著作的个别缺点和错误一字不提，虽然这种分析只能帮助作者把自己的作品写得更为人民所需要和更有意义。
    譬如苏联现代文学巨著之一——法捷耶夫底“青年近卫军”所遇到的情形就是这样。对这部长篇小说的问世表示欢喜，完全是应该的，自然的。但对这部作品的批评分析却是很片面的。它只谈到了作家成功的地方，而小说中的缺点与错误却被漠视忽略了。当小说改编成剧本出现在我们剧场的舞台上时，它的效果便马上暴露了：著作者的缺点与错误被改编者们和导演者们加深了，并极端突出明显地表现出来。
    如果这些错误及时被揭发和消除的话，那么小说的影响及其教育的意义定会不可限量地提高。
    作家联盟对于文学批评这一问题注意得太少了。批评部的生活太闭塞和沉闷——没有争辩，没有关于创作的讨论，没有广泛地检讨文学和生活的问题。足以说明这样情形的事实是有的：例如当必要的批评论文题目被可能成为候补作家的人发现，并拿来讨论的时候，批评部的领导者之一便说：“反正领导的批评家们不能写，他们太忙了………”好象只有那些能写、能提出迫切重要问题的人，才能够称为领导的批评家，但“领导的批评家”们的任务，在该部内却存在着完全不同的了解。整个作家联盟及每一个盟员作家目前迫切需要的是对整个文学生活全力开展大胆、公开全面的批评。
    为党的、战斗的、勇敢的、在文学威望的面前不胆怯的、高度原则性的、有效的、热烈的、为创造的发展及不断前进所必需的批评与自我批评而奋斗！
