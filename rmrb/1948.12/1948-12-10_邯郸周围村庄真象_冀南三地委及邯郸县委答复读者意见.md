　　The Truth About Villages Around Handan
　　Replies from the Jinnan Third Prefectural Committee and Handan County Committee to Readers' Opinions
　　Jinnan Third Prefectural Committee’s Letter: Editor Comrades,
　　The Party newspaper's exposure and criticism of some deviations in the villages around Handan, along with its urging for us to inspect and reply, and especially the sending of relevant readers' manuscripts for our reference to promote improvement of work and correction of policies, are all very appropriate in our opinion. However, due to our insufficient attention to the Party newspaper's attitude and opinions, and the failure to promptly study and organize replies to the Handan County Committee's review report and the materials from the investigation conducted by the prefectural committee's inspection team in Liu'er Village, we delayed until the October 25th newspaper openly urged a reply. Only then did it attract our serious attention. However, we still felt that we lacked sufficient understanding of the materials. To solemnly resolve these issues, we organized another five-person inspection team to investigate in the county. We now present our preliminary inspection situation and leadership review separately as follows:

　　A. Some Problems Existing in Villages Near the Handan County Committee Residence

　　1. General situation of these nine villages: These villages are located three, five to seven, eight *li* northeast of Handan city, all belonging to Handan County. Because they are close to the city and the train station, many residents in the villages are engaged in small businesses, commerce, and transportation. Some also cultivate or rent out land, but land ownership is generally not high, although living conditions are better. Because class boundaries were not clear at the time, many middle peasants or those engaged in both industry and commerce were wrongly struggled against. According to preliminary investigations alone: ​​in Beisucao Village, 16 households out of the 59 households struggled against were middle peasants and 8 were poor peasants; in Nansucao Village, 7 households out of the 20 struggled against were middle peasants; in Donglaima Village, among the 22 households struggled against, 4 have been clarified as middle peasants. Some of these wrongly struggled middle peasants were engaged in commerce or worked as shop assistants and managers, as mentioned above. From the surface, their lives seemed better, but from the perspective of their ownership and use of the means of production, many belonged to the middle peasant component in rural areas. Secondly, the villages around Handan city were semi-old areas. During the Japanese puppet regime, they were under strict enemy rule, and the puppet *baochang* of each village oppressed the masses and committed all kinds of evil. Therefore, during the re-examination, these people were struggled against. Some of these people were middle peasants or even poor peasants, but the struggle was very fierce.

　　2. The village organization is very chaotic – The old organizations of these villages were kicked aside last December and this spring, and this was done by the district cadres. In Donglaima Village, last December, a district cadre secretly organized a poor peasant group of 340 people. After the New Year, they settled accounts with the old village cadres, but no mistakes were found. The district cadre said that they had followed the old village cadre's line and disbanded the poor peasant group. In February, the district cadre came again to organize a poor peasant group of 70 people, and the leaders were all opposition factions of the village cadres, or impure elements. For example, there was a runaway soldier named Lu Jimin, whom the village cadres sent to the army eight times, but he ran back every time. He was dissatisfied with the village cadres, so he struggled against the village chief, the branch secretary, and the vice-chairman of the peasant association. This had a great impact on the old village cadres and the old organization. After correcting the "kicking aside," some people in the poor peasant group saw that they could no longer struggle against the village cadres, so they dispersed, and both the new and old organizations collapsed. The relationship between the new and old organizations in Nansucao Village was also very bad. Qin Xinglong, the vice-chairman of the peasant association, had a family of six and 1.7 *mu* of garden land. Because of corruption, his door was sealed on December 19th of last year, and he was not released until the wheat season this year. Several carts of cabbage and scallions in his home had all rotted. When he came out, it was time to harvest the wheat, and the poor peasant group harvested the four *mu* of wheat he had been allocated and exchanged it for three *mu* of bad wheat land. Today, party members are illegal in the village, and new village cadres interfere with party members' meetings. Recently, district cadre Comrade Li Xiuwen led a branch meeting at a comrade's house, and a brick still came in from the outside. The issue has not been clarified, and the two sides are still in a bad state of opposition. The relationship between the new and old organizations in Beisucao Village was not bad, but after the party rectification this spring, the district cadre announced on the spot at the poor peasant meeting the dismissal of Niu Yubao, the branch secretary and village chief, Xue Shunqing, the director of the peasant association, and Wang Yongqing, the deputy director, which caused other village cadres to lie down and stop working. These villages all began to become chaotic last winter and this spring. Afterwards, they were not well and seriously rectified, and they are still extremely chaotic today during the investigation. The political quality of the branch party members is also very poor. Among the 63 party members in Beisucao, 43 were developed during the re-examination last year. Some had only attended one meeting, some had never attended a meeting, some did not know they were a party member, and some did not know what a party member was supposed to do. Branch committee member Yang Xianzhen (woman, small district representative) did not even know what a branch was. The core role of the Party is even more out of the question. With such long-term organizational chaos, the Party's policies cannot be implemented. After inspecting the work of these villages, we believe that this problem is the most serious.

　　3. Unresolved issues in the villages after the review

　　(1) Rectification of deviations has not been carried out seriously: Taking Beisucao as an example, district cadre Comrade Bai Menghua once carried out rectification of deviations here before the wheat harvest. He first visited the households that had been struggled against one by one and individually compensated them a little. Then he asked the middle peasants who had been struggled against to submit slips stating what things had been struggled against in their homes, so that they could be compensated. As a result, they reported more than they had lost. For example, Li Xilin wrote a slip saying that things worth about 6 million yuan had been struggled against in his home. Some said they had foreign currency, silk, etc. At this time, the cadres lay down, and the poor peasant group felt that even if all the fruits were given to them, it would not be enough. The leadership did not help to solve these specific problems well, so it was put on hold. Later, it was stipulated that some tables, stools, and furniture of the middle peasants with names on them could be returned to them. However, when the seals were opened, the poor peasant group secretly tore off the slips and distributed the things themselves. This was also because there was no leadership. Some masses could not understand it, and it could not be implemented. According to the city's inspection, it is known that five households of landlords and rich peasants who had been struggled against in the villages of the Chengguan District were begging for food. One was disabled, and four were old, weak, orphaned, and widowed without the ability to produce, and they have not been resettled. Currently, Zheng San, Jin Laoshang, Gao San, and Guo Zhixiang in Beisucao Village have no means of living and sometimes beg for food. In Nansucao, this spring, the county government led the rectification of deviations in the village. However, at that time, it was seen that some landlords in the village were taking the opportunity to counterattack, the class boundaries were not clear for a while, and it was feared that reporting less and getting more would cause chaos, etc., so they abandoned the step-by-step and appropriate rectification of deviations proposed by the prefectural committee and called the poor peasant group to take away the mule of Han the carpenter that had been returned as compensation. This would inevitably affect the mood of the wrongly struggled middle peasants.

　　(2) Secondly, there are many fruits accumulated in the county-affiliated villages that have not been distributed, and many have been damaged. In Donglaima, valuable fruits such as bracelets and watches were stolen. Two rooms of cotton more than a foot thick were rotted. Spinning wheels and looms were damaged by rain. Many fruits in Nansucao were also damaged by rain. Four rooms of clothes, cloth, parcels, and other things are still sealed in Beisucao and have not been distributed.

　　B. The Prefectural Committee's Review of the Above Issues

　　1. The prefectural committee's arrangement and inspection of rectification of deviations:

　　In May, the prefectural committee convened a joint meeting of county secretaries. According to the instructions of the higher authorities and the local situation, production and rectification of deviations work was arranged. Among the eleven counties (cities) under its jurisdiction, some had undergone a major review in the autumn of last year (Handan County was one of the reviewed counties), and some had not been reviewed. Today, it seems that left-leaning deviations are generally present in the reviewed areas. However, due to the limitations of various conditions at the time, it was impossible to carry out a comprehensive and thorough rectification of deviations. For example, some village cadres were kicked aside at the time, or were affected by this and lay down and stopped working. There were few cadres, the mobilization after the party rectification was very large, and the class division had not been well studied. Moreover, it was the busy farming season, even if the cadres could lead the division of classes, it was feared that it would be carried out. Therefore, the policy decided at the time was to reverse the mood of the village cadres, so that they would actively lead production, combined with appropriate and step-by-step rectification of deviations, mainly for wrongly struggled middle peasants, removing hats, and giving appropriate compensation, so that they would have food to eat and land to plant. For landlords and rich peasants who were swept out of the house, they were to be resettled so that they could produce and live, ensuring that no one would starve to death. According to this spirit, has the execution of the villages near Handan County and City been sufficient? From the villages we inspected, it is very insufficient, which also gives us bureaucrats a test. If it were not for the party newspaper's criticism and urging for inspection, we would probably not have understood these actual problems. In particular, the prefectural committee failed to check in time and provide specific assistance, causing the problem to be delayed until now. The prefectural committee is responsible, which is caused by our bureaucracy failing to understand the situation in time and check the work at the lower level in time.

　　Regarding the Handan County Committee's several reviews, we believe that they are not satisfactory. They did not deeply review and recognize the existence of such serious problems with a good self-criticism attitude, which led to the work not being corrected and transformed in time, which is very wrong. We also put forward instructions and opinions after their review, and decided to send cadres to provide specific assistance, and to solve the existing problems in the implementation of the winter production, replenishment, and party rectification tasks.

　　C. Propose a few suggestions

　　1. In order to understand the situation more comprehensively, we originally wanted to visit the readers who reflected the opinions after arriving in the village, so as to solicit opinions from all parties and improve our work. However, as a result of the visit, the masses did not understand these people. This shows that some of them may have used pseudonyms, and the content of the reflection also has some places that do not conform to the facts and are vaguely exaggerated. This is not to say that we judge people and handle affairs, but because we do not write real names and contact addresses, it is difficult for us to understand the truth of the facts and improve our work. In particular, it is even more difficult to deal with materials that reflect some situations that do not conform to the actual situation. I hope the newspaper will pay more attention to it in the future. (This opinion is very correct. I hope that readers will write their real names and addresses in the future so that the relevant agencies can investigate and deal with them. - Editor) In addition, we feel that the newspaper sending us the readers' reflections and opinions on local work to promote our improvement of work is a very good method. We hope that comrades from the newspaper will continue to provide more assistance.

　　Jinnan Third Prefectural Committee
　　Handan County Committee Letter: Editor Comrades,

　　We did not understand the spirit and essence of the Party newspaper's criticism, and did not promptly and conscientiously examine our guiding ideology, work style, and what problems existed in our work, and make a public reply. We only defended certain small discrepancies, which is an unorganized and undisciplined attitude of not paying attention to the Party newspaper's criticism.

　　The Handan autumn review last year started in July and ended in September. The infringement of the interests of middle peasants was very serious in the review. According to current understanding, the wrong struggle against middle peasants in the Sucao area accounted for nearly one-third of the households that were struggled against; those who were swept out of the house at that time accounted for about two-thirds of the households that were struggled against. We did not recognize this serious violation of the Party's policy and principles at that time. Since the land conference last winter and this spring, the mistakes we have made are: first, we still do not recognize the infringement of the interests of middle peasants, and groundlessly and generally believe that the land reform is still not thorough; second, we have an excessive and impure understanding of the old organization, and we do not recognize that good and better village cadres account for the majority. When arranging the spring plowing work, we only generally determined that we would promote good village cadres in the new and old organizations to carry out the spring plowing work. However, in the implementation of each district, the momentum of kicking aside was actually very strong. Some cadres were afraid of falling into the so-called shielding suspicion of the old organization, and they did not dare to approach them, and even a few villages took a striking attitude. In addition, the old cadres were generally intimidated by the atmosphere of being kicked aside, resulting in the chaos of the old village cadres lying down and not working, the collapse of the old organization, the difficulty in promoting work, and the opportunity for landlords and rich bad elements to engage in activities and counterattacks. Although we successively made mobilization and corrections at the district secretary joint meeting one ten days after the spring plowing work was arranged, and at the meetings of good and better old village cadres held in each district afterwards, and the county held four consecutive training classes for militia cadres in April to restore morale, and the county held two sessions of old village cadres' meetings in early June, and the leadership acknowledged the mistake of abandoning most of the old village cadres at the county village cadres' meetings on "July 1" and "July 7" and mobilized everyone to work actively, As a result, the situation of old village cadres lying down and not working and the chaos of village-level organizations, although alleviated, has not yet recovered its vitality.

　　Regarding the rectification of deviations, since the People's Daily published the instructions of the Central Bureau of Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu on the rectification of deviations in Taihang and Taiyue this spring, only individual rectification of deviations work was started in Sucao, the residence of the county agencies. After the prefectural committee issued the instructions on May 15, it immediately made a formal arrangement in the county and districts. At this time, because the wheat harvest was approaching, only propaganda and explanation of the Party's deviation rectification policy were carried out before the wheat harvest, and arrangements were made for the middle peasants who had been wrongly struggled and had no means of living. On June 15, after the wheat harvest, another joint meeting of district secretaries was held to re-arrange the rectification of deviations work. Those wrongly struggled middle peasants whose existing land and property occupied more than the average number of the whole village were to have their hats removed. Those pseudo-township heads and Baochang who ate up public funds should also be compensated except for the embezzled part. The wrongly struggled middle peasants whose land and property were below the average number in the whole village should be resolutely compensated, and those who had not been unsealed should be returned. The fruits not divided in each village should be used as compensation for the wrongly struggled middle peasants, and those who had been struggled against for industrial and commercial assets and had been exhausted should be given loan support, and those who had not been divided should be returned. Because of the shortage of cadres at that time and the leadership's erroneous thinking of being afraid of chaos, it was decided that the district cadres should personally grasp and focus on carrying out the work. Although the working policy at that time was to focus on production combined with deviation rectification, the problem was that we did not have enough understanding of the significance of deviation rectification, and our bureaucratic style of only arranging and not urging or checking caused this work to fail to be implemented, and even the base point deviation rectification work was not done well, and the fruits of many villages were not divided. Just taking the four districts as an example: among the nine villages that were made (Gongcheng, Beiniu Jiao, Tiao Zhuang, Daguan Zhuang, Xiguan Zhuang, Hou Hao Village, Shi Village, Nie Zhuang, etc.), three villages compensated for land, houses, livestock, and vehicles, and six villages only removed the hats of a few wrongly struggled households.

　　There are still the following problems in villages around Handan, such as Nansucao, Laimatai, and Liu'er Zhuang: Nansucao still has eight middle peasants who have not been compensated, and it is true that Han the carpenter's mule was returned and taken away again. The fruits have not been divided, and the tables and stools have been damaged by rain. The contradiction between the new and old organizations has not been resolved, eight party members in the branch do not work, do not attend meetings, and the branch has no leadership, forming a collapse phenomenon. The Beisucao branch has not held meetings for a long time, the village-level organization is loose, the village cadres are not responsible for their work, they are just dealing with public affairs, only six households have been compensated for deviation rectification, two industrial and commercial households have been returned, nine households have not been compensated, four households begging for food have not been resettled, and the fruits have not been divided. The old organization in Donglaima has been defeated, the new organization has not been produced, and when the district cadres went to the village to rectify the village organization, they beat the rich peasant Lu Shoushan, a bad element who provoked the contradiction between the new and old organizations (we have strictly criticized the district cadres who beat people). The fruits have been stolen and damaged by rain, and the branch has not held meetings for a long time. This is enough to prove that the Party newspaper's criticism of us is basically correct. The above serious problems have all appeared in the villages around Sucao, which shows that there is a serious bureaucracy in our leadership style, we do not inspect or go deep, and we turn a blind eye to the chaotic phenomenon below.

　　We are now rectifying the party and mass ranks, combining the distribution of fruits with the deviation rectification work, so as to quickly overcome the chaos of village-level organizations and end the land reform and stabilize the people's hearts. In future work, we will also strengthen the village work in the Sucao area. Finally, I hope that the Party newspaper will provide more guidance.

　　Handan County Committee

　　Editor's Opinion

　　The Handan County Committee has paid attention to the chaotic situation in the villages around Handan and is prepared to seek a solution in the party rectification and the end of the land reform, which is very good. Undoubtedly, this will improve Handan's work in the future. It is hoped that the leading organs of Handan County will continue to conduct in-depth investigation and research, discover the problems existing in the work, and solve them correctly. At the same time, it is hoped that the readers who have raised opinions in the villages around Handan will also change their past attitude of distrust to a certain extent towards the leading organs of the county and district, and actively assist the leading organs and cadres of the county, district, and village to do a good job in the village.

　　In addition, there are also some shortcomings in this newspaper's reporting of this issue, that is, when this newspaper discovered the chaotic situation in the villages around Handan and some shortcomings in the work of Handan County, it failed to thoroughly clarify the situation in a timely manner with the leading organs of Handan County and put forward solutions. The manuscripts written by the former Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu People's Daily reporters were not sent to the County Committee for review in advance, and discussed with all parties to seek a common consensus, resulting in the problem being delayed for as long as six months. We should also pay attention to improving this in the future, so as to establish the correct attitude of the Party newspaper's criticism and self-criticism.

### 邯郸周围村庄真象　冀南三地委及邯郸县委答复读者意见

1948-12-10
第4版()
专栏：检查与答复

　　邯郸周围村庄真象
  　冀南三地委及邯郸县委答复读者意见
    冀南三地委来信编辑同志：
    党报关于邯郸周围村庄一些偏向问题，给以揭露与批评，并督促我们检查答复，特别是将有关读者之稿件寄与我们作参考，以便推动改进工作、端正政策，我们认为这些都是很应该的。可是由于我们对党报态度与意见重视不够，而对督促邯郸县委会的检讨的汇报与地委所派检查组亲自在刘二庄调查材料，也未得及时的研究整理答复，直拖到十月二十五报纸公开督促答复，这时才引起我们严重注意。但是感到了解材料仍感不足，为郑重解决这些问题，我们又组织五人检查组到县调查，今将我们初步检查情形与领导上检讨分述于下：
    甲、邯郸县委住地附近村庄存在的一些问题
    一、这九个村一般情况：这些村庄都是邯郸城东北三、五里至七、八里的地方，均系邯郸县属。因距城市与车站较近，村中居民作小商贩经商运输的很多，也有耕种或出租土地的，但土地占有一般不多，可是生活较好。因当时阶级界限不明确，是错斗了不少的中农或兼工商业者，仅经初步调查：北苏曹村被斗的五十九户中有中农十六户，贫农八户，南苏曹被斗二十户，有中农七户，东来马台村被斗的二十二户中已弄明确的有四户中农。这些错斗中农有些是如上所说兼营商业，或作店员经理的。他们从表面上看生活较好，但从其生产手段占有状况和使用状况上看，不少是属于农村的中农成份的。其次邯郸城周围村庄系半老区，日伪在时受敌统治很严，各村的伪保长，在当时欺压群众为非作歹，因此在复查时，斗了这些人。这些人的成份有的是中农甚至贫农，但斗争的都很厉害。
    二、村组织混乱是很严重的——这些村的老组织在去年十二月和今春曾被一脚踢开，而且是区干包办进行的。东来马台，去年腊月区干即秘密组织贫农组三百四十人，过了年就与老村干算帐，结果没算出差错来，区干说是走了老村干路线，就把这贫农组解散了。二月区干又来组织贫农组七十人，领导人都是村干反对派，或不纯分子，如有一逃亡战士卢际民，村干送他八次到部队，都跑回来了，对村干不满，因而斗了村长、支书、和农会副主任。这样对老村干老组织影响是极大的。纠正了“一脚踢开”之后，贫农组中有些人看到不能再斗村干了，也就漫散了，结果新老组织都垮了台。南苏曹庄新老关系也很恶劣，农会副主任秦兴隆六口人一．七亩园地，因为贪污，腊月十九被封门，今年麦边才被释放启封，家中几车白菜葱已全部烂坏。出来正是要割麦时，贫农组就把他已分得的四亩麦子割了，换了三亩坏麦地。今天党员在村不合法，党员开会新村干就干涉。区干李修文同志最近在一同志家领导开支部会，从外边仍进来一个砖。现下问题仍未弄清是非，双方仍是恶劣的对立。北苏曹新老关系并不坏，可是于今春整党后，区干在贫农会场上当场宣布撤消支书兼村长牛玉保、农会主任薛顺清、副主任王永清，致影响其他村干躺倒不干。这几个村均是在去冬今春，开始混乱起来的。事后又未很好的认真整顿，直到今天调查时，仍是极端紊乱。支部党员政治质量也很差，北苏曹六十三个党员中有去年复查发展的四十三个，有的开过一次会，有的就未开过会，有的就不知自己是一个党员，有的不知党员是做什么的。支委杨先珍（妇女、小区代表），还不知什么是支部。党的核心作用更谈不到。这样长期组织混乱，党的政策是无法贯彻的，我们检查了这几个村工作，认为这个问题是最严重的。
    三、复查后村中未解决的问题
    （一）纠偏未认真进行：就北苏曹来说，在麦前区干白梦华同志在这里曾进行纠偏，他先挨门到被斗户家看，个别补尝了一点，后又叫被斗中农递条写明斗了你家什么东西，以便补尝，结果他们就以少报多，如李西林开条写斗他东西约值六百万元，有的说有洋元、绸缎等，这时干部躺倒，贫农组感到果实都给他们也不够，领导上未很好帮助解决这些具体问题，于是就搁置起来了。后又规定将中农一些桌凳家具上面贴着名的可退给他们。但当启封时，贫农组将条偷撕去，把东西自行分配了，这也是因无领导。群众有些搞不通就贯彻不下去。据市的检查已知道城关区村庄有五户被斗地富要饭，一户是残废，四户老弱孤寡无生产能力，还未得安置。北苏曹村现有郑三、金老尚、高三、郭志祥四家生活无着，有时要饭。南苏曹，今春本由县政府领导该村纠偏，因当时见到有些村中地主趁机反攻，阶级一时划不清，又怕以少报多弄乱了等，而放弃地委所提出的有步聚适当的纠偏，把已退补给韩木匠之骡子又叫贫农组牵去，这样势必影响被错斗中农情绪不安。
    （二）其次是县属几个村子中都有很多果实积存未分，且损坏不少。东来马台果实值钱的如手镯、手表，被人偷去，有两间屋一尺多厚棉花被沤坏，纺车织布机被雨淋坏，南苏曹果实中被淋坏的也很多。北苏曹还封着四屋衣服布匹包袱之类东西未分。
    乙、地委对以上问题的检讨
    一、地委对纠偏的布置及检查：
    地委于五月召开县书联席会议，根据上级指示与当地情况，布置了生产与纠偏工作。在所属十一个县（市）中，有去年秋季经过大复查的（邯郸县即复查县之一），有未经复查的。今天看来，在复查区是普遍存在左倾偏向的。但因当时各方条件所限，普遍彻底进行纠偏不可能，如当时有部分村干被一脚踢开，或受此影响而躺倒不干，干部少，整党后调动很大，对阶级的区划还未很好学习，并且在农忙季节就是干部能领导划阶级，恐也虽进行。故当时决定方针是扭转村干情绪，使其积极领导生产，结合进行适当的有步骤的纠偏，主要是对错斗中农，摘掉帽子，给以适当的补偿，使其有饭吃，有地种。对扫地出门的地富，给以安置，使其能生产能生活，保证不饿死一个人。根据这个精神来检查，邯郸县市附近村庄执行的是否够呢？我们从检查到的村庄来看，是很不够的，这也给我们官僚主义者一个考验。要不是党报批评与督促检查，对存在的这些实际问题，恐还不会了解。特别是地委未得及时检查，与具体帮助，使问题拖延至今，地委是有责任的，这是我们官僚主义未及时了解下情及时检查下层工作所致。
    关于邯郸县委会之几次检讨，我们认为都不够满意，对存在这样严重的问题，未以很好自我批评态度去深刻检讨与认识，致使工作未得及时纠正与转变，这是很不对的。我们对其检讨后也提出指示意见，并决定派干部前去具体帮助，在贯彻冬季生产、抽补、整党任务中，将现存的问题加以解决。
    丙、提出几个建议
    一、我们为更周全了解情况，到村后本想去访问反映意见的这些读者，以便多方征求意见，改进工作。可是访问结果，群众都不了解这些人。这说明其中可能有些化名，反映内容也有个别地方与事实不符合和笼统夸大之处。这些不是说我们看人办事，而是因不写真实姓名与通讯处，使我们难以了解事实真象改进工作。尤其是反映一些不合实际情况的材料，更难处理。希望报纸今后多加注意。（这个意见很对，希望以后读者来信都要写清真实姓名地址，以便有关机关调查处理。——编者）此外，我们感到报社将读者之反映与对当地工作意见寄与我们，推动我们改进工作，这是一个很好的方法。希报社同志仍多加帮助为盼。
    冀南三地委会
    邯郸县委来信编辑同志：
    我们对党报的批评，没有从精神实质上理解，并及时认真检查我们的领导思想作风，和工作上究竟存在那些问题，并作公开答复，仅是对某些小的略有出入的情况提出辩护，这是对党报批评不重视的无组织无纪律态度。
    邯郸去年秋季复查，从七月开始至九月结束。在复查中侵犯中农利益很严重。据现在了解，苏曹一带村庄错斗中农就将近占被斗户的三分之一；被扫地出门的，在当时约占被斗户的三分之二。这种严重违反党的政策的原则错误，在那时我们是不认识的。自去冬今春土地会议以后，我们所犯的错误，一是对侵犯中农利益依然不认识，并无根据地笼统地认为土改仍不彻底；二是对老组织的不纯认识过火，不认识好的、较好的村干占多数。在布置春耕工作时，仅笼统地确定，推动新老组织中好的村干进行春耕工作。而各区在执行中，实际上是一脚踢的劲头很大。对老组织，某些干部怕落所谓包庇嫌疑，不敢接近，甚至少数村采取打击的态度。此外老干部被一脚踢的空气吓倒的也比较普遍，致造成老村干躺倒不干、老组织垮台、工作难以推动，地富坏分子趁机活动、反攻的混乱现象。虽我们曾先后在春耕工作布置一旬后，在区书联席会上和以后各区召开好的较好的老村干会上作了动员纠正，四月全县又连续召开四期民兵干部训练班，恢复情绪，六月初召开两期全县老村干会议，“七一”“七七”全县村干会上，领导上承认了大部抛开老村干的错误，动员大家积极工作，结果老村干躺倒不干村级组织混乱等情形，虽有减轻，但仍未恢复元气。
    关于纠偏工作，自今春人民日报发表了晋冀鲁豫中央局对太行太岳纠偏的指示后，仅在县机关住地苏曹，开始了个别户的纠偏工作。地委发出五月十五日的指示后，紧接着即在县区作了正式的布置。这时因即将麦收，故在麦收前，仅作了对党的纠偏政策的宣传解释工作和对错斗中农生活无着的作一安置。在麦收后六月十五日又召开区书联席会，重新布置了纠偏工作，对错斗中农现有土地财产占全村平均数以上的，摘掉被斗户帽子。对食污公款的伪乡长、保长除贪污部分外，亦要补偿。在全村土地财产，平均数以下的错斗中农，要坚决补偿，未启封者退还。各村未分的果实作为补偿错斗中农的东西，对已斗之工商业资财已耗光的，贷款扶植，未分的退还。因当时干部少和领导上怕乱的错误思想，故确定区干亲自掌握有重点的进行。虽然当时的工作方针是以生产为中心结合纠偏，而问题在于我们对纠偏的意义认识不够，及只布置不督促不检查的官僚主义作风，致使这一工作未能贯彻，连基点纠偏工作也未作好，不少村的果实也未分完。仅就四区来说：作的九个村（工程、北牛叫、挑庄、大官庄、西官庄、后郝村、识村、聂庄等）中有三个村补偿了土地房屋牲口车辆，有六个村只摘了少数错斗户的帽子就算了。
    邯郸周围村庄如南北苏曹，来马台、刘二庄等村，目前仍还存在着以下问题：南苏曹剩有八户中农未补偿，韩木匠的骡子退还又牵走是事实。果实未分完并有桌凳被淋坏。新老组织矛盾没解决，支部有八个党员不作工作，不开会，支部没领导形成垮台现象。北苏曹支部长期不开会，村级组织涣散，村干工作不负责任，支应公事，纠偏仅补偿了六户，退还两户工商业，还有九户没补偿，四家被斗户要饭未安置，果实未分完。东来马台老组织被打垮，新组织未产生，区干前往该村整顿村组织时，打了挑拨新旧组织矛盾的坏分子富农卢寿山（我们已对打人的区干进行了严格的批评）。果实被偷淋坏，支部长期不开会。这足可证明党报对我们的批评基本上是正确的。以上严重问题皆出现于苏曹一带村庄，这说明我们领导作风上存在着严重的官僚主义不检查不深入，对下面混乱现象熟视无睹的自由主义。
    我们现在正进行整编党与群众的队伍，结合分果实纠偏工作，以迅速的克服村级组织混乱，和结束土改安定人心。在今后各种工作中我们并要加强苏曹一带的村庄工作。最后希望党报多多提供指导意见。

    编者意见
    对邯郸周围村庄所存在的混乱情况，已引起邯郸县委的重视，准备在整党与结束土改中求得解决，这是很好的。无疑的，这将使今后邯郸工作提高改进。希望邯郸县领导机关继续深入调查研究，发现工作中所存在的问题，正确地加以解决。同时，希望邯郸周围村庄提出意见的读者，也要改变过去对县区领导机关的某种程度上的不信任态度，积极协助县区村领导机关和干部，把村里的工作认真搞好。
    此外，本报在报导这一问题过程中，也有不尽妥善之处，这就是本报发现邯郸周围村庄存在混乱情况及邯郸县工作中某些缺点时，未能及时协同邯郸县领导机关把情况彻底闹清楚，提出解决办法。原晋冀鲁豫人民日报记者所采写之稿件，事先也未送经县委审阅，同各方多方商讨，求得共同一致意见，致使问题拖延达六月之久。这一点我们今后亦当注意改进，以树立党报正确的批评与自我批评的态度。
