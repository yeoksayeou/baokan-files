    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 29th: Telecommunication Agency Bucharest News: Since the merger of the Romanian Workers' Party from the Communist Party and the Social Democratic Party in February, the number of party members has increased to one million (the population of Romania is over fifteen million eight hundred thousand). In order to "ideologically, politically and organizationally strengthen the Party, improve the composition of the Party's leading organs, and raise the Party's political level and democratic spirit," the Party will conduct a Party rectification led by a special committee starting in December. All party members holding responsible positions in party and government organs, mass organizations, and economic life will be examined in the presence of party members and non-party masses. At the same time, the daily work of all working cadres will also be reviewed. The Party rectification is considered a milestone in the development path of the Workers' Party.
