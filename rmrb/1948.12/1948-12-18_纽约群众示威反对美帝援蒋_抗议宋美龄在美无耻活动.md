　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 15th—According to news from New York: The movement of the American people against the US government's interference in China's internal affairs continues to develop. Following the "Non-Intervention in China Conference" held in New York on the 5th of this month, on the 10th, while Truman and Song Meiling were meeting in Washington, 500 union members and students in New York held a parade and demonstration, demanding that Truman stop sending US Marines to China and stop giving any assistance to the Kuomintang government, and let the Chinese people solve the Chinese problem themselves. Demonstrators shouted slogans such as Truman "Don't interfere in China" in front of the Kuomintang's New York Consulate General, and held up signs such as: "No weapons, loans, or troops for Chiang Kai-shek!" "Less loans for the corrupt Nanjing government, more houses for the American people!" Two representatives of the Democratic Far East Policy Committee went to the Kuomintang Consulate on the fourteenth floor and gave a statement to Zhang Pingqun, the Kuomintang Consul General, protesting the Kuomintang government's anti-people policies and Song Meiling's activities in the United States.

    【新华社陕北十五日电】据纽约消息：美国人民反对美国政府干涉中国内政的运动，继续发展。继本月五日在纽约所举行的“不干涉中国大会”之后，十日，当杜鲁门与宋美龄正在华盛顿会谈之际，纽约五百名工会会员与学生又举行游行示威，要求杜鲁门停止派遣美海军陆战队赴中国，不要再给国民党政府以任何援助，让中国人民自行解决中国问题。示威者在国民党纽约总领事馆门前高呼杜鲁门“不要干涉中国”的口号，并高举如下标语：“不给蒋介石武器、贷款或军队！”“对腐败的南京政府少给一些贷款，为美国人民多造一些房屋吧！”民主远东政策委员会代表二人，亲赴十四层楼上的国民党领馆内，以声明书一件交给国民党总领事张平群，抗议国民党政府的反人民政策及宋美龄在美国的活动。
