Ten Thousand Li of Conquest on the Great Wall Line
(III) The Greatest Disaster on Earth

After our army crossed the Sanggan River, the eastern route swept across Chahar South, the western route controlled the central section of the Ping-Sui Railway, liberated Tianzhen and Yanggao, and advanced into Suiyuan. The reporter followed the army and first entered Fengzhen, the eastern gateway of Suiyuan and the third largest city in Suiyuan. The city was a scene of desolation. After investigation, it was learned that Fu's bandits had carried out a massacre when they fled, killing more than twenty innocent compatriots in one day. On the morning of the 25th, Gao Zhiyong and Kong Xianliang, two wheat-washing workers from the Minhua Rice and Flour Factory, went out to fetch water. As soon as they went out, they ran into Fu's bandits, who said they were "not good people." Before they could answer, they raised their guns and shot them dead. Then they entered the factory and ordered, "Everyone inside come out." The cook, Ma Xuetang, had just arrived in the courtyard when he was shot dead by the bandits. The peddler Cao Zhankui was standing beside his stall doing business when two of Fu's bandits came over. One said, "Watch me shoot him in both legs with one shot." With that, he shot the peddler dead. Two children playing with pigeons in the street were also used as "head targets" by the bandits, who shot them dead by the roadside, one shot each. At Yang Maosheng's house west of the station, two children were playing at the door when one was shot dead and the other wounded by Fu's bandits. When I went to Yang Maosheng's house, this middle-aged, kind urban resident was grieving over the unjust death of his seven-year-old son. He said to me, "I see my child when I close my eyes, and he disappears when I open them. When they (Fu's bandits) were here, we didn't even dare to bury the child after he died. We didn't even dare to light a lamp at night. If you light a lamp, they would say you must be communicating with the Eighth Route Army. Why aren't you sleeping?"

From Fengzhen and Liangcheng to Helingeer, we saw the greatest poverty on earth. Many peasant families had almost nothing except pots, bowls, and bellows, not even reed mats for the kang (heated brick bed). In one peasant's home, we saw a peasant woman wearing only a single layer of clothing, curled up on the kang, using her hand to smear the uneven kang with muddy water. She told us that Fu Zuoyi had robbed them of all their clothes and quilts. At night, they could only heat the kang a little, and half of their body would be cold and the other half hot, making it impossible to sleep. During the day, it was so cold that they dared not go out. In Seventh Village, Liangcheng, we heard the most tragic event on earth: Liu Sanlang's wife, who had given birth a few days earlier, was stripped of her clothes and gang-raped to death by Fu's bandits!

On April 12th, the Party, government, and military circles of the Sui-Mongolian Region sent a letter of condolence to the field army commanders and fighters and the stretcher teams participating in the war. Part of it described the suffering and hope of the people in the Sui-Mongolian Region: "After the Japanese surrendered, most of the Sui-Mongolian Region was liberated by us, and then occupied by Fu's bandits. After the Suixian campaign, Sui East and Sui South were again liberated by our army, but were again occupied by Fu's bandits in September of the previous year. During the rule of Fu's bandits, in order to suppress the people's resistance and maintain their dark rule, they arbitrarily slaughtered innocent people. For example, in Zuoyun, which has just been re-liberated this time, we found 57 dry wells and caves where the enemy buried the bodies of our compatriots. So far, 230 bodies have been retrieved from the dry wells and claimed by the masses. It is estimated that the enemy killed more than 1,000 people in total, and who knows how many more in the undiscovered places. The heinous acts of Fu and Yan's bandits have aroused irreconcilable hatred among the people. In addition, the enemy seized grain, conscripted soldiers, and extorted money, coupled with drought, leaving the masses with no food or clothing, and they are looking forward to the arrival of the People's Liberation Army to see the light of day again."

From Jinbei Datong and Huairen to Chahar South, I heard many more stories of Fu's bandits brutally killing people. In some strongholds, the bandits hung the heads of those they had killed on trees. When we passed near the Beijia Village stronghold in Yuxian County, a crooked willow tree had a human head hanging on it, tied with a hemp rope from the front eye socket, the end of the rope knotted behind the head, the face down, swaying in the cold wind. The martyr was from Mufang Village, and his name was Shi Lai. A comrade who witnessed this tragic scene said: "The victim's hair was more than an inch long, and the muscles on his face had not completely rotted, covered with patches of purplish-black blood scabs. His nose was crooked from being beaten, proving that he had suffered torture in front of the enemy, remained stubbornly unyielding, and was killed after being held for a long time." After conquering Jijiayao Village, the soldiers saw these heads and listened to the people's painful accusations, and their hearts burned with anger, determined to avenge the dead compatriots!

After liberating Chahar South, we passed through Pingxi and the Ping-Sui Railway to reach the Ji-Re-Cha area. In the Fu Zuoyi-controlled areas of Huailai and Yanqing on both sides of the Ping-Sui Railway, the people were circulating two blood-soaked sayings: "Plant trees to block the city walls, raise sons for the Da Xiang (larger administrative village), and hand over the harvested grain to the Baozhang (village head)!"

After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War in the Ji-Re-Cha area, they had finally escaped the bloody rule of the enemy and puppets, but in 1946, they suffered severe destruction from the Chiang-Fu bandit gang. The enemy's frenzied burning, killing, and destruction caused extreme terror and a severe shortage of materials. When Fu's bandits occupied Chicheng, the burden on each mu (unit of area) of nearby farmland was even as high as seven to one dan (unit of dry measure). Last winter, when the enemy "mopped up" the Tanghekou area, they stayed in Yushuwawan Village, which had twenty households, for only one night and a half day, and ate all the pigs and chickens in the village, killed seven cattle, and robbed all the grain and clothes they could take away, burning everything they could not take away.

Along the Great Wall line, we passed through the dragon head of Chahar, Chicheng, Hebei's Huairou and Miyun, and Rehe's Fengning and Chengde, and personally saw the common people generally living on melons and vegetables. They had not seen a grain of food for two or three months. Many people suffered from malnutrition due to only eating melons and vegetables, and their faces and hands were swollen. Due to the lack of labor, large areas of land were abandoned.

When we arrived at Sihaizhen in Sihai County (newly established), we were even more shocked. Hundreds of houses here were burned to the ground by Fu's bandits, and even the trees in the village were burned to death. The people pointed to the ruins and said angrily:

"The Japanese still left a few tiles, but the Kuomintang came and left a blaze of fire!"

Our army once seized a top-secret document signed and issued by Fu's bandits: "Implementation Measures for Destroying Mountain Bandit Military Bases (referring to the Liberated Areas - reporter)." This document further confirmed that Fu Zuoyi was the creator of disasters. In the document, Fu's bandits demanded the organization of looting and destruction teams, "In order not to affect troop operations and to achieve the most thorough destruction and the largest amount of looted materials in the shortest period of time, all counties close to the bandit areas should organize 'Bandit Suppression and People Rescue Looting Teams' to be led and directed by the news personnel (i.e., political workers - reporter) of each unit when our army enters the bandit military bases." The specific methods: (1) For stored grain, "The first step is to search as much as possible, conduct it separately, and concentrate it in zones; the second step is for the troops to use the search and suppression as a cover, and the 'Bandit Suppression and People Rescue Looting Teams' and all temporarily mobilized civilian labor should be directed by the news personnel to quickly transport it to pre-designated locations..." (2) For houses and livestock: "...Houses that can be used by bandits are considered to be relying on bandits and should be leveled or burned. Solid walls should be pushed down and demolished, and their foundations should be leveled so that bandits cannot repair them and their intention to return and use them is cut off." "Activate the remaining residents as much as possible to move to designated collective residential areas or merge villages and assist in the implementation." (3) For factories and water wells: "For factories, move the equipment and blow up the factory site," "Fill or blow up water wells." At the end of the document, Fu Zuoyi's bandits demanded that "The destruction must be thorough, whether it is houses, fortifications, tunnels, water wells, or other facilities. When leaving the area, personally inspect and carefully check to ensure that it meets the requirements before the task is considered complete. Those who are perfunctory and do not achieve thorough destruction will be severely punished." Their extreme insidiousness, ruthlessness, madness, and barbarity towards the people were no different from the Japanese invaders!

    万里征战长城线
    （三）人间最大的灾难
    我军渡过桑乾河后，东路横扫察南，西路控制平绥中段，解放天镇、阳高，进军绥远。记者随军首先进入绥东门户绥远第三大城丰镇，市内一片凄凉景象，经调查，才知道傅匪溃逃时曾进行大屠杀，一天之中杀了二十多个无辜的同胞。二十五这天早晨，民华米面厂的淘麦工人高志永、孔贤良二人出门打水，刚一出去碰上了傅匪，说他们“不是好人”，没等答话，端起枪来就打死他们；随后进入厂内，喝令“屋里的人都出来”，伙夫马雪堂刚到院里，又被匪徒打死；小贩曹占魁站在摊子旁边做生意，过来两个傅匪，一个说：“你看我一枪能打中他两条腿”，说着一枪把小贩打死；两个小孩在街上玩鸽子也被匪徒们当“人头靶”一枪一个打死在道旁。车站西边杨茂生家两个小孩在门口玩，被傅匪一枪打死一个，打伤一个。我到杨茂生家里去的时候，这中年的良善的城市居民，正为他七岁的爱儿的冤死而悲痛，他对我说：“我闭上眼睛就见到孩子，睁开眼睛就不见了，他们（傅匪）在时，孩子死了也不敢去埋，晚上连灯都不敢点，你要点灯他说你准是通八路，为什么不睡觉？”
    我们由丰镇、凉城到和林格尔，看见了人间最大的贫困，许多农民家里除了锅、碗和风箱，几乎一无所有，甚至连炕席都没有。在一家农民家里，我们见到一个只穿单衣的农妇，蜷缩在炕上，用手醮泥水抹凸凹不平的炕，她告诉我们：傅作义把衣服被子全抢走了，夜间只好把炕烧热一下，半个身子冷，半个身子烫的睡不着，而白天冷得不敢出门。在凉城七号村，我们又听了人间最大的惨事：农民刘三郎产后数天的妻子，被傅匪扒去衣服，轮奸而死了！
    绥蒙区我党政军各界于四月十二日给野战军指战员及参战队担架队一封慰问信，其中一部分叙述了绥蒙地区人民的苦难与希望：“绥蒙地区在日寇授降后，大部为我解放，接着又被傅匪侵占；绥县战役后，绥东绥南又为我军解放，前年九月又被傅匪侵占。在博匪统治期间，为了镇压人民的反抗，维持其黑暗的统治，任意屠杀无辜人民。象这次重获解放的左云，我们发现敌人残杀同胞掩埋尸首的枯井地洞即有五十七处，现已经从枯井打捞出的尸首，群众认领走的，已有二百卅具，估计敌人杀害的群众总在一千人以上，那些没有发现的地方还不知有多少。傅阎匪徒的凶恶行为，已引起人民不共戴天的仇恨。此外，敌人抢粮、抓丁、逼款，又加荒旱，闹得群众无衣无食，天天盼望解放军到来，得重见天日。”
    由晋北大同、怀仁到察南，我又听见了许多傅匪惨杀人民的事情。有的据点内，匪徒们把杀过的人头挂在树上，我们经过蔚县北吉家庄据点附近时，一棵弯弯的柳树上，就挂着一个人头，用一根麻绳由前眼窝处绑起来，绳头结在脑后，脸朝下在寒风中摇幌着。这位殉难者是木方村人，名字叫石来。目睹这一惨象的同志说：“被害者的头发有一寸多长，脸上的肌肉还没完全腐烂，结着一块块紫黑色的血疤，鼻子被打得歪斜着，证明他在敌人的面前，受尽了酷刑，顽强不屈，押了很久时间才被害死的。”攻克吉家庄后，战士们看到这类人头，听着人民沉痛的控拆，一个一个心里燃烧着怒火，决心为死难同胞复仇！
    解放察南后，我们由平西过平绥路，到达冀热察区。在平绥两侧怀来、延庆傅匪统治区，人民流行着两句血泪话语：“栽树挡城墙，养儿给大乡，打下粮食给保长！”
    冀热察区抗日战争胜利后，好容易摆脱了敌伪的血腥统治，但在四六年又遭受了蒋傅匪帮的严重摧残，敌人的疯狂烧杀破坏，造成了极度的恐怖与物资的奇缺。在傅匪占赤城时，附近水地每亩负担甚至多到七斗到一石。去年冬天敌“扫荡”汤河口地区时，在一个二十户的榆树湾村只住了一夜半天，便将全村的猪、鸡吃了个净光，杀了七头牛，粮食衣服能抢走的抢走，带不走的全烧毁了。
    我们沿着长城线，走过察哈尔龙头、赤城，河北的怀柔、密云及热河的丰宁、承德等地区，亲眼看到了老百姓普遍的吃瓜菜过日子，他们两三个月不见一粒粮食，很多群众因为光吃瓜菜，营养太坏，面色苍白，脸手浮肿。因为劳动力的缺乏，土地大片的荒芜了。
    我们到四海县（新设）的四海镇，更使人吃惊，这里几百间房子，被傅匪烧得荡然无存，甚至连村里的树都烧死了，老百姓指着这残墙断壁愤怒的说：
    “日本尚留几片瓦，国民党来了一火光！”
    我军曾缴获了傅匪签名颁发的极机密文件：“捣毁山地匪军根据地（指解放区——记者）实施办法”。这一文件更证实了傅作义是灾难的制造者。文件中傅匪要求组织抢掠破坏队，“为不影响部队作战，并能在最短期间破坏最为彻底，抢运最多物资，凡接近匪区之各县，均应组织‘剿匪救民抢运队’，以备我军于进剿匪军根据地时，归各该部队新闻人员（即政工人员——记者）率领指导实施之。”其具体办法：（一）对存粮“第一步尽量搜寻，分头进行，分区集中；第二步部队以搜剿代掩护下，由新闻人员指挥‘剿匪救民抢运队’及临时动员一切民力，赶速运至预先指定地点。………”（二）对房屋及牲畜：“………可资匪利用之房屋，均认为依匪附匪，应予平毁或焚毁。坚固墙壁，推倒拆毁，并铲平其根基，使匪不能修复，绝其回窜利用之念”。“尽量发动残留居民，移至指定集居区或予并村，并协助实施之。”（三）对工厂水井：“对工厂则搬走设备，炸毁厂址”，“填塞或炸塌水井”。文件的末尾，傅作义匪徒要求“从事破坏均必须彻底，无论家屋、工事、地道、水井，或其他各种设施，离开该地时，要亲自巡视，认真检查，必须合乎要求，才算达成任务，其敷衍了事破坏而未做到彻底程度者，定予严重处分。”其对人民极其阴险狠毒，狂疯野蛮的程度，与日寇何异！
