　　Kuomintang Abandons Wounded Soldiers
　　PLA Provides Careful Treatment
Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains, 10th: Nearly 400 wounded Kuomintang soldiers, injured in the recent Zhengzhou perimeter battles, have received treatment and lenient treatment from the People's Liberation Army. Since November 24th, over 370 wounded Kuomintang soldiers from the Zhengzhou perimeter battles have been successively sent to various hospitals in the city for treatment by the Zhengzhou Military Control Commission and the Municipal Government. All medical expenses are borne by the democratic government. Over 180 people have been cured and discharged from the hospital. Those who wish to return home are given travel expenses and dismissal certificates by the Garrison Command Reception Center to help them return home. Currently, there are still over 190 people receiving treatment in the hospital, and the Municipal Government has issued cotton-padded clothes to keep them warm. This is in stark contrast to the tragic situation recently reported in Tianjin Kuomintang newspapers, where thousands of wounded Kuomintang soldiers arriving in Tianjin from Jinzhou, western Liaoning, received no medical treatment, wandered the streets, had no clothes or food, and became beggars.
Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains, 12th: The 110th Division of General Liao Yunzhou, which revolted on the front lines of Huaihai, was welcomed by the military and civilians in the liberated areas. The division arrived safely in the rear of the liberated area on November 30th. The Yuwan Su Military Region specially allocated a large amount of flour to supply the division and issued consolation money to the officers and soldiers who revolted. The local people in the stationed area brought items to express their sympathy and organized stilt walkers and Yangko teams to perform in various villages where the division was stationed in turn. The officers and soldiers who revolted were filled with excitement. An adjutant in the division headquarters happily said: "The People's Liberation Army and the people are truly one family. If the Central Army came, the people would have run away long ago." An old lady next to him smiled and said: "You are different now. You have joined the People's Liberation Army, so why should we run away? The noodles you are eating today were ground by us."

　　国民党丢弃伤兵不管
  　解放军予以细心治疗
    【新华社中原十日电】前在郑州外围战役中受伤的将近四百名国民党军伤兵，受到人民解放军的治疗和宽待。从上月二十四日起，经由郑州军管会及市政府陆续分送该市各医院治疗的郑州外围战役国民党伤兵，即达三百七十余人。医药费全由民主政府负担。治愈出院者现已达一百八十余人，其中愿回家的由警备司令部收容所发给路费和遣散证，助其回家。现留院医治的还有一百九十余人，市政府均发给棉衣御寒。这与最近天津国民党报纸所报导的由辽西锦州抵达天津的数千名国民党伤兵得不到医治、流落街头、无衣无食、沦为乞丐的悲惨情景适成一鲜明对照。
    【新华社中原十二日电】在淮海前线战地举义的廖运周将军所部一百一十师，受到解放区军民的欢迎。该部于上月三十日安抵解放区后方。豫皖苏军区特拨大批面粉供给该部，并发给起义官兵慰劳费。驻地群众携带物品前往慰劳，并组织高跷及秧歌队，轮番到该部各驻村表演。起义官兵充满兴奋情绪。师部的一位副官愉快地说：“解放军和老百姓真是一家人，要是中央军来，老百姓早就跑完了。”在他身旁的一个老太太笑着说：“你们现在不同了，参加了解放军，咱们还跑什么。今天你们吃的面就是我们给磨的。”
