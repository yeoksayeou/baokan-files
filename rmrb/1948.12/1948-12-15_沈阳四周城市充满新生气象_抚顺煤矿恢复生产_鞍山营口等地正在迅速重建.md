Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, December 11th: The renowned coal-producing area of Fushun is actively recovering. The large-scale Fushun Mining Bureau is now producing as normal. The coal output of each coal mine is constantly increasing. The output of one factory has increased by two times compared to the initial liberation. The city's oil refining, cement, and chemical factories have all resumed production. More than 3,000 shops have opened, and all 38 primary and secondary schools have resumed classes. The city's postal and telecommunications are now smooth, and long-distance calls can reach Andong, Shenyang and other places. The Shenyang-Jilin railway line, which passes through Fushun, officially opened on November 17th. In order to solve the living difficulties of workers and citizens, the People's Government has successively issued ten catties of rice and 200,000 Northeast currency to each worker. The Municipal Trade Bureau sold a large amount of grain to supply citizens at low prices.

The main difficulty encountered in the recovery work in Fushun is that the city suffered severe damage during the two and a half years of the Kuomintang's occupation. The railway sleepers and rails of the mines, the steel plates, reinforcing bars and refractory bricks of the steel plants, and the cement of the cement plants were all taken by the Chiang bandit troops to build fortifications. Two of the four mines in the entire area were frequently shut down. The machinery in many factories rusted, and the factory sites became open spaces overgrown with weeds. At that time, all factories in the city, except for the power plant and the oil refinery which were still barely operating, were at a standstill. The daily coal output plummeted from 30,000 to 50,000 tons during the puppet Manchurian period to 600 to 3,000 tons. The number of employees in each factory also decreased sharply from more than 100,000 to more than 30,000, and every day more than 20,000 employees were forced by the Kuomintang to build fortifications day and night, and were frequently and massively conscripted by the Chiang bandit troops into the army. The Fushun Mining Bureau was regarded by the Kuomintang as a "lucrative post" for personal enrichment. The second director, Xie Shuying, came empty-handed and left with more than 50 catties of pure gold. The more these robbers made a fortune, the poorer Fushun became. The wounds inflicted on Fushun by the Kuomintang bandit gang cannot, of course, be completely restored in the short term, but the workers of Fushun and the People's Government of Fushun have the confidence to make this injured city better day by day through joint efforts.

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, December 11th: The cities surrounding Shenyang after liberation are full of new vitality. When Tieling was liberated, all the telephones in the city were intact. Long-distance telephone and telegraph services were fully operational within a week after liberation. All twelve primary and secondary schools in the city have resumed classes. More than 500 people have registered for the short-term training courses opened by the government for young intellectuals. Anshan, which was once occupied by the Chiang bandits, is being rebuilt. The employees of the city's power bureau bravely protected the substation before the recapture and actively rushed to repair the lines after the recapture, immediately restoring power supply. The recovery work in Liaoyang City is also progressing rapidly. Public and private factories such as paper mills, iron factories, and rice mills have resumed production. Citizens are actively collecting various materials and donating parts to help the factories resume work. All primary and secondary schools in the city have resumed classes. Yingkou City, which was re-occupied by the Chiang bandits for nine days, has now returned to its original appearance. The railway between the city and Shenyang is now clear.

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, December 12th: Thanks to the day-and-night efforts of all railway employees, the main railway lines radiating from Shenyang to the surrounding areas have now mostly resumed operation. As of November 27th, the Shenyang-Jilin, Shenyang-Andong, and Shenyang-Fushun lines have all officially handled passenger and freight transportation. In the repair work, railway employees created many brilliant examples. As soon as the battle to liberate Shenyang ended, workers from the Harbin Railway Bureau and newly liberated workers began to work shoulder to shoulder. They urgently dispersed freight cars to avoid enemy bombing under extremely difficult conditions where there was no supply of water, electricity, or coal. Drivers Yang Guantang, Xia Xiaozhen, and others lit the locomotives and worked hard all night, completing the original task in one night. Zhang Shirong, a worker at the dispatching station, regardless of the fatigue of the long march, persisted for several consecutive nights, dealing with frequent vehicle scheduling and demonstrating a high degree of responsibility. Under constant enemy air raids, the workers repaired all the railway telephone lines near Shenyang within three days. In particular, the 4th Detachment of the Engineering Team of the Railway Department of the Northeast Administrative Committee and the employees of the Jilin Railway Bureau completed the original 25-day task in 15 days, repairing more than 200 kilometers of railway line from Shenyang to Hailong. Among them, the bridge brigade repaired a total of eleven large and small bridges. Within one day and night, they repaired a large bridge that required 14,000 sleepers. The technical team used manual pile driving, reaching a rate of 35 hammer blows per person per minute, and driving a pile in just ten minutes. The wooden bridge team had dozens of employees braving the cold to build bridges in the river. The track team relied entirely on manual labor to carry track timbers, and in one night, more than 200 people carried more than 4,000 track timbers, setting a record of transporting them over four kilometers.

Xinhua News Agency, Chengde, December 12th: After the liberation of Shanhaiguan, a key transportation hub inside and outside the customs, a revolutionary order has been established. The Military Control Commission is leading the people to carry out various recovery tasks. The workers of the electric light factory restored the city's electric lights on the day of the city's liberation. The workers of the telephone bureau also repaired the city's telephones within two days. Currently, Shanhaiguan Middle School, Women's Simple Normal School, and six primary schools have resumed classes, and other schools are also actively recovering. Large and small shops in the city have opened for business. Personnel from the original Kuomintang agencies are flocking to the People's Government to register and report.

    沈阳四周城市充满新生气象
    抚顺煤矿恢复生产
    鞍山营口等地正在迅速重建
    【新华社沈阳十一日电】著名产煤区抚顺正在积极恢复中。规模宏大的抚顺矿务局现已照常生产。各煤山的产煤量正在不断提高。其中某厂的产量，已比初解放时增加了两倍。市内制油、洋灰、化学等工厂，均已恢复生产。三千多家商店已开业，三十八所中小学已全部复课。现全市邮电畅通，长途电话可达安东、沈阳等地。途经抚市的沈吉线铁路，已于十一月十七日正式通车。人民政府为解决工人及市民的生活困难，已先后发给每个工人十斤大米，二十万元东北币。市贸易局以低价售出大批粮食供应市民。
    抚顺的恢复工作所遇到的主要困难，就是该市在国民党侵占两年半中，曾受到了严重摧残。矿山的铁路枕木和铁轨，炼钢厂的钢板、铁筋和耐火砖，洋灰厂的洋灰，都被蒋匪军拿去修筑了工事。全区四个矿山，就有两个经常停工。很多工厂的机器生了锈，厂址变成旷场，生满了野草。那时，全市工厂，除发电厂和制油厂还勉强开工外，其余各厂均陷于停顿中。煤产量每天由伪满时的三万至五万吨锐减到六百至三千吨。各厂职工数，也由十余万人激减到三万余人，且每天还有两万个职工被国民党胁迫去日夜修筑工事，经常地大批地被蒋匪军抓去当兵。抚顺矿务局被国民党当作个人发财的“肥缺”。第二任局长谢树英，来时两手空空，去时赤金就带了五十多斤。这些强盗们愈是发财，抚顺就愈是穷困。国民党匪帮所加于抚顺的创伤，当然不能希望在短期内完全复原，但是抚顺的职工和抚顺的人民政府，却有信心以共同的努力使这个受伤的城市一天比一天更好。
    【新华社沈阳十一日电】解放后的沈阳四围各城市，充满新生气象。铁岭光复时，市内电话全部完好无损。长途电话、电报于解放后一周内完全畅通。全市十二所中小学已全部复课。政府为青年知识分子所开办的短期训练班，已有五百余人报名。一度为蒋匪窜陷的鞍山，正在重建中。该市电业局职工，在这次收复前曾英勇地保护变电所，收复后又积极赶修各线路，立刻恢复送电。辽阳市恢复工作也进行得很快。造纸厂、铁工厂、磨米厂等公私工厂已恢复生产。市民正积极收集各种器材，献出零件，帮助各工厂复工。市内中小学已全部复课。曾被蒋匪重占九天的营口市，现已恢复原来面貌。该市与沈阳之间的铁路已畅通。
    【新华社沈阳十二日电】在全体铁路员工夜以继日的突击赶修下，从沈阳向四周辐射的各主要铁路线现已大部通车。迄十一月二十七日止，沈——吉（林），沈——安（东），沈——抚（顺）等线，均已正式办理客货运输。在修复工作中，铁路员工曾创造了许多光辉的范例。当解放沈阳之战刚一结束，自哈尔滨铁路局来的工人和新解放的工人即并肩开始工作。他们在还没有水、电、煤供应的极端困难条件下，紧急疏散货车，以免敌机轰炸。司机杨关堂、夏宵桢等将机车升好火，即通宵苦干，于一夜间完成了原定任务。调度所工人张世荣，不顾长途行军的疲劳，曾连续坚持几个通宵，应付频繁的车辆调度，发挥了高度的责任心。在敌机不断空袭下工人们在三天之内全部修好了沈阳附近的铁路电话线。特别是东北行政委员会铁道部工程队四支队与吉林铁路局员工，在十五天内即完成了原订二十五天的任务，修复了自沈阳至海龙间二百余公里的铁路线。其中桥梁大队共修复大小桥十一座。在一昼夜内，他们修复了一座共需一万四千根枕木的大桥。技术中队用人工打桩，达到每人每分钟打三十五锤，十分钟即打桩一根的速率。木桥中队曾有数十员工不顾寒冷，下河搭桥。线路大队完全靠人工扛道木，一夜内曾达到二百多人扛道木四千多根，运送四公里的纪录。
    【新华社承德十二日电】关内外交通要地山海关解放后，革命秩序已建立。军事管制委员会正领导人民进行各项恢复工作。电灯厂工人于该城解放当日即恢复了城区电灯。电话局工人，也在两天内修复了全城电话。现山海关中学，女子简易师范及六所小学已复课，其他学校也正在积极恢复中。城内大小商店已开业。原国民党各机关人员，正纷纷前往人民政府登记、报到。
