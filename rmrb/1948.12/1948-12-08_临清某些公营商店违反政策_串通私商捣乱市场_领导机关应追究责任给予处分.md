　　Due to the lack of discipline and governmental oversight in certain state-owned shops in Linqing, and their pursuit of profit, the market in Linqing was once thrown into chaos. Relevant Party and government leading bodies should conduct strict inspections, criticism, and disciplinary actions. In mid-to-late October, the price of cotton in Linqing experienced a dramatic fluctuation, with the rate of increase unprecedented in recent years. From October 9th to October 26th, within 18 days, the price of cotton rose by over 57%. Due to the irregular rise in cotton prices, speculators engaged in large-scale activities, adulterating and adding water to the cotton, resulting in a rapid decline in quality. Some even added 15 to 20 jin of water to every 100 jin of cotton. Although there were some objective reasons for this cotton price fluctuation, and the state-owned Hua Mao Company initially abandoned its leadership in the market, and the Bureau of Industry and Commerce did not provide effective management of the market, the direct and important reason was the unscrupulous competition among state-owned shops to purchase cotton. According to statistics, over twenty state-owned, public-owned, and institutional production shops from areas such as Central Hebei, Hebei-Shandong-Henan, Bohai, Jiaodong, and Southern Hebei were purchasing cotton in large quantities in Linqing at that time. The cotton in the market was not enough for them to purchase, so they went to the countryside and nearby towns to search for it. Not satisfied with buying it themselves, they also entrusted private merchants to purchase on their behalf in large quantities. Private merchants took this opportunity to adulterate the cotton with water and engage in other tricks to profit. When the private merchant Wan Ju Da Flower Shop was purchasing on behalf of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan state-owned shop De Feng Yu, they added so much water that water could be squeezed out when packing. Another Hebei-Shandong-Henan state-owned shop, Tai Xing Long, entrusted Wu He and two other flower shops to purchase on their behalf. In order to earn more commission, Wu He further entrusted Heng Man and three other flower shops to collect the cotton. Heng Man, for the same purpose, further entrusted Long Tai Flower Shop to collect the cotton. Because Long Tai Flower Shop had even greater speculative intentions, it "willingly" acted as a third-level intermediary. For example, Heng Man Flower Shop received six jin of bundling hemp rope from Wu He, then added mud and water to the rope to increase its weight to ten jin before sending it to Long Tai. When Long Tai was bundling the cotton, it gradually mixed in over 3,000 jin of red cotton that it had stored, and handed over the best-quality cotton. In this way, Long Tai "ate" Heng Man, Heng Man "ate" Wu He, and Wu He "ate" Tai Xing Long. In reality, it was the speculators who united to take advantage of Tai Xing Long. In the end, the public suffered losses, while the speculators profited. According to rough estimates, during the cotton price fluctuation period, the various state-owned shops purchased approximately 1.5 million jin of cotton lint. At the lowest estimate of an average of ten jin of moisture per hundred jin, a total of 150,000 jin of water was purchased, which would require Jibi 300 million yuan, based on the price before the cotton price began to fluctuate – 2,035 yuan per jin. What is particularly serious is that after the North China Government issued the order on the 20th stating that "state-owned shops in various regions are not allowed to directly purchase cotton in Linqing City; if needed, the local state-owned shops can purchase it on their behalf," some state-owned shops still secretly purchased cotton through private merchants, defying the orders of the higher-level government. Such a disregard for the overall situation, collusion with private merchants to speculate and engage in deceptive practices, and defiance of government orders, creating chaos in the market, are serious acts of anarchy and indiscipline on the part of the Linqing state-owned trading departments. They should conduct a thorough self-criticism, and those responsible should be investigated and receive appropriate punishment.

　　临清某些公营商店违反政策
  　串通私商捣乱市场
    领导机关应追究责任给予处分
    【本报讯】记者田流报导：由于某些公营商店无纪律无政府，唯利是图，曾造成临清市场一度紊乱，有关党政领导机关，应给予严格的检查批评与纪律处分。十月中下旬，临清市棉价有一次剧烈的波动，上升速度之快，为近数年来所未有，从十月九日到二十六日的十八天内，棉上涨了百分之五十七强，由于棉价无规律地跃进地升涨，投机商人大肆活动，掺假使水，棉花质量迅速下降，甚至每百斤花有使十五斤到二十斤水者。这次棉价波动，虽有一些客观原因，以及开始时国营华茂公司放弃了对市场的领导，工商局没有对市场给予有效的管理，但直接的、重要的原因，却是公营商店间不择手段的互相争购。据统计，当时在临清大批抢购棉花的有冀中、冀鲁豫、渤海、胶东及冀南等区的国营、公营、机关生产商店二十余家。他们市场上的棉花不够他们抢购，便纷纷到乡下和附近的各城镇去搜购，自己买尤嫌不足，又大量的委托私商代购，私商则趁此机会掺假使水捣鬼渔利。私商万聚大花店在替冀鲁豫国营商店德丰裕代购时，因使水太多，打包时竟能压出水来；冀鲁豫另一国营商店泰兴隆，委托五和等两花店代购，五和为更多的赚手续费，又转委托恒满等三花店代收，恒满为了同样的目的再委托隆泰花店代收，而隆泰花店因为有更高的投机目的，也“甘愿”挂第三秤，这些被委托的私人花店，如恒满花店，从五和领来六斤重的扎包麻绳，再把麻绳滚泥使水加重到十斤重发给隆泰，隆泰在扎花包时便陆续地把自己预存的三千多斤红花掺进去，顶好花交走。这样一来，便是隆泰“吃”恒满，恒满“吃”五和，五和“吃”泰兴隆，其实是投机商联合起来吃泰兴隆，闹来闹去公家吃亏，投机商渔利。据粗略统计，此次棉价波动期内，各公营商店收购棉绒约百五十万斤，以最低估计每百斤平均十斤潮计共买水十五万斤，就用棉价开始波动前的价格——每斤二○三五元计算，也需冀币三万万数千万元。尤其严重的，是华北政府关于“各区公营商店，不许在临清市直接购买棉花，如有需要，可由当地国营商店代购”的命令，于二十日下达后，有的公营商店，尚利用私商出头，暗暗的偷购，不执行上级政府的命令。临清各公营国营贸易部门这样的不顾大局，串通私商投机捣鬼，违抗政府命令，造成市场的紊乱，严重的无政府无纪律行为，应进行深刻的检讨，并追查责任，受到应有处分。
