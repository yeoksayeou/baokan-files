　　Organizing Supply and Marketing to Support Handicraft Industry
　　Hejian and Other Counties in Central Hebei Clarify the Direction of Cooperative Work
　　[Central Hebei News] The Eighth Sub-district of Central Hebei (including Hejian, Renqiu, and other counties) recently held a production meeting to review the work of production promotion cooperatives in various counties and determine the direction of future work. It was first pointed out that although the promotion cooperatives in various counties had made great achievements during the autumn harvest and wheat planting, there were still many shortcomings and biases in their work. Some cadres still hold the mistaken view of underestimating promotion cooperatives, and some county committees and county governments do not pay attention to the leadership of promotion cooperatives, and even borrow money from them, which affects the support for mass production. As for the promotion cooperatives themselves, they neglect the restoration and rectification of village cooperatives, blindly operate, and simply seek profits, so they have suffered considerable losses in developing business and supporting mass production. In order to correct the above shortcomings and biases and further support the masses in carrying out winter production, clear regulations have been made on the direction of future work: (1) In areas with a foundation in handicrafts, the main focus is on supporting and driving the production of sideline industries such as textiles, oil, mat weaving, flour production, transportation, and saltpeter; followed by weaving. The focus of business operations is to supply raw materials and solve the difficulties of product sales. The processing of homespun cloth should be carried out in a planned and focused manner to improve quality and reduce costs. Regarding saltpeter: in areas with an existing foundation for boiling saltpeter, quality should be improved; in areas that produce saltpeter but lack saltpeter boiling technology, technicians should be organized to provide guidance and gradually develop it; and difficulties such as fuel and daily necessities for saltpeter producers should be resolved. Especially in flood-stricken areas, it should be earnestly ensured that through business, the business of village cooperatives and mass mutual aid production are brought about, funds are raised for operation, and loans are provided for support when necessary, to achieve the widespread development of various kinds of cooperatives (especially supply and marketing cooperatives). (2) Vigorously organize mass transportation and sales. To this end, transportation cooperatives and stations should be established in a planned manner to facilitate the development of the transportation industry. (3) In order to truly support winter production, it is first necessary to correct the thinking of cadres, pay attention to the work of promotion cooperatives, and correct the blind operation and pure profit-seeking view.

　　组织供销扶助手工业
    冀中河间等县明确推进社工作方向
    【冀中讯】冀中八分区（包括河间、任邱等县）于最近召开生产会议，对各县生产推进社工作作了检讨，并确定了今后工作方向。首先指出：各县推进社虽在秋收种麦中已有很大成绩，但在工作中仍有不少缺点与偏向。有些干部仍存在着轻视推进社的错误观点，有的县委与县政府不重视推进社的领导，甚至向推进社借款，影响了对群众生产的扶植。而推进社本身呢？则忽视恢复与整顿村社，盲目经营，单纯营利，因而在发展业务和扶植群众生产上，也受到了相当损失。为了纠正上述缺点和偏向，进一步扶植群众开展冬季生产，对今后工作方向作了明确规定：（一）在手工业有基础的地区，主要是扶持带动纺织、油、席、粉、运输、火硝等副业生产；其次是编织业。业务经营的中心，是供给原料，解决成品销路等困难。对土布应有计划有重点的进行整庄，提高质量降低成本。火硝方面：在已有熬硝基础地区、应提高质量；在产硝而无熬硝技术的地区，应组织有技术的去指导，逐步发展起来；并解决硝民烧柴用品等困难。特别在水灾区，应切实作到通过业务，带起村社业务和群众互助生产，集资经营，必要时予以贷款扶持，达到广泛的发展各种各样的合作社（尤其是供销社）。（二）大力组织群众运输运销。为此应有计划的建立运输合作社和站，以利运输业的开展。（三）为了真正作到扶持冬季生产，首先应打通干部思想，重视推进社工作，纠正盲目经营单纯营利观点。
