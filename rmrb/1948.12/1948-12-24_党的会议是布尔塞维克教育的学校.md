Party Meetings are Schools of Bolshevik Education
    By Banfuluofu, Secretary of the Moscow District Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) in Leningrad

    Party meetings are the highest organs of the Party's grassroots organizations and also schools of Bolshevik education. Party meetings can ideologically arm Communist Party members, enhance their initiative and unity, increase their sense of organizational responsibility, and make each member feel that he is part of a unified organization.

    The District Committee should pay close attention to the preparation and conduct of Party meetings. The District Committee should promote the initiative and spontaneity of Party organizations in raising questions, and should not use questions raised by higher authorities to dictate the agenda of all Party meetings. If the agenda only contains issues instructed by higher authorities, it will bureaucratize the conduct of Party meetings.

    Party meetings held in many organizations have aroused great interest among Communist Party members in the following issues: namely, "Lenin and Stalin's theories on building a communist society in our country," "Lenin and Stalin on socialist competition and the speed of production development," and "On the communist education of workers and the struggle against capitalist remnants in people's minds." These meetings have been so effective because they were well prepared in advance. The District Committee assigned many well-educated comrades to give reports.

    Careful preparation for these meetings can turn them into major events in the life of the Party organization, which are anticipated and of utmost concern to Communist Party members. These meetings can have a significant impact on the work of the Party organization, promote a surge in national production, increase Communist Party members' interest in theoretical syntheses of their actual work experience, and help to enhance the vanguard role of Party members in production and social life in many ways.

    During the preparation for the meetings, the ideological education work of Party organizations obviously became more active. Group and individual discussions were conducted, and book and newspaper exhibitions were organized. In preparing for the discussions on Lenin and Stalin's theories on building a communist society in our country, Party members of the Lenin Meat Packing Plant read many Marxist-Leninist classics on this issue, as well as articles in magazines and newspapers. The Party organization of the Yegorov Wagon Manufacturing Plant held preliminary talks with Party members and probationary members who were less well-versed in theory. At the Second "Proletarian Victory" Shoe Factory, an inter-factory Party meeting was held before the general assembly.

    The fact that more than 800 people signed up to speak at the conference and raised 790 questions proves the enthusiasm of the Party members. Based on this experience, the District Committee introduced some supplementary topics for discussion to the various Party organizations.

    Meetings to discuss Lenin and Stalin's theories on socialist competition and the speed of production development were also meticulously prepared. The discussion of this issue at the Party meetings further promoted the scope of competition and corrected shortcomings in its organization. The Kirov "Electricity" Factory held a well-organized and solemn general assembly. To prepare materials for the general assembly, the Party committee attracted many Party members familiar with the organization of socialist competition in the enterprise. Before the meeting, many magazines, newspapers, and wall newspapers were published, and exhibitions were organized, using charts and banners to illustrate the work of the factory and individual workshops. All Party members were notified in advance of the general assembly and the agenda. To implement the decisions of the meeting, Party members also actively strived to achieve new quotas and mobilize all workers to complete the plan ahead of schedule.

    For the convening of the Party meeting, the wall newspaper of the Asbestos Factory published a special issue that day. In the factory's assembly hall were hung slogans calling for the completion of one's assigned tasks and organized honor blackboards (with photos of outstanding Stakhanovite workers). During the preparation for the meeting, Communist Party members took on new and greater tasks; in many production departments, the labor productivity of workers increased significantly.

    During the preparation for the meeting, Party members carefully studied Lenin and Stalin's instructions on socialist competition. Many Party members of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) read Lenin's great works "A Great Beginning" and "The Immediate Tasks of the Soviet Government," Comrade Stalin's speech at the First All-Union Conference of Stakhanovites, and others.

    At the Party organization meetings of the Coal Gasification Plant, the "Red Tailor" Factory, and the First Municipal Power Plant, Party members in their speeches were able to link Lenin and Stalin's principles on socialist competition with the actual work of the enterprise.

    Timely and serious preparation, and the active participation of all Party members, promoted the smooth conduct of these general assemblies. These meetings helped to educate each Party member to have a high sense of responsibility for the work of the enterprise and the work of the Party organization. At the first general assembly on socialist competition, the District Committee invited the secretaries of other Party organizations to participate, so that they could learn from the good experience and point out the shortcomings in the preparation and conduct of Party branch general assemblies.

    The decisions adopted by the general assembly played an important role in improving the enterprise and organizing competition work. Based on the suggestions of Party members, the Lenin Meat Packing Plant established an office for rationalizers and inventors. To implement the decisions of the general assembly, the Party organization of the Guo Nieshen Tram Depot helped the management to establish a technical research office and adjust its work.

    Based on the opinions of Party members, the District Committee convened a meeting of Stakhanovite workers who had completed the annual plan. The meeting helped Party leaders to establish closer ties with the advanced elements in the district, reveal existing shortcomings, and mobilize all workers to intensify their efforts to overcome shortcomings.

    Currently, more than 4,000 workers in the district have completed their annual production quotas. Some of them have completed the quotas for the five-year plan. Among the production innovators who have already started working on the 1950-1951 plans are Comrade Guo Ziluofu, a model worker at the "Electricity" Factory and a deputy to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, and Mikhailovsky, an outstanding Stakhanovite worker at the "Rapid Progress" Factory and a probationary member of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks). Recently, more than 300 advanced work teams have been awarded the honorary title of "30th Anniversary of the October Revolution Work Team."

    Not long ago, a Party meeting was held here to discuss the issue of "On the communist education of workers and the struggle against capitalist remnants in people's minds." Why choose such an agenda for the meeting? Because among us, there are still many phenomena such as some people always trying to pay less to the state and get more from the state. There are also greedy people in production, loafers, and wasters. And among some intellectuals, there is still blind worship of foreign things to this day. Party organizations must wage a resolute struggle against these remnants of the past.

    In the "Rapid Progress" Factory, in addition to those examples of selfless labor, there are still some workers (including individual Communist Party members) who treat labor with a non-communist attitude. Speakers sharply criticized the shortcomings of the Party Committee and the factory Party organization in mass work and political work. The reasons hindering the improvement of the political and ideological work level of Party members and non-Party members were revealed.

    The District Committee and the grassroots Party organizations hope that every Party meeting will educate Communist Party members and make them feel the strength of the organization. This is especially important for Party organizations, most of whose members are new and lack ideological training. That is why we must pay more attention to the preparation and conduct of Party meetings.

    However, some Party leaders are not serious about this work. We still have the fact that meetings are not held regularly. This often happens wherever the leaders of the Party organization do not understand that there is no Party work without Party meetings.

    Sometimes, little attention is also paid to the preparation of meetings. For example, the District Party Committee recently canceled a meeting of a Party organization whose secretary was Comrade Shugen. This was because Party members did not receive notice of the meeting on time, and the venue was not prepared. As a result, only one-tenth of the Party members arrived at the scheduled time. The draft resolution was prepared just before the meeting. All of this was reflected in the lack of enthusiasm and self-criticism in the discussion. After pointing out the mistakes of the factory Party committee, the District Committee ordered them to convene a new meeting.

    Or take the issue of the leadership of the meeting as an example. We often see that the same Party members always preside over the meeting. The same is true for giving reports. For example, at the twelve meetings held at the Coking Gas Factory, the reports were always given by the Party organization's secretary, deputy secretary, and the factory director. At the Lenin Refrigerated Joint Factory, the reporter is always the secretary of the Party organization himself.

    Individual Party leaders sometimes try to plan the entire meeting process in advance: who will speak on which issues, who will preside over the meeting. They forget that such a meeting is of little benefit, will not give play to the enthusiasm of Party members, and will only lower the level of self-criticism.

    The District Committee and the lower-level Party organizations strive to make Party meetings a school for cultivating discipline. We require Party leaders to pay attention to the phenomenon of Party members being absent and to criticize this phenomenon every time, so that they understand that complying with the requirements of the Party Constitution is based on Party discipline.

    It is also very important to notify Party members in a timely manner how the decisions of the meeting are implemented. We do this so that the secretary of the Party organization can report on how the decisions of the previous meeting were implemented at the Party's regular meetings, and to call together those Party members who were unable to attend the general assembly and notify them of the decisions of the meeting. A meeting that is very active when discussing issues but delays the adoption of decisions until an indefinite time is absolutely not allowed. Of course, such a decision will lose its effect and sharpness.

    There are also cases where the political and ideological level of the meeting is very low, the meeting rarely discusses the actual problems of Party life, does not talk to Party members about the purpose and tasks of the general assembly, and does not guide the broad masses of Party members to participate in the preparation for the meeting. The report must not only be limited to the secretary of the Party organization and the factory director, but must also involve the broadest masses of Party activists.

    The District Party Committee should systematically summarize meeting experience, help lower-level Party leaders choose issues to discuss at meetings, introduce how to better prepare for meetings, and discuss what the nature of the resolutions should be.

    Large meetings occupy an important position in the Bolshevik education of Party members. Active discussion of issues and adoption of decisions at the general assembly can promote the realization of the basic task—completing the second year of the post-war five-year plan ahead of schedule.

                                                                           (Translated by Ren Fei from Pravda)

### 党的会议是布尔塞维克教育的学校

　　党的会议是布尔塞维克教育的学校
    列宁格勒市联共（布）党莫斯科区区委书记  班弗洛夫作
    党的会议是党的基层组织之最高机关，同时也是布尔塞维克教育的学校。党的会议可以从思想上武装共产党员，提高他们的积极性和团结性，提高党员对组织的责任感，并可以使每个党员感觉到，他是统一的组织中的一分子。
    区党委应认真注意筹备和进行党的会议的问题。区党委应发扬党组织提问题的主动性与自动性，而不应拿上级所提出的问题去规定一切党的会议的议事日程。若在议事日程中仅只提出上级指示的问题那就会使党的会议的进行官僚化。
    在许多组织中所进行的党的会议，使共产党员对下列问题发生了很大的兴趣：此即“列宁、斯大林关于在我国建设共产主义社会的学说”，“列宁、斯大林论社会主义竞赛与生产发展的速度”，“论对劳动者的共产主义教育和反对人们意识中的资本主义残余的斗争”。这些会议之所以收到如此效果是因为事前都有充分的准备。区党委分配了很多有修养的同志作报告。
    仔细的准备这些会议，就可以使这些会议变成党组织生活中的重大事件，而这些事件乃是共产党员所期待和最关心的。这些会议可以给党的组织工作以重大影响，促进全国生产的高涨，提高共产党员对自己实际工作经验作理论的综合研究的兴趣，并在许多方面帮助提高党员在生产与社会生活中的先锋作用。
    在会议筹备过程中间的党组织对共产党员思想教育工作显然活跃起来了。进行了小组和个别谈话，组织了书报展览会。在准备讨论会，讨论列宁和斯大林关于在我国建设共产主义社会的学说时，列宁肉食联合工厂的党员，曾读了许多马列主义关于这问题的古典著作，杂志报章上关于这问题的论文。耶果罗夫车箱制造厂党的组织曾与修养较差的党员及候补党员进行事先谈话。在第二“无产阶级胜利”鞋工厂则于全体大会前举行厂间党的会议。
    愿意在大会上发言签名者已达八百多人，并提出七百九十个问题，这一事实证明党员的积极性。区党委根据此项经验，便给各个党组织介绍了些座谈的补充题目。
    讨论列宁和斯大林论社会主义竞赛与生产发展速度的学说的会议，也作了缜密的准备。在党的会议上，这个问题的讨论更广泛促进了竞赛范围，以及纠正其组织内的缺点。基洛夫“电力”工厂有组织和郑重地开过了大会。党委为准备大会的材料起见，曾吸引了许多熟习企业中的社会主义竞赛组织的党员参加。开会前夕刊行许多杂志报章和墙报，组织展览会，在图表和横布联上说明工厂与个别厂间的工作情形。关于开大会及会议日程都预先通知了全体党员。为执行会议决定，党员还须积极进行为达到新定额和动员全体工人提前完成计划而奋斗。
    石绵工厂为了召开党的会议，那天工厂墙报会出刊了一张专号。在工厂的大会礼堂内挂有标语口号，号召完成自己所担负的任务，组织荣誉黑板报（贴有优秀的斯达汉诺夫运动者照片）。筹备会议时共产党员担负着新的、更大的任务；在许多生产部门中工人的劳动生产率大大增加了。
    党员于筹备会议期间，曾细心地研究了列宁和斯大林论社会主义竞赛的指示。联共（布）许多党员阅读了列宁巨著“伟大的开端”，“苏维埃政权的当前任务”，斯大林同志在第一次全苏联斯达汉诺夫工作者会议上的演说以及其它等等。
    在炭气化工厂，“红色裁缝师”工厂，第一市立发电所的各个党的组织会议上，党员们在其发言中已会把列宁、斯大林论社会主义竞赛的原理同企业的实际工作联系起来。
    适合时宜而严肃的准备了工作，全体党员群众都积极的参加大会工作，促进了这些大会的顺利进行。这些会议帮助教育了每个党员对企业工作和党的组织工作高度责任感。在第一届关于社会主义竞赛大会上，区委邀请其他党组织的书记参加，为让他们能够吸取优良经验并能指出筹备及进行党支部大会中的缺点。
    大会所通过之决定对改善企业和组织竞赛工作起了重要作用。列宁肉食联合工厂根据党员的建议为实行合理化的人以及发明者成立了办公室。为了实现大会之决定，郭涅深电车库的党组织帮助经营者建立技术研究室和调整其工作。
    区党委根据党员意见，召开了完成一年计划的斯达汉诺夫工作人员会议。该会议帮助党的领导者同本区的先进者建立更密切的联系，揭发现存缺点，且动员全体劳动者加紧克服缺点。
    目前该区已有四千多工人已完成了一年的生产定额。其中有些人已完成了五年计划的定额。在已着手一九五○——一九五一年的工作的生产革新者中间，有“电力”工厂的模型制造工人苏联最高苏维埃代表郭茨洛夫同志，和“疾行”工厂的优秀斯达汉诺夫式的工作者联共（布）候补党员米海洛夫斯基。最近有三百多先进的工作队已荣膺“十月革命三十周年工作队”光荣称号。
    不久前在这里曾举行了党的会议，讨论了“关于对劳动者的共产主义教育和为反对人们意识中的资本主义残余而斗争”的问题。根据什么选择这样的会议日程呢？因为在我们中间还存在着许多这样的现象，即有些人总企图少给国家缴纳些，而自己从国家手中多得些。还有在生产上的贪婪者，二流子以及浪费者。而部分知识分子中间直到现在尚存在着对外国事物盲目的崇拜。党组织必须同这些过去的残余作坚决的斗争。
    “疾行”工厂中除去那些奋不顾身的劳动实例外，还有部分工人（其中也有个别的共产党员）是以非共产主义态度对待劳动的。发言者尖锐地批评党委会及厂间党组织在群众工作与政治工作中的缺点。揭发了有碍于提高党员和非党员政治思想工作水平的原因。
    区党委和党的基层组织希望每一个党的会议要教育共产党员，使他们感觉到组织的力量。这对于那些大部分是新党员，而在思想上缺乏锻炼的党的组织，尤为重要。这就是我们为什么一定要更加注意准备和进行党的会议之原因所在。
    但有些党的领导者对这项工作是不认真的。我们还有不定期召开会议的事实。凡是党组织的领导者不懂得没有党的会议便没有党的工作的地方，便经常发生这种情形。
    有时也很少注意会议的准备工作。如不久前区党委会曾取消了以舒根同志为书记的某个党组织的会议。——因为党员没按时接到开会的通知，开会地点也没有准备好，所以到规定的时间仅来了十分之一的党员。临开会前才准备决议草案，这一切都表现在讨论会进行的不起劲和缺乏自我批评上。区党委于指出工厂党委的错误后，便责成他们从新召开会议。
    或者再拿——关于会议的领导机构问题作例吧。我们时常看到老是那些党员主持会议。作报告也是如此。比如，在焦炭瓦斯工厂所举行的十二次会议上都是党组织的正副书记，和厂长作报告。在列宁冷藏联合工厂的报告者总是党组织的书记个人发言。
    个别党的领导者有时企图将整个会议过程提早就拟出来了：谁讲那些问题，谁主持会议，他就忘掉这种会议没什么益处，不会发挥党员的积极性，只会降低自我批评水准。
    区委和下级党组织竭力想使党会议成为培养纪律的学校。我们要求党的领导者一定注意党员缺席的现象，并每次都要给这种现象以批评，让他们了解遵守党章的要求是基于党的纪律之上的。
    及时通知党员，会议决定是如何实现的，也是很重要的。我们这样作，是为了使党组织的书记在党的例会上汇报上次会议决定是如何实现的，是为的要他们召集那些未能出席大会的党员，并通知他们关于会议的决定。一个会议当讨论问题时却很积极，而通过决定时便拖延到不定的时间那是绝不容许的。当然，这样的决定会失掉其效果和尖锐性的。
    还有这样的情形，即会议的政治思想水平很低，会议上很少讨论党的生活实际问题，不同党员谈论大会的目的和任务，不引导广大的党员群众参加会议的准备工作。作报告必须不仅限于党组织书记，厂长，而要使最广大的党的积极分子参加。
    区党委会应该有系统的总结会议经验，帮助下级党领导者选择会议上讨论的问题，介绍如何更好的筹备会议，商量决议的性质应当是怎样的。
    大的会议是在布尔塞维克教育党员中占着重要的地位。在大会上积极讨论问题，通过决定，可以促使基本任务——提前完成战后五年计划的第二年计划的实现。
