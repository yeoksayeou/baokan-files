	The Heroic Struggle of the Indonesian People

	Three hundred and fifty-one years ago, the Indonesian people began to suffer from the aggression and enslavement of Dutch imperialism. Throughout this long period, the Indonesian people have continuously waged heroic struggles of resistance. Since the establishment of the Indonesian Communist Party in 1921, the Indonesian people have had strong leadership, and new developments have taken place in the struggle against Dutch imperialism. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, during the Japanese occupation, the Indonesian Communist Party organized the People's Anti-Japanese Army to fight against Japan. After Japan surrendered, Indonesia declared its independence and established the Republic of Indonesia, putting an end to the past 350 years of enslavement. However, shortly after Japan's surrender, in October 1945, the troops of British and Dutch imperialism successively invaded Indonesia, retained Japanese troops to suppress the Indonesian people, and continued to enslave them. Thus, the Indonesian Communist Party led the people to rise up again to wage a new war of self-defense and liberation. Because the Dutch imperialists' economy could not support their war of aggression, and because of the growth of the Indonesian Communist Party and the people's strength, the Dutch imperialists had to sign a Dutch-Indonesian truce agreement in October 1946, mediated by Lord Killearn, representative of British imperialism, which was agreed upon in November. However, the Linggadjati Agreement was not formally signed until March 1947. The Dutch imperialists recognized Indonesia's independence and stipulated that the areas occupied by British and Dutch forces in Indonesia should be incorporated into the territory of the Republic of Indonesia by January 1, 1949, at the latest. But in July 1947, Dutch imperialism shamelessly tore up all agreements and launched a new war of aggression under the pretext of revising the "Linggadjati Agreement."
	Indonesia is a fairly wealthy place. Tin production accounts for 20% of the world's total, and oil production accounts for 10% of the world's total. According to statistics in 1940, oil production reached 6.5 million barrels. Other products such as rubber, tobacco, spices, and diamonds are also extremely abundant. Therefore, when British imperialism was unable to assist Dutch imperialism, the greedy eyes of American imperialism turned to this place. In order to find markets and sources of raw materials for the big capitalists of Wall Street, American imperialism used dollar arms to aid the Netherlands, replacing British imperialism in aiding the Dutch intervention in Indonesia's independence, enabling Dutch imperialism to dare to destroy the "Linggadjati Agreement" and re-attack Indonesia. At the same time, after the conspiracy of the United States and Britain to "mediate" Indonesia alone failed, American imperialism turned to buying over the reactionary elements of the upper strata of the Indonesian bourgeoisie, such as Sjahrir and Hatta, to usurp the political power of the Republic of Indonesia. In January of this year, under the pressure of the US, Australian, and Belgian "mediation" committee manipulated by American imperialism, Sjahrir and his ilk signed the humiliating "Renville" traitorous agreement: accepting a ceasefire in place, allowing the Republic of Indonesia to be incorporated into the "United States of Indonesia," and recognizing the rule of the Dutch Empire. The independence won by the heroic struggle of the Indonesian Communist Party and the people was offered to Dutch imperialism, turning independent Indonesia back into a "dominion" of the Dutch Empire. The puppet government headed by Hatta, the running dog of the US and the Netherlands, also appeared at this time. In March, the so-called "Dutch-Indonesian Federal Government" was established. American imperialism aided the Dutch aggressors with 600 million US dollars and allowed the Hatta puppet government to use weapons to attack the Indonesian people. At this time, the Indonesian people and various Indonesian democratic parties further strengthened internal unity and reorganized their forces. The Socialist Party, the Labor Party, the Indonesian Socialist Labor League, and the All-Indonesian Socialist Youth Party of the Indonesian Democratic People's Front were all merged into the Indonesian Communist Party, and a new leading body was established to lead the 70 million Indonesian people in a just war of independence against US and Dutch imperialism and their running dog Hatta. On September 1, the Indonesian Youth Association in Yogyakarta held a demonstration against the Hatta reactionary cabinet's compromise with the Dutch imperialists. On September 18, under the leadership of the Indonesian Communist Party, the Indonesian people in Madiun, the third largest city in Indonesia, launched a self-defense armed uprising of patriotic people against the traitorous and capitulationist Hatta government, so that the Hatta government army in Madiun also participated in this great uprising, and Madiun became the property of the Indonesian people.
	Since then, the Hatta puppet government has more frantically and brutally closed down the Indonesian Communist Party and left-wing newspapers, finally squeezed out the more progressive members of Congress, massacred the Indonesian communists and patriotic people captured in Madiun, and arrested as many as 45,000 Indonesian people. On November 24, the "Indonesian Republic Delegation" formed by Sjahrir of Indonesia and the special mission of the Dutch cabinet headed by Dutch Foreign Minister Stikker resumed negotiations near Yogyakarta. Although no agreement was reached, it exposed the aggressive ambitions of American imperialism, which attempted to plunder Indonesia's large quantities of oil, rubber, sugar, coconuts, and other raw materials. But the Indonesian people opposed this humiliating negotiation. On December 7, the Indonesian trade union leadership decided that the Indonesian trade unions would reject any agreement that might harm the sovereignty of the Republic of Indonesia. At the same time, in the week from December 1 to 7, 307 incidents of resistance occurred in the Dutch-occupied areas, which showed the strength of the Indonesian people's will to fight. On the 19th of this month, the Dutch army, equipped by American imperialism, launched a new aggressive offensive against Indonesia. The Indonesian people continued to take up arms and resist heroically, while the traitors Hatta and his ilk became the shameful prisoners of the Dutch imperialist aggressors.

　　英勇斗争的印尼人民
    三百五十一年前，印度尼西亚人民开始遭受荷兰帝国主义的侵略和奴役，在这样长久的年月中，印尼人民曾不断进行了英勇反抗的斗争。自一九二一年印尼共产党成立后，印尼人民从此才有了坚强的领导，在对荷兰帝国主义的斗争中也有了新的发展。太平洋战争爆发后，日本占领时期，印尼共产党组织了人民抗日军，进行对日斗争。日本投降后，印尼宣布独立，成立印尼共和国，对过去三百五十年的奴役生活作了一个结束。然而日本投降后不久，一九四五年的十月，英荷帝国主义的军队即相继侵入印尼，并留用日军镇压印尼人民，以继续奴役印尼人民，于是印尼共产党领导人民又被迫起来进行新的自卫解放战争。由于荷兰帝国主义的经济无法支持其侵略战争，更由于印尼共产党与人民力量的增涨，荷帝不得不在一九四六年十月，由英帝国主义代表基伦勋爵出面调停，签订荷印停战协定，十一月获得协议。然而直到一九四七年三月才正式签订了林加牙蒂协定。荷帝承认了印尼的独立，并规定英军和荷军在印尼占领的区域，至迟到一九四九年一月一日以前并入印尼共和国领土内。但到一九四七年七月荷兰帝国主义无耻地撕毁了一切协定，竟以修改“林加牙蒂协定”为借口，发动了新的侵略战争。
    印尼是一块相当富庶的地方，锡的产量占世界总产量的百分之二十，石油产量占世界总产量的百分之十，据一九四○年统计，石油产量达六百五十万桶。其他如橡胶、烟叶、香料、金钢钻等出产也极为丰富。因此，当英帝国主义无力援助荷帝国主义的时候，美帝国主义贪婪的两眼便注视到了这里，为了华尔街大资本家寻找市场及原料供给的来源，美帝国主义以美元军火援助荷兰，代替了英帝国主义援荷干涉印尼的独立，使荷帝国主义敢于破坏“林加牙蒂协定”，重新进攻印尼；同时，在美英企图单独“调停”印尼的阴谋破产后，美帝国主义就转而收买印尼资产阶级上层反动分子，如沙利尔、哈达之流，使之篡夺了印尼共和国的政权。今年一月，在美帝操纵下的美、澳、比三国“调停”委员会的压力下，沙利尔之流更签订了屈辱的“伦维尔”卖国协定：接受就地停战，允许印尼共和国并入“印尼合众国”，承认荷帝国的统治。把由印尼共产党与人民英勇斗争争得的独立，奉送给荷帝国主义，使独立的印尼重新变为荷帝的“自治领”。以美荷走狗哈奴为首的傀儡政府亦于这时出现。三月更成立了所谓“荷印联邦政府”，美帝以六亿美元援助荷帝侵略者，并允许给哈达傀儡政府武器进攻印尼人民。这时，印尼人民与印尼各民主党派，便进一步加强内部团结，从新组办力量，印尼民主人民阵线的社会党、劳工党、印尼社会主义劳工联盟及全印尼社会主义青年党都并入印尼共产党，并建立了新的领导机构，领导七千万印尼人民与美荷帝国主义及其走狗哈达之流作正义的独立战争。九月一日日惹印尼青年会举行示威，反对哈达反动内阁与荷帝妥协，九月十八日在印尼共产党领导下的印尼人民在印尼第三大城茉莉芬爆发了爱国人民反对卖国投降的哈达政府的自卫武装起义，使茉城的哈达政府军队也参加了这伟大的起义，茉城也就为印尼人民所有。
    此后，哈达傀儡政府更加疯狂残暴的封闭了印尼共产党及左翼的报纸，最后排挤了国会中较进步的议员，屠杀了在茉莉芬捕去的印尼共产党人及爱国志士，更大肆逮捕印尼人民数达四万五千多人。十一月廿四日，印尼沙利尔组成的“印尼共和国代表团”与荷帝外长斯蒂克为首组织的荷兰内阁特别使团在日惹附近恢复了谈判，虽未获协议，但却暴露了美帝国主义的侵略野心，它企图大肆掠夺印尼的大宗石油、橡胶、白糖、椰子及其他所需原料。但印尼人民是反对这种辱国谈判的，在十二月七日印尼工会领导机关决议：印尼工会拒绝一切可能损害印尼共和国主权的协定。同时，在十二月一日到七日一周间，荷占领区内发生了反抗事件三百零七起，这表示了印尼人民斗争意志的坚强。本月十九日由美帝国装备的荷军又对印尼发动新的侵略进攻，印尼人民继续拿起武器英勇抵抗，而卖国贼哈达之流却作了荷帝国侵略者可耻的阶下囚。
