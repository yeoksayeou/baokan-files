Xinhua News Agency, North China, 26th: Baoding citizens held a grand celebration rally on the 12th of this month to celebrate the city's liberation. Early in the morning, congratulatory slogans were posted all over the streets. Various factories and citizens formed Yangko teams and performed in the streets in shifts. Propaganda trucks drove through the streets and alleys, filled with songs. The entire city was filled with the sounds of gongs and drums all day long, as if celebrating a festival. In the evening, the urban area was brightly lit. Workers, staff, citizens, and garrison troops formed a huge procession and flooded into the public stadium. At 6 p.m., the meeting officially began. When General Sun Yi, Commander of the Central Hebei Military Region and Director of the City's Military Control Commission, reported on the victories on various battlefields, cheers shook the entire venue. Mayor Zhu Zemin called on all citizens to build a new Baoding, develop industry and commerce, work hard in production, expand cultural and educational work, and actively support the People's Liberation War. Chu Zhenjiang, an old worker at the Baoding Station of the Pinghan Railway, after denouncing the crimes of the Liu bandits' Huainan destruction of the station's water tower, said: "In the past, we workers lived in hunger and hardship. Now that we are liberated, we must build a democratic new China and contribute our skills to the country."

[Central Hebei Electric] The general price level in Baoding City is gradually stabilizing, and the prices of some daily necessities are gradually decreasing. Before the city's liberation, due to the Chiang bandits' inflation and exorbitant taxes and levies, prices had been soaring. Therefore, when it was first liberated, the general price level was higher than that in the liberated areas. Later, the Central Hebei Trading Company transported a large number of daily necessities to regulate the market, and the People's Bank of China also systematically released enemy currency. As a result, the prices of some daily necessities began to fall. Taking the city prices for the three days from the 6th to the 8th of this month as an example: millet flour was 500 Central Hebei currency per catty, corn flour was 400 yuan, alkali noodles were 3,200 yuan, and pork was 1,600 yuan (3,200 yuan when it was first liberated), all showing stability. White oil fell from 2,900 yuan to 1,600 yuan, soybean oil from 2,900 yuan to 1,800 yuan, and sesame oil from 3,000 yuan to 2,400 yuan. Now industrial and commercial households have resumed business one after another.

　　保定市民集会
  　欢腾庆祝该市解放
    【新华社华北二十六日电】保定市民于本月十二日举行庆祝该市解放大会，盛况空前。清早，各街遍贴庆贺标语，各工厂及市民组成秧歌队，在街头轮流演出。宣传卡车驶过大街小巷，到处洋溢着歌声。全市竟日锣鼓喧天，如临佳节。入晚市区灯光辉煌。参加庆祝大会的工人、职员、市民和卫戍部队组成巨大行列，涌向公共体育场，六时，正式开会。当冀中军区司令员兼该市军管会主任孙毅将军报告各战场胜利情况时，欢声震动全场。市长朱泽民号召全体市民：建设新保定，发展工商业，努力从事生产，展开文化教育工作，积极支援人民解放战争。平汉铁路保定站老工人褚振江在控诉刘匪化南毁坏车站水塔等罪行后说：“过去我们工人在饥饿和困苦中生活，现在我们解放了，我们要建设民主的新中国，把技术贡献给国家。”
    【冀中电】保定市一般物价渐趋平稳，部分日用品逐渐下降。该市解放前，由于蒋匪通货膨胀，苛杂勒索，物价一直飞涨。因之刚解放时，一般物价均较解放区为高，后经冀中贸易公司运入大批日用品调剂市场，中国人民银行也有步骤地排出敌币，部分日用品遂开始回落。以本月六日至八日三天市价为例：小米面每市斤冀钞五百元，玉米面四百元，碱面三千二百元，猪肉一千六百元（刚解放时三千二百元，（都显平稳。白油由二千九百元降到一千六百元，豆油由二千九百元降到一千八百元，香油由三千元降到二千四百元。现工商户已相继复业。
