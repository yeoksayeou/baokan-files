The People's Liberation Army has stipulated four temporary measures for the protection of schools, scenic spots and historical sites: (1) No troops are allowed to be stationed in schools, scenic spots or historical sites; (2) Cadres should be sent to contact all schools, scenic spots and historical sites under the control of the People's Liberation Army, and the troops should issue proclamations and send guards to protect them; (3) All scenic spots and historical sites are prohibited from being visited during the war to avoid damage; (4) When troops are transferred, the troops ordered to protect the schools, scenic spots and historical sites should issue certificates and complete transfer procedures to clarify responsibilities. The department has also organized three discipline inspection teams to carry out inspections.

Xinhua News Agency, East China, 28th: The well-known仁慈(Renci, Benevolence) Hospital in Huaiyin, Northern Jiangsu, was burned down by the Kuomintang bandit troops before their escape. The hospital was founded by Lin Jiamei of the American Presbyterian Church and has a history of fifty years. It is very large, with the hospital buildings occupying an area of about 50 acres, and is equipped with X-ray and other equipment. On the 31st of last month, before the Kuomintang First Pacification Headquarters fled, all the valuable medicines in the hospital were looted, and the bandit troops under its command were ordered to surround the hospital on all four sides at 1:00 AM, pour kerosene on it, and set it on fire. The bandit troops also threatened the hospital staff with guns, forbidding them to put out the fire. The fire burned until 2:00 PM on the 2nd of this month before it was extinguished.
