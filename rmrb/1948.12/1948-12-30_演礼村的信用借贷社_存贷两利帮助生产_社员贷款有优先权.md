[Taiyue Telegram] The credit and loan cooperative of Yanli United Village (eight administrative villages) in Yangcheng earnestly implements the principle of mutual benefit for savings and loans. It serves shareholders and borrowers, facilitating and assisting industrial, agricultural, and sideline production. The cooperative was established in January 1947. At that time, the masses used materials such as cloth, grain, cotton, and copper as shares, totaling 10,700 yuan (new currency). There were a total of 1,120 male and female members. At the time, the credit cooperative used 5,000 yuan to operate a coal kiln, and the rest was used to assist industrial, commercial, agricultural, and sideline production in various villages. Now, the cooperative's own shares have increased to over 98,000 yuan, with deposits of 24,750 yuan; the number of members has increased to 1,517. It has provided loans of more than 300,000 yuan for commerce, cooperatives, transportation, agriculture, and industry; lent over 100,000 yuan worth of materials such as iron, grain, cotton, bowls, cloth, and salt; and made loan orders worth more than 646,600 yuan. This has played a significant role in developing production enterprises. For example, this year it helped Yanli and Lianli villages establish five small blast furnaces, and the seven bowl kilns in Lizhuanggou were also developed with the help of the credit cooperative. The cooperatives of six villages borrowed 100,000 yuan and bought more than a dozen head of livestock. Therefore, the bowl kilns, blast furnaces, and twenty-odd small cooperatives of the six village cooperatives all support the credit cooperative. Depositors say, "We feel secure putting our money in the cooperative." The credit cooperative has been able to develop and expand so quickly mainly because it has grasped the principle of "mutual benefit for savings and loans, developing production"; especially after the cooperative managers' meeting in July this year, it further clarified the policy of "serving shareholders and borrowers with mutual benefit for savings and loans," stipulated that members have priority for loans, and adopted the method of loan ordering and lending materials to be repaid with materials, which further developed various types of production. This autumn, when the bowl kilns and iron furnaces produced goods that could not be sold for a while, the credit cooperative used funds to order 15,000 jin of iron and 2,000 bundles of bowls. This helped the iron furnaces and bowl kilns to continue production, without fear of not being able to sell their goods. In addition, it also supported small traders and transportation. The masses are very satisfied with this method. Because this method is beneficial to both members and borrowers, the credit cooperative lent out a total of 4,090 jin of cotton last winter and this spring. After spinning, they repaid with cloth or sold it to repay with money. The credit cooperative recovered 744 bolts of cloth, and the masses earned 1,201 bolts. This autumn, it lent out another 3,000 jin of cotton and recovered 600 bolts of cloth. The masses earned another 900 bolts of cloth. The credit cooperative earned 50,000 yuan from this item alone, and the masses earned a total of 2,101 bolts of cloth.

　　演礼村的信用借贷社
  　存贷两利帮助生产
  　社员贷款有优先权
    【太岳电】阳城演礼联村（八个行政村）的信用贷款合作社，认真实行存贷两利。为股东、贷户服务，便利与帮助了工、农、副业生产。该社是一九四七年一月搞起来的，当时群众用实物布、粮食、棉花、铜等作价入股，共集股金一万零七百元（新币，下同）；共有男女社员一千一百二十人。当时信贷合作社用五千元经营了一座煤窑，其余就用来帮助各村工商业和农、副业生产，发展到现在，信贷合作社本身股金已增加到九万八千余元，存款二万四千七百五十元；社员发展到一千五百一十七人。并在商业、合作社、运输、农业、工业等方面贷出款三十多万元；贷出铁、粮食、棉花、碗、布、盐等实物值十万多元；贷款定货六十四万六千多元。对发展生产事业上起了很大作用。如今年就帮助演礼、联礼两村建立了五座方炉，李庄沟七个碗窑也都是信用合作社帮助发展的。六个村合作社贷款十万、买了十几头牲口。所以六个村的合作社的碗窑、方炉及二十几个小型合作社等，对信贷合作社都很拥护。存款户说：“把款放在合作社就放心”。信贷合作社能够发展扩大的这样快，主要是掌握了“存贷两利、发展生产”的原则；特别是今年七月合作社经理会议以后，更明确了“存、贷两利为股东贷户服务”的方针，规定社员贷款有优先权，采用了贷款定货、贷实还实的办法，更加发展了各种生产。今年秋天碗窑和铁炉作出货，一时卖不出去，信贷社就拿款定了一万五千斤铁，定了两千捆碗。这样帮助了铁炉、碗窑能够继续生产，不怕货推销不了。另外也扶植了小商贩运输。这种办法，群众很满意。因为这个办法对社员和贷款户都有利，所以信贷合作社去年冬天和今年春天一共贷出棉花四千零九十斤，纺织以后，还布或卖了还花。信贷合作社收回了七百四十四匹布，群众赚了一千二百零一匹。今年秋后又贷出三千斤棉花，收回了六百匹布。群众又赚了九百匹布。信贷社光这一项上就赚了五万来元，群众一共赚了两千一百零一匹布。
