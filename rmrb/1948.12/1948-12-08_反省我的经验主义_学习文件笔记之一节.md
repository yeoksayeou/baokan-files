　　Reflecting on My Empiricism
　　——A Section of Study File Notes
　　Guo Tingjun
　　Before the rectification campaign, I did not fully understand the importance of the Party's discipline and organization, although I had read central documents such as the "Decision on Strengthening Party Spirit" and "Against Liberalism."
　　The rectification study enabled me to make great progress. The main gain was breaking away from my own dogmatism and the method and style of being boastful and impractical, which was certainly progress compared to the past. However, with this came the development of (which also existed in the past, but was not the main thing) serious narrow empiricism, forming an anti-theory tendency. Verbally, I did not admit that theory was useless, but in practice, when dealing with problems, the only basis had to be personal experience or realistic materials. The so-called "from the masses, to the masses," I thought that only the experiences created by the masses (including lower-level cadres) themselves at that time and place were the only basis for guiding the masses. If I had to look for a basis in books to explain the current problem, it would be considered dogmatism, limiting the starting point of guiding work only to my own experience, without combining it with theory. After the rectification, I rarely read books, because I felt that they were useless; it was better to go to the village for a few days of investigation to solve problems than to read a book. Under the guidance of this kind of thinking method, when leading subordinates, I dared not boldly arrange work when there was no experience in a task; I dared not issue instructions until successful experiences were discovered below, fearing subjectivism. Caution is right, and the experience of subordinates is of course valuable, but it should not be absolutized and one-sided, without accepting the experience of others and correct theoretical knowledge that is in line with reality. Because I didn't understand this, I narrowed my own leadership intelligence, often feeling that I lacked experience; thus, I also reduced the courage to lead and lost the necessary and possible guidance.
　　My attitude towards superiors was: I always felt that the higher up you went, the further away you were from reality, and the more general the instructions were, and they might not be suitable for our situation. Therefore, when accepting instructions, I emphasized flexibility and specificity, otherwise it would be dogmatic and mechanical application. Therefore, the instructions of superiors often became reference in nature. Because I was limited by narrow experience, it was inevitable to distort the instructions of superiors. For example, when I was working in Qi County last year, the district party committee repeatedly instructed to stop killing people and resettle landlords and rich peasants, but I thought that generally killing could be stopped, but the border areas were special circumstances and should be an exception; killing could not be stopped. As for resettling landlords and rich peasants, I thought that the district party committee's instruction was for the entire Taihang area, and Qi County had not fully mobilized the masses, so landlords and rich peasants should not be resettled too early, and as a result, it was not implemented. In fact, the masses in Qi County had undergone a certain degree of mobilization, and the landlords and rich peasants who had been swept out of their homes should have been resettled. Often, some things were decided without asking superiors for instructions because I thought they were not principle issues. For example, when the martial arts team was established in Qi County last year, it was thought that it was needed for the struggle against the enemy, and expenses were paid from local grain without needing approval from superiors. In fact, at that time, after requesting superiors to expand the armed forces in Qi County was not allowed (because it could not be afforded), I did it myself under the support of the "independent kingdom" mentality: "If you don't approve it, I will pay for it from local grain, and the problem will be solved by increasing public grain." This was obviously an extremely irresponsible attitude towards the Party and the people. Some things I asked superiors for instructions on, and if they agreed with my opinion, I would be very happy; otherwise, I would think that the superiors were subjective, did not understand the situation below, and did not understand the difficulties below. The same was true of my views on comrades. I felt that comrades with theory were just full of dogmas and were nothing great, and I despised them. Comrades from below felt that everything was good. The same was true of my views on leaders. Therefore, I respected one leader, but was not convinced by another leader in my heart, and sometimes even openly confronted them. From this, I also developed a reluctance to work in the organs, thinking that the workers in the organs were "empty talkers." Last year and this year, when I was transferred to the organs, I showed great displeasure. This shows that in addition to being unhealthy in consciousness (I knew this in the past), there are great errors in my thinking methods and understanding.
　　In short, from all aspects of the review, in fact, it became not the subordinate obeying the superior, but the superior having to obey the subordinate, obeying myself, changing the Party's organizational principle of democratic centralism. The basis for supporting this thinking and action was that I thought that I was close to reality below and had a practical basis. If the superiors did not listen to me, it was not proceeding from reality, and it was subjectivism. I completely did not understand that superiors have more extensive situations and experiences, as well as more advanced theoretical knowledge. This narrow empiricist way of thinking (taking everything from my own work area as the only basis), coupled with the petty bourgeoisie's own inherent weaknesses of freedom and laxity, resulted in serious localism and a state of anarchy and lack of discipline.
　　During the reorganization, I received Party disciplinary action because of the killing issue. At that time, I knew I was wrong and had no complaints against the Party. But I was very distressed: why did I make this mistake? The rectification campaign was also very strict on organizational issues, and I thought I had gained a lot, so why was there even less organization and discipline after the rectification? At that time, I only considered that in the past, it was simply about getting the ideology straight, without disciplinary sanctions. In addition, I also found some root causes in my consciousness, but this was obviously not thorough. Therefore, after the reorganization, I was cautious in my work, dared not handle problems boldly, and was very passive. At that time, I thought this was an inevitable phenomenon for a while. I discussed it with other comrades and thought that the root was still the worship of individualism, which of course was also a reason, but I thought it was not only that, the main reason was that I had not figured it out in terms of thinking methods and had not completely found the real root of the error.
　　In early June, the prefectural committee convened a joint meeting of county party committees. During the nearly twenty-day meeting, my thinking was enlightened, and I began to feel that I had an anti-theoretical tendency and that the empiricist way of thinking had been dominant since the rectification campaign. From the entire atmosphere of the meeting, from everyone's reports and discussions, I also had the same feeling, which further clarified my problems. For example, a series of problems concerning the relationship between middle and poor peasants, I had encountered a lot in practice in the past, but they had never been solved correctly. If I had a certain amount of theoretical knowledge combined with practice, perhaps it would have been solved long ago. At this time, I began to feel that practice without theoretical guidance is blind practice, and I could not see it even if I looked at it every day.
　　Recently, after reading the passage in the "Preface to Chapter Two of 'Left-Wing' Communism: an Infantile Disorder" which states: "The indiscipline or anarchism which to a sufficient degree is still prevalent among us, the tendency to act independently, and the failure to observe discipline—is certainly not a thing of the past. Localism, a tendency to act on one's own, to work 'for oneself,' is certainly not a thing of the past.", I was prompted to further consider the relationship between localism and empiricism. It made me have to liquidate my consistent undisciplined or anarchistic thinking and long-term empiricist methods from a historical perspective, and it made me realize for the first time that the state of disorganization and lack of discipline since the rectification campaign was precisely due to the support of long-term empiricist thinking. Therefore, I believe that in order to overcome the state of lack of discipline and anarchy in the future, in addition to continuing to cultivate in ideology, improve class consciousness, and closely link with the masses (practice), the more important link must be to correct the wrong thinking method—empiricism, strengthen the study of theory, and improve ideological understanding. Otherwise, discipline will not become truly conscious, and therefore will not be consolidated. It is inconceivable that without correct thinking methods and a certain theoretical level, one can completely correctly and consciously accept the instructions of superiors and the Party's policies and implement them simply by relying on organizational means.

　　反省我的经验主义
    ——学习文件笔记之一节
    郭廷俊
    整风以前，对党的纪律性、组织性的重要是不十分了然的，虽然当时也曾读过中央关于增强党性的决定、反对自由主义等文件。
    整风学习，使自己有很大进步。主要收获在于打破了自己的教条主义，夸夸其谈不务实际的方法与作风，这比过去当然是个进步。但随着而来又发展了（过去也存在，不过不是主要的）严重的狭隘经验主义，形成反理论倾向。口头上我并不承认理论是没用的，但实际在处理问题时，唯一的根据必须是亲身的经验，或是现实的材料。所谓“从群众中来，到群众中去”，以为只有当时当地群众（包括下级干部）自己创造出来的经验，才是指导群众唯一的依据。如果要从书本上去找根据来说明当前问题，即认为是教条主义，把指导工作的出发点仅仅局限于自己的经验，而没有把它和理论结合起来。整风后我很少看书，其原因就在于感到它没有用处，与其看一本书，还不如亲身到村里做几天调查可以解决问题。在这样思想方法的指导下，对下面领导时，在一件工作没有经验时不敢大胆布置；下面没有发现成功的经验前，不敢再发指示，只怕主观主义。谨慎是对的，下面的经验当然也是宝贵的，可是不应该把它绝对化片面化，而不去接受别人的经验及切合实际的正确理论知识。因为不了解这点，所以缩小了自己领导的智力，常常感到经验少；因而也就减少了领导的勇气，失去必要与可能的指导。
    对上级的态度是：总认为越往上离实际就越远，指示也就越带一般性，不一定适合我们这里的情况。因此，接受指示时，强调灵活性、具体化，否则就是教条机械搬用。因此，上级指示常常就变为参考性质的了。因为被狭隘经验所局限，必不可免的要歪曲上级指示，如去年我在淇县工作时，区党委曾再三指示停止杀人和安置地富，但我认为一般可以停止，边地是特殊情况，应该例外，不能不杀。安置地富，我认为区党委是对整个太行情况指示的，淇县还没有充分发动群众，不应过早安置地富，结果也没有执行。事实上淇县群众是经过一定程度的发动的，扫地出门的地富是应该安置的。常常有些事情，自以为不是原则问题，不请示上级就擅自决定了。如去年淇县成立武工队，以为对敌斗争需要，从地方粮开支，不必再经上级批准。事实上当时是在曾经要求上级扩大淇县武装未经允许（因为负担不起）后，自己在“独立国”的思想支持下：“你不批准，我就从地方粮开支，多起点公粮就解决问题了”搞的，这显然是对党对人民极不负责的一种态度。有些事情请示上级，如果答应了自己意见，就感到很高兴，反之就认为上级主观主义，不了解下情，不体会下面困难。对同志们看法也是如此，有理论的同志，感到他不过是满肚教条，没啥了不起，轻视他。从下面来的同志，则感到一切都好。对领导者看法亦然。因此，有对某个领导者尊重，对另一个领导者却内心不服，有时甚至公开对抗。由此也就产生不愿到机关工作，认为机关工作者是“客里空”。去年及今年调我到机关来，都表现了十分的不愉快。这说明除在意识上不健康外（这点过去知道），思想方法及认识上有极大的错误。
    总之，从各方面检查起来，实际上变成了不是下级服从上级，而是上级必须服从下级，服从自己，改变了党的民主集中制的组织原则，支持这个思想行动的依据，就是认为自己在下边接近实际，有实际根据，上级不听我的话，就是不从实际出发，就是主观主义。完全不了解上级有更广泛的情况和经验，以及有比较高级的理论知识。这种狭隘经验主义的思想方法（一切从自己工作地区出发做为唯一根据），再加上小资产阶级本身就带着自由散漫的劣根性，结果就形成严重的地方主义，无政府无纪律状态。
    整编中，因为杀人问题，受到了党的纪律处分。当时我认识知道是错了，对党毫无埋怨。但十分苦闷：为什么会犯这种错误？整风中对组织问题整的也很严格，自以为收获还不少，为什么整风后更加没有组织性、纪律性呢？当时只考虑到过去是单纯打通思想，没有纪律制裁，另外在意识上也找到了些根源，但这显然不是彻底的。因此，整编后在工作中是谨小慎微，不敢大胆处理问题，消极性很大。当时以为这是一时难免的现象，和别的同志研究，认为根子仍是个人主义作崇，这当然也是一个原因，但我认为不仅如此，主要原因还在于没有从思想方法上弄通，没有完全找到错误的真正根子。
    六月初，地委召开县委联席会，在将近二十天的会议中，启发了我的思想，开始感到自己有反理论倾向，经验主义的思想方法整风以来是占统治地位的。从整个会议的空气中，从大家的汇报讨论中，我也有同样的感觉，使我的思想进一步明确了自己的问题。比如关于中贫农关系的一连串问题，过去在实际中碰到的实在不少了，总没有得到正确解决。假如有一定的理论知识与实际结合起来，也许早就解决了。这时，开始感到没有理论指导的实际是盲目的实际，天天看看不见。
    最近读了“重印左派幼稚病第二章前言”文件中的“党内过去存在或现在还没有克服的无纪律状态，或无政府状态，各自为政和各行其是的地方主义与经验主义，已经给人民的革命事业造成了许多严重损失”这段话以后，引起我进一步去考虑地方主义与经验主义的关系。使我不得不从历史上来清算自己一贯的无纪律或无政府思想，及长时期的经验主义方法，并使我第一次认识到整风以来的无组织无纪律状态，正是由于长时期经验主义的思想支持。因此我认为今后克服无纪律无政府状态，除了继续在思想意识上修养，提高阶级觉悟和紧密的连系群众（实际）外，更重要的一环，必须是纠正错误的思想方法——经验主义，加强学习理论，提高思想认识。否则纪律就不会成为真正自觉的，因而也就不会巩固。不能设想，没有正确的思想方法和一定的理论水准，单纯依靠组织手段而能完全正确的和自觉的接受上级指示和党的政策，并能贯彻下去。
