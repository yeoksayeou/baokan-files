　　【Taihang News】Women in Xing City have achieved great success in organized production. According to statistics from the First District alone, they have earned over 218,000 jin of rice in the past six months, resolving the livelihood issues for a significant portion of the population. Their primary production this year has been making socks for the clothing factory. The First District produced over 54,000 pairs in half a year. Because making socks is profitable, many people are participating. In Xuetao Street, out of 150 women capable of needlework, all but ten, who were sick or had other commitments, participated. Most of these women combined making socks with household chores and managing stalls. Some women earn enough from making socks to support their entire families. Shen Guo's wife made a total of 260 pairs, earning over 1,000 jin of millet. After providing enough food for her family of three for half a year, she still had over 200 jin left. In order to expand women's production this winter and spring, and to solve the livelihood difficulties of some unemployed workers and impoverished citizens in the city, the Qianjin Shoe Factory has negotiated with the North China Government to undertake the production of 300,000 pairs of military shoes, scheduled to be completed by the end of October next year. In addition to the male workers completing part of the work, the processes of sole sewing, upper sewing, and insole making alone will require the participation of over 4,200 women daily. The shoe factory has now established the standards for making shoes and the wage rates: for sewing the sole with over 800 stitches per pair, the wage is 3.2 jin of millet per pair; for sewing the upper with seven stitches per inch, the wage is 0.5 jin of rice per pair; for making an insole, the wage is 0.4 jin of millet per pair. Women throughout the city are currently organizing and launching this campaign. (Qianjin Daily)

　　邢市一区妇女勤劳生产
  　半年赚米廿余万斤
    【太行讯】邢市在组织妇女生产上，取得很大成绩，半年来仅据一区统计，即赚米二十一万八千余斤，解决了一大部分人的生活问题。她们今年的主要生产是给被服厂做袜子，一区半年共做五万四千余双。因为做袜子有利，参加的人很多，学道街能做针线活的妇女共有一百五十人，除十人因病或有其它事外都参加了。这些人大部是一面做袜子，一面做家中的零碎活和看摊子相结合。有的妇女做袜赚钱能养活全家。申郭氏一共做了二百六十双，赚了一千多斤小米，除全家三口人够半年吃外，还余了二百余斤。该市为了开展今冬明春的妇女生产，解决本市某些失业工人及贫苦市民生活困难，又经前进鞋工厂和华北政府商妥，承做军鞋三十万双，定于明年十月底完成。此项生产除男工完成一部外，仅纳底、纳帮、垫底，每日即需组织四千二百余妇女参加。现鞋厂已订出做鞋标准及工钱数目为：纳底一双八百针以上，每双工资小米三斤二两；纳帮每英寸七针，每双工资米五两；垫底一双，小米四两。现全市妇女正在组织开展这一运动。（前进报）
