    With Us, Invincible
    —Remembering the Heroic Unit of the Naoma Pao Diao Battle
    Yuan Mingruan, Zhang Chunxun, Ouyang
    "Do you know we are the unit that defended Dongcun?" Soldiers Li Shuanhai, Song Erbao, and Lan Guifang first told the enemy about the glorious history of their unit during the intense exchange of grenades.

    The soldiers stood at their respective battle positions. Before the enemy came within the range of their grenades, they systematically fired cold shots. Every time they shot down an enemy, cheers and applause erupted on the position. "Company commander, company commander! Another one down!"

    In the Jinzhong Campaign, facing an enemy six times our strength, under the cover of intense artillery fire and armored vehicles, these heroes who defended Dongcun and successfully blocked the fleeing remnants of Yan's 33rd and 34th armies, now appeared on the Naoma Pao Diao position. They were so steadfast and calm, so confident in the face of the enemy's desperate counterattacks.

    On the night of November 10th, after our heroic units occupied the eastern position of Naoma Pao Diao, the enemy, relying on the remaining western position, began a desperate struggle from dawn the next day, concentrating all the artillery fire and more than two thousand troops they could muster, launching a full-day counterattack.

    This was a position of more than forty mu, with trenches connecting the enemy and us. Fierce battles unfolded in the trenches to seize every section of the trench and every support point.

    The Jiang-Yan bandit gang, using the pistols and bayonets of their execution squads, coerced their officers and soldiers, driving them like sheep toward our positions. At first, they drove them in companies, then in battalions. After our soldiers killed, wounded, or repelled the enemies in front of them, they had to prepare to kill the enemies who were about to arrive immediately. Every time the enemy counterattacked, the soldiers inflicted heavy casualties on them.

    At one o'clock in the afternoon, the enemy not only broke through the forward positions but also penetrated deep into our lines. Enemies had appeared on one-third of our position.

    The pao diao (artillery bunker), this was the most important support point for the entire position. Now, the enemy was advancing along the trenches toward the pao diao, only forty or fifty meters away.

    It was in this most tense and critical situation that moving scenes and heroic deeds emerged everywhere. "We must fight resolutely! If we don't have grenades, use rifles; if we don't have bullets, use bayonets; if we don't have bayonets, use fists!" This firm order from Staff Officer Jiang Gang was verbally conveyed to every combat unit by the guards and scouts. Now, all kinds of weapons were used to their maximum effectiveness. Everyone's courage, wisdom, and energy were also used to the greatest extent. Zhang Minggu, a fifteen-year-old medical orderly, saw a grenade hit the instructor, just landed on the ground, and had not exploded. He immediately picked it up and threw it out with all his might. Wang Keming observed the enemy's trajectory, moving right and left. After the grenade exploded near him, he immediately retaliated fiercely towards the enemy's position. Chen Dingding, a heavy machine gun shooter, organized his squad members, one group throwing grenades, and the other group continuing to shoot, taking down two of the enemy's frantically firing machine guns. Bi Fuxiang, Zhang Genze, and Wang Yongchang, three small cannon shooters, simultaneously used two small cannons and a newly captured flying thunder cannon, firing at an accelerated rate. The mortar gunners under the command of Company Commander Zhao placed the mortar barrel on the trench, selected a target, fired a few shots, and immediately moved to another location, conducting guerrilla-style shoulder-arm firing. Towards the enemy's deep lines, towards the enemy's reinforcement roads, field guns, mountain guns, and heavy guns formed a blazing firepower zone. This was a sea of fire, it had already trapped the enemy in the position, no, it was already inflicting heavy casualties on the sea of people trapped in the position in layers of encirclement.

    As the enemy continued to develop deep into our lines, Tian Maohai, Bai Shoude, Zhang Quanfu, Wei Baoxiao, Guo Bingzheng, and Zhang Ming, these outstanding heroes, had been guarding their openings, and they kept holding onto the enemy's flanks and rear. The front of the trenches had been leveled, and the enemy's shells and grenades continued to fly over. Some of their ears had been deafened, and Comrade Tian Maohai had been injured, with half of his face covered in blood, but they never retreated. Because they knew that the more the enemy developed deep into their lines, the more important their position became. "The position that we shed blood to capture cannot be lost in vain," this was everyone's thought, everyone's belief, everyone's determination. Having run out of grenades, they resolutely and consciously carried out the chief of staff's orders, wearing steel helmets, and picking up rifles with fixed bayonets, squatting in the trenches in majestic poses, staring straight at the path where the enemy might arrive. Instructor Wang Jincai led a platoon, ordered to block the enemy advancing towards the pao diao from the front. In nearly an hour of fierce seesaw fighting, he organized continuous attacks, taking it down and then going up again. After several attacks back, Deputy Platoon Leader Sun Shiming took another squad up. Throwing grenades while charging forward. Just as they were about to approach the enemy, they ran out of grenades. Sun Shiming immediately took a mattock used for construction from a soldier behind him, and ran forward in one stride, slashing hard at the enemy's head twice. These two blows not only broke the enemy's head, but also broke the enemy's courage.

    The enemy was stopped in every trench. The enemy did not dare to advance any further, because there was not only a dense firepower net in front, but also bayonets and mattocks.

    On the transportation line blockaded by the enemy's artillery fire, a transportation team composed of agency personnel as the backbone continuously transported ammunition. Whenever ammunition was delivered to the soldiers, it was warmly welcomed everywhere: "Great! Great! With grenades, we will have even more ways to fight!" Ordnance man Li Qingxian carried ammunition, and sent it to wherever the fighting was tightest. Li Ercheng led the stretcher platoon, running for a whole day, covered in sweat. When they passed in front of the deputy political commissar, the deputy political commissar praised them: "Good!" When they passed in front of the chief of staff, the chief of staff praised them: "Good!" When they ran to the soldiers, the soldiers also praised them: "Good!" They, like the soldiers, had not eaten for two days. They explained to the stretcher bearers: "Comrades! Before the battle, we made a plan to overcome difficulties. Not being able to eat for two days is one of the items on the list." Yes, fighting means overcoming difficulties. Whoever can overcome difficulties will achieve final victory. One of the greatest characteristics of heroes is that they are good at advancing towards victory by overcoming difficulties. Relying on firmness, calmness, and wisdom, relying on all kinds of intensive firepower and bayonets and mattocks, relying on the selfless courage, mutual assistance, and mutual encouragement of all combat personnel and non-combat personnel, now, these heroes who are undergoing arduous defensive battles on the position are not only stopping the enemy's advance, but also about to launch a powerful assault on the enemy.

    When brotherly reinforcement troops arrived in time and immediately joined the battle, there was another triumphant cheer on the position, and the enemy began to collapse. At this time, Shen Hongxi and his gang of buglers picked up their bugles and blew them with extra vigor. The chief of staff picked up the telephone: "Towards the enemy's retreat route, every gun fires five rounds in unison!" Light and heavy machine guns intensified their roars, and amidst the killing sounds that shook the position, the heroes attacked the enemy from all directions. At this time, Tian Maohai, a special-class meritorious hero who held the enemy's flanks and rear, used his only weapon—the bayonet—to stab to death two enemies who refused to lay down their arms.

    This meritorious unit, which successfully completed the blocking task in the Dongcun battle of Jinzhong, in this battle to capture the important stronghold of Naoma on the outskirts of Taiyuan, in addition to crushing more than ten large and small counterattacks by the enemy within two days on the main position, finally created a brilliant example of the battle for the pao diao, killing and capturing a total of more than 1,500 enemy soldiers.

    This is a victorious and heroic unit. The unit's designation is the four big characters that the brigade party committee commended them with: "With Us, Invincible!"

    有我无敌
    ——记淖马炮碉争夺战的英雄部队
    袁明阮  张春旬  欧阳
    “你知道我们是坚守董村战斗的部队吗？”战士李拴孩、宋二保、兰桂芳在猛烈投弹的空隙当中，首先把自己部队的光荣历史告诉了敌人。
    战士们站在各个战斗岗位上，当敌人还没有进到手榴弹所能发挥威力的距离以内时，他们只是有组织的放着冷枪。每当打倒一个敌人，阵地上又是拍手又是叫好。“连长，连长！又打倒了一个！”
    在晋中战役当中，面对着在猛烈炮火与装甲车掩护之下六倍于我的敌人，这些坚守董村战斗，胜利地阻击了企图逃窜太原的阎匪三十三军三十四军等部的英雄们，现在又出现在淖马炮碉阵地上了。他们在敌人垂死挣扎的反扑面前，就是这样坚定沉着，这样具有信心地在进行着战斗。
    十一月十日深夜，当我英雄部队占领淖马炮碉东部阵地以后，敌人就依托残存的西部阵地，从第二天拂晓开始，集中他所能集中的炮火与两千多兵力，拚命进行垂死挣扎，整整反扑了一天。
    这是一块四十多亩大的阵地，交通壕把敌我双方互相贯通起来。为了争夺每一段交通壕与每一个支撑点，在交通壕里展开着非常激烈的搏斗。
    蒋阎匪帮用执法队的手枪刺刀胁迫他们的官兵，象赶羊似的，把士兵一群一群向我阵地赶来。开始是一个连一个连地赶，以后就一个营一个营地赶。我们的战士们把面前的敌人打死打伤或打退以后，马上就要准备杀伤立刻又要到来的敌人。敌人反扑一次，战士们就把敌人猛烈杀伤一次。
    下午一点钟，敌人不但突破了前沿，而且突入了纵深，在我军三分之一的阵地上，已经出现了敌人。
    炮碉，这是全部阵地最重要的支撑点。现在敌人正顺着交通壕，向着炮碉前进，离炮碉只有四、五十公尺了。
    就是在这种最紧张最危急的情况下，到处都是动人的场面，到处都是可歌可泣的事迹。“我们要坚决打！没有手榴弹用步枪，没有子弹用刺刀，没有刺刀用拳头！”参谋长江岗同志这一个坚决的命令，由警卫员与侦察员用口头传到了各个战斗单位。现在，各种武器都发挥了最高的威力。每个人的勇敢、智慧与精力，也都使用到了最高的程度。十五岁的小卫生员张明贵，看见一颗手榴弹打到指导员身上，刚刚落在地下还没爆炸的时候，马上拾起来，用力打出去了。王克明观察着敌人弹道的路线，右左移动，等到落在他身边的手榴弹刚刚爆炸以后，马上朝着敌人的位置，向着敌人猛烈回击。重机枪射手陈定丁，把本班战士组织起来，一个组打手榴弹，一个组继续射击，把敌人两挺疯狂的机枪打倒了。小炮射手毕福祥、张根则、王永昌三个人，同时使用着两门小炮与一门刚缴获的飞雷筒，加速地发射。在赵连长指挥下的迫击炮手们，把炮筒放在交通壕上，选择一定目标打几炮以后，马上又转移到另一个位置，进行游击式的肩臂射击。向着敌人纵深，向着敌人的增援道路，野炮、山炮、重炮构成了一层炽烈的火力地带。这是一片火海，它已经把陷入阵地的敌人，不，已经把陷入阵地的人海在层层包围中进行猛烈的杀伤。
    当着敌人向纵深继续发展的时候，田毛孩、白守德、张全福、卫保小、郭柄正、张明这些出色的英雄们，一直把守着他们的口子，一直坚持在敌人的侧后。交通壕的前沿已经摧平了，敌人的炮弹和手榴弹不断飞来，有的耳朵已经震聋，田毛孩同志已经负了伤，脸上流了半脸血，但他们始终没有退。因为他们知道敌人越是向纵深发展，他们所坚守的阵地就越重要。“我们流了血打下来的阵地，是不能白白丢掉的，”这是每个人的思想，每个人的信念，每个人的决心。打的没有手榴弹了，他们就坚决而自觉地执行着参谋长的命令，戴着钢盔，拿起上着刺刀的步枪，以雄伟的姿态蹲在交通壕内，眼睛直直地望着敌人可能到来的道路。指导员王进才带着一个排，奉命从正面阻击向炮碉前进的敌人。在将近一个钟头激烈的拉锯战斗中，他连续组织出击，打下来再上去。在几次出击回来以后，副排长孙士明又带着一个班上去了。一边打手榴弹，一边向前冲。快要与敌人接近的时候，没有手榴弹了。孙士明马上从后面一个战士手里，拿过一把做工事的洋镐，一个箭步跑上去，朝着敌人头上，狠狠地砍了两下。这两下，不但砍破了敌人的头，而且砍破了敌人的胆。
    敌人在各个交通壕内被阻止了。敌再也不敢前进，因为前面不但有密集的火力网，而且有刺刀，有洋镐。
    在敌人炮火封锁的运输线上，以机关人员为骨干所组成的运输队，不断地运送弹药。每当弹药送到战士们手里的时候，到处受到热烈的欢迎：“好！好！有了手榴弹就更加有了办法！”军械员李青先扛着弹药，看见那个地方打的紧，就往那个地方送。李二成带领的担架排，整整运了一天，跑的满头是汗。当他们从副政委跟前经过的时候，副政委夸奖他们：“好！”当他们从参谋长跟前经过的时候，参谋长夸奖他们：“好！”当他们跑到战士们跟前的时候，战士们也夸奖他们：“好！”他们与战士们一样，已经两天没有吃饭了。他们和担架员解释：“同志！在战斗以前，我们订计划要克服困难，两天吃不上饭，就是这里面的一条。”是的，战斗就是克服困难。谁能克服困难，谁就取得最后胜利。英雄们一个最大特点，就是善于在排除困难中向着胜利前进。依靠着坚定、沉着、智慧，依靠着各种密集火力与刺刀、洋镐，依靠全体战斗人员和非战斗人员的奋不顾身，互助团结，互相鼓舞，现在，这些在阵地上艰苦进行坚守战斗的英雄们，不但阻止了敌人的前进，而且要向敌人进行有力的突击了。
    当着兄弟增援部队及时到达，并立刻投入战斗以后，在阵地上又是一片胜利的欢呼，敌人在开始溃乱了。这时，申洪喜这伙小号兵们，拿起军号，吹得特别有劲。参谋长拿起电话机：“向着敌人撤退的路上，每门炮齐放五发！”轻重机枪加紧怒吼，在震撼阵地的杀声当中，英雄们从各个方向向着敌人出击。这时，坚守在敌人侧后的特等功臣田毛孩，使用着他唯一的武器——刺刀，刺死了两个拒绝放下武器的敌人。
    这支在晋中董村战斗胜利完成阻击任务的有功部队，在这次攻占太原外围重要据点淖马的战斗中，除在主阵地上面两天以内粉碎敌人大小十多次反扑以外，最后又在炮碉争夺战斗中，创造了争夺战的光辉范例，杀伤俘虏敌人共约一千五百余人。
    这是一支常胜的英雄部队，这个部队的番号，就是旅党委会嘉奖他们的四个大字：“有我无敌”！
