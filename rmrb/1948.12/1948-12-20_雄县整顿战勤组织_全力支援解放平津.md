[JiZhong Electric] In order to successfully complete the task of supporting the front and preparing for the decisive battle to liberate Peiping and Tientsin, the People's Armed Forces Department of Xiong County is actively rectifying wartime service organizations in the newly recovered areas. Over the past two years, the people of the county have actively supported the front in various battles north of the Daqing River, and have completed many glorious and arduous tasks. However, due to enemy harassment, the recovery time for the work was very short, and the county and districts did not pay enough attention to the rectification of wartime service work, so there are still many unreasonable phenomena in terms of manpower and animal power burden in various places. Recently, after the county rectified eleven key villages, it was found that the main problems existing in the villages are: (1) Wartime service organizations have not been established, and village cadres have great difficulties in their work and no appropriate solutions. Some village cadres have serious departmentalism. (2) There is no set method for attending duty. There are many duties and few people attending. Some village cadres and family members of soldiers with labor do not provide labor, naughty households do not provide labor, and honest farmers bear too much burden. This unreasonable phenomenon has aroused dissatisfaction among the masses, so the more difficult it is to allocate labor for duty. In light of these circumstances, the county is now actively rectifying. On the one hand, it is registering how many young, middle-aged, elderly, and family members of soldiers there are, and how many livestock there are; on the other hand, it is holding mass meetings to explain the methods of attending duty and the glory of performing wartime service tasks. Then, at the mass meeting, the registered items are announced to everyone and the age list is passed. Finally, according to how to combine with production, the four types of task forces are organized, and the substitute farming households for military families are determined (according to the substitute farming regulations). A total of eleven villages that have been organized now have: 782 long-term service laborers, 834 short-term service laborers, and 239 livestock, divided into first and second classes. The village militias have also been rectified at the same time, and have received two to four educations. Six villages in the first district have also conducted stretcher exercises and reviews. The masses in the villages are very satisfied with this wartime service rectification. For example, Zhang Gui from Huangwan Village said: "In the past, whoever was honest went. This time it's reasonable, and I won't say anything if I'm called to go again in the future." Some people also said: "Some farmers who were planning to sell livestock are no longer rushing to sell them."

　　雄县整顿战勤组织
  　全力支援解放平津
    【冀中电】雄县人民武装部为胜利完成支前任务，准备迎接解放平津大战，正积极整顿新收复区的战勤组织。两年来，该县人民在大清河北诸战役中，积极支援前线，曾完成了许多光荣艰巨的支前任务。但由于敌人的侵扰，工作的恢复时间很短，加以县区对整顿战勤工作重视不够，因而各地在人力畜力负担上还存在着很多不合理的现象。最近该县经过十一个重点村的整顿，发现目前各村存在的主要问题是：（一）没有建立起战勤组织，村干部在工作中存在很大困难没适当解决。有的村干存在严重的本位思想。（二）没有一定的出勤办法，勤务多，出勤的人少。有的村干部与有劳力军属不出夫，调皮户不出夫，老实农民的负担太重。这种不合理现象，已引起群众的不满，因而拨夫出勤越多越困难。根据这些情况，该县现正积极进行整顿。一方面登记青、壮、老年、军属等各有多少人，多少牲口；一方面召开群众会，说明出勤办法和执行战勤任务的光荣。然后在群众大会上将登记的项目向大家宣布，通过年龄榜。最后再根据怎样结合生产，将四种任务队编制起来，同时确定对军属的代耕户（按代耕条例）。现在已整理起来的十一个村总计：长勤夫七百八十二人，短勤夫八百三十四人，牲口编为一、二等，共二百三十九个。各村民兵也同时进行了整顿，进行了两次至四次的教育。一区六个村并进行了担架演习检阅。各村群众对这次战勤整顿都很满意。如黄湾村张贵说：“从前谁老实即谁去。这回就合理了，以后再叫我去我也没话说了。”还有的群众说：“这么以前有些农户打算卖牲口的，也不再抢着卖了。”
