Why Study the History of Social Development?

　　Eliminating the Deception of Ruling Class History

　　In the past, when I studied history in bourgeois schools, I heard many historical stories passed down by the ruling class, such as: Huang Chao's "rebellion," the Boxer Rebellion, and so on. ... The bourgeoisie said these were: "Great events under heaven, unity after a long period of division, division after a long period of unity," as if this were the law of social development. They cleverly used these few words to gloss over many class struggles in Chinese history. What kind of society were each of these dynasties? Were Hong Xiuquan and Li Zicheng "bandits" in "rebellion" or righteous peasant revolutionaries? We must figure this out, otherwise it will be impossible to have a thorough understanding of the current Chinese society and the nature of the revolution. But this prerequisite requires knowing the general laws of social development. Many comrades, after reading the history of social development, feel that it is all about Western Europe, such as Greece and Rome, and has no connection with China. But this is just a difference in specific names and places, the speed of time, and the length of the process. Whether it's Rome or China, in short, it cannot escape the general laws of human social development.

　　When I was a child, I unconsciously did some labor occasionally, and my aunt often said to me: "That's something for the underlings to do, it's lowly! How can you do it!" There are countless examples like this. These ruling-class ideas are deeply rooted in my mind, so that even after many years of revolutionary tempering, I still cannot completely eradicate them, and many exploitative ideas are still unconscious to this day. This is because we do not have a clear understanding of the historical roots of exploitative consciousness, so we cannot distinguish and criticize it. After studying the history of social development, I deeply realized this point. When many things are associated, I suddenly understand that it is not that I am "naturally" "noble," but that the rulers have always used this theory to conceal their unearned gains and specialized exploitation of others. Only by dividing "lowly" and "above" can they maintain their ruling class status, so that we can inherit their mantle and continue to rule others. Everyone can find a lot of these facts if they think about them carefully. Therefore, we must first study the history of social development, recognize the ugliness and shamelessness of the ruling class from the distant history, and find out the laws of class struggle, so that we can thoroughly recognize the importance of our position, the meaning of the revolution, and eliminate all wrong ideas.

　　One Must Understand Society Before Transforming It

　　My most beloved - People's Daily, I am infinitely delighted that it is willing to help readers in various places to study with the greatest effort and increase the learning discussion column. So I am willing to actively participate in the discussion of why we should study the history of social development first? This is how I understand it: Before answering, let me ask a question first, isn't everything we do in revolutionary work for the purpose of transforming society? If it is for the purpose of transforming society, then the various different societies are what revolutionaries must first understand. What kind of society are we transforming? What kind of society do we want to transform it into? Why? How are these various different societies produced? Why is the new society bound to win? Deep research into these questions in the history of social development will definitely provide a large part of the solution. If we don't understand the above questions, then our revolution may become blind, which will definitely have an impact on revolutionary work. Understanding the laws of social development and the inevitability of its internal contradictions and struggles is a true understanding of the revolution; with a clear understanding, there can be a strong revolutionary will; with a strong revolutionary will, there can be great strength. Using this strength as our outlook on life, this outlook on life will guide us to fight for a bright and rational society - a New Democratic society, a socialist society, a communist society. From this point of view, although the revolutionary situation is developing rapidly and various tasks are tense and busy, studying the history of social development is still necessary.

　　It Guided Me to Revolution

　　Ten years ago, the flames of anti-Japanese guerrilla warfare were burning everywhere. At that time, I was still a young student who had just run out from an exploitative family and bourgeois education. In addition to a patriotic enthusiasm, there were many contradictions in my thinking - I still had a blind faith in the traitor Chiang Kai-shek; at the same time, I was influenced by the books and periodicals of the Life Bookstore, and I yearned for the socialist society of the Soviet Union. After reading On Protracted War, I admired Chairman Mao very much. But I had no understanding of the reality of society at that time, and I didn't understand what class was or what exploitation was; I thought that the industry in my family was earned by the "sweat" of my ancestors, and that lending money, renting out land, and hiring workers were "legitimate" social "order," which had been the case since ancient times. But at the same time, there was still a "pity" for the poor peasants in some petty-bourgeois thinking... If someone had asked at that time: "Where is China going?" "Where is the world going?" Then I could only shake my head and say: "I don't know."

　　In the spring of 1938, a comrade gave me a copy of "The History of Social Development" and a copy of "Political Economy," which I read enthusiastically for several nights. At this time, I felt like I had entered a new world, and curiosity aroused my interest in research. Labor created man, and labor created everything in society. Since ancient times, barren land has been transformed into fertile land, all as a result of labor. It made me realize that it was not legitimate for landlord families like mine to occupy land without laboring. I understood the laws of social development that the old society was bound to perish and the new society was bound to come, and I was determined to fight to the end for the realization of communism.

　　Since then, I began to embark on the revolutionary journey. For ten years, in the dark years of long-term enemy and puppet rule, in the harsh guerrilla environment, and at the critical moment of life-and-death struggle in front of the enemy, it—the history of social development—has always illuminated my direction, strengthened my will, and overcome any ideological wavering.

　　In the vigorous land reform struggle, it—the history of social development—has always guided me and helped me through another historical test, making me understand the need to rely on the masses even further.

　　Today, ten years later, with the rapid progress of the revolutionary victory, reviewing the history of social development is like meeting an old friend again. It is unfamiliar, yet intimate, and further clarifies my views. Looking back on the ten years, they have passed in an instant, and I have stepped into a brand-new society from ideals. In the future construction of New Democracy, it—the history of social development—will continue to guide me towards the ideal of human society—a communist society. (Bo Sheng)

　　Reading the History of Social Development Clarified Two Concepts for Me

　　From ten years of practical struggle, I learned about landlords and peasants, and that without completely eliminating the feudal system of exploitation, the peasants' productivity could not be improved, and society could not move forward. But there was one problem that could not be solved, which was the left-right swing in the implementation of policies. Sometimes I felt that I was handling things very carefully in accordance with the Party's policies (for example, calculating the rent and interest of landlords according to the laws and regulations). But the result was often contrary to the interests of the peasants. After reviewing the lessons, I felt that I should be sincere and wholeheartedly serve the peasants and handle affairs according to the peasants' opinions, so I abandoned the Party's policies. For a while, it looked like a vigorous and dynamic scene, and the masses also rose up. I thought, this should be right, shouldn't it? But unexpectedly, it was "left" again. What is the standard of policy? I couldn't figure it out for a long time. I found the answer in the history of social development: The basic class contradiction in feudal society is between the peasants and the landlords. The peasants must carry out revolution as the strength of a class, and the landlords must also be eliminated as a class. This is a cruel class struggle. Therefore, without mobilizing the masses, and if the workers leave the peasant ranks and act as a mediator to settle accounts with the landlords, this historical task cannot be completed. Similarly, abandoning the leadership of the proletariat in land reform, not clearly analyzing the demands of the masses, doing whatever the masses want, and forgetting that the ultimate purpose of all revolutions is to develop production, and forgetting that infringing on middle peasants, infringing on industry and commerce, and physically eliminating landlords are all destructive to productivity, not only cannot push society forward, but also violate the laws of social development. Understanding the policy on a scientific and material basis thus improves the consciousness of implementing the policy. This is the first benefit.

　　During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Party implemented the policy of rent reduction and interest reduction. It was not until the Japanese surrender in 1945 that the equal distribution of land was implemented. I realized a truth from the practice of mass struggle, and I believed that from the perspective of the rapid and thorough elimination of feudal demands, the policy of equal distribution of land was fully in line with the demands and wishes of the peasants. Then I thought: Why wasn't this policy implemented earlier? If it was delayed at the beginning of the War of Resistance Against Japan for the sake of the KMT-CPC cooperation, it should have been implemented after the situation changed in 1940! I couldn't figure out the decision made by the central government that the new areas should still implement the policy of rent reduction and interest reduction, and after reading about Hong Xiuquan's Northern Expedition of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, one of which was to completely defeat the feudal rulers in the countryside, open warehouses to provide relief, and rescue the people from suffering, I became even more suspicious of today's policies. After reading the history of social development, I realized that this is called cutting off history and viewing problems in isolation from specific conditions. When fire had not yet been invented, humans could only live a nomadic life. When bows and arrows had not yet been invented, there could be no division of labor between men and women. If one laughs at the ancients from the perspective of modern people, it can only prove the stupidity of modern people, but cannot prove the foolishness of the ancients. Today's Party is a Party armed with Marxism-Leninism. It has the ability to consciously grasp the laws of social development and how to promote the advancement of the revolution. The policies it formulates cannot transcend historical conditions and the realities of objective struggle. The policy of rent reduction and interest reduction during the War of Resistance Against Japan once greatly increased the enthusiasm of the peasants and united all classes to persist in extremely cruel struggles. This achievement and experience must be affirmed. As for the later experience proving that the method of equal distribution of land is good, it is because the situation is different from what it was at that time. It would not have been good to propose the method of equal distribution at that time. As for the issue of implementing the policy of rent reduction and interest reduction in the new areas, it is naturally impossible to compare it with the experience of the consolidated areas. (Because the mass awareness, the balance of power, and other conditions are different.) Therefore, I think the second benefit of studying the history of social development is that it can teach you a historical way of looking at problems. If you want to solve problems with a super-historical method, that is subjectivism. The treasure of Marxism-Leninism is not a "magic book" that cannot be deduced, but a science. Science must solve problems according to the material conditions of a certain history. (Ding Kun)

　　Understanding the Party's Line and Policies from Studying Basic Theory

　　Studying the book "A Brief History of Social Development" can enable us to theoretically understand the correctness of the Party's line and policies and overcome the habit of learning from experience. It enables us to use a scientific and historical perspective to analyze and criticize various distorted arguments about social development derived from idealism or mechanical materialism (such as religion, superstition, and fascist reactionary theories), and to correctly understand the laws of social and historical development; thereby understanding that the birth and development of the working class and its political parties, and all revolutionary movements led by it, are the inevitable trend of the development of the real world, in line with the laws of social progress, and therefore are the basis for inevitable success and inevitable victory. Understanding these things will further strengthen our revolutionary outlook on life and the world, and increase our determination to serve the working people to the end. In addition, it can also enable us to objectively and comprehensively understand the nature, tasks, characteristics, and development prospects of the current Chinese revolutionary movement from the laws of the entire social development, and what general line and general policy the Party should determine in this movement, and why such a general line and general policy should be adopted. Now we only know the importance of learning policies and lines, but how should we learn them? Should we learn from piecemeal and isolated experience, or should we start from the basic theory of revolution? I think the latter method is correct and effective. Otherwise, only studying policies on the basis of policies, or only connecting them with the actual situation of a certain time and place, is very easy to form a narrow empirical learning method, which will not achieve any results.

　　Enables Us to Establish a Revolutionary Outlook on Life

　　Learning Discussion Editor: The rulers of the old society, using political, cultural, religious and other tools, instilled "fatalism" as the eternal golden rule, so that the vast working masses were trapped in the tragic circle of "fate", allowing them to be exploited and insulted. The history of social development is a powerful tool to eliminate this poison. It tells us: how society is developing, where the direction of progress is, and the position and role of the working masses in social development. It also tells us: everyone exists as a member of society, with their own responsibilities and roles.

　　Truly understanding the history of social development, we will not lose our way in the turbulent waves of struggle, and it will help us understand the Party's policies and be a powerful assistant for us to improve our work based on specific circumstances. Of course, the history of social development is not a "treasure box" for solving all problems, but it is indeed a basic common sense that a historical materialist should have, and it can help us establish a correct revolutionary outlook on life.

### 为什么要学习社会发展史？

　　为什么要学习社会发展史？
  　破除了统治阶级历史对我的蒙蔽
    过去在资产阶级学校里读历史，听了不少统治阶级流传下来的历史故事，如：黄巢“造反”，义和团之乱等等。……资产阶级说这些是：“天下大事，合久必分，分久必合”，似乎这就是社会发展的规律，他们巧妙的把中国历史上许多阶级斗争，就这么用几句话轻描淡写的掩饰过去了。究竟各朝各代都是些什么社会？洪秀全、李自成是“流寇”的“造反”还是正义的农民革命？我们必须弄清楚，不然就对当前中国的社会及革命性质不可能透彻的了解。但这个先决条件又必须知道社会发展的一般规律。很多同志看了社会发展史，觉得都是希腊、罗马等西欧的事，与中国没联系，但这不过是具体的人名地点的不同，时间的快慢，过程的长短而已。不管罗马也好，中国也好，总而言之，都逃不出这个人类社会发展的一般规律。
    小的时候，自己无意识的偶然劳动一下，姨母常对我说：“那是底下人做的事情，下贱！你怎么能做！”诸如这类的事不胜枚举。这些统治阶级的意识根深蒂固的种在脑子里，使我虽经过多少年的革命锻炼，仍然不能完全铲除，而且有很多剥削意识到今天都不自觉。这些都是由于我们对剥削意识的历史根源，认识得不清楚，所以无法区别和批判它。我学习了社会发展史后，就深深体会到这点。很多事情联想起来，才恍然大悟，不是我“天生”“高贵”，而是统治者一贯的用这个理论来掩饰自己应不劳而获，专门剥削别人，只有划出“低下”和“上头”来，才可以维持他们统治阶级的地位，使我们继承他们的衣钵，继续统治别人。这些事实好好思索一下，每个人都可以找出很多。所以我们必须首先学习了社会发展史，从悠远的历史上认清统治阶级的丑恶无耻，找出阶级斗争的规律，才能彻底认清自己所处的地位的重要，革命的意义，破除一切错误的观念。

　　先要认识社会才能改造社会
    我最敬爱的——人民日报，愿以最大的努力帮助各地读者学习，增设学习讨论栏，是使我无限欢欣的。所以我愿积极参加讨论为什么要先学习社会发展史？我是这样理解的：在答复以前我先试问一句，我们所做的一切革命工作不是为了改造社会吗？如果是为了改造社会，那么各种不同的社会便是革命者必须首先要明白的。我们改造的是什么社会？要改造成什么样的社会？为什么？各种不同的社会是怎样产生的。新社会为什么必然胜利呢？以上这些问题在社会发展史中去深刻的研究，定能获得大部解决。如果不了解上面这些问题，那我们革命就可能会变成盲目的，对革命工作一定是有影响的。明白了社会发展的规律及其内部的矛盾和斗争的必然性，那才是对革命有了真正的认识；有了明白的认识，才能有坚强的革命意志；有了坚强的革命意志，才能生出极大的力量来。用这种力量来作我们的人生观，这种人生观，就会指引我们为光明合理的社会——新民主主义社会，社会主义社会，共产主义社会——而奋斗。由此看来，虽革命形势正在迅速发展，各种工作紧张忙碌，但学习社会发展史仍是必要的。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（正定七区南豆村小学教员李丰）
  　它指引我走向革命
    十年前，抗日的游击战火在到处燃烧。当时我还是一个由剥削家庭与资产阶级教育下刚刚跑出来的青年学生。除了一腔爱国热情外，思想上矛盾重重——对卖国贼蒋介石还存在着一种盲目的信仰；同时又受生活书店书刊的影响，向往着苏联的社会主义社会。读了论持久战，对毛主席非常钦仰。但对于当时的现实社会，则毫无认识，根本不懂得什么是阶级，什么是剥削；认为自己家中的产业，是祖先的“血汗”换来，放债、出租、雇工是“合法”的社会“秩序”，自古以来就是如此。但同时思想上也还存在着一些小资产阶级对贫苦农民的一种“可怜”……假使当时有人问：“中国要往那里去？”“世界要往那里去？”那只有摇摇头说：“不清楚”。
    一九三八年的春天，一个同志给了我一本“社会发展史”和一本“政治经济学”，我热情的读了几个晚上。这时，我恍如进入了一个新的世界，由好奇而引起了研究的兴趣。劳动创造了人，劳动创造了社会上的一切，自古荒地变良田，都是劳动的结果。使我认识到象自己这样的地主家庭不劳动而占有土地，原来并不是合法的，懂得了旧社会必然灭亡与新社会必然来临的社会发展规律，并下定决心要为共产主义的实现而奋斗到底。
    从此，我开始走上了革命的征途。十年来，在敌伪长期统治的黑暗岁月里，在艰苦的游击环境里，在敌人面前生与死斗争的紧急关头，它——社会发展史，始终照耀着我的方向，坚定着我的意志，战胜了思想上任何的动摇。
    在轰轰烈烈的土地改革斗争中，它——社会发展史，又始终指引着我，渡过了历史上又一次的考验，使我懂得了更进一步的依靠群众。
    十年后的今天，革命胜利飞速的进展，重温社会发展史，好象故友重逢，是生疏，又是亲切，使我的观点得到进一步的明确。回顾十年的时光，瞬息掠过，我已由理想而踏进了一个崭新的社会。在今后新民主主义的建设中，它——社会发展史，将继续引导着我走向人类社会的理想——共产主义社会。  （博生）
  　读了社会发展史使我明确了两个观念
    从十年来的实践斗争中知道了地主与农民，知道了不彻底消灭封建的剥削制度，农民的生产力就无法提高，社会也就无法前进等问题。但有一个问题不能解决，就是执行政策中的左右摇摆，有时候自己觉得是很慎重地按照党的政策办事了，（比如按照法令条文去算地主的租息。）但做的结果，却常是违背了农民利益。检讨了教训之后，觉得应该诚心诚意为农民，按农民的意见办事，于是就放弃了党的政策，一时看轰轰烈烈，群众也起来了，自己想，这可该算对了吧？不料却又“左”了。政策的标准是什么呢？长期想不通，在社会发展史里我找到了解答：封建社会的基本阶级矛盾是农民和地主，农民要做为一个阶级的力量去进行革命，地主也必须被当做一个阶级去消灭，这是一个惨酷的阶级斗争，因之不发动群众，工作人员离开了农民的队伍，做为一个调解人去和地主算帐，是不能完成这个历史任务的。同样的，在土改中放弃无产阶级的领导，不清醒地分析群众要求，群众要怎样办就怎样办，忘记了一切革命的最后目的都是为了发展生产，忘记了侵犯中农，侵犯工商业，以及肉体上消灭地主都是对生产力的破坏，不但不能把社会推向前进，同样也违反了社会的发展规律。把政策提高到科学的唯物的基础上去理解，因而就提高了执行政策的自觉。这是第一个好处。
    抗日战争时期党执行的是减租减息政策，一九四五年日寇投降后，才实行了平分土地，而我自己从群众斗争的实践中体会了一个道理，认为从迅速彻底消灭封建要求的意义上讲，平分土地的方针与政策是完全符合于农民的要求与意愿的。接着就联想到：为什么这个政策不早些实行？如果说抗日战争开始时为了国共合作问题而缓行的话，到一九四○年情况变化后也应该实行呀！对中央所决定的新区仍要实行减租减息这个决定，就更想不开，看了太平天国洪秀全的北征中有一条是彻底打垮农村的封建统治者，开仓济贫，解救人民痛苦，就更怀疑起今天的政策来了。读了社会发展史，我才知道了这叫做割断历史脱离具体条件看问题。当火还没有发明的时候人类就只有过游牧的生活，当弓箭还没有发明的时候，人类就不可能有男女分工，如果以今人的眼光笑古人，那只能证明今人之蠢，而不能证明古人之愚。今天的党是有马列主义武装起来的党，对社会的发展规律，对如何推动革命前进是有能力自觉的掌握的，它所规定的政策是不能超越历史条件与客观斗争的现实可能性的，抗日战争时期的减租减息政策，曾经大大的提高了农民的积极性，并团结了各阶层坚持了极残酷的斗争，这个成绩与经验是必须肯定的，至于从后来的经验证明平分土地的办法好，是因为以后的情况与当时不同了，当时如果提出平分的办法是不好的。至于新区实行减租减息政策的问题，自然不能以巩固地区的经验来类比。（因为群众觉悟，力量对比等条件都不同。）因此我觉得学习社会发展史的第二个好处是能学习一个历史的看问题的方法。如果想用超历史的方法解决问题，那就是主观主义，马列主义的宝藏不是“天书”，不能推算，而是科学，科学就要按历史的一定的物质条件去解决问题的。  （丁昆）
  　从学习基本理论中体会党的路线政策
    学习“社会发展简史”一书，可以使我们从理论上认识党的路线政策的正确性，克服经验主义的学习习惯。使我们学习用科学的、历史的眼光去分析、批判来源于唯心论或机械唯物论的种种对社会发展的歪曲的论调（如宗教、迷信和法西斯的反动学说等），正确的认识社会历史的发展规律；从而了解到工人阶级及其政党的诞生、发展，和它领导劳动人民的一切革命运动，乃是现实世界发展的必然趋势，是合乎社会进行的规律，也就是必然成功必然胜利的根据。了解这些，就更加坚定我们革命的人生观与世界观，提高自己为劳动人民服务到底的决心。除此，还能使我们从整个社会发展的规律中，客观全面地了解现阶段中国革命运动的性质、任务、特点及发展前途，和党在这一运动中应确定什么样的总路线、总政策，以及为什么要采取这样的总路线与总政策。现在我们光知道学习政策路线的重要，但是应该怎样学习呢？片断的孤立的经验主义的学呢？还是从革命基本理论学起呢？我以为后一种方法是正确有效的。否则只是就政策学习政策，或仅仅联系些一时一地的实际情况，都是很容易形成狭隘经验主义的学习方法，是收不到什么效果的。　　
　　　　　　　　　　　　　（和平医院程予）
  　使我们建立革命的人生观
    学习讨论编者：旧社会的统治者，御用着政治、文化、宗教等工具，灌输着“宿命论”是永世不变的金科玉律，使广大的劳动群众，辗转在“命运”悲剧的圈子里，任凭他们剥削与侮辱。社会发展史，就是消除这种毒素的有力工具。它告诉我们：社会是在怎样发展着，那里是前进的方向，劳动群众在社会发展中的地位与作用。更告诉我们：每个人都是做为社会的一员而存在着，有着自己的负责和作用。
    真正了解了社会发展史，在惊涛骇浪的斗争中，就不致于迷失方向，帮助我们认识党的政策，是我们根据具体情况改进工作的有力助手。当然，社会发展史并不是解决一切问题的“百宝箱”，可是，它确是一个历史唯物主义者应有的起码常识，能够帮助我们建立正确的革命的人生观。　　　　　　（董鲁）
