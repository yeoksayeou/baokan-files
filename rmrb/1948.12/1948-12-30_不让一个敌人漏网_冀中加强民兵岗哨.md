　　Not Letting a Single Enemy Slip Through
  　Jizhong Strengthens Militia Sentry Posts
    [Jizhong 24th Dispatch] The Jizhong People's Armed Forces Department, in order to support the Northeast and North China Liberation Armies in liberating Ping and Tianjin, especially to maintain rear area security, protect transportation, and rigorously guard sentry posts to prevent a single enemy from slipping through, specifically orders all levels of People's Armed Forces cadres in the region to: Organize militia squads to guard the main transportation lines in our region. Each sub-district and county should calculate the actual length in li of the routes passing through its territory and assign militia to guard them. Food and supplies will be provided according to the standard for front-line support laborers, paid from war grain expenditures. After the militia squads are formed, they will be directly commanded by the county armed forces department. Each squad will patrol and inspect the section it guards, and they should carry tools such as shovels, picks, and pliers to repair the roads and connect the sections at any time. Larger projects that the militia squads cannot repair will be undertaken by the county, district, and villages mobilizing civilian laborers. Cadres at all levels must also earnestly supervise and inspect to ensure serious implementation and completion. Those who violate our regulations for maintaining transportation and disrupt the law will be handed over to the government above the district level for legal action in accordance with the punishment measures decided by the Jizhong Administrative Office. In addition to the designated trunk lines, other lines will continue to be protected by militia self-defense forces in sections, as previously instructed. Local areas along rivers, bridges, ferries, and important village and town intersections should have village or nearby village militia self-defense teams take turns guarding, and in conjunction with public security departments, investigate suspicious passersby, creating a mass dragnet to capture the ringleaders and officers and soldiers of the Chiang Kai-shek and Fu Zuoyi bandit troops attempting to escape in disguise, and strengthen battlefield security. Utilize natural terrains such as rivers, bridges, and ferries for blockades, ensuring that not a single enemy slips through. If small groups of enemies are encountered, bravely surround and attack them to achieve annihilation; if large groups of enemies are encountered and the militia cannot annihilate them, they should both stall the enemy and report to the troops or unite with neighboring villages to encircle and suppress them to achieve complete annihilation. If single or a few disguised and fleeing enemies are discovered, they should be immediately handed over to higher authorities or the army and government.
    After receiving orders, each sub-district and county should immediately deploy and implement the above tasks, and complete the deployment and take action uniformly before the 25th of this month. We hope that all our cadres will take practical responsibility, educate the militia and self-defense team members to earnestly implement them, and not be careless, delayed, or delayed. In future inspections, those who perform well will be commended and rewarded, and those who violate the rules will be held accountable and punished. We hope that everyone will follow these instructions carefully.
