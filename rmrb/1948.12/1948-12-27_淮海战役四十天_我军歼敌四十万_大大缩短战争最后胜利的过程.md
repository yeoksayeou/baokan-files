　　Xinhua News Agency, Huaihai Front, 23rd: The Huaihai Campaign, which is of decisive significance to the fate of Kuomintang rule, has achieved a tremendous victory for the People's Liberation Army in the forty days from its commencement on the 7th of last month to the 17th of this month. In this short period, the Kuomintang army lost a total of three corps (Huang Botao, Huang Wei, and Sun Yuanliang), fourteen armies, thirty-four divisions, and one rapid column. In addition, the Qiu Qingquan and Li Mi corps have also suffered significant losses. This means that most of the Kuomintang's entire force used on the Huaihai battlefield has been annihilated. According to incomplete statistics, the total number of enemy troops lost is around 400,000.

　　In the past forty days, the development of this campaign can be divided into two stages. The first stage began on the 7th and ended on the 22nd with the complete annihilation of the Huang Botao Corps. At the start of this campaign, the East China Field Army, advancing from southern Shandong, quickly cut into the Xuzhou-Haizhou section of the Longhai Railway and the outskirts of Xuzhou, separating the Kuomintang's Xuzhou "Suppression Headquarters" from the Huang Botao Corps east of Xuzhou. It surrounded one army and two divisions of the Huang Botao Corps in Bowan, one division in the Cao Bajiao area, and the remaining four armies and seven divisions in the narrow area of Nianzhuang. After sixteen days of combat, by the 22nd of last month, the Liberation Army, while completely annihilating the Huang Botao Corps, resolutely blocked the enemy's Qiu Qingquan and Li Mi corps, which were attempting to relieve the Huang Botao Corps from Xuzhou, preventing them from approaching the surrounded Huang Botao Corps and inflicting heavy losses on them. At the same time, on the 8th of last month, the Liberation Army won over one army and one and a half divisions of the enemy's Feng Yezhi's unit to stage a battlefield uprising under the leadership of Generals He Jicheng and Feng Kexia. On the 13th of last month, the Liberation Army annihilated one army and two divisions of the enemy's Sun Liangcheng's unit and recovered Suining. After annihilating the 181st Division of Liu Ruming's unit on the 7th of last month, the Central Plains Field Army captured Suxian on the 16th of last month and annihilated the 148th Division of the enemy's 25th Army. In this first stage, the Kuomintang army lost a total of eighteen regular divisions, with a force of 178,000 men.

　　The second stage began on the 23rd of last month and ended on the 17th of this month. The main achievements of this stage were the annihilation of the Huang Wei Corps and the Sun Yuanliang Corps, the encirclement of the Qiu Qingquan and Li Mi corps, and the repulse of the Li Yannian and Liu Ruming corps. When the Liberation Army surrounded the Huang Botao Corps, Chiang Kai-shek realized the critical situation and hurriedly dispatched the Huang Wei Corps from southern Henan to reinforce Xuzhou. However, the Huang Wei Corps had just advanced to the southwest of Suxian in northern Anhui when it was tightly surrounded by the Liberation Army in a narrow area between the Hui River and the Fei River. Thus, the second major encirclement and annihilation battle began. In order to rescue the Huang Wei Corps, Chiang Kai-shek ordered the Qiu Qingquan, Li Mi, and Sun Yuanliang corps to advance south from Xuzhou, and the Li Yannian and Liu Ruming corps to advance north from Bengbu, but they were all met with strong resistance from the Liberation Army. Seeing that the overall situation in Xuzhou was lost, Chiang Kai-shek, in order to preserve his last bit of capital, ordered Du Yuming, deputy commander of the Xuzhou "Suppression Headquarters," to command the Qiu Qingquan, Li Mi, and Sun Yuanliang corps to abandon Xuzhou on the 1st of this month and flee westward. But the Liberation Army immediately caught up with them, and on the 4th, in an area less than twenty li in length and width northeast of Yongcheng, surrounded the three corps. Not long after the encirclement battle began, the Sun Yuanliang Corps was completely wiped out. By the evening of the 15th, all four armies, eleven divisions, and one rapid column of the Huang Wei Corps had been annihilated, except for the 110th Division of the 85th Army, which revolted under the leadership of General Liao Yunzhou. The three corps led by Du Yuming had also lost the entire two armies and four divisions of the Sun Yuanliang Corps, and with the losses of other units, more than 80,000 men had been eliminated by the 12th. The fate of the remaining defeated soldiers and generals, after the annihilation of the Huang Wei Corps, was not far from total destruction. The Li Yannian and Liu Ruming corps, six armies and fifteen divisions, which came from Bengbu to "relieve the siege," had traveled for thirteen days since the 2nd of this month, advancing less than fifty li. Not only were they still more than sixty li away from the Huang Wei Corps, but they also suffered heavy casualties. On the 17th, these two corps, in order to save their lives, quickly fled back south of the Huai River at a speed of one hundred li per day. In addition, in the second stage, the Liberation Army also captured Lingbi on the 26th of last month, annihilating one enemy division, and recovered Huaiyin on the 3rd of this month, Huaian and Baoying on the 9th, Xinghua on the 13th, Xuyi on the 14th, Binghui (Tianchang) on the 15th, and Gaoyou on the 16th. The vast area north of the line from the Huai River to Binghui, Gaoyou, and Dongtai, east to the Yellow Sea and west to Shandong, has been completely liberated.

　　In the past forty days, as a result of the Liberation Army's massive annihilation of the enemy, from the Huaihai Campaign to the present, the Liberation Army has controlled the entire Longhai Railway east of Shanzhou and the entire Jinpu Railway north of Bengbu to south of Tianjin. The great Chinese People's Liberation Army, in this historically significant decisive battle, has once again proven that it is brave, good at fighting, and invincible. It has annihilated three enemy corps and is in the process of encircling and annihilating another two enemy corps. Chiang Kai-shek has suffered a decisive blow. Because of the victory of the Huaihai Campaign, the reactionary Kuomintang regime in Nanjing is on the verge of collapse and cannot survive much longer. The great victory in the past forty days of the Huaihai Campaign, together with the great victories of the Liberation Army on other battlefields, greatly shortens the process of the Chinese revolutionary war reaching its final victory. All the developments prove the prediction of the person in charge of the CCP Central Committee on the 14th of last month, that the goal of fundamentally overthrowing the reactionary Kuomintang rule may be achieved in about a year from now. The final and complete liberation of China is getting closer and closer.

　　淮海战役四十天
  　我军歼敌四十万
  　大大缩短战争最后胜利的过程
    【新华社淮海前线二十三日电】对于国民党统治命运有决定意义的淮海战役，从上月七日揭幕起，到本月十七日止，一共四十天中，人民解放军已经得到了巨大的胜利。国民党军在这短时期内，整军整师丧失的一共是黄伯韬、黄维、孙元良三个兵团、十四个军、三十四个师、一个快速纵队。除此以外，邱清泉、李澜两兵困也已经遭受了重大的损失。这就是说，国民党用于淮海战场的全部兵力，已经被歼灭了一大半。根据不完全的统计，敌军损失的总人数约在四十万上下。
    四十天来，这一战役的发展，可分为两个阶段。从七日战役开始，到二十二日全部歼灭了黄伯韬兵团，为第一阶段。这个战役刚开始，由鲁南进军的华东野战军一下子就插到陇海路徐海段和徐州外围，将国民党徐州“剿总”和徐州以东的黄伯韬兵团割裂开来，把黄伯韬兵团的一个军两个师包围在菠湾，一个师包围在曹八集地区，其余四个军七个师都包围在碾庄的狭小地区。经过十六天的战斗，到了上月廿二日，解放军一面全部歼灭了黄伯韬兵团，一面坚强地阻击了由徐州出发企图解救黄伯韬兵团的敌军邱清泉、李强两个兵团，使他们不仅始终无法接近被围的黄伯韬兵团，并且遭受到惨重损失。同时，在上月八日解放军争取了敌军冯冶安部的一个军和一个半师在何基澄飞克侠两将军领导下举行战场起义。上月十三日，解放军歼灭了敌军孙良诚部一个军两个师，收复了睢宁。中原野战军上月七日歼灭了刘汝明部一百八十一师以后，上月十六日又攻占宿县，歼灭敌军二十五军的一百四十八师。在这头一个阶段中，国民党军一共丧失了正规军十八个整师，兵力十七万八千人。
    第二个阶段，由上月二十三日开始，到本月十七日结束。这个阶段的主要战绩是消灭了黄维兵团和孙元良兵团，包围了邱清泉、李澜两兵团，击退了李延年、刘汝明兵团。当解放军包围了黄伯韬兵团的时候，蒋介石发觉形势危殆，急忙调豫南的黄维兵团增援徐州。但是黄维兵团刚刚进到皖北宿县西南地区，就被解放军紧紧包围在浍河与淝河中间一块狭小地区。于是，第二个大的围歼战开始了。蒋介石为了援救黄维兵团，命令邱清泉、李澜、孙元良三个兵团由徐州南下，又命令李廷年、刘汝明两兵团由蚌埠北上，但是都受到了解放军强有力的阻击。蒋介石看到徐州大势已去，为保存他最后的一点本钱，就命令徐州“剿总”副司令杜聿明指挥邱清泉、李澜、孙元良三个兵团，在本月一日放弃徐州，向西逃跑。但是解放军马上就追上了他们，四号就在永城东北纵横不到二十里的地区，把这三个兵团团团围困了起来。围歼战开始不久，孙元良兵团就全军覆没。到了十五日晚上，黄维兵团四个军，十一个师，一个快速纵队，除了八十五军一百一十师在廖运周将军率领下起义之外，已经全部被歼灭。杜聿明所率领的三个兵团，也已失掉孙元良兵团全部两个军四个师，加上其他各部的损失，到十二日为止，已经被消灭了八万多人。剩下的那些残兵败将，在黄维兵团被歼之后，其全部覆没的命运也已经不远了。由蚌埠来“解围”的李延年、刘汝明两兵团六个军、十五个师，从本月二日走起，走了十三天，前进不足五十里，不但离开黄维兵团还有六十几里，而且受了重大的杀伤。到了十七日，这两个兵团为了逃命起见，以一天一百里的速度赶快逃回了淮河以南。此外，在第二个阶段中，解放军还在上月二十六日攻克灵璧，歼灭敌人一个师，又在本月三日收复淮阴，九日收复淮安、宝应，十三日收复兴化，十四日收复盱眙，十五日收复炳辉（天长），十六日收复高邮。从淮河到炳辉、高邮、东台一线以北的广大地区，东至黄海，西至山东，都已经全部解放。
    在过去四十天中，由于解放军大量地歼灭敌军的结果，从淮海战役到现在，解放军已经控制了陕州以东的全部陇海铁路和蚌埠以北直到天津以南的全部津浦铁路。伟大的中国人民解放军，在这次有历史意义的决战中，再一次证明了它是英勇善战，无敌于天下了。它已经歼灭了敌人三个兵团，并且正在围歼敌人另外两个兵团。蒋介石遭受了决定性的打击。因为淮海战役的胜利，南京的国民党反动政权已经摇摇欲坠了，他已经不能再活多久了。淮海战役过去四十天中的伟大胜利和解放军在其他战场上的伟大胜利在一起，使中国革命战争达到最后胜利的过程大大缩短。一切事实的发展，都证明了上月十四日，中共中央负责人的预言，就是在今后一年左右时间内，可能达到根本上打倒国民党反动统治的目的。中国最后的全部的解放，已是越来越近了。
