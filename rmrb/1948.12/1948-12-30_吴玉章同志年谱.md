　　Chronological Biography of Comrade Wu Yuzhang
    1878——1948
    ——Written for Comrade Wu Yuzhang's 70th Birthday
    1878　Born on December 30th (i.e., the seventh day of the twelfth month of the lunar year Wuyin) in Shuangmiao Township, Rong County, Sichuan. The family was engaged in both farming and reading, with sufficient means to support themselves. His given name was Yongshan, and he was known as Yuzhang. His eldest brother was Yongkuang, known as Kuangshi; his second brother was Yongkun, known as Ziguang; both studied in Japan and joined the Tongmenghui (Chinese United League).
    1884　Age 6. Started reading. At that time, the events of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom were still circulating among the people. Imperialist aggression was intensifying, and China was losing its defenses. He often heard guests discussing current affairs, which had a significant impact on his later involvement in politics.
    1892　Age 14. Accompanied his second brother to Chengdu and entered Zunjing Academy. In May, they went to Jiading to take exams, but returned home due to their mother's death. He and his second brother stayed home to study. He loved history and deeply admired the patriotic and stirring works of Yue Fei's "Man Jiang Hong" and Wen Tianxiang's "Song of Righteousness." He especially admired the integrity of Huang Chunyao and Shi Kefa, martyrs of the late Ming Dynasty.
    1895　Age 17. The Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895 ended in defeat. Upon hearing the news, he was deeply saddened and indignant. He and his second brother encouraged each other to save the country and the people.
    1896　Age 18. Married Ms. You Binglian.
    1897　Age 19. After the defeat in the Sino-Japanese War, the corruption and incompetence of the Qing Dynasty were fully exposed. Imperialists clamored for leased territories and spheres of influence, threatening to partition China. With the country in dire straits, reformist ideas gradually became popular. After reading "Words of Warning in Times of Prosperity," "The Current Affairs Daily," "Mongolian Studies," and "Sichuan Studies," he embraced reformist thought.
    1898　Age 20. The Hundred Days' Reform. He actively promoted reformist ideas in the countryside and remained steadfast in his belief even after the failure of the reform. Daughter Chunlan was born.
    1900　Age 22. The Boxer Rebellion occurred. In Sichuan, there was the rebellion of Yu Manzi. Destroyed church relics flowed into the countryside, bringing many new things. He took the opportunity to promote reformist ideas. He united local youths, who deeply respected and loved him. Many of them later went to study in Japan and became revolutionaries. Son Zhenhuan was born. The Eight-Nation Alliance captured Beijing, and Emperor Guangxu and Empress Dowager Cixi fled to Xi'an.
    1901　Age 23. The Qing government signed the humiliating Treaty of Xin Chou with the Eight Powers. Tang Caichang, leader of the Baohuanghui (Protect the Emperor Society), launched an unsuccessful uprising in Wuhan and was killed.
    1902　Age 24. Liang Qichao's "New Citizen Journal" and "New Fiction" were published, and Yan Fu's translation of "Evolution and Ethics" was published. He was very excited to read them.
    1903　Age 25. He and his second brother went to Tokyo, Japan, to study. He negotiated with Okamoto Noriroku, the principal of Seijo Junior High School in Japan, to open a middle school class exclusively for Chinese students and enrolled in the class. He and other Sichuan students in Japan published "A Letter Encouraging Study Abroad," which led to a significant increase in the number of Sichuan students in Japan, many of whom became revolutionary cadres. In March of the same year, he participated in the "Anti-Russian Student Association," a movement by students in Japan demanding the withdrawal of Russian troops, which was later changed to the revolutionary Military-National Education Association. Zou Rong's "Revolutionary Army" was published, and he was deeply moved after reading it. At that time, Tokyo, Japan, was one of the centers of the Chinese revolution. Revolutionary anti-Manchu books and newspapers were everywhere. After reading "The Social Contract" and histories of European revolutions, he became dissatisfied with Kang Youwei and Liang Qichao's reformist doctrines and accepted the old democratic ideas of revolution against the Manchus and natural human rights.
    1904　Age 26. The Qing Dynasty implemented the abolition of the imperial examination system and the establishment of schools. Provinces sent normal school students to study in Japan, which greatly increased the number of Chinese students in Japan. The Russo-Japanese War ended in Japanese victory.
    1905　Age 27. He and Mr. Sun Yat-sen and other revolutionary comrades formed the Tongmenghui, which was the first revolutionary political party with theory and organization in Chinese history, leading and promoting the increasingly high revolutionary movement at that time. He participated in the anti-Japanese government's "Crackdown Rules" movement, uniting Chinese students in Japan. Life was hard. Tuition and board were difficult to pay, but he restrained himself and helped others, deeply moving his classmates. He accepted the Three Principles of the People, and his bourgeois democratic revolutionary thought became more concrete.
    1906　Age 28. He graduated from Seijo Middle School and was admitted to the Sixth Higher School in Okayama, Japan. In China, under the cruel exploitation and oppression of imperialism and the Qing government, there was economic panic, rural bankruptcy, the people's lives were deteriorating, and mass movements against excessive taxes were common. The revolutionary party's uprising in Liping failed.
    1907　Age 29. The Chaozhou-Huizhou and Qinlian uprisings, and the Battle of Zhennanguan all failed. That year, many revolutionaries in Japan were discouraged and disappointed. He and Li Zhaofu worked hard to unite Chinese students in Japan. He took a break from school and went to Tokyo to run "Sichuan Magazine" to promote revolution.
    1908　Age 30. "Sichuan Magazine" was seized by the Japanese government, and he was sentenced to six months in prison, which was suspended due to his student status. He returned to Okayama to resume his studies. The Hekou uprising failed, and Xu Xilin assassinated Enming. Some revolutionaries began to adopt assassination tactics. Feeling deeply the necessity of winning over the masses to participate in the revolution, he joined Sun Wu and others in uniting the Gelaohui, Triads, and Xiaoyouhui from various provinces to form the Gongjinhui. The Gongjinhui later played a significant role in the Sichuan Railway Protection Movement and the New Army in the Wuchang Uprising.
    1909　Age 31. Still studying in Okayama and engaged in revolutionary activities. Huang Fusheng, Yu Yunjing, Wang Jingwei and others plotted to assassinate the Prince Regent. He helped with the organization and preparation.
    1910　Age 32. He went to Beijing to rescue Huang and Wang, who were imprisoned, but failed. He went to Hong Kong and worked with Huang Xing, Yu Yunjing and others to plan the Guangzhou Uprising. He then returned to Japan to purchase military supplies.
    1911　Age 33. He participated in the Guangzhou March 29th Uprising. After the failure, he escaped back to Japan. In May, the Sichuan Railway Protection Movement expanded, and he was sent back to Sichuan by the Tongmenghui to work. In July, he returned to Rong County and helped Long Mingjian and Wang Zixiang lead the militia to attack Chengdu and the Qin Emperor Temple. After the failure, the militia returned to Rong County and declared independence. They then captured Weiyuan County and attacked Ziliujing. The situation stalemated. Just then, the Qing court sent Duan Fang to lead the New Army to suppress the uprising. He secretly went to Neijiang, contacted revolutionary comrades in the New Army to incite them to revolt. After hearing that the New Army had killed Duan Fang in Zizhou on October 5th as agreed, he launched an uprising in Neijiang on the 6th. On October 2nd, Chongqing was recovered and the Shu Military Government was established. On the 8th, the Sichuan Military Government was established in Chengdu, forming a situation of opposition between Chengdu and Chongqing. Comrade Wu Yuzhang arrived in Chongqing on October 14th, insisted on punishing the saboteurs, so that the Shu Military Government could be consolidated. He was then sent to Nanjing as a representative of Sichuan.
    1912　Age 34. On New Year's Day, the Republic of China was established, and Mr. Sun Yat-sen was elected as the provisional president. The provisional government was established in Nanjing. In mid-January, he arrived in Beijing and served as the secretary of the presidential palace. After the North-South Peace Agreement was reached, he was sent back to Sichuan in June to mediate the merger of Chengdu and Chongqing and to comfort the elders of Sichuan. He also established the Sichuan Branch of the Franco-Chinese Work-Study Society and sent a large number of young people to study in France. In August, he returned to Nanjing. Although the revolutionary army had won the victory, in order to achieve superficial unity, its leading members compromised with the feudal forces. After the North-South Peace Agreement was reached, Yuan Shikai seized power. The feudal warlords were able to maintain their rule, and imperialism could use them as tools to rule China. Thus, the Xinhai Revolution was aborted. The Tongmenghui disintegrated, and some of the upper echelons compromised with the old forces and formed the Kuomintang, losing its revolutionary nature.
    1913　Age 35. Yuan Shikai conspired to seize the fruits of the revolution, assassinated Song Jiaoren, and borrowed foreign debts without authorization. He actively advocated for the Kuomintang's four governors to denounce Yuan's illegality in a telegram to preemptively strike, but Huang Xing opposed it, and it failed. By the time Yuan issued the order to dismiss the four governors, the Second Revolution was launched too late, and it failed.
    After the failure of the Second Revolution, he continued to work for the revolution in Shanghai and was wanted by Yuan Shikai. In November, he went to France. Witnessing the abortion of the Xinhai Revolution, the Chinese people were again reduced to oppression by imperialism and the autocratic rule of feudal warlords. In his indignation, he approached anarchist thought, but he deeply felt its lack of organization and that it was just a fantasy.
    1914　Age 36. He arrived in France in January and later entered the Faculty of Law at the University of Paris to study political economy. In August, the First World War broke out.
    1915　Age 37. In France, together with Cai Yuanpei, Li Shizeng, Professor Oule of France, Member of Parliament Moud and others, he established the Sino-French Education Association to unite Chinese and Western cultures, and managed the Work-Study Society, serving as treasurer. The Work-Study Society sent thousands of students to France before and after, and cultivated many revolutionary cadres. Comrades Zhou Enlai, Wang Ruofei, Zhao Shiyan, Chen Yannian, Chen Yi and others all went to France to study through this program. Yuan Shikai signed the humiliating Twenty-One Demands, and with the support of imperialism, changed the republic to an empire. In December, Yunnan revolted against Yuan.
    1916　Age 38. At that time, it was rumored that British generals would lend money to Yuan. In January, he went to London to meet with a member of the British Socialist Party, requesting that he propose to the British Parliament not to lend money to Yuan Shikai. The loan was not successful. In June, Yuan died. Cai Yuanpei was appointed as the president of Peking University. He returned to China with him and went to Kunming to discuss with Tang Jiyao the development of the Sino-French Education Association.
    1917　Age 39. He ran a preparatory school for the Work-Study Society in Beijing and fought with the bureaucratic officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for the approval of the French recruitment of Chinese workers treaty. Duan Qirui pressured Li Yuanhong to dissolve the parliament. The members of parliament moved south and organized the Constitutional Protection Military Government in Guangzhou. Mr. Sun Yat-sen served as the Grand Marshal. In July, Zhang Xun entered Beijing, and his restoration failed. Duan Qirui regained power. At the end of the year, Xiong Kewu unified Sichuan and joined the Constitutional Protection Military Government. He was sent to Guangdong as a representative of Sichuan Province. The Russian October Revolution was victorious.
    1918　Age 40. The news of the victory of the October Revolution was received with great joy by progressive intellectuals. Socialist thought began to spread. Comrade Wu Yuzhang's Marxist scientific socialist thought was consolidated from then on. In March, Mr. Sun Yat-sen was forced to go to Shanghai. Yang Yongtai, Mo Rongxin and others supported Cen Chunxuan as the leader and reorganized the Constitutional Protection Military Government into a seven-president system.
    1919　Age 41. The May Fourth Movement occurred, and socialist thought spread more widely. After first reading books such as "The Extremists" (i.e., the Bolsheviks), he more specifically recognized this as the only way to completely eliminate domestic feudal forces and imperialist oppression, eliminate class exploitation, and transform Chinese society. Revolutionary activities became more active, traveling between Shanghai and Guangdong to assist with the work of publications such as "Save the Country Newspaper" and "The Laborer." (The former was run by students in Japan and opposed the Twenty-One Demands, and the latter was run by anarchists.) The North-South Peace Agreement failed. In October, he returned to Sichuan to mediate the affairs of the Sichuan Army and the Yunnan-Guizhou Army.
    1920　Age 42. Mediation failed. The Sichuan Army and the Yunnan-Guizhou Army went to war. In December, he went to Chongqing to prepare for the "Sichuan Provincial Autonomy Federation," published a declaration, and proposed twelve major programs such as "No work, no food," which was deeply appreciated by progressive people.
    1921　Age 43. On April 1st, the founding meeting of the "Sichuan Provincial Autonomy Federation" was held in Chongqing with great fanfare. In order to avoid the use of the military government, it was decided to hand over the power to formulate the provincial constitution to the Provincial Assembly and then end it immediately. He deeply felt the need for a political party with thorough revolutionary theory and iron discipline. Later, he was elected by the Provincial Assembly as a member of the Provincial Constitution Drafting Committee. Mr. Sun Yat-sen took office as the Extraordinary President. In July, the Communist Party of China held its first National Congress in Shanghai and was officially established. Comrade Yun Daiying secretly organized the Socialist Youth League in Sichuan.
    1922　Age 44. He served as the principal of Chengdu Higher Normal School. Comrade Yun Daiying was imprisoned in Luzhou. He tried to rescue him and invited him to teach at the Higher Normal School.
    1923　Age 45. Because Sichuan was blockaded, the news was isolated. He did not know that the Communist Party of China had been established. He and Yang Angong and others organized the "Chinese Youth Communist Party" in Chengdu, ran "Red Heart Review," and organized labor unions and peasant associations. The Dian-Gui army defeated Chen Jiongming, Mr. Sun Yat-sen returned to Guangdong to organize the General Headquarters, and Guangzhou became a revolutionary base. On January 1, the Kuomintang declaration was published, planning for reorganization. The Communist Party of China held its Third National Congress and resolved to cooperate with the Kuomintang to form a revolutionary united front.
    1924　Age 46. In January, he was forced to resign as principal of the Higher Normal School. He continued to engage in revolutionary activities in Chengdu. The May Day Labor Day conference was suppressed by the garrison and nearly arrested. He left Sichuan with Comrade Liu Bocheng, passing through Guizhou, Hunan, Shanghai and went to Beijing. In January, after the Kuomintang and the Communist Party cooperated in the reorganization, the First National Congress was held in Guangzhou. The declaration was published, with imperialism and feudal warlords as the targets of struggle. Mr. Sun Yat-sen reinterpreted the Three Principles of the People and determined the Three Great Policies, which was the beginning of the New Three Principles of the People. The Kuomintang-Communist cooperation led to the rapid development of the revolutionary movement, resulting in the victory of the Northern Expedition.
    1925　Age 47. In February, he arrived in Beijing and met with Comrade Zhao Shiyan. Knowing that the Communist Party of China had been established, he resolutely disbanded the Chinese Youth Communist Party and joined the Communist Party of China. In March, Mr. Sun Yat-sen passed away in Beijing, and a grand memorial service was held. It set off a revolutionary wave. In May, the May 30th Movement occurred, and the Great Revolution began. In August, he returned to Sichuan to run the Kuomintang. Based on the representatives of the Sichuan Provincial Autonomy Federation in the past, he established the Sichuan Provincial Kuomintang organization. He also ran the Sino-French School in Chongqing. The National Government was established in Guangzhou, Guangdong was unified, and the Kuomintang rightists' anti-communist activities became increasingly active. In August, they assassinated the left-wing leader Liao Zhongkai in an attempt to destroy the united front. In November, he served as a representative of the Kuomintang in Sichuan Province. He went to Guangzhou to attend the Second National Congress of the Kuomintang, served as the secretary-general of the congress, and actively prepared for the congress.
    1926　Age 48. In January, the Second National Congress of the Kuomintang was held, and he was elected as a member of the Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang. The congress decided to continue to implement the Three Great Policies and strike at the right-wing separatists. In March, the Zhongshan Warship Incident occurred, and the right-wing's anti-communist activities became more intense. He returned to Sichuan from Guangdong and persuaded the Qian Army Yang Qichang, Wang Tianpei and other departments to revolt and were compiled into the Ninth and Tenth Armies of the National Revolutionary Army. In May, the Kuomintang Central Committee plenary session, under the control of the right-wing, passed the "Party Affairs Reorganization Act," implemented party dictatorship, and conspired against communism. In July, he returned to Guangzhou and held a joint meeting of the Kuomintang executive and supervisory committees with He Xiangning, Gu Mengyu and others. The meeting passed resolutions such as reducing rent by two-fifths and implementing intra-party democracy. In July, he launched the Northern Expedition and occupied Wuhan in October. It was decided to move the National Government to Wuhan and arrive there on New Year's Day next year. In December, a joint meeting of the Kuomintang Central Committee and government members was established in Wuhan. He participated in the capacity of a member of the Kuomintang Central Committee and presided over military and political affairs. On December 13, the Revolutionary Army recovered Yichang, and the situation was chaotic. He was sent to Yichang to handle it.
    1927　Age 49. The Kuomintang rightists were in Nanchang at that time, taking Wuhan as the center of the workers' and peasants' movement, refusing to move the capital, which evolved into the opposition between Nanchang and Wuhan. The Wuhan government then formed a five-member action committee, and he was appointed as one of the five members, resolutely struggling against the reactionaries. It was decided to convene the Third Plenary Session of the Second Kuomintang Central Committee. Under the resolute opposition to compromise of Comrade Wu Yuzhang, the meeting was finally held on March 7th, and democratic resolutions such as raising party power were made. He was elected as the secretary of the Central Party Department of the Kuomintang. The Shanghai Three Uprisings were victorious. Nanjing was recovered. On March 31, the Chongqing Massacre occurred. Yang Angong, Qi Shuqi, Chen Dasan and dozens of students were killed. The April 12th coup occurred. The Kuomintang purged the party, massacred communists and revolutionaries. In May, the Ma Ri Incident occurred in Changsha. Since Wang Jingwei returned to office in Wuhan in mid-April, the upper-level members represented by him conspired to compromise. On the night of July 14th, a secret anti-communist meeting was held, and the next day he went to Jiujiang with Xu Teli, Lin Zuhan, Liu Bocheng and others to organize the Kuomintang Central Office. On August 1st, he participated in the Nanchang Uprising, served as a member and secretary-general of the Revolutionary Committee, fought in Jiangxi, Guangdong, Fujian and until the failure of Chao-Shan. Then he went abroad to the Soviet Union via Hong Kong and Shanghai. The Guangzhou Uprising failed in December, and the Great Revolution came to an end. China once again fell into division, civil war and imperialist oppression.
    1928　Age 50. First, he recuperated in the Kremlin seaside in the Soviet Union. In August, he entered the Institute of Chinese Studies to study land and peasant issues.

Since the September 18th Incident, Japanese imperialism has made progress, occupying our Rehe and eastern Chahar, coveting North China, and the national crisis is unprecedentedly serious. The CPC issued the August 1st Declaration, calling on the country to stop the civil war, concentrate its national strength, and unite to resist Japan. In October, he was sent to France to run the "National Salvation Times" to engage in anti-Japanese national united front propaganda, which played a huge role throughout the country, especially among overseas Chinese. The December 9th Movement occurred, and the national salvation movement was widely launched.
    1936　Age 58. He returned to Moscow and served as a teacher in the Chinese Department of Oriental University. He wrote "Chinese History Tutorial" as teaching material. The Xi'an December 12th Incident occurred. The CPC insisted on a peaceful resolution, and the civil war ended as a result.
