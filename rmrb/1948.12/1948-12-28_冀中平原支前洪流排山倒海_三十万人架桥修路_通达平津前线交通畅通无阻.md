[Jizhong News] He Zili reports: The battle cry of "Fight to Beiping, capture Fu Zuoyi alive!" has inspired the people of Jizhong to support the front lines, like a massive wave overwhelming mountains and seas, rushing into the battle to liberate Tianjin and Beiping. In just over twenty days, the people of Jizhong repaired over 200 *li* of roadbeds on the Pinghan and Jinpu Railways, and repaired over 3,250 *li* of highways crisscrossing Jizhong, as well as over 40 bridges on various rivers, making transportation to the front lines even smoother. According to incomplete statistics, over 300,000 civilian laborers participated in this glorious task.

　　When rushing to repair the roadbeds of the Pinghan (from north of Dingxian to south of Xinle, 120 *li*) and Jinpu (from Cangzhou to Botou, 80 *li*) Railways, they achieved "level tops and smooth slopes, layer upon layer of rammed earth" in two days. When rushing to repair the Pinghan Line, teams and platoons spontaneously launched challenges and competitions to strive for merit, and everywhere there were shouts of "Hurry up and build the railway tracks, drive away the enemy!" In order to strive for merit, the civilian laborers of Xiniu Village in the ninth district of Xinle did not rest even when other villagers rested. When rushing to repair the Jinpu Line, people seemed to forget that it was winter; Dong Laosan of Dongguan Village in Cangxian was working shirtless. In the competition, Wang Guantun District of Cangxian completed five days of work in one and a half days (started work on the 26th and handed over the work at noon on the 27th). Fifteen civilian laborers from Yangjiaqiao completed five days of work in one day. During the rush repair, without rammers, they took the stones from the station and used them as rammers, and rushed to nearby villages to drive out sulfur axles to roll the roadbed, which turned out to be more magnetic and better than wooden rammers. The cadres leading the rush repair of the roadbed were responsible and careful. Comrade Han Xihui, assistant of Fenghua Dian District in Cangxian, used a "level" to measure whether the dimensions were sufficient and whether it was level when he finished work. This 200-*li* long roadbed was completed by more than 43,000 civilian laborers in six days.

　　The bridge-repairing civilian laborers, unafraid of the cold river water and the pricking of thin ice, always worked hard to rush the repairs. Zhanggezhuang in the newly liberated seventh district of Baxian, eight elementary school students automatically participated in the bridge repair, each assigned a day's work, completed it faster than others, and also helped others. Seven or eight civilian laborers from Fengcun worked shirtless, stepping in the muddy water for half a day without rest. With the active rush repairs by the masses, 23 larger bridges were completed. Among them, 16 were newly built and 7 were renovated, with 19 capable of carrying heavy trucks, 1 pontoon bridge, and 3 temporary bridges. However, for the convenience of the troops' advance and transportation, the counties also erected many small bridges on the rivers in their counties: Huanghua alone erected 15 small bridges on the Jian River, and Gaocheng also completed three small bridges on the Cangshi Road. In Qingcangjiao and Gaoyang, some small bridges collapsed and the water was not deep, blocking two small rivers. In total, more than 40 large and small bridges were built, making transportation in Jizhong unimpeded. Of the 3,000 *li* of highways repaired, the Eighth Sub-district alone completed 1,372 *li* of 11 highways, including Cangding, Jinbao, Pingda, Jincang, Cangyan, and Canghuang, before December 6, using 235,912 civilian laborers. Other sub-districts also completed construction by December 7.

　　冀中平原支前洪流排山倒海
  　三十万人架桥修路
    通达平津前线交通畅通无阻
    【冀中讯】何子立报导：“打到北平去，活捉傅作义”的战斗号召，鼓舞着冀中人民支前的行列，象排山倒海的巨浪，奔向解放平津的战斗洪流里。冀中各地人民仅二十余天就修复了平汉、津浦两大铁路路基二百余里，修好交叉冀中各地的三千二百五十余里的公路线，及各个河流上的桥梁四十余座，使通达前线的交通更加畅通。计参加这一光荣任务的民工，据不完全的统计就有三十余万人。
    抢修平汉（定县以北到新乐以南一二○里）、津浦（沧州到泊头八○里）两大铁路路基时，两天作到了“顶平坡顺，层土层夯”。在抢修平汉线时，班与班排与排自动掀起挑战竞赛争取立功的热潮，到处有“赶快修上火车道，把敌人赶跑”的喊声。新乐九区西牛村为了争取立功，别村民工休息他们也不休息。在抢修津浦线时，人们似乎忘记了是冬天；沧县东关村的董老三，就光着膀子干。沧县王官屯区在竞赛中五天的活一天半就完成了（二十六日开工，二十七号午时即交工）。杨家桥的十五个民工，五天的活一天就完成了。他们在抢修中，没有夯，就把车站上的石头拿起来当夯使，到附近村里赶出硫轴来轧，结果比木夯还磁实还好。领导抢修路基的干部，负责而仔细、沧县风化店区的助手韩西会同志，收工时用“水平尺”量，看够不够尺寸，平不平。这长达二百里的路基，四万三千多个民工，六天全部完成。
    修桥民工，不怕河水的寒冷和薄冰的刺伤，始终努力抢修。新解放的霸县七区张各庄，八个高小学生自动的参加了修桥，每人分了一工活，比别人完成的快，还帮助别人干。冯村七八个民工光着膀子踏着泥水，干了半天也不休息。在群众积极的赶修下，二十三座较大的桥梁完成了。其中有十六座是新建立的，七座是重新修理的，能通过载重汽车的十九座，浮桥一座，便桥三座。但各县为了部队前进和运输方便，又在本县河流上架设了很多小桥：仅黄骅在硷河上就架了十五座小桥，藁城在沧石路上也完成了三个小桥，青沧交、高阳有的小桥坍塌，水又不大，堵死了两个小河。总计共大小桥四十多座，使我冀中各地运输畅通无阻。修筑公路三千里，仅八分区在十二月六号前，就全部完成了沧定、津保、平大、津沧、沧盐、沧黄等十一条公路一千三百七十二里，动用民工二十三万五千九百一十二个，其他分区也在十二月七号竣工。
