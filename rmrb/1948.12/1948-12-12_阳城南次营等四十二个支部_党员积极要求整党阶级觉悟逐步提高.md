    Yangcheng Nanciying and Forty-two Other Branches
    Party Members Actively Demand Party Rectification, Class Consciousness Gradually Increases
    [This Newspaper] The preliminary party rectification in Nanciying and forty-two other branches in Yangcheng, Taiyue, is progressing smoothly. Around the 8th, each branch successively launched branch work inspections and intra-party criticism and self-criticism. Of the eight hundred and seventy-six party members, all participated except for a few who were unable to due to illness. After the inspection began, some comrades expressed regret and remorse for their past wrongdoings that infringed upon the interests of the people, some even shedding tears of sadness. For example, the deputy secretary of Nanciying branch, who had participated in party rectification before, still retained some of his mistakes and did not thoroughly examine them. He said, "I didn't check the collective corruption in the past, and I've been carrying this burden for more than a year. Now I want to put it down." He also prepared to report at the branch general meeting and solicit everyone's criticism of himself. In addition, some "nice guy" comrades have also changed. For example, Liangcheng party member Fa Jin said, "I used to know about the mistakes of my comrades but didn't say anything, I was a nice guy; now I know this is wrong, only by washing away all the mistakes can I be fearless!" Some individual branches initially had the problem of "not knowing where to start." Under the specific leadership and timely assistance of the working comrades, they transformed within two or three days. According to Comrade Li Mintang, the county secretary, the reason why this work has unfolded relatively smoothly is mainly due to the following two reasons:
    (1) When conveying the Party Committee's policy on party rectification, each district and branch paid attention to reviewing the specific facts of the close relationship between the Party and the masses in their own region and village, and conducted a review-style communication. Each district convened a three- to four-day party member meeting by district to communicate one section and discuss one section. After returning to the village, they further combined it with the situation in their own village for discussion, and carried out fragmentary reflections along with the discussion, so that everyone initially understood the purpose, policy, and significance of party rectification, and inspired everyone's consciousness. For example, Liangcheng party member Xu Chunxi said: "The wrong things mentioned in the communication are all present in our village, the Party must rectify, or it will perish!" Many comrades, after hearing the communication, requested: "Check me first." Thus, a favorable condition was laid for carrying out criticism and self-criticism.
    (2) In view of the unsound general branch life in the past and everyone's level of understanding, the education of basic party knowledge was continuously carried out to gradually improve everyone's ability to distinguish right from wrong and overcome liberal tendencies. For example, the Nanciying branch could not carry out criticism in the first two days. Some said, "It's so chaotic, there's no way to start!" Some simply said, "Our understanding of the Party is poor." Others were afraid of offending people and shirked their responsibility, saying: "I can't remember who got what from the fruits of struggle!" Based on these situations, the leadership explained the basic knowledge of the Party to the party members and discussed it, and also explained some of the main contents of the eleven articles against liberalism. Everyone's eyes brightened, and they had something to say. Many problems have now been checked out, and things that the masses never knew have also been checked. Everyone is so enthusiastic that they don't even bother to eat.
    Based on the above developments and the reports from various districts, the county party committee recently put forward the following two suggestions to the sub-committees and grassroots work cadres, hoping that everyone will pay attention to them so that the movement can go deeper more normally: (1) Do not excessively adhere to the time limit and rush to complete the "task." The degree of problem resolution should determine the pace. It should be "well-founded" and only when there is truly nothing wrong, can it be considered "nothing wrong." At the same time, do not simply say: "This is wrong" or "This is my fault," but further guide everyone to understand the root, nature, and harm of the mistake to the interests of the Party and the masses, and initially formulate methods for correction. At the same time, a comprehensive analysis should be carried out. Achievements are achievements, and mistakes are mistakes. There must be a scientific and realistic attitude. (2) The inspection should focus on checking the main problems of branches and party members infringing on the interests of the people, according to the different situations of each branch.

    阳城南次营等四十二个支部
    党员积极要求整党阶级觉悟逐步提高
    【本报讯】太岳阳城南次营等四十二个支部，初步整党正在顺利进行中。在八号左右、各支部已先后展开了支部工作检查及党内的批评与自我批评。八百七十六个党员，除少数因病不能参加以外，全部都参加了。检查开始后，有的同志对自己过去侵犯人民利益的错误行为，表示后悔、痛心，有的甚至伤心落泪。象南次营副支书，过去也曾参加过整党，可是对错误还保留着一部分，没全彻底检讨，他说：“我过去对集体贪污就没作检查，背着包袱一年多了，现在要把它放下。”并准备在支部大会上报告，征求大家对自己的批评。另外有些“老好人”的同志，也变了样。如梁城党员发金说：“我过去知道同志们的错误也不说，是个老好人；现在我知道这不对了，只有错误都洗净，才能啥也不怕！”有个别支部开始时，曾有“不知该从哪着手”的问题，在工作同志具体领导、及时帮助下，两三天内就转变了。据县书李敏唐同志谈，这一工作所以展开的比较顺利，主要有以下两个原因：
    （一）在传达区党委的整党方针时，各区、各支部都注意了根据本地区、本村党与群众关系不密切的具体事实，进行了检讨式的传达，各区都以区为单位，召开了三天到四天党员大会，传达一段，讨论一段。回村后，又进一步结合本村情况，进行讨论，随讨论随进行了片断的反省，使大家初步领会了整党的目的、方针和意义，启发了大家的自觉性。象梁城党员许春喜说：“传达中所说的错误东西，我村样样都有，党是非整不行，再不整就要灭亡！”好多同志听了传达，都要求：“先检查我。”这样，打下了开展批评与自我批评的有利条件。
    （二）针对过去一般支部生活不健全的情况和大家的认识程度，不断进行党的基本知识的教育，使大家逐渐提高分辨是非的能力，克服自由主义倾向。象南次营支部，头两天批评就展不开，有的说：“乱的很，没法下手！”有的只是笼统地说：“咱对党认识差。”还有的怕惹人，推脱说：“斗争果实，谁分了些啥，咱也记不得了！”领导上根据这些情况，就把党的基本知识给党员讲解，并讨论了一番，又把反对自由主义十一条中几个主要的内容讲解了一遍。大家眼睛亮了，也就有话可说了。现已检查出好多问题，把群众从来不知道的事情也作了检查，大家连饭也顾不上吃，情绪很好。
    根据以上发展的情形，和各区的汇报，县委最近又给各分委会各基点工作干部，提出以下两点意见，希大家注意，以便运动能更正常的深入下去：（一）不要过分拘守时间的限制，急于完成“任务”，应以问题解决的程度来决定，要“有根有据”，真正没有啥时，才可认为“没有啥”。同时，不要单说：“这是错误的”或“这是我不对”，还要进一步领导大家，认识错误的根源、性质和对党对群众利益的损害，初步订出改正的办法。同时要全面地分析，成绩就是成绩，错误就是错误，要有科学的、实事求是的态度。（二）检查应根据各支部不同的情况，把重点放在检查支部、党员侵犯人民利益的主要问题上面去。（克勋）
