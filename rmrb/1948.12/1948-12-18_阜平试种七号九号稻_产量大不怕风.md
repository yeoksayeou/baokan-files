　　Fuping Trials No. 7 and No. 9 Rice
    High Yield and Wind-Resistant
    [North Yue News] Fuping County has successfully trialed "No. 7" and "No. 9" rice varieties. In Baihe and Caochangkou, the county specifically selected good beach land for the trial of these two rice varieties this year, using simultaneous planting, simultaneous silt application, and the same cultivation methods for comparison. The trial results showed that the yield of "No. 7" and "No. 9" rice varieties was better than that of local rice. Its characteristics are: First, the panicles of "No. 7" and "No. 9" rice are about the same size as local rice, but the grains are denser. Second, the rice straw is very hard, the grains are long and firm, resistant to wind abrasion, not afraid of thick silt, and have strong insect resistance. Third, the yield per mu is about 300 jin, while local rice only yields 220 jin per mu; one dou of rice can produce five sheng of milled rice, while local rice only produces four sheng; and it tastes better. The experience of trialing "No. 7" and "No. 9" rice: First, the sowing period should be during the Start of Summer solar term, not too late. Second, it is suitable for planting in flood-prone land; the earlier and more silt is applied, the better; it is not suitable for planting rice in clear water land. Third, sowing should be denser than local rice, preferably 17 to 18 jin per mu. Fourth, after emergence, avoid drought and water and weed early. (Guang Ming, Geng Zhengzeng, Liu Shilin)

　　阜平试种七号九号稻
    产量大不怕风
    【北岳讯】阜平试种“七号”“九号”稻种成功。该县白河、草厂口为试种该两稻种，今年特选择了好滩地，用同时种、同时放淤、同样的耕作进行对比。经试种对比结果，“七号”、“九号”稻种产量比本地稻子好。其特点：一、“七号、九号”稻穗和本地稻穗大小差不多，但比本地稻粒稠。二、稻秸很硬，粒长的结实，不怕风磨，不怕淤泥厚，抗虫害力强。三、每亩产量约三百斤，而本地稻每亩只产二百二十斤；出米每斗能出五升，本来稻只出四升；而且好吃。试种“七号、九号”稻的经验：一、播种期要在立夏节，不宜太迟。二、适合洪水地种植，上泥越早越多越好，不宜清水地种稻。三、播种要比本地稻子稠些，每亩以十七、八斤为宜。四、出苗后不要受旱，要早些放水锄拔。（广明、耿振曾、刘世琳）
