The North China People's Government Convenes Meeting on Work for Honored Servicemen
　　Cultivating Honored Servicemen to Participate in New Democratic Construction
　　[This newspaper dispatch] In order to strengthen the work for honored servicemen (hereinafter referred to as Honored Servicemen) and implement the Regulations on Preferential Treatment and Compensation for Honored Servicemen, the North China People's Government convened a meeting on the work for Honored Servicemen on November 27th. Thirty-seven cadres, including the heads of civil affairs departments of various administrative offices, directors (bureaus) of honored servicemen management offices, honored servicemen schools, and some special districts and county-level civil affairs departments, attended the meeting. The meeting adopted a combination of reporting and discussion methods. After reporting on a problem, the problem was raised for discussion in groups and at the general meeting. After reaching a consensus, the meeting proceeded to the second problem. At the meeting, the work for Honored Servicemen in the North China region was unified. The meeting conducted research and discussion on the implementation of the "Regulations on Preferential Treatment and Compensation for Honored Servicemen," the "Measures for the Treatment of Elderly and Infirm Retired Servicemen," and the "Measures for the Treatment of Elderly and Infirm Retired Personnel" recently promulgated by the North China People's Government. The meeting discussed specific solutions to problems that might arise during implementation due to different regulations in different regions in the past.

　　Strengthen Political Education for Honored Servicemen
　　Cultivate Production and Employment Skills
　　Regarding the guiding principles, tasks, and implementation issues of the work for Honored Servicemen, experiences were exchanged based on the situations in various regions. Everyone agreed that political and ideological education for Honored Servicemen should be strengthened, and their production and employment skills should be cultivated. We should transform the possible meritorious service mentality and pessimistic and disappointed emotions that may arise after injury and disability, so that those who can participate in work can participate in work, and those who cannot participate in work can become model citizens after returning to their villages and play an active leading role in various tasks. For especially and first-class Honored Servicemen who cannot return home and cannot work or produce, Honored Servicemen schools should provide accommodation and education. In addition, we should strengthen the concept of honoring and respecting Honored Servicemen among cadres and the masses, and change the past incorrect understanding of Honored Servicemen. We should recognize that Honored Servicemen comrades have received long-term or relatively long-term education in the People's Army and have been tempered by organized and disciplined life, and have undergone the test of bloody struggle. The vast majority of them are good, law-abiding, obedient to leadership, and actively participate in work and production. Although some problems have occurred among Honored Servicemen in the past, they are still individual and extremely small numbers. On the one hand, these comrades have burdened themselves with the baggage of "meritorious service" and "special status." On the other hand, our leadership has failed to provide good education and has not resolved their difficulties sufficiently. Some comrades condone their mistakes and do not provide criticism and education. Some even adopt an attitude of respect and avoidance, which further promotes the development of their erroneous thinking.

　　All Rear-Area Organs and Groups
　　Absorb Honored Servicemen to Participate in Work
　　The discussion on encouraging and cultivating Honored Servicemen to participate in work was relatively detailed. Article 8 of the Regulations on Preferential Treatment and Compensation for Honored Servicemen stipulates that "In order to encourage rear-area organs to absorb Honored Servicemen to participate in work, organs with Honored Servicemen participating in work shall be allowed to increase the number of personnel in the establishment as appropriate (two or more second-class disabled persons shall be counted as one person, and one third-class disabled person shall be counted as one person, or three persons shall be counted as two persons)." Honored Servicemen who participate in the work of enterprise departments shall, in principle, still receive compensation, and the enterprise organs may give appropriate salaries according to their ability. Retired Honored Servicemen who are re-employed as employees or primary school teachers in various public organs and shops shall still receive their compensation. All rear-area organs and local work departments should recognize that Honored Servicemen are a large force in building a new China and pay attention to absorbing them to participate in work, so as to open up avenues for Honored Servicemen to participate in work. The ways in which Honored Servicemen participate in work are: on the one hand, Honored Servicemen who come down from the army are trained and cultivated through Honored Servicemen schools. When necessary, they can form work groups to participate in local work, conduct learning internships, and then be assigned work. In the first half of this year, after training, the Honored Servicemen who were assigned to various rear-area jobs by the Jizhong Honored Servicemen School numbered 128. Regarding the issue of Honored Servicemen schools, Vice Chairman Lan Gongwu emphasized: Honored Servicemen schools should set up cultural classes, set up special cultural teachers, and establish a formal learning system. We must lay this foundation in order to further improve their employment skills. On the other hand, we should absorb Honored Servicemen who have retired and are in the countryside to participate in village work, gradually cultivate them in work, and promote them level by level. Small training courses held locally can also absorb them according to the conditions of their physical fitness, cultural level, and working ability, and cultivate their working ability, so as to absorb them to participate in work.

　　Regarding the issue of Honored Servicemen management institutions at all levels, after discussion, it was finally agreed to set up a Honored Servicemen Management Bureau under the Civil Affairs Department of the Administrative Office to specifically manage the work of Honored Servicemen. At the special district and county levels, a section or staff member should be set up under the Civil Affairs Section to specifically manage the work of Honored Servicemen. Regarding the issue of Honored Servicemen groups, after discussion, it was believed that Honored Servicemen in the past were separated from production, and their production capacity, living habits, and connection with the masses were not as good as ordinary peasants. They also need help from the masses when they are disabled. At the same time, they have higher political awareness and stronger organizational discipline and other advantages. Therefore, they need to go to the masses to participate in various organizations of the masses, and should not be organized separately. Although Jizhong has successful experience in the past, Jinnan, Jiluyu, and other places have had failed lessons. Therefore, political organizations of Honored Servicemen should not be established universally, and those that have been established in the past should gradually be transformed into production organizations that have close ties with the masses. In addition, discussions were held on the budget for Honored Servicemen schools and the work funds for Honored Servicemen next year.

　　Finally, Lei Renmin, Deputy Minister of Civil Affairs of the North China People's Government, made a summary, first clarifying the spirit of the Regulations on Preferential Treatment and Compensation for Honored Servicemen. The grade of disability for Honored Servicemen is determined by the principle of loss of production capacity as the main factor and loss of living capacity as the auxiliary factor. The amount of compensation is determined based on: on the one hand, solving the living difficulties of Honored Servicemen, and on the other hand, taking care of the difficulties in financial expenditure in wartime. At the same time, it is also determined based on the conditions of the general Honored Servicemen who have been allocated land after land reform and the living standards of the general middle peasants. Although there are regulations on compensation, the main policy for solving the difficulties of Honored Servicemen is still to adopt the method of production. Otherwise, relying solely on compensation will not be able to achieve a well-fed and well-clothed life even if it can solve the living difficulties. Secondly, Deputy Minister Lei explained the issues that everyone debated, such as the Honored Servicemen institutions and Honored Servicemen groups.

　　The meeting concluded on the afternoon of December 9th after Vice Chairman Lan Gongwu delivered a closing speech.

　　华北人民政府召开荣军工作会议
  　培养荣誉军人参加新民主主义建设
    【本报讯】为加强荣誉军人（下简称荣军）工作，贯彻执行荣誉军人优待抚恤条例，华北人民政府于十一月二十七日召开荣军工作会议。到会各行政公署民政处长、荣管处（局）长、荣校及一部专区与县级民政部门之干部三十七人，会议采取报告与讨论相结合的方式，报告一个问题后，即提出问题经小组与大会讨论，意见一致后再进入第二个问题。在会上统一了华北区的荣军工作，对华北人民政府新颁布的“荣誉军人优待抚恤条例”、“年老病弱退伍军人待遇办法”及“年老病弱退职人员待遇办法”等三个条例的执行问题，进行了研究讨论，对执行中因过去各地区条例不同而可能发生的问题，讨论出了具体解决的办法。
    加强荣军政治教育
  　培养生产就业技能
    关于荣军工作的方针任务及执行问题，根据各地情况交流了经验，大家一致认为应加强对荣军的政治思想教育，培养其生产就业技能，转变其负伤残废后可能发生的功臣思想与悲观失望情绪，使能参加工作者参加工作，不能参加工作者回村后能成为模范公民，在各种工作中起积极带头作用。对不能回家又不能工作与生产之特等、一等荣军，荣校应予以收容教养；另外应加强干部群众的优荣尊荣观点，转变过去对荣军的不正确认识，应认识荣军同志在人民军队中受过长期的或较长期的教育与有组织有纪律的生活的锻炼，经过流血斗争的考验，他们中绝大多数是好的，是奉公守法、服从领导、积极参加工作参加生产的，过去在荣军中虽然发生过一些问题，但仍然是个别的极少数的分子，这一方面是由于这些同志在思想上背上了“功臣”、“特殊”的包袱，另方面在于我们领导上未能很好的予以教育，对他们的困难解决不够，有的同志则迁就他们的错误，不给予批评教育，有的甚至采取敬而远之的态度，这样就更加助长了他们错误思想的发展。
    各后方机关团体
  　吸收荣军参加工作
    关于鼓励与培养荣军参加工作问题，讨论较为详尽，在荣誉军人优待抚恤条例第八条内曾规定“为鼓励后方机关吸收荣军参加工作，对有荣军参加工作之机关，准予在编制上酌增人数（二等以上残废者二人以一人计算，三等残废者一人以一人或三人以二人计算）。”凡荣军参加企业部门工作者，原则上仍发抚恤费，企业机关可就其能力给以适当薪金；已退伍荣军重任各公立机关商店之雇员或小学教员者，其抚恤费仍照发，各后方机关地方工作部门应认识荣军是建设新中国的一大批力量，注意吸收他们参加工作，这样以打开荣军参加工作之门路。荣军参加工作之方式，一方面是由部队下来之荣军经过荣校予以培养训练，必要时可组成工作组参加地方工作，进行学习实习，而后分配工作，冀中荣校今年上半年训练后，分配后方各种工作的荣军即有一百二十八人。关于荣校问题，蓝公武副主席强调指出：荣校设文化班，专设文化教员，建立正规的学习制度，一定要打下这个基础，才能进一步提高其就业技能。另一方面吸收已退伍在乡之荣军参加村中工作，在工作中逐渐培养，逐级提拔，地方上举办之小型训练班亦可根据在乡荣军之身体、文化程度及工作能力等条件吸收他们参加，培养其工作能力，以便吸收他们参加工作。
    关于各级荣管机构问题，经讨论后，最后同意在行署民政处下设荣管局，专管荣军工作，专区、县在民政科下设股或科员专管荣军工作。关于荣军小组问题，经过讨论后认为荣军过去脱离生产，其生产能力，生活习惯以及与群众联系上都不如一般农民群众，他们有了残废也需要群众帮助，同时他们有较高的政治觉悟与较强的组织性纪律性等优点，因之他们需要到群众中去参加群众的各种组织，而不应单独组织。过去冀中虽有成功的经验，但冀南、冀鲁豫等地却有失败的教训，所以不应普遍设立荣军政治性组织，过去已建立的应逐渐转变为与群众有密切联系的生产组织。此外对荣校与明年荣军工作经费的预算等都进行了讨论。
    最后由华北人民政府民政部雷任民副部长作总结，首先对荣誉军人优待抚恤条例的精神加以阐明，荣军残废等级是以生产能力丧失为主，生活能力丧失为辅的方针而规定的，抚恤费数目的规定是根据：一方面解决荣军生活困难，另方面照顾战争情况下财政开支的困难；同时并根据土改后一般荣军已分得土地与一般中农的生活水准等条件而规定的。虽然有抚恤费的规定，但解决荣军困难的方针主要的还是采取生产的办法，不然单靠抚恤金即使能解决生活困难也不可能达到丰衣足食。其次雷副部长就大家争论的荣军机构及荣军小组等问题作了解释。
    会议于十二月九日下午蓝公武副主席致闭幕词后结束。
