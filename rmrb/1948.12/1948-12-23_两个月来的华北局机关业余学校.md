　　The Spare-Time School of the North China Bureau for the Past Two Months

　　　　(I) The Situation in the Past Two Months

　　The spare-time school of the North China Bureau has been running for two full months since its opening on October 14th. The number of students has gradually increased, and a branch school has been added. The number of people has increased from 82 to more than 220, an increase of more than two and a half times. The enthusiasm for learning has been rising with the development of the situation. Chinese language, arithmetic, and social development history classes are held on time every week without interruption. Although the weather is cold during class, the students can overcome the cold and insist on taking notes. Some comrades take textbooks with them when they go out on official business, take time to review; after returning to explain official duties, the first thing is to make up lessons. A comrade from the small kitchen, while boiling water, practiced arithmetic problems. The students listened attentively in class, and if they didn't understand something, they would ask, not letting go of a single word or punctuation mark easily. After class, most of them can squeeze out all available time to review. During public rest time, people can be seen everywhere doing calculations, writing essays, keeping diaries, practicing calligraphy, and dictating new words. Often, they forgo games in order to review. There are many similar situations. Although there are a few people who don't care, learning is okay, not learning is also okay, but most comrades are conscientious and afraid of falling behind.
　　The advanced arithmetic class started with factors and multiples, and has finished learning about whole fractions; the Chinese language class has covered six lessons, learned some grammar and punctuation, and written two essays. The elementary arithmetic class started with the first chapter and has finished learning the four operations of integers and decimals; the Chinese language class has covered seven lessons, and taught punctuation and simple grammar, and written three essays. The social development history class has been held five times, covering the slave society. At the end of November, a test was held to adjust the classes. The school is now divided into advanced Chinese class (equivalent to the second half of middle school), intermediate Chinese class (equivalent to upper elementary school graduation level), elementary Chinese class (equivalent to lower elementary school graduation level), and literacy class. Advanced arithmetic class (equivalent to middle school level), intermediate arithmetic class (equivalent to upper elementary school graduation level), elementary arithmetic class (equivalent to lower elementary school graduation level), the social development history class remains in the original class. There are seven classes in total.
　　The learning of several groups in the Communications and Distribution Section is the best. After class and during public rest time, they can help each other to learn, even collectively dictate new words and correct each other. Generally, they are progressing very quickly. Comrade Yang Zhengxing, who knew very few characters, recognized 194 new characters in two months, knew how to read and explain these characters, and more than half of them could be dictated; he had never learned arithmetic before, but now he has learned multiplication, and can also calculate simple division. Comrade Zhao Gengxin, although he is over forty years old, did not know many characters in the past. After two months of study, he can roughly read the "Dazhong Daily". Other comrades also feel that their reading ability has been improved, the number of different characters has been greatly reduced, and they have learned how to explain and use many new words and sentences. It is a common phenomenon for comrades participating in the literacy class to recognize more than 130 characters.

　　　　(II) A Few Scattered Experiences:

　　1. At the beginning of the school year, the leadership repeatedly explained the importance of cultural learning. They made the students feel that they must work hard to learn and improve their culture in order to learn theory and technology, thereby improving their work ability and adapting to the needs of the development of the revolutionary situation. Therefore, the students' learning is conscious and not forced at all. At the beginning of the preparation, a principal was appointed to be responsible for all school affairs, and then the principal, the secretary of the general branch, and the teachers of each subject jointly formed a school affairs committee to be responsible for leadership. Under the administrative leadership and the guarantee of the branch, the school's policies, plans and various specific issues (such as equipment, school supplies, textbooks, learning paper and pens, etc.) have been successfully resolved. This is a decisive link in the school's ability to persist and develop.
　　2. Students must have appropriate organization. As soon as the school was established, learning groups were established according to the proximity of the students in each class to their residences, and a group leader was selected to lead the whole group in reviewing and previewing after class, and to discuss and reflect the students' requirements for learning and the teachers' opinions on teaching methods at any time, which played a certain role. Experience proves that: the Communications and Distribution Section has a sound learning group, so the learning is better and the results are greater. Departments with unsound learning groups are learning poorly and are a little slack.
　　3. There must be certain systems and discipline to ensure the completion of the learning plan and avoid laxity and randomness. Some systems and disciplines were stipulated when the school was established. After two months of trial operation, the following provisions are necessary: (1) Implement a roll call system, no absenteeism or late arrivals and early departures are allowed. If you cannot attend class due to something, you must ask the teacher for leave. (2) Assignments (arithmetic problems, essays) must be submitted on time, and the teacher's questions must be answered. (3) Implement an examination system. Tests will be conducted when learning reaches a certain stage, and those who fail will be held back. (4) Stipulate that academic performance is one of the assessments. Due to the above simple and necessary systems and disciplines, learning has been able to proceed on time for two months without interruption or slackness.
　　4. On teaching methods: Since the students are all on-the-job cadres, the class time is only five times a week (more than one hour each time). Therefore, the method of focusing on lectures in class and previewing and reviewing after class is adopted, and all exercises, essays and other assignments are done after class. After two months of experimentation, the students felt quite satisfied, because the teacher's lectures in the classroom gave them a lot of new knowledge and also inspired them, which was more effective. The lecturers must also prepare adequately before class, and give materials that are relevant, needed, and can be accepted and digested according to the students' level.

　　　　(III) Problems Currently Existing:

　　1. Uneven level. At the beginning, Chinese language and arithmetic were divided into two classes each. During teaching, it was felt that the level of each class was uneven. After lecturing, some complained that they could not keep up, some complained that it was too slow, some complained that there was too little explanation, and some complained that it was too tedious and meaningless. Later, Chinese language was divided into four classes and arithmetic was divided into three classes, but it was still uneven. The school's solution to this is to base on the majority of intermediate levels and take care of both ends (higher and lower levels). For example, when explaining Chinese language, it is necessary to explain new words, phrases, grammatical structure, and various knowledge, so that all listeners can gain something. Therefore, the progress is slower, and each lesson needs to be taught two to three times before it can be finished.
　　2. High mobility. Students have certain work posts, most of them are administrative, supply, and transportation personnel, and they often go out to work. Many people miss classes due to official business. After this group comes back, that group leaves again, and making up lessons is a big problem. The solution in the past two months has been that when they come back, they first make up lessons with the learning group leader, and if they cannot solve it, they ask the teacher. When there are too many people, the teacher gives supplementary lectures.
　　3. Many learning requirements, little learning time. The students' cultural level is low not in one subject, but in Chinese language, arithmetic, history, geography, and natural common sense. There are too many things to learn, but they are also very busy with work, so they cannot have classes every day, and the class time cannot be long. This requires selecting the main basic courses to learn, and cannot have everything. In order to supplement this situation, when teaching Chinese language, the textbooks selected must be articles that are related to various knowledge.

　　The above three problems are the most basic problems of the spare-time school of the agency. How to solve them well still needs further study.

　　两个月来的华北局机关业余学校
            （一）两个月的情况
    华北局机关业余学校，从十月十四日开学以来，到今天已整整两月。学生逐渐增多，并增设分校一处。人数从八十二人增到二百二十余人，增加两倍半多。学习情绪随着形势的发展，日益高涨，每周国文、算术、社会发展史均按时上课，未曾间断。上课时虽天气寒冷，学员均能战胜严寒，坚持记笔记。有些同志因公外出，还带着课本，抽暇复习；回来交待公务后，第一件事便是补课。小伙房一位同志，一面烧开水，一面演习算题。学员们上课听讲异常专心，稍有不懂，就提出来问，一个字一个标点符号都不肯轻易放过。课外又大多能挤出一切可利用的时间复习，一到公余时间，各处都可以看到有人在演算、作文、记日记、练习大小楷、默写生字，常常有为了复习而不去游戏的。类似这情形的事还很多。虽也有少数人满不在乎，学也行不学也可，但大多数同志均兢兢业业，唯恐落伍。
    高级班算术从约数倍数学起，已学完了整分数；国文讲了六课，学了一些文法和标点符号，作文两次。初级班算术从第一章学起，已学完了整数和小数四则；国文讲了七课，并讲了标点符号和简单的语法作法，作文三次。社会发展史上课五次，讲完了奴隶社会。十一月底为了调整班次，曾举行一次测验。现全校分为高级国文班（相当于中学后半期程度）、中级国文班（相当于高小毕业程度），初级国文班（相当于初小毕业程度）、识字班。高级算术班（相当于中学程度）、中级算术班（相当于高小毕业程度）、初级算术班（相当于初小毕业程度），社会发展史仍原班。共七个班。
    学习中以交发科几个小组为最好，课外公余，均能互助学习，甚至集体默写生字，互相纠正，一般进步都很快。识字很少的杨正兴同志，两个月认了一百九十四个生字，知道了这些字的念法讲法，并有一多半可以默写下来；过去没有学过算术，已学会了乘法，简单的除法也能算。赵更新同志年纪虽已四十有零，过去识字不多，经两月学习已能粗略的看大众报。其他同志也能感到阅读能力已有提高，差别字大大减少，学会了不少生字、词句的讲法用法。参加识字班的同志认够一百三十多字的是一般现象。
    　　　　（二）几点零星的经验：
    一、开学之初，领导上曾反复阐明文化学习之重要性。使学员感到，必须努力学习，提高文化，才能学习理论、技术，从而使工作能力提高，适应革命形势发展的需要，因而学员的学习是自觉的，毫无勉强的。开始筹备即指定了校长，负责学校一切事宜，接着又由校长总支负责同志及各科教员共同组成校务委员会负责领导，在行政领导与支部保证下，使学校方针计划及各种具体问题（如设备、校具、课本、学习纸笔等）均得到顺利解决。这是学校能以坚持与发展的决定一环。
    二、学员必须有适当的组织。学校一成立，即按各班学员依住址相近者成立了学习小组，选出组长，领导全组在课外复习预习，并随时讨论与反映学员对学习的要求与教员讲授方法的意见，曾起了一定作用。经验证明：交发科因学习小组健全，学习就搞得较好，得到效果较大。学习小组不健全的部门，学习就差，也就有些松劲。
    三、必须有一定制度与纪律，才能保证学习计划完成，避免松懈散漫。学校成立即规定了一些制度与纪律，经过两月来的试办，规定如下几条是必要的：（一）实行点名制度，不得旷课或迟到早退，有事不能到课必须向教员请假。（二）必须按时交作业（算题、作文），及回答教员的发问。（三）实行考试制度，在学习到一段落时进行测验，不及格者留级。（四）规定学习成绩作为鉴定之一。由于有上述简单与必需之制度和纪律，因而两月来学习能够按时进行，毫无间断松懈。
    四、教学方法上：由于学员都是在职干部，上课时间每周只五次（每次一时多）。因此，采取了在课堂着重讲解、课外进行预习复习，一切习题作文等作业都放在课外进行。经过两月试验，学员感到颇为满意，因为课堂上教员的讲解使他们获得不少新的知识，同时也得到了启发，收效较快。教授的人尤须在课前充分准备，根据学员的程度给以切合需要而又能接受与消化的材料。
    　　　　（三）目前所存在的问题：
    一、程度不齐。开始国文、算术各分两班，教学中感到每班程度不齐，讲后有的嫌赶不上，有的嫌太慢，有的嫌讲解太少，有的还嫌絮繁无意思。后来国文分成四班，算术分为三班，依然是不齐。学校对此解决办法，是根据大多数中等程度为基础，照顾两头（程度较高较低的）的教法。如讲解国文时，既要讲生字、词句，又要讲文法结构与各种知识，使听课者都能有所收获。因此，进行较慢，每一课需二次到三次才能讲完。
    二、流动性大。学员都有一定工作岗位，大部是行政、供给、交通部门人员，常常出外工作。因公误课的很多，这一批回来，那一批又走了，补课是个大问题。两月来的解决办法，是回来先向学习组长补课，不能解决的问教员。人数过多时由教员给补讲。
    三、学习上的要求多，学习时间少。学员们文化程度低不是那一门，而是国文、算术、历史、地理、自然各种常识都缺，需要学习的东西太多，但工作又很忙，不能每天上课，上课时间亦不能多。这就要选择主要的基本的课程来学，不能样样俱全，为了补助这种情况，在教国文时，选教材上须选些与各种知识联系的文章。
    以上三个问题，是机关业余学校最基本的问题，如何解决方好，还须继续研究。
