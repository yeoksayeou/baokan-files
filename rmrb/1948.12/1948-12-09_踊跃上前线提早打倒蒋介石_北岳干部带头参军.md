Comrade Du Erhu of the Industry and Commerce Office said: "I didn't go to the Northeast when I was transferred there in the past. I want to correct this mistake today." Hou Yong, the deputy secretary of the county party committee, proposed: "Wherever there are difficulties, I will go." Deputy County Head Zhang led 31 government employees to sign up. Many district cadres expressed to the Party: whether it is joining the army or going south, they will absolutely obey the Party's arrangements. In order to guarantee the completion of the task of joining the army, Hunyuan County launched challenge and competition movements in all districts of the county.
