　　Taiwan Price Hikes
　　[Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 18th] The Nanjing Nationalist bandit gang, seeing that its reactionary rule is on the verge of collapse, and completely losing confidence in the "Jiangnan Defense" boasted of by Chiang Kai-shek, is sweeping up wealth plundered from the people and fleeing to Taiwan and Hong Kong. The Nationalist Party's central organ, the Central Daily News, has established an office in Taiwan, preparing to replace the Nanjing Central Daily News. The China Times, the organ of the Political Warfare Bureau of the puppet Ministry of National Defense, is also planning to publish a Taiwan edition. The Nationalist Party's US Aid Utilization Committee has established an office in Taiwan. The puppet Central Bank has established a Taiwan Regional Bank. Chen Xing, the Deputy Governor of the head office of the bank, also arrived in Taiwan on the 8th. The "Zhongxing" ship, which arrived in Taipei and Keelung in late November, carried 2,000 Nationalist military and government officials and their families, with more than 10,000 pieces of luggage, and more than 100 cars parked at the dock. The large influx of Nationalist Party officials has caused prices and housing prices in Taiwan to skyrocket. "Prices in Taipei are twice as expensive as in Shanghai," and "unreliable Japanese-style office buildings now cost as much as $7,000 per building" (Associated Press). Puppet legislator Xi Yushu, puppet National Assembly representative Jin Zhenyu, former Nationalist Party 52nd Army Commander Zhao Gongwu, and former Nationalist Party Relief Administration Deputy Director Li Zhuomin, fled to Hong Kong on November 17th with a large amount of wealth. Customs officers there found five gold ingots on puppet National Assembly representative Jin Zhenyu.
