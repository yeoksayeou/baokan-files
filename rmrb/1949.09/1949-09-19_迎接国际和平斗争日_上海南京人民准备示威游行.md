　　Welcoming the International Day of Struggle for Peace
　　Shanghai and Nanjing People Prepare for Demonstrations and Parades

　　[Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 17th] The Liberation Daily published an editorial on the 15th entitled "Stop War, Defend Peace!" calling on all the people of East China and Shanghai, and all the people of China and the world, to actively prepare to participate in the large-scale demonstration on October 2nd, the International Day of Struggle for Peace. The editorial emphasized that the series of evil war-making activities carried out by the international imperialist aggressive bloc headed by US imperialism have created a huge threat to human security, and peace is in danger. However, the editorial firmly believes that the united and increasingly powerful world peace and democratic forces led by the Soviet Union will surely overcome the new war crisis. The editorial pointed out that this is not only because the broad masses of people in various countries have the desire and strength for peace, and not only because the core of this force—the powerful socialist country, the Soviet Union—has become increasingly strong, and the people's democratic countries are under the leadership of the Communist Parties of various countries armed with Marxism-Leninism, but also because war instigators are isolated and outwardly strong but inwardly weak. Therefore, the forces that love peace outweigh the forces that provoke war. As long as the people of the world are fully vigilant and united, they will surely be able to crush the new war conspiracies of imperialism.

　　[Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 18th] In response to the call of the World Peace Congress and the Chinese branch, and to welcome the "International Day of Struggle for Peace," the Nanjing Military Control Commission's Cultural and Art Department held a meeting on the 16th, determining to hold a city-wide parade and street exhibitions on the "International Day of Struggle for Peace," and to widely promote internationalism, further strengthening confidence in overcoming difficulties and building a new Nanjing.

　　迎接国际和平斗争日
  　上海南京人民准备示威游行
    【新华社上海十七日电】解放日报十五日以“制止战争，保卫和平!”为题发表社论，号召全华东和全上海人民和全中国全世界人民一起，积极准备参加十月二日国际和平斗争日的大示威。社论强调指出：以美帝国主义为首的国际帝国主义侵略阵营所进行的一连串的罪恶的制造战争的活动，已造成了人类安全的巨大威胁，和平在危险中。但社论坚信以苏联为首的世界和平民主力量的团结一致与日益强大，一定可以克服新的战争危机。社论指出：这不仅因为各国广大人民有和平的愿望与力量，不仅因为这个力量的核心——强大的社会主义国家苏联已日益壮大，各个人民民主国家是在以马列主义武装着的各国共产党领导之下，而且因为战争挑拨者是孤立的，是外强中干的。因此，爱好和平的力量超过了战争挑拨者的力量，只要全世界人民充分警觉，团结一致，就一定可以粉碎帝国主义新的战争阴谋。
    【新华社南京十八日电】为响应世界拥护和平大会和中国分会的号召，迎接“国际和平斗争日”，南京市军管会文艺处特于十六日召开会议，确定于“国际和平斗争日”举行全市大游行，举办街头展览会等，并普遍宣传国际主义，进一步加强克服困难、建设新南京的信心。
