　　American Imperialism Supports Japanese Bandits
    Investment Continues to Increase
    [Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, 15th] TASS, London, 14th: The Daily Telegraph and Morning Post diplomatic correspondent reports: American capital investment in Japan is constantly increasing. It is said that the Ford Motor Company has invested more than 75 million pounds in the Japanese chemical and ceramics industries, and 100 million pounds in the electrical industry. Other companies, such as DuPont, Westinghouse, General Electric, International Telephone, and American Smelting and Refining Company, also have huge investments. It is believed that the latter holds more than half of the shares of Japanese chemical factories. The Daily Telegraph and Morning Post went on to report that Japan's production is increasing due to the support of American capital, and the newspaper is concerned that Japan is striving to invade most of the markets that traditionally belonged to Britain with competitive manufactured goods.
