　　"Looking at Jinan from All Directions"
　　Our Newspaper Correspondent in Jinan Chen Yongjin
　　At the intersection of the Jinpu and Jiaoji Railways on the south bank of the lower reaches of the Yellow River, a new people's city is growing vigorously. This is Jinan City, the capital of Shandong Province. This inland city with a population of 700,000 was liberated by our Chen and Su troops in October last year.

　　If we look at Jinan City after more than ten months of liberation from the scenic spots such as Daming Lake and Baotu Spring, which were described in The Travels of Lao Ts'an, it is indeed a bit deserted than it was then. But if we observe it from Chairman Mao's "four directions and eight sides policy" of "developing production, prospering the economy, benefiting both public and private interests, benefiting both labor and capital, helping each other in urban and rural areas, and conducting internal and external exchanges," it has shown a new attitude. It is moving from a consumer city to a production city. What first catches the eye on the main streets or in the alleys are the simple peasants from the countryside, who are tensely and happily shouting, pulling horse-drawn carts or pushing handcarts loaded with goods and passing by in a hurry. In Jianzi Lane in the city, farmers are exchanging a large number of agricultural tools and daily necessities such as sickles, pots, and scissors for brand-new Renminbi. In Pulimen, Yuxing Paint Factory is also crowded with many farmers; the manager of the store once told reporters: the monthly output of 100,000 jin is not enough to sell.

　　The walls of the Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce are covered with charts of various colors, one of which marks the oil from the four villages in the first half of the year: 1,061,700 jin of soybean oil, 2,080,000 jin of peanut oil, 815,900 of sesame oil, rapeseed oil, green oil... Most of these come from the vast rural areas of northern Henan, southern Hebei, and eastern Pingyuan Province. In the first half of this year, the Municipal Trading Company allocated a total of 20.09 million jin of wheat, more than 12 million jin of millet, and more than 8 million jin of miscellaneous grains, and purchased 550,000 jin of cotton and more than 600,000 jin of match raw materials, ensuring the supply of some industrial raw materials.

　　With the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas, the passenger and freight agency industry (i.e., freight yards) in Jinan has also developed rapidly. Before liberation, there were more than 280 companies, and now there are 631 (two lines are still missing from the statistics).

　　The recovery and development of public and private enterprises in Jinan City has steadily completed the task of "increasing production by one inch" as pointed out by Chairman Mao.

　　In the ten months after the liberation of Jinan, thanks to the active efforts of all employees, all 60 large and small state-owned factories have moved towards normal production, including the restoration of Zhijing Grey Factory, Jinan Alcohol Factory, Dehe Yong Dyeing Factory, People's Paper Factory, Tannery, Jinan Chemical Factory, Huaxing Paper Factory, Huangtai Alcohol Factory, Jinan Electric Saw Factory, and Brick and Tile Factory, etc., eleven larger state-owned enterprises that had been shut down for many days before liberation. The workers have improved their political awareness from practice and established a new attitude towards labor. Among the representatives of this Jinan Workers' Congress, 40 men and women representatives are labor heroes and models in various factories. The output of each factory has increased except for a few with special reasons. For example, Renfeng Yarn Factory produced 7,419 bolts of fine cloth per month before liberation, and now it has reached 8,328 bolts. Huaxing Paper Factory produced 9,173 pounds per month before liberation, and now it has increased to 84,719 pounds. The output of Military Industry No. 5 Factory has increased by an average of 3.5 times.

　　Under the principle of "developing private industrial and commercial enterprises that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood," private factories in Jinan City have also achieved full development. In the first half of this year, in addition to vigorously providing loans to support them, the government also helped them solve the difficulties of raw materials and sales. At present, except for Chengfeng, Chengji, and Fengnian factories, which have suffered heavy losses due to the war and cannot resume work for a while, other private factories have almost all resumed work, and some have expanded production. Chengtong Yarn Factory has added 6,000 spindles, 10 steel wire machines, 30 looms, and a boiler this year. The Baoqing and Huaqing factories, which produced 48,840 bags of flour per month before liberation, have now reached a level of 99,319 bags per month. The number of small machine manufacturing factories has increased from 98 before liberation to 116 at present. The number of paint factories has increased from 18 to 35.

　　Private factories have gone through some tortuous struggles from recovery to development. At the beginning of liberation, because the capitalists had imposed excessive oppression and exploitation on the workers in the past, the workers put forward the struggle to increase wages and oppose excessive exploitation. The government supported the workers' reasonable demands, but also persuaded and educated them on some of the excessively left-leaning conditions, and correctly resolved labor-capital disputes. Afterwards, although some capitalists still suspected whether they would "divide equally" and "struggle" in the future, after our vigorous publicity of the policy, especially the publication of Comrade Li Lisan's article "On Developing Production and Benefiting Both Labor and Capital" and Comrade Liu Shaoqi's speech to the industrial circles in Pingjin, their ideological concerns were basically eliminated, and they boldly carried out production.

　　Because we lack experience in industrial leadership, there are still shortcomings:

　　The first is blindness in production. For example, the blanket factory of the cotton weaving factory of the Clothing Bureau, which weaved military blankets before liberation. After we took over, the leadership did not carefully consider the raw materials and sales, so it recruited workers and used 20,000 old cotton woven blankets. However, due to the poor quality and high price, it was difficult to sell, so it had to stop work and accumulate capital.

　　The second is the failure to organize supply and sales relationships from many parties. A large amount of nitrate is produced in the third and fourth special districts of the Bohai Sea area. Since the army went south, military use has stopped, and there is no way out for the products, but at this time, the Jinan Paint Factory lacks 2 million jin of nitrate and cannot buy it anywhere, resulting in a situation of surplus and deficiency.

　　The Municipal Party Committee and the Trading Company have made profound reflections on the above-mentioned deviations and further realized the importance of the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas in today's economic construction. In order to carry out this work more effectively in the future, the "Production and Construction Promotion Committee" was officially formed on August 31 to promote the work more vigorously.

　　“四面八方”看济南
    本报驻济记者  陈勇进
    在黄河下游的南岸津浦、胶济两铁路的交叉点上，一座人民的新兴城市正在蓬勃成长着，这里便是山东省的首都—济南市。这座七十万人口的内地城市于去年十月为我陈粟大军所解放。
    解放后十个多月的济南市，如果从老残游记中所描绘过的大明湖、趵突泉等游览处所来看，确是比当年冷落了些，但如果从毛主席所指示的：“发展生产，繁荣经济，公私兼顾，劳资两利，城乡互助，内外交流”的“四面八方政策”上来观察，她已出现了一个新的姿态，她正从一个消费城市向着生产城市的道路迈进着。在大马路上或小巷里首先映入眼帘的是来自乡村的淳朴农民，他们紧张而愉快地吆喝着满载货物的马车或推着手车匆匆通过。在城内剪子巷，农民们以崭新的人民币换取着大量的镰刀、锅、剪等农具及日常用具。普利门里，裕兴颜料厂也拥挤着众多的农民；该店经理曾告诉记者：每月出产十万斤还不够卖。
    市工商局的墙壁上贴满了各种颜色的图表，其中一张是标志着上半年来自四乡的油类说明：豆油一○六一七○○斤，花生油二○八○○○○斤，香油八一五九○○、菜油、青油……。这些大部是来自豫北、冀南和平原省东部的广大农村。市贸易公司今年上半年共调拨小麦二千零九十万斤，小米一千二百余万斤，杂粮八百余万斤，买入棉花五十五万斤及火柴原料六十余万斤，保证了部分工业原料的供给。
    随着城乡物资的交流，济南各行业的客货代理业（即货栈）也急骤发展起来。解放前原有二百八十余家，现在已达六百三十一家（尚缺两行未统计）。
    济南市公私企业的恢复和发展，是在稳步的前进中完成了毛主席所指出的“生产长一寸”的任务。
    济南解放后的十个月中，由于全体职工的积极努力，公营全部六十个大小工厂，都已走向正常生产，其中包括恢复了解放前已停工多日的致敬灰厂、济南酒精厂、德和永染厂、人民纸厂、制革厂、济南化学厂、华兴纸厂、黄台酒精厂、济南电锯厂、砖瓦窑厂等十一个较大公营企业。职工们从实际中提高了政治觉悟，并树立了新的劳动态度。这次济南工代大会的代表中就有四十个男女代表是各厂的劳动英雄模范。各厂生产量除个别有特殊原因外都有增加。如仁丰纱厂解放前月产细布七四一九匹，现在已达八三二八匹，华兴纸厂解放前月产九一七三磅，现在增至八四七一九磅，军工第五厂的产量平均增加三倍半。
    在“发展有利国计民生的私营工商业”的原则下，济南市的私营工厂也获得了充分的发展。今年上半年政府除大力贷款予以扶植外，并帮助他们解决原料与销路困难。现全市除成丰、成记、丰年等三厂因战争关系损失严重一时不能复工外，其他私营工厂几已全部复工，并有的扩大了生产。成通纱厂本年内增设纱锭六千，钢丝机十台，织机三十台及锅炉一个。解放前月产四八八四○袋面粉的宝庆、华庆两厂，现在已达月产九九三一九袋的水平。小型机器制造业由解放前的九十八家增至目前的一一六家。颜料厂由十八家增至三十五家。
    私营工厂从恢复到发展中间，曾走过了一些曲折斗争的道路。解放之初，由于过去资方曾对工人有着过重的压迫和剥削，工人提出了增资及反对过重剥削的斗争。政府支持了工人们这一合理要求，但对其中某些过左的条件，也进行了说服教育，正确地解决了劳资纠纷。事后，虽然还有的资方怀疑是否今后要“平分”“斗争”，但经我大力宣传政策，特别是李立三同志“关于发展生产劳资两利”的文章发表及刘少奇同志在平津对产业界的讲话发表后，从基本上扫除了他们的思想顾虑，紧接着济市组织了平津参观团，从实际的体验中，他们完全认清了党的保护工商业的政策，而大胆进行生产了。
    由于我们在工业领导上还缺乏经验，所以还存有缺点：
    首先是生产中的盲目性。如被服局棉织厂的制毯厂，该厂解放前织军用毛毯，我接管后，领导上并未很好考虑原料及销路，即招工用旧棉织毯二万条，但因货劣价高，很难推销，只得停工，积压了资本。
    其次是没有从多方组织供销关系。渤海区三、四专区大量产硝，自大军南下后，军用停止，产品无出路，但此时济南颜料厂却缺硝二百万斤，无处购买，造成了此盈彼亏现象。
    市委及贸易公司对上述偏向已做了深刻检讨，进一步认识到城乡物资交流在今天经济建设中的重要性。为了今后更有效地开展这一工作，于八月三十一日正式组成了“生产建设促进委员会”，以便更有力地推动工作。
