【Tianjin News】In August, the Tianjin Communications Bank issued a total of 3 billion yuan in loans to help public and private factories overcome the slow sales season and enable them to rotate capital, purchase raw materials, and prepare to develop production in the peak season. Of this, 1.74 billion yuan was loaned to public factories and 1.25 billion yuan to private factories. For example, Tianjin Paper Company successively obtained 500 million yuan in order-based loans and 300 million yuan in credit loans, while North China Chemical Industry Company obtained 350 million yuan in credit loans and over 100 million yuan for purchasing finished products. This helped them overcome difficulties such as stagnant sales of finished products, lack of funds to purchase raw materials, and lack of freight for transporting goods to the south. In the private sector, companies such as Dongya Enterprise Company obtained 300 million yuan in order-based loans for麻袋(ma dai - gunny sacks), Jiuda Salt Industry Company obtained over 20 million yuan in price-indexed loans, and Danhua Match Company placed orders for 600 boxes of matches, all of which received assistance in capital turnover. In August's loans, order-based loans amounted to 1.19 billion yuan, with public factories accounting for 43% and private factories accounting for 57%; price-indexed loans amounted to 420 million yuan, with public factories accounting for 39% and private factories accounting for 61%; and credit loans and current overdrafts amounted to 1.4 billion yuan, with public factories accounting for 1.087 billion yuan and private factories accounting for 313 million yuan.

In the bank's August loans, there was a clear development in the two types of mutually beneficial loan businesses: order-based and price-indexed loans. These two lending methods were pioneered by the Communications Bank after liberation. At the beginning of their implementation, the bank was somewhat hesitant, defining the scope of price-indexed standards and order categories too narrowly. It was also somewhat subjective and mechanical in the agreed prices for orders, not taking sufficient care of the factory's interests. Moreover, the procedures were relatively cumbersome, and when prices tended to weaken, they were afraid to lend, adhering to a simple operating view of preserving the value of currency. At the beginning of August, the bank reviewed the above situation and decided to correct the previous shortcomings, clarifying that when prices tended to weaken, factories were precisely at a time of stagnant sales and poor capital turnover, and needed to be supported with loans. The standards for order categories and price indexing were also relaxed (previously, price indexing was based on only a few important materials such as yarn and flour, and orders were selected for mainstream, well-known brands). For example, Jiuda Company obtained a price-indexed loan of 25 million yuan on August 25, and the price-indexed standard was the company's main raw material, "coarse salt." In August, the number of order categories also increased significantly, including tires, cotton yarn, flour sacks, wire rods, lead wire, nails, needles, various types of paper,麻袋(ma dai - gunny sacks), and sodium sulfide.

　　津市交通银行
　  上月发放工贷卅亿
　  解决各公私工厂成品滞销等困难
    【天津讯】本市交通银行八月份共贷出款项三十亿元，扶助公私营工厂渡过了成品滞销的背月，并使资金周转，购进原料，准备在旺月发展生产。内贷给公营工厂十七亿四千余万元，私营工厂十二亿五千余万元。其中如天津造纸公司先后贷得定货贷款五亿元、信用贷款三亿元，华北化学工业公司贷得信用贷款三亿五千万元、收购成品一亿余万元，借以克服了成品滞销、无款购进原料、和货物南运缺乏运费等困难。私营工厂方面，如东亚企业工司贷得麻袋定货贷款三亿元，久大盐业公司贷得折实贷款二千余万元，丹华火柴公司定出火柴六百箱等，也都在资金周转上得到了扶助。在八月份贷款中，有定货贷款十一亿九千余万元，公营工厂占百分之四十三，私营占百分之五十七；折实贷款四亿二千余万元，公营占百分之三十九，私营占百分之六十一；信用贷款及活期透支十四亿元，其中公营占十亿八千七百余万元，私营三亿一千三百余万元。
    该行八月份贷款中，订货和折实这两种两利的贷款业务，有明显的开展。这两种贷款方式，是解放后才由交通银行创办的，施行之初，该行有些缩手缩脚，对折实标准、定货品类等范围规定的太狭窄，在定货的议定价格上也有些主观、机械，对厂方的利益照顾的不周到。而且手续比较繁琐，而在物价趋疲时，不敢放款，存有货币保本的单纯经营观点。八月初，该行对以上的情形作了检讨，决定纠正以往的缺点，明确了物价趋疲，厂方正是成品滞销、资金周转不灵的时候，尤需以贷款加以扶助。对定货品类、折实标准，也放宽了尺度（从前折实就按纱布面粉等几种重要物资、定货就选择大路货明牌子的。）例如久大公司在八月二十五日贷得折实贷款二千五百万元，折实的标准就是该公司主要原料“粗盐”。八月份定货品类也增加很多，有车胎、棉纱、面袋、盘条、铅丝、钉子、洋针、各种纸张、麻袋、硫化碱等。
