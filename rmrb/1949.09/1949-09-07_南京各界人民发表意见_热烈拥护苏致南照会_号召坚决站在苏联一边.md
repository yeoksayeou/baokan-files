Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, September 6th: After the Soviet reply and note to Yugoslavia were published in newspapers here, the preparatory committee of the Nanjing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, the working committee of the Communist Youth League, the preparatory committee of the Democratic Women's Federation, the chairman of the Nanjing Student Federation, and others issued written opinions. Professors from various universities also made speeches expressing their support and denouncing the Tito clique's counter-revolutionary behavior.

The preparatory committee of the Nanjing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions and the Democratic Women's Federation issued statements respectively calling on the working class and women to rise up and denounce the Tito clique.

The working committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League in Nanjing called on all youths and members of the Youth League in Nanjing to deeply study the lessons of the Tito clique's betrayal of the revolution and to strive to carry out internationalist study.

Sun Wang, a professor at the University of Nanking, said: "Today, if any country in the world leaves the revolutionary camp headed by the Soviet Union, it will inevitably move towards being destroyed by imperialism."

Liu Kairong, a professor at Ginling Women's College, said: There is absolutely no third road in the world. Whether an individual or a country, if it is not standing on the side of the progressive socialist camp, it will fall into the arms of reactionary imperialism.

Wu Bao-san, a researcher at the Institute of Social Sciences of the Academia Sinica, said: "The strength of the new democratic countries in Southeast Europe is growing, and they will never tolerate such a betrayal by Tito. At the same time, the people of Yugoslavia will not tolerate the reactionary behavior of the Tito reactionary clique."

The student unions of the University of Nanking and Ginling Women's College also issued statements calling on students to strengthen internationalist education and resolutely stand on the side of the socialist Soviet Union.
