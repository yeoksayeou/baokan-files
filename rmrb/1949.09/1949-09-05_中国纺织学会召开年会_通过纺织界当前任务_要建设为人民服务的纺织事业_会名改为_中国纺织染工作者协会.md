  　Passes Resolutions on Current Tasks of the Textile Industry
  　To Build a Textile Industry Serving the People
  　Society Name Changed to "China Textile Dyeing Workers Association"
    [Our Dispatch] Shanghai News: The Chinese Textile Society, with a history of twenty years, held its fourteenth annual meeting in Shanghai on the 20th and 21st of last month. The conference sent a telegram to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu to express their respect, stating that the meeting was convened "to rapidly restore the national textile industry and support the front lines." The meeting was filled with confidence that "under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, we will surely overcome all difficulties and build a new China's people's textile industry." More than 500 members attended. The meeting passed proposals to change the society's name to "China Textile Dyeing Workers Association," establish a textile industry bonus, found "Textile Workers" night schools in eastern and western Shanghai, and propose that the government preside over the establishment of a joint public-private organization to solve raw material and sales problems, and hold next year's annual meeting in Tianjin. Most importantly, the "Resolution on the Current Tasks of the Chinese Textile Industry" was passed. Its main content is to build an independent textile industry serving the Chinese people, combine the six major tasks to face the countryside, promote democratic management of factories, earnestly achieve production enterprise, and unite textile workers. Mayor Chen Yi delivered a speech at the meeting, hoping that the textile industry would change its direction in half a year or a year, and undergo fundamental changes in two years. He also called for changing thinking, resolutely overcoming difficulties, uniting, and being vigilant against new imperialist conspiracies. The conference successfully concluded after electing Su Yanbin, Gui Shizhi, and other 45 people (reserving four places for Taiwan and Chongqing, awaiting liberation areas) as members of the first executive committee of the China Textile Dyeing Workers Association.
