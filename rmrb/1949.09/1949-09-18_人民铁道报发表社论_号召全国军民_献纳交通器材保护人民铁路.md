Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, September 17th: The People's Railway News published an editorial on the 9th titled "Donate Transportation Equipment, Protect the People's Railways," calling on the nation's military and civilians to earnestly implement the "Measures for Collecting Railway Materials and Protecting Railways" promulgated by the Chinese People's Revolutionary Military Commission in mid-August. The editorial stated: China's railways, although built with the blood and sweat of the people, have been controlled by imperialists and reactionary classes for a long time, serving as tools for aggression and exploitation of the Chinese people. During the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation, the military and civilians in our liberated areas launched countless struggles to destroy roads in order to stop the Japanese invaders and the Kuomintang bandit troops from attacking, and to protect the lives and property of the people. This was entirely necessary and entirely correct at that time. However, the situation is now completely different, because with the rapid victory of the War of Liberation, most of the railways are in the hands of the people, and in the near future, all will become the property of the people. The nature of the railways has undergone a fundamental change; they are now serving the people; they have played and will continue to play a very important role in developing economic construction, exchanging goods between urban and rural areas, and continuing to support the War of Liberation. Our entire military and civilians should undergo a major transformation in their view of the railways; everyone should care about the railways, and everyone should cherish the railways. The editorial continued: From now on, destroying railways and railway materials is against the law, and protecting railways and donating railway materials is a revolutionary action. The editorial called on: In liberated areas where railways have not yet been repaired, railway employees, government cadres, and residents should actively donate the railway materials they have collected in the past so that the railways can be quickly repaired. For railways that have been repaired, the military and civilians along the line should take extra care to protect them and strictly prevent theft and sabotage. In unliberated areas, railway employees and the people should do everything possible to oppose the sabotage, transfer, and looting by the Kuomintang bandit troops, protect the integrity of the railways and materials, so that traffic can be restored immediately after liberation and support the People's Liberation Army to continue its advance.

　　人民铁道报发表社论
　  号召全国军民
　  献纳交通器材保护人民铁路
    【新华社北平十七日电】此间人民铁道报九日以“献纳交通器材，保护人民的铁路”为题发表社论，号召全国军民切实执行中国人民革命军事委员会于八月中旬所颁布的“搜集铁路器材及保护铁路的办法”。社论略称：中国的铁路，虽然是人民的血汗筑成的，但在过去很长的时间内，一贯为帝国主义、反动阶级所掌握，作为侵略、压榨中国人民的工具。在抗日战争和解放战争中，我解放区的军民，为了阻止日寇侵略和国民党匪军的进攻，为了保护人民的生命财产，曾展开无数次的破路斗争，这在当时是完全需要和完全正确的。但是，现在的情形已经完全不同，因为解放战争的迅速胜利，大部分的铁路已掌握在人民之手，不久的将来就会全部变为人民所有。铁路的性质已经起了根本变化，它已经是为人民而服务；在发展经济建设、交流城乡物资、继续支援解放战争等方面，已经起了并将继续起极重大的作用。我全体军民对铁路的看法都应该来个大转变，人人都应关心铁路，人人都应爱护铁路。社论继称：今后破坏铁路和破坏铁路器材就是犯法，今天保护铁路、献纳铁路器材才是革命的行动。社论号召：在已解放而铁路尚未修复地区，铁路职工、机关干部和居民群众应将过去收藏的铁路器材踊跃献纳出来，以便铁路得以迅速修复。对已修复的铁路，沿线军民则应加意保护，严防偷盗破坏。在未解放地区，铁路职工和人民群众要想尽办法，反对国民党匪军的破坏、转移和抢掠等，保护铁路和器材的完整，以便解放后即能恢复交通，支援解放军继续前进。
