Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 20th—The Shandong Provincial People's Government, in order to strengthen the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas, under the personal chairmanship of Chairman Kang Sheng and Vice Chairman Guo Zihua, convened a symposium on urban-rural exchange on the 11th of this month. The meeting was attended by 72 people, including the directors of the Jiaodong, Bohai, and Lunan Administrative Offices, commissioners of various special districts, mayors of various provincial cities, and representatives from various industries in Jinan's business and industry circles. At the meeting, representatives from various industries introduced the production and sales status of their respective industries and their need for raw materials, requesting the government to assist them in obtaining raw materials from the countryside and promoting the sale of finished products to the countryside, and suggested that the government develop highway transportation and shipping within the province. The directors and commissioners of the administrative offices also introduced the needs of farmers in various places for industrial products such as agricultural tools, waterwheels, fertilizers, insecticides, gauze, matches, and kerosene, as well as the production and sales of local products, and expressed their welcome to business and industry circles to go to the countryside for inspections and develop urban-rural material exchanges, with the government providing assistance. The provincial government also introduced various policies related to trade and taxation. Chairman Kang Sheng called on the meeting to strengthen urban-rural mutual assistance and develop production. He pointed out that the symposium promoted mutual understanding and communication between urban and rural areas, as well as mutually helpful relationships. He reported on the Shandong Provincial Government's recently decided tasks and plans for restoring and developing industrial and agricultural production, as well as the policy of state-owned industry and commerce facing the countryside and serving the countryside; he hoped that private industry and commerce would improve their operations and face the countryside. Finally, Chairman Kang Sheng proposed five specific measures for considering both public and private interests and connecting urban and rural areas: First, in the future, when the provincial government convenes meetings of administrative office directors, commissioners, and mayors, it will also invite representatives from business and industry circles to attend symposiums. Second, the provincial government can invite friends from business and industry circles to participate in discussions when discussing industrial and commercial issues. Third, each municipal government can jointly establish an institution such as a production and construction promotion committee with the business and industry circles of the city. Fourth, assist business and industry circles in going to the countryside for inspections and establishing connections with local state-owned enterprises and cooperatives. Fifth, organize exhibitions of urban-rural material exchanges. The results of this symposium greatly encouraged the business and industry circles in Jinan, and the city's Production and Construction Committee is now actively organizing an inspection group to prepare for an inspection of the countryside.
