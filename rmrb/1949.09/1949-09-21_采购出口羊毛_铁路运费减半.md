　　Purchasing Export Wool
  　Railway Freight Reduced by Half
    [Tianjin News] To reduce export costs and facilitate exporters in purchasing export goods from producing areas, the North China Foreign Trade Administration has obtained the approval of the Ministry of Railways. Starting from the 17th of this month, exporters purchasing wool and transporting it by rail, holding a certificate from the Administration, will receive a 50% reduction in current freight charges (according to the Ministry's regulations in late August, exporters holding certificates from provincial governments or above are also eligible). Furthermore, the Ministry of Railways will reclassify native medicinal materials to be charged at the 12th grade freight rate (originally the 7th grade) to encourage exports.
