　　Mid-Autumn Festival Support for Military Families
  　North China People's Government Issues Instructions
    [Ping City News] The North China People's Government recently issued instructions regarding support for military families during the Mid-Autumn Festival: 1. This Mid-Autumn Festival coincides with the autumn plowing and wheat planting season. Therefore, around the Mid-Autumn Festival, we should vigorously organize and assist (those lacking labor) families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel to plant wheat fields well and carry out autumn plowing. Each village should convene a meeting of families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel with the heads of cooperative farming groups to review the organization of production work for these families. It should be emphasized that the fertilization and sowing of wheat fields for families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel should be completed thoroughly before the Cold Dew solar term. There should also be a plan for the complete fulfillment of autumn plowing. 2. Inspire the masses to consciously and voluntarily provide appropriate comfort and necessary condolences to families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel. Offer some festive gifts to families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel who are particularly in difficult circumstances, so that they can all enjoy the festive life of the average local farmers. Villages that have received news of meritorious service should also take advantage of this festive season to mobilize the masses to congratulate the military families, but emphasis should be placed on spiritual encouragement. Oppose extravagance such as excessive eating and drinking, or even military families hosting guests, and other wasteful and unreasonable phenomena. 3. Mobilize and help military families write letters to soldiers, reporting on the organization and assistance provided to military families in their production; and provide more comfort and encouragement to boost the soldiers' fighting will.

　　中秋节优军
  　华北人民政府发布指示
    【平市讯】华北人民政府顷发出关于中秋节的优军工作指示：一、今年中秋，正是秋耕种麦时候，因此中秋节前后，应大力组织并帮助（对缺劳力者）烈、军属种好麦田，进行秋耕。各村应召开烈、军属与代耕组长座谈会，检讨组织烈、军属的生产工作。强调要于寒露节前彻底完成烈、军属的麦田施肥、播种工作。秋耕也应有全部完成的计划。二、启发群众自觉自愿的对烈、军属进行适当的慰劳和应有的慰问，对生活特别困难的烈、军属馈送些过节礼品，使他们都能享到当地一般农民过节的生活。接到立功喜报的村子，还可趁此佳节，发动群众向军属贺功，但应着重于精神鼓励，反对借此大吃大喝，甚至使军属请客等浪费与不合理现象。三、发动与帮助军属给军人写信，报告组织并帮助军属的生产情况；并多加安慰鼓励，以鼓舞军人战斗意志。
