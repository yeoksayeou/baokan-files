　　Production for Disaster Relief, Thrift for Famine Preparedness
    In the past twelve years, due to the repeated sabotage of river dikes by Japanese imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries in an attempt to flood our liberated areas, Party, government, and military personnel in various regions, in conjunction with the broad masses of the people, have waged heroic struggles, crushed the enemy's conspiracies, achieved considerable success in flood prevention and river management, and gained rich experience in fighting floods.

    Since the beginning of summer this year, the Party and the People's Governments in the North China, Central China, East China, and Northeast China liberated areas have foreseen the danger of flooding and have successively convened flood prevention meetings and issued urgent flood prevention instructions. North China even allocated 60 million catties of millet to repair rivers throughout the region, and water conservancy technicians from Tianjin and Beiping bravely participated in the river management projects. Various flood prevention organizations, such as flood prevention headquarters, rescue and transportation teams, emergency teams, and flood reporting stations, have been established in riverine areas of various liberated areas. Tianjin also established a telephone network along various rivers, and mobilized 250,000 citizens to participate in the emergency teams. Substantial preparations have been made in terms of leadership, organization, and manpower and material resources (flood prevention materials) in various regions.

    However, due to the long-term failure of the enemy, puppet regimes, and Kuomintang reactionaries to repair water conservancy and their deliberate sabotage, which is not easy to quickly restore, since the beginning of summer this year, various regions have experienced outbreaks of floods following insect plagues, droughts, windstorms, and hailstorms. Despite the all-out rescue efforts of the Party, government, military, and civilians in our liberated areas, the disaster situation is still extremely severe. The disaster-stricken area has spread to North China, Northeast China, East China, Central China, and other regions. Taking western Liaoning as an example, 23 counties have been affected, with approximately 430,000 hectares of cultivated land flooded, over 230,000 houses destroyed, over 20,000 head of livestock lost, and over 400,000 disaster victims. The Fuxin Coal Mine was also largely flooded and forced to suspend operations. The total area of ​​disaster-stricken land in the North China region is estimated to be between 20 million and 25 million mu, with a disaster-stricken population of approximately 5 million to 6 million, of which Hebei Province is the most severely affected. In the Central China region, the population affected by floods in Hubei Province alone had reached nearly 3 million by the end of July. After suffering from insect plagues, black locusts, and diseases in June, the Bohai, northern Anhui, and Huaiyin areas of East China suffered successive typhoon and flood disasters in July, with Shanghai, Jiaodong, northern Anhui, and Huaiyin being the most severely affected.

    However, under the strong leadership of our Party and the People's Government, with the completion of land reform in the old areas and encouraged by the victory of the national war, the military and civilians in various liberated areas have demonstrated a high degree of heroic and creative spirit, overcoming or continuing to overcome disasters, and have achieved brilliant results.

    Experience has proved that the Communists can not only lead the people in flood prevention, river management, and dike repair, but also lead the people in fighting drought, rescuing the injured, and overcoming all disasters. This is something that was absolutely impossible and could not be done during the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries.

    From the actual disaster relief struggle, the fact that "man can conquer nature" has been proven, thus breaking the "fate is predetermined" and pessimistic and despairing thoughts and emotions of some of the masses, enabling them to actively engage in production to overcome the famine and overcome all difficulties. As the masses in Shengfang Town, Hebei, said: "Man can conquer nature. We have two hands and the government's help. As long as we produce, we can save ourselves." Therefore, a mass production self-salvation movement has been launched in various regions. According to the production conditions in various regions, the masses have created various ways to overcome the famine, such as gathering wild vegetables, chopping firewood, quarrying stones, burning ash, making shoe soles, weaving mats, weaving baskets, spinning and weaving cloth, and weaving sacks. The masses also put forward the slogan "Rescue one mu and get one mu more, rescue one tree and get one tree more", and actively replant. For example, the masses in Hangzhou County, Zhejiang, helped each other to replant 50,000 mu, and cadres in Pingquan, Rehe, took the lead in replanting 10,000 mu of hailstorm-damaged land, and western Liaoning replanted 36,784 hectares of hailstorm-damaged farmland. At the same time, in addition to the emergency relief and work-for-relief provided by local governments, some state-owned stores or cooperatives also used methods such as lending grain to order cotton, lending grain to order chestnuts, purchasing on behalf, and transportation and sales to help the masses overcome the disaster. Cadres and the masses have found a way to survive in the struggle against the disaster, overcoming the purely relief-based view and the view of relying solely on relief.

    Countless experiences have also proved that we must widely organize the masses and give play to the power of the masses in order to overcome all disasters. And to make the masses truly act, we must first ensure that the chief leaders take responsibility and take the lead in doing things themselves, and that cadres and party members take the lead, in order to promote and persist in this victorious struggle. In many places, senior responsible cadres have personally taken action and set an example, influencing general cadres, party members, and the masses, and have also demonstrated unparalleled heroic behavior and created countless moving historical events.

    Now, although we have successfully passed the most serious summer flood season, the autumn flood season is about to arrive, and the disaster and difficulties still seriously threaten us. Therefore, in addition to carrying forward the spirit of heroic struggle and the creativity of production for self-salvation in the past, we must further mobilize and universally and continuously carry out the movement of production for disaster relief and thrift for famine preparedness, to welcome the autumn harvest and autumn planting, so as to strive for increased production next year and reduce the disaster.

    To this end, we should first continue to manage rivers and repair dikes to prevent autumn floods, and organize disaster victims to work for relief, dredging ditches and draining water, repairing ridges for planting, and preparing for autumn harvest and autumn planting, striving for one autumn planting, mobilizing the masses to universally select seeds, and ensuring more grain production next year.

    Secondly, since most of the disaster-stricken areas are in the countryside, the cities must support the countryside and truly achieve mutual assistance between urban and rural areas, transporting coal and grain to the disaster areas. At the same time, we must organize mutual assistance among the masses, and use what is available to help those who lack, and the central issue is to vigorously organize the masses to develop sideline occupations, organize supply and marketing cooperatives, lend grain and loans, purchase and order goods on behalf, and solve the difficulties of the masses in a timely manner.

    Thirdly, we must strictly implement streamlining and thrift. East China and Central China have already achieved results in this area, and should be promoted to the whole country immediately, and universally and continuously adhered to. Do not treat it as a temporary and local shock work. We must know that caring about the people's suffering and sharing weal and woe with the people is the characteristic of the Communists and all people's cadres, and streamlining and thrift is one of the indispensable preconditions for the development of long-term construction. Therefore, every party member should set an example and work hard for "developing production and prospering the economy."

    Finally, we urge all staff to strictly guard against the idea of ​​losing the countryside after entering the city. Factories and enterprises in the city must step up production to supply the needs of farmers. All scientific and technical personnel and intellectuals should continue to go to the countryside to participate in various rural construction works. Chairman Mao once instructed us: "The city leads the countryside," "Urban and rural areas must be taken into account." To enable industry to have raw materials and sales channels, it is necessary to do a good job in land reform, do a good job in agricultural production, and increase the purchasing power of farmers. Especially at a time when the vast rural areas are suffering from serious disasters, doing a good job in agricultural production, working hard in production for disaster relief, and thrift for famine preparedness have become urgent tasks.

### 生产救灾，节约备荒

　　生产救灾，节约备荒
    过去十二年来，由于日本帝国主义和国民党反动派屡次破坏各河堤防，企图水淹我解放区，各地党政军工作人员曾结合广大人民进行了英勇的斗争，粉碎了敌人的阴谋，使防汛治河工作获得相当成就，并取得与洪水搏斗的丰富经验。
    今年入夏以来，华北、华中、华东和东北各解放区党及人民政府，均预见了有水涝之患，即先后召集了防汛会议，发出了紧急防汛指示，华北更拨出小米六千万斤整修全区河流，平津水利技术人员亦奋勇参加了治河工程。各解放区沿河地区均纷纷成立了各种防汛组织，如防汛指挥部、救护交通队、抢险队、报汛站，天津各河还设有电话网，并动员了二十五万市民参加了抢险队。从领导上、组织上以及人力物力（防汛材料）上各地都进行了相当充分的准备工作。
    但是，由于敌伪国民党反动派在长期间不惟不修水利，反而百般破坏，不易迅速修复，以致今年入夏以来，各地继虫、旱、风、雹之后，水灾暴发。虽经我各解放区党政军民全力抢救，灾情仍极严重。受灾地区之广已及于华北、东北、华东、华中等地。以辽西为例，即被灾二十三县，被淹耕地约四十三万余垧，毁房二十三万余间，损失大小牲口二万余头，灾民达四十余万。阜新煤矿亦因大部灌水陷于停工。华北全区被灾土地，据估计则在两千万至两千五百万亩，受灾人口约在五百至六百万，其中尤以河北受灾最为严重。华中区仅湖北一省遭受水灾人口，至七月末已将近三百万，华东区渤海、皖北、淮阴等地区六月间遭受绵虫、黑＠、病灾后，复于七月间连遭台灾、水灾，以上海、胶东、皖北、淮阴等地区受灾最重。
    但是在我党及人民政府坚强领导下，在老区土地改革完成，在全国战争胜利鼓舞之下，各解放区军民均发扬了高度英勇创造的精神，战胜了或继续战胜着灾害，取得了辉煌的成绩。
    经验证明，共产党人不仅能领导人民防汛治河修堤，而且能领导人民抗旱、抢险，渡过一切灾难，这是国民党反动派统治时期所绝不会也不可能做到的。
    从实际的救灾斗争中，事实证明“人定胜天”，因而打破了一部分群众“听天由命”和悲观失望的思想情绪，得以积极进行生产渡荒，克服着一切困难。正如河北胜芳镇群众所说：“人定胜天，咱们有两只手，又有政府帮助，只要生产就可自救。”因之在各地已展开群众性的生产自救运动。根据各地生产条件，群众并创造了各种各样的渡荒办法，如打野菜、砍柴、打石、烧灰、纳鞋底、织席、编篓、纺线织布、织麻袋等。群众更提出“抢救一亩多得一亩，抢救一棵多得一棵”的号召，积极补种。如浙江杭县群众互助互济补种五万亩，热河平泉干部带头翻种完万亩雹砸地，辽西补种雹砸地三万六千七百八十四垧大田。同时，除各地政府拨粮急赈、以工代赈外，有些国营商店或合作社，也用贷粮订棉、贷粮订栗子、代购、运销等办法，来帮助了群众渡灾。干部与群众都在与灾害搏斗中，找到了生路，克服了单纯救济观点和单纯依靠救济的观点。
    无数次的经验也证明，必须把群众广泛组织起来，发挥群众的力量，才能战胜一切灾害。而要使群众真正行动起来，又必须首先做到首长负责亲自动手，干部党员带头，才能推动和坚持这一胜利的斗争。许多地方由于高级负责干部亲自动手，以身作则，影响了一般干部、党员和群众，同样表现了无比的英雄行为，创造了无数可歌可泣的史迹。
    现在我们虽然胜利地渡过了最严重的暑汛，但是秋汛又将到来，灾荒困难还严重地威胁着我们。因此，我们除了发扬过去英勇斗争的精神和生产自救的创造力之外，还必须进一步动员起来，普遍地长期地开展生产救灾，节约备荒的运动，迎接秋收秋种，以争取明年增产，减轻灾荒。
    为此，我们就应首先继续治河修堤预防秋汛，并组织灾民以工代赈，疏渠排水，修垄种地，并做好秋收秋耕的准备工作，争取秋耕一次，发动群众普遍选种，保证明年多产粮食。
    其次，因被灾地区大多在乡村，城市就必须支持乡村，切实做到城乡互助，把煤、粮运销到灾区去。同时要组织群众互助，并以有易无，而中心问题则是要大力组织群众开展副业，组织供销社，贷粮贷款，代购订实，及时解决群众的困难。
    第三，厉行精简节约。华东、华中各地在这方面已有成绩，应即推广到全国，普遍地长期地坚持下来，不要把它当作一时一地的突击性的工作。须知关心人民疾苦，与民共甘同苦，这正是共产党人以及一切人民干部的特色，而精简节约，又是发展长期建设所不可缺少的前提之一。因此，每一个党员均应以身作则，为“发展生产，繁荣经济”而艰苦奋斗。
    最后，我们更要求一切工作人员严防进了城市丢了农村的思想，住在城市里的工厂企业，要加紧生产，供给农民的需要。一切科学技术人员和知识分子们，继续到乡村去，参加乡村各种建设工作，毛主席曾指示我们：“城市领导乡村”，“城乡必须兼顾”，要使工业有原料有销路，就必须搞好土地改革，搞好农业生产，提高农民购买力，特别是在目前广大农村遭受严重灾荒的时候，搞好农业生产努力生产救灾，节约备荒，已成为刻不容缓的急务。
