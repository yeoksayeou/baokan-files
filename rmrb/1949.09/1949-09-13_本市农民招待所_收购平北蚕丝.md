　　Farmers' Hostel in This City
　  Purchases Pingbei Silkworm Silk
    [This Newspaper's Report] Rural areas in Pingbei, such as Miyun, Yihua, and Sihai, produce silkworm silk as a sideline. In previous years, most of it was sold to factories in this city to be made into silk thread, which was then sold to the Northwest and Suiyuan areas. This year, after the wheat harvest, farmers have again come to Beijing in groups of three to five to sell silk; however, due to the difficulty of promoting sales in the remaining Guomindang-controlled areas in the Northwest, and high taxes, and because summer is an off-season, factories lack the capacity to purchase raw materials. Farmers are unable to sell their products, and therefore cannot exchange them for the things they lack. The price has automatically depreciated from 4,600 yuan per jin to 3,800 yuan per jin, but there are still no buyers.
    In order to protect the interests of farmers, the Farmers' Hostel of the Beijing Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative has decided to purchase silk, and, taking into account the farmers' costs, buys it at 4,000 to 4,100 yuan per jin. After selling their silk, the farmers exchanged it for the cloth, coarse grains, and farm tools they needed, and introduced their fellow villagers to come as well. By the end of August, a total of more than 1,000 jin of silk had been purchased. At the same time, the Farmers' Hostel purchases silk and can supply it to various factories at appropriate prices when they have the capacity to buy it. This avoids hoarding and profiteering by merchants and also protects the interests of the factories. (Zheng Zhong)

　　本市农民招待所
　  收购平北蚕丝
    【本报讯】平北密云、乙化、四海一带，农村副产蚕丝。往年多销给本市厂家作成丝线，再行销西北绥远一带。今年麦秋过后，农民们又三五成群来平售丝；但由于到西北残余国统区推销困难，捐税又大，夏季是背月，厂家没有力量收购原料。农民们出脱不了自己的产品，也就不能换取他缺少的东西，由每斤四千六百元自动贬价到三千八百元，还是无人问津。
    北平市供销合作总社农民招待所，为了保障农民利益，便决定进行收丝，并照顾农民工本，按每斤四千至四千一百元收买。农民们卖丝之后，换回了自己需要的布匹、粗粮和农具，并把他的老乡都介绍了来，到八月底止，共收丝千余斤。同时，农民招待所收了丝，到各厂家有力购买时即可以适当价格供应，这样便避免了囤积商的居奇牟利，也维护了厂家的利益。　（郑重）
