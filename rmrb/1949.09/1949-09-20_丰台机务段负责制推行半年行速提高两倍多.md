　　Fengtai Locomotive Depot Implements Responsibility System, Speed Increases More Than Twofold in Six Months
　　[Ping City News] Since March of this year, the Fengtai Locomotive Depot has absorbed the advanced experiences of the Soviet Union and Northeast Railways and implemented the locomotive responsibility system, achieving remarkable results in the past six months. The average daily mileage per locomotive in March was 135.4 kilometers, which increased to 308.9 kilometers in August. The technical speed increased from 33.6 kilometers in May to 46 kilometers in August. Fuel consumption was 417 kilograms per 10,000 gross tons in March, which was reduced to 346 kilograms in July.
　　Under the planned cultivation in leadership and the help of the "Mao Zedong" locomotive crew, Nos. 冖＠—762, 1939, 1727, and 1506 of the Fengtai Locomotive Depot have become model locomotives. Driven by these four locomotives, all locomotives in the depot are striving to improve safe running mileage and technical speed, maintain the good condition of locomotives, and save fuel. No. 冖＠—762 proposed a challenge plan to all locomotive depots in the country during the "May Day" to travel 15,000 kilometers in two months, which was completed on June 24. No. 冖＠—1939 continuously broke through the 10,000-kilometer mileage in July and August. The highest daily mileage of No. 冖＠—1506 once reached 721.8 kilometers.
　　On June 2, the entire depot formulated a collective safety running plan of 150,000 kilometers. Although this plan was disrupted by a signal failure, they were not discouraged, but worked harder. On July 18, a new plan for collective safe running of 300,000 kilometers was formulated to welcome the October Revolution Day.

　　丰台机务段负责制推行半年行速提高两倍多
    【平市讯】丰台机务段自今年三月起，吸收苏联与东北铁路的先进经验，推行了机务负责制，半年来已获显著成绩。机车平均日车公里，三月份是一三五·四公里，八月份提高到三○八·九公里。技术速度由五月份的三三·六公里，提高到八月份四六公里。燃料消耗在三月份是每万公吨四一七公斤，到七月份已减到三四六公斤。
    在领导上有计划的培养与“毛泽东号”乘务员的帮助下，丰台机务段的冖＠—七六二、一九三九、一七二七、一五○六号都已成为典型机车。在这四台机车带动之下，全段机车都朝着提高安全走行公里与技术速度，保持机车状态良好与节省燃料努力。冖＠—七六二号在“五一”向全国机务段提出两个月走行一万五千公里的挑战计划，在六月二十四号就完成了。冖＠—一九三九号在七、八两月份连续突破一万公里的走行公里。冖＠—一五○六号最高日车公里曾达七二一·八公里。
    六月二日全段曾订出一个集体安全走行十五万公里的计划，这个计划虽然为一次冒出信号事故所破坏，但他们并不灰心，反而更加努力。七月十八日又订出集体安全走行三十万公里的新计划，这个计划是为迎接十月革命节的。
