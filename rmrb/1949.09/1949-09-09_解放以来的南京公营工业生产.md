Compared to Shanghai, Tianjin, and even Wuxi, Nanjing's industrial production is not very developed. Moreover, it was further devastated by the Kuomintang bandit gang. By the time of Nanjing's liberation, it was even more dilapidated. After liberation, these industries, though with weak foundations, have been fully or largely restored under the active management or assistance of the People's Government. Taking public industries as an example, the output of many factories has exceeded the level during the Kuomintang rule. Some factories have changed their production policies, facing agriculture and taking on the task of connecting urban and rural economies. Even a chemical factory that had been planned for three years without ever starting operation during the Kuomintang rule, started operation in less than three months after liberation.

Currently, the important public industrial and mining enterprises in Nanjing include the Ma'anshan Pyrite Mine, Radio Factory, Telephone Factory, Porcelain Factory, Electric Lighting Factory, China Agricultural Machinery Company, and the Machinery Factory of the Municipal Construction Bureau. Among them, the nationally known Ma'anshan Pyrite Mine once reached a record of producing 300 tons of pyrite per day. However, in the three years since the Japanese surrender under Kuomintang rule, the number of workers at the mine decreased from more than 600 to more than 100. A large amount of raw materials and fuel were also looted by the bandit troops before their escape, leaving it in a state of near collapse. After Nanjing's liberation, under the active management of the People's Government, the mine's funds were restored and operations started in June. Now the number of workers at the mine has increased to more than 350, and the daily output has increased from 51 tons before liberation to 86 tons. Other units, such as the Telephone Factory, Radio Factory, Porcelain Factory, and Electric Lighting Factory, have increased their number of employees by 30% to 75% compared to before liberation. Except for the Porcelain Factory, the output of all has exceeded the pre-liberation level. Among them, the output of the Telephone Factory has increased nearly 20 times compared to before liberation, with a total production of 1,500 telephone switchboards and 500 telephones in more than three months. Before liberation, the factory produced only 100 telephones between July and December last year. The China Agricultural Machinery Company and the Machinery Factory of the Municipal Construction Bureau have both changed their production policies to serve the countryside. Although the company also manufactured agricultural machinery before liberation, these machines were either too expensive for farmers to afford or did not suit the actual needs of the countryside. Therefore, in the eight months before liberation, the company only sold two rice milling machines. After liberation, considering the purchasing power of farmers, it changed to producing products currently needed by farmers, such as oil presses, cotton gins, and improved plows. Although the number of workers has decreased by 39 compared to before liberation, the total value of production has doubled, and sales are gradually expanding. In addition, the factory used some surplus labor to manufacture rice milling machines, charcoal stoves, and smaller auto parts. This income, converted into rice, has reached 740 shi (a unit of dry volume) in the past four months, which can solve one-fifth of the factory's total expenses. The Machinery Factory of the Construction Bureau has also changed from repairing and manufacturing weapons and military supplies before liberation to producing supplies needed by the countryside. Sales have gradually increased, and it has achieved self-sufficiency by July.

Without the active management of the People's Government, the rapid recovery of these factories would be unimaginable. Look at the dilapidated picture at the time of liberation. Among the more than 70 lathes in the Construction Bureau's Machinery Factory, less than 10 were usable when it was taken over. The Radio Factory was not only forced to relocate by the bandit gang, suffering losses, but also owed debts worth six gold bars, making it very difficult to resume work after liberation. When the China Agricultural Machinery Company was first taken over, the tools were scattered and lost, and there was a huge deficit. The electricity bill alone owed the power plant more than 11,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity, worth about 700,000 yuan. Lack of funds, heavy debts, and incomplete equipment paralyzed Nanjing's industry at the time of liberation. Just to start resuming production, the People's Government successively allocated more than 30 million yuan and purchased a large number of finished products.

Naturally, the rapid recovery of various factories in Nanjing is also due to the efforts of the employees of each factory. In the four months since Nanjing's liberation, the employees' enthusiasm for production has been constant, widespread, and significant. The production plans of the factories are often lagging behind the great achievements obtained by the employees' labor and work. The employees of the China Agricultural Machinery Company completed the two-month production plan in 40 days. The current production volume of 120 workers in the Porcelain Factory is equal to that of 180 workers in the past. A technician in the Chemical Factory insisted on working for 24 consecutive hours on the eve of the start of operation. He refused others' advice to rest. He said, "I have been waiting for the day to start operation for three years. The Communist Party came to realize it. What does it matter to work a few more hours!"

The creativity and initiative of the employees played an especially clear role in overcoming the difficulties aggravated by the enemy's blockade and promoting production. The Ma'anshan Pyrite Mine is a famous mining area in my country for producing sulfuric acid. During the period of Japanese and Kuomintang rule, sulfur production was carried out, but the highest extraction rate at that time was only 5%. After liberation, through the research and design of the mine's engineers, the principle of extracting sulfur by indigenous methods was improved. Continuous refining was adopted by using a circulating furnace, and the temperature was accurately controlled. As a result, not only was time, labor, and fuel saved compared to the past, but also the extraction rate exceeded the highest record during the enemy and puppet rule by more than two times. Yin Yousan, deputy engineer of the Electric Lighting Factory, also improved the efficiency of light bulb production by more than two times after modifying the model for manufacturing light bulbs. The employees of the Porcelain Factory improved the kiln firing technology, reducing the amount of coal burned per kiln from 30 tons to 21 tons; the loss rate per kiln was also reduced from 35% to 15%, and it continues to decrease. The charcoal stove designed and installed by the China Agricultural Machinery Company plays a major role in transforming machines powered by gasoline under conditions of gasoline scarcity. In addition, saving materials and utilizing waste materials have also made great achievements in various industrial and mining enterprises and have become a new trend in various factories and enterprises since liberation.

Due to the rapid restoration of transportation in the vast areas north and south of the Yangtze River, the sales of various factories and mines are also becoming smoother. The Electric Lighting Factory has set up distribution points in Xuzhou, Bengbu, and other places, and transported a large number of light bulbs to Hankou. The Porcelain Factory has also accepted a large number of orders from coal mines such as Huainan. The sales of chemical factory products are also not difficult. Taking the eight tons of dinitrobenzene (black dye) produced by the factory every month as an example, it is not enough for Shanghai alone. The difficulty in selling some finished products in other factories is also a temporary phenomenon. With the complete smooth flow of transportation and trade between urban and rural areas and regions, these difficulties will gradually be resolved.

### 解放以来的南京公营工业生产

　　解放以来的南京公营工业生产
    和上海、天津甚至无锡比较起来，南京的工业生产是不太发达的；再加上国民党匪帮的摧残，到南京解放时，便越发残破不堪了。解放以后，这些基础虽然薄弱的工业，在人民政府的积极经营或扶助下，已先后全部或大部复工。拿公营工业来说，许多工厂产量已超过了国民党统治时的水平，有的工厂改变生产方针，面向农业，担负起沟通城乡经济的任务，甚至在国民党统治时期筹划三年之久而未曾开工的化学工厂，解放后不到三个月也开工了。
    目前南京重要的公营工矿企业有马鞍山硫化铁矿、无线电厂、有线电厂、电瓷厂、电照厂、中国农业机械公司、市建设局机械厂等单位。其中闻名全国的马鞍山硫化铁矿，最盛时代曾达到日产硫化铁三百吨的纪录。但在日寇投降后国民党统治的三年多以来，该矿工人由六百多减到一百多人，大量原料燃料亦被匪军们在逃窜前洗劫，陷于奄奄一息的地步。南京解放后，在人民政府的积极经营下，该矿资金得以流转并于六月开工。现在该矿工人已增至三百五十多人，日产量由解放前的五十一吨增至八十六吨。其他如有线电厂、无线电厂、电瓷厂、电照厂等单位，职工人数较解放前都增加百分之三十到七十五不等，产量除电瓷厂外都已超过解放前水平。其中有线电厂的产量较解放前提高了将近二十倍，计三个多月内共生产交换机一千五百门，电话机五百部。解放之前，该厂于去年七月到十二月期间，共只生产电话机一百部。中国农业机械公司和市建设局机械厂，均转变生产方针，为农村服务。该公司在解放前虽然也制造农业机器，但这些机器不是成本太贵，农民买不起，便是不恰合农村实际需要。因此解放前八个月中，该公司只销售了两部碾米机。解放后则照顾农民购买力的情况，改制农民目前需用的产品如榨油机、弹花机、改良犁等，虽然工人较解放前减少了三十九人，但生产总值却提高了一倍，而且销路日渐宽广。此外，该厂又以一部剩余劳动力制造碾米机、木炭炉以及较小的汽车零件等。此项收入以大米折算四个月来即达七百四十石，可解决该厂全部开支的五分之一。建设局机械厂也由解放前的修造武器军用品改为生产农村需用品，销路因而逐步推广，七月份已做到保本自给。
    如果没有人民政府的积极经营，这些工厂的迅速恢复将是不可想象的事。看看刚解放时那幅残破的图画吧。建设局机械厂在七十多部车床中，接收时能用的不足十部。无线电厂不但被匪帮胁迫搬迁遭受损失，而且欠了值六根金条的债务，使解放后复工大感困难。中国农业机械公司开始接收时，也是工具散乱遗失，亏空甚巨，仅电费一项即欠了电厂一万一千余度电力的费用，约值七十多万元。资金无着，债务累累，设备残缺，使南京工业在刚解放时陷于瘫痪状态。仅仅为了开始复工生产，人民政府即先后拨款达三千多万元，另外还大批地收购成品。
    自然，南京各工厂的迅速恢复元气，还由于各厂职工的努力。在南京解放后的四个多月来，职工们的生产热情是经常、普遍和显著的。各厂的生产计划常常都是落在职工们劳动工作所获得的巨大成绩后面。中国农业机械公司两个月的生产计划，职工们四十天就完成了。电瓷厂现在一百二十个工人的生产总量，等于过去一百八十个工人。化学工厂一位技工，在开工前夕曾连续坚持工作二十四小时。他拒绝了别人要他休息的劝告。他说：“三年来等待着开工的日子，共产党来了才实现，多做几个钟头算什么！”
    职工们的创造性和积极性对克服因敌人的封锁而加重的困难和推进生产所起的作用，表现得格外显明。马鞍山硫化铁矿为我国出产硫酸＠著名的矿区，在日寇和国民党统治时期，即进行炼硫生产，但当时蒸取率最高只到百分之五。解放后经该矿工程师们的研究设计，按照土法提硫原理加以改良，采由循环式炼炉连续提炼，并精确掌握了温度，结果不但较前节省了时间人力和燃料，而且蒸取率超过敌伪统治时期最高纪录二倍以上。电照厂副工程师尹友三改制制造灯泡的模型后，也使灯泡的生产效率提高了两倍多。电瓷厂职工改进了烧窑技术，每窑烧煤由三十吨减至二十一吨；每窑出货的损失率亦由百分之三十五减到百分之十五，并在继续减低。中国农业机械公司设计装置的木炭炉，在汽油困难的条件下，对改造用汽油发动的机器，作用亦大。此外，节省材料，利用废料，在各工矿中也有很大成绩，并成为解放以后各个工厂企业中一种新的风气。
    由于大江南北广大地区的交通迅速恢复，各厂矿的销路亦日渐畅通。电照厂已在徐州蚌埠等地设了分销处，并运了大批灯泡赴汉口。电瓷厂亦接受了淮南等煤矿的大量订货。化学工厂产品销路亦无大困难，以该厂每月所产的八吨二硝基＠化苯（黑色染料）为例，尚不够上海一地采用。其他工厂部分成品销路的困难，也是暂时现象。随着城乡区际间交通贸易的完全畅通，这些困难将逐渐得到解决。
