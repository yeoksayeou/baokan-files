Clothing Factory Responds to Readers' Opinions

Editor:

　　The opinions raised in the article "Certain Medical Staff at Clothing Factory Disregard Workers' Health" published in your newspaper on September 13th are very accurate. After this matter occurred, we immediately conducted a review and made corrections. Here, we will make another public review and explanation as follows:

　　The accounts provided by Tao Yuanzhang and Liang Qingwu are essentially consistent with the facts, so the details of the incident will not be repeated. There is indeed a phenomenon of individual medical staff in our factory being indifferent to the workers; their old views and old work styles have not been well reformed, resulting in a lack of serious responsibility in their work. They look down on the working people, are impatient and unenthusiastic towards patients, and even express annoyance. This led to two unfortunate incidents, increasing the suffering of the workers, affecting production tasks, and causing losses to the country. After the incidents occurred, the leadership reported to the Quartermaster Department to send doctors for treatment (those who took the wrong medicine were immediately sent to the hospital), and organized a慰问团 (comfort group) to visit the homes of the workers. On the other hand, the negligent medical staff were educated and dealt with. After their self-reflection and in-depth education through group meetings and general meetings, with the approval of the superior authorities, nurse Kang Zhiping was dismissed from the factory, and medical assistant Huang Zhizhong was demoted and reassigned to other work by the superior authorities. Based on this lesson, we have conducted extensive education among all staff members, especially all medical personnel, who feel this is a great disgrace. They unanimously expressed that they will strengthen political study in the future, overcome old views and work styles, establish new views and work styles of serving the workers, and ensure that such incidents do not happen again.

### 失职医务人员分别开除撤职　被服厂答复读者意见

　　失职医务人员分别开除撤职
  　被服厂答复读者意见编者：
    阅九月十三日贵报载：“被服厂某些医务人员漠视工人健康”一稿所提的意见，很对。这件事情发生后，我们立即作了检讨与纠正。在此我们再作公开的检讨和说明如下：
    陶元张、梁清武所提，基本上符合于事实，故事情经过就不赘述了。本厂个别医务人员确实存在着对工人漠不关心的现象，他们的旧观点、旧作风，尚未很好的改造，因之表现工作上缺乏严肃的责任心。看不起劳动人民，对病人不耐心，不热情，甚至表示厌烦。于是造成了两次不幸事件，增加了工人的痛苦，影响了生产任务，造成了国家的损失。事情发生以后，领导上一面报告军需部派医生去治疗（吃错药者当即送往医院），和组织慰问团到各工人家中慰问。一面对过失医务人员进行了教育和处理。经过他们反省检讨，小组会和大会的深入教育，最后经上级机关批准，护士康之萍开除出厂，医助黄志忠撤职后交上级另行分配工作。根据这一教训，我们在全体职员中进行了广泛的教育，尤其是全体医务人员，更觉着这是一个大的耻辱。他们一致表示今后要加强政治学习，克服旧的观点和作风，树立为工人服务的新观点、新作风，保证不再发生此类事件。 　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　北平被服厂
