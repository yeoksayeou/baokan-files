　　Unified Leadership Over the Entire Region's Financial and Economic Work
    East China Financial and Economic Committee Established
    Political Commissar Rao Shushi Reports on Work Guidelines and Tasks

    [Special Dispatch from Our Correspondent in Shanghai, 25th] The East China Financial and Economic Committee was officially established on the 24th under the order of the East China Military Region, to unify the leadership of financial and economic work in the entire East China region. This marks the end of the takeover work in Shanghai, and the financial and economic work in Shanghai will embark on a more standardized path. It also marks the establishment of a more rational and appropriate relationship between the economies of various parts of East China in the future. The inauguration ceremony was held at the Grand Theater at 6 p.m., attended by representatives of the East China Bureau, Political Commissar Rao Shushi, Deputy Mayor Pan Hannian, Chairman of the Trade Union Preparatory Committee Liu Changsheng, representatives of the Federation of Industry and Commerce, and guests from various agencies, totaling more than 2,000 people. Political Commissar Rao Shushi pointed out at the meeting the working principles and future tasks of the Financial and Economic Committee. He said that the establishment of the East China Financial and Economic Committee is to unify the leadership of financial and economic work in the entire East China region, to better implement the Party Central Committee's guidelines and tasks on economic and financial work, and to more effectively overcome difficulties and serve the people. After explaining that developing production, prospering the economy, ensuring supply, and supporting the war is the general guideline of our party's current economic and financial work, and that financial work should be based on the development of the economy, Political Commissar Rao further pointed out that in order to implement the general task of developing production and supporting the war, the following seven tasks must be resolutely implemented and effectively completed: (1) We must first reorganize, restore, and develop the state-owned economy, which is the economic lifeline controlled by the people's state and the leading component of the national economy. (2) We must resolutely protect private national industry and commerce; in the relationship between public and private sectors, we must adhere to the principle of taking both public and private interests into account; in the relationship between labor and capital, we must resolutely adopt the policy of benefiting both labor and capital. (3) We must strengthen mutual assistance between urban and rural areas and promote the exchange of domestic and foreign trade. (4) We must quickly restore and develop transportation industries such as railways, highways, and shipping. (5) We must correctly grasp financial and monetary policies and pay attention to stabilizing the market. (6) We must properly organize tax collection and improve various financial and economic systems and institutions. (7) We must strengthen learning, improve technology, promote a diligent, simple, honest, and selfless work style, and oppose corruption and bureaucracy. Finally, Political Commissar Rao concluded his report with powerful words, saying: "The imperialists, at the instigation of the Kuomintang reactionaries, are using blockades to undermine our production and construction. They are waiting for the collapse of our Shanghai every day. However, with Chairman Mao's correct leadership, the great strength of the working class, the peasant class, the petty bourgeoisie, and the national bourgeoisie, who are united, and the experience of more than 20 years of arduous struggle and overcoming all difficulties, we will certainly not collapse, and we can certainly overcome any difficulties and strive for the victory of the New Democratic construction. Moreover, our Shanghai has achieved initial victories in many aspects such as resisting the imperialist blockade and restoring production and stabilizing the market."

　　统一领导全区财经工作
    华东财经委会成立
    饶漱石政委报告工作方针任务
    【本报记者二十五日上海专电】华东区财政经济委员会奉华东军区命令于二十四日正式成立，统一领导华东全区财政经济工作。这标志着上海的接管工作已经告一段落，上海的财经工作将要走上更加正规化的道路，同时也标志着今后华东各地的经济将建立一种更合理更适当的关系。成立典礼于下午六时假大光明戏院举行，到会的有华东局代表，饶漱石政委、潘汉年副市长、总工会筹备会主任刘长胜及工商业联合会代表、各机关来宾等二千余人。饶漱石政委在会上指明财经委员会工作方针与今后任务。他说，成立华东区财经委员会，是为了统一全华东区财经工作的领导，是为了更好执行党中央关于经济工作、财政工作的方针与任务，是为了更有效克服困难和为人民服务。饶政委在说明发展生产、繁荣经济、保障供给、支援战争是我党目前经济工作与财政工作的总方针，并应当把财政工作放在发展经济的基础上面之后，便进而指出为着贯彻发展生产支援战争的总任务起见，必须坚决执行和有效完成下列七项任务，即：（一）必须首先整理恢复与发展国营经济，这是人民国家所掌握的经济命脉，是国民经济的领导成分。（二）必须坚决保护私营民族工商业，在公私关系上，必须坚持采取公私兼顾的方针；在劳资关系上，必须坚决采取劳资两利的政策。（三）必须加强城乡互助，促进内外贸易交流。（四）必须迅速恢复和发展铁路公路航运等交通运输事业。（五）必须正确掌握金融货币政策及注意稳定市场。（六）必须很好整理税收，健全财经各种制度和机构。（七）必须加强学习，提高技术，提倡勤劳朴素廉洁奉公的作风，反对贪污及官僚主义。最后饶政委以有力的语句来结束他的报告，他说：“帝国主义指使国民党反动派用封锁的办法来破坏我们生产建设，他们天天在等待着我们上海的垮台；可是，我们有毛主席正确的领导，有工人阶级、农民阶级、小资产阶级及民族资产阶级巩固团结的伟大力量，有二十多年来坚苦奋斗和克服着一切困难的经验，我们一定不会垮台，我们一定可以克服任何困难，争取新民主主义建设的胜利。而且我们上海对于帝国主义的封锁和对于恢复生产与稳定市场等许多方面，已获得了初步的胜利。”
