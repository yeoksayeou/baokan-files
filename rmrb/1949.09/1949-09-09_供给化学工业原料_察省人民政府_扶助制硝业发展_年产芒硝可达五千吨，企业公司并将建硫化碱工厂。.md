　　Supplying Raw Materials for the Chemical Industry
  　The Chahar Provincial People's Government
  　Supports the Development of Nitre Production
    Annual Production of Mirabilite Can Reach 5,000 Tons, and the Enterprise Company Will Also Build a Sodium Sulfide Factory.
    [Chahar News] Mirabilite, one of the indispensable raw materials in the chemical industry, is a specialty of Yanggao County in southern Chahar. It can be made into sodium sulfide, sodium sulfate, sulfur blue and other dyes and medicines, and can also be used to make leather (tanned leather). After liberation, Yanggao's nitre industry, with the support and encouragement of the People's Government, has developed on a large scale, with an annual output of up to 5,000 tons, sold to factories in Tianjin, Hangu, and Zhangjiakou. In order to meet the needs of the broad masses of urban and rural people and solve the livelihood problems of farmers in the nitre-producing areas, the Chahar Provincial Enterprise Company is now preparing to build a sodium sulfide (black pigment) factory, which is expected to start construction in a month.
    The saline-alkali滩地 in the seventeen villages of Wujiahe, Panjiatun, Wangjiatun, Liujiatun, and Xishuangsai in the southeast of Yanggao City is the nitre-producing area, which is forty li long from east to west and four, five, six, or seven li wide from north to south, covering an area of approximately more than 200,000 mu. More than 15,000 farmers rely on this for their livelihoods. Every year, during the spring and autumn seasons, there are six or seven months of nitre production. People use native methods to produce crude nitre, which is then refined into Caoda (i.e., dry mirabilite; every four tons of crude nitre can be made into one ton of Caoda). The crude nitre produced in the county was initially only used for tanning leather, and its sales were limited to leather workshops in Zhangjiakou and Xuanhua. Caoda began to be exported in the 28th and 29th years of the Republic of China (1939-1940). During the Japanese occupation, private nitre boiling was prohibited, and it was forcibly purchased at low prices. During the rule of the Kuomintang bandit gang, it was controlled and monopolized by bureaucratic capital, exploiting the interests of nitre producers and imposing exorbitant taxes and levies. As a result, the products were of poor quality, and their reputation was greatly damaged. Sales were blocked, and the annual output was only about 2,000 tons.
    After the liberation of the area last year, the People's Bank successively granted the industry loans of 4 million yuan, promoted cooperatives, and directly dispatched cadres to organize. Therefore, nitre factories were generally established in the nitre-producing villages, reaching 21 locations. Each day they can produce more than 20 tons of Caoda. The Luowenzao Limin Nitre Factory in the ninth district has 28 employees and produces more than 2 tons of Caoda per day. The Chahar Provincial Enterprise Company has raised 9 million yuan to go to Yanggao to purchase mirabilite. The Heji and Dexing factories in Tianjin and Hangu have also sent people to purchase in large quantities. At that time, the market price was about 145,000 yuan per ton, or about 70 yuan per jin, which was more than twelve times higher than in the past. Under these circumstances, this rural nitre-making sideline industry will be developed on a larger scale.

### 供给化学工业原料　察省人民政府　扶助制硝业发展  年产芒硝可达五千吨，企业公司并将建硫化碱工厂。

　　供给化学工业原料
  　察省人民政府
  　扶助制硝业发展
    年产芒硝可达五千吨，企业公司并将建硫化碱工厂。
    【察哈尔讯】化学工业上不可缺少的原料之一——芒硝是察南阳高县的特产。它可制成硫化碱、元明粉、硫化青等各种染料及药品，也可用以制皮革（熟皮）。解放后的阳高硝业，在人民政府的扶助与奖励下，大规模的开展起来，年产可达五千吨，行销天津、汉沽、张家口各工厂。察省企业公司为了供应广大城乡人民之需要，和解决产硝区农民生活问题，现正着手筹建硫化碱（黑色颜料）工厂，预计一个月后即可开工。
    阳高城东南吴家河、潘家屯、汪家屯、柳家屯、西双塞等十七村的盐碱滩地为产硝区，东西长四十里，南北宽四、五里或六、七里不等，面积约有二十余万亩，一万五千多农民依此为生，每年春秋两季有六、七个月的产硝期，人们用土法制出土硝，再精制成曹达（即干芒硝，每四吨土硝可制成曹达一吨）。该县所产之土硝，最初仅用以熟皮，销路只限于张、宣等地皮房，民国二十八、九年始有曹达输出。日寇统治时，禁止私人熬硝，并低价强收。国民党匪帮统治时又为官僚资本所把持、垄断，剥削硝户利益，滥施苛捐杂税，故产品低劣，信誉大失，销路闭塞，年产仅二千吨左右。
    去年该地解放后，人民银行先后予该业贷款四百万元，推进社并直接派干部组织，因此产硝各村普遍成立硝厂达二十一处，每日可产曹达二十吨以上，九区罗文皂利民硝厂，有职工二十八人，日产曹达二吨以上。察省企业公司已筹款九百万元前往阳高收购芒硝，天津、汉沽两地的合记、德兴工厂亦曾派人前来大批收买。当时市价每吨约十四万五千元左右，每斤七十元左右，较过去提高到十二倍以上。在此情形下，这一农村制硝副业将会更大规模地开展起来。
