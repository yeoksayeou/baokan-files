  　Invites Reporters from Various Newspapers to a Symposium
    [This Newspaper's News] Yesterday afternoon (the 6th) at 3:00 PM, the New China Women's Society of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation hosted a symposium for reporters and editors from various newspapers. More than ten reporters and editors from the People's Daily, Worker's Daily, Progress Daily, Guangming Daily, Xinmin News, and China Youth Society attended. First, Shen Zijiu, editor-in-chief of New China Women, introduced the editorial policy, content, distribution, and other information. Since the National Women's Congress decided to publish a national women's publication, New China Women has already published two issues. Its main task is to guide the current women's movement throughout the country, analyze women's issues from a Marxist-Leninist perspective, reflect women's movements in various regions, and introduce the actual living conditions of women in various regions to help the cause of women's liberation. The content includes women's movement literature, policies, papers, women's lives in various regions, women's work correspondence, child care work, introductions of female heroes and models, and international women's movements. Currently, more than 15,000 copies have been distributed in the North China region, and many have also been sold in the Northeast, Shanghai, and Xi'an. Afterwards, reporters and editors from various newspapers offered their opinions on this publication. Everyone unanimously believed that New China Women was compiled very substantively, but hoped that it could be made more popular, more connected to reality, and publish more short, popular articles. They also suggested systematically introducing the situation of Soviet women, women's activities in institutions, and childcare work.
