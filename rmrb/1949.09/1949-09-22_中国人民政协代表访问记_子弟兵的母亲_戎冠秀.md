　　A Visit with a Representative of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference
  　Mother of the Soldiers—Rong Guanxiu
    Lu Hao
    In the people's capital—Beiping, among the representatives of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, I met Rong Guanxiu again.
    The first time I met Rong Guanxiu was one morning in February 1944. It was right after the joint decision by the Party, government, military, and people of the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region to award her the title of "Model for Supporting the Army in the Northern Prison Area—Mother of the Soldiers." She was riding a chestnut mule given to her by the government, a bright red banner reading "Mother of the Soldiers" fluttering beside her. She had just returned from the heroes' meeting in the Border Region, on the rough and uneven mountain road of Wanzi River, in her hometown of Xiapan Song in Jianping County. The villagers crowded the streets to cheer her, and the children shouted along the way, "Glory is here! Glory is here!"
    Rong Guanxiu's great spirit of maternal love is a concentrated expression of the will of the people behind enemy lines to support the People's Liberation Army during the War of Resistance Against Japan. I remember it was during the fierce anti-"mopping-up" campaign in the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region in the winter of 1943. One evening, a seriously wounded soldier arrived at the village transportation station. His name was Feng Jianmin, his face was covered in blood, his eyes could not open, and his hair was matted into a bloody clump. Rong Guanxiu felt the wounded soldier's nostrils and was relieved to find he was still breathing. At that time, the village was constantly fighting guerrilla warfare, and everyone was exhausted. Rong Guanxiu hadn't closed her eyes for two nights and could doze off while standing. However, she went to the station several times, but the stretcher was still there. Everyone in the village was asleep, and no one could open their eyes anymore. Rong Guanxiu thought to herself, what if something happened to the wounded soldier? So, she found Bao Nv, the wife of Sheng Shengzi, to keep her company with a lamp. The lamplight flickered, the northwest wind rustled, and the Wanzi River was frozen solid. Rong Guanxiu squatted beside the stretcher and called out several times to the comrade, but the wounded soldier remained silent. She didn't know what to do, so she prepared half a bowl of boiled water, blew on it for a long time, tasted it and blew on it again, blowing and tasting. When the water was no longer hot, she used chopsticks to pry open the wounded soldier's mouth, but his teeth were clenched tightly, and all the water she poured in flowed down his neck. After a while, Rong Guanxiu helped him up and poured more water, which he swallowed. After drinking half a bowl of water, Rong Guanxiu asked the wounded soldier, "Do you want more?" In the lamplight, she saw the wounded soldier move his lips, and Rong Guanxiu was truly happy. Then, she gave him a bowl of noodles she had received during "Canmang," and he wanted more after finishing it. She asked, "Do you want a cornbread?" The wounded soldier said, "Good old friend, I just want a piece of cornbread." Rong Guanxiu heated up a cornbread for the wounded soldier. By then, it was already dawn, and she saw the wounded soldier's bare feet, which were frozen black and swollen. She went home to find cotton, but couldn't find any, so she tore off the front of her daughter's jacket and wrapped it around the wounded soldier's feet. She also served the wounded soldier three bowls of paste, and this time the wounded soldier could hold the bowl himself. Later, the stretcher bearers came, and she thickly padded the stretcher with straw, waiting until the wounded soldier was safely lying down before repeatedly urging the militiamen to take good care of him. As the militiamen carried the stretcher away, they heard the wounded soldier saying, "Good people! Good people! I will never forget your kindness!" Rong Guanxiu said to the wounded soldier, "This is Xiapan Song. Next time you pass by here, be sure to come to my house to rest. My name is Rong Guanxiu, and I am the director of the village women's association. If you can't remember my name, just ask where the old chairman lives, and even a three-year-old child will point you the way." As the stretcher moved away, they could still hear the wounded soldier's voice: "Good old people! Good old people!..."
    Rong Guanxiu is fifty-three years old this year, and she loves the People's Liberation Army as if they were her own family. Don't think she just cooks and works at home; she is always thinking about the front lines. She understands very well who the People's Liberation Army is risking their lives and shedding blood for. When the village was making military shoes, she said to the women, "The People's Liberation Army is climbing mountains and ridges; if the shoes are not sturdy, how can they fight?" The women of Xiapan Song made shoes as if they were making them for their own children and brothers. When delivering public grain, she went from one millstone to another, saying everywhere, "Grind the rice three times, remove the sand, and winnow the grain twice more to remove the chaff. The army is fighting at the front and doesn't have time to clean it; it's unsanitary to eat." Rong Guanxiu loves the People's Liberation Army, and not only that, but for the cause of the people's liberation, she has also dedicated her own children to the motherland. She once sent her son Lan Jin to the front lines, and her daughter Rong Hua now works in the Huolu District government.
    This time when I met Rong Guanxiu again, she told me that her Lan Jin had won merit in the war this spring. The good news of his merit arrived in his hometown from the distant front lines, which made the whole family extremely happy. Rong Guanxiu smiled and said with full confidence, "My boy is determined to make revolution, and there will be even greater good news to come." Her whole family was so excited that they didn't sleep all night when she came to Beiping as a specially invited representative of the CPPCC. The people in her family had all agreed in advance that she should tell them about the meeting and what Beijing City looks like when she came back. Everyone in the village happily said, "The old chairman will be able to see Chairman Mao this time!" When she left home to come to Beiping, she was still wearing a coarse white top and blue pants, and she still had a thimble on her right finger. She was still doing needlework when she was resting. The special commissioner had given her a suit of black broadcloth clothes when she left, and the people who brought her to Beiping asked her to change her clothes. She said, "I come from the peasants, so I will keep our old ways. I don't need to change." These days, many people have asked Rong Guanxiu what she is thinking. She said, "If it weren't for Chairman Mao's leadership, how could we have come to Beiping, how could we have come to this meeting? This is a great liberation for us workers and peasants!"

　　中国人民政协代表访问记
  　子弟兵的母亲—戎冠秀
    陆灏
    在人民的首都——北平，在人民政治协商会议的代表中，我又见到了戎冠秀。
    我第一次见到戎冠秀，是在一九四四年二月的一个早晨。那正是当时晋察冀边区党政军民联合决定赠于她“北狱区拥军模范——子弟兵的母亲”称号之后，她骑着一匹政府奖给她的栗色大骡，身边飘着一面鲜红的“子弟兵的母亲”的锦旗，刚开完群英大会从边区回来，在崎岖不平的湾子河的山道上，在她的建屏县下盘松的故乡，乡亲们拥挤在街头对她欢呼，孩子们沿路嚷着：“光荣来了！光荣来了！”
    戎冠秀伟大的母爱精神，是抗战时期敌后人民拥护解放军意志的集中表现。记得是一九四三年冬天晋察冀反“扫荡”战争进行正激烈之际，一个黄昏，村里的交通站上来了个重伤员，名字叫封建民，血糊满了脸，眼也睁不开，头发被结成一个血疙瘩，戎冠秀摸了摸伤号的鼻孔还出气，心里才稍安定，那时村里整天打游击，谁都累倒了，戎冠秀也已两夜没有合眼，站着也能瞌睡，可是，她去站上好几次，担架还在那儿摆着，全村都睡了，谁也没法再睁眼，戎冠秀心一想，伤员要是闹个三长两短，这怎么办，于是，她找了生生子媳妇宝女和她点灯作伴。灯光一灭一闪，西北风哗啦哗啦，湾子河的冰冻得格格发响。戎冠秀蹲在担架边，连叫几声同志，伤员仍是不出声，她没有法子，弄了半碗开水，吹了老半天，尝尝吹吹，吹了又尝，等水不烫了，它拿筷子拨开伤员的嘴，但他牙关咬得很紧，灌下去的水全流在脖子里。呆了一会，戎冠秀把他扶起来，再灌水，水就咽下去了。喝完了半碗水，戎冠秀问伤员：“还喝吗？”灯光里，见伤员动了动嘴唇，戎冠秀可真喜欢。接着又喝了碗水，这水是戎冠秀吹凉了，伤员靠在戎冠秀身上自己喝下去的，喝完了，伤员说个“不喝了”就躺下了。过了一会，戎冠秀把“参忙”时得到的一碗面片，端给伤员吃，他吃完了还想吃。她问：“你吃玉米饼子吗？”伤员说：“好老乡，我就是想吃块饼子。”戎冠秀烤热了饼子给伤员，天已经明了，她又看见伤员那只冻得又黑又肿的光脚板，回到家里去找棉花，没找见，就撕了闺女的一个袄襟，给伤员包住了脚，又侍候伤员吃了三碗糊糊，这回伤员已经能自己端着碗吃了。后来，担架来了，她给厚厚的铺上谷草，直等伤员平安的躺下去了，还再三再四叮嘱民兵需小心照料他。民兵们把担架上了肩，只听见伤员在说：“好人啦！好人啦！我什么时候也忘不了你的好处呵！”戎冠秀对伤员说：“这是下盘松，下次走过这里，千万到我家里歇，我叫戎冠秀，是本村妇救会主任，你记不清我的名字，只要问老会长住在那里，三岁的孩儿也会指点给你的。”担架走远了，还听见伤员的声音：“好老人啦！好老人啦！……”
    戎冠秀今年五十三岁，她疼爱解放军如同家人。别看她平时家里烧饭做活，她心里可惦记前线，她非常明白解放军在枪林弹雨中拼命流血为了谁？村里做军鞋，她给女人们说：“解放军爬山过岭，鞋不结实，怎么打仗？”下盘松妇女做鞋，都象给自己孩子和兄弟们做的一样。交公粮时，她从这个碾盘走到那个碾盘，她到处说：“要推三糙米，砂子要检掉，粮食要多簸两遍，不留糠，军队在前方打仗，顾不得淘，吃了不卫生。”戎冠秀爱解放军，不但如此，为了人民解放事业，她并将自己的儿女供献给祖国。她曾把儿子蓝金送上前线，她的女儿荣花现在获鹿区政府工作。
    这次我又见到戎冠秀的时候，她告诉我她的蓝金今年春天，在战争中立了功，立功的喜报从遥远的前线来到了家乡，这使全家极为欢腾。戎冠秀笑着满怀着信心说：“我的小子坚决革命，还会有更大的喜报来。”她作为政协的特邀代表来到北平，全家兴奋得整夜不睡，家里的人都预先说好，要她回来时说说开会的情形，说说北京城的样儿，全村的人快乐的说：“老会长这次可以看到毛主席了！”她离开家来到北平，依然穿一件粗布的白上衣，蓝裤子，右手指上还带着顶针，休息的时候她还在做针线，她来的时候专署曾送给她一身黑洋布衣服，到了北平，送她来的人请她换衣裳，她说：“我从农民中来，还是咱们这老作风，不要换了。”这些天很多人问戎冠秀心里想些什么？她说：“要不是毛主席的领导，咱怎么能来到北平，怎么能来开这个会，这就是我们工人农民开天辟地的大翻身！”
