　　Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 5th—Over 100,000 citizens of Xi'an warmly celebrated the great victory of the liberation of Lanzhou on the 3rd. The meeting began solemnly amidst the military band playing victory marches and a twenty-four gun salute.賀龙(He Long), 习仲勋(Xi Zhongxun), 刘景范(Liu Jingfan), 贾拓夫(Jia Tuofu), 杨子廉(Yang Zilian), 赵伯平(Zhao Boping), 张经武(Zhang Jingwu), 方仲如(Fang Zhongru) and twenty-one others formed the presidium of the meeting. After Vice Mayor Zhang Fengbo, the chairman, reported on the significance of the meeting, Zhao Boping, Deputy Secretary of the CPC Xi'an Municipal Committee, delivered a speech. He said: The liberation of Lanzhou has provided extremely favorable conditions for the People's Liberation Army to continue advancing, liberate Qinghai, Ningxia, Xinjiang provinces, and Hanzhong, eliminate the remnants of the Hu Ma bandits, and completely liberate the Great Northwest, making the "hopes" of the American imperialists and the Kuomintang reactionaries placed on the Qing-Ning Ma bandits completely bankrupt. Today we can see the splendid prospects of building the Great Northwest. At the same time, the liberation of Lanzhou will create fully favorable conditions for the development of production and material exchange in both urban and rural areas of Shaanxi and Gansu provinces, which is especially beneficial to the development of industrial and commercial production in Xi'an. Subsequently, Zhang Jingwu, Chief of Staff of the Northwest Military Region, Fang Zhongru, Deputy Mayor of Xi'an Municipal People's Government, Yang Zilian, Secretary-General of the Northwest General Branch of the China Democratic League, and others spoke. After outlining the powerful strength of the First Field Army, Zhang Jingwu called on the entire military and civilians in the rear to abide by discipline and laws, improve work efficiency, practice strict economy, and save manpower and material resources to support the army's westward advance. Fang Zhongru called on the people of the city to support the westward advance of the army with practical actions, and first of all to do three things well: first, strive to restore and develop production; second, continue to eliminate bandits and special agents and consolidate the rear's security; third, oppose speculation and stabilize prices. Yang Zilian said in his speech: "The liberation of Lanzhou and many Hui areas has swept away the Ma bandits' instigation of ethnic conflicts between the Hui and Han peoples, as well as some rumors and slanders against the Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army. Facts have proved that the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army are the saviors who liberate the vast oppressed Hui compatriots." After the meeting, a torchlight procession with tens of thousands of torches and lanterns began, the whole city was brightly lit, and everyone turned out into the streets, dispersing only late at night.
