　　American Aggression Against China
    Liu Danian
  　　　　　III. Contending for Hegemony in China (Continued 19)
    The methods employed by the United States in implementing this policy of aggression were: firstly, to create pro-Japanese arguments domestically through government spokespersons to justify American non-interference. For example, the New York Tribune stated, "The Japanese military action is an unavoidable response to China's policy of abolishing unequal treaties," and the New York Daily News said, "Japan has inherited Russia's development in Manchuria, and its great achievements to this day are recognized by the world" ...etc. (Note: The Eastern Miscellany, Vol. 29, No. 1). Internationally, it refused cooperation with countries like Britain and France who requested joint intervention in Japan. On September 22nd, a proposal was put forward in Geneva that the League of Nations should send an investigation team to Manchuria, but the United States opposed it, saying that "such actions could stimulate the emotions of the Japanese people and put liberals in an unfavorable position." When Britain, through the League of Nations, made a resolution in October demanding that Japan withdraw from Manchuria by November 16th, U.S. Undersecretary of State Castle immediately stated on October 31st: "Under the treaty guaranteeing China's integrity, the United States has to oppose Japan's long-term occupation of Manchuria (?), but the United States did not endorse the League of Nations' request for Japan to withdraw from Manchuria by November 16th." (Note: The Eastern Miscellany, Vol. 28, No. 24. The book "Stimson's The Far Eastern Crisis," published in 1934, narrates how the United States was willing to cooperate with Britain during the September 18th Incident, but this was for other political purposes and is not credible). Thus, the US did not approve of Japan withdrawing from Northeast China. Later, in 1946, the secret documents published by the U.S. State Department also recorded that at the time, the U.S. wanted to "prevent international action against Japan from being too excessive" and "opposed the application of economic sanctions." In China, Chiang Kai-shek was instructed not to resist Japan. On November 27th, U.S. Ambassador to Japan, Forbes, read and left a memorandum to Japanese Foreign Minister Kijūrō Shidehara, which stated: "The government of this country... has advised the Chinese government to take a compromise step and recognize the proposal of the Executive Yuan (note: referring to the 'League of Nations' Executive Yuan) based in part on the Japanese government's proposal..." (Note: President Hoover's report to the Senate, see "The Truth About the Neutral Zone of Jinzhou" in The National News Weekly, Vol. 10, No. 37). This is ironclad proof that the United States instructed Chiang Kai-shek not to resist Japan at that time. Therefore, after Chiang Kai-shek repeatedly telegraphed Zhang Xueliang to "absolutely not resist in order to avoid expanding the incident," he also gave a speech at the Kuomintang Party Congress in Nanjing on September 22nd, saying: "At this moment, we must be united from top to bottom, first use reason against power, and use peace against barbarism, enduring humiliation and harboring resentment, temporarily adopting an attitude of patience, and waiting for the judgment of international justice" (Note: Wang Yunsheng: "These Two Years," same newspaper as above), thus expounding the non-resistance doctrine taught to him by the United States to the fullest extent.
    Since the true policy of the United States was such, on the surface it had to express an ambiguous attitude, and on September 25th, it sent notes to both Japan and Chiang Kai-shek's government, asking them to "peacefully resolve" the issue. It was not until November 26th, when Japanese representative to the "League of Nations," Yoshizawa Kenkichi, informed the United States that Japan was preparing to attack Jinzhou, and military action began on the 27th, that Stimson "expressed slight surprise" and believed that Japan "violated its promise" (Note: The Eastern Miscellany, Vol. 29, No. 3), thereby breaking the secret U.S.-Japan agreement. On the same day, he issued a warning to Japan, saying that the U.S. government was "very concerned about this" (Note: i.e., the memorandum cited earlier). Japan ignored it, so the United States, together with Britain and France, sent a relatively strong ultimatum to the Japanese government through Forbes on December 23rd. Japan's reply was "cannot comply." The Japanese army finally occupied Jinzhou on January 2nd, 1932, and the United States then issued a famous "non-recognition doctrine" note to China and Japan through Stimson on the 7th of the same month:
    "The recent military actions in the Jinzhou area have destroyed the last remaining administrative power of the Republic of China government in South Manchuria before September 18, 1931... The United States government has no intention of recognizing any treaties or agreements signed by the governments of China and Japan or their representatives that would undermine the rights of the United States or its people in China." (Note: Published in The National News Weekly, Vol. 9, No. 4).
    Obviously, this did not mean opposing Japan's occupation of Manchuria in violation of its established policy, but rather realizing its established policy of urging Japan to attack the Soviet Union and not to expand further south. This was explained more clearly in a supplementary declaration issued by the U.S. State Department the day after Stimson issued the above note: "(1) The United States has no intention of interfering with Japan's legitimate treaty rights in Manchuria; (2) It does not intend to interfere with any solutions to the incident by Japan, provided that this incident does not undermine American rights..." (Note: See above). This is the subtle and profound effect of the U.S. "non-recognition doctrine," and it is naturally a more typical example of the combination of American anti-Sovietism and aggression against China.
    When Japan did not strictly abide by the wishes of the United States and did not launch a large-scale offensive against the Soviet Union, but instead used anti-Sovietism as a pretext to expand southward, seriously threatening the Chiang Kai-shek regime and American interests, the United States, based on the approach taken during the "September 18th Incident," vigorously implemented a two-faced policy. On the one hand, after helping Japan obtain Manchuria as a base, it continued to make concessions in mainland China to implement the policy of encouraging Japan to oppose the Soviet Union, shifting the focus of its strength to directly suppressing the developing revolutionary movement in China. On the other hand, it imposed certain restrictions on Japan's expansion, putting on a posture of being actively against Japan, so as to prevent Japan from excessively hindering American interests, and striving for the United States to control mainland China alone. From 1931 to 1937, the U.S. policy in China was roughly like this. At the same time, since the United States firmly refused to cooperate with Britain at the beginning of the "September 18th Incident," forcing Britain to side with Japan, during this period, the United States had to place more emphasis on various struggles against Britain than in the past.

　　美国侵华史
    刘大年
  　　　　　三　争夺中国霸权　（续十九）
    美国执行这个侵略政策方法：首先在国内由政府发言机关制造袒日论调，作为美国不干涉的理由，如纽约论坛说：“日人军事行动为对于中国废除不平等条约政策所不能免之反响”，纽约日日新闻说：“日本继承俄国在满洲开发，至于今日，其功绩之伟大，为世人所公认”……等等（注：东方杂志二九卷一号。）在国际上则拒绝英法等国要求共同干涉日本的合作。九月二十二日，日内瓦方面提出建议，“国联”要派调查团前往满洲，美国加以反对，说“此种行动足以刺激日本国民的情绪，反使自由主义者陷于不利的地位”。英国于十月间通过“国联”作出一项要日本于十一月十六日以前退出满洲的决议时，美副国务卿凯塞尔于同月三十一日即表示：“美国在担保中国完整之条约下，不得不反对日本久占满洲（？），惟国联要求日本于十一月十六日以前退出满洲一举，美国并未附义。”（注：东方杂志二八卷二四号，一九三四年发表的史汀生远东之危机一书中叙述九一八时，美国如何愿意和英国合作，系另有政治目的，不足为据。）这样来不赞成日本从东北撤退。后来一九四六年，美国国务院发表的秘密文件，也记载着当时美国是要“阻止国际对日行动切勿操之过激”，且“反对施用经济制裁”。在中国则指使蒋介石不准对日本抵抗，十一月二十七日美驻日大使福白斯向日本外务大臣币原面读并留交的觉书中有这样的话：“本国政府……曾劝中国政府采取妥协步调，并承认以日本政府提案为部分的基础之行政院（按：指‘国联’行政院）提案……。”（注：胡佛总统向上院报告，转见国闻周报一○卷三七期，立晓所谓锦州中立区之真相一文。）这是美国当时曾指示蒋介石不准对日抵抗的铁的证明。所以蒋介石一再电张学良“为免事件扩大，绝对不抵抗”之后，又于九月二十二日在南京全市国民党员大会上演说：“此刻必须上下一致，先以公理对强权，以和平对野蛮，忍辱含愤，暂取逆来顺受态度，以待国际公理之判断”（注：王芸生：这两年，同上报。）云云，这是把美国教给他的不抵抗主义发挥得淋漓尽致。
    美国真实政策既如此，表面上只得表示一种模棱两可的态度，于九月二十五日照会日本及蒋政府，要他们“和平解决”。直至十一月二十六日，日本驻“国联”代表芳泽谦吉通知美国，日本准备进攻锦州，二十七日即开始军事行动，这时史汀生才“略表惊诧之意”，且认为日本“有违诺言”（注：东方杂志二九卷三号），破坏了美日秘约。同日，向日本发出一个劝告，说美政府“对此殊为关切”（注：即前文所引觉书）。日本不理会，美国乃联合英法于十二月二十三日由福白斯送一个比较强硬的通牒给日本政府。日本的答复是“断不能遵从”。日军卒于一九三二年一月二日占领锦州，美国始由史汀生于同月七日向中日两国发出一个有名的“不承认主义”照会：
    “最近锦州方面之军事行动，业将一九三一年九月十八日以前中华民国政府在南满最后存留之行政权，破坏无遗……凡中日两国政府或其代表所订之任何条约或协定，足以损及美国或其人民在华之权利……美国政府均无意承认。”（注：载国闻周报，九卷四期。）
    显然，这个意思不是违反它的既定政策来反对日本占据满洲，而是要实现它的既定政策催促日本去进攻苏联，且不要再往南发展，这在史汀生发出上项照会的第二天，美国务院另外发表的一个补充宣言解释得更清楚：“（一）美国丝毫无意干涉日本在满洲合法条约权利，（二）不拟过问日本任何解决事件，惟此项事件，不得破坏美国权利……。”（注：见同上。）这就是美国“不承认主义”的精微奥妙作用，自然是美国反苏与侵略中国结合更典型的例子。
    当此后日本并没有恪遵美国愿望，去怎样大举进攻苏联，反而以反苏为借口，大举向南扩张，蒋介石政权及美国利益受到严重威胁时，美国便以对待“九一八”的方法为基础，大肆施展两面政策，即一面于帮助日本取得满洲作根据地之后，又在中国内地继续让步，以贯彻鼓励日本反苏的方针，把自己力量重点转向于直接镇压中国正在发展的革命运动上；另一面，则对日本扩张加以某些限制，装出一些积极对日的资态，使日本不致过分妨害美国利益，争取美国单独控制中国内地。从一九三一到三七年，美国在中国的政策都大致如此。同时，由于“九一八”开始时，美国坚决不与英国合作，把英国逼向了日本一边，在这个时期内，美国又须比已往着重对英国进行各种斗争。
