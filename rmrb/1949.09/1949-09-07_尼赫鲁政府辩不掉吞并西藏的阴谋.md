The Nehru Government Cannot Deny the Conspiracy to Annex Tibet
He Sijing

The Tibetan authorities, under the pretext of "Communist elements engaging in sabotage," expelled Han Chinese, Han Chinese lamas, and Kuomintang representatives stationed in Tibet on July 8th, and closed Han Chinese schools. This is undoubtedly an exposure of an international conspiracy. Why does the Nehru government's news agency publicly announce that "Tibet has never recognized China's sovereignty" (July 27th) after the Tibetan authorities expelled the Han Chinese? Moreover, on the same day, a "British authority" brazenly claimed: "Britain has never recognized China's claim that Tibet is part of China and under Chinese jurisdiction," and "if China attempts to impose its rule on Tibet, Tibet can seek British intervention." It is clear that the "British authority" admitted to the Associated Press reporter that the background of this Tibetan incident involves not only the Nehru government but also British imperialism. Is there any doubt about this? This background includes not only British reactionaries but also American imperialism. American imperialism had already sent two Strategic Intelligence Bureau (spies) agents to Tibet during the War of Resistance under the guise of finding a transportation route from India to China, and sent a so-called "goodwill mission" to Lhasa to establish "friendly relations." It also encouraged Tibet to send people to the United States without going through the Kuomintang government to collude, and established a Tibetan Culture Department at Yale University to prepare for the invasion of Tibet. Has American imperialism's long-planned ambition not gained a small satisfaction in this Tibetan incident? Doesn't the Nehru government's news agency's claim that "due to the recent developments in China, the Tibetan authorities fear that the establishment of an office by the Kuomintang in Lhasa will lead to Communist aggression in Tibet" represent the mentality of the American imperialists? It is precisely the American imperialists who want to find anti-communist forces other than the Kuomintang everywhere in China. The Nehru government's news agency is admitting that it is the real executor of the American policy: the direct instigator and perpetrator of the American anti-communist policy. The Delhi Flash reported: "Britain and the United States have turned India into a tool to realize their ambitions in Tibet," which is absolutely correct.

However, the Nehru government needs to deny the arson plan. An Associated Press dispatch from New Delhi on the 3rd stated that "An Indian government spokesman said on Saturday that the Chinese Communist Party's allegation that India plans to annex Tibet is completely groundless."

The Chinese Communist Party will never accuse others of their intentions and actions without evidence. To distinguish responsibilities, we do not agree with the Anglo-American imperialists simply equating Nehru with India. India's Nehru is like China's Chiang Kai-shek, which is a misfortune for a nation. India will inevitably be the India of the Indian people, but today we understand that the term "India" or "Indian government" used by the Anglo-American imperialists and Nehru refers to the rule of Nehru, the Anglo-American lackey, and the Indian reactionaries, not to the Indian people, nor to the people's India.

The Nehru government spokesman said that the CCP's statement that they plan to annex Tibet is completely groundless. Okay, let's examine whether this is "completely groundless."

The Indian News Agency, the same mouthpiece of the Nehru government, publicly announced on July 27th that "Tibet has never recognized China's sovereignty." That shouldn't be completely groundless, right? Let's not ask what legal responsibility the Nehru government bears for such a public announcement, nor what background it relies on, what forces and laws it relies on for such a bold announcement. Let's first look at the subtle aspects of such a public announcement.

The Nehru government announced that "Tibet has never recognized China's sovereignty," hoping for an effect: to pretend to be the liberator of Tibet in front of a group of ignorant people. This announcement has many benefits for him. First, the Nehru government really looks like the government of a newly "independent" country, full of vigor. Secondly, he thought that the Chinese Communist Party advocates the principles of national equality and the fullest autonomy for all ethnic groups within the country, and it seems that it would give up its responsibility and not liberate the Tibetan people. Then, would the "sovereignty" over Tibet fall into the hands of any government other than Nehru? Wouldn't that cunning plan lead to such a public announcement that "Tibet has never recognized China's sovereignty"? No wonder the Anglo-American imperialists and their lackeys want to push Nehru out as the head of the anti-communist alliances in East Asia. No wonder the American imperialists want to ask the United Nations to elect the Nehru government to participate in the Security Council.

Now, let's see! The Nehru government publicly announced that "Tibet has never recognized China's sovereignty," which is not "completely groundless." Then, in the logic of facts, the "sovereignty over Tibet" will naturally and inevitably fall into Nehru's pocket. Can it still be said that the Chinese Communist Party's accusation that the Nehru government "plans to annex Tibet is completely groundless"?

Of course, the Nehru government's denial of "planning to annex Tibet" also has a one-sided logic to use as a tool for its sophistry. It can say: Announcing that "Tibet has never recognized China's sovereignty" does not equal announcing that Tibet recognizes another country's sovereignty. Yes, the proposition "Tibet has never recognized China's sovereignty" has two logics, which can be summarized as: 1. It does not equal Tibet recognizing another country's sovereignty, and at the same time, 2. It equals Tibet (secretly) recognizing another country's sovereignty. One of the two must be true. Only facts can determine and prove which one the Nehru government and the Tibetan reactionaries will ultimately take. The Nehru government has adopted the former in its public statements, which is beneficial to it and can help it cover up or deny its sinful acts, but in actual practice, it will inevitably adopt the conclusion of the latter logic. The Nehru government cannot deny that it has already sent people to Lhasa. And there are other facts that can be predicted that the Nehru government will inevitably take the same path towards Tibet. This fact is what the New York Times dispatch from New Delhi on August 8th said: "An Indian Foreign Ministry spokesman stated tonight that Bhutan has become a protectorate of India." In other words, Nehru already has sovereignty over Bhutan. Since it has already asserted its sovereignty over Bhutan, after announcing that Tibet has never recognized China's sovereignty, will it not certainly announce its own sovereignty over Tibet?

Sovereignty is a dark vassal state system, a protectorate system, a pseudonym for foreign oppression and enslavement, an official and illusory term. The Communist Party opposes all these systems of foreign oppression and enslavement, and all their official and traditional names. All this has no place or rights not only in the face of the Communist Party and the revolutionary people, but also in the UN Charter and all international legal documents approved by the revolutionary people after the Second World War. The Nehru government has no right to legally declare a country its protectorate. Since the Nehru government has declared Bhutan its protectorate, it should be subject to UN scrutiny and is not qualified to participate in the Security Council.

Moreover, Nehru and his ilk, in the name of a foreign government, announce that "Tibet has never recognized China's sovereignty." This is a blatant provocation of the feelings of the Chinese nationalities, undermining the unity of the Chinese nationalities, and a serious illegal act of blatant interference in China's internal affairs. Today, even the UN Charter states that "Nothing contained in the present Charter shall authorize the United Nations to intervene in matters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any state." The Nehru government and the "British authority" should be questioned: According to what shady international conference or convention do you carry out acts to undermine the unity of the Chinese nationalities and blatantly interfere in China's internal affairs? You will be held seriously responsible for these illegal acts. Don't think that you can escape the sanctions of the people by setting fires everywhere. The peaceful power and peaceful organizations of the people are becoming stronger day by day. You, a group of peace threats and destroyers, will be everywhere encountered by the people who will treat you as criminals caught in the act and sanction you.

The Tibet issue is not a question that you, a group of peace destroyers, have the right to meddle in, but an internal issue of China. This kind of issue has already been subject to a principled rule in the program of the CCP and Chairman Mao, and the Chinese Communists are tirelessly implementing this program, a program for the common efforts of the Chinese nationalities for their own liberation. In On Coalition Government, Chairman Mao criticized and opposed all the reactionary acts of the past, including the Kuomintang reactionaries, who referred to the ethnic minorities as clans and advocated, explicitly or implicitly, sovereignty over the ethnic minorities. Chairman Mao called on the Communists to actively help "the broad masses of all ethnic minorities, including all leaders who are connected with the masses, to strive for their liberation and development in politics, economy, and culture, and to establish their own armies of ethnic minorities that support the interests of the people. Their languages, customs, habits, and religious beliefs should be respected." Chairman Mao fully agreed with Mr. Sun Yat-sen's ethnic policy, which is "first, the Chinese nation seeks its own liberation, and second, all ethnic groups within China are equal," and "after the victory of the war against imperialism and warlords, a free and unified (a free union of all ethnic groups) Republic of China should be organized." Therefore, Chairman Mao also mentioned in On Coalition Government that "All ethnic groups within China should, based on the principles of voluntariness and democracy (but not the voluntariness and democracy in the brackets of a few people), organize a Federation of the Democratic Republic of China, and on the basis of this federation, organize the central government of the federation." In this program of a united big family of New Democratic nationalities, please Nehru and his ilk see clearly, what "Chinese sovereignty" is there that needs you to deny it in the name of a foreign government? And please, "British authority," see, what "attempt to impose its rule on Tibet" requires you to encourage Tibet and the reactionaries to "seek British intervention"?

However, you always have to find some excuses to carry out your outdated activities. At the same time, you should remember that you will one day know that you are failing men.

　　尼赫鲁政府辩不掉吞并西藏的阴谋
    何思敬
    七月八日西藏当局以“共产党分子有捣乱行动”为口实驱逐了汉人、汉人喇嘛、国民党驻藏办事人，封闭了汉人学校，这无疑是一个国际阴谋底暴露。为什么西藏当局驱逐汉人的事变竟需要印度尼赫鲁政府机关通讯社来公然宣布“西藏从未承认中国的宗主权”（七月二十七日）呢？不仅如此，而且同一天竟有一位“英国权威人士”出来妄称：“英国从未承认中国所说的西藏是中国的一部分并受中国统辖的讲法”，“如果中国有强加其统治于西藏的企图，西藏即可觅取英国的干涉。”明明“英国权威人士”向合众社记者供认了这次西藏事变底背景不仅是尼赫鲁政府，而且是英帝国主义，还有什么疑问吗？这背景不仅有英国反动派，还有美帝国主义。美帝国主义早已在抗战中借口寻找由印度运物资到中国的运输线而派了战略情报局局员（特务）二人驻在西藏，并派了所谓“亲善访问团”赴拉萨建立“亲善关系”，也鼓励西藏不经过国民党政府派人到美国去勾搭，又在耶鲁大学设立了西藏文化科，作侵略西藏的准备。美帝国主义底处心积虑的野心，难道还没有在这次西藏事变中获得了小小的满足吗？尼赫鲁政府通讯社所称“由于中国最近局势的发展，西藏当局深恐国民党在拉萨设立办事处而引起共产党的侵略活动入西藏”，岂不是正代表着美帝国主义者们底心理吗？正是美帝国主义者们想在中国到处找国民党以外的反共势力，尼赫鲁政府通讯社正招认了美帝政策底实在的执行者：美帝反共政策底直接教唆犯与下手人。德里闪电报说：“英美已把印度变成实现它们对西藏的野心的工具”，一点也不差。
    然而尼赫鲁政府需要否认放火计划。合众社新德里三日电告“印度政府发言人星期六称：中国共产党指称印度计划吞并西藏一节，全属无稽”。
    中国共产党决不无凭无据地指责他人底企图与行为。为了分别责任，我们不同意英美帝国主义者随便把尼赫鲁和印度混为一谈。印度之有尼赫鲁，正如中国之曾有蒋介石，这都是一个民族底不幸。印度必然将是印度人民底印度，但今天我们了解，英美帝国主义者及尼赫鲁等所谓印度或印度政府，乃指英美走狗尼赫鲁底统治和印度反动派而言，不是指印度人民，也不是指人民的印度。
    尼赫鲁政府发言人说，中共说他们计划吞并西藏一节，全属无稽。好吧，研究一下，是不是“全属无稽”之谈。
    同一个尼赫鲁政府底发言机关印度新闻社，曾于七月二十七日公然宣布，“西藏从未承认中国的宗主权”，这该不是全属无稽吧。暂且不问尼赫鲁政府这样公然的宣布在法律上负什么责任，也暂且不问尼赫鲁政府这样大胆的宣布有什么背景，依仗什么势力与法律，先看看这样公然的宣布底巧妙的方面吧。
    尼赫鲁政府宣布“西藏从未承认中国的宗主权”，期望着一个效果，就是：在一批无知者面前，装出西藏解放者底洋相来。这样宣布对他有许多好处，第一，尼赫鲁政府真有点象刚刚“独立”的国家底政府，有朝气。其次，他以为中国共产党主张民族平等、国内诸民族最充分的自治等原则，似乎就会放弃责任，而不去解放西藏人民。那末，对西藏的“宗主权”还会落到尼赫鲁以外的政府手里去吗？不是这个妙计，会那样公然宣布“西藏从未承认中国的宗主权”吗？难怪英美帝国主义者及其走狗们都要推尼赫鲁出来充当东亚反共的诸同盟底头子，难怪美帝国主义者要提请联合国选举尼赫鲁政府参加安理会了。
    现在看吧！尼赫鲁政府公然宣布“西藏从未承认中国的宗主权”，既不是“全属无稽”，那末，“对西藏的宗主权”在事实底逻辑上会自然又必然地落到尼赫鲁政府底袋里去，这还能说中国共产党指称尼赫鲁政府“计划吞并西藏一节，全属无稽”吗？
    当然，尼赫鲁政府之否认“计划吞并西藏”还有片面的逻辑做它诡辩底工具。它可以说：宣布“西藏从未承认中国的宗主权”，不就等于宣布西藏承认另一国的宗主权。是啊，“西藏从未承认中国的宗主权”这个命题是有两个逻辑的，归结就是：一、不等于西藏承认另一国的宗主权，同时，二、等于西藏（暗中）承认另一国的宗主权。二者必居其一。只有事实可以决定并证明尼赫鲁政府与西藏反动派毕竟采取那一个。尼赫鲁政府在公开发言中采取了前一个，这对它有利，可以帮助它掩盖或否认它底罪恶行为，但在实际作为中它势必采取后一个逻辑的归结。尼赫鲁政府总不能否认已经派人到拉萨去。而且还有其他事实可以预料尼赫鲁政府对西藏必将采取同一条道路。这事实就是纽约时报新德里八月八日电所说：“印度外交部发言人，今晚说明不丹已成为印度底保护国。”换言之，尼赫鲁对不丹已有了宗主权。既然对不丹已经主张了自己底宗主权，那末，在宣布了西藏从未承认中国的宗主权之后，还不会肯定宣布自己底宗主权对于西藏吗？
    宗主权就是黑暗的附庸国制度，保护国制度，异族的压迫与奴役底别名，官用的玄幻的名称。共产党反对这一切异族的压迫与奴役底制度，及其一切官用的传统的名称。这一切不仅在共产党和革命的人民面前没有地位与权利，即在联合国宪章以及第二次大战以后一切被革命人民所批准的国际法文献中没有地位与权利。尼赫鲁政府没有任何权利可以合法地宣布一个国家为其保护国。尼赫鲁政府既宣布了不丹为其保护国，就该受联合国底审查，并且没有资格参加安理会。
    而且尼赫鲁之流以一个外国政府底名义，来宣布“西藏从未承认中国的宗主权”，这是公然挑拨中国诸民族底感情，破坏中国诸民族团结，公然干涉中国内政的严重不法行为，今天连联合国宪章都载明“不得认为授权联合国干涉在本质上属于任何国家内管辖之事件”，应当质问尼赫鲁政府以及“英国权威人士”，你们根据什么不见天日的国际会议或公约来进行破坏中国诸民族底团结，公然干涉中国内政？你们底这种不法行为，要负严重的责任。不要以为你们到处放火，可以不受人民底制裁，人民底和平威力与和平组织一天强大一天，你们这批和平底威胁者与破坏者，将到处遇到人民把你们当作现行犯来制裁。
    西藏问题不是你们这批和平破坏者有权容喙的问题，而是中国底内部问题，这种问题早已在中共以及毛主席底纲领中有了原则规定，并且中国共产党人不疲倦地正在执行这个纲领，中国诸民族为自己底解放而共同努力的纲领。毛主席在论联合政府中，曾批评并反对过去一切反动派，连国民党反动派在内，称各少数民族为宗族而明中或暗中对各少数民族主张宗主权的反动行为。毛主席号召共产党人积极地帮助“各少数民族的广大人民群众，包括一切联系民众的领袖在内，争取他们在政治上、经济上、文化上的解放与发展，并成立拥护民众利益的少数民族自己的军队，他们的言语文字、风俗、习惯及宗教信仰应被尊重”。毛主席完全同意孙中山先生底民族政策，即“一则中国民族自求解放，二则中国境内各民族一律平等”，并“于反对帝国主义及军阀之战争获得胜利以后，当组织一自由统一的（各民族自由联合的）中华民国”。所以毛主席在论联合政府中也提到“中国境内各民族应根据自愿与民主的原则（但不是少数人底括弧里的自愿与民主），组织中华民主共和国联邦，并在这个联邦基础上组织联邦的中央政府”。在这个新民主主义的诸民族团结的大家庭底纲领中，请尼赫鲁之流看看清楚，有什么“中国的宗主权”需要你们用一个外国政府底名义来否认？也请“英国权威人士”看看，有什么“强加其统治于西藏的企图”需要你们鼓励西藏及反动派来“觅取英国的干涉”呢？
    不过，你们总要找一些口实来进行你们底过时的活动的，同时，你们应当记得你们总有一天会知道你们是没落的家伙。
