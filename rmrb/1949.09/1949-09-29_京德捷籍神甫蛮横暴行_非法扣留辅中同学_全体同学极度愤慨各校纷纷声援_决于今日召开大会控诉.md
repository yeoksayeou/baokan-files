Beijing News: Just as people across the country are preparing to warmly celebrate the founding of the People's Republic of China and the Central People's Government, five people in Beijing, Czech priest Zeng Dewang and German priests Ji Futai, Zhong Panshi, Guan Demei, and Long Ade, illegally detained six students from the Furen Middle School for Boys, He Cong, Zhang Huisheng, Liu Dejiang, Song Baozhang, Liu Zongyi, and Cheng Junmin, for up to half an hour. They also falsely accused the students of stealing their door lock.

The facts of the matter are as follows: At 1 PM on September 25th, the "Preparatory Committee for Celebrating the People's Republic of China" of Furen Middle School for Boys sent six students, including He Cong, to the courtyard of the Prince Gong Mansion (the school clinic of Fuzhong) to break off cypress branches to decorate the archway in front of the school gate. When the six students walked to the west gate (the main gate of the Priests' College), they were stopped by the acting dean of the college, German priest Long Ade. The students explained that they were there to break off branches, and Long said they were only allowed to enter from the north gate. The six students detoured to the north gate and broke off cypress branches at the rockery in the west courtyard. At this time, Czech priest Zeng Dewang and German priest Ji Futai arrived and claimed that the spring lock on the west courtyard gate was lost, insisting that the students "consider" and "take responsibility." The students explained that there were two gates leading to the west courtyard, one of which was not locked, and the students had entered through the north gate. After Zeng and Ji spoke a few words in a foreign language, they left immediately. Then Long Ade came and also claimed that the lock was lost. The six students then carried the cypress branches, preparing to return the way they came. At this time, Ji Futai stood in the middle of the road with an extremely ferocious posture, with a contemptuous expression on his face. When the students reached the north gate, they found that the north gate had been locked and they could not get out. They immediately asked the gatekeeper Sun Degui, who said: This was ordered by priest Zeng. Student He Cong questioned Czech priest Zeng Dewang as to why he had locked the door, and he replied that something was lost in the garden and "should be checked." His attitude was extremely rude, and after saying this, he hurriedly left. At this time, German priest Guan Demei ran over and pointed at the six students, saying: "I know all of you, none of you can escape." The students of the Fuzhong Celebration Committee, seeing that He Cong and the other six students had not returned for a long time, sent Yu Rulin (Fuzhong Chinese teacher), the head of the Celebration Committee's Propaganda Department, and student Liang @ to investigate. They found that the gate of the college was locked. After knocking for a long time, German priest Zhong Panshi ordered the worker to open the door. By this time, the six students had been locked in the courtyard for as long as thirty minutes.

After this illegal incident of the German and Czech priests detaining students and falsely accusing students of stealing the lock occurred, the teachers and students of Furen Middle School for Boys and Girls and Furen University were extremely angry and protested against this imperialist behavior, believing that it was not only an insult to the students of Furen, but also a provocation to the Chinese people. The Chinese people have stood up, and this illegal act of oppressing the Chinese people is absolutely not allowed. The students of the school are preparing to file a lawsuit with the People's Court, demanding that it be dealt with according to the law.

【Another News】The students of Fuda Middle School for Boys expressed extreme anger at the illegal detention of students by German and Czech priests, and called for a lawsuit to be filed with the People's Court. They decided to hold a "Furen Middle School for Boys Accusation of Prince Gong Mansion Atrocities Conference" at 2 PM today (29th) in the auditorium of Furen University.

When the Furen Middle School for Boys Student Union reported this incident to the university, girls' middle school and boys' middle school students, every student was enraged. They believe that under the rule of the Kuomintang in the past, it was common for imperialists to arbitrarily humiliate the Chinese people, but now that they are liberated, the Chinese people have stood up, and the Chinese people will never allow any imperialist elements to engage in such illegal activities on Chinese territory. The students unanimously demanded that the handling of this incident be discussed at today's afternoon accusation meeting.

The faculty, students, and workers of Fuda Middle School for Girls issued a letter of support to the boys' middle school yesterday morning. The students of Huabei University also issued a letter of support to Furen Middle School for Boys yesterday afternoon. Students from the University of Political Science and Law sent people to Fuzhong to comfort the detained students.

　　京德捷籍神甫蛮横暴行
  　非法扣留辅中同学
    全体同学极度愤慨各校纷纷声援
  　决于今日召开大会控诉
    【北京讯】正当全国各地人民准备热烈庆祝中华人民共和国、中央人民政府成立的时候，居然在北京的捷克籍神甫曾德望、德籍神甫纪福泰、仲盘石、关德美、龙阿德等五人，竟非法扣留辅仁男附中学生何琮、张惠生、柳德江、宋宝璋、刘宗义、程俊民等六人达半小时之久。并诬蔑学生偷了他们的门锁。
    事实的经过是这样的：本月二十五日下午一时，辅仁男附中“庆祝中华人民共和国筹委会”因扎搭校门前之牌楼，派何琮等六同学到恭王府（辅中校医处）院内折取柏树枝。当六位同学走到西门（司铎书院大门）时，被该院代理院长德籍神甫龙阿德拦阻，同学说明来折树枝，龙即称只许自北门进去。六同学绕道进入北门，到西院内假山折取柏树枝。这时捷籍神甫曾德望与德籍神甫纪福泰二人赶到，口称西院园门之弹簧锁遗失，硬要同学“考虑”并“负责”。同学说明通西院之门共有两道，其中之一并未加锁，同学系由北门入内。曾、纪二人说了几句外国话后，当即离去。随后龙阿德来了，亦称该锁遗失。六同学随即携抱柏枝准备循原路返回，这时纪福泰以异常凶恶的姿态叉腰站在路中，脸上显出鄙夷不屑的神气。同学行至北门，发现北门已被上锁，无法外出，当即询问号房工友孙德贵，孙工友说：这是曾神甫命令锁上的。何琮同学即质问捷籍神甫曾德望何以将门上锁，他回答说，园内丢了东西，“应该检查检查”。态度极为蛮横，说罢即匆匆离去。这时德籍神甫关德美跑来用手指着六位同学说：“我都认识你们，你们一个也跑不了。”辅中庆委会的同学们因何琮等六同学很久不回，遂由庆委会宣传部负责人俞汝霖（辅中国文教员）偕同学梁＠前往探看，发现该院门被锁闭，敲了许久，德籍神甫仲盘石才命令工友开门，至此时六位同学被锁在院内已达三十分钟之久。
    这一德捷籍神甫扣留学生及诬蔑同学盗锁的非法事件发生后，辅仁男女附中及辅大师生极为愤怒，纷纷抗议这种帝国主义的行为，认为这不仅是对辅仁同学的侮辱，而且是对中国人民的挑衅。中国人民已站起来了，这种非法欺压中国人民的行为是绝对不能容许的，该校学生正准备向人民法院起诉，要求依法处理。
    【又讯】辅大男附中的同学对于德捷籍神甫非法扣留同学事件，表示了极大的愤怒，纷纷提出必须向人民法院起诉，并决定于今（二十九）日下午二时假辅仁大学礼堂召开“辅仁男中控诉恭王府暴行事件大会”。
    当辅仁男中学生会将此事件报告给大学部、女中及男中同学时，每一个同学全激怒起来，认为过去国民党统治下，帝国主义任意凌辱中国人是屡见不鲜的，但是现在解放了，中国人民已经站立起来了，中国人民绝不允许任何帝国主义分子在中国领土上有这种非法行为发生，同学们并一致要求在今天下午控诉会上讨论对此次事件的处理办法。
    辅大女附中的教职员、同学、工友于昨晨发出致男中声援信，华大的同学昨日下午也发出致辅仁男中的声援信。政法大学同学并派人到辅中慰问被扣同学。
