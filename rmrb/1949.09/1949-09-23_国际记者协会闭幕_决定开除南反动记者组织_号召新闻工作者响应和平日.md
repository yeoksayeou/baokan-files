　　Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 20th -- The Executive Committee meeting of the International Organization of Journalists (IOJ), after lasting for three days, concluded successfully on the 17th in an atmosphere of unity. After heated discussions, it was unanimously decided that the Third Congress of Representatives would be held in Brussels, Belgium, from December 5th to 7th this year. The agenda of the Congress is as follows: (1) The Secretary-General's report on association affairs; (2) A report on newspapers and journalists fighting for peace (to be prepared by the French Journalists' Organization); (3) The living conditions of journalists (to be prepared by the Belgian Journalists' Organization); (4) Discussion; (5) The organizational regulations of the International Organization of Journalists; (6) Re-election of the leadership; (7) The time and place of the next Congress and other matters.

　　The other 20 resolutions unanimously passed by the Executive Committee, in addition to the previously reported acceptance of journalists' organizations from China, Albania, Free Greece, and East Germany to join the International Organization of Journalists, also included (1) Approving the Secretary-General Hronek's report on past work and thanking the Secretariat for its efforts; (2) Issuing a declaration calling on world journalists to respond to the struggle for the Day of Peace; (3) Noting that the American Newspaper Guild has not paid its membership dues for two years, effectively removing itself from the ranks of the International Organization of Journalists. Therefore, the Executive Committee decided not to discuss the proposals made by the Guild's chairman regarding the agenda of the Third Congress, and the Guild has no voting rights at the Congress; (4) The Yugoslav Journalists' Organization is assisting the Tito-Ranković fascist clique in persecuting progressive journalists, fundamentally violating the aims of the IOJ, and it is proposed that the Third Congress expel it; (5) Protesting the Austrian government's destruction of progressive journalism and expressing solidarity with democratic journalists in Greece and Spain; (6) Closely cooperating with the World Federation of Trade Unions, the Women's International Democratic Federation, the World Federation of Democratic Youth, and the World Peace Congress; (7) Preparing to hold an exhibition on world journalists fighting for peace during the Third Congress, publishing a Russian-French-English journal (monthly), and inviting world-renowned progressive journalists (whether or not they are members of IOJ member organizations) to attend the Congress as observers; (8) Sending letters to Czechoslovak President Gottwald, Minister of Propaganda Kopecky, and the Czechoslovak Union of Journalists, thanking them for their enthusiastic assistance to the IOJ Secretariat located in Prague over the past two years.

　　In his closing remarks, Chairman Eugene pointed out that the resolutions passed by this Executive Committee meeting, which are of great importance, are a manifestation of the intensified unity of the world's democratic journalists and a response to the reactionary leaders of American and British journalists' organizations' divisive conspiracies. Eugene once again specifically welcomed the Chinese Journalists Association, with its 10,000 members, to join the International Organization of Journalists. He emphatically pointed out that the revolutionary struggle of nearly 500 million Chinese people is about to achieve complete victory.
