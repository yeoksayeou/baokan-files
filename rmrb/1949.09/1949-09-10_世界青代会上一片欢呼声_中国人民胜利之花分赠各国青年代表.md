At the fifth session of the Second World Youth Congress on the 5th, the Chinese delegation presented many precious gifts to the Congress, the World Federation of Democratic Youth (WFDY), various national delegations, and individual delegates. The most outstanding gifts presented to the WFDY and the national delegations were one hundred vases made from American artillery shells captured on the front lines of the Liberation War, filled with vibrant Cymbidium flowers. Liu Kuiji, a Chinese delegate and combat hero, said in his speech: These are the flowers of victory of the Chinese people, the flowers of peace desired by the Chinese people. In addition, embroidered tablecloths and cloisonné vases were presented to the Congress, and portraits of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, Chairman Mao commemorative badges, commemorative albums, and pictorials were presented to delegates from various countries. Seven bolts of wool were specially presented to the fighting youth of Greece and Spain. When the gifts were presented, the entire venue erupted in cheers. The Korean representative was the first to shout "Long live Mao Zedong!" in Chinese. The Soviet delegation, sitting next to the Chinese delegation, also cheered "Long live the heroic Chinese people!" Then, delegations from Britain, Vietnam, Indonesia, Romania, the United States, and others successively shouted "Long live Mao Zedong!" and "Long live the New China!" in their native languages. The Chinese delegation then sang "The East is Red" and shouted "Long live Stalin!" to express their gratitude. When the Hungarian representative offered blessings to the Chinese people's leader Mao Zedong, the Chinese delegation responded with cheers of "Long live Rákosi!" For a time, applause resounded from upstairs and downstairs, and delegates from various countries held up the artillery shell vases, joining the lenses of photographers and filmmakers.
