Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 18th: TASS, Moscow, 16th: *Labor Daily* recently published a thesis by the General Secretary of the North Korean Federation of Trade Unions entitled "The Working Class and Trade Unions in North and South Korea." The thesis states:

　　The heroic Soviet army brought freedom to the Korean people, who had suffered for thirty-six years under the colonial enslavement of Japanese aggressors. Vast prospects for developing into a free nation along a truly democratic path have opened up before us. In North Korea, the most important economic reforms—land reform and the nationalization of industry—have been realized. Labor laws and laws on equality between men and women, etc., have been implemented. The land reform in North Korea has enabled 720,000 landless peasants to obtain land. In three years, the cultivated area has increased by 400,090 hectares, 100,000 new houses have been built for farmers, and many villages have been supplied with electricity. Thanks to the nationalization of industry, 90 percent of the most important industrial sectors are now in the hands of the people. The working class has not only repaired all the damage caused by the Japanese aggressors but has also built a large number of new factories and mines of all sizes. The following figures demonstrate the rapid growth of North Korean industry: In 1947, industry increased by 154 percent compared to 1946, and in 1948, it increased by 139.1 percent compared to 1947. Great achievements have also been made in education. This country, where illiteracy accounted for 70-80 percent of the population under Japanese rule, now has more than 4,300 primary and secondary schools, with a total of 1.74 million registered students. More than two million people have learned to read and write. Under Japanese rule, North Korea did not have a single institution of higher learning, but now it has eleven, with more than 10,000 students.

　　Trade unions have played a significant role in the development of the new Korea. Each trade union had more than 500,000 members in 1949. Trade unions actively participated in the promulgation of labor laws. This labor law stipulates: an eight-hour working day, equal pay for equal work (in old Korea, female workers only received 30 percent of male workers' wages), two or four weeks of paid leave per year, compulsory social insurance, maternity allowances, rest in sanatoriums, permanent and temporary disability relief, labor safety measures, medical treatment, etc. This is the situation of the working class and trade unions in North Korea.

　　In South Korea, the situation is completely different. The fate of the South Korean people has been bound by the shackles of the American occupiers. Until now, South Korean industry has been in a state of chaos. The Americans are plundering South Korea, taking raw materials from there, and handing over the most important industries to pro-Japanese elements, profiteers, and their agents. Feudal relations in the countryside have been preserved intact. The American occupation authorities have outlawed all democratic parties, closed down all progressive newspapers and periodicals, and imprisoned the best representatives of the Korean people, subjecting them to torture and executions. After eliminating the people's organs of power, the Americans completely restored the state apparatus under Japanese rule and strengthened this apparatus with fascists.

　　Under these circumstances, the laboring people of South Korea live a miserable life as exploited coolies. The daily work lasts ten to fifteen hours; wages are extremely low, even only one-fifth of what they were under Japanese rule. The army of unemployed exceeds two million people. There is no social insurance. As before, the land still belongs to landlords and rich peasants. The laboring people of South Korea are waging a heroic struggle for their vital rights. In the past two years, there have been more than 1,700 strikes in South Korea. American puppets summarily execute those who dare to express their dissatisfaction with them. In South Jeolla Province, South Korean police shot and killed 607 people in one month. Many trade union leaders are imprisoned, tortured, and even executed.

　　However, no terror or torture can help the American occupiers and South Korean reactionaries suppress the laboring people's determination to fight for the freedom, democracy, and independence of their country. A powerful guerrilla war is developing in various regions of South Korea.

　　The most powerful progressive group in South Korea, the trade unions, is playing an active role in the political struggle launched by the South Korean people, who are uniting around the Democratic Fatherland United Front.

　　The North and South Korean trade unions, operating under different conditions, are extremely loyal to the World Federation of Trade Unions, to which they belong.

　　南鲜北鲜工人状况形成一个显明对照
  　北鲜职工总同盟总书记论文指出
    【新华社北平十八日电】塔斯社莫斯科十六日讯：劳动报顷登载北朝鲜职工总同盟总书记所写的题为“北朝鲜与南朝鲜的工人阶级与职工会”的论文，该论文写道：
    英勇的苏军给在日本侵略者殖民地奴役下受难三十六年的朝鲜人民带来了自由。沿着真正民主路线向自由国家发展的大的前景已打开在我们的面前。在北朝鲜，最重要的经济改革——土地改革与工业国有化——已经实现。劳动法以及男女平等法等等均已实施。北朝鲜的土地改革已使得七十二万无地的农民获得了土地。在三年当中，耕地面积增加了四十万另九千公顷，农民的新房屋增加了十万幢，许多乡村都有了电力供应。由于工业的国有化，最重要的工业部门已有百分之九十握在人民的手里。工人阶级不仅修好了日本侵略者所造成的一切损害，并且还建设了大量的新的大小工厂与矿山，下面的数字证明北朝鲜工业的飞速成长：一九四七年，工业比一九四六年增加了百分之一五四，而在一九四八年，又比一九四七年增加了百分之一三九点一。在教育方面也获得很大的成绩。这个在日寇统治下文盲占人口百分之七十——八十的国家，现在有四千三百余所中小学校，驻册学生共达一百七十四万人。二百多万人民学会了读书和写字。在日寇统治下，北朝鲜没有一所高等学府，现在却有十一所，有学生一万余人。
    职工会在新朝鲜的发展中起了重大作用。各职工会在一九四九年拥有会员五十万人以上。职工会积极地参加了劳动法的颁布事宜。这个劳动法规定：八小时工作制，同工同酬（在旧的朝鲜女工只能得到男工工资的百分之三十），一年中有两周或四周的工资照付的假期，义务社会保险，产妇津贴，在休养所休息，永久的与临时的残废救济，劳动安全措施，医药治疗等等。这就是北朝鲜工人阶级与职工会的情况。
    在南朝鲜，情形完全不同，南朝鲜人民的命运已束缚在美国占领者的枷锁之下。直到现在，南朝鲜的工业还处于混乱状态。美国人正掠夺南朝鲜，自那里拿走原料，并把最重要的工业交给亲日分子、投机取利者及其代理人。农村中的封建关系被完整无损地保存下来。美国占领当局取缔了一切民主政党，封闭了所有的进步报刊，把朝鲜人民的最优秀的代表抓入监狱，酷刑拷问以及执行枪决。美国人在消灭人民政权机关之后，完全恢复了在日寇统治下的国家机构，并以法西斯分子来加强这个机构。
    南朝鲜劳动人民在这种情况下过着被蹂躏的苦力的凄惨生活。每日工作延续十到十五小时；工资极低，甚至只有他们在日寇统治下的工资的五分之一。失业大军超过二百万人。没有社会保险。——和从前一样，土地还是属于地主和富农。南朝鲜劳动人民正进行争取其切身权利的英勇斗争。在过去两年中，南朝鲜曾发生罢工一千七百余次。美国傀儡们对那些敢于表示对他们不满的人们，实行就地枪决。南朝鲜警察在全罗南道一个月中枪杀了六百零七人。许多职工会领袖被押在监狱里遭受酷刑，甚至被枪决。
    但是，无论什么恐怖或酷刑都不能帮助美国占领者与南朝鲜反动派压倒劳动人民为争取其国家的自由、民主与独立而斗争的决心。强有力的游击战争正在南朝鲜各个地区发展。
    南朝鲜最强大的进步团体——职工会，正在团结于民主祖国联合阵线周围的南朝鲜人民所发动的政治斗争中起着积极作用。
    在不同条件下活动的北、南朝鲜职工会，都极为忠于它们所加入的世界工联会。
