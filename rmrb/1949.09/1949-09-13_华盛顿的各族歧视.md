　　Racial Discrimination in Washington

　　In Washington, black people are forbidden from entering white-only hotels, restaurants, theaters, cars, and "high-class" department stores. It even happened that a dog cemetery refused to bury a black person's dog.

　　In Washington, all black children can only attend schools specifically for black people. The schools are located in dilapidated places, and the facilities are far inferior to those of white schools. From 1946 to 1947, black schools received less funding than white schools; however, each black teacher had to take on 12 to 30 percent more students than white teachers. What are the main subjects that black people study? It is "America."

　　After leaving school, black people cannot find any jobs other than the lowest-paid and most arduous ones. Most black people in Washington work as handymen, porters, coolies, cooks, etc. In this city, 92 percent of handymen, porters, and coolies are black; 77 percent of domestic servants are black; 76 percent of manufacturing workers are black; 74 percent of elevator operators are black; and 68 percent of cooks are black. Black women also mostly hold jobs as elevator operators, cooks, handymen, and domestic servants.

　　From 1930 to 1947, the population of Washington nearly doubled. The increase was in a ratio of three white people to one black person. However, white propaganda says that black people have "invaded" Washington.

　　In fact, due to the discriminatory policies of the Washington real estate bureau against people of color, which increased the price of land purchased by black people by 30 percent, two-thirds of the increased black population is crowded into congested inner-city areas, while four-fifths of the increased white population lives in the vast outer areas.

　　In a speech in the U.S. Senate in 1944, it was revealed that of the 30,700 homes giving priority housing rights to private builders, less than 1 percent, or about 200 homes, were given to black people. In August 1943, of the 2,300 homes specifically allocated for priority housing rights to black people, only eight were completed by the end of the year, and twenty-two were still under construction.

　　Black people account for less than one-third of the residents of Washington. However, two-thirds of Washington's slums are inhabited by black people, and 69 percent of those who die from lung disease are black. A survey in 1947 showed that in Washington:

　　—Nine times more black people than white people live in houses in need of repair;

　　—Four times more black people than white people live in houses without toilet facilities;

　　—Ten times more black people than white people live in dwellings without heating;

　　—Eleven times more black people than white people live in dwellings lacking running water;

　　—Eight times more black people than white people live in dwellings without electricity.

　　In addition, private hospitals allocate only 14.5 percent of their beds to black patients. Except for one hospital in Washington that allows black doctors to see patients, the other twelve private hospitals and local medical societies do not accept black doctors. As a result, the life expectancy of black residents in Washington is ten to twelve years shorter than that of white people; the mortality rate of black mothers is six times higher than that of white mothers.

　　Racial discrimination not only occurs in Washington, but is also extremely common in other parts of the United States. In the southwestern United States, discrimination against Americans of Spanish descent is prevalent, and in the northeastern medical schools, anti-Semitism is rampant. Many states even have laws prohibiting social interaction between black and white people. A survey of racial discrimination in education in seventeen states in the United States shows that in these seventeen states, every state has provisions that white people can obtain a Master of Arts degree, but only eight states give black people this opportunity. Twelve states stipulate that white people can obtain a doctoral degree; no state gives black people this opportunity. In terms of specialized education, four states have dental schools for white people; no state has established this science for black people. Twelve states have law schools for white people; only four states have law schools for black people. Fifteen states have medical schools for white people; no state has medical schools for black people. Fourteen states have pharmaceutical schools for white people; no state has pharmaceutical schools for black people. Nine states have social service schools for white people; no state has social service schools for black people. Eleven states have library management schools for white people; only one state has library management schools for black people.

　　Racial discrimination in the United States is not based on the low intelligence of people of color. Charts of U.S. military service show that very few black people are rejected from military service due to insufficient intelligence. In other words, this barbaric measure in the United States is without any reason. It only shows the true nature of the superficial freedom and so-called "democracy" in the United States.

### 华盛顿的各族歧视

　　华盛顿的各族歧视
    在华盛顿，黑人是禁止出入白人旅馆、饭店、戏院、汽车及“上等”百货公司的。甚至发生过这样的事，有一块狗的坟地拒绝掩埋黑人的狗。
    在华盛顿，所有的黑人小孩只能进专为黑人设的学校。学校设立在破旧的场所，校内设备远不及白人学校。一九四六到一九四七年，黑人学校得到的经费比白人学校要少；但每个黑人教员比白人教员却要多担负百分之十二到三十的学生。黑人学习的主要课目是什么呢？是“美国”。
    从学校出来，黑人除了报酬最少，最辛苦的工作以外，其他工作一概找不到。华盛顿的黑人大都做杂役、门房、掮夫、厨子等等。在这城市，有百分之九十二的杂役、门房、掮夫是黑人；有百分之七十七的佣工是黑人；百分之七十六的制造工人是黑人；百分之七十四的开升降梯的工人是黑人；百分之六十八的厨子是黑人。黑女人也大多担任开升降梯、厨子、杂役及佣工的职务。
    一九三○到一九四七年，华盛顿的人口几乎增加了一倍。增加的比例是三个白人和一个黑人。可是白人的宣传却说是黑人“侵占”了华盛顿。
    事实上，由于华盛顿地产局采取歧视有色人种的政策，提高了百分之三十的黑人购买土地的价钱，增加的黑人有三分之二拥塞在拥挤的内区，而增加的白人的五分之四是住在广阔的外区。
    一九四四年在美国参议院的发言中，揭露在把优先居住权给予私人建筑者的三万零七百栋住所中，只有不到百分之一的住所，即两百栋左右，是给黑人的。一九四三年八月，在优先居住权特别拨给黑人的两千三百栋住宅中，只有八栋于该年年底完成建筑，二十二栋还在建筑中。
    在华盛顿的居民中，黑人占三分之一不到。但华盛顿三分之二的贫民窟的居民是黑人，百分之六十九死于肺病的人是黑人。一九四七年的一个调查说明在华盛顿：
    —九倍于白人的黑人是住在需要修补的房舍；
    —四倍于白人的黑人住在没有＠洗室设备的房子；
    —十倍于白人的黑人的住所没有暖气设备；
    —十一倍于白人的黑人的住所缺少用水设备；
    —八倍于白人的黑人的住所没有电灯设备。
    除此而外，私人医院只拨百分之十四点五的床位给黑人病房。华盛顿除了一家医院可以请黑人医生看病外，其他十二家私人医院及地方医学社都不接受黑人医生。结果，华盛顿黑人居民的寿命比白人要短十年到十二年；黑人母亲的死亡率比白人母亲要大六倍。
    种族歧视不仅发生在华盛顿，在美国其他地方也极普遍。美国的西南部盛行歧视有西班牙血统的美国人，东北部的各医学院盛行反犹太人。有许多州甚至用法律规定禁止黑白人社交往来。有一个关于美国十七个州在教育方面歧视黑人的调查说明在这十七个州中，每一州都有条款规定白人可以得到文学硕土的学位，但只有八个州给黑人这样的机会。有十二个州规定白人可以得到博士学位；没有一州给黑人这种机会。在专门教育方面，有四个州有白人的牙科学校；没有一州为黑人设立这门科学。十二个州有为白人设立的法律学校，只有四个州设有黑人的法律学校。十五个州有白人的医药学校；没有一州设有黑人的。十四个州有白人的制药学校；没有一州没有黑人的。九个州有白人的社会服务学校；没有一州设有黑人的。十一个州有白人的图书馆管理学校；只有一州设有黑人的。
    美国的种族歧视并不是基于有色人种智慧的低落。美国服兵役的图表上说明很少黑人因为智慧条件不够而被拒绝参军。换言之，美国的这种野蛮措施是没有任何理由的。它只表现了美国表面上的自由与所谓“民主”的实质是什么货色。
