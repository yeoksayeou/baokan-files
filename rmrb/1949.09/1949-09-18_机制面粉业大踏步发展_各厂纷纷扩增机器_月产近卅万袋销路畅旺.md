　　Mechanized Flour Industry Advances Rapidly
  　Factories Expand Machinery
  　Monthly Production Nearly 300,000 Bags, Sales Are Brisk
    [This City News] The mechanized flour industry in this city is increasingly developed, being one of the most developed private industries since liberation. Currently, factories such as Wei Yi and Fu Xing are increasing capital, expanding production, and their businesses are flourishing.
    Although there were seventeen mechanized flour factories during the siege last year, only six were barely operating, and eleven were closed. After liberation, with the support of the People's Government, they gradually recovered and developed, and now have increased to twenty-one, not counting the small factories with only one or two machines. The number of employees in each factory has been increasing month by month. From June to August, a total of 121 people were added to the factories, accounting for one-seventh of the total number of employees in the factories. In order to increase production, nine factories successively opened night shifts from June to August, producing day and night without stopping. In terms of output, the total output of the factories in March was 122,198 bags, which increased to 291,550 bags in August. The output in July increased by 31.4 percent compared to June, and the output in August increased by 11.8 percent compared to July. Flour sales (only sales flour, excluding processed flour) also increased month by month. July increased by 7.2 percent compared to June. August increased by 22.7 percent compared to July. This month, all factories are planning to further expand their production capacity. Wei Yi Flour Mill increased its capital by 70 million yuan, and is building a large warehouse. It will install six more machines. After the completion of the project, it can produce 3,000 bags per day, which is double the output of the current ten machines. Wan Yu Hou Flour Mill has purchased four machines (24 inches), which can be installed after the parts are complete. In the future, the output can also be doubled compared to the current three machines (32 inches). Fu Xing Flour Mill is building a factory building and installing five more machines. Other factories such as Tian Zeng Hou and Ju Cheng Yong are also planning to install more machines. In terms of improving quality, the factories also attach great importance to it. Wei Yi Flour Mill has recently added a bleaching machine to make the flour whiter and drier. The reason why this industry can be so developed is basically because flour is a necessity for people's lives, so the government actively supports it in many ways. Eleven factories supply the Municipal Trading Company and the Logistics Department of the North China Military Region with flour for processing. Taking August as an example, a total of 129,167 bags were processed, accounting for 44.3 percent of the total output of the factories, which solved the raw material difficulties of the factories, so that the sales flour and processed flour were mutually adjusted, and production would not be stopped due to lack of raw materials, ensuring and promoting the role of developing production. Secondly, after liberation, American imperialist flour was driven out of the market, and the local flour industry was able to develop in strides. As for the current difficulties in developing production in this industry, the important issue is machinery and parts. It is not easy to purchase large machines for installation in Tianjin and Beijing. Parts such as steel rollers, drawing knives, and sifting silk (filter bottom) are very scarce. Steel rollers used to rely heavily on foreign countries. Therefore, the machine industry needs to meet the needs of the flour industry, engage in research and manufacturing, rely on self-reliance, and improve quality.

　　机制面粉业大踏步发展
  　各厂纷纷扩增机器
  　月产近卅万袋销路畅旺
    【本市讯】本市机制面粉业日益发达，为解放后私营工业中最发达的行业之一。现惟一、福兴等厂，正增加资金，扩大生产，业务蒸蒸日上。
    机制面粉业在去年围城时虽有十七家，但勉强开工的仅六家，停工的十一家。解放后得到人民政府的扶植，逐渐恢复与发展，目前已增至二十一家，内中尚未计入只有一二部机器的小厂。各厂职工人数逐月增添，从六月到八月，三个月里各厂共增添一百二十一人，占各厂总人数七分之一。有九个厂为增加产量，先后在六月到八月间，增开夜班，日夜不停地生产。在产量上，三月份各厂总量是十二万二千一百九十八袋，到八月份增至二十九万一千五百五十袋，七月比六月产量增百分之三十一点四，八月比七月产量增百分之十一点八。面粉销路（只限营业粉，不包括加工粉）也逐月增多，七月比六月增百分之七点二。八月比七月增百分之二十二点七。本月份各厂都正计划把生产能力再予扩大。惟一面粉厂增资金七千万元，正修建大仓库，将增装六部机器，工程完成后，可日产三千袋，比现在十部机器产量大一倍。万裕厚面粉厂已购到四部机器（二十四英寸），零件齐全后即可按装，将来产量也可比现在三部器机（三十二英寸）大一倍。福兴面粉厂正兴建厂房，增装五部机器。其余天增厚、聚成永等厂也纷纷计划增装机器。在提高品质上，各厂也极重视，惟一面粉厂近增设漂粉机，使面粉品质白，水分干。这一行业能够这样发达的原因，基本上是因为面粉为人民生活必需品，故政府多方积极扶植，十一家工厂给市贸易公司和华北军区后勤部供应局代磨面粉，以八月份为例，共代磨了十二万九千一百六十七袋，占各厂总产量百分之四十四点三，解决了各厂原料困难，使磨营业粉和加工粉互相调剂，不致因缺原料而停工，保证促进发展生产的作用。其次，解放后，美帝国主义的面粉从市场被驱出，本地面粉业得以昂首阔步地发展。至于这一行业目前发展生产中的困难，重要是机器和零件问题，各厂增装大型机器在平津不易购到。零件如钢滚子、拉丝刀、筛绢（罗底）很缺，钢滚子过去多仰赖外国。因此，需要机器工业适合面粉业需要，从事研究制造，自力更生，改进品质。
