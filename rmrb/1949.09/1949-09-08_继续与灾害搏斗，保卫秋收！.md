　　According to the situation in North China and Northeast China, a bumper harvest is generally expected this year, except in a few disaster areas. This is the result of the resolute struggle of the Party and millions of people against various disasters and sabotage by special agents and bandits. However, the disasters have not been completely eliminated, and the remnants of the reactionaries are still trying their best to seize the opportunity to sabotage the people's production. As the autumn harvest is approaching, we must be more vigilant, continue to fight disasters, and defend the autumn harvest.
　　The experience of the people in the liberated areas in fighting various disasters over the past year is worth learning from.
　　Taking North China as an example, during the spring plowing and sowing season, there was such a widespread drought and spring famine, followed by more than twenty kinds of insect pests in more than two hundred counties; before the wheat harvest, rare wind, frost and freezing disasters occurred in some areas of Taihang and Taiyue, and hail disasters occurred in more than sixty counties; as soon as summer hoeing began, insect pests rose again; especially after nearly two months of continuous heavy rain, river water flooded, and mountain torrents broke out, causing serious floods in some areas of Hebei and Chahar provinces. However, under the strong leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, the vast number of peasants in North China launched an indomitable and tenacious struggle, and finally victoriously completed the sowing of economic crops and grains, and carried out hoeing and seedling protection. The disaster relief work in the disaster-stricken areas such as western Liaoning in Northeast China has also achieved great results.
　　Experience has proved that as long as our cadres and people have a high degree of political consciousness and a tenacious fighting spirit, and combine the possible scientific and technological techniques with the creativity of the masses, then any disaster and sabotage can be overcome.
　　We must realize that in the new situation where national victory will be achieved this year, agricultural production in North China and Northeast China is of particular importance. In these areas, the land reform has been basically completed. The peasants not only have land free from feudal shackles that can be freely and widely developed for production, but also, because we have large cities and modernized industries and transportation, agricultural production has gained unprecedentedly favorable conditions. Today, urban-rural mutual assistance and the combination of industrial and agricultural production have been placed in the primary position in the development of the entire national economy. In order to restore and develop industrial production, we must first restore and develop agricultural production and increase farmers' purchasing power (this is the necessity of the current policy of industrial production facing the countryside and producing for rural needs). In order to carry out agricultural production, we must also take care of cities and industries, and plan to increase grain and industrial raw materials to lay a solid foundation for industrial production. Whoever does not recognize and is not good at grasping this new characteristic, whoever does not have this overall view in production, whoever is blind in production, and makes production unable to improve. Similarly, in the struggle to defend production and overcome disasters, we must also establish this kind of thinking, so that cadres and people will be more far-sighted, more confident and persevering!
　　In the struggle to overcome disasters, we must not only have sufficient vigilance, oppose complacency and fluke mentality, oppose bureaucracy and tailism; but also establish the idea that "man will conquer nature" and rely on the masses to save themselves through production. All erroneous attitudes that lack confidence in the great power and creativity of the masses, backward feudal superstitious ideas, passively wait for relief, and even falsely report disasters and resist leadership, can only lead to the failure of work and the loss of the people. Similarly, in today's situation where scientific and technological techniques (such as seed selection, seed soaking, and the use of new agricultural tools) can be gradually adopted, we still do not believe in science, neglect technology, and are unwilling to patiently persuade and educate farmers' conservative ideas, and we will not be able to better overcome difficulties and disasters. In addition, in the struggle against disasters, it is also necessary to organize widespread mass mutual assistance and establish strong organizational leadership (such as insect extermination headquarters, insect extermination brigades, flood control headquarters, etc.), stipulate various strict systems (such as intelligence liaison, division of responsibilities, reward and punishment discipline, etc.), implement scientific work methods (such as field inspection and extermination in insect extermination, encirclement and annihilation of key points, and various divisions of labor, etc.), and should emphasize the responsibility of the leaders, personally take action, rely on the rural party branches, and mobilize all working people (women should not be underestimated) to fight together to overcome disasters.
　　Particular attention must be paid to the activities of bandits and special agents and saboteurs. Some comrades believe that in areas where the entire region has been liberated and the land reform has ended, there is no more struggle in the countryside, and therefore they can sit back and relax and carry out so-called "peaceful" production. Facts have proved that this is a completely wrong and extremely harmful idea. In fact, the sabotage activities of counter-revolutionary elements have not been completely eliminated. They are still spreading rumors, causing some peasants to have concerns and not dare to let go of production. In the disaster areas, on the one hand, they seize on the masses' difficulties in life and some shortcomings and loopholes in our work, inciting the masses to "petition", "demand relief", and "rob grain and food", while on the other hand, they are burning seedlings, destroying production tools (saboteurs burning mountains, burning wheat, stealing and unloading waterwheel parts, etc., have been constantly discovered), as well as stealing, creating disputes, organizing strikes, and inciting individual landlords and rich peasants to take back land from the peasants. In the new areas, the harassment of bandits and special agents armed forces is also often heard. All of these should arouse our high vigilance, be exposed at any time, and be severely suppressed by the power of the people's government. However, the stealing behavior of a small number of unreformed loafers in the countryside should be distinguished from the sabotage behavior of counter-revolutionary elements.
　　At present, we must launch a broad mass movement to protect the autumn harvest. First of all, we require that in all villages where there are militia organizations, the militia should be the backbone of protecting the autumn harvest. All militia workers should realize that the main task of the militia in the past was to cooperate with the regular army to fight the enemy and protect the interests of the masses. In the future, the task of the militia will mainly be to defend the production of the peasants. Secondly, on the basis of the masses' voluntary participation, establish the masses' own autumn protection organizations, but oppose and ban the bad practices in some places of apportioning one to two kilograms of wheat per share for "wheat protection grain" in wheat protection, or collecting a "wheat stick", as well as taking the opportunity to watch the wheat and engaging in corruption and other serious infringements on the interests of the peasants. Finally, the provincial governments should issue orders to protect the autumn harvest, and the counties and districts can also formulate specific autumn protection covenants, which should be discussed and approved by the representative meeting and resolutely implemented. So that this year's autumn harvest will achieve a great victory like the Liberation War.

### 继续与灾害搏斗，保卫秋收！

　　继续与灾害搏斗，保卫秋收！
    根据华北和东北的情况，今年除少数灾区外，一般可望丰收。这是党和千百万人民与各种灾害和特务土匪破坏分子进行坚决斗争的结果。但目前灾害尚未完全消灭，反动派的残余仍在千方百计地伺隙破坏人民的生产。现值秋收将至，我们必须更加提高警惕，继续与灾害搏斗，保卫秋收。
    一年来解放区的人民和各种灾害做斗争的经验是值得学习的。
    以华北而论，在春耕播种时期，那样普遍的大旱和春荒，接着又在二百县发生了二十余种虫害；麦收前，太行太岳部分地区发生罕有的风霜冻灾，并有六十余县发生雹灾；进入夏锄，虫灾又起；尤其大雨连绵将近二月，河水泛滥，山洪暴发，河北及察省部分地区酿成严重水灾。然而，华北广大的农民，在共产党和人民政府的坚强领导下，展开了不屈不挠的顽强斗争，终于胜利地完成了经济作物和谷物的播种，并进行了锄苗、保苗。东北辽西等受灾地区的救灾工作，同样有很大成绩。
    经验证明：只要我们的干部与人民有高度的政治觉悟与顽强的斗争精神，运用可能的科学技术与群众的创造性相结合，那末，任何灾害与破坏都是可以被战胜的。
    我们必须认识，在今年即将取得全国胜利的新形势下，华北和东北的农业生产具有特殊重要的意义。在这些地区，土地改革已经基本完成，农民不仅有了毫无封建束缚的可以自由广阔发展生产的土地，而且，因为我们有了大城市及近代化的工业和交通事业，这便使农业生产获得了空前的有利条件。今天，城乡互助、工农业生产相结合，已摆在整个国民经济发展的首要地位。为了恢复发展工业生产，首先就不能不恢复和发展农业生产，提高农民购买力（这就是目前工业生产面向农村、为农村需要而生产的方针之必要性），而进行农业生产，也同样必须照顾城市、照顾工业，有计划的增产粮食和工业原料，为工业生产打下坚固的基础。谁不认识和不善于掌握这个新的特点，谁没有在生产中具备了这种全面的观点，谁在生产上便是盲目的，而使生产不能提高一步。同样，在保卫生产，克服灾害的斗争中，也必须树立起这种思想，使干部和人民，更有远见，更有信心和毅力！
    在战胜灾害的斗争中，不仅要有足够的警惕，反对麻痹侥幸心理，反对官僚主义和尾巴主义；而且还必须确立“人定胜天”和依靠群众、生产自救的思想。一切对群众的伟大力量和创造性缺乏信心，和落后的封建迷信思想，消极等待救济，甚至假报灾情，抵抗领导的错误态度，都只能招致工作的失败和人民的损失。同样，在有条件逐步采用科学技术（如选种、浸种、使用新式农具）的今天，仍然不相信科学，忽视技术，不肯向农民的保守思想进行耐心地说服教育工作，也就不能更好地战胜困难与灾害。此外，在和灾害作斗争中，还必须组织广泛的群众互助，并建立坚强的组织领导（如灭虫指挥部、灭虫大队、防汛指挥部等），规定各种严格的制度（如情报连络、分段负责、奖惩纪律等），实行科学的工作方法（如灭虫中田间查灭，围歼重点及各种分工等），并应强调首长负责，亲自下手，依靠农村党的支部，发动一切劳动人民（妇女尤不可轻视）共同为战胜灾害而斗争。
    对于土匪特务破坏分子的活动，尤须时刻加以注意。一部分同志认为在全区解放、土地改革结束的地区，农村再无斗争了，因而便可高枕无忧地进行所谓“和平”生产。事实证明这是完全错误和极端有害的思想。事实上，反革命分子的破坏活动，尚未完全被肃清。他们仍在散布谣言，使一部分农民有所顾虑，不敢放手生产。在灾区，他们一方面抓住群众生活困难和我们工作中的某些缺点和空隙，煽惑群众“请愿”、“要求救济”、“抢粮抢饭”，而另一方面，正是他们在那里烧毁禾苗，破坏生产工具（各地破坏分子烧山、烧麦、偷卸水车零件等，曾不断发现），以及偷窃、制造纠纷、组织怠工，怂恿个别地主富农分子向农民夺回土地。在新区，土匪特务武装的扰乱亦时有所闻。这些都应引起我们高度的警惕，随时予以揭发，并以人民政权的力量，予以严厉的镇压。但对于乡村中少数尚未改造的二流子等偷盗行为，应与反革命分子的破坏行为区别开来。
    目前，我们必须发动广大群众性的保护秋收运动。首先，我们要求乡村中凡有民兵组织的地方，应以民兵为保护秋收的骨干。一切民兵工作者应该认识：过去民兵的主要任务在于配合正规军打击敌人以保护群众利益，今后民兵的任务则主要的是保卫农民的生产。其次，在群众自觉自愿的基础上，建立群众自己的护秋组织，但要反对和取缔某些地方在护麦中，每分摊派一斤至二斤小麦的“护麦粮”，或敛一个“麦个子”，以及借口看麦，进行贪污等严重侵害农民利益的恶劣作风。最后，各省政府应明令保护秋收，各县区还可拟定具体的护秋公约，经代表会讨论通过，坚决执行。使今年的秋收和解放战争一样得到伟大的胜利。
