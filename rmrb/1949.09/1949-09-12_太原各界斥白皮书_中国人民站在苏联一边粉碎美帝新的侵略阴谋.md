　　Taiyuan Circles Denounce White Paper
　  Chinese People Stand on the Side of the Soviet Union to Smash the New Aggression Plot of US Imperialism
    [Taiyuan Electric] Various agencies, organizations, and democratic parties in Taiyuan City have issued statements denouncing the US imperialist White Paper. The person in charge of the Taiyuan Office of the North China Federation of Trade Unions pointed out that the US imperialist White Paper is a confession of aggression against China, openly exposing their hideous faces. He called on the working class of Shanxi, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, to actively restore and develop production with the spirit of enduring hardship first and enjoying happiness later, in order to smash the imperialist blockade, support the nationwide liberation war, and unite with the broad masses of the people across the country to fight US imperialism to the end. The person in charge of the Taiyuan Municipal Democratic Women's Federation said: Chiang Kai-shek, Yan Xishan, and other running dogs kept by US imperialism have only given us terror, hunger, and death for decades. In the future, if we want to be free from these terror, hunger, and death, we can only unite with the Chinese people under the leadership of the Communist Party to oppose US imperialism. The person in charge of the Taiyuan Municipal Student Union said: The White Paper has educated those who harbor illusions about US imperialism. We must be vigilant against sabotage plots and strengthen unity and struggle. When natural science workers in Taiyuan City discussed the White Paper, all speakers unanimously exposed the US imperialist conspiracy to invade China. They also stated that natural science workers must strengthen political study and respond to the new challenges of US imperialism with hard work. Through their experiences in actual life, all the staff and workers of the Northwest Iron and Steel Company unanimously felt that the time when US imperialism and the Chiang-Yan bandit gang talked about "friendship" most enthusiastically was the time when the staff, workers, and people of Taiyuan suffered the most. They said: All the conspiracies of US imperialism have been clearly recognized by all the Chinese people. Yang Zixiu, Vice Chairman of the Taiyuan Municipal People's Representative Conference, said: US imperialism shamelessly provokes the friendship between the Chinese people and the Soviet Union. This cliché, which refutes itself, is clearly recognized by the Chinese people. It is US imperialism, not the Soviet Union, that helped the reactionaries to massacre the Chinese people. The socialist Soviet Union is a fortress of peace and democracy and is a true good friend of the Chinese people. The Chinese people's road can only follow the instructions of the Chinese people's leader Mao Zedong to "lean to one side" - leaning towards the peace camp of the Soviet Union. When all members of the Taiyuan Municipal Branch of the Democratic League refuted the US imperialist White Paper, they listed the facts of US imperialism's aggression against China in history and stated that the crime of US imperialism in assisting the Chiang-Yan bandit gang to cruelly kill the Chinese people cannot be forgiven not only by us Chinese people, but also by the people of the world.

　　太原各界斥白皮书
　  中国人民站在苏联一边粉碎美帝新的侵略阴谋
    【太原电】太原市各机关、团体、民主党派顷对美帝白皮书，纷纷发表谈话，予以驳斥。华北总工会太原办事处负责人指出，美帝的白皮书是侵略中国的自供状，公开暴露了他们的狰狞面目。他号召山西的工人阶级，在毛主席的领导下，以吃苦在先享福在后的精神，积极恢复与发展生产，以粉碎帝国主义的封锁，支援全国解放战争，并和全国广大人民团结起来，与美帝国主义斗争到底。太原市民主妇女联合会负责人说：美帝国主义所豢养的蒋介石、阎锡山等走狗，数十年来给我们的只是恐怖、饥饿与死亡。今后我们要免除这些恐怖、饥饿与死亡，只有在共产党的领导下，和中国人民团结在一起，反对美帝国主义。太原市学生联合会负责人说：白皮书教育了对美帝国主义存有幻想的人们，我们要警惕破坏阴谋，加强团结斗争。太原市自然科学工作者在座谈白皮书时，所有发言者一致揭露了美帝国主义侵华的阴谋。并表示自然科学工作者定要加强政治学习，用努力工作来回答美帝国主义的新的挑战。西北钢铁公司全体职工在实际生活的体验中，一致感到美帝和蒋阎匪帮讲“友谊”最热的时候，正是太原职工和人民痛苦最深的时候。他们说：美帝的一切阴谋，已被我们全中国人民认识得清清楚楚了。太原市各界代表会副主席杨自秀说：美帝寡廉鲜耻的挑拨中国人民与苏联的友谊，这个不攻自破的陈腔滥调，中国人民认得很清楚，帮助反动派屠杀中国人民的是美帝而不是苏联。社会主义的苏联，是和平民主的堡垒，是中国人民真正的好朋友，中国人民的道路，只有依照中国人民领袖毛泽东的指示“一边倒”——倒向苏联的和平阵营方面去。民主同盟太原市支部全体盟员于驳斥美帝白皮书时，从历史上列举了美帝侵华的事实后称，美帝援助蒋阎匪帮惨杀中国人民的罪恶，不仅我们中国人民不能饶恕，世界人民也要向他申讨。
