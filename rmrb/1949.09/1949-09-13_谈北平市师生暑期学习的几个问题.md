　　Some Issues Concerning the Summer Study of Teachers and Students in Beiping
    Xǔ Lìqún

    The university and middle school students and primary and secondary school teachers of Beiping have victoriously completed their first summer vacation since liberation. More than 16,000 students and 5,800 primary and secondary school teachers used their vacation time to participate in six summer study organizations: the Youth Academy, the Summer Study Group for University and Middle School Students, the Study Group for Graduates of North China Universities, Party Member Training Classes, Youth League Cadre Study Sessions, and Primary and Secondary School Teacher Study Sessions. They studied several fundamental issues of the Chinese revolution and learned the ideology and working methods of serving the people.
    In addition, more than 2,000 students went to factories to tutor workers in literacy, interned in factories in Northeast and North China, and participated in social services in other practical work. In total, more than 23,000 teachers and students participated in summer study and practical work.
    The vast majority of teachers and students who participated in the study felt that their thinking had been greatly enriched during the summer. They naturally eliminated the influence of many reactionary thoughts, resolved many doubts, changed their attitude towards work and study, made great strides in establishing a worldview of serving the working people, and greatly strengthened their ties with the Chinese Communist Party and the working people. In the Youth Academy and the Summer Study Group for University and Middle School Students alone, more than 1,380 students joined the New Democratic Youth League; in the Primary and Secondary School Teacher Study Sessions, more than 600 members of reactionary parties and groups voluntarily confessed.
    Now many middle schools have begun the second half of their courses. Although the time has not been long, there has been a significant increase in the enthusiasm of teachers and students for teaching, their attitude of responsibility, and their spirit of love for labor, presenting a fresh atmosphere in the schools. This is one of the concrete manifestations of the results of the summer study.
    Since the liberation of Beiping, the enemies with guns have been eliminated, and political power is now in the hands of the people. However, the remnants of reactionary ideas—feudal ideas, comprador ideas, and fascist ideas—spread by the enemy in their long-term reactionary deceptive propaganda continue to disturb and plague the minds of some people, and have not been immediately eliminated along with the enemies with guns. On the other hand, although the broad masses of people enthusiastically support the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, they lack systematic and profound understanding, especially among intellectual youth, who still hold many individualistic, liberalistic, supra-class, and narrow nationalist viewpoints that are inconsistent with or even opposed to the interests of the people. However, a large number of intellectual youths are eager to understand the truth of serving the people and hope to combine with the revolution and the working people. From the first day of liberation, they have warmly requested the Communist Party and the People's Government to help them study revolutionary thought and theory. Although most schools have since added political classes, they have only partially satisfied this demand, and it is clearly not enough. Therefore, when the various summer study organizations were successively established at the beginning of the summer vacation, the vast number of school youths and teachers enthusiastically joined these short-term study sessions, setting off a wave of learning.
    The achievements are enormous. The reasons for these achievements are primarily due to the correct leadership policies of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government. This is reflected in the fact that the organization of summer study is by no means a "shot in the dark" or, like the Kuomintang reactionaries, an attempt to poison the minds of intellectuals; rather, it truly meets the ardent demands of the vast number of teachers and students to study revolutionary thought and revolutionary theory. The teaching guidelines and content are also not an attempt to solve too many problems in a short period of time, but are aimed at the ideological situation and needs of intellectual youths since liberation. Generally, they start with the materialist conception of history—the view that labor creates the world and that class struggle exists—and then discuss the laws of social development, and then relate to the individual's worldview, criticizing reactionary and backward ideological viewpoints; then they learn some policies and professional knowledge. Except for Party Member Training Classes and Youth League Cadre Study Sessions, which focus more on studying Party and League theory and work, the essence is to carry out education in the standpoint of serving the working people and the initial scientific methodology—Marxism-Leninism. These have nothing in common with the blind and arbitrary "Party-ification education" of any reactionaries. The method opposes dogmatism. Theory is closely linked with practice, that is, linking with individual thought, conducting introspection and self-examination, criticism and self-criticism. In addition, there are typical reports of practical business and work experience, and participation in half-day labor, etc. All of these closely integrate study with practice, which is most necessary for intellectuals who have been influenced by old education that is divorced from reality. Secondly, the spirit of democracy and freedom of thought was fully promoted in the study. This is the best encouragement for the enthusiastic emotions of mass learning. All mass summer study organizations uniformly adopted the principle of completely voluntary participation; the organization of life and study was mostly managed by the participants themselves. Party and League members and non-Party and League members studied together, without distinction. In the study and discussion, democracy was truly promoted, and free and enthusiastic discussions and criticisms were launched in pursuit of truth. The acceptance of the study content and discussion conclusions completely relied on the understanding and consciousness of the participants, without any coercion or compulsion. Because scientific Marxism-Leninism is true gold that is not afraid of fire and is a truth that becomes clearer with debate. The facts fully prove this point. Thirdly, a lively and vivid learning method suitable for young people was adopted. For example, the Youth Academy was divided into various districts, and students could fully participate in one or several kinds of learning according to their own wishes; they could study politics, make up for lessons, and participate in collective recreational activities. For example, visiting factories, having parties with workers, group exercises, sports competitions, singing and performing plays, and making paper glider models are all activities that young people love and are beneficial to their physical and mental health. These all contribute to the success of learning. Finally, the lectures given by many responsible Party and government comrades were of great help to the enlightenment of the students' thinking due to their high ideological level, clear principles, and rich content.
    These more than 20,000 teachers and students, after returning to school, will play a significant role in developing the people's cultural and educational cause, implementing the New Democratic education policy, continuing to eliminate reactionary ideas, and transforming and criticizing all old ideas, adding a force to the ideological front in the future. However, the teachers and students who participated in the summer study must recognize that the complete transformation of the old ideas of intellectuals, the short-term summer study is only laid a little foundation, and in the future in the regular study, they must link with reality, critically transform and learn the old courses, and continue to make unremitting efforts. Moreover, resolutely standing on the people's standpoint, opposing reactionary ideas, and making persistent and unremitting struggles against all feudal, comprador, and fascist ideas, and against all hidden reactionary ideological toxins, is still one of the primary tasks at present, and much work remains to be done.

　　谈北平市师生暑期学习的几个问题
    许立群
    北平市大学中学的同学们和中小学教职员们已胜利地度过了解放后的第一个暑假。一万六千余名同学和五千八百余名中小学教师，利用假期在青年学园、大中学生暑期学习团、华北各大学毕业生学习团、党员训练班、青年团干部学习会以及中小学教职员学习会等六个暑期学习组织内，进行了暑期的学习，学习了有关中国革命的若干根本问题，学习了为人民服务的思想和工作方法。
    此外，到工厂中为工人补习文化，到东北和华北各工厂中去实习及到其他实际工作中去参加社会服务的同学有二千多人。总计有二万三千余师生参加了暑期学习和实际工作。
    绝大部分参加学习的师生，都认为自己的思想在暑期内得到了丰富收获，自然而然地扫除了不少反动思想的影响，解决了很多疑虑的问题，改变了工作态度与学习态度，在建立为劳动人民服务的人生观方面大大前进了一步，也大大密切了和中国共产党和劳动人民的联系。只在青年学园和大中学生暑期学习团内，加入新民主主义青年团的同学即达一千三百八十多人；在中小学教职员学习会里六百多参加过反动党团的分子自动坦白。
    现在许多中学已经开始了下半年的课程，虽然时间还不长，但在师生教学的热情、认真负责的态度和爱好劳动的精神都有了显明的提高，使学校中呈现出一片新鲜气象。这就是暑期学习成果的具体表现之一。
    北平从解放以来，拿枪的敌人已被消灭，政权也已握在人民的手里。但是，敌人在其长期的反动欺骗宣传中所散布的反动思想——封建思想、买办思想、法西斯思想的残余还在一部分群众头脑中继续扰乱和作祟，还没有随着拿枪的敌人一同立即肃清。另一方面，广大群众对中国共产党、人民政府虽热情拥戴，但是缺乏系统和深刻的了解，特别是知识青年，还存在着许多与人民利益不一致或者反人民利益的个人主义、自由主义观点、超阶级观点、狭隘的民族主义观点。但大量的知识青年迫切希望了解为人民服务的真理，希望和革命结合、和劳动人民结合。他们从解放的第一天起，就热烈要求共产党和人民政府能帮助他们学习革命的思想和理论，后来绝大部分学校虽增设了政治课，但只在一定程度上满足了这一要求，而且显然是很不够的。因此，在暑假开始各学习组织相继成立时，广大学校青年和教师们就热烈拥入了这些短期学习会，掀起了学习热潮。
    成绩是巨大的，获得成绩的原因，首先是由于中国共产党和人民政府的领导方针的正确。这表现在组织暑期学习绝不是“无的放矢”，或是象国民党反动派那样，为了毒化知识分子的思想；而是真正符合了广大师生学习革命思想和革命理论的热烈要求。教学方针和内容，也不是企图在短期内解决太多的问题，而是针对着解放以来知识青年思想情况与需要，一般都是从唯物史观——劳动创造世界、阶级斗争等观点着手，谈到社会发展的规律，进而联系到个人的人生观，批判反动的及落后的思想观点；再进而学习一些政策与业务知识。除了党员训练班和青年团干部学习会，更多地学习党团的理论与工作之外，实质上都是进行了为劳动人民服务的立场和初步的科学思想方法——马列主义的教育，这些都和任何反动派的盲从武断的“党化教育”没有丝毫共同之点。在方法上是反对教条主义的。理论与实际密切联系，即联系个人思想，进行反省检讨，批评与自我批评。此外，还有实际业务及工作经验的典型报告，并参加半日劳动等。这些都使学习与实践紧密结合，这对于受脱离实际的旧教育影响的知识分子是最必要的。其次，学习中充分发扬了民主和自由思想的精神。这对于群众学习的热烈情绪是一个最好的鼓励。所有暑期群众的学习组织，一律采取完全自愿参加的原则；生活和学习的组织，大半由参加学习者自己来管理。党团员和非党团员在一起学习，不分畛域。在学习和讨论中真正发扬了民主，为追求真理展开了自由地热烈地讨论和批评。对学习内容与讨论结论的接受，完全倚靠参加学习者的理解与自觉，没有任何的勉强或强制。因为科学的马列主义是不怕火炼的真金，是愈辩愈明的真理。事实完全证明了这一点。其三，采取了适合青年需要的活泼生动的学习方式。例如青年学园，分设各区，学生可完全按照自己的意愿，参加一种或数种学习；既可以学政治、也可以补习功课，更可以参加集体的文娱康乐活动。例如参观工厂，和工人联欢，团体操，体育竞赛，唱歌排剧，制造纸制滑翔机模型等，都是青年爱好的而又有益青年身心的活动。这些都有助于学习的成功。最后，很多党政负责同志的讲大课，由于思想水平高，原则明确，内容充实，对学员思想的启发，有很大的帮助。
    这两万多师生回到学校以后，在今后发展人民的文化教育事业，贯彻实现新民主主义教育方针上，在继续肃清反动思想，改造、批判一切旧思想方面，将会起着不小的作用，为今后思想战线增加了一支力量。但是，参加暑期学习的师生们，必须认识到知识分子旧思想的彻底改造，暑期短期学习只是奠下了一点初基，而今后在经常的学习中，必须联系实际，批判地改造与学习旧课程，并继续作不断的努力。而且，坚决站在人民立场，反对反动思想，向一切封建的、买办的、法西斯思想作坚持不懈的斗争，向一切隐藏的反动思想毒素的斗争，仍是当前的首要任务之一，还待作很大的努力。
