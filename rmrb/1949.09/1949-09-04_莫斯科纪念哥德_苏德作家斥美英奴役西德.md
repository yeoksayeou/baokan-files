Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 3rd: TASS Moscow reports: The Soviet people are widely commemorating the bicentennial of the birth of the great German poet Goethe.  The commemorative meeting was held on August 29th in the Column Hall of the Trade Union Building, under the auspices of the Soviet Writers' Union and the All-Soviet Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries.  The presidium of the conference included Soviet writers Fadeyev, Tikhonov, Marshak, and German female writer Anna Seghers, etc.  In his opening remarks, Fadeyev pointed out: Goethe's creative work reflects the great and immortal things that can be called the German people's contribution to the spiritual development of mankind.  This great writer who created "Prometheus," "Egmont," and "Faust" is by no means, as all anti-national reactionaries in Germany have tried to say in the past, especially now, an "Olympian god" standing high above life. Today, reactionaries and traitors are trying to use the historically weak points of Goethe's genius to revive fascism in Germany; regardless of the entire spirit of his creative work, they are trying to turn him into almost a "cosmopolitan" in order to allow Anglo-American imperialism to enslave his motherland. Today, in the struggle for a unified and democratic Germany, Goethe is the banner of the best and most progressive people of Germany. We, the Soviet people who grew up in the spirit of Lenin and Stalin's liberation of all mankind, wholeheartedly sympathize with the German people's desire for freedom, peace, and progress. We have deep respect for everything valuable in the national culture of every nation.
    In his report "Goethe and the Modern Era," poet Alexei Surkov pointed out: With Goethe's entry, the childhood of German literature ended and its heyday began, just like Pushkin in the history of Russian literature. He emphasized Goethe's patriotism, pointing out that Goethe, in regarding himself as a servant of the people, never lowered himself to the human hatred manipulated by national chauvinists. Today, the progressive forces of the German people are commemorating Goethe under the banner of continuing to expand and strengthen the struggle against the tendency to divide Germany into "East" and "West" and to turn Germany into a colony of Anglo-American imperialism. He concluded by saying: Goethe's art is familiar and loved by the Soviet people. Russian translations of Goethe's complete works have been reprinted many times, and Soviet readers consider Goethe a great humanist whose works embody the best of what the German people have contributed to the world's literary treasury. The speech by German progressive female writer Anna Seghers was also welcomed by the conference. A grand concert was held at the end of the conference.

　　莫斯科纪念哥德
  　苏德作家斥美英奴役西德
    【新华社北平三日电】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联人民广泛纪念伟大德国诗人哥德的两百周年诞辰。纪念会在苏联作家联盟和全苏对外文化关系协会的主持下，于八月二十九日在职工会大厦圆柱大厅举行。大会主席团中包括苏联作家法捷耶夫、吉洪诺夫、马尔沙克，德国女作家娜·西格斯等。法捷耶夫在开幕词中指出：哥德的创造性工作，反映了可以称之为德国人民对人类的精神发展之贡献的伟大和不朽的东西。这位创作“普罗米修斯”、“哀格蒙特”、“浮士德”的伟大作家，决不是象德国一切反民族的反动派过去特别是现在所力图说成的那样，是一个高高站在人生之上的“奥林比亚之神”。今天反动派和卖国贼力图利用哥德的天才中历史性弱点来在德国复活法西斯主义；不顾他的创造工作的整个精神，力图把他变成几乎是“世界主义者”，以利于让英美帝国主义来奴役他的祖国。今天，在争取统一民主德国的斗争中，哥德是德国最优秀的进步的人民的旗帜。我们，在列宁与斯大林的解放全人类的精神中长大的苏联人民，全心同情德国人民这一争取自由、和平与进步的愿望。我们对每个民族的民族文化中的一切宝贵的东西怀着深深的尊敬。
    诗人亚历克西·苏尔科夫在其“哥德与现代”的报告中指出：随着哥德的进入，德国文学的童年时代就告终结而开始了全盛时期，正如普式庚在俄罗斯文学史中一样。他强调哥德的爱国主义，指出哥德在把自己当作人民的仆人时，从未把自己降低到被民族沙文主义者所摆布的人类憎恨中去。今天，德国人民的进步力量，是在继续扩大和加强反对把德国分裂成“东”、“西”，反对把德国变成美英帝国主义的殖民地的倾向的斗争旗帜下纪念哥德的。他最后说：哥德的艺术是苏联人民所熟悉而爱好的。哥德全集的俄译本一再重版，苏联读者认为哥德是伟大的人道主义者，他的作品体现了德国人民贡献到世界文学宝库中的最优秀的东西。德国进步女作家安娜·西格斯的演说也受到大会的欢迎。大会最后举行盛大音乐会。
