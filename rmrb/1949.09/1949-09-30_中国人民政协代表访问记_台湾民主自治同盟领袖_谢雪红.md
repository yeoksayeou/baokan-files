　　A Visit with a Representative of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference
  　Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League Leader—Xie Xuehong
    Bai Sheng
    Xie Xuehong is from Changhua, Taiwan, and is forty-eight years old this year. Her childhood was extremely tragic. Her father was a coolie worker who lived a life of hard labor. When she was twelve years old, her parents died one after another due to poverty and illness. From then on, she was sold as a slave, and later tricked into becoming a concubine. These sufferings and humiliations made her unable to endure any longer. Therefore, at the age of nineteen, she ran away to work as a female worker and seamstress. At that time, it was during the "May Fourth" Movement, and a national enlightenment movement was also launched in Taiwan. She quickly accepted the influence of new ideas and ran to the "Cultural Association," an anti-Japanese organization in Taiwan at the time, to participate in activities. Here, she began to learn a lot of new knowledge, and at the same time, she had a strong yearning for the revolution in the motherland.

    During the "May Fourth" Movement, she went to Hangzhou. She experienced the "May Seventh," "May Ninth," and "May Thirtieth" movements at that time. At that time, whether in newspapers or in parades, she shouted the slogan "Recover Taiwan." At that time, her name was Xie Feiying. Later, she went to work at the Shanghai General Labor Union. In September 1925, she entered the Department of Social Sciences of Shanghai University at that time, which was the first time she entered school in her life. In December of that year, she went to study at the Moscow Oriental University in the Soviet Union. In the Soviet Union, she participated in the struggle against Trotsky and the liquidation of Japanese Fukumotoism. In 1928, she was arrested in Shanghai by the Japanese consulate and sent to Taiwan, but because no evidence was found at that time, she was released soon after. From this time on, she engaged in activities to lead the people's resistance struggle. She opened an "International Bookstore" in Taiwan that specialized in selling social science books, but this bookstore was soon shut down. In 1931, she was arrested again and suffered cruel persecution by the enemy. She was sentenced to fifteen years in prison in the first trial and thirteen years in the second trial. However, even in such a prison life under the brutal and vicious oppression of the enemy, she still boldly led the prisoners in their struggle. Therefore, in prison, she was subjected to various tortures by the enemy for six consecutive months, such as being poured cold water, pricked with needles under her fingernails, and beaten on her legs with sticks until they were swollen... However, all this did not scare her, but instead strengthened her resistance to the enemy.

    When she said this, anger made her silent for a moment. Another representative of the Taiwanese people sitting next to her told the reporter in broken Mandarin: "At this time, the name 'Xie Xuehong' had been deeply engraved in the hearts of the Taiwanese people."

    She spent nine years in such cruel prison life. She fell ill in prison, and the enemy saw that she had no hope of living, so they finally asked her family to carry her out of prison. Her illness quickly improved. During this period, even when she was lying in bed, she still led the Taiwanese people and Japanese soldiers in the "anti-war" movement.

    Soon, Japan surrendered. Xie Xuehong first led the organization of mass organizations such as the "People's Association" and the "Farmers' Association." At that time, more than 30,000 people participated quickly. It wasn't until the Chiang Kai-shek bandit sent Chen Yi to Taiwan to carry out reactionary rule that he discovered that the power of the people was so strong. Out of fear, he became angry and soon ordered the dissolution of the "People's Association" and the "Farmers' Association." However, the Taiwanese people were not suppressed, but instead accumulated strength at this time, waiting to rise up and fight.

    On February 28, 1947, there was an uprising throughout Taiwan. She was elected chairman of the citizens' assembly convened by the people of central Taiwan. Since then, the name "Xie Xuehong" has become the mortal enemy of the Kuomintang reactionaries. Arrest warrants with rewards for the capture of "Xie Xuehong" appeared everywhere in Taiwan.

    Finally, Xie Xuehong talked to the reporter about the current liberation of Taiwan and her feelings about participating in the People's Political Consultative Conference. She said that the reason why such an unprecedentedly great People's Political Consultative Conference could be held today is entirely due to the wise and great leadership of the Chinese Communist Party—Chairman Mao and the arduous battles of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. Regarding the Common Program of this CPPCC, she said: "We must not only abide by it, but also strive to resolutely implement it." She believes that after the establishment of the new Central People's Government, the issue of liberating Taiwan will also be victoriously resolved soon.

　　中国人民政协代表访问记
  　台湾民主自治同盟领袖—谢雪红
    柏生
    谢雪红，台湾彰化人，今年四十八岁了。她的幼年是极其悲惨的，父亲是一位苦力工人，成年劳苦的生活着。当她十二岁那年，父母因贫病交迫相继死去，从此她便被卖去当奴婢，后来又被骗去做妾。这种种的痛苦和耻辱使她再也不能忍受下去，因此，在她十九岁的那年，她便逃跑出去做女工和女裁缝。那时正值“五四”运动的时候，台湾也展开了民族启蒙运动，她很快的便接受了新思潮的影响，跑到当时台湾的一个抗日组织“文化协会”里参加活动。在这里，她开始学了许多新的知识，同时对祖国的革命有了强烈的向往。
    “五四”运动时，她到了杭州，她经历了当时的“五七”“五九”“五卅”等运动，在那时无论报纸上或游行的队伍里，她都高呼出“收回台湾”的口号，那时她的名字叫做谢飞英。以后，她跑到上海总工会去工作。一九二五年九月她进入了当时的上海大学社会科，这是她有生第一次进入学校。当年十二月，她到苏联莫斯科东方大学学习。在苏联，她参加了当时的反托洛斯基的斗争和清算日本福本主义的斗争。一九二八年她在上海被日本领事馆捕获送到台湾，但当时终因找不到证据，不久即被释放。从这个时候起，她从事领导人民反抗斗争的活动，便在台湾开设了一个专售社会科学书籍的“国际书局”，但不久这个书局被查封。一九三一年，她再度被捕，受到了敌人残酷的迫害。她初审被判为十五年的徒刑，第二审为十三年。然而就在这样敌人残暴毒狠压迫的狱中生活中，她仍然大胆的领导着犯人们进行斗争。因此她在狱中，一连六个月中，不停的受着敌人的各种刑法，如灌凉水、用针扎她的手指甲、用棍子打肿她的腿，……然而这一切并没有把她吓倒，相反却增强了她对敌人的反抗。
    当她说到这里，愤怒使她沉默了片刻，坐在她旁边的另一位台湾人民的代表用着不纯熟的国语轻轻地告诉记者：“就在这个时候，台湾人民的心里便已深深的留下了一个‘谢雪红’的名字。”
    在这样残酷的牢狱生活中，她过了九年，病在狱中，敌人看她是没有希望活了，最后便要她的家人把她从狱中抬出去。她的病就很快的好起来，这个时期，即便当她躺在病床上，依旧领导着台湾人民和日本士兵进行“反战”运动。
    不久，日本投降，谢雪红首先领导发动组织了“人民协会”和“农民协会”的群众团体，当时很快就有三万多人参加。直到蒋匪派陈仪到台湾去进行反动统治的时候，发现了人民的力量这样强大，他从恐惧中恼怒起来，不久，便下令解散“人民协会”、“农民协会”。但是台湾人民并没有被镇压下去，却在这个时候积蓄力量，等待着起来斗争。
    一九四七年二月二十八日，全台湾的暴动，她被台湾中部人民召开的市民大会，推为主席。自此以后“谢雪红”的名字成为国民党反动派的死对头。在台湾到处出现了捉拿“谢雪红”的通缉悬赏令。
    最后，谢雪红和记者谈到目前台湾的解放与这次参加人民政协的感想。她说，今天所以能够召开这样历史上空前伟大的首次人民政协会议，这完全是由于中国共产党——毛主席英明伟大的领导与中国人民解放军艰苦战斗的结果。对于这次政协会议的共同纲领，她说：“我们不但要遵守而且要努力坚决实现”。她相信在新的中央人民政府成立以后，解放台湾的问题也马上就会胜利的实现了。
