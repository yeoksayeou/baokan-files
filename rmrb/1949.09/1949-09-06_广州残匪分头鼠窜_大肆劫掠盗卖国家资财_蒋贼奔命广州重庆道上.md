　　Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 4th: Chiang Kai-shek flew from Taipei to Guangzhou on August 23rd, and then transferred to Chongqing on the 24th for a so-called "Southwest Inspection." According to foreign news agency reports, Chiang's sudden departure from Taiwan to Guangzhou and Chongqing was aimed at urgently preventing the possible widespread impact of the Changsha Uprising on the remaining Kuomintang forces, in order to manage his bandit lairs in Sichuan, Guizhou, Yunnan and Guangxi, and to stubbornly resist after the fall of Guangzhou. According to reports from the Kuomintang Central News Agency and the American Associated Press: the remaining Kuomintang bandit officials in Guangzhou have almost all fled. Since the 8th of last month, more than 10,000 people have fled from Guangzhou to Chongqing, more than 4,000 have fled to Taiwan, and less than 700 remain in Guangzhou. The bandit "Presidential Palace" originally had 2,000 people, but now only 100 remain. According to Shanghai Wenhui Daily, when the bandit leaders fled Guangzhou, they looted or auctioned off national assets on a large scale. The bandit "Post-War Rehabilitation and Custody Committee" alone auctioned off more than 500 vehicles, while the pseudo-Fisheries Administration Office transported 1,500 tons of fishing equipment to Hong Kong for auction. The pseudo-Materials Supply Bureau even openly held a large auction of daily necessities. Other assets such as warehouses, factories, and real estate were also sold off at low prices.

　　广州残匪分头鼠窜
  　大肆劫掠盗卖国家资财
  　蒋贼奔命广州重庆道上
    【新华社北平四日电】蒋匪介石八月二十三日由台北飞往广州，二十四日即转往重庆作所谓“西南视察”。据外国通讯社消息披露，蒋贼此次突然离开台湾到广州和重庆的目的，是为了急于防止长沙起义在国民党残余阵营中可能引起的广泛影响，以便经营其在川黔滇桂的匪窟，在广州失守后，进行负隅顽抗。据国民党中央社及美国的合众社消息透露：广州国民党残余匪帮官员几已逃亡一空。自上月八日起，由广州逃亡重庆者已达万余人，逃亡台湾者达四千余人，留在广州者已不足七百人，匪“总统府”原有两千人，现只剩下一百人。另据上海文汇报消息称：匪首们从广州逃走时大肆劫掠或拍卖国家资财，仅匪“善后事业保管委员会”所拍卖的车辆即有五百辆之多，伪渔管处则把为数一千五百吨的渔业器材运往香港拍卖，伪物资供应局更公开举行日用品大拍卖。其他如仓库、厂房、地产等亦多被低价拍卖。
