　　Beijing-Shanghai Through Express Train
  　Frequently Arrives on Time
    [Our Newspaper's Dispatch] Since September, the Beijing-Shanghai through express train has been able to maintain on-time arrivals frequently. Of the train No. 12, departing from Shanghai to Beijing daily, from August 20th to September 15th, only one train was delayed by 12 minutes, with the rest arriving on time. The train No. 11, departing from Beijing to Shanghai daily, has also been completely on time from September 7th to the present.
    It is reported that after the Beijing-Shanghai through express train began service on July 10th, due to water damage causing loose tracks, many sections of the route required slow travel. Dispatch and operational personnel had not, in their thinking, treated the through express train as a top-tier train. Furthermore, crossing the river was affected by air raid delays, resulting in frequent train delays, sometimes as long as a full day and night. The Ministry of Railways attached great importance to this, issuing temporary measures for the Beijing-Shanghai through express train on August 10th, instructing the responsible persons of each railway administration, station, and segment operations department to personally manage dispatch and enhance the awareness of the importance of the Beijing-Shanghai through express train among operational personnel, strengthening their sense of responsibility. The schedules of trains No. 11 and 12 were also adjusted to avoid conflicts with air defense times, and the railway lines were universally reinforced, increasing travel speed. Gradually overcoming various shortcomings, it is now able to maintain on-time operation frequently.

### 平沪直达快车　经常保持正点到达

　　平沪直达快车
  　经常保持正点到达
    【本报讯】平沪直达快车自九月以来，已能经常保持正点到达。每日由上海开到北平的十二次快车从八月二十日到九月十五日之间，只有一次晚到十二分钟，余均正点。每日由北平开往上海的十一次快车，从九月七日至现在亦能完全正点。
    按平沪直达快车自七月十日通车以后，因水害关系线路松软，沿途须慢行地方很多，调度和运转业务人员，在思想上未曾将直达快车当作上等列车办理，过江时又受空袭影响延误时间很多，因此列车经常晚点，有时延误一昼夜之多。铁道部对此极为重视，特于八月十日发出平沪直达快车临时掌握办法，指令各管理局，各站、段运转部门负责人均需亲自掌握调度，提高业务人员对平沪直达快车重要性的认识，加强责任心。并将十一、十二次车改点，避免与防空时间冲突，线路也普遍补强行车速度提高。逐渐克服了各种缺点，现已能经常保持正点运行。
