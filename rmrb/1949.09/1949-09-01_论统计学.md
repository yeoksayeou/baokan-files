　　On Statistics
    Wu Qingyou
    Marxism-Leninism has transformed social science into a true science and made it a tool for transforming the world. In the theoretical works and practical activities of the founders of Marxism-Leninism, statistics has also become one of the weapons of the proletariat's struggle. These founders of scientific socialism, by mastering figures and facts, proved the terrible exploitation of capitalism and the extreme poverty of the working masses. At the same time, they also used figures and facts to confirm that the sweet words of the exploiting class were completely false, that capitalism was bound to perish, and that the working masses were bound to win. Engels' book "The Condition of the Working Class in England" can be said to be the first application of statistics in Marxist-Leninist writings. "Das Kapital" is also full of statistical figures. In 1866, the First International Geneva Conference formulated the proletariat's statistical program for the first time, pointing out the great role of statistics in the working class's liberation movement, as a sharp weapon for the proletariat in the class struggle, and seeking out the trends and laws of social development in figures and facts.
    Marxist statistics has been further developed in Lenin's writings. Books such as "The Development of Capitalism in Russia" and "Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism" prove Lenin's brilliant application of Marxist statistics. How to examine figures, how to correct them, how to make summaries, and how to scientifically analyze the collected materials – all these questions can be found in Lenin's related works with theoretical and practical instructions.
    Lenin once pointed out that if there is no "comprehensive, state accounting and supervision of production and the distribution of products, the power of the workers, the freedom of the workers cannot be sustained, and a return to the shackles of capitalism is inevitable."
    Stalin also pointed out the importance of statistics. He said: "Any work of the country, any planned work, is meaningless without correct calculation, and calculation is meaningless without statistics. Calculation cannot move forward without statistics." In his reports at the Party Congress, Stalin made comprehensive and scientific analyses based on statistics of the socialist economy and the world capitalist economy. Only under the light of Lenin and Stalin's doctrines on planning, socialist design, and planned leadership can we correctly understand the content and tasks of accounting and statistics in the Soviet Union. Stalin's instructions on opposing egalitarianism and adopting economic accounting have great significance for the theory of statistics in the Soviet Union. Stalin's "On Dialectical and Historical Materialism" profoundly expounds the foundation of revolutionary Marxist dialectics, which is the key to understanding all theoretical problems of statistics and the compass for practical application of statistics.
    Statistics is a class science, a science of Party spirit. It is a sharp weapon for the proletariat to fight against the bourgeoisie. Lenin used statistics to defeat the counter-revolutionary views and positions of the Narodniks, Mensheviks, Socialist-Revolutionaries, and Trotsky-Bukharin factions. The Bolshevik Party and the Soviet government used statistics as a method of socialist construction, helping to manage the economy, educate the masses, and consolidate socialist labor discipline. In capitalist society, statistics completely serves individual capitalists and the entire bourgeoisie. Statistics there is used as a tool to strengthen capitalist rule and intensify labor exploitation. Statistics serving the interests of the people should be good at collecting data, distinguishing data, and analyzing data so that it can reflect objective reality and the laws of development.
    Marxist philosophy teaches us that the world is extremely complex and diverse. Every thing and every phenomenon can be studied from the qualitative aspect and also from the quantitative aspect. It is unscientific to isolate quality and quantity from each other, nor is it scientific to unify quality and quantity. Statistics is the science of studying the quantitative connections of various phenomena and the interrelationships between various phenomena. Although mathematics also studies the interrelationships of quantities, it studies them in the most abstract form, abstracting quantities from concrete qualities. Statistics studies the interrelationships of quantities in the most concrete form. However, statistics does not study all interrelationships of quantities, but rather the interrelationships of special kinds of quantities. Therefore, statistics studies the interrelationships and connections of quantities as the expression of a process. This process permeates the aggregate. The characteristics of these aggregates include a large number of units, and the units included in the aggregate have signs, and the signs are changing, that is, changing from one unit of the aggregate to another unit of the aggregate. The inherent regularity of the entire process that permeates these aggregates is expressed through individual deviations.
    Statistics always relies on a certain specific science, and the phenomena of this specific science are studied using statistical methods. Only this specific science can reveal the most important laws in the corresponding field. On the other hand, any qualitative cognition cannot be supplemented without quantitative research. Therefore, although statistics depends on specific sciences, it is not a servant of specific sciences. Lenin once said: "Social and economic statistics is one of the most magnificent weapons of social cognition."
    There is a clear and close connection between mathematics and statistics. Mathematics studies quantity in its most abstract form, defining the most general formulas and the most abstract laws of quantity. For all its importance, mathematics cannot constitute the main content of statistics, and it cannot determine the method of statistics. Statistics has different objects, tasks, and characteristics from mathematics. Statistics engages in research in the entire complexity and diversity of concrete quantities. At the same time, the general theory of statistics is a summary of the study of quantitative relationships, while the classified statistics is the study of the quantitative aspects of specific concrete phenomena. Depending on the characteristics of specific concrete phenomena, the content and methods of each department of statistics may have significant differences from each other. Each department of statistics uses the methods of general theory, develops it, concretizes it, and supplements it with special research methods.
    The main characteristic of statistics is to summarize the individual components and individual units that constitute a certain phenomenon. Therefore, statistics is a method of measuring social phenomena and conducting qualitative and quantitative research on them. Not any quantitative research can be called statistics. Statistics relies on the summation of individual components to measure and study various social phenomena, thereby discovering their regularity. Therefore, the object of statistical research should be social phenomena, and it should be the relationship between the various components that constitute a certain phenomenon. Using statistics, it is possible to characterize the results of a certain work from qualitative and quantitative aspects. In order to elucidate the sprouts of new phenomena and their development trends, statistics must pay attention to individual components and select the most significant ones from them. At the same time, do not ignore the aggregate of statistics. As is well known, one of the basic characteristics of nature and society is universal interconnection and interdependence. These connections are very diverse and multifaceted. These phenomena are expressed in qualitative forms as well as in quantitative forms. The components combined into a certain general connection constitute the aggregate. Naturally, in fact, there are not one, but many kinds of connections and relationships between any phenomena and things. But those relationships that emerge from the method of producing material values, class relations, are the most important and the most primary. The study of this kind of relationship should become the focus of attention of social statistics. The aggregate of various components combined by the relations emerging from the production method is the most important aggregate that statistics should study. Taking the Soviet Union as an example, belonging to this kind of aggregate are industry, collective farms, state-owned farms; the working class, the peasant class, and intellectuals. The task of statistics is to study the process of development of the aggregate and the process of mutual influence between different aggregates. An important task of statistics is to accurately specify which components should be included in the aggregate. It is not enough to use only one kind of statistics here, because to determine the components of the aggregate, one should analyze the qualitative connections between various phenomena. Here one must turn to the specific sciences that study a certain aggregate.
    Among bourgeois statisticians, there is a popular view that all phenomena should be divided into typical and atypical. The so-called typical phenomena are mainly limited to the natural world, and atypical phenomena are mainly limited to society. They believe that statistics is the study of the second category of phenomena, that is to say, social phenomena are not typical, which is of course a wrong view, because the development of society is also regular.

　　论统计学
    吴清友
    马、列主义把社会科学变为真正的科学，并使它成为改造世界的工具。在马、列主义奠基者的理论著作和实际活动中，统计学也成为了无产阶级战斗的武器之一。这些科学社会主义的创始者们，把数字和事实掌握在自己手里，证明了资本主义可怕的剥削和劳动大众极度的贫困。同时他们也用数字与事实确证了剥削者阶级的甜言蜜语完全是虚伪的，资本主义是必然灭亡的，劳动大众是一定胜利的。恩格斯著的“英国工人阶级状况”一书，可以说是统计学在马、列主义著作中的第一次的应用。“资本论”中也充满着统计数字。一八六六年第一国际日内瓦会议首次制定了无产阶级的统计学纲领，指出了统计学在工人阶级解放运动中的巨大作用，是无产阶级在阶级斗争中的利器，并在数字与事实中寻出社会发展的趋势和规律。
    马克思主义的统计学，在列宁的著作中获得进一步的发展。“俄国资本主义的发展”，“帝国主义论”等书都证明了列宁对马克思主义的统计学之卓绝的运用。如何审查数字，如何纠正，如何做总结，如何把搜集到的材料加以科学的分析，这一切问题在列宁的有关著作中都可以找到理论和实际的指示。
    列宁曾经指出，如果对“生产及生产物的分配没有全面的、国家的计算与监督，劳动者的政权，劳动者的自由是支持不住的，回到资本主义的桎梏之下是不可免的”。
    斯大林也曾指出统计学的重要意义。他说：“任何国家的工作，任何计划的工作，没有正确的计算是没有意义的，而计算没有统计也是没有意义的。计算没有统计不能往前推进一步”。斯大林在党大会上的屡次报告中都依据社会主义经济及资本主义世界经济的统计作全面的科学分析。只有在列宁、斯大林关于计划、关于社会主义设计、关于计划领导的学说光照之下，才能正确地了解计算及统计在苏联的内容与任务。斯大林关于反对平均主义以及采用经济核算制诸指示，对苏联的统计学理论具有极大的意义。斯大林“关于辩证唯物论及历史唯物论”的著作，极度明显和深刻地阐述了革命的马克思主义辩证法之基础，是了解统计学一切理论问题的钥匙，是实际应用统计学的南针。
    统计学是阶级的科学，是党性的科学。是无产阶级与资产阶级作斗争的尖锐武器。列宁利用统计学击溃了民粹派、孟什维克、社会革命党以及托洛茨基——布哈林派反革命的观点和立场。布尔塞维克党及苏维埃政府利用统计作为社会主义建设的方法，帮助管理经济，教育群众，巩固社会主义的劳动纪律。在资本主义社会中，统计学完全为着个别资本家及全体资产阶级而服务。统计学在那里被用作加强资本统治，加强劳动剥削的工具。为人民利益而服务的统计学，应当善于搜集资料，辨别资料，分析资料使能反映客观的实在性和发展的规律。
    马克思主义的哲学教导我们，世界是极复杂和多样的。每一事物，每一现象可从质方面，也可从量方面加以研究。不可把质与量相互隔离，也不可把质与量统一起来。二者都是反科学的。统计学是研究各种现象的量的联系以及各种现象之间相互关系的科学。数学虽然也研究量的相互关系，但它是在最抽象的形式上加以研究，把量从具体的质中抽象出来。统计学是在最具体的形式上研究量的相互关系。然而统计学并不研究一切量的相互关系，而乃是研究特种的量的相互关系。因此，统计学研究的是量的相互关系与联系而作为过程的表现。此种过程是渗透到总和中去。这些总和的特征，是包括一大批单位，列入总和中去的单位具有标志，而标志是变化着，即是从总和的某一单位变化为总和的别的单位。渗透入这些总和中去的整个过程的内在规律性，是经过单独的偏差而表现出来。
    统计学始终依系于某种具体的科学，这种具体科学的现象用统计的方法加以研究。只有此种具体的科学才能揭露相当领域内最重要的规律。另一方面，任何质的认知，不能没有量的研究加以补充。所以统计学虽是依存于具体的科学，然而不是具体科学的婢仆。列宁曾经说过：“社会、经济的统计，是社会认知最雄伟的武器之一。”
    数学与统计学之间存在着显然的和密切的联系。数学是在最抽象的形式上来研究量，规定最一般的公式以及最抽象的量的规律性。数学就其整个重要性而言，它不能构成统计学的主要内容，它不能规定统计学的方法。统计学具有与数学不同的对象、任务和特点。统计学是在具体的量的全部复杂性和多样性中从事研究。同时统计学的一般理论是研究数量关系的总结，而分门别类的统计学是研究特定的具体现象的量的方面。依系特定的具体现象之特点，每一部门的统计学之内容与方法可能彼此有重大的差别。每一部门的统计学利用一般理论的方法，把它发挥起来，把它具体化，而以研究的特殊方法补充之。
    统计学的主要特征是把构成某种现象的个别成份，个别单位加以总结。因此，统计是对各种社会现象加以测量，加以质和量的研究之方法。不是任何数量方面的研究都可称为统计学。统计学是倚靠个别成份的总结，对各种社会现象加以测量和研究，从而发现其规律性。因此统计学研究的对象，应当是社会现象，应当是构成某一现象的各种成份之间的关系。运用统计学可能把某一工作成果从质和量方面表征出来。统计学为要剖明新现象的萌芽及其发展的倾向，必须关心个别的成份，并从其中挑选出最显著的。同时也不要忽略统计学的总和。如所周知，自然与社会的基本特点之一，是普遍的相互联系和相互依存。这些联系是非常多样的和多面的。这些现象在质的形态上，以及在量的形态上表现出来。结合为某一总联系的各成份构成总和。自然，事实上任何现象与事物之间，不是存在着一种联系及关系，而是存在着许多种联系及关系。但从物质价值生产方法中涌现出来的那些关系，阶级关系，是最重要的和最主要的。此种关系的研究，应当成为社会统计学的注意中心。由生产方法中涌现出的诸关系所结合成的各种成份之总和，是统计学应当加以研究的最重要的总和。以苏联为例，属于此种总和的是工业、集体农场、国营农场；工人阶级、农民阶级、知识分子。统计学的任务是在研究总和发展的过程，以及各种不同总和之间相互影响的过程。统计学的重要任务是精确地规定何种成份应当加入总和中去。这里仅用一种统计学是不够的，因为要规定总和的成份，应当分析各种现象之间质的联系。这里须求助于研究某种总和的具体科学。
    在资产阶级的统计学者中流行着一种见解，认为应当把一切现象划分为典型的，及非典型的。所谓典型的现象主要限于自然界，非典型的现象主要限于社会。他们认为统计学是研究现象的第二种范畴，即是说社会现象不是典型的，这当然是错误的见解。因为社会的发展也是有规律性的。
