　　Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 23rd. The East China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China promulgated two documents on the 15th of this month: the "Draft of the Provisional Regulations on Rent Reduction in Rural Areas of the East China New Area" and the "Draft of the Articles of Association for Farmers' Associations in the East China Region"; At the same time, it also issued the "Decision on the Promulgation of the Draft of the Provisional Regulations on Rent Reduction in Rural Areas of the East China New Area and the Draft of the Articles of Association for Farmers' Associations in the East China Region."
    The decision pointed out that the two documents were formulated in order to unite all working farmers, reduce feudal exploitation, and initially improve the lives of farmers in the East China New Area, where mass conditions are not yet mature and land reform preparations are not yet complete, in order to facilitate the restoration and development of production.
    The "Draft Provisional Regulations on Rent Reduction" stipulates that the rent of land leased by landlords, old-style rich peasants, and all organs, schools, ancestral halls, temples, churches, etc., should be reduced by 25 to 30 percent based on the original rent. However, workers, handicraftsmen, poor freelancers, poor revolutionary military family members, and widowers, widows, orphans, the disabled, etc., who lease all or part of their land due to lack of labor, not exceeding the average amount of land owned by local middle peasants, may be given a smaller reduction or no reduction at all through consultation between the government and the farmers' association. All rent owed by farmers to landlords and rich peasants before liberation shall be exempted. After the rent reduction, those who have perpetual tenancy rights in contracts and customs shall continue to be valid; those who do not have perpetual tenancy rights, the landlord shall not take back the land for subletting, pawning, or selling. Regarding the issue of debt, the regulations stipulate that all debts of war criminals and heinous despots shall be abolished. Debts owed by farmers to landlords and old-style rich peasants in the past, if they are of a usurious nature, shall all stop accruing interest and only repay the principal; low-interest debts shall continue to repay the principal and interest as usual. The interest rate for loans after the promulgation of the regulations shall be freely agreed upon by both parties. The above "Draft Provisional Regulations on Rent Reduction" only applies to rural areas in the new area and does not apply to the old area and cities.
    The "Draft Articles of Association for Farmers' Associations" stipulates that all hired peasants, poor peasants, middle peasants, rural handicraft workers, and all rural revolutionary intellectuals who are loyal to serving the working people, regardless of ethnicity, gender, religion, or belief, who agree with the articles of association of the association and voluntarily join the association, may be members of the association. The Provincial (or County, Township) Farmers' Association Congress is the highest authority of the association. The congress elects a number of executive committee members and alternate members to form the executive committee, which is the highest authority of the association during the adjournment of the congress. The executive committees at all levels also elect a standing committee to handle daily affairs.

　　华东局发布重要决定实行新区减租组织农民协会
    【新华社上海二十三日电】中共中央华东局特于本月十五日颁布“华东新区农村减租暂行条例草案”、“华东区农民协会组织章程草案”两个文件；同时并发布“关于公布华东新区农村减租暂行条例草案及华东区农民协会组织章程草案的决定”。
    决定指出：两文件是为了在华东新区群众条件尚未成熟、土地改革准备工作尚未完备的情况下，团结全体劳动农民、减轻封建剥削、初步改善农民生活，以利恢复和发展生产而制定的。
    “减租暂行条例草案”规定减租办法为：凡地主、旧式富农及一切机关、学校、祠堂、庙宇、教会等所出租之土地，其租额应按照原租额减低百分之二十五至三十。但工人、手工业者、贫苦自由职业者、贫苦革命军人家属和鳏、寡、孤、独、残废等因缺乏劳动力而出租全部或一部分土地不超过当地一般中农所有土地的平均数者，可由政府及农会协议酌情少减或不减。解放以前农民对地主富农的欠租一律免交。在减租以后凡契约及习惯上有永佃权者，得继续有效；无永佃权者，地主不得收回土地转租，出典或出卖。关于债务问题，该条例规定：凡战争罪犯和罪大恶极的恶霸分子，其债款一律废除。过去农民向地主及旧式富农所借的债务，如属高利贷性质者，一律停利还本，低息债务仍照常还本付息。条例公布后之借贷利息，由双方自由议定。上项“减租暂行条例草案”仅适用于新区农村，不适用于老区和城市。
    “农民协会组织章程草案”规定凡雇农、贫农、中农、农村手工业工人及一切忠心为劳动人民服务的农村革命知识分子，不分民族、性别、宗教、信仰，赞成本会章程自愿入会者，均得为该会会员。全省（或全县、全乡）农协代表大会为该会最高权力机关。大会选举执行委员及候补委员若干人组织执行委员会，在代表大会闭幕期间为该会最高权力机关。各级执行委员会并选出常务委员会，办理日常会务。
