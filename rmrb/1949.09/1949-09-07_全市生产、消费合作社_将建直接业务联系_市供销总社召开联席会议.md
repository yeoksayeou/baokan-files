　　To adjust supply and demand, reduce intermediate exploitation, and establish direct contact between consumers and producers, the Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative held a joint meeting of production and consumption cooperatives yesterday (the 6th). Representatives from eight large consumer cooperatives, including the Railway Bureau, Qianmen District, the 70th Ordnance Factory, and the Telecommunications Bureau, as well as nine women's production cooperatives with different businesses and one nail-making production cooperative, attended the meeting, along with relevant departments such as the National Women's Federation and the Municipal Women's Federation Production Department. According to reports from various production cooperatives, current members and cadres are diligently working hard, wholeheartedly wanting to make the cooperatives successful; however, some made shoes but have no sales channels, and most cooperatives are struggling with a lack of work. Comrades from the Annei Daertiao Women's Textile Cooperative also raised a situation: a certain agency contracted out the making of uniforms through the Da Junyi Clothing Store, and it was transferred three times before it reached them the fourth time. It is said that initially, each set cost ten jin of rice, but they only received three jin. This shows that everyone does not pay enough attention to production cooperatives. After listening, comrades from the consumer cooperatives stated one after another: "Your shoes have no sales channels, and our members have no shoes to wear. Because the General Cooperative does not have many things, we have to go to the market to buy them, often spending more money or buying inferior goods." They said: "Why is there a disconnection between consumption and production? This is due to insufficient communication between us, and the General Cooperative should bear most of the responsibility. There are currently 230,000 consumer cooperative members in the city. If we can connect well, the products of eight or nine production cooperatives may not be able to meet the demand. The General Cooperative should unify the supply of raw materials, promote the sale of finished products, and encourage the exchange of finished products or the exchange of raw materials for finished products. It should also plan the specifications and types of production, assigning them to various specialized cooperatives to make them more specialized, achieve excellent workmanship and low prices, and then open up sales channels. Currently, each consumer cooperative can only recover one-third to one-fifth of the full salary each month, indicating that most things are taken from the market. We hope to organize a variety of productions, such as grinding sesame oil, making tofu, noodles, soy milk, milk, or running cooperative vegetable gardens and cooperative-run vegetable stalls and restaurants. The General Cooperative should also open a soy sauce garden and stationery factory, provide small loans to support production groups, and strive for consumer cooperatives to sell all or more of the production cooperatives' products, so that producers and consumers can be further combined." The persons in charge of the various consumer cooperatives, with the attitude of fraternal cooperatives, expressed their willingness to strongly support the development of production cooperatives, and put forward requests to the production cooperatives with a serious attitude. The People's Printing Factory and the Postal Bureau Cooperative both requested that the shoes be simple and durable. Qianmen District requested that they be introduced to towel weaving workers. The People's Printing Factory further proposed that the General Cooperative make a table of the addresses, businesses, telephone numbers, and persons in charge of each cooperative and print it for distribution, so that they can directly conduct business contacts with each other.

　　Then, the meeting specifically discussed the guiding principles for establishing production cooperatives, democratic management, member education, the target members, and reducing costs and strengthening management. The general opinion was: at present, the focus should be on organizing household sideline production and establishing supply and marketing production cooperatives based on the individual economy, adopting the general policy of centralized management, decentralized production, reducing costs, and small profits for sales, and implementing piece-rate wages and other methods to enable production income to supplement household income and solve some problems. We cannot adopt the factory management method of employing labor and fixed wages to reduce expenses; we should not set up service personnel, carry forward the spirit of hard work, and exercise the labor viewpoint. Managers should consult with everyone in everything, establish regular meetings, discuss business plans, and publicize economic income and expenditure. When developing members, we should focus on developing the families of working citizens and pay attention to their work attitude and technical level. We should also combine with the Municipal Women's Federation and the District Federation of Trade Unions offices to carry out member education, change the idea of ​​underestimating labor, establish a down-to-earth and hardworking work style, strengthen technical research, and conduct observation and comparison of finished products to improve product quality, so as to open up sales channels.

　　全市生产、消费合作社
  　将建直接业务联系 　 市供销总社召开联席会议
    【本报讯】为调剂供求，减轻中间剥削，建立消费者和生产者的直接联系，市供销合作总社于昨（六）日召开生产、消费合作社联席会议。到铁路局前门区、七十兵工厂、电信局等八个大的消费社和九个不同业务的妇女生产合作社及一个制钉生产合作社，并有全国民主妇联、市妇联生产部等有关部门参加。据各生产社汇报，目前社员和干部都在埋头苦干，一心想把合作社搞起来；但有的作了鞋没有销路，多数合作社苦于没有活作。安内大二条妇女纺织社的同志并提出一个情况：某机关经过大军衣庄包作制服，连转三次手，到第四次才转到她们手里。据说最初每套出米十斤，而她们只落到三斤。这说明大家对生产合作社是重视不够的。消费社同志听完之后纷纷提出：“你们的鞋子没销路，我们的社员没鞋穿。因为好多东西总社没有，我们只好到市场去买，时常多花钱，或买到劣货。”他们说：“为什么发生消费和生产脱节的现象呢？这是由于彼此联系不够，总社应负大部责任。现全市已有二十三万消费社员，如能很好联系，八九个生产社的产品恐还不能满足需求。总社今后应统一供给原料，推销成品，发动成品互换或以原料换成品。并计划生产规格及种类，分配到各专业合作社去作，使之向专门化发展，达到工精价廉，才能打开销路。现在各消费社每月只能收回全工资的三分之一到五分之一，说明大部东西取自市场，希望组织多种多样的生产，如磨香油、作豆腐、挂面、豆浆、牛奶或办合作菜园、合作性质的菜摊饭馆等。总社并应开一酱园及文具工厂，举办小额贷款以扶植生产小组，争取消费社都卖或多卖生产社的产品，使生产者和消费者进一步结合起来。”各消费社负责人以兄弟社的态度，都表示愿以大力支持生产社的发展，并以严肃的态度向各生产社提出要求。人民印刷厂和邮政局合作社都要求鞋子要朴实耐穿。前门区请求给他们介绍织毛巾工人。人民印刷厂更提出请总社把各社的住址、业务、电话、负责人制表印发，以便相互间直接进行业务上的联系。
    接着又专门讨论了生产社的建社方针、民主管理、社员教育、社员对象及减低成本与加强经营管理等问题。总的意见是：目前以组织家庭副业生产、成立以个体经济为基础的供销生产合作社为重点，采用集中经营、分散生产、降低成本、薄利供销的总方针，施行计件工资等办法，使生产所得能贴补家用，解决部分问题。不能采用雇佣劳动、固定工资的工厂经营办法，以减少开支；不设勤务人员，发扬艰苦作风，锻炼劳动观点。经理人员要处处和大家商量，建立定期会议，讨论业务计划、公布经济收支。发展社员时，着重发展劳动市民家属，并注意到劳动态度和技术程度。并结合市妇联与区工会办事处协力进行社员教育，改变轻视劳动的思想，树立踏实、苦干的工作作风，加强技术研究，进行成品的观摩、比较，提高产品质量，以此打开销路。
