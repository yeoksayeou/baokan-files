　　Overfulfilling the Task of 200,000 Winter Uniforms
　　Clothing Factory Holds Summary and Awards Ceremony Yesterday
    Fourth Branch and Duanfu Cotton Padding Factory Win Championship
    [Our Newspaper] After the Beiping Clothing Factory victoriously completed the first phase of winter uniform production, it convened a worker representative conference yesterday (18th) afternoon to summarize the results of the production competition and award prizes to the winning units. The factory accepted the first phase of winter uniform production task in mid-July, requiring completion by the end of August. Due to the short timeframe, workers launched a production competition, voluntarily working overtime to rush production, completing the task as scheduled. A total of 200,000 sets of cotton-padded clothes and 157,600 cotton hats were made. The factory's various branches, cotton padding factories, and other ten units all conducted democratic summaries after production, assessed competition results, with the Fourth Branch and Duanfu Cotton Padding Factory achieving the highest scores, winning the championship. The Second Branch and Heita Temple Cotton Padding Factory won the runner-up, and other factories also achieved excellent results. The Beiping Film Studio has already filmed the factory's production competition.
    Yesterday (18th) afternoon, over one hundred worker representatives from various units attended the worker representative conference, chaired by Su Rui, director of the trade union. Han Ke-ning, director of the Political Department of the Logistics Department of the North China Military Region, as well as representatives from the Organization Department of the Beiping Municipal Committee of the CCP and the Industrial Workers' Union of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions attended the meeting to offer congratulations. During the conference, factory director Li Zuobin first reported on the summary of this crash task: (1) When the task was initially assigned, there was a lack of confidence due to many objective difficulties; however, due to the increased class consciousness of the workers, who voluntarily worked overtime to rush production, with some even working up to sixteen hours a day, the task was completed as scheduled. (2) It motivated the lagging workers, involving the entire factory in the crash competition. (3) There were significant gains in conservation, saving over 780,000 yards of thread alone. The motor transport team saved one hundred and four gallons of gasoline. In terms of packaging, improvements in technology reduced the volume of each package of cotton clothes by 8.4 cubic feet, saving two thousand barrels of gasoline when transported to the front lines by truck. (4) The Party, government, labor union, and Youth League strengthened their unity during this task. Although the achievements were great, there were still shortcomings, such as inadequate pre-planning for labor and machine allocation, resulting in situations where the front-line supply could not keep up with the rear and quilting, leading to frequent adjustments of manpower, machinery, and increased workers and machines, wasting a lot of time and labor. At the same time, the quality was not high. Although corrections were made at any time, more than 20% were still substandard. Some stitch sizes were too large, some collars were uneven, and the hem binding did not meet specifications. Secondly, the evaluation of competition results was not done well enough. Although output, quality, work morale, fire prevention, anti-espionage, and conservation were set as standards for judging performance, only spot checks were conducted, and no regular records were kept of the various achievements. When summarizing the experience of this crash task, Factory Director Li mentioned several points: 1. It is necessary to rely on the workers and let them discuss the task. 2. Piece-rate wages are reasonable and can stimulate production, but quality must be strictly checked. 3. The Party, government, labor union, and Youth League must unite to form a leading core to ensure the completion of the task. 4. It is necessary to recognize the characteristics of military industry: that is, tasks often come suddenly, and the work of clothing factories is semi-handicraft, so we must learn to scientifically organize manpower and machines. After the summary report, the chairman awarded two large red banners with the inscription "Your glory is created with labor" to the Fourth Branch, the first place winner in the sewing factory competition, and the Duanfu Cotton Padding Factory, the first place winner in the cotton padding factory competition. Subsequently, representatives from various branches and cotton padding factories expressed their desire to learn from the workers of the Fourth Branch and Duanfu Cotton Padding Factory. Representatives from the Fourth Branch and Duanfu Cotton Padding Factory also stated that they would overcome past shortcomings, improve quality, and continue to maintain the glory of the red banner in the second phase of the task. Finally, the general factory union called for a major competition to welcome the second phase of the task, to accept the experience of the crash competition in the first phase of the task, to continue to improve output and quality, and to carry out conservation not only in terms of thread, but also in all aspects. Representatives from various branches and cotton padding factories unanimously responded, aiming to complete the second phase of the task ahead of schedule.

　　突击完成廿万套冬装任务
  　被服厂昨总结授奖
    四分厂段府铺棉厂获冠军
    【本报讯】北平被服厂胜利完成第一期冬装生产任务后，于昨（十八）日下午召开职工代表大会，总结生产竞赛结果，并给优胜单位发奖。该厂于七月中接受第一期冬装生产任务，要在八月底以前完成，因为时间短促，职工们便展开了生产竞赛，自动加班突击，如期完成了任务。共做了棉衣二十万套，棉帽十五万七千六百顶。该厂所属各分厂，铺棉厂等十个单位，在生产结束后都做了民主总结，评定了竞赛成绩，第四分厂及段府铺棉厂分数最多，得了冠军，第二分厂、黑塔寺铺棉厂得了亚军，其他各厂成绩也都很优越。北平电影制片厂并已将该厂生产竞赛情形拍成影片。
    昨（十八）日下午职工代表会上，共出席各单位职工代表一百余人，由职工会主任苏瑞主席，华北军区军需部政治部主任韩克宁，及中共北平市委会组织部代表与市总工会产业工会代表等均到会致贺。大会中首先由厂长李作斌报告这次突击任务的总结：（一）在当初发下任务时，由于客观上有许多困难，是信心不足的；但由于工人群众阶级觉悟提高，自动加班突击，甚至有的工友每天工作到十六小时，因此任务得以如期完成。（二）带动了落后的工友，使全厂卷入突击竞赛中。（三）在节约方面有很大的收获，单在线上就节省了七十八万多码。汽车运输队节省了汽油一百零四加仑。在打包方面，由于从技术上改进，使每包棉衣体积缩小了八·四立方尺，用汽车送到前方可以节省汽油二千桶。（四）党政、工、团在这次任务中加强了团结。成绩虽大，但缺点还是有，如事先对劳动力与机器的配置不周到，因此有时前车供不上后车和铺绗，发生随时调配人力、机器、增加工人和机子的情形，浪费时间和劳力不少。同时质量也不高，虽然曾随时加以纠正，但结果还有百分之二十以上不够标准，有的针码大了，有的领子不齐，下摆包边不合规格等。其次，评判竞赛结果也做得不够好，虽然定了产量、质量、工作情绪、防火防特、节省等项为评判成绩标准，但只是抽查了一下，没有经常的登记各项成绩。在总结此次突击任务的经验时，李厂长说到几点：一、必须依靠工人群众，将任务交给他们讨论。二、计件工资是合理的，可以刺激生产的，但必须严格检查质量。三、党、政、工、团必须团结形成领导核心，才能保证任务完成。四、要认识到军工的特点：即任务往往是突然来的，而且被服厂工作是半手工业的，必须学会科学的组织人力机器。在总结报告后，主席以写着“你们的光荣是用劳动创造的”两面大红旗奖给缝纫工厂竞赛第一名第四分厂，及铺棉工厂第一名段府铺棉厂。随着各分厂、铺棉厂代表纷纷表示要向第四分厂及段府铺棉厂的工友们看齐。四分厂与段府铺棉厂的代表也表示要在第二期任务中克服过去的缺点，提高质量，继续保持红旗的光荣。最后由总厂工会号召迎接第二期任务大竞赛，接受第一期任务突击竞赛中的经验，继续提高产量与质量，并且要不但从节线上，而且要从各方面进行节约。各分厂、铺棉厂代表一致响应，要争取第二期任务提前完成。
