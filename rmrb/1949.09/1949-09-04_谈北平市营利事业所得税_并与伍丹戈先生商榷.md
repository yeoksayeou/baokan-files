　　On the Business Income Tax of Peiping Municipality
    —A Discussion with Mr. Wu Dangge
    Hong Liu
  　(I)
    The business income tax for the second half of the 37th year of the Republic of China (1948) in Peiping Municipality is currently being collected. Industrial and commercial households are busy raising funds and paying taxes, and some are requesting reductions or exemptions. A few are taking a wait-and-see attitude; the tax authorities are busy explaining and persuading, and adjusting the business categories of various industries in an effort to make the burden fair and reasonable. However, this collection work clearly still has some difficulties and shortcomings.
    First, the investigation and research work is not thorough enough. The understanding of the number of households, the operating and profit situation, and the affordability of various industries is still rather superficial. In particular, because many industrial and commercial households have not abandoned their old habits and are unwilling to report the true situation, the investigation is very difficult, and it is not easy to obtain objective and comprehensive accurate materials.
    Second, the organizational leadership is not sound enough. Although there are good organizational forms such as the Selection Committee and the Joint Assessment Committee, they are still not sound enough. For example, the Selection Committee, composed of ten representatives from the industrial and commercial sector and seven representatives from government agencies and state-owned enterprises, does not meet very often, and some issues have not been carefully studied and discussed together. Most of the members of the Joint Assessment Committee are mutually selected from the directors and supervisors of the old trade associations, and more than 95% are the heads of the old associations. The representation is still very insufficient, and many small and medium-sized industrial and commercial households still have many opinions about this committee.
    Third, the assessment work is still biased. Some of the tax bureau staff, in assisting various groups in the assessment work, made the mistake of doing everything themselves, failing to fully utilize the power of the masses; some were irresponsible, leaving the assessment work entirely to the directors and supervisors of the trade associations or the group leaders, allowing them to distribute the business categories themselves, which was close to apportionment, forming a laissez-faire phenomenon, resulting in an unbalanced burden among large, medium, and small households within some industries; on the other hand, it also created an unbalanced burden between industries. For example, the burden of the department store industry itself is relatively reasonable, but compared with banks, money shops, and the cloth industry, their burden seems heavier. Another example is that the rice, flour, and grain industry and the coal yards and coal shops are both businesses of daily necessities, but the Class A households of coal yards and coal shops do not bear as much as the medium-sized households of rice, flour, and grain. Compared with the paper and stationery industry and the book industry, whose business nature is similar, the book industry is obviously lighter. In addition, due to the one-sided emphasis on the principle that industry is lighter than commerce, the burden of some industrial households and commercial households with equal operating conditions is too disparate. All these situations are shortcomings of this assessment work.
    However, these shortcomings are unavoidable in Peiping, a newly liberated big city, and in the first collection. These can be completely overcome and corrected in the future. Therefore, we should not take a hypercritical attitude towards the first business income tax levied by our own people's government, but should take a positive attitude of support and assistance. Because we have realized from actual experience that the various principles of the people's government's tax policy are completely correct and in line with the interests of the vast majority of the people, and that the people's government's tax authorities are basically correct in the specific methods of implementing these policies.
    In this basic spirit, I cannot help but disagree with the attitude and views expressed in Mr. Wu Dangge's article "On Urban Industrial and Commercial Taxes" in the seventh issue of the Economic Weekly of Guangming Daily on August 19. Below, I will explain my arguments.
    (II)
    Based on the information I obtained from participating in the investigation work of the business income tax in Peiping Municipality this time, I would like to elaborate on the reasons why the collection of income tax adopts the method of democratic assessment and whether the burden on industrial and commercial households is too heavy (the five issues listed by Mr. Wu Dangge can be summarized into these central issues).
    In order to elaborate on these central issues, it is first necessary to understand how the collection work of business income tax in Peiping Municipality was launched and promoted.
    At the beginning of this collection of business income tax in Peiping Municipality, representatives of the industrial and commercial sector were invited to organize a Promotion Committee to plan and arrange the overall work. At the meeting, everyone unanimously agreed to set 2 million points as the total points for tax payment. This total number of points can only represent a hypothetical range of taxation, which is a kind of "point value," and does not determine the tax amount. Even if the proposed total number of points is several times more than 2 million points, the tax amount will not necessarily increase several times. If the proposed number of points is less than 2 million points, the tax amount will not necessarily decrease. Therefore, the amount of the proposed points has no great relationship with the tax amount. A basic key is that the people's government does not adopt coercive methods, nor arbitrarily determine the tax amount; instead, it is based on the specific situation and real affordability of each industry, through a long period of investigation and understanding and careful analysis and research, and through various large and small meetings, repeatedly adjusted, through discussion and assessment by industrial and commercial households, through repeated revisions and comparisons by industry associations and joint assessment committees, and then made a decision. At the same time, considering the policy, it also considered reductions and exemptions (the scope of reductions and exemptions in Peiping this time is quite broad), so the result may not be able to complete the task of 2 million points. Before the operating conditions and affordability of each merchant have been determined, it is impossible to determine the total tax amount. Moreover, some industrial and commercial households should be reduced or exempted, and individual losses should be taken care of. Therefore, it is difficult to determine the final actual collection number in advance. The responsible cadres of the people's government have repeatedly stated that there is no pre-determined amount of tax revenue that must be completed, but to be responsible to the people, to specifically grasp the leadership according to the actual situation, and to achieve the deserved result. Mr. Wu Dangge believes that this method "has more disadvantages than advantages," which is actually just an empty phrase starting from abstract theory. As for saying that this is "a nature of apportionment rather than a nature of taxation," that is really Mr. Wu's subjective arbitrariness and fabrication without asking about the facts. Secondly, there were originally two different opinions on the tax collection method: one advocated the method of typical investigation and democratic assessment; the other advocated the method of reporting and checking accounts without assessment. There is a principled difference between the two in terms of policy thinking. For example, there are more than 35,000 industrial and commercial households in Peiping City. If only relying on merchants' reports, it can be asserted that the vast majority of merchants will commit fraud. Even if there is a method of checking accounts as a backing, how many people can the tax bureau have to check accounts? Only a limited number of households will be checked? Those who are checked will be unlucky, and those who are not checked will benefit. This not only violates the tax policy of the people's government, but will also be dissatisfied with the masses, and encourage the psychology of tax evasion among industrialists and businessmen. Therefore, this method can only be effective when merchants consciously report truthfully, or when the management of industry and commerce is relatively complete, or when a general investigation is conducted. At present, it is actually impossible to carry out the work of general investigation and precise accounting, and it is equally not easy to achieve completeness in management. In this case, if it is advocated to adopt the method of reporting and checking accounts, it is tantamount to completely believing that merchants will consciously report and pay taxes truthfully, which is a bit too naive. The method of advocating typical investigation and democratic assessment is the only way to break through the key points and promote the overall situation. After obtaining the typical investigation materials, it is possible to more correctly understand the actual affordability of industrialists and businessmen, and to grasp the authenticity of the points with the typical investigation materials; and to grasp the authenticity of the surface with the method of democratic assessment. The combination of the two will make it possible to make taxation fair and reasonable. In Peiping City, which has not been liberated for long, the industrial and commercial situation is complicated, and the old consciousness of ordinary merchants is still very strong. In order to understand the actual situation of each household and make the burden fair and reasonable, it is obvious that relying on mass democratic assessment in combination with typical investigation is necessary. Mr. Wu Dangge admits that democratic assessment is "the fairest and most reasonable in principle," but believes that it is "rough and superficial" in method. This shows that Mr. Wu does not actually understand the principle of democratic assessment, nor does he understand the truth that democratic assessment must be combined with typical investigation. Of course, the more important issue is whether the burden is too heavy? According to the information from Tianjin's income tax collection, at the beginning of the deployment work, before even the business categories were formulated, most industrialists and businessmen shouted that the burden was too heavy, saying that they were operating at a loss and unable to bear it, and asked for reductions and exemptions; some were more honest, stating that their business was not good and their income was extremely small, and asked for reductions. They said: "Today is liberated, the government allows the people to speak, and should obey the opinions of the people, protect industry and commerce, and should not levy taxes, because once taxes are levied, industry and commerce will collapse." In fact, this is their distortion of "democracy" and a one-sided understanding of the policy of "protecting industry and commerce." When the tax bureau conducted a typical investigation, mobilized more realistic account books, and calculated the more realistic profit situation in real terms together with the accountants, and announced them one by one at the conference, the merchants' tone began to change, their understanding gradually improved, and finally the majority of industrialists and businessmen stood up to assist the people's government in completing the tax collection work. The situation in Peiping is quite similar to that in Tianjin. Here, I will extract a few households from the typical investigation materials of Peiping City, divided into different industries, and compare their due burden (based only on their declaration or accounts) with the actual number collected after assessment:
Industry and　　Based on account Rate　Taxable amount According to the Difference Percentage of
business name　checking or reporting　　　　　　　　　the thirty-seventh year　　　　　　　　actual collected to the
　　　　　　　　net income for the second　　　　　　　　actual collected assessment assessment

Huai Rentang

Secondly, recently, the pig bristle, cargo yard, and fur industries have had disputes over business categories, and they have been shouting heavily and refusing to give in. In order to find out the actual situation, a general account check was conducted, and the results are as follows:

　　　　Investigation Results
Industry and　　Pig Bristle Fur　Pig Bristle Fur Pig Bristle Fur Fur Fuxin Fur Yongxing
business name　Yard Fuxing　Yard Deyuan Yard Huacheng Cheng Yard
Assessed Category 355 points 308 points 95 points 300 points 90 points

Taxable Amount 4,746 catties 28,240 catties 861 catties 2,025 catties 600 catties
Converted Category 854 points 50,83 points 155 points 365 points 108 points

Decrease (-)
Percentage (+) 141% (+) 65% (+) 63% (+) 22% (+) 19%

From the above statistics, it can be fully seen that the burden of business income tax is really not heavy. Not only does it not exceed the affordability of industrialists and businessmen, but the distance from their due burden is still very far for most of them. As for the phenomenon of excessively light or heavy actual burden of individual industries or individual households, it is naturally due to negligence in the assessment, and the tax authorities have been or are helping them to correct and adjust. Mr. Wu Dangge has obviously only heard the shouts of some industrialists and businessmen, but has not deeply investigated the truth. Therefore, he repeated the shouts of some industrialists and businessmen, but he does not know that many facts tell us that many industrialists and businessmen cannot withstand deep investigation. Because they have developed a habit under the long-term oppression of feudal forces, imperialists, and bureaucratic capital in the past, they never tell the truth to others, even to their own industry, and they are unwilling to disclose the real business secrets. Making false accounts, engaging in top buying and top selling, over-reporting expenses, and collectively evading taxes were their "self-defense" methods in the past, but unfortunately they are still left to this day after liberation. In addition to legitimate business, engaging in secret transactions, speculation, and even engaging in business that violates government laws and regulations, competing for illegal income, cannot be fully investigated from the books alone! For example, the "back accounts" of three volumes found by the Peiping Branch of the People's Bank in the Yude Grain Bank in the city in early June contained transactions of reselling gold from January to June. In the accounts, coptis chinensis was used instead of gold, with a total of 20.76 taels of gold and 1,288 silver dollars collected, and 30.99 taels of gold and 1,108 silver dollars sold. For another example, according to the statistical materials of the cases cracked by the Joint Inspection Station of the Front Gate Railway Station from May 21 to August 23 for three months: among them, there were 1,178 cases of gold and silver, 86 cases of foreign currency, 125 cases of drugs, 4,474 cases of tax evasion, and 98 other cases. More than 85% of the total cases are committed by formal commercial firms. Here is another example, according to the typical investigation data of the tax authorities in the Northeast region on the collection of business tax:
Region Business Name Declared Amount (Net Profit) Investigated Amount Percentage of Tax Evasion
Songjiang Province Yixingyuan 1,490,000 117,652,000 94.65%
Chang County
Same Same Yilong 4,160,000 122,020,000 87.1%
Same Dongshuncheng Loss of 1,422,920 118,623,500 100%
Hejiang Province Dongxingxiang 7,976,890 1,514,090 81.9%
Fujin County
Jiamusi City Sanchengyong 3,072,040 2,410,890 80.1%

From just the above few available materials, it can be seen that the inside story of deception and tax evasion has exceeded our imagination! Of course, there are also figures in the industrial and commercial sector who have a clear political understanding and are honest and fair. Therefore, as long as the methods of democratic assessment and in-depth investigation are promoted, it will not be difficult to gradually understand the essence of the problem. People should never be shaken by certain shouts, but must analyze and criticize them well. Here, we must have a further understanding of the issue of the weight of the burden.

In the past, under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, a few large industrial and commercial households could pay less tax or no tax, and the burden of large households was not much different from that of small and medium-sized households, which increased the burden on small and medium-sized households in disguise. After liberation, this unreasonable phenomenon was eliminated, and the burden of large households was relatively increased compared with the past. On the surface, it is unfavorable to them, but in fact it is very fair and reasonable. As for the extra burden of many commercial firms giving gifts and bribes to tax officials due to rampant corruption and bribery during the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, it no longer exists at all after liberation. In addition, in the past, taxes were not calculated in real terms, and coupled with the devaluation of the Kuomintang's currency, general industrial and commercial households often delayed the payment of taxes, and then paid them when the pseudo-currency was devalued by dozens, hundreds, or even thousands of times. This method is of course impossible and should not exist in today's liberation. It can be seen that some people shouting that today's taxes in Peiping are "heavier" is not surprising. The times have changed, the people's power has broken all unreasonable systems, and the phenomena that were considered natural in the past are now not allowed. Is this not precisely reasonable?
    (III)
    The current tax collection method is undeniably only a transitional method, and there are still many areas that should be improved. However, the methods of improvement must also be conditional and step-by-step, and cannot be successful solely by enthusiasm and ideals. Mr. Wu Dangge's opinions and the feedback from industrial and commercial households still have some merits, and should attract the attention of the tax authorities and be studied. As for Mr. Wu Dangge himself, and other gentlemen who have the same views as Mr. Wu, I hope that they can also conduct a more in-depth investigation and research. When investigating and researching, you must be good at distinguishing between the majority and the minority, the main and the secondary, the truth and the false, and be careful not to be arbitrary. To be honest, no matter how good a policy is, it is difficult to guarantee that everyone will be satisfied! Don't be afraid of people shouting, but see who is shouting? How many people? What is the motive? What is the purpose?
    Mr. Chen Ziguang, chairman of the Sporting Goods Industry Association of this city, said in an article on the collection of income tax in this city on August 8: "The first unfair thing in the Kuomintang period was that the industrial and commercial enterprises of bureaucratic capital paid very little tax, and some did not pay tax at all. There were also large capitalists who paid less tax, especially speculative industrial and commercial enterprises who colluded with bureaucrats, who paid even less tax. But the taxes paid by the general legitimate industrial and commercial enterprises were really too heavy! The characteristics of Peiping after liberation that are different from the former Kuomintang era: those who did not pay taxes before now have to pay taxes. Those who make more money pay more, and those who make less money pay less. Businessmen only bear legitimate taxes, and no longer bear all kinds of miscellaneous expenses such as entertainment fees and sports fees." According to the person in charge of the Fine Fur Industry Association, "The disputes that occurred between individual industries in the process of taxation this time are not the problem of heavy taxes and unaffordability, but the imbalance in the burden. After adjustment, it is possible to achieve fairness and reasonableness." These can be said to represent the true opinions of the industrial and commercial sector on the issue of business income tax collection in Peiping this time. These opinions are fair. All existing shortcomings can be completely overcome. I would like to sincerely draw the attention of the relevant government departments and further strive to improve the future work.

　　谈北平市营利事业所得税
    ——并与伍丹戈先生商榷
    虹流
  　（一）
    北平市三十七年下半年度营利事业所得税目前正在征收中。工商户正忙于筹款、缴款，有的要求减免。个别持观望态度；税务当局正忙于解释说服、并调整各行业的业分，努力使负担公平合理。但，此项征收工作，显然还存在着若干困难与缺点。
    第一、调查研究工作还不够深入。对于各行业的户数和经营与盈利情况、负担能力等，了解尚嫌肤浅。特别是由于许多工商户积习未除，不愿报告真实情况，以致调查很感困难，不容易获得客观全面的正确材料。
    第二、组织领导不够健全。虽然有推选委员会和联合评议委员会等很好的组织形式，但仍不够健全。如由工商业界代表十人，政府机关及公营企业代表七人所组成的推选委员会开会不很多，有些问题没有共同仔细研究讨论，而联合评议委员会的委员，大部分是由旧行业公会理监事中互推出来的，百分之九十五以上是旧公会中的负责人，代表性还很不足，许多中、小的工商业户对于这个委员会还有不少意见。
    第三、评议工作还有偏向。税局的工作人员在帮助各小组进行评议工作中，有的犯了包办代替的毛病，未能充分发挥群众力量；有的不负责任，把评议工作完全交给公会理监事或小组长，任他自行分配业分，迹近摊派，形成放任自流现象，致使一方面发生有的行业内部大、中、小户负担不平衡的情况；另一方面又形成有的行业与行业间负担不平衡的现象。如：百货业本身负担比较合理，但与银行、钱庄、布业相较，则他们的负担就显得较重。又如：米面粮业与煤栈、煤铺同业是生活必需品的营业，但煤栈、煤铺业的甲级户，还不如米面粮的中等户负担大。营业性质差不多的纸张文具业与书业相较，书业是显然的轻些。另外，因片面强调工轻于商的原则，以致有的营业情况相等的工业户与商业户负担悬殊过大。诸如此类的情形，都是这一次评议工作的缺点。
    但是，上述这些缺点，在北平这样一个新解放的大城市说来，在第一次征收中，实在是不可避免的。这在今后是完全可以克服与纠正的。因此，我们对于人民自己的政府第一次举办营利事业所得税是不应该抱着吹毛求疵的态度，而应该抱着积极赞助与支持的态度。因为我们从实际体验中已经认识到人民政府的税收政策的各项原则是完全正确的，合乎最大多数人民的利益，而人民政府的税收机关，在执行这些政策的具体方法上，基本上也是正确的。
    在这个基本精神上，使我对于八月十九日光明日报的经济周刊第七期上伍丹戈先生所撰“论城市工商税捐”一文所持的态度与观点不能不表示异议，下面我将说明我的论点。
    （二）
    根据我参加此次北平市营利事业所得税的调查工作所得的资料，愿将所得税的征收为什么要采取民主评议的方式和工商户的负担是否过重的问题为中心（伍丹戈先生所列举的五个问题，归纳起来也不外乎这些中心问题），加以阐述：
    为了阐述这些中心问题，首先还必须明了北平市营利事业所得税的征收工作是怎样展开与推进的。
    北平市这次征收营利事业所得税一开始就邀集了工商业界代表，组织推进委员会，计划布置全盘工作，在会议上大家一致意见，拟定二百万分，为纳税的总分。这个总分数只能代表征税的一个假定范围，也就是一种“点数”，对税额并不能发生决定性的作用，即便拟定的总分数比二百万分再多几倍，税额也不一定就要增加几倍，比二百万分拟的再少一些，税额也不一定就会减少，所以拟定分数的多寡与税额是没有好大关系的。一个基本关键是人民政府不采取强迫命令方式，不武断地拟定税额；而是根据各个行业具体情况和真实负担能力，经过长时间的调查了解和缜密的分析研究，并经过各种大小会议，反复进行调整，经过工商业户讨论评议，经过行业公会、联合评议会纵横比较多次修正，然后才做决定。同时又照顾政策斟酌减免（北平这次减免的范围是相当宽阔的），所以结果未必能完成二百万分的任务。当着各商户的营业情况和负担能力还没有查明之前，根本不能确定总的税额，况且还有的工商户应予减免，个别遭遇亏蚀的应予照顾，因此，事先很难确定最后的实征数字。人民政府的负责干部曾再三说明，预先根本没有内定必须完成多少税收任务的数额，而是要对人民负责，根据实际情况，具体掌握领导，而达成应得的结果。伍丹戈先生认为这种办法“弊多于利”，实际上只是从抽象理论出发的一句空话。至于说这是“摊派性质而不是捐税性质”，那实在是伍先生不问事实的主观武断和捏造。其次，在征税方法上，本来存在着两种不同的意见：一种是主张典型调查、民主评议的办法；另一种是主张申报查帐不用评议的办法。这两者，在政策思想上是有原则区别的。例如：北平城厢有三万五千多工商户，如果只凭商人申报，可以断言，绝大多数商户会发生欺瞒现象。就算还有查帐的方法作后盾吧，究竟税局能有多少人去查帐呢？抽查有限的户数吧？查到的就倒了霉，查不到的就沾了光，这样不仅违背人民政府的税收政策，亦必为群众所不满，助长工商业者漏税的心理。因此，这种办法，只有在商人完全自觉实报，或工商业的管理比较完备，或在普遍调查的情况下，才能收到成效。目前普遍调查及精密核帐的工作，事实上是做不到的，管理上同样也不容易做到完备。在这种情况下，如果主张采取申报查帐的方法就无异于完全相信商人会自觉的实报纳税，想法未免过于天真。主张典型调查、民主评议的办法，则是突破重点，推动全面的唯一办法。在取得了典型调查材料之后，就可以比较正确地了解工商业者的实际负担能力，以典型调查的资料来掌握点的真实性；加以民主评议的方法来掌握面的真实性，两者互相结合，就有可能使税收做到公平合理。在解放不久的北平市，工商业情况复杂，一般商人的旧意识仍很浓厚，为了明了各户实际情况，使负担公平合理，与典型调查相结合，必须依靠群众性的民主评议这是显而易见的。伍丹戈先生承认民主评议“在原则上是最公平合理的”，而在方法上认为它是“粗枝大叶”。这说明伍先生实际上并不了解民主评议的原则，更不了解民主评议必须与典型调查相结合的道理。当然，更重要的问题还在于负担究竟是否过重？根据天津征收所得税的资料，在布置工作的开始，连业分都尚未拟定之前，多数工商业者就呼叫过重，都说营业亏损，无力负担，要求减免；也有比较老实一些的，陈述营业不佳，所得极微，要求减轻。他们说：“今天解放了，政府允许老百姓讲话，就应当服从老百姓的意见，保护工商业，就不应当征税，因为一征税，工商业就垮台。”实在讲，这是他们对“民主”的曲解，和对“保护工商业”政策认识的片面性。及至税务局经过典型调查，动员出比较真实的帐册，会同管帐先生，折实计算获得比较真实的盈利情况，在大会上一一发表以后，商人的话锋才开始转变，认识逐渐提高，终于使大多数工商业者起来协助人民政府完成了税收工作。北平的情形与天津也颇有相似之处。我在这里，且把北平市的典型调查材料，分别不同行业，抽出几户来，就他们应得负担（仅根据他们的申报或帐目）与评议后实征数目作一比较：业别及　　根据查帐或申 税率　应征税　根据评议　差数　占应负担商户名称　报三十七年下　　　　　款数目　　分数实征　　的百分比

    从上面的统计数字可以充分看出，营利事业所得税的负担确实并不算重，不但没有超过工商业者的负担能力，而且距离他们应有的负担，多数还差得很远。至于个别行业或个别户的实际负担产生了畸轻畸重的现象，自是评议中的疏忽所致，税务当局已经或正在帮助他们进行纠正与调整。伍丹戈先生显然只听到某些工商户的叫喊，而未深入考察真相，因此就重复了某些工商户的叫声，殊不知有许多事实告诉我们，有不少工商业者是经不起深入的考察的。由于他们过去长期在封建势力帝国主义者及官僚资本的压榨下养成了一种习惯，不但对别人，就是对本行本业也从不肯吐露实话，真帐不肯公开，宁可信口对天盟誓，却不愿暴露真实的营业内幕。造假帐、顶买顶卖、多报开支、集体偷税，在过去曾是他们不得已的“自卫”手段，但不幸还遗留到解放后的今日。在正当营业之外，进行暗中交易，投机倒把，甚至经营违犯政府法令的生意，竞逐不法收益，更不是仅从帐簿上可以完全查考的了！如：人民银行北平分行六月初在本市裕德粮栈查出的“后帐”三册，内载一至六月份捣卖黄金的交易。帐中以黄连代替黄金，计收进黄金二○、七六两，银元一、二八八枚，售出黄金三○、九九两，银元一、一○八枚。又如，据前门车站联合检查所五月二十一日至八月二十三日三个月间破获案件的统计材料：其中金银案一、一七八件，外币八十六件，毒品一二五件，偷漏税款四、四七四件，其他九八件，在全部案件中有百分之八十五以上是属于正式商号之所为，再举一例，根据东北区税务当局发表征收营业税的典型调查资料：地区　商号名称　申报额（纯益）　　调查额　　　　　偷漏百分比松江省义兴源　　一、四九○、　　一一七、六五　百分之九四·六五常县　　　　○○○　　　　　二、○○○同上　同义隆　　四、一六○、　一二二、○二　　百分之八七·一

　　　　　　　　　　○四○　　　　　八九○
    仅从以上少数手头资料，便可以看出欺骗与逃税的黑幕，实已超出我们的想象了！当然在工商业者中，也不无政治认识清楚、诚实公正的人物，因此，只要发扬民主评议和深入调查的方法，就不难逐渐了解问题的实质。人们决不应该被某些叫喊所动摇，而必须很好地分析批判。在这里，我们对于负担的轻重问题必须有进一步的认识。
    在过去国民党反动统治下，少数大的工商户可以少纳税或不纳税，大户与中小户的负担相差不大，即变相地把负担加重在中、小户身上，解放后，铲除了这种不合理的现象，大户的负担，比较过去是相对的增加了，表面上对他们不利，实际上却是非常公平合理的。至于在国民党反动统治时期，因贪污贿赂公行，许多商号赠送与贿赂税吏的额外负担，解放后就完全不存在了。此外，过去税款不是折实计算，加以国民党的通货贬值，一般工商户往往滞交税款，待伪币贬值到几十倍几百倍甚至几千倍时再交，这种办法在解放后的今天当然是不可能也不应有了。由此可见，今天北平的税捐，有人喊叫“重了”是不足为奇的。时代是改变了，人民的力量打碎了一切不合理的制度，过去认为当然的现象，现在则是不可允许的，这难道不正是合理的吗？

    目前的征税方法，不可否认的，还只是过渡的办法，应该改善的地方还很多。但是，改善的办法也必须是有条件的，有步骤的，而不是单凭热情、理想所能成功的。伍丹戈先生的意见以及工商业者的反映，都还有可取的部分，应引起税务机关的注意，加以研究。而伍丹戈先生自己，以及与伍先生有同样观点的其他先生们，我希望也能再深入考察研究一番。在调查研究时，必须善于区别多数与少数、主要与次要、真象与假象，慎勿武断。老实说，任何好的政策，也难保证每一个人都满意的！不要怕人叫喊，但要看叫喊的是什么人？多少人？动机是什么？目的是什么？
    本市体育用品业公会理事长陈子光先生八月八日所写的一篇对本市征收所得税的文章中说过：“国民党时期第一个不公平的：是官僚资本的工商业有的纳税特少，有的根本不纳税。还有的大资本家纳税少，尤其是与官僚勾结的投机倒把的工商业者，所纳的税更少。可是普遍正当的工商业者，所纳的税实在太重了！北平解放后，与前国民党时代不同的特点：以前不纳税的，现在也得纳税。赚钱多的多纳，赚钱少的少纳。商民只负担正当税款，不另负担一切交际费、运动费等杂项款了。”据细毛皮货业公会负责人谈：“这次课税过程中，个别行业间所发生的争执，不是税重负担不起的问题，而是负担上的不平衡。经过调整，是可以达到公平合理的地步。”这些可以说是代表工商界对北平此次征收营利事业所得税问题的真实意见，这些意见是公允的。一切现存的缺点都是完全可以克服的。愿以忠诚态度，提起政府有关部门的注意，进一步努力改进今后的工作。
