  　III. Striving for Hegemony in China (Continued XVII)

　　In the short span of 1928-1929, the United States obtained many new rights from Chiang Kai-shek, and the Chiang government was almost entirely Americanized in appearance! In 1928, American man, Moffett Curleege, obtained the "consultant" position for the Huangpu Port Construction Project and participated in Chiang Kai-shek's military department. In February 1929, American man, Clever, obtained the position of "Director of Financial Advisors." Prior to this, American man, Gamewell, had obtained the position of Chairman of the Design Committee of the Ministry of Finance and concurrently served as a specialist member of the Banking and Currency System, participating in Chiang Kai-shek's finances. In May of the same year, American man, Mantel, became a railway "advisor," participating in Chiang Kai-shek's land transportation. William Roda, representative of the American Aviation Development Company, also signed the Sino-American Air Mail Service Contract with Chiang Kai-shek, obtaining all rights to the three major air routes of Shanghai-Hankou, Beijing-Ping, and Shanghai-Guangdong, manipulating Chiang Kai-shek's aviation. Americans Lin Baik and Miller even obtained the position of "National Government Advisor" (Note: *Oriental Magazine*, Vol. 25, No. 24, Vol. 26, No. 7, Vol. 26, No. 12, Vol. 27, No. 21, Vol. 28, No. 7; *Guowen Weekly*, Vol. 6, No. 21, Vol. 7, No. 14 and *The Shanghai Shenbao Yearbook* of the 22nd year. All original sources of personal names not attached to the original text have been omitted. Also, the Sino-American aviation contract was later changed due to opposition from other forces, with the United States nominally contributing 45% of the total capital of 10 million, still playing a manipulative role.) participating in the "central" leadership organs of Chiang Kai-shek. This was an intolerable stimulus for Japan. In 1930, Japan instigated another split movement led by Wang Jingwei, while the United States still supported Chiang Kai-shek to suppress it. This was the so-called "Enlarged Conference" and the Chiang-Yan-Feng War. Britain also joined Japan's side because its interests in China were threatened by the United States. Seeing that the other side was coming on fiercely, the United States gave Chiang Kai-shek various kinds of assistance, first supporting Soong Tzu-wen in issuing large amounts of public bonds, so that Chiang Kai-shek could use money to encourage and buy off the soldiers who were carrying out massacres for the United States, such as the "National Government" issuing a "reward" of 200,000 yuan on August 16 to Jiang Guangnai's division, which first entered Jinan, and on August 22, Chiang ordered that whoever first occupied Gongxian would be "rewarded" with 200,000 yuan, and whoever first occupied Luoyang or Zhengzhou would be "rewarded" with 1 million yuan... American planes and aviation personnel then directly participated in the Chiang army's operations. In August and September, Japan boldly organized a "National Government" in Beiping by Wang Jingwei, Yan Xishan, etc., confronting the American Nanjing government. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs also publicly stated that "if problems occur within its sphere of influence, they will be resolved diplomatically with the new government authorities." Around this time, the United States also publicly advocated organizing a joint army of 200,000 with US$500 million as military expenses to assist Chiang Kai-shek in "suppressing the rebellion." Finally, the United States skillfully used Zhang Xueliang, a special force, to help Chiang Kai-shek suppress Wang Jingwei and others. (Note: *Oriental Magazine*, issues 27 and 36. On April 4, 1930, Yan Xishan went to the Northeast, and representative Wen Shouquan brought Zhang Xueliang's handwritten letter back to Taiyuan. Wen said: "The reason why the Northeast has not expressed its position on the current situation is entirely due to diplomatic relations." Later, Yan and Wang proposed to Zhang Xueliang that the permanent cession of Chahar, Suiyuan, Pingjin, and half of the ministers in Beiping be placed under Zhang's control as conditions for asking Zhang for assistance, but this was not carried out, naturally because the United States' "diplomatic relations" in the Northeast were victorious.) This was the second time the American unification movement had achieved results.

　　美国侵华史

  　三　争夺中国霸权　（续十七）
    一九二八——二九短短两年中美国又从蒋介石手中取得许多新的权利，蒋政府在外表上也几乎成了青一色的美国货！一九二八年美国人茂非古力治获得黄浦筑港工程“顾问”，参与蒋介石的军事部门，一九二九年二月美国人克未勒获得财政“顾问主任”；前此又有美国人甘梅尔获得财政部设计委员会主席兼银行币制专门委员，参与蒋介石的财政；同年五月又有美国人满台尔为铁路“顾问”，参与蒋介石陆上交通；美国航空发展公司代表芮伯（Ｗｉｌｌｉａｍ　Ｒｏｄａ）又与蒋介石订立中美航空邮务合同，取得沪汉、京平、沪粤三条主要航线全部权利，操纵蒋介石的航空；美国人林百克及密勒更获得“国民政府顾问”（注：东方杂志二五卷二四号，二六卷七号，二六卷一二号、二七卷二一号、二八卷七号，国闻周报，六卷二一期、七卷一四期及二十二年申报年鉴所有人名原出处未附原文者从略，又美蒋航空合同，后因别种势力反对，改变为美国名义上出资本总数一千万的百分之四十五，仍起操纵作用。）位置，参与蒋介石的“中枢”领导机关。这对日本是无可忍耐的刺激，一九三○年日本策动一个由汪精卫出面的又一次分裂运动，美国则仍由蒋介石予以镇压，这就是所谓“扩大会议”和蒋、阎冯战争。英国也因在华利益受到美国威胁，加入了日本一边。美国鉴于对方来势凶猛，曾给蒋介石各种援助，先支持宋子文大发公债，使蒋介石好拿金钱来鼓励和收买替美国进行屠杀的将士，如八月十六日“国民政府”发出“赏金”二十万，给首入济南的蒋光鼐师，八月二十二日蒋下令先占巩县者“赏”洋二十万元，先占洛阳或郑州者“赏”洋百万元………。美国飞机和航空人员继又直接参加蒋军作战。八九月间日本索兴由汪精卫阎锡山等组织北平“国民政府”，与美国南京政府对峙，日本外务省还公开表示“如在该势力圈内发生之问题，事实上即与新政府当局以外交折冲解决之”。美国也就在此前后公开主张以美金五万万元作军费组织联军二十万协助蒋介石“平乱”。最后美国又巧妙地运用张学良这个特殊势力帮助蒋介石把汪精卫等压下去。（注：东方杂志二七、三六各期，一九三○年四月四日阎锡山赴东北代表温寿泉赉张学良亲笔函返太原，温云：“东北对时局问题所以未有表示之原因，全系外交关系。”后来阎汪曾以察绥平津永久让与张学良及北平各部长半数归张支配为条件，请张援助，均未行，自然是美国在东北“外交关系”胜利。）这是美国统一运动的第二次收到效果。
