　　Tangshan Power Plant
　  Overhauls Machinery and Boilers to Reduce Coal Consumption
    [Reported by this newspaper] All staff and workers of the Tangshan Power Plant, under the North China Electric Power Company, responded to the call for "Saving Coal and Reducing Costs" by overhauling machinery and boilers and improving working methods, resulting in a significant reduction in coal consumption. During the period of Japanese imperialist occupation, the boilers and machines of this power plant were never properly repaired due to reckless use. The condensers and boiler tubes were heavily scaled, and the economizers and air preheaters were clogged with soot. As a result, the machine that was originally able to generate 15,000 kilowatts, could only generate 4,000 kilowatts in the summer, and the coal consumption reached more than one kilogram per kilowatt-hour. After the liberation of Tangshan, at the Tangshan Temporary Workers' Representative Conference in March, worker Geng Liantai from the boiler room proposed the slogan "Saving Coal and Reducing Costs," which immediately received a response from all staff and workers. During the "Red May" labor competition this year, the machinery and boilers were thoroughly overhauled, the water pipes and economizers were cleaned, and the half-inch of scale on the outside of the pipes was completely removed, greatly improving efficiency. As a result, coal consumption decreased from 0.93 kilograms in January of this year to 0.818 kilograms recently. The plant is currently actively researching ways to further reduce coal consumption.

### 唐山发电所　检修机炉减少燃煤

　　唐山发电所
　  检修机炉减少燃煤
    【本报讯】华北电业公司所属唐山发电所全体职工响应“省煤节约，减低成本”的号召，检修机炉，改进工作方式，煤耗量已有显著减低。该发电所在日本帝国主义侵占时期，由于拼命的使用，锅炉机器从未好好修理，复水器和锅炉管内水垢积结很厚，省煤器和空气预热器，为烟灰堵塞。因此发电一万五千千瓦的机器，后来一到夏天只能发电四千千瓦，而当时煤耗量竟达每度电消耗煤一公斤以上。唐山解放后，三月里唐山临时职工代表大会上，锅炉房工友耿连泰提出“省煤节约，减低成本”的口号，立即获得全体职工的响应。今年红五月的劳动竞赛中，又将机炉彻底修理了一回，将水管和省煤器洗刷干净，将管子外面积到半英寸的灰垢，完全擦掉，效率大大提高，因之煤耗量由今年一月的○·九三公斤，逐月下降至最近的○·八一八公斤。目前该所正积极研究使煤耗继续降低的办法。
