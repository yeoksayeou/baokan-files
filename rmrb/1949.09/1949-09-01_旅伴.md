　　Part One Night
　　Chapter Two Lina
　　"They're all beautiful girls," he sighed.
　　"Why," Lina asked, "can't you get along with any of them?"
　　He didn't answer and began to whistle. He whistled very well, not like the children on the street. "This is a passage from Tchaikovsky's Fourth Symphony," he explained when he finished whistling. Later, he asked Lina if she liked poetry, and he recited a poem by Aseyev: "No, you're not affectionate to me at all, good friends aren't like this." This poem moved her; she had never heard such a poem before, she only knew a little poetry from her seventh-grade textbook. He knew so much more, and he could recite it anytime, day or night. They often sat until late at night. She felt like seeing him, listening to him recite… But once, in his room, he recited "Gypsies" to her, and when he reached the last line: "Everywhere is destined passion, but one cannot escape the play of fate," when he finished reciting this line, he said in that same beautiful tone of his, "I love you," and then kissed her lips with those moist, smoky lips. She jumped up and pushed him hard, sending the back of the skinny, malaria-ridden man crashing into the door.
　　"You're strong!" he said after a moment of silence.
　　She stood, stretched her body, clenched her small fists, and then walked past him with brisk steps, not even looking at him as she went straight out.
　　She returned to her room and rinsed her mouth. But she didn't think that was enough. She brushed her teeth with toothpaste again. She felt as if she had swallowed something dirty.
　　Then the demon of love descended.
　　No one had ever been like this before.
　　"Kiss me…"
　　Who else had ever been kissed like this?
　　"Sleep, little one. Isn't it unsteady for you to rest on my arm?"
　　Who else have you loved like this?
　　"Kiss me…"
　　For the first time in her life, she had her own home. It was only one room in total, but, heavens, how much furniture was in the room! There was a wardrobe with a mirror, a clumsy-legged table that opened and closed at will, a desk, a sofa, and chairs! In the kitchen, she even had a cupboard filled with tableware. All of this belonged to her, and she belonged to Danila, what a beautiful name! In her twenties, she had never belonged to anyone, but now she walked with a rapturous heart, arm in arm with her legal husband.
　　She thought he was old: he was already twenty-eight years old. She was very happy that he was not too young: in her opinion, this added a lot of dignity to her.
　　He liked to give her gifts: she accepted every tiny object with infinite joy! "I've never had slippers like these," she said. "I've never had clothes like these." And he, deeply moved, would reply:
　　"My dear, you should have ten such clothes…"
　　Even a simple piece of chocolate, she ate with such relish that it was a pleasure to watch her.
　　She wore an apron and took care of the housework, with an expression as if she had never done anything else in her life but take care of the housework.
　　Life was completely happy and fulfilling. Love transformed Lina: her way of walking was different now, and the posture of her shoulders was also different than before. Her voice was also low and delicate. Her eyes became dark and narrow. Her face was filled with a dignified and victorious glow, and people on the street often looked back at her, which added to her dignity and victory.
　　Ten months passed like this. Ten months—that's three hundred days, three hundred nights.
　　He was immediately drafted.
　　It was a terrible day. She saw for the first time that she was not the most important thing in his life.
　　He was rushing around the house, packing his things, answering her questions absentmindedly…
　　She wasn't blaming him. The problem wasn't about blaming. She was just recognizing him from this perspective for the first time.
　　The most important thing in his life was a man's career, and that career was calling him now. He hadn't left yet, but he no longer belonged to her.
　　It couldn't be otherwise. He covered his face with his hands. If it weren't like this, she wouldn't love him.
　　No, she wouldn't stop loving him—she couldn't stop loving him; but her dignity and victory might lose their luster. She was an athlete, a heroine, a champion in sports competitions, she understood these things. Only defeating the strong counts as victory. What glory is there in conquering a weak heart? His heart was strong. She was proud of this.
　　She should let him understand that she understood all of this. Let him be satisfied and go to war.
　　First, she had to hide her disappointment. He was very self-controlled—he was ordinary and calm. He told jokes. She could do that too.
　　She should help him pack. Like a guest, she sat down with her hands in her sleeves. He stuffed a shirt into his duffel bag, and she remembered that the shirt was missing a button.
　　"Wait a moment, Danila, let me do it."
　　She took the shirt out of the duffel bag, checked it all over, and mended it. She packed dry food—not much, he instructed. She reminded him to bring a small washbasin and a shaving brush. Also shoe polish and a clothes brush. She packed him envelopes, stationery, and matches.
　　He sat and watched her pack his things. This was how it should be: when the wife packs her husband's luggage for war, he sits down, smokes, and rests.
　　When the things were packed, he went to her to say a tender farewell, she put his head on her chest, and gazed at his face with a new feeling—a new feeling of heartbreaking, boundless intimacy and tenderness.
　　She became his sister, his mother, and, as before, his lover. She was everything to him in this world.
　　She sent him to the station and said goodbye to him without tears. He asked her: (To be continued)

    第一部　夜
    第二章　琳娜
    “都是美不过的女孩子呵，”他叹了一口气说。
    “为什么呢，”琳娜问道，“你同她们连一个也过不来吗？”
    他没回答就啸起来了。他啸得非常好听，完全不象街上的孩子们啸的。“这是卡柯夫斯基（注一）的第四交响曲中的一段，”他啸完了的时候解释说。后来他问琳娜喜欢诗不喜欢，他背了一首阿塞耶夫（注二）的诗：“不，你对我完全不亲热，好朋友不是这样儿的。”这诗感动了她，她从来还没听过这样的诗呢，她只是在学校七年级的课本里知道一点诗。他知道的多着呢，而且无论昼夜，什么时候都可以把它背出来。他们常常坐到夜阑人静的时分。她感觉着想见他，听他朗诵……可是有一次在他房间里，他给她朗诵着茨冈（注三），当背到最后一行：“处处都是命定的＠情，可是逃不脱命运的玩弄”当他背完这句的时候，就用那同样美丽的自己的音调说：“我爱你，”于是就用那温润的，发着一股烟味的嘴唇，在她的口上吻起来了。她跳起来，猛力的把他一推，推得这位枯瘦的疟疾鬼的脊背撞到门上。
    “真有力！”他沉默了一会。
    她站着，把身子一伸，握着小拳头，然后用轻快的脚步，从他身边走过去，对他一眼也不看的就一直出去了。
    她回到自己的房间里，漱了漱嘴。可是这她还觉得不够呢。她又用牙粉刷了刷牙。她觉得她好象吞了什么脏东西似的。
    于是情魔就光临了。
    这样谁也不曾有过呢。
    “吻我一下吧……”
    这样还吻过谁呢？
    “睡你的吧，小东西。你枕在我胳膊上不牢稳吗？”
    你还这样爱过谁呢？
    “吻我一下吧……”
    她生平第一次有了自己的家了。这总共只有一间屋子，可是，天呵，房间里有多少家具呵！有带镜子的衣橱，有随意开合的粗腿的桌子，有写字台，有沙发，有椅子！厨房里她还有装着食具的柜厨呢。这一切都是属于她的，而她是属于达尼拉的，会有这样漂亮的名字呵！二十来岁她都没属于任何人，而现在她带着狂喜的心情，挽着合法的丈夫的臂膊走着。
    她认为他是上了年纪的人：他已经二十八岁了。她很高兴他已经并不太年轻：据她的意见看来，这给她添了不少庄严。
    他喜欢给她送礼物：每一种极小的物件，她都带着无限的欢欣去接受它！“我从来没有过这样的拖鞋，”她说道。“我从来没有过这样的衣服。”于是深深感动了的他，就回答着：
    “亲爱的，你应该有十件这样的衣服呢……”
    就连一块普通的巧克力糖，她都如此津津有味的吃着，不由得令人怀着快感望着她。
    她束着围裙，料理着家务，她那种神情，好象她一生什么旁的事都不作，就是料理家务似的。
    生活完全是幸福而美满的。爱情把琳娜改造了：她现在的走路的风度是另样儿的，双肩的姿势也不同以前了。声音也是低微而娇憨的。她的眼睛变黑变窄了。她满面带着庄严而胜利的光辉，街上人们都频频对她回顾着，这会加了她的庄严与胜利呢。
    这样过了十个月。十个月——这是三百天，三百夜呵。
    他立即被征调了。
    这是一个可怕的日子。她第一次看出来在他的生活里居第一位的不是她。
    他在屋里乱忙着，收拾着自己的东西，心不在焉的回答着她的发问……
    她并不见怪。问题并不在见怪上。她不过第一次的从这方面认识了他。
    在他生活里居第一位的是一种男子的什么事业，而这事业此刻在号召他了。他还没有走，可是他已经不是属于她的了。
    不能不是这样呢。他用手遮住脸。假如不是这样的话，她会不爱他了。
    不，她不会不爱他的——不能不爱的；可是她的庄严与胜利，许会失掉光彩呢。她是一个运动员，是女豪杰，是运动会上夺得锦标的人，她明白这些事情呢。只有战胜强者才算是胜利。征服懦弱的心，这该有多么光荣呢？他的心是刚强的。这她是引为自傲的。
    她应该如何让他明白这一切，她是都明白的。让他满意她而去出征呢。
    首先她必须遮掩着自己的失望。他很能自持呢——他平平常常，泰然自若的。他说着笑话。她也能这样呢。
    应当帮助他来整理行装呢。就象当客似的，她袖手旁观的坐下来。他把一件衬衣往行军袋里塞着，她想起衬衣上没有扣子。
    “等一会，达尼拉，我来吧。”
    她把衬衣从行军袋里掏出来，统统检查了一遍，修补了一番。她收拾了干粮——不多，他嘱咐要这样的。她提醒着叫带上小水盘和刮脸刷。还有鞋油和衣服刷子。她给他装了信封，信纸及火柴。
    他坐着看她给他装东西。这也是应该这样的：当太太替他整顿行装出征的时候，他坐下抽着烟，休息着。
    当东西收拾好了的时候，他走到她跟前作温存的告别，她把他的头放到自己的胸上，含着一种新的情感——含着令人裂心的那种无限亲昵与温存的新的情感，凝视着他的面孔。
    她成了他的姊妹，成了他的母亲，就如同从前似的，成了他的情人了。她是他的人间的一切。
    她把他送到车站上，毫无眼泪的同他告了别。他对她问道：　（未完）
