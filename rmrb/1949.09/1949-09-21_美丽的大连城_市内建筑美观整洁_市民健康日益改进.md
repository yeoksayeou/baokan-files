Xinhua News Agency, Dalian, 20th—Dalian, which once suffered greatly under Japanese imperialist oppression, is now a clean, beautiful, and healthy city. On the eve of their surrender, the Japanese imperialists wantonly destroyed Dalian. In terms of transportation alone, they dismantled the rails of three tram lines, and most of the city's iron poles and traffic signs were taken away. The streets and alleys were filled with air-raid shelters, and garbage was piled up everywhere. However, thanks to the efforts of the local people's government and the assistance of the Soviet garrison over the past four years, the city's devastation has been completely restored. Over the past four years, Dalian has paved and repaired more than 883,000 square meters of urban roads, renovated and repaired 18 bridges including Taibai Bridge and Weihai Bridge, excavated more than 15,000 mud wells, and cleared more than 3,900 cubic meters of accumulated soil in the city. The city's larger Zhude Square, Democracy Square, and other squares have been renovated and tidied up, and a beautiful fountain named "September 3rd" has been built in Zhongshan Square. Labor Park and Luxun Park, which were originally dilapidated, have become shady, clean, and comfortable due to the active construction by workers and citizens participating in voluntary labor. In addition to planting trees and flowers in Labor Park, the "May 1st" Tower, the Labor Hero Hall, and the Museum Exhibition Hall have been built, and a children's education hall is currently under construction. Luxun Park is mainly a place for children to play and rest, with various animals, poultry, and electric wooden horses and other children's toys, as well as a children's library. Many children happily spend their holidays and extracurricular time here. In order to improve the appearance of the city, more than 100,000 trees of various kinds were planted in the city in the first half of this year. Due to the recovery and development of production, more than 17,000 households in the city have repainted their facades, and more than 1,600 households have reinstalled door and window glass. More than 5,000 street lights have been newly installed on the main streets, making Dalian even more beautiful. Not only is the city's appearance becoming more and more beautiful, but the health of the citizens is also improving day by day. The city's health bureau has vigorously carried out various epidemic prevention work in the past six months. This year, 80% of school-age children have been vaccinated against smallpox, and more than 70% of the city's population has been vaccinated against cholera in the summer. The incidence of infectious diseases has been rapidly decreasing over the years. In 1946, 1,160 people suffered from various infectious diseases, which had been reduced to 69 people last year. Dalian's development can also be seen from the following figures: compared with the same period last year, the construction funds used for various construction projects in the first half of this year increased by 142%, health funds increased by 333%, and cultural and educational funds increased by 144%.

　　美丽的大连城
  　市内建筑美观整洁
  　市民健康日益改进
    【新华社大连二十日电】曾受尽日寇蹂躏的大连，现在已成为一座整洁美丽健康的都市。日寇在投降前夕，曾对大连滥施破坏，仅在交通方面就拆毁了三条电车线路的铁轨，全市大部分铁制的电杆和交通标帜，都被拆走。街头巷尾挖满了防空壕，到处堆积着垃圾。但是四年来，由于当地人民政府的努力建设以及苏联驻军帮助，这座城市的满目疮痍，已完全平复了。四年来，大连共铺设和补修市内道路八十八万三千余平方公尺，改造与补修了太白桥、卫海桥等十八座，掏挖溜泥井一万五千余个，清除市内积土三千九百余立方公尺。该市规模较大的朱德广场、民主广场等都经过重新修建和整理，中山广场上并修成命名为“九三”的一座美丽的喷水池。劳动公园和鲁迅公园，原来已残破不堪，由于全市职工和市民参加义务劳动，积极修建，已变得林木荫翳、整洁舒适了。劳动公园内除遍植林木花卉外，并建筑了“五一”塔、劳动英雄馆、博物陈列馆，现正修建儿童教育馆。鲁迅公园主要为儿童游息场所，内设各种动物、家禽及电气木马等儿童玩具，并有儿童图书馆。不少儿童在这里愉快地渡过他们的假期和课外时间。为了整理市容，今年上半年全市共栽植各种树木十万余棵。由于生产的恢复和发展，现全市又有一万七千余户油刷了门面，一千六百余户重新安置门窗玻璃，各主要街道上新设了五千余盏路灯，这些使大连越发变得美丽。不仅市容日益美观，市民健康情况亦日益改进。该市卫生局半年来曾大力进行了各项防疫工作，今年适龄儿童有百分之八十种了牛痘，夏季全市有百分之七十以上的人口进行了霍乱预防注射。传染病历年来迅速减少，一九四六年染患各种传染病者达一千一百六十人，去年就已减至六十九人。大连的发展，也可以从下列数字看出，今年上半年用于各种建设经费与去年同时期比较，建设经费增加了百分之一百四十二，卫生经费增加了百分之三百三十三，文化教育经费增加了百分之一百四十四。
