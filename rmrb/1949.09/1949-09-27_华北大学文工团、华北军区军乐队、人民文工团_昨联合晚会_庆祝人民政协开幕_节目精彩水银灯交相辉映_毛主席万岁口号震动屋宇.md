[Our Correspondent] Yesterday, the North China University Art Troupe, the North China Military Region Military Band, and the People's Art Troupe organized a joint evening gala, creating the first climax in celebrating the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC). After the People's Art Troupe's "Mihu" instrumental ensemble, the North China Military Region Military Band performed. "Cavalry March" sounded like ten thousand horses galloping; during the performance of "New Soldiers' March," people clearly heard the sounds of continuous artillery fire and intense charges, as if they were on the battlefield. The North China University presented "Long Live the People's Victory Grand Song and Dance," divided into eleven small segments. Simple and healthy, mostly adapted from folk songs and dances, it fully expressed the excellent spirit of our nation. In the "Red Flag Fluttering" marching dance, a soldier led the way carrying a military flag, followed by six soldiers wielding swords, acting as if charging on horseback. Several militiamen closely followed, with workers and peasants cheering along the road. As the heroic figures of the soldiers gradually receded into the distance, the welcoming crowd on stage and the audience applauded together, with thunderous applause. The "Presenting Flowers for Victory" section included "Walking with Flower Lanterns" and "Presenting Flower Dance," with five boys and five girls all dressed in colorful costumes. Their feet were covered with a huge lotus leaf, with four lotus flowers extending from the lotus leaf. They danced slowly, gracefully and movingly. Afterwards, four girls holding fresh flowers came out, singing together, offering "Unity Flowers" and "Victory Flowers" to Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, various democratic parties, and the CPPCC. The worker-peasant dance and border dance were extremely wonderful. The actors wore the national costumes of Han, Mongolian, Hui, Miao, Yi, Tibetan, and Taiwanese people, and danced together with workers, peasants, soldiers, students, and merchants, singing "Han, Mongolian, Hui, Miao, Yi, Tibetan, united as one, never separated," waving their fists forward to show their determination to thoroughly eliminate the reactionaries and liberate all of China. Afterwards, workers and peasants crossed axes and sickles to create a victory gate, and representatives of all ethnic groups and all strata of people passed through the gate in an orderly manner. The meaning of this program was: "All strata and all ethnic groups, united as one, form a democratic big family, break the iron chains of thousands of years, and let democratic China last forever." "Advancing Victoriously Under the Banner of Mao Zedong" was the final program, and also the largest song and dance. The People's Liberation Army led the way with red flags, closely followed by people from all strata and all ethnic groups, dancing in circles. The band played the song "The East is Red," and the words "Great Unity of the People" and "Long Live Chairman Mao" appeared on the stage. At this moment, a giant statue of Chairman Mao suddenly appeared before the people, with four Communist Party flags erected on both sides of the statue, and dozens of red lanterns arranged horizontally in front of the statue. The actors and the audience shouted "Long Live" in unison, with enthusiasm overflowing the entire venue. With the giant statue of Chairman Mao as the center, all the actors marched around the stage for several weeks, with the army, navy, air force of the People's Liberation Army and people from all strata and all ethnic groups advancing in turn. Red flags fluttered on the stage, and the mercury lights shone brightly, the whole venue cheered enthusiastically, and the applause was thunderous. After the meeting, Chairman Mao slowly came out, and was immediately surrounded by all the actors, the slogan "Long Live Chairman Mao" shook the building, and the applause was like surging tides. Chairman Mao smiled, raised his hands high, and applauded in response.

    庆祝人民政协开幕　节目精彩水银灯交相辉映
    毛主席万岁口号震动屋宇
    【本报专访】昨天华北大学文工团、华北军区军乐队和人民文工团组织联合晚会，在舞台上出现了庆祝人民政协的第一个高潮。人民文工团的“密胡”连奏之后，继由华北军区军乐队表演。“骑兵进行曲”如万马奔腾；“新战士进行曲”演出时，人们清楚地听到连天的炮火、激烈的冲锋的声音，俨若置身战场。华大演出“人民胜利万岁大歌舞”，内分十一个小节目。朴素、健康，多从民间歌舞改编而成，充分地表现了我们民族的优良气魄。题为“红旗飘扬”的进军舞一节，由一战士持军旗先导，六战士横刀奔驰，作策马冲锋状。几个民兵紧紧跟随，工农群众夹道欢送。当战士们的英姿渐行渐远的时候，台上迎送的群众和台下的观众一起鼓掌，声如雷鸣。“献花祝捷”一节包括“走花灯”和“献花舞”，五个男孩五个女孩都穿着彩色的衣裳，他们的脚上都覆盖着一个巨大的荷叶，荷叶上伸出四朵荷花。徐徐飘舞，委婉动人。以后又出来四个手持鲜花的女孩，一起唱着，把“团结花”、“胜利花”献给毛主席、朱总司令、各民主党派和人民政治协商会议。工农舞和边疆舞极为精彩，演员们穿着汉、蒙、回、苗、夷、藏及台湾人民的民族服装，和工、农、兵、学、商一起舞蹈，唱着“汉蒙回苗夷藏，团结一心不分离”的歌，全体挥拳前进，表示一定要彻底肃清反动派，解放全中国。之后，工人、农民以斧头镰刀交叉起来作成一个胜利门，各族人民和各阶层人民的代表者从门下鱼贯而过。这个节目的意思是：“各阶层各民族，团结一心，结成民主的大家庭，打断千年的铁锁链，民主中国万万年。”“在毛泽东的旗帜下胜利前进”是最后的一个节目，也是最大的一次歌舞。解放军手持红旗先导，各阶层各民族人民紧紧跟随，回旋舞蹈。乐队奏起“东方红”之歌，台上显出“人民大团结”、“毛主席万岁”的大字。这时，毛主席巨像突然出现在人们面前，巨像两旁竖起四面共产党党旗，像前横列数十盏红灯。演员和观众齐呼“万岁”，热情横溢于全场。以毛主席巨像为中心，全体演员绕舞台急行数周，解放军的陆军、海军、空军及各阶层、各民族的人民依次前进。台上红旗缤纷，水银灯光交相辉映，全场热情欢呼，掌声大作。会后，毛主席缓步出场，立即为全体演员所包围，“毛主席万岁”的口号震动屋宇，掌声如海涛汹涌奔腾。毛主席则满面笑容，高举双手，鼓掌相应。
