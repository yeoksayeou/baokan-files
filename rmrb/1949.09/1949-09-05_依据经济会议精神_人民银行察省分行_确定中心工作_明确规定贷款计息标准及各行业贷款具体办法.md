Chahar News: The People's Bank of Chahar Province Branch, based on the spirit of the Chahar Provincial Economic Conference, has determined that its central task is to support agricultural and industrial production, promote the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas, and support the export of local specialties. It will also actively absorb various deposits, strengthen turnover, actively redeem various old currencies, unify the currency market, and strengthen the management of gold and silver. In performing its tasks, it must adhere to the principle of "public first, private second, industry first, commerce second, and taking into account both public and private interests." The relationship between the bank and public and private industrial and commercial enterprises should be mutually beneficial, jointly promoting production development. At present, private deposit business in various places is extremely underdeveloped and should be actively absorbed and utilized. The thinking and style of looking down on small deposits, being unrealistic, and being timid in using funds to support production must be overcome. Specific regulations have also been made on loan interest rates, terms, methods, and approaches based on needs and the principle of supporting production. Agricultural and sideline product loans should mainly be based on payment and receipt of currency based on real value. For those who repay loans in currency, interest will be calculated at 7.5 to 15 percent (Note: General agricultural and sideline product loans are all over three months, and loans exceeding three months are required to be based on real value, and interest is calculated based on real value loans, so the provisions for agricultural loan currency interest are rarely applied in practice.). For loans based on real value, such as agricultural machinery factories and transportation equipment factories, iron or other raw materials will be calculated at an interest rate of 3 percent; water conservancy, livestock, fertilizers, and pesticides converted into rice will be calculated at an interest rate of 2 percent. Loans exceeding three months must be based on real value, and those willing to use real value for loans below three months are also acceptable. General agricultural loans should not exceed eight months, special loans such as fertilizers and pesticides one year, farms and livestock two years, and afforestation, waterwheels, wells, and canal construction three years. Sideline product loans should be three to five months. For short-term currency loans for handicrafts, the monthly interest rate is 9 to 15 percent, and for real value loans, the monthly interest rate is 0.5 to 1 percent. For state-owned industrial and mining enterprises and government production, the monthly interest rate is 6 to 12 percent, for private industrial enterprises, it is 9 to 15 percent. Loans exceeding three months are calculated on real value, and can be handled on a case-by-case basis when necessary. For state-owned commercial enterprises, the monthly interest rate is 7.5 to 15 percent, and for private commercial enterprises, it is 9 to 21 percent. The term should not exceed one month. For cooperative loans, for production cooperatives, loans repaid in currency will have a monthly interest rate of 6 to 12 percent, and real value loans will be 3 to 5 percent. For supply and marketing cooperatives, loans repaid in currency will have a monthly interest rate of 7.5 to 15 percent, and real value will be 3 percent. In principle, it should not exceed three months, and whether or not real value is used depends on the business being operated.

Loan methods and procedures: Production units should apply directly to the bank for loans based on their own business plans, opposing the method of subjective allocation by the bank. For agricultural and sideline product loans, the government will notify the county supply and marketing cooperatives based on the loan priorities, make specific plans, and report to the special district bank for review and receipt of funds. Cooperative loans should be based on business plans to apply for loans from the county sub-branch, and those without a county sub-branch should apply for loans from the special district bank. Cooperatives in Zhangjiakou, Xuanhua, and Datong cities should apply for loans locally at the business department. Handicraft loans should be made directly by handicraftsmen to local banks. Those without banks should apply for loans from cooperatives. Those who place orders should also be handled by cooperatives using the loan ordering method, in order to supply raw materials and promote the sale of finished products. When banks need to handle loan ordering, they must agree with the supply and marketing cooperatives and sign contracts for handling. State-owned industrial and mining enterprises, commerce, private industrial and commercial enterprises, and government production should all make their own plans and report to the local bank for review before lending. The method of loan ordering is very good. Banks are not afraid of losing money, producers do not worry about no sales channels, and production can be operated in a planned way. Commercial loans can be made to all legitimate operators that are beneficial to production and beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, such as the sale of oil, fur, mountain goods, medicinal materials, bristles, eggs, white hemp, mushrooms, native cloth, grain, copper and iron appliances, agricultural implements, coal, alkali, etc.; the transportation industry, such as donkeys, mules, camels, vehicles, etc. Transportation households that increase transportation capacity, as well as Chinese and Western pharmacies, bookstores, printing plants, and other businesses, can all be lent to. All banks must establish a loan inspection system and set up special personnel to handle it. Regardless of the type of loan, it must be inspected at any time to ensure that the loan is used properly and is conducive to the development of production.
