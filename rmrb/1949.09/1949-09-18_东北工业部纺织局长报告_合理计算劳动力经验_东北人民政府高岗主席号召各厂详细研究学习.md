Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 16th. Luo Riyun, Director of the Textile Administration Bureau of the Northeast Industrial Department, recently wrote a letter to Li Fuchun, Vice Chairman of the Northeast People's Government and Deputy Director of the Finance and Economics Committee, reporting their experience in helping work at the Wafangdian Textile Factory, using seconds to calculate the actual labor time standards of workers, and rationally organizing labor. This letter was published in full on the prominent first page of the Northeast Daily. Northeast People's Government Chairman Gao Gang also wrote a note before the letter: "I hope comrades working in all factories will study this in detail, learn this style, and improve their leadership methods."

The letter stated that they and the personnel of the Wafangdian Textile Factory were very united in helping with the work, because they adopted a learning attitude as a member of the factory, under the leadership of the factory's administrative organization, personally doing things that others felt were difficult, and asking the factory personnel for advice in their work. They tried to understand the difficulties of others in their work as their own difficulties, and everyone jointly discussed and studied ways to overcome them. The letter used the cotton cleaning room of the factory as an example to prove the importance of accurately calculating labor standards and rationally organizing labor. The cotton cleaning room of the factory used to employ twenty people per shift (nine hours), but recently the staffing was set at sixteen people, which the factory felt was too few, believing that at least seventeen people were needed. However, after three days of actual testing, it was proven that sixteen people were too many, and fourteen were enough. According to the factory's need for 42,000 spindles, each shift needs to produce 720 cotton laps from the cotton cleaning machines. To complete this requirement, based on the efficiency of the existing eight two-roller cotton cleaners, each machine can produce one cotton lap every five minutes (300 seconds), and a total of seven machines are needed per shift to complete 720 cotton laps. In this way, there is one more machine than needed. In terms of the time spent by workers on production, after precisely calculating the various production processes in the cotton cleaning room (unpacking, weighing, mixing cotton, feeding cotton, first-pass cleaning, second-pass cleaning, machine oiling, etc.) in seconds, a total of more than eighteen hours of idle time was left over, which is exactly two people too many, calculated on the basis of nine hours of work per person.

The letter stated: "From this calculation of the actual labor time of workers in seconds, we have more clearly understood many problems: (1) In the past, our employment of people was mostly blind, and the estimation of the actual labor intensity and technical proficiency of each worker was abstract. (2) How to use every minute and every second of daily work time entirely on reasonable and practical labor. According to the experience of the past few days, this organizational work must: (1) Factory leaders understand the production process and the precise time required, and organize labor based on this understanding. (2) Carry out detailed division of labor based on the actual labor time required for each project calculated in seconds, fix workers on certain machines, clarify responsibilities, and promote labor by driving the operation of the machines. (3) Continuously study and improve the worker's operating methods. It is necessary to ensure that workers do not waste time every minute and every second during working hours, and that they are not excessively tired. (4) The factory building and machine arrangement should be rationalized. So that workers can watch more machines, and be able to easily take care of other machines while working on this machine, so that every minute and every second of the worker's labor is consumed on the machines, not on running around. (5) Calculate worker labor time in seconds, reduce unnecessary workers, and increase worker labor intensity. To enable workers to persevere, it is necessary to reasonably determine wages based on his labor consumption per minute and second, as well as the responsibilities he assumes and the size of his technical skills, in order to consolidate and exert his labor intensity and skills. (6) In order for workers to exert their labor intensity, it is also necessary to: (A) Improve political awareness, so that he consciously learns technology and constantly studies and improves his operating methods. (B) The workshops and sanitary equipment must be improved, so that the air flows smoothly in the workshops, and the humidity, temperature, lighting, etc. are appropriate, the tools are good, and the workers are guaranteed not to be affected by the work. (7) It is necessary to maintain product quality and take care of the machines, rather than abandoning quality to calculate the labor consumption of each project. Therefore, when calculating the labor consumed in seconds, we must first examine and study the quality.

　　东北工业部纺织局长报告
  　合理计算劳动力经验
    东北人民政府高岗主席号召各厂详细研究学习
    【新华社沈阳十六日电】东北人民政府工业部纺织管理局长罗日运最近写给东北人民政府副主席兼财政经济委员会副主任李富春一封信，报告他们到瓦房店纺织厂帮助工作中用秒来计算工人实际劳动时间标准，合理组织劳动力的经验。这封信被东北日报全文刊登于一版显著地位。东北人民政府高岗主席并在信前批注：“希望各工厂工作同志详细研究，学习这种作风，改进自己的领导方法。”
    信中说他们来瓦房店纺织厂帮助工作后和该厂人员都很团结，因为他们是以学习的态度作为厂里的一员，在该厂行政组织领导之下，亲自动手去做别人感觉是困难的工作，并且在工作中向该厂人员请教。他们处处去体会别人在工作中的困难，当作自己的困难，大家共同讨论研究克服办法。信中以该厂清花间为例，证明精确计算用人标准、合理组织劳动力的重要。该厂清花间过去每班（九小时）用二十个人，最近定员十六人，该厂感到太少，认为无论如何得十七人。但经过三天的实际试验，证明十六个人还多，只要十四个就够了。根据该厂四万二千纺锭的需要，每班需清花机制成花卷七百二十个。清花间要完成这一要求，就其现有的八台二道清花机的设备效能来看，每台每五分钟（三百秒）可产一个花卷，每班共需要七台机器即可完成七百二十个花卷。这样一来，现有机器尚多一台。以工人生产所费时间来看，在用秒精细计算了清花间的各个生产过程（拆包、过秤、配花、喂花、头道清花、二道清花、机器加油等）所实际需用的时间后，共计多余出空闲时间十八个小时还多，以每人九小时工作计算，恰好是多用两个人。
    该信中说：“从这次用秒计算工人实际劳动时间中，使我们更清楚地了解了许多问题：（一）过去我们的用人多是盲目的，对每一个工人实际劳动强度与技术熟练程度的估计是抽象的。（二）如何把每天工作时间，一分一秒地全部用在合理的实际劳动上。这一组织工作，根据这几天的经验，必须：（１）工厂领导者了解生产过程及其所需的精确时间，并根据这一了解来组织劳动力。（２）根据用秒来计算每一个工程实际需要劳动时间来进行细腻的分工，把工人固定在一定的机台上，责任分明，以机台运转来推动劳动。（３）不断地研究改善工人的操作法。既要使工人在工作时间内每分每秒不浪费时间，而又使他不过分疲劳。（４）工厂建筑和机器安排做到合理化。使工人看机台多，在这台机上干活又能很方便地照顾到其他机台，使工人每分每秒的劳动消耗在机台，不消耗在跑路上。（５）以秒计算工人劳动时间，减少不必要的工人，增加工人劳动强度。要使工人能够坚持下去，就要按他在一分一秒钟的劳动消耗上，以及按他担当的责任与使用他的技术性的大小，合理地确定工资，以巩固与发挥他的劳动强度和技术。（６）为使工人能够发挥他的劳动强度，又必须：（Ａ）提高政治觉悟，使他自觉学习技术，不断地研究改善自己的操作法。（Ｂ）工房与卫生设备要改善，使工房内空气畅流，湿度、温度、照明等适当，工具良好，保证工人不因工作影响健康。（７）必须保持产品质量，爱护机器，而不是丢开质量，来计算每一工程的劳动消耗。因此，在用秒计算所消耗劳动时，首先必须审查与研究质量。
