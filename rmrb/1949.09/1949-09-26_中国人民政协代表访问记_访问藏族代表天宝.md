　　A Reporter's Visit to Delegates of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference
  　An Interview with Tibetan Delegate Tian Bao
    Lin Mo
    Tian Bao began his conversation with boundless excitement and joy. He said, "The delegates of the minority nationalities participating in the People's Political Consultative Conference represent nine ethnic groups. We are here to jointly discuss the major affairs of the Chinese people, which are also the major affairs of all ethnic groups in China. This signifies the great unity of our fraternal ethnic groups in China in close friendship and love. Starting from here, with the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the help of all fraternal ethnic groups, the oppression suffered by various minority nationalities in China and their particularly backward and inhuman lives will gradually come to an end." Tian Bao deeply felt the conference's concern and emphasis on the interests of all minority nationalities. He said, "Many problems even we ourselves have not thought of, but the leaders of the conference, headed by Chairman Mao, have already considered them in many ways and planned them meticulously." He believed that such equal emphasis and concern for all ethnic groups could only be achieved under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, which truly possesses a great spirit of internationalism.
    Tian Bao used his personal experience to illustrate the path to the liberation of minority nationalities. In his hometown of Batang in Xikang, the Tibetan people had waged countless large and small bloody struggles to resist the exploitation and oppression of the Manchu Qing officials and warlords. For example, in 1933, Tibetan monks and laypeople in the Daji Temple area of Xikang sold their property and furniture to prepare weapons to resist the atrocities of Liu Wenhui's Sichuan warlord troops. However, each struggle only resulted in greater persecution. But when the Red Army on the Long March arrived in Xikang in 1934, they helped the Tibetan people establish their own Boba Soviet government, and the Tibetan people participated in governments at all levels, becoming their own masters. This event was long remembered by the local people. Tian Bao himself joined the Young Pioneers at this time, later served as an instructor in a cavalry company, and then became the head of the Youth Department of the Boba Soviet. When the Boba people's armed forces formed the Boba Independent Division and went north to resist Japan, he was the party representative of the division. In the middle, he was able to study politics, military affairs, and culture in schools for five or six years. Later, as a cadre working with minority nationalities, he went to the Ordos League to help liberate Mongolian compatriots. In the two or three years of the People's Liberation War, he led the armed forces of the Ordos League people in attacking the Ma and Hu bandit troops. In this way, he grew up under the care, help, education, and cultivation of the Communist Party. Then he went to help others. Tian Bao said, "I feel that the Communist Party has a natural responsibility and feeling for minority nationalities." He cited that in Yan'an, a mosque was specially built for the Hui compatriots to worship (but Hu Zongnan's bandit troops ravaged and destroyed it when they occupied Yan'an), and a Nationalities Institute was established for minority nationalities to study. In the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region government at that time, there was a special Nationalities Affairs Committee, with representatives from various ethnic groups participating. Most notably, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Government was established, and the lives of the people of Inner Mongolia have improved significantly in recent years. This is an example of minority nationalities gaining liberation under the leadership and help of the Chinese Communist Party.
    Regarding the imperialist ambitions of Britain and the United States to invade Tibet, especially the recent incident in which Britain instigated Nehru of India to create the so-called prevention of communists entering Tibet, Tian Bao pointed out that this is entirely a trick played by imperialism in its vain attempt to enslave the Tibetan people. During the late Qing Dynasty, the Xinhai Revolution, and the Great Revolution of 1927, whenever the British imperialists saw the Chinese people wanting independence and liberation, they played the same conspiracy in Tibet. The Chinese people know that British imperialism has long harbored ambitions to invade Tibet, and in the past, it has continuously sent upper-class members of the Tibetan people to study in Britain, instilling them with slavish ideas to serve imperialism. But only a very few are willing to be driven by them. The broad masses of the Tibetan people will know who are the liberators from their suffering. The recent arrival of the People's Liberation Army in the Northwest and Southwest provinces, and the warm celebration and support from the Hui, Tibetan, Miao, and other ethnic groups in various places, is a good illustration. Finally, he said, "The fraternal ethnic groups of China are holding a united conference here and announcing the establishment of the People's Republic of China. This will be the greatest call and encouragement to the minority nationalities who are not yet liberated!"

　　中国人民政协代表访问记
  　访问藏族代表天宝
    林沫
    天宝以无限兴奋和庆喜的心情开始他的谈话。他说：“参加人民政协的少数民族的代表有九种民族，我们来共商中国人民的也就是中国各民族的大事，这是我们中国各兄弟民族亲密友爱的大团结。我们各兄弟民族在中国的土地上紧紧拉起手来，从这里开始，中国各种少数民族所忍受的压迫，所过的特别落后的与非人的生活，在中国共产党的领导与各兄弟民族的帮助之下就要逐渐结束。”天宝深感大会对各个少数民族利益的关切和重视。他说：“有很多问题连我们自己还没有想到，但是以毛主席为首的大会的领导者都已经多方考虑和精心的计划了。”他认为这种对各民族的平等的重视和关切，只有在真正具有伟大国际主义精神的中国共产党领导之下才能够这样作。
    天宝以亲身的经验说明少数民族解放的道路。在他的家乡西康党坝，藏族人民为反抗满清官僚及军阀的鱼肉和压迫，曾进行过无数次大小流血的斗争。如一九三三年西康大吉寺一带的藏民喇嘛曾把财产家具卖掉，置备武装反抗四川军阀刘文辉军队的暴行。但每次斗争所得的结果只是遭受更大的迫害。而当一九三四年长征的红军到达西康时，却帮助藏族人民成立自己的波巴苏维埃政府，藏族人民参加各级政权，成了自己的主人，此事为当地人民长久的记忆着。天宝自己就在这时参加了少先队，后来作骑兵连的指导员，继任波巴苏维埃青年部部长，当波巴的人民武装组成波巴独立师北上抗日时，他是该师的党代表。中间有五、六年的时间他得以进学校学习着政治、军事和文化。以后，作为一个少数民族工作的干部，他到伊克昭盟去帮助蒙民同胞的解放。在人民解放战争的两三年中，他领导伊盟人民的武装进攻的马、胡匪军。就是这样，他自己在共产党的爱护帮助教育和培养中成长起来。然后他又去帮助别人。天宝说：“我感到共产党对少数民族有一种自然的责任和感情。”他举出，在延安曾特为回族同胞做礼拜修了清真寺，（胡宗南匪军在侵占延安则把她糟踏破坏。）设立供少数民族学习的民族学院。在当时的陕甘宁边区政府中曾专设有民族事务委员会，有各民族代表参加。最明显的是，内蒙古在中国共产党的领导下成立了内蒙自治政府，几年来内蒙人民的生活已显著上升，这是少数民族在中国共产党的领导和帮助之下获得解放的一个榜样。
    对于英美帝国主义野心侵略西藏的阴谋，特别是最近英国策动印度尼赫鲁在西藏所制造的所谓防止共产党进入西藏的事件，天宝指出，这完全是帝国主义妄想奴役西藏人民所玩弄的鬼把戏。在满清末年辛亥革命及一九二七年大革命时期，英帝国主义每当看到中国人民要独立解放的时候，都曾在西藏玩弄过同样的阴谋。中国人民知道英帝国主义对西藏的侵略处心已久，过去曾不断的把藏民中的上层分子弄往英国留学，灌输以奴化思想，使其为帝国主义服务。但甘心受其驱使的只有极少数，广大的藏族人民会知道谁是他们痛苦的解放者，最近人民解放军进抵西北、西南各省，各地的回、藏、苗等族人民热烈的欢庆和拥护就是一个很好的说明。最后他说：“中国各兄弟民族在这里开团结的大会，宣布中华人民共和国的成立，这对一时尚未解放的少数民族将是一个最大的号召和鼓舞！”
