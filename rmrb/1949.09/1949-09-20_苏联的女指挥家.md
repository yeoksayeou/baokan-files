　　Soviet Women Conductors
　　Translated by Zhang Deng
　　Traditional habits have made people used to seeing men holding batons. The general impression is that only the hand of a strong man can grasp the powerful elements of music and the many different instruments, from the clumsy double bass to the lively flute...
　　However, Soviet women conductors have invaded the male domain. Here are the stories of two of them.
　　Twenty years ago, pianist Irina Shenkevich first stepped onto the podium. A student of the famous Soviet pianist Essipova, she did not expect to become a conductor overnight. It was Glazunov who first recognized her conducting talent. But she was deterred by the idea that "conducting is not a woman's profession."
　　However, after a long period of consideration, and having gained experience in holding concerts and teaching music, she entered the conducting class of the Odessa Music Association. After that, she became the only female conductor in the Soviet Union. Her classmates regarded her with a respectful amazement. But when the audience saw a woman standing on the podium of the Odessa Opera House, it caused even greater surprise.
　　After that, Irina Shenkevich successfully worked as a conductor in the opera houses of Perm, Astrakhan, and Odessa. For the last fifteen years, she has been engaged in radio broadcasting. Selections from classical operas such as "Ruslan and Lyudmila," "The Merry Wives of Windsor," "Tosca," "Madame Butterfly," etc., have been broadcast under her direction.
　　Irina conducts operas mostly from memory, without sheet music.
　　In the autumn of 1941, when the Germans reached the gates of Moscow, the young conductor Vera Rud, who had just graduated from the Moscow State Conservatory, voluntarily joined the Red Army.
　　She was ordered to organize a military band for the guard division she served in. A woman as captain, this was the first time in a Soviet military band. The division had first-rate dancers and singers, and later Vera Rud organized and led a song and dance ensemble.
　　In the battle to defend Moscow, this division was awarded the Guards laurel. The black-eyed woman also wore a Guards medal on her uniform. Vera Rud participated in the fighting march from Moscow to Königsberg.
　　After the war, she appeared on the podium in an evening gown, wearing several medals, which reminded people of her glorious war record.

　　苏联的女指挥家
    张灯译
    传统的习惯使人们看惯了男子手拿指挥棒。一般的印象都认为：必须是一个强壮的男性的手才能掌握住音乐的有力的因素与许多各种各样的乐器，从拙笨的低音提琴直到变化活泼的长笛……
    但是，苏联的女指挥家已经侵入了男性的领域。下面是其中两个人的故事。
    二十年之前，钢琴家爱琳娜·珊克薇琪第一次上了指挥台。她是有名的苏联钢琴家爱西包娃的学生，她没有想到一夜之间她会成为一个指挥者。首先看出她的指挥才能的是格拉惹诺夫。但是她被“指挥不是一个女性的职业”的想法所阻遏了。
    可是，经过长时间的考虑，已经具有了举行音乐会与教授音乐的经验之后，她便进了奥德萨音乐协会的指挥班。此后她便成了苏联唯一的女指挥家。她的同学们都对她怀着带有惊讶意味的敬意。但是当观众们看见站在奥德萨歌剧院指挥台上的是一个女子时，是引起了格外大的惊异的。
    此后爱琳娜·珊克薇琪在伯尔姆·阿斯特拉克汉与奥德萨地方的歌剧院里，成功地做了一个指挥。最后的十五年她从事于无线电播音工作。选自古典歌剧的如“拉斯兰与列得米拉”，“温莎的快乐妇人”，“塔斯卡”，“蝴蝶夫人”等等，都是在她的指挥之下广播出去的。
    爱琳娜指挥歌剧，大半根据记忆，不要乐谱。
    一九四一年秋，当德国人到了莫斯科的大门外的时候，刚从莫斯科公立音乐学校毕业出来的年青的指挥维拉·露德，志愿地加入了红军。
    她受命为她所服务的警卫师组织一个军乐队。女子作队长，在苏联军乐队中，这还是第一次。师里有第一等的舞蹈者与歌手，后来维拉·露德更组织了并领导了一个歌舞团。
    在保卫莫斯科的战斗中，这一师得到了保卫桂冠。这位黑眼女子的制服上也佩上了一颗保卫勋章。维拉·露德曾参加从莫斯科到科恩尼格斯堡的战斗行军。
    战争过去之后，她穿着晚礼服在指挥席上出现，佩戴着几颗勋章，这使人回想到她的光荣的战迹。
