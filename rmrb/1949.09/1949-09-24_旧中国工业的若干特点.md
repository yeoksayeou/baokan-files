Several Characteristics of Old China's Industry
　　Chen Zhen
  　I. The Meager Proportion of Modern Industry Output in the Entire National Economy
    Old China's industry had many backward characteristics, formed by the oppression of imperialism and its lackeys, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. These backward characteristics were strikingly marked by the extraordinary backwardness of modern industrial output, accounting for only about 10% of the total value of industrial and agricultural production, while agriculture and handicrafts accounted for about 90%. Old China's economy was characterized by a vast, technologically backward, and cruelly exploited and oppressed scattered individual peasant economy and small producers. This led to the narrowness of the domestic market and the inability to supply large quantities of high-quality industrial raw materials.
    As everyone knows, the economies of pre-revolutionary Russia and the new democratic countries of Southeast Europe were originally backward. However, in 1913, the output of modern industry in Russia accounted for 42.1% of the total value of industrial and agricultural production. In Hungary, the average annual industrial production value from 1933 to 1937 reached 38%. In Romania, it accounted for over 30% in 1942, and in Bulgaria, the industrial output value also accounted for 20% in 1942. This shows how low the level of industrial development in China was.
    To help readers understand the industrial output of China, three statistical tables are quoted below:

    In Table 1, China's output is for the year 1933. The output in this year was even greater than the output in 1948 after the end of the Anti-Japanese War, but it was far behind Russia before the revolution, and in terms of time, we had run 20 years more than them.
    In Table 2, China's output is for the year with the highest industrial output in China. This was because, at that time, Japanese imperialists, in order to carry out their war of aggression, massively developed the smelting industries of steel, iron, and electricity in the Northeast and North China. However, even in this year, the combined output of the occupied areas and the rear areas of the Kuomintang could not match Russia's output in 1913 for many basic products. And in terms of time, it had run 30 years more than them.
    From Table 3, we can see that the level of industrial development in China was 100 to 150 years behind that of advanced capitalist countries.
    Not only that, but China's industrial output could not even keep up with that of colonial India. For example, in 1933, China produced 0.8 times less pig iron, 27 times less steel, 0.9 times less spindles, and 4.5 times less looms than India in the same year.
    The industrial development of old China was exceptionally backward, but China had a larger population than other countries. Therefore, such meager output could not be self-sufficient. According to the statistics of "Ten Years of China" (a reactionary book) published before the Anti-Japanese War, before the war, China's industrial products, except for silk fabrics, matches, and vegetable oil, had surpluses. The self-sufficiency rate of other major products was only 79% for cotton textiles, 40% for sugar, 39% for paper, 27% for woolen textiles, 89% for acids, 85% for alkalis, 0.2% for oil and gasoline, 5% for steel, 24% for machinery, 17% for vehicles and ships, and 50% for electricity. This statistic is not perfect, because China's industry was underdeveloped, and the products used by various industrial sectors were not many. Moreover, this statistic was not based on the needs of the broad masses of the people throughout the country. But even so, it can be seen how small our self-sufficiency rate was. Now, let's calculate based on a population of 450 million. The per capita income of each Chinese person compared with the per capita income of each foreigner is shown in the following table:
Year			Pre-war			Pre-war			Foreign is 1913
								China is 1933
Category		Electricity (degrees)	Cement (pounds)		Steel (kilograms)
Per capita income of each Chinese person	4.3			5			1.2
United States		1,260			450			329
Britain			608			——			171
France			490			——			——
Germany			735			——			229
Russia			215			——			30
Japan			215			130			11
Annam, Taiwan		——			7			——
    II. Monopoly of Foreign Capital
    China's capitalist development was a latecomer. China's industry suffered from imperialist oppression from its beginning. Relying on various privileges in China, with its advanced technology and abundant funds, imperialism used methods of forcible occupation, cunning plundering, and through bureaucratic capital and feudal forces, constantly attacked and annexed China's national industry, forming an imperialist monopoly in China's industry.
    Taking Shanghai as an example, according to the statistics of the Shanghai Social Bureau, in 1928, out of the 300 million yuan of industrial investment in the city, foreign capital accounted for 200 million yuan. In other words, foreign capital was twice as large as Chinese capital.
    In the heavy industry sector, in 1933, in the coal mine output in the inland areas, Japanese capital accounted for 29%, British capital accounted for 23.5%, and German capital accounted for 1%. Adding these items together, foreign capital exceeded half. As for the Northeast, Japanese capital was in an overwhelmingly dominant position, accounting for 84.1% of the total.
    In the mining of iron ore, China produced more than 2 million tons of iron sand annually, of which about 60% was in the Northeast, completely monopolized by Japanese capital. Of the approximately 900,000 tons produced in the inland areas, about 90% was related to Japanese capital and completely controlled by it. Of the 400,000 tons of pig iron produced by modern methods in China each year, Japan accounted for more than 95%.
    In the electric power industry, in 1936, the power generation capacity of the American Shanghai Power Company alone was greater than the electricity generated by all Chinese power plants in the inland areas.
    The cotton textile industry was the largest industry in China, but in 1935, British and Japanese spindles accounted for 43.2%, yarn spindles accounted for 67.4%, and looms accounted for 52%. In addition, in the cigarette industry, foreign capital accounted for 51% of the output. In the soap industry, the British-owned China Soap Company in Shanghai alone accounted for half of the national output. In the leather industry, foreign merchants accounted for more than one-third of the output. It can be seen that foreign capital was in a monopolistic position. Comparing the total industrial output, according to the statistics of Wu Baosan and Wang Fuxun, in 1933, there were a total of 673 foreign-owned factories in China, accounting for only 17% of the total number of Chinese and foreign factories, but the number of employees was 235,000, accounting for 30% of the total number of workers. The production value was 770 million yuan, accounting for 35% of the total. This material is incomplete and underestimates the productivity of foreign factories, but it is already an alarming figure.
    The initial foreign investment in China was dominated by Britain. According to Remer's statistics, in 1902, British investment in China accounted for 33% of the total investment in China by the great powers. The United States accounted for 2.5%, and Japan accounted for only 0.1% at that time. However, during the First World War, Japan took advantage of the great powers' lack of time to look eastward, and the percentage of investment in China increased rapidly to 13.6%. By 1913, it had jumped to 35.1%, competing with Britain's 36.7% at the time. After the "September 18th Incident", Japan caught up with its rival and seized the top spot, with the percentage increasing to 53%, and the old British leader retreated to 24%. After the "July 7th Incident", the Kuomintang government fled without a fight, and Japan almost dominated the entire China, confiscating the property of Britain, the United States, and its vassals in China. Japanese investment in China formed a monopolistic situation, turning the occupied areas of China into its colony. According to incomplete statistics, in the Northeast region, as of the end of June 1945, Japanese industrial investment reached 24.1 billion yen. In the North China region, the "North China Development Company" had invested 698 million yen by the end of 1941. In the Central China region, the "Central China Development Company" had invested 244 million yen by the end of 1942. Investment in the Mengjiang region was also 170 million yuan. In Taiwan, more than 700 million yuan of industrial and mining capital had been invested by 1938. There is no doubt that this money was scraped from the Chinese people and other colonial people and the Japanese people. Adding up these incomplete materials from these places, it has reached 26 billion yen, equivalent to about 10 billion US dollars at that time. This figure is more than twice as large as the total political and economic investment of 4.5 billion US dollars by all the great powers (including Japan) in 1937, and 25 times larger than Gu Chunfan's estimate of the 1 billion yuan of factory capital in China before the war.
    After Japan surrendered, American imperialism replaced Japan in monopolizing China. The United States first helped the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang to seize Japanese assets in China. At the same time, it helped the Kuomintang government with huge loans and materials in the name of "relief," "aid to China," and "cooperation." Then, it ordered the Kuomintang army to slaughter the Chinese people for it. The United States thereby obtained all military, political, and financial powers, and the Kuomintang government listened to its orders obediently. According to the "White Paper," this material and financial political and economic investment by the United States accounted for "more than 50% of the Kuomintang government's monetary expenditure." Among them, in the military field, it supplied "most of the military supplies" to the Kuomintang government. The United States monopolized the entire import and export trade of the Kuomintang area. American commodities rushed into China like a landslide, almost causing the collapse of the entire industry in the Kuomintang area. In addition, the Kuomintang's Resource Committee and the factories, mines, and railways run by its ministries, provinces, cities, and bureaucrats either participated in American capital, or borrowed money, or relied on the United States in terms of technology, raw materials, and equipment. And all the rare metal minerals in China that could be used to manufacture military supplies, such as tungsten, antimony, tin, aluminum, and mercury, had to be transported to the United States to pay off debts. It can be seen that the essence of American imperialism's plunder is exactly the same as that of Japan. Both used slaughter and robbery to turn China into its colony. However, it is more cunning, insidious, and vicious in form. It does not directly send troops like Japan, but rather provides money and guns, and orders the Kuomintang government to send people to slaughter the Chinese people. It does not directly come forward to manage Chinese factories, mines, and railways like Japan, but rather carries out monopolistic plunder in the name of "cooperation."
    III. Monopoly of Military, Feudal, and Comprador Bureaucratic Capital
    Chinese bureaucrats used coercive methods to plunder the people's wealth and open factories for the purpose of slaughtering the people. As early as 1862, Li Hongzhang founded the Shanghai Artillery Bureau. The equipment and technology of these government-run factories relied on imperialism. However, at this time, bureaucratic capital was very weak, and it could not monopolize any industrial sector.
    The bureaucratic capital headed by the four families of Chiang, Kong, Song, and Chen inherited and promoted this old reactionary and dark side, especially by taking advantage of the difficult environment during the Anti-Japanese War, forming a monopolistic and exclusive position. Subsequently, because of the seizure of huge enemy and puppet industries, the area of monopolistic exclusive further penetrated into various industrial sectors and various profitable undertakings. Such as mines, smelting, electricity, and electrical appliances in the heavy industry sector, textiles, flour, sugar, and paper printing in the light industry sector, railways, aviation, ships, postal and telecommunications, highways in the transportation sector, as well as finance, trust, insurance, warehouses, housing, and import and export trade, etc., it can be said that it is all-encompassing and pervasive. And among these undertakings, the financial undertakings of the four banks and two bureaus of the Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Agricultural Bank were their highest concentration points. The four families used this colonial financial capital to further monopolize industry, transportation, and trade sectors. In terms of industrial output, according to official statistics, the undertakings operated by the Resource Committee in 1947 accounted for the following proportions of the national total: electricity 63%, coal 33%, steel 90%, tungsten ore 100%, tin 70%, cement 45%, and sugar 90%. If we add the enterprises run by the Kuomintang's ministries, provinces, parties, groups, and those that were nominally "private" but actually government-run, the proportion they accounted for would of course be even greater. In terms of employees, according to Li Zixiang's statistics, in 1944, the "state-owned" factories monopolized by the four families alone accounted for 29.2% of the total number of employees in the Kuomintang-ruled areas at that time. From the perspective of capital, according to the statistics of the Economic Weekly No. 28, government-run enterprises accounted for more than 80% of the total industrial capital.
    This was an exceptionally large monopoly. However, this monopolistic bureaucratic capital had many differences from the monopolistic capital of imperialism. From its initial creation until before its collapse, this bureaucratic capital always relied on imperialism and became a part of the imperialist appendage. As is well known, the Resource Committee, one of the largest systems of bureaucratic capital in the Kuomintang government, was founded with capital borrowed from the United States using rare metal minerals. Its initial undertakings, such as "the tungsten iron plant cooperated with the German side, the steel plant cooperated with the German and American sides, the oil refinery and nitrogen plant cooperated with the German side, the machine factory cooperated with the American and Swiss sides, and the electrical equipment factory cooperated with the German, American, and Swiss sides" (see Qian Changzhao's "Experience and Thoughts on Founding Heavy Industry in the Past Two Years"). After Japan surrendered, government-run factories such as electricity, steel, oil, chemical, coal mine, electrical appliance, and sugar enterprises all relied on the United States in terms of technology, equipment, or capital. Therefore, this bureaucratic capital had a strong comprador character and became the agent of American imperialism in China. It made some comprador profits from American imperialism.
    Bureaucratic capital also had military and feudal characteristics. That is to say, bureaucratic enterprises such as the Resource Committee and the Ordnance Department, from the beginning to before their collapse, focused on the production of military supplies and served the anti-people civil war. This bureaucratic capital represented the interests of big compradors, big bourgeoisie, and big landlords. It regarded operating enterprises as a tool for making money. It used its political power to brutally plunder workers, peasants, and other working people and oppress the free bourgeoisie in a very barbaric way, and accumulated huge amounts of wealth. In addition, bureaucratic capital also had extreme corruption. In addition to stifling the development of private industry, its own management and operation were very corrupt.
    IV. The Exceptionally Weak Proportion of Production Means Sector
    According to the materials of the book "China's National Income", in 1933, including Chinese and foreign factories, the total production value was 2,076,322,000 yuan, and the production means sector was only 360,801,000 yuan, accounting for only 17% of the total. The main sector of production means - the machine manufacturing industry - was even pitifully small, accounting for only 0.9% of the total production value. If we add the mining output value of 367,439,000 yuan, the total is only 728,240,000 yuan, which is only 30% of the total value.
    During the Anti-Japanese War, due to the blockade of seaports, the production of the production means sector had considerable development. However, after the "victory", the Kuomintang government believed that everything was good in the United States, "everything needs to be Americanized", and "the moon is also better in the United States". It allowed the private heavy industry that had supported the development of the Anti-Japanese War to be ravaged by the economic crisis at that time. The Japanese imperialists left a considerable part of the heavy industry in China during their rule. However, the Kuomintang government took the opportunity to seize these factories, regarding them as tools for monopolistic profiteering and carrying out civil war. It not only did not have appropriate coordination with light industry, but also made it a point to stifle national industry. As a result of corrupt management, the production of the production means sector after the war did not increase significantly. In some places, such as Shanghai, there was a downward trend.
    The emphasis on consumer production and the underdeveloped production means sector was one of the reasons for the weakness of old China's industry. It made it impossible for old China to have national defense forces, and had to rely on imperialism economically and technologically. China's industry became a sales place for foreign commodities, or a processing plant for semi-finished products, or even a raw material supply base for imperialism.
    V. Backward Technology and Management
    Relatively large-scale factories like the Anshan Iron and Steel Plant, Xiaofengman Power Plant, and China Textile Company were rare in China. The characteristics of old China's industry were that, on the one hand, large industries concentrated huge output and huge numbers of workers, and most of these industries were controlled by the four families of bureaucratic capital. On the other hand, a large number of small factories with simple equipment existed extensively. Taking the machinery industry as an example, in 1948, there were a total of 643 machine factories in Shanghai, with 8,509 machine tools. Among them, there were 420 with 1 to 9 machine tools, 128 with 10 to 19, and only 74 with 20 to 59. There were even fewer with more than 60, only 23. It can be seen that small factories accounted for an overwhelming advantage.
    The textile industry was the most large-scale industry in China. According to Wang Da's investigation, in 1936, the total capital of the five major Chinese yarn factories in Tianjin was only more than 15 million yuan, with an average of only more than 3.06 million yuan per factory. Compared with the capital of the Nisshin Textile Company of Japan, which had the least capital at that time, more than 16 million yuan, five factories were only equivalent to one Japanese factory. Compared with the Nagasaki Textile Company of Japan, which had 53.8 million yuan, it was even less. The capital of the machinery industry was even weaker. According to Japanese translated materials, before the war, the largest "Dalong" factory had only 500,000 yuan of capital. At that time, the 753 factories in the country had a total capital of more than 7.83 million yuan, with an average of only more than 10,000 yuan per factory.
    Most of the capital organizational forms of old China's private industry were sole proprietorships and partnerships. According to 1933 statistics, these two organizational forms accounted for 66% of the total. This organizational style limited the large-scale raising of funds, and the source of raw materials was not easy. Donation taxes and miscellaneous expenses were huge. Therefore, in the distribution of capital, it was necessary to focus on purchasing and hoarding raw materials and coping with miscellaneous expenses. The addition of fixed capital equipment had to be as simple as possible. This situation especially increased with the Kuomintang government's high tax policy, inflation, and speculation and manipulation led by the four families.
    Under these circumstances, the equipment in Chinese factories had to be extremely simple. On average, in 1947, the Ministry of Economic Affairs surveyed 14,078 factories in major cities, employing 682,399 workers, using 827,272 horsepower, and using 162,211 kilovolt-amperes of electricity. On average, each factory had only 48 workers, using 58 horsepower and 11 kilovolt-amperes of electricity. Each worker used only 1.2 horsepower and 0.2 kilovolt-amperes of electricity. But in 1910, each worker in Germany could use 3.9 horsepower, France (1911) could use 2.8 horsepower, the United States (1908) could use 3.6 horsepower, and Russia had 1.5 horsepower for each industrial and agricultural worker before World War I.
    Although the equipment of government-run factories was relatively different, under the management of the Kuomintang bureaucrats who only knew how to plunder and destroy, the original equipment was also deteriorating. The China Textile Company was a factory that earned large monopolistic profits every year, but the Kuomintang government had been operating it for so many years, and the equipment had never been added or improved. "At the beginning of the takeover, the government never used the heart of developing industry to nourish the China Textile Company. In the government's eyes, the China Textile Company was like a money tree" (see the words of Lu Tongzhi, deputy manager of the China Textile Company in 1948). In the past two years, the Kuomintang government knew that it was about to collapse, and it intensified its destructive start-up. These bandits always carried out large-scale destruction of machine parts and equipment before retreating.
    The equipment and organization of some smaller factories were even simpler. The author saw some of these small factories in a medium-sized city. They often rented two or three rooms, placed some simple tools, and collected a large pile of various old parts and raw materials. Most of them had more apprentices than workers, and more short-term workers than long-term workers. The factory director was often the manager and supervisor or participated in the work. The factory director's wife, in addition to raising children, also worked as an accountant, or even as a salesperson to entertain customers, or helped the chief steward with his work. These houses had no sanitary equipment and were both a place to work and a storefront. This was the result of the difficulty in developing old China's industry, a method used by the petty bourgeoisie to reduce costs.
    Not only that, but most of the machine parts and equipment of the newly established factories in old China were old ones, or partly newly purchased, and completely new equipment was rare. Therefore, these machine parts and equipment were mostly outdated and old. For example, the China Textile Company was relatively new, but its machine parts had been used for more than ten years. Before the war, 41 textile factories of Chinese merchants in seven provinces were surveyed, of which about 70% of the machine parts had been used for less than 20 years. Moreover, these machine parts were mostly pieced together. One author wrote this way: "The tools produced domestically are very few. Although there are machine tools and sub-machines produced, they are all small in size. It is absolutely impossible for one factory to supply them. It is necessary to piece them together to make them possible. Many slightly larger factories have a very interesting power equipment. Some parts are German, some are American, or British, or Belgian. Therefore, it is difficult to use them. The allocation of parts is not an easy task" (Business Daily, October 12, 1944).
    Obviously, this simple and inferior equipment will inevitably reduce production efficiency, increase costs, and produce inferior products. In terms of efficiency, according to the statistics of Wu Baosan and Wang Fuxun, the production efficiency of Chinese factory workers is only equal to one-nineteenth of that of American workers. According to experts, before the war, eight miners were able to match one American miner. In yarn factories, eight Chinese male workers were equal to one American female worker, and thirty Chinese male workers were equal to one American male worker.
    As mentioned above, old China's industry was lower than other capitalist countries in terms of capital, equipment, and production efficiency. The same factory did not employ fewer workers than others, the working hours were longer than others, the child labor and bonded labor systems were very popular, the living conditions of workers were exceptionally bad, and various forms of extra exploitation were very heavy. Worker welfare facilities were simply out of the question. All of this shows that the main method used by the Chinese bourgeoisie to compete with foreign countries, reduce its costs, and pursue profits was to strengthen the exploitation of laborers. This exploitation rate was about 200% to 250% before the war, which was much higher than that of foreign countries. Therefore, it also made the Chinese proletariat develop a strong fighting spirit.
    Here, let me add a few words about the shortcomings of industrial management in old China. Taking the Kuomintang's government-run factories as an example, these factories were mostly large in organization, with positions set up for people rather than for tasks. Many people relied on nepotism to get food. The proportion of non-production personnel and employees was very large. The organizational structure was often divorced from production. In terms of personnel, they shirked responsibility from each other, were extravagant, corrupt, wasteful, scattered, lax, inefficient, had high costs, few products, and were common diseases. Some good managers could not play their role under this atmosphere. These government-run factories were supported by various privileges such as tax exemption, donation exemption, and reliance on monopolistic profits. There are countless such examples, and I will not go into details here.
    VI. External Dependence
    Recently, I visited an exhibition room, which displayed the installation process of a radio produced by the Tianjin Electrical Materials Factory of the Kuomintang Resource Committee in the past. This process tells people how to install a radio step by step. The machine is clever and the style is beautiful, but after the comrades introduced the guidance, I realized that all the parts of this radio, from the vacuum tube to a copper wire, a screw, were shipped from the United States. Even the drawings, the installation location, and the installation method were pre-printed and made in the United States. After these parts, drawings, and instructions were shipped to China, as long as they were installed according to its instructions, it would become a beautiful radio. Look, the Americans thought so carefully for us!
    One comrade asked:
    "Why not ship it after it is fully assembled in the United States?"
    B replied: "Because Chinese wages are cheap!"
    This is the secret of imperialist capital plunder, and from here, we can also see the deep external dependence of the old industry. This external dependence was completely made by imperialism and its lackeys of bureaucratic capital. As mentioned above, some of the radio parts, such as radio parts, can be made in China, but bureaucratic capital would rather buy foreign goods and is unwilling to find ways to develop domestic industry. Such as cotton, cloth, wheat, flour, wool, etc., which are originally a large number of Chinese products or improvable raw materials and daily necessities, are also imported from foreign countries in large quantities every year. For example, before liberation, 99% of the Shanghai yarn factories used American cotton. Before the war, half of the wheat raw materials used by Shanghai flour mills every year relied on foreign supply. This external dependence increased year by year. Taking cotton as an example, in 1936, the input was only 813,808 city dans, but in 1946, it increased to 6,891,230 city dans. At the same time, cotton farmers in our cotton-producing areas, such as Shaanxi and Sichuan, changed the cotton fields to other crops because the official purchase price of cotton was too low. This is one aspect. On the other hand, due to the lack of coordination of Chinese industry itself and the backwardness of technology, many valuable raw materials are transported to foreign countries, and foreigners use my cheap raw materials to make various semi-finished or finished products, which are sold in our country to obtain high profits. For example, a large number of tungsten sand, antimony ore, and iron sand are exported every year, but the tungsten wire, alloy steel, and larger machinery needed in China need to rely on foreign supply. Therefore, some people once said that the old Chinese industry was nothing more than an equipment industry (that is, assembling foreign parts into machines), or a processing industry (that is, processing foreign raw materials into supplies), which is not an exaggeration.
    The Northeast has abundant grain and industrial raw materials, contains huge amounts of coal and iron, has the famous Anshan Iron and Steel Plant in East Asia, Fushun, Fuxin and other industrial and mining areas, convenient transportation, and sufficient electricity. The liberated Northeast has a far-reaching prospect for development. It is the leading area of China's heavy industry in the future. But the Northeast during the Japanese rule was another situation. The intention of the Japanese imperialists to operate the Northeast is described in the "Northeast Economic Small Series": "During the puppet Manchu period, the relationship between the Northeast economy and the Japanese economy was extremely close, like a whole. Therefore, both sides adopted the method of division of labor and cooperation, that is, the Northeast focused on the development of industrial resources, and Japan focused on the product industry of high technology." "The lack of vibration in the mechanical industry of the pseudo-Manchukuo is due to the repeated suppression of Japan. Although there are also a part of mechanical factories, they are only in the form of agency stores of the Japanese mechanical industry, so the equipment and technology, etc., have not been able to escape this range; This shows that the purpose of Japan's entry into the Northeast in the early days was only to obtain the market of the industry." "The Northeast in the pseudo-Manchu period, because it was the market for Japanese light industrial goods, and at the same time it was dedicated to developing heavy industry, all resources, funds, labor,

　　旧中国工业的若干特点
    陈真
  　一、新式工业产量在全部国民经济中比重的微弱
    旧中国工业带有许多落后特点，这是以帝国主义为首及其走狗封建主义、官僚资本主义的压迫所形成的。这些落后的特点，显著的标帜表现为新式工业的产量异常落后，它仅占工农业生产总额百分之十左右，而农业和手工业却占百分之九十上下。旧中国经济存在了广大的、技术异常落后的，而又受着残酷剥削压迫的散漫个体农民经济和小生产者，由此招致国内市场的狭窄，与不能供应大量的品质优良的工业原料。
    大家知道，革命前的俄国和东南欧新民主主义国家的经济，原来是落后的，然而，在一九一三年俄国的新式工业产量，占工农业总产值百分之四十二点一，匈牙利在一九三三——一九三七年，平均每年的工业生产价值占到百分之三十八，罗马尼亚在一九四二年时占百分之三十以上，保加利亚在一九四二年工业产值也占到百分之二十，由此可见中国工业发展水平之低。
    为了使读者易于了解中国工业产量起见，下面引用三个统计表：

    第一表，中国的产量是一九三三年度，这一年的产量比起抗日战争结束后的一九四八年产量还要大，但与革命前的俄国比较，远落人家之后，而在时间上，我们却比人家多跑了二十年。
    第二表，中国产量是中国工业产量最高的年份，因为当时日本帝国主义者为了进行其侵略战争，大量发展了东北、华北的钢、铁、电力等冶炼工业。然而，即使是这一年，沦陷区和大后方全国产量加起来，有许多基本的产品，还赶不上一九一三年的俄国。而在时间上却比人家多跑了三十年。
    从第三表中可以看到中国工业发展水准，比起先进的资本主义国家落后了一百至一百五十年。
    不但如此，中国的工业产量，甚至连殖民地的印度也追不上，例如在一九三三年，中国生产的铣铁比起同年的印度要少零点八倍，钢比印度少二十七倍，纱锭比印度少零点九倍，布机比印度少四点五倍。
    旧中国工业发展异常落后，但中国人口比别的国家多，因此，这样微弱的出产是不能自给的，据抗日战争前出版的“十年来之中国”（这是一部反动书籍）统计，战前我国工业产品，除丝织品、火柴、植物油有剩余外，其它主要产品计棉纺织品自给率仅百分之七九，砂糖百分之四○，纸类百分之三九，毛织品百分之二七，酸类百分之八九，碱类百分之八五，石油汽油百分之零点二，钢铁百分之五，机械百分之二四，车辆船舶百分之一七，电气百分之五○，这个统计并不完善的，因为中国工业不发达，工业各部门所用的产品不多，而且这个统计也不是按照全国广大的人民需要而定的自给程度。但，即使如此，也可见我们自给率之微少。现在，我们再按四万万五千万人口计算，每一中国人口所得与外国每一人口所得比较有如下表：年份　　　　　　战前　　　　　　　战前　　　　　　　外国为１９１３年

    中国资本主义发展是个迟到的落伍者，中国工业在其开始发展时，即遭受帝国主义的压迫，帝国主义依靠种种在华特权，挟其先进的技术，雄厚的资金，用强占、巧取豪夺的办法，以及通过官僚资本、封建势力，不断打击吞并中国民族工业，形成帝国主义在华工业上的垄断。
    以上海为例，据上海社会局统计，一九二八年全市工业投资三亿元中，外资即占二亿元，换句话说，就是外资比中国资本大一倍。
    在重工业部门，一九三三年煤矿的产量，关内地区日资占百分之二十九，英资占百分之二十三点五，德资占百分之一，这几项合计，外资已超过半数。至于东北，日本资本更是处于压倒优势的地位，该处日资占总数百分之八四点一。
    铁矿的采掘，中国每年生产二百余万吨的铁砂，其中有百分之六十左右在东北，完全是日本资本独占的。关内的九十万吨左右产量中，有百分之九十左右是和日资有关而完全受其控制的。中国每年用新式制炼的四十万吨生铁，日本即占百分之九十五以上。
    电力工业，一九三六年发电容量，光是上海美国电力公司一家，就比整个关内中国电厂发的电要大。
    棉纺织业是中国最大的工业，可是在一九三五年时，日英纱锭已占百分之四三点二，线锭占百分之六七点四，布机占百分之五二。此外，卷烟业，外资产量占百分之五一，肥皂业，上海英商中国肥皂公司一家就占全国产量之一半。制革业，外商产量占三分之一以上。由此可见，外国资本是处在垄断地位。以全部工业产量比较，根据巫宝三和汪馥荪的材料统计，在一九三三年外国在华开设的工厂共有六百七十三家，在厂数上不过占全部中外工厂合计总数百分之十七，但职工数有二十三万五千人，却占全部工人总数百分之三十，生产价值七亿七千万元占总数百分之三十五。这个材料是不完全的，对外国工厂生产力估计失之过低，但这已是一个惊人的数字了。
    帝国主义对中国的投资，起初是英国盘踞了第一把交椅，据雷麦氏的统计，一九○二年英国对华投资额占列强对华投资总额百分之三十三，美国占百分之二点五，日本在那时只占百分之零点一。但在第一次世界大战期间，日本乘列强无暇东顾，对华投资百分比，飞快的增长到十三点六，到了一九一三年，更一跃而至百分之三十五点一，与当时英国的百分之三六点七，分庭抗礼了。“九一八”事变后，日本赶上了它的对手，夺取了第一把交椅，百分比增到五十三，老大的英国退为百分之二十四了。“七七”事变后，国民党政府不战而逃，日本几乎霸占了整个中国，没收了英美及其附庸的在华财产，日本对华投资形成了独占的局面，把中国沦陷区变成了它的殖民地。据不完全的材料统计，东北区，截至一九四五年六月末，日本工业投资达二百四十一亿日元，华北区，“华北开发公司”截至一九四一年末投下六亿九千八百万日元，华中区，“华中振兴公司”至一九四二年末投资二亿四千四百万日元，蒙疆区投资也有一亿七千万元，台湾，在一九三八年已投下工矿业资本七亿余元，这些钱无疑问的都是刮削中国人民和其他殖民地人民及日本国内人民而来的。以上这几个地方不完全的材料相加起来，已达二百六十亿日元，折合当时美金约有一百亿美元。这个数字较之一九三七年全部列强（包括日本在内）的政治经济投资四十五亿美元大了一倍有多，比起谷春帆估计的战前中国工厂资本十亿元，大二十五倍。
    日本投降后，美帝国主义代替了日本独占中国。美国首先是帮助蒋介石匪帮去劫收日本在华资产，同时以“救济”、“援华”、“合作”等等名义帮助国民党政府庞大借款和物资，然后命令国民党军队去替它屠杀中国人民，美国从而取得一切军政财经大权，国民党政府垂手贴耳听其指挥。美国这种物质和金钱的政治经济投资，照“白皮书”的话，是占国民党政府的“金钱支出的百分之五十以上”，其中，在军事方面，供给了国民党政府的“军需品的大部分”。美国垄断了整个国民党区域的进出口贸易，美国商品象排山倒海的冲到中国来，几乎使整个国民党区域的工业陷于垮台。此外，国民党的资源委员会，和其各部委、省市及官僚们所办的工厂、矿山、铁路，都或参加美国资本、或借款，或则技术上原料器材上依靠美国。而所有能够用来制造军用品的中国稀有金属矿产如钨、锑、锡、铝、汞等都要输送到美国去用以偿债。由此可见美帝国主义的掠夺本质完全与日本一模一样，都是以屠杀、抢劫的办法使中国变为它的殖民地。不过在形式上表现得更为狡猾、阴险、毒辣，它不象日本那样直接出兵而是出钱出枪，叫国民党政府出人屠杀中国人民，它不象日本那样直接出面经略中国工矿铁路，而是以“合作”的名义进行垄断掠夺。
    三、军事的、封建的、买办的官僚资本的垄断
    中国官僚以屠杀人民为目的，用强制的方法，掠夺人民财富开办工厂，在一八六二年已有李鸿章创立上海制炮局。这些官办工厂，其器材、技术都是依靠帝国主义的，但这时的官僚资本，力量很微弱，它还不能够垄断工业任何一部门。
    以蒋、孔、宋、陈四大家族为首的官僚资本，继承并发扬这旧有的反动黑暗面，特别是利用抗日战争时期的困难环境，形成了垄断独占的地位。嗣后更因劫收了敌伪庞大产业，垄断独占的面积更渗入各种工业部门和各种有利可图的事业。如象重工业部门的矿山、冶炼、电力、电器，轻工业的纺织、面粉、制糖、造纸印刷，交通部门的铁道、航空、轮船、邮电、公路以及金融、信托、保险、仓库、住宅和进出口贸易等等，可以说无所不包，无孔不入。而在这些事业中，以中、中、交、农、四行两局的金融事业为其最高的集中点，四大家族以这殖民地化的金融资本进而垄断工业、交通、贸易等部门。以工业产量而论，根据官方的统计，一九四七年资源委员会经营的事业占全国比重计：电力占百分之六十三，煤百分之三十三，钢铁百分之九十，钨矿百分之一百，锡百分之七十，水泥百分之四十五，糖百分之九十。如果加上国民党各部会、各省、党、团以及表面“民营”，实际官办的企业，所占的比重当然更大了。从职工方面而论，据李紫翔统计，在一九四四年时光是四大家族垄断的“国营”工厂就占当时国民党统治区职工总数百分之二十九点二。从资本方面看，据经济周报廿八期统计官办企业占全部产业资本百分之八十以上。
    这是异常庞大的垄断，不过这种垄断的官僚资本与帝国主义的垄断资本有许多不同的地方，这种官僚资本从其始创直到崩溃以前，一直是依靠帝国主义，而成为帝国主义附庸的一部分。如众所周知的，国民党政府官僚资本最大系统之一的资源委员会，创立时的资本来源，是以稀有金属矿物向美国借来的，其最初创办的事业如“钨铁厂与德方合作，炼钢厂与德美两方合作，炼油厂及氮气厂与德方合作，机器厂与美及瑞士两方合作、电工器材厂与德美三方合作”（见钱昌照两年来创办重工业之经过及感想）。日本投降后官办工厂如电力、钢铁、石油、化工、煤矿、电器、制糖等事业，在技术上，或在器材上，或在资本上都是以美国做靠山的。所以这种官僚资本带有浓厚的买办性，成为美帝国主义的在华代理人，它是从美帝国主义那里捞点买办利润。
    官僚资本还带有军事的、封建的性格，这就是说，官僚企业如资源委员会、兵工署，从开始到其崩溃以前都是着重军需品的生产，而为反人民的内战服务的。这种官僚资本代表的是大买办、大资产阶级、大地主的利益，视经营企业是发财工具，它利用政治上当权的地位，以强制的方法非常野蛮的掠夺工人、农民及其他劳动人民以及压迫自由资产阶级，而积累起巨量的财富。此外，官僚资本又带有极端的腐朽性，它除了窒息私营工业的发展，其本身的管理和经营都是非常腐败的。
    四、生产手段部门比重的异常微弱
    根据“中国国民所得”这本书的材料统计，一九三三年，包括中外工厂，生产总值为二，○七六，三二二千元，生产手段部门仅有三六○，八○一千元，占总数不过百分之十七。生产手段的主要部门——机械制造业更是少得可怜，它仅占总产值百分之零点九。如果加上矿业产值三六七，四三九千元，合共才七二八，二四○千元，亦不过占总值百分之三十。
    在抗日战争时期，由于海口被封锁，生产手段部门的生产曾经有相当大的发展。但在“胜利”后，国民党政府认为一切都是美国的好，“一切需要美式化”“月亮也是美国的好”，对于曾经支持抗战发展起来的私营重工业，听任其受当时经济危机之摧残。日本帝国主义在中国统治期间，本遗留相当大一部分重工业，然而，国民党政府却乘机攫取这些工厂，视为独占发财和进行内战的工具。对于轻工业不特没有适当的配合，且以窒息民族工业为能事。复由于经营腐败的结果，战后生产手段部门的生产并没有显著的增加，有些地方如上海，反有减少的趋势。
    偏重于消费性的生产，生产手段部门不发达，是旧中国工业积弱原因之一，使旧中国不可能有国防力量，而在经济上、技术上不得不依赖帝国主义，中国工业成为外国的商品销售场所，或是半制品的加工场，乃至是帝国主义的原料取给地。
    五、技术与经营的落后
    象鞍山钢铁厂、小丰满发电厂、中纺公司那样较具规模的工厂，在我国是屈指可数的，旧中国工业的特点是，一方面大工业集中了庞大产量和巨量的工人，这些工业绝大部分为四大家族官僚资本所掌握。另一方面广泛地存在着为数众多设备简陋的小工厂，以机械工业而言，一九四八年上海的机器厂共有六四三家，有工具机八，五○九部，其中设有工具机一至九部的，共有四二○家，十部至一九部的一二八家，二十部至五十九部的不过七四家，六十部以上的更少，只有二三家，可见小工厂占绝大优势。
    纺织业是我国最具规模的工业，据王达调查，一九三六年天津中国五大纱厂资本共计仅一千五百余万元，平均每厂仅三百零六万余元，与当时资本最少之日本日清纺织公司资本一千六百余万元比较，五个厂才抵得上日本一家厂，如与日本长畸纺织公司五千三百八十万元比较，更显得微少。机械工业资本更是弱少，据日本翻译的材料，战前最大的“大隆”工厂，资本才有五十万元，当时全国七百五十三家工厂，共有资本数七百八十三万余元，每家平均仅有一万余元的资本。
    旧中国私营工业资本组织形式，大部分是独资和合伙经营，据一九三三年统计，这两种组织形式占总数百分之六十六，这种组织限制了资金大量的筹集，原料来源又不容易，捐税杂费开支浩大，因此，在资本的分配上不得不偏重购囤原料与应付杂支，固定资本的设备增添，不得不因陋就简，这种情况特别是随着国民党政府高税政策，通货膨胀，四大家族为首的投机操纵增长起来。
    在这种情况下，中国工厂在设备上不得不极其简陋，从平均数来看，在一九四七年经济部主要城市调查一万四千零七十八个工厂中，雇佣了六八二、三九九个工人，使用八二七、二七二匹马力，使用一六二、二一一千伏安电力。平均每家工厂只有四十八个工人，使用五八匹马力，十一个千伏安电力，每个工人使用的马力仅有一点二匹，零点二千伏安电力。但在一九一○年德国每一个工人可使用三点九匹马力，法国（一九一一年）可使用二点八匹，美国（一九○八年）可使用三点六匹，俄国在第一次世界大战前每一个工农合计也有一点五匹。
    官营工厂设备虽然比较不同，但在只知刮削破坏的国民党官僚们的经营下，原有的设备也是日趋败坏，中纺公司是每年赚得大笔垄断利润的工厂，但国民党政府经营了这许多年，设备上始终没有增添改进，“在接收之初，政府就始终不曾以发展工业的心来滋润中纺，中纺在政府的眼中好比是一颗摇钱树”（见一九四八年中纺副经理卢统之语）。这两年，国民党政府知道快要垮台，更是变本加厉的作破坏性的开工，这帮匪徒们撤退之前，总是大肆破坏机件器材。
    一些较小的工厂，其设备和组织更是简陋，笔者在一个中等城市看到一些这些小工厂，往往是租赁二三间房子，摆上些简单工具，收集一大堆五花八门的旧配件和原料，而且多数是学徒多于工人，短工多于长工，厂长往往是经理兼监工或是参加作活，厂长的爱人除了奶小孩还要兼做会计，甚至做招待顾客的售货员，或帮助大司务工作，这些房子毫无卫生设备，既是作活的地方，又是售货的门面。这是旧中国工业发展困难的结果，小资产阶级用以减低成本的一种办法。
    不但如此，旧中国新设之工厂，其机件设备大多数是盘旧有的，或一部新购，全部新设备的不可多见，因此，这些机件设备大都是过时老朽之物，比如中纺公司是较新式的，但其机件距今已用了十多年了。战前七省华商纱厂调查了四十一家纺织厂，其中机件使用二十年以内的就占百分之七十左右。而且这些机件大都是七凑八拼的，有一位作者这样写道：“工具则国产者非常微少，工作母机子机虽均有出产，但均属小型，能由一厂供给者则绝无仅有，必须七拼八凑始有可能，好多稍具规模的厂，确是很有趣的一部动力设备，有的部分是德国货、有的部分则又是美国的、或者英国的、比国的，所以使用起来多有困难，零件的配备便是一件不容易的工作”（一九四四年十月十二日商务日报）。
    显然，这种简劣的设备，势必减低生产效能，增高成本，出品低劣。以效率言，根据巫宝三，汪馥荪二氏统计，我国工厂工人生产效率，只等于美国工人十九分之一。又据专家估计，战前八个矿工才能抵得上一个美国矿工，在纱厂里八个中国男工才等于一个美国女工，三十个中国男工才抵得上一个美国男工。
    如上所述，旧中国工业无论就资本、设备、生产效率，都比其他资本主义国家低。同一样的工厂，所雇的工人并不比人家少，工时比人家长，童工、包身工制大大盛行，工人生活异常恶化，种种式式的额外剥削甚重，工人福利设备简直谈不到，凡此种种都说明，中国资产阶级为了与外国竞争，减低其成本，追求利润，所用的主要办法是加强对劳动者的剥削，这种剥削率在战前，大约是百分之二百至二百五十，比起外国来就高得多。因此，也就使中国无产阶级养成坚强的斗争性。
    在这里附带说一下旧中国工业管理上的缺点，以国民党官办工厂为例，这类工厂大都是机构庞大，因人设职，而不是因事设人，有不少的人是靠裙带门窗吃饭，非生产的人员和职员占的比例很大，组织机构往往与生产脱节，人事上则互相推诿牵掣、铺张、贪污、浪费、散漫松懈、效率低微、成本高、产品少，是它们的通病。有一些好的管理人员，在这种风气之下，也无法发挥其作用。这些官办工厂是以免税免捐及依靠独占利润等种种特权来支持的。这种例子，多得不胜枚举，这里不多赘了。
    六、对外的依赖性
    最近参观了一个展览室，里面摆着一部过去国民党资源委员会天津电工材料厂出品的收音机装置过程，这个过程告诉人们怎样一步步的安装成一部收音机。机器倒是灵巧，式样也美观，但经引导的同志介绍，才知道这部收音机，所有的零件，从真空管到一根铜线，一颗螺丝钉，都是从美国运来的，甚至连图样、安装的位置，安装的办法，都是预先从美国印好做好的，这些零件、图样，说明书运到中国后，只要按照它的指示，装上去就成一部美好的收音机了，你看，美国人替我们想得多么周到！？
    一位同志发问：
    “为什么不在美国完全装好后运来呢？”
    乙答：“因为中国工钱便宜呀！”
    这就是帝国主义资本掠夺的秘密，从这里也可以看到旧工业对外依赖之深。这种对外依赖性完全是帝国主义及其走狗官僚资本所做成的，如上所述的无线电零件，有些是中国本来可以制造的，但官僚资本宁肯买外国货而并不愿意设法发展本国工业。如棉花、布匹、麦子、面粉、羊毛等等原为中国大量出产或可改良的原料和日用品，每年也靠外国大批的输入，象解放前的上海纱厂有百分之九十九是用的美国棉花。战前，上海面粉厂每年需用的小麦原料有一半是靠外国供给的，这种对外依赖性逐年增大，以棉花而论，一九三六年输入只有８１３，８０８市担，到了一九四六年便增至６，８９１，２３０市担，与此同时，我国棉产区如陕西、四川等地棉农因棉花官价收购过低，把棉田改种其它作物。这是一方面。另一方面，由于中国工业本身互不配合和技术上的落后，许多宝贵的原料却运到外国去，外国人利用我廉价原料，制成各种半制品或制品，行销我国，获取高额利润。例如钨砂、锑矿、铁砂等每年都有大批出口，但中国所需的钨丝、合金钢，和较大的机械，则需仰赖外国供给。所以曾经有人说，旧中国工业不过是装备工业（即以外国的零件装配成为机器），或加工工业（即以外国之原料加工制成用品），这话并不过份的。
    东北有丰富的粮食和工业原料，蕴藏巨量的煤铁，具有东亚著名的鞍山钢铁厂，抚顺、阜新等工矿，交通发达，电力充足，解放后的东北有其远大的发展前途，它是将来中国重工业之领导地带。但在日本统治时期的东北却又是另一种情况，日本帝国主义经营东北的意图，“东北经济小丛书”有这么一些描写：“伪满时代，东北经济与日本经济之关系，极为密切，严如一体，因而双方采取分工合作办法，即东北以开发工业资源为重点，而日本则以高度技术之制品工业为重点”。“查伪满机械工业之不振，系由于屡受日本压制之故，虽亦有一部分机械工厂，然仅形同日本机械工业之代理商店，故设备及技术等，亦未能脱离此种范围；由此可知，当初日本机械工业之进出东北，其目的惟在获得该项工业之市场而已”。“伪满时代之东北，因系日本轻工业货品之市场，同时又专以开发重工业是务，所有资材、资金、劳力等，均不拨与轻工业方面使用，以致东北之轻工业益趋不振，嗣因日本需要战争物资多而且急，其输向东北之轻工业品，当然减少；此时伪满政府不但不奖励轻工业，以谋生产，反而实行配售制度，以抑制消费，其用意所在，不外拟其全力于重工业，以冀战争之好转，于是东北轻工业，唯有走向凋落之一途”。
    这是一幅鲜明的殖民地经济图画，这种经营殖民地的方法与第一次世界大战前有些不同，日本侵略者是使这个殖民地成为它的扩张政策的军事原料基地，所用的方法是便于少数垄断资本家掠夺的“统制经济”，大部分的中国劳动者是用绳子捆来的，这些劳动者的生活与奴隶没有很大区别，所以这种办法是更疯狂，更野蛮，更富于血腥的侵略性。日本投降以来，美国在中国在台湾所作所为尽量的模仿日本这一套办法，但是正如日本法西斯蒂终于灭亡那样，美国侵略者是会得到报应的。
    七、集中在几个殖民地化的都市
    根据经济部一九四七年发表的二十个主要城市调查材料，其中上海即集中了七，七三八家工厂，占总数一四，○七八家百分之五十四，工人数三六七，四三三人，占总数六八二，三九九人百分之五十四。天津工厂数占总数百分之九，工人数占总数百分之八。此外，青岛厂数和工人数占总数百分之三，广州厂数和工人数也占百分之三。即以这四个沿海城市而论，厂数就占全国百分之七十，工人数占全国百分之六十九。这正是半殖民地中国工业的特点。
    这种地域上的偏枯，对于国防上、工业成本、供应上都是不利的，并且使我们广大的内地陷于穷困凋落之境。
    八、工业只为少数上层阶级服务
    中国社会既然是广大的农民小生产者占优势，这些农民小生产者复在帝国主义、官僚资本主义、封建主义残酷压迫榨取下失掉其购买力，中国工业对内既失去其广大的市场，对外复因技术上的落后无法与诸先进资本主义国家竞争，只好转而为少数人服务。一位作者对于这点道出了当时国民党区域的客观情况，他说：“我国当前工业生产的消费对象，仅限于都市及都市附近的人民，都市之中且以中层人士为主，所以产品的市场很少，在抗战期中，就特别显出它的弱点来”。“我国工业的产品在上层人士的眼中，是不合消费水准的劣货，在农村中的农民看来，却又是过分的奢侈品，当其主要消费对象——城市中层阶级因通货膨胀而消失大部购买力之后，这种工业的基础就发生动摇而难于支持了”。（见向光沅：“当前工商业的出路”一九四四年二月六日新蜀报。）
    上海是我国最大的一个轻工业城市，据一九四八年工业研究所发表的调查材料看来，在那里制造雪茄烟、绸缎、驼绒、手帕、赛璐璐、热水瓶、钢窗、铜铁床、罐头、调味粉等工厂约莫有三千个，占全沪总厂数三分之一左右，其工人数占全沪总数四分之一还多，这些产品在广大的农民和劳苦群众看来真是无福享受的“奢移品”。此外，以我国较发达的棉纺织业而论，“在一九四七年缴与国民党联勤总部的棉纱共七千件，棉布三百多万匹，三十八年的预算，棉布要缴四百多万匹，棉纱八千件，其中有百分之六十以上是上海工厂纺织的，上海的面粉厂，从一九四七年八月至一九四八年二月代国民党粮食部磨制面粉二百六十万包，占全部产量百分之六十，上海许多中小橡胶厂则代军队制造跑鞋，每次定货恒在数百万双以上。大中华橡胶厂的汽车轮胎，也大部售与国民党政府，此外，若干机器厂并代国民党兵工署制造军器零件。”
    为区区少数资产阶级、官僚、自由职业者、乡村少数地主富农服务，乃是旧中国工业特征。
    九、解放后的改造与建设
    上面的叙述告诉我们，旧中国工业必须全盘改造。中国工业的新生，只有依靠于新民主主义的革命，实行解放农民，没收官僚资本，取消帝国主义的特权。
    改造半殖民地半封建的旧工业结构使之变为新民主主义的经济结构，这是一个异常艰苦繁重长期的工作，我们从报章杂志的零碎消息中，可以看到，这种改造工作，在我解放了的地区，已逐步进行并已获得辉煌的效果。最近由于美帝国主义及其走狗国民党政府的封锁，更加促进其改造。
    我军解放了的城市，从解放第一天起，即宣布没收了官僚资本，废除国民党一切反动经济政策，取消帝国主义在华各种特权，并定出为发展生产繁荣经济的公私兼顾、劳资两利、城乡互助的各种经济政策。
    我们可以看到，被国民党匪帮破坏了的公营工厂，和在广大职工保护而未遭破坏的工厂，在异常困难的条件下恢复了生产，取消了官僚制度，职工们并发挥了创造性，发明了许多代用品，改造了机器，进行合理的劳动组织，节省了原料器材，并创造了一套民主管理办法。因此，这些公营工厂一般的说，生产效率是超过国民党时代，成本也较国民党时期减少了许多，职工的生活，职工间的团结也较国民党时期改善。工人阶级已处于国家主人翁的地位了。
    具有重大作用的是我解放区着重生产手段部门的发展，特别是东北最近扩大机械工业的生产，这就使冶炼出来的巨量钢铁，经过机械工业这座桥梁，供给轻重工业和农业所需的设备，使整个工业部门有机的配合起来，达到自给自足的目的，并在这个基础上改善我们的装备，扩大生产。
    我们有些地区如大连，工业组织重新改编，把许多性质相同，又互相有关的工厂，编成一个大的工业公司，若干公司上设总管理处。因此，节省了许多人力财力，为生产臻于合理化和提高生产效率提供了基础。
    我们的公私营工厂都改变了生产，使之为广大内地市场服务，偏枯于沿海大城市的一些工厂，也准备就原料，就市场，迁移到内地去，这样就使工业和农业、工业与工业互相的配合，互相推动发展，并促进交通、商业、金融的发展，繁荣内地经济。
    此外，解放区的金融、贸易、运输交通、税收等经济机构，都是竭尽一切力量帮助生产的发展，这与国民党统治时期完全两样，在国民党政府统治时期，这些机构是专门窒息私营工业，为官僚资本吸吮人民的膏血。
    这些材料是很不完全的，从这简单的材料看来，在共产党领导下的新中国工业，完全换了一个崭新的姿态，向着光明远大的道路前进。（附图片）
