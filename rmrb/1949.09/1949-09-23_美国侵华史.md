A History of American Aggression Against China
Liu Danian
3. Striving for Hegemony in China (Continued from XXII)
    By the 21st of the same month, Hull further invited the Chinese Ambassador to the United States, Wang Zhengting, to meet with the Japanese Ambassador, Saito, expressing that if China and Japan went to war, the United States "felt a serious concern" and was willing to "do its bit for the cause of peace." On August 10th of the same year, the State Department gave the following instruction to Ambassador Grew in Japan:
    "Informally suggest to the Japanese government that the United States mediate the settlement of disputes between China and Japan. In this proposed plan, propose a neutral location where representatives from China and Japan can meet for negotiations, and provide assistance to adjust any difficulties that may arise during the negotiations." (Note: Ibid., p. 71)
    This was the United States' attempt to suppress China's resistance and instruct Chiang Kai-shek to compromise with Japan. However, by this time, the Chinese people's demand for resistance against Japan had become unstoppable for the American aggressors. Japan also did not respond to the above "peace" proposal from the United States. It was then that the United States realized that the two-pronged policy of making concessions to Japan on the one hand to encourage Japan to oppose the Soviet Union, and on the other hand, restricting Japan's rapid advance into China, was "of no avail." It then changed its attitude and adopted a method roughly similar to that during the Chinese Revolution, that is, to let the war continue, using Japan to extinguish the flames of the Chinese revolution. Similarly, it would in turn use the power of the Chinese people to weaken Japan. Therefore, it let Chiang Kai-shek temporarily shelve the plan to completely eliminate the Communist Party and had his army join the war against Japan for a time, while it put on a hypocritical face of "strict neutrality." The US government issued successive statements on August 23, September 14, and October 6 of the same year: "The United States does not attempt to make a judgment on the merits of the dispute..." "The question of applying the Neutrality Act remains as it is..." Later, it even withdrew the US troops that had been "stationed" in China for forty years.

  　三　争夺中国霸权　（续二十二）
    至同月二十一日，赫尔更邀请蒋驻美大使王正廷与日大使斋藤会面，表示中日两国开战，美国“感觉重大之关切”，愿对“和平目标稍尽棉薄”。同年八月十日，国务院又给驻日大使格鲁这样一个训令：
    “向日本政府非正式建议由美国出面斡旋中日两国纠纷之解决，在此一建议计划之中，提出一处中立地点，由中日两国代表在该处会见进行谈判，并作种种协助，以调整在谈判中可能发生之困难。”（注：同前书，七一页）
    这是美国仍想压制中国抗战，指使蒋介石对日妥协的作法，但此时中国人民的抗日要求，已使美国侵略者无法遏止，日本对美国上项“和平”建议，也并无反响，美国这才发现一面对日让步，鼓励日本反苏，一面又限制日本向中国急进的两面政策已“无济于事”。便改变态度，采取了与中国大革命时大致相同的办法，即让这个战争打下去，借日本扑灭中国革命火焰，同样，反过来又借中国人民力量削弱日本，故让蒋介石暂时搁置全面消灭共产党的计划，而把他的军队一度加入对日作战，自己却搬出一个“严守中立”的伪装面孔，美政府于同年八月二十三日，九月十四日，十月六日连续发表声明：“美国并未企图对争论之是非曲直下一判断……”，“适用中立法之问题仍维持原状……”。以后更把在中国“留驻”了四十年的美军撤出去。
