　　After a Month of Hard Study in Factories,
  　Three Hua University Cultural Work Teams Return to School
    [This newspaper reported] The Third, Fourth, and Fifth Teams of the Third Cultural Work Troupe of Hua University left Beijing on the 14th of last month for practical training in factories in Tianjin, Changxindian, and Shijingshan. They all returned to school on the 16th of this month. The teams departed on the 14th of last month. The Third Cultural Work Team in Tianjin performed successively at Nankai University, various factories of the China Textile Corporation, the Railway Workers' Union, the Water Company, the Paper Mill, the Steel Plant, and the East Asia Tobacco Company. At the East Asia Tobacco Company, they also helped resolve labor-management disputes. Later, they went to the Navigation Engineering Team in Xingang Tanggu and the Dagu Shipyard to perform for the workers, receiving a warm welcome and high praise. The Fourth Cultural Work Team helped railway workers with their work in Changxindian and also attended the public trial of the special agent Wang Yujie by the Military Control Commission's Military Law Department. The Fifth Cultural Work Team was at the Shijingshan Power Plant and Steel Plant. For the first half of the month, they performed. For the second half of the month, they had get-togethers with the workers, visited the workers and their families to understand the workers' lives, and learned from the workers. The students of the music groups of the Third, Fourth, and Fifth Cultural Work Teams taught the workers to sing in the hot sun. Many students lost their voices and developed sores on their feet, but they still taught the workers to sing and do the Yangko dance. During this internship, they all fully demonstrated their enthusiasm for serving the masses. At the same time, they also understood the feelings of the proletariat, learned the workers' organization and discipline, and learned how to get close to the workers. (Hua)
