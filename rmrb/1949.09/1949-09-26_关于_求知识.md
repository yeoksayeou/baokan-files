　　On "Seeking Knowledge"
    Tian Min
    Recently, while studying the history of social development with many students who have just graduated from school, I have found a common idea among them. They believe that studying Marxist-Leninist theory is merely a simple "seeking of knowledge," and they understand "seeking knowledge" as simply "knowing about it." Studying the evolution from ape to human, studying the five modes of production, they only want to know some historical facts in the process of human social development, thinking that knowing it is enough, or at most, knowing it in more detail is enough. Therefore, they are often satisfied with knowing some historically listed facts, fragmented conclusions, satisfied with reading some books, listening to several reports, thinking that "knowledge" lies in this, and are unwilling to deeply excavate their own thoughts with the weapon of theory, connect with reality, and solve the current practical problems. Some even say: "I have read the history of social development several times, it's always the same things." They become unhappy when asked to study it again.
    Knowing many historical facts of human society in the past, reading some books on the history of social development, is necessary, but merely being satisfied with this inevitably leads to looking down on the working people, being arrogant, not trusting the masses, wavering in their stance and blurring their views when observing problems, even if they memorize some dogmas, know some historical facts, these "knowledge" becomes merely a "burden" for their own appreciation. It cannot play any role in practical life.
    Learning is for seeking knowledge, that's right. However, what is knowledge? This question must be clarified. Chairman Mao told us that there are two kinds of knowledge: one is the knowledge of the struggle for production, and the other is the knowledge of the class struggle. This means that knowledge must become the power of actual struggle in human society to be called true knowledge. Therefore, studying the history of social development is not merely about memorizing some dead things, but about clarifying the laws of social development, clarifying the role of the working masses in history, clarifying the social laws of class struggle, and then, deeply excavating many facts in their past thoughts that belittle labor, belittle the masses, and have blurred class viewpoints, bravely exposing them, criticizing them with theory, cleansing them, thereby establishing a correct outlook on life of serving the working people, standing on the position of the proletariat and the masses of the people in actual life and work. In this way, our theory can become a weapon, our knowledge can become a force, becoming true living knowledge.
    Among young students, because of the influence of the old education, the idea that knowing the things in books is considered having "knowledge" is still quite common, and many are not good at bravely exposing their wrong ideas, using the theoretical knowledge they have learned to criticize and cleanse them. We should seriously correct this biased and incorrect understanding of "knowledge." We must make it clear that knowledge is not only "knowing" some things, but also using these known things to carefully connect and check our own thoughts, connect with actual struggle, in order to become true knowledge. Here, Comrade Ai Siqi's article "Starting from Scratch" recently published in "Study" magazine is worth recommending for everyone to study together.

### 关于“求知识”

　　关于“求知识” 
    田敏
    最近和许多刚从学校出来的同学在一起学习社会发展史，发现同学中有一种很普遍的想法，认为学习马列主义的理论，只是简单的“求知识”，而且把“求知识”仅仅了解为“知道知道”就够了。学习从猿到人，学习五种生产方式，却不过只是想知道知道人类社会发展过程中的一些历史事实，知道了就行了，或者至多是知道得更详细些就行了。因此，他们常常满足于知道了一些历史上罗列的史实，片断的结论，满足于看过一些书，听过几个报告，以为“知识”就在于此，而不肯用理论的武器来深深发掘自己的思想，联系实际，解决目前的实际问题，有的甚至说：“社会发展史，我看过好几遍了，说来说去就是那些东西。”叫他再学，便不高兴。
    知道知道人类社会过去的许多史实，看一些社会发展史的书籍，是必要的，但仅仅如此，便以为满足，结果势必至学完了社会发展史，而仍然眼睛朝上，看不起劳动人民，自高自大，不相信群众，在观察问题时，立场动摇，观点模糊，纵然背诵了一些教条，知道了一些史实，而这些“知识”却成了仅仅供自己欣赏的“包袱”。对于实际生活起不了什么作用。
    学习是为了求知识，对的。然而，知识是什么？这一个问题必须明确，毛主席告诉我们，知识有两种：一种是生产斗争的知识，一种是阶级斗争的知识，这就是说知识必须成为人类社会实际斗争的力量，才能叫真正的知识。因此学习社会发展史，就不仅仅在于记一些死东西，而是要明确社会发展的规律，明确劳动群众在历史上的作用，明确阶级斗争的社会法则，然后，深入的发掘过去自己思想中轻视劳动，轻视群众，阶级观点模糊的许多事实，勇敢的暴露它们，用理论批判它们，清洗它们，从而建立正确的为劳动人民服务的人生观，在实际的生活与工作中，站在无产阶级人民大众的立场，这样我们的理论才能成为一种武器，我们的知识才能成为一种力量，成为真正的活的知识。
    在青年同学中，因为受旧教育的影响，以为知道了书本上的东西便算有“知识”的想法还相当普遍，还有不少人不善于勇敢的暴露自己的错误思想，用所学的理论知识来批判它们清洗它们。我们应该严肃的纠正这种关于“知识”的偏＠的不正确的了解，必须明确，知识不仅是“知道了”一些东西，而是要把这些知道的东西，很好的联系检查自己的思想，联系实际的斗争，才能成为真正的知识，这里，艾思奇同志最近在学习杂志上发表的从头学起一文，是值得介绍大家共同学习的。
