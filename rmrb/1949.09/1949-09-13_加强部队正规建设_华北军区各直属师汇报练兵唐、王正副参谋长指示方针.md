Strengthen the Regular Construction of the Troops
Various Directly Subordinate Divisions of the North China Military Region Report on Military Training, Tang and Wang, Chief and Deputy Chiefs of Staff, Give Instructions on the Guiding Principles

[This newspaper report] At the beginning of the month, at the military training reporting conference of the various directly subordinate divisions of the North China Military Region, Chief of Staff Tang reported on "Strengthening the Regularization of the Troops," and Deputy Chief of Staff Wang reported on "The Guidelines and Requirements of Military Education," instructing the general policy of the current regularization of the North China People's Liberation Army and the implementation of ideological and military education, which is also the current policy of troop work and leadership.

Chief of Staff Tang pointed out: Regularization is proposed in response to the requirements of the struggle situation and regular warfare. It is manifested in the issues of raising, training, leading, and using troops, all of which must have a unified and integrated set of regulations to meet the requirements of large-scale regular warfare. In conjunction with the regulations of various military regions and the instructions of the Military Commission and the Central Committee in the past, this is not an empty new issue. Its content mainly includes (1) Unification: The organization, military flag, military emblem, clothing, etc., must have unified regulations. The purpose is to cultivate consistency in the will of the troops, that is, to unify under the will of the Military Commission. (2) Organization and Discipline: Orders and instructions from superiors can only be studied for how to execute them; a strict system of requesting instructions and reporting is required; life, study, training grounds, dining halls, dormitories, etc., must have rules and regulations, and things must be done according to the rules, in order to cultivate collective habits. (3) Seriousness: All orders and instructions require us to consciously and loyally execute them. Checking the implementation of policies, opposing disorganization and indiscipline, and promoting criticism and self-criticism are all issues of seriousness. Chief of Staff Tang further pointed out: Strict discipline is about accurately executing orders and regulations and all stipulations, not putting on a stern face, hitting and scolding people, or arbitrarily punishing people. Today, while emphasizing regularization, we must also pay attention to promoting democracy and following the mass line in the troops, and prevent the growth of warlordism.

Secondly, regarding improving the political morale of the troops and strengthening management and education, Chief of Staff Tang, in addition to pointing out that political education should be strengthened in the future, also mentioned that in a relatively peaceful and stable environment, management methods should be improved, supplies should be improved (within the supply standards), sports activities should be developed, and cultural standards should be raised. The request is to truly make the troops a university from the perspective of management and education. In standardized training, Chief of Staff Tang emphasized strengthening the education of cadres (especially platoon and company cadres), studying the manuals, and studying the essentials of movements and teaching methods.

Deputy Chief of Staff Wang, in his report on "The Guidelines and Requirements of Military Education," explained that the draft education plan stipulated by the North China Military Region, its guidelines and general spirit are: (1) A "uniform" and "systematic" education policy, which is very different from the previous "learn and use immediately" and "strike-force"-focused education policy based on the needs of the task. This phase of the education plan starts with various basic training, progresses step by step from individuals to squads to platoons, and gradually improves education, so that every cadre and soldier can master various movements in the manual, be proficient in the use of various weapons, and be proficient in various lifestyle habits of soldiers that are different from those of other people. (2) Strengthen the organization and discipline of the troops. Ordinary "standardized training" is called "military discipline training," and its meaning is to instill the discipline of the army and cultivate the habit of obeying discipline in training. (3) Cultivate a regular style of unified concentration in large corps, strengthen the overall concept of the troops, overcome certain remaining local concepts and departmentalism, as well as residual guerrilla tactics and guerrilla habits.

After explaining the guidelines and spirit, Deputy Chief of Staff Wang called on the leadership to clearly recognize this spirit ideologically, grasp this spirit, and implement this spirit in order to successfully complete the first phase of the military education plan and lay the foundation and convenient conditions for a more advanced military education in the next phase.

　　加强部队正规建设
    华北军区各直属师汇报练兵唐、王正副参谋长指示方针
    【本报讯】月初华北军区各直属师练兵汇报会议上，唐参谋长报告“加强部队正规化的建设”，王副参谋长报告“军事教育的方针与要求”，指示了当前华北解放军建设正规化，进行思想教育和军事教育的总方针，也就是当前部队工作和领导的方针。
    唐参谋长指出：正规化，这是在斗争形势的要求与正规作战的情况下提出来的。它表现在养兵、练兵、带兵、用兵诸问题上，都要有一个整体的统一的规定，才能适合大兵团的正规作战要求。与各军区的规定，军委、中央过去的指示等联系起来，并不是什么空洞的新问题。它的内容主要包括（一）统一性：编制、军旗、军徽、服装等，都要有统一的规定。目的是为了养成部队意志上的一致性，即统一在军委意志之下。（二）组织性纪律性：上级的命令、指示，只能研究怎样去执行；要求严格的请示报告制度；生活、学习、操场、饭堂、宿舍等都要有规则，按规则办事，借以养成集体的习惯。（三）严肃性：一切命令指示，要求我们自觉忠诚的去执行。对政策执行的检查，反对无组织无纪律，与发扬批评与自我批评等都是严肃性的问题。唐参谋长更指出：严格纪律，是准确执行命令与条令及一切规定，并不是板起面孔，打人骂人，随便处罚人。在强调正规化的今天，还要注意部队中发扬民主，走群众路线，防止军阀主义的滋长。
    其次，关于提高部队政治情绪，加强管理教育，唐参谋长除指出今后应加强政治教育外，还谈及在相对和平稳定的环境，应改进管理方法，改善给养（在供给标准内改善），开展体育运动，提高文化水准，要求从管理教育上真正使部队成为一个大学校。在制式教练中，唐参谋长强调加强干部（特别是排连干部）的教育，研究操典，研究动作要领和教授方法。
    王副参谋长在“军事教育的方针与要求”的报告中，说明华北军区所规定的教育计划草案，其方针与总的精神为：（一）是“齐一的”“系统的”教育方针，与以往根据任务的需要，“马上学马上用”的突击的重点式的教育方针有很大的区别。这期教育计划由各个的基本教练作起，由各个而班而排按步就班的进行有步骤的逐步提高的教育，使每个干部、战士都能熟练制式中的各种动作，熟练于使用各种武器，熟练于军人的各种不同于其他人的生活习惯。（二）加强部队的组织性与纪律性。普通称“制式教练”为“军纪教练”，其涵义是为了灌输军队的纪律性，在教练中养成遵守纪律的习惯。（三）养成大兵团统一集中的正规作风，加强部队的整体观念，克服某些残存着的局部观念与本位观念以及残余的游击作风与游击习气。
    王副参谋长于讲完方针、精神后，号召领导思想上应该明确认识这种精神掌握这种精神与贯彻这种精神。以求圆满完成第一期军教计划，打下下一期更加提高的军事教育基础与便利条件。
