　　Shanghai Branch of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association
  　Holds Evening Reception in Memory of Pavlov
    [This newspaper Shanghai 26th dispatch] Yesterday (the 25th) was the centennial of the birth of the great Russian scholar and world-renowned physiologist Ivan Pavlov. The Shanghai branch of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association held a commemorative evening reception and published a special issue for the centennial of Pavlov's birth. The conference proceeded in a spirit of internationalism, with over a thousand guests including Rao Shushi, Secretary of the East China Bureau of the CPC; Vice Mayor Pan Hannian; Section Chief Zhang Hanfu; as well as the chairman of the Shanghai Soviet Association, Gibulovsky; and the representative of the Soviet Foreign Culture Association, Jabu Hou, and over sixty others. In his speech, Vice Mayor Pan particularly mentioned that Pavlov's discovery of conditioned reflexes not only added splendor to the Soviet scientific community, but also enhanced the brilliance of the international scientific community, greatly benefiting the medical treatment of human psychological and neurological disorders. He was a loyal pursuer of truth, who taught his students to discover the internal secrets of things and grasp the laws of their development through continuous observation. He said that this serious scientific attitude should be learned not only by all natural scientists, but also by all people engaged in social sciences and political activities, and that the spirit of new patriotism with which Pavlov loyally served his people and country should also be learned. Soviet physician Smolnikov and Shanghai physician Ge Shaolong also stated that such meetings could enhance cultural exchange between the two countries, strengthen friendship between the two countries, and called on every scientific worker to learn from Pavlov and wholeheartedly serve the people under the leadership of the Communist Party.
