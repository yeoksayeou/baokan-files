Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, September 5th: TASS reports: Yugoslav communists and non-party members exiled in the city of Ruse in northern Bulgaria discussed the Soviet government's reply to the Yugoslav government's note and the Yugoslav government's note. They passed a resolution stating that the Soviet government's reply is a document that completely exposes the Tito clique's conspiracies and duplicity in domestic and foreign policy. The Tito clique's domestic and foreign policies are implemented through disloyal agreements, appalling terror, and forceful secret police methods. The Soviet government's reply to the Yugoslav note has proven that the Yugoslav rulers have completely sided with the imperialist camp, that they have sold out the interests of the Yugoslav people to imperialism, and that they have subjected Yugoslavia to imperialist enslavement and exploitation.

　　南在保政治流亡者
　  拥护苏联照会
  　续斥铁托卖国罪行
    【新华社北平五日电】塔斯社讯：侨居在保国北部卢西城的流亡的南斯拉夫共产党人和无党派人士，讨论了苏联政府致南政府照会的复文及南斯拉夫政府的照会，并通过决议称：苏联政府的复文是完全揭露了铁托一伙在内政与外交政策上的阴谋与两面态度的文件，铁托一伙的内外政策，是通过不忠实的协定、惊人的恐怖和强力的秘密警察等手段去实行的。苏联政府致南斯拉夫照会的复文已证明：南斯拉夫的统治者完全投靠帝国主义阵营，他们把南斯拉夫人民的利益出卖给帝国主义，并且使南斯拉夫受帝国主义者的奴役和剥削。
