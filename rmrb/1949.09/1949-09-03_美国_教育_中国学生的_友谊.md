　　American "Education" of Chinese Students' "Friendship"
    Hu Sheng
    In Acheson's letter to Truman, he attempted to trace the history of Sino-American "friendship," saying, "This friendship can be proven by many years of facts, such as using the Boxer Indemnity to fund the education of Chinese students, abolishing extraterritoriality during World War II, and providing extensive aid to China during and after the war..." Before World War II, Sino-American relations had already continued for a century. Regarding the "facts" of this century, Mr. Acheson only mentioned the return of the Boxer Indemnity. He probably thought that, in any case, this matter was an expression of American "friendship" towards the Chinese people and was beyond doubt. Here, we can cite some factual material to illustrate the true nature of this matter.
    The so-called "using the Boxer Indemnity to fund the education of Chinese students" was proposed in 1906, passed in the U.S. Congress in May 1907, and began to be implemented in 1909. To understand the "good intentions" of American imperialism, one must mention the anti-American boycott movement in various parts of China in 1905.
    In the last two decades of the 19th century, the United States implemented a policy of excluding Chinese workers, and systematically carried out maltreatment and even killings of overseas Chinese everywhere. According to a petition to the Beijing government from 56,000 Chinese merchants residing in the United States in 1901, including Cui Zijian, Tang Qiongchang, He Li, and Situ Fang, the situation of Chinese people in the United States at that time was described as: "Harsh regulations abound, causing utter dismay. They are groundlessly accused of epidemics, leading to encirclements of their communities; groundlessly labeled as unclean, leading to cleansing of their communities. The state of disturbance and danger is too terrible to describe. ... When Chinese arrive at the port, regardless of whether they comply with regulations, they are imprisoned in wooden houses at the pier, where they eat and sleep in isolation. Relatives and friends are not allowed to see them, and lawyers are not allowed to question them. Even if they are ill, doctors are not allowed to examine them. The darkness and stench are worse than in prisons. Oppression and cruelty are worse than towards criminals. Hundreds are often imprisoned, and detained for several months. Their passports are shelved, and customs officials do not bother to examine them. As a result, there are tragic cases of hanging, drowning, and death due to lack of medical care. Chinese in every port are often beaten without recourse. Police officers arrest people arbitrarily, without distinguishing between good and bad, and impose heavy fines. If a Chinese dies of a common illness, their body must be mutilated. Those who flee to America from other countries are often tortured and killed if discovered. Restaurants forbid Chinese people from eating, and hotels forbid them from lodging."
    At that time, this "friendly" expression of the United States towards the Chinese people aroused widespread anger in China. In 1905, merchants in various coastal ports of China launched a movement to boycott American goods. It should be noted that the first time the Chinese people used the weapon of economic severance was against American imperialism.
    Feeling the Chinese people's hostility towards the United States, the idea of "returning the Boxer Indemnity" arose, which was called using Chinese people's own money to buy their hearts. This method was proposed by American businessmen and missionaries in China. A missionary named Arthur H. Smith was the most active in advocating this matter. He was a well-known missionary with forty years of working experience in China. He met with U.S. President Roosevelt in 1906, strongly arguing for the benefits of using the Boxer Indemnity to cultivate Chinese students to study in the United States.
    This Mr. Smith published a book in 1907 called "China and America To-day." One chapter of the book specifically discussed "America's Opportunities and Responsibilities in China," in which he devoted much space to explaining that recruiting Chinese students to the United States was an urgent matter that could not be ignored. A memorandum from E.J. James, President of the University of Illinois, to the U.S. President was quoted in full. We might as well translate a little of it, because from here we can understand their view on this matter.
    "That nation which succeeds in educating the young Chinese of the coming generation will secure the largest possible return for the effort expended in the shape of influence, both spiritual and commercial. If the United States could a generation ago have turned the current of Chinese students towards this country and have kept that current constantly increasing, we should be in a position to-day to guide the development of China in the most satisfactory and subtle of ways. This influence would result from a leadership in Chinese affairs by men educated in the best that we have to offer in the way of intellectual and spiritual guidance."
    This is the basic reason why Mr. James and his colleagues were concerned about the education of Chinese youth. In this university president's memorandum, he particularly pointed out the fact that there were already many Chinese students studying not only in Japan but also in Europe, expressing great anxiety. He said, "This means that when these Chinese return from Europe, they will cause China to emulate Europe, to emulate England, France, and Germany, rather than the United States. This means that they will recommend British, French, and German teachers and engineers to go to China to take responsible positions, rather than invite Americans. This means that British, French, and German goods will be bought instead of American goods, and various industrial privileges will be given to Europe instead of to the United States." According to the imperialists, Chinese students had so many benefits! Therefore, the United States must catch up quickly and invite as many Chinese students as possible.
    "A sum of money spent in the expansion of spiritual influence will be of more worth, even from the material point of view, than if expended in any other way. Commerce follows spiritual dominion more surely than it follows the flag." This very pragmatic university president concluded to his president in this way.
    In this way, it is worthwhile to spend some capital to attract Chinese students, so of course it is even more worthwhile to "use" the Chinese people's own money to do this. After quoting James's clever suggestion, Mr. Smith put forward his even more clever suggestion. But he worried that others would question why the "Boxer Indemnity" was originally Chinese money, and since it was being returned to China, why not return it unconditionally? Mr. Smith wrote in his book, "It is naturally very easy to say that if this money belonged to the United States, we should keep it; if it belonged to China, it should be returned to China." But Mr. Smith felt it was not difficult to explain this point, because China was made to pay this money to "punish" the Chinese people for their "offense" against the American consulate personnel in the events of 1900. Therefore, Mr. Smith said, "Our responsibility is not to return this money completely, but to use this money to make it difficult for similar events to happen again in the future." To put it more clearly, it is to use this money to wear down the Chinese people's anti-imperialist thought, in order to achieve what President James said, "to spiritually dominate" the Chinese. "Can we not, according to President James's clever suggestion, propose to the Chinese government to use this money, at least a portion of it, to educate Chinese students in the United States?" This even more clever Mr. Smith said.
    Based on the simple materials presented above, the true meaning of the "return of the Boxer Indemnity," which is still cited by Acheson as proof of Sino-American "friendship," can be clarified.
    It is said that for the American bourgeoisie, everything can be reduced to money, reduced to the debit and credit sides of the accounting books. "Friendship" is certainly no exception, and "education" is no exception either. According to that university president's estimate, the money spent to attract Chinese students would be repaid a thousandfold in just thirty years. Now, forty years have passed, and it seems that this has become a bad debt. - But wait, is not Acheson appealing to China's "democratic individualists" at this moment, trying to recover this debt from them with interest? Is this probably the reason why he specifically mentioned "using the Boxer Indemnity to fund the education of Chinese students" when reviewing the Sino-American friendship relationship?

### 美国“教育”中国学生的“友谊”

　　美国“教育”中国学生的“友谊”
    胡绳
    艾奇逊致杜鲁门信中企图追溯中美“友谊”的历史，他说：“这种友谊是可以用许多年来的种种事实予以证明的，诸如利用庚子赔款供中国学生的教育费用，在第二次世界大战期内的废除治外法权，以及战时和战后的广泛对华援助等。……”在第二次世界大战前，中美间的关系已经有过继续一百年的历史。对这一百年中的“事实”，艾奇逊先生只举出退还庚子赔款这一件事。大概他以为，无论如何，这一件事总是美国对中国人的“友谊”表示，是无可怀疑的了。我们在这里，可以举一点事实材料来说明这件事的真象。
    所谓“利用庚子赔款供中国学生教育费用”这件事起议于一九○六年，在一九○七年五月美国国会中通过，而开始实行于一九○九年。要明白美帝国主义之所以有这番“好意”，不能不说到一九○五年的中国各地抵制美货运动。
    在十九世纪最后二十年间，美国实行排斥中国工人的政策，到处有计划的进行对华侨的虐待乃至杀戮。据一九○一年寓美华商崔子肩、唐琼昌、何利、司徒芳等五万六千人向北京政府的呈文，描写当时美国对待华侨的情形是：“苛例百出，令人骇绝。无端诬以疫疠，而有围埠之举，无端目以不洁，而行洗埠之事。骚扰危险之状，惨不忍言。……华人到埠之时，不问其合例与否，即囚之于马头木屋中，寝食于斯，内外隔绝。亲友不得一见，律师不得一问。即有疾病，医生亦不得诊视。黑暗秽臭，过于监狱。压制苛暴，甚于犯人。幽囚常数百人，羁留常数阅月。而护照束阁，关吏无一过问。因此之故，有悬梁自缢，投海自尽，失医致毙之惨者。凡埠中华人，辄遇痛殴，亦无如何。巡差任意拿人，良歹不分，即遭重罚。华人以常病致死，亦须戮尸。由别国逃美，一经查出，多被刑杀。餐馆则禁华人之饮食，客店则禁华人之入宿。”
    当时美国对于中国人的这种“友好”表示，引起了中国国内普遍的愤怒。在一九○五年中国沿海各埠商人展开抵制美货的运动。大家要知道，中国人民第一次使用经济绝交的武器，就是针对美国帝国主义的。
    由于感到中国人民对美国的敌意，所以才想到“退还庚款”，这叫做，用中国自己的钱来收买中国的人心。提出这个办法的是在中国的美国商人和教士，有个叫做斯密斯（Ａｒｔｈｕｒ　Ｈ．Ｓｍｉｔｈ）的教士提倡此事最出力。这是个很著名的教士在中国有四十年的工作经验。他曾于一九○六年见美国总统罗斯福，力陈以庚款来培殖中国学生留美的好处。
    这位斯密斯先生在一九○七年出版过一本书，叫做“今日之中国与美国”（Ｃｈｉｎａ　ａｎｄ　Ａｍｅｒｉｃａ　Ｔｏ—ｄａｙ）。该书有一章专讲“美国在中国的机会与责任”，其中用很多篇幅说明罗致中国学生到美国来是当务之急，不可忽略。伊里诺大学校长詹姆士（Ｅ．Ｊ．Ｊｅｍｅｓ）给美国总统的一个备忘录被全文引录着。我们不妨摘译一点出来，因为从这里可以明白他们对于这件事的看法。
    “那一个国家能做到教育这一代的年青中国人，那一个国家就将由于这方面所支付的努力而在精神的和商业的影响上取回最大可能的收获。如果美国在三十年前已经做到把中国学生的潮流引向这一个国家来，并能使这潮流继续扩大，那么，我们现在一定能够使用最圆满和最巧妙的方式而控制中国的发展——这就是说，使用那从知识与精神上支配中国的领袖的方式。”
    这就是詹姆士先生们关心中国青年的教育问题的基本理由。在这大学校长的备忘录中特别指出那时不仅在日本，而且在欧洲都已有很多中国留学生的事实，表示十分着急，他说：“这就意味着，当这些中国人从欧洲回去后，将要使中国效法欧洲，效法英国、法国、德国，而不效法美国。这就意味着，他们将推荐英国、法国和德国的教师与工程师到中国去担任负责的地位，而不是请美国人去。这就意味着，英国、法国和德国的商品要被买去而不买美国商品，各种工业上的特权将给予欧洲而不是给予美国。”按照帝国主义者的想法，中国留学生就有那么大的好处！因此，美国必须急起直追，赶快愈多愈好地把中国学生请来吧。
    “为了扩张精神上的影响而化一些钱，即使只从物质意义上说，也能够比用别的方法收获得更多。商业追随精神上的支配，是比追随军旗更为可靠的。”这个很实际主义的大学校长向他的总统先生作了如此的结论。
    如此说来，为吸收中国学生即使化一些本钱也合算，那么“利用”中国人自己的钱来办这事当然是更合算了。斯密斯先生引用了詹姆士的聪敏主张后就提出了他的更聪敏的主张。但是他担心别人会责问，“庚子赔款”本是中国的钱，既然还给中国，为什么不是无条件地奉还呢？斯密斯先生的书中写道：“说起来自然是很轻松的，如果这笔钱是美国的，我们就该保持它；如果它是属于中国的，它就该还给中国。”但是斯密斯先生觉得解释这点并不困难，因为要中国付这笔钱，是用以“惩罚”中国人在一九○○年事件中对美国领事馆人员的“干犯”的，所以，斯密斯先生说：“我们的责任不是完全退还这笔钱，而是要把这笔钱用来使类似的事件将来难以再发生。”这话说得明白一点，就是要用这笔钱来消磨中国人民的反对帝国主义的思想，以达到如詹姆士校长所说的“在精神上支配”中国人。“我们不可以按照詹姆士校长的聪敏的建议去向中国政府提出，把这一笔钱，至少其中的一部分，用来教育在美国的中国学生么？”这位更聪敏的斯密斯先生如此说。
    根据以上所提出的一点简单的材料，至今还被艾奇逊引为中美“友谊”的证明的“退还庚款”这件事的真实意义可以弄清楚了。
    据说，对于美国资产阶级，一切事都可还元为钱，还元为会计帐上的借方与货方。“友谊”当然不是例外，“教育”也不是例外。照那位大学校长的预计，为吸引中国留学生而费的钱只要过三十年，就可以一本万利。到现在，时已四十年，似乎这已经成了笔倒帐了。——但是且慢，艾奇逊此刻向中国的“民主个人主义者”呼吁，岂不就是想从他们手中来连本带利地索回这笔帐么？他之在回溯中美友谊关系时特别提到“利用庚款供中国学生的教育费用”，大概还是因为这个原故吧？
