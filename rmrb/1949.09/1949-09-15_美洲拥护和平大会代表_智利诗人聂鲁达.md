　　Delegate to the American Continental Congress for Peace
  　Chilean Poet Pablo Neruda
    The American Continental Congress for Peace held in Mexico City is proceeding enthusiastically, a powerful blow to the aggressive policies of American imperialism. We often see the name of Pablo Neruda, the Chilean delegate to the conference, in the dispatches. He is an internationally renowned poet, but in the past his works were only popular in Spain, France and the Soviet Union. Even American readers are not very familiar with him. Chinese readers are even more unfamiliar. He is a revolutionary poet, the most outstanding poet in Latin America today. He fights against fascism and imperialism with politically combative poems and actions, and is enthusiastically supported by the international cultural community and peace-loving people. The poet's original name was Neftalí Ricardo Reyes. Neruda is his pen name. He was born in a small city in Chile, Parral, at the beginning of this century. His collection of poems "Residence on Earth" is famous throughout the Americas. He won the Chilean National Poetry Prize at the age of sixteen, wrote poetry while in university, and continued to create after entering the diplomatic service. The most important period of his life was when he was a diplomat stationed in Spain. He sympathized with the Spanish Republican government's resistance and helped the Spanish anti-fascist people. World War II promoted the greater development of Neruda's revolutionary thought. The heroic battle of Stalingrad inspired the poet's revolutionary enthusiasm. It was at this time that he officially became a Communist Party member and served as a member of the Chilean Congress. In the reactionary tide after World War II, Chile followed behind the United States, going against the tide and becoming increasingly reactionary. Progressive people were greatly persecuted, and Neruda was forced into exile.
    Last August, the World Congress of Cultural Workers in Defense of Peace was held in Wroclaw, Poland. Neruda and American revolutionary writer Howard Fast were both prevented from attending by their domestic reactionary governments. The famous painter Picasso requested the conference to protest to the Chilean government about Neruda's persecution. This April, a grander conference for the defense of peace was held in Paris, and this politician and poet gloriously served as one of the initiators of the conference.
    His collections of poems include "The Man with Chains," "Twenty Love Poems and a Song of Despair," "Man and His Hope," "Three Material Poems," and "To Stalingrad." Last year, while in exile, he wrote a long poem aimed at American imperialism, "Let the Woodcutter Wake Up," denouncing the warmongers of Wall Street and calling on the American people to defend peace and rise up to stop the heinous conspiracy of fascist ambitious to launch a new world war.
    Neruda's poems have been published in several translated versions with introductions by the famous French poet Aragon, and have also been translated and introduced by Ehrenburg in the Soviet Union, gaining the universal love and respect of the French and Soviet people. As early as 1927, he was sent to Yangon as a consul. During this period, he traveled to various parts of the Far East, such as India, Japan, Java, and Batavia, and also visited China once.

　　美洲拥护和平大会代表
  　智利诗人聂鲁达
    在墨西哥城举行的美洲拥护和平大会正在热烈进行中，这是对美帝侵略政策的有力的打击。我们在电讯中常看到出席大会的智利代表巴勃罗·聂鲁达的名字。他是一个国际闻名的诗人，可是过去他的著作只风行在西班牙、法国和苏联。即便是美国读者对他也不很熟悉。中国读者更是生疏。他是一个革命诗人，是今天拉丁美洲最杰出的诗人。他以富于政治战斗性的诗篇和行动来和法西斯主义和帝国主义斗争，受到国际文化界和爱好和平人民的热烈拥护。诗人原名纳甫塔列·里加度·莱斯。聂鲁达是他的笔名。本世纪初出生在智利的一个小城市巴拉尔。他的闻名全美洲的一本诗集是“地球上的居所”。他在十六岁的时候，就得到了智利的全国诗歌奖金，在大学时代写诗，进入外交界后，仍继续创作。他的生涯中最重要的时期是在做驻西班牙外交官的时候，他同情西班牙共和政府的抗战，并援助西班牙的反法西斯人民。第二次世界大战促使聂鲁达的革命思想获得更大的发展，斯大林格勒的英勇战斗鼓舞了诗人的革命热情，他就在这时正式成为一个共产党员，并任智利国会议员。在二次大战后的反动逆流中，智利跟随在美帝背后，倒行逆施，越来越反动，进步人士大遭迫害，聂鲁达也被迫流亡国外。
    去年八月世界文化工作者保卫和平大会在波兰窝茨亚威克开会，聂鲁达和美国革命作家法斯特均被他们国内的反动政府阻挠出席。名画家毕加索曾提请大会为聂鲁达受迫害事件向智利政府提出抗议。本年四月巴黎举行更盛大的保卫和平大会，这位政治家兼诗人光荣地担任了大会的发起人之一。
    他的诗集有“带链的人”、“二十首情诗和一支绝望的歌”、“人和他的希望”、“三篇物质的诗”、“致斯大林格勒”等。去年他在流亡中写了一首针对美国帝国主义的长诗“让那伐木者醒醒来”，痛斥华尔街的战争贩子，呼吁美国人民保卫和平，起来制止法西斯野心家们发动新的世界大战的罪恶阴谋。
    聂鲁达的诗在法国有名诗人阿拉贡作引言的几种译本出版，在苏联也曾由爱伦堡翻译介绍，得到法苏人民的普遍爱好与敬重。早在一九二七年的时候，他曾经被派到仰光去做领事。在这期间远东各地如印度、日本、爪哇、巴达维亚他都去游历过，并且还到过一次中国。
