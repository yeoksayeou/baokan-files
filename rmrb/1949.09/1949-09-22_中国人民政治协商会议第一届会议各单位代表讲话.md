The First Plenary Session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference has opened. From this day forward, China's history has entered a completely new era—the era of people's democracy. On behalf of all members of the Communist Party of China, I express my extreme joy and enthusiasm in celebrating the opening of the People's Political Consultative Conference and the imminent establishment of the People's Republic of China and its Central People's Government!

The Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference is the organizational form of the Chinese people's democratic united front and the most important concrete way for the people of the whole country to achieve revolutionary unity. Now that it has begun its work, it will continue to exist in China for a long time and establish its local organizations wherever necessary. In the past century, the Chinese people have deeply understood through their arduous struggle against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism that they must achieve revolutionary unity among all the people to defeat the powerful enemies oppressing them and, after defeating these enemies, consolidate the fruits of victory and successfully build a new China. However, due to the numerous obstacles and sabotage by imperialism and reactionaries, the Chinese people's revolutionary unity has not been able to finally take organizational shape or, if it has, has been destroyed by imperialism and reactionaries. However, today, because the heroic People's Liberation Army has basically overthrown the rule of imperialism and its running dog, the Kuomintang reactionaries, and because the awareness of the masses has increased, the revolutionary unity of the Chinese people has taken shape on a completely new basis. The opening of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference marks the final organizational formation of this new revolutionary unity of the whole people. The foundation of this unity is extremely solid, and its scale is extremely broad, unprecedented in history. Although imperialism and reactionaries are still trying every means to sabotage this unity, we believe that there is no force in the world that can obstruct or sabotage the revolutionary unity of the Chinese people. The 475 million Chinese people, once ridiculed as a heap of loose sand, have become a unified force under correct leadership, and their radiance will illuminate the world. They will quickly eliminate all remnants of the enemy, overcome all difficulties, and build a backward China into an independent, democratic, peaceful, unified, and prosperous new China.

From the moment of its birth, the Communist Party of China has struggled for the revolutionary unity of the Chinese people, and in the future, it will definitely continue to struggle for this unity. Therefore, the Communist Party of China will definitely make unremitting efforts for the success and development of the People's Political Consultative Conference. The Communist Party of China, as a political party, participates in the People's Political Consultative Conference with other democratic parties, people's organizations, ethnic minorities, overseas Chinese, and other patriotic democratic elements, and on the basis of the common program of New Democracy, sincerely cooperate to decide all important issues in China. All resolutions of the People's Political Consultative Conference that the Communist Party of China participates in and passes together, the Communist Party of China will resolutely execute and strive for their thorough implementation. The Communist Party of China will struggle for the highest prestige of the People's Political Consultative Conference and will not allow anyone to sabotage it. This is the attitude the Communist Party of China will adopt towards the People's Political Consultative Conference in the future. We also hope that all democratic parties, people's organizations, ethnic minorities, overseas Chinese, and other patriotic democratic elements, as well as all the people of the country, will adopt the same attitude towards the People's Political Consultative Conference that opens today.

The national revolutionary unity established today has a solid political foundation. This foundation is the common program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, which will be submitted to the plenary session for discussion and adoption by the Preparatory Committee of the Political Consultative Conference. We believe that this common program is an extremely important document in Chinese history. It outlines our general program, determines the state power structure and military system of our country, decides the economic policy, cultural and educational policy, ethnic policy, and foreign policy of our country. It is so firm and clear, clearly pointing out what should be done and must be done, and what should not be done and is not allowed to be done. This is a summary of the experience of the Chinese people's revolutionary struggle against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism in the past hundred years, especially in the past twenty years, and is a program for the people's revolutionary state-building. This is the great charter of the people for the current period. After the common program is discussed and adopted by the plenary session of the Political Consultative Conference, the Communist Party of China will fully abide by all its provisions and call on all the people of the country to strive for its thorough implementation. The national revolutionary unity and the Political Consultative Conference established on such a political foundation will be invincible in the world.

The Communist Party of China supports the People's Political Consultative Conference and struggles for the implementation of its common program because this common program includes the entire minimum program of the Communist Party. The current policy of the Communist Party is to fully implement its minimum program. Since this minimum program has been fully accepted by the People's Political Consultative Conference, it is only natural that the Communist Party supports the People's Political Consultative Conference and struggles for the implementation of its common program. However, everyone knows that in addition to its minimum program, the Communist Party also has its maximum program, which is not included in the common program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. During the consultations, some representatives proposed to include the socialist future of China in the common program, but we believe this is not appropriate. Because taking relatively serious socialist steps in China is a matter of the fairly distant future. If this goal is written in the common program, it is easy to confuse the practical steps we should take today. Undoubtedly, the future of China will head towards socialism and communism because the industrialization of China, if it does not lead China to socialism, will turn China into an imperialist country, which is unacceptable to the Chinese people and the people of the world. But this is a matter of the distant future. These matters can be discussed by the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in the future. When taking socialist steps in China, it must be based on the actual needs of China's social and economic development and the demands of the vast majority of the people. At that time, the Communist Party of China will definitely consult with all democratic parties, people's organizations, ethnic minorities, and other patriotic democratic figures and make joint decisions. The Communist Party of China is also willing to enter socialism together with all those who wish to enter socialism in the future. We know that not only is the realization of New Democracy today in need of the revolutionary unity of the whole people, but also the realization of socialism in the future will similarly require the revolutionary unity of the whole people.

Long live the revolutionary unity of the Chinese people!
Long live the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference!
Long live the People's Republic of China!
Long live the Central People's Government!

**Special Invited Representative**

**Song Qingling's Speech**

Today, China is a great force, and the Chinese people are advancing, advancing in the force of revolution. This is a historic leap, a great force of construction, the birth of a new China! We have reached this historic position due to the leadership of the Communist Party of China. This is the only party that possesses the power of the masses. The victory of Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People—nationalism, democracy, and livelihood—has thus been guaranteed.

The policy of "land to the tiller" implemented by the Communist Party in the countryside has proven this. Today's achievements prove the correctness of this policy. Now, the Communist Party is further proving its leadership in the cities. The burden of the first stage of the Chinese revolution was borne by the peasants. Now, the Communist Party has shifted the main force of the revolution from the peasants to the workers. Developing production is the key point of the current policy. We are giving concrete content to the framework of the industrialization plan for China drafted by Sun Yat-sen.

However, there are still those among us who doubt, believing that the people cannot achieve further progress, believing that what can be done in the countryside may not be done in the cities. They are watching and waiting to see what steps the Communist Party will take to awaken this sleeping giant, the industrial heart of all China, Shanghai, and restore its vitality. But let us look at this newly liberated Shanghai. The center of corruption and decay has been transformed into a pillar of production. The Military Control Commission of Shanghai has effectively solved the terrible problem of currency inflation that has plagued the people for twelve years. The Military Control Commission always considers the needs of the people. The method of real savings to guarantee the savings and living of the people, as well as other financial and economic measures, has made the newly issued currency gain the trust of the people.

This trust is also half due to the attitude of the Military Control Commission towards the people. The Military Control Commission clearly announces its policies and patiently explains every step of implementation with the simplest and clearest language so that everyone can understand. More importantly, they show a willingness to learn sincerely. They are not afraid of losing face and, if there are mistakes, they admit them frankly, hoping for advice from others to help the people help themselves. They say, "Teach us industrialists how to make the wheels of the machines turn to produce for the people?" They tell the workers and students, "What are your opinions on our suggestions?" They tell cultural and educational workers, "Liberate your thoughts that have been suppressed and oppressed. Tell us how to bring the greatest benefit to the people." The result, of course, is the support of the broad masses of the people, and the final harvest is success.

In politics, the Communist Party also uses similar methods to handle its relationship with the people. Today, representatives of various democratic parties, people's organizations, ethnic minorities, overseas Chinese, and democratic progressives are participating in this People's Political Consultative Conference. In Chinese history, this is the first time there has been such a broad representative gathering of the people, forming a true united front to execute the common program and organize a true people's democratic government.

Here, I would like to mention our cultural and educational workers. Their status in society has completely changed. Our teachers, artists, writers, musicians, and actors will no longer be persecuted and exploited. They have never had such a wide readership and audience in their lives. Knowledge is no longer a frightening thing. On the contrary, everyone is striving to make cultural and educational workers and the people more closely united, so that they can learn from the people and better serve the people.

This is the domestic situation. Then, on the international front, what is the significance of this march of the people's victory? The achievements of the Chinese people have changed the entire world situation. If the reactionary forces provoke a third world war, the only result will be their own annihilation. This force is indestructible and is many times greater than the military might of imperialism. This force is the core of future world security and is born of the unity of the world's peace-loving forces. The Chinese masses have already united with the governments and peoples of the world in the revolutionary struggle. This unity of the people's forces has changed the balance of history.

This is the great power of the workers, peasants, and intellectuals, the hundreds of millions of people of the world. Let us devote ourselves to the struggle to prevent the destruction of civilization, using every ounce of strength to ensure that everyone in the world can enjoy the necessities of life. That is, until every thatched hut is rebuilt into a proper dwelling, the products of the earth can flow freely, the profits of factories can be reasonably distributed, medical care and childcare in families are provided by society, our work will not stop. When everyone, regardless of race, skin color, beliefs, and place of residence, can equally obtain these necessities, we will have achieved our goal. This is a call for a new China and a new world. Comrades, let us start working now to build an independent, democratic, peaceful, and prosperous new China and unite with the people of the world to realize lasting world peace.

**Central Standing Committee Member of the Chinese Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee**

**He Xiangning's Speech**

Chairpersons and Representatives:

I, on behalf of the Chinese Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee, congratulate the opening of the First Plenary Session of the People's Political Consultative Conference and wish it success! I wish that after the Central People's Government is proclaimed and the common program is realized under its leadership, our politics will take a bright path, like the rising sun, shining brilliantly over the world. Today, under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong, all parties are united, and I celebrate this new People's Democratic Republic for thousands of years and wish everyone good health!

In his will, Sun Yat-sen said that he devoted forty years to the revolution, aiming to awaken the masses at home to achieve national freedom and equality, regulate capital, and implement "land to the tiller." Abroad, he aimed to unite with the nations of the world that treat us equally and struggle together. This was the purpose of Sun Yat-sen's revolution. Since the Xinhai Revolution, there have been many twists and turns, failures, bloodshed, and sacrifices. There has also been the most shameless traitor, Chiang Kai-shek, leading the reactionaries to betray the revolution, massacre the youth, and cause great damage to the Chinese revolution. However, Chiang Kai-shek has fallen, and the People's Political Consultative Conference has opened. The freedom and equality of China, the regulation of capital, "land to the tiller," and the unity with the nations of the world that treat us equally—all the purposes of the Chinese revolution—have been realized under the leadership of Chairman Mao. We can now comfort Sun Yat-sen in his grave! Therefore, the great significance of the People's Political Consultative Conference today is that Chairman Mao's leadership represents the entire revolutionary tradition of China over the past hundred years—from the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Revolution, the Xinhai Revolution, the War of Resistance Against Japan, to the People's Liberation War; from the revolutionary Three Principles of the People to New Democracy.

Since the People's Political Consultative Conference represents the revolutionary Three Principles of the People, and the victory of the Chinese people's revolution, the twenty years of Chairman Mao's unyielding struggle, hard work, and perseverance, all these prove that Chairman Mao's New Democracy is more appropriate and thorough than the revolutionary Three Principles of the People that we believe in. We believers in Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary Three Principles of the People should today become model New Democrats and model implementers of the common program of the People's Political Consultative Conference. We should wholeheartedly support the Central People's Government. The members and leaders of our various democratic parties should especially implement the laws and orders of the government, practice thrift, be cautious in action, seek truth from facts, and thus be worthy of the people of the country and the countless martyrs who have died.

When Sun Yat-sen was on his deathbed, he emphasized in his will to the Soviet Union the necessity of the two nations joining hands to resist the aggression of imperialism. In the past, we only had weak forces to awaken the masses to resist imperialism, and for a long time, the close cooperation between the Chinese and Soviet peoples was destroyed by the traitor Chiang Kai-shek. Now, the people's government has been established, and the People's Republic of China has been born. We should even more firmly execute the policy of eternal friendship with the Soviet Union and seek the international help of the Soviet Union and the New Democratic countries and the world's peace and democratic camp to build our new China. Recall the year 1923 after Lenin's death, when Sun Yat-sen wrote the characters "Friend and Teacher of the Nation." Now, our teacher is the Soviet Union. We should, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, realize Sun Yat-sen's will and forever join hands with the Soviet Union and the nations that treat us equally to struggle together.

Imperialism is not to be feared. Anglo-American imperialism is all bark and no bite. They are on the verge of collapse and will definitely die. We should not only have no illusions about these imperialists but also dare to fight against them.

As long as we can implement the common program, maintain and strengthen our unity, and jointly fight against imperialism, adhere to Sun Yat-sen's pro-Soviet policy and Chairman Mao's state-building principles, and struggle together under the leadership of Chairman Mao, then our country's future is limitless, and the future of our people is limitless happiness!

**Chairman of the China Democratic League**

**Zhang Lan's Speech**

Chairman Mao, Distinguished Representatives:

The First Plenary Session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference is officially opening today. This is the formal declaration by the Chinese people of the opening of the New Democratic era. This is the formal declaration by the Chinese people of the end of the era of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism in China. This is the formal declaration by the Chinese people to the world that from today on, the Chinese people have truly become masters of their own country.

China is the most populous country in the world. In such a country, the people have awakened, and the people have waged a war of liberation. Today, the People's Liberation War has achieved great victories, and the representatives of the Chinese people—representatives of the working class, the peasant class, the petty bourgeoisie, the national bourgeoisie, and other patriotic democrats—have gathered here to establish the people's own government through political consultation. This is not only a glorious event in Chinese history but also a date worthy of eternal remembrance in the history of mankind.

Today, standing on this podium, seeing this solemn and grand conference scene, I immediately have a thought. China's current New Democratic situation is the result of the wise leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao Zedong, the heroic fighting of the People's Liberation Army, and the struggle and sacrifice of all democratic parties and democratic elements of all classes in the country. We should first thank them. I personally wish to first express my respect to Chairman Mao Zedong of the Communist Party of China, to the Communist Party of China, and to the People's Liberation Army.

Regarding the opening of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference today, I believe that all the representatives present must have the same thought as mine, all believing that this conference has an absolute guarantee of success. The three months of preparatory work have prepared three perfect drafts. First, the Organizational Law of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference; second, the Organizational Law of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China; third, the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. These three drafts, after being passed by this conference, will become formal laws. Based on these laws, China's politics will have a new democratic centralized system. This new political system will be different from the existing systems of any country in the world. Our new system, of course, abandons the outdated things of the old democracy, such as the presidential system and the cabinet system, and is also different from the system of unified power and authority in the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries. Based on our democratic centralized system, the Chinese people hold the power in their own hands, and the people also have a highest authority that concentrates on exercising legislative and administrative powers. This is a system that is consistent with theory and practice. This system will definitely fully embody the spirit of New Democracy and definitely fully improve the administrative efficiency of China. With such a political system, the Chinese people will definitely be able to build our new state and new society.

Here, I want to praise the common program that will be passed. This is a great charter of the people of the new China. It determines the political theory and political system of the new China. It has the great policy of "revolution to the end" and the great principle of steady construction. Its content is rich; its language is plain. The new China should be proud of, should do, and can do, this program has all pointed out. What the new China should do, should do, but cannot do today in fact, this program will temporarily reserve. It has no high-sounding phrases, and it has even less empty talk. This is indeed a common program that is in line with reality and meets the needs of the people today.

I can imagine that such a common program will definitely be unanimously passed at this conference. Today, I wish to make a pact with all the representatives present, and we representatives should also make a pact with all the people of China, to make a great vow, to firmly decide that under the leadership of Chairman Mao, we will jointly shoulder the responsibility of implementing this program. We will make every clause, every word, and every character in the program a concrete reality.

Today, I also want to frankly say a few words. Revolution is difficult, and construction is also not easy. In a country that has undergone a long period of war, to engage in construction is even more difficult. Today, although the People's Liberation War has achieved great victories, it is still quite far from the goal of "revolution to the end." Today, everything in China has to start from scratch. Today, everything is in the initial stage. At the same time, we also know that China today still has domestic and foreign enemies. Feudal forces have a history of several thousand years in China. Imperialist aggression has a history of more than a hundred years in China. The exploitation of bureaucratic capitalism has a history of more than twenty years in China. These three evil forces are one and the same, and they are in cahoots. To thoroughly eliminate, sweep away, and destroy the remnants of these evil forces, it will still take a considerable amount of time. They are still having the dream of a cornered beast fighting back; they are still plotting to reignite the ashes. I believe that no one among the representatives present will overlook this fact. We should awaken all the people, jointly be vigilant, and jointly be on guard. Chairman Mao said in his opening speech at the Preparatory Meeting of the Political Consultative Conference that this is very true: "Whoever relaxes this vigilance will politically disarm themselves and become passive." All the people of the country should firmly remember these words in their hearts. "Revolution to the end," and the success of state-building is a great and arduous task. We must seize this once-in-a-thousand-years opportunity to build the country. We must, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, unite in sincerity and encourage each other to complete the historical mission of building a new China and a new society.

Today, standing in the position of a responsible person of the China Democratic League, I especially want to awaken all my fellow members to unite and support the future new government to complete the task of revolutionary state-building. The Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference is originally the united front of various democratic parties and democratic classes. The future new government is also a united government of various democratic parties and democratic classes. Unity and unity are true unity. With true unity, "revolution to the end" and the success of state-building will have true guarantees.

Distinguished Representatives! Today, the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference is officially opening! The great era of New Democracy in China is also opening today! New Democracy is the process of socialism, the right path to a classless society and a world of great harmony. Let us all strive! Today, we are masters of our own country! Our future is truly bright! Let us strive to build our new country! Let us strive to create a new society for mankind!

**Representative of the Liberated Areas**

**Gao Gang's Speech**

I speak on behalf of the liberated areas.

Now, the People's Liberation War in China has achieved basic victory, and all of China will soon be completely liberated. Looking back at the 22 years of the People's Liberation War and the development of the liberated areas, there have been three periods:

The first is the period from 1927 to 1937, the period of the land revolution. At that time, the Kuomintang reactionaries led by Chiang Kai-shek betrayed the revolution, sided with imperialism, and massacred the Chinese people. The Chinese people had no choice but to take up arms to resist the armed counter-revolution. After ten years of land revolution war, the liberated areas and the People's Liberation Army were established. Due to the rapid advance of Japanese aggression, the People's Liberation Army also experienced countless hardships and the famous Long March of 25,000 li, finally reaching the front line of the War of Resistance Against Japan.

The second is the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan. During the war, regardless of how the Kuomintang reactionaries led by Chiang Kai-shek colluded with Japanese imperialism and the traitor Wang Jingwei, using such despicable behaviors as cutting off supplies, armed blockade, and military attacks, they attempted to annihilate the People's Liberation Army and the liberated areas. But we finally smashed all the attacks of Japanese imperialism and the Chinese reactionaries, making the People's Liberation Army develop from a few thousand-strong force into a million-strong army, and the liberated areas with less than two million people (Shanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region and other guerrilla bases) develop into 19 liberated areas with nearly 100 million people at the time of Japan's surrender, and many liberated areas connected into one piece.

The third is this great People's Liberation War. This war was launched by the Kuomintang reactionaries under the instructions and support of American imperialism. The Kuomintang reactionaries tore up the January 1946 ceasefire agreement and the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, launching this unprecedented large-scale domestic war against the people. However, in a very short time, they were defeated by the heroic People's Liberation Army. The remaining Kuomintang reactionary remnants will soon be eliminated. This is a great victory for the Chinese people and also a victory for all the people of the world.

What is the reason for such a great victory?

Everyone knows: if there had been no leadership of the Communist Party of China, if there had been no People's Liberation Army, if there had been no people's democratic united front, our victory would have been impossible. Now, I especially want to talk about the peasants and land reform. This is a problem that cannot be separated from the leadership of the Communist Party of China (which is also the leadership of the proletariat), a problem that cannot be separated from the People's Liberation Army, and at the same time, a problem that cannot be separated from the people's united front. That is to say, leading the peasants to rise up is the basic key to our people's revolutionary victory.

The Chinese peasants make up 80% of the total population. We have suffered oppression for thousands of years, especially in modern times, for more than a hundred years, we have suffered oppression from imperialism and the domestic reactionary government. If we do not lead them to stand up, China's affairs cannot be done well, and the Chinese revolution has no hope. The working class party—the Communist Party of China—saw this, insisted on the policy of land reform, and therefore, the peasants were able to rise up consciously, feeling that the revolution was their own affair. They enthusiastically joined the army, fought bravely, and did not hesitate to provide food and undertake necessary combat work. Without the political liberation of the peasants and their gradual economic liberation, it would be impossible to win the peasants to actively participate in the liberation war; this is obvious.

The liberation war relies on the liberation of the peasants, and the establishment of a democratic system also relies on the liberation of the peasants. If the 80% of the population with political awareness do not participate in the management of the country, then it would be impossible for us to build a democratic system. If the Kuomintang henchmen and local tyrants continue to bully the peasants, then the so-called "democracy" would necessarily be completely fake.

Economic construction also relies on land reform for the peasants. Obviously, if the productivity of more than 80% to 90% of the population is not improved, then it would be impossible for us to truly develop industry and agriculture. Land reform is precisely a necessary way to improve the productivity of the broad masses of the people.

We have been fighting the liberation war for more than twenty years, and the process of repeated resistance with the enemy is very cruel. But we were finally able to overcome all difficulties, continuously defeat the powerful enemy, and make the liberated areas grow from small to large, from many small liberated areas develop into a large national area connected into one piece. This is not due to any magical secret, but because we have closely united with the broad masses of the people, especially carried out land reform in an orderly manner, and on this basis, built a democratic system and developed production, gaining the loyal support of the broad masses of peasants.

As for the working class, not only did they play a leading role in this great revolution, but also on the front line and the production front, they made extremely great contributions to the liberation war and overcoming difficulties. Of course, it is undoubted that the heroic struggle of the working class in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, the patriotic democratic movements of various democratic classes, democratic parties, and overseas Chinese have all powerfully supported the victory of the People's Liberation War.

It should be pointed out: the liberated areas, especially the old liberated areas in North China, East China, Northwest China, and the Northeast liberated area, have made great contributions to accumulating revolutionary strength, supporting the front line, training and cultivating cadres, educating and uniting the people of the whole country to defeat imperialism and its running dog, the Kuomintang reactionaries, which should be recorded in Chinese history in large characters.

Now, the Kuomintang reactionaries have been defeated, and the complete liberation of the country is about to come. The situation of being divided by the enemy has long been over, and the country will soon present an unprecedented unified situation in history. Of course, imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries will not be reconciled and will intensify their blockade, sabotage, and disruption activities. But as long as we continue to rely on the workers, rely on the peasants, and rely on the great unity of all democratic classes and nationalities in the country, continue to eliminate the remaining enemies in an orderly manner, complete the land reform of the whole country, restore and develop production and cultural and educational undertakings, then we will not only be able to break the blockade of imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries, smash the various disruptive actions of the enemy, but we will definitely be able to build the new China very well. There will be difficulties in construction, but the past and present facts all prove: the Chinese people are good at overcoming difficulties, and we believe we will definitely be able to overcome difficulties.

On behalf of the people of all the liberated areas, I congratulate the success of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference! I congratulate the birth of the People's Republic of China and the Central People's Government!

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 21st.

###  (六) People's Liberation Army Representative
###  Chen Yi's Speech

Comrades and Representatives,

The first plenary session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference is now officially convened. It stands at the peak of the Chinese people's democratic revolution, declaring the demise of the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries and the birth of the People's Republic of China. The Chinese people have finally risen up, and from now on, they will grasp their own destiny. With their labor and wisdom, they will build a new China of the people's democracy according to their own will. This marks the end of the old history and the beginning of a new one. The more than four million soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army, being able to send representatives to attend the People's Political Consultative Conference and witness this unprecedented people's revolutionary festival, consider it a great honor. Here, I, on behalf of all the soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army, express our unconditional support for the People's Political Consultative Conference. We are willing to, under the leadership of the conference, carry the people's revolutionary war to the end and ensure the smooth progress of the construction of New China. The People's Liberation Army is always ready to be dispatched by the Central People's Government to fight to the end to eliminate the remaining enemies and defend the independence and freedom of New China!

On behalf of the People's Liberation Army, I salute the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference with the highest revolutionary respect! And I wish the great construction work of the People's Political Consultative Conference a complete success!

###  (七) Standing Committee Member of the China Democratic National Construction Association
###  Huang Yanpei's Speech

Chairman and Comrades,

We are excited. This group of people, under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong of the Communist Party of China, will write a chapter of the greatest and most glorious significance in the history of the earth, which spans tens of millions of years. The title of this chapter is the opening of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.

We will build a new building in this Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, on the eastern half of the globe. This new building is already named the People's Republic of China. This new building is supported by many steel-reinforced concrete pillars. What are these pillars? The first is the Communist Party of China, and then the various democratic parties, people's organizations, regions, the People's Liberation Army, various ethnic minorities, overseas Chinese, and other patriots. These are the pillars, one by one. What is the steel-reinforced concrete? It is the united front of the people's democracy, consisting of the Chinese working class, peasant class, petty bourgeoisie, national bourgeoisie, and other patriots. What is the foundation of this new building? In terms of theoretical foundation, it is Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. At the top of this new building, there is a flag flying, and what is written on the flag? It is New Democracy. How big is this new building? It covers an area of 9,599,000 square kilometers. How many people live inside? There are 475 million people, including me. We will take the opportunity of the establishment of this building to immediately set up a central working organ, which is the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China.

This new building, before it was built, was often plagued by foreign robbers, namely imperialism. Inside, there were often thieves, namely the bureaucratic capitalists and feudal landlords. Among the pillars, there is one that is in the forefront. It is often attacked and persecuted by these foreign robbers and domestic thieves. What is this pillar? It is the national industrialists and businessmen. Now, this old pillar has become a new pillar. The national industrialists and businessmen are all shouting, "Yes! Yes!" They are all working together to build this new building. The thieves are almost completely eliminated. The robbers are not allowed in the door.

The environment of this new building is so beautiful and magnificent! There are very high mountains and very large bodies of water. Many mountains and many bodies of water all flow towards a very large ocean, the Pacific Ocean. The Pacific Ocean should be peaceful. However, a group of small pirates want to rely on the big pirates to stir up trouble, and the pirates themselves have started fighting. Only the people along the Pacific Ocean can wake up and guarantee the peace of the Pacific Ocean.

This new building has five gates, each with two large characters. Let me read them: Independence, Democracy, Peace, Unity, and Prosperity.

This new building has very magnificent and brilliant walls. On the walls, there are rows of very large characters, which are the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.

This new building has very good neighbors. The best and closest neighbor is a great building in the world, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. It is the only neighbor who has helped us the most in building this new building.

Looking back, to build this new building, countless people have exerted all their strength and shed their blood and sweat. Countless laboring masses and patriots have injured their limbs and sacrificed their most precious lives. It is in exchange for this new building.

This new building is completed. The owners of this new building, 475 million people, everyone should stand at their posts and work hard. We, the people of the whole nation, should thank the hundreds of thousands of soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army who have built this new building. We, the people of the whole nation, should thank Comrade Mao Zedong, the chairman of the Communist Party of China, who has led the construction of this new building, a great project unprecedented in history.

###  (八) Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions
###  Li Lisan's Speech

Chairman and Comrades,

Today, the first plenary session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference is officially convened. All workers in China and all laborers, both manual and intellectual, are celebrating this great, epoch-making day with unprecedented joy and excitement. They are celebrating the demise of the long-term oppression and enslavement of the Chinese people by imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. They are celebrating the birth of the People's Republic of China, the first truly people-ruled country in Chinese history. They are celebrating the fact that the people of the whole nation have finally freed themselves from the fate of being slaughtered, oppressed, starved, and impoverished under the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, and have laid a solid foundation for building an independent, democratic, peaceful, unified, and prosperous New China. This great victory is the fruit of the unyielding and heroic struggle of the Chinese working class and the people of the whole nation under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao for decades. When imperialism used its cannons to "break open" China's "maritime ban" and turn the Chinese people into semi-colonial slaves, over a hundred years ago, the Chinese people have fought many times against imperialism. However, all these revolutionary struggles ended in failure, either being directly suppressed by imperialism with the most barbaric methods of slaughter or being betrayed by traitors like Yuan Shikai and Chiang Kai-shek, who, to maintain their personal and reactionary feudal comprador class rule, willingly became imperialist running dogs. Only this time, the Chinese people's revolution has achieved a thorough victory. The main reason for this, as Chairman Mao said, is that we have "a disciplined party armed with Marxist-Leninist theory, adopting the method of self-criticism and linking with the masses," that is, the Communist Party of China as the leader, and "an army led by such a party," and "a united front of various revolutionary classes and factions led by such a party." We also have the assistance of the world's peace and democratic forces led by the socialist country of the Soviet Union. As Chairman Mao told us, without such assistance, the victory of the Chinese revolution is impossible, and even if it is achieved, it is impossible to consolidate it. I would like to add that the most fundamental reason for the victory of this Chinese people's revolution is that the Chinese working class and the people of the whole nation have found their wise leader. Because of this wise leader, the party leading the Chinese people's revolution, the Communist Party of China, has a precise guiding principle that combines Marxism-Leninism with Chinese practice, making the whole party united as one. Because of this wise leader, the vanguard of the Chinese people's revolution, the Chinese working class, and the people of the whole nation have a solid combination, forming a great unity of the people of the whole nation against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. This has ensured the inevitable victory of the Chinese people's revolution. This wise leader is Comrade Mao Zedong, whom the people of the whole nation unanimously love and respect.

The Chinese people's revolution has overthrown the rule of imperialism and its running dogs, the feudal comprador class, and established a people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance. This victory is indeed great and indeed worth celebrating; however, as Chairman Mao pointed out, "this is only the first step of the Long March," and there is still a longer journey and more arduous work ahead of us. This is not only to completely annihilate the remaining Kuomintang reactionary forces that are still struggling desperately and to carry the revolutionary war to the end, realizing the cause of unifying the whole of China; not only to abolish the privileges of imperialism in China, confiscate bureaucratic capital, and carry out land reform, thereby completely destroying the economic foundation of imperialism and the feudal comprador class's rule over China; but also to launch a long-term and great economic construction work, gradually turning the economically backward and impoverished agricultural country into an advanced and prosperous industrial country; turning a country with no national defense force, which has long suffered from imperialist invasion and oppression, into a truly independent and self-reliant country with a strong national defense force capable of resisting any imperialist aggression; turning a country where people's lives are often mired in poverty, hunger, and illiteracy into a country where all people can enjoy a life of plenty and cultural happiness; thus leading the Chinese people from New Democracy to the great goal of socialism and communism. This work is indeed great and arduous, and it requires the people of the whole nation, especially the working class, to continue to carry forward the revolutionary spirit of heroic struggle in the past, with the highest awareness of being the masters of the state, and to take on the heavy responsibility of building a new state and a new society. The working class is fundamentally different from any previous ruling class. Any previous ruling class, after seizing power, would use the blood and sweat of the broad laboring masses to enjoy themselves. The working class is the most oppressed and exploited class, and therefore not only has the most resolute and thorough revolutionary spirit, capable of leading the people of the whole nation to carry the revolution to the end, but also, after achieving revolutionary victory and becoming the leading class of the state power, will never use the method of exploiting other people to seek the interests of one class. On the contrary, only when all people are liberated will the working class be truly liberated; only when the lives of all people are improved will the lives of the working class be better improved. The improvement of the living conditions of the working class can only be sought in the development of the people's economy, the increase of production, and the increase of the wealth of the whole country. Therefore, the development of production and the prosperity of the economy are the highest interests of the people of the whole nation at present, and also the highest interests of the working class at present. The Chinese working class must follow the instructions of Chairman Mao, resolutely implement the policy of balancing public and private interests and benefiting both labor and capital, to achieve the goal of developing production and prospering the economy. We must respond to the call of Commander-in-Chief Zhu, with the spirit of "eating bitterness first and enjoying happiness later," and work hard to produce and become a model for the people of the whole nation. We must carry forward the traditional morality of loving the motherland, loving the people, loving labor, loving science, and cherishing public property, to change the social customs. We must strengthen our trade union organizations, making them the most reliable pillar of the new democratic regime; we must strengthen the united front organizations, to better unite the people of the whole nation, unanimously support all the measures of the people's government, and eliminate the sabotage plots of imperialism and all reactionaries. We must call on the people of the whole nation to further consolidate the friendly relations with China's most sincere friend, the Soviet Union. We must call on the people of the whole nation to learn from the Soviet people, learn from their great national construction experience and heroic spirit of hard struggle, to overcome all kinds of difficulties that will inevitably arise on our way forward. This is the responsibility that the Chinese working class, as the leading class of the state power, should undertake. This responsibility is indeed great and difficult. In the course of the Chinese people's struggle for thorough liberation, there will still be very arduous struggles ahead. However, we believe that with the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, the Chinese working class and the people of the whole nation can defeat any enemy and overcome any difficulty. The banner of Mao Zedong is the banner of the eternal victory of the Chinese people. The successful convening of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference is a sign that the people of the whole nation have been united under the banner of Mao Zedong. The great unity of the people of the whole nation under the banner of Mao Zedong is the guarantee that our great national construction cause will be successfully completed.

Long live the success of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference!

Long live the People's Republic of China!

Long live the eternal victory of the banner of Mao Zedong!

###  (九) Leader of the Xinjiang Delegation
###  Saifuddin's Speech

Comrades,

First of all, I, on behalf of the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang, congratulate the convening of this Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, which has great historical significance for China and the liberation movement of the people of the world; at the same time, I, on behalf of the people of Xinjiang, extend my sincere greetings to the people's representatives who have gathered here to realize this great historical task.

Comrades! At present, we are about to end the unfortunate history of the people of all ethnic groups in China and enter a new stage of striving for a bright new life for the people of the whole nation. This conference will determine the political line and organizational foundation of this struggle, so this conference is of great historical significance.

The new historical path of the Chinese people has been opened. We will transition from armed revolutionary struggle to political, economic, national defense, and cultural construction.

The victory of the People's Liberation Army, based on the worker-peasant alliance and led by the Communist Party of China, has opened this glorious path—the path of New Democracy. Therefore, all the people of China (including the people of Xinjiang) are grateful to the Communist Party of China and the People's Liberation Army, and at the same time, to the wise leader of this great victory, Comrade Mao Zedong and Comrade Zhu De. Not only that, but to repay this victory, in the future, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the Chinese People's Government, we will dedicate all our strength to the struggle of building a New China of New Democracy. We firmly believe that this is definitely achievable.

The victory of the People's Liberation Army has made our friends smile. Because this victory has solved the fundamental demands of the Chinese people and has added a powerful force to the world democratic anti-fascist front led by the Soviet Union, providing a great lesson and inspiration to the national liberation movements of colonial and small nations. Therefore, the Communist Party of China and the People's Liberation Army have won the sympathy and respect of the majority of the people in the world who love freedom.

At the same time, the victory of the People's Liberation Army has made our enemies cry. Because this victory has dealt a devastating blow to the reactionaries in China, especially the Kuomintang reactionaries, and has dealt an unyielding blow to the global aggressors, the imperialist reactionary clique. Therefore, the Kuomintang reactionaries and American and British imperialism, in order to save the collapse of the Kuomintang reactionary regime, have taken all possible measures, but the facts have proven that their attempts have not only been in vain but have also helped the People's Liberation Army. This is an inevitable result because the history of human society has long proven that any reactionary force that goes against the will of the majority of the people or against justice will ultimately perish.

Now let's talk about Xinjiang: We can say that the history of the people of Xinjiang is a history of cruel struggles against oppression, tyranny, and slavery to fight for freedom and democracy. Five years ago, the people's liberation movement that broke out in the Ili, Tacheng, and Altay regions, although it gave the people of Xinjiang some freedom, the Kuomintang reactionaries wanted to take away even this possibility and tried to re-impose dark tyranny to trample on the people. However, the people of the Xinjiang Autonomous Region continued to fight against the Kuomintang reactionaries in a peaceful environment.

In the past few years of struggle, the people of Xinjiang have come to understand that the liberation of the Chinese people (including the people of Xinjiang) can only be thoroughly solved after the victory of the People's Liberation Army. This means that the victory of the People's Liberation Army is also the victory of the people's liberation movement in Xinjiang. Therefore, the people of Xinjiang, in a peaceful struggle environment, have been eagerly awaiting the final victory of the People's Liberation Army. The people of Xinjiang, like the people in other parts of China, have firmly believed in and hoped for the New Democracy that will be implemented. They are happy to send representatives to participate in this People's Political Consultative Conference to solve the political and organizational problems of the whole country. This is a proud thing for the people of Xinjiang.

In summary: All the people of China are about to enter a new stage of the Chinese revolution. In front of us, there are tasks of creating new, free, progressive, cultural, and living conditions. This task is indeed arduous and heavy. However, the people of China (including the people of Xinjiang) firmly believe that we will definitely be able to complete this task. Because we have 28 years of struggle experience and the Communist Party of China, armed with Marxism-Leninism, and the wise leader of the people, Comrade Mao Zedong, to lead this struggle. This is our firm belief, and this is the source of our pride and courage.

Forward for the victory of New Democracy!

Long live the leader of the Chinese people, Comrade Mao Zedong!

###  (十) Special Invited Representative
###  Zhang Zhongjing's Speech

Today is the day of the opening of the first plenary session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the day of the people's victory in changing society and transforming history, and the day when the construction of New China and the creation of a new era begin. I am a member of the Kuomintang and a responsible cadre of the Kuomintang who, during the past 22 years of rule, has committed many sins against the country and the people. I am specially invited to participate in this grand meeting, feeling both shame and joy, with a heart full of conflicting emotions; now, when speaking, I really do not know how to express myself.

In this conference, there are more than 660 representatives participating. From the composition of the representatives, it includes all revolutionary classes in the country, various democratic parties, democratic personages, representatives of various circles, and various ethnic minorities, which truly reflects the democratic spirit of the conference and also symbolizes the unprecedented unity of the people of the whole nation. We know that this conference has been carefully and thoroughly prepared for several months and has been carefully and thoroughly discussed and consulted by all relevant parties. It will definitely achieve a complete success and complete the birth of the People's Republic of China. It will also break free from the shackles of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism and gradually, steadily, and healthily embark on the path of peaceful construction. This is undoubted.

However, the conference achieving a complete success and the smooth birth of New China does not mean that domestic and foreign reactionaries will then lower their flags and admit defeat. On the contrary, they will not be willing to admit defeat. For example, in the Guangzhou reactionary government, they are still stubborn and unrepentant, not only without any remorse but also becoming more and more brazen in their persecution of the broad masses of soldiers and people and their persecution of patriotic and progressive personages. Recently, they have even recruited so-called "international volunteers," trying to use Japanese fascist soldiers to massacre the Chinese people again! This is indeed a heinous crime of traitors and sellouts, whose crimes exceed those of Qin Hui, Wu Sangui, and Wang Jingwei by tens or hundreds of times! What was our eight-year war of resistance for? What were the sacrifices of millions of soldiers and people for? Their evil deeds will never be forgiven by the people of the whole nation, and they will one day face severe judgment and punishment from the people! We must issue a serious warning to these reactionaries who advocate the use of foreign troops to kill their own people! And we must warn all the officers and soldiers under the control of the reactionaries, and all the high-ranking generals: You should understand, for whom are you fighting? For whom are you dying? In front of you, the facts and the strong contrast between the two sides of revolution and counter-revolution, patriotism and treason, for the people and against the people, are as clear as iron. Have you not seen it clearly? You should not be deceived by the propaganda of a set of hackneyed phrases any longer. Now is your last chance to awaken and return to the people's ranks! We hope you will not miss this last chance and resolutely turn to the side of the people!

The U.S. State Department has issued a so-called white paper on Sino-American relations, and they still fantasize about using so-called "democratic individualists" as tools for American "anti-communism," which is truly dreaming with their eyes open! At the same time, the war-mongers in their Congress have been shouting "aid to China." In recent years, the U.S. government has actively supported Japan, reviving Japanese fascist militarism, what is their intention? Now they say things like "violent rule," "totalitarianism," "iron curtain," and "threatening the security of the Far East" to slander the revolutionary cause of the Chinese people! We must issue a serious warning to them: China is a country that loves peace and independence. It is precisely because it has suffered from imperialist aggression that it has become a semi-colonial country. Now we have awakened, should we remain in a state of perpetual subjugation without rebelling? Should we continue to be subjected to imperialist aggression without resisting? The revolutionary forces of the Chinese people are bound to grow stronger, and the revolutionary cause of the Chinese people is bound to succeed. Why do you still not let go and insist on using money and weapons to kill Chinese people, prolonging China's chaos, and deepening the suffering of the Chinese people? In your so-called "democratic country," is this the attitude that one country should have towards another? We must also warn the American government and the war-mongers: China, with its 475 million people, will definitely resolutely oppose you to the end!

Now the situation is very clear. Although there are still some difficulties and obstacles on the revolutionary road, they can definitely be overcome one by one, and the successful convening of this conference is the best guarantee for us to overcome difficulties and eliminate obstacles and complete the people's revolutionary cause. We, the people of the whole nation, are willing to sincerely accept the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, and together strive for the revolutionary work of anti-imperialism, anti-feudalism, and anti-bureaucratic capitalism, and together strive for the construction of New China, which is New Democracy, that is, the new Three Principles of the People! Strive for the complete victory and greatest success of the people's revolutionary cause!

###  (十一) Special Invited Representative
###  Peng Sheng's Speech

Today, the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference is convened, and I am honored to participate and attend. I am deeply pleased.

I have participated in the revolution for 45 years, following Dr. Sun Yat-sen to overthrow the Qing Dynasty. Unfortunately, the Beiyang warlords emerged, causing more than ten years of continuous warlord wars and oppression of the Chinese people. Finally, Dr. Sun Yat-sen witnessed the great victory of the Soviet revolution and realized that the Chinese revolution must learn from the Soviet Union. In 1924, he resolutely reorganized the Kuomintang and established the three great policies of "Alliance with the Soviet Union," "Alliance with the Communist Party," and "Supporting the Workers and Peasants." Therefore, the Kuomintang, both internally with the Chinese people and externally with the anti-imperialist Soviet Union, united and obtained the support of the broad masses of the people and international sympathy, thus being able to carry out the Northern Expedition. The Beiyang warlords were overthrown, but unfortunately, the power fell into the hands of Chiang Kai-shek and his reactionary clique, who continued to follow the old ways of the Beiyang warlords to oppress the people for their own selfish interests. This is the most regrettable thing for the Kuomintang. Later, due to the aggression of imperialism, the people of the whole nation united to resist Japan. We endured humiliation and were willing to cooperate with Chiang Kai-shek. Fortunately, with the great power of the people of the whole nation, we defeated Japanese imperialism. However, Chiang Kai-shek took credit for the people's victory, became arrogant and vicious, tore up the Political Consultative Conference resolution, launched a civil war, and is still stubbornly resisting to this day. Our revolution was not to change dynasties but to change society; it was to thoroughly overthrow the feudal autocracy that has lasted for thousands of years and to completely eliminate the oppression of imperialism that has lasted for nearly a hundred years. However, after decades of revolutionary struggle, we still could not avoid merely changing forms, and in the end, we even produced a dictatorial fascist Chiang Kai-shek and his four big families. Chiang Kai-shek's tyranny and violence are far worse than the Qing Dynasty and the Beiyang warlords, and there is evidence to prove this; Chiang Kai-shek abandoned the Japanese imperialists and colluded with the American imperialists; in addition to this, Chiang Kai-shek also cultivated a huge bureaucratic capitalist clique and created a fascist terrorist political regime, which is despised by all and shunned by the world. We, who participated in this so-called "revolution," feel extremely ashamed and indignant.

In this extremely reactionary, extremely cruel, and extremely chaotic situation, a great and powerful revolutionary force has been nurtured—it is the people's revolutionary force led by the Communist Party of China today, which is struggling against the most reactionary forces. Today, the power of the people has risen, and the remaining reactionary forces are about to be eliminated. Due to the rise of the people's power led by the Communist Party of China, there is today's convening of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. This is a true revolutionary change, and this is a revolutionary change unprecedented in Chinese history. Due to the great unity of the people led by the Communist Party of China, Chiang Kai-shek and his reactionary clique have been overthrown, the oppression of imperialism has been eliminated, the feudal remnants have been thoroughly cleaned up, and bureaucratic capitalism has been fundamentally eliminated. Now, through this Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, we will establish the People's Republic of China. This will definitely be an independent, democratic, peaceful, unified, and prosperous New China, which is worth our great joy. Such a great achievement, as Chairman Mao said, is produced from the principle of "extremes meet," governed by the law of historical development, but it is also indeed due to the correct leadership and hard struggle of the Communist Party of China, which is worthy of our great respect and gratitude. Today, the Communist Party of China leads the convening of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and places the great cause of building the country on everyone's shoulders. We should, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, unite the people of the whole nation and strive together to eliminate the remaining reactionary forces in the shortest possible time, implement the democratic dictatorship of the workers, peasants, petty bourgeoisie, and national bourgeoisie within the country, with the worker-peasant alliance as the foundation and the working class as the leader, and strive to develop production and benefit the people; externally, we should unite with the international revolutionary forces to promote lasting world peace. I, with all the representatives present, have a firm belief in the success of this conference.

###  (十二) Representative of Overseas Chinese in the Americas
###  Si Tu Mei Tang's Speech

Comrades and Representatives,

Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the people of the whole nation have basically overthrown the brutal fascist dictatorship of the Kuomintang reactionaries. Now we are all here to jointly deliberate on the establishment of the People's Democratic Republic, which is indeed the greatest joy in Chinese history. I, on behalf of the overseas Chinese in the Americas, return to the country to attend this conference, flying halfway around the world to Beijing, and with the warmest feelings, I congratulate the conference.

Overseas Chinese have always loved their motherland and contributed to the revolution, but they have never received the true care of their motherland, so they have long suffered from the humiliation and oppression of imperialism abroad and the exploitation and deception of corrupt officials at home. Therefore, they have long hoped for the appearance of an independent, free, democratic, and unified New China. Today, due to the heroic struggle of the People's Liberation Army and the people of the whole nation, this wish has been fulfilled, making us extremely excited!

Overseas Chinese are far away from their homeland, and the situation at home is not fully understood. Now that I have returned to liberated Beijing, I feel that the spirit of hard work, practicality, heroism, and self-sacrifice of the Communist Party of China members is truly admirable. Their excellent political style of repeatedly consulting and respecting the opinions of all parties in the construction of the country is truly worthy of our admiration. This is the greatest factor and guarantee for the Communist Party of China to have the qualifications to lead the people of the whole nation and achieve a thorough victory. We overseas Chinese believe that our new government is for the sake of the interests of the broad masses of the people, and we firmly express our support! At the same time, we believe that since we have been able to overthrow the three enemies, we will definitely be able to build our motherland well. For example, our industry is backward, and we should quickly engage in production and construction. Under the call of the new government to truly guarantee the legitimate rights and interests of overseas Chinese, overseas Chinese will definitely enthusiastically invest and return to their motherland. China has inexhaustible resources that have not yet been developed. We should assist the government in building our own motherland, which is our duty.

In the process of achieving complete victory and building New China, all kinds of big and small reactionaries, both open and covert, will definitely continue to use their tricks and plots to sow discord, blockade, and sabotage. Therefore, there will be difficulties, but we believe that any difficulty can be overcome. We must continue to unite and struggle, continue to carry forward this democratic spirit, and under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, continue to advance, consolidate this victory, and develop this victory!

I wish the conference a complete success.

专栏：

　　中国人民政治协商会议第一届会议各单位代表讲话
  　（一）中共中央政治局委员
    刘少奇讲话
    各位代表先生们！
    中国人民政治协商会议的第一届全体会议，业已开幕了。从此，中国的历史已经进入一个完全新的时代——人民民主时代。我代表中国共产党的全体党员以极端愉快和热烈的心情庆祝人民政治协商会议的开幕，庆祝即将由这个会议产生的中华人民共和国及其中央人民政府的成立！
    中国人民政治协商会议，是中国人民民主统一战线的组织形式，是全国人民实行革命大团结的一种最重要的具体方式。它在今天开始了自己的工作之后，将长期地继续在中国存在，并将在一切必要的地方建立它的地方组织。中国人民在一百多年来反对帝国主义，封建主义和官僚资本主义的艰苦斗争中深深地懂得：必须实行全国人民的革命大团结，才能战胜压在自己头上的强大的敌人，并在战胜这些敌人后巩固胜利的果实，成功地建设新中国。但在过去的时期，由于帝国主义和反动派的百端阻碍与破坏，中国人民的革命大团结没有能够在组织上最后地形成起来，或者初步地形成起来又被帝国主义和反动派所破坏。然而，在今天，由于英勇的人民解放军业已在基本上推翻了帝国主义及其走狗国民党反动派的统治以及人民群众觉悟程度的增高，中国人民的革命大团结得以在完全新的基础上形成起来，中国人民政治协商会议的开幕，就是表示这种新的全国人民的革命大团结及其在组织上的最后形成。这种团结的基础十分巩固，团结的规模十分广大，在历史上是空前未有的。帝国主义和反动派虽然仍在千方百计地企图破坏这种团结，但是，我们相信，世界上已经没有一种力量能够阻碍与破坏中国人民的这种革命大团结了。过去被人讥笑为一盘散沙的四万万七千五百万中国人民，一旦在正确的领导之下团结成为一个统一的力量，它的光芒将照耀全世界，它将迅速地肃清一切残敌，克服一切困难，把落后的中国建设成为独立、民主、和平、统一和富强的新中国。
    中国共产党从它产生的时候起，就为中国人民的革命大团结而奋斗，在今后，它也一定要继续为这种大团结而奋斗，因此，中国共产党一定要为人民政治协商会议的成功及其发展和巩固而进行不懈的努力。中国共产党以一个政党的资格参加人民政治协商会议，和其他各民主党派、各人民团体、各少数民族、国外华侨及其他爱国民主分子一起，在新民主主义的共同纲领的基础上忠诚合作，来决定中国一切重要的问题，凡是中国共产党参加并一道通过的人民政治协商会议的决议，中国共产党将坚决地执行并为其彻底实现而奋斗。中国共产党将为人民政治协商会议的最高威信而奋斗，不允许任何人来破坏人民政治协商会议。这就是中国共产党对人民政治协商会议今后所要采取的态度。我们也希望各民主党派、各人民团体、各少数民族、国外华侨及其他爱国民主分子以至全国人民对今天开幕的人民政治协商会议也采取同样的态度。
    在今天建立起来的全国人民的革命大团结，是有它的坚固的政治基础的。这个基础，就是即将由政协筹备会提交全体会议讨论和通过的中国人民政治协商会议的共同纲领。我们认为这个共同纲领是中国历史上一个极端重要的文献。它说到了我们的一般纲领，确定了我们国家的政权机构和军事制度，决定了我们国家的经济政策、文化教育政策、民族政策和外交政策。它是如此的坚定明确，清楚地指出了那些事是应该作而且必须作的，又那些事是不应该作而且不允许作的。这是总结了中国人民在最近一百多年来特别是最近二十多年来反对帝国主义，封建主义和官僚资本主义的革命斗争的经验，而制订出来的一部人民革命建国纲领。这是目前时期全国人民的大宪章。这个共同纲领，经过政协全体会议的讨论和通过之后，中国共产党当完全遵守它的一切规定，并号召全国人民为其彻底实现而奋斗。在这样的政治基础上建立起来的全国人民的大团结及政治协商会议，在世界上将是无敌的。
    中国共产党要拥护人民政治协商会议并为实现它的共同纲领而奋斗，是因为这个共同纲领包括了共产党的全部最低纲领，共产党的当前政策，就是要全部实现自己的最低纲领，这个最低纲领，既已全部为人民政治协商会议所接受，因此，中国共产党拥护人民政治协商会议并为实现它的共同纲领而奋斗，乃是当然的事情。但是，大家都知道，中国共产党除开自己的最低纲领之外，还有它的最高纲领，而这个最高纲领，则是中国人民政治协商会议的共同纲领所没有包括进去的。在协商过程中，有些代表提议把中国社会主义的前途写进共同纲领中去，但是我们认为这还是不妥当的。因为要在中国采取相当严重的社会主义的步骤，还是相当长久的将来的事情，如在共同纲领上写上这一个目标，很容易混淆我们在今天所要采取的实际步骤。无疑问，中国将来的前途，是要走到社会主义和共产主义去的，因为中国工业化的结果，如果不使中国走到社会主义去，就要使中国变为帝国主义的国家，这是中国人民以至全世界的人民都不能允许的。但这是很久以后的事情，对于这些事情，中国人民政治协商会议很可以在将来加以讨论。在中国采取社会主义的步骤，必须根据中国社会经济发展的实际需要和全国最大多数人民的要求，到了那种时候，中国共产党也一定要和各民主党派、各人民团体、各少数民族及其他爱国民主人士进行协商并共同地加以决定。中国共产党在将来也愿意和一切愿意进入社会主义的人们一道，共同地进入社会主义。我们知道，不独是今天实现新民主主义需要全国人民的革命大团结，就是到将来实现社会主义的时候，一样地需要全国人民的革命大团结。
    中国人民革命大团结万岁！
    中国人民政治协商会议万岁！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    中央人民政府万岁！
    （二）特邀代表
    宋庆龄讲话
    今天，中国是一个巨大的动力，中国的人民在前进，在革命的动力中前进。这是一个历史的跃进，一个建设的巨力，一个新中国的诞生！我们达到今天的历史地位，是由于中国共产党的领导。这是唯一拥有人民大众力量的政党。孙中山先生的民族、民权、民生三大主义的胜利实现，因此得到了最可靠的保证。
    中共在农村所实行的耕者有其田的政策，已经证明了这一点。我们今天的成就，证明了这一政策的正确性。现在中共正在进一步证明他们在城市中的领导力量。中国革命第一阶段的担子是由农民肩负起来的。现在中共已经把革命的主力从农民移向工人。发展生产是当前政策的基点。我们正在把孙中山先生所草拟的中国工业化的计划骨干，给与具体的内容。
    但是我们中间还有人在怀疑，他们认为人民不可能有进一步的成就了，他们认为在农村中所能做到的，未必能在城市中做到。他们在怀疑地观望，看看对于这个沉睡着的巨人，这个全中国工业心脏的上海，中共在采取什么步骤使它苏醒起来，恢复它的活力。可是让我们看看这新解放的上海吧。这是贪污腐化的中心，已经转变成生产的支柱。上海市军管会对于十二年来使人民受尽痛苦的可怕的通货膨胀问题，已经加以有效的解决。军管会时时刻刻照顾着人民的需要。为了保障人民的积蓄与生活而实行的折实储蓄的办法，以及其他财政经济上的措施，已经使新发行的货币，获得了人民的信任。
    这信任的取得，一半也是由于军管会对于人民的态度。军管会明白地宣布他们的政策，对于每一个执行的步骤，都加以耐心的说明，用了最简单明了的词句，使每个人都能了解。更重要的，他们表现愿意真诚地学习。他们决不怕失去面子，有了错误，就坦白承认，希望别人给与忠告，以求帮助人民自助。他们说：“请教你们工业家，怎样才能使机器的轮子转动，为人民生产？”他们对工人和学生说：“你们对于我们的建议，有什么意见？”他们对文化教育工作者说：“解放你们被闷塞压抑着的思想吧。请告诉我们，怎样才能使人民获得最大利益。”结果当然获得了广大人民的拥护，而最后的收获是成功。
    在政治方面，中共也采用同样方法，处理他们和人民的关系。今天参加着这个人民政治协商会议的，就包括各民主党派，人民团体，少数民族，国外华侨，以及民主进步人士的代表。在中国历史上，这是第一次有这样一个广大代表性的人民的集会，形成一个真正的统一战线，以执行共同纲领，和组织一个真正的人民民主政府。
    在这里我想提一下我们的文化教育工作者。他们在社会中的地位已经整个改变了。我们的教师，艺术家，作家，音乐家与戏剧家，不会再受迫害和剥削了。他们一生中从没有得到象现在这样广大的读者和听众。知识不再是可怕的东西了。相反的，大家正努力使文化教育工作者和人民更紧密地结合在一起，使他们能够向人民学习，因而能够更好的为人民服务。
    这是国内的情况。那么在国际阵线上，这人民胜利的进军又是什么意义呢？中国人民的成就，已经把整个世界的形势改变了。反动势力如果挑起第三次世界大战，唯一结果，就是他们本身的灭亡。这种力量是不能毁灭的，它比之帝国主义的庞大军事力量，要大过无数倍。这种力量是未来世界安全的核心，它是从世界和平力量的团结所产生的。中国人民大众在革命斗争中已经和世界各人民政府及人民力量完全结合在一起了。这种人民力量的结合，已经改变了历史的均衡。
    这是以工人，农民和知识分子为主体的世界亿万人民的伟大力量。让我们献身于阻止文明毁灭的斗争，用每一分力量，保证全世界每一个人都能得到生活上应有的享受。这是说，直到每一间茅舍重建成适当的住屋，大地上的产品能自由流通，工厂的利润获得合理的分配，家庭中的医药保育都由社会供给，我们的工作决不停止。当每个人不分种族，肤色，信仰与居住区域，都能同样获得这些必需品，我们才算达到了目的。这是新中国与新世界的一个号召。同志们，让我们现在就着手工作，建立一个独立、民主、和平与富强的新中国，和全世界的人民联合起来，实现世界的持久和平。
    （三）中国国民党革命委员会中央常务委员
    何香凝讲话
    各位主席团先生，各位代表先生：我谨代表中国国民党革命委员会庆贺第一届人民政治协商会议的开幕，并祝贺它的成功！我预祝在我们中央人民政府宣告成立，全国上下在它的领导下一致实现共同纲领之后，我们的政治将走上光明的道路，好象太阳初升似的光辉灿烂，照遍全世界。今天我们各党派在中共毛主席的领导下，团结一堂，我庆祝这新的人民民主共和国千秋万岁，并且恭祝各位健康！
    孙中山先生的遗嘱中曾说过他致力革命四十年，对内要唤起民众，为了实现国家的自由平等，节制资本与实行耕者有其田，对外联合世界上以平等待我之民族，共同奋斗，这是孙先生革命的目的。自辛亥革命以来这么多年，中间经过了很多曲折，失败，流血，牺牲，也经过了最无耻的卖国贼蒋介石为首的反动派叛变革命，屠杀青年，使中国革命受到很大损失，但是，蒋介石垮台了，人民政治协商会议开幕了。中国的自由平等，节制资本，耕者有其田，联合世界上以平等待我之民族，所有这些中国革命的目的，在毛主席的领导下得到了实现，我们可以告慰在九泉下的孙先生了！所以今天人民政协伟大意义，是由于毛主席的领导代表了中国近百年来整个革命的传统——从太平天国革命，辛亥革命，对日抗战，到人民解放战争；由革命的三民主义到新民主主义。
    人民政治协商会议既然代表了革命的三民主义，而且中国人民大革命的胜利，二十年来毛主席的坚强奋斗，克苦耐劳，凡此一切都证明毛主席的新民主主义是比我们所信仰的革命的三民主义来得妥善些，要来得彻底些。我们信仰孙中山先生的，革命的三民主义的信徒，今天，要来做一个模范的新民主主义工作者，就要做人民政治协商会议共同纲领的模范力行者。我们要全心全意地拥护中央人民政府，我们各民主党派的党员及负责人，尤其应该要实行政府的法令，政令，勤俭节约，临事而惧，实事求是，这才能对得住全国的人民，对得起无数死难的烈士。
    孙中山先生临终的时候，曾在致苏联的遗嘱里面强调中苏两民族亲密携手反抗帝国主义的侵略的必要。以前，我们只有微弱力量做唤起民众去反抗帝国主义的宣传工作，而且中间曾有很长时期，中苏两民族的亲密携手被无耻匪徒蒋介石所破坏。如今，人民的政府成立了，我们的中华人民共和国诞生了，我们更应执行中苏永远携手的方针，求取苏联和新民主主义国家以及全世界和平民主阵营的国际帮助，来建设我们的新中国。回忆民国十二年列宁逝世以后，孙先生曾写过“国友人师”四个字。现在，我们的人师就是苏联，我们就应在毛主席的领导下，实现孙先生的遗嘱，与苏联及平等待我之民族，永远携手，共同奋斗。
    帝国主义是不足畏惧的，英美帝国主义是色厉内荏的，他们是趋于垮台的，他们是一定要死亡的。我们不但不能对这些帝国主义有任何幻想，并且应该放胆去和它斗争。
    只要我们能实现共同纲领，保持和加强我们的团结，共同向帝国主义作斗争，遵守孙中山先生的亲苏政策与毛主席建国方针，在毛主席的领导下团结奋斗，那么，我们国家的前途是无限光明的，我们人民的前途是无限幸福的！
    （四）中国民主同盟主席
    张澜讲话
    毛主席，诸位代表先生：
    中国人民政治协商会议第一届全体会议今天正式宣告开幕。这是中国人民正式宣告中国新民主主义时代的开幕。这是中国人民正式宣告帝国主义，封建主义，官僚资本主义在中国的统治时代的结束。这是中国人民正式向全世界宣告，从今天起，中国人民真正做了自己的主人。
    中国是世界上人口最多的国家。在这样的一个国家里，人民觉悟了，人民进行了解放战争。到今天，人民解放战争获得了伟大的胜利，中国人民的代表，工人阶级，农人阶级，小资产阶级，民族资产阶级和其他爱国民主人士的代表，会聚一堂，用政治协商的方式，建立人民自己的政权，组织人民自己的政府。这不止是中国历史上一件光荣的大事，这是世界人类史上值得永久纪念的一个光荣的日期。
    今天我站在这个讲演台上，看到这个庄严伟大的会议局面，我立即发生了一个感想。中国今天这个新民主主义的局面，是中国共产党和毛泽东主席英明领导的结果，是中国人民解放军的英勇战斗，和全国各民主党派，各民主阶级的民主分子奋斗牺牲的结果。我们今天应首先感谢他们。我个人今天愿首先向中国共产党的毛主席，向中国共产党，向中国人民解放军表示敬意。
    对今天开幕的中国人民政治协商会议，我想在座诸位代表，一定和我的感想一样，都认为这个会议有了绝对成功的把握。三个月的筹备工作，已经准备好了三个完善的草案。第一，中国人民政治协商会议组织法；第二，中华人民共和国中央人民政府组织法；第三，中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领。这三个草案，经过这次会议的通过，就要成为正式的法案。根据这几个法案，中国政治将来就有了一个新民主主义的民主集中制。这个新的政治制度，将不同于世界上任何一个国家的现有制度。我们的新制度，当然放弃了旧民主主义中所谓的总统制，内阁制那一套陈腐的旧东西，同时我们亦不同于苏联及东欧各国的政权治权合一的制度。根据我们的民主集中制，中国人民把政权掌握在自己的手里，而人民又确确实实有了一个集中行使立法权和行政权的最高权力机关。这是理论与实际一致的一种制度。这个制度一定能够充分发挥新民主主义的精神，一定能够充分提高中国的行政效能。有了这样一个政治制度，中国人民一定能够建立我们的新国家和新社会。
    在这里，我要赞许那个将要通过的共同纲领。这是新中国的一个人民大宪章。他确定了新中国的政治理论和政治制度。他有了“革命到底”的大方针，他有了稳步建设的大原则。他的内容丰富；他的文字质朴。中国今天应傲的，要做的，和能够做的，这个纲领都一一标举出来了。中国将来应做的，要做的，但今日事实上还不能够做的，这个纲领就暂时保留不说。他没有高调，他更没有空想。这真是切合实际，切合人民今天需要的共同纲领。
    我可以想象得到，这样一个共同纲领在这次大会中必能得到全体一致的通过。我今天愿与在座诸位代表相约，我们全体代表更应与中国全体人民相约，我们应立下宏愿，抱定决心，在毛主席领导之下，共同起来担负实现这个纲领的责任。我们要把纲领中每一个条文，每一句话，每一个字，都使他成为具体实行的事实。
    今天我更愿坦白的说几句话。革命难，建设亦不易。在一个经过长期战争的国家，从事建设，更是难上加难。今天人民解放战争虽然有了伟大的胜利，但离“革命到底”的目的地还相当辽远。今天中国的建设，一切要从头做起。今天一切都在草创时期。同时，我们又知道，中国今天还有国内国外的敌人。封建势力在中国有了几千年的历史。帝国主义侵略在中国有了一百余年的历史。官僚资本主义的剥削在中国有了二十余年的历史。这三个恶势力是三位一体，是狼狈为奸。要彻底地肃清，扫荡，消灭这些恶势力的残余，还须要相当的时间。他们今天还在做困兽犹斗的迷梦；他们还在进行死灰复燃的阴谋。我相信在座诸位代表没有人会忽略这个事实。我们应唤起全体人民，共同警惕，共同戒备。毛主席在政协筹备会开幕词中说得十分真确，他说：“谁要放松了这项警惕，谁就在政治上解除武装，而使自己变成被动。”全国人民应把这几句话，牢牢记在心头。革命到底，建国成功，是个伟大而艰巨的工作。我们要把握住这个千载一时的建国机会。我们要在毛主席领导之下，精诚团结，共相勉励，以完成这个建设新中国新社会的历史使命。
    今天我站在中国民主同盟负责人的地位，我特别要唤起我全体盟员一致团结起来，拥护将来的新政府，以完成革命建国的任务。中国政治协商会议本来是各民主党派，各民主阶级的统一阵线。将来的新政府，又是一个各民主党派，各民主阶级的联合政府。统一联合，才是真正的团结。有了真正的团结，“革命到底”，建国成功，才有了真正的保证。
    诸位代表先生！我们的人民政治协商会今天正式开幕了。中国新民主主义的大时代今天亦开幕了！新民主主义是社会主义的过程，是走到无阶级社会，走到大同世界的正当途径。我们大家努力吧！我们今天是自己的主人了！我们的前途真是光明灿烂！我们努力来建设我们的新国家！我们努力来创造世界人类的新社会！
    （五）解放区代表
    高岗讲话
    我代表人民解放区讲几句话。
    现在中国人民解放战争已经获得基本的胜利，全中国将要完全解放，我们回顾二十二年来中国人民解放战争和人民解放区的发展，经过了三个时期：
    第一是一九二七——三七年的土地革命。那时，以蒋介石为首的国民党反动派叛变革命，投靠帝国主义，屠杀中国人民。中国人民不能不拿起武器，来反对武装的反革命。经过十年的土地革命战争，建立了人民解放区和人民解放军。由于日本侵略中国的急进，中国人民解放军又经历了千辛万苦和有名的二万五千里长征，终于达到抗日战争的前线。
    第二是八年抗日战争。在抗战中，不管以蒋介石为首的国民党反动派怎样同日本帝国主义及汉奸汪精卫等勾结，用断绝接济，武装封锁，军事进攻等无耻行为，企图消灭中国人民解放军和解放区。但我们终于粉碎了日本帝国主义和中国反动派的一切进攻，使人民解放军从几万人的队伍发展成百万大军，使不到二百万人口的解放区（陕甘宁解放区及其他游击根据地）发展到日本投降时拥有人口近一万万的十九个解放区，并使许多解放区连成一片。
    第三是这次伟大的人民解放战争。这一次战争是由国民党反动派在美帝国主义的指使和支援下发动的。国民党反动派撕毁了一九四六年一月的停战协定和政治协商会议的决议，发动了这一次空前大规模的反对人民的国内战争。可是在很短的时间内，即被英勇的人民解放军打败了。剩下的国民党反动派残余力量，不久将被肃清。这是中国人民的空前胜利，也是全世界人民的胜利。
    什么原因使我们得到这样伟大的胜利呢？
    大家都知道：如果没有中国共产党的领导，如果没有人民解放军，如果没有人民民主统一战线，我们的胜利是不可能的。现在我特别要讲的，就是关于农民，关于土地改革。这是和中国共产党的领导（也即无产阶级的领导）所不可分开的问题，是和人民解放军所不可分开的问题，同时也是和人民统一战线所不可分开的问题。就是说，领导农民翻身，是我们人民革命胜利的基本关键。
    中国农民占有全人口的百分之八十。我们受了几千年的压迫，特别近代一百多年来受帝国主义和国内反动政府的压迫，如果不领导他们站起来，中国事情就办不好，中国革命就没有希望。工人阶级的政党——中国共产党看到了这一点，坚持了土地改革的政策，因此，农民才会自觉起来，觉得革命是他们自己的事情，他们踊跃地参军，英勇地作战，不吝惜地支出粮食，担负必需的作战工作。没有农民在政治上并逐步地在经济上的解放，就不可能争得农民来积极参加解放战争；这是很显然的。
    解放战争需要依靠解放农民，建立民主制度也需要依靠解放农民。如果没有占人口百分之八十的有政治觉悟的农民群众参加管理国家，那末，我们要建设民主制度也是不可能的。如果国民党党棍、土豪恶霸继续在农民头上作威作福，那末，所谓“民主”就必然是完全假东西。
    经济建设也要依靠农民的土地改革。显然，如果没有提高占百分之八十到九十以上的人口的生产积极性，那末，我们要真正发展工业和农业，也是不可能的。土地改革正是提高广大人民生产积极性的必要办法。
    我们进行了二十几年的解放战争，和敌人的反复相持，这种过程是很残酷的。但我们终于能克服一切困难，不断地战胜了强大的敌人，使解放区从小变大，从许多小块的解放区发展为联成一片的全国性的大地区，这并没有什么神奇秘诀，而是由于我们紧紧地和广大人民在一起，特别是有步骤地进行了土地改革，并在这个基础上建设民主制度和发展生产，获得广大农民的忠诚拥护。
    至于工人阶级则不但在这种伟大革命中起了领导的作用，并且在前线上，在生产战线上对于解放战争和克服困难，都尽了极伟大的贡献。当然，无疑问的，在国民党统治区工人阶级的英勇斗争，各民主阶级、各民主党派、国外华侨的爱国民主运动，都是有力地配合了人民解放战争的胜利。
    应当指出：解放区，特别是华北、华东、西北等老解放区以及东北解放区，关于积蓄革命力量，支援前线，关于训练和培养干部，关于教育和团结全国人民，以战胜帝国主义及其走狗国民党反动派，给了伟大的贡献，将来应在中国历史上大书特书的。
    现在国民党反动派已被打败，全国完全解放就要到来，过去被敌人分割的局面早已结束，全国即将出现一个历史上空前统一的局面。当然，帝国主义和国民党反动派是不会甘心的，他们将加紧进行封锁，破坏捣乱等活动，但我们只要继续依靠工人，依靠农民，依靠全国各民主阶级和各民族的大团结，继续有步骤地消灭残余敌人，完成全国的土地改革，恢复和发展生产事业和文化教育事业，那末，我们就不仅能够打破帝国主义及国民党反动派的封锁，粉碎敌人的各种捣乱行为，而且一定能把新中国建设得很好。建设中不是没有困难，但过去和现在的事实都证明：中国人民是善于克服困难的，我们相信一定能够克服困难。
    谨此，代表全国解放区人民，庆祝中国人民政治协商会议的成功！庆祝中国人民共和国和中央人民政府的诞生！
    （六）人民解放军代表
    陈毅讲话
    各位代表先生们，代表同志们！
    中国人民政治协商会议第一次全体会议今天正式开幕，他站在中国人民民主革命胜利的高点；宣布国民党反动派统治的灭亡，宣布中华人民共和国的诞生。中国人民从此大翻身，从此自己掌握自己的命运。从此以自己的劳动与智慧，按照自己的意志，来建设一个人民民主的新中国。这是旧历史的结束和新历史的开端。中国人民解放军四百余万指战员，能派遣代表出席人民政协大会，躬逢空前的人民革命盛典，认为是无上光荣。在此我谨代表中国人民解放军全体指战员表示无条件拥护人民政协大会；愿在大会领导之下将人民革命战争进行到底，保证新中国建设的顺利进行。中国人民解放军随时准备着，听候中央人民政府的调用，为消灭残余敌人和保卫新中国的独立自由而奋斗到底！
    我代表中国人民解放军，向中国人民政协大会，致崇高的革命敬礼！并祝贺人民政协伟大建设工作的成功！
    （七）民主建国会常务理事
    黄炎培讲话
    主席团！诸位代表们！来宾们！工作同志们！
    我们兴奋了，我们这一群人，今天在中国共产党毛主席领导之下，要从地球几万万年一部大历史上边，写出一篇意义最伟大最光荣的记录，它的题目，就是中国人民政治协商会议开幕。
    我们要在这中国人民政治协商会议中间，在东半个地球大陆上边，建造起一所新的大厦来。这一所新的大厦，已题名了是中华人民共和国，这一所新的大厦，是钢骨水泥的许多柱子撑起来的。这些柱子是什么？第一是中国共产党，还有各民主党派，各人民团体，各地区，人民解放军，各少数民族，国外华侨，和其他爱国分子，就是这些单位的一根一根柱子，这钢骨水泥是什么？就是中国工人阶级，农民阶级，小资产阶级，民族资产阶级，和其他爱国分子的人民民主统一战线。这所新的大厦的基础，是什么？说理论基础罢，就是马克思列宁主义，毛泽东思想。这所新的大厦最高的顶尖上边，飘扬着一面大旗，大旗上写的是什么？是新民主主义。这所新的大厦多少大？有九百五十九万多方公里。中间住着多少人？有四万万七千五百多万人。连我在内。我们将乘着大厦成立的机会，立刻创设一个工作总机构，就是中华人民共和国中央人民政府。
    这所新的大厦，在没有建造起来的时候，这一群人常常闹着外来的大强盗，就是帝国主义。家里常常闹着一群小偷，就是官僚资本家和封建地主。中间有一根柱子，它也是当冲的。它给这般外来的大强盗和家里的小偷们破坏它，迫害它，这根柱子是什么？就是民族工商业者们。现在这老的柱子，变成新的柱子了。民族工商业者们嘴里都在邪许！邪许！共同地卖着气力来建造这所新的大厦了。小偷快完全消灭了。大强盗不许进门了。
    这所新的大厦的环境，多么美丽！多么伟大！有很高的高山，很大的大水，很多条高山，很多条大水，统统趋向着一个很大的大洋，就是太平洋。太平洋应该是太平的。可是一群小的海盗，想倚靠着大的海盗，来兴风作浪，并且强盗们自己先闹起来了。只有沿太平洋的各国人民自己觉悟起来，才能保障太平洋的太平。
    这所新的大厦，有五个大门，每个门上两个大字，让我读起来：独立，民主，和平，统一，富强。
    这所新的大厦，周围有很辉煌灿烂的墙壁，墙壁上写着一行一行顶大的大字，就是中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领。
    这所新的大厦，有很好的邻居，最好最接近的邻居，是一所世界上最伟大的大厦，就是苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟。它是惟一的帮助我们建造这所新的大厦最出力的一个邻居。
    回过头来想，为了建造这所新的大厦，不知多多少少人卖尽了他们的气力，流尽了他们的血汗，多多少少劳苦大众，爱国志士，伤残了他们的肢体，牺牲了他们再宝贵没有的生命，就是换得来这所新的大厦。
    这所新的大厦完成了。这所新的大厦的主人，四万万七千五百万人民，大家要站立在各个岗位上，去好好地工作了。我们全国人民要谢谢建造这所新的大厦的几百万人民解放军战斗员，指挥员，他们的总司令朱德先生。我们全国人民要谢谢领导建造这所新的大厦的空前伟大工程的中国共产党主席毛泽东先生。
    （八）中华全国总工会副主席
    李立三讲话主席、诸位代表：
    今天，中国人民政治协商会议第一届全体会议正式开幕的日子，全中国工人和一切体力脑力劳动者，都以空前未有的欢欣鼓舞来庆祝这个伟大的划时代的日子，庆祝那个长期压榨和奴役中国人民的帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义统治的死灭，庆祝中国历史上第一次真正由人民统治的中华人民共和国的诞生。庆祝全国人民最终地摆脱了在国民党反动统治下遭受屠杀、压迫、饥饿、贫困的奴隶命运，而奠定了建设一个独立、民主、和平、统一和富强的新中国的巩固基础。这个伟大胜利的获得，是中国工人阶级和全国人民在中国共产党和毛主席领导下进行了几十年不挠不屈的英勇斗争所创造的果实。在帝国主义用它的大炮“冲击”开中国的“海禁”，把中国人民变成半殖民地的奴隶，一百多年来，中国人民进行过多次的反帝国主义的革命斗争，结果都遭受了失败，不是被帝国主义用最野蛮的屠杀方法直接镇压下去了，就是被民族叛徒如袁世凯、蒋介石之流为保持个人的和反动封建买办阶级的统治，甘作帝国主义走狗所出卖了。只有这一次中国人民的大革命才获得了彻底的胜利。这里最主要的原因正是如毛主席所说的，由于我们有“一个有纪律的有马恩列斯理论武装的采取自我批评方法的联系人民群众的党”，即中国共产党为领导，由于有“一个由这样的党领导的军队”，有“一个由这样党领导下的各革命阶层各革命派别的统一战线”，由于有以社会主义国家苏联为首的世界和平民主力量的援助。正如毛主席告诉我们的，没有这样的援助，中国革命的胜利是不可能的，胜利了，要巩固也是不可能的。我还想补充一句，这一次中国人民大革命获得胜利的最基本的原因，是由于中国工人阶级和全国人民找到了自己的英明的领袖。由于有这个英明的领袖，才使领导中国人民革命的党——中国共产党，有了马列主义与中国实践结合的准确指针而使全党团结得象一个人一样。由于有这个英明的领袖，才使中国人民革命的先进部队，中国工人阶级与全国人民有了巩固的结合，而形成了全国人民反帝国主义反封建主义反官僚资本主义的大团结，这就造成了中国人民革命必然胜利的保证。这个英明的领袖，就是现在全国人民一致爱戴的毛主席。
    中国人民革命推翻了帝国主义及其走狗封建买办阶级的统治，建立了由工人阶级领导的，以工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政的国家，这个胜利的确是伟大的，的确是值得庆祝的；但是正如毛主席所指示的，“这只是万里长征走完了第一步”，还有更远的路程，更伟大更艰苦的工作摆在我们的前面，这就是不仅要彻底歼灭现在还在作垂死挣扎的国民党反动势力的残余，把革命战争进行到底，实现统一全中国的事业；不仅要取消帝国主义在中国的特权，没收官僚资本，实行土地改革，以彻底摧毁帝国主义和封建买办阶级统治中国的经济基础；而且要开展一个长期的伟大的经济建设工作，逐渐把经济落后的，贫困的农业国变成一个先进的富强的工业国；把毫无国防力量，长期遭受帝国主义侵略压迫的半殖民地国家，变成一个有强大的国防力量足以抵御任何帝国主义侵犯的真正独立自主的国家；把人民生活经常陷在贫穷，饥饿，和不文化的痛苦当中的国家，变成全体人民都能享受丰衣足食和文化幸福生活的国家；这样来引导中国人民从新民主主义走向社会主义和共产主义的伟大目的。这个工作的确是伟大而艰苦的，这需要全国人民首先是我们工人阶级以国家主人翁的最高觉悟，继续发扬过去英勇斗争的革命精神，负起这个建设新国家，新社会的艰巨责任。工人阶级与过去任何一个统治阶级有根本的区别。过去任何一个统治阶级在取得政权以后，都是以剥削广大劳动群众的血汗来自己享福。工人阶级是最受压迫最受剥削的阶级，因而不只是具有最坚决最彻底的革命精神，能领导全国人民把革命进行到底，而且在取得了革命胜利，成了领导国家政权的阶级以后，决不能以剥削其他人民群众的方法来谋自己一个阶级的利益。恰恰相反，只有全体人民都得到了解放，工人阶级才能得到真正的解放；只有全体人民的生活都改善了，工人阶级的生活才能得到更好的改善。工人阶级生活的改善，只有在发展人民经济，提高生产，增加整个国家财富当中才能求得。因此发展生产，繁荣经济是全国人民当前的最高利益，也就是工人阶级当前的最高利益。中国工人阶级必须遵照毛主席的指示，坚决执行公私兼顾劳资两利的政策，以达到发展生产繁荣经济的目的。必（⑵⑶）须响应朱总司令的号召，以吃苦在先，享乐在后的精神，努力生产来成为全国人民的模范。必须发扬爱祖国，爱人民，爱劳动，爱科学和爱护公共财产的固有道德，以改变社会的风气。必须努力巩固自己的工会组织，使它成为新民主主义政权最可靠的支柱；必须努力巩固统一战线的组织，以便更加团结全体人民，一致拥护人民政府的一切设施，而消灭帝国主义和一切反动份子的破坏阴谋。必须号召全国人民更加巩固与中国人民的最真实的朋友——苏联的友好关系。号召全国人民向苏联人民学习，学习他们的伟大的建国经验，和艰苦奋斗的英勇精神，以克服在我们前进道路上不可避免地将要发生的各种困难。这就是中国工人阶级成为国家政权领导阶级所应当负起的责任。这个责任的确是伟大而困难的。在中国人民争取澈底解放继续前进的道路上还会有很艰苦的斗争。但是我们相信，有了中国共产党和毛主席的领导，中国工人阶级和全国人民是可以战胜任何敌人，克服任何困难的。毛泽东的旗帜就是中国人民永远胜利的旗帜。中国人民政治协商会议的胜利召开，便是表明全国人民在毛泽东旗帜下巩固的团结起来了。全国人民在毛泽东旗帜下的大团结，便是我们今后伟大建国事业必能胜利完成的保证。
    中国人民政治协商会议成功万岁！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    毛泽东旗帜的永远胜利万岁！
    （九）新疆代表团团长
    赛福鼎讲话诸位代表同志：
    首先我代表新疆各族人民庆贺这一个对中国，对全世界人民解放运动具有重大历史意义的中国人民政治协商会议的召开；同时我要代表新疆人民为实现这一伟大的历史任务而聚集在这个会场的人民代表们致最诚恳的慰问。
    同志们！目前，我们已经快要结束中国境内各族人民的不幸的历史而迈进争取全国人民的光明的新生活的神圣任务的新阶段。在这个会议上，将确定这个斗争的政治路线和组织基础，所以说这个会议是具有巨大的历史意义的。
    我们中国人民的新的历史途径，已经打开。我们将由武装革命斗争，转入到政治的经济的国防的和文化的建设方面。
    在以工农联盟为基础上建立的，而由中国共产党领导的中国人民解放军的胜利，给我们打开了这条光荣的道路——新民主主义的道路。因此全中国人民（新疆人民也在内）对中国共产党和人民解放军，同时向领导这伟大的胜利的英明的领袖毛泽东同志和朱德同志表示极诚恳的感激和崇高的谢意。不但是这样，而且为了报答这个胜利，今后要在中共和中国人民政府的领导下，在建设新民主主义的新中国的斗争中，供献出我们所有的力量。我们坚决相信这也是一定能够作得到的。
    中国人民解放军的胜利，使我们的友人欢笑。因为这个胜利已解决了中国人民的根本要求，同时给以苏联为首的世界爱好和平的民主阵线，增加了一个很强大的力量，给世界殖民地弱小民族的民族和人民解放运动，以很大的教训和启发的作用，所以中国共产党和中国人民解放军已取得了全世界爱好自由的大多数人民的同情和尊敬。
    同时中国人民解放军的胜利也使我们的敌人痛哭，因为这个胜利给中国境内的反动分子们特别是给国民党反动派以毁灭性的打击，给全世界侵略者，帝国主义反动集团以无情的打击，所以国民党反动派和美、英帝国主义，为了挽救国民党反动政权的崩溃，采取过所有可能的措施，但是事实已证明，他们的一切企图不仅空费气力，反而帮助人民解放军。这是必然的结果，因为人类社会的历史早已证实，凡违反多数人民的意志或者违背正义的任何反动势力，终究是要归于灭亡的。
    现在让我们谈一谈新疆：我们可以说新疆人民的历史就是一部反压迫、反专制、反奴役、以争取自由和民主的残酷斗争历史。五年前在伊犁、塔城、阿山三区暴发的人民解放运动，虽然使我们新疆人民获得部分自由权利，但国民党反动派统治，连这一点可能性都要剥夺去，而企图重新实行黑暗专制，来践踏人民。可是新疆的民族自治区的人民却在和平环境里，继续进行了他们反对国民党反动派的斗争。
    新疆人民在最近几年的斗争经验中，已经了解中国人民（新疆人民也在内）的解放，只有在中国人民解放军的胜利后，才能获得彻底解决。这也就是说中国人民解放军的胜利也就是新疆人民解放运动的胜利。所以新疆人民在和平斗争的环境中，很关切的期待着中国人民解放军的最后胜利的来临，新疆人民和中国境内其他人民，同样的坚定了他们对将要实行的新民主主义的信心和希望。而高兴地派出代表前来参加解决整个国家的政治和组织等问题的这一个人民政治协商会议。这是新疆人民值得骄傲的一件事情。
    总而言之：我们全中国人民，即将要踏上中国革命的新阶段，在我们面前正摆着创造新的、自由的、进步的、文化的、生活的任务。这个任务当然是很艰巨而繁重的。但是中国人民（新疆人民也在内）坚决相信，一定能够胜利完成这个任务，因为我们已有二十八年斗争经验、而以马克思，列宁主义武装起来的中国共产党和英明的人民领袖毛泽东同志来领导这个斗争，这就是我们的坚强信念，这也就是使我们骄傲和勇敢的原动力。
    为新民主主义胜利而前进！
    中国人民领袖毛泽东同志万岁！

    张治中讲话
    今天是中国人民政治协商会议第一届全体会议开幕的日子，就是改革社会转变历史的人民胜利的日子，也是建设新中国创造新时代从此开始的日子。我是一个国民党党员，并且是国民党负责干部中在过去二十二年的执政时期对国家对人民负了多少罪过的一分子，来被特别邀请参加这一盛会，真是惭愧与欣幸交萦，内心充满了矛盾情绪；此时说话，真不知怎样说法才是。
    在这次会议中，参加代表六百六十多人。从代表的构成分子来看，包括了全国各革命阶级，各民主党派，各民主人士，各界代表，各少数民族，实在充分表现会议的民主精神，同时也象征着全国人民的空前团结。我们知道，这次会议经过几个月来慎重的周到的筹备，又经过各关系方面慎重的周到的研究磋商，一定可以获得圆满的结果，完成中华人民共和国的诞生，并且摆脱帝国主义，封建主义和官僚资本主义的束缚，逐步地、稳健地走上和平建设的大道，这是毫无疑问的。
    但是，会议获得圆满结果，新中国顺利诞生，这并不等于说国内外反动派就从此掩旗息鼓，承认失败，相反地，他们绝不甘心于失败的。比方在广州反动政府方面，他们现在还是执迷不悟，不特没有丝毫悔罪之心，而且显得更变本加厉地从事对广大军民的摧残，对爱国进步人士的迫害。最近更征募所谓“国际志愿军”，企图利用日本法西斯军人，再来屠杀中国人民！这实在是一种罪大恶极的汉奸卖国贼行为，其罪状超过秦桧、吴三桂、汪精卫何止十百倍！我们八年浴血抗战为的什么？我们千百万军民牺牲为的什么？他们的罪恶行为是绝对得不到全国人民的宽恕的，而且会有一天在人民面前受到严厉的审判惩治的！我们要向这班主张借外兵杀国人的反动分子提出严重的警告！并正告现在反动控制下的全体官兵，各高级将领们：你们应该明白，你们现在为何而战？为谁而死？眼前革命与反革命，爱国与祸国，为人民与反人民两方面所显示的铁一般的事实和强烈的对照，你们还没有看清楚吗？你们不应该再被一派陈腔滥调的欺骗的宣传所蒙蔽，现在已经是你们觉悟来归的最后机会了！希望你们不要错过这最后的机会，毅然决然地走向人民队伍方面来！
    在美国国务院发表了所谓中美关系的白皮书，他们还幻想利用什么“民主个人主义者”来做美帝“反共”的工具，真是睁着眼睛做梦！同时它国会里的好战之徒，一直在叫嚣“援华”。这几年来美国政府积极地扶植日本，复活法西斯日本军国主义，究竟存心何在？现在又说什么“暴力统治”，“极权主义”，“铁幕”，“威胁远东安全”等诳语来诬蔑中国人民的革命事业！我们要向他们提出严重的警告：中国本是爱好和平独立的国家，正因为受了帝国主义的侵略，才变为半殖民地的国家，现在我们觉醒过来了，难道我们应该长久地沉沦下去而不翻身吗？难道我们应该继续被帝国主义的侵略而不反抗吗？中国人民的革命力量是必然壮大的，中国人民的革命事业是必然成功的，你们为什么还不肯放手，仍然要想拿金钱和武器来残杀中国人，来延长中国的祸乱，来加深中国人民的灾难！？难道在你们号称所谓“民主国度”的逻辑里，这是一个国家对别一个国家应有的态度吗？我们更要正告美国和各国人士，中国人民为了本身的自由独立，我们要“团结国内国际的一切力量，击破内外反动派，我们就有生意可做了，我们就有可能在平等互利和互相尊重领土主权的基础上和一切国家建立外交关系了。”这是中共毛主席所倡导的外交政策，是完全正确的，是全国人民所一致拥护的。我们很惭愧，中国由于遭受了帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的压迫剥削，一切显得特别落后，所以我们特别需要和平，特别需要建设，而且需要长期的和平，长期的建设。中国需要和平，世界也需要和平，我们中国有这个信心，有这个力量，有这个资格和抱负来保障中国的和平，促进世界的和平。美国政府和好战的人们！你们这样干涉中国内政，是不惜与中国四万万七千万的人民为敌，全中国人民一定要坚决反对到底的！
    现在局势已经非常明显了，革命前途虽然还有若干的困难障碍，但是一定可以逐一克服排除的，而这次会议的顺利成功，正是我们克服困难排除障碍完成人民革命事业的最好的保证。我们全国人民都愿诚心诚意地接受中国共产党和毛主席的领导，共同为反帝反封建反官僚资本的革命工作而奋斗，共同为新民主主义，亦即革命的三民主义的新中国建设而奋斗！争取人民革命事业的完全胜利最大成功！

    程潜讲话
    今日人民政治协商会议开幕，本人参加出席，引为非常荣幸，衷心愉快。
    本人参加革命四十五年，追随中山先生把满清推翻，不幸随即出现了北洋军阀，造成十余年连续不断军阀混战与镇压中国人民的局势。最后中山先生目击苏联革命伟大的胜利，深知中国革命必须效法苏联，于民国十三年坚决改组国民党，确立革命的三大政策——“联苏”、“联共”、“农工”——因此，国民党内与中国人民，外与反侵略的苏联相结合，得到广大人民的拥护及国际的同情，始能进行北伐战争。北洋军阀倒了，那知政权竟又落到蒋介石及其反动集团的手里，仍蹈袭北洋军阀压迫人民之故智以自私自利，这是国民党最可痛心的一桩事。厥后为了帝国主义的侵略，全国人民团结抗日，我们忍气吞声不惜和蒋介石合作，幸赖全国人民的伟大力量，把日本帝国主义打倒，那知蒋介石贪人民之功以为己有，便趾高气扬，穷凶极恶，撕毁政协决议，发动内战，直到今日，还在负隅顽抗。我们革命，目的本来不在转换朝代，而是要求社会变质；是要把数千年来的封建专制彻底推翻，把近百年的帝国主义压迫扫除净尽，但是数十年来努力革命，仍旧免不了仅仅变换形式，尤其是革到最后，居然革出一个独裁的法西斯的蒋介石及其四大家族来。蒋介石的专制横暴，比之满清，比之北洋军阀，甚过万倍，皆有事实证明；蒋介石丢开了日本帝国主义者，又勾结了美帝国主义者；除此而外，蒋介石更增添了培育了一个庞大无比的官僚资本集团，更造成法西斯的特务恐怖政治，真是兆人所指，道路侧目。我们参加这种所谓“革命”的人，感到非常惭愧，也非常愤慨。
    在这极度反动，极度残虐，极度紊乱当中，便孕育了伟大的坚强的革命力量——便是今日中国共产党所领导的人民革命力量，以与最反革命的力量艰苦斗争。到今日，人民的力量站起来了，反动残余快要消灭了。由于中国共产党所领导的人民力量的抬头，才有今日的人民政治协商会议的召集。这才是一个真正变质的革命，这才是划时代的中国有史以来所未有的一次人民真正大团结。由于中国共产党领导的人民大团结，才把蒋介石及其反动集团打倒下去，才把帝国主义者的压迫扫除出去，才能彻底肃清封建残余，才能根本铲除官僚资本主义。现在，我们经过这次人民政治协商会议，便要成立中华人民共和国。这必然是一个独立、民主、和平、统一和富强的新中国，值得我们十分庆幸。这样伟大的成果，诚如毛主席所说，是从“物极必反”的道理产生的，受着历史发展规律的支配，但也确实由于中国共产党的正确领导和艰苦奋斗，值得我们十分钦敬，十分感激。今日中国共产党领导召集人民政治协商会议，把建国大业搁在大家肩上，我们今后便应该在中国共产党领导之下，全国人民一致团结，一致努力，在最短期内把反动残余力量，彻底肃清，对内实行工人，农民，小资产阶级，和民族资产阶级的联合民主专政，以工农联盟为基础，而以工人阶级为领导，努力发展生产，造福人民；对外则与国际革命力量团结一致，促进世界持久和平。我与所有在座的代表先生们一样，对这次大会的成功，怀有坚定的信念。
    （十二）美洲华侨代表
    司徒美堂讲话
    人民政协各位代表先生：
    我们全国人民在中国共产党领导下，把一个凶恶的封建法西斯专政的国民党反动统治基本上打倒了，现在我们大家来共同协商建立人民民主共和国的大计，这真是我国有史以来的第一件大喜事。我代表美洲华侨回国出席这个会议，飞越半个地球跑到北平，用最热烈的心情，向大会致贺。
    海外华侨一向热爱祖国，效力革命，但从来得不到祖国真正的爱护，以致在海外受帝国主义的凌辱压迫，回来国内便受贪官污吏的剥削欺骗，所以很长时期热望一个独立自由民主统一的新中国的出现。今天，由于中国人民解放军和全国人民的英勇奋斗，这个愿望是达到了，使我们感到万分的兴奋！
    华侨远处异地，国内情势，未能透澈明了，现在我回到解放了的北平一看，觉得中共人员那种刻苦踏实英勇牺牲的精神，对建国大计那种反复协商，尊重各方面意见的优良政治风度，实在值得我们佩服，这就是中国共产党有资格领导全国人民并进而取得彻底胜利的最大因素和保证，我们华侨相信，我们的新政府是为争取广大人民利益的，我们坚决表示拥护！同时相信，我们既能把三大敌人打倒，我们就有办法把祖国搞好。比如，我们工业落后，要赶紧的生产建设，侨胞在新政府切实保障华侨正当权益的号召下，一定会踊跃投资，返到祖国来，中国有无尽的富藏，尚未开发，协助政府把自己的祖国搞好，这是我们华侨义不容辞的责任。
    在达到完全胜利以及建设新中国的途径上，一切明明暗暗大大小小的反动派必将继续施其阴谋毒计，挑拨离间，封锁破坏，所以困难是有的，但我们相信任何困难是能够克服的，我们必须继续团结奋斗，继续发挥这种民主精神，在毛主席英明领导之下不断前进，巩固这个胜利，并发展这个胜利！
    谨祝大会完全成功。　　　　　　　　　（新华社北平二十一日电）
