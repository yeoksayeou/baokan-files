　　Inner Mongolia Hulun Buir League Holds Nadam Fair
  　Brisk Trade and Active Entertainment
    [Special dispatch from our reporter in Hailar on the 23rd] The Nadam Fair (note) of the Hulun Buir League (Hulunbuir and Naiman Muren League) in Inner Mongolia was held at the Ganzhuer Temple in Dongxinba Banner of the league. It started on the 15th of this month and ended on the 21st. More than 30 units, including various banners and Somu governments, schools, departments of the league government, public-owned stores, and cooperatives in the industrial zone of the league, as well as more than 420 private merchants and more than 10,000 herdsmen from various places, attended the fair. During the fair, the masses generally engaged in commodity trade. The league government systematically organized various cultural and entertainment activities, such as sports meets, exhibitions, horse racing, archery, and various forms of publicity meetings and evening parties. In this series of activities, the government's call for developing production was repeatedly implemented, and in-depth explanations were carried out, achieving the desired results. During the seven-day fair, more than 13,000 head of cattle and sheep were traded, and more than 500 horses were sold, along with large quantities of rice, flour, and cloth. According to incomplete statistics, the total trade value reached more than 500 million yuan (25 billion Inner Mongolia currency). In the process of trading, state-owned stores led the market with sufficient materials and fair prices, and therefore received widespread praise from the herdsmen. Taking brick tea as an example, in the past, one sheep could only be exchanged for one brick, but now it can be exchanged for three. In order to take care of the lives of poor herdsmen, some coarse grains were sold at prices lower than cost. Due to the improvement of the people's lives, their purchasing power has also increased. Herdsmen in the four banners of the pastoral area alone purchased 30 Lele carts, which also shows that the enthusiasm of the masses for production has increased. This enthusiasm for production was encouraged by the government at the conference. Various charts, paintings, and photographs in the exhibition room illustrated the achievements of the herdsmen in the region in fighting against natural disasters under the leadership of the government. Thanks to the widespread livestock epidemic prevention and wolf hunting campaigns this year, livestock losses have been greatly reduced. On the other hand, livestock breeding has greatly increased, and the total number of livestock in the league has increased from more than 660,000 to more than 900,000 (including sheep). Many models have emerged in the livestock production movement.
    The conference also featured exciting performances such as horse racing and archery, and selected outstanding archers and children who are good at riding. The mixed-breed fine horses raised by the Chabuli Buryats were the most outstanding. In addition to spiritual encouragement, the government rewarded everyone with items worth 2 million yuan (100 million Mongolian currency). The Northeast Film Studio and the Inner Mongolia Cultural Troupe organized a total of six evening parties, screened films three times, and performed three times during the conference. Every time, the audience rushed to the venue, singing various Mongolian and Chinese songs, and the entire conference fully demonstrated a united and joyful atmosphere.
    (Note) The Nadam Fair of the Hulun Buir League in Inner Mongolia was formerly the Ganzhuer Tent Fair, which was originally an economic and religious gathering. It originated 160 years ago, when merchants from Northeast China and Guannei (areas south of the Great Wall) brought large quantities of goods here every year on the first day of the eighth month of the lunar calendar for trade. After five days of gathering, it was the time for local herdsmen to go to the temple to worship Buddha and pray to the gods, which often lasted for half a month. It was not until last year that the government changed the name of the meeting to its current name. "Nadam" means cultural entertainment in Mongolian. The significance of the "Nadam" conference is to transform it into a more positive and constructive gathering with educational significance. Although this conference is for one league, the scope of trade is very wide, with merchants coming from thousands of miles away. The number of goods sold and raw materials exported has always been large, so the conference has important significance for the entire Inner Mongolia economy. (Ai Fang)

　　内蒙呼纳盟举行那达慕大会
  　交易旺盛文娱活跃
    【本报记者海拉尔二十三日专电】内蒙呼纳盟（呼伦贝尔与那文慕仁盟）那达慕（注）大会，在该盟东新巴旗甘珠尔庙举行。于本月十五日开始，二十一日结束。会上到有该盟工业区各旗及索木政府、学校、盟政府所属各部门、各公营商店及合作社共三十余单位，另有私商四百二十余家及各地牧民达万余人。大会期间，群众普遍进行了商品贸易。盟政府有计划的组织了各种文化娱乐活动，如运动会、展览会、赛马、射箭及各种形式的宣传会、晚会。在这一连串的活动中，反复贯彻了政府发展生产的号召；并进行了深入的解释收到了预期的效果。七天会期中，牛羊的成交达一万三千余头，马五百余匹，米、面、布匹等货销出都很多。据不完全统计，交易总值达五亿元以上（二百五十亿内蒙币）。在进行交易中，公营商店以充足的物资与公道的价格领导了市场，因此得到了牧民们普遍的称赞。以砖茶为例，在过去一般的一只羊只能换到一块，现在则能换到三块。为了照顾贫苦牧民的生活，有的粗粮则以低于成本的价钱出售。由于群众生活的向上，其购买力亦提高。只牧业区四个旗的牧民即购进勒勒车达三十辆；同时也说明了群众生产情绪提高。这种生产热情在大会上得到了政府的鼓励。展览室的各种图表、绘画、照片说明着该区牧民们在政府领导下与自然灾害作斗争所获得的成绩。由于今年广泛进行了牧畜防疫及打狼运动，使牧畜损失减少很多。另一方面，牧畜繁殖大大增加，全盟由六十六万多头增至九十万头以上（羊包括在内）。在牧畜生产运动中涌现出了很多模范。
    会上又表演了赛马、射箭等精彩节目，选出了优越射手和善骑的儿童等。以叉布利牙特人所养的混合种良马最出色。政府除精神上予以鼓励之外，并以二百万圆（一亿圆蒙币）的物品奖励大家。东北电影工作队及内蒙文工团于大会期间共组织六个晚会，放映电影三次，演出三次。每次观众都是争先到场，唱着蒙汉文的各种歌曲，整个大会中充分表现出团结愉快的空气。
    （注）内蒙呼纳盟那达慕大会，其前身是该地甘珠尔帐会，原为一个经济的、宗教的集会。源起于一百六十年前，每年旧历八月一日东北及关内各地商人携带大批货物来此进行贸易。集会五天之后，即为当地牧民到庙上拜佛求神期。先后相连，往往达半月之久。直至去年政府始将该会改称今名。“那达慕”为蒙语文化娱乐之意。“那达慕”大会的意义是要把它变成个更具有积极建设性的有教育意义的集会。这个会虽然是一个盟的，但贸易的范围很广，有远来自数千里外的客商；推销的货物及输出原料品数字历来很大，因之该会在整个内蒙经济上有重要意义。　（艾方）
