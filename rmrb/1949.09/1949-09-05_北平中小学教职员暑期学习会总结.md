　　Summary of the Summer Study Session for Primary and Secondary School Teachers and Staff in Beiping

　　I. Characteristics of the Study Session

　　Our summer study session began on July 15th, lasted for a month, and successfully concluded on August 15th. More than 5,800 people participated in the study, almost including all colleagues from public and private primary and secondary schools in Beiping. Everyone concentrated all their energy and spent their summer vacation in pleasant and fulfilling study, completing the scheduled learning tasks. The characteristic of this study session is that the study period is short but concentrated. However, except for a few who stayed on campus, the vast majority of students lived scattered in their own homes, which is also different from the situation at China University and the Military and Political University.

　　II. Analysis of Students' Ideological Situation

　　"What revolution? Isn't it just a power struggle and the carving up of territory!" "Which is more important, mental labor or physical labor?" "Some revolutionaries are also intellectuals, why not say intellectuals lead the revolution?" "The People's Liberation Army is mostly of peasant origin, can't they also lead the revolution?" "The proletariat has no knowledge, how can they lead the revolution?" "Now I teach to serve the people, I taught to serve the people in the past, how can you say education is not detached?" "Why lean to one side?" "The United States also has some benefits for China." "The United States has the atomic bomb, what if World War III breaks out?" ... These kinds of questions were once entrenched in the minds of most primary and secondary school teachers and staff in Beiping when it was first liberated. After several months of study and education through facts, there have been some changes. But either the solutions are not thorough, knowing what is happening but not why; or they remain unchanged, with little change.

　　Due to ideological confusion, many colleagues mistakenly believed that our summer study session would be like the "training classes" and "summer camps" run by the reactionaries. So they came to participate in the study "because everyone else is coming, so I'm coming too," "afraid of being said to be lagging behind if I don't come," "to secure my job for the next semester," "to gild myself, so it's easier to find a job," and so on. Although most people participated for the sake of learning, their purposes were also very complex, some "to improve their professional skills," some "to understand Marxism-Leninism during the summer vacation," and others "to learn a bunch of nouns and a set of statements so that they can deal with students in the future," and so on.

　　Regarding study methods, everyone unanimously hoped to be able to listen to large reports every day, which would be faster and easier than reading books on their own.

　　III. Study Guidelines

　　Based on the ideological situation of the students, after repeated research, we finally decided to first study the most basic things, that is, to solve the problem of outlook on life. That is, to obtain an ideological weapon and begin to study dialectical materialism and historical materialism. But because the time was too short, we decided to only focus on studying two points of historical materialism this summer – the labor viewpoint and the class viewpoint. By studying these two basic viewpoints, some minor issues would be easily resolved. At the same time, we decided that learning should be based on conscious willingness: free participation, without any coercion.

　　IV. Study Methods

　　In order to enable students to think deeply about problems,展开讨论, and gain a profound and確凿 understanding, our study method was based on self-study, combined with small group discussions and listening to enlightening large reports, while linking to one's past and present thoughts and actions, and appropriately using the weapons of criticism and self-criticism.

　　Because there was no suitable place to accommodate so many people for concentrated study, we took care of the convenience of colleagues scattered throughout the city to travel back and forth, and used the school sites in ten different regions to establish study branches as places for small group discussions. The large reports were held under the awning of the general assembly, and we specially built a large awning that could accommodate 7,000 people for the large reports.

　　The general assembly printed a variety of reference books and compiled the study newspaper (a total of seven issues) to assist students in their studies.

　　The Central Propaganda Department, the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, the Marxism-Leninism Institute, the Education Department of the North China People's Government, the Municipal Government, the Municipal Party Committee... and many other organs supported our study with manpower and materials.

　　V. Gains

　　A month of study has ended. Based on individual study summaries, the results of two reviews, and the summaries of the branch and general assemblies, we have seen the following gains:

　　(1) Preliminary understanding of the labor viewpoint, class and class struggle

　　Naturally, there are differences in degree here. However, in general, those who participated in the study have gained a concept.

　　"I always thought that landlords supported tenants and factory owners supported workers." "Workers and peasants live in poverty, I always thought that was because they had no education, were incompetent, so I pitied them very much." "I used to be very capable of labor. Washing clothes, cooking, carrying water... But I was afraid of being seen, embarrassed. My hands are so rough, I'm afraid people will laugh at me, so I always wear gloves when I go out." ... After examining their past attitudes towards labor and working people in this way, the students have recognized their mistakes and further valued labor and working people. So, when they returned home, if the toilet was too dirty, they cleaned the feces themselves. If the water tank was empty, they went to carry water themselves. If their clothes were dirty, they no longer waited for the servant to wash them. Seeing their wives sweating profusely and busy, they also felt ashamed and began to help with the work.

　　"Marxism-Leninism saved me." The wife said this after understanding the reason for her husband's help.

　　Some people returned to school and led the students to rebuild the collapsed wall; some called on their neighbors to work together to pave a section of road.

　　In short, recognizing the significance of labor in creating the world and no longer feeling that labor is shameful is a most common gain in the summer study.

　　This gain also corrected the erroneous view of "heroes make the times." "History is created by millions of working people" - everyone began to have this understanding of history.

　　After studying class struggle, in addition to recognizing that class struggle is the driving force of social development, colleagues further satisfactorily resolved several issues that had been entangled in the past:

　　The first issue resolved was "Is education above class?" "Originally, education is a tool of class struggle, serving a certain class in a certain period. Then, when I taught under the rule of the reactionaries in the past, I was serving the reactionaries. I was used by others and thought I was above class and noble, what a fool!" - This represents the conclusion of many colleagues. In the review questions, everyone unanimously wrote: "Education is not above class"; at the same time, they no longer felt that they were "detached," and universally expressed their desire to return to the ranks of the working class.

　　The second issue resolved was the Soviet Union issue. All kinds of smears against the Soviet Union and distorted propaganda that harmed the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples revealed their ugly and shameful original forms under such truth: "If we stand on the position of the masses of the people and the proletariat, we must want the Northeast and the whole country to be liberated as soon as possible. Was the Soviet Union's liberation of the Northeast and helping the Chinese people defend Lushun and Dalian beneficial or harmful to China and the liberation of the Northeast? Beneficial. If it's beneficial, what are we against?"

　　So, the following gains were written in the summary: "Standing firm on the class position and then looking at the Sino-Soviet issue, I feel that all doubts have been eliminated." "The Soviet Union stationed troops in Lushun and Dalian, it turned out to be harmful to the reactionaries, no wonder they clamored against it! Thinking about it now, I was completely confused when I participated in the anti-Soviet parade back then!"

　　The third issue resolved was the land reform issue. Many colleagues from landlord backgrounds who hated land reform the most knew that land reform was beneficial to the majority of peasants, and that their past opposition to land reform and sympathy for landlords were all based on the interests of the landlord class.

　　The fourth issue resolved was the party issue. They further recognized the Communist Party and no longer equated it with the Kuomintang. No longer doubted and feared it. The Chinese revolution was no longer seen as a struggle between parties. Seeing that the status of the working people had been improved and that educators were valued, they recognized that the victory of the Liberation War was indeed not a "dynastic change" but a "world turned upside down."

　　Attitudes towards class struggle have also changed as a result.

　　"I knew about class struggle before, but I felt that it had nothing to do with me, and I adopted an attitude of avoiding it. In the future, I must stand on the position of the proletariat." Someone wrote in the summary: "If everyone doesn't participate, how can the unreasonable system be overthrown?"

　　After studying class struggle, a religious colleague knew that the reactionary rulers would not automatically withdraw from the stage of history, and began to doubt the religious saying of "love your enemies," believing that enemies can only be "fought," not "loved." After studying class struggle, 610 students who had participated in reactionary parties and groups automatically betrayed the classes they originally represented and confessed in small group discussions.

　　Of course, we cannot therefore say that colleagues have completely and truly established a labor viewpoint and a class struggle viewpoint in the summer study; but it is a very valuable gain to have a preliminary understanding of these two basic viewpoints and to solve some problems in a short month. We believe that this is the main gain in the summer study.

　　(2) Changed learning attitude. Due to the different purposes of the colleagues in participating in the study, they showed different attitudes at the beginning of the study: some were actively learning; some were reluctantly learning; some were perfunctory, only concerned about: "Will a graduation certificate be issued after the study?" some flattered the group leader, always saying "yes, yes, yes" to the group leader's words; some were afraid of saying the wrong thing and remained silent.

　　After a week of study, everyone felt the free atmosphere in the group and the democratic and humble style of the group leader, and no longer felt that the group leader and the large group leader were sent by the Communist Party to monitor everyone's thoughts and actions. They felt close to the Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members, and friendships gradually developed among the students in the group. In this way, everyone's learning attitude changed, so in the last week, braving the intense heat and on the eve of the start of school, busy from morning to afternoon, not only did they not complain, but their interest increased day by day. On the day the study ended, this regretful voice could be heard everywhere: "Today is the last class, will there be a winter vacation?"

　　"What's the use of small group discussions? No one is much better than anyone else, after discussing for a long time, what you know is still that little bit," "It's better to read books at home, how can there be any progress in discussion? It's a waste of time." ... These kinds of doubts about small group discussions have been buried in a month of practical learning experience. Everyone generally realized that the combination of individual self-study and collective discussion is indeed the most effective learning method, and that criticism and self-criticism is also the most useful weapon for transforming thoughts.

　　"Once we discuss, I realize that my understanding of the problem is not deep enough: I know what is happening, but not why. After the discussion, the understanding is improved."

　　"I was convinced that my understanding was correct and reasonable, but who knew that after everyone's discussion, my opinion was wrong. Fortunately, we discussed it."

　　"I read this kind of book myself, it takes a lot of effort, no matter how many times I read it, I still can't remember it. I don't know why, but after discussing it once, I can remember everything clearly."

　　These are all new sayings about small group discussions from the students.

　　Each branch also used mutual aid groups, the study abroad system, group challenges, the command platform, and recreational activities to supplement and enrich the learning content and adjust the learning life. Under these efforts, the mood for learning has also been improved. Not only did they like small group discussions, but they also no longer felt that reading books was a chore when they went home to study on their own. Many colleagues admitted that they did not read much in the past, and if they did read, it was mostly something light. But "after studying, it's like I've found the path, I can start to chew on some theoretical books." They said.

　　(3) Established a new work attitude. When conducting self-criticism, the colleagues in each group reviewed their past work attitudes:

　　"I am irresponsible. I never ask how much the students understand when I teach."

　　"I am very serious, but that is for personal reputation and job."

　　"When I used to enroll new students in school, I always took those children with fine skin, fair complexion, and neat and beautiful clothes. - At that time, I was very reasonable, because I felt that this kind of children were all children of the upper class, and only they were promising."

　　"Not only do I not teach well myself, but I also gossip behind the backs of those who work hard."

　　After reviewing in this way, many people wrote in the summary as if they were swearing: "I must go back to school and teach well." "I will do as Director Liu instructed." "I will take good care of the children of workers and peasants." "In the future, I will wholeheartedly serve the people." and other solemn sentences.

　　Recently, elementary schools have already started classes. According to the reflections of many colleagues in schools, the atmosphere in the school has changed. Colleagues are kind and close, like brothers and sisters, and they all show that they care about the work of the school and are willing to directly offer opinions to the school or undertake work.

　　(4) Great unity of teachers in primary and secondary schools throughout the city. In the past, not only was there no contact between colleagues in this school and that school, but even the teachers and staff in the same school did not come into contact with each other, or rarely came into contact with each other. This situation was even more common in middle schools. After teaching, each person took their books and went home, like strangers, unrelated to each other, and at most said "The weather is hahaha today" when they met.

　　After a month of study, meeting each other sincerely, at the end, they were reluctant to part with their friends in the group. Dinners, trips, taking commemorative photos, printing yearbooks, and other activities of parting were held in each group. Some even planned to build the group into a permanent organization, maintain regular contact, and hold regular gatherings to exchange work experiences and learning experiences. Although this was only a short month of study, and this was only the beginning of the study, for many people, it meant the beginning of a new life, and they especially cherished it and cherished it. They requested a permanent commemoration.

　　All of these illustrate the same thing - the great unity of primary and secondary school colleagues. This phenomenon of unity has never existed in the past.

　　Therefore, we believe that this is also an important gain of the summer study.

　　(5) In addition, there is another noteworthy gain, that is, in this study session, a group of cadres who can lead the study were cultivated, 89 Communist Youth League members were developed, and a large number of activists emerged.

　　VI. Experiences and Lessons

　　In such a short period of time, organizing such a large-scale study session and obtaining such gains is of course mainly due to the rapid development of the victorious situation of the revolution, the students maintaining a full learning mood from beginning to end, and the hard work of the cadres who led the study.

　　The following points are worth mentioning:

　　(1) Correct study guidelines. This study decided to focus on studying the two basic viewpoints of Marxism-Leninism. After specific implementation, it has been proved that this guideline is correct. This study session confirmed that the transformation of intellectuals must first start with studying theory. And studying theory must first study the laws of social development. In this way, many minor problems will be easily solved. For example, the Sino-Soviet issue, the two lecture meetings held by the Beiping Education Union in half a year, and the discussions in the schools have not solved the problem to everyone's satisfaction. But after studying the class viewpoint, the problem was clarified. Because the learning content selected in this short-term study session was small, but it was the most basic thing. So we had more concrete gains. If we had selected more learning content, we would not have been able to study in depth. If the selected content was not the most basic, then the problem could not be solved ideologically. For example, if we first studied the problem of "who to serve," although everyone could say in words that they should serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, they would not be able to understand why they should serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and it is very likely that they would incorrectly think that serving them is because they are too miserable, pitiful... and so on, and would not fundamentally analyze the problem with the labor viewpoint and the class viewpoint.

　　(2) Correct study methods. What needs to be mentioned here is: first, learning is completely based on conscious willingness and not forced at all. Even criticism and self-criticism were gradually unfolded under the principle of consciousness. The second is to supplement the shortcomings of individual self-study with collective learning, and then appropriately cooperate with enlightening reports. This study method is very good. The third is friendship, unity, consideration for colleagues, care for the elderly and female colleagues, and cooperation with recreational activities, so that the study has always been carried out in a lively and pleasant atmosphere.

　　VII. Conclusion

　　The task of our summer study is to improve our thinking and achieve the preliminary effect of ideological transformation. Checking the gains of this study, except for a very small number of people, we can generally say that we have achieved this task. Of course, this is only a beginning. The transformation of intellectuals is a long and arduous process. As Chairman Mao said in a word about our study this time: "It's just like finishing the first step of the Long March." Only by continuous and unremitting efforts in learning can we thoroughly complete the ideological transformation.

　　北平中小学教职员暑期学习会总结
  　一、学习会的特点
    我们这次的暑期学习会，从七月十五日开始，经过一个月，到八月十五日已经胜利地结束。参加学习的共有五千八百多人，几乎包括了北平所有公私立中小学的同仁。大家都是集中了全副精力，在愉快、充实的学习里度过暑假，完成了预定的学习任务。这个学习会的特点是：学习的期限短然而集中。不过，学员们除了少数住宿外，绝大多数还都是分散地住在自己家里，这一点和华大、军大的情形也不相同。
    二、学员思想情况的分析
    “革什么命，还不是争权夺势，割据地盘！”“脑力劳动重要，还是体力劳动重要？”“有些革命家也是知识分子，怎么不说知识分子领导革命？”“解放军都是农民出身，不是也能领导革命吗？”“无产阶级没有知识，怎么能领导革命？”“现在我教书是为人民服务，从前教书也是为人民服务呀，怎么说教育不是超然的？”“为什么一边倒？”“美国对中国也有些好处。”“美国有原子弹，如果第三次世界大战爆发了怎么办？”………………这类的问题在北平初解放时，曾经盘据在大多数中小学教职员的头脑里。经过几个月的学习和事实的教育，有了若干的改变。但是或者是解决得并不彻底，知其然而不知其所以然；或者是原封不动，变化较小。
    由于思想的混乱，不少同仁误认为我们的暑期学习会将和反动派所办的“训练班”“夏令营”一样。所以来参加学习是为了“人家都来我也来”，“不来怕人说落伍”，“保障下学期的职业”，“镀镀金，找职业好有门路”等等。为学习而参加的虽然占多数，目的却也很复杂，有的是“为了提高业务”，有的“为了在暑假里学通马列主义”，还有人“为的是学会一堆名词，一套说法，将来好应付学生”等等。
    关于学习方法，大家一致地希望能够每天听大报告，比自己看书学得快而且容易。
    三、学习方针
    根据学员们的思想情况，经过我们反复研究，最后决定应先学习最基本的东西，那就是解决人生观的问题。也就是要取得一种思想上的武器，开始学习辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义。但因为时间太短，所以我们又决定在这个暑假里只集中学习历史唯物主义的两个论点——劳动观点，阶级观点。学习了这两个基本观点，一些枝节的问题就容易得到解决。同时我们决定学习是建立在自觉自愿的基础上：自由参加，不带任何强制。
    四、学习方法
    为了使学员能对问题深思熟虑，展开讨论，得到深刻、确凿的认识，所以我们学习的方法是以自学为主，结合着小组的讨论和听启发性的大报告，同时联系到自己过去和现在的思想行动，适当地运用批评与自我批评的武器。
    因为没有适当的地方可以容纳这样多的人集中学习，我们照顾着分散在市内各处同仁往返的便利，利用了十个不同地区的学校校址设立了学习分会，作为小组讨论的地方。大报告则在总会的席棚下进行，我们特为作大报告搭了一个能容七千人的大棚。
    总会印刷了多种参考书，编印了学习报（共出了七期），辅助学员们进行学习。
    中央宣传部、团中央、马列学院、华北人民政府教育部、市政府、市委……等许多机关以人力、物力支援着我们的学习。
    五、收获
    一个月的学习结束了。根据个人学习总结、两次复习的结果以及分会总会的总结，我们看出了下面的一些收获：
    （一）初步认识劳动观点、阶级与阶级斗争
    自然这里面还有程度的差异。不过，大体说来，参加学习的人都已获得了一个概念。
    “我一直都以为是地主养活佃户，工厂老板养活工人。”“工人农民生活苦，我总认为那是由于他们没有学问，低能，所以我很可怜他们。”“我过去倒是很能劳动。洗衣作饭，挑水……。可是就怕让人碰上，难为情。两只手粗极了，我怕人笑话，出门总要戴手套。”……这样地检查了自己过去对于劳动和劳动人民的态度后，学员们都纷纷地认识了自己的错误，并且进一步地重视劳动和劳动人民了。于是，回到家里，厕所太脏了，就自己掏粪。水缸干了，就自己去挑水。衣服脏了，不再等待用人洗。看见妻子汗流浃背地忙碌，也自己觉得惭愧，开始动手帮助操作了。
    “马列主义救了我”。妻子明白了丈夫帮忙的原故后这样说。
    还有的人回到学校里，带领着学生把倒塌的墙砌好；有的号召街坊，共同下手，铺好一段路。
    总之，认识了劳动创造世界的意义，不再觉得劳动可耻，这是暑期学习中一个最普遍的收获。
    这个收获同时又纠正了“英雄造时势”的错误观点。“历史是千千万万劳动人民创造的”——大家开始对历史有了这样的认识。
    学习了阶级斗争后，同仁们除开认识到阶级斗争是社会发展的原动力外，更进而圆满地解决了几个在过去曾经纠缠不清的问题：
    第一个解决了的问题是“教育是不是超阶级的？”“原来教育是阶级斗争的工具，是在一定时期为一定阶级服务的。那么我过去在反动派统治下教书，就是给反动派服务了。受了人家利用，还以为超阶级、清高、真是傻瓜！”——这代表着很多同仁的结论。在复习题里，大家一致地写着：“教育不是超阶级的”；同时，也不再觉得自己是“超然的”了，普遍表示归队的要求，希望回到工人阶级中来。
    第二个得到解决的是苏联问题。各种污蔑苏联，中伤中国人民对苏友谊的歪曲宣传，都在这样的真理下显出了丑陋可耻的原形：“我们如果站在人民大众、无产阶级的立场上，必定愿意东北和全国早日解放。苏联解放东北，帮助中国人民守卫了旅大，对中国，对东北的解放有利还是有害？有利。有利我们还反对什么？”
    于是，在总结里就写了这样的收获：“站稳了阶级立场再去看中苏问题，我觉得一切怀疑都消除了。”“苏联驻兵旅顺大连，原来是对反动派有害，怪不得他们叫嚣着反对！现在想想，我当年参加反苏大游行，简直糊涂死了！”
    第三个得到解决的是土地改革问题。许多最痛恨土地改革的地主出身的同仁，知道了土地改革是对大多数的农民有利的，而自己过去反对土地改革，同情地主，都是从地主阶级的利益出发的。
    第四个得到解决的是党派问题。进一步地认识了共产党，不再拿它与国民党等量齐观。不再对它怀疑恐惧。对于中国的革命，不再看作是党派之争。看到了劳动人民的地位被提高，教育工作者被重视，因而就认识了解放战争的胜利，的确不是“改朝换代”，而是“天翻地覆”。
    对阶级斗争的态度也因此改变了。
    “以前我知道阶级斗争，但觉得那和我无关，我是采取退避三舍的态度。以后我一定要站到无产阶级的立场上。”总结里有人这样写着：“要是大家都不参加，不合理的制度怎么会打倒呢？”
    一位信教的同仁在学习阶级斗争之后，知道反动统治者不会自动退出历史舞台，就开始对宗教里“爱仇敌”的说法发生了怀疑，认为对于仇敌是只可以“斗争”，不可以“爱”的。六百一十多个参加过反动党团的学员，学习过阶级斗争后自动地背叛了原来代表的阶级，在小组讨论中坦白出来。
    诚然，我们并不能因此就说同仁们在暑期学习中，已完全真正地建立了劳动观点，阶级斗争观点；但在短短的一个月里能对这两个基本观点有了初步的认识，并进而解决了一些问题，已是很宝贵的收获。我们认为这是暑期学习中主要的收获。
    （二）改变了学习态度。　同仁们由于参加学习的目的不同，在开始学习时，便表现着不同的态度：有积极学习的；有勉强学习的；有的敷衍了事，只关心着：“学完后发给毕业证书吗？”有迎合小组长，对小组长的话永远表示“是是是”的；有怕说错了话，永远沉默不言的。
    学习了一周之后，大家感受到了小组里的自由空气和小组长的民主、谦虚的作风，又经过小组长改选，不再觉得小组长、大组长是共产党派来监视大家思想行动的了。对于党团员同志感到了亲切，同组里学友之间逐渐建立起友情。这样，大家的学习态度改变了，所以到了最末一周，冒着酷热，又正在开学前夕，从上午忙到下午，不但没有怨言，反而兴趣日增。学习结束的那天，在各处可以听到这种惋惜的声音：“今天是最后一课了，寒假还有吗？”
    “小组讨论有啥用？谁也不比谁强多少，讨论半天，知道的还不是那点东西，”“还不如自己在家里看书呢，讨论能有什么进步？白耽误时间。”…………这类对小组讨论的怀疑，已经湮没在一个月实际学习的经验里了。大家普遍地体会到个人自学与集体讨论相结合，实在是最有效的学习方法，而批评与自我批评也是改造思想最有用的武器。
    “一讨论起来，我才知道自己对问题认识得不深刻：知其然，不知其所以然。讨论之后，在认识上就提高一步。”
    “我满以为自己懂的正确、有理，谁知经过大家讨论，原来我的意见错了，幸亏讨论讨论。”
    “我自己看这类书，费好大力气，看多少遍，还是记不住。不知怎么，讨论一次，就能什么都记得清清楚楚。”
    这些都是学员们对小组讨论新的说法。
    各分会更利用互助小组、留学制度、小组挑战、点将台、文娱活动等等方式来补充和丰富学习内容，调剂学习生活。在这些努力之下，学习的情绪也因之提高了。不但欢喜了小组讨论，而且回家自学时也不再觉得看书是件苦事。许多同仁承认自己过去是不大读书的，偶而读读，也多是些轻松的东西。但是“经过学习，好象摸着了门径，我开始能啃点理论书籍了。”他们这样说。
    （三）建立新的工作态度。　进行自我批评的时候，各组的同仁都检讨了自己过去的工作态度：
    “我不负责。我教书从来就不问学生懂多少。”
    “我倒很认真，但那是为了个人的名誉和饭碗。”
    “我从前在学校录取新生，向来是取那些皮肤细、长得白净清秀、穿得整齐漂亮的孩子。——那时候我还满有理，因为我觉得这一类孩子都是上流社会人的子弟，只有他们才是可造就的。”
    “我不但自己不好好教书，别人卖力气，我还背地里说过闲话。”
    这样地检讨了以后，许多人纷纷地在总结里象宣誓一样地写着：“我一定回到学校好好教书。”“我要照柳局长指示的去做。”“我要好好照顾工农子弟。”“以后我要全心全意为人民服务。”等庄严的句子。
    最近，小学都已经上课了，据许多学校同仁们的反映，说：学校里的气象变了。同事们亲亲切切，象兄弟姐妹一样，而且都表现得很关心学校的工作，肯直率地对学校提意见，或承担工作了。
    （四）全市中小学教员大团结　过去，不仅这个学校与那个学校里的同仁之间没有往还，就连同一学校里的教职员同仁彼此间也不来往，或很少来往。在中学里，这种情形更为普遍。教完书，各人夹着书包回家，井水不犯河水，彼此不相干，见了面也顶多来个“今天天气哈哈哈”。
    经过一个月的学习，真诚相见，在结束的时候，舍不得和同组的朋友们分手。聚餐呀，旅行呀，拍纪念像，印同学录呀，一些惜别的活动在每个小组里举行着。甚至计划将小组建为永久性的团体，保持经常联系，定期聚会，交流工作经验和学习心得。虽然，这只是短短一个月的学习，这只是学习的开端，但对于许多人说来，却意味着新生的开端，而特别珍重它、爱惜它。要求一个永久的纪念。
    这些都说明着同一件事——中小学同仁的大团结。这团结现象是过去从来没有过的。
    种所以我们认为这也是暑期学习的一个重要收获。
    （五）此外，还有一个值得重视的收获，那就是在这个学习会中培养了一批能够领导学习的干部，发展了八十九个青年团员，涌现了大批积极分子。
    六、经验教训
    在这样短的时间里，搞这样大规模的学习会，得到这样的收获，当然主要的是因为革命胜利形势的迅速发展，学员从始到终都保持饱满的学习情绪，以及领导学习的干部的努力工作的结果。
    这里值得提出的经验，有以下几点：
    （一）正确的学习方针。这次学习决定把重点放在学习马列主义的两个基本观点上。经过具体实施，已经证明这个方针是正确的。这次的学习会证实了：知识分子的改造首先是要从学习理论着手。而学习理论，则首先学习社会发展的规律。这样，许多枝节问题都会迎刃而解的。例如中苏问题吧，半年来教联举办的两次讲演会，学校里的讨论会，都没有将问题解决得使大家满意。但是学习了阶级观点，问题就澄清了。由于在这个短期学习会中选择的学习内容少，但却是最基本的东西。所以我们有了比较具体的收获。如果我们选择的学习内容多，则必定不能深入地学习。如果选择的不是最基本的东西，则不能从思想上解决问题。譬如，倘若我们先学习“为谁服务”的问题，尽管大家都能口头上说应该为工农兵服务了，可是必定不能理解到为什么要为工农兵服务，很可能不正确地认为为他们服务是由于他们太苦，可怜……等等，而不会用劳动观点和阶级观点去基本地分析问题。
    （二）正确的学习方法。这里要提到的是：第一，学习完全是本诸自觉自愿，毫不勉强。就连批评与自我批评也是在自觉的原则下逐步展开的。第二是以集体学习补个人自学之不足，再适当地配合启发性的报告。这种学习方法是很好的。第三是友爱，团结，对于同仁的体贴，对于老年人与女同仁的照顾再配合文娱活动，使学习一直是在活泼愉快的气氛中进行。
    七、结语
    我们暑期学习的任务是要提高我们的思想，达到思想改造的初步效果。检查这次学习的收获，除开极少数的人以外，我们一般地说，是达成了这个任务的。自然，这还只是一个开始。知识分子的改造是一个长远的艰苦的过程。我们这次的学习，用毛主席的一句话说：“只不过象万里长征走完了第一步”。只有继续不断的努力学习，才能彻底完成思想的改造。
