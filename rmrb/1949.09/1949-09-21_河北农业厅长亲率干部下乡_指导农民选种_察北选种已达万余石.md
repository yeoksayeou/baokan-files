  　Guiding Farmers in Seed Selection
  　Over 10,000 Shi of Seed Selected in Chabei
    [Baoding Dispatch] With the autumn harvest approaching, in order to help farmers select seeds in large quantities, reduce disasters such as pests and diseases, and prepare for next year's large-scale production campaign, Zhang Kerang, Deputy Director of the Hebei Provincial Government's Department of Agriculture, and Zhang Bofan, Deputy Director of the Technical Improvement Department, along with six cadres, departed on the 8th of this month for Tangshan, Tianjin, Tongxian, Xingtai and other special districts to understand and inspect the autumn harvest and wheat planting, and to help and guide farmers in seed selection and wheat seed soaking and mixing techniques.
    [Another Dispatch] In order to improve cotton yield and quality next year, the Hebei Provincial People's Government's Department of Agriculture issued a notice on September 10th to its subordinate special and county areas to mobilize and organize cotton seed selection. It pointed out that in all cotton-growing areas, especially those with relatively good existing cotton seeds, the masses should be mobilized and organized to carry out cotton seed selection. Under the unified arrangement of the Party and government, agricultural departments in various places should specifically grasp and formulate seed selection plans, organize a certain amount of manpower, and combine with Party, government, military, and civilian cadres participating in autumn harvesting to go deep into cotton-growing areas to carry out seed selection; they are required to select a certain amount of improved seeds for next year's improved seed planting.
    [Reported by Our Newspaper] A team of seven people from the Chahar Provincial Government's Technology Extension Team, on the 13th of August, was ordered to go to Chabei to promote seed selection. Under the correct leadership of the Chabei Special Commissioner's Office, they adopted a leadership method that integrated administrative leadership, technical guidance, and mass mobilization, creating a mass seed selection movement. As of September 13th, in one month, in Zhangbei, Shangdu, Kangbao, Shangyi, Baoyuan, and Huade counties, 14,000 shi (municipal shi, same below) of awned wheat and naked oats had been selected. Before the start of the seed selection work, the Chabei Special Commissioner's Office printed 2,000 copies of a booklet entitled "How to Select Seeds", which were distributed to various counties and brought to the experimental area villages by the extension team. In addition to conference arrangements and explanations, excerpts were posted on the blackboard newspapers in each village, and rooftop broadcasts were used for publicity every evening, so that the broad masses and village cadres were ideologically prepared. At the location of the district leading organs, meetings of district and village cadres, old farmers, and primary school teachers were convened to first dispel the concerns of the masses, and then explain that seed selection is to make the seed quality excellent, the harvest period consistent, prevent diseases and pests, increase yields, and facilitate management. Then introduce the seed selection method: find strong ears, facing the sun, with the same color, and use scissors to select the ears completely.

  　指导农民选种
  　察北选种已达万余石
    【保定电】秋收已到，为帮助农民大量选种，减少并虫等灾害，准备明年大生产运动，河北省政府农业厅张克让副厅长及技术改进处副处长张伯范偕同干部六人，于本月八日分赴唐山、天津、通县、邢台等专区，从事了解与检查秋收种麦等工作，并帮助和指导农民进行选种及小麦浸种、拌种技术等事宜。
    【又电】为提高明年棉产量与质量，河北省人民政府农业厅于九月十日通知所属各专、县发动组织棉花选种。指出凡种棉地区，特别是原有棉种较好的地区，应发动与组织群众进行棉花选种，在党政统一布置下，各地农业部门应具体掌握订出选种计划，组织一定力量，结合参加秋收工作的党、政、军、民干部，深入棉区进行选种；要求选集一定数量的良种，以备明年良种种植。
    【本报讯】察哈尔省府技术推广队一行七人，于八月十三日，奉命赴察北推广选种，在察北专署正确领导下，采用行政领导、技术指导与发动群众三位一体的领导方法，造成群众性的选种运动。至九月十三日一个月当中，在张北、商都、康保、尚义、宝源、化德六县，已完成大芒麦、莜麦选种一万四千石（市石，下同）。选种工作开始前，察北专署曾印发“怎样选种”小册子两千份，一面分发各县，一面由推广队带至各实验区村。除会议布置讲解外，各村黑板报上摘要登载，每天晚上并利用屋顶广播进行宣传，使广大群众、村干部思想上有所准备。并在区领导机关驻地，召集区、村干部，老农、小学教员会议，首先解除群众顾虑，继即说明选种是为了使种籽品质优良，收获期一致，防除病害，提高产量，管理方便。然后再介绍选种办法：找穗头强大，面向太阳，色泽一样的，完全用剪子穗选。
