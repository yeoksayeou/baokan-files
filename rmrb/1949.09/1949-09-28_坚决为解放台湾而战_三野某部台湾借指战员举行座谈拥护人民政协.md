Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 26th: Taiwan native commanders and fighters of a certain unit of the Third Field Army recently held a forum, unanimously expressing their warm support for the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and resolutely stating that they would use practical actions to liberate Taiwan to fight back against the U.S. imperialist conspiracy of aggression and to welcome the birth of the People's Republic of China. Li Yongjin, a youth who participated in the "February 28th" struggle in 1947, said: "The people of Taiwan, under the 51 years of enslavement by Japanese imperialism, have waged countless heroic struggles and shed a lot of blood. The people of Taiwan, with revolutionary traditions and fighting experience, will never allow any imperialists and Kuomintang reactionaries to enslave us again. We will fight alongside the people of the whole country for the liberation of Taiwan." A Taiwanese student, who was drafted into the army by the Kuomintang reactionaries in 1947 and later revolted and joined the People's Liberation Army during the Shanghai campaign, said indignantly: "U.S. imperialism is establishing a joint Chiang-U.S. naval and air force base in Taiwan, shipping military supplies to Taiwan, assisting the bandit Sun Liren in training troops, forcibly conscripting countless Taiwanese people to conduct anti-people civil war, and carrying out large-scale plundering and massacres in Taiwan, plunging the people of Taiwan into dire straits. We must fight to Taiwan, drive U.S. imperialism out of Taiwan, eliminate the remaining Kuomintang bandits, and liberate all the people of Taiwan!" Zhu Zhongping, Su Chengfu, Pan Qingyu and others of the Gaoshan ethnic group said that the Gaoshan ethnic group had carried out eleven heroic struggles during the era of Japanese imperialist rule, and the people of the Gaoshan ethnic group are now looking forward to cooperating with the People's Liberation Army to quickly liberate Taiwan. When they heard that representatives of the Gaoshan ethnic group attended the CPPCC, they were overjoyed.

　　坚决为解放台湾而战
  　三野某部台湾借指战员举行座谈拥护人民政协
    【新华社南京二十六日电】第三野战军某部台湾借指挥员战斗员，于日前举行座谈会，一致表示热烈拥护中国人民政治协商会议，并坚决表示要以解放台湾的实际行动来回击美帝国主义的侵略阴谋和迎接中华人民共和国的诞生。曾参加一九四七年“二、二八”斗争的青年李永金说：“台湾人民在日本帝国主义五十一年的奴役下，曾顽强地进行了无数次的英勇斗争，流了很多的血。有革命传统和斗争经验的台湾人民，决不允许任何帝国主义者和国民党反动派再奴役我们，我们将和全国人民一道，为解放台湾而战。”一九四七年被国民党反动派抓出来当兵，后在解放上海战役中起义参加人民解放军的台湾学生激愤地说：“美帝国主义在台湾建立蒋美联合海空军基地，运军火到台湾，协助孙匪立人练兵，强抓了无数台湾人民进行反人民的内战并在台湾进行大劫掠和大屠杀，陷台湾人民于水深火热之中。我们一定要打到台湾去，把美帝国主义赶出台湾去，肃清国民党残余匪帮，解放全台湾的人民！”高山族的朱中平、苏诚附、潘清玉等说，高山族在日本帝国主义统治时代曾进行过十一次英勇的斗争，高山族人民现在正期待着配合人民解放军迅速解放台湾。当他们听到高山族的代表出席了中国人民政协的消息时，更是兴奋若狂。
