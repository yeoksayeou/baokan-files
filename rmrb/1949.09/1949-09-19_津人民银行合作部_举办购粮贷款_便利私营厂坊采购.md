　　Tianjin People's Bank Cooperative Department
  　Organizes Grain Purchase Loans
  　Facilitating Procurement by Private Factories and Workshops
  　　　　　Focusing on Supporting the Brick, Tile, Cotton Textile, Wool Textile, and Carpet Industries
    [Tianjin News] Fifty-two private factories and workshops in the city have already registered with the Industry and Commerce Bureau and completed the procedures for purchasing grain with vouchers. The Bureau is currently reviewing applications and writing vouchers. It is expected that after the second of this month, factories can directly purchase grain at the grain market with their vouchers. The Bureau has also agreed with the Cooperative Department of the People's Bank that the department will handle grain purchase loans, initially focusing on supporting the brick and tile, cotton textile, wool textile, and carpet industries. Members of the above four industries who have a formal business license and obtain a grain purchase voucher stamped by the Industry and Commerce Bureau can apply for the loan. To prevent factories and workshops from diverting the loan funds for other purposes, the department will issue receipts to the loan recipients to purchase grain at the grain market, and then the grain market will transfer the funds to the bank.

　　津人民银行合作部
  　举办购粮贷款
  　便利私营厂坊采购
  　　　　　着重扶植砖瓦棉毛地毯四业
    【天津讯】本市私营工厂作坊，已有五十二业在工商局登记，办理凭折购粮手续。该局正审查并写折中，预定本月二日以后，各厂即可持折到粮食市场直接采购。该局并与人民银行合作部商妥，由该部办理购粮贷款，开始时着重扶植砖瓦、棉纺织、毛纺织、地毯等四业。以上四业会员有正式营业证、取得工商局加盖印章购粮凭折，即可申请该项贷购。该部为防止厂坊贷得款项后移做他用，改用单据交贷款户持向粮食市场购粮，再由粮食市场与银行过户。
