　　Hebei Disaster Area Farmers Actively Drain Water and Plant Wheat
　　Tianjin, Hejian, and Fifteen Other Counties Have Drained Three Million Mu of Land
    [Baoding Telegram] Party and government cadres in various parts of Hebei are vigorously leading farmers in disaster areas to actively drain water and plant wheat, and have achieved considerable results. According to statistics from the end of August alone in Changping, Tianjin in the north, and Hejian, Qingyuan, and other fifteen counties in the central region, more than 3.73 million mu of land have been drained. The county party committees in all counties attach great importance to this work. The county committee secretaries and county heads of Jiahe, Tianjin, Wuqing, and other counties personally went to the disaster areas to inspect the water situation and lead the drainage. Duan Mingqin, secretary of the Sixth District Committee of Qingyuan, personally went to various places to measure the depth and observe the terrain, leading the masses to dig 15 drainage outlets on the banks of the Fu River. In order to unify thought and action, Cangxian, Jianguo, Qingxian, and other six counties have established water drainage committees. Joint command posts have been established in areas where counties and villages intersect, using the principles of "farmers all over the world are one family," "saving more crops means less suffering," and "minor interests should be subordinate to major interests." Through party member cadres in each village, the masses were patiently educated, breaking down the mutual isolation of the masses regarding letting water flow naturally and draining water. In areas of Tianjin, Wuqing, and Qingyuan where the terrain is too low and drainage ditches cannot be dug, the masses are organized to bail water or use waterwheels to draw water. According to statistics from six villages in Wuqing, including Daxinzhuang, Huangzhuang, Yangzhuang, and Zhoucun, 1,090 people participated in bailing water, bailing 782 mu of land in one day. The Qingyuan County Party Committee, based on the different terrain of each village, led the masses to use different methods to drain water. Along the lower reaches of the Tang River, where the river water overflowed and flooded, the masses were led to block the breaches and overflowing tributaries, and then dig ditches to guide the water into the main stream. In the water disaster area along the Fu River, the masses were led to open the banks of the Fu River to divert water into the river. Wuqiang County has drained more than 100,000 mu of land. The Hebei Provincial People's Government has issued specific instructions on rapidly draining water and planting wheat, emphasizing that all localities must seize the season and strive to drain water and dry the land to more than 80% before the Autumnal Equinox. Those who cannot drain water before planting wheat must also strive to drain it before freezing, in preparation for early planting of spring wheat and other wheat seedlings next year.

　　河北灾区农民积极排水种麦
  　天津、河间等十五县已排水脱地三百万亩
    【保定电】河北各地党政机关干部正大力领导灾区农民积极排水种麦，已获得不少成绩。仅据北部昌平、天津和中部河间、清苑等十五县八月底的统计，即排水脱地三百七十三万余亩。对这一工作各县县委都很重视。交河、天津、武清等县县委、县长，亲赴灾区检查水情领导泄水。清苑六区区委书记段明琴，亲到各地测量深度观察地形，领导群众在府河堤岸扒泄水口十五处。为了统一思想与行动，沧县、建国、青县等六县均建立了泄水委员会，县与县村与村接合地区，建立了联合指挥部，以“天下农民是一家”、“多救活庄稼少受难”、“小利服从大利”等道理，通过各村党员干部，耐心教育群众，打破了群众任水自流与泄水中的相互隔阂。天津、武清、清苑地势太凹、不能挖泄水沟的地区，就组织群众淘水或用水车拉水。武清大辛庄、黄庄、杨庄、周村等六个村统计，参加淘水群众有一千零九十人，一天淘地七百八十二亩。清苑县委根据各村不同地势，领导群众用不同的方法泄水。沿唐河下游因河水出槽漫流，即领导群众堵挡决口和漫出的支流，再挖沟导水入主流。沿府河的水灾区就领导群众扒开府河堤岸引水入河。武强一县即已泄水脱地十余万亩，河北省人民政府特为此发出关于迅速排水种麦的具体指示，着重指出：各地必须抓紧季节，争取秋分前泄水涸地到百分之八十以上，不能在种麦前排水出者，也须在结冰前争取排出，以备明年早种春麦及其他麦苗。
