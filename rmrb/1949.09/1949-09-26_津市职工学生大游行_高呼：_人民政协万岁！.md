    [Special Dispatch from Our Tianjin Correspondent, 25th] The city of Tianjin was engulfed in a carnival atmosphere all day as municipal enterprise workers, transportation workers, handicraft workers, and Youth League members held a grand parade celebrating the opening of the new People's Political Consultative Conference. More than ten thousand people participated in this great procession. Colorful floats, flower carts, and Yangko dance teams were interspersed throughout the endless line. Three thousand Youth League members shouted slogans celebrating the success of the new People's Political Consultative Conference, resonating through the clear sky. Shop assistants excitedly led the audience in shouting "Long Live the People's Political Consultative Conference!" through loudspeakers. People in the procession readily handed out spare paper flags to children or stuck them on tricycles, allowing this joy belonging to the entire city to be carried to every corner and stratum of the city. In the evening, more than six thousand handicraft workers held a large-scale lantern parade.
