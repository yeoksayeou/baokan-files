　　The Lessons of the Samsung Incident

　　The case of fraud perpetrated by Tianjin Samsung Foreign Trade Firm against the state-owned North China Foreign Trade Company has already been adjudicated by the Tianjin People's Court. The principal offender, Zhao Jiantang, and others have been sanctioned by the people's law. The North China People's Government has also taken appropriate disciplinary action against the trade cadres responsible for this case. The major fraud case of the Samsung Foreign Trade Firm has thus come to an end. What lessons should all our economic workers, especially trade workers, draw from this case?

　　First, the Samsung incident demonstrates that some of our economic workers have adopted a careless and irresponsible attitude towards the property of the people's state. When signing the contract with Samsung, the Foreign Trade Company did not thoroughly investigate Samsung's actual situation, assets, credit, and the history of Zhao Jiantang and others. Relying only on the introduction of individual comrades, they signed a contract with this newly established and utterly untrustworthy speculative merchant, whose sole purpose was to swindle public funds, to purchase over 400 million yuan worth of copper wire, and made the payment without any procedures. When paying, the "certificate" given to the North China Foreign Trade Company by Samsung was not a formal bank letter of credit. However, the Foreign Trade Company was so careless about this so-called "certificate" that they did not even look at it, and paid the money to Samsung Foreign Trade Firm without any guarantee, enabling Samsung to achieve its goal of defrauding a huge amount of state assets. These "oversights" in the work cannot be explained as accidental negligence. It should be recognized that this is a manifestation of a seriously irresponsible attitude of some of our economic workers towards state property and a complete lack of vigilance against speculative merchants. Unfortunately, in our economic work, this intolerable and completely irresponsible work attitude is not only manifested in this one instance, such as the fire accident at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, the fire accident at the Shijiazhuang Peace Hospital, and the sabotage incident at the Pangjiabao Coal Mine in Chahar Province, etc. The nature of the Samsung incident is the same as these cases. Therefore, it is necessary to once again draw the attention of all economic workers and thoroughly correct this irresponsible attitude towards state property.

　　Second, the Samsung incident proves that the inspection work in our trade work is extremely unsound. It proves that the leading organs of trade work have not conscientiously and responsibly checked the implementation of their work. After Samsung defrauded a large amount of money, it speculated in the market, disrupted prices, and deposited a large amount of the defrauded money in many banks and money shops. Samsung Company did not sign any contracts with foreign countries to purchase copper wire, but none of this attracted the attention of our trade authorities. It was not until the People's Bank inspected the money shops that the problem began to be discovered, but it still did not attract enough attention from the Foreign Trade Company. Why are our comrades engaged in market management work so numb? Why is the Foreign Trade Company so trusting of such a speculative merchant? Why are the Industry and Commerce Department of the North China People's Government and the North China Trade Corporation so unaware of such a major issue? This shows that there is a serious phenomenon of bureaucracy in our work. It is precisely because of the existence of this bureaucracy that it hinders us from discovering and correcting errors in our work in a timely manner, thus causing greater losses to state property. The Samsung incident has educated all leading organs of economic work that it is necessary to strengthen inspection work and to discover and correct errors in work without any slackening. Problems like the Samsung incident are happening one after another in various places. Some of them have been discovered by the higher-level government and the public, but many have not yet been discovered by all parties. All leading organs of economic work must learn from the Samsung incident and be highly vigilant.

　　Third, why was the North China Foreign Trade Company so eager to pay the copper wire payment to the Samsung Foreign Trade Firm? Because at that time, prices were starting to rise, and the Foreign Trade Company was eager to pay the paper money to Samsung to avoid suffering losses from price fluctuations. In other words, it was to have Samsung bear this loss. The Foreign Trade Company's approach itself was a speculative behavior. It was precisely because of the existence of this speculative motive that the Foreign Trade Company rushed to pay the money without investigation, which enabled Samsung to take advantage of our gaps and achieve its goal of defrauding a large amount of state property. The Samsung incident has educated all economic workers, especially trade workers, to correct the speculative thinking and purely profit-seeking viewpoints in their business ideas. We must recognize that we are representatives of state-owned enterprises. Our work style must be very upright. The purpose of our work is for the benefit of the people, not to seek illegitimate profits. This is the fundamental difference between us and private capitalism.

### 三星事件的教训

　　三星事件的教训
    天津三星国外贸易行对国营华北对外贸易公司行骗案，已经天津人民法院判决。主犯赵鉴唐等已受到人民法律的制裁。华北人民政府亦对此案中负责的贸易干部，予以应得处分。三星国外贸易行大骗案至此已告一段落。我们全体经济工作者，特别是贸易工作者，应当从这个案件中得到些什么教训呢？
    第一，三星事件说明了我们有些经济工作者，对于人民国家的财产，采取了马虎的不负责任的态度。对外贸易公司，在与三星签订合同时，并没有详细地考察三星实际情况、资产、信用以及赵鉴唐等人的历史，只凭信个别同志的介绍就与这个专门为了骗公家的钱而新成立的毫无信用的投机商人签订了购买价值四亿余元紫铜丝的合同，且未经任何手续，即行付款。付款时，三星公司交给华北对久贸易公司的“证件”，并不是正式的银行信用状，但是对外贸易公司对这个所谓“证明文件”，竟马虎到连看都没有看的程度，在毫无保证的情况下，把货款付给三星国外贸易行，使三星得以达到其骗取巨额的国家资产之目的。以上这些工作中的“过失”，不能解释成为偶然的疏忽，应当认识这是我们某些经济工作者对于国家财产的严重的不负责任的态度，和对投机商人毫无警惕性的表现。很可惜的是，在我们的经济工作中，这种不可容忍的完全不负责任的工作态度，并不是只表现在这一次，例如石景山炼铁厂失火事件，石家庄和平医院失火事件，察哈尔庞家堡矿厂破坏事件等。三星事件的性质和以上这些案件是相同的。因此，就必须再度地引起全体经济工作者的注意，彻底纠正这种对国家财产不负责任的工作态度。
    第二，三星事件证明了我们贸易工作中的检查工作是极不健全的。证明了贸易工作领导机关并没有认真负责地检查自己工作执行的情况。三星在骗取了大量的款项之后，在市场上进行投机，扰乱物价，并把骗得的款项，大批地分存在许多银行钱庄里，三星公司并没有向外国签定任何购买紫铜丝的合同，但是所有这些，并没有引起我们贸易机关的注意。直到人民银行检查行庄的时候，才开始发现了这个问题，但是依然没有引起对外贸易公司足够的注意。为什么我们从事市场管理工作的同志，会麻木到这种程度呢？为什么对外贸易公司对于这样一个投机商人就会如此信任呢？为什么华北人民政府工商部和华北贸易总公司对于这样重大问题，就会毫无所知呢？这说明了在我们的工作中，严重地存在着官僚主义的现象。正因为这种官僚主义的存在，才妨害了我们及时地发现并改正工作中的错误，因而使国家财产受了更大损失。三星事件教育了我们一切经济工作的领导机关，须加强检查工作，必须毫不松懈地去发现与改正工作中的错误。各地象三星事件一样的问题，是在接二连三地发生着。其中有些已经被上级政府和公众所发现，但是有不少尚未被各方所发现。一切经济工作的领导机关，都必须从三星事件得到教训，引起高度警惕。
    第三，为什么华北对外贸易公司急于把紫铜丝货款付与三星国外贸易行呢？因为在当时物价正开始上涨，对外贸易公司急于把纸币付给三星，以免蒙受物价波动的损失，换一句话说，就是要三星担负这种损失。对外贸易公司这样作法，本身就是一种投机行为。正因为有这种投机的动机存在，所以对外贸易公司才不加考察地赶快把货款付出去，才使三星得以乘我之隙，达到他骗取国家大量财产的目的。三星事件教育了全体经济工作者，特别是贸易工作者，必须纠正在经营思想上的投机思想与单纯营利观点。认识我们是国家企业的代表人，我们的工作作风，必须是十分正派的，我们工作的目的，是为了人民的利益，而不是猎取不正当的利润。这是我们与私人资本主义根本不同之点。
