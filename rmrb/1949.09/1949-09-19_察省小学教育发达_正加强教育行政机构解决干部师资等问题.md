　　[This Newspaper reports] Elementary education in Chahar Province has developed rapidly in the past six months. Since the merger of the Beiyue and Ji-Re-Cha areas in February, out of 12,052 administrative villages, 8,045 have primary schools (including 49 in Zhangxuan City), accounting for 67% of the administrative villages. There are 414 higher primary schools and complete primary schools. There are 246,062 children enrolled, accounting for 37% of school-age children. As of the end of July, the number of primary schools has increased to 10,728, reaching 79% of the administrative villages. The number of children enrolled has increased to 625,247, reaching 52% of school-age children. The demand for education is very high among farmers in both newly liberated and old liberated areas. In the past, the leadership, especially at the county and district levels, neglected elementary education. On the one hand, there was a shortage of educational administrative cadres, and the organizational structure was not sound. In Chabei, as of the end of July, except for Zhangbei and Shangdu counties where civil education had just been separated, other counties had not yet separated the departments, and some were headed by administrative secretaries concurrently serving as section chiefs. The Provincial Department of Education has now decided that in the future, in addition to transferring a large number of intellectuals to areas with severe shortages to supplement administrative cadres to strengthen leadership, it will also strengthen supervision through various meetings to adhere to the reporting system, in order to reverse the idea of neglecting education. In addition, the cultural level of elementary school teachers in the old areas of the province is low, and the political level of teachers in the new areas is low. Among the 1,186 primary school teachers in Chabei, 822 have education levels below higher primary school. Many teachers in the new areas have a vague understanding of the Communist Party and the Soviet Union, and lack a clear and firm concept of serving the people. The Provincial Department of Education is now preparing to complete a plan by the end of next year to implement three-month rotational training for all primary school teachers, publish the "Cultural Service" journal, conduct correspondence courses, and formally stipulate that each county should divide central school districts and establish central principals to lead the learning of teachers in the central area. In terms of quantity, the provincial government is determined to send a large number of intellectuals to the countryside in the Chabei area to solve the shortage of educational administrative cadres and teachers. According to current statistics, 271 people have been sent to Chabei, Chanan, Yanbei, and Zhangjiakou during the summer vacation, which has played a significant role.

　　察省小学教育发达
  　正加强教育行政机构解决干部师资等问题
    【本报讯】察哈尔省小学教育半年来获得迅速发展。从二月份北狱区和冀热察地区合并后，一万二千零五十二个行政村中，就有初级小学八千零四十五座（包括张宣市四十九座），占行政村的百分之六十七。高小和完小有四一四座。入学儿童二十四万六千零六十二人，占学龄儿童的百分之三十七。截至七月份止，初小已增至一万零七百二十八座，达到行政村的百分之七十九。入学儿童增至六十二万五千二百四十七人，达到学龄儿童的百分之五十二。高小和完小增至四百五十四座。无论新解放区或老解放区农民对教育的要求都非常高。过去领导上特别是县区领导上对小学教育忽视，一方面教育行政干部短少，组织机构也不健全，察北截至七月份止，除张北、商都两县民教刚分科外，其他县份尚未分科，而且有的是行政秘书兼任科长。现该省教育处已决定今后除大批输送知识分子至奇缺地区补充行政干部以加强领导外，并通过各种会议坚持汇报制度，加强督导，以扭转忽视教育的思想。此外该省小学教师老区的文化水平低，新区的政治水平低。察北初小教员一千一百八十六名中，就有八百二十二名是高小以下程度。新区教员不少对共产党、苏联认识模糊，缺乏明确坚定为人民服务的观念。该省教育处现已准备于明年底完成对所有小学教员实行轮训三个月的计划，一面出版“文化服务”刊物，及进行函授工作，并正式规定各县划中心学区，设中心校长领导该中心区教师的学习。在数量上，对察北地区省府决心输送大批知识分子下乡，解决教育行政干部及师资的缺额。据现在统计，暑期输送到察北、察南、雁北、张家口等地的已有二百七十一名，起了很大的作用。
