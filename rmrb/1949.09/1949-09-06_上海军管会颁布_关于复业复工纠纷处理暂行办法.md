Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, September 5th: The Shanghai Military Control Commission of the Chinese People's Liberation Army promulgated the "Provisional Measures for Handling Resumption of Business and Work Disputes" on August 19th. The full text is as follows:

Article 1: These measures are formulated to resolve labor-capital disputes in the city's resumption of business and work, in order to facilitate the restoration and development of production.

Article 2: All factories and shops that have resumed operations must adhere to the principle of mutual benefit for labor and capital, and the development of production, while taking into account the specific circumstances of each factory, and work together to overcome difficulties, in order to improve labor-capital relations and strengthen labor discipline.

Article 3: For those who have not yet resumed operations or have not fully resumed operations, if there are no major difficulties in production conditions, the capitalists shall not delay the resumption of business and work on any pretext. If it is indeed impossible to overcome the difficulties and cannot start business or must close down or change careers, they must apply to the competent authorities of the Municipal Government for approval.

Article 4: For all factories and shops that, within four months before the liberation of this city, were completely shut down, temporarily shut down, or partially shut down for some reason, and all or part of the staff and workers (hereinafter referred to as employees) have been laid off, the capitalists shall reinstate the employees who were laid off during the above-mentioned period if the business fully resumes. The capitalists must find ways to notify those who have not come to the factory to request reinstatement. However, the employees must report within ten days after receiving the notice or newspaper announcement and go to the factory to work on schedule; otherwise, the capitalists may recruit new employees. If only partial resumption of business is possible after liberation, the capitalists may notify the relevant laid-off employees to resume work according to the needs of the resumption. Other employees who cannot be reinstated should be given priority when production gradually recovers, and no new employees should be hired under the same technical conditions.

Article 5: Employees who have already left the factory and fall under any of the following circumstances shall not be entitled to request reinstatement:

　　(1) Employees who have been dismissed for committing faults or for poor skills shall not be entitled to request reinstatement; if the capitalists have dismissed them on any pretext other than the above reasons, they may apply to the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions for review and resolution.
　　(2) Employees who left the factory on their own for more than two months due to war before the liberation of this city shall not be entitled to request reinstatement; however, they may register with the factory's trade union, and the capitalists shall give priority to employing them when the factory hires new employees.
　　(3) Employees who have left the factory before liberation after completing formal dismissal procedures or receiving dismissal compensation shall not be entitled to request reinstatement; however, they may register with the factory's trade union, and the capitalists shall employ them separately according to technical needs and the order of departure from the factory (those who left the factory later shall be reinstated first, those who left the factory earlier shall be reinstated later, and those who left the factory at the same time shall be determined by drawing lots) .
　　(4) Employees who have other jobs elsewhere shall not apply to the original factory for reinstatement.

Article 6: Unemployed employees who are not eligible for reinstatement may register with the Unemployment Workers' Work Committee of the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions Preparatory Committee or its affiliated trade unions of various industries and factories, and shall not gather in crowds to enter the factory, force reinstatement, or obstruct production.

Article 7: The dismissal and reinstatement methods for temporary workers, contract workers, and seasonal workers shall be temporarily handled in accordance with the conditions stipulated by both parties at the time of employment. If disputes arise over the original regulations, either party may apply to the Labor Bureau for mediation.

Article 8: Capitalists have the right to employ and dismiss employees for the needs of production or work, but capitalists shall not dismiss employees on the pretext of suspicion or because employees participate in trade unions and other political activities. If there is a labor contract for the dismissal of employees by capitalists, it shall be handled in accordance with the provisions of the labor contract; if there is no labor contract, the labor party must be notified one month before the dismissal, and the labor party shall be given some dismissal compensation. The amount of dismissal compensation shall be given in different amounts according to the length of service in the factory, but the minimum shall not be less than one month's actual salary and the maximum shall not exceed three months' actual salary. This limit does not apply to dismissals due to employee negligence.

Article 9: These measures shall be implemented from the date of promulgation.

Article 10: The right to interpret and amend these measures belongs to the Shanghai Military Control Commission during the military control period, and to the Shanghai Municipal People's Government after the end of the military control period.
