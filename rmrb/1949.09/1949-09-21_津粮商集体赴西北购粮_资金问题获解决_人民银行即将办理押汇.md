　　Tianjin Grain Merchants Collectively Go to Northwest to Purchase Grain
  　Funding Problem Resolved
  　People's Bank of China to Process Mortgage Loans Soon
    [Tianjin News] The funding problem for Tianjin's wholesale grain merchants collectively going to the Northwest to purchase grain has been resolved after consultation between the Industry and Commerce Bureau and the Tianjin People's Bank of China. The bank has contacted banks in Zhangjiakou, Datong, Fengzhen and other places, and has decided to process mortgage loans immediately. When grain merchants apply to the bank for mortgage loans, they must mortgage physical objects equivalent to 70% of the loan amount, or a 40% security deposit. This method has been announced at the Wholesale Grain Merchants Association membership meeting a few days ago, and various merchants are organizing collective grain purchasing organizations, in addition to dozens of warehouse companies who are also willing to join.
    Also: At the Wholesale Grain Merchants Association membership meeting a few days ago, the person in charge of the association conveyed the "Labor-Management Relations Handling Methods". Everyone unanimously requested the association to issue the methods to each member for detailed reading and thorough implementation. It was also decided to organize a new trade association.
