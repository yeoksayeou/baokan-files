The revolution overthrew the old society,
The People's Political Consultative Conference changed history.
I was born spinning cotton, farming, and working as a servant for landlords,
Never thought I could become a representative, and have today.

Arriving in Beiping, I saw the Party's red flag,
Flying high in front of Qianmen, Houmen, Tiananmen, and the palaces where emperors used to live;
I visited the Revolutionary University, factories, Beihai,
Zhongnanhai, the Forbidden City, Longevity Hill....

The people's city has a new atmosphere,
Like taking off old clothes and putting on new ones;
More than six hundred representatives are meeting together,
The venue is well decorated, with colorful congratulatory banners
Hanging all over the walls, right in the center is Chairman Mao's portrait,
He seems to be smiling, and I smile in my heart too,
When I think of today, I can't forget the past:

One day, I took my child,
To the landlord Wang Lizhong's house to borrow a spool of thread,
His wife saw us mother and daughter come in,
And hastily covered a basket of fine white flour buns with a pot cloth.
I felt resentment and heartache when I saw it,
I quickly pulled my child home, and cried for a long time.

No matter how small the matter,
You can see how landlords look down on poor people,
From that time on, I vowed not to enter his door,
Until the struggle for liberation, I finally relieved the hatred in my heart.

In the old society, women were really not considered human,
Subjected to the landlord's exploitation, oppression, abuse, and harm...
Those who jumped into wells, hanged themselves, drank lye water, were tortured to death,
It's impossible to tell all of them;
Those who didn't die could not turn over from birth to old age,
Some worried, suffered, and wasted their youth!

Thanks to the good leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao,
Workers, peasants, women, and the oppressed people have all been liberated.
Their bodies thoroughly liberated, their spirits are also lifted,
Women are cadres, representatives,
Speaking for the people, stepping forward,
Doing work as capable and serious as men.

In April, the Women's Congress was a success,
I returned to the county and village to convey and report:
"This time, women truly have status,
We must work harder to farm, build up our families, and support the front lines
To dig up the roots of the landlords and the Kuomintang reactionaries!"

The wheat in the fields had just been harvested,
I was mobilizing women to support the army fighting in Jiangnan,
When a notice came from above—
Calling me to represent the peasants and participate in the New Political Consultative Conference,
The car and train were so fast, it only took two days to get to Beiping.

At that time, the preparatory meeting had already passed,
I regretted arriving late,
I asked to stay and learn to read and study politics,
Study important documents.
An old person's memory is bad, I studied for more than a month,
Look, I can't sign my name well,
I can only read the words in the documents every two or three lines.

Regardless of age,
Everyone must study hard:
Since studying the people's democratic dictatorship,
I truly understood the three enemies and four friends,
Everything is led by the workers, and which classes should be united.

This time, the representatives of the People's Political Consultative Conference,
Come from all over the country,
The Communist Party is like the bright and shining Big Dipper,
So many stars come together to surround it,
Workers, peasants, petty bourgeoisie, national bourgeoisie
Everyone unites like steel, inseparable,
We will definitely eliminate the reactionaries,
And tear apart the skin of the American—that paper tiger!

I speak on behalf of the peasants,
Representing all the peasants of North China to attend,
Tell those reactionaries and imperialists,
The Chinese people are not to be trifled with,
As long as there is the leadership of the Communist Party,
We will definitely transform the old world and turn it into a new world!

Participating in the conference, I truly feel honored,
Watching as the new China is about to be born;
The past suffering is thrown behind us,
Brighten your eyes, beware of those secret agents and poisonous insects!
The revolution must be carried out to the end,
But the road is very long, we must always be vigilant!
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　September 21, 1949, Beiping.

### 人民政协把历史改变！——访问人民政协代表李秀真写成此诗

　　人民政协把历史改变！
    ——访问人民政协代表李秀真写成此诗
    王亚平
　　革命把旧社会推翻，
　　人民政协把历史改变。
　　俺纺花、种地、给地主当佣工出身，
　　想不到能当代表，有了今天。
　　
　　到北平，看到党的红旗，
　　高插在前门、后门、天安门和从前住过皇帝的宫殿；
　　俺参观了革命大学、工厂、北海、
　　中南海、故宫、万寿山……。
　　
　　人民的城市一片新气象，
　　好似脱掉旧衣，换了新衣裳；
　　六百多代表在一起开会，
　　会场打扮得好，各色的贺幛
　　挂满了墙，正中是毛主席的像，
　　他仿佛笑了，俺心里也笑，
　　俺想到今天，就忘不了从前：
　　
　　有一天，俺带着孩子，
　　到地主王立中家借络子，
　　他老婆看俺娘们进来，
　　忙拿一块锅布把一筐细面窝窝遮盖。
　　俺看了恼恨，心酸，
　　忙拉着孩子回家，哭了半天。
　　
　　不管针尖大的事情，
　　都会看出地主瞧不起穷人，
　　从那时，俺发誓不进他的门口，
　　直到斗争翻身，俺才解了心头恨。
　　
　　在旧社会，妇女真不算人，
　　受地主的剥削、压迫、玩弄、坑害……
　　跳井的、上吊的、喝卤水死的、被折磨死的，
　　说也说不尽；
　　不死的，从生到老难翻身，
　　有的上愁、受苦、断送了青春！
　　
　　多亏党中央、毛主席领导好，
　　工、农、妇女、被压迫的人民都翻身。
　　身翻的透，人也精神，
　　妇女当干部、当代表，
　　替人民说话，出头出面，
　　办工作跟男的一样能干又认真。
　　
　　四月，妇代大会开的好，
　　俺回到县、村，作传达、报告：
　　“这一回妇女真有了地位，
　　咱得加劲种地、发家、支援前线
　　把地主、国民党反动派底根子挖掉！”
　　
　　地里的麦子刚刚割完，
　　俺正动员妇女，支援大军打江南，
　　上边来了通知——
　　叫俺代表农民，参加新政协，
　　汽车、火车真快，到北平只走了两天。
　　
　　那时候，筹备会开过了，
　　俺后悔来的晚，
　　要求留下来，学认字、学政治、
　　学习重要的文件。
　　人老记性坏，学了一个多月，
　　你看，俺签名签不好，
　　文件的字只能隔二跳三的看看。
　　
　　不管年纪大、年纪轻，
　　人都得好好地学习：
　　自从学习了人民民主专政，
　　俺才真明白了三个敌人、四个朋友，
　　一切由工人领导，该团结那些阶级。
　　
　　这回人民政协的代表，
　　都来自天南海北，
　　共产党象大明大亮的北斗星，
　　多少颗星星都来围在一起，
　　工人、农民、小资产阶级、民族资产阶级
　　大家伙团结成钢铁不分个，
　　一定能消灭反动派，
　　还能撕碎美国——那个纸老虎皮！
　　
　　俺代表农民说话，
　　代表全华北的农民出席，
　　告诉那些反动派、帝国主义，
　　中国的人民是不好惹的，
　　只要有共产党的领导，
　　就一定能改造旧天地、变成新天地！
　　
　　参加大会，俺真感到光荣，
　　眼看着新中国就要产生；
　　从前的痛苦，扔到背后，
　　把眼睛擦亮，防备那些特务、毒虫！
　　革命要革到底，
　　可是，这路子很长，咱得随时多加警惕！
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　一九四九、九、廿一日，北平。
