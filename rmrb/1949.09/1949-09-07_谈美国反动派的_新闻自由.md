　　On the American Reactionaries' "Freedom of the Press"
　　Duan Liancheng

　　In the American reactionaries' self-promotion, "freedom of the press" is one of their most frequently peddled panaceas. For example, in the recently published White Paper on China, Acheson said in the preface: "The inherent strength of our system is the responsiveness of the government to enlightened and critical public opinion." Tearing off the plaster and taking a close look at the inside story of this "enlightened and critical public opinion," even if the likes of Goebbels, the Nazi news ruler, were resurrected, they would surely feel inferior. Because the Nazis used a political iron fist to cover people's mouths to control public opinion in those years. Today's American capitalist reactionary group, however, hides behind the scenes and uses a thin economic thread that is not easy to see to tie the throat of the public opinion circles, the effect is greater, and the method is much more clever.

　　Originally, in a capitalist society, true freedom of the press belonging to the masses of the people is inherently impossible. What is discussed here is that even a little limited freedom that originally existed is also rapidly being reduced and eliminated in today's increasingly fascist America. In the United States, there are many pamphlets and thick books discussing or touting "freedom of the press." The general essence is nothing more than three points: first, it is said that under their "democratic system," anyone who wants to publish newspapers and periodicals does not need to obtain the permission of the government, any political party, or group; second, it is said that all newspapers and periodicals have the freedom to collect, transmit, and publish any news and opinions without prior restrictions or censorship; third, it is said that after all news and opinions are published, except for those who violate certain general laws (such as defamation laws, postal regulations, etc.), the government cannot impose sanctions on the publishers. True freedom of the press belonging to the masses of the people cannot be defined by these three points. This is just the American rulers' interpretation of their set of "freedom of the press." Judging them one by one according to their statements, this "freedom of the press" plaster is still fake.

　　First of all, can any John or Mary on the street publish newspapers and periodicals and say what they want to say in their hearts? For example, the best-selling newspaper in the United States is a small "New York Daily News," with a daily circulation of about 2.5 million copies, and about 4.75 million copies on Sundays. The construction cost of the newspaper's office in New York alone was 10 million US dollars. The interview department has five airplanes, the distribution department has more than 100 cars, and there are more than 50 photographers alone. Other newspapers in big cities are also very large enterprises. Imagine how a commoner who earns thirty or forty dollars a week could dream of running a newspaper! Even small capitalists who earn tens of thousands a month should not talk about publishing periodicals. Thus, the freedom of press publication of "no need to obtain permission from the government, any political party, or group" has become the unlimited publication freedom of capitalists, a freedom that common people can only hope for but cannot reach.

　　Of course, it is possible to run smaller newspapers and periodicals in small cities or towns. However, many local newspapers have already been bought by news trusts such as the "Howard Chain," making it difficult to compete with them. Even if they are published, the source of telegrams is only a few such as the Associated Press, the United Press, and the International News Service; the photos are only a few such as Acme and the Associated Press; even the feature supplements are contracted by organizations such as the King Features Syndicate. And these sources are all large enterprises and large monopolies, of course, they are the mouthpieces of capitalists. The scope of activities left to the small newspapers themselves is only local news such as Mary giving birth and Tom marrying a wife. Therefore, saying that everyone has freedom of press publication is selling fake plaster.

　　Secondly, is there really no censorship before news and opinions are published? Last summer, a young reporter covering education news for the Washington Post, who was a Communist, performed very well at work. At that time, the election news of the Republican and Democratic parties often occupied the headlines. This young man wrote a few more paragraphs about the activities of Wallace's student groups. That's right, there is no need to send it to anyone for inspection in advance, but the editor did not publish it. A few days later, the boss called the reporter for a talk, first praising him for his hard work, and then saying: "You believe in communism, I believe in capitalism, please leave." Then, the labor union controlled by the capitalists passed a resolution, scolding the young reporter and canceling his membership. This is a representative example. In today's America, the news industry itself has generally developed into a large enterprise, and most of the bosses are important figures in the reactionary capitalist group. For example, the New York Daily News mentioned earlier was founded by Joseph Patterson. His cousin Robert R. McCormick is the publisher of the Chicago Tribune, the largest in the Midwest, and has always been a leading figure in the most reactionary isolationist. At the same time, the Times-Herald, the largest newspaper in Washington, D.C., is also the property of their family's Elinore Patterson (Note: Recently it has been sold). Another example is Henry Luce, a major accomplice of the Kuomintang reactionaries, who single-handedly controls the widely circulated "Time" and "Life" magazines, and another "Fortune." In this situation where the news industry is completely owned by large capitalists, ordinary reporters and writers, for the sake of their jobs, must carefully examine themselves before writing a single word; editors must also carefully examine themselves before publishing a topic or article. Reasoning from this meaning, saying that the American news industry is not subject to inspection is also fake plaster.

　　Finally, and most importantly, is the sanction after the publication of news and opinions. That's right, if you attack the government, the government will not come to seal it up, if you offend the group, the group will not come to beat the newspaper office. But if you offend the capitalists, they can make you close down quickly. How do you say this? For example, the New York Times is considered the most authoritative newspaper in the United States, publishing five or sixty pages every day, and even hundreds of pages on Sundays, a thick bundle. The wholesale price of newsprint alone is one dime (US coin) per copy, but on the newsstand, the Times only sells for three cents. Where does the money come from? From advertising. Who can afford to advertise? Large trusts and various small enterprises directly affiliated with or controlled by them. Suppose the Times supports Wallace, the big capitalists will of course be furious, and the board of directors of the trust will issue an order not to advertise in the Times. Then this "authoritative newspaper" will soon go bankrupt, and the court will naturally come to seal it up. In the total income of general newspapers in the United States, advertising fees account for an average of two-thirds and distribution accounts for one-third. In the few years after 1930, advertising was as high as three-quarters. The capitalist group's control over the news industry can be seen from this figure.

　　Another example: Jewish capitalist Marshall Field, dissatisfied with the undercurrent of anti-Semitism in the United States, founded an "Afternoon Newspaper" in New York. This newspaper is basically reactionary, occasionally saying a few words dissatisfied with the status quo. There is little advertising, and it has been losing money. If Field had not had money to subsidize it, it would have closed down long ago. Last summer, it finally couldn't support it and sold it, renamed the New York Star. The capitalists did not forget the past, and still did not patronize it, and it also closed down in a few months. Therefore, saying that the American news industry is not subject to any sanctions other than the law is even more fake plaster.

　　As for broadcasting and the developing television industry, the situation of being controlled is basically the same as that of newspapers. The four major companies (Columbia - CBS, National Company - NBC, American Company - ABC, Mutual Company - MBS) are the main sources of all programs. The four companies themselves are extremely large enterprises, privately owned by some important figures on Wall Street. Non-capitalists cannot afford to run radio stations, and even if they do, they have to use their programs. Most of the commentators are supported by large companies. For example, Winchell, who earns more than 500,000 US dollars a year, is advertising for Kaiser Motor Company; Pearson, who has a wide audience, is employed by Lee Hat Company.

　　What is discussed above is the reactionary capitalist group's control over the news industry in a positive aspect. In a negative aspect, they are using the news industry to paralyze the thinking of the masses of the people. Newspapers are filled with yellow news, sports news, and meaningless comic strips; the most on the radio are detective stories and lottery-style prize-giving programs.

　　The famous Soviet journalist Ehrenburg was invited to the United States for investigation. The bosses of newspaper and broadcasting industries, full of the idea that exquisite printing, rapid transmission and other technical advantages can fool people; that set of superficial "freedom of the press" can deceive people. Ehrenburg had a very detailed criticism of the American news industry. I have not seen the original manuscript and cannot quote it. According to "Time" magazine, Ehrenburg believed that American newspapers are mostly "rubbish." If Ehrenburg said this, it is not an exaggeration. Because even if the fake plaster is made well, the awakened masses of the people will not believe it.

　　谈美国反动派的“新闻自由”
    段连城
    在美国反动派的自我宣传中，“新闻自由”是他们最常卖的一张膏药。譬如新近发表的对华白皮书，艾奇逊在序言里便说：“我们制度的固有力量，是政府对于有识见又如批评的舆论之感应性”。拆开膏药皮，细看这“有识见又好批评的舆论”的内幕，假如纳粹新闻统治者哥培尔之流复活，也定会自愧不如。因为纳粹当年的控制舆论是用一只政治铁手，遮住人的嘴巴。而今天的美国资本家反动集团，却是藏在幕后，用一条不易看见的经济细线，拴住舆论界的咽喉，效果更大，而手法是高明多了。
    本来在资本主义的社会里，真正的属于人民大众的新闻自由，先天上已经决定，不可能存在。这里所谈的，是原有的一点有限的自由，在美国统治者逐渐法西斯化的今天，也迅速地被缩减消灭。在美国，讨论或吹嘘“新闻自由”的小册子及厚书本，数目很多。综合要义，不外三点：第一是说在他们的“民主制度”下，任何人要出版报纸刊物，不必要得到政府、任何政党或集团的允许；第二是说一切报刊，有收集、传递及发表任何消息言论的自由，事前不受限制检查；第三是说一切消息言论发表之后，除违反某些普遍法律者外（如毁谤法、邮政法规等），政府不能对发表者加以制裁。真正的属于人民大众的新闻自由，并不能用这三点来作定义。这只是美国统治者对他们那一套“新闻自由”的解释。就依他们的说法逐条来评断罢，这一张“新闻自由”膏药，还是假的。
    首先，是否满街的约翰或玛莉，都可以出版报纸刊物，说自己心里想说的话？举例来说，美国销路最大的报，是一张小型的“纽约每日新闻”，平日发行约二百五十万份，礼拜天约四百七十五万份。这报在纽约的社址，建筑费便花了一千万美元。采访部备有飞机五架，发行部有汽车一百多辆，单摄影记者，就有五十多人。其他在大城市的报纸，也都是很庞大的企业。试想每周挣三四十元的小民，那能梦想办报纸！就是每月赚几万的小资本家，也别侈谈出刊物。于是“不需要得到政府，任何政党或集团允许”的新闻出版自由，便成了资本家们无限制的出版自由，小民们可望而不可及的自由了。
    当然，办规模较小的报刊，可以到小城或村镇去。无如许多小地方的报纸，早已被“霍华德系”一类的新闻托辣斯买下，很难与之竞争。就算是办出来，电稿来源只有联合社、合众社、国际新闻社等数家；照片只有爱克米、联合社等几个；连特写副刊，都被金士文联一类的组织包办。而这些来源，又都是大企业，大独占，当然是资本家的喉舌。留给小报本身的活动余地，只有玛莉生孩子，汤姆讨老婆一类的本地新闻了。所以说人人都有新闻出版自由，是卖假膏药。
    其次，是消息言论发表以前，真的不受任何检查吗？去年夏天，华盛顿邮报一个年轻的跑教育消息的记者，是一个共产党员，工作表现很好。那时候，共和民主二党的竞选消息，常占头条。这位年轻人多写了几段华莱士派学生活动的消息。不错，事前不要送给任何人检查，但是编辑先生却没有登。过几天，老板找这位记者去问话，首先盛赞他工作起劲，然后说：“你相信共产主义，我相信资本主义，请你走路”。接着，资方把持的新闻从业员工会，通过一个决议，大骂这年轻记者一通，取消他的会籍。这是一个有代表性的例子。在今天的美国，新闻事业本身，一般都已发展为大企业，老板们多数是反动资本家集团的要角。譬如刚才提到的纽约每日新闻，是由约瑟·伯德逊创办的。他的堂兄罗勃·麦考密便是中西部规模最大的支加哥论坛报的发行人，一直是最反动的孤立派领导人物。同时，美京华盛顿最大的报纸时代前锋报，又是他们一家的伊利娜·伯德逊的产业（注：最近已转手）。再如国民党反动派的大帮凶亨利·鲁斯，一手便掌握了销行极广的“时代”、“生活”两大杂志，另外还有一个“幸福”。在这种新闻事业完全为大资本家主有的情形下，一般记者作家，为了饭碗，在写一字一句之前，得自己好好检查；编辑先生们，在发一题一文之先，也得谨慎检查。从这一个意义上推论，说美国新闻事业不受检查，也是假膏药。
    最后，也是最要紧的一点，就是消息言论发表后的制裁。不错，攻击了政府，政府不会来贴封条，得罪了集团，集团不会来打报馆。但若开罪了资本家，他们却能让你很快关门大吉。此话怎讲？譬如纽约时报，算是美国最有权威的报纸，每天出版五六十页不等，礼拜天更是几百页，厚厚一大束。只白报纸，每份批发价便合美金一角，而在报摊上，时报却只卖三分。钱从那里赚呢？靠广告。谁登得起广告呢？大托辣斯及其所直属或控制的各种小企业。假想时报支持华莱士，大资本家们当然光火，托辣斯的董事会下一纸命令，不在时报登广告。那末这“权威报纸”，很快便会破产，法庭自然来贴封条。在美国一般报纸的总收入中，广告费平均占三分之二，发行三分之一。在一九三○后几年，广告高达四分之三。资本家集团对新闻事业的控制力量，由这数字中便可概见。
    另一个例：犹太籍资本家马歇尔·费尔德，因为不满美国的排犹暗潮，在纽约办了一个“下午报”。这报基本上是反动的，间或说几句不满现状的话。广告少，一直赔本。若不是费氏有钱贴，老早已经关门。到了去夏，终于撑持不住而出顶，改做纽约星报。资本家们未忘前嫌，依然不光顾，过不了几个月，也关了门。因此说美国新闻事业不受任何法律以外的制裁，更是假膏药。
    至于广播及正在发展中的电视事业，被控制的情形，基本上和报纸完全相同。四大公司（哥伦比亚——ＣＢＳ，国家公司——ＮＢＣ，美国公司—ＡＢＣ，相互公司—ＭＢＳ），是一切节目的主要来源。四家本身都是极庞大的企业，为华尔街的一些要角所私有。非资本家办不起电台，就算办起来也得用他们的节目。多数的评论家都是由大公司豢养。如象每年支薪五十余万美元的温歇尔，正替凯塞汽车公司做广告；听众极广的皮尔逊，是受雇于李氏制帽公司。
    上面谈的，是反动资本家集团对新闻事业积极方面的控制。消极方面，他们正利用新闻事业，对人民大众的思想，加以麻醉。新闻纸充满了黄色消息，运动新闻及毫无意义的连环图画；广播里最多的是侦探故事，买彩票式的给奖节目。
    苏联名记者爱伦堡氏，曾被邀请到美国考察。报社及广播事业的老板们，满以为印刷精良，传递迅速等技术优点，可以＠人；那一套表面的“新闻自由”，可以骗人。爱氏对美国新闻事业，曾有很详尽的批评。没有看到原稿，不能引证。据“时代”杂志说，爱氏认为美国报纸，多是“废料”。果然爱伦堡说过这话，也不算过火。因为假膏药对得虽好，觉醒了的人民大众，是不会相信的。
