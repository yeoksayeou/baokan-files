　　Improve Technology, Reduce Costs
  　Municipal Factory and Mine Engineers Symposium
    Unanimously Agreeing on the Need to Rely on Workers, Closely Contact Purchasing Personnel, and Pay Attention to Market Conditions.
    [This City News] The Beijing Municipal People's Government Enterprise Bureau convened a symposium yesterday (16th) for engineers from its affiliated factories and mines to exchange ideas on technological transformation and cost reduction. More than 60 technical personnel attended. The speeches at the meeting were very enthusiastic. Especially Comrade Dong, the director of the New Construction Glass Factory, said that in the past three months, the technology of the glass factory has progressed faster than in the two years under the Kuomintang, showing that only after liberation can technical personnel have a place to use their talents.
    Regarding how to improve technology and carry out the production and frugality movement, everyone believed that the first thing to do is to rely on the workers. Liu Xigong, a technician from Yanjing Paper Mill, said: "The power of the workers is infinite. How to improve the relationship between technicians and workers is the most important issue." Lin Dong, a technician from the New Construction Pharmaceutical Factory, said: "Technicians should help workers improve their technology and unleash their creativity." He cited an example: "In the old liberated areas, when making calcium iodide, the workers imitated the method of farmers grinding flour, and made a Luo-style foot-operated vibrator to replace hand-cranking, which could shake many bottles at once." Liu Zhenfu, manager of the Waterworks Company, said: "Recently, workers used lead pipe ends to make a small lead melting furnace with bellows, which uses only 15 kilograms of coke and 1 kilogram of firewood to melt 150 kilograms of lead, while in the past, melting the same amount of lead required 50 kilograms of coke and 10 kilograms of firewood. Therefore, technical personnel should help workers learn, enable them to understand drawings and draw pictures, and understand principles, so that they can give full play to their creativity."
    Secondly, everyone believed that technical personnel must establish close contact with purchasing personnel. Chen Diwu, an engineer from Xishan Coal Mine, said that because they did not pay enough attention to this aspect, they originally planned to buy six-inch steel ropes, but the purchasing staff bought iron ropes, which could not be used. However, the Waterworks Company established a purchasing committee temporarily when purchasing a large batch of materials in July, including engineers and technical personnel, and the effect was very good.
    In addition, everyone also pointed out that technical personnel should pay attention to market conditions so that production can meet the needs. They should visit other factories, study the latest magazines and literature, and contact relevant factories and agencies in other places to improve technology. When making plans, technical personnel should pay attention to combining them with actual conditions, so as not to make the plans fail. The general problems existing in the technical aspects of various factories are to add machinery and equipment, repair factory buildings, and search for materials. In addition, Wang Zihou, deputy engineer of the Tram Company, said that the government should set certain specifications and standards for certain items in the future. Now, to tighten a screw nut, because there are many styles and the screw caps are different sizes, workers need to use six kinds of "wrenches" to tighten them, which is a waste of manpower.
    Director Mou Zexian finally concluded that in order to overcome the many difficulties that exist now and transform Beiping from a consumer city into a productive city, engineers must play a major role. Everyone should pay attention to combining with workers, disclose their technology, rely on workers, help workers, and complete the task of construction. For the existing problems in the factory, everyone can make plans for solutions, as long as they are beneficial to the people and necessary, they must find ways to solve them. Deputy Director Jia Tingsan said: The Enterprise Bureau has notified all factories that technical work meetings should be held regularly in the future to specifically study improving technology and improving quality. The Enterprise Bureau will also hold symposiums for technical personnel in groups according to the nature of their work to further exchange opinions.

　　提高技术减低成本
  　市属厂矿工程师座谈
    一致认为须依靠工人，密切联系采购人员，注意市场情况。
    【本市讯】北平市人民政府企业局，昨（十六）日召集所属各厂矿工程师举行座谈会，交换改造技术、减低成本的意见。出席技术人员六十余人。会上发言很踊跃。新建玻璃厂尤其侗厂长说，三个月来，玻璃厂的技术，比国民党时期两年间的进步都快，可见只有解放后，技术人员才有了用武之地。
    关于如何提高技术与开展生产节约运动问题，大家认为首先应依靠工人。燕京造纸厂刘锡功技师说：“工人的力量无限大，如何搞好技师和工人的关系，是最重要的问题。”新建制药厂林栋技师说：“技师们应帮助工人，提高他们的技术，发挥他们的创造力。”他举例说：“以前在老解放区作碘化钙时，工人们仿照农民罗面的方法，作出罗式脚蹬振荡器代替手摇，一次可摇许多瓶。”自来水公司刘珍甫经理说：“最近工人们用铅管头子做出带风箱的小化铅炉，化一百五十公斤铅，只用十五公斤焦炭、一公斤木柴，而以前化同样的铅则用五十公斤焦炭与十公斤木柴。因之技术人员应帮助工人学习，使他们懂得看图画图，明白原理，使他们高度发挥创造力。”
    其次，大家认为技术人员必须与采购人员取得密切联系。西山煤矿陈迪武工程师说，他们因在这方面注意不够，原计划要买六英寸的纲绳，采购员买来的都是铁绳，结果用不得。而自来水公司在七月购买一大批物料时，临时成立了一个采购委员会，其中包括工程师和技术人员，效果很好。
    此外，大家还指出，技术人员应注意市场情况，以便生产能合乎需要。应到其他工厂参观，和学习最新杂志文献，并与外地有关工厂机关联系，以改进技术。技术人员在作计划时，应注意结合实际情况，才不致使作出来的计划落空。关于各工厂技术方面存在的问题，一般的是要增添机器设备，修补厂房，搜寻物料。此外，电车公司王子厚副工程师说，政府将来对某些物品，应定出一定的规格和标准。现在要上一个螺丝母，因样式多，螺丝帽大小不一，工人需用六种“搬子”才能上上，实在浪费人力。
    牟泽衔局长最后总结说，要克服目前存在的许多困难，把北平从一个消费城市变为生产城市，工程师们要起很大的作用。大家应注意与工人结合，公开自己的技术，依靠工人，帮助工人，完成建设的任务。对于工厂里现存的问题，大家可作出解决的计划，只要与人民有利，而且是必需的，一定想办法解决。贾庭三副局长说：企业局已通知各厂，今后应经常召开技术工作会议，专门研究改进技术，提高质量。企业局也将按工作性质分组召开技术人员座谈会，进一步的交换意见。
