　　Implementation of Fire Prevention Inspections Well-Received by Policyholders
    [This Newspaper] North Ping China Insurance Company's business continued to develop in August, with significant increases in both policyholders and the amount of insurance underwritten. The company's August business was able to continue to develop due to its coordination with bank lending and warehousing operations. During this month, a total of 72 policies were underwritten for fire insurance and transportation insurance (including 45 direct fire insurance policies, 4 railway transportation insurance policies, 16 fire insurance reinsurance policies, and 7 transportation insurance policies), an increase of 50% compared to the 48 policies in July. The total amount of insurance underwritten in August was 463.76 million yuan (including 385.96 million yuan for direct fire insurance, 26.0309 million yuan for transportation insurance, 36.17 million yuan for fire insurance reinsurance, and 15.6 million yuan for transportation insurance reinsurance), an increase of more than 271% compared to the total amount of 124.76 million yuan in July.
    In addition, in order to emphasize proactive fire prevention, the company conducted inspections of fire-fighting equipment for various policyholders in August. Over the course of a week, a total of 48 households were inspected. The inspection results showed that four companies, including Zhongyuan Company, had complete fire-fighting equipment and tight organization; 24 companies, including Wuzhou Pharmacy, had incomplete equipment and lacked organization; and the remaining 20 companies, such as China Toothbrush Factory, had simple equipment or no preparation at all. The feedback received during this inspection was positive. The inspected manufacturers offered suggestions, recommending that such inspections be conducted regularly, that the inspection of electrical wiring should be the responsibility of personnel designated by the insurance company, that the manufacture of fire extinguishers should be supervised by state-owned, public-private partnership, or insurance companies, and that private businesses must be approved by the competent authorities and tested regularly to maintain the quality of their products.
