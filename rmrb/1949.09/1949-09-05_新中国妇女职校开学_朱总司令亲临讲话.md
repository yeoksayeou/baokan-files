　　New China Women's Vocational School Opens
  　Commander-in-Chief Zhu De Attends and Speaks
    [This Municipality News] The New China Women's Vocational School, since being taken over by the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, after half a month of rectification, held its opening ceremony at 9:00 AM on the 2nd. Commander-in-Chief Zhu De, along with Vice-Chairman of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation Li Dequan, Secretary-General Qu Mengjue, and Production Minister Zhang Qinqiu, all attended and spoke. Principal Liu Qingyang presided. After she explained that this was a new day for all teachers and students, with great significance, Commander-in-Chief Zhu De, amidst enthusiastic applause, gave an impromptu speech. He encouraged everyone that in establishing a new Beiping, transforming a consumer city into a production city, it is imperative to learn before doing to do well and continue doing, learn until old age, eliminate aristocratic thinking, integrate with the masses, study diligently and wholeheartedly, study for the service of society, and combine with practical work. This is just the beginning. Vice-Chairman Li Dequan, from the reactionary political involvement of the Kuomintang, explained the contempt and oppression women suffered at that time. She also introduced the agriculturalist Shen Liying, who researched and improved wheat seeds, who went to the countryside barefoot during the day and worked in the chemical laboratory at night, ultimately dying at her post. Now that Beiping is liberated, the Hebei Women's Vocational School has been taken over by the All-China Women's Federation. The young sisters, after training, under the leadership of the working class proletariat, will contribute their sacred labor power to the people of the whole country, establish the concept of the sanctity of labor, and work with a down-to-earth attitude, laying a solid foundation to serve the people. Qu Mengjue, Secretary-General of the All-China Women's Federation, introduced that the All-China Democratic Women's Federation is a national women's movement leadership organization born from a broad mass base. The representative conference was held on March 24th this year, which is the first time in the history of the Chinese women's movement, representing the great unity of all Chinese women, accelerating production, and building a new China, which is the future direction of the women's movement.
    Zhang Qinqiu, Production Minister of the All-China Women's Federation, was inspired by the new atmosphere in the school. She hoped that this new atmosphere would play a significant role in the task of building a new Beiping after one year, mastering specialized skills, and better serving the people. In the Soviet Union and various New Democratic countries, women participate in all work positions and have played a significant role in social construction, and women have a definite place when they leave their homes. However, the number of Chinese women participating in work is not large. Please serve the people in various work positions in cities and villages after graduation. In terms of teaching methods, try to inspire wisdom and combine it with practical work, so that what is learned is consistent with what is used, and theory is combined with practice. The graduates of the previous term worried about not finding a job, but now it is different. Men and women are equal, and construction work requires a large number of talents. As long as you learn well, you will be welcomed everywhere.
    Representatives of teachers and students spoke separately, expressing their gratitude for the instructions of Commander-in-Chief Zhu De and the big sisters of the Democratic Women's Federation, sincerely accepting them, and wholeheartedly serving the people. The opening ceremony adjourned in enthusiastic and joyful encouragement.

    【本市讯】新中国妇女职业学校自全国民主妇联接办以来，经过半月整顿，已于二日上午九时举行开学典礼。朱总司令和全国民主妇联副主席李德全、秘书长区梦觉、生产部长张琴秋等均出席讲话。校长刘清扬主席。她说明这是全校师生新生的一天，意义非常重大之后，朱总司令在一阵热烈掌声中即席讲话，勉励大家在建立新北平把消费城变为生产城的原则下，势必先学而后作才能作得好，作到老，学到老，去掉贵族思想，必须与群众结合，安心学，努力学，为社会服务而学，与实际工作结合起来，现在只是个开始。李德全副主席从国民党反动从政说明了妇女在当时所受的轻视与压迫，并介绍研究改良小麦种子的农业家沈骊英女士，她白天光着脚下乡，晚上在化学实验室工作，终于死在她的工作岗位上。现在北平解放了，河北女职由全国妇联接办，小妹妹们经过训练，在工人无产阶级领导下，把神圣的劳动力量贡献给全国人民、树立劳动神圣的观念，脚踏实地去作，奠定了稳固的基础，为人民服务。全国妇联秘书长区梦觉介绍全国民主妇联是由于广大群众基础而产生的全国性的妇女运动领导机构，今年三月二十四日召开代表大会，这在中国妇女运动史上是第一次，代表了全中国妇女的大团结，加紧生产，建设新中国，是今后妇女运动的方针。
    全国妇联生产部长张琴秋对于学校中的新气象引起了她的感想，她希望这新气象在一年之后，在建设新北平的任务中，能起了很大的作用，掌握了专门技能，好为人民服务。苏联及各新民主主义国家的各个工作岗位中，均有妇女参加，对于社会建设都起了很大的作用，妇女走出家庭都有其一定地位。但是中国妇女参加工作的人数并不多，务请你们学成之后，到在城市、乡村各个工作岗位上为人民服务，教学法方面，尽量启发智慧与实际工作结合，使所学合于所用，理论与实践结合。上期毕业同学发愁找不到工作，现在不同了，男女平等了，而且建设工作需要大批人材，只要学得好，到处均受欢迎。
    教职员代表与学生代表均分别讲话，对于朱总司令和民主妇联大姊姊们的指示，表示感谢，诚恳的接受，全心全意为人民服务。开学典礼在热烈欢欣鼓舞中散会。
