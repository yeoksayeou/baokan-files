A History of American Aggression Against China
    Liu Danian

  　Two. Gradually Moving Towards Independent Aggression Against China (Continued from XII)

    On May 9th, when Japan presented Yuan Shikai with the final ultimatum, the U.S. State Department quickly issued an identical note to both China and Japan on the 15th of the same month, solemnly declaring:

    "The Government of the United States hereby declares that any clauses in the treaty currently under negotiation which are recognized by the Chinese government and which alter the status of foreigners in China, the Government of the United States shall also enjoy the benefits thereof under the most-favored-nation treatment." (Note: Ibid., p. 331.)

    The United States thus obtained the price for cooperating with Japan. Based on the effect of this statement, the United States not only completely avoided Japan's attacks but also further utilized Japan's demands to extract identical benefits from the Chinese people.

    After a period of feigned resistance, Yuan Shikai accepted all of the demands from both Japan and the United States. This strengthened his counter-revolutionary and anti-people confidence, and he resolved to become "Emperor." After completing the traitorous negotiations in May 1915, the "Preparatory Society for Peace" appeared in August. Japan, on the one hand, had "hoped for the high promotion of Your Excellency the President" when presenting the Twenty-One Demands, and on the other hand, supported the Yunnan Uprising against Yuan Shikai. The United States, on the other hand, gave 100% support to Yuan Shikai's imperial ambitions, providing him with large loans, including three direct loans totaling 136 million (?), in addition to other loans earmarked for different purposes but serving the same goal, such as dredging canals, revitalizing industry, restructuring the economy, and constructing railways, totaling another 33 million. Most of these loans were made after the anti-imperial movement broke out; some were even suspended after Yuan died shortly after receiving a portion of the payment, "in view of the unrest in China." (Note: See Xu Zhiyan, ed., "Chronicle of the Tenth Anniversary of the Republic of China," Vol. 2; "The Diplomatic Review," Vol. 5, No. 1; "The Eastern Miscellany," Vol. 13, No. 11). The American Goodnow, in his capacity as Yuan Shikai's "constitutional advisor," published a famous essay on monarchy versus republic, arguing that there was no doubt that it would be better for China to switch to a monarchy than to remain a republic, on the grounds that "a country with low levels of popular intelligence! Where the people are not usually involved in politics and have absolutely no political wisdom (!), then a republic will surely lead to bad results... Otherwise, foreign intervention may be unavoidable." (Note: Goodnow, "Republic and Monarchy," The Eastern Miscellany, Vol. 12, No. 10.) This famous "theory" and the large loans both encouraged Yuan Shikai and intimidated the people who opposed him. Although Yuan Shikai relied on this foreign aid to become emperor, he quickly fell into the grave under the blows of the Chinese people.

    Yuan Shikai's death deprived the American and Japanese aggressors of a central figure who could continue to serve as their general tool. Japan quickly took advantage of Duan Qirui, of the "Orthodox Beiyang" faction. The United States targeted Li Yuanhong, who inherited the presidency. For a short time, the struggle between the United States and Japan in China was again manifested as the struggle between Li Yuanhong and Duan Qirui. Zhang Xun's "restoration" and China's entry into World War I were all products of this struggle.

    Shortly after the war began, Japan, using Germany's occupation of Qingdao as a pretext, launched a campaign to capture Shandong. The United States immediately encouraged Yuan Shikai to propose limiting the war zone to Japan, which was strongly opposed by Japan (Note: Archives of the Japanese Embassy, telegram from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to Lu Zongyu, quoted in Wang Yunsheng's book, Vol. 6, p. 47). Later, Britain, France, and others also indicated that China should join the war, but Japan continued to obstruct it in every way, fearing that China's participation in the war would interfere with its aggression by involving it in international activities. The United States seized the opportunity to make a lot of money from arms sales, and did not announce its entry into this bandit war until February 1917, and notified the Beijing government that "if other neutral countries could imitate the actions of the U.S. government, it would benefit world peace" (Note: February 4, 1917, Note from the U.S. Minister to Beijing to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs), hoping to involve the Chinese people in this massacre, so that the reactionary rulers of China could obtain the right to speak after the war as a price for helping the United States to resist Japan. Although this was completely opposite to Japan's approach in practice, the motive was exactly the same. But at this time, the situation in Japan had changed. It had obtained the special interests of the Twenty-One Demands in 1915, and established a secret understanding with Britain, France, Italy, and Russia in February and March 1917, with the four countries helping Japan illegally obtain rights in Shandong, and Japan taking the pressure to have China declare war on Germany as an exchange condition, so when the United States made the above request to China, Japan fully agreed. At this time, Duan Qirui was the "Prime Minister" under Li Yuanhong, and he seized this opportunity to obtain Japanese assistance to eliminate dissidents and consolidate the Beiyang forces, sparing no effort to "participate in the war." The United States then realized that China's entry into the war was only being used by Japan, so it turned around and advocated that China should not declare war on Germany for the time being, so as not to cause foreign disputes that the United States could not help resolve (Note: Zhang Zhongfu: Diplomacy of China's Participation in the War in the Sixth Year of the Republic, "The Eastern Miscellany," Vol. 23, No. 1). In March 1917, when Duan Qirui drafted a telegram ordering the Minister to Japan, Zhang Zongxiang, to secretly notify the Japanese government on the issue of severing diplomatic relations with Germany, Li Yuanhong refused to sign and seal it, resulting in the so-called "struggle between the government and the court (the Presidential Palace and the State Council)." Duan Qirui used petitions from the "Citizen Corps," discussions in "Congress," and other methods, but without definite results. Japan then took advantage of Duan's "military governors" mutiny, and Japanese national Nobu Inada came forward to work with Zhang Xun, the head of the braided army, to implement "restoration," expel Li Yuanhong, who was a tool of the United States, and gave Duan Qirui 1 million yen in military expenses, betraying the alliance with Zhang Xun, and quickly dispersed the braided army, so that Duan Qirui could obtain more rights. During this period of turmoil, Li Yuanhong, through his Foreign Minister, the pro-American Wu Tingfang, asked the United States to issue a public statement expressing support for Li Yuanhong as President of China. The American aggressors also felt this was necessary, and on June 4, the U.S. government issued the following advice to China:

    "Whether China goes to war with Germany is a secondary issue... The United States is concerned about China's political system and administrative figures only because of the friendly relations between China and the United States (!), and the United States has no choice but to help China (Note: Li Yuanhong)." (Note: The Eastern Miscellany, Vol. 4, No. 7.)

    On the same day, the U.S. State Department also instructed the U.S. Ministers to Britain, France, and Japan to ask the governments of the three countries to take the same action as the United States and advise all parties in China. Britain and France replied politely. Japan believed that this advice was interfering in China's "internal affairs," that is, interfering with Duan Qirui, and naturally refused the U.S. request. The separate advice given by the United States was also deeply dissatisfied with Japan (Note: See Zhang Zhongfu's previous article, notes 78, 95, 100, etc.). As a result, Li Yuanhong was forced to step down, and the activities of the United States were again determined to be a failure.

    It must be clear here that the reason for the repeated failures of American aggression against China during this period was not that the power used by the United States was insufficient or that its policies were moderate, but that the strength of the competing enemies it faced was too strong—the emerging Japan had also united with a great power, Tsarist Russia. The two countries, Japan and Russia, soon turned from enemies to friends shortly after the end of the war, because the American offensive against China became increasingly tighter. The relationship between Japan and Russia became increasingly close, and between 1907 and October 1916, Japan and Russia successively signed three public agreements and four secret agreements. The fourth secret agreement between Japan and Russia in June 1916 clearly stipulated that the two countries would use military cooperation to protect each other's important interests, and "China must not fall under the political influence of any third country" (Note: The full text is contained in Wang Yunsheng's book, Vol. 7, pp. 43-44). The so-called "third country" was a euphemism for the United States in the minds of Japan and Russia. With such a strong and determined enemy, it is no wonder that the American aggressors could not fulfill their great desires in China.

    Three. The Struggle for Hegemony in China
    (1917-1945, from World War I to the end of World War II)

    The first World War, an imperialist struggle for colonies, reached its peak in 1917. As many as 13 countries in Europe borrowed money from the United States, and the debts of only a few major powers such as Britain, France, Russia, and Italy to the United States would reach 100 billion U.S. dollars. The international status of the United States further improved, and it had the power to compete with the great powers for hegemony in China. However, Britain, which originally had important forces in China, was weakened by the war and retreated to a secondary position. Its investment and creditor rights, etc., were maintained at their original level and decreased to the second place after the war. Germany failed. France was injured. Although the United States ranked third economically (Note: The Eastern Miscellany, Vol. 19, No. 13, Vol. 30, No. 16, Vol. 31, No. 5), its political influence was above Britain and could compete with Japan, which had rapidly expanded during the war and occupied the first place in politics and economy. Especially important, the success of the Russian socialist October Revolution divided the new stage of world history, injected new factors into all subsequent world events, and the direct impact on American aggression against China was the collapse of Tsarist Russia, Japan lost a powerful ally competing with the United States in China, and the enemies facing the United States were relatively simple. All of this made the process of American imperialism's aggression against China reach a new period of competing with the powers, mainly with Japan, for hegemony in China in 1917. The Lansing-Ishii Agreement in November of that year was the first round of the United States' confrontation with Japan in this new period. (Note: The Lansing-Ishii Agreement was established on November 2, a few days before the October (November 7) Revolution. The so-called new period emphasizes the new significance of the agreement. The aggressive forces represented by Japanese imperialism and Tsarist Russia were largely overthrown by the February Revolution.)

                                                                 (To be continued)

　　美国侵华史
    刘大年
  　二　逐渐走向独立侵略中国　（续十二）
    及五月九日，日本向袁世凯提出最后通牒，美国务院赶紧于同月十五日向中日两国发出一个相同的照会，郑重宣称：
    “美国政府兹特声明，现在交涉中之条约，其中任何条款经中国政府承认，而对在华外人之地位有所变更者，在最惠国待遇之下，美国政府亦将享有其利益。”（注：前书，三三一页。）
    美国于此取得了与日本合作的代价。因依此声明作用，美国不但完全避免了日本的打击，日进一步利用日本要求，完全从中国人民身上取得了相同利益。
    袁世凯一度装腔作势之后，整套接受了日美两国的要求。这增强了他反革命反人民的信心，打定主意要做“皇帝”了。一九一五年五月办完卖国交涉，“筹安会”便于八月间出现。日本一面在提出二十一条时即“希望贵总统高升”，一面又扶助反袁世凯的云南起义。美国则百分之百地支持袁世凯称帝，对袁世凯作大量借款，除直接用于帝制的三次共一万万三千六百万之多（？）外，还有同一用途，别立名目——如修浚运河、振兴实业、整顿经济、修筑铁路……等借款，又达三千三百万，且大部分都是反帝制运动爆发后成立的；其中还有刚付款一部袁便死去，又“鉴于中国时局之不靖”停付的（注：参看许指严编民国十周年纪事本末，下册；外交月报，五卷一期；东方杂志，一三卷一一号）。美国人古德诺又以袁世凯“宪法顾问”的资格，发表一篇著名的君主与共和论，说中国如果改用君主制比共和制好，那是丝毫没有疑问的，理由是：“民智低下之国！其人民平日未尝与知政事，绝无政治之智慧（！），则率行共和制，断无善果……否则外人之干涉恐将不免也。”（注：古德诺：共和与君主论，东方杂志，一二卷一○号。）这个著名的“理论”及大批借款，既鼓励了袁世凯，又对反袁世凯的人民施以恫吓。袁世凯虽然依靠这些外援做了皇帝，但是在中国人民的打击下很快滚到坟墓中去了。
    袁世凯的死，使美日侵略者失去能够继续作为总工具的中心人物。日本很快利用了“北洋正统”派的段祺瑞。美国则以继承总统位子的黎元洪为对象。在一个短时间，美国和日本在中国的斗争，又表现为黎元洪与段祺瑞的斗争，所有张勋“复辟”及中国加入第一次世界大战，都是这个斗争的产物。
    大战开始不久，日本以德国占据青岛为借口，攻略山东，美国即怂恿袁世凯向日本提议限制战区，大为日本所反对（注：注日使馆档案，外交部致陆宗舆电，载王芸生前书六卷，四七页）。后英法等又示意中国参战，日本仍多方拦阻，它怕中国因参战而掺入国际活动影响它的侵略。美国乘机大做军火生意，直至一九一七年二月才宣布加入这个强盗战争，并通知北京政府，“如他中立各国能仿美国政府之举动者，实于世界和平将有裨益”（注：一九一七年二月四日，驻北京美国公使致外交部照会），希望把中国人民卷入这个大屠杀的血泊之中，使中国反动统治者取得在战后发言权的代价，作为帮同美国抵抗日本的助手。这虽在作法上与日本完全相反，而动机则完全相同。但这时日本方面的情况已有变化，它既于一九一五年取得二十一条的特别利益，又于一九一七年二、三月间成立与英、法、意、俄四国的秘密谅解，由四国帮助日本非法取得山东权利，日本则以压迫中国对德宣战为交换条件，所以美国对中国提出上述希望时，日本完全赞成。这时段祺瑞是黎元洪手下的“国务总理”，他正好借此机会取得日本援助来扫荡异己，巩固北洋势力，对“参战”进行不遗余力。美国这才发现中国加入作战止是恰好被日本所利用，于是，掉过身来，又主张中国暂时不要对德宣战，免得引起对外纠纷美国不能援救（注：张忠绂：民六中国参战之外交，载东方杂志二三卷一号。）一九一七年三月段祺瑞为对德绝交问题拟具电稿训令驻日公使章宗祥秘密通知日本政府，请黎元洪签名盖印时，被黎拒绝，发生所谓“府院之争（总统府与国务院）”。段祺瑞运用了“公民团”请愿，“国会”讨论及其他种种手法，尚无确定结果，日本便乘段系“督军”哗变，由日人佃信夫出面活动辫军头子张勋与段祺瑞合作实行“复辟”，驱逐作为美国工具的黎元洪，同时又给段祺瑞日金一百万作军费，背弃与张勋的盟约，迅速将辫子军打散，以便段祺瑞取得更多权利。在此扰攘期间，黎元洪由他的外交总长老亲美派伍廷芳，请美国发表公开声明，表示赞成黎元洪为中国大总统，美国侵略者也觉有此需要，六月四日美政府对中国发出这样一个劝告：
    “中国是否对德作战，为次要问题……美国所以关心中国政体及行政人物者，仅中美友谊之关系（！），美国不得不助中国（按：黎元洪）。”（注：东方杂志，四卷七号。）
    同一天，美国务院又训令驻英、法、日三国美使，要他们请三国政府与美国采同一行动，向中国各方劝告，英法两国婉言回复。日本则认为这种劝告是干涉中国“内政”，亦即干涉段祺瑞，对美国的要请当然拒绝。美国所作单独劝告也深为日本所不满（注：以上参看张忠绂前文，七八、九五、一○○等注）。结果黎元洪被迫下台，美国的活动又决定失败。
    这里必须清楚，美国这个时期对中国侵略多次失败的原因，并不是美国所使用的力量不够，或政策和缓，而是它面对着的竞争敌人力量太强大——新兴的日本又联合了一个老大的沙俄。日俄两国在战争结束不久，即由敌人变为朋友，由于美国对中国进攻愈趋愈紧。日俄关系也就愈演愈密，从一九○七年到一九一六年十月之间，日俄连续订了三个公开协定，四个秘密协定，一九一六年六月日俄第四次秘约上更明确规定两国以军事合作来保障双方重要利益，“须要中国不落在任何第三国政治势力之下”（注：全文载王芸生前书，七卷，四三——四四页）。所谓“第三国”在日俄心目中是美国的代名词，有了这样强大而有决心的敌人，美国侵略者不能在中国逞其大欲，就无怪其然了。
    三　争夺中国霸权
    （一九一七——一九四五即第一次世界大战到第二次大战结束）
    帝国主义争夺殖民地的第一次世界大战，到一九一七年达到最高峰。欧洲向美国借债的至十三国之多，仅英、法、俄、意等几个大国即欠美国战债将达一百万万美元。美国国际地位进一步提高，具备了与列强在中国争霸的力量。而原来在中国有重要势力的英国、因被战争削弱，退居次要地位，其投资与债权等方面由维持原状递减至战后，成为第二位。德国失败。法国受伤。美国在经济上虽列第三（注：东方杂志一九卷一三号、三○卷一六号、三十一卷五号），但其政治势力则在英国之上，足与在大战期间迅速澎涨，政治经济都占首席地位的日本并驾齐驱。尤其重要的俄国社会主义十月革命成功，划分了世界历史的新阶段，给后来一切世界事件注入了新的因素，而对于美国侵略中国所发生的直接影响，为沙俄崩溃，日本失去一个在中国与美国竞争的有力同盟者，美国面前的敌人较为单纯。这一切，使美帝国主义侵略中国的进程，在一九一七年达到一个与列强主要是与日本争夺中国霸权的新时期，是年十一月的蓝辛石井协定，是美国在这个新时期与日本交锋的第一个回合。（注：蓝辛石井协定十一月二日成立，在十月（十一月七日）革命前数日。所谓新时期，是着重协定新的意义上，日帝俄所代表的侵略势力，二月革命已大部推翻。）　　　　　　　　　　（未完）
