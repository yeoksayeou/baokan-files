　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 7th. People's organizations from Czechoslovakia and Poland sent telegrams to congratulate the Americas Peace Conference. The telegram from the Czechoslovak Committee for the Defense of Peace on the 5th stated: The maintenance of peace is a matter of concern for the working people themselves. We believe your conference is very important and wish it success. We are pleased that the Pan-American Peace Conference in Mexico City will unite all the forces of the American working people to fight for peace. The telegram from the Polish Committee of Defenders of Peace stated: The Polish Committee of Defenders of Peace, on behalf of the Polish people, sends the most cordial and fraternal greetings to the Peace Conference held in Mexico. We hope that you, who represent the honor of the American continent, will force the warmongers to accept your will. We believe that, just as we were able to drive out the European Nazis who also wanted to force their will on your country, you will certainly be able, together with the American democrats, to prevent the American fascists from succeeding. The fascists are powerless against the strength of the peace camp, as was once again proven at the Moscow Peace Conference in August.

　　捷波两国人民团体
  　电贺美洲和平大会
    【新华社北平七日电】捷、波两国的人民团体致电祝贺美洲拥护和平大会。捷克保卫和平委员会五日的贺电称：和平的维持，是劳动人民本身所关心的事情。我们认为你们的大会是非常重要的，并祝大会成功。我们对于在墨西哥城召开的泛美和平大会将团结美洲劳动人民的一切力量为和平而奋斗，感到满意。波兰保卫和平者委员会的贺电称：波兰保卫和平委员会代表波兰人民，向在墨西哥召开的保卫和平大会致最亲切和兄弟的贺意。希望代表美洲大陆荣誉的你们，将迫使战争贩子接受你们的意志。我们相信，正如我们能够驱逐那些也想要强迫你们国家接受他们的意志的欧洲纳粹一样，你们也一定能够和美国的民主分子一起，使美国的法西斯分子不能获逞。法西斯分子对和平阵营的力量，是无能为力的，这已在八月举行的莫斯科和平大会上再次得到证明。
