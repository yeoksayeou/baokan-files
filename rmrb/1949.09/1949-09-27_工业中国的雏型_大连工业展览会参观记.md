　　A Prototype of Industrial China
　　——Notes on a Visit to the Dalian Industrial Exhibition——
　　Hua Shan
　　The Dalian Industrial Exhibition opened on September 18th. Visiting this exhibition on "September 18th" filled people with particular excitement. Walking from the "Industrial Gate," which features towering golden statues of Stalin and Mao Zedong, towards the venue, the first things one sees are the new type of tire-making boat and the steel-cast anchor chains pioneered in Lushun-Dalian. These are new products jointly created by Soviet technicians and Chinese workers. Entering the exhibition hall, among hundreds of major products and actual objects and models demonstrating the production process, there is the machinery industry, which Stalin called the "heart of heavy industry"; the shipbuilding and railway industries, which constitute the major arteries of industry; and the steelmaking industry, which can be called the "backbone of industry." The chemical industry, which turns air, seawater, and cheap minerals into a large number of valuable products, opens up broad prospects for the field of production. Many light industries and cultural undertakings surround the above four basic industries, forming a coherent whole on the ruins of the former Dalian colonial economy. These industrial production forces, embodying the great friendship of the Soviet Union, whether large and complex machinery or precise balances that can measure one ten-thousandth of a gram, add infinite confidence to the Chinese people who are working hard to build an industrial China.

　　Before liberation, the industry in Lushun-Dalian was mainly developed on a large scale by the Japanese invaders after the "September 18th" Incident. Although the Japanese invaders invested a large amount of capital in eleven years, 90% of the raw materials were transported from other places, and none of the main products could be completed independently. For example, the shipbuilding industry, which can manufacture more than a thousand kinds of parts, could not sail newly built ships without towing them to Japan for final assembly; the railway industry, which employed six thousand workers and twenty factories, could not operate newly built trams without the Osaka-made brake controller. Coupled with the large-scale destruction of industrial equipment by the Japanese invaders when they surrendered, and the sea and land blockade by the US-Chiang reactionaries, the industry in Lushun-Dalian before and after liberation suddenly became a pile of scrap iron. At that time, the Japanese, like the American imperialists today, asserted that the people of Lushun-Dalian would not be able to restore production. However, only three years later, new products that the Japanese could not manufacture here appeared at the exhibition. Six-foot-long planers and complete sets of machine tools have reached the required standards and specifications in terms of precision. Carbon electrodes indispensable for steelmaking and their manufacturing machines, hydraulic presses with ten times the steam pressure for forging and rolling steel, various modern mining machines, acid-resistant boilers required by the chemical industry, tool steel, special steel, high-speed steel, spring steel, and "hard alloys" with a hardness equal to 0.95 of diamond, which are necessary for manufacturing high-grade machinery, all create the conditions for the independent development of the machinery industry. In addition, the appearance of new products such as steam pressure gauges indispensable for manufacturing locomotives, air compressors for controlling power, and three-way valves for automatically operating brakes, has completely changed the nature of the original railway factory, which could only assemble and process parts. Large propellers for seagoing vessels, anchor chains with a reference capacity of 150 tons, diesel engines and steam engines, and many other new products have doubled the scope of shipbuilding business compared to the Japanese era. The chemical industry, which suffered the most damage, can now produce a large number of products, the main ones being a series of products such as sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, and nitric acid, which have always been known as the "mother of the chemical industry," soda ash and calcium carbonate, which are commonly needed by various industries, and more than a dozen products such as magnesium sulfate, potassium cyanide, and sulfate, which are produced from seawater for the first time. The production of cyanide made from coal, seawater, and air is also being restored.

　　These achievements are undoubtedly very valuable for China, where the machinery and chemical industries are particularly weak. The Soviet Union's friendly assistance is a decisive factor in achieving these results. A picture at the exhibition illustrates this point: a Soviet friend holds the hand of a Chinese worker, learning production techniques on a machine. Indeed, the newly growing intellectual circles of Lushun-Dalian workers are being cultivated by Soviet friends. During the Japanese rule in Lushun-Dalian, veteran lathe workers with decades of experience had never seen a blueprint for manufacturing machines. Chemical workers who had worked for half their lives did not understand a simple chemical equation. A Chinese stoker who had stoked locomotives for twenty years had his head broken by a Japanese driver simply for looking at the steam gauge. The Japanese monopolized all production technology, and the Chinese were enslaved by them like cattle and horses. However, the situation since the liberation of Lushun-Dalian is completely different. Soviet friends with great internationalist enthusiasm are using various methods to help Chinese workers improve their knowledge and technical level. They take apprentices, run technical training classes and technical schools, and generally establish deputy positions in factory administrative positions; even women who were never allowed to touch a lathe in the old society have, with the help of Soviet friends, become skilled lathe workers in just two years. When the first Chinese female tram driver appeared on the streets of Dalian, a Soviet passenger happily gave her all the "weekend gifts" she was holding. The Soviet chief of the Dalian Locomotive Depot personally trained six young Chinese women to become locomotive stokers in a short period of three months. In order to ensure that the first batch of female locomotive drivers in New China could appear on "March 8th" next year, he personally lectured them on technical courses whenever he had time, and even followed the departing locomotives, guarding them while they practiced long-distance driving. Under the cultivation of this great internationalist friendship, the railway factory produced 909 new technicians and cadres who mastered specialized technologies in just one year and one month; more than 100 rough laborers in the canal factory also became specialized personnel such as canal chiefs, ship captains, factory directors, technicians, and technicians after four years of training. In the past three years, the Lushun-Dalian area has trained more than 14,000 worker cadres, including 115 people above the level of workshop director. More than 900 heroes and model workers have emerged in industrial production.

　　Advanced Soviet management methods have been widely implemented in Lushun-Dalian public enterprises, and new technologies have also appeared in various factories. After the canal adopted the new Soviet shipbuilding method, the productivity of the same ship has far exceeded twenty times that of the Japanese era. New production upsurges are constantly emerging with the improvement of technical capabilities. Workers are no longer willing to use the Japanese production level as a measuring standard. Their greatest boast is how to exceed the new records they created yesterday today. The Far East Electric Glass Factory, which was awarded the title of "Model Factory," not only completed its annual task in half a year, but also produced giant glass seven millimeters thick, which had not been produced in the twenty-five years since the factory was built. According to the statistics of the eighteen major factories displayed in the industrial exhibition, the average productivity in the first half of this year has reached more than 122%. In just one year last year, the total value created by Lushun-Dalian workers (total output value minus cost) is estimated to be at least 38 times the total consumption value. A lot of national wealth has now been invested in expanded reproduction, and we can begin to embark on a period of regularized construction.

　　After walking through the various exhibition rooms of the industrial exhibition, entering the Sino-Soviet Friendship Hall makes one feel the historical paintings of the revolutionary war are extremely intimate. The October Revolution opened a new era of great friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people. But it was not until the Soviet army liberated the Northeast that the people of Lushun-Dalian were able to build their own happy lives with the direct help of the Soviet Union. Now, the victory of the Chinese People's Liberation Army has finally cleared the obstacles between the people of the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union. The industry in Lushun-Dalian can not only be produced with domestic raw materials, but also can get the direct help of the Soviet Union's advanced technical experience. Every corner of the exhibition is shining with Chairman Mao's historical saying: "Follow the path of the Russians!" This industrial exhibition is a vivid footnote to this famous saying. It not only reviewed the industrial production power of Lushun-Dalian, but also showed the infinitely bright future of industrial China.

　　工业中国的雏型
    ——大连工业展览会参观记——
    华山
    大连工业展览会于九月十八日开幕了。在“九一八”这一天去参观这个会，使人特别感到兴奋。从高耸着斯大林和毛泽东的金色塑像的“工业门”走向会场，首先看到的便是广场上的新型胎造船和旅大首创的钢铸的锚链。这是苏联技师和中国工人共同创造的新产品。进入陈列馆，在数百种主要产品及表现生产过程的机械的实物和模型里面，有斯大林称为“重工业的心脏”的机械工业，有构成工业大动脉的造船工业和铁路工业，有堪称“工业脊骨”的炼钢工业。而把空气、海水和廉价矿石变成大量珍贵产品的化学工业，更给生产领域开辟了广阔的前程。许多轻工业和文化事业便环绕在上述四种基本工业周围，在过去了的大连殖民经济的废墟上结成一个浑然整体。这些凝结着苏联伟大友谊的工业生产力量，不论是庞大复杂的机械，或者是感量十万分之一克的精确天平，无一不给正在为建设工业中国而艰苦奋斗的中国人民，增添无限的信心。
    解放前的旅大工业，主要是日寇在“九一八”事变后大量发展的。日寇在十一年间虽然投下了大量资本，可是原料的百分之九十都是从外地运来，主要产品也没有一种可以单独完成。例如，能制一千多种机件的船舶工业，新造的船只如不拖到日本去最后装配就无法航行；拥有六千职工和二十个工厂的铁路工业，新造的电车没有大阪造的车闸操纵器就无法开动。加上日寇投降时大肆破坏工业设备，以及美蒋反动派的海陆封锁，解放前后的旅大工业，顿时变成一摊废铁。当时日本人也和今天的美帝国主义一样，断言旅大人民无法恢复生产。但是仅只三年以后，日寇在这里所不能制造的新产品却在展览会上出现了。六尺长的板床和整套的工作母机，其精确程度已达到了应有的标准和规格。炼钢不可缺少的炭精电极及其制造机器，锻冶压延钢铁用的比蒸气压力大十倍的水压机，各种现代化的采矿机，化学工业所需的耐酸锅炉，制造高级机械所必需的工具钢、特殊钢、高速度钢、发条钢以及硬度等于金刚石零点九五的“硬质合金”等，都给机械工业创造了可能独立发展的条件。此外，如制造机车时不可缺少的蒸气压力表，控制动力的空气压缩器，自动操纵车闸的三路风门等等，这些新产品的出现，则把原来铁路工厂只能拼凑加工的性质完全改变了。海船用的大螺旋浆，索引量一百五十吨的锚链，柴油发动机和蒸气发动机，以及其他许多新产品，使造船的业务范围比日寇时代扩大一倍。遭受破坏最重的化学工业，现在可以大量生产的，主要的有向来称为“化学工业之母”的硫酸、盐酸、硝酸等一系列产品，各种工业普遍需要的曹达灰和炭酸钙，首次出产的以海水变成的硫酸镁、＠化钾、硫酸盐等十几种产品，以及用煤、海水和空气做的＠的生产也正在恢复中。
    在机械工业和化学工业特别贫弱的中国说来，这些成就无疑是非常可贵的。这些成绩之所以获得，苏联的友谊帮助是一个有决定意义的因素。展览会上的一张画片表示了这一点：一个苏联朋友把住一个中国工人的手，在机器上学习生产技术。的确，刚刚生长起来的旅大工人知识界，正是由苏联朋友亲手培养起来的。在日寇统治旅大时期，十几年的车床老工人没有见过一张制造机器的图纸。劳作半辈子的化学工人不懂得一个简单的化合方程式。一个在机车上烧了二十年火的中国司炉，只因为看了看蒸气表，便被日本司机打得头破血流。日本人垄断着一切生产技术，中国人只是象牛马一样被他们所奴役。可是，旅大解放以来的情形是完全不同了。具有伟大国际主义热情的苏联友人，用各种各样的方法来帮助中国工人提高知识水平、技术水平。他们带徒弟，办技术训练班和技术学校，在工厂行政岗位上普遍设立副职；甚至旧社会从来不准动一动车床的妇女，也在苏联朋友的帮助下，仅只两年时间就成为万能车床的熟练女工。当第一个中国女电车司机在大连市街出现时，一个苏联乘客高兴得把满怀抱着的“周末礼物”全送给了她。大连机务段的苏联段长，亲手在三个月的短时间内把六个中国女青年培养成机车的司炉。为了新中国第一批女机车司机能够在明年“三八”节出现，他一有空就给她们亲自讲授技术课，甚至跟上出发的机车，在旁边守着她们练习长途的驾驶。在这种伟大的国际主义的友谊培养下，铁路工厂仅只一年零一个月便出现了九百零九个掌握专门技术的新技工和干部；船渠工厂的一百多个粗杂工人，经过四年的培养也全部成为渠长、船长、厂长、技师、技手等专门人材了。三年来旅大地区共培养了一万四千多个工人干部，其中场长以上的就有一百一十五人。在工业生产中出现的英雄模范竟达九百余人之多。
    苏联先进的管理方法已经在旅大公营企业中普遍的实行，新技术也在各个工厂出现。船渠采用了苏联新造船法以后，同样一只船的生产率已远超过日寇时代的二十倍以上了。新的生产高涨随着技术能力的提高而不断出现。工人们已经不屑于以日本的生产水平作为衡量的尺度了，他们最大的夸耀就是如何在今天超过昨天自己所创造的新纪录。荣膺“模范工厂”的远东电业玻璃工厂不但在半年内完成了全年任务，而且造出了建厂二十五年以来所没有的七米厘厚的巨型玻璃。根据工业展览会中所陈列的十八个主要工厂的统计，今年上半年的平均生产率已达到百分之一二二以上。仅仅是去年一年，旅大工人的创造总值（生产总值减去成本），据占计最少也达到消费总值的三十八倍。现在已经有很多的国家财富投入扩大再生产，可以开始走上正规化的建设时期了。
    在走遍工业展览会的各个陈列室之后，走进中苏友谊馆，更觉得那几幅革命战争的史画无比亲切。十月革命开辟了中苏两国人民伟大友谊的新时代。可是直到苏军解放东北以后，旅大人民才能够在苏联直接帮助下建设自己的幸福生活。现在，中国人民解放军的胜利最后把帝国主义和国民党反动派横在中苏两大国人民之间的障碍扫清了。旅大的工业不但可以用国产的原料进行生产，而且可以得到苏联先进的技术经验的直接帮助了。展览会各个角落都闪耀着毛主席的历史名言：“走俄国人的路！”这个工业展览会正是这句名言的一个生动的注脚。它不但检阅了旅大工业的生产力量，而且也展现出工业中国无限光明的前途。
