Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 2nd. Shanghai's youth from all walks of life gathered at Yiyuan Square on the evening of the 1st to warmly celebrate International Youth Day. More than 15,000 youth representatives from all walks of life and more than 40 members of the Soviet Overseas Chinese Association attended the meeting. At the meeting, Li Chang, director of the Shanghai Municipal Working Committee of the New Democratic Youth League, called on the one million young people in Shanghai to organize and fight to realize the six major tasks of smashing the enemy's blockade and building a new Shanghai. Mayor Chen Yi and Feng Wenbin, secretary of the Central Committee of the Youth League, spoke successively, pointing out that the victory of Chinese youth is inseparable from the struggle of world youth. Without the struggle and assistance of the democratic youth of the Soviet Union and the new democratic countries of Eastern Europe, China's victory would not have been as great and as fast as it is today. Lu Cui, the Chinese resident secretary of the Women's International Democratic Federation, cited many facts in her speech, explaining that the Chinese youth movement under the leadership of the Communist Party has consistently followed the path of combining patriotism and internationalism. The congress finally adopted a congratulatory message to the Second Congress of the World Federation of Democratic Youth.

　　沪市青年集会
  　欢庆国际青年节
    【新华社上海二日电】上海市各界青年一日晚上在逸园广场上集会，热烈庆祝国际青年节。到会各界青年代表一万五千多人和苏侨协会会员四十多人。会上，新民主主义青年团上海市工作委员会主任李昌，号召上海的一百万青年组织起来，为实现粉碎敌人封锁建设新上海的六大任务而斗争。陈毅市长和青年团中央委员会书记冯文彬相继讲话，他们指出中国青年的胜利是和世界青年的斗争分不开的。如果没有苏联和东欧各新民主国家民主青年的斗争和援助，中国的胜利是不可能象今天这样大，这样快的。世界民主妇女联合会中国驻会书记陆璀在讲话中，列举了许多事实，说明在共产党领导下的中国青年运动，是一贯地循着爱国主义和国际主义相结合的道路前进的。大会最后通过了给世界民主青年联合会第二次代表大会的贺电。
