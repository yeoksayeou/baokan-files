Vigorously Promote Field Seed Selection
	Yang Qingzheng, Zhang Yongfu, Shijiazhuang Farm

As the saying goes, "What kind of gourd, what kind of ladle," "What kind of millet, what kind of seedling," meaning that good seeds are essential for a good harvest. Therefore, field seed selection (i.e., selecting good seeds in the field) is an important step in improving production technology based on the existing conditions of farmers and a good way to produce more grain. However, most farmers think that field seed selection is too time-consuming and are afraid of damaging the crops by walking around in the field. In fact, seed selection is not a very troublesome task, only requiring a day and a half. Now that the autumn crops are about to mature in various places, we offer some suggestions for carrying out field seed selection work for your reference:

		I. Five Major Benefits of Field Seed Selection

	1. Can increase yield: Implementing field seed selection can indeed increase yield. For example, the Nunglin No. 4 sweet potato can yield two-thirds to one times more per mu than local sweet potatoes. If you plant one mu, it's equivalent to planting one and a half to two mu. Isn't this an obvious fact?

	2. Can reduce disasters: Among crops, some are strong against wind, some are drought-resistant, and some are resistant to pests and diseases (for example, "72" wheat has mild jaundice, "811" millet and "Dazimu" millet have long awns, which are not afraid of wind abrasion, and there is also a "Qisewu" sorghum, which is not afraid of wind and fog under any circumstances...). If we select seeds that are strong against wind, drought, and pests and diseases, we can reduce these disasters.

	3. Can synchronize harvesting time: When crops are about to ripen, the crops in a field often have some that are ripe and old, while others are just sprouting. Harvesting is very inconvenient. If the seed selection work is done well, this problem of uneven maturity can be avoided.

	4. Can unify the color of crops: In a field of millet, there are yellow stalks, purple stalks, and red stalks. Later, when the rice is milled, there are large ones, small ones, yellow ones, and white ones, all mixed up. This is all because seed selection has not been done. If good seed selection is carried out, these messy situations will not occur.

	5. Can make crops uniformly tall: Crops growing at different heights are caused by different seeds. If seed selection is implemented, this situation will not occur.

The seed selection method commonly used by farmers is threshing ground selection (i.e., selecting good seeds in the threshing ground). This method has many shortcomings:

	1. Easy to transmit smut disease: When crops are pulled from the field to the threshing ground, after bundling and transportation, smut powder is easily transmitted to good seed grains. 2. Seeds are easily mixed. 3. The growing environment of the seed panicles is unknown. 4. The height of the stalks and the earliness or lateness of maturity are unknown. If field seed selection is implemented, the above-mentioned problems can be avoided, and we can select the ideal good seeds. Therefore, it should be vigorously promoted.

		II. Standards for Seed Selection

The standards for seed selection cannot be uniformly enforced due to differences in soil quality (i.e., soil texture and soil properties), climate, the needs of the masses (some places suffer from wind disasters, and the masses urgently demand seeds with strong wind resistance; some places suffer from drought nine years out of ten, and they urgently demand drought-resistant seeds), and planting habits in various regions. The seed selection standards described below are for your reference only.

	1. Cotton: A detailed introduction has already been given in the previous issue of "Agricultural Production," so I will not repeat it here.

	2. Millet: (1) The panicle should be large and the grains should be dense (large panicles will definitely yield more, and dense grains will not only yield more but also be less prone to shattering). (2) The stalks should be straight and thick, not easily blown down by the wind. Special attention should be paid to this in areas that frequently suffer from wind disasters, and thick stalks also produce more straw. (3) The grains should be plump and full (plump and full grains are directly related to yield and have strong germination power). (4) Maturity should be early, and the grains of the entire panicle should mature uniformly (early maturity can allow the land to rest earlier, and uniform maturity can reduce the loss of shattering). (5) Panicles and plants free from pests and diseases (panicles and plants free from pests and diseases must have strong resistance to pests and diseases).

	3. Sorghum: (1) The stalks should be thick and strong, and the height should be moderate (special attention should be paid to this in windy areas, but the needs of the local area should also be considered). (2) The panicles should be large with many grains that are plump and full (this will definitely yield more, and plump and full grains will definitely produce more flour and have strong germination power for seeds). (3) The branches and grains of the panicle should be dense (dense branches and grains of the panicle will definitely increase yield, but in areas with serious bird damage, panicles with loose branches should be selected). (4) The color of the grains should be uniform. (5) Maturity should be early (this can reduce bird damage and allow for early plowing, allowing the land to rest). (6) Panicles and plants free from pests and diseases (those free from pests and diseases also have strong resistance to pests and diseases).

	4. Corn: (1) The ears should grow in the middle of the stalk (not easily blown down by the wind). (2) The rows of kernels should be straight and tight, and the kernels should be filled to the top. (3) The ears should be thick and long, and the cob should be as thin as possible (thick and long ears will definitely have more kernels, and thin cobs will have thicker kernels, thus increasing yield). (4) The thickness of the ear should be about the same from top to bottom (if so, the area for growing kernels is large). (5) The husks of the ears should be thick and dense (dense husks can avoid insect damage). (6) The kernels should be large, mature early, and have the same color (large kernels yield more, early maturity can reduce disasters, and allow the land to be plowed and rested earlier). (7) Panicles and plants free from pests and diseases (those free from pests and diseases have stronger resistance to pests and diseases).

		III. Seed Selection Methods

	1. Panicle Selection: For sorghum, millet, and corn, the method of panicle selection can be used. Before implementing seed selection, you should consider in advance whether your crops are good. If you think your seeds are good, then implement seed selection in your own field. One or two days before the harvest of sorghum, millet, corn, etc., go to the field and pick the panicles that meet the standards of field seed selection, tie them into bundles, or put them in cloth bags, and thresh, store, and save them separately for sowing next year. After the ears are left, they can be stored with the husks for a few days, then peeled, dried, and only the middle section of the kernels is used, and the kernels at both ends are discarded. This section of ear kernels, when planted, will be neat, uniform, and strong.

	2. Area Selection: If too many seeds are needed next year, area selection can be implemented. That is, when the crops are about to be harvested, select a piece of land or pick a piece with good color and strong growth in a large field, pull out the ears that mature too early, too late, are diseased, or are individually hybridized with local crops, harvest and thresh them separately, and store them separately for use as seeds. For millet, rice, broomcorn millet, foxtail millet, and other small-ear crops that are planted in large quantities, this method can be used for seed selection.

	3. Seed Exchange: Although seed exchange is not something that should be discussed within the scope of field seed selection, it is also very important in seed selection work. Most farmers already have some foundation in this, that is, if there are better seeds in their village or in the homes of relatives and friends than their own, then they can exchange them and plant them in their own fields, and then implement field seed selection next year.

	4. Several points should be noted when selecting seeds: (1) Do not select seeds near wells or ditches, because crops in these places get more water and are prone to grow well. This is because their growing environment is good, not because the seeds are good. (2) Do not select seeds at the ends of fields or edges of fields, also because the environment is special and they are prone to cross-pollination with crops from neighboring fields. (3) Do not select seeds in places where fertilizer has been applied, because the fertilizer content is higher in places where fertilizer has been applied, and the crops grow well, which is also caused by the environment, not because the seeds themselves are good. (4) Select in the middle of a large field, in the same area, in the same environment. If you can find particularly large ears, this is our ideal standard for seed selection.

		IV. How to Promote Field Seed Selection

Field seed selection is a simple and easy task in terms of technology. The key issue is how to promote this technology among the farmers. Here are a few suggestions:

	1. Transmit field seed selection technology to production cadres and farmers: Field seed selection technology should be transmitted to production cadres and farmers through methods such as typical demonstrations, technical seminars, and visits to experienced farmers, so that they can deeply understand the methods, benefits, and importance of seed selection and automatically implement seed selection.

	2. Do not demand too much at the beginning: Field seed selection does not yet have a foundation among farmers in various regions. When promoting it at the beginning, you should first select two or three households as a demonstration. It is best to focus on labor heroes, production cadres, and experienced farmers in the village to lay a foundation for widespread promotion next year. Do not demand too much at the beginning, so as to avoid the problem of aiming too high and being divorced from reality.

	3. Organize the masses to visit and exchange seeds: When the crops are about to be harvested, the production leaders in various places should organize experienced farmers to visit and exchange seeds in towns and cities in the form of old farmer forums. This has a great effect. When the old farmers generally recognize that these seeds are good through the visit, they will consciously start exchanging them. This is a good way to promote seed selection. Last year, the Agricultural Technology Extension Team of the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region planted thirteen mu of good seeds (millet and sweet potatoes) in Baisha Village, Tang County. When they matured, they invited local farmers to hold a visit. As a result, they asked to exchange seeds one after another, which played a great role. This is a powerful illustration.

	4. Select more good local seeds: Each region has some good local seeds. Production leaders in various places should put forward good local seeds that are welcomed by the local masses. Because the exchanged seeds meet the needs of the local area, this method is easily accepted by the masses.

	5. Gradually hand over the task of seed selection to women: Field seed selection is a simple and easy task that women can also do. In the current situation of labor shortage among the masses, it is not only necessary but also possible to gradually hand over this task to the vast number of women. We should vigorously promote this!

　　大力推广田间选种
    石家庄农场杨清政、张永富
    俗话说“什么葫芦什么瓢”“什么谷子什么苗”，这意思就是有了好种籽，才有好收成。所以田间选种（即到地里挑选好种籽）是从农民现有的基础上把生产技术提高一步的重要环节，是多打粮食的好方法。但是老乡们大多以为田间选种太费工夫，又怕在地里趟来趟去，损坏了庄稼，其实选种并不是一件太麻烦的事，只要用一天半晌就行了。眼前各地大秋的庄稼就要成熟了，如何进行田间选种工作，提供几点意见，以做各地参考：
    　　　　一、田间选种的五大好处
    １、可增加产量：实行田间选种，确能增加收成，例如农林四号甘薯每亩能比本地甘薯多收三分之二至一倍，那么种一亩就顶种一亩半至二亩，这不是一个很明显的事实吗？
    ２、可减少灾害：庄稼里头有抗风力强的，有耐旱力强的，也有抵抗病虫害力强的（例如“七二”小麦黄疸轻，“八一一”谷“大兹母”谷，穗头毛长，不怕风磨，又有一种气死雾高粱，它在什么情况下也不怕风雾……等），如果我们挑选了抗风、抗旱、抗病虫力较强的种籽，就能减少这些灾害。
    ３、能使收成时间一致：庄稼快要熟的时候，一块地里的庄稼常有熟老的，有才吐穗的，收割起来很不方便，如果做好了选种工作，就可避免这种成熟期不齐的毛病了。
    ４、能使庄稼色道一样：在一块地里的谷子，有黄秸、紫秸、红秸的，以后碾出米来，有大的、小的、黄的、白的，杂七乱八，这全是没有选种的缘故，如果进行了很好的选种，就不会有这些杂乱情形了。
    ５、能使庄稼高矮一律：庄稼长的七高八低，参差不齐，就是因为种籽不一样所致，如果实行选种，就没有这种情形了。
    老乡常用的选种方法，是场选（即在场里挑选好种籽），这种方法，缺点很多：
    １、容易传染黑穗病：庄稼从地里拉到场里，经过捆绑、装运，黑疸粉容易传染到好的种粒上面。２、种籽容易混杂。３、不知种穗生长的环境。４、不知秸秆的高低及成熟的早晚。如果实行用田间选种，就可以避免上述的毛病，而能选到我们理想的好种籽，所以应该大力提倡。
    　　　　二、选种的标准
    各地区的土质（即土脉土性）、气候、群众的需要（有些地方闹风灾，群众迫切要求抗风力强的种籽，有些地方十年九旱，他们迫切要求抗旱的种籽）和种植习惯的不同，选种的标准，不能强求统一，下面所说的选种标准，只供大家参考。
    １、棉花：上期“农业生产”已有详细介绍，兹不赘。
    ２、谷子：（１）穗要大，籽粒要紧密（穗大收量必多，籽粒紧密，不但收量大，且不易脱粒）。（２）秸秆要直要粗，不易被风刮倒，常闹风灾之地，尤应注意，且秸杆粗出草多。（３）籽粒要充实饱满（籽粒充实饱满，与收量直接有关，且发芽力强大）。（４）成熟要早，且全穗籽粒成熟一致（成熟早可使地早休闲，成熟一致，可减少脱粒之损失。（５）无病虫害的穗株（无病虫害的穗株，其抗病虫害的力量必强）。
    ３、高粱：（１）秸秆粗壮，高低适中（多风之地尤应注意，但亦应注意当地之需要）。（２）穗大粒多而饱满充实（这样收量必多，籽粒饱满充实出面必多，做种发芽力强）。（３）穗枝穗粒要紧密（穗枝穗粒紧密，产量必多，但鸟害严重之处，宜选散放之穗）。（４）粒粒色泽一致。（５）成熟要早（既可减少鸟害，又可提早耕地，使地休闲）。（６）不染病虫害的穗株（不染病虫害的，其抗病虫力亦强）。
    ４、玉蜀黍：（１）果穗生于茎之中部者（不易被风刮倒）。（２）果粒行列宜直、宜紧、粒灌到顶。（３）穗要粗长，穗轴越细越好（穗粗长籽粒必多，穗轴细籽粒必厚，如是产量必多）。（４）穗之上下粗细差不多的（如是，生长籽粒的面积大）。（５）果穗的苞叶宜厚宜密（苞叶紧密，可避免虫害）。（６）籽粒肥大，成熟早，颜色一样者（肥大产量多，成熟早可减少灾害，使地早耕早闲）。（７）不染病虫害的穗株（不染病虫害者，其抗病虫害力较强。）
    　　　　三、选种的方法
    １、挑穗：高粱、谷子、玉蜀黍，可以用挑穗的办法，在没有实行选种以前，应当预先考虑一下，自己的庄稼是否好，如果认为自己的种籽好，那么就在自己地里实行选种。当高粱、谷子、玉蜀黍等收割的前一两天，到地里将合乎田间选种标准的，把穗摘下来，绑扎成捆，或装在布口袋里，另行脱粒、储藏，以作来年播种之用。棒子留下后，可让它带皮存放几天，再剥皮、晒干，只要当中一段的粒子，两端的部分不要，这一段棒子粒种起来是又整齐，又匀实，又健壮。
    ２、片选：如果明年需要种籽太多的话，可施行片选。就是当庄稼将收割时，选一块或在大块地当中挑一片成色好长的强的，把成熟太早的，太晚的，有病害的，与和本地庄稼个别的杂穗拔去，另收另打，另外保存起来作种。谷子、稻子、黍子籽、稷子等小穗庄稼种得多的，可以用这个法子来选种。
    ３、换种：换种虽不是田间选种范围以内应讲的事，但在选种工作上亦很重要，农民群众中差不多已有一些基础，就是在本村或是亲友家里，有比自己还好的种籽，那么就可换取，种在自己的田内，到明年再实行田间选种。
    ４、选种的时候应当注意几点：（１）不在井旁或水沟旁选，因为这些地方，庄稼得水较多，容易长得好，这是它生长的环境好，而不是种籽好。（２）不在地头地边选，也是因为环境特殊，且易与地邻的庄稼传花杂交。（３）不在放过肥料的地方选，因为放过肥料的地方，肥分比它处多，庄稼长的好，也是环境造成的，并不是它本身的种籽好。（４）要在大田当中，同样地区，同样环境，如能发现特别的大穗，这才是我们理想的选种的标准。
    　　　　四、怎样推广田间选种
    田间选种在技术上是一件简而易行的事。问题的关键是如何把这个技术推广于农民群众中去，这里提供几点意见：
    １、把田间选种技术传授于生产干部及农民群众：田间选种的技术应该通过典型示范、技术座谈、老农访问等方式，传授于生产干部及群众，使他们深切了解选种的方法、好处及重要性，自动的实行选种。
    ２、开始不可要求过高：田间选种在各地农民群众中还没有一些基础，开始推行时，应该先选择两三户，作为示范性质，最好抓住村中劳动英雄、生产干部及有经验的老农等积极分子，打下一个来年普遍推广的基础，开始不可要求过高，以免好高鹜远，脱离实际的毛病。
    ３、组织群众参观换种：当庄稼快要收割的时候，各地生产领导上，应当把优良品种在集镇和城市，就地以老农座谈会的形式，组织有经验的老农参观换种，作用是很大的，当通过参观老农公认这种种籽好的时候，就会自觉的展开互换了，这是推广选种很好的方式。去年晋察冀边区农业技术推广队在唐县白沙村种了十三亩好种籽（谷子和甘薯），当成熟的时候，邀请了当地的老农，举行了一次参观，结果他们纷纷要求换种，起了很大的作用，这是一个有力的说明。
    ４、多挑选本地的好种籽：各地区都有一些本地的好种籽，各地生产领导上，应就地提出本地群众所欢迎的好种籽，这种方法，因所换种籽适合当地的需要，故容易为群众所接受。
    ５、把选种的任务逐步交给妇女：田间选种是一件简而易行的工作，妇女也能够办到的，在目前群众劳力缺乏的情况下，把这个任务逐步交给广大妇女，不但是必要而且能够担当起来的，我们应当大力提倡！
