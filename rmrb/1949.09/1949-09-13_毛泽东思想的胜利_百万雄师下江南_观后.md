　　The Victory of Mao Zedong Thought
　　--After Watching "A Million Soldiers Cross the Yangtze River"

　　The film "A Million Soldiers Cross the Yangtze River" begins simply by helping the audience recall the Kuomintang bandit gang's adventurous and sinful war launched in June 1946, because at that time the Chiang bandit gang believed that he had more than four million regular and irregular troops, he controlled the big cities, he also possessed a population of more than 300 million, and he also received all the equipment of the one million Japanese invaders in China. However, the People's Liberation Army had only a little more than one million, and its equipment was far inferior to that of the Kuomintang. Therefore, the Chiang bandit gang believed that it would only take three to six months to defeat the People's Liberation Army. But "From the day Chiang Kai-shek launched the counter-revolutionary war, we said that we must not only defeat Chiang Kai-shek, but also be able to defeat him." "When the sky seems dark, we point out: This is only a temporary phenomenon, the storm is about to pass, and the dawn is just ahead." (Chairman Mao on the Current Situation and Our Tasks) Historical proof: the facts are proceeding completely according to Mao Zedong's instructions. A million soldiers crossed the Yangtze River, went straight to Shanghai, Suzhou, and Hangzhou, and entered the "Presidential" Palace. From the screen, we saw a mess in the "Presidential" Palace, and even the "President's" portrait had not been taken down, hanging lonely on the wall. Today, the heroic advance is marching towards the Great Northwest and South China. The victorious banner of Mao Zedong will be planted at the foot of the Northwest and on the coast of the South China Sea. Therefore, the victory of a million soldiers crossing the Yangtze River is the victory of Mao Zedong Thought.

　　毛泽东思想的胜利
    ——“百万雄师下江南”观后
    张夫
    “百万雄师下江南”的影片开头简单地帮助观众回忆一九四六年六月蒋介石匪帮发动冒险的罪恶战争，因为那时蒋匪帮认为他有正规军与非正规军共有四百余万，他控制了大城市，他又拥有三万万以上的人口，又接收了日本侵华一百万人的全部装备，而人民解放军只有一百多万，装备也远不如国民党，所以蒋匪帮认为只须三个月至六个月就可以打败人民解放军，但“从蒋介石发动反革命战争的一天起，我们就说，我们不但必须打败蒋介石，而且能够打败他。”“当天空似乎黑暗的时候，我们就指出：这不过是暂时的现象，暴风雨即将过去，曙光即在前头”。（毛主席论目前形势与我们的任务）历史的证明：事实完全循着毛泽东的指示在进行。百万雄师飞渡长江，直捣上海、苏州、杭州，进入了“总统”府，从银幕上看到“总统”府里一片狼籍，连“总统”的像都没来得及取下，孤零零地悬在墙上。今天英勇的进军正向大西北、华南挺进，毛泽东胜利的旗帜将插在西北之麓，南海之滨了。所以百万雄师下江南的胜利，是毛泽东思想的胜利。
