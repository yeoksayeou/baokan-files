Strengthening the Work of Female Workers
　　Gathering of Female Worker Cadres in Public Factories
[Our Newspaper] On the afternoon of the 18th, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions' Women Workers Department and the industrial unions convened a joint meeting of female worker cadre from public factories. Zhang Hongshun, director of the industrial union, first reviewed the industrial unions' past lack of attention to female worker issues, explaining that it was wrong to regard female worker work as an accessory or secondary task. Today, we must put this work forward as an important task. In the past, everyone has done female worker work, but the ideology was not clear enough. In the future, the industrial unions will assign certain cadres to be responsible for this work and maintain close contact with the female workers' departments of each factory.
    Zhao Jianqi, secretary of the Women Workers Department, conveyed Cai Chang's report, which proposed that the task of female worker work is to organize, mobilize, and educate female workers so that they can complete their production tasks. Specific tasks are: 1. Mobilize female workers to participate in trade union organizations, trade union activities, and trade union work. 2. Carry out female worker education. 3. Female worker welfare work. 4. Cultivate female worker cadres. 5. Work on the families of workers. Regarding the issue of female worker representative conferences, she emphasized asking everyone to experiment in their respective factories, saying: "The female worker representative conference is the most effective organizational form for contacting the masses. It can be based on the female worker representatives in the worker representative conference, plus the selection of several female workers to form a group to study and discuss the special problems of female workers." Finally, she said: "To welcome the Asian-Australian Workers' Representative Conference and the Women's Representative Conference, we must strengthen the internationalist education of female workers and mobilize female workers to participate in such activities, especially when taking classes, female workers should listen carefully and actively participate in discussions. Specific work in terms of welfare is to start preparing for nurseries; for the labor protection issues of female workers, such as regulations on maternity leave, we also hope to solicit the opinions of female workers and study them together."
    Chairman He Liping arranged the work for this month, and then everyone started discussing the nursery issue. The Clothing Factory, the People's Printing Factory, and the Telecommunications Bureau reported the process of collecting opinions and specific difficulties such as housing costs.
    Finally, Zhang Xiaomei, Minister of Women Workers, requested that the heads of the Women Workers' Departments, trade union members, representatives, and group leaders of each factory establish the important concept of female worker work in the spirit of everyone running the trade union, pay attention to cultivating female worker cadres, and promote female workers to participate in leadership work. She explained that the work of nurseries is to solve the immediate problems of women, and is an indispensable work for the thorough liberation of women. In China, it is an even fresher undertaking, requiring overcoming many ideological concerns and material difficulties. Nurseries should be established in places where it is possible, such as the Telecommunications Bureau. Running a nursery well can not only provide us with some experience, but also take concrete actions to publicize it to female workers, so that they understand that nurseries not only facilitate the work of mothers, but also can improve the physical and mental development of children. Finally, she said: "The city-wide workers' congress and women's congress will be held soon. When producing worker representatives, we must strive for a certain number of female workers to be elected. At the same time, these female worker representatives are the foundation of female worker representatives in the women's congress. Their tasks are twofold, and everyone should be especially cautious when electing them." The meeting adjourned at ten o'clock.

### 加强女工工作　公营工厂女工部干部集会

　　加强女工工作
  　公营工厂女工部干部集会
    【本报讯】十八日下午市总工会女工部及产业工会召开公营工厂女工部干部联席会议，产业工会主任张鸿舜首先检讨了过去产业工会对女工工作不够重视，说明把女工工作看做是附带的或次要的工作是错误的，今天我们要必须把这一工作作为一个重要的工作提出来。过去大家也做了女工工作，但思想上不够明确。以后产业工会要分配一定的干部负责这一工作，和各厂女工部密切联系。
    女工部秘书赵剑歧传达了蔡畅的报告，提出女工工作的任务就是组织发动教育女工，使能完成生产任务。具体工作是：一、动员女工参加工会组织、工会活动和工会工作。二、进行女工教育。三、女工福利工作。四、培养女工干部。五、工人家属工作。关于女工代表会议问题，她着重提出请大家在各厂试验，并说：“女工代表会议是最能联系群众的组织形式，可以以工人代表会议中的女工代表为基础，再加选女工若干人组成，以便研究讨论女工的特殊问题。”最后，她说：“为迎接亚澳职工代表会和妇女代表会，我们要加强女工国际主义教育，应发动女工参加这类活动，特别在上课时要女工好好听讲，积极参加讨论。在福利方面的具体工作就是着手筹办托儿所；女工劳保问题，如产假等的规定，也希望征求女工意见，大家一起研究。”
    主席贺立平布置了本月份工作以后，大家便对托儿所问题展开讨论。被服厂、人民印刷厂、电信局等都报告了搜集意见的经过及房屋费等具体困难。
    最后女工部长张晓梅要求各厂女工部长、工会委员、代表、小组长在大家办工会的精神下，树立女工工作重要的观念，注意培养女工干部，提拔女工参加领导工作。她说明托儿所工作是解决妇女切身问题，使妇女彻底得到解放不可缺少的工作，在中国更是一个新鲜的事业，需要克服很多思想上的顾虑和物质上的困难，在可能举办的地方如电信局，应尽力举办。办好一个托儿所不但可以提供我们一些经验，而且可以拿具体行动向女工们做宣传，使她们懂得托儿所不但便利了母亲的工作，而且可以健全儿童身心的发展。最后她说：“不久就要召开全市的工人代表大会和妇女代表大会，在产生工人代表时，我们要争取一定数量的女工当选，同时这些女工代表，就是妇女代表大会中女工代表的基础，她们的任务是双重的，大家选举时特别慎重。”会议开至十时始散。
