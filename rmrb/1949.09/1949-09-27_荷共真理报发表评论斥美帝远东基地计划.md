　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 25th: TASS, The Hague, September 23rd: The Dutch Communist Party's Truth newspaper commented on the US plan to establish military bases in the Far East, stating: The United States hopes not only to dabble in Surabaya, Java, but also in important bases such as Singapore and Hong Kong. The newspaper stated: As it is now revealed, the US government, in view of the development of the situation in China, held a meeting in mid-August to discuss in detail how to strengthen the US position in the Far East. The State Department, headed by Acheson, was ordered to take all necessary measures to obtain British and French bases in the Far East. As a result, in addition to Surabaya, the United States also hopes to obtain Singapore and Hong Kong, two fortresses of British imperialism. In addition, the United States also requires the strategic position of Sarawak (British Borneo), the strategic position on the Cocos Islands, and Patani (in the Moluccas Islands). The United States also requires France to hand over two Vietnamese bases, including coastal defense, to the United States for management. The United States also requires Burma to hand over the Akyab base to the United States for management.

　　荷共真理报发表评论斥美帝远东基地计划
    【新华社北平二十五日电】塔斯社海牙二十三日讯：荷共真理报评美国在远东建立军事基地的计划称：美国希望不仅染指于爪哇的泗水，而且染指于象新加坡与香港这样重要的基地。该报称：一如现在所透露者，美国政府鉴于中国局势的发展，曾于八月中旬召开会议，详细地讨论了如何加强远东美国地位的计划。以艾奇逊为首的国务院受命采取一切必要的措施，以取得英国和法国在远东的基地。结果是美国除泗水外，还希望取得英国的新加坡和香港——英帝国主义的两个堡垒。除此而外，美国还要求萨拉瓦克（英属婆罗洲）的战略阵地，科科斯群岛上的战略阵地和巴达尼（在摩鹿加群岛）。美国还要求法国必需拿出包括海防在内的两个越南基地，交由美国管理。美国并要求缅甸拿出阿恰布基地，交由美国管理。
