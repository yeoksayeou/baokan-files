　　【Baoding News】Since the beginning of the hot season, excessive rainfall and humid soil in Hebei Province, coupled with sultry temperatures, have led to pest infestations in forty counties including Fengrun in eastern Hebei, Xushui north of Baoding, Shenxian, Shulu, Ningjin, Nangong, Jixian, and Xingtai along the Shide Railway. These pests are consuming cotton, millet, sorghum, corn, and beans, seriously threatening this year's autumn harvest. Local leading authorities are vigorously organizing the masses to catch insects, and the affected areas have been greatly reduced. When mobilizing and organizing the masses to eliminate pests in various disaster areas, cadres were assigned to go deep into the countryside to provide leadership and put forward slogans such as "eliminate pests on the day they appear, eliminate pests locally," and "sweat more now, eat your fill later," which were greatly supported by the farmers, ensuring the smooth progress of the pest elimination work. The Xingtai Prefectural Party Committee, Administrative Office, and Party School, among other agencies, dispatched more than 1,700 cadres to form six pest elimination teams, which went to six counties including Ningnan to lead farmers in catching insects. Shulu, Shenxian, Ningjin, and other counties transferred 659 cadres and faculty members to the countryside to eliminate pests together with the farmers. Several state-owned farms and production promotion agencies supplied large quantities of pesticides and spraying equipment to assist farmers in eliminating pests. With the leadership and assistance, the farmers worked day and night, rain or shine, to eliminate pests with great enthusiasm and achieved considerable results. For example, in Huowangdian, District One of Xushui County, 646 jin of insect eggs were picked in one day; in Quanchuan Yuan, District Ten of Fengrun County, 220 women sprayed 1,290 mu of crops three times in ten days; and in Gu County, a seven-day blitz resulted in the capture and elimination of more than 11,500 jin of bean worms, protecting 130,178 mu of crops throughout the county. The above achievements are closely related to the number of mobilized masses. According to incomplete statistics, in Fengrun County alone, 32 villages had more than 2,500 women and children catching insects; Gu County mobilized more than 57,770 people in seven days; and in five districts of Ningjin, more than 34,000 people participated in catching insects in one day. Currently, in some areas, the pest infestation has been eliminated, while in others, efforts are still being made to eliminate the pests. In this pest elimination campaign, there are still some shortcomings. In general, not enough attention was paid to pest prevention work in most areas. Pest elimination was only organized after the pests were discovered. (Nangong County did relatively well in this regard, as it instructed all districts to conduct in-depth inspections and prevent pests in a timely manner before the pest infestation occurred. When insect eggs were discovered in various places, a campaign to cut off leaves with insect eggs was immediately launched, and the pests were quickly eliminated.) Secondly, the masses were not thoroughly mobilized and enlightened, and the commandist style of compulsory orders still existed. The work was rough and not thorough enough to completely eliminate the pests, and the vast numbers of women and children were not vigorously mobilized. These are all shortcomings in the work of most affected areas.

### 河北四十余县　组织广大农民大力扑灭虫害

　　河北四十余县
  　组织广大农民大力扑灭虫害
    【保定讯】入伏以来，河北省雨量过多，土地潮湿，又加气温溽暑，致冀东的丰润，保定以北的徐水，石德铁路两侧的深县、束鹿、宁晋、南宫、冀县及邢台等四十个县都发生了虫害，吃食棉花、谷子、高粱、玉黍及豆类，严重威胁今年的秋收，各地领导机关大力组织群众进行捕虫，受灾地面已大为缩小。各灾区在发动与组织群众灭虫时，曾分派干部深入农村领导并提出“当天发生当天消灭，当地发生当地消灭”，“眼前多流汗，将来吃饱饭”等口号，极得农民拥护，使灭虫工作顺利进行。邢台地委、专署、党校等机关抽出干部一千七百余人，组成六个灭虫组，分赴宁南等六县领导农民捕虫。束鹿、深县、宁晋等县抽调干部及教职员六百五十九人下乡与农民一起灭虫。若干公营农场与生产推进社大批供给除虫药及喷射器具，协助农民灭虫。农民得到领导与帮助，灭虫工作日夜不停，风雨不止，异常积极，并得到了不少成绩。如徐水县一区伙王店一天之中，采摘虫卵六百四十六斤；丰润县十区全川院二百二十名妇女十天把一千二百九十亩庄稼打了三遍虫，固县七天突击，捕灭豆虫一万一千五百多斤，全县保住庄稼十三万零一百七十八亩。上述成绩，又与动员起来的群众数字有着密切的关系，根据不完全的统计，丰润县仅三十二个村，捕虫的妇女儿童有二千五百余人；固县七天中发动起来五万七千七十余人；宁晋五个区一天当中，有三万四千余人参加捕虫。现在有的地区虫害已经扑灭，有的地区尚在全力捕打。此次灭虫运动中，还有着一些缺点，一般地区首先是防虫工作注意不够，多是发现了虫害之后才组织扑打（这点，南宫作得比较好，南宫县在虫害未发生前，即曾指示各区深入检查，及时防止，当各地发现虫卵后，立刻展开剪虫卵叶运动，很快就扑灭了虫害）；其次不深入群众动员启发，仍存强迫命令作风，工作粗枝大叶，未将虫害彻底消除，广大妇女儿童未能大力发动，都是大部受灾地区的工作缺点。
