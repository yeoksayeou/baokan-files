Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 16th: The Hungarian people's trial of spies and traitors like Rajk has been met with attention and support from the people of Beijing, Tianjin, and other places. Newspapers in Beijing and Tianjin have published this news in prominent positions. The Beijing People's Daily published it on the front page with the headline "People's Democratic Dictatorship Unprecedentedly Consolidated; Hungarian Government Smashes Treacherous Conspiracy." The Democratic League's newspaper headline was "Consolidate the People's Democratic Regime, Smash the US Imperialist Aggression Conspiracy."

Major newspapers in Beijing and Tianjin have published commentaries on this matter. The Beijing People's Daily published an editorial entitled "Spies and Traitors Cannot Be Forgiven," stating: The Hungarian State Prosecutor's Office's prosecution of the Rajk and other spy treason cases under the instructions of US imperialism and the Tito clique is not only to defend Hungary's people's democratic system, but also a great victory in the world people's struggle to defend peace and democracy. This further educates the people of all countries to be more politically vigilant, and in the struggle to unite all revolutionary forces against imperialism and domestic reactionaries, to expose and punish counter-revolutionaries and espionage saboteurs who collude with imperialism, betray the motherland, and oppose the people's democratic cause at any time.

The Beijing Guangming Daily's commentary stated: The Rajk case is a lesson for the Hungarian people, a lesson for all people's democratic countries, and a lesson for all peace-loving people in the world. US imperialism and its pawns are using various conspiracies and tricks to subvert the governments of people's democratic countries in order to enslave the people of these countries. This precisely illustrates that the dictatorship of the people's democratic countries against reactionaries and national traitors is necessary and absolutely essential.

The Tianjin Daily commented: The cracking of this treacherous conspiracy case, like the previous cases of Hungarian Bishop Mindszenty, Bulgarian pastors, and the American spy case in Shenyang, China, once again exposes the extreme hatred and malicious conspiracies of US imperialism against the liberated people. After this conspiracy is cracked, Hungary's people's democratic regime will be further consolidated, and at the same time, it will also arouse greater vigilance against the enemy in the peace camp.

The Tianjin Progress Daily said: The US imperialist conspiracy to collude with reactionaries to cause trouble has been fully exposed due to the exposure of the Rajk treason case. The exposure of the Rajk treason case gives a serious lesson to all national traitors who obey US imperialism and sell out the people, and also gives the US imperialists a considerable lesson.

　　中国人民痛斥美帝铁托阴谋
  　拥护匈政府审判叛逆
    【新华社北平十六日电】匈牙利人民对间谍叛国分子拉伊克等人的审判受到北平、天津等地人民的重视和拥护。平津等地报纸都以显著地位刊登此项消息，北平人民日报刊登在首页头条地位，并冠以“人民民主专政空前巩固，匈政府粉碎叛国阴谋”的标题。民主同盟机关报的标题是“巩固人民民主政权，粉碎美帝国主义侵略阴谋”。
    平津各重要报纸都对此发表了评论。北平人民日报以“不能饶恕间谍叛国分子”为题发表社论说：匈牙利国家检察署对于在美帝国主义与铁托集团指示下的拉伊克等间谍叛国案提起公诉，这不仅是为了保卫匈牙利的人民民主制度，而且是在世界人民保卫和平民主斗争中的一个伟大胜利。这进一步地教育了各国人民在政治上更加提高警惕，在团结一切革命力量反对帝国主义及国内反动派的斗争中，对于勾结帝国主义、背叛祖国、反对人民民主事业的反革命分子及间谍破坏分子，必须随时予以揭发和惩处。
    北平光明日报的评论说：拉伊克案件是对于匈牙利人民的一种教训，是对于一切人民民主国家的一种教训，也是对于全世界和平人民的一种教训。美帝国主义及其爪牙们正以各种阴谋诡计企图颠覆人民民主国家的政府，以奴役这些国家的人民，这正是说明了人民民主国家对于反动派和卖国叛徒的专政，是必要的，而且是绝对必要的。
    天津日报评论说：这件阴谋叛国案的破获，和以往的匈牙利主教明曾蒂案、保加利亚牧师案和我国沈阳的美国特务案一样，再度暴露了美帝国主义对于解放了的人民的极端仇视和恶毒阴谋。这个阴谋破获后，匈牙利人民民主政权将进一步巩固，同时，也将引起和平阵营中对敌人的更严重的警惕。
    天津进步日报说：美帝国主义勾结反动派捣乱的阴谋，由于拉伊克叛国案的揭露，而被合盘托出了。拉伊克叛国案的揭露，给一切听命美帝国主义和出卖人民的国贼们一个严重的教训，也给美帝国主义者一个不小的教训。
