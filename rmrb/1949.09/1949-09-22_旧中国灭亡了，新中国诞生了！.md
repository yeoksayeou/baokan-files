　　The old China is dead, the new China is born!
    The opening of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference is the beginning of a glorious and brilliant new century for the people. This is an unprecedented conference of great unity of all the Chinese people. This conference declared the eternal demise of the old China and the great birth of the new China. This conference is a significant and indelible contribution to the great struggle of progressive humanity around the world for world peace, democracy, and a bright future for humanity.
    Under the great banner of the new democratic revolution, or people's democratic revolution, against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, led by the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, the leader of the Chinese people, the Chinese people have become increasingly united and have formed a people's democratic united front, carrying out unprecedented, indomitable, and heroic struggles. After defeating Japanese imperialism in the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan, the Chinese people essentially defeated the Kuomintang reactionaries armed by American imperialism in just three years of the Liberation War, ending the period of imperialist, feudal, and bureaucratic capitalist rule in China, and continuing to advance the Chinese People's Liberation War and the Chinese People's Revolutionary Movement towards complete victory throughout the country. The Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, convened on this basis, includes representatives from all democratic parties, people's organizations, the People's Liberation Army, various regions, various ethnic groups, overseas Chinese, and other patriotic and democratic individuals, will concentrate the will of the people of the whole country, declare the establishment of the People's Republic of China, formulate its own charter, and organize its own central government.
    The people of the whole country have long yearned for a People's Political Consultative Conference like this, truly run by the people themselves. The people of the whole country vividly remember that the Political Consultative Conference held in January 1946 was sabotaged by the Kuomintang reactionaries. The Kuomintang reactionaries and their supporters, American imperialism, taking the Chinese people as deceivable, tore up all the agreements they had signed with their own hands in front of the people, launched a counter-revolutionary war, cruelly opposed the Chinese people, and convened a divisive and dictatorial pseudo-"National Assembly,"妄想为所欲为。 But on May 1, 1948, just as the pseudo-"National Assembly" concluded, the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, representing the wishes of the people of the whole country, issued a slogan on the current situation, calling on all democratic parties, people's organizations, and democratic individuals to quickly convene a new political consultative conference and establish a democratic coalition government. This great call, in coordination with the advancement of the People's Liberation War and the People's Democratic Movement, immediately received enthusiastic responses from all democratic parties, people's organizations, and patriotic democratic individuals at home and abroad. Today, we have finally seen the People's Liberation War and the People's Democratic Movement victoriously defeat the Kuomintang reactionaries and victoriously convene the people's own Political Consultative Conference. This is a great victory that has turned the world upside down.
    From that old Political Consultative Conference three years ago to today's Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, two fundamentally different historical periods have been divided. The historical facts of these short three years have demonstrated, for the last time, the ferocious and evil nature of China's big landlords and big bourgeoisie, and proved that the only way out for the Chinese people is to carry out a people's revolution under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, overthrow the counter-revolutionary rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, and establish their own People's Republic of China. Three years of history have proven this truth so vividly and richly, that the Chinese people have universally recognized this truth through their own experience. This ensures that the reactionary old China will inevitably perish forever, and the people's new China will inevitably win forever. This also determines that the new state system that the Chinese people want to establish must be a state system of people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class, based on the worker-peasant alliance, and uniting all democratic classes and all ethnic groups in the country. With this state system, we will be able to guarantee the great achievements of the victory of the Chinese People's Democratic Revolution; with this state system, we will have the strength to crush at any time the conspiracies of imperialism, feudalism, bureaucratic capitalism, and all reactionary forces to attempt to restore their rule in China. The power of this country is the power of the democratic united front of the four classes in the Chinese People's Democratic Revolution—the working class, the peasant class, the petty bourgeoisie, and the national bourgeoisie—and other patriotic elements, and is the power to exercise dictatorship over the enemies of the Chinese people—imperialism, feudalism, bureaucratic capitalism, and other counter-revolutionary remnants. The Chinese people have been able to obtain such a state system and form of power of the people's democratic dictatorship through the successive sacrifices and struggles of countless revolutionary martyrs for nearly a hundred years, especially through the heroic struggles of the Chinese Communist Party for twenty-eight years and the arduous battles of the Chinese People's Liberation Army for twenty-two years. The Chinese people have paid a great price in sacrifice in order to seek and create such a state system and form of power, so the Chinese people must carry the revolution through to the end, must adhere to the people's democratic dictatorship, and actively participate in the big family of all peace-loving and free nations in the world, resolutely lean to one side, and unite closely with all peace-loving and free countries and people in the world, first of all, unite closely with the Soviet Union and all new democratic countries, jointly smash any provocations of the imperialist warmongers, defend lasting world peace, and continue to strive forward for the thorough completion of the Chinese People's Democratic Revolution and for the common and beautiful future of the Chinese and world people.
    The historical tasks to be completed by the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference are extremely important, but the Chinese people and their representatives, who have already achieved great victory, will certainly be able to complete these tasks. From now on, people all over the world will see the Chinese people stand up with unprecedented heroic姿态 and become the glorious masters of a new society and a new country with a high degree of civilization.

### 旧中国灭亡了，新中国诞生了！

　　旧中国灭亡了，新中国诞生了！
    中国人民政治协商会议的开幕，是中国光辉灿烂的人民的新世纪的开端。这是全中国人民空前大团结的会议。这个会议宣告了旧中国的永远灭亡和新中国的伟大诞生。这个会议，在全世界进步人类为世界和平民主事业与人类美好的未来而进行的伟大斗争中，是一个具有重大意义的永远不可磨灭的贡献。
    在中国共产党和中国人民领袖毛泽东主席所领导的反对帝国主义、封建主义及官僚资本主义的新民主主义革命即人民民主革命的伟大旗帜之下，中国人民日益坚强地团结起来，结成了人民民主统一战线，进行了史无前例的不屈不挠的英勇斗争。继八年抗日战争打倒了一个日本帝国主义之后，仅仅在三年的解放战争中，中国人民就已经基本上打倒了由美帝国主义所武装起来的国民党反动派，结束了帝国主义、封建主义及官僚资本主义在中国的统治时期，并将中国人民解放战争和中国人民革命运动继续推进向全国的彻底胜利。在这个基础上所召开的包括全国所有的民主党派、人民团体、人民解放军、各地区、各民族、国外华侨及其他爱国民主分子的代表人物的中国人民政治协商会议，就要集中全国人民的意志，宣告中华人民共和国的成立，制定中国人民自己的宪章，组织中国人民自己的中央政府。
    全国人民早已渴望着召开这样的一个真正由人民自己做主人的人民政治协商会议。全国人民都鲜明地记得，在一九四六年一月间所举行的政治协商会议是被国民党反动派所破坏了。国民党反动派及其支持者美国帝国主义，以中国人民为可欺，撕毁了它们在人民面前亲手所签订的一切协定，发动反革命的战争，残酷地反对中国人民，召集了分裂的独裁的伪“国大”，妄想为所欲为。但在一九四八年的五月一日，正当伪“国大”完结的那一天，中国共产党中央，代表着全国人民的愿望，发出了对时局的口号，号召各民主党派、各人民团体、各民主人士，迅速召开新的政治协商会议，成立民主联合政府。这一伟大的号召，配合着人民解放战争和人民民主运动的前进，立即得到全国各民主党派、各人民团体和国内外爱国民主人士的热烈响应。我们今天终于看到了人民解放战争和人民民主运动胜利地打倒了国民党反动派，胜利地召开了人民自己的政治协商会议。这是一个翻天覆地的伟大胜利。
    从三年前的那个旧的政治协商会议到今天这个中国人民政治协商会议，划分了两个根本不同的历史时期。这短短三年间的历史事实，最后一次证明了中国的大地主大资产阶级的穷凶极恶，证明了中国人民的唯一出路，就是在中国共产党领导之下举行人民革命，推翻帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义的反革命统治，而建立自己的中华人民共和国。三年的历史，把这个真理证明得如此生动而丰富，使中国人民普遍地经过自己的经验认识了这个真理。这就保证了反动派的旧中国必然永远灭亡，而人民的新中国必然永远胜利。这也就决定了中国人民所要建立的新的国家制度，必须是以工人阶级为领导的，以工农联盟为基础的，团结各民主阶级和国内各民族的人民民主专政的国家制度。有了这个国家制度，我们就能够保障中国人民民主革命胜利的伟大成果；有了这个国家制度，我们就有力量随时击碎帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义及一切反动势力在中国企图复辟的阴谋。这个国家的政权，是中国人民民主革命中的四个阶级——工人阶级、农民阶级、小资产阶级、民族资产阶级和其他爱国分子的民主统一战线的政权，是对于中国人民的敌人——帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义及其他反革命残余势力实行专政的政权。中国人民能够得到这样一个人民民主专政的国家制度和政权形式，是经过了近一百年无数革命先烈前仆后继牺牲奋斗而来的，特别是经过了中国共产党二十八年的英勇斗争和中国人民解放军二十二年的艰苦奋战而来的。中国人民为了寻求和创造这样的国家制度和政权形式，已经付出了极大的牺牲代价，因此中国人民必须把革命进行到底，必须坚持人民民主专政，并积极参加到世界爱好和平自由的各民族的大家庭之中，坚决地一边倒，与全世界一切爱好和平自由的国家和人民团结在一起，首先是和苏联及各新民主国家亲密地团结在一起，共同击碎帝国主义战争贩子们任何的挑衅，保卫世界的持久和平，为彻底完成中国人民民主革命并为中国和世界人民共同的美好的未来而继续奋斗前进。
    中国人民政治协商会议所要完成的历史任务是极为重大的，但是，已经取得了伟大胜利的中国人民及其代表是一定能够完成这些任务的。从此，全世界的人都将看到中国人民以空前英勇的姿态站起来，成为有高度文明的新社会新国家的光荣的主人。
