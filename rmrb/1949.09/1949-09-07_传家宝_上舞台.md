"Heirloom" on Stage
    Xiang Qing
    Comrade Zhao Shuli's "Heirloom" has been adapted for the stage by the collective of the Hebei-Central 11th District Committee's Literary and Art Work Troupe.
    "Heirloom," because it reflects the lives of peasants after liberation, is a new era, a new countryside, and new characters sweeping away the old, feudal, and backward remnants left over by the feudal class. Precisely because of this, coupled with the fact that the comrades of the art troupe personally experienced this life, the performance of this play has won the praise of the peasants and achieved a certain effect. Therefore, the following points are reflected in the play "Heirloom":
    (1) The new is developing, the old is being discarded: The old lady in the play "Heirloom" fully represents conservatism, feudalism, backwardness, and regression. She wants to keep women locked in the house, she wants to drag the era back (although she knows that emancipation is good), she attempts to use her "heirloom" — a broken box, needle and thread, an old spinning wheel — to replace new things — cooperatives, mutual aid groups, village representative meetings... and so on.
    (2) Labor is the foundation of women's emancipation: Now women are liberated. In this play, Jin Gui (the old lady's daughter-in-law) is a typical example of an emancipated woman. She is a labor model, and she knows that women's emancipation and the improvement of their status must be consolidated by labor. If women are merely emancipated but do not participate in major labor, then that emancipation is not thorough, and they must stand on the production front like men.
    (3) We see the prospects for new rural construction: When mentioning the characteristics of peasants: conservatism, narrow-mindedness, but we should know that these characteristics are changing after the land reform, with the construction of a new democratic society, and with our transition from agriculture to industrialization. We deeply understand this point from "Heirloom."
    The old lady is nostalgic for the old way of life and dissatisfied with "mutual aid groups," but her children tell her that life will get better day by day in the future, and that machines will be used to cultivate the land. The story of "Heirloom" clearly points out that China will move from backward technology to agricultural industrialization.

### “传家宝”上舞台

　　“传家宝”上舞台
    向青 
    赵树理同志的“传家宝”，已由冀中十一分区地委文艺工作团集体改编后搬上了舞台。
    “传家宝”由于它所反映的是解放后的农民生活，是新的时代新的农村新的人物扫除了封建阶级遗留下来底陈旧的、封建的、落后的残余。正因为这，再加上文工团同志亲身体验了这种生活，所以这剧的演出得到了农民的赞扬，收到了一定的效果。因此从“传家宝”一剧中反映了下列几点：
    （一）新的在发展，旧的在被抛弃：“传家宝”剧中的老太太是充分的代表着保守、封建、落后、倒退。她想把女人们关在屋里，她想把时代拖回去（虽然她知道翻身好），她企图用她的“传家宝”——破箱、针线＠箩、旧纺车代替新的事物——合作社、互助组、村代会……等等。
    （二）劳动是妇女翻身的基础：如今妇女解放了，在这个剧中金桂（老太太的儿媳妇）是翻身妇女的典型，她是劳动模范，她知道妇女翻身与得到地位的提高必须由劳动来巩固。如果只是劳妇女翻身，但不参加主要嚷动，那翻身是不澈底的，而她们是同男人一样站到生产战线上了。
    （三）我们看见了新农村建设的远景：提到农民的特性：是保守、狭隘，但我们应知道这种特性是在土地改革后，随着新民主主义社会的建设而改变，随着我们由农业走向工业化而改变，从“传家宝”中我们深刻的了解到了这点。
    老太太留恋于旧的生活方式，不满意“互助组”，而她的儿女们却告诉她，将来一天生活要比一天好，而且要用机器来耕地的。“传家宝”这一故事，很明显的指出中国将由落后的技术走向农业工业化。
