　　Communist Party of the Free Territory of Trieste
　  Yesterday Held Second Party Congress
    Will Elect Party's Central Committee and Supervisory Committee
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 16th] Trieste Dispatch: The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Free Territory of Trieste decided to convene its Second Congress from the 16th to the 18th. The party's General Secretary, Vittorio Vidali, will deliver a political report, and Alessandro Testrata will deliver an organizational report. The congress will elect the party's Central Committee and Supervisory Committee, and discuss issues such as the struggle for proletarian internationalism and the life of communist youth.
    The Communist Party of the Free Territory of Trieste has recently achieved important victories in two consecutive struggles. In the town elections in June, the Communist Party won 45,000 votes, demonstrating the party's enormous strength. Furthermore, in the struggle against Tito's Trotskyites in Trieste, the enemy suffered a great defeat. Due to the resolute struggle of the Communist Party, the US-British imperialists and the Tito clique hurriedly launched a joint offensive, forcing the suspension of publication of the Communist Party of the Free Territory of Trieste's newspaper, "Il Lavoratore."
