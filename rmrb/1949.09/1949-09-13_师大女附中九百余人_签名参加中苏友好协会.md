　　[Reported by this newspaper] The Chinese Communist Party General Branch, Communist Youth League, Student Union, Faculty and Staff Union, and Workers' Union of the Girls' High School Affiliated to Beijing Normal University jointly convened a school-wide meeting to support the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association at 4:00 PM on the 7th of this month, presided over by the CCP General Branch. Over 1,200 people, including all students, faculty, staff, and workers, attended. First, Principal Peng Wen gave a systematic report on Sino-Soviet issues to all attendees. Subsequently, students, faculty, staff, and workers enthusiastically spoke, unanimously expressing their ardent support for Sino-Soviet friendship, believing that the Soviet Union is our good friend and teacher. Only through the unity of the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union can the victory of the Chinese revolution and the success of construction be guaranteed. Finally, a signing took place to apply to join the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association. Registration forms were immediately snatched up, and to date, 964 people have signed up. The signing is still in progress.
