　　Strengthened Our Confidence
    ——After Watching "Million Soldiers Cross the Yangtze"
    Feng Zi
    "Million Soldiers Cross the Yangtze." There is no story, no central character, but the audience will see in this documentary that after the Kuomintang reactionaries rejected the peace proposal put forward by the Chinese Communist Party, our heroic People's Liberation Army, on April 21st, received the order from Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu and bravely crossed the Yangtze River on the 22nd. On the approximately thousand-mile-long bank of the river, ten thousand sailboats set off simultaneously. The boat owners and their wives were calmly rowing, smiling kindly and concernedly at the soldiers who were like their own nephews; the soldiers were excitedly and vigilantly watching the front, holding machine guns; the engineers were helping to paddle forward with shovels. The enemy's artillery and bullets rained down on the Yangtze River, while the power of the people's artillery protected the people's soldiers, allowing them to sail safely to the opposite bank. In just one day and night, the "natural barrier of the Yangtze River" boasted by the Kuomintang reactionaries was completely destroyed by the power of the people.
    In the liberation of the vast Jiangnan area, the soldiers who crossed the river victoriously joined forces with the guerrillas who persisted behind enemy lines in Jiangnan. The guerrillas in black clothes and trousers warmly shook hands with the liberated soldiers, caressing each other's weapons. The young, people's soldiers converged together. What a difficult journey! This is a magnificent picture and a great poem!
    In Hangzhou, young male and female students, hearing the news of the People's Liberation Army entering the city, ran out in groups to meet them. The West Lake, which had been sleeping for decades, also woke up from the people's singing. The beautiful lake and mountains will forever belong to the people themselves.
    Ridiculously, the enemy in Shanghai was still daydreaming, frantically carrying out a policy of terror: arresting, killing, and sabotaging, painting themselves with lines of unforgivable blood debts. But the workers heroically armed themselves and launched factory protection work.
    Finally, we saw Shanghai, the first great city in Asia, which had been divided by imperialism and oppressed and ruled by the comprador bourgeoisie for a hundred years, finally stand up forever under the armed forces of the people.
    The whole of China will stand up forever. "Million Soldiers Cross the Yangtze" reveals this truth and further strengthens our faith.

　　坚定了我们的信心
    ——“百万雄师下江南”观后
    凤子
    “百万雄师下江南”。没有故事，没有中心的人物，可是，观众们会在这部记录片中看得出自从国民党反动派拒绝了中国共产党提出的和平方案以后，我们英勇的人民解放军，于四月二十一日奉到毛主席朱总司令的命令即在二十二日就奋勇地渡过了长江。在长约千里的江岸线上，万艘帆船，同时出发，船老板和老板娘们那样沉着地摇着橹，慈蔼而关切地笑望着自己底子侄一样的战士们；战士们兴奋而机警地注视着前方，握着机枪；工兵们用铁锹帮着划向前去。敌人的大炮和枪弹雨雹样散落在长江里，同时人民炮手的威力却掩护着人民的战士们安稳地航驶到对岸。只一日夜的工夫，国民党反动派夸耀的“长江天险”，却被人民的力量全部摧毁了。
    在广大的江南地区解放中，渡江的战士和在江南坚持敌后的游击队胜利的会师了。全身黑衣裤的游击队员同解放战士热烈的握手，彼此抚摩着对方的武器，年青的，人民的战士们汇流在一起了，多么艰辛的一段历程呵！这是一幅雄伟的画图，也是一首伟大的诗篇！
    在杭州，青年的男女学生们，听到解放军入城的消息，成群的奔跑着，迎向前去。沉睡了几十年的西子湖也从人民的欢唱声中醒了，美丽的湖山将永远为人民自己所有了。
    可笑，上海的敌人还在做着白日梦，正在疯狂地进行恐怖政策：逮捕、屠杀、破坏，给他们自己涂下一行行难以饶恕的血债罪行。可是工人们却英勇地武装起来展开了护厂工作。
    最后，我们看到百年来被帝国主义分割了的，被官僚买办资产阶级压迫统治的亚洲第一个大城上海，终于在人民的武装力量下永远的站了起来。
    全中国将永远的站了起来，“百万雄师下江南”昭示了这个真理，也更坚定了我们的信念。
