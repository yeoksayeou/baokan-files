　　Private Industry in Beiping Under the Support of State-Owned Trading Companies
　　Xiao Disheng Wang Jing
　　"Before liberation, our industry was subjected to the aggression of imperialism and the oppression of bureaucratic capitalism, and could not develop and survive. After liberation, under the guidance and support of the People's Government, under the new democratic industrial construction policy, it can be freely developed." This is the slogan of the private Huaxing Weaving and Dyeing Factory in Beiping at the industrial exhibition, and it is also a true reflection of the contrast between private enterprises in Beiping before and after liberation. In order to implement the policy of "both public and private interests, developing production," state-owned trading companies have vigorously supported private factories that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood since liberation, so that the stalled machines can be turned on.
　　There are several ways for trading companies to support the production of private industries, including supplying raw materials, purchasing finished products, exchanging raw materials for finished products, and processing and manufacturing. Statistics for the past six months (from March to the end of August) show that more than 97,700 bolts of various fabrics, more than 85,200 dozens of towels, more than 96,900 dozens of socks, more than 93,000 jin of iron pots, more than 12,800 dozens of vests and shirts, and more than 21,800 pieces of other cotton textiles (such as blankets) were exchanged; more than 17.79 million jin of flour, more than 24.16 million jin of coarse grains were processed and manufactured, more than 52,000 bolts of various colored fabrics were dyed, more than 9,175 bundles of combined thread, and more than 92,000 jin of vermicelli and starch; more than 13,300 boxes of soap, more than 2,495 boxes of matches, more than 14,700 dozens of sanitary products, and more than 138,000 strips of cigarettes were purchased, in addition to a large number of paper, stationery, rubber, carpets, etc. The raw materials supplied for industrial production include more than 162,900 bundles of cotton yarn (including 100,500 bundles directly exchanged), more than 237,700 jin of tobacco leaves, more than 5,120 jin of vulcanized green, more than 486,600 jin of alkali, and more than 86,600 tons of coal.
　　Among the more than 460 weaving and dyeing households in the city (according to statistics in June), 320 have signed contracts with the cotton yarn and cloth branch company to exchange military cloth or have business dealings, accounting for more than 69% of the total; 1,288 knitting households exchange finished products with the department store branch company for raw materials, and there are 9 mechanized flour factories and 138 rice and flour grain businesses that process and manufacture; there are 6 match factories and 9 cigarette factories that have exchange or ordering relationships, in addition to various industries such as printing, papermaking, rubber, and toothbrushes, totaling 1,942.
　　Judging from the above figures, the support of trading companies has played a certain role in the process of the development of private industries in Beiping from shutdown to start-up, and from a few to more.
　　However, in the process of supporting industrial production, trading companies do not have enough understanding of the production and sales of industrial products in Beiping, and lack planning, which has led to some blind phenomena. For example, when the method of exchanging cotton yarn for finished products was used to support the knitting industry in April, neither was an in-depth market survey conducted, nor was the profit of the knitting industry thoroughly studied. It was blindly stipulated that one bundle of cotton yarn (140 taels) could be exchanged for 90 taels of colored socks or 98 taels of towels. This allowed knitting households to obtain a high profit of 10 to 20 taels of cotton yarn per bundle. In addition, the loans from the business department of the cooperative bank further stimulated the blind increase in production. As a result, the number of socks exchanged was more than 1,400 dozens in April, which increased to more than 15,000 dozens in May, and more than 41,000 dozens were exchanged by June 25; however, the quality of the products decreased due to the unlimited purchase by the trading company, and the cost increased accordingly. Therefore, they could not compete with Tianjin and Shanghai goods in the city market, and were not welcomed by farmers in the countryside because they were not durable. Only more than 7,000 dozens were sold in April, May, and June (most of which were transferred to trading companies in Suiyuan-Mongolia, Beiyue, and eastern Hebei through the General Trade). Moreover, Beiping had very few ribbed socks and striped towels needed in the Northeast (Beiping mostly had plain socks and white towels), which made the production and supply out of balance and made it difficult to open up sales channels. The same phenomenon also occurred in the weaving and dyeing industry: for example, the Northeast needed dark-colored striped cloth, but the Beiping Trading Company had a large stock of six-zhang light-striped cloth, which could not be sold in the Northeast, and was more expensive than Gaoyang cloth when sold in various parts of North China. The soap industry also experienced a surplus because of high costs, low quality, and too much purchase by trading companies. As a result, a lot of funds were accumulated, which affected the expansion of reproduction.
　　Since June, trading companies have begun to correct the above deviations. On the one hand, they have sent people to the Northwest, Northeast, central Hebei, and other places to investigate market needs and promote various stockpiled goods; on the other hand, they have accepted experience, improved quality, reduced costs (reduced exchange rates), rectified Zhuangkou, and created brands to suit sales channels. In order to take care of the producers, the cotton yarn and cloth branch company and the department store branch company purchased the stockpiled or currently produced unsalable goods when changing Zhuangkou (but because the planning was not thorough before changing Zhuangkou, some factories suffered losses); at the same time, new contracts were ordered, requiring the production of new standard products, changing striped cloth to military cloth (weighing 12 pounds, 110 feet long, and 2.75 feet wide white cloth), and changing short-waisted plain socks to high-waisted ribbed socks. Moreover, some unsalable striped cloths were made into shirts for sale to actively open up sales channels.
　　The support of trading companies for private industrial production has gradually moved from a detour to the right track. For example, military cloth is durable and very suitable for market sales after adding color; checkered towels are sold to Jilin and western Liaoning in the Northeast, and are welcomed by the masses. However, the sales volume of socks that were stockpiled in the past is still not large. These all prove that: Beiping's industry can only have new outlets if it develops by improving quality and reducing costs.
　　In the future, the cotton yarn and cloth company and the department store branch company should further combine with the bank cooperative to support and organize private industries on the existing basis, strengthen production guidance, overcome the somewhat laissez-faire state in the past, establish normal relations with private industrialists, grasp reasonable and appropriate normal profits, and actively promote finished products to various places and purchase raw materials (at present, there are occasional cases of untimely supply of raw materials) to develop industrial production and promote the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas; at the same time, private factories should use an honest attitude to carefully study how to improve quality and reduce costs, change the past bad habits of cutting corners, do not rely on trading companies, and take the initiative to find markets and open up sales channels to pave a road for the development of Beiping's industry.

　　在国营贸易公司扶助下的北平私营工业
    萧涤生　王敬
    “解放前，我们的工业，外受帝国主义的侵略，内有官僚资本的压迫，不得发展与生存；解放后，在新民主主义工业建设方针下，经人民政府的领导与扶植，能得到自由发展。”这是北平私营华兴织染厂在工业展览会中的标语，也正是北平私营企业解放前后对比的写真。国营贸易公司为贯彻“公私兼顾，发展生产”的政策，从解放后，便大力扶植有利于国计民生的各私营工厂，使停顿的机器动转起来。
    贸易公司扶植私营工业生产的方式，有供给原料、收购成品、以原料换成品及加工制造等数种。统计半年来（由三月份至八月底止）交换各种布匹九万七千七百余匹，毛巾八万五千二百余打，线袜九万六千九百余打，铁锅九万三千余斤，背心衬衣一万二千八百余打，其他棉织品（如线毯等）二万一千八百余件；加工制造面粉一千七百七十九万余斤，粗粮二千四百一十六万余斤，染各色布五万二千余匹，合线九千一百七十五捆，粉条、淀粉九万二千余斤；收购肥皂一万三千三百余箱，火柴二千四百九十五箱，卫生用具一万四千七百余打，纸烟十三万八千余条，另外还有大批纸张、文具、橡胶、地毯等。供给工业生产原料，计有棉纱十六万二千九百余捆（内直接交换者十万零五千捆），烟叶二十三万七千七百余斤，硫化青五千一百二十余斤，碱面四十八万六千余斤，煤炭八万六千余吨。
    按全市织染业四百六十余户（据六月份统计）中，有三百二十家与花纱布分公司订有交换军布合同或有业务往来，占总数的百分之六十九强；针织业有一千二百八十八户以成品与百货分公司交换原料，加工制造者有机制面粉工厂九家，米面粮业一百三十八家；有交换或订货关系的火柴厂六家，纸烟厂九家，此外还有印刷、造纸、橡胶、牙刷等各种工业合计共一千九百四十二家。
    从以上数字中看，北平私营工业的从停工到开工，从少数而增多的发展过程中，贸易公司的扶植，是起了一定作用的。
    不过，贸易公司在扶植工业生产当中，对北平工业品的产销情况了解不够，缺乏计划，以致曾发生过某些盲目现象。例如在四月份开始以棉纱交换成品方式来扶植针织业时，既未深入调查市场，亦未切实研究针织业的利润，盲目的规定棉纱一捆（一百四十两）换色袜九十两或毛巾九十八两，这样就使针织业户每捆纱可获得十两至二十两棉纱的高额利润，再加以合作银行营业部的贷款，更刺激了生产量的盲目增加，因之换入袜子数目四月份为一千四百余打，五月份即增至一万五千余打，六月份截至二十五日止即换入了四万一千余打；而产品质量则因贸易公司无限制的收购而降低，成本则因之增加，于是在城内市场上不能与津、沪货竞争，到乡村又因其不坚固而不受农民欢迎，四、五、六三个月中仅销出七千余打（大半都是通过贸总转运到绥蒙、北岳、冀东等地贸易公司）。而东北需要的罗口袜子、条格毛巾，北平又很少（北平多系平口袜子、白毛巾），这样使生产供需失调，销路很难打开；同样在织染业也发生了这种现象：如东北需要深色条布，而北平贸易公司大批积存的都是六丈浅条布，在东北不能推销，在华北各地推销，又较高阳布价格高。肥皂业也因成本高，质量低，贸易公司收购太多，而发生过剩现象。这样，压积许多资金，影响了扩大再生产。
    从六月份起，贸易公司开始纠正了以上这些偏向，一方面派人赴西北、东北、冀中等地调查市场需要情况，并推销各种存积货品；另方面接受经验，提高品质，减低成本（降低交换比率），整顿庄口，创立牌号，以适合销路。为了照顾生产者，在改变时，花纱布分公司和百货分公司收购了积存的或正在生产的冷货（但因改变庄口时，事前计划不周，以致有个别工厂曾遭受损失）；同时又订制新合同，要求生产新标准的产品，改织条布为军布（重十二磅，长一百一十尺，宽二尺七寸五的白布），改织短腰平口袜为高腰罗口袜。并且将一些滞销的条布，制成衬衣出售，积极打开销路。
    贸易公司扶植私营工业生产，已渐渐由弯路走向正轨，如军布品质坚固耐久，加色后，很适合市场实销；方格毛巾销往东北的吉林、辽西等地，受到群众的欢迎。而过去积压的袜子销售量仍不大，这些都证明着：北平工业，只有在提高品质，减低成本上发展，才能有新的出路。
    今后，花纱布公司与百货分公司更应结合银行合作社，在现有的基础上扶植与组织私营工业，加强生产指导，克服过去某种程度上的自流状态，与私营工业家建立正常关系，掌握合理适当的正常利润，并积极向各地推销成品，采购原料（目前有时发生原料供给不及时现象），以发展工业生产，促进城乡物资交流；同时，各私营工厂，更应以老实态度在提高质量、减低成本上用心研究，改变过去某种偷工减料的恶习，勿存依赖贸易公司的心理，要主动地去寻找市场，打开销路，给北平的工业铺上一条向前发展的道路。
