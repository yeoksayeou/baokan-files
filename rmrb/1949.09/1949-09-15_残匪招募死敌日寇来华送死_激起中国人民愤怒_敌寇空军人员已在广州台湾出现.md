Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 14th - According to reports from various sources: The Kuomintang bandit gang, colluding with MacArthur in Japan, has recruited Japanese air force personnel who have appeared in Guangzhou and Taiwan. This measure by the Kuomintang bandit gang to heavily employ the deadly enemy Japanese to carry out a desperate struggle has aroused the national indignation of the broad masses of the Chinese people. Many Chinese newspapers have published such news in prominent positions. The Shanghai Wenhui Daily reported on the 6th in a Guangzhou dispatch that after Wu Tiecheng met with MacArthur in Japan, he recruited 300 Japanese air force personnel in Japan. A portion of them have appeared in Guangzhou since August 16th, while the majority remain in Taiwan. These Japanese aviators were originally Japanese "Kamikaze pilots" (i.e., suicide pilots) and have received new training from the United States after the war. According to a message from Taiwan carried by the Shanghai Ta Kung Pao on August 29th, most of the Kuomintang air force personnel in Taiwan are Japanese pilots sent by MacArthur, and the Taichung Air Force Base is full of these Japanese aviators. The United States news agency, the Associated Press, Tokyo, on the 12th, confirmed the criminal plan of the Kuomintang bandit gang to recruit Japanese air force personnel. The telegram quoted "a certain anonymous well-informed source" as saying: "Two hundred Japanese air force 'volunteers' have gathered in Taiwan, preparing to participate in the war against the Chinese Communists. This person claimed: Most of the 'volunteers' obtained passports to Taiwan under the guise of sugar engineers. They traveled to Taiwan either by small fishing boats or by China Airlines flights. He said: This group of Japanese pilots is currently led by Kagamiyama Taro, a former Japanese pilot of the Central China Aviation Corporation, and is attached to Chiang Kai-shek's air force." The telegram also revealed that Chiang Kai-shek had formulated a plan to recruit Japanese aviators to come to China to participate in the war as early as April this year when he was in Hangzhou, and later Chiang allocated 1.2 million US dollars as funds for the plan. The Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang knew that the Japanese they recruited would only be sent to their deaths in China, so they paid a high price to buy the lives of the Japanese. According to the aforementioned plan quoted by the Associated Press: Each employed Japanese pilot receives a monthly salary of 40,000 yen, and if they are killed in flight, their family will receive a pension of 1.5 million yen.

　　残匪招募死敌日寇来华送死
  　激起中国人民愤怒
    敌寇空军人员已在广州台湾出现
    【新华社北平十四日电】据各方消息报道：国民党匪帮勾结麦克阿瑟在日本招募的日本空军人员已在广州及台湾出现。国民党匪帮这种重用死敌日寇进行垂死挣扎的措施，激起广大中国人民的民族义愤。许多中国报纸都在显著地位刊登这类消息。上海文汇报六日载广州通讯称：吴匪铁城在日本见麦克阿瑟后，在日本募得日本空军人员三百人，从八月十六日起已有一部分在广州出现，大部分则留在台湾。这些日本航空员原来都是日寇“神风队员”（即飞行敢死队员），战后又受过美国的新训练。另据上海大公报八月二十九日载台湾来人所谈消息称：现在台湾国民党空军人员中大多数是麦克阿瑟派来的日本飞行员，台中空军基地就充满了这些日本航空员。美国通讯社合众社东京十二日电证实了国民党匪帮招收日本空军人员的罪恶计划。该电引证“某匿名消息灵通人士”的话说：“已有两百名日本空军‘志愿兵’在台湾聚集，准备参加对中共作战。此人士称：大部分‘志愿兵’都以制糖工程师名义获得赴台湾的护照。他们不是乘小渔艇，就是搭中国航空公司班机去到台湾的。他说：这批日本飞行员目前由前日本主办的华中航空公司驾驶员加贺山太郎率领，附设于蒋介石的空军之内。”该电并透露：蒋贼介石今年四月间在杭州时即已制定招募日本航空员来华参战的计划，后来蒋即拨出一千二百万美元作为该计划的资金。蒋介石匪帮明知他们所招募的日本人到中国来只有白白送死的一个下场，所以他们就出很大的价钱去买日本人的性命。据合众社引述的前述计划规定：每一被雇佣的日本飞行员每月薪金为四万日元，如在飞行中阵亡，即给其家属一百五十万日元的抚恤金。
