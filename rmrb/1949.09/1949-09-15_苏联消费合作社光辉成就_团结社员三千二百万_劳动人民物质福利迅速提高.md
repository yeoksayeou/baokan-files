　　Brilliant Achievements of the Soviet Consumer Cooperatives
  　Uniting 32 Million Members
    Rapidly Improving the Material Welfare of the Working People
    【Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 14th】Moscow News: Soviet cooperative workers commemorated the 27th International Cooperative Day under the banner of struggling for peace and democracy. Among the ten member countries of the International Cooperative Alliance, the Soviet Consumer Cooperative is the largest organization, uniting 32 million members and possessing more than 28,000 consumer cooperatives. In the year since the 26th International Cooperative Day, the Soviet Consumer Cooperative has achieved even greater successes. It plays an important role in the Soviet national economy, with its trade volume accounting for about 25 percent of the nation's total retail trade. It purchased 40 percent of the national potato reserves, more than one-third of vegetables, three-quarters of eggs, and so on. In January of this year, it had 193,000 retail stores and stalls, and 24,000 public canteens. In rural areas, the trade volume of consumer cooperatives in 1948 increased by 17 percent compared to 1947 (calculated at comparable prices); the quantity of various fabrics, shoes, socks, cloths, kitchen utensils, furniture, glassware, sewing machines, bicycles, and motorcycles sold to rural residents has greatly increased. This year, the trade volume of consumer cooperatives in rural areas will be even greater.
    He Kheluofu, Chairman of the Central Union Committee of Soviet Consumer Cooperatives, pointed out in a conversation: Soviet cooperative workers are constantly expanding all activities of the Soviet Consumer Cooperative in order to further increase trade volume and improve the supply of various high-quality goods to the people.
    He Kheluofu stated: The uninterrupted and rapid development of our country's industrial and agricultural production, the successive reduction of retail prices in state-owned stores and the prices of goods sold by cooperatives and collective farms, the strengthening of the value of the ruble, and the steady improvement of the material welfare of the working people have prepared favorable conditions for the development of Soviet trade. All of this is the result of the wise policies pursued by the Bolshevik Party and the constant concern shown by the Party and Comrade Stalin himself for the welfare of our country's working people.

　　苏联消费合作社光辉成就
  　团结社员三千二百万
    劳动人民物质福利迅速提高
    【新华社北平十四日电】莫斯科讯：苏联合作社工作者在为和平民主而斗争的旗帜下纪念了第二十七届国际合作社节。在国际合作社联盟之十个会员国中，苏联消费合作社是最大的一个组织，它团结了三千二百万社员，而且拥有二万八千多个消费合作社。自从第二十六届国际合作社节以来的一年间，苏联消费合作社已获得了更多的成就。它在苏联国民经济中起着重要作用，其贸易额占全国零售贸易总额的百分之二十五左右。它收买了全国所贮藏的洋芋的百分之四十，蔬菜三分之一以上，蛋四分之三等等。今年一月，它有十九万三千零售店和零售摊，二万四千所公共食堂。在农村，一九四八年消费合作社贸易额比一九四七年（按比较价格计算）增加了百分之十七；卖给农村居民的各种织物、鞋袜、布匹、厨房用具、家具、玻璃器、缝纫机、脚踏车、机器脚踏车等货物的数量已大大增加。今年，消费合作社在农村的贸易额将更大。
    苏联消费合作社中央联合会委员会主席贺何洛夫在谈话时指出：苏联合作社工作者不断扩大苏联消费合作社的一切活动，以进一步增大贸易额、改善对人民的各种优等物品的供应。
    贺何洛夫称：我国工农业生产毫不间断的迅速发展，国营商店零售价格与合作社和集体农场售物价格的陆续下降，增强了卢布的价值，节节提高了劳动人民的物质福利，并为苏联贸易的发展准备了有利条件。所有这一切都是布尔什维克党所奉行的英明的政策及党和斯大林同志本人对我国劳动人民福利表示经常关心的结果。
