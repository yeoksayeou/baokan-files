　　A Few Words Before School Starts
　A Short Commentary from "China Youth" Issue 17

　　The summer vacation is over, and schools at all levels are either already in session or about to begin.

　　In the newly liberated cities, the situation in schools this year is fundamentally different from previous years. Our schools have transformed from schools under Kuomintang rule to schools under the New Democratic regime. The tasks of student work have therefore also undergone a fundamental change. In the past, our primary goal was to destroy the dark rule of American imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. We had to strike, march, and rally, and we could not and should not have asked everyone to settle down and study those poisonous courses. Today, the situation has changed. The overall task of the revolution is to build a New China of people's democracy. Student work should naturally shift from passively destroying the old to actively building the new. The primary task must be studying, reforming the old curriculum content, and engaging in New Democratic learning.

　　In the early days of liberation, it was entirely necessary and appropriate for students to welcome liberation and assist the government. Now that a relatively long time has passed since the liberation of North China and most cities in the Jiangnan region, everyone must focus on the primary task of studying after the summer vacation.

　　In the process of studying, we should prevent two deviations. The first is the misconception that reforming old learning means that one no longer needs to study. This leads to disorganization and a lack of discipline, skipping classes, not reading books, not following study rules, and disregarding teachers. This has happened to varying degrees in several newly liberated cities. Many comrades working in education and student affairs have already noticed this. Places like Beiping have even put forward the slogan "Overcome laxity in learning" to correct it, which is excellent. However, some newly liberated areas have not paid enough attention to this, and this phenomenon still exists. We must continue to pay attention to overcoming it in the future.

　　The second deviation is the misconception that "overcoming laxity in learning" means completely restoring the old order in learning, requiring everyone to study the unreformed old curriculum without any criticism. This makes some Youth League members and activists think, "So, we still have to study dead books as before. What's the point of joining the Youth League?" This is wrong. When we say we must study, we mean studying under New Democratic education. New Democratic education is part of New Democratic culture, which opposes imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism; it is national, democratic, scientific, and popular. In addition to adding new courses in schools, old courses should be examined and studied in accordance with the above principles. For example, to oppose imperialism, we should study modern Chinese history and Western history with new perspectives, and we should also carry out internationalist education. To oppose feudalism, we should oppose feudal content in ancient texts and history courses that glorify imperial genealogies and slander peasant uprisings. This reform work should be carried out actively and cautiously. The People's Government education authorities are actively studying these issues and have already implemented some reforms, such as abolishing some old courses. Teachers and students in all schools also have a responsibility for this reform. Middle school teachers, especially Party members and Youth League members among them, should regard reforming the old curriculum as their important daily work, constantly researching and experimenting in educational practice, and absorbing students' opinions. Students should also submit their opinions to teachers, school authorities, and educational administrative organs. Only through cooperation can we do a good job of reform.

　　I wish the students success in completing this year's study tasks, learning a revolutionary outlook on life, methods of thinking, and acquiring a lot of new knowledge to serve the people!

　　在学校开学前的几句话
　“中国青年”第十七期的一篇小言论
    暑期已经满了，各级学校有的已经开学，有的快要开学了。
    在新解放的城市里，今年开学，学校的情况和往年有了根本不同。我们的学校，已经从国民党统治下的学校，变为新民主主义政权下的学校了。学生工作的任务，因此也就有了根本的改变。在过去，我们主要是摧毁美帝国主义和蒋家匪帮的黑暗统治，我们必须罢课游行，奔走呼号，不能而且不应该提出要大家去安心学习那种有毒的课程内容。今天情况变了，革命的总任务是建设人民民主的新中国，学生工作自然就应该由过去的消极破坏旧的，改为积极建设新的，首要任务，就必须是学习，是改造旧的课程内容，进行新民主主义的学习。
    在解放初期，学生们迎接解放、协助政府工作，那完全是必要的和应该的。现在华北和江南大部分城市解放的时期，已经比较久。暑假开学以后大家必须抓紧学习的首要任务了。
    在学习当中，我们应该防止两种偏向。第一种是，误认为改造旧的学习就是可以不必学习了。于是产生了无组织无纪律现象，课也不上，书也不读，学习规则也不遵守，教师也不管。这在好几个新解放的城市都曾经或多或少的发生过。许多地方作教育工作和学生工作的同志，已经注意到这一点，北平等地还为此提出“克服学习上散漫现象”的口号，纠正了它，这是很好的。但是，还有些新解放区对此注意不够，还有这种现象存在。今后必须继续注意克服。
    第二种偏向，是误以为“克服学习上散漫现象”，就是完全恢复学习上的旧秩序。要大家毫无批判的去学习没有经过改造的旧课程。这样，使一些青年团员和积极分子都会想：“原来还是要照旧读死书，何必参加青年团呢？”这样做是错的。我们说要学习，是说要在新民主主义教育下来学习。新民主主义的教育是新民主主义文化的一部分，是反对帝国主义，反对封建主义，反对官僚资本主义的，是民族的、民主的、是科学的大众的。学校里除去增添新课程以外，旧课程都应依照上述方针加以检查和研究。例如要反对帝国主义，就应该以新观点学习中国近代史和西洋史等功课，还应该进行国际主义的教育。要反对封建主义，就应该反对封建内容的古文和帝王家谱的侮蔑农民起义的历史课程。这种改革工作，应该积极而慎重地来进行。人民政府教育机关已经在积极研究这些问题，并且已经实行了某些改革，象废止了一些旧课程。各校师生对这一改革也都有责任。中学教员们，特别是中学教员中的党员团员们，应当把改革旧课程作为自己的日常重要工作，在教育实践当中，经常研究和试验，并且吸收同学的意见。学生也应该把自己的意见向教员、学校当局和教育行政机关提出。大家合作，才能把改革工作做好。
    敬祝同学们胜利完成这一年的学习任务，学到革命的人生观，思想方法，学到很多为人民服务的新知识！
