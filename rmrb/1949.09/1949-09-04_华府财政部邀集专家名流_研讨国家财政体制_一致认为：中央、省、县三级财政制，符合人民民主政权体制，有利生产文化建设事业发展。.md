　　The Ministry of Finance in Huafu Invites Experts and Celebrities
  　To Discuss the National Financial System
  　Unanimously Agreed That a Central, Provincial, and County Three-Tier Financial System is in Line with the People's Democratic Regime and Conducive to the Development of Production and Cultural Construction.
    [This Newspaper's Report] The North China Region Financial Conference is about to be held. In order to widely solicit opinions from all parties on the financial system and to facilitate the formulation of a financial system plan for next year, the Finance Department of the North China People's Government recently sent a preliminary draft of the financial system plan for next year to relevant parties and democratic figures, and held a symposium on August 31 to study and discuss it. Attendees included over 20 individuals, including Mr. Huang Yanpei, Zhang Naiqi, Qian Changzhao, Shen Zhiyuan, Qian Jiaju, Ai Zhicheng, Li Shizhang, Fan Hong, and Wu Dange. Comrade An Zhicheng from the Huafu Legislative Committee and responsible comrades from the North China Taxation Bureau and the Beiping Municipal Finance Bureau also attended the meeting. At the beginning of the meeting, Rong Zihe, Minister of the Finance Department, explained that we need to establish a financial system that is compatible with the people's democratic regime to ensure the smooth completion of various construction tasks. He requested the attending gentlemen to provide more opinions on the preliminary draft of the financial system plan prepared by the Finance Department. The attendees spoke enthusiastically, and everyone unanimously agreed with the central, provincial, and county three-tier financial system proposed in the plan, believing that it not only conforms to the people's democratic regime and is conducive to future production, cultural, and other construction work, but also suits China's national conditions. Mr. Huang Yanpei, after expressing his support for the three-tier system, said, "Having divided the three levels of finance, we must also make the powers of each level fair, so as to achieve mutual adjustment and non-infringement. The Kuomintang was unable to do this and never did. For example, Chen Guofu, as the pseudo-chairman of Jiangsu Province for six years, weakened the finances of various counties, so that when the Japanese soldiers attacked Jiangsu, the counties could not even afford to provide disaster relief. Because all county funds and local funds had no right to be spent, larger construction funds went to the Farmers Bank; however, later the pseudo-central government expanded the power of the party and weakened the finances of the provinces; it can be said that there was no system at all. The disorder of the Kuomintang's financial system was also manifested in the fact that higher-level governments arbitrarily purchased goods from lower-level governments, regardless of whether the lower levels needed them or not, and whether they could be used or not; when the lower-level finances were difficult, it resulted in arbitrary levies on the people, increasing the people's heavy and miscellaneous burdens. This will not happen under our three-tier financial system." When analyzing the essential differences between our national finance and the finance of the Kuomintang reactionary government, Mr. Zhang Naiqi said, "Under the rule of the Kuomintang, a county magistrate often had to be 'audited' for spending a few hundred dollars, but no one cared about how many people died or how much national resources were damaged." Mr. Ai Zhicheng said, "Under the Kuomintang regime, everything relied on guns. As long as there were guns, taxes could be levied arbitrarily on the people. There was no system, and the result was that the officials were fat and the people were thin; while under the people's regime, every bit of the country's income is used for public benefit. There is no corruption or waste here, and everything is for the people and beneficial to the people." When discussing the scope and relationship of financial divisions at all levels in the three-tier financial system, Mr. Qian Jiaju believed that from the perspective of the uneven economic development in various parts of China, it is similar to the early stage of construction in the Soviet Union. Therefore, the relationship between central finance and local finance can, to some extent, emulate the relationship between the Soviet federation and the states, learn more from the Soviet Union, and absorb their experience. Everyone also expressed many opinions on the principles of financial management. Mr. Huang Yanpei proposed the principle of "broad fundraising and tight spending" to facilitate the control and adjustment of surpluses and deficits in finance and ensure the implementation of financial revenue and expenditure plans. Mr. Wang Liewang believed that we must grasp Chairman Mao's instructions on the financial policy of "developing the economy and ensuring supply." Managing finance should take into account both "determining expenditure based on income" and "determining income based on expenditure" and unify the two. At the meeting, differing views were expressed on the issue of whether agricultural taxes should be assigned to the central government or to local governments. Comrade An Zhicheng finally expressed his opinion, saying that agricultural tax revenue in the past and in the future, before the completion of large-scale industrialization, is still the most important item in our central government's revenue. This main source of income should be controlled by the central government to lead and help local governments carry out production and construction. At the meeting, various different opinions were also expressed on issues such as the appropriate methods for dividing various taxes between the central and local governments, whether to adopt a commission system or a surcharge system; and it was proposed that expenses for developing cultural and educational undertakings, investigating national resources, and other expenses should be appropriately increased or new expenditure items should be added. Due to time constraints, those who did not have the opportunity to speak in detail at the symposium plan to submit their opinions in writing. The Finance Department is currently organizing and studying the above-mentioned opinions and will submit them to the upcoming Second North China Financial Conference for discussion.

　　华府财政部邀集专家名流
  　研讨国家财政体制
  　一致认为：中央、省、县三级财政制，符合人民民主政权体制，有利生产文化建设事业发展。
    【本报讯】华北区财政会议行将召开，华北人民政府财政部为广泛征集各方面对财政体制意见，俾便制定明年财政体制方案，日前曾将该部所拟明年财政体制方案初稿送各有关方面与社会民主人士，并于八月三十一日举行座谈会研究讨论。到会者计有黄炎培、章乃器、钱昌照、沈志远、千家驹、艾志诚、李世璋、樊弘、伍丹戈先生等二十余位。华府法制委员会安志成同志及华北税务总局、北平市财政局等负责同志亦与会参加。会议首由财政部戎子和部长说明我们需要确定一个与人民民主政体相适应的财政体制，以保证各种建设工作的顺利完成，请到会诸先生对财政部所拟财政体制方案初稿多多发表意见。到会人士热烈发言，大家一致同意方案中所拟定的中央、省、县三级财政体制，认为它不仅符合人民民主政权体制，有利于今后的生产文化等建设工作，而且也适合中国国情。黄炎培先生于表示赞同三级体制后，并说：“划分了三级财政，我们还要使各级职权公平，做到互相调剂与各不侵犯，过去国民党是做不到也从来没有做到的。例如：陈果夫做了六年的伪江苏省主席，就削弱了各县财政，使得日本兵打到江苏时，各县连救济难民的经费都无法开支。因为一切县经费地方款都无权开支，较大数量的建设费都归农民银行去了；但是，后来伪中央政府又扩张党的势力，削弱了各省财政；可以说根本没有什么制度可言。国民党财政制度的紊乱，还表现在上级政府向下级政府随意摊购物品，而不管下级需用不需用，能用不能用；当下级财政困难时，就形成随意向人民摊派，增加人民苛杂负担。这在我们的三级财政体制之下，是不会发生的。”当分析到我们的国家财政与国民党反动政府财政在本质上的不同时，章乃器先生说：“国民党统治下，一个县长用几百块钱往往倒要‘审计’一下，但老百姓死了多少，国家资源损坏了多少，却无人过问。”艾志诚先生说：“在国民党政权之下，一切依靠枪杆子，只要有枪杆子就可以随意向人民抽税，没有什么制度，其结果就是民瘦官肥；而在人民政权之下，则是国家任何收入点滴归公，这里没有贪污浪费，一切都是为人民、有利于人民的。”讨论到三级财政体制中各级财政划分的范围与关系时，千家驹先生认为从中国各地经济发展的不平衡这一点来说，是与苏联的初期建设阶段相似，因此中央财政与地方财政的关系，在某种程度上，可以仿效苏联的联邦与各邦的关系，多向苏联学习，吸收他们的经验。对于理财原则，大家也发表了许多意见，黄炎培先生提出“宽筹紧用”的原则，以使财政上便利掌握调剂盈亏，保证财政收支计划的执行。王烈望先生认为我们必须掌握毛主席指示“发展经济，保障供给”的财政方针，管理财政应将“量出为入”与“量入为出”互相照顾，使二者统一起来。会上对农业税划归中央还是划归地方适当的问题，发生了分歧的见解，安志成同志最后发表意见，他说，农业税收入在过去以及在将来大规模工业化完成以前，还是我们中央财政收入最主要的一项，这一主要的收入，应由中央掌握，统盘领导帮助地方进行生产建设。会上对于各种税收中央与地方划分办法，采取提成还是采取附加办法适当等问题亦发表了各种不同意见；并对于今后开展文教事业，调查国家资源等费用，提出了应适当增加开支或增设开支项目。座谈会因时间关系，不及详细发言者，均拟另以书面提出。以上各种意见，现财部正进行整理研究，提交即将召开的二届华北财政会议讨论。
