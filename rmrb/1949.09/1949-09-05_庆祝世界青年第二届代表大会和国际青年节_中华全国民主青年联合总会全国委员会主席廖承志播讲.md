　　The Second World Democratic Youth Congress opens today in Budapest, the capital of Hungary. On behalf of the All-China Democratic Youth Federation and the democratic youth of China, I extend internationalist revolutionary greetings to the congress and congratulate it on its success!

　　Since August, international youth and students have held various gatherings and activities in Budapest. Today marks the opening of the Second World Youth Congress. September 4th is also the 35th International Youth Day, and in mid-September, the International Union of Students will hold its 1949 annual council meeting. The democratic youth of China have sent their own delegations to participate in these various gatherings and other activities that have already taken place, are taking place, and are about to take place, and they have been warmly welcomed by the youth of various countries.

　　It is only natural that the representatives of Chinese youth are warmly welcomed by the youth of various countries. This is because the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the people's leader Chairman Mao, have basically eliminated the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang and will soon achieve complete victory throughout the country. As a result of this great victory of the Chinese People's Liberation War, all the conditions for establishing the People's Republic of China are ripe. The Political Consultative Conference will be convened soon, and a national central democratic coalition government will be established. After the establishment of this national central government, it will lead the people of the whole country to eliminate the remaining forces of the Kuomintang reactionaries at the fastest speed, unify the whole of China, and systematically and step by step carry out political, economic, cultural, and national defense construction work throughout the country. What does this fact represent? What is the significance of this fact? The significance of this fact is that the great Chinese people and Chinese youth will use the strength of the national revolutionary victory to further support the world democratic camp led by the Soviet Union, strike at the imperialists headed by the American reactionaries, weaken the strength of imperialism, and increase the strength of the people's democracy and lasting peace in the world. Moreover, our 475 million Chinese people and Chinese youth are organized, have revolutionary consciousness, have revolutionary armed forces, and have experience in defeating Chiang Kai-shek's large-scale military offensives. Such a China and such a Chinese people and Chinese youth have become a part of the world democratic camp led by the Soviet Union, undoubtedly increasing the strength of the world's people's democracy and lasting peace. This is the reason why Chinese youth representatives are warmly welcomed by the youth of various countries.

　　First of all, we must understand that the victory of the Chinese revolution is inseparable from the progress and development of the international anti-imperialist democratic movement. The main reason why the Chinese people have been able to win the victory of the revolution, in terms of international factors, is the result of the development and growth of the Soviet Union and the new democratic countries, the revolutionary struggles of the working people in capitalist countries, and the coordination of the anti-imperialist struggles of the vast people in colonial and semi-colonial countries. The victory of the great Chinese people's revolution helped the world anti-imperialist democratic camp; at the same time, the struggles of various countries and nations in the world against imperialism and for people's democracy directly weakened imperialism and helped the Chinese revolution. Starting from the strengthening of such internationalist understanding, we can draw the correct conclusion:

　　That the most powerful way for us Chinese people to help the anti-imperialist democratic movement of the youth of all countries in the world is to carry out the revolution to the end in our own country.

　　Chinese youth should complete the following goals to celebrate and support the Second Congress of the World Democratic Youth.

　　First, domestically, our task is to stand with the people of the whole country, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, to eliminate the rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism from Chinese territory, and to eliminate the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang (which is the concentrated expression of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism), in order to fully complete the liberation of the Chinese people. And stand with the people of the whole country, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, and actively engage in political, economic, cultural, and national defense construction work. In order to accomplish these two major tasks, we Chinese youth should support Chairman Mao's proposition to establish a people's democratic dictatorship in China and strive to realize the people's democratic dictatorship in China.

　　Second, in terms of international affairs: Our task is to support the anti-imperialist democratic camp headed by the Soviet Union and oppose the imperialist anti-democratic camp controlled by American and British imperialism. For the past four years, we have often heard people in the world youth movement opposing "leaning to one side." We Chinese youth, in accordance with Mao Zedong's instructions, are determined to lean to one side. Mao Zedong taught us: "The Chinese people either lean to the side of imperialism or lean to the side of socialism, without exception. It is impossible to sit on the fence, and there is no third way. We oppose the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique that leans to the side of imperialism, and we also oppose the illusion of a third way. Not only in China, but also in the whole world, either lean to the side of imperialism or lean to the side of socialism, without exception. Neutrality is disguised, and there is no third way."

　　Currently, the forces defending peace and the forces instigating reactionary wars are fighting. On the one hand, we believe that the existence of monopoly capitalism is the root of aggressive wars. On the other hand, we are not fatalists who believe that a new world war is inevitable. Due to the constant instigation of the imperialist bloc, they are not only instigating, but have also organized their running dogs to attack the Chinese people, and are promoting their running dogs to launch reactionary wars against the people of Indonesia, the people of Vietnam, the people of Burma, the people of Malaya, and the people of the Philippines. They are organizing a network of military bases against the Soviet Union, attempting to blockade the reactionary network of new democratic New China; the most die-hard reactionaries among them may even take risks, and the crisis of a new world war exists. However, we believe that once the forces of peace in the world unite and strengthen, they will surely be able to smash the conspiracies of the imperialist bloc to instigate war, and they will surely be able to prevent the crisis of a new world war. The strength of the world anti-imperialist democratic camp, which is increasing day by day, will continue to develop. The victory of the Soviet Union's firm peace policy is one example; the strong development of new democratic countries is one example; and the fact that the great Chinese people's revolution defeated the offensive of the Kuomintang reactionaries organized and supported by U.S. imperialism with armed struggle is another example. This is the direction of our efforts.

　　What should be particularly pointed out is that the independence and freedom movements of all colonial, semi-colonial, dependent countries, and oppressed nations around the world, and the victory of the Chinese People's Liberation War, are a great encouragement to all oppressed nations around the world. All anti-imperialist forces in all colonial, semi-colonial, and dependent countries, especially all anti-imperialist forces in Eastern countries, should unite to oppose the oppression of imperialism and reactionaries in various countries, and fight for independence and freedom. The Chinese youth, who have been constantly subjected to imperialist aggression and oppression for a hundred years, are willing to join hands with the youth of all colonial, semi-colonial, and dependent countries and oppressed nations, raise the banner of defeating imperialism, and advance bravely.

　　Do we have difficulties? There are difficulties. From the outside, U.S. imperialism is using its running dogs Chiang Kai-shek, Quirino, and Syngman Rhee to try to create a Pacific anti-communist alliance to blockade New China, and MacArthur is building Japan into a military base for anti-Soviet aggression against China. From the inside, the legacy that the old society handed over to us is so poor and backward. In the proportion of our national economy, industry accounts for only about 10%, while agriculture accounts for about 90%, and it has suffered from the destruction of eight years of the Japanese fascist war of aggression and three years of the Kuomintang bandit gang's counter-revolutionary civil war. Our difficulties today can be said to be significant. However, it must also be pointed out that the difficulties that the Chinese people have suffered for a hundred years are even greater than today. In the past, we Chinese people and youth were not frightened by even greater difficulties. On the contrary, we overcame the difficulties. It can be seen from this that in the future, we will be able to overcome the difficulties on the road ahead with certainty. After the October Revolution, the Soviet people and youth experienced the same difficulties as we do today. Their difficulties were deeper than ours, and the imperialists also waited for their failure. However, the Soviet people and youth, under the leadership of Lenin and Stalin, overcame the difficulties and achieved victory. They have established a great and glorious socialist country. The Soviet Union is our teacher. We Chinese youth believe that learning from the Soviet Union under the leadership of Mao Zedong is our guarantee of victory.

　　The convening of the Second World Youth Congress shows that the international solidarity of democratic youth around the world is more consolidated; it shows that the world democratic front headed by the Soviet Union is stronger; it shows that the war-mongers of the United States and Britain and their gang's conspiracies to instigate a new war have been unanimously condemned and resolutely opposed by the progressive youth of the world. In the great struggle for world lasting peace, people's democracy, national independence, and a better future for youth, we Chinese youth must firmly stand under the glorious banner of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, fight side by side with the youth of all countries, and advance hand in hand. We Chinese youth will definitely fully support and implement the policies formulated and decisions adopted by the Second World Democratic Youth Congress. We firmly believe that under the joint and resolute struggle of all progressive mankind in the world, those imperialists who are instigating and launching war adventures, especially the U.S. imperialists who vainly attempt to enslave the people of the whole world, will surely suffer a more shameful and thorough failure than their running dog Chiang Kai-shek.

　　Long live the success of the Second World Democratic Youth Congress!
　　Long live the 35th International Youth Day!
　　Long live the complete victory of world peace and democracy!
　　Long live the great international unity of youth fighting for a more fulfilling life for youth!

　　庆祝世界青年第二届代表大会和国际青年节
  　——中华全国民主青年联合总会全国委员会主席廖承志播讲
    世界民主青年第二届代表大会今天在匈牙利的京城布达佩斯开幕，我代表中华全国民主青年联合总会，代表中国的民主青年，向大会致国际主义的革命敬礼，并且庆祝大会成功！
    从八月以来，国际青年和学生在布达佩斯已经举行了各种集会和各种活动，今天起，又召开世界青年第二次代表大会，九月四号，又是第三十五届国际青年节，九月中旬，还要召开国际学联一九四九年度的理事会。中国的民主青年，已经派出了自己的代表团参加这些已经举行、正在举行和就要举行的各种集会和其他活动，并且受到各国青年的热烈欢迎。
    中国青年的代表，受到各国青年的热烈欢迎，这是很自然的。因为中国人民在中国共产党和人民领袖毛主席的领导之下已经在基本上消灭了国民党反动统治底力量，并且不需要很久的时间，就可以在全国范围内取得完全胜利。由于中国人民解放战争这个伟大胜利的结果，建立中华人民民主共和国的一切条件，都已经成熟。政治协商会议很快就要召开，全国的中央民主联合政府就要成立，这个全国的中央政府成立以后，将要领导全国人民，用最快的速度肃清国民党反动派的残余力量，统一全中国，并且有系统地、有步骤地在全国范围内进行政治的、经济的、文化的和国防的建设工作。这个事实表示了什么呢？这个事实有什么意义呢？这个事实的意义，就是说，伟大的中国人民和中国的青年，就要以全国革命胜利的力量，进一步地支持以苏联为领导的世界民主阵营，打击以美国反动派为首的帝国主义，削弱帝国主义的力量，增加世界人民民主和持久和平的力量。而我们这四万万七千万的中国人民和中国青年，又是有组织、有革命的觉悟、有革命的武力、并且有打败蒋介石的大规模军事进攻的经验的。这样的中国和这样的中国人民和中国青年成为了以苏联为首的世界民主阵营的一分子，无疑地增加了世界人民民主和持久和平的力量。这就是中国青年代表受到各国青年的热烈欢迎的原因。
    首先，我们必须了解中国革命的胜利，是和国际反帝民主运动的前进和发展，是分不开的。我们中国人民能够赢得革命的胜利，在国际上的因素来说，主要是由于苏联和新民主主义国家的发展壮大，资本主义国家劳动人民的革命斗争，殖民地半殖民地广大人民的反帝斗争的配合的结果。我们中国人民大革命的胜利，帮助了世界反帝民主阵营；同时世界上各国各民族的反帝国主义和为人民民主的斗争，又是直接地削弱帝国主义，而帮助了中国的革命。由这样的国际主义的认识的加强出发，我们就可以得出正确的结论：
    那我们中国人民要帮助世界各国青年的反帝民主运动，其最有力量的办法，莫过于在自己的国内彻底将革命进行到底的斗争。
    中国青年就应该完成以下这些目标，来庆祝和拥护世界民主青年的二次代表大会。
    第一，在国内方面，我们底任务就是和全国人民站在一起，在中国共产党的领导之下，从中国境内肃清帝国主义，封建主义和官僚资本主义的统治，肃清国民党的反动统治（这是帝国主义，封建主义，官僚资本主义三者的集中表现），以便全部完成中国人民的解放。并且和全国人民站在一起，在中国共产党的领导之下，积极于从事政治的，经济的，文化的，国防的建设工作。为了完成这两大任务，我们中国青年应当拥护毛主席的主张，在中国建立人民民主专政，并为实现中国人民民主专政而斗争。
    第二，就国际方面来说：我们底任务就是拥护以苏联为首的反帝国主义的民主营垒，反对由美、英帝国主义控制的帝国主义反民主营垒。四年来，我们时常在世界青年运动中，听见说过有人反对一边倒。我们中国青年，遵照毛泽东的指示，正要一边倒。毛泽东教导我们：“中国人不是倒向帝国主义一边，就是倒向社会主义一边，绝无例外，骑墙是不行的，第三条道路是没有的。我们反对倒向帝国主义一边的蒋介石反动派，我们也反对第三条道路的幻想。不但中国，全世界也一样，不是倒向帝国主义，就是倒向社会主义，绝无例外，中立是伪装的，第三条道路是没有的。”
    目前世界上保卫和平的力量与挑拨反动战争的力量正在搏斗。一方面我们认为独占资本主义存在就是侵略战争的根源。另一方面，我们也不是新世界战争命定不可避免的宿命论者。由于帝国主义集团不断挑拨，他们不但挑拨，并且曾经组织了他们的走狗进攻中国人民，正在推动它的走狗们，进攻印尼人民，进攻越南人民，进攻缅甸人民，进攻马来亚人民，进攻菲律宾人民的反动战争，他们正在组织反对苏联的军事基地网，企图封锁新民主主义新中国的反动网；他们当中最死硬的反动派，甚至有可能冒险，新世界战争危机是存在的。然而，我们认为一旦全世界拥护和平的力量，团结起来，加强起来，就一定可以粉碎帝国主义集团挑拨战争的阴谋，就一定可以阻止新的世界战争的危机。将一天天增加着的世界反帝民主阵营的力量，向前发展。苏联坚定的和平政策的胜利是一个例子；新民主主义国家的强大发展是一个例子；中国人民大革命用武装斗争战胜了美帝国主义组织支持的国民党反动派的进攻又是一个例子。这是我们努力的方向。
    应当特别提出的，就是全世界殖民地，半殖民地，附属国，被压迫民族的独立自由运动，中国人民解放战争的胜利对于全世界被压迫民族是一个很大的鼓励。全世界殖民地，半殖民地，依赖国一切反帝国主义的力量，首先是东方各国一切反帝国主义的力量，都应当团结起来，反对帝国主义和各国反动派的压迫，为独立自由而斗争。一百年来，不断遭受帝国主义侵略和压迫的中国青年愿意和全世界殖民地半殖民地依赖国被压迫民族底青年手携手，肩比肩，高举打倒帝国主义的旗帜，英勇前进。
    我们有没有困难呢？困难是有的，从外部来看，美帝国主义正在利用它的走狗蒋介石季里诺李承晚企图造成太平洋反共同盟，对新中国进行封锁，麦克阿瑟正在把日本建设为反苏侵略中国的军事基地。从内部看来，旧社会交给我们的遗产是这样贫乏和落后，在我们国民经济底比重中，工业只占百分之十左右，农业则占百分之九十左右，而且遭受八年日本法西斯侵略战争和三年蒋介石匪帮反革命内战的破坏，我们今天的困难可以说是重大的。然而又必须指明：一百年来，中国人民所遭受的困难比今天更为重大。从前我们中国人民和青年没有被更为重大的困难所吓倒，相反，我们克服了困难。由此可见，今后我们能够克服在前进途中的困难，是一定有把握的。十月革命后，苏联人民和青年曾经遭过和我们今天同样的困难，他们的困难比我们的困难更深，帝国主义者也曾等待过他们的失败，然而苏联人民和青年在列宁斯大林的领导之下，克服了困难，获得了胜利。他们已经建立起一个伟大的，光辉灿烂的社会主义国家，苏联就是我们的先生。我们中国青年，认为在毛泽东的领导下，学习苏联，就是我们胜利的保证。
    世界青年第二届代表大会的召开，表示全世界民主青年的国际团结是更加巩固了；表示以苏联为首的世界民主阵线更加强大了，表示美国和英国的战争贩子以及他们那一伙挑拨新战争的阴谋，受到了全世界进步青年的一致的斥责和坚决反对。我们中国青年，在争取世界持久和平、人民民主、民族独立以及青年更好的将来的伟大斗争中，要坚定地站在世界民主青年联盟的光辉的旗帜底下，和各国青年并肩作战，携手前进。我们中国青年，一定全力支持和执行世界民主青年第二次代表大会所制订的方针和通过的决定。我们坚决相信，在全世界进步人类共同一致的坚决斗争之下，那些正在挑拨和发动战争冒险的帝国主义者，尤其是妄想奴役全世界人民的美帝国主义者，一定会受到比他的走狗蒋介石还要可耻的彻底失败。
    世界民主青年第二次代表大会成功万岁！
    第三十五届国际青年节万岁！
    世界和平民主的彻底胜利万岁！
    为青年更美满的生活而斗争的国际青年大团结万岁！
