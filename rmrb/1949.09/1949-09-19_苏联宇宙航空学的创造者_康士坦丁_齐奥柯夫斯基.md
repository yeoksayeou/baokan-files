　　The Creator of Soviet Cosmonautics
  　Konstantin Tsiolkovsky
    K·Tsiolkovsky
    Fourteen years ago today (the 18th), a giant star of Soviet science fell. He was Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, the creator of an important link in aeronautics—cosmonautics.
    Today, as Wall Street's warmongers are frantically preparing for war, it is by no means meaningless to use the "People's Forum" to give a brief introduction to this great people's scientist for those who are concerned about the national defense construction of the world's democratic camp.
    Tsiolkovsky was born on September 17, 1857; the ears of this forester's son became almost completely useless at the age of nine. However, this deaf teenager completed a work of paramount importance in the history of human science with two eyes and one hand.
    From the age of twenty, he began to work as a mathematics teacher and taught for forty years. While teaching, he persistently and unremittingly studied astronomy, biology, and chemistry on his own.
    Of course, his greatest interest was in aeronautics. His debut paper in this field—"The Theory and Practice of Balloons"—won the praise of several Russian scientists at the time—D·Mendeleev, N·Zhukovsky, and A·Stoletov.
    Later, Tsiolkovsky boldly designed a corrugated steel airship; at the end of the 19th century, he completed an experiment in which a metal machine several times heavier than air rose into the sky. In 1895, in the article "Airplane—Bird-like Flying Machine," he even more astonishingly depicted all the models of modern airplanes; he predicted that the main driving force of airplanes should be internal combustion engines, and the fuselage should be streamlined. More valuable is that he designed an automatic rotary brake to prevent the wings and rudders from thickening.
    In 1903, he also gave a theoretical speculation on jet propulsion engines, introduced the method of using jet propulsion devices to explore planets, and made correct and practical predictions on the engine, speed, and fuel types of this wonderful "flying machine" that is about to be used to conquer planets.
    However, such a hard-working, self-restrained, and wholeheartedly serving the future of human happiness scientist was a forgotten person under the reactionary Tsarist rule: he could not get a little bit of the material help he needed. He had to rely on his meager income from teaching to conduct various scientific experiments and design various models. In this way, he had to live an extremely simple life.
    Like many other Soviet scientists, the October Revolution brought him new hope and a new life. Under the Soviet regime, Tsiolkovsky realized his ideals: he received huge help from the state, so that his inventive genius was fully developed.
    Please read the letter he wrote to Stalin on the eve of his death!
    "The wise leader and friend of all working people—Comrade Stalin: I have always dreamed in my life that my work could at least bring a little progress to mankind. Before the revolution, this dream of mine was rarely likely to be realized. However, the great October Revolution recognized the work of my self-education. The Soviet regime and the party of Lenin and Stalin gave me effective help. I felt that the people loved me, and this love gave me the strength to continue my work after I was sick. However, in any case, the disease does not allow me to complete the work I have already started.
    "The books and papers I have written on aviation, rocket flight, and planetary travel, I leave them all to the true leaders of human cultural progress, the Bolshevik Party and the Soviet government. I firmly believe that they will bring a successful conclusion to my work...
    "My heart and all my thoughts yearn for you, and to you, I extend my last sincere salute!
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　K·Tsiolkovsky
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　September 18, 1935
    Indeed. The help that the Party of Lenin and Stalin and the Soviet government gave to this self-taught scientist was enormous. In addition to helping him publish a large number of papers, he was also given a giant airship model with a volume of 1,000 cubic meters, equipped with corrugated stainless steel. As pointed out above, these aids enabled Tsiolkovsky's genius to be fully developed. After the revolution, he made greater achievements in the research of rockets, jet propulsion engines, semi-jet stratospheric airplanes, and planetary airplanes. He predicted the possibility and importance of conquering the stratosphere and creating supersonic flight speeds; his research became the scientific basis for modern jet propulsion theory.
    He passed away at the age of seventy-eight. In order to commemorate this scientist who was loved by them, the Soviet people have established a museum in the house where he died in Kaluga. Various designs and models made by him personally, as well as a huge amount of manuscripts and works, are exquisitely displayed for the admiration of tens of thousands of well-fed and well-clothed Soviet people.
    On his tombstone, there are these lovely prophecies:
    "Mankind will not stay on Earth forever; in order to pursue light and space, mankind will first timidly enter the area outside the atmosphere, and finally conquer the entire solar system."

　　苏联宇宙航空学的创造者
  　康士坦丁·齐奥柯夫斯基
    Ｋ·齐奥柯夫斯基
    十四年前的今天（十八日），苏联科学界的一颗巨星陨落了。他是航空学中重要的一环——宇宙航空学——的创造者康士坦丁·齐奥柯夫斯基。
    当华尔街的战争贩子正在疯狂备战的今天，利用“人民园地”来对这位伟大的人民科学家作一个简单的介绍，对于关心世界民主阵营的国防建设的人想必不是一桩毫无意义的事。
    齐奥柯夫斯基生于一八五七年九月十七日；这位林务官的儿子的耳朵在九岁的时候便几乎完全不中用了。然而这个聋少年却用两只眼睛一只手完成了人类科学史上有头等重要意义的工作。
    他从二十岁起便开始当算学教员，一直教了四十年。就在教书的同时，他有始有终坚毅不懈地自修天文学，生物学以及化学。
    当然，他最大的兴趣还是在于航空学上面。他在这方面的处女论文——“气球的理论和实际”曾获得了当时几位俄国科学家——Ｄ·孟德里耶夫，Ｎ·崔可夫斯基以及Ａ·斯安莱托夫等——的称许。
    后来，齐奥柯夫斯基大胆地设计了一个波纹钢的小飞船；十九世纪末期，他完成了一个比空气要重若干倍的金属机器上升天空的试验。一八九五年，在“飞机——鸟状的飞行机器”一文中，他更惊人地将近代飞机的模型全部描绘了出来；他预言飞机的主要推进力应该是内燃机，机身当呈流线型。更可贵的是：他设计了一个防止机翼机舵变厚的自动回转制动器。
    一九○三年他又给喷火推进机一个理论上的推测，介绍了利用喷火推进装置去星球探险的方法，并且将这个行将利用之以征服星球的奇妙的“飞行机器”的引擎、速度、燃料种类等，都作了正确实用的预断。
    然而，这样刻苦自持，一心一意为人类幸福前途服务的大科学家，在反动的沙皇统治下却是一个被遗忘了的人：他得不到一点点他所需要的物质帮助。他做各种科学实验以及设计装置各种模型都得靠他教书得来的那点可怜的收入，这样，他便不得不过着极其简单的生活。
    正如很多其他的苏联科学家一样，十月革命给他带来了新的希望与新的生活。在苏维埃政权下，齐奥柯夫斯基实现了他的理想：他获得了国家巨大的帮助，从而他的发明天才得到了充分的发展。
    请你读读他在临终前夕给斯大林写的信吧！
    “全体劳动人民的贤明的领袖和朋友——斯大林同志：我一生总在梦想我的工作至少可以带给人类一点小小的进步。在革命以前，我这种梦想是很少有希望实现的。但是，伟大的十月革命承认了我这个自我教育者的工作。苏维埃政权以及列宁斯大林的党给了我有效的帮助。我感觉到人民群众在热爱我，这种热爱使我在闹病以后还有气力去继续我的工作。然而，无论如何，病魔不允许我完成我已经开始了的工作了。
    “我在航空，火箭飞行以及星球旅行等方面所写的书籍论文，我把它全部遗留给人类文化进步的真正领导者，布尔塞维克党和苏维埃政府。我坚信他们将带给我的工作一个成功的结论………
    “我的心及我所有的思想都向往你，对你，我谨致以最后的诚挚的敬礼！
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Ｋ·齐奥柯夫斯基
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　一九三五年九月十八日
    的确。列宁斯大林的党及苏维埃政府给这位自学成功的科学家的帮助是巨大的。除了帮助他出版大量的论文以外，并给他用波皱形不锈钢装置了一个体积达一千立方公尺的巨型飞船模型。正如上面所指出的，这些帮助使齐奥柯夫斯基的天才获得了充分的发展。他在革命以后，在火箭，喷火推进机，半喷火式同温层飞机，星球飞机等的研究上得到了更大的成就。他预断了征服同温层及创造超音波飞行速度的可能性和重要性；他的研究成为现代关于喷火推进理论的科学根据。
    他在七十八岁的时候辞世了。苏联的人民为了纪念这位为他们所热爱的科学家，已经在高古卡他死时的住房里建立了一个博物馆。他亲手制作的各种设计与模型以及巨量的手稿和著作都被精巧地陈列着，给成千成万的丰衣足食的苏联人民瞻仰。
    在他的墓碑上，有这样几句可爱的预言：
    “人类将不会永远呆在地球上；为了追求光体与空间，人类首先会胆震心惊地进入大气范围以外的地方，而终于征服整个的太阳系。”
