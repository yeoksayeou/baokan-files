　　Improvement of Fishery Production in China
　　Chen Lingxiu
　　I
　　China's nine coastal provinces, with a coastline extending from the mouth of the Yalu River in Andong in the north, through Liaoning, Hebei, Shandong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Fujian, to the mouth of the Beilun River in Fangcheng County, Guangdong; in addition, there are Taiwan Province and Hainan Island Special Administrative Region, with a coastline extending more than 14,000 li. The coastal fishing grounds cover an area of ​​285,481 square nautical miles. The coastal islands are dotted, the harbors are crisscrossed, and the seabed is mostly flat, such as the Bohai Sea, the Yellow Sea, and the nearshore of the East China Sea. Due to the shallow water, trawl fisheries and hand-cranked net fisheries are extremely easy to develop. Moreover, the convergence of warm and cold currents in the near sea, the suitable water temperature, and the injection of unlimited organic matter from various rivers of all sizes result in abundant plankton and abundant fish and shellfish production. The main fish species produced are: yellow croaker, yellow fish, hairtail, cuttlefish, sea bream, Chinese herring, Spanish mackerel, shark, sturgeon, 鰣 fish, flounder, pomfret, eel, 鲂鮃, cod, mackerel and dace, shrimp, crab, clam, ark shell, clam and seaweed, etc., no less than 3,000 kinds. The most famous inland river products are bream, white fish, carp, crucian carp, silver carp, 鱅 and grass carp. According to statistics, the average annual output before the war was about 2.2 million tons (freshwater fish accounted for a little over a quarter). There were 391 motorized fishing boats, with a total tonnage of 29,370 tons, and 99,628 old-fashioned fishing boats, with a total tonnage of 747,210 tons. There were 465,500 fishermen directly engaged in fishing production, and no less than 7 million people indirectly dependent on fisheries for their livelihoods. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the statistical fishery output in the 35th year of the Republic of China was only 1,065,875 tons (freshwater fish accounted for a little less than one-half), with 1,099 fishing boats and 97,145 fishing vessels, and 1,054,000 direct and indirect fishery producers. After the war, the Kuomintang bandit gang received many Japanese and puppet fishing boats and added 126 American-style fishing boats, but because of backward technology and improper utilization, the output was very small. At the same time, the number of fishery producers has also decreased significantly compared with the pre-war period.
　　II
　　China's fishery production was insufficient to meet domestic needs even before the war, and a large number of aquatic products were imported every year. According to the statistics of fish, shellfish and seafood imported from various seaports in the 22nd year of the Republic of China, the total number reached 2,508,881 customs gold units, of which salted fish was the largest, followed by dried shrimp, sea cucumber, and kelp, followed by abalone, agar, and green scale fish (canned fish and shellfish are not included). The extent of the leakage can be imagined.
　　During the Anti-Japanese War, the enemy puppets established many aquatic product business institutions in their occupied areas, plundered our country's fishery economic resources, and systematically destroyed China's fishery equipment. For example, the mother ship type large hook boats in Chongwu, Fujian, which were very developed, were burned by the enemy more than 700 ships in one instance after landing; its intention was to prevent us from fishing in the far sea, so that the market could be monopolized, and the fishery village economy was even more bankrupt. After the surrender of the Japanese invaders, the Kuomintang pseudo-Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry successively received the following in the South China region: Atlantic Fishery Co., Ltd., Hainan Island Aquatic Products Co., Ltd., Takunan Industrial Co., Ltd., and South China Japanese Fisheries Control Company. The companies received in the Beijing-Shanghai area include: Central China Aquatic Products Company, Toyo Trading Company, Central China Aquatic Products Refining Company, Imperial Aquatic Products Co., Ltd., Oriental Ice Making Co., Ltd., International Aquatic Products Co., Ltd., Hayashi-Kane Shoten, Inoue Shoten, Minamikawa Toshinan Shoten, Central China Fresh Fish Distribution Association, Honda Fish Store, and Fuji Trading Company. The units received in the North China region include: Qingdao Branch of the Central China Fisheries Association, Qingdao Aquatic Products Control Association, Shandong Fisheries Co., Ltd., Nakai Sake Brewery, Nishimura Yoko, Ishibashi Refrigeration Warehouse, Hayashi-Kane Shoten, Changcheng Yoko, North China Aquatic Products Control Company and Refrigeration Warehouse, etc. Due to the receipt of the above-mentioned institutions and existing fishery materials, the Kuomintang formed three large enterprise companies with bureaucratic capital, established Hainan Aquatic Products Company in Panyu, Guangdong (the main equipment includes more than 20 fishing boats, as well as ice-making and refrigeration plants, canning factories, etc.), and established the China Aquatic Products Company in Shanghai (seven pairs of hand-cranked net fishing boats, eight refrigeration and ice-making plants, one net-making factory, one fish liver oil manufacturing factory, one canning factory, and one fishing boat repair yard), and established the Yellow Sea Aquatic Products Company in Qingdao (six pairs of hand-cranked fishing boats, one refrigeration and ice-making plant, one kelp farm and one sea cucumber farm). In addition, the US Fishery Rehabilitation Relief Supplies were used to establish the Fishery Rehabilitation Supplies Management Office in Shanghai, nominally to relieve the rehabilitation of fisheries in coastal provinces, but in reality, it was still controlled by bureaucrats. Several corruption and chaos incidents occurred continuously, and the result was unbearable losses. Therefore, it was repeatedly criticized and opposed by national fishery organizations, and the fishery relief supplies were never distributed to coastal fishermen. Also, during the Liberation War in Shanghai, the Kuomintang army sank 26 fishing boats in the Huangpu River. Their crime of destroying fisheries cannot be increased!
　　In addition to the fishery enterprise institutions controlled by the above-mentioned bureaucratic capital, the Fishery Department was established in the pseudo-Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry in the 35th year of the Republic of China, and the fish markets in Shanghai, Qingdao, Guangzhou and other places were restored, and the Marine Fisheries Supervision Offices in Hebei-Shandong, Jiangsu-Zhejiang, Fujian-Taiwan, and Guanghai districts were established. At the beginning of the 36th year of the Republic of China, the "Central" Aquatic Products Experimental Institute was established. Although it was named to specialize in aquatic product experiment and research matters, it actually achieved nothing. As for the fishery administration of each province, it is all under the management of the Department of Construction. In addition, the Fishery Bank Group was restored to handle fishery loans and regulate fishery finance. A drop in the bucket, to no avail. At the same time, because of the Kuomintang's corruption, it was unable to effectively relieve the suffering of fishermen on the ground, so that fisheries not only failed to fully recover, but became manipulated by a few people, and the majority of fishermen were still oppressed. The destruction and withering of fisheries and the bankruptcy of the fishery village economy have brought China's fishery crisis closer and closer. Today, the whole country is about to be liberated, and how to revive fisheries and restore the fishery village economy is a serious issue facing the fishery industry.
　　III
　　Regarding the fishery situation in coastal provinces, the fishery output, fishermen and fishing boat statistics in the 35th year of the Republic of China can be used for reference:
　　Statistics of Fishermen, Fishing Boats and Fish Production in Coastal Provinces (Statistics of the Pseudo-Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry in the 35th Year of the Republic of China) Province　Marine Fish Production　　Freshwater Fish Production　　　Number of Fishermen　　　　Number of Fishing Boats　　　　Remarks Andong　181.7　　　——　　　　8,093 people　　1,950 boats

　　Appendix
　　In addition to the above-mentioned provinces, freshwater fish production also includes 25,269 shi dan in Jilin, 32,519 shi dan in Heilongjiang, 272 shi dan in Jehol, 762 shi dan in Suiyuan, 270 shi dan in Xinjiang, 6,271 shi dan in Gansu, 652 shi dan in Shaanxi, 238,920 shi dan in Henan, 250,453 shi dan in Hubei, 579,572 shi dan in Jiangxi, and 95,334 shi dan in Anhui, totaling 1,230,294 shi dan.
　　Note ① Although the statistics of freshwater fish production in the country are not complete, judging from the freshwater fish production in the above-mentioned coastal provinces and inland provinces, the total is 10,355,891 shi dan, which is equivalent to about 517,799 tons. If the total output is investigated and counted in detail, it should not be lower than the marine fish production.
　　②Hainan Island is not included in the marine fish production. According to the pre-war statistics, there were about 45,000 fishermen and 4,000 fishing boats, with an average annual output of about 32,300 tons. Although this number has changed after the war, it will not be too far apart. It is estimated that one-fourth of the fishing boats may be lost, one-fourth of the fishermen may be reduced, and one-third to one-fourth of the fish production may be reduced.
　　③The fishing boats are all old-fashioned wooden ones, and there are 1,099 new-style fishing boats in total (including 126 from the Fishery Management Office, 872 from Taiwan, 101 from Qingdao, and 120 from other places).
　　④The above statistics are all reported by the construction departments and fishery associations of various provinces to the pseudo-Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry at that time.
　　IV
　　In the past hundred years, China's production undertakings have been paralyzed by the multiple destructions of feudal forces, imperialism, and bureaucratic capital, and fisheries are no exception. First, it is bound by unequal treaties. Foreign fishing boats (especially Japan) recklessly entered China's territorial waters and arbitrarily fished and left fully loaded. According to statistics, before "August 15th", there were no less than 1,200 Japanese fishing boats fishing in the East China Sea. Second, the fishermen themselves are mostly exploited and oppressed by fish dealers and local governments, and often cannot maintain their livelihoods, so they cannot engage in fisheries. Third, fishing gear and fishing methods have not been improved with the evolution of the times, resulting in insufficient catches to meet market needs. Fourth, Kuomintang bureaucratic capital manipulated fishery relief supplies and fishery enterprises, destroying small and medium-sized fishery production. Fifth, the import surplus of marine products every year is very large, which not only leads to the outflow of money, but also affects the development of our fisheries. Due to the existence of the above five main reasons, China's fisheries, except for the liberated areas, showed a very declining situation. However, China's fishing villages are not beyond saving. Based on my humble opinion, I would like to put forward the following opinions:
　　(1) Under the new democratic economic principles, state-owned enterprises should play a leading role in development. Therefore, aquatic product enterprises companies (including fishing, manufacturing, aquaculture, refrigeration and ice making, etc.) should be established in coastal areas throughout the country. As far as I know, only Dalian Guandong Aquatic Products Company (with 10 pairs of fishing boats, 1 agar factory, 1 small-scale canning factory, and 1 kelp farm) and Sino-Soviet Aquatic Products Company (with 8 pairs of fishing boats, 1 large-scale canning factory, 1 ice-making refrigeration warehouse, and 1 shipyard) have been established. State-owned fishery enterprise companies should also be established in Tianjin, Qingdao, Shanghai, Dinghai, Fuzhou and other places.
　　(2) Refer to the fishery conditions in coastal provinces, establish experimental fishing villages, replenish fishing boats and fishing gear, and try out new-style fishing boats and fishing gear. And encourage the improvement and creation of fishing methods and fishing gear to promote fishery development.
　　(3) Issue fishery loans, organize fishery production and marketing cooperatives, help fishermen produce, organize transportation and sales, and avoid intermediate exploitation by fish dealers.
　　(4) Establish rationalized fish markets in major coastal cities, regulate the supply and demand of fish, and promote the sales of fish products.
　　(5) Advocate and encourage large-scale freshwater and saltwater aquaculture to develop production.
　　(6) Restrict the import of aquatic products to protect domestic fisheries.
　　(7) Establish aquatic science experimental stations and reorganize aquatic education institutions in various provinces to train a large number of aquatic technicians to serve fishermen.
　　(8) Plan to build fishery ports in coastal provinces to facilitate the return of fishing boats, and set up typhoon warning stations to ensure the safety of fishermen at sea.
　　According to the above-mentioned key points, under the new democratic economic principles, a detailed plan should be made first to promote fishery development, starting from a few areas and gradually extending to the whole country.
　　The area of ​​China's coastal fishing grounds is no less than 280,000 square nautical miles. If the annual output of fish and shellfish is 10 tons per square nautical mile, the total output can reach more than 2.8 million tons. Adding more than 500,000 tons of freshwater fish production (existing), the total is more than 3.3 million tons. Calculated at the current minimum price per ton, the total value is no less than 132 billion yuan. Such a huge production figure can not only increase national income, but also indirectly promote the development of related production undertakings. I hope to attract the attention of the government and the people of the whole country!

　　我国渔业生产的改进
    陈灵秀
  　一
    我国沿海九省，海岸线北起安东鸭绿江口，经辽宁、河北、山东、江苏、浙江、福建，达广东防城县之北仑江口；此外尚有台湾省及海南岛特别行政区，海岸线延长达一万四千余里。沿海渔场面积为二八五、四八一方海里。沿海岛屿星罗棋布，港湾纵横交错，海底多平坦，如渤海、黄海、东海近岸，因水浅关系，拖网渔业及手缲网渔业极易发展，且在近海寒暖流交会，水温适宜，复由各大小河川注入无限有机物质，因之浮游生物繁盛，鱼介产量甚丰。所产主要鱼类有：黄花鱼、黄鱼、带鱼、墨鱼、鲷鱼、鳓鱼、马鲛鱼、鲨鱼、鲟鱼、＠鱼、鲽鱼、鲳鱼、鳗鱼、鲂＠、鳕鱼、鲭鱼及鲮类、虾、蟹、蛏、蚶、蛤蜊及海藻等，不下三千余种。内河所产以鳊、白、鲤、鲫、鲢、＠及青鱼等为最著。统计战前常年产量约二百二十余万吨（淡水鱼约占四分之一强）。机器渔船三九一艘，总吨数为二九、三七○吨，旧式渔船九九、六二八只，总吨数为七四七、二一○吨。直接从事捕鱼生产之渔民为四六五、五○○名，连同间接以渔业为生者不下七百万人。而抗日战争胜利后，统计三十五年度之渔产量不过一、○六五、八七五吨（淡水鱼产约占二分之一弱），渔轮一、○九九艘，渔船九七、一四五只，直接间接从事渔业生产者一百零五万四千余人。战后国民党匪帮虽然接收了许多日伪渔轮，和增添一二六艘美式渔轮，但因为技术落后，利用不善，以致产量甚少。同时，渔业生产者亦较战前大减。
    二
    我国渔产在战前就不足供国内需要，每年皆有大量水产物输入。据民国二十二年由各海港进口鱼介海产统计，总数达二、五○八、八八一海关金单位，中以咸鱼为最巨，干虾、海参、海带次之，鲍鱼、洋粉、青鳞鱼等又次之（罐头鱼介不在内）。漏卮之大，可以想见。
    抗战期中，敌伪在其侵占区域，设立水产事业机构颇多，攫夺吾国之渔业经济资源，有计划破坏我国渔业设备，如福建崇武之母船式大钩船，向甚发达，敌人登陆后，一次即焚毁七百余艘；其用意在使我无法往远海捕渔，市场可听其垄断，渔村经济因之破产更甚。日寇投降后，国民党伪农林部先后在华南区接收者，有大西洋渔业株式会社、海南岛水产株式会社、拓南产业株式会社、华南日本渔业统制会社。京沪区接收者，计有华中水产公司、东洋贸易公司、中支水产炼制公司、帝国水产株式会社、东方制冰株式会社、国际水产株式会社、林兼商店、井上商店、南川利南商店、中支那鲜鱼配给组合、本田鱼店、富士商行。华北区接收者，计有华中水产协会青岛支部、青岛水产统制组合、山东渔业株式会社、中井造酒厂、西村洋行、石桥冷藏库、林兼商店、昌成洋行、华北水产统制会社及冷藏库等。由于接收了以上各机构，及原有渔业物资，国民党以官僚资本组成了三个大企业公司，在广东番禺成立了海南水产公司（主要设备有渔轮二十数艘，及制冰冷藏厂罐头工厂等），上海成立中华水产公司（手缲网渔轮七对、冷藏制冰厂八所、制网厂一所、鱼肝油制造厂一所、罐头工厂一处，及修造渔船场一所），青岛成立黄海水产公司（手缲渔轮六对、冷藏制冰厂一所、海带养殖场及海参养殖场各一处）。此外，并利用美国渔业善后救济物资在上海成立渔业善后物资管理处，名目为救济沿海各省渔业复员，而实际仍操诸官僚之手，若干贪污混乱事件，不断发生，乌烟瘴气一团糟，结果反赔累不堪，故屡遭全国渔业团体机构之批评与反对，而渔业救济物资始终未能分配于沿海渔民。又当解放上海战争中，国民党军曾击沉渔轮二十六艘于黄浦江中。其摧残渔业之罪孽无复以加！
    除上述官僚资本操纵之渔业企业机构外，于三十五年中伪农林部内设置渔业司，又恢复上海青岛广州等地之鱼市场，并成立冀鲁、江浙、闽台、广海等区海洋渔业督导处，民国三十六年初，又有“中央”水产实验所之设立，虽名为专司水产试验研究事宜，实际亦无何成绩。至于各省渔业行政，则均属建设厅掌理。此外又恢复渔业银行团、办理渔贷调剂渔业金融。杯水车薪，无济于事。同时，因国民党之贪污腐败，尤未能实地解除渔民苦痛，以致渔业不但未能全面复员，反而变成少数人操纵，多数渔民仍受压迫。渔业摧残凋蔽，渔村经济破产，使中国渔业危机日迫。今日全国即将解放，如何苏生渔业，复兴渔村经济，乃当前渔业界之严重问题。
    三
    关于沿海各省渔业状况，可以三十五年度渔产量、渔民及渔船统计表示，以供参考：

    附记
    淡水鱼产除上述之省份外，尚有吉林二五、二六九市担，黑龙江三二、五一九市担，热河二七二市担，绥远七六二市担，新疆二七○市担，甘肃六、二七一市担，陕西六五二市担，河南二三八、九二○市担，湖北二五○、四五三市担，江西五七九、五七二市担，安徽九五、三三四市担，共计一、二三○、二九四市担。
    注①全国淡水鱼产量统计虽不完全，但上述之沿海各省及内陆各省之淡水鱼产量而论，共一○、三五五、八九一市担，折合约五一七、七九九吨，其总产量若详加调查统计，当不在海水鱼产量之下。
    ②海水鱼产尚有海南岛未列入，据抗战前总计渔民约四五、○○○人，渔船四、○○○只，常年产量约三二、三○○吨，战后此数字虽有变化，但亦相差不会过远，渔船估计可能损失四分之一，渔民亦可能减少四分之一，鱼产量亦可能减少三分之一——四分之一。
    ③渔船均是旧式木造者，新式渔轮共一、○九九艘（计渔管处一二六艘、台湾八七二艘、青岛一○一艘、其他各地一二○艘）。
    ④以上统计均系当时各省建设厅及渔会团体等呈报伪农林部者。
    四
    近百年来，我国生产事业，在封建势力、帝国主义、官僚资本之重重摧残，已呈瘫痪不遂状态，渔业亦不例外。第一，它受着不平等条约之束缚，外国渔轮（尤以日本为甚）肆无忌惮开入我国领海，任意侵渔，饱载而去。据统计“八一五”以前日本渔船在中国东海捕渔者不下千二百艘之多。第二，渔民本身，多受鱼行及地方政府之剥削与压迫，常不能维持生活，以致无法进行渔业。第三，渔具渔法未能随时代之进化而改良，致捕捞数量不敷市场需要。第四，国民党官僚资本操纵渔业救济物资及渔业企业，摧残中小渔业生产。第五，每年海产物入超甚巨，不但金钱外溢，且影响我渔业发展。因有以上五条主因之存在，我国渔业除解放区外，表现了极为衰落之惨况。但我国渔村亦非莫可挽救者，兹就管见所及，略提如下意见：
    （１）在新民主主义经济原则下，国营企业应有带头发展作用。因此，全国沿海应分区成立水产企业公司（包括渔捞、制造、养殖及冷藏制冰等事业）。现已成立者，据我所知只有大连关东水产公司（有渔轮十对、洋粉厂一所、小规模罐头工场一所、海带养殖场一所）及中苏水产公司（有渔轮八对、大规模罐头制造场一所、制冰冷藏库一所及修船场一所）。其他如天津、青岛、上海、定海、福州等地，亦应设立国营渔业企业公司。
    （２）参照沿海各省渔业情况，分设实验渔村，补充渔船渔具，试用新式渔船渔具。并奖励渔法渔具之改良与创造，以谋渔业发展。
    （３）发放渔贷，组织渔业产销合作社，扶助渔民生产，组织运销，避免鱼行中间剥削。
    （４）于沿海各大都市设立合理化之鱼市场，调剂鱼货供求，推广鱼产销路。
    （５）提倡奖励大规模淡水咸水之养殖事业，以发展生产。
    （６）限制水产物之入口，保护本国渔业。
    （７）设立水产科学试验场，并整理各省水产教育机构，造就大批为渔民服务之水产技术人员。
    （８）筹划建设沿海各省渔业港，便利渔船往返，并筹设暴风警报台，以策海上渔民之安全。
    根据上述诸要项，在新民主主义经济原则下，应先做出详细的计划以推动渔业发展，先从少数地区开始，逐渐推及全国。
    我国沿海渔场面积不下二十八万平方海里，如以每平方海里年产鱼介十吨计，则总生产额可达二百八十余万吨，再加淡水鱼产（现有）五十余万吨，共计三百三十余万吨。每吨以现在最低价计，总值不下一万三千二百余亿。如此庞大生产数字，不但可增加国民收入，且可间接促进有关生产事业之发展。希望能引起政府和全国人民的注意！
