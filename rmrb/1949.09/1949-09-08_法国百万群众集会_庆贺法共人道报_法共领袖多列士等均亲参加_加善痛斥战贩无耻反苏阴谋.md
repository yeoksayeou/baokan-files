Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 7th: TASS, Paris: On the 4th, over a million French people participated in the traditional annual celebration of "l'Humanité" in the Bois de Vincennes. This assembly became a powerful demonstration of the united strength of the French working people in their struggle for peace. As dusk approached, Casan, the editor-in-chief of "l'Humanité," addressed the vast audience from the podium. Standing on the podium were Thorez, Duclos, Mouvet, Fajon, Casanova, Bonte, Villon, Maumousseau, Michaud, and others. In his speech, Casan emphasized that "l'Humanité" is the only newspaper in France that belongs to the people, and is the only free, absolutely independent, honest, and unblemished newspaper. Casan spoke of the development and gathering of peace forces worldwide, saying, "We are convinced of the invincibility of the people's power, which is rising everywhere against the forces of evil." Casan then described in detail the French people's struggle for peace. He said: The French people are constantly demanding an end to the criminal war against the Vietnamese people. Currently, we are facing a new and shameful situation. Four years after Hitler was defeated, some people dare to demand that the French people join in a war against the Soviet Union, which saved the world with its incalculable sacrifices. The vast majority of the French people oppose this heinous aggression. The Soviet Union has proposed, and continues to propose to the world, conditions for lasting and just peace. It proposes to limit armaments and prohibit the use of atomic bombs. But the answer it receives is malicious provocation and war preparations. Our reply, from those of us gathered in this Bois de Vincennes, to all the war-mongers is very clear: the French people will never participate in a war against the Soviet Union. Casan's words evoked prolonged and stormy cheers.

　　法国百万群众集会
  　庆贺法共人道报
    法共领袖多列士等均亲参加
  　加善痛斥战贩无耻反苏阴谋
    【新华社北平七日电】塔斯社巴黎讯：四日，一百万以上的法国人参加在温桑森林举行的人道报每年传统的庆祝会，这个大会成了法国劳动人民在争取和平的斗争中团结一致的有力示威。黄昏临近时，人道报总编辑加善在讲台上向广大的听众演讲。站在讲台上的，有多列士、杜克洛、摩维、法戎、加桑诺伐、邦特、佛拉商、摩茅色、米萧及其他人等。加善在他的演讲中着重指出，人道报是法国唯一属于人民的报纸，并且是唯一自由、绝对独立、诚实及不被沾污的报纸。加善谈到全世界和平力量的发展和聚合，他说：“我们确信人民力量的不可征服，这种力量正在每一个地方兴起，反对恶势力。”然后，加善详细叙述法国人民争取和平的斗争。他说：法国人民不断地要求停止对越南人民的罪恶战争。目前，我们正面临新的可耻的形势，在希特勒被打败四年之后，竟仍有人敢于要求法国人民联合参加反对曾以其无法计算的牺牲而拯救了世界的苏联的战争。极大多数的法国人民反对这个罪恶滔天的侵略。苏联曾建议，而且现在仍继续向全世界建议持久与公正和平的条件。它建议限制军备，并禁止使用原子弹。但它所得到的回答是：恶意的挑拨和战争准备。我们在这个温桑森林集会的人们，对一切战争贩子的答复是非常明白的。法国人民决不参加对苏联的战争。加善的这些话引起了长久的风暴般的欢呼声。
