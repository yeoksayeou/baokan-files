Xinhua News Agency, Central China Front, 7th: A frontline reporter reports on the People's Liberation Army's advance into southern Jiangxi, stating that in half a month, they annihilated over 5,000 enemy troops and liberated 14 county towns. The report states: In mid-August, the People's Liberation Army advanced towards southern Jiangxi along both banks of the Gan River. Thanks to the PLA's heroic fighting spirit and arduous efforts in overcoming difficulties, and thanks to the enthusiastic support of the broad masses in the old liberated areas that had been separated for 15 years, the PLA swept through southern Jiangxi in a short period of 15 days, liberating Ganzhou, a military stronghold in southern Jiangxi, and opening a path for the future direct assault on Guangzhou, the lair of the Kuomintang remnant bandits.

The PLA, advancing along the Taihe-Yinkeng highway on the east side of the Gan River, liberated Xingguo, a model county in the old liberated area during the Land Revolution War. Local residents, without exception, were overjoyed, spreading the news of the PLA's arrival: "Our loved ones have returned!" The masses of residents voluntarily brought grain from far away, braving the scorching heat to supply the PLA. When the PLA advanced to pursue and wipe out fleeing enemies, the peasants voluntarily led the way and scouted for the troops. On one occasion, an enemy wooden boat fell behind. A nearby farmer discovered this and ran to report it to the PLA, who immediately intercepted it and seized more than 50 submachine guns. After liberating Xingguo, this PLA unit seized the opportunity to capture Jiangkou, an important town northeast of Ganzhou, cutting off the escape route to the east for the Kuomintang remnant bandits.

The PLA, advancing along the Gan-Yue highway on the west bank of the Gan River, defeated the enemy's resistance south of Suichuan and seized the opportunity to capture Tangjiang, a stronghold on the Xiang-Gan highway, cutting off the enemy's westward retreat.

The remnant bandits in Ganzhou, terrified by the PLA's massive pincer attack, abandoned the city in haste on the morning of the 13th and fled south. When the PLA's vanguard troops just reached the opposite bank of the Gong River in the east of Ganzhou, ferry workers immediately sailed the three steamships they had managed to preserve to welcome them. Columns of students, workers, and citizens welcoming them immediately thronged both sides of the dock. People held up all kinds of welcome banners, the most eye-catching of which was a giant portrait of Chairman Mao. After the PLA entered the city, the whole city was filled with cheers. People cheered and sang to their heart's content because the long dark night of the Kuomintang bandit gang's rule had finally passed, and now it was truly dawn.

In order to quickly pursue and wipe out the Kuomintang remnant bandits fleeing south, a part of the PLA that liberated Ganzhou continued to advance south in two routes. The western route first captured Nankang, and then joined forces with the Xiang-Yue-Gan People's Guerrilla Force, which had been fighting behind enemy lines for a long time, to liberate Dayu. The southeastern pursuit army also successively captured Xinfeng, Longnan, Qiannan, Anyuan, and Dingnan, and joined forces with the Xiang-Gan-Yue People's Guerrilla Force, which had been persisting behind enemy lines for a long time, in Qiannan.

At the same time, the PLA advancing east from Ganzhou liberated Yudu by crossing mountains and ridges, and then advanced along the Gan-Min highway, successively liberating Huichang and Ruijin, the site of the Central Government during the Land Revolution War.

The PLA advancing west from Ganzhou marched along the Xiang-Gan highway, successively liberating Shangyou and Chongyi.

　　半月席卷赣南地区
  　开辟直捣广州道路
  　前线记者报导进军赣南经过
    【新华社华中前线七日电】前线记者报道人民解放军进军赣南，半个月内歼敌五千余，解放县城十四座的经过称：人民解放军于八月中旬沿赣江两岸向赣南进军。由于解放军的英勇善战，艰苦奋斗克服困难，由于解放军获得了阔别十五年的老解放区广大人民的热烈支援，解放军在十五天的短时间内，即席卷赣南地区，解放赣南军事重地赣州，开辟了今后直捣国民党残余匪帮巢穴广州的前进道路。
    沿赣江东侧泰（和）银（坑）公路前进的解放军，解放了土地革命战争时代的老解放区模范县兴国。当地居民家家户户莫不兴高彩烈，互相奔告解放军到来的消息：“我们的亲人回来了！”居民群众自动把粮食从很远的地方冒着酷暑送来供应解放军。当解放军前进追歼逃敌时，农民们都自动为部队带路和侦察。有一次一只敌人的木船掉队了，附近一个农民发现后就跑来报告解放军，解放军当即加以截获，缴获冲锋式枪五十多支。该路解放军于解放兴国后乘胜一举攻克赣州东北的重镇江口，切断了国民党残匪向东逃跑的道路。
    沿赣江西岸赣粤公路前进的解放军，在遂川以南击溃匪军抵抗，并乘势攻占湘赣公路据点塘江，斩断匪军西窜退路。
    赣州残匪慑于我军巨大钳击威力，十三日晨仓卒弃城南逃。当解放军先头部队刚进抵赣州城东贡水对岸时，轮渡工人立即把他们设法保存下来的三只汽船开过来迎接。学生、工人、市民的欢迎行列随即拥塞码头两岸。人们举着各式各样的欢迎旗帜，最引人注目的是一幅毛主席的巨像。解放军进城后，全城欢声沸腾。人们尽情地欢呼着，歌唱着，因为国民党匪帮统治的漫长黑夜已经过完了，现在真是天亮了。
    为着迅速追歼向南逃窜的国民党残匪，解放赣州的解放军一部，分两路继续南进。西路首先攻克南康，接着与长期坚持敌后斗争的湘粤赣人民游击队胜利会师，解放大庾。东南追击大军亦连克信丰、龙南、虔南、安远、定南等城，并于虔南与长期在敌后坚持的湘赣粤人民游击队会师。
    与此同时，自赣州东进的解放军，穿山越岭解放了雩都，接着又沿着赣闽公路前进，先后解放会昌及土地革命战争时代中央人民政府所在地的瑞金。
    自赣州西进的解放军沿湘赣公路挺进，先后解放了上犹、崇义两城。
