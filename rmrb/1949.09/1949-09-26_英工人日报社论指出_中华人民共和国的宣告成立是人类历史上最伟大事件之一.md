　　Xinhua News Agency, Prague, September 25th: The "Worker's Daily" published an editorial on September 23rd entitled "A Glorious Event," stating:
    "The proclamation of the People's Republic of China is the greatest event of this century after the Russian Revolution, and one of the greatest events in human history.
    "Progressive people everywhere, especially those in colonies still needing to win independence from imperialists, will greet this news with great enthusiasm.
    "This new republic, based primarily on the worker-peasant alliance, will establish a truly independent China, carry out extensive land reform to every corner of this vast country, eliminate illiteracy, industrialize the nation, and eliminate China's unbelievable poverty.
    "This achievement was only obtained after years of arduous struggle against the landlords, the corrupt Kuomintang bureaucratic group, and foreign imperialists.
    "Firstly, the establishment of this republic demonstrates that the US dollar is not omnipotent.
    "Billions of dollars were poured into China to aid the reactionaries. A massive army was equipped and trained by Americans.
    "As a result, all these profit-seeking forces, who had no policy other than repression, were crushed and utterly defeated by the Chinese people led by the Communist Party.
    "The British government should learn a lesson from the failure of American imperialism, should recognize the People's Republic of China without delay, and withdraw British troops from Hong Kong."
    The editorial said: Some Americans hope to strangle the People's Republic of China with a blockade. In fact, this is more likely to ruin British traders than to hinder the new republic.
    The editorial also said: "The People's Republic should be recognized, and the recognition of the remnants of the Kuomintang bandit gang—enemies hated by the ordinary people of China—should be completely rescinded."
    "Let the British government be first this time, rather than last, to conclude a long-term agreement with this new republic. The era of trade based on unequal terms is dead, but there is still an opportunity to vigorously develop trade on an equal footing. Let us seize this opportunity now."

　　英工人日报社论指出
    中华人民共和国的宣告成立是人类历史上最伟大事件之一
    【新华社布拉格二十五日电】九月二十三日工人日报发表题为“光荣的事件”的社论说：
    “中华人民共和国的宣告成立是我们这一世纪仅次于俄国革命的最伟大的事件，而且是人类历史上最伟大事件之一。
    “各地的进步人民，首先是那些尚须向帝国主义者赢取独立的殖民地的人民，将以满腔热情来接待这一个消息。
    “主要是以工农联盟为基础的这个新的共和国，将建立一个真正独立的中国，把广泛的土地改革进行到这一广大国家的每一角落，消灭文盲，使国家工业化并消灭中国的令人无法置信的穷困。
    “这一成果只是在反对大地主，反对国民党腐化官僚集团，反对外国帝国主义者的多年艰苦斗争之后才获得的。
    “首先，这个共和国的成立表明，美元并不是万能的。
    “倾注在中国以援助反动派的美元达数十亿。由美国人装备和训练了庞大的军队。
    “结果下来，所有这一切除了实行镇压之外便毫无其他政策的唯利是图的势力，被共产党所领导的中国人民所粉碎而一败涂地。
    “英国政府应该从美国帝国主义的失败中学得教训，应该毫不迟延地承认中华人民共和国和将英军撤出香港。”
    该社论说：有些美国人希望以封锁来绞杀中国人民共和国。事实上，这件事之毁灭英国贸易商要比阻碍新人民共和国的可能大得多。
    该社论又说：“人民的共和国应该予以承认，对于国民党匪帮——中国普通人民所憎恨的敌人——的余孽的承认，应该全部撤消。”
    “让英国政府在这一次首先而不是最后与这个新共和国订立一个长期协定吧。依据不平等条件而贸易的时代已经死去了，但是仍然有机会可以强有力地发展平等基础之上的贸易。让我们现在就抓住这个机会吧。”
