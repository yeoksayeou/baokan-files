　　Pangjiabao Mine Destruction Incident
  　Chahar Provincial Government Conducts Deep Self-Criticism
  　Agrees with North China Government's Decision, Sincerely Accepts Punishment
  　Will Launch Cadre-Led Ideological Self-Criticism Linked to Practical Realities
    [Chahar News] The Chahar Provincial People's Government's self-criticism regarding the destruction of the Pangjiabao Mine is as follows: The Pangjiabao Mine of the Longyan Iron Mine was a guerrilla zone during the Liberation War. Because we lacked the ability to protect it, many villagers within dozens of miles relied on destroying the mine's equipment for a living. After liberation, although the provincial government sent people to guard it and ordered Longguan and Xuanhua counties to organize armed escorts, due to the insufficient understanding of industrial construction among our cadres at all levels, coupled with the deep-rooted guerrilla habits of the masses, the destruction and theft had not ceased by the end of June this year. For example, half of the 77,000-volt large iron frame of the mine was stolen; of the high-voltage transmission lines, about 140,000 meters remained when we were liberated, aside from what had already been destroyed, but by the end of June, less than 50,000 meters remained; the destruction of electric motors was even more tragic, two 150-horsepower converters were dismantled, leaving only two empty frames, and even the angle iron from the substation was taken to make iron plates for carts. This has added serious difficulties to the future restoration and development of the mine.

    The occurrence of this heartbreaking incident is mainly due to the following reasons:

    1. Cadres lack a long-term vision for construction and a sense of cherishing state property, and have not completely reversed the destructive thinking of the past. As a result, they were negligent and 麻痹 in the protection of the mine, paid no attention to the work of eliminating traitors and preventing theft, and did not educate the local masses, so that after liberation, unlawful elements and backward masses continued to destroy the mine for as long as ten months. Secondly, due to the poor quality of a small number of cadres, in order to seek personal gain, or starting from the interests of small units, they did not hesitate to violate the law, disregarded government bans, condoned and harbored destructive elements, and even personally engaged in destruction. This kind of bad behavior should have been punished in a timely manner, but due to our bureaucratic work style, we failed to discover it early and give them the punishment they deserved. In addition, some cadres have a one-sided mass viewpoint, and out of pity for a few奸商 and backward farmers, they turned a blind eye to the destructive incidents, believing that "it doesn't matter if these poor people get some iron to exchange for food," so they often dealt with destructive elements casually, letting them off after a few days of detention, which made bad people unscrupulous, and the destruction became even more serious.

    2. From a leadership perspective, the provincial government's bureaucratic work style has actually condoned destructive elements and helped the development of destructive incidents. In March of this year, the provincial government discovered the destruction of the Pangjiabao Mine and issued instructions and orders to the Chahar South Administrative Office and Longguan and Xuanhua counties to protect the mine. However, because we lacked a clear industrial construction ideology and did not fully understand the seriousness of the destruction of the mine, and because we did not realize that the order itself could not solve the problem, we did not take concrete and effective measures, nor did we conduct an in-depth inspection. This irresponsible attitude towards state property fully demonstrates the seriousness of bureaucracy; this bureaucracy has corroded the leadership of the provincial government. Many responsible cadres are busy with trivial paperwork every day, do not carefully study the instructions from higher levels, and do not check, supervise, or understand the situation below, so they cannot always maintain a clear mind and care about the overall national cause, which has caused serious damage to state property. At the same time, the bureaucracy of the leadership has also fueled the liberalism of the lower levels. For example, regarding the destruction of the Longyan Iron Mine, the provincial government ordered the administrative office and county government to protect it three times, but the administrative office and county government always ignored it or paid no attention to it. After receiving the instructions, the Chahar South Administrative Office simply "filed it with the Industry and Commerce Section," without sending anyone to inspect or taking specific measures. Longguan, Xuanhua, and other counties treated the orders of the provincial government lightly and paid no attention to them, which is a concrete manifestation of organizational laxity and disciplinary abandonment. This work style has also contributed to the development of destructive incidents.

    We fully agree with the New China News Agency's editorial and the decision of the North China People's Government, sincerely accept the punishment from higher authorities, earnestly change our leadership style, and launch cadres at all levels to study the above two documents in light of local realities, and conduct a comprehensive self-criticism in terms of ideology and work style, so that our work can be improved, and we can be truly responsible to the people and the motherland, and not repeat the mistakes of the past.

　　庞家堡矿场被毁事件
  　察省府深刻检讨
  　同意华府决定，诚恳接受处分
  　将发动各级干部联系实际检讨思想
    【察哈尔讯】察哈尔省人民政府关于庞家堡矿场破坏事件的检讨，原文如下：龙烟铁矿庞家堡矿场，在解放战争中是游击区，因我无力保护，附近数十里村庄有很多人依靠破坏该矿设备为生。解放之后，省府虽派人看管，并责令龙关、宣化两县组织武装护卫，但由于我各级干部对工业建设认识不足，再加群众的游击习气很深，直至今年六月底，破坏偷盗事件迄未停止。如矿场七万七千伏特之大铁架，有二分之一被盗走；高压输电线，刚解放时，除已破坏者外共约有十四万余米，至六月底不及五万米；电动机破坏情况更惨，两部一百五十马力的变流机，拆得只剩两个空架子，甚至拆下变电所的三角铁去做大车上的铁瓦，这使今后恢复与发展矿产增加了严重的困难。
    这一痛心事件的发生，主要有以下几个原因：
    一、干部思想上缺乏远大的建设眼光与爱护国家财产的观念，对过去的破坏思想尚未完全扭转过来。因之在矿产的保护上疏忽麻痹，对除奸防盗工作不加注意，对当地群众不做教育，以致在解放后又遭不法分子与落后群众持续破坏竟达十个月之久。其次，由于少数干部品质恶劣，为了贪图私利，或者从小单位的利益出发，不惜知法犯法，蔑视政府的禁令，纵容包庇破坏分子，甚至亲自动手破坏；这种恶劣行为本应及时受到惩罚，但由于我们的官僚主义作风作祟，未能及早发觉，及时的给以应得的处分。另有一部分干部存在着片面的群众观点，为了怜悯几个奸商与落后的农民，对破坏事件漠然视之，置若罔闻，认为“这些穷人弄点铁换点粮食吃不算什么”，因之对破坏分子常常了草从事押几天就算了，这样使坏人肆无忌惮，破坏也就愈加严重。
    二、从领导上讲，省政府的官僚主义作风实际上宽纵了破坏分子，帮助了破坏事件的发展。今年三月间，省政府即发现庞家堡矿场被破坏的情况，曾对察南专署、龙关、宣化等县发过保护该矿的指示与训令；但因我们缺乏明确的工业建设思想，对该矿破坏的严重性认识不足；更没有认识命令本身并不能解决问题，因而也就未做具体的有效措施，更未进行一次深入的检查。这种对国家财产不负责任的态度，充分表现了官僚主义的严重；这种官僚主义腐蚀了省政府的领导机构。许多负责干部，每日忙于琐碎的文牍事务工作，不细心研究上级指示，不去检查督促与了解下边的情况，因而也就不能经常保持清醒的头脑，关心全盘的国家事业，致使国家财产受到了严重的损失。同时领导上的官僚主义又助长了下边的自由主义，如省政府关于龙烟铁矿的破坏问题，三令专署、县府保护，但专县始终置诸不理，或者不加注意。察南专署接到指示后，以“交工商科存查”了事，既不派人检查，又无具体措施；龙关、宣化等县对省府命令均以等闲视之，未予注意，这又是组织松懈、纪律废弛的具体表现，这种作风同样的助长了破坏事件的发展。
    我们完全同意新华社的社论与华北人民政府的决定，诚恳地接受上级处分，认真地转变领导作风，并发动各级干部联系当地实际情况，切实学习以上两个文件，从思想上作风上进行全盘的检讨，务使我们的工作改进一步，为人民祖国切实负责，不再重复过去的错误。
