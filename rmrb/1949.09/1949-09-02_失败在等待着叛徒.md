　　Failure Awaits the Traitors

The Soviet government's reply on August 29th to the Yugoslav government's note regarding territorial claims on Austria once again, with indisputable historical facts, mercilessly tore off the mask made of deceit and slander by the Tito clique in front of the people of the world and the Yugoslav people, revealing the dirty faces of traitors and national betrayers.

The Tito clique's betrayal of the interests of the Slovene people and the Yugoslav nation, and its shameless and despicable slander of the Soviet Union to cover up this crime, has aroused the righteous indignation of world democratic public opinion. Newspapers and social figures in various parts of China have also strongly condemned the Tito gang. Reading the Soviet government's third statement to the Yugoslav traitors on the 29th, we feel it is truly after our own heart. This statement is a superb political essay. It thoroughly exposes all the despicable acts of the Tito traitorous clique in betraying faith and acting as an imperialist puppy. It expounds the Soviet Union's consistent and correct policy based on the fundamental principles of Marxism-Leninism, clearly distinguishing between right and wrong, and between friend and foe. It is one of the best textbooks for dissecting the words and deeds of traitors.

From this note, people can see how shameless and malicious the Tito clique is, constantly clamoring and barking at the socialist and democratic camp they have betrayed. The Yugoslav government, occupied by this group of traitors, colluded with imperialism two years ago behind the back of the Soviet Union and sold out the interests of the Slovene people in Austria – how shameful! In contrast, the Soviet Union's position is so consistently firm and clear: "The Soviet Union upholds the integrity of Austria, and also supports the necessity of modifying Austria's borders in favor of Yugoslavia." But the Tito clique, which had already colluded with imperialism, was obviously afraid to fight for the interests of its own nation. They were merely trying to create excuses to slander the Soviet Union and curry favor with imperialism. Now all these conspiracies have been completely exposed.

The end of all counter-revolutionary groups is shameful and tragic, and the end of the traitor Tito clique will be even more shameful and tragic.

In fact, the current Yugoslav government has already joined the Marshall Plan, acting as a new diner at Wall Street, and directly supporting the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Consequently, as the US State Department spokesman already stated on December 9th last year, Yugoslavia has immediately become a part of the overall US plan to develop world trade, and the United States is extremely interested in trade with Yugoslavia. Moreover, as US officials have revealed, US imperialism is eager to use the Tito clique to strengthen the US position in the "Cold War" against the Soviet Union. Even Tito himself has already admitted that he wants to maintain Yugoslavia as an "agricultural country supplying raw materials"? This means that the Tito clique has unabashedly confessed to its crime of betraying the country. Compared with the secret betrayal of the interests of the Slovene people, these are truly two mutually illuminating puppet shows. These fully demonstrate that the Tito clique in Yugoslavia is moving towards a sad and desperate situation, more shamefully adopting various methods to try to arouse despicable chauvinistic sentiments among the people, in order to evade the responsibility for the rapidly deteriorating crisis at home, and more shamefully offering national interests with both hands to the imperialist bloc "in order to maintain anti-Soviet sentiment and war hysteria." This tragic path to failure and death is the old path taken by all counter-revolutionary groups, and the Tito clique will only walk faster, more tragically, and fail more thoroughly on this path.

However, we firmly believe that the Yugoslav people will surely win victory. The Soviet note is a great education and encouragement to the Yugoslav people who are struggling. The Yugoslav people will see clearly that their struggle will never be isolated. The people of countries in the international democratic camp, headed by the Soviet Union, including China, are enthusiastically supporting the Yugoslav patriots in their struggle for liberation. Whether on a global scale or within China, no traitor will ever have a good end. Twenty-two years ago, the Chinese revolution encountered a great traitor, Chiang Kai-shek. After him, a group of small traitors such as Wang Jingwei and Zhang Guotao appeared. They all once harmed the people's cause with extreme ferocity, but they have all been overthrown by the people one by one. Although the situation of the patriotic people of Yugoslavia today is temporarily serious, we believe that the Yugoslav traitors, like snowmen under the sun, cannot last long. The overall environment in which the Yugoslav people find themselves, especially the international environment, is much better than when the Chinese people were betrayed by Chiang Kai-shek and Wang Jingwei in the summer of 1927. Therefore, the work of the Yugoslav people in replacing their leaders will certainly be able to achieve victory faster than us. We hope the people of Yugoslavia will work hard!

### 失败在等待着叛徒

　　失败在等待着叛徒
    苏联政府八月二十九日答复南国政府关于对奥领土要求的照会，再一次以无可置辩的历史事实，在全世界人民和南国人民面前，无情地揭下了铁托集团以欺骗和毁谤所制成的假面具，露出叛徒和卖国贼的肮脏的嘴脸。
    铁托集团出卖斯洛文族利益和南斯拉夫民族利益，以及为了掩盖这一罪恶而厚颜无耻、卑鄙龌龊地诽谤苏联的鬼把戏，已经激起了世界民主舆论的义愤。中国各地的报章和社会人士，也对铁托匪帮纷纷予以痛斥。这时我们读了苏联政府二十九日对南斯拉夫叛徒们的第三次声明，更觉得实获我心。这个声明是一篇绝妙的政治论文。它对于铁托叛逆集团背信弃义，甘当帝国主义小狗的一切卑劣行为，痛快淋漓地揭穿无遗。它依据马列主义基本观点阐述了苏联一贯的正确政策，是非分明，敌我分明。它是解剖叛徒言行的最好的教科书之一。
    从这个照会中，人们可以看到铁托集团是那样的寡廉鲜耻，那样的心怀恶意，竟不断地吵吵嚷嚷，向着它们自己所背叛的社会主义与民主阵营狂吠不休。被这一班叛徒所占据的南斯拉夫政府，瞒着苏联，在两年前勾结帝国主义，出卖了奥国境内斯洛文族的利益，那是多么可耻呀！而与此相反，苏联的立场则是这样一贯的坚定和明确，“苏联维护奥地利的完整性，同时也支持对奥地利的疆界作有利于南斯拉夫的修改的必要性”。但是早已勾结了帝国主义的铁托集团显然是早已不敢为本民族的利益斗争了，他们只是企图制造借口，以诋毁苏联，博取帝国主义的欢心。现在这一切阴谋都已经被彻底地拆穿了。
    一切反革命集团的结局都是可耻的和悲惨的，而叛徒铁托集团的结局将更为可耻和更加悲惨。
    事实上现在的南斯拉夫政府既已参加了马歇尔计划，充当华尔街的新食客，直接支持北大西洋公约，那末，其结果，不仅完全象去年十二月九日美国务院发言人所已经声明的那样，南斯拉夫立即成为美国发展世界贸易整个计划的一部分，美国对于对南斯拉夫的贸易极感兴趣，而且正如美官方人士所透露，美帝国主义是亟欲利用铁托集团以加强美国对苏“冷战”中的地位。就连铁托自己不是也已经承认要保持南斯拉夫为一个“供应原料的农业国家”了吗？这就是说，铁托集团已经毫不隐讳地供认了他们卖国的罪状。这同秘密出卖斯洛文族的利益一事相较，真是互相辉映的两出傀儡剧。这些充分地表示南斯拉夫的铁托集团正在走向可悲的绝望之境，更加可耻地采取各种方法企图在人民中激起可鄙的沙文主义情绪，借以摆脱它们对国内迅速恶化的危机所应负的责任，更加可耻地将民族利益双手捧献于帝国主义集团之前，“以利于保持反苏情绪和战争的歇斯底里”。这一条走到失败与死亡的悲惨的道路，正是一切反革命集团所走的老路，而铁托集团在这条路上只会走得更快，更悲惨，失败的更彻底。
    但是，我们坚信南斯拉夫人民一定会获得胜利的，苏联的照会对于正在斗争中的南斯拉夫人民正是一个极大的教育和鼓舞。南国人民是会看得清楚的，他们的斗争是永不会孤立的。以苏联为首的国际民主阵营的国家人民，包括中国在内，都在热烈地支持南国爱国者争取解放的斗争。无论就世界范围说，就中国范围说，无论什么叛徒，断然没有好的下场。二十二年前，中国革命曾遇到一个大叛徒，这就是蒋介石。在他以后，又出现了汪精卫、张国焘等一批小叛徒。他们都曾经穷凶极恶地危害人民事业，但是他们都已被人民所一一推翻。南斯拉夫的爱国人民今天所处的环境虽然暂时是严重的，但是我们相信，南斯拉夫叛徒们，好象太阳底下的雪人一样，是不能维持长久的。南斯拉夫人民所处的整个环境特别是国际环境，要比中国人民在一九二七年夏天被蒋介石汪精卫所叛卖时是好得多，因此，南斯拉夫人民更换他们的领导者的工作，也一定能比我们有更快的胜利。希望南斯拉夫的人民努力！
