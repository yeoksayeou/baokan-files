Guaranteeing the People's Livelihood in Beiping
An Overview of the Beiping Trading Company's Supply Work in the Past Six Months
Xiao Disheng, Wang Jing

Beiping is a consumer city with a population of two million. Therefore, the supply work of the Trading Company is directly related to the lives of the people of Beiping. In the past six months, through institutions such as cooperatives, it has supplied daily necessities such as grain and cloth at fair prices, basically guaranteeing the livelihood of the people of Beiping.

I. Primarily Solving the Living Supply of Most Workers, Staff, and Students

After liberation, the Trading Company immediately launched supply work for workers and students in conjunction with cooperatives (at that time, the main supplies were grain, followed by coal, oil, and salt). In order to ensure the basic living needs of employees and students, distribution was carried out according to consumption ratios: 45 jin of grain per person per month for workers (one-third fine grain, two-thirds coarse grain), 40 jin per person per month for students and public school employees (later changed to 45 jin, one-quarter fine grain, three-quarters coarse grain), and 35 jin per person per month for employee family members (10 jin of fine grain). To facilitate and give preferential treatment to cooperative members, it was stipulated that cooperatives could sell grain on credit, with payments made every five days and settlements every ten days.

As of August 31, the Trading Company supplied a total of 27,580,000 jin of grain, 15,700 tons of coal, and 170,000 jin of oil to 361,077 members of 141 employee cooperatives in the city (including over 230,000 family members). It also supplied 295 government agencies and organizations, 336 universities and schools, and 26 private factories, totaling 100,564 people. The total supply was 12,860,000 jin of grain, 32,941 tons of coal, and 275,649 jin of cooking oil.

II. Universal Retail Supply to General Laboring Citizens

In order to meet the living needs of ordinary citizens, the Trading Company universally retailed grain in the market. In February, it entrusted 45 private merchants to sell grain on its behalf. By May, this had grown to 359, with a total of 12,686,500 jin of grain sold on behalf of the company. This entrusted sales method played a certain role in supplying the citizens' living needs. However, due to the company's insufficient education and supervision of private merchants, some unscrupulous merchants engaged in sabotage, stealing and selling grain, falsifying accounts, adulterating goods, and deceiving the public to obtain illegal profits. For example, Yongda Flour Mill stole 71,800 jin of wheat from the Trading Company and used the money to speculate in gold and silver, disrupting the financial order. Jin Shengyuan Grain Store extracted over 30,000 jin of No. 1 and No. 2 flour from 240,000 jin of wheat from the Trading Company, supplementing it with dark flour; and extracted over 22,000 jin of large, good grains from 100,000 jin of red sorghum, mixing in small grains to make up the difference. The sabotage by these unscrupulous merchants prevented citizens from enjoying the benefits they were entitled to, which seriously affected the relationship between the Trading Company and the masses. After reports from the masses and inspections by the Trading Company, the government punished the most serious lawbreakers and criticized and educated those with minor offenses.

In view of the fact that the sales agent method could not completely solve the problem of citizen supply, the Trading Company gradually stopped the agency sales. The Grain Branch Company divided the city into districts, established twelve business offices and twenty-six retail stores, and directly handled retail sales. In this way, the masses were able to obtain grain at fair prices. The general feedback was that the quality was better than before, and the prices were fair. By the end of August, a total of over 11,600,000 jin of grain, over 34,000 jin of cooking oil, and over 26,000 tons of coal had been sold.

In addition, department stores and cotton cloth retail departments were established to supply citizens with other daily necessities.

III. Market Wholesale to Regulate Supply and Demand

In addition to direct supply, the Trading Company also sold grain and cotton cloth on the market, both to regulate supply and demand and stabilize prices, and to supply processing, production, and retail merchants. In the past six months, the main materials sold on the market included: over 81,089,800 jin of grain, over 43,000 bundles of cotton yarn, over 186,000 bolts of cloth, over 250,000 jin of alkali noodles, over 80,000 jin of cooking oil, and over 20,000 gallons of gasoline and kerosene.

In addition, the Trading Company directly supplied factories and workshops with various raw materials for production in exchange for their products. It supplied over 105,000 bundles of cotton yarn, dyed over 52,700 bolts of white cloth, 231,900 jin of tobacco leaves, over 51,000 jin of alkali noodles, as well as other colors, paper, matches, soap, and other raw materials.

IV. Fair Supply Prices

The Trading Company had collected over 30,000,000 jin of grain from southern Hebei, central Hebei, and the northern Yue areas to supply Beiping before the liberation of Tianjin and Beiping. After liberation, large quantities were transported from the Northeast and Northwest. These were all expressions of the support and assistance of the broad masses of farmers to the newly liberated areas. Although the quality of the grain was not uniform, it played a significant role in ensuring the livelihood of the working people.

In order to take care of the lives of the working people, the Trading Company set separate prices for purchases by workers, students, and public school employees, which were usually lower than market prices. During price fluctuations, prices did not rise, but remained fixed for a certain period of time, so that the masses would not suffer losses during price fluctuations. Taking the prices on June 8 as an example:
                                Market Wholesale Price    Trading Company Price    Comparison Lower
Wheat Flour (per bag)	                4000	                       3600	                             11.11%
Millet (per jin)	                 51 (surface)             38 (yellow millet)	             34.21%
Corn Flour (per jin)	                  46	                      34	                             35.29%
Millet Flour (per jin)	                  48	                      42	                             14.29%

In addition, the actual selling price to cooperatives was 4% lower than the stated price, and the price to government agencies and schools was 2% lower (preferential treatment). If we calculate that the Trading Company supplied over 40,000,000 jin of grain to cooperative agency groups in the past six months, and that the price per jin was on average 20% lower than the market retail price, then the amount of grain that the working people were spared from intermediate exploitation was approximately 8,000,000 jin.

V. Problems Encountered and Resolved

(1) Procedural Problems: At the beginning of grain supply, the Trading Company encountered many problems in procedures due to a lack of experience (especially insufficient contact with cooperatives). For example, employee consumer cooperatives could not directly deal with the Grain Branch Company to purchase grain, but had to go to the Supply and Marketing Cooperative to approve the purchase and complete the procedures before they could pick up the grain from the warehouse. As a result, the grain pick-up address might be far away, and the round-trip transportation formed the "grain parade", increasing many unnecessary expenses. Later, after the merger of the Cooperative Business Section and the Grain Branch Company's Wholesale Section, this bias was corrected and the procedures were simplified. Subsequently, the Xuanwumen Cooperative Warehouse was established to facilitate the cooperative's grain pickup. In terms of the types and quality of grain, the Trading Company tried to make them as good and complete as possible, and stipulated the ratio of coarse and fine grains to be distributed.

(2) Retail Issues: Retail regulations stipulated that no more than ten jin per person could be purchased, but because of free purchase, it was discovered that some speculators were using children and family members to purchase grain. The working citizens, on the other hand, could not buy it due to lack of time. Therefore, the Supply and Marketing Cooperative actively organized laboring people's cooperatives (such as tricycle workers and transportation workers) in order to be able to supply them in a planned way. The rest of the poor laboring citizens (such as private factory workers, poor citizens, and families of revolutionary martyrs) could enjoy a lower price than the Trading Company's retail price by presenting a purchase certificate issued by the district office, police station, and trade union, and could buy grain for several days at a time. This can reduce the purchase of speculators, and maintain an appropriate difference between the wholesale price and the retail price, reducing the excessive intermediate exploitation of the market.

　　保障了北平人民生活
　  北平贸易公司半年来供应工作概况
    萧涤生、王敬
    北平是一个拥有二百万人口的消费城市，因此，贸易公司的供应工作，直接关系北平人民的生活，半年来，通过合作社等机构，以公平的价格，供应粮布等日用必需品，基本上保证了北平人民的生活。
    一、首先解决了大部工人、职员、学生的生活供应
    解放后，贸易公司即结合合作社展开对工人、学生的供应工作（当时供应物资主要是粮食，其次是煤、油、盐），为了保障职工、学生的一定生活需要，按照消费比例，实行配售：工人每人每月定量为粮食四十五斤（细粮三分之一，粗粮三分之二），学生及公教人员每人每月四十斤（后改为四十五斤，细粮四分之一，粗粮四分之三），职工家属每人每月三十五斤（细粮十斤）。为便利优待合作社社员，并规定各合作社可赊销粮食，五天一交款，十天一结帐。
    截至八月三十一日止，贸易公司对全市一百四十一个职工合作社的社员三十六万一千零七十七人（其中家属二十三万余人），共供应粮食二千七百五十八万余斤，煤炭一万五千七百余吨，油十七万余斤，并供应了机关团体二百九十五单位，及大、中学校三百三十六个，私营工厂二十六家，计十万零五千六百四十八人。共供应粮食一千二百八十六万余斤，煤炭三万二千九百四十一吨，食油二十七万五千六百四十九斤。
    二、普遍零售供应一般劳动市民
    贸易公司为了供应一般市民的生活需要，在市面上普遍零售粮食，在二月里曾委托四十五家私商代售粮食，至五月份已发展到三百五十九家，共代售粮食一千二百六十八万六千五百余斤，这样委托代售，在供应市民生活所需上起了一定作用。但是，由于该公司对私商的教育检查不够，某些不法商人从中捣鬼，盗卖粮食，伪造帐目，搀杂使假，欺骗公家，以获非法利润。如：永大制粉厂盗卖贸易公司小麦七万一千八百斤，用此款去倒卖金银，扰乱金融。晋生源粮店从贸易公司的二十四万斤小麦中提取一二号粉三万余斤，另补以黑面；从十万斤红粮中提取好大颗粒二万二千余斤，搀入小粒顶数等。这些不法商人的捣鬼，使市民得不到应享的利益，因而严重的影响了贸易公司和群众的关系。经过群众的检举和贸易公司的检查，对严重的不法分子，政府进行了处罚；对较轻者进行批评教育。
    贸易公司鉴于用代售方法，不能完全解决市民供应问题，于是逐渐停止了代售。由粮食分公司按区划分，设立了十二个营业所和二十六个零售店，直接办理零售，这样群众才得到了公平价格的粮食。普遍反映质量较前提高，价格公道，截至八月底共售出粮食一千一百六十余万斤，食油三万四千余斤，煤炭二万六千余吨。
    另外，又分别设立了百货和花纱布的门市部，以供应市民的其他日用品。
    三、市场批发调剂供求
    贸易公司除直接供应外，并在市场出售粮食纱布。一面达到调剂供求稳定物价，一面供给加工生产及零售商。半年来在市场出售的主要物资计有：粮食八千一百零八万九千八百余斤、棉纱四万三千余捆、布十八万六千余匹、碱面二十五万余斤、食油八万余斤、汽油煤油二万余加仑。
    此外，贸易公司并直接供给工厂作坊各种生产原料，换取其生产品。计供给棉纱十万零五千余捆、白布染色五万二千七百余匹、烟叶二十三万一千九百余斤、碱面五万一千余斤、以及其他颜色、纸张、火柴、肥皂等原料。
    四、供应价格公平
    贸易公司的粮食在平津未解放前便从冀南、冀中、北岳等地调集了供应北平的粮食三千余万斤，解放后从东北、西北调运大批。这都是广大农民支持与帮助新解放区人民的表现。虽然粮食的品质不整齐，但在保障劳动人民生活上，是起着很大的作用。
    贸易公司为照顾劳动人民的生活，对工人、学生、公教人员等的购买品是单独另定价格的，通常较市价低。在物价波动中，定价并不随涨，要坚持一定时间，使群众在物价波动中不受损失。以六月八日物价作比：市场批发价格  贸易公司价格　　　比较低通粉（袋）  ４０００　３６００　１１．１１％小米（斤）　５１（伏地）　３８（黄小米）３４．２１％玉米面（斤） ４６　３４　３５．２９％小米面（斤）　４８　４２  １４．２９％
    另外在实际售给合作社时比定价再低百分之四，机关团体学校减低百分之二（优待）。如按半年来贸易公司供应合作社机关团体的粮食四千万余斤计算，以每斤价格比市场零售价平均低廉百分之二十计，则劳动人民少受中间剥削的数目约为八百万余斤粮食。
    五、发生与解决的问题
    （一）手续问题：贸易公司在开始粮食供应之初，因缺乏经验，（特别是与合作社联系不够密切），手续上发生很多问题。如职工消费合作社购粮，不能单独与粮食分公司发生关系，必须先到供销总社去批购粮食，办好手续才能到仓库取粮，结果，取粮地址可能距离很远，来回取运，形成了粮食的往返游行，增加很多不必要的开支。后来，合作社业务科和粮食分公司合作批发科合并办公后，纠正了这个偏向，手续简化了。继又建立了宣武门合作仓库，以方便合作社的取粮。在粮食的种类与品质上，也尽量要好要全，并规定粗细粮配售的比例。
    （二）零售问题：零售规定每人不超过十斤，但因自由购买，发现了有些投机商人利用儿童家属去套购，劳动市民反因缺乏时间买不到。因此供销合作总社便积极组织劳动人民（如三轮车工人、运输业工人）合作社，以便能有计划的供应。其余一部劳动贫苦市民（如私营工厂工人、贫苦市民、军干烈属等）经区公所、派出所、工会等介绍，开购买证，可凭证享受比贸易公司零售价较低的待遇，并能一次买几天的粮食。这样可以减少投机商人的套购，且保持批发价与零售价的适当差额利润，减少市场过高的中间剥削。
