A Day of Carrying Coal
    Wang Shiqi
    I am an intellectual who came from the old society. Influenced by the old society in the past, I never personally participated in labor, and as a result, developed the idea of ​​despising labor. Now the red flag of labor, like the sun, shines upon our heads. In order to directly participate in production and respond to Chairman Mao's call for "an inch longer in production," I decided to devote my evenings to carrying coal in small coal pits, in addition to my daytime job as an accountant at the Yuhua Mine Pharmaceutical Factory.
    September 1st, a memorable day in my personal life, I carried my basket, stepping into the slanting sunset of Xian Mountain, and went to the "Dong Yuji Coal Pit" to carry coal. When everyone arrived, we began to drill into the pit. When I got to the big arc (Note 1) and looked, I immediately felt half-hearted. The ladder was so steep and deep that you couldn't see the bottom at a glance. The top was very low, and the bottom was wet and slippery. After taking two steps, my legs trembled. I thought, even an empty person can't walk down, how can I come up with a hundred pounds of coal on my back? While hesitating, a companion said, "Go down and try carrying it once." At this time, I was dazed, and with a hesitant mood, I followed everyone step by step and felt my way down. When I arrived at the working face (Note 2) at the bottom, my companions helped me load my basket with coal first. They lifted it up, asked me to put it on my back, lit my lamp (Note 3), and told me, "Don't worry, walk slowly!" I was embarrassed not to carry it, gritted my teeth, and carried the weight I had never borne in my life, walking on the narrow and bumpy pit road. My legs kept trembling, and I gasped in my mouth. When I got to the root of the big arc, I found a high ridge, supported the basket, and took a rest. When I looked up, I saw the tall and distant ladder, and I was worried again. When I looked at my companions, one by one was happily, vying to go up and down in the kiln. Those going up carried twice as much coal as me, and walked so steadily. Those coming down sang ditties in their mouths, and their steps were so light. I thought, "I'm not less than anyone!" "If others can do it, I can do it!" With a burst of energy, I finally carried a basket of coal to the pithead.
    While resting, thinking about my situation just now and comparing it with others, the thought of despising laborers in the past was defeated by this realistic labor. After the rest, I immediately picked up the basket, fixed the lamp, and drilled into the kiln again. It was really a miracle. This time my legs didn't tremble, and the road didn't seem so far and difficult to walk, and the weight I carried also increased by several kilograms. After this labor experience, I am even more convinced that only the working people are the creators of the world. (Note 1) Big arc: the ladder leading down from the entrance of a small kiln. (Note 2) Working face: the place where coal is mined inside the kiln. (Note 3) Everyone working in the kiln carries a carbide lamp, which lights up when water is added.

　　背煤一日记
    王士琦
    我是一个从旧社会中来的知识分子，过去在旧社会的影响下，从没亲身参加过劳动，并由此养成了轻视劳动的思想。现在劳动的红旗，象太阳一样展耀在我们头上。为了直接参加生产，来响应毛主席“生产长一寸”的号召。我决定除了白天在裕华矿药厂当司帐外，抽出晚上的时间上小窑背煤。
    九月一日，这一个个人生活史上可纪念的日子，我背起了篓子，踏着衔山的斜阳，上“东毓记煤窑”去背煤；等到人来齐了，开始钻窑，到了大弧（注一）上一看，立时凉了半节。一眼望不到底，又陡又深的梯道，上面很矮，下面又湿又滑，下了两步，腿直哆嗦，心想，空身人往下走都走不了，再背上百十斤煤，如何能上来呢？正在犹疑，一个同伴说：“下去吧，背一回试试”。我这时蒙蒙＠＠的，怀着犹豫的心情，一步一步跟着大家摸了下去。到了下边掌子（注二）上，同伴们帮忙我把我的篓子先装上了煤，搬起来，招呼我背上，给我放亮了灯（注三），嘱咐着说：“不用着急，慢慢的走吧！”我不好意思不背了，咬着牙，背着平生未负过的重量，走上了狭窄坎坷的窑道，腿是不住的颤，嘴里呼呼的喘。走到了大弧根，找着高坎，撑住篓子歇了一歇，一抬头，望见又高又远的梯子，又发愁了；再一看同伴们，一个一个兴高彩烈的、争先恐后，在窑里往来上下，上去的背着比我多一倍的煤，走的是那么稳，下来的口里唱着小调，脚下是那样的轻快。我想，“我比人家不少什么！”“别人干的了，我就干的了！”一鼓气，终于把一篓子煤背上了窑口。
    休息的时候，想着自己刚才的情形，和别人的情形对比一下，以往藐视劳动者的思想，就从这一现实的劳动中被打垮了。休息完了以后，马上拾起篓子，整好了灯，又钻进了窑口，真是奇迹一样，这一回腿也不颤了，道也似乎不那么远而难走了，而且背的分量还增加了好几公斤。经过了这个劳动的体验，更坚信：只有劳动人民才是世界的创造者。（注一）大弧，小窑入口向下去的梯道。（注二）掌子，窑内出煤的地方。（注三）在窑内工作每人自带一个电石灯，放水就亮。
