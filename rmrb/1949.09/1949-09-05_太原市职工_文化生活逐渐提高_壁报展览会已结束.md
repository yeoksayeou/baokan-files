　　Taiyuan City Workers'
  　Cultural Life Gradually Improves
  　Wall Newspaper Exhibition Concludes
    [Taiyuan Dispatch] The first large-scale wall newspaper exhibition for workers in Taiyuan City after liberation has concluded. Twenty-six state-owned factories participated in the exhibition with thirty-one wall newspapers. In the three months since Taiyuan's liberation, the broad masses of workers have not only achieved political liberation and secured their livelihoods, but have also seen new improvements and developments in their cultural lives. The exhibition opened on August 10th and was organized by the Taiyuan Office of the North China Federation of Trade Unions. The wall newspapers reflected the various situations of workers in state-owned factories, such as actively restoring production under new labor attitudes, adjusting wages, worker solidarity, and trade union work. A large number of people visited, with statistics showing over five thousand visitors in one week. Workers from various factories in Taiyuan took turns visiting in organized groups. The Taiyuan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and cultural and educational organizations formed a judging committee to select the wall newspapers of nine units, including the No. 2 Flour Mill, as model wall newspapers based on the content of the various wall newspapers, the comprehensive degree of the current central work, and their guiding significance for the thoughts, lives, and labor of the workers.
