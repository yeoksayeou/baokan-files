"A Moment's Deviation"
	Ya Qun
In his speech, Mr. Fu Zuoyi, a specially invited representative of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, mentioned that when he recently went to Suiyuan, Chiang Kai-shek sent him a telegram saying: "After the Xi'an Incident, upon returning to Nanjing, due to a moment's deviation, a great mistake leading to today's peril and demise was made" (see page 2 of this newspaper on the 24th).

This muddle-headed Chiang Kai-shek is obviously regretting that he should not have fulfilled his promise of "internal peace and external resistance" when he was detained in Xi'an. He regrets that he did not continue to compromise with the Japanese invaders, launch a large-scale civil war, and collude with the Japanese invaders to "eliminate" the Chinese Communist Party and the people's army it led.

In fact, this muddle-head's "moment's thought" at that time was hardly a sincere fulfillment of his promise. It was only because he saw that the revolutionary upsurge of the Chinese nation had reached its peak, and internal peace and external resistance had become a matter of course. If Chiang Kai-shek continued his reactionary policy of "internal pacification before external resistance," he would surely be overthrown by the people of the whole country as a traitor. That's why he put on a false pretense of resisting Japan. His calculation was very clever. He thought: First, during the War of Resistance, he could use the power of the Japanese invaders to "eliminate" the Chinese Communist Party and the people's revolutionary armed forces (the Red Army); second, he could engage in speculation and opportunism in the international arena, using international forces to defeat the Japanese invaders, while he could sit back and enjoy the fruits of victory, posing as a national hero; third, if the Japanese invaders "conquered China," wouldn't the Chinese Communist Party be eliminated by the Japanese invaders, and he could transform himself into a puppet emperor for the Japanese?

During the eight years of the War of Resistance, his constant collusion with the Japanese invaders and his desperate "anti-communism" were concrete manifestations of this "moment's thought." And the result of this "moment's thought" was that he actually enjoyed a few days of being one of the "Big Four Leaders" and won quite a lot of "American weapons" and "American dollars" as capital for his anti-people actions after the war, prolonging his reactionary life. The only "difference" was that the Chinese Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army and New Fourth Army it led not only were not eliminated by the Japanese invaders during the arduous and heroic eight-year War of Resistance, but became stronger and stronger, growing dozens of times in size.

Naturally, what Chiang Kai-shek regrets and is most heartbroken about to this day is this point. But, if this muddle-head had not had this "moment's deviation" at that time and had instead followed Wang Jingwei's path, he would have perished along with Wang Jingwei long ago. From this point of view, Chiang's "moment's thought" back then was not "deviated" at all.

However, today he regrets that he "deviated," and so, "international volunteer forces are being organized, and Japanese air force volunteer teams are being organized..." He begs the remnants of Japanese fascism to slaughter the Chinese people, openly acting as an unprecedentedly brazen traitor.

Is this "moment's thought" "deviated" or not? Both are anti-people and traitors, so there is no question of deviation or non-deviation.

### “一念之差”

　　“一念之差”
    亚群
    中国人民政协特邀代表傅作义先生的发言中曾提到最近他去绥远时，蒋介石给他一个电报说：“当年西安事变回到南京后，由于一念之差，竟铸成今日之危亡大错”（见二十四日本报第二版）。
    蒋介石这昏虫，显然是在追悔他当时不应该实行在西安被扣时的“对内和平，对外抗战”的诺言，追悔他当时没有继续和日寇妥协，大打内战，会同日寇“消灭”中国共产党及其领导的人民军队。
    其实，这昏虫当时的“一念”，又何尝是诚意地履行诺言呢，不过看见当时中华民族革命的怒潮已达到了顶点，对内和平，对外抗战，已成为天经地义的要求，假如蒋介石再继续所谓“攘外必先安内”的反动政策，一定要被全国人民当汉奸打倒，所以才来了一个假抗战。这算盘是打得很如意的。他以为：第一，在抗战中，借日寇的力量“消灭”中国共产党及其领导的人民革命武装（红军）；第二，在国际上投机取巧，借国际的力量打败了日寇，自己却可以坐享其成冒充民族英雄；第三，如日寇“征服中国”，则中国共产党被日寇消灭，岂不是自己还可以摇身一变而为日寇的儿皇帝吗？
    八年抗战中，他一面不断地和日寇勾勾搭搭，一面拼命地“反共”，也即是这“一念”的具体表现。而这“一念”的结果，居然自己也过了几天“四大领袖之一”的瘾，并赢得若干多的“美械”，“美元”，作为战后反人民的资本，延长了自己底反动生命；所“差”的只是中国共产党及其领导的八路军、新四军，在坚苦卓绝的八年抗战中，不但未被日寇消灭，而且愈战愈强，壮大了几十倍。
    自然，蒋介石至今引以为最“差”的，最伤心的，也就是这一点了。但，假如这昏虫当时没有这“一念之差”，而同样地走汪精卫的道路，也早已同汪精卫一起完蛋了。由此看来，蒋贼当年底那“一念”，还是并不“差”的。
    然而，他今天痛悔“差”了，于是，“国际义勇军组织起来了，日本空军志愿队组织起来了……”。拜请日本法西斯的残渣来屠杀中国人民，明目张胆地作空前绝后的大汉奸。
    这“一念”“差”不“差”呢？同样是反人民，作汉奸，没有什么差不差的问题存在。
