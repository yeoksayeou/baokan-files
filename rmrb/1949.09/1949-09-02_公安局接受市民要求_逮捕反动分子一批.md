　　Public Security Bureau Accepts Citizens' Requests
  　Arrests a Batch of Reactionaries
    [Reported by this newspaper] The Public Security Bureau, accepting the citizens' requests to severely punish unrepentant reactionary party and league members, has arrested and punished those who refused to register or were not honest in their confessions after registration, as well as those who still attempted to abscond after registration. Among those arrested last week were: Yan Pingfan, the Deputy Commander of the pseudo-National Defense Minister’s Cheng Zong Column, who refused to register; Chen Haiyuan, a member of the Central Statistics Bureau (Zhongtong) and a clerk in the pseudo-Foreign First Police Precinct, who frequently suppressed revolutionary activities and tortured revolutionary martyrs; Hu Xianqing, an executive committee member of the Kuomintang Sixth District Party Department; Han Mian, a propaganda section member of the Hebei Provincial Party Department; and Li Xiangdong of the Democratic Socialist Party, among others, who were arrested for not confessing honestly. Those arrested for not handing over their organizations include Zhang Daochun, the secretary of the Kuomintang 23rd District Party Department (Municipal Government), the pseudo-Municipal Government Land Administration Bureau Director, and a member of the Zhongtong, as well as Nie Yingqiu, the pseudo-Mayor of Yingkou City. In addition, Cui Zhiqiang, a Zhongtong member who was originally a Zhongtong group leader, was also detained in the Fourth Precinct for encouraging the intelligence agents in his group not to confess honestly after registration and for prohibiting others from discussing his continued role as the leader of the 11th Zhongtong Student Movement Group at China University after leaving Gao Shang. Furthermore, Liu Guilin, the secretary of the Kuomintang Tenth District Party Department, fled to Changping after registration, and was apprehended and escorted back from Changping and detained in the Third Precinct.
