　　Establish a Correct Ideology, Strictly Implement Standardized Training
　　Li Jian, Chief of Staff of the Special Forces Corps of the North China Military Region

　　Following the successive promulgation of military flag and emblem orders by the Military Commission and Military Region, and the launch of the regular standardization movement training directive, the historical mission of building our People's Liberation Army has begun to enter a new stage of complete standardization. This is the result of our army's heroic and victorious battles, the victory and development of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu's military thought, and signifies that our army, in entering the period of the People's Democratic Dictatorship and the People's Democratic Republic, will use new military standards of standardization and modernization to defend our sacred People's Democratic Republic. This is a glorious, great, and arduous historical task in the construction of our army. We should, under the call of the Military Commission and the leadership of the Military Region, immediately begin our standardization training work with a serious and firm spirit. To provide some ideas for conducting this great training task with ideological preparation, steps, and methods, the following suggestions are offered:

　　I. The Significance of the Standardization Movement

　　The People's Liberation War has won a decisive victory nationwide. To carry the revolution through to the end, to resolutely eliminate the remnants of the reactionary military forces, and to safeguard the new democratic state power, it is necessary to build a fully standardized and modernized people's national defense armed force, making it a reliable guarantee for the peaceful labor and production construction of the people of the whole country. That is to say, with the establishment of the People's Democratic Republic and the advancement from an agricultural country to an industrial country, we must follow the direction of the Soviet Union's army building, accept the Soviet Union's advanced experience in building a modern national defense army, vigorously strengthen equipment training under the conditions of gradually improving industrial standards, and move towards the standards of a highly standardized and modernized national defense army. This will enable our People's Liberation Army, on the basis of its indomitable combat effectiveness tempered in hundreds of battles, to improve its scientific and technological level and its regular military literacy, and become a powerful and invincible national defense force of a strong New Democratic country. This is the basic significance of why we are conducting the standardization movement.

　　On the other hand, it must also be recognized that our People's Liberation Army was in a rural, dispersed guerrilla environment for a long time, and therefore became contaminated with guerrilla habits. Troops and cadres lacked regular military literacy and lacked the habit of abiding by regular systems and unified standards. This was unavoidable in the historical stage of the past rural guerrilla environment, and even insurmountable. But now the environment has changed, with a nationwide victorious environment, certain industrial conditions, and the task of safeguarding a strong New Democratic country. Under this new situation, in order to complete our army's new historical mission, strengthening the regular standardization movement, thoroughly eliminating the bad phenomena of disorganization, indiscipline, and anarchy, and improving concentration, unity, organization, discipline, modern technical level, and regular level has become an urgent and great task for our People's Liberation Army.

　　So, what is the ideological essence of the standardization movement advocated by our People's Liberation Army? It is to take the interests of the people as the premise, the proletarian ideology as the foundation, and under the guidance of the great Mao Zedong military thought, through certain forms of unified organization, system, standards, regulations, teaching manuals, and rules, to cultivate a high degree of concentration, unity, organization, discipline, and a high level of military technology, high work efficiency, and combat capability in the army's institutions, equipment, organization, training, combat, and even daily life style and habits, thereby improving our army's modernized and standardized combat capability and serving the people more powerfully, and safeguarding the national defense of the motherland. Our army's standardization requirements are based on the ideological foundation of proletarian class consciousness, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, and are carried out with a glorious struggle history and army building experience. This is a principled and essential distinction from the counter-revolutionary ideological essence of the reactionary Kuomintang bandit army and even any reactionary army, both domestic and foreign, as well as their deceptive, imitative, and superficial regular forms. Therefore, it is completely wrong to confuse the standardization movement of our People's Liberation Army with the standardization of the Kuomintang reactionary bandit army, and it is a completely erroneous viewpoint that ignores the essential difference between a revolutionary army serving the people and a counter-revolutionary army oppressing the people.

　　II. Important Marks of the Standardization Movement

　　First, it is necessary to establish a high degree of standardized ideology, that is, all commanders and fighters must have standardized ideological literacy. And based on this ideological literacy, they can develop a serious and meticulous attitude and style towards everything—from combat, army building, and training to daily life and rest.

　　Second, the whole army must have a high degree of organization and discipline, with uniform steps and consistent actions. At any time, in any place, any commander or fighter must be strict in discipline.

　　Third, universally and thoroughly implement and cherish the unified military flag and emblem, cherishing the military flag and emblem as if cherishing our own lives, and even sacrificing our lives to protect the military flag and emblem, just like the Soviet Red Army cherishing the red flag.

　　Fourth, unify various organizations and institutions, and be able to handle affairs (work, command) according to organizational structures, systems, and procedures, like a machine, overcoming the事務主義(事務主義 is the practice of focusing on trivial or routine matters, rather than strategic goals or objectives.) and handicraft methods of grabbing things at random according to personal interests and guerrilla habits.

　　Fifth, unify various systems and standards. That is, from large to small, from combat to construction and training, from political work to staff work and logistics work, a set of systems, rules, regulations, and teaching manuals suitable for our army's standardized requirements should be formulated to unify requirements, standards, and norms.

　　Sixth, be serious about military appearance and discipline, that is, cultivate uniformity and clear rewards and punishments in daily work and military life.

　　Seventh, regular etiquette, demonstrating the class friendship, unity, and mutual assistance of our People's Liberation Army.

　　Eighth, a strict superior-subordinate relationship and a clear distinction between service and non-service relationships.

　　Ninth, a high sense of time and strict and accurate adherence to time.

　　Tenth, all work and life should be orderly, planned, and regular, step by step, with accurate plans and tight organization.

　　Eleventh, each should perform their duties and fulfill their responsibilities, and everyone should be able to be loyal to their duties and complete their tasks.

　　III. Launching the Standardization Movement, Strictly Implementing Standardized Training

　　To effectively respond to the call of the Military Commission and Military Region, it is necessary to earnestly launch a mass standardization movement. On the basis of this improved understanding, persistent and unremitting strict standardization training must be carried out to gradually achieve practical results in improving standardized literacy. To this end:

　　First, it is necessary to solve the problem of ideological understanding, that is, to launch an education on establishing standardized ideology throughout the army. The establishment of this standardized ideology is the foundation for a series of standardized training, construction, and combat in the future. To establish this ideology, it is necessary to link it with the overall direction of national construction and army building in the future national situation, and conduct repeated and profound education so that all commanders and fighters understand that we are not only a fighting force forever, but also a modern, regular national defense army with high scientific and technological literacy and high standardized literacy, so that all commanders and fighters have a sense of honor and progressive demands for defending a strong new China. To this end, it is also necessary to simultaneously oppose the backward, conservative, and non-progressive empiricist viewpoints, as well as the individual escapist viewpoints that are willing to degenerate and leave the sacred post of the glorious national defense army, and resolutely wage an uncompromising struggle against various guerrillaist ideas and habits.

　　Second, it is necessary to improve the standardized literacy of cadres at all levels, first grasping the decisive link of improving cadres first, and training cadres at all levels, especially middle and lower-level cadres, through various effective methods. Thoroughly correct the guerrilla thinking, style, and habits of cadres, and effectively improve the basic military literacy of cadres (from living habits to management training and combat command) by one step, so that they have the capital and the possibility to improve the standardized literacy of the entire army. This is a prerequisite, which is decisive for the standardization of the entire army, and the leadership must concentrate its efforts to solve this problem.

　　Third, it is necessary to improve our training ideology and methods. In training ideology, we must step-by-step and resolutely implement the Soviet Suvorov's famous saying of "training without pity." We must adopt serious (of course, reasonable) training discipline. Step-by-step and with focus, thoroughly and completely correct guerrilla habits, styles, and any phenomena of indiscipline and disorganization in all aspects. Only in this way can we truly lay a veritable foundation in a fundamental way. This is an arduous and upright training process. We must open up our minds, cadres must set an example, and persist with perseverance and resilience, engage in strict work, be serious and meticulous, and only then will it be possible to achieve real results. In addition, in terms of training methods, we must change the past blitzkrieg approach, start from a long-term perspective, and divide into years, seasons, or phases, step-by-step from general basic coaching to specialized training, from formal coaching to combat coaching, and from management training to technical training. In terms of guiding requirements, we should adhere to cadres first and then soldiers, practice first and then proficiency. It is best to be one by one, not greedy, not impatient, focusing on repeated hard training, not practicing until effective, not practicing until proficient, so that it becomes a style, habit, and literacy. Only in this way can we lay the foundation and improve literacy.

　　Fourth, it is necessary to transform the staff organs, and first of all, improve the standardized literacy and modern military science level of the staff organs. Without this, it will be difficult to solve the problem of our army's standardized training and construction. It is impossible to have backward, guerrilla staff organs that can train a modern, regular army. Therefore, leaders at all levels should consider investing capital and time, and pay attention to transforming and cultivating the existing staff institutions, which are relatively backward and accustomed to fighting but not accustomed to training, from the organization of personnel, training and education, and working methods, and effectively improve them so that they can adapt to the requirements of long-term standardized training and construction in the future.

　　树立正规思想，严格正规训练
    华北军区特种兵团参谋长  李健
    随着军委、军区相继颁发军旗、军徽命令及开展正规统一运动训令后，我人民解放军建军的历史任务，已开始走上了新的完全正规化的阶段。这是我军英勇奋战胜利的结果，是毛主席朱总司令建军思想的胜利与发展，是标帜我军在进入人民民主专政的人民民主共和国时期，将以正规的、现代化的新的军事水准，来捍卫我们神圣的人民民主共和国。这是我军建设上光荣伟大而又艰巨的历史任务。我们应在军委号召与军区领导下，以严肃而坚定的魄力，立即着手开始我们的正规化训练工作。为了有思想准备、有步骤、有方法的进行这一伟大训练任务，提供以下几点意见：
    一、正规化运动的意义
    人民解放战争，已在全国范围内赢得了决定的胜利，为了将革命进行到底，为了坚决肃清反动派的残余军事力量，保卫新民主主义的国家政权，必须建设一支完全正规化与现代化的人民国防武装，使它成为全国人民和平劳动与生产建设之可靠保证。这就是说，我们要随着人民民主共和国的建立，随着农业国向工业国的前进，必须追随苏联的建军方向，接受苏联先进的建设现代化国防军的经验，在工业水准逐渐提高的条件下，大力加强装备训练，向高度正规化、现代化的国防军标准前进。使我人民解放军在百练成钢的顽强战斗力基础上，提高科学技术与正规军事素养水平，成为新民主主义强国的强大无敌的国防力量。这就是我们为什么要进行正规化运动的基本意义。
    又一方面，还要看到我人民解放军过去曾长期处在农村分散的游击环境，因而沾染了游击习气，部队及干部缺乏正规军事素养，缺乏遵守正规制度及统一制式的习惯。这在过去农村游击环境的历史阶段是不可免的，甚至是无法克服的。但现在环境变了，有了全国胜利的环境与一定工业条件及保卫新民主主义强国的任务。在此新形势下，为了完成我军新的历史任务，加强正规统一运动，彻底肃清无组织、无纪律、无政府的恶劣现象，提高集中、统一与组织性、纪律性及现代技术水平与正规水平，已成为我人民解放军迫切而伟大的任务。
    那么，我人民解放军所提倡的正规化运动的思想本质是什么呢？就是以人民利益为前提，以无产阶级思想为基础，在伟大的毛泽东建军思想指导下，通过一定形式的、统一的组织、制度、制式、条令、教范、规章，而在军队的机构、装备、编制、训练、作战以至日常生活的作风、习惯上，养成高度集中性、统一性、组织性、纪律性及高度的军事技术水平与高度的工作效率与战斗能力，从而达到提高我军现代化正规化的作战能力，更强有力的为人民服务，保卫祖国的国防。我军正规化的要求，是在无产阶级阶级觉悟的思想基础上、毛泽东思想指导下，而且已经有光荣斗争历史与建军经验的情况下进行的，这和反动的国民党匪军以至中外任何反动军队的反革命思想本质及欺骗、因袭专尚表面的正规形式，是有原则的，本质的严格区别的，所以，如果把我人民解放军的正规化运动与国民党反动匪军的正规化混为一谈是完全错误的，是完全忽视了为人民服务的革命军队与压迫人民的反革命军队两者之间的本质区别的错误观点。
    二、正规化运动的重要标志
    首先，要树立高度的正规思想，就是全体指战员要有正规的思想素养。并能基于这一思想素养的基础，养成对任何事物——从作战、建军、训练到日常生活作息——有严肃不苟的态度和作风。
    其次，全军要有高度的组织性、纪律性，步调整齐，行动一致。任何时候，任何场合，任何指战员要人人作到纪律严明。
    再次，要普遍彻底执行与爱护统一的军旗、军徽，爱护军旗、军徽犹如爱护我们自己的生命一样，甚至为爱护军旗、军徽，不惜供献自己的生命，如象苏联红军爱护红旗那样。
    第四，统一各种编制、组织，并能按组织机构、制度、手续办事（工作、指挥），象一架机器一样，克服按个人兴趣、游击习气乱抓的事务主义与手工业方式。
    第五，统一各种制度及各种制式。就是由大到小，由作战到建设、训练，由政治工作到参谋工作、后勤工作，都制订出一套适合我军正规要求的制度、规章、条令、教范，以统一要求，统一制式、统一标准。
    第六，严肃军容、军纪，就是要在日常工作与军事生活上养成整齐划一，赏罚严明。
    第七，正规的礼节，表现我人民解放军的阶级友爱，团结互助。
    第八，严肃的上下级关系，与严格区分服务非服务间关系。
    第九，高度的时间观念，与严格准确的遵守时间。
    第十，一切工作、生活有秩序、有计划、有规律，按步就班，计划准确，组织严密。
    第十一，各称其职，各尽其责，人人能尽忠职守，完成任务。
    三、开展正规化运动，严格正规训练
    要有效的响应军委、军区的号召，必须认真的开展群众性的正规化运动，在这一提高认识的基础上，进行顽强的、持久不懈的严格正规训练，才能逐步收到提高正规素养的实效。为此：
    首先，要解决思想认识问题，就是要在全军内展开一个树立正规思想的教育。这一正规思想的树立，是决定今后一系列正规训练、建设、作战的基础。要树立这一思想，必须要联系今后全国局面的建国、建军总方向，进行反复的深刻的教育，使全体指战员人人了解，我们不仅永远是一个战斗队，而且要成为有高度科学技术与高度正规素养的现代化正规国防军，使全体指战员人人有保卫强大新中国的光荣感与进步要求。为此还必须同时反对落后保守不求进步的经验主义观点，及个别的甘愿堕落脱离光荣的国防军神圣岗位的逃兵观点，以及坚决与各种游击主义思想、习惯作不退让的斗争。
    其次，要提高各级干部的正规素养，首先抓住先提高干部这一决定环节，以各种有效方法，训练各级干部，首先是中下层干部。彻底纠正干部的游击思想、作风、习惯，切实的把干部的基本军事素养（从生活习惯到管理训练及作战指挥）提高一步，然后才有资本，才有可能提高全军的正规素养。这是一个先决的前提条件，是对全军正规化有决定性的，领导上必须集中精力来解决这个问题。
    再次，要改进我们的训练思想与方法。在训练思想上，必须有步骤的、有决心的贯彻苏联苏沃洛夫的“训练不怜惜”的名言。要采取严肃的（当然是合理的）训练纪律。有步骤、有重点的彻底全部纠正各方面的游击习气、作风与无纪律、无组织的任何现象。只有这样，才能真正从基本上打下名符其实的基础，这是一个艰苦的、严正的训练过程。必须打通思想，干部以身作则，有毅力、有韧性的坚持下去，严格从事，认真不苟，才有可能收到真实效果。此外，在训练方法上，必须改变过去的突击办法，从长期打算着眼，分年分季或分期，有步骤的由一般基础教练而分科专练，由制式教练而战斗教练，由管理训练而技术训练。在指导要求上，应坚持先干部而后战士，先切实而后熟练。最好一个是一个，不贪多，不厌烦，着重反复苦练，不切实不止，不熟练不止，使之成为作风习惯素养而后已。只有这样，才算打下了基础，提高了素养。
    第四、要改造参谋机关，首先要提高参谋机关的正规素养及现代化军事科学水平。不如此，即难能解决我军的正规训练建设问题。不会有落后的、游击的参谋机关，而能训练出现代化的正规的军队来。因此，各级领导上应考虑下本钱、费时间，从组织人选上、训练教育上、工作方法上各方面来重视改造培养现有的、较落后的、习惯于打仗、不习惯于训练的参谋机构，切实提高起来，使能适应今后长期正规训练建设的要求。
