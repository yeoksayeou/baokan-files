Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 29th: Regarding the telegram from Xinjiang authorities Tao Zhiyue and Burhan, etc., announcing their break from the Guangzhou Kuomintang remnant government, three Xinjiang representatives attending the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference today issued the following statement:

　　As we are participating in the first plenary session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in Beijing, we have learned that Tao Zhiyue, former commander of the Kuomintang Xinjiang Garrison, and Burhan, chairman of the Xinjiang Provincial Government, have led Xinjiang military and government personnel in issuing a telegram declaring their break from the Guangzhou Kuomintang reactionary government and their allegiance to the people's democratic camp. We believe that this statement, which meets the demands of the people, is correct and also represents the wishes of the people of Xinjiang.

　　For many years, the people of Xinjiang, including the people of the already liberated Ili, Tacheng, and Altay (Ashan) three districts, have been fighting for freedom and liberation. Thanks to the victorious support of the People's Liberation Army, they have achieved peaceful liberation and express their heartfelt gratitude.

　　Under the leadership of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China and the soon-to-be-reorganized Xinjiang Provincial Government, the people of Xinjiang firmly guarantee to strive to the end to build a new democratic China. The people of the three districts, who have been opposing the reactionary Kuomintang government in Dihua (Ürümqi) for the past few years, and who will now strive for the freedom of the people of the entire region in a peaceful environment, firmly guarantee that they will be able to work together with the people of the entire province to build a new democratic Xinjiang to the very end.

   【新华社北京二十九日电】对于新疆当局陶峙岳鲍尔汉等通电脱离广州国民党残余政府一事，出席政治协商会议的三位新疆代表，于今日发表声明如下：
    我们在北京正参加中国人民政治协商会议第一届全体会议之际，听到了前国民党新疆警备总司令陶峙岳和新疆省政府主席鲍尔汉率领新疆军政人员发表通电，脱离广州国民党反动政府、归向人民民主阵营的声明，我们认为这种符合人民要求的声明是正确的，也是新疆人民的愿望。
    多年以来，为争取自由解放而奋斗的新疆人民，包括已解放的伊犁、塔城、阿山三区人民在内，由于人民解放军胜利的支援，和平的获得了解放，衷心表示感激。
    新疆人民在中华人民共和国中央人民政府和行将改组的新疆省政府领导下，坚决保证为建设新民主主义新中国而努力奋斗到底。几年来反对迪化国民党反动政府，而今后在和平环境下，为全疆人民的自由而奋斗的三区人民，坚决保证必能和全省人民一道，为建设新民主主义的新新疆而奋斗到底。
