　　Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Front, 19th—The People's Liberation Army liberated Pingtan Island and Nanri Island, the last remaining strongholds of the Kuomintang bandit army in the southeast sea off Fuzhou, on the 16th. Part of the People's Liberation Army crossed the Meizhou Bay on the night of the 12th and occupied Meizhou Island. On the 15th, they took advantage of the victory and launched an attack on the outer sea. At 3:00 AM on the 16th, they liberated Nanri Island, located at the mouth of Xinghua Bay southeast of Putian. Another part of the People's Liberation Army landed on Pingtan Island on the evening of the 15th and completely occupied the island after clearing out the remaining bandits on the morning of the 16th. The results of the battle are currently being investigated.
    Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Front, 19th—Late news: More than 900 men of the 325th Division of the 121st Army of the Kuomintang army remnants, led by the division commander Lü Shengwu and deputy division commander Chen Yanlian, staged an uprising in the Guanqiao and Yuntai areas of Nan'an County in southern Fujian on August 18th, joining the People's Liberation Army. When Fuzhou was liberated, the Kuomintang bandit gang ordered the division to retreat from the Nan'an area to Kinmen Island. The officers and soldiers of the division, in view of the continuous victories of the People's Liberation Army and the imminent final elimination of the remaining bandits, refused to retreat and staged an uprising to join the People's Liberation Army. The unit has now been ordered by the Fujian Military Region of the People's Liberation Army to proceed to a designated location for reorganization. It is noted that the 325th Division of the 121st Army was originally the 45th Division of the Kuomintang Army's newly formed Fifth Army, which was completely annihilated in the Huaihai Campaign. This time, it was rebuilt after being annihilated.

　　福州东南海上残匪最后肃清
  　我克平潭南日两岛
    国民党军师长吕省五率部起义闽南
    【新华社福建前线十九日电】人民解放军于十六日解放国民党匪军在福州东南海上的最后残余据点平潭岛及南日岛。解放军一部于十二日夜渡过湄州湾，攻占湄州岛后，十五日乘胜向外海出击，十六日晨三时解放莆田东南兴化湾口之南日岛。另部解放军则于十五日晚登陆平潭岛，十六日上午肃清残匪，将该岛完全占领。战果正清查中。
    【新华社福建前线十九日电】迟到消息：国民党军残部一二一军三二五师九百余人于八月十八日在该师师长吕省五、副师长陈言廉率领下于闽南南安县官桥、云台地区举行起义，参加人民解放军。福州解放时，国民党匪帮曾命令该师自南安地区退守金门岛，该师官兵鉴于解放军的节节胜利，残余匪帮即将最后被肃清，乃拒绝撤退，举行起义，参加人民解放军。该部现已奉人民解放军福建军区命令，开赴指定地点，进行整编。按一二一军三二五师原系国民党军新编第五军之四十五师，在淮海战役中已被全歼，此次系被歼后重建者。
