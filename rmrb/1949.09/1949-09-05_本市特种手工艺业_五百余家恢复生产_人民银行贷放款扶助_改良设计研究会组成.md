    【新华社北平四日电】北平特种手工艺业，经中国人民银行北平分行贷款二千七百余万元扶助后，已有五百七十八家工厂、作坊恢复生产。获得贷款者计十七业、三百零五户，包括地毡、挑补花、玉器、纸绒花、珐琅、象牙、铜锡器、雕漆、刺绣、烧瓷、骨器、镶嵌、石木雕刻、银蓝、花丝、料器、玉树等。北平分行为了执行各界代表会发展北平生产的决议，近正与有关机关详细研讨扶植特种手工艺的具体办法。北平特种手工艺产品是重要出口品行销欧美各国。中国人民银行北平分行在八月底办理的四千七百八十余万元打包放款，亦间接予该业以很大帮助。
    又：为帮助北平特种手工艺改良成品，清华大学建筑系、社会学系、人类学系、文物陈列室、北京大学博物馆、午门历史博物馆、中国营造学社、特种手工艺联合会、仁立毛纺公司等单位特于月前合组北平特种手工艺改良设计研究会，决定作成种种样品，在北大博物馆展览，以供国内外订货之用。
