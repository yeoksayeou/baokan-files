Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 14th: Mexico City Dispatch: The Pan-American Peace Conference, which opened here on September 5th, closed on the 11th. At the evening session on the 10th, the final resolutions and declaration were adopted. The resolution stated that monopoly capital should be held responsible for failing to fulfill the promises made during the war. The resolution called for cooperation between major powers, especially between the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom. At the same time, it pointed out the necessity of opposing the activities of warmongers and demanded a halt to the arms race. The resolution also called on the people of Latin America to thwart the actions of monopolists who intend to keep them in a subordinate position, pointing out that it is necessary to develop independent industries and trade with the world, and pointing out that maintaining the unity of industrial and agricultural workers is indispensable in their struggle for rights.

At the last few conferences, representatives from various countries continued to deliver speeches. Toledano, Chairman of the Latin American Labor Federation, said that this was the first conference of progressive forces in the Americas to discuss major political issues in the Western Hemisphere. Some people in Europe spread the opinion that Latin America follows the political leadership of the United States on all decisive political issues. The conference proved the error of this opinion. Chilean poet Neruda said: The kings of Wall Street will not be able to rely on Latin American countries to carry out their aggression plans. Pauling, the head of the U.S. delegation, pointed out that the conference proved the growing desire for peace among the people of the Americas who are determined to oppose a new war. The task of American peace defenders is to immediately establish a national peace defense committee to unite all peace forces in the United States. Johnsen, the education officer of the Communist Party of New York State and a U.S. representative, brought congratulatory messages from the now-tried leaders of the American Communist Party, and said that the Pan-American Peace Conference has opened a new stage in the development of the peace struggle in the Americas. The people of the world, including the American people, do not want war. French poet Éluard sent congratulations to the conference on behalf of the Standing Committee of the Paris World Peace Congress.

　　美洲和平大会闭幕
  　号召南美人民反对美帝奴役
    【新华社北平十四日电】墨西哥讯：九月五日在此间开幕的美洲和平大会已于十一日闭幕。在十日晚的会议上，通过了最后的决议和宣言。决议称：垄断资本对于未能履行战时所作的诺言一事，应负责任。决议号召大国之间特别是苏美英之间的合作，同时，指出反对战争贩子活动的必要，并要求停止军备竞赛。决议并号召拉丁美洲的人民挫败垄断资本家意图使他们处于依附地位的行动，指出必须发展独立的工业和对全世界的贸易，指明保持产业工人和农业工人的团结，是他们在争取权利的斗争中所不可或缺的。
    在最后几次大会上，各国代表继续发表演说。拉丁美洲劳工联合会主席托列达诺说，这是第一个讨论了西半球重大政治问题的美洲进步力量的大会。某些人在欧洲散布一种意见，说拉丁美洲在一切决定性的政治问题上都追随美国的政治领导。大会证明了这种意见的错误。智利名诗人尼鲁达说：华尔街的大王们将不能依靠拉丁美洲国家进行他们的侵略计划。美国代表团团长保灵指出大会证明决心反对新战争的美洲各国人民对和平的愿望日增。美国和平保卫者的任务是，立即成立全国保卫和平委员会，以团结美国的一切和平力量。美国代表纽约州共产党教育干事约翰逊带来现在受审的美共领袖的贺电，并说美洲和平大会开辟了美洲和平斗争发展的新阶段。世界人民，包括美国人民在内，不要战争。法国名诗人艾吕霞代表巴黎世界和平大会常委会向大会致贺。
