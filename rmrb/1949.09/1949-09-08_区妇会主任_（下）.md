　　Joining the Revolution
　　In the 26th year of the Republic of China (1937), I heard that the Japanese devils had invaded Shanhaiguan, and the soldiers (Kuomintang army) were retreating southwards in a flurry. People were as panicked as if they were being trampled by horses. The Huang Ya family also ran to the city, so I went back to my aunt's house.

　　Soon a female soldier came to the village, wearing a purple floral calico dress and speaking very kindly. Later, when we became familiar with her, everyone called her Comrade Li. She lived in my aunt's house and often talked to me about this and that, and what she said felt like a window opening in my heart. One day, she called a general meeting of all the women in the village. At the meeting, she talked a lot about things like equality between men and women, organizing to resist Japan, but I can't remember it all now. Anyway, at that time, I felt that what she said was exactly what I thought in my heart.

　　Later, I followed her to do work. What could I do? It was really like "a dog biting a hedgehog, not knowing where to start." I was also illiterate, and when I went to various villages to organize women, I couldn't even remember their names. It was so difficult that I just wanted to cry, but Comrade Li would persuade me: "Good girl, don't worry, take it slowly!" Whenever I had free time, I would learn to read with her, learning three characters a day. After a few months, I learned how to fill out a road pass!

　　At that time, I was so busy with work that I couldn't spare time to go home and see my man. Later, I learned that he was leading rent and interest reduction in the village and was poisoned to death by the landlord Zhang Qinghe with medicated wine. Others were afraid that I would be sad and didn't tell me. From then on, I remembered this blood debt and worked desperately, just waiting for the day to avenge this deep hatred.

　　The situation became increasingly tense. The devils built pillboxes everywhere, and I led the women day and night in the devil's grid, taking care of wounded soldiers, weaving military cloth, and making military shoes.

　　Once, during a large-scale mopping-up operation by the devils, I happened to have malaria. I couldn't run, so I hid in a cave. The devils pulled me out of the cave. Zhang Xingwang whispered something in the translator's ear, and without saying a word, they tied me up and took me into the city.

　　The devils used foreign dogs to bite me, poured chili water down my throat, and pressed me with levers to scare me, but I was not afraid at all. The devils had no choice but to sentence me to death. At dusk, three puppet soldiers dragged me behind the pillbox. I thought to myself: "I will die gloriously, and my comrades will avenge me." Who knew that one of the puppet soldiers also shed tears. He fired two shots into the air and kicked me into the pit. At night, I crawled and groped my way to a sesame cake shop. They looked at me with my disheveled hair and blood-stained face and were so scared that they ran into the house. Fortunately, Second Aunt's ears were sharp and she recognized my voice and came out to pull me in. From then on, I became her goddaughter and stayed at her house to recover from my injuries.

　　Comrade Li kept coming to see me at Second Aunt's house. One time, she came with a short, fat man who walked with a limp, wearing a military uniform with a Glory Medal pinned to his pocket. Comrade Li introduced him as Commissar Wang of the Veterans' School. After that man left, she whispered to me: "Do you think he is good?" I said, "Why not?" "Is he good enough for your standards?" Her words surprised me, but she chuckled, and I understood what was going on. From then on, he came often, and we found that our personalities and thoughts were very compatible.

　　My injuries were almost healed, and I asked to go back to work as soon as possible. When I returned to the district, the comrades shouted: "Heroes are matched with heroes, a glorious couple; models find models, a pair of iron eggs."

　　On August 14th, Comrade Wang came to get married, and everyone made a fuss. Everyone insisted that I report on the process of our love. What process did I have? If it weren't for the Communist Party saving me, how could I have this day? Comrade Li pulled Comrade Wang over and asked him to speak. He said: "I admire her strong will and competence. That's why I chose her." His words caused a buzz, and everyone laughed. I felt both sad and happy, like a tipped-over bottle of mixed flavors, both sour and sweet.

　　Overthrowing the Old Order
　　After the Japanese devils surrendered, our area expanded day by day, and the higher-ups transferred me to work in the new district. At first, the women were reluctant to talk about their suffering. I told them about my own experiences in detail, and this way, sorrow attracted sorrow, and they regarded me as a confidante. One day, a young daughter-in-law knocked on my door in the middle of the night and found me. As soon as she entered the house, she burst into tears like the Yellow River overflowing, and she kept talking until dawn, her eyes red like bells.

　　Once the women are awakened, their strength is not small! The young daughter-in-law, who used to blush when she saw strangers, later led the women in her village to hold general meetings. She spoke at meetings of hundreds of people, and she made suggestions at struggle sessions against the bullies. Her mouth was like a sharp knife, and she spoke with reason and logic!

　　At that time, I was the director of the women's federation in that small district, leading more than thirty villages. I was running from the front village to the back village, so busy! I just thought: "I have suffered, and the Communist Party liberated me. I must do my best to help those sisters to overthrow the old order together, and I must not forget the pain once the wound has healed!"

　　After the rectification of the Party that year, the higher-ups transferred me back to this district to carry out land reform, looking for a typical village, starting with Shuangmiao. The landlords are cunning. When they saw us go back, they tried to move their belongings out. When I told everyone about it, everyone was angry. Xiao San was the first to propose the establishment of an inspection team to take turns on guard duty.

　　On July 23rd, a village-wide meeting was convened, first to ask Zhang Qinghe to confess his past crimes. He was cunning and only said small things, not revealing the big ones. The masses remembered it clearly. Xiao San's mother trembled with anger. She said, "That year, there was a big flood, and not a single grain was harvested. You forced us to pay rent. When we couldn't pay, you beat Xiao San's father half to death and forced my daughter to be your maid." Hei Wuzi continued, "When the Japanese devils were here, you often colluded with the pillboxes. My second brother was a militiaman in the village, and you led the devils to arrest him." At this time, my mother opened her eyes wide and started to speak to Zhang Qinghe: "If my Gui Rong's father were alive, he would bite you a couple of times and still not relieve my hatred!..." The masses shouted loudly: "Send him to the People's Court!" I accepted everyone's opinion and sent him to the county that day. The masses clapped their hands and said: "Gui Rong! This time, you have eliminated a great harm for us!" I explained to the masses: "One person's strength is not enough. It is the leadership of the Communist Party, and the combined strength of everyone that makes it great!"

　　Responding to Chairman Mao's Call
　　Chairman Mao's plan is so thorough! After the poor people got land, he immediately called on everyone to "increase production by an inch" and lead the masses to become prosperous. We can't lag behind!

　　After the production instructions were issued to the district, I immediately convened the women cadres from each village to a meeting in the district to discuss how women could produce in the great production movement. After everyone discussed it, they went back to the village to help each family make production plans. Zhao Dachun's wife in Liuli Temple was initially reluctant to work in the fields, thinking that it was a man's job. Her husband was sick and couldn't grow crops. I seized on this family and talked to her: "Sister-in-law Dachun, men and women are the same. You didn't know how to do it in the past because you hadn't learned. Look at Chang Youjia in the east. She didn't know how to work in the fields in the past. Her mother-in-law beat her, and her father-in-law scolded her. Now she can hoe and sow, and her mother-in-law and her man are so happy. Who would give her a hard time anymore?"

　　These words turned her mind around. She thought about it all night, and the next day I helped her go to the fields. Gradually, she got used to it, and later she became a good worker. She never hired anyone to harvest wheat or thresh the grain. In the summer, the old hen in the family also hatched a brood of chicks. From then on, all the young and old daughters-in-law in the village carried hoes to the fields.

　　After the wheat harvest, a small weaving organization was established. Ten people were in a group, and those who could weave and spin were paired up, and work was counted according to performance: spinning four liang of cotton was counted as one work point, and weaving one zhang of cloth was counted as two work points. Everyone was very enthusiastic. In half a month, Mei Lan's group wove ten large pieces of cloth. Everyone became even more motivated when they heard the village radio praise her, and they scrambled to become labor models.

　　Seeing that we were doing a good job, the village cooperative established a women's stock, specializing in selling cotton and promoting cloth. This saved the women from having to run to the market and delaying their housework.

　　Comrade! In my district now, the women in twenty-four villages have organized autumn harvest mutual aid teams. They go to the threshing ground and the fields, deliver manure, and carry water, and they are no worse than men. The east competes with the west, and the south challenges the north, and it's all very lively!

　　September 3, 1949, in Ping.

  　参加革命
    民国廿六年，听说日本鬼子打进了关，大兵（国民党军队）一个劲往南窜，人心惶乱得象趟马蹄，黄牙老婆一家子也跑到城里去了，俺就回到了大娘家。
    不久村里来了个女兵，穿着一身紫花粗布衣裳，说话挺和气，后来混熟了，大家就都叫她李同志。她住在大娘家，常给俺说这说那，说的俺心里就象开了窗子。一天她召集全村妇女开大会，会上她讲了一大堆，什么男女平等啦，组织起来抗日啦，现在都记不清了，反正那时候觉得她说的话，都合俺的心眼。
    后来俺就跟着她跑工作，咱会做啥呢？真是“狗咬刺猬，无从下手”；咱又是个睁眼瞎子，到各村组织妇女，连人名都记不下，难的俺光想哭，李同志就劝俺：“好妹子，别心急，慢慢的来！”抽空俺就跟她学文化，一天认三个字，几个月过去，俺就学会开路条啦！
    那时候，工作忙的抽不开身，也顾不得回家看看俺男人，后来才知道他在村里闹减租减息，叫地主张庆和用药酒灌死了。别人怕我难受，不敢给我说，从那，俺就记下了这笔血帐，死劲的工作，只等着有一天，要报这个深仇。
    情况越来越紧，鬼子到处按下了炮楼，俺成天价在鬼子的格子网里，领导着妇女们照顾伤兵员，织军布，做军鞋。
    一次鬼子大扫荡，正赶上俺发疟子，跑又跑不动，就藏在洞里，鬼子从洞里把俺拉出来，张兴旺凑在翻译官的耳根子上，嘀咕了一阵，二话不说就把俺捆起来带进城里。
    鬼子用洋狗咬，辣椒水灌，杠子压，来吓唬我，我一点都不怕，鬼子没办法要枪毙我。傍黑，三个皇协军，把我拉到炮楼后面，我心里想：“死，我死的光荣，同志们要为我报仇的。”谁知里面有一个皇协军，也掉下了眼泪，他往上空打了两枪，一脚把我踢到坑里。夜里，俺连摸带爬，爬到一家卖烧饼铺门前，他们看着我披头散发，满脸是血，吓的就往屋里跑，还是二大娘耳朵灵，听出是我的声音，才出来把我拉进去。从那，俺就成了她的干闺女，一直在她家养伤。
    李同志不断到二大娘家来看我，有一次，和她一同来了个矮胖胖的男人，走路一拐一瘸，穿着一身军衣，衣袋口还别着个光荣牌牌。李同志介绍说，那是荣军学校的王政委。那人出去后，她小声问我：“你看他好不好？”我说：“怎不好？”“够不够你的条件？”这一说把俺说了个楞怔，她却噗嗤笑出来，俺就明白是怎么回事了。从此，他常来，我们俩的性情思想都很相投。
    伤养的已经差不多，我就要求赶快回去工作，回到区上，同志们嚷着：“英雄配英雄，一对子光荣；模范找模范，一双铁蛋蛋。”
    八月十四那天，王同志来结婚，大家拾掇了一阵子，就闹起来。大家非叫俺报告恋爱经过不可，俺有啥经过呢？要不是共产党救了俺，那能有今天呢？李同志又拉过王同志要他讲，他说：“我佩服她的意志坚决，又能干，因这，我相中了她。”说的大家嗡一声，都笑了起来，俺心里又难过，又高兴，真象倒了五味瓶儿，又酸又甜。
    闹翻身
    日本鬼子投降后，咱们的地区一天天扩大，上级调我到新区工作。一开头，妇女们有苦都不愿往外说，俺就把自己的事给她们一五一十的讲，这样苦水引苦水，她们就把俺当成知己人。一天，有个小三媳妇，半夜里敲开门找到我，一进屋就象黄河决了堤，一直说到天亮，两眼哭成了红铃铛。
    妇女觉悟后，力量可不小啊！以前的小三媳妇，见了生人就脸红，后来她领导那个村里的妇女开大会，在好几百人的大会上讲话，斗争恶霸会上提意见，嘴象尖刀，可说得头头是道哩！
    那时俺当那个小区的妇会主任，领导着三十几个村，前庄跑后庄，可忙活啦！咱净想：“咱受过苦，共产党解放了俺，俺可是要尽自己的本事，帮助那些姊妹一齐翻身，可不能好了疮疤忘了疼啊！”
    年时整党后，上级又把我调回本区搞土地改革，找着典型村，先从双庙做起。地主可鬼哩，看到咱回去，就往外鼓捣东西，我给大家一说，个个气呼呼的，小三第一个提议成立检查队，轮流站岗。
    七月二十三，召开了全村大会，先叫张庆和坦白过去的罪恶，他老奸巨滑，净拣小的说，大的可不往外掏，群众记的清啊，小三娘气的嘴唇发抖，她说：“那年涨大水，一个粮食粒没收，你逼着俺要租子，没翻出来你把俺小三爹打了半死，还硬逼着俺闺女给你当丫头。”黑五子接着说：“日本鬼子在时，你常和炮楼上勾勾搭搭，俺二哥在村里当民兵，你领着鬼子来抓他。”这时俺娘睁得圆圆的两眼，冲着张庆和也说开了：“要是俺桂荣爹在时，他会咬你两口也解不了俺的恨啊！……”下边群众大声喊起来：“送交人民法庭！”我接受了大家的意见，当天就把他送到县上。群众拍着巴掌说：“桂荣！你这回可除了咱们的大害啊！”俺就向群众解释：“一个人的力量可不沾，是有共产党领导，大家合伙力量才大啊！”
    响应毛主席号召
    毛主席的计划可周密哩！穷人有了地，他接着就号召大家“生产长一寸”，领导群众发家致富，咱更是不能落后呀！
    生产指示发到区上，俺马上召集各村妇干到区上开会，商量在大生产运动中，妇女怎样生产。大家讨论罢，就回到村里帮助各家订生产计划。琉璃庙赵大春的媳妇，起初不愿下地，觉得那是男人干的活，她丈夫有病不能种庄稼，我就抓住了这一家，给她谈：“大春嫂，男人和女人可是一样哩，过去不会是没有学过。你看东头常有家过去不会做地里活，婆婆打，公公骂，现在人家能锄能耩，婆婆和男人喜的了不得，谁还给她气受哩？”
    这一说，可就把她的脑筋说转啦，她寻思了一夜，第二天我就帮她下地去。渐渐地，她就惯啦，后来还成了个劳动好手哩，割麦，打场从不再雇人。在夏天，家里的老母鸡还抱了一窝子小鸡，从那全村的大闺女小媳妇，都扛着锄头下了地。
    过完麦，就成立了纺织小组织布，十个人一组，会织能纺的配搭开，按成绩计工：纺四两花算一工，织一丈布算两个工。大家做的很带劲，半月的光景，梅兰那一组就织了十个大布，大家听到村里广播表扬她，更加有了劲，抢着争劳动模范。
    村合作社见咱搞的挺热闹，就成立了妇女股，专管出卖棉花，推销布匹。这样，更省得妇女往集上跑，耽误家里活。
    同志！现下俺那个区，已有二十四个村的妇女，组织了收秋互助队，上场下地，送粪担水，比男子汉一点也不差；东头跟西头比赛，南头和北头挑战，闹的可红火哩！
    一九四九、九、三于平
