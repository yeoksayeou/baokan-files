　　Greek Reactionary Government Sentences Women's Federation Leader to Death
  　All-China Women's Federation Issues Strong Protest, Demanding Immediate Cancellation of Unreasonable Verdict
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 27th] Cai Chang, President of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, issued an urgent protest to Tsaldaris on the 26th regarding the death sentence imposed by the Greek reactionary government on Katina Taraganis, leader of the Democratic Greek Women's League. The telegram reads as follows: Xinhua News Agency Prague branch urgently forwards to Prime Minister Tsaldaris, Athens:
    From a telegram from the Secretariat of the Women's International Democratic Federation, I learned that Katina Taraganis—a Greek heroine who resisted the enemy during the German occupation, and the leader of the Democratic Greek Women's League—has been sentenced to death by your government in the Piraeus court. In the name of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation and its more than 22 million members, I hereby lodge a strong protest with your government, demanding that you immediately cancel this unreasonable verdict and unconditionally restore her freedom.
    I also want to solemnly tell you: The great victory of the Chinese people's revolution has proven a truth to the world, that is, all reactionaries in various countries who serve foreign imperialists and are hostile to their own people, no matter how cruel their means of slaughtering their own people, will eventually be defeated by the power of the people. All the frantic struggles of the imperialists and reactionaries will prove to be futile, and the democratic forces of the people will eventually win the final victory.
    Chairman of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, Cai Chang
    September 26th

　　希反动政府判妇联领袖死刑
  　我全国妇联提强硬抗议要求立即取消无理判决
    【新华社北京二十七日电】中华全国民主妇女联合会主席蔡畅为了民主希腊妇女联盟的领袖卡特林·塔拉甘尼被希腊反动政府判处死刑，于二十六日向曹达利斯发出紧急抗议，电文如下：新华社布拉格分社急转雅典曹达利斯总理：
    从国际民主妇联书记处来电，得知卡特林·塔拉甘尼——德国占领期间希腊的抗敌英雄、民主希腊妇女联盟的领袖——被你的政府在比里犹斯法庭上判决死刑。我为此特以中华全国民主妇女联合会及其二千二百余万会员的名义向你的政府提出强硬抗议，要求你立即取消这个无理判决。并无条件地恢复她的自由。
    我还要严正地告诉你：中国人民革命的伟大胜利业已向全世界证明一个真理，即一切为外国帝国主义者服务而与其本国人民为敌的各国反动派，无论他们用怎样残酷的手段来屠杀其本国人民，他们自己终归要被人民的力量所击败。帝国主义者和反动派的一切疯狂挣扎都将证明是徒劳的，人民的民主力量终将取得最后的胜利。
    中华全国民主妇女联合会主席　蔡畅
