Xin Jian Factory Glass Instruments
　　Heat-Resistant and Unbreakable
　　Absolute Responsibility to Customers
　　[This Municipality News] The quality of glass instruments produced by the public-owned Xin Jian Glass Factory in Beiping has been greatly improved. The heat resistance of beakers and flasks has reached 280 degrees Celsius, and the ground glass joints are guaranteed to be leak-proof. The factory has added 16 technicians and over 30 apprentices. A new large furnace will be ignited before the 20th of this month, which will increase the production by more than 150%, and the quality will continue to improve. When the factory started trial production in May, the heat resistance of the products was only 220 degrees Celsius. Later, the mixing method was gradually improved, and in the experiment at the end of August, beakers were taken out of hot oil at 280 degrees Celsius and placed in cold water at 20 degrees Celsius without breaking. Two beakers were also used to hold oil, one heated to 220 degrees Celsius and the other to 170 degrees Celsius, and then placed in cold water without cracking. The second beaker was taken out and heated to 210 degrees Celsius, and a straight crack appeared. At the same time, they took a famous heat-resistant container from a certain private glass factory, filled it with oil and heated it to 164 degrees Celsius, and it cracked in a cross pattern when placed in cold water.
　　In terms of finished product processing, due to the careful work of the workers, the ground glass joints of various bottles and jars can be guaranteed to be leak-proof, and the technology of making glass tubes has also been improved. Because of this technical guarantee, the factory is manufacturing micro-analysis instruments in large quantities to supply the research needs of various schools and institutions.
　　In terms of business, the factory adopts an absolute responsibility system to ensure that the conditions proposed by customers are met. Two months ago, the Pingjin Railway Bureau wanted to order a test oxygen tube. Because the dimensions were too strict, the factory was afraid that it could not meet the conditions and did not dare to accept the order. The Railway Bureau took it to a private factory, but it could not be used after two attempts, so they came to the factory again. The factory invited the person who used the instrument, understood the purpose of the instrument and the user's intention, before undertaking the work.
　　Recently, Shenyang, Dalian, Zhangjiakou, Shijiazhuang and other places have directly come to the factory to order goods.

　　新建厂玻璃仪器
　  高热不裂
　  对顾客采绝对负责制
    【本市讯】北平市公营新建玻璃厂所产玻璃仪器质量已大大提高，烧杯、烧瓶的耐热度已达摄氏二百八十度，磨口部分保证不漏水。现已增加技工十六人，学徒三十余人。新装大炉于本月二十日前可点火，产量可增加一倍半以上，质量还将继续提高。在五月该厂开工试造时，产品的耐热度，只达二百二十度。以后逐渐改进配料方法，在八月底试验时，将烧杯从二百八十度的热油中拿出，放入二十度的冷水中，已不破裂。又用两个烧杯盛油，一个烧至二百二十度，一个烧至一百七十度，再放入冷水中，未炸。把第二个拿出，又烧到二百一十度时，裂了一个直纹。他们同时拿一个著名的某私营玻璃厂的耐热器皿，装油烧到一百六十四度，放入冷水中，就裂了个十字纹。
    在成品加工方面，由于工人细心工作，各种瓶罐的磨口部分，已可保证不漏水，烧管的技术也提高了。因为有了这种技术上的保证，该厂正大批制造微量分析仪器，以供应各学校机关研究的需要。
    在营业方面，该厂采取绝对负责制，保证完成顾客所提的条件。两个月前，平津路局要订制一件测验氧气管，因为尺寸定的太严，该厂怕不能履行条件，没敢应。路局拿到私营工厂去，两次做了都不能用，又来找该厂。该厂便把使用该项仪器的人请来，了解仪器的用途和使用者的意图后，才承做下来。
    近来沈阳、大连、张家口、石家庄等地，已直接到该厂来订货。
