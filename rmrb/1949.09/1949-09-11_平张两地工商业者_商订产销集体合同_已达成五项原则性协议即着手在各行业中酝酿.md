　　Ping and Zhang Industrial and Commercial Sectors
　  Negotiate Collective Production and Sales Contract
    Five Guiding Principles Agreed Upon and Implementation Being Planned in Various Industries
    [Our Newspaper] The Beijing Industrial Delegation returned to Beijing on the 8th. The delegation's inspection of the economic conditions of Zhangjiakou, Datong, and other places has achieved considerable success in introducing Beijing's industrial production capacity to the vast rural areas and seeking raw material markets. At the same time, they learned about the sales of industrial products and the production of raw materials. After discussions and research with the industrial and commercial sectors of Zhangjiakou, five guiding principles for direct production and sales links were reached, and the organization of collective production and sales contracts was initiated. This will greatly help to plan the exchange of materials in the future and avoid blindness. Therefore, the delegation has basically achieved the task of promoting material exchanges between Beijing and other regions.
    The industry in Chahar, Suiyuan, and northern Yanmen areas is relatively backward, and is still dominated by handicraft industry. Taking Zhangjiakou, the largest city, as an example, there are 2,977 industrial and commercial households in the city, with industry accounting for 991 households, of which only 129 are machine industries. In the total industrial and commercial capital, industry (including small handicrafts) accounts for only 20%, and the machine industry capital accounts for only 33% of the city's industrial capital. In Datong, out of more than 1,400 industrial and commercial households, only 480 are industrial households, of which handicrafts account for about 90%. The people of Chahar Province need daily necessities such as cloth, towels, and socks, but there is not a single weaving factory or knitting factory in the province. People need high-quality and durable soap, but only two or three of the dozen or so soap factories in Zhangjiakou and the several manual soap factories in Datong produce usable products. Most of the flour mills still use stone mills. To improve production, steel plate mills and steel roller mills must be replaced. Beijing can supply and solve these problems. The rich agricultural products, rural by-products, and animal husbandry products of Chahar Province are all needed by Beijing. Therefore, the natural conditions for material exchange between the two places are formed.
    In the silk and satin shops, department stores, grocery stores, and some stalls in Zhangjiakou and Datong, the industrial delegation could see many products from Beijing, but very few were directly wholesaled by the original Beijing factories. They had gone through several layers of transfer. Each time it goes through a hand, the quality will be lower by one level, and the price will be one level higher. Consumers have to pay several times more than the actual value to buy them. This abnormal trade situation reduces the people's purchasing power and greatly affects the sales of industrial products.
    When the industrial delegation exchanged opinions with the Zhangjiakou Chamber of Commerce and the heads of various industries, everyone unanimously proposed the opinion of direct production and sales links and the signing of collective supply and sales contracts, that is: when Zhangjiakou merchants need industrial products from Beijing, they can, according to their needs, propose the specifications, types, quantity, and price of the products, and collectively purchase them from the original factories through the industrial associations or federations of industry and commerce in the two places. Conversely, the raw materials needed by Beijing factories can also be obtained in the same way to overcome the current multi-layer transfer phenomenon in trade. All industrial and commercial households unanimously believe that in order to develop, they must take this path. However, signing a collective supply and sales contract is an initiative and cannot be done by a small number of people in a short time. Because: 1. The representatives participating in the Beijing Industrial Delegation are not comprehensive enough, and only a few industry representatives from Zhangjiakou participated in the negotiations; 2. The current overall economic situation is still abnormal, and stores that want to purchase goods do not have a large amount of capital, and it is difficult for factories that produce products to give them credit for a long time; 3. Both parties still do not have a deep and specific understanding of the production and sales situation, and it is still difficult to grasp reasonable standards; 4. Both parties do not have specific plans, such as how many raw materials Beijing needs and how many industrial products Zhangjiakou needs cannot be counted for a while, and no figures can be provided. The direct contact between production and sales is urgently needed by industrial and commercial households in the two places. For example, the enamel utensils and soaps brought by the delegation this time have directly ordered a batch of goods in Datong and Zhangjiakou. Therefore, during the last meeting, in order to further promote trade between Beijing and Zhangjiakou and the organized exchange of materials, the five guiding principles were finally reached:

    Five Guiding Principles
    (1) Both parties shall cooperate with and support each other, and may at any time make requests to the other party regarding the status of finished products, raw materials, prices, and sales channels. The receiving party (federation of industry and commerce or trade association) shall, based on the principle of mutual benefit, have the obligation to convene all relevant industrial and commercial sectors or individuals to organize discussions and resolve them as much as possible under the existing conditions. (2) Both parties shall adopt the principle of wholesale as the main method. Production areas shall not sell goods to small vendors in the market, and sales areas shall not collect large amounts from the market for retail sale, so as to avoid mutual influence on production and sales, and to unite legitimate industrialists and merchants to fight against improper commercial behavior. (3) Adopt the business principle of long-term contracts and short-term settlement of accounts. The specific methods shall be negotiated by each industry according to different industries and different times. Eliminate the unreasonable operations of the past and maintain reasonable profits for both parties. (4) The price shall be calculated based on the cost, and shall be lower than the wholesale market price according to the actual situation, adopting the method of small profits and quick turnover. Consider long-term accounting to avoid disputes over average profits. Both parties' associations (especially the Trade Guidance Committee and the Federation of Industry and Commerce) shall report each other's operating conditions (such as finished product prices, raw material prices, specifications, sales volume, etc.). (5) The associations shall absorb households to participate voluntarily, and send representatives to formally sign collective supply and sales contracts to promote and develop both parties' businesses. The size of the contract scope does not need to be limited. After the collective contract is implemented, it shall be inspected and exchanged written opinions at an appropriate stage to improve it and gradually expand the scope.
    Now, after the return of the Beijing Industrial Delegation to Beijing, it will start planning in various industries. The Zhangjiakou Federation of Industry and Commerce has also started to organize and promote it. Soon, the Beijing-Zhangjiakou collective supply and sales contract will be realized, and the organized and planned exchange of materials will officially begin.
    The industrial and commercial households in Datong also have the same requirements. When the Beijing Industrial Delegation was in Datong, the two sides also exchanged views on the issue of "collective procurement" and will refer to the experience and steps of signing a collective supply and sales contract between Beijing and Zhangjiakou to conduct direct production and sales links.

　　平张两地工商业者
　  商订产销集体合同
    已达成五项原则性协议即着手在各行业中酝酿
    【本报讯】北平工业参观团已于八日返抵平。参观团此次考察了张家口、大同等地的经济状况，在向广大农村介绍北平工业生产能力，寻找原料市场等方面都有相当成就；同时了解了工业品销售及原料出产的情形，经与张市工商界讨论、研究，达成产销直接联系的五项原则性协议，并着手组织商订产销集体合同，此对今后有计划地交换物资，避免盲目性，将大有助益。因此，参观团已基本达成促进北平与各地物资交流的任务。
    察、绥、雁北等地工业比较落后，目前仍以手工业为主。以最大的城市张家口言，全市工商业二九七七户，工业占九九一户，其中机器工业仅一二九户；在工商业全部资金中，工业（包括小手工业）仅占百分之二十，机器工业资金又仅占全市工业资金的百分之三十三。以大同市言，一千四百多工商业户中，工业只四百八十户，其中手工业约占百分之九十。察省人民需要布匹、手巾、袜子等日用品，但全省没有一家织布厂和针织厂；人民需要质好耐用的肥皂，而张家口十几家肥皂厂、大同的几家手工造胰厂中只有两三家厂子产品比较可用；各面粉厂仍然大部使用石磨，要在生产上提高一步，必须改换钢板磨和钢滚磨；这些，北平都能够供给、解决。而察省丰富的农产品、农村副产品和畜牧产品，均为平市所需。因之构成了两地物资交流的自然条件。
    工业参观团在张家口、大同的绸布店、百货店、杂货店和一些摊子上都可以看到很多北平的出品，但很少是北平原出品的工厂直接批发而来的，中间经过了好几层转手。每经一道手，品质要低一层，价钱要高一成，消费者要出比实际所值高若干成的代价才能购到手，这种不正常的贸易情况，减低了人民的购买力，大大地影响了工业品的销路。
    工业参观团在张家口与张市商会及各行业负责人交换意见时，大家一致提出产销直接联系，订立供销集体合同的意见，也就是：张家口各商户需要北平工业品时，可以根据需要，提出产品的规格、种类、数目、价格，通过两地的工业会或工商联合会向原出品工厂集体采购。反之，北平工厂需要的原料也可用同样办法，以克服目前贸易上存在着的多层转手现象。各工商业户一致认为为了发展，必须走向这条道路。但订供销集体合同是创举，不是短时间少数人所能办到的。因为：一、参加北平工业参观团的代表尚不够全面，而张市参加商谈的也只是少数行业代表；二、目前整个经济情况仍不正常，欲采购货品的商店没有大批资金，出品的工厂又难长时间赊给；三、双方对产销情况了解仍不够深刻具体，尚难掌握合理的标准；四、双方本身尚无具体计划，如北平需要多少原料，张市需要多少工业品一时不能统计，拿不出数字。而产销直接联系则为两地工商业户所迫切需要的，如此次参观团携带样品的搪瓷用具、肥皂等在大同、张家口都直接订出一批货物。因此双方在最后一次会谈时，为了进一步促进平张两地贸易，有组织的交流物资，终于达成了五项原则性的协议：
    五项原则性协议
    （一）双方互相配合，互相支援，可随时向对方提出有关成品、原料、价格、销路等情况的要求，接到要求的对方（工商联合会或同业公会）根据两利原则有义务召集全体有关工商界或个人进行组织讨论，尽可能在现有条件下予以解决。（二）双方均采取批发为主的方针，产地销货不面对市场小贩，销地不大量的向市场零收，避免互相影响产销，并团结正当工商业者与不正当的商业行为作斗争。（三）采取长期合同，短期结帐的营业原则，根据不同行业、不同时间，各行业具体商洽办法，取消过去不合理之经营，保持双方合理利润。（四）价格根据成本计算，按实际情况低于批发市价，采薄利推销的办法，从长期算帐着眼，以避免在平均利润上的争执，双方公会（特别是贸易指导委员会和工商联合会）要互报经营情况（如成品价格、原料价格、规格标准、销路销量等）。（五）通过公会吸收各户自愿参加，统一派出代表正式订立集体供销合同，繁荣与发展双方业务。合同范围之大小不必拘限，集体合同开始实行后至一适当阶段应互相检查，交换书面意见，加以改进，逐渐扩大范围。
    现北平工业参观团返平后，即着手在各行业中酝酿；张市工商联合会亦已着手组织推动。不久，平张集体供销合同可告实现，正式开始有组织有计划的物资交流。
    大同的工商业户也有同样的要求。北平工业参观团在大同时，双方对“集体采购”问题也交换了意见，将参照平张订立集体供销合同的经验和步骤，进行产销直接联系。
