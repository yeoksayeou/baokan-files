　　Hua University Faculty and Students
　  Warmly Celebrate Anniversary
  　Telegram to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu to Pay Respects
    [Report from this newspaper] Hua University held an anniversary celebration in Beiping on the evening of the 9th. More than 3,000 cadres and students from the entire school gathered together. More than 100 alumni who had graduated in the past and were working in Beiping took time out to attend. President Wu Yuzhang and Vice Presidents Fan Wenlan and Cheng Fangwu, Dean of Studies Nie, and directors of various departments sat under the CCP flag and the Hua University flag to preside over the ceremony.
    After 3,000 people sang the Hua University school song in unison, the responsible comrades of various departments spoke one after another. Chairman Nie Zhen, Dean of Studies, explained that commemorating the anniversary requires a good summary of the teaching experience of the past ten years as a guide for future work, in order to cultivate more revolutionary nation-building talents. Afterwards, President Wu Yuzhang spoke. After analyzing the situation and nature of the Chinese revolution, he particularly pointed out the arduousness of the task of building the country in the future. He said that Hua University, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the CCP Central Committee, and the North China Bureau, and with the efforts of all working comrades and students, has cultivated nearly 100,000 revolutionary cadres in the past twelve years. In the future, it will have to work even harder to continue to cultivate a large number of cadres. He encouraged all teachers, students, and staff to carry forward the glorious tradition of the past, work and study hard, and prepare to undertake the new and great tasks of our school. Vice President Fan Wenlan used many vivid historical facts to illustrate the inevitability of the victory of the Chinese revolution and the inevitable failure of the counter-revolution. He hoped that the few intellectuals who harbored fear or illusions about the United States would quickly abandon their illusions, follow Chairman Mao's instructions, and implement a one-sided approach; serving the people wholeheartedly. Vice President Cheng Fangwu also explained that the new task of Hua University under the new situation is to cultivate the most needed cadres for the new democratic construction in the longer term, and to improve the revolutionary work one step further. Comrade Ai Siqi, deputy director of the Fourth Department, explained that the educational experience and teaching methods created by Hua University have become the universally applied guidelines and methods for reforming old intellectuals throughout the country today. He Gan Zhi, director of the Second Department, and He Wushuang, deputy chairman of the Trade Union, also spoke one after another. Qi Jingzhi, the representative of the student union, on behalf of the newly graduated students, expressed that they would definitely obey the needs of the revolution and the arrangements of the organization, and go wherever the revolution needed them, to become good servants of the people.
    Finally, the entire audience unanimously passed telegrams of respect to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and a message of sympathy to Comrade Luo Mai, former vice president of the Northern Shaanxi Public School.
