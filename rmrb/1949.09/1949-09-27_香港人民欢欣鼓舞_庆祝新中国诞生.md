Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 25th: A delayed dispatch from Hong Kong: The people of Hong Kong are welcoming the opening of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference with excitement. The three newspapers, *Wah Sheung*, *Ta Kung Pao*, and *Wen Wei Po*, published news of the grand opening ceremony of the CPPCC and documents such as Chairman Mao's opening address on the 22nd with huge headlines. All three newspapers published editorials on the same day, warmly celebrating this founding ceremony of the People's Republic of China. The atmosphere of excitement permeated the entire city, and people scrambled to read the news and documents of the CPPCC opening. The sales of the three newspapers increased greatly.

　　*Wah Sheung Daily*, in its editorial entitled "Welcoming the New Upsurge of Victory – Celebrating the Founding Ceremony of the People's Republic of China," stated: "The great Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference is an important milestone in the transformation of modern Chinese history from a semi-colonial and semi-feudal state to an independent, democratic, peaceful, unified, and prosperous new China." The editorial further stated: "A historically unprecedented unified situation is about to emerge throughout the country, and this unified situation will inevitably bring about a new upsurge in the revolutionary armed forces of China, a new upsurge in the great unity of the Chinese people, and a new upsurge in close unity with countries in the international anti-imperialist united front. The Chinese nation will break through all difficulties and obstacles, finally win the victory of national construction, and work together with the people of the world to realize lasting world peace." *Ta Kung Pao*'s editorial stated: "The political foundation of the People's Republic of China is composed of the broad masses of the people in a four-class alliance led by the worker-peasant alliance, which will shine with unique brilliance in the world."
