　　Loving one's country, being loyal to one's people, hoping that one's people enjoy freedom, and doing everything possible to make the people free and happy is the supreme duty of every honest person and the responsibility of every young citizen. In order to prevent young people from actively participating in the struggle for national independence, reactionaries propagate the abominable ideas of cosmopolitanism and betrayal of the country and people. In order to divert the youth's attention and prevent them from paying attention to the struggle for their rights, and at the same time to prevent the youth from striving to improve their living standards and gain youth rights through struggle, the heads of reactionary youth and anti-democratic youth organizations supported by Anglo-American reactionaries promote the idea that war is the savior that eliminates all evils, incite war mania, and recruit young people into the army. The youth must be with their people, rise up to defend the most advanced culture, defend the progressive arts and literature of their own nation, and fight with all their might against the spiritual enslavement of American imperialism.
    The Alliance, in its ranks, gathers millions of progressive youth, fighting for lasting peace, democracy, national independence, and a bright future for youth. There is no doubt that the Alliance will also victoriously fulfill its noble mission.

    Suggestions for the World Federation of Democratic Youth's Work

    The Soviet delegation proposes to fully approve the activities of the Executive Committee of the World Federation of Democratic Youth in organizing the struggle for the unity of the international democratic youth movement. The Soviet delegation fully supports the provisions contained in the reports and speeches, namely, the struggle for lasting peace and friendship among nations, against all manifestations of aggression, and against the threat of new wars, must be the focus of attention of all youth organizations affiliated with the World Federation of Democratic Youth. In our opinion, the Executive Committee of the World Federation of Democratic Youth and all organizations affiliated with the Federation must cooperate closely with all organizations fighting for peace, especially with the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress.
    The Soviet delegation proposes to approve the resolutions of the World Peace Congress and urge youth organizations in various countries to participate most actively in the implementation of these resolutions, to participate most actively in the establishment of national, city, township, and other peace committees, and to participate in their work.
    The Soviet delegation proposes to adopt the suggestion to designate October 2nd as International Peace Day.
    The Soviet delegation believes that the Congress should fully support the struggle of the democratic youth of India, Vietnam, Burma, Malaya, and other colonial and dependent countries, and should support the youth of Republican Spain and democratic Greece, who are fighting for national freedom and independence. The World Federation of Democratic Youth must constantly assist the democratic youth of these countries in its daily work.
    The Soviet delegation believes that the Congress should call on the youth of the world to protest against the persecution of democratic youth organizations and democratic youth leaders by the United States, India, Spain, Greece, South Korea, Latin American and Near Eastern countries. Persecution for opposing the incitement of new wars and national hatred is not permissible. Reactionaries must not be allowed to take the law into their own hands, nor should they be allowed to engage in anti-people activities.

    The World Federation of Democratic Youth must, regardless of religious belief, race, or property, jointly follow the policy of uniting forces and strengthening the solidarity of democratic youth. The Congress must reaffirm the necessity of further implementing the policy of uniting forces and strengthening the solidarity of democratic youth, call on progressive youth organizations to cooperate with the Democratic Youth Federation, and call on them to join the ranks of the Federation.

    The Soviet delegation fully supports the suggestions made by several representatives to condemn the divisive and destructive activities of the reactionary leaders of the International Union of Socialist Youth, Catholic youth organizations, and the leaders of the so-called "World Youth Conference" interim committee who attempt to weaken the strength of democratic youth.

    Soviet Youth Will Fully Support the World Federation of Democratic Youth

    The four years since the establishment of the Federation have been four years of growth in democratic forces and solidarity among democratic youth ranks, and four years of upsurge in the progressive youth movement. Today, the World Federation of Democratic Youth can frankly say that it has not disappointed the hopes of millions of progressive youth. It is worth pointing out that the growth of new leading cadres in democratic organizations is also a characteristic of these years. Today, we see tens of thousands of activists dedicating their energy to the cause of democracy and providing sublime service to the ideals of progressive humanity.
    The Second Congress proactively illustrates the achievements won by the World Federation of Democratic Youth. Today, in the fraternal family of democratic youth, we see the young soldiers of heroic China, the representatives of progressive youth in Korea, the young anti-fascist fighters of the Free German Youth League, and three and a half million democratic youth in Japan. On the basis of fighting for peace and opposing war, the World Federation of Democratic Youth has successfully organized a broad united front of democratic youth.

    The Soviet delegation assures the Congress that Soviet youth will contribute all its strength to strengthening the solidarity of the democratic youth movement, and will actively cooperate with the Federation, and fully support its work in fighting for peace, democracy, national independence, and a bright future for youth.

　　为和平民主民族独立与青年的美好将来而斗争
    ——苏联代表团团长米哈依洛夫九月四日在第二次世界青年代表大会上的演说摘要（续完）
    热爱自己的国家，忠于自己的人民，希望自己的人民享有自由，并竭尽一切使人民自由幸福，这是每一诚实的人的至高无上的职责，是每一个年青公民的职责。反动分子们为了不让青年积极参加争取民族独立的斗争，就宣传世界主义和背叛国家与人民的可憎的思想。为了转移青年的视线，使他们不注意争取其权利的斗争，同时为了不让青年努力经由斗争来改善生活水平和获得青年权利，英美反动派所支持的反动青年和反民主青年组织的头子们，就宣传战争是消除一切罪恶的救星，煽动战争狂，并招募青年当兵。青年必须与其本国人民在一起，奋起保卫最先进的文化，必须起而保卫自己民族的进步的艺术和文学，并以全副力量为反对美帝国主义的精神奴役而斗争。
    联盟在其队伍中，聚集了千百万进步青年，为争取持久和平、民主、民族独立，为争取青年美好的将来而斗争。无疑的，联盟将同样胜利地履行其崇高的任务。
    对世界青联工作的建议
    苏联代表团建议，完全批准世界民主青联执委会在组织争取国际民主青年运动统一的斗争中的活动。苏联代表团充分拥护在报告和发言中所包含的规定，即争取持久和平与各民族友好、反对一切侵略的表现、反对新战争威胁的斗争，必须作为世界民主青联所属一切青年团体的注意的中心。按我们的意见，世界民主青联执委会及青联所属的一切团体，必须与一切为和平而斗争的团体、特别是与世界拥护和平大会常设委员会密切合作。
    苏联代表团提议批准世界拥护和平大会的决议，促请各国的青年团体最积极的参加履行这一决议，最积极地参加全国、城、乡和其他和平委员会的建立，并参加它们的工作。
    苏联代表团提议通过订十月二日为国际和平日的建议。
    苏联代表团认为，大会应充分支持印度、越南、缅甸、马来亚及其他殖民地附属国的民主青年的斗争，应支持共和西班牙与民主希腊的青年，他们正为民族的自由与独立而斗争。世界民主青联在其日常工作中必须经常不断地援助这些国家的民主青年。
    苏联代表团认为，大会应号召全世界青年抗议美国、印度、西班牙、希腊、南朝鲜、拉丁美洲和近东各国迫害民主青年组织和民主青年领袖的行为。因人民反对煽动新战争和民族仇恨而加以迫害的行为是不能容许的。不能让反动派把法律掌握在他们自己的手里，不能容许他们进行反人民的勾当。
    世界民主青年联盟必须不分宗教信仰，种族或财产，共同遵循团聚力量、加强民主青年团结的方针。大会必须确认进一步执行团聚力量、加强民主青年的团结这一方针的必要性，号召进步的青年组织和民主青联合作，并号召它们参加青联的队伍。
    苏联代表团完全拥护若干代表所提出的建议，即声斥国际青年社会主义者联盟、天主教青年组织的反动领袖、和所谓“世界青年会议”临时委员会的领袖企图削弱民主青年力量的分裂破坏活动。
    苏联青年将全力支持世界青联
    联盟开始工作以来的四年，是民主力量增长和团结民主青年队伍的四年，是进步青年运动高涨的四年。今天，世界民主青年联盟可以坦然地说，它并没有辜负千百万进步青年的希望。值得指出的是，民主组织新的领导干部的成长也是这几年来的特点。今天我们看到成万成十万的积极分子正把他们的精力贡献给民主的事业并为进步人类的理想作崇高的服务。
    第二届代表大会主动地说明着世界民主青年联盟所赢得的成就。今天我们在兄弟般的民主青年的家庭中，看到有英雄中国的青年战士、朝鲜进步青年的代表、自由德国青年联盟的青年反法西斯志士、和三百五十万日本民主青年。在争取和平反对战争的基础上，世界民主青年联盟已成功地组织了民主青年的广泛统一战线。
    苏联代表团向大会保证，苏联青年将把它的全部力量贡献给加强民主青年运动团结的事业，并将积极地和联盟合作，全力支持其为和平、民主、民族独立、与青年美好将来而斗争的工作。（按此文摘译自塔斯社五日电，题目和小标题系编者所加）
