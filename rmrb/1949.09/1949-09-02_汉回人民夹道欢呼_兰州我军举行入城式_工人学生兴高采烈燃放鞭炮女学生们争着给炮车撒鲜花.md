　　Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 1st. On the fifth day after the liberation of Lanzhou City on the 30th of last month, the People's Liberation Army held a grand entry ceremony. Early in the morning, workers, students and citizens, holding small red and green flags, ran to Dongguanwai to line up to welcome them. At 8:30 a.m., when the advance troops participating in the entry ceremony entered through the Dongchao Gate, warm applause and non-stop cheers immediately rang out from the welcoming crowd. Following the infantry were various artillery pieces, motorized infantry, anti-aircraft artillery teams, and tank teams. The most eye-catching and exciting of these were the 18-horse-drawn 15-sheng howitzers and tank units, which were captured by a certain corps of the People's Liberation Army in the Taiyuan Campaign and played a powerful role in the Lanzhou siege. Workers and students happily set off firecrackers, and the cannons were plastered with slogans such as "Long Live the People's Liberation Army!" and "Advance to Xining!". The female students competed to sprinkle bouquets of flowers on the gun carriages. At about 10 o'clock, the entering troops passed through the most bustling street in front of the Gansu Provincial Government. Tens of thousands of Han and Hui citizens cheered on both sides of the street. Propaganda trucks and parades advanced simultaneously, and military music was played in unison, making the situation particularly enthusiastic. During the city-wide celebration of the People's Liberation Army, two bandit planes flew over to harass, and the anti-aircraft artillery in the marching ranks of the People's Liberation Army opened fire on the spot, and the enemy planes fled in panic. After the enemy planes fled, the troops continued to advance, passing through the main streets of the city, leaving the city through the West Gate, and the entry ceremony ended victoriously at about 11 o'clock.

　　汉回人民夹道欢呼
  　兰州我军举行入城式
  　工人学生兴高采烈燃放鞭炮女学生们争着给炮车撒鲜花
    【新华社兰州一日电】上月三十日兰州市解放后之第五日，解放军举行隆重的入城式。清晨，工人、学生和市民就手拿红绿小旗，跑到东关外列队欢迎。上午八时半，当参加入城式的先头部队从东朝门开入时，立即在欢迎的人群中响起热烈的掌声和不息的欢呼。随步兵前进的是各种大炮、摩托化步兵、高射炮队及坦克队，其中最引人注目与最使人兴奋的是十八匹马拉的十五生的榴弹炮和坦克部队，这是解放军某兵团在太原战役中缴获的，在这次兰州攻坚战中，曾发挥了强大的威力。工人、学生们高兴地燃放着鞭炮，在大炮上贴满了“人民解放军万岁！”“打到西宁去！”等标语。女学生们更争把一束一束鲜花撒到炮车上。十时许，入城部队通过最热闹的甘肃省政府门前的大街，成千上万的汉回市民们夹道欢呼，宣传卡车和游行队伍同时并进，军乐齐鸣，情况尤为热烈。在全市欢迎解放军的狂欢中，曾有两架匪机飞临上空骚扰，解放军队伍里行进中的高射炮就地开火，敌机乃仓惶逃走。敌机逃走后部队继续前进，通过了市内各主要街道，由西门出城，至十一时许入城式胜利结束。
