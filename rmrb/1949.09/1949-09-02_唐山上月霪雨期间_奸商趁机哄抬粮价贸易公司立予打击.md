Tangshan Electric Dispatch: Since August, Tangshan City has experienced continuous rain, coupled with several typhoons, resulting in reduced autumn harvests in rural areas. Citizens and farmers in disaster areas, fearing grain shortages, rushed to purchase coarse grains, creating an opportunity for unscrupulous merchants to manipulate the market. On August 15th, the market price of corn suddenly rose from 136 yuan per *jin* to 143 yuan; sorghum rose from 110 yuan to 123 yuan, showing a trend of sudden increases. At that time, the Douhe River in the suburbs overflowed, and the market was flooded. Although the Oil and Grain Department of the Trade Company temporarily set up seven additional sales outlets, it failed to prevent unscrupulous merchants from raising prices due to insufficient publicity. On August 18th, the Trade Company organized its forces to sell miscellaneous grains on the market and purchase autumn wheat to solve the food difficulties of the disaster victims and stabilize prices. The public's mood gradually stabilized; some private merchants still believed that the company could not sell large quantities regularly and adopted a wait-and-see attitude. However, by the 21st, the company's grain prices remained unchanged, and the purchase quantity was not restricted. As a result, private merchants dared not continue to hoard, and a large amount of miscellaneous grain entered the market. On the 22nd and 23rd, private merchants' grain prices were already lower than the company's listed prices. By the 24th, new grain was seen on the market. On the 25th, the company took the initiative to lower grain prices, such as millet, whose company price fell from 130 yuan per *jin* to 125 yuan; rice fell from 270 yuan to 235 yuan, and corn fell from 110 yuan to 97 yuan. The public's desire to buy grain gradually softened, and private merchants were also eager to sell miscellaneous grains, so market prices began to stabilize. In total, from August 9th to 23rd, the Trade Company sold more than 2 million *jin* of miscellaneous grains and purchased 445,500 *jin* of autumn wheat,打击打击打击奸商的操纵.

　　唐山上月霪雨期间
  　奸商趁机哄抬粮价贸易公司立予打击
    【唐山电】八月以来，唐山市连续霪雨，再加台风数次侵袭，农村秋收减产，市民及灾区农民防备粮荒，争购粗粮，造成奸商乘机操纵的空隙。八月十五日市场玉米每斤由一百三十六元突涨到一百四十三元；红粮由一百一十元涨到一百二十三元，形成突涨的趋势。当时市郊陡河泛滥，市场被淹，贸易公司油粮部虽临时增设了七处代售店，但由于宣传不够，仍未能制止奸商哄抬物价。十八日贸易公司组织力量，上市抛售杂粮，收购秋麦，解决灾民食粮困难，平抑物价。群众心情渐稳；个别私商当时仍认为公司不可能经常大量出售，表示观望。但至二十一日，公司粮价始终未变，购买数量亦未加限制，私商因此不敢继续囤积，大批杂粮上市。二十二、二十三两日私商粮价已低于公司牌价，至二十四日已见新粮上市，二十五日公司又主动地下压粮价，如小米公司牌价由每斤一三零元降至一二五元；大米由二七零元降至二三五元，玉米由一一零元降至九七元，群众购粮心气渐软，私商亦急于抛售杂粮，市场物价于是开始平稳。总计自八月九日至二十三日，贸易公司共售出杂粮二百多万斤，购进秋麦四十四万五千五百斤，打击了奸商的操纵。
