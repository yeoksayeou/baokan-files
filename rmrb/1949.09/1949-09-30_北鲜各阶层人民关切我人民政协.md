　　北鲜各阶层人民关切我人民政协
    【新华社平壤二十八日电】北朝鲜各阶层人民以极大注意和欢欣鼓舞的心情，关切着中国人民政治协商会议第一届全体会议的召开。本社记者在平壤所接触的朝鲜各界人士，几乎没有一个人不以政协开会的情形相询。朝鲜劳动党中央机关报“劳动新闻”和朝鲜中央政府机关报“民主朝鲜”，连日均以巨大篇幅刊载政协开幕及会议进展的消息。二十五日两报同时发表毛主席开幕词全文。“劳动新闻”并以“中国人民政治协商会议的伟大意义”为题撰述专文说：中国人民政治协商会议是使中国人民变成主人的会议，是表现中国人民大团结的会议，是标志今后将取得更大胜利的会议。中国这一伟大的事件，对于世界的和平与安全以及对东方被压迫民族为独立解放的斗争，有着莫大的贡献。
