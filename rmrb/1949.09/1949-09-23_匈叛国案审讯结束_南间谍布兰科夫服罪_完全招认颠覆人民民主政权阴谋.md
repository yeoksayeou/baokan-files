　　(Report from our correspondent in Budapest) Hungarian People's Court completed the trial of the treasonous criminals on the 19th after examining the four criminals including András Szalai. Witnesses of the treasonous case were examined on the 20th, and the debate began.
　　(Xinhua News Agency, Budapest) After examining Bárfé on the 17th, the Hungarian People's Court interrogated Rasal Brankov, the head of the Yugoslavian intelligence agency in Hungary and the Yugoslavian chargé d'affaires to Hungary. When asked by the chief magistrate if he pleaded guilty, Brankov said: He pleaded guilty to the main accusations, but not to all of them.
　　According to Brankov's confession, he came to Hungary in 1945 as an official of the Yugoslavian military mission affiliated with the Allied Control Commission for Hungary. In 1947, he was appointed head of the mission, later as a counselor of the Yugoslavian Embassy in Hungary, and finally as the Yugoslavian chargé d'affaires. Brankov said that from July 1947 to September 1948, he officially served in the Yugoslavian State Security Administration. His superiors were General Milic and Minister of the Interior Rankovic.
　　The chief magistrate asked: Can you list one by one the Yugoslavs who were engaged in espionage in Hungary?
　　The defendant replied: Those who have been engaged in espionage in Hungary since 1945 include: Colonel Zicimir, the head of the Yugoslavian military mission affiliated with the Allied Control Commission for Hungary, Major Jaworski, Major Kovac, Mrazovic, the Yugoslavian Ambassador to Budapest, Major Smirjanic, the head of the consulate, Counselor Jovanovic, Commercial Counselor Dr. Gavrilovic and his assistants Gasinovic, Jubic and others.
　　The defendant confessed that this group immediately began espionage activities in the country upon their arrival in Hungary, and worked according to the firm orders of Tito and Rankovic. Zicimir, the head of the Southern military mission to Hungary, was summoned by Tito before the mission left for Hungary, and Tito gave instructions in the presence of Djilas and Rankovic. Tito said: The situation in Hungary is not stable at present, and it is necessary to investigate the situation in the country, establish close contacts with the British and American representatives belonging to the Allied Control Commission; and resolutely resist the expansion of Soviet influence on the mission members.
　　Brankov said that the responsibilities of the members of the mission to Hungary were assigned as follows: Zicimir, the head of the mission, who had contacts with the Americans during the war, was engaged in maintaining direct contact with the British and American representatives of the Allied Control Commission. Janorski, the main person in charge of the State Security Administration in Hungary, was responsible for organizing espionage activities in Hungary and among the Soviet troops. He also had to organize a spy network in Hungary.
　　Kovac was entirely engaged in anti-Soviet military espionage activities. He was considered an expert in this regard because he had been engaged in these activities while working in the Yugoslavian General Staff.
　　Brankov claimed: I was appointed to do work on the economic front.
　　When the defendant Brankov answered the chief magistrate's question about what methods the Yugoslavian intelligence agency used, he confessed: The intelligence agency used all kinds of methods that conformed to Machiavellian principles. Rankovic gave a firm direction in this regard, declaring before the delegation went to Hungary: To achieve the goal, any and all methods must be used. We recruited personnel by means of threats, forcibly abducted Hungarians from Hungary, and took them to Yugoslavia, etc.
　　The defendant Brankov confessed that one day, a Hungarian citizen, Jubica Sibal, was tricked into the Yugoslavian consulate in Hungary. He was detained there and taken to Belgrade in a diplomatic vehicle with forged documents. He was forced to sign an oath to work for the Yugoslavian intelligence agency by means of various threats and promises. The defendant claimed: Similar violations of international practice by Yugoslavian diplomatic officials have occurred repeatedly. When Rankovic learned that Anton Rob, a member of the Hungarian Parliament, was facing the threat of arrest for carrying out espionage activities for the benefit of Yugoslavia, he took steps to rescue Rob and bring him to Yugoslavia. According to Rankovic's instructions and with the knowledge of Mrazovic, the Yugoslavian Ambassador to Hungary, Rob was secretly smuggled into Yugoslavia in a diplomatic vehicle.

　　Tricking Hungarian People into Serving as Spies, Supplying Intelligence to the US and Britain

　　In answering the chief magistrate's question about which Hungarian citizens were employed as Yugoslavian spies, Brankov confessed: There was no particular difficulty in recruiting spies, because they often had nationalist and pro-fascist elements to rely on. He said: Zicimir and I often met with Rajk as early as 1945. We knew what he believed in, and we also knew that he disliked Rakosi, Farkas, and Gerő, and he was eager to rule everything. We talked openly about everything with him. Thus, although he was not yet a formal agent, he carried out all our instructions. Subsequently, Rankovic formally employed him. It was not difficult to employ Bárfé either. Obviously, he was a nationalist, and he greatly admired Tito's policies. He gladly supplied me with all the necessary materials, including state secrets and information about the Hungarian armed forces. Colonel Lozic, the Southern military attaché to Hungary, formally employed him.
　　Szalai was recruited by Major Smilinich, the head of the Yugoslavian consulate in Hungary. For this purpose, the latter used all the intelligence of the Yugoslavian intelligence agency, that is, about seventy Yugoslavian and Hungarian communists were sentenced to death in the "Sayolalia-Ujoli" prison in 1944 because of Szalai's betrayal.
　　The chief magistrate asked: Does this mean that Tito and his representatives used those whose hands were still dripping with the blood of Southern Communist Party members?
　　Szalai replied: Yes.
　　Justus, Ognenovic, Horvath, Zvevej, Selesnis and others were also recruited by the Yugoslavian intelligence agency in the same situation.
　　The chief magistrate asked about the situation of recruiting Anton Rob, and Brankov replied: Rob was recruited by Jaworsbi-Keith in 1945. Rob had his own independent spy network, and he had direct relations with Rankovic.
　　The chief magistrate asked: Is recruiting fascist intelligence agents your specialty?
　　The defendant replied: Rankovic told us that this was irrelevant. The only thing that matters is a well-organized spy network.
　　Brankov confessed: The Yugoslavian intelligence agency tried to establish a wide-ranging spy network in Hungary, and this spy network can be said to have gradually penetrated all departments of state institutions, the military, the police, and so on. He said that from this spy network we obtained the most diverse types of political, economic, and military intelligence. Brankov also particularly confessed that the Yugoslavian intelligence agency received information from Rajk about the measures that the Hungarian State Security Agency was going to take against the British and American intelligence agencies. Due to the instructions of Rankovic and Kadar, this information was passed on to the representatives of the British and American missions.
　　During the war, Tito, Rankovic and Kadar's people established contact with the intelligence agencies of the US and Britain not only in Yugoslavia but also abroad. The defendant said that he discovered these connections during a conversation with Zicimir and from the secret archives of the State Security Administration. While the war was still going on, Lomba was sent to Switzerland with the task of establishing contact with Allen Dulles, the head of the American intelligence organization in Europe. Lomba also established contact with the Trotsky group there in Switzerland.
　　Ratinovic in Marseille and Jovanovic in Bari (in Italy) established close contact with the intelligence agencies of the US and Britain. In London, there was General Velebit - an old British spy. He handed over all his intelligence, including intelligence about the Soviet army, to the British intelligence agency. As Brankov confessed, he also learned about these things from the secret archives of the State Security Administration.
　　Now, Colonel Zicimir is the Yugoslavian Ambassador to London, Ratinovic is the Yugoslavian Ambassador to Switzerland, and Lomba is an official of the Yugoslavian Embassy in Bucharest. Regarding Velebit, after the liberation of Yugoslavia, he served as the First Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs. Jovanovic was a counselor of the Yugoslavian Embassy in Budapest and has been sent out of the country by the Hungarian authorities. The defendant requested the court to allow him to describe Jovanovic's character in detail later.
　　According to Zicimir, contact with the intelligence agencies of the US and Britain in Hungary was temporarily interrupted. After the publication of the famous Cominform resolution, Rankovic again ordered to restore contact with the British and American intelligence agencies in Hungary. Brankov said that he was in Belgrade at the time and had discussed with Djilas. Djilas told him about Tito's talks with the British and Americans, who said that if Tito agreed to stand with them against the Soviet Union, they would be willing to give Yugoslavia military and political assistance. In addition, Djilas strongly argued that the Yugoslavian government must accept this suggestion, because the British and Americans are the natural allies of Tito's Yugoslavia. In order to ensure the contact between the Yugoslavian and British and American intelligence agencies, Rankovic specially sent Chebesic and Sivinovic to Hungary for this purpose. Contact was established with British Vice-Consul Bittite, representative of the three occupation zones, Matti, and American Lieutenant Colonel Kopga. Speaking of the relationship between the Yugoslavian rulers and the Yugoslavian people, the defendant confessed that Tito had long been separated from the people and had sold their interests to British and American imperialism. Brankov believed that the rebellious actions of Tito, Kadar, Djilas and Rankovic had been obvious as early as when the Great War was in full swing. In the end of 1943 and the beginning of 1944, they allowed British and American representatives to appear in the Yugoslavian high command. The chief magistrate asked Brankov if he could name the British and American representatives, and Brankov said that the list was sent to all the general staffs in the country, and it was ordered that they be remembered so as to help these people when necessary. Brankov listed in detail the names of the British and American representatives who were in Yugoslavia at the time. In the command headquarters there were the American mission (including Colonel Huntington and Lieutenant Colonel Felts) and the British mission (including General Maclean, Lieutenant Colonel Moore and Sherbin, and Major Churchill); on Vis Island (in the Adriatic Sea) there were American Major Urban and British Major Covet; the Macedonian command headquarters had British Major Guiney and Lieutenant McDonald; the Serbian command headquarters had American Captain Grimm and British Major Hanik and Major Ark; the Croatian command headquarters had American Captain Ryder and British Major Rogers; the Slovenian command headquarters had American Major Goodwin and British Major Warns; the Vojvodina command headquarters had British Major Lavison and Lieutenant Wood, among others. The defendant confessed that, according to secret intelligence in the State Security Administration archives, these people were all veteran agents of the British and American intelligence agencies. They pursued such a goal: to place the Yugoslavian leaders and the Yugoslavian people, along with its neighboring countries, under the influence of the US and Britain. The defendant said that, as far as he knew, they had been able to influence Tito, Djilas, Kadar and Rankovic. Brankov described three typical events that exposed the relationship between the Tito group and the US and Britain. In 1944, Tito's command headquarters was trapped in an encirclement. Only because Soviet pilots transported Tito and his staff to the port of Bari, regardless of the artillery fire, were Tito and his staff rescued from the encirclement. Randolph Churchill and Maclean had offered to help Tito use British warships, hoping to form a closer relationship with Tito. Rankovic, Kadar and Djilas all advocated that Tito accept the proposal. But the Soviet command prevented this from happening.

　　Most of the Important Officials of the Tito Group Were Employed by the US and Britain

　　Churchill was eager to occupy the Adriatic coast of Yugoslavia, although this was absolutely unnecessary, because the coast had already been liberated by the guerrillas. Tito agreed to the occupation of the coast, meaning that Yugoslavia must be occupied by Britain at all costs, and Yugoslavia must be friendly to them. However, the Soviet command also prevented the realization of this plan.
　　As the war drew to a close, the question of the liberation of Belgrade and Serbia arose. The Yugoslavian army could not complete this task on its own. The Americans and British did not want Tito to ask for Soviet help. Although the Soviet army had reached the Yugoslavian border, Tito was hesitant and only reluctantly requested Soviet help to liberate Serbia and Belgrade because of necessity. These three facts show what the British and American representatives in Tito's command were trying to achieve and what Tito's own position was.
　　Brankov confessed: From his conversations with Zicimir and from the secret materials in the State Security Administration archives, he was deeply convinced that the Americans and British had employed first of all Djilas, Kadar and Rankovic as their agents. In addition, there were also the Prime Minister of a certain Yugoslavian republic, Marko Belinich, the current Prime Minister of the Serbian government, Stambolic, Corlo Mrazovic, the Prime Minister of Slovenia, Miha Marinko, the member of the Yugoslavian government, Svetozar Vukmanovic, the Minister of Industry, the Chairman of the Yugoslavian Supreme Economic Council, Kidlich, and so on.
　　Brankov confessed: As a result of the pro-American and pro-British tendencies of the Yugoslavian leadership during the war, serious differences developed within the Yugoslavian Communist Party and the Yugoslavian army. Ujovic and Hebrand did not approve of this tendency. They had many supporters. In order to eliminate them, Rankovic sent them to the most dangerous war zones.
　　The chief magistrate asked: Tell us about Tito's plans for the post-war period.
　　The defendant replied: The Yugoslavian rulers believed that Yugoslavia was of great strategic importance and that it must play a decisive role in the Balkans and Central Europe. The essence of Tito's plan was to establish a large federation in the form of a bourgeois democratic republic containing the Balkan and Central European countries under his rule. This federation should be inclined to the West.
　　This plan was born in 1945, but it was carefully kept secret. Only a very small number of people—Tito, Rankovic, Djilas and Kadar—knew about this plan.
　　Brankov believed that Tito and his cronies were carrying out the plans of the American imperialists. Brankov said that the Tito group wanted to describe this policy as something "new" in Marxism, and that Tito himself was a person who was "enriching" Marxism. The main purpose of Tito's agents in Hungary was to conduct propaganda for Tito and win the Hungarian people over to their side. The scope of activity of the Yugoslavian agents was not limited to Hungary. They extended their tentacles to other democratic countries. In Romania, they sought hope in the Minister of Justice, Patrascanu, who did not object to the implementation of Tito's plan, but was promptly removed and separated from the party. Rankovic complained to Brankov that everything in Romania must now start from scratch. For these purposes, Lomba was later sent to Romania.
　　Great hope was also placed on the discord within the Polish Workers' Party. They thought that Gomulka might become someone who could realize Tito's conspiracy. However, Gomulka exposed the incorrectness of Tito's line. Answering the chief magistrate's question, Brankov confessed: During the Kelibia talks, Rajk had received specific instructions on how Tito's plan should be implemented, and insisted that Rakosi, Farkas and Gerő must be killed. Recalling the content of this meeting (the defendant attended as a translator), Brankov said: Rankovic asked Rajk to organize an opposition within the Hungarian Communist Party and that Rajk would receive significant help from the Yugoslavian government in case of difficulties.

　　匈叛国案审讯结束
  　南间谍布兰科夫服罪
    完全招认颠覆人民民主政权阴谋
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：塔斯社布达佩斯消息，匈牙利人民法庭对叛国罪犯审讯已于十九日审讯安德拉斯·萨莱等四犯后，已告结束，二十日审问叛国案证人，并开始辩论。
    【新华社讯】塔斯社布达佩斯讯：匈人民法庭十七日审毕巴尔费后，即提审南斯拉夫在匈牙利的谍报机关的头目南斯拉夫驻匈代办拉萨尔·布兰科夫。布兰科夫在答复首席推事所询他是否服罪时，他说：他对主要的控告服罪，但并非对所有的控告服罪。
    据布兰科夫供认，他于一九四五年，以盟国对匈管制委员会的所属南斯拉夫军事使团的官员身份来到匈牙利。一九四七年他被委为该使团团长，后来为南斯拉夫驻匈公使馆参事，最后任南斯拉夫代办。布兰科夫说，从一九四七年七月开始到一九四八年九月，他一直正式服务于南斯拉夫国家保安处。他的最高上司是米利奇将军和内政部长兰科维奇。
    首席推事问：你能逐一举出在匈牙利从事谍报工作的南斯拉夫人吗？
    被告答：自一九四五年以来即在匈牙利从事间谍活动的有：附属于盟国对匈管制委员会的南斯拉夫军事使团团长兹齐米尔上校，雅沃斯基少校，科瓦奇少校，南斯拉夫驻布达佩斯公使姆拉佐维奇，领事馆负责人斯米尔雅尼奇少校，参事尤凡诺维奇，商务参赞加夫里洛维奇博士及其助理加西诺维奇、尤比奇和其他等人。
    被告供称：这一集团系在他们一到达匈牙利时就立即在该国开始间谍活动，并按照铁托和兰科维奇的坚决命令工作。南驻匈军事使团团长兹齐米尔于该使团离国赴匈牙利之前，曾被铁托召见，铁托当着德热拉斯和兰维科奇之面给予指令。铁托说：目前匈牙利的局势尚未稳定，需要调查该国局势，与属于盟国管制委员会的英美代表建立密切的联系；并坚决对抗苏联对使团团员影响的扩张。
    布兰科夫说驻匈使团团员的职责，分配如下：战时即与美国人有联系的使团团长兹齐米尔，从事与盟国管制委员会的英美代表保持直接联系。为国家保安处驻匈牙利的主要人员的加诺尔斯基，其职责在于组织在匈牙利和苏军中间的间谍活动。他也要在匈牙利组织间谍网。
    完全从事反苏军间谍活动的是科瓦奇，他被认为是这方面的专家，因为他在南斯拉夫参谋部工作时即从事于这些工作。
    布兰科夫称：我是受任做关于经济方面的工作的。
    被告布兰科夫当答复首席推事所询关于南斯拉夫谍报机关利用怎样办法这一问题时，他供称：谍报机关利用各种各样符合于马奇亚维里底原则的方法。兰科维奇在此方面给予坚决的方针，于代表团赴匈前宣称：为了达到目的，要利用任何一切的方法。我们借威胁的手段招雇人员，从匈牙利强拐匈牙利人，并将他们带至南斯拉夫去等等。
    被告布兰拉夫供称：有一天，匈牙利公民尤彼卡·希巴尔被骗诱到匈牙利的南斯拉夫领事馆中，他被拘留在那里，并被以伪造文件由外交专车解往贝尔格莱德。用各种各样的威胁和诺言，强使他签署了要为南斯拉夫谍报机关工作的誓书。被告称：南斯拉夫外交官员之同样的违反国际惯例的情事，屡有发生。当兰科维奇获悉匈议会一议员安东·罗勃因为南斯拉夫利益进行间谍活动而面临被捕的威胁时，便采取了营救罗勃到南斯拉夫去的步骤。按照兰科维奇的训令并在南驻匈公使姆拉佐维奇知晓的情况下，罗勃被用外交专车秘密偷运到南斯拉夫。
    胁骗匈人民充当间谍以所获情报供给美英
    在回答首席推事所询被告能够举出匈牙利公民中谁被雇用为南斯拉夫间谍这一问题时，布兰科夫供称：招雇间谍并没有什么特别困难，因为他们经常有民族主义、亲法西斯的分子作倚靠。他说：我和兹齐米尔远在一九四五年就常常会见拉伊克。我们知道他所确信的，而且也知道他不喜欢拉科西、法卡斯和格罗，他亟欲统治一切。我们曾与他公开地谈论一切问题。这样，虽然他还不是正式的代理人，但他却履行了我们的一切指示。随后，兰科维奇正式雇用了他。雇用巴尔费也不是困难的。显然的，他是民族主义者，他非常佩服铁托的政策。他欣然地供给我一切必需的材料，包括国家机密的和有关匈牙利武装部队的情报。南驻匈武官洛齐奇上校正式雇用了他。
    萨莱被南斯拉夫驻匈牙利领事馆的头子斯米林奇少校所招雇。为了这个目的，后者利用了南斯拉夫谍报机关所有的情报，即大约七十个南斯拉夫与匈牙利的共产党员均因萨莱的告密而于一九四四年在“萨约拉利亚——乌约利”监狱被处死刑。
    首席推事问：这就是说铁托和他的代表们利用那些手上仍然滴着南共党人鲜血的人们？
    萨莱回答说：是的。
    尤斯图斯、奥格涅诺维区、贺尔瓦特、兹别维伊、谢列兹尼斯与其他人等，也在同样的情形下被南斯拉夫谍报机关所招雇了。
    首席推事问及被告所知道的关于招雇安东·罗勃的情形，布兰科夫回答说：罗勃是在一九四五年为雅沃尔斯比·凯特所招雇的。罗勃有他自己独立的间谍网，他和兰科维奇直接发生关系。
    首席推事问：你以招雇法西斯情报员为你的专业吗？
    被告回答说：兰科维奇告诉我们说这是无关系的。唯一有关系的事就是一个组织良好的间谍网。
    布兰科夫供称：南斯拉夫间谍机关设法在匈牙利建立广布的间谍网，这间谍网可以说已逐渐钻进了国家机构、军队、警察等等的一切部门中。他说从这个间谍网我们得到了种类最繁多的有关政治、经济、和军事性质的情报。布兰科夫特别还供称：南斯拉夫谍报机关由拉伊克处收到了关于匈牙利国家保安机关对英美谍报机关所要采取的措施。由于兰科维奇与卡德尔的训令，此项情报被传给了英美使团的代表。
    战争期间，铁托、兰科维奇及卡德尔的人们不仅在南斯拉夫，而且还在国外与美英的谍报机关建立了联系。被告说，我在与兹齐米尔谈话时以及从国家保安处的秘密档案中发现了这些联系。战争仍在进行时，洛姆巴即负着与美国在欧洲的谍报组织的负责人艾伦·杜勒斯建立联系的任务被派至瑞士，洛姆巴到了瑞士还与那里的托洛斯基集团建立了联系。
    在马赛的拉蒂诺维奇与在巴利（在意大利）的尤凡诺维奇，曾与英美的谍报机关建立了密切联系。在伦敦，有维利比特将军——英国的老间谍。他把他所有的一切情报，包括关于苏军的情报在内，都交给了英国的谍报机关。象布兰科夫所供认的，这些事情他也是从国家保安处的秘密档案中知道的。
    现在，兹齐米尔上校任南斯拉夫驻伦敦大使，拉蒂诺维奇是南斯拉夫驻瑞士公使，洛姆巴是南斯拉夫驻布加勒斯特公使馆一官员。关于维利比特，南斯拉夫解放后，他曾任外交部第一副部长。尤凡诺维奇曾是南斯拉夫驻布达佩斯公使馆的参事，且已为匈牙利当局送出国境。被告要求法庭允许他以后再特别详述尤凡诺维奇的人品。
    据兹齐米尔称，与英美在匈牙利的谍报机关的联系曾临时间断。在著名的情报局决议发表后，兰科维奇再度训令与英美在匈牙利谍报机关恢复联系。布兰科夫说，当时他在贝尔格莱德，曾与德热拉斯会商。德热拉斯把铁托与英人和美人的谈话告诉了他，英人美人说，若铁托同意与他们站在一起反对苏联，他们愿意给南斯拉夫以军事和政治的援助。此外，德热拉斯曾力言南斯拉夫政府必须接受这一建议，因为英美是铁托南斯拉夫的天然的同盟。为了保证南斯拉夫与英美谍报机关间的联系，兰科维奇曾特别为了这一目的，派捷贝西奇与西魏诺维奇到匈牙利。与英国副领事比提特、三占领区代表马梯及美国的寇普加克中校建立起联系。说到南斯拉夫的统治者和南斯拉夫人民的关系时，被告供称，铁托早已脱离了人民，并且把他们的利益出卖给英美帝国主义。布兰科夫认为：铁托、卡德尔、德热拉斯和兰科维奇的叛逆行动，早在大战正酣时就已经明显了，在一九四三年底与一九四四年初时，他们便容许英美代表出现于南斯拉夫高级统帅部里。首席推事问布兰科夫能否举出英美代表的名字，布兰科夫说，名单发到全国所有的参谋部里，并且下令要他们记住，以便在必要时帮助这些人。布兰科夫详细列举出当时是在南斯拉夫方面的英美代表的姓名。在司令部里有美国使团（包括亨廷顿上校与费尔茨中校）与英国使团（包括麦克利安将军，摩尔与谢尔宾中校和邱吉尔少校）；在维斯岛（在亚德里亚海中）有美国的乌尔班少校和英国的柯维特少校；马奇顿司令部有英国圭尼少校与麦唐纳中尉；塞尔维亚司令部有美国格里姆上尉与英国汉尼克少校和阿尔克少校；在克罗特司令部有美国莱德上尉和英国罗杰尔斯少校；在斯洛文尼亚司令部有美国古温少校与英国沃恩斯少校；沃耶沃丁司令部有英国拉维逊少校，和伍德中尉等人。被告供称，根据国家保安处档案中的秘密情报，这些人都是英美谍报机关老练的代理人。他们追求这么一个目的，要使南斯拉夫领袖以及南斯拉夫人民和它的邻国同这些领袖一起处于美英的影响之下。被告说，就所知而言，他们已能使铁托、德热拉斯、卡德尔与兰科维奇受美英的影响。布兰科夫描述了三桩暴露铁托集团和美英间关系的典型事件。一九四四年，铁托司令部陷于重围中，只是因为苏联飞行员不顾炮火将铁托及其参谋人员航运到巴利港，铁托及其参谋人员才被从包围中拯救了出来。伦道夫·邱吉尔和麦克利安曾献殷勤地建议铁托利用英国战舰，期望着从而形成与铁托的更紧密的联系。兰科维奇、卡德尔和德热拉斯都主张铁托接受这个提议。可是苏联的司令部防止了此事的发生。
    铁托集团重要官员大部为美英所雇用
    邱吉尔亟欲占领南斯拉夫的亚德里亚海岸，虽然这已经绝对不需要了，因为海岸业已为游击队解放。铁托同意海岸的占领，意即南斯拉夫无论如何务须由英国占领，而且南斯拉夫必须与他们友善，然而，在这件事上苏联司令部也防止了这个计划的实现。
    战争临近结束时，解放贝尔格莱德和塞尔维亚的问题发生了。南斯拉夫军靠自己的力量不能完成这件工作，美国人和英国人不愿铁托请求苏联帮助。尽管苏军已兵临南斯拉夫边境，但铁托仍犹豫不决，而且只是由于必要才迫不得已请求苏军帮助解放塞尔维亚和贝尔格莱德。这三桩事实表明在铁托统率部的英美代表曾力求达成些什么以及铁托本人的立场如何了。
    布兰科夫供称：从与兹齐米尔的谈话和从国家保安处档案的秘密材料看来，他深信：美国人和英国人已雇用了首先是德热拉斯、卡德尔及兰科维奇为他们的代理人，此外，尚有南斯拉夫某加盟共和国的总理马尔科·别里尼区，塞尔维亚政府现任总理斯坦鲍利奇，科尔洛·姆拉佐维奇，斯洛文尼亚总理米哈·马林科，南斯拉夫政府阁员什维托萨·伏克曼维奇，工业部长、南斯拉夫最高经济委员会主席基德利奇等等。
    布兰科夫供称：战时由于南斯拉夫领导机构的亲美与亲英的倾向的结果，南斯拉夫共产党内及南斯拉夫军队中就有严重的分歧发展起来了。尤约维奇及海布朗不赞同这一倾向，他们有许多支持者，为了排除他们，兰科维奇便把他们派到最危险的战争地带去。
    首席推事问：告诉我们铁托战后期间的计划。
    被告回答说：南斯拉夫统治者认为南斯拉夫具有非常的战略重要性，它必须在巴尔干与中欧起决定性的作用。铁托计划的本质在于：在他的统治下建立包含巴尔干及中欧各国的、资产阶级民主共和国形式的大联邦。这一联邦要倾向西方。
    这一计划在一九四五年便已诞生了，不过被谨慎地保守着秘密。只有特别少数的人——铁托，兰科维奇，德热拉斯与卡德尔才知道此项计划。
    布兰科夫认为铁托及其党羽执行了美国帝国主义者的计划。布兰科夫说铁托集团想把这一方针说成为马克思主义中某种“新”的东西，而铁托本人则为“丰富着”马克思主义的人。在匈牙利的铁托代理人的主要目的是为铁托进行宣传并把匈牙利人民争取到他们一方去，南斯拉夫代理人的活动范围不限于匈牙利，他们向其他民主国家伸出了他们的触角。在罗马尼亚，便向司法部长巴特拉斯卡努寻找希望，他不反对实现铁托的计划，但被及时地撤换掉并被使与党隔离开来。兰科维奇向布兰科夫抱怨说：现在在罗马尼亚一切均须再从头开始，为了这些目的，洛姆巴后来便被派到了罗马尼亚。
    对波兰工人党内的不和也寄予了巨大的希望，他们以为哥穆尔卡可能成为能够实现铁托阴谋的人，然而哥穆尔卡揭穿了铁托路线的不正确性。回答首席推事的问题时，布兰科夫供认：在凯利比亚会谈时，拉伊克已接到关于铁托计划应如何付诸实现的具体训令，且坚持必须杀死拉科西、法卡斯与格罗。回忆这次会谈（被告曾以翻译的身份出席）的内容时，布兰科夫说：兰科维奇要求拉伊克在匈牙利共产党内组织反对派并且如遇困难时拉伊克将得到南斯拉夫政府方面的重大帮助。
