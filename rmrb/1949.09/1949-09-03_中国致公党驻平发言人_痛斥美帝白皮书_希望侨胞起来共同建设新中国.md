　　Spokesperson of the China Zhi Gong Party stationed in Beiping
  　Denounces the US Imperialist White Paper
  　Hopes Overseas Chinese will rise up to jointly build the New China
    [This newspaper's dispatch] The spokesperson of the China Zhi Gong Party stationed in Beiping gave his opinion on the US imperialist White Paper, as follows:
    The US State Department published the so-called White Paper on Sino-American relations on August 5th of this year. This is the confession of US imperialism colluding with the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique to invade China, and it is also a declaration of war against the Chinese people. It shamelessly boasts of the traditional US policy toward China, such as the "Open Door Policy" and "equal opportunity." These slogans are undoubtedly due to the fact that the rise of US imperialism lagged behind other countries. After the end of the Second World War, as a result of the expansion of US imperialist forces, it wanted to monopolize the world and comprehensively control China, so it desperately supported the reactionary regime of Chiang Kai-shek as its puppet. In three or four years, it spared no expense in providing the Kuomintang with a large amount of US dollars, ammunition, and materials, totaling more than four billion, and successively sent special envoys, special envoys, ambassadors, and military delegations to China to carry out reactionary conspiracies in order to support the Chiang regime in carrying out anti-people war. This is clearly admitted in the reports of Hurley and others quoted in the White Paper. We can say that without the ferocity of US imperialism, Chiang Kai-shek would never have been so cruel, and the Chinese people would not have suffered such a miserable fate.
    Now, the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique has finally been defeated by the heroic People's Liberation Army, and a new people's democratic regime in China is about to be established. The arrogant US imperialism cannot but admit that the Chiang regime has been abandoned by the people and that its aid has been ineffective. However, it completely pushes the responsibility onto the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique.
    We know that the policy of US imperialism will never repent due to failure, and it will carry out aggression even more insidiously. This is the nature of imperialism. The White Paper and the recent trends of US imperialism frankly reveal this. Seeing that the Chiang regime has collapsed, it hopes that "democratic individualists" will "encourage China to develop into an independent and stable country by all feasible means, and be able to assume the tasks that a great and free nation should shoulder in world affairs." Obviously, it appreciates "democratic individualists" because it wants to alienate China's revolutionary united front and establish a puppet regime that serves US imperialism.
    At present, there may be a small number of people in the country who do not clearly understand US imperialism and the line between the people and the anti-people, and still remain on the sidelines. But they have a patriotic conscience and will never be willing to be accomplices of US imperialism. Even if there are a very few bad elements who are used by US imperialism and are willing to cut themselves off from the people, the powerful people's forces will surely be able to eliminate them.
    The US imperialist White Paper frankly admits that it cannot easily abandon China. In addition to pinning its hopes on the emergence of a so-called puppet regime of "democratic individualists," it also wants to lead other imperialists and their vassals to organize a so-called anti-communist front, and carry out the so-called Pacific Pact in Asia, hoping to attack the democratic regime of the Chinese people.
    The people's democratic regime in China was created by the Chinese people through arduous struggle. This kind of regime is the people's democratic dictatorship that Mr. Mao Zedong spoke of, that is, a democratic regime led by the working class, based on the worker-peasant alliance, and uniting the petty bourgeoisie and the national bourgeoisie. This regime has the support of the broad masses of the people and has sufficient strength to completely overthrow imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. This regime is a regime that loves democracy and upholds peace, and it will inevitably unite with the Soviet Union and other countries in the world that love democracy and uphold peace on the same front to fulfill our responsibility to defend world peace. Here, I would like to add that US imperialism claims to "oppose China's establishment of any regime that serves foreign interests." We should point out that this kind of regime is the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary regime that is about to be eliminated, which is loyal and sincere in serving the US imperialists.
    Here, we should mention the overseas Chinese. In the high tide of the anti-imperialist revolution in the motherland, overseas Chinese are living in areas controlled by imperialism, and their situation is very difficult. We are very concerned. But our overseas Chinese should know that only by establishing a unified, progressive, prosperous and strong motherland can we protect the legitimate interests of overseas Chinese. We believe that the power of the people is enough to defeat the imperialist policy of aggression and any reactionary remnants at home. We hope that overseas Chinese will unite and take consistent steps with the people at home to jointly complete the mission of building a new democratic New China.

### 中国致公党驻平发言人　痛斥美帝白皮书　希望侨胞起来共同建设新中国

　　中国致公党驻平发言人
  　痛斥美帝白皮书
  　希望侨胞起来共同建设新中国
    【本报讯】中国致公党驻平发言人为美帝白皮书发表意见，文如下：
    美国国务院本年八月五日发表所谓中美关系的白皮书。这是美帝勾结蒋介石反动集团侵略中国的供状，也是对中国人民的宣战书。它厚颜地夸耀美国对华传统政策，如“门户开放主义”，如“机会均等”。这些口号，无疑是因为美帝国主义者的发迹比其他国家落后一步的原故。第二次世界大战结束以后，由于美帝国主义势力扩张的结果，要垄断世界，要全面控制中国，便拼命的扶植蒋介石的反动政权做它的傀儡，三四年间，不惜以大量的美元、军火、物资援助国民党，总数在四十亿以上，并先后派遣专使、特使、大使和军事代表团来华执行反动的阴谋，以支持蒋政权从事反人民的战争。这，在白皮书内引用的赫尔利诸人的报告，供认得明明白白。我们可以说，没有美帝的凶狠，蒋贼决没有如此的残毒，中国人民也没有这样惨苦的遭遇。
    现在，蒋介石的反动集团，终于被英勇的人民解放军击败了，中国新的人民民主政权行将成立，骄横的美帝，也不能不承认蒋政权被人民厌弃了，它的援助无效了。可是，它把责任完全推到蒋介石的反动集团身上。
    我们知道，美帝的政策，绝不会因失败而悔改的，它还要更险狠的进行侵略。这是帝国主义者的本质。白皮书和最近美帝的动态坦白的表现出来。它眼见蒋政权垮了，就希望“民主个人主义者”“以一切可行的方法，鼓励中国发展为独立和安定的国家，能在世界问题上担负一个伟大而自由的民族所宜担负的任务”。显然的，它赏识“民主个人主义者”，是想离间中国的革命统一战线，建立起一个为美帝国主义而效力的傀儡政权。
    现时国内或有少数分子，对于美帝国主义，和人民与反人民的阵线认识不清，犹存观望。但他们是具有爱国天良的，必不肯做美帝的帮凶。纵令有极少数的不良分子，受美帝利用，甘自绝于人民，而强大的人民力量，亦必能消灭他们。
    美帝白皮书，坦白承认不能轻易放弃中国，它除了寄幻想于所谓“民主个人主义者”的傀儡政权的出现外，还要领导其他帝国主义者及其附庸组织所谓反共阵线，在亚洲即进行所谓太平洋公约，希图打击中国人民的民主政权。
    中国的人民民主政权，是中国人民于艰苦奋斗中创造出来的。这种政权，就是毛泽东先生说的人民民主专政，就是以工人阶级领导，工农联盟为基础，团结小资产阶级和民族资产阶级，共同组织的民主政权。这个政权，有广大的人民支持，有足够的力量彻底打倒帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义。这个政权，是爱好民主拥护和平的政权，必然的和世界上爱好民主拥护和平的苏联和其他国家，联合在一条战线上，尽我们保卫世界和平的责任。这里附带一句，美帝声言“反对中国建立起任何服役于外国利益的政权”，我们应该指出，这种政权，就是快要消灭的蒋介石反动政权，它竭忠尽诚的服役于美帝国主义者。
    这里，我们应该提到海外侨胞。在祖国进行反帝革命的高潮中，侨胞生处于帝国主义控制区内，处境是很困难的。我们十分关怀。但我们侨胞应该知道，只有建立统一进步富强的祖国，才能够保障侨胞的正当利益。我们相信人民的力量足以击溃帝国主义的侵略政策和国内任何反动残余。我们希望海外侨胞一致起来，和国内人民采取一致的步骤，共同完成建设新民主主义新中国的使命。
