　　Reading "New Heroes and Heroines"
    After the author sent me the clippings of "New Heroes and Heroines," I read it through. Although I read it intermittently and it took me a few days, I was always attracted to it, as if I had read it all in one go.

    This is indeed a successful work, which can compete with the old "Heroes and Heroines," and even with "Water Margin" and "Romance of the Three Kingdoms" for mass readers.

    The progressive figures in it are all ordinary sons and daughters, but they are also collective heroes. It is their ordinary qualities that make us feel close to them, and it is their heroic spirit that makes us feel respect for them. This invisibly educates the readers, making them realize the most genuine face of the Communist Party members. Readers can get great encouragement from this to transform themselves or promote themselves. Can't men all be like Niu Dashui? Can't women all be like Yang Xiaomei? Don't be afraid of being ordinary, backward, or even illiterate and ignorant, as long as you are conscious, seek progress, have a spirit of self-sacrifice, and faithfully practice Chairman Mao's thought, anyone can become a pillar of the new society.

    Since the War of Resistance Against Japan, these respectable and lovable figures and moving deeds have been everywhere in the liberated areas. If we more extensively record and describe them, and then synthesize and organize them, just in terms of quantity, wouldn't it be many times greater than works like "Water Margin"? People have long been complaining that "China has no great works," but such works are indeed being produced.

    We should thank Chairman Mao's instructions at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art, which gave the literary and art circles a grand torch, illuminating the future of creation. Under this illumination, the writers in the liberated areas have already had many successful works. The author of this book also faithfully followed Chairman Mao's instructions and achieved success. The characterization of the characters and the narration of the events are very solid and natural, and the use of the language of the people is also very skilled. I hope they will continue to work hard and achieve greater success. At the same time, I am also very willing to recommend it, hoping that most friends can read this book. If possible, I also hope that painters will make more illustrations, so that it can be widely circulated like the illustrated novels of the past.

    Let me tell you one more honest thing: when this book is published, I would like to read it again once or twice.

### 读了“新儿女英雄传”

　　读了“新儿女英雄传”
    承作者把“新儿女英雄传”的剪报送给我，我读了一遍。读的时候虽然是断续的，费了几天工夫，但始终被吸引着，就好象一气读完了的一样。
    这的确是一部成功的作品，大可以和旧的“儿女英雄传”，甚至和“水浒传”、“三国志”之类争取大众的读者了。
    这里面进步的人物都是平凡的儿女，但也都是集体的英雄。是他们的平凡品质使我们感觉亲热，是他们的英雄气概使我们感觉崇敬。这无形之间教育了读者，使读者认识到共产党员的最真率的面目。读者从这儿可以得到很大的鼓励，来改造自己或推进自己。男的难道都不能做到牛大水那样吗？女的难道都不能做到杨小梅那样吗？不怕你平凡、落后、甚至是文盲无知，只要你有自觉，求进步，有自我牺牲的精神，忠实地实践毛主席的思想，谁也可以成为新社会的柱石。
    从抗日战争以来，这些可敬可爱的人物，可歌可泣的事实，在解放区里面是到处都有的。假使我们更广泛地把它们纪录描写出来，再加以综合组织，单从量上来说，不就会比“水浒传”那样的作品还要伟大得不知多少倍吗？人们久在埋怨“中国没有伟大的作品”，但这样的作品的确是在产生着了。
    应该多谢毛主席在延安文艺座谈会上的指示，给予了文艺界一把宏大的火把，照明了创作的前途。在这一照明之下，解放区的作家们已经有了不少的成功作品。本书的作者也是忠实于毛主席的指示而获得了成功的。人物的刻划，事件的叙述，都很踏实自然，而运用人民大众的语言也非常纯熟。我希望他们再向前努力，获得更大的成功。同时我也很愿意负责推荐，希望多数的朋友能读这一部书。假使可能的话，更希望画家们多作插画，象以前的绣像小说那样以广流传。
    让我再说一句老实话吧：等这书出了版时，我愿意再读它一两遍。
