　　Starting with the Transformation of Trade Associations
  　Strengthening Production Guidance in Various Industries
  　The Industry and Commerce Bureau is Selecting Key Industries for Implementation; The Soap Making and Cigarette Trade Associations are Undergoing Transformation
    [This Municipality News] The Industry and Commerce Bureau of the Beiping Municipal People's Government is strengthening production guidance for various industries, starting with the transformation of trade associations. Currently, it is focusing on the soap making and cigarette industries, gradually carrying out this work.
    The current problems in the soap making (including alkali production) industry in this municipality are the large number of businesses, poor technology, low quality, and few sales channels. This industry has gradually increased since liberation, once developing to about 600 businesses in April of this year. Later, due to product expansion and inability to sell, it gradually decreased, and has now been reduced to more than 320 businesses. The total output of each factory in July was 12,075 boxes of soap, 168,512 jin of alkali water, 41,940 jin of alkali blocks, and 2,100 jin of scented soap. Adding the stock from the past few months, the total amount of accumulated soap and alkali is very large. Moreover, soap produced by factories in Tianjin still occupies a considerable amount of the Beiping market. Therefore, some small-scale soap making businesses in Beiping have not reported closure recently, but have in fact temporarily stopped production. In addition, only six soap making businesses in the city use electricity. Most other manufacturers have backward technology, poor quality, and high costs. There are also phenomena such as cutting corners, reducing materials, adulterating, and counterfeiting, which affect the development of the industry. In order to enable them to organize themselves, improve technology, improve quality, and solve production and sales difficulties, the Industry and Commerce Bureau began to transform the trade association of the industry last month. Twenty-one member groups were compiled by district, and group leaders were selected separately. Recently, a joint meeting of the group leaders was held to elect preparatory committee members for the trade association. In the future, the new trade association will lead the industry to improve production.
    The crux of the current problems in the cigarette industry is the backwardness of manual production technology. Among the more than 800 cigarette businesses (taxpayers) in the city, only 13 use electric power for manufacturing (currently there are 14 machines). Two or three hundred particularly small-scale family cigarette businesses have specialized in making counterfeit cigarettes for generations, selling them at lower prices, which hinders the development of legitimate production. The old trade association had only 18 members, of which 13 were mechanized and five were manual. Sixty-two newly joined manual manufacturers have been divided into eight groups under the leadership of the Industry and Commerce Bureau, and held a joint meeting of group leaders on August 15th to establish a preparatory committee for the new trade association of the industry. The official trade association can be established in mid-September. In promoting this work, the Industry and Commerce Bureau, combined with their production problems, conducted preliminary education. Some are prepared to unite several companies to replenish funds and change from manual to mechanized production. Some are trying to add funds to refit hand-cranked machines. Others, who have difficulty with funds and have low technology and cannot continue to maintain production, have stopped production and are preparing to change careers.

　　从改造同业公会着手
  　加强各业生产指导
  　工商局正选定重点进行造胰卷烟公会正改造中
    【本市讯】北平市人民政府工商局从改造同业公会着手，加强对各行业的生产指导，现正以造胰、卷烟两业为重点，逐步进行。
    本市造胰（包括制碱）业目前存在的问题是户数多，技术劣，品质低，销路少。该业自解放后逐渐增多，今年四月份曾一度发展至六百户左右，后以产品膨胀不能销售，又渐减少，至目前已减到三百二十余户。七月份各厂总产量，肥皂一万二千零七十五箱，碱水十六万八千五百一十二斤，碱块四万一千九百四十斤，香皂二千一百斤，加上过去几个月的陈货，整个胰碱积存数量很大。且天津各厂出产的肥皂在北平市场还占有相当数量，因此，北平最近有一部分规模小的造胰业虽未呈报歇业，但事实上已暂时停工。另外全市造胰业仅有六家使用电力，其他多数厂家都技术落后，质量差，成本高。并且有偷工、减料、掺假、冒牌等现象，影响该业发展。工商局为了使他们自己组织起来，改进技术，提高质量，解决产销困难，乃于上月开始着手改造该业同业公会工作。以区为单位，分编了廿一个会员小组，分别选出组长，最近即由各小组长开联席会，选举同业公会筹备委员，以后即由新的同业公会领导该业改进生产。
    卷烟业目前问题的症结，是手工生产技术落后，全市八百多家（纳税户）卷烟业，仅有十三家用电力制造（现共有十四台机子），有特别规模小的二三百家家庭卷烟，两三代以来专做冒牌假烟，以较低价格出售，对于正当生产的发展是一种阻碍。该业旧公会仅有十八个会员，其中十三户是机制，五户是手工，新加入六十二户手工制造的，他们已在工商局领导下分成八个小组，于八月十五日举行过小组长联席会，成立了该业新同业公会的筹委会，正式公会九月中就可成立。工商局在推进这一工作中，结合着他们的生产问题，进行了初步教育，有些已准备联合数家充实资金，由手工改为机制，也有几家设法增添资金改装手摇机，另有资金困难且技术低劣不能继续维持者已经停工，准备转业。
