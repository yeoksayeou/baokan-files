　　Northeast Bank Loans Nearly Four Trillion in First Half of Year

[Shenyang News] The Northeast Bank issued loans totaling over 3.8 trillion Northeast currency in the first half of this year. Loan recipients were primarily urban industries, while also considering agriculture. State-owned enterprises accounted for 72.8 percent of the loans, agricultural loans accounted for 21.4 percent, cooperatives accounted for 3.1 percent, and private enterprises accounted for 2.7 percent. Loans to state-owned enterprises were mostly used to restore factories and mines. This spring, agricultural loans helped 600,189 peasant households solve their difficulties in obtaining means of subsistence. Specialty crop loans solved the problems of cotton seeds in twenty counties, silkworm seeds in sixteen counties, and pesticides and fertilizers for fruit trees in five counties. Fishery loans enabled fishermen in nine coastal counties and cities to repair boats and mend nets so they could go to sea for fishing on time. Loans to private enterprises were mainly given to industries beneficial to the national economy and people's livelihoods. For example, the Harbin Farm Implement Factory received a loan of 300 million yuan to create a weeder, and the Yutai Iron Factory received a loan of 200 million yuan to manufacture a gas engine to replace electricity.
