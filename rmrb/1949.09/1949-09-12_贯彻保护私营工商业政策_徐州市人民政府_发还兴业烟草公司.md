　　Implementing the Policy of Protecting Private Industrial and Commercial Businesses
　  Xuzhou Municipal People's Government
　  Returns Xingye Tobacco Company
    [Xuzhou News] The Xingye Tobacco Company, originally managed by the Xuzhou Municipal People's Government on behalf of the owner who had fled, has been verified as private capital. On August 26th, the handover plan was signed by representatives of the People's Government and representatives of the capital side, and the official return was completed on September 3rd. The company was originally the Dongya Tobacco Company built by the Japanese invaders. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, it was taken over by the Kuomintang and sold to the company's manager, Mi Shengwu. The factory has 15 cigarette-making machines, 6 tobacco-cutting machines, 2 knife-grinding machines, and 1 each of drying, cold-drying, flavoring, and hardening machines. In addition, there are 2 lathes, 1 planer, 1 drilling machine, 1 water pump, 2 boilers, 157 factory buildings, and 21 acres of land. During the rule of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, due to the dumping of commodities by imperialists, the market was flooded with American goods, and bureaucratic capital manipulated the monopoly, the factory could only operate 4 cigarette-making machines, barely supporting itself with 270 employees. Last December, when Xuzhou was nearing liberation, the factory's leaders did not understand our Party's policy of protecting industry and commerce and developing production, so they fled to Shanghai. Moreover, there were no archives to be found in the factory, the nature of the capital was ambiguous, and the situation of the shareholders was unknown. In order to develop production and take care of the workers' lives, the People's Government took over and started production. At the beginning of the trusteeship, only a few of the factory's buildings were barely habitable; most of the remaining 150-odd buildings were dilapidated. It took more than three months to roughly repair them. In addition to their work, the workers also overhauled cigarette-making machines Nos. 1 and 2, as well as four previously unusable machines (only four of the original fifteen were usable). They also repaired the collapsed boiler flue and built warehouses, giving the factory a completely new look. The workers gained the status of masters in politics and participated in the management of the factory. In May of this year, in response to the call of the People's Government to launch a production merit campaign, all the workers in the factory, led by union members, Youth League members, and production activists, enthusiastically produced. Each cigarette-making machine produced 1,712 packs of cigarettes per day, an increase of 50 percent compared to pre-liberation levels, and the products gained a good reputation in the market.
    After the liberation of Shanghai, the person in charge of the company personally experienced the People's Government's policy of protecting industry and commerce. Manager Mi Shengwu and factory director Zhang Huiyuan returned to Xuzhou and requested the People's Government to return the factory. After a detailed investigation by the Municipal People's Government, it was determined that the factory was indeed private capital, and it was decided to return it at the end of July. This decision caused various concerns among the workers, who feared that the capitalists would reduce staff, prevent them from learning, and reduce wages. After nearly a month of explanation and education by the factory cadres, the workers' emotions were stabilized. On August 22nd, the Municipal People's Government and the Xingye Company manager began consultations. At the beginning of the negotiation, the capital side was still doubtful, believing that the government would not sincerely return the factory, and even if it did, they feared that there would be excessively high conditions, and even proposed selling the factory to the government. After repeated explanations by the government representatives, the concerns of the capital side were finally allayed. After four discussions, the handover plan was signed on August 26th. The handover took place that day. The handover plan stipulated:
    (1) Xingye Company shall be responsible for the house donation paid by Xuzhou Tobacco Factory before the handover; (2) During the trusteeship period, the foundation of the newly built warehouse of Shandong Company originally belonged to Xingye Company, and both parties now agree that Shandong Company shall purchase it at a price; (3) Shandong Company shall compensate for the decoration paper and cash used from Xingye Tobacco Factory during the trusteeship period by paying in wheat; the payment shall be made after the accounts have been settled; (4) The double year-end salary and allowance grain issued by Shandong Company in December of the 37th year under orders shall be the responsibility of Xingye Company; (5) For the repairs and installations during the trusteeship period that Shandong Company cannot take away, Xingye Company shall purchase them at a price, and all original materials shall be returned to Xingye Company.

　　贯彻保护私营工商业政策
　  徐州市人民政府
　  发还兴业烟草公司
    【徐州讯】因原主逃亡由徐州人民政府代管之兴业烟草公司，经查明确系私人资本，已于八月二十六日由人民政府代表与资方代表签订交接方案，并于九月三日正式发还完毕。该公司原系日寇所建筑之东亚烟草公司。抗日战争胜利后，为国民党接收，卖与该公司经理宓绳武。厂内有卷烟机十五部，切烟机六部，磨刀机两部，干燥、干冷、加香压硬等机各一部，另有旋床二部，刨床、钻床各一部，水泵一个，锅炉两部，厂房一百五十七间，地基二十一亩。蒋匪统治时期，由于帝国主义商品倾销，美货充斥市场，官僚资本操纵垄断，致使该厂当时仅能开动卷烟机四部，用二百七十名职工勉强支持。去年十二月，徐州临近解放时，因该厂主持人不了解我党保护工商业发展生产政策，遂逃往上海，且厂中无档案可查，资本性质模糊，股东情况不明。人民政府为了发展生产、照顾工人生活，即予接管开工生产。代管之初，厂内之房屋只有几间可以勉强住用，其余一百五十余间，大部破漏。用了三个多月的时间，始大致修好。工人们在工作之余，并大修了一、二号卷烟机，及以前不能用的机器四部（原十五部仅四部能用），还修理了已经倒塌的锅炉风道，建筑了仓房，使厂内面目焕然一新。工人们在政治上获得了主人翁的地位，参加了工厂的管理工作，今年五月，为响应人民政府号召，开展生产立功运动，全厂工人在工会会员、青年团员、生产积极分子的带头率领下，热情生产，每部卷烟机每日产烟一千七百十二条，较解放前增产百分之五十，产品在市场获得良好信誉。
    上海解放以后，该公司负责人亲身体会到人民政府保护工商业的政策，经理宓绳武及厂长张惠元等即返回徐州，要求人民政府发还该厂，经过市人民政府详细调查后，认为该厂确系私人资本，即决定于七月底发还。这一决定，曾引起工人的种种顾虑，他们怕资本家减人，不让学习，减低工资。经过该厂干部近一月的解释、教育，始安定了工人的情绪。八月二十二日，市人民政府和兴业公司经理开始进行磋商。商谈之初，资方还有疑惑，认为政府不会诚意发还，发还亦怕有过高条件，曾提出把厂子卖给政府。经过政府代表再三解释，资方顾虑终告减除。在四次商讨以后，于八月二十六日在交接方案上签字。当日进行交接。交接方案中规定：
    （一）交接前徐州烟厂所交纳的房捐应由兴业公司负责；（二）在代管期间山东公司新建之仓库地基原属兴业公司，现双方同意由山东公司出价收购；（三）山东公司在代管时动用兴业烟厂之装璜纸、现金等作价，以小麦折实发还，款在结清帐目后即行付给；（四）三十七年十二月份山东公司奉命加发之年关双薪及津贴粮概由兴业公司负责；（五）代管期间之修缮、设置，凡山东公司所不能带走者，由兴业公司出价收购，原有一切物资一概发还兴业公司。
