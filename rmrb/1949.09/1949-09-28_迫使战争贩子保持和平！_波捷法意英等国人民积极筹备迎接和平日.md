　　[Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 27th] The great movement of European people to defend peace continues to surge. According to the Polish News Agency, millions of Polish workers and peasants have expressed their determination to defend peace and have taken action. The Polish Committee for the Defense of Peace has been universally established in industrial organizations and villages throughout the country. The Committee for the Defense of Peace issued the following slogans for the International Day of Struggle for Peace on October 2nd: "Millions of simple people defend peace, the force of peace is greater than the force of the warmongers," "Worldwide action forces the warmongers to maintain peace," "Long live the invincible fortress of peace - the Soviet Union," "Spies, traitors, subversives, and the imperialist lackeys - Titoists are aiding war," etc. The Polish Women's Federation issued a letter to women nationwide for the International Day of Struggle for Peace and will organize a national conference of women labor champions on the 25th.
　　Working masses in all parts of Czechoslovakia have decided to hold grand peace rallies from September 25th to October 2nd.
　　Italy is actively preparing for the International Day of Struggle for Peace on October 2nd. Major youth groups and organizations such as the Former Guerrilla Fighters League have responded to the call of the Italian Peace Committee to participate in the International Peace Day demonstrations and will organize mass rallies and "peace bonfires" in various places.
　　The French Committee of the World Peace Congress announced that the central peace rally will be held in the Palais des Expositions at the Porte de Versailles in Paris. Representatives of various French organizations unanimously decided to participate in the peace vote. Although the Renault automobile factory management has sanctioned workers willing to vote for peace, 29,747 of the 30,000 organized metalworkers in Paris still voted in favor of peace. Odier, professor of biochemistry at the Faculty of Science of the University of Paris, called on intellectuals who do not belong to any political party to participate in the movement to defend peace, saying that it is the responsibility of intellectuals to participate in the peace vote on October 2nd.
　　Professor Bernal, Archbishop Johnson, Crowther, chairman of the British Peace Committee, and Montague, a member of the committee, recently delivered speeches at a crowded meeting hall in Stepney, London, reporting on their impressions of attending the Moscow Peace Defenders Conference and calling for the defense of peace. The Stepney meeting turned into a powerful demonstration in support of peace and Anglo-Soviet friendship. The meeting enthusiastically passed a resolution guaranteeing active participation in the peace movement.
