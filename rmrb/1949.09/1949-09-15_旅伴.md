　　Traveling Companions
    By Soviet author Panova, translated by Su Ling, proofread by Cao Jinghua

    Part One: Night
    Chapter Four: Yulia

    In the hospital, in the operating room, Yulia was in charge, not Professor Si. Everyone understood this, so they were more afraid of her raised eyebrows than of Professor Si's thunderous anger. Once, Yulia caught the flu, and Professor Si stopped performing complex surgeries until she recovered. This made the staff even more convinced that Yulia could do without the professor, but the professor couldn't do without Yulia.

    The door to the dressing room burst open. Suplugov entered.

    "We're probably getting close," he said. His eyes darted around.

    The train was moving. Outside the window, it was still the same forests and grasslands as before. The sun was setting, and the tops of the forests were ablaze with red, while the train's shadow raced across the uncut grassy slopes.

    "It's sixty kilometers to Pskov," Suplugov said. "We haven't stopped at a single station since morning, have you noticed?"

    The reason he sought her out was because only in her eyes could he see human care and love. The rest of the people seemed to have conspired to ignore him. It was true that Pena was fond of him, but it was nothing more than a woman's flirtation. Women had never moved him in the past, and now he simply loathed them.

    "They're practically leading us under the bombs," he said.

    "I don't know anything about that," Yulia said coldly.

    "Look at these trees," he said, "or we may not see them again."

    His eyes filled with tears. Yulia sighed. She was not afraid of bombs. During the war against Finland, she had served as a nurse at the front. She felt very comforted when he stood in front of her and talked to her. Her sigh was lovely.

    "Look, look!" Suplugov shouted.

    The forest suddenly opened up, and in the dark forest, in the dust and mist, there was a road. The road was packed with people: troops were moving, artillery was slowly advancing, and large trucks covered with tarpaulins were flowing continuously. A man on horseback was racing along the side of the road, chasing the trucks. All of this flashed before their eyes, then was obscured by the forest again.

    "Retreating," Suplugov said, wringing his hands. "But we're heading towards where they're retreating."

    "I don't see it as a retreat," Yulia retorted. "What makes you think it's a retreat? Maybe it's just a normal troop movement. We can't know these things."

    "We do know," Suplugov raised his voice, "we know the enemy is attacking us, all the communiqués say so, but you pretend everything is fine. But tell me: why do you pretend like that? ... Even you can't say why."

    Why did he raise his voice and shout? He had never raised his voice to anyone—he didn't dare to speak loudly. Where did he get this confidence to raise his voice to her face?

    "I don't think everything is fine," she replied calmly. "I just said that maybe it's a troop movement, not a retreat. You can't prove that it's a retreat."

    Her mouth was stubbornly closed. She was unwilling to yield, not even for love.

    Black smoke surged past the train windows. The sun was still shining, but it felt like dusk was approaching. Breathing became difficult.

    "It smells like a fire," Danilov said. He was standing with Doctor Bilov in the corridor of the command car. Beside the railway base, there was a highway. Artillery, trucks, and infantry were moving along the highway in a dense, continuous stream. Now even Yulia might agree that this was probably a retreat. The troops were moving in the opposite direction to the train.

    "We're going to abandon Pskov," Danilov said in a low voice.

    The doctor watched, his nose constantly twitching. He wondered: had Igor left Pskov yet? Would he have time to leave? Of course, it was a fantasy to find his son in such a crowd. But what if they suddenly met? Sonya would be happy. He would take Igor onto the train. As a medic. Danilov wouldn't let him be naughty. In two or three months, he would be docile. Then the doctor would bring him to Sonya and say, "Look at the man's upbringing..."

    "We should close the windows," the doctor said loudly, "otherwise, the smoke will ruin the bedding. Pena," he said to the head nurse who was passing by, "please tell them to close all the windows."

    第一部　夜
    第四章　尤丽
    在医院里，在外科手术室里，主管其事的不是斯教授，而是尤丽。全体人员们都明白这一点，所以对她的扬眉，比对于斯教授的雷霆要怕得多了。有一次，尤丽得了流行感冒，斯教授就在她未恢复健康之前，停止行复杂的外科手术。这一层，使工作人员更相信尤丽离了教授可以过，而教授离了尤丽就不行了。
    裹伤室的门，猛然开了。苏普鲁戈夫进来。
    “我们大概快走近了，”他说道。他的眼睛在乱看着。
    火车在驶着。窗外依然同过去一样的，都是些森林和草原。夕阳西下了，森林的顶端，照得一片火焰似的通红，火车的影子，在草未收割的斜坡上飞奔着。
    “到普斯科夫有六十公里，”苏普鲁戈夫说。“我们从早晨起，连一站也没有停，你没有留意吗？”
    他所以去找她的，是因为只有在她的眼里他才能看出来人的关怀和慈爱。其余的人就仿佛都商量好了似的不睬他。诚然，裴娜对他是有好感的，可是这不过只是女子的卖弄风骚罢了。妇女们就是在过去也不曾使他动心过，而现在他简直厌恶起她们了。
    “简直把我们往炸弹下边带的呵，”他说着。
    “关于这一层，我一点也不知道，”尤丽冷冷的说。
    “你看看这些树吧，”他说，“或者以后我们看不见这些了。”
    他眼睛里充满了眼泪。尤丽叹息了一声。她是不怕炸弹的。在对芬兰战役中，她在前线当过看护的。他站在跟前对她谈着话，她是觉得很快慰的。她的叹息是可爱的。
    “看吧，看吧！”苏普鲁戈夫喊起来。
    森林豁然开朗了，黑黝黝的森林中，在尘雾里，有一条道路。道路上挤得水泻不通：军队在进行着，大炮在慢慢的移动着，盖着雨布的大卡车，连续不断的奔流似的行驶着。一个骑马的人，在路边上飞驰着，追赶着卡车。这一切在眼前闪了一下，就又被森林遮起了。
    “退却的，”苏普鲁戈夫搓着手说。“可是，我们就是向他们退却的地方去呢。”
    “我看不出来是退却的，”尤丽反驳着。“你从那见得这是退却呢？或许是平平常常的调防吧。我们不能够晓得这些事情呢。”
    “我们晓得的，”苏普鲁戈夫提高嗓子说，“我们晓得敌人在打我们的，所有公报上全这么说的，可是你却装着一切都是挺好的。可是，请问你：干吗你要装出这种神气呢？……连你自己也说不上来呵。”
    他为什么要提高嗓子大声说呢？他从来无论对谁都不曾提高过嗓子——他不敢高声说话呢。他那儿来的这种自信心，敢对她面提高嗓子说呢？
    “我并没认为一切都是挺好的，”她平心静气的回答着。“我只是说，这或许是调防，而不是退却。你不能证明说这是退却的。”
    她的嘴固执的紧闭着。她不愿让步，甚至为了爱，也不愿让步的。
    黑烟顺着车窗奔腾着。太阳还在照射着，可是觉得黄昏上来了似的。呼吸艰难起来了。
    “发着一股火灾气，”达尼洛夫说。他同比洛夫医生在司令车的走廊上站着。铁路基地上边，有一条公路。大炮、卡车、步兵、奔流似的，密集的沿公路行动着。现在连尤丽也许同意这大概是退却的了。军队向火车行驶的反对方向行动着。
    “我们要放弃普斯科夫了，”达尼洛夫低声儿说着。
    医生望着，鼻子时时在喘息着。他想道：伊戈尔离开普斯科夫了没有，他来及来不及离开呢？在这样人山人海中去找着儿子，这当然是幻想呵。可是他们突然要遇到了呢？梭妮一定是高兴了。他把伊戈尔接到火车上。当卫生兵吧。达尼洛夫不叫他淘气呢。两三个月以后，他就温顺起来了。那时医生就把他带给梭妮说：“你瞧瞧男子的教养吧……”
    “应当把窗子关起来，”医生大声说，“不然，烟把被服都要薰坏了，裴娜，”他对走过的看护长说，“请你吩咐叫把窗子都关起来吧。
