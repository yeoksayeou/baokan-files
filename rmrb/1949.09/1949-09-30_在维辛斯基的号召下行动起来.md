　　Acting Under the Call of Vyshinsky
    The speech delivered by Vyshinsky, head of the Soviet delegation, at the United Nations General Assembly on the 23rd of this month, and the proposals he made on behalf of the Soviet government to condemn the US-British bloc for preparing for a new war, oppose the establishment of aggressive military blocs, demand the unconditional prohibition of the use of atomic weapons, and conclude a convention to strengthen world peace, have aroused warm praise and unanimous cheers among the Chinese people! The solemn declaration of the Soviet government fully conforms to the will and desire of the Chinese people to fight for peace. It is also a common program for the people of all countries to strengthen world peace, ensure their own security, and overthrow the imperialist elements. The Chinese people will spare no effort to fight for its realization.
    The Soviet government's peace proposals once again demonstrate the consistency and firmness of the Soviet Union's peace policy. At successive sessions of the United Nations General Assembly, the Soviet government, with the support of the New Democratic countries and peace-loving people around the world, has waged unyielding and tenacious struggles. The Soviet government has repeatedly proposed the prohibition of the use of heinous atomic weapons and advocated international control of atomic energy; it has repeatedly opposed the expansion of armaments and advocated disarmament; it has repeatedly opposed all kinds of aggressive military and political alliances, firmly defended the UN Charter, and adhered to the principle of unanimity among the great powers; it has repeatedly exposed and condemned the various activities of the US and British in preparing for a new war, faithfully guarding the interests of the people of the world and friendly cooperation between countries; it has repeatedly exposed the crimes of US and British imperialists in using the authority of the United Nations as a cover to continue their enslavement of small countries, opposed the use of violence by the US and Britain against the people of Greece, Palestine, and South Korea, advocated that all foreign troops must withdraw from these countries, and strived to help these countries seek the right to decide their own future. The Soviet Union's firm peace policy and all its efforts for peace have greatly encouraged the struggle of the people of the world for peace. Now people can clearly see that the peace camp, headed by the great Soviet state and supported by the people of all countries, is many times stronger than the imperialist war camp. In the face of the power of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, the atomic myth has gone bankrupt! The paper tiger has been exposed! The power of the people is incomparably great, like a raging tide impacting all fascist war-mongers!
    We firmly believe that the Soviet Union's peace proposals will make the greatest contribution to promoting the world peace movement. Look, the people of the whole world are launching an unprecedentedly high tide of struggle for peace in various ways. The world-scale peace demonstration on October 2 will more fully prove the incomparably powerful force supporting the Soviet Union's peace proposals.
    The Chinese people, in the capacity of masters of the People's Republic of China, declare: We resolutely support the Soviet Union's peace proposals, and we condemn the preparations made by US imperialism for a new war in the Far East. They vainly attempt to seize Taiwan, rearm Japan, and turn Japan and the Philippines into their military bases. We condemn the crimes of US imperialism in vainly attempting to continue to support the Kuomintang bandit gang that is dying. We are doing our best to clear away the remaining forces of US imperialism in China and cut off the claws of the war-mongers! Liberate all of China!
    We fully agree with the conclusion of a convention to strengthen peace by the five permanent members of the Security Council, the Soviet Union, China, the United States, the United Kingdom, and France. The realization of this convention will mean taking a big step on the road to peace and security and is absolutely necessary to eliminate the danger of a new war and ensure world peace. However, it should be pointed out that the representatives of the Kuomintang bandit gang in Guangzhou, who have violated the will of the Chinese people and usurped the seat of representation at the United Nations General Assembly, are not only a great insult to the Chinese people, but also detrimental to the United Nations itself, which aims to maintain world peace and security! We absolutely cannot tolerate the bandits using the United Nations platform to slander the Chinese people and slander China's great friend, the Soviet Union, in the hope of achieving their goal of selling out national interests to US imperialism. We support the solemn declaration of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference to the world: denying the qualifications of all representatives sent by the Kuomintang bandit gang remaining in Guangzhou to attend the United Nations meeting. The soon-to-be-established Central People's Government is the only government that can represent the Chinese people! Only when the representatives sent by the Chinese People's Government attend the United Nations General Assembly will world peace be more guaranteed. We must act under the call of Vyshinsky, head of the Soviet delegation!

　　在维辛斯基的号召下行动起来
    苏联代表团团长维辛斯基于本月二十三日在联合国大会上的演说以及他代表苏联政府所提出的对美英集团进行新战争准备的谴责，反对建立侵略性军事集团与要求无条件禁止使用原子武器的建议，缔结加强世界和平公约的建议，已经在中国人民中间引起了热烈的赞美和一致的欢呼！苏联政府的庄严声明，完全符合于中国人民为和平而斗争的意志和愿望，也是各国人民加强世界和平、保障自身安全、打倒帝国主义分子的共同斗争纲领，中国人民将为着它的实现而竭尽全力去奋斗。
    苏联政府的和平建议再次显示了苏联和平政策的一贯性和坚定性。在历次的联合国大会上，苏联政府在新民主国家和世界爱好和平人民支持下都进行了不屈不挠的顽强斗争，苏联政府一再建议禁止使用罪恶的原子武器，主张原子能的国际管制；一再反对扩充军备，主张裁军，一再反对各种侵略性的军事政治联盟，坚决维护联合国宪章，坚持大国一致的原则；一再揭露与谴责美英进行新战争准备的各种活动，忠实地警卫着世界人民的利益和世界各国间的友好合作；一再揭穿美英帝国主义分子利用联合国的权威作掩护来继续其奴役小国的罪行，反对美英以暴力加于希腊、巴勒斯坦与南朝鲜等国的人民，主张一切外国军队必须从这些国家撤出，努力帮助这些国家谋取自行决定其前途的权利。苏联坚定的和平政策以及这一切为和平的努力大大鼓励了世界人民为和平而进行的斗争，现在人们可以清楚看到，以伟大苏维埃国家为首，有着各国人民支持的和平阵营，比帝国主义的战争营垒不知强大到几多倍。在苏联及人民民主国家威力面前，原子神话是破产了！纸老虎被戳穿了！人民的力量无比壮大，象怒潮一样冲击着一切法西斯战争贩子！
    我们坚信苏联的和平建议对于推动世界和平运动，将会有最大的贡献，请看，全世界人民正以各种各样的方式掀起了空前高涨的和平斗争浪潮，十月二日世界规模的和平示威便将更充分地证明支持苏联和平建议的无比强大的力量。
    中国人民以中华人民共和国国家主人翁资格宣告：我们坚决拥护苏联和平建议，我们谴责美帝国主义在远东制造新战争的准备，他们妄图攫夺台湾，重新武装日本，变日本，菲律宾为其军事基地；我们谴责美帝国主义妄图继续支持死在旦夕的国民党匪帮的罪行。我们正以全力扫清美帝国主义在中国的残余力量，斩断战争贩子的爪牙！解放全中国！
    我们完全同意由安理会常任理事国苏、中、美、英、法五国缔结加强和平的公约，实现这一公约，将意味着在和平与安全的道路上跨进了一大步，对于消弭新战争危险与确保世界和平是完全必要的。但应当指出：违背中国人民意志窃据在联合国大会代表席位的广州国民党匪帮代表则不仅对于中国人民是一个大污辱，而且有损于旨在维护世界和平和安全的联合国本身！我们断不能容忍匪徒们利用联合国讲台诽谤中国人民，诽谤中国伟大友人—苏联，以冀达到其出卖民族利益给美帝国主义的目的。我们拥护中国人民政治协商会议对全世界的庄严宣言；否认残留在广州的国民党匪帮所派出席联合国会议所有代表的代表资格。即将成立的中央人民政府是唯一能代表中国人民的政府！也唯有中国人民政府派遣的代表出席联合国大会，世界和平才有着更大的保障。我们要在苏联代表团团长维辛斯基的号召下行动起来！
