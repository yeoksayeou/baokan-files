　　Thoughts on the All-Circles Representative Conference of Beiping
    Chen Yuan
    We have gained an understanding of the situation of the All-Circles Representative Conference of Beiping. We must then think, have we seen such a conference before the liberation? Let me speak for myself, such a conference, I have never seen before. Because in China, under any previous regime, there was only feudal autocracy, or false democracy, and no government ever truly did anything for the common people. Many people know that I used to be unwilling to concern myself with politics. Why? Because all the politics I saw never satisfied me, and every government was dark and disheartening. I had never seen good politics before, so I thought that anyone involved in politics would do a bad job and be disappointing. Therefore, I had to take a passive approach and not concern myself with politics. Of course, this attitude should now be re-examined, but all the governments I had seen before were dirty, what could I do? Now it is different. Since the liberation, I have carefully observed all the measures and decrees of the government, and they are fundamentally different from before. Needless to say, just look at their promotion of a hard-working and simple style, without any habits of extravagance and enjoyment, which is unprecedented. All the staff working in the government, apart from those retained from the original organs, are people who work without receiving salaries, which is indeed the most cost-effective and honest government in history. They try to minimize their own demands and gradually try to improve the lives of the people. Do they all want to suffer hardships from birth? No, it is because they are willing to "be responsible to the people." They have a long-term vision, and they are thinking of all the working people in China and even the world. With people holding this attitude to serve our common people, where can we find corrupt officials and dark politics? Living under such a government, what reason do we have to be disheartened with politics and not concern ourselves with politics?
    Some time ago, someone asked me what I had seen that was different after the liberation of Beiping. I told him, let's not talk about what I saw, I'll tell you what I didn't see. After the liberation of Beiping, I didn't see soldiers beating people, I didn't see policemen beating rickshaw pullers, I didn't see beggars on the streets, I didn't see government officials indulging in feasting and drinking all day long, I didn't see people seeking personal favors and giving bribes to officials, and I didn't see so-called "new nobles" buying antiques in Liulichang. Although these are only superficial phenomena, these superficial phenomena show that the government has undergone a fundamental change in essence. This is different from previous dynastic changes, and it is indeed an unprecedented and earth-shattering great change in history. Since it is earth-shattering, and since we have recognized the essence of the government, then we must cherish this government, and we must supervise this government and assist the government, to use our own strength, in coordination with practical work, to promote the government's policy program. We should further unite and no longer rely entirely on the government to solve difficulties. We should implement the resolutions of this All-Circles Representative Conference in our own specific work. For example, as the resolution says, streamlining and saving, eliminating special agents, etc., since the end of the conference, factories, schools, and enterprise departments have already begun to take action to implement the conference resolutions, and our school should also implement them as soon as possible. Each unit, faculty and staff association, student union, and trade union, etc., should quickly hold separate meetings and discuss separately: 1. How to combine the conference resolutions with practical work, 2. The government work report and resolutions at the conference should be discussed as learning materials for a deeper understanding. We must unite closely, and under the dual tasks of supporting the front line and building a new Beiping, implement streamlining and saving, overcome all difficulties, and everyone should work together with the government with the greatest strength to complete this central task.

　　对北平各界代表会议的感想
    陈垣
    我们对北平各界代表会议的情况已有了认识。我们一定就会想到，在解放以前，我们是不是看见过这样的会议呢？别人我先不说，就拿我自己说吧，这样的会议，我是从来没看见过的。因为在中国以往的无论是什么政权下，只有封建的专制，或者是假的民主，就没有一个政府是真正替老百姓办过一点事的。很多人都知道，我从前对于政治不愿闻问。为什么呢？就是因为所有我看见的政治，没有一次是使我满意的，没有一个政府不黑暗，不令人灰心的。我以前没看见过好的政治，就以为凡是办政治的就办不好，就令人失望，于是只好用消极的办法，对政治不闻不问，当然这种态度现在应从新批判，不过从前我看过的都是肮脏的政府，有什么法子呢？现在不同了，从解放以后，我静心的观察政府的一切措施，一切法令，真是基本上和从前不同了。不用说别的，就看他们提倡艰苦朴素的作风，没有一点奢华享受的习气，已经是从前所没见过的。政府所有工作的人员，除去原机关留用的不算外，都是不领薪水只办事的人，的确是历史上最省钱、最廉洁的政府。他们对自己的要求尽量降低，对人民的生活则逐渐设法改善。难道说他们都是生来就愿意吃苦的吗？不是的，就是因为他们肯“对人民负责”。他们眼光看得远，他们是为了全中国，以至于全世界的劳苦人民着想的。抱着这种态度的人，来替我们老百姓办事，还到那里去找贪污的官吏，那里去找黑暗的政治呢？我们在这样的政府之下生活，还有什么理由能对政治灰心、对政治不闻不问呢？
    前些时，有人问我北平解放后，你看见些什么和以前不同，我告诉他，看见的先不说，我告诉你看不见的。解放后的北平，看不见打人的兵，看不见打洋车夫的警察，街上看不见乞丐，看不见整天花天酒地的政府官吏，看不见托人情送官礼的事情，更看不见有所谓“新贵”在琉璃厂买古董，这些虽只是表面的现象，但这表面的现象，说明了政府实质上已有了根本的不同。这不同于以前的改朝换代，的确是历史上空前的、翻天覆地的大变革。既然是翻天覆地，既然认清了政府的本质，那我们必须要爱护这个政府，而且要督促这个政府、协助政府，来用我们自己的力量，配合实际的工作，去推动政府的施政纲领。我们应该进一步的团结，不再把困难完全依靠政府来解决。应当把这次各界代表会议的决议，贯彻到自己的具体工作中去。比如象决议所说的精简节约，肃清特务分子等等，从会议结束以后，各工厂，各学校，各企业部门都已经开始用行动来执行大会决议，我们学校也应该赶紧执行，各单位、教职员会、学生会、职工会等，都要赶快分别开会，分别讨论：一、怎样把大会决议，来配合实际工作，二、应当把会议上的施政工作报告和决议作为学习材料来讨论，作更深一步的了解。我们要紧密团结，在支援前线、建设新北平的双重任务下，实行精简节约，克服一切困难，每个人都应该以最大的力量，和政府共同努力，完成这个中心的工作。
