　　North China People's Supervisory Yuan
　　Replies to People's Accusations
　　Hoping to Continue Exposing Various Unhealthy Tendencies in All Localities

　　Since this Yuan announced the Regulations for Supervisory Correspondents, calling on the masses to supervise their own government, many people have reported to this Yuan about the unhealthy tendencies still existing in various localities, which is an excellent phenomenon. This is truly "people's supervision" in name and in fact. This Yuan has handled many of the incidents reported by the people separately, and now publicly replies to the following three cases through the newspaper, hoping that everyone will bravely expose the various hidden unhealthy tendencies in all localities, so that the people's government can better serve the people.

　　To Comrade Liu Yuchen:
　　Regarding your reflection that the Shijiazhuang Transportation Company was selling tickets for private merchants' flatbed trucks at 130,000 yuan per ticket, while the private merchants themselves were only selling them for 70,000 yuan, this Yuan sent a letter to the Ministry of Transportation to thoroughly investigate, and also ordered Liu Geng, the special commissioner of this Yuan working in Shijiazhuang, to investigate the truth on the spot. Afterwards, the company conducted a review, believing that its management was poor, its policy concepts were vague, it failed to reduce costs and maintain transportation, and instead sold tickets for private merchants' trucks at high prices, losing its state-owned position, and its actions were also naive. The Ministry of Transportation of North China has given the company's manager, Chen Chunli, a warning.

　　To Comrade Zheng Jixiang:
　　Regarding your reflection on June 26th about the overcrowding and chaotic order at Tianjin East Station on June 17th, and the improper attitude of the inspectors at the Cangxian checkpoint towards female passengers on June 6th, this Yuan has sent separate letters to the relevant departments to investigate. The Railway Department of the Chinese People's Revolutionary Military Commission paid great attention to this issue and immediately ordered the Pingjin Railway Administration to further review the allocation of vehicles, and sent personnel to investigate and found that the improper attitude towards female passengers was the action of inspectors from the Cangxian Local Public Security Bureau. This Yuan has sent another letter to the Hebei Provincial Public Security Bureau to investigate and handle the matter and report back. The issues you raised will definitely be properly handled.

　　To Comrade Jian Xuchu:
　　Regarding the case of Zhang Jianping, a cadre of the film team of the Political Department of the North China Military Region, who was reported by the Beiping Liberation Daily on May 14th for embezzling 90,000 yuan by privately taking six generators purchased from Huatai Electrical Appliance Store, this Yuan sent a letter to the North China Military Region on May 16th to investigate and verify the facts. The Political Department of the Military Region has sent the criminal to the military court for trial.

　　华北人民监察院
  　答复人民检举事件
    希望继续揭发各地各种不良作风
    本院自公布监察通讯员条例号召群众监督自己的政权以来，不少人民纷纷向本院检举各地尚存有之不良作风，这是极好现象。这真是名符其实的“人民监察”。本院对许多人民检举之事件均已分别处理，兹将下列三件借报端公开答复，希望大家勇敢揭发各地隐藏之各种不良作风，以便人民政权能更很好的为人民服务。刘雨辰委员：
    你反映石市运输公司代私商驶平汽车售票，每票索价十三万元，而当时私商只售七万元一事，经本院函请交通部澈查，又命在石市检查工作之本院刘绠专员就地检查真象。俟后该公司即进行检讨，认为经营管理不善，政策观念模糊，未能减低成本保持运输，却代私商汽车高价售票，丧失国营立场，行动亦属幼稚。华府交通部已给该公司经理陈纯礼以警告处分。郑吉祥君：
    你于六月二十六日反映六月十七日天津东车站乘客拥挤，秩序混乱，及六月六日沧县检查站检查员对妇女旅客态度不正派等问题，业经本院分函各有关部门检查，中国人民革命军事委员会铁道部对此问题极为注意，当即转令平津铁路管理局对调配车辆再加检讨，并派员查明对妇女旅客态度不正派系沧县地方公安局检查员所为，本院已另函河北省公安局查明处理具报。你提的问题定能得到妥善处理。见旭初君：
    五月十四日由北平解放报社转来你检举华北军区政治部电影队干部张建屏在华泰电料行购六部发电机私吃九万元贪污案，本院于五月十六日函华北军区调查属实，军区政治部已将该犯送军法处审理。
