Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 10th: TASS, New York, 8th: Although tens of thousands of protest letters against the Peekskill fascist snipers have flooded the office of New York Governor Dewey, the authorities have so far taken no steps to arrest and punish the thugs who injured more than 150 people in the September 4th riot. Furthermore, Dewey has not taken any measures to punish and investigate the state police. According to eyewitness reports, state police personally participated in beating audience members leaving the concert hall after the Robeson concert on several occasions. On September 6th, Norman, an editor of the Worker Daily, formally presented more evidence of police participation in the fascist attack on the Robeson concert audience. Norman reported that when his car left the concert venue, state police blocked his car, ordered the passengers out of the car, and brutally beat all the passengers with clubs. Norman said, "I was forced to pass through a line of fifteen to twenty policemen. Everyone hit me on the head or back with a club. I tried to run away, but they pushed me to the ground and continued to beat me. One policeman saw my left hand, which had been burned a week earlier, wrapped in a bandage, so he jumped on my hand and stomped his heel into the bandage, bruising a burned finger. They then dragged us back to the car, pushed us in, and told us to leave." One of the car passengers, Braxberg, chairman of the New York branch of the United Cannery, Agricultural, Packing, and Allied Workers of America, was beaten unconscious.

    罗伯逊音乐会结束后纽约州警察毒打听众
    【新华社北平十日电】塔斯社纽约八日讯：虽然成千成万封反对毕克斯吉尔法西斯分子狙击的抗议书涌入纽约州长杜威的办公室，但当局迄今仍未采取任何步骤逮捕和惩办在四日骚动中使一百五十余人受伤的棒喝队员。此外，杜威也未采取任何措置惩戒和查办州警察。据目击者报道，州警察在若干场合曾亲自参加殴打在罗伯逊音乐会结束后离开会场的听众。九月六日，工人日报编辑人员诺曼正式提出更多关于警察参加法西斯分子对罗伯逊音乐会听众攻击的证据。诺曼报道，当他乘坐的汽车离开音乐会会场时，州警察挡住他的汽车，命令乘客离开汽车，并用警棍痛打所有乘客。诺曼说：“我被迫在十五个到二十个警察排成的队形中间通过。每个人都用警棒在我的头上或背上痛打。我试图逃跑，他们把我推倒地上，继续敲打。一位警察看到我一周以前被烧毁的左手包着绷带，他就跳到我的手上，并把脚跟踏到绷带里，挫伤一个被烧伤的指头。他们后来又把我们拖到汽车边，把我们推进去，吩咐我们走”。一一位汽车乘客产联工厂与熔炼工人工会纽约分会主席勃拉克斯伯格，被打得不省人事。
