Public Security Bureau Criminal Investigation Detachment
  Cracks Drug Manufacturing Case
  Arrests Gold and Silver Offender Zhen Zehua
  [Report from this newspaper] The case of Hao Anzheng, Yang Yushan, and others manufacturing heroin (白面, "white flour"), after meticulous investigation by the Criminal Investigation Detachment of the Public Security Bureau, was completely solved a few days ago, and more than two hundred taels of semi-finished product, materials, heroin, and opium were seized. In mid-July, the Criminal Investigation Detachment discovered that Guan Rusheng, a resident of 8 Siyan Well, Qianmen Inner, was selling heroin. They immediately sent people to investigate and arrested Guan Rusheng at 8 Siyan Well, Qianmen Inner. After a brief interrogation, the suspect confessed the names and addresses of those storing and manufacturing heroin. That night, the Criminal Investigation Detachment separately arrested Hao Anzheng and Yang Yushan, the main culprits storing and manufacturing heroin, at 42 Nanlucao Garden, Qianmen Outer, and 10 Xicheng Patrol Hall Hutong, respectively. They also lay in wait at their homes and arrested Li Xiaochun and Ge Jinchen, two persons selling drugs. At Hao Anzheng's home, they seized thirty-five taels six mace and five fen of No. 3 heroin, as well as heroin semi-finished product (estimated to be able to produce more than one hundred taels of heroin), barbital, local anesthetic, nitric acid, borax, and strong acid, totaling forty-three taels and five mace. At Yang Yushan's home, they seized more than thirty-seven taels of heroin and opium, twelve taels of mirabilite and borax, and one hundred silver dollars. At Guan Rusheng's home, they seized nineteen taels of heroin and two taels of materials. Two taels of opium were found on Li Xiaochun. Various drug manufacturing tools were also seized.
  Hao Anzheng, Yang Yushan, and others are habitual offenders in drug manufacturing. During the rule of the Japanese invaders and the Kuomintang, they openly colluded with the enemy to sell and manufacture drugs. After liberation, not only did they not show remorse, but they continued to manufacture drugs. Now, the Criminal Investigation Detachment has completely cracked the case, and the suspects are currently under interrogation.
