Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, September 9th: Zhang Dingcheng, Chairman of the Fujian Provincial People's Government, and Vice Chairmen Ye Fei and Fang Yi, telegraphed a reply to Tan Kah Kee on September 3rd to express their gratitude. The telegram reads as follows:

To Mr. Tan Kah Kee, c/o Preparatory Committee of the New Political Consultative Conference, Peiping: Your telegram of August 31st is acknowledged. Following the complete victory in the Fuzhou campaign, most of Fujian Province has been liberated. Now that the People's Government has been newly established, the remaining Chiang bandits are still entrenched in Zhangzhou and Xiamen. Dingcheng and others are mobilizing the military and civilians to vigorously clear the remaining bandits from the province. The people of Fujian and overseas Chinese and their families have long suffered from the devastation of the Kuomintang's reactionary rule. They are in deep water and scorching fire, and their suffering is extreme. The People's Government is now gradually establishing revolutionary order in urban and rural areas, and is separately restoring industry, commerce, trade, and school education. However, due to the long-standing double impact of Chiang's disasters and natural calamities, all industries are withering, and a hundred things remain to be done. We must work together, persevere, and move forward to achieve success. We deeply admire your efforts for the democratic cause and your earnest concern for the people's livelihood in your hometown. From now on, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and with the assistance of the military and civilians throughout the country, we will surely overcome any difficulties caused by the Chiang bandits and achieve the goal of building a new, democratic Fujian for the people. We hope you will continue to provide us with guidance and encouragement. We hereby reply to your telegram and express our gratitude.

Zhang Dingcheng, Ye Fei, Fang Yi, September 3rd

　　福建人民政府主席张鼎丞等
  　电谢陈嘉庚
    【新华社福州九日电】福建省人民政府主席张鼎丞、副主席叶飞、方毅九月三日电复陈嘉庚致谢。电文如下：
    北平新政协筹委会转陈嘉庚先生：八月三十一日电悉。福州战役全胜后，闽省大部已告解放。现人民政府甫告成立，残余蒋匪尚窜守漳（州）厦（门），鼎丞等正动员军民奋力扫清省境残匪。闽省同胞及侨胞侨属久受国民党反动统治之摧残。水深火热，痛苦殊深。现人民政府正逐步建立城乡革命秩序，分别恢复工商贸易与学校教育。惟以蒋祸天灾久相交迫、各业凋零，百端待举，行当群策群力，坚忍前进，方期有成。先生为民主事业四方奔走，并殷殷以桑梓民生为念，至为钦佩。今后在毛主席领导下及全国军民协助下，定能克服蒋匪所给予的任何困难，达到建设人民民主的新福建之目的。尚希时赐教益，共资策励。专此电复，并申谢忱。
    张鼎丞、叶飞、方毅九月三日
