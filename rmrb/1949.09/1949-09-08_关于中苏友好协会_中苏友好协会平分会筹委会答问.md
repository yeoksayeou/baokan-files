　　Regarding the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association
  　Questions and Answers from the Preparatory Committee of the Beijing Branch of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association
    To the Editor:
    What are the specific procedures for the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association to recruit members? What qualifications are required for membership? Is the nature of this organization the same as that of ordinary "labor unions" and "student unions"? Since this organization is national in scope, shouldn't every Chinese person be a member? Why is it still recruiting members separately?
    Liu Guoliang, Lang Zhiming, Zhao Songnian, Li Yuwen, Huabei University Industrial College
    Messrs. Liu Guoliang, Lang Zhiming, Zhao Songnian, and Li Yuwen:
    Regarding your inquiries about membership recruitment, organization, and the nature of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, the Preparatory Committee of the Beijing Branch of the Association answers as follows:
    (1) The General Association of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association is a national leadership institution that directly guides local branches and promotes work related to Sino-Soviet friendship. Membership recruitment is handled by the branches. Our association is the Beijing Branch, and the scope of membership is limited to this city. It has several sub-branches, organized by factories, schools, government agencies, and organizations, and is directly under the leadership of our association.
    (2) Our association is a broad-based mass organization with the aim of consolidating and developing the friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union, facilitating cultural exchange between the two countries, and learning from the revolutionary and construction experiences of the Soviet Union. Any people of China and the Soviet Union who abide by the association's charter and support its aims are welcome to join the association and become members upon approval by a sub-branch (organizers do not need sub-branch approval or introduction).
    (3) Because of the aforementioned specific aims, our association not only includes people from all walks of life but is also an international organization with a broader mass base. In addition to Chinese citizens, Soviet expatriates can also participate, which is clearly different from labor unions and student unions.
    (4) All Chinese people can join local branches as members, but because: 1. We cannot allow anti-Soviet elements to infiltrate; 2. Some people, influenced by malicious propaganda from reactionaries, do not have a further understanding of Sino-Soviet relations, or hold some incorrect prejudices, and these people are not yet willing to be members; at the same time, members have stipulated obligations and rights, and must also pay a certain amount of membership dues each month; the development of members is purely based on the principle of voluntary participation, so it cannot include all Chinese people.

　　关于中苏友好协会
  　中苏友好协会平分会筹委会答问
    编辑同志：
    关于中苏友好协会吸收会员事，具体的办法是怎样的呢？具备什么条件才能入会？这个组织的性质也和一般的“工会”、“学生会”一样吗？这个组织既然是全国性质的，每个中国人民都应当是会员才对。为什么还另吸收会员呢？
    华大工学院刘国梁、郎志铭、赵松年、李玉文
    刘国梁、郎志铭、赵松年、李玉文诸先生：
    你们所询关于中苏友好协会吸收会员、组织及性质等问题承该会北平市分会筹委会解答如下：
    （一）中苏友好协会总会系全国性的领导机构，直接指导各地分会，推选有关中苏友好的工作。吸收会员均由分会办理。本会系北平市分会，会员范围仅限于本市，下设若干支会，以工厂、学校、机关、团体为组成单位；直接受本会领导。
    （二）本会系广大群众性的组织，以巩固和发展中苏两国人民友谊，沟通中苏两国文化，学习苏联的革命和建设经验为宗旨。凡服从本会会章和赞成本会宗旨之中苏两国人民愿意入会者，经支会通过（发起人勿须支会通过或介绍）即可成为本会会员。
    （三）本会由于上述特定的宗旨，故不但包括各阶层人士，且系国际性的组织，群众基础更为广泛，除本国人民可为会员外，苏联侨民亦可参加，与工会、学生会显然不同。
    （四）凡属中国人民本来都可参加各地分会为会员，但因：一、我们不能允许反苏分子混入，二、有一部分人因受反动派恶意宣传的影响，对于中苏关系没有进一步的了解，或者存着某种不正确的偏见，这种人尚不会自愿为会员；同时会员有规定的义务和权利，每月还须缴纳一定的会费；对于会员的发展纯系根据自觉自愿的原则，故不能包括全体中国人民。
