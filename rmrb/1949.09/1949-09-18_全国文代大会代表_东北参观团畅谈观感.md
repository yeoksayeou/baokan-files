　　National Literary and Art Congress Representatives
  　Northeast Visiting Group Discusses Impressions
    [Special report from this newspaper] The Northeast visiting group of more than thirty representatives of the National Literary and Art Congress returned to Beiping on the tenth of this month, and some representatives have already gone south. Yesterday, our reporter specially visited some of the representatives who remained in Beiping, and they expressed their views to the reporter orally or in writing as follows:
    Chen Zhongfan: The Northeast is rich in resources. Although the industrial equipment was damaged by the Kuomintang, it has gradually restored its former appearance through the efforts of the Communist Party and the working class, as well as Soviet assistance. The prospects for future development are truly limitless. What interests me most is that workers' demands for culture have been increasing with the improvement of their lives. Each factory has established clubs and cultural centers to promote literacy campaigns and various recreational activities; there are also "Workers' Homes," which integrate workers' lives, education, and entertainment. At the same time, the Dalian area has already reached the point where there are no beggars, prostitutes, or thieves in the entire city, which can truly be called a model of the new China.
    Wang Gong: This time we visited the heart of the new Northeast—Shenyang; Harbin on the Songhua River; Changchun, which has risen from the dead; Dalian and Lushun, which have promoted a high degree of Sino-Soviet friendship; and Anshan, Benxi, and Fushun, the bases of heavy industry in the Northeast. In factories, mines, farms, schools, and even prisons, we have seen the people's Northeast growing and developing by leaps and bounds. Factories have been rebuilt from dilapidated ruins, schools are moving towards regularization, and every city has been revived, bursting with unprecedented fresh vitality and organizational power. Like Dalian, it is difficult to see pedestrians on the wide roads during the day, and everyone has entered production and work posts. After arriving in the Northeast this time, I have concretely seen the brilliant prospects of the new China.
    Zhao Wangyun: I usually pay more attention to rural life in my painting themes, so this Northeast visit made me most moved and excited by the land reclamation work in agriculture. In the suburbs of Harbin, there is a large farm of thousands of hectares, which was a barren land two years ago, but has now become a fertile farmland; and is planted with soybeans and sorghum, as well as the latest chicken coops and pigsties. It is said that on the north bank of the Songhua River, there is still an endless wilderness waiting for our working people to develop. Of course, this is only a matter of time. In the democratic Northeast, a new force has grown in all aspects. Thanks to the correct leadership of the Northeast People's Government, the saying "Labor creates the world" has been proven to be completely true with facts. I think that in a few years, the wilderness on both sides of the Songhua River will become beautiful farmland.
    Zang Yunyuan: We spent forty days in the Northeast. In Harbin, we saw large farms, martyrs' halls, and lime factories. In Shenyang, Anshan, Fushun, and Benxi, we saw how workers responded to the call of their superiors, worked hard to learn, and enthusiastically participated in the competition to restore production from political awareness to technical improvement, contributing equipment, saving materials, and manufacturing alternative machine parts, demonstrating the working class's high degree of master consciousness and collective wisdom. The enthusiasm for production and the creativity of workers have greatly improved productivity and rapidly restored factories under the correct leadership of the leaders relying on the workers. Anshan Iron and Steel and Fushun Mining Bureau both held labor model conferences, selecting thousands of labor models from tens of thousands of workers. These outstanding workers who take the lead in production and have a high degree of political awareness and technical level will be a powerful backbone for building a new Anshan Iron and Steel and a new Fushun. Technicians and workers learn from each other and cooperate so well, improving each other, and our productivity will soon exceed the previous level.
    Li Changzhi: What I want to talk about is my impression of the cultural and educational institutions I visited in the Northeast. First, the current educational policy in the Northeast is planned to adapt to economic construction. Second, the educators in the Northeast have given full play to their creativity; like industrial construction, they often carry out their work in extremely difficult and arduous environments, sometimes simply from scratch. This is very touching. Third, education in the Northeast is gradually moving from short-term training to regularization. Fourth, judging from the four universities we visited (Northeast University, Dalian University, China Medical University, Northeast Medical University), the labor point of view has been fully developed in school education (such as students going to the countryside regularly or helping to build school buildings), collective mutual aid life (for example, students' scores are not only calculated based on their own grades, but also the grades of helping others), and the spirit of linking theory with actual life (such as the connection between Dalian University and local factories). Fifth, cultural institutions outside the school that are particularly educational: the Harbin Martyrs' Hall, which lets us know the hardship of the revolutionary process and who led the War of Resistance; the Shenyang Museum, where the evolution of production tools displayed can be said to be a concrete history of social development. These should all be promoted. Sixth, in the construction of cultural and educational undertakings in the Northeast, many places have benefited from the assistance of Soviet experience, which is more obvious in Dalian. This makes us believe that it will definitely develop according to this trend in the future, which makes us feel very gratified.
    Jiang Tianzuo: Visiting for a month is better than reading for a year, at least that's how I personally feel. I have longed for a free and liberated new society for a long, long time. But this time I began to truly recognize the face of the new society. I have heard about the importance of production and construction for some time, but now I am beginning to truly appreciate the great content of production and construction. I don't understand economics or production and construction, but I appreciate a great thing: labor will not only change the material face of the world, but also change the spiritual face of the world. This truth is becoming more and more obvious on our new democratic production front.
    Huang Yaomian: What impressed me most during this trip to the Northeast was when we arrived in Anshan, the entire area was filled with chimneys, and the sky was filled with black smoke, but there were very few idlers on the street. It happened to be the time when labor models were being selected, and the enthusiasm for production was really exciting. In the past, in the old society, whoever consumed the most was the most respected; now it is completely the opposite, whoever produces the most is the most respected. What everyone is vying for is not fame, status, or money, but who can really produce wealth for the country. This situation, I think, is of great educational significance for some intellectuals.
    Ling He: In Dalian, our visiting group watched two performances of dramas by the Gorky Coastal Theatre Troupe from Vladivostok. In addition to the detailed Stanislavsky performance method that benefited us a lot, after the event, all the artists of the troupe invited us to a forum. The head of the troupe, Sufimov, told us in detail about the internal situation of the troupe and various situations of the Soviet drama movement, as well as the specific application of the Stanislavsky performance system and the organic unity of Marxism-Leninism, which gave us a more complete understanding. During the forum, we talked about how the Chinese theater movement will serve workers, peasants, and soldiers under the banner of Mao Zedong, and all the members of the troupe applauded enthusiastically and were extremely excited. There we met four Soviet officers who had dinner with our representatives who studied drama and film. We talked freely about the enthusiastic joy that the victory of the Chinese revolution and the gradual restoration and development of construction undertakings aroused among the Soviet people. They spoke very fluent Chinese. During the dinner, we raised our glasses and toasted the health of the leaders of the two countries four times.

　　全国文代大会代表
  　东北参观团畅谈观感
    【本报专访】全国文代大会代表东北参观团一行三十余人于本月十日返抵北平后，已有部分代表南下。昨天记者特往访了留平部分参观代表，他们口头或书面向记者发表观感如下：
    陈中凡：东北物产丰富，工业设备虽被国民党破坏，但是经过共产党和工人阶级的努力，以及苏联帮助，现在已渐渐恢复旧观。将来发展的前途，真是未可限量。最使我感到兴趣的是工人因为生活改进，对于文化的要求已日益增高，各工厂都有俱乐部和文化馆的设立，推行识字运动和各种文娱活动；还有“工人之家”，把工人们的生活、教育、娱乐融成一炉。同时，在大连区，现在已经做到全市没有乞丐、娼妓、小偷的地步，真可以说是新中国的模范。
    汪巩：我们这次参观了新东北的心脏——沈阳；松花江边的哈尔滨；从死亡走向新生的长春；发扬了高度中苏友好精神的旅大；和东北重工业的基地鞍山、本溪、抚顺等地。在工厂、矿山、农场、学校，甚至监狱里，都看到人民的东北在成长，在飞跃的发展。工厂从残破的废墟上重建起来，学校正在走向正规化，每一座城市都复活了，而且迸发出空前未有的新鲜活力和组织力。象大连，白天在广阔的马路上很难看到行人，所有的人都进入了生产和工作岗位。这次到了东北，我才具体地看到了灿烂的新中国的远景。
    赵望云：我平素在绘画题材上多注意在农村生活这方面，所以这次东北参观使我最感动最兴奋的是农业的拓荒工作。在哈尔滨城郊，有一个数千顷的大农场，在两年前还是一片荒芜的土地，现在已成为肥沃的田园；并种满了大豆和高粱，还有最新式的鸡舍、猪舍。据说在松花江的北岸，还有无尽涯的荒芜土地，等待着我们的劳动人民去开发，当然这只是时间的问题了。在民主的东北，各方面已长成一种新生的力量，由于东北人民政府正确的领导，“劳动创造世界”这句话，已用事实证明了完全是一个真理。我想几年之后，松花江两岸的荒野，均将成为美好的农田。
    臧云远：我们在东北四十天，在哈尔滨看到了大农场、烈士馆、石灰厂。在沈阳、鞍山、抚顺、本溪，看到了工人怎样响应上级的号召，努力学习，从政治觉悟到技术提高，热烈地参加了恢复生产的竞赛运动，献出器材，节省材料，制造代用的机器零件，表现着工人阶级高度的主人翁的自觉和集体的智慧。生产的积极性，工人的创造性，在领导者依靠工人的正确领导下，生产力已大大提高，工厂迅速地恢复起来了。鞍钢和抚顺矿务局，都举行了劳动模范大会，从几万工人队伍里，选出上千的劳动模范。这一些在生产中带头，有着高度政治觉悟和技术水准的优秀工人，将是建设新鞍钢新抚顺的有力骨干。技师和工人互相学习，团结合作得那样好，互相提高，我们的生产力，很快地就要超过以往的水平了。
    李长之：我要谈的是我在东北所参观的文化教育机关的印象。第一，目前的东北教育方针是适应经济建设而计划的。第二，东北的教育工作者，充分地发挥了创造性；与工业建设一样，往往在极艰难困苦的环境下，展开他们的工作，有时简直是从无到有。这一点非常使人感动。第三，现在东北教育，已经逐渐从短期训练方式走入正规化。第四，从我们所参观的四个大学看来（东北大学、大连大学、中国医科大学、东北医科大学），学校教育中充分发挥了劳动观点（象学生定时的下乡或帮助修建校舍），集体的互助生活（譬如学生的分数，不只是计算他本人的成绩，而且还有帮助别人的成绩），理论和实际生活联系的精神（如大连大学和当地工厂的联系）。第五，学校之外，特别富有教育意义的文化机关：哈尔滨烈士馆，它让我们知道革命过程的艰辛，并知道抗战是由谁来领导的；沈阳博物馆，其中陈列的生产工具的演进，可以说是一部具体的社会发展史。这些都是应该推广的。第六，在东北文化教育建设事业中，有不少的地方得到苏联经验的借助，在大连表现的更为明显。这使我们相信将来一定是照着这个趋势发展的，这点使我们感到异常欣慰。
    蒋天佐：参观一个月，胜读一年书，至少我个人是这样感觉。向往于自由解放的新社会，是很久很久了。但是这次才开始真正认识了新社会的面目。听到生产建设的重要性也有好些时候了，但是现在才开始真正领略到生产建设的伟大内容。我不懂经济，也不懂生产建设，但是我体会到一种伟大的东西：劳动不仅会改变世界的物质面貌，而且会改变世界的精神面貌，这个真理在我们新民主主义的生产战线上表现得越来越明显了。
    黄药眠：这次到东北，使我获得印象最深的是当我们到鞍山的时候，整个区域排满了烟囱，天空黑烟缭绕，但街上却很少看见闲人。恰好那时正是评选劳动模范的时候，一股热腾腾的生产热情，真使人兴奋。过去旧社会，谁消费的最多，谁就最受人尊敬；现在完全相反，谁生产的最多，谁就最受人尊敬。大家所争的不是名誉、地位、金钱，而是谁真能替国家生产财富。这种情形，我想，对于某些读书人是有着极大的教育意义的。
    凌鹤：在大连我们参观团看过两次海参崴来的高尔基沿海剧团话剧的演出，除了细致的史达尼斯拉夫斯基表演方法叫我们得益不少而外，事后该团全体艺术家们邀请我们开座谈会。该团负责人苏菲莫夫不厌其详的告诉我们关于该团内部情形和苏联戏剧运动的各种情况，以及史达尼演剧体系的具体应用与马列主义有机的统一，更使我们得到比较完整的认识。在座谈会中我们谈到中国剧运将在毛泽东的大旗下，为工农兵服务，该团团员全体热烈鼓掌异常兴奋。在那里我们认识了四个苏联军官，他们曾经和我们研究戏剧电影的代表们共进晚餐，我们畅谈了中国革命的胜利和建设事业的逐渐恢复发展在苏联人民中间引起的热烈欢欣的情形。他们的中国话很流俐，席间我们举杯互祝两国领袖健康干杯四次之多。
