The Fruits of Arduous Struggle
    Recording the Second Day of the First Plenary Session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference
    Li Zhuang
    Yesterday was the day before the "Autumn Equinox," already mid-autumn weather, time to wear a jacket. But in the meeting hall of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), the electric fans were constantly running. The electric lights around the venue initially emitted a pale yellow, warm glow, later switched to fluorescent lights, and the color turned bluish-white. People's hearts were as warm as the weather, and the atmosphere in the venue was calm yet tense. Yesterday's agenda was to report on the preparations for the CPPCC and the drafting process of the three historical documents: the Organic Law of the CPPCC, the Organic Law of the Central People's Government, and the Common Program of the CPPCC. These were the fruits of the Chinese people's bloodshed, sweat, and arduous struggle. Every well-meaning Chinese person warmly welcomed their creation, resolutely guaranteed their implementation, and how could the representatives who personally participated in drafting these documents not feel particularly affectionate?
    Victory is achieved through long-term struggle. To appropriately inscribe the victory in the great charter of the Chinese people, the representatives adopted extremely appropriate attitudes and steps. If one were to summarize it in a few words, it would be: democracy, unity, seriousness, and responsibility.
    The Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) put forward the great call to convene the CPPCC in May of last year. The news spread like wildfire, rapidly throughout the country and overseas. Telegrams of response flew in like snowflakes, democratic figures from all sides arrived in the liberated areas one after another, and all democratic parties and the people of the whole country were united under the banner of "people's democratic dictatorship." On November 25th of last year, representatives of the CCP Central Committee and democratic figures who had already arrived in Harbin discussed the establishment of the CPPCC Preparatory Committee and the nature and tasks of the new CPPCC, and reached a common agreement. Everyone unanimously recognized the CCP's call as the common basis for the unity and struggle of the people of the whole country. By June 15th of this year, the CPPCC Preparatory Committee officially announced its establishment in Peiping.
    The Preparatory Committee spent nearly three months formulating the list of units, quotas, and candidates to participate in the CPPCC. To determine whether a certain representative was appropriate or not, letters and telegrams were exchanged back and forth, and it was reconsidered repeatedly, sometimes taking weeks. The Harbin Agreement stipulated that no reactionary elements were allowed to participate in the CPPCC, so finalizing the list was an extremely serious undertaking. The list was finally formulated under the principles of opposing imperialism, opposing feudalism, opposing bureaucratic capitalism, and establishing a people's democratic republic. A huge project was successfully completed. The representatives carefully listened to Lin Boqu's report on the preparatory work of the CPPCC, applauded warmly to congratulate him, and unanimously raised their hands to pass it in its entirety.
    The creation of the Common Program of the CPPCC also went through very careful efforts. The group responsible for drafting the program within the Preparatory Committee discussed it three times. The CPPCC representatives who had arrived in Peiping before the opening of the conference discussed it twice, and the Standing Committee of the Preparatory Committee also discussed it twice, before it became the final draft. It can be said that the opinions that should be concentrated from all sides have been concentrated. Broad democracy forged the great charter of the new China.
    The draft of the Organic Law of the CPPCC was also the crystallization of repeated research and careful discussion. The second group responsible for drafting this document held four meetings. First, they exchanged opinions and formulated a discussion outline, then, according to the outline, they studied the basic principles of the CPPCC organization, as well as the nature, functions, and relationship between the CPPCC and the government. At this time, a drafting committee was organized within the group to begin drafting. After the first draft was completed, it widely solicited opinions from all parties and revised it repeatedly. After discussing and sorting it out at the group meeting, it was submitted to the fourth meeting of the Standing Committee for approval. The group finally convened its fourth meeting, sorted out the text, and submitted it to the second plenary meeting of the Preparatory Committee for approval in principle, becoming the current draft.
    The process of creating the Organic Law of the Central People's Government was roughly similar to the above documents. The drafting group held three meetings, and the five-person drafting committee appointed by the group also held three meetings. They also specifically consulted experts. The fifth Standing Committee of the CPPCC discussed and revised the text, and submitted it to the second plenary meeting of the Preparatory Committee for approval in principle. At this conference, it will be finally studied and approved, thereby creating the central government of the People's Republic of China.
    Like the day before yesterday, yesterday's meeting successfully completed its agenda. It can be expected that the conference will be a complete success, because the preparatory work before the meeting was done too well. Full preparation in advance, careful consultation, and reaching completely unanimous opinions are a prominent feature of the CPPCC conference.

　　艰苦斗争的成果
  　记人民政协第一届全会第二天
    李庄
    昨天为“秋分”前一日，已是仲秋天气，该穿夹衣了。但在人民政协的会场上，电扇却始终转动着。会场周围的电灯，起初放散着淡黄的温暖的光芒，以后改开日光灯，颜色又变成青白了。人们的心和天气一样的温暖，会场的空气在平静中透着紧张。昨天的议程是报告人民政协筹备的经过，报告政协组织法、中央人民政府组织法和人民政协共同纲领这三个历史文件的起草经过。这是中国人民流血流汗艰苦斗争的成果，每一个好心的中国人，都在热烈欢迎它们的产生，坚决保证它们的实现，亲手参加起草这些文件的代表们，能不感到特别的亲切么？
    胜利是经过长期斗争得来的。为了把胜利恰当地写在人民中国的大宪章上，代表们采取了极为恰当的态度和步骤。如果要用几个字概括起来，那就是：民主、团结、严肃、负责。
    中共中央在去年“五一”提出召开人民政协的伟大号召。消息如野火飞传，迅速遍于全国和海外。响应的通电雪片飞来，各方民主人士络绎抵达解放区，各民主党派和全国人民都团结在“人民民主专政”的旗帜之下了。去年十一月二十五日，中共中央的代表和已经到达哈尔滨的民主人士，商讨成立新政协筹备会及新政协的性质任务等问题，获得了共同的协议，大家一致承认以中共的号召为全国人民团结奋斗的共同基础。至今年六月十五日，新政协筹备会在北平宣告正式成立。
    筹备会用了近三个月的工夫，拟订了参加人民政协的单位、名额和人选名单。为了某一个代表的适当与否，各方面函电往返，再四斟酌，有费时达数周之久的。哈尔滨协议中规定，不许任何反动分子参加人民政协，所以确定名单，实为一件极其严肃的事业。名单终于在反对帝国主义、反对封建主义、反对官僚资本主义，建立人民民主共和国的原则下拟定了。一件巨大工程圆满完工。代表们细心地听完林伯渠关于政协筹备工作的报告，热烈地鼓掌致贺，一致举手，全体通过。
    人民政协共同纲领的产生，同样经过了非常谨慎的努力。筹备会负责草拟纲领的小组曾经讨论过三次，大会开会前已到北平的人民政协代表讨论了两次，筹备会常委会也讨论了两次，始成最后的草案。可以说，各方面应该集中的意见都集中起来了。广泛的民主铸成了新中国的大宪章。
    人民政协组织法草案也是反复研究，慎重讨论的结晶。负责起草这个文件的第二小组就开过四次会。先交换意见，拟成讨论提纲，再按照提纲，研讨政协组织的基本原则，及政协的性质、职权与政府关系等问题。这时在小组内组织了起草委员会，开始着手起草。初稿完成，又广泛征求各方意见，一再修改，在小组会上讨论、整理后，始提请常委会第四次会议通过。小组最后召开了第四次会议，整理了文字，提请筹备会第二次全体会议原则通过，成为现在的草案。
    中央人民政府组织法的产生过程，和上面几个文件大体相似。起草小组开过三次会，小组推定的五人起草委员会也开过三次会，还特别征询了专家的意见。政协第五次常委会讨论修改了文字，送请筹备会第二次全体会原则通过。在这次大会上，将要最后研究与批准它，从而产生中华人民共和国的中央政府。
    和前天一样，昨天的会议顺利地完成了自己的议程。可以预期，大会一定会胜利成功的，因为会前的准备工作作得太好了。事先充分准备，慎重协商，取得完全一致的意见，这是人民政协会议一个显著的特点。
