TASS, Rome: Italian newspapers have published a dispatch from the United States stating that an agreement has been reached on a new plan for partitioning the former Italian colonies in Africa, as a result of secret meetings between the governments of the United States, Britain, and France. Under the new plan, Britain will gain trusteeship over Cyrenaica. The meeting decided that Abyssinia and British-Egyptian Sudan would divide Eritrea. Only Somaliland will be left under Italian administration.

French Police Brutally Suppress Vietnamese Workers in France. According to TASS: On August 29th, French police brutally beat and imprisoned Vietnamese laborers in the "Mazargues" concentration camp near Marseille. Two hundred laborers living in the camp began a hunger strike on August 30th to protest the police brutality. On the same day, according to Reuters, when Vietnamese workers in Marseille raised the Viet Minh flag, the police interfered and a conflict ensued. In Lyon, on August 29th, French soldiers on leave returning home also brutally beat Vietnamese workers.

Telegraphic Communication Society, Tokyo: The American military court in Osaka unreasonably sentenced six Japanese people on August 30th to five years in prison each for allegedly "defaming" the American occupation forces. It is said that the six defendants posted reports during the U.S. military exercises in Tsuruga in July, detailing numerous atrocities and crimes committed by American soldiers against Japanese residents.

In order to salvage its crumbling rule, the Burmese Thakin Nu reactionary government recently dispatched its Defense Minister Ne Win and Foreign Minister U E Maung to visit Britain and the United States to beg for assistance and discuss the issue of a "Pacific Anti-Communist Alliance." Following Ne Win's visit to Britain and the United States in July, U E Maung flew from Rangoon to London in early August, then to Washington on the 12th, returned to London on the 22nd, and finally left Britain for Burma on August 28th. During his visit to the United States, he held a series of meetings with American officials such as Truman and Acheson. According to a Reuters dispatch from Washington on the 19th, "Truman has assured him of all possible assistance under the Fourth Point program of U.S. aid to underdeveloped areas." At the same time, it is understood that U E Maung's visit to Britain and the United States is also related to the current efforts by American and British imperialism to actively orchestrate its Asian puppets to plan a "Pacific Anti-Communist Alliance."

Railway workers in Abyssinia recently held a strike against imperialist oppression. About half a month ago, workers on the railway from Addis Ababa, the capital of Abyssinia, to Djibouti, held demonstrations demanding higher wages. However, the workers' demands were rejected by the French-owned railway authorities, and the demonstrations were brutally suppressed. In anger, the demonstrators destroyed the Dire Dawa railway station and beat several French employees. Due to this unrest, railway traffic has not yet been restored. At the request of the French Minister, Emperor Haile Selassie has arrested several railway worker leaders and ordered them to be hanged.

    缅甸达钦努反动政府为挽救其摇摇欲坠的统治起见，最近先后派遣其国防部长奈温与外长宇伊蒙访问英美乞求援助，并商谈“太平洋反共联盟”问题。继七月间奈温访问英美之后，宇伊蒙于八月初由仰光飞赴伦敦，十二日又赴华盛顿，二十二日转返伦敦，最后于八月二十八日离英返缅。在访美期中，他曾与杜鲁门及艾奇逊等美国官员进行一连串的会议，据路透社华盛顿十九日电说：“杜鲁门已向他保证在美国援助世界落后地区第四项计划下给以一切可能的援助”。同时，据悉宇伊蒙访问英美之行，也与目前美英帝国主义积极策动其亚洲傀儡筹划“太平洋反共联盟”一事有关。
    阿比西尼亚铁路工人最近曾举行反对帝国主义压迫的罢工。约在半月以前，由阿国京城亚的斯亚巴巴至吉布底的铁路上的工人，曾举行示威，要求增加工资。但工人的要求遭到法国所有的铁道当局的拒绝，示威并遭到野蛮的镇压。示威者在愤激中捣毁了德瑞打瓦城的车站，殴打了法籍职员多名。由于这一骚乱，铁道交通迄今尚未恢复。在法国公使的要求下，阿皇塞拉西已逮捕铁路工人领袖若干人，并下令把他们绞死。
