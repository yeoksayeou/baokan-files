Strengthening Leadership in Autumn Agricultural Production

The busy autumn season has arrived. The North China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the North China People's Government, and local party committees and governments have successively issued instructions, calling on organizations at all levels to fully lead the autumn harvest, autumn plowing, and autumn planting work, to ensure that farmers obtain the fruits of their hard work throughout the year, and to lay a good foundation for large-scale production next year. Cadres in various regions should carefully study and implement these instructions and decisions; they should recognize that only by doing a good job in the autumn harvest, autumn plowing, and autumn planting can we guarantee military and civilian food supplies, reduce the losses caused by disasters, increase the exchange of agricultural and industrial products, enhance mutual assistance between urban and rural areas, create excellent conditions for large-scale industrial construction in the future, and more powerfully support the war.

Currently, in many liberated areas across the country, especially in areas like North China, the entire territory has long been liberated, the environment is stable, war service tasks have been reduced, and the vast majority of villages have completed land reform, resulting in an unprecedentedly high level of enthusiasm for production among the masses. These are all favorable conditions for this year's autumn production. Although some areas have suffered from disasters such as floods, droughts, insects, and hail, and individual places still have hidden bandits and special agents carrying out sabotage, these have had a considerable impact on the bountiful autumn harvest. However, the well-tested farmers of North China, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, have sufficient strength to overcome difficulties. We not only have rich experience in fighting against disasters, but also have valuable experience in organizing autumn production for many years. As long as we strengthen leadership and specifically solve some concrete difficulties in harvesting, plowing, and planting for the masses, things can be done well. Past experience has proven that county and district cadres must go deep into the villages to lead production. If the force of leadership cannot reach the villages, and if the leadership's intentions cannot be transformed into the actions of the broad masses, then instructions and calls will inevitably become empty words and cannot be concretely realized.

This year, in the face of severe disasters in various parts of North China, the ability to maintain a considerable level of agricultural production is entirely due to the cadres and party members in various regions leading the masses in the agricultural production front, fighting against various disasters and difficulties, working day and night, organizing the masses to fight drought and plant crops, repairing canals and controlling water, and extinguishing insect pests... reducing the losses caused to the masses by various natural disasters. However, it is undeniable that a considerable number of cadres still hold a laissez-faire attitude in production leadership. They think, "Which farmer doesn't know how to produce?" "I am not as good as the old farmer"... Therefore, they are unwilling to go deep among the masses, study the problems existing in production, and solve the difficulties in production for the masses, and are often busy with some temporary surprise tasks (of course, these tasks also need to be completed). This is a major obstacle to the current development of autumn production work and must be vigorously overcome. Although, in many places, the two tendencies of both paternalistic control and laissez-faire coexist, the tendency of laissez-faire is basic or major, and must be overcome in order to lead the autumn production well.

The agricultural saying goes, "Seize the autumn and grab the summer," and "If the solar terms are missed, the whole year is wasted," indicating the urgency of the autumn production season. To prevent the sudden attacks of wind, frost, and insect disasters in a timely manner, we must rush to harvest; to increase wheat production according to the solar terms, we must rush to plant; to restore soil fertility and prevent diseases and pests, we must organize a large amount of manpower and livestock to rush to plow. All of these require our cadres to highly exert their leadership effectiveness, be good at organizing the masses according to specific conditions, seize the season, distinguish between priorities and urgencies, and complete the complex and important tasks of autumn production.

### 加强秋季农业生产的领导

　　加强秋季农业生产的领导
    秋忙季节已经到了。中共中央华北局、华北人民政府及各地党委、政府均先后发布指示，号召各级组织全力领导秋收秋耕秋种工作，保证农民取得一年来辛勤劳动的成果，并为明年的大生产打好基础。各地干部应该认真研究，贯彻执行这些指示和决定；应该认识，只有作好秋收秋耕秋种的工作，才能保证军需民食，减少灾荒给予我们的损失，增进农业品与工业品的交换，增进城乡互助，给今后大规模的工业建设创造优良的条件，并且更有力地支援战争。
    目前在全国许多已解放的地区，特别象华北这样的地区，全境早已解放，环境安定，战勤任务减少，绝大部分乡村又已完成了土地改革，群众生产情绪空前高涨，这些都是今年秋季生产的良好条件。虽然部分地区遭受水、旱、虫、雹等灾害，个别地方尚有潜藏匪特的破坏，给予丰盛的秋收以不少影响，但久经考炼的华北农民，在共产党和人民政府的领导下，是有足够力量战胜困难的。我们不但有丰富的与灾荒作斗争的经验，而且有多年组织秋季生产的宝贵经验，只要加强领导，具体解决了众群收、耕、种的若干具体困难，事情是可以作好的。过去的经验证明，县区干部领导生产，必须深入到村，如果领导的力量不能达到村，不能把领导意图变为广大群众的行动，则指示和号召必将成为一纸空文，无法具体实现。
    今年华北各地，在灾荒严重的袭击下，所以能够保持农业生产的相当成绩，完全是由于各地干部党员在农业生产战线上，率领群众同各种灾荒、各种困难做斗争，昼夜奔忙，组织群众抗旱点种、修渠治水、扑灭虫害……减少了各种天灾给予群众的损失。但是不可否认，还有相当一部分干部，在生产领导上存在着自流主义的观点。他们想：“农民谁不会生产？”“吾不如老农”……于是就不肯深入群众，研究生产中存在的问题，解决群众生产中的困难，而常忙于一些临时的突击任务（当然这些任务也是需要完成的），这是当前开展秋季生产工作的一大障碍，必须努力打破。虽然，在不少地方，包办代替与放任自流两种偏向同时存在，但自流的偏向却是基本的或主要的，必须克服，才能把秋季生产领导得好。
    农谚有所谓“抢秋夺夏”，又有所谓“节气一错，一年白过”，说明秋季生产季节性的紧迫，要及时防止风、霜、虫灾的突然袭击，就必须抢收；要按照节令种麦增产就必须抢种；要休养地力防止病害就必须组织大量的人力畜力进行抢耕。这些又无一不需要我们干部高度发挥领导效能，善于根据具体条件组织群众，抓紧季节，分别轻重缓急，完成秋季生产的复杂而重要的任务。
