Second Saturday Voluntary Labor
　Two Thousand Youths Participate in Reopening the Jianguomen Project
　　[Reported by this newspaper] Following the previous two occasions when over eight thousand youths participated in voluntary labor, working on the construction of Tiananmen Square and surveying traffic volume, the broad masses of Beiping youth have a unanimous desire: to engage in long-term Saturday voluntary labor, dedicating their labor to the construction of the People's Capital. In order to provide Beiping youth with the opportunity to continue participating in voluntary labor, the Preparatory Committee of the Municipal Youth League decided to cooperate with the Construction Bureau in the work of opening up Jianguomen. On Saturday (the 17th) afternoon, eight hundred young students were mobilized, and on Sunday (the 18th), sixteen hundred young workers were mobilized to participate in the work of demolishing bricks and transporting soil to open the breach.

    【又讯】建设局为配合恢复与发展东郊工业区，便利城乡交通起见，决定按照各界代表会议的决议，重开被国民党堵砌的建国门。由于各界人士对此要求十分迫切，建设局已决定本月十七日即动工兴修，首先开辟一个八公尺宽的豁口，安装木门一座。该门外护城河上修建可负荷十吨的木便桥一座的工程，已于九月上旬开工，将可与开辟豁口的工程先后完工。　　　　　（市府新闻处）
