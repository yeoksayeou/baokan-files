A History of American Aggression Against China
    Liu Danian
  　III. The Struggle for Hegemony in China (Continued from XV)
    From the First Zhili-Fengtian War in 1922 to the Second War in 1924, the United States made large-scale investments in the Zhili warlords. In terms of financial resources: the United States shipped the Zhili faction military supplies worth 3.28 million yuan, as well as 10,000 rifles, 2 million rounds of ammunition, and 250 machine guns. An American, Borgia, set up an aircraft factory for the Zhili faction in Luoyang. They also worked with the Zhili faction's Qi Xieyuan on the "Guide the Huai River" loan to raise military expenses. In politics: The American Minister to Beijing went to Baoding to meet with Cao Kun regarding the "highest issues," pushing Cao Kun onto the stage. President Warren G. Harding personally instructed Cao Kun on how to conduct bribery elections, saying: "The American banking consortium can help China unify." When the bribery election took place, the American Minister alone went to "observe" to support Cao Kun. After the results were announced, the American Minister was the first to congratulate him, expressing "recognition," and supported the pro-American diplomatic faction led by Gu Weijun. During the war, American ships were used to transport military supplies to Xiamen, Tianjin, and other places for the Zhili faction. Gunboats were also used in Changsha to help the Zhili faction's pawn, Zhao Hengti, repel Tan Yankai. Finally, the American Secretary of State Hughes went to London to sign a secret agreement with Britain. Britain would instruct comprador Chen Lianbo of HSBC in the South to use the "Merchant Volunteer Corps" to expel Sun Yat-sen from Guangdong. The United States launched the Zhili-Fengtian War in the North, starting with the Jiang (Jiangsu, Zhili faction Qi Xieyuan) and Zhejiang (Zhejiang, Lu Yongxiang, who had connections with the Fengtian faction) wars, attempting to completely end Japanese influence and establish an American-Zhili "strong central government." This was the climax of the efforts made by the United States since the US-Japan struggle for hegemony in China in 1917. (Note: See the CCP Central Committee's second and third proposals on the current situation in July 1922 and September 10, 1924, and the "Guide" issue 18 on September 18, 1924.) Gao Junyu, "The Jiangsu-Zhejiang War and Foreign Imperialism."
    At this time, the United States, through the Zhili puppet, seized more Chinese rights than Japan. For example, when the Anhui clique was in power in 1918, the Beijing government signed a contract with Japan's Mitsui & Co. to build a wireless station in Beitongzhou, stipulating that Japan had management rights and that the Beijing government and other countries could not establish similar stations within China to communicate with Japan and Europe for 30 years. When the Zhili faction came to power, in February 1921, they signed a wireless contract with the American United Telegraph Company to build a station near Shanghai, and expanded the scale to establish branch stations in Hankou, Guangzhou, Beijing, and even Harbin in the Northeast. Japan protested, citing a 30-year patent. The United States said it was "Open Door" and Japan could not object. When the dispute was unresolved, the Zhili government (then Gu Weijun was the Foreign Minister) proposed two solutions for Japan to choose: 1. According to the principle of "equal opportunity," not favoring either side—that is, recognizing the legality of the United States establishing a radio station in China; 2. If Japan insisted on the contractual patent and refused to concede, then according to Article 9 of the contract, "the government may nationalize the radio station at any time within 30 years"—that is, Japan's rights could not exist (Note: "Eastern Miscellany" Volume 21, No. 3). The role of the United States in using its lackeys to fight against Japan can be seen from this.
    However, the development of the Second Zhili-Fengtian War was completely contrary to the wishes of the United States. When the United States and Britain supported the Zhili faction, Japan also joined forces with France as an assistant, vigorously supporting Zhang Zuolin in the North, and Sun Yat-sen was preparing for the Northern Expedition in the South (Note: See Cai Hesen, "What About the Northern Expedition? Resisting British Imperialism and Counter-Revolution?" in "The Guide," issue 83). A major division headed by Feng Yuxiang occurred within the Zhili faction. This internal and external attack from both the North and the South caused the Zhili faction to suffer a major defeat. As a result, Japan was not expelled, but a US-Japan equilibrium was re-established.
    In November 1924, the United States proposed holding an international conference in China, preparing to co-manage China with the Dawes Plan for co-managing Germany's economic lifeline, and in December, Japan proposed the "Post-War Conference" through Duan Qirui, which was a manifestation of the new US-Japan equilibrium (Note: "Eastern Miscellany" Volume 20, No. 12 reprinted "Bank Weekly" Jingru's article "On the Reform of the New Banking Consortium" quoted a telegram from a diplomat of the Beijing government, stating that "the agenda of the formal meeting of the new banking consortium in the United States includes the joint organization of the Chinese State Council and the establishment of a new banking consortium's financial supervisor in China, a disarmament committee, a joint railway management committee in China...etc." According to the timing, it seems to have been a few months before the Second Zhili-Fengtian War.) Although the "co-management" and "post-war" situation did not truly materialize due to the deep contradictions between the two sides, the United States and Japan were able to coexist temporarily and cooperate to deal with the Chinese people. This situation persisted until the eve of the Northern Expedition in 1926. For example, in May 1925, when a Japanese factory owner in Shanghai shot and killed the Chinese worker Gu Zhenghong, directly causing the "May 30th Movement," which marked the beginning of the Chinese People's Great Revolution, the United States stood completely with Britain and Japan. On the one hand, it added all of its Marine Corps in Shanghai to the British and Japanese troops to massacre unarmed Chinese masses, and its domestic and Chinese mouthpieces viciously slandered Chinese youth as "rioters" and "rebels." On the other hand, it released a poisonous arrow at the Soviet Union, saying that the movement was instigated by the Soviet Union. Suffering from the lack of any facts, they found a photo taken when Soviet Ambassador to Beijing Karakhan left Peking University, published it in the newspaper, and added this annotation: "Ambassador Karakhan's felt hat was respectfully held by students, which shows the degree of their intimacy," trying to use this as "evidence" that the Soviet Union was instigating the Chinese revolution. The New Republic, an organ of American radical aggressors, advocated "a joint force of 200,000 British, French, American, and Japanese troops should directly attack and occupy Beiping, and then seek ways to partition [China]." (Note: Transferred from Kong Xiang's "My Current Situation in China and American Public Opinion," published in "Eastern Miscellany" Volume 20, No. 17). This was precisely the action of temporary cooperation under the US-Japan equilibrium.
    In 1926, when the Northern Expedition of the Chinese People's Great Revolution began, the United States' tricks to compete for China changed again. At this time, Japan, due to the expansion of the Fengtian faction's territory, wanted to organize a Beijing government in six provinces and three special zones, creating a situation where it would at least monopolize the North. Britain, on the other hand, was independently supporting Wu Peifu's resurgence, hoping to consolidate its interests in the Yangtze River basin. In this situation, the United States decided not to take action itself first, but to let the Northern Expedition Army directly conflict with the British and Japanese forces. If the Zhili and Fengtian factions won, it would achieve the goal of eliminating the Chinese revolution by the hands of the British and Japanese, and it could also weaken the military strength of the Zhili and Fengtian factions through war, and then find ways to deal with Britain and Japan. If the revolutionary forces continued to develop northward, it could achieve the effect of using the revolutionary army to expel the British and Japanese forces, and then find an upper-level traitor or group from the revolutionary camp to betray the people and use it as its new lackey in China to dominate China. Therefore, in the storm of the Chinese Great Revolution, the United States was neither as panicked as Britain, nor did it secretly sabotage the revolution like Japan, but was very calm and even pretended to be "sympathetic." (Note: In July 1926, the Beijing government hoped that the United States and other countries would reopen the tariff conference. The Guangzhou government protested twice, stating that "the National Government regards the tariff conference as an initiative by the United States and relevant countries to intentionally turn the Chinese Customs into an opportunity to raise war expenses and foreign interference in China's revolutionary war." However, this was not the main policy of the United States at the time, and the US consul replied to the first protest that "I am paying close attention to this, and I declare that the United States is quite troubled by the fact that China does not have a central government..."

  　三　争夺中国霸权　（续十五）
    从一九二二年直奉第一次战争到一九二四年第二次战争，美国对直系军阀作了大规模投资，在财力上：美国运给直系军火，价值三百二十八万元，又步枪一万枝，子弹二百万发，机关枪二百五十挺，由美国人博治亚在洛阳替直系设飞行机械厂，又与直系齐＠元作“导淮”借款，筹措军费。在政治上：由美驻北京公使往保定和曹锟接洽“最高问题”，牵曹锟登场，哈丁（Ｗａｒｒｅｎ　Ｇ．Ｈａｒｄｉｎｇ）总统亲自教导曹锟进行贿选说：“美国银行团可助中国统一”。贿选进行时，美使独往“观礼”替曹撑腰，揭晓后，美使又首先称贺，表示“承认”，又使亲美派外交系顾维钧等予以扶持。在战争中，以美国船只供给直系往厦门、天津等地运送军火，又以炮舰在长沙帮助直系爪牙赵恒惕打退谭延＠。最后美国务卿许士赴伦敦与英国订立一个秘约，由英国在南方指使汇丰银行买办陈廉伯等以“商团军”驱逐孙中山出广东，美国在北方发动从江（江苏直系齐＠①元）浙（浙江与奉系有联系的卢永祥）战争开始的直奉战争，企图以此全面结束日本势力，建立一个美国直系“强有力的中央政府”。这是一九一七年美日争夺中国霸权以来，美国努力所达到的高潮。（注：以上见一九二二年七月及一九二四年九月十日中共中央第二、第三次对时局主张和一九二四年九月十八日向导一八期）高君宇江浙战争与外国帝国主义。
    此时美国通过直系工具，比日本抢走了更多的中国权利，例如一九一八年皖系掌权时，北京政府与日本三井洋行订立建筑北通州无线电台合同，规定日本有管理权，并在三十年内北京政府和其他各国俱不得在中国境内设立同样电台，以与日本及欧美通讯。迨直系当政，于一九二一年二月又与美国联合电报公司订立建筑于上海附近的无线电合同，并扩大规模在汉口、广州、北京、甚至东北的哈尔滨都建立分台。日本以有三十年专利，提出抗议。美国说是“门户开放”，日本不能反对。在争执不决时，直系政府（时顾维钧为外长）便提出两个办法由日本选择：一，照“机会均等”原则，不偏袒任何一方——即承认美国在华建立电台的权利为合法；二，日本必欲依合同专利不肯让步，则依合同第九款“政府于三十年内无论何时可将电台收归‘国有’”——即日本权利不能存在（注：东方杂志二一卷三号。）美国运用其走狗与日本斗争的作用，于此可见一班。
    但第二次直奉战争的发展，完全与美国愿望相反。当美国与英国支持直系时，日本亦联合法国作助手，既在北方大力扶植张作霖，又有孙中山在南方准备北伐（注：参看蔡和森北伐呢？抵抗英帝国主义及反革命呢？载向导，八三期。）直系内部更发生以冯玉祥为首的重大分化，这种南北内外夹击，使直系大败亏输。结果，不是日本被驱逐，而是美日均势重新形成。
    一九二四年十一月美国提议在中国召开国际会议，准备以共管德国经济命脉的道威斯计划共管中国，及十二月，日本由段祺瑞提议召开“善后会议”，便是新的美日均势的表现（注：东方杂志二○卷一二号转载银行周报静如论新银行团之改造一文引北京政府外交官的电报称，“新银行团在美正式会议之议题有共同组织中国国务院及设置新银行团在中国之财政总监督、裁兵委员会、共同管理中国铁路委员会……等项”，按其时间，似在第二次直奉战前数月。）虽因双方的深刻矛盾，“共管”与“善后”局面都没有真正实现，美日两国却因此得暂时相安，来合作对付中国人民，此种形势直至一九二六年北伐前夕仍然存在。如一九二五年五月间上海日本厂主枪杀中国工人顾正红，直接引起作为中国人民大革命开始的“五卅运动”时，美国完全与日英站在一起。一面把它在上海的海军陆战队扫数加入日英军队屠杀中国徒手群众，由它国内和在中国的喉舌恶骂中国青年为“暴徒”，“叛乱分子”；一面对苏联放出一枝毒箭，说这个运动是苏联所指使的。他们苦于没有任何事实，找了一张苏联驻北京大使加拉罕出北京大学时所摄相片，在报上刊出，加上这样的注释：“加拉罕大使之毡帽系由学生敬代持之，足见其亲热之程度”，想以此作为苏联指使中国革命的“证据”。美国激进侵略者的代言机关新共和周报就主张“以英、法、美、日联军二十万直攻北平而占据之，徐图瓜分办法”（注：转见孔襄我中国现状与美国舆论，载东方杂志二○卷一七号）。这正是美日均势下，暂时合作的行动。
    一九二六年中国人民大革命的北伐战争开始，美国争夺中国花样又有了变化，这时日本因奉系地盘扩大，想组织一个六省三特别区的北京政府，造成最少是独占北方的局面。英国则单独扶持吴佩孚再起，希望以此巩固长江流域利益。在此情况下，美国拿定主义，自己先不出手，让北伐军与英日势力直接冲突，如果直奉战胜，则达到借英日的手，消灭中国革命的目的，也可借战争把直奉军力削弱，然后另图对付英日办法。如果革命势力一直向北发展，则又可达到利用革命军驱逐英日势力的功效，然后从革命阵营中寻找一个上层叛卖分子或集团，使它背叛人民，作为自己在中国新的走狗来独霸中国。因之美国在中国大革命暴风雨中，既不象英国那样张皇失措，也没有日本那样对革命秘密破坏，而是很镇静，甚至装做“同情”的样子。（注：一九二六年七月，北京政府希望美国与各国重开关税会议，广州政府曾两次抗议，有“国民政府视关税会议为美国与有关系各国有意将中国海关变为筹战费及外人干涉中国革命战争机会之主动”，但此事非美当时主要政策，美领事对第一次抗议答复有云“对此甚为注意，并声明美国颇苦于中国未有中央政府……”，民国二十二年申报年鉴Ｇ四五——四六页。）
