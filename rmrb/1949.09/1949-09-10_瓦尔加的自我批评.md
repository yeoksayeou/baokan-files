　　Varga's Self-Criticism
    By E. Varga Translated by He Jiang
    (Original Title: Against Reformist Tendencies in Writings on Imperialism)
    As is well known, my book "Changes in Capitalist Economy as a Result of the Second World War" (Wu Qingyou's Chinese translation is "Changes in Post-War Capitalist Economy" - translator), and all other works published after the war by the former Institute of World Economy and World Politics (as the leader of this institute, I am responsible for these works), have been severely criticized in party newspapers and scientific discussions. These criticisms were necessary and correct. My mistake was that I did not immediately recognize the correctness of these criticisms, as other comrades did. However, admitting it later is still better than never admitting it.
    Unfortunately, the problem is not just that my book generally exposed errors, but the nature of these errors. It is difficult not to make mistakes in a book like this, which attempts for the first time to independently explore such a complex issue: the impact of the Second World War on the capitalist economy. Unfortunately—as the criticism correctly pointed out—these errors constitute an entire series of reformist tendencies, which even means definitely deviating from Lenin and Stalin's assessment of modern imperialism.
    Of course, the error of reformist tendencies also implies the error of cosmopolitanism, because it whitewashes capitalism.
    All reformist errors, as well as all damage to the clarity of Marxist-Leninist doctrine, are particularly dangerous in the current historical environment.
    The deepening of the general crisis of capitalism prompts the bourgeoisie to rely more stubbornly on reformists in the struggle against the working people, against communism, and against its fortress, the Soviet Union. In all bourgeois countries, there is close cooperation between the bourgeoisie and reformist traitors. Reformists serve the bourgeoisie at any time and never miss a day, and engage in acts of betraying the interests of the working people (attempts to split the World Federation of Trade Unions, advocating the "Marshall Plan" and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and slandering the Soviet Union, etc.).
    In countries like Britain, the Scandinavian countries, and Australia, reformists are "in power." This means that the bourgeoisie directly entrusts the traitors of the working class to safeguard its class rule and act as agents of its class interests (in some countries, they participate in coalition governments with bourgeois parties, and even cooperate with fascist workers' lackeys—as in Greece).
    In order to deceive the workers, the reformists declare: while they are "in power," they are turning the bourgeois rule into a tool of the working class and achieving socialism through the path of world reform without revolution. This dangerous counter-revolutionary deception can be exposed and liquidated by thoroughly upholding the Marxist-Leninist doctrine on the class nature of the bourgeois state—regardless of who leads its government: the bourgeoisie or "socialist" ministers.
    There is no doubt that all reformist errors regarding bourgeois rule contribute to the counter-revolutionary reformist deception in the working class, thus supporting the bourgeoisie; unfortunately, these errors occur in my book (although contrary to the author's wishes).
    The errors of reformist tendencies in my writings are particularly dangerous at present not only for the working people of capitalist countries, but also for the working people of people's democratic countries. In these countries, hundreds of thousands of social democratic workers and hundreds of left-wing social democratic leaders have individually joined the Communist Party or have collectively united with the Communist Party, and they sincerely want to become revolutionary communists. But this requires complete liberation from the reformist ideas in which they were educated, and requires transformation by principled Marxism-Leninism. For these people who have been educated in reformist ideas for many years, this is a difficult task; here, there is sometimes still the danger of reformist revival. In the struggle against reformist ideas, our fraternal parties need and expect the help of Soviet scientific workers. If errors of reformist tendencies occur in our work (as happened to me), then we will not only be unable to give any help to our fraternal parties, but will hinder their important work of transforming new party members—former social democrats.
    For this reason, I would also like to emphasize the following points:
    Openly reformist books do less damage in this tendency and have less harmful influence, while books like mine, in which the errors of reformist tendencies are more or less implicit, are therefore more difficult to discover and correct. (Note 1)
    The errors revealed by criticism in my work have such greater significance: these errors are mainly about the estimation of the role and nature of the current and modern bourgeois state.
    As is well known, the issue of the estimation of the bourgeois state has been one of the basic points of divergence between revolutionary Marxist Bolsheviks and counter-revolutionary reformists for half a century. Marx and Engels always and in all places: for example, in the "Critique of the Gotha Program," in the analysis of the Paris Commune, in "The Origin of the Family, Private Ownership, and the State," in "Anti-Dühring," etc., as in their letters, have emphasized that the bourgeois state is a tool of capitalist class rule and a tool for oppressing the working people. Reformists cover up, obliterate, and distort Marx and Engels' views on the state issue.
    Lenin struggled against reformism in one of his most brilliant and combative works, "State and Revolution." Lenin wrote in the preface, "When we begin to study Marx and Engels's doctrine on the state, we must discuss in particular detail the part of this doctrine that has been forgotten or suffered opportunistic distortion."
    Lenin and Stalin, starting from many principles of Marx and Engels, studied the doctrine on the state; they particularly emphasized that in the era of imperialism, the imperialist state is a tool used by the fascist oligarchy to plunder all working people.
    How could it happen that, deviating from the only correct doctrine on the state formulated by Lenin and Stalin and familiar to all Marxists, these errors of reformist tendencies occurred in my book on the issue of the role of the state in the wartime economy?
    As the criticism of me correctly proves, the basis and starting point of the above errors is the methodologically erroneous separation of economics and politics, and the attempt to deduce changes in the capitalist economy "purely economically" outside the connection between economics and politics.
    Departing from Marxist-Leninist dialectics, without making the necessary comprehensive study of the interrelationship of various phenomena of corresponding analysis, this inevitably leads to errors of reformist tendencies.
    Economics is the relationship between classes. In all class societies, class struggle is the basic content of politics. Politics is the concentrated expression of economics. If an attempt is made (as I and several other writers of the former Institute of World Economy and World Politics have tried) to analyze the capitalist economy "aside from politics," then this departure from the Marxist-Leninist method will inevitably (although contrary to the author's wishes) lead to errors of reformist tendencies.
    Methodologically sinfully setting aside the analysis of politics and class relations and class struggle inevitably leads to an incorrect estimation of the role of the state in the wartime economy, and to the erroneous assertion of the "decisive role of the state" in the wartime economy. If I study the role of the state in the capitalist wartime economy so erroneously "purely economically," then the erroneous conclusion will be reached that the decisive role in that country, which is not analyzed from a class standpoint, is not played by the financial oligarchy that rules the country.
    Replacing the Marxist-Leninist class analysis method with this superficial "purely economic" research method inevitably leads to the erroneous conclusion that for the needs of the war, the state is acting against the interests of various monopoly capitalists.
    When I referred to the bourgeois state, I pointed out:
    "Its intention to most appropriately utilize all the resources of the country for war purposes has often conflicted with the private interests of various capitalist enterprises, and with their interests in striving to obtain as much high profits as possible."
    The speeches in the discussion justly pointed out that this argument provided a theoretical basis for recognizing the supra-class nature of the bourgeois state.
    Needless to say, I am certainly far from denying the class nature of the bourgeois state. But there is no doubt that it is wrong to think that the characteristic of the modern state is "the organization of the bourgeoisie as a whole," rather than—as it should be thought—the state of the financial oligarchy, I admit this is wrong.
    The methodologically erroneous method has created errors of reformist tendencies, even though the narrative of the facts themselves is correct. I specifically state (pages 30-31) that the senior positions in the wartime economic management organs of the United States and Britain are everywhere occupied by representatives of monopoly capital. I wrote: "Big monopoly capital also maintained its decisive influence on the state's economic policy, especially on the activities of wartime economic institutions, during the war; big monopoly capital decisively participated in the leadership of wartime economic institutions, and in fact led them."
    However, correctly established facts, if they are cited without applying the Marxist-Leninist method and departing from the correct dialectical interrelationship, if they are not theoretically generalized, then they only have meaningless value from the point of view of scientific research. Facts of this kind should be raised as evidence according to the Marxist-Leninist theory of the state, proving that the combination of the state machine and the financial oligarchy further deepened during the war, in order to ensure the monopoly capital's super-profits during the war and in peacetime.
    The criticism of me also correctly pointed out other important errors of reformist tendencies in my book on the issue of the state. On page 318, it says: "In the future, the role of the state will still be greater than before the war. The issue of more or less participation in state management will constitute the main content of the political struggle between the two basic classes of capitalist society—the bourgeoisie and the proletariat. The deepening polarization of bourgeois society and the differentiation of bourgeois society into two opposing basic classes will increase the proportion of the proletariat."
    Any reformist would agree with these words. They were written under the impression of the fact that immediately after the end of the war in 1945, communists participated in the governments of most countries in Europe—not only in the people's democratic countries, but also in France, Italy, and Finland. They were written under the hope that after the Communist Parties of these countries became the backbone of the resistance movement against the fascist occupation forces and used their influence in the masses, they would be able to maintain their position in the government, expand themselves in the struggle against the bourgeoisie, and win state power.
    This line of thought ignored these decisive facts: the bourgeoisie still controlled the state machine; the machine of violence (the army, the police, the gendarmerie) remained intact. Once the Communists, after participating in the government of the bourgeois state, wanted to confront the bourgeoisie and resolutely defend the interests of the proletariat, they would be expelled from all bourgeois governments. This was still possible, even though the working people gave the Communists mass support, because the British and American occupying authorities, anticipating similar wars, had disarmed the resistance movement led by the Communists in France, Italy, etc., dissolved its military structure, and supported the reactionaries in the struggle against the Communists with their own troops.
    The people's democratic countries experienced a different process, where, with the support of the Soviet Union, the working people maintained the state's armed forces and power, and the representatives of the bourgeoisie, if they had lost the support of the people, had to withdraw from the government.
    The post-war events in Europe are a new and obvious proof of the correctness of the Marxist-Leninist theory of the state, according to which the issue of state power is the issue of the interrelationship of class forces, which can only be resolved in class struggle.
    It is very regrettable that errors of reformist tendencies also occurred in one of my essays written in 1947 for the 30th anniversary of the great socialist October Revolution.
    My essay said: "The bourgeoisie in Europe, the birthplace of capitalism, now themselves admit that the capitalist social system needs fundamental reform, and cannot but implement these measures: such as the nationalization of important production sectors, state regulation of the economy, and the planning of agriculture, etc."
    Of course, this argument is wrong. A part of the bourgeoisie, especially their lackeys of various kinds of reformists, said these words simply to deceive the workers, to fight against the Communist Party, and to oppose communist ideas. The more clever are the European capitalists, especially what their reformist lackeys verbally talk about, they talk about the necessity of "fundamentally reforming" capitalism in the direction of socialism. This is easy to understand. The capitalist economic system plunged Europe into two world wars within a generation, the war sacrificed the lives of millions of working people, it left hundreds of thousands of blind, disabled and orphans, it led to famine and epidemics, while at the same time, arms dealers became unbelievably rich. The war itself contained fascist barbarism, concentration camps, racial hatred, and the destruction of millions of innocent people. This social system shows to the masses more and more clearly day by day: it is already moving towards self-destruction, is thoroughly decadent, and is historically destined to be destroyed. It leads to mass unemployment and the long-term inability to fully operate the production machine. I pointed out at the end of my book:
    "This terrible fact remains unchanged: the world war period is the only time in the recent quarter-century that the unemployed in bourgeois countries can really find work. Only when millions of people are killing each other and other millions are making weapons of murder for it, can capitalist society give all workers a job."
    "This terrible fact also remains unchanged: the recent quarter of a century—when the means of production in the capitalist world have been fully utilized—is the year in which people have suffered the most terribly."
    Needless to say, of course, under these circumstances, it is rare for capitalists and defenders of capitalism to now openly speak for maintaining this social system, which is hated by the working people, as it is. Such speeches would bring workers into the communist camp more quickly. Therefore, they loudly call for the fundamental reform of capitalism, while actually using all means to maintain the social system of capitalist exploitation as it is. (Note 2)
    There is no doubt that not discussing all of this in connection with the sentences cited by the critics from my book is a serious mistake that serves reformism. Lenin said in the preface to "State and Revolution," "The struggle to liberate the laboring masses from the influence of the bourgeoisie, and especially from the bourgeoisie of imperialism, is impossible without a struggle against opportunistic prejudices about the 'state'."
    My incorrect argument on the characteristics of British nationalization also has this tendency. Needless to say, the nationalization of important industrial sectors is a further strengthening of state capitalism. Therefore, it is wrong to say: "Bourgeois nationalization also means progress towards a new type of democracy" ("World Economy and World Politics" No. 3, 1947, page 5).
    The mistake also stems from ignoring the fundamental difference between the nature of the current British state led by the Labour Party government and the nature of the people's democratic countries. The British state under the Labour Party is a bourgeois state, a state of monopoly capitalists, and the main task of this state is to ensure the class rule of the big bourgeoisie. Indeed, Shinwell and Laski are often allowed to make deceitful propaganda speeches in order to deceive workers into the reformist camp, but the army—the state's machine of violence—is in the hands of those trusted by the bourgeoisie and used against the working people. At the same time, the bourgeoisie rewards the worker aristocracy with the dregs of their monopoly capital's super-profits, and buys off the Labour Party bureaucrats who work in government agencies with high salaries (Note 3), and adopts tactics such as the recent use of small gifts to bribe some of these bureaucrats—all of these are tactics commonly used by the British bourgeoisie.
    How satisfied the British big capitalists are with the actions of the Labour Party government can be illustrated by the following words in the "radical" weekly "New Statesman and Nation" (February 26, 1949): "One day, a big manufacturer, in commenting on the political situation, said, 'Of course, we had difficulties after the war, and now the workers are working very well, everything is in good order. You know, I am a staunch conservative, and have been so in the past. But I can't even imagine what would happen if the Conservative Party were in power'" (the emphasis is added by me—E. Varga)
    In contrast, the people's democratic countries (referring to Eastern Europe—editor) are countries of the working people, who are carrying out the task of increasing the welfare of all working people and opposing the exploiting classes under the proletarian dictatorship. The armies and state machines of these countries are in the hands of those trusted by the working people and used against the exploiters.
    Under the class characteristics of the above-mentioned countries, British nationalization does not mean "progress towards a new type of democracy."
    The managers who lead the nationalized industrial sectors are still the former owners, the big monopoly capitalists.
    There can be no doubt: they will seek ways and means to create favorable conditions for their own un-nationalized enterprises in other industrial sectors at the expense of the interests of the nationalized enterprises, that is, at the expense of the interests of the state.
    Huge compensations not only guarantee the previous income of the owners of the nationalized enterprises; these owners are also insured against the consequences of the economic panic, which will strongly shake Britain in the near future. For them, economic panic is nothing to fear. Even in the case where the nationalized enterprise sector suffers heavy losses and the economic panic has caused many private enterprises to declare bankruptcy, their income can still be guaranteed at the expense of the interests of taxpayers—that is, the interests of the working people.
    Inconsistently applying the Marxist-Leninist theory of the state leads to errors and ambiguities in the study of colonial issues, especially to an incorrect estimation of the changes in the relationship between Britain and India.
    India's becoming two dominions is a compromise between the ruling classes of Britain and India. The Indian bourgeoisie, in close alliance with the feudal landlords, betrayed the Indian national liberation cause in order to maintain its class rule over the millions of workers and peasants in India within the British Empire. In order to maintain its capital and other economic positions in India, and to continue to participate in the exploitation of the Indian working people in the future, the British bourgeoisie abandoned direct rule over India with the support of the occupying forces.
    I made an incorrect estimate of the Anglo-Indian financial relationship in my book. I wrote: "India's transformation from a debtor country of Britain to a creditor country of Britain means a serious change in the economic relations between the two countries, and this change is beneficial to India. India's new financial situation was bought at the cost of significant sacrifices suffered by the Indian working people, and the living standards of the Indian working people have already been drastically reduced. In some provinces, such as Bengal, the people are really starving." (Page 222)
    Has India really become a creditor country of Britain? If we study this issue mechanically and in a bookkeeping manner, then, without a doubt, the answer is yes. Britain's debt to India, according to official estimates, is greater than the total amount of British investment in India. However, if we ask the question of who is exploiting whom, then it is very clear that the additional value that India should have received from Britain has not flowed into India, but on the contrary, despite the fact that India occupies the position of a creditor country, it still pays huge sums to Britain every year. This is easy to understand: Britain's needs for India (and Pakistan) are a kind of national asset that enjoys a preferential burden of non-payment and exclusively collects profits, while the capital that Britain invests in India is a preferential direct investment, and is extracting profits far exceeding the average standard on extremely high exploitation. In terms of capital amount, India is Britain's creditor country, but in terms of capital income, Britain is still India's exploiter even now.
    Of course, Britain's investment in India guarantees Britain's very strong economic and political position, and when, to what extent, and under what conditions Britain "reimburses" its debt to India is decided by Britain itself. The starting point of some of Britain's policies is: generally not to settle debts with India, on the pretext that this debt was burdened for the sake of defending it. Naturally, India cannot force Britain to settle, India cannot send its own fleet to bombard British ports, as Britain usually does to debtor countries that are overdue in payments. If Britain sometimes agrees to give India a sum of money each year to settle its debts (Note 4), that is mainly based on this point! A public refusal to pay would lead to a dangerous increase in the penetration of American capital into India and an increase in American influence in India.
    I admit these mistakes, and at the same time I want to point out: one cannot think that there is "absolutely no" change in Anglo-Indian relations. No matter how seriously we estimate Britain's existing economic, military, and political position in India (Britain still uses its preferential system in India and Pakistan, and both India and Pakistan have joined the Sterling Area), it is still a fact that India has changed from a colony occupied by British troops and managed by British officials to a semi-colony, to a dominion, in this semi-colony, the bourgeoisie, fearing the peasant and worker movement, dominate their own machine of violence in a way that betrays the liberation struggle by compromising with British imperialists. It is already possible to play tricks between Britain and the United States, and to use the divisions between British and American imperialists.
    In short, although one must never overestimate the significance of India's transformation from a colony into a dominion, this matter should still be studied as one of a series of events in the historical process of the decline and impending disintegration of the British Empire (Note 5) that is taking place before our eyes. The complete independence of India, which was shamefully betrayed by the Indian bourgeoisie for their class interests, will be realized in the recent historical future by the Indian working people under the leadership of the Indian working class, who will end the rule of the Indian landlords and bourgeoisie who are united with their British masters.

    Methodologically erroneously separating the analysis of economics from politics, non-dialectically dividing the role of the bourgeois state in the wartime economy into two chapters (discussing state adjustments of this kind in the first chapter of the book, and discussing unplannedness and anarchy in production that still exist separately from it in the second chapter, despite the adjustments), and setting aside the analysis of the political aspects of this issue, all of this creates the impression that I deny the role of the blind laws of capitalist development in the wartime economy, and recognize the existence of a wartime planned economy under capitalist conditions. But this was by no means my intention. I wrote on page 35 of my book: "...it is certainly absolutely incorrect to call wartime economic adjustment 'economic planning'..." However, in my entire discussion of the issue, there is a lack of necessary Marxist clarity.
    As often happens when one tries to defend one's own mistakes, I have redoubled my mistakes in the discussion by arguing that after the war "something similar to a special 'national plan' appeared in several capitalist countries". I should admit that all my arguments on the issue of "planning under capitalism" are a serious departure from my correct position in 1935, when at the Seventh Congress of the Communist International, I explained the essence of the reformists' deceptive bourgeois propaganda on "planning under capitalism" as follows: "The main reasons are: 1. the impossibility of solving the market problem, 2. the tendency to cover up the financial oligarchy's plundering of the state treasury, 3. the tendency to cover up the reorganization of the national economy for war needs, 4. the tendency to stop the revolutionary process of the working masses."
    There is no doubt that an even more resolute struggle should be waged against the false propaganda about "planned economy" under capitalism (Note 6), which is now being carried out by reformists in connection with the propaganda of the Marshall "Plan".
    　　　×　　　　　×　　　　　×　　　　　×
    It is absolutely wrong to regard the emergence of people's democratic countries merely as a political structure, and to transfer the analysis of it to the second part of my planned work, which is about politics. There is no doubt that the escape of these countries from the imperialist system is one of the important socio-economic consequences of the Second World War, which means the deepening of the general crisis of capitalism.
    The one-sided "purely economic" research method leads to an incorrect estimation of the significance and nature of these countries, and to an estimation such as this, under which it is asserted: "No matter how important and significant the emergence of the new type of economy in these countries is (this economy cannot be called capitalism in the original sense), the proportion of these countries in the entire capitalist world economy is still relatively small, and basically will not change the overall future of capitalist development for a while." (Page 291)
    This estimate is bankrupt and incorrect. It is wrong to study these countries as capitalist countries (although not "in the original sense"), because, without a doubt, they are in the process of rapidly moving towards the path of socialism. The assertion that state capitalism occupies the main position in these countries is incorrect (I have already admitted this in the discussion), and it is especially incorrect to estimate the significance of these countries as "relatively small" merely based on economic statistical considerations. The emergence of the people's democratic countries and their economic prosperity and rapid socialist development under the system of performing the tasks of the proletarian dictatorship on the basis of the Soviet Union's experience and all-round help, all of this has huge, principled significance. Adopting a non-dialectical, merely "economic" research method and forgetting Comrade Stalin's instruction on the need to follow the guideline that new things are also developing, this led me at that time into the path of making an erroneous estimation of the nature and significance of the people's democratic countries.
    Separating economics from politics also leads to various other errors; leading to studying the role of workers in the national economy one-sidedly merely as a factor of production and separate from class struggle, not attaching importance to the struggle between the two systems, and incorrectly believing that this struggle within the democratic camp "has temporarily stopped", incorrectly estimating the consequences of land reform in the people's democratic countries; I cannot detail all of these now.
    It is of great significance that, due to the incorrect research method of the issue, my book cannot even find a place to discuss the issue of the deepening of the general crisis of capitalism. This inevitably gives the reader the impression that the world war had no impact on the economic panic. Of course, it is impossible to study all the issues in one book, but not discussing the issue of the general crisis of capitalism is a serious mistake.
    　　　×　　　　　×　　　　　×　　　　　×
    There is no doubt that my belated recognition of the errors revealed by criticism has caused losses, it made our economists turn back to those problems that had already been liberated by Marxism-Leninism. What's worse: this gives the war instigators in the imperialist camp the possibility of spreading these lies, namely: I am a person who "inclines to the West," which means a counter-revolutionary, a traitor of the working class.
    Honestly admitting all the mistakes, thoroughly studying what the reasons are, in order to avoid making them again in the future, this is exactly the only correct attitude towards mistakes that Lenin considers for the Communist Party and for individual comrades.
    Lenin wrote in his theoretically profound, combative work "Left-Wing Communism: An Infantile Disorder":
    "What concerns individuals--with the appropriate modifications--can also be applied to politics and parties. It is not clever to be a person who doesn't make mistakes. There are no such people, and it is impossible to have them. It is clever to be a person who makes not very significant mistakes and is able to easily and quickly correct them."
    There is no doubt that I was not clever in this regard.
    　　　×　　　　　×　　　　　×　　　　　×
    The errors revealed in other works of the former Institute of World Economy and World Politics, which were written during the war, also belong to this category in principle. The authors of these works wrote under my leadership! I, as their leader, should bear full responsibility for these errors.
    Needless to say, I should certainly learn lessons for the future from the mistakes I have already made. As a simple continuation, the planned study of political issues in the second volume of my work is not realized now. If the economic changes during and after the war have not been determined, then writing an independent work on the politics of modern imperialism would still be methodologically wrong.
    Lenin wrote about Kautsky in his work "Imperialism and the Split in Socialism":
    "Kautsky's definition is completely fallacious in theory. ... By separating the politics of imperialism from the economics of imperialism, separating the political monopoly from the economic monopoly, Kautsky clears the way for his own vulgar bourgeois reformism..."
    In short, together with the second volume of my planned former work, I should write a new book on the economic and political problems of post-war imperialism, in which there are no more reformist errors that occurred in the book "Changes in Capitalist Economy as a Result of the Second World War".
    Note 1: It should be explained that after the Hungarian version of my work was published, a critical essay on my work was published in the theoretical organ of the Hungarian Working People's Party, the content of which was the same as the content of the critical essays published in our Party newspaper.
    Note 2: We would like to recall for this reason: Fascists also always engaged in "anti-capitalist" deceptive propaganda on the lips, and issued fallacies about "German socialism". Now it is generally difficult to distinguish between reformists (such as Moka) and fascists.
    Note 3: This situation can also be seen in the United States. The big capitalist newspaper "New Surich Report" (January 21, 1949) published an American communication entitled "New Gentlemen," in which we read:
    "In recent years, in the reception rooms of the 'White House' and in the reception rooms of various ministers, one can more and more often meet a new type of person--trade union leaders. In appearance, they are no different from ordinary American business figures. ...
    Now the income of trade union leaders is about the same as the income of ordinary American business people. This itself can explain their way of life. ...
    The idea of class struggle is still foreign to them. They are on the ground, but there are no ideals in their heads. Their thoughts are concentrated on the immediate problems that they are called upon to solve, they do not think about the ideas of the future. American trade union leaders believe that their responsibility for the bright future of 'his' industry and 'his' economy is becoming more and more important."
    These narratives clearly illustrate the complete separation of American trade union leaders from the workers and their collusion with the bourgeoisie. The leader of the Miners' Union, Lewis, receives an annual salary of $100,000. Until recently, the American president's salary was less than his.
    Note 4: The Indian Economic Journal is very complaining that British industry does not supply the machines and production tools ordered by Indian capitalists, and the price of these goods is paid by the Indian account in London.
    Note 5: British imperialism is being increasingly crowded out by American imperialism everywhere. Recently, Britain has been virtually crowded out of the Ruhr, Palestine, and Greece. The American plan for "aiding backward areas" is also aimed at strengthening the penetration of American capital into the colonies of European imperialists, primarily the colonies of British imperialists.
    Note 6: American monopoly capitalists in the United States advocate "free entrepreneurial enterprises," and require Western European countries to "plan" their economies for the benefit of American financial oligarchs.

　　瓦尔加的自我批评
    Ｅ·瓦尔加著  何疆译
    （原题：反对关于帝国主义的著作中的改良主义倾向）
    如所周知，我所著“作为第二次世界大战后果的资本主义经济的变化”（吴清友中译本译作“战后资本主义经济的变化”——译者）一书，以及前世界经济及世界政治研究所战后出版的所有其他著作（作为这个研究所领导者的我，应对这些著作负责），曾在党报上和科学讨论中受到严厉的批评。这些批评是必要的和正确的。我的错误是在于：我没有立即承认这些批评的正确性，象其他同志那样。可是，后来再承认究竟还比永远不承认要好些。
    不幸还不在于我这本书里一般地暴露出错误，而在于这种错误的性质。很难在这样一本书里不犯错误，它首次试图单独地探讨这样复杂的问题：即第二次世界大战对资本主义经济所产生的影响。不幸的是—正如批评正确地指出的—这些错误构成改良主义倾向错误的整个系列，它甚至意味着确定地脱离列宁斯大林对现代帝国主义的估计。
    当然，改良主义倾向的错误也意味着世界主义倾向的错误，因为它粉饰了资本主义。
    一切改良主义错误以及对马列主义学说的明确性所加的一切损害，在当前历史环境中是特别危险的。
    资本主义总危机的加深，促使资产阶级在对劳动人民、对共产主义及其堡垒苏联进行斗争愈加顽强地依持改良主义者。在一切资产阶级国家里，存在着资产阶级与改良主义叛徒之间的密切合作。改良主义者一天也不放过地随时为资产阶级服务，并从事叛卖劳动人民利益的行为（世界工联里的分裂企图，为“马歇尔计划”及北大西洋公约进行鼓动以及对苏联的诽谤等等）。
    在象英国，斯堪的纳维亚半岛国家及澳大利亚这样的国家里，改良主义者“当权”着。这就是说，资产阶级直接地委托工人阶级的叛徒来保障其阶级统治，并代理其阶级利益（在若干国家，他们与资产阶级政党一同参加联合政府，甚至与法西斯主义的工人走狗合作——如在希腊）。
    为了欺骗工人，改良主义者们宣称：他们一面“当权”着，同时正在把资产阶级统治变成工人阶级的工具，并通过世界改革的途径不经革命而达到社会主义。这种危险的反革命欺骗可以用彻底维护马列主义关于资产阶级国家——不管它的政府是由谁来领导：资产阶级抑或“社会党的”部长——的阶级性的学说的方法来加以揭穿和清算。
    毫无疑义，一切关于资产阶级统治的改良主义错误，都是助长工人阶级里的反革命的改良主义欺骗的，因而支持了资产阶级；很不幸，这些错误发生在我的书里（虽然与作者的愿望相违）。
    我的著作里的改良主义倾向错误，在目前不仅对于资本主义国家的劳动人民，而且对于人民民主国家的劳动人民都是特别危险的。这些国家里数以十万计的社会民主党的工人以及数以百计的左翼社会民主党领袖，已一个个地转入共产党，或者已经集体地与共产党联合，他们真诚地愿意成为革命的共产主义者。但是这需要完全地从他们所被教育的改良主义思想里解放出来，需要受原则的马列主义的改造。对于这些在改良主义思想里受过好多年教育的人们来说，这是件艰难的工作；在这里，有时还有改良主义复活的危险。在与改良主义思想进行斗争时，我们的兄弟党需要和期待着苏联科学工作者的帮助。如果我们的工作里发生改良主义倾向的错误（象我所发生的那样），那末，我们不但不能对我们的兄弟党给以任何帮助，反而妨碍了他们的改造新党员——前社会民主党员——的重要工作。
    为此，我还愿意强调指出如下诸点：
    公开的改良主义的书籍在这一倾向上所加的损害较小，其影响的为害也较小，而象我这样的书，其中改良主义倾向的错误是或多或少地隐含的，因之也就难于发见和纠正。（注一）
    我的著作里由于批评而揭发的错误具有如此更大的意义：即这些错误主要的是关于对当前及近代资产阶级国家的作用及性质的估计问题。
    如所周知，对资产阶级国家的估计问题，在这半世纪以来一直是革命的马克思主义布尔什维克党人与反革命的改良主义者间发生纷歧的基本点之一。马克思和恩格斯随时随地：譬如在“哥达纲领批判”里，在对巴黎公社的分析里，在“家族私有财产及国家的起源”里，在“反杜林论”里等等，正如他们的书信里一样，都曾强调指出资产阶级国家是资本家的阶级统治的工具，是压迫劳动人民的工具。改良主义者掩盖了、抹煞了、曲解了马克思和恩格斯在国家问题上的见解。
    列宁曾在其最辉煌的战斗的著作之一——“国家与革命”里对改良主义进行斗争。列宁在序言里写道，“我们在开头研究马克思及恩格斯关于国家的学说时，要特别详细地论述这学说中被人遗忘了或遭受机会主义曲解的那一部分”。
    列宁和斯大林从马克思和恩格斯的许多原理出发，研究关于国家的学说；他们特别着重指出：在帝国主义时代，帝国主义国家乃是法西斯寡头政权用以掠夺全体劳动人民的工具。
    怎么能发生这样的事：背离了列宁和斯大林所制订的、为一切马克思主义者所熟知的唯一正确的关于国家的学说，而竟然在我的书里对国家在战时经济中所起作用问题上发生这些改良主义倾向的错误呢？
    正如对我的批评所正确地证明的，上述错误的基础及出发点，乃是方法论上错误地把经济和政治分离，在经济与政治的联系之外，“纯经济地”推论资本主义经济底变化的企图。
    脱离了马列主义的辩证法，没有对应分析的各种现象的相互关系作必要的全面的研究，这不可避免地要导向改良主义倾向的错误。
    经济是各阶级间的关系。在一切阶级社会中，阶级斗争是政治的基本内容。政治是经济的集中表现。如果试图（我和前世界经济及世界政治研究所的若干其他著作家曾如此试图过）“撇开政治”而来分析资本主义经济，那末，这种脱离马列主义的方法不可避免地（尽管与作者的愿望相违）要导向改良主义倾向的错误。
    方法论上罪恶地撇开政治及阶级关系与阶级斗争的分析，不可避免地要导向对于国家在战时经济中的作用的不正确估计，要导向关于战时经济中“国家的决定作用”的错误论断。如果象我这样错误地“纯经济地”研究国家在资本主义战时经济中的作用，那末就要得出如此的错误结论：在不从阶级立场出发来分析的那个国家中，起着决定作用的不是统治该国的金融寡头。
    根据这种皮相的“纯经济的”研究方法，来替代马列主义阶级分析方法，不可避免地要得出如此的错误结论：即为了战争的需要，国家是在违背着各个垄断资本家的利益的。
    我在论及资产阶级国家时指出：
    “它想要最适当地利用全国一切资源于作战目的之意图，曾经常地与各个资本主义企业的私人利益，与他们力求获得尽可能多的高额利润的利害关系相冲突。”
    讨论中的发言公正地指出，这种论断提供了承认资产阶级国家的超阶级性质之理论根据。
    不待说，我当然远不致于否认资产阶级国家的阶级性。但毫无疑义，认为现代国家的特点是“资产阶级整体的组织”，而不是——象应该认为的那样——金融寡头的国家，我承认这是错误。
    原则上错误的方法论造成了改良主义倾向的错误，尽管事实本身的叙述是正确的。我具体地说明（第三○—三一页），美国和英国的战时经济管理机关里的高级职位，到处都是由垄断资本的代表人占据着。我写道：“大垄断资本在战争时期也保持其对于国家经济政策，尤其对于战时经济机构的活动起着具有决定作用的影响；大垄断资本具有决定作用地参加了战时经济机构的领导，在事实上领导着它们”。
    但是正确确立的事实，如果它们被引证时没有应用马列主义方法并离开正确的辩证的相互关系，如果它们在理论上不一般化，则从科学研究的观点看来就只有无意义的价值。诸如此类的事实应该根据马列主义的国家理论提出来作为证据，证明国家机器与金融寡头之间的结合在战争期间的更进一步加深，以保证垄断资本在战争时期以及和平时期的超额利润。
    对我的批评还正确的指出我的书里在国家问题上的其他重要的改良主义倾向的错误。在三一八页上说：“在将来，国家的作用仍然会比在战前更加大些。关于参加国家管理的多或少问题，将构成资本主义社会两基本阶级——资产阶级与无产阶级之间政治斗争的主要内容。资产阶级社会日益加深的极端化以及资产阶级社会向两个对立的基本阶级的分化，将增大无产阶级的比重。”
    任何改良主义者都会同意这几句话。它们是在这种事实的印象之下写出来的：即紧接着一九四五年战事结束之后，在欧洲大多数国家——不仅在人民民主国家，而且在法国、意大利及芬兰等国——共产党人参加了政府。它们是在这样的希望之下写出来的：即各该国的共产党人在成为反法西斯占领军的抵抗运动中的中坚并运用其在群众中的影响之后，就能够保持其在政府中的地位，在对资产阶级进行斗争中扩大自身，赢得国家政权。
    这种思想历程忽略了这些具有决定意义的事实：即资产阶级仍然支配着国家机器；暴力机器（军队、警察、宪兵）仍然原封不变。一旦共产党人在参加资产阶级国家的政府之后想要对抗资产阶级而坚决维护无产阶级利益的时候，他们就会从一切资产阶级政府中被逐出。虽然劳动人民给共产党人以群众性支持，但这仍是可能的，因为英美占领当局预料会发生类似的战争，业已解除法、意等国由共产党人领导的抵抗运动的武装，解散它的军事编制，并以英美占领当局自己的军队支持反动派对共产党人进行斗争。
    人民民主国家则经历着与此不同的过程，在那里，劳动人民在苏联支持之下保持了国家的武装和政权，而资产阶级的代表人，如果他们已丧失人民的支持的话，就要退出政府。
    欧洲战后的事情乃是马列主义国家理论的正确性的新的和明显的证明，按照马列主义的国家理论，国家政权问题是阶级力量的相互关系问题，它只能在阶级斗争中解决。
    很遗憾，改良主义倾向的错误还发生在我于一九四七年为伟大的社会主义十月革命三十周年而写的论文之一里面。
    我这篇论文里说：“资本主义发源地欧洲的资产阶级现在自己承认，资本主义社会制度需要根本改革，且不能不实行这些措施：诸如重要生产部门的国有化，国家对经济的管制以及农业的计划化等等”。
    当然，这种论点是错误的。一部分资产阶级，特别是他们的走狗各式各样的改良主义者所以说这些话，无非是为了欺骗工人，为了对共产党进行斗争，反对共产主义思想。更聪明的是欧洲的资本家，特别是他们的改良主义走狗的口头所谈，他们口谈朝着社会主义方向来对资本主义加以“根本改革”的必要性。这是容易懂得的。资本主义的经济制度使欧洲在一世代之内陷入两次世界大战，大战牺牲了数以百万计的劳动人民的生命，它留下了数以十万计的盲人，残废和孤儿，它导向饥馑和流行病，而与此同时，军火商却令人难以置信地暴富了。大战本身包含着法西斯野蛮行为，集中营，种族仇恨以及数以百万计的无辜人们的毁灭。这种社会制度一天一天更明白地向群众表明：它已在自趋灭亡，已在彻底腐朽，并且在历史上注定要归于毁灭。它导向群众性的失业以及生产机器长久的不能充分开动。我在我的书结尾中如此指出：
    “这种可怕的事实依然无变化：即世界大战时期是资产阶级国家里失业者在最近四分之一世纪内唯一真正能找到工作的时期。只有当数以百万计的人正在互相残杀而其他数以百万计的人则在为此制造杀人武器的时候，资本主义社会才能给一切工人以工作”。
    “这种可怕的事实也依然无变化：即最近的四分之一世纪——这时候资本主义世界生产工具被充分利用着——是人们最可怕地遭受痛苦的年份”。
    不待说，当然，在这种情况下，资本家以及资本主义的辩护人现在公开地为了原封不动地保持这种为劳动人民所痛恨的社会制度而讲话，是很少见了。这样的讲话会更快地将工人们带进共产主义阵营里去。因之，他们大声叫嚷资本主义的根本改革，而同时实际上则在运用一切手段，以图原封不动地保持资本主义剥削的社会制度。（注二）
    无疑不把这一切与批评者从我书里所引用的句段联系起来讨论，乃是重大的过失，是为改良主义服务的。列宁在“国家与革命”的序言里如此说，“为争取劳动群众从资产阶级的，特别是从帝国主义的资产阶级的影响之下解放出来的斗争，如果不对关于‘国家’的机会主义偏见进行斗争的话，是不可能实现的”。
    我对于英国国有化的特征所作的不正确论断，也具有这种倾向。不待说，重要产业部门的收归国有乃是国家资本主义的进一步加强。因之，这样说是不对的：即“资产阶级国有化也意味着朝向新型民主方向的进步”（“世界经济及世界政治”一九四七年第三号，第五页）。
    错误还由于忽视了以工党政府为首的目前英国国家的性质与人民民主国家的性质之间的原则上的区别。工党执政的英国的国家，是资产阶级的国家，是垄断资本家的国家，这个国家的主要任务乃在保证大资产阶级的阶级统治。的确，辛威尔和拉斯基时常被准许发表欺骗宣传的讲话，为了将工人骗入改良主义阵营，可是，军队——国家的暴力机器，则掌握在资产阶级所信赖的手里并用以对付劳动人民。同时资产阶级则对工人贵族赏以他们垄断资本超额利润的残渣，并用高额薪金收买在政府机关里任职的工党官僚（注三），以及采取象最近对其中若干官僚所用的手段——贿以小小的馈赠，这一切都是英国资产阶级所惯用的策略。
    工党政府的行为如何地令英国大资本家满意，可以用“激进的”周刊“新政治家和民族”（一九四九年二月二十六日）里如下几句话来说明：“有一天，一位大制造商在评论政局时说，‘当然，战后我们是有困难的，而现在工人已在很好地工作，一切井然有序。你们晓得，我是坚定的保守党人，过去也是如此。但是我甚至不敢想象：如果保守党执政的话，将会发生什么事情’”（附点是我加的——Ｅ·瓦尔加）
    相反的，人民民主国家（按指东欧—编者）是劳动人民的国家，他们执行着增进全体劳动人民福利，反对剥削阶级的无产阶级专政的任务。这些国家的军队和国家机器掌握在劳动人民所信赖的人的手里并用以对付剥削者。
    在上述国家的阶级特性之下，英国的国有化并不意味着“朝着新型民主方向的进步”。
    领导着国有化的产业部门的管理工作者，仍然还是以前的所有主，大垄断资本家。
    不能怀疑：他们要觅取途径和手段，以牺牲被收归国有的企业的利益，也就是牺牲国家的利益、来为其他产业部门里他们自己的未被收归国有的企业创设有利条件。
    巨额的赔偿不仅保证了被收归国有企业所有主的以前的收入额；这些所有主还被保了险，不受经济恐慌的结果之害，而这个经济恐慌将在不久的将来强烈地震撼英国。对他们来说，经济恐慌没有什么可怕。甚至在国有化的企业部门亏累巨重而经济恐慌已使许多私营企业宣告破产的情况下，他们的收入仍能因牺牲纳税人的利益——也就是劳动人民的利益——而得到保证。
    不一贯地运用马列主义的国家理论，导向在殖民地问题研究上的错误及模糊，尤其导向对英国与印度之间关系变化的错误估计。
    印度的变成两个自治领，是英国与印度两国统治阶级之间的妥协。与封建地主紧密联盟的印度资产阶级，背叛了印度民族解放事业，借以保持其在不列颠帝国之内对印度数以百万计底工人和农民群众的阶级统治。为了保持其资本及在印度的其他经济地位，为了在今后还参加对印度劳动人民的剥削，英国资产阶级乃放弃了在占领军支持之下对印度实行的直接统治。
    我在我的书里对英印财政关系作了不正确的估计。我写道：“印度从英国的债务国一变而为英国的债权国，乃意味着这两国经济关系的严重变化，而且这种变化是有利于印度的。印度这种新的财政状况是以印度劳动人民蒙受重大牺牲为代价而买来的，而印度劳动人民的生活水准业已剧烈地降低了。在若干省内，例如在孟加拉省内，人民已在真正地挨饿”。（第二二二页）
    印度是不是真正已变成英国的债权国呢？如果我们机械地、用簿记方式研究这个问题，那末，毫无疑义，答是的。英国对印度的负债，根据官方估计，比英国对印度的投资总额大。但是，如果我们提出谁剥削谁这个问题，那就很明显，印度在英国所应得的额外的价值并未流入印度，而相反地，尽管印度占有债权国的地位，但它仍然每年向英国付出巨额款项。这很容易了解：英国对印度（以及巴基斯坦）的需要，是一种享有优先权地不支付负担，而专收取利得的国家资产，同时英国投入印度的资本，乃是优先的直接投资，并且是在极其高度的剥削上榨取着远超于平均标准的利润。就资本数额来讲，印度是英国的债权国，但是就资本的收入来讲，英国现在也仍是印度的剥削者。
    当然，英国的对印投资保证了英国的很强有力的经济及政治地位，而且，什么时候，在什么程度上和在什么条件下英国向印度“偿还”其债务，是由英国自己来决定的。英国某些政策之出发，就是为了：一般地不向印度清偿债务，借口这笔债务是为了保卫它而负担的。自然，印度不能强制英国清偿，印度不能派出自己的舰队去轰击英国的港口，象英国往常对于逾期不付款的债务国所施加的行动那样。如果英国有时会答应向印度一年给予一笔款项以清偿其债务（注四）的话，那是主要从这一点出发！即公然的拒绝清偿会导向美国资本向印度的危险渗入的增大及美国在印度影响的增长。
    我承认我的这些错误，同时我要指出：不能认为英印关系“绝对没有任何”变化。无论我们如何严重地估计英国在印度现有的经济、军事及政治地位（英国还利用其在印度及巴基斯坦的优惠制，而且印巴两国都加入英镑集团），但这仍然是事实：印度已从一个由英国军队占领并由英国官员管理的殖民地变成半殖民地，变成自治领，在这个半殖民地里，惧怕农民和工人运动的、以与英国帝国主义者妥协的方式背叛了解放斗争的资产阶级支配着自己的暴力机器。它已经有可能在英美两国之间玩弄手腕，并利用英美两国帝国主义者之间的纷歧。
    总而言之，虽然决不能过分估计印度从殖民地变成自治领的意义，但对于这件事仍然应该作为在我们眼前所发生的不列颠帝国没落和行将解体的历史过程（注五）中一连串事件之一来研究。为印度的资产阶级由其阶级利益出发而可耻地叛卖了的印度的完全独立，在最近的历史将来，将由印度工人阶级领导下的印度劳动人民来实现，他们将了结与其英国恩主相联合的印度地主及资产阶级的统治。

    方法论上错误地把经济的分析与政治分开，非辩证地把资产阶级国家在战时经济中的作用分为两章（在该书第一章里论及诸如此类的国家调整，而在第二章里论及与它相分开的、尽管有调整而依然存在着的生产上的无计划性及无政府状态。）以及撇开这个问题的政治方面的分析，这一切造成如此的印象：即我否认了战时经济中资本主义发展的盲目法则的作用，并且承认了在资本主义条件之下战时计划经济的存在。但这决不是我的本意。我在我的书的第三十五页上写道：“……把战时的经济调整称为‘经济的计划化’……当然是绝对不正确的”。但是，在我对问题整个的论述中，欠缺必要的马克思主义的明确性。
    象要辩护自己的错误时通常要发生的情形那样，我在讨论的时候因如下的主张而更加倍了自己的错误：我认为战后“在若干资本主义国家内出现了一种类似特殊的‘国家计划’的东西”。我应该承认，我关于“资本主义之下的计划化”问题的一切论断，都是严重地撇离我在一九三五年时的正确立场，当时在共产主义国际第七次代表大会上，我是如此解释关于“资本主义之下的计划化”之改良主义者的欺骗性的资产阶级宣传的实质的：“主要的原因是：一、市场问题的不可能解决，二、掩护金融寡头掠夺国家财库之倾向，三、掩护为战争需要而改组国民经济之倾向，四、制止工人群众的革命进程之倾向”。
    不能怀疑，对与马歇尔“计划”的宣传相联系的、现在由改良主义者所进行的关于资本主义制下“计划经济”的虚伪宣传（注六），进行还更坚决的斗争，是应该的。
    　　　×　　　　　×　　　　　×　　　　　×
    将人民民主国家的产生仅仅当作一种政治构造来考察，并将对它的分析转到我所计划中的著作的，关于政治的第二部里去讨论，这是绝对错误的。毫无疑义，这些国家的摆脱帝国主义体系，乃是第二次世界大战的重要的社会经济后果之一，它意味着资本主义总危机的加深。
    片面的“纯经济的”研究方法，导向对这些国家的意义及性质的不正确估计，导向这样一种估计，在这种估计之下，竟断言：“不论这些国家里的新型经济的产生是如何重要和具有重大意义（不能把这种经济称为原来意义上的资本主义），但这些国家在资本主义整个世界经济中的比重仍比较地不大，并且在基本上一时也不会改变整个资本主义发展的总前途。”（第二九一页）。
    这种估计是破产了的和不正确的。把这些国家当作资本主义国家（尽管不是“在原来意义上”）来研究是不对的，因为，毫无疑义，它们是处在迅速向社会主义道路推移的过程中。认为在这些国家里国家资本主义占主要地位的主张是不对的（我已经在讨论中承认了这一点），尤其不对的是仅仅根据经济统计的考虑把这些国家的意义估计为“比较地不大”。人民民主国家的产生以及其在苏联的经验及各方面帮助的基础上，在执行着无产阶级专政任务的制度之下的经济繁荣及迅速的社会主义的发展，这一切都具有巨大的，原则性的意义。采取非辩证的仅仅“经济的”研究方法以及忘记斯大林同志关于必须遵着新的事物也是在发展之中这一方针的指示，这就使我当时陷入对人民民主国家的性质及意义加以错误估计的道路。
    把经济与政治分开还导向各种其他错误；导向片面地把工人在国民经济中的作用仅仅当作生产因素而与阶级斗争相分开来研究，对两种制度之间的斗争不加重视并且不正确地认为在民主阵营之内的这个斗争“已暂告停止”，不正确地估计在人民民主国家里土地改革的后果；对于这一些，我现在不能一一加以详述。
    具有巨大意义的是：由于对问题的不正确的研究方法，我的书里竟然找不到论及关于资本主义总危机的加深问题的地方。这不可避免地使读者得到如此印象：即世界大战对于经济恐慌没有产生影响。当然，在一本书里要研究一切问题是不可能的，但是没有论及资本主义总危机问题乃是严重的过失。

    毫无疑义，我对于因批评而揭发的错误的迟迟不承认，是造成了损失的，它使我们的经济学家又折回那些早已由马列主义加以解放的问题上去。更坏的是：这给予帝国主义阵营中的战争挑拨者以散布这些谎言的可能性，即：我是“倾向西方”的人，这就意味着是反革命者，工人阶级的叛徒。
    老实承认全部错误，透澈研究其原因何在，以避免在以后再犯，这正是列宁认为对于共产党以及对于个别同志来说唯一正确的对待错误的态度。
    列宁在他的理论上深刻的，战斗的著作“共产主义运动中的左派幼稚病”里写道：
    “论及个人的东西——加以适当的修改——也能适用于政治及政党。聪明的不是不犯错误的人。这样的人是没有的，也是不可能有的。聪明的是犯了不很重大的错误并且能够容易地和迅速地加以纠正的人”。
    毫无疑义，我在这一点上是做得不聪明的。
    　　　×　　　　　×　　　　　×　　　　　×
    在战争期间所写的前世界经济及世界政治研究所的其他著作中所揭发的错误，在原则上也是属于这一类的。这些著作的作者是在我的领导之下撰写的！我，作为他们的领导者，应负担这些错误的完全责任。
    不待说，我当然应该从已经犯了的错误中吸取将来的教训。作为简单的继续，作为我的著作第二卷的在计划中的对政治问题的研究，现在没有实现。如果对大战期间及大战以后的经济变化还没有加以断定的话，那末，撰写关于现代帝国主义政治的独立的著作，在方法上还会是错误的。
    列宁在其著作“帝国主义与社会主义的分裂”中论及考茨基时写道：
    “考茨基的定义，在理论上是完全谬误的。……考茨基把帝国主义的政治与帝国主义的经济分离，把政治上的垄断与经济上的垄断分离，借此为他自己的庸俗的资产阶级改良主义廓清道路……”。
    总之，与计划中的我的前著作的第二卷一起，我应该写一本新的另外一本关于战后帝国主义经济及政治问题的书籍，其中不再有“作为第二次世界大战后果的资本主义经济的变化”一书中所发生的改良主义错误。
    注一：应该说明，在我的著作的匈牙利文本发行后，在匈牙利劳动人民党中央理论机关刊物上曾发表过对于我的著作的批评论文，其中内容与我们党报上所发表的批评论文的内容是一样的。
    注二：我们愿意为此回忆：法西斯主义者在口头上也老是从事“反资本主义”的欺骗宣传，并发出关于“德意志社会主义”的谬论。现在一般地很难区分改良主义者（譬如莫卡）与法西斯主义者。
    注三：在美国也能看出这种情形。大资本家的报纸“新苏里支报”（一九四九年一月二十一日）登载题为“新绅士”的一篇美国通讯，我们在其中读到：
    “近几年来，在‘白宫’会客室和各部长会客室里，愈加经常地能遇见一种新型人物——工会领袖。在外表上，他们与美国普通的企业界人物没有区别。……
    现在工会领袖的收入大约与一般美国企业界人士的收入差不多。这本身也能说明他们的生活方式。……
    阶级斗争的思想对于他们仍然是生疏的。他们在脚踏地上，但是头脑里却没有什么理想。他们的思想是集中在他们被宠召去解决的那些眼前问题上，他们不思索关于将来的思想。美国的工会领袖认为自己对于‘他的’工业和‘他的’经济的美好前途的责任正在愈来愈重大”。
    这些叙述明白地说明了美国工会领袖的完全脱离工人而与资产阶级相勾结。矿工工会领导人路易斯每年得到薪金十万美元。在最近之前，美国总统所得的薪金还比他的少。
    注四：印度经济杂志很抱怨英国工业不供给印度资本家所定的机器及生产工具，这些货物的价金是由印度在伦敦的款帐来划付。
    注五：各地的英国帝国主义正在愈来愈多地被美国帝国主义所排挤。近来，英国实际上已被排挤出鲁尔、巴勒士坦、希腊等地。美国的“援助落后地区”计划也是旨在加强美国资本对欧洲帝国主义者的殖民地的渗入，首先是对英国帝国主义者的殖民地。
    注六：美国垄断资本家在美国主张“自由的企业家的企业”，要求西欧国家为了美国金融寡头的利益使其经济“计划化”。
