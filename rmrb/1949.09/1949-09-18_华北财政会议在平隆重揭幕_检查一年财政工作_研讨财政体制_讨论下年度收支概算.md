The North China Financial Conference Grandly Opens in Ping

Reviewing One Year of Financial Work, Discussing the Financial System, and Debating the Next Year's Revenue and Expenditure Budget

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] The Second North China Regional Financial Conference grandly opened in Ping on the 16th. Fifty-six leading cadres from the financial departments of various provinces and cities attended the conference. Democratic figures Huang Yanpei, Ma Yinchu, Zhang Naiqi, Qian Changzhao, Shen Zhiyuan, Qian Jiaju, Ai Zhicheng, and Fan Hong, among others, attended as guests. Lan Gongwu, Vice Chairman of the North China People's Government, personally attended to provide guidance. After the conference began, Rong Zihe, Minister of Finance, delivered the opening speech, saying: This financial conference is being held at a time when North China is completely liberated, national victory is accelerating, and the democratic coalition government is about to be established, and therefore has special and great significance. There are three issues to be resolved at this conference: First, we must review the financial work of North China over the past year and summarize the experiences and lessons learned in financial work. With the development of the war situation, we have moved from rural areas to cities in the past year, which is also a major shift in financial work. Because we are not familiar with cities, we will inevitably make some mistakes. However, these mistakes have been or are being corrected, and we believe that they will be gradually overcome. Second, we must discuss the financial system. We hope that everyone will provide more opinions and discuss and propose a preliminary plan for submission to the Central Financial and Economic Commission and the upcoming central government for reference. Third, we must discuss the North China's revenue and expenditure budget for next year. This is a major part of this conference. We hope that the participating representatives will calmly consider the overall national situation, plan for the people, and take into account the lives of the soldiers at the front, so as to balance the needs of the military and the people, and both public and private interests, and formulate the next year's financial budget for submission to the Central Financial and Economic Commission for decision.

　　　　Vice Chairman Lan's Instructions

　　We must closely link financial work with the development of the national economy.

Vice Chairman Lan said: Looking back at the financial work of North China over the past year, there have been great achievements. On the one hand, we supported the Huaihai, Pingjin, and Taiyuan campaigns and helped the southward army's war needs. At the same time, we have gradually established a relatively complete financial system, such as the treasury system, auditing, and accounting systems. In particular, the phenomenon of grain depot losses in various places has been significantly improved in some respects. We hope that our financial workers will not have the idea of ​​financial work for the sake of finance. We should overcome a purely financial point of view and further closely link financial work with the future development of the national economy, and formulate a complete set of financial regulations to support and stimulate the development of industry, agriculture, and commerce, rather than become an obstacle to development. For example, the current agricultural tax regulations are very fair and reasonable financial regulations, which are of great help to the development of the agricultural economy in the future.

　　　　Speeches by Guests Zhang Naiqi and Others

Next, guests of the conference, democratic figures Zhang Naiqi, Qian Jiaju, Ai Zhicheng, and Huang Yanpei, spoke successively. Zhang Naiqi said: Among the current financial regulations in the liberated areas, the current agricultural tax in North China is very detailed, thorough, fair, and reasonable. It is a model of tax law in New Democratic China and a standard for future legislation in the new China. I believe that in the near future, the industrial and commercial tax regulations in cities will also achieve the same achievements as the agricultural tax regulations. Finally, he expressed his optimism about the country's revenue and expenditure for the coming year. Judging from the great achievements of North China's finances, it is very likely that the country's revenue and expenditure for the coming year will reach near equilibrium, which will greatly help the transition from national liberation to peaceful economic construction. Qian Jiaju said: The finances of a New Democratic country are essentially different from the finances during the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang. Capitalist countries and the reactionary rulers of the Kuomintang always said that their financial income was "taken from the people" and "used for the people." This was just a deceptive statement, which was actually only used for the benefit of a few rulers. Only in socialist countries and New Democratic countries can we truly achieve the point of "taken from the people, used for the people." Then he said: China's historical financial income was mainly based on customs duties, salt taxes, and consolidated taxes, accounting for about 80% of total tax revenue, but the situation has changed today, and agricultural tax revenue accounts for an important part of the entire income. Therefore, I agree to classify agricultural taxes as central revenue. Ai Zhicheng then spoke, expressing his admiration for the great achievements made by the Chinese Communist Party in financial and economic work under very difficult circumstances in the past. He also suggested that the financial burden in the future should achieve an appropriate balance between farmers and urban people. Finally, Huang Yanpei spoke. In addition to expressing his admiration for the great achievements of financial work, he also hoped that the government would take into account the lives of salt farmers and not increase the burden on the poor people when formulating salt tax regulations in the future.　　　　　　　　　(Lin Hong)

　　华北财政会议在平隆重揭幕
    检查一年财政工作·研讨财政体制·讨论下年度收支概算
    【本报讯】华北全区第二届财政会议于十六日在平隆重揭幕，出席会议者有各省、市财政部门负责干部五十六人，到会来宾民主人士黄炎培、马寅初、章乃器、钱昌照、沈志远、千家驹、艾志诚、樊弘等十余人。华北人民政府蓝公武副主席亲临指导。会议开始后，财政部戎子和部长致开会词说：这次的财政会议是在华北全部解放，全国胜利加速到来和民主联合政府即将成立的时候召开的，因此有着特殊重大的意义。此次会议中要解决的问题有三：首先要作过去一年来华北财政工作的检查，总结出财政工作上的经验教训，随着战争形势的发展，一年来我们由农村进入城市，这在财政工作上，也是一个重大的转变。因为我们对城市不够熟习，难免会犯一些错误。但这些错误已经或正在改正，相信一定能够逐步克服的。其次，要研讨财政体制问题，希望大家多提供意见，讨论提出一个初步的方案来，以便提交中央财经委员会和即将成立的中央政府参考。第三，要讨论华北明年度的财政收支概算。这是此次会议的一个主要内容，希望与会代表心平气和的从全国范围出发，为老百姓打算，并要照顾到前方战士生活，做到军民兼顾、公私兼顾，拟定出明年度的财政概算，以便提交中央财委决定。
    　　　　蓝副主席指示
    　　要把财政工作和国民经济的发展密切联系起来
    蓝副主席说：回顾一年来华北的财政工作，是有很大成绩的。我们一方面支援了准海、平津、太原等战役和帮助了南下大军的战争需要。同时逐步建立起一套比较完整的财政制度，如金库制度、审计、会计制度等。特别是各地粮库的损失现象，已有若干显著改进。希望我们的财政工作者不要有为财政而财政的思想，应克服单纯财政观点，进一步把财政工作和今后国民经济的发展密切联系起来，制定一套完备的财政法规，使之能够扶助和刺激工、农、商业向前发展，而不要成为发展的障碍。例如现行的农业税则，就是很公平合理的财政法规，它对于今后农业经济的发展有很大帮助。
    　　　　来宾章乃器等发言
    接着大会来宾民主人士章乃器、千家驹、艾志诚、黄炎培相继发言。章乃器说：解放区现行的财政法规中，华北现行农业税则是很详细、周密、公平、合理的。它是新民主主义中国税法的榜样，是新中国今后立法的标本。我相信在不久的将来，都市中的工商业税则方面也会达到和农业税则同样的成就。最后，他表示对明年度国家的财政收支非常乐观，从华北财政的伟大成就来看，明年全国的财政收支很有达到接近平衡的可能，这对于配合全国解放转入和平的经济建设有很大帮助。千家驹说：新民主主义国家的财政与国民党反动统治时期的财政，有着本质上的不同。资本主义国家和国民党反动统治者，口口声声的说：他们的财政收入是“取之于民”“用之于民”的，这不过是一句骗人的话，实际上只是用在少数的统治者身上。只有在社会主义国家和新民主主义国家中才能真正做到“取之于民、用之于民”的地步。接着他说：中国历来的财政收入是以关税、盐税和统税为主，约占全部税收的百分之八十，但是今天的情况改变了，农业税收占整个收入的重要部分。因此，我同意把农业税划归中央收入。继由艾志诚讲话，他对中国共产党在过去十分艰苦的情形下，将财经工作作出了伟大成就表示敬佩。并建议今后的财政负担要作到农民和都市人民适当平衡。最后由黄炎培讲话，他除对财政工作的伟大成就表示钦佩外，并希望政府今后制订盐税法规时，要照顾到盐民的生活和不要加重贫苦人民的负担。　　　　　　　　　（林洪）
