　　Tang Guifen, an outstanding female worker in a Shanghai cotton mill, who persisted in underground struggle in Shanghai for a long time. She is a female flag-bearer in the Shanghai labor movement. She is tall and speaks in a firm and straightforward manner. She is thirty-one years old this year. She grew up in Shanghai with her father. She is currently the Minister of the Women Workers Department of the Shanghai Municipal Federation of Trade Unions and an executive member of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions. Her father also worked in a factory in Shanghai at first, an honest and straightforward worker who loved to stand up for what was right. During the "May 30th" Movement, he participated in the general strike. After the failure of the Great Revolution, he was fired from the factory. He then switched careers and started doing small business, opening small shops, and slowly accumulated some money, then opened a straw rope factory.

　　After the "August 13th" Incident, the family's house was burned down. Guifen and her family fled together. She was first introduced by a relative to work as a thread sorter in Shanghai Tongyi Yarn Factory, and then transferred to Yong'an No. 3 Factory.

　　In December of that year, a major strike occurred in the Yong'an factory, where workers demanded bonuses. Guifen participated in the workers' strike movement for the first time. She was assigned to do propaganda work. She did not go home for several days after work, but stayed at the factory to discuss issues. She felt very excited and happy. But in the end, more than forty workers were arrested, the strike movement failed, and she was also fired and became unemployed.

　　Soon, she transferred to Tongyi Yarn Factory to work again. In March 1939, a female employee named Mao came to their factory. She was very close to the workers and completely unlike the old staff in the factory in their attitude towards the female workers. The female workers also talked to her about everything. At this time, ten female workers organized a sisterhood, and Guifen also participated. Later, this female employee often came to chat with her, help her, and enlighten her, making her understand that only by organizing and fighting against Japanese imperialism could the female workers have hope in the future and avoid oppression. She also talked about the Communist Party and communism. Guifen was then filled with hatred for Japanese imperialism. She thought of her family and her deceased father. At the time, she was only twenty-one years old. Although she did not know what the Communist Party and communism were, her young heart was boiling. It was also at this time that she discovered that the lovely female employee was a female communist. She was extremely excited. The two enthusiastically talked for a long time. She received the help and education of the female employee and made progress day by day. While working in Tongyi Yarn Factory, she led their sisterhood to carry out life discussions and studies. Every night they studied for two hours in the factory's supplementary night school. On Sundays, six of the better partners in their sisterhood held a small book club together to discuss women's marriage issues and dark stories of society. Sometimes they also talked about current national affairs and read some briefings. They worked very hard.

　　In 1942, when the Pacific War broke out, the British businessman put up a sign and closed the Tongyi Yarn Factory. Following this, many factories opened by British and American imperialists were closed, and workers began to lose their jobs in large numbers. The environment became more difficult, but she was still left in Shanghai to continue the struggle. Soon, she managed to get into the China Textile No. 12 Factory (Dakang Yarn Factory). She arrived earlier and left later than everyone else every day. When she had free time, she also helped some of the younger female workers tailor clothes, so she had a very good relationship with everyone. But due to overwork, she began to cough up blood at this time. She was sick from February to May, lost her job, and had to stay at home helping people knit wool and work as a seamstress.

　　In 1944, she entered Tongxing Yarn Factory to work. Because of her good skills and ability to get close to the female workers, she was soon assigned to be a female worker foreman. The Japanese female instructors in the yarn factory often wanted to use her to manage some female workers, and Guifen took this opportunity to get close to the female workers. Once, the factory suppressed the workers' wages and did not pay them for four days. The workers' lives were so poor that they could no longer endure it. So everyone decided to strike and not start the machines. Guifen encouraged everyone's courage and insisted on fighting to the end with the factory. The next day, everyone insisted on striking. The Japanese in the factory came aggressively, wanting to arrest people. Guifen immediately called on all the foremen in the factory to protest to the factory and not allow them to arrest people, while demanding that the workers' wages and rice be paid immediately. Finally, the factory was afraid that the matter would get out of hand, so they agreed to their demands. The persistence of this strike was victorious and improved the workers' confidence in the struggle. Subsequently, there were two small struggles in the factory. In the struggles, Guifen always stood at the forefront and carried out propaganda and mobilization, which raised the workers' awareness.

　　After Japan surrendered, all the Japanese yarn factories in Shanghai stopped work and did not pay the workers' wages and severance pay. On the one hand, everyone was naturally dissatisfied, but on the other hand, because they had suffered extreme oppression from the Japanese for a long time, they were unusually excited and encouraged once they won. The workers of each factory automatically formed armed pickets to protect the factories. Subsequently, a large-scale struggle to eliminate traitors and resume work was launched. Then, on September 21st, each factory used the original factory organization to organize the workers and held a petition of 50,000 workers against hunger and unemployment. The workers' emotions were extremely high. It was not until November, when the workers in the Husi district were issued three months' severance pay, that each factory gradually resumed work. Guifen also returned to Tongyi Yarn Factory in this resumption of work.

　　Although it was said to be a victory at that time, prices in Shanghai were high and the workers' lives were extremely difficult. Some citizens' illusions about Chiang Kai-shek were also completely shattered. At this time, the workers' strength became stronger, laying the foundation for the establishment of a democratic workers' union. Guifen then led the female workers to carry out the work of organizing a trade union. On March 8, 1946, International Women's Day, 50,000 female workers in Shanghai participated in a large parade, putting forward the slogans of women's participation in politics and raising female workers' political awareness. Guifen was also one of the leaders of this large parade. After the "May 1st" Labor Day, the atmosphere of "anti-civil war" was very intense. More than 70 progressive people's organizations in Shanghai established a federation. She was elected as one of the directors, and therefore quickly attracted the attention of the Kuomintang secret agents, to the point that she was later forced to publish a statement in the newspaper to withdraw from the People's Organizations Federation. But at that time, the vast majority of people demanded peace and democracy and opposed the civil war. The democratic movement had reached a climax. During the "June 23rd" Movement, she also led the workers in the Husi district to participate in the anti-civil war and peace parade.

　　After the Xin Shen No. 9 Factory massacre occurred in February 1948, Guifen was also arrested in Shanghai on March 19th. Shortly after being released, because the Kuomintang reactionaries' oppression of the workers was increasing day by day, her work could no longer continue. Secret agents were constantly staring at her. On May 7th, she was forced to leave Shanghai, cross the river from northern Jiangsu, and enter the liberated area. In mid-August, she participated in the Sixth National Labor Congress in Harbin. She was the head of the Shanghai delegation and was elected as an executive member of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions. In November, she and Cai Chang and other representatives of Chinese women attended the World Women's Federation Conference held in Hungary. In March of this year, she also attended the First National Women's Congress held in Beiping. She is currently the Minister of the Women Workers Department of the Shanghai Municipal Federation of Trade Unions.

　　At the end of the conversation, she happily told the reporter that she was very excited to be able to represent various people's organizations in Shanghai to participate in the People's Political Consultative Conference. She smiled frankly and said to the reporter that her cultural level was not enough. This time, she must make good use of her time and step up her studies in order to better implement all the resolutions of the conference.

　　坚持上海地下斗争的
  　纱厂女工汤桂芬
    柏生
    汤桂芬，一个长期坚持在上海地下斗争的纱厂中的优秀女工。她是上海工运中的女旗手。个子高大，谈起话来坚实、爽朗。今年三十一岁了。从小跟着父亲生长在上海。她是现在上海市总工会女工部部长暨全国总工会的执委。父亲最初也是在上海一家工厂做工，一个正直爽快、爱打抱不平的工人。“五卅”时，他参加了大罢工，大革命失败后，他被工厂开除了。便转业开始做小买卖，开小店，慢慢的积下了几个钱，便开了一家稻草绳厂。
    “八、一三”事变后，家里房屋被烧，桂芬和家人一同逃难出来，先由亲戚介绍进入上海统益纱厂做个检坏纱女工，后又转到永安三厂做工。
    那年十二月里，永安厂里发生了一次工人为要求红利的大罢工。桂芬第一次参加了工人的罢工运动，她被分配做宣传工作，一连几天放工都不回去，在厂里讨论问题，她感到非常的兴奋和愉快。但最后她们被抓去了四十多个工人，罢工运动失败了，她也被开除而失业。
    不久，她又转到统益纱厂做工，一九三九年三月，她们厂里来了一位姓毛的女职员，她和工人非常亲近，完全不象厂里那些旧职员对女工们的态度。女工们也和她无所不谈。就在这个时候，她们有十个女工在一起组织了一个姊妹会，桂芬也参加了。以后，这女职员便常来找她闲谈，帮助他，启发她，使她明白了女工们只有组织起来和日本帝国主义斗争，将来才有希望，才能不受压迫；同时也讲到共产党和共产主义。桂芬那时充满了对日本帝国主义的仇恨，她想到家，想到死去的父亲，当时只有二十一岁的她，虽然不懂得什么叫做共产党，共产主义，但一颗年青的心沸腾起来了，也就在这时，她发现了那位可爱的女职员正是女共产党员，她兴奋极了，两人热情不拘的在一起长谈起来，她得到女职员的帮助与教育，一天比一天进步。她在统益纱厂里一面做工，一面领导她们的姊妹会展开生活讨论与学习。每天晚上她们在工厂的补习夜校里念两个钟头的书，星期日她们姊妹会中有六个比较好的伙伴便在一起举行一个小小的读书会，讨论妇女婚姻问题啊！社会黑暗的故事啊！有时也谈到当时的国家大事，读一些简报。工作干得非常有劲。
    一九四二年，太平洋战争起，英商挂牌把统益纱厂封起来了，跟着许多英美帝国主义开的工厂都封闭起来，工人开始大批的失业，环境更艰苦起来，但她仍被留在上海继续坚持斗争。不久，她设法考进了中纺十二厂（大康纱厂）。她每天比别人都早到晚退。有了闲，她还帮助一些比她小的女工们裁衣服，因此她和大家的关系也非常好。但因过度劳累，就在这时，她开始吐起血来。从二月一直病到五月，失业了，只好歇在家里帮助人家织毛活，和做女裁缝。
    一九四四年她进入同兴纱厂做工，因为技术好，又能接近女工，不久她便被派做一个女工班长。纱厂的日本女指导员常常想利用她管理一些女工，而桂芬也正好借此接近女工们。有一次厂方压下了工人的工资过了四天还没发，工人生活穷苦得实在都不能再忍受下去了，于是大家决定了要罢工，不开机车，桂芬鼓励大家的勇气，与厂方坚持斗争到底。第二天大家果然都坚持罢工了，厂里的日本人气势汹汹的来了，要抓人，桂芬立刻号召了厂里所有的工头向厂方抗议，不许抓人，同时要求马上发下工人薪资和米。最后厂方终于怕事情闹大不好收拾，便答应了她们的要求。这次罢工的坚持得到了胜利，并且提高了工人的斗争信心。接着厂里又发生过两次小的斗争，在斗争中，桂芬总是站在最前沿，并进行宣传鼓动，提高了工人的觉悟。
    日本投降后，上海所有的日本纱厂都停了工，也没有给工人们发工资和遣散费。大家一方面自然不满，但一方面因久受日本人的压迫，痛苦已极，一旦胜利，都异常欢欣鼓舞，各厂工人都自动组成了武装纠察，保护工厂。随后又展开了肃奸复工大斗争，接着，九月二十一日各工厂利用原厂机构，把工人组织起来，举行了五万工人的反饥饿反失业大请愿，工人情绪极高。直到十一月沪西区工人发下三个月的遣散费，各工厂方陆续复了工。桂芬也在此次复工中又回到了统益纱厂。
    当时虽说胜利，但上海物价高涨，工人生活极苦，有些市民对蒋介石的幻想也完全破碎。这时工人的力量更加壮大，打下了建立民主工人工会的基础。桂芬乃领导女工进行组织工会的工作。一九四六年三月八日国际妇女节，上海五万女工参加大游行，提出了妇女参政，提高女工政治认识的口号。当时桂芬也是这次大游行的领导者之一。“五、一”劳动节后，“反内战”的空气非常激烈，上海七十几个进步人民团体成立了联合会，她被选作理事之一，因此很快的引起了国民党特务的注意，以至后来强迫她登报脱离人民团体联合会。但当时广大的人民要求着和平民主；反对内战，民主运动已达到了高潮。“六、二三”运动中，她又领导沪西区工人参加了反内战争和平大游行。
    一九四八年二月申新九厂惨案发生后，在三月十九日，桂芬也在上海被捕。不久放出后，因当时国民党反动派对工人的压迫日益加甚，她的工作不能再继续展开，特务们经常盯着她。五月七号她被迫离沪，从苏北过江，进入解放区。八月中，她参加了哈尔滨第六届全国劳动大会，她是上海代表团的团长，并当选为全国总工会执委。十一月与蔡畅等代表中国妇女出席在匈牙利召开的世界妇联大会。今年三月她又出席了在北平召开的全国第一次妇代大会。她现任上海市总工会女工部部长。
    谈话最后，她愉快地告诉记者：她这次能代表上海各人民团体参加人民政协会议，她感到非常的兴奋。她爽朗的笑着向记者说：她的文化程度还不够，这次她一定好好把握时间，加紧学习，以便更好的执行大会的一切决议。
