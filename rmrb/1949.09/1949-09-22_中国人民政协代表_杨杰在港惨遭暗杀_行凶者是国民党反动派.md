Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 21st: General Yang Jie, representative of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and Central Executive Committee member of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, was assassinated by Kuomintang reactionaries at his residence in Hong Kong at 10:30 PM on the 19th and died. The Kuomintang Central News Agency published this news on the 20th, but concealed the well-known fact that the perpetrators were Kuomintang reactionaries. General Yang Jie was 59 years old, a native of Dali, Yunnan. He served as a member of the Kuomintang Central Executive Committee and Education Director of the Kuomintang Army University. From 1938 to 1940, he served as the Kuomintang government's ambassador to the Soviet Union. After returning to China, he began to oppose Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary policies. After General Yang Jie was approved as a representative to the People's Political Consultative Conference, he was unable to come to Beiping in time because he went to Kunming to carry out the People's Peaceful Movement in Yunnan. Because the People's Peaceful Movement in Yunnan was suppressed by the reactionary head of Yunnan, Lu Han, General Yang Jie recently left Kunming and returned to Hong Kong, where he suffered the long-prepared poisonous hands of the reactionaries.

  　杨杰在港惨遭暗杀
  　行凶者是国民党反动派
    【新华社北平二十一日电】中国人民政治协商会议代表、中国国民党革命委员会中央执行委员杨杰将军，十九日夜十时半在香港寓所被国民党反动派暗杀逝世。国民党中央社二十日发表了这个消息，但隐瞒了行凶者是国民党反动派这个众所周知的事实。杨杰将军五十九岁，云南大理人，曾任国民党中央执行委员和国民党陆军大学教育长，一九三八年至一九四○年任国民党政府驻苏联大使，回国后就开始反对蒋介石反动政策的活动。杨杰将军被通过为人民政协代表后，因为去昆明进行云南的人民和平运动，未能及时来平。由于云南的人民和平运动被云南的反动头子卢汉所镇压，杨杰将军最近离开昆明回到香港，在那里遭受了反动派准备已久的毒手。
