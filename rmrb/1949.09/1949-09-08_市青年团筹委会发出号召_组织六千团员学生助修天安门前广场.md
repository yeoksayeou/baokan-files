The Municipal Youth League Preparatory Committee Issues a Call
　　Organizing Six Thousand League Members and Students to Help Repair Tiananmen Square

[This newspaper reported] The Municipal New Democratic Youth League will enthusiastically participate in the construction project to open up Tiananmen Square with their half-day of voluntary labor. It is estimated that 6,000 young students and league members will participate. The Municipal Youth League Preparatory Committee has issued a call to all youth league members in the city. The full text is as follows:

"Comrades, Youth League members of the city: On August 31st, the People's Daily published the news that Tiananmen Square would be opened, and the vast number of young people and Youth League members in the city were very excited. We are in a stage where the construction of the entire China has begun, and the people of the whole country, especially the people in the rear, must be mobilized to work hard for the construction of the new China. We, the Youth League members, should work harder to promote the new spirit of patriotism, and give play to the positive and shock role of youth in the construction of the new China. We must learn from the brilliant example of the Soviet Communist Youth League members in the construction of the motherland. We must participate in labor with unparalleled enthusiasm, promote the construction enthusiasm of the masses, and save expenses for our government and people. This work is an excellent exercise for the youth themselves. We must exercise our revolutionary stand and labor concept in the specific labor of building the motherland.

Young friends of the city! Youth League members of the city! Let us work together, mobilize, and complete the glorious task of the youth happily and conscientiously!"

[Another news item] The Preparatory Committee of the Youth League in Beiping City has consulted with the主管方面 of this project, and the Construction Bureau has also fully agreed with this proposal, welcoming the youth of Ping City to participate in the work of opening up the square, and has appointed a special person to be responsible for completing various preparations. The Municipal Youth League Preparatory Committee has now consulted with the Construction Bureau and decided to mobilize 6,000 middle school and university students for half-day labor this Saturday (September 9th) afternoon to fill 309 pits in the square, with 20 people in a group, and each group filling one pit. Each group has six tools: one bamboo basket, two picks, and three shovels. All staff members are divided into six teams, with 1,000 people in each team. The Construction Bureau, the Municipal Youth League Preparatory Committee, and the district teams jointly organize a headquarters to uniformly command the labor of 6,000 people. In addition, comrades from the Public Security Bureau will come to help control traffic.
