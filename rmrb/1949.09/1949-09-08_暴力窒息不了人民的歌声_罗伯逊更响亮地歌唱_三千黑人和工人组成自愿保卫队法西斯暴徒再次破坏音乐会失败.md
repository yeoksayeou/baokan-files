Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 7th. TASS, New York, September 5th: Paul Robeson sang before at least 25,000 listeners in Peekskill on September 4th. Approximately 3,000 Black people, White people, young union members, progressives, and veterans formed a volunteer worker defense force, standing shoulder to shoulder around the open-air concert venue to protect Robeson from any possible fascist violence. The venue was one mile away from the location where fascists attempted to lynch Robeson on the night of August 27th. Despite large numbers of fascist thugs standing on the sidewalks of the road leading to the concert venue, shouting threatening words, hundreds of cars and buses continuously carried listeners from New York and its vicinity to the concert. Behind the volunteer defense force's "wall of people," men, women, and children found places on the grass, waiting for the concert to begin. The concert was effectively a demonstration to protest attempts to stifle the voice of this beloved progressive American hero.

At 6:00 PM, the master of ceremonies—the famous American anti-fascist writer Howard Fast—mounted the stage. The audience cheered enthusiastically for Fast. Fast suggested continuing the concert that was interrupted last week by un-American thugs. Fast then introduced the young Protestant pastor, Dahl. Dahl's opening prayer said: "We will not be intimidated or subdued. We say to the fascists: 'We will continue the people's struggle for freedom until we achieve victory. We are here to demonstrate our unity and strength, to defend the ideals of freedom and peace for all.'"

Then, Robeson took the stage amidst enthusiastic cheers and applause from the audience. The cheering lasted for ten minutes. Robeson offered a brief word of thanks, and then sang many songs, including "The Song of the Warsaw Ghetto," the Black spiritual "Let My People Go," and several Russian and French folk songs. Reactionaries did not cease their efforts to disrupt the concert. A police department propeller plane, surrounded by four or five apparently private planes, continuously circled low over the heads of the audience, their engine noise attempting to drown out Robeson's singing. Outside the concert venue, on the road, several small groups of hooligans blew horns and noisily banged on drums, attempting to achieve the same goal. They loitered back and forth in front of the concert venue entrance for about an hour. But this failed to interrupt the concert.

The police did not provide protection to the concert attendees when fascist thugs, separated by the road, threw stones attempting to reach the worker guards and shouted intimidating words. Because the attempts to disrupt and stop the concert failed, the fascist hooligans became enraged and began attacking audience members as they left the venue to go home. Several thugs threw stones at the first few cars leaving the venue. Other groups of fascist thugs gathered at other locations on the access roads, overturning several cars, throwing rocks at buses, and injuring several passengers.

At least fifty audience members are now receiving treatment at Peekskill Hospital due to attacks by thugs, including the leader of the Fur and Leather Workers Union of the CIO, Ben Gold, one of the twelve American Communist leaders currently "on trial" in Foley Square. But the thugs were unable to injure their main target of anger—Robeson—and completely failed to achieve their attempt to prevent Robeson from singing in Peekskill.

　　暴力窒息不了人民的歌声
  　罗伯逊更响亮地歌唱
    三千黑人和工人组成自愿保卫队法西斯暴徒再次破坏音乐会失败
    【新华社北平七日电】塔斯社纽约五日讯：九月四日，保罗·罗伯逊于毕克斯吉尔在至少两万五千听众之前唱歌。约三千名黑人、白人、青年工会人员、进步分子和退伍军人，组成工人志愿保卫队，肩并肩地围住露天音乐会场，保护罗伯逊免于遭受任何可能的法西斯暴力行动。会场距八月二十七日夜法西斯分子企图对罗伯逊施以私刑的地点有一哩路。尽管大批法西斯暴徒站在通往音乐会会场的道路的人行道上，喊着威胁的语句，数百辆汽车与公共汽车仍络绎不绝地载着听众，自纽约及其附近前往音乐会。在志愿保卫队的“人墙”后面，男人、女人和孩子们在草地上找到位置，等待着音乐会开始。音乐会实际上就是一个示威，以抗议企图窒息这位人所敬爱的进步美国的英雄的声音。
    在下午六时，司仪——著名的美国反法西斯作家法斯特登上讲台。听众向法斯特热烈欢呼。法斯特建议继续上周被非美国的暴徒们所打断的音乐会。法斯特继而介绍年青的新教牧师达尔。达尔的开幕祷词说：“我们不会被吓倒和压服，我们向法西斯分子说：‘我们将继续进行争自由的人民斗争，直到我们获得胜利为止。我们到这里来表明我们的团结和力量，来保卫一切人都有自由与和平的理想”。
    接着，罗伯逊在听众的热烈欢呼和鼓掌声中登台。欢呼历时十分钟之久。罗伯逊致简短的谢词，然后唱了许多歌曲，包括“华沙犹太人区之歌”，黑人圣歌“让我的人民走”，及数支俄罗斯与法兰西民歌。反动派并未停止打散音乐会的努力。一架警察局的螺旋推进飞机周围环绕着四五架显然是私人的飞机，不断地在听众的头上低低地盘旋，它们的马达声企图淹没罗伯逊的歌声，在音乐会会场外面的路上，几小群流氓吹着喇叭，吵闹地敲着鼓，企图达到同一目的。他们在音乐会会场入口前面来回徘徊约一小时之久。但这未能使音乐会中断。
    当那些隔着道路投掷石头企图到达工人卫队身边的法西斯暴徒们喊出恫吓的语句时，警察并未给音乐会参加者以保护。由于打断和阻止音乐会的企图失败，法西斯流氓恼羞成怒，遂开始在听众离开会场回家时攻击听众，数名暴徒向头数辆离开会场的汽车投石头。其他几批法西斯暴徒则聚集在各条通路的其他地点，推翻数辆汽车，向公共汽车投石块，击伤数名乘客。
    现在，至少有五十名听众由于遭到暴徒的攻击而在毕克斯吉尔医院就医，其中包括产联皮毛工人工会领袖，现在福莱广场“受审”的十二名美共领袖之一鲍达希。但暴徒却没有能伤着他们愤怒的主要目标——罗伯逊，并且完全未能实现他们的要使罗伯逊不能在毕克斯吉尔唱歌的企图。
