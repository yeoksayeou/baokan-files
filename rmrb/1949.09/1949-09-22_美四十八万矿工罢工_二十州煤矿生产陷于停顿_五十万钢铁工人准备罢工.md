Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 21st: Washington dispatch: The United Mine Workers of America's 480,000 coal miners went on a large-scale strike on the 19th, demanding the restoration of pensions and welfare benefits. Their slogan is: "No pension, no work." According to a Reuters dispatch on the 20th, the strike has now brought coal production in twenty states to a standstill.

At the same time, the long-brewing strike by the United Steelworkers of America (CIO), involving 500,000 workers, demanding increased wages, was repeatedly postponed under pressure from the Truman Investigation Committee through numerous negotiations between labor and management. However, due to the arrogant and unreasonable attitude of the capitalists, the steelworkers are also preparing to strike "this weekend" (UPI).

According to a report by the Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union, this coal miners' strike will strengthen the will of other workers to fight for legitimate demands. At the same time, this strike and the steelworkers' strike, which is poised to erupt on September 25, are bringing to the surface the issue of the entire future development of the American labor movement. When CIO President Murray and other senior leaders abandoned early progressive policies to support the Marshall Plan and Wall Street's foreign policy, inevitably, they were required to betray domestic workers on major issues such as wages, working hours, and social benefits. Steel occupies a pivotal position in the American labor landscape. If steelworkers win fruits, workers in other large industries will also strive for a fourth post-war wage increase. Because the steelworkers' strike will expose right-wing labor leaders like Truman and Murray and accelerate the process of the working masses disillusionment with the Truman government's pretense of caring for workers' interests, right-wing labor leadership organs are eager to avoid the strike.

　　美四十八万矿工罢工
  　二十州煤矿生产陷于停顿
    五十万钢铁工人准备罢工
    【新华社北平二十一日电】华盛顿讯：美国矿工工会联合会四十八万煤矿工人，于十九日起举行大罢工，要求恢复养老金与福利津贴，他们的口号是：“没有养老金就不工作。”据路透社二十日电，罢工现已使二十州的煤矿生产陷于停顿。
    与此同时，产联联合钢铁工人工会五十万工人酝酿已久的要求增加工资的罢工，虽然在杜鲁门调查委员会的压力下，经劳资双方多次谈判而一度延期，但由于资方态度蛮横无理，钢铁工人亦准备于“本周末实行罢工”（合众社）。
    据电通社评称：这次煤矿工人罢工将加强其他工人为正当要求而斗争的意志。同时这一罢工和势将在九月二十五日爆发的钢铁工人罢工，正在使关系美国劳工运动整个未来发展的问题表面化。当产联主席莫莱及其他高级领袖放弃早年的进步政策而支持马歇尔计划及华尔街的外交政策时，不可避免地，他们被要求在工资、工时及社会津贴等重大问题上出卖国内工人。钢铁在美国劳动场所中占有枢纽地位。如果钢铁工人赢得果实，其他大工业的工人也会力争战后第四度增加工资。由于钢铁工人罢工会揭露杜鲁门及莫莱之流的右翼劳工领袖，并加速工人群众对杜鲁门政府照顾工人利益之幻想的破灭过程，因此，右翼劳工领导机关正渴望使罢工得以避免。
