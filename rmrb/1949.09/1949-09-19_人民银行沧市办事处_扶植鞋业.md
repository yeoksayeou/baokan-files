　　People's Bank of Cang City Office
  　Supports the Shoe Industry
    [Cang City News] In order to develop Cang City's industry, especially industries that cannot be replaced by large machines and have development prospects, and to expand its reproduction and solve the difficulty of capital turnover, so that it will no longer be suspended, the People's Bank of Cang City Office has begun to determine the shoe industry as the focus of support. Support is provided through three loan methods: ordering goods, discounting in kind, and credit loans. A total of 1,757,000 yuan was loaned to sixteen households, including 1,100 pairs of shoes ordered, accounting for 554,000 yuan, accounting for 31.54% of the loan amount. 1,600 pairs of shoes were discounted, accounting for 900,300 yuan, accounting for 51.3% of the loan amount. Credit loans amounted to 300,000 yuan, accounting for 17.07% of the loan amount. This not only solved the difficulty of capital turnover, but also solved the work and living problems of the workers.
    In the past, Cang City's shoe industry had small capital and could not open up sales channels. After the loan, it was continuously transported to Tianjin for sale. At the same time, merchants from Tianjin, as well as merchants from Changchun and Shenyang in Northeast China, also came to Cang to purchase shoes. In mid-July alone, more than 2,000 pairs of shoes could be sold to Tianjin every day. As a result, the shoes had sales channels and the quality was also improved. Some shoe companies increased the number of workers and formally formed shoe worker production groups. For example, the Gongxing Cooperative increased the number of workers by 38, added three machines (for making shoe uppers), and installed three electric lights to prepare for working at night.
    The cooperative is now preparing to absorb members and incorporate scattered workers outside the factory into the factory. At the same time, the cooperative shares are not limited in number and will expand operations and carry out production in a planned manner. The bank office is preparing to give strong support to develop the production of Cang City's shoe industry.　　　　　　　　　(People's Bank of China, Cang City Office, Wang Jiurong, Wang Lanting)

　　人民银行沧市办事处
  　扶植鞋业
    【沧市讯】人民银行沧市办事处为了发展沧市工业，尤其是大机器不能代替，而又有发展前途的工业，为了扩大其再生产，解决资金周转困难，使其不再停工，始确定鞋业为扶持重点，通过订货、折实、信贷三种贷款方式予以扶持，计十六户共贷出款一百七十五万七千元，其中订鞋一千一百双，为五十五万四千元，占贷款数百分之三一·五四。折鞋一千六百双，为九十万零三千元，占放款数百分之五一·三。信贷三十万元，占贷款数百分之十七·○七。这样不仅解决了资金周转困难，又解决了工人的工作及生活问题。
    在过去沧市鞋业因资本小，打不开销路，经贷款后源源运往天津销售，同时天津的行贩，以及东北长春、沈阳的行贩，也相继来沧购鞋，仅七月中旬每天即能向津销鞋二千余双。这样一来鞋有了销路，质量也提高，有的鞋业增加了工人，且正式组成了鞋工生产组，如公兴合作社即增加工人三十八名，机器（作鞋帮的）三盘，并置电灯三个，准备夜间作工。
    现该社正在准备吸收社员，将厂外散工吸收入厂，同时社股也不拘数目，将扩大经营，有计划地进行生产，银行办事处准备予以大力扶持，以发展沧市鞋业生产。　　　　　　　　　（中国人民银行沧市办事处王九容、王兰亭）
