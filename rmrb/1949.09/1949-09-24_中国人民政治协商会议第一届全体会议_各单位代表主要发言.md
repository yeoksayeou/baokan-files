The Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) held its first plenary session, showcasing unprecedented unity among the Chinese people, marking the beginning of the people's self-governance, and heralding a bright future for the new China. We express our gratitude to the Chinese Communist Party for its over two decades of arduous struggle and correct leadership, to the People's Liberation Army for its heroic battles, to the entire nation for its long-term struggle against reactionary forces, and to all democratic parties, people's organizations, and patriotic democrats for their collective efforts. Together, we have overthrown the reactionary rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, and we are now embarking on the path to establish a new China that aligns with the people's aspirations. This is a moment of shared joy not only for the representatives present but for all the people of China.

Over the past three months, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the representatives of the CPPCC Preparatory Committee have worked together to complete the preparatory work for the CPPCC, including drafting the "Constitution of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference," the "Constitution of the Central People's Government," and the "Common Program." The main task of this conference is to discuss and adopt these three documents, thereby establishing the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, which is the unanimous hope of the entire nation, and implementing the Common Program. On behalf of the Chinese Nationalist Revolutionary Committee, I solemnly declare that we fully endorse the drafts submitted by the CPPCC Preparatory Committee to this conference. The basic spirit and entire content of these drafts are the goals that the Chinese people have been striving for over the past century, and they are fully in line with the revolutionary ideals of our party's founder, Dr. Sun Yat-sen.

The new China we aim to build is a New Democratic Republic of China, where the people transition from being oppressed to becoming the masters of a new society and a new nation. In this new nation, the political power is in the hands of the people, and the rights of reactionaries who act against the interests of the state and the people—those representing the interests of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism—are revoked. This is the united front of the working class, peasantry, petty bourgeoisie, and national bourgeoisie, with the worker-peasant alliance as the foundation and the working class as the leader, implementing people's democratic dictatorship. The revolutionary experiences accumulated by the Chinese people over several decades have proven that without following the path of this four-class alliance to implement people's democratic dictatorship, the New Democratic Republic will have no chance of establishment and consolidation. Dr. Sun Yat-sen once pointed out: "All individuals and groups that genuinely oppose imperialism shall enjoy all freedoms and rights; while those who betray the nation and serve imperialism and feudal warlords, whether as groups or individuals, shall not enjoy these freedoms and rights." Extending this principle, the republic that Dr. Sun wanted to establish and the People's Democratic Republic of China that we aim to establish today are consistent in spirit.

Currently, the world presents two distinct paths before the Chinese people. One is the path of a few oppressing the many, invading other nations, provoking wars, and threatening peace, leading to decline, represented by the United States-led imperialism. The other is the path of no oppression or invasion, opposing war, maintaining world peace, and promoting human happiness, represented by the international united front for peace and democracy led by the Soviet Union. Where will the Chinese people go? Dr. Sun Yat-sen, with his forty years of experience, instructed us: "We must unite with the nations of the world that treat us as equals and strive together." In his will to the Soviet Union, he said: "I hope that the Kuomintang, in completing its historic task of liberating China and other invaded countries from the imperialist system, will work together with you." The interests of the Chinese people are aligned with those of the socialist countries, the people of new democratic countries, and the oppressed and enslaved nations. To defeat our common enemy, to consolidate and build our new state, and to ensure that China transitions through the new democratic stage to socialism and ultimately to world unity, we must stand firmly on the side of the peace and democracy front led by the Soviet Union in the international arena. There is no second or third path; there is only one path.

The old democratic political system was essentially the dictatorship of a few capitalists; especially in the era of imperialism, the parliaments of old democratic countries were controlled by a few financial magnates. In our new democratic state, to truly reflect the will of the people and effectively serve the broad masses, the government's organization must be based on the principle of democratic centralism. Dr. Sun Yat-sen once pointed out: "Parliamentary politics often become tools of oppression against the common people." Through our accumulated experience over the past twenty years, we believe that the organs through which the people exercise state power must, on the one hand, truly represent the people, and on the other hand, have sufficient authority to implement national policies. The principle of democratic centralism combines the strengths of both. Moreover, in consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship and launching unprecedented large-scale construction in politics, economy, national defense, and culture and education, a political system based on the principle of democratic centralism should be the excellent system we adopt.

The economic construction of New China lies in the comprehensive transformation of the national economy, turning China from a backward agricultural country into a modern industrial power, and ensuring its development towards a higher stage of socialist economy. Therefore, it is necessary to abolish all privileges of imperialist countries in China, nationalize bureaucratic capital, gradually transform feudal and semi-feudal land ownership into peasant land ownership, protect state public property and cooperative property, protect the economic interests and private property of workers, peasants, petty bourgeoisie, and national bourgeoisie, and develop new democratic economy, steadily transforming an agricultural country into an industrial power. The fundamental policy of economic construction is to achieve the goal of developing production and prospering the economy through the policy of "balancing public and private interests, benefiting labor and capital, mutual aid between urban and rural areas, and exchange between domestic and foreign sectors." This is consistent in spirit with Dr. Sun Yat-sen's proposals of "developing industry and commerce," "implementing land to the tiller," and "regulating private capital."

The culture and education of New China should be in line with the policies of consolidating people's democratic dictatorship and developing the national economy. Therefore, the culture and education of New China should be new democratic, that is, national, scientific, and mass-oriented. Its main tasks are to raise the cultural level of the people, cultivate talents for national construction, and eliminate feudal, comprador, and fascist ideologies, developing ideologies that serve the people. Dr. Sun Yat-sen once said: "People receiving education should have equal opportunities." He also said: "Modern human thought emphasizes seeking happiness for all." This is consistent in spirit with the provisions on national cultural and educational policies in the Common Program of the CPPCC.

In summary, the Chinese Nationalist Revolutionary Committee fully endorses the three draft laws to be discussed and adopted at this conference, namely, the "Draft Constitution of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference," the "Draft Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference," and the "Draft Constitution of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China." We believe that these drafts can fully reflect the will of the Chinese people. We not only express our sincere support but also firmly believe that all democratic parties, people's organizations, and patriotic democrats, as well as the masses of the Chinese people, will unanimously express their support. This conference will surely successfully complete its tasks. However, this is only the first step in a long march. In the arduous work of building New China in the future, we must further consolidate the four-class alliance under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, follow the blueprint formulated by this conference—the Common Program—and press ahead with unyielding efforts, overcoming all difficulties!

**Huang Kesheng, Representative of the Fourth Field Army of the People's Liberation Army from the Huazhong Liberation Area**

I speak on behalf of the representatives from the Huazhong area and the Fourth Field Army:

We are filled with boundless excitement to participate in this conference because we see that the ideals and struggles of the Chinese people over the years are beginning to be realized through this conference. The representatives present are so broad and active, and the unity and democratic spirit they exhibit set a great and excellent precedent for the entire nation.

The three documents proposed by the Preparatory Committee (the Constitution of the CPPCC, the Constitution of the Government, and the Common Program) have been repeatedly discussed by our delegation and unanimously agreed to be three great historical documents. They are the current Great Charter of the Chinese people, a concentrated expression of the will of the entire nation, and they clearly outline the guidelines for future political, military, economic, and cultural construction, enabling us to steadily build an independent, democratic, peaceful, unified, and prosperous New China. We unanimously support these three documents and are willing to strive for their implementation.

The Huazhong area is currently the base for advancing south and west. We, the Fourth Field Army, will resolutely fight to completely annihilate the remaining reactionary forces in South China and liberate the entire South China. Our people in the rear will immediately mobilize to wholeheartedly support the war, ensuring its early conclusion and the early start of national construction. The Huazhong area is a newly liberated region, an area that has been under enemy rule for a long time and suffered severe destruction. Bandits, local tyrants, and remnants of the Kuomintang reactionaries are the main obstacles to the rapid establishment of revolutionary order. Therefore, it is necessary to mobilize the entire area's military and civilians to eliminate bandits and suppress local tyrants, creating the prerequisites for restoring and developing production, preventing natural disasters, and carrying out social reforms. These two points are the urgent tasks for the military and civilians of the Huazhong area to implement the conference resolutions.

We wish the conference a great success, and we will resolutely carry out the conference resolutions among the people. We firmly believe that the Central People's Government emerging from this conference will be able to lead the entire nation to completely smash the desperate struggles of imperialism, feudal forces, bureaucratic capital, and the Kuomintang reactionaries, to carry the revolutionary war to the end, to quickly complete the unification of the nation, and to achieve great victories in construction!

Long live the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference!
Long live the People's Republic of China!
Long live the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao!

**Liu Bocheng, Chief Representative of the Second Field Army of the People's Liberation Army**

The Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, a great gathering of the united Chinese people, is held in Beijing, the ancient capital, at a time when the People's Liberation War has triumphed over the Kuomintang reactionary government backed by the full might of American imperialism. This conference is to discuss the Common Program and establish a People's Democratic Republic of China and the Central People's Government. This is a great beginning in the history of New China, a glorious achievement created by the revolutionary creativity of the Chinese people. I, on behalf of all the soldiers of the Second Field Army of the People's Liberation Army, express my unbounded joy and loyal support.

The People's Liberation Army is a people's army led by the working class, fighting against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, and it has been tested in twenty-two years of struggle. This army, which has been able to complete the task of defeating the enemy in the past, will certainly be able to, under the leadership of its own Central People's Government, strictly follow government orders, implement military systems, complete the final victory of the liberation war, liberate all Chinese territory, enhance itself, consolidate national defense, and safeguard the peaceful construction of the people.

We, the Second Field Army, are currently fighting alongside the national field armies to carry out the task of liberating Southwest and South China. I guarantee to the conference that we will certainly completely annihilate the remaining enemy forces in Southwest and South China, consolidate national defense, and jointly safeguard the victorious progress of the construction of New China, living up to the expectations of the conference.

Finally, we shout:

Long live the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference!
Long live the People's Republic of China!
Long live the Central People's Government!
Long live the great leader of the Chinese people, Comrade Mao Zedong!

**Fuyi, Special Invited Representative**

The long-awaited Political Consultative Conference has finally opened. This is truly a national event, a people's event, and a historic event that marks an era in Chinese history, and it is particularly worthy of celebration. I took the fastest train from Suiyuan to attend the conference and to learn from Chairman Mao and all the representatives at the conference.

Today, I feel very ashamed to attend the conference because, before the peaceful liberation of Beijing, I was an important leader of the reactionaries. At that time, I could not see the direction of the people's will and continued to fight against the Liberation Army. It was not until the end of the Northeast campaign that I realized the mistake of the pacification policy and recognized the correctness of the Communist Party's leadership. The Communist Party of China and the People's Liberation Army have grown from small to large, developing so rapidly, which is a manifestation of the people's will. Since I realized my mistakes, I have dared to admit them bravely, immediately turned around, and followed the people's will to achieve the peaceful liberation of Beijing, breaking away from the reactionaries, and joining the people's side. Although the peaceful liberation of Beijing helped the revolution's progress, and although I did my best to preserve the ancient city with thousands of years of cultural accumulation, the lives and property of millions of hardworking people, and all the buildings that could become the capital of the people, I still feel that I should be responsible for the past internal war of reaction. I also request to be punished for the crime of war. The people have forgiven me today, and Chairman Mao's policy of leniency not only does not pursue past mistakes but also allows me to follow Chairman Mao, follow the representatives of the Communist Party of China, follow the representatives of the People's Liberation Army, follow the representatives of various democratic parties and democratic personages, and participate in the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. I am truly ashamed, honored, and filled with boundless excitement.

The Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference is held under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, which has fought hard and been tempered through countless trials. It is held under the personal chairmanship of Chairman Mao. The participating units and representatives include democratic progressives from all strata, parties, and ethnic groups, as well as scientists, artists, and all the best people. These representatives are the lighthouses of the people and the concentrated expression of the people's will. However, such a conference would never have been possible under the rule of the reactionary government. Under the rule of the reactionary government, the people attending the conference today would only be persecuted and massacred because they dared to speak out for the people, going against the majority. It was only when the Liberation Army had basically defeated the reactionaries and was about to completely eliminate the remaining reactionary forces that we could hold such a conference representing the people's will. This is an unprecedented true democracy in Chinese history and an unprecedented great unity of the Chinese people.

The task of this conference, as stated by Chairman Mao in his opening speech, is to formulate the Constitution of the CPPCC, the Constitution of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, the Common Program of the CPPCC, to elect the National Committee of the CPPCC and the Central People's Government Committee, to formulate the national flag and emblem, and to decide the location of the capital and the name of the ship. This is a sacred and solemn task. I believe that under the personal leadership of Chairman Mao, the representatives will surely complete this task successfully.

The drafts prepared by the Preparatory Committee, although I have only conducted preliminary research, I feel that they are all in line with the will and wishes of the people, especially the Common Program, from the preamble to the political structure, military system, economic policy, cultural and educational policy, ethnic policy, and diplomatic policy, are all formulated based on the characteristics of Chinese society, the needs of the people, and the goals of the Chinese revolution, with no empty talk and no hypocrisy. The People's Democratic United Front guarantees the implementation of these policies, and the implementation of these policies also guarantees the inevitable victory of the People's Democratic United Front.

Today, we declare to the world: the Chinese people have stood up. With the convening of the CPPCC, the People's Republic of China will also be established in glory, and imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries, feudal forces, and the bureaucratic bourgeoisie have failed. Although these reactionary remnants will not accept defeat, the trend of the times and the will of the people are with us. All their tricks and schemes will fail in the face of the people and will be in vain. Just as in the recent glorious uprising of the military and people of Suiyuan, the reactionaries tried to divide, incite, deceive, and bribe, attempting to obstruct and sabotage. The reactionaries said that the "International Volunteer Army" was organized, and the "Japanese Air Force Volunteer Corps" was organized. These shameless propaganda are a great insult to the military and people who have fought against Japan. The military and people of Suiyuan are tempered and will not be deceived. On the contrary, the shameless propaganda has increased our hatred for the reactionaries and our determination to join the people's side. When I returned to Suiyuan, Chiang Kai-shek gave me a "cordial" telegram, saying that my trip from Beijing to Suiyuan was like his trip from Xi'an to Nanjing after the Xi'an Incident. He said that after he returned to Nanjing, due to a moment of hesitation, he made a great mistake that led to the current danger. Therefore, he wanted me to learn from his lesson and not make a mistake that would harm the country and the subordinates. However, I firmly rejected him and returned to Beijing to attend the CPPCC conference. I believe that thousands and thousands of patriotic Kuomintang military and political personnel with conscience will join the people's side. The reactionaries cannot destroy or obstruct.

Representatives, let us, together with the people of the entire nation, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, grasp the weapon of people's democratic dictatorship, unite with our international friends, and create a wave of economic construction, a wave of cultural construction, one wave after another, to build a prosperous and thriving People's Republic of China. Under the banner of Mao Zedong, I shout:

Unite the people of the entire nation!
Unite international friends!
Long live the People's Republic of China!
Long live Chairman Mao and General Zhu!

**Cheng Fangwu, Chief Representative of the Education Workers**

We, seventeen representatives of education workers, have carefully discussed the two constitutions and the Common Program. We unanimously and fully support these three documents of great historical significance in building a new China.

The political power of the People's Democratic Dictatorship of China is the victory fruit of the Chinese people's long-term arduous struggle. Our Common Program most completely embodies the long-term aspirations of the vast majority of the Chinese people. In the past, Chinese educators have suffered long-term suppression and oppression under the anti-people reactionary regime, and the education cause could not be carried out, and personal talents could not be contributed. The night was so long, and the struggle was so cruel. Today, every educator personally feels that only the political power of the People's Democratic Dictatorship and such a program are what the Chinese people need and are in line with our common aspirations. We have been looking forward to this for many years, and today our struggle has achieved glorious results. We fully agree with the general guidelines and various specific policies for building a new country as stipulated in the Common Program and the two constitutions.

In the past, Chinese education has been long controlled by imperialism, feudal forces, and bureaucratic capital, with anti-people educational policies. It used feudal, comprador, and fascist ideologies to poison young students and the masses, while the educational policies were always detached or isolated from the needs of the people. The reactionary regime's reactionary educational policies and wrong educational methods were only for the reactionary interests of a few people, completely contrary to the needs of the Chinese people. Only in the areas led by the Communist Party of China, new democratic education has been implemented early, accumulating some experience, which has become the basis for our development of new democratic education.

The educational policies of New China must be new democratic, that is, national, scientific, and mass-oriented. Only in this way can it meet the needs of the broad masses of China. We must raise the cultural level of the entire nation so that they can all become active builders of a new democratic society. We must cultivate millions of builders for New China. We must eliminate feudal, comprador, and fascist ideologies so that the masses can completely free themselves from the influence of reactionary ideologies. Our educational work must also permeate the ideology of serving the people, which should be our only correct educational ideology.

The educational methods of New China must be consistent with theory and practice. Our educational work must follow this principle.

We fully agree with the guidelines, tasks, and methods stipulated in the Common Program.

We also fully agree with the emphasis on educational work stipulated in the Common Program, that is, to carry out universal education in a planned and step-by-step manner, strengthen secondary and higher education, pay attention to vocational education, strengthen part-time education for workers, and in-service education for cadres, and provide revolutionary political education to young intellectuals and old intellectuals. This is necessary and appropriate today.

In addition, the Common Program stipulates "to reform the old education system, content, and teaching methods in a planned and step-by-step manner," which we believe is also completely correct.

The construction of New China is a great project and a long-term task. New democratic education should become one of the powerful tools for new democratic construction. This is also a process. We must, based on the specific situation of China, reform the old education in a planned and step-by-step manner. Our task is heavy, and we must work together, unite all cultural and educational workers in the country, and cooperate closely with all sectors and organizations to advance together. We already have the political power of the People's Democratic Dictatorship and the Common Program. We will surely, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, Chairman Mao, and the soon-to-be-established Central People's Government, resolutely strive for the realization of this program.

**Tao Menghe, Special Invited Representative**

I represent the specially invited units of educators and scientists to speak at this unprecedented, united, and solemn grand conference of the Chinese people.

Firstly, we should thank the Chinese Communist Party for its twenty-eight years of unremitting efforts. Without the Communist Party of China, there would be no today. We especially should thank our people's leader, Chairman Mao, for his wise leadership. Chairman Mao's great talent has shown us a new path to building a country. On the one hand, he has adopted the highest social theory in the world, and on the other hand, he has deeply understood the unique actual situation of our country. He can integrate theory with practice, creating a new democratic path that is ideal, practical, and implementable.

The convening of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference indicates that the Chinese people's revolution led by the Communist Party of China has entered a new stage. As indicated in the preamble of the draft Constitution of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and the draft Common Program, this new stage is the end of the old era of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism in China, and the beginning of the era of the people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class, based on the worker-peasant alliance, uniting various democratic classes and ethnic groups to jointly build an independent, free, democratic, peaceful, unified, and prosperous People's Republic of China.

The three major documents proposed at this conference, namely, the draft Constitution of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the draft Constitution of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, and the draft Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, will undoubtedly become extremely important political documents in human history. They mark the great awakening of 475 million people, the great turnaround of one-fourth of the world's population, and the march towards independence, freedom, democracy, peace, unity, and prosperity. In many small group meetings, we have carefully and deeply discussed the content of these three documents. We are willing to unconditionally support the passage of these three documents at this conference.

From these three documents, we can see that our republic has two major tasks: on the one hand, we must overthrow and eliminate all anti-revolutionary forces of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, as well as the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang; on the other hand, we must restore and improve the people's economic production and cultural and educational undertakings to build a new country. Such a task of sorting out the past and building the future is undoubtedly arduous. Such arduous work is what any country must undertake in the process of revolution. However, I dare say that because of our past history and unique environment, no country's revolutionary process will be as arduous as ours. We are an ancient nation with a 4,000-year history of civilization, and at the same time, we are a country that is relatively backward in modern industrial progress, lagging behind by 200 years in primitive agricultural society. Because we have developed a high civilization over forty centuries, such a high civilization is rare in the entire history of mankind, and we are indeed proud of it; but precisely because of this, the baggage we need to discard is particularly heavy. Of course, in the beautiful courtyard of this ancient family, there are countless precious legacies left by our ancestors, but at the same time, there are also piles of outdated garbage that need to be cleaned up. How to sort out the past, discard the dross, and promote the essence is a very arduous task. Because we are an industrially backward country, we must catch up with the industrially advanced countries in the near future. We should strive to complete in twenty years what others have done in two hundred years. The numerous economic construction items listed in the fourth chapter of the Common Program on economic policy, which occupy a relatively longer section in the entire program, all reflect the focus of our future construction. We hope that in the Common Program of the second Political Consultative Conference, we can see that economic construction has made significant progress.

For the above two arduous tasks, we who are engaged in education and science should contribute our greatest efforts. Fortunately, the fifth chapter of the Common Program has clearly pointed out the direction of cultural, educational, and scientific development in the future People's Republic of China. We deeply believe that science and education are the foundation of all national construction. We deeply believe that science and education must actively develop in two directions to complete the heavy task of national construction. On the one hand, they must be popularized, so that the Chinese people can move from the primitive, manual, and natural-dependent classical cultural stage of thousands of years to the progressive, natural-utilizing, and nature-conquering scientific cultural stage. When the 475 million people all receive adequate scientific training and education, will there be any problem that cannot be overcome, whether it is social, international, or natural? The power of the masses is great, and the power of the masses who receive proper scientific training and education is even greater and incomparable. On the other hand, science and education must develop to a deeper level. We should not be afraid of its depth. We now need to catch up with the industrially advanced countries, and we may be able to catch up in a relatively short period; but we cannot always follow in their footsteps, always running behind them. We must hope to be able to keep up with them one day and even surpass them. In a competition arena, if you cannot surpass others, you will fall behind. All construction and all new production processes need high-level science and theoretical scientific research to lead. All construction and production undertakings must be served by highly educated and competent experts. When we learn how to make engines, we should start researching the utilization of nuclear energy early. Otherwise, when others have already used nuclear energy as power, we are still stuck in the steam and electricity stages, and we are still behind. Similarly, when we import superior varieties of animals or plants from others, we must also engage in genetic research and improve varieties ourselves. We cannot always follow others and enjoy the fruits of their research; we must be able to create in science. It is not enough for us to mechanically imitate and use the social, political, economic, and health systems of advanced socialist countries on the path to socialism; we must study our own national traditions, environment, and actual situation, which requires high-level specialized social science research. Any construction project, if it does not develop science, especially high-level science, in its own country, is like a river without a source, which will inevitably dry up, decline, and fall behind. Therefore, we must popularize science and education on the one hand, and develop high-level science and education on the other. This is especially the task that we in the education and science community should undertake. We believe that in this new republic, in the future, each of us will be able to work twice as hard at our posts to complete this heavy task.

**Zhang Naiji, Representative of the Democratic National Construction Association**

Participating in this historic conference makes us deeply realize the greatness of New Democracy and more intimately experience the correctness of the leadership of the Communist Party of China. The achievements of the conference prove that under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, following the path of New Democracy, we will surely reach the realm of independence, democracy, peace, unity, and prosperity.

The New Democracy developed from Marxism-Leninism is indeed the truth of the time and place; the democratic-centralist discussion method is indeed an effective means of seeking truth. This time, we all, as the masters of the state, in a harmonious and free atmosphere, seriously and enthusiastically discussed issues and put forward opinions. Interestingly, all the opinions that can solve problems are almost inseparable from the category of New Democracy. This is enough to prove that it is the truth of the time and place. The subcommittee discussions and plenary reports held alternately ensured that everyone had ample speaking rights, achieving free speech and thorough discussion, achieving repeated discussions and seeking details, and achieving the decisive role of the majority and the sincere submission of the minority. This is true and thorough democracy. Our Common Program, after seven subcommittee discussions and plenary reports in the Preparatory Committee, absorbed the opinions of the vast majority, and was finally smoothly passed as a draft at the plenary meeting of the Preparatory Committee, which is a typical example. In contrast, the old democratic parliamentary politics of the old democratic countries, which has only retained the form of democracy, has long abandoned the content of democracy. The majority party and the minority party each perform in the parliament for the interests of a few financial oligarchs, deceiving the majority of the people, and are as worthless as broken shoes and brooms. New Democracy represents a historic progress in China's politics. Handling state affairs based on this ideology, things will surely be done well.

Our evaluation of the conference is this: it is a great masterpiece of the great wisdom of the Chinese people gathered in a great era, under the great theoretical enlightenment and great leadership.

We, the Democratic National Construction Association, are an organization whose main task is to unite the national industry and commerce. We are particularly concerned about various measures related to the economic sector. Now everyone can see that in the Common Program, sixteen out of sixty articles are related to the economy—one in the general principles and fifteen in the economic policy chapter; in the Constitution of the Central People's Government, sixteen out of thirty-one departments are related to finance and economy. This, in theory, proves that the economy is the foundation of society, and at the same time, it tells us that the new state attaches great importance to economic construction. The tasks of the national industry and commerce are how great.

Everyone is already aware that after eliminating the oppression and shackles of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, the field of China's economic construction is truly vast, and the prospects for the development of national industry and commerce are truly limitless. To catch up with economic construction, to avoid the waste of capital, meaningless competition, and unregulated production, and more importantly, to ensure a peaceful transition to socialism in the future, a comprehensive economic construction plan and the strong leadership of the state economy are absolutely necessary. All national industry and commerce must realize that this is not only for the interests of the state and the people but also for the interests of the national industry and commerce. Therefore, they must provide all their knowledge and experience to make the economic construction plan very perfect; they must sincerely accept the leadership of the state economy, mobilize all their resources, brainpower, and physical strength, and undertake a part of the glorious task of economic construction. In this way, we can make up for the shortcomings of our past insufficient efforts for the revolution, so that we can stand in the ranks of the four friends of the new regime without shame. Here, it is particularly necessary to mention that we must be vigilant and prevent the conspiracies and sabotage of internal and external enemies, jointly safeguarding our new state.

An important content of the Common Program is that all revolutionary classes, under the leadership of the working class, cooperate with each other and each get what they deserve. In the economic sector, it is that various economies, under the leadership of the state economy, cooperate and each get what they deserve. At present, being able to have an environment where everyone gets what they deserve in the vast economic field guarantees that national industry and commerce have a great freedom of development. In the future, it will also guarantee a peaceful transition to socialism in a very satisfactory social environment and very good living conditions. At that time, the national industry and commerce will be able to get rid of the troubles and evils of the declining period of capitalism and become the free and happy masters of the new society together. Here, the national industry and commerce must be familiar with Chairman Mao's July 1st article, learning from the Communist Party to develop oneself and prepare to eliminate oneself, striving to develop one's own business and accumulate one's own capital, while at the same time preparing to eliminate one's own class when the conditions are ripe one day. It goes without saying that when eliminating one's own class, everyone will live more happily, and the business will continue to serve the people more gloriously.

The Common Program also tells us that in international affairs, we must first unite with the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries. This is not only in diplomacy but also in business operations and technical applications. The national industry and commerce must strive to understand our elder brother, the Soviet Union, and understand her extremely brilliant achievements in academia. It is necessary to understand that in a people's state, academic progress cannot be measured by the standards of the old era. Because of the consistency of the ideological foundation, we can boldly learn from the Soviet Union; at the same time, because of the inconsistency of the ideological foundation, we must critically accept the academic heritage of capitalism—except for some purely technical departments. In fact, capitalist countries will not teach us the most profound academic knowledge. Only the friends of the brotherly countries will be willing to speak without reservation. We have implemented this, which is beneficial to both the state and ourselves. In the future, we will strengthen economic mutual assistance with these many brotherly countries, which is a natural thing.

Finally, we would like to express our heartfelt thanks to all the representatives because, during the conference, we received many valuable instructions from you. The efforts of all the representatives have moved us greatly. We would also like to express our sincere respect to the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, and to the People's Liberation Army and General Zhu. With their correct leadership and heroic struggle, we have achieved today's revolutionary success and prepared extremely perfect conditions for the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. Our Democratic National Construction Association has made very meager contributions to the revolution and very small contributions to this conference. In the future, we will sincerely request the assistance and instructions of all the representatives to make our Democratic National Construction Association more substantial and stronger, follow the advanced elements, and undertake a part of the tasks of the times.

**Du Guozhen, Chief Representative of the Democratic Personages from the Areas to be Liberated**

The representatives of our unit are all from the water-deep and fire-hot areas under Kuomintang rule. We are honored and delighted to gather with the representatives of various democratic parties, people's organizations, liberated areas, the People's Liberation Army, ethnic minorities, overseas Chinese, and other patriotic personages to participate in this grand national founding event!

Firstly, we would like to thank the Preparatory Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, led by Chairman Mao, for its unremitting efforts over the past three months. This Preparatory Committee has given us a conference that is harmonious and representative of the people of all classes and ethnic minorities across the nation. This Preparatory Committee has drafted three profound and extensive documents that are in line with the historical trend and current needs of the Chinese people's revolution.

We have participated in two mixed small group discussions on these three documents, especially the draft Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, before the opening of the conference. Our unit has also held two discussions. We were able to speak frankly and contribute all our opinions, and we are grateful for the adoption by the Preparatory Committee. Therefore, we now unanimously express our sincere support for these three great documents, which were produced through high democracy and repeatedly revised through consultation, embodying the spirit of New Democracy. We hope that the conference will pass them smoothly and quickly establish the Central People's Government to realize the ideals and aspirations that the people of the nation have been fighting for over nearly a century. At the same time, we request that the soon-to-be-established Central People's Government, according to the provisions of the second article of the Common Program, lead the People's Liberation Army and the people of the nation to quickly liberate the Northwest, Southwest, South China, and other areas that have not yet been liberated, and save those people who are still in deep water and fire.

The representatives of our unit are all determined that, after the closing of the conference, we will thoroughly convey the high democratic spirit, democratic style, and all the resolutions of this conference to all classes and ethnic minorities in the areas to be liberated, unite and organize them, support the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, support the New Democratic Common Program, support the wise leadership of Chairman Mao; unite and organize them, cooperate with the guerrilla forces and people's armed forces in each region, welcome the People's Liberation Army, and support the orders of local people's governments and military control commissions, eliminating the remaining reactionary forces; unite and organize them, support the ethnic policies of the Common Program, cooperate well with ethnic minorities, strengthen Sino-Soviet friendship, and guard against the conspiracies of American imperialism to consolidate our borders; unite and organize them, assist all levels of people's governments to protect the legitimate interests of overseas Chinese, develop the cultural undertakings of overseas Chinese, so that the patriotic enthusiasm of overseas compatriots can have a concrete expression. These are our wishes, our tasks, and our future direction of efforts.

**Su Yu, Chief Representative of the Third Field Army of the People's Liberation Army**

I speak on behalf of the Third Field Army of the People's Liberation Army:

We are filled with boundless excitement to participate in this conference because we see that the ideals and struggles of the Chinese people over the years are beginning to be realized through this conference. The representatives present are so broad and active, and the unity and democratic spirit they exhibit set a great and excellent precedent for the entire nation.

The three documents proposed by the Preparatory Committee (the Constitution of the CPPCC, the Constitution of the Government, and the Common Program) have been repeatedly discussed by our delegation and unanimously agreed to be three great historical documents. They are the current Great Charter of the Chinese people, a concentrated expression of the will of the entire nation, and they clearly outline the guidelines for future political, military, economic, and cultural construction, enabling us to steadily build an independent, democratic, peaceful, unified, and prosperous New China. We unanimously support these three documents and are willing to strive for their implementation.

The Third Field Army is currently fighting in the East China region, and we will resolutely fight to completely annihilate the remaining enemy forces in East China and liberate the entire East China. Our people in the rear will immediately mobilize to wholeheartedly support the war, ensuring its early conclusion and the early start of national construction. The East China region is a newly liberated region, an area that has been under enemy rule for a long time and suffered severe destruction. Bandits, local tyrants, and remnants of the Kuomintang reactionaries are the main obstacles to the rapid establishment of revolutionary order. Therefore, it is necessary to mobilize the entire area's military and civilians to eliminate bandits and suppress local tyrants, creating the prerequisites for restoring and developing production, preventing natural disasters, and carrying out social reforms. These two points are the urgent tasks for the military and civilians of the East China area to implement the conference resolutions.

We wish the conference a great success, and we will resolutely carry out the conference resolutions among the people. We firmly believe that the Central People's Government emerging from this conference will be able to lead the entire nation to completely smash the desperate struggles of imperialism, feudal forces, bureaucratic capital, and the Kuomintang reactionaries, to carry the revolutionary war to the end, to quickly complete the unification of the nation, and to achieve great victories in construction!

Long live the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference!
Long live the People's Republic of China!
Long live the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao!

The long-awaited Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, eagerly anticipated by the entire nation, has now successfully opened. This is a joyous event for the people, a great joy for the country, and a great joy for all peace-loving people around the world. Our participation in this conference not only brings us great joy but also fills us with immense honor. We firmly support the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the Organizational Law of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and the Organizational Law of the Central People's Government, because these represent the collective will of the people, are a great charter for protecting the people's interests, and are the great achievements of the Chinese people's struggles over the past hundred years, especially the past thirty years.

On behalf of all the commanders, soldiers, and staff of the Third Field Army of the People's Liberation Army, I solemnly declare to the conference:

First, under the overall guidance of the Central People's Government and the Revolutionary Military Commission, we will, in the shortest possible time, annihilate the enemy in the Zhoushan Archipelago and Fujian, and strive to complete the task of liberating Taiwan within a short period. We will thwart the imperialist ambitions of the United States to colonize Taiwan and, in coordination with all the field armies, thoroughly eliminate all remnants of the reactionary forces, swiftly liberating the entire country!

Second, we firmly support the decisions of the Central People's Government and the Revolutionary Military Commission regarding unified command, unified system, unified organization, and unified discipline. Based on the principles of unity between officers and soldiers and unity between the military and the people, we will strengthen the political work system, preserve and carry forward the fine traditions of the revolution, and educate all members of the military with revolutionary spirit and patriotism. We deeply understand that after eight years of the Anti-Japanese War and three years of the War of Liberation, the people's production has not yet fully recovered, and the people's lives have not yet improved. National construction is in its infancy, and expenses are enormous. We must think of every possible way to overcome difficulties, contenting ourselves with the bare minimum for living, and taking "contributing more and enjoying less" as the highest honor for revolutionary soldiers.

Third, in addition to completing our military tasks to the fullest, we will earnestly and diligently mobilize and organize the masses, establish local armed forces, eliminate bandits and special agents, build and consolidate new liberated areas. In the future, we will continue to participate in agricultural and industrial production, reduce the burden on the people, and participate in the overall construction of the country.

Fourth, we will resolutely defend the victories of the revolution, redouble our efforts to raise the political awareness and military skills of the army, swiftly complete the regularization process, and build a modern national defense force to safeguard the integrity of the country's territory and sovereignty, and consolidate national defense.

The Chinese People's Liberation Army belongs forever to the people, is the people's own children, the protector of the people's interests, and the defender of the people's motherland. In the past, under the wise leadership and command of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, with the support of the broad masses of the people and the cooperation of various democratic forces, we have achieved great victories. In the future, we will adhere to the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, the orders of the Central People's Government and the Revolutionary Military Commission, and carry the revolution through to the end, striving to build an independent, democratic, peaceful, unified, and prosperous new China.

Long live the success of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference!

Long live the great unity of the Chinese people!

Long live the People's Republic of China!

Long live Chairman Mao, the great leader of the Chinese people!

### Title: Speech by Chen Boda, Chief Representative of Social Scientists

### Author:

### Date: 1949-09-21

### Page: 1

The Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference is a conference for the Chinese people to build their own country. The fact that social science workers have representatives participating in this unprecedented people's national-building conference in Chinese history is a great honor.

The representatives of social science workers unanimously support the drafts of the Organizational Law of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the Organizational Law of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, and the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. We believe that these three historical documents are a summary of the struggles of the Chinese people over the past hundred years and are the basic plans for the Chinese people to build a new China in the future. We will work together with all the people to strive for the full realization of the Common Program.

Here, I would like to briefly talk about the current situation in the intellectual circles of the entire country and the work in the field of social sciences.

The victory of the Chinese people's revolution has brought about a great revolution in all aspects of Chinese society. In the field of culture and thought, a similar great revolution is also needed, and in fact, this new cultural and ideological revolution has already begun on a national scale. Chairman Mao Zedong's article "On People's Democratic Dictatorship" said: "The changes are so rapid that many people feel surprised and need to relearn." People know that the old anti-people views cannot stand in the face of the people's revolution and need new people's views. They need to re-examine their thoughts, re-examine China, the world, the present, and the future, in order to determine their position and how to work again. Chairman Mao Zedong's thought of "serving the people" has become the most widely spread thought in Chinese history. People feel that by accepting this thought, they have discovered a new world, a new world with a true path for themselves. This ideological revolution has become a vast tide among the people. A prominent situation is that in all liberated areas across the country, there is a widespread upsurge in the study of social sciences. We social science workers believe that we must also relearn and carry out our own ideological revolution in this people's revolution, practice criticism and self-criticism, discard various erroneous things, accept correct things, and at the same time, unite with the natural science community and the literary and artistic community, contribute all our abilities to help the people and the academic community across the country carry out this ideological revolution and implement this ideological revolution.

We fully agree with the provision in Article 44 of the Common Program: "Promote the use of scientific historical views to study and interpret history, economics, politics, culture, and international affairs." This is an unprecedented great task in Chinese academic history.

Marxism-Leninism is the only social science. Chairman Mao Zedong, the leader of the Chinese Communist Party, applied this science to guide the Chinese revolution, turning this science into the material force of the Chinese people, which is why we have today's victory in the Chinese revolution. Comrade Mao Zedong's revolutionary scientific works are the crystallization of the wisdom of the Chinese people, a great glory and invaluable treasure of the Chinese people. Comrade Mao Zedong and the Chinese revolution under his leadership have opened up a broad path for the work of Chinese social sciences. We must follow the direction indicated by Comrade Mao Zedong to engage in the cultivation of many virgin lands in China that have not yet been cultivated by social science workers. In the process of the people's revolution, Chinese social science workers have done a lot of work in spreading the truth of Marxism-Leninism and destroying the ideological strongholds of the Kuomintang reactionaries and other reactionaries. However, it should be pointed out that compared to other revolutionary fronts, we are obviously too ashamed. The work in the field of social sciences is still far behind the actual needs of the revolution and the people. We feel that we must redouble our efforts to make up for this major shortcoming. The Chinese people have the ability to carry out such a great revolution that shakes heaven and earth, so why can't social science workers, based on the wishes of the people, contribute their due share? The key is to strive. To achieve this goal, it is still very necessary to be down-to-earth and serious in the current academic community. Without Chairman Mao Zedong's spirit of "seeking truth from facts," we cannot advance one step in science.

The convening of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and the establishment of the People's Republic of China have made the tasks of social science workers even more arduous. Chairman Mao Zedong said in his opening speech: "With the arrival of the economic construction high tide, it is inevitable that a cultural construction high tide will follow." We social science workers must welcome the high tides of economic construction and cultural construction, use all our abilities to catch up with the work of other departments. This is the current hope, but through everyone's collective efforts, hope can quickly become a reality. We are willing for the people to supervise our work.

Long live the success of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference!

Long live the People's Republic of China!

Advance under the great banner of Mao Zedong!

### Title: Speech by Liao Chengzhi, Chief Representative of the All-China Democratic Youth Federation

The Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference has officially opened. At this conference, the new People's Republic and its Central People's Government will be proclaimed, reflecting the will and aspirations of all the Chinese people. The Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, which embodies the great victory and great unity of the Chinese people, will be formally promulgated. The goals that the Chinese people and Chinese youth have fought and sacrificed for over decades have finally been achieved. On behalf of the 4.2 million organized members of the All-China Democratic Youth Federation and all the youth of the country, I enthusiastically celebrate the convening of this People's Political Consultative Conference, which embodies the great victory and great unity of the Chinese people.

The All-China Democratic Youth Federation aims to unite all youth who oppose imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, regardless of class, party, belief, religion, occupation, gender, or ethnic differences, under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong, to strive for the complete victory of the Chinese New Democratic Revolution, to transform backward agricultural China into a progressive industrial China, and to unite with democratic youth around the world to strive for lasting world peace, people's democracy, and a bright future for youth.

Our principles are now fully included in the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. This Common Program clearly points out the goals of struggle for all the people, including youth, fully represents the aspirations and interests of youth, guarantees a bright future for youth, and we not only express our full support but also call on all youth to strive resolutely for the realization of this Common Program!

We know that in the process of building a New Democratic China, we will inevitably encounter many difficulties. However, with the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, with the People's Democratic United Front organization—the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, which embodies the great unity of all the people, with the Central People's Government of the people, with the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, which is the common direction of struggle for all the people, that is, we have a common standard for mutual encouragement, mutual assistance, mutual criticism, and mutual supervision based on the Common Program, and with the assistance of the peace and democratic forces of the world, we can be more confident that we will be able to overcome all difficulties, smash these obstacles, and advance towards our goals. We firmly believe that the great unity of the Chinese people and the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party are the guarantee of all our victories!

Comrades, I assure you that our youth will inherit the glorious tradition of the May Fourth Movement, fully implement our Common Program, study hard, work hard, and complete our tasks under the leadership of the Central People's Government at various posts. We will forever follow Mao Zedong and forever advance with Mao Zedong!

### Title: Speech by Chen Mingjun, Representative of the Three Principles of the People Comrades Association

### Author:

### Date: 1949-09-21

### Page: 1

I represent the Three Principles of the People Comrades Association to express my views on the three draft documents prepared by the Preparatory Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference: the Organizational Law of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the Organizational Law of the Government, and the Common Program. After three months of preparation, the three draft documents have undergone repeated research and discussion by various subcommittees, and after being drafted, they have undergone multiple rounds of group discussions and revisions. Now they can be said to be very perfect and have epoch-making historical significance. These three documents have created a new page in Chinese history and have created a new life for the Chinese people. On behalf of all the comrades of our association, I declare to the conference: We wholeheartedly approve and support the contents of these three documents.

Next, we should explain a few characteristics of these three documents: First, these three documents are practical. For example, the Common Program can be said to be in line with what the Chinese people need today. There is not a single impractical high-sounding statement; every clause is achievable and must be achieved. We feel that everything is just right; the same is true for the Organizational Law of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and the Organizational Law of the Government. Second, these three documents have concretized the Chinese people's democratic united front, especially the Organizational Law of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, which clearly defines the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference as the organizational form of the Chinese people's democratic united front. From the National Revolutionary era of "National-Kuomintang cooperation" to the anti-Japanese national united front, all ended in failure. After decades of struggle by the Chinese people, it was not until today that the organizational form of the people's democratic united front was successfully completed. Today, our people's democratic united front has further expanded, consolidated, and strengthened, with richer content. These three documents fully reflect the spirit of this democratic united front. Third, these three documents reflect the class nature of our new state and its class relations, and establish the leadership of the working class. The old democracy denied the existence of classes, which was deceitful, and saying that the state is above classes was also wrong. The Chinese people's democratic dictatorship is a union of four classes, and it must be based on the workers and peasants, with the working class as the leader. The so-called "people" refer to these four classes, and the so-called "state" power also belongs to these four classes. Fourth, the Organizational Law of the Government specially proposes that "the government of the People's Republic of China is a government based on the democratic centralism of the people's congress system." This characteristic is unique to China, fundamentally different from the government system of capitalist countries, and not completely the same as the Soviet system. Today's people's congress system is also an elevation based on the development of the Chinese revolutionary movement. Sun Yat-sen once proposed to convene a National Congress, but unfortunately, he did not achieve it and passed away. As for the old Political Consultative Conference, although it was destroyed by the Kuomintang reactionaries, it left a deep impression on the Chinese people and proved that it was impossible to solve any tasks beneficial to the people by working with the reactionaries. However, due to that process, it developed into today's Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. Due to the historical lessons of the Chinese revolution, we have found this government organizational system based on the development of Chinese history, suitable for the national conditions and needs of the Chinese people. This system is a unique creation of China and is also the most suitable—this is the system of the people's congress.

Finally, let me talk about the position and aspirations of our association. Since Chiang Kai-shek betrayed Sun Yat-sen, the movement against the reactionary rule has begun. Our association is a united organization of Kuomintang democratic comrades who oppose the reactionary rule; it was established in Chongqing in 1945. In the era of the old Political Consultative Conference, we were already members of the democratic united front and have always stood firmly on the side of the people, working to dismantle the reactionary regime. Now we are participating in the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. We are willing to inherit the revolutionary tradition of Sun Yat-sen and, together with various democratic parties under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, engage in the construction of New China. At the same time, we firmly believe that the development of the revolutionary Three Principles of the People should merge with New Democracy. Those who use the old Three Principles of the People as a dogma to oppose New Democracy are all traitors to Sun Yat-sen and will be abandoned by the Chinese people and perish. We call on all revolutionaries of the Three Principles of the People to stand on the side of the people, work together to eliminate the remaining reactionary forces, and strive to build a New Democratic state!

### Title: Speech by Chen Chutong, Chief Representative of the National Industrial and Commercial Circles

### Author:

### Date: 1949-09-21

### Page: 1

I represent the national industrial and commercial circles to speak. We enthusiastically support the drafts of the Organizational Law of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the Organizational Law of the Central Government of the People's Republic of China, and the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. These three drafts, especially the Common Program, are the fruits of the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people's long-term struggle, obtained at the cost of great sacrifices by the Chinese people. They are fundamentally different from the anti-people pseudo-constitutions formulated by warlords, bureaucrats, and the Kuomintang reactionaries.

This Common Program was carefully drafted by representatives of 46 units, through separate, mixed, and repeated discussions, word by word, sentence by sentence, and cautiously formulated. It includes the voices of all strata of the people across the country and becomes the common will of the Chinese people. That is, the guidelines and tasks that all the people across the country voluntarily and must abide by, which can also be said to be the people's provisional constitution.

At present, there are still some compatriots who are moaning under the bloody rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries and have not yet been liberated. Therefore, our primary task is still to support the front line, that is, as the Common Program says, to ensure the supply of the revolutionary war. In the past, the national industrial and commercial circles have indeed suffered from the oppression and suppression of imperialism, feudal forces, and bureaucratic capitalism. However, in the people's liberation war, the peasants contributed everything they had, and we in the industrial and commercial circles should also mobilize all our strength to contribute to the development of production and support the front line, thoroughly eliminating the remaining Kuomintang reactionaries, so that the whole country can embark on the path of peaceful national construction.

We in the national industrial and commercial circles must quickly unite and participate in the economic construction of New Democracy. We must completely turn around the economic system that relied on imperialism in the past. With the determination of self-reliance, we must face the countryside and serve the people, rely on the strength of the people across the country, overcome all difficulties, and cooperate with the national economic construction plan to achieve it as soon as possible, so that an agricultural country can become an industrial country. To achieve this goal, the national industrial and commercial circles must be under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, sincerely and wholeheartedly cooperate in work, grasp it firmly, take into account both public and private interests, and take into account the interests of both labor and capital. In the policy of taking into account both public and private interests, we must recognize that the public should be the main focus and the private should be the auxiliary. Labor is the fundamental driving force of construction, and the use of capital should also be for the benefit of the people across the country.

New Democracy is a gradual path to socialism. However, today's policy is to develop production, prosper the economy, take into account both public and private interests, and take into account the interests of both labor and capital. The national industrial and commercial circles should not and will not have any doubts or concerns. The construction of New Democracy will certainly create the material foundation for socialism, pave the way for the development of socialism, and make it possible for all the people across the country to have enough food and clothing and live happily and freely. This is the hope of the people across the country and also the hope of the industrial and commercial circles.

Today, we must respond to the government's call, with the spirit of economizing and creating, develop our own business, and at the same time, reform ourselves to adapt to the new era, so that the industrial and commercial circles can become a powerful unit in the construction of New China.

Let us shout:

Long live the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference!

Long live the People's Republic of China!

Long live Chairman Mao!

Today, I, Cai Tingkai, represent the China National Democratic Promotion Association to speak.

The first session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference has officially opened in the expectation of the people across the country and the people around the world who support peace and democracy. This conference is the first page of the founding history of the People's Republic of China. This conference has ended the thousands of years of reactionary rule and begun the people's exercise of state power; this conference will give birth to the central government of people's democratic dictatorship. The people across the country are jubilant and excited! We welcome this glorious festival and cannot help but think of this great victory, which was won by the heroic struggle of the People's Liberation Army and the working class! It was won by the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao! We pay tribute to the workers and peasants across the country, to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu! We pay tribute to the People's Liberation Army!

The opening of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference shows that our democratic revolution has been basically completed, but difficulties are not yet over. In our southern and southwestern regions, there are still remnants of the Kuomintang reactionaries; in front of us stands the imperialist United States; and there are reconstruction and construction tasks waiting for us to complete. In the past, the unity of various democratic parties and people's organizations has already achieved the great fruit of overthrowing the reactionary rule; in the future, we should be even more united under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, more resolutely unite, to thoroughly eliminate the remaining reactionary forces, to smash the reactionary plots of American imperialism, and to build our people's democratic New China! The representatives attending this conference include representatives of various democratic strata, ethnic groups, and overseas Chinese from within the country, which is fundamentally different from the old democratic parliament that had the so-called election form but was actually controlled by the big bourgeoisie. There are no different opinions among us; our common opinions are fully reflected in the Organizational Law of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the Common Program, and the Organizational Law of the Central People's Government. These three documents have not only been repeatedly studied by the representatives of the Preparatory Committee but also incorporated the opinions of every representative who arrived in Beijing, fully meeting the requirements of the people across the country! These three documents are not only our national construction program but also the common action program of each participating unit. We must loyally and resolutely support it! Our future common goal is only one, that is, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, to build a people's democratic New China! The members of the China National Democratic Promotion Association will resolutely abide by and implement the Common Program, and are willing to stand at their posts, exert all their efforts to assist the complete liberation of the country, and carry the revolution through to the end, completing our national construction tasks!

The eyes of the world are on China today.

Our enemies are looking at us with helpless curses, and our friends are looking at us with joy and excitement.

Because the giant of the East has risen. The Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference has opened a new page in Chinese history. The long-term rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism has ended, and an independent, democratic, peaceful, and unified New Democratic China, implementing people's democratic dictatorship, has risen like the morning sun, illuminating Asia and the world!

Today, we can hold such a historic conference in the capital of the people because of the bravery and victory of the People's Liberation Army, the hard work of the working people in production and support of the front line, and the joint efforts of the democratic parties and democratic personages; and all this is due to the correct leadership and unremitting struggle of the Chinese Communist Party for 28 years. Therefore, we first pay our highest tribute to the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army!

The Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference is composed of representatives from the Chinese Communist Party, various democratic parties, people's organizations, various regions, the People's Liberation Army, various ethnic minorities, overseas Chinese, and other patriotic democratic elements. Looking at the list of all representatives, one can see its broad and universal representativeness; except for the reactionaries, all strata and aspects of the country have representatives, so our Political Consultative Conference is truly named. This conference is fully endowed with the substance and power of the National People's Congress. This conference also has a great significance, that is, it declares to imperialism and reactionaries: the Chinese people, united under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, are determined to strive together for the realization of New Democracy!

The blueprint for the Chinese people to unite and build a New China is now available. These are the three historic documents before us—the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the Organizational Law of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and the Organizational Law of the Central People's Government. The Common Program summarizes the long-term struggle experience of the Chinese people, stipulates the strategies for building New China, is practical, and does not make empty promises. The Organizational Law of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference stipulates that the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference is the organizational form of the Chinese people's democratic united front, ensuring the long-term unity and cooperation of all revolutionary democratic forces across the country, which is completely necessary. The Organizational Law of the Central People's Government, based on the principle of democratic centralism, establishes the system of people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class, based on the worker-peasant alliance, and uniting various democratic classes and all ethnic minorities within China. These three historic documents have all undergone repeated discussions by all representatives and then been drafted. All the representatives present have not only once but many times personally participated in such group discussions. Some small groups started meetings at 9 AM and continued until 11 PM, with everyone doing their best to speak out and speak to the point. Such a discussion method proves to be the most democratic—democratic in essence, not just formalistic democracy. We are convinced that these three major documents are completely in line with the interests and needs of the Chinese people! As representatives of the literary and artistic circles at the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, we solemnly declare: all literary and artistic workers across the country will wholeheartedly support these three major documents and will exert our greatest efforts to use various forms of art to propagate and educate the people across the country.

We literary and artistic workers are proud to be able to contribute our efforts under the leadership of the Communist Party in the people's democratic dictatorship of New China, but at the same time, we deeply feel the great responsibility. The draft of the Common Program, Article 45, says: "Promote literature and art to serve the people, arouse the political awareness of the people, and encourage the labor enthusiasm of the people." We literary and artistic workers have fully understood the urgency and importance of this task. For many years, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's literary and artistic policies, we have undergone self-education, united with the people, and striven to serve the people, first serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers. We have achieved some results, proving that our work is beneficial to the revolution and needed by the people, but we ourselves know that our efforts are still not enough.

The rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism in China has ended, but the ideological poison left by their long-term rule still needs to be thoroughly eliminated, which is our target that we must continue to strive for. The eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan and the three-year War of Liberation produced countless heroic fighters, labor heroes, model workers, and new qualities and heroic spirit of the people in the new era, which need to be conveyed through artistic images to mobilize and educate the broad masses of the people; this is also our target that we must continue to strive for.

The arrogant attempt of American imperialism and its running dog, the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique, to enslave the Chinese people has shamefully failed, but they will not give up so easily. The White Paper has already publicly admitted the new delusions and new plots of the Americans. We must arouse the people across the country, especially the intellectuals, to heighten their vigilance, to further unite around the Communist Party, actively participate in the international peace and democratic camp led by the Soviet Union, and respond to the plots of American imperialism to sow discord with resolute and united actions!

In the process of building New China, the tasks of struggle on the cultural and ideological front are arduous and long-term. Standing on the post of literary and artistic work, we literary and artistic workers must improve ourselves, educate ourselves, and together with cultural figures and the people across the country, strive for the cultural construction of the New Democratic state!

We shout:

Long live the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference!

Long live the people's democratic dictatorship of New China!

Long live the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army!

Long live the great leader of the Chinese people, Mao Zedong!

The convening of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference signifies that our great motherland has forever broken away from the fate of semi-feudalism and semi-colonialism, opening a new era in Chinese history, and thus laying a new foundation for the Chinese natural science community. From today on, science in China is no longer a decoration, no longer serving a few people, but serving the masses of the people.

The Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference states: "The culture and education of the People's Republic of China are New Democratic, that is, national, scientific, and mass culture and education." Such a policy has never existed and could not have existed in Chinese history because it can only be realized under the conditions of people's democratic dictatorship.

Due to the New China's culture and education being national, we must first eliminate colonial and comprador ideologies and firmly oppose imperialism. Now, the Americans are still colluding with Chiang Kai-shek, bombing us with planes, and blockading us with warships, and they still want to use so-called "democratic individualists" to establish a fifth column in China. We and the Americans are in a position of no compromise. We must loudly declare: "The Americans are the enemies of the Chinese people, and the Chinese people must use all means to overcome the sabotage of American imperialism." As Chinese natural scientists, like all Chinese people, today we must carry out the struggle between the two lines: we not only oppose any dependence, fear, and compromise towards imperialism, but we also oppose blind anti-foreign sentiments; we must distinguish between enemies and friends, firmly stand with the world people's democratic forces led by the Soviet Union, to consolidate our victory. At the same time, we must also distinguish between imperialists and the people within imperialist countries.

The Common Program also points out that New China's culture and education are scientific. We must resolutely fight against anti-scientific feudalism, fascism, and other reactionary thoughts. The Chinese Communist Party led the peasants to reform the land system, eliminating the material foundation of feudal forces. However, the feudal poison in people's minds is like weeds on the road, and we still need to use more effort to eradicate them. We know that the transformation of thoughts should be regarded as equally important as material construction. In schools, research institutions, laboratories, and every corner, everyone should encourage each other, correct each other, study hard, and transform themselves to become a new person of the new era, and thus become a new scientist of the new era.

The Common Program also points out that New China's culture and education are for the masses. We natural scientists must abandon the idea of self-preservation and self-admiration, firmly stand on the side of the masses, make science serve the masses, first serve the workers and peasants, and not just for the appreciation and use of a few people.

On September 26th, it is the 100th anniversary of the birth of the Soviet psychologist Pavlov. The Chinese natural science community sent three representatives to the Soviet Union to participate in the commemorative ceremony. Pavlov and his contributions to science are well known, but what I want to emphasize today is not his knowledge, but his spirit of adhering to the truth and serving the people. He initially did not understand the October Revolution in Russia. Later, he gradually saw the truth, understood the significance of the October Revolution, and became the most loyal supporter of the Soviet government. His laboratory was 12 kilometers away from his home. At the age of nearly 70, he rode a bicycle back and forth every day. At that time, the young socialist country was facing the armed intervention and blockade of 16 countries and extremely difficult material conditions. He planted vegetables and raised animals for his experiments next to his laboratory. In 1919, the Soviet Union faced famine, and Lenin entrusted Gorky to take care of his life, but Pavlov declined the government's personal assistance and only accepted the necessary subsidies for his laboratory from the government. Such a spirit can indeed be a model for scientists around the world.

We Chinese natural scientists should pursue the truth, follow the example of Pavlov, especially at a time when the Americans and Chiang Kai-shek are blockading and sabotaging, everyone should be aware, vigilant, endure hardships, work hard, face reality, and be down-to-earth, not be too ambitious, sincerely serve the masses, and abide by the Common Program we have formulated, support the Central People's Government we have organized. Soon we will see an independent, democratic, peaceful, unified, and powerful New China, like the sun, shining brightly in the east.

The Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference is convening at a time when the country is about to be completely liberated. The true era of the people has begun. The Chinese people have become the masters of their own country. The remnants of feudalism and the tools of imperialist rule will soon be sent to the Palace Museum. All war criminals against the people will be sent to the people's courts for severe punishment.

What a great victory! What a glorious deed!

Where did these victories and glories come from? Everyone knows that it is because the Chinese Communist Party, under the wise and correct leadership of Chairman Mao, led the people of the whole country to fight a revolution for decades, especially the People's Liberation Army's heroic battles over the past three years, that we have achieved these victories.

The great victory of the Chinese people's revolution has ended the feudal comprador rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, and the Chinese people have established their own government and country. At this time, the people of the whole country are concerned about Taiwan, which is still under the rule of the remnants of the Kuomintang reactionaries. Here, the reactionaries continue their anti-Chinese people's revolutionary activities and are also colluding with American imperialism, and even trying to organize Japanese fascist forces to come and destroy the fruits of the Chinese people's revolution. Because the Kuomintang reactionaries will be completely eliminated, the American imperialists' plot to occupy Taiwan has become even more active and open.

At this time, the people of Taiwan, who are oppressed and exploited by the Chiang-American reactionaries, are living in unprecedented depths of suffering and misery, but the people of Taiwan have already realized and awakened that they must eliminate the rule of the reactionaries, complete the New Democratic Revolution, and only then can the people of Taiwan achieve true liberation.

This new Political Consultative Conference, and the Central People's Government organized by this conference, and the proclamation of the establishment of the People's Republic of China, are all produced in accordance with the will and interests of all the people of China. The 6.7 million people of Taiwan, who have been fighting against the oppression and exploitation of the Dutch, Spanish, Qing Dynasty, Japan, and other foreign nations for more than 300 years, and against the feudal comprador rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, have been making blood sacrifices. This is also for this purpose. The people of the entire Taiwan Province fully support this national people's democratic united front organization, the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, fully support the Central People's Government that will be born, led by the working class, based on the worker-peasant alliance, and implement people's democratic dictatorship, and fully agree with the Common Program of this Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. Every clause in this Common Program represents our interests, so we not only should abide by it but also for the full realization of this Program, we must strive to the end. Just in the draft Program, Article 12, which says: "All levels of people's congresses are elected by the people through universal suffrage, and all levels of people's congresses elect all levels of people's governments," we are very satisfied. The political demands of the people of Taiwan, summed up, are just this. Just this one clause has enough power to mobilize the people of Taiwan to rise up and eliminate the rule of the reactionaries and smash all the plots of American imperialism.

Now, Taiwan has a relatively developed industrial foundation, with many factories of various kinds, abundant resources, vigorous production forces, developed railways, highways, and electricity, and many technical talents and diligent and simple people. Once liberated, it has many favorable conditions for the construction of New Democracy and can make a great contribution to the construction of New China. Due to its geographical location, it is also an important place for defending the territory of China and is important in national defense. Therefore, at this time, we urge the people of the whole country to actively produce and actively support the front line, quickly liberate Taiwan, and liberate the whole of China.

The Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League represents the people of the entire Taiwan Province, including more than 200,000 ethnic minorities, and expresses to everyone our complete agreement with the three documents, and at the same time, we are responsible for conveying to the people of Taiwan and organizing them to unanimously abide by and strive for the realization of this Common Program. The victory of the Chinese people's revolutionary war is developing rapidly, and the liberation of Taiwan will be soon. To build a democratic, prosperous, and model New Taiwan will also be quickly realized.

Long live the Chinese Communist Party!

Long live Chairman Mao!

Long live Commander-in-Chief Zhu!

Long live the People's Liberation Army!

Long live the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference!

Long live the People's Republic of China!

We, the representatives of the people's news community participating in the Political Consultative Conference, have carefully discussed the drafts of the Organizational Law of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and the Organizational Law of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, and unanimously agree that they are satisfactory. These three documents are the fundamental laws of our country. The Kuomintang reactionary government also had various laws, but any provisions in those laws that were beneficial to the people were false and were never implemented. Our current laws have a fundamental difference: every word in them must be strictly implemented. With these three documents, the Chinese people will definitely have more unified will and orderly steps, and the democratic cause of the Chinese people will definitely advance more rapidly.

After the plenary session of the conference passes these three documents, we, the news community, decide to support them with actual actions. Our methods are twofold. One is propaganda. We will repeatedly and widely propagate the significance of these three documents and the entire People's Political Consultative Conference to the people across the country, calling on the people across the country to unite under the leadership of the Central People's Government and strive for the realization of the Common Program and all the resolutions of the People's Political Consultative Conference. The other is supervision. We will use the power of public opinion to assist the people's supervisory organs to supervise whether various levels of government and all democratic parties and people's organizations are faithfully implementing the Common Program and all the resolutions of the People's Political Consultative Conference.

We, the news community, are greatly encouraged by the fact that the Common Program includes a special clause on news work and that the Central People's Government has established a Ministry of Information. The Common Program, Article 49, stipulates the protection of the freedom to report true news, which we consider very important. Under the rule of the Kuomintang, we could not report the truth. In the capitalist countries that advocate false so-called news freedom, the bourgeois newspapers, magazines, and broadcasts use untrue and harmful news to deceive the people and poison the people's minds. News workers who oppose this are restricted and persecuted. Only in socialist countries and people's democratic countries can the freedom of news workers to spread the truth be politically and materially guaranteed. We now have these guarantees in China. All news workers across the country will definitely wholeheartedly implement the guidelines of Article 49 of the Common Program. We will definitely fully report the efforts of the masses of the people to overcome the reactionaries and build a new life. We will definitely correctly and bravely use the weapons of criticism and self-criticism to enable our various levels of people's governments and fellow citizens of all walks of life to constantly correct mistakes and improve work. We will definitely loyally mobilize the people across the country to defend the interests of the people and the country, defend world peace, and strike at all reactionary acts that harm the interests of the people and the country and endanger world peace. We hope that the representatives of various aspects participating in the People's Political Consultative Conference will all stand up to lead and help us complete this glorious task.

专栏：

　　中国人民政治协商会议第一届全体会议
  　各单位代表主要发言
  　中国国民党革命委员会主席
    李济深　发言
    中国人民政治协商会议的召开，显示着中国人民空前的大团结，显示着中国人民从此自己来处理中国的事务，显示着人民的新中国的光辉灿烂前程。感谢中国共产党二十多年的艰苦奋斗和正确领导，感谢人民解放军的英勇作战，感谢全国人民与反革命势力长期搏斗，以及各民主党派、各人民团体和一切爱国民主人士的共同努力，摧毁了帝国主义，封建主义和官僚资本主义的反动统治，从此我们开始稳步走上建立一个符合人民愿望的新中国的道路。这不仅是在座的诸位代表，也是全中国人民所同感欣庆的。
    三个月来，经过人民政协筹备会中各位代表，在中国共产党和毛主席领导下共同努力，完成了召开中国人民政治协商会议诸项准备工作，特别是关系建国大业奠基工作的“中国人民政协组织法”，“中央人民政府组织法”，“共同纲领”等三大法案之起草。大会的主要任务，就是讨论和通过这三个法案，从而依据以成立全国人民所一致期望的中华人民共和国中央人民政府，实现共同纲领。我代表中国国民党革命委员会郑重表示，我们对于人民政协筹备会向大会提出的原草案，完全赞同。因为这个草案的基本精神和全部内容正是中国人民近百年来艰苦奋斗追求实现的目标，更与我党创始人孙中山先生的革命理想完全符合。
    我们要建立的新中国，即人民由被压迫地位变为新社会新国家的主人之新民主主义的中华人民共和国。在这新国家中，政权操在人民的手里，并剥夺违背国家利益的反人民的反动派——即代表帝国主义，封建主义和官僚资本主义利益的反动派之参政权利。这就是工人阶级，农民阶级，小资产阶级和民族资产阶级的统一战线，而以工农联盟为基础，工人阶级为领导的人民民主专政，中国人民在数十年中累积起来的革命经验，证明非走着上述四阶级联盟实行人民民主专政的道路，新民主主义的人民共和国便没有建立和巩固的可能。孙中山先生曾经指出过：“凡真正反对帝国主义之个人及团体，均得享受一切自由及权利；而凡卖国罔民以效忠于帝国主义及封建军阀者，无论其为团体或个人皆不得享有此等自由及权利。”引申其义，孙先生所要建立的民国，与我们今日所要建立的人民民主专政的中华人民共和国，在精神上是一致的。
    现在的世界，在中国人民面前，摆着两条不同的道路。一条是少数人压迫多数人，侵略其他民族，挑拨战争，威胁和平，且自身正走向没落之途的以美帝为首的帝国主义道路。另一条是没有压迫没有侵略，反对战争，维护世界永久和平和人类幸福生活的以苏联为首的国际和平民主统一战线的道路。中国人民将何去何从？孙中山先生积四十年之经验指示我们：“必须联合世界上以平等待我之民族共同奋斗”；又在临终致苏联遗书中说：“我希望国民党在完成其由帝国主义制度解放中国及其他被侵略国之历史的工作中与你们合力共作”。因为中国人民的利益，是和社会主义国家，新民主主义国家的人民以及被帝国主义压迫与奴役的民族是一致的。为了打倒我们的共同敌人，为了巩固和建设我们新国家，并保证我们中国通过新民主主义阶段，进于社会主义以致于世界大同之路，我们在国际上两条阵线中，只有“一面倒”，只有坚决的站在以苏联为首的和平民主阵线这一面，既没有二条道路，也没有第三条道路。
    旧民主主义的政治制度，实际上为少数资产阶级的专政；特别是帝国主义时代，旧民主主义国家的议会，更为少数金融巨头所控制。我们新民主主义国家，为了真正反映民意和有效的为广大人民服务，政府的组织，必须基于民主集中制的原则。孙中山先生曾指出：“议会政治往往成为压迫平民之工具。”我们更由于近二十年来累积的经验中，认为人民行使国家政权的机关，一方面要能真正代表人民；另一方面要使其有充分权力以推行国策。民主集中制的原则，就兼具两者之长。而且在巩固人民民主专政和展开新民主主义政治的、经济的、国防的、文化教育的史无前例的大规模建设的需要上，基于民主集中制原则的政治制度，应是我们所当采取的优良制度。
    新中国之经济建设，在于国民经济之全面改造，使中国由落后的农业国变为现代化的工业国，并保证其向更高阶段的社会主义经济道路上发展。因此必需取消帝国主义国家在中国的一切特权，没收官僚资本归人民的国家所有，有步骤地将封建半封建的土地所有制，改变为农民的土地所有制，保护国家的公共财产和合作社的财产，保护工人、农民、小资产阶级和民族资产阶级的经济利益及其私有财产；发展新民主主义的经济，稳步地变农业国为工业国。而经济建设的根本方针，是以“公私兼顾，劳资两利，城乡互助，内外交流的政策，达到发展生产，繁荣经济之目的”的。这与孙中山先生的“发展工商业”、“实行耕者有其田”、“节制私人资本”的主张，在精神上是一致的。
    新中国的文化教育，应与巩固人民民主专政，和发展国民经济政策相配合，因此，新中国的文化教育应为新民主主义的、即民族的，科学的，大众的文化教育。其主要任务，为提高人民文化水准，培养国家建设人才，并肃清封建的、买办的、法西斯主义的思想，发展为人民服务的思想。孙中山先生曾说：“人民受教育，是大家都要有平等机会的。”又说：“近代人类思想，注重谋大家的幸福。”，其与人民政协共同纲领中关于国家文化教育政策的规定在精神上也是一致的。
    综合起来说，中国国民党革命委员会，对于奠立建国初基而即将提出本会讨论通过的三项法案草案，即“中国人民政治协商会议组织法草案”，“中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领草案”，“中华人民共和国中央人民政府组织法草案”，认为是能够充分反映中国人民意旨的，不仅自身衷心地表示赞同，而且深信凡属同在人民民主统一战线共同奋斗的各民主党派，各人民团体，和爱国民主人士，以至全国人民大众，也都会一致表示赞同。本会一定能够顺利完成其任务，不过这只是万里长征中走完第一步。在今后的新中国建设的艰巨工作中，我们还要更加巩固四阶级联盟，在中国共产党及毛主席领导之下，按照本届会议制定的蓝图——共同纲领，不避艰辛再接再厉向前迈进！（附图片）
    华中解放区、中国人民解放军第四野战军代表
    黄克诚　发言
    我代表华中区代表和第四野战军的代表发言：
    我们以无限兴奋的心情参加大会，因为我们看到中国人民多少年来所追求所奋斗的理想，由这一次大会开始实现了。到会代表是这样广泛和积极，所表现的团结一致与民主作风，给全国人民做了一个非常伟大的良好开端。
    大会筹委会所提出的三个文件（即政协组织法，政府组织法，共同纲领），经过我们代表团反复讨论，一致认为这是三个伟大的历史文献，是目前中国人民的大宪章，是全国人民意志的集中表现，它对于今后的政治军事经济文化建设事业，都规定了明确的方针，使我们能够稳步的建立一个独立、民主、和平、统一与富强的新中国。我们一致拥护这三个文件，并愿为它的实现而奋斗。
    华中区目前正是进军华南与进军西南的基地，我们第四野战军坚决为最后消灭华中华南的反动残余势力、解放华中华南全部而作战，我们后方人民，将首先紧急动员起来，全心全力支援战争，使战争早日结束，使全国范围的建设事业早日开始。华中区是新解放的地区，是敌人统治很久遭受敌人严重破坏的地区，土匪恶霸国民党反动派残余势力，成为迅速建立革命秩序的主要障碍。故必须动员全区军民进行清匪反霸，造成恢复和发展生产，防治水旱灾荒，进行社会改革的前提。以上两点为我华中区军民目前执行大会决议的迫切任务。
    我们预祝大会的胜利成功，我们要坚决地把大会决议贯彻到人民中去。我们坚信：由这次大会所产生的中央人民政府，必能领导全国人民把帝国主义、封建势力、官僚资本及国民党反动派一切绝望的挣扎彻底粉碎，将革命战争进行到底，迅速完成全国的统一事业，争取建设事业的伟大胜利！
    中国人民政治协商会议万岁！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席万岁！（附图片）
    人民解放军第二野战军首席代表
    刘伯承　发言
    我们中国人民大团结的中国人民政治协商会议，在人民解放战争战胜了美国帝国主义全力支援的国民党反动政府之时，在历代国都的北平开会，商定共同纲领，成立人民民主专政的中华人民共和国及中央人民政府。这是新中国历史的伟大开端，这是中国人民以自己的革命创造力铸成了空前的光荣的史迹。我代表人民解放军第二野战军全体军人以无限的欢欣表示忠诚的拥护。
    中国人民解放军是工人阶级领导的人民大众的反帝国主义反封建主义反官僚资本主义的军队，而且是经过了二十二年斗争考验的军队。这个军队，如果在过去能够完成战胜敌人的任务，那末，今后在自己的中央人民政府领导之下，一定能够遵守政府法令，实现军事制度，完成解放战争彻底胜利，解放中国全部领土，提高自己，巩固国防，保卫人民和平建设的任务。
    我们第二野战军正在与全国野战军弟兄部队协同作战，执行解放西南华南的任务。我向大会保证一定能够彻底消灭西南华南残敌，巩固国防，协力保卫新中国建设的胜利进行，不负大会的期望。
    最后我们高呼：
    中国人民政治协商会议万岁！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    中央人民政府万岁！
    中国人民领袖毛泽东同志万岁！（附图片）
    特别邀请代表
    傅作义　发言
    全国人民一致期待的政治协商会议，已经开幕了。这才真正是国家大事，人民的大事，中国历史上划时代的大事，特别值得庆贺。我从绥远坐火车以最快的速度，赶来出席大会，并要在大会中向毛主席学习，向各位代表学习。
    我今天出席大会，感觉很惭愧，因为在北平和平解放之前，我还是一个反动派的重要负责人，那时候，我还看不清人民意志的方向，还继续和解放军为敌。到东北战事结束时，我才发现戡乱政策的错误，才认识到中共领导的正确。中国共产党和人民解放军，由小而大，如此迅速的发展，就是人民意志表现的标志。我既然发现了自己行为的错误，我就有过必改，敢于大胆的承认错误，立刻猛回头遵从人民的意志，实现北平和平，脱离反动派，走到人民方面来。虽然北平和平有助于革命的进展，虽然我尽一切努力，保全了有几千年文化积累的古城，几百万勤劳人民的生命财产，和可能成为人民首都的一切建筑，但我觉得我还是应该对过去反动的内战负责，我并且请求以战犯罪来惩处我。人民今天宽恕了我，毛主席的宽大政策，不惟不究既往，而且还让我追随毛主席之后，追随中国共产党各位代表之后，追随人民解放军各位代表之后，追随各民主党派各民主人士代表之后，参加中国人民政治协商会议，我真是既惭愧，又荣幸，更是无限兴奋。
    中国人民政治协商会议，是在坚苦奋斗，千锤百炼的中国共产党领导之下召开的，是在毛主席的亲自主持之下召开的，参加的单位和代表，包括了各阶层，各党派，各民族的民主进步人士，以及科学家，艺术家一切最优秀的人们。这些代表们，是人民的灯塔，人民意志的集中表现者。但这样一个会议，在反动政府的统治之下，是永远不可能召开的，在反动政府统治之下，今天出席会议的人们，只有被迫害，被屠杀，因为他们敢于独排众议，来替人民说话，只有在解放军已经基本上打败了反动派并即将完全肃清反动派残余的时候，我们才能召开这样一个代表人民意志的会议。这是中国历史上前所未有的真民主，是中国人民前所未有的大团结。
    这次会议的任务，正如毛主席在开幕词中所说：要制定人民政协的组织法，制定中华人民共和国中央人民政府的组织法，制定人民政协的共同纲领，选举人民政协全国委员会暨中央人民政府委员会，制定国旗国徽，决定国都所在地和平号。这是神圣的庄严的任务，我相信各位代表先生们，在毛主席亲自领导之下，一定会圆满的完成这个任务。
    筹备会所拟定的各项草案，我虽只作了初步研究，我觉得都是符合人民的意志与愿望，尤其共同纲领中自总纲起，政权机构，军事制度，经济政策，文化教育政策，民族政策，外交政策，都是根据中国社会的特质，根据人民的需要，和中国革命的目标制定出来的，没有空话，没有虚伪。人民民主统一战线保证这些政策的执行，这些政策的执行，也保证了人民民主统一战线必然的胜利。
    我们今天向全世界宣布：中国人民站立起来了。随着政协的召开，中华人民共和国，也即将光辉的建立起来，帝国主义和国民党反动派，封建势力，官僚资产阶级，已经失败了。虽然这些反动残余，是不会甘心失败的，但人心所向，大势所趋，他们一切阴谋诡计，都将在人民面前破产，都将是枉费心机。就如此次绥远军民的光荣起义，反动派曾一再进行分化、挑拨、欺骗、利诱，妄想加以阻挠和破坏，反动派说：“国际义勇军”组织起来了，“日本空军志愿队”组织起来了，这些无耻的宣传，对于曾经浴血抗日的军民，是一种莫大的污辱。绥远军民是经过锻炼的，是不会受骗的，恰恰相反，无耻的宣传，更增强了我们对反动派的憎恶，和走向人民方面的决心。作义这次到绥远时，蒋介石给了我一个“亲切的”电报，说我这次从北平到绥远，正象他当年西安事变以后从西安回到南京一样。他说，当他回到南京以后，由于一念之差，竟铸成今日危亡之大错，所以要我接受他的教训，不要自误误国误部下。但是我坚决拒绝了他，回到北平来出席政协会议，我相信有良心的爱国的国民党军政人员，都将成千成万走到人民方面来，反动派是破坏不了阻拦不住的。
    各位代表先生们，让我们和全国人民一起在毛主席的领导之下，掌握人民民主专政的武器，团结我们的国际友人，来一个经济建设的高潮，来一个文化建设的高潮，一个高潮接着一个高潮，来建立繁荣昌盛的中华人民共和国，在毛泽东的旗帜之下，我高呼：
    团结全国人民！
    团结国际友人！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    毛主席朱总司令万岁！（附图片）
    教育工作者首席代表
    成仿吾　发言
    我们教育工作者十七名代表，对于两个组织法与共同纲领曾经详细讨论，我们一致完全拥护这三个对于建设新的中国有伟大历史意义的文件。
    中国人民民主专政的政权，是中国人民经过长期艰苦斗争取得的胜利成果，我们的共同纲领最完整地体现了中国绝大多数人民长期的愿望。中国教育工作者过去在反人民的反动政权之下，历尽了长期的摧残与压迫，教育事业无法展开，个人才能无从贡献，黑夜曾经是那么漫长，斗争曾经是那么残酷，今天每一个教育工作者都亲身感到：只有人民民主专政的政权与这样的纲领，才是中国人民所需要，才符合我们大家的愿望。我们大家盼望了多少年月，今天我们的斗争有辉煌的结果。我们完全同意共同纲领与两个组织法所规定的建设新的国家的总方针与各种具体政策。
    中国的教育过去长期被帝国主义、封建势力、与官僚资本所控制，教育方针是反人民的，它用封建的买办的法西斯主义的思想来毒害青年学生和人民大众，而教育方针则从来是教育与人民的需要脱离或隔绝。反动统治这种反动的教育方针与错误的教育方法，只是为了极少数人的反动利益，完全违反中国人民的需要。只有在中国共产党领导的地区，很早实行了新民主主义的教育，积累了一些经验，成为我们发展新民主主义教育的基础。
    新中国的教育方针必须是新民主主义的，即民族的，科学的，大众的。只有这样才符合中国广大民众的需要。我们必须提高全国人民的文化水平，使他们个个都成为新民主主义社会的积极建设者，我们必须培养千万个新中国的建设人才。我们必须肃清封建的、买办的、法西斯主义的思想，使人民大众从反动思想的影响下完全解脱出来。我们的教育工作还必须贯彻为人民服务的思想，这种思想应该是我们唯一正确的教育思想。
    新中国的教育方法必须是理论与实际一致，我们的教育工作必须贯彻这一原则。
    我们完全同意共同纲领所规定的这样的方针、任务、与方法。
    我们也完全同意共同纲领所规定的关于教育工作的重点，即有计划有步骤地实行普及教育，加强中等教育与高等教育，注意技术教育，加强劳动者的业余教育和在职干部教育，给青年知识分子和旧知识分子以革命的政治教育，这在今天是需要的和恰当的。
    此外，共同纲领规定“有计划有步骤地改革旧的教育制度，教育内容和教学法”，我们认为也是完全正确的。
    新中国的建设是一个伟大的工程，是一个长期的工作。新民主主义的教育应该是成为新民主主义建设的强有力的工具之一。这也是一个过程。我们必须根据中国的具体情况，有计划有步骤地对旧的教育加以改革。我们的任务是繁重的，我们必须同心合力，团结全国文化教育工作者，并与各界各团体亲密合作，携手前进。我们已经有了人民民主专政的政权与共同纲领，我们一定在中国共产党，毛主席和即将成立的中央人民政府领导之下，坚决地为这个纲领的实现而奋斗。（附图片）
    特别邀请代表
    陶孟和　发言
    本席代表特邀单位教育科学界人士，贡献几句话在这个中国历史上没有先例的、人民大团结的、庄严盛大的中国人民政治协商会议之前。
    我们今天能够举行这个意义重大的会议，首先应该感谢中国共产党二十八年来坚苦卓绝的努力，没有中国共产党，没有今日。我们尤其应该感谢我们人民领袖毛主席的英明领导。毛主席的伟大的天才，指示给我们一个新的建国的途径。他一方面采摘了世界上最崇高的社会理论，而另一方面又深切地体会到我国特有的实际情况。他能够将理论与实际融会贯通，创造出一个趋向理想，切于实际，而又足以实行的新民主主义。我们对于毛主席的天才造就，应该致崇高的敬礼。
    中国人民政治协商会议的召开，表示中国共产党所领导的中国人民革命，已经进到了一个新的阶段。如中国人民政治协商会议组织法草案总则和中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领草案序言所标示的，这个新的阶段就是旧的帝国主义、封建主义、和官僚资本主义在中国的统治时期已告结束，中国人民今后以工人阶级为领导，以工农联盟为基础，团结各民主阶级、各民族共同努力，建立人民民主专政的独立、自由、民主、和平、统一及富强的中华人民共和国。
    在本届会议里所提出的三个重大文件，即中国政治协商会议组织法草案，中华人民共和国中央人民政府组织法草案，和中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领草案，无疑的将成为人类历史上非常重大的政治文献，因为它们标志四亿七千五百万生灵的大觉醒，世界上四分之一人口的大翻身，向着独立、自由、民主、和平、统一、富强的前途迈进。在多少次的小组会议里，我们已经对于这三个文件内容，仔细深入地予以讨论。我们愿意无条件地拥护这三个文件在本会议内通过。
    由这三个文件可以看出的，我们这个共和国要负起二重的任务，一方面我们必须推翻并且肃清帝国主义，封建主义，官僚资本主义一切反革命的势力及国民党的反动统治；另一方面我们又必须恢复和提高人民的经济生产事业及文化教育事业以建设新的国家。这样的整理过去建设将来的二重任务，不待言是艰巨的，这样艰巨的工作是任何国家在革命过程中所必须担负的。可是我敢说因为我们过去的历史与所处的特殊环境，没有一个国家革命过程中的任务，会象我们的那样艰巨的。我们是一个有四千年文明历史的古老民族，我们同时又是一个比较现代工业进步国家，落后二百年的原始农业社会。因为我们过去发展了四十世纪的高尚文化，象这样的高尚文化在整个人类史上不过寥寥可数的几个，我们诚然足以自傲；但惟其如此，我们等待扔掉的包袱，特别的多。当然在我们这个古老人家美丽的大庭园里，保存着无限的可宝贵的先人遗产，但同时也堆藏着反时代的，亟待扫除的垃圾。如何整理过去，去其糟粕，而发扬其精华，乃是一个极其艰巨的工作。因为我们是产业落后的国家，我们必须在最近的将来要赶上产业前进的国家，我们应该努力在二十年里走完人家在二百年里所走的长路。共同纲领的第四章经济政策里所罗列的众多经济建设事项，它们在整个纲领中所以占据比较更长的篇幅，均足以反映我们今后建设中的重点所在。我们希望在第二届政治协商会议的共同纲领里，可以看出经济建设已经获得了长足的进步。
    对于上面所说的两项艰巨任务，我们从事教育，从事科学的人们，应该贡献我们最大的努力。可喜的共同纲领的第五章里，已经明确的指出我们今后中华人民共和国文化教育与科学发展的方向。我们深切地相信科学与教育乃是国家一切建设的基础。我们深切地相信科学与教育必须积极地向两个方向发展，才可以完成国家建设的重大任务。一方面它们必须普及，必须使我们中国人脱离数千年以来原始的，手工的，依赖自然的古典的文化阶段而进到进步的、利用自然的、克服自然的科学的文化阶段。将来等到四亿七千五百万的广大人民，每个人都得到充分的科学训练与文化教育的时候，任何遭遇的问题，无论是社会的，国际的，自然的，还有不能克服的吗？民众的力量是伟大的，而受到适当的科学训练与教育的民众的力量，更要长大成伟大得无可比拟。就另一方面言，科学与教育必须向高深处发展，我们要不嫌其高不嫌其深。我们现在要追赶产业先进的国家，我们也许可以在相当短的时期里追赶得上；但我们不能永远追随在人家的身后，不能永远跟着人家跑。我们必须希望能够一旦与人家并驾齐驱，我们还要希望有一天能够安然超过人家。在一个竞赛场里，不能超过人家，便要落在人后的。一切的建设，一切新的生产程序，都需要高深的科学和理论的科学研究去领导的。一切建设的与生产的事业，都必须要受有高深教育的胜任的专家去服务的。我们在学会了如何制造发动机的时候，我们就该及早研究原子核能的利用，否则等到人家已经利用原子核能为动力的时候，我们还停留在蒸汽，电力的阶段，我们依然是落在人后，同样我们在输入人家的动物或植物的优良品种的时候，我们自己必须从事遗传学的研究，自己从事品种的改良。我们不能永远追随着人家，享受人家所研究的成果；我们自己必须能够在科学上有所创造。我们单是机械的模仿袭用走向社会主义的先进国家的，社会的，政治的，经济的，保健的制度，还是不够；我们必须研究我们自己的社会国家的传统，环境，以及其实际的情况，这个就需要高深的专门的社会科学的研究。任何建设事业，如果在本国里自己不发展科学，特别是高深的科学，就好似无源之水，日久就必然枯竭的，衰微的，落后的。因此之故，我们在一方面要普及科学普及教育，而另一方面还要发展高深的科学，发展高深的教育。这特别是我们教育界科学界的人们所应该担负的任务。我们相信，在这个新的共和国里，今后我们每个人一定可以在自己的岗位上，比过去加倍努力，去完成这个重大的任务。（附图片）
    民主建国会代表
    章乃器　发言
    参加了这一个历史性的盛会，使得我们更深刻地认识到新民主主义的伟大，更亲切地体验到中国共产党领导的正确。会议的成就证明了中国在中共的领导之下，遵循着新民主主义的道路前进，一定可以达到独立、民主、和平、统一、富强的境界。
    由马克思、列宁主义发展出来的新民主主义，的确是此时此地的真理；民主集中的讨论方式的确是寻求真理的有效手段。这次我们大家以国家主人的身份，在融和自由的氛围当中，很认真、很热烈地讨论问题，提出意见。很有意思的，凡是能够解决问题的意见，几乎都离不了新民主主义的范畴。这就足够证明它是此时此地的真理。分组讨论和大会报告轮番地举行，保证了大家都有充分的发言权，做到了知无不言，言无不尽，做到了反复讨论，不厌求详，做到了多数起了决定作用，少数心悦诚服。这才是真正的，彻底的民主。我们的共同纲领，在筹备会里面经过了七次的分组讨论和大会报告，容纳了绝大多数的意见，最后才在筹备会全体会议里面很顺利地作为草案通过，便是一个典型的例子。反过来看一看那衰老了的旧民主主义的议会政治，只残留了民主的形式，早已丢弃了民主的内容，多数党和少数党各自为着少数金融寡头的利益，在议场上扮演一番，以欺骗多数的人民，简直象破鞋子、破扫帚一般的毫无价值。新民主主义代表了中国在政治上一个划时代的进步。根据这个主义来处理国事，事情一定可以作得通，而且一可以作得好。
    我们对于会议的评价是这样：这是在伟大的时代当中，在伟大的理论启示和伟大的领导之下，集合了全国人民的伟大的智慧的一个极其伟大的杰作。
    我们民主建国会是一个以团结民族工商业为主要任务的团体，我们特别关心有关经济部门的各种措施。现在大家可以看到，在共同纲领里面六十条条文便有十六条是有关经济的，——总纲内一条，经济政策章十五条；在中央人民政府组织法里面，三十一个部门有十六个是属于财经方面的。这在理论上恰好证明了经济是社会的基础，同时告诉我们，新国家如此的重视经济建设，我们民族工商业家的任务是如何的重大。
    大家都已明白，在消灭了帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的压迫和束缚之后，中国经济建设的园地，真是海阔天空，民族工商业发展的前途真是无可限量。为求经济建设的迎头赶上，为着避免资本的浪费，无谓的竞争和无政府的生产，更为着将来和平地过渡到社会主义，全盘的经建计划和国营经济的坚强领导，是绝对必须的。我全国民族工商业家必然会认识到，这不但是为国家人民的利益打算，同时也就是为民族工商业家的利益打算。因此必然会提供出来全部的知识和经验使经济建设计划做得十分美满；必然会诚心诚意，接受国营经济的领导，动员全部的资力、脑力和体力，负担起来一部分经济建设的光荣任务。这样，我们才能补偿过去对革命努力不够的缺憾，使得我们今后站在新政权的四友之列而无愧。在这里，值得特别提出的，便是我们必须提高警觉，防止内外敌人的阴谋破坏，合力保卫我们自己的新国家。
    共同纲领的重要内容之一，便是各革命阶级在工人阶级的领导之下共同合作，各得其所。在经济方面，便是公私各种经济在国营经济的领导之下分工合作，各得其所。在目前，能在广大的经济领域中取到各得其所的环境，就保证了民族工商业有很大的发展的自由。在将来，更保证了要在很美满的社会环境和很优良的生活条件之下，依然是各得其所的和平过渡到社会主义。在那时，我们民族工商业家便可以摆脱资本主义衰老时期的苦恼和罪恶，同为新社会自由快乐的主人。在这里，我民族工商业家必须熟习毛主席的七一论文，取法共产党一面发展自己，一面准备消灭自己的伟大思想，在目前努力发展自己的事业，积累自己的资本，而同时准备在将来条件成熟的一天消灭自己的阶级。用不着说，当消灭自己的阶级的时候，每个人会更愉快的生活着，事业会更光荣的继续为人民服务。
    共同纲领还告诉我们，在国际上必须首先联合苏联和各人民民主国家。这不但在外交上要如此，在企业经营和技术运用上也要如此。我们民族工商业家必须加紧努力认识我们的老大哥苏联，认识她在学术上极其光辉的成就。要明白，在一个人民国家里面，学术上的进步是不能用旧时代的尺度来衡量的。因为思想基础的一致，我们可以大胆的师法苏联；同时，因为思想基础的不一致，我们必须批判的接受资本主义的学术遗产——除了某些纯技术的部门。实际上，资本主义国家是不会把最精深的学术传授给我们的。只有兄弟国家的朋友们，才肯知无不言，言无不尽。我们实行了这一点，是与国家和自己都有益处的。今后我们和这许多兄弟国家，要加强经济互助，那是当然的事情。
    最后，我们要向全体代表们致深切的谢意，因为在会议当中，我们接受了各位代表很多的宝贵指示。各位代表的努力也使我们万分的感动。我们更要向中国共产党和毛主席，向中国人民解放军和朱总司令致衷心的敬意；有了他们的正确领导和英勇斗争，才达到今天革命的成功，替中国人民政治协商会议准备好极其完美的条件。我们民建会对于革命的贡献太微薄，对于这次会议的贡献也太渺小，以后还要恳切的请求各位代表的协助和指示，使得我们民建会能够充实起来，坚强起来，追随诸先进之后，负担起来一部分的时代的任务。（⑵⑶）（附图片）
    待解放区民主人士首席代表
    杜国庠　发言
    本单位的各代表，都是从待解放的水深火热的蒋管区来的，我们得跟各民主党派、各人民团体、各解放区、各人民解放军、各少数民族、国外华侨、及其他爱国人士的代表们共聚一堂，参与这个开国的盛业，实在感到无上的光荣和愉快！
    首先我们要感谢由毛主席来直接领导的这个人民政治协商会议筹委会三个月来的不断努力，这个筹委会给我们商定了这样和衷共济的而又能够广泛地代表着全国各阶级和各少数民族人民的大会代表人选；这个筹委会给我们草拟了这样精深博大的而又能够适合于中国人民革命的历史趋向和当前需求的三大文件。
    我们对于这三大文件——尤其是中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领草案，在大会开幕前，就曾经参加过两次混合小组的讨论，本单位自己又举行过两次讨论，我们都能够坦白发言，把所有一得之见贡献出来，也多承筹委会的采纳，所以，我们现在对这三个用高度民主产生而又经过反复协商修正的具体表现着新民主主义精神的伟大文件，一致表示热诚的拥护，希望大会给予顺利通过，迅速成立中央人民政府，以实现近百年来全国人民所奋斗蕲求的理想和愿望；同时我们要求就要成立的中央人民政府根据共同纲领第二条的规定，领导人民解放军及全国人民迅速解放西北、西南、华南以及其他尚未解放的地区，拯救那些正在水深火热中的人民。
    本单位各代表都决心：在大会闭幕之后，把这次大会中所表现的高度民主精神、民主作风、和各项决议详尽无遗地传达到各待解放区各阶级各民族中去，把他们团结和组织起来，拥护中华人民共和国中央人民政府，拥护新民主主义的共同纲领，拥护人民领袖毛主席的英明领导；把他们团结和组织起来，配合着各该地区的游击队人民武装，迎接人民解放军，并拥护地方人民政府与军管会的法令、肃清反动派的残余势力；把他们团结和组织起来，拥护共同纲领的民族政策，善于和少数民族通力合作，加强中苏的友谊，严防美帝国主义的阴谋，来巩固我们的边疆；把他们团结和组织起来，协助各级人民政府保护国外华侨的正当利益，发展华侨的文化事业，使在外侨胞热爱祖国的热情更能够获得具体的表现。这些就是我们的愿望，我们的任务，我们今后努力的方向。（附图片）

    粟裕　发言
    全国人民盼望久已的中国人民政治协商会议现已胜利的开幕了，这是人民的大喜事，是国家的大喜事，也是全世界爱好和平人民的大喜事。我们参加这次会议，不仅感到非常的愉快，尤其感到无上的光荣。我们坚决拥护人民政治协商会议的共同纲领及人民政治协商会议的组织法和中央人民政府的组织法，因为这是人民意志的集中表现，是保护人民利益的大宪章，是近百年来，特别是近三十年来中国人民奋斗的伟大成果。
    我代表人民解放军第三野战军全体指挥员、战斗员、工作人员向大会坚决的表示：
    第一，我们在中央人民政府和革命军事委员会总的意图下，当于最短时间，歼灭舟山群岛和福建的敌人，尽一切努力于短时期内完成解放台湾的任务，粉碎美国帝国主义殖民地化台湾的阴谋，并配合全国各野战军彻底肃清一切反动派的残余势力，迅速地解放全中国！
    第二，我们坚决拥护中央人民政府和革命军事委员会的统一指挥、统一制度、统一编制、统一纪律的决定，并根据官兵一致、军民一致的原则，巩固政治工作制度，保持与发扬革命的优良传统，以革命精神和爱国精神教育部队的全体人员。我们深刻体验：经过八年的抗日战争和三年的解放战争之后，人民生产尚未完全恢复，人民生活尚未改善，国家建设，百事待举，经费开支浩繁，我们当想尽方法，克服困难，以维持最低生活为满足，并以“多贡献少享受”为我们革命军人的无上光荣。
    第三，我们除尽力完满地完成军事任务外，当认真地、努力地发动和组织群众，建立地方武装，肃清匪特，建设和巩固新解放区；今后我们当继续参加农业生产和工会生产，减轻人民负担，参加国家的全面建设。
    第四，我们当坚决保卫革命已得胜利，加倍努力提高军队的政治觉悟和军事艺术，迅速完成正规化，建设近代化的国防军，以保卫国家领土主权的完整，巩固国防。

    社会科学工作者首席代表
    陈伯达　发言
    中国人民政治协商会议是中国人民建设人民自己国家的会议。社会科学工作的同志们能够有代表来参加中国历史上这样破天荒的人民建国会议，认为是很光荣的。
    社会科学工作者的代表们一致拥护中国人民政治协商会议组织法、中华人民共和国中央人民政府组织法和中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领这三个草案，认为这三个历史文件是百年来中国人民斗争成果的总结，又是中国人民今后建设新中国的基本方案。我们将和全体人民在一起，为共同纲领的全部实现而奋斗。
    在这里，我想简单地说一说目前全国思想界的情况和社会科学方面的工作。
    中国人民大革命的胜利，引起着中国社会各方面的大革命。在文化思想领域内，同样地需要一个大革命，而实际上，这一个新的文化思想大革命已经在全国范围内开始了。毛泽东主席“论人民民主专政”的文章说过：“事变是发展得这样快，以致使很多人感到突然，感到要重新学习。”人们知道旧的反人民的观点在人民大革命的冲击之下已经站不住脚，需要有新的人民的观点，重新审查自己的思想，重新考察中国，考察世界，考察现在和将来，以便决定自己应处的地位，决定自己需要怎样来重新工作。毛泽东主席“为人民服务”的思想成为中国有史以来散布得最广的思想，人民觉得接受了这样思想，就是发现了一个新世界，同时是有自己真正出路的新世界。这个思想大革命已成为人民群众的广大潮流。很突出的情况，就是全国一切解放了的地方，都是普遍地引起了对于社会科学的学习运动的高潮。我们社会科学工作者认为我们同样地必须在这一个人民大革命中重新学习，进行自己的思想大革命，实行批评与自己批评，抛弃各种错误的东西，接受正确的东西，同时联合自然科学界和文艺界，贡献我们的全部能力，来帮助全国人民和全国学术界进行这个思想大革命，贯彻这个思想大革命。
    我们完全同意共同纲领第四十四条的规定：“提倡用科学的历史观点，研究和解释历史、经济、政治、文化及国际事务。”这是中国学术史上空前的大工作。
    马克思列宁主义是惟一的社会科学。中国共产党领袖毛泽东主席应用马克思列宁主义这个科学来指导中国革命，把这个科学变成中国人民大众的物质力量，才有今天中国革命的胜利，毛泽东同志的革命科学著作是我们中国人民智慧的结晶，是中国人民的伟大光荣和无价之宝。毛泽东同志和在他领导之下的中国革命，已给我们中国社会科学的工作开辟了广阔的道路。我们必须按照毛泽东同志所指导的方向来从事开垦中国许许多多为社会科学工作者所还未开垦的处女地。中国社会科学工作者在人民革命过程中，对于传播马克思列宁主义的真理，摧毁国民党反动派及其他反动派的思想阵地，是做过不少的工作的。但是，应当指出：如果比起其他革命战线来，我们显然是太惭愧了。社会科学方面的工作仍然大大落后于革命的实际与人民的需要。我们觉得我们必须加倍努力来填补这个重大的缺点。中国人民有能力干出这样惊天动地的大革命，难道社会科学工作者就不能根据人民的愿望，尽其应有的贡献吗？事在人为。问题在于努力。为达到这个目的，在现在学术界，提出朴素认真，依然是非常需要的。如果没有毛泽东主席“实事求是”的精神，我们在科学上是不能够前进一步的。
    中国人民政治协商会议的召集，中华人民共和国的成立，使社会科学工作者的任务更加重大了。毛泽东主席在“开幕词”上说：“随着经济建设的高潮的到来，不可避免地将要出现一个文化建设的高潮。”我们社会科学工作者必须迎接经济建设与文化建设这样的高潮，用尽我们能力赶上其他部门的工作。这是目前的希望，但经过大家集体的努力，希望就可能很快地变成现实的东西。我们愿意人民来督促我们的工作。
    庆祝中国人民政治协商会议成功！

    中华全国民主青年联合总会首席代表
    廖承志　发言
    中国人民政治协商会议正式开幕了。在这次人民政治协商会议上，新的人民共和国及其中央人民政府就要宣告成立，反映了全中国人民的意志和愿望的人民政治协商会议共同纲领，就要正式颁布，中国人民和中国青年数十年来流血牺牲争取其实现的目的，今天终于达到了。我代表中华全国民主青年联合总会有组织的四百二十万会员及全国广大青年，热烈地庆贺这一个体现了中国人民的伟大胜利和伟大团结的人民政治协商会议的召开。
    中华全国民主青年联合总会的宗旨，是团结全国所有反对帝国主义的、反对封建主义的、反对官僚资本主义的青年，不分阶级、党派、信仰、宗教、职业、性别、民族的区别，在中国人民领袖毛泽东主席的领导下，争取中国新民主主义革命的彻底胜利，将落后的农业的中国改变成进步的工业的中国，并联合全世界民主青年、为争取世界持久和平、人民民主和青年美好的将来而奋斗。
    我们的主张，现在都已完全包括在人民政治协商会议的共同纲领里面了。这个共同纲领，明确地指出了全国人民包括青年在内的奋斗目标，完满地代表了我们青年的愿望和利益，保障了我们青年美满的将来，我们不但表示完全拥护，并且要号召全国青年，要为实现这一共同纲领而坚决奋斗！
    我们知道：在建设新民主主义中国的道路上，自然是将会遭遇许多困难的，但是我们有了中国共产党和毛主席的领导，我们有了体现着全国人民大团结的人民民主统一战线组织——人民政治协商会议，我们有了人民自己的中央人民政府，我们有了全国人民的共同努力方向——人民政治协商会议共同纲领，也就是我们有了根据共同纲领互相鼓励，互相帮助，互相批评，互相督促的共同标准，我们有了遍于全世界的和平民主力量的援助，这就使我们可以更有把握地确信：我们一定能够克服我们所遇到的各种困难，粉碎这些障碍而向我们的目标迈进。我们深信：中国人民的大团结和中国共产党的正确领导，就是我们取得一切胜利的保证！
    各位代表先生：我向你们保证：我们青年必将继承五四以来的光荣传统，全力实现我们的共同纲领，我们要努力学习，努力工作，在我们中央人民政府的领导下，在各种岗位上完成自己的任务。我们要永远追随毛泽东，永远跟着毛泽东前进！（附图片）
    三民主义同志联合会代表
    陈铭枢　发言
    本人代表三民主义同志联合会，关于人民政协筹备会所起草的人民政协组织法，政府组织法和共同纲领三个文件发表一点意见。人民政协筹备会经过三个月的筹备，各小组起草三个文件曾经过反复的研究讨论，起草好了以后，又经过多次的分组讨论，修正再修正，到现在可以说已经成为非常完善而具有划时代历史意义的三个文件了。这三个文件创造了中国历史的新页，也创造了中国人民的新生。我代表本会的全体同志向大会宣告：我们对于这三个文件的内容表示衷心的赞成和拥护。
    其次，我们应该说明这三个文件的几个特点：第一、就是这三个文件的现实性，譬如共同纲领可以说每一条都是符合今日中国人民所需要的。这里面没有一点不合实际的高调，每一条都是可能做到的而且是必须做到的。我们感觉得一切都是“恰到好处”；其他如政协组织法，政府组织法，都使我们有同样的感觉。第二、这三个文件将中国人民民主统一战线具体化了，特别是政协组织法明白的确定了人民政协就是全中国人民民主统一战线的组织形式。从大革命时代“国共合作”的民族统一战线开始，后来又经过了抗日的民族统一战线，结果都失败了；经过全国人民多年的奋斗，直到今天才胜利的完成了人民民主统一战线的组织形式。今天我们人民民主统一战线更进一步的扩大了，巩固了，坚强了，有着更丰富的内容了。这三个文件都充分表现了这一个民主统一战线的精神。第三、这三个文件表现了我们新国家的阶级性和它的阶级关系，并确立了工人阶级的领导。旧民主否认阶级的存在是欺骗的，说国家是超阶级的也是错误的。中国人民民主专政是四个阶级的联合，并且必须以工农为基础，以工人阶级为领导，所谓“人民”的范畴就是这四个阶级，所谓“国家”政权也是属于这四个阶级的。第四、政府组织法中特别提出“中华人民共和国政府是基于民主集中的人民代表大会制的政府。”这一个特点，是中国特有的，既根本不同于资本主义国家的政府制度，也不完全同于社会主义的苏维埃制度。今天的人民代表大会制，也是依据中国革命运动历史的发展而加以提高的。孙中山先生曾经提出过召开国民会议，后来不幸未能实现而他逝世了。再如旧政协虽然被蒋介石反动派破坏了，但在中国人民中已留下很深刻的印象，并且证明了和反动派在一道不可能解决任何有利于人民的任务的。不过，由于有了那么一次过程，才发展成今天的人民政协。由于中国革命的历史教训，我们才找到了这一个根据中国历史发展，适合中国国情与中国人民需要的政府组织制度，这一个制度是中国独创的，也是最适合的——这就是人民代表大会制的制度。
    最后说到本会的立场与愿望。国民党自从蒋介石背叛了孙中山以后，反对反动统治的运动即已开始，本会就是反对反动统治运动的国民党民主派同志的一个联合组织；于一九四五年成立于重庆。在旧政协时代，我们已经是民主统一战线的成员之一，一直坚决的站在人民方面，从事瓦解反动政权的工作。现在我们参加人民政协了，我们愿意承继孙中山先生的革命传统，与各民主党派在中国共产党和毛主席的领导之下，从事新中国的建设工作。同时我们坚信革命的三民主义之发展，应该与新民主主义汇流。一切假借旧三民主义为教条而反对新民主主义的人，都是孙中山的叛徒，必为全国人民所共弃而归于灭亡。我们号召一切革命的三民主义者都站在人民方面来，共同努力肃清反动残余，为建设一个新民主主义的新国家而努力。（附图片）
    全国工商界首席代表
    陈叔通　发言
    本席代表全国工商界发言，我们热烈赞成中国人民政治协商会议组织法草案，中华人民共和国中央政府组织法草案，中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领草案。这三个草案尤其是这个共同纲领，是中国共产党和全国人民，经过长时期的奋斗，以全国人民的重大牺牲所换取得来的东西。这与过去军阀官僚国民党反动派所制定反人民的伪宪法，是在本质上完全不同的。
    这个共同纲领，是经过四十六个单位的代表，分别的，混合的，反复讨论，字斟句酌，谨慎制成的，他包括全国各阶层人民的呼声，成为全国人民的共同意志。那就是全国人民自愿，而且必须遵守的方针和任务，也可以说就是人民的临时宪法。
    目前还有一部分同胞，呻吟在国民党反动派的血腥统治之下，没有得到解放，因此我们首要任务，还是支援前线，就是共同纲领所说的应保证革命战争的供给。过去全国工商界诚然受尽了帝国主义，封建势力，官僚资本主义的摧残压迫。但是在人民解放战争中，农民贡献了他们的一切，我们工商界也应该动员一切力量，贡献出来发展生产，支援前线，彻底消灭残余的国民党反动派使全国走上和平建国的大道。
    我们全国工商界，要加紧团结起来，参加新民主主义的经济建设。要把我们以前靠帝国主义的经济体系，完全扭转过来。抱定自力更生的决心，切实做到面向农村为人民服务，依靠全国人民的力量，克服一切困难，配合全国的经济建设计划，早日实现，使农业国为工业国。要达到这个目的，全国工商界必须要在中国共产党领导之下，真心诚意的协同工作，要把握得稳，公私兼顾，劳资两利，在兼顾两利政策中，要认识到以公为主以私为辅。劳动是建设的基本动力，资本的运用一方面也应该是为全国人民谋福利的。
    新民主主义是徐步的走向社会主义的道路。但是今天的政策是发展生产，繁荣经济，公私兼顾，劳资两利，全国工商界不应该而且也不会有什么怀疑和顾虑。新民主主义的建设，必然可以创造社会主义的物质基础，铺平走向社会主义发展的道路，使全国人民都能够丰衣足食，快乐自由，这是全国人民的希望，也是工商界的希望。
    我们今天必须响应政府的号召，抱定节衣缩食，团结创造的精神，发展自己事业，同时也要改造自己，以适应新的时代，使工商界成为建设新中国的有力的一个单位。
    让我们高呼：
    中国人民政治协商会议万岁！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    毛主席万岁！（附图片）
    中国国民党民主促进会首席代表
    蔡廷锴　发言
    今天廷锴代表中国国民党民主促进会发言。
    第一届中国人民政治协商会议，在全国人民和全世界拥护和平民主的人民期待中，正式开幕了。这个会议，是中华人民共和国开国史的第一页，这个会议结束了几千年的反动统治，开始了人民大众行使国家的政权；这个会议将诞生人民民主专政的中央政府。全国人民对于这个会议是欢欣鼓舞的！我们迎接这一个光辉的节日，不能不想到这个伟大的胜利，是由人民解放军和工农阶级英勇奋斗得来的！是由中国共产党和毛主席英明领导得来的！我们要向全国工农向毛主席和朱总司令致敬！致敬！向人民解放军致敬！
    人民政治协商会议的开幕，说明了我们的民主革命是基本上完成了，但困难还不是没有，在我们的华南西南，还有国民党反动派的残余武装；在我们面前还站着一个美帝国主义；还有复兴建设工作等待我们去完成。过去，我们各民主党派及人民团体的团结，已取得了推翻反动统治的伟大果实；今后，我们更应在中国共产党领导下，更坚决的团结起来，为彻底肃清残余的反动势力，为粉碎美帝国主义的反动阴谋，建设我们的人民民主新中国而奋斗！参加这次大会的代表们，包括了国内各民主阶层，各民族及国外华侨的代表人物，这比之那徒有所谓选举形式而实际操纵在大资产阶级手里的旧民主议会，实有天壤之别，在我们中间，没有不同的意见，我们的共同意见都充分的反映在人民政治协商会议组织法，共同纲领和中央人民政府组织法里面了。这三个文件，不但经过了筹备会代表反复研讨，而且综合了先后到平的每一个代表的意见，是完全符合全国人民要求的！这三个文件，不仅是我们的建国纲领，也是每个参加单位共同的行动纲领。这三个文件我们必须忠实，坚决地去拥护它！我们今后的共同目标，也只有一个，那就是在中国共产党领导之下，建设人民民主的新中国！中国国民党民主促进会的会员们，将坚决的遵守和执行共同纲领，更愿站在自己的岗位上，尽一切努力协助全国总解放，将革命进行到底，完成我们建国的任务！（附图片）
    中华全国文学艺术界联合会首席代表
    沈雁冰　发言
    全世界的眼睛今天都望着中国。
    我们的敌人是用了无可奈何的诅咒的眼光望着我们的，我们的友人是用欢欣鼓舞的眼光望着我们。
    因为东方的巨人站起来了。中国人民政治协商会议展开了中国历史全新的一页。帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义长期的统治从此结束，独立、民主、和平、统一的新民主主义的，实行人民民主专政的新中国，象初升的太阳照耀着亚洲。照耀着世界！
    今天我们能够在人民的首都召开这样的历史意义的大会，是由于人民解放军的英勇善战，劳动人民的努力生产、支援前线，以及民主党派和民主人士的共同协力；而这一切，又都是由于我们有了中国共产党的正确领导和艰苦卓绝的二十八年长期的奋斗；因此，我们首先要向中国共产党和人民解放军致崇高的敬礼！
    中国人民政协会议是由中国共产党、各民主党派、各人民团体、各地区、人民解放军、各少数民族、国外华侨及其他爱国民主分子的代表们所组成的。看了全体代表的名单，就知道它的代表性的普遍和广博；除了反动派，全国各阶层各方面都有了代表，因此，我们这个政协会议冠以人民二字，是名副其实的。我们这个会议是充分具有全国人民代表大会的实质和权能的。我们这个会议，还有一个重大的意义，就是它向帝国主义和反动派宣告：中国人民团结一致在中国共产党领导之下，决心为实现新民主主义而共同奋斗！
    中国人民团结一致，共同建设新中国的蓝图，现在已经有了。这就是摆在我们面前的三个历史性的文件——人民政协共同纲领，人民政协组织法和中央人民政府组织法。共同纲领综合了中国人民长期斗争的经验，规定了新中国建设的方策，切合实际，不说空话。人民政协组织法规定了人民政协为全中国人民民主统一战线的组织形式，保证了全国革命民主力量的长期团结和合作，这就是完全必要的。中央人民政府组织法基于民主集中的原则，确立了工人阶级领导的，以工农联盟为基础的，团结各民主阶级及中国境内各民族的人民民主专政的制度。这三个历史性的文件都经过全体代表的反复商讨，然后草定，在座各位代表，都不止一次亲身参加了这种分组讨论，有的小组从早上九时开会，直到晚上十一时，每个人做到了知无不言，言无不尽。这样的讨论方式，证明是最民主的，——本质上的民主而不仅是形式主义的民主，我们深信：这三大文件是完全符合于中国人民的利益和要求的！作为人民政协会议的文艺界的代表，我们敢郑重宣告：全国的文艺工作者一定全心全意拥护这三大文件，并且将尽我们最大的努力，运用各种各样的文艺形式，对全国人民进行宣传和教育。
    我们文艺工作者，以能在共产党领导下的人民民主专政的新中国尽其所能而感到骄傲，但同时也深深感到责任的重大。共同纲领草案第四十五条说：“提倡文学艺术为人民服务，启发人民的政治觉悟，鼓励人民的劳动热情。”我们文艺工作者是充分体会到这一个任务的迫切和重要的。多年以来，我们文艺工作者在毛主席的文艺方针指导之下，经过了自我教育，和人民结合，努力为人民服务，首先为工农兵服务，我们有过若干成就，证明我们的工作对革命有益，为人民所需要，但是我们自己知道，我们的努力还很不够。
    帝国主义，封建主义和官僚资本主义在中国的统治虽已告终，然而他们的长期统治所遗留下来的思想意识上的毒素还待彻底肃清，这是我们必须继续努力的目标。八年抗日战争，三年解放战争，涌现了无数的战斗英雄，劳动英雄，模范工作者，新时代的人民的新品质，新的英雄气慨，需要通过文艺的形象，对广大人民进行动员和教育；这又是我们必须继续努力的目标。
    美帝国主义及其走狗蒋介石反动集团奴役中国人民的狂妄企图虽然可耻地失败了，可是他们不会就此甘心，白皮书已经公开供认了美帝的新的妄想和新的阴谋。我们要唤起全国人民，尤其是知识分子，提高警惕，要进一步团结在共产党周围，积极参加以苏联为首的国际和平民主阵营，以坚决一致的行动回答美帝国主义挑拨分化的阴谋！
    在新中国建设过程中，文化思想战线上斗争的任务，是艰巨的，而且是长期性的，站在文学艺术工作的岗位上，我们文艺工作者必须提高自己，教育自己，和文化界人士以及全国人民一起，为新民主主义国家的文化建设而奋斗！
    我们高呼：
    中国人民政治协商会议万岁！
    人民民主专政的新中国万岁！
    中国共产党和人民解放军万岁！
    中国人民领袖毛泽东万岁！（附图片）
    自然科学工作者首席代表
    梁希　发言
    中国人民政治协商会议的召开，表示我们伟大的祖国永远脱离了半封建、半殖民地的命运，在中国历史上开辟了一个新纪元，因此也就为中国自然科学界奠定了新的基础。从今天起，科学在中国，不再是一种装饰品，不再是为少数人服务，而要为人民大众服务了。
    中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领上，关于文化教育政策说：“中华人民共和国的文化教育，为新民主主义的，即民族的，科学的，大众的文化教育。”这种政策，中国历史上从来没有，也不可能有，因为只有在人民民主专政的条件下它才能实现。
    由于新中国文化教育是民族的，首先我们就要肃清殖民地，买办的思想意识，坚定反对帝国主义的意志。现在美帝还在勾结蒋介石，用飞机轰炸我们，用兵舰封锁我们，还想利用所谓“民主个人主义者”在中国建立第五纵队，我们和美帝处于势不两立的地位。赖普汉九月初旬在旧金山叫嚣着说：“中共是美国的敌人，美国要使用一切方法来阻止中共的扩展。”我们现在要大声疾呼：“美帝是中国人民的敌人，中国人民要使用一切方法来克服美帝国主义的捣乱。”作为中国的自然科学工作者，和一切中国人民一样，今天必须进行两条路线的斗争：我们既反对对帝国主义存在任何依赖、恐惧和妥协的心理，我们也反对盲目的排外思想；我们要认清敌友，坚决和以苏联为首的世界人民民主力量紧靠在一起，才能巩固我们的胜利。同时我们也必须把帝国主义者和帝国主义国家里面的人民区分开来。
    共同纲领又指出，新中国的文化教育是科学的，我们要坚决和违反科学的封建主义法西斯主义等反动思想作斗争。中国共产党领导农民起来改革土地制度铲除了封建势力的物质基础。不过封建余毒在人们的思想上正象路上长的杂草一样，我们还得用更大更多的力量去斩草除根。我们知道思想的改造，应该看作和物质建设同样重要。在学校里，在研究机关里，在实验室里，在任何一个角落里，大家要互相策励，互相纠正，努力学习，努力改造，做一个新时代的人民，从而做一个新时代的科学家。
    共同纲领又指出，新中国的文化教育是大众的。我们自然科学工作者要扬弃独善其身，自我欣赏的超人思想，坚决站在人民大众立场，使科学为人民大众服务，首先是为工农群众服务，不要只供少数人的欣赏和利用。
    九月二十六日，是苏联心理学家巴夫洛夫诞生百年纪念。中国自然科学工作者派了三位代表到苏联去参加纪念典礼了。巴夫洛夫和他在科学上的贡献是大家知道的，不过我今天所要特别提出的，还不在于他的学问，而在于他服膺真理和为人民服务的精神。他起初对俄国十月革命不了解。后来他逐渐认清了真理，了解十月革命的意义，他就成苏维埃政权最忠心的拥护者了。他的研究室离家十二公里，他以近七十的高年，天天骑了自行车来回跑。当时还在幼年的社会主义国家，遭遇到十六国的武装干涉和封锁，物质条件困苦万分，他在实验室旁边，自己种菜，喂养他试验所用的动物。一九一九年，苏联饥荒，列宁曾委托高尔基照顾他的生活，而巴夫洛夫辞谢了政府对他个人的资助，而仅接受了政府对他研究室的必不可少的补助。这种精神，真可做全世界科学工作者的榜样。
    我们中国自然科学工作者，要追求真理，要仿效巴夫洛夫，特别是在美蒋封锁和捣乱的时候，大家要觉悟，警惕，忍苦，耐劳，面对现实，脚踏实地，不好高鹜远，诚心诚意为人民大众服务，遵守我们自己所制定的共同纲领，拥护我们自己所组织的中央人民政府。我们不久便可以看见独立、民主、和平、统一、和强盛的新中国，象太阳一样，光芒万丈，升起在东方。（附图片）
    台湾民主自治同盟首席代表
    谢雪红　发言各位代表，各位来宾，和各位旁听先生们！
    中国人民政治协商会议，在全国将要完全解放的时候召开了。真正的人民世纪开始了。中国人民做主人了。几千年来的封建遗物和帝国主义统治的工具就要送到故宫博物院去了。一切反人民的战争罪犯们将要送到人民法院去受严厉的惩罚了。
    这是多么伟大的胜利呀！这是多么光荣的史实呀！
    这些胜利和光荣是由那里来的呢？大家都很明白，这是由于中国共产党——毛主席英明正确领导了全国人民起来作几十年的革命斗争，特别是人民解放军三年来英勇善战而得来的。
    中国人民革命的伟大胜利，已经结束了封建买办的国民党反动统治，而中国人民已经建立起自己的政府、国家的时候，全国人民所关心着的台湾，目前还被国民党反动派的残余势力所统治着。在这里，反动派依然继续着反对中国人民革命的活动，而且还在勾结美帝国主义，并企图组织日本法西斯力量要来破坏中国人民革命的果实。而因为国民党反动派将完全被消灭，美帝国主义侵占台湾的阴谋活动也就更加积极公开起来了。
    在这个时候，被蒋美反动派所压迫剥削着的台湾人民是在有史以来没有过的水深火热当中过着极端恐怖、凄惨的生活，可是台湾人民已经认识了和觉悟了必须消灭反动派的统治，完成新民主主义革命，台湾人民才能够得到真正的解放。
    这次召开的新政治协商会议，而由这个会议组织起来的中央人民政府，和宣告中华人民共和国的成立，是完全根据全中国人民的意志和利益而产生出来的。六百七十万台湾人民，三百多年来反对荷兰、西班牙、满清、日本等异民族的侵略压迫，和反对国民党反动派的封建买办统治，不断作流血牺牲的斗争也就是为了这个目的。全台湾省人民完全拥护这个全国人民民主统一战线组织的中国人民政治协商会议，完全支持行将产生的由工人阶级领导的、以工农联盟为基础的、人民民主专政的中华人民共和国中央人民政府，并完全同意这个中国人民政治协商会议的共同纲领。在这个共同纲领中的每一条都是代表着我们的利益，所以我们不但应该要遵守，而且我们为着这个纲领的全部的实现，必须努力奋斗到底。只在纲领草案第十二条中所说：“各级人民代表大会由人民用普选方法产生，各级人民代表大会选举各级人民政府。”我们就觉得非常满意，台湾人民的政治要求总结起来就是这个，仅仅这一条就有足够的力量能够号召台湾人民起来消灭反动派的统治和击灭美帝国主义的一切侵略阴谋。
    现在的台湾有着相当发达的工业基础，有很多的各种工厂，物资丰富，生产力旺盛，铁路、公路、电力均相当发达，还有很多的技术人材和勤勉朴素的人民，一旦解放了后，是有着许多新民主主义建设的有利条件，而对新中国的建设也可能有很大的贡献。而由于地理上的关系，为保卫中国国土，在国防上也是一个很重要的地方。所以在这个时候，我们要求全国人民积极生产，积极支援前线，迅速解放台湾，解放全中国。
    台湾民主自治同盟代表全台湾省人民，包括二十多万少数民族的高山人民，向大家表示对三个文件的完全同意，同时负责传达给台湾人民，组织他们一致来遵守，并为这共同纲领的实现而努力奋斗。中国人民革命战争的胜利发展，台湾的解放是很快了，要建立一个民主、康乐、模范的新台湾也很快就会实现了。
    中国共产党万岁！
    毛主席万岁！
    朱总司令万岁！
    中国人民解放军万岁！
    中国人民政治协商会议万岁！
    中华人民共和国万岁！（附图片）
    中华全国新闻工作者协会筹备会首席代表
    胡乔木　发言
    我们人民新闻界参加政协的全体代表，详细地讨论了中国人民政治协商会议组织法，中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领和中华人民共和国中央人民政府组织法这三个草案，一致认为满意。这三个文件，都是我们国家的根本大法。国民党反动政府也曾有过各式各样的法，但是这些法里的任何有利于人民的规定都是假的，都没有实行过。我们现在的法有一个根本的不同点，就是它的每一句话，都要严格地实行。有了这三个文件，中国人民一定会更加统一意志，整齐步伐，中国人民的民主事业一定会更迅速地向前进步。
    在全体会议通过这三个文件以后，我们新闻界同人决定努力用实际的行动来加以拥护。我们的办法有两个。一个是宣传。我们要把三个文件的意义和整个人民政协的意义向全国人民作反复的广泛的宣传，号召全国人民在中央人民政府的统一领导之下，为实现共同纲领和人民政协的一切决议而奋斗。再一个是监督。我们要用人民舆论的力量，协助人民监察机关，来监督各级政府和一切民主党派人民团体是否忠实地执行共同纲领和人民政协的一切决议。
    我们新闻界同人对于共同纲领列有新闻工作的专条，和中央人民政府设有新闻总署这两点，感到极大的鼓励。共同纲领第四十九条规定保护报道真实新闻的自由，我们认为十分重要。在国民党统治下，我们不能报道真理。在宣传虚伪的所谓新闻自由的资本主义国家，资产阶级的报纸、杂志和广播用不真实的和有害于人民的新闻，蔽塞人民的耳目，毒害人民的思想。反对这样做的新闻工作者就受到限制和迫害。只有在社会主义国家和人民民主国家，新闻工作者传布真理的自由才能受到政治及物质的保障。我们中国现在是有这些保障了。我们全国的人民新闻工作者，一定要全心全意地贯彻共同纲领第四十九条的方针。我们一定要充分地报道人民大众战胜反动派建设新生活的努力。我们一定要正确地勇敢地使用批评和自我批评的武器，使得我们的各级人民政府和各界同胞，能够经常地修正错误，改善工作。我们一定要忠实地动员全国人民保卫人民和国家的利益，保卫世界和平，打击一切危害人民和国家利益，危害世界和平的反动行为。我们希望参加人民政协的各方面同志，大家起来领导和帮助我们完成这个光荣的任务。 （附图片）
