　　In Memory of Mr. Pavlov
　　Zhang Xijun

　　One day in 1924, while I was conducting experiments on dog metabolism in the physiology laboratory at the University of Chicago, my teacher, Mr. Carlson, accompanied a white-haired old man on a visit. I was young and eager to show off my skills, so I told this visitor that the dogs used in the experiment were trained. The dog was lying on the table, wearing an oxygen mask, and its limbs didn't need to be restrained, etc. I gave a long explanation that I thought was a good demonstration. Afterwards, I was told that the visitor was the master physiologist Mr. Pavlov, and I realized I was "teaching my grandmother to suck eggs!"

　　Ten years later, we met again at the Fourteenth International Physiological Congress in Rome. He smiled when we shook hands, and my face turned red!

　　Three years later (August 1935), Mr. Pavlov hosted the Fifteenth International Physiological Congress in Moscow and Leningrad. This was our third meeting. I was honored to be in the same group with him, and with his special permission, I saw a demonstration by a plump female assistant who had worked with him for decades, using his famous dog, trained over many years, in his famous old laboratory, conducting an alternating response experiment. At the same time, several other assistants announced the effect of removing various parts of the dog's brain on the alternating response. I considered this experience to be the richest and most valuable.

　　Today is the centenary of Mr. Pavlov, an old senior I met three times in three different places over ten years, and an honorary member of the Chinese Physiological Society. In addition to entrusting Comrades Pan Shu and Feng Depei, representatives going to the Soviet Union to extend congratulations, to take the complete seventeen volumes of the Chinese Journal of Physiology as a birthday gift from the Chinese Physiological Society to the Soviet Socialist Republic, we also hope that if Soviet physiologists are preparing to publish a collection of birthday essays, they can inform us, and we may send one or two new scientific papers to commemorate our old senior.

　　Mr. Pavlov's contributions to physiology are extremely rich and countless. I can only select the essentials and briefly describe one or two:

　　Mr. Pavlov's work can be divided into three stages: (1) From 1878 to 1888, research on the circulatory system; (2) From 1890 to 1901, research on the digestive system; (3) From 1902 to 1936, research on conditioned reflexes.

　　The contribution to circulatory system research is the management of blood pressure and the function of the heart. Using trained dogs without anesthesia, performing blood vessel cutting and blood pressure measurement without the dog resisting, was the characteristic of Mr. Pavlov's experiment, which was much better than our usual experiments where we could only make the dog lie quietly on the table! Thinking about it now, I am still ashamed!

　　The contribution to the study of the digestive system is the control and management of the nerves of the digestive organs, and the function of the digestive organs in normal life.

　　Previously, all tests of gastric juice involved extracting a mixture of gastric, salivary, pancreatic, and bile fluids. Mr. Pavlov's teacher, Heidenhain, made a small pouch from part of the stomach, called the Heidenhain pouch. Although this could obtain pure gastric juice, the nerves of the small pouch had been cut off, and the gastric juice obtained was very little and abnormal. Mr. Pavlov devised a way to maintain the vagus nerve of the small stomach and made a Pavlov pouch, which obtained pure and normal gastric juice. All research on gastric secretion depends on this.

　　In 1888, Mr. Pavlov discovered the secretory nerve of the pancreas. In 1889, Mr. Pavlov and his colleague Chimanovsky published the most famous sham feeding experiment, proving the relationship between nerves and gastric secretion. The experiment used a dog with a Pavlov pouch and had its esophagus cut off. Everything the dog swallowed leaked out of the esophageal wound. Repeated swallowing did not allow any food to reach the stomach. However, the gastric juice of the Pavlov pouch flowed continuously. If both vagus nerves were cut, this sham feeding would no longer cause gastric secretion, so this secretion was named nervous or psychological gastric secretion.

　　The creation of conditioned reflexes is even more important. Mr. Pavlov transplanted the salivary gland duct, under normal nerve control, onto the cheek, using salivary secretion as an indicator. After more than thirty years of research, he fully developed this concept, which can be called a masterpiece in the history of world physiology. In his later years, he supervised his students to use this reflex to study the function of various parts of the central nervous system, which is especially important.

　　The above is my simple introduction to Mr. Pavlov's important contributions to physiology. These contributions have opened up many new fields in physiology, which are worthy of our permanent commemoration.

　　念巴夫洛夫先生
    张锡钧
    在一九二四年的一天，我正在支加哥大学生理教室内做狗的新陈代谢的实验时，我的老师克鲁森先生陪着一位白发老者来参观。我当时年轻，喜欢卖弄自己的本领，便告诉这位参观者：实验所用的狗，是经过训练的。狗卧在桌上，口带养气口罩，四肢用不着束缚等等。说了一大篇自己以为是很好的示范。事后经人告诉我，这位参观者便是生理学大师巴夫洛夫先生时，我才知道我是“班门弄斧”了！
    十年以后，我们又在罗马开第十四届国际生理学会时会见了。握手时他笑笑，我的脸热了！
    又经过三年（一九三五年八月间），先生主持第十五届国际生理学会，在莫斯科及列宁格勒开会，这是我们第三次会面。蒙他优遇，我同一个小组，得到他的特别允许，看见和他工作数十余年的一位胖女助手，用他训练许多年的名狗，在他的著名老实验室内，做了一次交替反应的实验示范。同时还另有几位助手，宣示将狗脑的各部分割除后，对于交替反应的影响。这一次我的收获认为是最丰富最宝贵的。
    今天是与我在十余年间，又在三个不同的地方，遇过三面的老前辈，我们中国生理学会名誉会员巴夫洛夫先生的百年诞辰。除托赴苏联致贺代表潘菽、冯德培二位先生，带去中国生理学杂志全套十七卷做为中国生理学会赠与苏维埃社会主义共和国为祝寿礼物外，并且盼望苏联生理学者，要是预备出一种献寿文集的时候，可以通知我们，我们也可能再送一二篇新的科学论文来纪念我们的老前辈。
    先生的生理学上的贡献极其丰富，不胜枚举的。我只能择其要者，略述一二：
    先生的工作可分三阶段，（１）自一八七八至一八八八年研究循环系统；（２）自一八九○至一九○一年研究消化系统；（３）自一九○二年至一九三六年。研究交替反射。
    循环系统研究的贡献，为血压的管理与心脏的机能。用受训练的狗，并不使用麻醉剂，经过割血管与测血压的手术，而不遭到狗的拒抗，是为先生实验之特色，比我们只能使狗静卧桌上，做平常的实验高明多了！思之至今汗颜！
    消化系统研究的供献，为消化器官神经的支配与管理，与正常生活中消化器官的机能。
    以前试验胃液，全是抽出胃与唾、胰胆液的混合液。先生的老师海得罕将胃的一部分做成小囊，名为海氏小胃。这虽然可得纯洁的胃液，不过小胃的神经已被切断，所得的胃液极少，且不正常。先生设法保持小胃的迷走神经，做成巴氏小胃，乃得纯洁的正常的胃液。一切胃分沁的研究，胥赖于此。
    一八八八年先生发明＠脏的分泌神经，一八八九年，先生与其同事西曼奥斯基公布最著名假饲喂的试验，证明神经对于胃分泌的关系。实验用装置巴氏小胃的狗，又将其食道切断，狗所吞食之物，皆自食道伤口漏出，反复吞食，竟无一点食物到达胃中。而巴氏小胃之胃液，则畅流不止。如将两侧迷走神经切除，则此假饲喂，不再引起胃分泌，因名此种分泌为神经的或心理的胃分泌。
    对于交替反应的创作，其贡献尤为重要，先生将唾腺管，在正常神经支配下，移植于脸颊上，用唾液分泌反应为标示，经三十余年之研究，发挥无遗，在世界生理学史内，允称杰作。晚年督率门徒，利用此反射作用，研究中枢神经各部的机能，尤为重要。
    以上是我很简单的介绍巴夫洛夫先生对于生理学上的重要贡献。这些个贡献在生理学上，开辟了许多新园地，值得我们永久纪念的。
