　　How to Start Teaching
    Hao Renchu, Jiang Shanye
    When a teacher first steps onto the podium, it's natural to begin by discussing the teaching objectives, plan, and methods for the course, rather than diving straight into the curriculum; or to briefly introduce oneself to establish an initial rapport with the students. However, this shouldn't be excessive or stray too far. We believe:

    I. It is essential to first understand the class's level, their views on this and other courses, any ideological issues they may have, and any requirements they might have. Ways to understand this can include tests, investigative meetings, group or whole-class discussions, individual conversations, and other materials. Information can be gathered from the students themselves, previous instructors, relevant school departments, and past academic performance.

    By comprehensively studying these materials, identify common ideological issues, address them with "purposeful aim," and, based on the majority's level and legitimate requirements, supplement and revise your plan that was created according to the teaching principles and existing teaching materials. Then, report it to the students, seek their opinions, and transform our plan into the students' plan, unifying teaching and learning. This is the first step.

    II. After starting teaching, don't simply rely on your own methods from start to finish. First, take the first lesson or first section as a trial teaching; after teaching it, encourage everyone to study and discuss, express their opinions, and see what aspects of the method, content, or pace are unsuitable. Humbly consider and accept the students' opinions and criticisms, correct shortcomings, promote strengths, and lay the foundation for half a year of teaching.

    Some people are not good at doing this, so even though they have knowledge, they don't achieve good results or even fail. If you learn to do this, do it well, and not just at the beginning but continue to do so regularly, you will improve day by day and achieve better results.

    This is the investigation and research and mass line in teaching, which is one of the basic principles of our teaching method.

　　怎样开始教学
    郝人初　江山野
    教员初次上讲堂，不讲正课，先讲讲本科的教学目的、计划和方法；或者简单地介绍一下自己，取得自己和学生间的初步的亲切关系，自然是可以的；但不宜太多，而且扯得太远，我们认为：
    一、首先要了解本班的水平怎样，对本科及其他课程的看法如何，有些什么思想问题，有些什么要求等等。了解的方式可以采取测验，开调查会，小组或全班讨论，个别谈话等等材料。可以从本班同学，以前的任课教员，学校负责部门和过去的作业成绩各方面搜集。
    综合研究这些材料，找出带普遍性的思想问题，“有的放矢”予以解决，并根据大多数人的水平和正确要求补充和修改自己根据教学方针和既定教材所作的计划，再向同学报告，征求意见，把我们的计划变成同学们的计划，使教和学统一起来，这是第一步。
    二、开始教学之后，也不是一下子凭自己的一套教到底。首先拿第一课或第一个段落作试验教学；教完后，发动大家研究讨论，发表意见，看方法上、内容上、进度上有那些不适合，虚心考虑接受同学的意见与批评，改正缺点，发扬优点，奠定半年教学的基础。
    有些人不善于这样做，因此虽然肚子里有货，收不到好效果，甚至垮台；如果学会了这样做，做的好，并且不仅一开始如此，而经常这样做下去，将会一天天的进步，收到更好的效果。
    这就是教学中的调查研究和群众路线，这就是我们教学法的基本原则之一。
