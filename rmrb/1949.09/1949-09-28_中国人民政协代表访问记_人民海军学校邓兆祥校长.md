　　Record of Visits to Representatives of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference
  　Principal Deng Zhaoxiang of the People's Navy School

    On the eve of Shanghai's liberation—February 25, 1949, a quiet dawn, before the sky was fully light, the cruiser "Chongqing," a ship of 7,200 tons, with its 574 sailors led by Captain Deng Zhaoxiang, heroically revolted in the waters of Wusongkou, Shanghai.

    When the reporter interviewed Captain Deng Zhaoxiang of the "Chongqing" cruiser uprising at this People's Political Consultative Conference, he was already the Principal of the Chinese People's Navy School. He attended the conference as a specially invited representative. He is from Gaoyao County, Guangdong, and is forty-seven years old this year. He is a naval specialist who has studied naval affairs since childhood. He studied naval affairs in the United Kingdom and went to the United Kingdom after Japan's surrender to receive the cruiser "Chongqing." According to Deng, the cruiser "Chongqing" was originally named "Zhendan" and was built in the United Kingdom in 1936, having participated in World War II. In order to receive the ship, the Kuomintang reactionary government sent students to the UK for study in 1945. After studying, it sailed to China in July 1948, becoming the largest warship in the Kuomintang Navy.

    When talking about the situation before and after the uprising of the "Chongqing" warship, he said excitedly: Our uprising was very natural. The navy, under the long-term rule of the Kuomintang, has completely become the "private property" of the reactionaries. Like the war criminal Gui Yongqing—the so-called commander-in-chief of the Kuomintang reactionary navy, a person who doesn't even understand the basics of naval knowledge. As soon as he took office, his relatives and friends were placed in high-level positions in the navy, allowing them to put on uniforms of naval generals and collude with him to act wildly at sea, arbitrarily robbing merchant ships carrying goods, and using warships to transport smuggled goods back and forth, while naval personnel with real talents were constantly being squeezed out.

    Speaking here, he was full of resentment and emotion.

    He continued: Under the rule of such corrupt and corrupt Kuomintang reactionaries, the navy will never have any prospects for development, let alone any construction. These kinds of corrupt situations inevitably make us naval personnel who hope to dedicate ourselves to the Chinese navy completely shatter our illusions placed on the Kuomintang. Last year, when we returned to China and passed through Hong Kong, we read many new progressive books and newspapers there and began to receive new enlightenment, and at the same time we had a preliminary understanding of the liberated areas. Later we went to Shanghai. But as soon as we arrived in Shanghai, we were invisibly insulted by the US naval authorities, because the good anchorages and good docks in the Huangpu River were occupied by American warships, and the sovereignty of the seaport was sold by Chiang Kai-shek to American imperialism.

    Mr. Deng Zhaoxiang said when talking about the uprising of the "Chongqing": "Although the American imperialists and the Kuomintang reactionaries knew about our uprising and repeatedly sent planes to search along the coast, we finally sailed victoriously into the liberated areas and were warmly welcomed by the local People's Liberation Army, the People's Government, and the people. But the American imperialists and the Kuomintang reactionaries were not reconciled, and they used fierce and crazy bombing methods to destroy the ship." Speaking here, he more firmly said: "Indeed, as Chairman Mao encouraged us, the reactionaries can destroy a 'Chongqing', but they cannot stop more warships from following us to the liberated areas. In less than half a year, dozens of sister ships following the 'Chongqing' uprising have sailed to the side of the people."

    When the reporter asked Deng about his feelings about living in the liberated area for the past six months, he said: I really knew too little about the liberated area before, and was even deceived by reactionary propaganda. Today, I truly live in the liberated area, which makes me deeply feel the greatness of the people's power, and more importantly, it makes me understand how I should stand on the side of the people to serve the people. In the liberated area, I truly found the power to build a people's navy. After arriving in the liberated area, we visited various factories, which further increased our confidence in our work. Now, more than 500 of our "Chongqing" uprising sailors are very accustomed to living in the liberated area, and everyone lives and studies very happily, and at the same time, they have improved their political awareness. Deng also pointed out that he was most moved by the unity of the military and civilians in the liberated area, and the harmony and enthusiasm of officers and soldiers in the army.

    Talking about building a new people's navy, Mr. Deng Zhaoxiang said excitedly and firmly: In order to consolidate national defense, we will definitely follow Chairman Mao's call and exert all our strength to jointly complete this task. To build a new people's navy, we must first start with the development of China's heavy industry, and at the same time train a group of naval personnel. He told reporters that the sailors of the "Chongqing" are now working hard at their studies, and each of them is preparing to put the task of liberating Taiwan on their own shoulders, and all want to have the opportunity to participate in the work of liberating Taiwan. When the whole of China is liberated, they will continue to strive to complete the construction of a strong Chinese People's Navy.

    Finally, Mr. Deng Zhaoxiang said to the reporter with a smile that he felt infinitely honored and happy to be able to represent the People's Navy to participate in the CPPCC meeting. He fully supports the three major documents such as the draft Common Program discussed at this CPPCC, and at the same time, he highly approves of General Su Yu, the representative of the People's Liberation Army, calling on the army to be honored to maintain the lowest standard of living, and firmly said that he will bring this opinion back to every sailor of the "Chongqing" uprising.

　　中国人民政协代表访问记
  　人民海军学校邓兆祥校长
    柏生
    上海解放前夕，——一九四九年二月二十五日，那是一个宁静的拂晓，天还没有大亮，在上海吴淞口的海面上一只载重七千二百吨的巡洋舰——重庆号，全舰五百七十四个海员在舰长邓兆祥的率领下，便英勇的起义了。
    当记者在这次人民政协会议中访问这位重庆号巡洋舰起义的邓兆祥舰长的时候，他现在已经是中国人民海军学校的校长。这次他以特邀代表资格来参加大会。他是广东高要县人，今年四十七岁。一个从小就学习海军的海军专门技术人员。到过英国学习海军，日本投降后，去英国接收重庆号巡洋舰。据邓氏谈，重庆号巡洋舰原名震旦号，一九三六年造于英国，曾参加第二次世界大战。国民党反动政府为了接收该舰，曾于一九四五年派遣学生赴英学习，学习后，于一九四八年七月驶抵中国。成为国民党海军中最大的一只军舰。
    谈到重庆号军舰起义前后的情形时，他兴奋的说：我们的起义是很自然的。长期在国民党统治下的海军，已经完全变成了反动派的“家私”。象战犯桂永清——所谓国民党反动派的海军总司令，是一个连海军常识都不懂得的人，他一上任，他的亲戚朋友们也就都放到海军的高级职位上，让他们穿上一套海军将领的制服，与他狼狈为奸的在海上作威作福，任意抢劫运货的民船，用军舰来往装运走私货物，而真正有才能的海军人员，却不断的遭受着排挤。
    说到这里，他充满了愤恨与感慨。
    他接着说：在这种腐败贪污不堪的国民党反动派统治下的海军，是决不会有任何发展前途的，更谈不上什么建设，这种种腐化情形，不可能不使我们这些希望致力于中国海军的人员，把寄托在国民党身上的幻想完全打碎。去年七月回国经过香港，在那里我们读了不少新的进步的书报，开始接受了新的启示，同时对解放区也有了初步的认识。后来我们又到了上海。但当我们一到上海的时候，便无形中受到美海军当局的侮辱，因为黄浦江中好的锚位，好的码头，都给美国兵舰占领了，海港主权都给蒋介石出卖给美帝了。
    邓兆祥先生谈到重庆号起义的情形时说：“虽然当美帝国主义与国民党反动派晓得我们起义后，曾再三的派飞机沿海寻找，但我们终于是胜利的驶进了解放区；受到当地人民解放军、人民政府和人民群众热烈的欢迎。但美帝国主义与国民党反动派是不甘心的，他们竟用凶狠的狂炸手段，把该舰炸毁了”说到这里他更坚决的说：“真的，这正如毛主席勉励我们所说：反动派他们可以炸毁一艘重庆号，但是他们不能阻止更多的军舰跟着我们来到解放区。才不到半年，接着重庆号起义的就已经有好几十艘兄弟舰船驶向人民的方面来了。”
    当记者问及邓氏半年来生活在解放区的感想时，他说：以前我对解放区了解的真是太少了，甚至被反动的宣传所蒙蔽着。今天我真正生活到解放区来，使我深深地感到了人民力量的伟大，更重要的是使我明白了自己应该怎样站在人民的立场上去为人民服务。在解放区我才确实的找到了能够发挥建设人民海军的力量。到解放区后，我们参观了各个工厂，这更增加了我们工作的信心。现在我们五百多个重庆号起义的海员都很习惯于过解放区的生活了，而且大家生活学习得都很愉快，同时也提高了政治上的觉悟。邓氏并指出他对解放区军民的团结，军队中官兵的和谐热诚最为感动。
    谈到建设人民的新海军，邓兆祥先生兴奋而坚决的说：为了巩固国防，我们一定会遵照毛主席的号召，发挥我们所有的力量来共同完成这个任务。要建设人民的新海军，首先要从发展中国的重工业做起，同时还要训练一批海军人员。他告诉记者，重庆号的海员们现在都正在埋头努力学习，他们每一个人都准备着把解放台湾的任务放在自己的头上，都想有机会能参加解放台湾的工作，等到整个的中国都解放了，他们将再继续为完成建设一支强大的中国人民海军而奋斗。
    最后，邓兆祥先生笑着向记者表示，他这次能代表人民海军来参加政协会议，他感到无限的光荣与愉快。对于这次政协中所讨论的共同纲领草案等三大文件，他是完全拥护的，同时他对人民解放军代表粟裕将军在大会表示军队应以维持最低生活为光荣的号召非常赞同，而且坚决说要把这个意见带回给每个重庆号起义的海员。（附图片）
