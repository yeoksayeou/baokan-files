　　We have already accumulated some experience in ideological education,
　　and in the future, we should combine it with more types of professional education to further improve ideological education.
　　Cheng Fangwu
　　In early 1937, as the national crisis deepened, young people from all over the country flocked to northern Shaanxi—the location of the CCP Central Committee—to study. Consequently, the Fourth Detachment was established within the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University (Kang Da), led by Comrade Dong Biwu, with approximately 500 students. This marked the beginning of our Party's large-scale unity and education of intellectual youth.
　　After the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, driven by patriotic enthusiasm, even more progressive young people from all over the country poured into Yan'an. In August, Shaanxi Northern Public School (Shaanbei Gongxue) was established, and classes officially began in September. Due to the excessive number of students, Yan'an could not accommodate them all. Therefore, Comrades Feng Wenbin and others established the Wartime Youth Cadre Training Class in Anwu Fort near Sanyuan, which also absorbed a large number of young people from various places. The study period was shorter, often only two weeks before they were assigned work. At that time, literary and art workers from various places also came to Yan'an, and the Lu Xun Academy of Arts was established, mainly under the responsibility of Comrade Shakov (Comrades Wu Yuzhang and Kang Sheng had served as presidents). By 1938, as young people continued to pour in, the Central Committee sent Comrade Luo Mai to work at Shaanbei Gongxue, establishing a Shaanbei Gongxue branch school in Guanzhong. Simultaneously, a Workers' School was established in Yan'an, specifically for workers from various places, with Comrade Zhang Hao as the principal.
　　In 1939, due to the development of the situation behind enemy lines and the need to cultivate cadres on a large scale, the Central Committee decided to merge Shaanbei Gongxue, Lu Xun Academy of Arts, Youth Training Class, and Workers' School to form North China United University, with Comrade Cheng Fangwu as the president. Together with the headquarters of Kang Da, they left Yan'an in early February 1939 and advanced towards the enemy's rear. Due to the flooding of the Fen River and various obstacles from the enemy, it was not until September that they passed through several enemy blockades in three echelons and reached the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region.
　　In October 1939, after arriving in Fuping, the entire school was divided into four departments: Social Sciences, Literature and Art, Workers, and Youth, and began recruiting students. Later, it merged with the Anti-Japanese and Nation-Building College and the Mass Cadre School in the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region. The names of the departments were changed several times, and the number of students sometimes reached more than 3,000. After countless enemy sweeps, they often dispersed into smaller units and were assigned to villages to help with work, persisting in cadre education behind enemy lines. Many cadres and students heroically sacrificed themselves in the struggle against the enemy, such as Comrade Fan Baoqi, the director of the Health Department, and Comrade Lü Guang, the chief of the Organization Section. During this period, the trainees were all cadres and rural intellectuals from within the liberated areas. Since 1942, due to young people often escaping from cities such as Beijing and Tianjin to the liberated areas, the school established political classes specifically for ideological education. From 1943 to 1944, because the environment behind enemy lines became more brutal, the school was reduced to its minimum size, often with fewer than 1,000 people, until Zhangjiakou was liberated after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, and the school moved to Zhangjiakou, where it was expanded again. After Chiang Kai-shek launched the civil war, the school retreated to Shulu County in the Hebei-Central Plains, and after the liberation of Shijiazhuang, it moved to Zhengding.
　　After the surrender of the Japanese invaders, the situation in the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu region developed. In early 1946, North China University was established, with Comrade Fan Wenlan as the president. The original cadre schools in Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu were transformed into the Institute of Technology, the Institute of Agriculture, the Institute of Medicine, the Institute of Literature and Education, the Institute of Finance and Economics, and the Institute of Administration. Later, the Institute of Arts was added. In about two years, due to the war, the school site was moved from Xingtai to Changzhi.
　　In 1948, North China was almost completely liberated, and the two major liberated areas of Jin-Cha-Ji and Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu merged. Under this new situation, North China University and United University merged to form North China University, with Comrades Wu Yuzhang, Fan Wenlan, and Cheng Fangwu serving as president and vice-presidents respectively.
　　After the liberation of Beiping, it moved to Beiping in March of this year. Zhengding was changed to a branch school, and a branch school was also established in Tianjin. In just a few months in Beiping, it has absorbed more than 15,000 students.

    努力完成为革命培养干部的任务吴玉章
    我们已经在回想教育上有了一些经验，
    今后要结合着更多种的业务教育，把思想教育提高一步。
    成仿吾
    一九三七年初，民族危机日益严重，全国各地青年纷纷跑到了陕北——中共中央所在地学习，于是在抗大中成立了第四大队，由董必武同志领导，同学约五百人左右，这是我党大量团结与教育知识青年的开始。
    抗战爆发后，由于抗日热情所激发，全国各地进步青年更大量的涌向延安，八月间成立陕北公学，九月间正式开课，因同学数量过多，延安无法容纳，逐由冯文彬等同志在三原附近安吴堡辨战时青年干部训练班，也大量地吸收了各地来的青年，学习时间更短，常常是两个星期就分配了工作。当时各地文艺工作者也纷纷来延，鲁迅艺术学院成立，主要由沙可夫同志负责（吴玉章同志和康生同志曾经任过院长）。到了一九三八年因为各地青年继续不断涌来，中央派罗迈同志来陕公工作，到关中辨陕公分校，同时延安又成立了工人学校，专吸收各地来的工人，由张浩同志任校长。
    一九三九年，由于敌后形势开展，需要大理培养干部，中央决定陕公、鲁艺、青训班、工人学校合并成立华北联合大学，任成仿吾同志为校长，与抗大总校一起于一九三九年二月初离开延安向敌后挺进。由于汾河涨水，以及敌人的各种阻碍，直到九月才分为三个梯队通过敌人几道封锁线到达晋察冀边区。
    一九三九年十月间到达阜平后，全校分为社会科学、文艺、工人、青年等四部，即开始招收学生。后来又与晋察冀边区的抗战建国学院、群众干部学校合并，各部名称经过几次变更，学生人数有时多至三千余人，经过敌人无数次的扫荡，时常化整为零，分配到乡村帮助工作，坚持了敌后的干部教育，培养了很多的干部，有不少的干部与同学在对敌斗争中英勇牺牲了，如卫生处长范宝齐同志，组织科长吕光同志等。这一时期训练的对象皆是解放区内部的干部与乡村知识分子。自从一九四二年后因平津等城市常有青年逃来解放区，学校逐成立了政治班，专门进行思想教育。一九四三年到一九四四年因为敌后环境更加残酷，学校缩小到最低限度，经常不满千人，直到抗战胜利张家口解放后，学校移到张家口，才又壮大起来。蒋介石发动内战，学校撤到冀中平原束鹿县，石家庄解放后又移到正定。
    日寇投降后晋冀鲁豫局面开展，一九四六年初成立了北方大学，范文澜同志为校长，把原有的晋冀鲁豫许多干部学校，分别改为工学院、农学院、医学院、文教学院、财经学院、行政学院，后又增设艺术学院，约两年间由于战争关系校址曾由邢台迁到长治。
    一九四八年华北接近全部解放，晋察冀与晋冀鲁豫两大解放区实行合并，北大与联大在这新形势下合并为华北大学，由吴玉章、范文澜、成仿吾三同志分任正副校长。
    北平解放后，于今年三月间移到北平，正定改为分校，天津亦曾设立分校，仅在北平这几个月内就吸收了一万五千余学生。
