　　Hopeful Cotton Harvest

　　Five Special Districts Including Handan Planted Over Five Million Mu of Cotton, Estimated to Produce 540 Million Jin of Seed Cotton

　　[Baoding Telegram] A good cotton harvest is expected in the central and southern regions of Hebei Province. This year, the province planted a total of 9,926,000+ mu of cotton. Except for 44 counties that suffered from various disasters and reduced cotton production, other areas are doing well. According to estimates from eight special districts, this year's seed cotton production could reach 569.6 million jin (Tongxian and Cangxian special districts not included). Preliminary understanding from the five special districts of Handan, Xingtai, Shijiazhuang, Hengshui, and Dingxian is that this year's cotton planting area is 5,980,000 mu, with an average yield of about 85 jin of seed cotton per mu, producing over 540 million jin of seed cotton. In particular, the Handan and Shijiazhuang special districts have soil suitable for cotton cultivation. Farmers have the habit and experience of growing cotton, pay attention to intensive cultivation, and have suffered relatively light disasters. The 2,630,000 mu of cotton planted can produce an average of over 100 jin of seed cotton per mu. The Baoding and Tangshan special districts planted a total of 1,540,000 mu of cotton. Although 640,000 mu suffered from water, hail, and other disasters, the remaining 900,000 mu of cotton fields can still yield an average of 50 jin of cotton per mu. Most of the fields in Tianjin Special District suffered from floods, but ten counties can still harvest 5 million jin of seed cotton. Currently, cotton plants in general areas are two feet tall, and farmers have begun picking cotton. At present, the trade departments should work with local party, government, military, and civilians to widely publicize to farmers: the government absolutely guarantees the interests of farmers, and as long as the lint is seven-eighths of an inch long, each jin of lint cotton will be purchased locally at the price of nine jin of millet. At the same time, attention should be paid to separately preserving clean, white, and long-fibered cotton, and more attention should be paid to selecting excellent varieties for planting next year.

　　河北省中南部地区
  　棉花丰收有望
    邯郸等五专区植棉五百余万亩预计产籽棉五亿四千余万市斤
    【保定电】河北省中、南部地区，棉花可望丰收。今年全省共植棉九百九十二万六千余亩，除四十四个县因遭到各种不同灾害，棉产减收外，其他地区尚称良好。据八个专区估计，今年能产籽棉五亿六千九百六十万斤（通县、沧县专区未算在内）。邯郸、邢台、石门、衡水、定县五个专区初步了解，今年植棉五百九十八万亩，平均每亩摘花八十五市斤左右，能产籽棉五亿四千多万市斤。尤其邯郸、石门两专区，土质适宜种棉，农民都有种棉习惯和经验，注意精耕细作，加上灾害较轻，所植二百六十三万亩棉花，平均每亩可摘籽棉百斤以上。保定、唐山两专区，共植棉一百五十四万亩，虽有六十四万亩遭到水、雹等灾害，其余九十万亩棉地，平均每亩也可摘花五十斤。天津专区绝大部分田禾遭受水灾，而有十个县尚能摘籽棉五百万斤。现一般地区棉棵皆高二尺，农民已开始摘花。当前贸易部门应协同各地党政军民，广泛向农民宣传：政府绝对保证农民利益，只要绒长在一英寸的八分之七的皮棉，每斤定以九斤小米价格当地收购。同时要注意把干净洁白绒长的棉花，分别保存好，更要注意先选择优良品种，以备来年植种。
