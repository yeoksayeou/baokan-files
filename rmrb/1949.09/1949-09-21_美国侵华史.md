　　A History of American Aggression Against China
    Liu Danian
  　III. Contending for Hegemony in China (Continued from XXI)
    At this time, Chiang Kai-shek's spokesman announced: "The military suppression of the Communists is completing its final assault preparations and will use aircraft for bombing." (Note: Oriental Magazine, Vol. 30, No. 22.) To further direct Chiang Kai-shek's operations, the United States comprehensively cooperated with Chiang militarily around this time. Chiang Kai-shek convened the Lushan Conference, passing a military expansion plan with a total budget of 500 million yuan. This plan, apart from a three-year period as part of the U.S. Navy's preparation to overwhelm the Japanese Navy by 1936 (Note: Diplomatic Monthly, Vol. 3, No. 5, citing a communication from Japanese national Yoshioka Bunroku), also involved a large number of American military personnel participating in the "Military Advisory Group" headed by German General von Seeckt, specializing in researching and teaching military strategies for "suppressing the Communists." Chiang Kai-shek's so-called "Fifth Encirclement Campaign" against the Chinese People's Red Army was conducted under these American arrangements.
    In the same year, the U.S. government, targeting China as the most important silver standard country in the world, stipulated a silver policy. The policy aimed to purchase 24,421,410 ounces of silver annually for four years to raise silver prices, contend for leadership of Chinese currency, and strengthen the economic struggle between the United States, Britain, and Japan in China (Note: See Oriental Magazine, Vol. 31, No. 8). This triggered foreign expatriate associations led by Britain and Japan to denounce the U.S. move as "an attempt to realize the silver group's control over the Chinese market, not only disrupting China's monetary system but also threatening the financial and commercial interests of all countries in China" (Note: Dasheng: The Conflict Between Rising Silver Prices and the Interests of Great Powers in China, see ibid.). Simultaneously, the United States, through the League of Nations, engaged in technical cooperation with Britain in China, attempting to divide Britain and Japan.
    In February-March 1934, Hull and Japanese Foreign Minister Koki Hirota exchanged amicable letters, expressing, "This government, in the spirit of friendship,... will study Japan's circumstances" (Note: U.S. White Paper), encouraging Japan to advance toward the Soviet Union. On April 17th of the same year, Japan issued the so-called Amau Doctrine to find a new pretext for attacking China, claiming exclusive control over China and criticizing Britain and the United States. On April 25th, British Ambassador to Japan, Lindley, also told Hirota that if the Amau Doctrine aimed to oppose other countries helping China resist Japan, Japan could rest assured that "the British government has no such intention." Hull hastily instructed the U.S. Ambassador to Japan, Grew, to send a note to the Japanese Foreign Minister on April 29th, opposing the Japanese government's statement. However, it still pointed out a way for Japan, stating that the United States was willing to "appropriately consider" Japan's interests, as long as Japan did not harm the primary rights of the United States in China (Note: Ibid.).
    Soon after, the United States initiated a "Withdraw from China" propaganda campaign. Experts on Far Eastern issues, such as Bisson, published articles on the new situation in the Pacific, stating that the United States had three possibilities, the second being a total retreat in the Pacific. Walter Lippmann, a famous reporter for the New York Herald Tribune, wrote an article titled "Britain and the United States," saying, "The interests of the United States in the Far East are less than one-sixth of Britain's..." Stimson also published "The Crisis in the Far East," attributing the responsibility for Japan's attack on China to Britain's inability to cooperate against Japan. Needless to say, the purpose of this movement was still for the United States to alienate British-Japanese relations, threatening Britain to be used for its own benefit.
    In October 1934, the main force of the Chinese Red Army marched north to resist Japan, arriving in northern Shaanxi in October 1935. The anti-Japanese upsurge shook the whole country. Until this point, Japan still had not attacked the Soviet Union as the United States had hoped. Instead, it launched several so-called "North China Incidents," and Chiang Kai-shek showed the possibility of completely becoming a Japanese dog. The United States, however, continued to implement its established policy. In March 1935, upon Britain's proposal, the two countries decided on joint Anglo-American financial action toward China. In April, an "Economic Investigation Group" was sent to China, and in early November, Vice President Garner went to Shanghai. It was during this time that Wang Jingwei, in Chiang’s government, and another pro-Japanese figure, Tang Youren (Wang's Deputy Foreign Minister when he was concurrently Foreign Minister), were assassinated. In December, Secretary of State Hull publicly stated: "The United States cannot turn a blind eye to the North China Autonomous Movement" (Note: Tian Jiaying: Chronology of Major Events Since the Republic of China). Through Chiang Kai-shek, in the name of the Fifth Plenary Session of the First Central Committee of the Kuomintang, administrative personnel of the Nanjing government were transferred. Chiang personally replaced Wang Jingwei as President of the Executive Yuan, conducting a large-scale purge of pro-Japanese factions (Among the ministers, only Gu Mengyu, a member of Wang's faction, remained; the rest were Chiang's confidants and key figures in the Political Science clique), giving the United States an overwhelming advantage in the Nanjing government. At the same time, however, it transported large quantities of munitions and military supplies to Japan. In 1936 alone, the value of Japanese military supplies amounted to as much as $15 million (Note: Xie Renzhao: American Foreign Policy, Fifty's Publishing House, p. 23). In December 1935, the U.S. government also exchanged views with Japanese diplomatic authorities on the issue of anti-Sovietism through the embassy in Tokyo. The reply from Japan was: "Russians are dreamers and should never be taken seriously." (Note: U.S. White Paper.)
    In these two years, the United States' struggle against Britain did not decrease due to some cooperation against Japan. The previously mentioned U.S. silver policy, once rigorously implemented, resulted in a massive outflow of silver from China. In Shanghai alone, over six million yuan of silver was lost in just two and a half months at the end of 1934, causing deflation, a sharp drop in prices, and a more severe crisis in industry and commerce, forcing China to abandon the silver standard. Japan, in January 1935, proposed the so-called "Sino-Japanese Economic Cooperation" to counter the U.S. policy. Britain, in June of the same year, sent British government financial advisor Sir Frederick Leith-Ross to China. After some processes, the Chinese currency was linked to the pound sterling bloc, supporting the Chiang government's implementation of "currency reform" in November of the same year, and announced the nationalization of silver. China's abandonment of the silver standard was originally within the expectations of the U.S. when it formulated the silver policy, but China's entry into the pound sterling bloc was completely unexpected. The hope that the United States had been trying to achieve since 1933 by continuously raising silver prices was completely dashed. In December, the U.S. government stopped purchasing silver and turned around to lower silver prices, giving the new Chinese currency system—and also Britain—a heavy blow. At the same time, it engaged in secret negotiations with Britain and the Chiang government: only on the condition of dividing Chinese monetary power equally would the United States take measures to support the new currency system. In the end, Britain yielded, and the negotiations succeeded. In May 1936, the U.S. government and Chiang Kai-shek's representative, Chen Guangfu, signed the Sino-American Silver Agreement in Washington. The United States then turned around again and stipulated that the Treasury Department would re-purchase 50 million ounces of silver from China at a price of 50 cents per ounce, using the proceeds from the sale to maintain the current price of Chiang's currency in the exchange market. At this point, the United States' fierce struggle to seize control of China's currency had achieved initial success (Note: See Zheng Yungong and Dasheng's articles in Oriental Magazine, Vol. 31, No. 8, as well as Yang Yinpu's article in Vol. 32, No. 20, and Li Yingzhao's article in No. 33 of the same magazine).
    By early 1937, the United States was still using Britain's gradually active policy toward Japan to defend against Japan, while it itself observed and evaded, unwilling to contribute. For example, on January 4th of that year, the Shanghai-based North China Daily News, a newspaper run by the British government, published an editorial openly advocating cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. In February, the British government sent Butterick to China to negotiate investment, and in March, it sent Rogers and others to assist the Chiang government in reorganizing the "Central Bank." Negotiations with Japan on establishing an "Anglo-Japanese Understanding" were suspended in April and May... The United States only sent Exports-Imports Bank President Piwenson to China in March to invest according to British methods, and completed direct air flights between the United States and China in April. Beyond that, no other effective activity was undertaken. However, it continued to export cars, oil, "scrap iron," and other military materials to Japan, providing more than half of the money and arms that Japan used to launch the war.
    The Japanese aggressors, having been cultivated by the United States for so long, became even more insane and launched a full-scale attack on China on July 7th of that year. The great anti-Japanese national liberation war of the Chinese people broke out. After the war began, the U.S. government showed no sympathy for China, maintaining a "quiet observation, silence, and patience attitude." It wasn't until July 16th that Secretary of State Hull issued a "Sixteen Principles of Peace" declaration to 62 countries around the world, listing vague phrases such as "maintaining peace," "adhering to international agreements," "promoting global economic security...," "limitations and reductions of armaments" (Note: U.S. White Paper), without a single word of condemnation of Japan, and winning the Japanese government's reply of "agreement."

　　美国侵华史
    刘大年
  　三　争夺中国霸权　（续二十一）
    蒋家发言人此时即宣布：“剿共军事完成总攻准备，将利用飞机轰炸。”（注：东方杂志三○卷二二号。）美国为进一步指挥蒋介石作战，又在此前后与蒋全面军事合作，由蒋介石召集庐山会议，通过一个军备扩张计划，总经费为五亿元。计划中除以三年为期，作为美国海军准备于一九三六年压倒日本海军计划的一部分外（注：外交月报三卷五期载日人吉冈文六通讯），又以大批美国军人参加德国人赛克特为首的“军事顾问团”，专门研究和讲授“剿共”军事。蒋介石对中国人民红军的所谓“第五次围剿”，就是在美国这样布置下进行的。
    同年，美国政府还针对中国是全世界银本位国中最主要的国家，规定一种白银政策，要在四年内，每年购银二千四百四十二万一千四百零十盎斯，来提高银价，争夺中国货币领导权，并加强美国与英日在中国的经济斗争（注：参看东方杂志第三一卷八号）。引起英日为首的外侨公会斥责美国此举为“实现银集团统制中国市场之企图，不仅扰乱中国币制，实亦威胁各国在华金融商务”（注：达生：提高银价与列强在华利益冲突，见同上志。）。也就在同时，美国又经过“国联”与英国在中国进行技术合作，把英日两国分化一下。
    一九三四年二三月间，赫尔与日本外相广田宏毅作亲善换文，表示“本政府将本友好之精神，……研究日本之处境”（注：美国白皮书），鼓励日本向苏联前进。及同年四月十七日，日本为进攻中国寻找新的借口，发表独占中国，并指责英美的所谓天羽声明，同月二十五日驻日英使林德莱也告诉广田：倘天羽声明目的是反对他国帮助中国抗日，则请日本放心，“英政府决无此意”。赫尔又赶紧训令驻日大使格鲁于同月二十九日以照会一件送交日本外相，对日政府的声明加以反对。但仍给日本指出一条路子，即美国愿“适当顾及”日本利益，只要日本不妨害美国在中国的主要权利（注：同上书）。
    不久美国又发起一个“退出中国”宣传运动，由远东问题专家别逊发表太平洋的新局势，谓美国有三个可能，第二个是在太平洋总退却。纽约论坛名记者李普曼著英国与美国一文，说“美国在远东利益不及英国六分之一……”。史汀生亦发表远东的危机，把日本向中国进攻的责任付诸英国不能合作对日，不消说这一运动的作用，仍是美国要离间英日关系，威胁英国以为己用。
    一九三四年十月，中国红军主力北上抗日，一九三五年十月到达陕北，抗日高潮震动全国。日本直到这时，仍没有如美国盼望的去进攻苏联，而是接连几次发动所谓“华北事变”，蒋介石也表现出有完全变成日本走狗的可能，美国却仍执行着它的既定政策。既于一九三五年三月，在英国提议下，决定英美对华财政联合行动，四月，派“经济考察团”来华，十一月初派副总统迦纳到上海，就在这时，蒋政府中的汪精卫及另一个亲日派头子唐有壬（汪兼外长时的外交次长）被刺。十二月国务卿赫尔又公开声明：“美国对于华北自治运动不能熟视无睹”（注：田家英：民国以来大事年表），并通过蒋介石用国民党五届一中全会名义调动南京政府行政人员，蒋亲自接替汪精卫为行政院长，对亲日派大肆清洗（各部长中存留汪派仅顾孟余一人，余多为蒋亲信及政学系要角）使美国在南京政府占得压倒优势；但同时又向日本输送大批军火与军需原料，仅一九三六年一年，而日军需品即值一千五百万美金之多（注；谢仁钊：美国外交政策，五十年代出版社，二三页）。一九三五年十二月美政府还由驻东京使馆与日本外交当局交换反苏问题的意见，所得日本的答复是“俄国人是梦想者，永远不必予以重视。”（注：美国白皮书。）
    美国对英国在这两年中，也并未因某些合作对日从而使斗争减少。前面提到过的美国白银政策，厉行结果，中国白银大量外流，仅一九三四年年底两个半月中，上海一地即丧失白银六百万元之多，造成通货紧缩，物价大跌，工商业危机更加严重，逼使中国非放弃银本位不可。日本方面于一九三五年一月提出所谓“中日经济提携”与美国政策对抗。英国则于同年六月派英政府财政顾问李滋罗斯来华，经过一些过程完成了中国货币与英镑集团的连系，支持蒋政府于同年十一月实行“币制改革”，公布白银国有令。中国放弃银本位，原不出美国制定白银政策时所料，但中国竟因此走入英镑集团，却为美国初料所万不及，美国从一九三三年起一直提高银价所要达到的希望，完全落空。十二月间，美政府停止购银，翻过来压低银价，给中国新币制——也是给英国一个沉重打击，同时又与英国及蒋政府作秘密谈判：只有以平分中国货币权为条件，美国才采取办法对新币制加以支持。到底英国退让，谈判成功，一九三六年五月，美政府与蒋介石代表陈光甫在华盛顿签订中美白银协定，美国再翻过去，规定由财政部重新向中国购买白银五千万盎斯，一盎斯作价美金五角，以卖价所得，在兑汇市场上维持蒋币的现行价格。至此，美国夺取中国货币领导权的一场剧烈斗争，遂获得初步成功（注：参看东方杂志三一卷八号郑允恭与达生文及同前志三二卷二○号杨荫溥文三三号李应兆文。）
    到一九三七年初，美国还只是利用英国的逐渐积极对日政策去防御日本，它本身则观望躲闪不肯出力。如这一年一月四日英政府在上海的机关报字林西报发表社论，公开主张国共合作，二月英政府派巴特利克来华接洽投资，三月又派罗杰士等协助蒋政府改组“中央银行”，四五月间停顿与日本关于成立“英日谅解”的谈判……。美国则只在三月间派输出入银行总理丕文森来华依照英国办法投资，及四月完成中美直接通航，此外没有作别的任何有效活动。而对于日本则继续输出汽车、石油、“废铁”及其他军用物资，供给了日本借以发动战争的全部钱财军火的半数以上。
    日本侵略者方面，因得到美国这样长期大力栽培，变得更加疯狂，于是年七月七日发动全面向中国进攻。中国人民伟大的抗日民族解放战争爆发。战争打响后，美政府毫无同情中国表示，一直“保持静观、沉默、忍耐态度”，至同月十六日，国务卿赫尔才向世界六十二国发表“和平原则十六条”声明，列举了些“维持和平”，“信守国际协定”，“促进世界之经济安全……”，“军备之限制与裁减”（注：美国白皮书）。等空泛词句，没有一字指责日本，且博得日政府覆牒“赞同”。
