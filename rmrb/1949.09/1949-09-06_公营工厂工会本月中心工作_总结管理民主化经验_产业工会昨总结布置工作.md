[This City News] The Preparatory Committee of the Beijing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions Industrial Union yesterday (5th) convened heads of trade unions from various public factories in Beijing to summarize work in August and deploy work for September.

The work for September includes: (1) The central focus is to summarize preliminary experiences in democratic factory management. Factories that have already implemented democratic management should continue to complete the work and conduct serious summaries. The summary content should include: (1) Checking the simplistic welfare viewpoint and tailism in cadres' thinking. (2) Checking the relationship between the Party, government, and trade union, especially the trade union's proactive cooperation with the Party and government. (3) Conducting detailed investigations and research on the internal workings of the factory and the temporary worker representative meetings. For units that have not yet implemented democratic management, thorough preparation must be made, starting with detailed investigation and research before beginning this work. (2) Regarding production and conservation, trade union cadres must recognize that this is the regular central work of the trade union from now on and must be vigorously carried out. (3) Summarize the experiences of various tasks and compile statistics by the 20th, reporting to the Industrial Union, in order to formally establish the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions in October. (4) Launch internationalist education among workers to welcome the Asian-Australian Trade Union Representatives Conference to be held in Beijing in November, and to coordinate with the needs of future production and construction. (5) Implement the resolutions of the All-Circles Representatives Conference and continue to eliminate counter-revolutionary secret agents.

The central work in August was democratic factory management. The main units that carried out this work were the Trolley Bus Company, People's Printing Factory, Beijing Postal Administration, and the 70th Ordnance Factory. Experience has proven that the situation must be clearly analyzed, especially not neglecting the residual influence of the Kuomintang reactionaries and the backward thinking of individual workers. Problems raised by the masses that should and can be solved should be resolved before the worker representative meeting; clear explanations should be given for problems that cannot be solved; and improper opinions should be criticized and corrected in a timely manner to promote the rise of righteous spirit. The content of the representative meeting discussion should strive to solve only one or two prepared problems at a time, and organize a strong and unified leadership core. Democratic factory management is a matter of how to combine leadership with the masses; opposing bureaucracy requires opposing the simplistic welfare viewpoint and ultra-democracy. In addition, the other main tasks in August were: (1) Handling unemployed coal miners. (2) Launching production and conservation work. The Beijing Clothing Factory, Qinghe Woolen Mill, Liulihe Cement Factory, Waterworks Company, and Yanjing Paper Mill have made significant achievements in this area. (3) Reorganizing trade union organizations. Units under the Construction Bureau have begun rectification and are preparing to re-elect the trade union. The Beijing Machine Factory is also preparing to establish a unified Federation of Trade Unions. (4) The Labor Insurance and Welfare Department has arranged for 2,000 children of employees to enter school. The Propaganda Department is also handling the registration of out-of-school children of employees for middle school.

　　公营工厂工会本月中心工作
  　总结管理民主化经验
    产业工会昨总结布置工作
    【本市讯】北平市职工总会筹委会产业工会昨（五）日召集北平市各公营工厂工会负责人总结八月份工作，布置九月份工作。
    九月份的工作，（一）中心是总结工厂管理民主化的初步经验。已进行管理民主化的各厂，应继续完成工作，并认真的总结，总结内容要包括：（１）检查干部思想中的单纯福利观点与尾巴主义思想。（２）检查党政工关系，特别是工会主动与党政配合的情况。（３）对工厂内部及临时职工代表会进行详细的调查研究。至于现在还没有进行管理民主化的单位，必须有充分准备，首先要有详细的调查研究后，再开始这项工作。（二）生产节约方面，工会干部必须认清这是今后工会的经常的中心工作，必须大力进行。（三）二十日以前总结出各项工作的经验，统计出各项数字，报告产业工会，以便在十月里正式成立市总工会。（四）在职工中展开国际主义教育，以迎接十一月在平召开的亚澳职工代表大会，并配合今后生产建设的需要。（五）贯彻各界代表会议决议，继续肃清反革命特务分子。
    八月份的工作，中心是工厂管理民主化，开展这一工作的主要单位有电车公司、人民印刷厂、北平邮政管理局和七十兵工厂。经验证明，必须将情况分析清楚，特别是不要忽视国民党反动派的残余影响与个别工人的落后的思想。群众所提出的应该而可能解决的问题，应在职工代表会之前即予解决；对不能解决的问题，要进行明确的解释；对不正当的意见，应即时给以批评纠正，促使正气上升。代表会讨论的内容应力求一次只解决一两个有准备的问题，并组织坚强的统一的领导核心。工厂管理民主化是如何使领导与群众结合的问题，反对官僚主义同时就必须反对单纯福利观点与极端民主化的思想。此外，八月份的其他主要工作是：（一）处理失业煤矿工人。（二）展开生产节约工作。北平被服厂、清河制呢厂、琉璃河水泥厂、自来水公司、燕京造纸厂在这方面都有显著的成绩。（三）整理工会组织，建设局所属单位已开始整顿，并准备改选工会。北平机器厂也准备成立统一的职工总会。（四）劳保福利部办妥了二千职工子弟入学。宣教部也在办理职工中学失学子弟登记。
