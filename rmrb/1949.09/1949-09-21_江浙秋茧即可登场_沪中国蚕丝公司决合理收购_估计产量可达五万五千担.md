[Shanghai News] Autumn cocoons in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces will soon arrive on the market around the 24th and 25th of this month. In order to promote foreign sales and develop the rural economy, the China Silk Company has decided to make reasonable acquisitions.

Regarding the silk industry in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, due to the reactionary Kuomintang clique's reliance on American imperialism, foreign rayon has been dumped in large quantities in recent years. Moreover, when cocoons came on the market, the bandit gangs forcibly purchased them, causing great suffering to our country's silkworm farmers. Since liberation, the blockade of seaports has obstructed silk exports, leading to a sharp decline in cocoon prices. In order to take care of the interests of silkworm farmers, the East China Trade Department, in view of the mistakes of the reactionary faction's acquisition policies in the past, has decided that the purchase price of autumn cocoons will be calculated at about 2.3 shi of medium-quality rice per dan of fresh cocoons, and paid in cash or rice according to the local market price of rice at that time. As for the acquisition agencies, the government will directly entrust local cocoon firms to handle the acquisitions. About 70 or 80 firms in Jiangsu Province will handle this, while in Zhejiang Province, the local product company will undertake it.

It is reported that the climate in the Jiangnan region this year is suitable for the development of autumn silkworms. It is estimated that the output of autumn cocoons will be 15,000 dan in Zhejiang Province and 40,000 dan in Jiangsu Province, with a total output of about 55,000 dan in the two provinces.

In order to support the resumption of work in silk mills, China Silk Company has formulated measures for entrusted reeling and has signed contracts with Shanghai Dali Silk Mill, Zhejiang Zhongsi No. 1 Mill, Chongyu Silk Mill, Wuxi Huachang Silk Mill, Hongfeng Silk Mill, Suzhou Zhongcan No. 1 Silk Mill, and Xinhua Silk Mill to exchange silk for cocoons. With the strong support of the authorities, all contracted silk mills have started production. It is reported that all silk mills in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, regardless of whether they enjoy entrusted reeling rights or not, can sign contracts with China Silk Company to undertake reeling.

　　江浙秋茧即可登场
  　沪中国蚕丝公司决合理收购
    估计产量可达五万五千担
    【上海讯】江浙两省秋茧将在本月二十四、五日登场，中国蚕丝公司为推广外销并发展农村经济，决予合理收购。
    按江浙蚕丝事业，由于国民党反动派投靠美帝，年来外国人造丝大量倾销，而在蚕茧登场时匪帮又强制收购，使我国蚕农生活饱受痛苦。解放以来，封锁海口，蚕丝外销受阻，茧价下跌甚剧。华东贸易部为照顾蚕农利益，鉴于过去反动派收购政策之错误，秋茧收价决定每担鲜茧以中等米二石三斗左右计算，参照当地当时市场米价折付现款或食米。至收购机构，将由政府直接委托各地茧行，江苏省办理的有七、八十家，浙省则由土产公司承办。
    据悉：今年江南气候，适宜秋蚕发育，估计秋茧产量，浙江省可产一万五千担，江苏省可产四万担，江浙两省产量总数约五万五千担。
    中蚕公司并为了扶植丝厂复工起见，制订代缫办法，已与本市大利丝厂，浙江中丝一厂，崇裕丝厂，无锡华昌丝厂，鸿丰丝厂，苏州中蚕第一丝厂，新华丝厂，签订以丝易茧合约。在当局大力扶植之下，签约各丝厂，都已开工生产。据悉：凡苏浙丝厂，不论享有代缫权否，都可向中蚕公司订约承缫。
