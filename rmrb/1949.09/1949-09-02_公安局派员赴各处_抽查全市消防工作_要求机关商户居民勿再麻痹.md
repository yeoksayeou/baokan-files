The Public Security Bureau Dispatches Personnel to Various Locations
　　Conduct Spot Checks on Citywide Fire Safety Work
　　Urging Agencies, Businesses, and Residents to Avoid Complacency
　　[Our Newspaper] Following the fire safety conference held by the Ping City Public Security Bureau on July 20th for various public and private enterprises, agencies, organizations, and entertainment venues, the bureau recently dispatched dedicated personnel to form inspection teams. They were sent to various locations to inspect fire safety work, checking thirty public and private enterprises, twenty-one entertainment venues, twenty-one shops, and one hundred seventy-one households. The inspections revealed that after the previous meeting, responsible comrades from various units had carefully conveyed the information back to their units, convening all staff for discussions. The majority of public and private enterprises, from leaders to workers, had a considerable understanding of factory protection work, especially the workers who were more actively involved in safeguarding factory safety. They had also purchased various fire extinguishing equipment such as fire extinguishers, water tanks, sand, and fire hoses. Fire safety organizations had been established. Some units had unified the fire safety organization with the workers' protection team, not only taking on fire prevention duties but also conducting counter-espionage work simultaneously, which is an excellent organizational approach.
　　However, many units still do not meet fire safety construction standards, and individual units still harbor complacent thoughts such as "no accidents will occur" or "there is an army, so there won't be any problems." Some public factories only add fire extinguishers without paying attention to the repair and addition of other fire extinguishing tools. Worn-out electrical wiring is a common phenomenon, and it is necessary to suggest that the electric company replace wiring in critical areas and places prone to fire hazards.
　　In addition, many shops and households pay very little attention to fire safety work. For example, at No. 7, West Mounting Alley, Inner District 1, where fourteen households reside, the internal electrical wiring is old and messy. A stove is placed on the floor downstairs without an iron plate for insulation. A pile of sorghum stalks is piled in the yard, and two electrical wires are led from the outside power pole to the backyard, wrapped around a tree, exposing the bare wire ends. The only fire safety equipment is a water dragon, without water tanks, sand, or other items. At No. 121 Qianwai Street, Fusheng Kerosene Sundries Store, there is only one Taiping water tank in the store, without sand or fire extinguishers that are effective for extinguishing oil fires. There is no fire safety equipment at all in twenty-six households including No. 12 and No. 17 Baozi Street. In order to protect the lives and property of the people of the city from accidental losses, the Public Security Bureau once again urges all public and private enterprises, agencies, organizations, entertainment venues, shops, and households to pay attention.

### 公安局派员赴各处　抽查全市消防工作　要求机关商户居民勿再麻痹

　　公安局派员赴各处
  　抽查全市消防工作
  　要求机关商户居民勿再麻痹
    【本报讯】平市公安局继七月二十日召开之各公私营企业，机关团体及娱乐场所消防大会后，于日前特派专人组织起检查组。分赴各处检查消防工作。计检查公私营企业三十处，娱乐场所二十一处，铺户二十一处，住户一百七十一处。检查中发现：自上次会后，各单位负责同志，回到本单位均已仔细传达，召集全体职工人员进行讨论。大部分公私营企业，从领导者到工人对护厂工作均已有了相当认识，尤其是工人们对保卫工厂安全更为积极。并已置买了各种消火设备如消火器、水缸、沙土、水龙带等。消防组织均已建立。有的单位把消防组织与保工队统一起来，不仅担负防火，而且还同时进行反特工作，这种组织方式很好。
    但是还有很多单位不符合消防建设标准，个别单位还有“绝无意外”或“有军队，不会发生问题”的麻痹想法。有的公营工厂只添设消火器而不注意其他的消火工具之修理与增设。电线残破是普遍现象，需要建议电业公司在紧要处、容易滋火的地方加以更换。
    另外很多铺户与住户对消防工作极不注意。如内一区西裱褙胡同七号住有十四户，内部电灯线均已朽旧，非常零乱，在楼下地板上放置一个火炉，炉下也没铁板隔离，院中堆有一堆秫秸，后院从外面电杆上引进电线两根，绕在树上，露着两根线头，消防设备只有一个水龙，其他如水缸、沙土等均没有。前外大街一二一号福生煤油杂货庄，铺中只有一个太平水缸，而对于消灭油类火焰有效的沙土、灭火器等全没有。报子街十二号及十七号等二十六户中，一点消防设备也没有。公安局为使全市人民生命财产免受意外损失，特再度提请各公私营企业机关团体，娱乐场所、铺户、住户注意。　　　　　　　　　　　　　（光）
