　　Chiang Regime Strangled Education in Southwest China
    Zhu Ping
    The education in Southwest China has already been strangled by the evil hands of the Kuomintang reactionaries.
    Under the circumstances of economic disintegration, military collapse, and political paralysis of the pseudo-government, the bankruptcy of education was also evident. Let's take the strikes and teacher respect movements that spread across Sichuan, Kang, Yunnan, and Guizhou in April, May, and June as examples:
    The pseudo-government made one "economic reform" on the left and another "currency reform" on the right. Each different reform was an opportunity for them to plunder. Bundles and boxes of gold yuan notes and silver yuan notes went to the market, but public school teachers and staff still couldn't receive their salaries for two or three months. On the other hand, they hoarded gold, silver, valuables, and daily necessities in large and small warehouses. As a result, the rice, food, and clothing in the hands of workers, farmers, civil servants, and teachers were all swindled away by them. Every family was worried about the problem of eating. In order to eat, the children of university professors could not go to school and had to pick up firewood for cooking. In order to let their children go to school, some professors had their gold teeth pulled out. Teachers in primary and secondary schools, for the sake of their livelihood, launched an unprecedented strike "total leave" movement. This movement not only occurred in several major cities such as Chengdu, Kunming, Guiyang, and Chongqing, but also spread to every county, town, and township.
    Since teachers did not attend classes, the students were naturally anxious. The student strike movement and the teacher respect movement also unfolded vigorously. From a developmental perspective, the teacher respect movement coordinated with the strike movement, first in one school, then in one region, then several schools joined together, and finally, in mid-April, there was a teacher respect movement by students throughout Chongqing. The students carried newspapers, stationery, and daily necessities that they had raised, and sold and fundraised for charity from pedestrians and customers on the streets, in teahouses, restaurants, and coffee shops. At the same time, they petitioned the pseudo-"Chief Executive Office" to demand the protection of education and the improvement of teachers' lives. Needless to say, this would not yield any results. In order to realize their demands, the students in Chongqing decided to march again on April 21.
    In order to suppress this march, the pseudo-government's defeated "general" Luo Guangwen mobilized the remnants of his 44th and 76th armies, the demon king Yang Sen was on guard with his privately accumulated secret service regiments, and Liu Yuqing and Sha Jifu also took out their police and constabulary. Secret agents, local bullies, and hooligans were all summoned, with lines of machine gun positions and lines of cordon. In this way, martial law was imposed on the city for two days, water traffic was cut off for one day, and large-scale arrests and killings were carried out.
    Although the reactionaries were so vigilant and used intimidation, bribery, and alienation against the students, the students' unity became even stronger. Although the march failed to be achieved, they held marches or seminars in different districts, finally achieving the purpose of educating themselves. They used this movement to: 1. popularize the folk Yangko dance and recitation art, using realistic content to express it in the form of allegro or cheerleading; 2. improve the political awareness and cultural level of the masses through practice; 3. shorten the boundaries between intellectuals and laboring workers and peasants. The teacher respect "want to live" movement also absorbed some school workers, which are some unprecedented achievements.
    In Chengdu and Chongqing, Wang Lingji, the pseudo-provincial chairman of Sichuan Province, was afraid of student unrest in the next semester, so he ordered the provincial middle schools to temporarily suspend classes for half a year. In fact, the pseudo-Chongqing Municipal Government had financial difficulties and could not solve the problem of education funding. Whether to suspend or run schools was still unknown. For example, the old principal of Municipal No. 1 Middle School has not been appointed a new principal after being arrested; the funding for Municipal No. 2 Middle School has been provided by the pseudo-Ministry of Education in the past, but this year there is no funding; Li Hongming, the principal of Municipal Girls' Middle School, is still unable to decide whether to retain teachers and whether the school will open. Among private middle schools, only Tsinghua and Nankai are still recruiting new students, but few students have the strength to continue their studies. Only the children of bureaucrats and landlords have the strength to go to school, and to go to school abroad.
    Sichuan University and Chongqing University have been living on loans for three or four months. For the sake of funding, President Zhang Hongyuan is still running between Hong Kong and Guangzhou.

　　蒋政权扼死了西南教育
    祝平
    西南的教育事业，已经在国民党反动政府的魔手下扼死了。
    伪政府在经济瓦解、军事崩溃、政治瘫痪的情况下，也表现了教育的破产，就以四、五、六月份川、康、云、贵、漫布的罢教、尊师运动作例吧：
    伪政府左一个“经济改革”，右一个“货币改革”，每个不同的改革都是他们掠夺的机会，大把大把成捆成箱的金元券呀，银元券呀往市场上去，但公教人员两三个月仍领不到薪资。另一方面，金银财帛，生活日用物资呀，他们就大仓小仓的囤。于是工人、农民、公务员、教职员们手中的米粮衣物，都被他们骗夺去了。每个家庭都在发愁着吃饭问题。为了吃饭，大学教授的子女也不能读书，必须去拾烧饭柴。为了让子女去读书，有些教授先生拔掉金牙。大中小学的教书先生为着生活，于是展开了空前的罢教“总请假”运动。这个运动不仅发生在成都、昆明、贵阳、重庆等几个大都市，而且普及到每个县镇乡镇。
    教书先生不上课，学生自然着急，学生的罢课运动和尊师运动也就如火如荼地展开了。就发展上看，尊师运动配合着罢教运动，先是一个学校一个学校的，继而一个地区一个地区的，再而几个学校几个学校的联合在一起举行，终至在四月中旬来了一次重庆全市学生的尊师运动。学生们带着募来的报纸、文具、日常用品，在街上、在茶馆、饭店、在咖啡厅向行人顾客义卖并募捐，同时向伪“长官公署”请愿，要求保障教育及改善教师生活。不消说，这是不会有结果的，重庆学生为着实现要求，于是决定四月二十一日再游行。
    伪政府为了镇压这次游行，败“将”罗广文动员了他的四十四军七十六军残余部队，魔王杨森戒备了他的私蓄特务团，刘雨卿、沙吉夫也拿出了他们的警宪，特工、地痞、流氓都被召来了，一道一道的机关枪阵地，一道一道的警戒线。就这样地，全市戒严两天，水上交通断绝一天，进行大逮捕、大打杀。
    虽然反动者如此戒备，并对学生们施以恫吓、收买、离间，但学生们的团结却越发坚强了。虽然游行未能达成，但他们分区举行了游行或座谈，终于达到教育自己的目的。他们利用这个运动，一、将民间秧歌的舞诵艺术推广了，利用现实内容，以快板或啦啦的形式表现出来；二、通过了实践提高了群众的政治认识和文化水平；三、将知识分子和劳动工农间的界限缩短了，尊师“要生活”运动，将部分学校工友也吸收进去，这是前所未有的一些成就。
    在蓉渝两地，四川省伪省主席王陵基，因为怕下学期发生学潮，曾下令省立中学暂时停办半年；而事实上伪重庆市府财政困难，没办法解决教育经费问题，停或办乃在未知之数。如市一中旧校长被逮捕后未任命新校长；市二中经费向由伪教育部发给，今年却无着落；市女中校长李鸿明对师长之留聘及学校开课与否也仍无法决定；私立中学只有清华、南开还招考新生，但学生能有力量续学的，怕没有几人，只有官僚、地主的子女才有力量上学，并且到国外上学。
    川大、重大三四个月是以借债度日。为了经费问题，校长张洪沅至今还奔波于港穗之间。
