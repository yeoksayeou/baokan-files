    [Datong News] In order to gradually unify the market currency and facilitate transactions for merchants and the people, the Datong Office of the People's Bank of China decided to start recovering various old currencies from September 5th. Three specific recovery methods were stipulated: (1) The old currencies to be recovered include Jinan notes (including fixed-amount promissory notes), border currency (including those with the characters "Ji Re Liao"), Beihai currency, and Northwest Farmer's and Shaanxi Trade Coupons; (2) In addition to the exchange offices in Zuoyun, Youyu, Pinglu, Yingxian, Guangling, Lingqiu, and Tianzhen, which are specifically responsible for the recovery, the Datong Office and the branches of each county will also recover the currency simultaneously; (3) During the recovery period, all kinds of old currencies are still allowed to circulate, and the direct exchange will continue until the last note, at which point this work will be concluded. The office instructed each branch exchange to conscientiously carry out this recovery work, quickly clarify the market currency, and proceed with the recovery without worrying about the shortage of cadres or insufficient funds, and should strengthen the sense of responsibility, and strictly protect the state's assets. At the same time, it used meetings to publicize everywhere and entrusted private firms, cooperatives, etc., to carry out the recovery. The office also printed 1,000 copies of a notice, distributed them for posting in various places, and expanded publicity.
