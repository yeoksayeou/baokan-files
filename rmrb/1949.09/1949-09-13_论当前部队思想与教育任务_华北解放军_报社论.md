Editor's Note: This article is an editorial from the "North China People's Liberation Army," a newspaper published by the Political Department of the North China Military Region. Because some of the ideological issues discussed also exist, similarly or identically, among a portion of cadres and staff outside the military, it has been slightly modified and reprinted here.

We are soon to achieve nationwide victory. As early as February of this year, Chairman Mao pointed out: "To win country-wide victory is only the first step in a long march of ten thousand li." "Within the historical period in which classes have not been eliminated at home and imperialism still exists abroad, our army is still a fighting force; on this point there should be no misunderstanding or wavering." Chairman Mao's assessment of the nationwide victory of the revolutionary war and its place in the historical process of the Chinese people's liberation cause, and his instructions regarding the basic tasks of the Chinese People's Liberation Army in the coming historical period, are the fundamental guidelines for our current ideological construction of the troops.

The current ideological situation in the troops shows that Chairman Mao's extremely important instructions have not been well implemented. The following ideological sentiments are fairly widespread in the troops: First, the belief that North China is completely liberated, and the war will soon be over throughout the country, so it is time to demobilize. Second, the idea that the troops will eventually be "disbanded," so it is better to change professions sooner rather than later. Third, after entering the cities, corrupt and enjoyment-seeking thoughts have greatly increased. These ideological sentiments clearly conflict with Chairman Mao's thought. Without fundamentally resolving these ideological problems, it will be impossible to carry out the regular construction of the army normally.

Tracing the class roots of the above ideological manifestations, they basically come from the peasant class, and also partly from the petty-bourgeois intellectuals and the influence of the decadent exploiting classes. In other words, these ideological sentiments are a reflection of non-proletarian ideology within our army.

We must pay attention to the fact that the members of our army are basically from the peasantry, and "the serious problem is the education of the peasantry." Although peasants have joined the People's Liberation Army, and are under the direct leadership and education of the proletarian vanguard Communist Party, and have undergone the highly organized and disciplined military life and combat training of the collective, they are different from the scattered individual peasants, but this does not weaken the seriousness of the army's educational tasks. The seriousness of the educational task lies in constantly transforming the small-producer ideology brought by their class, raising their level of consciousness, and making them firmly believe that only by following the proletariat and its vanguard, the Communist Party, consolidating the worker-peasant alliance, and moving towards socialism and communism, can they achieve final and complete liberation.

The Party's general line is the general basis for the army's class education. Because the Party's general line correctly solved the Chinese peasant problem, it enabled the vast number of awakened peasants to participate in the ranks of heroic combat, and the army's class education is based on this foundation. It strengthened their fighting will, promoted their courageous spirit, overcame countless twists and turns and dangers, and led the revolutionary war to victory. The education we have carried out against imperialism (opposing Japanese fascism and American imperialism), against feudalism (land reform and venting grievances), and against bureaucratic capitalism (opposing the Kuomintang reactionaries) has been successful. This is especially reflected in the great actions of the 25,000-li Long March and the southward march to Jiangnan. Without the deep-going class education, it would have been almost impossible to make the peasants leave their hometowns and carry the revolutionary war to the end. But today, nationwide victory is soon to be achieved, that is to say, the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang is about to come to an end throughout the country, the aggressive forces of imperialism are about to be driven out of China, and the landlord class has been eliminated in some areas, and in other areas, land reform will be implemented in the next few years to eliminate the landlord class. The reactionary forces that cruelly ruled and exploited the peasants in the past have been or are about to be overthrown from the peasants' heads, and the peasants' land problem has been or will be solved. Under such circumstances, the peasants' ideological sentiment is that the great task has been accomplished. As a democratic class of peasants, this idea is very natural; and the reflection of this ideological sentiment within the army is the thought of demobilization (among some soldiers and junior cadres), and the thought of changing professions (among some cadres who have been away from production for a long time).

We must educate comrades with such thoughts: According to Chairman Mao's instructions, the Chinese revolution has three main experiences: "A disciplined party armed with the theory of Marxism-Leninism, using the method of self-criticism and linked with the masses of the people; an army led by such a party; a united front of all revolutionary classes and revolutionary factions led by such a party." If any one of these three major issues makes a mistake, the Chinese revolution will suffer setbacks and failures. Whether our army makes mistakes at present and in the future, the basic key lies in whether the idea of "always being a fighting force" can be thoroughly implemented. The reason is very clear, we must never think that driving imperialism out of China is the end of all our troubles. Imperialism hates the people's revolutionary movement, and the people of the world must oppose imperialism in order to defend lasting peace, until the system of imperialism is eliminated worldwide; the reactionary remnants at home are not reconciled to death and are always trying to stage a comeback, and the Chinese people must thoroughly eliminate the reactionary remnants; classes exist at home, and there are complex struggles to steadily and step-by-step transition to socialism. The responsibility of the Chinese people lies in ensuring the future of socialism. Our current important task is to strengthen the people's state apparatus and consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship. Therefore, our People's Liberation Army must never allow itself to disarm, but should consciously become an eternal fighting force, strengthen regular and modernized construction, and sharpen its swords. Participate in the world people's anti-imperialist front headed by the Soviet Union, and consciously and bravely undertake the great and glorious task of defending the people's victory, defending world lasting peace, and promoting the liberation of all mankind.

We must also understand that the Chinese New Democratic Revolution is a part of the world proletarian revolution. The victory of the Chinese revolution, without the success of the Russian revolution, without the victory of Soviet socialist construction, without the Soviet Union defeating the German invaders, without the Soviet Union participating in the war against Japan, and without the cooperation of the world people's revolutionary movement, is unimaginable; similarly, if we want to consolidate our gains and engage in various constructions in the future, without the assistance of the Soviet Union and the new democratic countries, and without the cooperation of the world people's revolutionary movement, it is also unimaginable. We are closely related to the proletariat of the world, the people of the world, and all oppressed nations. We must not only obtain their assistance, but also have the obligation to assist all oppressed nations and the oppressed people in imperialist countries.

We must educate comrades with such thoughts: After achieving nationwide victory, the primary task of the people's democratic dictatorship is to solve the problem of national industrialization in a step-by-step manner. Only by solving this problem can we move from new democracy to socialism. Socialism eliminates classes, and only then can the peasants achieve final and complete liberation, and agricultural laborers can enjoy a comfortable life. Because peasants cannot obtain more benefits and enjoy a comfortable life by working alone with outdated production tools, to enjoy a comfortable life, we must gradually develop from small-scale production to large-scale production, and replace outdated tools with modern tools. The happy life of the Soviet people today is our bright prospect. Therefore, we must consolidate the worker-peasant alliance, resolutely build new democracy under the leadership of the working class, and steadily and step-by-step transition to socialism. The vast number of cadres and soldiers of our People's Liberation Army mostly come from the peasant class, and are the most advanced and most conscious among the peasants, and many comrades have become Communists. We must never be satisfied with driving away the imperialist aggressors, overthrowing the Kuomintang reactionaries, and eliminating the landlord class. We should continue to struggle unremittingly for the complete liberation of the working class and the peasant class, and for the highest ideals of mankind. The weapons in our hands are precisely the indispensable force to ensure the realization of this long-term goal, and we must stand firmly at our combat posts without wavering.

This post is arduous, and we still have to temporarily endure the hardships of the transitional period. Our families, because they have been oppressed, ruled, exploited, and ravaged by imperialism, the Kuomintang reactionaries, and the landlord class for a long time, lack savings, and the labor force has been considerably reduced. We should encourage our families to work hard in production and mutual labor assistance to overcome these difficulties. Our marriage problem, because the whole environment and conditions cannot be completely resolved for a while, but this problem should be resolved in the future, and it can be resolved, we should endure it temporarily. We are glorious precisely because we can endure personal temporary hardships and difficulties for the overall and long-term interests of the people and the class.

The thought of "changing professions later is not as good as changing professions earlier" is an individualistic thought. The long revolutionary war and the characteristics of the Chinese revolutionary armed struggle have indeed concentrated a large number of outstanding cadres in the people's army. This is the need of the struggle. After achieving nationwide victory, a certain number of outstanding cadres must still be retained in the People's Liberation Army. Of course, a part of the cadres will inevitably be transferred from the army to engage in political, economic, and cultural construction. But we revolutionaries and Communists first proceed from the needs of the Party and the revolution, and our attitude towards work distribution is to obey the organization's decision. The so-called "foresight" for "personal prospects" – "changing professions later is not as good as changing professions earlier" – has nothing in common with the predictability of Marxism-Leninism. The problem lies in strengthening our study, learning Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, improving our theoretical level, and making up for our cultural and scientific knowledge. This is not only needed for political, economic, and cultural construction, but also for national defense construction.

Some comrades see that the national bourgeoisie and their representatives live well, and think that they have been revolutionaries for many years and are not as good as them, and they feel envious or resentful and are full of complaints. The emergence of this ideological sentiment shows that these comrades lack a class viewpoint, and inappropriately compare the life of the proletariat and its led army with the life of private capitalists who possess a large amount of wealth. These comrades do not understand that our hard struggle is precisely to develop the productive forces of society, so that the broad masses of the people, including ourselves, can gradually enjoy a happy life. These comrades' views also show that they do not have enough understanding of the Party's united front, and do not recognize that "the national bourgeoisie has great importance at the present stage." (Chairman Mao on People's Democratic Dictatorship) Politically speaking, we still have imperialism standing by our side, and this enemy is very fierce, and we need to unite broad revolutionary forces to fight it. Economically speaking, due to China's economic backwardness, in order to industrialize China and prepare conditions for the transition to socialism, in addition to mainly developing the people's state economy and the semi-socialist cooperative economy, we must also use all urban and rural capitalist factors that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood and not harmful. Therefore, our relationship with the national bourgeoisie – the relationship of revolutionary friends – should proceed from the Party's policy line, rather than from narrow emotions of personal likes and dislikes, so that we can seek consciousness and initiative on this issue. Consciousness and initiative are the hallmarks of class consciousness.

Some petty-bourgeois intellectuals, due to insufficient revolutionary training, often have unrealistic fantasies about the revolution, thinking that the victory of the revolutionary war and the overthrow of the rule of imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries means that everything is perfect and it is time to enjoy themselves, and in the viewpoint of enjoyment, they are often mixed with the decadent viewpoints of the exploiting classes. They do not understand that this "is only the first step in a long march of ten thousand li," and that in the coming historical period, there are still arduous tasks before us, and we still need to carry forward our hard-struggle style. Our future is beautiful and happy, and it is precisely for such a future that we must continue to maintain our hard-struggle style. Things are not achieved overnight, and happiness needs to be cultivated bit by bit with our own struggle and labor.

As for those degenerate, corrupt, and depraved thoughts and behaviors, they are only a very small minority. These thoughts and behaviors are shameful. But as long as the vast majority of comrades wake up, the righteousness of the troops rises, and criticism and self-criticism are carried out, these thoughts and behaviors can be overcome.

In summary, the current task of our troop education, in addition to carrying out the new democratic policy education, must also strengthen the communist future education and internationalist education, so that the comrades in the troops can broaden their horizons, recognize the future, break away from the circle of narrow, conservative ideas and nationalist sentiments, and truly accept Chairman Mao's instructions that "winning nationwide victory is only the first step in a long march of ten thousand li" and "always being a fighting force."

The main key to solving these ideological problems lies in the cadres. As long as the cadres' thinking is straightened out, the ideological problems of the troops will be basically solved.

The troops must engage in ideological construction from a positive aspect, that is to say, they must strengthen the theoretical study of the troop cadres. Only in this way can they overcome empiricism, strengthen the ideological leadership of the troops, enable the cadres to find the essence of the ideological reflections of the troops, and, in light of the actual ideology of the troops, establish the aspects that they lack and are insufficient, and guide them step by step, and constantly improve their class consciousness. This is an arduous work that requires great patience. Without analysis and research, being confused by the chaotic phenomena, and one-sidedly and hastily dealing with the symptoms, it is impossible to effectively solve the ideological tendencies of the troops. Establishing a work style of combining theory and practice is extremely important to us.

　　论当前部队思想与教育任务
    “华北解放军”报社论
    编者按：本文系华北军区政治部出版的部队报纸——“华北解放军”的社论。因其所论列的若干思想问题，在部队以外的一部分干部和工作人员中同样或类似地存在，故稍加修改，转载于此。
    我们很快就要取得全国胜利了。早在今年二月，毛主席就指出：“夺取全国胜利，这只是万里长征走完了第一步。”“在国内没有消灭阶级和世界上存在着帝国主义制度的历史时期内，我们军队还是一个战斗队，对于这一点不能有任何的误解和动摇。”毛主席对于革命战争取得全国胜利，在中国人民解放事业的历史进程中的估价，对于中国人民解放军在今后一个历史时期中的基本任务的指示，是我们当前部队思想建设的根本方针。
    目前部队思想情况，正说明对于毛主席这个极为重要的指示，没有很好的贯澈。部队中相当普遍的存在着以下几种思想情绪：第一，认为华北完全解放了，战争在全国范围内也很快就要结束了，因此可以复员了。第二，将来部队总是要“解散”的，与其将来转业，不如早些改行。第三，进驻城市以后，腐化、闹享受的思想大大增加。这些思想情绪，很显然是与毛主席的思想抵触的。不从根本上解决这些思想问题，就不可能正常地进行军队的正规建设。
    从以上几种思想表现，追溯它的阶级根源，是基本上来自农民阶级，此外，一部分来自小资产阶级知识分子和来自腐朽的剥削阶级的影响。也就是说，这些思想情绪，是非无产阶级思想在我们军队内的反映。
    我们必须注意，我们军队的成员，基本上来自农民，而“严重的问题是教育农民”，虽然农民参加了人民解放军，在无产阶级先锋队共产党的直接领导与教育下，经过集体的高度组织性纪律性的军队生活和战斗锻炼，是与分散的个体的农民有区别的，但并不能因此减弱军队教育任务的严重性。教育任务的严重，就在于不断改造从他们阶级带来的小生产者的思想意识，提高他们的觉悟程度，使他们坚信跟着无产阶级及其先锋队共产党，巩固工农联盟，走向社会主义共产主义，才能获得最后彻底的解放。
    党的总路线，是军队阶级教育总的依据。由于党的总路线，正确地解决了中国农民问题，使广大觉悟的农民，参加了英勇的战斗行列，而军队的阶级教育，即在这个基础之上。坚定了他们的战斗意志，发扬了他们的勇敢精神，战胜无数曲折艰险，把革命战争引向胜利。我们所进行的反帝国主义（反对日本法西斯和美帝国主义）、反封建主义（土地改革和诉苦运动）、反官僚资本主义（反对国民党反动派）的教育，是有成绩的。特别体现在二万五千里长征和南下江南的伟大行动上，没有阶级教育的深入，要使农民远离乡土，将革命战争进行到底，几乎是不可能的。但是今天很快就要取得全国胜利了，也就是说，国民党的反动统治，即将在全国范围内寿终正寝，帝国主义的侵略势力，即将被赶出中国去，一部分地区已经消灭了地主阶级，另外一部分地区，在最近几年内亦将实现土地改革消灭地主阶级，过去残酷地统治与剥削农民的反动势力，已经或即将从农民头上被推翻下去，农民的土地问题已经或将要获得解决。在这种情况下，农民的思想情绪，认为大功告成了，作为民主主义者的农民阶级，这种想法是很自然的；而这种思想情绪在军队内的反映，就是复员思想（一部分战士和初级干部），和转业思想（一部分脱离生产较久的干部）。
    我们必须教育有这类思想的同志：根据毛主席的指示，中国革命有三个主要经验，“一个有纪律的有马、恩、列、斯的理论武装的采取自我批评方法的联系人民群众的党，一个由这样党领导的军队，一个由这样党领导的各革命阶层各革命派别的统一战线。”在这三个主要问题中任何一个犯了错误，就将使中国革命遭受挫折和失败。我们军队目前和今后犯不犯错误，基本关键，就在于对“永远是一个战斗队”的思想能否深入贯彻。道理是很显然的，我们决不能以为把帝国主义赶出中国去了，就百事大吉。帝国主义在仇视人民的革命运动，世界人民为了保卫持久和平，必须反对帝国主义，直至帝国主义制度在世界范围内的消灭；国内反动残余势力不甘心死亡，时刻企图死灰复燃，中国人民必须彻底肃清反动残余；国内阶级存在，要稳健地有步骤地转变到社会主义，还有着复杂的斗争，中国人民的责任，就在于保障社会主义的前途。我们当前的重要任务，就是强化人民国家机器，巩固人民民主专政。因此我们人民解放军，就决不允许自己解除武装，而是应当自觉地成为永远的战斗队，加强正规化现代化建设，磨砺以须。参加以苏联为首的世界人民反帝国主义的阵线，自觉地、勇敢地担当保卫人民胜利，保卫世界持久和平，促进全人类解放的伟大光荣任务。
    我们还必须明白，中国新民主主义革命，是世界无产阶级革命的一部分，中国革命的胜利，没有俄国革命的成功，没有苏联社会主义建设的胜利，没有苏联打败德寇，没有苏联参加对日作战，没有世界人民革命运动的配合，是不可设想的；同样我们要巩固既得的胜利，和从事今后的各种建设，没有苏联和各新民主主义国家的援助，以及世界人民革命运动的配合，也是不可设想的。我们与全世界无产阶级、全世界人民、一切被压迫民族是休戚相关的，我们不仅要取得他们的援助，并且对于一切被压迫民族和帝国主义国家内被压迫的人民，有援助他们的义务。
    我们必须教育有这类思想的同志：在取得全国胜利之后，人民民主专政的国家的首要任务，是有步骤地解决国家工业化的问题，只有解决这个问题，才能由新民主主义到社会主义。而社会主义消灭了阶级，农民才能获得最后彻底解放，农业劳动者才能享受宽裕的生活。因为农民用陈旧的生产工具单独劳动，是不能获得更多利益，享受宽裕生活的，要享受宽裕生活，必须由小生产逐步发展为大生产，用现代化工具代替陈旧工具。苏联人民今天的幸福生活，就是我们光明的远景。因此，必须巩固工农联盟，坚决在工人阶级领导下，建设新民主主义，并稳健地有步骤地过渡到社会主义。我们人民解放军的广大干部战士，大都来自农民阶级，是农民中最先进的最觉悟的，其中很多同志并且已成为共产党员，我们决不应以赶走了帝国主义侵略势力，推翻了国民党反动派，消灭了地主阶级为满足，我们应当为了工人阶级农民阶级的彻底解放，为了人类最高的理想，而继续奋斗不懈。我们手中的武器，正是保障这个远大目标实现的不可少的力量，我们必须毫不动摇地站稳自己的战斗岗位。
    这个岗位是艰苦的，我们还不得不暂时忍受过渡时期的艰苦，我们的家庭，因为长期受着帝国主义、国民党反动派、地主阶级的压迫、统治、剥削、摧残，缺少积蓄，劳动力相当减少了，我们应当鼓励我们的家庭勤劳生产，劳动互助来战胜这些困难。我们的婚姻问题，因为整个环境与条件，一时尚无法整个解决，但是这一问题，在将来是应当解决，并且是可以解决的，我们应当暂时忍受。我们之所以光荣正是因为我们能为了人民和阶级的整体远大利益，忍受个人的暂时的艰苦困难。
    “晚改行不如早改行”的思想，是个人主义的思想。长期的革命战争与中国革命武装斗争的特点，使人民军队中确是集中了大量优秀的干部，这是斗争的需要。在取得全国胜利之后，依然要在人民解放军中保留一定数量的优秀的干部。当然也必然要从军队中抽调一部分干部，去从事政治、经济、文化各方面的建设。但我们革命者和共产党员首先从党和革命需要出发，对于工作分配的态度是服从组织决定，为了所谓“个人前途”的“远见”——“晚改行不如早改行”，是与马列主义的预见性毫无相同之点。问题倒在于加强我们的学习，学习马列主义毛泽东思想，提高理论水平，补习文化科学知识，这不仅为政治、经济、文化建设所需要，亦为国防建设所必需。
    有些同志看到民族资产阶级及其代表人物生活好，认为自己革命多少年还不如他们，心中羡慕或抱有不平，牢骚满腹。这种思想情绪的产生，说明了这些同志缺乏阶级观点，把无产阶级及其所领导的军队的生活和占有大量财富的私人资本家的生活，不恰当地加以对比，这些同志没有了解我们的艰苦奋斗，正是为着发展社会的生产力，使广大人民，连我们自己在内，都逐渐能够普遍享受美满的生活。这些同志的观点，同时也说明了他们，对于党的统一战线的认识不足，没有认识“民族资产阶级在现阶段上，有其很大的重要性。”（毛主席论人民民主专政）从政治上讲，我们还有帝国主义站在旁边，这个敌人是很凶恶的，需要我们团结广泛的革命力量，去同它作斗争。从经济上讲，由于中国经济的落后，要使中国工业化，为过渡到社会主义准备条件，除了主要地发展人民国家的经济、半社会主义性质的合作经济外，还必须利用一切于国计民生有利而不是有害的城乡资本主义的因素。因此我们对于民族资产阶级的关系——革命朋友的关系，应是从党的政策路线出发，而不是从个人好恶的狭隘情绪出发，这样才能求得在这一问题上的自觉和主动。自觉和主动，正是阶级觉悟的标志。
    小资产阶级知识分子，有些由于革命的锻炼不足，常常对于革命存有不合实际的幻想，以为革命战争的胜利，推翻了帝国主义和国民党反动派的统治，该是一切都美满了，该是享受的时候了，并且在享受的观点上，常常夹杂着剥削阶级的腐朽观点。而不了解这“只是万里长征走完了第一步”，在今后一个历史时期内，还有艰巨的任务摆在我们面前，还须要发扬我们艰苦奋斗的作风，我们的前途是美满幸福的，正是为了这样的前途，我们还必须继续地保持艰苦奋斗的作风，事情不是一步登天的，幸福需要用我们自己用斗争和劳动来一点一滴的培植。
    至于那些蜕化、腐化堕落的思想行为，是极少数的。这种思想行为是可耻的。但是只要绝大多数的同志觉悟起来，部队的正气抬头了，批评与自我批评开展了，这种思想行为是可以得到克服的。
    综上所述，我们部队教育的当前任务，除了必须进行新民主主义的政策教育外，还一定要加强共产主义的前途教育，和国际主义的教育，使部队同志能够开扩眼界，认清前途，从狭隘、保守观念和民族主义情绪的圈子里摆脱出来，真正接受毛主席“夺取全国胜利，这只是万里长征走完了第一步”，“永远是一个战斗队”的指示。
    解决这些思想问题的主要关键，在于干部。只要干部思想搞通了，部队思想问题就基本上解决了。
    部队必须从积极方面去从事思想建设，也就是说，要加强部队干部的理论学习，只有这样才能克服经验主义，加强部队的思想领导，使干部能够从部队思想反映中找到它的本质，针对部队思想的实际，去树立它所缺乏与不足的方面，有步骤地加以引导，不断提高阶级觉悟。这是艰巨而需要极大耐心的工作。不加分析研究，被纷乱的现象所迷惑，片面地、头痛医头脚痛医脚地忙于反倾向，是不能有效地解决部队思想倾向的。树立理论与实际结合的教育作风，对于我们有极其重要的意义。
