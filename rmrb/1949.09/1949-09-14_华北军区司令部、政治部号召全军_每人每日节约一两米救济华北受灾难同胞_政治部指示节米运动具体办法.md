　　Headquarters of the North China Military Region Calls on the Entire Army
    Every Person to Save One Liang of Rice Per Day to Help Compatriots in North China Affected by Disaster
    Political Department Instructs on Specific Methods for the Rice-Saving Campaign
    [Our Newspaper’s Dispatch] The Headquarters of the North China Military Region and its Political Department issued a call to the entire army on the 12th of this month to launch a campaign to save one liang of rice per person per day in order to help compatriots in the North China region who are suffering from various disasters. The call stated:
    Comrades, all commanders and fighters of the North China People's Liberation Army, all political workers, and all logistical workers:
    This year, the North China Liberated Area has experienced drought followed by floods, and some areas are also suffering from floods and insect plagues. Although the government and the people have made great efforts to combat the disaster, the situation remains extremely serious. In Hebei Province alone, more than three million people have been affected by the disaster, and their lives are very difficult. In addition, the anti-people's war launched by the American imperialists and the Kuomintang reactionaries has long devastated and destroyed the vast rural areas. The affected people have no savings, and not only is there no hope for this year's autumn harvest, but there is also no strength for this year's autumn planting. This is an extremely serious problem.
    We are the sons and daughters of the people. The people's disasters are our own disasters, and the people's suffering is our own suffering. We have spared no effort to sacrifice our lives for the liberation of the people and to obtain a happy life. Now that the people are in trouble, we must give them enthusiastic assistance.
    The North China People's Liberation Army has a blood-and-flesh relationship with the people of North China. During the twelve years of revolutionary war, the people of North China made extremely great contributions, endured all kinds of hardships, and gave everything they had to support the revolutionary war and the People's Liberation Army. This is the basic factor for victory. The North China People's Liberation Army also has a long and glorious tradition of sharing weal and woe with the people of North China and helping the people. This is not only reflected in our heroic battles, but also in our great actions to produce and save, helping the people to overcome all enemies, disasters, waterlogging, drought, and insect plagues. We should now carry forward this good tradition, enthusiastically assist the disaster-stricken people of North China, and repay the profound friendship of the people of North China to us.
    The hundreds of thousands of troops in North China should do their best to help, and have the strength to do so. Saving one liang of rice per person per day, and persisting in it for six months, is a large number. Coupled with government relief and mutual assistance among the people, it can enable millions of disaster-stricken people to overcome the disaster and plant wheat. And this will not have a great impact on us, and is completely achievable.
    You will surely respond enthusiastically to this call. The reason we only propose saving one liang of rice is for a long-term movement, to maintain a certain amount of physical health for you to engage in training, protect national defense, and protect the interests of the people.
    All organs, schools, and companies of the North China People's Liberation Army, save all the expenses you can save, and use part of your surplus from production and savings to help the disaster-stricken people!
    [Another Dispatch] After the call to launch the one liang of rice saving campaign was issued, the Political Department of the North China Military Region issued specific methods to its subordinate units on the 13th to mobilize the troops to respond to the call.
    The instruction emphasized: This call must be grasped by the Party committee, and in-depth communication and education must be carried out in every company and food unit. Mobilize the masses to discuss, and under the principle of the masses' conscious and voluntary participation, pass a resolution responding to this call. Oppose using command methods to force the masses to implement it. When the masses have been mobilized, another deviation may occur, disregarding that this is a long-term movement (six months) and that the soldiers' food intake will increase in autumn and winter, and demanding to save more rice every day. Leaders should pay attention to grasping and preventing this tendency to maintain the soldiers' certain health and enable the movement to be sustained. It also pointed out that after carrying out savings, each company and food unit should strengthen the management of food, and should not relax the improvement of food under the pretext of saving.
    For various agencies, troops, and schools, the instruction indicated: Conduct an inspection of office miscellaneous expenses, study methods of saving, and formulate the amount of funds that can be saved and donated to the disaster-stricken people within six months as a goal to strive for within half a year, and submit them to the Logistics Department of the Military Region in two batches (the first batch at the end of November, and the second batch at the end of October next year) to be transferred to the government (the figures should be reported to the headquarters).

　　华北军区司令部、政治部号召全军
    每人每日节约一两米救济华北受灾难同胞
    政治部指示节米运动具体办法
    【本报讯】华北军区司令部、政治部于本月十二日对全军发出号召，开展每人每日节约一两米运动，以救济华北区遭受各种灾难的同胞。号召称：
    华北人民解放军全体指战员、全体政治工作人员、全体后勤工作人员同志们：
    华北解放区今年先旱后涝，若干地区还遭受着水灾和虫灾，虽然经政府和人民以大力来与灾荒搏斗，但灾情仍是异常严重的；仅仅河北一省，被灾人民就有三百多万人，他们的生活非常困难。加上美帝国主义国民党反动派所发动的反人民战争，广大的农村，长期遭受摧残和破坏，受灾的人民没有积蓄，不仅今年秋收没了希望，今年的秋种也没有力量，这是一个极其严重的问题。
    我们是人民的子弟，人民的灾难就是我们自己的灾难，人民的痛苦，就是我们自己的痛苦，我们为了人民的解放和得到幸福的生活，曾经不惜牺牲自己的生命，现在人民有了灾难，我们一定要给以热情的援助。
    华北人民解放军，同华北人民是血与肉的关系，十二年的革命战争里，华北人民尽了自己极其伟大的贡献，忍受一切艰苦困难，拿出自己的一切，来支援革命战争，支持人民解放军，这是胜利的基本因素。华北人民解放军也有着同华北人民共患难、援助人民的悠久的光辉传统，这不仅表现在我们的英勇作战上，还表现在我们生产节约帮助人民战胜一切敌灾、水旱虫灾的伟大行动上。我们现在就应当发扬这个好传统，热情地援助华北的灾难人民，报答华北人民对于我们的深厚情谊。
    华北几十万大军应当尽援助的力量，并且有这个力量，每人每天节约一两米，坚持它六个月，就是很大的数目。加上政府的救济与人民的互助，就可以使几百万灾难人民，战胜灾荒，并且可以把麦子种上。而这对我们来说，并不发生很大的影响，是完全可以做到的。
    你们一定会热烈响应这个号召的。我们所以只提出一两米的节约，是为了持久的运动，为了保持你们一定的体力健康，好从事训练，保护国防保护人民利益。
    一切华北人民解放军的机关、学校和连队，节省你们一切可以节省的开支，将你们生产节约所余的一部分，援助灾难的人民！
    【又讯】华北军区政治部在开展节约一两米运动号召发出后，十三日又指示所属各部队具体办法，以发动部队响应号召。
    指示中强调指出：这个号召，必须由党委掌握，在每一个连队及伙食单位深入进行传达教育，发动群众讨论，在群众自觉自愿的原则下，通过响应这一号召的决议。反对以命令的方式，强迫群众执行。而当群众已经发动起来，可能产生另一种偏向，不顾及这是持久的运动（六个月）和秋冬两季战士食量增加的情况，要求每天节约更多的米。这种倾向应由领导注意掌握防止，以保持战士的一定健康，并使运动能够持久。并指出：各连队及伙食单位在进行节约后，应加强伙食的管理工作，不得以节约为借口，放松对伙食的改善。
    对各机关、部队、学校，则指示：要作一次对办公杂支费开支的检查，研究节约的办法，拟定六个月内可以节约捐助受灾人民的款项数字，作为半年内努力的目标，并分两批（第一批十一月底，第二批明年十月底）交军区后勤部转政府（数字告本部）。
