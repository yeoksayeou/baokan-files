Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 3rd: According to TASS, New York, 31st: Sources in Mexico state that the American Congress in Support of Peace continues to receive letters from millions of people expressing their support for the Congress scheduled to be held on September 5th. A group consisting of approximately one thousand women from Latin America, one hundred and twenty-five women from Canada, and one hundred women from the United States jointly issued a statement calling on women from all walks of life, regardless of their political and religious beliefs, to "establish a barrier of peace to resist the instigators of war." "Workers' Voice" of Rio de Janeiro published on August 20th a statement by Prestes, General Secretary of the Brazilian Communist Party and Senator, urging all democrats and workers in Latin America to support the Congress in Mexico City. The statement said that due to the political persecution of the Dutra government, I am forced to hide, "but I continue to fight with the people against the shackles of imperialism, against the Dutra government, and to defend Brazil's peace and independence." "Workers' Voice" also stated that despite the police implementing terror in major industrial areas, many states in Brazil have held congresses in support of peace, including Rio de Janeiro, Bahia, and São Paulo. The "Mexican Youth League" issued a statement stating that Mexican youth will never participate in wars of aggression. The Mexican National Teachers' Union also announced its support for the American Congress in Support of Peace.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 3rd: Polish News Agency, Paris: The French Committee of the World Congress in Support of Peace has issued a declaration calling on the people of the country to participate in the peace vote to be held throughout France from September 3rd to October 2nd (International Peace Day). Voters will sign the ballot, which reads: I vote for peace because I do not want France to become a battlefield again; because I do not believe that peace can be maintained by threatening with atomic bombs, by preparing for war through military pacts against other countries, or by pushing the world onto the road of an arms race; because I do not want to see hundreds of billions of francs wasted on military budgets, which constantly increase the national burden; because I do not want to rebuild a militaristic West Germany inspired by the spirit of revenge and threatening France's security; because I believe the Vietnam War is shameful; because I know that the vast majority of French people long for peace, and their unity can force that small minority who want war in order to profit from it to accept peace. On this occasion of commemorating International Peace Day, I express my wishes to the government and prove to friends around the world that I stand actively united with them.

　　建立和平屏障抵制战争贩子
  　美洲和平大会即召开法国将举行和平投票
    【新华社北平三日电】据塔斯社纽约三十一日讯：墨西哥方面消息称：美洲拥护和平大会继续不断地接获千万人的来函，表示拥护定于九月五日举行的大会。由拉丁美洲妇女约一千人，加拿大妇女一百二十五人，美国妇女一百人所组成的一个团体，联合发表文告，号召各阶层妇女，不论其政治及宗教信仰，“建立和平的屏障，以抵制战争的挑拨者”。里约热内卢的“工人呼声报”于八月二十日登载巴西共产党总书记、参议员普列斯特的文告，敦促拉丁美洲的一切民主人士及工人们，拥护墨西哥城的大会。该文告中说，由于杜特拉政府的政治迫害，我被迫藏避起来，“但是我继续与人民一起进行斗争，以反对帝国主义的束缚，反对杜特拉政府，保卫巴西的和平与独立。”“工人呼声报”又称，尽管警察在主要工业区施行恐怖，巴西许多州均曾举行拥护和平大会，其中包括里约热内卢、巴伊亚、圣保罗诸州。“墨西哥青年联盟”发表声明称，墨西哥青年决不参加侵略战争。墨西哥全国教师联合会亦宣布支持美洲拥护和平大会。
    【新华社北平三日电】波兰通讯社巴黎讯：世界拥护和平大会法国委员会顷发表宣言，号召全国人民参加定于九月三日至十月二日（国际和平日）在法国各地举行的和平投票。投票人将在票上签名，上面写着：我投票拥护和平，因为我不希望法国再度成为战场；因为我不相信能以原子弹威胁，能以反对其他国家的军事公约进行战争准备，能以把世界推上军备竞赛的道路来维持和平；因为我不希望看到千百亿法郎浪费在军事预算上，而经常增加国家负担；因为我不希望重建一个为报复精神所鼓舞和威胁法国安全的军国主义的西德国家；因为我认为越南战争是可耻的；因为我知道绝大多数法国人渴望和平，而且他们的团结能够迫使那一小撮为了从战争中获利而想战争的人不得不接受和平。当此纪念国际和平日之时，我以此表示我对政府的愿望并向全世界友人证明我同他们积极团结一致。
