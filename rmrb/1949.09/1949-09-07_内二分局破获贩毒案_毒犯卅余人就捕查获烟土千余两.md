Internal Affairs Second Branch of the Public Security Bureau Cracks Drug Trafficking Case; Thirty-Plus Drug Dealers Arrested and Over One Thousand Taels of Opium Seized

[This Newspaper's Report] The Internal Affairs Second Branch of the Ping City Public Security Bureau cracked a major opium trafficking case within the jurisdiction of the Fifth District on August 27th. A total of 1,203 taels of opium were seized, and 31 drug dealers, including Li Mingyuan and Zhang Zhenwu, were arrested.

The main culprit, Li Mingyuan, had previously served as an adjutant in the Kuomintang army. After retiring, he engaged in drug trafficking, frequently traveling between Chifeng, Rehe, and Beiping to sell large quantities of opium. During the Japanese occupation, he openly colluded with the enemy to traffic drugs, had many accomplices, and was well-organized. After liberation, disregarding the laws of the People's Government, the suspect transported 2,000 taels of opium from Chifeng. After thorough investigation by the Internal Affairs Second Branch of the Public Security Bureau, officers went to Li Mingyuan's residence in Caochang Hutong, Fifth District, on the night of August 27th for a search. They arrested Li Mingyuan, Li Wangshi, and other suspects, and seized 400 taels of opium and 24 rounds of handgun ammunition from the rooftop, flower pots, and latrine cesspool of Li Mingyuan's house. Five taels of opium were seized from Li Wangshi's water tank. On the morning of the 28th, Zhang Zhenwu was arrested at No. 4, Shuita Hutong, Third District. Zhang voluntarily handed over more than 290 taels of opium. After interrogation, other drug offenders and the car transporter Li Yuchun were identified from Li's confession. Public security personnel immediately took action and arrested the suspects in the Fifth District, Third District, and Fourth District. Upon further interrogation, important drug offenders Zhou Guoyuan, Xu Changchun, Zhang Yaodong, and Zhang Dexin were identified from Li Yuchun. When the suspects were arrested, a large quantity of opium, white flour material, and acetic acid were also seized. Through separate interrogations, it was learned that Li Yuchun had two large trucks, one of which was operational. It was usually driven to Chifeng to transport opium back for sale to major drug dealers in Pingjin and even as far as the Northeast. This time, Li Yuchun transported seven packages of opium for Li Mingyuan and others, each weighing approximately 100 taels. More than nine packages (totaling 1,203 taels) have been identified. The freight cost was 100 yuan per 100 taels. The transportation method was to load opium into four tires of a ten-wheel truck, with each trip carrying approximately 2,000 taels. After Li Yuchun was arrested, the whereabouts of his truck became unknown, and the search is underway. A total of 34 people are involved in the case. Except for three people who left Ping early and have not yet been apprehended, the rest have been arrested. Eleven of them are repeat offenders and have been handed over to the court for processing. The remaining offenders will be dealt with separately by the branch bureau.

The Internal Affairs Second Branch of the Public Security Bureau's handling of this case was characterized by steady steps, swift action, thorough searches, and persuasion to encourage the suspects to confess and reveal relevant accomplices, thus cracking the entire case and seizing a large quantity of drugs.

    【本报讯】平市公安内二分局于八月二十七日在内五管界破获贩运大批烟毒案一件，共搜出烟土一千二百零三两，并逮捕毒犯李明远、张振武等三十一人。
    主犯李明远早年曾任国民党军副官，退职后即以贩毒为业，经常来往于热河赤峰与北平之间，贩卖大批烟土。日寇统治时期更公开与敌人勾结贩毒，同伙甚多，且有组织。解放后，该犯不顾人民政府法令，由赤峰运来烟土二千两。经公安内二分局多方侦查确实后，乃于八月二十七日夜前往内五草厂胡同李明远家查抄。当捕获李明远、李王氏等犯。并从李明远家屋顶、花盆内、厕所粪坑内搜出烟土四百两，手枪子弹二十四发。从李王氏水缸内搜出烟土五两。二十八日晨又在内三水獭胡同四号捕获张振武，张自动交出烟土二百九十余两，经审讯，复从李犯供词中获悉其他有关毒犯及汽车运送人李玉春。公安人员立即出动将各该犯分别由内五、内三、外四一带抓获归案。复经审讯，又从李玉春口中获悉重要毒犯周国源、徐长春、张耀东、张德馨等人情况，抓获各该犯时，同时搜出烟土、白面料子、醋酸甚夥。经分头审讯，得悉李玉春有大汽车二辆，一辆可用，平日专走赤峰，运回烟土销售给平津大毒贩，并远及东北一带。此次李玉春代李明远等人运回烟土七个，每个约百两，经查出者已达九个多（合一千二百零三两）。运费每百两大头百元。运送法是将十轮大卡，以四个轮装烟土，每次可装二千两。李玉春被捕后，其大卡车已不知去向，现正追究中。又全案共牵涉人犯三十四人，除三名早日离平尚未归案外，其余均已就逮。其中十一人系老犯，已送法院处理。其余犯人，将由分局分别处理。
    公安内二分局人员办理此案的特点是步骤稳重，行动迅速，搜查严密，并以说服方式争取犯人坦白，说出有关人犯，故能破获全案，搜出大批毒品。
