　　A Visit with Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Representative
    Worker Leader Zhang Fulin
    Chen Jun
    Zhang Fulin, the Deputy Director of the Shandong Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, is a representative from a worker background attending the People's Political Consultative Conference. When the reporter expressed his respect, he hurriedly explained:
    "My participation in the People's Political Consultative Conference is an honor for the entire working class. Our working class, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, has achieved liberation and elevated status through long-term bloody struggles. This honor is not mine alone."
    Zhang Fulin cited facts to prove this point.
    "My background is very poor!" His parents died one after another when he was a teenager. From the age of thirteen, he herded cattle for others, and at sixteen, he entered the Zaozhuang coal mine. He said of his life at that time: "It was too difficult to even mention! One day's wages were only fourteen copper coins." Later, he found work operating an electric winch. Being beaten, scolded, and unable to eat his fill or dress warmly, these painful torments tempered him into a staunch class fighter. From 1926 onwards, he began to lead miners in participating in the struggle against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. During the Great Revolution, he organized the Zaozhuang mining area trade union with nine thousand members. However, the Kuomintang's betrayal of the revolution led to the unemployment of tens of thousands of workers in the mining area, and Zhang Fulin was one of them. But he was not discouraged. For the sake of the livelihood of all unemployed workers, he actively united unemployed workers, organized the unemployed workers' union, and demanded resumption of work. The enemy began to threaten, attempting to soften and buy off the leader of the unemployed workers, allowing Zhang Fulin to immediately resume work with a wage increase to five yuan; at the same time, he was asked to abandon the leadership of the resumption of work movement. Zhang Fulin rejected this shameless request. On August 5, 1928, the capitalists colluded with the reactionary Kuomintang government and, under the pretext of negotiating with the unemployed workers' union, detained four leaders of the unemployed workers, using soft persuasion and hard threats, attempting to force them to surrender, but all failed. Finally, Zhang Fulin was sent to Jinan, sentenced to imprisonment, and spent more than six years in prison, only to be released in 1934.
    After his release, he returned to the Zaozhuang mining area. Although under the surveillance of mine police and foremen, he continued to secretly unite with his fellow workers to prepare forces. With the end of the Xi'an Incident and the continuous upsurge of the anti-Japanese movement, in 1937, the entire mine's workers elected him as their chief representative, resuming the responsibility of leading the trade union. At this time, the ruling class summoned him, pretending to offer well-intentioned advice, asking him why he had served six years in prison, saying that the protruding nail gets hammered down first, and that imprisonment was self-inflicted suffering, so why bother to be foolishly stubborn and invite hardship upon himself? They advised him not to stand out again and promised him at the time to increase his wages from nine yuan to forty-five yuan. Zhang Fulin smiled and said to the reporter: "That was just wishful thinking! Could I, Zhang Fulin, be bought off with this little money?" He ignored it and continued to carry out anti-Japanese organizational work. Later, the workers in the Zaozhuang and Jiawang mining areas became an important force in actively supporting the front lines in the early stages of the Anti-Japanese War. After the enemy occupied Xuzhou, he pulled out the workers' ranks and retreated into the mountains, establishing the Lunan Volunteer Army, which was the predecessor of the Eighth Division of the Third Field Army of the People's Liberation Army.
    Because of his long-term common struggle with the workers of Lunan and his close ties with them, after 1940, he assumed the responsibility of leading the Lunan Federation of Trade Unions. He has always stood at the forefront of the anti-Japanese struggle, going in and out of enemy-occupied areas and guerrilla areas, operating on both sides of the Jinpu Railway, and persisting in leading the workers in the Zaozhuang and Jiawang areas in carrying out the anti-Japanese struggle. In 1945, the Second Shandong Provincial Congress of Workers and Staff was held in Linyi, and he was honorably elected as the Vice Chairman of the General Federation of Trade Unions. In recent years, he has led and organized workers throughout the province to actively produce and support the People's Liberation War. He said: "This time, I am here to attend the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference on behalf of the interests and opinions of the working class. The three important resolutions of the People's Political Consultative Conference are very complete, and we workers resolutely support them and guarantee their implementation among the workers in Shandong." When he talked about the soon-to-be-established Central People's Government, he said even more happily: "It is our own government. Think about it, how many years have passed, has there ever been such a government that supports the workers and the working people? For so many years, workers have been oppressed, precisely because there was no such a people's government! Therefore, our working class should first and foremost care for its own government, cherish its own government, abide by the laws and decrees of the government, and be the pillar of our government. Only when our workers do this can the People's Government have a reliable foundation. In the past, my own understanding of this was not enough."
    Zhang Fulin finished speaking, revealing the topic he wanted to illustrate. Thousands upon thousands of working-class fighters, like Zhang Fulin, have been unyielding in the struggle against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, and together with the people of the whole country, through arduous struggle, have created a new people's world. The People's Republic of China is born! Today, the glorious soldiers of the people gather together to discuss the great plan for building a new China. From now on, the people of the whole country stand up, and this is truly the glory of the working class. The glory of the Chinese people. How earnestly we should cherish this glory! Love our own people's motherland! Our working class must assume the full responsibility for building a new people's China, closely unite the peasant class, the petty bourgeoisie, the national bourgeoisie, domestic ethnic minorities, overseas Chinese and other patriotic elements, actively participate in the work of political power construction, strive to develop production, prosper the economy, and struggle for an independent, democratic, unified and prosperous New China.

　　中国人民政协代表访问记
    工人领袖张福林
    陈浚
    山东省总工会副主任张福林，是参加人民政协中一位工人出身的代表，当记者对他表示敬意时，他忙着解释说：
    “我能参加人民政协会议，这是整个工人阶级的光荣。咱们工人阶级，在中国共产党和毛主席领导之下，经过长期流血奋斗，得到翻身，地位提高了，这个光荣，不是我个人的。”
    张福林说到这里，举出事实来证明这一点。
    “我的出身很苦啊！”十几岁的时候，父母先后死去，从十三岁起，就给人放牛，十六岁就进了枣庄煤矿。第一年打卯子工（临时小工），第二年就下了井。当时的生活，他说：“困难得就不能提啊！一天的工钱，才十四个铜子”，以后，他又找到开电绞车的工。挨打受骂，吃不饱穿不暖，这些苦痛的煎熬，把他磨炼成为一个顽强的阶级战士。从一九二六年以后，他就开始了领导矿工，参加反帝反封建反官僚资本主义的斗争。在大革命的浪潮里，他曾经组织起九千会员的枣庄矿区工会。但是，国民党的叛变革命，使矿区里闹革命的工人，成千成万的失了业，张福林也是其中的一个。但是他并不气馁，为了全体失业工人的生活，他又积极团结失业工人，组织失业工人工会，要求复工。敌人开始威胁，曾经妄想软化和收买失业工人领袖，允许张福林个人立刻复工，工钱也增加到五块钱；同时，要他放弃领导复工运动，这个无耻的要求，被张福林拒绝了。一九二八年八月五日，资方勾结了国民党反动政府，假借和失业工人工会谈判，把四个失业工人的领导者扣押起来，软收买，硬威胁，企图迫使他们投降，但是都失败了。最后张福林就被解到济南，判了徒刑，坐了六年多的牢，一九三四年才出狱。
    出狱之后，他又回到枣庄矿区，虽则在矿警工头的监视之下，他仍继续暗中团结工友，准备力量。西安事变结束，抗日运动不断高涨，一九三七年全矿工人又选他当了总代表，重新负起领导工会的责任。这时，统治阶级就把他叫去，装作好意相劝，问他为什么坐了六年牢，出头的椽子先烂，坐牢是自己受罪，何苦又要傻干，自讨吃苦呢。劝他不要再出头，并且当时答应他，把工钱由九元提高到四十五元，张福林笑着对记者说：“那才是做梦哩！我张福林就能被这几个钱所买动了？”他没理那回事，继续进行抗日的组织工作，后来，枣庄和贾汪矿区的工人，成为抗日初期积极支援前线的重要力量。在敌人占领徐州之后，他拉出了工人的队伍，退入山区，成立了鲁南义勇队，这支队伍，就是现在人民解放军第三野战军八师的前身。
    由于他长期和鲁南工人一起，共同奋斗，和鲁南工人有紧密的联系，一九四零年以后，就负起领导鲁南工会的责任。他一直站在抗日斗争的最前线，进出敌占区、游击区，活动在津浦路两侧，坚持领导枣庄贾汪一带的工人，进行抗日斗争。一九四五年在临沂举行了山东第二次职工代表大会，他光荣当选了总工会副主任。几年来，领导和组织全省工人，积极生产，支援人民解放战争。他说：“这次我是代表工人阶级的利益和意见，来参加中国人民政治协商会议。人民政协的三个重要决议，非常完备，我们工人坚决拥护；并保证在山东工人中执行。”当他谈到即将成立的中央人民政府时更高兴地说：“是咱们自己的政府了。大家想想，多少年来，那曾有过这样一个政府，是给工人和劳动人民撑腰的，多少年来，工人受压迫，就是没有这样一个人民的政府呵！所以咱们工人阶级，应当首先关心自己的政府，爱护自己的政府，遵守政府的法令，做咱们政府的台柱。只有咱们工人都这样做，人民政府才有了可靠的基础。关于这一点，过去我自己的认识是不够的。”
    张福林谈完了，谈出了他所想要说明的题目。千千万万工人阶级的战士，已经象张福林一样，在和帝国主义，封建主义，官僚资本主义的斗争中，顽强不屈，和全国人民一起，经过苦斗，打出来一个人民的新天下，中华人民共和国诞生了！今天，人民光荣的战士们，会聚到一堂，来共商建设新中国大计，从此全国的人民都站起来了，这真是工人阶级的光荣。中国人民的光荣。我们应当何等尽心的来爱护这个光荣！热爱自己人民祖国！我们工人阶级要担负起建设人民新中国的全部责任，紧紧团结农民阶级，小资产阶级，民族资产阶级，国内少数民族，海外华侨和其他爱国分子，积极参加政权建设工作，努力发展生产，繁荣经济，为独立、民主、统一和富强的新中国而奋斗。
