　　Participating in the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association
  　Over 8,000 Workers Sign Up
  　Peking University to Hold Sino-Soviet Friendship Forums by District
    [Our Newspaper] After the Preparatory Committee of the Beijing Branch of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association was established, workers in various public factories in the city of Beiping were the first to express their welcome. On the 21st of last month, after Comrade Peng Zhen gave a report on Sino-Soviet relations in Zhongshan Park, factories began propaganda and mobilization, and launched a signature campaign. Workers at the Beiping Telecommunications Bureau said, "After listening to the report, we have a clearer understanding of Sino-Soviet relations. We hope to have more reports in the future." An employee of the Engineering Corps, influenced by the Kuomintang's rumors and slanders in the past, did not understand Sino-Soviet relations. After listening to the report, his thinking changed, and he also publicized the content of the report to others, mobilizing them to sign. The Beiping Telecommunications Bureau used loudspeakers and large-character posters for publicity. When it held a general meeting on the 29th of last month, more than 800 people signed up on the spot, requesting to become members of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association. By September 3rd, more than 1,600 people had signed up at the bureau. After the trade union of the North China Electric Power Company heard the report on Sino-Soviet relations by Qian Junrui, the Secretary-General of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, at the Enterprise Department, it relayed the report to the workforce. Clothing factories, North China Electric Power Company, Tram Company, General Machinery Factory, Telecommunications Bureau, Engineering Corps, Water Company, No. 1 Electrical Repair Factory, Automobile Repair Factory, People's Printing Factory, and North China Transportation Company all used various methods such as meetings, large lectures, broadcasts, and small newspapers to carry out publicity. Workers all wanted to become members quickly and were eager to know the membership conditions, articles of association, and so on. As of the 3rd, ten units had conducted signatures, and the number of signatures had reached 8,610. In addition, some units are launching a signature craze. Some units have not yet started the signature campaign because the propaganda work has not been carried out, and the workers do not yet understand the content of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association. They should speed up the publicity to catch up with other brother factories.

    [Our City News] Workers at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant launched a signature campaign to join the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association. The plant's trade union convened an enlarged cadre meeting of group leaders from various branches yesterday (the 4th), with 105 group leaders attending. Yang Kaiwen conveyed the spirit and resolutions of the Beiping Municipal People's Representatives Conference, calling on everyone to correctly understand the Soviet Union. He said that the Soviet Union is the motherland of the workers and our mentor for revolution and construction. We must organize the Beiping Branch of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association well. Regarding the work of mobilizing workers to participate in the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, each group will begin simultaneously today (the 5th), conducting in-depth publicity on Sino-Soviet friendly relations while soliciting members.
    [Our City News] The Peking University General Branch of the Communist Party of China yesterday invited the heads of the Peking University Youth League General Branch, the Student Union, the Faculty and Staff Association, and the Workers and Police Association to hold a joint meeting at the Peking University General Branch of the Communist Party to discuss how to implement the resolutions of the People's Representatives Conference and carry out publicity and education on Sino-Soviet friendship on campus, and mobilize teachers, students, workers, and police to actively participate in the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association. The meeting decided to hold Sino-Soviet friendship forums in different districts on campus. The 14th issue of the "New Peking University" wall newspaper published a special commentary entitled "Implement the Resolutions of the People's Representatives Conference and Participate in the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association," calling for learning from the Soviet Union. It also pointed out that intellectuals should play a bridging role in learning from the Soviet Union's revolutionary and construction experience and promoting Sino-Soviet cultural exchanges, and called on all teachers, students, workers, and police to actively participate in the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association.

    【本报讯】中苏友好协会北平分会筹委会成立后，平市各公营工厂工人首先表示欢迎。上月二十一日，彭真同志在中山公园作关于中苏关系的报告后，各工厂就展开宣传酝酿，和发起签名运动。北平电信工人说：“听了报告，对中苏关系清楚了，以后希望多报告。”工程总队一个职员，因过去受国民党的造谣污蔑影响，对中苏关系弄不清，听报告回来后，他思想转变了，并且还向别人宣传报告的内容，动员别人签名。北平电信局利用广播器和大字报作了宣传，上月二十九日开全体大会时，当场就有八百多人签名，请求作中苏友好协会的会员，到九月三号，该局已经有一千六百多人签名了。华北电业公司工会在企业部听了中苏友好协会总干事钱俊瑞同志关于中苏关系的报告后，回去就作了传达。被服厂、华北电业公司、电车公司、机器总厂、电信局、工程总队、自来水公司、第一电机修配厂、汽车修配厂，人民印刷厂、华北运输公司，都用开会、上大课、广播、小报等各种方式进行宣传，工人都想很快成为会员，迫切想知道会员条件、会章等。截至三日止，已有十个单位进行了签名，签名人数已有八千六百零十人。另外有些单位正在展开签名热潮。有些单位因宣传工作未展开，工人们还不了解中苏友好协会的内容，签名运动尚未开始，应该赶快宣传，赶上其他兄弟工厂。
