Several thousand young people held a bonfire party in Victory Park on September 2nd, where they performed dances of the four nationalities: Chinese, Soviet, Mongolian, and Korean. Youth from various factories, schools, and organizations in the city have also launched various forums and lectures in recent days to strengthen internationalist education. Youth from factories, schools, organizations, and military units in Jinzhou and Qiqihar also gathered to celebrate on International Youth Day, September 4th. More than two thousand young people from China and the Soviet Union in Shenyang held dance evenings and get-togethers on August 19th and 22nd.

In addition: To commemorate International Youth Day, all the Youth League members of the Kaifeng Locomotive Depot on the Longhai Railway rushed to repair the "Kaifeng Youth" locomotive. The Youth League members of the depot united the other workers and, in just half a month, revived an old locomotive that was quite badly damaged, allowing the railway bureau to free up a large locomotive to run long distances, making a significant contribution to transportation and supporting the front lines.

  　中苏蒙鲜青年联欢庆祝国际青年节日
    【新华社北平九日电】东北的沈阳、长春、锦州、齐齐哈尔，安徽省的合肥，和江苏省的泰州、南通等城市热烈庆祝国际青年节。长春市青年的庆祝节目和庆祝该市第一次青年团代表大会的节目同时举行。几千名青年九月二日在胜利公园举行了营火大会，会上表演了中、苏、蒙古、朝鲜四个民族的舞蹈。该市各工厂、学校、机关的青年连日并纷纷展开各种座谈、讲演，以加强国际主义教育。锦州和齐齐哈尔两市各工厂、学校、机关、部队的青年，也纷纷在九月四日国际青年节当天集会庆祝。沈阳中苏青年两千多人，在八月十九、二十二两天曾举行舞蹈晚会和联欢晚会。在舞蹈晚会上，中苏青年分别表演了中苏两民族的舞蹈。二十一日沈阳市青年俱乐部举行了游泳比赛。
    又：陇平铁路开封机务段的全体青年团员，为纪念国际青年节，赶修成“开封青年号”机车。该机务段的青年团员团结了其余工人，仅用半个月的时候，就使一辆破损得相当厉害的旧机车复活，让路局能腾出一辆大型机车专跑长途，对运输和支援前线贡献很大。
