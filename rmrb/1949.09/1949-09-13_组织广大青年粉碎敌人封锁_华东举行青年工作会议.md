　　Organize Broad Youth to Smash Enemy Blockade
　  East China Holds Youth Work Conference
    [Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 9th] The East China Youth Work Conference convened by the East China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee took place from August 17th to 28th, lasting twelve days. The main agenda of the conference was to discuss how to establish the Youth League in East China in a widespread and focused manner, and to mobilize the broad masses of youth to participate in the anti-blockade struggle and production and construction work. Attendees included the main cadres of the Youth Work Committees of Shandong Province (above the District Party Committee level), Fujian Province, Subei, Sunan, Northern Anhui, Southern Anhui, Zhejiang districts (above the Prefectural Committee level), and the cities of Shanghai, Nanjing, Suzhou, Hangzhou, Jinan, Qingdao, Xuzhou, and Weifang, as well as institutions such as the military and railways, and cadres of youth work organizations such as the Shanghai Municipal Work Committee of the Youth League, totaling more than one hundred people.

    During the first two days of the conference, the heads of youth work from various regions reported on the progress of work since the publication of the CPC Central Committee's resolution on establishing the League. According to incomplete statistics from various regions, there are currently about 130,000 Youth League members in East China, mostly distributed in old liberated areas in rural areas and new urban areas. League members have played a considerable and active role in various construction tasks, but a narrow, closed-door tendency is commonly present.

    During the conference, responsible comrades from the CPC Central Youth Committee and the East China Bureau gave reports. On the 19th, Feng Wenbin, Secretary of the Central Youth Work Committee, pointed out in his report that the current task of the East China youth movement is to mobilize and organize the broad masses of youth to fight to smash the enemy blockade; and the central link is to establish and develop the organization of the Youth League. He also pointed out how to overcome and prevent the tendencies of being divorced from the masses, closed-doorism, and formalism in the work of establishing the League. On the same day, Liu Xiao made a clear explanation of the youth work in implementing the six major tasks currently stipulated by the East China Bureau. On the 21st, Chen Yi, Second Secretary of the East China Bureau, reported on patriotism and internationalism. He analyzed the consistency of true patriotism and internationalism and talked about the friendly relations between China and the Soviet Union. He pointed out that only the socialist country—the Soviet Union—truly sympathizes with and helps China. Without the help of the Soviet Union, the victory of the revolution would have been impossible, and the success of the construction of the new China would also be impossible. On the 22nd, Liu Changsheng, Director of the Preparatory Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, reported on "The Tasks of the Workers' Movement." He explained the correct relationship between the trade union and the Youth League, and pointed out the necessity of developing League members among young workers.

    The attending representatives held group discussions on the two reports by Feng and Liu, and reviewed them in connection with their own work. On the 21st, the heads of the Youth Work Committees of Jiaodong, Jinan, Bengbu, Shanghai and other places made typical reports at the meeting. They made profound reviews of the closed-door tendencies existing in their work and introduced relatively successful experiences in the work of young workers and students. During the three days from the 23rd to the 26th, the conference also held separate symposiums on the work of young workers and students, summarized work experience, and discussed the relationship between the Youth League and the trade union and the student union, as well as the tasks, work, and organizational structure of the Student Federation. In addition, the conference also held separate symposiums on issues such as the establishment of Youth League committees at all levels, the communication and distribution of League newspapers, and work plans for various regions.

    On the 26th, Rao Shushi, First Secretary of the East China Bureau, gave profound answers to several important principled issues raised and discussed at the conference. Finally, Li Chang gave a summary.

　　组织广大青年粉碎敌人封锁
　  华东举行青年工作会议
    【新华社上海九日电】中共中央华东局召开的华东青年工作会议，从八月十七日到二十八日，共进行了十二天。会议主要议程是讨论如何在华东普遍而有重点地建立青年团，并发动广大青年参加反封锁斗争和生产建设工作。到会者计有山东省（区党委以上）、福建省，苏北、苏南、皖北、皖南、浙江各区（地委以上），上海、南京、苏州、杭州、济南、青岛、徐州、潍坊各市，部队、铁路等机构的青年工作委员会的主要干部，以及青年团上海市工作委员会等青年工作机构的干部，共一百多人。
    会议头两天由各地青年工作负责人汇报自中共中央建团决议公布以来的工作情况。根据各地不完全统计，目前华东青年团员共有十三万人左右，大部分布在老区农村和新区城市。团员在各项建设工作中起了相当的积极推动作用，但却较普遍地存在着狭隘的关门主义偏向。
    会议中，曾由中共中央青委和华东局负责同志作报告。十九日中央青年工作委员会书记冯文彬在报告中指出，华东青年运动的当前任务是动员和组织广大青年为粉碎敌人封锁而斗争；而中心环节是建立和发展青年团的组织。他并指出如何在建团工作中克服和防止脱离群众的关门主义与形式主义的偏向。同一天，刘晓对执行华东局所规定当前六大任务中的青年工作，作了明确的说明。二十一日，华东局第二书记陈毅报告关于爱国主义和国际主义问题。他分析了真正的爱国主义和国际主义的一致性，并谈到中苏两国的友谊关系。他指出只有社会主义的国家—苏联是真正同情和帮助中国的，没有苏联的帮助，革命胜利是不可能的，新中国建设的成功也是不可能的。二十二日由上海市总工会筹委会主任刘长胜报告“职工运动的任务”。他说明了职工会与青年团的正确关系，并指出在青年工人中发展团员的必要性。
    到会代表们曾对冯、刘的两个报告分组展开讨论，并联系本身工作加以检讨。二十一日，胶东、济南、蚌埠、上海等地青年工作委员会负责人在会上作典型报告。他们对工作中存在的关门主义偏向进行了深刻的检讨，并介绍了在青年工人工作和学生工作中较成功的经验。在二十三日至二十六日三天中，会议又分别举行了青年工人工作、学生工作的座谈会，总结了工作经验，并讨论了青年团和职工会、学生会的关系，以及学联的任务、工作和组织机构等问题。此外，对各级团委的编制问题、团报的通讯发行问题、各地区工作计划等，会议也分别举行座谈。
    廿六日，叶东局第一书记饶漱石对大会中所提出和讨论中的几个重要原则问题作了深刻解答。最后由李昌作总结。
