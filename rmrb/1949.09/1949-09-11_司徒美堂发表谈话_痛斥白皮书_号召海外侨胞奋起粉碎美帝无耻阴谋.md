Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 10th: American overseas Chinese leader Situ Meitang issued a statement yesterday denouncing the U.S. State Department's White Paper. The statement said:

"I have lived in the United States for sixty-nine years and have seen clearly the ugly state of American imperialism's consistent aggression against China for decades, while trying to cover it up with sweet talk. This White Paper can be described as the complete confession of American imperialism's attempt to destroy China. Since Japan's surrender, Truman and Marshall's massive 'aid' to the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, inciting civil war in China and slaughtering the Chinese people, is a profound crime. Chinese sons and grandsons will never forget this blood debt. However, no matter how ferocious American imperialism is, the Chinese people, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, are advancing bravely and have shattered their conspiracy. The long-suffering Chinese people have completed the great historical transformation."

"Looking at the content of the White Paper, American imperialism's ambition to enslave China is truly不死. First, they want to organize 'democratic individualism' to continue opposing communism, such as Hu Shi and Lai Lian, who are currently in the United States promoting 'Free China,' attempting to deceive overseas Chinese and the Chinese people. Second, they are trying to sow discord between China and the Soviet Union, saying that 'the CCP is serving the Soviet Union,' to slander the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. The people of the whole country and overseas Chinese have discerning eyes and will definitely continue to struggle under the leadership of Chairman Mao to crush these shameless conspiracies once again. A more miserable failure awaits American imperialism and its lackeys."

　　司徒美堂发表谈话
    痛斥白皮书
    号召海外侨胞奋起粉碎美帝无耻阴谋
    新华社北平十日电美洲华侨领袖司徒美堂昨天发表谈话，痛斥美国国务院的白皮书。谈话说：
    “我住在美国六十九年，对于美帝国主义几十年以来一贯侵略中国而又想用花言巧语去掩饰的丑态，看得清清楚楚。目前这本白皮书，可说是美帝国主义想灭亡中国的总共状。日本投降以来，杜鲁门、马歇尔对蒋介石匪帮的大批‘援助’，挑动中国内战，屠杀中国人民，这罪恶是深重的，中国人子子孙孙，难忘这笔血债。但是，不论美帝国主义多么凶狠，中国人民在毛主席领导下奋勇前进，还是把他的阴谋击破了，多苦多难的中国完成历史大翻身的伟业。”
    “从白皮书内容看：美帝国主义对于奴役中国，真是野心不死。第一、他要组织‘民主个人主义’继续反共，如胡适、赖琏之流，目前正在美国搞‘自由中国’，企图欺骗华侨与中国人民。第二、他挑拨中苏两国友谊，说‘中共是为苏联服务的’，来毁谤中国共产党的正确领导。全国人民及海外华侨，眼睛雪亮，一定在毛主席领导下继续奋斗，把这些无耻阴谋再度粉碎。更悲惨的失败等待着美帝国主义及其奴才们。”
