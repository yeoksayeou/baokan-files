Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 6th: Shanghai's largest industry, the cotton textile industry, is currently engaged in an arduous struggle against the blockade by imperialism and the Kuomintang bandit gangs. The aim of this struggle is to enable Shanghai's cotton textile industry production, which has always been mainly dependent on foreign raw materials and, to some extent, on foreign markets, to achieve complete independence and self-reliance. Shanghai's public and private cotton textile factories have a total of more than 2.4 million spindles. In the past, the cotton required was mostly dependent on imports of American and Indian cotton; a considerable portion of the yarn and cloth produced was also dependent on foreign markets such as Southeast Asia. Due to the blockade imposed by imperialism and the Kuomintang bandit gangs, the cotton textile industry is suffering temporary and serious difficulties such as a shortage of raw cotton, sluggish sales of products, and high costs. These difficulties are ultimately and centrally manifested in the decline in production of Shanghai's cotton textile industry after liberation. However, this difficulty is an unavoidable difficulty in the transition from a semi-colonial economy to an independent and self-reliant economy. The blockade by imperialism and the Kuomintang cannot stifle the survival and development of Shanghai's cotton textile industry for long. On the contrary, it will promote the independent and self-reliant development of Shanghai's cotton textile industry under the leadership of the People's Government.

　　The state-owned China Textile Construction Company, with 900,000 spindles and 18,000 looms, and its affiliated factories, resumed work as early as June 1st. Over the past three months, the China Textile Company has made every effort to maintain necessary production under difficult conditions such as raw material sales, and the machines have not stopped running, and workers have avoided unemployment. In June, the cotton mills of the China Textile Company operated five days and five nights a week, with an average of more than 517,000 spindles in operation per shift throughout the month, accounting for more than 56% of the total number of spindles that could be operated; and more than 21,900 pieces of yarn were produced. Compared with more than 490,000 spindles in operation and more than 15,400 pieces of yarn produced in May, both have exceeded. Starting in mid-July, in order to take care of the raw cotton supply situation and prevent production from being interrupted, the factories changed to working four days and four nights a week, with an average of more than 420,000 spindles in operation per shift throughout the month, accounting for more than 46% of the total number of spindles that could be operated, and more than 18,800 pieces of yarn were produced. In August, the factories continued to work four days and four nights a week before the 22nd. From the 22nd, due to electricity supply issues, they changed to working three days and five nights a week, and the number of spindles in operation has increased to more than 590,000, and the production situation has gradually improved. In the Kuomintang rule era, the China Textile Company was a well-known bureaucratic institution, with a huge organization, filled with redundant personnel, and very serious waste and unreasonable phenomena in the middle of normal production. The Shanghai Military Control Commission's Light Industry Department is currently working on reorganizing personnel and changing production policies in a planned and step-by-step manner to transform this bureaucratic capital enterprise into a people's enterprise, and to cooperate with the serious struggle of the 6 million people of Shanghai to smash the enemy's blockade.

　　上海公私营棉纺织业
  　全力展开反封锁斗争
    克服一时困难达到独立自主
    克服原料困难
  　公私各厂组联合购棉处
    【新华社上海六日电】上海最大的工业棉纺织业目前正与帝国主义和国民党匪帮的封锁进行着艰巨的斗争。这一斗争的目的，是使一向主要是依赖外国原料和在某种程度上也依赖外国市场的上海棉纺织业生产，完全达到独立自主。上海公私营棉纺织厂共有纱锭二百四十余万枚，过去所需棉花大部依赖美棉和印棉的输入；所生产出来的纱布亦有相当部分依赖南洋等地的国外市场。由于帝国主义和国民党匪帮实行封锁，棉纺织业正遭受着原棉缺乏、产品滞销、成本高昂等项暂时的严重的困难，这些困难，最后集中地表现为上海棉纺织业在解放后的减产。但这种困难是在由半殖民地经济过渡到独立自主经济的前进中所不可避免的困难。帝国主义和国民党的封锁并不能长久地窒息上海棉纺织业的生存和发展，相反地，将促使上海棉纺织业在人民政府领导下，得到独立自主的发展。
    拥有纱锭九十万枚、织机一万八千台的国营中国纺织建设公司及其所属各厂，早在六月一日即已复工。三个月来中纺公司在原料销路等困难条件下尽力维持了必要的生产，机器没有停止转动，工人避免了失业。中纺各棉纺厂六月份每周开工五日五夜，全月每班平均运转纱锭五十一万七千余枚，占可能运转纱锭总数的百分之五十六以上；产纱二万一千九百余件。与五月份运转纱锭四十九万余枚，产纱一万五千四百余件比较，都有超过。七月中旬起，为了照顾原棉供应情况不使生产中断，各厂改为每周开工四日四夜，全月每班平均运转纱锭四十二万余枚，占可能运转纱锭总数的百分之四十六以上，产纱一万八千八百余件。八月份在二十二日以前每周仍旧开工四日四夜，二十二日起由于电力供应关系，改为每周开工三日五夜，运转纱锭已增至五十九万余枚，生产情况亦随着逐步好转。国民党统治时代的中纺公司是一个有名的官僚机构，组织庞大，冗员充塞，平时生产中间浪费和不合理的现象十分严重。上海军管会轻工业处为有计划、有步骤地改造这个官僚资本的企业，使其成为人民的企业，并配合上海六百万人民粉碎敌人封锁的严重斗争，最近正在着手进行整编人员和改变生产方针。
