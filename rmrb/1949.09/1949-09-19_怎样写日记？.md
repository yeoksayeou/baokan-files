　　How to Write a Diary?
　　Lu Xuanqin
　　The content of a diary is truly infinitely broad. A person encounters many problems in a day, and as long as you pay a little attention, there are many issues worth writing about. Trivial matters in life are often mistaken as the entirety or the main content of a diary. I think it is more important to include reviews and insights on work and study. In this way, conducting irregular but frequent inspections in the diary is very beneficial for research work; at the same time, recording problems discovered during learning is no worse than specialized study notes for people with weak study habits. Furthermore, daily encounters or discoveries can be recorded, such as news from newspapers, or expressing opinions on the film itself and the story's content after watching a movie. Also, I once designed a musical instrument and often wrote about the construction process in my diary, and also practiced composing music. In short, the content of the diary should be written in a light and lively manner, rich and abundant, making it diverse and interesting, rather than turning it into a dull and tedious account, wasting time in vain.
　　Regarding how to write it: I have used two forms. One is to record everything in one notebook, separating each section with symbols, adding subheadings when discussing a specific issue. If there is time at the end of the month, compiling a table of contents makes it resemble a monthly magazine. This method is more convenient and suitable for people who write separate work logs and study notes, but it is relatively difficult to browse or organize. Another form is to use a loose-leaf notebook to record by category, sorting and binding regularly or irregularly. I have categorized them as follows: such as life reflections, thematic discussions, work research, small knowledge notes, idiom word identification, reading notes, report records, etc. Here, life reflections are the main focus, as this category includes the formulation of work, study, and life plans, as well as reflection and inspection on them. This form is easy to consult, it just feels troublesome when you are not used to it at the beginning, but once you get used to it, you will understand its benefits.
　　Once you are relatively skilled at writing a diary, you should try to make the diary entries as concise as possible, think more before writing, raise the issues, consider them more systematically, and then write.
　　You should regularly browse old diaries, write a summary every half month or a month, conduct a comprehensive check on yourself, see how much of your original plan has been achieved, identify achievements and shortcomings, and study and formulate the plan for the next month.

### 怎样写日记？

　　怎样写日记？
    陆旋勤
    日记的内容真是无限广泛，一个人在一天中会遇到许许多多的问题，只要稍加留意，便有好多问题值得一写。生活上的琐事，往往被误认为这就是日记的全部或主要的内容。我以为更重要的应是工作和学习上的检讨和心得。这样，在日记上作不定期的但又是经常的检查工作，对研究业务是很有益处的；同时，记些在学习中发现的问题，对于学习习惯不强的人也并不见得比专门的学习笔记要差。其他，日常遇到或发现的一些问题都可以记下来，比如报纸上的消息、看完电影对影片本身和故事的内容都可以在日记上“发表意见”；又，我曾设计过一具琴，并在制作中常常把制作的情况写到日记上，也练习过作曲。总之，要把日记的内容写得轻松活泼，充实丰裕，使它多样化、趣味化，而不该是搞成一本枯燥生涩的流水帐，白白浪费时间。
    再说怎样记的问题：我用过两种形式，一种是一个本子什么都记，每段用符号隔开，专讲一个问题时加上小标题，到月底如果有时间，编出目录就很象一本月刊。这方法较方便，适合另写工作日志和学习笔记的人，但是翻阅或整理时比较难。另一形式就是用活页本分类记，定期或不定期分订整理。我分过这些类：如生活杂感、专题讨论、工作研究、小知识杂记、成语字辨、读书笔记、报告记录等等。这里更以生活杂感一项为主，因这一项包括工作、学习、生活计划的制订，以及对它的反省检查。这形式便于查阅，就是开头不惯时觉得麻烦，惯了你就会晓得它的好处了。
    当你的日记写得比较熟练以后，应该尽量把日记写得简短，写前多想想，把问题提出来，较有系统地考虑一下再写。
    应该经常翻阅旧日记，半个月或一个月写一篇总结，对自己作一次全面的检查，看看自己原来的计划实现了多少，找出成绩和缺点，研究制定下个月的计划。
