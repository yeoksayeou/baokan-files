To the Editor:

The two archways on the west side of the Front Gate in our city leak incessantly whenever there is heavy rain, and even continue to leak for two or three days after the rain stops. The reason is that the damaged part of the city wall is soaked with water, and the area is getting larger and larger. Many of the bricks above have sunk, forming cracks, and the traces are already clearly visible.

In the past, during the reactionary rule, they used mud to cover it up, but it was not thorough. Coupled with the continuous rain this summer, the degree of damage has accelerated. The passing trams and heavy vehicles vibrate every day, which looks quite dangerous.

I hope the Construction Bureau will quickly send someone to investigate. Even if it is not possible to start a thorough overhaul immediately, a temporary solution should be found. Preventing problems before they occur is always better than locking the stable door after the horse is stolen.

### 前门旁门洞坏裂建设局请速查修

　　前门旁门洞坏裂建设局请速查修编辑：
    本市前门靠西边的两个门洞每遇大雨便淋漓不止的漏水，甚至雨后两三天仍是漏个不止。其原因是城墙损坏部分被水浸透，面积愈套愈大，上面的砖多已下沉，凹成裂缝，痕迹已显然可见。
    过去反动派统治时期曾经用泥涂掩饰抹过，但是不彻底，加以今夏雨水连绵，更加速了损坏的程度。每天电车同载重车辆往来震动，看着相当危险。
    希望建设局急速派人查勘，就是一时不能彻底动工大修，也要想个临时治标办法。因为防患于未然，总胜似亡羊补牢。
