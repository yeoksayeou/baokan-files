Subsequently, everyone engaged in a lively discussion on the principles and practical work of Chinese writing reform, unanimously agreeing that the evolution of Chinese writing would inevitably lead to phonetic writing, and that Roman Latin letters should be adopted for phonetic writing, supplemented by the International Phonetic Alphabet. Regarding the task of organizing simplified Chinese characters, everyone believed that extensive and in-depth research should be conducted to simplify commonly used characters with many strokes, in order to facilitate popular education and improve mass culture. In addition, a detailed discussion was held on general issues related to the promotion of Latinization.

　　讨论文字改革原则
  　文字改革协会发起人会
  　召开第四次会议
    【平市讯】中国文字改革协会发起人会，五日下午在华北大学举行第四次会议。出席人有：郭沫若、马叙伦、茅盾、范文澜、成仿吾、吴玉章、黎锦熙、罗常培、陆志韦、叶圣陶、萧三、林汉达、叶丁易、聂真等。会议开始，吴玉章对郭沫若、马叙伦、茅盾、范文澜、成仿吾等人热心参加为该会的发起人，表示热烈欢迎。接着，大家就中国文字改革的原则及实际工作问题等展开热烈讨论，一致认为中国文字的演进，必然走拼音文字的道路，而拼文字要采取罗马拉丁字母，并辅之以国际音标。对于简体汉字的整理问题，大家认为应作广泛而深入的研究，将日常用字笔划繁多的加以简化，以供普及教育和提高大众文化之用。另外，对拉丁化推行的一般问题，亦作了详尽的讨论。
