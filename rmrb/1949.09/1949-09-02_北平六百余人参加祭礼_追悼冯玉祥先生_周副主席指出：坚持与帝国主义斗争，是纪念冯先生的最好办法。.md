　　Beiping Six Hundred People Attend Memorial Service
  　Commemorating Mr. Feng Yuxiang
  　Vice Chairman Zhou Points Out: Persisting in the Struggle Against Imperialism is the Best Way to Commemorate Mr. Feng.
    [This newspaper reported] The memorial service for the first anniversary of Mr. Feng Yuxiang's death was held at 2:00 PM on September 1st in the auditorium of the Beiping Art College. Attendees included Li Jishen, Soong Ching Ling, Zhou Enlai, Shen Junru, Zhang Lan, He Xiangning, Guo Moruo, Lin Boqu, Wu Yuzhang, Dong Biwu, Huang Yanpei, Zhang Bojun, Tan Pingshan, Cai Tingkai, Luo Longji, Peng Zemin, Chen Qiyou, Deng Yingchao, Li Lisan, Cai Chang, Zhu Xuefan, Zhang Xiruo, Mao Dun, Cao Jinghua, and Feng's widow, Li Dequan, totaling over six hundred people. Wreaths and elegiac couplets sent by Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, various democratic parties, and people's organizations filled the surroundings of the venue. In the mournful music, a simple memorial ceremony was held, presided over by Mr. Li Jishen. Mr. Li Jishen said in his speech: It has been a year since Mr. Feng passed away. In the past, in Hong Kong and Shanghai, we could not properly hold a memorial service. Our wish has only been realized today in the people's capital. The goals Mr. Feng strived for during his lifetime will soon be fully realized. Therefore, holding such a memorial service today, apart from deeply mourning Mr. Feng, our feelings are very different from a year ago. Vice Chairman Zhou said: Mr. Feng Yuxiang transformed from a typical old-style military man into a democratic military man. He went through a tortuous path and finally moved towards a new democratic China. Mr. Feng engaged in anti-Chiang activities during his lifetime, and especially in the United States, he engaged in a head-on struggle with American imperialism in his final act. Today, the struggle against Chiang is about to be won, but the struggle against imperialism, especially against American imperialism, will be a matter for a considerable period to come. Mr. Feng resolutely rejected the enticements of American imperialism and resolutely left the United States to return to the Chinese liberated areas, accepting the call to participate in the New Political Consultative Conference. Unfortunately, he died on the way, which is worth commemorating by everyone. Today, the best way to commemorate Mr. Feng is to persist in the struggle against imperialism, especially against American imperialism. Mr. Shen Junru said: We must learn from Mr. Feng's hardworking style and upward learning spirit, which will be very helpful for the future construction of the new China. Mr. Guo Moruo said: We must learn from his spirit of being close to the people and serving the people, and learn from his excellent style of courageously correcting his mistakes. The memorial service concluded after a thank-you speech by Ms. Li Dequan.

　　北平六百余人参加祭礼
  　追悼冯玉祥先生
  　周副主席指出：坚持与帝国主义斗争，是纪念冯先生的最好办法。
    【本报讯】冯玉祥先生逝世一周年追悼大会，于九月一日午后二时假北平市艺术专科学校大礼堂举行。出席者有李济深、宋庆龄、周恩来、沈钧儒、张澜、何香凝、郭沫若、林伯渠、吴玉章、董必武、黄炎培、章伯钧、谭平山、蔡廷锴、罗隆基、彭泽民、陈其尤、邓颖超、李立三、蔡畅、朱学范、张奚若、茅盾、曹靖华及冯夫人李德全等共六百余人。毛主席、朱总司令及各民主党派、各人民团体所送的挽联花圈布满了会场的四周。在哀乐声中，由李济深先生主持举行了简单的祭礼。李济深先生致词说：冯先生逝世一周年了。过去在香港上海等地，我们都不可能好好开一个追悼会，我们的这一志愿今天在人民的首都才得以实现。冯先生生前奋斗的目标也很快就要完全实现了。因此，我们今天开这样一个追悼会，除了深切地悼念先生，我们的心情和一年以前是有很大不同的。周副主席说：冯玉祥先生从一个典型的旧军人转变成一个民主的军人，他经过曲折的道路，最后走向了新民主主义的中国。冯先生生前曾进行反蒋，尤其在美国最后一幕与美帝国主义曾进行了正面的斗争。今天反蒋的斗争快要胜利了，但是反帝国主义尤其是反美帝国主义的斗争，则是今后相当长期内的事情。冯先生坚决地拒绝了美帝国主义对他的引诱，毅然离美准备回到中国解放区，接受参加新政治协商会议的号召，不幸中途遇难，实值得大家纪念。今天我们纪念冯先生的最好办法，就是坚持对帝国主义的斗争，尤其是对美帝国主义的斗争。沈钧儒先生说：我们要学习冯先生艰苦的作风和向上的学习精神，这对于今后新中国的建设是很有帮助的。郭沫若先生说：我们要学习他接近人民、为人民服务的精神，学习他勇于改正自己错误的优良作风。追悼会于李德全先生致谢词后闭幕。
