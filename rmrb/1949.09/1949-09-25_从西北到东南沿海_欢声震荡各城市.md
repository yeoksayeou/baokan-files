Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 24th: Cities across the country are seething with enthusiastic celebrations for the opening of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC).

　　In Shanghai, jubilation swept through every factory. After seeing the newspaper, the workers of Printing and Dyeing Factory No. 1 immediately posted "Special Editions" everywhere. "Fan Xiaofeng and Tang Guifen have become representatives of the People's Political Consultative Conference!" Fan Xiaofeng had worked in the factory for five or six years and led workers in revolutionary struggles during the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, even being imprisoned. The workers of the French-owned Electricity Company shouted everywhere, "Our Zhu Junxin has become a member of the Presidium of the People's Political Consultative Conference!" A worker from the Transportation Company who was participating in the cultural troupe had been sick for three days, but when he saw the newspaper, he immediately got out of bed and told the troupe leader, "I want to go to the Youth Center this afternoon to learn the waist drum so I can participate in the celebrations!" Ye Changxiang, a worker at the China Textile Factory, said with a smile, "Opening the newspaper, I saw several large red characters and thought someone was celebrating a happy event! Looking closely, I realized that it was our Chinese people who were celebrating a happy event." Laughter and singing filled every factory, and almost all of them produced celebration wall newspapers and held symposiums and celebrations.

　　In Nanjing, parties, organizations, factories, schools, and people from all walks of life busily held symposiums, celebrations, wrote congratulatory messages, published quick reports, and composed new songs. From morning to night, the streets and alleys of the city were filled with joyful songs. Workers in factories and women representatives from all walks of life held symposiums. Workers at the Electric Lighting Factory decided to work two hours overtime to express their congratulations. When the news reached the suburbs, farmers gathered to discuss it. Farmer Wang Changbao said, "In the past, Chiang Kai-shek established a 'central government' in Nanjing, which was full of corrupt officials who oppressed the people. When I went to the city to sell vegetables, he only gave me three hundred yuan for a six hundred yuan investment. If I didn't sell, I would be beaten. Now that we have established our own government, the people can live and work in peace."

　　When the news of the opening of the CPPCC reached Xi'an, the workers of the Dahua Textile Factory, who were gathering in a meeting, immediately burst into shouts of "Long live the People's Political Consultative Conference!" and "Long live Chairman Mao!" The cheers and applause lasted for a long time. The workers stated that they would support the convening of the CPPCC with practical actions, such as working hard to increase production and implementing the policy of mutual benefit for labor and capital. Thousands of faculty and students of the Northwest People's Revolutionary University unanimously passed a congratulatory telegram when they heard the news at the opening ceremony.

　　Three hundred thousand citizens of Nanchang were excited by the news of the CPPCC's opening. Government agencies, organizations, factories, schools, and people from all walks of life held symposiums. Workers at the Nanchang Main Station of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway proposed: To celebrate the birth of the People's Republic of China, we must build the people's railways well. The Nanchang Youth Work Committee decided to hold a city-wide celebration meeting today.

　　The people of newly liberated Fuzhou scrambled to buy the Fujian Daily, which published the news of the CPPCC's opening and Chairman Mao's speech. The newspaper increased the number of copies issued that day, but it was still not enough to meet the demand. After seeing the newspaper, the employees of the Telecommunications Bureau immediately lined up and started dancing the Yangko. The employees of the Minjiang, Pingshui, and Downstream Shipping Companies gathered on the lawn of the Minjiang Company to cheer and sing. The opening of the CPPCC became the focus of conversation for the entire city. Lin Xiude, Director of the Preparatory Office of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, said, "Our city's workers must restore production with a hundredfold effort and overcome the difficulties caused by the enemy's blockade of the port of Fuzhou." Zheng Huang, an overseas Chinese who had just returned from Yangon, excitedly stated, "The Central People's Government is about to be established, and China's status has been elevated. We can stand up and speak boldly, no longer subject to the insults of imperialism."

　　从西北到东南沿海
  　欢声震荡各城市
    【新华社北平二十四日电】全国各城市沸腾着欢庆人民政协开幕的热潮。
    在上海，欢狂席卷各个工厂。印染一厂的工人们看到报纸后，立即在各处张贴“号外”；“范小凤、汤桂芬当了人民政协代表！”范小凤在一厂做工五、六年，在国民党反动统治时，曾领导工人进行过革命斗争，坐过监牢。法商电力公司的工人们则到处呼喊着：“我们的朱俊欣当了人民政协的主席团了！”交通公司参加文工队的一位工人，已经病了三天，当他看到报纸后，立刻从床上爬起来找文工队长说：“今天下午我也要到青年馆学习腰鼓，学好了好参加庆祝！”中国纺织工厂的工人叶长相笑着说：“翻开报，几个红色大字，我以为谁在做喜事呢！仔细一看，原来是我们中国人民做喜事。”各工厂到处是一片欢笑歌唱，几乎都出了庆祝墙报，开了座谈会、庆祝会。
    南京市各党派、各团体、各工厂、各学校以及各阶层人民纷纷忙着开座谈会，庆祝会，写贺电，出快报，编唱新歌。从上午到深夜，全市街头巷尾都洋溢着愉快的歌声。各工厂的工人们和各界妇女代表，都举行了座谈会。电照厂的工人们决定加工两小时，以表庆贺。消息传到近郊，农民们纷纷聚谈。农民王长宝说：“过去蒋介石在南京搞了个‘中央政府’，尽是贪官污吏、压迫老百姓。进城卖担菜，六百块钱本钱他只给三百，不卖就得挨打。这回成立了咱们自己的政府，老百姓可以安居乐业了。”
    人民政协开幕的消息传到西安，正在集会的大华纺织厂工人们顿时响起了“人民政协会议万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”欢呼声和掌声，经久不息。工人们纷纷表示，将以努力生产，贯彻劳资两利政策的实际行动来拥护中国人民政协的召开。西北人民革命大学数千教职学员，在开学典礼中闻讯，一致通过了贺电。
    南昌三十万市民为政协开幕消息所兴奋。机关、团体、工厂、学校和各界人民，纷纷举行座谈。浙赣铁路南昌总站的工人提出：庆祝中华人民共和国的诞生，要把人民铁路建设好。南昌市青年工作委员会决定于今日举行的全市庆祝大会。
    新庆解放的福州人民争购刊出政协开幕新闻和毛主席演词的福建日报，该报当日增发了许多份，仍不够销售。电讯局职工看到报纸后，立即排队扭起秧歌来。闽江、平水、下游三轮船公司的职工则聚集在闽江公司的草坪上欢呼唱歌。人民政协开幕成了全市人民谈话的中心。市总工会筹备处主任林修德说：“我们全市工人一定要以百倍努力恢复生产，克服敌人对福州港口封锁所造成的困难。”新自仰光归国的华侨郑煌兴奋地表示：“中央人民政府即将成立，中国的地位提高了。我们可以站起来大胆地讲话，不再受帝国主义的侮辱了。”
