　　A History of American Aggression Against China
    Three. Contending for Hegemony in China (Continued from XXIV)
    Liu Danian
    This was the American aggressor's attempt to obtain China, excluding "Manchukuo," from the hands of Japan at the cost of sacrificing China's national revolutionary war. Since it would involve no sacrifice for the United States, and would allow the US-Japan-Wang-Chiang collaboration to suppress the Chinese people, this was the most ideal plan for the United States. Throughout the summer of 1941, the United States "exerted all its efforts to establish this foundation" (Note: U.S. White Paper). Roosevelt even "hoped to have a three-day meeting with Duke Konoe" (Note: Konoe's book, p. 60). Ambassador Grew in Japan also cabled the United States what he considered "the most important telegram since the beginning of his diplomatic life" (Note: Ibid., p. 71). Under these circumstances, Chiang Kai-shek, the American running dog, through his ambassador to the United States, Hu Shih, gave Roosevelt a letter saying that if there was no other way, "then China would not be able to sustain itself" (Note: Liang Mingzhi, trans., The Errors of American Policy Toward China in the Last Ten Years, published in Oriental Magazine, Vol. 44, No. 6), implicitly expressing his agreement to the American plan. At the same time, he launched an anti-communist high tide to make practical preparations for surrendering to Japan. However, the Chinese Communist Party, leading the people, resolutely opposed this, and the Japanese side also believed that stationing troops in China was a matter of life for the Japanese army and absolutely could not be conceded. As a result, the US-Japan negotiations broke down. Since 1917, the struggle between the United States, Japan, and Britain for hegemony in China in various forms developed into the Pacific War, which began in December 1941.
    After the outbreak of the Pacific War, the United States, on the one hand, used public opinion in China to openly criticize the Chiang government and paid lip service to praising certain political measures of the Communist Party, so that the Chinese People's Army would resist Japan alone! On the other hand, it continued to provide Chiang Kai-shek with more material assistance. A "financial loan" on February 7, 1942, amounted to 500 million US dollars. In June of the same year, the Sino-US Mutual Aid Agreement was established, and a total of 870 million US dollars of Lend-Lease materials were successively agreed to be given to Chiang. Chiang Kai-shek used this to encircle and blockade "democratic China," while the United States itself sat on Mount Emei with Chiang Kai-shek to watch the battle. In early 1943, Japan was playing a ridiculous trick, wanting to sign the so-called Sino-Japanese New Treaty with Wang Jingwei. Under the conditions of Japanese military occupation of China, Japan "abolished" the unequal treaties it enjoyed. The United States competed with Japan again, and quickly concluded the Sino-US New Treaty with Chiang Kai-shek on January 11, which it originally wanted to discuss "after the restoration of peace" (Note: Chiang Kai-shek: China's Destiny, Chung Cheng Bookstore edition, p. 117), implementing the same method as Japan to deceive the Chinese people.
    The war continued into 1944. On the world battlefield, due to the Soviet Union's full-scale counter-offensive against Germany, Hitler's collapse was imminent, which also made Japan's defeat in the East a foregone conclusion. The American aggression policy began to undergo important changes, preparing to adopt "appeasement" to preserve Japan's aggressive forces, and thoroughly supporting Chiang Kai-shek in China to eliminate the Chinese people's revolutionary forces—first of all, to eliminate the people's army led by the Communist Party. The arrival in China in November of that year of Hurley and Wedemeyer, the famous representatives of the American aggressors, and their replacement of Gauss and Stilwell as ambassadors to Chongqing and US military commander in China and Chiang Kai-shek's chief of staff, was a manifestation of this policy already being determined. However, in terms of implementation methods, the United States abandoned the old ways and introduced many new tricks. The first step it took was to use exchange conditions to ask the CCP to hand over its arms. Initially, Hurley came to China in the name of President Roosevelt's personal representative. He first taught Chiang Kai-shek to reopen negotiations with the Communist Party in Chongqing, and then flew to Yan'an to persuade the CCP to hand over its army to the Kuomintang Military Committee, which was personally controlled by Chiang Kai-shek, or to a three-person committee composed of one person from each party, the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, with Americans as commanders, after reaching an agreement with the Kuomintang. The exchange conditions were Chiang Kai-shek's "concessions" (?), such as recognizing the Communist Party as "legal" and allowing some of its members to serve as "members" in the Executive Yuan of the Chiang government—that is, allowing Communist Party members to "become officials" in the Chiang government. To show his "good intentions" (?) in promoting this agreement, Hurley repeatedly persuaded the Communist Party: Chiang Kai-shek was beyond redemption, the CCP were all patriots, and as long as they participated in the government, they could achieve great things and receive American relief and "cooperation." However, he evaded and postponed the democratic coalition government demanded by the Chinese Communist Party on behalf of the people. This American plan became the formula constantly used by Chiang Kai-shek later: "You hand over your army to me first, and then I will give you democracy." Hurley had been working for this from the winter of 1944 to the spring of 1945, but such an obvious and stupid deception, of course, could not fish out the people's armed forces, and it was determined that it would only be a complete bankruptcy.
    Between the spring and summer of 1945, the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army were fighting with all their strength behind enemy lines, and the overall war situation became even more unfavorable to Japan. The US government then changed its plan and adopted a "hard" approach. Hurley and Wedemeyer still came forward, first to slander the Communist Party. In the same Hurley's mouth, Chiang Kai-shek became a "democratic" "leader," while the CCP became "destructive" and "conspiratorial." On April 2, Hurley, in his capacity as the US Ambassador to China, formally announced in Washington: The United States "only cooperates with Chiang Kai-shek and does not cooperate with the Communist Party," and wants to help Chiang Kai-shek forcibly "unify" China (Note: See the American magazine China Political Stalemate, April 20, 1945, and Hurley's conversation on the same month and day.). Wedemeyer also instructed all American officers in China "not to help those individuals or groups that do not belong to the Chongqing government." He also continued to provide Chiang Kai-shek with a large amount of materials and successively equipped twenty divisions of "American-equipped" Chiang troops, attempting to force the CCP to retreat with this, and at the same time, prepared to seize the fruits of the anti-Japanese war from the people by chance. However, since intimidation did not work, and Japan announced its surrender in August, the situation completely changed, and this move by the United States had to lose its expected effect again.
    Four. Exclusive Occupation of China
    (After 1945, i.e., after Japan's surrender)
    On August 10, 1945, Japan announced its unconditional surrender to China, the Soviet Union, Britain, and the United States. The Japanese aggressors, who had oppressed China for more than seventy years, were finally defeated, and the Chinese people's eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan ended victoriously. However, the Chinese nation did not achieve complete independence from then on, and the crisis of China being completely colonized became even more serious, because World War II made the United States, which mainly competed with Japan for hegemony in China, become the "strongest" country in the world's weakened capitalist system, full of ambition to seize world hegemony. In China, it successively overwhelmed all its competing enemies, from the once-powerful Britain, France, Germany, and Russia to the later rampant and invincible Japan, and began to exclusively occupy China. In this entire undertaking, only one thing remained unfinished, that is, to finally conquer the Chinese people—first of all, to eliminate the Chinese Communist Party. Although this was a "task" that it could never complete, it was continuing to make doubled efforts in all aspects for this purpose, in conjunction with its Chinese running dogs. Turning China completely into a colony has already become a forever unchanging policy in the subjective wishes of American imperialism.

　　美国侵华史
    三　争夺中国霸权　（续二十四）
    刘大年
    这是美国侵略者，想以断送中国民族革命战争为代价，从日本手中取得“满洲国”除外的中国，既对美国毫无牺牲，又可以美日汪蒋合作把中国人民打下去，自是美国最理想的方案。一九四一年整个夏季，美国曾“竭尽全力，树立此项基础”（注：美国白皮书。），罗斯福还为此“希望与近卫公爵作三日左右之会谈”（注：近卫前书，六十页）。驻日大使格鲁也向美国拍回了一个“开始外交官生活以来最重要之电报”（注：同前书，七一页）。在此情况下，美国走狗蒋介石曾由他的驻美大使胡适交给罗斯福一封信，说：如果没有别的办法，“那中国便不能支持下去了”（注：梁明致译：十年来美国对华政策的错误，载东方杂志四四卷六号。），含蓄地表示出他对美国计划的同意，同时，还发动一个反共高潮，为对日投降作实际准备，但中国共产党领导人民对此坚决反对，而日本方面也认为在中国驻兵为日本陆军生命问题，绝对不能让步。结果美日谈判破裂。自一九一七年以来，美、日、英争夺中国霸权各种形式的斗争，至此，发展为一九四一年十二月开始的太平洋战争。
    太平洋战争爆发后，美国在中国一面用舆论公开批评蒋政府，及空口赞扬共产党的某些政治措施，好让中国人民军队去单独抵抗日本！一面继续给蒋介石更多物资援助，一九四二年二月七日“财政贷款”一项，即为五亿美元。同年六月又成立中美互助协定，陆续商定给蒋八亿七千万美元的租借物资。使蒋介石用来围困封锁“民主的中国”，它自己则同蒋介石一起坐在峨嵋山上观战。一九四三年初，日本正玩一滑稽把戏，要与汪精卫签订所谓中日新约，在日本军事占领中国条件下，“废除”日本享受的不平等条约，美国又与日本竞争，赶紧于一月十一日与蒋介石成立它原来要在“和平状态恢复之后”再谈的中美新约，（注：蒋介石：中国之命运，中正书局版，一一七页。）实行用和日本相同的方法来欺骗中国人民。
    战争持续到一九四四年，在世界战场上由于苏联对德全面反攻，希特勒崩溃迫在眉睫，也就使东方的日本，败局已成，美国侵略政策又开始重要变化，对日本准备采取保存侵略势力的“绥靖主义”，对中国则重新彻底支持蒋介石消灭中国人民革命力量——首先是消灭共产党领导的人民军队。是年十一月美国侵略者著名代表赫尔利与魏德迈来中国，及由他们代替高斯、史迪威为驻重庆大使和美军中国司令及蒋介石参谋长，便是这个政策已经确定的表现。但在执行方法上，美国已抛开老一套而出现许多新的花样。它开头第一步，是拿交换条件，请中共把武装交出来。最初赫尔利以罗斯福总统私人代表名义来中国，先到重庆教给蒋介石与共产党重开谈判，然后又飞往延安敦劝中共经过与国民党成立协定，把军队交给由蒋介石亲自掌握的国民党军事委员会，或者是美国人充当统帅国共各派一人组成的三人委员会指挥。交换条件则是蒋介石“让步”（？），如承认共产党为“合法”，并可派出若干人在蒋政府行政院担任“委员”——即允许共产党员在蒋政府“做官”。赫尔利为表示他促成这个协定的“好意”（？），对共产党方面再三劝说：蒋介石已无可救药，中共都是爱国分子，只要参加政府，便可大有作为，且能得到美国的救济与“合作”。而对中国共产党代表全国人民所要求实现的民主联合政府却一味回避推延。美国这一方案，成了蒋介石后来不断使用的公式即：“你先交出军队给我，然后我就给你以民主。”一九四四年冬到四五年春天，赫尔利一直为此活动，但这般明显而又愚蠢的骗局，当然不能就把人民的武力钓出来，确定它只有完全破产。
    一九四五年春夏之间，八路军与新四军在敌后全力作战，整个战争形势更加于日本不利，美政府便变更计划，来一个“硬的办法”。还是由赫尔利与魏德迈出面，首先对共产党加以污蔑，在同一个赫尔利的嘴里，蒋介石又变成了“民主”的“领袖”，中共则变为“破坏”与“阴谋”，四月二日，赫尔利以美国驻华大使资格在华盛顿正式宣布：美国“只与蒋介石合作，不与共产党合作”，要帮助蒋介石武力“统一”中国（注：参看一九四五年四月二十日，美国杂志中国政治僵局，及同月二日赫尔利谈话。）。魏德迈也训令一切美国在华军官“不要帮助那些不属重庆政府的个人或团体”。又继续以物质大量供给蒋介石，及陆续装备二十个师的“美械化”蒋军，企图以此逼使中共退让，同时，也作相机从人民手中夺取抗日果实的准备。但恫吓既不发生作用，至八月间日本即宣布投降，局势全与改观，美国这一着，又不得不失去了它的预期效果。
    四　独占中国
    （一九四五年以后，即日本投降以后）
    一九四五年八月十日，日本宣布向中、苏、英、美四国无条件投降，压迫中国达七十余年之久的日本侵略者，终被打倒，中国人民坚持八年的抗日战争胜利结束。但中华民族并未从此完全独立，中国彻底殖民地化的危机反更加严重，因为第二次世界大战，使主要与日本争夺中国霸权的美国，变成世界衰弱的资本主义体系中最“强大”的国家，充满猎取世界霸权野心。而在中国则把所有与它竞争的敌人，从过去好逞强梁的英、法、德、俄到后来猖狂不可一世的日本，都依次压倒，开始了独占中国，在这全部事业中，只剩下一件事没有完成，即最后征服中国人民——首先是消灭中国共产党。虽然这是它所永远不能完成的“任务”，它却为此正结合其中国走狗，从各方面加倍继续努力。把中国完全彻底变为殖民地，已经是美帝国主义主观愿望里一条永远不变的方针。
