    [This City News] Parts of the suburban areas of Ping City suffered severe flooding this year, resulting in a shortage of wheat seeds for farmers, making planting difficult. To address this, the Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative, in coordination with the Municipal People's Government's Suburban Work Committee and the Cooperative Bank's Business Department, is selling and loaning wheat seeds and fertilizer, and allocating "Red Letter" (insecticide). The Cooperative Bank has already purchased 200,000 jin of wheat seeds and 500,000 jin of manure. The Supply and Marketing Cooperative has purchased more than 374,300 jin of wheat seeds from Shimen and Baoding, and has also purchased 32 barrels of "Red Letter" from Tianjin (170 jin per barrel), which are now being transported to various districts. The distribution plan is as follows: 60,000 jin for the Nanyuan District, 58,791 jin for Fengtai, 40,000 jin for Xiyuan, 35,000 jin for Changxindian, 65,000 jin for Shijingshan, and 13,000 jin for Mentougou, totaling 281,791 jin. Ten barrels of "Red Letter" have already been allocated, and lending continues. This will play a significant role in resolving the difficulties faced by farmers and supporting agricultural production.
