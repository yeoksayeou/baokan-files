Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 20th: Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu sent the following reply today to the telegram of uprising from General Dong Qiwu of Suiyuan and others on September 19th:

General Dong Qiwu and all officers, soldiers, government workers, and people from all walks of life in the Suiyuan army under your leadership: After reading your statement of September 19th, your position is correct. Since General Fu Zuoyi led the peaceful liberation of Beiping, the people have expressed welcome, and the reactionaries have expressed opposition. The reactionaries also attempted to undermine the efforts of the Suiyuan military and civilians to achieve peaceful liberation, but ultimately failed. You have already led your troops in an uprising, breaking away from the reactionaries and standing on the side of the people. We hope that you will unite as one, strive for progress, reform the old system, implement new policies, and fight for the construction of a new Suiyuan for the people.

　　　　　　　　　　Mao Zedong　Zhu De　September 20, 1949

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 20th: Nie Rongzhen, Commander of the North China Military Region, and Bo Yibo, Political Commissar, sent a telegram today congratulating the peaceful liberation of Suiyuan. The telegram stated: General Dong Qiwu and all officers and men of the Suiyuan Uprising and administrative personnel at all levels:

Upon reading your telegram of September 19th, announcing your departure from the reactionary remnant groups of Chiang Kai-shek, Li Zongren, and Yan Xishan, who rely on American imperialism, and joining the ranks of the people's revolution, thus achieving the peaceful liberation of Suiyuan, we are greatly pleased and extend our warm congratulations. From now on, within the entire North China region, the stronghold that the Kuomintang reactionaries attempted to rely on for their final struggle has been declared eliminated. This is extremely beneficial to the cause of construction in the future of the entire North China region and to the cause of the North China military and civilians supporting the final victory of the national liberation war. The time for the complete elimination of the remnant groups of the Kuomintang reactionaries is near, and a brand-new People's Republic, creating a new era in China's five thousand years of history, has already been born. It is hoped that you will unite your subordinates and closely cooperate with the military and civilians of North China and the national liberated areas to stabilize local order, eliminate all remaining forces of the reactionaries, and, with the spirit of serving the people, educate the troops, transform their thinking, change their style, strive for progress, and build Suiyuan into a truly liberated people's area, and transform the army into a truly People's Liberation Army, to struggle for the construction of a new Suiyuan, a new North China, and the complete liberation of all of China.

    董其武将军及在贵将军领导下的绥远军队全体官兵、政府工作人员和各界同胞们：看了你们九月十九日的声明，你们的立场是正确的。自从傅作义将军领导北平和平解放后，人民表示欢迎，反动派表示反对。反动派还企图破坏绥远军民和平解放的努力，但是终归失败，你们已经率部起义，脱离反动派，站在人民方面了。希望你们团结一致，力求进步，改革旧制度，实行新政策，为建设人民的新绥远而奋斗。
