　　Workers Actively Repair After Flood
  　Tangshan Resumes Power Generation
  　Factories and Mines Throughout the City Resume Work
    [Tangshan Electric] After the Tangshan Branch of North China Electric Power Company's power plant was flooded, the majority of the machinery has been baked dry in the past half-month under the active repair of all employees. After careful inspection and repair by the workers, power generation was officially resumed at 6:00 PM on the 2nd. Factories and mines throughout the city have obtained sufficient power and have resumed production one after another. Factories that suffered from the flood have also begun to resume work. Except for the cloth weaving machines in the cloth factory section, all other workshops such as the carding and roving workshops of Huaxin Textile Factory have fully resumed work. The production departments of Qixin Cement Company are gradually recovering. The new large kiln that directly produces cement (the largest of the factory's eight large kilns) officially started operation on the 30th of last month. The employees are still continuing the repair work. The electromechanical plant and foundry department of Tangshan Steel Plant have completed the repair work successively. The steelmaking furnace of the steelmaking plant will also be repaired soon, and the rolling section can start work immediately after obtaining power.
