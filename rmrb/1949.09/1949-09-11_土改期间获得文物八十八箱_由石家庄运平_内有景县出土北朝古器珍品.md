　　Eighty-eight Cases of Cultural Relics Obtained During Land Reform
　　Transported from Shijiazhuang to Beiping
　　Includes Rare Northern Dynasties Artifacts Excavated from Jingxian
　　[Reported by this newspaper] The Ministry of Education of the North China People's Government, on the 1st of this month, transported eighty-eight cases of cultural relics previously obtained during the land reform (including those from the former Jin-Cha-Ji and Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region governments) and those excavated and salvaged, from Shijiazhuang to Beiping and handed them over to the Beiping History Museum for preservation. The museum, starting from the 5th, together with the personnel escorting the relics, began opening the cases for inventory. Experts and scholars in Beiping were invited to authenticate them. These cultural relics include pottery figurines, bronzes, and porcelain unearthed in Jingxian, Hebei; pottery li-tripods, pottery pots, and taotie-patterned semi-cylindrical tiles unearthed in the Lower Capital of Yan; bronze pots unearthed in Yanggao; and famous paintings, calligraphy, and porcelain collected during the land reform. Among them, the ancient artifacts unearthed in Jingxian are the most precious. The male and female figurines can be used to study the evolution of Han, Wei, and Six Dynasties costumes. The carved flower zun and high-footed plates among the porcelain can elucidate the special style of Six Dynasties porcelain, which is helpful for the study of the history of Chinese ceramics. The History Museum originally opened the "Special Exhibition of Cultural Relics Donated by the People After Liberation" and the "Special Exhibition of Newly Collected Cultural Relics After Liberation" in recent days. After receiving this batch of extremely valuable cultural relics, it hurriedly opened the "Special Exhibition of Cultural Relics Unearthed from the Feng Family Tomb of the Northern Dynasties in Jingxian" for the appreciation and research of the general public.

　　土改期间获得文物八十八箱
　  由石家庄运平
    内有景县出土北朝古器珍品
    【本报讯】华北人民政府教育部于本月一日，将前在土改期中获得的文物（包括前晋察冀、晋冀鲁豫边区政府）与发掘和抢救的文物一批共八十八箱（内有图书三十箱），由石家庄运平，拨交北平历史博物馆保藏。该馆于五日起，会同这次护运的人员开箱点收。并邀请在平的专家、学者鉴定。这批文物有河北景县出土的陶俑，铜器，磁器。燕下都出土的陶鬲，陶壶，饕餮纹半瓦当，以及阳高出土的铜壶，与土改中收获的字画陶瓷等名贵东西。其中以景县出土的古器物为最珍贵。其中的男俑女俑，可资研究汉魏六朝服饰的演变，瓷中的雕花樽，高足盘，可阐明六朝瓷器的特殊风格，有助于中国陶磁史的研究。历史博物馆本来在近日开辟了“解放后人民捐赠文物特展”，“解放后新收文物特展”，得到这一批极宝贵的文物后，又赶忙开辟“景县北朝封氏墓出土文物特展”，以供人民大众的欣赏和研究。  （王黎晖）
