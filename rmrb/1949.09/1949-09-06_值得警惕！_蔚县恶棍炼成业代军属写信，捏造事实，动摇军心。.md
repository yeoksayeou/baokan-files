　　Worthy of Vigilance!
　　Weixian County Villain Lian Chengye, Acting as a Military Family Member, Writes Letters, Fabricating Facts, and Shaking Military Morale.
    [Our Newspaper's Report] Recently, in Weixian County, Chahar Province, it was discovered that bad people were writing letters on behalf of military family members to soldiers at the front, fabricating situations and shaking military morale. Comrade Lian Wuirui, a political instructor in a certain unit and a native of Taohuabao, Weixian County, reported to the Ministry of Civil Affairs that he had received a letter from his mother stating that she was begging for food at home and was not receiving any care from the village. The Ministry of Civil Affairs immediately sent a letter to the Weixian County government, ordering it to investigate and handle the matter. According to the Weixian County government's investigation report, Comrade Lian's claims were completely inconsistent with the facts. Lian's family originally owned seven mu of land. This spring, during the land reform, they were allocated an additional five mu of land, plus another one mu of military family land, for a total of thirteen mu of land. All the cultivation and tending of these thirteen mu of land were done by the village on their behalf. Furthermore, the crops were growing well. In addition, his mother also earned some income by washing clothes for others, and his younger brother earned more than two dou (over 80 *jin* in market weight) of rice this year by pulling seedlings and selling his labor. Therefore, their family's life was not worse than that of ordinary farmers. But why did Comrade Lian receive a letter from his mother saying that she was begging for food at home? After in-depth investigation, it was found that this matter was fabricated by the bad guy Lian Chengye when Lian's mother asked him to write the letter. Lian Chengye had served the enemy during the Kuomintang era. He was a notorious troublemaker, opium addict, layabout, and extremely reactionary, and he had always disagreed with the village head. His purpose in writing this distorted letter was to try to provoke a conflict between Comrade Lian and the village head. The impact of this would be to shake the morale of the soldiers at the front. The Ministry of Civil Affairs has now ordered the Weixian County government to strictly investigate and prosecute this matter. There are still many such destructive elements hidden in various places. It is hoped that all localities will raise their vigilance, expose their reactionary conspiracies in a timely manner, and give them the punishment they deserve.

　　值得警惕！
　  蔚县恶棍炼成业代军属写信，捏造事实，动摇军心。
    【本报讯】察哈尔省蔚县近查出坏人代军属给前方战士写信，竟捏造情况，动摇军心。某部队指导员炼武瑞同志，蔚县桃花堡人，曾向民政部反映，他接其母亲函谓：母在家中乞食，村中毫无照顾。民政部随即致函蔚县县政府，令其调查处理。据蔚县县政府的调查回报称：炼同志所称的情况与事实完全不符。按炼同志家中原有土地七亩，今春土改中又调剂分给土地五亩，加上另种旁的军属地一亩，共计有土地十三亩。这十三亩地的一切耕种锄耨，都是村中给代耕的。并且庄稼长的也不错。加以其母又替人拆洗衣物，其弟拔苗卖工，今年也挣下二斗多米（市秤八十多斤）。因此，他家的生活，较之一般农民并不算坏。但为什么炼同志竟接到其母亲在家乞食的来信呢？经深入调查后，查出此事乃是坏家伙炼成业当炼母托其写信时所捏造的。炼成业在国民党时代曾侍奉过敌人；是个大讼棍、大烟鬼、不务正业的流氓，反动异常，素与村长意见不合。他写这封歪曲事实信的目的，是在企图挑拨炼同志与村长的关系。其影响是会动摇前方的军心的。现民政部已令蔚县县政府对此事严予追究讯办。象这样隐伏在各地的破坏分子，尚不知有多少，深望各地提高警惕，及时揭发其反动阴谋，给予应得的惩戒。
