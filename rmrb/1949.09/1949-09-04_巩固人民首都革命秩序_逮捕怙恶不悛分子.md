Consolidate the Revolutionary Order of the People's Capital
Arrest the Obstinate and Unrepentant Elements
The person in charge of the Public Security Bureau solemnly stated: Self-renewal registration is the only path to new life for reactionary party members and secret agents. If they are stubborn and unrepentant, the government will resolutely suppress them.

[This City News] Reactionary party members who attempt to undermine government decrees, resist registration, or continue to engage in covert activities after registration, determined to be enemies of the people, have been successively arrested and brought to justice by the Municipal Public Security Bureau. The person in charge of the bureau recently solemnly stated: "In today's victory of the revolution, 'self-renewal registration' is the only path to new life for reactionary party members and secret agents under the lenient policy of the People's Government. More than 3,000 people have already followed the measures announced by the Military Control Commission, carried out registration, and are doing work to atone for their crimes under the lenient policy of the People's Government. However, there are still a few elements who, regarding this lenient call from the People's Government, do not know how to repent and thoroughly correct their past mistakes. They harbor ulterior motives and adopt an attitude of hostility towards the people's revolutionary cause through observing, concealing, deceiving, and delaying, stubbornly denying and evading registration. Some are even obstinate and unrepentant, daring to undermine the registration work, attempting to rise again when the opportunity arises. These die-hard counter-revolutionary elements will forever isolate themselves from the people. The Public Security Bureau, in order to safeguard revolutionary order and the interests of the people, will never allow any reactionary party members and secret agents to run rampant and continue to carry out destructive activities. After doing everything humanly possible for these counter-revolutionary elements, the only option is to develop the authority of the people's democratic dictatorship and resolutely arrest and suppress them, giving them the punishment they deserve." As of August 31, the bureau had arrested a total of 235 reactionary party members who resisted registration and continued to do evil, including Li Shengpu, a member of the Democratic Socialist Party, who firmly refused to register, destroyed the registration office, and injured staff members. Cui Zhiqiang, the leader of the 11th group of the Peiping District of the Party Statistics Bureau (i.e., the Central Statistics Bureau) of the Kuomintang, resisted and undermined registration, intimidated and obstructed other reactionary elements from registering, and arranged for false registration. Ma Zhengchen, a secret agent of the Secrecy Bureau who evaded registration and colluded with reactionary party members to conspire to flee. Zhou Jidao, the chairman of the pseudo-reform faction of the Youth Party, who surrendered to the enemy during the Anti-Japanese War and served as the director and counselor of the puppet Ministry of Agriculture and Mines of the Wang Jingwei government, resisted registration and took the opportunity to exploit loopholes. Li Xiangdong of the Democratic Socialist Party engaged in conspiracy activities after registration.
