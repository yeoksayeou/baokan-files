　　Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Representative Visit Report
  　Ever-Victorious General Su Yu
    Jin Feng
    "General Su Yu wins every battle; he is one of the most outstanding generals in the People's Liberation Army." While the reporter was interviewing General Su Yu, General Liu Bocheng, who was sitting beside him, looked at General Su Yu with great admiration and exclaimed this.
    The reporter remembered that people called General Su Yu the Ever-Victorious General.
    This has its historical origin.
    In 1946, the Kuomintang reactionaries tore up the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference and dispatched 500,000 American-equipped troops to attack the Liberated Areas. At that time, General Su Yu, who was the commander of the New Fourth Army's Central China Field Army, led his troops in coordination with the militia to resist the enemy on the southern front of Central Jiangsu, winning seven battles in seven victories, head-on strikes against the enemy's rampant attacks, greatly boosting and strengthening the determination and confidence of the military and civilians in our Liberated Areas to defeat and finally eliminate the Chiang bandits, winning time for our army to prepare for war, and creating a brilliant example for the military and civilians in the Liberated Areas to carry out self-defense warfare, specifically embodying Chairman Mao's operational principles for carrying out self-defense warfare: seizing time, striving for strategic initiative, not taking the gains and losses of a city or place as an indicator of victory or defeat, and focusing on the ebb and flow of enemy and our forces—in these seven battles and seven victories, General Su Yu decisively threw off the burden of "defending cities and falling into a strategically passive position," taking big steps backward and then big steps forward, striving for the initiative in combat, and using one-tenth of the enemy's forces to eliminate 45 percent of the invading Chiang bandit army of 150,000 in forty-five days, seizing a large number of American-made military supplies, and liberating a large number of Chiang bandit officers and soldiers to arm and strengthen the people's army. At this time, the old folks in Taixian County, northern Jiangsu, presented General Su Yu with a plaque that read "Commander Su fights battles, and wins every battle." The newspapers in the Liberated Areas all published news of his series of victories. The people told each other, "Our People's Liberation Army has produced another Ever-Victorious General, Commander Su!"
    At the end of 1946, Commander Su's troops and the Shandong Field Army, personally led by General Chen Yi, joined forces to form the East China Field Army. Commander Su then assisted General Chen Yi in commanding the entire East China battlefield. The first battle was in the Subei area, where they annihilated the Kuomintang's 69th Army led by Dai Zhigi. Then, in the Lunan area, they annihilated the Ma Liwu Rapid Column, which the Chiang family bandits boasted about. In February 1947, in the Battle of Laiwu in Shandong, they annihilated seven divisions of the Kuomintang army, captured the bandit leader Li Xianzhu alive, and shattered the Chiang bandit army's dream of focusing its attack on the Shandong Liberated Area to eliminate the East China Liberation Army. In mid-June, they launched the famous Battle of Menglianggu, annihilating the 74th Division, which was known as the Chiang family's iron army, and killing its commander, Zhang Lingfu. From then on, the war was led into the Chiang area. In early September, they annihilated the 57th Army of the Chiang army led by Duan Linmao in southwestern Shandong, opening up and establishing the Yuwansu Liberated Area. In the winter of 1947, they attacked the Longhai Railway and the Pinghan Railway, echoing the Liu-Deng army from afar. In July 1948, in the Battle of Suiqi (the Battle of Eastern Henan), they captured the Chiang bandit's 5th Corps Commander, Qu Shounian. This battle marked the beginning of the East China Field Army's large-scale annihilation of the enemy from the inner line to the outer line. In September of the same year, General Su Yu personally commanded the capture of Jinan, which was defended by more than 100,000 Kuomintang troops and was known as the "copper wall and iron bastion," in eight days, capturing the war criminal Wang Yaowu alive. This battle became a turning point in the strategic war of liberation on the East China battlefield. At the end of the year, General Su Yu led the Third Field Army in conjunction with the Second Field Army and the Central Plains troops to jointly carry out the unprecedented Huaihai Campaign in the War of Liberation, creating the brilliant result of annihilating more than 600,000 enemy troops in sixty-five days. The two major field armies successively annihilated the Huang Baitao Corps, killing Huang Baitao, annihilating the Huang Wei Corps, capturing Huang Wei alive, and finally encircling and annihilating the three corps of Du Yuming—Sun Yuanliang, Li Mi, and Qiu Qingquan—capturing Du Yuming alive. This April, after the Kuomintang reactionaries finally rejected peace negotiations and cut themselves off from all Chinese people, Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu issued an order to advance on April 20th, and the Second Field Army was waiting on the riverbank. General Su Yu again led his troops, and on the night of receiving the order to advance, ten thousand ships set sail together, breaking through the river defense, and capturing Nanjing, the Kuomintang capital, on the 23rd. Together with the Second Field Army, they took advantage of the victory to advance south along the Beijing-Hangzhou National Highway, completely annihilating eight armies of the Kuomintang bandit army with Nanjing as the core of defense. On the evening of May 24, they attacked Shanghai, which was built with steel and concrete fortifications by the Chiang bandits in collusion with American imperialism and boasted as "Stalingrad." Under the heroic combat of our army and the powerful firepower, in less than three days, they completely liberated Shanghai, which had been the center of imperialist aggression in the Far East for a hundred years. Sweeping away the remnants of the enemy on the southeastern battlefield, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui were all liberated soon after, and most of Fujian was also liberated. At this point, the East China battlefield was completely changed. The flags of the People's Liberation Army were planted all over most of the East China region, and the Kuomintang remnants were completely pressed to the seaside mountains, leaving only nine islands and ports such as Xiamen, Taiwan, and Zhoushan.
    This series of victorious achievements shows that General Su Yu deserves this glorious title given to him by the people.
    The reporter asked about General Su Yu's experience as an old Red Army soldier for twenty-two years:
    He said that twenty-three years ago, he was an eighteen-year-old member of the Communist Youth League and a student of the disbanded Hunan Second Normal School who was wanted by the Kuomintang. That year (1927), he joined the student team of the Fourth Army Independent Regiment under the command of the late General Ye Ting in Wuchang. Later, he joined the Communist Party of China. In the autumn of the same year, he participated in the famous Nanchang Uprising and became one of the first glorious Red Army soldiers in China. From then on, he followed Commander-in-Chief Zhu and became a people's soldier for twenty-three years.
    He had worked in the people's army at all levels, from squad leader to company commander, instructor, battalion, regiment, division, army commander, and political commissar at all levels, chief of staff of the corps, commander of the corps, and commander and political commissar of the military region. Now he is the deputy commander and deputy political commissar of the Third Field Army of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the East China Military Region. He not only deeply understands the situation of his own troops, but also pays close attention to studying the enemy's situation, terrain, and mass conditions. He often reads and memorizes maps and investigates various situations. He often said, "Fighting is like doing mathematics." The soldiers would follow him to fight with peace of mind. They often said, "It's really happy and reassuring to fight with Commander Su Yu, and we never lose battles." Now, General Su Yu turned the topic back to talking about the stories of him following Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu to Jinggang Mountain and the Jiangxi Soviet. He said that the more than 3,000 people on the mountain had crushed the four encirclements and suppressions of the enemy's hundreds of thousands of troops. He said that the Red Army had been fighting hard from the very beginning, showing its invincible bravery. He recalled that after the "September 18th" Incident, the Chinese Communist Party called on the whole country to resist Japan. The Northern Anti-Japanese Vanguard Detachment was first dispatched from Jiangxi, and he was the chief of staff of Commander Fang Zhimin of the detachment, but unfortunately, Comrade Fang Zhimin was arrested and died heroically. General Su Yu was silent for a while when he spoke here, and his bright eyes dimmed. He was silently mourning for his close comrade-in-arms. Raising his head, he continued to recount that he continued to lead the remaining troops of the Fang department as commander, and insisted on the three-year guerrilla war in the Zhejiang-Jiangxi-Fujian border area and continued the work of the anti-Japanese united front. General Su Yu commemorated and completed the last wishes of Comrade Fang Zhimin with heroic actions. In 1938, the New Fourth Army was established, and he led the anti-Japanese vanguard detachment temporarily compiled into a detachment, first arrived in Jiangnan, bringing the hope of victory to the dull hearts of Jiangnan people, and the anti-Japanese flames were lit all over the mountainous countryside of Jiangnan close to the enemy and puppet heartland. From then on, the New Fourth Army and the Eighth Route Army echoed each other from north to south, becoming the nemesis of the Japanese invaders in China. After the New Fourth Army marched eastward, the Subei Headquarters was established, and he served as the deputy commander. After the Southern Anhui Incident, Commander Chen Duan went to the Subei Military Region, and he began to independently preside over the opening up and construction of the anti-Japanese democratic base area in central Jiangsu with the new position of commander and political commissar of the New Fourth Army's First Division and commander and political commissar of the Central Jiangsu Military Region, leading the military and civilians of Central Jiangsu to persist in the struggle against the enemy. In 1942 alone, he fought more than 500 battles, successively crushing countless cruel attacks by the enemy's "clearing the countryside," "political clearing the countryside," "highly clearing the countryside," and "extended clearing the countryside," and constantly expanding the liberated areas, developing directly to the Jiangsu-Zhejiang border area.
    General Su Yu talked about how after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War in 1945, the Jiangzhe Military Region troops under his command had liberated the coastal counties of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, but in order to strive for the realization of national democracy and peace, they had to reluctantly bid farewell to the people of Jiangnan, leaving a promise to "come back soon," and resolutely led their troops to withdraw north.
    Speaking of this, he paused for a moment, and then smiled and said, "Now we have really returned to Jiangnan. We will continue to advance south and directly attack Taiwan!" General Su Yu said, "I understand very well that everyone is naturally concerned because Taiwan is the last piece of land under Kuomintang reactionary rule, and they are worried that Taiwan is an island, which is not easy to attack. Thank you for your concern and worries. We have enough determination and confidence. Recalling the beginning of the People's Liberation War, the enemy's strength was 4.3 million, and our field army had only 400,000 to 500,000. In the past three years, our army has won more with less, and the situation of the enemy being strong and we being weak has been reversed to the enemy being weak and we being strong. Now, the remaining enemy in Taiwan is only tens of thousands, and our army alone exceeds the enemy by dozens of times in terms of quantity. Other political, economic, and national support forces are hundreds of times stronger than the enemy. With the combined efforts of the national manpower, material resources, and our heroic and good-fighting Liberation Army to attack this Taiwan, which is smaller than China's smallest province, accounting for only one-half of Zhejiang, and the enemy's internal enemies are betraying each other, people can understand that this is not a problem. Speaking here, General Su Yu said with the perseverance and calmness of a soldier, "After we have completed our preparations, our Liberation Army will immediately implement and complete this task that the people of the whole country unanimously hope for, just like crossing the river to liberate Nanjing and Shanghai." Finally, General Su Yu, who always wins battles, said with optimism and confidence: "They can see that in a short period of time, the flag of the new China, which is to be formulated by this CPPCC, can be flying in Taiwan!"

　　中国人民政协代表访问记
  　常胜将军粟裕
    金凤
    “粟裕将军百战百胜，是解放军最优秀的将领之一”。在记者访问粟裕将军的时候，坐在一旁的刘伯承将军满怀着喜欢望着粟裕将军，发出这样的赞叹。
    记者记起了人们是称粟裕将军为常胜将军的。
    这是有它的历史渊源的。
    一九四六年国民党反动派撕毁了政协决议，调遣了五十万美式配备的大军进攻解放区。当时担任着新四军华中野战军司令员的粟裕将军，率领所部配合民兵在苏中南线抗击敌人，七战七捷，迎头痛击了敌人的猖狂，大大振奋和加强了我解放区军民战胜和最后消灭蒋匪的决心和信心，争取了我军准备战争的时间，造成了解放区军民进行自卫战的光辉范例，具体体现了毛主席关于进行自卫战的作战原则：争取时间，争取战略上的主动地位，不以一城一地的得失为胜负的指标，着重在敌我力量的消长——在这七战七捷的作战中，粟裕将军果决地摔掉“防守城市使战略上陷于被动地位”的包袱，大踏步后退又大踏步前进，争取了作战的主动，并以一对十的兵力在四十五天的时间内消灭了来犯蒋匪军十五万的百分之四十五，夺获了大批美造军火，解放了大批蒋匪官兵来武装和壮大了人民的军队。这时候，苏北泰县的老百姓送给粟裕将军的匾上写了“粟司令打仗，仗仗胜”，解放区的报纸都登载着他的一连串打胜仗的消息，老百姓们互相告诉着：“咱们解放军又出了一位常胜将军粟司令！”
    在一九四六年年底，粟司令所部与陈毅将军亲率的山东野战军，会合组成华东野战军，而后粟司令就协助陈毅将军指挥整个华东战场的作战。首战于宿北地区，消灭国民党六十九军载之奇部，继于鲁南地区消灭了蒋家匪军所夸称的马励武快速纵队，一九四七年二月在山东莱芜一役又消灭国民党军七个师，生擒匪首李仙洲，击碎了蒋匪军重点进攻山东解放区消灭华东解放军的梦想。六月中又进行了著名的孟良崮战役，消灭了素称为蒋家铁军的七十四师，击毙该师师长张灵甫，从此将战争引向蒋区，九月初在鲁西南消灭了蒋军五十七军段霖茂，开辟建立了豫皖苏解放区，一九四七年冬破击陇海路平汉路，与刘邓大军遥相呼应。一九四八年七月睢汜之战（豫东大战）俘虏了蒋匪五兵团司令区寿年，这一战役是华东野战军由内线转到外线作战大规模歼灭敌人的开始。同年九月粟裕将军又亲自指挥以八天的时间打下了所谓：“铜墙铁壁”有十多万国民党军队防守的济南，生俘战犯王耀武。这一仗更成为华东战场解放战争战略的转折点。年底，粟裕将军统率了第三野战军协同第二野战军及中原部队共同进行了解放战争中规模空前的淮海战役，造成了六十五天消灭敌军六十余万的辉煌战果。两大野战军先后歼灭了黄伯韬兵团，击毙了黄伯韬，歼灭了黄维兵团活捉了黄维，最后包围和消灭了杜聿明所部三个兵团——孙元良，李弥，邱清泉，活捉了杜聿明。今年四月，国民党反动派最后拒绝和平谈判，自绝于一切国人之后，四月二十日毛主席朱总司令下了进军令与第二野战军同在江边待命，粟裕将军又统率所部，于接获进军令的当夜，万船齐发，突破江防，廿三日攻占国民党首都南京，协同第二野战军乘胜沿京杭国道向南挺进，全歼了以南京为防守核心的国民党匪军八个军。五月二十四日晚又进攻了蒋匪勾结美帝以钢骨水泥建筑了防御工事，自夸为“史大林格勒”的上海，在我军英勇作战及强大炮火威力下，不到三天，全部解放了这百年来成为帝国主义侵略远东的中心——上海。扫荡着东南战场的残敌，不久苏、浙、皖全部解放，福建也大部解放。至此，华东战场完全改观，大部华东地区遍插了解放军旗，国民党残敌完全被压向海边山间，只剩下厦门、台湾、舟山等九个海岛和港口。
    这一系列胜利的业绩，说明了粟裕将军是当得起人民送给他的这一光荣的称号的。
    记者问起了粟裕将军这二十二年的老红军的经历：
    他说到二十三年前他是一个十八岁的共产主义青年团员，也是一个被解散了的湖南第二师范学校的，被国民党通缉的学生，那一年（一九二七年）他就在武昌参加了故叶挺将军所部的第四军独立团的学生队，后来又加入中国共产党，同年秋参加了著名的南昌暴动，成为中国最初的光荣的红军的一个，从此就跟定了朱总司令，当了二十三年的人民子弟兵。
    他在人民的军队里各级工作都干过，从班长到连长，指导员、营、团、师、军长及各级政委，兵团参谋长、兵团司令到军区司令和政委，现在则是中国人民解放军第三野战军兼华东军区的副司令员、兼副政治委员，他不仅深切了解自己部队的情况，又很注意研究敌情、地形和群众情况，经常阅读并默记地图，调查研究各种情况。他常常说：“作战就是算数学。”战士们都会放心地跟着他打仗。他们常常说：“跟粟裕司令打仗真高兴，又安心，从来不会打败仗。”现在，粟裕将军又回过话头来谈到他跟着毛主席朱总司令上井岗山和江西苏维埃时的故事，他说在山上的三千多人曾粉碎了敌人数十万大军四次的围剿，他说红军从一开始就是这样艰苦奋斗，显出了它的无敌英勇来的。他回忆到“九一八”爆发后，中共号召全国抗日，从江西首先出动了北上抗日先遣队，他就是该队司令方志敏同志的参谋长，但不幸方志敏同志被捕壮烈牺牲了。粟裕将军谈到这里沉默了好一会，炯炯发光的眼睛黯淡了，他在为他的亲密的战友默默哀悼。抬起头来，他继续追述下去，那就是他继续带了方部所余部队继任司令，即在浙赣闽边区坚持了三年的游击战争并继续抗日统一战线工作，粟裕将军就以英勇的行动，来纪念和完成方志敏同志的遗志。一九三八年新四军成立，他带着抗日先遣队暂编为一个支队，首先到达江南，给江南沉闷的人心带来了胜利的希望，漫天抗日烽火遂点燃在江南紧靠敌伪心腹的山乡水国。从此新四军和八路军南北呼应，成为日寇在中国遇到的倒头星。新四军东进后，成立苏北指挥部，他担任副指挥，皖南惨案发生，总指挥陈段去苏北军部，他就以新四军一师师长兼苏中军区司令兼政委的新职开始独立主持苏中抗日民主根据地的开辟与建设工作，领导着苏中的军民坚持对敌斗争。仅一九四二年一年，即作战五百余次，先后粉碎了敌寇的“清乡”、“政治清乡”、“高度清乡”、“延期清乡”等无数次残酷的进攻，并不断扩大了解放区，直发展到江浙边区。
    粟裕将军谈到他在一九四五年抗日胜利以后，他所部的江浙军区部队就曾解放了江浙沿海的县城，但为了争取全国民主和平的实现，不得不忍痛告别江南人民，留下了“不久就要回来”的允诺，毅然率部北撤。
    说到这里，他停顿片刻，旋即笑着说道：“现在我们是真的回到江南来了。我们还要继续南进，直捣台湾！”粟裕将军说：“我很明白，大家关心的自然是因为台湾是国民党反动统治的最后一片土了，担心的是台湾是一个海岛，有不易进攻的条件。谢谢大家的关心和担心，我们是有足够的决心和信心的。回想到人民解放战争开始时，敌人的兵力是四百三十万，我方野战军只有四五十万人，三年来我军以少胜多，由敌强我弱的形势扭转到敌弱我强；现在台湾残敌不过十数万，我军仅以数量上讲即超过敌人几十倍，其他政治、经济及全国支援力量较之敌人则何啻强大几百倍。以全国的人力、物力加上我英勇善战的解放军合力来进攻这个还不到中国最小省份、只占浙江二分之一，而敌人内部又众叛亲离的台湾，人们可以明白这是不成问题的。说到这里，粟裕将军带着军人的坚毅沉着地说：“待我们准备完成以后，我解放军定会象渡江解放南京上海一样立即执行和完成这项全国人民所一致希望的任务的。”最后，这位常打胜仗的粟裕将军充满了乐观和信心这样说了：“他们可以看到，在短时期内，台湾就可以飘扬着此次人民政协所要制定的新中国的国旗了！”
