Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 3rd -- Xie Xuehong, Chairman of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League, issued a statement today regarding the U.S. imperialist attempt to annex Taiwan, saying: I represent the 6.7 million people of Taiwan in declaring our firm opposition to the U.S. imperialist plot to annex Taiwan. The people of Taiwan, who have already suffered 51 years of enslavement by Japanese invaders and more than four years of devastation by the Kuomintang bandit gang, will never allow U.S. imperialism to enslave them again. Today, the Chinese people are about to achieve nationwide victory, the Chinese mainland is about to be completely liberated, and the day of Taiwan's liberation is not far off. All the people of Taiwan are awaiting the arrival of this day with joyful hearts. It is futile for U.S. imperialism to try to obstruct and undermine Taiwan's liberation. Any plot to invade Taiwan will inevitably be met with resolute blows from the people of Taiwan and the people of the whole country. Today, the Chinese people have the power to smash any U.S. imperialist plot of aggression.

Xie Xuehong exposed the history of U.S. imperialist aggression against Taiwan, saying: U.S. imperialism's aggression against Taiwan has a history of nearly a hundred years. In 1847, the United States sent troops to assist Japan in attacking Taiwan, supplying the Japanese army with munitions and ships to massacre the Taiwanese people. In 1857, the commander of the U.S. naval fleet stationed in Hong Kong, Amsron, attempted to establish a colonial-style "independent country" in Taiwan. In 1895, during the Treaty of Shimonoseki negotiations, the U.S. government supported Japan's demand to cede Taiwan. After Japan's surrender, U.S. imperialism meticulously planned to take Japan's place in Taiwan and replace it. On the one hand, U.S. imperialism colluded with the Kuomintang bandit gang to obtain air and naval bases in Taiwan, controlling Taiwan's industrial and mining enterprises and economic lifeline, making the people of Taiwan live a life of suffering. On the other hand, it actively instigated a small group of Taiwanese scum, such as Liao Wenyi, to carry out so-called "Taiwan independence movement" conspiracies in order to further turn Taiwan into an American colony. However, because the people of Taiwan and the Chinese people had long seen through their trickery, the activities of this small group of national scum led by Liao Wenyi did not produce the results hoped for by their American masters. Recently, due to the rapid development of the Chinese revolutionary war, the time for the People's Liberation Army to liberate Taiwan is drawing closer day by day, and the American imperialists are becoming increasingly anxious, publicly clamoring to "occupy Taiwan." News from various sources has it that the U.S. government has issued a note to the Kuomintang government in Guangzhou, stating that it wants to "take over Taiwan as part of the U.S. occupied territory in the Pacific." We do not know by what right the U.S. government dares to entertain the wishful thinking of invading and occupying Chinese territory of Taiwan.

Xie Xuehong affirmed: The U.S. imperialist plot to invade and occupy Taiwan is bound to fail. The people of Taiwan have been constantly fighting against invaders for three hundred years. Now the People's Liberation Army is marching towards South China and has liberated Fuzhou. The liberation of Taiwan is not far off. The people of Taiwan will join the people of the whole country and the People's Liberation Army in resolutely wiping out the remnants of the Kuomintang bandit gang in Taiwan and expelling the aggressive forces of U.S. imperialism, and strive to build a new, democratic Taiwan and a new China.

　　台湾民主自治同盟主席谢雪红声明
  　反对美帝侵我台湾阴谋
  　全台人民正以欢欣心情迎接解放
    【新华社北平三日电】台湾民主自治同盟主席谢雪红今日对美帝国主义企图吞并台湾的阴谋活动发表声明说：我代表全台六百七十万人民声明，坚决反对美帝国主义企图吞并台湾的阴谋。已经饱受了日本侵略者五十一年奴役和国民党匪帮四年多蹂躏的台湾人民，决不再让美帝国主义来奴役他们。今天中国人民即将取得全国胜利，中国大陆即将完全解放，台湾解放的日子已为期不远了，全台人民都以欢欣的心情等待着这个日子的到来。美帝国主义要想阻挠和破坏台湾的解放，那是徒然的。任何侵略台湾的阴谋，必将遭受台湾人民和全国人民的坚决打击。今天中国人民已有力量粉碎美帝国主义的任何侵略阴谋。
    谢雪红揭露美帝国主义侵略台湾的历史说：美帝国主义对台湾的侵略，已有近百年的历史了。一八四七年美国曾出兵协助日本进攻台湾，以军火、船舰供应日本军队屠杀台湾人民。一八五七年，美国驻香港海军舰队司令亚门司龙曾企图在台湾建立一个殖民地式的“独立国”。一八九五年在马关条约谈判中美国政府又支持日本割让台湾的要求。日本投降以后，美帝国主义更处心积虑，想取日本在台湾的地位而代之。美帝国主义一方面勾结国民党匪帮取得了台湾的海空军基地，控制了台湾的工矿事业和经济命脉，使台湾人民过着痛苦的生活；另一方面，它积极策动台湾一小撮败类如廖文毅之流进行所谓“台湾独立运动”的阴谋活动，以便进一步将台湾变为美国殖民地。但由于台湾人民和中国人民早已洞烛其奸，廖文毅这一小撮民族败类的活动并未产生如其美国主子所希望的结果。最近由于中国革命战争的迅速发展，人民解放军解放台湾的时间一天天逼近，美国帝国主义者越发着急了，就公开发出“占领台湾”的叫嚣来。各方消息盛传美国政府已向国民党广州政府发出照会，说它要“接管台湾作为太平洋美国占领区的一部分”。我们不知道美国政府凭什么权利竟敢作侵占中国领土台湾的痴心妄想。
    谢雪红肯定地说：美帝国主义侵占台湾的阴谋一定要失败的。台湾人民三百年来就不断地与侵略者进行着斗争，现在人民解放军正向华南进军，并已解放了福州，台湾的解放是不久了。台湾人民将与全国人民和人民解放军在一起，坚决肃清台湾的国民党匪帮残余并驱逐美帝国主义的侵略势力，为建设人民民主的新台湾和新中国而努力。
