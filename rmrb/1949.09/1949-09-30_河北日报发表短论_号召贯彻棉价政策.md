【Baoding Telegram】The Hebei Daily recently published a short article, calling for "Guaranteeing the interests of cotton farmers and implementing the cotton price policy." The short article, addressing the phenomenon of violations of the government's cotton price policy that have occurred in some areas, and the exploitation of farmers by unscrupulous merchants who purchase cotton at low prices, first pointed out: The cotton procurement task is a production task, and all business departments must, under the unified leadership of the Party and the government, closely cooperate with the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company as the center, resolutely implement the cotton price policy, and guarantee the interests of farmers. Regarding private merchants, we should vigorously publicize our cotton price policy to make them voluntarily accept and implement it; and we should use economic methods to control reasonable prices in various places so that speculative merchants have no opportunity to exploit. It further pointed out: Through the task of purchasing cotton, we must vigorously develop cooperatives, and pay attention to selecting superior cotton seeds for promotion next year to improve cotton quality.
