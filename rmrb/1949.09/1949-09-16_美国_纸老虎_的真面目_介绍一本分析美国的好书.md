　　The True Face of the American "Paper Tiger"
    ——Introducing a Good Book Analyzing America
    Wang Ning
    Book Title: The American Handbook Editor: Bernhard
    We attack the reaction of American imperialists, attacking America as a war-monger serving Wall Street; but we also praise the American Communist Party and progressive people for their struggle for democracy and peace, and we welcome the American black singer Paul Robeson. So, what kind of country is America? Why do American war-mongers dare to clamor like that? What methods does the reactionary American government use to maintain its rule? How much influence does the American Communist Party have among the people? What kind of person is Wallace? What kind of historical relationship has America had with China? Why are black people in America not treated as human beings by white people?… America, America, when we come into contact with the current international situation, when we think of the crimes committed against the Chinese people by the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries for so many years, we think of this country, this country that Chairman Mao calls a "paper tiger."
    Here is a book that I recommend to everyone, it will tell us the true face of the "paper tiger." Not only does it introduce the "paper tiger" for us to see, but it also tells us what kind of paper the "paper tiger" is made of, why it is made into that shape, and also exposes the paper skin of the paper tiger, pointing out its skeleton and its empty body to us. In other words, "The American Handbook" introduces America using the Marxist-Leninist viewpoint and critical methods. It tells us the inside story of American imperialism - the dark side of America; on the other hand, it tells us the true feelings of the American people - the bright side of America. It uses a question-and-answer style to explain to us one by one our various doubts about America; from the land to the people, from the "two-party system" to the "first lady," from the White House to the Liberty Bell, this book should be said to answer the questions about America and Americans that we generally think about. Of course, this book does not mention nylon stockings, American erotic music, or the capitalists' carnal farces, that is another issue.
    What exactly does this book write about? It writes about America's geography, history, economy, finance, military, political parties, labor unions, education, and publishing; it also writes about America's financial groups, America's progressive and reactionary groups, America's social problems, and Sino-American relations; finally, it introduces more than three hundred Americans that we often encounter in our daily lives.
    First of all, in the history chapter, this book tells us the true situation of America. It tells us that America externally "waves the banner of anti-Sovietism, practices expansion, interferes in the democratic movements of various countries, supports the reactionary rulers of the world, infringes upon the sovereignty of other countries and obtains military bases, and supports the revival of German and Japanese fascism, organizes new wars of aggression." Internally, "the behavior of Wall Street's 'one thousand people' enslaving the American and world people has been opposed by the American people, and under the leadership of the American Communist Party and the 'Progressive Party' established in July 1948, the working class and all oppressed people are gradually uniting to oppose Wall Street control." This is the real America, an America of reactionary and progressive struggles.
    How do America's "one thousand people" control America? This book tells us that the total assets of the United States (in 1938) were 253 billion yuan, and the 45 largest financial groups in the United States controlled 103.4 billion yuan; if we add the more than 200 large companies controlled by the financial groups, what other assets does America have besides the assets of the financial groups? No wonder "American financial groups not only control the American economy, but also control the government and the media. They are the real rulers of America."
    So how is the American government formed? This book tells us that the reactionary American government uses poll taxes, residency requirements, literacy tests, and property restrictions to restrict the people's right to vote; at the same time, it uses the number of signatures to restrict people from running for election. Of course, this does not include the threats and inducements of reactionary groups to voters. Should a government elected in this way be fed by the capitalists who manipulate it? But no, it is precisely the people with low incomes who feed this reactionary government. This book will tell you that millionaires can use bonds, villas as farms, various types of salaries and pensions, spouses can divide property, and they can use charitable donations and various other methods to evade taxation. And 57 percent of the income tax burden is borne by those earning less than 5,000 yuan per year, and they are also the main bearers of consumption taxes. As for the two-party politics and the huge government organization, they are all built on rumors, slander, intimidation, inducements, fines, imprisonment, and assassination, and are a well-known "spoils system."
    What about the American people? This book tells us that the adult population of the United States is more than 80 million, and there are often millions of unemployed people. Even employed workers, their economic situation is such that they "must borrow or reduce food before the end of the month." The situation of those who are semi-employed and unemployed is even more unimaginable. Therefore, from 1792 to the present, in these 150 years, the entire history of the United States is a history of proletarian struggle, a history of the people's struggle against the reactionary government. This book depicts these great scenes of struggle.
    We must not forget the American Communist Party - the vanguard of this proletarian struggle. Since its official establishment in 1921, it has participated in and led the American workers' movement, and the establishment of the American Progressive Party has also gone through some difficulties. The 150 progressive groups in the United States, as well as some other small progressive organizations, together with the peace-loving people of the United States, constitute the bright side of America. If you don't know how strong the progressive forces are in America, you will know, after reading this book, that even in the most reactionary imperialist country of America, there are still such great forces of peace-loving people.
    At the same time, this book exposes the most reactionary and ugliest side of America, the reactionary and fascist groups in America. In this book, you will learn what the "Ku Klux Klan," "Silver Shirts," and "German-American Bund" are. In this book, you will know how more than a thousand large and small fascist devils are using open, vicious, and terrifying methods to suppress the people, trying to prevent the progress of the American people and lead America to a reactionary and fascist path.
    In the so-called "civilized," world's richest, and "number one" in everything America, can you imagine: 190,000 people cannot find a place to live and have to sleep in cars or train stations. Can you imagine: black people being burned to death in broad daylight with welding torches, black people's eyes being gouged out, and groups entering black residential areas to destroy their houses. Can you imagine: there being 1.4 million criminal cases every year, and 190 million gallons of liquor being consumed every year. And this is America.
    But the American newspapers turn a blind eye to these things, because four newspaper trusts control American speech, and American journalists serve these newspapers.
    In this colorful America, let's not be dazzled. The authors of "The American Handbook" wrote this passage, which is the key to our understanding of America:
    "The contradiction between the productive forces and the relations of production in the American capitalist economy cannot be overcome. Economic panics erupt periodically, and the American economy has aged and is unable to recover from the panic of 1929, which was followed by the panic of 1937. After the war, panic will also follow temporary prosperity, and it is now approaching. Moreover, the American capitalist exploitation system makes the antagonism between the bourgeoisie and the working class increasingly sharp. The strength of the working class is strong, and its awareness is increasing, forcing American monopoly capital to take fascist control measures to maintain its vested interests. The class struggle within the United States will eventually bury the American capitalist economy. Finally, the foreign expansion policy of American monopoly capital infringes upon the interests of the capital of other imperialist countries, making the contradictions between the United States and other imperialist countries unavoidable, and the United States will become increasingly isolated internationally. All this is the most fundamental weakness of America."
    Finally, I separately present the chapter "Sino-American Diplomatic Relations" in this book. We are all too familiar with the historical facts narrated in this chapter, especially the events of the last one or two decades, or even the most recent years, which we have witnessed with our own eyes. From the beginning of the American ship "Empress of China" arriving in Guangzhou in 1784 until 1948, American imperialism used the "friendly" sugar-coating to deceive us, but we finally saw through it. The hideous face of the imperialists has gradually revealed itself in this century of history. "The American Handbook" narrates history from this point of view.
    This book is a reference book for us to consult at any time. After reading this book, it will help us understand the real America. And I want to repeat, it is a very good book that can be used to find American materials when analyzing American issues.

　　美国“纸老虎”的真面目
    ——介绍一本分析美国的好书
    王凝
    书名：美国手册主编者：柯柏年
    我们攻击美国帝国主义者底反动，攻击美国为华尔街服务的战争贩子；但我们又赞扬美国共产党与进步人民为民主和平的斗争，我们又欢迎美国黑人歌王罗伯逊。究竟，美国是一个怎样的国家呢？美国底战争贩子为什么敢于那样叫嚣？美国反动的政府用什么方法维持自己底统制呢？美国共产党在人民中有多大影响呢？华莱士到底是个怎样人物呢？美国与中国历史上有过什么样的历史关系呢？美国底黑人为什么被白人不当人看呢？………美国，美国，当我们一接触到目前的国际情势，一想到蒋介石反动派这么多年来对中国人民所犯的罪，我们就要想到这个国家，想到被毛主席称为“纸老虎”的这个国家。
    这里有一本书，我介绍给大家，它会告诉我们“纸老虎”底真面目。不但它把“纸老虎”介绍给我们看，而且它还告诉我们“纸老虎”是用什么纸糊的，为什么要糊成那个样子，并且还要把纸老虎底纸皮揭破，把它底骨架子，它底空空的身子一起指给我们看。换句话说，“美国手册”是用了马列主义的观点，批判的方法介绍了美国。它一方面告诉我们美帝——美国的黑暗面底内幕；另一方面告诉我们美国人民——美国的光明面底真情。它用问答的体裁，把我们对于美国的各种疑问，一一的解释给我们；由地到人，由“两党制度”到“第一夫人”，大至白宫小至自由钟，这本书应该说回答了我们一般人所想到的关于美国、美国人的问题。当然这本书中没说到玻瑙丝袜，没说到美国底色情音乐，没说到资本家们底肉欲闹剧，那是另一个问题。
    这本书究竟写了些什么呢？它写了美国底地理、历史、经济、财政、军事、政党、工会、教育、出版；也写了美国底财阀、美国底进步与反动团体、美国的社会问题及中美关系；最后还介绍了三百多个我们日常容易碰到的美国人给我们。
    首先在历史一章中，这本书就告诉我们美国底真实情况。它告诉我们美国对外“摇着反苏的幌子，实行扩张，干涉各国民主运动，支持全世界的反动统制者，侵犯别国主权及取得军事基地，扶助德、日法西斯主义的复活，组织新的侵略战争。”对内“华尔街的‘一千人’奴役美国和世界人民的行为，已经受到了美国国内人民的反对，在美国共产党领导下和一九四八年七月成立的‘进步党’领导下的工人阶级和一切被压迫人民，正在一步步团结起来反对华尔街统制。”这就是真实的美国，反动与进步斗争的美国。
    美国的“一千人”如何统制美国呢？这本书告诉我们美国全国资产（一九三八年）值二千五百三十亿元，而美国的四十五家大财阀就控制了一千零三十四亿元；假若再加上大财阀所支配的二百多个大公司，那么在美国除了财阀们底资产，美国还有什么资产呢？无怪“美国财阀不仅控制了美国经济，也控制了政府，言论出版机关。他们是美国真正的统治者。”
    那么美国政府又是怎样组成呢？这本书告诉我们美国的反动政府用了人头税、居住期限、识字测验、财产限制，限制住人民的选举权；同时以签名人数，来限制人民竞选。当然这还不算反动团体对投票人的威胁、利诱。这样选出的政府应该由操纵他的资本家来喂养吧？但不，喂养这个反动政府的正是收入低的人。这本书会告诉你，百万富翁他可以用债券，可以以别墅称作农场，可以用各种名目的薪金养老金名义，可以夫妻分产，可以用慈善捐助各色各样方法来逃避征税。而所得税的负担者百分之五十七都是每年五千元以下薪金的收入者，同时他们又是消费税的主要负担人。至于两党政治，庞大的政府组织，那全是靠了造谣、诽谤、威吓、利诱、罚款、监禁、暗杀等建立起来，是有名的“分赃制度”。
    美国的人民呢？这本书告诉我们美国成人人口有八千多万人，而失业者经常有几百万人。即令就业工人，他们底经济情况却是“不到月底就必须借债或减食”的。那些半就业者，失业者的情况就更不敢设想了。所以自一七九二年到现在，这一百五十几年中，美国的整个历史就是无产阶级斗争的历史，就是人民对反动政府的斗争史。这本书中对于这些伟大的斗争场面均有描绘。
    我们不能忘记美国底共产党——这无产阶级斗争的先锋队。自一九二一年正式建立以后，它就参加并领导了美国底工人运动，美国底进步党它底建立也是经过了若干困难的。美国底一百五十个进步团体，以及其他一些小的进步组织，这整个合起来，加上美国爱好和平的人民，便构成了美国底光明面。假若你不知道美国究竟进步力量有多大，你翻看了这本书，就会知道即令在最反动的美国帝国主义底国家内，爱好和平的人民还有这么大的力量。
    同时这本书揭露了美国底最反动、最丑恶的一面，美国底反动，法西斯团体。在这本书中，你会了解到什么是“三Ｋ党”“银衫团”“德美同盟会”。在这本书中你会知道一千多个大大小小的法西斯摩手怎样在用公开的、毒辣的、恐怖的手段压杀人民，企图阻止美国人民的进步，把美国引向反动，法西斯的道路。
    号称“文明”的，世界最富足的，每一样事情都是“第一”的美国，你会能想象到：十九万人找不到房子住，要睡在汽车里，睡在火车站里。你能想象到：光天化日之下把黑人用焊铁吹管烧死，把黑人眼睛挖去，集体进入黑人住区捣毁其房屋。你能想到：每年竟有一百四十万宗犯罪案，每年要消耗一亿九千万加仑的烈酒。而这就是美国。
    但美国的报纸对这些是熟视无赌的，因为四个报业托拉斯统制了美国的言论，美国的新闻记者是为这些报馆服务的。
    在这五花十色的美国中，我们别看花了头脑，“美国手册”的作者们写了这么一段话，这是我们要了解美国的总关键：
    “美国的资本主义的经济，其生产力与生产关系之间的矛盾是不能克服的，周期的爆发经济恐慌，而且美国经济已经衰老，没有能力从一九二九年的恐慌，恢复过来，就接着发生了一九三七年的恐慌。战后，恐慌也将跟着暂时的繁荣而来的，现已日益接近。还有美国资本主义的剥削制度，使资产阶级与工人阶级的敌对日益尖锐化，工人阶级的力量强大，觉悟提高，迫使美国独占资本不得不采取法西斯的统制手段来维持其既得利益。美国国内阶级斗争，终有一天会把美国的资本主义经济埋葬的。最后，美国独占资本底对外扩张政策，侵害了其他帝国主义国家的资本底利益，使美国与其他帝国主义国家之间的矛盾无法避免，美国在国际间将日益孤立寡助。这一切就是美国底最根本的弱点。”
    最后，我单独提出这书中的一章“中美外交关系”。这一章所叙的史实，我们都是太熟悉的，特别是近一二十年，甚至最近几年来的事情，都是我们用眼看着的。由一七八四年美船“中国皇后号”到广东开始，一直到一九四八年止，美帝曾用了“友善”的糖衣欺哄我们，但终于被我们看穿了。帝国主义者底狰狞面貌，在这一百年历史中是逐渐显露了出来。“美国手册”就在这一个观点上叙述了历史。
    这本书是一本供我们随时查阅的参考书，我们读了这本书，它会帮助我们了解到真实的美国。而且我要重复，它是一本很好的书，可供我们分析美国问题时查找美国材料。
