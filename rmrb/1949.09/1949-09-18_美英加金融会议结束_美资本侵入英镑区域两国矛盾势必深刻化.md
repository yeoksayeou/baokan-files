　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 16th: The US-UK-Canada financial conference, which began on September 7th in Washington and lasted for six days of secret negotiations, concluded on the 12th. This conference, which touted the rescue of the British crisis, was actually one where the United States took advantage of Britain's difficulties to sacrifice Britain in every possible way. At the end of the meeting, a communiqué was issued announcing a so-called "Ten-Point Plan." The content of the "Ten-Point Plan" shows that the dollar's offensive against the pound will continue to expand. According to the "Ten-Point Plan," US capital will seize the British investment market, "Trumanism" will extend to India and Egypt in the sterling area, and the United States will seize Britain's strategic materials (oil, rubber, lead), etc. One of the most important sell-outs by Cripps and Bevin was to encourage US capital to invest in the sterling area. To this end, at the Washington conference, the British representatives also promised that "Britain will eliminate investment barriers as much as possible." Encouraging the United States to invest in the sterling area means that, as Britain's economic situation continues to deteriorate, the United States is encouraged to export the crisis to the sterling area. In this way, the contradictions and struggles between the United States and Britain will inevitably become more profound. What did Britain get in the negotiations? The main item is that "the three countries will make 'greater efforts' to expand the dollar income of the sterling area." One of the ways to do this is for Britain to "strive to reduce production costs" so that "the products of the sterling area can stand in a competitive position." This is to further sacrifice the interests of the British working class. In addition, the United States has also allowed Britain to use Marshall Plan dollars in places other than the United States, which means that the United States has agreed that Britain can "freely" purchase Canadian wheat without necessarily purchasing American wheat. Although this is so insignificant, according to the Associated Press, "a spokesman for the United States Congress will express displeasure with this matter." The US-UK-Canada conference did not make a decision on the devaluation of the pound because the British representatives repeatedly pleaded at the meeting, requesting that the devaluation be postponed. The British government has released public opinion saying that devaluing the pound before the British general election is detrimental to the Attlee government, so the inevitable devaluation of the pound still has to wait a while. Although Wall Street did not force the pound to devalue immediately at the negotiating table, it did not relax its pressure at all. For example, after the end of the meeting, "it is said that most of the representatives of the US delegation believe that the real credit of the pound cannot be restored unless the pound is revalued together with other Western European currencies" (Associated Press).

### 美英加金融会议结束　美资本侵入英镑区域两国矛盾势必深刻化

　　美英加金融会议结束
  　美资本侵入英镑区域两国矛盾势必深刻化
    【新华社北平十六日电】九月七日开始在华盛顿举行的美英加三国金融会议，经过六天秘密谈判后，已于十二日结束。这一标榜解救英国危机的会议，实际上是一个美国利用英国的困难千方百计牺牲英国的会议。会议在结束后发表公报，宣布了一项所谓“十点计划”。“十点计划”的内容显示，美元对英镑攻势将继续扩大中。根据“十点计划”，美国资本将夺取英国的投资市场，“杜鲁门主义”将扩展到英镑区域的印度和埃及等地，美国将夺取英国的战略物资（石油、橡皮、铅）等等。克利浦斯和贝文最重要的一项出卖，是鼓励美国资本向英镑区域投资。为此，在华盛顿会议上，英国代表并承诺“英国将尽可能地消除投资的障碍”。鼓励美国向英镑区域投资，这就是说，在英国经济情势愈益恶化的时候，鼓励美国向英镑区域输出危机，这样，美英之间的矛盾与斗争势必随之更趋深刻化。英国在谈判中得到的是什么呢？主要的一项，是“三国将以‘更大的努力’以扩大英镑区域的美元收入”，其办法之一是要英国“努力减少生产成本”，从而“使英镑区域的产品能立于竞争的地位”。这就是要英国更进一步地牺牲英国工人阶级的利益。此外，美国又允许英国除在美国之外还可在其他地方使用马歇尔计划的美元，这就是说，美国答应英国可以“自由地”去采购加拿大的小麦，而不必一定采购美国的小麦了。这一点虽然如此微不足道，但是，据合众社说，“美国国会发言人将对此事表示不大愉快”。美英加会议对英镑贬值问题未作决定，因为英国代表在会上一再地苦苦哀求，要求允许暂缓贬值。英国政府放出舆论说，在英国大选之前使英镑贬值是不利于艾德礼政府的，因此，势在必行的英镑贬值还要稍待一下。华尔街虽然没有在会议桌上迫使英镑立即贬值，但是，它并没有放松一点压力，例如在会议结束之后，“据称，美国代表团的大多数代表都认为，英镑的真实信用是不能够恢复的，除非英镑与其他的西欧货币一起重新厘订价值”（合众社）。
