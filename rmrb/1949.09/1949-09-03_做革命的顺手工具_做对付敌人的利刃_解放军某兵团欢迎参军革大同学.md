　　[Reported by this newspaper] More than 500 students who recently graduated from the North China People's Revolutionary University and joined a certain corps of the People's Liberation Army are now studying at the corps's military and political cadre training class. The opening ceremony of the training class was held on August 18th. Commander Yang first welcomed the new recruits on behalf of the entire corps. He said, "The revolutionary army needs a large number of young intellectuals to improve its cultural and scientific knowledge level. Your arrival at the 20th Corps has added new strength and new blood to the 20th Corps. Therefore, we sincerely and warmly welcome you!" Commander Yang called on all students to be handy tools for the revolution and sharp blades against counter-revolutionaries, ready to be used wherever they are needed. Zhang Wenrong, the student representative, said in his reply that he would resolutely overcome all difficulties, learn from veteran comrades, learn from soldiers, and strive to improve and train himself for the construction of a modern national defense army.
