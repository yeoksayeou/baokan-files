Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 11th: The conspiracy of U.S. and British imperialism to invade our territories of Taiwan and Tibet has aroused widespread anger and opposition among the people of Shanghai, Hangzhou, and Henan. The Preparatory Committee of the Henan Provincial Federation of Trade Unions and the Preparatory Committee of the Henan Provincial Democratic Women's Federation jointly issued a statement on the 8th, expressing that the workers and women of Henan are determined to support the victorious advance of the People's Liberation Army with practical actions such as actively producing, supporting the front lines, and eliminating bandits and secret agents, to liberate Taiwan, liberate Tibet, liberate all of China, and liberate all brotherly nationalities on the motherland's soil. The Henan Provincial Working Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League and the Preparatory Committee of the Henan Provincial Democratic Youth Federation also issued a statement saying: "Taiwan, which was recovered from the Japanese invaders through the long-term bloody struggle of the Chinese people, must not be turned into a colony of U.S. imperialism again; the Tibetan nationality is an integral part of the Chinese nation, and no foreign country will be allowed to divide it."

Over a thousand employees of the Shanghai French Water and Electricity Company unanimously expressed their firm opposition to the conspiracy of British and American imperialism to annex Tibet at the inaugural meeting of the company's trade union on September 3rd. The workers shouted slogans such as "Oppose the invasion of Tibet by British and American imperialism," "Drive British and American imperialists out of Tibet," and "Intensify production, support the front lines, and liberate all of China."

Employees of the Hangzhou Power Plant launched a wide-ranging discussion on the conspiracy of U.S. imperialism to invade Taiwan. Zhao Bencheng, a worker at the plant, said: "Taiwan is a part of China. We seriously warn U.S. imperialism that if you do not quickly abandon this idea, you will be met with utter defeat." Twelve workers from the Zhejiang Transportation Administration also sent a letter to the Zhejiang Daily expressing their determination to do everything in their power to support the People's Liberation Army, quickly liberate all of China, and shatter the conspiracy of British and American imperialism to annex Taiwan and Tibet.
