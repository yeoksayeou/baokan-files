Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, September 2nd: The Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China convened the first Provincial Party Congress in Wuchang on August 13th. Two hundred and sixty-three representatives from various regional committees, the Yichang and Shashi Municipal Committees, and units directly under the Provincial Committee attended. The meeting lasted for fifteen days and successfully concluded on August 27th. Lin Biao, Secretary of the Central China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, Deng Zihui, Deputy Secretary, and Li Xuefeng, Director of the Organization Department, attended and spoke at the meeting. The main task of the meeting was, based on the specific conditions of Hubei Province, to discuss how to implement the policy of the Central China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee of prioritizing rural work while taking into account cities, and to clearly formulate concrete methods and steps for implementation. At the beginning of the meeting, Lin Biao, Li Xiannian, and others gave reports on strengthening rural work and the work guidelines for suppressing bandits and opposing local bullies in Hubei Province. After repeated discussions in groups and at the plenary session, the meeting unanimously agreed with the policy of the Central China Bureau and determined that, in the future, the entire province should focus on suppressing bandits, opposing local bullies, and mobilizing the masses for a relatively long period.

The meeting thoroughly analyzed the specific conditions of Hubei Province. Currently, the situation in Hubei is that most areas of the province, except for a few counties in the southwest that are still occupied by the enemy, have been declared liberated; however, apart from a few areas that were liberated earlier, where bandits have been largely suppressed and the struggle against local bullies has been carried out, most are newly liberated areas this year. Although these new areas have crushed the upper-level organizations of the Kuomintang reactionaries, bandit and secret agent armed forces are still widespread, and feudal forces still dominate most rural areas in political, economic, military, and ideological aspects. Local bullies, bandits, and secret agents, integrated as one, directly or indirectly control rural political power, and they are systematically carrying out armed resistance and covert sabotage (such as spreading rumors, resisting the payment of public grain, etc.), causing social disorder and continuing to heavily exploit and oppress the masses. Due to the above circumstances, various policies and decrees of the People's Government cannot be smoothly implemented in the vast rural areas, causing great difficulties in supporting the war, connecting urban and rural areas, and production and construction. At present, the cities in Hubei are generally commercial and consumer cities, which are economically fragile, and their grain and industrial raw materials must be obtained from rural areas, and the vast market for industrial products is also in rural areas. Therefore, to develop and prosper the cities of Hubei and to transform consumer cities into production cities, it is also necessary to first do a good job in rural work and gradually eliminate feudal forces in rural areas.

Mobilizing the masses to overthrow feudal forces is the foundation for a century-long plan.
At present, work focuses on suppressing bandits.

Based on the current situation in Hubei Province, the meeting fully agreed with Lin Biao's point at the opening of the meeting that the primary task of Hubei Province at present is to lay a solid foundation. This is a work related to a century-long plan. The specific content of laying the foundation is to thoroughly overthrow feudal forces and thoroughly mobilize the masses. Only when the masses are mobilized, feudal forces are completely eliminated, and the foundation is laid can various construction works be vigorously carried out on this basis. The meeting thoroughly discussed the specific steps of the current work in Hubei Province, believing that bandit suppression must be the center of all work throughout the province, and other tasks should be carried out in conjunction with bandit suppression. The meeting pointed out that to truly do a good job in bandit suppression, it is necessary to let go of mobilizing the masses under the guidance of the party's correct policies, create a mass bandit suppression movement, and seek to quickly and thoroughly eliminate bandits. However, in local areas, where bandits have been largely suppressed and the environment is relatively stable, the focus can be on opposing local bullies, while also paying attention to eliminating scattered and hidden bandits. In areas where bandits have been eliminated and the struggle against local bullies has been carried out, the rent reduction and interest reduction movement can be carried out. The meeting also pointed out that it is necessary to recognize that bandit suppression and opposition to local bullies are essentially two aspects of the same problem and cannot be mechanically separated. The meeting studied the policies and work lines, work methods, and other issues of bandit suppression and opposition to local bullies. First of all, in terms of policy, it is necessary to correctly implement the principle of "punishing the ringleaders, not questioning the coerced, and rewarding meritorious service," strictly prohibiting deviations such as random beatings and killings or unprincipled "leniency," and at the same time, ethnic industrial and commercial enterprises must be protected in the mass movement against local bullies. On the work line, it is necessary to rely on poor peasants and farm laborers, consolidate the unity of middle peasants, and neutralize all forces that can be neutralized, so that poor peasants form the backbone force in rural areas, creating preconditions for land reform and urban construction in the next stage. During the meeting, the erroneous ideas of arrogance, complacency, and negligence of the enemy in the past bandit suppression work of cadres in various places were heavily criticized, such as failing to recognize the reactionary nature of the collusion between bandits, the Kuomintang reactionaries, and local feudal forces; only seeing bandits in groups, treating scattered and hidden bandits as petty thieves, and thinking that they were not worth mentioning, etc. In order to thoroughly complete the historical task of anti-banditry and anti-local bullies, the meeting decided that it is necessary to rectify our own ranks, draw a clear line between classes, resolutely cleanse bandits, secret agents, and local bully elements who have infiltrated the revolutionary ranks, eliminate the ideas of enjoyment and degeneration and serious corruption and waste phenomena in some cadres, improve the political consciousness and political vigilance of cadres and soldiers, and crush all enemy provocations, sabotage, and restoration conspiracies.

In addition, the meeting also discussed urban work and financial and economic issues. The meeting pointed out that during this period, it is necessary to take into account the cities at the same time. Urban work mainly relies on the working class and earnestly implements the policy of giving consideration to both public and private interests and benefiting both labor and capital, and restoring and developing production. Regarding financial and economic issues, the meeting believed that there are great financial difficulties at present, but these difficulties in victory can be overcome. On the one hand, it is necessary to increase financial revenue, such as collecting autumn public grain and strengthening taxation and trade; on the other hand, it is necessary to save financial expenditures, oppose corruption and waste, universally carry out the movement of streamlining and thrift, implement the streamlining of institutions, enrich grass-roots work, organize institutions, troops, and schools to engage in production, improve living conditions, and increase social wealth.

　　贯彻加强农村工作兼顾城市的方针
  　湖北召开第一次党代表会议
    【新华社汉口二日电】中共湖北省委会于八月十三日在武昌召开全省第一次党代表会议。出席各地委、宜昌、沙市市委及省委直属单位等代表二百六十三名。会议历时十五日，于八月二十七日胜利闭幕。中共中央华中局书记林彪、副书记邓子恢、组织部长李雪峰等都曾出席讲话。会议的主要任务是根据湖北省的具体情况，讨论如何贯彻中共中央华中局的先以农村为工作重点同时兼顾城市的方针，明确订出具体实施的方法和步骤。会议开始，由林彪、李先念等作了关于加强农村工作和湖北省剿匪反恶霸的工作方针的报告。经过小组和大会的反复讨论，会议一致同意华中局的方针，并确定：今后全省要在较长的时间内，以剿匪、反恶霸、发动群众为一切工作之中心。
    会议曾详细分析了湖北省的具体情况。目前湖北的情况是全省除西南部少数县份尚为敌人盘踞外，绝大部分地区已宣告解放；但其中除了少数地区解放时间较早，土匪大体肃清，并已进行过反恶霸斗争外，大部为今年解放的新区。这些新区虽然已把国民党反动派的上层组织摧垮了，但土匪特务武装还普遍存在，封建势力仍旧在政治、经济、军事、思想各方面统治着大部分农村，恶霸、土匪、特务三位一体直接或间接地掌握着乡村政权，他们有计划地进行着武装抵抗和暗中破坏（如造谣、抗交公粮等）活动，造成社会秩序的混乱，并继续苛重地剥削与压迫群众。由于以上情况，人民政府各种政策法令不能在广大农村中顺利推行，使支援战争、城乡沟通及生产建设等工作遇到很大困难。目前湖北的城市一般均属商业性和消费性的城市，它在经济上是脆弱的，粮食和工业原料都要取给于农村，工业生产品的广大市场也在农村。因此，要开展与繁荣湖北的城市，要变消费城市为生产城市，也必须首先作好农村工作，逐步地消灭农村的封建势力。
    发动群众打倒封建势力是奠定百年大计的基础
    目前工作以剿匪为中心
    根据湖北省目前情况，会议完全同意林彪在会议开幕时所指出的，湖北省目前的首要工作就是要打好基础。这是一个关系百年大计的工作。打基础的具体内容就是彻底打倒封建势力，彻底发动群众。只有在群众发动起来了，封建势力澈底消灭了，基础打好了，才可能在这基础上大力地展开各种建设工作。会议详细讨论了湖北省目前工作的具体步骤，认为在全省范围内必须以剿匪为中心，其他工作都与剿匪结合着进行。会议指出：要把剿匪工作真正做得好，必须在党的正确政策指导下，放手发动群众，造成群众性的剿匪运动，求得迅速彻底剿灭土匪。但在局部地区，股匪大体被肃清，环境已较为安定，则可以反恶霸为重点，同时注意肃清散匪潜匪。而在土匪已经肃清并进行过反恶霸斗争的地区，则即可进行减租减息运动。会议并指出：必须认识剿匪、反恶霸实质上是一个问题的两个方面，不能机械地分割开来。会议研究了剿匪反恶霸的政策和工作路线、工作方法等问题。首先在政策上，必须正确执行“首恶必办，胁从不问，立功受奖”的原则，严禁乱打乱杀或无原则的“宽大”等偏向，同时在反恶霸的群众运动中必须保护民族工商业。在工作路线上，必须依靠贫农、雇农，巩固的团结中农，中立一切可以中立的力量，使贫苦农民形成农村的骨干力量，为下一阶段的土地改革与建设城市创造前提条件。会议中着重批判了各地干部在过去剿匪工作中骄傲自满，麻痹轻敌的错误思想，如不认识土匪、国民党反动派和地方封建势力互相勾结的反动性；只看见成股土匪，把散匪潜匪看成小偷，认为不算回事等。为了澈底完成反匪反恶霸这一历史任务，会议决定：必须整顿自己的队伍，划清阶级界限，坚决清洗混入革命队伍内部的土匪特务和恶霸分子，肃清在部分干部中的享乐蜕化思想和严重的贪污浪费现象，提高干部与战士的政治觉悟与政治警惕性，粉碎敌人一切挑拨破坏和复辟阴谋。
    此外，会议并讨论了城市工作与财经工作诸问题。会议指出：在这一时期内，必须同时兼顾城市，城市工作主要是依靠工人阶级，切实执行公私兼顾、劳资两利政策，恢复和发展生产。对财经问题，会议认为目前财政上是有很大困难的，而这个胜利中的困难是能够克服的。一方面要增进财政收入，如征求秋季公粮及加强税收和贸易等；另一方面要节省财政开支，反对贪污浪费，普遍开展精简节约运动，实行机关精干化，充实下层工作，组织机关部队学校进行生产，改善生活，增加社会财富。
