Introduction of Work Experience of Employees of a Certain Ordnance Factory in Wuchang City

Regarding the work of factory employees, two typical examples, good and bad, have emerged in Wuhan. The trade union work group and administration of a certain ordnance factory in Wuchang City combined, sought truth from facts, and connected with the masses, turning a dilapidated factory into a vibrant one, achieving relatively successful experience. However, the work group of the Hubei Machinery Factory, due to adopting an acute administrative order-style working method and pursuing superficial achievements, became detached from the masses.

When the Wuhan Military Control Commission began taking over a certain ordnance factory in Wuchang, the factory was in a state of disorder and dilapidation, because the machines had been dismantled and moved away by the White bandits. In addition, due to rising prices and rumors spread by special agents, the workers had no confidence in restoring production, and their morale was quite low. After the trade union work group arrived at the factory, it cooperated with the military representatives to carry out education among the employees, targeting the above-mentioned situation. The military representatives also expressed to the employees their determination to rebuild the factory and successively distributed living allowances and wages to stabilize the workers' lives. Subsequently, the work group, through activists, launched a movement among the employees to contribute machines and tools to rebuild the factory and restore production. Many workers found their own hammers, files, and wrenches for the factory to use when it started work. As the factory had no machines, the workers borrowed lathes and bench vises; without power, worker Mao Shuiqing donated his own stored motor. In this way, the factory, which had been dismantled and scattered by the White bandits, began to come alive. Batches of ammunition were repaired and sent to the front lines. After seeing their own strength and achievements, the workers gained more confidence in restoring production and began to have the desire to organize. Study groups, cooperatives, and preparatory committees for the trade union were successively established. In particular, the establishment of the preparatory committee for the trade union enabled the factory's production, learning, welfare, and other work to be advanced in an organized and planned manner. The method of carrying out employee work in this factory is worthy of promotion and learning. (1) Close cooperation between military representatives and trade union work groups. Soon after the work group arrived at the factory, a work committee composed of military representatives, the work group, and nine factory representatives was formed. However, at the beginning, the coordination between administrative work and trade union work was not close, and there were even frequent conflicts. At the same time, the work committee had too many people and could not hold meetings in time to solve problems. After this shortcoming was discovered, the work committee was changed to be composed of the military representatives, the head of the work group, and the factory director, and a certain working system was established. In this way, the intentions of the administration and the work group could be quickly and closely coordinated. When workers wanted to establish a cooperative, the work group and the administration jointly discussed it and allocated houses, lent transportation tools, and provided start-up funds. The military representatives also repeatedly explained the importance of trade union work at employee meetings, which enhanced the prestige of the work group among the employees. The work group also made mobilizing and organizing workers to complete production tasks as the center of its work.

(2) Boldly rely on the working class, trust and utilize activists, and continuously educate and cultivate them. The work group first paid attention to cultivating the prestige of underground Communist Party members and activists influenced by the underground Communist Party among the masses in the factory, educating them to take the lead in various tasks, promote the spirit of mutual assistance, and solve some of the workers' difficulties in learning and life. This enabled them to make rapid progress, and they were generally elected as employee representatives and members of the preparatory committee of the trade union. After the establishment of the preparatory committee of the trade union, some of the activists who were elected as members were too busy with trade union affairs and left their production posts without going through the administration, which caused dissatisfaction among the employees. The workers gossiped behind their backs, saying, "They have become officials and don't want us anymore." After this phenomenon was discovered, the work group convened a meeting of the preparatory committee and activists, pointing out that the members of the preparatory committee should not be detached from production and from the masses, and told them how to mobilize the masses to complete tasks. It also stipulated that each member of the preparatory committee and activist should unite a group of people to correct the phenomenon of activists being detached from the masses.

(3) Carry out criticism and self-criticism from top to bottom and inside and outside. A certain director of the gun repair workshop had serious bureaucratic habits and was arrogant towards the workers. Everyone criticized him, causing him to admit his mistakes. The administration's investigation of the damage to firearms in the warehouse was not accurate, which delayed work. After the workers raised their opinions, the military representatives made a review at the general meeting. When workers in the commando team were repairing guns in a certain warehouse, they were eager to complete the task and some repairs were not up to standard. After the person in charge of the warehouse raised his opinions, the workers held a meeting in the evening to review. It was found that the quality of work had decreased because the technical proficiency of each group was too disparate, and those with poor skills were only pursuing quantity. After the review, the groups were reorganized, and the next day, the guns were repaired better and faster.

(4) The work group should not take over everything; let the employees do what they can. After the establishment of the preparatory committee of the trade union, the work group only provided leadership and control in principle; the heads of the preparatory committee were responsible for chairing meetings, arranging tasks, and summarizing work. Members of the production, welfare, organization, and propaganda departments all did their work within their own authority. Each department of the preparatory committee of the trade union hired activists with prestige among the masses as staff in each workshop. Therefore, once each task of the preparatory committee was arranged, it could quickly organize the employees for discussion through the members and staff of each department and become a conscious work for everyone to carry out. For example, the work of the cooperative in collecting shares was completed quickly because of the propaganda and education of the welfare staff among the employees.

The work group and other responsible persons of a certain factory in Wuchang City carried out responsible and detailed work with a spirit of seeking truth from facts and connecting with the masses, which is the main reason why they achieved real work results.

The method of carrying out employee work in the Hubei Machinery General Factory in Wuhan City is completely different from that of a certain ordnance factory in Wuchang City. In less than two months, the trade union in the factory established learning groups, cooperatives, factory protection squads, employee representative meetings, preparatory committees of the trade union, factory management committees, and other organizations, and developed more than 30 trade union members. However, the employees' class consciousness has not been improved as it should be with the establishment of various organizations. On the contrary, because too many organizations were established and too few problems were solved, it caused confusion in the masses' thinking. For example, when employees had not clearly recognized the close relationship between preventing spies and their own interests, the trade union work group did not carry out education and propaganda, and arranged for the establishment of factory protection squads, which made the employees afraid to participate for a while. The cooperative did not take into account the actual situation of the employees and insisted on deducting cooperative shares when paying wages, which caused dissatisfaction among the employees. Not only did everyone not pay shares, but it also greatly affected the mood of production and learning.

The reason for the failure of the trade union work in the factory is that the members of the trade union work group were coercive, detached from the masses, and pursued and satisfied with superficial achievements. Some members of the trade union not only failed to take the lead in production, but also engaged in sectarianism and disunity, which caused dissatisfaction among the masses. The work group was busy counting figures, writing reports, writing newsletters, and reflecting superficial achievements. On the day the list of trade union members was officially announced, the employees were not in high spirits, and the saboteurs took the opportunity to tear down the slogans praising active producers; but the work group was only busy asking the factory for money to buy firecrackers to make a lively scene at the meeting. The work group in the factory took a detour from the beginning in mobilizing the masses, and the superior leaders, without in-depth investigation, thought that the group was good and instructed the group to sort out and publish the experience of organizational work; and decided to make the factory one of the key points for the establishment of cooperative branches. The persons responsible for the trade union work also repeatedly went to give speeches, and researchers of workers' movements in various departments and journalists also went to interview and collect materials, and once praised it in the newspaper. This further aroused the complacency of the head of the work group, and he always focused on showing achievements. But in fact, since the working methods of the head of the work group were formalistic and detached from the masses, these so-called achievements were self-deceptive upon in-depth investigation.

### 武昌市某兵工厂　职工工作经验介绍

　　武昌市某兵工厂
  　职工工作经验介绍
    关于工厂职工工作，武津市出现了好坏不同的两个典型实例。武昌某兵工厂工会工作组和行政结合，实事求是，联系群众，把一个原本破烂不堪的工厂，闹得生气勃勃，取得比较成功的经验。而湖北机械工厂的工作组，由于采取急性的行政命令式的工作方法，追求表面成绩，结果脱离群众。
    武昌某兵工厂在武汉军管会开始接管时，厂内秩序紊乱，破烂不堪，因为机器已被白匪军拆卸搬走，加以当时物价上涨，特务造谣，工人对恢复生产没有信心，情绪相当低落。工会工作组到厂后，即配合军事代表，针对上述情况在职工中展开教育工作。军事代表亦向职工提出重建工厂的决心，并先后发放生活维持费和工资，使工人生活安定下来。接着，工作组即通过积极分子，在职工群众中掀起了献机器、献工具的重建工厂恢复生产运动。许多工人找出自己的榔头、锉刀、扳手供工厂开工使用。厂里没有机器，工人们就去借来了车床、老虎钳；没有动力，工人毛水清就捐献了自己存藏的马达。这样，被白匪拆毁得七零八落的工厂，开始生气勃勃了。一批批枪弹修配完竣，送上前线。工人看到自己的力量和成绩后，对恢复生产更增加了信心，并开始产生了组织起来的要求，学习小组、合作社和职工筹委会都先后成立了。尤其是职工筹委会的成立，使该厂的生产、学习、福利等工作，开始能够有组织有计划地向前推进。该厂进行职工工作的方法，很值得提倡和学习。（一）是军事代表与工会工作组密切配合。工作组到厂不久，即由军事代表、工作组，与厂方共九人组成工作委员会，但开始时行政工作与职工会工作配合还不密切，甚至常有抵触。同时工作委员会人数太多，不能及时开会解决问题。这个缺点经发觉后，工作委员会即改由军事代表，工作组长与工厂厂长三人组成，并建立了一定工作制度。这样，行政与工作组意图就可以迅速地密切地配合起来。工人要成立合作社，工作组与行政上共同商量后，即拨出房子、借给运输工具与开办经费。军事代表并多次在职工大会上说明工会工作的重要，提高了工作组在职工中的威信。工作组也把发动组织工人，完成生产任务作为工作中心。
    （二）大胆依靠工人阶级，相信和运用积极分子，并不断加以教育和培养。工作组首先注意培养该厂中共地下党员与在中共地下党影响下的积极分子在群众中的威信，教育其在各种工作上起带头作用，发扬互助精神，解决工人中一些学习上、生活上的困难。这样使得他们很快地得到进步，一般地都被选为职工代表与职工会筹委会委员。在工会筹委会成立后，当选委员的积极分子中有为忙于工会事情，不通过行政就脱离生产岗位的现象，致引起职工群众的不满，工人们在背后说闲话：“做官了，不要我们了。”这现象经发觉后，工作组即召开筹委会与积极分子会议，指出筹委会委员不能脱离生产、脱离群众，并告诉他们怎样推动群众来完成任务，又规定每个筹委、积极分子都要团结一批群众，把积极分子脱离群众的现象纠正过来。
    （三）上下内外展开批评与自我批评。修枪间某主任犯有严重的官僚习气，对工人态度傲慢。大家就对他进行批评，使他承认错误。行政上对存在仓库中的枪械损坏情况调查不确实，致耽误工作，工人提出意见后，军事代表即在大会上进行检讨。突击队工人在某仓库修枪时为急于完成任务，有些修得不够标准，经仓库负责人员提出意见，工人即在晚上开会检讨。发现工作质量降低，是由于各组技术熟练程度太悬殊，技术差的光追求数量。检讨后，即重新划分小组，第二天，枪修得又好又快。
    （四）工作组不能包办代替，职工群众能办的事尽量让他们办。在成立职工会筹委会后，工作组只作原则上的领导和掌握；开会、布置任务、总结工作等都由筹委会负责人自己主持。生产、福利、组织、宣传等委员都在自己职权范围内作好应做的工作。职工会筹委会的各股在各工作间都聘请了积极的在群众中有威信的工人为干事。因此，筹委会的每个任务一经布置下来，就能很快地通过各股委员、干事组织职工大家讨论，成为大家自觉进行的工作。如合作社征收股金等工作就是因为通过福利干事在职工中的宣传教育而很快地完成了。
    武昌某工厂的工作组和其他负责人以实事求是、联系群众的精神进行了负责的、细致的工作，就是他们收得真正的工作成绩的主要原因。
    　　　　　　×　　　　　　　　×　　　　　　　　×
    武汉市湖北机械总厂进行职工工作的方法，和武昌某兵工厂完全不同。该厂工会在不到两个月时间内，就成立了学习小组、合作社、护厂纠察队、职工代表会、职工会筹委会、厂务管理委员会等等组织，发展了三十余个职工会会员。但职工的阶级觉悟，并未能随着种种组织的建立而得到应有的提高。相反的，却因为组织成立得太多，问题解决的太少，而造成群众思想上的混乱。如职工尚未明确认识防奸防特与其本身利益的密切关系时，工会工作组不加教育和宣传，就布置成立护厂纠察队，致职工一时都不敢参加。合作社不照顾职工的实际情况，硬规定在发工资时扣合作社股金，以致引起职工的不满，大家不但没有缴股金，而且使生产和学习情绪很受影响。
    该厂工会工作失败的原因是工会工作组人员强迫命令，脱离群众，追求并满足于表面的成绩。有些职工会委员不但不能在生产上起带头作用，而且互相闹宗派、不团结，引起了群众不满。工作组忙于统计数目字、写报告、写通讯、反映表面成绩。在正式公布职工会会员名单那天，职工情绪都不高，破坏分子乘机把表扬积极生产者的标语都撕下了；但该工作组却只忙于向厂方要钱买鞭炮，在会场上凑热闹。该厂工作组在发动群众工作上，一开始就走了弯路，而上级领导未加深察即认为该组不错，指示该组整理发表组织工作的经验；并决定以该厂为成立合作分社重点之一。工会工作负责人员也屡次去讲话，各部门工人运动研究员、新闻记者又相率前往采访，收集材料，并一度在报上表扬。这样，更引起该工作组长的自满，处处从表现成绩着眼。但实际上，该工作组长的工作方法既然是形式主义的和脱离群众的，所以一经深入考察就发现这些所谓成绩都是自欺欺人的。
