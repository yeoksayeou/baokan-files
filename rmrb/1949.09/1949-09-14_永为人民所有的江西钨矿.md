　　Jiangxi Tungsten Mine Forever Owned by the People
    Zhang Haitao
    After the liberation of southern Jiangxi, the tungsten mines in the area have returned to the hands of the Chinese people from the hands of American imperialism and the Kuomintang bandits.

    The last time American imperialism colluded with the Kuomintang bandits to plunder tungsten ore was on the eve of the liberation of southern Jiangxi. They used ten to fifteen planes every day, shuttling between Ganzhou and Kowloon, and looted 950 tons of tungsten ore. But as the People's Liberation Army approached the mining area in southern Jiangxi, the workers in the mining area took action. They dispersed a large amount of gasoline everywhere, deliberately piled up tungsten ore in the mining area without transporting it out, and buried valuable equipment and parts on the cars. The drivers avoided the search by Chiang's bandit army and no longer drove for them. In this way, the world-famous Jiangxi tungsten mine was completely preserved.

    Jiangxi tungsten mines are distributed in sixteen counties, including Dayu, Chongyi, Qiannan, and Nankang. The breadth of the mining area and the richness of the reserves are rare in the world. In the late Qing Dynasty, tungsten mines were first discovered in Xihua Mountain in Dayu, Jiangxi. In the decades since, new discoveries have continued. Now there are nearly one hundred tungsten mines of all sizes in Jiangxi Province. The highest annual output once reached more than 14,000 metric tons, of which the Dayu mining area produced the most. Jiangxi's tungsten ore output accounts for 70% of the country's total output.

    Before 1936, the exploitation and marketing of tungsten mines were privately and dispersedly operated or managed by officials and supervised by merchants. After 1936, the Kuomintang took over the mines for the Nanjing government. Its monopoly organization was initially the Tungsten Industry Administration Office, which was changed to the First Special Mining Area Administration Office in 1945, and then to Jiangxi Tungsten Mining Co., Ltd. in 1948. In the thirteen years that the Kuomintang bandits exchanged tungsten mines for American military supplies, they were very greedy in their plunder of tungsten mines, but they rarely improved the mine equipment. Only four mining areas, including Dajishan, Xihuashan, Litang, and Kuimeishan, have mechanical equipment for power mining and ore dressing. However, as far as the entire Jiangxi tungsten mine is concerned, the proportion is extremely small. The total output of the four mines is less than 1% of the total output of Jiangxi Province. In the thirteen years, the tungsten ore in southern Jiangxi was completely plundered by the Kuomintang bandits, most of which was sold to American imperialism, and in order to show their loyalty to their masters, the selling price of tungsten ore was entirely determined by the New York market. According to statistics, in the thirteen years, the net tungsten ore exploited by private individuals and seized and sold to American imperialists by the Kuomintang government reached 86,513.52 metric tons. Under the joint squeeze of American imperialism and the Chinese bureaucratic comprador group, the selling price of tungsten ore was not even enough to cover the cost, resulting in a serious phenomenon of massive reduction and shrinkage in tungsten ore production in Jiangxi. The output in 1941 was 10,084 metric tons, which dropped to 7,897 metric tons in 1943, and the output from January to July this year was only 1,589 metric tons. Looking at the number of miners, in 1947, there were 3,184 miners in the engineering tunnels and 29,475 miners in the civilian tunnels. In the first half of this year, there were only 200 miners in the engineering tunnels and less than 5,000 miners in the civilian tunnels. Now that the mining area has been liberated, the machine factory in the mining area resumed work on the third day after liberation. The Jiangxi tungsten mine has returned to the hands of the people, and it will play a great role in the industrial construction of the new China.

　　永为人民所有的江西钨矿
    张海涛
    赣南解放后，该区的钨矿已由美帝国主义和国民党匪帮之手回到中国人民的手中。
    美国帝国主义勾结国民党匪帮对钨砂的最后一次劫掠，是在赣南解放前夜。他们每天用十架到十五架飞机，往返赣州和九龙之间，先后抢走了钨砂九百五十吨。但当人民解放军日益迫近赣南矿区的时候，矿区的工人行动起来了。他们把大批汽油四处疏散，把钨砂故意堆在矿区里不运出来，并埋藏了贵重器材和汽车上的零件，司机躲开蒋匪军的搜索，不再为他们开车。就是这样，世界闻名的江西钨矿，得以完整地保存下来。
    江西钨矿遍布大庾、崇义、虔南、南康等十六县。矿区之广，蕴藏之富，为世界所罕有。清朝末年，在江西大庾之西华山初次发现钨矿，数十年来续有发现，现在江西全省大小钨矿，将近一百处。最高年产量曾经达到一万四千余公吨，其中大庾矿区出产最多。江西的钨砂产量占了全国总产量百分之七十。
    一九三六年前，钨矿的开采和运销为私人分散经营或官督商办。一九三六年以后，国民党将矿山收归为南京政府所有，其垄断机构最初为钨业管理处，一九四五年改为第一特种矿区管理处，至一九四八年又改为江西钨矿业有限公司。十三年来国民党匪帮为换取美国军火，对钨矿的掠夺是很贪婪的，但对矿产的设备却很少改进，仅大吉山、西华山、漓塘、岿美山等四矿区有动力采矿、造矿等机械装备，但就江西全省钨矿来说，所占比重极为渺小，合计四矿的产量尚不到赣省总产量的百分之一。十三年来赣南的钨砂全被国民党匪帮所掠夺，其中绝大部分是卖给了美帝国主义，并且为了表示对主子的忠顺，钨砂售价完全取决于纽约市场。统计十三年来，经私人开采而为国民党政府榨取盗卖给美帝国主义者的净钨砂即达八万六千五百十三·五二公吨。在美国帝国主义和中国官僚买办集团联合榨取之下，钨砂的售价还不够成本，造成了江西钨矿大量减产、萎缩的严重现象。一九四一年的产量为一万零八十四公吨，一九四三年下降为七千八百九十七公吨，今年一月至七月的产量则仅达一千五百八十九公吨。从矿工的人数来看，一九四七年工程窿有矿工三千一百八十四人，民窿有矿工二万九千四百七十五人，今年上半年工程窿已仅有矿工二百人，民窿已不足五千人。现在，矿区解放了，矿区的机器厂于解放后的第三天即行复工。江西钨矿回到了人民手中，它将在新中国的工业建设中，发挥其伟大作用。　　　　【新华社南昌十二日电】
