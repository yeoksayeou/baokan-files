Xinhua News Agency Editorial:

　　The People's Liberation Army Shanghai Military Control Commission promulgated two decrees on August 19th to resolve labor-management disputes, providing a correct path for reasonably mediating these disputes. These two decrees should not only be effectively implemented in Shanghai, but their basic principles are also generally applicable to other cities across the country. We believe that in order to bring labor-management relations onto a normal track, to facilitate the restoration and development of production, it is necessary for other regions to promulgate and implement similar decrees.

　　Since liberation, many cities have experienced a large number of labor-management disputes. The emergence of this phenomenon is due, on the one hand, to the fact that some unenlightened capitalists politically oppressed, devastated, and insulted workers during the Kuomintang rule and subjected them to excessive exploitation. After liberation, workers rose up to resist or retaliate, and capitalists felt uneasy and apprehensive, adopting a negative attitude toward production. A few even deliberately delayed the resumption of work, which further aroused the dissatisfaction and opposition of workers. On the other hand, some workers lacked political foresight and were unfamiliar with the economic situation of Chinese society, so they put forward some improper or excessive demands. Many of these demands, in themselves, were not unreasonable, but under the current circumstances of unfinished war and underdeveloped production, they could not be met for the time being. Many Kuomintang special agents and reactionary heads of puppet trade unions often took advantage of the excessively left-leaning sentiments of a few workers, deliberately putting forward some slogans that could not be realized at present, in order to lead workers onto the wrong path, so as to achieve their sinister schemes of sabotaging production and undermining the relationship between workers and the People's Government. For example, some labor-management disputes that occurred in Shanghai, Qingdao, and other places at the beginning of liberation had this background. Furthermore, more seriously, the handling of labor-management disputes in many places was very chaotic, with a state of anarchy. In many large and medium-sized cities, the government did not have a specialized management agency responsible for handling labor-related issues, nor did it stipulate some necessary and feasible unified standards and procedures for resolving labor-management disputes. After labor disputes occurred, some places often allowed district and street governments and lower-level trade unions to make decisions, each acting in its own way. Some places even simply let things go completely, allowing both employees and employers to resolve them directly, resulting in coercion, stalemate, and mutually harmful phenomena. In addition, some places, even though labor bureaus had been established, refused to accept requests for labor dispute arbitration, and instead instructed both parties to negotiate on their own. The solutions negotiated by each industry and each factory varied, influencing each other and increasing unnecessary disputes. This is also one of the reasons for the emergence of left-leaning tendencies in the workers' movement in various places during this period.

　　Generally speaking, in a society where the opposition between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat exists, labor-management disputes are inevitable and promote social progress; but in a people's democratic country, because the working class has already achieved a leading position in state power, and because this state power is already able to guide the operation of capitalists to a certain extent, making them subject to the needs of the state to a certain extent, therefore, labor-management disputes should also adapt to this situation and should not develop unrestrictedly, deviating from the interests of the entire people's country. The phenomenon of unrestricted development of labor-management disputes in some places has already reached the point of hindering the restoration and development of industrial production. This is detrimental to the working class itself, as well as to the country and the people, and effective measures must be taken in a timely manner to address the current problems. The importance of the two decrees of the Shanghai Military Control Commission lies in this.

　　The "Provisional Measures of the Shanghai Military Control Commission Concerning Procedures for the Mediation and Handling of Labor-Management Disputes in Private Enterprises" clearly stipulates: "The Labor Bureau is the organ of this city for mediating and arbitrating labor-management disputes." This contains two important meanings: First, labor disputes are concentrated in organizations at the city level for resolution. This is very necessary. Because such a major and very complex matter as labor-management disputes can only be correctly implemented by concentrating it in organizations at the city level, and a unified step can be sought within the scope of the whole city. Even contracts negotiated by both labor and management themselves must be submitted to the Municipal Labor Bureau for approval and filing before they are valid. In this way, the Municipal Labor Bureau can assess whether the contracts between labor and management are correct and feasible based on the overall social situation of the city, and prevent biases. Second, stipulating that the Municipal Labor Bureau (and not other organs or groups) is the only organ for mediating and arbitrating labor-management disputes can ensure that labor disputes are resolved fairly and reasonably under the leadership of the People's Government, based on the principle of "both labor and management benefit, and production develops," and prevent the chaotic phenomenon of anarchy. In the past and even now, some cities have not established labor bureau organizations, and all labor-management disputes are handled by trade unions, blurring the boundaries between mass organizations and People's Government organizations, which is a big mistake. The trade union is a class-based mass organization of workers, and its task is to resolutely safeguard the interests of workers, and it can only and should only speak for workers. If the workers have excessive or inappropriate demands, estimating that these demands cannot be met at present, or even if they are reluctantly met, they will inevitably lead to greater disadvantages, trade union cadres should persuade and explain to the workers, but this is also from the standpoint of the working class and starting from safeguarding the fundamental interests of the workers. Trade union cadres should faithfully represent the workers and negotiate with the capitalists after reaching a consensus with the workers on labor-management dispute issues, and should never stand in an intermediate position between labor and management for mediation, or replace the position of the government for mandatory arbitration. If that is done, it will blur the workers' understanding of the trade union as a class-based mass organization, alienate the trade union from its own workers, and even if the handling opinion is correct, it is often not easy to convince the capitalists sincerely. The Labor Bureau is a political power organ, a working department of the People's Government, and the People's Democratic Government is led by the working class and participated by the bourgeoisie. It can more carefully consider and take care of the opinions and interests of both labor and management, and has the power to make effective decisions. Therefore, places that have not yet established a labor bureau should quickly establish it in order to uniformly handle labor-management disputes, adjust labor-management relations, and promote the restoration and development of production.

　　Secondly, the aforementioned provisional measures make specific provisions for the steps to resolve labor-management disputes. The steps are: First, if a labor-management dispute occurs, both labor and management should first negotiate directly to resolve it. Second, if negotiation fails, either party may apply to the Labor Bureau for mediation; if mediation fails, arbitration may be applied for in accordance with the law. Third, if either party disagrees with the arbitration, it may file a lawsuit with the court in accordance with the law, and the court shall make a judgment, with the court judgment as the final procedure. Such provisions have two advantages: On the one hand, under the leadership of the People's Government, the spirit and method of democracy are implemented to ensure that both labor and management are in an equal position of mutual equality. In the overall process of mediating disputes, both parties have ample opportunity to appeal for their own demands, difficulties, and opinions, and conduct consultations calmly, so that labor-management disputes can be easily resolved fairly and reasonably. On the other hand, also under the leadership of the People's Government, through three democratic steps, it is guaranteed that labor-management disputes that have occurred are quickly resolved, and production is maintained as usual during the resolution process, preventing the impact on production, business, and workers' lives due to prolonged delays. The provisional measures specifically stipulate: "After a dispute occurs between labor and management, before the negotiation, mediation, and arbitration are established, both parties should maintain the status quo of production. The employer shall not have the disposition of closing the factory, stopping wages, stopping meals, or other reductions in treatment, and the labor party shall not have any actions of slowdown or other hindrance to production or destruction of labor discipline. However, even if one party needs to request the court to handle the matter after the arbitration of the Labor Bureau is determined, both parties shall abide by the decision of the arbitration before the court makes a judgment." This provision is very necessary and reasonable. In short, for the benefit of the country and the people, we must resolve all labor-management disputes under leadership, in an organized manner, and as quickly as possible, based on the principle of "both labor and management benefit, and production develops."

　　Thirdly, the aforementioned provisional measures stipulate that the resolution of labor-management disputes should adopt the method of concluding collective contracts. That is: "Daily disputes within the scope of one factory may be negotiated by labor and management representatives on a factory basis; disputes of the same nature within the scope of the same industry or trade should be resolved by legal organizations organized by labor and management separately convening meetings and electing an equal number of representatives for consultation." The method of labor and management concluding collective contracts here has begun to be implemented in some large cities such as Beiping, Tianjin, and Shanghai, and it has proved to be beneficial and harmless. Adopting this method can correct the past defects in some places of dispersing, handling and solving individual labor-management dispute events separately, resulting in inconsistent spirit and different methods, which affect each other and cause more and more disputes as they are resolved. After the collective contract is concluded, at least for a considerable period of time, it can ease labor-management relations, stabilize production sentiment, and ensure the orderly progress of production. At the same time, adopting this method also makes it easy to organize workers in various industries and trades into trade unions, strengthen collectivist education, improve the unity and consciousness of the working class, and break the guild concepts and lax state of some handicraft workers.

　　Fourthly, the "Provisional Measures of the Shanghai Municipal Military Control Commission on Handling Disputes over Resumption of Work and Business" makes correct provisions for the employment relationship between labor and management. According to the measures, the employer shall not delay the resumption of work and business without reason. When factories and shops that have been suspended resume work and business, they shall give priority to employing the original employees. The employer shall not dismiss employees on the pretext of suspicion or because employees participate in trade unions and other political activities, which gives employees a considerable guarantee of their profession. On the other hand, it is also stipulated that the employer has the right to hire and dismiss employees for the needs of production or work. If it is indeed impossible to start work and resume business due to insurmountable difficulties, the business may be closed or transferred with the approval of the competent municipal government, which takes care of the employer's difficulties and gives them sufficient freedom of business operation. By adopting this method, many disputes concerning the resumption of work and business and employment and dismissal can be easily resolved.

　　After liberating many large and medium-sized cities, we have explored some mature experiences through the handling of various labor-management dispute events. Now, these correct experiences should be quickly promoted to resolve the labor-management disputes that currently exist and may occur in the future, ensure the normal progress of production, and further promote the development and expansion of production.

### 解决劳资争议的正确途径

　　解决劳资争议的正确途径
    人民解放军上海市军事管制委员会于八月十九日颁布了两个解决劳资争议的法令，对于合理地调处劳资争议提供了正确的途径。这两个法令不仅应在上海有效地实施，而且其基本原则一般地也适用于全国其他城市。我们认为，为了把劳资关系引入正常的轨道，以利恢复和发展生产，其他地方也有颁布和实施类似的法令的必要。
    许多城市在解放以后，劳资争议繁多。这种现象的产生，一方面是由于某些不开明的资本家在国民党统治时期曾经在政治上压迫、摧残和侮辱工人，并对工人进行过重的剥削，在解放以后，工人起而反抗或报复，资本家则心存不安和顾虑，对生产抱着消极态度，其中少数人甚至故意拖延复工，以致更加引起工人的不满和反对。另一方面，也有一部分工人由于政治上缺乏远见，对中国社会的经济情况不了解，所以提出某些不正当的或过高的要求，其中也有许多要求，就其本身来说是无可非议的，但在目前战争未结束和生产不发达的情形下，一时却还办不到。而许多国民党特务分子和伪工会反动头子，则往往利用少数工人的过左情绪，故意提出一些现在不能实现的口号，来引导工人走到错误的路上去，以达其破坏生产和破坏工人与人民政府关系的诡计。例如上海、青岛等地在刚解放的时候发生的某些劳资争执事件，便曾有这种背景。此外，更严重的是许多地方对于劳资争议的处理十分混乱，存在着一种无政府状态。许多大中城市，政府方面并无专门负责处理劳资问题的管理机关，也没有规定解决劳资争议的某些必要而又可行的统一标准和手续。在劳资纠纷发生以后，有些地方往往由区街政府和下级工会作主解决，各行其是，人自为政。也有些地方党和政府率性完全放任不管，听由职工和业主双方直接解决，以至发生了胁迫、僵持、两败俱伤等不良现象。此外，有些地方甚至劳动局虽已成立，也不受理劳资争议仲裁的请求，而以责令双方自行协商了事，各行各业各厂自行协商的解决办法不一，相互影响，也增加了不必要的纠纷。这也是这一时期各地工人运动发生左的倾向的原因之一。
    一般地说，在资产阶级和无产阶级的对立存在着的社会中，劳资争议是不可避免的，是促进社会进步的；但是在人民民主国家中，由于工人阶级已经取得了对于国家政权的领导地位，由于这种国家政权已经有可能对于资本家的经营进行一定的指导，使其在一定程度上服从于国家的需要，因此，劳资的争议也就应当适应这种情况，不要脱离整个人民国家的利益而无限制地发展。现在有些地方的劳资争议无限制发展的现象，已经达到了妨碍恢复和发展工业生产的地步。对于工人阶级自己，对于国家和人民都是不利的，必须针对当前症结所在，及时采取有效办法予以解决。上海军管会的两个法令的重要性，正在于此。
    上海军管会“关于私营企业劳资争议调处程序暂行办法”明确地规定：“劳动局为本市调解和仲裁劳资争议的机关”。这里包含两方面的重要意义：一、把劳资纠纷集中到市一级的组织来解决。这是十分必要的。因为象劳资争议这样关系重大而又十分复杂的事，只有集中到市一级的组织来处理，才能正确地贯彻人民政府的政策，并求得在全市范围内有统一的步骤。就是劳资双方自行协议的契约，也必须呈请市劳动局批准备案，方为有效。这样，市劳动局就可以根据全市全般社会情况，来估量劳资双方契约是否正确可行，防止发生偏向。二、规定以市劳动局（而不是其他机关或团体）为调解和仲裁劳资争议的唯一机关，这就可使劳资纠纷，在人民政府领导下，依据“劳资两利、发展生产”的原则，得到公平合理的解决，防止无政府的混乱现象。过去乃至现在，有些城市没有建立劳动局的组织，一切劳资纠纷都由工会出面处理，使群众团体和人民政府组织的界限不分，这是很大的错误。工会是工人的阶级性的群众组织，它的任务是坚决地维护工人利益，只能够也只应当代表工人说话。如果工人群众有过高的不适当的要求，估计这种要求目前无法达到，或者即使勉强做到而势必招致更大不利，工会工作干部便应向工人进行说服解释，但这也是站在工人阶级立场并从维护工人的根本利益出发。工会干部对于劳资争议问题，在与工人群众商得一致意见后，便应忠实地代表工人，向资方进行交涉，而决不应站在劳资之间的中间立场进行调解，或者是代替政府的地位，进行带有强制性的仲裁。如果那样做法，就会模糊工人对于工会这个阶级性群众组织的认识，使工会脱离自己的工人群众，并且即令处理的意见是正确的，也往往不容易使资方心悦诚服。劳动局则是政权机关，是人民政府的一个工作部门，而人民民主政府是由工人阶级领导而又有资产阶级参加的，它可以更周到地考虑和照顾劳资双方的意见和利益，并有权力作有效的决定。因此，凡是尚未建立劳动局的地方应该迅速地把劳动局设立起来，以便统一处理劳资争议，调整劳资关系，推动生产的恢复和发展。
    其次，同上暂行办法对于解决劳资争议的步骤作了具体规定。这个步骤便是：一、劳资发生争议，首由劳资双方直接协商解决。二、协商无效，任何一方得申请劳动局调解；调解不成功，得依法仲裁。三、任何一方对仲裁不服，得向法院依法起诉，由法院判决，以法院判决为最后程序。这样的规定有两方面的好处，就是：一方面，在人民政府的领导下，贯彻民主精神和民主方式，保证劳资双方处于相互平等的对等地位，在调处争议的全般过程中，任何一方都有充分地申诉自己的要求、困难和意见的机会，平心静气地进行磋商，使劳资争议便于得到公平合理的解决。另一方面，同样是在人民政府领导下，通过三个民主的步骤，保证已发生的劳资争议迅速地获得解决，而且在解决过程中照常维持生产，防止由于长期拖延不决，而影响生产营业和工人生活。在该暂行办法中特别规定：“劳资双方发生争议后，在协商、调解、仲裁未成立前，双方均应维持生产原状，资方不得有停厂、停资、停伙及其他减低待遇之处置，劳方不得有怠工或其他妨害生产或破坏劳动纪律之举动。但经劳动局仲裁确定后，即使有一方须提请法院处理，在法院未判决时，双方均应遵照仲裁之决定办理。”这个规定是十分必要和合理的。总之，为了国家和人民的利益，我们必须有领导地、有组织地、并尽可能迅速地根据“劳资两利、发展生产”的原则来解决一切劳资争议。
    再次，同上暂行办法规定，劳资争议的解决，应该采取订立集体合同的办法。即：“属于一厂范围之日常纠纷，得以厂为单位由劳资双方互派代表进行协商；其争议性质属于同一产业或行业范围者，应以产业或行业为单位，由劳资双方所组织之合法团体分别召集会议，推选同等数量之代表协商解决之。”这里劳资双方订立集体合同的办法，在北平、天津、上海等若干大城市已在开始实行，证明是有利无害的。采取这个办法，可以纠正过去某些地方对各个个别的劳资争议事件分散处理，单独解决，因而精神不一，办法互异，以致互相影响，越解决而纠纷越多的弊病。集体合同订立后，至少可在相当时期内，使劳资关系缓和，生产情绪稳定，保证生产的有秩序地进行。同时，采取这个办法，又可便于把各行各业的工人组织到工会中来，加强集体主义的教育，提高工人阶级的团结和觉悟，并打破某些手工业工人的行帮观念和散漫状态。
    第四、上海市军管会“关于复业复工纠纷处理暂行办法”，对于劳资之间的雇用关系作了正确的规定。按照该办法，资方不得借故拖延复业复工，已停业的工厂商店复工复业时应尽先录用原来的职工，资方不得挟嫌或因职工参加工会及其他政治活动而借故解雇职工，这就使职工的职业获得了相当的保证。但另一方面，又规定资方为了生产或工作的需要有雇用与解雇职工之权利，如确因不可克服的困难而不能开工复业者，经市府主管机关批准，可以歇业或转业，这就照顾了资方的困难，并使其业务的经营得到了足够的自由权利。采取这个办法，许多关于复工复业和雇用解雇问题的纠纷，便可迎刃而解。
    在解放了许多大中城市以后，经过对于各种劳资纠纷事件的处理，我们已经摸索出了若干成熟的经验。现在，应该把这些正确的经验迅速推广，以解决目前存在着的和今后可能发生的劳资争议，保证生产的正常进行，并进而推动发展和扩大生产。
