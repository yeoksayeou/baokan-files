Burlap Bag of Sorghum
　　My name is Zhang Guirong, from Shuangmiao, Linqing. I’m thirty-two this year! My family has been poor for three generations. My grandfather worked as a long-term laborer, and was crushed to death under a landlord's cart. My parents raised me and my three sisters, farming a dozen or so acres of barren land, constantly suffering from hunger and cold, eating chaff and wild herbs. Once, my father ate too much and couldn't defecate. My mother used an iron key to try to dig it out for him. My father couldn't help but bitterly scold, "Raising so many stinking daughters, all losers, it's better to send two of them away early." My mother cried when she heard this, but couldn't bear to part with any of us. My father was also very fond of his daughters, and tears fell after he said that – those were the words of a hungry man!
　　I was only twelve years old then, but I was already sensible! I saw that my mother hadn’t been able to eat or drink for several days, and was always frowning; my father puffed on his dry tobacco pipe, coughing and sighing. I guessed that something bad was coming! One day, I dug up a basket of alfalfa from the east of the village. Just as I entered the door, my mother pulled me into her arms and cried, and my father stomped his feet and cursed, "Crying, what good does it do? Can she stay with us forever? Sooner or later, she'll belong to someone else!" A dark-faced old woman was sitting beside her, her eyes flashing as she stared at me, and she comforted my mother, "Her Second Sister-in-law, it's too late to regret it now, we've arranged it with the other family, and besides, this is a burlap bag of sorghum!" My mother wiped her tears, pushed me away, and ran into the house. The old woman pulled me up to leave, but I hugged the big locust tree in the yard, refusing to let go. My father picked up a sorghum stalk broom and was about to hit me. And that's how, crying, I left my parents with that dark-faced old woman.
　　The life of a child bride is more bitter than eating Coptis chinensis! My mother-in-law was a nagging woman, and took out her anger on me. She often said to me, "The wife you marry is like the horse you buy, you can ride her and beat her." My husband was a man in his forties, as tall as a jujube pole, with a face full of pockmarks like a celestial tablet. I was scared when I saw him, but he was actually quite kind to me, and when my mother-in-law beat me, he would stop her, saying, "What good does it do to beat her when she's so young!" My mother-in-law wouldn't listen, and cursed, "You protective idiot, raising you for so long and you don't understand your mother's suffering. If she can't spin thread, what are you going to use to buy rice?" My heart was full of grievances, but I had nowhere to pour them out!
　　Every day, I lived like a wheel, my hands and feet constantly turning. My husband sold pancakes. Before dawn, I would get up to push the millstone, and after putting down the millstone, I would watch the pot. After baking the pancakes, I would have to cook, feed the pigs, and gather firewood before the sun was high. At night, I had to spin thread until the three stars were in the south before I could sleep. I was so tired after a day's work, but I was sleepy. One day, I fell asleep in the arms of the spinning wheel. When I woke up, it was already faintly light. After eating breakfast, the landlord Qinghe came to force my mother-in-law to pay for the rice. The thread hadn't been sold yet. My mother-in-law asked me for the yarn, and when she saw that it hadn't been spun, she added fuel to the fire, grabbed my braids, and gave me a sound beating, leaving my face black and blue.

    Famine Relief
　　That year, there was a plague, and many people died in the villages. My mother-in-law was fine the day before, but in the middle of the night, she vomited and had diarrhea. The doctor couldn't be brought home before she died! From then on, my husband and I moved in with my mother. Who knew that the next year would be a bad one. It rained non-stop for seven days, and the green crops were flooded one after another. Several counties had no harvest, and no grain was to be seen. Rice was too expensive to buy, and the pancake griddle was also out of fire. Seeing that several people were staring blankly, my father and husband went to the north of the province to find work. A few days later, even the accumulated dried vegetable leaves were eaten. There was no other way, so my mother, my sister, and I went to Henan to beg for food. At that time, my mother was five months pregnant and couldn't walk well. The mud on the road sank to our knees, and we were hungry, so we stumbled every few steps. We got up and walked again. My mother and sisters gritted our teeth and finally reached Kaifeng. We went to people's doors to beg for food. My sister was too young to dare to beg, but I boldly went to someone's door and just shouted, "Auntie! Give us something to eat!" I heard a few barks, and a big yellow dog rushed out of the door. I couldn't dodge in time, and it bit a big hole in me. Look, this big scar on my leg...
　　We ran south and north, begging for food for three months. Seeing that my mother was about to give birth, what could we do? My mother was so worried that she cried. Thinking that being outside wasn't a permanent solution, my mother and sisters went home.
　　When we got home, the house had been washed away by the water! Only a pile of mud remained. There was no way, so my mother and sisters lived in the temple. Later, my father and husband also came back, empty-handed, and brought nothing back. My father said angrily, "There's really no way for poor people to survive in this world. There are wolves that eat people everywhere, and they worked for nothing." My husband frowned and didn't say a word. The family cried a lot, but crying couldn't fill their stomachs! My mother persuaded my father to borrow grain from Zhang Qinghe. Seeing that we had no land and no house, not only did he not lend us any, but he pointed at my father's nose and scolded, "Lending to you is like feeding meat dumplings to a dog, it's gone forever." In the end, we asked Uncle Er from the front yard to be our guarantor. After saying three thousand six good words, he lent us two dou of fermented sorghum, stipulating that we would pay it back the following year, borrowing two dou and returning four dou. Those two dou of sorghum would become four dou by the wheat harvest. What would we use to pay it back? The donkey rolled more and more, and by autumn, Zhang Qinghe was afraid of being cheated, so he had people tear down our few houses, and pulled away the doors and windows; it wasn't enough, so he asked us to work for him instead, stating: four people would work for his family for a year. From then on, my father and husband worked for him, my mother cooked for him, I looked after his young mistress's child, and my two younger sisters found masters and were taken away.
　　In the winter, Zhang Qinghe's young mistress wore a lambskin coat and stayed by the stove without going out. I wore a tattered cotton coat that hadn't been taken apart for three years, and the wind blew straight in, freezing my teeth. Her child was so spoiled that she was "afraid of breaking if you held her in your hand, and afraid of melting if you held her in your mouth." As long as she cried, I would be beaten and scolded.
　　That wasn't all. Once, the mule broke its reins, and the young mistress insisted that I go and lead it. I trembled and just leaned forward when "thump" I was kicked right in the face, and blood flowed from my face to the ground. The next day, my face was swollen like a "judge." The landlord wouldn't treat me, and we couldn't afford a doctor. Look, these three scars on my face are bigger than a mule's hoof.

    Passed Through the Door
　　Zhang Qinghe was even more vicious than his young mistress. On the surface, he seemed very smooth, but his stomach was full of dog tricks. Usually, when the young mistress wasn't at home, his two thieving eyes would roll and roll and smile at me. I often suspected something and was wary of him; who knew that one day, the young mistress went back to her parents' home, and insisted that my mother go with her. At night, Zhang Qinghe asked me to light his opium lamp. At first, he hummed and hawed, pretending to be quite honest, and smoked until midnight. He had had his fill, got up, stretched, and then latched the door, turned around, and grabbed me. Just as I wanted to shout, my mouth was covered by his hand. That's how he pushed me down on the bed. From then on, like a seed falling into the ground, a disease fell into my heart.
　　When my mother came back and heard this, she was shocked and trembled all over. Afraid that something would happen to me, she discussed it with my husband and asked me to pass through the door earlier. On the second day of the eighth month, my mother borrowed a red cotton coat from Aunt Erda and braided my hair. My husband also changed into a new cotton robe and tied a new belt around his waist. His sad face looked like it had been unlocked. Lying in the horse shed, he said, "Poor is poor, but this time we've finally made it together!" I didn't dare to look at him, my heart was pounding with joy, and tears flowed all over his chest!
　　In the autumn of the following year, I was about to give birth, and the young mistress was afraid of affecting her family's feng shui, so she kicked me out to the temple. I gave birth to a little girl, but we had nothing. It just so happened that my husband wasn't home that day, and my mother was helping out at the young mistress's parents' home, so I was alone. When the child was born, I was scared to death, and I didn't even have scissors. What could I do? I hardened my heart and bit off the child's umbilical cord with my teeth and tied it with a hemp rope. When the landlord's wife had her confinement, she drank ginger soup and ate noodles; when I gave birth, I couldn't even touch a drop of rice soup. After the child was born, my stomach felt empty like a pit. I licked a handful of wheat bran and drank two bowls of cold water, and from then on, I was left with a root of illness. Look at how many teeth I'm missing in my mouth!
　　The day after giving birth, I went out to beg for food! I shouted from door to door to aunts and older women, but I still couldn't get enough to eat. There was no way, so I nursed the landlord's child. My own child was skin and bones from hunger, her face like a small yellow pear, crying all day long. I looked at the child, wiped away my tears, and had to feed the landlord's child. That's how I starved my own child to death!

  　布袋高粱
    俺叫张桂荣，临清双庙人，今年三十二啦！三辈子受穷，爷爷给人家扛长活，轧死在地主的大车底下；爹和娘拉着俺姊妹四个，种着十来亩兔子不拉屎的地，成天价挨饿受冻，吃糠咽菜。一次，爹吃多了，拉不下屎来，娘用铁钥匙给他往外掏，爹禁不住伤心的骂着：“养活这么多臭闺女，都是赔钱货，不如趁早送出去两个。”娘一听就哭，可是舍不得一个，爹原也是很疼自己闺女，说后直掉眼泪，那是饿饥了的话啊！
    那年俺才十二岁，可就懂事啦！见娘有几天饭也吃不下，水也喝不下，总是愁眉不展；爹巴达着他那旱烟袋，也咳声叹气，我猜着坏事快来啦！一天，俺从村东掏了一篮子苜蓿，刚进门，娘一把把我拉到她怀里，抱着俺就哭起来，爹跺着脚骂：“哭，当了个球，她能跟咱一辈子？早晚还不是人家的！”旁边坐着一个黑脸老婆子，她两眼一闪一闪地直瞅我，还劝俺娘：“她二嫂，后悔可也晚了，咱是给人家定下的，再说这是一布袋高粱啊！”娘擦擦眼泪，推开我就往屋里跑。老婆子拉起我就要走，我抱着院子里那棵大槐树，死不放手，爹拿起笤帚圪塔就要打，这样，俺跟着那个黑脸老婆子，就哭哭啼啼的离开了爹娘。
    童养媳的生活，比吃黄莲还苦啊！婆婆是个爱叨唠的人，有了气就往俺身上出，常向俺说：“娶到的媳妇买到的马，就得由俺骑来由俺打。”男人是个四十多岁的人，个子高的象个打枣杆，一脸麻子象块天牌。俺一看就害怕，可是他心眼对俺倒挺好，婆婆一打，他就拦挡着说：“年轻轻地打她顶个啥！”婆婆可不依，就骂：“你个护婆精，白养活你这么大可不懂娘的苦，纺不出线子，＠米你用啥？”俺满肚子冤屈，可没处倒啊！
    俺每天活象个车轮子，手脚不停地一个劲转，男人卖煎饼，天不明就起来推磨，放下磨棍就看熬子，烙完饼太阳一杆子高就要做饭，喂猪，拾柴禾；到黑间，纺线要纺到三星正南才能睡。忙活一天可是困啊，有一天，俺倒在纺花车怀里就睡着了，一觉醒来，天已经朦朦亮，吃过早饭，地主庆和来逼着婆婆要米钱，线子还没卖出去，婆婆向我要穗子，见没纺出来，火上加油，揪住俺的小辫子就是一顿饱打，打的脸上青一块，紫一块。
    渡荒
    那年闹瘟疫，各村死了不少的人，婆婆头天还好着，半夜里连吐带泻，先生没请到家就死啦！从那，俺就和娘搬到一圪堆住。谁知，第二年又赶上个孬年景，接连不停的下了七天雨，青青的庄稼淹的一片连一片，好几县寸草不收，粒粮不见。米贵的买不起，煎饼锅子也停了火。眼看几口人干瞪着眼，爹就和男人下北乡找活去了。几天后，积下干菜叶子也吃光了。没法，俺和妹妹就跟娘下河南去要饭。那时娘肚里怀着五个月的胎，走也走不动，道上的泥陷到膝盖，肚子又饥，走几步一个跟头，爬起来又走，俺娘们几个咬着牙，才到了开封。到人家大门口去要饭，妹妹小不敢要，俺大着胆子到一家门口，刚喊了一声：“大娘！给点啥吃吧！”只听汪汪几声，随着就从门里窜出一条大黄狗，俺躲也来不及，一口给咬了个大窟窿。你看，我腿上这个大疤拉……。
    南跑北颠地讨了三个月饭，眼看娘就要生孩子，这可怎么办呢？愁的娘直哭，想想光在外边，也不是个常事，娘们几个就回了家。
    到家，房子都叫水冲啦！只剩下一堆烂泥，没法子，俺娘们几个就住了庙。后来，爹和男人也回来了，两手攒空拳，啥也没带回来，爹气呼呼地说：“这个世道真没穷人活的路，到那里也有吃人的狼，白给人家干了一阵子。”男人紧皱着眉头一声也不啃，几口子抱着头哭了一顿，哭也哭不饱啊！娘劝爹往张庆和家借粮食，人家看着咱地无一垄，房无一间，不但不借，还指着爹的鼻子骂道：“借给你们就是肉饱子打狗，一去不回头。”最后还是托了前院二叔当保人，好话说了三千六，才借给二斗沤高粱，说定第二年还清，借二斗还四斗。这二斗高粱啊，到麦里可就变成了四斗，用啥还呢？驴打滚越打越多，拖到秋里，张庆和怕坑了他，叫人把俺那几间房拆了个乱七八糟，连门带窗都拉走了；还不够，人家就叫俺用人顶，言明：四口人给他家做一年活。从那爹和男人给人家扛活，娘给人家做饭，俺给他小婆看孩子，两个妹妹找了个主，也叫人家领走了。
    冬里，张庆和的小婆，穿羊羔子皮袄，围着火炉子不出门，俺穿的是三年没拆过的破棉袄，风直个往里钻，冻的俺直嗑打牙。她那孩子娇得真是“攒在手里怕碎了，含在嘴里怕化了”，只要哭一声，俺就要挨打骂。
    这还不算，一回骡子开了缰绳，小婆子非叫俺去牵，俺哆哆嗦嗦刚往前一凑“嗵”就是一踢子，正踢到俺脸上，血从脸上流到地下。第二天，脸肿的象“判官”，地主不给治，咱又请不起先生，你看，俺脸上这三块疤拉比骡蹄子都大。
    过了门
    张庆和比他小婆还毒辣，表面上看去很圆滑，肚子里都满是狗心眼。平常那小婆一不在家他那两个贼眼，就一翻一翻的向我笑。俺常犯嘀蛄（心疑），提心吊胆防着他；谁知那一天小婆回娘家，非叫娘跟她一道去。夜里，张庆和叫俺给他烧烟灯，起初他哼哼哈哈装得怪老实，一直抽到半夜，他过足了瘾，起来伸伸懒腰随着就把门闩上，又一回身就拉住了俺，我刚想喊，嘴已经一手被他捂住，就这样把俺按倒床上，从那，就象一颗种落在地里，俺心里便落下了一块病。
    娘回来一听，凉水浇头气的混身抖。怕俺出了岔子，就和俺男人商量着叫俺早些过门。八月初二那一天，娘从二大娘家借了件红棉袄，给俺把辫子挽起来；俺男人也换了件新棉袍，腰里还束了条新腰带。男人愁眉苦眼的脸象开了锁，躺在马棚子里，他说：“穷就穷过，这回可算熬到一堆了！”俺不敢看他，心里喜也扑腾，泪珠儿流了他一胸脯！
    第二年秋里，俺快要生孩子，小婆怕冲了她家风水，把俺撵到庙里，添了个小妮，可要啥没啥，偏偏那天俺男人不在家，娘在小婆的娘家帮忙，就只俺一个人，孩子生下来，俺慌的要死，连把剪子也没有，可怎么呢？俺狠狠心用牙把孩子的脐带咬下来，用根麻绳扎住。地主家的媳妇做月子，喝姜汤，吃面叶；俺生孩子可连一口米汤也摸不着。孩子落地后，肚里觉得空的象个坑，舐了一把糠面，喝了两碗凉水，从那可就落下了个病根，你看我嘴里的牙缺了多少个！
    生孩子后的第二天，俺就出去要饭啦！婶子大娘的遥街喊也要不饱。没办法，就给地主家奶孩子，自家的孩子饿的皮包骨头，脸象个小黄梨，成天价哭，俺看看孩子擦擦泪，还得把奶喂给地主的，就这样，硬把个孩子饿死啦！
