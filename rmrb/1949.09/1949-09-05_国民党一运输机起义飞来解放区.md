　　Xinhua News Agency dispatch: On August 25th, Li Fuyu, co-pilot of the Kuomintang Central Aviation Transport Corporation, flew a C-47 type No. 501 transport plane from Baiyun Airport in Guangzhou and defected to the liberated area. The plane landed safely at an airport in a certain liberated area that day, and was warmly welcomed by the local military and civilians. Li Fuyu is a native of Taishan, Guangdong, and is thirty-three years old. This time, in view of the fact that the remaining Kuomintang bandit gangs are about to be completely wiped out by the People's Liberation Army, and unwilling to perish with them, he resolutely piloted the plane to revolt and came over to the people's side to serve the people's aviation cause. Mr. Li expressed the hope that the remaining Kuomintang air force personnel would wake up and defect to the People's Liberation Army, so as to avoid becoming victims of American imperialism and its running dog, the Kuomintang bandit gang.

　　国民党一运输机起义飞来解放区
    【本报讯】新华社电：国民党中央航空公司副飞行员李福遇八月二十五日驾驶Ｃ四七型五○一号运输机一架，由广州白云机场起飞，投奔解放区，当日在解放区某地机场安全降落，受到当地军民的热烈欢迎。李福遇为广东台山人，年三十三岁。此次因鉴于国民党残余匪帮即将为人民解放军彻底肃清，不愿随同覆灭，乃毅然驾机起义，投到人民方面来，为人民航空事业服务。李氏表示希望残余国民党空军人员能幡然觉悟，投奔人民解放军，以免做美帝国主义及其走狗国民党匪帮的牺牲品。
