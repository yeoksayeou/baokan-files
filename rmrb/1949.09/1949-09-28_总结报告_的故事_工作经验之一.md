　　The Story of "Summary Reports" - One of My Work Experiences
    Yī Qīn
    I never had a plan when I was studying at school, but after I started working, I had to do a "Weekly Summary Report of Cultural and Educational Work." In a week, I did some things, but when I thought about it, it seemed too trivial and difficult to connect. So, my first summary report in my life appeared in this form: "Culture class is divided into three groups, with three classes this week. More than 20 blackboard newspaper articles, mostly praises. The literary and art activities learned one song. One evening party was held." I really couldn't think of anything else to write.
    The instructor talked to me and said: "Your summary is too simple. After the leaders read it, they still don't understand the situation. What does your summary explain? Even the numbers are not accurate. More than 20 articles, mostly praises, how many exactly are twenty-some? What does 'mostly' mean? What about the rest? I don't understand. Take the culture class, for example: how are you dividing the groups? What is the basis for the division? What is the feedback from the comrades on the classes? Is the teaching material and teaching method appropriate? Does it arouse the interest of the comrades? Which comrades are the most active in learning, and which are the least active? You didn't mention any of these. What role did the blackboard newspaper play? Did it really cooperate with the progress of the company's central work in each period? Do people like to read it? What good materials and good examples can be introduced to the whole battalion and regiment? Which comrades are the most active in contributing? How was the entertainment evening organized? You didn't mention any of these. What's the use of just telling me the numbers—even the numbers that are not very accurate?"
    My face turned red, and every word pierced my heart. The instructor continued:
    "Of course, you just came out of school and have never done this kind of work before, so it's no wonder. The main purpose of the summary is to summarize experience and insights, improve yourself through work, and discover and solve problems through work. Do you keep a work diary? No, right? You can order a small notebook, you don't have to write every day, writing every two days is also fine. Take some time at night to write down the work in a concise manner, and try to discover problems. In addition, what you plan to do tomorrow can also be planned tonight and written down. Then, compare it tomorrow night to see what has been done and what has not been done. In this way, when you do the summary, the materials are all on it, very rich, just organize it."
    This made me realize that my past work was not serious and conscientious, and that doing it casually would not only make the work not well done, but also make it impossible to improve myself.

　　“总结报告”的故事　工作经验之一
    依钦
    在学校里念书一向就没有个计划，参加了工作却要做“每周文教工作总结汇报”。一个星期，多少干了一些事情，可是回想起来就显得太琐碎，很难联系起来。于是，有生以来的第一个总结报告就以如此姿态出现了：“文化课分三组上课，一周来共上课三次。黑板报稿子二十余篇，多半是表扬。文娱活动学会歌子一个。晚会举行一次。”此外实在也再想不出有什么可写。
    教导员找我去谈话了，说：“你的总结太简单了，领导上看过后还是不了解是怎样的情况。你的总结说明了些什么呢？连数目字都不确实，二十余篇，多半是表扬，究竟是二十几呢？多半又是多少呢？其余的呢？不明白。就拿上文化课来说吧：你分组是怎样一个分法？根据什么来分？上的课同志们有什么反映？教材内容和教授法是否合宜，能引起同志们的兴趣？那些同志学习最积极，那些最不积极？这些你都没有提及。黑板报起到了那些作用？是否真正做到了配合连队每期中心工作的进展？大伙是不是爱看？有些什么好材料，好典型可以介绍给全营、全团的？那些同志投稿最积极？文娱晚会是怎样组织的？这些你都没有提到，光把数目字—甚至还是不怎么确实的数目字——告诉我有什么用呢？”
    我脸红了，句句话直往心坎里钻。教导员继续地说：
    “当然，你刚从学校出来，没有担任过这类工作，这也难怪。总结主要是总结经验、心得，从工作中提高自己，从工作中发现问题，解决问题。你做工作日记没有？没有吧？你回去可以订一个小本子，不一定每天要记，两天一记也行，晚上抽点时间，扼要地把工作写下来，尽量发现问题。此外明天预定要做些什么，也可今晚计划好，写下来，到明晚再来个对照，看那些做了？那些还没有做，这样，做总结的时候，材料都在这上面，丰富得很，组织一下就行。”
    这才使我恍然于过去工作的不严肃、认真，随随便便的搞，不仅工作搞不好，并且也决不可能提高自己。
