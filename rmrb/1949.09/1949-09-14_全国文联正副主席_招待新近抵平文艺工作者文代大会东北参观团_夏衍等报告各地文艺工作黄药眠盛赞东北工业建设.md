　　The Chairman and Vice Chairmen of the National Federation of Literary and Art Circles
　  Host Reception for Newly Arrived Literary and Art Workers and Northeast Visiting Group of the Literary and Art Congress
    Xia Yan and Others Report on Literary and Art Work in Various Regions; Huang Yaomian Highly Praises Northeast Industrial Construction
    [Our Newspaper] Guo Moruo, Mao Dun, and Zhou Yang, Chairman and Vice Chairmen of the National Federation of Literary and Art Circles, hosted a reception at Laijinyuxuan in Zhongshan Park at 2:00 PM on the 13th for newly arrived literary and art workers from various regions and the Northeast visiting group of the Literary and Art Congress, which had recently returned to Beijing. Over sixty people attended, including Xia Yan, Shao Quanlin, Huang Mo, Liu Baiyu, Ren Baige, Mei Lanfang, Zhou Xinfang, Yuan Xuefen, Feng Xuefeng, and Ba Jin. At the meeting, Xia Yan, Shao Quanlin, Huang Mo, and Liu Baiyu reported on the literary and art work situation in Shanghai, Hong Kong, Wuhan, and the military, respectively. Huang Yaomian, the head of the Northeast visiting group, reported on his impressions after returning from the Northeast.
    Xia Yan pointed out in his report that Shanghai's literary and art work had achieved success after liberation, and one of the important reasons was that Shanghai had a long tradition and foundation of progressive literary and art activities. As soon as Shanghai was liberated, the Film and Drama Association organized over thirty propaganda teams to conduct propaganda in the streets and factories. After the Literary and Art Congress, the unity of Shanghai's literary and art circles has been further strengthened, and both new and old artists can cooperate well. Currently, what is needed is to expand the target of literary and art work from organized masses to the general public, and to carry out ideological education to the broad masses through various forms. At the same time, there is a demand for a large number of works reflecting the lives of the people of Jiangnan.
    Shao Quanlin reported that in Hong Kong, imperialists are intensifying their oppression of progressive culture, and progressive literary and art workers in Hong Kong are currently making various preparations to welcome the liberation of South China.
    Huang Yaomian reported that in his forty days in the Northeast, he visited areas such as Harbin, Changchun, Fushun, Anshan, Benxi, Lushun, and Dalian, mainly visiting industrial construction. This visit made them deeply aware of the truth that labor creates the world; strengthened their thinking of relying on the working class to build a new society; and more clearly saw the bright prospects of China's industrialization.
    Huang Mo pointed out when reporting on the literary and art work situation in Wuhan that because the Wuhan area had long been subjected to oppression and blockade by the Kuomintang reactionary rule, many places still retain the remnants of feudal culture. Therefore, a large number of literary and art workers are needed to go there to pioneer. He also raised the issue of communicating rural and urban literary and art activities in response to the current needs of the Central China New District.
    Xia Yan, Shao Quanlin, and Huang Mo all emphasized the importance of reforming old operas, especially local operas, in their speeches. Shaoxing opera in Shanghai, Cantonese opera and tea-picking opera in South China, and Chu opera in Wuhan all have a large audience. The reform of Shaoxing opera has achieved preliminary results.
    Finally, Liu Baiyu enthusiastically talked about literary and art activities in the army. He said that the army urgently needs literature and art. The Literary and Art Congress gave a strong impetus to the literary and art movement in the army. He reported that the Fourth Field Army is preparing to hold an army-wide literary and art work conference next spring. He hopes that everyone can create more new works with high ideological content for the soldiers.

　　全国文联正副主席
　  招待新近抵平文艺工作者文代大会东北参观团
    夏衍等报告各地文艺工作黄药眠盛赞东北工业建设
    【本报讯】全国文联正副主席郭沫若、茅盾、周扬于十三日下午二时在中山公园来今雨轩招待新近抵平的各地文艺工作者及日前返平的文代大会东北参观团。到夏衍、邵荃麟、荒煤、刘白羽、任白戈、梅兰芳、周信芳、袁雪芬、冯雪峰、巴金等六十余人。会上夏衍、邵荃麟、荒煤、刘白羽分别报告上海、香港、武汉等地及部队文艺工作情况。东北参观团团长黄药眠报告东北参观归来的感想。
    夏衍报告中指出上海解放后文艺工作获得成绩，其重要原因之一，是上海有长期进步文艺活动的传统和基础，上海一解放，影剧协会即组织了三十几个宣传队到街头、工厂进行宣传。文代大会后，上海文艺界的团结更前进一步，新旧艺人都能很好的合作起来。目前需要的，是将文艺工作对象从有组织的群众扩展到一般市民中去，通过各种形式向广大群众进行思想教育。同时要求大量反映江南人民生活的作品。
    邵荃麟报告在香港，帝国主义者正加紧对进步文化的压迫，香港进步文艺工作者，目前正为迎接华南的解放，进行各种准备工作。
    黄药眠报告在东北四十天中，参观了哈尔滨、长春、抚顺、鞍山、本溪、旅顺、大连等地区，主要的是参观工业建设。这次的参观使他们深切地认识了劳动创造世界的真理；并坚定了依靠工人阶级建立新社会的思想；同时更明确地看到了中国工业化前途的光明远景。
    荒煤报告武汉文艺工作情况时，指出武汉地区因长期受国民党反动统治压迫与封锁，许多地方还都遗留着封建文化的残余势力，因此很需要大批的文艺工作者前去开荒。他并针对目前华中新区的需要，提出了沟通农村与城市文艺活动的问题。
    夏衍、邵荃麟、荒煤在讲话中均提出了改革旧剧，特别是地方戏的重要。上海绍兴剧，华南的粤剧、采茶戏，武汉的楚剧均拥有广大观众，绍兴戏的改革已获初步成绩。
    最后刘白羽热情地讲述了部队中的文艺活动，他说部队迫切需要文艺。文代大会给了部队文艺运动以有力的推动。他报告第四野战军准备于明春召开全军文艺工作会议。他希望大家能为战士们多多创作思想性高的新作品。
