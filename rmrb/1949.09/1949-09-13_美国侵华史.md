A History of American Aggression Against China
Liu Danian

3. Striving for Hegemony in China (Continued XIV)

	The following year—1920—the American counterattack began. The first step was to launch the Zhili-Anhui War. At this time, the Zhili faction, relying on British and American support and led by Cao Kun and Wu Peifu, gained important territories in Hebei, Henan, Jiangsu, Jiangxi, and Hubei provinces. Therefore, the Anhui faction had to allow the Zhili faction to participate in the Beijing government, and Zhili's Jin Yunpeng then acquired the position of Prime Minister and Minister of the Army. The Zhili and Anhui factions secretly united with Sun Yat-sen to weaken each other. Taking advantage of the rising anti-Japanese and anti-Duan sentiment among the Chinese people, the United States, through the Zhili faction, ignited the war in July. Cao Kun preemptively sent a letter to the diplomatic corps in Beijing, saying that Japan "has assisted the Anfu clique's army, not only providing military supplies, but also participating in combat activities" (Note: Oriental Magazine, Vol. 17, No. 15; Xu Zhiyan's "A Complete Account of the Tenth Anniversary of the Republic of China," Lower Volume.). He requested the diplomatic corps to stop it. In fact, the United States, behind the Zhili faction, had been making the same efforts as Japan. Duan Qirui was quickly defeated, and key figures of the Anhui faction, such as Xu Shuzheng and Duan Zhigui, fled into the Japanese embassy one after another. The United States also opposed the Japanese embassy sheltering the fugitives, saying that they did not deserve to be treated as "political prisoners." This was the first victory of the American counterattack.

	Next, the New Bank Consortium organized by the United States was established in September, and the Beijing government was notified that the United States, Japan, Britain, and France would jointly provide loans to China. Originally, the United States was unwilling to withdraw from the Six-Power Bank Consortium. After World War I, Germany failed and Russia underwent revolution. Britain and France were jealous of Japan's rapid advance in China. Therefore, the United States seized the opportunity to launch a new bank consortium, attempting to combine British and French capital with the American Morgan Bank as the center to compete with Japan in investment in China. Initially, Morgan Bank's representative, Lamont, came to China to negotiate this matter, but was opposed by the Communications Clique, which was linked to Japan. Lamont then requested Japan to participate to break this resistance and, at the same time, to restrict Japan's independent activities in China. The United States, using its position as the initiator, took control of the leadership of the New Bank Consortium. This was another victory of the American counterattack.

	However, Japan did not suffer a fatal blow because of this. It quickly supported an emerging Fengtian faction, Zhang Zuolin's forces, to replace the role of the Anhui faction. Diplomatically, it also had an alliance with Britain and was expanding its military. Although the United States reversed its decline in the Paris Peace Conference, its victory was not consolidated. Shandong, which the United States coveted and disputed in the conference, was still in the hands of Japan. The United States had to find a way to resolve this. In addition, Britain was wavering between continuing to be pro-Japanese or anti-Japanese on the China issue, which led to the Washington Conference in 1921.

	The Washington Conference was convened by the United States to resolve the China issue, as stated clearly in the invitation issued by the US State Department: "The main purpose of inviting China is that the main agenda of the conference is related to China, and nothing can be resolved without its consent(?)" (Note: Oriental Magazine, Vol. 18, Nos. 18 and 19.). Therefore, although nine countries participated in the conference, the important players were only the United States, Japan, and Britain. The United States was obviously in a more advantageous position in this conference than in Paris. It gained some sympathy from Britain and employed former Secretary of State Lansing and former Minister to Beijing Reinsch (some say it was former Beijing government advisor Willoughby) as "advisors" to the Chinese delegation, manipulating and exploiting them as it pleased. US Secretary of State Hughes became the open "Supreme Representative" of China. Therefore, the United States smoothly obtained several unequal exchange benefits from Britain and Japan: one was to dismantle the Anglo-Japanese alliance that existed before and win Britain over to its side. When Britain expressed hesitation, the United States used the abolition of the Lansing-Ishii Agreement previously concluded with Japan as a condition for Britain to abolish the Anglo-Japanese alliance. The other was to unite with Britain to force Japan to accept a "5:5:3" (US and Britain 5, Japan 3) naval tonnage ratio. When Japan refused to accept it, it instructed the Beijing government representative to propose the discussion of the Twenty-One Demands. In turn, it used the "Far Eastern Committee" chaired by the United States to declare an indefinite adjournment as an exchange condition, forcing Japan to accept this naval ratio that guaranteed the United States' dominant position (Note: See Luo Jialun's "My Observation on China at the Washington Conference," published in "Washington Conference" compiled by Chen Bao and Oriental Magazine, Vol. 19, No. 2). The United States used this kind of fickle tactics to achieve the main purpose of consolidating its existing power in China and laying the foundation for further seizing hegemony in China. The passage of the "Four Principles" proposed by the United States at the meeting and the signing of the so-called Nine-Power Treaty, etc., were not only to restrict Japan, but also to oppose the Soviet Union.

	The only issue left unresolved was the Shandong issue. It was agreed that China would first "redeem" the Jiaoji Railway, and that "the bonds could only be purchased by Chinese, avoiding the form of loans." This was naturally a powerful step for the United States to gain Shandong from then on. At this time, Japan, through Zhang Zuolin's support for Liang Shiyi (leader of the Communications Clique, originally pro-British, later became a Japanese stooge), obtained the position of "Prime Minister" of the Beijing government. Japan's attitude towards the Shandong issue suddenly became tough, demanding that China must borrow from Japan to redeem the railway from Japan. The Washington Conference Beijing government representative, controlled by the United States, thought it necessary to "wait for contact with Britain and the United States before replying" (Note: Wu Peifu's telegram of January 5, 1922, published in Li Jianong's "A Political History of China in the Last Thirty Years" and Zhang Zisheng's "A True Record of the Zhili-Fengtian War," Oriental Magazine, Vol. 19, No. 8.). Liang Shiyi, controlled by Japan, instructed the representatives to make concessions to Japan. The imperialists' running dogs in China have always maintained their masters' interests meticulously. Wu Peifu, the strongman of the Zhili faction, was the first to come forward to oppose, saying that "Liang Shiyi is doing things that none of the previous cabinets dared to do...willing to be Li Wanyong and Zhang Bangchang without scruples" (Note: Wu Peifu's previous telegram.). Zhang Zuolin then counterattacked Wu, saying that he was "wantonly criticizing" and could not let Liang Shiyi "calmly deploy to achieve full success" (Note: Zhang Zuolin's telegram to the Central Government, published in the previous book). The ink on the Washington Conference signatures was not yet dry, and the struggle between the United States and Japan for China had already begun to change from their own negotiations to the cannons of their running dogs. Although the United States forced Japan to sign the Sino-Japanese Shandong Treaty in February 1922, stipulating that "the extension lines of the Jiaoji Railway (i.e., Jinan-Shunde Line and Gaomi-Xuzhou Line) be transferred to the international consortium (i.e., the New Bank Consortium of the United States)," (Note: Sino-Japanese Shandong Treaty, published in Qian Yishi's "A Diplomatic History of China," Living Bookstore, pp. 176-177.), the First Zhili-Fengtian War was unavoidable. The Chinese people were again subjected to large-scale slaughter by the American aggressors and their running dogs for their own interests.

	Zhang Zuolin was quickly defeated. Under the mediation of the Englishman De Couter (a missionary in Fengtian), the Fengtian faction withdrew from the customs, the Zhili faction expanded its territory, and American influence continued to rise. Xu Shichang was driven out, Liang Shiyi was arrested, and Sun Yat-sen hoped to gain American support at this time to become the "unified" Chinese president (Note: September 8, 1922, "The Talk Between the American Reporter and President Sun" published in The Guide, Issue 1, Cai Hesen's "Loans and the Kuomintang."). However, the United States lacked goodwill towards him because he had previously rejected its invitation and often colluded with the Japanese Fengtian faction, and chose Li Yuanhong, who had previously had relations with the United States, to come to power for the second time as a temporary tool.

  　三　争夺中国霸权　（续十四）
    第二年——一九二○年，美国的反攻即开始进行。首先是发动直皖战争。这时直系依靠英美支援以曹锟、吴佩孚为首取得河北、河南、江苏、江西、湖北等省重要地盘，因此皖系不得不允许直系参加北京政府，直系靳云鹏遂取得国务总理兼陆军总长的地位。直皖两系斗争，又各秘密联合孙中山以削弱对方。美国通过直系乘中国人民反日反段的高涨情绪，使战争于七月间打响，曹锟先发制人，致书北京公使团，说日本“有协助安福系军队之事，不但协济军用品，且有参与作战之活动”（注：东方杂志一七卷一五号；许指严民国十周年纪事本末，下册。）请公使团制止，事实上，美国在直系后面，早有了与日本同样的努力，段祺瑞很快战败，皖系要角徐树铮，段芝贵等纷纷逃入日本使馆，美国又对日馆收留逃员加以反对，说他们不配当做“政治犯”看待。这是美国反攻的第一个胜利。
    接着美国组织的新银行团又于九月间成立，通知北京政府以后美、日、英、法四国统一对华借款。原来美国从六国银行团退出并不甘心，世界大战后，德国失败，俄国革命，英法嫉视日本在华急进，美国遂乘机发起一个新银行团，企图以美国摩根银行为中心，结合英法资本，在中国与日本在投资竞争。最初摩根银行代表拉门德来中国作此项交涉，被与日本连结的交通系反对，拉门德转请日本参加打破这种阻力，同时借此限制日本对华单独活动，美国运用发起人的地位，掌握了新银行团的领导权，这是美国反攻的又一个胜利。
    但日本并没有因此遭受制命打击，它很快扶持了一个新兴的奉系张作霖势力以代替皖系作用，外交上还与英国有同盟关系，又在扩张军备，美国虽挽回巴黎和会中的颓势，胜利却不巩固，为美国垂涎而在和会所争执的山东也仍在日本手中，美国均须设法解决，再加英国在中国问题上处于继续亲日或反日的动摇中，遂产生一九二一年的华盛顿会议。
    华盛顿会议是美国为解决中国问题而召集的，这在美国国务院发出的请谍中说得很明白：“邀请中国之主旨，则为该会之主要议案均与中国有关，苟不得其同意（？），无论何事当然不能解决。”（注：东方杂志一八卷一八、一九号。）所以与会的虽有九个国家，重要演员却只有美、日、英三国。美国在这次会议中显然与在巴黎不同，一开始便处于有利地位，既得英国某种同情，更以前国务卿蓝辛及前驻北京公使芮茵斯（一说为前北京政府顾问韦罗贝）为中国代表团“顾问”，操纵利用，唯其所欲，美国务卿许士竟成为公开的中国“太上代表”。因此美国很顺利地从英日方面取得了几个不等价的交换利益：一个是把这以前的英日同盟拆散，争取英国到自己方面来，当英国表示犹豫时，美国以废除以前与日本订立的蓝辛石井协定为交换条件，使英国废除了英日同盟。再一个是联合英国强迫日本接受一个“五五三”（美英五，日三）的海军吨位比率，当日本不接受时、指使北京政府代表提出二十一条要求讨论，翻过来，又以美国所主持讨论此问题的“远东委员会”宣告无限期延会为交换条件，使日本接受了这个保证美国优势地位的海军比率（注：参看罗家伦我对于中国在华盛顿会议之观察，载晨报社编华盛顿会议及东方杂志一九卷二号）。美国用此种翻云覆雨手段达到了巩固其在中国现有势力的主要目的，并安置下进一步夺取中国霸权的基础。会议上对美国所提“四项原则”的通过，及所谓九国公约的签订等，除为限制日本外，还带有反对苏联的作用。
    最后没有解决的只剩下山东问题，议定由中国先“赎回”胶济路，“债票仅华人购买，避去借款形式”，这自然是美国从此争得山东的一个有力步骤。就在这时，日本经过张作霖支持梁士诒（交通系首领，原亲英，后又变为日本走狗）获得北京政府“国务总理”的位置，日本对山东问题态度突变强硬，要中国从日本手中赎路必须向日本借款。美国掌握中的华盛顿北京政府代表以为要“俟与英美接洽后再答”（注：吴佩孚一九二二年一月五日通电，载李剑农最近三十年中国政治史及东方杂志一九卷八号张梓生直奉战争纪实。）而日本掌握中的梁士诒则训令华会代表对日让步。帝国主义在中国的走狗，对其主子的利益向来是维护唯谨的，直系实力派吴佩孚首先出面反对，说是“举历任内阁所不忍为不敢为者，梁士诒乃悍然为之………甘为李完用张邦昌而弗恤”（注：吴佩孚前电。）张作霖则对吴反攻，说他“肆意讥弹”，不能让梁士诒“从容展布克竟全功”（注：张作霖致中央电，载前书）。华盛顿会议签字墨迹未干，美国与日本争夺中国的斗争，已开始由他们自己折冲樽俎变为他们走狗的炮火相见。美国虽逼使日本于一九二二年二月签定中日山东条约规定：“胶济铁路二线延长线（即济南顺德线高密徐州线）让与国际银团（按：即美国的新银行团）”，（注：中日山东条约，载钱亦石中国外交史，生活书店本，一七六——一七七页。）但第一次直奉战争已无法避免。中国人民被美国侵略者及其走狗为了他们的利益又遭到大规模屠杀。
    张作霖还是很快战败。在英国人德库脱尔（驻奉天传教士）调停下奉系出关，直系地盘扩展，美国势力一直上升，徐世昌被逐，梁士诒落网，孙中山这时希望得到美国支持当“统一”的中国总统（注：一九二二年九月八日，民国日报美记者与孙总统之谈话，载向导一期蔡和森借款与国民党。）美国却因他以前曾拒绝自己邀请，又常与日奉勾结，对之缺乏好感，而选择了与美国曾有关系的黎元洪第二次上台，作为暂时工具。
