　　Love and Work
    Xu Zaiyong
    One day, several of us went to talk to a comrade about the issue of "youth love." At first, he was very modest and refused to talk, claiming that he hadn't studied the issue. But after our repeated requests, he finally agreed to share a few real-life examples for our reference and help in dealing with such problems. He stated that this was only his personal opinion and not necessarily the most correct one. Then he said:
    "Remember what Romain Rolland said: 'What is love? In happiness, it dissolves your will; in unhappiness, it crushes your heart. What benefit does it bring you?' If we handle love issues from a petty-bourgeois perspective, Romain Rolland's words are correct; if we handle love issues from a Marxist-Leninist perspective, with a proletarian viewpoint, Romain Rolland's words are wrong."
    "Just talking theory might not be clear to you, so let me tell you a few more stories to help you understand."
    "A long time ago, when I was in training, there was a male comrade and a female comrade in the same training group who were very close, practically 'inseparable.' Except for sleeping separately, they were together from morning to wash their faces, eat, and attend lectures, and after class, they would study and discuss together. They only cared about being close to each other and unknowingly fell into the problem of forming a 'small circle,' not getting close to other comrades, not helping other comrades, and not heeding other comrades' well-intentioned criticism. I happened to be in the same group as them, and a group only had six people, but it was divided into four people together and two people together. Later, the four of us gave them our opinions, hoping that they would not isolate themselves too far from other comrades, but they didn't listen and even said some unpleasant things, saying that we were jealous of their happiness. At that time, our self-cultivation was also very poor, like children, and we stopped persuading them out of spite, and didn't reflect this opinion to the higher-ups, letting them develop in this way. After graduation, by chance, they were separated far apart due to work needs, and they felt distressed. Their performance at work was passive, and their ideological awareness was detached from the masses. A long period of living together had turned him into someone who had no one to talk to except her, and she was the same. Just as Romain Rolland said—in happiness, it dissolves your will; in unhappiness, it crushes your heart. He and she were both distressed and wandering in their respective locations. At that time, the organization discovered this problem, and after considering it, felt that the solution was not to transfer them together; in that way, they would form a small circle again and deepen their mistakes. So, the organization carried out persuasion and advice work, telling them that revolutionary interests should be higher than personal interests. It took a long time to persuade them, and then they were transferred together. This time, they handled the relationship between husband and wife and comrades, and the relationship between work and life very well."
    "Also, let me tell you about a model couple, who were students. At that time, the Kuomintang-controlled areas were very strict with inspections, and to make it easier on the road, they pretended to be a couple. After arriving in the liberated areas, their feelings grew better day by day, and the fake couple became a real couple. At first, they worked together, but later, due to work needs, they were assigned to two different places. When they were together, their feelings were very good, their work was very conscientious and responsible, and their relationship with comrades was also very good. After they separated, their work was just as active. Once, I asked the man: 'Don't you miss her?' He replied: 'Of course I miss her, but work is more important. I can't let personal feelings hinder my work. Although we are separated in two places, our work is a whole. When I'm working, I always feel like she's encouraging me by my side.'"
    "Finally, I want to offer a principle, which is that after male and female comrades fall in love, they should contribute even more to their work. To put it in a mathematical formula: 'One plus one does not equal two.' In other words, 'the results of two people working together should be greater than the sum of the results of two people working alone.' I hope you all handle it as well as that second example."

　　恋爱和工作
    徐在庸
    有一天，我们几个人去找一位同志漫谈关于“青年恋爱”的问题。他起初很谦虚，不肯讲，推说自己没有研究过这问题。但经过我们再三的要求，他终于答应说几个实在的例子，供给我们作处理问题的参考和帮助。他声明这只是他个人的看法，并不一定是最正确的看法，然后他说：
    “记得罗曼罗兰说：‘爱情是什么？幸福时，它消融你的意志；不幸时，它拗折你的心。它有什么裨益给你？’假如我们照小资产阶级的观点去处理恋爱问题，罗曼罗兰的话是对的；假如我们从马列主义的观点，用无产阶级的观点去处理恋爱问题，罗曼罗兰的话就是错的。”
    “光说理论，也许你们还不大明白，我再说几个故事来帮助你们了解。”
    “很久以前，在我受训的时候，和我一同受训的有一位男同志和一位女同志，他们两人很要好，简直是所谓‘形影不离’，除了睡觉分开之后，从早上起来，洗脸，吃饭，上大课都在一起，下课后两人也在一起研究和讨论。他们只顾两个人要好，不知不觉就犯了‘小圈子’的毛病，不和别的同志接近，不帮助别的同志，也不理会别的同志善意的批评。我正好和他两在一个小组，一个小组只有六个人，却又分成四个人一块，两个人一块，后来我们四个人就对他们两提出意见，希望他们不要与别的同志隔离太远，但他们不听，反说出些不好听的话，说我们嫉妒他们的幸福。那时我们的修养也差得很，象小孩子似的，一赌气便不再劝他们，也没对上面反映这意见，让他们这样发展下去。到毕业之后，碰巧因为工作上的需要，他们两个人分离得很远，他们便感到苦恼了，在工作表现上是消极，在行动意识上是脱离群众。长时期的两个人在一起的生活，使他变成除了她，便没有可以谈话的人，她也是一样，正如罗曼罗兰所说的——幸福时，消融了你的意志；不幸时便拗折了你的心。他和她在两处同样是苦恼、彷徨，那时，组织上发现了这问题，考虑之后，觉得解决问题的办法，不在于把他们调在一起；那样，他们又会成一个小圈子，而更加深他们的错误，便进行了说服和劝告的工作，告诉他们革命利益应该高于个人的利益。很久之后，才把他们说通了，然后才把他们调到一起，这次他们就把夫妇和同志的关系，工作和生活的关系都弄得很好了。”
    “另外，我再说一对模范夫妇，那是一对学生。那时从国统区到解放区查得很严，为了路上方便些，他们装作夫妇，到解放区后，感情一天天的好，假夫妻就变成真夫妻了。起初他们是在一起工作，后来为了工作上的需要，分到两个不同的地方。在一起时，他们的感情很好，工作很认真负责，和同志们的关系也搞得很好；分开之后，他们工作也同样的积极。有一次，我问那个男的：‘你不想她吗？’他回答说：‘想当然是想，但是工作更重要，不能为了个人的情感而妨碍了工作。虽然我们人分开在两地，工作却是一整个，工作时我总好象觉得她在旁边鼓励我似的。’”
    “末了我想提供一个原则，那就是男女同志经过恋爱之后，对于工作贡献应该更大。用个算术公式来说就是：‘一加一不等于二’，换句话说就是‘两个人在一起工作的成绩，应该比两个人单独工作成绩的总和大。’我希望你们都象那第二个例子那一对处理得那末好。”
