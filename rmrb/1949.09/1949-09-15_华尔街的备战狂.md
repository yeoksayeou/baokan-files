　　Wall Street's War Preparations Mania
　　Duan Liancheng
　　One day in April this year, a large number of journalists and military and political dignitaries gathered at an airport in the central United States to welcome the "Lucky Lady III." This glamorous name referred to a new type of the largest bomber. It flew around the world for a week without landing to refuel, and returned to the United States. After landing, the commander on board said to reporters: "The significance of our flight is to prove that American aircraft can send atomic bombs to any part of the Soviet Union and then return safely." Secretary of Defense Forrestal, who was present, was somewhat embarrassed to hear such a blatant statement. He immediately asked the reporters to correct him, saying that it was not to send atomic bombs to "any part of the Soviet Union" but to "any part of the world" to show that their target was not the Soviet Union. Despite the attempts of this banking boss, who served as Secretary of Defense, to cover up the conspiracy of Wall Street's reactionary capitalist group to actively prepare for war against the Soviet Union, it was revealed by the military man they had supported.

　　"Artificial Satellite" Dream
　　In the frenzy of war preparations, the reactionaries who worship force are, of course, most concerned with expanding armaments. Democrat Truman, before last year's election, trotted out many of the enlightened programs of the late President Roosevelt to win the people's votes and achieve an unexpected victory. Since entering the White House, most of the bills Truman promoted to the people were debated in Congress and then shelved. Only on one matter did the congressmen show unprecedented enthusiasm. That was the military budget bill. Truman asked for more than 15.2 billion U.S. dollars in military spending, and the House of Representatives passed it as is with 271 votes to 1, and even added 600 million because it felt it wasn't enough. The total U.S. budget for 1949 was 42.2 billion U.S. dollars, and military spending accounted for as much as 38 percent. It didn't seem like peacetime. The only representative of the progressive faction in the "democratic" Congress, Labor Party leader Marcantonio, cast the sole vote against this military budget bill.

　　The House of Representatives added 600 million in military spending in order to expand the already huge air force to 70 groups, so there would be nearly 7,000 first-line aircraft. The three branches of the military under the Department of Defense, the Army, Navy, and Air Force, have always competed for money and power and have been at odds. After the passage of this budget that favored the Air Force, the Navy was very jealous and kept arguing. Secretary of Defense Forrestal was so anxious in early summer that he jumped out of a building and died. His successor, Louis Johnson, went a step further and ordered the Navy to stop building the largest aircraft carrier, the "United States." Secretary of the Navy Sullivan, out of anger, resigned. In order to "make up" for the feelings of the three branches of the military, Johnson once ordered the chiefs of staff of the three branches to play a few rounds of golf together. Recently, rumors have it that they have agreed that the "strategic bombing" mission (which is actually dropping atomic bombs on the Soviet Union) should be done by the Air Force, and the Navy should not compete for it. These quarrels fully reflect the eagerness of the military chiefs for war.

　　At the same time, the U.S. government is recruiting soldiers on a large scale. Last year, Congress passed the peacetime conscription law, and all men between the ages of eighteen and thirty-six are being trained and incorporated into the reserves one after another. Newspapers and magazines often have advertisements for recruitment, occasionally depicting overseas "Jeep girls." The radio is the same. Last year, in a small city, I often heard a female announcer say after a "jazz" song: "High school students, it's good to join the army, don't worry about unemployment, high pay, easy promotion, run overseas quickly, go to the post office upstairs to register."

　　In addition, reactionaries are more actively manufacturing atomic weapons. The United States originally had two large atomic bomb factories, one in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, and one in Los Alamos, New Mexico. Recently, a larger manufacturing plant has begun to be built in Idaho. In the Department of Defense's recent report to Congress, it also briefly mentioned a plan to build an "artificial satellite" outside the atmosphere, using radar to direct the projection of atomic bombs, guaranteeing a 100 percent hit rate; at the same time, this satellite can be used as a springboard for future conquest of the moon. The American rulers' dream of conquering by force has not only reached the whole world but also the entire universe.

　　Busy Seeking Accomplices
　　In terms of diplomacy, all the measures of the reactionaries, simply put, are to find accomplices. The second year of funding for the Marshall Plan has been allocated as a bait. The signing of the North Atlantic Treaty is intended to tie down that group of partners with a chain, so that they will not retreat at the last minute. More recently, Congress extended its session and is discussing military aid to the signatories of the North Atlantic Treaty. At the same time, it is more actively promoting the so-called "Pacific Alliance."

　　Among those recruited as thugs, the aggression-prone German and Japanese fascists are, of course, ideal talents. Thus, in April of this year, the so-called "West German Federal Constitution" was produced in Bonn, Germany, followed by an announcement to stop dismantling 159 important military factories. The purpose is to quickly restore militaristic Germany to be at the forefront of the war against the Soviet Union. As for Japan, the situation is the same. In the United States, you often see many photos of Japan, the content of which is nothing more than the thin emperor shaking hands with the common people, the plump queen talking to female workers, and the shaven-headed prince playing games with his classmates. All of this shows that Japan has been "democratized," so reparations are reduced, war criminals are released, industrial standards are raised, and consular relations are established. The intention, of course, is also to deal with the Soviet Union. Even more amazing is that Franco of Spain has also become a major general in the eyes of the reactionaries. Because, according to the U.S. military, the Soviet army is strong, and once war breaks out, it may sweep across the European continent within a month. If you go to land again like in World War II, it will be quite difficult. It is best to pull in Franco, establish a strong base in Spain, and rely on the natural barrier of the Pyrenees Mountains to hold the Iberian Peninsula and quickly fight back.

　　Cheerleaders Are Working Hard
　　Another important task of war preparation is war propaganda. The news and broadcasting industries, which are controlled by monopoly capitalists, have been very enthusiastic in creating a war atmosphere. On April 2, war profiteer Churchill gave a speech at MIT in Massachusetts. When he arrived at the pier, many workers and progressives held up large placards, expressing their disapproval. One old lady's sign read: "You like the glory of war, but I can't bear to part with my son. Please go back, take your cigars, your war." Only a very few progressive newspapers published this simple voice of the people. Churchill's anti-Soviet clamor, however, was the headline news of the vast majority of newspapers across the country.

　　Earlier this year, a staff member of the Department of Justice, Miss Coplon, was accused by the FBI of being a Soviet spy because of her contact with a Soviet engineer working at the United Nations. A girl who is not ugly, plus the title of a spy, is, of course, a great material for the American press, which has always paid attention to yellow news. So it was published heavily, and it is still not finished. The underlying intention is to create a psychological panic among the people, thinking that Soviet spies have already densely distributed everywhere, trying to attack the United States. Similarly, the "espionage" case of former State Department official Hiss, the trial of the twelve leaders of the American Communist Party, saying that they "conspired to overthrow the government by violence," and the frequently appearing "unidentified submarines invading American territorial waters," "atomic secrets leaked," and other headlines were all sensationalized.

　　In the political arena, we can also see the activeness of the reactionaries in preparing for war everywhere. In general, it is the rapid strengthening of fascism. For example, the FBI has transformed from a basically criminal detective agency into a political intelligence organization; another example is the Un-American Activities Committee, which has been established in many state legislatures, throwing "red hats" everywhere and actively persecuting progressive people; finally, all open or secret fascist organizations, such as the National Association of Manufacturers, veterans' associations, and the Ku Klux Klan, are becoming increasingly rampant. Due to space limitations, this article does not intend to elaborate.

　　The Rat's Incisors
　　The vast majority of the American people are basically peace-loving. Why is this country so war-crazed? One American progressive said at a lecture: On the seaward tip of Manhattan in New York, there stands a large area of dozens of stories of high-rise buildings, which hide a group of fat old rats. The rats' incisors grow very fast. They not only steal human food but also gnaw through clothes and furniture, because only by doing so can they shorten their incisors and continue to survive. This piece of high-rise building is Wall Street; this group of big rats is the monopoly capitalists; the incisors are the productivity of the large enterprises they own or control. In the Second World War, the big capitalists made a fortune by manufacturing munitions. The people saved money by being frugal and enduring hardships. After the war, everyone scrambled to buy things, and consumer goods such as radios, washing machines, and electric refrigerators were all expensive and difficult to buy. A $3,000 car would sell for more than $5,000 on the black market. Gradually, the people's savings were all given to the capitalists. Prices fell, but no one bought them. For example, Kaiser Company's cars have recently fallen to $1,800. The big rats' incisors are getting longer and longer, and they have to find something to destroy. Mass production of munitions and seizing the world market is the only way.

　　The highest stage of capitalism is imperialism; the economic system determines Wall Street's road to war. If the big rats use war to grind their incisors, the awakened masses will definitely beat them to death. If there is no war, their incisors will definitely grow so long that they cannot survive. There is no cure because history has destined the demise of Wall Street and the system it represents.

### 华尔街的备战狂

　　华尔街的备战狂
    段连城
    今年四月里的一天，在美国中部某机场，聚集了大批新闻记者、军政要人，欢迎“幸运夫人第三氏”。这个艳丽的名字，指的是一架最大的新型轰炸机。它环飞世界一周，没有着陆加油，回到美国。机上的指挥员，在降落之后，对记者第一句话便说：“我们此次飞行的意义，在于证明了美国飞机，能够把原子弹送到苏联任何一个地方，然后安全回来。”在场的国防部长福莱斯特尔，听到这样露骨的话，有些受窘。他立刻要求记者们更正，说不是把原子弹送到“苏联任何一个地方”，而是“世界的任何一个地方”，以表明他们的目标不是苏联。尽管这位任国防部长的银行老板，要想遮掩，华尔街反动资本家集团对苏积极备战的阴谋，是让他们所豢养的那个军人一语道破了。
    “人造卫星”梦
    在备战热狂中，迷信武力的反动派，最关心的当然是扩充军备。民主党的杜鲁门，在去年大选前，搬出了许多故总统罗斯福的开明政纲，骗取人民的选票，得到一个意外的胜利。自入白宫以来，杜氏对老百姓宣传过的法案，送到国会，多是辩论一通，不了了之。只有在一件事上，议员先生们表现了空前的热忱。那即是军事预算案。杜鲁门开口要的军费是一百五十二亿余美元，下议院以二百七十一票对一票，如数通过，想想不够，外加六亿。美国一九四九年的总预算，是四百二十二亿元，军费高达百分之三十八，那里象和平时期的办法。对这军事预算案投单独一张反对票的，正是“民主”议院里唯一的一个进步派代表，劳工党领袖麦堪东尼奥。
    下议院外加军费六亿，为的是要把已经庞大的空军扩展到七十大队，如此则第一线飞机，便有几乎七千架之多。国防部下面的海陆空三军，一向争钱争势，本已不和。这个偏袒空军的预算通过后，海军大为吃醋，吵闹不休。国防部长福莱斯特尔，夏初急得跳楼，一命呜呼。继任人路易·詹森，更进一步，下令海军停造最大的航空母舰“美国号”。海军部长沙利文，一气之余，挂冠而去。为了“弥补”三军感情，詹森曾经命令三军参谋总长，在一起打几场高尔夫球。最近，传闻已经同意，“战略轰炸”任务（事实上就是把原子弹丢到苏联的工作），由空军来干，海军不得争夺。这些争吵，充分地反映了军部首脑们对战争的渴盼心情。
    同时，美国政府正在大规模地招兵。去年国会通过了平时兵役法，凡十八岁至三十六岁的男子，都在陆续受训，编入后备中。报刊杂志常有招兵的广告，间或还画出海外的“吉普女郎”。广播也是一样，笔者去年在一个小城，常常听到一曲“爵士”之后，女播音员说：“高中生，从军好，不愁失业待遇高，升级容易海外跑，快到邮局楼上把名报”。
    另外，反动派更积极地制造原子武器。美国本来有两个大原子弹工厂，一在田纳西州的奥可立，一在新墨西哥州的洛萨拉摩。最近在伊达赫州，开始建立一个更大的制造厂。在国防部最近对国会的报告书中，另外极简短地提到一个计划，要在大气圈外，建立一个“人造卫星”，用雷达指挥原子弹投射，可保百发百中；同时，这卫星可以做今后进占月球的跳板。美国统治者的武力征服梦，不但做到全世界，而且做到全宇宙了。
    找寻帮凶忙
    在外交方面，反动派的一切措施，简单说来，就是找寻帮凶。马歇尔计划的第二年经费，已经拨出，作为利诱的饵。北大西洋盟约的签订，是想用一条链子，拴住那群伙伴，让他们不要临阵退缩。最近国会延期，正在讨论对北大西洋盟约签字国的军事援助。同时更积极策动所谓“太平洋联盟”。
    招募打手中，侵略成性的德日法西斯分子，当然是理想人才。于是今年四月，在德国波昂城搞出了所谓“西德联邦宪法”，接着宣布停止拆卸一百五十九个重要的军火工厂。目的是想迅速恢复军国主义的德国，在对苏战争中打头阵。致于日本，情形也相同。在美国常常看到许多关于日本的照片，内容不外是瘦瘦的天皇和老百姓握手，胖胖的皇后与女工谈天，剃光头的皇子和同学游戏。这一切都表示日本已经“民主化”了，于是减低赔偿，释放战犯，提高工业水准，建立领事关系。用意当然也是对付苏联。更妙的是西班牙的佛朗哥，也成了反动派心目中的一员大将。因为据美国军部估计：苏联陆军强大，一旦战争爆发，一个月内可能横扫欧陆。如果象第二次大战一样，再去登陆，相当困难。最好拉住佛朗哥，在西班牙建立强大基地，靠比利牛斯山的天险，守住西伯利安半岛，很快打回去。
    啦啦队起劲
    备战的另一个重要工作，是战争宣传。在垄断资本家控制下的新闻广播事业，对战争空气的制造，一直非常起劲。四月二日，战争大贩子邱吉尔到美国麻省理工学院演讲。当他到码头的时候，许多工人及进步分子，抬着大纸牌，表示不欢迎。一位老太太的牌上写道：“你喜好战争的光荣，我舍不得我的儿子。请你回去，带走你的雪茄，你的战争。”这种朴质的人民呼声，只有极少数进步报纸刊登。而邱吉尔的反苏叫嚣，却是全国极大多数报纸的头条新闻。
    今年初，司法部的一位职员戈白兰小姐，因为和在联合国工作的一位苏联工程司有来往，便被特务机构联邦调查局指控为苏联间谍。一个长得不丑的女孩子，加上一个间谍头衔，对素来注重黄色消息的美国新闻界，当然是大好材料。于是大登特登，至今未完。内在的用意，是要在民间造成一种恐慌心理，以为苏联间谍，已经密布各处，处心积虑，要打美国。同样被渲染的，如前国务院要员赫士的“间谍”案；审判美共十二领袖，说他们“阴谋用暴力推翻政府”；以及经常出现的“不明国籍潜艇，侵入美国领海”、“原子秘密泄漏”等等头号字大标题。
    政治方面，也处处看得出反动派备战的积极。概括而言，是法西斯化的迅速加强。譬如联邦调查局，已由一个基本上是刑事侦探的机构，转变成一个政治性的特务组织；再如非美活动委员会，已在许多州议会里成立，乱丢“红帽子”，对进步人士积极迫害；最后是一切公开或秘密的法西斯组织，如全国制造厂商联合会，退伍军人会及三Ｋ党等的日愈猖獗。篇幅有限，本文不拟详述了。
    老鼠的门牙
    美国的广大人民，基本上是爱好和平的。为什么这个国家会如此战争狂呢。有一位美国进步党人，在一个演讲会上说：在纽约蒙汉顿区靠海的尖角上，耸立着一大片数十层的高楼，里面藏了一群肥胖的大老鼠。老鼠的门牙长得很快。它们不但偷窃人类的食物，而且要啃破衣服家具，因为只有这样做，才能磨短它们的门牙，继续生存。这片高楼就是华尔街；这群大老鼠便是垄断资本家；门牙就是他们拥有或控制的大企业的生产力。在第二次大战中，大资本家们制造军火，大发其财。人民节约吃苦，省下几个钱。战争结束，大家争买东西，无线电、洗衣机、电气冰箱等民生用品，全都贵而难买，三千元的汽车，黑市要卖五千余。逐渐地，老百姓的积蓄都送给资本家了。东西跌价，还是没有人买，譬如凯塞公司的汽车最近已跌至一千八百元。大老鼠们的门牙，愈来愈长，非找东西来破坏不行。大量制造军火及霸占世界市场，是唯一的办法。
    资本主义的最高阶段是帝国主义；经济制度决定了华尔街的战争道路。大老鼠们要是用战争来磨门牙，定让觉醒了的广大人民打死。要是没有战争，他们的门牙一定长得使他们不能生存。没有救药，因为历史注定了华尔街及其所代表的制度的灭亡。
