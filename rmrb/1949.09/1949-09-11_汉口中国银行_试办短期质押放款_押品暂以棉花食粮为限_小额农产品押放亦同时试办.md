　　Hankou Bank of China
　　Pilots Short-Term Pledge Loans
　　Collateral Limited to Cotton and Grain for Now
　　Small-Scale Agricultural Product Pledge Loans Also Piloted Simultaneously
　　[Hankou News] In order to promote the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas and develop production, the Hankou Branch of the Bank of China has been piloting short-term pledge loan business since the 27th of last month. Legitimate transportation and sales merchants who truly contribute to the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas can apply for this loan. The maximum amount per loan is 5 million yuan, while cooperatives or smaller merchants are temporarily limited to 3 million yuan. The maximum term is fifteen days. The interest rate is handled in accordance with the People's Bank of China Hankou Branch's regulations for commercial pledge loans, with a monthly interest rate of 21%, but it will be appropriately reduced if the market interbank offered rate falls. The collateral is temporarily limited to cotton and grain, and warehouse receipts from the bank's warehouses are used as collateral, all pledged at 60% of the market price. All applicants for this loan must find a reputable business as guarantor, and the collateral should be fully insured against fire at 70% of the market price with the Hankou China Property Insurance Company.
　　In addition, in order to cooperate with the work of the Municipal Trade Corporation's Rural Service Department and promote the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas, the bank will pilot small-scale agricultural product pledge loans starting from today. The maximum amount of each loan is provisionally set at 500,000 yuan, but it can be appropriately relaxed depending on the actual situation. Those who store agricultural products in the warehouses of the Rural Service Department can apply for this loan from the bank and its offices with the warehouse receipt issued by the warehouse, still pledged at 60% of the market price of the collateral, with interest calculated at a monthly rate of 18%, and a term of fifteen days. The remaining procedures are handled according to general loan procedures. This loan is aimed at small and medium-sized merchants engaged in the transportation and sales of local products. If the pilot project achieves good results, further expansion plans will be made.
