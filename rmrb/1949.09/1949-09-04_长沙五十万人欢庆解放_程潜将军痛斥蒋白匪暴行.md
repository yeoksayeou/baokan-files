He called on the people in the liberated areas to do their utmost to support the People's Liberation Army in its rapid advance to eliminate the remaining reactionary forces. General Xiao Jingguang pointed out in his speech that the great victory of Changsha's liberation was due to the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the strength of the People's Liberation Army, and the "anti-sabotage," "anti-migration," and anti-grain, anti-conscription, and anti-tax struggles carried out by people from all walks of life in Changsha, and directly due to the glorious uprising of Generals Cheng Qian and Chen Mingren.

He also called on all patriotic people in the remaining Kuomintang army to learn from the glorious uprising of Generals Cheng and Chen and resolutely stand on the side of the people. General Chen Mingren excitedly said in his speech that the path he had taken this time was the right one. He said: "What I am ashamed of and owe to the people is that the First Army Corps I led took the wrong path in the past and harmed the people. But today I can responsibly tell all my compatriots: I am determined to lead the First Army Corps to learn from the Liberation Army and improve to become a true people's armed force, fighting for the interests of the people." Subsequently, representatives of workers, peasants, and combat heroes spoke. After the meeting passed telegrams to Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and Commander Lin Biao, the torches were lit and the parade began. Thousands of torches circled the entire city, and there were cheers, songs, and firecrackers everywhere, which did not stop until midnight.
