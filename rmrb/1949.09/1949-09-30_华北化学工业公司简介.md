　　Brief Introduction of the North China Chemical Industry Company
    In order to strengthen the leadership of the chemical industry in North China, the North China People's Government has merged the North China Branch of the Military-Controlled China Salt Industry Company, the Military-Controlled Tianjin Chemical Industry Company, the Military-Controlled Weixin Chemical Plant (including the Military-Controlled Defu Bayer Plant, the Military-Controlled Hangu Daqing Factory, and the Military-Controlled Hangu Weixin Plant), and the Military-Controlled Shijingshan Chemical Plant to organize the North China Chemical Industry Company, and a preparatory office was established on August 1st. Its tasks are: 1. To quickly establish a chemical industry foundation. 2. To plan the development of heavy chemical industry and basic chemical industry. 3. To improve product quality. 4. To study the problems that need to be solved in the process of restoring and developing the chemical industry. 5. To cooperate with the overall development direction of the chemical industry, and to conduct comprehensive surveys and research work on a regular basis (including marine industry, coal processing industry, acid and artificial fertilizer industry, and other important chemical raw material industries). At present, the factories under the North China Chemical Industry Company Preparatory Office include: Dagu No. 3 Factory, Hangu No. 1 Factory, Hangu No. 2 Factory, Tianjin No. 3 Factory, and Weixin Chemical Plant. Products include bleaching powder, solid caustic soda, sodium sulfate, gypsum, magnesium hydroxide, bone glue, synthetic hydrochloric acid, magnesium oxide, degelatinized bone meal, bone meal fertilizer, sulfur black, sodium sulfide, remade salt, washing salt, physiological saline, magnesium sulfate and soap, etc.
    Since the resumption of work after takeover, the output of each factory has increased significantly; in terms of quality, it has reached the pre-liberation level, and there has been further improvement. For example, the average daily output of remade salt in Dagu Factory used to be 1.4866 tons, but now it has increased to 7.95 tons; the average daily output of sulfur black in Weixin Factory has increased from 0.24 tons to 1.217 tons; sodium sulfide has increased from 0.666 tons to 2.1452 tons. The average daily output of bone glue in Tianjin Factory has increased from 0.5323 tons to 1.5 tons. The bleaching powder produced by Hangu No. 1 Factory used to be only 26 degrees, but now it has reached 30 degrees; the washing salt produced by Hangu No. 2 Factory is also whiter and larger than before; the sulfur black produced by Weixin Factory was originally 100%, but now it has risen to 108.3% (this is the average, the highest individual reaches 133.3%). The company's products such as salt making, sodium sulfide, caustic soda, and synthetic hydrochloric acid occupy an important position in the national production. The remade salt produced by Dagu Factory is the first of its kind in China, and its quality is comparable to that of table salt made in the United States. Physiological saline, in today's lack of foreign goods, has become a very valuable medical necessity. The washing salt washed with brine by Hangu No. 2 Factory is white and large, which can prevent some profiteering merchants from mixing dirty soil and pouring rice water and other unsanitary substances. In addition to the small amount produced by Jiuda Company, only the North China Chemical Industry Company produces a large amount of this kind of washing salt. As for the output of sodium sulfide, it accounts for 70% of the total output of Tianjin (Tianjin's production of sodium sulfide occupies an important position in the country), synthetic hydrochloric acid is the sole production, and caustic soda has also occupied a leading position.

　　华北化学工业公司简介
    华北人民政府为了加强华北化学工业的领导，将军管中国盐业公司华北分公司、军管天津化学工业公司、军管维新化学厂（包括军管德孚拜耳厂、军管汉沽大清工厂、军管汉沽维新厂）及军管石景山化工厂合并，组织华北化学工业公司，已于八月一日成立筹备处。它的任务是：１、迅速建立化学工业基础。２、计划发展化学重工业及基本化学工业。３、提高产品质量。４、研究恢复和发展化学工业过程中所需要解决的问题。５、配合化学工业整个的发展方向，经常作全面性的调查与研究工作（包括海洋工业、煤的加工工业、酸和人造肥料工业及其他重要化工原料工业）。目前华北化学工业公司筹备处所属的工厂计有：大沽三厂、汉沽一厂、汉沽二厂、天津三厂、维新化学厂。产品有漂白粉、固体烧碱、元明粉、石膏、氢氧化镁、骨胶、合成盐酸、氧化镁、脱胶骨粉、骨粉肥料、硫化青、硫化碱、再制盐、洗涤盐、生理食盐、硫酸镁及肥皂等。
    各厂自接管复工以来，产量已显著提高；质的方面，已达到解放前水平，且有更提高一步的。如大沽工厂的再制盐以往平均日产量为一·四八六六吨，现已增至七·九五吨；维新工厂的硫化青，平均日产量由○·二四吨增至一·二一七吨；硫化碱由○·六六六吨增至二·一四五二吨。天津工厂的骨胶平均日产量由○·五三二三吨增至一·五吨。汉沽一厂的漂白粉，以往仅有二六度，现已达到三○度；汉沽二厂的洗涤盐，亦较以往洁白粒大；维新工厂硫化青原为一百分，现已升到一○八·三分（此为平均数，个别最高的达一三三·三分）。该公司产品的制盐及硫化碱、烧碱、合成盐酸等占全国生产的重要地位。大沽工厂生产的再制盐，在我国尚属首创，品质可与美国所制之餐台用盐媲美。生理食盐，在外货缺乏的今日，已为极可宝贵的医药必需品。汉沽二厂用卤水冲洗的洗涤盐，洁白粒大，可免一部重视私利的商人，羼秽土，泼米面汤等不洁物。此种洗涤盐除久大公司生产少量外，只有华北化学工业公司大量的产制。至于硫化碱产量，占天津总产量百分之七十（天津硫化碱生产占全国重要地位），合成盐酸是独家生产，烧碱也已占领导地位了。
