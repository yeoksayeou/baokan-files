Tangshan Railway Factory
Neglects Worker Education, Seriously Reduces Output

[This newspaper reported] (This Dispatch) The leadership of the Tangshan Railway Factory lacked regular class education for its workers, resulting in tendencies of alternating enthusiasm and apathy in past production, which affected output. The factory has more than 4,900 workers and is the third largest railway machinery factory in the country. After the liberation of Tangshan, workers showed great enthusiasm for production during the "May 1st" labor campaign, with the April output reaching a record of 28 locomotives, 35 passenger cars, and 221 freight cars repaired. However, in May, production suddenly dropped to 10 locomotives, 26 passenger cars, and 169 freight cars repaired. Production in June, July, and August failed to return to the April standard. Before the April production competition, the leadership neither explained the significance of the competition to the workers, nor was there enough extra time to work, giving workers the illusion that "competition means creating records." Afterwards, they were busy judging results and holding meetings every day, encroaching on production time and neglecting to continue organizing and mobilizing workers for production. As a result, after "May 1st," morale plummeted. The merit evaluation was also unfair; some who worked really hard were not recognized. This was one aspect; another factor affecting workers' enthusiasm was the leadership's mechanical implementation of the "Three Originals" policy (original position, original salary, original organization), which allowed a few bad elements to continue riding roughshod over the workers. Workers were afraid to voice their opinions, and when they did, the leadership did not address them promptly. Later, some of the issues raised by workers were resolved, and a bad foreman named Li, who had been oppressing workers in the undercarriage assembly group, was also struggled against. Workers' morale soared. However, the opportunity to educate the staff was not seized, leaving some of them unsure of the Communist Party's policies and fearful of being "struggled against." Some young workers also did not truly understand the meaning of democracy, thinking that democracy meant no one could control them. They were sloppy during work hours and disregarded the advice of older workers. Some older workers were so angry that they stopped interfering. These reasons, directly and indirectly, affected production efficiency. Furthermore, the leadership lacked planning in production. This led to a phenomenon where workers manufacturing parts worked frantically at the beginning of the month, while assembly workers had nothing to do. At the end of the month, assembly workers rushed to create records, while parts manufacturing workers slackened off. This not only affected work efficiency but also product quality. Since the implementation of the machine responsibility system (responsible for use, management, and repair) in July, workers' morale has improved, and production enthusiasm has generally increased. However, due to a lack of planning in implementation, the task assigned by the Ministry of Railways has still not been completed. The responsibility system itself is a democratic system. How to implement the spirit of democratic management and regularly educate workers so that production can return to normal is the main direction of the factory's efforts in the future.

### 唐山铁路工厂　忽视职工教育产量严重降低

　　唐山铁路工厂
　  忽视职工教育产量严重降低
    【本报讯】唐山铁路工厂领导上对职工缺乏经常的进行阶级教育，致使在过去的生产中表现了冷热病的偏向，影响了生产。该厂拥有职工四千九百余人，为全国第三大铁路机厂，唐山解放后，职工在迎接“五一”的生产运动中，生产热情极高，四月份的生产量曾达到修复机车二十八台，客车三十五台，货车二百二十一台的纪录。但五月份就突然降低到修复机车十台，客车二十六台，货车一百六十九台。六、七、八月份仍未能恢复到四月份的标准。四月份生产竞赛前，领导上既未向职工说明竞赛的意义，加工时间又太多，使职工造成了“竞赛就是创造纪录”的错觉；事后又忙于评判成绩，天天开会，侵占了生产时间，忽略了继续组织发动职工生产。因此“五一”过去就泄了气。在评功中也作的不够公平，有些真正工作好的没评上，这是一方面；另一方面影响职工生产情绪的是领导上机械地执行三原不动政策（原职、原薪、原机构），使少数坏份子仍然骑在工人头上，工人有意见也不敢提出，有些提出了领导上也不及时解答。后来对工人所提的问题解决了一部分，又斗争了车底组欺压工人一个姓李的坏领班。工人情绪顿时高涨了。但是又没有抓住机会教育职员，使一部分职员对共产党的政策摸不着底，存在着怕“斗争自己”的顾虑。有些年青的工人也没有真正懂得民主的意义，以为民主就是谁都管不着了。在工作时间吊儿郎当，把老年工人的劝导不放在眼里，有的老年工人气的以后就不多管了。这些原因都直接间接的影响了生产效率。另外领导上对生产缺乏计划性。曾造成月初制造零件的工人拼命赶造，装配工人没活做。月底装配工人拼命突击造纪录，制件工人松懈下来的现象。不但影响工作效率，也影响了产品质量。该厂自七月份实行机器负责制后（包使、包管、包修），工人情绪好转，生产热情普遍提高。但因实行中缺乏计划性，仍没能完成铁道部给予的任务。负责制本身是一种民主制度，今后如何贯彻民主管理精神。经常向职工进行教育，以使生产走向正常，这是该厂今后主要努力方向。
