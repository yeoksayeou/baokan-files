Introducing "Million Soldiers Cross the Yangtze"
    Liu Nianqu
    Not only in the Chinese People's Liberation War, but also in all kinds of wars in the world, the victory of the Chinese People's Liberation Army in breaking through the natural barrier of the Yangtze River, advancing into the south of the Yangtze River, and liberating the entire Jinghu (Nanjing-Shanghai) line is a great achievement in the People's Liberation War. This victory marks the unprecedented growth and unparalleled strength of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, truly indestructible and invincible. This victory also demonstrates how the Chinese people have done their utmost to support the front lines in the revolutionary war to liberate themselves. This victory, this unprecedented great achievement, can now be seen in "Million Soldiers Cross the Yangtze."
    As a news documentary film, "Million Soldiers Cross the Yangtze" systematically narrates and reports the following process. In June 1947, with the help of American imperialism, the Chiang bandits launched a large-scale offensive against the Chinese people. The Chinese people rose up to defend themselves. After three years of arduous struggle, the Liberation Army finally defeated the enemy and reached the Yangtze River. In the spring of 1949, after the great victory of the Huaihai Campaign, all units of the Liberation Army immediately launched a surge to "cross the Yangtze River and liberate all of China"; the people in various parts of Jiangbei rose up to build bridges, roads, and send public grain, joyfully sending the army south. The Kuomintang reactionaries rejected the peace agreement proposed by the Communist Party of China. On April 21, Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu issued an order to advance. The million-strong army of the Liberation Army immediately arrived at various ports along the Yangtze River. On the nearly thousand-mile-long bank, artillery bombarded the south bank, covering the army crossing the Yangtze River in civilian boats, rushing through the huge waves, braving the enemy's artillery fire. In less than twenty minutes, our red flag was planted on the south bank. In less than twenty-four hours, we completely destroyed the enemy's thousand-mile river defense. Following this was the liberation of Nanjing, Suzhou, Hangzhou, and other important cities. The enemy's Second Fleet of the Navy revolted. The army was either captured or annihilated, and the defeated remnants fled south in panic. When various Liberation Army units approached the outskirts of Shanghai, the enemy frantically carried out a final round of sabotage, arrests, and massacres in the city. At this time, the Shanghai working class armed itself to protect the factories. Finally, after arduous battles, the enemy's three lines of defense were smashed, and Shanghai was liberated…
    All these scenes that we can see on the screen are the result of the arduous work of the twenty-three photographers and assistants of the nine photography teams dispatched to the front lines by the Beiping Film Studio (the materials for the eve of Shanghai's liberation were provided by the Shanghai Film and Drama Association Photography Group), working as hard as the commanders and fighters on the front line, and through editing, cutting, developing, printing, and recording... Because they heroically, diligently, and systematically carried out this task, they left a true, immortal, and glorious record of this great achievement. Due to the authenticity and artistry of the film, although there is no tortuous story, it still has a profound emotional impact, making the audience's heart beat in the same way as the hearts of the soldiers and working people on the screen, thereby further realizing that this is the people's own war, this is the people's victory, this is the great achievement of the wise leadership of the Communist Party of China—Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu! At the same time, we will have a stronger confidence: since we have already "crossed the Yangtze River", "liberating all of China" is not far away.

　　介绍“百万雄师下江南”
    刘念渠
    不仅是在中国人民解放战争中，就是在世界上所有的各种各样的战争中，中国人民解放军的突破长江天险，进军江南，解放京沪全线的胜利，是人民解放战争中的伟大战绩。这一胜利，标志着中国人民解放军的空前壮大与无比力量，确是无坚不摧，无敌不克的。这一胜利，也说明着中国人民如何在解放自身的革命战争中竭尽所能的大力支援前线。这一胜利，这一史无先例的伟大战绩，现在，我们可以在“百万雄师下江南”中看到了。
    做为一部新闻纪录电影的“百万雄师下江南”，系统的叙述了和报导了如下的经过。一九四七年六月，蒋匪在美帝国主义的帮助下，大规模向中国人民进攻。中国人民奋起自卫，经过三年的艰苦战斗，解放大军终于击败敌人，直抵长江。一九四九年春，淮海战役大胜利后，解放大军的各部，立即掀起了“打过长江去，解放全中国”的热潮；江北各地的人民风起云涌的修桥、筑路、送公粮，欢送大军南下。国民党反动派拒绝了中国共产党提出的和平协定，四月二十一日，毛主席和朱总司令发布了进军命令。解放军的百万雄师，立即开到长江各岸口，在长约千里的江岸上，大炮轰向南岸，掩护着以民船横渡长江的大军，冲过巨浪，冒着敌人的炮火，不到二十分钟，我们的红旗就插在南岸了，不到二十四小时，我们就全部摧毁了敌人的千里江防。跟着，是南京、苏州、杭州以及其他重要城市的解放，敌人的海军第二舰队起义了，陆军则被俘的被俘，被歼的被歼，败兵残卒狼狈向南溃退。各路解放军迫近上海近郊时候，敌人曾疯狂的在市区内进行最后一次的破坏、逮捕和屠杀；上海工人阶级在这时武装起来以保卫工厂。终于，经过艰苦的战斗，粉碎了敌人的三道防线，解放了上海………
    所有这些，我们可以在银幕上看到的每一个场面，都是北平电影制片厂派赴前线的九个摄影队二十三位摄影师和助手们，在火线上和指战员们一样的艰苦劳作（上海解放前夕的材料是由上海影剧协会摄影组供给的），并且，经过编辑、剪接、洗印、录音……而完成的。由于他们这样英勇的、辛勤的、有计划的执行了这一任务，就给这一伟大战绩留下了真实的、不朽的、光辉的纪录。由于影片所具有的真实性与艺术性，虽然没有什么曲折的故事，却同样的具有深刻的感动力，使观众的心和银幕上战士与劳动人民的心同样的在跳跃，从而更进一步的认识到这是人民自己的战争，这是人民的胜利，这是中国共产党——毛主席、朱总司令的英明领导的大成就！同时，我们也会有着更坚强的信心：既然已经“打过长江去”，“解放全中国”也就为期不远了。
