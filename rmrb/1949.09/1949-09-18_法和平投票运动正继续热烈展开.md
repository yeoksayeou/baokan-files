　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 17th: TASS, Paris: The French peace petition campaign is continuing. On the evening of September 13th, a working group from Paris placed ballot boxes at the entrance of an underground station to organize a peace petition among pedestrians. The police came to prohibit it, but in the twenty minutes before the police arrived, 4,362 votes in favor of peace had already been cast into the ballot boxes. The Renault factory management forbade the voting and threatened resisters with "severe sanctions," but the voting continued and achieved great success. On September 13th, a workers' delegation went to the management to declare that the workers could not tolerate any "sanctions" being imposed on those who participated in the peace petition. The peace petition campaign has also been vigorously launched in other cities.

　　法和平投票运动正继续热烈展开
    【新华社北平十七日电】塔斯社巴黎讯：法国和平投票运动正继续进行中，九月十三日晚，巴黎的工作组在一个地下车站的入口处放置投票箱，在行人中组织和平投票。警察赶来禁止，但就在警察赶到之前二十分钟内，就已有四千三百六十二张赞成和平的票投入了票箱。雷诺工厂经理部禁止投票并以采取“严厉制裁”威胁反抗者，然而投票仍然继续进行而且获得伟大成功。九月十三日工人代表团赴经理部宣告：工人们不能容忍对参加和平投票的人施行任何“制裁”。和平投票运动在其他城市亦已热烈展开。
