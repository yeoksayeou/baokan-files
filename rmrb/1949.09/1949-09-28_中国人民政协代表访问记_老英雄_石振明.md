　　A Visit with a Representative of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference
  　Old Hero – Shi Zhenming
    Yu Guang
    When you mention an old hero, almost everyone in the former Taiyue area knows him: Shi Zhenming.

    Shi Zhenming is a new farmer who suffered for four generations before finally achieving liberation. He is now a cadre working for the Farmers' Association in Fushan County. He is honest and simple, and very kind. Although he is already sixty years old, he is very strong and looks like he is only in his fifties.

    His ancestral home is Dangjiagang in Lin County, Henan Province. From the time he remembers his great-grandfather's generation, they were beggars. His grandfather and father worked as tenant farmers. He started working at the age of thirteen and was sent to a brick kiln to be an apprentice at sixteen, working there for sixteen years. In the ninth year of the Republic of China, the few acres of hillside land his family rented were forcibly taken back by the landlord, and because of a drought, they were forced to flee to Anze, Shanxi. Relying on begging, eating leaves and chaff, the couple reclaimed eleven acres of wasteland day and night. It was originally agreed that no rent would be collected for three years, but after the autumn harvest, the landlord insisted on collecting 1.5 *shi* of grain. Suing at the village office didn’t help. The rent rose year by year to 18 *shi*. They only harvested 20-30 *shi* of grain each year and after rent and taxes, they didn't have enough to eat or wear. He endured this for sixteen years. Later, he went to Nankongtan and Dongwanggou in Yangcheng to reclaim wasteland, but he was still bullied by the landlords and couldn't survive. In the 28th year of the Republic of China, he begged and fled to Xisongshan (where he now lives) in Fushan County to reclaim land. This was the early stage of the War of Resistance Against Japan. Japanese invaders, Chiang Kai-shek bandit stragglers, and local bandits occupied the area, often robbing livestock and grain, and killing chickens and pigs, adding another layer of disaster for the poor.

    The difficult days lasted for four or five years. Speaking of this, he suddenly said happily: "In the autumn of the 31st year of the Republic of China, the Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army came. We poor people have been liberated since then, stood up, no longer subject to oppression, can freely cultivate our own land, and no longer have to eat chaff."

    That winter, their village carried out an anti-corruption struggle. The following year, he joined the Farmers' Association and became a committee member. After that, he led the poor people in the village in struggles to reduce rent and interest and achieve reasonable burdens. Each of the more than two hundred members received seven or eight *dou* to more than one *shi* of grain.

    In the 33rd year of the Republic of China, the Great Production Movement was launched. He was the first to respond to the government's call, first finding acquaintances to form mutual aid teams, and at the same time promoting the benefits of mutual aid teams. He also took the lead in working for others. Gradually, the influence spread from his village to the people in Dong'ergou who also came to participate. That year, he led the whole village (including one hundred and five natural villages) to reclaim more than 400 *mu* of wasteland. In April, he was elected as a labor hero of the village and received a prize cow. Later, he was elected as a labor model in the county, district, and administrative office, and received two cows and 10,000 yuan. Everyone gave him a plaque. At the same time, he was elected as a county councilor. The name of the old hero spread throughout the entire border area. He himself became more enthusiastic, taking the lead and setting an example everywhere. His sincerity in serving the people made his prestige among the masses increase day by day. In the countryside, no matter what happened, as long as the old hero spoke, everyone was willing to do it. Their mutual aid team developed from six people in the village to a large labor exchange team of more than 1,000 people in five administrative villages by the 36th year of the Republic of China. Ninety percent of the male and female labor force were organized.

    In 1946, there was a hailstorm here, and only 20% of the crops survived. Everyone was worried and didn't know what to do, but the old hero led this work with great confidence. He called on everyone to produce and save for famine relief, organizing men to transport and sell goods, and women to spin and weave. He used the Zhang Meiying team of Houzhai Village as a specific example, calculating detailed accounts, and organized 25 people from autumn to winter. By the end of the year, they earned a total of 40 *shi* of corn, and each person got seven *jin* of salt. Not only did no one starve to death, but it ensured that the production of the following year was not affected. Everyone even ate meat for the New Year.

    The village he lives in used to have more than 320 households and over a thousand people, of which 270 households were tenant farmers. Most of the land was controlled by landlords, and the poor could not live. But since the Communist Party came, the village has completely changed. Now, everyone in the village has enough land, 290 large and small cattle, four or five carts, 400 spinning wheels, and 67 looms. On average, each person raises three chickens. Four out of five large villages have cooperatives. Every family can eat ten *jin* of meat during the New Year, and everyone has new clothes to wear.

    Talking about participating in the People's Political Consultative Conference, he smiled and said: "In the past, the landlords called us poor kids. Today, I can talk, shake hands, and eat with Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu. I am really honored." Then he said: "This meeting is well-held and very successful. We quickly united all democratic parties and all social strata in the country, and are quickly going to eliminate the remaining Chiang Kai-shek bandits. It is the hope of the people of the whole country."

    Finally, he stated: "I will definitely call on the people to cultivate intensively and meticulously, improve agricultural tools and seeds, plant more industrial raw materials, implement urban-rural mutual assistance, worker-peasant cooperation, and support the front lines when I return."

　　中国人民政协代表访问记
  　老英雄—石振明
    宇光
    一提起老英雄，前太岳区的人差不多都知道，他就是石振明。
    石振明是个受过四辈子苦翻了身的新农民，现在是浮山县农会工作干部。他淳厚朴实，待人非常亲切。虽然已经是六十岁的人了，但身体却非常健壮，看样子还不过五十几岁。
    他老家原是河南林县党家岗人，从他记得的曾祖父时代就讨饭，祖父、父亲给人家种地，他十三岁就参加劳动，十六岁被送到砖瓦窑去当学徒，一直干了十六年。到民国九年，他家租种的几亩山坡地，因被地主硬夺回不给种了，又加遭受旱灾，被逼没法才逃荒到山西安泽去了，靠着要饭，吃树叶和糠，夫妻两个人黑夜白天开了十一亩荒，本来讲好三年不收租，但秋后地主就非要一石五斗粮不给种，打官司到村公所也没人替他说话。租子随着一年年上涨到十八石，每年只打二、三十石粮，去了租税混不上吃穿，他一直忍受了十六年。以后到南孔滩、到阳城的东王沟去开荒，同样是受地主的欺负，不能活下去。到民国廿八年又要饭逃到浮山县西松山（即他现在住的地方）去开荒种地，这时是抗战初期，日寇和蒋匪散兵土匪盘踞境内，经常抢牲口粮食，杀鸡杀猪，给穷人又增加了一层灾难。
    苦难的日子一直熬了四五年，说到这他忽然很高兴地说：“民国三十一年秋共产党八路军来了，我们穷人从此就翻了身，站立起来，再也不受人的压迫，可以在自己的土地上自由耕种，再也不用吃糠了。”
    这年冬天他们村进行了反贪污斗争，第二年他参加了农会当了执委，以后就领导全村穷人进行减租减息合理负担斗争，二百多个会员每人都分到了七、八斗到一石多粮。
    民国三十三年开展大生产运动，他首先响应政府号召，先找自己的熟人成立互助组，一面又宣传互助组的好处，并且以身作则去先给别人干活，慢慢由本村影响到洞儿沟的人也来参加。这一年他领导全村（包括一百零五个自然村）共开荒四百多亩。四月间被选为本村劳动英雄得了一条奖牛，以后到县、分区、行署也都被选为劳动模范，得了两头牛和一万块钱，大家给他送了匾，同时又被选为县参议员，老英雄的名字从此传遍了全边区，他自己也更加起劲，处处带头起模范作用。他的为人民服务的赤诚使他在群众中的威信也一天天提高，在农村中不论有什么事，只要老英雄一说，大家就都愿意去照办。他们的互助组由本村六个人，到三十六年已发展成为五个行政村一千余人的大变工队了。百分之九十的男女劳动力都组织起来了。
    一九四六年这里闹雹灾，只有二成年景，大家都愁着没有办法，但老英雄却极有信心的去领导这一工作，他号召大家生产节约备荒组织男的运销，女的纺织，并用侯寨村张梅英小组作具体例子，算细帐等办法从秋到冬组织起二十五个人，到年底共挣了四十石玉蜀，每人七斤盐，不但没有饿死人，保证了第二年的生产不受影响，过年大家还吃上了肉。
    他住的村过去有三百二十几户，千余口人，其中有二百七十户是佃农，土地大部掌握在地主手中，穷人不能生活。可是自从来了共产党，这个村就完全变了样，现在他们村每人都有了足够的土地，大小牛二百九十头，四、五辆大车，四百辆纺车，六十七台织布机，平均每人养三只鸡。五个大村有四个合作社，家家过年可吃十来斤肉，人人都有了新衣穿。
    谈到参加人民政协的事，他笑着说：“过去地主叫咱穷小子，今天咱能和毛主席、朱总司令一齐谈话握手吃饭了，我真光荣。”接着又说：“这个会开的好，很顺利，我们把全国各民主党派、各阶层很快团结在一起，快去消灭残余蒋匪，是全国人民的希望。”
    最后他表示：“我回去定号召老百姓精耕细作，改良农具和种籽，多种工业原料，实行城乡互助，工农合作，支援前线。”
