　　Wishing Robeson to Sing More Bravely
    American black singer Paul Robeson is a singer beloved by people all over the world because his singing is a battle call to all progressive mankind. His singing, being loved by the people, is naturally hated by the fascists. On the 27th of last month, fascist thugs, with the connivance of the US government, carried out a hooligan-like attack on the Robeson concert held in Peekskill. This is not surprising at all.
    However, the American people were not intimidated by this atrocity. Progressive people across the United States unanimously issued a fierce condemnation of this atrocity. Robeson also declared after the incident: "I will go to Peekskill again and hold concerts all over the United States!" Sure enough, on the evening of the 31st, Robeson held another concert in the same place. Robeson's singing overwhelmed all the fascist noise and disturbances outside and in the air, winning the praise of 25,000 listeners, rendering the enemy's dry horns and empty drums useless.
    In a letter to Mr. Robeson a few days ago, the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Chinese Musicians Association strongly protested against the atrocities of the American reactionaries and welcomed him to come to New China. Yes, our Chinese people have always loved the people's singers. In all our liberated areas, the songs of New China are fluttering everywhere. We welcome the songs of the American people resisting tyranny to be sung together on both sides of the Pacific. No reactionaries can stop our chorus! We would like to wish Robeson and countless peace-loving and freedom-loving American people and their singers to sing more bravely and loudly! Let the war-mongers of Wall Street tremble in the darkroom!

　　祝罗伯逊更勇敢地高唱
    美国黑人歌唱家罗伯逊，是全世界人民所敬爱的歌手，因为他的歌声，是向全体进步人类发出的战斗号召。他的歌声，既为人民所喜爱，当然也就为法西斯所忌恨。上月二十七日，法西斯暴徒们，在美政府纵容下，向在毕克斯吉尔举行的罗伯逊音乐会实行流氓式的袭击，这是毫不足奇的。
    不过，美国人民并没有为这种暴行所吓倒，全美各地进步人士对此暴行一致发出猛烈谴责，罗伯逊亦于事后宣称：“我还要到毕克斯吉尔去，到美国各地举行音乐会！”果然，三十一号晚间，罗伯逊又在原地举行音乐会了。罗伯逊的歌声压倒了一切场外及上空法西斯的嘈杂与喧扰，赢得了二万五千听众的赞扬，使敌人枯燥的喇叭，空洞的大鼓失去作用。
    我全国文联及音协于日前电慰罗氏的书信中，强烈抗议美国反动派的暴行，并欢迎他到新中国来。是的，我们中国人民一向喜爱人民的歌手。在我们所有解放了的地区里，新中国的歌声到处在飘扬，我们欢迎和美国人民反抗暴政的歌声在太平洋两岸合唱在一起，没有任何反动派能阻止住我们这种合唱！我们谨祝罗伯逊和无数爱和平爱自由的美国人民及其歌手们更勇敢更高声地唱起来！让华尔街的战争贩子们在暗室里发抖吧！
