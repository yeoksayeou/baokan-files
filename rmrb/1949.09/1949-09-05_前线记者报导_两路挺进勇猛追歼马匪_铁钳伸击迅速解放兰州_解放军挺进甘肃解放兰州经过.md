  　Two Routes Advance, Valiantly Pursuing and Annihilating Bandit Troops; Iron Pincers Extend, Rapidly Liberating Lanzhou;
    The People's Liberation Army's Advance into Gansu and the Liberation of Lanzhou

    [Xinhua News Agency, Northwest Front, 4th] A frontline reporter reports on the People's Liberation Army's advance into Gansu and the battle to liberate Lanzhou, stating: The People's Liberation Army, with hundreds of thousands of troops and an overwhelming momentum, fiercely pursued the "Two Ma" bandit troops for over 1,400 *li*, rapidly liberating Lanzhou and more than twenty county towns in eastern and southern Gansu, and annihilating a large part of the elite of the Ma bandit army. This was a large-scale pursuit. The People's Liberation Army advanced into Gansu from Guanzhong in two routes: the southern route successively captured Long County, Tianshui, and Lintao; the northern route rapidly broke through the three lines of defense of the Ma bandits at Gugu Pass, Pingliang, and the Liupan Mountains, liberating Longde, Huining, and Dingxi, like a powerful pair of iron pincers extending towards Lanzhou, the ruling center of the Northwest bandit gang.

    In the relentless pursuit, day and night, the People's Liberation Army overcame the various significant difficulties caused by the high mountains of the Northwest Plateau, the continental climate, and the vast land with sparse population. A certain regiment of the People's Liberation Army, pursuing the Ning Ma bandit army north from Pingliang, once had soldiers who each ate only one mountain yam before pursuing for a hundred *li*. Another regiment, on one occasion, each only drank some thin porridge before marching dozens of *li* through mountains and valleys at night. A unit encountered fierce winds and torrential rain during a battle; hailstones broke the soldiers' straw hats, rainwater filled the barrels of their 60mm mortars, and flash floods swept some soldiers off their feet, but they immediately got up and continued forward. A regiment once camped in a small village with only nineteen households, with most people camping outside, two people sharing a thin quilt to resist the nocturnal attacks of the cold winds of the plateau. In the hot and water-scarce conditions, all the soldiers remained without complaint, bravely advancing. When a unit was fiercely pursuing the Ma bandits in Lingtai, some soldiers were so thirsty that they almost fainted, but under the heroic slogan "Overcoming difficulties is victory, catching up with the enemy is victory, advancing one *li* is one *li* of victory," they continued to pursue and advance. On August 12th, the northern route of the westward advancing People's Liberation Army reached the Huajia Ridge, which was over 2,000 meters above sea level and 230 *li* long. The mountain was sparsely populated and lacked food and drink. The soldiers were fearless, filling their dry food bags with steamed buns, and their water bottles, iron cans, marching pots, and ammunition boxes were all filled with water, carrying them on their backs, shoulders, and by lifting them, as they crossed this great mountain.

    Launch Physical Assistance Movement to Overcome Difficulties and Victoriously Advance

    In order to overcome difficulties and victoriously complete the task of advancing, all commanders and fighters launched a physical assistance movement. Soldiers Li Tong, Cao Shulin, and others from a certain regiment helped each other carry heavy machine guns, each weighing over 60 *jin*, adding to their own clothing and food, each person bearing a weight of over 100 *jin*. Since the westward advance, Pang Laizhen, the company commander of the 4th Company of the 2nd Battalion of a certain regiment, had been helping the soldiers carry things, never letting his shoulders be without a machine gun or 60mm mortar shells for a single day. Xing Xiting, the political instructor of the company, always followed the sick soldiers during the march, either supporting them or sometimes carrying them on his back.

    In this way, the People's Liberation Army overcame all difficulties and rapidly and bravely advanced to the city of Lanzhou.

    When the northern route of the People's Liberation Army advancing westward along the Xi'an-Lanzhou Highway reached an area twenty *li* east of Lanzhou, the Ma bandits attempted to make a last-ditch struggle relying on the so-called "Ma Family Mountain Defense Works." This line of defense was naturally defended by the Yellow River to the left, and a bare high mountain ran across the north and south. When Zhu Shaoliang, the bandit chief, was the chairman of bandit Gansu Province, he built a dangerous defensive work based on the mountain's terrain, with steep, precipitous walls from the foot of the mountain to the top, and a dense network of communication trenches. On the morning of August 25th, the People's Liberation Army began its attack with fierce artillery fire. For a time, field guns and howitzers shook the mountains and rivers, and shells exploded in the enemy's fortifications like a rainstorm. The infantry, under the cover of artillery, launched a fierce attack in two routes. The heroes attacking on the right route braved the enemy's fire and climbed to the top of the mountain in ten minutes, quickly occupying important positions on the hilltop and repelling several desperate counterattacks by the enemy. After dusk, a unit responsible for the left-wing attack also occupied the entire summit of the highest and sharpest Gu Zhang Ridge, victoriously and completely occupying all the Ma Family Mountain fortifications of the Ma bandits, and continuously pursued and fiercely attacked, reaching directly under the city of Lanzhou, and victoriously joining forces with the People's Liberation Army that had captured Tianshui and Lintao and advanced westward.

    On the 25th, our army launched a fierce attack on the Ma bandits' positions on Shenjia Ridge, Gouwa Mountain, Yingpan Mountain, and Doujia Mountain south of Lanzhou City, fighting fiercely all day, defeating dozens of desperate counterattacks by the stubborn enemy, and annihilating more than 6,000 enemy soldiers. By 6 p.m., it had successively captured important positions such as Shenjia Ridge, Gouwa Mountain, Yingpan Mountain, and Doujia Mountain. As a result, the Ma bandits completely collapsed and retreated westward in a panic, attempting to cross the Yellow River to the north and escape. Our army immediately pursued the enemy in several routes, and a unit of our army ambushed in the Qilihe area west of the city also immediately joined the battle. One route crossed Xiguan, rushed to seize the Yellow River Iron Bridge, fiercely pursued and intercepted the fleeing Ma bandits, another route pounced on Xiguan Street, continuing to develop in depth along the street, and another route followed the northern city wall, developing eastward along the Yellow River.

    A unit of the People's Liberation Army that crossed Xiguan and rushed along the main road to the Yellow River Iron Bridge formed a sharp knife assault team while fiercely pursuing the fleeing bandits, using fierce firepower to defeat the enemy's blocking and quickly open a bloody path through the enemy, inserting themselves to the bridgehead. At this time, the enemy had swarmed to the north bank to escape, with people, horses, carts, cars, and supplies squeezed into a ball at the bridgehead. Xu Shiku, the company commander of a certain company of our army, immediately organized all the firepower and suddenly launched a fierce attack on the escaping enemy on the bridge and at the bridgehead. The bridge was immediately controlled by our firepower. Under the dense network of fire, the escaping enemy fell on their backs and horses, mixed into a ball, and countless people drowned in the river. This route of our army quickly occupied the bridge and in one fell swoop seized the Tasha Mountain position on the north bank of the Yellow River. At this point, the retreat route of the bandit army in Lanzhou City was completely cut off by us, ensuring the victorious completion of the annihilation battle.

    At this time, the defending enemy in Lanzhou had lost their composure. Our assault team quickly climbed the city tower and completely liberated Lanzhou at 7:00 a.m. on the 26th. Except for parts of the 150th Division of the 92nd Army, the 181st Division of the 129th Army, and the 357th Division of the Ma bandits that escaped, the most elite 100th Division and 248th Division of the 82nd Army of the Qing Ma bandits, the 1st Security Regiment of Qinghai, and all of the 1st and 4th Security Regiments of Gansu, as well as parts of the 150th, 181st, and 357th Divisions, were mostly annihilated by us.

  　两路挺进勇猛追歼马匪  铁钳伸击迅速解放兰州　
    解放军挺进甘肃解放兰州经过
    【新华社西北前线四日电】前线记者报导人民解放军挺进甘肃解放兰州的作战经过称：人民解放军数十万大军以排山倒海之势，猛追二马匪军一千四百余里，迅速解放兰州及陇东陇南县城廿余座、歼灭马匪军精锐大部，这是大规模的追击。解放军系分两路自关中向甘肃挺进：南路连克陇县、天水、临洮，北路迅速突破马匪固关、平凉及六盘山三道防线，解放隆德、会宁、定西，象一把有力的铁钳伸向西北匪帮的统治中心兰州。
    解放军在不分昼夜的猛追中，曾经克服了西北高原的高山、大陆性气候和地广人稀所造成的种种重大困难。自平凉北追宁马匪军的某部解放军某团，某次每个战士只吃了一个山药蛋，追击了一百里；另外一个团某次每人只喝了点稀饭，即在夜间爬山越岭行军数十里。某部在战斗途中曾逢狂风暴雨，冰雹把战士们的草帽都打破了，雨水灌满了六零炮筒，山洪暴发，有的战士被冲倒，但立刻又爬起来继续前进。某部一个团有一次在一个只有十九户人家的小村上宿营，大部分人在外面露营，两人伙盖一床夹被，抵御高原寒风的夜袭。在炎热缺水的情况下，所有战士仍然毫无怨言，奋勇前进。某部在灵台猛追马匪时，有的战士渴得几乎晕倒，但他们在“克服困难就是胜利，追上敌人就是胜利，前进一里胜利一里”的英雄口号号召下，仍然继续追击前进。八月十二日，北路西进解放军到达拔海二千多公尺长达二百三十里的华家岭，山上人烟稀少，缺吃缺喝，战士们毫无畏色，几万人把干粮袋都装满了馒头，水壶、铁筒、行军锅、子弹箱统统都装满了水，背着、扛着、抬着，越过了这座大山。
    展开体力互助运动克服困难胜利进军
    为了克服困难，胜利完成进军的任务，全体指挥员战斗员都展开了体力互助运动。某团战士李同、曹树林等五人互相帮助扛重机枪，每一件都超过六十斤，加上他们自己的服装、粮食，每人负担重量均在一百斤以上。某团二营四连连长庞来珍在西进以来，一直帮着战士们扛东西，没有一天肩膀上离开过机关枪或六零炮弹。该连政治指导员邢喜庭在行军中始终跟着病号走，或扶着病号走，有时还背着病号走。
    就这样，解放军克服了一切困难，迅速勇猛地进抵兰州城下。
    当北路沿西兰公路西进的解放军进抵兰州以东二十里地区时，马匪曾企图凭借所谓“马家山国防工事”做垂死的挣扎。这一条防线左依黄河天险，南北横亘着一条光秃秃的高山。朱匪绍良任匪甘肃省主席时，即依山势筑成了一条险要的防御工事，从山麓直到山巅，砌成陡悬的削壁，交通壕密如蛛网。八月二十五日上午，解放军以猛烈炮火开始攻击，一时野炮、榴弹炮震撼河山，炮弹象暴雨似的在敌人工事里爆炸。步兵在炮兵掩护下分两路猛攻。右路攻击的英雄们冒敌人炮火十分钟即攀登到山巅，迅速占领了山头重要阵地，并击溃了敌人几次绝望的反扑。黄昏后，担任左路攻击的某部亦占领了整个山巅最高尖的古丈岭，胜利地完全占领了马匪的马家山全部工事，并连续猛追猛打，直抵兰州城下，与连克天水、临洮西进的解放军胜利会师。
    二十五日，我军向兰州城南沈家岭、狗娃山、营盘山及窦家山等马匪阵地猛攻，激战终日，打垮了顽敌数十次的拼死反扑，歼敌六千余人，至下午六时，先后攻占沈家岭、狗娃山、营盘山、窦家山诸重要阵地。于是马匪全部崩溃，狼狈向城西溃退，企图北渡黄河夺路而逃。我军当即分数路追击敌人，我预伏于城西七里河地区某部亦立刻投入战斗。一路越西关，抢占黄河大铁桥猛追并截击西逃马匪，一路猛扑西关大街，顺大街继续向纵深发展，一路顺北城墙，沿黄河向东发展。
    越西关顺大路扑向黄河铁桥的解放军某部，在猛追逃匪时组成了一支尖刀突击队，以猛烈的火力击溃了敌人的阻击，并迅速从敌人中间打开一条血路，插到桥头。这时敌人已蜂涌向北岸逃命，人马、大车、汽车、辎重在桥头挤做一团。我某连连长许世奎立刻组织了所有的火力，突然对桥上及桥头逃敌展开了猛烈射击。该桥当即为我火力控制。在密集的火网下，逃敌人仰马翻，混成一团，溺毙河中者不计其数。该路我军迅速占领大桥后，并一举强占黄河北岸塔山阵地。至此，兰州城匪军的退路，被我完全截断，保证了歼灭战的胜利完成。
    此时，兰州守敌已手足失措，我攻城队迅速登上城楼并于二十六日晨七时，完全解放兰州。马匪除九十二军一五○师、一二九军一八一师及三五七师各一部逃跑外，青马匪军最精锐的八十二军一百师、二四八师，青海保安第一团，甘肃保安第一团，第四团等全部及一五○师、一八一师、三五七师一部，大部被我消灭。
