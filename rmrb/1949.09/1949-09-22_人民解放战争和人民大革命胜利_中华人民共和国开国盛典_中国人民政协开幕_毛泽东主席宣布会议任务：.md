All the delegates stood up and applauded enthusiastically for as long as five minutes.

Chairman Mao Zedong's opening speech vividly and succinctly described the historical conditions and historical tasks for convening the conference.

Chairman Mao Zedong's persuasive and optimistic speech evoked thunderous applause from the audience almost every sentence.

After Chairman Mao Zedong's opening speech ended in prolonged applause, the entire audience stood up and observed three minutes of silence in mourning for the people's heroes who sacrificed themselves in the People's Liberation War and the People's Revolution.

The speeches of the twelve speakers were all warmly welcomed with applause from the audience. They represent all aspects of the new China's forces, illustrating the common belief in the bright future of the new China.

Due to the unfortunate death of General Yang Jie, a delegate to the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, today's meeting adopted the temporary motion of the delegation of the Communist Party of China, and the presidium, in the name of the conference, sent condolences to the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang and the family of General Yang Jie.

The executive chairmen of today's meeting were Mao Zedong, Zhu De, Li Jishen, Shen Junru, and Guo Moruo. The arrangement on the rostrum was simple and beautiful. On the front of the rostrum were hung portraits of Chinese revolutionary leaders Sun Yat-sen and Mao Zedong, and in the middle and on both sides were hung the emblem of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and the military flag of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. The rest room of the venue was filled with congratulatory banners and pennants from national people's organizations, troops, and regions.
