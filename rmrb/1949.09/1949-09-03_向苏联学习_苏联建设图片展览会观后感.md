　　Learning from the Soviet Union
  　Reflections on Viewing the Soviet Construction Photo Exhibition
    Liu Nianqu
    As is well known, under the fascist dark rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, we not only lacked the possibility and freedom to have a true, correct, and comprehensive understanding of socialist Soviet Union, but were also frequently deceived by the reactionaries' self-deceiving and malicious propaganda. Among the liberal individuals I knew, the idea of equating the Soviet Union with American imperialism was not limited to just one or two people. Only today, when the people's democratic revolution has achieved basic victory and established a people's regime, do we have this possibility and freedom. Thanks to the efforts of the preparatory committee of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association and the assistance of the Soviet Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, most people have, almost for the first time, had the opportunity to recognize and understand the true situation of Soviet construction from the photographs, and to further understand what kind of new country the Soviet Union is.

    Generally speaking, the materials provided by this Soviet Construction Photo Exhibition can be described as systematically, comprehensively, and completely introducing the Soviet Union. A serious visitor would have to spend a full three or four hours to carefully examine everything. If one can examine it carefully, it is not difficult to understand that after thirty-two years of arduous struggle, the transformation from backward Tsarist Russia to socialist Soviet Union has brought about leap-forward progress in all aspects of the economy, politics, military, culture, and people's lives. The standards reached in all aspects exceed those before the Patriotic War and surpass those of the highly developed capitalist United States. This unprecedented improvement is not accidental; the leadership of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), the guidance of Stalin, and the united struggle of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) members, non-Party Bolsheviks, and the broad Soviet people (workers, peasants, and intellectuals) are indispensable. Especially today, with the Soviet Union at the head of the camp of peace and democracy on one side, and American imperialism at the head of the camp of war and fascism on the other, we are inevitably leaning to one side and must lean to the side of peace and democracy. We are happy to see the post-war economic recovery and development of the Soviet Union, the "powerful fortress of international security" (Tikhonov), and progress in other areas. Perhaps with envy, perhaps with admiration, perhaps with the mentality of "let's compare," many visitors sincerely smiled with joy in front of the photographs of the Soviet people. If the people in the photographs were alive, we would see warm handshakes and embraces.

    It is precisely the photographs of the heroic, healthy, and joyful Soviet people in front of us, from Stalin to children in nurseries, that cannot help but remind us of the situation thirty years ago. According to books (reliable books), in the first year or two after the October Revolution: even Lenin himself had to share an eighth of a pound of bread each day, and most workers could be said to have been constantly enduring hunger; the harsh Treaty of Brest-Litovsk had to be accepted; four years of arduous struggle were continuously waged against the joint forces of the armed interventionists of Britain, France, Japan, and Poland, and the counter-revolutionary factions of the Russian bourgeois landlords, and their attacks were finally crushed; constant struggles were waged against various secret saboteurs and foreign spies; and a high tide of socialist competition was launched in the implementation of the First Five-Year Plan, breaking the world's labor productivity records; the most difficult days were spent in the first stage of the Patriotic War, and thanks to the heroic perseverance and willingness to sacrifice of the Soviet people (the exhibition includes photographs of Saburov and Zoya from "Days and Nights"), the Hitler bandits were finally defeated. ... We should understand that without all this, there could be no high achievements represented by the photographs in the exhibition. That is to say, the situation we see in the photographs today, no matter how great or how minute, is all the result of thirty-two years of arduous struggle.

    Chairman Mao taught us that China will, under the leadership of the working class and the Communist Party, steadily advance from an agricultural country to an industrial country, and from a new democratic society to a socialist and communist society. At the same time, Chairman Mao also taught us: "The All-Union Communist Party is our best teacher, and we must learn from the All-Union Communist Party." There are many subjects to learn, and the aforementioned experience of thirty-two years of struggle will be the most important lesson. The Soviet Construction Photo Exhibition, in this sense, is the first hour of this lesson. We cannot predict how many hours or school years it will take to complete this lesson. As the All-Union Communist Party will continue to struggle, our learning will be a lifelong matter. For the broad masses of the people, everyone should also learn from the Soviet people, learning how, under the leadership of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)—Lenin and Stalin—they heroically persevered, were willing to sacrifice, endured all suffering, and promoted a high spirit of labor, wholeheartedly striving in their own posts to build a socialist country, in order to build our new China of the people's democratic dictatorship under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party—Chairman Mao—in the next ten, twenty, thirty... years.

### 向苏联学习　苏联建设图片展览会观后感

　　向苏联学习
  　苏联建设图片展览会观后感
    刘念渠
    如所周知，在国民党反动派的法西斯黑暗统治之下，我们不仅没有真实的、正确的、全面的认识与了解社会主义底苏联的可能与自由，而且，经常地被反动派自欺欺人的恶意宣传所蒙蔽，在我所知道的自由主义的人士之间，把苏联与美帝国主义同等看待的念头，并非仅仅一二人所有。只有在人民民主革命已经获得了基本的胜利并建立了人民政权的今天，我们才有这种可能与自由。由于中苏友好协会筹备委员会的努力，由于苏联对外文化协会的帮助，大多数的人们才几乎是初次地得到这样的一个机会：从图片上认识与了解到苏联建设的真实情况，进而认识与了解到苏联是怎样的一个新国家。
    一般说来，这次苏联建设图片展览会所提供的材料，是称得起系统的、概括的、完备的介绍了。在一个认真的参观者，得花去整整三个或四个钟头，才能逐一的看个仔细。如果能够看个仔细，就不难明白：经过了三十二年的艰苦战斗，从落后的沙皇俄国，进到社会主义的苏联，在经济、政治、军事、文化与人民生活各个方面，都有着飞跃的进步。各方面所达到的水准，超过了卫国战争之前，超过了资本主义高度发展的美国。这种空前提高，不是偶然的，联共（布）的领导，斯大林的指导，联共（布）党员、非党的布尔什维克、广大的苏联人民（工人、农民与知识分子）的团结战斗，可以说是缺一不可的。特别是在今天，一边是以苏联为首的和平与民主的阵营，一边是以美帝为首的战争与法西斯的阵营，我们既必然的一面倒而且必然地倒在和平与民主这一边，我们乐意看见“国际安全的强有力的堡垒”（吉洪诺夫）的苏联的战后的经济恢复与发展及其他各方面的进步。也许是怀有羡慕，也许是怀有钦佩，也许是怀有“让我们来比比”的心理，多少参观者在苏联人照像面前由衷的欢喜的微笑着。假如对方是活生生的人，我们就会看见热烈的握手与拥抱了。
    恰是面前的英勇、健康与愉快的苏联人的照像，从斯大林到托儿所里的小孩，不能不使我们想到三十年前的情形。据书本（可靠的书本）告诉我们，在十月革命后的第一、二年中：是连列宁也每天得分到八分之一磅的面包，大多数的工人可以说是经常要忍着饥饿的；是不得不接受苛刻的布列斯特和约（对德和约）的；是连续进行了四年的对英、法、日、波武装干涉者与俄国资产阶级地主白卫军反革命派联合势力的艰苦战斗，终于粉碎了他们的进攻的；是不断的与各种隐秘的破坏分子与外国奸细进行斗争的；是在实施第一个五年计划中展开了社会主义竞赛的高潮，打破了全世界的劳动生产率纪录的；是在卫国战争第一阶段中渡过最艰苦的日子，靠了苏联人的英勇坚持与不惜牺牲（在展览的图片中就有“日日夜夜”中的萨布洛夫与卓娅）终于战胜了希特勒匪徒的。……我们应该明白：没有这一切，就不可能有展览的图片所表示的高度成就。这就是说，我们今天在图片上所看见的情况，无论它是多么伟大的或多么细微的，无一不是因三十二年的艰苦战斗才有的收获。
    毛主席教导我们：中国将在工人阶级及共产党领导之下稳步地由农业国进到工业国，由新民主主义社会进到社会主义社会与共产主义社会。同时，毛主席又教导我们：“联共就是我们最好的先生，我们必须向联共学习。”学习的课目有很多，前面随便提及的三十二年的斗争经验，将是最主要的一课。苏联建设图片展览，在这意义之下，乃是这一课的最初的一小时。我们不能预计这一课要多少小时或几学年才能读完，由于联共仍将继续斗争下去，我们的学习，就会是整整一辈子的事情。对于广大的人民说，人人还应该向苏联人民学习，学习他们如何在联共（布）——列宁、斯大林的领导下，英勇坚持、不惜牺牲、忍受一切痛苦、发扬高度的劳动精神，全心全意地在自己的岗位上为建设社会主义国家而奋斗的精神与作风，以期在今后的十年、二十年、三十年……之内，在中国共产党——毛主席的领导下，建设我们的人民民主专政的新中国。
