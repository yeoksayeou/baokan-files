Selling Her Son
　　New District Song No. 1
　　Zhen Chongde
　　(I)
　　There's Hou Village in Datong,
　　Hou Village has a mother who sold her son;
　　It's not that the mother doesn't love her child,
　　It's not that the mother is evil-hearted.
　　The walls of Datong city circle and turn,
　　The mother's grievances are endless:
　　First cursing the damned Yan Xishan,
　　Drafting soldiers and grabbing men to fight the civil war,
　　A rope, a gun,
　　Her husband dragged into the defense corps,
　　Two eyes flowing dry with tears.
　　Today a levy, tomorrow a donation,
　　The harvest comes in but is never seen;
　　Unable to pay the rent,
　　The landlord is black-hearted,
　　Two measures of rent turned his eyes red,
　　A piece of paper, a pen,
　　A calculation with the abacus,
　　Forcing a mother to sell her son!
　　How could a mother bear to part with her own child?
　　How could a child bear to leave his mother's embrace?
　　The child's tears,
　　Pierced the mother's heart;
　　The child's cries,
　　Scattered the mother's soul.
　　Lying down, unable to sleep peacefully;
　　Sitting up, her heart in turmoil;
　　Reaching out, her hands tremble;
　　Holding him, it's an empty embrace;
　　Closing her eyes, she sees her child;
　　Opening her eyes, the child is gone.
　　She doesn't feel hunger in her belly;
　　She doesn't feel cold on her body;
　　Wanting to commit suicide,
　　Her heart is burdened by the child!
　　Wanting to go and see the child,
　　Hateful high walls and deep courtyards,
　　A yellow dog squats before the gate,
　　How could the landlord allow a visit?
　　Blue sky, yellow sky, old blue sky,
　　You who are killing this mother, which sky are you?

　　(II)
　　A cannon blast,
　　The life-saving Communist Party arrived,
　　Iron walls surrounding city walls,
　　The enemy in Datong surrendered!
　　The Communist Party brought good troops,
　　Good troops liberated Hou Village;
　　Hou Village established a good government,
　　The good government rescued Mother Hou,
　　Mother Hou changed out of her old clothes and put on new ones!
　　Her face is joyful and she is full of energy.
　　Embracing her own child,
　　Tears welling up in her smiling eyes,
　　Word by word,
　　She tells her loved one who has returned from liberation:
　　"Our suffering, our grievances,
　　In the past, who could we tell our grievances to?
　　The child's father,
　　Just mentioning him makes my heart ache!
　　We suffered in the soil, we were harmed in the soil;
　　We scratched for food from the soil, we faced disaster in the soil;
　　The grain we planted, the cotton we harvested,
　　What we ate and wore,
　　Both hands empty, never seeing them!
　　For a year, we didn't eat a single bowl of thick rice porridge.
　　For half a lifetime, we couldn't wear a single new garment.
　　In the end,
　　The land was seized, not even half a furrow left,
　　The house was used to pay rent, not even half a room left;
　　A gun barrel,
　　Bound and took you away;
　　A calculation with the abacus,
　　Forced us to give up our child.
　　As the saying goes: a person who shouldn't die will be saved,
　　The life-saving living immortals have come.
　　This debt of vengeance can finally be settled!
　　We didn't have land, now they're dividing land for us;
　　We didn't have a place to live, now they're dividing houses for us;
　　I want to see my loved one, and we can meet;
　　I want my child, and I can hold him in my arms again!
　　With such good times, we don't need to fear not living well,
　　We only fear that the roots of bitterness won't be completely dug up.
　　The bitterness, the sourness,
　　The Communist Party has removed them all for us;
　　What was lacking, what was missing,
　　The Communist Party has given it to us.
　　You quickly go to the front lines, to kill the bandit Chiang;
　　I will stay at home, busy with production."
　　(September in Datong)

　　卖儿娘
　  新区歌之一
    甄崇德
　　（一）
　  大同有个侯大庄，
    侯大庄有个卖儿娘；
    不是为娘不疼儿，
    不是为娘坏心肠。
　  大同城墙团团转，
    娘的冤曲说不完：
    先骂灰鬼阎锡山，
    抽兵抓丁打内战，
    绳子一条，枪一杆，
    丈夫抓进保卫团，
    两眶眼泪流个干。
　  今天款，明天捐，
    庄稼上场不见面；
    租子交不上，
    地主黑心肝，
    二斗租子红了眼，
    纸一张，笔一杆，
    一盘算子，
    逼个亲娘把儿卖！
    亲娘怎舍亲生孩？
    孩儿怎舍亲娘怀？
    孩的眼泪，
    把娘的心滴穿；
    孩的哭声，
    把娘的魂哭散。
　  躺下来，睡不安；
    坐起来，心里乱；
    摸一把，两手颤；
    抱一抱，是空怀；
    闭眼，看见孩；
    睁眼，孩不见。
　  肚里不知饿；
    身上不觉寒；
    有意寻短见，
    心上结记孩！
    有心上前把孩见，
    可恨高墙深院
    黄狗蹲门前，
    地主那容见？
　  青天、黄天、老蓝天，
    杀娘的，你是那个天？
　　（二）
　  一声炮响，
    来了救命的共产党，
    铁墙套城墙，
    大同的敌人投了降！
　  共产党领来了好军队，
    好军队解放了侯大庄；
    侯大庄建立了好政权，
    好政权救出了侯大娘，
    侯大娘换下旧衣穿新衣！
    脸上喜来人精神。
    怀抱亲生儿，
    笑眼里噙着泪花花，
    一句一句，
    对着解放回来的亲人儿讲：
　 “咱的苦，咱的冤，
    过去的冤苦对谁谈？
    孩的爹呀，
    提起心里酸！
    咱土里受苦，土里害；
    咱土里刨食，土里灾；
    种的谷，收的棉，
    吃的、穿的，
    两手空空，不见面！
    一年没吃过一顿稠米粥。
    半辈子穿不上一件新衣衫。
    到后来，
    土地抢去没半垄，
    房子顶租没半间；
    一枝枪杆，
    绑走个你；
    一盘算子，
    逼去咱的孩。
　  常言说：人不该死，有人救，
    来了救命的活神仙。
    这笔冤仇才得算！
    咱没种来，分咱地；
    咱没住来，分咱房；
    我要亲人，人见面；
    我讨孩儿，孩儿重新抱在怀！
    好光景，还怕过不好，
    苦根子，只怕挖不完。
    苦的，酸的，
    共产党给咱除了个净；
    缺的，少的，
    共产党给了咱。
    你快上前线，杀蒋贼；
    我在家里，忙生产。
    （九月于大同）
