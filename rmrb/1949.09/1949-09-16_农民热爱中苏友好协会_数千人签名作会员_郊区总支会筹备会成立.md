　　Farmers Love the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association
　  Thousands Sign Up as Members
　  Suburban General Branch Preparatory Committee Established
    [Reported by this newspaper] The Preparatory Committee of the Beijing Suburban General Branch of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association was established on the 14th, with Chai Zemin and others serving as members of the preparatory committee. Since Comrade Peng Zhen's report at the concert hall on August 21st,座谈会have been held in various suburbs for farmers, workers, and teachers to discuss the significance of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association. After the meetings, a signature campaign was launched. According to the membership registration forms sent to the general branch by various districts, there are currently nearly 5,000 members in the suburbs, mainly farmers.
    Farmers in various suburbs have unanimously and enthusiastically supported the establishment of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association. Li Yonglin, director of the Guantongdian Farmers' Association in the 13th district, said: "The Soviet Union is helping us build a new country, truly China's first good friend. We must be friendly with them. The United States is a country ruled by reactionaries, specializing in suppressing the people." Liu Ziming said: "As the saying goes: 'Get close to gold, and you become like gold; get close to jade, and you become like jade.' If we get close to the Soviet Union, we will move in a good direction. If we rely on the United States, we will move in a bad direction. So why shouldn't we be friendly with the Soviet Union?" Farmers in the 17th district recognize that the Soviet Union is the leader of world peace. Without the Soviet Union, the revolution would not succeed. Mu Hongpu said: "The establishment of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association will promote the unity of peace-loving countries in the world, which is not only beneficial to China but also has an international impact."
    [Further Report] Chai Zemin, chairman of the suburban general branch preparatory committee, convened the heads of the preparatory committees of the branch associations in various suburban districts on the 14th to discuss issues such as developing membership and promoting the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association. Various districts enthusiastically put forward opinions. Finally, Chai Zemin summarized, emphasizing: "Each district should earnestly carry out this work. In the future, we must change some of the incorrect understandings of the Soviet Union among the masses. Only by loving the Soviet Union can we learn from the Soviet Union's experience in building the country, transform China from an agricultural country into an industrial country, and lead China to prosperity and strength."

　　农民热爱中苏友好协会
　  数千人签名作会员
　  郊区总支会筹备会成立
    【本报讯】中苏友好协会北平市郊区总支会筹备会已于十四日成立，由柴泽民等担任筹委。自八月二十一日彭真同志在音乐堂报告后，各郊区分别召开农民、工人及教职员举行座谈会，讨论中苏友好协会意义，会后展开签名，依据各区目前送至总支会会员登记表统计，郊区已有会员近五千人，成份主要为农民。
    各效区农民对中苏友好协会成立都一致热烈拥护。十三区关东店农会主任李永林说：“苏联帮助我们建设新国家，真是中国第一个好朋友。我们必须跟他友好。美国是个反动分子当权的国家，专门压制人民。”刘子明说：“俗语道：挨金似金，挨玉似玉。咱们靠近苏联，就往好处走，靠着美国，就向坏处走，那咱为什么不与苏联友好呢？”十七区农民认识到苏联是世界和平的领导者，没有苏联，革命就不能成功。穆洪普说：“中苏友好协会建立，要促进了世界爱好和平国家的团结，不但对中国有好处，在国际上也有影响。”
    【又讯】郊区总支会筹备会主委柴泽民十四日召集各郊区支会筹委会负责人讨论中苏友好协会发展会员及宣传等问题。各区热烈提出意见，最后由柴泽民总结，他强调的说：各区应认真开展这一工作。今后必须转变群众中一些对苏联不正确的认识。我们只有热爱苏联，才能很好的学习苏联建国的经验，才能使中国由农业国变为工业国，使中国走向繁荣富强的道路。
