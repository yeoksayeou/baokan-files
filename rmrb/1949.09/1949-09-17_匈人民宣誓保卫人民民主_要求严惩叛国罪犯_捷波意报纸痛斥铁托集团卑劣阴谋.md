Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 16th: Polish Press Agency, Warsaw, September 14th: Following the publication of the indictment in the Hungarian Rajk treason case, the Hungarian Workers' Party and Rakosi have received thousands of telegrams. In these telegrams, the working people of Hungary express their deep indignation. Meetings have been held in Budapest and other cities, calling for severe punishment of the defendants, vowing to defend the People's Democratic state and its achievements with greater vigilance, to unite more closely around the Workers' Party and Rakosi, and to further develop production to strengthen the People's Hungary. All Hungarian newspapers have published special articles discussing the background and significance of Rajk and his accomplices' anti-people and anti-state conspiracy.

　　Czechoslovak newspapers published the indictment against Rajk and his accomplices. The Czechoslovak military newspaper, Obrana Lidu, emphasized that since 1945, Rajk had been working closely with American and Yugoslav spies, providing them with political, economic, and military intelligence. The trade union newspaper, Prace, stated that the exposure of the criminal activities of Rajk and his gang of villains foiled the conspiracy of these betrayers of peace and democracy. Polish newspapers all carried the full text of the indictment of the Hungarian traitor Rajk and his accomplices.

　　The Polish Communist Party's People's Tribune published a commentary entitled "The Foiled Plans of the Spies," stating: The indictment shows to what depths imperialism—Tito, its agent in Hungary—has fallen. It exposes the despicable methods of provocation, espionage, and subversion used by the Belgrade traitors and their Hungarian accomplices and imperialist masters against the People's Democratic countries and the international workers' movement. The indictment also shows that the most vile spies, agents, and fascists are engaged in conspiracies to subvert the democratic regime. Long before the Cominform made its decision, the Titoites had become an important tool of imperialism for espionage and subversion in the People's Democratic countries. The Rajk trial definitively exposes the Titoites as a group of despicable servants of imperialism and demonstrates the strength of the Hungarian Workers' Party in thwarting the enemy. The international workers' movement condemns the Titoites and the gang of imperialist spies with hatred and indignation and proves once again that the attitude towards the Soviet Union—the fortress of socialism—is the touchstone of one's attitude towards one's own nation. The working class will heighten its vigilance to guard against attempts by the enemy to infiltrate the ranks of the workers. From the beginning, the workers' movement has often been attacked by the bourgeoisie with espionage methods. However, due to its ideological class consciousness, the working class has always achieved ultimate victory in such struggles. A party of the working class that thwarts the conspiracies of its class enemies through its vigilance, a party guided by the principles of Marxism-Leninism, is an invincible force.

　　In referring to the London Daily Worker's reports on Yugoslavia, the Polish Communist Party's People's Tribune stated: The Tito group's heinous dictatorial regime is encountering the growing hatred and rejection of the masses of the Yugoslav people. Tearing off the mask of the traitor, spy, and Trotskyite lackey—Rajk—is a heavy blow to the Belgrade traitorous clique.

　　The Italian Communist Party's newspaper, Unità, stated: The exposure of the Rajk conspiracy has thrown Washington and Belgrade into confusion. Yugoslav newspapers dare not deny the facts. Tito did not expect the authorities of the Hungarian People's Republic to uncover his rebellious conspiracy so quickly. The Yugoslav dictator is now attempting to compensate for his losses by further distorting Marxism-Leninism and slandering the Soviet Union and its army, but nothing can change the serious blow to the Tito group constituted by the exposure of the Hungarian conspiracy.

### 匈人民宣誓保卫人民民主　要求严惩叛国罪犯  捷波意报纸痛斥铁托集团卑劣阴谋

　　匈人民宣誓保卫人民民主
  　要求严惩叛国罪犯
    捷波意报纸痛斥铁托集团卑劣阴谋
    【新华社北平十六日电】波兰通讯社华沙十四日讯：匈牙利拉伊克叛国案起诉书发表后，匈工人党和拉科西已接到数以千计的电报。在这些电报里，匈牙利的劳动人民表示他们深深的愤慨。在布达佩斯及各城市均举行会议，纷纷要求严惩被告，并誓言以更大的警惕来保卫人民民主国家及其成就，更紧密地团结在工人党与拉科西的周围，并进一步发展生产来壮大人民的匈牙利。所有的匈牙利报纸都刊登专文，论述拉伊克及其同谋者反人民反国家阴谋的背景和意义。
    捷克斯洛伐克的报纸刊登了对拉伊克及其同谋者的起诉书。捷军机关报奥布拉纳·里都报着重指出：自一九四五年以来，拉伊克便和美国及南斯拉夫的间谍密切合作；并把政治、经济与军事情报交给他们。职工会机关报布拉斯报说：拉伊克一伙恶棍们的罪恶活动之暴露，挫败了这些和平与民主的叛背者的阴谋。波兰各报纸均刊载对匈牙利卖国贼拉伊克及其同谋的起诉书全文。
    波共人民论坛报发表题为“受到挫败的奸细的计划”的评论称：起诉书显示了帝国主义——铁托在匈牙利的代理人，已堕落到何种地步。它揭露了贝尔格莱德叛徒及其匈牙利同谋者和帝国主义主子，对人民民主国家和国际工人运动所运用的挑拨、间谍和颠覆的卑劣手段。起诉书并显示了最卑贱的奸细、间谍和法西斯分子从事于颠覆民主政权的阴谋。在情报局作出决议以前很久，铁托分子就已变成帝国主义在人民民主国家进行谍报和颠覆活动的重要工具。拉伊克审讯确定地揭穿了铁托分子是帝国主义的一群卑劣的奴仆，并表现了挫败敌人的匈牙利工人党的力量。国际工人运动怀着憎恶和愤慨的心情谴责铁托分子和帝国主义奸细匪帮。并再次证明了：对苏联——社会主义的堡垒——的态度，就是对自己民族的态度的试金石。工人阶级将提高警觉性，防范敌人混入工人队伍的企图。工人运动从开始以来，就经常受到资产阶级用间谍方法来进攻。但工人阶级由于自己思想上的阶级警觉，始终在这样的斗争中获得了最后胜利。一个由于其警觉而挫败了它的阶级敌人阴谋的工人阶级的政党，一个为马克思——列宁主义的原则所指导的政党，就是一个不可战胜的力量。
    波共人民论坛报在论及伦敦工人日报关于南斯拉夫的报道时说：铁托集团大逆不道的独裁政权，正遭遇南斯拉夫人民群众的日益增长的憎恨与厌弃。把卖国贼、奸细和托洛斯基分子的走狗——拉伊克的假面具扯下来，就是对贝尔格莱德叛徒集团的当头棒喝。
    意大利共产党机关报团结报称：拉伊克阴谋的暴露，使华盛顿和贝尔格莱德陷于混乱中。南斯拉夫的报纸，不敢否认事实。铁托没有想到匈牙利人民共和国当局能够这样快地揭发他的叛逆的阴谋。南斯拉夫的独裁者现正企图以进一步歪曲马列主义和对苏联及其军队的谩骂来补偿其损失，然而却没有什么能够改变匈牙利阴谋揭露后所构成的对铁托集团的严重打击。
