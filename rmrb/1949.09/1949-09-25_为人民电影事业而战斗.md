Fighting for the People's Film Industry
    Liu Nianqu

　　People's cinema is a product of the new democratic society led by the proletariat. Such a new era and such a new social foundation define the basic characteristics of people's cinema. So far, the output of people's films is still too small. In addition to a dozen newsreels, there are only two feature films, "The Bridge" and "Returning to Our Own Ranks." Others, such as "White-Clad Soldiers," "Fighting Inner Mongolia," "Brilliant Radiance," "War Without Frontlines," and "Daughters of China," are still in production. However, based on my own superficial understanding, I might as well point out a few characteristics of people's cinema.

　　People's cinema is the people's cause—one of the enterprises, and it is truly art for the people ("first for workers, peasants, and soldiers, and second for the petty bourgeoisie," see Chairman Mao's speech at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art). This fundamentally distinguishes it from the films of American and British imperialism, as well as the films of the Kuomintang-controlled areas. There are state-owned and private film studios. The former does not exclude the latter. When a private company takes a film production route that truly serves the people, it will surely receive care and support from the public sector. This has already begun to be implemented due to the liberation of Shanghai. State-owned enterprises must be run as enterprises, which is completely different from the practice of operating entirely from the point of view of commerce, the market, catering, and speculation. There is only one standard that determines the film production route: whether it benefits the broad masses of the people. This is the first point. As one of the people's undertakings, cinema accepts the leadership of the Communist Party of China, because the Communist Party of China is the vanguard of the working class leading the Chinese revolution and construction. Facts have shown that, in the field of art and literature, the Communist Party of China understands better than any other person or group what is necessary for the revolution and the masses, and thus provides active leadership. This is the second point. People's cinema, like other departments of art and literature, requires "the unity of political and artistic criteria, the unity of content and form, the unity of revolutionary political content and the highest possible artistic form. ... We oppose both artistic works with harmful content and the so-called 'slogan style' tendency that only emphasizes content and ignores form. We should wage a two-front struggle on literary and artistic issues." (Ibid., pages 35) At the same time, it "puts political criteria in the first place and artistic criteria in the second place" (Ibid., pages 34). In other words, art must be subordinate to politics. This is the third point. From the existing products, including newsreels and feature films, it is not difficult for us to see that the class (proletarian, not revolutionary petty bourgeois) standpoint, mass viewpoint, and collective creation of the film workers involved in the production are like a red thread running through them. If you deviate even a little, you will betray the general policy of art and literature and be useless to the people. This is the fourth point. Such people's cinema has only a short history of eleven years so far. In the early years, "work was carried out under difficult conditions lacking modern hydro-electric equipment" (Yuan Muzhi: "Overview of Film Work in the Liberated Areas" booklet). It was not until 1946, when the Changchun Manchukuo Film Studio was taken over, that the first film studio—now the Northeast Film Studio—was established. In these three years, although admitting that "we are still not mature enough in training, our theoretical level of Marxism-Leninism is still very low, our grasp of policies is still insufficient, and there is still a naturalistic tendency in creation" (Ibid.), it has, after all, built a solid foundation from scratch, from bad to good, and embarked on a correct path. This is the fifth point. From the perspective of the development history of Chinese cinema, people's cinema is a new stage of development. It is no longer a quantitative increase in past achievements, but a qualitative change. "Negating traditional plagiarism and initially exploring a new style" (Ibid.) is one of the manifestations of this. This is the sixth point.

　　Since people's cinema is so completely different from the past Chinese cinema, it inevitably requires us—film workers and audiences—to look at it with new eyes. Past Chinese films (including progressive films), especially Hollywood productions, have left quite stubborn influences in the minds of film workers and audiences. If it is said that in the past many people were followers and admirers of Hollywood (recognition of British films came later), it does not seem too harsh. Only a few people are willing (or even dare) to determine that Soviet cinema is the most progressive cinema in the world; and without fundamentally distinguishing between British and American films, Soviet films, and past domestic films, only comparing their merits and demerits from the so-called "artistic" point of view, and wanting to learn from the Soviet Union on the one hand, while being fascinated by Hollywood on the other, is also not uncommon. Now, I think, it is time to completely eliminate these dregs. For film workers, we have no reason to keep ourselves confined to the past era and society. If, on the one hand, we have to admit the importance of ideological content (political criteria), and on the other hand, we are unwilling to resolutely abandon the old ways of the past, this road will not work; in the end, we will inevitably fall into the quagmire of formalism or even cosmopolitanism. For the audience, the days of seeking some stimulation and satisfaction from movies will not last long. Moreover, the composition of the audience is changing, and the audience's thinking (views) is also changing. I dare to assert that the "jewels and treasures" and "promiscuity" that are still longed for by petty citizens today, as well as the "Spring in a Small Town" and so on that are appreciated by intellectuals, will all be abandoned in the near future. The films that will be welcomed by the broad masses of the people are films that reflect the reality of the people's struggle.

　　The people's film industry welcomes and requires the participation of a large number of experienced and accomplished film workers who have worked in the Kuomintang-controlled areas for a long time to fight together for the people's film industry. Therefore, it requires us to completely abandon our past baggage and start from scratch. Let us think calmly, is this necessary? At least for myself, it is very necessary. It is necessary to go through this stage in order to become a useful small cog in the people's film industry.

　　Starting from scratch, the first requirement is to "change and transform one's own thoughts and feelings." Past experiences, theories, and techniques are not useless, but they must undergo a thorough criticism from the proletarian standpoint and the mass viewpoint. The idea that adding the ideological content of the liberated areas (plus) the technology of the Kuomintang-controlled areas will produce excellent people's films is just a subjective fantasy of a dualist. Holding past theories and techniques and going among the masses to find themes and subjects is still an impractical plan. Without first crushing the "petty-bourgeois kingdom" in the "depths of the soul" ("Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," page 16), it is not only useless, but also completely futile. One of the courses of transforming oneself is learning—"learning Marxism-Leninism and learning society" (Ibid., page 8). Learning Marxism-Leninism—Mao Zedong Thought—is not just memorizing and reciting doctrines, but the important thing is how to combine it with our own business (on this point, I will discuss it separately). "Studying the various classes in society, their interrelationships and individual conditions, their appearance and their psychology" (Ibid., page 8) is not only an important topic in creation, but also related to the overall business. Transformation and learning are not "graduated" all at once, but are a long-term struggle process. We have to learn while doing, and transform while learning; we have to learn seriously and do modestly.

　　Because the people's film industry has the correct leadership of the Communist Party of China and the people's democratic dictatorship provides material guarantees, its bright future is entirely predictable. In the future development, it requires the film workers of the old liberated areas and the newly liberated areas, young newcomers, and the broad masses of progressive audiences to work together; to seek breadth and depth on the existing foundation. For film workers who have worked in the Kuomintang-controlled areas for a long time, inferiority and arrogance are equally harmful. The important thing is to intensify learning and transform ourselves, in order to better fight for the people's film industry in the new democratic society led by the proletariat. Only in this way can past experiences, theories, and techniques be put to appropriate use and development, and can we truly serve the people with our own strengths.

### 为人民电影事业而战斗

　　为人民电影事业而战斗
    刘念渠
    人民电影是无产阶级领导的新民主主义社会的产物。这样一个新的时代，这样一个新的社会基础，就规定了人民电影的基本特质。到现在为止，人民电影的产量还太少。十几部新闻纪录电影之外，故事片只有“桥”和“回到自己队伍来”两部，其他如“白衣战士”、“战斗的内蒙古”、“光芒万丈”、“没有战线的战争”和“中华女儿”等等还在摄制中。然而，根据我自己的肤浅的了解，也不妨约略指出人民电影的几个特点来。
    人民电影是人民的事业——企业之一，是真正为人民（“第一是为着工农兵，第二才是为着小资产阶级”见毛主席在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话）的艺术。这就与美帝、英帝的电影，也与国统区的电影，从基本上区别开来了。电影厂有公营的，也有私营的，前者并不排挤后者，当私营的公司确走了它的为人民服务的制片路线的时候，它必取得公家的照顾与扶助。这一点，由于上海的解放，是已开始执行了的。公营的要做到企业化，这也与运去的完全从商业、市场、迎合、投机的观点出发的作风毫无相同之处。决定着制片路线的标准只有一个，即，是否对于广大的人民有好处。这是一。做为人民事业之一的电影，是接受中国共产党的领导的，因为中国共产党就是领导中国革命与建设的工人阶级的先锋队伍。事实已经指明，在文艺工作方面，中国共产党较之一切的人或集团，都更好的懂得什么是革命与群众所必需，从而给以积极的领导。这是二。人民电影，和其他部门的文艺一样，要求着“政治与艺术的统一，内容与形式的统一，革命的政治内容与尽可能高度的艺术形式的统一。……我们既反对内容有害的艺术品，也反对只讲内容不讲形式的所谓‘标语口号式’的倾向，我们应该进行文艺问题上的两条战线斗争。”（同上，三五页）同时，又“是以政治标准放在第一位，以艺术标准放在第二位的”（同上，三四页）。换句话说，艺术必须服从于政治。这是三。从已有的出品，包括了新闻纪录电影与故事片在内，我们不难看出，参与制片的电影工作者的阶级（无产阶级，不是革命的小资产阶级）立场，群众观点与集体创造是如一条红线似的贯串着的。离开了一点点，就会叛背了总的文艺方针，就会对人民一无用处。这是四。这样的人民电影，迄今为止，还只有短短的十一年的历史，开头几年“都是在缺乏近代水电设备的困难条件下”（袁牧之：“关于解放区电影工作概述”小册子。）进行工作的。直到一九四六年，接管了长春伪满映制片厂，才着手建立了第一个制片厂——现在的东北电影制片厂。这三年内，虽然自认“我们还是锻炼得很不够成熟的，我们马列主义的理论水平还很低，掌握政策还很不够，创作方面也还残留着自然主义的倾向”（同上），但毕竟是从无到有、从坏到好，打下了一个坚实的基础，走上了一条正确的道路。这是五。从中国电影发展史上看，人民电影是一个发展的新阶段，不再是过去成就的量的增加，而是一个质的变化。“否定了传统的抄袭，初步地摸索了新的风格”（同上）就是这种表现之一。这是六。
    人民电影既是这样的与过去的中国电影完全不同了，必然的要求着我们——电影工作者与观众换付眼光去看它了。过去的中国电影（包括进步的电影在内），特别是好莱坞出品，曾在电影工作者与观众的头脑中留下了相当顽强的影响。假如说过去不少的人曾是好莱坞的追随者与崇拜者（认识英国电影是较晚的事），似乎不算太苛。只有少数的人，肯于（甚至是敢于）断定苏联电影是世界上最进步的电影；而不从基本上将英美片、苏联片和过去的国产片加以分别，只从所谓“艺术”上比较优劣，一方面要向苏联学习，一方面又迷恋着好莱坞，也颇不乏人。现在，我以为，该是彻底清除这些渣滓的时候了。对于电影工作者说，我们没有理由再把自己羁留在过去的时代与社会里了。倘若一方面不得不承认思想内容（政治标准）的重要性，一方面又不肯毅然丢掉过去的那一套，是此路不通的；最后，将不可避免地陷入形式主义甚或世界主义的泥沼里去。对于观众说，向电影寻求某种刺激与满足的日子，不会再延续多久了。而且，观众的成份在变动着，观众的思想（看法）也在变动着。我敢于断言，今日仍为小市民所向往的“珠光宝气”与“人尽可夫”以及为知识分子所欣赏的“小城之春”等等，都要在不久的将来被抛弃了。代之而受广大群众欢迎的电影，是反映人民斗争现实的电影。
    人民电影事业欢迎着并要求着广大的、有经验又有成就的、曾长期在国统区工作过的电影工作者参加，共同为人民电影事业而战斗。因此，就要求我们完完全全的抛掉过去的包袱，从头学起。让我们平心静气地想一想吧，这是不是必要的呢？至少对于我自己说，这是非常必要的。一定得经过这一阶段，才可能成为人民电影事业中的一个有用的小螺丝钉。
    从头学起，首先要求“把自己的思想感情来一个变化，来一番改造。”过去的经验、理论与技术，并非毫无用处的，但是，得经过一番从无产阶级立场与群众观点进行的彻底的批判。那种解放区的思想内容加（ｐｌｕｓ）国统区的技术，即产生绝好的人民电影的想法，只是一种二元论者的主观幻想。挟着过去的理论与技术，走入群众之间去寻找主题与题材，也仍是一种非实际的打算。不先粉碎了“灵魂深处”的“小资产阶级的王国”（“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”一六页），不仅一无是处，而且，完完全全是一番徒劳。改造自己的课程之一，是学习——“学习马列主义和学习社会”（同上，八页）。学习马列主义——毛泽东思想，不是摘章摘句的背诵教条，而重要的在于如何与我们自己的业务结合起来（关于这点，容当另论）。“研究社会上的各个阶级，它们的相互关系和个别状况，它们的面貌和它们的心理”（同上，八页），不仅是创作上的重要课题，也关联着全面的业务。改造与学习，不是一下子就“毕业”的，而是一个长期的斗争过程。我们得边做边学，边学边改造；我们得认真的学，虚心的做。
    由于人民电影事业有着中国共产党的正确领导，有着人民民主专政的政权给以物质保障，其前途的光辉灿烂，是完全可以预言的。在今后的发展中，正要求着老解放区的、新解放区的电影工作者，年青的新人，以及广大的进步的观众，一道努力；在已有的基础上求广。求深。对于曾长期在国统区工作过的电影工作者说，自卑与自傲同样的有百害而无一利。重要的是加紧学习，改造自己，以期较好的在无产阶级领导的新民主主义社会中为人民电影事业而战斗。只有这样，才可以使过去的经验、理论与技术得到适当的用处与发展，才可以切切实实的以一己之长为人民服务。
