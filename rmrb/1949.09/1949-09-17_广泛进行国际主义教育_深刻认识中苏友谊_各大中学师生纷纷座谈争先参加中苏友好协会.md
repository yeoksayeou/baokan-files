　　Broadly Carry Out Internationalist Education
  　Deeply Understand Sino-Soviet Friendship
    Teachers and Students of Major Middle Schools Held Discussions and Eagerly Participated in the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association
    [Report from our newspaper's correspondents in various schools in Ping Municipality] The Chinese Communist Party branches of Peking University, Normal University, Jiaotong University's Ping Branch, Yenching University, and other schools, in conjunction with their respective Communist Youth League, student unions, faculty and staff unions, and worker-police unions, have formed preparatory committees for the branch of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association. They are carrying out internationalist and patriotic propaganda in a planned and step-by-step manner, thoroughly eliminating the remnants of reactionary propaganda against the Soviet Union by imperialists and the Kuomintang reactionaries on young students, and then launching a signature campaign to join the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association. Peking University and Normal University successively held Sino-Soviet friendship forums, and the Railway Institute divided into groups for discussion. This enabled students to resolve problems of lack of understanding or unclear understanding of the Soviet Union, and to clarify the great significance of Sino-Soviet friendship ideologically. When Normal University discussed Sino-Soviet relations, professors and students competed to expose their incorrect ideas. They deeply hated the deception and poisoning of the Chinese people by imperialist and Kuomintang reactionary propaganda. They believed that they must understand the Soviet Union, learn from the Soviet Union, and enhance the friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union from the basic perspectives of the proletarian standpoint and the laws of social development. Professors at Normal University successively expressed their opinions on "big-character posters," calling for participation in the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, first signing up themselves, and more than 800 people signed up within two days on the 13th and 14th. Since Peking University convened a forum on the 8th, signature campaigns have been launched at all department levels. All students in the pre-medical and chemistry departments have signed up, and most students in the Chinese, economics, and law departments have participated so far.
    The Party branches, Communist Youth League branches, and student unions of various middle schools, in cooperation with the school authorities, have successively mobilized students to collectively visit the Soviet Construction Picture Exhibition, and listened to lectures on Sino-Soviet issues. They held discussions or forums after returning to school, and wall newspapers also published special issues on Sino-Soviet issues, enabling students to further understand the Soviet Union under the education combined with theory and practice. On the 13th, the faculty and staff of the Second Women's Middle School held a discussion themselves to clarify their viewpoints before explaining them to the students in order to carry out planned internationalist education for the students. After visiting the exhibition, more than 300 people signed up on the spot to join the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association at the forum of the First Municipal Middle School on the 10th.
