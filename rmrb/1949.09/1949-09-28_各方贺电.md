Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 27th: The Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference received a congratulatory telegram from the South China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. The telegram reads as follows:

To the Presidium of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and to all representatives:

We are delighted to learn of the opening of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in Beijing. The tens of millions of people in the liberated and yet-to-be-liberated areas of South China share the excitement. The opening of the People's Political Consultative Conference shows that Chinese history has entered a new era. In the past, the people of South China suffered long-term oppression under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, but for the past three years, under the leadership of the Communist Party, they have waged a heroic and unyielding struggle and have achieved great victories. In Guangdong Province alone, over 13 million people have been liberated. People's own political power has been established on one-third of the province's land, and nearly 100,000 people's armed forces have been organized and are continuing to grow. They are now mobilizing all their strength to support the liberation war, welcome the southward march of the Liberation Army, and have recently begun to victoriously meet the main forces of the People's Liberation Army in the front-line areas. The time to completely defeat the Kuomintang reactionaries and completely liberate South China is not far off. We will intensify our efforts to quickly liberate South China to celebrate the success of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and the birth of the People's Republic of China. We send this telegram to express our congratulations.
