　　To complete the post-war Stalin Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule, the socialist competition, in terms of its mass character and the richness of the creative activities of the Stakhanovites, has indeed reached an unparalleled scope. The Soviet people have found completely new paths and methods to shorten the time to complete the Five-Year Plan tasks and to accelerate the process of our country from socialism to communism. All this is due to the great work of the Lenin-Stalin Party in educating our people with a spirit of selfless loyalty to our great motherland and a spirit of ardent Soviet patriotism.

　　The innovators of production—advanced Stakhanovites, technicians, and engineers—heroically opened up new paths in production technology and organization, creating new methods of high labor productivity; they are the bearers of technological progress. Their creative labor has become a model for industrial and transportation workers.

　　Now the upsurge of socialist competition is closely linked with the initiative of the innovators and the pioneering role of the Stakhanovites. Based on the initiatives of advanced elements, movements are unfolding on a broad front to accelerate the turnover of working capital, for excellent product quality, for producing extra-plan products with economical raw materials, for a high level of production culture, and for accelerated working methods. As a rule, under the conditions of socialist industry, every valuable and beneficial initiative that occurs in one enterprise is immediately moved to other factories, workshops, and other industrial sectors, becoming the property of millions of people.

　　But this does not mean that the work of disseminating advanced Stakhanovite experience can be carried out spontaneously. On the contrary, this requires economic leaders, Party and trade union organizations to support and disseminate the initiatives of the advanced elements with the most attentive and concerned attitude, as never before.

　　The implementation of advanced production experience has great economic and national significance. These experiences should be meticulously collected and studied to arm all participants in the movement to complete the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule.

　　The proven methods of disseminating Stakhanovite experience, such as production meetings, Stakhanovite schools, creative conferences of professional Stakhanovites, and others, have penetrated deeply into the daily practice of our enterprises. These forms of promoting the achievements of advanced Stakhanovites should be adopted as widely as possible! But this is not enough today. The advanced Stakhanovite experience accumulated by various enterprises should be organized and given a more profound scientific generalization. Highly educated specialists must be absorbed into this important work.

　　In this regard, the people of Moscow have provided a good example; they are the pioneers in striving to complete the Five-Year Plan in four years. For example, in connection with the widespread implementation of accelerated metal processing methods in the capital's machine-building factories, a technical conference was held not long ago at the suggestion of the Moscow Municipal Committee of the Party. Before the meeting, a huge amount of work was done to explain and summarize the experience. Public reviews of accelerated machine work methods were conducted in the factories. Hundreds of experts came to the workshops to scientifically study the advanced labor methods of the Stakhanovites. At the technical conference, which was attended by 1,500 industrial workers, the collected materials were given a comprehensive discussion, and necessary conclusions were drawn, pointing out ways to further disseminate accelerated metal processing methods. The materials of the conference were printed as a separate publication.

　　In Leningrad, the friendly cooperation between scientific workers and direct producers is being consolidated, and the experience of advanced enterprises in the mechanization of technology and production processes is being organized and studied on a scientific basis. All this promotes the fullest and most effective broadcasting of valuable methods to other enterprises and related industrial sectors.

　　The industrial ministries play a huge role in organizing the exchange of advanced work experience and in broadcasting technical achievements. There are no experience exchange bureaus within the technical administrations of the ministries, and their activities far from meet the requirements of life and the needs of production. As pointed out at the conference of economic activists in the transportation machinery manufacturing industry, the exchange of experience between factories is not done well. In transportation machinery manufacturing enterprises, for almost two years, a technical competition has been carried out at the initiative of innovator Ivanov, in which thousands of engineers and technical workers participated, creating many new and valuable technical methods. However, their experience has not been summarized by the technical administration of the ministry. Two months have passed since the conference of activists of the ministry, and in fact, almost nothing has been done to correct the shortcomings pointed out.

　　The same situation exists in other ministries. The technical administration of the Machine Building Ministry does the worst job of summarizing the advanced experience of precision production. Rich experience in the application of continuous conveying has been accumulated in the ministry's tool factories! The workers of textile enterprises justly complain that the scientific research institutes of this industrial sector have not participated in the struggle for saving raw materials put forward by the factories.

　　The advanced experience in our industry should be applied most widely. The task of the Party organizations in various places is not only to support and develop the creative suggestions of the innovators in all aspects, but also to care about spreading their experience among the masses of the entire competition. The success of the competition, the achievement of the greatest and most significant results, ultimately depends on this. And in order to truly adopt the experience of the innovators, it is necessary to fully study and summarize these experiences.

　　Today, thousands of enterprise groups are emulating the example of the Muscovites, completing the Five-Year Plan in four years in terms of production volume. They have mobilized supplementary reserves to accelerate the speed of labor and to produce extra-plan products. From these tasks, the widespread dissemination of the production experience of advanced elements has gained special significance.

　　Arming each participant in the socialist competition with advanced working methods—this means achieving a greater increase in labor productivity and further increasing and improving the quality of products.

### 深刻地研究与传播先进的生产经验

　　深刻地研究与传播先进的生产经验
    张震寰译
    为了提前完成战后斯大林五年计划的社会主义竞赛，按照它的群众性与斯太哈诺夫工作者创造活动形式的丰富性来说，确实达到了无比的范围。苏维埃人们为缩短完成五年计划任务的时间，为加速我们国家从社会主义到共产主义的过程，找到了完全新的道路与方法。这一切是由于列宁——斯大林的党以忘我的忠实于自己伟大的祖国的精神，以热烈的苏维埃爱国主义的精神教育我们人民巨大工作的结果。
    生产的革新者——先进的斯太哈诺夫工作者、技师们、工程师们，在生产技术和组织中英勇地开辟了新的道路，创造了高度劳动生产率的新方法，他们是技术进步的担承者。他们的创造性的劳动，成了工业和运输工作者之榜样。
    现在社会主义竞赛的热潮是与革新者的积极性，参加者的斯太哈诺夫式的带头作用密切地联系着的。根据先进分子的创议，为了加速流动资金的流转速度，为了产品的优良质量，为了以节约的原料制造超计划的产品，为了生产之高度文化，为了工作的加速方法，而进行的运动，以广阔的战线展开了。照例，在社会主义工业条件之下，凡发生在一个企业中的每一个宝贵的有益的创举，马上就搬到其他工厂作坊、其他工业部门，而成为千百万人们的财产了。
    但这并不是说，先进的斯太哈诺夫式的经验之传播工作是可以自流地进行的。恰恰相反，这要求经济领导者，党的和职工会的组织，象以前任何时候一样，要以最注意的最关心的态度来支持与传播先进者的创举。
    先进的生产经验之实施，有巨大的经济的、国家的意义。应当缜密地搜集、研究这些经验，以之武装提前完成五年计划运动之一切参加者。
    经过考验的传播斯太哈诺夫经验的方法，如生产会议、斯太哈诺夫学校、有关职业斯太哈诺夫工作者的创造会议及其他等，已深入于我们企业的日常实践中。应该尽可能广泛地采用这种发扬先进的斯太哈诺夫工作者成就之形式！但这一点今天已经不够了。应当组织各企业所积累起来的先进的斯太哈诺夫式的经验，并加以更深刻的科学的概括。必须吸收高深造就的专门家参加到这个重要的工作中来。
    在这一关系上，莫斯科人提供了很好的榜样，他们是争取四年内完成五年计划的先锋。比如，与首都机器制造工厂中广泛实行金属加工的加速方法相联系，按照党莫斯科市委的建议，不久以前举行了技术会议。会议之前曾进行了说明和总结经验的巨大工作。在工厂中进行了对机器的加速工作方法之公共检阅。数百专家来到车间，科学地研究了斯太哈诺夫者的先进的劳动方法。在技术会议上，有一千五百多工业工人参加，将收集的材料给以全面的讨论，并做出了必要的结论，指出了更进一步传播金属加工的加速方法的办法。会议的材料曾印成了单行本。
    在列宁格勒，科学工作者与直接生产者的友谊合作正在巩固着，并在科学的基础上正在组织研究与总结工艺学与生产过程机械化方面的先进企业之经验。这一切就促进了宝贵方法之最充分最有效的广播到其他企业中和有关的工业部门中去。
    在组织先进工作经验的交换中，在技术成就的广播上，工业各部起了巨大的作用。各部技术管理局之中没有经验交换局，而它们的活动远不能满足生活的要求与生产的需要。如在运输机器制造业经济活动分子会议上曾指出，工厂之间的经验交换做的不好。在运输机器制造企业中，差不多两年来，由革新者伊凡诺夫的提倡，实行了技术竞赛，在此竞赛中参加了几千个工程师与技术工作者，他们做出了许多新的宝贵的技术方法。然而他们的经验，未被该部技术管理局所总结。自该部活动分子会议以来已过了两个月了，而实际上对改正所指出的缺点，几乎什么也没有做。
    在其他各部里也有同样的情形。机器制造部技术管理局对精制生产先进经验的总结做的最糟糕。在该部的工具工厂中积累了应用不断输送的丰富经验呵！纺织企业的工人们公正地诉说，这个工业部门的科学研究所还没有参加工厂所提出的节约原料的斗争。
    我们工业中的先进经验，应当最广泛的运用起来。各地党的组织的任务，不仅是各方面支持与发展革新者的创造性的建议，而且要关心在全部竞赛的群众中传播他们的经验。竞赛的成功，最巨大和显著的结果的成就，最后有赖于此。而为了真正地采用革新者的经验，必须充分地研究，总结这些经验。
    今天数千企业团体仿效莫斯科人的榜样，在生产量上要在四年内完成五年计划。他们为了加速劳动速度，为了生产超计划的产品，动员了补充的后备军。从这些任务说来，先进分子生产经验的广泛传播，获得了特殊的意义。
    以先进的工作方法武装社会主义竞赛的每个参加者——这就是说获得劳动生产率之更大的提高，生产品之更进一步增加和质量的改善。
