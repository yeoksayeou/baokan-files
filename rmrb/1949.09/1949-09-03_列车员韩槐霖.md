　　Train Conductor Han Huai-lin
    Zhu Ping
    7:00 AM, August 24, 1949.
    Tianjin Station, Pingjin Railway, direct express train to Beijing.

    The train departed. A dispute arose in the third-class carriage: two tickets with the same number, 40, appeared. A said A's ticket was genuine, B said B's ticket was genuine. The young train conductor in the blue uniform came to resolve the authenticity issue. After carefully examining both tickets, he immediately judged: A's ticket was a fake. His reasoning: the total number on A's ticket was from a series issued several days ago. A said the ticket was bought from a ticket scalper, proving he had been swindled. The conductor instructed him not to buy from any individual outside the station and processed a supplementary ticket for him, resolving the matter.

    The conductor searched around and went to the baggage car. He saw that the water seeping from the seafood baskets was about to wet the passengers' luggage. He immediately moved the seafood packages to the corner of the car. Then he stood at the car door, gazing at the northern countryside.

    A young passenger from Southeast Asia, with dark skin, also stood at the car door enjoying the breeze, excitedly watching the conductor. The two began to talk, with the young conductor initiating the conversation:

    "Our railway system implements a comprehensive responsibility system for train crews. What does this mean? It means that all employees must genuinely take responsibility and honestly serve the people. Based on my four or five years of experience on the railway, I am confident that I can resolve any issues on the railway, such as ticket scalpers selling black market tickets. We have ways to deal with them. We would never have done this in the Kuomintang era."

    "Why?"

    "Just look at our lives! Back then, we were beaten and humiliated. Now, those troubles are gone. After work, we also have study sessions. Our political and cultural understanding has improved. This is all thanks to Chairman Mao. My brother is not like me; he is stubborn and sometimes can't be persuaded. I really want him to go and suffer with old Chiang."

    "How many trips do you make a day?"

    "The Kuomintang destroyed many trains. Even this direct express train is one of the few good ones left. Because there are so few trains, we run four trips between Pingjin a day, two back and forth. After returning, we also have critique meetings to review our work and make improvements." Then he asked the young passenger, "How do you in Southeast Asia view us?"

    The young passenger said, "The motherland has become a vibrant place. We have returned to study and serve the people. I am very happy to see your spirit of service. Chairman Mao has led us onto the path of light. You have really given me a new lesson."

    The conductor was also pleased. On his blue uniform, below the red star on his left chest, was his name "Han Huai-lin." He is a young train conductor who recognizes his path.

　　列车员韩槐霖
    祝平
    一九四九年八月二十四日七时。
    平津铁路天津站，上行直达对号车上。
    车开了。三等甲车上起了一场纠纷：四十号座次有同号的两张票出现。甲说甲的是真票，乙说乙的是真票，蓝衣服的青年列车员来解决真假问题，他将两张票要去仔细一看，马上就判断了：甲的是假车票。他的判断是：甲的车票总号数是前几天排出去的。甲说票是向黄牛党买的，这就证明他上了当。列车员嘱咐他不要向车站以外的任何个人去买，同时给他办了补票手续，风波就此平息。
    列车员东索西寻，到了行李车，他见海鲜蒲包渗出来的水快要把客人的行李打湿了，他马上把那几包海鲜移到车角上，之后他又立在车门口张望着这北国的原野。
    一位南洋来的青年旅客，黝黑的皮肤，也站在车门口吹风，兴奋的看着这位列车员，两个人便谈起来，首先是青年列车员开口：
    “咱们这个铁路上是行的包乘负责制，什么叫包乘负责制呢，就是大家员工要确确实实负起责任来，老老实实的为人民服务，依我服务铁路四五年的经验敢自信铁路上的什么花头都能解决，如黄牛党的卖黑票呀，我们有办法。这在国民党时代，我们绝不会这样干的。”
    “为什么？”
    “这看看我们的生活罢！那个时候是挨打受气，现在这些苦恼没有了，工作完毕还有学习，我们的政治和文化也高了，这都是毛主席给我们带来的。我哥哥就不和我一样，他顽固，有时劝不着，真想让他跟蒋老头子去受罪。”
    “你们一天工作跑几趟车？”
    “车子被国民党破坏的很多，就算我们这列直达快车吧，是几条路仅有的好车了。为了车少，我们一天跑平津四趟，两来两往，回去后还要开检讨会，检讨我们的工作，以便改善。”接着他又问青年旅客：“你们在南洋怎样看我们呢？”
    青年旅客说：“祖国变成了一个有生气的地方，我们回来学习服务人民，我看到你的服务精神，我真高兴，毛主席已将我们引向光明的路了，刚才你实在给我上了新的一课。”
    列车员也欢喜起来。他的蓝衣服，左胸前红星下面，写着他的名字“韩槐霖”，他是一个认识了自己道路的青年列车员。
