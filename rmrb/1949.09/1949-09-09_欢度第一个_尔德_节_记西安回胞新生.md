　　In the Red May, when the People's Liberation Army planted the flag of victory on the city of Xi'an, the city's 60,000 Hui people, like all Han people, breathed a deep sigh of relief. The Hui people were liberated.

　　July 28th was the solemn "Eid" festival for the Hui people. For the first time, the Hui people of Xi'an celebrated this day of fasting with unparalleled joy. The number of Hui people who performed prayers in various mosques was more than double that of previous years. All the Hui people in the city wore new clothes and white hats, and walked into the mosques in groups. More than a thousand Hui people performed prayers at the Huajue Lane Mosque. Xian Municipal People's Government's Chief of the Minority Affairs Department, Xian Weijun, and others also participated. The Hui people happily chanted scriptures and prayed. The Ahong, while explaining the religious doctrines, excitedly said: "Today is Eid, we are wearing fresh and clean clothes, lighting incense, and performing ablutions..." He thanked the Communist Party and the democratic government on behalf of the Hui people for protecting Islam and respecting and caring for the life customs of the Hui people. Ma Haowen, a Hui citizen who sells Zonggao, told reporters after participating in this prayer: he also sold Zonggao during the rule of the Hu Zongnan bandit gang. The Hu bandit officers, soldiers, police, and secret agents forcibly ate and demanded goods on credit every day, and his capital was depleted a lot. Life was impossible. After the liberation of Xi'an, his business was guaranteed. In just over a month, he used the money he earned from selling Zonggao plus other savings to buy a mule and repair a cart. Ma Haowen's life and mood are just one example of countless Hui and Han people in Xi'an.

　　Before the First Field Army marched into the Northwest to pursue and annihilate the Ma bandits, it promulgated the "Regulations on Uniting with the Hui People," which clearly stipulated to the entire army the protection of mosques and tombs, non-interference with the Ahong's night prayers, and not eating pork or mule meat in Hui people's homes... We must respect the religious habits of the Hui prisoners of the Ma bandit army. When training Hui prisoners, we do not object to their religious rituals such as praying, and we allow them to have separate meals... On June 27, the Xi'an Mass Daily published an "Open Letter to Hui Officers and Soldiers of the Ma Army" from the Hui people of Xi'an. This was a sincere confession, which stated: "For many years, we have lived a muddled life, deceived by the Chiang Hu bandit gang. They (referring to the Chiang Hu bandit gang) said: 'When the People's Liberation Army comes, we will not be allowed to believe in religion, mosques will be burned down, and no one will survive.' Now Xi'an has been liberated. We have personally seen the People's Liberation Army—truly a disciplined army that loves the people." The letter went on to say: "The Muslims (believers in Islam) in Xi'an are all safe, and all the mosques are well protected. Only now do we realize that everything we heard in the past was completely a rumor to deceive us." The open letter to Hui officers and soldiers, after recounting the serious disasters that the Jiang Ma bandit gang had brought to the Han and Hui people in the Northwest, earnestly called on the Hui people in the Ma bandit army to immediately turn their guns around and stand on the side of the people. The text wrote: "Now we should avenge our parents, wives and children, the Muslims in the Northwest provinces, the entire Islamic faith, and the suffering and oppressed people across the country, and point our guns at the real enemies—the traitor Chiang Kai-shek, Hu Zongnan, Ma Bufang, Ma Hongkui, Ma Jiyuan, and those who deceive us!"

　　欢度第一个“尔德”节
  　记西安回胞新生
    本报特稿
    在红五月里，当解放军把胜利的旗帜插上西安城头的时候，全市六万回胞也同所有汉族人民一样，深长地吐出一口气。回民是解放了。
    七月二十八日是回民庄严的“尔德”节日。西安回民第一次以无比的欣慰度过这个斋戒的日子。在各清真寺举行礼拜的回民比往年多了一倍多。全市回民个个穿着崭新的衣裳，戴着白帽子，成群结队地走进清真寺里。在化觉巷清真寺作礼拜的回民有一千余人。西安市人民政府少数民族事务处处长鲜维俊等也都参加了。回胞们愉快地念经、祷告。阿訇在讲教义的时候，兴奋地说着：“今天尔德，我们穿着新鲜洁净的衣裳，点美香，洗大净……”他代表回民感谢共产党与民主政府对回教的保护、对回民生活风尚的尊重关怀。卖粽糕的回胞马浩文参加这次礼拜后对记者说：他在胡宗南匪帮统治时也卖粽糕，胡匪官兵与警察特务每天强吃霸赊，他的老本都亏蚀了不少。日子无法过。西安解放以后，他的买卖有了保障。仅仅一个多月，他用卖粽糕赚的钱加上别的积蓄，已经买了一头骡子，修了一辆大车。马浩文的生活与心情，只是西安无数回汉人民中的一个例子。
    第一野战军向西北进军追歼两马匪军之前，曾颁布了“团结回胞守则”，向全军明白规定保护清真寺、拱司，不干涉阿訇夜间礼拜念经，不在回民家吃猪、骡肉……。我们对于马匪军的回民俘虏的宗教习惯必须尊重，在回民俘虏集训时，不反对他们进行礼拜念经等宗教仪式，允许他们另起伙食……。六月二十七日，西安群众日报刊载了一篇西安回民“告马军回民官兵书”，这是一篇真诚的告白，上面说：“多年来我们过着糊涂的日子，受着蒋胡匪帮的欺骗，他们（指蒋胡匪帮）说：‘解放军来了，不准我们信教，要烧毁清真寺，谁也活不成。’现在西安已经解放了。我们亲眼见到了人民解放军——真不愧是纪律严明热爱人民的军队。”这封信接着写道：“西安的穆士林（信仰回教的人）都很平安，所有的清真寺都保护得很完整，过去我们听到的一切，到现在才知道完全是欺骗我们的谣言。”告回民官兵书在诉说了蒋马匪帮所给予西北汉回人民的严重灾难之后，恳切地号召马匪军中的回民立即倒转枪口，站到人民方面来，文内写道：“现在我们应该为自己的父母妻子，为西北几省的穆士林，为整个的伊斯兰，为全国受苦受难受压迫的老百姓复仇，把枪口向着真正的敌人——卖国贼蒋介石、胡宗南、马步芳、马鸿逵、马继援和欺骗我们的人！”
