　　Yoshida Government Bans Political Activities of Employees
  　Japanese Communist Party Lodges Strong Protest, Calls on All Opposition Parties to Unite in Struggle
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 27th] According to a Pyongyang dispatch from TASS on the 26th, quoting Tokyo news: The Japanese Communist Party has lodged a strong protest against the fascist measures of the Japanese government in prohibiting government employees from engaging in political activities. It demands the cancellation of this ban and suggests that all opposition parties unite to carry out a protest movement. Shiga Yoshio, a member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, said: This measure is "a replay of the crazy suppression actions of the Hitler, Mussolini, and Tojo eras, the purpose of which is to strengthen the dictatorial bureaucracy." According to the Yoshida government's ban, government employees are not allowed to participate in political parties, issue or distribute political printed materials, participate in elections, or speak at demonstrations and rallies. Violators will be sentenced to three years in prison and fined up to 100,000 yen.

　　吉田政府禁止雇员政治活动
  　日共提出坚决抗议号
    召各反对党联合斗争
    【新华社北京二十七日电】据塔斯社平壤二十六日电引东京消息：日本共产党对日本政府禁止政府雇员从事政治活动的法西斯措施，提出坚决抗议，要求取消这一禁令，并建议一切反对政党联合起来，进行抗议运动。日共中央政治局委员志贺义雄说：这一措施是“希特勒、墨索里尼和东条时代疯狂镇压行动的重演，其目的在于加强独裁的官僚机构”。依照吉田政府的禁令，政府雇员均不得参加政治党派，不能发行与散发政治印刷品、不能参加竞选或在示威与集会上讲话，违者将被处以三年徒刑和十万日圆以下的罚款。
