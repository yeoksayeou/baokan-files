Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 22nd: After the news of the opening of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference spread, all commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army Second Field Army were jubilant and their fighting spirit became even more vigorous. When the news reached a certain railway station, the commanders and fighters who were about to board the train immediately cheered and held a symposium at the station to support the People's Political Consultative Conference. Chen Baixiao, a first-class combat hero of a certain regiment, said excitedly: "Today's convening of the People's Political Consultative Conference was bought with the blood and sacrifice of tens of thousands of revolutionary comrades. This shows that the Chinese people have truly turned over and become their own masters!" He called on everyone: "To maintain this hard-won fruit, we must resolutely advance, liberate all of China, and annihilate the remaining enemies. Don't think that just because the country is about to be victorious, everything will be fine. Imperialism is not dead yet, and we must build a strong national defense force to defend the people's motherland." Other commanders, fighters, heroes, and model workers also spoke one after another, each firmly expressing their determination to greet the birth of the People's Republic of China by continuing to advance and completing the plan to annihilate the enemy and make meritorious service. When the news reached the organ troops, cadres and soldiers ran to tell each other. Instructor Wang of the directly subordinate hospital of the Field Health Department said to the wounded: "Comrades wounded, your blood was not shed in vain, the People's Political Consultative Conference has opened!" Wounded soldiers who had not been out for a month or two also excitedly held their bandaged arms or leaned on crutches, hobbling to attend the symposium. Zhang Zhongying, a wounded squad leader who was originally in General Li Xiannian's troops in the Central Plains, said painfully: "Under the leadership of the Communist Party, we fought against Japan for eight years and the War of Liberation for more than three years, climbing mountains and wading through rivers day and night, working hard. How many comrades shed their blood and sacrificed themselves, what were we doing for?" Then he stood up and said excitedly: "It is to establish our own central government! Now, it has finally been realized. Although I am disabled, I am unwilling to accept the recuperation money given to me by the public to go home. I want to participate in the great work of building a new China!" Other wounded soldiers also spoke, expressing their willingness to recuperate in peace, recover their health as soon as possible, return to the front line as soon as possible to participate in the great advance, and support and consolidate the People's Political Consultative Conference and the Central People's Government with practical actions. The medical staff expressed on the spot that they would support the People's Political Consultative Conference with practical actions, care for the sick and wounded, so that everyone could be discharged from the hospital as soon as possible, and strive for the liberation of all of China and the construction of a new China. When the news reached the motorcade and printing factory, it immediately aroused enthusiastic discussions among the workers. Long Yong and Liu Wanjun of the automobile maintenance company said at the discussion: "This is the people holding the knife handle, and there is no room for the reactionaries to turn over!" Driver Li Guangrong and others proposed to step up their work, exert their creativity, and respond to the call to rectify and save, and overcome difficulties. Li Qinghua, a typesetter in the printing factory, got up from his bed when he heard the news and insisted on working. At the symposium of printing workers, Ru Wanfu, an old machine worker who had worked for twenty-three years, said: "Everyone must work harder to consolidate our government. Now I am determined to further improve my skills, print books and propaganda materials better, improve the culture of commanders and fighters, and widely spread the truth." Zhao Tinggui, a lithographic worker, and others made plans on the spot to avoid wasting paper and save national expenses. The meeting unanimously adopted a letter to pay tribute to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu.

  　拥护人民政协召开
    【新华社南京二十二日电】中国人民政协开幕的消息传出后，人民解放军第二野战军全体指挥员战斗员莫不欢欣鼓舞，战志愈益奋发。消息传到某地车站时，正待登车出发的指战员们立即欢跃起来，并且马上在车站召开了拥护人民政协的座谈会。某团一等战斗英雄陈白小兴奋地说：“今天人民政协的召开，是成千成万革命同志流血牺牲换来的，这表示了中国人民真正翻了身，做了主人！”他号召大家说：“我们要保持这个千辛万苦培植出来的果实，必须坚决进军，解放全中国，歼灭残余敌人。不要以为全国快要胜利，就可以万事大吉了。帝国主义还没有死，我们还要建设强大的国防军，捍卫人民的祖国。”其他指战员和英雄模范也纷纷发言，每个人都坚决地表示要以继续进军完成歼敌立功计划来迎接中华人民共和国的诞生。消息传到机关部队时，干部战士纷纷奔走相告，野战卫生部直属医院王教导员见到伤员就讲：“伤员同志们，你们的血不是白流的，人民政协召开啦！”一两个月未能出来过的伤员也兴奋地捧着挂彩的胳膊，或者扶着拐杖，拐着脚吃力地走来参加座谈会。原在中原李先念将军所部的负伤的班长张仲英沉痛地说：“在共产党领导下，我们抗战八年，解放战争三年多，白天黑夜爬山涉水，艰苦奋斗，多少同志流血牺牲了，我们为的什么？”接着他就站起来激昂地说：“就是为的要建立人民自己的中央政府！现在，总算实现了。我虽然残废了，但我不愿接受公家给我的休养金回家，我要参加建设新中国的伟大工作！”其他伤员也纷纷发言，表示要安心休养，早复健康，早日重上前线参加大进军，以实际行动来拥护和巩固人民政协和中央人民政府。医务人员当场表示以实际行动拥护人民政协，爱护关心伤病员，使大家早日出院，为解放全中国和建设新中国而奋斗。消息传到汽车队及印刷厂时，立刻引起工人们的热烈讨论。汽车保养连龙涌、刘万俊等在讨论会上说：“这是人民握住了刀把子啦，再没有反动派翻身的余地了！”驾驶员李光荣等提出要加紧工作，发挥创造性，响应整编节约、克服困难的号召。印刷厂排字工人李青华病在床上，听见消息就爬起来要坚持工作。在印刷工人的座谈会上，工作了二十三年的老机器工人茹琬符说：“大家都要加油干，巩固我们的政府。现在我下了决心，要更加提高技术，把书和宣传品印得更好，提高指战员的文化，把真理普遍的宣传开去。”石印工人赵廷贵等更当场作出计划，要做到不浪费纸张，节省国家开支。会上并一致通过写信向毛主席、朱总司令致敬。
