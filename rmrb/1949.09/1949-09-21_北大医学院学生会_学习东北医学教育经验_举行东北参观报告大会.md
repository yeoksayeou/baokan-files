Peking University Medical College Student Union
　Learning from Northeast Medical Education Experience
　Holds Northeast Visitation Report Meeting
　　[This newspaper dispatch] The Peking University Medical College Student Union held a "Northeast Visitation Report Meeting" on the afternoon of the 18th at Peking University Hospital. Professor Hu Chuan-kui (Dean of the Medical College), student Zhang Yi-hao, and Doctor Han Zhe-wu, among eight members of the visitation group, reported on the conditions of medical education, teaching methods, medical work, pharmaceutical education, dental education, and public health in the Northeast. They unanimously praised the rapid development of medical education and public health in the Northeast within less than a year after the liberation of the entire region. The visitation group analyzed that the rapid development of medical education and medical work in the Northeast was due to: (1) the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government; (2) the high political awareness of medical personnel and teachers and students of medical schools, and their conscious and active work and study; and (3) the teaching method that closely integrates theory with practice, and the unified administrative system led by the Ministry of Health for both medical schools and hospitals. In their reports, the visitation group introduced in detail the specialist education system, image teaching method, collective study in groups of three, and the rotational teaching method for training a large number of medical personnel in the Northeast medical schools. They believe that these new teaching methods and systems are worth learning from other regions. Based on the insights and experiences gained from the Northeast visit, the visitation group has also submitted nine suggestions to the Medical College Council on strengthening political study, reforming the academic system and curriculum, reviewing and improving teaching methods, and reforming administration.
　　After the reports were completed, a free discussion began. Everyone inquired about the political studies and labor construction of the Northeast medical schools. The visitation group answered in detail one by one. In their speeches, everyone unanimously expressed the need to strengthen political study and learn from the Northeast medical schools in order to improve medical education and medical work. The meeting ended at 5:15 p.m.

    【本报讯】北大医学院学生会于十八日下午在北大医院举行“东北参观报告大会”。由参观团胡传揆教授（医学院院长）、章以浩同学及韩哲武大夫等八人分别报告了东北医学教育、教学方法、医务工作、药学教育、牙科教育、公共卫生、护士教育的情形。他们对于东北在全境解放不到一年内医药教育及公共卫生发展的情形一致表示赞美。参观团分析东北医药教育及医务工作的迅速发展是由于：（一）中国共产党及人民政府正确的领导；（二）医务人员及医校师生政治觉悟高，自觉积极地工作与学习；（三）理论与实际紧密结合的教学方法及医校与医院统一由卫生部领导的一元化行政制度。参观团在报告中详尽介绍了东北各医校的专科教育制、形象教学法、集体学习的三人小组与大批训练医学人材的轮回教学法。认为这些新的教学方法与制度值得各地学习。参观团并已根据东北参观的心得与经验向医学院院务会议提出加强政治学习、改革学制与课程、检讨并改进教学法及改革行政等九项建议。
