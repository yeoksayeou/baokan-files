　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 15th: Despite the Nehru government of India's best efforts to deny involvement in the Anglo-American plot to annex Tibet, British and American authorities are not shy about their ambitions to invade Tibet with the aid of the Indian government. According to a United Press dispatch from Tokyo on September 11th: "British authorities in the Far East are quietly spreading the word that they hope Tibet will seek the assistance of Western democracies should it feel threatened by Communist aggression." The British authorities are calling the People's Liberation War led by the Chinese Communist Party and the people of all ethnic groups in China to free themselves from the enslavement of foreign imperialism and domestic reactionary forces "aggression," while referring to their own aggression as "assistance," but such a reversal in language does not change the essence of the matter. According to the same dispatch, British authorities stated: "For many years, Britain has had great concern for Tibet because it is located north of India and has strategic value. In the past, when Tibet was friendly with Russia, Britain sent an expeditionary force to Lhasa, arriving in the city in 1904." It turns out that the British government is reliving old dreams; their "assistance" is to send an expeditionary force to massacre the Tibetan people, and the reason for wanting to "assist" is because Tibet has strategic value. The dispatch also reveals that in this act of aggression, British and American imperialism are colluding with each other, preparing to stage a play of crying "stop thief!" to catch the thief, fabricating a rumor of a Soviet "attack" out of thin air as a pretext for their sinister activities. The dispatch states: "British authorities hint that if Tibet feels it needs foreign aid to prevent a Communist attack from the Soviet Union via Xinjiang or from mainland China, the United States may be willing to participate in a plan to aid this mountainous Lamaist state (referring to Tibet)." As for the methods of invading Tibet, there are two ways: direct action and through the Nehru government. The British Information Service quoted an article from the Observer as saying: "Britain only has contact with Lhasa through its special commissioners in India." According to an AFP dispatch from London on September 10th, an unnamed British military officer is about to be dispatched to "visit" Tibet. The agency said that the British War Office has neither confirmed nor denied this news.

　　走狗尼赫鲁欲盖弥彰
  　美英暴露侵藏野心
    英公开与美帝勾结进行罪恶活动
    【新华社北平十五日电】尽管印度尼赫鲁政府竭力否认参与英美并吞西藏的阴谋，但英美当局却不掩饰他们经由印度政府援助而侵略西藏的野心。据合众社东京十一日电称：“远东的英国当局正在悄悄地传话，说他们希望西藏在一旦感受到共产党侵略的威胁时，寻求西方民主国家的援助。”英国当局把中国共产党所领导的中国各民族人民为摆脱外国帝国主义和本国反动势力的奴役而进行的人民解放战争称为“侵略”，而把他们的侵略活动称为“援助”，但这种文字上的颠倒，并不改变事情的本质。据同一电讯称，英国当局表示：“许多年来，英国对于西藏有着极大的关怀，因为它位于印度以北，具有战略价值。以前当西藏与俄国交好时，英国曾派远征军到拉萨去，于一九○四年到达该城。”原来英国政府正在重温旧梦，他们的“援助”就是派遣远征军屠杀西藏人民，而所以要“援助”是因为西藏具有战略价值。该电讯又透露，在这一侵略活动中，英美帝国主义是互相勾结的，它们准备演出一出喊贼捉贼的把戏，凭空捏造一项苏联“进攻”的谣言，以为它们进行罪恶勾当的借口。该电讯称：“英国当局暗示：如果西藏觉得需要外援来阻止从苏联经由新疆而来或者从中国本部来的共产党的进攻，美国可能愿意参加援助这个多山的喇嘛小邦（按指西藏）的计划。”至于侵略西藏的方法，则有直接下手与经由尼赫鲁政府两种。英新闻处引观察家星期刊文称：“英国仅经过印度特派员与拉萨有联系。”另据法新社伦敦十日电报道：一名姓名未经透露的英国军官即将被派遣“访问”西藏。该社说，对于这个消息，英国陆军部虽未证实但也不否认。
