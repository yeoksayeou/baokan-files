Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Front, 26th: Frontline reporter Zhou Xun reports on the heroic achievements of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, in coordination with the People's Guerrilla Force, capturing the Greater and Lesser Lian Islands outside Pingtan Island during a typhoon and completely annihilating a full regiment of defending enemies: On the morning of the 13th, a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army took only one hour to capture Lesser Lian Island, decisively annihilating an enemy company. At 8:30 that evening, they launched an attack on Greater Lian Island. At that time, the weather suddenly changed, a typhoon struck, and torrential rain poured down. But the soldiers, the People's Guerrilla Force members cooperating in the battle, and the boatmen were all fearless. They raised their arms and shouted: "We must resolutely fight the wind and rain, completely annihilate the defending enemy, and liberate Greater Lian Island!" On the stormy sea, the People's Liberation Army, tasked with the assault, rode in columns of sailboats, bravely advancing with the surging waves. The soldiers all raced to assist the boatmen in steering and rowing. The fleet advanced against the current for ten miles in the typhoon and broke through the island's bandit army defense line in fifty minutes, landing entirely on Tiger Tail Mountain in the southwest of Greater Lian Island. After landing, the assault team learned from prisoners that the bandit army's 714th Regiment headquarters had just arrived from Pingtan Island with two battalions as reinforcements, and their follow-up troops had been blocked by the typhoon. They seized the opportunity to launch an attack in the wind and rain, first annihilating a battalion of bandit troops entrenched in the western mountainous area of the island, and then advancing towards Weiying Mountain in the southeast. At this time, the battle became more intense, and the weather became even worse. Gale-force winds and heavy rain, flying sand and rocks, many houses and trees were blown down or uprooted, and the waves were dozens of feet high. Some of the boats parked on the shore were smashed to pieces, and the follow-up troops of the People's Liberation Army were unable to come. In such a critical situation, the landed People's Liberation Army and People's Guerrilla Force members stubbornly held their gained positions from 8:00 a.m. on the 14th until the afternoon. At 4:00 p.m., the warriors, who had been fighting for a day and night, endured hunger and cold and, in one burst of energy in the wind and rain, launched an assault on the enemy entrenched on the top of Weiying Mountain. On the muddy mountain road, although some soldiers fell more than a dozen times, they still charged forward, one after another, bravely and fiercely, and finally annihilated all the defending enemies on the mountain at 5:20 p.m. The two battalions of bandit troops, in the face of the People's Liberation Army warriors, surrendered and laid down their arms one after another. Thus, Greater Lian Island was completely liberated.

　　在暴风雨中渡海前进奋战一昼夜全歼守敌
    福建我军解放大小链岛经过
    【新华社福建前线二十六日电】福建前线记者周迅报道人民解放军某部在人民游击队配合下，在台风中攻占平潭岛外围大小链岛，并全歼守敌一个整团的英勇战绩称：十三日晨解放军某部仅以一小时的时间攻占小链岛、干脆歼敌一个连后，当晚八时三十分又发起对大链岛的攻击。当时气候突变，台风骤至，暴雨倾盆。但战士们和配合作战的人民游击队员们、船手们，均毫无惧色。他们振臂高呼：“要坚决与风雨作斗争，全歼守敌，解放大链岛！”在暴风雨的海面上，担任突击任务的解放军，分乘一列一列的帆船，随汹涌翻腾的海浪奋勇前进。战士们都争先协助船工掌舵、划桨，船队在台风中逆流前进十里，以五十分钟的时间突破了岛上匪军的防线，在大链岛西南虎尾山全部登陆。突击队在登陆后，由俘虏口中得知匪军七一四团团部率两个营刚从平潭岛增援而来，其后续部队已经被台风所阻，乃在风雨中乘机展开攻击，首将盘踞在岛上西部山区的一个营匪军歼灭，转而又向东南部的卫营山前进。此时，战斗益趋激烈，气候亦更恶劣，狂风骤雨，飞沙走石，不少房屋树木均被吹倒或拔起，海浪高达数丈，停泊岸旁的船只有的被摔成碎片，解放军后续部队已无法前来。登陆的解放军和人民游击队员们在这样危急的情况下，自十四日晨八时直至下午，一直顽强地坚持着既得阵地。下午四时，奋战一昼夜的勇士们，忍着饥寒，在风雨中一鼓足气，向高踞卫营山头的敌人发起冲锋。在泥泞的山路上，有的战士虽然摔倒十多次，仍然前仆后继，勇猛冲杀，至五时二十分终将山上守敌全部歼灭。两个营的匪军在解放军勇士面前，纷纷缴枪投降。至此大链岛乃全告解放。
