　　【Tianjin News】Eight wholesale grain merchants in this city, including Yong Zeng Hou, Ren Ji, and Xin Mao, collectively went to Datong, Fengzhen, and other places in the middle of last month to purchase miscellaneous grains. As of September 1st, 300 bags of red sorghum, 55 bags of millet, 60 bags of broad beans, and 17 bags of corn have been shipped to Tianjin. The rest are being shipped continuously, and the purchase and transportation procedures are said to be convenient. Based on the above situation, the Bureau of Industry and Commerce specially convened a general meeting of all members of the Grain Business Association at the Jincheng Grain Market on the 2nd, calling on all grain merchants to purchase grain in the Northwest. The grain merchants immediately organized a grain purchasing committee. Forty-nine merchants participated in the collective grain purchasing group and raised more than 50 million yuan as funds for purchasing grain in the Northwest. In order to make the purchase funds circulate in large quantities, the Bureau of Industry and Commerce is negotiating with the People's Bank on behalf of the merchants for acceptance financing.
