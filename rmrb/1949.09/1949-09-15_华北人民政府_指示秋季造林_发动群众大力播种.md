North China People's Government
Issues Directive on Autumn Afforestation
Mobilize the Masses to Vigorously Plant Seeds

[Reported by this newspaper] In order to collect a large number of tree seeds, launch an autumn afforestation campaign, and build nurseries, the North China People's Government issued a directive on the 12th of this month, calling on the masses to be mobilized to vigorously plant seeds and trees in a timely manner. The directive stated:

(1) In order to quickly and effectively eliminate barren mountains and build nurseries, it is necessary to mobilize the masses to collect a large number of seeds this autumn. The season has arrived, and governments at all levels should widely mobilize the masses to carry out this work. Plans should be made (the Yishui Special District proposed a "handful of apricot seeds per person" campaign during the rainy season), and serious supervision and inspection should be carried out to ensure that it is completed according to plan.

Regarding the selection of tree species, various regions can adapt to local conditions, but generally focus on collecting oak seeds, black locust, Chinese tamarisk, pine and cypress, tree of heaven, Chinese scholar tree, maple, and ash. In addition to vigorously mobilizing the masses to collect tree seeds for private wasteland planting and afforestation and nursery management, the government should also purchase a portion for public nurseries and public wasteland planting and afforestation. The work of collecting tree seeds should be combined with the autumn harvest, and women and children should be widely organized to participate.

(2) Autumn is a very good season for afforestation, as it is easy to survive, and the planting period is the longest. Tree planting and afforestation can be carried out from the time the leaves fall, and seed planting and afforestation can be carried out from the time the seeds mature until the ground freezes. After the autumn harvest, various regions should make full use of this long slack farming season to carry out this work. This autumn's afforestation in mountainous areas will generally focus on both seed planting and tree planting. Areas with few mother tree forests such as poplar and willow should particularly focus on seed planting; sandy wastelands and riverine areas should still focus on layering and cuttings; riverbank afforestation should be combined with river management projects. Seed planting should focus on large-grain seeds such as oak seeds, bitter apricot, walnut, mountain peach, chestnut, and wild jujube, as well as Chinese tamarisk seeds. In particular, this year we should strive to use all oak seeds for planting, because oak trees grow quickly and are very useful, but planting should be done as early as possible and completed this year, as they are prone to insect infestation and loss of germination power after the new year. Large seeds should be covered with deep soil to reduce rodent damage, and Chinese tamarisk seeds should also be planted slightly deeper to prevent them from being blown away by the wind.

This autumn's tree planting and afforestation should achieve the results of spring afforestation in areas where the masses have this habit. In areas where there is no such habit, it should be vigorously promoted, and at least one-third of the spring afforestation plan should be completed. Various regions can put forward specific requirements based on the tree seed situation for seed planting and afforestation. When the masses collectively plant trees on public wasteland, the public will generally provide the tree seeds, the forest benefits will belong to the masses, and the government will issue certificates. In autumn afforestation, it is necessary to further implement the forest protection policy. Grazing and firewood gathering should be strictly prohibited in afforestation areas (because they have not germinated, or have germinated little, and are easily mistaken for dry firewood), and special attention should be paid to protection by various means.

It is necessary to strictly implement the ban on mountains according to plan. This year, we will begin to implement a ban on about 5% of the barren mountains in the entire village, and the seed planting and afforestation area will be included in the banned mountain area.

(3) In order to carry out large-scale tree planting and afforestation movements in the future, we should vigorously mobilize the masses to manage nurseries this autumn and next spring. We can no longer rely solely on cuttings and layering. It should be publicized that those who change cultivated land to plant trees should be taxed at 30% of the normal annual output of the cultivated land (Article 4, Paragraph 3 of the North China Region Agricultural Tax Provisional Regulations), and the government will be responsible for solving the sales of saplings. Nursery income is greater than that of general crops, and the government can also provide loans to support it when necessary.

In addition to private nurseries, large-scale public nurseries should also be built in sandy wasteland, rivers, and barren mountains. The location of the nurseries should be close to the pre-planted area to save transportation costs. The area of the nurseries should generally be carried out according to the plan of the agricultural division chief meeting. Preparations should be made as soon as possible to solve the problems of land, seeds, and technicians.

### 华北人民政府　指示秋季造林　发动群众大力播种

　　华北人民政府
  　指示秋季造林
  　发动群众大力播种
    【本报讯】华北人民政府为大量采集树籽开展秋季造林运动和建设苗圃，于本月十二日发出指示号召发动群众及时地大力播种、植树。该指示称：
    （一）为了迅速而有效的消灭山荒和建设苗圃，今年秋季必须发动群众大量采集种籽，时令已届，各级政府应广泛动员群众进行这一工作。并订出计划（易水专区雨季曾提出每人一把杏籽运动），认真督促检查，务使其按计划完成。
    关于树种选择，各地可因地制宜，但一般着重采集橡籽、洋槐、荆条、松柏、臭椿、中国槐、枫树、白腊等。采集树籽除大力动员群众进行以备私荒播种造林和经营苗圃外，政府应收买一部，以备公营苗圃和公荒播种造林用。采集树籽工作要与秋收结合，广泛组织妇女儿童参加。
    （二）秋季是造林很好的季节，容易成活，且种植期最长，植树造林从树叶落，播种造林从树籽成熟到地冻前都可种植。在收秋后各地应充分利用这一漫长的农闲季节，进行这个工作。今年秋季造林，在山岳地区，一般是播种与植树造林并重。杨柳等母树林少的地区，特别着重播种造林；沙荒与沿河地区，仍着重压条和插枝；河沿造林要与治河工程结合。播种造林，以橡籽、苦杏、胡桃、山桃、板栗、酸枣等大粒种籽及荆籽为主。特别是橡籽今年争取所有橡籽全部作播种用，因橡树成长快，用处大，但播种宜早，并在今年要播种完，过年即易生虫而损失发芽力。大粒种子覆土宜深，以减少鼠害，荆籽也要稍种深些以免风刮跑。
    今年秋季植树造林，在群众有此习惯地区，应达到春季造林成绩。无此习惯地区，应大力提倡，最少作到春季造林计划三分之一以上。播种造林，各地可根据树籽情况，提出具体要求。群众集体在公荒上造林，一般由公家供给树籽，林益归群众，政府发给证据。在秋季造林中，要更进一步执行护林政策，植树造林地区，要严禁放牧和打柴（因未发芽，或发芽不多，易误认为干柴），并特别注意用各种办法进行保护。
    要认真按计划执行禁山，今年即开始以全村山荒百分之五左右实行封禁，播种造林地区即划入禁山范围内。
    （三）为了今后大规模开展植树造林运动，今秋及明春应大力发动群众经营苗圃，再不能单靠插枝压条，宣传以耕地改植林木者，应按耕地常年应产量折谷三成征税（华北区农业税暂行税则第四条三款），政府并负责解决树苗的销路，苗圃收入比一般作物收益大，必要时政府还可贷款扶植。
    除私营苗圃外，在沙荒河流山荒地区还需大规模的建设公营苗圃，苗圃设置要靠近预植地，以省运输费。苗圃面积一般应按农业处长会议计划进行，目前即应抓紧筹备，解决土地、籽种、技工诸问题。
