How to Prevent Epidemic Encephalitis
    Huang Zhenxiang, Hygiene Experimental Institute of Xiannongtan

    Everyone knows the importance of epidemic encephalitis, but how can we eradicate this disease and protect everyone from it? This is the question we want to discuss with everyone below. In the past, the reactionary government never paid attention to disease prevention. Even if researchers and those who actually worked on disease prevention made suggestions, they would not be approved; even if they were approved, they would not be truly implemented. That was just to appease the people and avoid criticism. Imperialist countries appeared to do a good job in epidemic prevention, but their goal was to protect the bourgeoisie. The current government is the people's government, truly serving the people. This time, when encephalitis broke out in the Beijing area, the people's government's health authorities paid great attention from the beginning, convening experts many times to discuss how to eradicate the disease, taking on the leadership responsibility in practice, actively treating patients, eliminating mosquitoes, and ordering all health institutions to conduct various investigations and research. Therefore, we now have absolute confidence that under the correct leadership of our people's government, with the unity of medical and health workers and the cooperation of the people, we can work together to eradicate this terrible disease in the near future.

    Several Prerequisites

    When it comes to the prevention of epidemic encephalitis, there are several issues that need to be resolved first: First, we should know what type of encephalitis is epidemic in the Beijing area? Second, we should know the epidemic situation of the disease? Third, we should know how the disease is transmitted? Where is the host of the disease's pathogen? We need to have a full understanding of these issues before we can talk about completely eradicating the disease.

    Typing Issues

    Encephalitis is caused by viral infection. Any virus that invades brain tissue cells and damages them can cause encephalitis. There are many types of encephalitis, some occur in summer, and some occur in winter, such as lethargic encephalitis (also known as Type A epidemic encephalitis), which occurs in winter. There are many types of encephalitis that occur in the summer: 1. Japanese Type B encephalitis; 2. St. Louis encephalitis; 3. Equine encephalomyelitis – with several types; 4. Soviet encephalitis; 5. Other types. In addition to these, there are also poliomyelitis, rabies, Newcastle disease-induced encephalitis, and post-disease or post-vaccination encephalitis that can also be found during the summer encephalitis epidemic season. Some encephalitis can be determined by clinical symptoms, such as rabies and poliomyelitis, but sometimes, like poliomyelitis, we cannot determine the type based on clinical symptoms alone. To determine the type of encephalitis, laboratory testing is required. There are currently two methods of laboratory testing: one is to isolate the virus from the brain tissue of deceased encephalitis patients and then identify the type of the virus; the other is to identify the type of immune bodies (antibodies) in the serum of encephalitis patients – complement fixation test and neutralization test – to identify the type. We (Infectious Disease Research Laboratory of the Hygiene Experimental Institute) have already started both of these tests, but the results have not yet been fully determined. We believe that we will be able to report the results to everyone soon, but we can now speculate that most of the encephalitis epidemic in Beijing in the summer is likely to be Japanese Type B, because: 1. From 1936 to 1941, at Peking Union Medical College, I and several other colleagues used serum identification to prove that most of the encephalitis epidemic in Beijing in the summer during that period was Japanese Type B; 2. In 1941, another person isolated a virus from the brain tissue of a deceased patient, and the neutralization test proved that it was Japanese Type B.

    The Epidemic Situation

    Next, we will talk about the epidemic situation of encephalitis, the vector of virus transmission, how the virus overwinters, how the epidemic starts, and the issue of prevention. The discussion of these issues assumes that the encephalitis epidemic in Beijing is Japanese Type B. There were cases of summer encephalitis in Beijing before 1936. Later, after laboratory proof, it was determined to be Japanese Type B, which began to attract the attention of clinicians. We can say that there are encephalitis epidemics of varying sizes in Beijing every summer. Last year, we conducted a statistical analysis based on the medical records of several major hospitals in Beijing. In 1948, there were 145 patients, and the mortality rate was 52.9%. The onset season was 11.7% in July, 73.1% in August, and 15.2% in September. Among all patients, except for the military, children under the age of ten accounted for 48.8%. This summer, according to statistics from the Health Bureau and the military, there were 190 patients in Beijing and its four suburbs as of the 6th of this month, with a mortality rate of about 50%. Among all patients, except for adults in the military, children under the age of ten accounted for more than 52%. Why do so many children suffer from encephalitis? The main reason is that children's blood lacks immune bodies. According to reports from several experts in Japan and the United States, more than 85% of normal people's serum in encephalitis epidemic areas in Japan and Korea contains immune bodies. Most infants aged one to three months contain immune bodies – obtained from their mothers who have immune bodies. After three months, the number of infants with immune bodies decreases significantly. By the age of one to three years, almost all children have no immune bodies. The blood of children over the age of four slowly increases again. Looking at the cases in the suburbs of Beijing this year, the locals who get sick are all children. Adults are mostly soldiers from non-epidemic areas who come to Beijing. According to statistics, children in Beijing account for about 20% of the total population. If we believe that people with immunity will not get sick, and all those who get sick are people whose blood does not contain immune bodies, then from a statistical analysis, comparing the incidence rate of the adult group with the incidence rate of the group of children under ten years old in the city's annual patients, adults in Beijing may have more than 80% immunity, and adults in the suburbs may be close to all with immunity. This calculation is naturally still a speculation, but this speculation can be proven by the neutralization test. We plan to do the neutralization test, but currently we have not started due to the limitation of the number of animals. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, Sabin of the United States took blood samples from adults over the age of seventeen in Tianjin and Shanghai (a dozen cases each) to do neutralization tests. According to the report, more than 85% of the serum contained immune bodies against Japanese Type B encephalitis. In this way, it seems that about 85% of adults in Beijing may also have immune capacity, and the remaining 15% without immune capacity will get sick. Therefore, encephalitis is unlikely to have a major epidemic in Beijing, and we don't need to be too afraid of it. But why do most adults have immunity to Japanese Type B encephalitis? This is mostly due to asymptomatic infections. In animals in epidemic areas in Japan and Korea, such as horses, cattle, sheep, dogs, pigs, chickens, ducks, etc., most of the blood contains immune bodies, which may also be due to asymptomatic infections. It can be seen that the epidemic of this disease is very widespread.

    What is the Vector for Transmitting the Virus?

    Soviet, Japanese, and American medical experts believe that the most likely vector for the transmission of Japanese Type B encephalitis virus is mosquitoes, because: 1. When encephalitis is epidemic, the virus can be isolated from mosquitoes; 2. Animal experiments can also prove that mosquitoes can transmit the virus to white mice and monkeys. Because it is impossible to use humans for encephalitis experiments, it has not yet been confirmed that mosquitoes are the vector for transmitting the disease to humans. Even so, based on the above animal experiments, medical experts still believe that mosquitoes are the most likely vector for transmitting the disease to humans. In addition to mosquitoes, there are also ticks (Soviet scientists Miller proved that they can transmit the virus in animal experiments). It seems that there may be other insects that are also vectors for encephalitis transmission, especially in the asymptomatic infection of animals.

    How Does the Virus Overwinter?

    Regarding the issue of how the virus overwinters, we still don't know. Soviet and Japanese medical experts have found that infected mosquitoes can transmit the virus to their offspring, but this work still needs to be proven. It has been confirmed that ticks can transmit the Soviet type encephalitis virus to their offspring. Whether animals are long-term hosts has not yet been proven.

    How Does an Epidemic Start?

    Based on various reports, we can gather them together for analysis and speculate on the most likely way an epidemic starts: For example, in early July, an infected mosquito bites an animal without immunity, and the virus multiplies in the animal's body and circulates in the blood (animal experiments have proven that after animals such as chickens, ducks, and pigs are injected with the virus, the virus multiplies in the animal's body and can be isolated from the blood within a few days after injection). Other mosquitoes or insects that bite the infected animal will also be infected by the virus. By analogy, many mosquitoes may be infected, which may start an epidemic.

    How to Prevent

    With the above understanding, let's talk about the prevention of epidemic encephalitis. According to our current understanding, mosquitoes are a possible vector for transmitting encephalitis, and animals may be the main factor in helping encephalitis spread. Without mosquitoes or other insects, encephalitis would not spread. But without animals, there would be fewer mosquitoes infected, and the epidemic would not occur. Even if it does occur, there would only be a limited number of cases, because humans are different from animals, and mosquitoes have fewer opportunities to bite humans than to bite animals. Since mosquitoes (or other biting insects) and animals may be the two major culprits of the encephalitis epidemic, to prevent the encephalitis epidemic, we should start with these two aspects: 1. Eradicate mosquitoes (and other biting insects); 2. Handle animals that are susceptible to encephalitis infection. In addition to this, we also have passive resistance methods, such as personal hygiene and vaccination. When it comes to animal handling, because we still don't know which animal is the factor in the start of the encephalitis virus epidemic, this still requires more research from the laboratory. However, according to the current understanding, if we use insecticides (such as DDT) or mosquito repellents for some suspicious animals, such as chickens, ducks, pigs, horses, etc., before the encephalitis epidemic occurs, we can also reduce the chances of animals being infected and transmitting the virus to mosquitoes, which can indirectly reduce the epidemic of the disease. Also, during the epidemic period, we, especially children, should stay away from animals, so that insects that bite animals will have fewer opportunities to bite us, which may reduce the chance of getting sick. Finally, let's talk about the issue of vaccination. Encephalitis vaccine can also prevent humans and animals from being infected by the encephalitis virus, but currently we have neither determined the type of encephalitis nor have a vaccine available, so vaccination is out of the question now. We plan to manufacture encephalitis vaccine, and we may have a vaccine available by next year when there is another epidemic. However, encephalitis vaccine is very effective for children, but only more than 50% effective for adults. Also, vaccine manufacturing is not as easy as smallpox vaccine, so even if we have a vaccine in the future, it will not be possible to apply it as widely as vaccination or cholera and typhoid fever vaccination. In fact, it is not necessary to do so, because most adults already have immunity and do not need vaccination. The only two types of people who really need vaccination are: 1. Children under the age of ten; 2. Adults who lack immunity – especially people who have just come from non-encephalitis epidemic areas, should be vaccinated. In short, epidemic encephalitis is a terrible enemy that directly threatens our life and health. We must pay special attention to it. On the one hand, we must rely on the correct leadership of the people's government, and on the other hand, we must also do our best to assist the government and health institutions, and work together to eradicate our common enemy. We believe that we may achieve this goal in a few years.

　　怎样预防流行性脑炎
    先农坛卫生实验院  黄祯祥
    流行性脑炎的重要性大家都知道了，可是怎样才能把这个病扑灭，怎样才能使大家得到保护，不害这种病呢？这就是下面我们要提出来同大家讨论的问题。以前反动政府对疾病的预防向来是不注意的，研究和实地做疾病预防工作的人如果有建议也是不会通过；即使通过了，也不会真正实行的，那不过是怕人民责难，敷衍一下。帝国主义国家对防疫工作表面上做得不错，可是他们底目的是为的保护资产阶级。现在的政府是人民的政府，是真正为人民服务的。这次北平一带脑炎流行，一开始，人民政府的卫生当局就非常注意，多少次的召集专家们讨论怎样扑灭这个病的问题，并且实地负起了领导责任，积极的救治患者，扑灭蚊子，并通令各处卫生机构，做各种调查与研究。所以现在我们有绝对的信心，在我们人民政府的正确领导下，医疗卫生界的人团结起来，加上人民的合作，大家共同努力，不久的将来，就能扑灭这个可怕的疾病。
    几个先决问题
    谈到流行性脑炎的预防，有几个先要解决的问题：第一我们应知道北平一带流行的脑炎属于何型？第二我们应知道该病流行的状况如何？第三我们应知道该病是怎样传染的？该病病原的宿主在那里？对这几个问题先要有充分的明了，我们才能谈到彻底扑灭这个病的预防问题。
    型别问题
    脑炎是由病毒传染致生的，无论那一种病毒侵犯到脑组织细胞并对该细胞有损害的现象，即能致生脑炎。脑炎的种类很多，有的发生在夏季，有的则发生在冬季，如昏睡性脑炎（又称甲型流行性脑炎）就是在冬季发生。而在夏天流行的脑炎却有很多种：１、日本乙型脑炎；２、圣路易型脑炎；３、马脑脊髓炎——又有数种型别；４、苏联型脑炎；５、其他型别。另外不属于此类的还有脊髓灰白质炎、狂犬病、新城鸡瘟所致的脑炎以及病后或接种疫苗后所得的脑炎也可以在夏季脑炎流行的季节发现。有的脑炎可以由临床的症象来断定属于何型，例如狂犬病及脊髓灰白质炎，可是有时候如同脊髓灰白质炎，我们无法单靠临床症象来断定型别，要确定一种脑炎属于何型，需要有实验室的检验。实验室的检验目前有两种方法：一、由死亡脑炎患者的脑组织分离病毒，然后再鉴定该毒属于何型；二、由脑炎患者血清免疫体（抗体）种类的鉴别——补体结合试验及中和试验——来鉴定型别。这两项检验工作，我们（卫生实验院传染病研究室）都已经开始做了，不过目前还没有完全确定结果，我们相信不久就可以将结果报告给大家的，不过现在我们可以推测北平夏季流行的脑炎可能大多数是属于日本乙型，因为：一、一九三六到一九四一年在北平协和医院本人和另外几位同道曾用血清鉴定法证明该时期北平夏季流行的脑炎大多属于日本乙型；二、一九四一年另有一位曾由一个死亡患者脑组织分离出一种病毒，经过中和试验证明属于日本乙型。
    流行的情形
    下面我们要谈到脑炎流行的状况，病毒传染的媒介，病毒怎样过冬，流行怎样起来以及预防的问题，这些问题的讨论都是假定北平流行的脑炎是属于日本乙型。在一九三六年以前北平就有夏季脑炎的病例，其后经过实验室的证明，是属于日本乙型，才开始引起临床医家的注意。我们可以说，在北平市每年夏天脑炎都有大小不等的流行发生，去年我们曾根据北平市几个大医院的病案做过一次统计，一九四八年患者一百四十五人，死亡率占百分之五十二点九，发病季节七月占百分之十一点七，八月占百分之七十三点一，九月份占百分之十五点二，所有患者除军队以外，其余的患者之中，十岁以下的儿童占百分之四十八点八，今年夏天根据卫生局及军队之统计北平及其四郊到本月六日为止共有患者一百九十人，死亡率约占百分之五十，所有患者除军队外，其余患者之发病季节七月占百分之六点五，八月占百分之七十九点八，九月占百分之十三点七，患者除军队都是成年人以外，其余的患者之中十岁以下的儿童占百分之五十二强，为什么儿童患脑炎的特别多呢，主要是儿童血内缺少免疫体，根据日本及美国几个专家研究的报告，日本及朝鲜脑炎流行地区正常人血清有百分之八十五以上含免疫体，一至三月的婴儿大多数含有免疫体——由有免疫体之母亲得来的，三月以后婴儿有免疫体的就减少很多，到一岁至三岁时差不多所有儿童都没有免疫体，四岁以上的儿童血内含免疫体的又慢慢增加，再看今年北平市郊区的病例，本地人害病的都是儿童，成年人多是由非流行区来平的军人，据统计北平市的儿童约占全人口的百分之二十，如果我们认为有免疫力的人不会得病，而所有得病的都是血里不含免疫体的人，那末由统计学的分析，根据城里每年患者之中其成年人组之发病率与十岁以下儿童组之发病率来比较，北平市成年人当有百分之八十以上有免疫力，市郊成年人可能近于全有免疫力，此种计算自然还是推测，不过此种推测是可以由中和试验来证明的，中和试验我们是计划要做，唯目前受动物数量的限制，还不曾开始。在抗战胜利以后美国赛宾氏曾由天津及上海十七岁以上的成年人（各十几例）取血做中和试验，据报告百分之八十五以上血清含有抵抗日本乙型脑炎的免疫体，这样看来北平成年人也可能百分之八十五左右有免疫能力，剩下的百分之十五左右无免疫力量的才会害病，那么脑炎很可能的在北平不会有大的流行发生，而我们对他也就不必过分害怕了。可是为什么大多数的成年人对日本乙型脑炎会有免疫力的呢？这大半是经过不显性的感染得来的，在日本及朝鲜流行地区的动物如马、牛、羊、狗、猪、鸡、鸭等血内多数含有免疫体，可能也是由于不显性感染的缘故，可见这个病的流行是很广泛的。
    传播病毒的媒介是什么？
    苏联、日本及美国的医学专家们认为日本乙型脑炎病毒的传播最可能的媒介是蚊子，因为：一、当脑炎流行时，该病毒可以由蚊子身上分离出来；二、用动物试验也可以证明蚊子可以将病毒传染给小白鼠及猴子，因为实验上不可能用人做脑炎试验所以到现在还没有确实证明蚊子是该病传染给人的媒介；虽然如此，但由以上的动物实验目前医学专家们还是认为蚊子是最可能传染给人的媒介。除蚊子外，还有扁虱（八角子，苏联科学家米玛可证明其可在动物实验上传染该病毒）。这样看来可能还有别的昆虫也是脑炎传染的媒介，特别是在动物的不显性感染方面。
    病毒怎样过冬？
    关于病毒过冬的问题，到现在我们还不知道，苏联及日本的医学专家曾查出受感染的蚊子可以将病毒传染到后代，不过此项工作尚需证明，在扁虱（八角子）苏联型脑炎病毒的传染后代是已经确实证明了的。动物是否长期宿主，到现在还没有人能够证明出来。
    流行怎样开始？
    根据各方面的报告，我们可以把他们集合来分析而推测到以下的最可能的流行开始之方式：譬如在七月初有一个受感染的蚊子咬了一个没有免疫力的动物，病毒即在该动物体内繁殖并循环在血里（用动物实验已证明鸡鸭及猪等动物经过病毒注射以后，病毒即在该动物体内繁殖，并在注射后几天内可以由血内将该病毒分离出来）其他的蚊子或昆虫咬到那个受感染的动物也将受到病毒的感染，以此类推，就可能有许多蚊子受感染，由此就可能开始一个流行了。
    怎样预防
    有了以上的认识，我们下面再谈谈流行性脑炎的预防，根据我们目前的认识，蚊子是传染脑炎可能的媒介，而动物可能是帮助脑炎流行的主要因素，没有蚊子或其他的昆虫，脑炎是不会流行起来的，可是没有动物，蚊子受感染的也会少，流行也不致发生。即使发生，也不过有限的几个病例，因为人与动物不同，蚊子咬人比咬动物的机会要少得多，既然蚊子（或其他咬人的昆虫）和动物可能是脑炎流行的两大罪魁，要预防脑炎的流行就应先由这两方面着手：一、扑灭蚊子（以及其他咬人的昆虫）；二、处理易受脑炎感染的动物。除这以外我们还有消极抵抗的办法，如个人卫生及预防注射。谈到动物的处理，因为目前我们还不知道那种动物是脑炎病毒开始流行的因素，这个还须要靠实验室方面多做研究，不过根据目前的认识我们如果在脑炎未流行的时期，对于我们上面所说的一些可疑的动物，如鸡、鸭、猪、马等，用杀虫药等（如滴滴涕）或驱蚊药，也可以减少动物受感染及将病毒传给蚊子的机会，这样间接也可以减少疾病的流行了。还有，在流行时期，我们，尤其是小孩，少同动物接近，咬动物的昆虫也就可以少有机会的咬我们，也许可以减少害病的机会的。最后我们再谈谈预防注射的问题，脑炎疫苗也可以预防人及动物不受脑炎病毒的感染，不过目前我们既没有确定脑炎的型别，也没有疫苗可用，所以在现在疫苗注射是谈不到的，我们是计划要制造脑炎疫苗的，大概明年再有流行我们可能有疫苗可用，不过脑炎疫苗对儿童效力很好，对成人则只有百分之五十以上有效，还有疫苗制造不象牛痘苗那样容易，所以将来就是有了疫苗，也不可能象种牛痘或打霍乱伤寒预防针那样普遍应用，实际上也不需要那样做，因为大多数的成人体内已有免疫能力，并无预防注射的需要，真正需要预防注射的，只有两种人：一、十岁以下的儿童；二、缺乏免疫力的成人——尤其是新由非脑炎流行区域来的人，应该注射疫苗。总之，流行性脑炎是直接威胁着我们生命健康的一个可怕的敌人，我们不能不对它特别注意，一方面我们要靠人民政府正确的领导，一方面我们自己也要尽力协助政府，协助卫生机构，大家共同努力，来扑灭我们大家的敌人，相信不几年间我们可能达到这个目的。
