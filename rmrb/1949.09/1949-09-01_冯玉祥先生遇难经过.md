The Course of Mr. Feng Yuxiang's Death
    Li Dequan

　　On July 31, 1948, we finally broke through the various obstructions of American imperialism and Kuomintang special agents in the United States and boarded the Soviet ship "Victory" to leave New York. There were eight people in our party: besides Mr. Feng and me, there were our three daughters, one son, eldest son-in-law, and Mr. Lai Yali.

　　Stepping onto the Soviet ship, we immediately felt that we had gone from a sinful world to a happy world. Exploitation, cruelty, and masks disappeared; people treated each other with frankness and sincerity, caring for and helping each other. The food was plentiful, and at night there were either musical evenings or movie screenings, or else dances under the moonlight. We, who had been oppressed for so long, were deeply moved once liberated, which is not surprising. Mr. Feng's poem "Little Swallow" was written under such circumstances.

　　After sailing for half a month, we arrived at the port of Alexandria on the northern coast of Egypt on August 15th, loaded with 1,500 Soviet expatriates returning home, and sent them to Batumi, a port on the eastern coast of the Black Sea in the Caucasus. On August 21st, the "Victory" left Batumi and crossed the Black Sea, heading for the port of Odessa. The next day, the wind was very strong. At about 1:00 PM, the young man in charge of showing movies on the ship was rewinding hundreds of reels of finished movie copies on the fourth lower deck. Due to the excessive speed during rewinding, friction caused a fire, igniting all the film reels. The fire was fierce and quickly spread to the exits on each floor along the wooden stairs. At this time, thick smoke billowed upwards. Mr. Feng and I were talking with our second and third daughters in the cabin when we saw black smoke coming out of the ceiling. The third daughter, Xiaoda, 19, ran towards the stairs like an arrow, and was engulfed by the flames and died. Mr. Feng left the cabin, and I found Mr. Feng's coat and followed him into the passageway. At that time, the passageway was dark and full of carbon monoxide gas. Although I heard Mr. Feng moaning, I was suffocated and could not say a word. Because the flames had burned my face and left hand, I struggled back to the room and lost consciousness. When my 18-year-old son Hongda rushed into the room and carried me out, I woke up. Then Mr. Lai, my eldest son-in-law, and my children all ran to rescue Mr. Feng from the cabin and immediately performed artificial respiration, but because of the long suffocation time, his older age, and a weak heart, it was impossible to save him. At this time, the entire ship was filled with flames. Mr. Lai and the children forced me to get into a lifeboat. During this critical period, although the Soviet friends also suffered some casualties, they still bravely rushed to rescue Mr. Feng's body and sent it to a small boat. I am very grateful for this responsible and selfless spirit. After the maritime officials on the shore learned of the fire on the "Victory," they immediately dispatched two warships to transport the stranded passengers back to Odessa, and on the way, they sent me and several other injured guests to a hospital on the Crimean Peninsula by speedboat for treatment. Lying in the hospital bed, I thought carefully that Mr. Feng's wish was to return to the liberated areas to participate in the people's democratic revolution. Although he unfortunately could not realize it due to accidental reasons, I also wanted to bring his ashes back to the liberated areas to fulfill his wish. Therefore, I decided to cremate Mr. Feng's body. On September 6th of last year, the Soviet government sent a special plane to take me from the hospital back to Moscow. The next day, two more special planes took Mr. Feng's remains, Mr. Lai, and my children to the Soviet capital. A ceremony was held at the airport to welcome the remains, and Mr. Feng's remains were immediately sent to the crematorium. Senior Soviet generals attended and presided over the cremation with solemn army etiquette. At that time, my injuries had not yet healed. I am sincerely grateful for the Soviet government's warm hospitality and treatment for my injuries. The Soviet Ministry of Education also allowed my three children and eldest son-in-law to study in the Soviet Union for free. I am sincerely grateful for this enthusiastic sympathy and help.

　　In order to participate in the revolution, I held Mr. Feng's ashes and left my children, returning to the motherland last November. I encouraged myself to follow in Mr. Feng's footsteps to complete his legacy. Although I am confident that my work in the past six months has been more exciting and meaningful than at any other time in my life, because I have lived in a backward environment for more than fifty years, I have not learned fast enough and have not progressed quickly enough. In the future, I can only work a hundred times harder, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, to contribute a small amount of strength to the people's democratic revolution and the construction of new democracy. I think this is the best way to commemorate my beloved Mr. Feng.

　　冯玉祥先生遇难经过
    李德全
    一九四八年七月三十一日，我们终于冲破了美帝国主义及国民党在美特务分子的百般阻挠，搭乘苏联轮船“胜利号”离开了纽约。一行八人，除冯先生和我以外，还有我们的三个女孩，一个男孩，大女婿和赖亚力先生。
    踏上了苏联的船，我们立刻感到是从一个罪恶的世界到了一个幸福的世界。剥削，残忍，假面具没有了；人们以坦白诚恳相见，互相照顾，互相帮助。饮食是丰盛的，夜间不是开音乐晚会便是放映电影，再不然便是在月光之下举行跳舞会。受压迫久了的我们，一旦解放，深受感动，自不足怪。冯先生的“小燕”诗，便是在这样心情之下写成的。
    舟行半月，于八月十五日抵埃及北岸的亚历山大港，装载了一千五百返国的苏侨，把他们送到黑海东岸高加索的海口巴统。八月二十一日“胜利号”离开巴统横渡黑海，向着奥德萨港进发。第二天，风很大，下午一时许，船上负责放映电影的青年在四层底楼正在倒回几百卷放完的电影拷贝，由于倒时速度太快，磨擦起火，引燃所有的胶卷，火势凶猛，顺着木制楼梯很快就烧到各层的出口。这时浓烟冲腾而上，冯先生和我在舱房里正同我们的第二第三两个女孩谈话，看见舱顶冒出的黑烟，三女十九岁的晓达便箭一般地向楼梯方向跑，被火焰卷去死难。冯先生随着离开舱房，我找着冯先生的大衣也跟着走进甬道。当时甬道黑暗无光，已充满了一养化炭的气体，我虽听见冯先生呻吟的声音，只是窒息得说不出一句话来。因为火焰已把我的脸和左手燃烧，我就挣扎着返回房中，已昏迷不省人事。等我十八岁的男孩洪达冲进房中，将我背出，才苏醒过来。接着赖先生、大女婿，和我的孩子们又一齐跑去将冯先生从舱房救出，并立即进行人工呼吸，但因窒息时间太长，年岁较大，心脏衰弱，已无法挽救。这时全船已火焰弥漫，赖先生和孩子们强迫我下了救生艇。在此危急时期，苏联朋友自己虽也有些伤亡但仍奋不顾身，把冯先生的遗体，抢送小船上。这种负责忘私的精神，我是非常铭感的。岸上海运官员知道“胜利号”失火之后，立即派两艘军舰将遇难旅客运回奥德萨，并在半途将我和另外几个受伤客人用快艇送到克里米亚半岛上一个医院里疗伤。我躺在病床上，仔细地想，冯先生的志愿是要回到解放区，参加人民民主革命，现在虽然不幸因为偶然的原因，不得实现，我也要把他的遗灰带回解放区来，以遂他的心愿。因此，我就决定将冯先生的遗体火葬。去年九月六日苏联政府派一架专机把我由医院接回莫斯科。第二天又派专机两架把冯先生遗体，赖先生和我的孩子们转到苏联首都。在飞机场举行了迎灵的仪式，并立即把冯先生遗体送到火葬场去。由苏联高级将领出席主持，并以隆重的陆军仪节举行了火葬。我当时伤势尚未痊愈，蒙苏联政府殷勤地招待我们，为我疗伤。苏联教育部并允许我的三个小孩和大女婿在苏联免费求学，对我这种热心的同情和帮助，我衷心十分感谢。
    为了参加革命，我抱着冯先生的骨灰，离开我的儿女，于去年十一月赶回祖国，我勉励要踏着冯先生的脚印完成他的遗志。我虽然自信半年多来的工作比我一生任何一个时期都更使我兴奋，感觉生活的更有意义；但由于我过去五十多年都生活在落后的环境当中，使我学习的还不够快，进步得还不够迅速。今后我只有更加百倍地努力，在毛主席和中共的领导之下，为人民民主革命，为新民主主义建设，尽一分小小的力量。我觉得这是纪念我敬爱的冯先生最好的方法。
