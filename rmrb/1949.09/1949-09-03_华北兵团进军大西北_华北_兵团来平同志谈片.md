　　The North China Corps Marches into the Northwest
  　—Comrade Lai Ping of the North China × Corps Speaks—
    Jin Feng
    After the North China People's Liberation Army Field Corps removed Taiyuan, the last stronghold in North China, it immediately obeyed the orders of the Party Central Committee and the Military Commission and marched into the Northwest.

    On the hundreds of miles of highway, the three columns stretched as far as the eye could see, advancing like flowing water. Bayonets gleamed dazzlingly in the sunlight, roaring mules and horses kicked up clouds of dust, cars sped by on the roads cleared by the people, large and small banners of various colors fluttered in the air, and songs stretching for miles rose and fell, converging into a magnificent torrent.

    The large corps crossed the river in two routes. When the vanguard troops arrived at Fenglingdu, the rear troops had not yet departed from Taiyuan. In June, the sun scorched the ground, and the soldiers were drenched in sweat, carrying equipment weighing forty or so pounds; from Taiyuan to Xi'an, a thousand-mile march, blisters rose on their feet, and when the blisters broke and bled, the soldiers clenched their teeth and overcame the difficulties with the determination to "carry out the revolution to the end and be glorious to the end." The entire army launched a large-scale mutual aid movement. Cadres took the lead, vying to carry weapons and backpacks for the soldiers. A certain battalion instructor carried twenty pounds of burdens for the cooks every day during the march. The soldiers also helped each other, highly developing class love.

    The troops proposed learning the spirit of the legendary Yu the Great, who passed his home three times without entering. New and old soldiers all set their own plans and launched a revolutionary competition. The newly liberated soldier Hou Qingliang, whose home was in Yuci, resolutely refused to return home even though he had just gotten married when the troops passed by his home. A certain company's deputy company commander, fearing that passing by his home would delay the march, covered his face with a large mask and goggles to avoid encountering acquaintances. Many soldiers quietly slipped past their homes without saying a word. In one battalion of a certain regiment alone, more than thirty comrades managed to pass their homes without entering. The soldiers all gave a thumbs up and said, "We have so many Yu the Greats!"

    The send-offs and welcomes from the people along the way were particularly touching. In the North China liberated areas, along the Fen River to the Yellow River, for hundreds of miles, boiling water stations and reception stations were set up in every village. Liberated peasants rushed to carry luggage, liberated peasant women rushed to wash clothes, and children followed the soldiers singing all the way. Everywhere the army passed, there were send-off lines, gongs and drums were played, and banners fluttered, making it extremely lively! Colorful arches were erected along the highway, with slogans written on them: "Advance bravely and annihilate the Hu bandits!" "Liberate the Northwest and liberate all of China!" The troops who won the title of "Pioneer in Attacking Yuncheng and Scaling the City Walls" were sent off by the residents of Yuncheng, who rushed to make ninety banners overnight when they passed through Yuncheng this time. The send-off lines stretched from outside the North Gate to the West Gate. After the troops crossed the Yellow River and entered the Guanzhong area, slogans such as "Welcome to the North China Corps" and "Salute to the North China Corps from afar" were posted in every town and village. The welcoming people constantly asked, "Comrades, you've worked hard!" "Comrades, we've been waiting for you!" Firewood and grain had already been prepared, and road signs were erected at major road junctions, indicating the nearby villages and the number of households, how many houses and how many *kangs* (heated platforms), and how many troops could be accommodated. Red paper strips were pasted on the doors of each household in the village: "Welcome the North China Army to be stationed here."

    The people's enthusiastic send-offs and welcomes were due to their extreme hatred for the Kuomintang bandit troops and their immense gratitude to the People's Liberation Army. The people sending off belonged to the Jinzhong and Jinnan areas of the North China liberated area, which were liberated last year. Last year, the Linfen area of southern Shanxi was devastated by the Yan Xishan bandit troops, leaving the fields barren. This year, when the army passed by again, it was a scene of good crops. The people of Guanzhong in the Northwest have suffered greatly from the ravages of the Hu Ma bandit troops: conscripting laborers, conscripting husbands, conscripting livestock, levying grain, levying money, robbing property, robbing clothes, raping women, and abducting children, causing countless families to be ruined. As the North China Army passed through, it received many tearful accusations from the residents: at a send-off rally, Han Hengcai's wife from Pucheng shed tears, crying that her eight-year-old daughter had been abducted and raped to death by the special service battalion of the 5th Regiment of the Hu bandit army; at the welcome rally at Weinan Station, fifteen-year-old Chen Yue personally accused that his mother was beaten and had her leg broken by the Hu bandit army when she chased after the ox cart pulled away by the Hu bandit army, and died of her injuries; when the troops passed through Guanmenzi, an old man selling sour apricots waved his tears and told that his younger sister was dragged away and raped to death by the bandit army, and his sister's husband was severely beaten for several days after rushing to the bandit army headquarters, and finally left in the mountains to be eaten by wolves;... These blood-stained deeds made the Northwest people have an irreconcilable hatred for the Hu Ma bandit troops, so even though they had just been liberated, they already felt that the People's Liberation Army was as close as their own relatives. And the enthusiastic send-offs and welcomes of these people deeply moved every commander and fighter of the North China Corps, and everyone expressed that they must realize the hopes of the Northwest people: "Quickly eliminate the Hu Ma bandits and avenge the suffering Northwest people!"

    On their march, they heard that the Hu Ma bandit troops were妄想 (attempting presumptuously) to return to attack Xi'an. The soldiers were both angry and happy. They were happy that "the opportunity for a feast has arrived!" Everyone regarded annihilating the Hu Ma bandits and winning a great victory as enjoyable as a "feast." The soldiers said, "The meat is at the mouth, give the order, I have no worries, I am only afraid that the enemy will run away." The fighting spirit was like ten thousand horses galloping. One division of the vanguard troops marched urgently for four consecutive days, traveling more than one hundred *li* (Chinese mile, about 0.5 km) a day. They rushed to Xi'an, passed through the city, and all the residents of the city came to watch and welcome the well-equipped, well-armed, and highly motivated People's soldiers who had traveled thousands of miles from North China to help, and the prices in Xi'an fell for a time.

    At that time, the Ma bandits were still arrogant and attacked near Xianyang. After a long march, the North China vanguard division arrived in Xianyang that night, and began fighting the next morning. With one division, they blocked the attack of six divisions of the Ma bandits. After a fierce battle for a day and a night, they killed and wounded more than 2,000 enemies. Our army suffered only more than 300 casualties, creating a ratio of one to seven in the results of battle. At that time, a company guarding the east of Xianyang City had defeated nine counterattacks by a regiment of Ma bandits, and held its position for a whole night, launching several hand-to-hand combats with the enemy, demonstrating their heroic spirit of fighting.

    Within a month, the troops of the North China Corps arrived on the Shaanxi battlefield in a steady stream and met with the old brother—the Northwest Field Army. Everyone learned from each other, visited each other, and cooperated in combat, and got along very harmoniously.

    Unified under the leadership of Deputy Commander-in-Chief Peng Dehuai, on July 12, they also cooperated with the Northwest old brother, blocking the Ma bandits' reinforcements on one route, and encircling them on three routes. With clever and brave actions, they surrounded the main force of the Hu Zongnan bandit troops in the Fufeng and Mei County area like an iron bucket, launching a fierce fire and a powerful attack, dividing the enemy into many small pieces. In less than two days and two nights, they eliminated four armies of the Hu bandits. Another part of the troops in the Mazhaozhen area annihilated two more enemy divisions, capturing more than 30,000 and killing and wounding more than 10,000. They also cooperated with the Northwest Corps and took advantage of the victory to liberate 19 cities and vast rural areas such as Baoji, Fengxiang, and Bin County; closely pursued and annihilated the Ma family bandit army, and liberated more than a dozen county towns such as Tianshui and Pingliang, the important towns of Gansu and the terminal of the Longhai Railway. The remnants of the Hu Ma bandit army were driven south and west. Now that they have cooperated with the Northwest People's Liberation Army to liberate Lanzhou, the spearhead is pointing at the old nest of the Ma family bandit army—Qinghai and Ningxia. The day of complete liberation of the Northwest is not far away. (Attached picture)

　　华北兵团进军大西北
  　—华北×兵团来平同志谈片—
    金凤
    华北人民解放军野战兵团，在拔除了华北最后一个据点太原以后，随即奉了党中央和军委的命令，挺进大西北。
    几百里的公路上，一眼望不尽的三路行列，流水似的前进。刺刀在日光下闪着耀眼的光，咆哮的骡马，踢起一股股的尘土，汽车在人们闪出的路上，疾驰而过，大的小的各色各样的锦旗，在半空中飘扬，绵延几里长的歌声，前后起伏着，汇成了雄壮的洪流。
    大兵团分两路渡河，当先头部队到了风陵渡，后面的部队还没有从太原开拔。六月天，太阳晒得地面烫脚，背着四十来斤重的装备，战士们浑身汗湿；从太原到西安，千里行军，脚上起了水泡，水泡磨破了出血，战士们抱着“革命到底，光荣到底”的决心，咬紧牙关克服困难。全军又掀起了大互助运动，干部以身作则，抢着跟战士背武器，背背包，某营教导员在行军途中每天为炊事员背二十斤的担子，战士们也你帮我让，高度发挥了阶级友爱。
    部队提出了学习传说中禹王三过其门而不入的精神。新老战士都订了自己的计划，展开了革命竞赛。新解放战士侯清亮，家在榆次，当部队经过他家的时候，他虽然刚刚结婚不久，但他还是坚决不回去。某连副连长怕路过家门时耽搁进军，就用大口罩和风镜，把脸遮住，避免碰见熟人。好多战士都是不声不响，溜过了自己的家门。仅某团一营，就有三十多个同志做到了过门不入。战士们都翘起大姆指说着：“咱们的禹王可真不少！”
    沿途人民的欢送与欢迎，是特别动人的。华北解放区沿汾河到黄河数百里的大道上，村村设立了开水站和招待站，翻身农民抢着挑行李，翻身农妇抢着洗衣服，儿童们一路跟着战士歌唱。只见大军过处，尽是欢送行列，锣鼓喧天，锦旗飘扬，好不热闹！沿公路扎着彩楼，上面写着：“奋勇前进，追歼胡匪”，“解放大西北，解放全中国”！荣获“攻运城登城先锋”的部队，这次过运城时，运城的居民连夜赶做了九十面锦旗，赶去欢送，欢送的队伍从北门外一直排到西门口。当部队渡过黄河进入了关中地区后，“欢迎华北兵团”，“向远道而来的华北兵团致敬”的标语，就遍贴在每个城镇乡村。欢迎的人民不断的问候：“同志们，辛苦啦！”“同志们，可把你们盼来啦！”柴草粮食早就筹划好了，大道要路口立起了指路牌，说明附近的村庄和户数，有多少房子多少炕，可供多少部队住宿。村里的各户门上贴着红纸条：“欢迎华北大军驻此”。
    人民如此热烈的欢送和欢迎，是由于他们对于国民党匪军的极端分恨及对于解放军的万痛感激。欢送着的属于华北解放区的晋中晋南的人民，是去年解放的。去年的晋南临汾一带，被阎锡山匪军糟踏得田园荒芜，今年大军再过时，已是一片好庄稼了。西北关中的人民则饱受了胡马匪军的蹂躏：拉丁、拉夫、拉牲口、派粮、派款、抢钱财、抢衣物、强奸妇女、拐走小孩，闹得老百姓家破人亡的不在少数。当华北大军一路过境时，就接受了居民不少血泪的控诉：在一个欢送大会上，蒲城的韩恒才的婆姨洒着两行热泪，哭诉着她八岁的女儿被胡匪军第五团特务营拐去强奸致死；渭南车站的欢迎会上，十五岁的孩子陈月亲控诉着他的母亲因追赶胡匪军拉去的牛车，被胡匪军打折了腿，伤重致死；部队经过关门子，卖酸杏的老汉又挥着眼泪，诉说着他的妹子被匪军拉去奸死，妹婿赶到匪军营部后被毒打了几天，最后丢在山沟里被狼咬死；……这些血泪斑斑的事迹，使西北人民对于胡马匪军，有着不共戴天的仇恨，因此虽然他们还是刚刚解放，对于解放军已感到是自己亲人一样亲了。而这些人民的热情的欢送和欢迎，又深深感动了华北兵团的每个指战员，大家纷纷表示一定要实现西北人民的希望：“赶快消灭胡马匪，为受难的西北人民报仇！”
    在他们行军途中，听说胡马匪军妄想回犯西安，战士们听了又是愤怒又是高兴，高兴的是，“会餐的机会到了！”大家把歼灭胡马匪打大胜仗，看作象“会餐”一样的痛快。战士说：“肉到嘴边了，下命令吧，我什么顾虑也没有，就怕敌人跑了”。战斗情绪有如万马奔腾，先头部队一个师，急连四天急行军，一天赶路一百多里，赶到西安，穿城而过，全城居民万人空＠来观看和欢迎这装备齐整，武器精良，战斗意志昂扬，不远千里从华北兼程赶来的人民子弟兵，一时西安物价也下跌了。
    当时马匪气焰还高，进袭咸阳附近，华北先头师在长途行军以后，当晚赶到咸阳，第二天早晨就开始战斗，以一个师堵住了马匪六个师的进攻，激战一天一夜，杀伤二千多敌人，我军伤亡只有三百多，造成了一比七的战果。那时守着咸阳城东的一个连，曾打垮马匪一个团的九次反扑，坚守阵地一个整夜，数次和敌人展开肉搏，显露了他们底战斗的英雄主义。
    华北兵团的部队，一个月内，源源到达了陕西战场，和老大哥——西北野战军见了面，大家互相学习、参观、配合作战，相处非常融洽。
    统一在彭德怀副总司令的领导下，七月十二日，他们又配合了西北老大哥，一路堵截住马匪的增援，三路包剿，用智巧勇敢的动作，把呆在扶风、眉县一带胡宗南匪军主力包围得象铁桶一样，展开了猛烈的火力和强大的攻击，把敌人分割成好多小块，仅仅打了不到两天两夜，就消灭了胡匪四个军。部队的另一部分在马召镇地区，又歼灭敌人两个师，总共俘虏了三万多，打死打伤一万多。又配合了西北兵团，乘胜解放了宝鸡、凤翔、彬县等十九个城市和广大乡村；紧紧追歼马家匪军，又把甘肃的重镇、陇海路的终点——天水和平凉等十几个县城解放。直打得胡马匪军残部南奔西窜，现在他们配合西北解放军解放兰州后，矛头正在指向马家匪军的老窝——青海和宁夏，全部解放大西北的日子已经不远。（附图片）
