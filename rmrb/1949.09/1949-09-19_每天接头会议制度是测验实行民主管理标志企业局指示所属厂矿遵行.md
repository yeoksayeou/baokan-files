[This City News] In order to implement the work plan for September and October and improve the democratization of factory management, the Beijing Municipal People's Government Enterprise Bureau recently issued instructions requiring all subordinate factories and mines to establish daily liaison meetings and technical work meetings for the heads of the Party, government, and labor union, starting from September 20. Regarding the liaison meetings, the instructions pointed out: whether this system is sound is a major indicator of testing the understanding and implementation of democratic management in factories. Currently, most factories and mines have not yet established this system; some have established it, but it is very incomplete. After the liaison meeting is established, the daily records should be used as one of the main contents of the telephone report for the next day.

Regarding the technical work meeting, the instructions pointed out: This type of meeting is specifically for studying how to improve technology and improve quality. It should be held by the technical leaders of the factory or mine, such as engineers, technicians, and foreman, and should also be led by administrative leaders, and Party and labor union leaders should be invited to participate. This type of meeting is best held once a month. Temporary meetings can also be held in case of temporary projects. The instructions also stipulated that the monthly engineering plan of each factory must be signed and sealed by the military representative, factory director or manager, and also by the engineer or main technical person in charge.

　　每天接头会议制度是测验实行民主管理标志企业局指示所属厂矿遵行
    【本市讯】北平市人民政府企业局为贯彻执行九、十月份工作计划，健全工厂管理民主化，特于日前发出指示，要求所属各厂矿自九月二十日起建立党、政、工三方面负责人每天的接头会议与技术工作会议。关于接头会，指示指出：这个制度的健全与否，是测验对工厂民主管理的认识与实行的一个主要标志。目前各厂矿还没有建立起这个制度；有的虽已建立，但也很不健全。接头会建立后，并要将每天的纪录作为第二天电话汇报的主要内容之一。
    关于技术工作会议，指示指出：这种会议是专门研究如何改进技术，提高质量的。由厂矿内工程师、技师、技工长或领班等技术负责人开会，同时也要有行政负责人领导，并邀请党、工负责人参加，这种会议最好每月开一次。遇有临时工程，并可开临时会议。指示并规定：各厂每月工程计划除军事代表、厂长或经理签名盖章外，工程师或技术主要负责人也要签名盖章。
