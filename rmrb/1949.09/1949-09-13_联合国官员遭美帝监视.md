Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 12th: TASS, The Hague: The Dutch Communist Party newspaper, *De Waarheid*, recently reported on the persecution of UN officials by the U.S. authorities, stating that the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation, which recently established a branch in the Netherlands, is expanding its activities and attempting to control officials of the UN Secretariat. Recently, a certain official holding an important position in the UN Secretariat complained in a conversation with a close friend that the atmosphere at Lake Success had become very tense. The work of the UN Secretariat officials has been greatly hampered as a result of the attacks by the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee and the persecution by the U.S. police and the FBI. Although UN officials enjoy diplomatic rights, they are frequently obstructed in every possible way. The aforementioned official said that the U.S. State Department is deeply displeased with the activities of the UN Secretariat. Not long ago, the U.S. State Department instructed the FBI to compile a list of UN officials who were dissatisfied with the U.S. authorities. According to Acheson's plan, these UN officials will be replaced in the future by candidates nominated by the FBI. In order to implement this measure, the FBI has placed the UN officials at Lake Success under special surveillance. The FBI is attempting to obtain "unfavorable" material on those who are dissatisfied with it, in order to subsequently declare them "undesirable elements." Many officials of the UN Secretariat have complained about being under surveillance. The newspaper wrote that Americans working in the UN Secretariat treat staff of other nationalities with an arrogant and conceited attitude, and intimidate those who are willing to remain neutral.

　　联合国官员遭美帝监视
    【新华社北平十二日电】塔斯社海牙讯：荷共真理报顷报道美国当局迫害联合国官员的情形称：最近在荷兰建立分处的美国联邦调查局，正在扩大它的活动，并企图控制联合国秘书处的官员。最近有一个在联合国秘书处担任重要职位的某官员，在与他的密友谈话中抱怨说：成功湖的气氛已变得很紧张了。联合国秘书处官员的工作，由于美国参院司法委员会的攻击，和美国警察及联邦调查局迫害的结果，已大大地受到阻碍。虽然联合国官员获有外交权利，但他们时常在每种可能的形式下受到阻挠。上述官员曾说，美国国务院对联合国秘书处的活动深表不悦。不久以前，美国国务院曾训令联邦调查局编制为美国当局所不满意的联合国官员的名单。依照艾奇逊的计划，这些联合国官员将来要由联邦调查局所提名的候补人所顶替。联邦调查局为了实行这一措施，已将成功湖的联合国官员们置于特别监视之下。联邦调查局企图获得对它不满意的人们“不利”的材料；以便嗣后发表他们为“不良分子”。联合国秘书处的许多官员，已经对他们受人监视一事发出怨言。该报写道：在联合国秘书处工作的美国人，以一种高傲自大的态度对待其他国籍的工作人员，并对那些愿守中立的人们施以恐吓。
