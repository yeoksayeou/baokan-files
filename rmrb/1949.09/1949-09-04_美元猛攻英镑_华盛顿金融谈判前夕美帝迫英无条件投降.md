Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 2nd: Moscow Dispatch: The "Pravda" recently published an article by Viktorov entitled "The Dollar's Offensive Against the Pound Sterling," commenting on the upcoming Anglo-American financial negotiations in Washington. The author points out that the preparations for the negotiations are being carried out in an atmosphere characterized not only by sharp arguments and mutual recriminations in the American and British press but also by extreme pessimism on the part of both London and Washington regarding the prospects for the negotiations. This pessimistic tone gives us a clear idea of the extent to which the sharp contradictions between the United States and Britain have developed.

　　The contradictions between the United States and Britain are clearly manifested in the struggle between the dollar and the pound sterling. The characteristic of this struggle is that American capital is launching a resolute offensive against the main positions of the pound sterling bloc led by Britain. Britain's American partner is stubbornly trying to devalue the pound sterling, smash the entire pound sterling bloc, and establish the unique dominance of the dollar, thereby greatly expanding the market for American goods and freeing itself from the threat of crisis, or at least weakening its impact. As is well known, the first resolute conflict between the pound sterling and the dollar occurred this summer due to the expiration of the so-called European internal clearing method, that is, the agreement on the clearing method between the Western European Marshall Plan countries. At that time, the United States demanded that multilateral agreements replace bilateral agreements, requiring the establishment of so-called free competition in trade and the abolition of the principle of non-free convertibility of currencies. In the course of protracted negotiations, Britain made some concessions, so a temporary agreement was reached. However, the solution to the problem was postponed until autumn, so Anglo-American negotiations will be held in Washington. Of course, the problem is not limited to the internal clearing system in Europe. The point of contention is serious, and now even more so.

　　The failure of the Marshall Plan is now quite obvious; it will not fulfill the wishes of either the United States or the Marshallized countries. Britain is rapidly and disastrously depleting its gold and foreign exchange reserves. For this reason, Britain is bypassing the Marshall Plan and beginning to conclude bilateral agreements with the United States, settled in pound sterling. It is not difficult for us to understand that this move naturally aroused the fury of the American ruling class. The United States immediately took retaliatory measures and strongly increased its pressure on the Marshallized countries, especially Britain. The United States even threatened Britain that if it continued to engage in bilateral agreements that discriminated against American goods, it would lose Marshall Plan loans.

　　What are the intentions of both the United States and Britain in the Washington negotiations? British press commentary clearly shows that Wall Street is demanding unconditional surrender from London, completely and finally subordinating British policy and economy to the United States. What is Britain's position? Judging from British press commentary, Britain is attempting to broaden the scope of the problem, attempting to lead the negotiations out of the scope of purely financial issues. British newspapers pointed out that on the issue of pound sterling devaluation, Bevin takes a "more flexible" stance than Cripps and is prepared to make significant concessions in exchange for more substantial military aid from the United States.

　　Regardless of the outcome of the Washington negotiations, and regardless of who benefits more from the mutual blackmail, these negotiations will not resolve the increasingly deepening contradictions between the United States and Britain and cannot prevent the continued aggravation of this contradiction.

### 美元猛攻英镑　华盛顿金融谈判前夕美帝迫英无条件投降

　　美元猛攻英镑
  　华盛顿金融谈判前夕美帝迫英无条件投降
    【新华社北平二日电】莫斯科讯：真理报顷刊载维克托罗夫的专文，题为“美元对英镑的攻势”，评论即将开幕的华盛顿英美金融谈判。作者指出，谈判的准备工作，是在这样一种气氛中进行的，这种气氛的特征，不仅在于美英两国报纸的尖锐争论及相互詈骂，而且在于伦敦及华盛顿方面对谈判的前景均表示极大的悲观。这种悲观的论调，给我们一个清楚的概念，即美英之间尖锐的矛盾已发展到了怎样的程度。
    英美间的矛盾，在美元及英镑之间的斗争中很明显地表现出来。这个斗争的特色，是美国资本对英国领头的英镑集团的主要阵地发动坚决的攻势。英国的美国伙伴，顽强地力谋使英镑贬值，打烂整个的英镑集团，并建立美元国家独一无二的统治，从而大大地扩张美货的市场，为自己免除危机的威胁，或至少减弱危机的影响。如众所周知，英镑及美元第一次坚决的冲突，于今夏因所谓欧洲内部清算方法，亦即西欧马歇尔化国家间清算方法的协议期满而发生。那时，美国要求应以多边协定代替双边协定，要求建立所谓贸易的自由竞争并废止货币不能自由兑换的原则。在迁延甚久的谈判中间，英国作了某些让步，故达成了暂时的协定。但是，问题的解决仍被延至秋季，因此，美英谈判将于华盛顿举行，当然，问题并不限于欧洲内部的清算制度。争执点是严重的，而现在则更为严重。
    马歇尔计划的失败，现在已经十分明显，它不会实现美国或马歇尔化国家任何一方的愿望，英国正在迅速而灾难地耗竭它的黄金及外汇储备。因此之故，英国正绕过马歇尔计划，开始缔结以英镑结算的、针对美国的双边协定。我们不难了解，这一举动当然引起美国统治阶级的暴怒。美国立即采取了报复的措施，并强烈地增强其对马歇尔化国家的压力，特别是对英国，美国甚至威胁英国，如果它继续进行歧视美货的双边协定，那末它将失去马歇尔计划的贷款。
    美英双方在华盛顿谈判的打算是怎样呢？英国报刊的评论清楚地显示，华尔街要求伦敦无条件地投降，将英国的政策和经济完全并最后地从属于美国。英国方面的立场怎样呢？自英国报刊的评论判断，英国企图扩大问题的范围，企图将谈判引出纯粹金融问题范围之外。英国报刊指出，在英镑贬值问题上，贝文较克利浦斯采取“较为弹性”的立场，并准备作巨大的让步，以换取美国更大量的军事援助。
    不管华盛顿谈判的结果如何，也不管谁在相互敲诈中得益较多，这次谈判将不能解决美英之间日益深刻化的矛盾，并不能阻止这个矛盾的继续严重化。
