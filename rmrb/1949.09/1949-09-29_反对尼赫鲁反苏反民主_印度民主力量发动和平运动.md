Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 28th: According to a statement made here recently by Yashikar, representative of the All-India Trade Union Congress to the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress, the heroic city of Calcutta—a place where working people and intellectuals have repeatedly engaged in heroic struggles—will be the location of the All-India Peace Conference scheduled for November. The decision to hold the conference was made by the All-India Trade Union Congress at a preparatory meeting held in Bombay on September 9. Indian democratic forces initiated the organization of a mass peace movement after Nehru's police and the army of Assam launched a barbaric attack on the peace conference held in Dibrugarh on July 17. On that day, eight participants in the conference (including an 18-year-old farmer) were killed, and hundreds were seriously injured. Members sent to attend the Bombay preparatory meeting also included various progressive democratic groups of writers, artists, students, women, and youth, such as the All-India Student Federation, the All-India Society for Soviet Friends, the All-India Progressive Writers Association, the Indian People's Theatre Association, and the Progressive Journalists Association of Kolar (Malabar District, Madras Province). The preparatory meeting called on all democratic groups to ensure that the broadest possible commemorative ceremonies are held on October 2, International Day of Struggle for Peace, and November 7, the anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution, as part of the preparations for the All-India Peace Conference. In the mass rallies and demonstrations on these two days, the Indian people will express their solidarity with peace fighters around the world and their determination to fight against the anti-Soviet and anti-democratic policies of the Nehru government.
