The Municipal Women's Federation
　　Organizes Thousands of Women to Produce and Wash Military Uniforms, Saving 200 Million

[Reported by this newspaper] The Preparatory Committee of the Beijing Municipal Women's Federation recently organized approximately one thousand women in seven districts within the city to contract for the washing, dismantling, and cotton-padding work of over 40,000 sets of uniforms for the Public Security Bureau. It is expected that the work will be completed in two weeks to twenty days, with districts 1, 4, 8, 11, and 12 already having commenced work. The Production Department of the Municipal Women's Federation previously held a cadre mobilization meeting, emphasizing that the significance of this work lies not only in implementing the resolutions of the All-Circles Representative Conference and organizing women's production, but also in educating the masses and strengthening the relationship between the government and the people. On the 10th, a joint meeting of the heads of women's work groups from various districts was convened to report on the work and exchange experiences in mobilizing and organizing the masses. According to Yu Rongting, the head of the Production Section of the Public Security Bureau, reusing the old uniforms as lining after washing can save 200 million yuan, thereby reducing the burden on the people by 200 million yuan. He expressed the hope that the districts would learn from each other, ensure the completion of the task, and pave the way for women's production.

　  组织妇女千人生产拆洗军服省钱二亿
    【本报讯】北平市民主妇联筹委会最近在城内七个区组织了约一千个妇女承包公安局四万余套制服的拆洗和铺棉工作，准备在半个月至二十天完成，一、四、八、十一、十二等区已开工。市妇联生产部日前曾开过一次干部动员会议，着重说明这次工作的意义不仅在执行各界代表会议的决议，组织妇女生产，而且在教育群众，密切政民关系。前（十）日又召集各区妇女工作组负责人联席会，汇报工作，交流动员和组织群众的经验。据公安局生产科于荣廷科长谈，这次把旧制服拆洗好做里子可以节省两亿元，也就是减轻了人民两亿元的负担；希望各区互相学习，保证完成任务，为妇女生产开辟道路。
