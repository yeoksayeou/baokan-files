　　The North China People's Government Earnestly Cares for Disaster-stricken Farmers
　  Reduces and Exempts Agricultural Taxes in Disaster Areas
    Promulgates Measures for Reduction and Exemption, Instructs Thorough Investigation, Correct Estimation of Harvest, and Ensures Fairness and Reasonableness
    [This newspaper's dispatch] The North China People's Government, in order to take care of the lives of farmers in disaster areas, develop agricultural production, and reduce the burden on farmers in disaster areas, promulgated the "Interim Measures for Reduction and Exemption of Agricultural Tax in Disaster Areas of the North China Region" on the sixth of this month, ordering the provinces and municipalities of North China to implement it. According to Article 4 of the reduction and exemption standards stipulated in the measures: (1) A reduction of 20% will be granted for crop failures of 20% or more but less than 30%; (2) A reduction of 30% will be granted for crop failures of 30% or more but less than 40%; (3) A reduction of 40% will be granted for crop failures of 40% or more but less than 50%; (4) A reduction of 50% will be granted for crop failures of 50% or more but less than 60%; (5) A reduction of 80% will be granted for crop failures of 60% or more but less than 70%; (6) Complete exemption will be granted for crop failures of 70% or more; (7) No reduction or exemption will be granted for crop failures of less than 20%. Article 7 of the measures states: (1) For continuous crop failures for two years with an average of 40% or more, the reduction and exemption will be increased by 10% according to Article 4; (2) For continuous crop failures for two years or more with an average of 50% or more, the reduction and exemption will be increased by 20% according to Article 4. The number of crop failure percentages mentioned in the articles refers to the percentage of crop yield reduction due to disaster for the entire agricultural season on all the land of the disaster-stricken household, compared to the normal expected yield. Land where crop harvests exceed the general yield due to active labor and intensive cultivation will also be calculated for reduction and exemption based on the normal expected yield. When implementing this reduction and exemption, the crop yield reduction due to disaster should be strictly separated from the crop yield reduction due to negligent farming. In order to make the disaster relief reduction fair and reasonable and to give play to the democratic spirit of self-reporting and public discussion, Article 9 of the measures stipulates: Disaster-stricken households should truthfully report the disaster situation to the village government, which will then investigate and evaluate it, and report it level by level to the higher-level government, which will send personnel to survey it before granting reduction and exemption according to regulations.
    [Another dispatch] This year's wheat harvest in the North China region was poor, and there has been more autumn rain, and some areas have also suffered from floods. In order to implement the "Interim Measures for Reduction and Exemption of Agricultural Tax in Disaster Areas of the North China Region," the North China People's Government has specifically instructed the provinces and municipalities to organize harvest surveys, instructing all localities that in implementing the government's reduction and exemption measures, on the one hand, it is necessary to thoroughly understand the burden situation in the disaster areas and overcome the past phenomenon of inaccurate surveys and improper reductions and exemptions, resulting in excessively light or heavy burdens. At the same time, it is also necessary to recognize that the remnants of domestic reactionaries have not yet been completely eliminated, the war is still going on, and the burden on farmers cannot be excessively reduced at present. Giving consideration to both the military and the people is still the basic principle of reducing and exempting agricultural burdens in disaster areas. Therefore, grasping the disaster situation and correctly estimating the harvest, so that truly disaster-stricken farmers can receive the due reduction and exemption care in the allocation of burdens, is the central key in today's reduction and exemption work. As the North China region is now actively carrying out the movement to promote production and provide disaster relief and save and prepare for famine, all localities must closely and appropriately combine disaster survey work with disaster relief work when implementing the reduction and exemption measures, so that disaster-stricken farmers can truly appreciate the government's earnest concern for them, recognize the current tasks, and bring their productivity to the highest level, in order to take care of the production and lives of farmers in disaster areas, while at the same time restoring and developing production, and doing a good job in reduction and exemption work.

　　华北人民政府殷切关怀受灾农民
　  减免灾区农业税收
    颁布减免办法指示深入调查正确估计年景做到公平合理
    【本报讯】华北人民政府为照顾灾区农民生活，发展农业生产，减免灾区农民负担，于本月六日颁布“华北区农业税灾情减免暂行办法”，通令华北各省、市政府执行。按该办法所规定减免标准第四条为：（一）歉收二成以上不到三成者减征二成；（二）歉收三成以上不到四成者减征三成；（三）歉收四成以上不到五成者减征四成；（四）歉收五成以上不到六成者减征五成；（五）歉收六成以上不到七成者减征八成；（六）歉收七成以上者，全部豁免；（七）歉收不到二成者不减免。办法第七条为：（一）连续二年歉收平均达四成以上者按第四条规定提高一成减免；（二）连续二年以上歉收平均达五成以上者按第四条规定提高二成减免。条文中规定的所指歉收成数系指灾户全部土地全年农作季节因灾歉收产量占常年应产量之成数而言，其因积极劳动，精耕细作，农作收获超过一般产量的土地，亦按常年应产量计算减免。执行该项减免时，应将因灾减收产量与因怠耕减收产量严格分开。为了使灾情减免做到公平合理，发挥自报公议的民主精神，办法第九条规定：受灾减免由受灾户据实向村政府申报灾情，再由村政府调查评议，逐级报上级政府派员勘查后再按规定给予减免。
    【又讯】今年华北地区产麦歉收，秋雨较多，某些地区又遭受水灾，华北人民政府为贯彻执行“华北区农业税灾情减免暂行办法”，特又指示各省、市政府组织年景调查，指示各地在贯彻政府减免办法中，一方面必须彻底了解灾区负担情况，克服过去调查不确，减免不当，造成负担畸轻畸重的现象，同时又必须认清今天国内反动派残余尚未全部歼灭，战争仍在进行，农民的负担目前尚不能作过分的减轻，军民兼顾仍是减免灾区农业负担的基本原则。因此，掌握灾情，正确估计年景，在分配负担中能使真正受灾农户得到应有的减免照顾，是今天减免工作中的中心关键。按现在华北各地正在积极开展生产救灾节约备荒运动，因此各地在贯彻减免办法时必须使勘灾工作与救灾工作密切适当的结合起来，使受灾农户真正体会到政府对他们的殷切关怀，认清当前任务，将生产力发挥到最高度，以便在照顾灾区农民生产生活中，同时做到恢复与发展生产，把减免工作做好。
