Martyrs' Remains to Be Transported
　　To begin after Autumn Harvest and Wheat Planting. Martyr's Coffins Generally Not Replaced. Editor:
　　I have something on my mind and would like you to answer it.
　　I had an older brother who was killed by bandits while working in the local area of Chabei in 1945. At the time, it was impossible to transport the remains. Now that all of North China has been liberated, my family wants to transport his remains back home. However, due to family poverty, and wanting the martyr to rest in peace, there are many problems that cannot be solved. Please answer: 1. When will the government allow the transportation to begin? 2. After so many years, the coffin must be rotten. If the coffin needs to be replaced during transportation, what are the government's regulations regarding the cost of the coffin? Can we contact the local democratic government where he was buried to receive the funds, what procedures are required, or what methods can be used to resolve this? 3. The cost of transportation is huge, and the family cannot afford it. Does the government have any solutions? 4. Is it free to use railways to transport the remains? In rural areas without railways, will the mobilization of civilian labor along the route still be used?
　　I believe this issue is of utmost concern to all families of martyrs. Please provide an answer in the newspaper as soon as possible.
　　A Reader, Han Heng. Editor Comrade:
　　My younger brother was a soldier in the People's Liberation Army and sacrificed his life in Baxian during the Pingjin Campaign in the winter of 1947. My family has long wanted to bring his body back to the ancestral grave, but the road is too far and the family's resources are insufficient. Now I hear that the People's Government can help with the transportation. I have a few questions, please answer: 1. I have a certificate of glorious sacrifice, where do I go to complete the procedures? 2. The coffin is damaged after so many years since the sacrifice, will it be replaced, and what are the procedures? 3. Can the government provide a vehicle to transport the remains to my home? 4. When can the transportation begin? Please answer immediately!
　　A Martyr's Family Member, Luo Yifeng. Comrades Luo Yifeng and Han Heng:
　　Regarding the questions you asked about the remains of martyrs and transportation methods, the answers are as follows:
　　1. Regarding the transportation of martyrs' remains, our government issued Order No. 30 (Youfu Zi) on April 25th, instructing all regions to postpone transportation temporarily. The main reasons were the large number of military transports and the busy farming season at that time. To avoid delaying the masses' production and to ensure public health, we considered the greater interests. Now that the weather is getting colder and the production season is coming to an end, the transportation of martyrs' remains can begin after the autumn harvest and wheat planting. 2. The martyrs' coffins have been properly buried by the troops after the battles, and generally will not be replaced. If other burial methods were used or the coffins have decayed beyond repair, a certificate from the district or village where the body is located must be obtained, and the local county government where the body is located must approve and be responsible for replacing the coffin with a simple one. The expenses will be paid from the local military preferential grain funds, but the maximum amount shall not exceed 300 Jin of millet. 3. When transporting martyrs' remains, in the future, porters will be hired for transportation, and the government will be responsible for reimbursing the transportation costs. The family members of the martyrs are responsible for their own travel expenses to and from the location. If individual families of martyrs are indeed having financial difficulties and cannot raise the funds themselves, the original county government may provide a subsidy based on the certificate from the district or village, but the maximum amount shall not exceed 30 Jin of millet (calculated at 1 Jin per day). In areas with trains and ships, they can be used for transporting the remains to the extent possible, but it is not necessarily free. As for the specific procedures, we are currently studying them and cannot provide a concrete answer at this time.

　　烈士灵柩起运
  　待秋收种麦后即可开始烈士棺木一般不再换发编者：
    我有点心事，请你给答复一下。
    我有一个哥哥，曾在一九四五年于察北作地方工作被匪军枪杀而牺牲，当时因情况无法起运，现在全华北都解放了，家中要往回起灵，但由于家庭贫困，又想使烈士安眠于地下，这里有许多问题不能解决请答复：１、政府何时才准予开始起灵；２、年限多了，棺材一定腐烂，在起运时要换棺材，这个棺材费，政府怎样规定，是否可从安葬之当地民主政府接洽领取，用什么手续，或用什么办法求得解决；３、路费巨大，家中无力负担，政府有无解决办法；４、在起运时，利用铁路运输灵柩是否免费，在没有铁路的农村运灵，是否还是沿站动员民力？
    这个问题我想凡是烈属都是最迫切关怀的，请你们很快在报上作答。
    一读者　韩珩编辑同志：
    我弟弟是个解放军人，在三十六年冬季平津保作战时在霸县牺牲，家中早想把他尸体起回去入祖坟，因路太远及家中力量不够，现听说人民政府能给起运，我有几个问题请解答：一、有光荣牺牲证明，到什么地方办手续；二、牺牲后到现在寿材坏了，是否给换，有何手续；三、运回时政府是否能给派车送到家中；四、何时能起运？请即答复！
    烈属　骆一峰骆一峰、韩珩二同志：
    关于所询有关烈士灵柩及启运办法等问题，兹分别解答如下：
    一、关于起运烈士灵柩，本府于四月二十五日优抚字第三十号曾通令各地暂缓起运，其主要原因是当时军运繁多与农忙时期，照顾到不耽误群众生产，注意大众卫生，从大的利益着想，现在气候渐冷，生产季节将要过去，烈士尸体待秋收种麦后，即可开始进行起运。二、烈士棺木业经部队于作战后妥为埋葬，一般不再换发，如有用其他埋葬或年久已朽确不能运回者，得经尸体所在区村证明，由尸体所在之当地县政府批准，并负责代换简便棺木，其经费由地方优军粮内开支，但最高不得超过小米三百市斤。三、起运烈士灵柩时，今后一律雇脚转送，运费开支后，由政府负责报销。烈属运尸时，本人往返所需盘费，均归自备。如有个别烈属家庭确实困难无力自筹者，经区村证明原籍县政府可酌情补助一部，但最多不得超过小米三十市斤（每日一斤计）。通火车与船运之地方，在可能范围内，运灵时均可利用，但不一定免费，至于用何手续，现下正在研究，尚无法具体答复。
