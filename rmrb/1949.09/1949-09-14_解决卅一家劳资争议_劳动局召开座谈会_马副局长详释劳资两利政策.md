    【This Municipality News】In order to smoothly resolve the disputes between labor and management in thirty-one enterprises across twenty-six industries, the Municipal Labor Bureau convened a symposium yesterday afternoon (the 13th), inviting relevant personnel from both sides to solicit opinions. After labor and management expressed their views on various issues arising from the disputes, Deputy Director Ma Guangdou of the bureau provided a general explanation based on the policy of developing production and benefiting both labor and management, addressing the issues raised by both sides. Deputy Director Ma first pointed out that the main reason for the current labor disputes is a lack of understanding or incomplete understanding of the People's Government's policy of "developing production and benefiting both labor and management." It is also due to the inevitable difficulties encountered during the transition from a semi-colonial and semi-feudal economy to an independent and autonomous New Democratic economy. Therefore, both labor and management must recognize friend from foe, think big, and seek mutual benefit from striving to develop production. Both sides should work together to overcome the difficulties of the transition period. If a dispute occurs, it should be resolved through consultation according to reasonable and legal procedures. Before a final resolution is reached, the current state of production should be maintained, and the management should not suspend meals, wages, or factory operations, nor take other actions that reduce benefits. The labor side should not engage in strikes or other actions that hinder production or violate labor discipline. Regarding the issue of dismissal, Deputy Director Ma explained that the government handles it based on the policy of "benefiting both labor and management and developing production." If the management has genuine difficulties due to production needs, it can dismiss workers, but if the workers and the union believe that the grounds for dismissal are not valid, they can protest. Deputy Director Ma also pointed out that some individual employers deliberately distort the policy to achieve the goal of dismissal, and even use divisive tactics to undermine worker unity and suppress active workers. These erroneous ideas should also be quickly corrected.

　　解决卅一家劳资争议
  　劳动局召开座谈会
　  马副局长详释劳资两利政策
    【本市讯】市府劳动局为使二十六个行业中三十一家劳资双方发生的争议问题，能获得顺利解决，特于昨（十三）日下午召集双方有关人员举行座谈会，征询意见。劳资双方对争议中所发生的各种问题发表意见后，即由该局副局长马光斗根据发展生产、劳资两利的政策与双方所提问题作概括的解释。马副局长首先指出目前发生劳资争议的主要原因是不了解或不彻底了解人民政府“发展生产、劳资两利”的政策，同时也由于从半殖民地、半封建经济转变到独立自主的新民主主义经济的过渡时期所遭遇的必然困难所致；因此劳资双方要认清敌友，从大处着想，从努力发展生产中求得两利，双方应同心协力克服过渡时期困难。如果发生争议时，应按照合理合法程序协商解决。在争议未获最后解决前，均应维持生产现状，资方不得有停伙、停资、停厂及其他减低待遇之处置；劳方不得有怠工或其他有碍生产及违犯劳动纪律之举动。关于解雇问题，马副局长说明政府是根据“劳资两利、发展生产”的政策来处理的，资方在因生产需要确有实际困难时，可以解雇工人，但工人和工会认为解雇理由不能成立，可以提出抗议。马副局长同时指出某些个别资方为达到解雇的目的，而故意曲解政策，甚至采用挑拨离间手段，破坏工人团结，打击工人积极分子，这些错误思想亦应迅速纠正。
