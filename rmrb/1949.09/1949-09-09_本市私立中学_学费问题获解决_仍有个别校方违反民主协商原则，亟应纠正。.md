This City's Private Middle School
  Tuition Issues Resolved
    Individual Schools Still Violate Democratic Consultation Principles and Urgently Need Correction.
    [This City News] Under the correct guidance of the Municipal Education Bureau in handling tuition issues for private middle schools, the tuition problems of most private middle schools in Beiping have been smoothly resolved. The tuition fees of most schools were jointly determined through democratic agreements between the school authorities and the students. Because the schools were able to consider the students' economic capabilities and gained the students' cooperation, all issues could be resolved through consultation based on a spirit of mutual care. For example, at Bei Man Girls' Middle School, a budget was prepared in advance before the end of the last semester, and tuition standards were set. Then, it was given to teachers, students, and parents for repeated discussions. At the school affairs meeting (composed of the principal, faculty, and student representatives), the school presented a detailed report on the budget. After considerable time for deliberation and discussion in groups, classes, and with parents, and with the consent of 97% of the students and parents, the tuition fee amount was determined. It was also stipulated that one-ninth of the students would be eligible for reductions or exemptions, and methods for reducing or exempting tuition for children of workers and peasants and students from poor families were established.
    The Second Branch of Xinsheng Middle School (formerly Zhicheng Middle School), with the sincere cooperation of the school and students, planned finances. When formulating the budget, the school and students carefully studied each item based on last year's expenditures, made a budget according to necessary expenses, and determined the tuition fees. The students were all satisfied and enthusiastically paid. The school's expenses for this semester are now guaranteed. At the same time, the students understood that "the school is their own," and they consciously cherished everything. The phenomenon of randomly destroying public property has quickly diminished.
    In addition, there are still individual school authorities who violate the principle of democratic consultation, which has led to student opposition and disputes. For example, the school authorities of Beining Midwifery School are still unwilling to correct the old practices left over from the Kuomintang. They neither publish the budget nor arbitrarily set high "draft" fees, forcing students to strictly comply and attempting to expel students who have not paid, thus causing disputes. This deserves the attention of the Beining Midwifery School authorities to promote a reasonable resolution to the dispute.

　　本市私立中学
  　学费问题获解决
    仍有个别校方违反民主协商原则，亟应纠正。
    【本市讯】在市教育局对处理私立中学收费问题的正确指导下，北平市各私立中学的学费问题大都获得了顺利的解决，大多数学校的学费都是经学校当局与学生间的民主协议而共同规定的，由于学校能照顾到学生的经济能力，取得了学生的合作，一切问题都能本着互相爱护的精神协商解决。如贝满女中，早在上学期结束前，预先作出预算，制定学费标准，然后交给教员、学生、家长反复讨论，在校务会议上（由校长、教职员及学生代表组成），由校方把预算作详细报告，然后经过小组、班上与家长相当时间的酝酿和讨论，并征得百分之九十七同学及家长的同意，而规定了学费数目，并规定设有九分之一的减免费数额，与对工农子弟及家境清寒学生的免减学费办法。
    新生中学第二院（原志成中学），在校方和同学精诚合作下，筹划经费，在制定预算时，校方和同学根据去年的开支，一项一项的详细研究，按照必要开支作出预算，规定学费，同学们都表满意，踊跃缴纳，该校本学期的开支已有了保证。同时同学们了解了“学校是自己的”，对于什么东西都自觉的爱护起来了，以往随意破坏公物的现象已很快的减少。
    此外，仍有个别学校当局，违反民主协商的原则，因此遭到学生的反对，并引起纠纷。如北宁助产学校的校方至今还不愿改正国民党遗留下来的旧作风，既不公布预算，又擅自规定高昂的缴费“草案”，强迫学生严格执行，并企图开除未缴费的学生，因此引起纠纷。这很值得北宁助产学校校方的注意，促使纠纷获得合理的解决。
