　　Special Invited Representative
  　Sa Zhenbing's Visit Report
    The China People's Political Consultative Conference specially invited General Sa Zhenbing, a veteran of the Fujian Navy, as a representative. On the 21st, he met with visiting reporters and made a statement. General Sa Zhenbing first said: I am too old and the journey is too far, so I cannot attend the CPPCC meeting, and have replied to the preparatory committee. But judging from this list of representatives, it is very obvious that Chairman Mao Zedong's political leadership is enlightened, and he can fairly accommodate democratic figures from all parties and all strata. As long as someone is useful for progress, they are considered national talents and are recruited as much as possible. On this point, we should express our respect to Chairman Mao. The reporter asked about the situation of the Navy under the rule of the Kuomintang, and his views on the Kuomintang's blockade of the sea. General Sa Zhenbing replied: The Kuomintang simply does not have the ability to manage warships. If you give them good warships, they will soon be destroyed. Especially now when they are in a complete collapse, they are even more unable to grasp the power of the navy. As for the issue of the sea blockade, judging from the victorious results of the People's Liberation Army's liberation of Changshan Island in the Bohai Sea and Pingtan Island in Fujian, the blockade will not last long. Finally, when the reporter asked about his views on the future liberation cause and the construction of a new China, General Sa Zhenbing replied in a firm tone: The Kuomintang bureaucrats mostly indulged in revelry day and night, disregarding the life and death of the people, while the People's Liberation Army is struggling hard at all times, and their living standards are even more frugal. This spirit of enduring hardship to serve the people alone has doomed the Kuomintang's total collapse and the People's Liberation Army's decisive and complete victory in the liberation cause. On the same basis, the task of developing economic construction in the future will also be completed smoothly. [Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 25th]

　　特邀代表
  　萨镇冰访问记
    中国人民政治协商会议，特别邀请代表之一福建海军宿将萨镇冰将军，于二十一日接见往访记者并发表谈话。萨镇冰将军首称：我年龄过高，且路途遥远，无法出席政协会议，已复电筹备会。但从这次代表名单看来，很显明的可以知道毛泽东主席主持政治的开明，处处能够公平地容纳各党派以及各阶层的民主人士，只要前进有用的人，便都认为是国家的人才，尽量罗致。此点，我们是应该对毛主席表示敬意的。记者询以国民党统治下的海军情形如何？对国民党封锁海口的见解如何？萨镇冰将军答称：国民党根本没有管理舰艇的本领，好好的战舰给他，不久就不毁自毁。尤其在现在全面崩溃时，更无法把握海军的力量了。至于海口封锁问题，从人民解放军解放渤海的长山岛与福建的平潭岛的胜利战果看来，封锁也是不会长久的。最后记者询以对于今后的解放事业与建设新中国的观感时，萨镇冰将军以坚决的口吻回答：国民党的官僚们，大多日夜花天酒地，不顾人民死活，而人民解放军则是无时无刻不在艰辛奋斗中，生活方面更为节省，单就这种吃苦为人民服务的精神，就注定了国民党的总崩溃的命运与人民解放军取得解放事业决定性的全面胜利。同样在此基础上，今后发展经济建设的任务，也必定可以顺利完成。　【新华社福州廿五日电】
