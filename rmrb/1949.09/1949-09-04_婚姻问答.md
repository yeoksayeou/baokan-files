Marriage Q&A

Mr. Wang Yi:

Regarding your inquiry about what constitutes legal divorce procedures for a married couple, I will briefly answer as follows:

According to the marriage laws and regulations of the People's Government, if both parties agree to a divorce, they must go to the judicial department of the government above the district level to complete the divorce procedures, which will only be valid after approval. According to the situation you described in your letter, only the parents of both parties provided proof and wrote agreements to each other; such divorce procedures are incomplete and will not be legally protected in case of future disputes.

Mr. Yang Jinmei:

If your husband has not fulfilled his obligations as a husband since your marriage eight years ago, and there is concrete evidence to prove this, you can file a lawsuit with the People's Court for a divorce and may also request a portion of alimony.

Mr. Liu Shimin:

The answers to your questions are as follows:

　　I. According to the marriage laws and regulations of the People's Government, if a couple's relationship is irreconcilable and they cannot live together, one party can file for divorce, and a divorce can be granted even if the other party does not agree.

　　II. If a couple's relationship is irreconcilable, regardless of which party files for divorce, if the woman has financial difficulties after the divorce, she shall be granted a portion of alimony based on the man's family's financial situation.

　　III. Regarding the set of quilts you mentioned that your family bought and was taken away by the woman, if this set of quilts was a gift from the man to the woman, it should be considered the woman's private property and she can take it with her.

专栏：询问与答复

　　婚姻问答王毅先生：
    所询夫妻离婚手续怎样才算合法的问题，兹简复如下：
    依据人民政府婚姻法令的规定，夫妻双方同意离婚，须到区以上政府司法部门办理离婚手续，经批准后才算有效。据你来信所说情形，只由双方家长证明，并互相立字为凭；这样的离婚手续是不完备的，将来发生纠纷在法律上得不到保障。杨金梅先生：
    你和你男人自结婚至今八年，男方既不尽其为夫的义务，如确有事实证明，可向人民法院起诉请求离婚；并可要求酌给一部分赡养费。刘士敏先生：
    所提问题分别答复如下：
    一、依据人民政府的婚姻法令，夫妻感情不合致不堪同居者，一方提出离婚，即使另一方不同意也可判决离婚。
    二、夫妻感情不合，不管任何一方提出离婚，于离婚后如果女方生活困难，得根据男方家庭经济情况，酌给女方一部赡养费。
    三、所说你家买的一套被子亦被女方拿去，如果这套被子是男方赠与女方的，应视为女方私有财产，可以带走。
