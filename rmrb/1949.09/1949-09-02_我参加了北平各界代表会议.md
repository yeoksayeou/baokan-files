　　I Attended the Beiping All-Circles Representatives Conference
    Fei Xiaotong
    The Beiping All-Circles Representatives Conference lasted for six days. For me, it was like attending six days of classes. What I learned in these six days surpassed what I had learned in the past six years, or even thirty years. The dream I had been pursuing for over thirty years was realized in these six days. What is this? It is democracy. I heard the word "democracy" very early on. During the May Fourth Movement, I was still a primary school student. But I didn't understand what a democratic society really was. From primary school to middle school, from middle school to university, I encountered student movements in every period. I followed along. Why? For democracy. But what exactly is democracy? I didn't understand. Without experience, how could I understand? When I grew up, I encountered the War of Resistance Against Japan. I returned from abroad when the war had already entered its second year, and the reactionary forces were already rising in the rear. Like many friends, I couldn't stand this situation. What to do? Demand democracy. But what exactly is democracy? Apart from book knowledge, I still didn't quite understand. Six years ago, I went to the United States to do cultural liaison work, and I began to study this question. Coming from under a reactionary regime to wartime America in the Roosevelt era, I indeed felt a difference in atmosphere. At this time, I came into contact with bourgeois democracy. This kind of democracy was much better than our feudal dictatorship at the time. I lived in the United States for a year and wrote a book called "First Visit to America." At that time, I thought I understood democracy, but upon further reflection, it didn't quite seem right. There were irreconcilable contradictions between democracy and capitalism. So I thought that the democracy I was pursuing was probably not entirely like this. A little over a year later, I had the opportunity to go to England. At that time, the Labour Party had just come to power, claiming to be a socialist country. So I hoped that in Labour's England, I could see the essence of democracy. The impression that postwar England gave me was indeed very deep. Coming directly from a region under bureaucratic capital rule and seeing an orderly rationing system, how could the impression not be deep? After living there for three months, I wrote another book: "Second Visit to Britain." At that time, I said that the democratic elements in the United States were very shallow, while Britain was almost there. But looking further, it still didn't quite seem right. Colonial rule was strengthening day by day, military preparations were expanding, and diplomatically, it had become a lackey of the United States, not like what a democratic country should be doing. — We have known the term "democracy" for over thirty years, and I have been pursuing an understanding of democracy for over six years, but what I have obtained is still something that is seemingly right but not quite. In these recent six days, I took a democracy class and gained more than in the past five years, or even thirty years.
    Let me be more frank, this was beyond my expectations. Since liberation, what I have admired about the Communist Party is their hard work, responsibility, humility, resourcefulness, and not being afraid of trouble. I love it because so many of my familiar and beloved young friends, under the leadership of the Communist Party, are all working desperately, and there is hope for China. The Communist Party's service to the people has been completely confirmed before my eyes, but I will honestly say that before attending the representatives' conference, I dared not fully believe that the Communist Party would realize democracy.
    I did not believe that the Communist Party would implement democracy for two reasons: first, the democracy I understood in the past was formal, not essential. It seemed that it had to involve voting, loud campaigning, and programs like the "His Majesty's Opposition" in the British Parliament to be considered democracy. After liberation, this set of formalities was absent. Second, the democracy I understood in the past was abstract, formally logical, not dialectical. If there is democracy, this society does not include dictatorship; the two cannot coexist. Therefore, when I saw the elements of dictatorship in the post-liberation regime, I could not believe that it would be democratic. These ideological burdens, thanks to this representatives' conference, have been removed from me.
    As soon as I stepped into the venue, I saw many people, wearing uniforms, work clothes, short shirts, cheongsams, Western suits, long robes, and even one wearing a melon cap — these obviously different figures, and they were discussing issues together in one venue. For me, this was a first in my life. What does this mean? I looked at the large characters "Representatives" hanging in front of the venue and couldn't help but nod. Representativeness! Beiping is inhabited by these many colorful figures. If everyone here at the meeting was the same, could it still be called a representatives' conference? These many people were not elected by universal suffrage of the citizens. Formally, it did not meet the democracy I understood in the past, but I ask, which parliament in Britain or America can achieve such a high degree of representativeness through universal elections? Do we want the form of elections, or the fact of high representativeness? Election is a means. If this means can improve representativeness, then it is desirable; if it cannot, then it is undesirable. Among the slogans hanging on the walls of the venue were the four characters "Seek Truth from Facts," and I also understood this. This was my first lesson.
    I sat down and listened to the reports. Mayor Ye and Director Tan talked about the situation of special agent activities in Beiping. My nerves suddenly tensed up, and I remembered the various conferences I had attended under reactionary rule in recent years. Sitting next to me was Mr. Qian Duansheng. On the night that the "December 1st" Movement in Kunming began, we were also sitting together. When it was my turn to speak on stage, gunfire suddenly erupted around the United University campus, and bullets whizzed over our heads. Compared to now, this scene is truly the difference between hell and heaven. Where is the difference? Today, I can sit in the venue with peace of mind to listen to speeches and speak, with only a warm atmosphere, and no gunfire to threaten me. Why? It is very clear: the armed forces of the reactionaries have been disarmed, and the activities of the reactionaries have been suppressed. This is dictatorship, no doubt about it. With this dictatorship, we have democracy in the venue. Without this dictatorship, our venue would become the lawn of the Southwest Associated University again. So I nodded again, understanding how democracy and dictatorship are combined. This was my second lesson.
    I took six days of classes. I am ashamed to say that I cannot really talk about my contribution to the conference itself, but I returned fully loaded. What I had not been able to figure out for many years, I gained enlightenment from this experience. How can I not sincerely thank this conference?
    Back home, I spent the whole day catching up on the newspapers from the past few days, and came across the White Paper published by the U.S. State Department. In this White Paper, they repeatedly claimed that China has entered a dictatorial political system. If I had not attended the Beiping All-Circles Representatives Conference, I might have believed their set of nonsense. It is a coincidence that when they were closing their eyes and talking nonsense on the other side of the Pacific, we on this side of the Pacific were in fact answering whether China has embarked on the road to democracy. I can be a witness: at the starting point of our first step, we have already exceeded the existing level of democracy in the United States. What's more, they are moving backwards every day?
    The Beiping All-Circles Representatives Conference is only the starting point of China's democracy. It has educated me. I hope that many friends with ideological burdens like me will have the opportunity to participate in such conferences and further recognize the essence of the new China in facts.

### 我参加了北平各界代表会议

　　我参加了北平各界代表会议
    费孝通
    北平各界代表会议一共开了六天会，对我说是上了六天课，这六天课里学到的抵过了过去六年，甚至三十多年。三十多年来我所追求的梦想的，在这六天里得到了。这是什么呢？是民主。我很早就听见过这民主两个字，五四运动的时候，我还是一个小学生。但是究竟怎样才算是一个民主的社会呢？我不明白。从小学到中学，从中学到大学，一路遇着各期的学生运动，我跟着跑，为什么呢？为民主。民主究竟怎样的呢？不明白。没有经验，怎能明白呢？长大了，碰着抗战。从国外回来，抗战已经进入第二年，反动的势力已经在后方高涨起来。我和许多朋友一样，看不惯这局面。怎么办呢？要求民主。民主究竟是怎样的呢？除了书本知识之外，还是不太明白。六年前，我到美国去做文化联络工作，我开始研究这问题。从反动政权底下到罗斯福时代的战时美国，的确感觉到气象不同。在这时我接触了资产阶级的民主，这种民主比我们当时的封建独裁是好得多。我在美国住了一年，回国以后写了一本书叫“初访美国”。我当时以为我明白了民主了，但是再看看又不太对劲了。民主和资本主义之间有不能调和的矛盾。于是我想我所追求的民主，大概并不完全如此的罢。过了一年多，我又有机会到英国去，那时工党初上台，自称是社会主义的国家，所以我当时希望在工党的英国可以给我看到民主的究竟了。战后的英国给我的印象的确很深，刚从官僚资本统治下的区域出来看到有条不紊的配给制度，印象怎能不深？住了三个月回来又写了一本书：“重访英伦”。我那时说，美国的民主成分很浅，英国则差不多了。但是往下看，又不对劲了。殖民地统治一天比一天加强，军备在扩张，外交上当了美国的伙计，不象一个民主国家应当做的样子。——我们知道民主这个名词已经三十多年，我追求要了解民主也已经有六年多，但是所得到的还是似是而非的东西。最近这六天，我上了一课民主课，所得到的多过于过去的五年，甚至三十多年。
    让我更坦白的说，这是出于我意外的。解放以来，我对于共产党钦佩的地方是苦干，负责，谦虚，有办法，不怕麻烦。我爱它，因为许许多多我熟悉的，我爱好的青年朋友，在共产党领导之下，个个都拼命的工作，中国有希望了。共产党为人民服务已在我眼睛面前完全证实了，但是共产党要实现民主，我很老实说，在参加代表会议之前，我是不敢太相信的。
    我不相信共产党会实行民主，有两个原因：第一是我过去所了解的民主是形式的，不是本质的，好象必须投票，必须大吹大擂的竞选，必须象英国的巴力门一般有着“陛下的反对党”之类的节目才算是民主。解放之后，并没有这套形式。第二是我过去所了解的民主是抽象的，形式逻辑的，不是辩证的。民主了，这个社会就不包括专政，两者不能同时存在。因之，我看见解放后的政权有专政的成分也就不能相信会民主了。这些思想上的包袱，感谢这次代表会议，它给我解除了。
    我踏进会场，就看见很多人，穿制服的，穿工装的，穿短衫的，穿旗袍的，穿西服的，穿长袍的，还有一位带瓜帽的——这许多一望而知不同的人物，而他们会在一个会场里一起讨论问题，在我说是生平第一次。这是什么意思呢？我望着会场前挂着大大的“代表”两字，不免点起头来。代表性呀！北平住着的就是这许多形形色色的人物。如果全是一个样子的人在这里开会，那还能说是代表会么？这许多人并不是由市民普选来的，形式上不够我以往所了解的民主，但是试问英美那一个议会能从普选中达到这样高度的代表性呢？我们要的是选举的形式，还是高度代表性的事实呢？选举是一个手段，如果这手段能提高代表性，那是要得的，如果不能，那就要不得。会场墙壁上挂着的口号里有“实事求是”四个字，我也领会了。这是我的第一课。
    我坐下来，听报告。叶市长和谭局长讲到了北平特务活动的情况。我的神经突然紧张起来，记起了几年来在反动统治下参加各种大会的情况。坐在我旁边的是钱端升先生，昆明“一二一”运动开始发动的那天晚上，我们也坐在一起。轮到我上台演讲时，联大校舍四围枪声突起，子弹在头顶掠过。这种景象和现在一比，真是地狱和天堂之别。这个差别在那里呢？今天我可以安心的在会场里听讲和发言，有的只是融融一堂的温情，没有枪声来威胁了。为什么呢？很明白的，反动派的武装被解除了，反动派的活动被镇压了。这是专政，一点也不错。有这些专政，才有我们在会场里的民主。没有这些专政，我们的会场又会变成西南联大的草坪了。我于是又点头了，领会了民主和专政是怎样结合起来的。这是我的第二课。
    我上了六天课。很惭愧的，我对于会议本身的贡献实在谈不上，但是却满载而返，多少年来没有搞通的，在这段经验中我得到了启示。我怎能不衷心的感激这会议？
    回到家里，把几天的报补看了一整天，碰着美国国务院发表了白皮书。在这白皮书里口口声声说中国已经进入独裁政治。如果我没有去参加北平各界代表会议，可能还会信他的一套胡言。真巧，太平洋的那端闭了眼睛混说的时候，太平洋的这一端却在事实上答复了中国是不是已走上了民主的道路。我可以做见证：在我们开步走的起点已经超过了美国现有的民主程度，何况，他们每天都在向后退呢？
    北平各界代表会议只是中国民主的起点。它教育了我。我愿意许多象我一样背有思想包袱的朋友，都能有机会参加这类会议，更进一步在事实中去认识新中国的本质。　　　（北平新华广播电台八月三十一日十九点五十分广播）
