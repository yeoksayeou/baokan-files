The German People Struggle for the Unification of Germany
    By Wilhelm Pieck, Chairman of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED)
    Four years have passed since the unconditional surrender of Fascist Germany. However, even today, the German people have not been promised a peace treaty. Achieving German unification and signing a just peace treaty are the basic demands of the powerful people's movement that is currently unfolding throughout Germany.
    As early as December 4, 1947, during the London Conference of Foreign Ministers, the First German People's Congress was convened in Berlin, with 2,200 delegates in attendance. The Congress elected a peace delegation to attend the London Conference and instructed the delegation to express to the four foreign ministers the German people's desire for unification and the prompt conclusion of a treaty. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov suggested accepting the German delegation, but his suggestion was rejected by the Western foreign ministers. The imperialist newspapers published in German in Germany could not hide their joy over this. At that time, all efforts to convene a conference of representatives from all German parties to determine the German people's views on organizing all-German government institutions according to the principles of the Potsdam Agreement were thwarted by the resolute opposition of West German politicians headed by Schumacher.
    Those people did not want any all-German meetings, because such meetings would contradict the aims of British and American monopoly capitalists. The purpose of American imperialism is to turn Germany into a colony and to transform the Rhine-Westphalia region into an arsenal for preparing new wars.
    The imperialist powers can only achieve their plans of dismembering Germany and strengthening the capitalist exploitation system in West Germany by relying on the support of German politicians and political groups.
    In June 1948, the Western powers published their so-called "London Recommendations." These proposed the organization of a "parliament" to formulate a West German constitution. In Western Europe, quite a few politicians and political groups obeyed this London directive. However, the more these gentlemen delved into the philosophy of the "constitution" at their Bonn conference, the more dissatisfied the German people became with these plans to divide Germany. The imperialist powers imposed Marshall Aid on the German people and promised to recognize West Germany as a state with equal status if it joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
    It has been almost a year since the Western powers carried out a separate currency reform in order to complete their plan to divide Germany. They believed that this reform would rapidly revive West German industry and commerce, and bring the entire economy back to "normal"—in other words, to a state of peace. This "peaceful state" has indeed brought unemployment, high prices, wage reductions, and the closure of enterprises. The number of unemployed in the British and American occupation zones exceeds 1,300,000, and there are more than a million workers working only short hours. The number of business closures is increasing monthly. Despite the people's need for consumer goods, unsalable goods are piling up in factories.
    In addition to these conditions, one must add the ongoing dismantling of West German enterprises. As is well known, factories were similarly dismantled in the Soviet occupation zone in 1945 and 1946, with the result that war industries disappeared in that region. Every loyal peace-loving person clearly understands that this dismantling was only used as part of the war reparations, and that the Soviet Union was fully entitled to such compensation.
    In West Germany, it is a completely different matter. Another motive lies behind the dismantling: it is not simply for war reparations, but for the benefit of American and British monopoly trusts. In the North Rhine-Westphalia region, the dismantling of synthetic fuel plants will soon begin. As is well known, Germany has few oil resources, so it must either import fuel from abroad or manufacture it artificially. On the other hand, the United States has the world's richest oil resources. Therefore, British and American oil companies insist that synthetic fuel plants must be dismantled in order to eliminate all competition from them in the region. When these factories close, ten thousand workers will be unemployed.
    Now, the wave of dismantling is also affecting other chemical plants in West Germany, bringing unemployment to tens of millions of factory workers and staff. Among the people in the Rhine-Westphalia industrial region, anger is growing over this cruel measure, and has reached such a widespread extent that even the Christian and Catholic churches have protested. Special "prayers" are convened in the churches, and when factories are dismantled, they ring slow bells.
    From the example of Pirmasens in the Palatinate, we can learn the tragic consequences of this dismantling and the trade policy that follows. Pirmasens is famous for its shoe industry. Although only one rack of machines was dismantled, less than one-fifth of the original productivity is currently being used. There are more than a million pairs of shoes unsold. The number of unemployed or semi-employed people is almost a quarter of the city's population. The reason for the disastrous situation in this shoe manufacturing center is simple: American shoes flood West Germany, and local shoe manufacturers are not allowed to trade with East Germany. This example is typical of most cities and most industries in West Germany.
    All of West Germany's foreign trade is controlled by American monopoly capitalists. Because they find it increasingly difficult in their own domestic market, American monopoly capitalists want to sell goods that have been sitting on their shelves for a long time to Europe and their West German colony.
    As the situation in West Germany becomes increasingly acute, people from all walks of life in Germany are beginning to ask: Where are we going from here? The German people are gradually understanding that Western imperialism is dividing Germany, making West Germany completely subordinate to American monopoly capitalists, and leading the vast masses of people into poverty. Moreover, American economic policies are affecting not only factory workers and staff, but also factory owners.
    The Western occupying countries have done everything they can to obstruct our movement for unity and a just peace treaty. In the American occupation zone and the American sector of Berlin, all propaganda in support of the People's Congress has been banned. The people of Berlin who hung red, black, and gold flags on March 18, 1949, to commemorate the German Revolution of 1848 were arrested and interrogated at police stations. Admittedly, the British occupation authorities did not openly prohibit propaganda for the People's Congress. But at the same time, they did not allow the election of delegates to the Third People's Congress to take place in the British occupation zone or the British sector of Berlin.
    However, despite these many obstacles and prohibitions, the election of delegates to the Congress received a powerful response in West Germany. In the Soviet occupation zone, 92.5 percent of the electorate participated in the election, of which 61.1 percent (i.e., 7,943,949 voters) voted "yes." When making this calculation, we should remember that West German parties, radio stations, and occupation authorities have issued vile and disgusting rumors to prevent people from voting. However, the voters in the Soviet occupation zone did not allow themselves to be confused by these rumors. The majority voted "yes." Even those who voted "no" were not against German unification and peace: they were merely influenced by false and inflammatory propaganda.
    The Third German People's Congress, convened on May 29, was attended by 1,400 delegates from the Soviet occupation zone and 616 delegates and guests from the Western occupation zones. All reports and speeches in the discussions raised the demands for achieving unification, signing a just peace treaty, and withdrawing the occupying forces. The Declaration to the German People, unanimously adopted by the Congress, had the same spirit. This unanimity was demonstrated by the delegation elected to attend the Paris Foreign Ministers' Conference.
    Speakers representing various regions of West Germany reported to the Congress on the industrial, agricultural, and cultural conditions in their regions, exposing the tragic consequences of the policies of the Western occupying powers and explaining the unfortunate situation that would be caused by obstructing German unification. Not only did representatives of the working class speak, but also factory owners, journalists, students, scientists—representatives from all walks of life. All of them recognized that if Germany is to have a peaceful life and develop a healthy economy, it must unify East and West Germany.
    The Third German People's Congress advocated the establishment of a broad all-German People's National Front to strive for German unity and peace. This National Front should have a broader foundation than the People's Congress movement. West German representatives particularly enthusiastically supported the establishment of this National Front. Moreover, it should be pointed out that there was no nationalistic sentiment in any of the speeches and proposals regarding this "Declaration." On the contrary, the "Declaration" repeatedly emphasized that this National Front for national unity, peace, and independence does not conflict with the peaceful aspirations of all friendly neighboring nations, and, on the contrary, it supports them.
    The Congress elected a peace delegation to attend the Paris Foreign Ministers' Conference with great enthusiasm. It included representatives from various German parties and groups. The secretary of the German People's Council elected by the Congress immediately requested the Foreign Ministers' Conference to accept the peace delegation in order to be able to present them with the demands in the "Declaration." This request was supported by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov. However, the Western Foreign Ministers once again rejected this proposal.
    All supporters of German unification sharply protested against this rejection by the American, British, and French Foreign Ministers. Throughout Germany, whether in factories or in various institutions, the demand was once again made that the Foreign Ministers' Conference must listen to the views of the Congress delegation. This demand demonstrates a desire that the peace-loving forces of the German people will act together regardless of the obstacles and regional boundaries between the various occupation zones, and regardless of party affiliation.
    The demand for unification and peace has aroused such a powerful response among the German people that even the enemies of unification and peace are using the same slogans to deceive the masses. Therefore, the imperialist newspapers and the German newspapers surrounding them are attempting to interpret the position of the Soviet delegation in Paris as if the Soviet Union were an enemy of German unification and a supporter of permanent control over Germany. They use this slanderous assertion to conceal the reactionary aims of the imperialist forces. However, the American Federation of Labor considered it necessary to lay the cards played by its masters on the table. Thus, in the program it submitted to the Paris Foreign Ministers' Conference, it demanded that the occupying authorities continue to remain stationed in Germany in order to protect the German people and Western Europe from the influence of communism (as the program stated). In reality, the issue lies in protecting the interests of American monopoly capitalists in Germany and Western Europe, who are striving to maintain the occupation of Germany and obstruct its unification.
    The German people's desire for lasting peace was enthusiastically expressed at the People's Congress and at the Third Congress of the Free German Youth League held from June 1 to 4. This desire was also expressed at the Youth Festival held in Leipzig, in the Soviet occupation zone, on June 5 and 6. The enthusiasm of millions of young people, their determination to do everything they can to establish a democratic system, and their deep desire to believe that friendship and solidarity must be practiced with the youth of all countries, all show that among young people, the call for unity and peace is receiving an increasingly powerful response.
    Corrupt Western European writers and politicians serving American monopoly capitalists are adding new obstacles in the path of the people striving for Germany's unification and peace. But their plan to divide Germany and sell Germany to American monopoly capitalists is doomed to failure because the masses of the people oppose them; because a disunited Germany without a peace treaty will always be a center of unrest in Europe and the world.
    The task of the peace-loving forces in Germany is to establish the broadest possible national front; it will include all people who love their motherland and are prepared to fight for unity and peace until a peaceful and democratic Germany is realized.

### 德国人民为争取德国的统一而斗争

　　德国人民为争取德国的统一而斗争
    德统一社会党主席  皮克
    法西斯德国无条件投降已经四年了。然而，直到今天，德国人民还没有被允诺签订和平条约。实现德国的统一和签订公正的和平条约，是目前正在全德普遍开展的强大人民运动底基本要求。
    早在一九四七年十二月四外长伦敦会议期间，第一次德国人民代表大会便在柏林召开了，与会的有两千二百个代表。代表大会选举了出席伦敦会议的和平代表团，指令该代表团向四国外长表达德国人民要求统一，要求迅速签订和约的愿望。苏联外长莫洛托夫建议接受德国代表团，但是他的建议遭到了西方各国外长的拒绝。在德国用德文出版的帝国主义报纸对此曾未能掩藏其喜悦。当时，召集德国各党代表会议，以确定德国人民关于按照波茨坦协定原则组织全德政府机构的意见的一切努力，都因以舒马赫为首的西德政客们底坚决反对而失败了。
    那些人们不希望有任何全德的会议，因为这种会议和英美垄断资本家的目的是相抵触的。美帝国主义的目的是要把德国变为殖民地，把莱茵——威斯特法利亚区变成准备新战争的武库。
    帝国主义列强只有依靠于德国政客们和政治团体的支持，才能达成其支解德国和加强对西德资本主义剥削体系的计划。
    一九四八年六月，西方各强国公布了他们的所谓“伦敦建议书”。其中提出要组织一个制定西德宪法的“国会”。在西欧，颇有一些政客和政治团体服从这一伦敦指令。但是，这些先生们越是在他们的波恩会议上穷究关于“宪法”的哲理，德国人民对于这些分裂德国的计划就越为不满。帝国主义强国把马歇尔援助强加在德国人民身上，并答应西德如果它参加北大西洋公约，将承认它为具有平等地位的国家。
    西方各强国为了完成他们分裂德国的计划而单独实行货币改革以来，已经将近一年了。他们相信，这次改革将会使西德工业和商业迅速复兴，并使整个经济“恢复常态”——换言之，即恢复和平状态。这种“和平状态”确实带来了失业、物价高涨、工资降低和各企业的倒闭。英美占领区的失业人数超过一、三○○、○○○以上，另外还有百万以上的工人只工作很短的时间。企业倒闭数目在逐月增加。尽管人民需要消费品，而卖不出去的货物却在工厂里堆集着。
    除了这些情况而外，还应当再加上仍在进行着的对西德企业的拆卸。如所周知，在一九四五和一九四六年，苏占区也同样拆卸过工厂，其结果是战争工业在该地区内消失了。每个忠实的爱好和平的人都清楚了解，这种拆卸只是作为一部分战争损失赔偿之用，而且苏联是完全应得这种赔偿的。
    在西德则是完全不同的一回事。拆卸背后隐藏着另外一种动机：并不单纯是为了赔偿战争损失，而是为了美英垄断托拉斯的利益，在北莱茵—威斯特法利亚地区，不久将要开始拆卸人造燃料工厂。众所周知，德国的石油资源很少，所以，它必须或者从外面输入燃料，或者由人工制造。而另一方面，美国则拥有世界上最丰富的石油资源。因之，英美石油公司坚持人造燃料工厂必须拆卸，以免除他们在该区内的一切竞争。而当这些工厂关闭时，将会有一万个工人失业。
    现在，拆卸的浪潮也正波及西德其他化学工厂，给成千万工厂工人和职员带来了失业。在莱茵——威斯特法利亚工业区的人民当中，对于这种残酷措施的愤怒正在日益增长。并且已达到了这样广泛的程度，甚至连基督教和天主教会都提出了抗议。各教堂里召集了特别的“祈祷”，当工厂被拆卸时，它们便鸣起徐徐的钟声。
    从普法尔次省波马森斯的例子，我们可以得知这种拆卸的悲惨后果和随之而来的贸易政策。波城以制鞋工业著名。虽然它只拆卸了一号架机器，然而目前只有不及原来五分之一的生产力在被使用着。没有卖掉的鞋子有一百万双之多。失业或半失业的人数几达全城人口四分之一。造成这个制鞋业中心灾难情况的原因很简单：美国鞋充斥西德，而本地的制鞋业主又不准与东德进行贸易，这个例子就是西德大多数城市和大多数工业的典型。
    西德的一切对外贸易都操在美国垄断资本家的控制之中。美国垄断资本家由于在本国市场上益感困难，所以，便想把他们长期摆在货架子上的商品拿来卖给欧洲和他们的西德殖民地。
    随着西德局势的日益尖锐化，德国各阶层人民乃开始发问道：我们从这里将走向何处去？西方帝国主义正在分裂德国，使西德完全隶属于美国垄断资本家，并将广大人民群众导向贫困，这一点，德国人民已开始逐渐了解了。而且，美国的经济政策不仅影响了工厂工人和职员，也影响了厂主。
    西方占领各国用尽了他们所能作的一切，来阻挠我们要求统一和签订正义的和约的运动。在美占区和柏林美占区，一切拥护人民代表大会的宣传都遭到了禁止。那些于一九四九年三月十八日悬挂起红、黑和金黄色的旗帜纪念一八四八年德国革命的柏林人民，被逮捕到警察所去并受到审讯。诚然，英国占领当局并没有公开禁止宣传人民代表大会。但同时他们却也不准在英占区或柏林英占区进行第三次人民代表大会的选举。
    可是，尽管有这许多障碍和禁令，代表大会的选举仍然在西德得到了有力的回响。在苏占区，百分之九二·五的选民参加了选举，其中百分之六一·一（亦即七、九四三、九四九个选民）投票“赞成”。在作这个结果的统计时，我们还应该记得，西德各政党、广播电台和占领当局曾发出丑恶的和令人作呕的谣言阻止人民的选举。但是，苏占区的选民们不允许他们自己被这些谣言所混乱。大多数人投了“赞成”票。就是那些“反对”票，也并不是反对德国的统一与和平的：它们不过是因为受了虚伪的煽动宣传的影响。
    五月二十九日召开的第三次德国人民代表会议，有苏占区的一四○○代表和西占区的六一六个代表及来宾参加。所有的报告和讨论中的发言，都提出实现统一、签定正义的和约及撤退占领军的要求。为大会一致通过的告德国人民宣言，也具有同样的精神。这种一致性，由被选举出席巴黎外长会议的代表团表现了出来。
    代表西德各地区的发言人向大会作了关于他们地区底工业、农业和文化情况的报告，揭露了西方占领国政策底悲惨结果，并说明对德国统一的阻挠将会引起的不幸局势。不只是工人阶级代表发了言，还有厂主、新闻记者、学生、科学家——各界的代表们。所有的人都承认，如果德国要得到和平的生活及发展其健全的经济，就必须统一东德和西德。
    第三次德国人民代表大会主张成立一个广泛的、争取德国统一与和平的全德人民民族阵线。这个民族阵线应当比人民代表会议运动的基础还要广泛。西德代表特别热情地拥护成立这种民族阵线。而且，还应当指出，在关于这个“宣言”的一切发言和提议中，没有任何民族主义的情绪。相反的，“宣言”再三强调指出，这个争取国家统一、和平与独立的民族阵线，并不与一切友邻民族的和平愿望相抵触，而且，恰恰相反，它正是支持他们的。
    代表会议以极大的热情选举了参加巴黎外长会议的和平代表团。它包括德国各个党派和团体的代表。由大会选举的德国人民会议的秘书立即向外长会议请求接受和平代表团，以便能够向他们提出“宣言”中的要求。这个请求得到了苏联外长莫洛托夫的支持。但是，西方诸外长又一次拒绝了这个建议。
    一切德国统一的拥护者，对于美、英、法外长的这种拒绝，尖锐地发出抗议。在全德国，无论是在工厂里和各个机关里，又一次地提出了要求：外长会议必须听取大会代表团的意见。这种要求表明一个愿望，即德国人民爱好和平的力量，将不顾各占领区间的障碍和地区的界线，不问党派地共同行动起来。
    争取统一与和平的要求，在德国人民中激起了如此有力的回响，以致于连统一与和平的敌人也在利用同样的口号欺骗群众了。因之，帝国主义的报纸及围绕在它周围的德国报纸，正妄图把巴黎苏联代表团的立场解释为好象苏联就是德国统一的敌人和永久管制德国的拥护者。他们利用这种诽谤的断言去掩盖帝国主义势力的反动目的。然而，美国劳联认为有必要将它底主人所玩的牌明摆在桌上。于是，它在向巴黎外长会议提出的纲领中，要求占领当局继续停驻在德国，以保护德国人民和西欧免受共产主义的影响（如纲领所说的）。实际上，问题是在于保护美国垄断资本家在德国和西欧的利益，他们正竭力要保持对德的占领和阻挠其统一。
    在人民代表大会上，在六月一日至四日召开的自由德国青年同盟的第三次代表大会上，都曾热烈地表现了德国人民要求持久和平的愿望。这种愿望于六月五、六两日在苏占区莱比锡举行的青年节中也同样表现了出来。千百万青年的热情，他们用尽一切努力去建立民主制度的决心，以及他们认为必须与世界各国青年友谊团结的深切愿望，这一切都表明，在青年人中间，要求统一与和平的呼声正得到日益有力的回响。
    为美国垄断资本家服务的堕落的西欧作家们和政客们，正在人民争取德国底统一与和平的道路上横加新的障碍。但是，他们这种分裂德国和把德国出卖给美国垄断资本家的计划，是注定要失败的，因为，人民大众在反对他们；因为，不统一的、没有签订和约的德国，在欧洲和全世界将永远是一个不安的中心。
    德国爱好和平力量的任务是建立一个最广泛的民族阵线；它将包括所有爱护祖国并准备为统一与和平而战斗到一个和平民主的德国得以实现为止的人们。
