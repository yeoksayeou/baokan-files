　　Pavlov and Psychology
    Sun Guohua
    September 26, 1949, is the centenary of the great Soviet physiologist Pavlov. I would like to take this opportunity to say a few words about his contributions. If our young students become interested in and explore Pavlov's research as a result, then our respect for Pavlov will be even more meaningful.

    Pavlov's lifelong research never deviated from the broad topic of "digestive gland secretion." His first great contribution was to overcome all difficulties and use new methods to extract gastric juice that was not mixed with saliva and food. From gastric juice secretion, he also noticed saliva, especially the psychological conditions of saliva secretion. This is what physiologists and psychologists often refer to as conditioned reflexes or conditioned responses. This is also his second great contribution. These two contributions are closely related, and we need not say much about them here. My intention in raising this point first is to illustrate that if a scholar can first grasp a problem, as long as he can devote himself to studying it, he will sooner or later achieve success. And before this topic is finished, he will see a second, a third, and many other kinds of topics. He wrote a book about conditioned reflexes. The reference materials he presented in this book are all special topics made by him and his students from 1903 to 1928, a total of more than 100 kinds. This is not accidental!

    Pavlov has been dead for nearly 13 years, and the research on conditioned reflexes by scholars from various countries continues to increase. Today, conditioned reflex is already a highly specialized subject, but the beginning of this research was very ordinary. Before Pavlov studied the saliva secretion of dogs, he had already seen two phenomena. One is saliva secretion caused by food, and the other is saliva secretion caused by other stimuli. The so-called other stimuli can be the sound of human speech, the smell of food, and other visual and tactile stimuli related to food. In fact, isn't the secretion of gastric juice also the same? Food elicits saliva secretion, which is an original or purely physiological reflex. A 200-cycle musical tone cannot initially elicit saliva secretion. However, if food and this musical tone are used to stimulate a dog simultaneously for several times, the musical tone alone can also elicit saliva secretion. Pavlov called this saliva secretion "psychic secretion" or conditioned reflex. Here we can see that the so-called "psychic" does not refer to saliva secretion, but that after similar training, the initially ineffective stimulus can replace food. I say similar training, because conditioned reflex is not only "simultaneous," but also "time-based" and "trace" conditioning. Otherwise, the ability of the dog's nervous system would be too low and pitiful. Some people think that the term psychic secretion obviously carries the meaning of joking with psychologists. This view is not without reason. Pavlov repeatedly said: If we do not abandon the vague position of psychology and engage in objective research, we will never understand the function of the higher animal's brain. I believe that most psychologists agree with Pavlov's statement, and I think the term psychic secretion is very beneficial to psychology. We can apply the words "psychic" to many other reactions, because most of the activities of humans and higher animals are acquired or learned. Psychic secretion or conditioned reflex belongs to this category. When Pavlov first published his saliva's conditioned reflex, some people joked with him, thinking that his research was well known to all dog trainers and there was no need to make a fuss about it. In plain language, so what? These people's jokes were wrong. Pavlov's contribution to conditioned reflex, just from the point of inspiring others' research, has a far greater impact than his other purely physiological research. The meaning of this passage is to point out that we should not think that all ordinary facts are not worth studying. There are many examples in the history of science that prove that many scholars started from ordinary places. Only those who are studious and thoughtful can see the meaning contained in ordinary things.

    The facts contained in conditioned reflexes, especially the relationship between one kind of conditioned reflex and other kinds of conditioned reflexes, such as the interaction between positive conditioning and negative conditioning studied by Pavlov, are extremely complex phenomena. Starting from a simple reflex and then studying the relationship between this reflex and other reflexes is extremely important, because any organism is a whole, and all parts are related. Here we can give a simplest example. Why is it that some conditioned reflexes are easily destroyed by accidental external stimulus changes? This is obviously a conflict between the nervous activities caused by two kinds of stimuli. Also, if the conflict reaches a certain degree, such as the many internal inhibitory effects cited by Pavlov, an experimental dog will show signs of neurological disorder. This is what he refers to as "experimentally produced neurosis." Studying neurosis in lower animals can give us a deeper understanding of human neurosis, and even get treatment methods, just as medical research mostly starts with animals. Although this research has just begun, Pavlov's contribution cannot be ignored. From simple to complex, any science, as long as it is on the right track, can exert its relationship to people. This seems to be something that we should all pay special attention to. Due to space limitations, we cannot talk more about conditioned facts.

    Conditioning is not only a specialized subject, but also a relatively convenient method. In the past 30 years, many scholars in the Soviet Union and other countries have slightly modified Pavlov's experimental methods and directly applied them to children's learning, especially newborn infants. Some people have found that infants can show conditioned responses within 10 days after birth. This is equivalent to saying that human learning begins very early, and we should pay attention to infant education just as we should pay attention to children's education. Others have found that children can even show conditioning phenomena in the womb. Unfortunately, their reports are very brief, and we cannot make specific estimates or determine whether their experiments are reliable. Previous philosophers and biologists thought that fetuses could learn, although this was only an imagination. Judging from the progress of modern developmental psychology, the realization of this imagination is probably not far away. In addition, Pavlov's conditioning method can be applied to other animals lower than dogs, such as sandworms, fish, etc., and we can prove that even lower animals have the ability to learn, which cannot be listed in this article.

    Studying conditioned reflexes requires a larger and well-equipped laboratory, otherwise the progress of the research will encounter many avoidable and unavoidable difficulties. From the inhibitory effect mentioned above, we can easily see this point. Pavlov was able to carry out his work in one of the best laboratories until he was over eighty years old. His success was certainly not his alone.

    The above seems to be entirely praise. Are Pavlov's experimental results and conclusions all perfect? Of course not entirely. Not all conditioned reflexes require the existence of the cerebral cortex, but Pavlov thought so. The biggest reason for this not very correct conclusion is because the animal he used was only a dog. This is also like his gastric juice experiment, although it is the most outstanding contribution in the history of physiology, it also has a shortcoming: he failed to prove that mechanical stimulation would cause gastric juice secretion. This is something that people who have studied digestive physiology have long known. Although the conditioning method is a simple and easy tool to obtain experimental results, it is not a panacea. Many psychological phenomena need to be studied by other objective methods. Conditioning is a kind of learning. Is all learning conditioning? Some people advocate this statement, but it is only a statement, and whether it is true or not remains to be worked on by all those who study psychology. In the past fifty years, many psychologists have indeed worked hard in this area.

    Pavlov was a great physiologist and also a great psychologist. He was able to grasp the meaning of simple phenomena, start from the aspects that can be done first, and promote his work step by step from simple to complex, opening up a scientific avenue for later generations. It is natural that such a scientist can be treated preferentially by the Soviet government, and this is also a major reason why he was able to continue working until he was eighty-seven years old.

　　巴夫洛夫与心理学
    孙国华
    一九四九年九月二十六日是伟大的苏联生理学家巴夫洛夫的百年生辰。我很愿趁此机会拉杂地说几句关于他的贡献的话。假使我国的青年学子因此而对于巴氏的研究发生兴趣与探讨，那么，我们对于巴氏所表现的敬意就更有意义了。
    巴氏一生的研究始终没有离开“消化腺分泌”这个大的题目，他的第一个伟大的贡献是在能克服一切困难，用新的方法提取不与唾液及食物混合的胃液。从胃液分泌他又注意到唾液，尤其是唾液分泌的心理条件。这便是生理学家与心理学家时常谈论的交替反射或交替反应。这也就是他的第二个伟大的贡献。这两种贡献有密切的关系，我们不必在此多说，而我首先提出这一点来的用意，是要说明一个学者如能先把握住一个问题，只要他能尽心尽力去研究它，他就早晚是会有成就的，并且在这个题目没有结束时，他会看到第二个，第三个，以及很多的其他种题目。关于交替反射，他曾写过一本书。在这本书里他所提出来的参考资料，都是他与他的学生们自一九○三至一九二八年所作的专题，一共有一百多种。这岂是偶然的！
    巴氏去世已近十三年了，而各国学者对于交替反射的研究仍然是有增无已。在今日，交替反射已经是一种极专门的学问，但是这种研究的开始却是平凡得很。在巴氏尚未研究狗的唾液分泌的时候，他早已看到了二种现象。一种是食物所引起的唾泌，另一种是其他刺激所起的唾泌。所谓其他刺激可以是人的说话声音，食物的气味，与食物有联系的其他视觉、触觉等等刺激。其实，胃液的分泌亦何尝不是如此。食物引出唾泌，这是一种原有的或是纯粹生理的反射。一个二百周的乐音在其初是不能引出唾泌的。不过，假使用食物同这个乐音同时刺激一个狗若干次之后，乐音单独地亦可引出唾泌。巴氏把这种唾泌叫作“心理的分泌”或交替反射。在这里我们可以看到所谓“心理的”并不是指唾泌，而是在类似的训练之后，最初没有效力的刺激能够替代食物了。我说类似的训练，因为交替反射不只有“同时的”一种，尚有“时间而发的”与“迹痕”的交替。不然，狗的神经系统的能力也就太低能得可怜了。有人以为心理分泌这个名词显然带着向心理学家开玩笑的意味。这样的看法并不是毫无原因，巴氏曾再三地说过：我们若不放弃心理学的模糊立场，从事于客观的研究，我们永远不会明了高级动物的大脑的机能。我相信大多数的心理学家同意巴氏的这种说法，并且我以为心理的分泌这个名词对于心理学是十分有益的，我们大可把“心理的”这三个字用到其他许多反应上面去，因为人类与较高级动物的活动大都是获得的或是学而后能的。心理的分泌或交替反射就是属于这一类。当巴氏初次发表他的唾液的反射交替，也曾有人同他开过玩笑，以为他的研究是所有训狗者所稔知，大可不必小题大作。用句普通话说，这算啥子。这些人的玩笑开错了。巴氏对于交替反射的贡献，只就启发他人的研究这一点讲，影响所及，远在他的其他纯粹生理学的研究之上。这段话的意思是要指出我们不要以为凡是平凡的事实便不值得研究，在科学史里有不少例子证明有不少的学者是从平凡处起家。能从平凡的事体里看到它们所包含的意义只有好学深思的人才能办到。
    交替反射里所包含的事实，尤其是一种交替反射与他种交替反射的关系，如巴氏研究的积极交替与消极交替之间的影响交互，便是极端复杂的现象。从一种简单的反射开始，再研究到这种反射与其他反射的关系，这是极端重要的，因为任何机体是整个的，各部分之间都有关系。在这里我们可以举一个最简单的例子。为什么有的交替反射很容易受外界的偶然刺激变化的破坏？这显然是两种刺激所引起神经活动发生了冲突。又如冲突到一种程度，如巴氏所举的许多内部制止作用，一个被实验的狗就表现神经错乱的现象。此即他所指出的“实验产生的神经病”。研究比较低级动物的神经病可以使我们对于人类的神经病有更深刻的认识，甚至于可以得到治疗的方法，此亦正如医药的研究大都先从动物着手一样。这种研究虽然是刚刚开始，巴氏之功是不可忽视的。由简入繁，任何一种科学只要上了轨道，就可以发挥它对于人的关系。这一点似乎是我们大家应当格外重视的。因为篇幅的关系我们不能再多谈交替的事实。
    交替作用不但是一种专门的学问，并且是一种比较方便的方法。近三十年来有许多苏联及他国的学者把巴氏的实验方法稍加修改，直接地运用到儿童的学习方面，尤其是新生下来的婴儿。有的人找到在生后十日之内，婴儿即可表现交替反应。这也就等于说，人类的学习在很早的时候就已开始，我们之应注重婴儿教育正如我们应当注重儿童的教育一样。又有的人找到小孩甚至于在胎内即能表现交替现象。可惜他们的报告都是十分简略，我们尚不能作具体的估计，断定他们的实验是否可靠。以前的哲学家与生物学家以为胎儿能学，这虽然只是一种想象。从现代的发展心理学的进步看来，这个想象的实现大约是为期不远了。此外，巴氏的交替方法之能运用于其他比狗更低的动物，如沙蚕、鱼等等，并且我们可以证明就是低级动物亦有学习的能力，这也是不能在本文内所能列举的。
    研究交替反射需要一个较大而又设备完善的实验室，否则研究的进行要碰到许多可以避免而又不能避免的困难。从上面已经谈到制止作用，我们可以很容易地看到这一点。巴氏能在一个最好的实验室里进行他的工作一直到八十余岁，他的成功当然不是他一个人的。
    以上所说的几点似乎完全属于颂仰。巴氏的实验结果与其结论是不是都是至美至善？当然不尽是的。所有的交替反射并不是都需要大脑皮质部的存在，而巴氏则以为是的。这种不很正确的结论底最大的原因是因为他所用的动物只是狗。此亦正如他的胃液实验，虽然是在生理学史里最出色当行的一个贡献，也有一个缺点：他未能证实机械的刺激会使胃液分泌。这是学过消化生理学的人早已知道的。交替方法虽然是一个既简便而又容易得到实验结果的工具，但它不是万应锭，有许多心理现象是需要别的客观方法去研究的，交替是一种学习，是不是所有的学习都是交替作用呢？有人主张这种说法，不过这只是一种说法而已，其为是与否，尚待所有研究心理学的人努力，而近五十年来亦确有许多心理学家在这一方面下工夫。
    巴夫洛夫是一位伟大的生理学家，也是一位伟大的心理学家，他能抓住简单现象的意义，先从能作的方面下手，由简至繁一步一步的推进他的工作，替后来的人开辟一条科学大道。这样一位科学家之能得到苏联政府的优待是当然的，而这也是他能继续工作到八十七岁的一个大原因。
