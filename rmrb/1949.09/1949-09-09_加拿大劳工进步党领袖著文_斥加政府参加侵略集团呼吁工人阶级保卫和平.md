Xinhua News Agency, Ottawa, September 5th: Tim Buck, leader of the Canadian Labor-Progressive Party, published an article on Canadian Labor Day, calling on all Canadian workers and trade union members to unite and fight to defend peace and oppose warmongers, and to strive for a policy of independence for Canada and freedom from the interference of American imperialists. Buck declared: The million-strong army of Canadian working people participating in trade unions, in the struggle to win the interests of millions of workers and their families, not only can, but will inevitably become a decisive force. He said: Canadian workers are facing a severe test. Big capital is rapidly leading Canada to a new economic crisis. While capitalists' profits and consumer goods prices have reached unprecedented heights in Canadian history, the purchasing power of the masses is declining and the exploitation of workers is intensifying. The Marshall Plan has hit Canadian exports. Unemployment in Canada is increasing daily. At the same time, the Canadian ruling clique is unscrupulously participating in preparations for a new aggressive war. After pointing out that agents of the reactionaries in Canada and the United States are trying to split the organized working-class movement in Canada, Buck called on Canadian trade unions to launch a resolute struggle for the unity of trade unions and against splitters of the working-class movement.

    斥加政府参加侵略集团呼吁工人阶级保卫和平
    【新华社北平七日电】塔斯社渥太华五日讯：加劳工进步党领袖蒂姆·布克于加拿大劳动节发表一文，呼吁加拿大所有的工人和职工会会员团结起来，为保卫和平及反对战争贩子而奋斗，为摆脱美国帝国主义者的干涉和争取加拿大独立的政策而奋斗。布克宣称：参加职工会的加拿大劳动人民的百万大军，在争取数百万工人及其家属的利益的斗争中，不但能够，而且必然成为一个决定性的力量。他说：加拿大的工人正面临严重的考验。大资本正迅速地把加拿大导向新的经济危机。当资本家的利润和消费品的价格已经达到加拿大史无前例的高度时，群众的购买力却在下降，对工人的剥削却在加紧。马歇尔计划打击了加拿大的出口。加拿大的失业正日益增加。与此同时，加拿大的统治集团毫不顾忌地参加了新侵略战争的准备。布克在指出加拿大及美国的反动派的代理人，正在设法分裂加拿大有组织的工人阶级的运动之后，呼吁加拿大的职工会为职工的团结，为反对工人阶级运动的分裂者而发动坚决的斗争。
