Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, 26th – According to TASS, New York: The United Nations General Assembly’s meeting on the afternoon of the 23rd was held in an atmosphere of extraordinary concern for the speech of Vyshinsky, head of the Soviet delegation. The UN General Assembly hall was packed on the 23rd. It was already known in advance that Vyshinsky was scheduled to speak that day. Hundreds of reporters representing dozens of countries crowded the press gallery. Movie cameras and television cameras were focused, and press photographers' flashbulbs were constantly flashing. Thousands of copies of the English translation of Vyshinsky's speech for reporters were snatched up in minutes. Journalists surrounded the Soviet representatives, wanting to obtain the English translation of the Soviet delegation chief's speech. Even before Vyshinsky's speech had ended, the largest news agencies had begun broadcasting Vyshinsky's speech to newspapers. When Vyshinsky appeared on the rostrum, the audience greeted him with prolonged applause. Vyshinsky's lively and substantive speech analyzing the policies of the Anglo-American opponents of international cooperation was listened to attentively by representatives of various countries and was often interrupted by applause.

In his speech, Vyshinsky first strongly denounced the Kuomintang representative Chiang Ting-fu for slandering the Soviet Union. Vyshinsky said: On the 22nd, there was such a representative—Chiang Ting-fu, the representative of the Kuomintang government, who attempted to use the platform of the General Assembly to make sordid distortions of facts and publish slanders against the Soviet Union. Chiang Ting-fu's playing with history naturally lacks even the most basic conscience and honest attitude in dealing with historical facts. Historical facts have been wantonly fabricated and distorted by him. For example, the Soviet Union, and only the Soviet Union, abolished all treaties infringing upon Chinese sovereignty from the Tsarist era twenty-five years ago and signed an agreement with China on the basic principles for resolving issues between the Soviet Union and China. However, Chiang Ting-fu concealed this matter. Moreover, he also concealed the fact that this agreement was the only equal treaty concluded with China by a major power on the basis of respecting China's equality and independence. Chiang Ting-fu's fabrication of facts and arbitrary distortion of the Soviet Union can only prove one thing, and that is, the beastly hatred of the Chinese reactionary group he represents for anything progressive and truly democratic, and the beastly hatred for the goals of the struggle currently being waged by the people of all countries under the leadership of their most outstanding representatives to defend their independence and freedom, to oppose imperialist oppression, and to oppose the deprivation of the people's rights. However, anyone with self-respect is not worth arguing with someone like Chiang Ting-fu.

Vyshinsky's speech then analyzed and narrated the facts of the "North Atlantic Alliance" and the "Marshall Plan" manufactured by the United States that undermined the United Nations organization, the new achievements of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries in economic and cultural construction, and the fact that the policy of the United States and Britain is aimed at preparing for another war and that the policy of the Soviet Union is to adhere to defending peace and international security.

The final part of Vyshinsky's speech was to propose, on behalf of the Soviet government, that the United Nations General Assembly adopt the following resolutions:

First, the United Nations General Assembly condemns the preparation for a new war, which is being carried out in certain countries, especially in the United States and Great Britain, which is manifested in the war propaganda encouraged by the governments of these countries, the arms race, and the swelling of military budgets that place heavy burdens on the people, the establishment of many land, sea, and air force bases on the territory of other countries, the organization of military blocs by certain countries that are following the goal of aggression against peace-loving democratic countries, and in other measures taken for aggressive purposes.

Second, since the use of poison gas and bacteria for war has long been condemned by civilized countries as the most serious crime against humanity, therefore, the United Nations General Assembly recognizes that the use of atomic weapons and other means of mass destruction of people is contrary to the conscience and honor of all nations and is incompatible with the qualifications of a member of the United Nations, and the Assembly believes that the adoption of unconditional prohibition of atomic weapons and the implementation of full and strict international control measures cannot be delayed any longer.

Third, the General Assembly urges all governments to resolve all disputes and contradictions by peaceful means, without the use of force or the threat of the use of force. In view of the firm will and determination of the people of all countries, expressed in the powerful people's movement in various countries to defend peace and oppose warmongers, to eliminate the threat of a new war and ensure the maintenance of peace, and bearing in mind that the primary responsibility for maintaining international peace lies with the five powers - the permanent members of the Security Council, the General Assembly unanimously expresses the hope that the five powers, the United States, Great Britain, China, France, and the Soviet Union, will work together for this purpose and jointly conclude a convention to strengthen peace.

　　苏联政府向联合国大会建议
  　谴责美英新战争准备
    无条件禁用原子武器·以和平方式解决争议维辛斯基痛斥蒋廷黻捏造事实诽谤苏联
    【新华社北平二十六日电】据塔斯社纽约讯：联合国大会二十三日下午的会议，是在对于苏联代表团团长维辛斯基的演说表示异常关心的气氛中举行的。联大会场在二十三日挤得水泄不通。事先，人们已经都知道，维辛斯基定于当天讲话。代表着几十个国家的数以百计的记者，挤满了记者席。电影摄影机和电视摄影机纷纷在对好镜头，摄影记者的镁光灯经常在闪耀。千百份供记者用的维辛斯基演讲词的英文译本，在几分钟内便被争夺一空。新闻记者们围住了苏联代表，想要得到苏联代表团长的演讲词英译本。甚至在维辛斯基演讲还没有结束之前，最大的几家通讯社已开始向各报播送维辛斯基的讲词。维辛斯基在演讲坛出现时，会场以历久不停的鼓掌相迎。维辛斯基分析国际合作的美英反对者的政策的生动而内容丰富的演讲，被各国代表密切注意地聆听并且常常被掌声所阻断。
    维辛斯基在演说中首先强烈地斥责了国民党代表蒋廷黻对苏联的诽谤。维辛斯基说：二十二日，曾经有这样一个代表——国民党政府的代表蒋廷黻，他企图利用大会的讲坛对苏联进行龌龊的歪曲事实并发表诽谤苏联的言论。蒋廷黻的玩弄历史，在处理历史事实上自然是连起码的天良和诚实态度都没有的。历史事实是被他肆意伪造和曲解了。譬如说苏联，而且只有苏联在二十五年前就废除了沙皇时代一切侵犯中国主权的条约，并与中国签订了关于解决苏中两国间问题的基本原则的协定。但是，蒋廷黻却把这件事情隐藏起来了。而且，他还掩盖了一桩事实，那就是，这个协定是大国在尊重中国的平等与独立的原则的基础上和中国订立的唯一的一个平等条约。蒋廷黻之伪造事实和任意地曲解苏联，只能证明一件事，那就是，以他为代表的中国反动集团对于任何一件进步的、真正民主的东西的兽性仇恨，对于各国人民目前在他们最优秀的代表的领导下为保卫自己的独立和自由、反对帝国主义压迫和反对人民被剥夺得毫无权利而进行的斗争的目标的兽性仇恨。不过，凡是一个有自尊心的人，都值不得去和蒋廷黻这样的人进行辩论。
    维辛斯基的演说，接着是分析和叙说美国制造的“北大西洋联盟”和“马歇尔计划”破坏联合国组织的事实，苏联与人民民主国家在经济与文化建设方面的新成就，以及美英的政策是旨在准备另一次战争与苏联的政策是坚持保卫和平与国际安全。
    维辛斯基演说的最后一部分，是代表苏联政府建议联合国大会通过下述决议：
    第一、联合国大会谴责新战争的准备，这种新战争的准备正在某些国家特别是在美国和英国进行着，这种准备表现在这些国家政府所鼓励的战争宣传、军备竞赛，以及使人民肩负着苛重负担的军事预算膨胀、在其他国家领土上建立许多陆海空军基地、正在遵循对于爱好和平的民主国家进行侵略这一目标的某些国家之组织军事集团以及在为了侵略目的而进行的其他措施上。
    第二、由于为战争而使用毒气及细菌，早已被文明国家谴责为对人类的最严重罪行，因之，联合国大会承认，使用原子武器以及其他大批毁灭人民的手段，是违背各国人民的天良及荣誉，是与联合国会员国的资格不能并容的，大会并认为采取无条件禁用原子武器并实施充分与严格的国际管制的措施，已不容再事拖延。
    第三、大会敦促一切政府以和平方式解决一切争议及矛盾，不得使用武力或施以使用武力的威胁。有鉴于在各国的保卫和平、反对战争贩子的强大人民运动中所表示的各国人民要求消除新战争威胁、保证维持和平的坚决意志和决心，并切记维持国际和平的主要责任在于五强——安理会常任理事国，大会一致表示期望美国、英国、中国、法国和苏联五强，为这个目的而共同努力并共同缔结加强和平的公约。
