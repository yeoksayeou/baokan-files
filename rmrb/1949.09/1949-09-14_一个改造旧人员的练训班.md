　　A Training Class for Remolding Old Personnel
    Our Correspondent Chen Ji
    After the establishment of the General Telecommunications Bureau of the Military Commission, in order to reform the bureaucratic organizations of the Kuomintang and simplify the original heavy organization, the Seventh Management Bureau of the former Ministry of Communications was abolished. However, in order not to miss any talent and to ensure fairness and rationality in personnel adjustments, the surplus personnel of the Seventh Management Bureau were combined with the personnel left over from the former Hebei Provincial Special Telecommunications Bureau, the former Hebei Provincial Security Command Communications Brigade, and the surplus personnel from the original telecommunications sub-bureaus of North China to form a temporary training class.
    There were more than 300 people in the training class, all of whom were staff members, including bureau chiefs, section chiefs, division chiefs, and a few lower-level staff members. Some of them had participated in reactionary parties, and some had been involved in corruption and bribery. Before receiving training, most of them held skeptical and fearful attitudes; some said in a wait-and-see tone: "I'll participate first and see if there is still a possibility of being transferred to another job." In the first two weeks of entering the training class, there were many complaints.
    Classes began on June 27. Liu Yin, Deputy Director of the General Telecommunications Bureau of the Military Commission, first gave a report on personnel organization issues, addressing their confused thoughts, and encouraged them to raise as many opinions as possible. More than ten days later, "specialists began lecturing, and group discussions" began. This stage lasted about forty to fifty days, with the main focus of learning being politics, with comrades from the General Bureau explaining the problems of the Chinese revolution and providing them with preliminary Marxist-Leninist education. After each lecture, the groups separated to discuss, raise questions, which were then collected and answered one by one by the comrades of the training class. At first, some disliked listening to lectures, feeling that "it's always the same old story?" But when discussing questions such as "How did the Kuomintang treat technical personnel?" "Why did American goods flood China during the Kuomintang era? Why couldn't Chinese goods be sold?", everyone gradually became interested: those who didn't take notes also wrote down a few sentences; those who didn't read revolutionary books also bought some pamphlets. Li Tingjie, a former unemployed soldier of the Kuomintang who had been transferred to work in the Telecommunications Bureau, looked down on revolutionary theory at the beginning of the study. He said, "What historical development or non-development, it's all empty talk." After participating in this discussion, he said, "Now I know that the failure of the Kuomintang was inevitable." He began to concentrate on reading "Public Enemy Chiang Kai-shek" and "A Modern History of China" and other books. In other groups, the number of people actively studying also gradually increased, actively speaking in discussion meetings, often asking the responsible comrades of the training class to answer questions, and even automatically refuting other people's incorrect opinions. They read newspapers very carefully, read Xinhua News Agency editorials; almost everyone had a copy of Chairman Mao's works, and "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship" became the center of reading and discussion.
    When the responsible comrades of the training class sent a group of people with strong abilities to work positions, those who originally thought that "training meant dismissal" felt that they had made a mistake in their understanding. One person who hated studying said: "I never expected the Communist Party to be so responsible and serious in doing things." Some people only then understood the original intention of the training class, and the enthusiasm for learning also increased as a result, and most of them made progress in their thinking. In group meetings, when discussing the Communist Party of China and the Chinese revolution, they all said: "If there were no Communist Party in China, it would have become a colony of foreign imperialism long ago." "If we want China to be prosperous and happy, we must follow the Communist Party." Some people began to express the transformation of their thinking with practical actions: for example, Zhang Zhenqian of the fourth group sent the telephone desk and other public property that his brother had not handed over to the public after liberation to the training class.
    In late August, classes ended, and personnel adjustment and deliberation work began immediately. First, the training class invited more than a dozen relatively upright elderly people to discuss personnel issues and solicit their opinions. The elderly were extremely moved after the meeting and said in group meetings: "At our age, we have never heard of such a thing - superiors adjusting personnel and asking for our opinions. The Communist Party does things in a truly upright manner. In the past, when people were transferred or laid off, we only heard rumors, and no one dared to ask, let alone let us discuss it." Then, the leadership absorbed some of the correct opinions of the groups and announced the policy for handling personnel to everyone. They were also allowed to discuss it on their own, and the cadres of the training class gave earnest explanations of the policy and put forward specific examples for education. For example, the amount of retirement pension was compared with the burden of farmers, and compared with the retirement pension of retired revolutionary honorary soldiers in the old liberated areas in the past. Everyone was very moved after hearing this. One elderly person, because his family circumstances were good, voluntarily gave up receiving a retirement pension. Wang Xiyong said with emotion when discussing the policy: "In the past, what I knew was: a new emperor brings a new court. If the superiors issued an order telling you to get lost, would you dare to say no? But now? People are organized and educated, our thinking is clarified, and we are considered again and again, not burying our skills and taking care of our lives. After the policy is announced, we are asked to discuss it again. I have nothing to say about the administrative approach to handling personnel, only three loud cheers: "Fair and reasonable." Zhang Dazhen, when discussing the policy in a group, recalled the scene when he was in the printing factory: "There were 4,000 people in our factory. The superiors said they wanted to lay off people. The Kuomintang bandits sent a large number of military police without asking why, and surrounded the factory tightly. Machine guns were pointed at us, and no one dared to say anything. We had to swallow our tears of sympathy for those who were wrongly laid off. Now, the Communist Party has come, and personnel matters are to be discussed by us, and opinions are to be expressed by us. This is truly unprecedented."
    Immediately following this discussion, the training class asked everyone to write materials, whether about themselves or others, put forward specific opinions, and openly exchange opinions in the groups. In response to this call, everyone enthusiastically submitted opinion papers and launched responsible reviews in the groups. Zhang Fengqi's opinion paper began by saying: "I was asked to write materials and say that someone is not good and should be laid off, but I have a very good relationship with him, and I really can't write it; but after more than a month of study, I feel that not writing would be unfair to the country and the people, so I finally wrote the following true materials..." Wang Guangyin said: "Administratively, countless efforts have been made for personnel handling. Now, if we don't tell the truth, we are really unworthy of our conscience." In this way, after more than a day, the materials were relatively complete. Based on these materials and existing knowledge, the training class drafted a list of those to be retained and those to be reduced. The leaders separately invited them to talk, soliciting the opinions of each person being laid off, and they all said: "Your handling is truly fair, and I am very happy." An elderly person said to the training class cadre: "My ability is indeed not enough, thank you for giving me so much pension. Everyone's assessment of me is very fair, and I leave, leaving happily." One person who had been very reactionary said to the person in charge of the training class: "You only dismissed me, and your handling of me is too lenient. After this period of study, I understand my mistakes. After I leave you, I must reform myself well and be a good person." Now, more than 200 retained people, some have been assigned to work positions. Those who were assigned to the Beijing Telecommunications Bureau and the Ministry of Railways have received good reviews there, and their work attitude is very good.

　　一个改造旧人员的练训班
    本报记者  陈迹
    军委电信总局成立后，为改造国民党官僚企业机构，简化原有的重型组织，曾将伪交通部第七区管局取消。但为了不遗漏人才，做到人事调整上的公平合理，特将七管局编余人员与伪河北省专用电信局、伪河北省保安司令部通信大队等单位留下的人员和华北原来各电信分局的余员合并成立了临时训练班。
    训练班共有三百多人，全部都是职员，有局长、科长、股长，也有少数下级职员。其中有些人曾参加过反动党派，有些曾贪污受贿。在受训之前，大多抱着怀疑和恐惧的心理；有的以观望的口吻说：“参加了再说，看看是不是还有调任工作的可能。”在初入训练班的两个星期，牢骚很多。
    六月二十七日开始上课，军委电信总局刘寅副局长首先针对他们的混乱想法，作了关于人事机构问题的报告，并发动他们尽量提意见。十多天后，开始了“专人上课，分组讨论”。这个阶段约有四五十天，学习内容以政治为主，由总局负责同志分别讲解中国革命问题，给以初步的马列主义教育。每讲一次，各组分开讨论，提出疑问，汇集起来，再由训练班同志逐一加以解答。起初有的讨厌听讲，觉得“讲来讲去，还不是那一套？”但在讨论“国民党是怎样对待技术人员的？”“国民党时代美国货为什么倾销中国？中国货为何卖不出去？”等问题时，大家渐渐发生兴趣了：不写笔记的，也写上几句了；不看革命书籍的，也买些小册子了。原国民党失业军人转入电信局工作的李庭杰在学习开始的时候，很瞧不起革命理论，他说：“什么历史发展不发展，全是空话。”参加了这段讨论后，他说：“现在我才知道国民党失败是必然的。”他开始聚精会神地读“人民公敌蒋介石”和“中国近代史”等书。其他一些小组，学习积极的人也逐渐增多，在讨论会里发言踊跃，常常找训练班负责同志解答疑问，有的并自动驳斥别人不正确的意见。他们很用心读报纸，读新华社社论；毛主席的著作几乎人手一册，“论人民民主专政”成了阅读讨论的中心。
    当训练班负责同志把一批确有较强能力的人送到工作岗位上去时，原来认为“训练即是遣散”的人都觉得自己认识错误了。有一个很讨厌学习的人说：“我决没想到共产党做事这样的负责认真。”有些人才明白了训练班的本意，学习的情绪也因而高涨起来，大多数在思想上有了进步。在小组会上，讨论到中国共产党与中国革命，他们都说：“中国没有共产党，早就成了外国帝国主义的殖民地。”“要想中国富强康乐，一定要跟着共产党。”有的人开始以实际行动表现思想的转变：如第四组张振谦把他哥哥在解放后没交给公家的电话桌机等公物送到训练班来。
    八月下旬，上课结束，旋即开始人事调理酝酿工作。首先训练班邀集了十几位比较正派的老年人，座谈人事问题，征求他们的意见。老年人在会后，感动得了不得，在小组会里说：“我们这个年纪，从没听到过这个事情——上级调整人事，还要征求我们的意见。共产党办事，真真正派。在以往，调人裁人，只听见风声，谁也不敢问问，那里能让我们讨论。”接着，领导上吸收了一部分小组的正确意见，把处理人事的方针向大家宣布。又让他们自动讨论，训练班干部并对方针作了恳切解释，提出具体例证来进行教育。例如把退休金的数目，曾和农民的负担作了比较，并与过去老解放区退伍革命荣誉军人的退休金做了对比。大家听了都很感动。有一个老年人因家庭境况还好，自愿不领退休金。王锡勇在讨论方针时，感慨地说：“过去我知道的是：一朝天子一朝臣。上面下了一个命令条子，要你滚蛋，你还敢说个不么？现在呢？把人编起来教育，把我们思想搞通了，又一而再，再而三的考虑，不埋没我们的技能，又照顾我们的生活。方针宣布了，又要我们讨论，我对于行政上处理人事的办法，没有说的了，只有大呼三声：“公平合理。”张大振在小组讨论方针时，想起了他当年在印刷厂的情景：“我们那厂共有四千人，上面说是要裁人，国民党匪军不问情由，派来大批军警，把工厂紧紧包围起来，机枪对着我们，谁也不敢说个什么，我们对于被冤枉裁掉的人，只好把同情的眼泪往肚子里流。如今，共产党来了，人事要我们讨论，主张由我们发表，这真是从古未有的事。”
    紧接着这段讨论之后，训练班要求大家写材料，无论对自己或别人，都提出具体的意见，并在小组里公开互相提意见，响应这个号召，大家踊跃的交上了意见书，在小组里展开了负责的评议。张凤起的意见书开头说：“要我写材料，说某人不行，应该裁掉，但他和我的感情很好，我实在写不下去；但我经过一个多月学习，我觉得不写对不起国家和人民，终于写了下面的真实材料……”王光荫说：“行政上为了人事处理，给我们费了无数的心血。现在，我们若不把实话说出，真真对不起良心。”这样，经过一天多，材料比较齐全了。训练班根据这些材料，并依据已有的了解，拟定了留用的和裁减的名单。领导方面分别邀请他们谈话，征询每个被裁的人的意见，他们都说：“你们的处理，真正公正，我感到很高兴。”有个年老的人向训练班干部说：“我的确能力不够，谢谢给我这么多养老金。大家对我的鉴定很公平，我走，走得高兴。”一个曾经很反动的人对训练班负责人说：“你们仅仅裁了我，对我处理的太宽大了。我经过这段学习之后，我懂得了自己的错误，我离开你们之后，一定要好好改造，做个好人。”现在二百多个留用的人，有些已分配到工作岗位上去。分到北平电信局和铁道部去的人，都在那里得到了好评，工作态度很不错。
