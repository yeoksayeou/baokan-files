Seeing the Growth of a People's City from a Conference
  ——A Record of the First People's Congress of Shijiazhuang City
    Yang Chongye
    The First People's Congress of Shijiazhuang City opened on July 20th and victoriously concluded on August 9th after twenty days. People's representatives, elected by the people of the whole city through universal suffrage, came together to discuss and formulate the administrative policies for building a people's city and, through democratic elections, formed the People's Municipal Government Committee, electing the mayor and deputy mayor. Such a congress was the first of its kind in Shijiazhuang and in cities across the country.
    The convocation of this congress had its foundations. Shijiazhuang was one of the first larger cities liberated in the North China Liberated Area. In the year and eight months after liberation, under the leadership of the People's Government, land reform was implemented in the suburbs, the industry and commerce in the city gradually recovered and developed, and the people's livelihood was guaranteed. The enemy harbored unparalleled resentment towards this people's city. Last year, in July and August, when the People's Liberation Army was victoriously advancing, American-made Chiang Kai-shek planes continuously carried out wanton bombings. However, this people's city still stood strong. The enemy also launched two surprise attacks, attempting to sabotage and destroy this people's city, but these conspiracies were smashed by the heroic People's Liberation Army in cooperation with the people of various places. Under the education of the Chinese Communist Party, the class consciousness of the city's workers was unprecedentedly raised. State-owned factories held continuous production campaigns for two months in November last year and May this year, producing many labor heroes and models. Taking this year's "Red May" production campaign as an example, production efficiency increased by an average of 48.1%. In the spring of this year, the Women's Congress, the Youth Congress, and the Workers' Congress were successively convened, all of which paved the way for the convocation of this People's Congress. After the liberation of Tianjin and Beijing, Shijiazhuang was affected by economic restructuring, and some industries and commerce once appeared depressed; recently, they have become active again, and a new type of people's city is gradually growing and developing.
    The 200,000 citizens of the city had high expectations for this congress. When electing representatives, some people even suspected, "How can ordinary people manage the government?" Their doubts were finally dispelled by the results of the election. The representatives of the congress included workers, farmers, engineers, teachers, doctors, industrialists and merchants, women, youth, and Hui people, totaling 160 people, representing all strata of people and ethnic minorities, and concentrating the will of 200,000 people. The congress received more than 480 proposals from people of all strata, and more than 100 additional proposals were received during the congress until its closing. Many proposals were written on small slips of paper, some were written on cigarette boxes, and some directly told the representatives, "We have a proposal, please take it to the congress." These proposals reflected the demands of the citizens' vital interests, such as adding street lights in certain places, installing tap water pipes in certain places, workers requesting the establishment of clubs, shop assistants requesting the establishment of vocational night schools, farmers requesting more fertilizer loans, and women requesting the organization of household women's production. In addition, there were many specific opinions. These proposals did not have any "reasons," but each one was valued by the congress, either listed for proposal discussion or answered by the government. During the congress, the dynamics of the venue and the speeches of the representatives were transmitted to the whole city through broadcasts. Crowds of listeners often gathered under the street loudspeakers, listening and discussing. The newspapers published detailed news about the congress. Some representatives also conveyed the message to the masses after each day's meeting or during the recess, while soliciting opinions from the masses. The people of Shijiazhuang City were all swept into this huge democratic wave.
    The congress first listened to two important reports: one was the work report of the Municipal Government for the past year and a half by Deputy Mayor Zang Boping, and the other was the report on the current situation and administrative policies by Mayor Liu Xiufeng. The work report of the Municipal Government was approved after being reviewed by the congress, and the representatives put forward criticisms and some supplements. This first step fully demonstrated the democratic spirit of the congress. Many representatives felt strange about the government's financial disclosure, and some said, "In the past, they (referring to the Kuomintang government) only asked us for money, and we only gave it out. They put the money in their pockets, and who dared to ask a question?" Some representatives used an analogy and said, "The People's Government is like a treasurer that everyone has found, reporting the accounts to the owners when the time comes."
    In his report, Mayor Liu Xiufeng put forward the Party's policy of taking all aspects into consideration, and based on this policy, he put forward specific administrative policies for building Shijiazhuang. This report was generally welcomed by the representatives of the congress. Some representatives of private industrial and commercial enterprises used their own experience to illustrate the help of the public to private industrial and commercial enterprises, such as loans, raw material loans, coke loans, and even flour for workers to eat; each of them could say a string of numbers. They also criticized some private industries for being disloyal to the public. The manager of a private iron factory said: "The trading company helped our iron industry to purchase finished products, but some who did not understand the overall situation sent all the old rusty iron pots they had in stock, causing the public to lose money. This is not in line with public-private cooperation." Mutual benefit for labor and capital was also a matter of great concern to everyone. After listening to Mayor Liu's report, some representatives reflected: "This has solved many of our problems. In the past, we didn't have a deep understanding of the policy, and we were timid and didn't dare to develop. In the future, we will do as Mayor Liu said, benefit both labor and capital, and develop production." A representative of the shop assistants' union said: "In the past, we didn't know what was truly mutually beneficial for labor and capital. When managers and bosses restricted workers and shop assistants from joining the union and even fired workers, we knew to organize workers and shop assistants to reason and fight for them. We didn't do enough to raise the awareness of workers and shop assistants, educate them to abide by labor discipline, and persuade managers and bosses to broaden their horizons and focus on production." On the issue of urban-rural relations, business representatives had many opinions. They criticized that some people's attitude towards business was not good in the past, especially towards the people in the countryside. As soon as they quoted a price, it was "half-price with a twist." If people asked the price and didn't buy it, they felt they had a reason to treat them with harsh words. In the future, they must achieve "genuine goods at fair prices, no deception for the old or the young." Farmers' representatives understood this issue more specifically, and some said: "We will grow more grain and cotton, and take the cotton and excess grain to the city to exchange for farm tools. This is urban-rural cooperation." Everyone enthusiastically supported and passed this report.
    The second stage of the congress was the discussion of proposals. This stage took the longest time and the discussion was the most enthusiastic, because each proposal involved specific issues. Regarding some proposals on developing industry and commerce, the representatives discussed them with full confidence. Although Shijiazhuang currently has only 200,000 people, its location is a transportation hub with access to all directions, and the nearby areas are producers of industrial raw materials - coal, iron, and cotton. These favorable conditions make it a important industrial city in the future. According to the current situation, the congress passed that iron, textile, bullet rolling, oil extraction, flour, fertilizer production and other processing industries should be the focus, and gradually develop. Under the principle of public-private cooperation, some private factories can adopt the method of state orders, vigorously implement technological improvements, add new machines, and call on small factories to operate jointly on a voluntary basis to improve product quality. Regarding the issue of private silver houses, the congress had a debate. The original proposal proposed the establishment of a silver house specializing in industrial and commercial deposits and loans, with funds subsidized by the government. Many representatives opposed this proposal, believing that some private silver houses loaned money to merchants engaged in speculation and profiteering, or used deposits to hoard materials, which was not good for the development of legitimate industry and commerce; on the contrary, some people thought that private silver houses could solve the turnover of industrial and commercial funds. In order to concentrate efforts and invigorate finance, everyone deposited unused funds in the silver houses and lent them to merchants who needed funds, which was beneficial to the development of industry and commerce. The congress finally decided that private silver houses must be managed in accordance with the regulations on the management of silver and money industries stipulated by the North China Government, and the amount of funds and the deadline for fund-raising for newly established silver houses can be relaxed. Both sides of this dispute were satisfied.
    During the discussion of labor-capital issues, the congress proceeded most enthusiastically. On one day, 32 representatives spoke, with more than 60 speeches. This debate was triggered by the "Provisional Measures for Wages, Working Hours, Welfare, etc. of Employees in Private Factories and Shops" requested by the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions for review. One or two representatives believed that for more than a year since liberation, the government had only taken care of the labor side in implementing the policy of mutual benefit for labor and capital, and believed that the capital side had many difficulties in implementing mutual benefit for labor and capital, and felt that workers' welfare was not easy to handle. Many representatives raised objections, and many worker representatives spoke. A worker representative specifically explained that the trade union and workers have been implementing the government's policy of mutual benefit for labor and capital. For example, at the city-wide worker representative conference held in March this year, some workers in private factories requested that the provisional measures for labor protection and welfare of state-owned factories should also be implemented in private factories, which was not possible under the current conditions. After persuasion and education by the worker representative conference, this method suitable for both labor and capital was finally formulated. He said: "Workers understand that developing production and mutual benefit for labor and capital is the long-term interest of workers." Another worker representative gave an example to show that workers took care of the capitalists: "The business of the Dazhong Iron Factory in this city was not good, and the workers automatically cancelled welfare such as haircuts and bathing. In order to tide over the lean months, the workers took the initiative to go home and rest, without wages, to reduce the burden on the counter." Another worker representative said: "A manager can support his whole family, but the workers only ask to support two people, one is himself, and the other is his wife, not eating white flour and rice, but eating millet and cornmeal." Other representatives believed that the education of both labor and capital should be strengthened to unite and produce. An industrial and commercial representative said: "When the meat is fat, the soup is also fragrant. As long as production is developed and money is earned, the problem will be solved." Another point of contention in the labor-capital issue was the issue of severance pay and medical expenses. Some industrial and commercial representatives disagreed with the provision of severance pay, arguing that some factories and shops could not afford severance pay when they were losing money and reducing their business or closing down. At the same time, they believed that it was not easy to specify medical expenses. Other representatives believed that if business was in deficit, severance pay should be given according to the actual situation when production was reduced or business was closed down. The capital side should be responsible for taking care of the living expenses and medical expenses of short-term patients. A worker representative said: "As long as the capital side treats the workers kindly, the workers will never be ambiguous in production. If the capital side always carries an abacus with them when dealing with the workers, the workers will also hold a scale everywhere in production, so that the relationship between labor and capital will not be good." When the debate finally came to an end, Mayor Liu Xiufeng stood up as a representative and spoke. He explained that the government, in order to implement the policy of protecting and developing industry and commerce, basically took care of both sides, but there was a short period of time when the government took less care and approached the capital side less in order to mobilize the workers. Before liberation, workers had no status and lived in poverty. After liberation, in order to ensure that workers' lives had certain guarantees, organizations were established, education was strengthened, and their awareness was raised, which was also beneficial to the development of production. He emphasized that labor and capital should unite and produce, and the capital side should take the initiative to provide various care to the labor side to stimulate the enthusiasm of employees in production. Private factories should learn from state-owned factories in this regard; workers should work hard to produce, and combine current interests with long-term interests, so as to achieve mutual benefit for labor and capital. Finally, the congress revised and passed the proposal submitted by the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions. The representatives of the congress all believed that they had received a lot of education from this debate.
    The proposals successively passed by the congress also included 13 major categories such as municipal construction, culture and education, agricultural production, women, Hui people, and public security and justice. These proposals were carefully discussed and passed by the congress and in group meetings. As many representatives have reflected, this congress has laid the track for building an industrialized Shijiazhuang.
    The climax of the congress was the campaign and election of members of the Municipal Government. According to the organizational regulations of the Municipal People's Government passed by the congress, the Municipal Government Committee is composed of 25 people elected by the People's Congress. It is a democratic centralized organization. All major measures of the Municipal Government must be decided and implemented by the committee. The members of the Municipal Government also mutually elect one mayor and one deputy mayor, and report the election to the higher-level government for appointment. During the campaign, the congress fully exerted the spirit of democracy and unity. People from all walks of life campaigned for each other. Yan Jinfen, a model female worker of the Daxing Textile Factory, and Ji Gengsheng, a labor hero of the Railway General Factory, and several excellent worker representatives were all supported by everyone. People campaigning for old hero Ji said: He is the old Hou in the movie "The Bridge", treating the factory as his own home. Farmers' leaders Lu Chunchang and Zhao Gannian were both poor peasants who had been turned over, and they played an active role in land reform and leading farmers in large-scale production. Many people campaigned for them. Several local cadres, old workers of the "February 7th" strike, Song Gongyu, Chen Meisheng, and Li Bin, their lives are a string of revolutionary struggles. They were imprisoned and tortured. They persisted in underground work before the liberation of Shijiazhuang. During the campaign, they received warm applause. Party Secretary and Mayor Liu Xiufeng was even more warmly supported by the masses. More than a dozen representatives from all walks of life campaigned for him, and some people linked his name with the policy of taking all aspects into consideration. Workers campaigned for engineers, engineers campaigned for workers, cadres campaigned for the masses, and the masses campaigned for cadres. This campaign process lasted a whole day, and voting did not begin until evening. As a result, the elected government committee members included workers, farmers, engineers, industrialists and merchants, intellectuals, doctors of Chinese and Western medicine, women, and Hui people. Only six Party and government cadres from the old liberated areas, and the rest were mass leaders who were born and raised locally and selected by the masses. The Party cadres were also equivalent to being appraised by the masses and gained the support and trust of the people. The new regime is precisely the embodiment of the "people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance" on the local regime as instructed by Chairman Mao, setting a precedent for all parts of the country.
    Mayor Liu Xiufeng and Deputy Mayor Zang Boping were unanimously supported by the members of the Municipal Government as mayor and deputy mayor for their political achievements in the past year or so. As one representative said: "Mayor Liu is still Mayor Liu, but he is now elected by our 200,000 people." After this election, the people of the whole city showed unparalleled enthusiasm. Some mass organizations went to the venue to present flowers, dances, and songs, and recited dedications supporting their own people's government. When Ji Gengsheng, a model old hero of the Railway General Factory, was elected, the workers immediately formed a Yangko team to congratulate old hero Ji's family. When the model female worker of the Daxing Textile Factory was elected, the female workers were overjoyed. They believed that the lives of female workers would be more secure in the future. When Dai Xizhi, an engineer of the coking plant, was elected, the workers of the plant spread the news with joy on their faces. They expressed that they would actively produce and protect the factory to celebrate the successful conclusion of the conference. Five industrialists and merchants were elected as members of the government, and they became figures of street talk. The shop assistant of a tea shop said: "Our manager has been elected. Our shop's policy of mutual benefit for labor and capital has been implemented well. I hope he can persuade the managers of all the shops in the district to implement the resolution of the conference well." Ping Lian, a Hui representative, was elected from the Liu Family Courtyard, which was called the beggar's courtyard. Old man Ping had herded sheep all his life. It was only after liberation that he put down his whip and became "red in his old age." Lu Chunchang, a farmer who had been turned over, was also elected. As he himself said, "In the past, let alone the affairs of the Municipal Government, even the affairs of the village were not our business." The representatives and citizens jointly uttered a heartfelt and joyful sentence: "Only the Communist Party has true democracy."
    The congress is over. In factories, in neighborhoods, and in the rural areas of the suburbs, representatives are organizing various forms of gatherings to convey the spirit and resolutions of the congress. The representatives expressed that they want to serve as a bridge between the government and the masses, bringing the resolutions of the congress to the masses and concentrating the opinions of the masses to the government. The various departments of the government have drafted specific implementation plans for the resolutions of the congress. Some work has already been started, and some has been completed. The prospect of a new industrialized city has already unfolded before the eyes of the 200,000 people of Shijiazhuang.

　　从一个会议看一个人民城市的成长
  　——记石家庄市第一次人民代表大会
    杨重野
    石家庄市第一次人民代表大会在七月二十日开幕，开了二十天，到八月九日胜利闭幕。由全市人民普选产生的人民代表来讨论、制订建设人民城市的施政方针并经过民主选举组成人民市政府委员会，选出正、副市长，这样的大会在石家庄和在全国各城市都还是第一次。
    这个大会的召开是有它的基础的。石家庄是华北解放区解放最早的较大的城市，解放后一年零八个月，在人民政府的领导下，郊区实行了土地改革，市内的工商业已逐渐恢复和发展，人民的生活得到了保障。敌人对这个人民的城市怀着无比的嫉恨，去年七八月正当解放军胜利进军的时候，美制蒋机连续肆行大轰炸，但这个人民的城市依然坚强崛立着，敌人也曾进行两次偷袭，企图破坏和毁灭这座人民的城市，这些阴谋都被英勇的人民解放军配合各地人民给粉碎了。全市职工在中国共产党的教育下，阶级觉悟空前提高，公营工厂在去年十一月和今年红五月曾举行了连续两个月的生产大竞赛，涌现了许多劳动英雄和模范，以今年“红五月”的生产竞赛来说，生产效率平均提高百分之四八·一。本年春，妇女代表大会，青年代表大会，职工代表大会先后召开，这些都为这次人民代表大会的召开铺平了道路。平津解放后，石家庄受经济改组影响，一部分工商业曾一度显得萧条；最近又重趋活跃，一个新型的人民城市正逐渐长成和发展着。
    全市二十万市民对这次大会怀着热切的期望，选举代表的时候还有人怀疑“老百姓那能管政府？”他们的疑团终被选举的结果打破了。大会的代表有工人、农人、工程师、教员、医生、工商业家、妇女、青年和回民共一百六十个人，代表了各阶层人民和少数民族，集中了二十万人民的意志。大会收到各阶层人民的提案四百八十多件，在大会进行期间到闭幕前又陆续收到了一百多件。提案很多是写在一个小纸条条上，也有的写在香烟盒上，有的直接对代表说：“咱提个议，给咱带到大会上去。”这些提案反映市民切身利益的要求，象在某处要添设路灯，某处要按装自来水管子，工人要求设立俱乐部，店员要求办职业夜校，农民要求多贷肥，妇女要求组织家庭妇女生产。此外，还有很多具体的意见。这些提案都没有什么“案由”，但每一条都受到大会的重视，或是列入提案讨论，或是由政府给予解答。大会进行期间，会场动态和代表发言都通过广播传达全市，在街头放送器下面时常拥着一群群的听众，他们一边听着，一边谈论着。报纸上详细登载着大会新闻。有些代表们还在每天的会后或是休会期间向群众传达，同时征询群众意见，石家庄市的人民都卷入了这个巨大的民主浪潮里。
    大会首先听取了两个重要报告：一个是臧伯平副市长的一年半以来市政府的工作报告，一个是刘秀峰市长的目前形势和施政方针的报告。市政府的工作报告经过大会审查后批准了，代表们并提出批评和一些补充，这第一步就充分的表现了大会的民主精神。很多代表对政府的财政公开觉得希奇，有的说：“过去人家（指国民党政府）只向咱们要，咱们光是出，人家把钱装腰包里了，谁敢问一句？”有的代表打个譬喻说：“人民政府就象大家找到的掌柜的，到日子向东家报报帐。”
    刘秀峰市长在报告里提出了党的四面八方的政策，并根据这个政策提出建设石家庄具体的施政方针。这个报告受到大会代表们普遍地欢迎，一些私营工商业的代表，都以切身经验说明公家对私营工商业的帮助，象贷款、贷原料、贷焦炭，以至贷给工人吃的面粉；他们每个人都可以说出一串数目字。他们也批评一些私营行业对公家不忠实。一家私营铁工厂的经理说：“贸易公司帮我们铁工业收购成品，有些不明大义的却把旧存的生了锈的铁锅也统统送去，叫公家赔了钱。这是不合公私兼顾的。”劳资两利也是大家最关心的问题，听了刘市长的报告，有的代表反映说：“这可给咱们解了很多疙瘩，过去咱们对政策了解不太深刻，缩手缩脚的不敢发展，今后咱们要照刘市长说的做，劳资两利，发展生产。”一个店员工会的代表说：“以往，什么真正是劳资两利，咱们也闹不清楚，当经理、老板们限制工人、店员参加工会，还解雇工人的时候，咱们懂得组织工人、店员说理，替工人、店员争，说到提高工人、店员的觉悟，教育他们遵守劳动纪律，说服经理、老板放大眼光，安心生产，就做得不够。”在城乡关系上商界代表有很多意见，他们批评过去一些做生意的态度不好，尤其对待乡下人，一要价就是“对半带拐弯”，人家问个价不买，就算抓住了理，恶言恶语相待，今后要做到“货真价实，童叟无欺”。农民代表对这个问题理解得更具体，有的说：“咱们多打粮食，多种棉花，把棉花和吃不了的粮食拿到城里换农具，这就是城乡互助。”大家非常热烈拥护的通过了这个报告。
    大会进行的第二阶段是提案讨论，这个阶段的时间最长，讨论也最热烈，因为每条提案都牵涉到具体的问题。关于发展工商业的一些提案，代表们讨论时充满着信心。石家庄现在虽然还只二十万人口，但由于所在地位是四通八达的交通中心，而附近地区是一些工业原料——煤、铁、棉花的出产地，这些有利的条件就使它将来成为一个重要的工业城市。根据目前情形，大会通过应以铁工、纺织、弹轧、榨油、面粉、制肥及其他加工业为重点，逐步发展。在公私兼顾的原则下，有些私营工厂可以采取国家订货的办法，大力施行技术改进，增添新式机器，并号召小型工厂在自愿原则下联合经营，提高产品质量。关于私营银号问题，大会曾有争辩，原提案提出设立一种专办工商业存放款的银号，资金由政府补助。很多代表反对这个提案，认为一些私营银号贷款给从事投机倒把的商人，或是利用存款囤积物资，对正当工商业的发展没有好处；相反的意见认为私营银号可以解决和商资金的周转，为了集中力量，活跃金融，大家把不用的款存到银号贷给需要资金的商户，这对发展工商业有好处。大会最后决议，私营银号必须按照华北政府规定的银钱业管理办法加以管理，对新设立的银号的资金数额和集款期限可以放宽。这样争议的双方均表满意。
    在讨论劳资问题的时候，大会进行的最热烈，一日间代表发言的有三十二人，发言达六十余次。这场争论是由市总工会请求审核的关于“私营工厂、商店职工的工资、工时、福利等暂行办法”引起的。有一两位代表认为解放一年多，政府在执行劳资两利的方针上，只照顾劳方，并且认为在执行劳资两利上，资方有许多困难，觉得工人福利等不好办。很多代表提出反对的意见，工人代表发言的很多。一个工人代表具体地说明工会和工人一直在执行政府的劳资两利的方针，譬如，在今年三月举行的全市工人代表大会上，有的私营工厂工人要求在私营工厂也要执行公营工厂的劳保、福利等暂行办法，这在目前条件是办不到的，经过工代大会的说服教育，最后才制订出这个适合于劳资双方的办法。他说：“工人懂得发展生产劳资两利才是工人的长远利益。”另一个工人代表举例子说明工人照顾了资本家：“本市大众铁工厂营业不好，工人自动取消了理发、洗澡等福利，为了渡过背月，工人开个会自动回家歇伏，不要工资，来减轻柜上的负担。”另一个工人代表说：“一个经理可以供养他全家的生活，可是工人只要求养活两口人，一个是他自己，一个是他的老婆，不是吃白面大米，而是吃小米棒子面。”另外一些代表们认为应该加强劳资双方的教育，团结生产。一个工商业代表说：“肉肥汤也香，只要发展生产，赚了钱，问题就好解决。”劳资问题的另一争点是关于解雇金和医药费问题。有的工商业代表不同意有解雇金的规定，理由是有些工厂、商店因亏本缩小营业或歇业时拿不出解雇金，同时认为医药费也不好具体规定。别的代表认为生意亏累了，缩小生产或歇业应该根据实际情况发给解雇金。短期病号的生活费和医药费应由资方负责照顾。一个工人代表说：“只要资方好心的对待工人，工人在生产上决不含糊，要是资方对工人时时带着算盘，工人在生产上也会处处攒着一杆秤，那样劳资关系就不会搞好。”最后争论告一段落时，刘秀峰市长以代表身份起立发言，他说明政府为执行保护与发展工商业的政策，基本上是照顾双方的，但有一个短时期为着发动工人，政府照顾与接近资方少，也是有的。解放前工人没有地位，生活困苦，解放后为了使工人生活有一定的保障，成立组织，加强教育，提高他们的觉悟，这对发展生产也是有好处的。他强调说，劳资要团结生产，资方应主动的对劳方予以各种照顾，来启发职工生产的积极性，私营工厂在这方面应该向公营工厂学习；工人要努力生产，把目前利益和长远利益结合起来，这样就达到劳资两利。最后大会修正通过了市总工会提交的议案，大会代表们都认为从这次争论里受到了很多教育。
    大会先后通过的提案还有市政建设、文化教育、农业生产、妇女、回民和公安司法等十三大类，这些提案都经过大会和小组会上仔细讨论通过的。正象很多代表们所反映的，这次大会已为建设工业化的石家庄安下了轨道。
    大会的最高潮是竞选和选举市政府委员。根据大会通过的市人民政府的组织条例，市政府委员会由人民代表大会选举二十五人组成，它是民主集中制的组织，凡市政府的重大措施须由该委员会决议实行，市政府委员并互选正、副市长各一人，选出后报请上级政府任命。在竞选的时候，大会充分发挥了民主团结的精神。各阶层人民相互竞选。大兴纱厂模范女工阎金芬和铁路大厂劳动英雄计根生和几个优秀的工人代表都受到大家的推戴，为计老英雄竞选的人说：他就是电影“桥”里的老侯，把工厂当成自己的家。农民领袖陆春长、赵甘年都是翻了身的贫农，在土改和领导农民进行大生产中都起着积极的作用，好多人为他们竞选。几个本地干部“二七”老工人宋公玉、陈梅生、李斌，他们的生活就是一串革命斗争的历史，坐监、受拷打，石家庄解放前坚持地下工作，在竞选时，他们受到热烈的鼓掌。党委书记刘秀峰市长更受到群众热烈的拥护，各阶层人民代表为他竞选的有十几个人，有的把他的名字和四面八方政策联到一起。工人们为工程师竞选，工程师也为工人们竞选，干部为群众竞选，群众也为干部竞选。这个竞选的过程经过了一整天，到傍晚才开始投票。结果选出的政府委员，有工人、有农民、有工程师、有工商业家、有知识分子、有中西医、有妇女、有回民，从老解放区来的党政干部只有六个，其余都是土生土长经群众选拔出来的群众领袖，党的干部也等于受了一次群众的鉴定而得到人民的拥护和信任。新的政权正是毛主席所指示的“工人阶级领导的，工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政”在地方政权上的体现，它为全国各地开一个先例。
    市长刘秀峰、副市长臧伯平以他们一年多的政绩为市政府各委员一致拥戴为正、副市长。正象一个代表说的：“刘市长还是刘市长，但他现在是我们二十万人民自己选出来的”。全市人民在这次选举后表现出无比的热忱，一些群众团体到会场献花、献舞、献歌，朗诵着拥护人民自己政府的献词。铁路大厂模范老英雄计根生当选了，工人马上组成秧歌队到计老英雄家去贺喜。大兴纱厂模范女工当选了，女工们高兴的不得了，她们相信女工的生活今后更会有保障。炼焦厂工程师戴锡祉当选了，该厂工人面带喜色传布这个消息，他们表示：积极生产，好好保卫工厂来庆祝大会胜利成功。工商业家当选政府委员的有五个，他们成了街谈巷议中的人物，一家茶叶庄的店员说：“咱们经理当选了，咱柜上劳资两利政策执行的不错，希望他能说服全区各商店经理很好地执行大会决议。”被叫做花子大院的刘家大院选出了一个政府委员，他是回民代表平连，平老头子放了一辈子羊，解放后才丢下鞭杆，成了“老来红”。翻身的农民陆春长也当选了，正象他自己说的“过去的时候，不要说市政府的事，就是村上的事也够不上咱管。”代表们和市民们共同的说出了一句衷心喜悦的话“只有共产党才有真正的民主”。
    大会闭幕了，在工厂、在街区、在郊区的农村代表们正在组织各种形式的集会传达大会的精神和决议。代表们表示要作政府和群众间的桥梁，把大会的决议带到群众中去，把群众意见集中到政府中来。对大会的决议政府各部门已拟出具体实施的计划，有些工作已着手作，有的或已完成了。一个工业化崭新的城市远景已经在石家庄二十万人民的眼前展开了。
