Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, 22nd: The British people are angry, the British ruling class is fearful, other capitalist countries forced to devalue are complaining, and the U.S. monopoly capital group is satisfied after the pound sterling devaluation. The British Communist Party's "Daily Worker" pointed out: "U.S. imperialism demanded devaluation because they want to invest in the overseas colonies of Western European countries. U.S. capitalism is using this crisis to expand its control over other parts of the capitalist world and lower the living standards of European workers." The British Communist Party has called for a widespread campaign to increase wages by 10 to 15 percent to compensate workers for the losses suffered due to the devaluation. The British bourgeoisie, on the other hand, accepted the devaluation news with pain and expressed widespread skepticism about Cripps' bragging that the devaluation would ease the dollar crisis. The Associated Press pointed out: "Even for those who advocate devaluation and feel that devaluation is inevitable, devaluation is shocking news." Reuters admitted: "The undercurrent clearly visible in British newspaper comments is that this is only an expedient measure and not a fundamental solution." According to a report by the Associated Press, London financial figures believe that the disadvantages of the pound sterling devaluation are: (1) It is more expensive to purchase raw materials from the dollar area, and Britain will have to pay more when purchasing dollar goods; (2) To earn the same amount of dollars, it is necessary to export more goods than before. British goods that could earn four dollars in the past will now only earn less than three dollars; (3) When Britain sells the same quantity of goods as in the past, the dollars it receives will be less than in the past, and it will have to work hard to increase exports; (4) Imports will rise in price, which will also increase the price of exports accordingly; (5) The cost of living in Britain will rise. The British ruling class is now trying its best to launch a new attack on the workers in order to extract the profits lost due to the devaluation from the workers. British bourgeois newspapers, represented by "The Times," "Financial Times," "Daily Express," and "Manchester Guardian," unanimously demanded: "Reduce production costs, cut expenditures (referring to social services), and improve production efficiency" to expand British exports.

The French Minister of Finance, Maurice Petsche, who was forced to decide on the devaluation of the franc by the pound sterling devaluation, complained that the devaluation of the pound sterling, especially the severe devaluation, was a "commercial struggle" with other countries.

However, on the U.S. monopoly capital group side, U.S. Treasury Secretary Snyder praised the pound sterling devaluation with satisfaction, saying that it had created a "healthy stimulus" for "worldwide multilateral trade." He believes that the pound sterling devaluation will be in line with the "best interests of the parties concerned," that is, the greatest interests of U.S. capital. Marshall Plan executor Hoffman spoke even more bluntly, revealing the insatiable appetite of U.S. monopoly capital. He hoped that this "bold" measure by Britain would enable European countries to abolish certain import restrictions, abolish foreign exchange controls, and promote tariff reductions. Simultaneously with these official statements, reactionary members of the U.S. Congress are attempting to further intensify pressure on Britain while welcoming it. Senator Marrow believes that such a huge devaluation of the pound sterling is still "hypocritical and dishonest," and he advocates that further devaluation must be implemented. Senator George, Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, made no secret of the U.S. monopoly capital's direct intervention in British internal affairs. He said: "The devaluation of the pound sterling is not enough. It is necessary to first reduce expenditures such as workers' wages."

### 英镑贬值严重危害工人利益　英共号召开展增资运动

　　英镑贬值严重危害工人利益
  　英共号召开展增资运动
    【新华社北平二十二日电】英镑贬值以后，英国人民愤怒，英国统治阶级恐惧，被迫贬值的其他资本主义国家抱怨，而美国独占资本集团则表示满意。英共工人日报指出：“美帝国主义要求贬值，因为他们想在西欧各国的海外殖民地投资。美国资本主义正在利用这一危机扩大它对资本主义世界其他部分的控制，并降低欧洲工人的生活水平。”英国共产党已号召广泛发起增加工资百分之十至十五的运动，以补偿工人由于贬值而蒙受的损失。英国资产阶级则以痛苦的心情接受贬值的消息，而对克里浦斯吹嘘的所谓贬值将缓和美元危机则表示普遍的怀疑。合众社指出：“甚至对那些主张贬值并感觉贬值为无可避免的人们，贬值也是一个震动的消息。”路透社承认：“英国报纸评论中显然可见的潜流，是认为这只是一个权宜之计，并非根本解决的办法。”据合众社电称，伦敦金融界人士认为，英镑贬值的弊端是：（一）向美元区购买原料较贵，英国购买美元货物时将得多付钱；（二）要挣同样的美元时需要输出较以前为多的货物，过去可以挣四美元的英国货物将只能挣到不足三美元；（三）英国出售与过去同等数量的货物时，其所得到的美元将较过去少，并将不得不努力增加输出；（四）输入品将涨价，使输出品的价格也相当提高；（五）英国生活费将上升。英国统治阶级现在竭力想对工人发动新的进攻，以便把因贬值而失去的利润从工人身上榨取回来。以泰晤士报、金融时报、每日快报、曼澈斯特卫报为代表的英国资产阶级报纸，众口一辞地要求：“降低生产成本，削减开支（按指社会服务），提高生产效率”，以扩大英国的出口。
    为英镑贬值所迫而不得不决定法郎贬值的法国财政部长比许，抱怨英镑的贬值，尤其抱怨贬得那样厉害，是同其他国家作“商业斗争”。
    但在美国独占资本集团方面，美国财政部长斯奈德则满意地称赞英镑贬值已为“全世界多边贸易”产生了“健康的刺激”。他认为英镑贬值将符合“有关方面的最大利益”，也就是说美国资本的最大利益。马歇尔计划执行人霍夫曼说得更露骨，他透露了美国独占资本的贪得无厌的胃口，他希望英国这一“果敢的”措施，将使欧洲各国能够取消某些限制进口的措施，取消外汇管制，促成关税的减低。与这些官方发言同时，美国的反动议员们在欢迎之余，正企图进一步加紧对英国的压力。参议员马罗认为英镑这样的巨额贬值，还是“虚伪而不诚实的”，他主张必须进一步地实行贬值。参院财政委员会主席乔治毫不隐讳美国独占资本对英国内政的直接干预，他说：“英镑贬值是不够的，必须首先减少工人工资之类的开支。”
