People's Democratic States Marching Towards Socialism
By You Jin, Member of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, translated by Qiu Jiang

The Second World War, instigated by German and Italian fascists and Japanese imperialists to re-divide the world and establish fascist rule, ended with the complete military and political bankruptcy of its instigators. The Soviet Union and its armed forces played a decisive role in crushing the fascist aggressors.

**The Characteristics of Revolutions in Central and Southeastern Europe**

The entry of the victorious Soviet army—the army of liberation—into Central and Southeastern European countries was the greatest revolutionary factor. As soon as Soviet troops appeared on the territories of these countries, the anti-fascist national liberation war of the masses of people gained a particularly broad scope; all working people also took up arms and fought a life-and-death struggle with the Nazi bandits. The national liberation war merged with the revolutionary struggle of the working people against domestic enemies closely connected with German fascist aggressors. This was a struggle to establish genuine democratic freedom, to implement resolute revolutionary democratic reforms, and for the workers and peasants to seize power.

The working people of Central and Southeastern European countries saw not only the Soviet army, which saved all mankind from the fascist barbaric system, as their liberator from Hitler's tyranny, but also as a force they could rely on to fight against the exploiting classes.

The working class and peasants of Central and Southeastern Europe launched a resolute offensive against the bourgeoisie and landlords. The greatest achievement of the working people was the establishment in these countries of a broad People's Democratic Front, led by communists and left-wing social democrats, to fight against fascism and reactionaries.

The expropriation of landlords' land and the nationalization of industry and banks in these countries between 1945 and 1948 were resolute blows to the main exploiting classes. These measures fundamentally destroyed the economic and political bases of the landlord bourgeoisie.

The characteristic of the period of implementing various revolutionary democratic reforms in these countries was the fierce struggle between political parties representing the interests of various classes. Those parties that had played a considerable role in the early days after the collapse of the fascist dictatorship showed themselves to be reactionary parties, concealing their bourgeois essence with democratic rhetoric. These parties were forces resisting various democratic reforms and seeking to restore the power of the exploiting classes with the help of Anglo-American imperialism.

The working class and peasants abandoned these pseudo-democratic parties and followed the Communist Party. As a result, all these "historically long-standing" and similar parties, which sought to restore capitalism and imperialist oppression, were swept away and thoroughly crushed. However, the struggle was fierce, tenacious, and prolonged.

**The Union of Workers' Parties is a Great Victory for Marxism-Leninism**

In the course of the struggle, the left-wing members of the Social Democratic Party and other parties all united around the Communist Party. The result was the union of the Communist Party and the left wing of the Social Democratic Party into a unified working-class party. This union first took place in Romania, then in Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, and finally, at the end of 1948, in Poland. The Communists put forward the condition of recognizing Marxism-Leninism as the ideological foundation of the future unified workers' party as a condition for the union.

Thus, the union of workers' parties in the People's Democratic countries is a great victory for Marxism-Leninism and a great victory for communist ideology.

After the union, the position of the working class in these countries was greatly consolidated, and it became the leading force in these countries.

The Communist Party resolutely implemented the policy of consolidating the worker-peasant alliance. The people's regime won the trust of the working peasants by carrying out a thorough struggle to eliminate landlord land ownership and distribute land to the peasants. As a result, a strong worker-peasant alliance was formed, with the working class playing a leading role. The establishment of this alliance was the greatest victory of the working class, which created the final establishment of the people's democratic system in Central and Southeastern European countries and its resolute transition to the road of socialist construction.

An analysis of the economic and political development of the People's Democratic countries proves that the basic reforms implemented in these countries are of equal significance to socialist transformation in their nature. The landlord bourgeoisie in these countries has been deprived of political rights, the state power has been seized by the working class and the peasants allied with it, large capitalist property and banks have been confiscated, and landlord land ownership has been eliminated. Therefore, in these countries, the tasks that our Soviet Union's Great October Socialist Revolution had solved have been basically solved.

**Reliable State Organs Must Be Established**

In order for the people's regime to be able to realize its program, it must establish reliable state organs.

So far, in the People's Democratic countries, this state organ has been basically established. The democratization of the army has been resolutely implemented. Now the armed forces of the People's Democratic countries are reliable pillars of the new social system. The essence of the police organs has been fundamentally changed. The police have been replaced by the people's police. The people love and warmly support their army and their people's police.

The task of establishing a new bureaucratic apparatus is more complicated. In the state organs, there are still a number of old officials who harbor malice and sometimes even hostility towards the people's regime. At present, a large number of officials from worker and peasant backgrounds are being trained.

The state power of the People's Democratic countries performs the functions of the dictatorship of the proletariat—ruthlessly suppressing the resistance of the agents of the exploiting classes, who dream of re-imposing the dictatorship of the landlord bourgeoisie and the shackles of imperialist slavery on the people with the help of Anglo-American imperialism.

The People's Democratic countries are increasingly extensively carrying out their functions of organizing the economy and cultural education.

The road that the Central and Southeastern European countries have traveled, which ended with the victory of the people's democratic system, is a road of fierce class struggle, a road of sharp struggles between political parties, and a road of political struggle between the Communist Party and all working people and the agents of the rich peasant bourgeoisie, the mercenaries of Anglo-American imperialism, and nationalist traitors.

Currently, these countries have entered the transitional period from capitalism to socialism. Here there is a socialist economy (such as state-owned industry, cooperatives), a small commodity economy (mainly peasants, handicraftsmen), and a bourgeois economy (mainly commercial bourgeoisie, rich peasants in the countryside). In these countries, the public socialist economy is dominant.

In the People's Democratic countries, a solid economic foundation has been laid for socialist construction—all the main economic and financial positions, foreign trade, and domestic wholesale trade are in the hands of the state. In terms of economic nature and the meaning of social class structure, the People's Democratic countries, in all their fundamental characteristics, are similar to the Soviet Union in the early years of the transitional period, when we were establishing the basic foundation of the socialist economy.

**There Are Two Forms of the Dictatorship of the Proletariat**

Marx wrote in his "Critique of the Gotha Program": "Between capitalist and communist society lies the period of the revolutionary transformation of the one into the other. Corresponding to this is also a political transition period in which the state can be nothing but *the revolutionary dictatorship of the proletariat*."

This point of Marx's is a clear truth for every Marxist-Leninist.

In the People's Democratic countries, the state system that realizes the transition from capitalism to socialism, that is, the state system that exercises the functions of the dictatorship of the proletariat, has been consolidated. The Soviet form of the dictatorship of the proletariat is the highest and most suitable form of political power for the working class. But it does not exclude other organizational forms of this political power. Lenin predicted that the experience of revolutionary struggle would provide many forms of political organization for the working class. The experience of the People's Democratic countries proves that the transition from capitalism to socialism can be achieved in the form of people's democracy.

Therefore, practice proves that there are two forms of the dictatorship of the proletariat: the Soviet form and the People's Democratic form.

The road to socialist construction in the People's Democratic countries has a very important characteristic: if the Soviet state was the only country in the world that embarked on the road of socialist construction in those years, then today the People's Democratic countries are not alone. They have such a powerful fortress, a sincere friend, and a selfless protector as the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union gives them a lot of material and technical assistance. The economic and political mutual relations between the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries are based on complete mutual trust and genuine friendship; this is a new type of relationship—a close relationship, a sincere relationship, a relationship that is only possible between countries where power belongs to the people. For the People's Democratic countries, the Soviet Union is an ally who helped them break the foreign shackles and get rid of the oppression of the landlord bourgeoisie in the past, and now helps them build socialism and protect their security from the harm of foreign monopoly capitalists.

Each People's Democratic country has its own special characteristics in socialist construction due to historical, economic, national, and other reasons. For example, the process of transitioning to socialism in the industrial country of Czechoslovakia and the agricultural country of Bulgaria cannot be measured by the same yardstick. However, the uniqueness of certain tasks facing the various People's Democratic countries does not eliminate the basic and main things that are common to all of them, that is, the road to socialism in all these countries must pass through the dictatorship of the proletariat, through fierce class struggle, through the complete elimination of capitalism, and through the establishment of a socialist system not only in industry but also in agriculture.

**Industrial Nationalization Has Been Solved, and the Peasant Problem Is Being Faced**

The people's regimes in Central and Southeastern Europe have successfully solved the nationalization of industry, grasped the management of industry, and ensured that the socialist economy occupies a dominant position. At present, the most important and most complex task facing the People's Democratic countries is to lay a socialist foundation in agriculture and solve the world-renowned most difficult problem of the socialist revolution—the peasant problem.

As a result of the land reform implemented by the People's Democratic countries, poor and middle peasants received more than 10 million hectares of landlord land. The significance of land reform, which eliminated the land ownership of landlords and large capitalists, is difficult to estimate for these countries.

At present, in the People's Democratic countries, cooperatives—from the most common form of sales cooperatives to production cooperatives—are developing more and more widely.

The state extensively helps poor and middle peasants.

Regarding the attitude towards rich peasants, the People's Democratic countries are currently implementing a policy of restriction and squeezing out. This policy has gained increasing support among the poor and middle peasant classes.

**The Tito Group Implements a Line of Capitalist Restoration**

The nationalists in the People's Democratic countries, especially the traitors of the Tito group, are trying to "prove" that they have discovered a "new way" to enter socialism—without class struggle, still preserving private land ownership. These traitors want to make people believe that it is only necessary to build socialism in the cities, and as for the countryside, it will spontaneously follow the cities together with the rich peasant capitalists. The Tito bandit group has reached the point where they say that the Yugoslav Communist Party is now leading the international revolutionary movement, and other countries should learn from its "experience."

The famous resolution of the Communist and Workers' Parties Information Bureau on the situation of the Yugoslav Communist Party resolutely exposed the traitorous restoration "theory" of the rich peasants peacefully transitioning to socialism, and indicated that this "theory" was stolen from the source of the counter-revolutionary and decadent Bukharin and Trotsky. The Communist Parties of the People's Democratic countries contemptuously discarded the surrender "arguments" of the Tito traitorous group, which had embarked on direct collusion with Anglo-American imperialism, and confidently moved forward along the only correct Marxist-Leninist road of building a socialist society.

The Tito group has openly entered the camp of the enemies of the Soviet Union. They are implementing a line of capitalist restoration domestically in order to turn Yugoslavia into a common bourgeois republic driven by Anglo-American imperialism. The working class and working masses of Yugoslavia are giving increasing resistance to the Tito criminal group.

**The Soviet Union is a Model for Socialist Construction**

The Soviet Union's experience in building socialism is the greatest achievement of the international proletariat. The Soviet Union has victoriously passed through the road from capitalism to socialism and has entered the period of gradual transition from socialism to communism. This richest experience in building a socialist society is a model for the proletariat of other countries. The Soviet Union's experience teaches us that it is impossible to build socialism without the dictatorship of the proletariat. Only after the Communist Party, the Marxist-Leninist party, leads the country can it realize the political leadership sufficient to ensure the smooth construction of socialist society. The road to socialism must pass through fierce class struggle, whether in cities or villages, in the economic field, or in the political and ideological fields. This struggle should ultimately end with the complete elimination of capitalist elements in urban and rural areas and the elimination of the phenomenon of human exploitation.

In the People's Democratic countries, the socialist principle of "from each according to his ability, to each according to his work" is being increasingly firmly established. Although the remnants of capitalism in these countries can still be felt everywhere—in the economy, in ideology, and in lifestyle—efforts have begun to eliminate capitalism and have achieved and consolidated initial great results.

**Only by Forming an Alliance with the Soviet Union and Other People's Democratic Countries Can Socialist Construction Be Built and Completed**

The experience of the Central and Southeastern European countries in transitioning to the road of socialism and the initial major victories achieved on this road prove that now, in any country, it is only possible to build socialism and complete socialist construction on the basis of forming a solid alliance with other countries that have embarked on the road of socialism, and on the basis of forming a solid alliance with the great socialist power—the Soviet Union.

Therefore, the victory of the socialist social structure and the implementation of the principles of the socialist planned economy in many countries in Central and Southeastern Europe is an indisputable fact of worldwide historical significance. If the enemies of socialism had previously tried to make people believe that socialism was just a "purely Russian experiment" and that other European countries would not take this road, then now the facts have proved that socialism is an international phenomenon that has been put on the historical agenda. Only on the road of socialism can the working people, headed by the working class, find a way out of capitalist slavery.

Anglo-American imperialists have declared a desperate offensive against communism and against Marxism-Leninism. Zealously helping them in this dark affair are the loyal servants of imperialism—the right-wing socialists. However, the wheel of history is irresistible. Socialism has already shown itself to be superior to the capitalist system on an international scale. More and more millions of people are standing under the fighting and victorious banner of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin.

### 走向社会主义的人民民主国家

　　走向社会主义的人民民主国家
    苏联科学院会员尤津作  秋江译
    德、意法西斯和日本帝国主义者为着重新分割世界，建立世界法西斯统治所挑起的第二次世界大战，以它的煽动者在军事上和政治上的全部破产而告结束了。在粉碎法西斯侵略者的事业上，苏联和它的武装力量起了决定的作用。
    中欧和东南欧革命的特点
    胜利的苏军——解放者的军队之进入中欧和东南欧国家，乃是最伟大的革命的因素。当苏军部队刚一出现在这些国家的领土上时，人民大众反法西斯的民族解放战争便获得了特别广大的规模；一切劳动人民亦手执武器起而与纳粹匪徒作殊死的斗争。民族解放战争，与劳动人民反对同德国法西斯侵略者有密切联系的国内敌人的革命斗争，汇合起来了。这是为建立真正的民主自由、为实行坚决的革命的民主改革，为工农夺取政权的斗争。
    中欧和东南欧各国的劳动人民，不仅看到从法西斯野蛮制度下拯救了全人类的苏军是使自己摆脱希特勒暴政的解放者，而且是一个可以依靠它来与剥削阶级作斗争的力量。
    中欧和东南欧各国的工人阶级和农民向资产阶级和地主展开了坚决的进攻。劳动人民的最伟大的收获，就是在这些国家里建立了广泛的、以共产党和社会民主党的左翼分子起领导作用的、与法西斯主义及反动派作斗争的人民民主阵线。
    这些国家在一九四五年到一九四八年期间实行剥夺地主的土地和工业及银行之国有化，乃是对主要的剥削阶级的坚决打击。这些措施基本上破坏了地主资产阶级底经济的和政治的地盘。
    在这些国家里实行各种革命的民主改革时期的特点，就是代表各种不同阶级利益的政党之间的残酷的斗争。那些曾在法西斯专政溃灭后的初期起过相当作用的政党，表现了自己是反动的、用民主的辞句来掩盖资产阶级实质的政党。这些政党乃是对抗各种民主改革和力图使依靠英美帝国主义援助的剥削阶级的政权复辟的力量。
    工人阶级和农民抛弃了这些伪民主的党派而跟着共产党走了。结果，所有这些“历史悠久的”、及与其类似的、力求恢复资本主义和帝国主义压迫的政党，全被扫除和被彻底粉碎了。但是，斗争是残酷的、顽强的、长期的。
    各工人政党之联合乃是马列主义的伟大胜利
    在斗争过程中，社会民主党及其他党派的左翼分子全都团结在共产党的周围。结果是共产党与社会民主党的左翼联合为统一的工人阶级政党。这种联合首先发生在罗马尼亚，然后在匈牙利、捷克、保加利亚，最后，在一九四八年年底发生在波兰。共产党人提出了以承认马克思、列宁主义为未来统一工人党的思想基础作为联合的条件。
    这样一来，在人民民主国家内各工人政党之联合，乃是马克思、列宁主义的伟大胜利，乃是共产主义思想的伟大胜利。
    联合之后，这些国家的工人阶级的地位是非常巩固了，它成了这些国家的领导力量。
    共产党坚决不移地实行着巩固工农联盟的政策。人民政权由于进行了消灭地主的土地所有权和把土地分给农民的彻底的斗争而取得了劳动农民的信任。结果形成了牢固的、工人阶级起领导作用的工农联盟。这一联盟之建立，乃是工人阶级的、造成了在中欧和东南欧各国最后确立人民民主制度并使其坚决转入社会主义建设道路底最伟大的胜利。
    在分析各人民民主国家的经济与政治发展时证明，在这些国家所实行的各种基本改革，就其性质来说，与社会主义的转变具有同等的意义。这些国家的地主资产阶级被剥夺了政治权利，国家政权为工人阶级及与它结成联盟的农民夺得了，大的资本主义财产和银行被没收了，地主的土地所有权被消灭了。因此，在这些国家里，基本上已经解决了我们苏联伟大十月社会主义革命所曾解决的那些任务。
    必须建立起可靠的国家机构
    要使人民政权能得以实现自己的政纲，它就必须建立起可靠的国家机构。
    到目前为止，在人民民主国家里，这一国家机构基本上已经建立起来了。坚决地实行了军队民主化。现在各人民民主国家的武装力量，乃是新的社会制度底可靠支柱。根本改变了警察机关的实质。以民警代替了警察。人民热爱与热烈拥护自己的军队和自己的民警。
    比较复杂的是建立新的官吏机构的任务。在国家机关里依然保存着一批旧的官员，这些人心怀恶意，而有时甚至敌视人民政权。目前正进行着大批培养工农出身的官员的工作。
    各人民民主国家的国家政权执行着无产阶级专政的职能——无情的镇压剥削阶级的代理人的反抗，他们幻想着在英美帝国主义帮助下重新把地主资产阶级专政和帝国主义奴隶制度的枷锁加在人民身上。
    各人民民主国家正日益广泛地实行其组织经济及文化教育的职能。
    中欧和东南欧各国所走过的、并以人民民主制度之胜利而告终结的道路——乃是残酷的阶级斗争的道路，是各党派尖锐斗争的道路，是共产党及一切劳动人民与富农资产阶级的代理人、与英美帝国主义的雇佣者、与民族主义叛徒等作政治斗争的道路。
    目前这些国家已进入到由资本主义过渡到社会主义的过渡时期。在这里有社会主义的经济（如国营工业、合作社），有小商品经济（主要是农民、手工业者），有资产阶级的经济（主要是商业资产阶级，农村中的富农）。在这些国家里占统治地位的是公共的社会主义经济。
    在各人民民主国家里已为社会主义建设奠定了牢固的经济基础——一切主要的经济和财政阵地、对外贸易和国内批发贸易，全掌握在国家手里。从经济性质和社会的阶级结构的含意上来说，各人民民主国家在其一切根本的特征上，均与过渡时期初年的苏联相似，那时正是我们建立社会主义经济的基本基础的时期。
    无产阶级专政有两种形式
    马克思在其“哥达纲领批判”一书中写道：“在资本主义社会与共产主义社会之间存在着前者革命地转变为后者的时期。适应这一时期的是政治的过渡时期，而这一时期的国家，除了无产阶级的革命专政之外，不可能是其他别的东西”。
    马克思的这一论点，对于每一个马克思、列宁主义者来说，乃是一个明明白白的真理。
    在各人民民主国家里，实现由资本主义过渡到社会主义的国家制度，也即是实行无产阶级专政职能的国家制度，已得到了巩固。苏维埃形式的无产阶级专政，是工人阶级底最高的、最适宜的政权形式。但它并不排除这一政权的其他组织形式。列宁曾预言说，革命斗争的经验将提供出许多的工人阶级的政治组织形式。各人民民主国家的经验证明，实现由资本主义过渡到社会主义可以采用人民民主的形式。
    因此，实践证明，无产阶级专政有两种形式：苏维埃的形式和人民民主的形式。
    在人民民主国家内的社会主义建设的道路，有着一个非常主要的特点：如果说苏维埃国家在当年是世界唯一无二的走上社会主义建设道路底国家的话，那么今天各人民民主国家就不是孤独的了。它们有苏联这样一个强大的堡垒、真诚的朋友、和大公无私的保卫者。苏联给它们大量的物质和技术的帮助。苏联与各人民民主国家之间的经济上和政治上的相互关系，是建立在彼此完全信任与真正友好的基础上的；这是一种新型的关系——亲近的关系、真心诚意的关系，只有在政权归于人民的国家之间才有可能的关系。苏联，对于人民民主国家来说，乃是一个同盟者，这个同盟者过去帮助它们打碎了外国的枷锁，摆脱了地主资产阶级的压迫，而现在又在帮助它们建设社会主义，保护它们的安全，使其不受外国垄断资本家所谋害。
    每一个人民民主国家，由于历史、经济、民族、及其他种种原因，以致于在社会主义的建设中各有其特殊的特点。比方说，在工业国的捷克和在农业国的保加利亚，绝不能拿同一尺度去衡量它们的过渡到社会主义的过程。但是，摆在各个不同的人民民主国家面前的任务底某些独特之处，并没有去掉基本的、主要的、对它们全体来说又是共同的东西，这就是所有这些国家走向社会主义的道路都必须经过无产阶级专政，经过残酷的阶级斗争，经过彻底消灭资本主义，以及不仅要在工业方面，而且要在农业方面确立起社会主义制度的道路。
    已解决了工业国有化正面临解决农民问题
    在中欧和东南欧各国的人民政权已顺利地解决了工业国有化，掌握了对工业的管理，保证了社会主义经济占统治地位。目前摆在各人民民主国家面前的最重要的和最复杂的任务是：在农业方面奠定社会主义基础，解决为举世皆知的、社会主义革命最困难的问题——农民问题。
    由于各人民民主国家实行了土地改革的结果，贫农和中农得到了一千多万公顷的地主土地。土地改革消灭了地主和大资本家的土地所有权，其伟大意义对这些国家来说是很难估计的。
    目前在各人民民主国家内，合作社——从最普通形式的贩卖合作社到生产合作社——正得到日益更加广泛的发展。
    国家广泛地帮助贫农和中农。
    对富农的态度，各人民民主国家目前所实行的是限制和排挤的政策。这一政策在贫农和中农阶层中间得到益加广泛的支持。
    铁托集团实行着使资本主义复辟的路线
    在各人民民主国家内的民族主义分子，首先是铁托集团的叛徒们，这帮人企图“证明”他们发现了走进社会主义的“新途径”——不经过阶级斗争，依然保存着土地私有制。这些叛徒们想叫人们相信，只需要在城市建设社会主义，至于农村呢，则与富农资本主义分子一起自发地跟着城市走。铁托匪帮集团竟达到这个地步，他们说南斯拉夫共产党现在正领导着国际革命运动，其他国家都应当向它的“经验”看齐。
    共产党和工人党情报局关于南斯拉夫共产党状况的著名决议，坚决地揭穿了富农和平转入社会主义的叛卖性的复辟“理论”，指示了这种“理论”是窃取自反革命的、腐朽的布哈林和托洛茨基的源泉的。各人民民主国家的共产党鄙视地抛弃了这一已经走上直接与英美帝国主义勾结的铁托叛卖集团底投降“论据”，和自信地沿着唯一正确的马克思、列宁主义建设社会主义社会的道路前进。
    铁托集团已公开投入苏联的敌人的阵营了。它们在国内实行使资本主义复群的路线，以求达到变南斯拉夫为通常的、受英美帝国主义驱使的资产阶级共和国。南斯拉夫的工人阶级和劳苦大众正对铁托犯罪集团给以越来越大的反抗。
    苏联是走向社会主义建设的榜样
    苏联建设社会主义的经验，乃是国际无产阶级底最伟大的成果。苏联胜利地走过了由资本主义到社会主义的道路，并进入了由社会主义逐渐过渡到共产主义的时期。这一最丰富的建设社会主义社会的经验，是其他国家的无产阶级底榜样。苏联的经验教导我们说，没有无产阶级专政是不可能建设社会主义的。只有共产党，马克思，列宁主义的党领导国家之后，才能实现足以保证顺利建设社会主义社会的政治领导。走向社会主义的道路，无论在城市和乡村，无论在经济方面，以及在政治和思想方面，都必须经过残酷的阶级斗争。这一斗争归根到底，应当是以全部消灭城乡的资本主义分子和消灭人剥削人的现象而告终的。
    在人民民主国家内正日益牢固地确立着社会主义的“各尽所能，各取所值”的原则。虽然在这些国家里资本主义的遗迹依然到处——在经济上、在思想上、在生活习惯上——可以感觉得出来，但已开始着手消灭资本主义，而且获得了和巩固了初步的巨大成绩。
    只有与苏联及其他人民民主国家结成联盟才有可能建设和完成社会主义建设
    中欧和东南欧各国过渡到社会主义道路上的经验和在这条道路上所获得的初步的重大胜利证明着：现在在任何国家内，只有在与其他已经走上社会主义道路的国家结成牢固联盟的基础上，只有在与伟大社会主义强国——苏联结成牢固联盟的基础上，才有可能建设社会主义和完成社会主义建设。
    因此，社会主义社会结构及实行社会主义计划经济诸原则在中欧和东南欧许多国家之赢得胜利，乃是一个无可争辩的、具有全世界历史意义的事实。倘若从前社会主义的敌人曾企图使人们相信社会主义不过是“纯粹俄国的实验”，其他欧洲国家是不会走这条路的，那么，现在事实已经证明了，社会主义乃是国际的现象，它已经被历史提到议事日程上来了，以工人阶级为首的劳动人民，只有在社会主义道路上，才能找到逃脱资本主义奴役的出路。
    英美帝国主义者宣布了反共产主义，反马克思、列宁主义的拼命进攻。在这一黑暗的勾当上，热心帮助他们的是帝国主义底忠实的从仆—右翼社会党人。但是，历史前进的车轮是不可抗拒的。社会主义已经在国际范围内表现出自己优于资本主义制度。愈来愈多的千百万的人们都站到马、恩、列、斯底战斗的胜利的旗帜之下。
