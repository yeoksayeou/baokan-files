　　Xinhua News Agency, Central China Front, 3rd: On August 29th, the People's Liberation Army on the Central China Front liberated Ningdu County, Jiangxi. Over 3,000 remnant bandits fled westward from the city.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Central China Front, 3rd: The People's Liberation Army's Two-Guangdong Column has vowed to march south and participate in the great historical task of liberating Guangdong and Guangxi. After receiving the order to march south some days ago, the entire army was filled with excitement. When the unit received news during its southward march that the South China guerrillas had advanced to the Guangdong-Jiangxi border and victoriously joined forces with the southward field army, the soldiers were overjoyed and demanded to march south at double speed to cooperate with the brotherly units in swiftly liberating Guangdong and Guangxi. It is noted that the Two-Guangdong Column was originally the East River Guerrilla Force of Guangdong, which persisted in anti-Japanese guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines in Guangdong during the War of Resistance Against Japan and achieved remarkable military exploits. In July 1946, in order to strive for national peace, it reluctantly withdrew north to Shandong. After a year of study, it was ordered on August 1, 1947, to form the Two-Guangdong Column and went to the East China battlefield to participate in the operations to crush the key offensives of the Kuomintang bandit army. In 1948, it participated in the famous Yudu, Jinan, and Huaihai campaigns under the command of the Third Field Army.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Kaifeng, 2nd: A certain unit of the Fourth Field Army of the People's Liberation Army swiftly and courageously encircled and annihilated the bandit "Yu-Xi剿匪总指挥部 (Yu-Xi Bandit Suppression Headquarters)" south of Lushi on the 18th. Deputy Commander and Commander of the New Second Division, Ren Taisheng's, unit was completely wiped out in just one hour of combat. The bandit leader, Ren Taisheng, and over 450 others were captured alive. Thirteen light and heavy machine guns, over 150 rifles, and two mortars and 60mm guns were seized. Furthermore, in July, the Henan Provincial Liberation Army focused on bandit suppression in the Shan (zhou)-Luo (yang) area and the Huangchuan, Nanyang, and other sub-districts, engaging in a total of 140 battles of varying scales. They successively defeated major bandit forces under the jurisdiction of the pseudo "Yu-Xi Bandit Suppression Headquarters," such as the New First Division and the New Second Division, eliminating a total of 3,883 bandits. Among them, 2,703 bandits, including the "Yellow River Detachment" Captain of the New First Division, Di Wenbin, were captured, and 851 bandits, including the Deputy Commander of the New Second Division, Wang Zixian, and the Commanders of the Second and Fourth Regiments, Li Xuewu and Xiao Hongzhi, surrendered. The Liberation Army seized 9,655 rifles, 104 light and heavy machine guns, seven 60mm guns, four mortars, eight small cannons, over 90,000 rounds of ammunition, and over 1,000 shells.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 3rd: The Hunan Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army was established on August 30th by order of the Military Commission of the People's Revolutionary Army of China. Xiao Jingguang is the commander, Huang Kecheng is the political commissar, Chen Mingren and Han Xianchu are the deputy commanders, and Jin Ming and Tang Tianji are the deputy political commissars. Among the military sub-districts under the Hunan Military Region, the Changsha, Changde, and Yiyang military sub-districts have already been established.
