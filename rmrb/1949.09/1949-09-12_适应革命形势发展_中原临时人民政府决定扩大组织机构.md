　　Adapting to the Development of the Revolutionary Situation
　　Central Plains Provisional People's Government Decides to Expand its Organizational Structure
    Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 11th: In order to adapt to the development of the revolutionary situation, the Central Plains Provisional People's Government has decided to expand its organizational structure. The Central Plains Provisional People's Government held its third administrative meeting on the 5th of this month. Chairman Deng Zihui explained the current new situation at the meeting, pointing out that since the establishment of the Central Plains Provisional People's Government in March of this year, the situation has undergone great changes. The People's Liberation Army has liberated major and medium-sized cities such as Wuhan, Yichang, Shashi, Nanchang, Jiujiang, Ji'an, Ganzhou, Changsha, and Changde, as well as vast areas. During the victorious advance of the army, the six provinces and one city of Central China will soon be completely liberated and unified. This fundamental change in the situation has put forward new requirements for the current government work, namely, the need for a more complete organization to uniformly lead the work in various regions, especially the need to first restore and expand the leading organizations for finance, industry and commerce, transportation, education, etc., in order to cooperate with the current situation. Chairman Deng pointed out that according to the government organizational principles, changes in government structure should be decided by the People's Representative Conference. Since the war in Hunan has not yet ended and Guangdong and Guangxi are yet to be liberated, it is not possible to convene the Central China People's Representative Conference at present. However, it is imperative to expand the organizational structure and enrich the Central Plains Provisional People's Government. Chairman Deng then proposed that, in addition to restoring the original ministries of civil affairs, justice, transportation, education, agriculture, and the secretariat, the current financial and economic department should be divided into a Ministry of Finance, a Ministry of Industry, and a Ministry of Commerce, and a Ministry of Health should be added. He also proposed that Xu Lin be the Minister of Finance, Zhu Yi be the Minister of Industry, Zeng Zhi and Gao Yuangui be the Deputy Ministers, Fan Xingzhi and Zeng Chuanliu be the Minister and Deputy Minister of Commerce, Liu Huinong and Wu Zili be the Minister and Deputy Minister of Transportation, Bu Shengguang be the Minister of Public Security, Pan Zinian be the Minister of Education, Sun Yizhi concurrently serve as the Minister of Health, and Wei Jinfei be the Secretary-General. Chairman Deng's proposal was unanimously approved after discussion at the meeting.

　　适应革命形势发展
　  中原临时人民政府决定扩大组织机构
    【新华社汉口十一日电】中原临时人民政府为适应革命形势的发展，决定扩大组织机构。中原临时人民政府曾于本月五日召开第三次政务会议，邓子恢主席曾在会上说明目前的新形势时指出：中原临时人民政府自今年三月间成立以来，形势已发生很大变化，解放军已解放了武汉、宜昌、沙市、南昌、九江、吉安、赣州、长沙、常德等大中城市，和广大地区。在大军胜利进军中，华中六省一市不久即将全部解放和统一。这一基本形势的变化，对目前政府工作提出了新的要求，即要求一个更健全的机构来统一领导各地的工作，特别须要首先恢复和扩大财政、工商、交通、教育等领导机构，才能和当前形势相配合。邓主席指出：照政府组织原则，改变政府编制应由人民代表会来决定。由于目前湖南战争尚未结束，两广尚待解放，目前尚不能召开华中人民代表会议，但目前又非扩大组织机构，充实中原临时人民政府不可。邓主席继即提议：除恢复原有的民政、司法、交通、教育、农业各部和秘书厅外，将现在的财政经济部分为财政部、工业部、商业部，并另加设一卫生部。他并提议徐林为财政部长，朱毅为工业部长，曾志、高元贵为副部长，范醒之、曾传六为正副商业部长，刘惠农、吴自立为正副交通部长，卜盛光为公安部长，潘梓年为教育部长，孙宜之兼卫生部长，魏今非为秘书长。邓主席这一提议，经会议讨论后获得一致通过。
