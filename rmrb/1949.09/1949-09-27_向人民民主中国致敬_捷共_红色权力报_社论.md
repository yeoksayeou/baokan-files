Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 26th: The Czech Communist Party's official newspaper, "Red Power," published an editorial on the 24th entitled "Saluting the People's Democratic China." The full text is as follows:

　　The announcement by Mao Zedong, Chairman of the Chinese Communist Party, of the establishment of the People's Republic of China, signifies the completion of the heroic Chinese people's struggle against domestic and foreign oppressors for over a century. This nation, with a population of 475 million and a territory of over 9.59 million square kilometers, is becoming a firm and increasingly powerful part of the world's anti-imperialist peace force camp, led by the Soviet Union.

　　Our camp, which guarantees peace and progress for humanity and enables all people to embark on a joyful and free life, has increased by almost a quarter of the total human population thanks to the victory of the various ethnic groups of China and the establishment of the People's Republic of China. At this moment, we all feel the profound importance of the brilliant passage in the speech of Mao Zedong, the great teacher and leader of the Chinese people. This passage says: "Our work will be written into human history, and it will show that the Chinese, who account for a quarter of the total human population, have stood up." We all recognize that after the victory of the great October Revolution and the decisive victory of the Soviet Union and peaceful humanity over the fascist aggressors in World War II, today's victory of the Chinese people over the Kuomintang traitorous reactionaries and Anglo-American imperialists is the most important and far-reaching historical event of this century.

　　In the three years of the Chinese people's struggle for people's liberation, the heroic People's Liberation Army has been able to crush the attacks of millions of Kuomintang reactionary government troops supported by American imperialists and turn to counter-offensive and offensive. It is an army born in astonishingly difficult battles and hardships, an army whose core is a force that participated in the glorious and heroic "Long March" under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. The Chinese people have united to support the People's Liberation Army's war of liberation, helping it everywhere; in areas still under Kuomintang rule, guerrilla warfare is surging, accelerating the demise of the Kuomintang. Almost every day there are reports of the remaining Kuomintang troops surrendering en masse to the People's Liberation Army and requesting to be allowed to fight against the remaining oppressors. This victorious army, which has created all the conditions for the establishment of the People's Democratic Republic, is a team of fighters and builders, a team that immediately organizes the economic, political and cultural life of the liberated areas, an army that itself participates in the necessary shock work to ensure the welfare of the people.

　　Without the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the party of Comrades Mao Zedong, Zhu De, Liu Shaoqi, and Zhou Enlai, the great victory of the Chinese People's Liberation Army would in no way have been possible. This party has been constantly learning, and is learning, from the experience of the glorious Bolshevik Party of Lenin and Stalin. On the 28th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese Communist Party, Comrade Mao Zedong said that the great victory of the Chinese people is the result of a consistent policy based on Marxism-Leninism. Regarding this, Comrade Mao Zedong said in his speech, "The great October Revolution pointed out the path for the Chinese working class." On this historically significant anniversary, the Chairman of the Chinese Communist Party wrote in an article, "If there were no Soviet Union and its victory over fascism, if there were no defeat of Japanese imperialism, if there were no existence of the European People's Democratic countries, if there were no ever-developing liberation struggle of the oppressed nations of the East, if there were no mass struggles in the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and other capitalist countries, if there were none of these events, then the international reactionary forces piled on our heads would be much heavier."

　　In this profound spirit of proletarian internationalism, the Chinese Communist Party leads the Chinese people from victory to victory. This party has never lost contact with the masses and constantly learns from the experiences of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Communist Parties of other countries. After the Information Bureau's resolution on Yugoslavia was published, this resolution was used as the basis for education in all organizations of the Chinese party, in the army, in factories and villages.

　　The Chinese Communist Party under the leadership of Mao Zedong is not only able to organize victorious operations on the battlefield, but also able to solve the enormous and difficult construction tasks of the liberated areas. The Chinese Communist Party has been able to unite all the Chinese people on the basis of its program against traitors, against Japanese aggressors and against American imperialists, and has added such a great force to the world's peace and democracy camp that the People's Republic of China is now able to declare its establishment, primarily because of the success of this party in China.

　　Compared with this great victory, how miserable is the situation of those who have suffered unprecedented and greatest defeats in China! American imperialists have been forced to admit that their military intervention, air and naval bases, and policy of gold-yuan imperialism have suffered an unprecedentedly tragic defeat in China today. The grand plan of Wall Street, supported by billions of gold yuan, tanks, planes and cruisers, military experts and advisors, has not been realized. The utter failure of imperialism in China shows to all mankind that even the most modern equipment in the hands of a countable few exploiters is completely powerless in the face of the united will of a fighting people, and that all imperialist plans are doomed to fail from the outset.

　　American imperialists know full well that losing China means a sharp aggravation of the economic situation for them, because the Chinese market could have become one of the most important sources of profit for Wall Street tycoons. Therefore, American imperialists and their accomplices will have to gnash their teeth helplessly when they hear the news of the proclamation of the People's Republic of China.

　　However, the peace-loving masses of the world will greet this joyous news in a completely different way. The countries united in the camp of peace and socialism will welcome the People's Democratic China as their new and powerful ally. In particular, the new China has opened up a joyful prospect for the fighting masses of colonial countries.

　　That is why the Czechoslovak people also congratulate the fraternal people of the People's Democratic China at this glorious moment, the victors who defeated the imperialists and colonialists and a member of the powerful camp of peace and progress, led by the invincible Soviet Union, guiding the nations towards a happy future.

### 向人民民主中国致敬　捷共“红色权力报”社论

　　向人民民主中国致敬
  　捷共“红色权力报”社论
    【新华社布拉格二十六日电】捷克斯洛伐克共产党机关报红色权力报二十四日发表社论，题为“向人民民主中国致敬”。全文如下：
    中国共产党主席毛泽东的宣布中华人民共和国成立，表示英勇的中国人民百余年来反对国内外压迫者的斗争已臻完成。这个拥有四亿七千五百万人口和九百五十九万余平方公里领土的国家，正变成在苏联领导下的，世界反帝和平力量阵营的一个坚定而越来越强大的部分。
    我们的阵营，给人类保证着和平与进步，使一切人民能够开始走上欢欣自由之生活的阵营，由于中国各族人民的胜利与中华人民共和国的成立，已经增大了几乎人类总数的四分之一。我们大家在此时际都感到中国人民的伟大导师与领袖毛泽东演说中辉煌的一段所具有的深刻的重要性。这一段说：“我们的工作将写在人类的历史上，它将表明：占人类总数四分之一的中国人从此站立起来了。”我们大家都认识到：在胜利的伟大十月革命及苏联与和平人类在第二次世界大战中对法西斯侵略者的决定性的胜利之后，今天中国人民对其国内蒋介石国民党卖国反动派与英美帝国主义者的胜利，便是本世纪内最重要和影响最深远的历史事件。
    在中国人民进行人民解放斗争的三年中，英勇的人民解放军能够粉碎了受美帝国主义者支持的国民党反动政府数百万军队的进攻，并且转入反攻和进攻。它是一支在惊人困难的战斗与艰苦中诞生的军队，一支由曾在中国共产党领导下参加了光荣英勇的“长征”的队伍为其核心的军队。中国人民已经团结起来，支援人民解放军的解放战争，到处都在帮助它；仍在国民党统治下的地区，游击战争风起云涌，加速着国民党的灭亡。几乎每天都传来关于残余国民党军队整军投诚人民解放军，和要求也准许他们对残余的压迫者作战的消息。已经创造了使人民民主共和国能以成立的一切条件的这支胜利的军队，是一支战斗者、建设者的队伍，一支立刻组织各解放区的经济、政治和文化生活的队伍，一支它自己就参加必要的突击工作，以保证人民福利的军队。
    如果没有中国共产党，毛泽东、朱德、刘少奇和周恩来同志的党的领导，中国人民解放军的伟大胜利无论如何是不可能的。这个党曾不断学习，而且正在学习列宁和斯大林的光荣布尔什维克党的经验。在中国共产党成立二十八周年纪念那天，毛泽东同志说，中国人民的伟大胜利乃是一贯的基于马克思列宁主义的政策的结果。关于这一点，毛泽东同志在他的讲演中说，“伟大的十月革命给中国工人阶级指示了道路。”就在这一有历史意义的周年纪念日，中国共产党主席在一篇文章中写道，“假如没有苏联及其对法西斯的胜利，假如没有打败日本帝国主义，假如没有欧洲人民民主国家的存在，假如没有东方被压迫民族的日益发展的解放斗争，假如没有美、英、法、德、意、日及其他资本主义国家的群众斗争，假如没有这一切事件，那么，堆在我们头上的国际反动势力就要沉重得多”。
    在这种深湛的无产阶级国际主义的精神之中，中国共产党领导着中国人民从胜利走向胜利。这个党从来没有失去和群众的联系，而且经常从苏联共产党和其他国家的共产党的经验中吸取教训。在情报局关于南斯拉夫的决议发表之后，这个决议便被用作在中国党的一切组织中、在军队中、在工厂和村庄里，进行教育的根据。
    在毛泽东领导下的中国共产党，不仅能够组织战场上的胜利的作战，并且也能够解决解放区的巨大而又困难的建设任务。中国共产党能够以其反对卖国贼、反对日本侵略者和反对美国帝国主义者的政纲为基础而团结全中国人民，并且给世界和平民主阵营增加了那样巨大的力量，中华人民共和国现在之所以能够宣告成立，首先是由于这一个党在中国的成功。
    与这种伟大胜利相形之下，那些在中国蒙受了空前最大败绩的家伙们的情境是多么悲惨啊！美国帝国主义者已迫不得已地承认：他们的军事干涉、空军与海军基地和金元帝国主义的政策，今天在中国蒙受了空前悲惨的失败。华尔街的为亿万金元、坦克、飞机和巡洋舰、军事专家和顾问们所支持的宏大计划并没有实现。帝国主义在中国的一败涂地的失败向全人类显示：在屈指可数的少许剥削者手上的即使是最现代化的装备，在一个战斗人民的统一意志面前也是完全无能为力的，并且一切帝国主义的计划从头就注定了要失败的。
    美帝国主义者深知，失去中国对他们来说，意味着经济情势的尖锐化，因为中国的市场本来是可以成为华尔街大亨获利的最重要的源泉之一的。因此美国帝国主义者及其帮凶在听到中华人民共和国宣告成立的消息的时候，将只好无可奈何地咬牙切齿。
    然而，全世界和平的人民群众，将以截然不同的方式来迎接这一愉快的消息。团结在和平与社会主义阵营的国家，将欢迎人民民主的中国，看作是它们的新的强大的同盟者。尤其是新中国已为殖民地国家的战斗的群众打开了一幅愉快的远景。
    这就是为什么捷克斯洛伐克人民也在这光荣的时刻，祝贺着人民民主中国的兄弟人民，打败了帝国主义者和殖民者的胜利者和以无敌的苏联为首的、引导着各民族走向幸福的未来的、强大的和平与进步阵营的一员。
