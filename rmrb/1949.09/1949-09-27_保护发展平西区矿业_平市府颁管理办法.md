　　Protecting and Developing the Mining Industry in Pingxi District
  　Ping Municipality Issues Management Regulations
    [Ping Municipal News] In order to carry out long-term economic construction and protect and develop the coal mining industry, the Beijing Municipal People's Government has recently promulgated the "Provisional Regulations (Draft) for the Administration of Coal Mining in Pingxi District" for trial implementation. The regulations stipulate that "all mineral deposits within this district must not be exploited without applying for mining rights registration in accordance with these regulations, being approved by the competent authority, and obtaining a license. During the mining period, they must be subject to government supervision and guidance." Anyone who has obtained mining rights before the promulgation of these regulations must re-apply for registration; those who are already mining should also apply for registration within two months, otherwise the application will be invalid. Those who exploit without approval will be ordered to stop mining immediately and will be fined a certain amount. The regulations stipulate that applicants for mining rights in the same mining area, those using mechanized mining have priority registration rights (if both are mechanized mining, they will be approved in order of priority). Applicants for mining rights shall not lease them out privately or over-exploit them without a plan after obtaining the mining license. Each coal mine shall submit its construction progress and business status to the local competent authority and the Beijing Municipal Government for review in four installments in March, June, September, and December each year. When necessary, the local competent authority and the Beijing Municipal Government may send personnel to inspect the coal mine. The government retains the priority right to purchase any mineral products, and mine developers shall not refuse. The regulations make clear provisions on the scope of mining areas and mining rights, and strictly prohibit over-the-boundary mining. All losses caused by crossing the boundary shall be borne by the perpetrator, and a fine may be imposed. Those who deliberately damage the mining area, set fires, or release water that affects production shall be held liable for compensation and shall be handed over to the court for handling depending on the seriousness of the circumstances.
