Xinhua News Agency, Northwest Front, 3rd: More than a thousand Hui and Uyghur people in Lanzhou held a grand meeting at the "Mosque" in Nanmen on the morning of August 31st to celebrate liberation and welcome the People's Liberation Army. Han Liancheng and Ren Qian, deputy directors of the Military Control Commission, and Sun Jianfeng, deputy mayor, attended. Green religious flags were hung high on both sides of the meeting place's entrance, and wooden pillars were plastered with slogans such as "The People's Liberation Army brings great freedom!" and "The People's Liberation Army is the savior of the Hui people!" The parishioners of the twenty-four districts, wearing white and black religious caps, marched in formation, holding red and green flags, into the venue. The meeting began after the morning prayer.

In their speeches, worker representative Ma Deyi and Lanzhou University professor Wu Hongye both pointed out that the Kuomintang bandit gang and the Ma bandits' lies of "The Communist Party will destroy Islam and kill the Hui people" cannot withstand the facts. After liberation, the Hui people have obtained true ethnic equality, freedom, and happiness, and today's gathering is the best illustration of this. Professor Wu also vehemently denounced the Hui traitors Ma Bufang and Ma Hongkui for using the protection of religion to deceive the Hui people and forcibly conscripting people between the ages of fifteen and fifty to serve as cannon fodder for them. He said passionately, "Now that we are liberated, Hui compatriots must actively support the People's Liberation Army and thoroughly eliminate the cruel and tyrannical Hui bandits, the Ma clique." Uyghur representative Ai Maiti said, "We liberated Uyghurs all hope that the People's Liberation Army will advance into Xinjiang soon to save the ethnic minorities in Xinjiang who are still under the rule and oppression of the Kuomintang bandit gang."

Han Liancheng, deputy director of the Military Control Commission, pointed out that the reactionaries want to create contradictions and animosity between the Hui and Han people to maintain their rule. The past hatred between the Hui and Han nationalities was caused by reactionary rule. In the future, the Hui and Han people should unite to overthrow our common enemies, Hu Zongnan, Ma Hongkui, and Ma Bufang. Sun Zuobin, a member of the Military Control Commission, proposed that Zongtang Gate, Zuo Highway, and Dingxi Road in Lanzhou are records of the crimes of the executioner Zuo Zongtang's massacre of the Hui people. Now that Lanzhou is liberated, they should be renamed. His proposal was immediately greeted with cheers from the audience.

The congress unanimously passed a telegram of respect to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu before concluding. The telegram read as follows:

Dear Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu:

Lanzhou was victoriously liberated on August 26th. We, who have been oppressed for thousands of years, have gained freedom and happiness from now on. Today, we celebrate our liberation in unprecedented cheers. This is the first joy and happiness we have ever had, brought to us by the great People's Liberation Army. From now on, all the Hui people in our Lanzhou are willing to actively support the front under the leadership of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu and fight to the end to completely annihilate the remaining Ma bandit troops and liberate the entire Northwest and all of China. We hereby send our respects.

　　拥护我党少数民族政策
  　兰州回胞举行盛会
  　庆祝解放欢迎我军
    电毛主席朱总司令致敬
    【本报讯】据新华社西北前线三日电：兰州市千余回族、维善尔族人民，于八月三十一日上午，在南门“清真寺”举行庆祝解放暨欢迎人民解放军盛会，军管会副主任韩练成、任谦，副市长孙剑峰等均出席参加。会场门前两侧高悬绿色教旗，两旁木柱张贴着“解放军带来了伟大的自由！”“人民解放军是回胞的救星！”等标语。二十四坊的教民，戴着白黑色的教帽，排着队，手执红绿旗进入会场。会议在晨拜后开始。工人代表马德义和兰州大学教授吴鸿业在讲话中都指出：国民党匪帮与马匪所说“共产党灭回教，杀回回”的谎言是不堪事实一击的。解放后，回族得到真正的民族平等、自由与幸福，今天的集会就是最好的说明。吴教授并痛斥回奸马步芳、马鸿逵拿保护教门来愚弄回族人民，强逼十五岁以上五十岁以下的人去替他当兵充炮灰。他激昂地说：“现在我们解放了，回族同胞要积极支援解放军，彻底消灭残酷暴戾的回奸马匪。”维善尔族代表艾迈提说：“我们已解放的维善尔人，都希望解放军很快地进军新疆，去拯救新疆还在国民党匪帮统治压迫下的少数民族。”军管会副主任韩练成指出：反动派就是要造成回汉之间的矛盾和仇视，来维持他的统治。过去回汉民族间存在的仇恨，都是反动统治所造成的，今后回汉人民应该团结起来，打倒共同的敌人胡宗南、马鸿逵、马步芳。军管会委员孙作滨提出：兰州市的宗棠门、左公路、定西路是刽子手左宗棠屠杀回民的罪恶纪录，兰州解放了，应该另改别名，他的提议立刻获得会场欢呼。大会于一致通过向毛主席、朱总司令致敬电后结束。电文如下：亲爱的毛主席、朱总司令：
    八月二十六日兰州胜利解放，数千年受压迫的我们，从此获得了自由与幸福。今天我们在盛况空前的欢呼声中庆祝我们的解放，这是我们有生以来第一次的欢乐与愉快，这是伟大人民解放军带给我们的。今后我们兰州市的全体回民愿在毛主席、朱总司令的领导下，积极支援前线，为全歼残余马匪军、为解放全西北全中国而奋斗到底。特电致敬。
