North China Cotton Improvement Office
　　Closes Seed Cotton Quality Preservation Meeting
　　Resolutely Implement the Policy of Paying Higher Prices for High-Quality Cotton
　　Fully Guarantee the Supply of Raw Materials for Industry
[Report from this newspaper] The regional seed cotton quality preservation meeting convened by the North China People's Government's Ministry of Agriculture Cotton Improvement Office, after seven days of reports and discussions, successfully concluded yesterday (the 9th). At the closing meeting, Zhang Chong, Deputy Minister of Agriculture, spoke first, saying: Under the rule of the Kuomintang's reactionary and traitorous government, not only did industrial products rely on the United States, but also the raw materials for the textile industry mostly relied on American cotton. It is not difficult to imagine the extent of this colonial behavior. If we want to transform China from an agricultural country into an industrial country, we must solve the cotton problem. We have established the Cotton Improvement Office and ginneries, and vigorously promoted improved cotton varieties. On the one hand, this can bring great economic benefits to farmers, and on the other hand, it can ensure a sufficient supply of raw materials for the textile industry. Regarding the purpose of this meeting, he clearly pointed out: The purpose of purchasing cotton is to preserve its quality. If the ginnery is regarded as a profit-making organization, attempting to suppress cotton prices and exploit cotton farmers, it would be a very incorrect idea and must be corrected. Finally, Deputy Minister Zhang specifically pointed out that the quality of cotton should be graded and evaluated when purchasing cotton, and the policy of paying higher prices for high-quality cotton should be implemented to encourage farmers to grow high-quality cotton. However, we must prevent two deviations: using American cotton standards to measure Chinese cotton too highly, and irresponsibly collecting cotton indiscriminately. Subsequently, Xi Fengzhou, Deputy Director of the Cotton Improvement Office, gave a summary of the meeting, saying: Through this meeting, everyone has a clear understanding of the importance of seed cotton quality preservation and the importance of relying on the masses and organizing the masses to do this work well. Many valuable experiences were exchanged, especially the review of the undesirable practices of being detached from the masses in the past. In addition, the cotton production overview of various places was introduced through everyone's reports, which is of great help for arranging this year's seed cotton quality preservation work and promoting improved varieties next year. According to incomplete statistics, North China has a total of 12,976,000 mu of cotton fields this year. After deducting losses from wind, hail, water, and drought disasters, it is preliminarily estimated that a total of 838.9 million jin of seed cotton can be produced. The average yield in the region is about 60% to 70%.

Deputy Director Xi continued to clearly point out: Our main task this year is to recover improved seeds for large-scale promotion next year. According to reports, some areas have already experienced mixing of the Si Zi (斯字) cotton 2B variety, which deserves our close attention. According to statistics from 36 counties including Zhengding and Huolu, the planting area of improved varieties in the improved variety management area is 282,724 mu. After deducting disaster losses, there are still 200,8947 mu, which can produce 16,643,300 jin of seed cotton, and 11,134,400 jin can be controlled, yielding 5,703,300 jin of seeds. However, because the improved varieties in Tangshan and Baxian are of lower quality, the actual yield is estimated to be about 4 million jin of improved seeds.

Finally, when talking about the organizational leadership, factory management, and working methods of the seed cotton quality preservation work, Deputy Director Xi emphasized: We should expand publicity to make the masses and cadres aware of the importance of maintaining pure varieties, and we must enable the masses to master the technology to achieve separate harvesting, separate placement, separate pressing, and separate storage.

　　华北棉产改进处
  　收花保纯会议闭幕
    坚决执行良棉优价政策
  　充分保证工业原料供给
    【本报讯】华北人民政府农业部棉产改进处召开的全区收花保纯会议，经过七日的报告讨论，已于昨（九）日圆满闭幕。闭幕会上，农业部张冲副部长首先讲话，他说：在国民党反动卖国政府的统治下，不但工业品依赖美国，就是纺织工业的原料也大部依赖美棉，这种殖民地化的作风到了什么程度是不难想象的。我们要将农业的中国变成工业的中国，便必须解决棉花问题。我们设立了棉产改进处和轧花厂，大量推广优良棉种，一方面可以使农民得到很大的经济利益，同时也就能保证充分供给纺织工业的原料。关于此次会议的目的，他明确指出：收花的目的就是为了保纯。若把轧花厂当成一个营利机关，企图压低棉价，剥削棉农，便是一种极不正确的思想，必须予以纠正。最后张副部长特别指出，在收花时对棉花的质量应作好分级鉴定，执行良棉优价的政策，以鼓励农民种植良棉。但必须防止过高地用美国棉的标准来衡量中国棉花和不负责任随便乱收的两种偏向。继由棉产改进处席凤洲副处长作会议总结，他说：经过这次会议，大家对收花保纯的重要性和依靠群众、组织群众才能作好这一工作有了明确的认识，交流了许多宝贵经验，特别是检讨了过去工作中存在的脱离群众的不良作法，并且通过大家的报告介绍了各地的棉产概况，对于布置今年的收花保纯工作和明年推广优良品种都有很大帮助。根据不完全的统计，华北今年共有棉田一千二百九十七万六千亩，除风、雹、水、旱灾害损失外，初步估计共可产籽棉八万万三千八百九十万斤。全区平均产量约为六到七成。
    席副处长继明确指出：我们今年的工作任务主要在收回优良种籽，以便明年大量推广。根据报告，有些地区的斯字棉二Ｂ已有混杂的现象发生，值得我们严密注意。良种管理区的良种播种面积，据正定、获鹿等三十六县统计共二十八万二千七百二十四亩，除灾害损失外，尚存二十万零八千九百四十七亩，能产籽棉一千六百六十四万三千斤，而能控制的则为一千一百一十三万四千四百斤，可得种籽五百七十万三千三百斤，但因唐山、霸县的良种较次，实际约可收成四百万斤优良种籽。
    最后席副处长在说到收花保纯工作的组织领导、工厂管理、工作方法等问题时，强调提出：我们应扩大宣传，使群众和干部都认识到保持纯种的重要性，并要使群众掌握技术，做到分收、分放、分压和分藏。
