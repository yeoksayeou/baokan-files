　　"A Land Without News" – Chongqing
    Zhu Ping
    --Southwest Correspondence--
    In general, shops in various parts of the Southwest are deserted, with hardly anyone visiting them. The restaurant business is also very sluggish. People use any money they have to buy rice and store it away, but even storing rice is a luxury because most people are short of money, regardless of how worthless the gold and silver certificates are. With people's lives like this, who has money to buy books and newspapers?!
    Bookstores sometimes don't make a single sale in half a month. Discounting prices doesn't attract customers. When the food bills are almost due, they have no choice but to write off the debt. No books are being printed by any printing houses in Chongqing. Chongqing originally had more than two hundred printing factories, but now only about thirty are undertaking printing jobs, and even these thirty-odd are working part-time. Only three printing factories can be said to be working fully: the South China Printing Factory, the Hongzhang Color Printing Factory, and the government-run "Central" Printing Factory in Chongqing. What are they printing? The Central Bank's "fixed amount promissory notes" and "silver yuan fractional currency notes." In short, the printing industry has completely gone bankrupt.
    Shoddy magazines have disappeared, and quality publications, of course, can't be produced. If you don't even have food to eat, what magazines are you going to read?
    Newspapers are certainly something everyone needs to read, but not many people can afford to subscribe. Therefore, most people have to read wall newspapers because they have become concerned about national affairs. In the past, government organizations would subscribe to several copies of newspapers, but now things are different. Taking Chongqing Women's Middle School as an example, they used to subscribe to four newspapers, but now they can't afford even one (because they have no funds). Chongqing has 1.2 million citizens and a total of eight broadsheet newspapers and five tabloid newspapers, but the total number of newspapers sold is less than 30,000 (including foreign sales), which is four-fifths less than the approximately 140,000 copies of the New China Daily in the 34th year of the Republic [1945].
    The content of the newspapers is completely dominated by the Kuomintang reactionaries. In June of this year, Luo Cairong, the chairman of the reactionary Kuomintang Chongqing Municipal Party Department, wanted a certain newspaper to publish an anti-Soviet article. The newspaper did not indicate whether it would publish it or not. Luo then slammed the table and said, "If you don't publish it, you'll be shut down tomorrow." As a result, all the newspapers were forced to publish such stinking articles.
    Of course, readers are not interested in these stinking articles and distorted news, so each newspaper finds its own way: either clipping Hong Kong newspaper foreign dispatches, or adopting a "big gun" policy, or adopting yellow journalism tactics. In these methods, clipping Hong Kong newspaper foreign dispatches is generally the most popular. The reason for adopting this method is that since the People's Liberation Army crossed the Yangtze River, the reactionary "Central News Agency" has had very few dispatches, and the newspapers can hardly fill the pages with it. The "World Daily" adopted the "big gun policy" (this was its desperate attempt to survive). It is well known that the World Daily is a CC [Clique] newspaper. The content is reactionary and erroneous, and the citizens do not buy it. So it came up with this trick. In June, it had an editorial "Questioning Zhang Yuejun" (in fact, this was just a small internal friction between the CC Clique and the Political Science Clique), plus some small news broadcast by Xinhua Radio. Surprisingly, it worked, increasing the newspaper's circulation from 1,000 to more than 4,000 copies. This shows how eager the people are to know the news from the liberated areas! The newspaper was eventually closed down on July 25 by Zhang Qun, the head of the Political Science Clique, because the contradictions between the CC Clique and the Political Science Clique could not be overcome. Most of the more progressive editorial staff of the Chongqing Ta Kung Pao were suppressed, some fled, some were arrested, and a batch of loyal news practitioners were replaced. The Chengdu and Chongqing editions of the "Xinmin Daily" were also attacked by thugs on July 20. This was another "masterpiece" after the demon kings Wang Lingji and Yang Sen used force to resolve Liu Wenhui's "Western Daily." The "National Public News," which sells economic news, is still attached to Zhang Qun's banner and survives.
    After repeated devastation of Chongqing's news industry, what remains are only some extremely reactionary and yellow newspapers. It is impossible to see real news in these newspapers. Therefore, Chongqing has become a land without news.

　　“没有新闻的天地”——重庆
    祝平
    ——西南通讯——
    西南各地一般的商店门可罗雀，根本没有多少人去照顾。饭馆的生意也是非常冷落。人们有点钱便买点米存起来，但存米也只是奢望，因为一般人是缺钱的，别看金券银券不值钱。人民生活如此，对于书报，谁还有钱去买呢？！
    书店成半月还不能成交一次，减价折扣都召不来顾客，等到吃的帐款差不多时，只得倒帐了事。重庆全市印刷所没一本书承印。重庆本来有印刷厂二百多家，现在办承印的不过三十几家，而且这三十几家的工作时间也是部分的。说得上充分工作的只有三家印刷厂，一个是华南印刷厂，一个是鸿章彩印厂，还有官办的“中央”印制厂重庆厂。它们印的什么呢？中央银行的“定额本票”“银元辅币券”。总而言之，印刷业已整个破产。
    杂志不象样的也已绝迹，成材的刊物当然出不来。饭都没的吃，看什么杂志呢？
    报纸当然是大家需要看的，但是订得起报纸的人，并不太多，因此多半都要看墙报，因为他们已变得关心国事了。过去机关上都是订好几份报，现在可不同了，以重庆市女中作例，过去订四份报纸，现在一份也订不起了（因为没有经费）。重庆市有一百二十万市民，共有八家对开报纸，五家四开报，但销报总数不及三万份（内中还有外销），比三十四年度新华日报约十四万份还要少五分之四。
    报纸的内容完全被国民党反动派所支配，在今年六月，有一次反动派国民党重庆市党部主委罗才荣要某一家报纸登一篇反苏文章，这一家报纸没有表示可否，罗当时便击桌表示：“如果不登，明天停刊”。于是各报也就被迫刊载了这样的臭文。
    仅凭这些臭文和歪曲事实的消息，当然引不起读者的兴趣，于是各报分别自找门路：或者剪港报外电，或者采取大炮政策，或者采取黄色办法。在这几种办法中，一般来说以剪港报外电讯最流行。采取这种办法的原因，是因为反动“中央社”自从解放军渡江后，电讯稿奇少，各报凭它几乎不能填版面。采取“大炮政策”的是“世界日报”（这是他的死里求生之策）。世界日报是ＣＣ的报，这是尽人皆知的，内容反动谬误，市民都不买它，于是特来这一手，六月里曾有一篇社论“质张岳军”（其实这不过是ＣＣ和政学系的内部小摩擦），再加上登一些新华电台广播的小消息。说起来也真见效，就这样使那张报纸由一千份增加到四千多份。可见人民是多么渴望知道解放区的消息啊！那张报纸终由于ＣＣ和政学系间的矛盾不能克服，在七月二十五日被政学系的头子张群封闭了。重庆大公报比较进步的编采人员大多受到压迫，吓跑的吓跑，逮捕的逮捕，另换上一批御用的新闻从业员。“新民报”的成都重庆两版，也同时在七月二十日被暴徒袭击。这是魔王王陵基、杨森武力解决刘文辉“西方日报”后的又一次“杰作”。卖经济消息的“国民公报”，仍附在张群麾下残存着。
    重庆新闻事业在一再摧残之后，留下来的只有一些极反动的和黄色报纸了。在这些报纸上是看不到真实的新闻的，因此，重庆已变成没有新闻的天地了
    四九·八·三○
