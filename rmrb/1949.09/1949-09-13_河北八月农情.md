    Hebei August Agricultural Situation
    In August, the agricultural situation in Hebei, in disaster areas, mainly involved repairing dikes, rushing to deal with risks, draining water to reclaim land, protecting seedlings, and engaging in production for disaster relief, as well as rushing to plant late crops. In non-disaster areas, summer weeding was about to end, and preparations for the autumn harvest were underway. Throughout the province, except for a small number of severely affected areas, efforts were being made to accumulate fertilizer and prepare for wheat planting. At the beginning of August, farmers in non-disaster areas began to conclude summer weeding and launched a fertilizer accumulation campaign, achieving considerable results. All areas paid attention to mobilizing women and semi-able-bodied laborers to weed late seedlings. Generally, spring seedlings had been weeded three or four times, with some weeded seven or eight times. In five counties, including Leting and Changli, 210,000 women participated in summer weeding, estimated to be 92% of the female labor force. Since July, continuous rain and rising river levels prompted farmers near rivers to participate fully in repairing dikes and addressing risks. The rainfall this autumn was unprecedented. Despite great efforts to plug breaches, rivers still overflowed, causing 134 breaches, resulting in disasters affecting 79 counties, over 27 million mu of land, and over 7 million people in the province. The affected population and land area accounted for about one-quarter of the provincial total. The Tianjin, Cangxian, and Tangshan regions were the most severely affected. Since the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the provincial government promptly issued calls and instructions for production and disaster relief, Party, government, military, civilian organizations, and groups at all levels quickly responded to the call from higher authorities. They led the broad masses in carrying out production and disaster relief work, dispatched a large number of cadres to the countryside to help farmers repair dikes, address risks, plug breaches, drain water, resettle disaster victims, and develop sideline production. As of now, the savings and donation movement, from 17 units at the provincial committee level alone, has resulted in donations of over 60,000 jin of rice, over 540,000 yuan, and various other items. State-owned and public enterprises and supply and marketing cooperatives organized transportation to allocate food and seeds to disaster areas and promote the sale of sideline products from disaster areas. In addition, insect pests such as armyworms and locust nymphs were quite severe this month, affecting 72 counties, especially in the central region. After the discovery of insect pests, governments at all levels first publicized and mobilized the masses to eliminate superstition and the idea of "sweeping only the snow from one's own doorstep." At the same time, they vigorously organized the masses to carry out large-scale capture and beating, village by village, neighborhood by neighborhood, day and night, without stopping in wind or rain, to overcome insect pests and protect autumn fields. Apart from the aforementioned disaster areas, a bumper harvest is expected for autumn crops in the vast non-disaster areas of the province. In the south, such as in Xiajin, Nangong, Wei County, and Cixian, early rice stalks are four feet tall, and the ears are large and thick, averaging 300 jin per mu. Even those slightly affected by insect pests can yield over 200 jin per mu. Cotton plants generally have long branches and dense bolls, estimated to yield 150 jin of seed cotton per mu. In the central region, such as in Anguo, Wangdu, Dingxian, Qingyuan, Wanxian, Laishui, and Xingtang, autumn crops are lush and beautiful, unprecedented in the past decade. In the northern areas from Changli to Tang County, sorghum and black beans in waterlogged areas still have the potential for harvest. According to estimates from eight regions in central and southern Hebei, cotton production this year could reach over 570 million jin of seed cotton. To shorten the spring famine next year, disaster areas are vigorously draining water to free up land, and non-disaster areas are mostly accumulating fertilizer and preparing seeds for wheat planting. Economic departments are using specific measures such as allocating funds, providing seed loans, allocating livestock, and supplying fertilizer to solve farmers' difficulties in planting wheat. Some areas have begun leveling fields in preparation for harvesting.

    Hebei Julu Eliminates Armyworms and Protects Over 80,000 Mu of Crops
  　Farmers are Smiling and Preparing to Thresh New Grain
    [Report from this newspaper] Under the leadership of the Party and the government, farmers in Julu County promptly captured and beat armyworms, allowing over 80,000 mu of grain about to be harvested to be saved. Armyworms began to appear in the fourth district of the county on August 2nd. After receiving the report, the county government convened an emergency cadre meeting and organized the masses to capture and beat them, proposing the slogan "Eradicate them where they are found." Armyworms were found in 176 villages throughout the county, and they were quickly eliminated, protecting the soon-to-be-harvested crops. The masses are smiling and preparing the threshing grounds to welcome the upcoming new grain.

    河北八月农情
    八月份河北农情，在灾区主要是修堤抢险，缩水脱地护苗生产救灾，赶种晚田；在非灾区则夏锄将要结束，准备秋收；全省除小部重灾区外，均在积肥，准备种麦。八月初，非灾区各地农民，即开始结束夏锄，展开积肥运动，并已获得不少成绩。各地均注意发动妇女及半劳动力参加锄晚苗，一般春苗都已锄过三、四遍，有的锄过七、八遍。乐亭、昌黎等五县，参加夏锄的妇女达二十一万人，估妇女劳动力的百分之九十二。七月以来，阴雨连绵，各河水势猛涨，沿河附近村庄，农民全力参加修堤抢险。本年秋季雨量之大，为往年所未有，虽经大力抢堵决口，但各河仍发生漫溢现象，并决口一三四处，致使全省七十九号、二千七百余万亩土地、七百余万人民遭受灾难，受灾人口及地亩约达全省总数的四分之一上下。其中以天津、沧县、唐山等三个专区受灾最重。自中共河北省委和省府及时发出生产救灾号召和指示后，各地党、政、军、民机关团体迅即响应上级号召，领导广大群众进行生产救灾工作，并抽调大批干部下乡，帮助农民修堤抢险堵口缩水，安置灾民，开展副业生产。各地节约捐献运动，截至现在为止，仅省委级十七个单位，即捐米六万余斤，款五十四万余元及各种物品多件。国公营企业与供销社组织运输，向灾区调剂食粮、种籽，推销灾区副业产品。另外本月各地粘虫、蝗蝻等虫害亦相当严重，虫害范围遍及七十二县，尤以中部为最。发现虫害后，各级政府均先后一面宣传动员，扫除迷信和各扫门前雪的思想；一面大力组织群众以村带村邻帮邻的办法，昼夜不停，风雨不止地进行大规模的捕打，战胜虫害保护了秋田。除上述部分灾区外，全省广大非灾区秋禾可望丰收。南部的夏津、南宫、威县、磁县等地，早谷秆高四尺，穗大粗圆，每亩平均能收三百斤，受过轻微虫害的每亩亦能收二百斤以上。棉花一般的都枝长桃密，估计每亩能摘籽棉一百五十斤。中部的安国、望都、定县、清苑和完县、涞水、行唐等地，秋禾肥美为十年来所未有。北部自昌黎到唐县水淹区的高粱、黑豆，尚可望收。中南部的棉花，据八个专区的估计，今年能产籽棉五亿七千余万斤。为缩短明年春荒，灾区大力泄水腾地，非灾区大部积肥、备种，准备种麦。各经济部门，以拨款、贷种、调剂牲畜、供应肥料等具体办法，解决农民种麦困难。有些地区已开始平场，准备收割。
    河北巨鹿消灭粘虫保住八万余亩庄稼
