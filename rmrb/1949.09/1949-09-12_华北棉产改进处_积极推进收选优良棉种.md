　　North China Cotton Production Improvement Office
　　Actively Promotes the Collection and Selection of Superior Cotton Seeds
　　[Our Newspaper] In order to improve the purity of cotton and maintain superior varieties, so as to lay a good foundation for expanding promotion next year, the North China Cotton Production Improvement Office has decided to combine the selection and separation work in this year's breeding area and promotion area with the general cotton seed selection movement in the county, taking counties with good variety breeding and promotion as units. The work cadres stationed in the counties by the Cotton Production Improvement Office and the professionals sent to the counties by the Ministry of Agriculture will serve as the basic technical backbone, mobilizing the organizational forces of good seed villages to provide technical guidance to good seed households, explaining in detail the significance, methods, and important role of maintaining the purity of good seeds, so that each good seed household will spontaneously and strictly implement the work of selecting and separating good seeds. According to the plant morphology, height, maturity, strength, etc. of the cotton, carefully identify the mixed varieties of cotton and the degraded and inferior cotton that should be eliminated, tie grass ropes at the top as markers, and when picking the cotton, separately harvest the pre-frost flowers of the unmarked cotton plants to maintain the good varieties. The marked mixed and inferior cotton should be strictly separated and collected separately and not kept for seed use. The superior cotton seeds selected and separated by each good seed household must be fully exposed to the sun and then properly stored separately, avoiding loss and mixing as much as possible, so as to be centrally controlled and utilized in a planned manner. All farmers who have planted good varieties this year are urged to keep their own seeds, emphasizing that no seeds will be issued next year. Those who may plant more next year should keep more seeds, but each mu (unit of area) should keep only fifteen jin (unit of weight) of superior cotton seeds for their own use, without keeping too much to avoid waste or arbitrarily distributing them to other families. In addition to these self-retained seeds, the superior cotton flowers selected and separated by each household will be centrally purchased and processed by the Cotton Production Improvement Office in conjunction with local flower collection agencies and ginneries to control superior cotton seeds for expanded breeding and promotion next year.

　　华北棉产改进处
　  积极推进收选优良棉种
    【本报讯】华北棉产改进处为提高棉花纯度，保持优种，以求打下明年扩大推广的良好基础，对于本年良种繁殖区推广区的选良分收工作，决定以有良种繁殖推广的县为单位，结合全县普遍性的棉花选种运动。由棉产改进处指导区驻县的工作干部和农业部派到县的专业人员为基本技术骨干，动员良种村的各种组织力量，对良种户普遍进行技术指导，详细解释良种保纯的意义方法及其重要作用，使每一良种户自发的去严格实行选良分收的工作。根据棉花的株式形态高矮，成熟迟早，生长强弱等，细心的将混杂进去的不同品种的棉花和退化变劣的应该淘汰的棉花识别出来，在其顶端结草绳作为标记，收花的时候，将没有标记的棉株的霜前花，单独分收，保持良种，那些有标记的杂劣棉花，则严密分开另收，不要留作种用。各良种户选良分收的优种籽棉，经过充分曝晒后，必须妥为分储，尽量避免散失和混杂，以便有计划的集中掌握利用。凡本年已种植良种的农户，一律号召其自留种，强调明年不再发种，明年可能多种的就多留种，但每亩以自留十五斤优种籽棉为度，不要多留浪费，或任意分散给别家。除此自留种以外，各户选良分收的优种棉花，由棉产改进处结合各地收花机构和轧花厂集中收购加工，掌握优种棉籽，以备下年扩大繁殖推广之用。　（许警众）
