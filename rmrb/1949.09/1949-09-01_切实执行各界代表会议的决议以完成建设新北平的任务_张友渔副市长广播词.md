Broadcast by Vice Mayor Zhang Youyu of the Beiping Municipal People's Government on the Beiping People's Broadcasting Station on August 29, entitled "Conscientiously Implement the Resolutions of the Representatives' Conference to Complete the Task of Building a New Beiping," the full text is as follows: Fellow compatriots of Beiping:

　　The resolutions of the Beiping Municipal Representatives' Conference have been conveyed to you all by the representatives who attended the meeting, so there is no need for me to say more. What I want to say is how the Beiping Municipal People's Government will implement these resolutions. On the day the Representatives' Conference closed, I, on behalf of the Municipal Government, clearly stated to the conference: We sincerely accept the resolutions of the conference, and we are willing to do our best and as quickly as possible to implement all other resolutions, within the limits of available manpower and financial resources, in addition to what has already been done and is being done. Now, I would like to reaffirm to you all: The Municipal Government will conscientiously implement the resolutions of the Representatives' Conference to complete the task of building a new Beiping.

　　In fact, the Municipal Government has repeatedly convened government affairs meetings to conduct thorough and detailed discussions on how to implement the resolutions of the Representatives' Conference, formulate practical and feasible specific plans based on the actual situation, considering priorities, and some have already been put into effect.

　　The resolution of the Representatives' Conference requires us to continue to suppress the activities of all counter-revolutionary elements and eliminate bandits, special agents, and all remnants of the reactionaries. We accept this requirement and have resolutely implemented it. In addition to continuing to seriously register members of reactionary parties and groups, the Public Security Bureau has arrested a batch of those who refuse to register and continue their activities. Those who were coerced will not be held accountable, and those who repent and rehabilitate themselves will still be treated with leniency, but those who are principal culprits, who have committed heinous crimes, or who continue to do evil will be severely suppressed and punished. The Public Security Bureau has obtained sufficient evidence of all their past and present activities. If they do not quickly bow their heads to the people, confess their crimes to the people, repent, and make amends, we will never forgive them. Forgiving them would be cruel to the people.

　　The resolution of the Representatives' Conference requires us to severely punish profiteers and stabilize prices. We accept this requirement and have taken necessary measures. It is common knowledge that one of the main reasons for the price fluctuations in July was the disruption caused by profiteers. We did not punish them in time, causing the people to suffer some losses. Now we have decided to strengthen market management on the one hand, crack down on profiteer speculation, starting with the rectification of the grain and cloth markets, establish grain and yarn exchanges, and strengthen inspection work at the same time; on the other hand, those profiteers who have been found to have hoarded goods for speculation, manipulated prices, and disrupted financial prices will be given appropriate punishment according to the severity of their circumstances. If we allow profiteers to operate freely, it will be harmful not only to the general public, but also to legitimate industrialists and merchants.

　　Regarding the restoration and development of production, the Representatives' Conference resolutions provided many valuable opinions. The most important point is that to restore and develop production, in addition to the necessary and sufficient capital and raw materials, the first requirement is to open up sales channels, and high costs, poor quality, unplanned production, and product specifications that do not meet market needs are major obstacles to opening up sales channels. To remove these obstacles, we have decided to set up a Production Guidance Committee and a Trade Guidance Committee within the Financial and Economic Committee. At the same time, the state-owned enterprises led by the enterprise have launched a campaign to reduce costs and improve quality. The former adopted methods such as adjusting personnel, streamlining institutions, saving raw materials, and establishing systems. The latter is being developed by each unit according to different circumstances. In addition, for private enterprises, in addition to continuing to provide assistance in terms of loans, orders, opening up markets, and supplying raw materials, the Labor Bureau will also take the initiative and actively adjust labor-management relations in accordance with the principle of mutual benefit for labor and management and the development of production, and systematically conclude collective contracts, expecting to complete the conclusion of collective contracts in various industries within one year. For unemployed workers, the Labor Bureau is actively finding ways out for them, and has negotiated with the Northeast, and can now introduce 2,000 people to the Northeast; next spring, it can introduce more people.

　　Regarding the development of the people's cultural and educational undertakings, the resolution of the Representatives' Conference requires us to solve the problem of schooling for workers' children and the problem of adult literacy education. The Education Bureau is actively solving these two problems. First, before the closing of the Representatives' Conference, the first enrollment of municipal primary schools had already enrolled 4,342 children of workers. Later, we added 39 classes in various schools and enrolled 1,340 children of workers. In addition, each school can also enroll about 1,000 students. Now the Education Bureau and the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions are consulting on a second plan to increase classes. The previous enrollment of municipal middle schools had already enrolled 402 children of workers. Now we have decided to add 12 to 14 classes in each school, specifically for workers' children, which can accommodate about 700 to 900 people. In addition, the private middle schools that have been taken over and reorganized by the government, Xinsheng and Dazhong, can also squeeze out four or five classes specifically for workers' children. Also, Changxindian Wanxiao Bingzhuan has specially added three middle school classes for workers' children. Second, adult literacy education has decided to be convened by the Education Bureau of the College and University Education Federation, the Primary and Secondary School Education Federation, the Student Federation, and various schools, institutions, and groups to discuss ways to expand the implementation. Now Girls' No. 1 Middle School and other schools have begun to run adult literacy classes, and other schools are also preparing to run them. It is estimated that only the adult literacy classes run by public and private middle schools can accommodate 3,000 to 5,000 students.

　　In terms of municipal construction, the Construction Bureau has formulated a specific plan for implementing the resolutions of the Representatives' Conference, considering priorities. The first things to do are: 1. In the three months of August, September, and October, repair Guang'anmen Avenue, Chaoyangmen Avenue, Xuanwai Avenue, and Dongzhushikou to Sanlihe four roads; 2. Formulate a plan for regulating the source river channel, and now the investigation and measurement work has begun, hoping to achieve both irrigation of the western suburbs of paddy fields and supply the needs of the three seas; 3. From September, conduct a general survey of the city's sewers, formulate a regulation plan, and focus on excavating several dark ditches in Xuanwai Avenue and other places; 4. In the three months of August, September, and October, complete the repair and blockage of the city's moat and city wall caves, and the work has now begun; 5. The square in front of Tiananmen Square will be completed in September; 6. Jianguomen will be opened in October; 7. Repairing scenic spots and historical sites is under investigation and design.

　　In terms of health facilities, the Health Bureau has taken the following measures based on the resolutions of the Representatives' Conference: 1. In addition to the municipal hospitals and clinics continuing to maintain the original free treatment system, an additional free mobile medical vehicle will be added to provide free treatment for farmers in the western and northern suburbs; 2. Consult with the Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative to establish a suburban medical cooperative by adopting the method of public-private partnership; 3. To facilitate workers to see a doctor, in addition to the major enterprises should set up their own hospitals or clinics with the necessary assistance from the Health Bureau, the Health Bureau has also drafted a plan to adjust and expand the city's hospitals and health offices, which will be implemented soon. In addition, it also plans to consult with the industrial and commercial circles and the Federation of Trade Unions to jointly set up workers' hospitals or clinics.

　　The resolution of the Representatives' Conference particularly emphasized the dispersal of the population. This is really necessary in today's Beiping. Everyone thinks about it, rather than being unemployed, having no work, and having no livelihood security, staying in Beiping and starving, it is better to go to the countryside to participate in production or serve cultural and educational undertakings. We hope that fleeing landlords, unemployed people, and unemployed intellectuals will resolutely go to the countryside and no longer be attached to Beiping. At the same time, in order to implement the resolution on dispersing the population, we have established a committee to carry out this work in a planned, step-by-step, and efficient manner.

　　The resolution of the Representatives' Conference also particularly emphasized the thorough handling of beggars. Indeed, beggars have recently appeared on the streets again. In addition to the refugees who have fled from the counties that have suffered from floods, who should be dealt with separately, the remaining professional beggars have been sent to relief homes and other places by the district offices and public security bureau police stations for shelter. As of August 26, a total of 327 people have been sheltered. These sheltered beggars, like those who were sheltered before, are old and weak and stay in relief homes and other places to engage in appropriate production, while strong men are sent to Chahar in teams to reclaim wasteland.

　　Practicing strict economy and saving is also one of the important resolutions of the Representatives' Conference, and we have decided to resolutely implement it to the end. First of all, streamline our establishment, economize our expenses, do not use a useless person, do not spend a useless penny, and improve work efficiency, implement the inspection system, use fewer people, spend less money, and do more things, and collect more results.

　　The above is only to explain our implementation plans, arrangements, and situations for the more important resolutions of the Representatives' Conference; in addition, we will also conscientiously implement all the resolutions of the Representatives' Conference.

　　Fellow compatriots of Beiping! We are determined to conscientiously implement the resolutions of the Representatives' Conference to complete the task of building a new Beiping. However, our strength is ultimately limited, and without the cooperation and assistance of the people, it is impossible to smoothly complete this serious task. Therefore, I sincerely hope that you will, on the one hand, supervise and inspect our work, and on the other hand, give support and assistance.

　　切实执行各界代表会议的决议以完成建设新北平的任务
  　张友渔副市长广播词
    北平市人民政府张友渔副市长八月二十九日在北平人民广播电台广播，题目是“切实执行各界代表会议的决议以完成建设新北平的任务”，全文如下：北平市各界同胞们：
    北平市各界代表会议的一切决议，想出席会议的各界代表都已向您们大家做了传达，不需要我再来多说。我所要说的，只是北平市人民政府将怎样执行这些决议。我在各界代表会议闭幕的那一天，曾经代表市政府向大会明确表示：诚恳接受大会的决议，除已经做和正在做的以外，其他一切决议，在人力、财力可能的条件下，也都愿尽量尽速的去做。现在，我愿再度向您们大家负责表示：市政府一定切实执行各界代表会议的决议，以完成建设新北平的任务。
    事实上，市政府已迭次召开政务会议，对怎样执行各界代表会议的决议做了切实周详的讨论，根据实际情况，斟酌缓急先后，分别拟订了切实可行的具体计划，并已有一部分付诸实施。
    各界代表会议决议要求我们继续镇压一切反革命分子的活动，肃清匪特和一切反动派的残余势力。我们接受这一要求，并已坚决执行。公安局除继续认真进行反动党团分子登记外，并把拒绝登记和继续活动者逮捕了一批。对于胁从分子应该不究，对于悔过自新的分子仍将宽大，但对于首要分子、罪大恶极分子或继续为恶的分子，则将严厉镇压和制裁。公安局关于他们过去和现在的一切活动，已经掌握了充分材料，如果他们还不赶快向人民低头、向人民请罪、改过自新、将功折罪，我们决不能宽恕他们。对于他们的宽恕，就是对于人民的残酷。
    各界代表会议决议要求我们严惩奸商、稳定物价。我们接受这一要求，并已采取了必要措施。人所共知，七月份物价波动的主要原因之一是奸商捣乱，我们没有及时惩处他们，致使人民多受一些损害。现在我们决定一方面加强市场管理，取缔奸商投机，先从整顿粮布市场着手，成立粮食和纱布交易所，同时加强检查工作；他方面，对已经查实确曾囤积居奇、投机倒把、扰乱金融物价的奸商，则依据情节轻重，予以适当惩处。如果我们对于奸商任其自由活动，则不仅对于一般人民，而且对于正当工商业者也是有害的。
    关于恢复和发展生产，各界代表会议决议曾提供了不少宝贵的意见。最主要的是指出要恢复和发展生产，除了必须有必要的、足够的资本和原料外，首先就需要打开销路，而成本过高、质量不好、生产无计划、产品规格不合市场需要，则为打开销路的重大障碍。为了扫除这些障碍，我们决定在财经委员会内，设置生产指导委员会和贸易指导委员会。同时，企业同所领导的公营企业已开展了减低成本、提高质量的运动。前者采取了调整人事、裁并机构、节省原料、建立制度等办法。后者正由各单位根据不同情况拟具具体办法。此外对于私营企业，除继续在贷款上、定货上、开辟市场上、供给原料上给予帮助外，并由劳动局主动地积极地在劳资两利、发展生产的原则下调整劳资关系，有系统地缔结集体合同，预期在一年内把各行业的集体合同缔结完毕。对于失业工人，劳动局正积极替他们找出路，已经和东北商妥，现在就可以介绍二千人到东北去；明年春天还可以介绍更多的人去。
    关于发展人民的文化教育事业，各界代表会议决议要我们解决工人子弟失学问题和成人补习教育问题。对于这两个问题，教育局已在积极解决。第一、在各界代表会议闭幕前，各市立小学第一次招生本已招收工人子弟四千三百四十二人，其后我们又在各校增开三十九个班，招收工人子弟一千三百四十人，此外，各校还可招收编级生约千人，现在又由教育局和市总工会会商第二次增班计划。市立中学前次招生已收工人子弟四百零二人，现在我们决定在各校增开十二至十四个班，专收工人子弟，约可收七百至九百人；此外经政府接管改组后的私立中学新生和大中，还可挤出四五个班，专收工人子弟。又在长辛店完小丙专为工人子弟附设了中学班三班。第二、成人补习教育决定由教育局召集院校教联、中小学教联、学联及各学校、各机关、各团体，筹商扩大进行办法。现在女一中等校已开始举办成人补习班，其他各校亦在筹办中，预计只公私立中学所办的成人补习班便可收学员三五千人。
    在市政建设方面，已由建设局斟酌缓急先后，拟具执行各界代表会议决议的具体计划。首先要做的，是：一、在八、九、十这三个月内，修筑广安门大街、朝阳门大街、宣外大街和东珠市口到三里河四条马路；二、拟具整理水源河道计划，现已开始调查测量工作，期能做到既可灌溉西郊水田，又能供给三海需要水量；三、自九月起普查全市下水道，拟具整理计划，并有重点地先掏挖宣外大街等处几条暗沟；四、在八九十这三个月内，将城上濠沟和城墙洞修整堵塞完毕，现已开始工作；五、天安门前开辟广场，九月内可完工；六、建国门十月内即可打开；七、修缮名胜古迹，正在调查设计中。
    在卫生设施方面，已由卫生局根据各界代表会议决议，采取了下列措施：一、除各市立医院和诊疗所继续保持原有的免费治疗制度外，并增加免费巡回医疗汽车一辆，到西郊、北郊为农民免费治疗；二、和市供销合作总社筹商，采取民办公助办法，建立郊区医药合作社；三、为了便利工人诊病，除各大企业应自设医院或医务所由卫生局给以必需帮助外，卫生局并已拟就全市医院卫生事务所调整扩充计划，即将实施。此外，又拟会商工商业界和总工会，共同筹设工人医院或诊疗所。
    各界代表会议决议对疏散人口特别强调。在今天的北平，这实在是必要的。大家想一想，与其没有职业，没有工作，没有生活保障，呆在北平挨饿，何如下乡参加生产或服务文化教育事业。我们希望逃亡地主、无业人民以及失业的知识分子毅然决然到乡下去，再不要留恋北平。同时，我们为了执行疏散人口这一决议，已成立了一个委员会，有计划、有步骤、有效率地进行这一工作。
    各界代表会议决议对彻底处理乞丐也曾特别强调。的确，近来又有乞丐在街头出现。除了从遭受水灾各县逃来的难民应另行处理外，其余职业乞丐已由各区公所和公安局派出所继续送往救济院等处收容，截至八月二十六日止，计收容三百二十七人。这些被收容的乞丐，和以前被收容者一样，老弱留在救济院等处从事适当生产，壮丁则编队送往察哈尔开垦。
    厉行精简节约，也是各界代表会议的重要决议之一，我们决定坚决执行，贯澈到底。首先，精简我们的编制，撙节我们的开支，不用一个无用的人，不花一个无用的钱，并且提高工作效率，实行检查制度，用较少的人，花较少的钱，而做较多的事，收较多的效果。
    以上，只是就各界代表会议比较重要的决议，说明我们的执行计划、布置和情况；此外，各界代表会议的一切决议，我们也都将切实执行。
    北平市各界同胞们！切实执行各界代表会议的决议，以完成建设新北平的任务，我们有此决心。但是我们的力量究竟有限，没有人民的合作和帮助，势不可能顺利完成这一严重任务。因此，我十分诚恳地希望您们大家，对于我们的工作，一方面加以督促和检查，他方面，也给予支持和援助。
