　　Hunan in January
    Since Changsha and parts of Hunan Province were peacefully liberated on August 4th, more than a month has passed. During this period, thanks to the concerted efforts of the Chinese Communist Party, the People's Liberation Army, and the broad masses of the people of Hunan, as well as the sincere cooperation of Generals Cheng Qian and Chen Mingren and the uprising troops under their command, the various evil traces left by the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries in Hunan are gradually being eliminated in the liberated areas, and a new people's Hunan is beginning to be born.
    As of now, the liberated areas of Hunan Province include 25 counties: Linxiang, Yueyang, Xiangyin, Pingjiang, Changsha, Liuyang, Xiangtan, Liling, Huarong, Nanxian, Anxiang, Lixian, Linli, Changde, Taoyuan, Yuanjiang, Hanshou, Yiyang, Ningxiang, Xiangxiang, Anhua, Youxian, Chaling, Anren, and Lingxian. Among them, Changsha, Xiangtan, Yiyang, Ningxiang, and Hanshou are six counties that were peacefully liberated. Although the White bandits are piecing together remnants of their forces in an attempt to make a last-ditch struggle in the southern and western parts of Hunan, the day when all of Hunan will be liberated is coming soon under the invincible power of the People's Liberation Army and the broad masses of the people of Hunan.
    For more than a month, under the correct leadership of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Central China Bureau, the Fourth Field Army of the People's Liberation Army, the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and Generals Cheng Qian and Chen Mingren have worked closely together to begin the transformation of government institutions and uprising troops. In mid-August, the Hunan Provisional Provincial Government, established at the beginning of the liberation, was reorganized first, the foundation of the provincial government was expanded, some members of the Chinese Communist Party participated in the work, and the organization was initially adjusted. On August 19th, the Changsha Military Control Commission was officially established, with Xiao Jingguang as director and Wang Shoudao and Chen Mingren as deputy directors, to take over public enterprises and administrative organs. At the same time, the Changsha Municipal People's Government, the People's Court, the People's Bank, and trade companies were established. On August 29th, with the approval of the Chinese People's Revolutionary Military Commission, the organizational structure of the Hunan People's Military and Political Committee, established at the time of liberation, was expanded, with patriotic people from the Chinese Communist Party and other parties as members, and Cheng Qian and Huang Kecheng as the directors and deputy directors respectively. On the same day, the Hunan Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army was established to lead all armed forces and military construction work in Hunan, with Xiao Jingguang as commander, Huang Kecheng as political commissar, Chen Mingren and Han Xianchu as deputy commanders, and Jin Ming and Tang Tianji as deputy political commissars. The Changsha, Yiyang, and Changde military sub-districts were also established. Subsequently, the Hunan Provisional Provincial Government, with the approval of the Central Plains Provisional People's Government, further strengthened its organization and personnel on September 1st, with Chen Mingren still serving as chairman and Yuan Renyuan from the Chinese Communist Party serving as vice chairman. The uprising troops stationed in Changsha, under the enthusiastic welcome and consolation of the citizens, gradually changed their bad habits of oppressing the people in the past and moved closer to the people. Many soldiers requested to be reorganized into people's teams as soon as possible. In late August, the uprising troops began training.
    In terms of production, the state-owned enterprises and factories taken over in Changsha are gradually recovering and initially improving their operations. Workers in the tooling workshop of the antimony products factory decided on five methods to save raw materials and increase production. The China Merchants Bureau reviewed the serious shortcomings of the lack of safety guarantees in passenger transport in the past and decided to correct them, and planned to strengthen freight work and accept criticisms from merchants at any time. Hunan Electric Company is preparing to increase electricity from the past 600,000 kWh per month to 700,000 kWh in September. Private factories are also gradually resuming work. More than 90 of Changsha's important rice milling industries have resumed work. More than 60 of them had already closed down before liberation. The knitting and homespun cloth industries are also gradually resuming work with the assistance of trade companies distributing raw materials at low prices. State-owned trade companies have generally established branches in the liberated counties and cities to regulate the market with a large amount of materials. The Renminbi has occupied the urban markets of Changsha, Changde, and other places, and is gradually circulating to the countryside. In late August, a movement to reject the use of silver dollars arose simultaneously in various places. The military control commissions in Changsha, Changde, and other places, in response to the people's requests, have ordered the prohibition of silver dollar circulation and stipulated that the Renminbi is the only legal currency. The above measures have played a considerable role in stabilizing prices.
    The people of all classes in Hunan Province, especially the workers, peasants, and other working people, actively support the People's Liberation Army and assist the government in construction work. Workers are stepping up production and restoring transportation to support the advance of the army. Hunan Province has restored telegraph, telephone, highway, shipping, and other transportation to areas outside the province. The section of the Yuehan Railway south of Changsha has been connected to the Zhegan Railway and can be reached from Zhuzhou to Liling. The seamen heroically and cleverly preserved a total of more than 15,000 tons of 18 ships from the White bandits' sabotage conspiracy, and all of them resumed sailing within a few days after liberation. Water transportation from Changsha to Hankou and Shanghai has been smooth one after another. More than 300 employees of the Hunan Provincial Highway Bureau's automobile repair plant and automobile maintenance plant assembled more than 40 vehicles that had been dismantled and hidden to prevent the White bandits from moving and destroying them within ten days after liberation. The number of vehicles currently running is doubled compared to before liberation. In order to improve work efficiency, some employees have demonstrated a high degree of creativity. Li Jingzhi, an electrician worker of the Yuehan Railway, in order to solve the problem of the lack of equipment for the dispatching switchboard, transformed the buzzer to replace the dispatching switchboard's call bell equipment, thus ensuring traffic safety. In the takeover and clean-up work, employees actively participated in the work. With the help of the employees, enterprises such as antimony products factories and the China Merchants Bureau found a lot of materials that were missing from the accounts.
    Peasants in various places enthusiastically contributed requisitioned grain. The Changsha area alone borrowed more than 10 million catties by the end of August. Changsha, Pingjiang, Yueyang, Xiangxiang, Liuyang, and other counties have completed about half of the grain lending task. Changsha County was able to complete the grain borrowing task in early September. In order to stabilize social order, the peasants also helped the troops to suppress bandits. Many peasants transmitted information day and night, regardless of the weather. From the beginning of August to August 22, the Changsha area accepted surrender and reorganized more than 4,400 local bandits. In addition, the peasants along the highways also helped the PLA engineers to repair bridges and highways, accelerated the restoration of transportation, and facilitated support for the front lines and passenger and freight transportation.
    Young students enthusiastically carried out propaganda and other work. During the month, they joined the workers in the forefront of the masses in welcoming the PLA, celebrating liberation, comforting the army and supporting the front, and rejecting the use of silver dollars. Many students from schools have organized themselves to enter factories, rural areas, and troops to serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, learn from them, and publicize the New Democracy policy to them. Nearly 10,000 young people in Changsha applied to the Revolutionary University and other schools or training classes to learn revolutionary knowledge and determined to serve the people.
    At present, due to the harassment of bandits and special agents in the rural areas of Hunan, many wandering troops have not been reorganized, and the revolutionary order has not been fully established. The task of raising food and supporting the front and establishing local people's armed forces is extremely heavy and urgent. There are still many difficulties in various tasks. Party, government, and military organs have begun to organize forces to go deep into the rural areas, strengthen the leadership of various tasks, guide the enthusiasm of the masses to participate in practical work in all aspects, organize the strength of the masses of all classes to support the war, overcome current difficulties, and strive to liberate all of Hunan and Southwest China as soon as possible.

　　湖南一月
    自八月四日长沙和湖南部分地区宣告和平解放以后，到现在已经一个多月了。在此期间，由于中国共产党、人民解放军和湖南广大人民的一致努力，和程潜、陈明仁两将军以及他们所统率的起义部队的诚意合作，国民党反动派统治湖南所遗留的种种罪恶痕迹正在已解放的地区逐渐消除，新的人民的湖南已经在开始诞生。
    截至目前为止，湖南省已解放的地区计有临湘、岳阳、湘阴、平江、长沙、浏阳、湘潭、醴陵、华容、南县、安乡、澧县、临澧、常德、桃源、沅江、汉寿、益阳、宁乡、湘乡、安化、攸县、茶陵、安仁、酃县等二十五县，其中长沙、湘潭、益阳、宁乡、汉寿等六县都是和平解放的。现白匪虽拼凑残兵企图在湘南、湘西一带作垂死挣扎，但在无敌的人民解放军和湖南广大人民的强大威力下，湖南的全部解放的日子，是很快就要到来了。
    一个多月以来，在中国共产党中央和华中局的正确领导和湖南各阶层人民的赞助下，人民解放军第四野战军、中共湖南省委会与程潜、陈明仁两将军密切合作，开始着手改造政府机构及起义部队。八月中旬首先改组了在解放之初成立的湖南临时省政府，扩大了省政府的基础，中共部分人员参与了工作，并初步地调整了机构。八月十九日长沙市军事管制委员会正式成立，由萧劲光任主任，王首道、陈明仁任副主任，开始接管公营企业和行政机关。同时并建立了长沙市人民政府、人民法院、人民银行、贸易公司等。八月二十九日，经中国人民革命军事委员会批准扩大在解放时成立的湖南人民军政委员会的组织机构，由中共方面及其他各方面的爱国人士为委员，程潜、黄克诚分任正副主任。同日成立了中国人民解放军湖南军区，领导湖南所有武装部队及建军工作，由萧劲光任司令员，黄克诚任政治委员，陈明仁、韩先楚任副司令员，金明、唐天际任副政治委员。长沙、益阳、常德三军分区亦随之成立。接着湖南临时省政府，经中原临时人民政府批准，于九月一日再度充实机构和人员，陈明仁仍兼主席，中共方面袁任远出任副主席。驻在长沙的起义部队，在市民的热烈欢迎与慰劳之下，也逐渐改变了过去压迫人民的坏作风，向人民靠拢，许多士兵都要求早日整编为人民队伍。八月下旬，起义部队开始整训。
    在生产事业方面，长沙市已经接管的公营企业工厂正逐渐恢复，并初步改进业务。锑品制造厂车工间的工友们决定了五项节省原料，增加生产的办法。招商局检讨了以往客运缺乏安全保障的严重缺点，决定加以改正，并拟加强货运工作，随时接受客商批评。湖南电气公司准备在九月份将电力由过去的每月六十万度增加至七十万度。私营各业工厂也逐渐复工。长沙重要工业之一的碾米工业已复工者达九十余家。其中六十余家在解放前已经倒闭。针织、土布等业，也在贸易公司低价配售原料等方式扶助下，渐次复工。国营贸易公司普遍在已解放的各县市建立分支机构，以大量物资调剂市场。人民币已占领长沙、常德等地的城市市场，并逐渐向农村流通。八月下旬在各地同时兴起了拒用银元运动，长沙、常德等地军管会顺应人民要求，已下令禁止银元流通，规定人民币为唯一法定货币。以上措施，对于稳定物价都起了相当作用。
    湖南省各阶层人民，尤其工人、农民和其他劳动人民积极地支援人民解放军，并协助政府进行建设工作。工人们加紧生产，恢复交通，以支援大军前进。湖南省已解放地区对省外的电报、电话、公路、航运等交通均已恢复。粤汉铁路长沙以南一段已与浙赣路接通，可由株州通至醴陵。海员们英勇机智地从白匪破坏阴谋下保全的总数达一万五千余吨的十八艘轮船，在解放后数日内，就全部复航。长沙至汉口及上海等地的水上交通乃先后畅通。湖南省公路局汽车修理总厂和汽车保养厂的三百余职工，在解放后十天以内，即将四十多部为防止白匪迁移破坏而拆散，隐藏的汽车全部按起来，现行驶车辆比解放前增加一倍。为了提高工作效率，有些职工发挥了高度的创造性。粤汉铁路电机工人李敬之，为了解决缺少调度总机的设备，改造了蜂鸣器代替调度总机叫铃的设备，因而保障了行车安全。在接管清理工作中，职工们更积极地参加工作。由于职工们的帮助，锑品制造厂及招商局等企业查出了许多漏在帐外的物资。
    各地农民们踊跃地献出征借粮食，仅长沙专区截至八月底便借了一千万斤以上，长沙、平江、岳阳、湘乡、浏阳等县都已完成了借粮任务的半数左右，长沙县的借粮任务在九月初能大体完成。为安定社会秩序，农民们还帮助部队剿匪。许多农民不分昼夜晴雨，传送情报。长沙专区自八月初至八月二十二日受降及改编的地方股匪达四千四百余人。除此而外，沿着公路两旁的农民们还帮助解放军工兵抢修桥梁、公路，加速了交通的恢复，便利了支援前线和客货运输。
    青年学生们热情地进行宣传工作及其他工作。一个月当中在欢迎解放军，庆祝解放，劳军支前，拒用银元等运动中，都和职工们一道走在人民大众的前列。许多学校的学生曾有组织地进入工厂、农村、部队为工农兵服务，向他们学习，并向他们宣传新民主主义的政策。长沙市有近万的青年投考革命大学及其他学校或训练班等学习革命知识，决心为人民服务。
    目前的湖南农村由于土匪、特务滋扰，许多游杂部队没有整理，革命秩序尚未完全建立，而筹粮支前，建立人民地方武装的任务又极为繁重紧急，在各种工作中还存在着许多困难。党政军机关已开始组织力量，准备深入农村，加强各种工作的领导，把群众的热情引导到参加各方面的实际工作中去，组织各阶层群众的力量来支援战争，克服当前的困难，争取迅速解放全湖南和大西南。
