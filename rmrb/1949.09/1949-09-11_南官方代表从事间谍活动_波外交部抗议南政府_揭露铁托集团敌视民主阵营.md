Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 10th: According to a Warsaw dispatch from the Polish News Agency: The Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs delivered a note to the Yugoslav Embassy in Warsaw on the 9th, stating that Polish public security organs have long determined that some representatives of various official Yugoslav groups sent to Poland are engaged in espionage activities within Poland. The specific facts are as follows: Petrowic Milic, the official representative of the Yugoslav Ministry of Transport, was arrested on August 29, 1949, for espionage. During the search of his apartment in Tsorzov, various secret documents related to some Polish industrial institutions were found, fully proving that Petrowic was engaged in espionage activities in Poland aimed at undermining Poland's economic and defense potential. The investigation of this case is continuing. It must be stated that, according to the orders and interests of certain organs of the Yugoslav government, Petrowic began espionage activities after arriving in Poland in March 1948, organized a spy network, recruited spies within Poland, and ordered them to provide information, documents, drafts, and plans regarding Polish industry and railways. Petrowic specifically attempted to obtain information about the economic relations between Poland and the Soviet Union, Bulgaria, and other countries. Petrowic paid various amounts of money to the spies he recruited and transferred the espionage materials obtained in this way to Yugoslavia.
    In addition to espionage activities, Polish public security organs have also determined that Petrowic, like other official representatives of the Yugoslav government, has been carrying out subversive propaganda in Poland, distributing illegal Yugoslav propaganda printed abroad and banned from sale in Poland, and slandering democratic Poland and its allies—the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries. This criminal propaganda activity attempts to incite hostility towards the People's Democratic camp in Poland and cooperates with criminal fascist underground activities.
    The Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs reserves the right to raise the issue of the Yugoslav government's espionage activities in Poland again. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs now declares that the fact that Petrowic, an official representative of Yugoslavia, is engaged in espionage activities within Poland is a hostile act against the Polish people and the Polish state. In view of these facts, the Government of the Republic of Poland firmly demands that these representatives of Yugoslavia cease these hostile activities within Poland.
    The note pointed out that the Yugoslav government's hostile attitude towards Poland has become increasingly obvious and is manifested in various aspects, such as sabotage of commercial relations and the closure of the Polish News Agency in Belgrade, which are not accidental. This is a manifestation of the Yugoslav government's increasingly obvious subordination to international reactionary forces.
    The Polish people and the Polish government fully recognize that the above facts should not be borne by the Yugoslav people, but absolutely by the current Yugoslav government. This situation, which itself violates the interests of Yugoslavia, has nothing in common with any true democratic spirit, with the loyal tradition of fighting for liberation and freedom, and with the desire of the Yugoslav people for peaceful labor.
    The Polish government, inspired by the most friendly sentiments towards the Yugoslav people, therefore concluded a treaty of friendship and mutual assistance with the Yugoslav government on March 18, 1946. In view of the above facts, the Polish government is obliged to declare that, despite the efforts and feelings of the Yugoslav and Polish people, this treaty has been trampled into nothingness by the Yugoslav government.
    The Polish government is convinced that the Yugoslav government's hostile attitude towards the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries violates the attitude of the Yugoslav people and can never diminish the feelings of the Polish people towards the Yugoslav people. The Yugoslav people will not allow themselves to be driven onto the road of collusion with imperialist warmongers, nor to abandon their independence.

　　南官方代表从事间谍活动
　  波外交部抗议南政府
    揭露铁托集团敌视民主阵营
    【新华社北平十日电】据波兰通讯社华沙讯：波兰外交部九日以照会一件，递交南斯拉夫驻华沙大使馆，照会略称：波兰公安机关很久以来，就确定南斯拉夫派遣来波兰的各官方团体中的某些代表，在波兰境内从事间谍活动。具体事实如下：南斯拉夫交通部的正式代表彼特罗维区·米利区，于一九四九年八月二十九日因间谍罪被逮捕。在搜查他的曹尔左夫公寓中，发现了各种有关波兰一些工业机构的秘密文件，充分证明了彼特罗维区在波兰从事旨在破坏波兰经济和国防潜力的间谍活动。此项案件的调查正继续中。必须声明：按照南斯拉夫政府某些机关的命令和利益，彼特罗维区在一九四八年三月到达波兰后，即开始间谍活动，组织了间谍网，在波兰境内收买间谍，命令他们供给关于波兰工业与铁路等情报、文件、草案和计划。彼特罗维区曾特别企图获得有关波兰与苏联、保加利亚和其他国家间的经济关系的情报。彼特罗维区付给他收买的间谍人员以各种数额的金钱，并把由此种方法所获得的间谍资料，转送往南斯拉夫。
    除了间谍活动之外，波兰公安机关还确定彼特罗维区象南斯拉夫政府的其他官方代表一样，在波兰进行颠覆性的宣传，散发在外国印造的且被禁止在波兰发卖的非法的南斯拉夫宣传品，诽谤民主的波兰及其盟邦——苏联和人民民主国家。这种罪恶的宣传活动，企图在波兰唤起对人民民主阵营的敌视，并与罪恶的法西斯地下活动相配合。
    波兰外交部保留其再度提出关于南斯拉夫政府在波兰的间谍活动问题的权利，外交部现在声明：南斯拉夫官方代表彼特罗维区在波兰境内从事间谍活动这一事实，是一种反对波兰人民和波兰国家的敌对行动。鉴于这些事实，波兰共和国政府坚决要求南斯拉夫的这些代表们停止在波兰境内的这种敌对活动。
    照会指出：南斯拉夫政府对波兰的敌对态度，已越来越明显，而且表现在各方面，例如：对商业关系的怠工，和封闭贝尔格莱德的波兰新闻处，这些都不是偶然的。这是南斯拉夫政府愈来愈明显地隶属于国际反动力量的一种表现。
    波兰人民以及波兰政府完全确认上述事实不应由南斯拉夫人民负责，而绝对要由南斯拉夫现政府负责。这种本身违背南斯拉夫利益的情况，是和任何真正的民主精神，和为解放与自由而斗争的忠诚传统，和南斯拉夫各族人民的和平劳动的愿望，没有任何共同之处的。
    波兰政府为对南斯拉夫各族人民的最友好情谊所鼓舞，因此曾在一九四六年三月十八日和南斯拉夫政府缔结了一个友好、互助条约。波兰政府有鉴于上述事实，乃不得不声明：尽管有南斯拉夫人民和波兰人民的努力奋斗和感情，这个条约已被南斯拉夫政府践踏得化为乌有了。
    波兰政府确信，南斯拉夫政府对苏联和人民民主国家的敌对态度，是违反南斯拉夫人民的态度的，而且绝不能够减少波兰人民对南斯拉夫人民的感情，南斯拉夫人民将不容许自己被赶上和帝国主义战争贩子勾结的道路，被赶上放弃他们的独立的道路。
