　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 17th. The struggle of the Malayan people against British imperialism and for survival continues. According to a Kuala Lumpur dispatch from Reuters, the people's guerrillas are unusually active in the central Malayan and Malaya-Thailand border jungle areas. Since the British colonial authorities declared a state of emergency in Malaya in June of last year, their barbaric massacres and suppressions of the Malayan people have repeatedly failed for more than a year. Recently, they declared a curfew throughout the night in central Malaya. At the same time, they are conspiring to announce a "relaxation" of the emergency decree in an attempt to use appeasement policies to divide the Malayan people's resistance forces. However, this kind of deceptive means cannot improve the British army's predicament in Malaya. Bloody suppression is still actively underway. According to Reuters, since the declaration of the state of emergency, Malayan security forces have massacred a total of 790 people's guerrillas, innocently killing more than 500 civilians, and detaining more than 6,400 people. This year, the number of foreigners deported has reached more than 3,400. In the most recent month, the British authorities transferred 1,500 new police officers to participate in combat and established many new police outposts. Meanwhile, according to Bangkok news, the Thai and Malayan British authorities concluded an agreement on the 7th to strengthen suppression measures against guerrillas in the jungle areas along the two countries' borders.

　　中马来亚游击队活跃英军更困难
    【新华社北平十七日电】马来亚人民反对英帝国主义、争取生存的斗争仍在坚持中。据路透社吉隆坡消息透露，马来亚中部和马来亚与泰国边境丛林地带人民游击队异常活跃。英殖民当局自去年六月在马来亚宣布紧急状态后，一年多来对马来亚人民实施野蛮屠杀和清剿迭告失败，最近在马来亚中部宣布通宵戒严，同时，又阴谋宣布“放宽”紧急法令，以图用怀柔政策分化马来亚人民的抵抗力量。但这种欺骗手段并不能改进英军在马来亚的困境。血腥的清剿仍在积极进行中。据路透社消息透露：自宣布紧急状态以来，马来亚治安部队共屠杀人民游击队七百九十人，无辜杀死老百姓五百余人，被扣押者达六千四百余人。今年被驱逐出境的外侨已达三千四百余人。在最近一个月，英当局调集一千五百名新警察参加作战，并建立许多新警察岗哨。同时，据曼谷消息：泰国和马来亚英当局已于七日缔结协定，加强对两国边境丛林中游击队的清剿措施。
