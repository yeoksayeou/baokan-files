　　The Role of the Dalian Trade Union in the Production Movement
　　One of the Experiences of Trade Union Work in Northeast China
　　The production movement in Dalian's public factories began in 1946. Over the past three years, remarkable achievements and valuable experiences have been gained in the recovery, development and construction of industry, in the management of factories, and in the trade union movement. This article aims to provide a general introduction to these aspects.

　　I. Put Production First
　　At the beginning of Dalian's liberation, a large number of workers were unemployed; those who were employed also lived a hard life, even lower than the standards during the Japanese imperialist occupation. In this situation, should the trade union focus on production or welfare? Initially, there was a great divergence of opinion among trade union cadres. Some argued that "only by improving living conditions can production be improved," and "the trade union in the factory should focus on welfare and education to ensure production." Although some also argued that "workers must first improve production in order to improve their lives; without good production, there is no way to improve lives," the former view prevailed due to a lack of experience. Some trade union comrades engaged in business to improve workers' lives, trying to earn money to support the workers and "improve workers' lives," but after a few months, it collapsed and even the factory closed down. After much exploration, in 1946, a solution was found - launching a production movement. Facts have proven that this is the only correct way to improve workers' lives. Now the lives of Dalian workers are the highest and best in the Northeast, with workers' real wages increasing by 40% compared to just after liberation, while prices have fallen by 46% compared to that time. Various places in Northeast China have accepted this experience. After the liberation of industrial cities, they immediately concentrated their efforts on developing production, solving all problems through production. The old idea that a long period of full preparation is necessary to launch a production movement has been negated by Dalian's practical experience.

　　II. Grasp Production Plans and Use Trade Union Groups to Promote Production
　　Grasping production plans is one of the most important methods for Dalian trade unions to ensure the completion of production tasks. After the administration makes a production plan, the trade union immediately convenes trade union cadres and worker activists to study whether it can be completed, how to complete it, whether it can be exceeded, and by how much. After research by various departments, the trade union's production plan is formulated (this plan is repeatedly discussed by all workers, which increases the workers' enthusiasm and creativity, and is often higher than the production plan formulated by the administration), and then this plan is distributed layer by layer until each group studies and formulates its own production plan. In the life of the trade union group, production is also the center, and the degree of completion of the plan is regularly checked, and the methods for achieving the plan are studied, and many problems in production are thus solved. This kind of group life is much richer and more fulfilling than the previous group life that was divorced from production, empty reviews of "attitude," talking about "political" leadership, and "learning." At the same time, because the trade union has grasped the production plan, it can solve problems in a timely manner when they are discovered, which is a great improvement compared to the past situation of empty slogans guaranteeing production tasks without even knowing the production plan. This avoids the blindness of the trade union in the production movement and truly provides a strong guarantee for the production movement.

　　III. Reward Inventions and Creations, Launch "Rationalization Proposals"
　　There was a period when Dalian used the method of strengthening labor intensity to improve production. While this can make workers more active and responsible, and even process a lot more, it also often leads to another deviation, such as often causing a large number of patients due to competition, and increasing labor intensity has a certain limit, and cannot be increased further once it reaches a certain limit. Therefore, improving production technology, adjusting labor organization, and solving all problems related to production have become the central link in improving production. Dalian's experience proves that in liberated areas, workers highly demonstrate creativity and actively propose suggestions for improving the irrational state of production, which is a common phenomenon. The trade union accepted the Soviet experience and launched a "rationalization proposal movement" among all workers, achieving brilliant results in the past three years. Workers at the Dalian Shipyard have put forward 247 "rationalization proposals" in three years, saving more than 10 million Guan Dong currency in materials. Workers in the broken car repair class of the Railway Factory proposed suggestions for improving the unreasonable phenomenon in labor organization, increasing work efficiency by nearly one time with the same number of people and time.

　　To do this work well, the administrative and trade union leaderships are required to be familiar with the technology and the problems that need to be solved urgently in the entire factory, and purposefully propose problems that need to be studied and improved, and do not let workers go all over the mountains and fields to engage in "inventions and creations." After workers put forward reform opinions to the administration and trade union, they must be approved by the administration, and then immediately help workers solve difficulties such as raw materials and machines, and mobilize technicians to help, which will improve workers' enthusiasm and vigorously launch this movement. Any worker's rationalization proposal that has a great effect on production, once adopted, should be rewarded according to the size of its effect (Soviet factories stipulate that 5% to 30% of the value of their inventions and creations should be rewarded). In order to promote production, it is also very necessary to promote and exchange experience in a timely manner. At present, Dalian has taken three methods: 1. Regularly convene forums on creative inventions and rationalization proposals. For mechanical matters, mechanical workers and related people are convened to participate in a meeting to study together, and the workers are very interested. 2. Hold technical lectures on Sundays. 3. Regularly organize relevant factories to visit each other. These have all achieved good results.

　　IV. Rewards
　　In order to encourage workers' outstanding production achievements and various creations and inventions, many factories have implemented scientific reward systems. Piecework wages are a good way to reward. The implementation of piecework wages is relatively common in Dalian factories. At the same time, there are also rationalization reward systems and reward systems for staff technical cadres. When the factory's task exceeds 5%, the factory director is rewarded with 10% of his salary, and when it exceeds 10%, the factory director's salary is doubled. From general workers to technical workers, staff, and cadres, reward systems are implemented. In addition to the political rewards of publicity and commendation, there are also daily material rewards. Since last year, ×× factory has always maintained its leading position in the competition. Not only has the workers' wages increased, but their lives have also improved. Each person has increased by 300 grams of pork, which is issued twice every two days; and 350 bicycles have been rewarded. Workers will definitely welcome such calls for production competition. Facts have proven that it is good for the country and for the workers. It is necessary to improve the factory management system and launch a production movement. In terms of trade union work, all work should be for the sake of production competition. Therefore, for the needs of production, labor insurance and welfare work should be strengthened, and workers should not be allowed to get sick during the competition; the most difficult families should be given relief, with the aim of stabilizing workers' production sentiment. The trade union's Culture and Education Department, Organization Department, and Welfare Department should all have one purpose - to serve production.

　　大连职工会在生产运动中的作用
　  东北工会工作经验之一
    大连各公营工厂的生产运动是从一九四六年开始的。三年以来，在工业的恢复发展与建设方面、在工厂的经营管理方面，以及职工运动方面都获得了显著的成绩和宝贵的经验，本文拟就这些方面，作一概括介绍。
    一、先把生产搞好
    大连解放之初，大批工人失业；在业的工人生活也很苦，甚至比日本帝国主义侵占时代的标准还低。在这种情况下，工会是搞生产还是搞福利呢？起初，职工会干部在思想上有很大分歧，有人主张“只有改善了生活，才能把生产搞好”，“工厂的工会就是搞福利和教育，这样就能保证生产”；虽然也有人主张“工人要改善生活，首先就得把生产搞好；生产搞不好，没法改善生活”；但因缺乏经验，还是第一个意见占了上风。有些工会工作同志为改善工人生活，就去做买卖，想赚钱养活工人，“改善工人生活”，搞了几个月搞垮了，连工厂也关了门。摸索来摸索去，到一九四六年，才摸索出一个办法——开展生产运动。事实证明，这是改善工人生活的唯一正确道路。现在大连工人的生活在东北是最高最好的，工人的实际工资比才解放时提高了百分之四十，物价却比那时降低了百分之四十六。东北各地接受了这个经验，当着工业城市解放之后，都是马上集中力量发展生产，从生产中来解决一切问题。认为必须经过长期的充分的准备，才能开展生产运动的陈旧思想，已经被大连的实际经验否定了。
    二、掌握生产计划，运用工会小组推动生产
    掌握生产计划是大连职工会保证完成生产任务的最重要方法之一。当行政上做出生产计划后，工会即召集工会干部和工人积极分子，研究能不能完成？怎样完成？能不能超过？能超过多少？经各部门研究订出工会的生产计划（这一计划经过全体工人反复讨论，工人的积极性创造性都提高了，常常会比行政上订的生产计划高一些），再把这个计划一层一层的布置下去，直到各小组研究订出自己的生产计划为止。在工会小组生活中，也是以生产为中心，经常检查完成计划的程度，研究实现计划的方法，生产中的许多问题都因而解决了。这种小组生活比较过去那种脱离生产的、空洞的检讨“态度”，讲“政治”领导和“学习”的小组生活丰富得多，充实得多。同时，职工会因为掌握了生产计划，发现问题可以及时解决，比较过去那种空喊保证生产任务，而连生产计划都不知道的情况有很大改进，避免了职工会在生产运动中的盲目性，真正给予生产运动以有力保证。
    三、奖励发明创造，开展“合理化建议”
    曾有一个时期，大连是用加强劳动强度的方法来提高生产，这固然能使工人积极负责，甚至加工很多；但也常常发生另一个偏向，比如常常因竞赛而引起大批病员，而且增强劳动强度是有一定限度的，到达一定限度就不能再增加了。因此，改进生产技术、调整劳力组织、解决和生产有关的一切问题，就成为提高生产的中心环节。大连的经验证明：在解放了的地区，职工们高度的发挥创造性，积极地提出改进生产上不合理状态的建议，是一种普遍的现象。职工会接受了苏联的经验，在全体工人中开展了“合理化建议运动”，三年来获得辉煌的成绩。大连造船厂的工人在三年中提出“合理化建议”二百四十七件，节省物资达关东币千余万元。铁路工厂破车修理班的工人提出改进劳力组织上的不合理现象的建议，在同样人数与时间内，提高工作效率几近一倍。
    要搞好这一工作，要求行政与工会领导上熟悉技术及全厂需要急待解决的问题，有目的地提出需要研究改进的问题，不要让工人满山遍野的去搞“创造发明”。当工人向行政与工会提出改造意见后，须经行政上同意批准，并随即帮助工人解决原料、机器等困难，动员技师来帮助，这样就会提高工人的积极性，热烈开展这个运动。凡工人提出的生产合理化建议，对生产确有很大效果的，一经采用，应即根据他效果的大小给以奖励（苏联工厂规定以其创造发明的价值的百分之五至百分之三十为奖励）。为推动生产，及时推广与交流经验也十分必要。目前大连采取的方法有三：一、经常召集创造发明合理化建议座谈会。关于机械的，就召集机械工人与有关者来参加，一起开会研究，工人兴趣很大。二、礼拜天举行技术讲座。三、经常组织有关工厂互相参观。这些都收到了很好的效果。
    四、奖励
    为了鼓励职工们卓越的生产成绩和各种创造与发明，许多工厂实行了科学的奖励制度。计件工资是一种奖励的好办法。大连工厂实行计件工资的比较普遍。同时还有合理化奖励制度与职员技术干部奖励制度。全厂任务超过百分之五时，当厂长的奖励其工资百分之十，超过百分之十，厂长工资加倍。从一般工人到技术工人、职员、干部，都实行奖励制度，除宣传表扬的政治奖励外，同时并有日常的物质奖励。××厂从去年到现在始终保持竞赛中的优胜地位，工人不但工资增加了，生活也提高了，每人增加三百格拉姆猪肉，两天发一次；又奖励了三百五十辆脚踏车。这样号召生产竞赛，工人必然欢迎。事实证明：对国家也好，对工人也好。必须改善工厂管理制度，开展生产运动，在工会工作方面，也应该一切工作是为了生产竞赛。因此，为了生产的需要，应加强劳动保险福利工作，不应使工人在竞赛当中害病；家庭最困难的给以救济，目的是为了安定工人生产情绪。工会的文教部、组织部、福利部都应是一个目的——为生产服务。
