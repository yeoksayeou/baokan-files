　　Chahar Provincial County and City Supply and Marketing Cooperatives Strengthen Ties
　　Counties Sign Mutual Production and Sales Contracts
　　Most Contracts Focus on Ordering Various Agricultural Tools
　　[This newspaper's Zhangjiakou dispatch] In order to enable the province's cooperatives to operate with unified planning, exert overall strength, and further promote the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas, the Chahar Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative convened a joint conference of directors of supply and marketing cooperatives from all counties and cities in the province in late August. At the meeting, after exchanging information on production and sales, the past barriers of mutual ignorance and lack of communication were broken down. Each county and city, based on its own needs, signed 33 supply and demand business contracts with each other. The contracts stipulated the style and quality of the goods, with the producing party guaranteeing certain specifications and mutual adherence to credit. Among the 33 contracts, 20 were for agricultural tools, ordering a total of 61,350 various agricultural tools. For example, Hunyuan County in Yanbei is rich in iron shovels. Wanquan, Lingqiu, Guangling, Longguan, Yanqing, Chicheng, Huailai, Xuanhua, Yangyuan and other nine county cooperatives ordered a total of 14,500 iron shovels from Hunyuan County Cooperative. Si Hai ordered 1,500 iron shovels from Datong City, and Shangdu ordered 1,500 from Huaian. Zhangbei and Baoyuan ordered 30,000 connected rake strips, 2,000 connected rake handles, 2,000 carrying baskets, and 500 wooden forks from Longguan. Wanquan, Datong, and Huade counties ordered a total of 1,000 wooden shovels, 1,100 wooden rakes, and 4,900 wooden forks from Yuxian County. Xuanhua County ordered 1,000 sickles from Xuanhua City; and ordered 1,000 earth molds from Zhuolu. Baoyuan and Zhangbei ordered 850 jin of rubber bands from Fujucheng Trading Company, and Shangdu ordered 2,000 reed mats, 4,000 water buckets, and 200 winnowing fans from Huaian. Zhangbei to Xuanhua City, Shangdu to Huaian, and Baoyuan to Si Hai Chicheng, respectively ordered a total of 1,000 animal-powered wooden carts. Lingqiu and Guangling ordered 60 handcarts from Hunyuan. In addition, Chahar Provincial Native Products Company signed contracts with Duolun, Chicheng, and Chongli counties respectively for the purchase of a total of 188,000 jin of medicinal materials, including red peony root, bupleurum, cangzhu, scutellaria, anemarrhena, and divine hemp, of which red peony root from Duolun accounted for 138,000 jin.
