　　Protesting the Fascist Atrocities in Peekskill
　  New York People Continue Demonstrations
    More Than 10,000 People Gather in Harlem Black District
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 16th] TASS, New York: The American people's protests against the fascist atrocities in Peekskill are increasing. On September 10th, in the Harlem black district of New York City, more than 10,000 people participated in a mass rally. On September 11th, more than 500 residents of Brooklyn participated in a march, following behind a car that was destroyed by thugs in Peekskill, demanding punishment for the murderers who launched the atrocities at the Robeson concert. A reporter from the American Communist Party's Worker's Daily reported: At the New York State CIO convention, many representatives listened with great interest to Strauss, one of the leaders of the CIO Fur Workers Union, describe the organization of the Robeson concert protection group. He said: "The meeting halls of various unions became centers for mobilizing volunteers who vowed to fight for democracy and ensure that the concert could be held. They believed that if the concert could not be held, then any picket line or union rally would be in danger of being attacked by fascists. But the concert was successfully held, and we won the victory in the battle for democracy."
