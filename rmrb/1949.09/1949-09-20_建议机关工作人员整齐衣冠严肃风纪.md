　　Suggestion to Government Staff to Dress Neatly and Maintain Serious Demeanor
    A few days ago, on the road from Qianmen to Xidan, I saw several people who looked like government staff. Their clothes were unbuttoned, revealing the flowered shirts underneath; they were holding pears and eating them while walking, which was unsightly. I often see government staff dressed sloppily and behaving casually on the road. Don't our uniforms have buttons? Why not button them up? I suggest that all staff members of government agencies and organizations learn from the discipline of the military, and not be sloppily dressed and act carelessly. I also hope that all government agencies and organizations strengthen education in this area for cadres.　　　　　(Jiang Rui)

　　建议机关工作人员整齐衣冠严肃风纪
    前几天从前门到西单的路上看见了几个机关工作人员模样的人，衣服扣子没扣，露着里边的花衬衣；手里拿着梨，边走边吃，很不好看。我在路上时常看到这样服装不整、举止散漫的机关工作人员。我们的制服不都有钮扣吗，为什么不扣上呢？我建议各机关团体工作人员，要学习军队人员的风纪，不要衣冠不整，拖拖踏踏。并望各机关团体加强干部这方面的教育。　　　　　（蒋锐）
