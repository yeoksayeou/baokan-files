Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 18th: TASS, London: "Reynold's News" published an article describing the appalling poverty of the Spanish people under the Franco regime. The article pointed out that the daily ration of black bread for the people is about 120 grams (equivalent to 3.8 taels). Only the rich can enjoy white bread that is not rationed. The agricultural workers' lunch is a slice of dry black bread and a slice of watermelon. They said, "When there is no work, we don't even get these things." There is no unemployment relief in Spain. Franco has never published a budget since 1943. It is believed that this is because he does not dare to reveal the true picture of the country's mess. When discussing the living conditions of the Spanish people, the article pointed out that in Barcelona, thousands of people live in caves dug along the railway embankment. The authorities are threatening to evict thousands of people from their riverside residences in order to make the area more "attractive" to tourists. People living in shacks invade "better" areas at night, begging or looting food in roadside ditches and mud piles. In these places, it is common to hear the noise of children and piglets picking things in the garbage heaps.

　　西班牙人民生活穷困
    【新华社北平十八日电】塔斯社伦敦讯：“雷诺新闻”发表一篇文章，叙述佛朗哥政权下西班牙人民可怖的穷困。该文指出，人民每日配给的黑面包重量约为一二○公分（合三两八钱）。只有富人才能享受不是配给的白面包。农业工人的午餐是一片干的黑面包与一片西瓜。他们说道：“当没有工作时，我们甚至于还得不到这些东西”。西班牙没有失业救济。佛朗哥自一九四三年以来即从未发表过预算。大家认为，这是因为他不敢把国家一团糟的真象透露出来。该文在谈到西班牙人民的居住条件时指出，在巴塞隆那，成千的人住在沿着铁路路基所挖的窑洞里。当局正在威胁着把数千人逐出河边的住所，为的是使那里更能“吸引”游客的雅兴。住在茅屋的人们在夜里侵入“较好”的地方，在路旁水沟里与泥堆里乞求或劫掠食物。在这些地方，听见小孩与小猪在垃圾堆里捡东西而噪闹的声音，乃是常事。
