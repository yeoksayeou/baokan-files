　　Starting from "Knowing Insufficiency After Learning"
    Dong Wen
    To be able to "know insufficiency" after learning indicates that one has broadened their horizons, begun to understand humility, and possesses a scientific attitude. Having such a learning attitude provides a foundation for progressive thinking, as it embodies a spirit of actively seeking advancement. Originally, this is a commendable phenomenon. However, in the minds of some comrades, "knowing insufficiency" is not such a humble and proactive expression (though it may seem humble), but rather a lack of perseverance, a lazy mindset, a passive and weary attitude towards learning, and a lack of sensitivity to new things. They perceive it this way: "Learning is not as good as not learning; it's better not to learn. The more one learns, the more one feels inadequate, with too many things one doesn't understand. This today, that tomorrow, it seems like the more one learns, the more bottomless it becomes." This statement represents a certain group's ideological understanding and attitude towards learning, illustrating that these comrades still lack a correct view of learning, their tenacity and combativeness on the learning front are still insufficient, and they still adhere to an empiricist way of thinking. The development of this kind of thinking will become an obstacle to the development of learning. If this obstacle is not overcome, it will affect both the individual's learning development and the forward momentum of the entire learning movement.
    How should we understand the issue of "insufficiency"?
    First, we must clearly recognize that learning itself is a battle. To achieve victory in this battle is a long and arduous process of accumulating "small victories" into "large victories," which requires gradual progress based on down-to-earth, step-by-step efforts. In a sense, its arduousness is no less than "charging into battle" on the military front. In the past, some people called reading "attacking books" and "studying bitterly." Learning should be "bitter," and books should be treated as "bunkers" to be "attacked." This is indeed a saying that "deeply captures the essence." We will not discuss the learning objectives and methods of "ten years of hard study by the window" or "hanging one's hair from the beams and pricking one's thighs with an awl." Of course, there is no need to advocate using these methods of rote learning as examples for our learning today, but in terms of the spirit of putting in "hard work," it is worth emulating. Reading is not like eating fruit, three bites and two chews, which can be quickly eaten, digested, and provide nutrition. Because our level of Marxism-Leninism was not high in the past, we will inevitably encounter many difficulties in books when we start learning today. At the same time, there are still many enemies within our minds, such as inertia, fear of difficulties, dogmatic and empiricist ways of thinking and learning, etc. To enable learning to develop forward, we must not only "attack" books, but also wage tireless struggles against these enemies in our minds, and the latter is especially important. Without the ideological foundation of waging tireless struggles against the enemies in our minds and achieving victory, there will be no proactive "book-attacking" combat actions. This is a struggle. Especially when learning Marxism-Leninism, which is a science, a playful or vague attitude will not allow us to learn accurately. We must be honest and earnest. Any attitude of "cutting corners," "glossing over," or being an ideological lazybones will result in no "harvest" for us. Marx and Lenin also demonstrated the most honest approach in their learning. In the preface to the French edition of "Das Kapital," Marx taught us:
    "There is no royal road to science, and only those who do not dread the fatiguing climb of its steep paths have a chance of gaining its luminous summits."
    Lenin was also like this. In "A Brief Biography of Lenin's Life and Work," there is a passage about Lenin completing four years of university courses in one year when he was twenty years old. Quoting Lenin's sister Anna describing Lenin's preparations for the university exam, she said:
    "What surprised many people at that time was that he was expelled from the university, but he was able to prepare so well in just one year without any help from others and without any academic year exams or semester exams, and he completed all the course exams at once. In addition to his outstanding abilities, what prompted Lenin to do this was his tremendous ability to work..."
    "He set up a solitary study for himself in the middle of a dense linden tree-shaded path... Every morning, after breakfast, he would take a large batch of books and run there, adhering to the time so strictly, as if a stern teacher was waiting for him to attend the lecture. There, he completely concentrated on studying alone until 3 p.m. when it was time for lunch... After finishing his homework and having lunch, he would take books on social issues to that corner..."
    In his youth, Lenin demonstrated such a high degree of diligence and seriousness in his self-study spirit that he achieved such brilliant achievements. This spirit was not only in his learning, but also permeated his entire career thereafter, and this spirit needs to be learned by us without any discount.
    Secondly, the development of learning, like the development of any other thing, follows the laws of dialectical development. When finishing reading a book or studying a problem, due to the limitations of one's level and knowledge, what is inevitable is not that one can completely understand the book or the problem thoroughly without any doubts, but that there are results in both "knowing" and "not knowing." On the one hand, in the process of learning, one learns many new things, understands many new principles that one did not understand in the past, and adds many new knowledge that one did not have in the past. This improves one's learning mood and encourages one's interest and courage in learning. On the other hand, one must also encounter many difficulties or things that one cannot understand temporarily, which requires continued learning, further theoretical improvement, and further strengthening of Marxist-Leninist cultivation and accumulation of more knowledge before they can be solved. This also requires us to muster the confidence and courage to delve into and pursue, use our brains to think, and deeply excavate, and should not "stop when encountering difficulties." "Knowing" and "not knowing" are a contradiction, but by constantly resolving this contradiction, our learning can continue to develop forward.
    Lenin instructed so clearly in "On the State":
    "...Therefore, never expect that this issue can be fully understood in a short speech. After the first speech, you must write down what you do not understand or do not understand clearly, so that you can study these issues for the second, third, and fourth time; those things that you do not understand must be continued to be studied by supplementing them from reading, individual lectures, and conversations in the future..."
    "...Although some people may be intimidated by the difficulties described in these works, I must remind you once again: Don't panic about this fact. Things that you don't understand when reading for the first time will be understood when reading for the second time or when studying this issue from another perspective later..."
    "...Therefore, for such issues, everyone who is willing to think about them seriously and understand them independently must study them several times, repeatedly study them, and think about them from all aspects in order to obtain a clear and definite understanding..."
    Lenin was talking about the problem of studying the state at that time, but in fact, this spirit is also completely suitable for our general learning. This is the Marxist-Leninist attitude towards learning, and it is the concrete embodiment of the proletariat's tenacious combativeness in learning life.
    We should not fantasize that there is such a person: this person will not encounter difficulties in learning, or really has "profound talent and erudition" and can solve difficulties "immediately" without any effort. Maybe there is, but only relatively speaking, that is also the result of arduous learning accumulation. A "greedy" learning attitude of "swallowing a pancake in one bite and digging a well with one shovel" will also prevent us from achieving any success.
    Again, "learning has no end." This sentence has a certain truth. Explained from the Marxist-Leninist point of view, this is the continuous development of things and the continuous occurrence of new things. Therefore, it requires us to continuously learn, not to be satisfied with "following the rules," or to妄想 to come up with some "once and for all" plan in learning. There is no such magic weapon in the world. If Marxism-Leninism is a "magic weapon," then this "magic weapon" can only give you a basic stand, viewpoint, and method as your "guide to action," but it can never solve and write down things decades later for you to enjoy effortlessly. Therefore, we must learn new things every day to keep up with tomorrow's development. Since we are materialists, our motto should be: uninterrupted learning. This is not "bottomless," but precisely in line with the laws of development of objective things. Otherwise, we will not be able to closely follow tomorrow, and the changed objective things will conflict with our subjective understanding, which will lead to mistakes in analyzing problems or handling practical work. "Learn, learn, and learn again" is by no means an abstract slogan, but contains a scientific understanding of the content. Chairman Mao said that he still wants to be a primary school student, so what about us?
    To be a good student of Chairman Mao, our learning attitude should not be a lazy and fatigued attitude of fearing difficulties, we must constantly fight against these bad phenomena that hinder learning, and replace it with the positive spirit of "never being tired of learning" and "learning again and again."

　　从“学而后知不足”谈起
    东文
    学而后能“知不足”这表示已经放开眼界，开始知道虚心，是一种科学的态度，有了这样一种学习态度，便有了进步的思想基础，因为它是包含着积极求进的精神的。本来，这是一种可喜的现象。但是，在有一些同志思想上，“知不足”却不是如此虚心积极的表示（虽然看起来很虚心），而是一种缺乏毅力，是一种怠惰思想，是对学习表现为消极疲倦的态度，是缺少对新事物的敏感。他们这样认识：“学习不如不学习，不学还好，越学越觉得自己不行，不懂的东西太多，今天这，明天那，好象越学越没得底似的。”这种说法，是代表了一种人对学习的思想认识与学习态度的，说明了这些同志对学习还缺乏正确的看法，在学习战线上的顽强性战斗性还很不够，还是一种经验主义的思想方法，这种思想的发展，将会成为阻碍学习发展的一关，这一关如果不突破，则对个人的学习发展和整个学习运动的向前推动都将受到影响。
    我们应当怎样认识所谓“不足”的问题呢？
    首先，我们必须明确的认识到学习本身便是战斗，要在这个战斗中取得胜利，是一个积“小胜”为“大胜”长期艰苦的过程，是需要在脚踏实地、点滴努力的基础上逐步前进的，在某种意义上说来，其艰苦性并不下于军事战线上的“冲锋陷阵”。从前有人把读书叫做“攻书”，叫做“苦学”，学要“苦”，书要当做碉堡来“攻”，这确是“深得其中三味”的说法。“十年窗下苦”“头悬梁，锥刺股”的苦学，我们姑不论他的学习目的学习方法如何，当然更不必提倡用这些读死书的方法来做我们今天学习的榜样，但就这种下“苦功”的学习精神来说，却值得效法的。读书不是吃水果，三咬两嚼，马上可以吃下去消化营养，由于我们过去马列主义的水平不高，今天开始学习，必然会在书本子里遇到许多困难，同时，在我们思想内部也还存在有许多敌人，如惰性，怕困难，教条主义、经验主义的思想方法学习方法等等，要使学习能向前发展，不但必须向书“进攻”，还要向自己思想上的这些敌人作不疲乏的斗争，而后者尤其重要。没有向自己思想上敌人作不疲乏的斗争并取得胜利的思想基础，便不会有积极“攻书”的战斗行动，这是一个斗争。尤其是学习马列主义，它是一门科学，调皮或含糊点都不能使我们学得准确，必须老老实实，任何“偷工减料”“轻描淡写”，做思想上懒汉的态度都会使我们没有“收成”的。马克思、列宁在学习中也是表现为最老实的人。在“资本论”法文版序言中，马克思教育我们：
    “在科学上是没有宽广平坦的大道的，只有不畏疲劳地循着它的崎岖曲径而攀登上去的人，才能达到它光辉的顶峰。”
    列宁也是如此，在“列宁生平事业简史”中，有一段说到列宁在二十岁时，用一年功夫研究完毕大学四年课程的情形，引用列宁姐姐安娜描述列宁准备应大学考试的情形时说：
    “当时使许多人惊奇的，是他被开除大学学籍，而竟能在短短一年当中没有任何别人帮助且未经过任何学年考试和学期考试，却终究准备得如此好，而一下子就把全部课程考试完毕了，除卓越的本事而外，促成列宁此举的，是他那种巨大的工作能力。……”
    “他在一条丛密的菩提树荫道中间给自己布置了一个孤独的书房……。每日清晨，吃完早餐以后，他就带起一大批书册跑到那里去，如此严守时刻，似乎有一位严峻的教师在等候他到堂听讲一样，在那里，完全是独自一人静心攻读，一直到下午三点钟吃午餐的时候为止，……习完功课，吃过中餐以后，他又带着社会问题书籍跑到那个角落里去……”。
    在年青时代的列宁，便表现出如此高度勤勉认真的自学精神，以致获得那样辉煌的成就。这一精神不仅在他的学习中，而且以后贯串在他整个的事业中莫不如此，这种精神是需要我们不打一点折扣的去学习的。
    其次，学习的发展与其他任何事物的发展规律一样，是辩证的发展，当读完一本书或学习一个问题结束的时候，由于水平及知识的限制，必然的并不是把这本书或这个问题能完全搅得透澈无遗、一点疑问也没有，而是存在着“知”与“不知”两方面的结果。一方面是在学习过程中学到许多新的东西，懂得了过去所不懂得的许多新道理，增添了过去所没有的许多新知识，这便提高了学习情绪，鼓励了学习的兴趣和勇气；而在另一方面也一定要遇到许多疑难或暂时还不能懂得的东西，这就必须继续学习，从理论上继续提高，进一步加强马列主义的修养及积累更多的知识之后才能解决，这也就必须鼓起我们钻研追求的信心和勇气，用脑思索，深入挖掘，不应“遇难而止”。“知”与“不知”这两方面是个矛盾，但不断的解决这个矛盾，我们的学习便能不断的向前发展。
    列宁在“论国家”中指示得是如此明白：
    “……因此，决不要期望，在一次简短的演说中，就可将这个问题得到完全的了解。在第一次讲演之后，你们必须把还不了解的或还不明白的地方记下来，以便第二次、第三次、第四次去研究这些问题；那些不懂的地方，以后要从阅读中，从个别的讲演和谈话中，加以补充的继续研究。…”
    “…虽然有些人还会被这些著作中叙述的困难所吓倒，但必须再提醒你们一次：不必为这个事实而惊慌，第一次阅读时不懂的东西，在第二次阅读时或者以后从另外的角度来研究这问题时，就会懂得的…”
    “…因此，对于这样的问题，每个愿意认真地加以思索，独立地加以了解的人，都必须研究几次，反复钻研，从各方面加以思索，以便获得明白确定的了解。…”
    列宁说的是当时研究的国家问题，其实，这种精神对我们一般的学习也都是完全适合的。这就是对待学习的马列主义的态度，是无产阶级坚韧的战斗性在学习生活中的具体体现。
    我们不要幻想有那么一种人：这种人在学习中不会遇到困难或者真是有“渊才博学”不化一点劲能遇难“即”解，也许有，但只是相对而言的，那也是艰苦学习积累的成果。“一口吞饼，一锹挖井”的“好高鹜远”的学习态度，同样是会使我们得不到任何成功的。
    再次，“学无止境”，这句话是有它一定的道理，用马列主义的观点来解释，这就是事物不断的发展，新事物不断的发生，于是，便要求我们不断的学习，不能满足于“墨守成规”，或者妄想在学习中来个什么“一劳永逸”之计，世界上没有这种法宝。如果说马列主义是个“法宝”，那这个“法宝”也只能给你一种基本的立场、观点、方法，作为你“行动的指南”，却决不能把数十年以后的事情都给你解决了写上去，让你毫不吃力的去享用。因此，我们就必须每天每天去学习新的事物，才能赶得上明天的发展，我们既然是唯物主义者，我们的座右铭就应该是：不间断的学习。这不是“没有底”，而正是合乎客观事物的发展规律的。否则，我们便不能紧追明天，变化了的客观事物便会与我们的主观认识发生矛盾，这便会在分析问题或处理实际工作时犯错误。“学习，学习，再学习，”决不是一句抽象的口号，而是包含着一种科学认识的内容的。毛主席说他还要做小学生，那么，我们呢？
    要做毛主席的好学生，我们的学习态度就不应该是害怕困难的怠惰疲塌态度，就必须不间断的与这些妨碍学习的坏现象作斗争，而代之以“学之不厌”“学而再学之”的积极精神。
