　　Ten-Day Study Session
  　Cadre Training at the Ping City Youth League Rectification School

    Following the conclusion of the Youth Academy and Party Training Class, the study session for cadres at the Beiping City Youth League Rectification School has begun.

    After more than a month of summer study, the students' level of awareness has generally improved. How to develop leadership and organizational work on the basis of existing progress is a concern for the cadres. The purpose of holding the study session is to solve this problem—to improve the level of work. On the one hand, they study, and on the other hand, they hold cadre meetings to review the work since liberation based on the reports of responsible comrades and summarize experiences. Based on the basic situation, they plan the work for the next phase.

    The leadership pointed out that studying is the basic task of the League in schools and issued a new battle call, urging the development of New Democracy studies in the next phase. Although the League called for a return to the classroom as early as April, many people have not yet freed themselves from the constraints of heavy work. In between, they participated in summer work, so they believed that being an excellent League member meant doing the work perfectly, including organizing recreational activities, running clubs, and organizing study groups. But what about their own studies? They have always been placed outside of their tasks. A comrade from Beijing Normal University said, "I used to think work was important, and I felt like an excellent League member even though I failed math!"

    Comrade Jiang Nanxiang's report pointed out that the premise of school work has undergone a historical shift. The guiding principle of the student movement in the future is to build people's schools, cultivate New Democratic culture, and build talent. At the same time, he pointed out that in schools where students generally have awareness, New Democracy studies should be launched to criticize and transform the old curriculum, making it national, scientific, and people-oriented. Attention should also be paid to its long-term and systematic characteristics, and efforts should be well-combined and promoted by teachers and administrators to complete this task. In connection with this report, comrades reviewed the work in the half-year since liberation. Initially, under the call to transform learning, two main deviations emerged. One was that students returned to the classroom but still accepted the old curriculum without criticism. League members thought, "Are we still learning this after liberation?" But new things could not be started immediately, so they hesitated in the gap between the old and the new. Another deviation was that students in liberal arts colleges, such as Peking University, had better conditions and quickly clamored for reform, hastily and stiffly removing the old and replacing it with the new. They could not base learning methods on the objective environment and did not pay attention to ideological transformation, immediately dividing into groups for discussion. Because they neglected the long-term nature of transforming learning and lacked planned and systematic reform, they were eager for quick success, resulting in a decline after the climax. This stage of learning was like malaria, proceeding erratically. In middle schools, the task was to restore order to learning and remove obstacles to learning. In March, the League proposed a return to learning, and all work revolved around the call to study. Most comrades returned, but many felt a contradiction between learning and work. In private middle schools, such as Pingmin, some comrades held multiple positions, serving on the student council, school affairs committee, education committee... a long list of institutions and titles, running around until their shoes were worn out. Occasionally attending class, they were "in the classroom, but their minds were at the meeting." Some League members separated learning from work, believing that if they wanted to work, they could not study, and if they wanted to study, they had to sacrifice work. These were all deviations. In the discussion, comrades criticized that the contradiction between learning and work was mainly due to problems with work methods: failing to mobilize students to divide labor properly, not trusting the masses, taking everything on themselves, forming a paternalistic approach, being busy themselves, and other comrades having nothing to do. Work and learning should be unified. If there is a contradiction, it is self-created.

    Comrades in technical colleges generally had a conflict between political study and professional study. Some comrades felt: "If you don't study politics, are you still a League member? I don't want to go back to the old way of learning." Some comrades were trapped in the old courses, complaining every day that they had no time for political study. If they wanted to learn, they wished they could understand Marxism-Leninism in one or two months. Now they realize that professional work itself must include and be related to politics, and political study itself must be specifically expressed through professional study. They also realize that political study includes ideological transformation and the study of Marxism-Leninism, which must be carried out in a planned manner over a long period of time to be completed.

    In connection with Comrade Xu Liqun's report, a review of the League-masses relationship over the past six months was conducted. Some comrades used to separate League members from the masses, with League members and students each doing their own thing, with an invisible gap in between. Many comrades said that in the previous period, they did not understand that the League's resolutions were to realize the demands of the masses, and that implementing the resolutions was to serve the students. When students did not understand the opposition, they did not explain it, but rigidly implemented it and mechanically completed the task, resulting in people saying that the interests of the League conflicted with the interests of the masses. League members themselves could not understand it and ambiguously acquiesced to this misconception. Now they know that the League and the youth masses are closely related, that the League safeguards the long-term interests of the youth masses, and that League members and students should be as close as fish and water.

    Regarding uniting students, comrades also have a deeper understanding: one-sided emotional unity and unprincipled harmony are absolutely unacceptable. Now that the situation has changed, we can and must raise ideological issues for struggle head-on, but that does not mean that we do not need emotion to connect. On the contrary, we should pay more attention to the students' living problems, understand their ideological situation, and gradually improve them.

    Through this study, comrades have found problems in their past work and solved them. The midwifery school used to be disunited within the League. The branch secretary did not trust the masses and looked down on the League members. At meetings, they did not speak to each other, and the branch committee members frowned all day long. After this study clarified the situation, everyone became harmonious. The branch committee members who used to worry all day now have smiles on their faces.

    In order to build people's schools and cultivate talents for the construction of New China, it is necessary to criticize and transform the old learning content. However, students must cooperate with teachers, administrators, and educational institutions to actively promote these tasks. Today, as Comrade Yang Bozhen of the Municipal Youth Committee said: "On the ideological front, we must continue to struggle." Strive for true unity in the struggle—ideological consensus.　　　　　　　　End

　　学习会十天
  　平市青年团整训学校干部学习
    自德
    继青年学园和党训班结束之后，北平市青年团整训学校干部的学习会开学了。
    经过一月多暑期学习，同学们觉悟程度普遍提高，如何在既已进步的基础上展开领导与组织工作。干部们都有点担心，举办学习会，就是要解决这个问题——提高工作水平。一方面学习，同时也在开干部大会，根据负责同志的报告检查解放后的工作，并总结经验。再根据基本情况，计划下期的工作。
    领导上指出：学习是团在学校里的基本任务，并提出新的战斗号召，下期要展开新民主主义的学习。虽然早在四月，团就号召回到课堂去，但是直到现在好多人还没有从重重工作的羁绊里解脱出来，中间又参加了暑期工作，于是他们就认定了作为一个优秀团员，就是如何把工作做得尽善尽美，这些工作包括搞康乐活动、办社团与组织学习小组。但是自己的学习呢？却始终放在任务之外。北师一位同志说：“以前总以为工作重要，数学不及格，还觉得自己是个优秀团员哩！”
    蒋南翔同志的报告指出目前学校工作的前提，已有历史性的转变。今后的学运方针是建设人民的学校，培育新民主主义的文化与建设人材。同时他指出在同学们普遍有觉悟性的学校里，应展开新民主主义的学习，批判改造旧课程，使它具有民族的、科学的、人民大众的内容，而且要注意它的长期性与系统性的特点，好好结合并推动教师与行政的努力，完成这个任务。联系着这个报告，同志们检讨了解放后半年的工作。最初在改造学习的号召下，主要产生了两种偏向，一种是同学们回到课堂去了，仍然不加批判接受旧课程，团员们心里想，“解放后还学这一套吗？”但是新的又不能马上搞起来，于是在新旧的夹缝里彷徨。另一个偏向是文法学院的同学如北大吧，条件比较好，就很快嚷开了改制，匆匆的生硬的去掉旧的，换上新的，对于学习方法也不能根据客观环境，不注意思想改造，马上分好小组展开讨论。因为忽略了改造学习的长期性，缺乏计划性、系统性的改革，急于求功，结果造成高潮后的低落。这一阶段的学习象发疟疾一样，左右摇摆不定的进行着。在中学里则是恢复学习秩序，扫清学习障碍。三月里，团提出回到学习中去，一切工作围绕学习的号召，大部同志回去了，但不少同志却感到学习与工作的矛盾。私立中学如平民吧，有些同志一人身兼数职，学生会、校务会、教务会……一大串机构与头衔，跑得皮鞋都磨破了，偶尔上课，也是“身在课堂，心在会上”。有些团员把学习与工作割裂开来，认为要工作就不能学习，要学习就只有牺牲工作。这些都是偏向。同志们在讨论中批判了学习工作矛盾主要是工作方法有问题：不发动同学好好分工，不信任群众，什么事都往自己身上揽，形成包办代替，自己忙得溜溜转，别的同志没事干。工作与学习应该是统一的，假若有矛盾只是自己干出来的。
    理工学院的同志普遍存在着政治学习与业务学习的矛盾。有的同志觉得：“不学习政治还象个团员吗？不愿回到旧学习中去。也有些同志陷在旧功课里，天天叫没有时间搞政治学习。要学也恨不得一两月就把马列主义搞通，现在才知道业务本身必须包括并联系政治，政治学习本身也要通过业务学习而具体表现出来。并且认识政治学习包括思想改造与马列主义的学习，必须经过长时期有计划的进行，才能完成。
    联系着许立群同志的报告，把半年来的团群关系作了一番检查。有的同志以前把团员与群众分得开开的，团员与同学各搞一套，中间有一条无形的鸿沟。很多同志说，上期没有了解组织决议就是实现群众的要求，执行决议也就是为同学们服务。同学们不了解反对时，也不进行解释工作，生硬地执行，机械地完成任务，结果人家说团的利益与群众的利益是冲突的。团员们自己搞不通，也半信半疑的对这个错觉不置可否。现在知道团与青年群众血肉相关，团是维护青年群众的长远利益的，团员与同学应该水乳交融。
    关于团结同学，同志们也有更深入的了解：片面的感情团结和无原则的一团和气是绝对行不通的。现在形势变了，我们可以而且必须正面提出思想问题来斗争了，但又不是不需要感情来联系，相反的，我们要多关怀同学的生活问题，了解他们的思想情况，以逐步提高。
    通过这段学习，同志们在过去工作中找出了问题，也解决了问题。助产学校以前团内不团结，支书不信任群众，瞧不起团员，开会时彼此不言语，支委整天皱眉头。这次学习检查清楚后，大伙儿才搞得融融洽洽的。以前整天发愁的支委，现在也眉开眼笑了。
    为了建设人民的学校，培养新中国的建设人材，必须要批判改造旧的学习内容，但是这些工作，同学们要配合教员、行政及教育机关的共同努力，而且要去主动推展。今天正如市青委杨伯箴同志说的：“在思想战线上我们还要不断作斗争。”在斗争中求得真正的团结——思想上的一致。　　　　　　　　完
