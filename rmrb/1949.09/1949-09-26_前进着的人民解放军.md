The Advancing People's Liberation Army
    Song Zhidi

    In November 1948, the Fourth Field Army Propaganda Team of the People's Liberation Army wrote five large red characters at the mouth of Shanhaiguan Pass: "Victory is at our feet!" Since then, the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army have crossed countless rivers and valleys, crushed any enemy who dared to resist along the way, conquered all natural and man-made disasters from forty degrees below zero to over one hundred degrees of sweltering heat, and advanced five or six thousand more *li*, reaching the Yushan Mountains of Hubei, Jiangxi, and Hunan. At the strategic Tiantun Pass, the propaganda team wrote eight more eye-catching characters: "Heroes are seen in hardship!" Only heroes who dare to sacrifice themselves – fearless soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, only heroes and good men who selflessly fight to create a people's homeland and are experiencing all hardships, can deeply appreciate the practical significance of these two slogans.

    Accustomed to the open and wide plains of the north, the soldiers were unaccustomed to the spider-web-like paddy field ridges and log bridges of the south, but they conquered all of this and advanced. Large-scale tactical exercises began, from wide to narrow, from flatlands to crooked ridges, from slow to fast, from seeing the road to not seeing the road at all. Before long, the soldiers could run across any type of ridge or log bridge with their eyes closed.

    With the heat, rain, many mosquitoes, sleeping in the open, and regardless of fatigue, diseases increased, but they still conquered all of this and advanced. When the medicine ran out, rural folk remedies were spread, using eggs and garlic to treat dysentery, almonds to treat malaria, a wild mountain herb called "stinky urine" to treat heatstroke, and caring for each other with class feelings.

    When the Party called for valiant advancement to seize the enemy, no hardship in the world could hinder the people's soldiers from advancing. Their clothes were wet one way or another, wet with sweat when it didn't rain, and soaked when it did rain. Let them be wet. As long as the enemy doesn't escape. The roads of advancement were destroyed by the White bandits, and all bridges and villages were burned. Along a line of march hundreds of *li* long were campsites and cooking stoves. The soldiers camped in the open. Some units waded across forty or more rivers in a single day, and some units marched continuously for a week in torrential rain. At these times, the soldiers had only one strong wish in their hearts, and enthusiastically encouraged each other with it. This was to perform the first meritorious service in liberating Jiangnan.

    When climbing the steep 40-degree slopes of the Mufu Mountains on precipices and cliffs, the army ran out of food. The winding mountain path, so narrow that if a single pack animal stopped, it would block the entire advance, and army rations could not be supplied in time. The Mufu Mountains were covered with tea trees, tung trees, jujube trees, and bamboo forests, but there were no homes. Back in the days of the Agrarian Revolutionary War, the homes in the Mufu Mountains had been burned down by Chiang's bandit troops. At that time, this was General Peng Dehuai's base area. So every day, each person counted their food not in *jin* (a unit of weight) but in *liang* (a smaller unit of weight), with the richest company averaging no more than four *liang* of rice per person per day. The soldiers, rich in class friendship, could not help but share some of it with those more impoverished class brothers in other units who were sharing life and death together. And when a feeder looked at his bowl of rice and stared at the horse beside him in a daze, the soldiers discussed that the horse had run out of fodder. These warhorses had walked all the way from the Northeast to here, carrying machine guns on their backs all the way. They had also made contributions! So everyone decided to divide up some more grain to feed the horses. Thus, in a situation where they could only drink one and a half meals of thin rice gruel a day, the soldiers bravely advanced.

    Peaches on both sides of the mountain road were already ripe. This was the only thing in the mountains that could be eaten, but no one paid attention to it, as if they didn't exist at all. The soldiers understood who these peaches belonged to. They had seen the battle slogans that still occasionally remained in the mountains from the Agrarian Revolutionary War period: "Expand the Red Army, consolidate the Soviet Area," "Poor peasants and farm laborers join the Red Army." These were our slogans, our people had fought here with our ideals, and had never stopped fighting. Their legacy still inspires us today, and these peach trees probably belong to their descendants who remained in the mountains.

    Descending the Mufu Mountains is the birthplace of the Hunan revolution, Chairman Mao's hometown. When the People's Liberation Army advanced to Pingjiang, the famous base area created by General Peng Dehuai during the Agrarian Revolutionary War, the people of Pingjiang welcomed the return of their own troops with unparalleled enthusiasm. The people repaired bridges and roads, and set up tea stalls at every possible intersection along the route the troops might take. Some elderly people also rushed to tell the young soldiers stories of the old Red Army, and they habitually called Chiang's bandit troops the White Army, and the People's Liberation Army the Red Army. "Has Peng Dehuai returned?" "Where is he?" The soldiers proudly and naturally puffed out their chests and replied: "He is our Deputy Commander-in-Chief!"

    Hunan, known for its Xiang River and Mount Luyun, had suffered countless hardships in the nineteen years since the Red Army began its famous Long March. An old gentleman said: "Truly, every inch of mountain and river is soaked with blood and tears!" The brave, resolute, enthusiastic, and imaginative people of Hunan had experienced the cruel ravages of the Japanese invaders and Chiang's bandit troops, the "Great Victory Famine" jointly created by Chiang and the United States in 1946, and the burning, killing, and looting by the White bandits during their retreat. Even the most conservative people had only one hope left in their hearts, hoping that Mao Zedong's troops would return victoriously as soon as possible. The people of Hunan knew that only Chairman Mao's troops had the courage and perseverance to shoulder and conquer all these hardships, and to rescue them from suffering.

    On the night of August 5th, when the People's Liberation Army peacefully entered Changsha, the fervor of the people of Changsha was indescribable. Although there was a threat of bombing by Chiang's bandit planes that day, even the people scattered in the surrounding villages rushed into the city after learning that the Liberation Army was about to enter the city. On that day, firecrackers and red and green paper were snapped up in Changsha, and fresh flowers and fruits became rare treasures in the market. The enthusiastic crowd waited from six o'clock until eleven o'clock in the evening, their enthusiasm growing ever higher, because people kept spreading the word: "They're coming, they're coming." So by the time they really arrived, almost all the firecrackers in the city had been set off, and the inventory in the firecracker shops was mostly empty. The workers' welcome trucks had driven to the Dongtun ferry crossing on the Liuyang River in the morning, and the students' singing had not stopped. At eleven o'clock, when the Liberation Army's propaganda trucks, as the vanguard, drove into Changsha from the Dongtun ferry crossing, they had no time to do any propaganda or even say a few words of thanks. The young students swarmed forward, shaking hands and hugging, and at first there were some heroic slogans, "Welcome the People's Liberation Army!" "Long Live Chairman Mao!" Later, there was only "Long Live!", and finally even "Long Live!" was not enough, and what resounded through the sky was a vast ocean of joyful shouting. The soldiers were covered with flowers, and their pockets were filled with who knows how many things by how many hands, cookies, cigarettes, and flowers were thrown into the trucks from all directions. The soldiers tried to throw them back to the welcoming people, but more were thrown in. Some female students just stretched out their hands to the soldiers, and tears welled up in their red faces. The famous scholar Huang Zhigang said: Since the Ma-Ri Incident, in those dark days, although he had witnessed many revolutionary youths being tied up and killed, he gritted his teeth and endured it, he had no tears; but on August 5th, when he saw the red-faced, sweating, and heroic People's Liberation Army soldiers engulfed in this carnival sea, he cried, unable to speak! Chairman Mao's soldiers had returned! The people had their own army! The darkness had come to an end, and a new people's democratic country had risen!

    In Pingjiang, an old lady boasted that General Peng Dehuai had lived in her house, which was General Peng Dehuai's headquarters at the time. Her two sons had joined the Red Army and left. She asked: "Where are they now?" A young farmer greeted the Liberation Army soldiers as naturally and familiarly as if they were his own relatives. He said that he had never met his father, who had joined the Red Army while his mother was still pregnant. He asked: "Will he come back?" They will all come back, her sons and his father may not come back, but their ideals and careers have truly and realistically returned! Her sons and his father, under the leadership of the Communist Party, bravely and fearlessly created a new people's democratic country, and this country has come! In order not to give any chance to the remnants of the enemy of this country to catch their breath, the People's Liberation Army overcomes all difficulties, crosses Changsha, and continues to advance!

### 前进着的人民解放军

　　前进着的人民解放军
    宋之的
    一九四八年十一月，人民解放军第四野战军宣传队在山海关口，写了五个红色大字：“胜利在脚上！”从那时起，人民解放军的战士们，越过无数河川山谷，粉碎了前进途中任何敢于抵抗的敌人，从零下四十度的严寒到一百多度的酷暑，征服了一切自然与人为的灾难，又前进了五六千里，到达了鄂赣湘的庾山山岭。在险要的天屯关口，宣传队又以夺目的颜色写下了八个大字：“英雄好汉艰苦中看！”只有勇于牺牲自己的英雄——无畏的人民解放军战士，只有为了创造人民的祖国而无私的战斗着，并正经历着一切艰苦的英雄好汉，才能深切地体会到这两个标语的实际意义。
    习惯了北方开阔宽坦的大平原的战士们，不习惯南方蛛网式的水田田埂和独木桥，但他们征服了这一切并前进着。大规模的战术练习开始了，从宽阔的到狭隘的，从平川地到歪斜的田埂，从慢到快，从看到路到完全看不到路，没有多久，任何样式的田埂和独木桥，战士们都可以闭着眼睛跑过去了。
    随着酷热、阴雨、蚊多、露宿和不顾疲劳，疾病增加了，但他们仍然征服了这一切并前进着。当医药用光的时候，乡间的土办法便传布开了，用鸡蛋大蒜治痢，用杏仁治疟疾，用一种名叫“臭尿”的山间野草治中暑，并以阶级的感情互相关切着。
    当党号召奋勇前进抓住敌人的时候，没有什么人世间的艰苦可以使人民的战士阻滞不前。衣服横竖是湿的，不下雨的时候汗湿，下雨时淋湿，随它去湿好了，只要不让敌人跑掉。前进道路被白匪破坏，并烧毁了一切桥梁村舍，数百里的一条行进线上全是野营的锅灶，战士们露宿着。有的部队一天跋涉过四十几道河川，有的部队在倾盆大雨下曾连续行进了一个星期，这些时候，战士们心里便仅剩下了一个坚强的愿望，并热情地以此相互鼓励，这就是解放江南立头功。
    在翻越悬崖断壁四十度陡坡的幕阜山时，军中断了粮。曲折而上的羊肠小道只要一匹牲口停下来便阻住了全体的进路，军粮一时供应不上。幕阜山遍山野是茶树、梧桐、枣子树和竹林，但却没有人家。还在土地革命战争时期，幕阜山的人家便被蒋匪军烧光了。当时这里是彭德怀将军的根据地。于是每天每人不是以斤而是以两计算着粮食，最富裕的连队每人每天也不过平均到四两米。富于阶级友爱的战士们，又不能不分出一部分给那些更贫苦的、生死与共的阶级兄弟部队。而当一个饲养员端起饭碗眼望着身边的马出神时，战士们就讨论起马已绝了草料了。这些战马从东北走到这里，一路驮着机枪没下过背，它也有功啦！于是大家决定再分出一部粮食喂马。就这样在一天只能喝一顿半饱的稀水饭的情形下，战士们奋勇前进着。
    山路两侧桃子已经熟了。这是山中唯一可以下肚的东西，但没有人理睬，仿佛它们根本没有存在似的，战士们懂得这些桃子是属于谁的。他们曾看见了土地革命战争时期在山中还偶然残存的战斗字迹：“扩大红军巩固苏联埃”、“贫雇农到红军中来”。这是我们的标语，我们的人曾在这儿怀抱着我们的理想战斗过，并且一直没有停止过战斗。他们的遗迹在今天还鼓舞着我们，而这桃树说不定正属于他们残留在山中的后代的。
    翻下幕阜山便是湖南革命的发源地，毛主席的故乡。当人民解放军前进到平江，那在土地革命时期为彭德怀将军所创造的著名根据地的时候，平江人民以无比的热情欢迎着自己部队的归来。人民修桥补路，在部队可能通过的路口，遍设茶水棚。一些上了年岁的人也抢着为年青的战士们讲述过去老红军的故事，他们按照习惯称蒋匪军为白军，称人民解放军为红军。“彭德怀回来了没有？”“他在那儿？”战士们兴奋而且自然地挺起了胸膛回答：“他是我们的副总司令！”
    以湘水麓云著称的湖南，自从红军开始了著名的两万五千里长征以后，十九年中遭受了难以数计的苦难。一个老先生说：“真有寸寸山河寸寸血泪！”勇敢、坚毅、热情、富于想象的湖南人民，经历了日寇和蒋匪的残酷蹂躏，经历了一九四六年蒋美合伙制造的“胜利大灾荒”，经历了白匪撤退时的烧杀淫掠，就连最保守的人在心里也只剩下一个企望，企望着毛泽东的队伍早日胜利归来。湖南人民知道只有毛主席的队伍才有勇气和毅力担负并征服这一切苦难，把他们从苦难中拯救出来。
    八月五日深夜，当人民解放军和平进入长沙的时候，长沙人民的狂热是难以形容的。虽然那天有蒋匪飞机轰炸的威胁，但知道了解放军就要进城以后，连散在四乡的人们也赶进城来了。那一天，长沙市上的鞭炮和红绿色的纸张被抢购一空，鲜花水果在市场上成了稀有的珍品。狂热的人群从六点钟等起，一直等到下午十一点，热情越来越高涨，因为不时有人传说：“来了来了。”所以等到真的来了时，全城的鞭炮差不多都已经放光，鞭炮铺子里的存货也大都空空如也了。工人的欢迎卡车从早晨便已驶到浏阳河的东屯渡口，学生的歌声一直没有停止过。十一时，当解放军的宣传卡车作为先头部队从东屯渡驶入长沙时，不仅来不及作什么宣传，连几句感谢的话都说不成。青年学生们一拥而上，握手拥抱，开始还有些雄壮的口号声，“欢迎人民解放军！”“毛主席万岁！”后来便只剩下了“万岁！”，最后连“万岁！”也来不及喊，并且也觉得不够力量了，震天响着的是一片汪洋浩荡的欢乐的呼喊。战士们身上被插满了鲜花，口袋里不知什么时候被多少只手塞进了多少东西，饼干、香烟和鲜花从四面八方扔进了卡车，战士们企图扔还给欢迎的人们，但更多的又抛进来了。有些女学生只是向战士们伸着手，而红红的脸上热泪不禁夺眶而出。著名的学者黄芝冈老先生说：马日事变以来，在那些黑暗的日子里，虽然他曾目击过多少革命青年被绑出去杀了，而他咬着牙忍着，他没有泪；但八月五号，当他看到红着脸、流着汗雄壮的人民解放军战士们卷入在这个狂欢的海洋时，他哭了，咽不成声了！毛主席的战士回来了！人民自己有了自己的兵了！黑暗已经到了尽头，一个新的人民民主国家起来了！
    在平江，一个老太太曾夸示彭德怀将军曾住过她的家，她的家当时是彭德怀将军的司令部。他的两个儿子都参加红军走了。她问：“他们现在在那儿？”一个青年农民曾象接待自己亲人似地自然而熟识地接待解放军战士。他说，他没见过父亲，在母亲还在怀孕的时候，父亲就参加红军走了。他问：“他会不会回来？”他们都会回来的，她的儿子和他的父亲也许不会回来了，但他们的理想和事业却真真实实的回来了！她的儿子和她的父亲在共产党领导下英勇无畏地创造了新的人民民主国家，这个国家来了！为了不给这个国家的残敌以任何喘息的机会，人民解放军排除万难，越过长沙，继续前进着！
