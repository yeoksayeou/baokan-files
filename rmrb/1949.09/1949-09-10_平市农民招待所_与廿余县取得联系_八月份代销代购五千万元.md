　　Ping City Farmers' Hostel
  　Establishes Contact with Over Twenty Counties
    Sales and Purchases Totaling 50 Million Yuan in August
    [This City News] In order to connect urban and rural trade and promote the exchange of materials, the Beijing Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative established the Farmers' Hostel (formerly the site of Shoushan First Building) on Langfang Toutiao, Qianmenwai, on April 18. Since its opening, it has been well received by farmers and has established business relationships with cooperatives and farmers in over twenty counties, including Miyun, Huairou, Sihai, Longguan, Shacheng, Datong, Yingxian, Zhuoxian, Dingxing, Xincheng, Gu'an, Qingyuan, Tangxian, Xingtang, Fangshan, Daxing, Wanping, etc., purchasing and selling on their behalf according to the needs of each region. In four months, a total of 5,990 farmers have visited. Goods sold on behalf of farmers and county cooperatives in August, mainly millet, sorghum, wheat, almonds, cotton, silk, and copper, totaled more than 41.74 million yuan. Goods purchased on their behalf, mainly sea salt, fertilizer, and kerosene, totaled more than 10.7 million yuan. Currently, the most common mountain products arriving are walnuts and chestnuts. The hostel also provides various conveniences for farmers coming to Ping City, and the accommodation is very cheap, with daily room rates of 300 yuan and 240 yuan respectively, and meal costs of 180 yuan per meal. However, the business of the Farmers' Hostel has not developed better because rural cooperatives in various parts of North China have not yet been universally established, the business relationship with the established county and village cooperatives is not yet close enough, the situation in various places is not yet well understood, and the business division with trading companies still needs to be specific (such as both units selling and purchasing mountain products). The Cooperative is currently studying the operating direction of the hostel in detail, so as to better help farmers sell agricultural products, order farm tools and necessities, and provide farmers with a place to rest and receive living care when they come to the city.

　　平市农民招待所
  　与廿余县取得联系
    八月份代销代购五千万元
    【本市讯】北平市供销合作总社，为了沟通城乡贸易，促进物资交流，于四月十八日在前外廊房头条建立了农民招待所（原首善第一楼旧址）。开业以来，备受农民欢迎，已和密云、怀柔、四海、龙关、沙城、大同、应县、涿县、定兴、新城、固安、清苑、唐县、行唐、房山、大兴、宛平等二十余县合作社、农民建立了业务关系，按照各地需要代购代销。来往农民四个月中共达五千九百九十人。为农民、县合作社代销的货物，八月份以小米、红粮、小麦、杏仁、棉花、蚕丝、铜为大宗，总计四千一百七十四万余元。代购的货物以海盐、肥料、煤油为大宗，总计一千零七十余万元。目前各地山货，如核桃、栗子等来的最多。该所并给予各地来平的农民以种种的方便，所中食宿也很便宜，每日房租分三百元、二百四十元两种，饭金每顿一百八十元。但是，农民招待所的业务，由于华北各地农村合作社尚未普遍建立起来，与已建立的县、村合作社业务关系联系得还不密切，各地情况掌握得还不够，与贸易公司业务亦有待具体分工（如两单位都在代销代购山货等），以致未能更好发展。合作总社目前正详密研究该所的经营方向，以便更好的帮助农民出售农产品，订购农具和必需品，并使农民进城有歇脚的地方，得到生活上的照顾。
