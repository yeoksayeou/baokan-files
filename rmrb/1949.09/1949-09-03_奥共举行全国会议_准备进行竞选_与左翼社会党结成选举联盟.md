Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 2nd - TASS Vienna dispatch: The Austrian Communist Party held a national conference on August 27th and 28th in Vienna's "Musikverein," with over two thousand representatives from various provinces participating. The venue was filled with flags of various colors. A large red flag with portraits of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin hung on the podium. The presidium was composed of Austrian Communist Party leaders such as Koplenig, Fürnberg, Honner, and Fischer.

　　National Councilor Honner announced the opening of the conference, stating: The task of the conference is to determine the basic principles of the Communist Party's activities during the preparation period for the general election to be held on October 9th. Austrian Communist Party Chairman Koplenig delivered a report on "The Communist Party and the Left-Wing Socialist Party's Election Struggle," detailing the current political situation in Austria, analyzing the government coalition's policies over the past four years, and putting forward to party organizations specific tasks to ensure the victory of the electoral alliance between the Communist Party and the Progressive Socialists (i.e., the Left-Wing Socialist Party) in the election.

　　Growth of Working-Class Strength, Conference Filled with Confidence in Victory

　　Twenty-five representatives spoke during the discussion of the report. Speakers unanimously emphasized that the establishment of the joint election alliance between the Communist Party and the Left-Wing Socialist Party has received enthusiastic support from the working masses across the country. The establishment of the Left-Wing Alliance has stimulated the political activism of the working masses. Speakers cited many examples proving that the broad masses of workers and staff in Austria are increasingly aware of the treacherous policies jointly pursued by the right-wing leaders of the Austrian Socialist Party and the reactionary "People's" Party. Rank-and-file members of the Socialist Party are leaving the party in droves and joining the Progressive Socialists or the Communist Party. This movement exists in many cities and provinces. The speakers were filled with firm confidence that the alliance between the Communist Party and the Left-Wing Socialist Party would achieve a significant victory in the upcoming Austrian parliamentary elections.

　　The conference approved the joint candidate list of the Communist Party and the Progressive Socialists for the parliamentary elections. At the meeting on the 27th, it was decided to invite a delegation from the Progressive Socialists to participate in the conference. When the delegation of the Left-Wing Socialist Party, headed by Schärf, appeared in the conference hall, the conference representatives responded with prolonged applause and cheers, shouting, "Long live the unity of the working class!" "Welcome the alliance of the Communist Party and the Left-Wing Socialist Party!" and singing the Internationale.

　　In his address to the conference, Schärf pointed out that the Left-Wing Socialist Party had traveled a long road before forming an electoral alliance with the Communist Party, firmly believing in the necessity of the unity of the working-class forces.

　　The conference concluded with a speech by Honner, who emphasized that never in the history of the Austrian communist movement has there been a conference that so powerfully demonstrated the strength and unity of the Communist Party and its determination to achieve victory as this conference.

　　奥共举行全国会议
  　准备进行竞选
  　与左翼社会党结成选举联盟
    【新华社北平二日电】据塔斯社维也纳讯：奥地利共产党全国代表会议于八月二十七、八两日在维也纳“音乐厅”举行，有来自各省的两千余名代表参加。会场满布各色旗帜。讲台上挂着上有马恩列斯像的大幅红旗。柯普利尼希、费恩伯、昂纳、费希尔等奥共领袖组成主席团。
    国会议员昂纳宣布大会揭幕，他说：会议的任务是决定于十月九日举行的大选准备期间共产党活动的基本原则。奥共主席柯普利尼希作了“共产党和左翼社会党竞选斗争”的报告，详述目前奥国的政治形势，分析了政府联盟在最近四年中的政策，并向党组织提出了为使共产党与进步社会党人联盟（按即左翼社会党）的选举联盟在竞选中取得胜利的具体任务。
    工人阶级力量增长大会充满胜利信心
    在讨论该报告时有二十五个代表发言。发言者一致强调：共产党与左翼社会党联合竞选联盟的创立，获得全国劳动群众的热烈支持。左翼联盟的建立激发了劳动群众的政治积极性。发言人们引很多例子证明奥国广大职工群众日益认识到奥国社会党右翼领袖与反动的“人民”党所共同奉行的叛卖政策。社会党下层党员成批地退出该党，而参加进步社会党人联盟或共产党。不少城市和省分中都有这种运动。发言者充满着对共产党与左翼社会党联盟在即将到来的奥国国会选举中获得重大胜利的坚定信心。
    会议批准了议会选举中共产党与进步社会党人的联合候选名单。二十七日会上决定邀请进步社会党人联盟的代表团参加会议。当以夏尔夫为首的左翼社会党代表团在会议厅中出现时，会议代表报以长久的鼓掌和欢呼，全场高呼：“工人阶级的统一万岁！”“欢迎共产党和左翼社会党的联盟！”并高唱国际歌。
    夏尔夫在向大会致辞中指出：左翼社会党在与共产党结成选举联盟以前，曾走过漫长的道路，深信工人阶级力量团结的必要。
    会议最后由昂纳发表演说，他着重指出：澳地利共产主义运动的历史上，从来没有过一次会议象这次会议这样强有力地显示了共产党的力量和团结以及获得胜利的决心。
