　　Maintain a Hundredfold Vigilance Against Autumn Floods!
  　The Yellow River's Water Rises, Critical Embankments are in Danger
  　Cadres and Masses in Pingyuan Province are Making Every Effort to Combat the Disaster
    [Xinxiang Electric Dispatch] In recent days, continuous rain has fallen in the upper reaches of the Yellow River in Pingyuan Province, causing the river's water level to rise continuously. The water level at various locations has reached the second flood level of this year (the highest water level this year at Gaocun Critical Embankment in Dongming was 66.16 meters), and in some individual places it has even exceeded this level, causing tension throughout the entire line, with several critical embankments in danger. According to the water level on the 12th, at the Guantai Critical Embankment, from 12:00 midnight on the 10th to the night of the 12th, the water level was three *cun* higher than the second highest water level. At Gaocun, the water level at 18:00 on the 12th was one *cun* higher, and at Shouzhang it also exceeded the second flood level. At the Second and Fourth Repair Sections, the water level was equal to the second flood level. Under these circumstances, along the river line, the revetments of the Zhukou and Liuzhuang Eighth Sections were being eroded by the main current, and the 28th and 16th dikes were sinking. At the Juancheng Critical Embankment, under the direct impact of the main current, the 11th and 19th dikes were sinking. At Wangzhuang, Doufuyu, and Xidaokou Critical Embankments in Qihe, the dikes collapsed under the erosion of the main current. At the Nanxiaoda Critical Embankment, the 7th, 8th, and 9th dikes were facing the main current, and the dikes were slightly sinking. In addition, a section of the main dike about 2,000 meters long between Yuncheng and Liangshan was being eroded. At the Sunkou Critical Embankment, the main current was already impacting, the second and third straw dikes were level with the water, and the new fourth and fifth embankments were submerged. The current situation is very serious. The Pingyuan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Provincial Government have successively issued instructions, ordering responsible cadres at all levels to immediately go to the dikes to defend them. Wang Huayun, Director of the Yellow River Commission, personally went to Gaocun and other places on the 13th to supervise and lead the work, and arranged for one million *jin* of straw to be prepared for emergency use. It is currently being transported. The responsible party and government cadres in various places have mostly arrived on the dikes to provide guidance. Each repair section has also transferred a batch of temporary flood control personnel to the dikes according to the needs of the situation. The flood fighting reserve teams in the villages along the river are also actively preparing. The district cadres in the areas along the river are mobilizing the masses to prepare straw and other materials to ensure the supply of manpower and materials for flood control and disaster relief. The masses in the river滩 are being educated and persuaded to remove the civil dikes that obstruct the flow of water. At present, flood control work has entered a tense stage. This rise in water level is due to continuous rain in the upper reaches of the Yellow River in Shanxi, Gansu, and Shaanxi. The water in the tributaries has risen and flowed into the Yellow River. Therefore, the duration is longer than that of a mountain flash flood. Furthermore, Pingyuan Province is also experiencing continuous autumn rain, and the dikes are being soaked both inside and out. If the high water level reaches Shanzhou on the 12th, it will be more serious than the previous flood.
    [Xinxiang Electric Dispatch] According to a report from the Shanzhou Hydrological Station: At 20:00 on the 12th, the water level at Shanzhou rose to 296.88 meters, with a flow rate of 12,000 cubic meters per second. By 9:00 on the 13th, the water level had dropped to 296.48 meters, with a flow rate of 10,000 cubic meters per second. Although there was a slight decrease compared to the previous two days, the rainfall from 0:40 to 9:00 on the 13th reached 340 millimeters, and it is feared that it will continue to rise.

### 百倍警惕秋汛！　黄河水涨险工告急　平原省干部群众全力抢险

　　百倍警惕秋汛！
  　黄河水涨险工告急
  　平原省干部群众全力抢险
    【新乡电】黄河上游近日霪雨连绵，平原省黄河水势上涨不已，各处水位已达今年第二次洪水水位（本年最高水位在东明高村险工为六六点一六公尺），个别地方且已超过，因而全线吃紧，数处险工告急。根据十二日水位，贯台险工处，自十日夜十二时至十二日夜，水位高于第二次最高水位三公寸，高村十二日十八时水位高出一公寸，寿张亦高出二次洪水位，在二、四修防处则与第二次洪水位相等。在此情况下，沿河线朱口、刘庄八段护沿着大溜，二十八、十六坝下蛰。鄄城险工在大溜顶冲下，十一、十九坝埽下蛰。齐河王庄、豆腐禹、西道口等险工，在大溜冲刷下，坝埽坍塌。南小大险工之七、八、九等坝着大溜，坝埽略有下蛰。另有郓城与梁山中间一段，大堤被冲刷约两千公尺长的一段，孙口险工已着大溜，二、三秸埽已与水平，新四、五埝已入水，目前情况已十分严重。中共平原省委、省府连续发出指示，命令各级政府负责干部立即上堤防守。黄委会主任王化云，已于十三日亲赴高村等地亲自督促领导，并布置秸料百万斤，以备急用。现正赶运中。各地党政负责干部，绝大部分已到堤上指导，各修防段又根据情况的需要，抽调一批临时防汛员上堤。沿河村中之抢险预备队，亦积极准备，沿河各区区干部，正动员群众预备秸料等，保证防汛抢险中人力物力之供给。对河滩里的群众，则教育说服拆去有阻水凸之民埝。目前防汛工作已进入紧张阶段。此次涨水系因山西、甘肃、陕西黄河上游连日霪雨，各支流河水上涨后灌入黄河，因此比山区爆发时间要长，再者平原省同时连日秋雨，大堤里外遭受水浸，如陕州十二日高水位到达，则会比上次洪水更加严重。
    【新乡电】据陕州水文站报告：陕州于十二日二十时，水位涨至二九六点八八公尺，流量达一万二千秒立方公尺。至十三日九时水位降为二九六点四八公尺，流量为一万秒立方公尺，两日比较虽微有下降，但在十三日零时四十分至九时，落雨量达三百四十公厘，恐继续上涨。
