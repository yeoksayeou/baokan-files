　　Congratulations on the People's Victory
　　Guang Weiran

　　The People's Political Consultative Conference has opened, and the New China is born!

　　Chairman Mao, with the voice of a giant, announced to the world: "The Chinese, who account for a quarter of the world's population, have stood up from now on."

　　Our radio station is busy broadcasting the cheers of the people across the country from the air; at the same time, it is rebroadcasting the cheers of people all over the world.

　　More than two thousand years of feudal rule has come to an end; more than one hundred years of imperialist aggression has collapsed; and more than twenty years of Chiang Kai-shek bandit's bloody rule has been declared extinct.

　　The iron tree has blossomed. The New China is like a red sun rising from the sea, radiating thousands of rays of light.

　　It's really not easy. What arduous and huge project this is! How many heroic people have shed their heads for this. They sang heroically under the enemy's butcher knife; countless people's soldiers, under the call of a great ideal, fought one after another, bleeding and sacrificing on the battlefield. They created victory, but today they cannot share the joy of victory with us....

　　"Eternal glory to the people's heroes who sacrificed in the People's Liberation War and the People's Revolution!"

　　We must cherish the fruits of our hard work. We must love our people's cause and the people's new country. We must firmly grasp the weapon of the people's democratic dictatorship, so that we are not afraid of the ghostly shadows of the domestic reactionary remnants. We must closely unite with our allied country, the Soviet Union, and all international friends, so that we are not afraid of the devil's hand secretly stretched out from across the Pacific.

　　A message to the likes of Truman and Acheson: Don't waste your efforts there; your paper tiger has been exposed, you have appeared very incompetent in front of the Chinese people, and your White Paper has educated our masses to be smarter.

　　The people's ranks are unprecedentedly broad and strong, and they will completely block every path of domestic and foreign reactionaries; and what about us? Every road leads to victory and glory!

　　Independence, democracy, peace, unity, and prosperity. These beautiful concepts are no longer mere concepts and slogans for us; for us, they have become, or are becoming, tangible and living new things. -- New things that we have long dreamed of that have never appeared in Chinese history!

　　Our party, the vanguard of the proletariat, the organizer and catalyst of victory and glory! Our brave and hardworking people, once they receive your leadership, will be a hundred times wiser and braver, creating human miracles and creating new things that have never appeared in history!

　　Great leader, mentor, helmsman, Comrade Mao Zedong! Whenever we mention your name, we feel honor and pride, and we gain courage and strength. It is completely understandable that the people regard you as a savior. Because of your guidance, the course of Chinese history has been shortened, and the experience of pain and disaster has been shortened; because of your guidance, we have made fewer mistakes, taken fewer detours, and sacrificed fewer comrades, so we can take a step forward, open the iron gate of the Chinese prison, rescue the masses, comrades, and ourselves, and liberate hundreds of millions of prisoners awaiting trial.

　　As long as victory is brought forward by one minute, many lives will be saved; and you taught us to bring victory forward by several years!

　　Just calculate: because of you, how many years has the course of history been shortened, and you can know how many years the life expectancy of the Chinese people has been generally extended because of you.

　　We are overjoyed: in the coming years, in the era when we are alive and working, we actually have the opportunity to follow you and all the people to steadily move towards socialism! We never dared to dream of this in the dark and difficult years twenty years ago.

　　Dear Comrade Mao Zedong, you taught the Chinese people how to turn dreams into reality!

　　Disaster and humiliation have become a thing of the past, and now we proudly live in a new democratic society, living in the era of Mao Zedong. For the first time since the beginning of the world, we have our own people's country. Great ideals inspire us, brilliant prospects attract us, and the eyes of the world are watching us. Workers, peasants, soldiers, intellectuals! Let's give full play to the labor and creativity of each of us! Don't waste a minute.

　　The People's Democratic United Front is unprecedentedly great and strong. All democratic parties, all circles, and all ethnic groups are united under the leadership of the Communist Party, like spokes converging on a hub: the wheels of new history are moving forward!

　　Under the banner of Mao Zedong, hundreds of millions of people have formed a team. This is an endless team, this is an organized and disciplined team, this is a large army for production and construction, this is a large army for defending peace, and this is a large army for creating wisdom, culture, and human happiness.

　　This is an unstoppable force, this is the hope of all oppressed nations in the East.

　　"We have difficulties ahead, and there are many of them, but we are convinced that all difficulties will be overcome by the heroic struggle of the people of the whole country."

　　The Long March has taken the first step, and happiness and fulfillment are ahead!
　　(September 23)

　　祝贺人民的胜利
    光未然
    人民政协会议开幕了，新中国诞生了！
    毛主席以巨人的声音昭告全世界：“占人类总数四分之一的中国人从此站立起来了。”
    我们的无线电台，正忙着把全国人民的欢呼从空中播送出去；同时把全世界人民的欢呼转播过来。
    两千多年来的封建统治从此结束；一百多年来的帝国主义侵略势力从此垮台；二十多年来的蒋匪血腥统治从此宣告灭亡。
    铁树开了花。新中国如红日出海，放射出万道霞光。
    真不容易啊，这是多么艰苦巨大的工程！多少英雄志士为此抛掉头颅，他们在敌人的屠刀下高歌就义；无数的人民战士，在一个伟大理想的号召下，前仆后继，战场上流血牺牲。他们创造了胜利，而今天却不能和我们共享胜利的狂欢……。
    “在人民解放战争和人民革命中牺牲的人民英雄们永垂不朽！”
    要好好宝爱我们血汗换来的成果。要热爱我们的人民事业和人民的新国家。要牢牢地掌握人民民主专政的武器，这样就不怕国内反动残余的鬼影幢幢。要紧紧地联合盟邦苏联及一切国际朋友，这样就不怕从太平洋彼岸偷偷伸过来的魔手。
    寄语杜鲁门、艾奇逊之流：你们不要在那里枉费心机；你们的纸老虎已经被戳穿，你们在中国人民的面前已经显得十分低能，你们的白皮书已经把我们的群众教育得更聪明了。
    人民的队伍空前的广大强壮，就要把国内外反动派的每一条路子完全堵死；而我们呢？条条大路通到胜利与光荣！
    独立、民主、和平、统一、富强。这些美好的概念，对于我们，已经不是单纯的概念和口号；对于我们，已经变成或正在变成可以触摸的活生生的新事物了。——我们长久梦想着的，在中国历史上从未出现过的新事物！
    我们的党，无产阶级的先锋队，胜利与光荣的组织者与催生者！我们勇敢勤劳的人民，一得到你的领导，就会智勇百倍，创造人类的奇迹，创造历史上从未出现过的新事物！
    伟大的领袖、导师、舵手毛泽东同志！我们一提到你的名字，就感到光荣和骄傲，就得到勇气和力量。人民把你看做救星，那是完全可以理解的。由于你的指引，缩短了中国历史的进程，缩短了痛苦和灾难的经历；由于你的指引，我们少犯了多少错误，少走了多少弯路，少牺牲了多少同志，得以抢前一步，打开中华大监狱的铁门，救出群众、同志和自己，使亿万待决之囚得到解放。
    只要把胜利提早一分钟，就会抢救出多少活命；而你教导我们，把胜利提早了若干年！
    只要算一算：因你之故，历史的进程缩短了多少年，就可以知道，由于你，中国人民的寿命普遍延长了多少年。
    我们喜出望外：在未来的若干年后，我们活着还工作着的年代，竟然有机会跟着你和全体人民，一同稳步走向社会主义！这在二十年前，漆黑难熬的岁月里，我们从不敢这样梦想的。
    亲爱的毛泽东同志，你教导中国人民学会怎样把梦想变成现实！
    灾难和羞辱已成为过去，如今我们骄傲地生活在新民主主义社会，生活在毛泽东的年代。开天辟地以来，我们第一次有了人民自己的国家。伟大的理想鼓舞着我们，光辉的远景吸引着我们，全世界的眼睛望着我们。工人们、农民们、士兵们、知识分子们！把我们每一个人的劳动创造力尽情地发挥出来吧！一分钟也不要浪费。
    人民民主统一战线空前地伟大坚强。各民主党派、各界、各族人民团结在共产党的领导下，象车辐辏集在车毂：新历史的车轮向前进！
    在毛泽东的旗帜下，数亿人民结成队伍。这是无穷无尽的队伍，这是有组织有纪律的队伍，这是生产建设的大军，这是保卫和平的大军，这是创造智慧、文化与人类幸福的大军。
    这是不可阻挡的力量，这是东方一切被压迫民族的指望。
    “我们前面的困难是有的，而且是很多的，但是我们确信：一切困难都将被全国人民的英勇奋斗所战胜。”
    万里长征开走步，幸福美满在前头！
   （九月二十三日）
