　　On the Characteristics of Soviet Foreign Policy
 　　Foreign policy is determined by the economic system
 　　Ke Bonian
　　A country's foreign policy is, in the final analysis, determined by its economic system. The foreign policy of an imperialist country, regardless of which political party is in power, whether it is the Democratic or Republican Party (as in the United States), the Conservative, Liberal, or Labour Party (as in Britain), as long as its capital imperialist system continues to exist, it will inevitably be a policy of safeguarding the interests of its own monopoly capital and financial capital, it will inevitably be a policy of expansion, a policy of aggression, a policy of dividing the world, and a policy of war. The methods and means used to implement this policy may vary, but its essence remains unchanged. Conversely, the Soviet Union's economic system is socialist, and its foreign policy can only be a policy of maintaining international peace, a policy of protecting the sovereignty and equality of all small and weak nations.

　　In socialist Soviet Union, the system of exploitation of man by man has been abolished. Production is not for the profits of a few, but for the lives of all the people; it is not a state of anarchy, but a planned economy. The increase in productivity means an increase in the living standards of all the people and a shortening of working hours. There will be no relative overproduction, no economic panic, no unemployment, and no capital surplus. The infinite increase in productivity is a necessary prerequisite for realizing communism, "from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs." Although the Soviet Union also trades with foreign countries, it is exchanging what it has for what it lacks; it is mutual assistance, not aggression.

　　Socialist Soviet Union will never seek foreign markets for its relatively surplus commodities in order to avoid economic panic, and will never seek foreign investment places for its surplus capital, so it will never invade other countries or fight for colonies in order to monopolize foreign markets or protect the security of foreign investments.

　　The essence of socialism is anti-aggression. Socialism, without class exploitation or class oppression at home, cannot have national exploitation or national oppression abroad.

　　The foreign policy of socialist Soviet Union proceeds from the interests of the entire two hundred million people of the Soviet Union, and the interests of the Soviet people are fundamentally consistent with the interests of the working people of the whole world. Precisely for this reason, the Soviet Union has become a fervent advocate of the true interests of the working people of the whole world, and the working people of the whole world firmly support the Soviet Union's foreign policy.

　　Oppose national oppression, advocate national self-determination
　　The most important characteristic of Soviet foreign policy is to oppose national oppression and advocate national self-determination; to oppose narrow nationalism and advocate genuine internationalism; to actively help the national liberation movements of small and weak nations and safeguard their interests.

　　The exploitation of other nations strengthens the position of the ruling class in its own country. Therefore, the nation that oppresses other nations cannot liberate itself. Helping the liberation of other oppressed and exploited nations weakens the strength of the ruling class in its own country, thereby facilitating the proletariat to rise up and overthrow it. Therefore, the proletariat's support for the liberation of oppressed and exploited nations is not an abstract issue of justice or human sympathy, but the first condition for their own social liberation.

　　After the victory of the revolution, the Russian proletariat immediately recognized the right to national self-determination and issued the "Declaration of Rights of the Peoples of Russia" drafted by Comrade Stalin, which stipulated the free development of all nationalities in Russia and the complete equality of rights of all nationalities as law.

　　"The right to self-determination means that a nation can establish a state according to its own wishes. It has the right to establish its domestic life on the basis of autonomy, and it has the right to establish federal relations with other nations. It has the complete right to separation. Every nation is a sovereign state, and all nations are equal," Stalin said.

　　Why recognize the right to national self-determination up to the freedom of separation and independence? Lenin said: "National resentment will not disappear quickly: the resentment of the oppressed nation towards the oppressor nation—this resentment is very justified—will continue to exist for a period of time; it will only disappear after the victory of socialism, only after the final establishment of completely democratic relations between all nations. If we want to be faithful to socialism, we must now carry out the internationalist education of the masses, but to carry out this education in the oppressor nation, it is impossible without advocating the freedom of separation for the oppressed nation."

　　Therefore, after the success of the Russian socialist revolution, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, etc. successively gained independence. The Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic is "built on the basis of the free union of all free nations, and is a federation of various Soviet national republics." (Declaration of the Rights of the Working and Exploited People)

　　In December 1922, all the Soviet republics within Russia united into a unified Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on the principle of voluntariness and equality, while each republic retained the right to freely withdraw from the Soviet Union.

　　The victorious proletarian regime of the Soviet Union, based on the Leninist-Marxist principle of national self-determination, thoroughly abolished the past Tsarist era's policies of oppression and exploitation of small and weak nations within the country, solved the domestic national problem, and set an example of democratic and equal cooperation among all nations.

　　Aid the liberation movement of small and weak nations
　　The Soviet Union does everything possible to help all the oppressed nations in colonial and semi-colonial countries to get rid of the national liberation movement of imperialist oppression, speaks out for their sovereignty at all international conferences, and unswervingly maintains their interests.

　　In the era of imperialism, all national liberation movements in colonial and semi-colonial countries are part of the world proletarian revolution. Comrade Stalin said in his book "On the Foundations of Leninism": "Leninism has proved, and the imperialist war and the Russian revolution have already proved: the national question can only be resolved in connection with the proletarian revolution and on the basis of the proletarian revolution, and the Western revolution must form a revolutionary alliance with the anti-imperialist liberation movement of the colonies and dependent countries in order to win victory. The national question is part of the general problem of the proletarian revolution, part of the problem of the proletariat seizing power." "Leninism...believes that the national liberation movement in the oppressed countries contains revolutionary capabilities, and believes that these revolutionary capabilities can be used to strive to overthrow the common enemy, to strive to overthrow imperialism." "From this, it can be seen that the proletariat must help, must resolutely and actively help the national liberation movement of all oppressed nations and dependent nations."

　　After the victory of the October Revolution, the Soviet government immediately announced the abolition of the secret agreements concluded by the past Tsarist government and other imperialist countries regarding the partition of Persia and the partition of Turkey, and announced the abandonment of Russia's special interests in China, Persia, and other countries. In 1921, equal treaties of friendship were signed with Persia, Turkey, and Afghanistan one after another. In 1924, a new equal treaty was concluded with China, abolishing the unequal treaties of the past. Not only that, it also resolutely and actively did everything possible to help Turkey's national liberation movement and help China's National Revolution (the First Great Revolution of 1925-27).

　　After the Soviet Union joined the League of Nations, it resolutely opposed Italy's aggression against Abyssinia at the League of Nations meetings and thoroughly implemented economic sanctions against Italy; it resolutely opposed Germany and Italy's support for the Franco rebels and did everything possible to aid the Spanish Republican government; it resolutely opposed Nazi Germany's infringement of Czechoslovakia's independent existence and criticized the Munich Conference's betrayal of Czechoslovakia.

　　After the Second World War, the Soviet Union firmly advocated at the United Nations meetings that the purpose of the trusteeship system was to enable the trusteed nations to obtain complete independence; it firmly opposed the United States and Britain's aid to the Greek reactionary government in attacking the Greek democratic forces; it firmly opposed the US imperialists' establishment of a reactionary puppet government in South Korea, splitting Korea; it firmly maintained the national liberation movement of Indonesia, opposed US imperialism's aid to the Netherlands in carrying out colonial wars; it firmly opposed South Africa's discrimination against Indians.

　　For the defeated countries, the Soviet Union only advocated that they must be thoroughly demilitarized and democratized so that they would no longer endanger world peace and no longer be able to infringe upon neighboring countries; at the same time, the Soviet Union insisted that their people have the right to choose their government.

　　Since its founding, the Soviet Union has always been the maintainer of the sovereignty and independence of small and weak nations, has always been an active helper of their national liberation movements, and has always been their only reliable and true friend.

　　Maintain democratic peace, oppose aggressive war
　　Another major characteristic of Soviet foreign policy is to strive to maintain world peace—democratic peace, lasting peace.

　　The Soviet Union's peace policy was not a temporary expedient policy when it had just succeeded in the socialist revolution and was being subjected to armed intervention by fourteen countries and surrounded by imperialism when it was relatively weak, but its consistent national policy. After the Second World War, it has become one of the most powerful countries in the world, and its foreign policy is still a peace policy. The Soviet Union's peace policy is not a temporary transitional phenomenon, but a consistent national policy, because it arises from the basic interests and practical needs of the Soviet people.

　　Because the essence of socialism is anti-aggression, anti-national oppression, and anti-national exploitation, the Soviet Union opposes all aggressive wars for re-dividing the world.

　　Because the broad masses of working people suffer the most in war, the fighting troops are mainly composed of working people, and the war expenses are mainly borne by the working people; the bourgeoisie makes a fortune from war. For example, the profits of US companies (after taxes) were 15.3 billion US dollars in the five years before the war (1935-39), and increased to 42.3 billion US dollars in the five years during the war (1940-44), which is about three times that before the war. Therefore, there are a large number of politicians in imperialist countries who are engaged in instigating war, wholeheartedly undermining world peace. The Soviet Union not only represents the interests of the Soviet people, but also represents the interests of the broad masses of working people all over the world, unswervingly maintaining peace and opposing war.

　　Because Marxists-Leninists have always opposed all theories related to "exporting revolution," Engels once clearly pointed out that "the victorious proletariat cannot forcibly give any kind of happiness to any foreign country, and if it does so, it will inevitably bury its own victory." Therefore, when the proletariat in Russia has achieved revolutionary victory and the proletarian revolution in other countries has not yet matured, there will inevitably be a period of coexistence of socialist and capitalist countries. It is possible for countries with two different systems to cooperate. Comrade Stalin said in a conversation with US Stassen in 1947: "These two economic systems can certainly cooperate with each other. Germany and the United States have the same economic system, but war broke out between the two countries. The United States and the Soviet Union do not have the same economic system, but the two countries did not go to war and cooperated during the war. If two different systems can cooperate during the war, then why can't they cooperate in peacetime? Of course, it is very clear that if they are willing, cooperation is entirely possible even if the economic systems are different." "Lenin was the first to express that the two systems could cooperate. Lenin is our teacher, and we Soviet people are Lenin's students." "Cooperation between the two systems is possible and promising. At the same time, as far as the people and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union are concerned, they are sincere in cooperating. There is no doubt that this cooperation will be beneficial to both countries." Comrade Stalin said in a letter to Wallace in 1948: "The Soviet government believes that despite the differences in economic systems and ideology, the coexistence of these systems and the peaceful resolution of differences between the Soviet Union and the United States are not only possible, but also absolutely necessary for the sake of universal peace." It can be seen that socialist Soviet Union, because it believes that the coexistence and cooperation of socialism and capitalism is possible and promising, strives for cooperation to maintain peace.

　　Because Marxists-Leninists believe that it is possible to build a socialist economy in one country in the Soviet Union, and socialist construction requires peace. Therefore, the Soviet Union has always strived for peace in order to concentrate on socialist construction, improve productivity, increase the happiness of all the people, and transition from socialism to communism as soon as possible.

　　From this, it can be seen that the Soviet Union's foreign policy is a peace policy, and it can only be a peace policy.

　　The sovereign equality of all nations is a condition for democratic peace
　　The peace advocated by the Soviet Union is a democratic and equal peace, not a slave peace in which some countries dominate other countries, not a peace between the rider and the ridden.

　　Comrade Stalin said: "Every nation supports the system that they are willing and able to support. Which system is better—let history prove it. The system chosen and supported by the people should be respected. Whether the American system is good or bad—that is a matter for the American people. For the sake of cooperation, it is not necessary to require all nations to have the same system. The system supported by the people should be respected. Only under this condition is cooperation possible."

　　Recognizing that every nation has the right to choose its own system, the Soviet Union does not interfere in the internal affairs of the United States, and the United States cannot interfere in the internal affairs of the Soviet Union. The sovereign equality of all nations is a prerequisite for democratic peace between nations; this is the principle of international relations that the Soviet Union has consistently adhered to.

　　Molotov said: "In international life, there are two directly opposite methods, one is the method of oppression and domination, for which all means of oppression are right; the other is (not yet very popular) the method of democratic cooperation based on the principles of equality and legitimate interests of all countries, no matter how big or small." The former is the method practiced by imperialist countries, and the latter is the method practiced by the Soviet Union.

　　Hills, a reporter for the British Sunday Times, asked Comrade Stalin: "Is there a possibility for friendly and long-term cooperation between the Soviet Union and the Western democracies, despite ideological differences? Do you believe in the friendship competition between the two systems mentioned in Wallace's speech?" Comrade Stalin replied: "Absolutely believe." Because the Soviet Union has absolute confidence in the superiority of the socialist system and firmly believes that the socialist system will inevitably prevail over the capitalist system in peaceful competition, it unswervingly adheres to peace, adheres to cooperation, adheres to competition, and adheres to the freedom of the people of all countries to choose their own systems. Conversely, the ruling class of imperialist countries has lost confidence in the future of the capitalist system in competition with the socialist system, so they fear competition and are constantly trying to eliminate socialist Soviet Union and carry out all kinds of anti-Soviet conspiracies.

　　Imperialist countries adopt a policy of instigating war, a hostile encirclement policy, and a policy of interference towards the Soviet Union. They have no sincerity in cooperating with the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union's policy, Comrade Stalin said, is "still willing to increase political and economic relations with all countries (with the United States and Britain at the head). If those countries are willing to increase relations with the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union will rush to meet them regardless of the differences in political and social systems. Because experience has proved that it is entirely possible for countries with different political and social systems to cooperate with each other. On the other hand, if those countries are currently unwilling to increase relations with the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union will implement a firm policy in the absence of cooperation, until they are sober-minded and recognize the necessity of international cooperation in the current world. We are patient people."

　　However, if the war provocateurs of imperialist countries disregard the Soviet Union's patient efforts to strive for democratic peace and international cooperation and dare to launch a war against the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union will resolutely strike the aggressors. Lenin said: "Adhering to the will of the workers and peasants who need peace, the government of the Soviet Republic never forgets that there is a limit, beyond which even the most peace-loving working masses will be forced to rise up unanimously and defend their country with armed hands." In order to fulfill its obligations under international treaties, the Soviet Union will also be forced to use force to deal with the aggressors who undermine world peace.

　　Persevere and strive for peace
　　Since the success of the October Revolution, the Soviet Union has unswervingly pursued a policy of peace and strived for democratic peace in the world.

　　As soon as the socialist revolution succeeded, the Soviet government immediately announced the Decree on Peace, proposing to the people and governments of all belligerent countries to immediately conclude a truce agreement of at least three months in order to conduct negotiations on a just and democratic peace. At the same time, it appealed to the conscious workers of Britain, France, and Germany, calling on them to help carry out the cause of peace and the cause of liberating the exploited working people from all slavery and all exploitation. Because Britain and France refused to conduct peace negotiations, the Soviet government decided to negotiate with Germany and Austria and conclude the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, withdrawing from the imperialist war.

　　From the victory of the revolution to 1921, the Soviet government made peace proposals twenty times, all of which were rejected by imperialist countries. After eliminating armed intervention and ending the civil war, the Soviet government signed non-aggression treaties with Turkey, Afghanistan, Lithuania, Latvia, Poland, and other countries. After Hitler came to power, the Soviet government tried to establish collective security to prevent the Nazis from launching a war of aggression and signed mutual assistance agreements with France, Czechoslovakia, and Outer Mongolia one after another; however, due to the reactionary ruling class of Britain, France, Poland, and other countries' policy of appeasement towards fascism, attempting to induce Germany to attack the Soviet Union to the east, the Soviet Union's efforts for collective security could not succeed. After the Second World War, the Soviet Union has always adhered to the Potsdam Agreement and the United Nations Charter to maintain world democratic peace.

　　In order to maintain world peace, the Soviet Union has consistently advocated universal disarmament, or at least arms reduction, since the Genoa Conference in 1922. At the Disarmament Conference in 1932, it put forward the historically famous proposal for universal, complete, and rapid abolition of all armed forces. After the Second World War, Molotov proposed at the United Nations General Assembly in 1946 that all countries reduce all their land, sea, and air forces by one-third within one year. These proposals for disarmament and arms reduction have been opposed by imperialist countries.

　　At the United Nations meetings, the Soviet Union has always advocated the immediate establishment of an agreement to prohibit the use of atomic weapons, destroy the manufactured atomic bombs, and establish an international agency to control atomic weapons. But this reasonable proposal has also been opposed by the war provocateurs of imperialism.

　　From this, it can be seen that the Soviet Union has proved in practical actions that it is faithful to the peace policy and is constantly striving to maintain world peace through non-aggression treaties, collective security systems, abolition or reduction of armaments, and prohibition of atomic weapons.

　　Advocate open diplomacy, faithfully fulfill treaty obligations
　　Another characteristic of Soviet foreign policy is to advocate open diplomacy, oppose secret diplomacy, strictly fulfill international treaty obligations, and oppose breach of contract and bad faith.

　　The interests of the ruling class and the ruled class in imperialist countries are contradictory. The ruling class is afraid of telling the truth about the purpose and intentions of the government's policies, so it tries its best not to let the masses of the people know; when it has to explain it, it also conceals and paints colors. The deeper the conflict of interests between the rulers and the masses of the people, the less dare its diplomacy to be open, and the more hypocritical the wording. The reason why the diplomacy of imperialism must be secret diplomacy is because its true purpose cannot be told to the masses of the people.

　　Conversely, socialist Soviet Union has no class antagonism, no class conflict of interests, and the interests of the people of the whole country are consistent. The government has nothing to hide from its own people. The Soviet government tells the entire people the true international situation and its own policies at any time and any place, and gains the unanimous support of the whole country. Therefore, the Soviet Union opposes secret diplomacy and advocates open diplomacy.

　　Whenever the international situation is tense, the Soviet Union often tells the people of the world the true situation, exposes the diplomatic tricks, hypocrisy, and deception of the rulers of imperialist countries, and calls on the masses of the people of all countries to rise up and stop the aggressive activities and war-mongering behaviors of the reactionary rulers of their own countries.

　　The openness, frankness, and straightforwardness of Soviet diplomacy often put the imperialist diplomacy, which cannot see the light, into trouble.

　　Moreover, the Soviet Union is faithful to its international treaty obligations. In the past thirty years, the Soviet Union has never evaded its obligations. Even the staunch anti-Soviet Churchill had to admit that "at no time, no government has implemented its obligations so faithfully as the Soviet Union, even if it is detrimental to itself."

　　The diplomacy of the Soviet Union must be consistent in word and deed and keep its promises. Comrade Stalin said: "There are a group of politicians who promise something or make a statement today, but either forget it the second time, or deny what they have promised. They do this without even blushing. We cannot do this. What is done externally will also be known internally, and all workers and farmers will also know. If we say one thing and do another, we will lose our credibility."

　　The diplomacy of imperialism is untrustworthy, saying one thing and doing another; signing an agreement today, the ink is not dry, and tomorrow it will be broken.

　　This situation makes the Soviet Union often independently maintain international agreements—such as the Potsdam Agreement and the United Nations Charter.

　　The main characteristics of Soviet diplomacy, simply put, are as follows.

　　论苏联外交政策的特点
  　外交政策决定于经济制度
    柯柏年
    一国底外交政策，归根到底是决定于该国底经济制度。帝国主义国家底外交政策，不管执政的是哪一个政党，是民主党抑共和党（如美国），是保守党、自由党抑工党（如英国），只要其资本帝国主义制度仍然继续存在，就必然是维护其本国底独占资本、金融资本底利益，就必然是扩张的政策、侵略的政策、瓜分世界的政策、战争的政策。实现这一政策所用的方法方式，可能有所不同，但其实质是不变的。反之，苏联底经济制度是社会主义，其外交政策就只能是维持国际和平的政策，只能是护卫一切弱小民族底主权平等的政策。
    在社会主义的苏联国内，废除了人剥削人的制度。生产不是为着少数人底利润，而是为着全体人民底生活；不是无政府的状态，而是计划经济。生产力底提高，意味着全体人民底生活水准底提高，劳动时间底缩短。不会有生产相对过剩，不会有经济恐慌，不会有失业，不会有资本过剩。生产力底无限的提高，正是实现“各尽所能，各取所需”的共产主义之必要前提条件。苏联虽也与外国进行贸易，但这是以其所有，易其所无；是互助的，而不是侵略的。
    社会主义的苏联决不会因要避免经济恐慌而为其相对过剩的商品找求国外市场，决不会要为其过剩的资本找求国外投资场所，所以，决不会因为要垄断国外市场或因为要保障国外投资安全而侵略别国、或争夺殖民地。
    社会主义底本质是反侵略的。社会主义，在国内没有阶级剥削、阶级压迫，对外也不能有民族剥削、民族压迫。
    社会主义的苏联底外交政策，是从苏联全体二万万人民底利益出发，而苏联人民底利益与全世界劳动人民底利益是基本一致的。正因为这个缘故，苏联成为全世界劳动人民底真正利益底热烈拥护者，而全世界劳动人民也坚决拥护苏联底外交政策。
    反对民族压迫，主张民族自决
    苏联底外交政策底最主要的特点，就是反对民族压迫，主张民族自决；反对狭隘的民族主义，主张真正的国际主义；积极帮助弱小民族底民族解放运动，维护它们底利益。
    对别民族的剥削，加强了本国统治阶级底地位。因此，压迫别民族的民族，其本身是得不到解放的。帮助被压迫被剥削的别民族底解放，就削弱了本国统治阶级底力量，因而便利于无产阶级起来推翻它。所以，无产阶级之赞助被压迫被剥削的民族底解放，并不是一个抽象的正义或人类的同情之问题，而是他们自己的社会解放底第一条件。
    俄国无产阶级在革命胜利之后，立即就承认民族自决权，发布了斯大林同志所起草的“俄国各族人民权利宣言”，把俄国各民族自由发展和各民族权利完全平等定为法律。
    “自决权即是一个民族可以按自己的愿望建立国家。它有权在自治的基础上建立它底国内生活，它有权与其他民族建立联邦的关系。它有完全分立的权利。每一民族都是主权国，一切民族都是平等的。”斯大林说。
    为什么要承认民族自决权直至分离独立的自由呢？列宁说：“民族的反感，不会很快就消灭：被压迫民族对于压迫民族之怨恨——这种怨恨是很正当的——将继续留存一个时间；只在社会主义胜利之后，只在最后建立起各民族间的完全民主的关系之后，才会消灭。如果我们想要忠实于社会主义，我们现在就要进行群众底国际主义的教育，但要在压迫民族中进行这种教育，如果不宣传被压迫民族有分离之自由，那就不可能了。”
    所以，在俄国社会主义革命成功之后，芬兰、爱沙尼亚、拉特维亚、立陶宛等相继获得独立。俄罗斯苏维埃联邦社会主义共和国则“建筑在各自由民族底自由联盟的基础上，是各个苏维埃民族共和国底联邦”。（劳动者及被压迫者权利宣言）
    一九二二年十二月，俄国境内所有的苏维埃共和国都按自愿与平权原则，联合成一个统一的苏维埃国家联盟——苏联，同时每个共和国都保留有自由退出苏联之权。
    苏联胜利的无产阶级政权，根据马列主义的民族自决底原则，彻底废除了过去沙皇时代的对国内弱小民族的压迫、剥削政策，解决了国内的民族问题，树立了各民族间民主平等合作底模范。
    援助弱小民族底解放运动
    苏联对于国外的一切殖民地半殖民地底被压迫民族，尽一切可能帮助其摆脱帝国主义压迫的民族解放运动，在一切国际会议上为它们底主权而仗义执言，不屈不挠地维护它们底利益。
    在帝国主义时代，一切殖民地半殖民地底民族解放运动，是无产阶级世界革命底一部分。斯大林同志在“论列宁主义基础”一书中说道：“列宁主义已经证明，而帝国主义战争和俄国革命又已经证实：民族问题只有与无产阶级革命相联系和在无产阶级革命基础上，才能得到解决，而西方革命必须与殖民地和附属国反帝解放运动结成革命联盟，才能得到胜利。民族问题是无产阶级革命总问题中的一部分，是无产阶级夺政问题中的一部分。”“列宁主义……认为被压迫国民族解放运动含有革命能力，认为可以运用这些革命能力来力谋推翻共同的敌人，来力谋推翻帝国主义。”“由此可见，无产阶级必须帮助，必须坚决地积极地帮助各被压迫民族和依赖民族底民族解放运动。”
    十月革命胜利之后，苏维埃政府立即宣布废除过去沙皇政府与其他帝国主义国家所订立的关于瓜分波斯和瓜分土耳其的秘密协定，宣布放弃俄国在中国、波斯等国的特殊利益。在一九二一年先后与波斯、土耳其、阿富汗签订了平等的友好条约，在一九二四年与中国订立平等的新约而废弃过去的不平等条约。不仅如此，它还坚决地积极地尽一切可能帮助土耳其底民族解放运动，帮助中国底国民革命（一九二五——二七年的第一次大革命）。
    在苏联加入国际联盟之后，它曾经在国联会议中坚决反对意大利侵略阿比西尼亚，彻底实行对意的经济制裁；曾经坚决反对德意之扶植佛朗哥叛军，而尽一切可能援助西班牙共和政府；曾经坚决反对纳粹德国之侵害捷克底独立生存，抨击慕尼黑会议之出卖捷克。
    在第二次世界大战之后，苏联在联合国会议中，曾经坚决主张托管制底目的是在于使被托管的民族获得完全的独立；曾经坚决反对英美之援助希腊反动政府进攻希腊民主力量；曾经坚决反对美帝国主义在南朝鲜建立反动傀儡政府而分裂朝鲜；曾经坚决维护印度尼西亚的民族解放运动，反对美帝国主义之援助荷兰进行殖民地战争；曾经坚决反对南非之歧视印度人。
    对于战败国，苏联仅仅是主张它们必须彻底非军国主义化与民主化，使其不再危害世界和平，使其不再有可能侵害邻邦；同时，苏联又坚持它们底人民有权利选择其政府。
    苏联自从立国以来，直至今日，它始终是弱小民族底主权、独立底维护者，始终是它们底民族解放运动底积极帮助者，始终是它们底唯一可靠的真正朋友。
    维护民主的和平，反对侵略的战争
    苏联底外交政策底另一主要的特点，就是力求保持世界底和平——民主的和平，持久的和平。
    苏联底和平政策，并不是当它在社会主义革命刚成功被十四个国家武装干涉、被帝国主义所包围、它比较弱的时候的一时权宜的政策，而是它底一贯的国策。在第二次世界大战之后，它已成为世界上最强大的国家之一，它底外交政策，仍然是和平政策。苏联底和平政策，不是一时的过渡的现象，而是始终一贯的国策，因为这是由苏联人民底基本利益与现实需要中产生的。
    因为社会主义底本质是反侵略的，反民族压迫的，反民族剥削的，所以，苏联反对一切为重新瓜分世界的侵略主义的战争。
    因为在战争中受害最重的是广大劳动群众，作战的军队主要是由劳动群众构成的，战费主要是由劳动群众负担的；资产阶级却大发其战争财。例如，美国底公司利润（纳税后），在战前的五年间（一九三五——三九年）为一五三亿美元，在战时的五年间（一九四○——四四年）则增为四二三亿美元，约为战前之三倍。所以，帝国主义国家中有大批的从事挑拨战争的政客，一心一意地破坏世界和平。苏联则不仅代表苏联人民底利益，也代表全世界底广大劳动人民底利益，不屈不挠地维护和平，反对战争。
    因为马列主义者始终反对一切与“输出革命”有关的理论，恩格斯曾经明确地指出，“胜利的无产阶级，不能把任何种幸福，强给任何外国，如果这样干，那就未有不把它自己的胜利葬送掉的”。所以，当俄国底无产阶级已经取得革命胜利而其他国家底无产阶级革命尚未成熟时，就必然会有社会主义与资本主义国家共同存在的时期。两种不同制度的国家，是有可能合作的。斯大林同志在一九四七年与美国史达森谈话中，说道：“这两种经济制度当然能互相合作。德国和美国底经济制度是相同的，但是两国之间却发生了战争。美国和苏联底经济制度并不相同，但是两国并没有交战，而且在战时合作了，假使两种不同的制度能在战时合作，那末为什么不能在和平时期合作呢？当然，很清楚，假使愿意的话，经济制度虽然不同，合作还是完全可能的。”“最先表示两种制度可能合作的是列宁。列宁是我们底导师，而我们苏联人民是列宁底学生。”“两种制度之间的合作是可能的，而且是有望的。同时至于说到苏联底人民和共产党，那他们是有合作的诚意的。毫无疑问，这种合作对于两国都有益无害的。”斯大林同志在一九四八年答复华莱士的信中，说道：“苏联政府认为，尽管经济制度和思想有着差异，而这些制度之同时并存以及苏联和美国之间的歧见的和平解决，不仅是可能的，而且为着普遍和平底利益，乃是绝对必需的。”可见，社会主义的苏联由于认为社会主义与资本主义之同时并存与合作是可能的与有望的，乃努力争取合作以维持和平。
    因为马列主义者相信在苏联一国有可能建成社会主义经济，而社会主义建设是需要和平。所以，苏联始终争取和平，俾得专心从事社会主义建设，提高生产力，增进全体人民底幸福，及早由社会主义过渡到共产主义。
    由此可见，苏联底外交政策，是和平政策，而且只能是和平政策。
    一切民族底主权平等是民主的和平底条件
    苏联所主张的和平，是民主的平等的和平，而不是某些国家支配其他国家的奴役的和平，不是骑马者与被骑的马之间的和平。
    斯大林同志说：“每一个民族都支持着他们愿意和可能支持的制度。那一个制度比较好——这让历史去证明。应该尊重人民所选择和拥护的制度。美国的制度是好是坏——那是美国人民的事，为了合作，不必要求各民族有相同的制度，应该尊重人民所拥护的制度。只有在这条件之下，合作才有可能。”
    承认每一民族有选择自己的制度之权利，苏联不干涉美国底内政，美国也不能干涉苏联底内政，一切民族底主权平等是国际间的民主的和平底前提条件；这也就是苏联所一贯坚持的国际关系底原则。
    莫洛托夫说：“在国际生活中，有两个直接相反的方法，一是压迫与支配的方法，对于实行此一方法之一切压榨手段都是对的；一是（还未十分通行的）以一切无论大小的国家底平等及合法利益底原则为根据的民主合作方法。”前者是帝国主义国家所实行的方法，后者是苏联所实行的方法。
    英国星期泰晤士报记者惠尔斯问斯大林同志：“苏联和西方各民主国之间，尽管存在着思想上的差异，但有实行友谊而长久的合作的可能性么？阁下相信华莱士演说辞中所说起的两种体系之间的友谊的竞赛么？”斯大林同志回答说：“绝对相信。”由于苏联对社会主义制度底优越有绝对的信心，深信社会主义制度在和平竞赛中必然将胜过资本主义制度，所以，毫不动摇地坚持和平、坚持合作、坚持竞赛、坚持各国人民有自由选择本国底制度。反之，帝国主义国家底统治阶级对资本主义制度在与社会主义制度竞赛中的前途丧失了信心，所以，惧怕竞赛，无时无刻不在企图消灭社会主义的苏联，进行各式各样的反苏的阴谋。
    帝国主义国家对于苏联是采取挑拨战争政策，敌对的包围政策，干涉政策。它们对于苏联，没有合作的诚意。苏联底政策，斯大林同志说：是“依然愿与一切国家（以英美为首）增进政治经济关系。如果那些国家愿意与苏联增进关系，苏联不顾彼此政治与社会制度底歧异，倒履趋迎。因为经验已证明，政治与社会制度不同的国家，彼此合作，完全是可能的。从另一方面说，如果那些国家目前不愿与苏联增进关系，苏联在不得合作的情形下，推行苏联坚定政策，一直等到他们理智清醒，认清了在当前世界的国际合作之必要。我们是能忍耐的人民。”
    可是，如果帝国主义国家底战争挑拨者不顾苏联底耐心争取民主的和平与国际合作之努力，而敢于发动对苏联的战争，则苏联将坚决给进攻者以打击。列宁说：“守着工农需要和平的意志，苏维埃共和国的政府从来不忘记有一界限，超过这一界限，甚至于最爱好和平的劳动大众也将被迫万众一心地起而用武装的巨手保卫自己的国家。”苏联为履行其国际条约的义务，也将被迫而不得不用武力来对付破坏世界和平的侵略者。
    百屈不挠，为和平而努力
    苏联自十月革命成功以来，曾经百折不回地奉行和平政策，为争取世界底民主的和平而努力。
    社会主义革命刚成功，苏维埃政府立即宣布和平法令，向各交战国人民及其政府提议，立刻缔结至少三个月的停战协定，以便进行关于正义民主和平的谈判。同时又向英法德三国底觉悟工人们呼吁，号召他们帮助把和平事业以及使被剥削劳动民众摆脱一切奴役和一切剥削的事业顺利进行到底。由于英法两国拒绝进行和平谈判，苏维埃政府乃决定与德奥两国进行谈判，订立布列斯特和约，退出帝国主义战争。
    苏维埃政府在革命胜利后直至一九二一年，曾经二十次提出和平建议，皆为帝国主义国家所拒绝。在肃清武装干涉和结束内战以后，苏联政府曾经与土耳其、阿富汗、立陶宛、拉特维亚、波兰等国订立互不侵犯条约。在希特勒上台之后，苏联政府曾经努力建立集体安全，以防止纳粹发动侵略战争，并曾经先后与法国、捷克、外蒙古订立互助协定；但因英法波等国底反动统治阶级底对法西斯的绥靖政策，企图诱使德国东向进攻苏联，以致苏联底集体安全底努力不能成功。在第二次大战之后，苏联则始终坚持波茨坦协定及联合国宪章，以维护世界底民主的和平。
    苏联为保持世界和平，自一九二二年热那亚会议以来，一贯主张普遍废除军备，至少是裁减军备。在一九三二年裁军会议上，提出历史上有名的普遍、完全、迅速废止一切武装力量的提案。第二次世界大战之后，莫洛托夫在一九四六年的联合国大会上提议一切国家在一年之内将一切海陆空军减少三分之一。这些废军、裁军的建议，都遭到帝国主义国家之反对。
    苏联在联合国会议中，始终主张立即成立协定，禁止使用原子武器，毁去已制成的原子弹，并成立国际管制原子武器的机构。但这一合理的主张，也遭到帝国主义的战争挑拨者所反对。
    由此可见，苏联已在实际行动上证明它是忠实于和平政策的，是不断努力以互不侵犯协定、集体安全制、废除或裁减军备、禁止原子武器等方法来维护世界和平的。
    主张公开外交，忠实履行条约义务
    苏联底外交政策，还有一个特点，就是主张公开外交，反对秘密外交，严格履行国际条约义务，反对违约背信。
    帝国主义国家底统治阶级与被统治阶级底利益是相矛盾的，统治阶级害怕说出政府政策底目的和企图底真相，因此尽可能地不让人民大众知道；在不得不说明它时，也是遮遮掩掩，涂上颜色。统治者与人民大众之间的利益矛盾愈深，其外交就越不敢公开，措辞也越虚伪。帝国主义的外交之所以必然是秘密外交，就是因为其真正目的是不能告诉人民大众。
    反之，社会主义的苏联，没有阶级对立，没有阶级利益矛盾，全国人民利益一致，政府没有什么东西要向本国人民隐藏的。苏联政府随时随地都以真实的国际情况及本国政策告诉全体人民，而获得全国一致的拥护，因此，苏联反对秘密外交，主张公开外交。
    每当国际形势紧张时，苏联时常以真实状况告诉全世界底人民，揭露帝国主义国家底统治者底外交诡计、虚伪和欺骗，号召各国底人民大众起来制止其本国底反动的统治者底侵略活动和挑拨战争行为。
    苏联底外交底公开、坦白、爽直，经常使那见不得亮光的帝国主义外交陷于困境。
    而且，苏联是忠实于它底国际条约底义务。在三十多年以来，苏联没有一次逃避过它所担负的义务。甚至连坚决反苏的邱吉尔也不得不承认：“任何时候，任何政府，没有象苏联那样确实地执行过它底义务，即使对自己有损的。”
    苏联底外交，必然是言行一致，信守诺言的。斯大林同志说：“有一批政客，他们今天允诺了一件事或发表一个声明，但第二次或是将它置诸脑后，或者否认他们曾经答应过的事情。他们这样做，甚至连脸都不红一下。我们是不能这样做的。对外所做的事，对国内也将会知道，所有的工人农民也将会知道。假若我们说的是一套，作的是另一套，我们就会丧失我们的威信。”
    帝国主义底外交则是不守信用，说的是一套，做的是另一套；今天签订了一个协定，墨迹未干，明天就破坏。
    这种情形，使得苏联常常是独立在维护着国际协定——如波茨顿协定、联合国宪章等。
    苏联底外交底几个主要特点，简单说来，就是如此。
