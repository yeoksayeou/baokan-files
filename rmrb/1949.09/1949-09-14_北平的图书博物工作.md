　　Library and Museum Work in Beiping
    Bai Sheng

    Beiping has the largest and oldest library in the country, the Beiping Library, the Palace Museum, and the Museum of History, which houses many precious antiques. After the liberation of Beiping, the People's Government carefully took over these three departments. The Communist Party and the People's Government's cherishment of Chinese culture can be seen from many facts after liberation. In the past, Beiping's libraries and museums were for the leisure class and some literati to study and appreciate, and had nothing to do with the general public. After liberation, the People's Government gradually carried out reforms to make them useful materials for the Chinese people to study history and culture, and to connect them with today's new culture. Obviously, this is a very arduous task.

    The Beiping Library was known as a "book storage building" before the takeover. People said that it only had "aristocratic culture," and it was difficult to see new culture books, let alone for the working people to get involved. However, on the first day after the People's Government took over, it publicly announced the sealing up of feudal superstitious and reactionary books and periodicals, and opened a new culture reading room. After more than half a year of efforts, there are now 3,000 kinds of new culture books, more than 8,000 volumes, 110 kinds of newspapers, and 244 kinds of magazines. In seven months, there were more than 120,000 readers, many of whom were workers. In terms of cataloging, the library sorted out books that had never been cataloged, and the efficiency of cataloging was increased tenfold compared with before liberation. In addition, exhibitions of historical materials of the Anti-Japanese War, the Zhao Cheng Tripitaka, and the exhibition of US imperialist aggression against China were held. These exhibitions are a new way to connect with readers, not passively waiting for readers to come to the library to browse, but actively delivering them to readers, and displaying and introducing them in a planned and systematic manner. The library also has an "interlibrary loan" method to facilitate the borrowing of reference books by academic research institutions and groups in Beiping.

    In addition, the Beiping Library also took over 400,000 Japanese books stored in the Taimiao Temple. Most of these books were written by the Japanese invaders after years of deliberation in order to invade China. There are many books on investigating and researching China and books on the construction of Northeast and North China. Various government agencies urgently need to refer to them. During the Kuomintang rule, it took two years to hastily sort out only one-third of these books. Now, it is planned to sort them all out in five months. This work began in mid-July, and more than 80 college students and some employees of the Beiping Library were invited to participate during the summer vacation. Their work efficiency and work enthusiasm are very high, and it is estimated that the plan will be completed ahead of schedule. After these books are sorted out, the Beiping Library will keep one original and one copy, and the rest will be distributed to various agencies and schools in need.

    The Palace Museum was originally the site of the "Golden Luan Hall" of feudal emperors, and the general public was not allowed to enter at all. Although it was said to be open to the public in 1925, the price of tickets at that time made it difficult for the working people to enter. After liberation, the museum received hundreds of thousands of soldiers and thousands of workers and farmers. When they saw the extravagant life relics of the feudal emperors, they all angrily scolded the ruling class of the old society and happily talked about the new world today. Their class consciousness and political consciousness were improved. They said: "These, these, are all made of the blood and sweat of the working people." In this way, the Forbidden City, which has always been a feudal fortress, has become a powerful weapon for educating the working people against feudalism.

    At present, the focus of the Palace Museum's work is on renovating the old and opening up the new, collecting cultural relics scattered in various regions and returning them to the warehouse, and speeding up the cataloging of uncataloged antiques. The museum has also added new exhibition rooms to the original three museums of antiques, documents, and books. For example, in July, the Literature Museum added a "Revolutionary Historical Materials Exhibition Room," which collected revolutionary documents and objects from the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom to the Xinhai Revolution (including two precious flags of the peasant uprising army). Recently, the "Emperor and Empress Life Exhibition Room" was opened, which compares the life of the emperor with the life of the working people. The Antiquities Museum added a "Jade Exhibition Room" and a "Textile Exhibition Room" as a special exhibition of handicrafts of the Chinese working people. The library also added a "Banned Books Exhibition Room" to expose the crimes of the feudal emperors in destroying culture. Recently, it is also preparing to open an "Exhibition Room of Historical Materials of Imperialist Aggression." These are of great educational significance to the people.

    In the past, the Museum of History was like an antique shop. There were many things, but they were displayed there completely unscientifically. During the Kuomintang rule, there was no catalog of antiques, only a journal account, which was prone to abuses. After the takeover, not only was the work of sorting and cataloging carried out, but also a large number of newly received antiques were received, and the collection of revolutionary cultural relics was carried out. The "Exhibition Room of Cultural Relics Donated After Liberation," the "Exhibition Room of Newly Received Cultural Relics After Liberation," and the "Exhibition Room of Northern Dynasty Cultural Relics Unearthed in Jingxian County" were also set up. The museum recently plans to change the display method of the large exhibition room to display cultural relics from various periods according to the order of social development.

    When arranging various exhibitions, because the revolutionary positions and viewpoints of some of the original personnel have not yet been clearly established, the positions are not clear when arranging various exhibition rooms and writing descriptions. Therefore, it is necessary to train a group of cadres in library and museum work, because the development of library and museum undertakings depends on the efforts of more library and museum workers.

    In the past six months, the Beiping Library and the Museum of History have received a large number of cultural relics and books donated by the people, confiscated from traitors, and collected during the land reform, totaling more than 250,000 books and more than 21,135 antiques. In addition to the 300,000 uncataloged books in the original 1.4 million books in the Beiping Library, there are a total of 500,000 books that need to be sorted and cataloged (of the 250,000 newly taken over books, 50,000 books taken over from the Beihai Songpo Library have been cataloged). The Museum of History has more than 200,000 uncataloged antiques, plus the newly received ones, there are a total of nearly 300,000 uncataloged antiques. This is a task that needs to be carried out urgently.

    In the future, library and museum work should also learn from the Soviet Union, and learn from the Soviet Union's decades of experience in serving the masses in library and museum work. Critically select the historical relics, and like the Soviet Union's special collection and exhibition of Pushkin's works, select the ones that can represent the essence of our nation and carry them forward; and pay special attention to collecting the emerging cultural property with the people's life as the mainstream, so that library and museum work becomes a more powerful weapon for educating the people.

　　北平的图书博物工作
    柏生
    北平拥有全国规模最大、历史悠久的北平图书馆，拥有故宫博物院和拥有许多珍贵古物的历史博物馆。北平解放后，人民政府曾慎重地进行了这三个部门的接管工作。共产党和人民政府对于中国文化的珍视，从解放后许多事实可以看出来。过去北平的图书馆、博物馆，都是供给有闲阶级和一部分文人研究赏玩的，是和人民大众没什么关系的。解放以后，人民政府即逐步进行改造，使它们成为中国人民研究历史文化的有用资料，使它们和今天人民的新文化衔接起来，显然，这是一件非常艰巨的工作。
    北平图书馆在接管前素有“藏书楼”之称，人们说那里有的都是“贵族文化”，新文化书籍几乎是很难看到的，劳动人民更很少能问津；但在人民政府接管后的头一天，就当众宣布封存封建迷信的、反动的书刊，开辟新文化阅览室。经过半年多的努力，现在有了新文化书籍三千种，八千余册，报纸一一○种，杂志二四四种。七个月中，读者达十二万多人，其中有不少工人。在编目工作上，该馆整理了从未编目的书籍，编目工作效率较解放前提高了十倍。此外并举办了抗日战争史料展览、赵城藏（经）的展览及美帝侵华史料展览。这许多展览都是一种新的与读者联系的方式，不是被动地等候读者来馆翻阅，而是主动地送到读者面前，有计划有系统地陈列介绍。该馆并订有“馆际借书”办法，以便利北平各学术研究机关、团体借阅参考书籍。
    另外，北平图书馆，又接管了存放太庙的四十万册日文书籍，这批书多是日寇经年处心积虑，为了侵略中国而写的。内有许多调查研究中国的书籍及有关东北、华北建设的书籍。人民政府各机关迫切需要参考。这批书籍在国民党统治时代，花了两年时间只草率地整理了三分之一，现在，预定以五个月时间全部整理出来。这项工作已于七月中开始，利用暑期邀请了八十余名大学生与北平图书馆一些员工共同参加。他们的工作效率与工作情绪非常高，估计将会提早完成计划。这批书整理完毕，将由北平图书馆保留正本复本各一份，其余分配给各需要机关、学校。
    故宫博物院，原是封建帝王“金銮宝殿”的所在地，人民大众根本不准进入。民国十四年起虽说开放了，以当时的门票价目来说，劳苦人民依然难于进去。解放后，该院曾经招待了几十万的战士和成千成百的工人和农民。他们在看到封建帝王们穷奢极欲的生活遗迹时，莫不愤怒地唾骂着旧社会的统治阶级，欢欣地谈论着今天新的世道，他们的阶级觉悟与政治觉悟提高了。他们说：“这些，这些，都是劳动人民一点血、一点汗造成的”。这样，一向是封建堡垒的故宫，成了教育劳动人民反封建的有力武器。
    目前，故宫博物院的工作重心是在整旧辟新，把散在各地区的文物提集归库，把未编目的古物，加紧编目。该馆并就原有的古物、文献、图书三馆分别增辟成立了新的陈列室。如七月中文献馆增辟了“革命史料陈列室”，收罗了从太平天国到辛亥革命的革命文献和实物（其中有两面宝贵的农民起义军的旗子）。最近并开辟了“帝后生活陈列室”，将帝王生活情形与劳动人民生活情形对比陈列起来。古物馆增辟了一个“玉器陈列室”和“纺织品陈列室”，作为中国劳动人民的手工艺特展。图书馆还增辟了“禁书陈列室”，以揭露封建帝王摧残文化的罪恶。最近更准备开辟“帝国主义侵略史料陈列室”。这些都是对人民极有教育意义的。
    历史博物馆过去好象是古董铺，东西不少，但完全是不科学的摆在那里。国民党统治时期连古物编目都没有，只有一本流水帐，易生流弊。接管后，不但进行了整理、编目工作，更接收了大批新收的古物，并进行了革命文物的征集工作。“解放后捐赠文物陈列室”、“解放后新收文物陈列室”和“景县出土北朝古物陈列室”也布置起来了。该院最近计划改换大陈列室的陈列方法，根据社会的发展顺序来陈列各个时期的文物。
    在布置各项展览时，因为若干原有人员的革命立场与观点尚未明确建立起来，以致布置各种陈列室及写说明时立场不明确。因此，很需要培养一批图书博物方面的干部，因为图书博物事业的发展是有待于更广大的图书博物工作者的努力的。
    半年来北平图书馆和历史博物馆接受了人民捐献的、没收汉奸的和在土地改革时期收集的大批文物图书，共计图书二十五万册以上，古物二万一千一百三十五件。加上北平图书馆原有的一百四十万册图书中尚未编目的三十万册，共有五十万册书需要整理编目（新接管的二十五万册书中，有接管北海松坡图书馆五万册已编目）。历史博物馆有二十余万件古物未编目，加上新接收的，总共有将近三十万件古物未编目。这是一件急待进行的工作。
    今后的图书博物工作，同样的应该向苏联学习，学习苏联几十年来为人民大众服务的图博工作经验。将历史文物加以批判的精选，象苏联特别搜集展览普式庚的著作一样，把能够代表我们民族精粹的选出来，发扬光大；并特别注意收集以人民生活为主流的新生的文化财产，使图博工作变成更加强有力的教育人民的武器。
