　　A History of American Aggression Against China
    Liu Danian
  　I. Aggression Against China by Following or Through Other Countries (Continued from VI)
    On November 23 of the same year, John Hay instructed the American Minister to Tokyo, Buck, to "promptly present the aforementioned proposal to the Japanese government for their consideration, indicating that our government sincerely hopes that the Japanese government will accept and assist in this matter." After Buck complied, he received a reply of consent from the Japanese Foreign Minister Aoki, and the American "Open Door" policy was soon announced and took effect.
    This policy, for a long time afterward, became the "motto" of American aggression against China, and it was not accidental, because the so-called "Open Door" did not have the slightest implication of "guaranteeing China's territorial integrity and sovereign independence." On the contrary, this was just a slogan directly opposing any one power or group of powers disregarding other countries and wanting to obtain exclusive privileges. This is precisely an alliance of imperialist aggression, running counter to the interests of the people in colonies and semi-colonies. Therefore, the proposal of the "Open Door" indicated the intensification of American attacks on China, not the relaxation of other countries' attacks on China. Moreover, this slogan had another ingenious use for the United States, that is, once the "spheres of influence" were broken, everywhere became its sphere of influence. This is a point where American aggressors were even more "brilliant" (vicious) than other powers.
    This alliance of imperialists attacking China once again aroused large-scale resistance from the Chinese people, which was the "Boxer" movement in 1900 (the 26th year of the Guangxu reign). The "Boxer" movement was a popular anti-imperialist movement with strong superstitious overtones, so from the very beginning, it was subjected to joint suppression by the imperialists. The United States, on the pretext of "exhausting means to protect the lives and property of American people in various parts of China... preventing the expansion of the chaos to other parts of China, and preventing its recurrence (!)," sent troops to China and participated in the "Eight-Nation Alliance." (In the telegram received by Li Hongzhang on June 5 of the same year, it also mentioned, "On the 27th, 2,000 troops from various countries arrived in Tianjin, with British and American troops in the lead, followed by other countries.") After the Allied forces invaded Beijing, the American commander Chaffee first supported the "Beijing Management Committee" organized by Waldersee. In the foreign ruling organ in Tianjin, the "Dutong Yamen," the American missionary Charles D. Tenney served as the "Chief Clerk," executing all affairs. In the Allied forces' massacre and looting of the Chinese people, American soldiers also demonstrated their "shrewdness and ingenuity" in this regard.
    As soon as the Allied forces occupied Beijing, the contradictions among the imperialists in vying for Chinese territory quickly sharpened, and they even openly discussed how to partition China. This was a fatal blow to the American "Open Door" policy, because it would leave it with no foothold in China. Therefore, it adopted a policy of resolutely supporting the Qing government, on the one hand, to thoroughly suppress the Chinese people's revolution, and on the other hand, to prevent the implementation of other countries' policies of partitioning China (naturally, the fact that China was not partitioned was mainly due to the strength of the Chinese people themselves). On July 22 of the same year (June 26 of the Qing calendar), the American government informed various countries: "Preserve the territory of China (note: maintain American plunder of territory)." Immediately afterward, it expressed to the Qing court its determination to assist the government in suppressing the revolution. On July 23, the American President replied to the Qing government's national letter:
    "The United States sent troops to land in China originally to protect the embassies... Knowing that the 'rebellious bandits' are disturbing China, it is not that your country's court is condoning them... Our country is happy to serve your country."
    How affectionate it was to the reactionary rulers of China! And how hateful it was to the Chinese people!

　　美国侵华史
    刘大年
  　一　追随或通过别国向中国侵略　（续六）
    同年十一月二十三日，海约翰训令美国驻东京公使巴克（Ｂｕｃｋ）要他“速将上述建议提出于日本政府促其考虑，表明我国政府切望该国政府接受本案，予以援助。”巴克照办后，得到日本外相青木同意的答复，美国的“门户开放”政策，不久便宣告生效。
    这个政策在以后很长时间内，一直成为美国侵华的“座右铭”，并不是偶然的，因为所谓“门户开放”，丝毫没有什么“保障中国领土完整和主权独立”的意味，恰恰相反，这只是直接反对任何一个强国或一群强国不顾其他各国，而想获得独占特权的口号，这正是一种帝国主义侵略的同盟，与殖民地半殖民地人民的利益是背道而驰的。所以“门户开放”提出，是表示美国对中国进攻的加紧，不是表示其他各国对中国进攻的缓和。而且这个口号在美国说来还另有一层妙用，即一经打破“势力范围”，便处处皆其势力范围，这是美国侵略者比其他列强尤为“高明”（毒辣）的一点。
    这些帝国主义者联盟向中国进攻，又一次激起中国人民大规模的反抗，这就是一九○○年（光绪二十六年）的“义和团”运动。“义和团”是带有浓厚迷信色彩的人民反帝运动，所以一开始，便遭到帝国主义者联合镇压，美国借口“尽保护中国各地美国人民生命财产之手段……防止乱事扩张至中国他处，并防止其再生（！）”向中国出兵，参加“八国联军”。（同年六月初五李鸿章所接的电报又有“二十七日各国兵二千至津，英美军在前，他国次之。”）联军侵入北京后，美军统领查飞（Ｃｈａｆｆｅｅ）首先支持瓦德西所组织的“管理北京委员会”。在天津的外人统治机关“都统衙门”，则由美国传教师丁加利（Ｃｈａｒｉｅｓ．Ｄ．Ｔｅｎｎｅｙ）为“总文案”执行一切。在联军对中国人民的大屠杀抢掠中，美国军人也表现了这方面的“精明巧识。”
    联军一占领北京，各帝国主义争夺中国地盘的矛盾就迅速尖锐起来，竟公开讨论如何瓜分中国，这对美国的所谓“门户开放”正是致命打击，因为这将使它在中国没有立锥之地，于是它又采取了坚决扶助满清政府的政策，一则以此彻底镇压中国人民革命，再则不使别国瓜分中国的政策实行（自然，中国未被分掉，主要是中国人民自己的力量）。同年七月二十二日（清六月二十六日）美政府照会各国：“保全中国疆土（按：保持美国掠夺疆土）”，紧接又向清廷表示扶助政府镇压革命的决心，七月二十三日美总统复清政府国书：
    “美国派兵在中国登岸原为援卫使馆……知中国‘乱匪’骚扰，并非贵国朝廷袒纵………敝国乐为贵国效劳。”
    对中国反动统治者表示多么亲切！对中国人民却是又如何地仇恨！
