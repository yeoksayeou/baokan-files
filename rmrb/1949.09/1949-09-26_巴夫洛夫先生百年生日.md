Mr. Pavlov's Centennial Birthday
    Lu Zhiwei

　　Mentioning Pavlov inevitably makes one feel ashamed. He began studying physiology at the age of twenty-five and never left his post for more than sixty years. It wasn't until the Soviet government built a brand-new laboratory for him that he was somewhat invigorated. In terms of the material conditions for science, he only enjoyed a little bit of happiness in his final years, under the Soviet government. He was always struggling arduously, even going hungry, giving his scarce food to the dogs. In the winter in Leningrad, there was neither coal nor light; that was the life of a scientific worker during a difficult period shortly after the October Revolution. As we commemorate him and celebrate his fresh discoveries, we should congratulate our friendly nation.

　　Pavlov never called himself a psychologist, as if there's no need for those of us who call ourselves psychologists to offer this neighborly sentiment. However, his works always mentioned "psychology." The psychology of the Tsarist era was learned from Germany and Austria. Abnormal psychology was learned from Paris. When the old gentleman was young, he only knew that Central European psychology had two schools: Machism and Brentanoism, both of which were terribly mysterious. He was trained as a doctor, so of course, he would feel that Charcot's school of abnormal psychology was somewhat promising, but he never fell into the trap of Freud's psychoanalysis. It was inevitable that he would deny the psychology of that time, but he never dreamed that his work would help lay the foundation for 20th-century objective psychology. In his own view, switching from studying digestive secretions to studying the function of the cerebral cortex was merely expanding the scope of the problem within the field of physiology. At that time, objective psychology was just budding. It was not until 1907 that a Russian scientist formally proposed the term. That scientist's name was Bekhterev. His theory also started from the behavior of dogs (a cold stimulus would cause a special reaction in the respiratory organs; using another stimulus to replace the cold stimulus would still cause that reaction). Mr. Bekhterev's book indirectly spread to the United States, pioneering Watson's behaviorism. Pavlov, on the other hand, was fundamentally unwilling to talk about the system of behavior. He simply worked in the laboratory, tirelessly moving from one scientific problem to the next. It was not until 1909 that someone introduced his work to the United States. By then, the historical conditions for objective psychology were already in place. Moreover, Mr. Pavlov's views on animal behavior were indeed more precise than Mr. Bekhterev's. However, behavioral psychology could not fully utilize his experimental results. Behavioral psychology was only built on the superficial phenomenon of "conditioned reflex," and did not mention Mr. Pavlov's theories concerning "excitation," "inhibition," and "the function of the entire cortex," as if psychology only relied on Chapter 3 of the book on conditioned reflexes and the rest, from Chapter 4 to Chapter 21, were dispensable. In short, Watson's behaviorism followed Mr. Bekhterev, not cautiously following Mr. Pavlov. The return of American objective psychology to the laboratory entirely depended on later generations. The most important of these was Lashley. He moved the study of salivary gland responses from dogs to humans. He also pushed the relationship between stimulus and response, and the phenomenon of animal learning, to the cerebral cortex, which truly carried forward the spirit of Pavlov. He also proved that the stimulus does not vent into a response along a fixed nerve pathway, and that the use of the cerebral cortex is holistic (or regional), not like an electrical grid. In Chapter 22 of his great work, Mr. Pavlov said: "We deliberately ignored the debatable question of where the two basic processes of excitation and inhibition are actually located, and we do not want to place them on any of the two units of the nervous system, namely nerve cells and nerve nodes (fiber connections between individual nerve cells)." When Mr. Pavlov began his research, nerve nodes were most popular. From this, it can be seen why the later development of objective psychology cannot be attributed to British reflex research or German invertebrate tropism research; why, in the final analysis, he must first thank Russia's conditioned reflex.

　　On the one hand, behaviorism retreated to the laboratory, and on the other hand, it could transform itself into commercial advertising and personnel management. This cannot but make us think of Mr. Pavlov's character. He would not ramblingly talk about another problem of a different nature from one problem. For example, he never used the dog's response to speculate on the human response. He only talked about people in the last chapter of his great work. In that passage, we can see how cautious and casual he was in his speech. Theory is theory, speculation is speculation. That book was written in 1926 based on the lectures of 1924. Before this, for twenty-five years, he had not discussed the entire system of conditioned reflexes, and he explained why he had not talked about the system in the past.

　　Pavlov later became the director of the Physiological Institute of the Soviet Academy of Sciences. His work could continue under satisfactory material conditions. Some of the early experiments may have to be redone with more sophisticated equipment. Those of us who admire Mr. Pavlov may feel a little sorry for him, but the old前辈, who strived to create the world, may not have seen it that way. At that time, he was almost eighty years old, and he had gone through so many years of hardship. I have seen a photo of him taken at that time, and he was still playing ball.

　　巴夫洛夫先生百年生日
    陆志韦
    一提到巴夫洛夫，不免教人惭愧。他从二十五岁开始研究生理学，六十多年没离开岗位。等到苏联政府为他建筑崭新的试验室，他已经有点精神不济了。拿科学的物质条件来说，他一辈子，在末了的几年，在苏维埃政府之下，才享了一点福。他老是在坚苦奋斗，甚至于饿着肚子，把稀少的食粮让给狗吃。在列宁格勒的冬天，既没有煤火，又没有灯光，那是十月革命后不久一段艰苦时期中科学工作者的生活。我们来纪念他，并歌颂他的新鲜的发现，我们应当为友邦庆贺。
    巴夫洛夫从不自称为心理学家，好象用不着我们这些自称为心理学家的来送这隔壁人情。可是他的著作里老是提到“心理”。帝俄时代的心理学是从德国、奥国学来的。变态心理学是从巴黎学来的。老先生年青的时候，单知道中欧的心理学有马赫主义跟白伦他诺主义的两派，都是神秘得要不得的。他学医出身，当然会觉着夏奈派的变态心理学还有点出息，他可从没上过佛洛依脱的精神分析的圈套。他会否认那时候的心理学，是势所必然的，然而他梦想不到他的工作会帮助二十世纪的客观心理学奠定了基础。在他自己看来，从研究消化分泌转变到研究大脑皮质的功用，不过是在生理学范围之内把问题扩大了。那时候客观心理学正在萌芽。直到一九○七年，才由一位俄国科学家正式提出来那个名词。那位科学家名叫裴希脱勒夫。他的学说也从狗的行为出发（冷的刺戟会引起呼吸器官的特种反应，用别的刺戟代替冷的刺戟，照样会引起那反应）。裴先生的书间接的传到美国，开创了华真派的行为主义。巴夫洛夫呢，他根本不愿意谈到行为的系统。他只是在试验室工作，从一个科学问题牵引到第二个科学问题，孜孜不倦的。到了一九○九年，才有人把他的工作介绍到美国。那时候客观心理学的历史条件已经具备。并且巴先生对于动物行为的见解确实比裴先生的来得精密。然而行为心理学并不能充分利用他的试验成绩。行为心理学只建筑在粗浅的“交替反应”（或译“制约反射”）那一个现象的基础上，并没提到巴先生的关乎“激动”、“抑制”、“皮质全部的功用”那些理论，好象心理学只依靠交替反应那部书的第三章就吃着不尽了，其余从第四章到二十一章都是可有可无的。总而言之，华真派的行为主义是跟着裴先生走的，不是谨慎小心的跟着巴先生走的。美国的客观心理学从新回到试验室里，那全靠后起的人。其中最重要的是拉希来。他把吐腺反应的研究从狗搬到人类。他又把刺戟反应的关系、动物学习的现象，推索到大脑皮质，那才真正发挥了巴氏的精神。他又证明刺戟不是沿着固定的神经路线发泄为反应，大脑皮质的运用是整体的（或是整个区域的），不象电线网似的。巴氏在他的大著作的第二十二章里说过：“我们故意的忽略了那可以辩论的问题，就是激发跟抑制那两个基本作用实在位置在什么地方，也不想把他们放在神经组织的两个单元的任何一个之上，就是神经细胞跟神经结（单独神经细胞中间的纤维联接）”。巴氏开始研究的时候，正是神经结最风行的时候。从此可见后来客观心理学的发展何以不能归功于英国的反射研究，或是德国的无脊椎动物的朝向研究；何以九九归原，他首先要感谢俄国的交替反应。
    行为主义一方面退回试验室，又一方面他可以摇身一变变为商业广告，人事管理。这更不能不教我们想到巴氏的为人。他不会从一个问题拉拉撒撒的谈到另一个性质不同的问题。比如说，他从不用狗的反应来推测人的反应。他的大著作里最后一章才说到人。就在那一段文章里，我们可以看出他说话何等谨慎，又是何等随便。理论是理论，推想是推想。那部书是一九二六年根据一九二四年的演讲稿写成的。在这以前，二十五年之中，他没有讨论过交替反应的整个系统，他并且说明过去为什么不谈系统。
    巴氏后来当了苏联科学院生理学试验所的所长。他的工作可以在美满的物质条件之下继续下去了。早年的试验，有的也许得用更精细一点的设备来重做一次。这在我们敬仰巴氏的人未免有点为他抱屈，可是在从奋斗创造世界的老前辈，他自己未必那样看法。那时候，他年纪快近八十了，何况又经历过多少年的苦难。我见过他在那时候照的一张相片，他还在打球。
