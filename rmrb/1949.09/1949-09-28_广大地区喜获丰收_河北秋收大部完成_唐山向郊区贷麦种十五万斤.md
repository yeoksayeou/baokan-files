Vast Areas Enjoy a Bumper Harvest
Hebei Largely Completes Autumn Harvest
Tangshan Loans 150,000 Jin of Wheat Seeds to Suburban Areas

[Baoding Electric Dispatch] Hebei has largely and victoriously completed the autumn harvest and is actively preparing for wheat planting. Farmers throughout the province, after arduous struggles against drought, flood prevention, and pest control, have overcome various disasters, enabling vast areas to achieve a bumper harvest. In early September, the entire province, except for the flood-stricken areas, successively entered the autumn harvest season. Currently, millet, foxtail millet, sorghum, spring corn and other crops have been harvested and stored. At the beginning of the autumn harvest, farmers in various regions organized various forms of mutual aid groups to carry out mutual assistance in harvesting, and combined this with fertilizing the land. Local militias and the broad masses of farmers organized joint defense to prevent bad elements and idlers from stealing crops. Local county and district leaders put forward the call to "harvest one plot, plow one plot," and farmers in various districts actively responded, plowing the land with livestock immediately after harvesting the crops. To save manpower and animal power, farmers in various villages combined transporting crops with delivering manure. In many areas, farmers implemented a system of selecting seeds before harvesting. During the autumn harvest, women in various regions actively participated in field production. In Changli County, over 61,500 women were投入 into the autumn harvest movement, overcoming the difficulties of labor and animal power shortages. Currently, various regions are preparing to plant wheat on a large scale. In Anping, along the Hutuo River flood-stricken area, planting is carried out as land becomes available. Many villages have already completed wheat planting.

[Tangshan City Electric Dispatch] There are nearly 110,000 mu of cultivated land in the twelve districts of Tangshan City. During the summer floods, approximately half of the land was flooded, resulting in a sharp reduction in output. The Tangshan Municipal People's Government called on suburban farmers to plant wheat on a large scale to relieve disaster and overcome famine. The Tangshan Office of the People's Bank of China closely cooperated with the Grain Company. After investigation and understanding, wheat seeds were distributed in a targeted manner, based on the severity of the disaster, in the form of loans in kind and repayment in kind, totaling 150,000 jin. The Grain Company has now prepared a large amount of wheat seeds. Farmers can obtain the physical seeds from the Grain Company after completing the loan procedures with the bank, preventing market price fluctuations of grain during the wheat planting season. The bank has now dispatched some cadres to cooperate with the district government in conducting in-depth inspections and publicity work for wheat planting. The Tangshan Municipal People's Government has also issued a timely notice, calling on all government agencies, organizations, troops, and state-owned enterprises to contribute as much manpower and animal power as possible to help farmers plant wheat.

　　广大地区喜获丰收
  　河北秋收大部完成
  　唐山向郊区贷麦种十五万斤
    【保定电】河北秋收大部胜利完成，并积极准备种麦。全省农民经过抗旱、防汛、除虫等各种艰巨斗争，战胜了各种灾害，使广大地区得以丰收。九月初，全省除水灾区外，相继进入秋收，目前黍子、谷子、高粱、春棒子等均已登场、入仓。秋收开始时，各地农民组织了各种形式的互助小组，实行互助收割，并结合耕地送粪，各地民兵及广大农民，为防止坏分子及二流子偷窃庄稼，并组织联防护秋。各地县区领导上提出“熟一块割一块耕一块”的号召，各区农民则积极响应，割完庄稼，随后就套牲口耕地。为节省人力畜力，各村农民拉庄稼时结合了送粪。很多地区农民实行了先选种后收割。秋收中各地妇女积极参加田间生产，昌黎县全县六万一千五百余妇女投入秋收运动，克服了缺乏人力畜力的困难。目下各地正准备大量种麦，安平沿滹沱河水灾区脱一块种一块，不少村小麦已种完。
    【唐山市电】唐山市十二个区内共有耕地近十一万亩。夏季河汛，约近二分之一的土地遭水冲淹，产量大减，唐山市人民政府号召郊区农民大量种麦，救灾渡荒。唐山中国人民银行办事处与粮食公司密切配合，经过调查了解，按灾情轻重，有重点地以贷实收实的方式发放麦种十五万斤。现粮食公司已准备好大量麦种，农民由银行办妥贷款手续后，即可向粮食公司领取实物，防止了种麦季节市场粮价的波动。现银行已抽出部分干部，配合区政府进行种麦的深入检察和宣传工作，唐山市人民政府也及时发出通知，号召各机关、团体、驻军、公营企业，尽可能地抽出人力畜力，帮助农民种麦。
