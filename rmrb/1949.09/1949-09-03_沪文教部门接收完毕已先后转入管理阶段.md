[Shanghai News] After more than two months of effort, the Military Control Commission of Shanghai Municipality's Cultural and Education Management Committee has basically completed the task of "taking over" Shanghai's cultural and educational institutions and has successively entered the "management" phase.

	In higher education: A total of 26 colleges and universities were taken over. This includes 15 public colleges and universities (10 national and 5 municipal); 2 research institutes (containing 12 research institutes); and 9 other cultural and academic institutions. The takeover involved a total of 2,796 professors, lecturers, teaching assistants, researchers, and staff members, including 1,725 professors, 489 lecturers and teaching assistants, 177 researchers, 536 staff members, and a total of 8,109 students. In addition, there are 33 private colleges and universities that are not within the scope of the takeover.

	In municipal education: A total of 503 public schools and educational institutions were taken over, including 28 middle schools, 292 primary schools, 28 social education institutions, 154 people's schools, as well as the Education Bureau and its directly affiliated units. The total number of teachers in these units is 5,517, including 86 from normal schools, 924 from middle schools, 99 from vocational schools, and 4,408 from primary schools. The total number of students is 176,412, including 13,732 from middle schools, 857 from vocational schools, 823 from normal schools, and 161,000 from primary schools.

	In news and publishing: A total of 58 units were taken over and subjected to military control. This includes 25 units in the news sector (18 newspapers, 2 news bureaus, 3 news agencies, the Nanjing Central Daily office, China News Agency); 30 units in the publishing sector (20 bookstores and publishers, 8 printing factories, 1 printing equipment factory, 1 academic group); and 3 units in broadcasting. There are a total of 2,314 former personnel, including 1,645 journalists, 591 publishing personnel, and 178 broadcasting personnel, as well as the printing equipment and materials of each unit.

	In the arts: A total of 16 units were taken over, including 9 film studios, 4 theaters, 1 orchestra, the New Life Club, and the Literary Recreation Center. There are a total of 1,738 former personnel, including 165 technical personnel and 1,571 staff members, as well as the photographic equipment and materials of each unit.

	During the cultural and educational takeover, the Cultural and Education Management Committee immediately grasped the broad united front policy on the propaganda front, striving to win over and unite intellectuals as much as possible, and conducting gradual transformation and education.

	In the education sector: Only three middle school principals who had to be removed were replaced. In terms of the education system, only the guidance system and reactionary courses (Party Principles and Civics) were discontinued. Reactionary parties are not allowed to operate. For church schools, only religion was removed as a compulsory subject. Appropriate relief was provided to teachers and students experiencing financial difficulties. A total of 5,596 teachers and staff members and 3,540 students from public and private schools received relief.

	In the arts sector: More than 8,000 people are directly united under the banners of the Shanghai Film and Drama Association, the Literary Association, the Poetry Association, the Music Association, and the Fine Arts Association. This includes artists from all fields, from film and drama to Peking opera, Yue opera, and various local operas, as well as comedic drama, etc.

	In the news and publishing sector: Newspapers and magazines beneficial to the people have all been published. The Liberation Daily, Xinwen Daily, Ta Kung Pao, Wen Hui Pao, Youth Daily, Labor Daily, Xinmin Evening News, New Children's Newspaper, as well as the Dagong Bao and Yibao, two small newspapers, have a combined daily circulation of approximately 400,000 copies (12 newspapers and 46 magazines have been approved for registration). The weekly forum of the heads of various newspapers, centered on the Liberation Daily, has been held on schedule. Seven forums for editors, reporters, supplements, managers, distributors, advertisers, and news education from various newspapers have also begun successively, laying the foundation for the preparation of the Shanghai branch of the Journalists Association.

	In terms of publishing and distribution, Xinhua Bookstore has joined forces with Commercial Press, Zhonghua Bookstore, and other bookstores to establish a joint publishing organization in order to print a large number of autumn textbooks; it has also united 552 book stalls and created the People's Book and Newspaper Supply Cooperative on June 29th.

	The Cultural and Education Management Committee also led various departments to launch study movements. The Municipal Education Department hosted a summer education research conference for more than 2,000 people; the Shanghai Municipal Federation of Primary and Secondary School Teachers and Staff hosted a summer new education research conference for 3,000 people; the Arts Department held a local opera research class.

	In the process of cultural and educational takeover, a multi-faceted approach of steady advancement was adopted. For example, for reactionary cultural enterprises jointly operated by Kuomintang bureaucratic capital and private capital, or with foreign capital, the new takeover method of "military management" was adopted. On the one hand, this ensured that the bureaucratic capital part that had to be taken over could be successfully taken over, and on the other hand, it ensured that the private capital part was not implicated, expanding the united front towards the national bourgeoisie.

    在文教接管中，文管会开始即掌握了宣传战线上广泛的统一战线方针，尽可能争取和团结知识分子，进行逐渐的改造和教育。
    教育界方面：只撤换了必须撤换的中学校长三人。在教育制度上，只停止了训导制度和反动课程（党义与公民）。不许反动党派活动。对教会学校，只取消了宗教作为必修科。对于生活困难的师生曾予以适当救济。公私立学校教职员工有五五九六人、学生有三五四○人受到救济。
    文艺界方面：直接团结在上海电影戏剧协会、文协、诗歌协会、音乐协会、美术协会旗帜之下者共有八千余人。包括了一切方面的艺人，从电影、话剧，到京戏、越剧和各种地方戏，以及滑稽剧等各方面。
    新闻出版界方面：于人民有益的报纸杂志都出版了，解放日报，新闻日报、大公报、文汇报、青年报、劳动报、新民晚报、新少年报，及大报、亦报二种小型报，每日共约发行四十余万份（核准登记的报纸十二家，杂志四十六家）。以解放日报为中心的各报负责人每周座谈会，一直按期举行。各报编辑、记者、副刊、经理、发行、广告及新闻教育七个座谈会也陆续开始进行，并为新闻工作者协会上海分会的准备工作打下了基础。

    在文教接管过程中多方面采取稳步前进的方针。如对于国民党官僚资本与私人资本合办的，或有外国人资本的反动文化企业，采用“军事管理”这一新的接管方式，一方面达到了必须接管的官僚资本部分能够顺利接管，另一方面使其中私人资本的部分不被牵连，扩大了对民族资产阶级的统一战线。
