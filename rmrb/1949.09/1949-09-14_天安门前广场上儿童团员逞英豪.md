Young Pioneers Show Their Prowess on Tiananmen Square
    Hémù (禾木)

    The Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League called on Youth League members and students to participate in the work of repairing Tiananmen Square. A total of 18,000 young people in the city signed up, more than twice the number planned. Among the 4,450 "workers," 150 were members of the Beijing Municipal Young Pioneers, representing all the children of Beijing to work.

    On the afternoon of September 10th, thousands of young people turned the square upside down! Everywhere was the sound of gongs and drums, everywhere were songs, and on the red flags were eye-catching characters: "Build the People's Capital," "Youth Labor Brigade"...

    The comrades of the Youth League Committee, fearing that the children would be too tired, assigned them half of a section of land at the southernmost end, and left the other half for the middle school students to repair. The comrades in charge of the team didn't dare ask for more. They all knew that most of the children had grown up in Beijing and had never even held a hoe. Now, asking them to level this half of the land would probably be difficult!

    Everyone decided to divide into three shifts, fifty people in each shift, one shift working each time, two shifts resting, and the working time was fifteen minutes. The first batch to work were from Dongbajiao Elementary School and Puli Elementary School. Before the command was even finished, they swarmed up, some grabbing pickaxes, some grabbing shovels, some grabbing iron rakes, and some "occupying" bamboo baskets. As soon as they got their tools, they started working, so hard and so freely, as if they had always been doing this kind of work.

    There were also several children who didn't manage to grab tools, so they asked their teachers for pickaxes and iron rakes. The teachers told them to help their classmates. They ran to the working classmates and asked, "Let me do it! You're too tired!"

    "Too tired?" The person being bothered wiped the sweat from their forehead and said, "Thank you!" and continued to work. None of them found an opportunity to help others. No one was willing to give up their tools. They were anxious and sad. Suddenly, a little classmate said, "Let's carry bricks!" This made them all happy. They ran to the place with bricks and piled them up one by one.

    The clock on the post office building wasn't even 3:13, and a large piece of land had already been repaired. "Oh no, they're doing all our share!" the second shift was anxious. The first shift seemed not to know anything, just lowering their heads to dig, rake, and shovel the uneven places. The photographer's lens was pointed at them, click! Captured inside.

    "It's our turn!" The second shift went up and disarmed the first shift.

    "What?" The first shift was annoyed.

    "What? Look," the second shift pointed to the clock and said, "It's exactly 3:15!" Only then did they quickly come down.

    "There's less than a third left!" the working classmates shouted happily. The third shift waiting below was very anxious:

    "Why hasn't it turned to us yet? There's almost nothing left!" They went to the teacher: "We have nothing left! They're almost finished!" The teacher couldn't make up his mind, so he went to the person in charge. They looked at the work situation together, then looked at the half next to it that they wanted to leave for the middle school, and then discussed it. They asked the students: "Do you have the courage to open up this half?"

    "Yes!" the third shift of students cheered, and the first shift also cheered. At this moment, the second shift came down, and they had almost finished that half.

    The third shift started working on the other half of the land.

    It took a total of ninety minutes, and everyone rotated twice. Both halves of the land had been completely prepared. Everyone twisted the Yangko, danced, "rode horses," and some ran back and forth on it!

    Soon they gathered again. Just now this place was full of weeds, bricks were scattered, and there were bumps and hollows everywhere. Now they were sitting on soft and lovely flat ground.

　　天安门前广场上儿童团员逞英豪
    禾木
    北平市青委号召青年团员与学生参加修整天安门前广场的工作。全市一共有一万八千名青年报名参加，超过了预定的人数二倍以上。在四千四百五十名的“劳动者”中，有一百五十名是北平市的儿童团团员，他们代表全北平的儿童来劳动。
    九月十日下午，几千个青年把广场闹翻了！到处是锣鼓，到处是歌声，红旗上写着触目的大字：“建筑人民的首都”，“青年劳动大队”……
    青委会同志恐怕儿童太累，给他们分了在最南端的一段地的一半，还有一半留给中学的同学去修理。带队的同志也不敢多要，他们都知道，孩子们大半是一直在北平城里长大的，根本就没有动过锄头，现在要叫他们把这半段地给刨平，怕不大容易吧！
    大家决定分三班，一班五十人，每次一班工作，两班休息，工作时间十五分钟。第一批工作的是东八角小学和普励小学。还没有等口令下完，他们就一涌而上，有的抢铁镐，有的抢铲子，有的抢铁＠子，有的“霸住”竹＠，工具一抢到手，他们便动手干起来，那么用劲，那么自如，就好象他们一向都是这样劳动的样子。
    还有几个来不及抢到工具的孩子，就问他们的老师要铁镐，要铁＠子。老师叫他们去帮同学的忙。他们又跑到工作的同学身旁要求说：“我来一下！你太累了！”
    “太累了？”被缠绕的人挥一下额上的汗珠说：“谢谢你！”又继续干下去。他们谁也没有找到帮忙他人的机会。谁也不肯把工具让出来。他们又着急又难过，忽然一个小同学说：“我们来搬砖头！”这一下，他们都高兴了，他们跑到有砖头的地方把砖头一块一块地堆在一起。
    邮局大楼上的大钟还不到三点十三分钟，而地已经修理了一大块。“不好了，我们的份他们都给抢做了！”第二班的人着急了，而第一班的好象什么也不知道的样子，只是低着头地挖着，＠着，铲着那不平的地方。摄影记者的镜头对着他们，拍！摄进去。
    “到我们了！”第二班的上去，把第一班给缴了械。
    “什么？”第一班的人恼了。
    “什么？你看，”第二班的人指着大钟说：“正好三点十五分！”他们才快快地下来。
    “只剩下三分之一不到了！”工作的同学高兴地叫起来，在下面等的第三班同学可急坏了：
    “怎还不转到我们？快没有了！”他们找老师去：“我们没有了！他们快都给做完了！”老师也拿不定主意，找负责同志去。他们在一起看一下工作的情形，又看一下旁边的那一半想留给中学的地方，又商量了一下。问同学们：“你们有没有勇气来开辟这一半？”
    “有！”第三班的同学欢呼起来，第一班的也叫好，正在这个时候，第二班的下来了，他们已经把那一半做得差不多了。
    第三班就在另外的一半地上工作起来。
    时间一共花了九十分钟，大家转流了二次，这两半的地方已经全部弄好了，大家就在这上面扭秧歌，跳舞、“骑马”，有的在这上面跑来跑去！
    很快地他们又集合了，刚才这里是野草满地。砖头乱丢，东一凹西一凸的地方，现在他们坐的已经是软绵绵的可爱的平地了。
