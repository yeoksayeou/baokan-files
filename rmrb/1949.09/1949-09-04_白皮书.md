　　“White Paper”
    Wang Yaping, Wang Zunsan
    Most hateful are the Americans, their actions so deceitful,
    一心反共又反苏联, single-mindedly opposing communism and the Soviet Union,
    They disregard international peace,
    Truly like poisonous scorpions in their venomous ways.
    They ship gold and guns outward,
    Hoping to dominate the world,
    But who would have thought the people of all nations have bright eyes,
    Unanimously supporting peace and the Soviet Union.
    The power of democracy worldwide is great,
    Making it difficult for the venomous American scorpion to sting people;
    But the scorpion has always been a creature that stings,
    And it will not be satisfied if it cannot sting the people.
    How could the American imperialists be so shameless,
    Their conspiracies and tricks never-ending,
    They also sent Acheson, a great villain,
    To publish a White Paper filled with lies.
    Its purpose is solely to invade China,
    Causing the people to be restless and unable to find peace everywhere
    .
    The White Paper is like a "Thick-Skinned Book,"
    Written with fifteen hundred chapters of conspiracies and tricks.
    The White Paper is solely to cover up for itself,
    Trying to conceal its venomous conspiracies.
    But who would have thought that its cover-up would fail this time,
    The people of the world can see through its evil schemes
    ,
    Want to know what the White Paper includes?
    Listen carefully as I tell you each item in detail:
    First, it wants to treat China as a colony,
    Where it can act tyrannically and arbitrarily be savage,
    It sells large quantities of military supplies to Japan,
    Giving Japan the power to expand its aggression against China.
    The July 7th Incident at Lugou Bridge,
    The Japanese devils want to seize China's beautiful land,
    American imperialism says it wants to "protect China" with its mouth,
    But it secretly helps Japan invade the Central Plains.
    Second, it blindly speaks nonsense,
    Always wanting to make the Chinese people's lives uneasy
    ;
    It doesn't say that Chiang Kai-shek deliberately started the civil war,
    Instead, it says the Kuomintang and the Communist Party have feuds;
    It doesn't say that the Chinese people hate the Four Big Families,
    But rather says the big bureaucratic capitalists' wealth is heaven-sent;
    It says it made "useful contributions" to China's peace,
    But in reality, it was to consolidate Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary regime
    ,
    Trying in every way to deceive the Chinese people,
    But trying to block the people's eyes is harder than ascending to heaven
    !
    Third, America sent Hurley,
    A villain and a fool, acting even more deceitfully,
    He wants to eliminate the people's armed forces,
    Helping the Chiang family's small dynasty to sit on the throne.
    He went to Yan'an to meet Chairman Mao,
    Pretending to discuss the formation of a coalition government
    ,
    Chairman Mao, for the sake of the people, did not mind the long journey,
    And even went to Chongqing to discuss peace.
    But who would have thought they would pretend to be garlic and change their minds,
    Taking the tearing up of treaties and lying as a joke
    .
    Hurley is truly a bloodless executioner,
    He has special means of harming people, each one effective,
    Such a fool and villain,
    Chiang Kai-shek actually treats him as a living ancestor.
    Fourth, it slanders the Soviet Union, saying bad things,
    Deceiving, creating rumors, and sowing discord,
    It doesn't say that the powerful Soviet army defeated Japan,
    Liberating the people of Northeast China by the millions,
    It insists that the Soviet Union is "invading,"
    Saying the American army is "protecting China" and bringing peace
    .
    It even demanded that the Soviet Union agree to it,
    To help the Chiang bandit troops land in Dalian,
    The Soviet Union didn't agree to this,
    So American imperialism turned against it, spreading rumors and slandering the Soviet Union.
    Fifth, America sent Marshall,
    His policies are so poisonous that he wants to turn the world upside down,
    First, it is to help the Chiang bandit fight the civil war,
    Second, it is to obstruct the revolution and prevent the Chinese people from having
    Democratic rights,
    He encouraged the Chiang bandit gang to establish a puppet National Assembly, creating
    A puppet constitution,
    But he said he wanted to mediate the China problem,
    He lived in China for almost a year and a half,
    Making the Chinese people see through his evil intentions,
    What kind of tail he wags, what kind of fart he lets out,
    It's all a trick.
    Sixth, America sent Stuart Leighton and Wedemeyer,
    To create new conspiracies and make evil plans,
    Stuart Leighton is completely a false face,
    Invariably double-dealing, outwardly sweet but inwardly bitter;
    Wedemeyer's plan is even more vicious,
    Wanting to jointly manage the Northeast with the Chiang bandits and have all the power.
    He vainly hopes to help the Chiang bandits revive China,
    Making the Chinese people forever slaves who can never stand up,
    Liaising with some democratic individualists,
    Wanting to establish a false peace reactionary government to seize civil rights
    ,
    All these conspiracies and tricks failed,
    The Americans are upset but pretend to be happy.
    Speaking of the seventh and eighth items,
    The road ahead for the Kuomintang is truly narrow, there is
    Only one path to destruction, wanting not to take it is harder than ascending to heaven.
    How ridiculous, America's cannons and tanks are truly numerous,
    And also a lot of light machine guns and heavy machine guns,
    Aiding the Chiang bandits without limit,
    All of it was given to the People's Liberation Army to transport things joyfully,
    American dollars amounted to fifty-nine billion,
    When the Chiang bandit gang collapses, who will repay it?
    This is like the bird flying away and the eggs being smashed,
    Clapping your hands and blaming heaven is in vain.
    Turning back to look at the Communist Party,
    It fought the Japanese invaders for a full eight years,
    Leading the peasants to turn over and engage in production,
    The peasants are happy as they are divided land and houses one by one
    .
    Immediately after, the Northeast army entered the pass,
    Armies from all directions converged in the Central Plains,
    Planting the red flag all over China,
    The power of the revolution is as great as a mountain,
    Thousands of troops and horses cross the river,
    All are the people's service personnel,
    This is all because Chairman Mao's policies are good,
    The people's victory is today's.
    Although America's White Paper wants to deceive people,
    The Chinese people are already awakened before our eyes,
    Its vicious conspiracies are clearly seen,
    Wanting to incite democratic individualists to be the Fifth
    Column, to oppose the people and block the road of revolution.
    All parties, all organizations, and democratic figures, workers,
    Students, scholars, and university professors, the
    People, men and women, everyone mobilize together,
    Resolutely oppose the White Paper fabricating rumors.
    Some say "The eyes of the Chinese people are bright,
    The imperialists' masks are difficult to hide;”
    Some say "He is covering up his failure, truly shameless,
    Distorting the facts and fabricating rumors, that is truly inappropriate;”
    Some say "Be more vigilant and don't be fooled,
    Revolutionizing until the end cannot be considered complete!"
    Some say "The White Paper is purely absurd and erroneous,
    We must distinguish between the enemy and us, and never fall into
    His trap.”
    The entire nation unites into a great battle line,
    Attacking the enemy without any leniency!
    Overthrow the reactionary forces at home and abroad,
    Puncture the paper tiger of America to its very bones!
    The people's democratic dictatorship is about to be realized,
    All Chinese people have democratic rights,
    Establish a democratic coalition government,
    Then we can have boundless happiness for tens of thousands of years!

　　“白皮书”
    王亚平　王尊三
    最可恨美国做事太欺天，
    一心反共又反苏联，
    国际和平他不顾，
    真亚赛蝎子毒辣一样般。
    他把金元大炮向外运，
    想在这世界上来称霸权，
    那料想各国的人民眼睛明亮，
    一致地拥护和平又拥护苏联。
    全世界民主的力量大，
    叫美国这个毒辣蝎子螫人难；
    但只是蝎子向来是螫人的物，
    要螫不着人民他心不甘。
    那有美帝国主义这样没脸，
    它的阴谋鬼计用个不完，
    它又叫艾其逊一个大坏蛋，
    发表了白皮书胡造谣言。
    它的目的光为了侵略中国，
    叫人民在它的扰乱之下到处不得
    安。
    白皮书好比是“厚皮书”一本，
    自写着阴谋鬼计一千五百篇。
    白皮书光为给他自己打掩护，
    想把他的毒辣阴谋来遮瞒。
    那料想他这回掩护没打好，
    全世界人民们都看清他的鬼算盘
    ，
    要问白皮书包括了那几款？
    细听我一桩桩一件件说个周全：
    第一款，把中国想当做殖民地，
    他可以横行霸道任意野蛮，
    他把大批的军火卖给日本，
    给日本把侵略中国的力量添。
    七月七芦沟桥上起事变，
    日本鬼要侵占中国的好河山，
    美帝国嘴里说要“保护中国”，
    它暗里帮助日本进攻中原。
    第二款，他瞎着眼睛胡乱扯，
    怎么也是想叫中国人民生活不安
    ；
    他不说蒋介石蓄意打内战，
    他反说国共两党有仇冤；
    他不说中国人民把四大家族恨，
    反倒说大官僚资本家富贵在天；
    他说对中国和平做了“有用的贡
    献”，
    实际上为了巩固蒋介石的反动政
    权，
    样样是想把中国人民来欺骗，
    但只是想挡住人民的眼睛比登天
    难！
    第三款，美国派来了赫尔利，
    这是一个坏蛋加昏蛋做事更欺天
    ，
    他想把人民武装来消灭，
    帮助蒋家小朝廷让他坐江山。
    他到过延安把毛主席会见，
    假装着把成立联合政府的事情谈
    ，
    毛主席为人民不嫌路远，
    也曾经赴重庆去把和平谈。
    那料想他们假装洋蒜变了卦，
    拿着撕毁条约说瞎话全当闹着玩
    。
    赫尔利真是个杀人不见血的刽子
    手，
    他专有杀害人的手段一着儿鲜，
    象这样昏蛋加坏蛋，
    蒋介石却把他当成个活祖先。
    第四款，污蔑苏联说坏话，
    欺骗造谣挑拨离间，
    他不说强大的苏军打日本，
    解放了东北人民万万千，
    他硬说苏联是来“侵略”，
    说美国军是“保护中国”得平安
    。
    他还要求苏联把他答应，
    帮助那蒋匪军登陆在大连，
    苏联没答应他这一件，
    美帝国就反脸造谣诬蔑苏联。
    第五款，美国派来马歇尔，
    他的政策阴毒想把世界弄一个地
    覆翻天，
    第一是帮助蒋匪打内战，
    第二是要阻碍革命不叫中国人有
    民主权，
    他鼓动蒋匪帮成立伪国大，制造
    伪宪法，
    他却说要把中国问题调处一番，
    他在中国住了快够一年半，
    使中国人全看透他的坏心肝，
    撅什么尾巴放什么屁，
    完全都是鬼套圈。
    第六款美国派来司从雷登和魏德
    迈，
    来制造新阴谋胡打算盘，
    司徒雷登完全是一张假面孔，
    一唯的口是心非、里苦外甜；
    魏德迈的主张更毒辣，
    想跟蒋匪共管东北都有权。
    他妄想援助蒋匪复兴中国，
    叫中国人永做亡国奴难把身翻，
    把一些民主个人主义者来联络，
    要成立假和平反动政府夺取民权
    ，
    这些阴谋鬼计全失败，
    美国佬心里难受装着喜欢。
    说到第七第八款，
    国民党前边的道路是真不宽，只
    有一条灭亡路，想要不走比登天难
    。
    好可笑美国的大炮坦克真不少，
    还有好多的轻机枪和重机关，
    援助蒋匪没顶了事，
    倒全给解放军做运输跑了个欢，
    美金元还拿出五十九亿，
    蒋匪帮一垮台可叫谁还？
    这就是鸟儿飞了蛋也摔碎，
    拍着个巴掌怨老天也是枉然。
    回过头来再看一看共产党，
    它是打走日寇抗战整八年，
    领导着农民翻身搞生产，
    农民们分地分房一个个喜地欢天
    。
    紧接着东北大军把关进，
    各路大军会师到中原，
    把红旗插遍全中国，
    革命的力量大如山，
    千军万马过江去，
    都是人民的勤务员，
    这都是毛主席的政策好，
    人民的胜利才有今天。
    美国的白皮书虽想把人骗，
    中国的人民已有觉悟在眼前，
    他的毒辣阴谋清清楚楚都看见，
    要煽动民主个人主义者来做第五
    纵队、反人民要把革命的道路拦。
    各党派、各团体和民主人士、工
    人、学生、学者们和大学教授、人
    民大众女和男，大家一齐动员起，
    坚决反对白皮书胡造谣言。
    有的说“中国人民的眼睛亮，
    帝国主义的假面目难把人瞒；”
    有的说“他遮掩失败真不要脸，
    歪曲事实胡造谣那真不沾；”
    有的说“多加警惕别上当，
    干革命不到底不能算完！”
    有的说“白皮书纯粹是荒言谬论，
    咱们要分清敌我界限，绝不能上
    他的鬼套圈。”
    全国人民团结成一条大战线，
    对着敌人攻击绝不容宽！
    打倒国内外的反动派，
    把美国纸老虎的皮骨都戳穿！
    人民民主专政马上要实现，
    全中国人民都有民主权，
    成立起民主联合政府，
    我们才能幸福无疆万万年！
