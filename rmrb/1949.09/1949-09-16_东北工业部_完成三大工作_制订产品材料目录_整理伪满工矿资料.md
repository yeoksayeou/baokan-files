Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 15th. The Northeast People's Government's Industrial Department has completed three important tasks in the past two months: first, the formulation of a product catalog; second, the formulation of a material catalog; and third, the sorting out of Puppet Manchukuo industrial and mining data. The formulation of the product catalog is mainly to understand the types of products in the current state-owned industries in the Northeast, so that various industrial and mining departments can order from each other according to their own needs, and avoid blind ordering from outside. At the same time, it also facilitates commercial organizations to promote industrial products in a planned way, so that commerce and industry are closely integrated and better serve industry. The catalog includes 33 categories such as steel, coke, electrical, machinery, chemical, cement, ceramics, paper, rubber, textile, and wood. Each product has detailed specifications, characteristics, units, packaging methods, uses, trademarks, and manufacturing factories, as well as other necessary precautions. For ease of searching and ordering, each product is assigned a number, and more than 2,160 numbers have been compiled. It is planned to use three-color套版精印装订 a large volume, with an index for easy checking. The formulation of the material catalog is to facilitate the formulation of material plans, to make the extremely complicated material management work consistent, and to overcome the various twists and turns and wastes in allocation and procurement caused by inconsistent names and non-conforming specifications in the past. The catalog is divided into eleven chapters: steel, non-ferrous metals, machinery, tools, instruments, electrical, chemical, fiber, minerals, kiln industry, waterway, heating, and miscellaneous items, totaling ninety categories, with more than 100,000 numbers. Each item is marked with detailed specifications, units, uses, place of origin, price, and Chinese, Russian and English terms. The sorting out of Puppet Manchukuo industrial and mining data is an extremely complicated task. The completion of this work has become an important basis for formulating the current and future Northeast production and construction plans. This work was jointly undertaken by the Survey and Statistics Office and the Planning Office of the Northeast People's Government's Finance and Economics Committee. More than 1,000 volumes of Puppet Manchukuo data were collected, made into concise tables, analyzed and sorted out, and summarized into eighteen categories, including all mineral deposits, annual quantities, number of employees, cost amount, number of main equipment, number of raw materials used, amount of investment, original name of factories and mines, current name, history, address, etc., and it is planned to print twelve large volumes. This is a historical summary of Puppet Manchukuo's industrial and mining industry, and it can also be said to be a dictionary of Northeast industry. The completion of the above three tasks is of great significance for formulating detailed production and construction plans for 1950. During the two months of intense work, the Industrial Department encountered many difficulties, especially the problem of unifying the names of various materials. Because many things in the past only had foreign names, and the Chinese translations were inconsistent, although a lot of time has been spent re-translating and checking, it is inevitable that there will be inaccuracies. Therefore, the final determination of the name will have to wait for the national unified translation to be determined before it can be revised.

　　东北工业部
　  完成三大工作
　  制订产品材料目录
　  整理伪满工矿资料
    【新华社沈阳十五日电】东北人民政府工业部在过去两个多月中，完成了三项重要工作：一是制订产品目录，二是制订材料目录，三是整理伪满工矿资料。产品目录的制订，主要是为了了解目前东北国营工业中产品的种类，便于各工矿部门根据本身的需要，互相定货，不致发生盲目的向外订货现象。同时亦便于商业机关有计划地推销工业品，使商业与工业密切结合，更好地为工业服务。该目录中包括钢铁、煤焦、电工、机械、化工、水泥、陶瓷、纸张、橡胶、纺织、木材等三十三类。每一产品都订有详细规格、特性、单位、包装方法、用途、商标及制造工厂等，其他必须注意事项亦有注明。为了便于查询和定货，每一产品均编一号码，已编定的号码达二千一百六十余，拟用三色套版精印装订一巨册，并附有索引便于检查。材料目录的制订，是为了便于制订材料计划，使极繁杂的材料管理工作趋于一致，克服过去因名称不统一，规格不符合等所产生的调拨和采购上的种种周折和浪费。该目录共分钢铁、有色金属、机械、工具、仪器、电气、化工、纤维、矿产、窑业、水道、暖气及杂品十一篇，计九十类，号码十万以上，每一种都注有详细规格、单位、用途、出产地、价格及中俄英文名词对照等。伪满工矿资料的整理，是一项极复杂的工作，这一工作的完成，成为制订现在及今后东北生产建设计划的重要根据之一。这个工作系由东北人民政府财政经济委员会调查统计处和工业部计划处共同负责，先后收集了伪满资料千余册，制成简明表格，经分析整理，归纳为十八类，包括所有矿藏、历年数量、职工数、成本额、主要设备数、使用原材料数、投资额、厂矿原名、现名、沿革、地址等，并拟分印十二巨册。这是一部伪满工矿业的历史总结，也可以说是一部东北工业的辞典。上述这三项工作的完成，对制订详细的一九五○年生产修建计划有重大的意义。工业部在此两个多月的紧张工作中，曾经遇到不少的困难，特别是各种材料名称的统一问题，由于过去许多东西只有外国名称，而中国译名又不一致，现在虽然费了很多时间去重新翻译和查对，但亦难免有不确切之处。故名称之最后确定还有待于全国统一的译名确定后再行订正。
