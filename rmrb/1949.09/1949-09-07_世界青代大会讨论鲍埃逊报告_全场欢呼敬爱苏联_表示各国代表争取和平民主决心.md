Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 6th: Budapest Dispatch: At the third day (4th) morning and evening sessions of the Second World Youth Congress, the report by Boiereson, Chairman of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, was discussed. Youth representatives from the Soviet Union, People's Democratic countries, colonial and dependent countries, and capitalist countries in Western Europe spoke enthusiastically during the discussions, all unanimously expressing their love and respect for the Soviet Union and Stalin, and their hatred for the American and British warmongers. They also stated the determination of the youth in their respective countries to strive for peace, democracy, and national independence, based on the specific circumstances of their countries.

The scene of the congress expressing love and respect for the Soviet Union and Stalin was very moving. Before the head of the Soviet delegation, Mikhailov, spoke in the discussion, the congress presented him with flowers, and the entire audience stood up and cheered to welcome the Soviet youth delegation. Mikhailov's speech was repeatedly interrupted by stormy applause. Every time he mentioned the glorious name of Stalin, and when he said that in our era all roads lead to communism, it aroused particularly enthusiastic cheers. After Mikhailov finished his speech, the entire audience stood up again and paid tribute to the Soviet youth and the Communist Youth League with stormy applause, paying tribute to the Soviet Union and the Soviet people, and paying tribute to the great Stalin. As the cheers subsided, one representative began to sing the lyrics of "How Vast is Our Motherland," and the entire audience immediately joined in the singing. The delegates to the congress thus excitedly sang the praises of the beloved socialist motherland, because it is at the forefront of progressive humanity, strengthening the confidence in a bright and splendid future in the hearts of people all over the world.

When discussing Boiereson's report, the Hungarian youth representative Holos spoke about the achievements made by the Hungarian People's Democratic Republic, and pointed out that Hungarian youth are standing at the forefront of the struggle to strive for the early completion of the national three-year plan.
