　　“The Plague God Has Arrived in Chongqing Again” Southwest Dispatch
　　Zhu Ping
　　After the People's Liberation Army crossed the Yangtze River, scattered "officials" and roving remnants of the Kuomintang successively fled west to Sichuan. The smarter ones were inclined to "return to their villages and fields"; the overly "clever" ones "waited and watched," attempting to seize another opportunity to make a fortune; and those whose official ambitions were still unfulfilled took advantage of the situation to continue their efforts to plunder. After the liberation of Changsha, this Kuomintang "central government," regarded by the people as a "plague god," shrunk back to Chongqing. The puppet Presidential Office and Executive Yuan were set up in the Huaxi Xingye Company and the Art School in Shangqingsi; the puppet Legislative Yuan was set up in the Broadcasting Building; the puppet Judicial Yuan was set up in the Obstetrics School and Zhengyang College in Gele Mountain; the puppet Control Yuan was set up in the Chuandong Normal School in Lianglukou; the puppet Examination Yuan was set up in the German Embassy in Huangjueya; the puppet Ministry of Interior was set up at the former site of the Immortal Cave and Qiujing Middle School; the puppet Ministry of Foreign Affairs was set up in the Municipal Library in Central Park; the puppet Ministry of Judicial Administration was set up in the Local Court on Linsen Road; the puppet Ministry of Finance was set up in Xiaoyuan on Kangning Road; the puppet Ministry of Audit was set up in the Chuandong Supply Bureau; the puppet Ministry of National Defense was set up in the Houxingguan Youth Middle School; the puppet Ministry of Economic Affairs was set up in the Chuanyan Bank Building; the puppet Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics was set up in Baxian Middle School; the puppet Ministry of Education was set up in the Roosevelt Library; the puppet Ministry of Transportation was set up in the Jiaotong Village in Shangqingsi; Lin Yuan was converted into a reception center for diplomatic envoys; the puppet Acting President's residence was set up in Liu Xiang's mansion in Liziba; and the Kuomintang Central Party Headquarters was set up in the Municipal No. 1 Middle School in Lianglukou. The people of Chongqing are calling out in newspapers and on the streets: Do not occupy their schools, do not occupy their factories... The Kuomintang reactionary authorities, carrying carbine rifles and with thick faces, have returned! The people are constantly preparing to welcome liberation.
　　The military and political situation in the provinces and cities of Sichuan, Kang, Yunnan, and Guizhou over the past three years has been in complete chaos. In the past six months, it has more fully reflected the Kuomintang's internal strife, corruption, and incompetence. Needless to say, the ones who suffer are naturally the good people. Military-civilian conflicts, military-police conflicts, military-gendarmerie conflicts, etc., are almost daily occurrences in various parts of the Southwest. In Chongqing alone, the puppet police bureau reported forty-eight such conflicts in June. On July 6, there was a conflict in which the Self-Defense Forces and Yang Sen's newly formed division each mobilized a company, with machine guns firing like a major battle; in mid-June, the dispute between the ground crew of the puppet Air Force's Fifth Military Region and the special service team of the 24th Arsenal was also quite a spectacle; in remote areas, such conflicts were even more frequent, such as the military-civilian brawl in Deyang on May 14, in which as many as five or six hundred people participated—why did they fight? Because the army was cutting down civilian firewood and seizing broad beans, resulting in the army being surrounded by the people, and guns and cannons were fired; also, on May 5, there was a conflict between the Sanqing Tuan in Pixian County and shop apprentices, on May 17, there was a conflict between the 44th Army and the Sichuan North University in Santai (one hundred and fifty-seven students were slightly injured, eighty-four were seriously injured, four were in life-threatening condition, and one was missing), and the military-civilian conflict in Yanbian on June 1 was even more serious. Finally, He Guoguang, commander of the puppet Xichang Garrison, sent two senior personnel, and the puppet Garrison Department sent Shen Huanzhang, the chief of the administration section, and Yu Cangping, the deputy adjutant of the puppet 136th Division, to negotiate with the local personage Zhuge Shaowu to resolve the issue. Just such conflicts, only those scattered in newspapers, amount to no less than four or five a day. Why are there so many conflicts between the military and the people? Because: (1) The Kuomintang bandit army has not been paid for two or three months, is underfed, and has no discipline; (2) The people's lives are miserable, and they are thoroughly disgusted with these bandit troops; (3) The bandit army, police, and gendarmerie have complex factions, and they compete for power and profit. They are a group of executioners and bandits who slaughter the people. How can society be "stable" if this group of guys maintains order? The private residence of Luo Zhiru, the dean of the Law School of Chongqing University, was completely ransacked by these official-bandit-secret agent types in early July.
　　The lower-level ruling institutions of Jiang Thief's government and their relationship with the people are like this, so what about the upper-level institutions? The entire Southwest is filled with contradictions between the puppet "central government" and the local authorities. The direct line forces of the puppet "central government" are pressing people at every step, forcing the local forces to the point where they can no longer endure it. For example, He Yingqin's nephew, He Shaozhou, constantly threatened Lu Han and local figures in Yunnan. At the end of May, Lu Han finally made a speech at the Yunnan Provincial Assembly, severely attacking He Shaozhou; He Shaozhou did not let up either, and made a reply in the Chongqing Dagong Bao. The people of Yunnan supported the Provincial Assembly, retained tax revenue in the province and did not remit it to the "central government," maintained currency independence, and did not allow the "central government" army or the Gui系 army to enter Yunnan. Originally, Jiang Thief had a plan to transform the puppet Southwest Chief Executive's Office into two regions, namely the Yunnan-Guizhou region and the Sichuan-Kang region, but he shelved it after seeing that the situation was not right. The contradictions between the puppet "central government" and the "local" authorities manifested in Sichuan and Kang can be seen in the relationships between Wang Lingji, Yang Sen, and Liu Wenhui, Deng Xihou, Wang Zuantu, etc. In Sichuan, Wang Lingji is the puppet provincial chairman, but Deng and Wang have the power to influence the puppet provincial assembly, so the "government"-assembly disputes have emerged one after another. And this kind of "dispute" is something Jiang Thief will never be able to resolve.
　　As for the reactionary military situation in the Southwest, what is it like? Yunnan is in the process of breaking away from the Kuomintang puppet "central government" and brewing independence. Guizhou is under the bloody rule of the demon king Gu Zhenglun and He Shaozhou. Xikang is Liu Wenhui's world, but Jiang Thief is most uneasy about Liu Wenhui. Under the conspiracy of "using barbarians to control barbarians," in addition to the puppet Xichang Garrison Command, the Four-Province Reclamation Committee of the Sichuan-Kang-Yunnan-Guizhou Border Region was established in June, with Wang Zuantu as the director. Therefore, Xikang has long been in a semi-independent state. The remaining Rong and Yu can be regarded as the only "base area" of Jiang-controlled Southwest. This "base area," like Guizhou, has become a thing in a bag exposed to the spearhead of the People's Liberation Army. And Wang Lingji, the puppet chairman of Sichuan, publicly lied at the provincial assembly in June, saying that "there are fifteen divisions in Sichuan Province, plus the Ma Hu Corps in southern Shaanxi and the Song Xilian Corps in western Hubei. In total, the troop strength of the first and second lines of defense inside and outside Sichuan Province is at least 700,000 people. The mass organization and training work has been completed in 123 counties, and 100,000 guns will be issued to the defense counties at a price in a short period of time." This fabricated number is really deceiving ghosts. Generally, according to the total amount of silver yuan food allowance issued by the Joint Logistics Department, one yuan per person, it is judged that the total number of Luo Guangwen's training department, Sun Yuanliang and Sun Zhen's corps, and Hu Zongnan's northern Sichuan troops in Sichuan will not exceed 200,000, plus the Hu and Song departments in Shaanxi and Hubei will not exceed 300,000. As for mass organization and training, listening to Wang Bandit's report, the 146 units of counties and cities in Sichuan Province seem to have completed the organization work, but it is actually an empty shell. In order to facilitate military transportation, in the Daba Mountain area of ​​northern Sichuan, civilian workers are forced to complete the Bazhong-Yilong Highway and rebuild the Sichuan-Hubei Highway, and puppet garrison commands are set up in Guangyuan and Lu County respectively. In Wushan, Liangshan, Fuling, Xiyang, and Nanchuan in eastern Sichuan, Leshan, Xuyong, and Qingfu in southern Sichuan, and Lifan, Songpan, Guan County in western Sichuan, and Zitong, Guangyuan, and Bazhong in northern Sichuan, 14 counties are set up with military radio stations. Due to the victory of the People's Liberation Army in Guanzhong and Longzhong, the puppet Southwest Chief Executive's Office was frightened and ordered the troops in northern Sichuan to complete combat preparations and re-equip the puppet Sun and Luo corps.
　　Under the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries' remaining forces, the national economy in the unliberated areas of the Southwest has collapsed. The financial crisis has reached an unsolvable level. According to the puppet finance minister Xu Kan's estimation, the puppet government's financial budget requires 45 million silver dollars per day (this is the estimate for June), and the deficit reaches 30 million silver dollars. Since March, no formal salaries or allowances have been issued to the puppet military and government institutions, and funding is even less of a consideration. The puppet agency offices are deserted, and military and government affairs are at a standstill, reaching the stage of paralysis. As a result, suicides due to the pressure of life often occur among military, government, and teaching staff. The suicide of a major medical officer and his wife in the Third Division of the puppet Chief Executive's Office is a typical example. Because the troops of each department have nothing to eat, Luo Guangwen once threatened Chongqing business leaders that he would launch 170,000 soldiers to visit Chongqing City armed with hand grenades, and "take a risk"! Soldiers' salaries are still impossible to solve, and construction projects are even less of a consideration. Even the ordnance industry is now collapsing. Chongqing's arsenals, such as the Tenth, Twentieth, Twenty-first, Twenty-fourth, Twenty-sixth, Twenty-ninth, Thirtieth, and Fiftieth factories, as well as ordnance units in Yibin, Changshou, and other places, and the Anshun Aircraft Engine Manufacturing Factory in Guizhou. Due to the lack of funding and raw materials, 70% of the work has been stopped since June. The Twenty-first Factory is a huge factory with a factory for making "carbine" guns, and it has also stopped work. The Fiftieth Factory makes "recoilless" guns, and it has also stopped work. After the employees are dismissed, they are forced to leave the factory and are not allowed to stay. 200,000 ordnance industry employees, regardless of technical or non-technical personnel, all leave! Unemployed. In order to prevent the unity of ordnance industry employees, they have strengthened secret agent rule.
　　A small episode during the financial difficulties was: the tax collection agency for goods tax "discounted" tax collection and salary payment on its own, the Salt Management Bureau sold salt to pay salaries, while the direct tax bureau did not even have food to eat.
　　The bureaucrats, landlords, and compradors of Sichuan, Kang, and Yu are frantically flying to Hong Kong, the United States, and the Philippines. In order to get the wealthy families to donate money and property for "self-defense," the "Joint Conference of Public Opinion Representatives of Sichuan, Kang, and Yu" elected the wealthy families of Sichuan, Kang, and Yu on May 17, including Wang Lingji, Liu Hangchen, Wu Peiying, Liu Wenhui, Deng Xihou, Wu Dingchang, Wang Mingxuan, Zhang Zhongming, Guo Wenlian, Hu Zhongshi, Yang Can San, Ding Shaohe, Liu Yuanzong, Huang Min'an, Gong Weiqing, Huang Ao, Xie Bingjun, Tang Shizun, Zhu Lianhuan, Hou Diming, Tang Hua, Zhu Liangfu, Lan Yaoqu, He Beiheng, Fan Zhongqu, Li Yunxiang, Xie Dekan, Xiong Congzhou, Li Zhudong, Tian Songyao, Diao Wenjun, Chen Shike, Yang Maoxiu, Li Shaoxi, Leng Yindong, Pan Yangshan, Liu Shucheng, Lin Minghe, Ning Zhicun, Yang Sen, Hu Ziang, Yan Xin＠, Liu Jiequan, Xu Kan, You Guangju, Pan Wenhua, Ji Ming, Wang Jiliang, Niu Xiguang, Wang Jiliang, Fan Shaozeng, Huang Rongsheng, Liu Wencai, Niu Lianfu, Yang Junqing, Chen Mingqian, Luo Youyuan, Xia Zhongshi, Wang Xuejiang, Zhang Qun, Yu Houqin, Huang Sifang, Liu Wencheng, Yang Dianzhang, Tian Zefu, Leng Pudong, Song Xijiu, Cai Henian, Zhou Xiaolan, Chen Shunong, Huang Yin, Liu Cunhou, Liu Xuan, Lan Wenbin, Chen Gusheng, and other hundred people, this list was only put forward when the wealthy families could not retreat and had to "pay to protect their property." This made the bureaucrats, landlords, and compradors uneasy, and even the general rich peasants became uneasy. Although they were going to "die," they still wanted to shift the blame to others before "dying." As a result, in cities, towns, and villages, those who "should sell fields" and "sell real estate" sprang up like mushrooms. For example, Chen of Naxiang, Peng County, owned more than a thousand mu of land, and the selling price was "ten yuan per mu of good land in Sichuan, buy ten mu and get one mu free." For example, the large mansion in Chengdu was selling real estate, and the real estate companies were crowded with billboards, and many tricks were created, such as "heavy mortgage and light rent," "20% or 10% off," and "one-time rent payment," etc., but still few people were interested. The suitcases of the Dagong mansion and the used clothing market in the Martyrs' Shrine were full of people selling at low prices, which shows the disturbance and embarrassment of the declining class.
　　However, the workers, peasants, laborers, teachers, and staff members in deep water and hot fire, national industrialists, and other vast people are looking forward to the arrival of the People's Liberation Army.

　　“瘟神又到重庆了”　西南通讯
    祝平
    人民解放军跨过大江之后，即有国民党的散“官”游勇陆续西逃四川。精灵一点的，大有“解甲归田”之势；过于“聪明”的则“静以观变”，企图有机会再大捞一把；一向官瘾未足的，则乘时利便，继续努力搜刮。长沙解放后，这个使人民视若“瘟神”的国民党“中央政府”，又缩到重庆了。伪总统府行政院设在上清寺华西兴业公司及美专学校，伪立法院设在广播大厦，伪司法院设在歌乐山助产学校及正阳学院，伪监察院设在两路口川东师范，伪考试院设在黄桷垭德使馆，伪内政部设在神仙洞旧址及求精中学，伪外交部设在中央公园市立图书馆，伪司法行政部设在林森路地方法院，伪财政部设在康宁路小园，伪审计部设在川东供应局，伪国防部设在后兴关青年中学，伪经济部设在川盐银行楼上，伪主计处设在巴县中学，伪教育部设在罗斯福图书馆，伪交通部设在上清寺交通村，林园改为外交使节招待所，伪代总统官邸设在李子坝刘湘公馆，国民党中央党部设在两路口市立一中。重庆人民分别在报纸上、在街头呼吁：不要占据他们的学校、不要占据他们的工厂，……国民党反动当局又端着卡宾枪，厚起面皮回来了！人民却时时准备迎接解放。
    川康滇黔各省市，这三年中的军事与政治，是在整个的混乱中。近半年来更充分地反映了国民党内部的倾轧、腐败、无能，不消说，吃亏的自然是良善的人民。西南各地的军民冲突，军警冲突，军宪冲突等等，几乎是无日无之。单是重庆市，这样的冲突据伪警局统计六月份达四十八起。在七月六日曾有一次冲突，是自卫队和杨森的新编师，各动员一个连，机枪哒哒，如临大敌；六月中旬伪空军五军区地勤，和二十四兵工厂特务队之争也很可观；在偏僻地方这种冲突就更多，如五月十四日德阳军民大会打，参加打架的人数多达五六百人——为什么打？为了军队砍伐民柴，抢取葫豆，结果军队被人民包围，枪炮都打起来了；又五月五日郫县三青团与商店学徒冲突，五月十七日三台四十四军和川北大学冲突（轻伤学生一五七人，重伤八四人，有生命危险的四人，失踪一人），六月一日盐边军民冲突更为严重，最后伪西昌警备司令贺国光派高级人员二人，另伪警备部派管理科长沈焕章，伪一三六师副官长余苍坪商同地方人土诸葛绍武去解决。就这样的冲突，单就散见于报章者，每日总不下四五起。军民为什么有这么多冲突，因为：（一）国民党匪军两三月不发饷，又吃不饱，又毫无纪律，（二）人民生活苦，对于这些匪军已厌恶透顶，（三）匪军警宪派系复杂，互相争权夺利，它们是一群屠杀人民的刽子手、匪类，由这一群家伙来维持治安，社会如何能“安”呢？重庆大学法学院院长罗志如私宅便是被这些亦官亦匪亦特务的人在七月初大洗劫了的。
    蒋贼政府的下层统治机构的内部及与人民之间的关系是如此，上层机构又怎样呢？整个西南充满着伪“中央”和地方之间的矛盾，伪“中央”的嫡系势力步步逼人，逼得地方势力再也不能忍受了。例如，何应钦的令侄何绍周步步威胁卢汉和云南的地方人士，五月底卢汉终于在云南省参议会发表谈话，痛击何绍周；何绍周也不放松，也在重庆大公报上来一场答辩，云南省人民支持了省参会，税收留省不解“中央”，货币独立，并不准“中央”军、桂系军开到云南去。本来蒋贼有将伪西南长官公署化为两区之议，即云贵区、川康区，后见形势不对便搁置了。在川康所表现出来的伪“中央”和“地方”之间的矛盾，可以由王陵基、杨森之与刘文辉、邓锡侯、王缵绪等之间的关系表现出来。就四川来说，王陵基是伪省主席，但邓、王却在伪省参会方面有左右之力，于是“府”“会”之争便层出不穷。而这种“争”是蒋贼永不能解决的。
    至于西南的反动军事情况又如何呢？云南是在摆脱国民党伪“中央”而酝酿独立的途中，贵州是在魔王谷正伦何绍周的血腥统制下，西康则是刘文辉的天下，但蒋贼对刘文辉是最不放心的，在“以夷治夷”的阴谋下，在伪西昌警备部之外，又在六月间设立了川康滇黔边区四省屯垦委员会，以王缵绪为主任委员，因之西康也早已是半独立状态，剩下来的蓉渝算是蒋管西南仅有的“根据地”了，这“根据地”和贵州一样都已变成暴露于人民解放大军矛头之下的囊中物了。而伪四川主席王陵基却在六月的省参会上公开扯谎，说是“川省境内有十五个师，加上陕南马胡兵团，鄂西的宋希濂兵团，总计川省境外境内第一第二两道防线的兵力，至少有七十万人，民众组训已有一百二十三县完成编组工作，短期内就有十万枝枪作价发给设防各县”。这个捏造的数目字真是骗鬼。一般人按照联勤部发放银元副食费每人一元的总数，判断川境内伪军罗广文的编练部，孙元良、孙震兵团，胡宗南川北部队，总数不会超过二十万人，再加上陕鄂胡宋两部也不会超过三十万人。至于民众组训，听王匪的报告，川省县市局一百四十六单位，好象已将编组工作完成，其实是一空架子，为了便利军运，川北大巴山区域，强迫民工完成巴中仪陇公路，重修川鄂公路，并分别在广元泸设置伪警备司令部，在川东巫山、梁山、涪陵、西阳、南川，川南之乐山、叙永、庆符，川西之理番、松番、灌县，川北之梓潼、广元、巴中等十四县设置军用电台，由于解放军的关中陇中胜利，伪西南长官公署吓慌了，着令川北部队完成作战准备，并重新装备伪孙、罗兵团。
    在国民党反动派残余势力统治下，西南未解放区的国民经济已经崩溃了。财政危机已达到不能解决的程度，伪政府的财政预算，据伪财长徐堪估计每日要用四千五百万银元（这是六月份的估计），而赤字达三千万银元，伪军政机构从三月份起便无正式薪津发给，经费更谈不到。伪机关办公室无人办公，军政事务停顿，达于瘫痪的阶段。于是军政公教人员逼于生活自杀的也常常发生，伪长官公署三处一位少校医官夫妇二人服毒自杀便是典型事例。因各部属没饭吃，罗广文曾经危胁重庆工商界人士，要发动十七万军人挂手溜弹武装访问重庆市，要“挺而走险”！军人薪饷尚且无法解决，工事建筑更谈不到，就是兵工工业现在也垮了，重庆的兵工厂如第十、二十、二十一、二十四、二十六、二十九、三十、五十等厂，以及宜宾、长寿等地各兵工单位，贵州安定飞机发动机制造厂。在无经费无原料的情况下，自六月份起已有百分之七十的工作停止了，二十一厂是一个庞大的厂，里面有一所造“卡宾”枪厂，也停工了。五十厂造“无座力”炮，也停工了。职工解散后，强迫离厂不得逗留，二十万的兵工工业职工，不管技术人员非技术人员一律走！失业了。为了防范兵工职工团结，他们更加强了特务统治。
    财政困难时的一个小插曲是：货物税的税收机关自行“折实”收税发薪，盐管局则卖盐发薪，而直接税局，连饭都没的吃。
    川康渝的官僚、地主、买办们，正在慌忙地飞香港、飞美国、飞菲岛。“川康渝民意代表联席会”为了要豪门出钱献产以作“自卫”，他们在五月十七日选举了川康渝豪门，王陵基、刘航琛、伍培英、刘文辉、邓锡侯、吴鼎昌、王明宣、张仲铭、郭文敛、胡仲实、杨灿三、丁少鹤、刘元琮、黄民安、龚渭清、黄鳌、谢秉钧、唐式遵、朱联桓，侯第名、唐华、朱良辅、蓝尧衢、何北衡、范众渠、李云湘、谢德堪、熊从周、李注东、田颂尧、刁文俊、陈诗可、杨懋修、李绍曦、冷寅东、潘仰山、刘树成、林铭合、宁芷村、杨森、胡子昂、颜心＠，刘洁泉、徐堪、游广居、潘文华、季明、王积良、牛锡光、王季良、范绍增、黄蓉生、刘文彩、牛联馥、杨俊清、陈鸣谦、罗莜元、夏仲实、王学姜、张群、余厚钦、黄肃方、刘文成、杨典章、田泽孚、冷曝东、宋席九、蔡鹤年、周晓岚、陈书农、黄隐、刘存厚、刘元暄、蓝文彬、陈谷生等百余人，这个名单是在豪门不能退缩要“出钱保产”时才提出来的。这一来官僚、地主、买办们固然不安，即是一般富农也不安起来，他们虽然要“死”了，但在“死”前仍想嫁祸于人，于是都市、城镇、乡村中“应变卖田”、“变卖房地产”者风起云涌，如彭县南乡陈某，拥有田产千余亩，变卖价“每亩好川十元，买十亩送一亩”，又如成都大公馆脱售房地产，各地产公司牌告摊挤不堪，并且造出了许多花招，如“重押轻租”呀，“八折九扣”呀，“一次交租”呀等等，但是仍然少人问津，大公馆的皮箱，忠烈祠估衣市场，贱价求售者比比皆是，没落阶级的纷扰和狼狈可见一斑。
    但是，水深火热中的工农劳动者和公教人员，民族工业家等广大人民却在引领盼望着人民解放军的到来。
