Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, 20th -

This month on the 6th, the Hungarian National Prosecutor's Office filed a public prosecution with the People's Court, accusing former Hungarian Foreign Minister Rajk and his eight accomplices of espionage and treason. The Hungarian People's Court began a public trial of this treason case on the 16th.

The lengthy indictment submitted by the Hungarian National Prosecutor's Office listed facts exposing Rajk and a small group of traitors as spies hired jointly by American imperialism and the Tito traitorous clique. They were sent to Hungary, disguised themselves to infiltrate the revolutionary ranks, organized spy networks, stole state secrets, and engaged in secret development of armed forces, assassination of government leaders, subversion of the government, and conspiracies to usurp power, in order to "enable the Tito group to control Hungary, thereby restoring imperialist rule in Hungary." The indictment simultaneously exposed the ugly and shameless counter-revolutionary faces of American imperialism and the Tito traitorous clique. As early as the beginning of 1945, Tito elements had become an important tool for American imperialism to engage in espionage and subversive activities in people's democratic countries. Therefore, this is not only a prosecution and trial of Hungarian traitors and spies but also a prosecution and trial of American imperialism and its running dog, the Tito clique.

Be vigilant, more vigilant! Crush the espionage conspiracy of the US imperialism and Tito
This major treason case in Hungary was uncovered by the Hungarian National Security Agency in May of this year. This is another great victory for the Hungarian people's democratic system and another major defeat for American imperialism and its running dogs in undermining the Hungarian people's democratic system. In May 1947, under the leadership of the Workers' Party, the Hungarian people crushed the treasonous conspiracy of former Prime Minister Nagy and his group, rescuing the people's democratic regime from danger. In February of this year, the Hungarian people suppressed the treasonous conspiracy activities of Cardinal Mindszenty, instigated by American imperialism, and continued to consolidate the people's democratic regime. Now, with the uncovering and public prosecution of the Rajk major treason case, the people's democratic regime is even more consolidated, and the vile attempts of American imperialism and its running dogs to undermine Hungary have suffered a crushing blow. However, we should draw the necessary experience from this event, increase our vigilance, and strictly guard against the underground activities that American imperialism and its running dogs will inevitably intensify to disrupt the new China.

American and other imperialists are also colluding with the Tito traitorous clique to carry out destructive activities against other people's democratic countries. In a note to the Tito government protesting espionage activities, the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs revealed that Yugoslav official representatives stationed in Poland, such as Petrovic, were buying spies in Poland, organizing spy networks, stealing intelligence, and conducting subversive propaganda activities. Petrovic has now been arrested by the Polish public security organs. At the same time, in addition to instigating the Greek royalist fascist army and the Tito army to constantly carry out military incursions into the borders of Bulgaria and Albania, American and British imperialism also established the so-called "Free Albania Committee" in Paris at the end of August, openly provoking the People's Republic of Albania.

Welcoming the International Day of Struggle for Peace
The people of the world rise up in response
The International Day of Struggle for Peace on October 2nd is approaching, and peace-loving people around the world are actively preparing to greet this day of great demonstrations against warmongers. The International Miners' Federation, the International Textile and Garment Workers' Union, and others have issued declarations calling on workers in these industries around the world to rise up in response to the Day of Peace, immediately organize committees to defend peace, and organize the struggle against a new war. In many cities in France, preparatory committees for the International Day of Peace have been established, and the movement to participate in peace voting is now underway throughout France. The Italian General Confederation of Labor and various democratic groups in Italy have decided to actively organize large-scale demonstrations for the International Day of Peace. In the American continent, the rear of American imperialism, the voice of peace is becoming louder and louder, and the fragility of the foundation of American war policy is becoming clearer and clearer. The Pan-American Peace Conference, which opened on the 5th, successfully opened on the 11th. The meetings of the past week have shown the will of the progressive people of the Americas to oppose warmongers. The conference passed important resolutions and declarations, pointing out that it is necessary to unite against the activities of war profiteers, and called on the people of the Americas to defeat the evil actions of monopoly capitalists who attempt to keep them in a subordinate position. It is worth noting that the American Trade Union Peace Conference is about to be held. Despite the opposition and obstruction of the reactionary leaders of the CIO and the AFL, more than 1,500 local trade union organizations belonging to the CIO and the AFL have expressed their firm support.

The economic situation in the capitalist world is precarious
US imperialism seizes the British market
The Anglo-American-Canadian Tripartite Financial Conference, convened against the backdrop of the increasingly precarious economic situation in the capitalist world, concluded on the 12th after six days of secret negotiations. It was originally said that this conference was to solve the British economic crisis, but it actually became a conference to sacrifice Britain and save the American economic crisis. After the meeting, a communiqué was issued, announcing the so-called "Ten-Point Plan," which showed that the British Labor government had completely opened the doors of Britain and its sphere of influence, allowing American capital to further freely invade, seize British investment markets, seize strategic materials such as oil, rubber, lead, and copper, and allow the Truman Doctrine to extend to India and Egypt in the sterling area. A few days after the meeting, the Labor government announced the devaluation of the pound by one-third. These fully illustrate the Labor government's shameful betrayal of the interests of the British people to Wall Street monopoly capital, and American imperialists have finally ridden on the back of the British Empire. The results of the conference aroused indignation among the broad strata of the British people at the Labor government's policy of betrayal, condemning Bevin and Cripps' agreement with Washington as "a shameful great auction to the gold dollar emperor." The Daily Mail, reflecting the attitude of a large part of the British bourgeoisie, also angrily condemned the Labor government's "last despicable auction" and expressed deep fear and dissatisfaction with the long-term entry of American capital. It can be predicted that the results of the conference will also make Anglo-American contradictions more acute.

　　国际一周
    本月六日，匈牙利国家检察署向人民法庭提出公诉，控诉匈前外长拉伊克及其同谋八人的间谍叛国罪。匈牙利人民法庭已于十六日起开始对这一叛国案实行公开审讯。
    匈国家检察署所提出的长篇起诉书，列举事实，揭发拉伊克等一小撮叛贼，是美帝国主义和铁托叛徒集团合伙雇用的特务，他们被派到匈牙利，改头换面钻进革命队伍，组织间谍网、窃取国家秘密、并从事秘密发展武装、刺杀政府领袖、颠覆政府、篡夺政权等阴谋活动，以便“使铁托集团能以控制匈牙利，从而恢复帝国主义在匈牙利的统治。”起诉书同时暴露美帝国主义及铁托叛徒集团的反革命面目，是多么丑恶和无耻。早在一九四五年初，铁托分子就已变成美帝国主义在人民民主国家从事间谍和颠覆活动的重要工具了。因此，这不仅仅对匈牙利卖国贼奸细的起诉和审判，亦是对美帝国主义及其走狗铁托集团的起诉和审判。
    警惕，再警惕！击碎美帝及铁托间谍阴谋
    匈牙利的这一大叛国案，是在今年五月为匈国家保安机关所破获的。这是匈牙利人民民主制度的又一大胜利，是美帝国主义及其走狗破坏匈牙利人民民主制度的又一大失败。一九四七年五月，匈牙利人民在工人党领导下，曾粉碎了前总理奈基及其集团的叛国阴谋，把处在危急中的人民民主政权拯救出来。今年二月，匈牙利人民又镇压了美帝国主义指使下的红衣主教明曾蒂的叛国阴谋活动，继续巩固了人民民主政权。现在由于拉伊克大叛国案的破获和公诉，人民民主政权更加巩固了，美帝国主义及其走狗们破坏匈牙利的卑劣企图，遭受到粉碎性的打击。然而，我们应该从这一事件获取必要的经验，更加提高警惕，严防美帝国主义及其走狗必然加紧向新中国捣乱的地下活动。
    对其他人民民主国家，美国等帝国主义也纠合铁托叛徒集团进行破坏活动。波兰外交部九日在致铁托政府抗议间谍活动的照会中，揭发了南斯拉夫派遣至波兰的彼特罗维区等官方代表，在波兰收买间谍人员，组织间谍网，窃取情报并进行颠覆性的宣传活动。现在彼特罗维区已被波兰公安机关所逮捕。同时，美英帝国主义除策动希腊保皇法西斯军和铁托军队不断向保加利亚、阿尔巴尼亚边境进行军事侵扰以外，并于八月底在巴黎成立了所谓“自由阿尔巴尼亚委员会”，公开向阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国挑衅。
    迎接国际和平斗争日
  　全世界人民奋起响应
    十月二日国际和平斗争日即将到来，世界爱好和平的人们正在积极准备，以便迎接这个向战争挑拨者举行大示威的日子。国际矿工工会联合会、国际纺织与缝纫业工会等均已发出宣言，号召全世界各该业工人奋起响应和平日，立即组织保卫和平委员会，组织反对新战争的斗争。在法国的许多城市中，国际和平日筹备委员会已纷纷成立，现在参加和平投票的运动正在全法展开。意大利总工会与意国各民主团体，已决定积极组织国际和平日大示威。在美国帝国主义后方的美洲大陆，和平的呼声正愈来愈响亮，美国战争政策基础的脆弱是愈来愈清楚了。五日开幕的全美洲和平大会，已于十一日胜利开幕。近一周的会议表明美洲进步人民反对战争挑拨者的意志。会议通过重要的决议和宣言，指出必须团结反对战争贩子的活动，并号召全美洲人民击败垄断资本家企图使他们处于附属地位的罪恶行动。值得注意的，是美国职工会和平大会即将召开，尽管有产联和劳联反动领袖的反对和阻挠，但已有一千五百余个属于产联与劳联的职工会地方组织已表示坚决拥护。
    资本主义世界经济情势险恶
  　美帝抢夺英国的市场
    在资本主义世界经济形势愈益险恶的情况下召开的美英加三国金融会议，经过六天的秘密谈判之后，已于十二日结束。原来据说这个会议是解救英国经济危机的会议，其实却变成牺牲英国，挽救美国经济危机的会议。会议在结束后发表公报，宣布了所谓“十点计划”，显示英国工党政府已把英国及其势力范围的大门全部打开，让美国资本进一步自由自在地侵入，抢夺英国的投资市场、夺取石油、橡皮、铅、铜等等战略物资，并让杜鲁门主义扩展到英镑区域的印度和埃及等地。工党政府在会议结束后几天，便宣布英镑贬值三分之一。这些充分说明工党政府可耻地出卖英国人民利益给华尔街垄断资本，美帝国主义者终于骑在英帝国背上了。会议的结果引起了英国广大阶层人民对工党政府叛卖政策的愤慨，斥责贝文、克利浦斯与华盛顿的协议为“向金元皇帝可耻的大拍卖”。反映很大部分英国资产阶级态度的每日邮报，也怒责工党政府“最后的卑鄙的拍卖”，并对美国资本将长驱直入而深表恐惧和不满。可以预料，会议的结果也将使英美矛盾愈加尖锐。
