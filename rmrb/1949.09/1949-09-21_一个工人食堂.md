　　A Workers' Cafeteria
    Shang Kai
    In the spring of this year, not long after the liberation of Taiyuan, all the employees were busy repairing machinery, furnaces, and power lines. Because their residences were scattered, they had to travel back and forth every day for meals, wasting time and increasing fatigue. It was even more inconvenient for single workers to cook for themselves, so everyone felt the necessity of organizing a workers' cafeteria.

    The workers clearly remembered that past attempts to organize a cafeteria had failed. But the workers also gained experience: to run a cafeteria well, everyone must contribute ideas and everyone must participate in running it. They first established the principle of "saving money, eating well, convenience, and reasonability." Then they launched a heated discussion among all the employees: some advocated for eating well, some advocated for saving money, some liked to eat rice, some liked to eat wheat-based foods, and some advocated for a mix of coarse and refined grains. Regarding the apportionment of food costs, some advocated for equal distribution, while others advocated for those who eat more paying more, and those who eat less paying less. As for meal times, some said to eat only one meal a day in the cafeteria, while others wanted to be able to come and go freely, without being fixed to a schedule. More and more opinions were raised, and they became more and more complex. How to adapt to these diverse demands? Group meetings concentrated everyone's wisdom, and finally came up with a solution: divide the meals into two servings daily, four types, and twelve portions. To avoid excessive complexity, it was stipulated that rice and millet would be served in the morning, and white flour and corn flour in the afternoon. Each type would be further divided into large, medium, and small portions. Rice or white flour would be 1.2 jin for a large portion, 1.4 liang for a medium portion, and half a jin for a small portion. Millet or corn flour would be 1 jin for a large portion, 11 liang for a medium portion, and 6 liang for a small portion. Besides water and coal subsidized by the public, each person would pay two liang of millet's worth of vegetables per meal, with cabbage, tofu, vermicelli, and tomatoes being regularly varied. But they could also order specific dishes freely.

    Such a complex food system would be a mess without scientific management. After everyone's research, a five-person food committee was selected to be responsible for formulating plans, inspecting food quality and hygiene, soliciting employee opinions, and regularly studying improvements. Under the committee was an administrator, responsible for grain and money receipts and expenditures, and bookkeeping. To simplify procedures and facilitate statistics, planned cooking was implemented. Each person was issued a card each month. The front of the card was divided into 31 columns for the 31 days of the month. Each column was further divided into small squares for the type and amount of rice for morning and afternoon meals, and the back of the card was for a specific menu. Each person pre-registered for meals daily and could freely choose and arbitrarily change according to their own financial situation, appetite, and preferences, by choosing to register for one meal, two meals, or even several days in a row. For example, if you were a person with an average appetite and wanted to eat rice, you could cross out "medium portion" in the "rice" square on the card for that day, and then have the administrator stamp it to exchange it for a medium portion rice meal ticket (the card would be returned after the meal). The administrator would then collect the cards, sort them by category, and compile the total amount of each type of grain needed for the meal, and submit it to the kitchen to cook accordingly. After work, each person would go to the cafeteria with a ticket for the meal. The cooks would then give out the kind and amount listed on the wooden ticket. Because there were accurate statistics in advance, there was very little waste due to insufficient or surplus food.

    The power company issued salaries twice a month, and the cafeteria also settled accounts twice a month. Wages were based on the average market price for three days, while the cafeteria uniformly converted them into millet and collected payment at the trade company's listed price, consistently keeping the food costs below market prices. After collecting the money, the cafeteria administrator would immediately go to the trading company to purchase the various grains needed for the second half of the month at the listed price, so that neither the public nor private parties would suffer losses due to price fluctuations.

    The workers' cafeteria has only been established for three months, but it has achieved satisfactory results. Here is a small statistic: in July, those who ate medium portions of rice and white flour totaled 115 jin of millet; those who ate medium portions of one serving of rice and one of wheat totaled 70 jin of millet; and those who ate medium portions of coarse grains for the whole month totaled more than 50 jin of millet. The lowest apprentice wage is 150 jin of millet. If calculated based on eating medium portions of coarse grains, there would still be more than 90 jin left each month, enough to support a family. The number of people eating in the workers' cafeteria has quickly increased from just over 30 to over 200, accounting for four-fifths of all employees, which is good evidence.

    Instructions
    1.  This material is a report on the work of the Taiyuan trade union presented at this North China Electric Power Cadre Conference. Everyone believes that this cafeteria has been successfully run.
    2.  The last paragraph explains that after the establishment of the cafeteria, workers are often active in the factory, which is convenient for education and strengthens the sense of collectivism. (Attached picture)

### 一个工人食堂

　　一个工人食堂
    商恺
    今年春天，太原解放不久，当时全体职工忙于抢修机炉和线路，因住居分散，每日为吃饭而往返奔跑，浪费时间，增加劳累；而单身工人自己做饭，则更属不便，因此大家都感到有组织工人食堂的必要。
    工人们很清楚的记得：过去组织食堂的办法都失败了。但工人们也获得了经验：要把食堂办好，一定要由大家来出主意，大家来办。他们首先规定了一条“省钱，吃饱，方便，合理”的原则。接着在全体职工中展开了热烈的讨论：有人主张吃好的，有人主张要节省，有人喜欢吃大米，有人喜欢吃面食，也有人主张粗粮细粮调剂着吃；在伙食费的摊派上，有的主张一律均摊，有的则主张吃多摊多，吃少摊少；在吃饭的时间上，有说每天只在食堂吃一顿，也有的要来去自由，不必固定。意见越提越多，也越提越复杂。如何来适应各种要求呢？小组会集中大家的智慧，终于想出了办法，将伙食每天分为两餐，四种，十二份。为避免过于复杂，又规定上午吃大米、小米，下午吃白面、玉米面，每种再分为大、中、小三份。大米或白面是一斤二两为大份，十四两为中份，半斤为小份。小米或玉米面是一斤为大份，十一两为中份，六两为小份。除水煤由公家补助外，每人每餐一律定为二两小米的菜金，白菜，豆腐，粉条，西红柿，经常调剂变换。但另外可自由定菜。
    这样复杂的伙食制度，如果缺乏科学的管理，会搞得一塌糊涂的。经过大家研究，选出一个五人伙食委员会，负责制定计划，检查饭菜质量和卫生，征取职工意见，经常研究改进。下设管理员一人，负责粮款收支，帐目登记。为使手续简明，便于统计，实行有计划的做饭；每人每月发给卡片一张，卡片正面按每月三十一天分为三十一栏，每栏再分许多小格按上午下午两餐划分饭的种类和份量，卡片背面则为特定菜菜单。每人每日预先进行包饭，可根据自己的经济状况，食量大小，胃口爱憎，按照卡片，随便选择，任意变换，包一餐，包两餐，或连包几天均可自由规定。例如：你是个普通食量的人，想吃大米，那么你便可在卡片上当天的一栏里，将“大米”方格内“中份”字样划去，然后交管理员盖章，换取大米中份饭牌一个（卡片于饭后发还）。管理员遂将卡片汇集，分门别类进行统计，将该餐所需各种米面总数，送交伙房，按量做饭。下班后，每人即持牌前往食堂用饭。炊事员即照木牌所列种类份量发给。当食堂成立之初，饭的份量常常不易打得准确，后来炊事员技术逐渐熟练，伸手打饭，迅速准确。因为事先有正确的统计，饭菜不足或剩余浪费的现象是很少的。
    电力公司半月发薪一次，食堂也于半月进行一次结算。发放工资是按三天的平均市价做标准；而食堂则一律折成小米，按贸易公司牌价收款，经常保持使伙食费低于市价。食堂管理员将款项收齐，立即到贸易公司按牌价购买下半月所需各种米面，使公私双方均不致因物价波动而受到损失。
    工人食堂，成立至今也不过三个月的光景，但已获得了令人满意的成绩。这里有一个小小的统计数字：七月份每天吃大米白面中份者，共合小米一百十五斤；每天吃一米一面中份者，合小米七十斤；全月吃粗粮中份者，共合小米五十余斤。而学徒最低工资为一百五十斤小米，如按吃粗粮中份计算，每月尚余九十余斤，可以养家。三个月来在工人食堂吃饭的人，很快的由三十几个人迅速增加到二百多，占全部职工的五分之四，便是很好的证明。
    说明
    一、这个材料是这次华北电业干部会上，太原工会工作中的一个报告，大家认为这个食堂是办成功了。
    二、最后一段，是说明成立食堂后，工人经常在厂内活动便于进行教育、并加强集体观念。（附图片）
