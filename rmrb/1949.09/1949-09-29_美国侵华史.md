　　A History of American Aggression Against China
  　Liu Danian
　　IV. Monopolizing China (Continued from Twenty-Five)
    As soon as Japan announced its surrender, the American aggressors began to reorganize their efforts to eliminate the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). At this time, most areas from Northeast China to Central China were under the control and encirclement of the People's Army. Chiang Kai-shek was still far away on Mount Emei, and it was not only unattainable but also without any excuse for the United States to use him to deal with the people's forces. So the United States devised a plan. First, Chiang Kai-shek sent three telegrams inviting the leader of the Chinese people, Mao Zedong, to Chongqing to "discuss national affairs." Then, the U.S. Ambassador to China, Hurley, personally flew to Yan'an to persuade him to go. According to their idea, Mao Zedong would certainly not meet with Chiang Kai-shek in Chongqing. Then, Chiang Kai-shek could announce: He wanted a "political solution," but the Communist Party had no sincerity for peace and should be suppressed with "military orders" and "political orders." The fact was contrary to the expectations of the American aggressors. On August 25, the Central Committee of the Communist Party issued a peace declaration, and on August 28, Chairman Mao flew to Chongqing, forcing Chiang Kai-shek to accept negotiations. The United States then took advantage of the situation, letting Chiang Kai-shek create complications, bargain, and drag the negotiations from August 28 to October 10, a full month and two weeks. During this time, the United States rapidly mobilized 800,000 troops for Chiang Kai-shek to attack the liberated areas. The United States itself, led by General Wedemeyer, the commander-in-chief of the U.S. forces in China, organized what he boasted as "the largest airlift and sealift in history," transporting Chiang's troops from various remote areas to the front lines of North China and Northeast China. According to President Truman himself, the United States at this time "transported a total of fourteen armies to Central China, Taiwan, North China, and Northeast China, of which three armies were airlifted and eleven armies were transported by sea" (Note: Truman's China policy statement on December 18, 1946). The United States spent as much as $300 million on airlifting Chiang's troops alone. On September 16, the U.S. troops withdrawn during the war against Japan landed in Qingdao, returning to China. Yantai and Weihaiwei, which had been managed by the People's Army, also became landing destinations for U.S. troops. On October 6, Ye Jianying, Chief of Staff of the Eighteenth Group Army, sent a letter to the "U.S. Army Observer Group" in Yan'an, declaring to the U.S. military headquarters:
    "It is difficult to understand the purpose of this landing... It will cause Chinese and foreign people to suspect that the U.S. military is interfering in China's internal affairs..." (Note: Ye Jianying's letter to Ye Dun, October 9, 1945, Jin-Cha-Ji Daily.)
    The U.S. government ignored it. A large number of U.S. troops continued to enter from ports such as Shanghai and Tianjin and spread to major cities such as Nanjing and Beijing, as well as the main railway lines of Hu-Ning and Ping-Sui. At the same time, the U.S. government also implemented "defense assistance" of more than 777.63 million U.S. dollars to Chiang Kai-shek, providing a large amount of military materials. By the time the minutes of the talks between the KMT and the Communist Party were published on December 12, the United States had already completed all arrangements. The next day, October 13, Chiang Kai-shek issued the so-called "Youyuan Telegram," asking his subordinates to "adhere to the spirit of the past resistance war against the liberated areas and the People's Army, follow the bandit suppression manual formulated by Zhongzheng, supervise and encourage their subordinates, work hard to suppress them, and quickly complete the task..." (Note: See Hu Zongnan's telegram to Gao Shuxun.). U.S. troops in China also began to actively fight against the People's Army alone and in coordination with Chiang's troops. In October alone, in Hebei Province:
    On October 1, "After a part of the U.S. military landed in Qinhuangdao, I sent liaison troops to the Haikou to make contact. The U.S. military opened fire on me, and I was forced to defend myself. There was a fierce battle for an hour..." (Note: Jin-Cha-Ji Daily, November 6, 1945.)
    On October 18, "More than 30 fully armed U.S. officers and soldiers surrounded and searched the office of our Jizhong Military Region in the British Concession of Tianjin, arrested five staff members, and disarmed and confiscated four self-defense pistols from the office..." (Note: Zhu De's protest letter to U.S. Commander-in-Chief Wedemeyer, October 24, 1946.)
    On October 20, "U.S. troops in the Qinhuangdao area advanced towards our army's positions in the Ji-Re-Liao liberated area. Although our army advised them to stop, the U.S. troops ignored it and continued to advance forcibly, and forcibly built the railway from Qinhuangdao to Shanhaiguan..." (Note: Ye Jianying, Chief of Staff of the Eighteenth Group Army, October 26, 1945, protest letter to Colonel Ye Dun.)
    On October 30, "A part of the U.S. military, in coordination with the 94th Division of the Kuomintang army, attacked and occupied Haiyang Town in Linyu in our Jidong liberated area. Eighteen guerrillas of our army were disarmed by the U.S. military." (Note: Jin-Cha-Ji Daily, November 6, 1945.)
    On October 31, "A part of the U.S. military and the Kuomintang army attacked Beidaihe from Qinhuangdao and strafed us with heavy machine guns. After suffering heavy losses, our troops were forced to withdraw from Beidaihe." (Note: Ibid.)
    By November, the Chiang's troops attacking the liberated areas continued to be mobilized to one million, and the U.S. Marines, who occupied Chinese territory and participated in Chiang's army operations, also increased to 113,000 (Note: World Knowledge, Volume 15, Issue 2.). The United States obviously wanted to use this rogue tactic of negotiating while advancing to defeat the Communist Party at once. However, Chairman Mao's meeting with Chiang Kai-shek had politically isolated the U.S. running dog, and the U.S. and Chiang's troops on the front line were losing everywhere. In particular, the entire Northeast, which the United States coveted, could not be obtained. It seemed that this step of the United States was not working again.
    On December 15 of the same year, U.S. President Truman formally issued a statement on his policy toward China, stating that "the detailed steps necessary to complete China's political unity should be determined by the Chinese themselves, and believes that any foreign interference in these issues is inappropriate." At the same time, he emphasized that "the existence of autonomous armies, such as the Communist Party's army, is not compatible with China's political unity... it should be effectively integrated into a Chinese National Army" to express its true intention to eliminate the People's Army. At the end of the same month, the U.S. government sent Marshall, who had served as Chief of Staff during the war, as a "special envoy" to China to conduct "mediation." He first personally participated in the formulation of the ceasefire agreement between the KMT and the Communist Party and the five resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference in January 1946. However, the ceasefire order did not include the Northeast, because the United States did not really want Chiang Kai-shek to cease fire, but to freeze the military operations within the customs, let Chiang Kai-shek start fighting from the Northeast first, and then fight towards the customs. Then, the large-scale fighting within the customs would cooperate with the large-scale fighting outside the customs, and finally achieve the goal that "the Communist Party's army" cannot "exist" and "conform" to "China's political unity."

　　美国侵华史
  　刘大年
　　四　独占中国　（续二十五）
    日本投降一宣布，美国侵略者便重新作消灭中共的布置，这时中国从东北到华中，绝大部分地区都在人民军队控制与包围之下，蒋介石还远在峨嵋山上，美国要利用他来对付人民力量，不仅可望而不可即，也毫无借口。于是美国定下一条计策，先由蒋介石三电要请中国人民领袖毛泽东到重庆“商讨国家大计”，然后美国驻华大使赫尔利又亲自飞到延安表示劝驾。按照他们的想法，毛泽东一定不会到重庆与蒋介石会见，那时便可由蒋介石宣布：他是要“政治解决的，但共产党对和平没有诚意，应用“军令”“政令”加以讨伐。事实却和美国侵略者的逆料相反，八月二十五日共产党中央发表和平宣言，二十八日毛主席就飞到重庆，逼得蒋介石不能不接受谈判。美国这又将机就计，让蒋介石横生枝节，讨价还价，把谈判从八月二十八日起拖到十月十日，整整费了一个月又两星期的时间。就在这个时间内，美国迅速让蒋介石动员了八十万军队向解放区进攻。美国本身则由驻华总司令魏德迈组织了他自诩为“相信此为历史上最大一次空运和海运”，把蒋军从各个遥远地区运到华北、东北等作战前线。据后来美总统杜鲁门自己承认，美国此时“运往华中、台湾、华北及东北之军队，共十四军，内三军系空运者，十一军系船运者”（注：一九四六年十二月十八日，杜鲁门对华政策声明）。美国仅空运蒋军一项，所耗费即达三万万美元，九月十六日于对日作战期间撤离的美军，也第一批于青岛登陆，返回中国，早由人民军队管理的烟台、威海卫也成美军登陆目的地。十月六日十八集团军参谋长叶剑英致函延安“美军观察组”，向美军总部声明：
    “难于了解这一登陆目的……将引起中外人士怀疑美军干涉中国内政……。”（注：叶剑英致叶顿函，民国三十四年十月九日，晋察冀日报。）
    美政府置之不理，大批美军从上海、天津等港口陆续侵入，并散布至南京、北京等主要城市，和沪宁、平绥各铁路干线。同时美政府又实行给蒋介石七亿七千七百六十三万余美元的“防务援助”，供给大量军火物资。及十二月十二日国共代表会谈纪要发表，美国也已全部布置停当，第二天，即十月十三日蒋介石发出所谓“酉元电”，要他的部下对解放区与人民军队“务本已往抗战之精神，遵照中正所订剿匪手本，督励所属，努力进剿，迅速完成任务……”（注：见胡宗南致高树勋电。），在华美军也开始单独及协同蒋军对人民军队积极作战，十月一个月内，仅河北一省，就有：
    十月一日，“美军一部在秦皇岛登陆后，我曾派联络部队前往海口联络，美军竟向我开火，我被迫自卫，激战一小时……”（注：民国三十四年十一月六日晋察冀日报。）
    十月十八日，“全副武装之美军官兵三十余人，将本军冀中军区驻天津英租界之办事处包围搜查，捕去工作人员五人，解除及没收办事处自卫手枪四枝……”（注：民国三十五年十月二十四日，朱总司令致美军总司令魏德迈抗议书。）
    十月二十日，“秦皇岛一带美军向冀热辽解放区我军阵地推进，虽经我军劝其停止，然，该美军部队置之不理，仍强行前进，并强行修筑秦皇岛至山海关铁路……”（注：一九四五年十月二十六日，十八集团军叶参谋长致叶顿上校抗议书。）
    十月三十日，“美军一部配合国民党九十四军部队进攻并占领我冀东解放区临愉之海阳镇，我军游击队十八人被美军解除武装。”（注：民国三十四年十一月六日，晋察冀日报。）
    十月三十一日，“美军与国民党军一部，由秦皇岛犯我北戴河，以重机关枪向我扫射，我部受重大损失后被迫退出北戴河。”（注：同前报。）
    至十一月，进攻解放区的蒋军，继续动员到一百万，而占踞中国领土参加蒋军作战的美海军陆战队一种也增加到十一万三千人（注：世界知识，一五卷二期。），美国显然想用这种一面谈判一面进兵的流氓手段，把共产党一下打下去。但毛主席既与蒋介石会见，政治上已使美国走狗陷于孤立，而前线美蒋军队又处处失利，特别是为美国垂涎的整个东北，更无法取得，眼看美国这一步又走不通了。
    同年十二月十五日，美总统杜鲁门正式发表一对华政策声明，表示“完成中国政治团结所必须采取的详细步骤，应由中国人自行制定，并认为任何外国干涉这些问题都是不适当的”，想用些好听词句来欺骗中国人民，同时；又着重指明，“自治性的军队，例如共产党军队之存在，与中国政治统一不相符合……应有效的合成一中国国民军”，来表示出它消灭人民军队的真正企图。同月底，美政府派遣大战中曾任参谋总长的马歇尔为“特使”，来中国进行“调处”，他首先于一九四六年一月亲自参加制订国共停战协定与政治协商会议的五项决议，但停战令并不把东北包括进去，因为美国不是真正要蒋介石停战，而是要把关内军事行动冻结起来，让蒋介石先从东北打起，然后再打向关内，然后用关内大打配合关外大打，最后达到“共产党军”不能“存在”，“符合”于“中国政治统一”的目的。
