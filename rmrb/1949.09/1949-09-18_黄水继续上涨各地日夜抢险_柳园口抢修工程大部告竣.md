Xinhua News Agency, Kaifeng, 16th: The water level of the Yellow River continues to rise. Flood control teams in all regions along the river are working day and night to protect against the rising waters, braving the rain. The water flow at Shanzhou in the upper reaches reached 14,560 cubic meters per second on the 14th. The flow at Huayuankou was 12,750 cubic meters per second on the 13th, with the water level rising to 92.78 meters. The water level below Yuncheng in Pingyuan Province has exceeded the highest level of this summer's flood season. In addition, the water level of the Dawen River in Shandong has risen, flowing directly into the Yellow River, making the situation in the lower reaches even more critical. The dikes in various regions along the river are in danger, with breaches occurring at the Dongbatou dike in Lanfeng and the Liuyuankou dike in Kaifeng. The local people's governments are leading the masses of farmers in actively reinforcing and repairing the dikes. Xing Xuanli, director of the Henan Water Conservancy Bureau, braved the rain to go to Liuyuankou to supervise the workers in the rescue efforts. The repair project there has been largely completed. The county head of Lanfeng County and the county committee of the Chinese Communist Party have also personally gone to the dangerous sections of the river to lead the repair work. All cadres and over a thousand workers at the Dawen River dike are working day and night under the leadership of the commissioner and county head of the area. Nearby counties are gathering one million catties of straw in preparation for any eventuality.
