　　Xinxiang Publicly-Operated Flour Mill
  　Solving Sales and Raw Material Difficulties
  　Establishing a Contract with the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau
    [Xinxiang Electric] The Xinxiang City Publicly-Operated Flour Mill has entered into a contract with the Zhengzhou Longhai-Pinghan Railway Bureau to exchange flour for wheat, resolving the difficulties in flour sales and raw materials. The Xinxiang Flour Mill has 19 mechanical mills. After 40 days of repairs by the staff, nine machines were put back into operation on July 15th, producing 2,300 to 4,400 bags of ordinary flour per day (each bag weighing 44 jin). However, after resuming production, it encountered difficulties in expanding sales and procuring raw materials. The Xinxiang City Enterprise Management Office, based on this situation, actively sought ways to help resolve the problems. In mid-August, a contract was signed with the Longhai-Pinghan Railway Zhengzhou Bureau to exchange flour for wheat. The contract stipulates that the flour mill will supply the bureau with 40,000 to 50,000 bags of flour per month, and the bureau will provide wheat on a monthly basis. This exchange not only solved the difficulties of flour sales and raw materials for the flour mill, but also enabled the railway bureau to spare its employees from the intermediate exploitation of profiteers.

  　与郑州铁路办事处订立合同
    【新乡电】新乡市公营面粉厂与郑州陇海平汉铁路办事处订立了以面粉交换麦子的合同，解决了面粉销路及原料困难。新乡面粉厂共有机器磨十九部，经职工四十天的修复，于七月十五日已有九部机器复工，日产普通面粉两千三百袋到四千四百袋（每袋四十四市斤）。但复工后，就遇了到销路不广和收购原料的困难；新乡市企业管理处根据这一情况，积极设法帮助解决。八月中旬与陇（海）平（汉）铁路郑州办事处订立以面粉换麦子的合同，规定面粉厂每月供给该办事处四万至五万袋面粉，由办事处按月给予麦子。这种交换的结果，不仅面粉厂解决了面粉销路及原料的困难，在铁路办事处方面也可使职工们免除投机商人的中间剥削。
