The United Nations organization is an international organization established after the Second World War to maintain world security and peace. Its establishment underwent many twists and turns and struggles. After numerous discussions and negotiations at the Dumbarton Oaks Conference in 1944, the Yalta Conference in 1945, and the San Francisco Conference in May 1945, this organization for maintaining world security and peace was formally established with the opening of the first UN General Assembly in London in January 1946. It was also decided to hold a general assembly once a year.

The first session of the United Nations General Assembly was held twice. The first began in January 1946 and was convened in London, England. The second was held in New York, USA, in October of the same year. This session formally established the United Nations organization, approved the permanent headquarters of the United Nations, and established the Atomic Energy Control Commission. The Soviet Union put forward proposals such as banning the use of atomic weapons and general disarmament. The democratic camp, represented by the Soviet Union, advocated investigating the stationing of troops by allied countries in the territories of non-enemy countries and the severance of relations by all countries with Franco's Spain, which was adopted after deliberation. The US and Britain attempted to abolish or modify the veto issue during the discussion. The Soviet Union was sincerely determined to implement these proposals, while the US and British imperialism were taking a path contrary to peace. At this UN General Assembly, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit representative shamelessly acted as an echo of its American master. When the "US troops stationed in China" issue was discussed, the Soviet Union condemned the stationing of US troops in China as a violation of the UN Charter. The Chiang Kai-shek bandit representative hurriedly came out to defend its master, forcibly raping Chinese public opinion by saying that the stationing of US troops in China was "with the consent of China (!)". It described Marshall's interference in China's internal affairs as "peacefully resolving China's political disputes," and also expressed shameless "gratitude." Franco's Spain was a notorious fascist element. At the Political and Security Committee of the first UN General Assembly, democratic countries such as the Soviet Union and Poland advocated severing relations with Franco. However, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit representative, in violation of the will of the people of the whole country, obeyed the United States and voted against it. However, the just proposal of "all countries severing relations with Franco" was ultimately passed by a majority of 27 countries including the Soviet Union.

On September 16, 1947, the second UN General Assembly was held in New York.

At the conference, Soviet delegation leader Vyshinsky delivered a speech that shocked the world, exposing the shameless crimes of the US, Britain, and other new warmongers in inciting war. He put forward the famous proposal against warmongers and banning new war propaganda, reiterated the UN General Assembly's condemnation of Franco last year, and severely criticized the reactionary behavior of US and British imperialism in obstructing the implementation of the General Assembly's resolutions. In addition, the Soviet Union's proposal on Palestine was passed, ending British rule in Palestine. However, at this session of the UN General Assembly, the US ignored the protests of the Soviet Union and other democratic countries and established illegal organizations that undermined the United Nations, such as the "Little General Assembly," the "Temporary Committee on Korea," and the Balkan Special Committee. At this session of the General Assembly, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit representative's slavish behavior emerged one after another. The "veto power" is the core part of the United Nations and embodies the principle of unanimity among the great powers. However, US and British imperialism opposed the veto power, so the Chiang Kai-shek bandit representative Wang Shijie also attempted to shirk responsibility for its American master's destruction of the veto power, using "excessive use of the veto power" as a reason. On October 2, he further proposed a reactionary proposal to amend the veto power for its American master, shamelessly advocating that "the five permanent members of the Security Council, individually or collectively, shall waive the use of the veto power on all procedural issues arising from Chapter VI of the Charter concerning the peaceful settlement of disputes."

US and British imperialism aided the Greek reactionaries and massacred the Greek people, which was unanimously opposed by progressive public opinion around the world. However, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit representative Jiang Tingfu absurdly said that "the UN Charter or international law does not stipulate a prohibition on one government assisting another government or accepting assistance from another government" to whitewash its American master. On October 15, he also "conditionally" supported the suggestion of its American master to establish a "Temporary Committee of the General Assembly" (i.e., the "Little General Assembly").

On October 1, Vyshinsky severely criticized warmonger Bullitt's warmongering preaching in "Life" magazine at the UN General Assembly. Bullitt wanted the US government to oppose the Chinese workers and peasants, arrogantly demanded interference in China's internal affairs, and clamored for aiding Chiang Kai-shek to massacre the Chinese people. Vyshinsky's criticism was necessary for the people of the world, especially the Chinese people, but the Chiang Kai-shek bandit representative Gu Weijun shamelessly defended the American war peddler Bullitt in public. He expressed tears of gratitude for Bullitt's remarks in "Life" magazine calling for war against the Chinese people, and applauded "admiring Bullitt's courage." He also used defending "freedom of speech" as a reason to reject the Soviet Union's proposal to stop war propaganda. On the Korean issue, which should have been handled directly by the Soviet Union and the United States, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit representative followed its American master in sabotaging the Moscow Agreement and advocated that the UN General Assembly should resolve it.

On the Indonesian issue, the Soviet representative mainly requested that the Security Council establish a committee to monitor the implementation of the ceasefire. In order to curry favor with its American master, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit representative and the Australian representative proposed that the consuls general of the Security Council member states stationed in Batavia report the ceasefire situation to the Security Council. There were only five consuls in Batavia from the US, Britain, France, China (Chiang Kai-shek), and Switzerland. Except for Switzerland, which was a non-member country, the rest all maintained the interests of the Dutch imperialism. Therefore, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit representative's new conspiracy to help the American imperialists continue to invade the Indonesian people was ultimately exposed by the Soviet Union and despised by the people of all countries.

The Third UN General Assembly was held in two parts, on September 21, 1948 in Paris and on April 5, 1949 in New York. Under the pressure of the democratic forces led by the Soviet Union, the conference adopted suggestions on major powers restoring and establishing lasting peace, and reiterated the principle of international cooperation declared in the Yalta Agreement. It rejected the US lackey Argentina's proposal to broadly restrict the veto power, the British and American proposal to abolish the severance of relations with Franco, and the Bevin-Sforza plan to divide Italy's colonies. However, US and British imperialism manipulated its "majority voting machine" to reject the Soviet Union's re-proposed proposals to ban atomic weapons and reduce the military strength of the five powers by one-third, but used the reactionary "Baruch Plan" as the basis for the international control of atomic energy plan. It also passed proposals to extend the "Balkan Committee" and the "Little General Assembly" for another year, and recognized the South Korean Lee Seung-man puppet government as the legitimate government of Korea. It delayed handling the Italian colonial issue and transferred the Indonesian issue to this session for discussion, and passed a resolution to establish a fourteen-nation special committee to study the establishment of a UN guard force to establish reactionary armed forces. When the United Nations Korean Committee—an illegal group that split Korea—was established, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit representative Wang Shijie praised it vigorously and praised the notorious United Nations Indonesia Mediation Committee, which further enslaved the Indonesian people, and followed the American master in shouting against the principle of unanimity among the great powers and against the proposal to reduce the military strength of the five powers by one-third. Using the excuse that he needed police force to suppress the Chinese people's liberation movement at the time, he begged for the assistance of the American master and brazenly said, "The Chinese issue is not to reduce armaments but to increase armaments." The Chiang Kai-shek bandit representative's slavish ugliness was fully displayed.

In the struggles between democratic and anti-democratic countries in past UN General Assemblies, the Soviet Union has won significant victories politically and morally. In every conference, the Soviet Union has shown that it is a firm supporter of democracy and peace, while the various destructive behaviors of US imperialism are exposing it as an enemy of peace. At this session of the General Assembly (convened on the 21st), the Chiang Kai-shek bandit representative shamelessly issued slanderous remarks against the Soviet Union, making a last-ditch struggle for its doomed fate. Anyone with a little common sense understands that this clamor by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit representative is its final wail.

　　历届联合国会议上国民党代表奴才相
    本报时事资料组联合国组织是第二次世界大战后，维持世界安全与和平的一个国际组织机构。它的建立，曾经历了许多波折与斗争。经过一九四四年敦巴顿会议、一九四五年雅尔达会议及一九四五年五月旧金山会议的多番讨论与协商，到一九四六年一月第一届伦敦联合国大会的开幕，这个维持世界安全和平的机构，才正式成立。并决定了每年举行一次大会。
    第一届联合国大会开了两次。第一次开始于一九四六年一月，召集于英国伦敦。第二次同年十月在美国纽约召开。这届大会正式建立了联合国机构，通过联合国永久会址，成立原子能管制委员会。并由苏联提出了禁止使用原子武器，普遍裁军等议案。由苏联代表的民主阵营主张调查盟国在非敌国领土驻军及各国与西班牙佛朗哥绝交等议案，当经通过。否决权问题，美英企图取消或修改在讨论中，苏联是衷心坚持这些议案的实行，而美英帝国主义却走着与和平相反的路。蒋匪代表在这一次联合国大会，无耻地作了其美国主子的应声虫。当讨论到“美军驻华”问题时，苏联谴责美军驻华是违反联合国宪章，蒋匪代表急忙出来为其主子辩论，强奸中国民意说美军驻华是“经中国（？）之同意”。把马歇尔来华干涉中国内政说成是“以和平解决了中国政治纠纷”，还表示了无耻的“感激”。佛朗哥西班牙是臭名远扬的法西斯分子，一届联大政治安全委员会上，苏波等民主国家都主张与佛朗哥断绝关系。但蒋匪代表违反全国人民意志，一味听命美国，竟投了反对票，但结果“各国与佛朗哥断绝关系”的正义议案终以苏联等二十七个国家以多数通过了。
    一九四七年九月十六日，第二届联合国大会在纽约举行。
    大会上苏联代表团长维辛斯基发表了轰动全世界的演说，揭露美英等新战争贩子煽动战争的无耻罪行，提出了有名的反对战争贩子及取缔新战争宣传的建议，重申去年联大谴责佛朗哥的决议，对美英帝国主义阻挠大会决议执行的反动行为予以痛斥。另外通过了苏联关于巴勒斯坦的建议，结束英国在巴勒斯坦的委任统治。但这一届联大会上美帝无视苏联及民主国家的抗议，竟成立“小型联大”、“朝鲜临时委员会”及巴尔干特别委员会等破坏联合国的非法组织。在这一届大会上，蒋匪代表的奴才相层出不穷。“否决权”是联合国核心部分，是体现大国一致的原则。但是美英帝国主义反对否决权，于是蒋匪代表王世杰也以“否决权之过度使用”为理由，企图替美国主子破坏否决权卸责。十月二日他更进一步为美国主子提出修改否决权的反动议案，无耻地主张“安理会五常任理事国个别或全体对于所有因关于争端之和平解决之宪章第六章引起的程序问题，均放弃援用否决权。”
    美英帝国主义援助希腊反动派，屠杀希腊人民，为全世界进步舆论一致反对，但蒋匪代表蒋廷黻竟荒谬谓“联合国宪章或国际法未规定禁止此一政府援助彼一政府，或接受他政府之援助”来为其美国主子洗刷。十月十五日又“有条件”地支持其美国主子所提成立“联大临时委员会”（即“小型联大”）的建议。
    十月一日维辛斯基在联合国大会上痛斥战争贩子布立特在“生活”杂志上的好战的说教。布立特要美国政府反对中国工农，狂妄地要求干涉中国内政，叫嚣援蒋屠杀中国人民。维辛斯基的痛斥是为世界人民尤为中国人民感到必要，而蒋匪代表顾维钧厚颜寡耻地公开为美国战贩布立特辩护。对布立特在“生活”杂志上号召对中国人民作战的言论，表示感激涕零，拍手“钦佩布立特的勇气”。还以保卫“言论自由”作为拒绝苏联所提关于制止战争宣传的建议。而应由苏美直接处理的朝鲜问题，蒋匪代表则尾随其美国主子破坏莫斯科协定，主张由联合国大会解决。
    在印尼问题上，苏联代表主力由安理会成立委员会监视停战实施的情形。蒋匪代表为了向美国主子献媚，即与澳代表提出安理会会员国驻巴城总领事向安理会报告停战的情形。在巴城仅有美、英、法、中（蒋）、瑞士五国领事，除瑞士是非会员国外，其余都是维护荷帝国主义的利益，因此蒋匪代表此一帮助美帮帝国主义继续侵略印尼人民的新阴谋，终为苏联所揭破，为各国人民所不齿。
    第三届联大分两次举行，分别在一九四八年九月二十一日于巴黎及一九四九年四月五日于纽约举行。大会在苏联为首的民主力量压力下，通过了各大国恢复并建立持久和平的建议，重申雅尔达协定所宣告的国际合作原则。否决了美走狗阿根廷提出的广泛限制否决权之议案及英美的废除与佛朗哥断绝关系的议案及企图分割意大利殖民地的贝文——史佛卓计划。但是美英帝国主义操纵其“多数投票机器”否决了苏联重新提出的禁止原子武器与五强裁军三分之一的议案，却以反动的“巴鲁区计划”为国际管制原子能计划基础。又通过了把“巴尔干委员会”及“小型联大”延长一年的议案，并承认南韩李承晚伪政府为朝鲜合法政府。拖延处理意大利殖民地问题及印尼问题移交这届大会讨论，并通过成立十四国特别委员研究建立联合国警卫队问题的决议，以建立反动武装。当联合国朝鲜委员会——分裂朝鲜的非法团体成立后，蒋匪代表王世杰极力称赞，并颂扬臭名昭彰的进一步奴役印尼人民的联合国印尼调处委员会，跟在美国主子后面呐喊反对大国一致原则及反对五强裁军三分之一的议案。借口当时他需要警察兵力镇压中国人民的解放运动，乞求美国主子的援助，大言不惭说“中国问题不是缩减军备而是增加军备。”蒋匪代表之奴才丑相表现十足。
    在过去历届联合国大会民主与反民主国家斗争中，苏联在政治上、道义上赢得了显著的胜利。苏联在每次大会中都表现出他是民主与和平的坚决拥护者，而美帝国主义的各种破坏行为正暴露出它是和平的敌人。在这一届联大会上（二十一日召开），蒋匪代表又无耻地发出诽谤苏联的言论，为其灭亡的命运作垂死挣扎，稍有常识的人们都明白，蒋匪代表的这一叫嚣，已是它最后一次的哀鸣了。
