　　The Communist Party's Great Ideological Weapon
    —— On the Fortieth Anniversary of Lenin's "Materialism and Empirio-criticism"
    By M. Miding, Member of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, translated by Zifan

    (I)
    Lenin's "Materialism and Empirio-criticism," published in May 1909, belongs to the ranks of the immortal creations of Marxist science.
    Lenin's work still retains its scientific and ideological value to this day. None of Lenin's scientific propositions have become obsolete; moreover, they are now gaining a special active force in the struggle against various anti-scientific and reactionary theories in the fields of philosophy, sociology, natural science, and political science.
    The Machist idealist philosophy, which became widely popular in Russia during the reactionary period after the Russian Revolution of 1905-07, became the direct motive for Lenin's writing of this book.
    The characteristic and danger of this philosophy lay in its camouflage with Marxist phrases and its attack on Marxism and its philosophy by citing the latest discoveries in natural science.
    Lenin studied all the trends of philosophical thought in Russia and the West, and deeply studied the situation of contemporary natural science. Therefore, he was able to expose Machist philosophy as a modern form of idealism and prove its unfoundedness.
    In "Materialism and Empirio-criticism," Lenin fiercely attacked idealism, exposed its reactionary and unfounded nature from the perspective of modern science, especially natural science, and pointed out that Machism was the most vicious enemy of the working class and socialism. In this work, Lenin enriched Marxism with his analysis of the international working class movement in the era of imperialism, and enriched Marxist philosophy with his conclusions on modern natural science.
    Lenin's "Materialism and Empirio-criticism" further developed Marxist philosophy and marked a new and higher stage in the philosophical development of modern science.
    Comrade Stalin gave a classic description of the role and significance of Lenin's "Materialism and Empirio-criticism" in his book "Foundations of Leninism." Stalin wrote: "To summarize the most important scientific contributions from Engels to Lenin based on materialist philosophy, and to criticize in all aspects the anti-materialist factions among Marxists, was a major task; and it was none other than Lenin who undertook to accomplish this task – this can be regarded as the most obvious manifestation of Lenin's extreme emphasis on theory. Engels said: 'Materialism should take on new forms along with every new great discovery.' As is well known: it was none other than Lenin who, in his masterpiece 'Materialism and Empirio-criticism,' fulfilled this task for his time."
    Lenin's "Materialism and Empirio-criticism" is the theoretical foundation of the Bolshevik Party. In this work, Lenin opposed the enemies of Marxism, defended the theoretical foundation of communism—dialectical materialism, and further developed this theory according to new historical conditions.
    This philosophical masterpiece occupies a glorious position among Lenin's works that paved the way for a new type of Marxism and played a decisive role.

    (II)
    As is well known, Mach and Avenarius were the founders of the Machist philosophical thought in the 1870s and 1880s. Mach's philosophy represents a typical school of subjective idealist philosophy, and its basic proposition can be briefly described as: the world is the synthesis of my (subjective) sensations.
    This philosophy has no new ideas. As Lenin pointed out in his works, it merely repeats the old views of the subjective idealists of Berkeley (18th century) and Fichte (19th century) and the agnosticism of Kant, which had long been refuted. Lenin, with true Bolshevik enthusiasm and amazing scientific power, proved the worthlessness of these idealist "theories," proved their harmfulness, and their servility before the bourgeoisie.
    In "Materialism and Empirio-criticism," Lenin ridiculed the hypocritical assertions of the Machists, who claimed that their philosophy was "the philosophy of modern natural science." Lenin pointed out that, on the contrary, their philosophy actually ran counter to contemporary science, was a idealistic distortion of the latest discoveries in physics, and directly served obscurantism.
    Mach at that time opposed social democracy and slanderously asserted (in this regard, he surpassed all later reactionaries in science) that the result of socialism would be slavery, and that communism would lead to egalitarianism in meeting social and personal needs.
    Lenin pointed out the characteristics of Machist sociological views and exposed their true social essence. He wrote that their theories expressed "the infinite stupidity of the philistines, who smugly reiterate the most stale rubbish under the cover of a 'new,' 'empirio-critical' system and jargon... Such is the case in epistemology, and such is the case in sociology—the same reactionary content under the same pompous signboard."
    It is important to pay attention to Austro-Marxism. As is well known, "Austro-Marxism shamefully betrayed the working class and an ideology of struggle for socialism, and its foundation in the realm of philosophy was Machism. Most of the 'theorists' of Austro-Marxism either fully supported Machist arguments (such as F. Adler) or attempted to combine Machism with neo-Kantianism (such as Max Adler, Otto Bauer, and K. Renner).
    Today's right-wing socialists, like the Austro-Marxists and other Marxist revisionists in the camp of Western social democracy, are also placing themselves on the decaying subjective idealist philosophical foundation of Machism in one way or another in their struggle against Marxism-Leninism and against communism.
    The strength and greatness of "Materialism and Empirio-criticism" lie in the fact that Lenin argued for the basic propositions of Marxist philosophy—philosophical materialism, dialectics, and historical materialism—based on the revolutionary experience of the contemporary proletariat and with scientific arguments and culture, thereby giving Marxist philosophy a modern form and enabling the Party to understand the new laws of the current era.
    Lenin, from the height of modern science and revolutionary experience, exposed the stupidity and reactionary essence of all attempts to refute Marxism.
    Comrade Stalin, inheriting the classic path of Marxist philosophy, further developed Lenin's brilliant thought under new conditions. The entire progress of the working-class struggle and the progress of science fully confirmed the scientific power of Marxist philosophy, as stated and demonstrated in "Materialism and Empirio-criticism."
    Lenin, with the greatest scientific precision, pointed out the development process of philosophy in the bourgeois world in the era of imperialism. He criticized and exposed all new types of idealism. These idealisms were just beginning to emerge when Marx and Engels were alive, but flourished in this new historical era.
    Machism, neo-Kantianism, empirio-criticism, empirio-symbolism, immanent philosophy, pragmatism, positivism, idealism in physics, etc.—all these modern idealist schools are spreading in the bourgeois world in this new era, and are still being regarded as something "new" in philosophy today.
    Lenin, following the path of the philosophical system of Marx and Engels, severely criticized these schools.
    Since its publication, Lenin's book has gained great international significance. Although written forty years ago, every evaluation, every argument, and every description of the reactionary nature of idealism in the book is as if it were written today.
    As is well known, the center of philosophical obscurantism and anti-Marxism has now shifted to the United States and Britain. Modern bourgeois philosophy is now serving Anglo-American imperialism. An analysis of the current state of bourgeois philosophy clearly confirms the decline, degeneration, and corruption of bourgeois thought. Denying objective truth, belittling the importance of science and scientific laws, falsely claiming that reason and science are useless, and religious revelations in various philosophical disguises—this is the face of bourgeois philosophy today. Its direct social task is to defend the bourgeois order, bourgeois "democracy," reject materialism, and spread a thick ideological smoke screen to confuse those with simple understanding.
    Lenin's book exposes various forms of bourgeois thought. It is a powerful ideological weapon in the proletariat's party's struggle against idealism and in defending the Marxist worldview.

    (III)
    "Materialism and Empirio-criticism" is of great significance in providing a materialist dialectical answer to the recent fields of natural science, especially physics. As is well known, after Marx and Engels, until the publication of Lenin's book, there was a real revolution in physics, a revolution that demanded a re-evaluation of old ideas and even the theoretical foundation of physics. The discovery of the electronic structure of matter, the collapse of the old concept of the unchanging characteristics of matter studied by old physics, and the discovery of new laws in the concept of the microcosm—this torrent of discoveries that had a great impact on physicists was used by reactionary figures in scientific idealism to engage in the anti-materialist movement. They began to "prove" that "matter has disappeared," "mass has disappeared," and only "energy" is preserved, massless energy, that is, non-material energy. In this case, the collapse of materialism was proven.
    When preparing to write "Materialism and Empirio-criticism," Lenin had carefully studied the new discoveries in natural science and philosophy. Lenin pointed out that there was a crisis in bourgeois science. He wrote: "The essence of the crisis in modern physics lies in the bankruptcy of old laws and fundamental principles, in denying that objective reality exists outside the will, that is, replacing materialism with idealism and agnosticism."
    Lenin pointed out that scientists who do not understand natural dialectics believe that theories are only symbols, signs, and marks, and deny the existence of objective reality independent of the will.
    However, Lenin not only diagnosed the essence of the pathological condition of bourgeois science, but he also pointed out the way out. He gave a philosophical answer to all the new arguments in the field of natural science. He pointed out that the existence of an objective material world outside the will is the starting point of materialism. No discovery in the field of natural science can go beyond this point. On the contrary, it can only confirm it. Any scientist who studies the structure of matter must study this objective world.
    Lenin pointed out that dialectical materialism does not hinder the in-depth study of natural laws, nor does it hinder the exploration of the "secrets" of matter structure. Lenin pointed out that dialectical materialism requires only one thing from natural scientists: that scientists should understand that they are studying the objective world, and that the objective world is the material existence independent of the will. The collapse of obsolete laws and concepts about this world does not mean the collapse of our knowledge of this world. On the contrary, it proves the power of human knowledge.
    Lenin's "Materialism and Empirio-criticism" is the key to all the new and emerging issues in the theory of natural science related to the latest achievements of modern science. Modern science has made greater progress in the knowledge of the structure of matter and its laws. The knowledge and practical application of atomic energy, the study of cosmic rays, and new discoveries in chemistry and biology have all confirmed Lenin's brilliant prediction of the direction of natural science development. All these complex phenomena can only be correctly evaluated from the philosophical standpoint developed in "Materialism and Empirio-criticism." This book has long become a manual for those Soviet scientists engaged in the study of nature. The beneficial influence of dialectical materialism on science is very evident in the biological theories of Michurin and Lysenko.

    (IV)
    "Materialism and Empirio-criticism" is a model of militant Bolshevik partisanship in philosophy.
    Throughout the book, Lenin very clearly suggested the struggle between two basic factions in philosophy—materialism and idealism. He lashed out at all those who wanted to "transcend" the "one-sidedness" of materialism and idealism, and declared some "new faction of philosophy," calling this "new faction" by the beautiful name of positivism, realism, etc. Lenin called this philosophical trickery "professorial deception."
    With true Bolshevik enthusiasm, Lenin refuted all the "despicable" middle-of-the-road philosophical factions that attempted to confuse the tendencies of materialism and idealism on every issue. Lenin pointed out with extraordinary depth how harmful, worthless, and fruitless the attempt to put aside the two basic factions in philosophy was.
    Every page of this great work reveals the Bolshevik principled stand and the irreconcilable struggle against bourgeois thought, no matter how concealed and decorated this thought is in form.
    Comrade Stalin advanced Lenin's great thought in his genius study of the issues of dialectical materialism and historical materialism. Comrade Stalin wrote that dialectical materialism is the worldview of the Bolshevik Party. This assertion is a direct inheritance and development of Lenin's thought on the partisanship of philosophy, and it brilliantly demonstrates the scientific and partisan significance of our philosophy.
    "Materialism and Empirio-criticism" not only provides a key for correctly understanding the world, but also enables people to understand the world's revolutionary transformation. It instills in the reader's heart an infinite hostility to idealism, metaphysics, and obscurantism. Today, forty years since the first publication of this work, its great thought shines more brightly than before.
    "Materialism and Empirio-criticism" is one of those scientific works that cannot be "prohibited" or "excluded." The revolutionary philosophy of Marxism-Leninism has an irresistible appeal. Wherever revolutionary thought is discovered, whenever a scientific idea seeks to penetrate the essence of social and natural laws, there can be no progress without the philosophy of Marxism, because Marxism is in line with the requirements of modern science and is the only thorough scientific philosophy.
    As the years go by, Lenin's classic philosophical work is increasingly penetrating into various countries. And this is not difficult to understand. In imperialist countries, especially in the United States and Britain, which have become centers of modern reaction and obscurantism, many progressive people are based on the modern scientific worldview. Consistency in science and the struggle for a progressive worldview inevitably leads to dialectical materialism and the philosophy of Marxism-Leninism. Lenin's book is a valuable source for mastering the most progressive and most scientific modern worldview, and a source for resolutely struggling against all kinds of modern reactionary philosophical thoughts.
    Therefore, "Materialism and Empirio-criticism" is a powerful weapon for the Communist Parties of all countries in their struggle against imperialism and against all kinds of capitalist enslavement.
    In the people's democratic countries, the struggle against the bourgeois worldview is becoming more and more intense. Because this worldview is still very firm in the minds of intellectuals, and at the same time, this bourgeois worldview is often expressed in some works of natural science, history, and political economy, in university lectures or sermons.
    The further success of socialist construction will increasingly depend on the extent and resoluteness to which intellectuals and advanced workers and peasants get rid of the bourgeois worldview.
    It must be remembered: As the experience of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) indicates, ideological and philosophical struggle is one of the forms of class struggle to achieve socialism.
    That is why, in the people's democratic countries, we should now earnestly engage in ideological and philosophical "research," as Lenin said at the time.
    Lenin's genius work "Materialism and Empirio-criticism" will be invaluable to the Marxist party in its great and arduous cause.

　　共产党的伟大的思想武器
    ——为列宁底“唯物论与经验批判论”一书四十年而作
    苏联科学院会员  Ｍ·米丁著  子凡译
    （一）
    列宁底“唯物论与经验批判论”一书，出版于一九○九年五月，属于马克思主义科学底不朽创作之列。
    列宁底这部著作，至今仍保有其科学上和思想上的价值。列宁底科学论题中，不仅没有一个是陈旧了，而且现今又在与哲学、社会学、自然科学及政治学领域中各种反科学的、反动的理论作斗争中，获得了一种特殊的主动的力量。
    在一九○五—○七年俄国革命后的反动时期，马赫主义的唯心论哲学，在俄国曾广泛地流行起来，这种哲学就成了列宁写作这本书底直接动机。
    这种哲学底特征和危险，就在于用马克思主义底词句作掩护，并引证自然科学上的最新发现，向马克思主义及其哲学进攻。
    列宁研究了俄国和西方各国哲学思想底一切思潮，深刻地研究了当代自然科学的情况，因此能把马赫主义哲学，作为唯心论底一种现代形式，揭露了它底毫无根据。
    列宁在“唯物论与经验批判论”中，痛击了唯心论，以现代科学，尤其是自然科学的观点，揭穿了它的反动性和毫无根据，同时指出马赫主义是工人阶级和社会主义最凶恶的敌人。在这个著作中，列宁以对帝国主义时期的国际工人阶级运动底分析，丰富了马克思主义，并以他对现代自然科学底结论，丰富了马克思主义底哲学。
    列宁底“唯物论与经验批判论”，进一步发展了马克思主义底哲学，在现代科学底哲学发展上，它标志了一个新的、更高的阶段。
    斯大林同志在“列宁主义底基础”一书中，曾对列宁底“唯物论与经验批判论”底作用和意义，作了一个经典的描述。斯大林写道：“依据唯物论的哲学，把从恩格斯到列宁这时期最重要的科学贡献综合起来，并从各方面去批评马克思主义者中反唯物论的派别，这是一个最大的任务；而担任实现这个任务的，不是别人，却正是列宁——这件事可算是列宁异常重视理论的最明显表现。恩格斯说：‘唯物论应当随同每一个新的伟大发现而采取新的形式’。如众周知：不是别人，而正是列宁，在‘唯物论与经验批判论’这本杰作里面，为自己的时代实现了这个任务”。
    列宁底“唯物论与经验批判论”，是布尔什维克党的理论基础。在这本著作中，列宁反对马克思主义底敌人，维护共产主义底理论基础——辩证唯物论，并根据新的历史条件，进一步发展了它这种理论。
    在新型马克思主义铺设道路，并占有决定性作用的列宁著作中，这本哲学巨著，占有着一席光荣的地位。
    （二）
    如所周知，马赫和阿芬那流斯（Ａｖｅｎａｒｉｕｓ），是上一世纪七十年代和八十年代中，马赫派哲学思潮底创始人。马赫哲学代表了典型的主观唯心论的哲学学派，其基本论题可以简述为：世界是我底（主观的）感觉底综合。
    这种哲学没有什么新的创见，正如列宁在他的著作中指出的，它仅仅重复了早已被驳倒了的马克莱（Ｂｅｒｋｅｌｅｙ，十八世纪）和费希特（Ｆｉｃｈｔｅ，十九世纪）底主观唯心论派和康德底不可知论底旧观点。列宁以真正的布尔什维克的热情，和惊人的科学威力，证明了这些唯心论的“理论”底毫无价值，证明了它们的危害性和在资产阶级面前的卑躬屈节。
    在“唯物论与经验批判论”中，列宁嘲笑了马赫派底虚伪论断，他们居然称他们底哲学是“现代自然科学底哲学”。列宁指出，恰好相反，他们底哲学实际上是与当代科学背道而驰，是对物理学最新发现底一种唯心论的歪曲，并直接地服役于蒙昧主义。
    马赫在当时曾反对社会民主主义，毁谤地断言（在这点上，他超过了科学方面后来的一切反动派）社会主义的结果将成为奴隶制度，共产主义在满足社会的和个人的需要上，将导向平均主义。
    列宁指出马赫派社会学观点底特征，同时揭露了他们真正的社会本质。他写道：他们底理论表现了“俗物底无限愚蠢，这些家伙在一种‘新的’，‘经验批判的’体系和专门术语底掩盖之下，沾沾自喜地来重述最陈腐的废屑……在认识论上如此，在社会学上也如此——在同样堂皇的招牌下有着同样反动的内容。”
    注意奥国马克思主义是很重要的。如所周知，“奥国马克思主义是可耻的背叛了工人阶级，背叛了为社会主义而斗争底一种思想意识，它在哲学范围里的基础，就是马赫主义。奥国马克思主义底大部‘理论家们’，有的全力支持马赫派的论点（如阿得勒Ｆ．Ａｄｌｅｒ）或是企图把马赫主义与新康德主义结合起来（如马克·阿得勒，Ｍａｘ　Ａｄｌｅｒ，奥托·鲍尔Ｏｔｔｏ　Ｂａｕｅｒ，伦纳尔Ｋ．Ｒｅｎｎｅｒ）。
    今天的右派社会主义者们，和奥国马克思主义者和其他西方社会民主主义阵营中的马克思主义底修正主义者们一样，在他们反对马列主义，反对共产主义底斗争中，也是用这个或那个方式，把他们自己放在马赫主义底腐朽的主观唯心论的哲学基础上。
    “唯物论与经验批判论”的力量和伟大处，就是列宁把马克思主义哲学底基本论题——哲学上的唯物论，辩证法和历史唯物论——用当代无产阶级底革命经验为根据，以科学论据及文化为根据，加以论证，由是而给予马克思主义哲学以现代的形式，并使党能够认识当前时代底新规律。
    列宁从现代科学和革命经验底高度，揭穿了一切驳倒马克思主义的企图的愚蠢和反动的本质。
    斯大林同志承继着马克思主义哲学底经典路线，在新的条件下进一步发展了列宁底光辉思想。工人阶级斗争底整个进展和科学底进步，充分证实了马克思主义哲学的科学力量，象在“唯物论与经验批判论”中所陈述和论证的一样。
    列宁以最大的科学精确性，指出了在帝国主义时代的资产阶级世界里哲学的发展过程。他批判并揭露了一切新型的唯心论。这些唯心论，是在马克思和恩格斯在世时才刚刚产生，而在这个新的历史时代才繁荣起来的。
    马赫主义，新康德主义，经验批判主义，经验象征主义，内在论派哲学，实用主义，实证论，物理学上的唯心论等等——这一切近代唯心论的流派，都在这新时代中的资产阶级世界里蔓延着，直到今天还被当作哲学的什么“新奇”的东西。
    列宁遵循着马克思和恩格斯底哲学体系道路，严厉地批判了这些流派。
    列宁这本书出版以来，已获得了巨大的国际意义。虽然写于四十年以前，但书中对于唯心论的反动性所作的每一估价，每一论证，每一描述，就好象它是今天才写成的一样。
    如所周知，哲学的蒙昧主义和反马克思主义底中心，现在已经转移到了美国和英国。现代资产阶级的哲学，是专为英美帝国主义而服役的了。资产阶级哲学现状底分析，显明地证实了资产阶级思想底衰颓、堕落和腐败。否定客观真理，轻视科学和科学法则底重要性，妄言理性与科学无用，以及各种各样哲学伪装着的宗教启示——这就是今天资产阶级哲学所呈现的书面。它直接的社会任务就是保卫资产阶级的秩序，资产阶级的“民主”，排斥唯物论，散布一种浓厚的思想烟幕，来迷惑那些认识简单的人。
    列宁这本书，揭露了资产阶级思想底各种形式，它在无产阶级政党反对唯心论的斗争中，在保卫马克思主义的世界观中，是一个强有力的思想武器。
    （三）
    “唯物论与经验批判论”在给予晚近的自然科学领域，特别是物理学领域中，以唯物辩证的解答上，是具有伟大的意义的。如所周知，在马克思和恩格斯之后，一直到列宁这本著作问世的时候，在物理学上，经过了一次真正的革命，一个要求对旧有观念，甚至物理学的理论基础重新估价的革命。物质底电子结构底发现，旧物理学所专研的关于物质不变的特性的旧观念底崩溃，和小宇宙底概念中新法则底发现——这个给了物理学家许多影响的发现底洪流，被科学上的唯心论反动派利用来从事反对唯物论的运动。他们开始“证明”“物质消灭了”，“质量消灭了”，只有“能”保存着，无质量的能，那就是说，非物质的能，既然如此，唯物论底崩溃就得到证明了。
    当准备写“唯物论与经验批判论”的时候，列宁曾详细研究过自然科学和哲学范围里的新发现。列宁指出其中存在着资产阶级科学底危机。他写道：“近代物理学危机底本质，就在于旧法则与基本原则底破产，在于否认客观现实存在于意志之外，那就是，以唯心论和不可知论来代替唯物论。”
    列宁指出不懂得自然辩证法的科学家们认为理论只是象征、符号和标志一样，并且否认客观现实底存在独立于意志之外。
    可是，列宁不但诊断了资产阶级科学底病象底本质，他还指明了出路。他给自然科学范围里的所有新论据以哲学的解答。他指出存在于意志之外的客观的物质世界底存在，是唯物论底出发点。在自然科学范围里没有任何发现能超出这一点。相反的，却只能证实它。任何研究物质构造的科学家，都必须研究这个客观世界。
    列宁指出，辩证唯物论一点也不妨碍对自然法则作精深的研究，也不阻挡探究物质构造底“秘密”。列宁指出辩证唯物论要求于自然科学家的，只有一件事：就是科学家应该明白他是在研究客观世界，而客观世界是独立于意志之外的物质的存在。关于这个世界的陈腐法则和概念底崩溃，决不表示我们对这个世界的知识底崩溃。正相反，它证明了人类知识底力量。
    列宁底“唯物论与经验批判论”，是与现代科学最新成就有关的自然科学理论里所发生的一切新而又新的问题的钥匙。现代科学，在关于物质底构造及其法则底知识上，已经有了更大的进步。原子能的知识和实际应用，宇宙线底研究，化学和生物学上的新发现，都证实了列宁对自然科学发展方向底光辉预见。所有这些复杂多端的现象，只有从“唯物论和经验批判论”中所发展了的哲学的立场出发，才能给与正确的估价。此书早已变成了那些从事研究自然的苏维埃科学家们的手册。辩证唯物论对科学的有利影响，在米邱林和李森科底生物学说中是很明显的。
    （四）
    “唯物论和经验批判论”，是战斗的布尔什维克党性在哲学方面的一个典范。
    此书底全部内容，列宁都极明确地提示了哲学中两个基本派别的斗争——唯物论和唯心论。他痛斥了一切想“超脱”唯物论和唯心论底“片面性”，而宣称什么“哲学的新派别”，把这“新派别”美其名曰实证论，现实论等。列宁把这种哲学上的诡计，叫作“教授派头的欺骗”。
    列宁以真正布尔什维克的热情，驳斥了一切“卑鄙的”中间路线的哲学派别，这些派别在每一个问题上，都企图使唯物论和唯心论的倾向混淆起来，列宁异常深切地指出，想撇开哲学上基本的两个派别的企图，是如何有害，如何的无价值和无结果。
    列宁这部伟大著作的每一页，都流露出布尔什维克的原则性和反对资产阶级思想的不可调和的斗争，无论这种思想，在形式上是如何掩盖和粉饰。
    斯大林同志，在其对辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义问题底天材的研究中，把列宁底伟大思想，向前推进了一步。斯大林同志曾写道，辩证唯物论是布尔什维克党底世界观。这一论述，是列宁对于哲学的党性思想的直接继承和发展，它卓越地表明了我们底哲学的科学及党性的意义。
    “唯物论与经验批判论”，不仅对正确地理解世界，给人们提供了锁钥，而且也使人了解世界底革命的转变。它把对唯心论，形而上学和蒙昧主义的无限敌意，注入读者的心里。今天，这个著作自初次问世以来，已经四十年了，它的伟大思想，照耀得比以前更灿烂了。
    “唯物论与经验批判论”是那些不能被“禁止”或“排斥”的科学著作之一。马列主义底革命哲学，具有一种不可抗拒的号召力。任何发现有革命思想的地方，任何一种科学思想，力求渗入社会和自然法则底本质里去时，如果没有马克思主义的哲学，都不可能有进展，因为马克思主义是和现代科学要求符合的，是唯一彻底的科学的哲学。
    随着年代的过去，列宁这部经典的哲学著作，愈来愈渗入到各国中了。而这是不难理解的。在帝国主义国家里，特别是在变成了现代反动和蒙昧主义中心的美国和英国，许多进步分子，都依据现代科学的世界观。在科学和为进步的世界观而斗争的一致性，必然地导向辩证唯物论和马列主义底哲学上来。列宁这本书，是掌握最进步的、最科学的现代世界观的宝贵源泉，是与形形色色现代反动哲学思想作坚决斗争的源泉。
    因此，“唯物论与经验批判论”，是各国共产党在他所反对帝国主义，反对各种资本主义奴役的斗争中的一个有力武器。
    在人民民主国家里，反对资产阶级世界观的斗争，一天天更激烈了。因为这个世界观，在知识分子的头脑中，仍然很牢固，同时在一部分自然科学、历史学、政治经济学的著作中，在大学的讲坛或说教中，还时常表现出这个资产阶级的世界观来。
    社会主义建设进一步的成功，将愈来愈赖于知识分子与先进的工农干部摆脱资产阶级世界观的程度如何与坚决性如何而定。
    必须记住：正如联共（布）党底经验所指示，思想上的和哲学上的斗争，是争取实现社会主义的阶级斗争形式之一。
    这就是为什么在人民民主国家里，现在应该认真地从事于思想意识上的哲学“研究”，象列宁在当时所说的一样。
    列宁底天材著作“唯物论与经验批判论”，对马克思主义党在其伟大而艰苦的事业中，将是无法评价的。
