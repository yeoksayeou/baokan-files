　　Worker-Peasant Mutual Aid
  　Clothing Factory Donates to Disaster Victims
    [This City News] Workers at the Beiping Clothing Factory's Branches Two and Four are enthusiastically launching a donation drive to aid disaster victims. All twenty-four members of the Communist Youth League in Branch Four have donated. Veteran worker Xu Yincheng donated the money he would have spent on cigarettes. In just a few days, they donated 758.5 jin of millet. The Communist Party branch, Communist Youth League branch, and trade union of Branch Two donated over 1,000 jin of millet yesterday (the 20th) afternoon. Workers expressed, "When we were in difficulty, the peasants helped us; when the peasants are in difficulty, we workers should also help them. Workers and peasants are one family!"
    [This City News] The North China Military Region's Garrison Battalion is actively responding to the Military Region Headquarters and Political Department's call to save one liang of rice per person per day for disaster relief. They first convened an expanded meeting of the battalion committee on the 14th of this month to discuss how to respond to and implement this campaign. Subsequently, each company held branch cadre meetings, group meetings, and soldiers' meetings to mobilize, and each squad engaged in in-depth discussions. Some even said, "Saving one liang is too little, it's best to save more." Everyone also reviewed past wasteful practices. Attention is now being paid to "saving whenever possible" and "not wasting a single grain of rice or a bit of vegetable" during office work, meals, and dishwashing. Each company has now taken action.

  　被服厂捐助灾民
    【本市讯】北平被服厂二、四两分厂工人，热烈展开捐款救灾运动。四厂的二十四个青年团员，都捐了款。老工人徐银城把抽烟的钱都捐出来了。几天工夫，就捐了小米七百五十八斤半。二厂的中共支部，青年团支部和职工会，昨（二十）日一个下午就捐了一千多斤小米。工人纷纷表示：“我们有苦时，农民帮忙；农民有苦时，我们工人也该帮忙，工农是一家！”
    【本市讯】华北军区警备营，积极响应军区司令部、政治部号召每人每日节约一两米救灾运动。首于本月十四日召开营委扩大会，讨论如何响应和贯彻这一运动。接着各连都先后召开中共支部的支干会、小组会和军人大会，进行动员，各班都展开了深入讨论。有的还说：“节约一两太少，最好多节约点。”大家对过去浪费的现象也进行了检讨。办公、吃饭、洗碗都在注意“能省就省”和“不浪费一粒米、一点菜。”现各连均已行动起来。
