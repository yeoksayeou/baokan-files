Remembering Comrade Jin Fu's Martyrdom
    Geng Xi

    On December 17th of last year, a large prison van drove to the main street of Nanjing's Xinjiekou, stopping because it was blocked by vehicles in front. The prisoners in the van all wore white cloth hoods, and to prevent them from speaking, they were also wearing mouth covers. Passersby curiously stared at them. Suddenly, one of the prisoners stood up, tore off his mouth cover, and shouted loudly to the people around:
    "Fellow villagers, I am a Communist!..."
    The guards who jumped out of the van raised their batons and threatened, "Don't speak!"
    However, this prisoner turned from one side to the other and shouted: "The Kuomintang launched a civil war...squeezing the people dry, forcing you to starve, they don't want the people to live!...The Kuomintang verbally shouts for peace (at that time, the reactionaries were plotting a fake peace), but they are still actively conscripting soldiers and seizing grain...."
    The crowd surrounded the prisoner.
    "Smack!" The guard broke the prisoner's head with a baton, and blood flowed onto his face, but he still shouted:
    "Fellow villagers, wait! The People's Liberation Army will come to liberate everyone soon..."
    The people ignored the police's obstruction and surrounded him, looking at the prisoner with sympathetic eyes.
    This "prisoner" was Comrade Jin Fu, the former Chief of Staff of the 8th Column of the First Army Group of the North China Field Army. On December 4th of last year, he accompanied Wang Yiyu, a major liaison staff officer sent by Huang Qiaosong, the Kuomintang 30th Army Commander, and intelligence agent Wang Yujia to the 30th Army to accept Huang's uprising. Before leaving, he also took his guard, Comrade Xu You. However, as soon as they arrived at the 30th Army, because Huang's plan was imprudent, he was betrayed by Dai Bingnan, a special service regiment commander under him. Jin Fu and the other three were stuffed into sacks by the special agents and transported by car to the Taiyuan Pseudo-Pacification Headquarters. After an interrogation, they were wrapped in sacks again, loaded into a car, and driven to the airport. At that time, the outposts were heavily guarded, and the guards were fiercely holding bayonets. Jin Fu looked at Wang Yiyu and nodded, saying:
    "It's good for us to die here for the people."
    However, the Yan bandits did not dare to shoot them. The Yan bandits treated them as peculiar bargaining chips and sent them on a plane. On the plane, they saw that Commander Huang also had handcuffs on his hands. They understood everything. In silent confrontation, they were transported from Taiyuan to Beiping, and then from Beiping to Nanjing.
    On December 17th, the second interrogation was conducted. Jin Fu, with blood flowing from his head, was escorted through the crowd. Entering the Kuomintang Special Criminal Court, the bandits wanted to force him to admit that he was Comrade Hu Yaobang, the director of the Political Department of the Army Group. Jin Fu's left arm was twisted off, but he always claimed to be the Minister of Propaganda of the 8th Column. When he left the hall, he could no longer move, but he still loudly said to Comrade Xu You: "No matter what torture the enemy uses, we must be firm!" Xu You was given electric shocks twice and sat on the iron tiger bench, passing out several times, but still did not reveal anything.
    In the last interrogation, Gu Zhutong and Dai Bingnan were both present. The judge asked Comrade Jin Fu:
    "Why did you become a spy?"
    "I am not a spy, I came to accept the uprising of the 30th Army in a dignified manner."
    The judge knew that there was no way to deal with such a people's fighter, so he had to point to the paper on the table in despair and say:
    "Then...sign here!"
    "If you want to say that Communists should be killed, I am a Communist, and I will not sign any other words."
    The judge then asked Commander Huang:
    "Why did you betray?"
    "I did not betray, I just don't want to fight a civil war."
    "It's fine if you alone don't want to fight, but why do you want everyone not to fight?"
    "Ask my soldiers, which one wants to fight?"
    The judge glared and said, "You sign too!"
    "If you dare to say that those who don't want to fight a civil war should be killed, I will sign, and I will not sign any other words."
    The judge and the "generals" under Gu Zhutong were all stunned.
    Commander Huang said indignantly: "The Minister of Propaganda was invited by me, and my staff was ordered by me to go, if you want to kill, kill me, they are innocent; why kill them?!"
    Comrade Jin Fu shouted sternly: "Commander Huang, you are also innocent, it is they who should be killed. Death cannot scare us. Someone will avenge us. Nanjing will be liberated, and the day of reckoning for them is coming!"
    At dusk on the 27th, Huang, Jin, and Wang were taken to Yuhuatai by the bandits and shot dead... Before his death, Commander Huang shouted in the identity of a Kuomintang member:
    "Long live the liberation of Nanjing! Long live the liberation of all China! Long live Mao Zedong!"
    Now, Nanjing and Taiyuan have long been liberated, and Comrade Xu You has been released from his life sentence in prison. When Taiyuan was liberated, the criminal Dai Bingnan was dragged out from his concubine's wardrobe, and under the angry demands of the people, he was finally sentenced to death by the military control commission's special court on July 8th, using his dog's life to repay the blood debts he had accumulated.

　　记晋夫同志的就义
    耿西
    去年十二月十七日，一辆大囚车开到南京新街口的大马路上，被前面的车辆所阻塞而停下来。车上的囚犯们头上都戴着白布套子，大概为了防止他们说话，嘴上也给戴了口罩。行人们都好奇的望着他们。突然，一个囚犯站起来，撕破了口罩，向周围的人们高喊：
    “老乡们，我是共产党！…………”
    跳下车来的押车人，举起棍子威胁着喊道：“不准说话！”
    但是，这囚犯从这边又转到那边去喊了：“国民党发动打内战，……搜括老百姓，逼得你们饿肚子，他们不要老百姓活命呵！……—国民党口头上喊着要和平（当时反动派正在要假和平的阴谋），可是他们还在积极的抓兵抢粮。………”
    人群把囚犯包围了起来。
    “拍！”押车人一棍子打破了这个囚犯的头，血流到脸上，但他仍旧高喊：
    “老乡们，你们等着吧！解放军不久就会来解放大家的。……”
    人们不顾警察的拦阻，围上来，用同情的眼睛直望着囚犯。
    这个“囚犯”就是原华北野战军第一兵团八纵队的参谋处长晋夫同志，他是去年十二月四号，在太原前线为接受国民党三十军军长黄樵松起义，随黄派来的少校连络参谋王一宇、谍报员王玉甲到三十军去的。临行前，还带了他的警卫员许有同志。但是一到三十军，因黄谋事不慎，被他手下的一个特务旅长戴炳南出卖了。晋夫同志等四个人被特务装在麻包里，用汽车送到了太原伪绥靖公署，经一度审讯，又把他们裹在麻包里，装上汽车开到飞机场。当时，岗哨密布，卫兵们都凶狠的端着刺刀，晋夫同志看着王一宇点了点头说：
    “我们为人民死在这里也好。”
    但，阎匪没有敢枪毙他们，阎匪把他们当作奇特功勋的交换品，送上了飞机。在飞机上，他们看见了黄军长手上也带了铐。他们明白了一切。在无言的相对中，他们被从太原运到北平，又从北平运到了南京。
    十二月十七号进行第二次审讯。晋夫同志头上流着血，从人群中被押了过去。进了国民党的特刑厅，匪徒们想逼着他承认是兵团政治部的主任胡耀邦同志。晋夫同志的左臂被绞得掉脱下来，但他始终宣称是八纵队的宣传部长。到下堂时，他身子已经不能动了，仍大声的向许有同志说：“敌人再用啥刑，都要坚决！”许有同志被上了两次电签，坐了铁老虎凳，昏过去了几次，仍旧没有问出什么来。
    最后一次审讯，顾祝同、戴炳南都到了场。法官问晋夫同志：
    “你为什么要当间谍呢？”
    “我不是间谍，我是堂堂正正来接收三十军起义的。”
    法官自知对这样的人民战士是没有办法的，只得绝望的指着桌子上的纸说：
    “那………你在这上面签字吧！”
    “你们要说共产党员该杀，我是共产党员，别的字不签。”
    法官又问黄军长：
    “你为什么叛变呢？”
    “我不是叛变，我是不愿打内战。”
    “你一个人不愿打也就算了，为什么还要大家都不打呢？”
    “你问问我的士兵那个愿意打？”
    法官眼一瞪说：“你也签字吧！”
    “你们敢说不愿意打内战的该杀，我就签，别的字不签。”
    法官以及顾祝同以下的“将军”们都楞住了。
    黄军长愤慨的说：“宣传部长是我请来的，我的参谋是我命令叫他去的，要杀杀我，他们无罪；为什么杀他们？！”
    晋夫同志厉声高叫：“黄军长你也无罪，该杀的正是他们自己。死，吓不倒我们。有人会替我们报仇的。南京一定要解放，清算他们的日子就要来了！”
    二十七号黄昏，黄、晋、王都被匪徒们带到雨花台枪杀了………黄军长临死前以国民党员的身份高呼：
    “南京解放万岁！全中国解放万岁！毛泽东万岁！”
    现在，南京、太原早解放了，许有同志已经从无期徒刑的监狱里出来了。当解放太原时，罪犯戴炳南从他小老婆的衣柜里被拉出来，在人民的愤怒要求下，终于在七月八日经军管会特别法庭判决死刑，以他的狗命偿还了他积欠的血债。
