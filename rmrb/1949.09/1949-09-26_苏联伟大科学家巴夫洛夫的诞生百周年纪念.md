　　Centenary of the Birth of the Great Soviet Scientist Pavlov
　　Yan Xichun
　　Today is the centenary of the birth of the late world-renowned physiologist, Soviet scientist Ivan Petrovich Pavlov. The Soviet Union, a country that deeply respects science, is holding grand commemorative events throughout the country this year to honor this master of science.

　　To help the general reader understand who Pavlov was, I will provide a simple introduction to his life and theories.

　　Pavlov, a Russian, was born on September 26, 1849, and died on February 27, 1936. He was one of the world's most famous physiologists. Today, his name is not only cherished by all the people of the Soviet Union but has also become a symbol of patriotism and dedication among Soviet scientists. Pavlov's contributions are a significant factor in the remarkable position Soviet science has achieved in the global scientific community.

　　Pavlov was an extremely amiable and dedicated scientist who was completely absorbed in his work. The famous Soviet artist Mikhail Nesterov, who painted two portraits of Pavlov, described him as "such a lovely person that I felt as if I had known him forever from the moment we met." From this, we can imagine Pavlov's character. Although he lived to the ripe old age of eighty-seven and became a scientific master of his time, he always maintained the spirit of his youth, often displaying enthusiasm, purity, and innocence.

　　At the same time, Pavlov was also a person who loved his country deeply. His patriotic fervor was even reflected in his academic pursuits. When he felt that his country seemed to lag behind others in science, the research enthusiasm of this amiable scientist, who was unafraid to forge ahead, was truly awe-inspiring. He often told his students, "You should work as fiercely as lions when striving for scientific status and success." He seemed to always remember that his scientific achievements were the success of the ideology of his motherland, the Soviet Union. Such a patriotic scientist is indeed rare.

　　Pavlov's great contributions to academia are a universally recognized fact. His greatness lies in his unique contributions to various fields of physiology. Almost every one of his experiments was revolutionary. Pavlov's last thirty-five years of academic life were focused on the study of brain activity (behavior) and conditioned reflexes. Today, conditioned reflexes have gradually developed into a scientific research method. When we talk about Pavlov's scientific legacy, we mainly refer to issues related to brain activity.

　　The term "conditioned reflex" is known to those who study psychology and physiology. He performed surgery on dogs, diverting their salivary glands to the outside, so that the dog's saliva would flow out, and the presence or amount of saliva flow could be used to observe the dog's salivation response to certain stimuli. For example, when a dog sees food, it immediately salivates. If a bell is rung before each time the dog is fed, and then food is given, after repeating this many times, the dog will salivate just by hearing the sound of the bell, even without seeing the food. Pavlov called this phenomenon a "conditioned reflex."

　　Although the theory of conditioned reflexes is still a subject of continued development and discussion in psychology and physiology today, in the Soviet Union, after research and promotion by scientists, at least the insights from this theory have made it possible to gradually find a material explanation and research path for all issues related to the brain and psychology. That is, various issues that were previously considered purely mental can now be studied using experimental methods.

　　Anyone who prides themselves on their knowledge of the natural world cannot help but be puzzled by the extremely complex phenomena when they come into contact with issues related to mental activity. Even Pavlov once said that the human brain is the most complex thing in the world. Many scientists regard issues of brain activity as the ultimate, impenetrable fortress of knowledge. However, Pavlov's exquisite experiments broke through this "fortress." He published several important laws about mental activity based on biology.

　　Pavlov's ideals sparked historical research into the origins and development of lower mental activities. In fact, Pavlov only raised this issue; actual research was carried out by scholars after his death. In the Soviet Union, many laboratories are currently conducting this work. They are studying the earliest mental activities of animals during the embryonic period. Their research method is to explore a phenomenon that Pavlov called "congenital activity" from the bodies of pregnant animals to determine what this activity of the embryo is, and to determine how much of the innate mental activity and the mental activity learned from experience account for during this period. The results of this research will undoubtedly provide a biological basis for various laws regarding higher mental activities.

　　Taking fetuses that are still quite far from their birth date from the uterus of pregnant animals obviously cannot exhibit environmental adaptation phenomena, because they cannot breathe or move. However, even a small stimulus, such as using the tip of a bristle brush (or a needle) to stimulate the limbs of the fetus, can allow an experienced observer to see the subtle movements of the fetus. Microscopic examination shows that at this time, individual mature cells already exist in the brain, and there are very fine communication connections between cells. This is very important because it is the earliest manifestation of mental activity in the brain organ. The results of studying infants who are only a few days old show that the brain organ is already very complex at this time. Some animals, including humans, have the ability to adapt long before normal delivery.

　　The development process of higher mental activity is not limited to the short time in the mother's womb because the existence of animals has already gone through a long history. The short pregnancy period is just a miniaturization of the long-term evolution of life. In fact, each animal has its own environmental adaptation, and therefore has various mental activities, from lower to higher. From this point of view, it is very important scientific work to study and compare the various levels of mental activity of various animals. Pavlov's famous experiments on his chimpanzees are concrete experiments of this kind of work, and also prove that such comparative research can be done. However, what Pavlov did was just independent experiments. Today, Soviet scientists are extending the experiments of this kind of mental activity to many animals, such as monkeys, birds, insects, etc., in many laboratories and comparing them.

　　In the Soviet Union, another development of Pavlov's scientific legacy is the study of the complex physiological reactions of his main theory, conditioned reflexes. Abstractly speaking, they are studying how the subtle connections between different parts of the brain are produced when higher mental activity occurs. This research is aimed at giving Pavlov's various theories about the brain a profound material content, and at finding out what connections there are between mental activity and substantive brain cells. This goal is not easy to achieve because it must be obtained through various methods.

　　One study is carried out in this way. Several silver electrodes are kept in contact with various parts of the dog's brain for a long time, while the dog is subjected to conditioned reflex experiments. When a reflex occurs in the dog's brain, a very small current can be seen to be generated on the electrode by modern precision instruments. The size of the current generated varies depending on the location where the electrode contacts the dog's brain. From this, it can be known that the different parts of the dog's brain have different effects on the action of conditioned reflexes. When Pavlov was alive, he originally planned to carry out this experiment in order to map out the effects of the brain membrane after the brain was stimulated, but unfortunately he died before he could fulfill his ambition. Today, Soviet scientists have completed it.

　　In addition to the above, Pavlov's contribution to medicine is also very great. This is also what he obtained from his physiological research. He has a hypothesis called "prolonged sleep." He believes that when a person is sleeping, brain cells are in a state of rest, and its function is to protect each cell from damage. He calls this state "protective inhibition." In the Soviet Union's patriotic war against Hitler, Soviet physiologists applied Pavlov's principle to explain traumatic shock, incurable pains, and various rheumatic diseases.

　　Pavlov's scientific legacy is now being studied and promoted by Soviet scientists. They are not satisfied with the success they have achieved. Many of Pavlov's thoughts in his later years are being excavated by those scientists today to make them more concrete. However, all of these are more or less based on Pavlov's theory of conditioned reflexes. Therefore, Pavlov's contribution to science is truly great.

　　Both Pavlov's academic achievements, his love for his motherland, and his loyalty to socialist society are worthy of learning by natural science workers in our country. (Attached picture) Pavlov's portrait

　　苏联伟大科学家巴夫洛夫的诞生百周年纪念
    严希纯
    今天是已故世界大生理学家苏联巴夫洛夫（ＩｖａｎＰｅｔｒｏｖｉｃｈ　Ｐａｖｌｏｖ）诞生百年纪念日。苏联是最尊崇科学的国家，苏联科学院今年特别在苏联各地举行了盛大的纪念会，来纪念这位科学大师。
    为了使一般的读者知道巴夫洛夫是什么样的人，特将他的生平和他的学说，作一通俗的介绍。
    巴夫洛夫，俄国人，生于一八四九年九月二十六日，死于一九三六年二月二十七日。是世界最著名的生理学家。他底名字，今天不仅是全苏联人民所爱戴的，而且已成为苏联科学界爱国主义和服务热情的象征。苏联科学在全世界科学领域取得特出的地位，巴氏的功绩是重要的因素之一。
    巴夫洛夫是一个十分和蔼而专心致志于他所好的工作的科学家。曾经为巴氏画过两幅像的苏联著名艺术家奈斯特洛夫（Ｍｉｈａｉｌ　Ｎｅｓｔｅｒｏｖ）对于巴氏有这样的描述，他说：“他是一个非常可爱的人，以致我和他几乎一见如故”。从这一段话，我们可以想见巴氏的为人。他虽然享寿到八十七岁的高龄而且成为当时的科学大师，可是他总能经常保持青年时代的气氛，常常是热情、纯洁和天真的。
    但是，巴氏同时又是一个热爱自己国家的人，他的爱国热情，甚至表现在他的治学精神上。当他觉得他的国家在科学上似乎要比别的国家落后的时候，这位和蔼可亲的科学家那种不顾一切勇往直前的研究热情，简直令人敬畏的。他尝和他的学生们说：“你们在争取科学的地位和成功时，应当象狮子一样的勇猛工作”。他似乎永远记得，他在科学上的成就，就是他的祖国苏联的思想的成功。象巴氏这种爱国的科学家，实在是不易多见的。
    巴夫洛夫在学术上的伟大贡献，已是举世公认的事实。他的伟大，在于他对生理学各部门的独特的贡献，差不多他的每一个实验都是带有革命性的。巴氏晚期三十五年的治学生活，都集中在脑的活动（行为）和条件反射（Ｃｏｎｄｉｔｉｏｎｄｄ　Ｒｅｆｌｅｘ）的研究。条件反射在今天已逐渐发展成为一种科学研究的方法。当我们说及巴夫洛夫的科学遗产时，主要的都是指有关脑的活动诸问题。
    条件反射这个名词，是研究心理学和生理学的人都知道的。他把狗施以手术，将狗的唾腺引到外面，使狗的涎水流出，由流涎的有无或多少，便可以看出狗对于某种刺激的流涎反应。譬如狗看见食物时，立刻就要流涎。如果在每次喂狗时，先摇一下铃，然后给以食物，如此施行多次之后，狗只要闻着铃声，就是不见食物，口中也会流涎。巴夫洛夫叫这种现象为条件（或制约）反射（Ｃｏｎｄｉｔｉｏｎｅｄ　Ｒｅｆｌｅｘ）。
    关于条件反射的学说，今天虽然还是心理学和生理学上继续发展和讨论的问题，但它在苏联，经过科学家们的研究与发扬，至少已经可以从这个学说的启示，使脑与心理学方面的一切问题，逐渐得到一个物质的说明与研究的途径。即是，以往认为只是精神上的各项问题，今天都可以用实验的方法来从事研究了。
    任何以富于自然界知识自负的人，当他接触到精神活动这一方面的问题时，没有不为那些极端复杂的现象所困惑的，就是巴夫洛夫也曾说过人类的脑是世界上构造最复杂的东西。许多科学家都把脑的活动诸问题，看为是知识上最后的、无法攻破的堡垒。然而巴夫洛夫的精湛的实验，却把这个“堡垒”打破了。他从生物学的基础，发表了若干关于精神活动的重要定律。
    巴夫洛夫的理想，引起了关于低级精神活动的来源和发展这两者的历史的研究。事实上，巴氏不过只提出了这个问题，至于实际的研究，反是巴氏死后学者们的事。在苏联，今天已有许多实验室在进行这一项工作。他们研究动物在胚胎时期最早的精神活动的究竟。他们的研究方法是从怀妊的动物体内探察一种巴夫洛夫称之为先天活动（Ｃｏｎｇｅｎｔａｌ　Ａｃｔｉｕｉｔｙ）的现象来确定胚胎的这种活动是什么，并决定在这期间天赋的精神活动和后来由经验所习得的精神活动各为多少。这种研究的结果，无疑的可以使关于高级精神活动的各种定律，获得生物学上的基础。
    从怀妊动物子宫中取出距出生日期还相当长的胎儿，显然是不能表现环境适应现象的，因为它还不能呼吸亦不能运动。但是即使用毛刷刚毛的尖端（或者针尖）去刺激胎儿的肢部这样一种小刺激，也能使一个有经验的观察者看出胎儿的细微运动。若用显微镜视察，可以看出，在这个时候，脑部已有个别成熟的细胞的存在，而且细胞与细胞之间亦已有了很精细的交通联系。这是很重要的，因为这是脑器官最早的精神活动的表现。从研究出生仅几天的幼儿的结果，知道脑器官在这时已经很复杂。若干动物，包括人类，在正常分娩相当久以前，就已具有适应的能力。
    高级精神活动的发展历程，并不只限于在母体子宫内的短时间内，因为动物的存在，已经过了长期的历史。短短的怀妊期，不过是长期生活演进的缩小而已。事实上，每种动物各有它的环境的适应，也就有各种各样的精神活动，由低级到高级。由此看来，研究各种动物的各级精神活动而加以比较，乃是很重要的一种科学工作。巴夫洛夫对于他的黑猩猩所作的有名实验，就是这种工作的具体实验，同时也证明了，象这样的比较研究是可以做的。不过，巴氏所作的还只是独立的实验，今天的苏联科学家，则正在许多实验室里，把这种精神活动的实验，推广及于许多动物，例如猴、鸟、昆虫……等，而加以比较。
    在苏联，另外一个巴夫洛夫的科学遗产的发展，就是研究他的主要学说条件反射在生理上的复杂反应。抽象地说，他们在研究，当高级精神活动发生时，脑子各部分之间的精微联系如何产生。这种研究，在于使巴夫洛夫对于脑的各种学理，获得深厚的物质内容，在于找出精神活动和实质的脑细胞之间，有何联系。这种目的，很不易达到，因为这是要由各种方法才可获得的。
    有一个研究是这样执行的。令若干银质电极和狗的脑子的各部分相接触很长的时间，同时对狗作条件反射的试验。当狗脑发生反射时，由近代精密的器械可以看出电极上有很小的电流产生。电极接触狗脑的部位不同，发生电流的大小也就不一。由是可知，条件反射在狗脑的作用上，各部分不相同。巴氏生存时，本来打算作这种实验以便把脑受刺激后脑膜所发生的影响作出图解来，可惜他赍志以没，今天苏联科学家才把它完成。
    除了上述种种外，巴夫洛夫对于医学上的贡献，也是很大。这亦是他从生理学的研究所得到的。他有一种假设，叫做延长的睡眠（Ｐｒｏｌｏｎｇｅｄ　ｓｌｅｅｐ），他认为人在睡眠时，脑细胞是在一种休息的状态，其作用在保持每一个细胞不受损害。他叫这种状态为保护的阻遏状态（Ｐｒｏｔｅｅｔｉｕｅ　Ｊｎｈｉｉｂｔｉｏｎ）。在苏联反抗希特勒的爱国战争中，苏联的生理学者，应用巴氏这个原理，去解释外伤震动症（ｔｒａｕｍａｔｉｃ　ｓｈｏｃｋ）、不治痛症（ｉｎｃｕｒａｂｌｂ　ｐａｉｎｓ）及各种风湿症等。
    巴夫洛夫的科学遗产，现在正被苏联的科学家们研究发扬中。他们并不以已得的成功为满足。许多巴氏晚年的思想，今天都在被那些科学家发掘着，使之成为更具体的形式。不过，所有这些，都多少是以巴氏的条件反射说为根柢。所以巴氏对科学的功劳，真是伟大之至。
    无论是巴氏学术上的造诣，或是他对于祖国的热爱，以及对于社会主义社会的忠诚，都是值得我国自然科学工作者学习的。（附图片）    巴夫洛夫像
