In Memory of Comrade Xiao Yu
　　Zhang Shushi
　　Comrade Xiao Yu was a revolutionary mother and an outstanding Communist Party member. She was from Yangzhou, Jiangsu. She joined the Party in 1939 and died of illness in Pingshan last September at the age of fifty-seven.

　　Comrade Xiao Yu was originally a traditional housewife. Her revolutionary thinking came from her son. Around 1929, she gradually became more progressive by often reading progressive books and magazines such as "The Pioneer" and "Yu Si" introduced to her by her son. When Japan invaded North China and Shanghai, she led her family of eight or nine to Chengdu and joined the Communist Party with her eldest son, Yang Daosheng. She took out her private savings and founded a wartime publishing house in Chengdu to promote the Party. When the Kuomintang reactionary tide rose, and the Sichuan Party was in a difficult environment of White Terror, she rented a house to shelter many of our comrades and helped them overcome many difficulties. At that time, many important meetings of the Sichuan Party were held in her home, and she personally served as a lookout. Because the Party was in economic difficulty, she invested capital to set up a small factory with other comrades, which Daosheng Comrade built himself by hand, earning money to subsidize the Party. Some comrades often ate and lived in her home when they were in difficulty, and all received enthusiastic hospitality.

　　In 1941, the Sichuan Party suffered sabotage by special agents. Daosheng Comrade was arrested and killed, and Xiao Yu Comrade was also monitored by special agents. The whole family had no choice but to move to Yan'an. Not long after arriving in Yan'an, she suffered a cerebral hemorrhage. Although she was rescued, her limbs remained immobile for two or three years. Every time I visited her, she would try her best to support her sick body and repeatedly asked me how the revolutionary situation was developing and when Chiang Kai-shek could be overthrown. When Hu Zongnan's bandit army occupied Yan'an, she moved from Yan'an to North China and lived in the countryside of Pingshan; she died on September 3rd last year due to a recurrence of her old illness.

　　Comrade Xiao Yu had a very strong Party spirit. When revolutionary work encountered difficulties, her will to fight became more determined. After her eldest son was arrested by special agents, the special agents asked her: "Is Yang so-and-so your son?" She firmly refused to recognize her own son. When she learned of Daosheng Comrade's sacrifice, she said to her other sons and grandchildren: "It is glorious to sacrifice for the revolution. You should work harder to study and continue to fight for the revolution." Now, as they wished, her second and third sons have become young cadres, and her grandsons and granddaughters are working and studying hard, and the revolutionary war has also achieved a nationwide victory. May she rest in peace!

　　悼萧禹同志
    张曙时
    萧禹同志是一位革命的母亲和一位优秀的共产党员。她是江苏扬州人，一九三九年入党，去年九月病故于平山，时年五十七岁。
    萧禹同志原是旧式的家庭妇女，她的革命思想是从她的儿子得来的。在一九二九年前后，她因常常阅读她的儿子介绍给她的“拓荒者”“语丝”等进步书报杂志，思想渐趋进步。在日本侵略华北和上海时，她即率领着全家八九口人到了成都，并和她的长子杨道生一起参加了共产党。她拿出私蓄，在成都创办战时出版社，为党宣传。当国民党反共逆流起来以后，四川党在白色恐怖的困难环境下，她租了房子掩护我们许多同志，帮助克服了他们的许多困难。那时四川党许多重要会议都在她家召开，她亲自担任放哨。因为党的经济困难，她便出资本与其他同志合办一个小工厂，由道生同志自己动手做工修建，赚了钱来补助党。有些同志困难时，常食宿在她的家中，皆承热情的招待。
    一九四一年，四川党遭受了特务破坏，道生同志被捕遇难，萧禹同志也被特务监视，不得已全家转移到延安。在延安不久，即患脑溢血病，虽获救治，但她的四肢在二三年中一直运动不便。我每次去看她的病时，她总勉力支持病体，反复问我革命形势的发展怎样，和几时才能打倒蒋介石。胡宗南匪军占领延安，她由延安转移到华北来，居平山乡间；因旧病复发在去年九月三日逝世。
    萧禹同志，党性很坚强，在革命工作遇到困难的时候，她的斗争意志愈坚决。她的长子被特务逮捕后，特务问她：“杨某是否你的儿子？”她坚不肯认她的亲子。她知道道生同志牺牲的消息时，向她的旁的儿子和孙子们说：“为革命而牺牲是光荣的，你们应当加倍努力学习，继续为革命奋斗。”现在，如她们所望的，他的二子三子都已成了青年干部，孙男孙女也正在努力工作与学习，而革命战争亦已获得全国性的胜利。愿她在地下安息！
