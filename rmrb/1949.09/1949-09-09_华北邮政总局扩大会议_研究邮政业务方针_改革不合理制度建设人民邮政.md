　　North China Postal Administration Enlarged Meeting
  　Studies Postal Service Policy
    Reforms Unreasonable Systems, and Builds People's Postal Service
    [Reported by this newspaper] The enlarged meeting of the heads of various postal zone administrations, convened for the first time by the North China Postal Administration, opened yesterday (8th). Attendees included the postal bureau chiefs, accounting section chiefs, and union directors from ten regions, including Beiping. Zhu Xuefan, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and Zhang Wen'ang, Deputy Minister of the Communications Department of the North China People's Government, attended and delivered speeches. Cheng Anyu, Deputy Director of the North China Postal Administration, gave an opening speech stating that in order to adapt to the development of the revolutionary situation, North China Postal Service has been newly divided into four postal zones: Beiping, Tianjin, Shanxi, and Pingyuan. This meeting must determine the issues of handover, organization, and personnel in the zoning process. It must also summarize the past work of North China Postal Service, determine future business policies, and appropriately resolve issues such as rural postal service, postal service unions, and unified systems. Zhu Xuefan, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, pointed out in his speech that the main service object of the postal service in the future should be the restoration and development of production, and to connect urban and rural areas, and domestic and international relations. To develop the business, it is necessary to rely on the working class, implement democratic management, and enhance the responsibility of employees. Although we are currently facing economic difficulties, as long as we adhere to the spirit of streamlining and thrift, these difficulties can be overcome. Comrades in the postal service in the old liberated areas displayed unparalleled creativity and developed a tradition of hard work and plain living in the difficult situation of the past, paving the way for the construction of the people's postal service. The postal service in the newly liberated areas has accumulated decades of experience, and its technical aspects should be absorbed. Deputy Minister Zhang Wen'ang said: China's postal system has been influenced by foreign imperialism, and many aspects are hindering the construction of the people's postal service. Taking the personnel system as an example, for instance in work, half is in English, half is in Chinese. In the future, apart from the necessary use of English, there is no need to do so. In the past, only seniority of employees was valued, the longer the service, the more stable the position, resulting in employees' passive attitude of "not seeking merit, but seeking no fault," which made it difficult to unleash their creativity. Talented people could not develop due to seniority restrictions. This has led to the phenomenon of the gradual degradation of postal work in the past: bloated institutions, low work efficiency, and increased expenses. We must reform this phenomenon. Deputy Minister Zhang finally called for saving expenses, unity between new and old comrades, learning from the construction experience of the Soviet Union, overcoming difficulties, and striving to develop the people's postal service.

　　华北邮政总局扩大会议
  　研究邮政业务方针
    改革不合理制度建设人民邮政
    【本报讯】华北邮政总局首次召集的各邮区管理局长扩大会议昨（八）日开幕。到有北平等十地区的邮政局长、会计科长及工会主任等。中华全国总工会朱学范副主席、华北人民政府交通部张文昂副部长均出席讲话。华北邮政总局成安玉副局长致开会词称：为了适应革命形势的发展，华北邮政已新划成北平、天津、山西和平原四个邮区。这次会议必须确定划区中移交、机构和人事等问题。并总结过去华北邮政工作，确定今后业务方针，以及适当的解决乡村邮政、邮政工会及统一制度等问题。中华全国总工会朱学范副主席讲话时指出：邮政业务今后应以恢复与发展生产为其主要服务的对象，沟通城乡及内外关系。为要发展业务，就得依靠工人阶级，实行民主管理，提高职工的责任感。目前我们虽然遇到经济上的困难，只要我们本着精简节约的精神，困难定能克服。老解放区邮政工作同志在过去的困难形势下，曾发挥了无比的创造力，养成艰苦朴素的传统作风，给人民邮政的建设工作开辟了光明的前途。新解放区的邮政曾积累了数十年的经验，其技术方面应该加以吸收。张文昂副部长说：中国邮政制度曾受了外国帝国主义的影响，有很多地方是妨碍着人民邮政的建设，以人事制度来说：例如在工作上，一半用英文，一半用中文，今后除了必要的还用英文外，就不必要这样作。过去只重视员工的资历，年代越久，地位就越稳固，造成了员工“不求有功、但求无过”的消极工作态度，因此很难发挥其创造力，有能力的人也因资历的限制不能发展。这样就造成了过去邮政工作日益退化的现象：机构庞大，工作效率低落，开支反而增多。这种现象我们必须进行改革。张副部长最后号召节省开支，新老同志团结一致，学习苏联的建设经验，克服困难，为发展人民的邮政而努力。
