　　A Visit with Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Representatives
  　Representative of Religious Circles: Wu Yaozong
    Shang Kai
    Mr. Wu Yaozong's first words upon meeting the reporter were: "The Chinese people have liberated us, and religion should also undergo a major renovation." Mr. Wu is a Christian believer, fifty-five years old this year, with already greying hair. This time, he participated in the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference as the chief representative of religious circles.

    "I have had a good impression of the liberated areas for a long time." Mr. Wu, with extremely excited and joyful feelings, described his journey to the liberated area and his observations: He left Hong Kong for Beijing in February of this year, passing through North Korea, just two months after the Soviet army's withdrawal. In a film, he saw the Soviet army helping to liberate Korea, and the Korean people loving the Soviet army and seeing them off as they returned home, realizing the great internationalist spirit of the Soviet and Korean military and civilians. Crossing the Yalu River and entering the Northeast, in Andong, in Shenyang, he saw workers in various factories and mines actively producing, enthusiastically and unrestrainedly, and he began to see the great power of the working class after liberation. In Beijing, he met with the leaders of the Chinese Communist Party and shook hands with Chairman Mao for the first time. Mr. Wu said: "This was the happiest moment for me." Later, he joined the Chinese Peace Delegation and attended the World Peace Congress, passing through Moscow to Prague. At the mass rally in Tiananmen Square in Beijing, he said: "I saw a review of the world's people's forces, and I saw the guarantee of world peace." He also said: "These scenes are really too moving."

    Talking about participating in this Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, he said: "This is an unprecedented great unity of the Chinese people's forces. A new China begins from this, and the people truly become the masters of the country." He then continued: "In our religious aspect, we have been bound and utilized by imperialism and feudal forces in the past. In today's Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the freedom of religious belief is clearly stipulated, which is exciting."

    Mr. Wu also believes that the internal of Christianity must eliminate the corrupt and decadent toxins, and get rid of the influence of European and American capitalism in thought. He called on all believers to strengthen the study of New Democracy, Chairman Mao's speeches, and the documents of the Political Consultative Conference, to carry out self-education, in order to strive to participate in the great cause of building a new China.

    Finally, Mr. Wu expressed his views on maintaining world peace. He said: "Today's world is a struggle between revolutionary forces and counter-revolutionary forces. We must stand on the side of the revolution and overthrow the reactionary forces in order to win peace. Neutrality is impossible, as it will invisibly help the reactionary forces and endanger peace." Regarding the American White Paper, Mr. Wu directly exposed it, saying: "This is a new conspiracy by American imperialism, unwilling to fail." But he also firmly believes: This Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the great unity of democratic forces, will surely smash any aggressive conspiracy of American imperialism.

　　中国人民政协代表访问记
  　宗教界代表吴耀宗
    商恺
    吴耀宗先生和记者见面时的第一句话便是：“中国人民解放了我们，宗教也应当大大的革新了。”吴先生是一位基督教信徒，今年五十五岁，已须发斑白。这次他以宗教界首席代表的资格，参加了中国人民政治协商会议。
    “很久以前我对解放区就有一个良好的印象。”吴先生以极兴奋愉快的心情，叙述来解放区的经过和观感：他是于今年二月离开香港到北京的，路经北朝鲜，当时正是苏军撤退后两个月；在一部影片上，看到了苏军帮助朝鲜解放，朝鲜人民热爱苏军，欢送苏军返国的镜头，体会到苏鲜军民伟大的国际主义精神。渡过鸭绿江，进入东北的国境，在安东，在沈阳，各厂矿工人，积极生产，热情奔放，他开始看到解放后工人阶级的伟大力量。在北京会见了中共诸领袖，第一次和毛主席握手。吴先生说：“这是我最快活的时候。”以后，他参加了中国和平代表团，出席世界和平大会，经过莫斯科到布拉格。在北京的天安门广场群众欢迎会上他说：“我看到了世界人民力量的检阅，看到了世界和平的保障。”他又说：“这一些场面，真是太感动人了。”
    谈到参加这次中国人民政治协商会议，他说：“这是中国人民力量空前的大团结，新中国从此开始，人民真正做了国家的主人。”他又接着说：“在我们宗教方面，过去曾受着帝国主义、封建势力的束缚和利用。在今天中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领上，明确规定了宗教信仰的自由，这是令人兴奋的。”
    吴先生并认为基督教内部必须清除腐恶陈败的毒素，从思想中摆脱欧美资本主义的影响。号召全体教徒加强学习新民主主义，毛主席言论，政协会文献，进行自我教育，以努力参加新中国的建设伟业。
    最后，吴先生发表他对维护世界和平的意见。他说：“今天的世界，是革命力量和反革命力量的斗争，我们必须站在革命的方面，打倒反动力量，才能争取和平，中立是不可能的，那无形中会帮助了反动力量，危害了和平。”对美国白皮书，吴先生直接了当的予以揭露，他说：“这是美帝国主义不甘失败，而又布置的新阴谋。”可是他也坚信：这次中国人民政治协商会议，民主力量的大团结，一定能粉碎美帝国主义的任何侵略阴谋的。
