Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 20th:
Eletelgraph Agency Prague dispatch: London dispatch, British Communist Member of Parliament Piratin, in a conversation with an Eletelgraph Agency reporter on the 19th, described the devaluation of the pound as an act of betrayal against the British working people. This action came from the hands of right-wing trade union leaders, who just last week received the support of the British Trades Union Congress for Cripps' policies. The Bevin-Cripps group is resorting to the old trick of saying "this is an election year, workers should unite" in order to get the Trades Union Congress to accept the government's policies before announcing the devaluation of the pound.

Piratin said: "Although the left-wing labor movement anticipated such an action, many were shocked when this rebellious action actually happened. The ten-point statement issued in Washington last week made them believe that such a drastic auction would probably not happen at this time. The impact of devaluation in Britain will be a further increase in the cost of living for British workers. It will increase the price of raw materials, making British products more expensive and therefore even more difficult to sell, even in the dollar market."

When asked about his opinion on the motives for devaluation, Piratin told the Eletelgraph Agency reporter that this action was taken to realize the long-awaited desire of American and British capitalists to lower the living standards of British workers. Piratin recalled that in 1931 they achieved this goal by actually cutting wages. But they can no longer play the same old trick. This action was planned long ago and is being implemented gradually. For example, the Bevin government announced in April that the government would not increase subsidies for increased import costs, and that the government would continue to support the policy of freezing wages. These two measures undermined the British Labor government's pretended independent stance, such as importing meat from Argentina, which caused meat prices in Britain to rise rapidly. Cripps does not need to announce further cuts in imports; imported goods will now be automatically reduced due to high prices.

Piratin said: The devaluation of the pound may cause its reputation to deteriorate rapidly, which would mean that the government will collapse in the next few months. The United States would be happy to see the Labor government fall and the Conservative government come to power, but among British workers, the Conservative Party is loathed. The Labor government can no longer hope to gain the support of the disillusioned working class at home to solve its difficulties. Piratin believes that devaluation will inevitably lead to the downfall of the Labor government.

### 英共国会议员皮拉丁　严斥英镑贬值  这是对英工人生活水平的进攻　英货亦将因成本增高更难销售

　　英共国会议员皮拉丁
  　严斥英镑贬值
    这是对英工人生活水平的进攻
  　英货亦将因成本增高更难销售
    【新华社北平二十日电】电通社布拉格讯：伦敦消息，英国共产党国会议员皮拉丁，十九日在与电通社记者的谈话中，把英镑贬值描述为对英国劳动人民的叛逆行为。这一行动出自右翼的职工大会领袖之手，他们于上星期刚刚得到英国职工大会对克利浦斯政策的支持。贝文——克利浦斯集团要玩弄以前的老诡计，说什么“今年是选举年，工人应团结一致”，为的是在宣布英镑贬值之前，驱使职工大会接受了政府的政策。
    皮拉丁说：“左翼劳工运动虽预料将会有这样一种行动，但当这种叛逆的行动实际发生时，许多人都为之一惊。上星期华盛顿发表的十点声明，使得他们相信了这样厉害的拍卖在这个时候大概不会发生。贬值在英国的影响，将为英国工人生活费用的再度提高。它将增加原料的价格，而使英国产品更为昂贵，并因此而使它甚至在美元市场也更为难于销售。”
    在被问以他对贬值的动机的意见时，皮拉丁告电通社记者说：采取这种行动，是为了实现美英资本家们所等待已久的愿望——降低英国工人的生活水准。皮拉丁拉着说：在一九三一年他们以实际的削减工资来达成这个目的。但他们现在已不能再要弄同样的老戏法了。这次的行动是早就策划好了，而是逐步付诸实行。例如，贝文政府于四月间宣布，政府不增加对增加了的入口费用的津贴，以及政府继续支持冻结工资的政策。这两项措施，破坏了英国工党政府所装出来的独立姿态，例如自阿根廷输入肉类，这使得英国的肉类价格迅即上涨。克利浦斯不须再宣布进一步的削减入口，入口货物现将由于高昂的价格而自动削减了。
    皮拉丁说：英镑的贬值可能使其声誉迅速恶化，这会意味着政府将于下数个月内垮台。美国将会高兴看到工党政府下台和保守党政府上台，但在英国工人当中，保守党是臭气熏天的。工党政府不能再希望得到国内幻想已破灭的工人阶级的支持，以解决其困难。皮拉丁相信，贬值将不可避免地引起工党政府的垮台。
