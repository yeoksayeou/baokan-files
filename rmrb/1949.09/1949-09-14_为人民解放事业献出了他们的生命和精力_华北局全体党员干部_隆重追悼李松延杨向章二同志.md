　　Dedicated Their Lives and Energy to the Cause of People's Liberation
　　All Party Members and Cadres of the North China Bureau
　　Solemnly Mourn Comrades Li Songyan and Yang Xiangzhang
　　[Our Newspaper's Report] At 3:30 PM on August 28th, all Party members and cadres of the North China Bureau held a meeting to mourn Comrades Li Songyan and Yang Xiangzhang, who died from overwork due to long-term revolutionary work. Comrade Li Songyan served as the Chief of the Data Section of the Research Office of the North China Bureau, passing away at the age of 31. Comrade Yang Xiangzhang served as the Deputy Section Chief in the Social Affairs Department of the North China Bureau, passing away at the age of 32. Both comrades joined the Chinese Communist Party in 1938, experienced the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan and the three-year People's Liberation War, persevered through the most difficult years, and worked tirelessly, dedicating their entire lives and energy to the great cause of People's Liberation. After the main officiant, Ping Jiesan, Secretary-General of the North China Bureau, spoke at the meeting, Li Zheren, Director of the Research Office of the North China Bureau, reported on Comrade Li Songyan's resume, and pointed out three merits that are worthy of learning for all comrades: "First, the spirit of faithfully working for the Party's cause. No matter how complex and trivial the work, he could accomplish it happily. Even when ill, he worked until late at night to complete the tasks assigned to him by the Party. Second, he was good at uniting and helping comrades, such as helping comrades who newly joined the revolutionary work to understand the various construction works and various policies of the liberated areas, and helping them to learn revolutionary theories and the skills to serve the people. Third, in response to the Party's call for frugality, he still requested to be discharged from the hospital when he was critically ill, unwilling to spend more public funds and increase the burden on the people." Subsequently, Liu Yuying, the wife of Comrade Li Songyan, gave a reply.
