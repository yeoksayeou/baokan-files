    [This Municipality News] In order to facilitate small remittances between the people of North China and Northeast China, the North China Postal General Bureau has reached an agreement with the Northeast China Postal and Telecommunications General Bureau to handle remittances between the two regions. The measures will be announced and implemented shortly. Collection and payment will be in local currency (People's Currency in North China and Circulation Vouchers in Northeast China), with the exchange rate based on the publicly set exchange rate between the two banks (People's Bank and Northeast Bank) in Shanhaiguan on that day. Each postal general bureau will send several people to form a remittance transfer office there, responsible for this business.
