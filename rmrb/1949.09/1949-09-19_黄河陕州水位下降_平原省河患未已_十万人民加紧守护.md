　　【Xinhua News Agency, Xinxiang, 17th】After the water level at Shanzhou maintained a flow rate of 10,000 cubic meters per second for 98 hours, it has begun to recede. By 12:00 on the 17th, the water level had dropped to 295.8 meters, and the flow rate had decreased to 7,700 cubic meters per second. The duration and total flow of this flood are unprecedented in recent decades. Regarding the duration of the flow at Shanzhou, the longest durations were 45 hours in 1932 and 1933, and 29 hours in 1942. The total flow was 2.7 billion cubic meters in 1933 and 1.8 billion cubic meters in 1942. This time, the total flow is more than 3 billion cubic meters. Although the water level in the upper reaches of the Yellow River has begun to drop, the river in Pingyuan Province is shallow, and the situation is still critical. Currently, tens of thousands of cadres and people have been mobilized and are closely guarding the dikes.
　　
　　【Urgent Telegram from Xinxiang, 17th】The water level of the Yellow River in Pingyuan Province is constantly rising. The water level at Shou Zhang is almost level with the embankment, and an emergency was declared along the entire line on the night of the 15th. The Zaobaolou levee in Shou Zhang and the civilian embankment at Daluzhuang in Liangshan County (now called Kunshan), collapsed on the morning of the 16th due to erosion by the floodwaters, despite unsuccessful rescue efforts. After the water from Daluzhuang flowed out of the embankment, it converged with the lake water (note that the Jinshan section of the Dongping Lake levee breached on the 15th) and flowed into the Xiaoqing River together. This caused the Xiaoqing River in Liangshan to breach southward, threatening the Yellow River dikes above Shilipu from both sides.
    
　　In this emergency situation, responsible cadres at all levels of the local Party and government personally led engineering teams to actively carry out repairs. Liu Yichun, Secretary of the Pingyuan Provincial Party Committee, Han Zheyi, Deputy Chairman of the Provincial Government, and Yuan Ling, Deputy Director of the River Affairs Bureau, went to Batou, Puyang on the morning of the 15th to supervise and direct the efforts. In order to prevent the disaster area from expanding, the Pingyuan Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Government decided to: firmly defend the Jin Dike on the north bank; resolutely defend the dangerous sections of the Yellow River dikes above Shilipu on the south bank, and build a small dike east of Liangshan to prevent the disaster area from expanding.

　　【Another Telegram】After the high water level (12,500 flow rate) reached Shanzhou on the 14th, Pingyuan Province has been in extreme crisis along the entire line since the night of the 15th. Dozens of leaks occurred overnight. Embankments in Puyang, Puyang County, Yuncheng, Fan County, Liangshan, and other counties were eroded to varying degrees. The water level in Shou and Fan counties was only 8 cm or 5 cm away from the top of the dike, and in the most severe cases, it had already passed the top of the dike (these places are currently guarded by subsidiary embankments), creating an extremely critical situation. The civilian embankments above Qihe County also completely collapsed due to the excessive water force. Below Taochengpu, due to the confluence of the Yellow and Wen rivers, the floodwaters were surging, and most of the embankments and stone structures were submerged in the water (note: Historically, the Yellow River would backflow into Dongping Lake through the Wen River during flood periods, but this time, the water from the Wen River and Dongping Lake is flowing into the Yellow River, a rare phenomenon in history). The dangerous sections above Taochengpu and below Guantai also experienced submergence phenomena. Thanks to our strict organization, all flood prevention personnel were on the dikes, the reserve teams were concentrated in advance, and the masses in the villages along the dikes were able to provide timely protection, so the leaks were all blocked. Currently, all employees along the Yellow River and the people along the coast are working hard to protect it.

　　黄河陕州水位下降
  　平原省河患未已
  　十万人民加紧守护
    【新乡十七日电】陕州水位在一万流量持续九十八小时后，已开始下落，至十七日十二时水位降至二九五点八公尺，流量降为七七○○秒立方公尺。此次涨水持续时间之久与总流量之大，为近数十年来所未有。按陕州流量持续时间，在一九三二年、一九三三年最久时间为四十五小时，一九四二年为二十九小时。持续的总流量，在一九三三年为二十七亿，一九四二年为十八亿，此次总流量则为三十余亿。目前黄河上游水位虽已开始降落，但平原省河浅，现仍在严重时期，目下干部及群众已有十数万人一致动员起来，仍在严密守护中。
    【新乡十七日急电】平原省境黄河水位不断上涨。寿张水位几与堤平，十五日夜全线告急。寿张枣包楼大堤与梁山县（现名昆山）大陆庄之民埝，于十六日早晨在洪水冲刷下，抢修无效，发生溃决。大陆庄水出堤后，与湖水汇集（按东平湖湖堤金山段，于十五日决口），一齐注入小青河，因而又使梁山之小青河向南溃决，使十里铺以上之黄堤，腹背感受威胁。
    在此紧急情况下，当地各级党政负责干部，亲率工程队积极抢修，平原省委刘宜春、省府副主席韩哲一、河务局副局长袁陵，于十五日上午亲赴濮阳坝头，督促指挥。为防止灾区扩大，平原省委及省府决定：北岸固守金堤；南岸坚守十里铺以上之临黄大堤险工，并在梁山以东修筑一道小埝，以防灾区扩大。
    【又电】陕州十四日高水位（一二五○○流速）到达后，平原省自十五日夜以来，全线危急万分，一夜发生漏洞数十处，濮阳、濮县、郓城、范县、梁山等县堤坝各被冲刷一部。寿、范两县水离堤沿只有八公寸或五公寸，最甚者已过堤顶（这些地方现正看守子埝），危机万分。齐河县以上之民埝，亦因水势过大全部溃决，陶城铺以下，因黄、汶二水交加，洪水汹涌，坝埽大部蛰陷入水（按：黄河历史上在洪水时期都是通过汶河倒注东平湖，唯此次却是汶水及东平湖水流注入黄河，为历史上罕有现象）。在陶城铺以上贯台以下各险工亦均发生蛰陷现象，由于我组织严密，防水员全部上堤，后备队事先集中，临堤村群众防护及时，因之漏洞均已堵住。现黄河全线员工及沿岸群众，正努力防护中。
