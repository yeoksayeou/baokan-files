Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, September 6th: This newspaper, the Xinhua Daily, published an editorial on the 4th, commenting on the Soviet government's note of August 29th to the Yugoslav Tito government. The editorial stated: After more than a year of objective developments, especially after the Soviet Union's continuous publication of notes exposing the Yugoslav government, the ugly true form of the Tito clique as a running dog of imperialism has been fully revealed. The Chinese people completely support the Soviet Union and the democratic countries' just condemnation of the Tito clique. The editorial said: Since the birth of the Soviet Union, we Chinese people have gained unwavering experience from countless historical facts: whenever Sino-Soviet relations are good, it is a time of victory for the Chinese people and the rise of the people's strength; conversely, whenever Sino-Soviet relations are undermined by imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries, it is a time of misfortune for the Chinese people. Historical facts have proven this time and again. Therefore, today we must strive to strengthen the great unity and cooperation between the Chinese and Soviet people, and we must further strengthen internationalist education. We must firmly believe that the interests of the Soviet Union are forever consistent with the interests of the Chinese people. Comrade Stalin said twenty-two years ago: "Anyone who unreservedly, unconditionally, openly and faithfully, without holding any secret military meetings, prepares to defend and protect the Soviet Union, is a revolutionary, because the Soviet Union is the world's first proletarian revolutionary country and is building socialism in the world. Anyone who unreservedly, unconditionally, and unhesitatingly prepares to defend and protect the Soviet Union is an internationalist, because the Soviet Union is the base of the world revolutionary movement. Without defending the Soviet Union, it is impossible to defend and promote this revolutionary movement." Today, when the world has been divided into two camps, not only must we resolutely stand with the Soviet Union, but only the strength of the peaceful democratic camp led by the powerful Soviet Union can protect the interests of the people of all countries in the world, and protect the interests of the Chinese people. Without international assistance, the complete liberation of the Chinese people is unimaginable.

### 新华日报社论号召  努力加强中苏团结和合作进一步加强国际主义教育

    新华日报社论号召
    努力加强中苏团结和合作进一步加强国际主义教育
    【新华社南京六日电】此间新华日报四日发表社论，评论苏联政府八月二十九日致南斯拉夫铁托政府的照会。社论说：经过一年多来的客观形势的发展，尤其是经过苏联连续发表的对南斯拉夫政府照会的揭发，铁托集团是帝国主义走狗的丑恶原形已经毕露，中国人民完全拥护苏联和各民主国家对铁托集团的正义的斥责。社论说：从苏联诞生以来，我们中国人民已经从无数历史事实中得到了确定不移的经验：凡是中苏关系好的时期，就是中国人民胜利，人民力量抬头的时期；反之，凡是中苏关系被帝国主义和国民党反动派破坏的时期，中国人民就是倒霉的时候。历史事实是如此屡验不爽，因此，我们今天必须努力加强中苏人民伟大的团结和合作，必须更进一步地加强国际主义的教育，要坚定地相信苏联的利益与中国人民的利益是永远一致的。斯大林同志在二十二年前，曾经说过：“凡是毫无保留地、无条件地、公开而忠实地、不举行什么秘密的军事会议，准备保卫和守护苏联的，这样的人就是革命家，因为苏联是全世界第一个无产阶级革命的国家，正在世界上建设社会主义。凡是毫无保留地、无条件地、毫不犹豫的准备保卫和守护苏联的，这样的人就是国际主义者，因为苏联是世界革命运动的根据地，如不保卫苏联，就不可能保卫、促进这种革命运动。”在今天世界已分裂为两个阵营的时候，不仅我们要坚决地和苏联站在一起，而且也唯有由强大的苏联所领导的和平民主阵营的力量，才能保护世界各国人民的利益，保护中国人民的利益。没有国际的援助，中国人民的彻底解放是不可想象的。
