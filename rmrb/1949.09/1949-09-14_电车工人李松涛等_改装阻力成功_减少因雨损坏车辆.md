　　Electric Tram Workers Li Songtao and Others
  　Successfully Modified Resistors
　  Reducing Vehicle Damage Due to Rain
    [This City News] Electrician Li Songtao and driver Ran Shixin of the Beijing Electric Tram Company, in order to reduce vehicle damage caused by rain, carefully studied and modified the resistors for twenty days, successfully enhancing insulation. This prevents trams from stopping due to resistor waterlogging connecting to the ground wire. This not only contributes greatly to production savings, but also opens the door for cooperation between track workers and repair factory workers. On August 24th, a heavy rain damaged thirty locomotives, and only twenty could be dispatched the next day. When the idle drivers were together, Ran Shixin suggested: "Cars break down every time it rains, we should study how to make trams impervious to rain!" Electrician Li Songtao had worked on spray water trams for five years, and he was very clear about the resistor's constant immersion in water. He said that the reason why the car couldn't run when the rain was slightly heavier was that, apart from accumulated rain being too deep and soaking the electric rollers, burning the roller core, some of the reasons were because the resistor's insulation equipment was not good, or the car seat was wet, and moisture flowed onto the "resistor." The resistor was connected to the ground wire, the circuit breaker tripped, and the car stopped. He proposed that, in order to enhance the resistor's insulation, bamboo tubes could be placed on the four pillars of the resistor, then glass tubes, and the car base and resistor separated with magnetic tubes, and the resistor pieces should be ground flat and cut properly. Ran Shixin reflected his opinions to the administration and the trade union, and immediately received approval and encouragement. Therefore, Ran and Li went to the repair factory every morning to study, and then went to work on the track in the afternoon. Their principle for modifying the resistors was to use the company's existing materials as much as possible, so as not to increase the company's expenses, only spending 1,200 yuan to buy bamboo poles. By the 11th of this month, the resistor modification was completed, and tested with 1,000 volts of high-voltage electricity without any problems. Yesterday (the 13th), with the assistance of the repair factory workers, the two installed the modified resistors on the car. At five o'clock, the car was tested, and there were no problems after heating. Water was poured on the resistors, and there was no effect. Twenty days of hard work had been rewarded, and the resistor modification was initially successful.
    The success of this experiment shows that the creativity of workers can only be brought into play under the leadership of the Communist Party. Before liberation, not only would the factory not trust the workers so much as to immediately approve the experiment, but the repair factory workers would not have provided assistance. At that time, the track workers and the repair factory workers were greatly alienated under the provocation and deception of the Japanese invaders and the Kuomintang reactionaries. When they met, they didn't even speak to each other. And this time, when installing the resistors, the repair factory workers saw that Ran and Li were working for a long time, and they all rushed to connect the wires, telling them to rest. Chairman Mao instructed: "Consult the masses when something happens." This has been powerfully demonstrated once again. The last heavy rain damaged thirty cars (from that time on, trams stopped running when it rained lightly), but the workers used their brains and basically solved the problem of resistors being damaged by rain.

　　电车工人李松涛等
  　改装阻力成功
　  减少因雨损坏车辆
    【本市讯】北平电车公司电工李松涛和司机冉世新，为了减少因雨损坏车辆，经二十天悉心研究，改装阻力，增强绝缘力试验成功，使电车不致因阻力着水连地线而停驶。这不只对生产节约有很大贡献，而且打开了车路工人与修造厂工人合作的大门。上月二十四日，一场大雨，坏了机车三十辆，第二天仅能出车二十辆。当没有事的司机们在一起时，冉世新提议：一下雨，就坏车，大家应研究一下，怎么样能使电车不怕雨？电工李松涛跟过五年喷水电车，水车的阻力时常被水泡着，他对这方面很清楚。他说雨稍大车就走不了的原因，除积雨过深，泡到电滚子里把滚子心烧坏外，有的是因为阻力绝缘设备不好，或是车座子湿了，水分流到“阻力”上，阻力与地线相连，就跳闸，车就不走了。他提出，为了增强阻力的绝缘力，可在阻力的四根立柱上，套上竹管，再套上玻璃管，把车底座和阻力用磁管隔开，再把阻力片磨平切好。冉世新把他的意见反映给行政和工会后，马上得到同意，而且受到鼓励。于是冉、李两人每天上午到修造厂去研究。下午再到车路上去上班。他们改装阻力的原则是尽量用公司所存的材料来作，免得增加公司的花费。仅仅用了一千二百元买竹竿。到本月十一日，阻力改装完了，用一千伏特的高压电试验，没出问题。昨天（十三日），在修造厂工人协助下，两个人把改装的阻力装到车上。五点钟，开车试验，经热没有问题了，又在阻力上泼上水，结果也毫无影响，二十天的辛勤得到了报酬，改装阻力获得了初步的成功。
    这个试验的成功，说明了只有在共产党的领导下，工人的创造力才得以发挥。解放前，不只厂方不会这样信赖工人，马上准予试验，就是修造厂的工人，也不会予以协助的。那时，车路工人和修造厂工人，在日寇和国民党反动派挑拨欺骗下，隔膜大得很，见了面，连话都不说。而这次，在按装阻力时，修造厂工人看见冉、李两个人作的时间长一点，都来抢着接线，叫他们休息。毛主席指示说：“有事就找群众商量。”又得到一次有力的说明。上次大雨坏车三十辆，（从那时起，电车遇小雨即收车），但是工人们动了动脑筋，就基本上解决了下雨坏阻力的问题。
