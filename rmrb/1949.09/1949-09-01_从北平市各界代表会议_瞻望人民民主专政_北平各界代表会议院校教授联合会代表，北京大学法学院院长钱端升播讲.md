Fellow countrymen,

　　Our Beiping Municipality convened a People's Representatives Conference half a month ago. Fellow countrymen probably all know that it was a grand and very successful meeting. Tonight I want to report to everyone: this meeting was not only a great success in itself, but its success guarantees that the Chinese people can smoothly establish a national system of people's democratic dictatorship.

　　Beiping has been liberated for more than half a year. In the past six months, the Beiping Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Beiping Municipal People's Government have convened many symposiums to discuss relevant issues with representatives from all walks of life. For example, regarding the rent issue, the Municipal Committee and the People's Government convened two political symposiums, extensively soliciting opinions on rent from people from all walks of life before the government promulgated the rent regulations. However, these symposiums lacked universal and comprehensive representation, so the government decided to convene a People's Representatives Conference.

　　Before the convening, the Beiping authorities consulted with the responsible persons or representatives of various parties and people's organizations in Beiping for many times. The purpose was to ensure that the allocation of representative quotas was appropriate and the organization of the meeting was reasonable. The authorities wholeheartedly adopted the good suggestions provided by all parties. They had no preconceived ideas. They were determined to make the representatives conference a success and enable the conference to truly represent the people of Beiping from all walks of life. I once participated in the consultation as a representative of the preparatory committee of the Beiping University Faculty and Staff Union. Therefore, the sincere and humble attitude adopted by the authorities in the consultation process was something I experienced myself, not something I heard.

　　The People's Representatives Conference had a total of 332 representatives. Among them:

　　Representatives by virtue of office: 15
　　Party representatives: 24
　　Organization representatives: 169
　　Representatives of military and government personnel: 25
　　Representatives of minority nationalities: 4
　　Other representatives from all walks of life: 95

　　Representatives by virtue of office were held by heads of the Military Control Commission and the People's Government. Party representatives were nominated by city-level organizations of six parties, with the Chinese Communist Party being only one of them. Organization representatives accounted for more than half of the total number and were elected by various people's organizations. Among them, the Beiping Municipal Trade Union had 70 representatives, suburban farmers had 30 representatives, and the remaining 69 representatives were allocated to the Beiping Municipal Youth Federation, Women's Federation, Student Federation, and faculty and staff unions of various schools. The representatives of military and government personnel only represented the personnel and not the military or government, and were also elected by the personnel themselves. There were four representatives of minority nationalities, representing the Hui, Mongolian, and Tibetan ethnic groups, who were selected and appointed by the government. During the meeting, I met Mr. Dorje Tseten, a Tibetan representative, who was a young man who had just come to Beiping from Tibet. Mr. Dorje Tseten's participation in the Beiping People's Representatives Conference symbolizes our new and good ethnic policy and guarantees the unity of all ethnic groups in China. Therefore, I want to specifically mention it. As for the other representatives from all walks of life, 45 were representatives of industry and commerce invited by the government, and 39 were patriotic democratic figures specially invited by the government. The method of producing representatives of industry and commerce is different from that of workers, peasants, youth, teachers, etc. This is because workers, peasants, etc. have formally established organizations. Therefore, they can elect representatives themselves, while industry and commerce have not yet formally established organizations, so they can only be selected by the government for the time being.

　　Please note that the allocation of representative quotas is very appropriate and fair. The people's democratic dictatorship requires the leadership of the working class, so workers' representatives should naturally be more numerous than any other sector. The foundation of the people's democratic dictatorship is mainly the alliance of workers and peasants, so the representatives of peasants should naturally be quite numerous. Beiping is a large city, and the industrial and commercial sectors bear important responsibilities for the prosperity of the urban economy, so the number of industrial and commercial representatives should be second only to workers. Beiping is also a cultural city, with many schools and a particularly large number of faculty, staff, and students, so the representatives of students and faculty and staff together numbered 38, ranking third. The allocation of quotas conforms to the political principles of New Democracy and reflects the individuality of Beiping Municipality. It is indeed extremely appropriate and fair.

　　Secondly, I want to report on the general situation of the People's Representatives Conference. The meeting lasted for six consecutive days. For five days, plenary sessions were held to listen to reports from government leaders, discuss these reports, and finally discuss the representatives' own proposals. For one of the six days, plenary sessions were not held, and representatives from all walks of life held group meetings separately to discuss various reports. Whether it was a plenary session or a group meeting, discussing reports or discussing proposals, the sincerity of the speakers' attitudes and the enthusiasm of their emotions were all worth noting. Our workers and peasants originally had a lower level of education, but they spoke very enthusiastically. Especially after Chairman Mao personally attended the conference and spoke, read letters from citizens to him, and raised the two issues of rising prices and heavy taxes for the representatives to discuss, the representatives all expressed their opinions in a rising atmosphere and a joyful mood in order to solve the problems.

　　The gains of the meeting were very rich. The 248 proposals covered all issues in Beiping Municipality, and the most important proposals focused on the following four issues. The first is to eliminate counter-revolutionaries and severely punish bandits and special agents; the second is to restore and develop production and turn the consumer city into a productive city; the third is to develop cultural and educational undertakings, and especially to increase schools or other learning facilities for the working class and peasants and their children; the fourth is to streamline and economize, and free up financial resources to vigorously support the front and strive for construction. In addition, representatives from all walks of life reaffirmed the need to establish the profound friendship between China and the Soviet Union among the masses of the people, so they immediately established a preparatory committee for the Beiping branch of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association at the conference. In just six days, the Beiping People's Representatives Conference was able to face up to the importance of the above-mentioned tasks, accept the government's report, put forward and pass appropriate proposals, and complete the important tasks of the People's Representatives Conference.

　　Fellow countrymen, the Beiping People's Representatives Conference was undoubtedly a great success, and it will undoubtedly be praised by fellow countrymen across the country. However, although the success of the meeting itself is extremely remarkable, the greatest contribution of the meeting is to guarantee the smooth establishment of the people's democratic dictatorship and give us the confidence to establish the people's democratic dictatorship.

　　How can I say this? Because first, the Beiping People's Representatives Conference achieved the people's democracy. In the current stage of China, the people are the working class, the peasant class, the petty bourgeoisie, and the national bourgeoisie. These four classes all participated in the People's Representatives Conference, and under the leadership of the working class (through the Communist Party), they united together. In the People's Representatives Conference, the workers' representatives, due to their enthusiastic, sincere, and powerful speeches, and the rich content of their proposals, did indeed play a leading role, making the other representatives admire, respect, trust, and strive to emulate them.

　　The state of the people's democratic dictatorship will give various freedoms to the people within the people. In the Beiping People's Representatives Conference, freedom of speech did reach a high degree of development. Anyone could speak, and anything could be said. "Know everything and say everything" was indeed achieved.

　　The power of the people was indeed demonstrated. Each representative from all walks of life regarded the Beiping Municipal People's Government as their own government. Therefore, each representative recognized that the task of building a new Beiping was their task and the task of the city's people. Everyone understood the importance of anti-espionage work, production work, cultural and educational work, and streamlining and economizing. Because of this correct understanding, a spirit of working together was shown in the discussion of reports and the discussion of proposals.

　　The democracy shown in the Beiping People's Representatives Conference cannot be compared with the so-called democracy in capitalist countries. Our New Democracy is freedom, harmony, unity, and all representatives regard the government as their own government and work together with the government to engage in construction. Their so-called democracy is unfreedom, conflict, division, a minority manipulating the government, and the majority of the people being oppressed by the government. Ours is democracy, true democracy, theirs is false democracy, anti-democracy.

　　Second, the Beiping People's Representatives Conference also achieved the people's dictatorship. The representatives from all walks of life expressed deep hatred and old grudges towards the running dogs of imperialism, namely the landlord class and the bureaucratic bourgeoisie, as well as the Kuomintang reactionaries and their accomplices who represented these classes, and were determined to suppress them and implement dictatorship. Especially for special agents and bandits, the representatives were angry and demanded strict exposure and severe punishment.

　　Of course, the Beiping People's Representatives Conference cannot be compared with the popularly elected People's Congress. In the future, when conditions are ripe, the People's Congress produced by popular election will be a more powerful institution, which will be more able to represent the people and reflect the people's opinions and demands. However, the People's Representatives Conference is a bridge to the People's Congress, so the two million citizens of Beiping must enthusiastically accept the resolutions of the conference after the closing of the representatives conference, encourage each other, and ensure the full implementation of the resolutions of the representatives conference.

　　Fellow countrymen, the democracy shown in the Beiping People's Representatives Conference is new democracy, true democracy, and the people's unreserved democracy for themselves. I myself have done some research on the political systems of various countries, and I have also witnessed and heard about the democracy in Western capitalist countries. I can honestly tell my fellow countrymen that compared with the parliaments of capitalist countries and the Beiping People's Representatives Conference that I personally participated in this time, ours is the only one worthy of being called democracy, while their parliaments are only run by the wealthy, the rich and moneyed people. Not only did I myself reach such a conclusion, but the representatives who had the same opportunity as me to participate in the Beiping People's Representatives Conference and also had the opportunity to observe the parliaments of capitalist countries also reached the same conclusion.

　　Fellow countrymen, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Beiping People's Representatives Conference was a success. The representatives conferences in other places are guaranteed to be successful, and the people's democratic dictatorship is also guaranteed to be successfully established in China. This is the confidence and conclusion I personally gained from the success of the Beiping People's Representatives Conference.

　　从北平市各界代表会议
  　瞻望人民民主专政
  　——北平各界代表会议院校教授联合会代表，北京大学法学院院长钱端升播讲同胞们：
    我们北平市在半个月以前召开了一个各界代表会议。同胞们大概都已知道了，它是一个极盛大的会议，也是极成功的会议。我今晚要报告大家：这个会议，不但它本身是大大的成功，而且它的成功保证了中国人民可以顺利地建立人民民主专政的国家制度。
    北平已经解放半年多了。半年来，中国共产党北平市委员会和北平市人民政府曾经召集过很多次的座谈会，和各界代表商谈有关的问题。譬如关于房租问题，市委会和人民政府曾召集过两次政治座谈会，广泛的征求各界人士对于房租的意见后，政府才颁布房租条例。但是这种座谈会欠缺普遍的、全面的代表性，所以政府便决定召集各界代表会议。
    在召集之前，北平当局曾和北平各党派，各人民团体的负责人或代表人，作过多次协商，其目的，一在使代表名额的分配得以恰当，二在使会议的组织得以合理。各方面提供的良好意见，当局无不倾心采纳。他们没有一点的成见。他们决心要把代表会议搞好，要使会议能真正的代表北平各界人民。我曾经以北平院校教职员联合会筹备委员会代表的资格，参加过协商。所以当局在协商过程中所采取的诚恳的、虚心的态度，是我自己体验到的，不是听来的。
    各界代表会议共有代表三百三十二人。其中：
    当然代表　十五名
    党派代表　二十四名
    团体代表　一百六十九名
    军队及机关工作人员代表　二十五名
    少数民族代表　四名
    其他各界代表　九十五名
    当然代表由军管会及人民政府首长担任。党派代表由六个党派的市级组织推派，中国共产党只是其中之一。团体代表名额占总名额半数以上，均由各人民团体选派。其中，北平市工会代表七十名，郊区农民代表三十名，其余六十九名则分配于北平市的青联、妇联、学联及各级学校的教职联等等。军队及机关工作人员的代表，只代表工作人员，而不代表军队或机关，也由工作人员自行选派。少数民族代表四名，代表了回民及蒙族藏族，由政府遴聘。我在会议中认识了藏族代表多杰才旦先生，他是一位方自西藏来平的青年。多杰才旦先生能够参加北平市各界代表会议，象征了我们新的、好的民族政策，也保证了全中国一切民族的团结。所以我特别要提出来一谈。至于其他各界代表，有四十五名是由政府聘请的工商界代表，三十九名是由政府特别邀请的爱国民主人士。工商界代表产生的方法和工农青教等代表不同，这是因为工农等已正式成立了团体。所以，可以自行推选代表，工商界尚未正式成立团体，所以暂时只能由政府遴选。
    要请大家注意，代表名额的分配是十分恰当的，公平的。人民民主专政需要工人阶级的领导，工人代表自然应比任何其它一界多些。人民民主专政的基础，主要的是工人和农民的联盟，农民的代表自然也应相当众多。北平是一个大都市，繁荣都市的经济，工商界负有重要责任，工商界代表的名数所以要居第二位。北平又是一个文化城，学校多，教职员及学生也特别多，所以学生及教职员的代表加起来有三十八人，居第三位。名额的分配符合了新民主主义的政治的原则，又反映了北平市的个性，实在是恰当极了，公平极了。
    其次要报告各界代表会议进行的概况。会议一共连续了六天。五天开大会，听取政府首长的报告，并讨论这些报告，最后则讨论代表自己的提案。六天之内，有一天不开大会，而由各界代表分别举行小组集会，讨论各种报告。无论是开大会或是开小组会议，讨论报告，或是讨论提案，发言者态度的诚恳，和情绪的热烈，都是值得标出。我们的工人农民本来文化水准较低，但是他们讲话十分踊跃。尤其在毛主席亲临大会讲话，宣读市民给他的信件，提出物价高涨、捐税繁重两个问题交代表讨论后，代表们个个都在高涨的空气中，欢愉的心情中，发表意见，以求解决问题。
    会议的收获，是十分丰富。二百四十八个提案包括北平市一切的问题，最重要的提案则集中在下列四个问题。第一是肃清反革命分子，严惩匪特；第二是恢复和发展生产，使消费的城市变为生产的城市；第三是发展文化教育事业，并特别为工农大众及工人子弟增设学校或它种学习便利；第四为精简节约，誊出财力来努力支援前线，努力建设。此外，各界代表复认定了中苏深厚友谊有在人民大众中普遍建立的必要，所以即在大会中成立了中苏友好协会北平分会筹备会。短短六天之内，北平市各界代表会议，能正视了以上各种工作的重要性，接受了政府的报告，提出并通过了适当的提案，完成了各界代表会议的重要任务。
    同胞们，北平市各界代表会议，无疑地是大大的成功，也无疑地会得到全国同胞们的称赞。但是，会议本身的成功虽极可观，而会议最大的贡献，是保证了人民民主专政的顺利建立，是给了我们建立人民民主专政的信心。
    怎样说呢？因为第一，北平市各界代表会议做到了人民的民主。在现阶段的中国，人民就是工人阶级，农民阶级，小资产阶级和民族资产阶级。这四个阶级都参加了各界代表会议，并且在工人阶级（通过共产党）领导之下，团结起来了。各界代表会议中，工人代表，由于他们发言的热烈、诚挚、有力，和他们主张的富有内容，的确起了领导的作用，使其他的代表钦佩、拜服、信赖，并力求看齐。
    人民民主专政的国家，对于人民内部，将给予各种自由之权。在北平各界代表会议中，言论自由的确达到了高度的发展，什么人都可以说话，什么话也都可以说。“知无不言”，“言无不尽”的确做到了。
    人民的力量也的确表现出来了。各界代表个个以北平人民政府为自己的政府。因而，个个代表都认识了建设新北平的任务，是他们和全市人民的任务。个个了解了肃反工作、生产工作、文教工作和精简节约的重要性。因为有了正确的认识，所以于讨论报告和讨论提案时，都显出了共同努力的精神。
    北平市各界代表会议中所表现的民主，比资本主义国家的所谓民主，是不可以比拟的。我们的新民主主义是自由、是和协、是团结、是全体代表都把政府看做自己的政府，和政府同心协力去从事建设。他们的所谓民主主义是不自由、是冲突、是分裂、是少数人操纵政府，多数人民受政府压迫。我们的是民主，是真民主，他们是假民主，是反民主。
    第二、北平市各界代表会议也做到了人民的专政。各界代表，对于帝国主义的走狗即地主阶级和官僚资产阶级以及代表这些阶级的国民党反动派及其帮凶们，表示了深仇和宿恨，决心要镇压他们，要实行独裁。尤其对于特务匪徒，代表们愤怒，代表们要求严行检举，严厉惩治。
    当然，北平市各界代表会议尚不能和普选的人民代表大会相比。今后条件成熟，由普选而产生的人民代表大会将为更有力量的机构，将更能代表人民，反映人民的意见和要求。但是各界代表会议是过渡到人民代表大会的一座桥梁，所以北平二百万市民在代表会议闭幕之后，要热烈的接受会议的决议，要互相勉励，要保证代表会议决议案的全部执行。
    同胞们，北平市各界代表会议所表现的民主是新的民主，是真正的民主，是人民对自己不折不扣的民主。我本人对于各国的政治制度有过一些研究，对于西方资本主义国家的民主主义也有过目击与耳闻。我可以老老实实地告诉同胞们，以资本主义国家的国会，和我自己这次所亲身参加的北平市各界代表会议相比，我们的才配得上称做民主，而他们的国会仅仅是财主，有财有钱的人做了主人。不但我本人得着这样的结论，同我一样有机会参加北平市各界会议，也有机会观察资本主义国家的国会的代表们，也得到同样的结论。
    同胞们，在中国共产党领导之下北平市各界代表会议是成功了。其他各地的代表会议，保证可以成功，人民民主专政也保证可以在中国顺利地建立起来。这是我个人因为北平市各界代表会议的成功而得到的信心和结论。
