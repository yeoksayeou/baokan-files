　　A Moving Song
    —Introducing Han Qixiang's "Wang Piqin Goes Down South Road"
    Jia Zhi
    "Wang Piqin Goes Down South Road" (from "North China Literature and Art," issue 6) is a storytelling piece, but also a narrative poem with a strong lyrical flavor. It is truly a poem of the people.
    The story sung in the poem is, in general terms: Wang Piqin, a farmer in Hengshan, found it difficult to make a living by renting land, so he also dug coal to get by, barely feeding his family of three: his wife, his son, and himself. After the Kuomintang "dog official Yama" He Shaonan was driven out by the people of Suide and fled to Hengshan, the people of Hengshan suffered even more. One of He's bandit henchmen, a security captain nicknamed "Donkey Judge," after gorging himself, wanted to eat some pickled vegetables from Hengshan, so he sent two thugs to the homes of the common people to loot pickled vegetables, "incidentally" "making a deal." The two thugs went to Wang Piqin's house while Wang Piqin was out digging coal. They asked Wang's wife for pickled cabbage, planning to rob them that night. When the thugs entered the house, their faces were painted black. They heated the tips of their guns red-hot and branded Wang Piqin's wife, slapped the crying boy, and swept away all the valuables (including Wang Piqin's wife's upper garment and bracelet) before slipping away. When Wang Piqin returned, he was "consumed with anxiety and anger," "crying out in despair." Ignoring his wife's advice, he wanted to go to the security team to report the crime. Astute readers can guess that his "lawsuit" would certainly not be accepted. Not only was it rejected, but the "Donkey Judge" captain instead falsely accused him of being a "Red bandit," saying that Wang Piqin had slandered them, damaging their reputation, and ordered the yamen runners to give Wang Piqin a thorough beating. Now that they had offended these evil people, the aftermath would be endless. Therefore, Wang Piqin and his wife hurriedly mortgaged their most precious plot of melon land to the landlord Chang Laocai, secretly took their son and a large tabby cat, leaving behind their reluctant "courtyard soil," and fled to the unclear but happy red land (referring to the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region). After entering the red land, it was a completely different world: everyone they met, whether it was the guards, the village chief, the masses, or the staff of the government offices, were all kind and helpful; everywhere they went, there was food and clothing, and they lived a good life. At first, Wang Piqin and his wife were still fearful, afraid of being deceived, but gradually they realized that the help they were receiving was genuine, without any intention of harming them. They confirmed that the new society led by the Communist Party was completely different from Hengshan (the old society ruled by the Kuomintang). The Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region had a policy of actively helping refugees. Under the leadership of the village chief and the voluntary help of the masses, Wang Piqin settled down and had a good year, harvesting seven dan of millet and mixed grains in the second autumn. He had turned his life around. Wang Piqin said he had "good luck." Obviously, without the Chinese Communist Party eliminating Chiang Kai-shek's criminal rule and establishing a new democratic society, Wang Piqin could not have had good luck; in Hengshan (that is, under the rule of the Kuomintang), he would only have perpetual bad luck. Haven't many people who lived under the Kuomintang rule seen this a lot? That winter, Wang Piqin hosted a banquet to thank everyone. The couple repeatedly reminisced about the benefits of Chairman Mao saving the people.
    The singing is moving. This is not because the story has any great legendary nature, but because: first, the theme is positive, with clear love and hatred; second, it richly portrays the life details of some characters in the story.
    The blind poet warmly praises and extols the new society, and fiercely denounces the dark rule of the Kuomintang. Because Wang Piqin is Han Qixiang's self-portrait of escaping from the white area (referring to the KMT-controlled area) to the red area, what he sings is what he personally experienced and heard, so he is extremely familiar with the new and old societies and the characters in the two societies. His portrayal is particularly profound, and his love and hatred are exceptionally clear. His praise and denunciation erupt from the depths of his heart. In the opening section of the poem, the blind poet first strongly expresses his attitude towards the new and old societies. Such as:
    Our Chinese population numbers in the thousands of thousands,
    The land is vast and cannot be exhausted,
    One is like heaven and the other is like earth,
    Under the same sky and on the same earth, the scenery is not the same!
    The people on one side enjoy happiness,
    The people on the other side suffer hardship,
    Here, the sky is blue and the sun is red,
    There, the sky is dark and people deceive each other!
    ……………
    In the story after the introduction, the blind poet contrasts the sharp struggle between the new and old worlds for people to see. How hateful are the faces of the captain and the thugs? What else could they say about the common people other than calling them "pests"! What other way out could Wang Piqin and his wife have but to escape to the red land after being bullied by thugs? Chang Laocai took advantage of Wang Piqin's misfortune to rob him again. The melon field worth a hundred yuan was only given thirty yuan, and he secretly wrote eighty yuan on the mortgage contract, taking advantage of Wang Piqin's illiteracy. How inhuman, and this is the nature of the landlords! As for after arriving in the red land, the People's Government and the new people treated them with complete love and help. How good was life here! Extortion, blackmail, terror, and deception... had all been swept away. People were living in a new relationship.
    The blind poet sings about Wang Piqin escaping from the KMT-controlled area to the liberated area, from the old society to the new society, seeking happiness. The positivity of the theme is commendable. The poem is about the events of 1939. At that time, the liberated area was still very small, with only twenty-three counties in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, and it was heavily surrounded by 400,000 Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops. The enemy wanted to strangle the bud of new China with military and economic blockades. But the more it was like this, the brighter the light emitted by the small but well-fed liberated area on the dark ground ruled by the Kuomintang. The life of the people in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region was on the rise and was once praised as "heaven." The newborn and the decayed, the bright and the dark, constituted a sharp contrast in fact. The blind poet's singing of this contrast is of great significance. It still has historical educational significance today.
    In this work, and in the blind poet's other works, the richness of the language is amazing. It is entirely "authentic" peasant language. In those dialogues and even narrations, you can hear and see the expressions, actions, wit, or honesty of every rural character. Truly, people speak human language, and ghosts speak ghostly language. This is an important reason why the blind poet is able to richly portray life and sculpt those characters. It proves that literature is indeed the art of language. And this familiarity with language is certainly inseparable from familiarity with society.
    In this work, and in the blind poet's other works, I believe that he is not only familiar with old storytelling, able to use Chinese-style artistic techniques (in fact, thought methods and expression methods), concisely and vividly summarizing things, but also inherits the excellent tradition of northern Shaanxi folk songs. Many lyrics are no different from northern Shaanxi folk songs.
    Therefore, Han Qixiang's works are relatively free in form, and the length of the poetic lines is not limited. In addition, from his singing, we understand that poetry is best sung; the people's epic is even better when it can be sung. This makes it easy for poetry to become the people's thing, to be universal among the people, and to become one of the effective propaganda tools that penetrate the people; the people can continuously receive education and encouragement from their own poet's long songs.
    The blind poet Han Qixiang's achievement in creation and performance should be said to be due to the CCP's education and transformation of old artists and the patient help of intellectual literary workers to Han Qixiang (from political study to the recording and modification of works), that he found the correct direction and gave play to his creative genius; otherwise, it would not have been possible for such excellent works as Wang Piqin Goes Down South Road to appear. There is no doubt about this. I am only talking about the blind poet's success in creation based on one of his works, as well as the enlightenment it gives us.

### 一篇动人的歌唱—介绍韩起祥的“王丕勤下南路”

　　一篇动人的歌唱
    —介绍韩起祥的“王丕勤下南路”
    贾芝
    “王丕勤下南路”（“华北文艺”第六期）是一篇说书，实在也是一篇有着浓厚的抒情色彩的叙事诗。这真是人民的诗歌。
    诗里所唱的故事，大体是：横山农民王丕勤，靠租地难以谋生，便同时掏炭度日，这才饥一顿饱一顿地养活了一家三口：婆姨、男孩、和他自己。国民党“狗官阎王”何绍南被绥德老百姓赶掉，逃到横山以后，横山的老百姓，就更遭了殃。何匪手下一个保安队长，外号叫做“驴判官”的，在吃得肠肥脑胀之余，还想吃一点横山的腌菜，便差了两名狗腿到老百姓家里捞腌菜，“顺便”“采个生意”。两名狗腿串到王丕勤家里，王丕勤掏炭不在家，问王的婆姨要了腌白菜，晚上就来行劫。狗腿们进门时脸上涂着黑，把枪探子烧红，烙上王丕勤婆姨一通，还把惊哭的男孩打了一巴掌，便将财物（连王丕勤婆姨身上的上衣和手镯在内）扫劫一空而溜。王丕勤回来，“连熬带急”，“气的干嚎”，不听婆姨的劝，要到保安队上去告。聪明的读者会猜到，他的“状”当然告不准。岂止告不准而已，“驴判官”队长反而诬赖罪在“赤匪”，说王丕勤诬告了他们，坏他们名誉，叫差役们把王丕勤饱打一顿。这下惹了坏种们，后患怕就无穷了，因此王丕勤夫妇急忙把最宝贵的一垧瓜地典给地主常老财，偷偷地带了男孩和一只大花猫，丢下难舍难离的“院土”，向了解不清的幸福的红地（指陕甘宁边区）逃去。进了红地以后，这是另外一个世界：遇到的人，无论是警卫队、村长、群众、机关人员，都是平平和和，热心帮助；处处有吃有穿，过的好光景。在先，王丕勤夫妇还怀着恐惧，怕上当，慢慢才明白了所得到的帮助是真实的，没有任何伤害人的意思在内。他们证实了共产党所领导的新社会与横山（国民党统治的旧社会）完全不同。陕甘宁边区对移难民是有积极帮助的政策的。在村长领导和群众自动帮助之下，王丕勤安下家来，过了一个好年，第二年秋里打了七石麻谷杂粮。这就翻了身。王丕勤说是交了“好运”。显然，没有中国共产党铲除蒋匪的罪恶统治，建立新民主主义社会，王丕勤是交不了好运的；在横山（即在国民党统治下），就只有永交恶运。这一点，在国民党统治下生活过来的人，不是看得很多了吗？这年冬天，王丕勤设酒席酬谢了众人。夫妻二人再三怀念着毛主席救人民的好处。
    歌唱是动人的。这不是因为故事有多大的传奇性，而在于：第一、主题积极，爱憎分明；第二、丰富地表现了故事中一些人物的生活情节。
    盲诗人，热烈地歌颂、赞美了新社会，疾恶如仇地痛骂了国民党底黑暗统治。因为王丕勤就是韩起祥由白地（指国统区）逃到红地的自我写照，他所唱的就是他所亲身经历、亲耳听到的，所以对新旧两个社会及两个社会里的人物极端熟悉，描画便特别深刻，爱憎也分外鲜明。他的歌颂和痛骂是从肺腑中爆发出来的。在开始一节引词里，盲诗人首先就强烈地表示了他对于新旧两个社会的态度。如：
    咱中国人口千千万，
    地土广大走不完，
    一个天来一个地，
    同天同地光景不一般
    ！
    一边的百姓享幸福，
    一边的百姓受磨难，
    这边是蓝蓝的天来太
    阳红，
    那边是天昏地暗人欺
    人！
    ……………
    在引词以后的故事里，盲诗人把新旧两个世界的尖锐斗争，对比地展开给人看。队长和狗腿们的嘴脸多么可憎，他们对于老百姓除了说是“害虫”以外，还能说是什么！王丕勤和他的婆姨被恶棍们欺负得除了逃往红地以外，还能有什么生路？常老财在王丕勤遇祸的当儿，又行了一下劫，值百元的瓜地只给王三十元，在典契上又暗写了八十元，欺负王丕勤不识字，多么残无人性，而这正是地主的本性！至于到红地以后，人民政府和新型的人民，对待他们，完全是亲爱与帮助，这里的生活，过得多么好！勒索、敲诈、恐怖、欺骗……已经扫除净尽。人们是生活在一种新的关系中。
    盲诗人歌唱王丕勤由国统区逃到解放区，由旧社会找到新社会，寻找幸福，主题底积极性，是值得称赞的。诗里写的是一九三九年的事情。那时解放区还很小，陕甘宁边区不过只有二十三县，且被四十万蒋胡匪军重重包围着。敌人想用军事和经济封锁把新中国的萌芽困死。但越是如此，小小的，但是丰衣足食的解放区，在被国民党统治的黑暗地面上所放出的光明，就格外强烈。陕甘宁边区人民的生活是上升的，曾被誉为“天堂”。新生的和腐朽的，光明的和黑暗的，在事实上构成鲜明的对照。盲诗人歌唱这种对照，有极大的意义。直到今天它还有历史的教育意义。
    在这篇作品里，和在盲诗人的其他作品里一样，语言底丰富，十分惊人。完全是“道地”的农民语言。在那些对话以至叙述里，你可以听见、看见每一个农村人物的表情、动作、机智或诚实。真是人说人话，鬼说鬼话。这是使盲诗人能够丰富地表现生活，雕塑出那些人物来的重要原因。证明文学确是语言的艺术。而这熟悉语言，当然与熟悉社会分不开。
    在这篇作品里，也和在盲诗人的其他作品里一样，我以为他不止是由于熟悉旧说书，能够使用中国气派的艺术手法（实即思想方法和表现方法），简要生动地概括事物，特别还继承了陕北民歌的优秀传统，许多唱词，实与陕北民歌无异。
    因此，韩起祥的作品，在形式上比较自由，诗句的长短不受限制，另外从他的歌唱里使我们了解到诗，最好是歌；人民的史诗，能唱尤好。这才使诗容易成为人民的东西，能普遍在人民中间，成为深入人民的有效宣传工具之一；人民能够从自己诗人的长篇歌唱里，不断地得到教育和鼓舞。
    盲诗人韩起祥在创作和表演上的成就，应该是说由于有中共对旧艺人的教育与改造和知识分子文艺工作者对韩起祥的耐心帮助（从政治学习到作品底记录和修改），他才找到了正确方向，发挥了他的创作天才；否则，便不可能有象王丕勤下南路那样优秀的作品出现，这是没有疑问的。我不过就盲诗人的一篇作品，说说他在创作上的成功，以及给我们的启示罢了。
