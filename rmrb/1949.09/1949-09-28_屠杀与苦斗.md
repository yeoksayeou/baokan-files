　　Massacre and Bitter Struggle

　　In large areas of Jiangxi Province, the red flag once flew for ten years. During that period, peasants turned over to become masters. But when the main force of the Red Army began the 25,000-li Long March, this area, once the brightest and most progressive in the country, fell into extreme darkness, terror, appalling massacre, and unparalleled bitter struggle.

　　Those years were written in blood, passed in the midst of blood.

　　After the Red Army's Long March, the local bully Luo Daonan in Zhukeng Township, Shicheng County, forced tenant farmers to work at his home, carrying burdens and plowing fields... They ate pig and horse feed. If a tenant farmer made a few pieces of fried tofu for the New Year, he would snatch them away. The local bully Zhang Shanmin in Tangtai Township sent Luo Ziru's (a handicraft worker) two sons off to be conscripted soldiers, beat Luo Ziru to death, and burned his house. His wife was beaten half to death and had to sell her third son to pay for medical treatment, but the injuries were never healed, and the whole family was ruined.

　　Nie Anbang of Wan'an County was the village branch secretary. After the troops withdrew, the enemy searched for him for months. He was finally captured one night and shot early the next morning. His home was completely destroyed, and his family was often beaten and scolded by the bullies. Finally, his seventy-three-year-old mother was forced to death by the enemy.

　　Zou Chongrun from Nanpidun Township, Third District of Taihe County, joined the Red Army and went north. His wife, Tian, was ill and unable to go with him. In April 1939, she was arrested by the Kuomintang Security Division and subjected to severe torture, forcing her to reveal the families of those who remained behind. Tian never said a word. On the third day, she was buried alive. Countless families of Red Army soldiers were killed, seized, or sold.

　　Chuantan and Liaotian in Wuning County became slaughterhouses for "people." At least eight or nine people were killed every day, and sometimes dozens. As for the methods of killing, they were varied. Beheading was considered the most common and the one that executioners were least happy to use. More often, they would cut open bellies, carve off pieces bit by bit, cut off ears, tongues, and noses, and dig out the heart and liver to fry and eat. Some even used awls to pierce thousands of holes in the body, causing people to slowly die. This applied to old men, children, men, and women without exception. These days lasted not for a few days or months, but for two full years, before the large-scale massacres were reduced to sporadic killings.

　　But no matter how cruel and vicious the massacres were, the people had already stood up. Having been masters, no matter how frantically the reactionaries persecuted them, they could not drag them back into "ignorance." The peasants silently gritted their teeth, watching their houses burn, their sons and brothers killed, their daughters dragged away, and their belongings looted. They silently watched all this, without uttering a word, but their teeth were clenched even tighter, and their fists were clenched even harder. All of this was expressing: "Wait! That day will come!" No matter how cruel the suppression, it could not extinguish the people's hearts!

　　Peasants near Yihuang City said: "The Red Army only stayed with us for a week, and when they saw we had no salt, they took out more than half a bowl of their own, dividing four taels among us. The Red Army didn't forget us even when they were eating salt. How could we forget them?"

　　Some peasants in Wan'an were forced to go up the mountains, each carrying two small knives. When the reactionaries came to arrest them, they would fight them to the death, which made the reactionaries somewhat restrained. In one village, a landlord forced the peasants to grow crops for him, but all the peasants in the village agreed not to plant. The landlord could not hire any workers and was left with no choice. It was in this long, dark night that the peasants persevered with hatred for the enemy and love for the Communist Party, until the day they saw their own troops again.

　　When our army liberated Jiangxi, many peasants in the old Soviet areas took out carefully preserved bundles of Soviet-era paper money and proudly showed them to the soldiers. When someone asked in surprise:

　　"You've kept these so well for so many years!"

　　They replied with a slightly displeased tone:

　　"Is there any question about that? Wouldn't Chairman Mao and our troops come back?"

　　屠杀与苦斗
    在江西省大块地区上，红旗曾飘扬了十年之久，在那个时期中，农民翻身当了主人，但当红军主力开始了二万五千里长征的时候，这曾是全国最光明最前进的区域，便陷入了极度黑暗、恐怖、惊人的屠杀同无比坚苦的苦斗中。
    那些年月是用血写成的，是在血中间过去的。
    石城县珠坑乡恶霸罗道南在红军长征后跑回本地，逼着佃农到他家干活，挑担耕田……吃的是猪食马食，佃户过年制几块油豆腐，他也要抢走。唐台乡恶霸张善民把罗自如（手工业工人）的两个儿子送了壮丁，打死罗自如，烧了他的房子，他的妻子被打得半死不活，只好把第三个儿子卖了养伤，伤也没治好，活活的断送了一家。
    万安县聂安邦是乡支部书记，当部队撤走后，敌人成月的搜索他，终于在一天晚上被捉住，第二天早就被枪杀了，家中完全被捣毁了，家人常常挨恶霸打骂，最后七十三岁的老母，活活被敌人逼死了。
    泰和县三区南皮墩乡邹崇润参加红军，随着北上，他的妻子田氏因为有病，不能随去，一九三九年四月被国民党保安师抓到严刑拷打，逼问有那些留下的人员家属，田氏始终不说一个字，到第三天被活埋了。红军家属被杀的，被强占或卖掉的不知有多少。
    武宁县船滩、辽田曾成了“人”的屠场，每天至少要杀八九个人，多的到几十个人。至于杀的方法，则是形形色色。砍头要算是最平常的，也是刽子手最不高兴用的了。更多的还是破肚子，一块块零割，割去耳舌鼻的，挖出人心肝炒吃的。更有用锥子在身上锥成千万个孔洞使人慢慢被锥死的，不问老头、小孩、男女无一例外。这种日子不是几天几月，而是一直过了两年，才由大批的屠杀改成了零星的杀戮。
    但不管屠杀是多么残酷、凶恶，人民已经站起来了，当过了主人，反动派任是再疯狂的迫害，也不能把他们再拉回到“愚昧”中去了。农民默默的咬紧牙关，看着自己的房子烧了，儿子兄弟被杀掉了，女儿被拉走了，东西被抢去了，他们沉默的看着这一切，没有吐出一个字，只是牙咬得更紧一些，拳头握的更坚一些，这一切却是在表示着：“等着吧！总有那样一天！”任是再残酷镇压，不能压熄了人的心！
    宜黄城附近农民说：“红军只在我们这里住一个星期，看到我们没有盐吃，把他们的一多半碗都拿出来了，一个人分给我们四两，红军吃盐都不忘我们，我们怎能忘记他们呢？”
    万安一部分农民被迫得上了山，每人带了两把小刀，反动派来抓时，就同他拼命，使得反动派凶＠，也收敛了一点。曾有一个乡地主逼着农民替他种庄稼，全乡农民约齐不种，地主请工也请不到，弄得毫无办法。就是在这样漫漫长夜里，凭着对敌人的仇恨，对共产党的热爱，农民们坚持下去了，直到了重见到自己部队的一天。
    我军解放江西时，老苏区很多农民拿出重重包裹精心用意保存的苏维埃时代的纸币，骄傲的拿给战士看，当有人在惊奇的问：
    “这么多年，你们还保存得这样好啊！”
    他们带着不大高兴的口气回答：
    “这还用问吗？毛主席同咱们的队伍还会不回来吗？”
    （诚、威、忠、洪）
