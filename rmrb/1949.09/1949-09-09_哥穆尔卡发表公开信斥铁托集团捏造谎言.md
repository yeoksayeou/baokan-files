Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 8th: The People's Forum newspaper in Warsaw published on the 7th a letter from Gomulka to the newspaper's editor, refuting the article by the Tito group traitor Djilas. The letter stated: I saw in a booklet published in Yugoslavia, written in broken Polish, a summary of an article published by Mr. Djilas in the Yugoslav Battle Newspaper in June of this year. I learned that despite my resolute condemnation of the rebellious Tito group, Mr. Djilas is attempting to include me in the ranks of Tito's followers. Djilas slanderously abused my name. This further proves that the Yugoslav people are being deceived by the traitors of the Yugoslav Communist Party and are being separated from the revolutionary workers' movement by a wall of isolation. This fact can only expose the desperate situation the Tito group is in as a result of its rebellion and break with the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies. But no fabrication or vile abuse of others' names can improve this situation. On the contrary, lies and curses can only accelerate the arrival of the ending that the author of the article deserves.

　　哥穆尔卡发表公开信斥铁托集团捏造谎言
    【新华社北平八日电】波兰通讯社华沙讯：人民论坛报七日刊载哥穆尔卡致该报编辑的信，驳斥铁托集团叛徒德热拉斯的文章，信上称：我从一本用似通不通的波兰文写的在南斯拉夫出版的小册子上，看见载有德热拉斯先生今年六月在南斯拉夫战斗报上所发表的一篇文章的摘要，知道了尽管我已经坚决地谴责过叛逆的铁托集团，但德热拉斯先生却试图把我列入铁托的追随者的行列里。德热拉斯诽谤地滥用我的名字。这进一步证明：南斯拉夫人民正在受到南斯拉夫共产党叛徒的欺骗，被用一堵隔离的墙把他们和革命的工人运动隔开。这一事实只能够暴露出由于叛逆以及和苏联与人民民主国家破裂的结果，铁托集团所处的绝望的境遇。但任何捏造或卑劣地滥用他人的名字，并不能够改善这种境况。相反地，谎言和咒骂只能加速该文作者应得的结局的来临。
