Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 15th: The People's Liberation Army of the Northern Anhui Military Region, engaged in clearing out the remaining bandits in the Dabie Mountains, recovered the bandit stronghold of Jinzhai County on the 7th, capturing over 80 bandits alive. The remaining bandits fled, and the Liberation Army is pursuing them in separate routes. In the past few months, the Northern Anhui Military Region had focused on clearing out the remaining bandits in the plains, which allowed the bandits in the Dabie Mountains to survive and occupy Jinzhai County. In the process of clearing out the bandits in the plains, the People's Liberation Army achieved considerable success, eliminating over 8,100 bandits from April to early August through killings, injuries, and captures. After severely打击ing the remaining bandits in the plains, the military region established the Eastern Anhui-Henan-Hubei Bandit Suppression Command on August 25th, launching a comprehensive campaign to clear out the remaining bandits in the Dabie Mountains and the plains, with the goal of completely eradicating them. Jinzhai County was liberated in the autumn of 1947 when the People's Liberation Army marched into the Dabie Mountains. It was later occupied by local Kuomintang bandits. Although it was recovered several times, it remained one of the main strongholds of bandits in Northern Anhui until recently. This group of bandits massacred many government cadres and revolutionary masses, and plundered a large number of villages, causing the local people to hate them bitterly. The destruction of the Jinzhai bandit nest symbolizes the demise of the remaining bandits in Northern Anhui and removes a major scourge for the people.

　　[Broadcast from the North China New China Broadcasting Station, Yan'an, 15th:] Etoke Banner in southern Suiyuan Province has been completely liberated, and the reactionary armed forces in the area have surrendered to the Liberation Army one after another. Five companies of the former puppet security team and three companies of the special agent battalion stationed in the northern part of Etoke Banner surrendered to the Liberation Army in the Xinzhao area on August 5th. On August 29th, the Liberation Army defeated more than 300 bandits from the 13th Brigade in the Shalabulu area. Now, the Liberation Army is cooperating with the direct detachment of the Ik Zhao League Detachment to pursue and annihilate the fleeing enemy to the west.

　　捣毁大别山区残匪巢穴
　  皖北我军收复金家寨
　  绥南鄂托克旗全境解放
    【新华社南京十五日电】清剿大别山区残匪的皖北军区人民解放军，于七日收复残匪巢穴金家寨县城，生俘匪八十余名，余匪逃窜，解放军正分路追剿中。皖北军区曾于过去数月中着重对平原地区残匪进行清剿，因而大别山区残匪得以苟延残喘，并窜踞金家寨县城。在清剿平原地区中，人民解放军曾获得不少成绩，计自四月份起至八月上旬止共毙伤俘残匪八千一百余名。该军区予平原地区残匪严重打击后，即于八月二十五日成立鄂豫皖东线剿匪指挥部，展开对大别山区及平原残匪的全面清剿，以最后肃清残匪。金家寨县城在一九四七年秋人民解放军进军大别山时即曾解放，后为国民党地方土匪侵占，中间虽经数度收复，但不久以前仍为皖北土匪的主要巢穴之一。该股土匪曾屠杀许多政府干部和革命群众，焚掠大批村庄，当地人民恨之入骨。金家寨匪巢的捣毁，象征皖北残匪的覆灭，为人民除一大害。
    【北平新华广播电台广播】延安十五号消息：绥远省南部的鄂托克旗已经全部解放，该地的反动武装纷纷向解放军投诚。原驻鄂托克旗北部的伪保安队五个连和特务营三个连，八月五号在新召地区向解放军投诚。八月二十九号解放军在沙拉布鲁都一带又打垮了匪十三旅三百多人。现在解放军正配合伊克昭盟支队直属大队，向西追歼逃敌。
