Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 16th: According to TASS, Soviet miners are launching a production surge, determined to complete the five-year plan's coal production target ahead of schedule. According to the plan, the total coal output of the Soviet Union should reach 250 million tons by 1950, exceeding the pre-war level by 51 percent. Messages from various regions around the Soviet Miner's Day (August 26) indicate that a coal production surge is developing. The Moscow region mining area's production level has reached an unprecedented high this summer. The "Moscow Coal Mine" Trust completed eight months of production by August 12. The production rate of other mines in the state in July has exceeded the pre-war level. The Chelyabinsk coal mine has completed its eight-month plan, and three coal mining trusts have produced dozens of trainloads of coal from the September plan. In the Donets Basin, the center of the Soviet coal mining industry, the miners of the Stalino Oblast, who had previously guaranteed to Stalin that they would produce an extra 300,000 tons of coal this year, completed their guarantee in mid-August and then launched a competition to reach the 1950 coal production target. Dozens of mine pits have already reached this goal, and are now engaged in a struggle to complete the total coal production target of the entire five-year plan ahead of schedule.

　　　　The Entire Coal Production Process Has Been Mechanized
    The increase in coal production is proceeding simultaneously with the mechanization of the production process. The new-style mine pits opened in the Donbass are equipped with the latest coal mining machines and tools. The entire coal production process, from excavation to loading onto railway trucks, has been mechanized. The adoption of "Donbass" type combined machines and other new machines has eliminated the hard labor of old-fashioned coal mining and loading. Powerful conveyors transport the coal away from the coal seam, and machines are used to load the coal from the conveyors onto coal trucks, which are transported to the surface by electric cranes when they reach the bottom of the pit. In this way, the labor productivity of miners has been greatly improved. For example, in the No. 3 coal mine of the Anthracite Trust, labor productivity has increased by an average of 40 percent due to the complete mechanization of coal cutting. In the Moscow region mining area, highly effective coal mining machines, conveyors, electric towing machines, pneumatic coal mining machines and combined coal mining machines have also been installed, almost completely eliminating manual labor in the mine pits. Very novel equipment—fluorescent lamps—has recently been adopted in the mine pits. Miners can walk in the underground corridors without using lamps. At present, the mechanization of coal mine production in the Soviet Union has exceeded the pre-war level. Mechanization has reached 99.7 percent in coal cutting, 84 percent in coal transportation, and 96.9 percent in loading. Labor competitions and new suggestions from workers in production have played a great role in increasing production and improving labor productivity.

　　　　Coal Mine Safety Equipment is Also Constantly Improving
    At the same time, safety equipment in coal mines is also constantly improving. In the first half of this year, more than 125 million rubles have been spent on coal mine safety equipment. Ventilators and cement steel supports have been widely installed. Recently, the Geological Research Institute of the Soviet Academy of Sciences has made new developments in methods of eliminating methane gas in coal seams that are harmful to the health of miners. Soviet scientists use specially drilled channels to lead the methane gas to the surface. Tests in the Kuznetsk mining area have shown that a very deep channel can eliminate 700 to 1,000 cubic meters of methane gas per day.
    Under these circumstances, the lives and welfare of miners have also been greatly improved. Miners' wages in the first half of this year increased by more than 5 percent compared with the same period last year. Last year and this year, miners with longer working ages and no mistakes in their work received more than 500 million rubles in bonuses. The living space of miners' housing is constantly increasing. In the first half of this year, 885,900 square meters of living space were built, double the amount in the same period last year. Cultural palaces, clubs, Young Pioneer homes, theaters, cinemas, sports grounds, libraries, hospitals, schools, etc. in mining areas are being greatly increased. On holidays in the Donbass region, stores are crowded with miners, buying all kinds of textiles, clothing, shoes, socks, household items, furniture, motorcycles, radios, and automobiles.

### 苏矿工投入生产热潮　决心提前完成五年煤产计划

　　苏矿工投入生产热潮
  　决心提前完成五年煤产计划
    【新华社北平十六日电】据塔斯社讯：苏联矿工们正投入生产高潮，决心提前完成五年计划中的煤产计划。按照该计划，苏联煤的总产量到一九五○年应为二亿五千万吨，从而超过战前水平百分之五十一。在苏联矿工节（八月二十六日）前后自各地传来的消息，说明煤产高潮正在发展中。莫斯科州矿区今夏生产水平空前提高，“莫斯科煤矿”托拉斯在八月十二日即已完成八个月生产。该州其他各矿七月份生产率已超过战前水平。车里雅宾斯克煤矿已完成八个月计划，有三个采煤托拉斯已产出数十列车的九月份计划中的煤。在苏联煤矿业中心顿尼兹矿区，斯大林诺州矿工过去在给斯大林的信中所提出的今年额外生产三十万吨煤的保证，已于八月中旬完成，而且接着就展开竞赛，以达到一九五○年煤产的目标。有数十个矿坑业已达到这个目标，现正进行着为提前完成整个五年计划中煤的总产量的斗争。
    　　　　全部煤产过程都已经机械化
    煤产的增加是与生产过程的机械化同时并进的。在顿巴斯开凿的新式矿坑，装备着最新式的采煤机器和工具，从采挖到载上铁路货车—全部煤产过程都已机械化了。“顿巴斯”式联合机和其他新式机器的采用，解除了旧式挖煤和装煤的辛劳。强有力的运送机把煤运开了煤层，再用机器把煤从运送机装上煤车，煤车到坑底时即用电动起重机运到地面上来。这样，矿工的劳动生产率就大大提高了，如无烟煤托拉斯第三号煤矿，由于切煤已完全机械化，劳动生产率即平均增加百分之四十。在莫斯科州矿区，也装置了效力宏大的挖煤机、运送机、电力拖曳机、空气挖煤机以及联合采煤机等，几乎全部取消了矿坑中的人力，最近矿坑中采用了非常新颖的设备—日光灯，矿工不需要用灯可以在地下走廊行走。现在，全苏煤矿生产机械化业已超过战前水平。切煤方面已达到百分之九十九点七的机械化，运煤百分之八十四，装车百分之九十六点九。劳动竞赛和职工在生产中的新建议，在增产和提高劳动生产率上起了极大的作用。
    　　　　煤矿安全设备也在不断改善
    同时，煤矿中的安全设备也在不断改善中，今年上半年为煤矿安全设备所耗的款项已超过一亿二千五百万卢布。通风器、水泥钢骨的支柱业已广泛设置，最近苏联科学院地质研究所在排除煤层中有害矿工健康的沼气的方法上已有新的发展。苏联科学家用特别钻凿的孔道把沼气引到地面上。在库兹涅茨克矿区试验结果，一个很深的孔道，每日可排除沼气七百至一千立方公尺。
    在这样情况下，矿工的生活和福利也大大提高了。矿工的工资在今年上半年较去年同期增加了百分之五以上。在去年与今年，工作年龄较长与工作中无过失的矿工共获得五亿以上卢布的奖金。矿工住宅面积正不断增加中，今年上半年建筑了八十八万五千九百平方公尺居住面积，较去年同期增加一倍。矿区的文化宫、俱乐部、少先队之家、剧场、电影院、运动场、图书馆、医院、学校等均大量增设中。顿巴斯区高级教育机关如顿尼兹工业研究所、医学院、师范学院和采矿及建筑学院等均已恢复。在矿区的假日，商店里挤满了矿工，购买各种织品、衣服、鞋袜、家庭什物、家具、机器脚踏车、无线电收音机及汽车。
