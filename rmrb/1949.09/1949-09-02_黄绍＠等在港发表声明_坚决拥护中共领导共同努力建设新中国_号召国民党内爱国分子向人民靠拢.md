Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 1st: This agency has received a statement from Huang Shao＠ and 44 others, issued in Hong Kong on August 13th, entitled "Our Understanding and Propositions Regarding the Current Stage of the Chinese Revolution." The statement severely condemns the reactionary Chiang Kai-shek clique for betraying Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People, relying on imperialism, and implementing fascist dictatorship. It expresses support for the New Democratic Revolution led by the Chinese Communist Party against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, and calls on patriotic Kuomintang members to immediately break with Chiang Kai-shek and his reactionary clique, resolutely and explicitly lean towards the people, and work together to build a new democratic China.

The statement, after citing Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary cause and revolutionary propositions, states: "Unfortunately, Mr. Sun Yat-sen's legacy has been hijacked by Chiang Kai-shek and his reactionary clique. Due to their erroneous leadership, the Kuomintang's recent measures have strayed further and further from the declaration and policies of the First National Congress. They rely on the embrace of imperialism while chanting national independence; they move towards fascist violent dictatorship while chanting democracy and freedom; they concentrate their efforts on developing bureaucratic capital while chanting improving people's livelihood. How ironic and absurd this is! The political corruption, economic collapse, and military defeat that this reactionary regime has brought about today are its inevitable results."

The statement continues: "The deeper the suffering of the people, the stronger their demand for revolution. Because of this, the Chinese Communist Party has grown stronger, and New Democracy has emerged. This is a turning point in Chinese history. The essence of Chinese society has not changed, and the basic demands of the people's revolution will not change. Mr. Mao Zedong, in response to this objective situation, advocated New Democracy, aiming to eliminate imperialism, feudal forces, and bureaucratic capital on the one hand, and to unite the working class, peasant class, petty bourgeoisie, and national bourgeoisie on the other hand, to form a domestic united front under the leadership of the working class, and to develop from this to establish a people's democratic dictatorship state led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance, so that China can move towards independence, democracy, freedom, and progress. This precisely conforms to the objective requirements of the Chinese revolution, and therefore has won the widespread support of the people. Undoubtedly, the Chinese Communist Party has already gained the leading position in the Chinese revolution, and New Democracy has become the guiding principle for nation-building accepted by the people."

Regarding the evolution of the situation since January of this year, the statement points out: "After the Political Consultative Conference was sabotaged by the reactionaries, and when their military strength was already in the dominant position, the Chinese Communist Party still accepted the peace proposals of the reactionary regime in January of this year. This shows their emphasis on the people's demand for peace. Therefore, the responsibility for sabotaging peace lies with Chiang Kai-shek and his reactionary clique, who vainly attempt to maintain their reactionary forces. After sabotaging peace, in order to maintain the vested interests of a very small number of people, they still attempt to make a final dying struggle, and do not hesitate to further engage in insane and perverse actions, disregarding the lives and property of the majority of the people. Bombing cities, blockading seaports, issuing silver yuan notes indiscriminately, and arresting and killing peaceful democrats, professors, and students – all kinds of crimes are aimed at being enemies of the people. In particular, Chiang Kai-shek's personal flight to Biao and South Korea,卑賤地卑賤地沦为殖民地的行列,妄想成立太平洋同盟,以求苟延残喘于帝国主义卵翼之下,更为可耻的罪行.”

The statement concludes by issuing a call to patriotic elements within the Kuomintang: "We should be thoroughly awakened, we should immediately break with the reactionary party authority and regime, and reunite to form a new revolutionary driving force, resolutely and clearly lean towards the people, follow Mr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings, thoroughly cooperate with the Chinese Communist Party, continue to strive for the development of the revolutionary Three Principles of the People, and work together to build a new democratic China."

The list of 44 people who signed the statement is as follows: Huang Shao＠, He Yaozu, Long Yun, Luo Yiqun, Liu Fei, Liu Jianxu, Li Renren, Hu Shuhua, Shu Zongliu, Li Jue, Zhou Yizhi, Li Mo'an, Pan Yuquan, Qin Yizhi, Zhang Qianhua, Chen Xiaocen, Li Jianting, Zhu Huiqing, Huang Tong, Jin Shaoxian, Gao Zongyu, Chen Rudan, Li Zongli, Yang Yuqing, Tang Honglie, Yang Dezhao, Mai Chaochu, Lin Shizeng, Huang Xiang, Luo Jiezi, Mao Jianwu, Zhu Ping, Luo Meilun, Li Jiong, Zhu Jing, Qu Suiru, Luo Dafan, Guo Hanming, Xu Tianshen, Liu Shaowu, Wang Huimin, Guo Weibai, Huang Yao, Peng Juezhi.

### 黄绍＠等在港发表声明　坚决拥护中共领导共同努力建设新中国　号召国民党内爱国分子向人民靠拢

　　黄绍＠等在港发表声明
  　坚决拥护中共领导共同努力建设新中国
  　号召国民党内爱国分子向人民靠拢
    【新华社北平一日电】本社顷收到黄绍＠等四十四人于八月十三日在香港发表的题为“我们对于现阶段中国革命的认识与主张”的声明一件。该件严斥蒋介石反动集团背叛孙中山先生的三民主义，投靠帝国主义，实行法西斯独裁，表示拥护中国共产党所领导的反帝国主义、反封建主义、反官僚资本主义的新民主主义革命，并号召有爱国心的国民党员立刻与蒋介石及其反动集团决裂，坚决地明显地向人民靠拢，为建设新民主主义的新中国而共同努力。
    声明在引述孙中山先生的革命事业和革命主张后称：“不幸，中山先生的遗产，竟给蒋介石及其反动集团所劫持。由于他们谬误的领导，致使中国国民党晚近的措施，与第一次代表大会宣言及其政策，愈趋愈远。他们投靠于帝国主义的怀抱，而高唱民族独立；他们走向法西斯的暴力独裁，而高唱民主自由；他们集中全力于发展官僚资本，而高唱民生改善，这是何等的讽刺，何等的荒谬！这一反动政权之所以招致了今日这种政治腐烂，经济崩溃与军事惨败，实为其必然的结果。”
    声明续称：“人民所受的痛苦愈深切，人民革命的要求也就愈强烈。以此，中国共产党壮大了，新民主主义产生了。这是中国历史的转捩点。中国社会的本质没有变，人民革命的基本要求就不会变。毛泽东先生针对这一客观形势，倡导新民主主义，一面要消灭帝国主义，封建势力与官僚资本；一面要团结工人阶级，农民阶级，小资产阶级和民族资产阶级，在工人阶级领导之下，结成国内的统一战线，并且由此发展到建立工人阶级领导的以工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政的国家，使中国走向独立民主自由进步的路上去。这正符合中国革命的客观要求，所以获得了人民大众普遍支持。无疑的，中国共产党已经取得中国革命的领导地位，新民主主义已经变成人民大众所接受的建国指针。”
    关于今年一月以来的时局演变声明指出：“中国共产党在政治协商会议被反动派破坏了以后，在他们的军事力量已经居于优势的时候，仍于本年一月接受反动政权的和平建议，这可以看出他们对人民要求和平的重视。因此破坏和平的责任者，实是妄想保持反动力量的蒋介石及其反动集团。他们在破坏和平以后，为了极少数人既得利益的保持，仍图作最后的垂死的挣扎，并不惜进一步的疯狂的倒行逆施，置大多数人民的生命财产于不顾。轰炸城市，封锁海港，滥发银元券及捕杀和平民主人士教授学生等，种种罪愆，无一不以人民为敌。尤其是蒋介石亲飞碧瑶南韩，卑贱地自沦于殖民地的行列，妄想成立太平洋同盟，以求苟延残喘于帝国主义卵翼之下，更为可耻的罪行。”
    声明最后向国民党内的爱国分子发出号召说：“我们应该彻底觉悟，我们应该立刻与反动的党权政权决绝，从新团结起来凝成一个新的革命动力，坚决地明显地向人民靠拢，遵照中山先生的遗教，与中国共产党彻底合作，为革命的三民主义之发展而继续奋斗，为建设新民主主义的新中国而共同努力。”
    署名于该声明的四十四人名单如下：黄绍＠、贺耀组、龙云、罗翼群、刘斐、刘建绪、李任仁、胡庶华、舒宗鎏、李觉、周一志、李默庵、潘裕昆、覃异之、张潜华、谌小岑、李荐廷、朱惠清、黄统、金绍先、高宗禹、陈汝丹、李宗理、杨玉清、唐鸿烈、杨德昭、麦朝枢、林式增、黄翔、骆介子、毛健吾、祝平、骆美轮、李炯、朱敬、瞿绥如、罗大凡、郭汉鸣、徐天深、刘绍武、王慧民、郭威白、黄耀、彭觉之。
