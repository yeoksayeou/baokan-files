　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 8th: The Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently sent a telegram to the field armies on the front lines, the Southern People's Armed Forces, and people from all walks of life to express congratulations on the continuous victories on the military front lines. The congratulatory telegram stated:

　　Comrades Peng Dehuai, Zhang Zongxun, and Zhao Shoushan of the First Field Army of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Comrades Liu Bocheng, Deng Xiaoping, and Zhang Jichun of the Second Field Army, Comrades Chen Yi, Rao Shushi, Su Yu, and Tan Zhenlin of the Third Field Army, Comrades Lin Biao, Luo Ronghuan, Deng Zihui, and Tan Zheng of the Fourth Field Army, all commanders and fighters of the field armies, People's Liberation Army and compatriots from all walks of life in various parts of the South:

　　Our heroic People's Liberation Army has been ordered to march south and northwest in a large-scale offensive for more than four months. In addition to completing the first phase of the plan, liberating the entire provinces of Jiangsu, Anhui, and Zhejiang, the northeastern and northern parts of Jiangxi, most of Hubei and Shaanxi, the remaining enemy-occupied areas of Shanxi and northern Henan, and the Qingdao area of Shandong, eliminating hundreds of thousands of enemy troops and liberating tens of millions of people, we have continued to advance, liberating most of Gansu and Qinghai, part of Hubei, central and northern Hunan, the entire province of Jiangxi, most of Fujian, and the Changshan Islands in the Bohai Sea, including the four provincial capitals of Changsha, Fuzhou, Lanzhou, and Xining, as well as major towns such as Ganzhou, Changde, Yichang, and Tianshui, eliminating a large number of enemy troops and liberating vast numbers of people. During this period, General Cheng Qian and General Chen Mingren led their troops in an uprising, standing on the side of the people, giving a major blow to the Kuomintang reactionaries, and powerfully coordinating with the advance of the People's Liberation Army. The victorious development of our People's Liberation Army in Guangdong, Fujian, Guangxi, and Yunnan provinces greatly threatens the rear of the Kuomintang reactionaries. Wherever our People's Liberation Army goes, all the people and democratic figures express their warm welcome and give the People's Liberation Army great help. Among them, the Hui compatriots in Gansu and Qinghai, like the Han compatriots, express a warm welcome and help to the People's Liberation Army. Our army's commanders and fighters have been on a long expedition, braving the sweltering heat, and inspired by the great and sacred aspiration to liberate the people of the whole country and unify the national territory, have completed a huge task in a short period of time with unparalleled heroism and self-sacrifice. The Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party expresses its warm congratulations and deep condolences. We hope that you will continue to work hard, complete new military and political tasks, and strive to eliminate the remnant enemy and liberate the people of the whole country.

　　Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party
