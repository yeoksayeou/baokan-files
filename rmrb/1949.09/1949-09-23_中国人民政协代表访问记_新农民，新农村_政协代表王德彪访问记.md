A Record of Visits with Representatives to the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference: New Farmers, New Villages: A Record of a Visit with CPPCC Representative Wang Debiao
Shen Yukao

Wang Debiao, a Northwest agricultural labor hero and model worker, is a brand-new farmer. Saying he is "new" is not because he is wearing new dark blue clothes and a new white towel, but because his thinking is new, his style is new, and the countryside he leads is new.

He is from Wangjiaping Village, Third Township, Jizhen District, Suide County, Northern Shaanxi. He is thirty-six years old this year. In old China, his father worked as a porter for others, and he herded sheep for others. In new China, he cultivates his own land, and his father herds his own sheep. In old China, the entire village had more than one hundred *qing* of land, and of the thirty households, only four had land, while the rest were all tenant farmers. In new China, the entire village has four hundred and sixty-eight *qing* of land, and none of the thirty-eight households are without land, and the vast majority have risen to the status of middle peasants. This is the difference between the old and new China that he told me.

Talking about supporting the war and restoring production, he said: "The main difficulty is animal power." Because during the Hu bandit invasions, ten of the thirteen draught animals in the village were lost. With less animal power, war service is inevitably heavy. So he came up with a method of "shared labor and shared wealth," mobilizing everyone to buy livestock together. Usually, they take turns plowing the land. When going out on war service, each animal is subsidized by everyone with six *jin* of grass and half a *jin* each of black beans and bran per day. Settlements are made regularly, and expenses are shared according to 60% labor and 40% wealth for the entire village. Encouraged by this method, the number of livestock in the entire village quickly recovered to its original number.

Before the Hu bandit invasion, the whole village had 140 sheep, but now there are none. They have planned to use twenty-six *shi* of millet to buy 260 sheep in Bao'an. He said, "Now that we have driven Hu Zongnan away, we must speed up construction, not only restoring everything to its original state, but also living better than before." Then he told me that he led the village's mutual aid team to open up eight *qing* of ancient graves and wild wasteland. In addition to collectively planting 500 fruit trees on these new lands, each household also planted 400 trees. In this way, they gradually lived better than before. This is the new life of green branches and leaves on the old ruins.

The topic naturally turned to the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. He expressed indescribable joy at being able to participate in such a grand meeting. He said, "If it weren't for the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, how could people from our remote village have reached this point!" He expressed his determination to resolutely implement the resolutions of the conference and work hard to develop production, "There are no big factories or big coal mines in our area, we can only do a good job in farming to support the national liberation war."

Regarding the work of Wangjiaping, he gave a detailed introduction, which made me feel that the village is the prototype of a new democratic countryside. Specifically, they have organized four cooperative undertakings: agriculture, textiles, education, and medicine. Each cooperative undertaking is closely linked to the production and life of the masses.

First of all, in terms of agricultural cooperatives, this year, of the thirty-two laborers in the village, except for half a laborer working in another village, the remaining thirty-one and a half laborers (accounting for 98.4% of the village's labor force) have all joined the mutual aid team. Mutual aid cultivation not only yields more, but also increases labor efficiency by about one-fourth to one-fifth compared to individual labor.

The thirty weaving women in the village have formed six groups by connecting relatives and neighbors. At the beginning, they only jointly purchased cotton. In February of this year, they took out their savings to organize a supply and marketing cooperative, selling groceries such as needles, thread, scissors, pliers, wooden combs, *bizi*, thimbles, and matches. Wang Debiao is responsible for safekeeping, and Wang Cheng is responsible for purchasing (both are voluntary). Whoever needs something goes to his house to buy it in the morning or evening.

Since 1944, Wangjiaping has organized reading groups and literacy groups, but they were virtually suspended during the Hu bandit invasion. In February of this year, they established a private primary school. The teacher's salary is two *shi* of rice. In addition to the one *shi* of rice subsidized by the government, five *dou* of grain are allocated from the charitable granary, and students share five *dou*. Students with two siblings attending school share the grain for one person, and students from other villages share half the grain for one person. Currently, the number of students has increased from five to fifteen, accounting for 71% of the school-age children in the village. Comrade Wang Debiao deeply feels the suffering of not being literate, and both of his daughters have enrolled in school.

Speaking of epidemics, Wang Debiao really "turned pale at the mention of the tiger." He said that in the past year alone, there were thirty-six cases of malaria, twenty-one cases of smallpox, and twelve deaths. The whole village suffered 840 workdays lost due to illness, and spent countless money on medicine and seeking divine help. Therefore, they also organized a medicine cooperative, allocating seven *dou* and six *sheng* of grain from the charitable granary to purchase quinine, eye medicine, smallpox vaccine, and other medicines. One person is responsible for safekeeping. Whoever is sick buys medicine at the original price and keeps an account, and the money is collected in the autumn and returned to the charitable granary. According to Wang, this scientific method of opposing superstition has been very effective.

　　中国人民政协代表访问记　新农民，新农村　政协代表王德彪访问记
    沈毓珂
    西北农业劳动英雄与模范工作者王德彪，是一个崭新的农民，说他“新”，并不是因为他穿着新的深蓝色的衣服，包着新的白毛巾，而是说他的思想新，作风新，以及他所领导的农村新。
    他是陕北绥德县吉镇区第三乡王家坪村人，今年三十六岁，在旧中国，他父亲给人家扛活，他给人家放羊，在新中国他种着自己的地，他父亲放着自己的羊；在旧中国全村有地百余垧，三十户中除四户有地外，其余全是佃户，在新中国全村有地四百六十八垧，三十八户中没有一家没地的，并且绝大部分上升为中农。这就是他告诉我的新旧中国的差别。
    谈到支援战争与恢复生产方面，他说：“主要困难是畜力”。因为胡匪进犯期间，全村十三头耕畜中，减少了十头，畜力少，战勤必然重。于是他想出了一种“劳财共负”的办法，动员大家合股买牲口，平时轮流耕地，出战勤时，每头牲口每天由大家补助草六斤，黑豆麸子各半斤，定期结算，按全村劳动力六成财富四成均摊。在此办法的鼓励下，现全村牲口很快的恢复至原来的数目。
    胡匪进犯前，全村有羊一百四十只，但现在一只也没有了，他们已筹划出小米二十六石，准备到保安买羊二百六十只。他说：“把胡宗南打跑了，我们要赶快的建设，不只恢复原来的一切，还要比从前过的更好。”接着他告诉我他领导全村变工队，开了八垧古坟野荒地，除在这些新的土地上集体栽种了五百棵果木树外，各家并分栽四百棵。这样他们就逐渐地比从前过的更好。这就是在旧的废墟上青枝绿叶的新生。
    话题很自然的转到中国人民政协上来，他对他能够参加这样的开会盛典，表现了无法形容的高兴。他说：“要不是共产党毛主席，咱这土圪瘩里的人怎能到这一步！”他表示要坚决执行大会决议，努力发展生产，“咱那个地方也没有大工厂，也没有大煤矿，只有把庄稼做好，支援全国解放战争。”
    对于王家坪的工作，他曾做了一个详细的介绍，这使我感觉到该村正是一个新民主主义农村的雏形。具体表现在他们组织了农业、纺织、教育、医药四项合作事业，每项合作事业，都紧密的联系着群众的生产与生活。
    首先在农业合作社方面，今年全村三十二个劳动力中，除半个劳动力在外村揽工外，其余三十一个半劳动力（占全村劳动力百分之九十八点四），都参加了变工队，变工耕作不但产量多，而且劳动效率约较个体劳动高四分之一至五分之一。
    全村三十个纺妇，亲凑亲，邻凑邻的结合了六个小组，开始时仅是合伙购买棉花，今年二月间，她们又拿出自己的体己钱，组织了一个供销性质的合作社，经售针、线、剪、钳、木梳、篦子、顶针、火柴等杂货，由王德彪任保管，王成任采买（二人均系义务职），谁需要什么，一早一晚到他家去买。
    从一九四四年以来，王家坪就组织了读报组与识字组，但在胡匪进犯期间，无形停止了。今年二月间他们又建立了一个民办小学，教师薪金米两石，除公家贴米一石外，由义仓内拨粮五斗，学生分摊五斗，弟兄二人入学者摊一人的粮，外村入学者摊半人的粮，现学生已由五名扩大至十五名，占全村学龄儿童百分之七十一。王德彪同志深感自己不识字的苦恼，他的两个女孩子都入学了。
    说到疫病方面，王德彪真有些“谈虎变色”，他说仅去年一年，打摆子的（疟疾）就有大小三十六口，害天花的有二十一个，死了十二个。全村害病误工八百四十个，吃药求神花钱无数。因此他们又组织了个药社，由义仓内拨粮七斗六升，购买奎宁、眼药、牛痘苗等药，由一人保管，谁家害病，按原价买药记帐，秋后收款归还义仓。据王说：用这种科学办法来反对迷信，收效很大。
