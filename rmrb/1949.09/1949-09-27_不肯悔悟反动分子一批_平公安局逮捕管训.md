Beijing Public Security Bureau Arrests and Subjects to Control and Re-education a Batch of Reactionary Elements Refusing to Repent

[Beijing News] In order to implement the resolution of the Beijing Municipal People's Representatives Conference to resolutely suppress counter-revolutionaries, the Municipal Public Security Bureau has arrested and subjected to control and re-education one hundred and forty-one reactionary party and league members and secret agents who resisted registration or continued to engage in conspiratorial activities after registration. Most of these people repeatedly attempted to hide and failed to register. Some, while superficially completing the registration procedures, were extremely cunning at heart, downplaying their crimes and refusing to thoroughly confess their guilt or hand over their organizations, weapons, and documents, such as He Zhenhua, executive member of the Kuomintang's pseudo-Beiping Municipal Party Department, and Liu Zhian, a Central Statistics Bureau (CC Clique) secret agent. Some had systematically destroyed archives and documents in advance, refusing to sincerely submit to the people, such as Qian Yunnian, a top-level military intelligence agent, a favored disciple of Dai Li, and the person in charge of the pseudo-"China Youth Mutual Aid Society," who consistently instigated and disrupted student movements. After liberation, he disguised himself as a progressive at Peking Union Medical College, opposed leaning to one side, touted the third route, and蛊惑 (bewitched/seduced) some young students. Some reactionary elements even persisted in their reactionary stance, resisted registration, threatened the masses, and conspired to carry out sabotage activities, such as military intelligence agent Dong Qichang and CC Clique secret agent Han Zishou. Other reactionary party and league members and secret agents who resisted registration, or were not honest after registration, or continued their activities, harboring hatred and opposition towards the people and the revolution, including Wang Chongjing and Liu Yunbiao, totaling one hundred and forty-one people, have all been arrested and subjected to control and re-education by the Public Security Bureau.

　　不肯悔悟反动分子一批
  　平公安局逮捕管训
    【平市讯】市公安局为贯彻平市各界代表会议坚决镇压反革命分子的决议，对抗拒登记、或登记后仍阴谋活动的反动党团人员及特务分子一百四十一名予以逮捕管训。在这些人中，大部还一再企图隐匿，不来登记。有的在表面上虽然履行了登记手续，但其骨子里则狡诈异常，避重就轻，不肯彻底坦白其罪行，交出其组织、武器、文件，如国民党伪北平市党部执行委员贺振华、中统特务刘植安等。有的则在事先有计划的毁灭档案、文件，不肯向人民真心实意低头，如军统大特务头子戴笠得意门生、一贯策动破坏学运的伪“中国青年互助社”负责人钱宇年，于解放后在协和医学院伪装进步面孔，反对一边倒，吹嘘第三条路线，蛊惑部分青年学生。有的反动分子甚至仍旧坚持反动立场，抗拒登记，威胁群众，阴谋进行破坏活动，如军统特务董其昌、中统特务韩子绶等。其他抗拒登记，或登记后不坦白，或继续活动，对人民对革命抱仇视与反对态度的反动党团人员及特务分子，计有王崇敬、刘云标等一百四十一人，均由公安局逮捕管训。
