Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 22nd - In the past two days, several capitalist countries with close business ties to the Sterling Area have continued to devalue their currencies to align with the new value of the devalued British pound. Italy has announced that from the 21st, the lira's exchange rate against the US dollar will be devalued by one-third. The Netherlands devalued the guilder's exchange rate against the US dollar from 2.65 to 1 to 3.8 to 1, starting on the 20th. Belgium and Luxembourg, from the 21st, have respectively devalued the equivalent Belgian franc and Luxembourg franc against the US dollar from 43.77 to 1 to 50 to 1. Canada devalued the Canadian dollar against the US dollar from 1 to 1 to 1.1 to 1, starting on the 19th. Portugal devalued the escudo to 28.5 per US dollar starting on the 21st. The royalist fascist Greece devalued the drachma to 15,000 to 1 US dollar starting on the 20th. The Dutch-occupied area of Indonesia has also devalued the Indonesian rupiah by 30.5 percent starting on the 20th. Currently, of all the Sterling Area countries, only Pakistan has refused to devalue.

In the Soviet Union and the new democratic countries, the exchange rates against the British pound and other devaluing countries have been revised due to the devaluation of the British pound, in order to maintain the original value of each country's currency. The Soviet Union has announced that the ruble's exchange rate against the British pound has been increased from 21.2 to 1 to 14.84 to 1. The Polish zloty's exchange rate against the British pound has been increased from 1608 to 1 to 1115 to 1, and the Czechoslovak koruna's exchange rate against the British pound has also been increased from 8 to 1 to 5.6 to 1.
