The Military Commission Railway Department Formulates a Plan
　　Large-Scale Repair of Railways on Northern and Southern Lines
　　Stipulates Repair Standards to be Completed Before the End of October
　　[Our Newspaper's Report] The railways across the country, after the Kuomintang's extremely corrupt rule, generally existing lines had not been renovated for more than a decade, even decades, and new lines were hastily repaired, with many places being crude and simple. Therefore, the railways that are now open to traffic generally have many shortcomings. In order to cooperate with the completion of the increasingly heavy transportation tasks, the Military Commission Railway Department made a planned and step-by-step emergency mobilization on September 14 to implement "Large-Scale Repair of All Lines in the North and South," ordering the railway bureaus in the North and South to complete it before the end of October.
　　The Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways formulated the requirements and standards for the large-scale repair of northern and southern lines on September 12. In terms of lines, universally fill and repair roadbeds, clean and screen ballast, replace sleepers, and organize tracks and switches. In terms of bridges, install guard rails, and accelerate the construction of permanent steel beam concrete railway bridges that are under construction in the short term to replace temporary bridges. Some temporary bridges with too low a load-bearing capacity should be supported to increase the load-bearing capacity and gradually eliminate slow driving. In order to increase line capacity, it is stipulated that tracks should be extended and sidings and flag stations should be added. It is required that by the end of October, the running speed and the number of train pairs on each line should be universally increased. Stations and sections also need to repair or build new station buildings and strengthen water supply equipment.
　　The Beijing Engineering Section of the Pingjin Railway Bureau held an emergency engineering meeting on September 15, requiring that every screw and every rail spike within the section's jurisdiction meet the standards. Other places are also actively carrying out road maintenance and major repairs. We must lay a solid foundation for road maintenance so that the railway transportation industry can make great strides forward in the future.

　　军委铁道部制订计划
  　南北各线铁路大补修
    规定补修标准限十月底前完成
    【本报讯】全国铁路经过国民党极端腐败的统治，一般旧有线路都是十几年，甚至几十年未曾翻修，新修线路又因临时抢修，很多地方因陋就简，因此现已通车的铁路普遍存在很多缺点。军委铁路部为了配合日渐加重的运输任务的完成，特于九月十四日作有计划、有步骤的紧急动员，实行“北方、南方全线大补修”，限令北方、南方铁路各局在十月底以前完成。
    铁道部工务局已于九月十二日制定北方南方线路大补修的要求与标准。在线路方面，普遍进行填补路基，清筛道碴，抽换枕木，整理轨道、道岔等。在桥梁方面加装护轮轨，将一部分正在进行修建永久性钢梁混凝土铁桥，短期内加速修成，以代替便桥。一部分载重过低之便桥，设法加以支撑，以增加载重量，逐渐消灭徐行。又为了增加线路容量，规定要延长股道，增设侧线，旗站。要求在十月底，各线普遍提高行车速度和增加行车对数。各站、段并需修理或增建站舍，加强给水设备。
    平津局北平工务段于九月十五日，召开紧急工务会议，要在该段管内做到每一个螺丝钉，每一颗道钉都合乎标准。其他各地也正积极进行养路大修工作。要把养路的基础打好，使今后铁路运输事业能大踏步前进。
