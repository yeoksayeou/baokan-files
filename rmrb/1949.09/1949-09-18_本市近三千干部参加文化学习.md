[Beijing News] Nearly three thousand cadres in various organs and suburban districts of Beiping are participating in on-the-job cadre studies. Under the leadership of the Municipal General Study Committee, they have been organized into classes according to their political and cultural level and are conducting planned studies of theory, policy, and business. The learning situation of the cultural classes and spare-time schools in various organs and districts is reported as follows:

Those participating in cultural classes (large units establish spare-time schools) are cadres with illiteracy and low cultural levels. The main focus is on cultural learning, supplemented by current affairs and policy studies. A total of 2,858 people in the city are assigned to D classes (i.e., cultural groups), including the Municipal Party Committee, Municipal Government, Military Control Commission, General Trade Union, Public Security Bureau, Cooperatives, Trading Company, People's Bank of China Beiping Branch, and Youth League Committee and other organs, as well as eleven districts in the suburbs, totaling seventeen study units.

The thirteen units that are divided into classes for teaching have three different types: one is the Municipal Party Committee Spare-time School, divided into five classes (grades 1 to 5 of elementary school); the second is the Municipal Government Cooperative, divided into three classes (upper elementary, lower elementary, and literacy classes); and the third is the General Trade Union, the Military Control Commission, and various districts, etc., each divided into two classes (lower elementary and literacy classes, or upper elementary and lower elementary classes).

The courses in the cultural classes are: Chinese and number recognition for literacy classes; Chinese, arithmetic, and general knowledge for lower elementary classes; and Chinese, arithmetic, history, geography, and nature for upper elementary classes. In addition, there are political classes. Some teaching methods adopt fixed teaching materials (such as the report on revising the Party Constitution, A New Outlook on Life, The Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party, and Talks on Common Knowledge of the Chinese Revolution), while others generally adopt a large report format.

Regarding the leadership of cultural classes and spare-time schools, there are principals and dedicated people responsible for overall planning and promotion and inspection of the work. Each subject in the cultural classes has teachers (all part-time) who undertake teaching work. Some units, such as the Eighteenth District, also hire a complete elementary school teacher.

The learning system generally stipulates a daily one- to two-hour study plan, and some also establish attendance, leave, and bi-monthly testing systems. In addition, to assist students in their studies, the General Trade Union has also established a library (managed by the students themselves) and publishes a wall newspaper every week, publishing student articles.

Problems discovered in teaching and learning, such as teachers, courses, and teaching materials, have been resolved one after another. The existing cultural classes and spare-time schools will continue to be run, and leadership will be strengthened to establish more centralized and standardized spare-time schools.
