Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 19th:

    The Xi'an Masses Daily, the organ of the Northwest Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, recently published an editorial entitled "We Must Consciously and Earnestly Improve Our Working Methods and Leadership Methods." The editorial pointed out that although the situation in the Northwest has changed, the old rural working methods and leadership methods of our Party and government leading organs have not been significantly improved in the past three months. This is manifested in the fact that many organs do not keep time for meetings, do not make adequate preparations before meetings, resulting in wasted time; responses to and handling of problems are delayed and slow; they are not good at collective leadership and division of labor with individual responsibility, resulting in uneven workload; and work lacks planning and focus, thus forming bureaucratism, etc. The editorial said that the Northwest now has new conditions such as medium and small cities, factories, and transportation lines. If the old style and old methods are not changed, and phenomena such as sloppiness, fatigue, and carelessness are not overcome, and work efficiency is not improved, the work will inevitably be delayed and damaged. The editorial pointed out that in order to establish new, scientific working methods and leadership methods, it is necessary to:

    It is necessary to: Strengthen the accuracy, organization, and discipline of work.
    (1) Strengthen the accuracy of work. Under increasingly complex work conditions and heavy work tasks, there must be detailed and accurate plans, learning and mastery of business, establishment of a sense of time, and opposition to careless, casual attitudes and chaotic phenomena. (2) Strengthen the organization of work. The main thing is to improve the quality of leadership work, be good at grasping the key points while taking care of the overall situation to carry out the work; be good at selecting and using cadres, establishing a scientific division of labor and a system of individual responsibility, so that each cadre feels that they are in the appropriate position and dares to work responsibly, reducing the phenomenon of buck-passing and procrastination; the Party committee system must be seriously implemented, and the system of democratic centralism must be implemented; various specific work and life system rules such as office, meetings, receiving guests, etc. should be re-examined and stipulated. (3) Strengthen the discipline of work. In order to ensure the thorough, rapid, and meticulous implementation of the policies and decrees of the Party and the government, and to eliminate all procrastinating and perfunctory bureaucratic habits, it is necessary to establish centralized, unified, and strict discipline, clearly define rewards and punishments, so as to overcome all anarchist and undisciplined phenomena and eliminate the embezzlement and dereliction of duty by a few individuals, and overcome the deep-rooted sloppy habits of small producers. The editorial pointed out that in order to complete the task of reforming the old style and old methods, leading cadres at all levels and departments must fully develop democracy, listen to the opinions of the masses, establish a strict and regular inspection system, and use newspapers to develop criticism and self-criticism. But more importantly, it lies in learning. Only by studying Marxism-Leninism, studying Mao Zedong Thought, and improving the level of political thought and awareness can we eradicate the sloppy and fatigued work style and the handicraft-style working methods.

　　西安群众日报著论号召
  　改进工作与领导方法
    克服散漫疲塌现象提高工作效率
    【新华社北平十九日电】中共中央西北局机关报西安群众日报日前以“必须自觉地认真改进我们的工作方法与领导方法”为题，发表社论。该社论指出：西北形势虽已变化，但我们党政领导机关的旧的农村式工作方法和领导方法在过去三个月中却未有显著改进。这表现在很多机关开会不守时，会前不作充分准备，以致浪费时间；答复处理问题拖延迟缓；不善于集体领导，分工负责，以致忙闲不均；工作缺乏计划和重心，因而形成事务主义等等。社论说：西北现在已拥有了中、小城市、工厂、交通干线等新的条件，假若不改变旧的作风和旧的方法，克服散漫、疲塌、马虎等现象，提高工作效率，则工作一定要遭到拖延和损害。社论指出：为建立新的、科学的工作方法和领导方法，必须要做到：
    　　　　必须做到：加强工作的精确性、组织性与纪律性。
    （一）加强工作的精确性。在日益复杂的工作情况和繁重的工作任务下，必须要有详密精确的计划，学习和精通业务，建立时间观念，反对粗枝大叶、随随便便的态度和杂乱无章的现象。（二）加强工作的组织性。主要是提高领导工作的质量，善于抓住重点同时又照顾全面地来进行工作；要善于挑选使用干部，建立科学分工和个人负责的制度，要使每个干部都感觉自己处在适当的位置上，敢于负责地工作，减除推诿、拖延的现象；必须认真执行党委制原则，贯彻民主集中制度；应该重新研究和规定各种具体的工作和生活制度细则如办公、会议、会客等等。（三）加强工作的纪律性。为了保证彻底、迅速、丝毫不苟地执行党和政府的政策和法令，清除一切拖延、敷衍的官僚主义习气，必须建立集中、统一、严肃的纪律，严明赏罚，以克服一切无政府无纪律现象和清除少数分子的贪污渎职行为，并战胜根深蒂固的小生产者的散漫习惯。社论指出：要完成改革旧作风、旧方法的任务，各级各部门领导干部，必须充分发扬民主，听取群众意见，建立严格而经常的巡视检查制度，利用报纸展开批评与自我批评。但更重要的，还在于学习。学习马列主义，学习毛泽东思想，提高政治思想水平及觉悟程度，才能根绝散漫、疲塌作风和手工业式的工作方法。
