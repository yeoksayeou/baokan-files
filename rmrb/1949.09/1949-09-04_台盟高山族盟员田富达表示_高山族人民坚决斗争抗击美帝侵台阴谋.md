　　Taiwan League Member of Gaoshan Ethnicity, Tian Fuda, States:
  　Gaoshan People Resolutely Struggle to Resist the US Imperialist Plot to Invade Taiwan
    Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 3rd: Tian Fuda, a member of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League of Gaoshan ethnicity, issued a statement on the US imperialist plot to invade Taiwan, saying: The political proposition of our Gaoshan people is that all ethnic groups in the country are equal and have the right to autonomy, otherwise we will not be able to improve our lives and raise our culture at all. But we have clearly realized that these demands are absolutely impossible to achieve under the rule of imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries. Imperialists are bound to invade and oppress small and weak ethnic groups, and they will never give us any autonomy or equality. We know the suffering of black people in the United States and the people of the Philippines. Even in American movies, we can often see black people being oppressed, insulted, raped, tortured, persecuted, and slaughtered by white people. We also clearly understand that only under the new democratic New China can all our demands be realized. We are determined to unite with the people of the whole country to resist the aggression of US imperialism and completely eliminate the domestic reactionaries and build a New China. The US imperialists' attempt to occupy Taiwan will never be tolerated by the people of the whole country, and we, the Gaoshan people, must also rise up to wage a resolute struggle. The Gaoshan people have never been afraid of any sacrifice, are brave and good at fighting, and can endure the greatest hardships. If US imperialism dares to carry out armed provocations against us, we will do our best for the sacred war to defend our homeland, and believe that we will surely achieve a great victory.
    (Note: The Gaoshan ethnic group are the indigenous people of Taiwan. During the Japanese occupation, they suffered many massacres. Some ethnic groups have been exterminated. There are now seven surviving ethnic groups with different languages, no written language of their own, living a primitive life and very poor. The current population is more than 200,000.)

　　台盟高山族盟员田富达表示
  　高山族人民坚决斗争抗击美帝侵台阴谋
    【新华社北平三日电】台湾民主自治同盟高山族盟员田富达对美帝国主义侵略台湾的阴谋发表谈话说：我们高山族人民的政治主张是国内各民族一律平等，并有自治的权利，否则就根本不能改善我们的生活和提高我们的文化。但是我们已很明白地认识到，这些要求在帝国主义和国民党反动派的统治下，是绝对不可能实现的。帝国主义者必然地要侵略压迫弱小民族，他们决不肯给我们任何自治、平等。我们知道美国国内的黑人及菲律宾人民所受的痛苦，甚至在美国的电影上面都经常可以看到黑人被白人压迫，侮辱，奸淫，非刑拷打，迫害屠杀。我们也清楚地了解，只有在新民主主义的新中国下面，我们的一切要求才有可能实现。我们坚决和全国人民一道，反抗美帝国主义的侵略，并彻底消灭国内反动派，建设新中国。美帝国主义者妄图侵占台湾，全国人民决不容忍，我们高山族人民也一定要起来作坚决的斗争。高山族人民向来就不怕任何牺牲，英勇善战，能忍受最大的艰难困苦，如果美帝国主义胆敢向我们进行武装挑衅，我们便将为保卫国土的神圣战争尽最大的努力，并相信必然会得到伟大的胜利。
    （按：高山民族是台湾的原住民，在日寇统治时代曾遭受多次大屠杀，有些种族已被灭亡，现残存七个种族，语言互异，没有自身的文字，过着原始的生活很穷困，现有人口二十多万。）
