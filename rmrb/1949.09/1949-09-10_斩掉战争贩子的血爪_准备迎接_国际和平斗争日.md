Chop Off the Bloodied Claws of the Warmongers
    — Prepare to Greet "International Day of Struggle for Peace"
    The declaration issued by the Standing Committee of the World Congress of Supporters of Peace for the "International Day of Struggle for Peace" is a solemn and militant call to the people of the world, and it will immediately arouse a strong response among the people in every corner of the world. We, the Chinese people, must fully prepare to participate in the worldwide peace demonstration to be held on October 2nd! Let us use actions to express our solemn will, together with the people of the world, to resolutely defend peace and "no war," and to respond to the despicable conspiracies of the warmongers who threaten world peace!
    We clearly see that "peace is in danger," and war is already actually threatening the peace-loving people of the world. The arms race is underway, and American imperialism is building a series of military bases thousands of miles away from its own country, posing a threat to the whole world. Although the Second World War has ended, the imperialist armies are still stationed in Egypt, Transjordan, Iran, Greece, Indonesia, Vietnam and other countries. The North Atlantic Treaty has become a huge danger to human security. Imperialist military alliances preparing for a new world war are forming. The bandits are doing their utmost to restore the war industries of Germany and Japan, rearming the aggressors and murderers of West Germany and Japan, and they have never stopped their crimes against the Chinese people.
    We cannot but be seriously vigilant about the evil activities of this small group of imperialist murderous adventurers and their hired reactionaries in various countries to create a new war. But we also realize more clearly that all these conspiracies of the imperialists to create a new war do not at all indicate their strength. On the contrary, all this proves precisely that "the more difficulties imperialism faces, the more dangerous and adventurous their policies become, and they will adopt all forms of provocation," attempting to push mankind into an unprecedentedly cruel war in order to escape their crisis of death. We want to warn the enemy: the strength of the people of the world has far surpassed that of 1914 or 1939, and the organized strength of the people in more than seventy-two countries on five continents is already invincible.
    In China, we will never forget the bloody lesson of the Chinese civil war created by American imperialism and its running dog Chiang Kai-shek. First of all, we must chop off the bloodied claws extended by the warmongers. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and with the support of the people of the world headed by the Soviet Union, we, the Chinese people, must quickly and thoroughly eliminate the remnants of the Kuomintang reactionaries armed by American imperialism and liberate all of China in order to safeguard world peace and protect human life. Our national leader Chairman Mao Zedong has long ago clearly declared: "Internationally, we belong to the side of the anti-imperialist front headed by the Soviet Union." Resolutely opposing the imperialist war bloc and fighting for the liberation of our motherland and for lasting world peace is precisely the common aspiration and common goal of the Chinese people and the people of the world.
    We firmly believe that the united strength of the people of the world will surely smash the new war conspiracies of imperialism and force them to maintain peace. As the great Stalin said: "The people of all countries still have fresh memories of the horrors of the last war. The strength of the masses of people who advocate peace is so great for the followers of Churchill who carry out aggression that they cannot overcome this strength and cannot turn this strength to a new war!" Look! On the International Day of Struggle for Peace on October 2nd, we will act in unison with the people of the whole world to let the new war provokers know: the people of the world are angry! The power of the people is unconquerable! Whoever dares to play with fire will surely be burned to death!

　　斩掉战争贩子的血爪
    ——准备迎接“国际和平斗争日”
    世界拥护和平大会常设委员会为“国际和平斗争日”所发出的宣言，是向全世界人民的一个严肃的战斗的号召，它将在全世界每一个角落的人民中立即引起强烈的响应。我中国人民必须以全力准备参加在十月二日举行的全世界规模的和平大示威！用行动来表示我们同世界人民在一起坚决保卫和平、“不要战争”的庄严意志，以回答战争贩子们威胁世界和平的卑鄙阴谋！
    我们很清楚地看到了“和平在危险中”，战争已经在实际上威胁着世界爱好和平的人民，军备竞赛在进行着，美帝国主义正在距离其本国数千里之外建立一连串的军事基地，构成对全世界的威胁；尽管第二次世界大战业已结束，帝国主义的军队仍然留驻在埃及、外约丹、伊朗、希腊、印尼、越南及其他国家，北大西洋公约已经成为人类安全的巨大危险，准备新的世界战争的帝国主义军事同盟正在形成，匪徒们极力恢复德国和日本的战争工业，重新武装西德和日本的侵略者与杀人犯，并且他们还一刻没有停止其反对中国人民的罪行。
    我们对于这一小群帝国主义杀人的冒险家及其雇佣的各国反动派制造新战争的罪恶活动，不能不提起严重的警惕。但我们也更清楚地认识到帝国主义者制造新战争的这一切阴谋，丝毫不是表示他们的强大，恰恰相反，这一切正是证明了“帝国主义越困难，他们的政策就愈带危害性和冒险性，他们就会采取一切形式的挑衅”，企图把人类推入空前残酷的战争中去，以摆脱他们死亡的危机。我们要警告敌人：世界人民的力量已经远远超过了一九一四年或一九三九年了，五大洲七十二国以上有组织的人民力量，已经是再也不可被战胜的了。
    在中国，我们永不会忘记美帝国主义及其走狗蒋介石制造中国内战的血的教训，我们首先要斩掉战争贩子们伸出来的血爪。我们中国人民在中国共产党、毛主席的领导下，在以苏联为首的全世界人民的支持下，一定要迅速彻底消灭由美帝国主义所武装的国民党反动派的残余，解放全中国，以维护世界的和平，维护人类的生命。我国人民领袖毛泽东主席早已明白宣布：“我们在国际上是属于以苏联为首的反帝国主义战线的一方面”。坚决反对帝国主义战争集团，为我们祖国的解放并为世界的持久和平而斗争，正是中国人民与世界人民的共同愿望与共同目的。
    我们坚信，以世界人民团结一致的力量一定能够粉碎帝国主义新的战争阴谋，强迫他们保持和平。正如伟大的斯大林所说：“上次战争的惨象，各国人民记忆犹新，主张和平的人民大众的力量，对进行侵略的邱吉尔门徒们来说是如此强大，他们战胜不了这种力量，不能将这种力量转向新的战争去”！看吧！在十月二日的国际和平斗争日，我们将同全世界人民一致地行动起来，让新的战争挑拨者知道：世界人民愤怒了！人民力量是不可征服的！谁敢于玩火，他自己就一定要被烧死！
