Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 13th: New York dispatch: The American people continue to protest the police and fascist thugs' attack on the Robeson concert. Congressman of the American Labor Party and New York mayoral candidate Marcantonio recently wrote to Dewey, pointing out that Dewey himself is responsible for the shameful act of attacking a peaceful gathering. The New York State Executive Committee of the CIO unanimously passed a resolution condemning the Dewey government for being responsible for the Peekskill atrocities and condemning the whitewashing investigation by those derelict local officials. New York State Senator Moritt demanded the replacement of prosecutor Fanellis, because he not only condoned the atrocities, but also conspired with the instigators. The CIO Furniture Workers Union President Pizer and Secretary Perloth wrote to Truman and Dewey, stating that it is obvious that the atrocities were encouraged by the open collusion and support of the state police. In addition, the CIO Electrical Workers Union, Telegraph Workers Union, Jewish War Veterans Association, and the New York branch of the Newspaper Guild also lodged protests.

　　美工会领袖议员等续抗议法西斯暴行
    【新华社北平十三日电】纽约讯：美国人民继续抗议警察与法西斯暴徒袭击罗伯逊音乐会事件。美国劳工党众议员兼纽约市长候选人马肯托尼奥顷致函杜威指出：杜威本人应对袭击和平的集会的可耻行为负责。产联纽约州执行委员会一致通过决议，斥责杜威政府应对毕克斯吉尔暴行负责，并谴责那些失职地方官员们的粉饰调查。纽约州参议员莫利特要求撤换检查官法纳利斯，因为他不但纵容暴行，并与唆使者同谋。产联家具制造工人工会主席派泽尔和书记培尔洛致函杜鲁门与杜威称：很明显的，这次暴行受到州警察公开串通与支持的鼓励。此外，产联电气工人工会、电报电话工人工会、犹太人退役军人协会及报纸公会纽约分会亦提出抗议。
