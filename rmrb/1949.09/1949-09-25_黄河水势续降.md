　　Yellow River Water Level Continues to Fall
    [This City News] The Yellow River's water level continues to fall. The flow at Huayuankou was 5,000 cubic meters per second at 16:00 on the 21st, and dropped to 3,950 cubic meters per second at 06:00 on the 22nd. The upper reaches are also generally receding. However, below the Pinghan Railway Bridge in Henan Province, the flow is shifting south, eroding the滩面 (tan mian - river beaches/flats). From Taochengbu to Qihe in the lower reaches, the situation was tense on the 19th, but thanks to the courageous efforts of our Party, government, military, and people along the banks to reinforce the area, all 51 breaches were blocked. The Dongming Lake in Pingyuan Province is rising, and about 500-600 villages in Liangshan and Nanwang areas have been flooded. Vigorous efforts are underway to block the breaches.

　　黄河水势续降
    【本市讯】黄河水势继续下降。花园口流量廿一日十六时为五千秒立方公尺，廿二日六时降至三九五○秒立方公尺。上流各地亦普遍下落。但河南省平汉铁桥以下，溜势南移，冲刷滩面。下游陶城埠至齐河段，十九日一度紧张，经沿岸我党政军民奋勇抢护，五十一处漏洞均经堵住。平原省东明湖涨水，梁山、南旺一带，被淹五、六百村，正大力截堵中。
