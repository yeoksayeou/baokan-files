　　CCP Central Committee North China Bureau Organs Decide
　　Launch a One- or Two-Mi Relief Campaign
　　[This newspaper reports] In light of the severity of the disaster situation in North China this year, the organs of the CCP Central Committee North China Bureau recently decided to call on all staff members of its subordinate departments and offices to launch a one- or two-mi frugality and disaster relief campaign. At 7:00 AM on the 14th, a mobilization meeting of all staff was convened. Secretary-General Ping explained that North China had suffered successively from drought, floods, insects, wind, frost, and other disasters this year, with the flooding in Hebei Province being the most severe. He then pointed out: In the past, our Party, government, army, and people, under enemy division and blockade, organized production, practiced thrift, and self-salvation, and overcame many famines. Today, we have even more sufficient conditions and confidence to overcome disasters. Our Party and the democratic government have an inseparable blood-and-flesh relationship with the broad masses of people. The disasters of the masses are our disasters. Therefore, saving and relieving disasters through thrift is our unshirkable responsibility. He hoped that all staff members would respond to the Party's call and actively launch the one- or two-mi frugality and disaster relief campaign. After Secretary-General Ping's report, each branch immediately convened discussion meetings. In the evening, the general branch convened each branch for reporting. According to the attendees of each branch, all staff members unanimously responded to the call to immediately launch the one- or two-mi frugality and disaster relief campaign. Moreover, some comrades in some branches believed that one or two *mi* per person per day, only two *jin* of *mi* per month, was too small an amount, and hoped that each person could contribute five *jin* of *mi* per month. Everyone also proposed that while donating grain to relieve disaster victims, the internal organs should continue to implement the streamlined and thrifty movement that had been implemented in the past, such as saving water and electricity and office supplies, streamlining personnel, cherishing public property, and reducing repair costs, all of which should be adhered to in order to save expenses and reduce the burden on the people. Some branches proposed that new cotton-padded clothes would be issued this winter, and hoped that everyone could donate their old cotton-padded clothes from last year to help disaster victims without clothes, which was immediately unanimously agreed upon.

　　中共中央华北局机关决定
  　展开一两米救灾运动
    【本报讯】中共中央华北局机关鉴于华北今年灾情的严重，日前决定号召所属各部处全体工作人员展开一两米节约救灾运动。十四日上午七时，召开了全体工作人员的动员大会，由平秘书长说明华北各地今年曾先后遭受了旱、水、虫、风、冻等灾害，尤以河北省的水灾最为严重，接着他指出：过去我们的党、政府、军队和人民，在敌分割封锁下，组织生产节约自救，曾渡过了不少次灾荒，今天我们更有充足条件和信心，战胜灾害。我党和民主政府与广大人民有着血肉不可分离的关系，群众的灾害就是我们的灾害，因此节约救灾是我们义不容辞的责任，希望全体工作人员响应党的号召，积极开展一两米节约救灾运动。平秘书长报告后，各支部立即召开了讨论会，晚上总支召集各支部进行汇报，据各支部出席人谈，全体工作人员一致响应号召立即展开一两米节约救灾运动，并且，有些支部的同志还认为每人每日一两米，一个月才二斤米，数量太小，希望每人每月能拿出五斤米。大家还提出在捐献粮食救济灾民的同时，在机关内部应继续贯彻过去已实行的精简节约运动，如节用水电及办公用品，精简人员，爱惜公物减少修理费用等均应坚持下去，以节约开支，减轻人民负担。有些支部提出今冬要发新棉衣，希望大家能捐出去年的旧棉衣，用来救济无衣的灾民，立刻获得大家一致同意。
