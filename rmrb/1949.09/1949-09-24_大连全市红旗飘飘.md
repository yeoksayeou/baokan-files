　　Red Flags Fly All Over Dalian
    [Our Correspondent in Dalian, 23rd dispatch] Just as Lushun-Dalian [Luda] is holding an unprecedented industrial exhibition, news of the opening of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference has filled people of all strata, who are intensely implementing the two-year economic construction plan, with boundless enthusiasm for work. On the evening of the 21st, when the Xinhua Broadcasting Station broadcast a recording of Chairman Mao's opening address, factories, schools, organizations, groups, and collective dormitories were crowded with people listening. The Dalian Telephone Bureau immediately relayed this news to those inquiring about numbers. The Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China sent a congratulatory telegram that evening. On the morning of the 22nd, red flags flew from every household. The Lushun-Dalian General Trade Union's cultural troupe appeared on the streets, distributing special editions. The "Honest Words" (organ of the Soviet Military Headquarters stationed in the Lushun-Dalian area) and the People's Daily all published the opening news, Chairman Mao's opening speech, and speeches of various representatives. The People's Daily also published an editorial entitled "Welcoming a New Era in Chinese History." In the evening, it was heard that five organizations, including the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, the Youth League, and the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, held a celebration meeting at the Cultural Palace. People from all walks of life unanimously expressed that they will work hard to build and welcome the new China. Wang Shuzhuang, Chairman of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, said: "From now on, the workers have their own regime. We will strengthen unity, actively produce, and build a new industrialized China." Wang Qun, Vice President of the Lushun-Dalian Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, said: "This major event is a new encouragement to the world's peaceful and democratic forces headed by the Soviet Union, and Sino-Soviet friendship will be further consolidated and developed." Yuan Mingchao, a labor hero and director of the streetcar factory in Lushun-Dalian, said: "Under the leadership of the Party, the working class has struggled for more than 20 years, and today it has achieved the first step towards its goal. We must work harder to produce, save more raw materials, and learn from our Soviet big brother to build our new Chinese industry." With the convening of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and the birth of the Central People's Government, a new upsurge in economic construction in Lushun-Dalian will inevitably be triggered.
