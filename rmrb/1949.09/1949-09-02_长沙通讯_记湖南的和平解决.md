　　Changsha Dispatch
  　On the Peaceful Resolution of Hunan
    The peaceful liberation of Hunan is a great joyous event for the people of Hunan, and also a significant victory in the history of the struggle of the people of Hunan. Under the long-term rule of the Kuomintang bandit gang, the people of Hunan have suffered devastation for more than twenty years; especially in the last three years, the Kuomintang bandit gang has treated Hunan as a base for carrying out counter-revolutionary war, levying grain and conscripting soldiers, imposing exorbitant taxes and levies, plundering and extorting, coupled with the disasters of the pseudo-legal currency and gold yuan coupons, as well as various natural disasters, which have left the people of Hunan impoverished and destitute. After the White bandit Chongxi retreated to Hunan this spring, he was determined to grab a big share in Hunan, and massively looted and transported the materials of the people of Hunan. Before the liberation of Changsha, he transported as much as five million dan of grain alone, which pushed the people of Hunan to the end of their rope. The people of Hunan originally had a glorious revolutionary tradition. Although they have been under the cruel suppression of the Kuomintang in recent years, their resistance and struggle have risen one after another and continued. Since this year, on the one hand, they were forced by life, and on the other hand, inspired by the victory of the People's Liberation Army, the struggle of the people of Hunan to win liberation has become more acute. Struggles against grain requisition, against conscription, and against counterfeit money have spread throughout the region, and anti-bandit people's armed uprisings are scattered in the "Three Xiang and Seven Ze," totaling no less than one hundred thousand people. In order to strive for peace, the people of Hunan have more widely organized peaceful self-rescue movements. 500,000 citizens of Changsha held parades and demonstrations, putting forward slogans such as "The people of Hunan do not need war" and "War-mongers get out of Hunan," demanding a peaceful resolution in Hunan. Social celebrities from all walks of life in Hunan also semi-publicly printed peace declarations and launched signature campaigns to actively promote the realization of the peace movement. Although the White bandits adopted bloody means of cruel suppression against these just demands of the people of Hunan, arresting and assassinating patriotic democratic people, shooting students, and closing newspapers, the power of 30 million people in Hunan demanding peace and liberation could no longer be contained. This powerful people's revolutionary force is an important internal factor in the peaceful liberation of Hunan this time.
    General Cheng Qian's peace negotiations with the People's Liberation Army had already begun. When the People's Liberation Army crossed the Yangtze River and pointed directly at Hunan and Jiangxi, and the struggle of the people of Hunan to demand peaceful liberation and oppose Chiang and drive out Gui reached its peak, in June, General Cheng Qian, knowing that the general trend was irreversible and the people's hearts were with him, expressed to the People's Liberation Army that he was willing to stand on the position of opposing Chiang, opposing Gui, opposing war, and opposing false peace, and seek partial peace in Hunan based on the principles of the eight articles and twenty-four clauses of the domestic peace agreement; and requested both sides to send representatives to negotiate specific implementation methods. At the same time, General Chen Mingren, commander of the Kuomintang First Army Corps, also repeatedly issued statements supporting General Cheng Qian's peace proposition and assured the people of Hunan that, for the benefit of the people of Hunan, he would never fight for the interests of a few wealthy families and cause Changsha and the entire Hunan Province to suffer from the ravages of war. Our army, of course, welcomed this action, which was conducive to promoting the liberation war and the interests of the 30 million people of Hunan, and on July 22nd, dispatched a delegation to Hunan to conduct specific consultations with Generals Cheng and Chen.
    The development of the negotiations was smooth. After several consultations, General Chen Mingren, starting from the 2nd, ordered the First Army Corps and the security forces to move out of Changsha and all major traffic routes, leaving only the 232nd Division and the Changsha police and constitution temporarily to maintain law and order in Changsha. On the evening of the 3rd, Generals Cheng and Chen formally issued a telegram of uprising, declaring their departure from the Kuomintang Guangzhou reactionary government and their willingness to join the people's democratic regime under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. General Cheng Qian also issued a letter to the people of Hunan on the 4th, enumerating the various crimes of the Kuomintang's betrayal of the revolution and harming the country and the people over the past 22 years, and called on the military and civilians of the entire province to unanimously oppose Chiang and drive out Gui, so as to lead the peace movement in Hunan to the southwest and northwest, in order to shorten the war and quickly realize the liberation of the whole country.
    When the uprising telegram of Generals Cheng and Chen was issued, the 500,000 citizens of Changsha were overjoyed. All major and small newspapers published news and commentaries celebrating the peaceful liberation of Hunan and supporting the victorious advance of the People's Liberation Army in lengthy articles. They quickly organized a "Joint Committee to Welcome the Liberating Army" to prepare to welcome the People's Liberation Army into the city. On August 5th, when the People's Liberation Army entered Changsha, more than 100,000 citizens of Changsha went out of the city to welcome them eight miles away, shouting "Our loved ones are here" and "Great Changsha has turned over." On the evening of the 6th, the delegation of the People's Liberation Army entered the city one after another. More than a thousand representatives from all walks of life presented flags and flowers at Dongtun Ferry, ten miles east of the city. Generals Cheng and Chen also sent representatives such as Tang Xing to welcome them. When the delegation's dozen or so vehicles drove into the urban area, the masses cheered along the way, making it impossible to pass. Finally, they had to get out of the car and walk, entering the residence in the midst of the crowd. That night, after a short rest, they visited Generals Cheng and Chen separately. The representative Lin Biao congratulated them and expressed his respect. From the 3rd to the 10th, the city of Changsha was filled with the sound of gongs and drums, and firecrackers never stopped.
    In the process of this Hunan peace movement, the Chiang-Bai bandit gang spared no effort to sabotage with all kinds of conspiracies. They used terror and suppression against the lower-level people, and threats, inducements, and instigation against Generals Cheng and Chen and their subordinates. After the White bandit Chongxi retreated to Hunan, he reorganized the Hunan Provincial Government and replaced the original personnel; then reorganized the Hunan Security Team, depriving General Cheng Qian of his military power, and finally removed him from both his posts, forcing General Cheng Qian to go to Shaoyang alone, and handing over all military and political power in Hunan to General Chen Mingren. When the People's Liberation Army approached Changsha from several directions, and the White bandits fled to Hengyang in a panic, he promised to pay 80 large cannons and 200,000 silver dollars as a reward, asking General Chen Mingren to hold Changsha firmly and cover the escape of the White bandit army. On August 1st, Deng Wenyi and Huang Jie, the heads of the Kuomintang secret service, flew to Changsha from Guangzhou, ostensibly to welcome Cheng Qian to become a nominal examination president, but in fact to win over Chen Mingren. But these bandits all went bankrupt, leaving only a joke for the people of Hunan. The most interesting thing is that at this time, the White bandits in Guangzhou were still bragging and saying that there would be amazing good news on the Hunan-Jiangxi battlefield within ten days; he was indeed not lying, and in less than a week, the amazing good news of the peaceful resolution of the Hunan issue of the Cheng-Chen generals spread throughout the country.
    After the realization of partial peace in Hunan, the Hunan military and political authorities organized the "Hunan Provisional Military and Political Committee," with Cheng Qian as the chairman and Chen Mingren as the chairman of the Hunan Provisional Provincial Government, to continue to maintain the military and administrative orders during the transitional period. After the People's Liberation Army entered Changsha, it not only gave full respect to this organization, but also ensured that it truly had the power and authority. All areas within Hunan where the People's Liberation Army had not yet arrived would continue to exercise their powers temporarily. Therefore, the transfer, takeover, and reorganization of political powers at all levels and other military and political organs would be postponed until a unified agreement was reached between the representatives of both sides. In the future, the people's political power in the entire Hunan Province will, under the leadership of the Communist Party and with the assistance of Generals Cheng and Chen, jointly strive to thoroughly realize the New Democracy. As for the army issue and the First Army Corps under Chen Mingren, the original structure will be temporarily retained in its entirety, General Chen Mingren will still serve as the commander of the corps, and the troops will be concentrated in designated areas for rest and reorganization, and will be temporarily supplied by the People's Liberation Army in a unified manner. In order to cooperate in the battle and finally annihilate the remaining reactionary forces of Chiang and Bai, General Chen Mingren voluntarily proposed to thoroughly transform the army with the help and guidance of the People's Liberation Army, and quickly become a real People's Liberation Army. The people of Hunan unanimously praised the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army for their respect for the people's demands for peace and their unity and sincerity with the uprising authorities in this peaceful resolution of Hunan. People believe that this great political spirit of the Chinese Communist Party is an important factor for its victory and the support of the people across the country. Although partial peace in Hunan has been initially realized, there are still many arduous tasks ahead. Representatives from both sides are continuing to consult in order to reach a solution that is completely beneficial to the people of Hunan and the cause of national liberation. The reporter believes that partial peace in Hunan will surely stand as a brand-new example before all liberated areas in South China, Southeast China, Southwest China, and Northwest China, pointing out a correct path for them.

  　记湖南的和平解决
    这次湖南和平解放，是湖南人民一件大喜事，同时也是湖南人民斗争历史上一次重大的胜利。湖南人民在国民党匪帮的长期统治下，二十余年来饱受摧残；特别是近三年来，国民党匪帮把湖南当作了进行反革命战争的基地，征粮征兵，苛捐杂税，搜括勒索，再加上伪法币、金圆券的灾害，以及各种各样天灾，已使湖南民穷财尽。今春白匪崇禧退窜湘境之后，决心在湖南大抓一把，更大批地搜括和劫运湖南人民的物质，至长沙解放前，仅粮食一项即运走五百万担之多，这更把湖南人民迫到了绝路。湖南人民原是具有光荣的革命传统的，这些年来虽在国民党残酷的镇压下面，反抗斗争却此起彼伏，一直继续着。今年以来，一方面是生活所迫，另一方面受解放军胜利的鼓舞，湖南人民争取解放的斗争就表现得更加尖锐。抗粮、抗丁、和拒绝伪钞的斗争遍及各地，反抗匪帮的民变武装散布在三湘七泽，总数不下十余万人。为着争取和平，湖南人民更广泛地组织了和平自救运动，长沙五十万市民，并举行了游行示威，提出“湖南人民不需要战争”，“战争贩子滚出湖南”等口号，要求湖南的和平解决。湖南各界社会名流，也半公开地印发和平宣言，发动签字运动，积极推进和平运动的实现。对于湖南人民这些正义要求，白匪虽然采取了残酷镇压的血腥手段，逮捕暗杀爱国民主人士，枪杀学生，封闭报馆，但湖南三千万人民要求和平、要求解放的力量，是再也无法遏止了。这一强大的人民革命力量，就是这次湖南和平解放的重要内在因素。
    程潜将军和解放军的和平谈判，是早已开始了。当人民解放军横渡长江、直指湘赣，而湖南人民要求和平解放，反蒋驱桂的斗争发展到最高峰时，六月间程潜将军深知大势所趋，人心所向，就向人民解放军表示，愿站在反蒋、反桂、反战、反假和平的立场，根据国内和平协定八条二十四款的原则，谋取湖南局部和平；并要求双方派遣代表，协商具体进行办法。同时，国民党第一兵团司令官陈明仁将军亦历次发表谈话，支持程潜将军的和平主张，并向湖南人民保证，为着湖南人民的利益，决不为少数豪门打仗，而使长沙和湖南全省蒙受战祸。我军对此有利于解放战争的推进及湖南三千万人民利益的行动，当然极表欢迎，乃于七月二十二日派遣代表团，前往湖南与程陈两将军进行具体协商。
    谈判的发展是顺利的。经过多次洽商的结果，陈明仁将军自二日开始即按照解放军的要求，下令第一兵团及保安部队开出长沙及各交通要道，仅留二三二师及长沙警宪暂时维持长沙治安。三日晚程陈两将军正式发出起义通电，声明脱离国民党广州反动政府，愿在中国共产党领导下加入人民民主政权。程潜将军更于四日发表告湖南民众书，历数二十二年来国民党背叛革命祸国殃民的种种罪恶，号召全省军民一致反蒋驱桂，把湖南的和平运动引向西南、西北，以便缩短战争，迅速实现全国解放。
    当程陈两将军起义的通电发出后，长沙五十万市民真是欢欣若狂。所有大小报纸都连篇累牍地刊载庆祝湖南和平解放和拥护人民解放军胜利进军的新闻言论。他们迅速地组织了“迎接解放大军联合委员会”，准备迎接解放军入城。八月五日，当解放军进入长沙时，十余万长沙市民出城八里之外迎接，高呼“我们的亲人来了”，“大长沙翻身了”。六日晚，人民解放军代表团相继入城，各界群众代表千余人，更于距城十里之东屯渡献旗献花，程陈两将军亦派唐星等代表前往迎接。当代表团的十余辆车子驰入市区时，群众夹道欢呼，无法通过，最后只得下车步行，在万众簇拥中进入驻地。当晚，稍为休息，即分别拜访程陈两将军。代表林彪将军向其致贺与表示敬意。自三日至十日，长沙市内天天是锣鼓喧天，鞭炮声不绝。
    在这次湖南和平运动过程中，蒋白匪帮曾费尽心计百般阴谋破坏。他们对下层人民是恐怖镇压，对程、陈两将军及其部下则威胁利诱和挑拨离间。白匪崇禧退踞湖南之后，即改组湖南省政府，撤换原有人员；接着改编湖南保安队，剥夺程潜将军的军权，最后又免去他的本兼两职，强迫程潜将军单人匹马出走邵阳，而将湖南所有军政大权统统交给陈明仁将军掌握。当解放军数路大军迫近长沙，白匪狼狈逃窜衡阳时，他答应以八十门大炮、二十万现洋作为报酬，要陈明仁将军坚守长沙，掩护白匪军逃跑。八月一日，国民党特务头子邓文仪、黄杰更双双由广州飞长，名义上是迎程潜去当挂名的考试院长，实际上是来拉拢陈明仁。但这些匪徒们都破产了，只给湖南人民留下了一个笑柄。最有趣的是这时候白匪在广州，还大吹大擂地说，湘赣战场十日之内必有惊人的好消息；他确是没有骗人，不出一周，程陈两将军起义湖南问题和平解决的惊人好消息就传遍全国了。
    湖南局部和平实现后，湖南军政当局便组织“湖南临时军政委员会”、以程潜为主任委员，陈明仁为湖南临时省政府主席、继续维持过渡时期的军令行政。人民解放军进入长沙后，对于这一组织不仅予以充分的尊重，并保证其真正有职有权，凡湖南境内解放军未到之处，一律由其暂时继续行使职权，因此各级政权及其他军政机关的移交、接管、改组等问题，在双方代表未成立统一的协定之前，均暂缓进行。今后湖南全省人民政权，必将在共产党的领导及程陈两将军的协助之下，为彻底实现新民主主义而共同努力。至于军队问题及陈明仁所属之第一兵团，暂时全部保留原有建制，陈明仁将军仍任兵团司令，部队在指定地区集中休整，暂由人民解放军统一补给。为了配合作战，最后歼灭蒋白残余反动力量，陈明仁将军自动提出愿在人民解放军的帮助和指导下，予以彻底改造，迅速成为真正的人民解放军。全湖南人民对于中国共产党和人民解放军在这次湖南和平解决中所表现的对于人民和平要求的尊重，对于起义当局的团结、坦诚，无不同声赞扬。人们认为中国共产党这种伟大的政治气魄，正是他取得胜利，获得全国人民拥护的重要因素。目前湖南的局部和平虽已初步实现，但摆在面前的还有许多艰巨任务，连日来双方代表正在继续磋商，以便达到一个完全有利于湖南人民和全国解放事业的解决，记者相信，湖南的局部和平必将作为一个崭新的榜样，竖立在华南、东南、西南、西北一切待解放地区之前，为他们指出一条正确的道路。
