Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 19th: Former Kuomintang Northwest Military and Political Deputy Commander and Chairman of the Kuomintang Suiyuan Provincial Government, Dong Qiwu, and 38 others, today telegraphed Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, Commander Nie of the People's Liberation Army North China Military Region, and Political Commissar Bo, announcing their secession from the Kuomintang reactionary remnant clique and joining the people's democratic camp. The telegram reads as follows: Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, Commander Nie, Political Commissar Bo:

We, all officers and soldiers, and administrative personnel at all levels, today launched a glorious uprising in Suiyuan and solemnly announced to the people that we are formally seceding from the remnant clique of reactionaries, including Chiang Kai-shek, Li Zongren, and Yan Xishan, who rely on American imperialism, and resolutely coming over to the side of the people. The peaceful liberation of Suiyuan gives us a new lease on life. All the military and civilians extend our infinite loyalty and pay our highest respects to the people's leaders, Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu!

The success of the Peiping peace talks has enlightened us that peace is the urgent demand and wish of the people of the whole country; it has educated us that the past policy of suppressing bandits was wrong; it has reminded us that only under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, uniting all democratic classes and all nationalities to establish a people's democratic united front and serving the people, is the right thing to do. Therefore, after the Peiping peace talks, our urgent wish is to expect the peace of Peiping to promote the peace that the people of the whole country unanimously demand, and to quickly start the construction of new democracy under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party.

However, the facts prove day by day that the reactionaries have not the slightest awareness or repentance, but are intensifying their reliance on imperialism and begging for help from imperialism. The reactionaries and the wishes of the people are completely opposite. The people want peace, but the reactionaries are deliberately undermining peace. Yan Xishan ruined the lives of the people of Shanxi, flew from Taiyuan to Guangzhou, became the President of the Executive Yuan of the reactionaries, madly babbled about the so-called "Japanese revitalization of China theory," and actively engaged in conspiracies to collude with the reactionary factions of Japanese militarism, guiding Japanese robbers to invade Chinese territory again and slaughter the Chinese people again.

We participated in the Xinhai Revolution, we participated in the Great Revolution, and we especially persisted in the War of Resistance Against Japan from beginning to end, our hot blood spilling over all the passes of the Great Wall. During the Great Wall Resistance in the 22nd year of the Republic of China [1933], when the shameless He-Umezu Agreement was being signed, it was precisely when we were fighting hard against the Japanese aggressor Nishiyi Detachment near Huairou and giving them a serious blow. Following this, we fought in eastern Suiyuan, attacking the base of the Japanese aggression against Inner Mongolia in Bailingmiao. After the full-scale War of Resistance Against Japan broke out on July 7th, we participated in the Nankou Campaign on the Peiping-Suiyuan Railway Line, the Pingxingguan Battle in Shanxi, the Xinkou Battle, the defense of Taiyuan, and the various battles of Wenshui, Jiaocheng, and Lishi, the southern Suiyuan campaign, the counterattack on Baotou, and the recapture of Wuyuan. Although we lacked weapons and ammunition, we fought to the end. Although we ate horse feed and sand, we persisted to the end for the sake of national rejuvenation and national independence. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the people of Suiyuan ate inadequately and were poorly clothed, and all their savings were dedicated to the war. The people of Suiyuan took out their lives and blood and used all their strength to support the war. Our purpose in resisting Japan was to overthrow imperialism and strive for China's independence, democracy, freedom, peace, prosperity, and strength. Today, the reactionaries are colluding with Japanese robbers to slaughter the Chinese people again. We are indignant! We protest! We resolutely oppose it! Has the Kuomintang reactionary faction ever thought about what the purpose of Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People was? Why did the entire nation sacrifice countless lives and property in eight years of hard fighting? What will such perverse actions do to Sun Yat-sen! What will it do to the fallen martyrs!

　　　　Educated by many facts　Awakened from being deceived
All these facts have educated us and made us see that the reactionaries have reached the end of their road to death. In the past, when the reactionaries colluded with imperialism, they still used some flowery words to deceive the people. When the reactionaries were approaching death, they no longer cared about shame, but revealed their true colors, prostrating themselves before the feet of imperialism, wagging their tails and begging for pity, and vainly trying to make a dying struggle.

All these facts have educated us, awakened us from being deceived, and made us see that the interests of the reactionaries and the people are opposite, and the interests of the reactionaries and the revolution are opposite. The interests of the reactionaries and imperialism, the interests of bureaucratic comprador capitalists, and the interests of feudal landlords are originally completely consistent.

All these facts have educated us and made us understand that these three-in-one Chinese reactionaries of feudal remnants, bureaucratic comprador capitalists, and imperialist lackeys are traitors to Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary Three Principles of the People, and despicable and shameless national betrayers.

Now that we have understood from being deceived and freed ourselves from suffering and contradiction, we have no reason to fight for these selfish, shameless, and reactionary factions. We have no reason to violate our original revolutionary intentions, destroy the glory of the War of Resistance, and work for the reactionaries. We have no reason to be buried with the reactionaries, but must resolutely secede from the reactionary remnant clique and come over to the people! To serve the people!

After the Peiping peace talks, after half a year of self-reflection and self-education, we firmly believe that the Chinese people's democratic revolution must be led by the proletariat, based on the worker-peasant alliance, unite all democratic classes and all nationalities within China, establish a people's democratic united front, and work together to thoroughly complete it. This direction is completely correct. We deeply feel that only by striving under this general direction can we achieve the people's wishes and conform to our glorious revolutionary and anti-Japanese history. We are now launching an uprising in accordance with this correct direction, realizing peace in Suiyuan, seceding from the remnant clique of reactionaries such as Chiang Kai-shek, Li Zongren, and Yan Xishan, and resolutely coming over to the side of the people. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, we will work hard to study, transform ourselves, and join the people of the whole country to smash any conspiracy of imperialism to invade China, eliminate all remaining forces of the reactionaries, realize new democracy, that is, the revolutionary Three Principles of the People, and peacefully build a new Suiyuan and a new China. We eagerly hope that the people's leaders, Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and people from all walks of life will guide us and educate us so that we can faithfully serve the people in the new society! Let us shout long live the People's Republic of China! Long live Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu!

　　董其武等电毛主席朱总司令
  　宣布脱离反动集团加入人民民主阵营
    愿在中共领导下建设新绥远
    【新华社北平十九日电】前国民党西北军政副长官兼国民党绥远省政府主席董其武等三十九人本日致电毛主席、朱总司令、人民解放军华北军区聂司令员、薄政委，宣布脱离国民党反动派残余集团，加入人民民主阵营。电文如下：毛主席、朱总司令、聂司令员、薄政委：
    我们全体官兵，和各级行政人员，今天在绥远发动了光荣的起义，并庄严的向人民宣布，我们正式脱离依靠美帝国主义的蒋介石、李宗仁、阎锡山等反动派残余集团，坚决走到人民方面来。绥远和平解放，我们得庆新生，全体军民，谨以无限忠诚，向人民领袖毛主席、朱总司令致崇高的敬礼！
    北平和平的成功，启示了我们，和平是全国人民迫切的要求与愿望；教育了我们，过去戡乱的政策是错误的；提醒了我们，惟有在中共领导下，团结各民主阶级、各民族建立人民民主统一战线，为人民服务，方才是对的。因此，北平和平之后，我们迫切的愿望，就是期待由北平和平促成全国人民一致要求的和平，在中共领导之下迅速开始新民主主义的建设。
    但是，事实一天天证明，反动派没有丝毫的觉悟和悔改，而是变本加厉的投靠帝国主义，乞灵于帝国主义。反动派和人民的愿望，是完全相反的。人民要和平，反动派正是处心积虑的破坏和平。阎锡山断送了山西人民的生命，从太原飞到广州，当了反动派的行政院院长，狂吠所谓“日本复兴中国论”，积极从事与日本军国主义反动派勾结的阴谋，引导日本强盗，再来进犯中国国土，再来屠杀中国人民。
    我们参加过辛亥革命，我们参加过大革命战争，我们尤其自始至终坚持对日抗战，热血洒遍长城各口。民国二十二年长城抗战中，当无耻的何梅协定正在签字的时候，也正是我们在怀柔附近对日本侵略者西义一师团坚强奋战并予以严重打击的时候。继此之后，我们在绥东抗战，向百灵庙日本侵略内蒙的根据地袭击。七七全面抗战展开后，我们参加了平绥线的南口战役，山西的平型关会战，忻口会战，太原守城，文水交城离石各战役，绥南战役，反攻包头，克复五原。我们虽然缺乏武器，缺乏弹药，但我们打到底。我们虽然吃过马料，吃过沙土；但我们为了民族复兴，国家独立，坚持到底。我们绥远人民，在抗日战争里，食不果腹，衣不蔽体，一切的节约，供献了抗战。我们绥远人民，拿出了生命热血，用一切的力量，支持了抗战。我们的抗战目的，是为了打倒帝国主义，争取中国独立、民主、自由、和平、富强。今天反动派却又勾结日本强盗，来屠杀中国的人民。我们愤慨！我们抗议！我们坚决的反对！国民党反动派可曾想过革命的三民主义的目的是什么？全民族八年苦战牺牲了无数生命财产又是为什么？这样倒行逆施，将何以对孙中山先生！将何以对死难先烈！
    　　　　受了许多事实教育　从蒙蔽中清醒过来
    这一切事实教育我们，使我们看明白反动派已经走到了死亡的末路。在过去反动派与帝国主义勾结，还要用些花言巧语来欺骗人民。到了反动派临近死亡的时候，他们就再也顾不得什么羞耻，只有原形毕现的匍匐在帝国主义的脚前，摇尾乞怜，妄图作垂死的挣扎。
    这一切事实教育我们，从蒙蔽中清醒过来，看明白反动派和人民的利害是相反的，和革命的利害是相反的。反动派和帝国主义的利害，和官僚买办资本家的利害，和封建地主的利害，原来是完全一致的。
    这一切事实教育我们，使我们明白这些封建残余、官僚买办资本家、帝国主义奴仆三位一体的中国反动派，是孙中山先生革命的三民主义的叛徒，是卑劣无耻的出卖民族的败类。
    我们既然从蒙蔽中明白过来，从苦闷矛盾中解脱出来，我们就再也没有理由替这些自私自利无羞无耻的反动派作战。我们就再也没有理由违背革命的初衷，自毁抗战的光荣，而为反动派效力。我们就再也没有理由跟着反动派殉葬，而必须坚决地脱离反动派残余集团来向人民靠拢！来为人民服务！
    我们于北平和平之后，经过半年来的自我反省，自我教育，确切认定中国人民民主革命，必须是以无产阶级为领导，工农联盟为基础，团结各民主阶级、及中国境内各民族，建立人民民主统一战线，共同努力，才能彻底完成。这个方向是完全正确的。我们深深感到，只有在这个总的方向之下，努力奋斗，才能达成人民的愿望，才能符合我们革命抗战的光荣历史。我们现在就是依照这正确的方向发动起义，实现绥远和平，脱离蒋介石、李宗仁、阎锡山等反动派残余集团，坚决走到人民方面来。在中国共产党领导下努力学习，自我改造，和全国人民一起来粉碎帝国主义侵略中国的任何阴谋，消灭反动派一切残余势力，实现新民主主义，即革命的三民主义，和平建设新绥远，和平建设新中国。我们热切期望人民领袖毛主席朱总司令及各界民主人士指导我们，教育我们，使我们能在新社会中忠实的为人民服务！让我们高呼中华人民共和国万岁！毛主席朱总司令万岁！
