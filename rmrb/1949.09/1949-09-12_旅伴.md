　　Fellow Traveler
    By Soviet writer Panova, translated by Su Ling, proofread by Cao Jinghua
    Part One: Night
    Chapter Three: Doctor Bilov

    Once, the washerwoman brought her little daughter, who was three years older than Igor. She taught him to play with pebbles and noughts and crosses (note). Igor worshipped her. He always hugged her and kissed her. Sonia became jealous and asked:
    Note: A square is drawn on the ground, with small squares inside like a chessboard, and the squares are filled with noughts and crosses.

    "Who do you love the most? Elida, or me?"
    "Of course, Rita," he replied.
    But later the toys disappeared. Sonia didn't want to hurt her son's feelings, so she kept silent. Finally, she couldn't help it.
    "Little Igor, Rita is not a good child," she said. "You love her so much, but she has stolen all your good toys."
    He said nothing, went to the dining room, squatted down, and sat on a large sofa for a long time. Sonia said his eyes were filled with surprise and sadness at the time.
    Later, he got off the sofa, went to his mother and said:
    "Don't say she stole them. Okay? Just say I gave them to her. Let her come back here."
    Rita came again.
    When they were alone there together, Sonia heard Igor say to her:
    "If you like my toys, you can take them. Take them all, it doesn't matter. I don't want them."
    Good boy, good boy...
    When he was six years old, he stole money from his mother.
    He had beautiful yellowish-white curly hair. Sonia treasured it and didn't cut it for him. He begged to have it cut because he was being laughed at in the yard as a little girl. But Sonia, with maternal vanity and selfishness, replied:
    "Don't mind them, they don't understand anything. Just leave it for another year, just one more year!"
    So he sneaked out of the yard, and when he came back, he had a shaved head, with a strong smell of perfume.
    "Where did you get it cut?!" Sonia asked, staring at his suddenly rough and ugly face.
    She was about to cry.
    "I got it cut at the barbershop," he replied. "I gave them three rubles, and they sprinkled perfume all over me."
    "Where did you get the three rubles?"
    "I stole them from your wallet," he replied.
    "Why did you steal?" she asked in horror. "You should have asked me, and I would have given it to you."
    He shook his head.
    "No, you wouldn't have."
    So she no longer blamed him. She stroked his round, velvety boy's head, weeping for the cut curls, and kissed him, kissed him, with boundless, frantic motherly love...
    There was a young female teacher at school who also liked to tease him. He boasted:
    "Everyone else sits and answers questions, but I walk back and forth in the classroom, watching how they answer questions."
    "But don't you answer questions?"
    "I already answered them."
    "But how can the female teacher allow you to walk back and forth in the classroom?"
    "Because she likes me," he replied.
    How is it that his son isn't in his heart, how did this happen?
    Not long ago, the doctor noticed the excessive pampering and indulgence surrounding Igor at home, which made him angry.
    Sonia comes home from work and tutors Igor, tutoring him until three o'clock in the morning, because he is very lazy, but he has to hand in his paper the next day. It's outrageous.
    It's a strange thing: the child goes to school, he goes if he wants to. And often he doesn't want to go. He often doesn't come back from the skating rink or the cinema until midnight, and it's hard to get up early in the morning... and his mother—how hateful!—writes a note to the school saying that her son has a headache.
    What kind of person does she want to raise Igor into? A prince, or a rogue?
    He felt sorry for Lily. This child does well in her studies, is gentle, lively, and has a very good temper. But she doesn't get even half of the affection that Igor enjoys.
    Lily greets her father at the door, shouting so that the whole family can hear: "Dad is back!" and then recounts things reluctantly and softly. But Igor doesn't come out until dinner time, with a mournful face, dishevelled hair, and sits at the table improperly. If you scold him, he answers rudely...
    But Sonia always turns a deaf ear to those reproaches.
    He can't quarrel with Sonia. Sonia is Sonia after all. She is sacred and cannot be offended. Everything about Igor makes him angry. The way he sits! The way he answers his mother! How unfriendly, how cold, how arrogant...
    Once, in front of Igor, the doctor couldn't help it.
    Beef stew for lunch. Lily loves to eat bone marrow. Igor also loves to eat bone marrow. But somehow the bone is always given to Igor. This time, it was also given to him.
    "Could we make an exception and give the bone to Lily today?" the doctor said.
    Sonia pretended not to hear. Lily (lovely little girl!) said happily: "Oh, Dad! Let Igor eat it, I'm already grown up!" Igor raised his eyes from the plate, thoughtfully, with shameless (yes, shameless!) curiosity, looking at his father's face... Later, he nonchalantly dug the marrow out of the bone. The doctor sat there, his face red with anger and sadness...
    From that day on, Igor avoided him. He began to avoid his father. Yes, he probably drew some conclusion from this incident. This child is only fifteen years old in total... The doctor didn't look for him, didn't explain the matter. Heaven, my heaven. How rude, trivial, and confused. What a terrible misunderstanding...
    On the day he left, at the station—now the doctor remembered this—Igor stood far away at first, then suddenly stood closer, next to his father. When it was time to leave, Igor bowed to him, looking very closely at his face, and said coldly and firmly: "Goodbye, Dad," and then his eyes became new, very sharp... Was this a farewell? Was it asking for forgiveness? Was it wanting reconciliation? What was it?... At that time, he should have hugged Igor and said: "Little Igor, my child, everything that has happened between us—let's erase it forever, a blank page is unfolding before us, let's fill it together, you and I..."
    "Little Igor, everything in the past between us was false, but now—it's the real truth, let's face this truth together, you and I..."

    Chapter Four: Yuri

    "The nurse Smirnova forgot to put the needle plug (note) back in!" Yuri said to the head nurse Pena, pursing her thin lips meaningfully.
    Note: A needle plug (Madpen) is a very fine metal wire. When the injection needle is not in use, insert this fine wire into the needle hole to prevent rust inside the hole.

    第一部　夜
    第三章　比洛夫医生
    有一次，洗衣娘把自己的小女儿带来了，她比伊戈尔大三岁。她教他玩小石子及零和十字的游戏（注）。伊戈尔崇拜起她来了。他总是抱着她，吻她。梭妮嫉妒起来，问道：
    注：在地上划一方块，内划如棋盘之小方格，将格内填零和十字之游戏。
    “你顶爱谁？爱丽妲呢，还是爱我呢？”
    “当然是丽妲，”他回答道。
    可是后来玩具就不见了。梭妮不敢伤儿子的心，所以不作声。最后她忍不住了。
    “小伊戈尔，丽妲不是好孩子，”她说。“你那么爱她，可是她把你的好玩具都偷光了。”
    他什么话也没说，去到餐室里，拳着腿，坐到一张大沙发上，这样坐了好半天。梭妮说他当时的眼睛充满了惊奇与悲伤。
    后来，他从沙发上下来，走到妈妈跟前说：
    “别说是她偷去了吧。好不好？就说是我送给她的。让她还到这儿来吧。”
    丽妲又来了。
    等他们两个人一起留在那儿的时候，梭妮就听伊戈尔对她说：
    “如果你喜欢我的玩具，你就拿去吧。随便拿统统拿去都可以。我不要这些。”
    好孩子呵，好孩子……
    他六岁的时候，就偷了母亲的钱。
    他有美丽的黄白色的卷发。梭妮很宝贵这些，没有替他剪。他请求着剪掉，因为在院里都嘲笑他是小姑娘。可是梭妮却带着母性的虚荣与自私，回答说：
    “别管他们，他们什么都不明白的。这样再留一年，只留一年！”
    于是他就从院里溜走了，回来的时候，剪成了光头，扑脸一股香水气。
    “你在那里剪的呢？！”梭妮问着，眼睛瞪着他那突然变得粗野的难看的脸。
    她简直要哭了。
    “在理发店剪的，”他回答着。“我给他们了三个卢布，他们就用香水把我统统浇了浇。”
    “你从那拿的三个卢布？”
    “从你的钱包里偷的，”他回答着。
    “你为什么要偷呢？”她惊骇的问道。“你应该问我要一声，我就会给你的。”
    他摇摇头。
    “不对的，你不给的。”
    于是她不再责备他了，她抚摩着他那圆圆的，天鹅绒似的男孩子的头，哭着那剪去的卷发，就吻着他，吻着他，无限的疯狂的母爱呵………
    学校里有一个年轻的女教员，也是爱逗他玩。他夸口说：
    “大家全都坐着解答着问题，可是我却在教室来回走着，看他们怎么样解答问题。”
    “可是你不解答问题吗？”
    “我早就解答了。”
    “可是女教员怎么能许你在教室里来回走呢？”
    “因为她喜欢我，”他回答着。
    儿子怎么不在他心里呢，这事是怎样发生的呢？
    在不久以前，医生注意到家里围绕着伊戈尔的这过分的娇纵与溺爱，使他生气起来了。
    梭妮下班回来，替伊戈尔补功课，一直补到夜里三点钟，因为他懒得很，可是第二天又要交卷。真不成话。
    真是怪事：孩子上学，想去就去。而常常是不想去。他常常半夜才从滑冰场或电影院回来，早上很难起得早……而他的妈妈——多么可恶呵！——就给学校写一个条子说儿子头痛了。
    她要把伊戈尔养成什么人呢？养成王孙公子呢，还是养成一个流氓无赖呢？
    他很替莉莉抱不平。这孩子功课学得很好，温存，活泼，脾气非常好。可是她把伊戈尔所享的宠爱，连一半也得不到。
    莉莉在门口迎见父亲，就喊得全家都能听见：“爸爸回来了！”于是就恋恋不舍的呢呢喃喃的叙起来。可是伊戈尔却一直到吃饭的时候才出来，哭丧着脸，蓬着发，不端不正的往桌子跟前一坐，你要责备他一声，他就粗野的回答着……
    可是梭妮对那些责备老是当耳边风。
    他不能跟梭妮吵嘴的。梭妮到底是梭妮。她是神圣，不能得罪的。伊戈尔的一切都使他生气。他怎么坐呢！他怎么回答母亲呢！他多么不和气，多么冷酷，多么傲慢……
    有一次，当着伊戈尔的面，医生忍不住了。
    午饭炖牛肉。莉莉爱吃骨髓。伊戈尔也爱吃骨髓。可是不知怎的总是把骨头给伊戈尔。这回也给他了。
    “能不能今天破例把骨头给莉莉吃呢？”医生说。
    梭妮装着没听见。莉莉（可爱的小姑娘呵！）高兴的说：“呵，那的话，爸爸！让伊戈尔吃吧，我已经大了！”伊戈尔把目光从盘子上抬起来，沈思的，带着无耻的（是的，无耻的呵！）好奇心，看着父亲的脸……后来他毫不在乎从骨头里把骨髓往出掏着。医生满脸通红的，伤心的坐着……
    从那天起，伊戈尔对他回避起来了。他开始回避起父亲了，是的，大概他从这件事里得到什么结论了。这孩子总共才只有十五岁呵……医生也没有找他，没有说明这件事。天呵，我的天呵。多么粗鲁，琐碎，糊涂呵。多可怕的误会呵……
    在他出门的那天，在车站上——现在医生想起这件事了——伊戈尔起先站得远远的，突然站到跟前，站到父亲旁边。当离别的时候，伊戈尔向他弯着腰，很近的望着他脸，冷淡而坚决的说：“再见吧，爸爸，”于是他的眼睛成了新的，非常锐敏的了……这是告别吗？是求恕吗？是要和解吗？这是什么呢？……那时他应当抱着伊戈尔说：“小伊戈尔，我的孩子，咱们中间所发生的一切，——永远都一笔勾消吧，在咱们面前展开了一页白纸，咱们一块儿去填它吧，你和我…”
    “小伊戈尔，咱们中间已往的一切，全是虚伪的，而现在呢，——是真正的真理，咱们俩在这真理面前，你和我……”
    第四章　尤丽
    “女护士斯密诺瓦忘了把针塞（注）插起来呢！”尤丽对看护长裴娜说着，意味深长的把薄嘴唇抿了一抿。
    注：针塞（Ｍａｄｐｅｎ）为一极细之金属丝，注射针不用时，将此细丝插入针孔内，以免孔内生锈。
