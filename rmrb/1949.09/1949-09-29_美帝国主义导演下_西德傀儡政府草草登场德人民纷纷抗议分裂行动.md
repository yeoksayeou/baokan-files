Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 27th -- The puppet show of the so-called West German state, directed by the United States in West Germany, has been hastily completed in Bonn. After Konrad Adenauer, chairman of the Christian Democratic Union, was appointed to form a cabinet by the so-called West German President Heuss, he was approved by the Federal Assembly on the 15th with a bare majority and formally formed a cabinet on the 20th. The puppet cabinet is headed by Adenauer as Prime Minister, Erich Mende of the Free Democratic Party as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of the so-called European Recovery Program, and includes four members of the Christian Democratic Union, four members of the Christian Social Union, two members of the Free Democratic Party, and two members of the far-right fascist German Party. The Social Democratic Party led by Kurt Schumacher, which is supported by the British occupation authorities, was arranged outside this "government" as a so-called "opposition party" because it fell out of favor with its American masters, to help implement the deception against the German people. With the appearance of the Adenauer government, the military governments of the United States, Britain, and France announced their end on the 20th, replaced by the so-called High Commission of the three countries in Germany, which announced that the notorious German Occupation Statute would take effect on the 21st. On the day of his inauguration, Adenauer clamored in the "Federal Parliament" to make Germany join the "European Union" as soon as possible and did not recognize the existing German-Polish border, thus paving the way for the American plan to incorporate West Germany into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
    The German people have protested against the open division of Germany by the imperialist group headed by the United States and the use of West Germany as a new anti-Soviet line of defense. Many factories and mines in the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany held meetings, and the workers unanimously demanded the abolition of the separatist Bonn state and the establishment of a unified, democratic, and independent Germany. A resolution passed by educators in Halle and the Saale district stated that one day the German people would resolutely settle accounts with the Bonn traitors.

　　美帝国主义导演下
  　西德傀儡政府草草登场德人民纷纷抗议分裂行动
    【新华社北京二十七日电】美国导演下在德国西部成立所谓西德国家的傀儡戏，已在波恩草草完成。基督教民主党主席阿登纳经所谓西德总统休斯任命组阁后，于十五日经联邦会议以一票过半数批准，并于二十日正式组成内阁。傀儡内阁由阿登纳自任总理，自由党布鲁澈任副总理兼所谓欧洲复兴计划部长，其他有基督教民主党阁员四人，基督教社会党阁员四人，自由党二人与极右翼法西斯德意志党阁员二人。为英国占领区当局所支持的舒马赫社会民主党因失宠于美国主子被按排在这个“政府”外充当所谓“反对党”，帮助实施对德国人民的骗局。随着阿登纳政府的袍笏登场，美英法三国军政府二十日宣告结束，而代之以三国所谓驻德高级委员会，后者并宣布臭名远扬的德国占领法规于二十一日起生效。阿登纳在登台的当天在“联邦议会”狂叫要使德国尽速加入“欧洲联盟”，不承认现存的德波边界，这样来替美国想把西德纳入北大西洋公约圈的打算准备道路。
    德国人民对以美国为首的帝国主义集团公开分裂德国、使西德充当新的反苏交通隔断线的行为，纷纷表示抗议。德国苏占区许多工厂、矿场都举行了大会，工人们一致要求废除分立的波恩国家，成立统一、民主和独立的德国。哈勒城和沙勒区教育工作者通过的决议说，总有一天，德国人民会坚决地清算波恩卖国贼的罪行。
