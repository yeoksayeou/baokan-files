Xinhua News Agency, Northwest Front, 17th: Ma Zhenwu, commander of the 190th Division of the Qinghai Ma Bufang bandit troops, Zhao Sui, deputy commander of the 62nd Army, Tan Chengxiang, commander of the 100th Division, and other officers and soldiers who surrendered to the People's Liberation Army in early September, jointly sent a telegram yesterday to Ma Yunzhang, the pseudo-mayor of Dihua City in Xinjiang, and all officers and soldiers of the Qinghai Ma Bufang bandit troops' Fifth Cavalry Army currently in Xinjiang. The telegram informed them of the policies and propositions of the People's Liberation Army and urged them to recognize the general trend, resolutely rise in revolt, and join the people. The original telegram stated: The people of all circles in Qinghai have suffered cruel oppression and exploitation by the Kuomintang government and Ma Bufang in the past and are in a dire situation. Now the People's Liberation Army has come to liberate the people, implement ethnic equality, freedom of religious belief, and strict discipline, without violating the people's interests in the slightest. People from all walks of life are welcoming them warmly with food and drink. Zhenwu and others led their broken troops, with no way to turn, at a critical juncture of life and death filled with hesitation and fear. Fortunately, Mr. Ma Zhenqing, Mr. Ma Quanqin, and Mr. Ma Shilie came forward and learned about the lenient policy of the People's Liberation Army and that their families were being protected by the People's Liberation Army. Therefore, they led their troops to accept the advice, surrender their weapons, and have now safely returned to Xining. Their personalities are respected, and their relatives have been reunited, embarking on a new path. Now that the People's Liberation Army is about to liberate all of China, we hope that the officers and soldiers in Xinjiang will consider the overall situation, resolutely rise up in revolt, and join the people, avoiding unnecessary sacrifices.
