　　Attending meetings under Kuomintang rule, aside from the reactionary factions hosting "effective" meetings that "ordered" you to participate, freely holding meetings was very difficult. Therefore, I was always a bit afraid of "speaking." Now that we are liberated, having the opportunity to practice attending meetings and practice speaking is a very delightful thing. However, in my practice, I always find it difficult to shake off various lurking incorrect ideologies.

　　Initially, I often remained silent, afraid that saying "supporting" words would make people call me an "opportunist," and worried that saying "opposing" words would lead to "reactionary thought" criticism. Saying theoretical things I didn't understand, and saying practical things felt too simple and not profound enough. Once others finished expressing their opinions, I would hear them and think, "That's all it is," even not as good as what I wanted to say! But why didn't I speak? Hesitation! But what was there to hesitate about?

　　Gradually, I started speaking, although not "Today's weather... haha," but still with a bit of "socializing" flavor. Although I hadn't read much, I used Marxist-Leninist terminology freely and always rushed to speak first, afraid that others would say it first, and I would have nothing to say.

　　Later, although I didn't rush to speak before others, I always wanted to say something "new," to stand out and gain some face. So, I forcefully pieced together a certain passage of material I had read, wanting to show that I knew more than others, often being self-righteous and negating everything!

　　When I felt my speeches were empty, I started working hard in private. For the topic to be discussed, I searched for reference books, extracting or "clipping" all relevant material, preparing to have "evidence" when speaking. Thus, I argued forcefully, reading for the sake of "speaking," speaking for the sake of "face," which occupied a long period of my learning time!

　　After listening to lectures and reports, reading books and magazines, receiving guidance from teachers and friends, and engaging in discussions with classmates, especially after reading Chairman Mao's saying, "No investigation, no right to speak!" I realized the difficulty of speaking. Not only must one read widely and deeply understand Marxist-Leninist theory, but also humbly learn Mao Zedong Thought. Only then did I gradually eliminate the "face," "pretense," and other foul things. I no longer thought of "speaking" as giving a report, but spoke with a spirit of seeking truth from facts and humbly seeking truth. "Speaking" is to express one's own views, and more importantly, to frankly reveal one's confused concepts. If one doesn't speak out about unclear areas to seek correction, how can one "progress"?

　　Therefore, speaking is not an easy thing, nor is it a difficult thing, as long as you maintain an honest attitude towards learning, a spirit of humbly seeking progress, and engage in mutual discussion with everyone, without hesitation or fear; sweep away the problems of showing off, saving face... then speaking will become a very natural thing.

　　不老实的学习态度
    睢竹
    开会，在国民党统治下，除去反动派主持的有“作用”的会“命令”你参加外，自由开会是很不易的，因此，我对“发言”总有些害怕！现在解放了，有机会练习开会，练习发言，这是件很痛快的事，不过，我在练习中，总不易摆脱潜伏的各种不正确的意识。
    最初，常常一言不发，说“拥护”的话怕人说“投机”，说“反对”的话又担心加以“反动思想”的批评，说理论的不懂，说实际的又嫌太简单不够深刻，等到别人发表完了意见，自己一听，“不过如此”，还不如我想说的呢！可是，我怎么不说呢？顾虑！其实有什么顾虑的？
    慢慢的说话了，虽然不是“今天天气……哈哈”，而也带点“应酬”味道，虽然没读过什么书，可是满口马列主义的名词，并且总要抢在前面说，怕人家说过了，自己就没说的。
    再往后，虽不抢在别人前面说，可是总想说些“新鲜的”，要出人头地，挣点面子，所以把自己看过的某一段材料，强拉硬扯地凑合起来，要显出自己，比别人知道的多，常常自以为是，抹煞一切！
    当感到发言空虚时，于是私下用起功来，对于要讨论的题目，寻找参考书，把所有有关的材料摘录下来或“剪报”，预备在发言时“有根据”。于是，强词夺理，为“发言”而读书，为“面子”而发言，占了我很长的一个学习时间！
    我听了讲演报告，看了书报杂志，师友的指教，同学的讨论，尤其是读了毛主席所说的“没有调查研究，就没有发言权！”后，知道了发言的不易，不但要广泛的读书，深刻的认识马列理论，虚心地学习毛泽东思想，这才逐渐取消了“面子”，“架子”等臭东西。不自以为“发言”就是报告，而以实事求是，虚心求真理的精神来发言。“发言”是为表示自己的见解，同时，更重要的是坦白出来自己的糊涂观念，模糊的地方不说出来求改正，那怎么能“进步”呢？
    所以发言不是件容易事，也不是件难事，只要你抱着老实的学习态度，虚心求进步的精神和大家互相研讨，不要顾虑，不要害怕；把风头，面子……的毛病一扫光，那末发言就成为很自然的事了。
