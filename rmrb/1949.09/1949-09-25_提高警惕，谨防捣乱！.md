　　Raise Vigilance, Beware of Sabotage!
    The United States Senate passed Truman's "Military Aid to Foreign Countries Act" on the 22nd to arm reactionary forces in Europe and Asia. This bill stipulates that out of the total of $1,314,000,001, $75 million will be earmarked for "aiding anti-communist activities in China and general areas." Here, the reactionary ruling clique in the United States will continue to be enemies of the Chinese people, continue their failed adventures in China, and strengthen the aggressive face of their unspeakable fifth column sabotage plot, which is once again nakedly exposed.
    The Kuomintang reactionaries, armed by American imperialists with $5.9 billion, have been defeated by the Chinese people. This mere $75 million appropriation will naturally not save the fate of the Chinese reactionaries. However, we should firmly remember what Chairman Mao Zedong warned us: "The imperialists and their running dogs, the Chinese reactionaries, will not be reconciled to their defeat. They will still collude with each other and use all possible means to oppose the Chinese people. For example, they will send their running dogs into China to carry out divisive and disruptive work." The US imperialists are using this $75 million to help the Chinese reactionaries carry out their deathbed struggle and to buy off the fifth column to carry out sabotage, disruption, and all kinds of despicable and shameless activities within China. When explaining the use of this dirty fund, Senator Connally, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said: "The president can expend any funds from the $75 million at his discretion. He can give this money to anyone and any group for use without specifying the nature of the use." This vile and despicable activity against the Chinese people is so scandalous that even the always shameless American imperialists have to declare in advance that the funds spent for this activity "need not specify the nature of the use."
    All the Chinese people, all patriotic elements in the country, should, in the face of this new concrete action by American imperialism, increase their vigilance a thousandfold, and beat to a bloody pulp any pig that dares to stick its nose into the beautiful vegetable garden of the People's Republic of China.

### 提高警惕，谨防捣乱！

　　提高警惕，谨防捣乱！
    美国参议院于二十二日通过杜鲁门武装欧亚反动势力的“军事援外法案”。这个法案规定在十三亿一千四百另一万美元的总数中，指拨七千五百万美元，作为“援助中国及一般地区反共之用”。在这里，美国反动统治集团将继续与中国人民为敌，继续他们在中国失败的冒险，并加强其不可告人的第五纵队的破坏阴谋的侵略面目，再一次赤裸裸地暴露出来了。
    美帝国主义者用五十九亿美元武装起来的国民党反动派已经被中国人民打垮了，这次区区七千五百万元的拨款，自然决不能挽回中国反动派的覆亡的命运。可是，我们应该牢牢记住毛主席所告诫我们的：“帝国主义者及其走狗中国反动派对于他们的失败是不会甘心的。他们还会要互相勾结在一起、用各种可能的方法、反对中国人民。例如派遣他们的走狗钻进中国内部来进行分化工作和捣乱工作。”美帝国主义化这七千五百万元，就是用来援助中国反动派进行垂死挣扎，和收买第五纵队来在中国内部进行破坏、捣乱和各种卑鄙无耻的活动的。参院外委会主席康纳利在说明这笔肮脏款项的用途时说：“总统可以从七千五百万元中权宜支出任何基金，他可以把此款交给任何人和任何团体使用，而不必列明用途的性质。”这种反对中国人民的下流而卑鄙的活动，是那样见不得人，以致连一向寡廉鲜耻的美帝国主义者，也不得不事先声明为这种活动而支出的经费，“不必列明用途的性质”了。
    全中国人民，全国一切爱国分子都应该在美帝国主义这一新的具体行动面前，千倍百倍地提高自己的警惕性，对于任何胆敢把鼻嘴伸进中华人民共和国这个美丽的菜园子里来的猪，打它个头破血流。　　【新华社北平二十四日电】
