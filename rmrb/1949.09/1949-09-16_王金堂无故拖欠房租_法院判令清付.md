Wang Jintang Unjustifiably Defaults on Rent
　Court Orders Payment
　[This City News] The People's Court of this city recently adjudicated a rent dispute case. The defendant, Wang Jintang, rented two rooms from the plaintiff, Xie Yan's family, in January of this year for 50 jin of flour per month. In April of this year, he requested Xie Yan's family to change the rent to 50 jin of millet per month, and refused to pay rent from May onwards. Xie Yan's family requested the Sixth District Public Office to mediate, but failed to reach an agreement, and was referred by the District Public Office to the People's Court for handling. The defendant's agent (his son, Wang Wenhua) used the excuse of reduced income and inability to afford it, disagreeing with the initially proposed rent price of 50 jin of millet that he himself had put forward. The court held that inability to pay could not be a reason for refusing to pay rent, and that the price of 50 jin of unhusked millet requested by the plaintiff was not considered high for the two north-facing rooms rented by the defendant. Furthermore, after investigation by the court, the defendant's claim of reduced income was not factual. Based on the above reasons, the court ruled that, starting from July of this year, the defendant should pay the plaintiff 50 jin of unhusked millet per month, and the owed rent should also be calculated at 50 jin of millet per month, to be paid to the plaintiff within ten days after the judgment.

　　王金堂无故拖欠房租
　  法院判令清付
    【本市讯】本市人民法院顷判决一件房租纠纷案。被告王金堂于今年一月以每月面粉五十斤租住原告谢阎氏房两间。本年四月，请求谢阎氏改收房租为每月小米五十斤，五月起拒绝交租。谢阎氏请求第六区公所调解，未能协议，由区公所介绍到人民法院处理。被告代理人（其子王文华）借口收入减少，无力负担，不同意最初由他自己提出的租价小米五十斤。法院认为无力负担并不能成为拒不给租的理由，且原告所请求的伏地小米五十斤的价格，对被告所租的二间北房说来，租额并不算高，且经法院调查，被告所称收入减少并非事实。根据上述理由，法院判决：自本年七月份起，被告每月付给原告伏地小米五十斤，所欠房租亦按每月小米五十斤计算，于判决后十日内清付原告。
