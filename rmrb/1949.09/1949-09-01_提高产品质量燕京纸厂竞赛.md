　　Yan Jing Paper Mill Competition to Improve Product Quality
    [This City News] In order to implement the resolution of the Beiping All-Circles Representative Conference on improving the quality of industrial products, Yan Jing Paper Mill plans to launch a two-month production competition, relying on the strength of workers, to improve product quality, as the focus of the September and October production plans.
    In the past few months, a considerable number of substandard paper products have been produced by the factory. In July, a quarter of the 35-pound paper produced was substandard (i.e., the weight was outside the range of 33 to 37 pounds). In August, due to slightly inferior materials, even more finished products were substandard. From August 1st to 20th, only slightly more than one-fifth of the finished products met the 35-pound standard, 47.6% were between 33 and 36 pounds, and 31.5% were substandard. In addition, the amount of damaged paper (i.e., damaged during paper making and finishing) was also very high. Before August, there were no statistics at all. Since August 1st, there have only been inaccurate daily reports. It is estimated that the average amount of damaged paper is about one-fifth of the amount of paper made. Therefore, the cost of the factory's products is seriously affected. Therefore, in this production plan, it is stipulated that the standard be raised to a tolerance of one pound above or below, and that the amount of damaged paper be reduced to 5%.
    In terms of work efficiency, preparations are being made to improve further. Previously, the finishing department did not have a daily work report system, and work efficiency was difficult to check. Records have only been kept since August 26th. On average, it takes 23 minutes to sort one ream of paper, and now the standard is set at 20 minutes. Previously, a papermaking blanket broke once, delaying the production of more than 100 reams of paper. During the discussion of this production plan, a workers' group proposed to guarantee that blankets would be prepared in advance and replaced immediately when they broke, to minimize downtime. At the same time, the paper-cutting rotary knife was modified. Originally, it rotated 18 times per minute, but now it can be increased to 22 times per minute, saving both time and electricity.
    In addition, in terms of raw material consumption, the factory plans to use low-priced materials to replace high-priced materials. Previously, the factory used American bleach, but it was too old and its effectiveness was inaccurate, so it was replaced with bleaching powder essence. However, bleaching powder essence is very expensive. Since mid-August, the bleaching powder produced by Tianjin Chemical Company has been tried, and its effectiveness is very good. The cost can be reduced by about 500 to 600 yuan per ream of paper. During the discussion of this production plan, workers also proposed washing and reusing the bleach residue from the first use, which could save about 10% more. At the same time, the factory accepted the suggestion of the Enterprise Bureau Research Office to use castor oil instead of foreign machine oil on the coarse machines, which can save about 100,000 yuan per month. The factory also plans to establish a research office in September to study the use of raw materials and medicines, and to establish various work systems.
    Previously, for a period of time, the factory only emphasized quantity and not quality, resulting in a large number of substandard finished products that could not be sold. Now the factory has begun to correct this deviation, and all employees are paying attention to improving quality and streamlining and saving to fulfill the call of the All-Circles Representative Conference.

### 提高产品质量燕京纸厂竞赛

　　提高产品质量燕京纸厂竞赛
    【本市讯】燕京造纸厂为了执行北平各界代表会议关于提高工业产品质量的决议，计划发起两个月的生产竞赛，依靠工人的力量，以提高产品质量，作为九、十两月生产计划的重心。
    在过去几个月里，该厂出产的纸张不合标准的相当多。七月份所出三十五磅的纸，竟有四分之一不合标准（即重量在三三至三七磅以外）。八月份因为料子差一点，不合标准的成品就更多了。从八月一日到二十日，成品里合乎三十五磅的，只有五分之一强，在三三至三六磅之间的，占百分之四七·六，不合标准的占百分之三一·五。此外，损纸（即在抄纸时和完成时损坏了的）的数量也很多。八月份以前，根本无统计，自八月一日起，才有了不精确的日报。据估计，损纸平均量约为抄纸量五分之一。因此，严重地影响到该厂产品的成本。所以在这次的生产计划里，规定把标准提高到上下不差一磅，把损纸量减到百分之五。
    在工作效率方面，准备再提高一步。以前完成部没有工作日报制，工作成效很难稽查。从八月二十六日起，才开始有记录，平均二十三分钟可整理一令纸，现在准备以二十分钟作标准。以前，有一次抄纸的毛布坏了，耽误了一百多令纸。这次讨论生产计划时，一个工人小组提出保证，预先准备好毛布，坏了马上换，尽量少停车。同时改造了裁纸转刀，原来每分钟十八转，现在每分钟可增到二十二转，省时又省电。
    此外，在原料消费方面，该厂准备用低价物品代替高价物品。以前该厂用美国漂白粉，因为太陈旧，效力不准确，所以改用了漂粉精。但是漂粉精非常贵。自八月中旬起，试用天津化学公司出的漂白粉，效力很好。每令纸约可减低成本五、六百元。这次讨论生产计划时，工人并提出把第一次用过的漂粉渣子，洗一下再用，这样又可节省百分之十左右。同时该厂接受企业局研究室的建议，将在粗机器上使蓖麻油代替洋货机器油，每月约可节省十万元。该厂并计划在九月里成立研究室，研究原料和药品的使用，并建立各种工作制度。
    以前，有一时期，该厂只重量，不重质，致有大批不合规格的成品，无法销售。现在该厂已开始纠正这个偏向，全体职工都注意到以提高质地、精简节约来完成各界代表会议的号召。
