　　Municipal Factories and Mines Joint Conference
  　Enterprise Bureau Deploys Work
    Carry out mass-based streamlining and economy, strengthen leadership in management democratization, and actively expand sales channels.
    [Report from this newspaper] The Municipal People's Government Enterprise Bureau convened a joint meeting of responsible persons from its affiliated factories and mines yesterday (9th). Based on the spirit of the resolutions of the Municipal People's Representatives Conference, the meeting summarized the work of July and August and deployed the work for the coming September and October. During the meeting, representatives from factories that had done well in streamlining and economy and management democratization, such as the Tram Company and Qinghe Woolen Mill, reported on their work experience. Then, Deputy Director Jia gave a comprehensive report on the implementation of the resolutions of the People's Representatives Conference by various factories and mines, and deployed the work for September and October. The reports from various units and the comprehensive report from Deputy Director Jia indicated that the factories and mines under the Enterprise Bureau had achieved great results in streamlining and economy, improving quality, reducing costs, and democratic management. For example, the Tram Company, due to streamlining personnel, saving materials, and expanding business, has reduced its losses. If the "contracted ride" system can be implemented to reduce accidents, then income and expenditure can be balanced. The Water Company, by repairing leaking pipes and saving electricity, has reduced the cost of each ton of water by half a jin of millet, saving 110,000 jin of millet per month. The Qinghe Woolen Mill, as a result of streamlining and economy in the latter half of August, saved 30,490 jin of corn. The factory also paid attention to saving time. In the past, machines could only be started ten minutes after the whistle blew for work, and often stopped work early to pack up tools before the end of the shift. Now, all preparations are made before the whistle blows for work every day, and machines are started as soon as the whistle blows, and machines are not stopped until the designated time at the end of the shift. Therefore, in half a month, the savings from time alone amounted to 298,100 yuan. The Second Soy Sauce Factory has reduced the cost of raw materials by half per jin by improving raw materials. Mentougou Coal Mine has also saved 300,000 jin of millet per month by improving seven systems. In terms of improving quality, the newly built Glass Factory has achieved good results. The glass utensils produced by the factory can be heated to 280 degrees Celsius and thrown into cold water without cracking, so sales have increased greatly, and orders are coming from other places. Regarding the work of democratic management in factories, the Tram Company and Yanjing Paper Mill have done a better job.
    In his report, Deputy Director Jia pointed out that there are still some noteworthy problems in the areas of streamlining and economy, developing production, and democratic management:
    First, streamlining and economy cannot only be a slogan of leaders; it must become a mass movement to be done well. At the same time, clear goals and specific figures must be set in savings. For example, some factories currently only shout about saving without specific figures and goals, which is not good, because this way, no achievements can be seen. At the same time, having only figures cannot determine the quality of achievements; it is necessary to stipulate reasonable consumption in all aspects, such as a machine that reasonably consumes 80 degrees of electricity per day. In the past, it used to consume 90 degrees, and now it saves 5 degrees, only using 85 degrees. Although there is achievement in this way, it cannot be considered good.
    Second, streamlining and economy must not disregard product quality, creating another deviation. We want to save, and at the same time, the quality must be good.
    Third, some systems must be established in streamlining and economy, such as the "contracted ride" system of the Tram Company, and the personal responsibility system and personal work standard system of other factories and mines. However, many systems cannot be established at once during implementation. It is necessary to grasp the central link and do it with emphasis, otherwise nothing will be done well.
    Fourth, implementing democratic enterprise management is the central key to ensuring production savings, improving quality, and reducing costs. However, democratic management is a long-term task, not a short-term movement that can succeed. The leading comrades in our factories and mines must promote democracy at all times and places and consult with the workers and masses. Streamlining and economy is a democratic work, and the sanitation and hygiene movement is also a democratic work. The democratic management movement must have specific content and must be carried out with leadership and step-by-step, and must not be allowed to flow freely.
    Fifth, at present, business units have a nearsighted tendency in their operations, which is mainly manifested in setting prices too high, being unwilling to make small profits but quick turnover, and being unwilling to spend on sales promotion and advertising, and not knowing how to develop business by opening up sales channels. For example, the pharmaceutical factory and the paper mill cannot sell their finished products because the prices are too high. Another example is the ice factory. At that time, Tianjin merchants came to buy ice, but they did not pay attention to exporting products, and still sold them at high prices. As a result, the merchants lost money and did not come to buy them again. Another example is the newly built Glass Factory. A month ago, the leaders suggested that the factory place an advertisement, but they said that the advertising fee would cost hundreds of thousands of yuan and they were unwilling. Finally, after repeated urging, they placed an advertisement. Sure enough, after a few days, Nanjing wrote to contact them. Therefore, Deputy Director Jia said, we still have to learn in this regard.
    In the afternoon, the meeting continued to discuss the current situation of various factories and mines and their work plans. Finally, Director Mou made a summary. Director Mou emphasized three points of work spirit: First, streamlining and economy cannot only be a matter for leading comrades; a mass movement must be launched. Second, future work must have a focus, centered on improving quality or streamlining and economy. everything can't be done at once. Third, the work of democratic management must be carried out with leadership, planning, and step-by-step. Inaccurate opinions of workers must be persuaded and educated. Finally, the work plan was revised based on the specific situations raised by each unit. He encouraged the responsible comrades of each business unit to expand their business as much as possible and serve the two million citizens of Beiping. Pingxi Coal Mine Company should try to overcome difficulties to supply Beiping citizens with coal for the winter, and the public transportation bus company should not only restore business in the city, but also expand to the suburbs, and even to Tong County. The meeting adjourned at six o'clock. (Jia Chi)

　　市属各厂矿联席会议
  　企业局布置工作
    开展群众性精简节约，加强管理民主化的领导，积极开拓销路。
    【本报讯】本市人民政府企业局昨（九）日召开所属各厂矿负责人联席会议，根据本市各界代表会议决议的精神总结七、八两月工作，并布置今后九、十两月工作。会议中首先由精简节约，管理民主化工作进行较好的各厂，如电车公司、清河制呢厂等单位报告工作经验，然后由贾副局长综合报告各工厂矿山执行各界代表会决议执行情况，并布置九、十两月工作。各单位的汇报与贾副局长的综合报告说明，企业局所属各厂矿在精简节约、提高质量、减低成本、民主管理等方面均已获得很大成绩。如电车公司，由于精简人事，节约材料，扩展业务，赔累已减少，如能实行包乘制，减少事故，则收支就可平衡。自来水公司由于检修漏水管、节省电力等，已将每吨水的成本减低半斤小米，每月可节省十一万斤小米。清河制呢厂八月下半月精简节约的结果，已节省了玉米三万零四百九十斤。该厂并注意到节约时间，以往上班在拉笛以后十分钟机器才能开动，在下班时则往往提前停工收拾工具。现在每天拉笛上班以前即全部作好准备工作，一拉笛就开机器，下班则非到钟点不停机器。因此在半月中单从时间上节约的结果，就省下了二十九万八千一百元。第二酱油厂过去从改进原料上节省，使每斤原料目前的成本减低一半。门头沟煤矿也因改进了七种制度，每月已节省三十万斤小米。在提高质量方面，新建玻璃厂有成绩，该厂出产玻璃器具可热至摄氏二百八十度投入冷水不裂，因此销路大增，外地都来定货。关于工厂管理民主化工作，电车公司、燕京造纸厂做得较好。
    贾副局长在报告中指出，目前在精简节约，发展生产，民主管理各方面尚存在着一些值得注意的问题：
    一、精简节约不能光是领导者的口号，它必须成为一个群众性的运动才能做得好。同时在节省中必须定出明确的目标与具体的数字。如目前有些工厂只喊节约，没有具体数字与目标是不好的，因为这样就看不出成绩。同时光有数字也还不能决定成绩的好坏，还得规定各方面的合理消耗，如一架机器每天合理的消耗要用八十度电，过去要用九十度，现在节省了五度，只用八十五度。这样成绩虽有，但不能算好。
    二、精简节约不能不顾产品质量，造成另一个偏向。我们要节约，同时质量要好。
    三、在精简节约中必须建立一些制度，如电车公司的包乘制，其他各厂矿的个人负责制，个人工作标准制。但实行时不能一下建立许多制度，必需抓住中心环节，有重点地去做，否则会都搞不好。
    四、贯彻企业管理民主化，是保证生产节约，提高质量，减低成本的中心关键。但管理民主化是一个长期的工作，不是一个短期运动可以成功的。我们厂矿中的领导同志必须随时随地发扬民主，与职工群众商量办事。精简节约是一个民主化工作，清洁卫生运动也是一个民主化工作。管理民主化运动必须有具体的内容，必须有领导的有步骤的去做，不能让它自流。
    五、目前各企业单位的经营上有近视眼的倾向，其主要的表现在于订价过高，不肯薄利多销，不愿化推销费广告费，不知道从打开销路上去发展业务。如制药厂与造纸厂因订价太高，成品销不出去。再如制冰厂，当时有天津商人来买冰，可是他们对产品外销并不注重，依然以高价出售，结果商人赔本，不来买了。再如新建玻璃厂一个月前领导上就建议该厂登广告，可是他们说广告费要化几十万块钱，不愿意，最后再三催促才登了广告。果然过了几天南京都写信来联系了。因此贾副局长说，这方面我们还得学习。
    下午会议继续讨论各工矿现状，及工作计划。最后由牟局长作总结，牟局长强调指出三点工作精神：一、精简节约不能仅仅是领导同志的事，必须展开群众运动。二、今后工作要有重点，以提高质量为中心，或以精简节约为中心，不能什么都做。三、管理民主化工作必须有领导有计划有步骤，对工人的不准确意见要加以说服教育。最后并根据各单位所提具体情况修改了工作计划。勉励各企业单位负责同志要尽量扩展业务，为北平二百万市民服务。平西煤矿公司要尽量克服困难供应北平市民冬季用煤，公共汽车公司不仅要在市内恢复业务，并且要扩展到郊外、甚至到通县。会议至六时始散。　　　　　　　　　（家炽）
