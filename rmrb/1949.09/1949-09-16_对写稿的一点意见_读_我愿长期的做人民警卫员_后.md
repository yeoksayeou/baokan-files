　　Some Opinions on Writing
  　After Reading "I am Willing to be a People's Guard for a Long Time"
    Xi Zhan
    I love reading "People's Garden" the most, because it speaks to my itches, hits my shortcomings, and makes my face burn, so I can accept what the newspaper says and overcome them.
    But in some manuscripts, I feel that the key to the transformation from bad to good, from old to new, is not discussed clearly and in detail enough. For example, in the article "I am Willing to be a People's Guard for a Long Time" on August 27, there is a passage that reads: "After a short month of study, I have gained a lot of knowledge. I know the path that the revolution should take in the future and the main experiences of the revolution, and I also understand the hypocrisy of the so-called middle road...which made me understand that at this stage, it is not to eliminate state power, but to strengthen the state machinery..." But what exactly is the path that the revolution should take in the future and the main experiences? Why is the so-called "middle road" hypocritical? The reader is not able to understand.
    There is also a passage: "My idea of wanting to go south and not wanting to be a policeman is also a concept of fame and status...always thinking that revolution is not like this, but something earth-shattering. Now I realize that this idea is completely wrong..." But why did you realize it was completely wrong? This specific key to the transformation of thought is not introduced to the reader. In the previous paragraph, I can only understand that "at this stage, it is not to eliminate state power, but to strengthen the state machinery." This is helpful to me, but I have not been able to get greater help through this article (maybe my understanding is limited). Because the author has transformed his thinking through such study, from not wanting to be a policeman to being willing to be a people's guard for a long time, but how did the document (People's Democratic Dictatorship) solve the author's old thinking (not wanting to be a policeman)? Why did the old thinking fail and produce new thinking (willing to be a people's guard for a long time)? Especially in the second paragraph, the above says how the previous thoughts were, but then suddenly says that now I realize it is completely wrong. In this way, what the reader understands about the key to the author's transformation is just a mystery. Then, the reader only knows that the author has transformed, but he is still anxiously outside the door. Doesn't this reduce the effect of the article? So I think we should pay special attention to this key when writing, so that people with the same thoughts can get the same transformation.
    The last few paragraphs of the article introduce the root of the wrong thinking, and the introduction is more detailed. Although there are not many words, it is quite profound, so the reader's understanding will be more profound. So I think it is better to write the key to the transformation in this way.

　　对写稿的一点意见
  　读“我愿长期的做人民警卫员”后
    希战
    我是最爱看“人民园地”的，因为它能说到我的痒处，命中我的缺点，使我的脸会发烧，我就能接受报上所说的去克服。
    但在有些稿件中，我感到总是由坏到好，由旧变新的转变关键谈的不够明确、详细，如：八月二十七日的“我愿长期的做人民的警卫员”一文中，有一段是这样写的：“经过短短一个月的学习，使我得到了很多的知识，我知道今后革命要走的道路与革命的主要经验，也更明白了所谓中间路线的虚伪……使我知道在现阶段不是消灭国家权力，而是要加强国家机器……”但到底今后革命应走的道路与主要的经验是什么呢？所谓“中间路线”为什么虚伪呢？未能使读者了解。
    还有一段“我想南下不愿当警察的思想，也是一种名誉地位观念……，总想着革命不是这样、而是轰轰烈烈的。现在才认识到这种想法是完全错误的。……”但为什么你会认识到完全不对呢？这种具体的思想转变关键是没有介绍给读者的。在前一段中，我只能了解到“在现阶段不是消灭国家权力，而是加强国家机器”。这是对我的帮助，但我未能通过这篇文章而得到更大的帮助（也许是我的领会程度有限）。因为作者通过了这样的学习转变了思想，由不愿当警察而愿长期的做人民的警卫员，但从文件（人民民主专政）上如何解决了作者旧有的思想（不愿当警察）呢？为什么旧的思想会战败而产生新的思想（愿长期当人民的警卫员）呢？尤其第二段，上面说出了从前的想法是如何如何，但下面忽一下子就说，现在认识到完全错误，这样，读者对作者转变关键所了解的只是一个谜，那么，读者只知道作者是转变啦，而自己确还在门外着急，这不是减轻了文章的效果吗？所以我认为我们写稿子应特别注意这种关键，使同有这种思想的人，得到同样的转变。
    在该文最后几段是介绍错误思想的根源，介绍得较细致，虽然话不多，但是相当深刻，那么读者所领会的也会较为深刻。所以我认为写转变的关键，以这样的写法为较好。
