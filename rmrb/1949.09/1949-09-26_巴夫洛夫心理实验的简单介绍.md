A Simple Introduction to Pavlov's Psychological Experiments
    He Baoyuan

    In commemorating the centenary of Pavlov's birth, the most fundamental part of his contribution to psychology should be introduced to the public in simple terms, so that more people can understand the starting point of his work in this area.

    "The Establishment of Conditioned Reflexes." In his research on digestion, Pavlov discovered that a hungry dog would secrete saliva when it saw food, even before it ate it. Salivation caused by food entering the mouth is a pure reflex, but the reaction caused by seeing food may be learned. Pavlov called this reaction a conditioned reflex, the visual stimulus of seeing food a conditioned stimulus for the salivary reflex, and the food an unconditioned stimulus. He discovered through experiments that the salivary reflex could establish conditioned associations with almost any stimulus, such as the sound of a metronome, light, warm or vibratory stimuli on the skin, hearing a piece of music, and seeing certain shapes. Pavlov adopted the salivary response because it could be measured. He surgically moved a salivary gland duct of the dog to open on the skin of the cheek, so that saliva flowed outside the mouth, and then used an absorber to collect it for measurement.

    After the dog's surgical wound healed, the experimenter first established a close relationship with it and then familiarized it with the laboratory environment. During the experiment, it was made to stand on a specially made table, with its fore and hind limbs tied with slings to prevent it from walking away. The saliva collection tube was attached to the opening of the salivary gland on its cheek. The experimenter hid in an adjacent room to operate the instruments and provide conditioned stimuli and food.

    To establish a conditioned association between salivation and the metronome, the experimenter first made the metronome sound for a few seconds and then gave the dog food. After a few minutes of rest, the process was repeated. The length of each rest period varied to prevent the dog from developing a conditioned response to the rest itself. Gradually, the time the metronome sounded before giving food was extended to ten, fifteen, twenty, or thirty seconds. The shorter this time, the faster the conditioned response was established. However, at least some time had to be allowed for the conditioned response to manifest itself. Usually, after no more than five repetitions, a small amount of saliva would be secreted when the metronome sounded, before the food appeared. After ten or fifteen repetitions, salivation would increase, and the conditioned response would be well established, but a little review might be needed the next day when tested again.

    "Inhibition and Recovery of Conditioned Reflexes." If the established conditioned stimulus was repeated every two to five minutes, but without the unconditioned stimulus following, and the metronome was kept sounding for fifteen to thirty seconds each time without giving food, the initial saliva secretion would be plentiful when the metronome sounded, but continued experimentation would reduce the secretion, and after six to ten repetitions, it would stop completely. After a two-hour rest, the conditioned response might recover somewhat, but not completely. After a day of rest, it might automatically recover more. If food was given after the metronome sounded, or if the dog's appetite was stimulated with a little food a few minutes before the metronome was turned on, the conditioned response could recover more quickly.

    "Discrimination of Stimuli." When a salivary response has been conditioned to one stimulus, similar stimuli can also elicit the salivary response. If the original stimulus was a metronome sounding 120 beats per minute, then a metronome sounding 60 beats per minute could also elicit a response. If these two metronomes were used alternately, with food always following the 120-beat metronome and never the 60-beat metronome, the dog would gradually be able to distinguish between the two. After several repetitions, saliva would only be secreted after the 120-beat metronome sounded, and not after the 60-beat metronome. Thereafter, the experimenter could further refine the discrimination, gradually increasing the number of beats of the slower metronome until it reached 100 beats per minute, and the dog could still distinguish. Other stimuli, such as visual and tactile stimuli, could be experimented with in the same way. Such methods can be used to measure the limits of an animal's ability to discriminate between stimuli.

    "Delayed Conditioned Reflexes." Pavlov made the conditioned stimulus last for fifteen to thirty seconds before giving food or other unconditioned stimuli. Initially, the conditioned response appeared immediately when the conditioned stimulus began—when the metronome started sounding. But if food was always given thirty seconds after the metronome sounded, the saliva would be delayed until the food was about to appear. This entire response is twofold: first a negative response, followed by a positive response. In some dogs, the negative response was very clear: in the first fifteen seconds, its whole body relaxed, and it closed its eyes as if asleep; in the latter half of the stimulus delay, it became alert, showed preparatory movements, and secreted saliva.

    "Experimental Neurosis." Pavlov discovered that the salivary response could even be conditioned to painful stimuli, such as using a weak electric shock instead of a metronome. After continuous electric shocks for several seconds, food was given. When saliva secretion became a conditioned response to this electric shock, the intensity or frequency of the electric shock was gradually increased, and a salivary response could still be obtained. However, if the electric shock became too strong or too frequent, there was a sudden change—saliva was no longer secreted, food was no longer eaten, and there was violent resistance. Even reducing the electrical stimulation could not restore the original conditioned response. The dog became restless, agitated, and could not be experimented on for several months.

    Demanding too much discrimination can also produce experimental neurosis. In one experiment, the method of establishing discriminatory stimuli as mentioned above was first used to enable the dog to distinguish between a perfect circle and an ellipse with a length-to-width ratio of two to one. Then, in subsequent work, the ellipse was gradually changed to make it more and more like a perfect circle, and the ability to discriminate was initially maintained. But when the length and width of the ellipse became nine to eight, the dog not only could not distinguish between the two circles, but also its entire behavior in the laboratory changed drastically; it was no longer quiet and alert, it began to bark wildly, tried to escape, and bit the equipment. The next day, when it was brought back to the laboratory, it barked, and when it was put on the rack for experimentation, it could not even distinguish the original ellipse and circle. Pavlov said, "The conflict between excitation and inhibition strongly disrupts the balance of these two processes."

    Based on the above basic experiments, Pavlov conducted many valuable studies in this area and gave great inspiration to scientists in various fields around the world.

　　巴夫洛夫心理实验的简单介绍
    赫葆源
    纪念巴夫洛夫百年诞辰，应该把他对于心理学的贡献最基本的一部分用简单的说明介绍给大众，使更多人知道他在这方面工作的出发点。
    “交替反应的建立”。巴夫洛夫在作消化的研究中，发现一个饥饿的狗看到食物，但未吃到的时候，唾液就分泌了。唾液因食物入口而分泌是纯反射作用，但因看见食物而起反应则可能是学来的。巴夫洛夫把这种反应叫作交替反射，把视觉的刺激，见到食物叫作唾液反射的交替刺激，把食物叫作非交替的刺激。他由实验中发见唾液反应对任何刺激几乎都能建立交替作用。例如对于节拍器的响声，灯光，皮肤上受温热或振动的刺激，听到一段乐音和看到一些图形等。巴夫洛夫所以采用分泌的反应是因为它能衡量。用手术把狗的一条唾腺管移至颊面表皮上开口，使唾液流到嘴以外，再用吸收器收集之以备衡量。
    在狗的手术创口痊愈后，实验者先和它建立起亲密的关系，再使它熟习于实验室的环境。作实验时使它站在特制的桌上，用吊带系住它前后肢，使之不能走开。把收集唾液的管口贴在它颊面唾腺开口处。实验者躲入紧邻的另一室内去操纵仪器，给出交替的刺激和食物。
    欲使唾液分泌与节拍器发生交替作用，实验者先使节拍器响几秒钟，再给狗食物。休息几分钟再重作。每次休息时间长短不一定，以免狗对休息本身发生交替作用。渐渐把给食物前节拍器响的时间延长到十，十五，二十或三十秒，这时间越短，交替的建立越快。但至少须留一段时间，好让交替反应有机会表现出来。普通至多不过重复练习五次后，在节拍器响时，食物出现前就已有少量唾液分泌。练习十或十五次时唾液就增多了，交替反应也就建立好了，但次日再试验时也许先需要一点温习的工作。
    “交替反应的抑止和恢复”。如果每隔二至五分钟重复给出已成的交替刺激，但不再随以非交替的刺激；每次皆使节拍器继续响十五至三十秒，但不给食物。试验之初，节拍器响时唾液分泌很多，但继续如此试验，分泌就减少了，六至十次后便完全不分泌了。休息两小时，交替反应可能恢复一些，但非全部。休息一天，可能自动的恢复得多些。如节拍器响后再给以食物，或在节拍器开动前几分钟用一点食物刺戟这狗的食欲，交替反应就能恢复的比较快了。
    “分辨刺激”。当唾液反应已与一种刺激建立了交替作用时，类似的刺激也能引起这唾液反应。如果原用的刺激是每分钟一百二十响的节拍器，那么六十响的节拍器也能引起反应。假设把这两种节拍器轮流使用，而使食物永远随着一百二十响的，不随着六十响的节拍器，狗便渐能分辨这两种节拍了。若干次重复练习之后，唾液就永在一百二十响节拍之后分泌，而不在六十响的之后分泌了。此后实验者再把分辨的程度推进，就是渐渐增加响数少的节拍器的响数，直到增至每分钟一百响，狗也仍能分辨。他种刺激如视觉的和触觉的等等，也能用同样的方法来实验。这类方法可以用以衡量动物对刺激的分辨的限度。
    “延迟的交替反应”。巴夫洛夫使交替刺激持续十五至三十秒，再给食物或其他非交替的刺激。最初交替反应在交替刺激开始时——节拍器开始响时，立即出现。但如永在节拍器响了三十秒后才给食物，唾液也就延迟到最后食物即将出现时才分泌。这全部反应是双重的：先是负的，其后随以正的反应。有的狗负的反应表现得很清楚：在前十五秒中它全身松懈、闭眼好象入睡了，在刺激延迟中的后半时间内它才警醒，表现出预备的动作，并分泌唾液。
    “实验的神经病”。巴夫洛夫发现唾液反应甚至也能和痛楚的刺激建立起交替作用，例如用微弱的电击代替节拍器。在连续电击若干秒后，给以食物。俟唾液分泌成为这种电击的交替反应时，逐渐增加电击强度或次数，仍能有唾液反应。但是如果电击变得太强或太多时就有突然的变化了——唾液不再分泌，食物也不吃了，并且发生剧烈的反抗。即使再减弱电的刺激，也不能恢复原有的交替反应了。这狗就变成不安的、激动的，数月之内不能再作实验了。
    要求分辨太苛也能产生实验的神经病。在一实验中先用前面所说的建立分辨刺激的方法使狗能够分辨一个正圆和一个长比宽等于二比一的椭圆，此后在继续工作中渐渐把椭圆改变，使之越来越近似正圆，分辨能力起初仍能保持。但当椭圆的长和宽变成九比八时，狗不仅不能分辨这两个圆了，并且它的整个行为在实验室中也发生了急变；它不再是安静而警醒的了，它开始狂叫，想逃，咬仪器。次日再把它带入实验室，它就吠叫，再把它放上架实验时，他连最初的椭圆和正圆都不能分辨了。巴夫洛夫说：“激励和抑止的冲突强烈地破坏了原来这两种过程的平衡。”
    以上列各基实验为出发点，巴夫洛夫进行这方面的甚多有价值的研究，并且给了世界各方面的科学家极大的启示。
