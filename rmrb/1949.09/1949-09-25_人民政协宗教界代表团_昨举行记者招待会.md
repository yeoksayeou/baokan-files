　　People's Political Consultative Conference Religious Community Delegation
  　Holds Press Conference Yesterday
    Exposes U.S. Imperialist Reactionary Policies, Resolves to Eliminate Imperialist Influence.
    [This Newspaper] Beijing. The religious representatives attending the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference held a press conference yesterday (the 24th) at the Beijing Chinese Language School. More than 20 people attended, including representatives of the delegation and reporters from various newspapers in Beijing. At the meeting, the representatives first expressed their great honor to be able to participate in the People's Political Consultative Conference as religious believers and discuss national affairs together. Secondly, they expressed their great satisfaction with and firm support for the three draft documents passed by the Preparatory Committee of the People's Political Consultative Conference: "Organizational Law of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference," "Organizational Law of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China," and "Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference," and their determination to implement them. Wu Yaozong, the chief representative of the delegation, said: These three documents are suitable for the needs of the Chinese people. They can form a great unity among the Chinese people and generate a united force that China has never had before; realize true democracy, so that everyone can participate in national affairs under a unified goal, without religious discrimination. The representatives were particularly excited about the establishment of the People's Republic of China, the liberation of the Chinese people, and the liberation of religious believers from the oppression of imperialism. Buddhist representative Ju Zan said: There are still millions of Buddhist believers in Taiwan who are suffering from the oppression of U.S. imperialism and the remnant forces of the Kuomintang, so liberating Taiwan is also part of our responsibility. Liu Liangmo, who recently returned from the United States to attend this People's Political Consultative Conference, said indignantly: I am a Christian. I lived in the United States for nine years, and I personally saw the American reactionaries oppress Christians. Although the missionaries used by the ruling class preach high-sounding words, their actions are immoral. They oppress weak nations externally and enslave the broad masses of working people internally, and truly conscious Christians are also discriminated against by them. Christian Zhao Zichen said: In the past, our Christianity was often influenced by British and American imperialism ideologically and economically. From now on, we must separate ourselves from British and American imperialism cleanly and clearly. We must eliminate the influence of British and American imperialism within the church; at the same time, we must make it clear that we oppose the British and American reactionaries and the policies they implement, but we must unite more broadly with the broad masses of people in those countries. Finally, the representatives unanimously believed that in the future, it is necessary to unite and educate the broad masses of believers, so that everyone can catch up with the great revolutionary era, fully support the people's democratic dictatorship, and help build an independent and strong new China.

　　人民政协宗教界代表团
  　昨举行记者招待会
    揭露美帝反动政策，决肃清帝国主义影响。
    【本报讯】出席中国人民政治协商会议的宗教界代表，于昨日（二十四日）在北平华文学校举行记者招待会，到会有该团代表及在平各报记者共二十余人。会上各代表首先对他们这次能够以一个宗教信徒参加人民政治协商会议共襄国是表示十分荣幸。其次他们对人民政协筹备会通过的“中国人民政治协商会议组织法”、“中国人民共和国中央人民政府组织法”、“中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领”等三个草案表示非常满意并坚决拥护执行。该团首席代表吴耀宗说：这三个文件是适合中国人民所需要的，它可以使中国人形成一个伟大的团结，发生中国从未曾有过的团结力量；实现真正的民主，使每个人都能在统一的目标下参与国家大计，不受宗教信仰上的歧视。代表们尤其对中华人民共和国的成立，中国人民得到解放，宗教信徒也从帝国主义的压迫下解放出来感到十分兴奋。佛教代表巨赞先生说：现在在台湾还有千百万佛教信徒，受着美帝国主义和国民党残余势力的压迫，因而解放台湾也有我们一部分责任。新从美国归国出席这次人民政协会议的刘良模愤慨地说：我是基督教徒，我在美国住了九年，我亲眼看到美国反动派压迫基督教徒，虽然为统治阶级所利用的传教师宣传的是冠冕堂皇，但所作所为却是男盗女娼，对外压迫弱小民族，对内奴役广大劳动人民，而真正有觉悟的基督教徒也是受到他们的歧视的。基督教徒赵紫宸说：我们基督教过去常常从思想上经济上受英美帝国主义的影响，今后我们要和英美帝国主义干干净净明明白白分割开来，我们要在教内肃清英美帝国主义的影响；同时我们必须说明，我们反对的是英美反动派和他执行的政策，而对该国的广大人民是要更广泛的加以团结的。最后代表们一致认为：今后必须团结和教育广大教民，使大家赶上革命的大时代，完全拥护人民民主专政，帮助建立一个独立富强的新中国。
