Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 13th: TASS, Prague, 8th: The Czechoslovak government's Foreign Ministry has lodged a protest with the U.S. Embassy in Prague regarding the border incident provoked by U.S. occupation forces in Germany. The circumstances are as follows:

　　On August 27th, in the border village of Hşık Novı Domki, German-based U.S. occupation forces compelled a truck carrying a labor team of twenty-two Czechoslovak soldiers and a nine-year-old boy to drive into German territory; at the same time, two U.S. occupation personnel intruded into Czechoslovak territory. Upon learning of this on the 28th, the Czechoslovak Foreign Ministry immediately lodged a strong verbal protest with the U.S. Embassy in Prague. On the 31st, the U.S. Embassy responded with a note. The Czechoslovak Foreign Ministry replied to the U.S. note on September 6th, pointing out that on the day of the incident, on the road to Weiden (in the U.S. occupation zone of Germany), U.S. occupation personnel surrounded the Czechoslovak truck, ordered the Czechoslovak labor team to get out of the vehicle, searched them, and disarmed them. After arriving in Weiden, the labor team members were confined in a secret room in the local barracks, guarded by Americans carrying pistols and submachine guns. During the night, all the labor team members were subjected to rude interrogations and threatened with whipping. They were asked to reveal military secrets and were enticed to desert the Czechoslovak army; these requests were flatly rejected. During the interrogation, although the examination of maps confirmed that an American non-commissioned officer's assertion that the Czechoslovak truck had crossed the border by twenty-five yards was untrue, the interrogation did not cease. It was not until the next day that the nine-year-old Czechoslovak boy was handed over by an American officer to the Czechoslovak border authorities in Rozvadov. Three hours later, the Czechoslovak labor team members were escorted by armed U.S. officers and soldiers to Rozvadov, where they were handed over by German customs officials to the Czechoslovak border customs authorities.

　　The Czechoslovak Foreign Ministry's reply stated: The forcible abduction of the Czech labor team and the young child with them proves that Czechoslovak sovereignty has been subjected to a clearly premeditated and serious infringement. The Czechoslovak Foreign Ministry strongly protests against such actions and requests the U.S. Embassy to conduct a full investigation into this incident and to notify the Czechoslovak Foreign Ministry of the actions already taken against the perpetrators.

　　德境美军越界挑衅捷外交部坚决抗议
    【新华社北平十三日电】塔斯社布拉格八日讯：捷政府外交部已就德境美国占领军所挑起的边境事件向美国驻布拉格大使馆提出抗议，经过情形如下：
    八月二十七日，在边境上的捷希克·诺维·多姆基村，德境美占领军的武装兵士强迫载有二十二名捷克斯洛伐克军人所组成的劳动队队员和一个九岁男孩的卡车驶往德境；与此同时，两名美占领军人员侵入了捷克斯洛伐克领土。捷外交部于二十八日获悉后，立即向美国驻布拉格大使馆提出坚决的口头抗议。三十一日，美国大使馆以照会提出答复。捷外交部又于九月六日对美复文提出回答，指出在肇事的那天，在往魏敦（在德境美占区）的路上，美占领军人员包围捷卡车，命令捷克斯洛伐克劳动队从车上下来，施以搜查，并解除捷劳动队的武装。到达魏敦以后，劳动队员被关闭在当地兵营的密室中，由携有手枪和冲锋枪的美国人看守。在夜间劳动队员全体受到粗野的审问并受鞭打威胁。他们曾被要求说出军事秘密，并被劝诱脱离捷克斯洛伐克军队，这些要求被断然地拒绝了。在审讯期间，虽然由于检查地图确定了一个美国士官所说捷卡车越过边境二十五码的断言是不确实的，但审讯并未停止。直到第二天，九岁的捷国男孩才由美国军官交给罗兹瓦多的捷克斯洛伐克边境当局。三小时后，捷克斯洛伐克劳动队人员，才由武装的美军官兵押送到罗兹瓦多，在那里由德国海关职员移送给捷克斯洛伐克边境海关当局。
    捷外交部复文称：强力的劫持捷克劳动队和与他们一起的幼童，证明捷克斯洛伐克主权受到显然预谋的和严重的侵害。捷克斯洛伐克外交部坚决抗议此种行动，并要求美国大使馆对此种事件进行充分调查，并将对罪犯所已作的处置通知捷外交部。
