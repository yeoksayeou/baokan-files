The First Plenary Session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference
Speeches by Representatives of Various Units

**Chinese Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee Representative**
**Li Renren's Speech**

Chairman and fellow representatives:

I am from the area of Guangxi that is yet to be liberated. I went through many twists and turns and used various methods to reach the capital of the people, Beijing. Today, I have the honor to participate in the grand opening ceremony of the new China, which is not only a personal honor but also a great comfort to the 15 million people of Guangxi who are yet to be liberated. In the past few days, I have listened to Chairman Mao's opening speech and the speeches of various gentlemen. Regarding the great significance of this People's Political Consultative Conference and the three major bills that will soon be passed by the conference—the People's Political Consultative Conference Organization Law, the Common Program of the People's Political Consultative Conference, and the Organization Law of the Central People's Government—they have been thoroughly explained in terms of theory, practice, necessity, and effectiveness. We can only sincerely agree and unconditionally support them!

I would like to report some information about Guangxi for your reference. In the past, Guangxi gained some false reputation for having a well-organized base, trained masses, and a capable army. Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi relied on this capital to collude with American imperialism, attempting to gain American aid on one hand and to blackmail and extort supplies from the Kuomintang bandits on the other. They also wanted to stand on equal footing with the Communist Party to seek personal power. Li and Bai knew that their forces were no match for the Liberation Army and could not stay outside for long, so they dreamed of retreating to Guangxi to make a last stand. At the same time, they propagated to the cadres and the masses: "Guangxi is close to Annam, connected to Yunnan and Guizhou in the west, and exits to Qinliang in the east. The terrain is treacherous and can be defended for some time. American aid will surely come; the Third World War is about to break out, and then there will be a turning point. If you side with the Communist Party, your family will be broken up, and you will have no freedom in life." But this deceptive propaganda and shameless fantasy were clearly seen by the people and many cadres. Li and Bai were just trying to use them as sacrificial offerings. Look at the people of various counties in Guangxi, who have been continuously resisting Li's conscription and supply lines; and the areas that have risen up to organize armed forces for liberation number more than fifty counties, accounting for more than half of the province. Even among the young students, more than 20,000 have participated. When I left Guangxi, many people told me: "We eagerly hope that the Liberation Army will come quickly. We have been ready to welcome them! If you have a way to meet the leader of the people, Chairman Mao, and the Commander-in-Chief of the People's Liberation Army, General Zhu, please report to them the suffering we have endured and our fervent hope for the arrival of the Liberation Army." I believe that not only the people of Guangxi province think this way, but also the people in other areas yet to be liberated. This is just like the ancient saying: "Why should we come last and then be saved?" Just from this point, we can see that Li, who is at the end of his rope, will soon be annihilated. Friends who have long suffered with Li have all broken ties with them, and such a situation of widespread rebellion and estrangement will not end without annihilation! The other day, the leaders of the People's Liberation Army promised to quickly liberate Guangxi and other unliberated areas; I now also promise to the entire conference that the people of Guangxi will definitely stand on the side of the Liberation Army and will definitely advance under the leadership of Chairman Mao.

Now that the People's Political Consultative Conference has been successful and the Central People's Government is about to be established, the people of the whole country know that the new government is their own government and will naturally support it wholeheartedly; the affairs of the state are their own affairs, and they will naturally work hard for them. With the people as the foundation and the great leader of the people, Chairman Mao, as the guide, the future of the new China will definitely make great progress and have boundless brightness!

**Xinjiang Representative**
**Alimujiang's Speech**

Fellow representatives:

Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese people have shaken off the continuous tragedies of bloodshed and embarked on the path of true peace and democracy. From now on, no reactionary forces can bully the Chinese people. The liberation flag flying over the entire Chinese territory has strengthened the confidence of the people of the colonies and semi-colonies in Asia in their struggle for national liberation against imperialist rulers, and the great victory of the Chinese people has the profound historical significance of attracting the attention of the broad masses of the world.

We, the people of Xinjiang, in addition to unanimously supporting the three major historical documents passed by the conference, also guarantee to stand with the people of the whole country to jointly complete this great historical task.

For centuries, the people of Xinjiang have been fighting for freedom and liberation. We unanimously support the national policy in the Common Program formulated by this Political Consultative Conference and urge its implementation. We firmly believe that under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, we will definitely be able to solve our national problems thoroughly according to the principles of Marxism and Leninism.

We guarantee that the people of Xinjiang will resolutely implement all the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference and unanimously respond to all the calls of Chairman Mao.

Advance victoriously under the banner of Marx and Lenin!

Long live the People's Republic of China!

Long live the great leader of the people, Chairman Mao Zedong!

**North China Liberation Area Representative**
**Lan Gongwu's Speech**

Chairman and fellow representatives:

The opinions of our unit have already been stated by Comrade Bo Yibo, the chief representative. I would like to share some of my thoughts.

In the past, many people used to say, "The Chinese are like a pile of loose sand and cannot unite." Indeed, during the rule of the Qing Dynasty, the Beiyang War Lords, and the Kuomintang reactionaries, the people saw only treason and harm to the people, corruption and decadence, and suffered only oppression and exploitation, massacre and imprisonment. The people naturally could not unite and could not possibly unite. Today, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, the situation is completely different. The Communist Party relies on the power of the masses to carry out the revolutionary cause. In the liberated areas, the people have united and organized, becoming a great revolutionary force. The defeat of the Japanese invaders and the Kuomintang reactionaries was achieved by this united force. In today's people's conference, all the parties and classes that were once considered irreconcilable have united, becoming a great force for building a new China. And they have established a long-lasting form—the Organization Law of the People's Political Consultative Conference. We have indeed recognized a great truth here.

In the past, many people also used to say, "Democracy is not suitable for China." Indeed, after the Xinhai Revolution, the parliamentary politics that were once practiced were modeled after Europe and America and had poor results, thus losing the sympathy of the people. But is this because democracy is not suitable for China? No, it is because the old democracy we imitated was a political system of dictatorship by a minority bourgeoisie, fundamentally not a democratic system of the masses. Again, because of the different interests of various factions and individuals within the minority bourgeoisie, they were jealous of each other, thus the system they formulated divided state power into several power organs that were mutually opposed and mutually restrained. This system was only for the benefit of a minority and could not serve the masses, could only be a tool for power struggles, and could not be an institution for implementing policies. The famous political maxim of the United States, "obstruction and balance," is indeed true. However, what is obstructed is the policy of national welfare, and what is balanced is the private interests of politicians and officials. As for the new democracy, it is the democracy of the people. The government is produced by the people and supported by the people. The power of the people is the power of the government. The government has the power to implement policies, and the people have the power to supervise the government, fundamentally different from the old democracy. Fellow representatives know more about new democracy than I do, so I will not say more.

Although I am over sixty years old, I do not feel old. I will definitely study hard and work hard to strive for the construction of a new China.

**First Field Army of the People's Liberation Army Representative**
**Zhao Shoushan's Speech**

Chairman and fellow representatives:

The convening of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference marks a turning point in our great China's history, forever freeing us from the fate of being a semi-feudal, semi-colonial country. It is a new era. I am honored to participate in this grand gathering and will, with all my enthusiasm, stand on the military post, sincerely support the spirit of the conference, and execute all the resolutions of the conference.

The three documents proposed by this conference are the best form of unity of the people's great unity in this period and the most appropriate action program. I will strive for their complete realization.

I was once a high-ranking officer of the Kuomintang reactionary government, but as early as more than ten years ago, I had repeatedly felt his betrayal of the revolution, dictatorship, and selling out the country, caring only for the interests of a few and not for the suffering of the people. Therefore, in the December 12th Incident, I resolutely participated. After the war of resistance began, I led my troops to defend the Zhongtiao Mountains for two and a half years and the Yellow River Iron Bridge for two years and seven months. My principle was to unite and progress, and to resist Japan together. Therefore, Chiang Kai-shek said I was a mouthpiece of the Communist Party. I received eight rounds of reactionary training from Chiang Kai-shek. My progressive friends jokingly called me an expert in receiving training. Chiang Kai-shek said I was getting worse with each training. Indeed, in Chiang Kai-shek's eyes, I was getting worse with each training. Because I saw that he was truly "saying nice things and doing evil deeds," speaking of peace while secretly giving the army "bandit suppression" manuals; on the one hand, holding political consultative conferences, and on the other hand, holding bandit suppression conferences; such a hypocritical and deceptive behavior made us soldiers who sacrificed on the battlefield shiver with cold and indignation! However, fortunately, during the eight years of resistance, my defense area was adjacent to or near the Eighth Route Army. I also received the command of General Zhu and Peng, the Commander-in-Chief and Vice Commander-in-Chief, and thus saw the excellent discipline, brave and tenacious fighting of the people's army, leaving a deep impression on my mind, beginning my sincere desire to learn from the Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army, and thus making the greatest decision to take risks and hardships to join the liberated area. In the leadership of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, I am a sincere student.

I am an old soldier, and old ideas often surface in my mind. I hope that advanced comrades will often correct me, and I also hope that friends like me will come together to reform ourselves. We must learn Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, gradually change our past bad thoughts, habits, attitudes, and styles, improve our officer-soldier relationships and military-civilian relationships, and advance together to complete the great cause of liberating the whole of China, and to quickly implement the tasks given to us by the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.

In the conference the other day, Comrade Guo Moruo said: "The paper tiger of American imperialism has been exposed, and we will continue to expose it, exposing it until it is wounded all over and loses its shape." Comrade Guo is a world-renowned great literary figure. He uses his pen to expose it and calls on all literary and artistic workers to join in. We revolutionary soldiers, in order to defend world peace, must also be prepared with various weapons, fix bayonets, and fiercely expose it to "a mess, a mess on the ground," and finally burn it with fire!

Let us shout:

Long live the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference!

Long live the People's Republic of China!

Long live Chairman Mao!

Long live Commander-in-Chief Zhu!

**Chinese Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee Representative**
**Li Xijiu's Speech**

Chairman and fellow representatives:

I am very happy and honored to speak at this grand gathering that shows the unprecedented unity of the Chinese people and has great historical significance!

The main task of this conference is to pass the three historical documents: the Organization Law of the People's Political Consultative Conference, the Common Program of the People's Political Consultative Conference, and the Organization Law of the Central People's Government. As pointed out by the representatives who spoke in the past three days, these three documents are the blueprint for the Chinese people to build their own country. They appropriately reflect the urgent needs of the people of the whole country and also take into account the interests of various democratic classes, domestic minorities, and overseas Chinese. The people of the whole country not only sincerely agree with and support them but also wish to make joint efforts under the leadership of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China and Chairman Mao of the Communist Party to achieve their thorough implementation.

The Chinese people have struggled for more than a hundred years to free themselves from the shackles of imperialism and feudalism and to build their own democratic country. The revolutionary ideal of the Three Principles of the People, proposed by the founder of our party, Mr. Sun Yat-sen, was put forward in the process of this struggle. Mr. Sun devoted his life to the revolutionary cause of the Chinese people, and his revolutionary ideals also progressed with the times, constantly developing and improving their content. Today, the old Three Principles of the People have become a thing of the past, and the revolutionary Three Principles of the People must also be further developed. The new Three Principles of the People should be the same in content as the new democracy, truly embodying the revolutionary spirit of Mr. Sun. Those who truly understand Mr. Sun's revolutionary spirit should not be "stuck in their old ways" but must bravely advance and catch up with the times.

From today on, the revolutionary cause of the Chinese people has entered a new stage. The Chinese people have, with their own strength, thoroughly overthrown the reactionary rule of the enemy and achieved basic victory. We will now begin the new work of building our own country. As long as the people of the whole country contribute all their wisdom and make joint efforts, a new China that meets the wishes of the people will be quickly built. Here, I would like to say a few words about the wishes and responsibilities of the people of North China. The people of North China have suffered from the trampling of imperialist armed invasions and the long-term trampling of warlords and the Kuomintang reactionary rule for nearly a hundred years. Therefore, the people of North China have the most urgent expectations for the establishment of their own country. So, in the eight years of the War of Resistance and the three years of the People's Liberation War, the people of North China, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, stood up and first overthrew the rule of imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and endured great burdens to support the front line, making the People's Liberation War finally achieve nationwide victory. In the future, the main task facing the people of the new China is to transform the backward agricultural country into a modern industrial country of new democracy. North China is blessed with many heavy industrial resources and vast rural areas for producing industrial raw materials. In the upcoming economic construction, the people of North China will bear a very important responsibility. Most of North China is an old liberated area, and various places have already completed land reform under the leadership of the Communist Party of China. I believe they will also be able to show great determination in the construction of the new democratic economy and undertake the main responsibility.

Finally, let us shout:

Long live the success of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference!

Long live the People's Republic of China!

Long live the Communist Party of China!

Long live Commander-in-Chief Zhu!

Long live the leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao!

**Fourth Field Army of the People's Liberation Army Representative**
**Zhang Zhen's Speech**

Chairman and fellow representatives:

The convening of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference is a great manifestation of the unity of the Chinese people. I am a soldier from a newly reorganized unit, and it is a great pleasure and excitement for me to express my opinions here.

Chiang Kai-shek, with his gangster methods, used the name of the Three Principles of the People to do the opposite, and this has long been despised by the hearts of the people. Especially after the eight years of the War of Resistance, the whole country was exhausted, and everyone yearned for peace and recovery. Only Chiang Kai-shek, regardless of his name, sabotaged the Political Consultative Conference and launched a large-scale civil war. At that time, I also participated in it. When General Liu Bochen crossed the river to the south, I, as the deputy chief of the Wuhan Military Affairs Office, commanded a powerful army to block General Liu Bochen's development in the Dabie Mountains. This was my participation in the counter-revolutionary and anti-people crimes with the Chiang-Bai bandits, making me feel endless pain in my heart.

However, at that time, although I commanded fourteen whole regiments, I was actually empty-handed, not even having the basic strength of a battalion or a company. It was not until September last year that I became the governor of Henan Province and began to organize troops, establishing five provincial security brigades and four pacification brigades, expanding and reorganizing on the one hand, and inciting Bai Chongxi to launch an anti-Chiang and pro-Communist movement on the other, negotiating for two months. Due to my lack of understanding of Bai, Bai Chongxi's anti-Chiang was actually a plot to take over in the name of Li Zongren to realize his conspiracy of borrowing American aid to launch a counter-revolution. Although he sent people to contact the Communist Party, it was only a delaying tactic. This is known to Comrades Li Renren, Huang Shao, and Liu Fei, who participated in the inner circle. I went to Changsha twice to discuss grand strategies with General Peng Chuan, but both times were seen through by Bai Chongxi. Therefore, three days before the liberation of Wuhan, Bai Chongxi surrounded my command post at Heping Bridge and called me to Wuhan for a meeting, almost detaining me. I had no choice but to sneak to Jinkou alone and join the people's line.

After the uprising, only more than 20,000 broken troops remained, all of which were feudal cliques, and even counter-revolutionary elements. In a short period, under the magnanimity of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, we were issued the regular number of the People's Liberation Army's Fifty-first Army, which was a great honor for us. In Wuhan, we also received sincere, frank, enthusiastic, and special care from the leaders of the Fourth Field Army and the Twelfth Army Group, who sent various levels of political workers to help educate us, reforming our thoughts and actions, giving us new life. Speaking of this, I cannot help but be deeply moved by the great spirit of Chairman Mao, and I cannot help but admire the great success of Mao Zedong Thought.

Now that the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference has been convened, I will, with unlimited enthusiasm, support the three great documents resolved by the conference. In the future, I am willing to learn all the excellent styles of the Communist Party under the leadership of Chairman Mao, reform my own thoughts. I am willing to learn all the perfect systems of the People's Liberation Army under the command of Commander-in-Chief Zhu, cleanse the bad habits of the troops. I am willing to do my best to help the local government of Henan, eliminate bandits and local bullies, and I am willing to follow the advanced Liberation Army to completely annihilate the remaining forces of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits and thoroughly shatter the illusions of American imperialist aggression, achieving permanent peace for China.

Long live the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference!

Long live the People's Republic of China!

Long live Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu!

**Independent Democratic Personage Representative**
**Li Da's Speech**

I speak from the standpoint of a social scientist.

In the three major documents drafted at this conference, I believe that the Common Program is the most basic document. The Organization Law of the Political Consultative Conference and the Government Organization Law are actually written based on this program. We can say that the Common Program is the fundamental law of the People's Republic of China.

Secondly, this program summarizes nearly a hundred years of experience in the history of the Chinese revolution, mainly based on Mao Zedong's "On New Democracy," "On the Coalition Government," "On People's Democratic Dictatorship," and other works, and was drafted. We can say that this program is a concrete manifestation of Mao Zedong Thought.

Thirdly, this program draft was discussed and revised many times by small groups and the Standing Committee during the preparatory period and was supplemented and discussed by all representatives in two groups. Since Chairman Mao delivered the opening speech at this formal conference, more than seventy representatives from various units have spoken and expressed their unanimous support for this program and their willingness to strive for its realization. We can say that this program represents the unanimous will and universal will of more than 470 million people in China, a great democratic charter of the Chinese people.

Therefore, from the perspective of social science, the Common Program is a textbook of Marxism-Leninism that combines theory and practice in the new democratic era of China. I propose that the Ministry of Education of the new government to be established should make the Common Program a compulsory course for all departments of universities and a compulsory course for all levels of high schools, and compile a simple book to be used as a textbook for primary schools.

At the same time, we social scientists, standing on the platform of Marxism-Leninism, must regard this Common Program as only the political program of the new democracy. In the future, there will be a socialist political program to replace it. The new democratic era is a transitional period from a semi-feudal, semi-colonial society to a socialist society, which is a necessary stage in the development of Chinese society. When we study and propagate this Common Program, we must pay attention to the socialist goal. For example, in the fourth chapter of this program, economic policy lists five categories of economies and proposes the principle of "balancing public and private interests." But from the spirit of new democracy, the socialist nature of state-owned enterprises is superior to the other four economies. With the development of the new democratic economy, the socialist nature of the economy will gradually develop and gradually overcome the capitalist economy. This is inevitable. Again, in the fifth article, it is stipulated that people have freedom of thought. This means that Marxist-Leninist thought and non-Marxist-Leninist thought are equally free. But under the people's democratic government led by the working class, Marxist-Leninist thought leads non-Marxist-Leninist thought. With the development of the new democratic society, Marxist-Leninist thought will completely negate non-Marxist-Leninist thought. This is also inevitable. In the new democratic era, peaceful class struggle (economic, political, and ideological) will continue. Therefore, when we engage in the study or writing of new philosophy, new historiography, new economics, new political science, and new jurisprudence, we must, on the one hand, emphasize the spirit of this Common Program, and on the other hand, our thoughts and pen must point towards socialism, indicating the direction of socialism to the broad readers and workers. Only in this way can we correctly propagate Mao Zedong Thought and raise the level of social science.

**Special Invited Representative**
**Lin Zun's Speech**

Chairman, fellow representatives, and guests:

I am honored to participate in this conference. I have participated in many joint studies of the three drafts: the Common Program, the Organization Law of the Political Consultative Conference, and the Organization Law of the Central People's Government, and I firmly support them as a comprehensive expression of the will of the people of the whole country.

I am a naval officer and think of the past when the Chinese Navy, from the Qing Dynasty to the Kuomintang reactionary era, was used as a tool for counter-revolution and anti-people. Therefore, naval personnel were oppressed, enslaved, and sealed off in the past long period. The reactionaries did not allow you to study social science theory, did not allow you to discuss political issues, and did not allow you to have contact with society. Although naval personnel had pure thoughts and professional skills and were willing to strive for the construction of a navy to defend the coast and resist foreign aggression, the reactionaries did not want you to do this. They either embezzled naval funds, making the navy helpless, or wanted you to be their special group's slaves, their weapons for counter-revolution and anti-people. They did not care about defending the country or protecting the interests of the people, so for nearly a hundred years, the Chinese Navy could not be established.

But the revolutionary tide is unstoppable. The oppressed naval personnel also have their revolutionary history. For example, during the Xinhai Revolution, Huang Zhongying and others led the Haiqian and other ships to revolt in Wuhan; during the Second Revolution, Cheng Bi and others led the Haiqing and other ships to participate in the Guangzhou Revolutionary Government; during the Northern Expedition, Guo Shousheng and others led the Jianwei and other ships to participate in the Shanghai People's Uprising. In this liberation war, such facts have become more numerous, such as the uprising of the Huang'an warship in February this year, the uprising of the Chongqing warship by Deng Zhaoxiang, the uprising of various ships and flotillas of the Second Fleet in April, and the recent uprising of the Changzhi warship. In addition, there are uprisings that failed, participation in underground work, and many who did not want to continue serving the reactionaries and took risks to join the people's line. This proves that awakened naval officers, once they have the opportunity, will follow the revolutionary tide.

Our future goals for naval comrades: first, to cooperate with our land and air forces to continue the liberation war, completely annihilate the reactionaries, and completely liberate Taiwan, Penghu, and Hainan Island; second, to strive to build a navy that defends the independence and integrity of China's territorial sovereignty. These two goals are what the Common Program of the Political Consultative Conference has indicated to us and are also what we have been hoping for in the past and present. We believe that with the support of the people of the whole country and under the leadership of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, we will definitely be able to accomplish these tasks soon. We call out to the naval officers and soldiers oppressed by the reactionaries: wake up quickly, raise your banners of righteousness, and join the people's ranks. This is your future!

Long live the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference!

Long live the People's Republic of China!

Long live Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu!

**All-China Democratic Youth League Representative**
**Fan Xiaofeng's Speech**

Fellow representatives:

In the few days of discussion at the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, representatives from all sides have unanimously and enthusiastically supported the three major documents of the conference. This fully proves the correctness of the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the leadership of the leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao. I believe that the workers, students, women, youth, and the broad masses of the whole country will definitely implement all the resolutions made by the conference, realize our Common Program, and advance towards the construction of an independent, democratic, peaceful, unified, and prosperous new China.

I am a young female worker, born into a poor peasant family. Due to the exploitation of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, the vast rural areas of China have been bankrupted, and I had no way to live in the countryside. I was forced to go to Shanghai at the age of twelve and had to work in a factory as an apprentice. For the past seventeen years, I have worked in the British Jardine Spinning and Weaving Mill, the Japanese Nanshan Spinning and Weaving Mill, and the bureaucratic capitalist China Textile Mill No. 1 of the Kuomintang, living a life of hunger and cold like cattle and horses. In these seventeen long years, I have suffered all kinds of slavery and oppression, and the suffering is endless. But I did not surrender, especially after I received the leadership of the Communist Party of China, I saw clearly the future, I participated in the anti-Japanese and salvation movements, and various struggles inside and outside the factory, opposing the oppression and attacks of imperialism and bureaucratic capitalism on the Chinese working class. Although we suffered various brutal suppressions and were arrested and imprisoned, we were not frightened. At that time, we firmly believed that the reactionaries would one day be finished, and light would definitely come. Indeed, Shanghai was liberated, and all the people of Shanghai saw the sun together.

Now, the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference has declared the death of the old China and the birth of the new China. There is no more slavery of workers, persecution of youth, and insult and oppression of women. Today, I—a young female worker—can stand on the podium of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and speak, which is an unprecedented event in the five-thousand-year history of China. I feel the highest honor! This is the honor of the Chinese workers! The honor of Chinese women! The honor of Chinese youth! The honor of the Chinese people!

The Chinese working class is highly respected today and has become the master of the country. This is the result of the blood and sacrifice of countless martyrs. We also feel the great responsibility today. We must use all our efforts to overcome all kinds of difficulties in construction and must smash the conspiracies and sabotage of imperialism and reactionary remnants to defend our motherland. Although there are difficulties on the road ahead, we have the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. Under his leadership, we will definitely be able to overcome all difficulties and defeat all enemies, and win a better future!

**Special Invited Representative**
**Deng Zhaoxiang's Speech**

Chairman and fellow representatives:

I and the officers and soldiers who participated in the uprising of the Chongqing warship and the Lingfu warship, who continued to participate, are training and learning at the Northeast People's Liberation Army Naval School, receiving preferential treatment from the people and the government. Today, I am also honored to participate in the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and feel unlimited excitement! For the three national construction charters discussed at the conference, I dare to guarantee that the entire Northeast People's Liberation Army Naval School will definitely follow the instructions of Commander-in-Chief Zhu the day before yesterday at the conference and carry them out in earnest.

I feel that for decades, China has suffered from the invasion and oppression of imperialism, mainly because there is no coastal defense. Why can't we build coastal defense? It is because from the Qing Dynasty to the era of the war criminal Chiang Kai-shek's dictatorship, they all colluded with imperialists to oppress and exploit the masses. Therefore, they did not want China to have a force to protect the interests of the people and build a navy, so it was hopeless.

Now that the people's revolution has been victorious, the Central People's Government is about to be proclaimed. The regulations of the Common Program and the instructions of Chairman Mao all require the construction of the Chinese Navy. Therefore, we know that after the victory of the revolution, the construction of the navy is absolutely necessary. However, in the initial stage of building a new navy, we must have a movement to build a new navy. We must expand the propaganda of naval construction so that the people of the whole country and overseas Chinese can all realize the importance of naval construction and unanimously support the future government's plan for naval construction. In this way, after a certain period, we will definitely be able to build a strong navy. Finally, we sincerely congratulate the success of the conference!

**Domestic Minority Nationalities Representative**
**Zhang Chong's Speech**

Chairman and fellow representatives:

I am a representative of the Yi nationality, one of the minority nationalities. We Yi people have long been oppressed and discriminated against. People call us barbarians and wild animals and do not treat us as humans. But today, we have become humans and even the masters of the country, participating in this unprecedented conference in Chinese history. It is indeed an unprecedented honor and excitement.

The common opinions of the minority nationalities have already been reported by Comrade Liu Geping, the chief representative of our unit. I will not repeat them. I firmly support the three major documents drafted by the Preparatory Committee and will strive for their complete realization.

The Yi nationality I represent is mostly resident in Yunnan. Neighboring provinces such as Guangxi, Guizhou, Sichuan, Tibet, Xikang, and neighboring countries such as Siam, Burma, and Annam all have our blood brothers. We originally lived in the plains of the Hengduan Mountains, but the fertile land was seized by the rulers of the Great Han chauvinism. However, the laboring class brothers of the Han nationality in those places did not reduce their suffering because of the fertility of the land. They also suffered from the cruel exploitation of the Han ruling class along with the laboring class of the minority nationalities.

We have been fighting against wild beasts in the high mountains and deep valleys and against human beasts. The Hengduan Mountains are full of mines and waterfalls, which can be resources for national prosperity. Now, millions of soldiers of the People's Liberation Army are advancing towards the border, and our people and various brother nationalities, under the leadership of the Communist Party, have already established their own armed forces in various regions and are preparing to welcome the arrival of the great army of the People's Liberation Army.

To ensure permanent liberation, we must implement the national policy of the Common Program, resolutely oppose the public enemies within the minority nationalities. Our Yi nationality had heroes in the past, but also had traitors to the nation. The former governor of Yunnan, Lu Han, was a traitor. In 1945, he betrayed Long Yun, betrayed Yunnan, and betrayed the 80,000 brave soldiers of Yunnan, sending them to the icy and snowy Northeast to be the cannon fodder for the Kuomintang bandits' anti-people war, in exchange for his position as the slave manager of Yunnan, allowing the Kuomintang bandits to complete their war preparations and eliminate their worries, launching an attack on the liberated areas. In the past four years, a series of massacres have occurred in Yunnan, such as the February 21 massacre, the Li Wen massacre, and the July 15 massacre. Lu Han is responsible for all of these. Half a year ago, in the massacre of more than 20 people at the Central Bank in Kunming, Lu Han was also responsible. Recently, due to the development of the revolutionary victory, the collapse of the Kuomintang regime is imminent, and Lu Han is in a panic. He is both colluding with the Kuomintang bandits and pretending to be enlightened. General Yang Jie's delayed departure from Yunnan is related to this. At the beginning of this month, in the so-called Kunming Incident, he once again betrayed the people, closed the newspaper office, dissolved the anti-Kuomintang Provincial Council, dissolved universities and high schools, and arrested democratic personages. General Yang Jie was forced to leave Kunming in this sudden change and was poisoned by special agents in Hong Kong. Some people say that Lu Han's situation is difficult, but the difficulty is limited. If he can set an example like Beijing, Changsha, and Suiyuan, he will definitely be forgiven under Chairman Mao's policy of leniency. Otherwise, he will only hasten his own destruction. He thinks that Yunnan is far away in the mountains and is close to the imperialist colonies, but in fact, our people have long seen through his true face. Tens of thousands of brave soldiers of Yunnan have awakened and are ready to return to liberate their hometowns. Even if there is a corner of the world, how can he escape?

The liberation cause of the small nationalities is linked with the liberation cause of the whole Chinese people. The great national theories of Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin, and Chairman Mao point out the correct path for us.

Small nationalities can only achieve thorough liberation under the leadership of the Communist Party of China. Today, the enemy is still struggling and constantly plotting, trying to sabotage unity and incite brotherly nationalities. This is what we must first be vigilant about. Therefore, we must, under the leadership of the Communist Party, unite into a solid line, oppose imperialism and the public enemies within various nationalities, and make the People's Republic of China a big family of friendly cooperation among various nationalities. Let us shout:

Long live the unity of the Chinese nationalities!

Long live the People's Republic of China!

Long live the leader of the people, Chairman Mao!

**Special Invited Representative**
**Huang Qixiang's Speech**

Chairman and fellow representatives:

First of all, I would like to declare that I am speaking from a personal standpoint. The three national construction plans completed by the People's Political Consultative Conference, although only now completed the legal procedures, their embryonic form has long been formed in the speeches of Chairman Mao Zedong and the various documents of the Communist Party of China over the years. The Chinese people's struggle for a hundred years has not been in vain. The three documents fully reflect the demands of the broad masses of the Chinese people. This is the crystallization of Mao Zedong Thought and also the fruit of the struggle of the Communist Party of China.

For more than twenty years, I have been groping in the political circle. I have been inspired at times and have been lost at other times. The development of the revolution is so complicated and intricate that it is not easy to see clearly and grasp firmly. Now I firmly believe that China has embarked on a bright and great future.

I will not express any opinions on the three national construction plans. I would like to say a few words about my personal thoughts.

Perhaps someone will doubt: even if the plan is good, who can guarantee that it will not become a blank check? My answer is: a government without the support of the people can easily issue blank checks, but the result will definitely be overthrown by the people, just like the Kuomintang reactionaries. The Communist Party is a party that has grown up with the support of the people. The people's government it leads directly represents the interests of the people, and the checks are impossible not to be cashed.

Someone says: "The Communist Party does not keep its word. How can you believe it?" But my experience tells me that the Communist Party is the most trustworthy.

Someone else says: "Why should foreign relations be one-sided? We stand between the Soviet Union and the United States, use them, mediate them, and be a bridge. Isn't that good?" Fellow representatives, I have also thought this way. I went to Europe two years ago to actually observe the policies of the two major powers, the United States and the Soviet Union, after the war, and whether there is any possibility of coordination. What is the real situation in Europe? I hoped to understand the world problem from the European problem and also helped me understand the Chinese revolution problem. After arriving in Berlin, I saw clearly that the expansion policy of American imperialism was rampant in post-war Europe, but it was blocked by the Soviet Union and the democratic countries of Eastern Europe. Despite the internal anxiety of the United States, it shouted for war, but it did not frighten the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union firmly grasped the policy of peace, neither invading nor yielding. Western European countries were in dire poverty after the war. The so-called Marshall Aid Plan of the United States was actually like giving blood on one side and drawing blood on the other. Especially for the German problem, the American imperialists had no sincere intention to solve it. Their desire was to turn West Germany into an economic and military fortress to attack the Soviet Union. Now I understand: as long as imperialism exists for a day, it will not be willing to cooperate with the Soviet Union and any other people's countries. Can we mediate them in this way?

Again, take its policy towards China. Why does it insist on supporting the Kuomintang reactionaries? It is because the people's liberation movement is fundamentally incompatible with the interests of imperialism. Can we use it?

We must know that today, the wealth of American imperialism is obtained from internal and external exploitation. If it allows the Chinese people to be liberated, it is equivalent to voluntarily abandoning the object of exploitation. Will it be so stupid? Today, the United States and the Soviet Union, one is our enemy and the other is our friend. We cannot have equal treatment for them. The good dream of being a "bridge between the United States and the Soviet Union" has long passed, and we must wake up!

Fellow representatives, we are not afraid of the blockade policy encouraged by American imperialism. A hundred years ago, imperialists used cannons to break open our country's door to demand trade, to achieve their purposes of invasion and exploitation. Now, seeing that the Chinese people have stood up, they can no longer continue to exploit, so they want to blockade us. This shameless and contradictory policy will harm the American imperialists themselves, not us. Let them blockade, we Chinese people who are used to hard work will just take this opportunity to create and build.

Our new democratic China will bring a new era in Chinese history, which is undeniable! With the leadership of Chairman Mao, the cooperation of various democratic parties and the vast majority of the people of the country, and the strong People's Liberation Army as the guard, the government is solid. The planned production and economic construction will definitely improve the living standards of the people, and the majority of the people will also have the opportunity to receive cultural education. Various brother nationalities will harmoniously unite. In diplomacy, we cooperate with the Soviet Union, cooperate with new democratic countries, and cooperate with revolutionary people of various countries. We support world peace and believe that the Soviet Union and China have enough strength to guarantee peace. We will resolutely oppose American imperialism to the end.

Fellow representatives, the establishment of the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union's public announcement of having atomic weapons are two events that are worth recording in today's world history! Let us shout:

Long live the People's Republic of China!

Long live world peace!

Title: Speeches at the First Session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference

**Long Live Chairman Mao!**

**Speech by Wang Guoxing, Representative of Minority Nationalities**

Minority nationalities have always been considered by the ruling class as fit only for hard labor, providing money, grain, and serving as slaves. They have never had a share in discussing national affairs.

Today is different. The Communist Party not only distributes land to us but also gives us the right to participate in discussing national affairs.

We must forever follow the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. Only then will all our rights be guaranteed, and our future will be bright and prosperous.

We fully support all the resolutions of the People's Political Consultative Conference. We also pledge to convey the spirit and resolutions of this conference to every member of the Li ethnic group. They will celebrate it as they celebrate the New Year and will implement it step by step.

We also hope that everyone will give us more help in improving our political, economic, and cultural standards in the future.

Finally, I wish Chairman Mao, General Zhu, and all the representatives good health.

**Speech by Lin Liru, Representative of the Preparatory Committee of the All-China Federation of Education Workers**

We, the representatives of education workers, unanimously agree with the three documents, as reported by the chief representative. Now, I would like to add a few points regarding our understanding of Chapter Five of the Common Program and the focus of future educational work:

First, in the future, our science, arts, and education must serve the new democratic politics and economy without reservation. The past view that science, education, and arts can be independent of politics is false, erroneous, and ultimately serves reactionary politics unknowingly. We must resolutely and thoroughly abandon this erroneous view.

Second, future educational work must focus on the working and peasant classes as the primary targets. The working and peasant classes, who make up more than 80% of the population, are the main force against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. They are also the main force for building a new nation. They have long been oppressed under the reactionary regime and have been isolated from culture and education. Now, the people's government must quickly compensate for their losses. The program's Article 41, which aims to raise the cultural level of the people, should primarily focus on the working and peasant classes. As for "cultivating talents for national construction," we must not only reform young and old intellectuals but also pay more attention to cultivating a large number of intellectuals from the working and peasant classes. Only then can we truly serve the majority of the people.

Third, the program's Article 46 clearly states that the educational method should be a unity of theory and practice. This is to thoroughly reform the errors of old education. Old education has always been monopolized by landlords and bureaucrats, who use education to create qualifications and adorn their status. Therefore, it must be detached from actual life. In the future, culture and education should become tools for the people to carry out revolutionary struggles and build a new nation. Therefore, they must be combined with the people's revolutionary struggle needs and the state's economic and political construction.

In summary, our understanding is that the focus of future educational work should be on the working and peasant classes. Only then can education become a tool for serving the people and a weapon for defending and developing people's democratic dictatorship.

**Speech by Zhu Deshi, Representative of Minority Nationalities**

Chairman, distinguished representatives:

The fact that the Korean people in China's Northeast can send representatives to participate in today's national political consultation conference and jointly discuss state affairs is a great honor and immense encouragement for us Korean people. I represent the more than 1.2 million Korean people in the Northeast and fully agree with the speech by the chief representative of the minority nationalities, Liu Geping. I firmly support the three major documents of the conference and will strive for their thorough implementation.

Distinguished representatives, for nearly a hundred years, especially since the Japanese invaders annexed Korea, the Korean people, unwilling to suffer the pain of losing their country and unable to live in their homeland, fled to the brotherly country of China, worked hard, and opened up vast, uninhabited wastelands. They were full of hope and lived harmoniously with the Chinese people. However, the feudal landlords and warlords in the Northeast, in collusion with the Japanese, stirred up trouble between the Chinese and Korean peoples and implemented a reactionary regime of exploitation and oppression. The hardworking and brave Korean people, however, have always been unyielding in their struggle against the reactionary regime!

Even before the "September 18 Incident," the Korean people in the Northeast, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, stood in the same ranks as the Chinese people and fought against the Japanese invaders and the Northeast feudal landlords and warlords. After the "September 18 Incident," the Korean people, together with the Chinese people, fought a fourteen-year guerrilla war against our common enemy—Japanese imperialism and the puppet state of Manchukuo. In the early days of "August 15," the Korean people in the Northeast stood firmly under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, seized weapons, assisted the Soviet Union, and marched to defeat the Japanese invaders, liberate all of Northeast China, and eliminate the remaining enemy forces. When Chiang Kai-shek "seized" the Northeast, the Korean people, together with the people of the Northeast, participated in the three-year self-defense war, defeating the reactionaries. In this great struggle, land reform was carried out, and every Korean person, like the people of the Northeast, received the same amount of land, livestock, farming tools, houses, and other living necessities according to population. They also participated in the political, economic, and cultural construction of the liberated areas on an equal footing (now more than 6,000 ethnic cadres have been trained to participate in various jobs, and there is one university, four normal schools, seventy-plus middle schools, and more than 1,500 primary schools, and an ethnic newspaper has been published). This has completely liberated the Korean people, who have long suffered oppression and hardship!

It must be pointed out that the victories the Korean people have achieved today are due to the correct national policies led by the Chinese Communist Party and the great unity and joint struggle of all ethnic groups in China! The Korean people in the Northeast are a part of the Chinese nation and a member of the Chinese family of ethnic groups!

Therefore, the Korean people in the Northeast must forever unite with the people of all ethnic groups in China, under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and under the leadership of the soon-to-be-established Central People's Government, strive to build a new democratic China!

Long live the founding of the People's Republic of China!

Long live the success of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference!

Long live Chairman Mao!

Long live General Zhu!

**Speech by Zhu Zaoquan, Representative of the Miao Ethnic Group**

Chairman, distinguished representatives:

The success of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference marks a new era for the entire Chinese nation to stand tall in the world. It is also the day when the millions of Miao people, who have been oppressed and enslaved for thousands of years in the ancient and simple southwestern border, have a great turnaround.

The reactionary rulers in Chinese history have also issued some good-looking proclamations, but to the oppressed Miao people, they are worthless. Because the essence of those things is the tool of the reactionary rulers to oppress and deceive the people and will not benefit the people in the slightest.

Today, the three documents drafted by our People's Political Consultative Conference are our own charter of the Chinese people and are truly suitable for the immediate needs of every ethnic group, especially the Miao people. Once they hear about it, they will feel a warmth and joy they have never had before. Because from now on, the Miao people have truly become a member of the family of friendly cooperation among all ethnic groups and will no longer suffer any ethnic oppression and discrimination.

More than ten years ago, when the Chinese Communist Party and our Chairman Mao, along with General Zhu, led the Red Army northward to resist Japan and embarked on the Long March, they once traveled through the southwestern Miao area. The Miao people had a personal experience of this family warmth and ethnic unity, although it was brief, it left an unforgettable impression. For many years, the Miao people have been praying and hoping for this warmth and closeness to come quickly. They said: "If the guests (the Miao people call the Han people guests) are like the Red Army, we won't have to rebel every sixty years!" (The Miao people have a tradition of rebelling every sixty years) From this, we can see that the Miao people, like other ethnic brothers in China, love peace and are not the "barbaric" and "unsubmissive to the emperor" as the reactionary rulers often slander and insult us!

Once the People's Republic of China is proclaimed, the Miao people will, under the wise leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, under the leadership of the Central People's Government, and with the help of friendly ethnic brothers, build our family with our hardworking and enduring lifestyle and diligent and careful spirit. We will also strive to improve ourselves in culture and education. We enthusiastically celebrate the success of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and the birth of the People's Republic of China!

**Speech by Tian Fuda, Representative of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government Alliance, Gaoshan Ethnic Group**

Chairman Mao, General Zhu, distinguished representatives:

I am a representative of the Gaoshan ethnic group, a minority nationality in the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government Alliance unit, participating in this conference. The fact that a representative of the Gaoshan people, with a population of only about 300,000, can participate in this conference makes me feel an unprecedented excitement and honor!

The convening of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference has brought a new life of ethnic equality and cooperation to the Gaoshan people, who are about to be quickly liberated. It will guide us towards a new, civilized, scientific, and healthy path! From now on, we can get rid of the old ethnic life of being invaded, oppressed, insulted, divided, instigated, and uncivilized, backward, primitive, even barbaric, and dark.

The Gaoshan people are the original inhabitants of Taiwan. Over the past three hundred years, they have suffered from the ruthless exploitation, harm, and massacre by invaders such as the Dutch, Spanish, Qing Dynasty, and Japan. During this period, the Gaoshan people have continuously fought bitter battles against these invaders, but were eventually driven into the mountains where ordinary people cannot survive. Especially during the Japanese imperialist rule, the Gaoshan people originally had more than ten tribes, but due to several massacres, only seven tribes remained. The population decreased. In October 1930, the highland people of Wushe rebelled against the Japanese imperialists and fought a hard battle for more than a month with their armed police, army, and air force. Although our strength was weak, we used the advantages of the mountains and did not surrender. In the end, they used airplanes to spread poison gas throughout the mountains, and thus this tribe was completely annihilated. Although this rebellion also failed, the spirit of the martyrs who led this rebellion, especially the anti-imperialist spirit of Hua Gang Yilang, will forever be remembered by the Gaoshan people. After the Kuomintang reactionary regime took over Taiwan, it continued to oppress, exploit, discriminate against, and massacre the Gaoshan people and other ethnic groups. This fact has taught us that our suffering is not just a matter of ethnic oppression but a matter of oppression by all reactionaries against all ethnic groups in the country. Therefore, we must unite with all the people of Taiwan and, together with the people of the whole country, resolutely fight against the Kuomintang reactionary regime, which is supported by American imperialism, to achieve liberation. The February 28th Incident is a typical example of us and all the people of Taiwan uniting to fight against it.

The three major documents that the People's Political Consultative Conference is about to pass, especially the four articles on national policy in the Common Program, are not only completely agreed upon by us but are also more ideal and perfect than the goals we have long struggled for. Therefore, we not only generally support and support them but are also willing to fight to the end for the complete realization of this program, regardless of any sacrifice.

Finally, I would like to propose a hope. Because the life of the Gaoshan people is still very primitive and backward, the seven tribes have different languages, and none have their own script. Therefore, we request that the people of the whole country and the soon-to-be-established Central People's Government quickly liberate the people of Taiwan and, after liberation, actively help us develop political, economic, cultural, educational, and health construction according to the spirit of Article 53 of the program. Only then can true ethnic equality and great unity among all ethnic groups be truly realized.

In the future, we promise to work with the people of the whole country under the leadership of the People's Political Consultative Conference and the Central Government to contribute all our strength to build and consolidate an independent, democratic, peaceful, unified, prosperous, and friendly cooperative family— the People's Republic of China.

Celebrate the complete success of the People's Political Consultative Conference!

Long live the unity of the Chinese people and all ethnic groups!

Long live the People's Republic of China!

Long live Chairman Mao and General Zhu!

**Speech by Tianbao, Representative of Minority Nationalities**

Chairman, distinguished representatives:

I agree with the speech by the chief representative, Liu Geping. I fully support the three documents of the conference and hope that the conference will quickly pass them and spread them to the vast Tibetan people!

Now, the British and American imperialists, using their loyal lackey—Nehru—are further plotting to invade our Tibet, attempting to turn the Tibetan people into their slaves and horses.

The true freedom and liberation of the Tibetan people can only be achieved under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, with the help of the People's Liberation Army under the command of General Zhu, and with the close unity of all ethnic groups in China!

We warn these imperialist robbers! If you dare to make enemies of the 475 million people of all ethnic groups in China, you will definitely be punished by the great power of the Chinese people!

The Tibetan people in Qinghai and Gansu have already been liberated, and the entire Tibetan people will definitely be liberated in the near future!

Tibetan compatriots! Everyone, quickly rise up, cooperate with the People's Liberation Army, drive out the imperialists and their lackeys, and strive under the banner of Mao Zedong!

**Speech by Wang Shimin, Special Invited Representative**

Chairman, distinguished representatives:

I am one of the leaders of the Revolutionary Democratic Socialist Party. Three years ago, Zhang Junmai and his lackeys destroyed the old Political Consultative Conference and the democratic united front, shamelessly participated in the fake National Assembly, and participated in the fake government, becoming accomplices of Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary regime. The three years of civil war, Zhang Junmai is to bear a large part of the responsibility. The comrades in our party who are loyal to democracy and peace expressed great indignation and could not help but rise up against him and strike him. Therefore, the Revolutionary Democratic Socialist Party was organized. For the past three years, we have been fighting tirelessly to strike down Zhang Junmai and the reactionary regime of feudal bureaucrats colluding with American imperialism. Therefore, many comrades have been persecuted by the Kuomintang's special agents, imprisoned, tortured, and even sacrificed their lives. However, there are many shortcomings within us, such as an incomplete organization, complex members, and no strict discipline, often leading to erroneous speeches and actions, causing bad influences. I frankly admit these mistakes and sincerely accept criticism.

In the past, for striking down Zhang Junmai and the reactionary regime of feudal bureaucrats colluding with American imperialism, we had the necessity of organization and have fulfilled a part of the responsibility. Today, the situation is different. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the great leader Chairman Mao, the liberation of the whole country is not far away, and the people's revolution is about to achieve complete victory. The convening of this epoch-making People's Political Consultative Conference is the fruit of this great victory of the people's revolution. The three documents formulated at this conference—the Central People's Government Organization Law, the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Organization Law, and the Common Program—are the great charter of the Chinese people. From these three documents, we have drawn three conclusions: First, we have a unified leadership—that is, the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao; second, we have a unified line—that is, to implement people's democratic dictatorship in the country, with the working class as the leader and the worker-peasant alliance as the base, and to unite internationally with the people's democratic countries led by the Soviet Union to oppose the imperialist countries led by the United States; third, we have a unified goal—that is, to build new democratic politics, economy, and culture, and to achieve China's independence, democracy, peace, unity, and prosperity. With a unified leadership, a unified line, and a unified goal, our demands and wishes have been completely realized. Our party's organization and activities are no longer necessary. Therefore, we have decided to end our party's activities and dissolve our party's organization. Our comrades will join the Democratic Alliance due to historical relations, participate in new democratic youth organizations, or engage in study and work. We will work in different positions, accept unified leadership—the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, follow the unified line, and strive towards the unified goal.

Finally, I would like to say a few words to the distinguished representatives. We have participated in this great conference and have been inspired by the spirit of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and have heard many precious speeches and opinions. The conference is about to close. We should learn from the bees, make honey after collecting nectar, work hard for the people, and be busy for the people. We should learn from the silkworms, spin silk after eating, weave satin, and weave flowers, weave the flowers of new democracy, and weave the flowers of the complete victory of the people's revolution.

**Speech by Luo Longji, Representative of the China Democratic League**

Chairman, distinguished representatives:

The first plenary session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference will enter its most important and glorious stage today. The Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference will formally pass three sacred and dignified bills in Chinese history:

The Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Organization Law

The Central People's Government Organization Law of the People's Republic of China

The Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference

When we all stand up to unanimously pass these three bills, this will show what Chairman Mao Zedong said in his opening speech at the conference:

"One-fourth of the world's population has stood up!"

Now, the Chinese people stand up to declare to the world: these three bills, from today on, are the common charter, will, and action of the Chinese people!

Chairman Mao Zedong said in his opening speech at the conference: "Our work will be written in human history." Yes, in 1949, our work in this period will forever be written in human history. This is greater than the work of the British in 1215. That was just the day when the feudal lords rose up. This is greater than the work of the Americans on July 4, 1776, and the work of the French on July 14, 1789. That was just the day when the bourgeoisie rose up. Today, today is the day when the Chinese people overthrow the feudal forces and bureaucratic capitalism. This is the day when the broad masses of the Chinese people truly stand up and truly rise up!

Distinguished representatives! I would like to say a few more words about overthrowing imperialist aggression.

When we pass this great people's charter in the great capital of Beijing, I immediately think of the Lake Success in New York under the control of American imperialism, where a conference is also being held, that is, the United Nations General Assembly. Unfortunately, among the Chinese nationals in the United Nations General Assembly, there is a scoundrel named Jiang Tingfu, representing the reactionary remnants of China, representing the fake small court in Guangzhou, shamelessly shouting in Lake Success, begging for foreign aid, and trying to use the power of imperialism to obstruct and sabotage our revolutionary state-building cause!

I want to solemnly warn the United Nations General Assembly:

Chairman Chiang Kai-shek is today the public enemy of the Chinese people. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek is today the number one war criminal. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has rolled down from the fake president's seat and fled in disgrace. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek is a slave of American imperialism. Jiang Tingfu is a slave of Chiang Kai-shek. I want to quote a sentence from the Water Margin to tell the world: Jiang Tingfu is "a slave of a slave of a slave."

Today, the fake government in Nanjing has already collapsed. The United Nations General Assembly still allows such a scoundrel as Jiang Tingfu to make shameless shouts in the assembly. This is a mockery of the United Nations! This is a ridicule of the United Nations, and this is the greatest disgrace of the United Nations!

Here, we are not attacking the United Nations General Assembly. Our common charter's Common Program, Article 54, clearly states that the People's Republic of China supports lasting world peace. Therefore, we Chinese people naturally support the international organization that truly maintains lasting world peace. But we firmly oppose the imperialist aggression group led by American imperialism, manipulating and controlling the United Nations General Assembly, and opposing American imperialism turning the United Nations General Assembly into a tool for war mongers to destroy human peace and create world war!

The United Nations General Assembly is the fruit of the victory of the Second World War. The establishment of the United Nations General Assembly, the Chinese people have paid a heavy price. In the Chinese side, only the representatives of the Chinese people, only the representatives of the People's Republic of China, can enjoy the rights of representatives of the United Nations General Assembly. This right is our right of the People's Republic of China. Today, in the United Nations General Assembly in Lake Success, Jiang Tingfu represents Chiang Kai-shek, a person with the surname Chiang represents another person with the surname Chiang, and dares to occupy the seat of the representative in the United Nations General Assembly and make shameless shouts. He dares to call himself the representative of China and engage in slandering the state-building cause of the Chinese people. We Chinese people absolutely cannot allow such a fact to exist.

We Chinese people today solemnly declare to the United Nations General Assembly: under the current situation, before this scoundrel Jiang Tingfu is driven out of the assembly and before our legal representative of the People's Republic of China attends the assembly, any resolution of the United Nations General Assembly, we Chinese people cannot be bound by it. We Chinese people absolutely cannot recognize such a resolution having legal effect in China. Here, I want to loudly wake up the American imperialists, you should have a thorough awakening today! Over the years, I have repeatedly warned you, the Chiang Kai-shek regime and the Chinese people are irreconcilable, whoever aids Chiang Kai-shek is the enemy of the Chinese people, and whoever will suffer a serious blow and a tragic failure. Now, this thousand-page white paper is a record of your tragic failure and a good lesson for American imperialists. Today, I want to warn the American imperialist government, admit defeat! Give up your "using China to disturb China" policy thoroughly! The 475 million Chinese people who have stood up are more powerful than your thousands of atomic bombs. We have the strength to resist, strike, and smash any tricks and plots of American imperialism!

Our people's charter will be passed in its entirety! The Political Consultative Conference will announce the bright and upright foreign policy of the People's Republic of China to the world.

One-fourth of the world's population has stood up! We, the entire people, with one heart and one mind, united in sincerity, under the leadership of our wise leader Chairman Mao Zedong, will jointly strive to realize our foreign policy. Our policy is to support lasting world peace. At the same time, we firmly oppose war. We are even more determined to overthrow imperialist aggression!

**Speech by Liu Shanshen, Representative of the General Headquarters of the People's Liberation Army**

I represent all the people's air force and, with a heart full of excitement, celebrate the success of the People's Political Consultative Conference! We loyally support the "Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Organization Law," the "Central People's Government Organization Law of the People's Republic of China," and the "Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference." Under the leadership of the Central People's Government and the Military Commission of the People's Revolution, we will strive to implement these resolutions.

I initially applied to join the air force to resist Japan and save the country. However, after completing my studies in the United States and returning to the country, the Kuomintang reactionary regime drove us to fight a civil war, using foreign weapons to kill our own compatriots, which was completely contrary to our youth's will to save the country. Therefore, in June 1946, after seeing Chairman Mao's statement opposing American military aid to Chiang, I realized the conspiracy of American imperialism using Chiang Kai-shek as a tool to implement the plan to invade China. Therefore, I decided to rebel, risked my life to fly to Yan'an, and fought for China's independence and liberation under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. Now, the conspiracy of American imperialism to invade China has been completely exposed; the fact that Chiang Kai-shek sells out the country and becomes a lackey of American imperialism is known to everyone, and his days of annihilation are just around the corner. I want to warn all the air force personnel of the Kuomintang, if you do not want to be slaves of Chiang Kai-shek and slaves of American imperialism, you should immediately repent and join the People's Liberation Army. If you continue to assist the wicked and kill your fellow countrymen, the people of the whole country will not forgive you! The time for you to hesitate is very short, you must decide whether you want to perish with Chiang Kai-shek and be infamous forever, or surrender to the people's side, redeem your sins, and continue to serve the country and the people.

I am willing to serve the people's air force for life. I dare to assure the conference that I will work hard, overcome difficulties, and strive to build a powerful air force that serves the people, so that our air force can, together with our land and naval forces, form a powerful national defense force to defend our great motherland and prevent any imperialist from invading.

**Speech by Li Chenggan, Representative of the Freelance Professionals**

Chairman, distinguished representatives:

I am an engineer and am not good at speaking, and my speech is not clear, so I rarely speak in public. This time, I am fortunate to participate in the unprecedented national founding ceremony and feel excited, so I will share a few of my thoughts. If I say something wrong or if it is not clear, please forgive and correct me.

I have served various factories for more than thirty years and deeply feel that industry should benefit the masses, and I also deeply feel that industrial construction must rely on workers. Therefore, I have always advocated workers' education and have run workers' part-time supplementary education for more than twenty years and have also run technical schools for eight or nine years, always wanting to cultivate and improve workers' knowledge and skills so that they can take on the responsibility of industrial construction.

The People's Republic of China, with the working class as the leader, is extremely reasonable and appropriate. In the future, we engineers should actively, enthusiastically, and practically teach workers practical knowledge and skills to enhance their leadership, especially to improve their political awareness so that they understand their responsibilities and play a leading role. Only then can industry develop reasonably and rapidly. Even we engineers often do not care about politics, do not understand politics, and do not like to talk about politics, sometimes inadvertently making mistakes in the direction of work. I am also one who does not like politics, and in the future, I must also pay attention to political awareness so as not to work in vain or cause harm.

Now, the People's Government of the People's Republic of China has been established, and the administrative program has been formulated. We engineers will not have to worry about finding suitable workplaces in the future, as long as we serve the people. The next step is to see how to do it.

China is backward in everything, and industry is even more backward. We have limited manpower, financial resources, and materials, and it is not easy to build up in the shortest time. Therefore, whether it is public or private, whether it is state-owned or private enterprises, all should be under the unified national plan, based on the policy indicated by Chairman Mao: "balancing public and private interests, benefiting labor and capital, assisting cities and countryside, and exchanging domestic and foreign," for the goal of developing production and prospering the economy, and do it step by step and practically, there is hope. That is to say: things that can be delayed, even if there is profit, should not be done; things that can be saved, even if it is easy to do, should not be done. What kind of business should be done in what place, how many kinds of goods should be produced, what should be done in what way, what should be merged, and what should be done even if there is no profit, should be subsidized and encouraged, and even what kind of person should do what kind of work, all should be regulated by the state according to the situation. That is to say, national construction should be specialized, divided by industry, standardized, and rationally supplied and demanded, and the profits and losses should be calculated as a whole. For example, the most important thing in current construction is transportation and power. Even if these two items spend a lot and have losses, the indirectly arising industries will be many, and the benefits obtained by the state, calculated as a whole, will be very great. Again, people must eat and wear, and it is better to find work for them to do than to just eat and wear without doing anything, which will at least produce a little and help production, so the focus and steps of national construction should not be ignored, for overall planning.

In addition to planning and stepping economically to build, all the people of the country should wholeheartedly and do their best. Now, with the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, all the people of the country should be awakened and vigilant, and everyone should work hard together. I think the minimum condition that everyone should keep in mind is:

First, everyone should save clothes and food, advocate frugality and diligence, and never waste or fake.

Second, everyone should use domestic goods as much as possible, not use luxury goods, and everything that can be exported should be saved and produced more to exchange for foreign exchange for construction needs.

Third, treat public affairs and public property as private affairs and private property, and treat private affairs and private property as public affairs and public property. In fact, the ultimate goal of nationalization and the ultimate goal of life is that there is no distinction between public and private.

Fourth, eliminate feudal thoughts, sectarianism, localism, territorialism, selfishness, individualism, leadership desires, and controlling desires, and all kinds of narrow-minded and selfish thoughts, and only seek what is beneficial to the state and the people, and do not care about personal interests.

The above are my temporary thoughts and opinions. At this time when industrial construction is about to take its first steps forward, I would like to contribute this and wish the new China a quick success in construction!

**Speech by Yang Zhenmin, Representative of the Northwest Liberation Area**

Chairman, distinguished representatives:

The epoch-making Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference has been opened. The unprecedented unity of the Chinese people and all ethnic groups within China has reached its highest level in history because now it is the people who are in power.

The three major documents that have been thoroughly discussed in the conference, especially the Common Program, are the crystallization of the development of modern Chinese revolution and a beautiful blueprint for the construction of a new democratic China. The birth of New China will make the Chinese people stand up in the world for the first time.

For nearly a hundred years, countless revolutionary martyrs and patriots have fought bravely and risen again and again, sacrificing countless lives and blood and sweat, but have not achieved their wishes. Today, their wishes have been realized, so we cannot help but thank the advanced political party of the Chinese working class—the Communist Party and the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, for their correct leadership.

However, today, there are still many revolutionary pioneers and patriots who, for opposing the traitor Chiang Kai-shek, have lost their freedom and are imprisoned. For example, General Zhang Xueliang, who led the Xi'an Incident in 1936 to oppose Chiang Kai-shek's treacherous "extermination of the Communists" policy, and my father, General Yang Huicheng, have been imprisoned by Chiang Kai-shek for thirteen years and are still living in prison. Although they cannot see our revolutionary victory with their own eyes and may even be killed at any time, I believe that when they are still alive, as long as they hear the news of the opening of the Political Consultative Conference and the imminent birth of New China, they will be deeply comforted in their hearts; because their sacrifices, sufferings, and wishes have truly been realized today.

Today's history once again proves that the Kuomintang reactionary regime, with any means of massacre, imprisonment, and special agents, cannot stop the tide of people's revolution, and in the face of people's revolution and people's liberation war, this small group of scum of the Chinese nation will soon be reduced to powder and thrown into the garbage dump of history.

I promise in front of Chairman Mao, General Zhu, and the conference that I will turn my hatred for the enemy into revolutionary strength, be more determined in my revolutionary will, and firmly stand in my position to carry out all orders of the Central People's Government and the People's Liberation Army and the resolutions of the People's Political Consultative Conference to build an independent, free, peaceful, unified, and prosperous New China to the end.

Long live the People's Republic of China!

Long live the Chinese Communist Party!

Long live Chairman Mao and General Zhu!

**Speech by Zhang Xuesi, Representative of the General Headquarters of the People's Liberation Army**

Chairman, distinguished representatives:

The convening of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference is an announcement of the demise of Old China and the birth of New China. It signifies the victory of the Chinese people's liberation war, the victory of the great unity of the Chinese people, and the victory of Chairman Mao's thought.

For more than a hundred years, the Chinese people and all patriots have fought bravely and selflessly for the rebirth of China. Some have already sacrificed their lives, and some are still being detained by the remaining reactionary forces, such as Generals Zhang Xueliang and Yang Huicheng, who have been imprisoned by Chiang Kai-shek for thirteen years and are still living in prison. Although they cannot see the birth of New China or personally participate in this grand event, they have now obtained the greatest comfort. The three drafts proposed by the Preparatory Committee have solved China's urgent problems. They are the current great charter of the Chinese people, and the Chinese people have entered a new era of people's democracy. The Chinese people have stood up. I, on behalf of the Chinese People's Navy, express to the conference that we fully agree with these three historical documents and are willing to strive for their thorough implementation.

The Chinese People's Navy, with the status of a youngster, is listed in the ranks of the great Chinese People's Liberation Army. Due to the development of the people's liberation war and the uprising of patriotic personnel in the Kuomintang Navy, not only has the enemy's navy been disintegrated, but the Chinese People's Navy has also been rapidly strengthened.

In the future, we will definitely implement all the requirements of the Common Program regarding the military system, making the navy a part of the unified people's army, and based on the principles of unity between officers and soldiers and unity between the military and the people, establish a political work system, learn from and carry forward the fine traditions of the People's Liberation Army, educate our naval officers and soldiers with revolutionary spirit and patriotism, improve the political quality and military technology of all personnel, and cultivate the cadres of the people's navy in an orderly manner. We will definitely implement the call of Chairman Mao and General Zhu in actual actions and strive to build a powerful Chinese People's Navy.

We will use our greatest efforts to quickly strengthen our combat readiness and, under the command of the Central People's Government and the Revolutionary Military Commission, cooperate with the People's Air Force and assist the powerful People's Land Army to liberate the Zhoushan Islands, Hainan Island, and Taiwan, thoroughly smash the conspiracy of American imperialism to seize Taiwan, eliminate the remaining forces of the imperialist lackey Chiang Kai-shek and all reactionaries, and carry out the people's liberation war to the end, defend the territorial waters of the Chinese people, and consolidate national defense.

Congratulations on the successful Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference!

Long live the People's Republic of China!

Long live Chairman Mao and General Zhu!

**Speech by Liu Qingyang, Representative of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation**

Chairman, distinguished representatives:

In this unprecedented and unprecedentedly united People's Political Consultative Conference, I have had limitless thoughts. In the precious opinions expressed by Chairman Mao, General Zhu, Vice Chairman Zhou, and various representatives, not only have I had the opportunity to learn, but I have also had many reflections and warnings.

Due to the great victory of the people's liberation war, we have today's fruits of the Political Consultative Conference. Here, I first think of the unyielding and unyielding fighting spirit of countless martyrs who have sacrificed their lives over the past thirty years. During the mourning at the beginning of the conference, I could not control my tears, but today, all the martyrs have been comforted. Among the female comrades, there are the martyrs Xiong Ying, Huang Li, and Guo Longzhen, as well as many male and female heroes who have sacrificed their lives in the anti-Japanese war, fighting bravely and selflessly. Their calm and greatness in facing death will forever be unforgettable. I hope that after the establishment of the Central People's Government, the heroic deeds of struggle of these martyrs will be praised early.

Secondly, I think that the far-sighted and magnanimous policy of the Chinese Communist Party is very successful! From the convening of the Beijing Municipal Representatives Conference to this Political Consultative Conference, it has fully demonstrated the spirit of democracy. Such a magnanimous embrace of people from all walks of life who pursue progress can be said to be enough to make people sincerely moved and reflect on their own inadequacies and feel ashamed. Therefore, it cannot but make progressive people sincerely serve and be willing to struggle under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao to achieve the success of the three national construction documents.

Third, our conference has carefully discussed the three drafts of national construction documents before and during the conference, and has discussed many times in groups or collectively after collecting ideas. After careful discussion, we proposed it to the conference. During the discussion, I often made the mistake of impatience, thinking that unnecessary words do not need to be said. However, the comrades responsible for leading the discussion always patiently gave everyone the opportunity to speak without reservation. This obvious fact has already surpassed eloquence. This is enough to refute the rumors spread by the reactionaries that the Communist Party does not give people freedom.

This unprecedented national founding ceremony, as Li Xiuzhen said, is indeed the result of the blood and sweat of the masses. Therefore, every representative attending the conference must sincerely serve the people with practical actions in the future and carry the revolution to the end, with a firm belief, strive to build an invincible People's Republic of China, and completely eliminate imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism!

Long live the People's Republic of China!

Long live the great Chairman Mao!

Long live General Zhu!

　　中国人民政治协商会议第一届全体会议
  　各单位代表主要发言
    中国国民党革命委员会代表
    李任仁　发言
    主席、各位代表先生：
    本人是从待解放区域的广西，经过了许多转折，想了许多方法，并承中共的友人帮助才能到达人民首都的北京的。今天能有机会参加新中国开国第一次的盛会，不只是个人的荣幸，而且是待解放的广西一千五百万人民的莫大欣慰。这几天来听了毛主席的开会词和各位先生的讲话，关于这次人民政协会议的重大意义和即将由会议通过的人民政协组织法，人民政协共同纲领，中央人民政府组织法三大法案，就理论上，就实际上，就需要上，就效用上，都是经过详尽的发挥了。我们只有心悦诚服地赞同，无条件地拥护！
    本人现在打算报告一点关于广西的材料，请各位先生参考。在过去广西博得一点虚誉，就是被一般人称为基层有组织，民众有训练，军队能作战，李宗仁和白崇禧就凭借这一点资本，和美帝国主义勾结，企图取得美帝援助，一方面对蒋匪要挟诈索饷械；另一方面要想和中共分庭抗礼，谋个人的权利。李白明知道自己的力量难敌解放大军，不能在外久驻，就梦想撤回广西作负隅的抵抗。同时对干部及民众宣传：“广西接近安南，西通滇黔，东出钦廉，地形险阻，能守若干时日，美援必至；第三次世界大战也快爆发，届时就有转机；倘若你们附和中共，家庭必被拆散，生活全无自由”。但这种欺骗的宣传，无耻的幻想，人民和许多干部都清楚认识，李白无非想利用他们来作殉葬品罢了。试看广西各县的人民，不断地反抗李白的征兵征实，不断的破坏李白军运的路线；而起来组织武装进行解放的区域，有五六十县之多，占了全省的半数以上。单是青年学生，参加在内的就有两万多人。我离开广西的时候，有许多人民对我说：我们迫切地企望解放大军快快到来，我们早已准备欢迎了！你若有方法遇得到人民的领袖毛主席，人民解放军朱总司令，务须把我们所受压迫的痛苦情形，把我们切望解放大军到来的热烈心情，向他们报告。我相信，不只广西一省的老百姓这样，其他待解放区的老百姓也是这样的。这就恰象古书上所说：“奚我后后来其苏”的意味。仅仅从这一点来看，就知道日暮途穷的李白，很快就归于灭亡。一向和李白久共患难的朋友，都和他们割席绝交，象这样的众叛亲离，不亡何待！前两天人民解放军的将领们提出一定迅速地解放广西和其他未解放地方的保证；我现在也向全会提出保证，广西人民一定是站在解放军这一面的，也一定是在毛主席领导下努力迈进的。
    现在人民政协会议已经成功，中央人民政府即将成立，全国人民知道新的政府是自己的政府，自然竭诚拥护；国家的事业就是自己的事业，自然尽心去做。有此人民大众作基础，又有英明伟大的人民领袖毛主席作导师，新中国的建设前途定有长足的进步，无限的光明！
    新疆代表
    阿里木江　发言
    各位代表同志：
    中国人民在中共的领导下，摆脱了接连不断的流血悲剧，而走向了真正和平民主的生活大道，从此任何一种反动势力再也不能欺侮中国人民了。飘扬在全中国国土上的解放旗帜，加强了亚洲殖民地半殖民地人民争取反对帝国主义统治者的民族解放运动的胜利的信心，具有伟大历史意义的中国人民的胜利，吸引着全世界广大人群的注意。
    我新疆人民除一致拥护大会通过的三大历史文件外，并保证和全国人民站在一起，共同完成这一伟大的历史任务。
    几世纪以来，就为争取自由解放而斗争的新疆人民，一致拥护这次政协所制定的共同纲领内的民族政策，并促其实现。我们坚决相信在中国共产党和毛主席领导下，一定能够依据马克思、列宁主义的原则来彻底解决我们的民族问题。
    我们保证新疆人民必将坚决实行政协的一切决议，一致响应毛主席的一切号召。
    在马克思、列宁旗帜下，胜利前进！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    伟大人民领袖毛泽东主席万岁！
    华北解放区代表
    蓝公武　发言
    主席团、诸位代表：
    本单位的意见，已由薄一波首席代表陈述过了，我个人现在只说一点感想。
    过去常听到许多人说：“中国人如一盘散沙，不能团结”。不错，在满清政府、北洋军阀、蒋介石反动派统治时代，人民所见到的只有卖国殃民，贪污腐化，所受到的只有压迫榨取，屠杀囚禁，人民当然不会有团结，也不可能有团结。今天在中国共产党和毛主席领导之下，情形便大不相同。共产党是依靠人民大众的力量来进行革命事业的。在解放了的地方，人民都团结起来，组织起来，成为一个伟大的革命力量。过去打败日寇，打败蒋介石反动派，都是这种团结的力量。在今天的人民会议中，凡是过去所看作不能调和的各党派各阶级，都已经团结起来，成为建设新中国的一个伟大力量。并且制定了长久存在的形式——人民政协会议组织法。我们在这里确是认识了一个伟大真理。
    过去又常听到许多人说“民主政治不适用于中国”。不错，在辛亥革命以后，曾一度行过的议会政治，确是模仿欧美，成绩不好，以致丧失了人民的同情。但这是不是由于民主政治不适用于中国？不是，这是由于我们所模仿的旧民主乃是一个少数资产阶级专政的政治制度，根本不是人民大众的民主制度。又因少数资产阶级中各派别各个人利害不同，彼此嫉视，因而所制定的制度把国家政权分割，成互相对立，互相钳制的若干权力机关。这种制度只是为少数人谋利益，不能为人民大众服务，只能为争权夺利的工具，不能为推行政策的机构。美国有名的政治格言所谓“阻挠与平衡”，真是言符其实。不过所阻挠的是国利民福的政策，所平衡的是政客官僚的私利。至于新民主主义是人民民主，政府由人民所产生，为人民所拥护，人民的力量，便是政府的力量，政府有力量推行政策，人民有力量监督政府，根本和旧民主不同。诸位代表对于新民主主义比我知道得多，我不再多说。
    我虽然年岁已在六十以上，然而我不服老，我一定要努力学习，努力工作，为建设新中国而奋斗。
    中国人民解放军第一野战军代表
    赵寿山　发言
    主席、各位代表先生：
    中国人民政治协商会议的召开，这标志着我们伟大的中国永远脱离了半封建，半殖民地的命运，在国家历史上是一个转折点，是一个新纪元。我能参加这个盛会，除感觉有无限的兴奋和愉快；我将以满腔热忱，站在军事岗位上，竭诚拥护会议的一切精神和执行会议的一切决议。
    这次大会提出的三个文件，是目前时期人民大团结的最好的统一战线的组织形式，和最适切的行动纲领，我一定为它的全部实现而奋斗到底。
    我曾当过蒋介石反动政府的高级军官，但是我早在十余年以前，就不止一次的感觉到他的背叛革命，独裁卖国，只顾少数人利益，不管民生痛苦。所以我在双十二事变中，就毅然决然的促成和参加。抗战起后，我率部守卫中条山两年半，黄河铁桥两年另七个月，我的主张是团结进步，一致抗日，因此蒋介石说我是共产党的应声虫，我受过蒋介石的八次反动训练，进步的朋友们讽刺我，说我是个受训专家。蒋介石说我越训越坏。的确在蒋介石的眼中越训越坏。因为我看他真是“好话说完，坏事做尽”，口里讲的和平，暗地里发给军队的却是剿匪手本；一方面开的政协会议，一方面又开的剿匪会议；象这样言不顾行的翻云覆雨，使我们在战场上牺牲的军人，怎能不寒心，怎能不愤恨！但是，幸运的在八年抗战中我的防地，却先后与八路军毗连或接近，并且曾受过朱彭总副司令的指挥，因而看见了人民军队的纪律优良，作战的勇敢、顽强，使我脑筋中有深刻印象的，开始了向共产党向八路军学习的热诚，因而才下最大决心，冒万险千辛，投奔解放区，在毛主席朱总司令的领导下当一个虔诚学习的小学生。
    我是个旧的军人，脑子里旧的东西不时在反映，希望先进的先生们常为指正，也希望同我一样的朋友，一道来改造自己。我们要学习马列主义、毛泽东思想，把我们个人过去不好的思想、习惯、态度、作风逐渐改掉，把我们的官兵关系、军民关系搞好，齐头并进的来完成解放全中国的大业，并使中国人民政协大会交给我们的一切任务，得以迅速的实施。
    郭沫若先生在前天会议上所讲的：“美帝国主义这只纸老虎已经戳穿了，我们今后还要继续地戳，戳得他遍体鳞伤不成形状”。郭先生是世界闻名的大文豪，他用笔来戳，并且号召全国的文艺工作者，一起来戳。我们革命军人为了保卫世界和平一定也得准备好各种武器，上好刺刀，更要狠狠的戳他个“破烂不堪，狼籍满地”，最后并用一把火把它烧掉！
    让我们高呼：
    中国人民政治协商会议万岁！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    毛主席万岁！
    朱总司令万岁！
    中国国民党革命委员会代表
    李锡九　发言
    主席团和各位代表先生：
    我今天在这个表现中国人民空前大团结并具有伟大的历史意义的盛会上发言，真感到十分愉快，十分荣幸！
    本会主要的任务，是通过人民政协组织法，人民政协共同纲领和中央人民政府组织法三个历史性文件。诚如前三天各位发言代表所一致指出，这三个文件，是中国人民建设自己国家的蓝图。它适切地反映了全国人民迫切的要求，也照顾到各民主阶级，国内各少数民族和国外华侨的利益。全国人民对它不仅衷心赞同与拥护，并且愿在即将由大会产生的中华人民共和国中央人民政府和中国共产党毛主席领导下，为它的彻底实现而共同努力。
    中国人民为解除帝国主义、封建主义的束缚，建立人民自己的民主国家，奋斗已历百余年，我党创始者孙中山先生的革命理想三民主义，便是早年在这个奋斗的过程中提出来的。孙先生曾贡献其一生于中国人民革命事业，他的革命理想也与时代以俱进，不断地发展和改进其内容，在今天旧三民主义已成为过去的东西，而革命的三民主义亦须更进一步向前发展，新的三民主义应与新民主主义同其内容，真正能体会中山先生的革命精神的人，绝对不应“故步自封”，必须坚决地奋勇前进，赶上时代。
    从今天起中国人民的革命事业，踏上了新的阶段，中国人民已以自己的力量，彻底推翻了敌人的反动统治，获得基本上的胜利，我们从此开始建设我们自己国家的新工作，只要我们全国人民贡献其一切智能共同努力，一个符合人民愿望的新中国，必能很快的建设起来。在这里我想就华北人民的愿望和责任说几句话。华北人民在近百年来，几度受帝国主义武装侵略铁蹄的践踏，封建军阀的长期蹂躏，国民党反动派统治的无餍榨取，因之华北人民对于自己国家建立的期望最为迫切。所以在八年抗日战争和三年人民解放战争中，华北人民在中国共产党的领导之下站起来了，首先推翻了帝国主义和国民党的反动统治，并忍受很大的负担支援前线，使人民解放战争终于获得全国规模的胜利。今后摆在新中国人民面前的主要课题，即变落后的农业国为现代化工业国的新民主主义经济建设，华北得天独厚，拥有很多的重工业的资源和生产工业原料的广大农村，在即将开展的经济建设中，华北人民将要负起极主要的责任。华北大部分是老解放区，各地早在中国共产党领导下坚定的完成了土地改革，我相信，他们一定也能够发挥极大的决心，在新民主主义经济建设中，担负起主干的责任。
    最后让我们高呼：
    中国人民政治协商会议成功万岁！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    朱总司令万岁！
    中国人民领袖毛主席万岁！
    人民解放军第四野战军代表
    张轸　发言
    主席，各位代表先生：
    中国人民政治协商会议的召开，就是中国人民伟大集中的表现，我是新改编部队的一个军人，在这里来发表我的意见，是十分的愉快，又十分感奋。
    蒋介石以流氓的手段，假三民主义之名，而作反三民主义之实，早为全国人心所厌弃。特别是在八年抗日战争之后，全国精疲力竭，谁都渴望和平，休养生息，独有蒋介石，不顾名义，破坏政协，发动大规模的内战，那时我也曾经参加了，当刘伯承将军渡河南下的时候，我以武汉行辕副主任的身分，指挥强大兵团，阻止刘伯承将军在大别山的发展，这是我随着蒋白二匪，作反革命反人民的罪恶，使我内心无限的痛苦。
    不过那时我前后虽然指挥了十四个整编师，而我实际是赤手空拳，连一个营甚至一个连的基本力量也没有。直到去年九月，我当了河南省政府主席。才开始组织部队，先后成立五个省保安旅，四个绥靖旅，一面扩编整理，一面鼓动白崇禧作反蒋联共运动，商谈两个月之久，由于我对白认识不足，而白崇禧的反蒋，实际上是以李宗仁为名的取而代之，来实现他的借美援、反革命的阴谋，虽然派人向中共接头，也不过是缓兵之计，这是李任仁、黄绍＠、刘斐诸先生，曾参加内幕，所都知道的，我两次亲赴长沙，向程潜将军商讨大计，都为白崇禧看破，所以在武汉解放的前三天，白崇禧把我贺胜桥的司令部包围，叫我到武汉开会，险被扣留，我不得已只身潜赴金口，走向人民阵线。
    起义以后，只剩下两万多破烂部队，都是封建集团，甚至有反革命分子，在很快的时间，蒙毛主席朱总司令的宽大，发表为正规的人民解放军第五十一军的番号，这对我们是太大荣誉了。在武汉时，又蒙四野和十二兵团各级首长，很诚恳的、坦白的、热情的、特别照顾，并派各级政工人员，帮助教育，来改造我们部队的思想和行动，使我们获得新生。讲到这里，我不能不深受毛主席伟大精神的感召，我不能不深佩毛泽东思想的伟大成功。
    现在人民政治协商会议召开了，我以无限的热忱，拥护大会所决议的三个伟大文献。今后我愿在毛主席领导下，学习共产党一切优良的作风，来改造我自己的思想。我愿在朱总司令的指挥下，学习人民解放军一切的完美制度，来洗尽部队的恶习。我愿以全力帮助河南地方政府，肃清土匪恶霸，并愿追随先进的解放军之后，把蒋介石匪帮残余力量，完全消灭，把美帝国主义侵略迷梦，彻底粉碎，谋得中国的永久和平。
    中国人民政治协商会议万岁！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    毛主席朱总司令万岁！
  　无党派民主人士代表
    李达　发言
    我站在社会科学工作者的立场，说几句话。
    在本会议所拟订的三大文件之中，我认为共同纲领是最基本的文件，政协组织法和政府组织法，实际上是根据这个纲领写成的，我们可以说，共同纲领，是中华人民共和国的根本大法。
    其次，这个纲领，综合了将近一百年的中国革命的历史的经验，主要的是根据毛泽东的“新民主主义论”、“论联合政府”、“论人民民主专政”及其他许多著作，拟订出来的。我们可以说，这个纲领，是毛泽东思想的具体的表现。
    再次，这个纲领草案，在筹备会的期间，经过了小组和常委会多次的讨论和修正，经过了全体代表两次分组的讨论和补充。在这次正式会议中，自从毛主席致了开幕词以后，有各单位七十多名代表的讲话和发言，都一致拥护这个纲领，并愿为它的实现而奋斗。我们可以说，这个纲领，是代表着全国四亿七千万以上人民的共同意志，普遍意志，是中国人民民主的大宪章。
    所以，从社会科学的角度来看，共同纲领，是中国新民主主义时代的理论与实际结合的马列主义教科书。我主张即将成立的新政府教育部，要把共同纲领规定为大学各院系的公共必修科，为各级中学的必修科，并且要深入浅出的编纂一本小册子，作为小学的教本。
    同时，我们社会科学工作者，站在马列主义的立场，要认定这共同纲领只是新民主主义的政治纲领，在将来，还有社会主义的政治纲领来代替它。新民主主义时代，是从半封建半殖民地社会到社会主义社会的过渡期，这是中国社会发展必经的阶段。我们研究和宣传这共同纲领的时候，必须注视到社会主义的目标。例如，本纲领第四章经济政策中，列举着五种经济的范畴，并提出了“公私兼顾”的原则。但从新民主主义的精神来说，国营企业那种社会主义性质的经济，是优先于其他四种经济的。随着新民主主义经济的发展，社会主义性质的经济，将逐渐发展起来，将逐渐克服资本主义经济。这是必然的。又如，本纲领第五条，规定人民有思想自由。这是意味着：马列主义思想与非马列主义思想，同样是自由的。但在以工人阶级为领导的人民民主政权之下，马列主义思想领导着非马列主义思想。随着新民主主义社会的发展，马列主义思想将完全扬弃非马列主义思想。这也是必然的。在新民主主义时代，和平的阶级斗争（经济的、政治的、思想的），仍然是继续下去的。所以，当我们从事于新哲学、新史学、新经济学、新政治学、新法学等的研究或著作时，一面要注重阐扬这个共同纲领的旨趣，同时，我们的思想和笔锋，要指向着社会主义，对于广大的读者和工作者，指示社会主义的方向。只有这样，才能正确的宣传毛泽东思想，提高社会科学的水平。
    特别邀请代表
    林遵　发言
    主席，各位代表，各位来宾：
    本人能够参加这个大会，觉得非常光荣，对于大会的共同纲领，政协组织法，中央人民政府组织法，三个草案，曾经参加多次的共同研究，认为这确是全中国人民意志的总表现，表示彻底的拥护。
    我是一个海军军人，想起过去中国海军从前清时代一直到蒋介石反动派时代，都是被利用着作为反革命与反人民的工具。因此海军人员在过去长时期中，是被压迫的，是被奴役的，是被封锁的。反动派不给你研究社会科学的理论，不给你谈政治问题，也不给你同社会发生关系。海军人员虽具有纯洁的思想，专门的技能，志愿为建设一个保卫海疆抵御外侮的海军而努力，但是反动派却不要你这样做。他们不是克扣海军经费，使得海军毫无办法，就是要你做他特殊集团的奴隶，做他反革命反人民的武器，什么捍卫国家，什么保护人民利益，他们都全不管，所以近百年来，中国海军是无法建立的。
    但是革命的潮流是拦阻不住的，被压迫的海军人们，也有他的革命历史。如辛亥革命时代，黄钟英等率海筹等舰在武汉起义；二次革命时代，程璧等率海圻等舰参加广州革命政府；北伐时代，郭寿生等率建威等舰参加上海人民大暴动。本次解放战争中，这种事实更多了，如本年二月间的黄安军舰起义，邓兆祥的重庆军舰起义，四月间的第二舰队各舰各艇队的起义，以及最近长治军舰的起义。此外还有起义未成功的，参加地下工作的，及许多不愿意再替反动派服务冒险投奔人民阵线来的。这都是证明觉悟的海军军人，一有机会，是会跟着革命潮流走的。
    我们海军同仁今后的目标：第一要协同我们的陆军和空军，继续进行解放战争，彻底消灭反动派，完全解放台湾、澎湖和海南岛；第二要努力建立一个保卫中国领土主权之独立与完整的海军。这二种目标就是政协的共同纲领所指示给我们的，也就是我们目前和历来所期望的。我们相信在全国人民支援之下，在毛主席朱总司令领导之下，我们一定能够早日达成这些任务的。我们呼唤着：被压迫在反动派下的海军官兵，赶快觉悟起来，举起你们的义旗，跑到人民队伍里边来，这才是你们的前途！
    中国人民政治协商会议万岁！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    毛主席朱总司令万岁！

    各位代表先生：
    中国人民政治协商会议几天的讨论中，各方面的代表都一致热烈地拥护大会的三大文件，这就是充分地证明中国共产党和中国人民领袖毛主席领导的正确。我相信全国的工人、学生、妇女、青年以及广大群众：一定会执行大会所制定的一切决议，实现我们的共同纲领，向建设独立、民主、和平、统一、富强的新中国的路上前进。
    我是一个青年女工，生在贫苦的农民家庭，由于中国广大农村，在帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义的压榨下破产了，我没有办法在乡下生活，被迫到上海去，才十二岁，就不得不到工厂去做养成工。十七年来，我先后在英国怡和纱厂、日本内外棉纱厂、国民党官僚资本的中纺一厂做工，象牛马一样，过着挨饿受冻的生活。在那整整十七年的很长的岁月里，受尽了各种各样的奴役压迫，苦难是说不完的。可是我并没有屈服，尤其是当我得到中国共产党的领导之后，我认清了前途，我参加了抗日救亡运动，以及工厂内外的各种斗争，反对帝国主义，官僚资本主义对中国工人阶级的压榨与进攻。虽然我们遭受着各种残暴的镇压，被捕坐牢，但并没有把我吓倒。当时我们坚信，反动派总要有一天完蛋，光明一定要到来。果然，上海解放了，全上海的人民一起见到太阳了。
    现在中国人民政治协商会议宣告旧中国的死亡，新中国诞生了，再也没有对工人的奴役，对青年的迫害，对妇女的侮辱与束缚了。今天我——一个年青的女工，能够站在中国人民政治协商会议的讲台上来说话，这是五千年来中国历史上没有的事，我感到无上光荣！这是中国工人的光荣！中国妇女的光荣！中国青年的光荣！中国人民的光荣！
    中国工人阶级在今天受到无比的尊重，成为国家的主人，这是无数先烈的流血牺牲换来的，我们也就感到今天责任的重大。我们必须用一切努力克服建设中的种种困难，必须粉碎帝国主义及反动残余的阴谋破坏，保卫我们的祖国，虽然在前进的路上有这些困难，可是我们有了共产党，有了毛主席，在他的领导之下，我们就一定能够克服一切困难，能够战胜一切敌人，赢得更美好的将来！

    主席，诸位代表先生：
    我和重庆舰起义的官兵以及灵甫舰继续参加的官兵，在东北人民解放军海军学校受训，学习，并受人民和政府的优待，今天又得参加中国人民政治协商会议，感到荣幸，更感到无限兴奋！对于大会讨论的三个建国大宪章，我敢保证海军学校全体一定遵照朱总司令前天在大会的指示，切实去执行。
    我感觉几十年来，中国受尽帝国主义的侵略、压迫，主要的原因，是为没有海防。为什么我们不能建设海防呢？是因为从满清皇朝直至战犯蒋介石专政时代都是勾结帝国主义者来压迫和剥削人民大众，所以不愿意中国有保护人民利益的武力，建设海军，就因此绝望。
    现在人民革命胜利了，中央人民政府就要宣告成立。共同纲领的规定和毛主席的指示，都要建设中国的海军。因此，我们知道在革命胜利之后，建设海军是绝对的必要。但是在建设新海军的初期，必须有一个建设新海军的运动。我们要扩大海军建设的宣传，使全国民众和海外侨胞，都能认识海军建设的重要，一致拥护今后政府对于海军建设的计划，这样，经过一个相当时期以后，一定能够建设一个强大的海军。最后我们谨以最大的热诚，庆祝大会的成功！
　　国内少数民族代表
    张冲　发言
    主席，各位代表：
    本席是少数民族彝族代表。我们彝族一向受压迫，受歧视，人们叫我们做蛮子、猓猡，不当做人看待。但是，今天我们做了人，并且做了国家的主人，来参加这个中国历史上没有先例的大会，实在是无比的光荣与兴奋。
    关于少数民族共同的意见，已由本单位首席代表刘格平同志报告过了，我不再重复。对于筹委会起草的三大文件，我认为是中华人民的大宪章，也是我们各民族共同的大宪章，我们坚决拥护，愿为其全部实现而奋斗到底。
    我所代表的彝族，多半居住在云南。邻省的广西、贵州、四川、西藏、西康，以及邻国的暹逻、缅甸、安南，都有着我们的血缘兄弟，我们原是住在横断山脉的平原中，但，那些肥美的土地，早为大汉族主义的统治者霸占去了，可是那里的汉族的劳动阶级兄弟们，却不曾为了土地的肥美而减轻了他们的苦痛，他们也和我们少数民族劳动阶级同受汉族统治阶级残酷的压榨。
    我们在高山峻岭，丛林深谷不断地向自然界的野兽斗争，也向人间的野兽斗争。横断山脉里有的是矿山瀑布，可成为民族富强的资源。现在，数百万人民解放军正向边疆推进，我们的族人和各兄弟民族，在共产党领导下，已在各地区建立了自己的武装，正在准备迎接人民解放军大军的到临。
    为了保证永久的解放，我们必须执行共同纲领的民族政策，坚决反对少数民族内部的人民公敌。我们彝族以前有过人民的英雄，但也有过民族的败类，云南伪主席卢汉就是败类。一九四五年他出卖了龙云，出卖了云南，出卖了八万滇军健儿，送到冰天雪地的东北，替蒋匪作反人民战争的炮灰，换取了他云南奴隶总管的地位，使蒋匪能完成战争的准备，同时解去后顾之忧，进攻解放区。四年来在云南一连串地发生的惨案，如一二一惨案；李闻惨案，七一五惨案，卢汉都有责任的。半年前在昆明中央银行屠杀人民二十多人也是卢汉的罪行。
    最近，由于革命胜利的发展，蒋朝的覆亡指日可期，卢汉恐慌了，既与蒋贼勾搭，又伪装开明，杨杰将军迟迟离滇与此不无关系，本月初，在所谓昆明事变中，他又一次地出卖了人民，封闭报馆，解散反蒋的省参议会，解散大学、中学、逮捕民主人士，杨杰将军就在这一突变中，不能不离开昆明，到香港后就遭了特务的毒手。有人说，卢汉的处境困难，但困难是有限度的，如果他能做出象北平、长沙、绥远那样的范例，在毛主席的宽大政策下，一定可以得到宽恕的，否则，他只有自趋灭亡。他以为云南远居山国，并且与帝国主义殖民地邻近，其实，我们的族人，早已认识他的面目，数万的滇军健儿，已经觉悟起来，正要回去解放家乡，纵有天涯海角，他又如何能逃脱？
    弱小民族的解放事业是与全中国人民的解放事业联结在一起的，伟大的马、恩、列、斯及毛主席的民族理论，指示我们正确的道路。
    弱小民族只有在中国共产党领导下，才能获得彻底的解放。今天，敌人还在挣扎，还在不断地进行阴谋，破坏团结，挑拨弟兄民族的情感，这是我们首先要警惕的。因此，我们必须在中共领导下，团结成坚固的阵线，反对帝国主义和各民族内部的人民公敌，使中华人民共和国成为各民族友爱合作的大家庭。让我们高呼：
    一、中华各民族团结万岁！
    一、中华人民共和国万岁！
    一、人民领袖毛主席万岁！
  　特别邀请代表
    黄琪翔　发言
    主席、各位代表先生：
    首先要声明的：我是站在个人立场说话。这次人民政协所完成的三大建国方案，虽然是到现在才完成了法律手续，可是，他的雏形早就在毛泽东主席的言论以及历年来中国共产党的文告中形成起来的。中国人民百年来的斗争没有白费，三大文件，完全反映出中国广大人民的要求。这是毛泽东思想的结晶，也是中国共产党奋斗的成果。
    二十多年来，我在政治圈里摸索着，我有时鼓舞，也有时彷徨；革命的发展，是那样的错综和复杂，要看得清楚，把握得定，真不是一件容易的事。现在我深深相信：中国是已经走上了光明伟大的前程了。
    对于三大建国方案，我不用再发表任何意见，现在只想说一说我个人的感想。
    也许有人怀疑：方案虽然是好，谁能保证它不会变成空头支票呢？我的答复是：不要人民支持的政权，是可以随便开空头支票的，但结果必定被人民推倒，好象国民党反动派一样。共产党是靠人民支持长大起来的党，由它所领导的人民政权，直接代表着人民的利益，支票是不可能不兑现的。
    有人说：“共产党是不讲信义的，你怎样可以相信它？”但是，经验告诉我：共产党是最讲信义的。
    更有人说：“对外关系为什么要一边倒呢？我们站在苏美中间，利用它们，调解它们，做一座桥梁不很好吗？”各位代表先生，我也曾经这样想过。我前年到欧洲去，是想实际观察战后美苏两大强国的政策，到底有无调协的可能，欧洲各国的真实情形又是怎么样？我希望从欧洲问题上去了解世界问题，同时也就帮助了我了解中国革命问题。到柏林后，我看得很清楚，美国帝国主义的扩张政策，向战后的欧洲横冲直撞，但是它给苏联和东欧民主国家挡住了。尽管美国内心焦燥，叫嚣战争，它没有把苏联吓倒。苏联坚定的把握住和平政策，不侵犯，也不退让。西欧各国战后贫困不堪。美国的所谓马歇尔救济计划，实际上是等于一面输血，一面抽血。尤其是对于德国问题，美帝国主义者是丝毫没有解决的诚意的。他的大欲，是想把西德变成经济和军事的堡垒，以便进攻苏联。现在我明白了：只要帝国主义存在一天，它是不愿意和苏联及任何其他人民国家合作的。这样我们还能调解它们吗？
    再拿它对中国的政策来说吧，为什么它一定要援助国民党反动派呢？是因为人民解放运动根本上和帝国主义利益不相容。我们还能利用它吗？
    我们要知道：今天美帝国主义的财富是从内内外外剥削得来的，如果它让中国人民解放，那就等于自动抛弃剥削的对象，它会那样愚蠢吗？今天美国和苏联，一个是我们的敌人，一个是我们的朋友，我们决不能对它们作等量齐观之想，“美苏桥梁”的好梦时期早已过去了，我们赶快醒来吧！
    各位代表先生，美帝鼓励下的国民党反动派封锁政策，我们也不怕它。一百年前帝国主义者就曾经用大炮打破我们的国门，要求通商，来达成它侵略和剥削的目的。现在眼看我们中国人站起来了，不能继续剥削下去了，便要来封锁我们，这种无耻而又矛盾的政策，受害的将不是我们而是美帝国主义自己。让它们封锁吧，我们惯于刻苦的中国人民，正好利用这机会自己创造起来，建设起来。
    我们的新民主主义的中国，将带来了中国历史上一个新时代，这是不容怀疑的！有毛主席的领导，有各民主党派及全国绝大多数人民的合作，有强大的人民解放军做卫队，政权是巩固的。有计划的生产经济建设，一定能够提高人民的生活水准，大多数人民也会有接受文化教育的机会。各兄弟民族和谐地团结在一起。在外交上我们和苏联合作，和新民主主义国家合作，和各国革命人士合作，我们拥护世界和平，相信苏联和中国有足够的力量保障和平。我们坚决地反对美帝国主义到底。
    各位代表先生，中华人民共和国的成立和苏联公开宣布有了原子武器，这两件事是今天世界历史上值得大书特书的！让我们高呼：
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
    人民领袖毛主席万岁！

    王国兴　发言
    少数民族向来被统治者认为做苦工，出钱，出粮，做奴隶是够“资格”的，但参与讨论国家大事是没有份的。
    今天不同了，共产党不但分给我们田地，同时也分给我们参与讨论国家大事的权利了。
    我们只有永远跟着共产党走，跟着毛主席走，我们的一切权利，才会得到保障；我们的前途，才会光明灿烂。（⑵⑶）
    我们对人民政协的一切决议是坚决拥护的，同时向大会保证，我们一定将大会的精神与决议，传达给每一个黎族同胞，他们一定会象过新年般的来庆祝它，一条条的去实行它。
    我还要告诉大家，我们要提高我们的政治、经济和文化，今后还希望诸位给我们更多的帮助。
    最后，祝毛主席朱总司令以及全体代表健康。
    中华全国教育工作者代表会议筹备委员会代表
    林砺儒　发言
    我们教育工作者代表对三个文件一致赞同，已经由首席代表报告了。现在再补充说几句我们对于共同纲领第五章的理解和今后教育工作的重点：
    第一点：今后我们的科学、文艺及教育都要无保留地为新民主主义政治经济服务，过去那种超越政治的科学、教育和文艺的见解是虚伪的、错误的、结局必然为反动政治效劳而不自觉。今后我们必须坚决、干净摒弃这种错误见解。
    第二点：今后教育工作必须以工农阶级为主要的对象。占全国人民百分之八十以上的工农大众是反帝国主义、反封建主义、和反官僚资本主义的主力军，也是今后建设新国家的主力，他们一向在反动政权压迫之下，久与文化教育隔离，这回人民的国家，人民的政府，就要迅速负责补偿他们的损失。纲领四十一条提高人民文化水准，在目前主要的应该是指工农大众。至于“培养国家建设人才”固然要改造青年知识分子和旧知识分子，也更要注意培养大批工农阶级出身的知识分子。如此，才是真正为大多数人民服务。
    第三点：纲领四十六条指明了教育方法为理论与实际一致。这是要我们去澈底改革旧教育的错误。旧教育一向为地主官僚所独占，他们只凭教育来造资格，装点身份，所以必然与生活实际脱节。今后文化教育应该成为人民进行革命斗争和建设新国家的工具，因此就必须和人民的革命斗争需要结合起来，就必须与国家的经济政治建设结合起来。
    总括地说，我们的理解，今后教育工作的重点应该是工农大众，这样，教育才成为为人民服务的工具，才成为保卫和发展人民民主专政的武器。
　　国内少数民族代表
    朱德海　发言
    主席、各位代表先生们：
    在我们中国东北境内的朝鲜人民，能够有权利派代表参加今天全国人民的政治协商会议，来共同商讨建国大事，这对于我们朝鲜人民，是莫大的光荣与无限的鼓舞。我代表在东北境内的一百二十多万朝鲜人民，完全同意我们少数民族首席代表刘格平先生的发言，坚决的拥护会议的三大文件，并为其彻底实现而奋斗。
    各位代表，将近百年来，尤其是从日寇吞并朝鲜那时起，朝鲜人民，由于不愿意受亡国的痛苦，和无法生存在自己的乡土，而逃避到兄弟之邦的东北，辛勤劳作，开辟了广大渺无人烟的荒凉土地，满怀着希望和中国的人民兄弟，和睦相处；但是东北的封建地主、军阀又与日寇相勾结，挑拨中、朝人民的感情，实行剥削、压迫的反动统治。勤劳、勇敢的朝鲜人民，他们却始终不屈不挠的坚持了反对反动统治的斗争！
    远在“九一八”事变以前，东北境内的朝鲜人民，就已经在中国共产党的领导下，与中国人民站在同一行列，进行反对日寇和东北封建地主、军阀的革命斗争。“九一八”事变以后，朝鲜人民和中国人民一道，坚持了十四年的残酷游击战争，反对我们的共同敌人——日本帝国主义及伪满洲国。“八一五”初期，东北的朝鲜人民，更坚决的站在中国共产党的领导下，夺取武装，协助苏联，进军打击日寇，解放全东北，肃清敌伪残余。蒋介石“劫收”东北，朝鲜人民又和东北人民一道，参加了三年以来的自卫战争，打垮了反动派。在这一伟大的斗争过程中，实行了土地改革，每一个朝鲜人民和东北人民一样，按人口分得了同样的土地、耕畜、农具、房屋及其他生活资料，并以平等的地位参加了解放区的政治、经济、文化等各方面的建设工作（现在已培养了六千多名参加到各种工作中去的民族干部，已有了一所大学，四所师范学校，七十几个中学，一千五百多所小学，出版了民族的报纸）。使历史上一贯受压迫，受苦难的朝鲜人民获得了彻底的大翻身！
    必须指出：朝鲜人民今天所得到的胜利成果，是由于中国共产党领导的正确的民族政策，和中国各族人民的大团结，共同奋斗所得到的！东北朝鲜人民是中华民族构成的一个部分，是中华各族人民大家庭中的一员！
    因此，我们东北的朝鲜人民，就必须永远和中国国内各族人民团结一致，在共产党和毛主席的领导下，在即将成立的中央人民政府的领导下，为建设新民主主义的新中国而奋斗！
    中华人民共和国成立万岁！
    中国人民政治协商会议成功万岁！

    少数民族苗族代表
    朱早观　发言
    主席，各位代表先生：
    中国人民政治协商会议成功，这是新中国整个民族人民在世界上挺起身来的新时代，同时也就是中国古老、朴实，遭受几千年压迫、奴役，被逼促在西南边隅数百万苗族人民大翻身的日子。
    中国历史上的反动统治者，也曾有过一些好看的文告，但在被压迫的苗族人民看来，只是“狗矢不如”的东西。因为那些东西的实质，是反动统治者压迫和欺骗人民的工具。不会丝毫有利于人民的。
    今天，我们的人民政协会议所拟订的三个文件是我们中国人民自己的宪章，确是毫无例外的适合每一个民族人民的切身要求，尤其是苗族人民，一经闻知，更会感到从来未有的温暖与快乐。因为，从此苗族人民真正成了各族人民友爱合作大家庭中的一员，再不会有任何民族的压迫和歧视了。
    早在十多年前，中国共产党及我们的毛主席，朱总司令率领红军北上抗日，举行万里长征的时候，曾经一度走遍了西南我们苗人区域，我们苗族人民，就亲身体会了这种大家庭的友爱亲洽，这种民族团结的温暖，虽然为时不久，但已造成迄今不忘的印象。多少年来，我们苗族人民无一不在祝祷和盼望这种温暖亲洽赶快到来，他们说：“客人（苗人叫汉人为客人）都象红军那样，我们也不用六十年造一次反啦！”（苗族俗语相传六十年造反一次）由此，我们可以认识，我们苗族和国内其他兄弟民族一样是爱好和平的人民，决不是反动的统治者所经常污蔑我们，侮辱我们的所谓“野蛮”与“不服王化”！
    中华人民共和国一经宣告成立，我们苗族人民将在共产党毛主席的英明领导之下，在中央人民政府领导之下，在各兄弟民族互相友爱帮助之下，以自己吃苦耐劳的生活习惯，纯朴勤谨的精神，建设我们的大家庭，并在文化教育上努力提高自己。我们热烈地庆贺中国人民政治协商会议的成功，庆贺中华人民共和国的诞生！
    台湾民主自治同盟高山族代表
    田富达　发言
    毛主席、朱总司令、各位代表先生：
    我是参加政协的台湾民主自治同盟单位中的少数民族——高山族人民的代表。在这个会议中能有人口仅三十万左右的高山族人民自己的代表参加，使我极感到从来未有过的无限的兴奋与光荣！
    中国人民政协的召开，给我们将就要迅速得到解放的高山族人民带来了各民族平等各民族互相合作的大团结的新的民族生活。它将要引导我们向新的文明的科学的健康的道路前进！从此以后我们就可能脱离那被帝国主义与异民族统治者所侵略、压迫、侮辱、分化、挑拨、和不文明的、落后的、原始的、甚至野蛮的、黑暗的旧民族生活。
    高山族人民是台湾的原来的住民，三百多年来曾受过荷兰、西班牙、满清、日本等侵略者的无情的压榨，惨害与屠杀，而在这时期中高山族人民不断和这些侵略者作惨酷的斗争，但终于被赶到一般人不能够生存的深山里去了。尤其在日本帝国主义者的统治时期内，本来我们有十多个种族因被数次的大屠杀的结果，只残剩下七个种族。人口减少了。一九三○年十月雾社的高山人民起来反抗日本帝国主义者，和它的武装警察、陆军、空军打了一个多月的硬仗，虽然我们的力量很薄弱，可是我们利用山地的有利条件没有屈服，最后他们用飞机遍山散播毒气，因此这一个种族就完全被消灭了。这次的斗争虽然又失败了，可是领导这次斗争的烈士们，尤其是花冈一郎的反帝国主义的精神，仍然在我们高山人民的脑筋里永远不忘。国民党反动派统治台湾以后，依然对我们高山族和其他各族人民施行压迫、剥削、歧视、屠杀的那一套。这个事实教训了我们，使我们认识到我们的痛苦，并不是单纯的民族压迫的问题，而是所有反动派对国内各民族的压迫的问题，也因此教育了我们必须和全台湾人民在一起，进而和全国人民一道，澈底向这个美帝国主义所支持的国民党反动派作坚决的斗争，才能得到解放。二二八民变就是我们和全台湾人民联合起来向它作斗争的最典型的例子。
    这次人民政协所要通过的三大文件，尤其是共同纲领中关于民族政策的四个条文，不但是我们所完全同意，而且是比我们在长期斗争中所要求的目标，更加理想，更加完善。因此，我们就不只是一般地拥护支持，而且为了这个纲领的完全实现，愿不怕任何牺牲，都要斗争到底。
    最后，我还要提出一个希望，因为我们高山人民现在的生活，还是很原始的落后的，七个种族有各不相同的语言，而都没有文字，因此我们要求全国人民和即将成立的人民中央政府赶快解放台湾人民，并在解放后，依照纲领第五十三条的精神积极帮助我们发展政治、经济、文化、教育、卫生等的建设事业。这样，真正的民族平等，和各民族的大团结才能彻底实现。
    将来我们保证在人民政协和中央政府的领导下与全国人民一道，尽我们一切所有的力量参加建设和巩固独立、民主、和平、统一、富强与各民族友爱合作的大家庭——中华人民共和国。
    庆祝人民政协完满成功！

    我同意首席代表刘格平先生的发言，大会的三个文献，我是完全拥护的，并且希望大会迅速地通过，赶快把它传播到我们藏族的广大人民里面去！
    现在英、美帝国主义者，正在利用它们的忠实走狗——尼赫鲁进一步地阴谋侵略我们的西藏，企图把我们藏族人民沦为它们的奴隶牛马。
    藏族人民的真正自由解放，只有在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，只有在朱总司令指挥的人民解放军的帮助下，也只有在中国各族人民共同亲密的团结下，才能实现！
    我们要警告这些帝国主义强盗们！如果你们敢于和四万万七千万的中国各族人民为敌，你们就一定会在伟大的中国人民力量面前受到应得的惩罚！
    我们青海，甘肃的藏民兄弟姊妹们已经获得解放了，整个的藏族人民，也一定会在不久的将来获得最后的解放！
    藏族同胞们！大家赶快起来，配合人民解放军，驱逐帝国主义和它的走狗们，在毛泽东的旗帜下，努力奋斗，求得我们藏族人民彻底的翻身！
  　特别邀请代表
    汪世铭　发言
    主席、各位代表先生：
    我是革新民主社会党负责人之一。三年前因为张君劢及其走狗们破坏旧的政协，破坏民主统一战线，厚颜无耻的参加了伪国大，参加了伪政府，为蒋介石反动政权帮凶，这三年来的内战，张君劢是要负一大部分责任的。我们党内忠于民主与和平的同志们表示万分的愤慨，不能不起来反对他，打击他，所以才有革新的民主社会党的组织。我们三年来为打击张君劢及其所参加的封建官僚勾结美帝国主义的反动统治，作不断的艰苦的斗争。因此有许多同志受了蒋匪特务的迫害，坐了牢，受了刑，甚至牺牲了他们的性命。但是我们内部存在着许多缺点，例如组织不健全，分子复杂，又没有严格的纪律，往往发生了错误的言论与行动，招致恶劣的影响。我坦白地承认这些错误，并诚恳地接受批评。
    在过去为打击张君劢及其所参加的封建官僚勾结美帝国主义的反动政权，我们有组织的必要，也尽了一部分的责任。今天情形不同了。在中国共产党和伟大的人民领袖毛主席领导下，全国的解放，已不远了，人民的革命，即将全面胜利了。这个划时代的人民政治协商会议的召开，就是这人民革命伟大胜利的果实。这次会议制订的中央人民政府组织法，中国人民政协组织法和共同纲领——就是中国人民的大宪章。在这三个文件内，我们得到了三个结论：第一、我们有了统一的领导——就是中国共产党和毛主席的领导；第二、我们有了统一的路线——就是在国内实行以工人阶级为领导，工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政，在国际联合以苏联为首的爱好和平自由的各人民民主国家，反对以美帝为首的资本主义国家的侵略；第三、我们有了统一的目标——就是新民主主义的政治、经济、文化的建设，达成中国的独立、民主、和平、统一与富强。有了统一的领导，有了统一的路线，有了统一的目标，我们的要求，我们的愿望，都已完全达到了。我们党的组织与活动，再也没有必要了。所以我们已决定结束我们党的活动，取消我们党的组织。我们的同志有的因为历史关系，将要加入民主同盟，有的参加新民主主义的青年组织，有的参加学习与工作了。我们将在不同的岗位上，接受统一的领导——中国共产党和毛主席的领导，遵循统一的路线，向着统一的目标，努力迈进。
    最后我还要向各位代表先生说几句话。我们参加了这个伟大的会议，受到了中国共产党和毛主席的精神感召，听到了许多的宝贵言论与意见。大会就要闭幕了。我们要学蜜蜂，采了花就要造蜜，为人民辛苦，为人民忙。我们要学蚕，吃饱了就要吐丝，织成锦缎，织成花，织成新民主主义之花，织成人民革命全面胜利之花。
　　中国民主同盟代表
    罗隆基　发言
    主席，诸位代表先生：
    中国人民政治协商会议第一届全体大会从今天起要进入最重要并且最光辉的阶段，中国人民政治协商会议就要正式通过了中国有史以来三个神圣尊严的法案：
    中国人民政治协商会议组织法
    中华人民共和国中央人民政府组织法
    中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领
    当我们全体代表站起来一致通过这三个法案的时候，这正表明了毛泽东主席在大会开幕词中的一句话：
    “占世界人类四分之一的中国人从此站立起来了！”
    如今中国人民站起来向全世界宣告：这三个法案，从今天起，是中国人民共同的宪章，是中国人民共同的意志，是中国人民共同的行动！
    毛泽东主席在大会开幕词中说得十分真确。“我们的工作将写在人类的历史上”。对的，一千九百四十九年九月，我们在这个时期中的工作，会永远写在人类的历史上。这比英国人一千二百一十五年的工作伟大。那只是封建地主抬头的日子。这比美国人一千七百七十四年七月四日的工作伟大，这比法国人一千七百八十九年七月十四日的工作伟大。那只是资产阶级抬头的日子。今天，今天是我们中国人民打倒封建势力，打倒官僚资本主义的日子。这是中国人民广大群众真正翻身，真正抬头的日子！
    诸位代表先生！我这里对打倒帝国主义的侵略还要说几句话。
    当我们在伟大的北京首都通过这个伟大的人民大宪章的时候，我立即联想到了在美帝国主义的纽约的成功湖，也同时在进行一个会议，那就是联合国大会的会议。在联合国大会中不幸，中国国民中有一个败类，有一个名叫蒋廷黻的败类，代表着中国的反动残余，代表着广州的伪小朝廷，在成功湖无耻叫嚣，乞求外援，妄图假借帝国主义的势力来阻碍并破坏我们的革命建国事业！
    我今天要正告联合国大会：
    蒋介石今天是中国人民的公敌。蒋介石今天是中国第一号战犯。蒋介石今天是从伪总统座位上滚下来了落荒而逃的一个逃犯。蒋介石是美帝国主义的奴才。蒋廷黻是蒋介石的奴才。我今天要引用水浒传上一句话，告诉全世界说：蒋廷黻是“奴才的奴才的奴才”。
    到今天，南京伪政府早已垮台了。联合国大会还要容许蒋廷黻这样一个败类，在大会中做无耻的叫嚣，这是对联合国的讽刺！这是对联合国的嘲笑，这是联合国的最大的耻辱！
    这里，我们不是攻击联合国大会。我们大宪章的共同纲领第五十四条说得明明白白清清楚楚，中华人民共和国拥护国际的持久和平。因此，我们中国人民当然拥护国际间真正维持世界永久和平的机构。但我们坚决反对美帝国主义领导的侵略集团，操纵把持联合国大会，反对美帝国主义把联合国大会变成战争贩子们破坏人类和平，制造世界战争的工具！
    联合国大会是第二次世界大战胜利的成果。联合国大会的建立，中国人民交付了重大的代价。在中国方面，只有中国人民的代表，只有中华人民共和国的代表，才能享受联合国大会代表的权利。这个权利是我们中华人民共和国的权利。今天在成功湖的联合国大会中，蒋廷黻代表着蒋介石，一个姓蒋的代表了一个姓蒋的，居然胆敢在联合国大会中窃据代表坐位，无耻叫嚣起来。他居然胆敢自称为中国代表，而从事毁谤中国人民的建国事业。我们中国人民绝对不能容许这种事实存在。
    我们中国人民今天严正的向联合国大会声明，在今天这种情况下，在蒋廷黻这败类没有被赶出大会以前，在我们中华人民共和国的合法代表没有出席大会以前，联合国大会的任何决议，我们中国人民不能受他的约束。我们中国人民绝对不能承认这种决议，在中国有法律的效力。到这里，我还要大声的唤醒美帝国主义者，你们今天应该澈头澈脑的觉悟了！历年以来，我曾经一再的警告你们，蒋介石政权与中国人民是势不两立的，谁要援助蒋介石，谁就是中国人民的敌人，谁就要遭受到严重的打击，落一个悲惨的失败。如今这本一千余页的白皮书，是你们悲惨失败的记录，亦是美帝国主义者良好的教训。今天我还要警告美帝国主义的政府，承认失败罢！死心塌地的放弃你们那“以华乱华”的捣乱政策罢！四万万七千五百万站起来了的中国人，胜过你们千百个原子弹。我们有了抵抗，打击，粉碎美帝国主义者任何阴谋诡计的力量了！
    我们的人民大宪章全部就要通过了！我们政治协商会议就要把中华人民共和国光明正大的外交政策公诸世界。
    占世界人类四分之一的中国人站立起来了！我们全体人民，一心一德，精诚团结，在我们英明领袖毛泽东主席领导之下，要共同努力来实现我们的外交政策。我们的政策是拥护世界永久和平。同时我们坚决的反对战争。我们更坚强的要打倒帝国侵略主义！

    我代表我们全体人民空军，以热烈兴奋的心情，来庆祝人民政治协商会议的成功！我们忠诚拥护“中国人民政治协商会议组织法”，“中华人民共和国中央人民政府组织法”和“中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领”。并在中央人民政府和人民革命军事委员会的领导下坚决为实现这些决议而奋斗。
    我起初投考空军就是为了抗日救国。可是在美国学完归国，国民党反动派就驱使我们打内战，用外国的武器残杀自己的同胞，与我们青年救国的志愿完全相反。所以我在一九四六年六月看到毛主席反对美国军事援蒋的声明后，认清了美帝国主义利用蒋介石做工具来实现侵略中国计划的阴谋。因此决心起义，冒险飞到延安，以便在中国共产党领导下为中国的独立解放而斗争。现在美帝国主义的侵略中国的阴谋已经完全暴露无余了；蒋介石的卖国求荣，甘作美帝国主义的走狗的事实，是谁都知道的了，而且最后灭亡的日子就在眼前了。我要警告国民党所有的空军人员，如果你们不愿意做蒋介石的奴才，做美帝国主义奴才的奴才，你们就应当立即翻然悔悟，投到人民解放军方面来。如果继续助桀为虐，残杀同胞，全国人民再不会饶恕你们的了！让你们犹豫的时间已经很短很短了，你们究竟愿意随蒋介石一同灭亡，遗臭万年，还是投降到人民方面来，立功自赎，继续为国家、为人民效力，请你们自决罢！
    我个人愿意终身服务于人民空军。我敢向大会保证：一定努力工作，克服困难，为建设一支强大的为人民服务的空军而奋斗，使我们的空军能和我们的陆军、海军兄弟部队共同组成保卫祖国、保卫人民的强大国防军，使任何一个帝国主义都不敢来侵犯我们伟大的祖国。

    主席团、各位代表先生：
    我是一个搞工程的，不会说话，而且口齿不清，所以平常很少上台讲话。此次得参加旷古未有的开国典礼，感觉兴奋，所以稍将我的感想，来说几句，若是说得不对，或听不清楚，请大家原谅和指正。
    我是服务各工厂三十余年的人，深深地感到工业应为大众谋福利，也深深地感到工业建设，必依靠工人，所以我素来提倡工人教育，曾办工人业余补习教育二十余年，也办过技工学校八九年，总想培养与增高工人的知识和技能，使他们能负起工业建设的责任。
    中华人民共和国，订定以工人阶级为领导，这是极合理极恰当的。今后我们工程师，应积极，热心，切实地教授工人们以实际应用的知识和技能，以增进他们领导力量，尤其应该提高他们的政治觉悟，使他们明了自己的责任，而起领导作用，工业才能合理的迅速的发展。就是我们工程师，也多不管政治，不明白政治，不爱谈政治，有时不免将工作方向弄错，我本人也是不喜欢政治的一个，今后也须着重政治意识，方不致劳而无功，或致有害。
    现在中华人民共和国人民政府成立了，施政纲领已订出来了，我们工程师今后不怕没有适当的工作乐园，以为人民服务了，下一步就是看怎么样去做。
    中国一切落后，而工业更落后，人力，财力和物力都不多，想于最短时间，建设起来，实非易事。所以不论公家和私人，不论国营或私营事业，都应该在国家统一整个计划之下，根据毛主席所指示的“公私兼顾，劳资两利，城乡互助，内外交流”的政策，为着发展生产，繁荣经济的目标，有步骤的切实地做去，才有希望。就是说：可缓做的，纵有利可图，也不准做，可省用的，纵容易做，也不准做。何地应做何事业，何种物品应做多少，何者应照何种方式去做，何者应裁并，何者纵无利益，也应用补贴和奖励方法去做，甚至何种人应做何种事，都由国家斟酌情形一一规定。也就是国家建设，一切须专业化，分业化，标准化，供求合理化，损益是统算的。如现今建设最要紧的，莫过于交通和动力，纵令这两项建设花费多，且有亏损，而间接兴起的事业必多，因之国家所得的利益，通盘计算反而极大。又人总是要吃和穿，与其只吃和穿而无事可做，不如找事给他做，总有几分生产和帮助生产，所以建设国家事业的重心和步骤，不可不注意的，为通盘打算。
    除有计划，有步骤，极经济地去建设而外，全国国民，应全心全意地，各尽所能地去做。现今有英明的毛主席领导，我全国国民应该觉悟警惕起来，大家艰苦地去干才对。我想大家应当放在心里的起码的条件，就是：
    第一点　大家节衣缩食，崇尚俭朴勤诚，决不浪费和做假。
    第二点　大家尽量使用国货，不用奢侈品，凡可以输出的，应该节省，应该多做，以输出而争取外汇，为建设之需。
    第三点　视公事和公物如私事和私物，视私事和私物如公事和公物，实在说，国家社会化的终极，人生的终极，就无公和私的分别。
    第四点　封建思想，派别和乡土观念，地盘主义，本位和个人主义，领袖欲，支配欲等，种种狭隘和自私的念头，都应除掉，只求有利于国家和人民，个人一切都不应计较。
    以上是我一时的感想和意见，当这工业建设开始迈步前进的时候，特此贡献，并祝新中国建设迅速成功！

    主席、各位代表先生：
    划时代的中国人民政治协商会议已经开幕了。中国人民和中国境内各民族的空前大团结，在这次会议中达到了有史以来的最高度，因为现在已经是人民当政了。
    在会议中曾经详加研讨，即将胜利通过的三大文献，特别是共同纲领，这是中国近代革命发展的结晶，新民主主义新中国建设的一个精美图案。新中国的诞生，将使中国人民第一次真正的在全世界面前站立起来了。
    近百年来多少革命烈士与爱国志士曾经前仆后继，屡败屡起，牺牲了多少性命，流了多少血汗而不曾实现的愿望，今天实现了，因此我们不能不感谢中国先进的工人阶级的政党——共产党与中国人民伟大领袖毛主席的正确领导。
    可是今天还有不少的革命先进和爱国志士，为了反对卖国贼蒋介石而失去自由，身陷囹圄。如一九三六年反对蒋介石卖国“剿共”政策领导西安事变的张学良将军和我的父亲杨虎城将军已被蒋介石拘囚十三年之久，至今过着牢狱生活，便是很明显的例子。他们现在虽然不能亲眼看到我们革命的胜利，甚至随时还有被杀害的危险，但是当他们还健在的时候，只要一听到政协开幕，与新中国即将诞生的消息时，我想他们是会从衷心里得到最大的安慰；因为他们的牺牲，受苦受难，而企求的愿望，今天真正的实现了。
    今天的历史再次证明蒋介石国民党反动派，以任何屠杀，刑狱，特务等手段都不能阻止人民革命的怒潮，而在人民大革命与人民解放战争面前，这一小撮中华民族的败类，即将化为粉末而被倾入历史的垃圾坑中了。
    我愿在毛主席朱总司令和大会面前保证，我要将对敌人的仇恨化为革命的力量，更坚定革命的意志和站稳自己的工作岗位，坚决执行中央人民政府与人民解放军的一切命令和人民政协的决议为建设独立、自由、和平、统一、富强的新中国而奋斗到底。
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    毛主席朱总司令万岁！

    张学思　发言
    主席，诸位代表先生：
    中国人民政治协商会议的召开，是宣布了旧中国的灭亡与新中国的诞生。它标志着中国人民解放战争的胜利，中国人民大团结的胜利，毛主席思想的胜利。
    百余年来中国人民及一切爱国志士为着中国的新生，前仆后继，英勇奋斗，有的已光荣牺牲，有的至今仍被残余的反动势力所羁押的张学良、杨虎城两将军等，今天他们虽未能看到新中国的诞生或者亲身参加这个盛典，但是他们现在已得到最大的安慰。筹委会提出的三大草案，解决了中国的迫切问题，它是目前中国人民的大宪章，中国人民从此进入一个人民民主的新时代，中国人民从此站起来了，我谨代表中国人民海军向大会表示，我们对这三大历史文献完全赞同，并愿为其彻底实现而奋斗。
    中国人民海军以一个幼年的资格，列于伟大的中国人民解放军的行列，由于人民解放战争的胜利开展，由于国民党海军中爱国人士的起义，不但是瓦解了敌人的海军，且使中国人民海军迅速增强。
    我们今后一定坚决彻底的执行共同纲领中关于军事制度的一切要求，使海军成为统一的人民军队的一部分，并根据官兵一致，军民一致的原则，建立政治工作制度，学习与发扬人民解放军的优良传统，以革命精神和爱国精神教育我海军指战员，提高全体人员的政治质量与军事技术，并有步骤地培养人民海军的干部。我们一定在实际行动中贯彻毛主席朱总司令的号召，为建设一个强大的中国人民海军而奋斗。
    我们决用最大的努力，迅速地加强作战准备，随时在中央人民政府和革命军事委员会的号令下，配合人民空军，协助强大的人民陆军，去解放舟山群岛、海南岛、以及台湾，彻底粉碎美帝国主义窃取台湾的阴谋，肃清帝国主义走狗蒋介石匪帮及一切反动派的残余势力，将人民解放战争进行到底，保卫中国人民的领海，巩固国防。
    　　庆祝
    中国人民政治协商会议胜利成功！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    毛主席朱总司令万岁！

    刘清扬　发言
    主席，诸位代表先生：
    在这史无前例的空前大团结的人民政治协商会议中，使我发生了无限的感想。在毛主席、朱总司令、周副主席，以及各位代表所发表的许多宝贵意见中，不但给了我以学习的机会，而且更引起了我不少的反省和警惕。
    由于人民解放战争的伟大胜利，而收获了今日政协大会的果实。在这里首先使我想起了三十年来无数英勇牺牲的烈士们不屈不挠的奋斗精神，在大会开始致哀时，我不能自制的流了眼泪，但在今天诸烈士都已得到了安慰。在女同志中的向警予，黄励，和郭隆真等诸位烈士以及在抗战中，前仆后继，英勇牺牲的许多男女英雄，他们从容就义的坚强伟大，使我永远不能忘记。希望在中央人民政府成立后，早日表扬诸位烈士艰苦卓绝奋斗的史实。
    其次我认为中国共产党高瞻远瞩的宽大政策，是非常成功的！从召开北京市各界代表会议以及在这一次的政协大会中，实在是充分表现了民主精神。这样大度包容了各方面希望追求进步的人士，可以说，不能不使人由衷的感动而反省并担心自己的不够而惭愧。所以不能不使进步人士心悦诚服，而愿意在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，忠诚的为了拥护并实现三大建国文件的成功而努力。
    第三、本会对于三大建国文件草案，在大会前，和大会中，都曾分组的或集体的慎密讨论了许多次，集思广益后，才提出于大会。在讨论的时候，我个人常犯急性错误的偏向，认为不必要的话，是可以不必说的，但在负责领导讨论的同志，总是耐心的给人人以知无不言、言无不尽的说话机会。这一显明的事实，确已胜过雄辩，这足以反证了反动派所宣传说共产党不给人民以自由的谣言。
    这一次空前的建国盛典，诚如李秀真同志所说：这都是人民大众的血汗换来的，所以我们每个参加大会的代表，今后都不能不忠诚的以切实行动服务于人民，而把革命进行到底，以坚决的信心，努力达到建设强大无比的中华人民共和国，把帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义完全消灭！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    伟大的毛主席万岁！
    朱总司令万岁！（附图片）
