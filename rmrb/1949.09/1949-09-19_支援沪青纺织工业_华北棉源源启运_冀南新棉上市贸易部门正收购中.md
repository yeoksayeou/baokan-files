　　Supporting Shanghai and Qingdao Textile Industries
　　North China Cotton Flows Steadily
　　New Cotton from Southern Hebei Enters the Market, Trade Departments Actively Purchasing
[Tianjin News] In order to support the textile industries of Shanghai and Qingdao, the North China Cotton, Yarn and Cloth Company is purchasing raw cotton from North China. The first batch is planned to be 8 million jin, of which 1.2 million jin destined for Qingdao has already been shipped, and the 6.8 million jin bound for Shanghai is also being shipped successively, expected to be completed by the end of this month. In addition, 2 million jin of imported American cotton has also been shipped to Shanghai. After the liberation of Shanghai, Qingdao and other places, large-scale modern textile industries came under the ownership of the people. However, due to past wars and the Kuomintang reactionary government's reliance on foreign cotton policies, the textile raw material supply in Shanghai, Qingdao and other places is currently severely lacking. Therefore, supporting the East China textile industry has become an urgent task for the North China Cotton, Yarn and Cloth Company. In order to complete this urgent task, the company's storage and transportation workers have demonstrated a high degree of initiative. For example, during the loading and shipping of 1.1 million jin of domestic cotton and 2 million jin of American cotton from Tianjin, the workers of the company's Tianjin Fifth Warehouse worked from 7 am to 8 pm every day, without rest on Sundays, and finally completed the loading of more than 3 million jin of cotton in six days, ensuring the raw cotton supply for the Shanghai textile industry.
　　[Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 17th] New cotton from the cotton-producing areas of southern Hebei Province has been successively entering the market. State-owned trade departments and cooperatives are vigorously organizing purchases. Although the area has experienced droughts and insect plagues this year, cotton production still reaches about 60% to 70% of normal.
　　[Xingtai Telegram] In villages around Wangdazhai, Nan'gong First District, most of the 2BS-type cotton has begun to fluff, and new cotton has been seen. Qu Jiantang's twelve mu of cotton in Wangdazhai harvested fifty jin on the first picking. On August 31st, the Nangong Trading Company set up a cotton purchasing station in Wangdazhai to buy 2BS-type cotton at high prices.

　　支援沪青纺织工业
　  华北棉源源启运
　  冀南新棉上市贸易部门正收购中
    【天津讯】华北花纱布公司收购华北原棉，支援上海、青岛两地的纺织工业，第一批计划运八百万斤，其中运往青岛的一百二十万斤已运毕，运上海的六百八十万斤也正陆续启运，预计本月底可以运完。此外进口美棉二百万斤也已运往上海。按沪、青等地解放后，大规模的现代纺织工业归人民所有，但由于过去战争和国民党反动政府依赖外棉的政策，使目前沪、青等地纺织原料严重缺乏，因此，支援华东纺织工业就成为华北花纱布公司的紧急任务，为了完成此项紧急任务，花纱布公司负责储运的职工发挥了高度的积极性，如这次从津启运的一百一十万斤国棉和二百万斤美棉的装运中，该公司所属天津第五仓库的职工们每天晨七时上班下午八时才歇班，星期日也不休息，终于在六天里把三百多万斤棉花装车完毕，保证了上海纺织工业的原棉供给。
    【新华社北平十七日电】河北省南部产棉区的新棉已陆续上市，国营贸易部门和合作社正大力组织收购。该地区今年虽经旱、虫等灾，但棉产量仍达六、七成左右。
    【邢台电】南宫一区王大寨一带村庄，二Ｂ斯字棉大部已开始吐絮，现已见到新花。王大寨曲建堂十二亩棉花，第一次就摘了五十斤。八月三十一日，南宫贸易公司在王大寨设立收花庄，高价收买二Ｂ斯字棉。
