    The Close Feelings of People's Unity
    The ACFTU presented a banner to the CPPCC, the Xinjiang delegation presented a banner to the CPPCC and presented Uyghur clothing and hats to Chairman Mao, and the Northwest Hui representatives presented a banner to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu.
    Interspersed between the representatives' speeches were three moving procedures. The first was the presentation of a banner to the CPPCC meeting by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, presented by railway engine driver Li Yong and five others, accepted by the executive chairman on behalf of the CPPCC meeting, and followed by a brief speech by Li Yong. The banner read, "The entire Chinese working class resolutely supports the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and strives for its Common Program." The second was the presentation of a banner to the CPPCC by the Xinjiang delegation on behalf of the people of Xinjiang, and the presentation of hats and coats of the Xinjiang Uyghur people (the ethnic group that makes up 80% of Xinjiang's population) to Chairman Mao. The banner was written in both Chinese and Uyghur, reading "Celebrating the First Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, which has great historical significance for the bright future of the Chinese people." When presenting the hats and coats, Saifuddin, the head of the Xinjiang delegation, said: "The people's leader, Chairman Mao Zedong, has opened up a path to a happy life for the Chinese people, including the people of Xinjiang. For this favor, the people of Xinjiang cannot find a suitable gift to repay. According to our Uyghur national custom, we present national hats and national coats to the most beloved person, and respectfully ask Chairman Mao to accept these two simple gifts as a memento." Chairman Mao, filled with deep emotion, warmly shook hands with each of the Xinjiang representatives, putting strength into each handshake. Then, he solemnly walked to the front of the rostrum, put on the large hat called "Tumak," draped the dark green silk coat, and then put on the casual hat called "Dopa." Military music played, and the entire audience applauded warmly for a long time. The third was the presentation of a banner to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu by Northwest Hui representatives Wu Hongbin and four others. The banner for Chairman Mao read in both Chinese and Hui languages, "The Helmsman of the Chinese People." The banner for Commander-in-Chief Zhu read, "The Savior of the Chinese People." Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu personally accepted the banners and warmly shook hands with each of the Hui representatives. During these three procedures, the close feelings of the people's unity deeply moved and excited the representatives of the entire audience.
    A total of 626 representatives attended the meeting today. The executive chairmen were Gao Gang, Ma Xulun, Cai Tingkai, Chen Jiageng, and Shi Liang. The meeting lasted four hours and twenty minutes.
    [Report from this newspaper] The Chinese working class and ethnic minorities yesterday expressed their highest respect to the People's Political Consultative Conference, to the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong of the Chinese Communist Party, and to General Zhu De, Commander-in-Chief of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. Amidst the brisk music of "The East is Red" and "You are the Beacon," and the frenzied applause of all the representatives, the worker representatives led by Li Yong, the model driver of the "Mao Zedong" locomotive, the Xinjiang people's representatives led by Uyghur Saifuddin, and the Northwest Hui representatives led by Wu Hongbin, successively stepped onto the rostrum. The Chinese workers presented the People's Political Consultative Conference, which is planning the founding of the nation, with a red banner, which like a vow, stated the determination of the entire Chinese working class: to resolutely support the People's Political Consultative Conference and to strive for the thorough realization of its Common Program! The Hui representatives presented a flag written in both Hui and Han languages, and offered congratulations.
    The most touching of the banner and clothing presentations was that of the Xinjiang people's representatives. They presented "national hats" and "national clothing" to the people's leader Chairman Mao with the highest Uyghur etiquette. When Chairman Mao, amidst thunderous applause, accepted the brotherly respect of domestic ethnic minorities on the rostrum, and according to Uyghur custom, draped himself in the precious Xinjiang silk specialty coat "Kafan", and wore the mink winter hat "Tumak" and the summer hat "Dofu" on the spot, almost everyone in the audience stood up and applauded with emotion. In this atmosphere of great national unity, Chairman Mao shook hands with each of the Xinjiang representatives.

    人民团结的亲切感情
    全总向政协献旗，新疆代表团向政协献旗并以维吾尔族的衣帽献给毛主席，西北回族代表向毛主席和朱总司令献旗。
    代表发言之间，插入了三个动人的程序，其一是中华全国总工会向政协会议献旗，由铁路机车司机李永等六人呈献，由执行主席代表政协会议接受，并由李永作简短演说。旗上写着“全中国工人阶级坚决拥护中国人民政治协商会议，并为它的共同纲领而奋斗。”其二为新疆代表团代表新疆人民向政协献旗和向毛主席献新疆维吾尔族（占新疆人口百分之八十的民族）的帽子和外衣。旗子上用汉文和维吾尔文写着“庆祝对中国人民的光明前途有重大历史意义的第一届中国人民政治协商会议”。献帽子和外衣时新疆代表团团长赛福鼎说：“人民领袖毛泽东主席给中国人民也就是给新疆人民开辟了幸福生活的大道。对这个恩惠，我们新疆人民找不到适当的礼物来报答。按我们维族固有的民族习惯，向最敬爱的人，献民族帽子和民族外衣，敬请毛主席收下我们这两件简单的礼物，以作纪念。”毛主席充满了深深感动的神情，热烈地和新疆代表们一一握手，全身都在用着力量，然后庄严地走到主席台的前沿，把叫作“图马克”的大帽戴上，披上那件深绿色丝制的外衣，接着又换上那顶叫作“多普”的便帽。军乐吹奏着，全场热烈鼓着掌，历久不息。其三为西北回族代表吴鸿宾等五人向毛主席和朱总司令献旗。给毛主席的旗上用汉文和回文写着“中国人民的舵师”。给朱总司令的旗上写着“中国人民的救星”。毛主席和朱总司令亲自接受了锦旗，一一和回族代表热烈地握手。进行这三次程序时，人民团结的亲切感情使全场的代表们极为感动和兴奋。
    今日大会共到代表六百二十六人。执行主席为高岗、马叙伦、蔡廷锴、陈嘉庚、史良。会议历时四小时又二十分。
    【本报讯】中国工人阶级和少数民族，昨天向人民政协会议，向中国人民的伟大领袖中国共产党主席毛泽东和中国人民解放军总司令朱德将军，表达了他们的最高敬意。在“东方红”和“你是灯塔”的明快的乐声中，在全体代表的狂热的掌声中，以“毛泽东”号机车模范司机长李永为首的工人代表，以维吾尔族赛福鼎为首的新疆人民代表及以吴鸿宾为首的西北回族代表，曾先后步上了主席台。中国的工人们向筹划开国大计的人民政协会议，献上了一面红色锦旗，旗上象誓言一样道出了全中国工人阶级的决心：坚决拥护人民政治协商会议，并为彻底实现它的共同纲领而奋斗！回族代表献了写着回汉两种文字的旗，并致祝词。
    献旗、献衣帽中，最感人的是新疆人民代表。他们以维吾尔族最高的礼节向人民领袖毛主席献赠“民族帽”和“民族衣”。当毛主席在巨雷般的掌声中，在主席台上接受国内少数民族的兄弟般的敬意，并按照维族的习惯当场披上贵重的新疆丝织特产外衣“卡藩”，戴上用貂皮作的冬帽“吐马克”及夏帽“多福”时，全场所有的人，几乎无例外的站了起来，感动地鼓着掌。在这一民族大团结的气氛中，毛主席和新疆的代表们一一地握着手。
