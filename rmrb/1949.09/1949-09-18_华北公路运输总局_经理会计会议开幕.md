　　North China Highway Transportation Bureau
　　Manager and Accountant Conference Opens

　　[Our Newspaper] The joint conference of managers and accountants of the North China Highway Transportation Bureau opened in Ping (Beijing) on the 16th. More than 40 people attended, including the heads of the Transportation Department of the Bureau, six directly subordinate transportation companies, and six regional companies. The main issues to be resolved at the meeting are: cost accounting, freight rate policy, combined passenger and freight transport, accounting subjects, accounting statements, implementation of the budget system, and internal accounting procedures. Cao Chengzong, Director of the North China Highway Bureau, pointed out in his speech that highway transportation must be standardized in the future, and planned transportation should be gradually implemented. Zhu Tianshun, Director of the Transportation Department, gave a summary report on the work of various companies in the first half of the year. He said that the focus of transportation business in North China has shifted from supporting the front lines to commercial transportation. In order to promote the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas, it is necessary to unite private transportation companies and jointly develop the transportation business. However, at the same time, it is also necessary to fight against their speculative and undesirable styles (such as unprincipled price increases and decreases, fraud, and abduction, etc.). The transportation meeting in March this year criticized the tendency of simply pursuing commercial profits, and general companies have gradually attached importance to transportation business. For example, the gross profit of commercial transportation accounted for 71.2 percent last year, and this year (according to statistics from Handan, Shimen, Houma, Taihang and other companies) it accounts for 47.61 percent. However, we have also neglected the necessity of operating commerce to organize return transportation and expand transportation. This has been quickly corrected later, and this operation of commerce has been approved by the Finance Committee. Thanks to the efforts of all employees, we now have 35 bus routes with a total length of 5,056 kilometers, accounting for 55.7% of the 9,084 kilometers of highways that can be driven in North China; 68 freight yards and ticket offices have been established; the transportation capacity is estimated to be 2,601 tons; there are 612 operable vehicles and 922 horse-drawn carts.
　　Regarding the task of state-owned transportation enterprises, Director Zhu pointed out that in the past, they had undertaken huge military transportation tasks in supporting the front and had consistently worked for the government's financial and grain allocation, and achieved considerable success. In the future, we should strengthen the unity and leadership of private transportation companies to serve the development of urban and rural material exchanges, and must pay attention to the excellent quality of state-owned enterprises, such as complying with transportation policies. In the past, only financial tasks were completed and profits were expanded, but the achievements in economic tasks were less. In the future, economic tasks and financial tasks should be organically combined.

　　He also pointed out that transportation companies in various places cannot be completely separated from the leadership of the local Party, government, and labor unions. Facts have proved that if the Party, government, and labor union leadership in the location of our company is sound, the work of the company will also be driven. For example, democratic management in Shijiazhuang, Taihang, and Tianjin has been developed to some extent. Political leadership is an important guarantee for business leadership. This cannot be ignored.

　　Regarding the highway freight rate policy, he put forward three principles: 1. Stable and strive for a consistent policy (stable means fixed within a considerable period of time). 2. Take care of the interests of both industrialists and businessmen and transportation operators. 3. Take into account the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas and economic tasks. Regarding accounting issues, he pointed out that the issues that need to be studied are: the standard cost problem, the cost calculation method problem, and how to reduce costs.

　　华北公路运输总局
  　经理会计会议开幕
    【本报讯】华北公路运输总局经理会计联席会议于十六日在平开幕。到有该局运输处及直属六个运输公司，六个区公司的经理及会计部门主要负责人等四十余人。会议主要解决的问题为：成本计算、运价政策、客货联运、会计科目、会计报表、执行预算制度及会计内部手续问题。华北公路总局曹承宗局长在致词中指出：今后公路运输事业必须走向正规化，逐步实行计划运输。运输处朱田顺处长作上半年各公司工作总结报告。他说，华北运输业务重点已由支援前线转入商运，为促进城乡物资交流，必须团结私营运输公司，共同发展运输事业，但同时还要向他们的投机性质不良作风（如无原则的涨落票价、骗钱、拐带等）作斗争。今年三月交通会议批判了单纯追求商业利润的偏向，一般公司都逐渐重视了运输业务，如去年商运毛利占百分之七十一点二，今年（根据邯郸、石门、侯马、太行等公司统计）占百分之四十七点六一。但是我们又忽略了为组织回运与扩大运输的经营商业的必要性，后来已很快纠正了，并经财委会批准了这种经营商业。由于全体职工的努力，我们的班车行驶路线已有三十五条，共计五○五六公里，占华北能行驶公路九○八四公里的百分之五十五点七；建立的货栈与售票站已有六十八个；运输能力约计二六○一公吨；能行驶的汽车有六一二辆，马车九二二辆。
    关于国营运输事业的任务问题，朱处长指出过去在支前上曾担负了庞大的军运任务，而且一贯地为政府的财粮调度而工作，并获得了相当的成绩。今后应加强团结和领导私营运输公司为发展城乡物资交流而服务，并必须注意国营事业的优良品质，如遵守运输政策等。在过去只完成了财政任务，扩大利润，但在经济任务方面的成绩较少。今后应使经济任务与财政任务有机地结合起来。
    他并指出各地运输公司不能完全脱离当地党政工的领导。事实证明：我们公司所在地党政工领导健全的话，公司工作亦被带动起来，如石家庄、太行及平津等地的民主管理即有所开展。政治领导为业务领导的重要保证。这是不能忽视的。
    关于公路运价政策，他提出三点原则性的意见：一、稳定的与争取一致的政策（稳定的意思即是在相当时间内的固定性）。二、照顾工商业者与运输业者双方的利益。三、顾及城乡物资交流与经济任务。关于会计上的问题，他指明需要研究的有：标准成本问题、成本计算方法问题和如何减低成本问题。
