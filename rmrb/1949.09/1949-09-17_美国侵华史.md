　　American Aggression Against China
    Liu Danian
  　　　　　III. Striving for Hegemony in China (Continued from XVIII)
    This continuous series of victories further expanded America's aggressive plans. At the time, Germany was propagating the danger of collapse due to the economic crisis. The United States, deeply fearing that it would lose a pillar against the Soviet Union as a result, felt obligated to find a way out for Germany. Professor Monroe of Columbia University drafted a plan and sent it to the State Department: Germany would supply "construction" materials to Chiang Kai-shek, and the price of these materials would be Germany's repayment of reparations to Britain and France, which would then be transferred to Britain and France to repay America's war debts. Finally, the United States would transfer the accounts as loans to China. (Note: The Eastern Miscellany, Vol. 28, No. 16.) This would not only help Germany avoid collapse, allowing it to continue to oppose the Soviet Union, but also strengthen American power in China to compete with Japan for dominance. This is another typical example of the close combination of American anti-Sovietism and aggression against China. However, this plan itself was very complicated, and Britain and France also disagreed. Therefore, it was changed to a proposal by American silver mining capitalist Pittman (Senator and Vice Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee) to lend 100,000 ounces of raw silver to Chiang Kai-shek. In addition, President Hoover (Harbert Clark Hoover) announced a "one-year postponement of international debt repayments by all countries" (Note: Declaration of June 20, 1931, implemented from July 1 of the same year, The Eastern Miscellany, Vol. 28, No. 17.) to fill the anti-Soviet deployment omitted as a result. When the Pittman Act was passed by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, it stipulated that China should be transformed into a purely colonial "tail end of American surplus production" "within a certain number of years" (Note: The full text is published in the Guowen Weekly, Vol. 8, No. 16.) and sent Lin Baile's son, Lin Baike, specifically to China to negotiate raw silver loans. Lin contacted Chiang Kai-shek in February 1931, and in early March, he met with Zhang Xueliang in Shenyang to revive and expand the American railway plan in the Northeast, preparing to build a parallel line to the South Manchuria Railway and continue the construction of Huludao military port, in order to involve the joint action of the new banking syndicate, which had not yet been finalized. At this time, Japan launched another more extensive separatist movement, which included a large number of new and old warlords, large and small, to confront the American plan. Chiang Kai-shek quickly defeated Shi Yousan, who launched the first attack in July of that year, and other places also stopped after a period of undercurrents. Although the American raw silver loan did not materialize, its "unification" movement achieved its third effect.
    Seeing that the European powers and the United States were busy dealing with the issues caused by the domestic economic crisis and did not have more power to stop Japan's activities, Japan launched the "September 18th Incident" on September 18 of the same year, when Japanese troops occupied Shenyang and quickly expanded to major cities and transportation lines in the Northeast.
    The sudden occurrence of the "September 18th Incident" gave the United States a considerable shock, but the US government quickly determined its policy on the incident. As early as two years ago, the United States had once advocated that Chiang Kai-shek openly sell the three northeastern provinces to Japan. American steel magnate Carnegie also funded a group of journalists with the "World Peace Foundation" to "travel" to China and Japan to create public opinion, saying: "China may not have the power to control this vast area. Moreover, the conflict of interests between China, Japan, and Russia will inevitably lead to war, and the final victor will control the power of Manchuria and Mongolia... Therefore, if China is wise, it should sell this part of China to Japan and devote the money it receives to rectifying domestic affairs..." (Note: The Eastern Miscellany, Vol. 26, No. 18.) The intention of the United States was to enhance Japan's anti-Soviet position, let Japan conflict with the Soviet Union, and the United States could benefit from both sides. At the same time, it would concentrate Japan's strength in managing the Northeast, reducing obstacles to the United States in the mainland, so that it could independently dispose of the Chinese mainland. When the "September 18th Incident" occurred, Japan, represented by its ambassador to the United States, discussed a secret US-Japan treaty with US Secretary of State Stimson. Japan proposed that the United States allow "non-interference in the Manchurian Incident," and Japan would allow the United States to "negotiate anything" in China. (Note: Westel W. Willoughby, Foreign Rights and Interests in China.) The US government knew that it would not be beneficial to have Chiang Kai-shek engage in military confrontation with Japan at this time. Comparing the Japanese proposal with the US's own policy towards the Northeast two years ago, the only difference was that it could further obtain Japan's recognition in the treaty. The United States might as well completely abandon all its historical plans to acquire the Northeast in exchange for Japan attacking the Soviet Union, and then use the Soviet Union's strength to weaken Japan, so that the United States could finally obtain hegemony in China. Therefore, it fully agreed to the conditions proposed by Japan, only adding one point: Japanese military occupation should be limited to north of Jinzhou, and should not go further south to hinder American rights. This was also one of the purposes of the United States' cession of Manchuria two years ago. After the secret treaty was established, the US policy towards the "September 18th Incident" was to thoroughly help Japan occupy Northeast China.

　　美国侵华史
    刘大年
  　　　　　三　争夺中国霸权　（续十八）
    此种连续胜利，使美国侵略计划更加扩大。时德国正宣传有因经济危机引起崩溃的危险，美国深恐因此失去一个反苏中坚，有义务替德国寻找一条出路，哥伦比亚大学教授孟禄遂起草一项计划送于国务院，由德国向蒋介石供给“建设”材料，把这批材料的价格作为德国偿付英法赔款，再转为英法偿付美国的战债，最后由美国转帐为对华贷款。（注：东方杂志二八卷一六号。）这样既可帮助德国避免崩溃，使它能继续反苏，又能加强美国在中国实力，以与日本争霸，是美国反苏与侵略中国紧相结合的又一个典型例子。但此计划本身很复杂，英法亦不同意，不得已，改用美国银矿业资本家毕德门（参议员兼外委会副主席）的提案，以生银十万盎斯贷与蒋介石，另由胡佛（Ｈａｒｂｅｒｔ．Ｃｌａｒｋ．Ｈｏｏｖｅｒ）总统宣布“各国国际债款延期一年偿付”（注：一九三一年六月二十日宣言，同年七月一日起实行，东方杂志二八卷一七号。）填补因此遗漏的反苏部署。毕德门案在上院外交委员会通过时，规定要于“若干年内”把中国变成单纯“美国过剩生产之尾闾”的殖民地（注：全文载国闻周报，八卷一六期。）并派林百乐的儿子林百克专门来中国接洽生银借款。林于一九三一年二月与蒋介石接头，又于三月初到沈阳会见张学良，复活并扩大美国在东北的铁路计划，准备修筑南满路并行线及续修葫芦岛军港，以牵连到新银行团联合行动，尚未最后决定。日本于此时发动了一个范围更广泛的再一次分裂运动，除汪精卫当然参加外，还包括大批新旧大小军阀，以与美国计划对抗。蒋介石于是年七月又迅速把首先发难的石友三打垮，其他各地经过一度暗潮后也都停止。美国生银借款虽未实现，它的“统一”运动却第三次收到效果。
    日本看见欧洲列强和美国正在忙于应付国内因经济危机所引起的事情，没有更多的力量来阻止日本的活动，遂于是年九月十八日，日军攻占沈阳，很快扩展至东北各主要城市和交通线，成为“九一八”事变。
    “九一八”突然发生，曾给美国以相当震动，但美政府很快确定了对此事件的政策。远在两年以前，美国曾一度主张蒋介石公开把东三省卖给日本，美国钢铁大王卡耐奇还为此以“世界和平基金”资遣一个记者团来中国和日本“游历”，制造舆论，说是：“中国对此广大地区未必有力控制之，不宁惟是，中日俄三国间之利益冲突势必引起战争，将于最后战胜者以操纵满蒙之权……故中国若贤明者，应将中国此部分出卖与日本，而将所得之钱致力于整顿内政……”（注：东方杂志二六卷一八号。）美国的用意是要增强日本反苏地位，让日本与苏联冲突，美国可两面取利，同时使日本集中力量经营东北，减少在内地对美阻挠，它自己好单独处分中国内地。及“九一八”事变发生时，日本以驻美大使为代表与美国务卿史汀生商谈一个美日秘密条约，日本提案为美国允许“不与闻满洲事变”，日本则允许美国在中国“什么事都好商量”（注：美根西·莱特美国人对远东问题的看法。）美政府知道这时再由蒋介石与日本作军事对抗决非有利，把日本提案与两年前美国自己对东北政策相比，所不同的，是进一步能获得日本在条约上承认，美国不如把历史上一切取得东北计划完全放弃，换取日本去进攻苏联，再用苏联力量削弱日本，从而使美国最后获得中国霸权，故对日本所提条件完全同意，只是附加一点：日本军事占领应限于锦州以北，不要再往南妨害了美国权利，这也是两年前，美国出让满洲目的之一。秘约成立后，美国对“九一八”事件的政策，便是彻底帮助日本占领中国的东北。
