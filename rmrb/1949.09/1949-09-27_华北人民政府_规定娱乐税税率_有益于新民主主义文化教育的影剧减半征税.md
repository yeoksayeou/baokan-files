　　North China People's Government
    Stipulates Entertainment Tax Rate
    Theaters and Films Beneficial to New Democratic Culture and Education to be Taxed at Half Rate
    [Ping City News] The current entertainment tax is difficult to standardize due to different conditions in each city. In order to take into account the actual situation, the North China People's Government issued an order on the 24th of this month to change the entertainment tax rate to 20% to 30% ad valorem. Except for Beijing and Tianjin, which will continue to be taxed at 30%, other small and medium-sized cities may, according to local conditions, have the provincial tax bureau make specific regulations within the prescribed tax rate, announce and implement them, and report them to the North China Taxation Bureau for record. Dance halls will be taxed at a uniform rate of 50%. The following incentive measures are stipulated for dramas and films with programs that are beneficial to new democratic culture and education: 1. All public and private troupes whose performances embody the significance of promoting new democratic culture and education shall have their entertainment tax reduced by half of the tax payable. 2. If programs that meet the aforementioned tax reduction regulations are performed on the same stage as programs that should not be reduced, the entertainment tax shall be reduced by one-third of the tax payable. 3. All government organizations, groups, and schools that organize entertainment soirees without occupying commercial entertainment venues shall be exempt from entertainment tax; otherwise, they will be treated the same as general businesses. 4. For tax-reduced entertainment programs, an application must be submitted to the local government-designated cultural management agency for review and approval five days before the performance, and a review certificate must be issued. For each performance of an approved program, the troupe shall submit the certificate to the local tax authority for verification and tax reduction one day before the performance. 5. The above provisions shall be implemented from the date of the order. All current temporary measures in various places that conflict with these measures shall be repealed. (Huaxin Office)
