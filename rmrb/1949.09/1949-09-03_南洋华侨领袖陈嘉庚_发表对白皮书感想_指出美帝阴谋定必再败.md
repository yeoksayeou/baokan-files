　　【Our Newspaper News】Nanyang Overseas Chinese leader Mr. Chen Jiageng recently published his thoughts on the White Paper released by the U.S. State Department as follows:
    While traveling, I read in the Northeast Daily the denunciations by several representatives of the New Political Consultative Conference in Beiping against the U.S. imperialist White Paper, and I learned that this book is a self-justifying confession of its past interference in our country's internal affairs. It is a pity that I could not read its contents in full at the time! However, based on the quoted remarks from various criticisms, it has fully exposed its hideous features of deceiving the world, stealing reputation, being fierce, cunning, and shameless. Not only has it reversed right and wrong in the past, confused black and white to slander the Chinese people, but it also has continuous conspiracies and tricks in the future to obstruct China's great cause of construction. The White Paper's admission of errors and failures does not show any remorse towards the Chinese people, but rather uses flowery words to defend itself, shifting responsibility to Chiang Kai-shek. On the other hand, it feigns benevolence and righteousness, devising various insidious strategies to continue its acts of aggression, in order to win the favor of Wall Street tycoons. The United States is not without conscientious and rational people who will not be deceived by it. How can it deceive people all over the world with this? I privately believe that if Roosevelt had not died, the United States might not have harbored such insatiable ambitions. However, Truman and his gang believe that Germany and Italy suffered disastrous defeats, and Britain and France are weakened. Other small countries will also declare poverty and follow the lead of the United States. Only the Soviet Union, with its vast territory and population, has suffered great losses in the war but is recovering rapidly, and its socialist construction has achieved outstanding results, which clashes with U.S. imperialism. In Asia, the Philippines was originally a protectorate, and Japan and South Korea are occupied. If such a large country as China, which borders the Soviet Union, can be brought under control, then all countries in the East and West can be commanded by us to encircle and suppress the Soviet Union and eliminate it. From then on, the sons and grandsons of Wall Street tycoons will enjoy endless happiness. Therefore, they are ambitious and resort to all kinds of cunning plans. Truman and his gang know very well that their lackey, Chiang Kai-shek, has been in power for more than 20 years, betraying the people, being corrupt and dictatorial, and tyrannical, making people live in misery. However, the Yan'an regime, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, sets an example, loves the people like children, so the people have abundant food and clothing, and live and work in peace and contentment. The difference between good and evil is obvious, and right and wrong are clear. The world knows this. However, U.S. imperialism has lost its conscience, extinguished humanity, used money to help the wicked, used the excuse of mediation, but in reality, it fully armed the Kuomintang army, helped with a large number of airplanes, tanks and other weapons, and sent troops and ships to escort them to attack the Japanese-occupied cities surrounded by the People's Liberation Army, and instigated the Japanese puppet troops to cooperate with the Kuomintang army in combat, resulting in the outbreak of the Chinese civil war, in order to achieve its great conspiracy to dominate the world. In the autumn of 1946, I, in the name of the chairman of the South Seas Federation of Relief Associations in Singapore, sent a telegram to U.S. President Truman and his Senate and House of Representatives, U.S. Special Envoy to Nanjing Marshall, and U.S. Ambassador Stuart, stating that Japan used to use loans and military supplies to promote China's division, which eventually led to the catastrophe of World War II. This kind of ambition to harm others, benefit oneself, and conquer the world will eventually fail. Treachery will be punished. Chiang Kai-shek is corrupt, autocratic, cunning, untrustworthy, and uses officials who are corrupt and engage in private gain, with a notorious reputation, people's livelihood suffering, and law and discipline being swept away. He is昏庸老朽 and certainly cannot be talked about in terms of reform. Your country's aid to the rebel Chiang government has fueled the Chinese civil war. The democratic politics of the CCP are deeply rooted, and any external money, weapons, or oppression will be ineffective. Please take Japan as a lesson and do not mistakenly believe that force can destroy justice and that treachery can deceive the world. This telegram was a warning three years ago, but the United States, which has blindly aided Chiang Kai-shek, has been greatly defeated and despised and ridiculed by the whole world. Its heart has not died, and it has formed the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in Europe, and sent crab soldiers and shrimp soldiers to plan the Pacific Alliance in Asia. It is a cunning scheme, hoping that the embers will rekindle. However, the European countries are scarred and riddled with wounds, and who would be willing to sacrifice for it? It is nothing more than economic reasons that lead them to collude with it and engage in the Cold War. Since the liberation of Northeast China, North China, and Central China, our military discipline has been strict, public security has been good, workers and peasants have been diligent, and public officials have been honest, which is widely praised. I have been to Tianjin and the Northeast for three months, traveling thousands of kilometers, through more than a dozen famous cities, and visited the responsible authorities in various places. Most of the officials are sincere, humble, courteous, and diligent, without the bad habits of bureaucracy, and have the optimistic atmosphere of Yan'an in those years. Along the way, the fields are not only free of weeds, but the farmers are still diligently cultivating and nurturing. I have not seen this in my hometown of Nanyang. The main reason is also the success of land reform. Visiting various factories and investigating daily wages, most of them are based on the local price of goods. Ordinary workers, in addition to their own living expenses, still have more than half of their wages to support their families. Their lives are stable and their work is diligent. However, the management is slightly inexperienced due to the recent takeover. In addition, the Kuomintang's sabotage and the cost of repairs are quite high, which inevitably affects the cost, but this is also a temporary phenomenon. It has not been a year since liberation, and many things have been done. It is really commendable. The People's United Government will be established soon, and our splendid new national flag will fly all over the country. A comprehensive victory is imminent, and the people are unprecedentedly united, and their strength is growing. U.S. imperialism uses my bandits as running dogs, and the White Paper covers up its mistakes and its ambition has not died. It will undoubtedly be defeated again in harming our country.

  　发表对白皮书感想
  　指出美帝阴谋定必再败
    【本报讯】南洋华侨领袖陈嘉庚氏，顷发表对美国国务院所公布的白皮书的感想如下：
    在旅行中，阅东北日报刊载北平新政协代表多位对于美帝国主义白皮书之指斥，知该书为饰词掩盖其历来干涉我国内政之供词，惜一时未能尽读其内容为憾！但就各方指斥之引用语，已充分暴露其欺世盗名凶诈无耻之狰狞面目，不惟过去颠倒是非，混淆黑白，以诬蔑中国人民，并且将来尚有不断之阴谋狡计，以阻挠中国建设之大业。白皮书之自招错误与失败，并无对中国人民悔罪，而是花言巧语为自己辩护，推诿责任于蒋介石，另一面则假仁假义，想出种种阴险之策略，以继续其侵略之行为，借以博取华尔街大亨辈之欢心。美国不乏有良心有理智之人士，定不受其欺骗，而欲以此欺骗全世界人士，其可得乎？余窃以为罗斯福不死，美国或不作得陇望蜀之野心。唯杜鲁门及其一伙，以为德意惨败，英法削弱，其他小国，亦将报穷，当以美国马首是瞻。独苏联地广人众，战争损失虽大，恢复迅速，社会主义建设，成绩优异，与美帝国主义相抵触。亚洲方面，菲岛原为保护国，日韩则被占领，偌大中国，又与苏联接壤，倘能取得控制权，则东西各国，由我指挥，夹攻苏联，将其消灭，从此统治世界，华尔街大亨之子子孙孙，坐享无穷幸福，故野心勃勃，狡计百出。杜鲁门及其一伙，明知其走狗蒋介石，执政二十余年，背叛人民，贪污独裁，凶残横行，民不聊生。而延安政权在毛主席领导下，以身作则，爱民若赤，故人民丰衣足食，安居乐业。善恶悬殊，是非显著，世界咸知。乃美帝国主义丧尽天良，绝灭人道，利用金钱，助纣为虐，借词调解，而实际则全力武装国民党军队，帮助大量飞机坦克及其他武器，派兵派舰护送，以攻击被解放军包围之日占领之城市，并嗾使日伪军队，配合国民党军作战，致爆发中国内战，以遂其独霸世界之大阴谋。余于一九四六年秋，在新加坡以南侨总会主席名义，致电美国总统杜鲁门及其参众两院，南京美特使马歇尔，美大使司徒雷登等，略谓日本昔以借款军火，助长中国分裂，卒致世界大战惨祸，此种损人利己征服世界野心，最后仍遭失败，奸险灭理，报应不爽。蒋介石腐败专断，狡诈无信，任用官吏，贪污营私，声名狼藉，民生痛苦，法纪荡然，昏庸老朽，断不足与言改革。贵国援助民贼蒋政府，助长中国内战。而中共民主政治，根深蒂固，任何外来金钱武器压迫，亦必无效。请以日本为前车之鉴，勿再误信武力可灭公理，奸谋可欺世界。此电警告，于今三年，而昧良援助蒋介石之美国，已大败特败，为全世界鄙视耻笑，心尚未死，在欧洲组北大西洋公约，在亚洲亦遣蟹兵虾卒谋太平洋联盟，奸谋诡计，冀死灰复燃。但欧洲诸国，疮痍满目，谁肯为其牺牲，无非因经济故，与之勾搭，从事冷战而已。我国自东北，华北及华中解放，军纪严明，治安良好，工农勤奋，公务人员廉洁，有口皆碑。余来平津及东北已阅三月，行数千公里，历十余名城，访问过各地负责当局，官员大都诚恳虚怀，谦恭勤奋，无官僚之陋习，有如延安当年乐观之气象，沿途所见田畴，不但杂草尽除，农民仍勤锄培养，余在故乡南洋所未见，要亦土地改革成功，为其主因。参观各工厂，调查每日工资，多以地方物品时价为标准，普通工人，除自身生活费外，尚余大半可供家用，生活安定，工作勤劳。惟管理方面，因接办未久，经验略差，加以国民党破坏，修建费用颇多，不免影响成本，然亦一时现象。解放未及一年，百废多举，实难能可贵。不日人民联合政府成立，我灿烂之新国旗，飘扬全国，全面胜利在即，人民空前团结，力量日趋伟大。美帝国主义利用我蟊贼为鹰犬，及白皮书之饰非文过，野心不死，祸害我国，定必再败无疑也。
