【Chahar News】 The destruction of the Pangjiabao mine has profoundly educated cadres, Communist Party members, and the masses in Chahar Province. Cherishing the property of the people's motherland has become a mass movement in areas such as Longguan, Xuanhua, Huailai, and Wanquan. Since the People's Daily reported the destruction of the mine, the Xinhua News Agency published an editorial, and the North China People's Government issued a decision to reward or punish relevant personnel, the Chahar Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Provincial People's Government, in addition to leading the reward and punishment of relevant personnel, called on cadres throughout the province to study the above-mentioned documents, conduct self-criticism, and publicize to the masses. Significant results have been achieved so far. Around the Pangjiabao mine, 105 villages in Longguan and Xuanhua counties have established mine protection, railway protection, and line protection committees. The masses have been enthusiastically offering equipment. As of August 19th, the masses in areas and villages such as Dabaikou Dadaun in Xuanhua had offered more than 1,000 pieces of equipment, including two fan heads, drilling beds, papermaking machine parts, and electromagnetic platforms, as well as 126 tools and more than 200 jin of lubricating oil. The Huashaoying district of the county alone collected more than 600 pieces of various tools and machine parts, plus more than 10,000 jin of iron. Xuanhua City has established a material collection committee, and districts and streets have established material collection stations. In just three days in late August, twelve streets in three districts collected an electric alarm, 95 rails, six zhang of high-voltage wire, car heads, iron wire, water pipes, spikes and other equipment.

After studying the protection of state property, cadres throughout Huailai County used various publicity methods to mobilize the masses to offer industrial and mining equipment. Hu Shun, the town mayor of Huailai urban area, personally went to various places to inspect and mobilize. Within two days, the masses offered 317 pieces of equipment including tracks, splints, spikes, large and small water pipes, and iron plates, as well as 48 jin of iron wire and 1,248 jin of scrap iron.

    【察哈尔讯】庞家堡矿场被毁事件，深刻的教训了察哈尔省的干部、共产党员和群众。爱护人民祖国财产在龙关、宣化、怀来、万全等地区已经造成群众运动。自从人民日报记者报导该矿遭受破坏，新华社发表社论，华北人民政府发布惩奖有关人员的决定后，中共察哈尔省委及省人民政府，除领导惩奖有关人员外，并号召全省干部学习上述文件，进行检讨，并对群众进行宣传，至今已收显著效果。在庞家堡矿场周围，龙关、宣化两县所属的一百零五村中，均先后建立了护矿、护路、护线委员会。群众纷纷献交器材，宣化大坝口大段地等区、村群众，截至八月十九日已献出风机头两件、打眼床、造纸机零件、电磁台等机件千余件，工具一百二十六件，擦机油二百余斤。该县化稍营区即汇集各种工具、机器零件六百余件，另有铁万余斤。宣化市已成立搜集器材委员会，区、街成立了器材搜集站。仅八月下旬三天中，三个区十二个街即搜集电动警报机一部，铁轨九十五根，高压线六丈，汽车头、铁丝、自来水管、道钉及其他器材等多件。
    怀来全县干部进行保护国家财产的学习后，运用各种宣传方式，动员群众献交工矿器材。怀来城区镇长胡顺亲到各地检查动员，群众两天内即献交出道轨、夹板、道钉、大小水管、铁板等三百一十七件，铁丝四十八斤，碎铁一千二百四十八斤。
