　　Henan Provincial Government Invites People from All Walks of Life to a Symposium
　　Labor and peasant representatives express their determination to build an industrialized China with a hundredfold effort.
　　[Special dispatch from our correspondent in Kaifeng, 24th] The enthusiasm of the people of all strata in Henan Province in celebrating the founding of the People's Republic of China is continuing to grow. In addition to reading and studying Chairman Mao's opening speech countless times, various symposiums have been held. At the symposium hosted by the provincial government, people recalled the bitter days of the past amid cheers. Ms. Zhou Xiaopei from the educational field tearfully spoke of the suffering of the 30 million people of Henan, who had endured all kinds of exploitation and disasters, were displaced, and lost their families for decades. Geologist Zhang Renjian spoke with great indignation about an incident where a store owner in a foreign shop said that Chinese people were not worthy of wearing those glasses. But today, in the era when the independent, free, and happy People's Republic of China has been proclaimed, everyone is exhilarated and encouraged. Tian Feng, a man in his sixties, said, "This old man has been dying along with the old China since 7 p.m. on the 21st, and I was born with the birth of a free and happy China." At the beginning of this era of Chinese people's history, everyone expressed their determination to meet the heavy responsibility of national construction through work and study. Song Chuan, a representative of the trade union, said: "We must quickly organize the workers of Henan within a year, redouble our efforts, and build an industrialized China from the existing dilapidated industrial base." Zhang Baiyuan, Vice President of Henan University, said: "Scientists, artists, and cultural workers should follow the path indicated by Chairman Mao and strive to build and consolidate the People's Republic of China." Staff members of the People's Government stated: "We guarantee to implement all the resolutions and programs of the CPPCC 100 percent, and carry out various construction tasks under the leadership of the Central People's Government." At various symposiums of troops and workers, people were celebrating with the same feelings.

    【本报记者开封二十四日专电】河南各阶层人民庆祝中华人民共和国开国盛典的情绪，正在继续发展着。除了无数遍的朗读与研讨毛主席的开幕词，并召开了各种座谈会。在省政府主持的各界座谈会上，人民在欢庆声中，回忆起过去苦难的日子。教育界周筱沛女士说到河南三千万人民几十年来受尽种种剥削、灾难，流离失所、家破人亡时，悲痛的流下泪来。地质学家张人鉴，谈到一次在外国商店配眼镜，店主说：中国人不配戴这眼镜时非常痛愤。但在今天独立自由幸福的中华人民共和国已宣告成立的时代，大家又欢欣鼓舞了。六十多岁的田丰厅长说，我这老头子已从二十一日下午七时起，随着古老的中国死亡，也随着自由幸福的中国诞生而诞生。在这中国人民时代历史的开始时，大家纷纷表示要以工作学习来迎接建国的重任。工会代表宋川说：要在一年以内，迅速组织起河南的工人来，加倍努力，从现有破烂的工业基础上，建设起一个工业的中国。河南大学张柏园副校长表示：科学家、艺术家、文化工作者，应该走毛主席指示的道路，为建设与巩固中华人民共和国而奋斗。人民政府的工作人员表示：保证人民政协的一切决议纲领，百分之百地执行，并在中央人民政府领导之下，进行各种建设工作。在部队的、工人的各种座谈会上，均以同样的心情在庆祝着。
