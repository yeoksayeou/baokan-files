　　Public Security Bureau First Outer District Branch
  　Arrests a Batch of Gold and Silver Smugglers
    [This Municipality News] The Public Security Bureau's First Outer District Branch of Ping City, on August 31st, in the Qianwai Juxingcheng Bank, Wupailou, and Rou Shi (Meat Market) areas, arrested multiple gold and silver smugglers disrupting the financial markets. The aforementioned three areas have long been distribution points for illegally trading gold, silver, US dollars, and Northeast currency. Since the liberation of Ping City half a year ago, under the education and influence of the People's Government's lenient policies, most gold and silver smugglers have already changed professions. However, there are still a small number of lawbreakers who disregard government decrees and continue to engage in activities that disrupt the financial markets, some even openly clamoring to buy and sell gold and silver. In order to implement the resolutions of the Ping City All-Circles Representatives Conference, the First Outer District Branch of the Public Security Bureau dispatched a large number of cadres and police officers on August 31st to arrest and detain all the gold and silver smugglers who frequently operate in the aforementioned three areas, except for a few who escaped. Among the 67 detainees, excluding individual merchants who were mistakenly arrested and released after explanation, 13 had gold rings, US dollars, Northeast currency (more than 4 million), and other physical evidence on their persons. More than 30 were gold and silver smugglers specializing in illegally trading gold and silver, and the rest were small-amount gold and silver offenders or occasional offenders, all of whom have confessed without denying. Currently, the First Outer District Branch has handled them separately according to the severity of their cases. Those who dare to engage in illegal activities of smuggling gold and silver again will be severely punished.
