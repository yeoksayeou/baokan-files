　　New Soviet Scientific Inventions
　　　New Type Locomotive
　　All the staff of the Kharkov factory, which belongs to the Soviet transport machine manufacturing industry, have begun to use the new internal combustion engine locomotive.
　　It is a locomotive combining two control machines with a driver's office. Its power is two thousand horsepower, twice as much as ordinary mainline internal combustion engine locomotives. The internal combustion engine locomotive can smoothly carry both freight and passenger trains. The first test run demonstrated the excellent quality of this locomotive. During the experimental internal combustion engine operation, no push cars were used, and a train carrying one thousand two hundred tons was used, the original amount being one thousand five hundred tons.
　　Automatic Delinting Textile Machine
　　The textile factory of the Kirov Silk Weaving United Factory in Leningrad, Soviet Union, has recently invented a new type of automatic delinting textile machine. Small tracks are laid on a row of textile machines, which are temporary electrical conductors and electrical good conductors. A small combined machine consisting of a reducer, a motor and a ventilation mechanism is installed on it. When the machine rotates along the small track, it regularly blows cotton lint, and the lint falls onto the textile machine during weaving. In the past, female textile workers cleaned the lint on the machines themselves, and they also had to do this manually. The female workers wasted a lot of time blowing the textile machines. This automatic delinting textile machine saves female textile workers a lot of time and speeds up work efficiency.
　　The Kirov United Factory has begun to widely apply the cotton lint blowing machine to all workshops of the textile factory.
　　All-Metal Passenger Car
　　The Lianozo Car Manufacturing Factory near Moscow and the Yegorov Factory in Leningrad have begun to produce newly designed all-metal passenger cars. These two factories have learned to produce such cars in a very short period of time.
　　These all-metal cars have been formed into a long passenger train, and are already running on the routes from Moscow to Boli, Moscow to Chelyabinsk, Moscow to Riga, and other routes.
　　The design of the carriages has been greatly improved compared with the shape of the carriages manufactured before. The steam heating system has been improved. And attention has been paid to the great convenience of passengers, and the interior of the carriages has been installed. For the convenience of passengers placing luggage, there is a large box above the seats.
　　Because of the start of production of new-style carriages in these two factories, all the workshops have been transformed. Many equipments have been replaced, many complete transfer machines have been built, and advanced industries are being used.
　　Freight Car with High Load Capacity
　　All the staff of the experimental workshop of the Urals Stalin Automobile Factory in Chelyabinsk Province have transformed the old-style freight car into a "3NC-5" style freight car. The results of the factory's test of the freight car are excellent.
　　The characteristic of the new freight machine is its high load-bearing capacity. Its generator is moved to the front. Therefore, the goods on the frame can be evenly installed. This can increase the length of the car body and increase the volume by 0.3 cubic meters. There are three positions in the front of the freight car.

　　苏联科学新发明
  　新式火车头
    苏联运输机器制造业所属的哈尔科夫工厂全体工作人员已开始使用新的内燃机关车。
    它是带有一个司机处的两个管制机结合的火车头。它的威力是两千马力，较比普通干线上的内燃机关车多两倍。内燃机关车可以很顺利地拉载商品和旅客列车。第一次试车就说明了这种火车头的优良质量。在实验内燃机关的时候，并没有用推车，一列车上装了一千二百吨，原定数额为一千五百吨。
    自动去绒纺织机
    苏联的列宁格勒基洛夫丝织联合工厂之纺织工厂新近发明了一种新式自动去绒纺织机。它是在一列的纺织机上边铺上了小轨道，这就是暂时的电气的明引及电气良导体，在这上面安置有一个不大的由减速装置、摩托机和通风机构成的联合机。当机器沿着小轨道转动的时候，就有规律地吹着棉绒，在进行纺织的时候，绒就落到纺织机上去了。从前，女纺织机工人们自己进行清扫机器上的机绒，同时，他们还要做这手工。女工人们为了吹纺织机浪费了很多时间。这自动去绒纺织机使女纺织工人们省去了很多时间并加速了工作效率。
    基洛夫联合工厂已开始能广泛地把吹棉绒机运用到纺织工厂各车间去。
    全金属客车
    在莫斯科附近之里安诺造夫车厢制造工厂和列宁格勒的耶高罗夫工厂已经开始出产新设计的全金属的客车厢。这两个工厂在很短的期间内就学会了生产这样的车厢了。
    这全金属车厢已排成一列很长的旅客列车，已在莫斯科至伯力，莫斯科至齐略宾斯克，莫斯科至里加的及其他路线上行驶着。
    车厢的设计较之以前所制造的车厢的形状是大大改进了。改进了暖汽的体系。并注意到了旅客们的极大方便，进行了车厢内部的装设。为了旅客们放置行李的便利在坐位上面作有一个很大的箱子。
    在这两个工厂内由于开始生产新式的车厢，各车间都统统进行了改造。改换了许多装备，建设了许多完整的转运机，运用着先进的工业。
    有高度载重能力的运货车
    在齐略宾斯克省乌拉尔斯大林汽车厂实验车间的全体工作人员已将旧式的运货车改造成“３ＮＣ—５”式样的运货车。该货车工厂内试验的成绩极佳。
    新式运货机的特点，便是高度的载重能力。将其发电机移在前面。因此，就能使脚架上的货物平均装置。这样可以增加车体的长度提高容积零点三立方公尺，运货车的前面有三个人的位置。
