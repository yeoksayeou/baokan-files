　　Ping Department Store Branch Supports the Cigarette Industry
  　Regularly and Quantitatively Exchanges for Finished Products
    Contract Signed with Private Dazhong Cigarette Factory
    [This City News] In order to systematically purchase cigarettes and support the private cigarette industry, the Department Store Branch of the Municipal Trading Company signed an ordering contract with Dazhong Tobacco Factory on the 1st of this month as a preliminary experiment, with plans to gradually promote it after gaining experience. In the past, the company's acquisition of finished products from various cigarette factories was all based on what was available, without fixed brands, quantities, or exchange ratios, which affected sales and did not actively support the production of tobacco factories. Now, a one-month contract has been signed with Dazhong Cigarette Factory to exchange for 240 cartons of "Mei Fei" brand cigarettes. Through the regular and quantitative exchange work, they will understand how to reduce costs, improve quality, and open up sales channels, in order to formulate plans, renew contracts, and broadly support other cigarette factories. The contract stipulates that the exchange ratio is one pack of cigarettes for 1.9 jin of tobacco leaves, or, if converted to cash, it will be issued at 90% of the Department Store's "Mei Fei" brand cigarette price. This time, 150 cartons of cigarettes are exchanged for tobacco leaves, and 90 cartons of cigarettes are converted to cash. In order to ensure that the quality has certain specifications, the company has specifically designated samples and checks the goods according to the samples upon receipt. Substandard products will not be accepted. Since signing this contract, both the capitalists and workers of Dazhong Cigarette Factory have been actively producing. Before the contract was signed, there were difficulties in capital turnover and a lack of raw materials, and the factory only operated for about ten days a month. Now, production has become normal, and there are no more shutdowns.

　　平百货分公司扶植卷烟业
  　定期定量换购成品
    已与私营大众烟厂签订合同
    【本市讯】市贸易公司百货分公司为有计划地收购纸烟，扶植私营卷烟业，已于本月一日和大众烟草工厂签订订货合同，作初步试验，取得经验后再逐步推广。该公司收购各烟厂成品过去全是随到随收，没有固定的牌号，数量和交换比率，影响销路，对扶植烟草工厂生产也未起积极作用。现和大众烟厂订立为期一个月的合同，换购“美妃”牌纸烟二百四十箱，从定期定量换购工作中，了解怎样做到降低成本，提高品质和打开销路，以便定出计划，续订合同，并广泛扶植其他各烟厂。合同中规定交换的比率是一条烟换一斤九两烟叶，如折现款即按百货公司“美妃”牌纸烟价九折发给，这次是一百五十箱烟换烟叶，九十箱烟折现款。该公司为使品质有一定规格，特定出样品，收货时按样品检查，不合格的不收。大众烟厂自订这次合同后，资方和工人均积极生产，未订合同前资金周转困难，缺乏原料，每月仅开工十天左右，现生产已趋正常，不再停工。
