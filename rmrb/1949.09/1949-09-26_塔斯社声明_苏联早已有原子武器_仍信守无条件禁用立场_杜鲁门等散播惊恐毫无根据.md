Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 25th: TASS Moscow, 24th: TASS statement, text as follows:

　　On September 23rd, U.S. President Truman declared: According to materials obtained by the U.S. government, an atomic explosion occurred in the Soviet Union sometime in the recent week. At the same time, the British and Canadian governments also issued similar statements.

　　After these statements were issued, newspapers in the United States, Britain, Canada, and other countries published many remarks spreading panic among the general public.

　　Therefore, TASS is hereby instructed to declare as follows: As is well known, large-scale construction work is underway in the Soviet Union, namely the construction of hydroelectric power stations, mines, canals, and highways. This construction work necessitates the extensive use of the latest technological means for explosions. Since these explosions have occurred and are occurring quite frequently in various regions of the country, this may attract the attention of countries outside the Soviet Union.

　　Regarding the production of atomic energy, TASS believes it is necessary to remind everyone of the fact that even on November 6, 1947, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov issued a statement about the secret of the atomic bomb, saying: "This secret no longer exists." This statement meant that the Soviet Union had already discovered the secret of atomic weapons at that time, and that it had this weapon available for its use at that time. Scientists in the United States of America believed that Molotov's statement was a bluff, and they thought that the Soviet Union would not be able to master atomic weapons until 1952, but they were wrong, because the Soviet Union had already discovered the secret of atomic weapons as early as 1947.

　　As for the panic spread by certain foreigners in this regard, this panic is absolutely groundless. It should be pointed out that although the Soviet government has atomic weapons available for its use, it adheres to and intends to continue to adhere to its original position of unconditionally prohibiting the use of atomic weapons.

　　As for the control of atomic weapons, it must be said that this control will be necessary to verify the implementation of the resolution prohibiting the production of atomic weapons.

### 塔斯社声明　苏联早已有原子武器　仍信守无条件禁用立场  杜鲁门等散播惊恐毫无根据

　　塔斯社声明
  　苏联早已有原子武器
  　仍信守无条件禁用立场     
    杜鲁门等散播惊恐毫无根据
    【新华社北平二十五日电】塔斯社莫斯科二十四日电，塔斯社声明，文如下：
    九月二十三日，美国总统杜鲁门宣称：据美国政府所获材料，最近某一星期曾有原子爆炸事情在苏联发生。与此同时，英国与加拿大政府也发表了类似的言论。
    这些声明发表后，美、英、加三国报纸以及其他国家的报纸即出现了许多在广大的公众当中散播惊恐的言论。
    为此，塔斯社兹奉令声明如下：如所周知，大规模的建设工作正在苏联进行中，这就是兴建水电站、矿山、运河与公路，这种建设工作使得必须大大使用最新式的技术手段进行爆炸。既然这些爆炸曾经和正在颇为频繁地在国内各个地区发生，因此这就有可能会引起苏联国外注意。
    至于生产原子能，塔斯社认为必须促使大家回忆这一事实，即甚至在一九四七年十一月六日，苏联外长莫洛托夫就曾发表关于原子弹秘密的声明，他说：“这一秘密早已不存在了”。这一声明意味着苏联那时业已寻找出了原子武器的秘密，而且那时就有了这一武器可供其使用。美利坚合众国的科学界人士，认为莫洛托夫这一声明是虚张声势，他们以为苏联在一九五二年以前，是不会能够掌握原子武器的，但他们错了，因为苏联早在一九四七年就已寻找出了原子武器的秘密。
    至于某些外国人士在这方面所散播的惊恐，这种惊恐是绝对毫无根据的。应当指出：虽然苏联政府有着原子武器可供其使用，但是，它信守着而且今后仍拟信守其原来的无条件禁止使用原子武器的立场。
    至于管制原子武器，必须说：这一管制对于检查履行这一禁止生产原子武器的决议来说，将是必须的。
