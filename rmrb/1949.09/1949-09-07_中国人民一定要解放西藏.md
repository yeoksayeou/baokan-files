　　The Chinese People Must Liberate Tibet
　　Dù Bō
　　The victorious development of the Chinese People's Liberation War is about to completely liberate all of China. The remaining forces of the Kuomintang reactionaries are about to be completely eliminated, and the imperialist aggressor forces, after suffering a shameful defeat, are plotting to divide and steal a part of China's territorial sovereignty. The US imperialism's instigation to annex Taiwan is one example, and the simultaneous exertion of aggression plots towards our border region of Tibet by the aggressors of the US, Britain, and India is another example. The recent "anti-communist" incident in Tibet fully exposes the embarrassing behavior of the imperialists attempting to divide Tibet, enslave the Tibetan people, and then stage a comeback to continue enslaving the Chinese people.
　　It is understandable and should be approved that the local authorities in Tibet expel the delegation of the bogus Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission dispatched to Tibet by the reactionary Kuomintang government. Because the reactionary Kuomintang government and all its representative organs are anti-people and are the common enemy of all ethnic groups in China. The Chinese people do not need such an anti-people government at all, and it is inevitable that the Tibetan people and Tibetan ethnic minorities despise it. The Chinese People's Liberation Army is also victoriously fighting to overthrow this reactionary rule and will soon achieve complete victory. However, the crux of the problem does not lie here, but through this incident, it fully exposes the ambition of imperialist schemers to use the dissatisfaction of the Tibetan people and Tibetan ethnic minorities with the erroneous ethnic discrimination policy of the reactionary Kuomintang government to provoke the relationship between Tibet and China, and to take advantage of the reactionary Kuomintang government being fragmented and the Chinese People's Liberation Army not yet reaching Tibet to seize the opportunity to steal Tibet, plunder China's territorial sovereignty, and implement "anti-communism," attempting to obstruct or delay the liberation of the Tibetan people and Tibetan ethnic minorities and continue to enslave our Tibetan people and Tibetan ethnic minorities. This is what the Chinese people resolutely oppose.
　　The aggressive ambitions of US and British imperialism towards Tibet are very clear. Almost simultaneously with this Tibetan incident, British imperialism, through the reactionary Nehru government of India, controlled the native states of Sikkim and Bhutan between India and Tibet. This action is threatening the Tibetan local authorities to further submit. At the same time, the head of the Indian mission in Tibet, the Englishman Richardson, who was originally scheduled to retire this year, suddenly announced an extension of his term for one year. Richardson is a fierce and sinister aggressive ambitionist who has been managing the British imperialist aggression against Tibet. The recent announcement of the extension of his term is very clear in its purpose. Not long ago, the Indian affairs official Dayal hurriedly went to Tibet to "investigate the incident," which even more clearly exposed the ambition of British imperialism to further control Tibet. US imperialism has expressed extreme "concern" about the recent developments in Tibet. On August 10, Washington diplomats specifically stated that the Tibetan business delegation that "visited" the United States in June last year had expressed to the United States its "willingness to trade with the United States." The notorious US imperialist spy radio commentator Thomas sneaked into Lhasa via Bangkok at the end of July, and his passport was issued by the Indian Nehru government. It goes without saying that whether it is British imperialism or US imperialism, they are using the Indian Nehru government as a tool to accelerate their steps to invade Tibet. The Indian "Lightning" newspaper clearly pointed out: "The Tibetan riots instigated by Britain and the United States are actually a conspiracy to make Tibet subordinate to Britain and the United States."
　　US and British imperialism have long coveted Tibet, and British imperialism's invasion began even earlier. Tibet is geographically close to India. After the British Empire seized India in 1762, Tibet, which bordered India, was regarded as an object of its aggression. Due to the corruption of the Manchu Qing government, the aggressive forces of the British Empire were able to take advantage of the situation to invade Tibet. The warlord melee in the early years of the Republic of China, and the subsequent corruption and incompetence of the reactionary Kuomintang government, all facilitated the development of the aggressive ambitions of British imperialism. US imperialism invaded Tibet during the Anti-Japanese War. At that time, the US imperialist air force came to China to fight, and opened the "Hump Route" from India to Kunming and Chongqing. Taking the opportunity, it sent its military spies to various parts of Tibet under the pretext of exploring routes, and established intelligence relations with the Tibetan local authorities. US aircraft often flew out of the航路 and flew over Tibet to make "some kind of communication connection." Later, the US military headquarters in China dispatched the spy Ilya Tolstoy to make a "journey through Tibet" and sneaked into Lhasa to carry out activities. The forces of US imperialism have since infiltrated Tibet. In June last year, the Tibetan local authorities sent their so-called business delegation to "visit" Washington and London, and talked about the issue of Tibet's "independence" in "business" gatherings. What is even stranger is that in this "business delegation," there was also a non-"business" military officer Sui Kang. When the delegation was in London, British Prime Minister Attlee personally met with them, which was certainly not an accidental or business-like "visit," but rather British and US imperialism intensifying their plotting of aggression against Tibet.
　　From the perspective of the internal contradictions of the Tibetan rulers, the opposition between the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama is its concentrated manifestation. The Panchen Lama and the Dalai Lama each have their own territories. The Panchen Lama is in charge of the Rear Tibet, and the Dalai Lama is in charge of the Former Tibet. In politics, the Panchen Lama is supported by the reactionary Kuomintang, while the Dalai Lama is attached to British and US imperialism. Putting aside religion, as a political idol for the reactionary Kuomintang and British and US imperialism to compete for the ruling power of Tibet and enslave the Tibetan people and ethnic minorities, the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama often turn against each other due to power. Due to the increasing influence of British imperialism in Tibet, the Panchen Lama was forced to flee Tibet in 1924 and went into exile in the Qinghai area. Twelve years ago, he was assassinated by his opponent. The new Panchen Lama is twelve years old and his name is Yu Bao Ci Dan. The Dalai Lama is also only thirteen years old and remains in Lhasa. Therefore, although the reactionary Kuomintang government has dispatched a bogus Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission delegation to Lhasa, it is only an empty organ.
　　However, no matter how ambitious British and US imperialism are towards Tibet, the Tibetan people and Tibetan ethnic minorities have always missed and looked up to the motherland. Although the erroneous ethnic policies of the Manchu Qing and the reactionary Kuomintang government have provoked opposition and dissatisfaction from the Tibetan ethnic minorities, all these reactionaries cannot represent the motherland, let alone the relationship between the people of all ethnic groups in China. Tibet has always been a part of China's territory. The Tibetan ethnic group and the Han ethnic group and other ethnic groups in China have a long history and a close and united friendship between ethnic groups. Any imperialist conspiracy to obstruct the liberation of the Tibetan people and Tibetan ethnic minorities, including the Tibetan ethnic minorities, is absolutely not allowed by the people of all ethnic groups in China. The people of all ethnic groups in China oppose any imperialist forces invading Tibet. The Chinese People's Liberation Army, which represents the interests of the people of all ethnic groups, has the responsibility to protect and liberate the Tibetan people and Tibetan ethnic minorities, so that they can be free from the enslavement of domestic and foreign reactionaries. Any imperialist ambitionist who dares to obstruct this expression of ethnic friendship will be battered and bruised. The shameful failure of Japanese and US imperialism in invading China, all aggressors should learn a lesson from this!
　　Tibet has been a part of Chinese territory for centuries, and will be a part of the People's Republic of China in the future. This is unswerving. The difference is that the People's Republic of China, which is about to be realized, is led by the Communist Party of China, which represents the highest interests of the people of all ethnic groups in China. Contrary to the reactionary Kuomintang and all the enslavement rule of Tibet in Chinese history, the policy of the Communist Party of China is to advocate that the people of all ethnic groups in China are equal, unite and help each other, adopt a protective policy for the interests of ethnic minorities, respect the customs and habits and freedom of religious belief of ethnic minorities, oppose oppression and hostility between ethnic groups, and promote brotherly friendship. Recently, the People's Liberation Army's advances in the Northwest and Southwest have been warmly welcomed by ethnic minorities such as the Hui and Miao, and there have been cheers along the way, which fully demonstrates the correctness of the Communist Party of China's policies towards ethnic minorities and the excellent discipline of the Liberation Army in implementing its policies. Therefore, when the Tibetan local authorities expelled the bogus Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission delegation this time, they used the excuse of "preventing communist activities," which is not only unfounded, but also an extremely wrong and reactionary excuse. Obviously, they were instructed and instigated by British and US imperialism, which is contrary to the interests of the Tibetan people and Tibetan ethnic minorities. The Tibetan people and Tibetan ethnic minorities, who have long been enslaved by imperialism and the reactionary Kuomintang, should unite, expose the conspiracy of US and British imperialism, get rid of the shackles imposed on Tibet by imperialism, and prepare to welcome the People's Liberation Army's march into Tibet, liberate Tibet, and liberate all of China.

　　中国人民一定要解放西藏
    杜波
    中国人民解放战争胜利的发展，即将彻底解放全中国，国民党反动派的残余势力即将完全被消灭，帝国主义侵略势力在遭到了可耻的失败之后，正在阴谋分割与窃取中国的一部分领土主权。美帝国主义策动吞并台湾是一例，美、英、印的侵略者同时向我边陲西藏施展其侵略阴谋又是一例。最近西藏的“反共”事变，充分暴露了帝国主义企图分割西藏，奴役西藏人民，进而卷土重来，继续奴役中国人民的尴尬行为。
    西藏地方当权者之驱逐国民党反动政府派驻西藏的伪蒙藏委员会代表团是可以理解的，是应该被赞成的。因为国民党反动政府及其一切代表机关是反人民的，是中国各民族人民的共同敌人，中国人民完全不需要这样一个反人民的政府，西藏人民和西藏少数民族唾弃它，这是必然的。中国人民解放军也正为推翻这个反动统治而胜利作战，并即将取得完全胜利。但是，问题的症结不在这里，而是透过这一事件，充分暴露了帝国主义野心家企图利用西藏人民和西藏少数民族不满国民党反动政府错误的民族歧视政策，挑拨西藏与中国的关系，乘国民党反动政府陷于四分五裂，中国人民解放军尚未到达西藏的间隙趁火打劫，窃取西藏，掠夺中国领土主权，并实行“反共”，妄图阻滞或延缓西藏人民和西藏少数民族的获得解放，继续奴役我西藏人民和西藏少数民族。这是中国人民所坚决反对的。
    美英帝国主义侵略西藏的野心是非常清楚的，几乎与这次西藏事件同时，英帝国主义通过印度尼赫鲁反动政府，控制了印度与西藏间的土邦锡金与不丹，这一行动乃在威胁西藏地方当局进一步就范。同时，印度驻西藏的使节团团长英人查里逊，原定本年退休，现在突然宣布延长任期一年。查里逊是一个凶狠毒辣的侵略主义的野心家，自英帝国主义侵略西藏以来，便是由他一手经略。新近宣布其延长任期，目的是很明白的。而不久以前印度事务官戴雅尔匆匆赴西藏“调查事变经过”，更明白的暴露了英帝国主义亟图进一步控制西藏的野心。美帝国主义对西藏最近局势的发展，则表示极端“关切”。八月十日，华盛顿外交人士特别声称，去年六月“访问”美国的西藏商务代表团曾向美国表示“愿与美国通商”。臭名昭著的美帝间谍无线电评论员汤姆斯，则于七月底经曼谷潜往拉萨活动，其护照则系由印度尼赫鲁政府所发给。不言而喻，不论英帝国主义也好，美帝国主义也好，都是在利用印度尼赫鲁政府作为工具，加紧其侵略西藏的步骤。印度“闪电”报即清楚的指出：“英美煽动的西藏暴动，实际上是阴谋使西藏隶属于英美。”
    美英帝国主义觊觎西藏由来已久，而英帝国主义的侵入则更早。西藏在地理上接近印度，一七六二年英帝夺取印度以后，与印度接壤的西藏也就被视为它侵略的对象。由于满清政府的腐败，英帝侵略势力得以乘虚侵入西藏。民国初年的军阀混战，及以后国民党反动政府的腐败无能，无不便利了英帝国主义的侵略野心的发展。美帝国主义则于抗日战争期间侵入西藏，那时美帝空军来中国作战，开辟了由印度到昆明、重庆的“驼峰航线”，因时乘便，那时就曾以探测路线为借口，派遣其军事间谍人员深入西藏各地，与西藏地方当局建立了情报关系，美机也就常常越出航路，飞临西藏上空，作“某种电讯的连络”。其后驻华美军总部又曾派遣间谍伊利亚·托尔斯太作“穿过西藏的旅行”，潜赴拉萨活动。美帝国主义势力从此渗入西藏。去年六月间，西藏地方当局曾派遣其所谓商务代表团“访问”了华盛顿和伦敦，在“商务”式的集会中，大谈其西藏“独立”问题，更奇怪的是在这个“商务代表团”中，还有一位非“商务”的军人绥康。代表团在伦敦时，英首相艾德礼曾亲予接见，这当然不是偶然性的或商务性的“访问”了，而是英美帝国主义在加紧策动对西藏的侵略。
    从西藏统治者内部矛盾来说，是以达赖和班禅的对立为其集中的表现。班禅和达赖各有领域，班禅主后藏，达赖主前藏。在政治上则班禅是国民党反动派所扶持的，而达赖则依附于英美帝国主义。撇开宗教，作为国民党反动派与英美帝国主义争夺西藏统治权奴役西藏人民和少数民族的政治偶像这一点来说，达赖与班禅常因权势而互相交恶。由于英帝国主义在西藏的势力增长，班禅在一九二四年被迫逃出西藏，流亡在青海一带，十二年前被其敌手所暗杀。新班禅现年十二岁，名叫宇保慈丹。达赖现年亦仅十三岁，留在拉萨。所以国民党反动政府虽然派有伪蒙藏委员会代表团驻在拉萨，那也只是一个空头机关而已。
    但是，不管英美帝国主义如何对西藏野心勃勃，而西藏人民和西藏少数民族是始终怀念与仰望着祖国的。虽则满清以及国民党反动政府的错误民族政策，曾招致西藏少数民族的反对与不满，但所有这些反动派都不能代表祖国，更不能代表中国境内各民族人民的关系。西藏历来就是中国版图的一部分，藏民族与汉民族及中国境内其他各民族，有着悠久的历史渊源和民族间亲密团结的友谊，任何帝国主义阴谋阻滞西藏人民和西藏少数民族的解放，包括西藏少数民族在内的中国各民族人民都是绝对不允许的，中国各民族人民反对任何帝国主义势力侵入西藏。代表各民族人民利益的中国人民解放军，有责任保护和解放西藏人民及西藏少数民族，使他们免受国内外反动派的奴役。任何帝国主义野心家如果敢于阻挠这种民族友情的表现，它就会碰得焦头烂额。日本与美帝国主义侵略中国的可耻失败，一切侵略者都应该从这里学得教训！
    西藏几世纪以来就是中国领土的一部分，将来也是中华人民共和国的一部分，这是确定不移的。所不同的，即将实现的中华人民共和国，是由代表全中国各民族人民最高利益的中国共产党所领导。与国民党反动派及中国历史上一切对西藏的奴役统治相反，中国共产党的政策，是主张中国境内各民族人民一律平等，团结互助，对少数民族的利益采取保护政策，尊重少数民族自己的风俗习惯和宗教信仰自由，反对各民族间的压迫与敌视，而发扬兄弟般的友谊。最近人民解放军在西北、西南的进军，受到回族、苗族等少数民族的热烈欢迎，军行所至，欢声夹道，更充分的表现了中国共产党对少数民族政策的正确和解放军执行政策的纪律优良。因此，这次西藏地方当局驱逐伪蒙藏委员会代表团时，借口“防止共产党活动”，这不仅毫无事实根据，而且是极端错误与反动的借口，显然是在受了英美帝国主义的指使与挑拨，这是违背西藏人民与西藏少数民族利益的。久受帝国主义与国民党反动派奴役的西藏人民和西藏少数民族应该团结起来，揭穿美英帝国主义的阴谋，摆脱帝国主义所加于西藏的束缚，准备迎接人民解放军进军西藏，解放西藏，解放全中国。
