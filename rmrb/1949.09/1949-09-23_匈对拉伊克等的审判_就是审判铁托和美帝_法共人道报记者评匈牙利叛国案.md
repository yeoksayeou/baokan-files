Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 22nd: A reporter from L'Humanité stationed in Budapest reported on the trial of the traitors Rajk, Palffy, and Brankov by the Hungarian People's Court, stating: The trial of Rajk and his accomplices is, in effect, a trial of Tito and the Trotskyites, and a trial of the American imperialism that controls these people. The reporter cited the defendants' evidence, stating: The defendants' confessions confirmed their crimes, but also confirmed the crimes of Tito and the likes of Ranković, Đilas, and Kardelj. Every piece of evidence also confirms the important role played by the United States in the large-scale conspiracy against not only Hungary but also all people's democracies and the Soviet Union.

　　匈对拉伊克等的审判
  　就是审判铁托和美帝
    法共人道报记者评匈牙利叛国案
    【新华社北平二十二日电】据塔斯社巴黎讯：人道报驻布达佩斯记者报道，匈牙利人民法庭审讯叛国犯拉伊克、巴尔费、布兰科夫的情形称：对拉伊克与他的同谋的审判，实际就是对铁托与托洛斯基分子的审判，是对把这些人掌握在手中的美帝国主义的审判。记者引证被告的证据称：被告的口供确证了他们的罪状，但同时亦确证了铁托与兰科维奇、德热拉斯、卡德尔之流的罪状。每件证据亦确证了美国不仅在反对匈牙利而且在反对所有人民民主国家以及反对苏联的大规模阴谋中所起的重要作用。
