　　A Visit with Representatives of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference
  　Building the People's Air Force
    Liu @ Ping
    I served in the Kuomintang reactionary air force for a long time. Because I opposed participating in the civil war to massacre the people, I resolutely revolted at the end of June 1946, before the U.S. imperialist-aided Kuomintang reactionaries launched a full-scale anti-people civil war, and stood on the side of the people. This time, I am able to participate in the unprecedented People's Political Consultative Conference in Chinese history as a representative of the People's Air Force, which makes me feel infinitely honored.
    The convening of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference is a sign of the victory of the Chinese people and also a sign of the victory of the people all over the world. This is the result of more than 20 years of arduous struggle by the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people. The heroic People's Liberation Army has achieved a great national victory and prepared sufficient conditions for the convening of the CPPCC. This conference is composed of representatives of the Chinese Communist Party, various democratic parties, various people's organizations, various regions, democratic figures from all walks of life, domestic ethnic minorities, and overseas Chinese. There are workers, peasants, students, administrative personnel from liberated areas, and representatives of the People's Liberation Army's army, navy, and air force, as well as representatives of democratic figures from political, economic, literary, educational, news, social science, natural science, industrial and commercial circles, and religious groups. This is the unprecedented great unity of the Chinese people. All the representatives are earnestly, seriously, and harmoniously discussing the major policies and various proposals for nation-building. Every representative is holding the enthusiasm to build a good people's China. Various opinions are concentrated and discussed, and discussed and concentrated again, giving play to extensive democracy and implementing the scientific spirit of democratic centralism. In this democratic and united atmosphere, this unprecedented People's Political Consultative Conference in Chinese history will surely achieve complete and victorious success and lay a solid foundation for the People's Republic of China.
    Under the unprecedented great unity of the Chinese people and with the assistance of the world people's democratic camp headed by the Soviet Union, an independent, free, and prosperous new China will be built vigorously and rapidly. Looking forward to the future of the new China, people are filled with infinite hope and the joy of new life.
    As for the construction of our People's Air Force, Chairman Mao has already affirmed in his opening speech that "We will not only have a strong army, but also a strong air force and a strong navy." We believe that under the wise leadership of the Communist Party and the people's leaders Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, the Chinese people's air force will surely grow rapidly, just like the entire people's armed forces, and become a powerful force to defend the motherland and defend world peace.
    I would like to tell my old colleagues who are still in the Kuomintang reactionary air force that you know more clearly than I do about the increasingly blatant and thorough darkness, corruption, dictatorship, and treason of the Chiang government. Recently, I heard that pilots of Japanese militarist elements have arrived in Taiwan, preparing to massacre the Chinese people again. I don't know what you think? Think about what the eight-year war of resistance was for in the first place? The central government of the People's Republic will be established soon, and Guangzhou, Sichuan, Taiwan, and Hainan Island will soon be liberated. You may already know a lot about the PLA's policies. Instead of fleeing with the remaining reactionary elements, you might as well wait for liberation in place; instead of waiting for liberation in place, you might as well revolt by flying your planes immediately. Don't easily believe those rumors of a "Third World War." The forces of world democracy have become unprecedentedly strong, greatly exceeding the reactionary forces headed by U.S. imperialism. If they dare to provoke a war, it will only accelerate the demise of U.S. imperialism. Don't you know that the Chiang family's bureaucratic capitalists have already bought houses and property in France, Spain, South America, and other places, preparing to flee? You should also plan for yourselves and choose your own path. Now is the last good opportunity! Don't hesitate any longer.
    At the birth of this glorious new China People's Government, I can't help but tell those who are still in the dark, unliberated Kuomintang reactionary air force remnants, let's bravely join hands, come to the people's side together, and work happily together to build a strong people's air force.

　　中国人民政协代表访问记
  　建设人民空军
    刘＠平
    我曾经长时间在国民党反动派的空军中服务过，因为我反对参加屠杀人民的内战才毅然决然的于一九四六年六月底，当美帝援助的国民党反动派发动反人民的全面内战之前起义，站在人民方面来。这次我能够以人民空军代表的资格，来参加中国历史上空前的人民政治协商会议，使我感到了无限的荣幸。
    中国人民政治协商会议的召开是中国人民胜利的标志，也是全世界人民胜利的标志。这是中国共产党和中国人民二十余年艰苦奋斗的结果。英勇的解放军取得了全国性的伟大胜利，准备好了政协召开的充分条件。这个会议是由中国共产党，各民主党派，各人民团体，各地区，各界民主人士，国内少数民族，海外侨胞的代表组成的。这里有工人、农民、学生、解放区区行政人员，和解放军陆海空军的代表，也有政治、经济、文艺、教育、新闻、社会科学、自然科学、工商业界、宗教团体等民主人士的代表。这是中国人民空前的大团结。各代表都是认真地、严肃地，同时也是和谐地讨论着建国的大政方针和各项提案。每个代表都是抱着把人民中国建设好的热忱。各种意见是集中了又讨论，讨论了又集中，发挥着广泛的民主，贯彻着科学的民主集中精神。在这民主的、团结的空气里，这中国历史上空前的人民政协会议必然会得到圆满、胜利的成功，奠定中华人民共和国稳固的基础。
    在中国人民空前的大团结之下，在以苏联为首的世界人民民主阵营的援助之下，一个独立、自由、富强的新中国会很快地蓬蓬勃勃地建设起来。展望新中国的远景，令人充满了无限的希望和新生的愉快。
    至于说到我们人民空军的建设工作，毛主席在开幕词里已经肯定的回答“我们将不但有一个强大的陆军，而且有一个强大的空军和一个强大的海军”。我们相信在共产党和人民领袖毛主席朱总司令的英明领导下，中国人民的空军必然也和整个人民武装一样，很快的壮大起来，成为保卫祖国、保卫世界和平的强大力量。
    我在这里告诉现在尚留在国民党反动派空军中的老同事们，现在蒋政府更露骨更彻底的黑暗、贪污、独裁、卖国等罪恶，你们知道的比我更清楚。最近听说日本军国主义分子的飞行员，已经到了台湾，准备又来屠杀中国人，我不晓得你们作何感想？想想当初八年抗战是为了什么？人民共和国的中央政府马上就要成立了，广州、四川、台湾、海南岛很快就要解放，你们对解放军的政策可能已经知道不少，你与其随反动派残余分子流亡，就不如在原地等着解放；与其在原地等着解放就不如立即驾机起义。你们不要轻信那些“三次世界大战”的谣言，现在世界民主的势力已经空前壮大，大大超过了美帝为首的反动力量。如果他胆敢挑起战争的话，那就要提前促进美帝国主义的灭亡。你们不知道蒋家官僚财阀们已经在法国、西班牙、南美洲等地方购买房子财产，在准备逃亡吗？你们也应该为自己打算一下吧，也应当选择一下自己的道路吧。现在已经是最后好的机会了！不能再徘徊观望。
    在这个灿烂的新中国人民政府的诞生时，我不禁要告诉那些还留在黑暗的尚未解放的国民党反动派的残余空军中的人们，大家勇敢的携起手来，一同投奔人民方面来共同为建设强大的人民空军而愉快的工作吧。
