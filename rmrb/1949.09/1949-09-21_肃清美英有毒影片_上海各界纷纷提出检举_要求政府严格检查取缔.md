　　Eliminating Poisonous American and British Films
  　All Circles in Shanghai Submit Reports and Demand Strict Government Inspection and Prohibition
    [Special dispatch from our Shanghai reporter, 19th] All circles in Shanghai have launched a movement to expose poisonous films from American and British imperialism. In recent days, Shanghai's Liberation Daily, Xinwen Daily, Dagong Daily, Wenhui Daily, and others have published extensive opinions and demands from all sectors, and issued short commentaries. People from all walks of life have held various forms of seminars to launch serious criticisms of the American and British films shown in Shanghai's cinemas. They pointed out that currently, low-grade, inferior, and absurd films from the United States, Britain, and other countries are flooding the market, seriously poisoning the Chinese people. Imperialists use these reactionary films to promote their imperialist power, advocate racial discrimination, distort class concepts, peddle abnormal lifestyles, induce erotic fantasies, and numb fighting will, spreading their extremely bad toxins as tools for their continued cultural and economic aggression. According to statistics from newspapers here, among the hundreds of films screened in July, these obscene and slanderous films accounted for as much as 67 percent. Therefore, all sectors unanimously demand that the government strictly inspect and ban such bad films. In recent days, those who have published their opinions in various newspapers include Shanghai film workers, actors, Peking opera workers, the Higher Education Federation, the Musicians Association, Yue opera actors, the Shanghai Student Federation, and the Family Women's Federation. Dagong Daily also said in its editorial: "In the new Shanghai of the people, we need to see healthy films with real content. Today, as we build a new Shanghai and fully advance the six major tasks, poisonous American films cannot be allowed to continue to run rampant." The Shanghai Cultural Management Committee has accepted the reasonable demands of all sectors and decided to deal with them appropriately.
