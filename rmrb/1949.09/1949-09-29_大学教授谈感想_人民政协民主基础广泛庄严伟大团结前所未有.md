[Report from our newspaper] According to news from the Beijing University Correspondents Group: Professor Fan Hong of Peking University, who attended the People's Political Consultative Conference as a representative, spoke highly of the democratic spirit discussed at the conference during a discussion with teachers of the Economics Department on the 23rd. He said happily, "The Communist Party has done an excellent job!" He added, "An elderly overseas Chinese representative (referring to Situ Meitang) was helped onto the stage by two people to speak. When I saw this scene, I was deeply moved." He praised the democracy of the conference, saying, "This kind of democracy is completely different from the democracy of capitalist countries in Europe and America in that it involves repeated discussions to reach an agreement as much as possible. The draft proposals put forward in the People's Political Consultative Conference have all been repeatedly discussed in small groups in the preparatory meeting. If a representative disagrees, they can propose further discussion. For example, on the issue of opposing Han chauvinism, it should be the issue of opposing great-nationalism, so it was debated many times, and in the end, the CCP's proposal was passed. Because the work of the preparatory meeting's various groups was done very well, there was almost no debate in the general assembly during this People's Political Consultative Conference, unlike the British and American parliaments, which are a complete mess of吵. This is my first lesson in learning about politics."

Zhou Peiyuan, Provost of Tsinghua University, said after attending the opening ceremony of the People's Political Consultative Conference on the 21st as an observer: "Such a solemn and great scene and a harmonious and united atmosphere cannot be seen in any previous gatherings. I believe that every representative and observer who attended the conference felt that under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the People's Republic of China has unlimited bright prospects!" Duan Xuefu, Director of the Mathematics Department, said: This time, with the opening of the CPPCC meeting, we have understood the truth of the revolution, and everyone is happier and more hopeful for true unity. These representatives can indeed represent the opinions and demands of various parties, groups, and nationalities, which is completely different from the fact that members of the U.S. Congress always serve the bourgeoisie. Wu Jingchao, professor of the Sociology Department, said: I felt very excited when I heard the news of the CPPCC meeting. From now on, the government is our people's government, it is our own government. We should support our own government, give it support, accept its leadership, and implement its policies and decrees. I believe that the new government under the leadership of the Communist Party will definitely complete the new tasks of unification and construction, and will surely enable the Chinese people to live a life of equality, freedom, and happiness based on the abundance of agricultural and industrial products and the continuous rise of cultural standards.

Professor Huang Guozhang of Normal University said: The establishment of the New CPPCC is the birth of a new China and also the crystallization of a century of revolution, but this is only the first step in the Long March, and long-term construction still requires our efforts. Professor Fu Zhongsun said: Building a new China is a major task for each of us at present. Our China needs a large number of talents, and we must work hard in a down-to-earth manner. At the same time, everyone needs to understand that building a new China is their own business, without slacking off, without being passive, and handling things carefully.

　　大学教授谈感想 　 人民政协民主基础广泛庄严伟大团结前所未有
    【本报讯】据北京各大学通讯组消息：出席人民政协代表北大教授樊弘于二十三日在该校经济系教员谈话会上，对政协会议讨论的民主精神，倍加赞扬。他高兴地说：“中共的事情，做得真好极了！”他又说：“有一位年老华侨代表（指司徒美堂）被两个人扶上台讲话，我看到这种景象，心底真极为感动。”他盛赞大会的民主说：“这种民主与欧美资本主义国家的民主，绝不相同处就是反复讨论，尽量取得协议。在人民政协中提出的种种草案，都是在筹备会中分小组反复讨论过的，代表如有不同意的地方，可以提出再讨论。如反对大汉族主义，应该是反对大民族主义问题，所以反复争论了许多次，结果还是中共的提议通过了。因为筹备会各小组的工作做得非常好，所以这次人民政协开会，在大会中几乎没有争论，不象英美的国会吵得一塌糊涂。这可就是我学习政治的第一课。”
    清华大学教务长周培源二十一日出席人民政协开幕大会旁听归来后说：“这样庄严伟大的场面与和蔼团结的气氛，是已往任何集会所不能看到的。我相信每一个出席大会的代表和旁听的人，都感到在共产党和毛主席领导下，中华人民共和国是有无限光明的远景的！”数学系主任段学复说：这一次政协会议开幕，我们了解了革命的真理，大家更高兴，更寄希望于真正的统一团结了。这些代表们确能代表各党派，各团体，各民族人民的意见与主张，和美国国会议员之始终为资产阶级服务是完全不同的。社会系教授吴景超说：我听到政协开会的消息，感到非常的兴奋。从今以后，政府是我们人民的政府了，是我们自己的政府了。我们应当拥护自己的政府，加以支持，接受其领导，推行其政策法令。我相信，在中共领导下的新政府，一定能完成统一及建设的新任务，一定能使中国人民，在农产品和工业品盈丰的基础上，在文化水准不断上升的基础上，过一种平等自由与幸福的生活。
    师范大学黄国璋教授说：新政协的成立是新中国的诞生也是百年来革命的结晶，但这不过是万里长征的第一步，长期的建设还须要我们努力。傅种孙教授说：建设新中国，是我们每一个人当前重大的任务，我们中国需要大批的人才，要脚踏实地的努力，同时须要每个人都了解建设新中国的事，就是自己的事，不怠工，不消极，小心处理。
