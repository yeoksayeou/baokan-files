Guard Platoon Leader Wu Wenxiang
　　Zhao Youqiao

Our guard platoon is a unit that everyone recognizes as doing a good job, which is inseparable from the correct leadership of Platoon Leader Wu Wenxiang.

Comrade Wu Wenxiang is a veteran soldier who joined the army relatively early (1938) and has been in the army for more than ten years. Since being transferred to the guard platoon, he has become more aware of the importance and glory of the task. After arriving at the garrison, he always first surveyed the surrounding terrain: whether the walls were collapsed or had gaps, how many doors there were, and how many guards should be stationed; he made sure the positions of the sentry posts, where they should be during the day and where they should be at night, were very detailed and strict. He always checked the sentry several times at night and went to bed two or three hours later than everyone else every day. Once, he saw a guard standing under the light at night, and he quickly instructed him to go to a hidden place. It happened that a special agent fired a gun from the mountain towards the light that night, which avoided the danger. He also often organized soldiers to help each other study culture and educate everyone: "Protecting the leaders is an important and glorious task, don't be paralyzed or careless..."

Once, a strong wind and rain collapsed a section of the surrounding wall. He made suggestions to the leadership several times and personally repaired it. In the days before it was repaired, he always got up several times at night to patrol and check. Some people said, "Hum! What are you afraid of? Chiang Kai-shek has been defeated! How dare a few small chickens (meaning a few special agents) come here?" But he replied seriously, "It's better to be careful than sorry, it's better to be careful." His vigilance is very high.

It is something that has not been noticed for a long time. Everyone threw their worn-out socks and shoes outside the wall or in the garbage dump, but he picked them back up in pairs. He accumulated a large pile in two months and personally pushed them to the supply office in a trolley. This is the thing we promoted during the Anti-Japanese War, turning waste into treasure and turning broken shoes into new shoes. Because of his concern and love for the people's property, he still maintains this fine tradition.

Comrade Wu Wenxiang's high degree of vigilance and sense of responsibility, and his exemplary deeds of caring for and cherishing the people's property, have been enthusiastically supported and praised by the masses. In this merit evaluation campaign, he was selected as a glorious model worker and was awarded a first-class merit.

　　警卫排长武文祥
    赵友樵
    我们这里的警卫排是大家公认工作好的一个单位，这与排长武文祥的正确领导是分不开的。
    武文祥同志是参军较早（一九三八年）的一位战士，在军队里已有十多年的历史了。低低的个儿，黑胖子，短小精悍。自调警卫排工作后，他更认识到任务的重大和光荣。到驻地后，他总是先察看周围地形：墙壁有无倒塌，有无缺口，有几个门，应配置几个卫兵；岗哨位置，白天应在哪里，夜间应在哪里，都搞得非常详细和严密。他总是夜间查几次哨，每天都要比大家晚睡两三个钟头。有一次看见卫兵夜间站在灯光下，他便赶快指示他到隐蔽处去，恰好那夜特务从山头朝灯光处打枪，得以避免了危险。他并经常组织战士互助学习文化教育大家：“保卫首长，任务是重大和光荣的，不要麻痹、大意……”。
    有一次大风雨把围墙淋塌了一段，他几次向领导提出意见，并亲自动手修理；在没修好的几天内，他夜间总起来几次去巡视查看。有的人说：“哼！怕个啥，蒋介石都揍垮啦！几个小鸡毛（少数特务的意思）还能敢跑到这里来？”但他严肃的回答说：“不怕一万，就怕万一，小心谨慎些好。”他的警惕性是提得很高的。
    是久已不使人注意的事了。大家把穿烂的袜子鞋都扔到了墙外或垃圾堆里，他却一对对的捡了回来，两个月积了一大堆，亲自用小车推到供给处。这是抗战期间，我们提倡废物利用，破鞋翻做新鞋的事情。由于他对人民财产的关心和爱惜，现在却依然保持这种优良传统。
    武文祥同志这种高度的警惕性和责任感，对于人民财产关心爱护的模范事迹，为群众一致热烈拥护和赞扬，这次评功运动中，他被选为光荣的模范工作者，立了一功。
