　　Severe Flooding in Eastern Hebei
　　Government Directs Strengthening of Flood Prevention and Disaster Investigation

　　[This newspaper dispatch] Since late July, the eastern Hebei region has experienced over twenty consecutive days of incessant rain. The rainfall has been unprecedented, causing alarming and sudden increases in the water levels of various rivers. For example, the water level of the Luan River reached 29.79 meters, with a flow rate of 19,800 cubic meters per second, nearly doubling the maximum flow rate of the great flood of 1930. The Chaobai River's flow rate reached 9,342 cubic meters per second, also surpassing any previous year's record. Moreover, eastern Hebei's incorporation into the North China region occurred relatively recently, resulting in a lack of spring repairs to river embankments and weak flood defenses. Consequently, the floods breached many dikes, causing a more severe disaster. According to existing survey data, there are a total of 76 breaches of various sizes along the rivers, inundating approximately 3,376,931.7 mu of land and destroying over 2,300 houses. In the affected areas, apart from some sorghum and corn that can still be harvested, most other crops have been destroyed. In low-lying areas, it is feared that autumn wheat planting will also be difficult this year. Currently, the eastern Hebei government is instructing flood prevention organizations at all levels to vigorously strengthen flood prevention efforts while also initiating investigations into the disaster situation.

　　During the flood, many cadres and masses risked their lives to bravely protect the dikes, turning many dangerous situations into safe ones. For example, when a three-foot-wide breach occurred in Wangfuying Village, Gou River, Sanhe County, Shi Zhenbiao from Xinzhuang immediately jumped into the breach to block it with his body. He was swept away by the rapid current. Subsequently, Zhang Mingchi and Guan Yongrong jumped in one after the other, lying shoulder to shoulder in front of the breach. The masses then used twelve cauldrons to cover it, and used piles, mats, and sacks to block the breach within an hour. Another example is when the embankment at Xidatun, Sanhe, collapsed continuously. The soil bags and willow branches thrown in were swept away by the current. Li Fuchun from Qiaotouzi voluntarily jumped into the water to deal with the emergency. In the muddy riverbed, two zhang deep, during a night of continuous heavy rain, he piled up the soil bags thrown from above one by one. Finally, he tied them to a large tree with leather rope, thus consolidating the project. During the emergency rescue, he and more than a thousand laborers did not even eat a meal for a day and a night.

　　However, in some areas, due to a lack of responsibility, negligence, or unauthorized changes to higher-level engineering plans on the part of the leadership, water disasters occurred in circumstances where they could have been prevented. For example, the flood prevention headquarters instructed the county and villages to block the north gully entrance of Xicaigezhuang, Changli, twice, but this was never carried out, causing the floodwaters to pour in through the gully entrance when the flood came. In Leting County, the planned new flood control dike was changed to a temporary small embankment without authorization, and it was not even completed when the flood arrived, resulting in its being washed away. These are two different lessons that are worth remembering in various places.

### 冀东水灾严重　政府指示加强防汛调查灾情

　　冀东水灾严重
  　政府指示加强防汛调查灾情
    【本报讯】冀东地区自七月下旬以来，霪雨连绵二十余日，雨量空前增大，各河洪水惊人暴涨，如滦河水位，竟达二九·七九公尺，流量达一九八○○秒立方公尺，超过民国十九年最大流量几达一倍。潮白河流量达九三四二秒立方公尺，亦超过以往任何一年记录；加以冀东划入华北区较晚，河堤春工未做，河防薄弱，以致此次被洪水冲破的决口颇多。灾情较为严重。据现有调查材料，各河大小决口共计七十六道，淹地约三、三七六、九三一·七亩，毁房二千三百余间。被灾地区除高粱玉茭尚有部分收获外其他庄稼大部被冲毁。地势低洼处，今年秋麦亦恐难下种。现冀东政府正指示各级防汛组织，一面大力加强防汛，一方面着手调查灾情。
    洪水暴发时，不少干部和群众曾冒生命危险，奋力抢护，使多处险工化险为夷。如三河县沟河王甫营村发生三尺宽之漏洞时，新集史振标便立即跳入漏洞以身堵塞，竟被急流冲出堤外，之后，张明池、冠永荣二人又紧接跳下，并肩躺在漏洞前，群众跟着拔锅十二口扣住，用桩席麻袋在一小时内即将漏洞堵住。又如三河西达屯堤埝坍塌不已，投入土袋及挂柳均随流逐去。桥头子李富春便自动投入水中抢险。在夜晚大雨连绵，水深二丈的混泥河底，他将由上面投下的土袋一一垒起，最后用皮绳拴在大树上，才使工程得以巩固。在抢险中，他和一千多民工一天一夜连饭也没有吃。
    但也有些地区，由于领导上责任心不够，麻痹大意，或擅自变动上级工程计划，因而，在某些可以抢护的情况下，反而遭受了水灾。如昌黎西蔡各庄北沟口，曾由防汛指挥部两次指示县村堵塞，但终未进行，致洪水来时，水即由沟口灌了进去。乐亭县私自将计划新修之防洪堤改为临时小埝，且洪水来时尚未修完，致遭洪水冲没。这是两种不同的教训，值得各地记取。
