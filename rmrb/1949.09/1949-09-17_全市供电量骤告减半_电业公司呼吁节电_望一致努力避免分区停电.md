　　Citywide Electricity Supply Suddenly Halved
　　Electric Company Calls for Conservation
　　Hope for United Efforts to Avoid Zonal Power Outages
    [This Newspaper's Report] At 5:30 PM on the 14th of this month, the No. 6 generator at the Shijingshan Power Plant failed, with most of the internal parts of the steam turbine damaged. The cause is still under investigation. This generator has a capacity of 25,000 kilowatts, accounting for half of the entire power plant's generating capacity. Repairs will take two to three months.

    After the breakdown, the power supply to Beiping was reduced by half. Although the company has requested the tram company, the cement company, and the steel plant to generate some power on its behalf, and some power has been transmitted from Tianjin and Tangshan, the main solution still depends on conservation, especially during lighting hours (i.e., from 6 PM to 11 PM, because this is when the load is highest; if electricity is not conserved, zonal power outages will be unavoidable). The branch company appeals: those with two lights should use only one, and electricity users should comply with the contractual provisions and not use electricity during lighting hours. Yesterday (the 16th) at 2 PM, the branch company invited representatives from the North China Bureau, the North China People's Government, the Municipal Government, the Municipal Party Committee, and municipal organizations to a symposium to discuss specific measures for conserving electricity. At the meeting, the branch company reported on this serious situation. Participants put forward specific suggestions, believing that significant achievements had been made in electricity conservation in the past, and that electricity conservation should continue now. However, the main thing is to awaken the attention of all two million people in Beiping and turn it into a mass electricity conservation movement. Representatives from various organizations prepared to relay this information immediately upon returning. It was also decided that in the future, the company would invite the Municipal Party Committee and the Municipal Government to jointly discuss how to further promote this electricity conservation movement.

　　全市供电量骤告减半
  　电业公司呼吁节电
　  望一致努力避免分区停电
    【本报讯】本月十四日下午五时三十分，石景山发电所六号发电机发生故障，汽轮机内部坏了大半，原因还没查明。这个发电机发电量为两万五千千瓦，占整个发电所发电量的一半。修起来需要两三个月的时间。
    故障发生后，北平供电量少了一半，公司虽已请电车公司、水泥公司、钢铁厂代发一部，由天津唐山输来一部，但主要还须靠节约，尤其要在照明时间。（即晚上六点到十一点，因为这时负荷最高，如果不节电，便只有分区停电。）分公司呼吁：有两个灯的只用一个，电力用户遵照合同规定，在照明时间不用电。分公司在昨日（十六日）下午二时邀请华北局、华北人民政府、市府、市委及市团体开座谈会，商讨节电的具体办法。会上由分公司报告了这一严重情况，参加会的人提出了具体意见，认为过去节电有很大的成绩，今仍应该继续节电，但主要还在唤起全北平市二百万人民的注意，成为群众性的节电运动。各机关代表准备回去马上传达。并决定今后由公司请市委、市府共商如何进一步推进这一节电运动。
