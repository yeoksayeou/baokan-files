Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 23rd -- The countries of Britain, France and Italy, which have surrendered to American monopoly capital by sacrificing the interests of the working class and implementing currency devaluation, are facing strong resistance from the domestic working class. The wage increase movement, which was brewing among workers in all industries and regions of Britain before the pound was devalued, has been intensified because the devaluation of the pound has actually reduced workers' wages. More than 400,000 railway workers across Britain, due to the arbitration court's blatant rejection of their demand for a 10-shilling weekly wage increase, which they had put forward months ago, are preparing to launch a go-slow strike across Britain that would paralyze all railway transportation. This strike has already begun in Wellington. The Scottish coal mine strike is expanding. Miners in Lancashire intend to resume the strike. Two and a half million machine workers and shipbuilders have already made a strong demand for a £1 weekly wage increase last week. Currently, more than four million workers across Britain are demanding wage increases. The strong resistance of British workers to the consequences of the pound's devaluation has put the right-wing leaders of the Trades Union Congress's supreme committee (who deceived the recently convened American Trades Union Congress into supporting the Labor government's wage freeze policy) in danger of "being driven away by the masses of members" (Associated Press). Therefore, the supreme committee had to announce on the 20th that it could not agree to the devaluation of the pound, and hypocritically demanded that Cripps guarantee that prices would not rise again, in an attempt to continue to deceive its broad membership. In France, French Communist Party parliamentary group chairman Duclos wrote to National Assembly Speaker Herriot after the franc's devaluation, demanding that an emergency meeting of the Assembly's standing committee be convened immediately to discuss the franc devaluation issue. The executive committee of the French General Confederation of Labor has met to discuss preparing to put forward demands for unfreezing and increasing wages. Even the Socialist Party's "Workers' Force" union has demanded that wages be unfrozen, prices be controlled, and announced that it will not hesitate to join forces with the French General Confederation of Labor. Italian Communist Party members of parliament Togliatti, Vittorio and Bessenti have demanded that the National Assembly conduct a general debate on the government's financial and economic policies.

　　英四百万工人要求增加工资
  　补偿货币贬值损失
    【新华社北平二十三日电】以牺牲工人阶级利益向美国独占资本投降而实行货币贬值的英、法、意等国，已面临国内工人阶级的强大反抗。在英镑宣布贬值前即在全英各地各业工人中酝酿着的增加工资运动，已因英镑贬值实际上削减了工人工资而更形激化。全英四十多万铁路工人由于仲裁法庭悍然拒绝了他们已提出数月之久的每周增加工资十先令的要求，正准备在全英发动足以麻痹全部铁路运输的放慢罢工。这一罢工并已在威灵顿开始。苏格兰煤矿罢工正在扩大。兰开厦的矿工打算恢复罢工。二百五十万名机器工人及造船工人，上周即已提出每周增加工资一镑的强硬要求。目前，全英要求增加工资的工人达四百多万。英国工人对英镑贬值之后果的强大反抗，已使职工大会最高委员会的右翼首领们（他们曾骗使不久前召开的美国职工大会通过拥护工党政府的冻结工资的政策），面临“被会员群众赶跑的危险”（美联社）。因此，最高委员会不得不在二十日宣布，不能同意英镑贬值，并伪善地要求克利浦斯保证物价不再上涨，企图借此继续欺骗其广大会员。在法国，法共国会党团主席杜克洛已在法郎宣布贬值后致书国民议会议长赫里欧，要求立即召开议会驻会委员会的紧急会议，以讨论法郎贬值问题。法国总工会执行委员会已开会讨论准备提出解冻并增加工资的要求。连社会党的“工人力量”工会也要求解冻工资、管制物价，并宣布将毫不犹疑地与法国总工会联合行动。意大利共产党议员托格里亚蒂、维托里奥与贝森蒂等，已要求国民议会对政府财政经济政策进行总辩论。
