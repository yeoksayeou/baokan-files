Hand-Rolled Cigarette Merchants Must Register, Pay Taxes According to Regulations Before Selling
Editor:

We are engaged in the small business of hand-rolling cigarettes. We roll a few packs of cigarettes and want to sell them in the cigarette market. We don't know how to pay taxes. How much tax should be paid on each box of cigarettes? Please provide an answer!

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Wang Shengchang, Li Wencheng, Zhang Zhenhua
Messrs. Wang Shengchang, Li Wencheng, and Zhang Zhenhua:

Regarding your question about how to pay taxes on cigarettes you roll yourselves, the Tax Bureau's answer is as follows: Editor

I. Those who plan to hand-roll cigarettes must report to the Tax Bureau for registration. Only after being approved for registration and issued a registration certificate can they roll cigarettes. After producing cigarettes, they must still go to the Tax Bureau to pay taxes according to regulations and obtain tax stamps for inspection before they are allowed to sell. The tax amount for August of this year is 20 yuan per box (containing twenty cigarettes).

II. Those who privately manufacture cigarettes without reporting for registration are violating the law and will be banned. Our bureau announced this on May 17th of this year.

III. According to the situation described in your letter, you should quickly go to our bureau to complete the registration procedures. After approval and issuance of a certificate, you can roll cigarettes, pay taxes according to regulations, and sell them freely. If cigarettes are manufactured and sold without paying taxes and are discovered, you will be penalized.

　　手工卷烟商须登记照章完税才准出卖编者先生：
    我们干卷烟的小生意，我们自己卷出几条烟想到烟市卖，不知怎样上税。每一盒烟要上多少税？请予解答！
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　王胜昌、李文诚、张振华王胜昌、李文诚、张振华诸先生：
    你们提出自己卷出几条烟怎样上税的问题，经税务局解答如下：　编者
    一、拟手工卷制纸烟者，须向税务局报请登记，经核准登记，发给登记证始可卷制。制出纸烟，仍赴税务局照章完税发贴查验证后方准销售。本年八月份的税额，每一盒（二十支装）是二十元。
    二、未经报请登记私制纸烟者，是违法的，是要取缔的，我局曾在本年五月十七日公告过了。
    三、按照你们三个人信上说的情形，应当赶快向我局办理登记手续，经核准发证后，就可以卷制照章完税，自由贩卖了，如果制销未经完税的纸烟经查获后，是要受处罚的。
