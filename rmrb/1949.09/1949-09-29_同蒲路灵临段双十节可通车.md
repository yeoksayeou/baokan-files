[Taiyuan Electric] The emergency repair project on the Ling (Shi) to Lin (Fen) section of the southern section of the Tongpu Railway is nearing completion and will be officially opened to traffic on the Double Tenth Festival (October 10th). The section is 108 kilometers long, with many mountains, rivers, bridges, culverts, and embankments along the line, all of which were damaged during the Japanese puppet regime. Since construction began on July 14, thanks to the active repairs by the entire engineering team, 48 bridges of all sizes (including 12 large bridges) and 64 culverts along the entire section have been completely repaired, and all temporary embankments have also been completed. The track laying team has laid tracks to Zhao City, only 38 kilometers away from Linfen, which will be completed within half a month. The Tongpu Railway runs through the central part of Shanxi and is the main transportation artery of Shanxi. Once this section is open to traffic, it will play a significant role in supporting the Northwest front, exchanging materials between the north and south, promoting inland trade, and strengthening urban-rural relations.

　　同蒲路灵临段双十节可通车
    【太原电】同蒲铁路南线灵（石）临（汾）段的抢修工程将告完竣，双十节即可正式通车。该段全长一百零八公里，沿线多山川河流，桥梁、涵洞、堤垣极多，在日伪时期均遭破坏。自七月十四日动工以来，由于工程大队全体积极抢修，已将全段大小桥梁四十八座（其中大桥十二座）、涵洞六十四道全部修好，所有临时堤垣亦已完成。线路队已将铁轨铺至赵城，仅三十八公里即达临汾，半月之内即可全部竣工。按同蒲路横贯山西中部、为山西的交通大动脉，该段一经通车，对支援西北前线，交流南北物资，促进内地贸易及密切城乡关系作用极大。
