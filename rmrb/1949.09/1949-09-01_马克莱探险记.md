　　"The Adventures of Miklouho-Maclay"

    During the grand and splendid International Youth Day evening, I saw "The Adventures of Miklouho-Maclay." This is a film with profound educational significance. It exposes the inside story of imperialism's unscrupulous means of undermining science. It confirms the absurdity of the self-deceiving imperialist claim that the white race is the world's superior race. It shatters the imperialist bourgeoisie's attempt to forever enslave and oppress black people, treating them as slaves. This film exposes the cunning and despicable nature of the bourgeoisie, while also fully revealing the sincere and ardent friendship between black and white people.

    "The Adventures of Miklouho-Maclay" depicts the adventure story of a Soviet anthropologist, Miklouho-Maclay, who, with an iron will and determination, goes to a small island inhabited by black people to study their lives, in order to resolve his question of whether there is any real difference between black and white people.

    The great anthropologist Miklouho-Maclay discovered from the lives of black people that they possess the same creative abilities as white people. It is only because of cultural limitations that they can only use simple production tools, and their lives remain at a relatively primitive stage. However, physiologically, there is no difference between black and white people. The so-called white race being the world's superior race is merely a pretext for the imperialist bourgeoisie to oppress and plunder people of color. The imperialist bourgeoisie cannot tolerate the exposure of their conspiracy. They use theft, arson, debt... all kinds of vicious and ruthless means to threaten and harm him. However, Miklouho-Maclay did not yield. He launched a denunciation of the bourgeoisie's contempt and oppression of black people to London, Paris, Moscow, and the whole world. He made propaganda to the oppressed and exploited people of the world, calling for the union and solidarity of black people. He explained to the world that only the imperialist bourgeoisie are the sole destroyers of the unity and friendship between black and white people…

    Although Miklouho-Maclay struggled in poverty and suffering throughout his life, his contribution to the scientific progress of all mankind is great. On this day of celebrating World Youth Day, in promoting international youth solidarity and friendship, consolidating the friendship of the people of the world, and ensuring the realization of internationalism, this film deeply educated us.

　　“马克莱探险记”
    梦石
    在隆重盛大的国际青年节的晚会上，我看到了“马克莱探险记”。这是一个具有深刻教育意义的影片，它揭露了帝国主义用荒淫无耻的手段破坏科学的内幕，它证实了帝国主义自欺欺人的所谓白种人是世界上第一等人种的荒谬言论，它粉碎了帝国主义资产阶级永远奴役黑人，压迫黑人，把黑人当作奴隶的企图；这个片子暴露了资产阶级的狡猾卑鄙，而另一方面也充份的显露了黑种的人民与白种的人民间忠诚热烈的友爱。
    “马克莱探险记”是描写一个苏联的人类学者—马克莱为了解除他对于黑人与白人间究竟有无区别的疑问，具备着钢铁般的意志和决心，到一个黑人居住的小岛去研究黑人生活的探险故事。
    伟大的人类学者马克莱，从黑人的生活中发现黑人与白人同样具有创造的能力，只是他们因为文化的限制，只能使用简单的生产工具，他们的生活仍停留在较原始的阶段，然而在生理上，黑人与白人是无区别的，所谓白种人是世界上第一等人种，只是帝国主义资产阶级对有色人种压迫、略夺的口实。帝国主义资产阶级对于揭发他们的阴谋，是不能容忍的，他们用偷窃、焚烧、债务……种种凶狠毒辣的手段来威胁他，伤害他，可是马克莱并没有屈服，他向伦敦、向巴黎、向莫斯科、向全世界进行了对资产阶级轻蔑和压迫黑人的揭露，向全世界被压迫被剥削的人们作了要联合黑人，团结黑人的宣传，他向全世界说明只有帝国主义资产阶级是黑人与白人之间团结友爱的唯一破坏者……
    马克莱一生虽在贫穷与苦难中斗争，然而他对于整个人类的科学进步的贡献是伟大的。在庆祝世界青年节的今天，在发扬国际青年团结友爱，巩固世界人民的友谊并保证实现国际主义的意义上，这张影片深深地教育了我们。
