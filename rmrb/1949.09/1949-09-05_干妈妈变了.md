　　Godmother Has Changed
　　Jiao Yubi

　　Little teacher Dong Chunlan had a godmother who was a witch. Her life as a widow for more than ten years was sustained by "shamanistic dances" and deception of the villagers. She had a "God House" at her home, which the comrades from the district dismantled, and she was unhappy, but she still secretly "received the gods." Her second uncle in the east room tried to dissuade her, but to no avail.

　　After school, Chunlan often went to persuade her to change for the better and to stop pretending to be a ghost, but she said it was none of her business; it was a matter for the "gods."

　　Once, Chunlan told her all about a case where a witch was exposed locally. Coincidentally, the village was also putting on a Yangko dance at this time, which also depicted the story of the witch's deception. The godmother also went out to watch, and as she watched, she thought, "What my goddaughter is saying is true." Many people watching the fun glanced at her after watching the Yangko, and the young men deliberately said some playful things to her, which made her feel flustered. As they talked, she felt her face burning.

　　After watching the Yangko, Chunlan said to her, "Hurry up and reflect on yourself, or the masses will become aware and oppose you!"

　　The godmother listened, as if agreeing, but also as if having some concerns. She was stunned for a moment and said, "What should I do then?" Chunlan said, "If you've done wrong, just correct it, and everyone will forgive you." From then on, she never "received the gods" again.

　　In addition to "shamanistic dances," the godmother also believed in fate. She had been a widow since she was in her twenties, and she said it was her destiny. She had a very tempting vegetable garden, which was seized by the local bully, Dong Ziming. She also sold a small donkey, but Dong Ziming insisted that her husband owed him money when he was alive and deducted all the donkey money. For the past ten years or so, the godmother would tremble all over whenever she saw him. The godmother felt in her heart that this was due to her "fate."

　　In this year (1944), the poor people in the village who were oppressed by Dong Ziming wanted to reason with him and settle accounts. Therefore, Chunlan wanted to mobilize the godmother to also complain and settle accounts, pour out her grievances, and get back her vegetable garden and small donkey. But Chunlan felt that she was just a young girl, would she listen to what she said? So, she first mobilized her mother and taught her what to say. The mother listened and started chatting with the godmother. The mother said, "The crops this year are not good, but that vegetable garden is growing well..." Before the mother could finish her words, the godmother's tears streamed down. Chunlan watched from the side, feeling both uncomfortable and strangely pleased, so she interjected, "The villagers are going to settle accounts with the bully. You've been bullied by him for more than ten years, and now you're still afraid of getting burned and don't dare to speak up. Not only are you suffering losses and poverty, but people will also say you're a lackey!"

　　Chunlan and her mother talked for a while and then went home. The next morning, the godmother went to the Peasants' Rescue Association to register to settle accounts with the bully Dong Ziming.

　　At the grievance meeting, the godmother spoke. The godmother never used to talk much, but today she didn't stop. She spoke even more than the teachers at school. She was really suffering, and as she spoke, she shed tears and wiped her nose, and the listeners also began to sob. The aunts and grandmothers all lowered their heads and picked up the corners of their coats to wipe their eyes, and the eyes of the second uncle in the east room and others were also red.

　　From then on, the godmother went to the vegetable garden several times a day, sometimes squatting down to pull weeds. When you went to her house to play, before you even reached the yard, you could hear the bright and shiny little donkey's lips making a "blurp" sound.

　　The godmother was very clear-headed. She knew that she could achieve this state of affairs thanks to this young girl telling her about the Communist Party's principles. Therefore, she was willing to listen to whatever her goddaughter said and often told Chunlan, "If you have anything else to say, just tell me. You're with the teachers at school, so you know more things than I do!"

　　After the godmother stopped "shamanistic dances," Chunlan went to play more and more often. The godmother now had food and clothing, which was satisfying, but in Chunlan's opinion, it was still not perfect. Why was the godmother still panting heavily? Oh! Chunlan seemed to have guessed eight or nine out of ten. The godmother was lonely and all alone, and she had to do everything herself: washing pots and cooking, going up and down the mountains, pushing the mill and pressing the stone roller, feeding the chickens and filling the pen... up and down, how could she do without her? With everything weighing on her, she was really exhausted.

　　Usually, the second uncle from the east room often came to the godmother's house to chat. He was a bachelor, and it seemed that the two of them got along very well. Chunlan couldn't help but laugh when she thought of this.

　　One evening, Chunlan asked her, "Godmother, do you think people are governed by fate, or by themselves?"

　　"What fate or no fate! If I had always been governed by fate, would I be here today? Your godmother has finally come to her senses, child!"

　　"Godmother! I see you busy all day long, doing the housework, and worrying about the melons in the mountains, and when you're busy in the mountains, you're worrying about the chickens at home. I think you're really suffering!"

　　"What else can I do!" The godmother gasped.

　　"Why don't you find someone to help you out?"

　　"Find who? Who can neglect themselves to work for others!"

　　"Godmother! Now it's a new society, no one will laugh at you. Find a man to come home, he can work in the fields, shelter from the wind and rain, and you can do production at home, sewing and mending, inside and out, relaxed and happy! If you rely on yourself alone, you'll do this and lose that, and no one will pity you even if you die of exhaustion! Besides, who will take care of you if there are any disasters? In our new society, only the old stubborn and feudal people will laugh at you!" Chunlan spoke like she was giving a lecture at school, saying everything that came to her mind. She looked at the godmother, and, um! There was a hint of something. The godmother didn't speak, but her upper eyelids were batting her lower eyelids, and her mind seemed to be racing. Seeing this, Chunlan simply said everything without holding back: "Godmother! Do you think my second uncle in the east room is suitable?"

　　Ah! The godmother grinned and glanced at Chunlan. She had spoken to her heart, and she was still shy at such an old age. Look, her face was red.

　　"Godmother! I'm your goddaughter. Think about it, have I ever done anything that displeased you?" Chunlan knew that she would definitely not say anything else, but it would not be easy to get her to say it immediately because she was still feudal. Thinking about this, she jumped off the kang: "Godmother! Let's just do it this way, don't be feudal!" Saying this, she jumped and ran out.

　　Just as she ran to the back of the house, she suddenly stopped. This little Chunlan tiptoed onto the mound behind the house, raised her heels, stuck her index finger in her mouth, picked out some saliva, moistened the window paper, poked a small hole, aimed her right eye at it, and looked inside. The light of the small bean oil lamp in the room dimly illuminated the godmother's relaxed face. She blinked her eyes without moving, looking at the opposite wall, lost in thought.

　　Chunlan breathed a sigh of relief and quietly slipped down again. In the shadows, she jumped and walked into the gate of the second uncle's house in the east room.

　　Strike while the iron is hot. The next day, Chunlan ran to the homes of the chairman of the farmers' association and the director of the women's association to ask them to be matchmakers. They did not decline and accepted the request after clarifying the details.

　　After school in the afternoon, Chunlan carried her small schoolbag and went to find the chairman of the farmers' association without going home. The chairman of the farmers' association smiled when he saw her and nodded at her, pulling her hand. Dong Chunlan understood what this nod meant, and her face was also filled with a big smile.

　　A few days later, in the godmother's vegetable garden, not only did she often go, but the second uncle also often looked around, catching insects and weeding. Every time Chunlan saw her, her clothes were clean and tidy, her eyes sparkled, and a clear little bracket was added to the corner of her mouth, which was bigger and clearer than the one in the arithmetic textbook. When she talked to her mother or Chunlan herself, she always grinned and loved to tell others about the happy life of her new family.

　　Chunlan's godmother has changed, and Chunlan's godmother is happy.

　　End of August 1949 in Beiping.

　　干妈妈变了
    矫于碧
    小先生董春兰有个干妈妈是个巫婆，她十几年的寡居岁月，就是依靠“跳大神”哄骗庄户人的东西来维持生活的。她家有个“神仙楼”，区上的同志给她拆掉了，她不高兴，还是偷偷摸摸地“上神”，东屋二叔劝她也无效。
    学校放了学，春兰常去劝她，叫她改好，别再装神装鬼的，她说这不关她事，是“神”的事。
    有一次，春兰把当地一个揭穿巫婆的事情源源本本的告诉了她，可巧村上也正在这时候办了出秧歌，也是演的那个巫婆骗人的事情，干妈也出去看，看着看着，她想，这和干女儿说的都不假。很多看热闹的人，看看秧歌又瞅瞅她，年轻的小伙子还故意说几句俏皮话给她听，刺挠的她心里都发慌，说着说着，她觉得脸上好象有点火辣辣的发烧。
    看罢了秧歌以后，春兰向她说：“赶快反省反省吧，要不，群众觉悟了，会反对你！”
    干妈妈听了，象是同意，又象有些什么顾虑，她呆了一会儿说：“那怎么办呢？”春兰说：“错了就改，大家都能原谅你。”从此以后，她再没上过“神”。
    干妈除了“跳大神”以外，还相信命运，她从二十多岁的时候起就守寡，她说这是命该如此。她有块很馋人的菜园地，被恶霸董子明给霸占去了，她还卖了一头小毛驴，董子明硬说她男人在世的时候欠他的债，把驴价也全部克扣去了，过去这十几年，干妈一见到他，浑身就打颤颤，干妈心眼里也觉得这是“八字”带的。
    这年（一九四四年），村里受董子明欺压的穷人都要和他讲理算帐，因此，春兰想去动员干妈妈也去诉苦算帐，倒倒苦水，要回她的菜园地和小毛驴来。可是春兰觉得自己还是个黄毛丫头，说的话她能听吗？于是，先动员好了妈妈，又教给妈妈应当怎么个说法，妈妈听了就去跟她拉起呱来。妈妈说：“今年的庄稼不收成，数着那块菜园地长的好……”妈妈的话没说完，干妈的泪水就刷刷地滚出来啦。春兰在旁边看了，心里又不舒服又怪美美的，就也插上嘴去：“村里人都要和恶霸算帐去，你受了他十几年的欺负，现在还怕烧着怕烫着的不敢说话，吃亏受穷不说，人家还要说你是狗腿子咧！”
    春兰和妈妈又在那说了一阵子话，也就回家来了。第二天早晨，干妈就到农救会去登记要跟恶霸董子明算帐。
    诉苦会上，干妈妈发了言。干妈妈向来没老些话，今天可没有个了时价，比起学校里老师的话还多。她真难受呀，说着说着就泪一把鼻一把的，听的人也跟着抽搐起来。婶婶大娘们都搭拉下了脑袋，拾起袄角角来擦眼皮皮，东屋二叔叔还有别人的眼圈也红了。
    从那以后，干妈每天总要到菜园地里去几趟，有时也蹲下来拔拔草什么的。到她家玩的时候，不等走到院里，就听到浑身亮光光的小毛驴的嘴唇打“吐噜”。
    干妈心里很透亮，她知道她能得到这步光景，都是亏了这个黄毛丫头把共产党的主张告诉了她。所以干女儿说什么她都肯听，也常嘱咐春兰说：“你再有个什么话就和我说说呀，你在学校里守着老师，知道的事情总比我多！”
    干妈从不“跳大神”了以后，春兰去玩的次数就越发多了。干妈现在有吃有穿了，这虽说是称心了，但在春兰看起来，还是美中不足，干妈为啥还常喘粗气？噢！春兰象是猜中了个八九十来成。干妈孤寡伶仃的，一个人什么事都要动手：刷锅做饭，上山下坡，推磨压碾，喂鸡填栏……上上下下，那样不用她能成？一条肠子八下挂，也真够她累的了。
    平常，东屋二叔也常到干妈家来拉呱，二叔是个光棍汉，看样子，两个人象很合得来。春兰想到这里，不由的就想笑出来。
    一天晚上，春兰问她：“干妈呀！你说人是由命呢，还是由人呢？”
    “什么命不命的！我要是老由命由命的，还会有今儿格？你干妈妈不是在早啦，这阵子心里识数啦，孩子！”
    “干妈呀！我看你一天到黑没死没活的直忙活，做着家里的事，又挂挂山里的瓜，在山里忙活着，又挂挂家里的鸡，我看真够你受的！”
    “那有什么法子！”干妈喘了口粗气。
    “你不好找个人帮帮你的忙？”
    “找谁？谁能不顾自己来忙活别人！”
    “干妈呀！现在是新社会啦，没人笑话，找个男人来家，他在地里做活，挡风遮雨，你在家里生产，缝缝补补，里里外外，松松闲闲，快快活活的多好！光靠你自己，做了这就丢了那，累死也没个人可怜！再说要是有个三灾八难的谁看顾你？咱这个新社会，只有那老顽固老封建人家才笑话咧！”春兰象在学校里演讲似的，把她小脑子里想到的一气都说出来。她看看干妈，嗯！有个谱，干妈不说话，只是上眼皮打着下眼皮，脑子里象在打转转。春兰看这样子，爽性一滴不留的都说出来啦：“干妈呀！你看东屋我二叔合适不？”
    啊！干妈裂着嘴啾了春兰一眼，说到她心里去啦，那么大的年纪，还害羞呢，你看，脸都红啦。
    “干妈呀！我是你的干闺女，你想想，我和你说的事，那件使你不满意过？”春兰知道她准没二句话说，但是要想马上从她嘴里说出，一时她还封建，怕不大容易，想着也就跳下炕来：“干妈呀！就这么的吧，别封建啦！”说着，就一蹦一蹦的跑出来了。
    刚跑到房子后面，忽然又停下来，这小春兰就蹑手蹑脚的踏上房后的土堆，翘起脚跟，把食指伸进嘴里挑出点唾沫濡湿了窗户纸，捅了个小窟窿，对准了右眼，向里面望。屋里小豆油灯的灯光黑黝黝的照着干妈妈舒舒展展的脸蛋，她一动也不动的眨着眼睛向着对面的墙壁，若有所思的在出神。
    春兰嘘了口气，又轻轻地遛下来，在黑影里，又一跳一跳地走进了东屋二叔家的街门里。
    做事象打铁，打铁要趁热，第二天，春兰就跑到农会主任和妇会主任的家里，请他俩个做介绍人，他俩并不推辞的问明了原委就接受了要求。
    放了晌学，春兰提着小书包没顾得回家就找农会主任去了。农会主任见了她笑着扯着她的手向她点头示意，董春兰明白这点头是表示的什么意思，脸上也跟着推满了一大堆的笑意。
    不几天以后，干妈妈的菜园地里，不光她自己常去，二叔叔也常在里边看这看那捉虫锄地的。春兰每次看到她，她的穿戴都是一干二净，眼珠铄铄发光，嘴角边也添上了一道清＠的小括弧，比算术课本上的又大又清楚。当她和妈妈或者春兰自己说起话来时，总是裂着嘴，爱把她的新家庭的美满生活说给别人听。
    春兰的干妈妈变了，春兰的干妈妈舒心了。
    一九四九年八月尾在北平。
