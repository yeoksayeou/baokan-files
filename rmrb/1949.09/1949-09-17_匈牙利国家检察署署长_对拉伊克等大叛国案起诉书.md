　　　　Rajk, the Principal Traitor
　　　　Long Directed by German Nazi Police

　　First, A. László Rajk, born in 1909 in Szliacsnia (a section of the telegraph is unclear, but it seems to indicate that he was arrested in Budapest in 1930 for distributing communist leaflets, and then defected, becoming an informant with the help of police Captain Lajos Pokorny. Afterwards, while studying at university, he was a police informant and provocateur – translator's note); In 1932, he reported Gyula Scheffler, Károly Olt and their comrades to the police station. In 1933, he reported Szilki, Jenő Zirzl, and their organization to the police station. In 1934, the police station sent Rajk to work among construction workers. At that time, there was a strong communist organization among construction workers. In 1935, two hundred people were arrested during the construction workers' strike because of Rajk's betrayal.

　　After this, Rajk disappeared for some time: the police station sent him to Czechoslovakia to spy on the foreign liaison of the Hungarian Communist Party. After the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, Rajk was assigned by the secret police to Spain and reported those in the Hungarian Communist Party who participated in the liberation war, while attempting to develop sabotage activities in the Rakosi camp. Rajk's provocative activities in Spain were noticed. An investigation began: he was banned from holding any position and later expelled from the party. Before the failure of the liberation struggle in Spain, Rajk fled to France, where, in the international concentration camps of Saint Cyprien, Gurs, and Vernet, he met agents of the Yugoslav foreign intelligence service, such as Biberle, Nagy Kosta, Goszjak, Maszlarić, Rulazović, and others. Like Rajk, they had engaged in espionage and intelligence activities in Spain and later in the concentration camps. French and American intelligence agencies and the German secret police were all mixed in these concentration camps. Field, one of the heads of the American intelligence agency "Strategic Services Unit" in Switzerland, visited Rajk and told him that he was under special orders from his superiors to help Rajk return to his country. In the Vernet concentration camp, a German delegation also arrived, and the head of the delegation, a major of the secret police, summoned Rajk and informed him that he was to be sent to Hungary to "work."

　　After returning to Hungary, Rajk immediately reported to Peter Hain, the head of the political police who was the police captain during the Szálasi era. Rajk's confession on this point is as follows: "I told him everything I knew in Spain and France. Hain told me that German secret police officers helped me at his request."

　　Rajk, whose secret activities were still unknown in Hungary, was instructed by Hain to send the informer Heil into the underground communist movement. Due to Heil's denunciation, the communist secretary Zoltán Schönherz was arrested and executed, and Rósa was killed. In order not to expose Rajk, the police also arrested him, but he was only sentenced to six months in prison. In October 1944, Szálasi's military organization arrested Rajk along with others. In January 1945, he was tried by the military court of Sopronkőhida. The prosecutor of the court, Dr. János, testified on this point as follows: "During the trial, Rajk, in order to defend himself, narrated that he had a long period of contact with the police station and had made important achievements in many cases."

　　During the secret trial, Rajk's brother, Andor Rajk, a member of the Szálasi government, appeared in court to defend him. Rajk was released, and his case was transferred to the civil court, which later declared Rajk innocent in Bavaria, while the other four defendants in the case were executed.

　　Thereafter, Rajk was an informant and denouncer for the Horthy police and the German secret police, thus committing war crimes and anti-popular crimes.

　　　　Infiltrating the Government to Engage in Espionage
　　　　Colluding with Tito's Followers to Oppose the Soviet Union and the People

　　B. At the end of 1945, Rajk returned to Hungary. He was able to conceal his past and disguise himself as a communist who had participated in the Spanish war and had been persecuted. He became the secretary of the Budapest Party organization of the Hungarian Communist Party, a member of parliament, Minister of the Interior, then Minister of Foreign Affairs. Naturally, he continued his previous activities. Rajk's confession regarding this activity is as follows: "I regularly and systematically informed American spies of all matters in the Ministry of Interior and later in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs."

　　The American intelligence agency stationed in Hungary increasingly valued the Yugoslav spies, the secret envoys of Tito, who were spies from foreign intelligence agencies. Shamelessly exploiting the sincere brotherly feelings of the Hungarian democratic state towards the Yugoslav people, Tito's diplomatic representatives and other official representatives who had infiltrated Hungary began to establish their own spy network in the most unscrupulous manner in early 1945.

　　First, they used Rajk, whose previous police work and espionage activities were well known to them.

　　Rajk readily handed over all kinds of intelligence to Colonel Čizmić, the head of the Yugoslav military delegation, Mrazović, the Yugoslav minister, Brankov, the Yugoslav chargé d'affaires in Hungary, and many Yugoslav spies he associated with. Rajk handed over secret intelligence about the situation in Hungary and the situation of the Soviet army and Soviet diplomatic personnel to Yugoslav spies, which he had access to as Minister of the Interior. In this way, he handed over intelligence about Ferenc Nagy's treasonous conspiracy to Yugoslav spies, who immediately passed it on to the American mission. He ordered his deputy, Dr. András Tebyini, to provide Yugoslav spies with all the secret intelligence they requested. In accordance with the instructions of the Yugoslav intelligence agency, he appointed the spy György Dérsznis as the director of the press office of the Ministry of the Interior, knowing that the latter had worked in the British intelligence service. Dérsznis made communication between Rajk and the spies working in the Yugoslav mission easier.

　　Rajk, as a minister and member of parliament, that is, as a state public servant, abused his official privileges and handed over secret intelligence to foreign spies. This greatly violated the interests of the Hungarian state, engaged in espionage activities, and committed treason.

　　C. The importance attached to Yugoslav spies is related to the fact that in liberated Yugoslavia, American Yugoslav spies, traitors, and Trotskyites, people like Rajk, gained power. Among them, about one hundred and fifty spies were sent to Yugoslavia by representatives of the German secret police in 1941 at the same time as Rajk to engage in espionage work. These spies constituted the main body of Tito's confidants, and they systematically pushed out honest and loyal people from the government, who were all Yugoslav patriots loyal to the people.

　　Encouraged by this success, the American imperialists even put forward the task of winning over the people's democratic countries to their side with the help of Tito's followers. Rajk's confession regarding this point is as follows: "Ranković, the Yugoslav Minister of the Interior, told me frankly that the people's democratic countries must unite with Yugoslavia and that Tito should be their leader."

　　In order to achieve this goal, Yugoslav, American, and other countries' intelligence agencies supported Rajk in various ways. In November 1946, Dr. Szőnyi was placed under Rajk's command. Szőnyi, in accordance with the instructions of Allen Dulles, the head of the Strategic Services Unit of the American intelligence organization, organized Hungarian Trotskyites exiled in Switzerland into a spy group. In the winter of 1944-45, with the help of Tito's agents in Switzerland and France, Dulles transported this group of spies to Hungary via Belgrade on American planes, disguised as the Yugoslav military delegation, infiltrating the rear of the Soviet army. In the summer of 1946, Yugoslav agents added Pálffy, a fascist officer of the Horthy army, to Rajk as an assistant. According to his own confession, since the summer of 1945, Pálffy had been recruited as a Yugoslav spy, pretending to be a communist. Subsequently, he became a general, commander of the border guard, and later Deputy Minister of National Defense. With the help of this accomplice, Rajk established a spider web-like organization. He placed imperialist agents in various high positions as much as possible, especially those who were previously Trotskyites, traitors, and spies. This is how the leadership of the police and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs fell into the hands of Szász and Major Ferenczy, the former being a spy sent from South Africa to Hungary by British Intelligence, and the latter being an agent of the American "Central Intelligence Agency" espionage organization. Marshal, a spy from the French Second Bureau, was responsible for political education in the police; Trotskyites Oszkó and Mátyás became police colonels. Rajk placed Beck, Ráth, Kovács, Garlecsics, and his other old friends—spies—in the political police bureau. Korondy, a former gendarmerie captain as a police colonel, was ordered to organize former gendarmes and Horthy officers into special units of the Ministry of the Interior.

　　　　Placing Henchmen in State Organs

　　Szőnyi tried to place his henchmen in state organs, economic positions, and the Hungarian Communist Party. On the other hand, Pálffy filled the Hungarian army with fascist officers and Horthy officers. Rajk and his gang systematically excluded democratic personnel, especially workers and peasants, from the Hungarian police, army, and state organs. At the same time, they released prisoners, spies, and traitors who had infiltrated there from detention camps.

　　They also engaged in extensive political activities. Rajk's wife was the general secretary of the Hungarian Democratic Women's League. They spread their influence to students and youth through the National Committee of People's University, which was widely supported by Rajk through the Ministry of the Interior. Rajk, as an "honorary worker in the construction industry," also tried to spread his influence into the trade unions through the construction workers' union. Rajk also served as the chairman of the Hungarian-Yugoslav Association, etc.

　　In coordination with Rajk's organization, Yugoslavia also established its own spy organization. They used the trust of the Hungarian People's Democratic Republic in them to infiltrate not only Hungarian state organs but also Hungarian political parties, economic organs, and people's organizations. Their organization was so widespread and vast that as early as the autumn of 1947, they adopted the policy of subverting the Hungarian People's Democratic Republic with the help of Rajk and his gang.

　　The former Yugoslav Chargé d'Affaires in Hungary, Brankov, testified on this point as follows: "Our intelligence organization gradually extended into all departments of state organs, the army, and the police. Since 1945, our spies have infiltrated the leadership organizations of the Hungarian Communist Party and the Social Democratic Party, as well as the leadership organizations of many people's organizations. With the help of the spy network in the Hungarian state organs and the army, the Yugoslav government launched a wide range of sabotage activities against the Hungarian government. Because of this, Ranković, the Yugoslav Minister of the Interior, was able to issue specific instructions, according to Tito's plan, through the spy network to overthrow the Hungarian government and change the Hungarian state system."

　　Tito's visit to Hungary in December 1947 was aimed at preparing for the implementation of this plan. This visit, which in many ways resembled the invasion of Budapest by a conqueror, was carried out according to a meticulously planned plan by the leaders of the Yugoslav government; (half a sentence is unclear).

　　　　Conspiring with Tito to Invade Neighboring Countries

　　On his way back from Budapest, Tito stayed in Kélebia on the Hungarian-Yugoslav border for a day under the pretext of hunting. Hungarian Minister of the Interior Rajk was also on his train. Before boarding the train, Rajk had repeatedly held preliminary talks with Tito and the leaders of the Yugoslav government. At the Kélebia railway station, Ranković, the Yugoslav Minister of the Interior, invited Rajk to meet in Tito's car. Ranković, through his interpreter Brankov, told Rajk in detail about the work that had been completed. According to Rajk's confession, Ranković said, "The plan is to incorporate the people's democratic countries into the Yugoslav sphere of influence centered on Belgrade by secretly paralyzing the vigilance of neighboring governments."

　　The so-called Balkan Trade Union League, Balkan Sports League, Balkan Youth Workers' League, Balkan Women's League, etc., all served this purpose, with Belgrade as their center. Regarding Hungary's domestic policy, Ranković gave Rajk the following instructions: "Rely on the chauvinists in the army, the police, and state organs, as well as the petty bourgeois forces in the cities, especially in the countryside."

　　Ranković told Rajk Tito's instructions, according to which Rajk must adopt the policy of eliminating the true leaders of the Hungarian state and the Communist Party and then seizing control of the Hungarian leadership organs himself. Rajk accepted this task and intensified his activities.

　　Since March 1948, more and more facts have shown that the Yugoslav-American plan was beginning to be exposed. Rajk, as a member of the Political Bureau of the Hungarian Communist Party, was notified that the Cominform intended to expose Tito's betrayal. Rajk notified Tito's followers there of this preparation one by one.

　　The publication of the Cominform resolution exposed Tito's followers' plan and made it impossible to realize. In view of this, Tito's followers notified Rajk that it was necessary to arrange a secret meeting between Rajk and Ranković, the Yugoslav Minister of the Interior, in order to formulate a strategy in the changed situation. This secret meeting was held in early October 1948 near Bácsalmás, on the hunting ground of the landowner Anaclin (a supporter of Horthy). With the help of Pálffy, the commander of the border guards, Ranković and his two attendants illegally crossed the border and met with Rajk, who was brought to the meeting place by Mrazović, the Yugoslav Minister to Budapest, and his wife, Györgyi Tarižnyász (a teacher in the Bácsalmás region).

　　Ranković presented Rajk with a new plan and emphasized that the plan was personally drafted by Tito and that only Đilas and Kardelj knew about it besides him. He told Rajk that after the Cominform resolution, a new approach must be taken to achieve the original goal. He presented Tito's "brilliant" plan, how Tito would gradually turn the Yugoslav people against the Soviet Union and turn them towards the Western imperialist camp, and at the same time, how Tito intended to strengthen the reactionary forces within the people's democratic countries and ensure the consolidation of their organizations, and how Tito intended to pull these countries to the imperialist side and make them anti-Soviet.

　　Ranković said, "Tito has put forward three tasks to achieve this goal in the new situation. First, mobilize the Yugoslav people against the Soviet Union; second, increase and organize anti-Soviet forces in the people's democratic countries; and third, take advantage of the differences between the Soviet Union and the United States and Britain on international issues. On the latter issue, we must rely on the support of the great powers in the struggle against the Soviet Union's colonial policy. ... Tito brilliantly solved this problem by formulating a plan that could gradually eliminate the pro-Soviet sentiment of the Yugoslav people."

　　In pointing out the main content of this plan, Rajk confessed: "The main principle of this brilliant plan, as Ranković told me, is: first, to criticize the Cominform resolution, and then describe the resolution as merely slander (a small section is missing). On the contrary, during this period, we will claim to be friendly to the Soviet Union...". He continued: "Then, we will gradually, but more firmly, begin to say that the impossibility of realizing Yugoslavia's five-year plan and the socialist construction plan, especially the impossibility of realizing our promises to raise the living standards of the masses, should be blamed on the Soviet Union. ... Ranković said that this propaganda would undoubtedly be very effective. With its help, the friendly feelings of our people towards the Soviet Union will turn into hatred ... Ranković said that according to Tito's plan, this propaganda will pave the way for presenting Tito's tendency towards Western countries rather than the Soviet Union in front of the masses."

　　　　Plotting to Assassinate the Leaders of the Hungarian People
　　　　Attempting to Overthrow the People's Regime by Armed Force

　　As for Hungary, Ranković told Rajk that Tito "will launch a vigorous campaign against the Hungarian government and its national leaders in the near future. Rákosi will be accused of revisionism, and under his leadership, the Hungarian government wants to divide the Yugoslav territory inhabited by Hungarian residents. When differences therefore arise between the people of Yugoslavia and Hungary, this issue will be raised in parliament at the appropriate time. This action will be accompanied by border incidents, and Yugoslavia will blame Hungary for the incidents."

　　According to the plan put forward by Ranković, these border incidents will serve as a formal pretext for Yugoslavia to carry out military intervention in Hungary and armed occupation of parts of Hungarian territory. This intervention will take place when the Soviet Union is busy with certain international complex issues. Part of this military operation will be Yugoslav troops in Hungarian uniforms crossing the border, and gendarmes, Szálasi followers, and Horthy followers gathered in the British and American occupation zones will also enter Hungary in Hungarian uniforms from Yugoslavia.

　　This plan included the "physical elimination" of certain Hungarian government members, primarily Rákosi, Farkas, and Gerő. Rajk panicked and said they were very experienced in this regard. Ranković reassured him, saying, "Certain enemies of Tito can tell you very well about the means that Tito and he (Ranković) use to remove their enemies."

　　Ranković suggested to Rajk that the task of assassinating the leading ministers of the Hungarian government be assigned to Pálffy and Shyamann in the army.

　　Ranković said, "It should be noted that these assassinations should be varied, for example: this person ××, another commits suicide, ×××× suddenly dies of illness, and then makes appropriate explanations, such as attempting to escape, etc." (This section is unclear). In conclusion, Ranković spoke of Tito's instructions and conditions: "Yugoslavia's assistance obliges the new Hungarian government to have natural obligations to Yugoslavia that need not be discussed. Under the jurisdiction of myself and Anton Rob, internal and external policy issues and Hungarian military issues – everything must be coordinated with the interests of Yugoslavia. Secondly, Hungarian industry must make certain sacrifices to complete Yugoslavia's economic plan."

　　Ranković stated his plans regarding the new government. Rajk would serve as prime minister of the new government, Anton Rob (one of the heads of Yugoslavia's intelligence agency "Uba" in Hungary) would serve as minister of the interior, and Yugoslav spy György Pálffy would serve as minister of defense. Ranković continued: "Tito would not object if social democratic leaders who fled to the West and several confidants of Ferenc Nagy participated in the future government." Part of the political instruction also required Rajk to rely on the supporters of Horthy and Szálasi, Catholic reactionaries, and wealthy peasants, and he emphasized the example of Yugoslavia in this regard, "where Tito did not carry out a struggle against wealthy peasants." Finally, Ranković added that he was willing to hand over his military experts for armed overthrow of the government to Rajk.

　　Rajk accepted Tito's execution order. Upon arriving in Budapest, he instructed György Pálffy to conduct various armed preparations in the army to overthrow the republic. Pálffy, who had already learned of the plan proposed by Ranković through his own channels, informed Rajk that he had begun preparations and was familiar with the details of the armed operation plan.

　　Rajk also instructed Szőnyi to make preparations—to prepare a meeting aimed at transferring the leadership of the Hungarian working class into Rajk's hands. On the other hand, Ranković sent two political assassins, two veteran executioners, Imvanović and Jójkić, to Hungary as diplomats. He gave them the mission of preparing to assassinate Premier Rákosi.

　　All these plans were shattered because the government took measures to suppress reactionaries and spies. As a result, a considerable number of Rajk's supporters were removed from their positions in the army, police, and government agencies. In mid-May, the arrest of the conspiratorial traitors began.

　　The above facts show that Rajk acted as the founder of an organization aimed at forcibly overthrowing the democratic state and the republican government established by Law No. 1 of 1946, and constituted a crime by leading this organization.

　　　　Pálffy
　　　　Planning Armed Overthrow of His Own Government and Providing Military Intelligence to the Tito Group

　　Second, A. György Pálffy, born in 1909 in a wealthy bourgeois family. Before World War II, after graduating from the Ludovika Academy, he served in the Italian Fascist army for one year. After returning to his country, he was a stubborn fascist. He served as an officer in Horthy's army and participated in the occupation of Ukraine, for which he received a certificate of commendation from the Ministry of Defense. Due to his wife's family background, he was forced to resign from the army, which later became his excuse for joining the new army in early 1945 as an "anti-German" officer. By the summer of 1945, he was already a spy for the Yugoslav intelligence agency. In the same year, he established a relationship with Rajk. In several discussions with Rajk, Pálffy understood and agreed to the aims of the organization aimed against the state and the people. Pálffy's task included the military leadership of this organization. With Rajk's consent, he sheltered Horthy's fascist officers in the army, promoted their positions, and appointed those he knew would blindly obey his vile purposes and instructions to important leadership positions. In 1947, Pálffy, on Rajk's orders, intensified his activities, organizing inspections and exercises related to the preparation of armed conspiracies, etc.

　　With the help of Colonel Lozić, the Yugoslav military attaché in Budapest, Pálffy established a relationship with Colonel Nédelković of Yugoslavia. They met in Rome in November 1947 at a guerrilla congress, where Nédelković conveyed Tito's direct instructions to Pálffy. He assured Pálffy that Tito's goals, with American support, would be achieved.

　　In October 1948, after the secret meeting between Rajk and Yugoslav Minister of the Interior Ranković in Bácsalmás, Pálffy intensified the armed preparations for the overthrow of the republic. He prepared and formulated on paper a plan that he believed could be implemented with ten battalions. Pálffy assigned these battalions to seize the most important public buildings, post offices, radio stations, the central committee of the party, and the industrial centers of the provinces. Pálffy drew up a plan to assassinate government ministers Rákosi, Farkas, and Gerő. He assigned this task to former gendarmerie captain, police colonel Korondy, intending to place the special team composed of Horthy officers under his command in addition to the special battalion Korondy had already organized. This plan was on a map of Greater Budapest, hidden in the safe in Pálffy's office, until he learned that his accomplices had been arrested. With the assistance of his secretary, Rosenfeld, Pálffy destroyed the plan.

　　Thus, Pálffy committed a crime by organizing an organization aimed at forcibly overthrowing the democratic state and the republic established in accordance with Law No. 1 of 1946.

　　B. Since 1945, Pálffy has been an agent of the Yugoslav intelligence service. He regularly sent secret documents and intelligence about the army to the head of the Yugoslav intelligence organization in Hungary and Laszlo Brankov, the counselor of the Yugoslav embassy. He issued instructions to employees of the military and political departments, ordering them to provide Brankov with the information he requested. Pálffy carried out this espionage activity for Colonel Lozić, the Yugoslav military attaché, and after Lozić left, for Colonel Žokel, the counselor of the Yugoslav embassy.

　　Pálffy, as a lieutenant general and inspector, abused his official position and sent secret intelligence about the Hungarian state's military and economic situation to representatives of foreign countries. Therefore, he committed a major crime against the interests of the state.

　　　　Brankov
　　　　Is the Head of the Tito Group's Official Espionage in Hungary

　　Third, A. László Brankov was the main agent of Ranković, the Yugoslav Minister of the Interior, in Hungary. At first, he was the head of the Yugoslav military mission, then a counselor of the Yugoslav embassy, and then the Yugoslav chargé d'affaires. As Brankov confessed, before being sent to Hungary, when Colonel Obcizmed, the head of the Yugoslav military mission, mentioned Tito's order in early 1945, he put forward the mission of the mission members as follows: "Tito, Kardelj and Ranković expect the members of the mission to use the opportunity of their stay in Hungary to collect intelligence on the political and economic measures of the Hungarian government and to carry out espionage work on the Soviet troops stationed in Hungary. He told us that we must establish close ties with British and American representatives and not fall under the influence of the Soviet side of the Allied Control Commission, especially Marshal Voroshilov."

　　Brankov followed this point by maintaining contact with Rajk, Pálffy, and other elements opposed to the Hungarian democratic state for many years. He brought Pálffy into contact with Rajk. He coordinated the activities of Rajk, Pálffy, and others' organizations. He directed the espionage activities of Anton Rob, who at his request was elected as the secretary of the Democratic Alliance of South Slavs in Hungary and became a member of parliament. Brankov acted as an interpreter during the negotiations between Rajk and Ranković in Kélebia in December 1947. As a reliable agent of Tito and Ranković, he was given the task of intensifying the implementation of the plan to overthrow the Hungarian Republic and controlling this matter. When Brankov encountered difficulties in playing this role after the publication of the Cominform resolution, he declared his opposition to Tito on Ranković's direct orders, and after publishing a public statement on this issue, he stayed in Hungary and refused to return to Yugoslavia. But in reality, he secretly continued his activities aimed at overthrowing the Hungarian Republic. Thus, Brankov committed a crime by directing the organization aimed at forcibly overthrowing the democratic state and the government of the democratic republic established in accordance with Law No. 1 of 1946.

　　B. Brankov was the head of the official espionage organization of Yugoslavia in Hungary. For more than four years, he had regularly obtained secret intelligence from Rajk, Pálffy, and several other recruited agents. He received direct instructions from Tito regarding carrying out this activity. He was Tito's most active agent.

　　Brankov consistently engaged in espionage work during his stay in Hungary.

　　C. In the summer of ××, Brankov summoned Borov, a member of the Yugoslav espionage organization and the press counselor of the Yugoslav mission in Budapest, and informed him that Miloš Mojzić, one of the leaders of the Yugoslavs in Hungary, had declared his support for the Cominform resolution and that he might expose the activities of Tito's supporters in Hungary. Brankov instructed Borov to persuade Mojzić to abandon this intention, and if Mojzić insisted on his position, to kill him. Subsequently, Brankov took the gun of Mrazović, the Yugoslav minister, and gave it to Borov, who fired several shots in Mojzić's room on the evening of June 10, 1948, killing Mojzić.

　　Thus, Brankov persuaded Borov to kill Mojzić, committing the crime of inciting murder.

　　　　Szőnyi
　　　　Colluding with American Spies and Providing Intelligence to Foreign Countries

　　Fourth, A. Tibor Szőnyi was born in 1903. From 1930 to 1945, he acted as an American spy and returned to Hungary. During this period, he resided abroad. In 1938, he appeared in Switzerland, where during the war, he organized Hungarian exiles in Switzerland into Trotskyist groups. Shortly thereafter, he became involved with Field, one of the heads of the American intelligence organization, and then with Allen Dulles, the chief of the European division of the American intelligence organization—the Strategic Services Unit. Field was adept at maintaining connections with so-called left-wing movements. He maintained contact with exiled intelligence groups from various countries residing in Switzerland. According to Dulles's instructions, Szőnyi contacted Lombar, who is now the first counselor of the Yugoslav embassy in Bucharest. During the war, Lombar was a spy for Tito and the United States in Switzerland, and like Szőnyi, he was also doing intelligence work for Dulles for pay. Szőnyi confessed that in December 1944, Lombar gave him and his intelligence team forged documents, in which Szőnyi and his intelligence team appeared as former officers going to Yugoslavia. The Yugoslav and American intelligence organizations sent Szőnyi and his intelligence team from Switzerland to Marseille, where (half a sentence is missing—translator's note) ... military aircraft for intelligence organizations. Because the war was still continuing at that time, the American headquarters permitted the use of special military aircraft. Szőnyi stated that in Belgrade, they visited the Ministry of the Interior, where they handed

    　　　　叛国主犯拉伊克
    　　长期受德寇警察指使
    第一、甲、拉兹洛·拉伊克，一九○九年生于斯留尼亚地方（中一段电文不清，大意似为他在一九三○年以在布达佩斯散发共产主义传单被捕，后即叛变，在警察上尉拉沃斯·波科尔帮助下成为告密者，此后在大学读书时即为警察眼线及挑拨分子——译者注）；一九三二年，他向警察局告发究拉·舍埃弗林、加罗利·奥尔特和他们的同志们，一九三三年，他向警察局告发希尔基、耶诺兹尔和他们的组织。一九三四年，警察局派拉伊克到建筑业工人当中工作。那时，建筑业工人当中存在有强大的共产党组织。一九三五年，有两百人在建筑业工人罢工期间因拉伊克的出卖而遭逮捕。
    在这以后，拉伊克消声匿迹了一些时候：警察局派他到捷克斯洛伐克去刺探匈牙利共产党的国外联络关系。西班牙内战爆发后，拉伊克受秘密警察指派到了西班牙并报告匈牙利共产党的那些人参加了解放战争，同时尝试在拉科西营中发展破坏活动。拉伊克在西班牙的这种挑拨活动被注意了。调查开始了：他被禁止担任任何职位，后来即被驱逐出党。在西班牙的解放斗争失败之前，拉伊克逃到法国去，在法国的圣·西普里安，居尔，维尔奈的国际集中营中，他结识了南斯拉夫的国外谍报机关特务，如比布勒，纳基·科斯塔，哥苏雅克，马斯拉里奇，鲁拉佐维奇等人。他们同拉伊克一样曾在西班牙从事奸细谍报活动而后来在集中营内。法国和美国间谍机关和德国秘密警察都混迹在这些集中营里。美国在瑞士的间谍机关“战略服务处”的头子之一费尔德访问了拉伊克，告诉他：他奉上级的特别训令，要他帮助拉伊克返回本国。在维尔奈集中营，德国代表团也到了，代表团团长秘密警察的少校召见了拉伊克并通知他：他要派他到匈牙利去“工作”。
    拉伊克在回到匈牙利以后，他立即向那位在查拉绥时代当警察队长的政治警察头子彼特·哈因报告。拉伊克关于此点的供辞如下：“我曾把我在西班牙和法国所知道的一切告诉他。哈因告诉我德国秘密警察的警官依照他的请求而帮助我。”
    其秘密活动在匈牙利尚不为人所知的拉伊克，奉哈因的训令，把奸细海尔派到地下共产主义运动中。由于海尔的告发，共产党书记佐尔丹·舍恩赫兹被捕并被处死，罗萨被杀。为了不暴露拉伊克起见，警察也逮捕了他，但他仅被判处六个月徒刑。在一九四四年十月，查拉绥分子的军事机构把拉伊克同别人一道逮捕。一九四五年一月，他受到索普隆科奇达的军事法庭的审判。该法庭检察官雅诺英博士关于此点的证言如下：“在审判中，拉伊克为了给自己辩护，叙述他曾与警察局有长时间的接触，在许多案情中作了重要的成绩。”
    在秘密审讯时，拉伊克的哥哥、查拉绥政府的阁员安德尔·拉伊克出庭为他辩护。拉伊克被释放了，他的案子被转送到民事法庭，其后法庭在巴伐利亚便宣布了拉伊克无罪，而本案的其他四名被告则被处决。
    其后拉伊克是霍尔梯警察局和德国秘密警察的眼线和告密者，因而犯了战争罪和反人民罪。
    　　　　混入政权从事间谍活动　勾结铁托党羽反苏反人民
    乙、在一九四五年底，拉伊克回到匈牙利。他得以隐蔽他的过去，并且装扮成曾参加过西班牙之战的而且曾被迫害过的共产党人。他成为匈牙利共产党布达佩斯党组织的书记，议会议员，内政部长，以后又担任了外交部长。自然，他继续着他从前的活动。拉伊克关于此项活动的供词如下：“我经常地和有系统地使美国间谍获悉内政部和后来外交部的一切问题。”
    驻匈牙利美国谍报机关越来越重视外国谍报机关的南斯拉夫间谍铁托密使。卑鄙地利用匈牙利民主国对南斯拉夫人民所怀着的真诚的兄弟般的感情，铁托的外交代表和已渗入匈牙利的其他的官方代表在一九四五年年初，开始用最无耻的方法来建立他们自己的间谍网。
    首先，他们利用拉伊克，他以前的警察工作和间谍活动是他们所熟知的。
    拉伊克欣然把各种各样情报交给南斯拉夫军事代表团团长齐兹米尔上校、南斯拉夫公使姆拉佐维奇、南斯拉夫驻匈牙利代办布兰科夫及许多和他往来的南斯拉夫间谍。拉伊克把关于匈牙利的情况、苏军和苏联外交人员情况的秘密情报交给南斯拉夫间谍，这些情报，是他作为内政部长所掌握着的。这样，他就把关于费伦克·奈基叛国阴谋案的情报交给了南斯拉夫间谍，后者又立刻转给美国使团。他命令他的次长安德列·捷比尼博士把南斯拉夫间谍所要求的一切秘密情报供给他们。遵照着南斯拉夫谍报机关的训令，他聘请间谍捷尔斯尼斯为内政部新闻处处长，他晓得后者曾在英国谍报处工作。捷尔斯尼斯使拉伊克与在南斯拉夫使团中工作的间谍之间的联络更为方便。
    作为部长与议会议员的拉伊克，也就是作为国家的公务员，竟滥用他的公职特权，把秘密情报交给外国间谍，这就大大违背了匈牙利国家的利益，从事于间谍活动，并犯了叛国罪。
    丙、南斯拉夫间谍之受到重视，是与这一事实相关连的，即在解放了的南斯拉夫，美国的南斯拉夫间谍、奸细和托洛斯基分子，象拉伊克那样的人，获得了政权。其中约有一百五十个间谍，他们在一九四一年与拉伊克同一个时候从法国集中营被德国秘密警察的代表遣往南斯拉夫从事谍报工作。这些间谍构成了铁托的亲信的主体，并且他们有系统地把政府里诚实忠直的人排挤出去，这些人都是忠于人民的南斯拉夫爱国分子。
    被这一成功所鼓励，美帝国主义者甚至提出这样的任务，要通过铁托党羽的帮助而把人民民主国家争取到他们那一边去。关于这点，拉伊克的供词如下：“南斯拉夫内政部长兰科维奇坦率地对我说：人民民主国家必须和南斯拉夫团结，并且要以铁托为其首领。”
    为了达到这个目的，南斯拉夫、美国及其他国家的谍报机关便用多种方法来支持拉伊克。在一九四六年十一月，在拉伊克手下，又安置了佐恩尼博士，佐恩尼遵照美国谍报组织战略服务处处长艾伦·杜勒斯的训令把流亡于瑞士的匈牙利托洛斯基分子组织成间谍集团。在一九四四—四五年冬，由于在瑞士和法国的铁托代理人的帮助，杜勒斯用美国飞机把这一群间谍，假道贝尔格莱德运至匈牙利，作为南斯拉夫军事代表团混入苏军后方。在一九四六年夏，南斯拉夫代理人又给拉伊克添一个霍尔梯军队的法西斯军官巴尔费作为助手。据他自己的招认，自一九四五年夏季以来，巴尔费便被招募为南斯拉夫的间谍，假装是共产主义者；随后，他成为将军，边境卫戍军的指挥官，后来又成为国防部副部长。由于这个同谋者的帮助，拉伊克建立了密如蛛网的组织。他尽可能地把帝国主义者的代理人安置在各个高位上，首先是那些先前托洛斯基分子、奸细和间谍。这就是警察和外交部的领导地位怎样落到萨兹和费瑞吉斯少校的掌握中的情形，前者是英国情报处从南非派往匈牙利的间谍，而后者是美国“中央谍报局”谍报组织的代理人。法国第二厅的间谍马沙尔负责了警察政治教育；托洛斯基分子奥斯科和马蒂亚斯成为警察上校。拉伊克把贝克、拉特、科瓦克斯、加勒西克斯和他的其他老朋友——间谍，都安顿在政治警察局里。作为警察上校的先前的宪兵上尉科隆第受命去把先前的宪兵与霍尔梯的军官组织成内政部特别营队。
    　　　　安插走卒到国家机关里
    佐恩尼设法安插他的走卒到国家机关里、经济职位上及匈牙利共产党中，另一方面，巴尔费则使匈牙利军队中充塞着法西斯军官及霍尔梯的军官。拉伊克及其党羽有系统地排斥匈牙利警察、军队及国家机关里的信奉民主的人员，特别是工人和农民；同时，他们释放了拘禁营中的囚犯、间谍以及曾潜入那里的奸细。
    他们在政治方面也大肆活动。拉伊克的妻子曾是匈牙利民主妇女联盟总书记。他们通过拉伊克经由内政部给以广泛支持的人民大学国家委员会来对学生及青年散布他们的影响。作为“建筑业名誉工人”的拉伊克并试图通过建筑业工会来把他的影响散布到职工会里去。拉伊克又担任了匈（牙利）南（斯拉夫）协会主席等职。
    与拉伊克的组织相配合，南斯拉夫也设立它自己的间谍组织。他们利用匈牙利人民民主国家对他们的信任，不仅渗入匈牙利国家机关，并且还渗入匈牙利各政党、经济机关及人民团体。他们的组织是如此地遍布与庞大，致早在一九四七年秋季就靠着拉伊克及其党羽而采取了颠覆匈牙利人民民主国家的方针。
    前南斯拉夫驻匈代办布兰科夫关于这一点的供词如下：“我们的谍报组织逐渐伸入国家机关、军队及警察的一切部门。自一九四五年开始，我们的间谍已渗入匈牙利共产党及社会民主党的领导机构以及许多人民团体的领导机构。在匈牙利国家机关及军队里的间谍网的帮助下，南斯拉夫政府对匈牙利政府展开了广泛的破坏活动。由于这样，南斯拉夫内政部长兰科维奇就能依照铁托的计划，通过间谍网发布关于推翻匈牙利政府以及改变匈牙利国家制度的具体训令”。
    铁托一九四七年十二月的访问匈牙利，其目的即在准备这个计划的履行。在许多点上酷似征服者侵入布达佩斯的这次访问，是依照南斯拉夫政府领袖缜密拟定的计划进行的；（中半句不清）。
    　　　　与铁托密谋侵略邻国
    铁托在自布达佩斯返国途中，借口打猎，在匈南边境的凯利比亚逗留一天。在他的火车上，也搭着匈牙利内政部长拉伊克。拉伊克在搭车之前，业已与铁托及南斯拉夫政府领袖一再举行初步会谈。在凯利比亚火车站上时，南斯拉夫内政部长兰科维奇就在铁托的车上邀请拉伊克前来会晤。兰科维奇经译员布兰科夫将业已完成的工作详尽地告诉拉伊克。根据拉伊克的供词，兰科维奇说，“计划是：采取暗中麻痹邻国政府警惕心的方式，将各个人民民主国家纳入以贝尔格莱德为中心的南斯拉夫范围之内。”
    所谓巴尔干职工会联盟，巴尔干体育联盟，巴尔干青年工人联盟，巴尔干妇女联盟等等都服务于这个目的，而以贝尔格莱德为其中心。关于匈牙利的内政政策，兰科维奇给拉伊克如下指示：“要指靠军队、警察及国家机关里的沙文主义分子以及城市中特别是乡村中的小资产阶级力量。”
    兰科维奇把铁托的训令告诉拉伊克，根据该训令，拉伊克必须采取消灭匈牙利国家及共产党的真正领袖然后把匈牙利领导机关掌握在他自己手中的方针。拉伊克接受了这个任务并加紧其活动。
    自从一九四八年三月以来，有愈来愈多的事实显示南斯拉夫——美国计划已在开始被揭露出来。作为匈牙利共产党政治局委员的拉伊克，获得如此通知：情报局打算揭露铁托的叛逆。拉伊克就将这个准备工作一一通知铁托在那里的党羽。
    共产党情报局决议的发表揭露了铁托党徒的计划，而且使之不能实现；有鉴于此，铁托的追随者们便通知拉伊克，必须布置拉伊克和南斯拉夫内政部长兰科维奇一次秘密的会谈，以便就改变了的情况拟定策略。这次秘密会谈是一九四八年十月初在巴克斯城附近、地主阿那克林（霍尔梯的拥护者）的打猎场上举行的。由于边防军总司令巴尔费的帮助，兰科维奇及其两名随从非法地越过边界，并且与拉伊克相会晤，而拉伊克是南斯拉夫驻布达佩斯公使姆拉佐维奇及其夫人乔吉·塔里兹尼亚斯（巴克斯地方的教师）带到会见地点的。
    兰科维奇向拉伊克提出一个新的计划，并着重指出，该计划是铁托亲自拟就的，除了他，就只有德热拉斯和卡德尔知道这个计划。他对拉伊克说，在共产党情报局的决议之后，必须采取新的方针来达到原来的目的。他提出铁托的“辉煌”的计划，铁托将如何渐渐地把南斯拉夫人民转而反对苏联并把他们转向西方帝国主义阵营，和铁托同时打算如何加强人民民主国家内反动的力量并保证他们组织的巩固，以及铁托打算如何把这些国家拉到帝国主义方面去，使他们反苏。
    兰科维奇说，“铁托提出了在新形势下达到这个目的的三项任务。第一，动员南斯拉夫人民反对苏联；第二，增加和组织人民民主国家内的反苏力量；第三，利用苏联与英美之间在国际问题上的分歧。在后一问题上，我们必须在对苏联的殖民政策的斗争中依赖大国的支持。……铁托以制订一种计划辉煌地解决了这个问题，按照这个计划，就可能逐渐地消灭南斯拉夫人民的亲苏情绪”。
    在指出这个计划的主要内容时，拉伊克供称：“这个辉煌计划的主要原则，正如兰科维奇告诉我的，是：首先进行批评共产党情报局的决议，然后把这个决议形容为只是诽谤，（中缺一小段）。相反地，在这期间将声言对苏友好……。他继称：然后，我们将渐渐地，可是更坚决地开始说，南斯拉夫五年计划以及社会主义建设计划之不可能实现，特别是我们对提高群众生活水平所作诺言之不可能实现，应由苏联负责。……兰科维奇说，这种宣传无疑地将很有效。有了它的帮助，我国人民对苏联友好的情绪将转而变为憎恨……兰科维奇说，按照铁托的打算，这种宣传定将给在群众面前提出铁托的倾向西方国家而不倾向苏联之借口铺平道路。”
    　　　　阴谋刺杀匈国人民领袖　妄图武装推翻人民政权
    至于匈牙利，兰科维奇告拉伊克称，铁托“在最近将来将开始一个激烈的运动反对匈牙利政府及其国家领袖。拉科西将被控犯修正主义和在他的领导下，匈牙利政府想分割住有匈牙利居民的南斯拉夫领土。当因此南斯拉夫与匈牙利的人民之间发生分歧时，在适当的时机，这个问题将在议会提出。这一行动将伴以边境事件，南斯拉夫将把事件的责任归咎匈牙利”。
    根据兰科维奇提出的计划，这些边境事件将作为南斯拉夫对匈牙利实行军事干涉和武装占领部分匈牙利领土的正式借口。这一干涉将在苏联忙于某些国际复杂问题的时候发生。这一军事行动的一部分将是着匈牙利军服的南斯拉夫军队越过边境，以及集结在英美占领区的宪兵、查拉绥分子与霍尔梯分子也穿着匈牙利军服自南斯拉夫开入匈牙利。
    这个计划包括对某些匈牙利政府委员的“肉体消灭”，首先是拉科西、法卡斯和格罗。拉伊克惊慌了，说他们在这方面很有经验，兰科维奇稳定了他，说：“某些铁托的敌人能够很好地讲出铁托和他（兰科维奇）用以祛除其敌人的手段”。
    兰科维奇向拉伊克建议把刺杀匈牙利政府各首要部长的任务分配给军队中的巴尔费和希亚曼。
    兰科维奇说：“要注意，这些刺杀要是变化多端的，譬如：这个人××，另一个人自杀，××××突然因病死亡，而后作适当的解释，例如企图逃跑等”。（这一段收抄不清）在结语时，兰科维奇说到铁托的训令和条件：“南斯拉夫的援助使新匈牙利政府对南斯拉夫不得不负有无需讨论的自然的义务。在我和安东·罗勃的管辖下内外政策问题以及匈军问题——一切都必须与南斯拉夫的利益相协调。其次匈牙利的工业必须作若干牺牲以完成南斯拉夫的经济计划。”
    兰科维奇陈述了他的关于新政府的计划。拉伊克将任新政府的总理，安东·罗勃（南斯拉夫在匈牙利的谍报机关“尤巴”的首脑之一）任内政部长，南斯拉夫的间谍乔吉·巴尔菲任国防部长。兰科维奇继称：“假若逃往西方的社会民主党领袖和费伦克·奈基的几个亲信参加将来的政府，铁托不会反对”。政治训令中的一部分并要求拉伊克依靠霍尔梯与查拉绥的拥护者，天主教反动派和富农，而且他就此强调南斯拉夫的例子，“在那里，铁托并未进行反富农的斗争”。最后，兰科维奇并称他愿将他自己的用于武装推翻政府的军事专家们交给拉伊克支配。
    拉伊克接受了铁托的执行训令。在一到达布达佩斯时，他便训令乔吉·巴尔费在军队中进行各项推翻共和国的武装准备。经由他自己的线索已经获知兰科维奇所提出之计划的巴尔费，让拉伊克知道他已经开始准备并已熟悉了武装行动计划的细节。
    拉伊克也训令佐恩尼进行准备工作——准备一个以使匈牙利工人阶级的领导权转入拉伊克之手为目的的会议。另一方面，兰科维奇则派两名政治刺客老手——两名刽子手，伊姆凡诺维奇和尤伊基奇到匈牙利去当外交官。他给他们以准备刺杀拉科西总理的使命。
    这一切计划都由于政府采取了镇压反动分子和间谍的措施而被粉碎了。结果，相当多的拉伊克的支持者被解除了他们在军队、警察和政府机关中的职务。五月中旬，开始了逮捕阴谋叛国者。
    上述事实表明拉伊克充当了一个旨在武力推翻以一九四六年第一号法律确立的民主国家以及共和国政府的组织的创始人，并且因领导这个组织而构成了罪状。
    　　　　巴尔费
    　　筹划武装推翻本国政府供给铁托集团军事情报
    第二、甲，乔吉·巴尔费，一九○九年生于一个富有的资产阶级的家庭。第二次世界大战前，一经自鲁多威克学院毕业后，即在意大利法西斯军队中服役一年。返国后，就是一个顽固的法西斯分子。他在霍尔梯的军队中充当军官，曾参加占领乌克兰，并因此获得国防部的奖状。由于他的妻子的祖籍的原故，他被迫辞去军职，这就成为后来他在一九四五年初参加新军充当“反德”军官的借口。一九四五年夏，他已经是南斯拉夫情报机关的间谍。同年，与拉伊克建立了关系。巴尔费在与拉伊克数度商谈当中，了解了并且同意那个旨在反对国家与人民的组织的目的。巴尔费的任务包括这个组织的军事领导。他在拉伊克的同意下，在军队中庇护霍尔梯系的法西斯军官，并提升他们的职位，并且委派那些他知道是盲目服从他的卑劣目的与训令的人们，担任重要的领导职务。一九四七年，巴尔费奉拉伊克之命，加紧活动，他组织了与准备武装阴谋等等有关的检阅和演习。
    借助于南斯拉夫驻布达佩斯的武官洛齐奇上校，巴尔费和南斯拉夫的涅捷尔科维奇上校建立了关系。他们一九四七年十一月于罗马在游击队代表大会相晤，涅捷尔科维奇向巴尔费传达了铁托的直接训令。他向巴尔费保证：铁托的目的，由于受到美国的支持，将会实现。
    一九四八年十月，在拉伊克与南斯拉夫内政部长兰科维奇在巴克斯举行秘密会谈后，巴尔费加紧了为着推翻共和国的武装准备工作。他在纸面准备和拟定了一个他认为有十个营就可以实行的计划。巴尔费指派这些营去夺取最重要的公共建筑物、邮局、电台、党的中央委员会以及各省的工业中心。巴尔费订出暗杀政府委员拉科西、法卡斯及格罗的计划。他把这一任务分配给前宪兵队长、警察上校科隆第，打算在科隆第已经组织好的特别营外，再将霍尔梯军官组成的特别队拨给他指挥。这一计划上在大布达佩斯的地图上，藏在巴尔费的办公室保险箱中，直到他获悉他的同谋者被捕时为止。在他的秘书罗森费利的协助下，巴尔费把计划毁掉了。
    这样，巴尔费因进行旨在武力推翻依据一九四六年第一号法律确立的民主国家与共和国的组织工作，而犯了罪。
    乙、自一九四五年以来，巴尔费就是南斯拉夫谍报处的代理人。他曾定期的将关于军队的秘密文件和情报送给南斯拉夫在匈牙利的谍报组织的头子和南斯拉夫公使馆的参事拉萨尔·布兰科夫。他向军政部的雇员颁发训令，要他们供给布兰科夫所要求的情报。巴尔费为南斯拉夫的武官洛齐奇上校进行了此项谍报活动，并在洛齐奇离开后为南斯拉夫公使馆参事若凯尔上校进行此项谍报活动。
    巴尔费身为中将与督察，滥用其官职地位，将匈牙利国家关于军事与经济情况的秘密情报送给外国的代表们。因此他犯了违背国家利益的大罪。
    　　　　布兰科夫
    　　是铁托集团驻匈官方间谍头目
    第三，甲、拉萨尔·布兰科夫是南斯拉夫内政部长兰科维奇在匈牙利主要代理人。起初他是南斯拉夫军事使团团长，后为南斯拉夫公使馆的参事，继而成为南斯拉夫的代办。正如布兰科夫所供认的，在被派到匈牙利以前，当一九四五年初，南斯拉夫军事使团团长奥勃齐兹麦德上校于提及铁托的命令时曾提出使团团员的任务如下：“铁托、卡德尔与兰科维奇期望使团团员们将利用他们留在匈牙利的机会来搜集关于匈牙利政府的政治与经济措施的谍报材料，并对苏驻匈军队进行谍报工作。他告诉我们，说我们必须与英美代表建立紧密的联系，不要落在盟国管制委员会苏联方面特别是伏罗希洛夫元帅的势力之下”。
    布兰科夫为遵照这一点，而与拉伊克、巴尔费及其他反对匈牙利民主国家的分子们保持联系达数年。他使巴尔费与拉伊克取得了联系。他协调了拉伊克、巴尔费及其他等人的组织的活动。他指导了安东·罗勃的谍报活动，在他的要求下，罗勃被选为匈牙利境内南部斯拉夫人民主联盟的书记并成为议会的议员。在拉伊克与兰科维奇一九四七年十二月于凯利比亚举行谈判时，布兰科夫充当翻译员。作为铁托与兰科维奇的可靠代理人，他被给予加紧履行旨在推翻匈牙利共和国计划与控制此事的任务。当共产党情报局决议发表后布兰科夫在扮演这一角色中遭遇困难时，他奉兰科维奇的直接训令声言反对铁托，且在发表关于此问题的公开声明后，他留在匈牙利，拒绝返回南斯拉夫。但实际上他秘密地继续进行其旨在推翻匈牙利共和国的活动。这样，布兰科夫因指导旨在武力推翻依照一九四六年第一号法律确立的民主国家与民主共和国政府的组织工作而犯了罪。
    乙、布兰科夫是南斯拉夫在匈牙利的官方谍报组织的头目。他四年多来曾经常从拉伊克、巴尔费及其他若干招募来的代理人获得秘密情报。他直接从铁托那里接到关于进行这种活动的训令。他是铁托最活跃的代理人。
    布兰科夫在逗留匈牙利期间内始终从事谍报工作。
    丙、在一九××年夏，布兰科夫曾召见南斯拉夫谍报组织之一员、南斯拉夫驻布达佩斯使团的新闻参赞博罗夫，并通知他说：匈境南斯拉夫人领袖之一米洛施·莫伊奇已声言支持共产党情报局的决议，因此，恐怕他会揭露铁托在匈牙利的支持者的活动。布兰科夫训令博罗夫去劝说莫伊奇放弃这个心意，假如莫伊奇坚持他的立场，便杀死他。随后，布兰科夫便把南斯拉夫公使姆拉佐维奇的手枪拿给博罗夫，博罗夫便于一九四八年六月十日晚在莫伊奇的房间里连放好几枪，打死了莫伊奇。
    这样，布兰科夫劝说博罗夫去杀死莫伊奇，就犯了谋杀教唆罪。
    　　　　佐恩尼
    　　勾结美国间谍供给外国情报
    第四、甲、提波尔·佐恩尼生于一九○三年。从一九三○年到一九四五年他充当美国间谍回到匈牙利，这一段时间内，他全居留在国外。一九三八年，他在瑞士出现，在战争期间，他就在那儿把瑞士境内的匈牙利流亡者组织成托洛斯基集团。此后不久，他便与美国谍报组织的头子之一费尔德勾搭上了，并且跟着又与艾伦·杜勒斯相勾搭，后者是美国谍持报组织—战略服务处欧洲分处的处长。费尔德是与所谓左翼运动保联系的能手。他与居留在瑞士的各国流亡谍报团体保持联系。按照杜勒斯的指令，佐恩尼与现任南斯拉夫驻布加勒斯特公使馆一等参事隆巴尔取得联系，在战争期间，隆巴尔是铁托与美国在瑞士的间谍，和佐恩尼一样，他也是为求报酬而替杜勒斯干谍报工作的。佐恩尼供称：在一九四四年十二月，隆巴尔以伪造的文件交给他及其谍报组人员，在这些伪造文件里，佐恩尼及其谍报组人员是以前赴南斯拉夫的军官的面目而出现的。南斯拉夫和美国的谍报组织把佐恩尼及其谍报组从瑞士派往马赛，在那儿（中掉半句——译注）……军用机供谍报组织使用。因为那时战争仍然继续着，美国总部便准许利用军用专机。佐恩尼称：在贝尔格莱德他们曾访问内政部，在那里将他们的文件交给了柯瓦斯维奇少校。少校将他们指引到在奥兹纳的政治警察局，在那里他们过了好几天，接受指示，然后以南斯拉夫军事使团的资格以适当的护送下经由诺维沙德与苏波提加到士额特。在士额特，佐恩尼一行奉奥兹纳的军官卡拉法提奇少校指示毁了他们南斯拉夫的文件。
    后来，佐恩尼及其一群间谍，占据了颇有影响的地位。佐恩尼本人成为共产党人事部部长，这使他能够给与同来的美国间谍及拉伊克派给他的人以适当的职位。佐恩尼及那些由他帮助而取得职位的间谍们将关于国内政治与经济情势的秘密情报，一部分直接交给在贝尔格莱德与他们联系的人，另一部分经由他们的信差交到瑞士给美国谍报机关。一九四七年二月佐恩尼奉特别训令，要为美国间谍比拉·萨兹，乔治·阿丹姆，与伊凡·梅特取得重要的行政位置。一九四六年秋天，佐恩尼奉艾伦·杜勒斯之命受拉伊克领导，而佐恩尼的谍报人员也由拉伊克支配。
    佐恩尼，他那时是议会议员，滥用他的官职，并将有关匈牙利国家的国际和经济情势的秘密情报交给外国的代表，而从事间谍行动，即是犯了叛国罪。
    乙、佐恩尼给他的于一九四五年一月返回祖国的谍报人员委以各种最重要的国家行政和经济的职位。例如他设法将费伦奇·瓦基安插到总理办公厅新闻处，将伊斯特万·弗尔迪安插到匈苏石油公司，后来又安插到工业部，将彼德·巴拉班安插到无线电台编辑部，将乔吉·霍多斯安插到计划处，将安德拉斯·卡尔曼博士安插到社会福利部，将久拉·库提博士安插到医药工作者工会。直到一九四七年二月，佐恩尼每两月定期与其谍报人员开会一次。但在一九四七年二月以后，由于谋叛的考虑，他只在没有别人看见时才与他们会谈。在会议上他训令其谍报组织里的人员吸收新人——人民民主的敌人到谍报组织来。佐恩尼定期向拉伊克呈报他所招募的间谍在何地工作，同时将他的组织听任拉伊克指挥。拉伊克这一方面则按时把他的目的和铁托与兰科维奇给他的训令告诉佐恩尼。一九四九年春，佐恩尼曾屡次与拉伊克会商推翻共和国和武力夺取政权的问题。
    这样，佐恩尼就犯了指导旨在推翻一九四六年第一号法律所确立的匈牙利人民共和国国家与政府的组织罪。
    　　　　萨莱
    　　是南国谍报组织代理人
    第五、甲、安得拉斯·萨莱，生于一九一八年。在一九三五年成为警察谍报人员。从那时以后他就作为奸细进行活动，时而在南斯拉夫，时而在匈牙利。作为一个警察谍报人员，他在一九四二年把下列共产主义青年团的领导机关人员出卖给了警探安塔尔·尤萨兹，恩德尔·萨尔瓦里，拉兹洛·奥尔班，埃瓦·拉赫斯及彼得·艾克德斯。为了避免把他暴露出来，他曾被判处轻刑，于一九四四年在萨托拉辽叶利的监狱里服刑，而在该狱中他继续为警察工作。当时，该监狱中的南斯拉夫和匈牙利政治犯正在挖一条秘密通道。萨莱把这条通道和越狱计划的一切细节都告诉了监狱长林德布格。由于这一出卖的结果，监狱长获悉了越狱计划。因此，监狱长采取了对策。有六十四个犯人被杀或随后被处死了。为了酬劳他的情报，萨莱就被释放了。
    这样，萨莱就因为是杀害或非法处死六十四名政治犯的共谋犯而犯了战争罪。
    乙、萨莱长时以来就在匈牙利为南斯拉夫的谍报组织进行间谍活动。根据布兰科夫的供辞：“萨莱毕生与兰科维奇和尤巴保有联系。尤巴把他掌握在手中，因为它知道他在萨托拉辽叶利监狱中的出卖行为”。
    最初萨莱奉南斯拉夫的斯米拉尼奇少校的训令进行间谍活动。斯米拉尼奇少校是南斯拉夫赔偿管理局局长，在匈牙利工作。后来他隶从公使馆参事布兰科夫，以后又隶从塞迪亚尼奇。在从事谍报活动期间，他奉布兰科夫的训令得到边境防御准备工作的草案和这一草案的注释。他呈报了关于部长会议秘密决定及其他问题的秘密情报。萨莱并与南斯拉夫间谍罗勃保有联系，甚至在工厂国有化法在报上发表前就把该法的准备情况出卖给了罗勃。萨莱就这样把有关匈牙利国家经济与军事情况的秘密情报交给外国人，从而严重地损害了国家的利益。这就是说他犯了间谍罪和叛国罪。
    丙、作为南斯拉夫谍报组织的代理人，萨莱任命谍报组织所指派的人担任国家机构中的重要职位。按照南斯拉夫谍报组织所发出的训令，他团结这些人并指导他们工作。萨莱就这样任命列克兹到外交部供职，并奉布兰科夫的训令使列克兹留在外交部中，尽管他有为南斯拉夫从事谍报活动的很大的嫌疑。用同样的方法他使南斯拉夫间谍、前警察上尉赫格杜斯混入赔偿管理局。萨莱成功地让南斯拉夫谍报机关在匈牙利的代理人罗勃被提名为候选人。在一九四八年九月，奉罗勃训令，他把南斯拉夫间谍米伦科派到党校中。他经常地指导这些间谍。
    萨莱就这样成了以推翻依据一九四六年第一号法律确立的民主国家制度为目的而从事组织活动的领袖之一。
    　　　　奥格涅诺维区
    　　充当铁托集团间谍
    第六，匈牙利公民米兰·奥格涅诺维区自一九四六年即被招募充当南斯拉夫谍报组织头子罗勃的间谍。奉罗勃的训令，他与南斯拉夫谍报组织的另一间谍——南斯拉夫驻布达佩斯公使馆秘书布拉齐区建立联系。奉布拉齐区的训令，奥格涅诺维区签署誓书，保证他将作为南斯拉夫的间谍而工作。奉布拉齐区的训令，他以南斯拉夫代理人的资格招募了科瓦西维区、克拉提科夫、格罗米区和苏普特。通过他们，他收到国内政治和其他性质的秘密情报。他把这些情报综合在其每月报告中，送交南斯拉夫谍报组织。谍报组织便对这些情报按期给他以金钱的报酬。奥格涅诺维区在其活动中所犯罪行为间谍和叛国罪。
    　　　　科隆第
    　　组织法西斯残余阴谋武装推翻政府
    第七，比拉·科隆第，生于一九一四年。在霍尔梯法西斯统治时期，曾服务于宪兵，官阶上尉。科隆第由苏联军队逃到德国，在德国又因巴尔费的特别邀请而返国。巴尔费曾为其证明身份并派他到民主军担任少校。其后巴尔费为希望巩固拉伊克的谍报组织，乃把科隆第交给内政部长，拉伊克任命他为警察上校。拉伊克命令科隆第在前霍尔梯宪兵军官，士官和其他法西斯残余分子中进行组织，拉伊克可以绝对依靠且可以随意支配作反共和国行动的营队。在拉伊克告知他问题是反政府的武装谋叛之后，科隆第由巴尔费接到了关于履行谋叛计划的指示。一九四八年七月，据科隆第供称，巴尔费曾告诉他：“他知道拉伊克给我的指示。他说：我必须为夺取布达佩斯重要目标进行布置。他继而声称：我可以依靠由他所组织的、并由可靠的霍尔梯军官所组成的特务团。巴尔费称：我必须调查政府委员拉科西、法卡斯和格罗三人在那里并且去捕逮他们。他宣称：如遇任何抵抗，我必须凭借武力。”
    到谈话结束时，巴尔费告诉科隆第：武力撤换政府必将获得成功，因为他会得到南斯拉夫武装部队讨伐团的支持。这样，科隆第因领导以武力推翻按照一九四六年第一号法律所确立民主共和国的民主国家制度和政府为目的之组织活动而犯了罪。
    　　　　尤斯图斯
    　　出卖匈国各党情报供给南国谍报机关
    第八、保罗·尤斯图斯，生于一九○五年。从一九三二年起，他就担任匈牙利政治警察的谍报员。由于知道尤斯图斯担任政治谍报员的职务，南斯拉夫驻布达佩斯军事代表团团长兹齐米尔上校和公使馆人员雅伏尔斯基少校，便把尤斯图斯安插在南斯拉夫谍报组织中工作。作为议会议员、社会民主党领导机关的人员和匈牙利广播管理处主任，尤斯图斯搜集秘密情报并把它转送给南斯拉夫谍报机关。尤斯图斯是老托洛斯基分子，并与许多国际托洛斯基分子保持个人接触，他把秘密情报、主要是关于社会民主党、共产党和以后的匈牙利劳动人民党的事务的秘密情报交给南斯拉夫谍报机关。他以文字和口头方式把这些材料传给南斯拉夫间谍。
    铁托党羽把尤斯图斯的间谍活动看得如此重要，以致于最近已禁止在南斯拉夫驻布达佩斯公使馆工作的间谍与他保持接触。来自尤斯图斯的情报经常由兰科维奇所特别指定的代表收受。尤斯图斯除了为南斯拉夫利益而从事谍报活动之外，并为法国驻布达佩斯公使馆文化参赞。兰克·茄旭从事谍报活动。尤斯图斯把他为南斯拉夫所搜集的相当大一部分的谍报材料，送交给茄旭。他向他提出在社会民主党领导机关会议上及后来在匈牙利工人党领导机关会议上所获得的特别详尽的秘密情况，以及关于匈牙利无线电台的组织、行政和技术问题的秘密材料。
    保罗·尤斯图斯身为国民议会议员及广播管理处主任，以关于匈牙利国家的国际与经济地位的秘密情报送交外国代表。他这种行为严重地损害了国家的利益。因此，尤斯图斯犯了间谍罪与叛国罪。
    　　　　罪状的定义
    　　拉伊克及其同谋犯建立叛国团体，企图使匈牙利变为美帝和铁托叛徒集
    　　团的殖民地。
    罪状的定义。拉伊克及其同谋犯建立以推翻被宪法所保证的匈牙利人民民主、消灭匈牙利独立、及使国家受外国人奴役为目的的团体。拉伊克及其匪党规定其自身任务为：使匈牙利与唯一保证我国人民自由及幸福的和平阵营分离，并把我国束缚于帝国主义阵线，从而把匈牙利降到帝国主义傀儡——卫星国的屈辱地位。他们曾企图依靠南斯拉夫国家的首脑铁托、兰科维奇、卡德尔和德热拉斯的武力支持来达到这一目的。拉伊克及其匪帮亟欲毁坏匈牙利人民民主的一切伟大成就，把分配给农民的土地交还给地主，把矿山和工厂交还给资本家，束缚起匈牙利劳动人民的双手，并使那些已经逃到西方的匈牙利人民的敌人重行执政。谋叛者亟欲把匈牙利变成南斯拉夫的殖民地，变成铁托——他已与其匪党一同背弃社会主义和民主阵营而投入外国资本家和反动派的阵营、因而把南斯拉夫变成帝国主义的奴仆——的殖民地。在拉伊克及其同谋的计划后面站着美国帝国主义，美帝国主义在其德奥占领区内业已集结了其走狗——前查拉绥法西斯分子和霍尔梯军官、以前的宪兵，他们希望如同一九四四年一样，再一次把匈牙利人民投入血泊中，并再一次（这一次不是为德国法西斯的利益而是为美国帝国主义的利益）出卖匈牙利人民并从而摧毁我们解放与复兴的一切成就。
    拉伊克及其同谋犯曾不惮凭借任何卑劣手段以逞其罪恶的阴谋。罪状为被告的供认，附于将在审讯时宣布之文件上的材料以及笔录所证明。一切罪状已由证人的证言所证实，我根据对各该证人的诘问，在起诉书中提出建议。没有任何材料足以说明被告在犯罪时系处于不能负责的状态，也没有任何理由足以排除审讯和惩处被告的可能性。因此，所提出对他们的起诉是具有法律的力量的。
