Cannonball King Zhen Rongdian

“I am able to attend such a grand conference, unprecedented in history. This proves that the status of the Chinese working class has changed. We were once treated like beasts of burden, but now we are masters. What was once an unimaginable dream has become a reality today. But thinking about it, if there were no Communist Party, would we have this day? Of course not.” Zhen Rongdian, the comrade who earned the glorious title of "Cannonball King" for his astonishing record of turning out a small cannonball outer circle in seventy-five seconds, excitedly shared his thoughts when attending the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.

Comrade Zhen Rongdian possesses the noble qualities of a Communist Party member. Since 1940, when he was an apprentice at the Huangyandong Ordnance Factory of the Military Industry Department in the Taihang Mountains, he has been engaged in the most arduous and heavy work, the turning of cannonball outer circles, which did not allow for the learning of new skills. This was a job that others considered physically exhausting and without progress, and they wanted to switch jobs after three months. But Zhen Rongdian said, "As long as it benefits the front lines, I will keep doing it." He persisted for five years, creating new records time and again, eventually creating a record of producing four hundred and eighty small cannonballs in one day (ten hours), powerfully supporting the front lines of the war. This enabled him to transform from an apprentice into a model labor hero in a short span of two years, causing a sensation throughout the entire border region.

During the cruel days of the anti-"mopping-up" campaigns in the Taihang area during the War of Resistance, each destructive mopping-up operation by the enemy targeted the Military Industry Department as its primary objective. Several times, with overwhelming superior forces, they penetrated the remote mountains, attempting to destroy the Eighth Route Army's military industry.

Under the slogan of "Not losing a single machine, not losing a single worker," Zhen Rongdian always stood at the forefront, often going alone to places three to five miles away from the factory to choose good places to bury the machines, devising various ingenious methods of camouflage. After burying the machines and carefully memorizing the nearby landmarks, he immediately picked up the "6.5" rifle that he had not left for five years and became a heroic worker self-defense team member. Together with other self-defense team members, he protected all the workers, cleverly breaking through the enemy's encirclement several times. During the major "mopping-up" operation in May 1942, the enemy encircled the entire Taihang Mountains, searching like a net from the mountaintops to the foot of the mountains. The enemy excavation teams, searching for machines, dug up the ground into a mess. At that time, all the workers in the factory, under the orders of the factory director, moved to distant places, but Zhen Rongdian couldn't bear to leave and secretly stayed within the encirclement with a few self-defense team members, playing "hide-and-seek" with the enemy. Whenever the excavation teams approached the location of the machines, they would shoot at the enemy, attracting them to the mountains, protecting the revolutionary property with their lives. In his five years behind enemy lines, he never lost a single tool.

"Wherever Zhen Rongdian goes, the work there gets done exceptionally well." "With Zhen Rongdian, the task is guaranteed." These became well-known sayings in the Military Industry Department. On the eve of the great counter-offensive in 1945, the Military Industry Department established a new "82" cannonball factory. After more than twenty days of operation, no goods were being produced. Zhen Rongdian was transferred there. He not only took the lead in doing the work himself, but also united the veteran workers, other workers, and apprentices to work together. As a result, production volume increased step by step along with his records. Zhen Rongdian increased production from forty-five "82" large cannonballs a day to eighty, and other workers also increased to fifty a day.

The great counter-offensive began, and the front lines needed several times more cannonballs. How could they complete the task? Zhen Rongdian suggested, "Such a big task cannot be accomplished just by holding meetings at the top. We must take the mass line and mobilize everyone to discuss it. Workers always think that the tasks given by the superiors are the superiors' business. If the plan is set by themselves, and they have spoken it out, they will feel responsible if they don't complete it, and they will have to think of a way no matter how busy they are." In this way, the workers launched a production surge competition, and Zhen Rongdian created a record of one hundred, with other workers also increasing their output to sixty, completing the September task. With frequent reports of victories in the counter-offensive, Zhen Rongdian issued a challenge at the workers' congress, saying, "I not only guarantee to supply the shell casings to all departments, but also guarantee that they won't run out." He took advantage of spare time to rush production and came up with ways to transform the tools to reduce a procedure. As a result, he created the astonishing speed of producing one hundred and thirty-five shells in ten hours a day, exceeding the original output by seven times. The first beautiful battles that completely annihilated Chiang Kai-shek's invading army on the Handan and Shangdang front lines were launched at this time.

In the war, the working class, with a spirit of self-sacrifice, went through fire and water to support the front lines, guaranteeing victory. This is the glory of the Chinese working class. Comrade Zhen Rongdian is one of the outstanding labor heroes cultivated by the Chinese Communist Party in the long war. He is now an executive member of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and a standing committee member of the trade union of the North China Ordnance Bureau. He has represented Chinese young workers at a conference in Poland and is now representing North China workers at the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. He humbly said, "But I am too ashamed. I didn't have the opportunity to study culture in the old society when I was oppressed and exploited. In the past ten years of war, apart from burying myself in hard work, I haven't learned well. Everyone supports me to be a representative, and I am afraid of letting everyone down. In order to do a better job in the future, I must work hard to improve my political, cultural, and technical skills, and work with everyone to build China into an industrialized country."

　　炮弹大王甄荣典
    “我能出席这样一个历史上没有过的大会，这就是证明中国工人阶级的地位变了，过去是牛马，现在是主人了，作梦也想不到的事，今天变成了事实。可是想一想：假如没有共产党是不是能够有今天呢，当然是不能的。”以七十五秒钟旋一发小炮弹外圆的惊人纪录，获得“炮弹大王”光荣称号的甄荣典同志在参加中国人民政协时，兴奋愉快地谈着他的感想。
    甄荣典同志有着共产党员高尚的品质，由一九四○年在太行山的军工部黄烟洞兵工厂当学徒时候起，一直干着最苦重，又学不到技术的旋车炮弹外圆工作，这是旁人都认为身体吃不消，没进步，干上三个月就要调换的工作，可是甄荣典却说：“只要对前线有利，我就干下去。”这样他坚持了五年，而且一次又一次的创造新纪录，最后创造了一天（十小时）出四百八十发小炮弹的纪录，有力地支援前线战争，使他在短短两年中从一个学徒变成了轰动全边区的特等劳动英雄。
    正当抗战时太行区反“扫荡”战争残酷的日子里，敌人每一次毁灭性的清剿都以军工部为其主要目标，曾几次的以压倒的优势兵力，打进人迹罕见的大山里，企图摧毁当时八路军的军工工业。
    在“不丢掉一件机器，不损失一个工人，”的口号下，甄荣典始终站在最前面，常常一个人走到距工厂三、五里以外的地方选择埋藏机器的好地方，想出种种伪装的巧妙办法。当埋好了机器，细心牢记住附近的目标以后，他立刻拿起来五年未离开过的那支“六五”步枪，变成英勇的工人自卫队员，和其他少数的自卫队员保卫着全体工人，曾几次机智的冲出敌人重重包围。一九四二年五月的大“扫荡”，敌人整整把太行山围上一个圈，由山顶到山脚象撒网般的搜，寻找机器的敌人挖掘队把地皮挖了个稀烂，那时全厂工人都奉厂长命令向远处转移，但甄荣典舍不得离开，偷偷地和几个自卫队员留在清剿圈里和敌人“捉迷藏”，每当挖掘队走到机器的位置，他们就向敌人射击，将敌人吸引到山上，用生命保护住革命的财产，他在敌后五年来没有遗失过一件工具。
    “甄荣典走到那里，那里工作就搞的呱呱叫。”“有了甄荣典，任务就有保证。”成了军工部流传的佳话。一九四五年大反攻前夕，军工部成立了一座新的“八二”炮弹厂，开工二十多天，始终不出货，甄荣典被调去了，他不仅自己带头去做，又团结老师父，团结其他工人，团结学徒，一起去干，于是生产量也随着他的纪录步步提高，甄荣典由一天出四十五个“八二”大炮弹，增到八十个，旁的工人也增到一天出五十个。
    大反攻开始了，前线需要炮弹增加好几倍，如何完成任务呢？甄荣典就提意见：“这样大的任务，光靠上面开会不行。必须走群众路线，发动大伙讨论。工人们总认为上面给的任务是上级的事，要是自己订的计划，经自己嘴里说出，完不成就觉得是自己的责任，怎忙也要想出个办法。”就这样，工人展开生产突击竞赛，甄荣典创造一百个的纪录，旁的工人产量也增到六十个，完成了九月份的任务。反攻捷报频传，甄荣典在职工大会上提出挑战说：“我不但保证供上各部的弹壳，而且保证用不完。”他利用空隙时间赶工，又想法改造工具减少一道手续，于是又创造了每天十小时出一百三十五个的惊人速度，超过原来产量七倍。在邯郸前线和上党前线，全歼蒋介石进犯军的第一次漂亮仗就在这时打响了。
    在战争中，工人阶级用自我牺牲的精神，出生入死支援前线，保证了胜利，这是中国工人阶级的光荣，甄荣典同志正是中国共产党在长期战争中培养出来的出色的劳动英雄之一。他现在是中华全国总工会的执行委员，华北兵工局的工会常委，曾代表中国青年工人到波兰开过大会，这次又代表华北工人出席中国人民政治协商会议。他谦虚地说：“可是我太惭愧，自己在旧社会受压迫剥削没有学习文化的机会，十来年的战争中，除了埋头苦干外，学习得也不好，大家拥护咱做代表，自己觉得怕辜负了大家的意思。为了今后把工作作得更好，我一定要努力提高政治、文化、技术，来和大家一道，把中国建设成一个工业国。”
