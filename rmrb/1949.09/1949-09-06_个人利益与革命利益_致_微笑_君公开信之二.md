Individual Interests and Revolutionary Interests
—Open Letter No. 2 to "Smile"
    Dong Qian

As for what you said, when in the revolutionary ranks, seeing that the supply system cannot solve "all personal and family difficulties," you "couldn't help but shed a few tears of sadness"?! At first hearing, it seems this shows you possess the "virtue" of "being concerned about what others worry about," but this "virtue" is precisely what constitutes your moral view that "revolution is cruel." So, is this moral view revolutionary and materialistic, or degenerate and idealistic? Here, its boundary must be clearly defined to further distinguish right from wrong.

Yes, as a revolutionary, one should possess all the greatest and noblest virtues, but these virtues are built upon the scientific basis of dialectical materialism and established on the material foundation of the proletarian liberation and the struggle for human liberation; not built on the degenerate foundation of protecting individual and the interests of a few exploiters. That is to say, revolutionary morality is a scientific, class-based product, not a super-class, independent, abstract humanitarianism. Comrade Liu Shaoqi, one of the leaders of our Party, in his article "On the Self-Cultivation of Communists," clearly and firmly declared to us: "We do not recognize the so-called greater, more scientific, super-class, general morality in class society. This is just deceptive nonsense, and in fact, it is only the so-called 'morality' built on the basis of safeguarding the interests of a few exploiters. This kind of 'moral' view has always been idealistic."

The issue is now very clear. Although you once "shed a few tears of sadness," because it was not, or not entirely, from the long-term interests of the people, it precisely exposed your petty-bourgeois humanitarianism and sympathy.

Because "the Communist Party not only represents the interests of individual Party members, but also represents the long-term interests of all workers and the liberation of mankind... Therefore, do not regard the Communist Party as merely a narrow, guild-like small group that seeks the private interests of Party members." ("On the Self-Cultivation of Communists")

Why has the Communist Party been fighting arduously for twenty-eight years, and why does it implement the true meaning of the supply system of providing the lowest living standard? It is precisely to alleviate the burdens and sufferings of the people, to share weal and woe with the people, and to spend these difficult days together. Those who participate in the revolution do so voluntarily and consciously sacrifice individual interests and absolutely obey revolutionary interests. This is fundamentally different from the counter-revolutionary Kuomintang, which only seeks personal promotion and wealth, indulges in pleasure, and disregards the lives and deaths of the people. However, you must recognize such a truth: Even though you can "earn" a lot of money and "support" your parents, wife, and children in the Kuomintang, how many people are like that? Where does the money they earn come from? Isn't it all squeezed from the blood and sweat of the common people? Thus, although a few high-ranking officials and dignitaries can be well-fed and carefree, the broad masses of working people suffer, unable to get enough to eat despite working all year round. In this case, can we say that revolution is "cruel" and counter-revolution is "benevolent"? Do you know how many lives of the people have been trampled under this cloak of "benevolence"!

In order to prove the correctness of the argument that "selfishness cannot be eradicated," you denied the noblest virtues of revolutionaries, you denied that revolutionaries are the most conscious vanguard fighters of the proletariat, and you denied that "only the working class is the most far-sighted, selfless, and most thoroughly revolutionary" ("On the People's Democratic Dictatorship") this characteristic, and reduced them to the level of ordinary people, which is completely wrong.

World revolutionary teacher Stalin said in the oath he read on behalf of the entire Party at the Second Soviet Congress: "We Communists are people with special characters, we are made of special materials. The army of the great proletarian strategist, the army of Comrade Lenin, is composed of people like us." ("History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)", Chapter Seven, Section Four)

But this does not mean that a revolutionary has no personal interests at all because he is "made of special materials." Rather, it means that they are revolutionary fighters armed with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, have established a revolutionary outlook on life of serving the people wholeheartedly, can sacrifice the "small self" for the "big self," and can "worry before the world worries, and enjoy after the world enjoys." At the same time, the interests and development of the revolution include the interests and development of individuals, and only the development, success, and victory of the revolution can lead to individual development. For example, in the current revolutionary stage, if all workers, peasants, intellectuals, and the national bourgeoisie who are oppressed by the Kuomintang do not unite to overthrow the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, no one can live a free and happy life. Therefore, individual interests must and can be completely consistent with the interests and development of the revolution. However, there is also such a situation, that is, at some point, individual interests may conflict with the interests of the revolution. At this time, as a revolutionary, one should unconditionally sacrifice individual interests and must not sacrifice the interests of the revolution to serve individuals. Individual interests obeying revolutionary interests is a Marxist principle.

Although the general interests of the revolution include individual interests, they still cannot be fully included, such as family illnesses and other issues. Naturally, these issues should be taken care of as much as possible, and the leadership should pay special attention to the progress and lives of cadres. In fact, it is well known that our Party, government, and military have long had measures to give preferential treatment to cadres and their staff. However, limited by material conditions, and the Kuomintang reactionaries have not been completely defeated, and the recovery and development of industrial and agricultural production are urgently needed, it is currently impossible to universally and completely take care of the families of all staff members. It can only be done according to actual difficulties and within our capabilities. Even doing this is not for anything else, but also for the overall interests of the revolution, to guarantee the minimum living and working conditions of cadres, so that they can work with peace of mind and enthusiasm. If someone participates in the revolution only to solve their personal family life, otherwise they think that "revolution is cruel," then that is completely wrong.

Finally, I want to remind you that the personal difficulties of cadres should be taken care of as much as possible within our capabilities, but we should also broaden our horizons and see what kind of lives the broad masses of people who have experienced disasters are living! Look at how the thousands of revolutionary fighters and staff members who have experienced arduous struggles have spent difficult fighting years for more than 20 years, and today they are still being selfless in their work and practice thrift. Their heroic behavior of being so loyal to the people is by no means something that those most selfish and cruel people in the world can do. The four families of Chiang, Soong, Kung, and Chen scraped away the people's wealth and still felt it was not enough. Aren't they making a last-ditch struggle and "scraping the marrow from the bones"?

　　个人利益与革命利益
    ——致“微笑”君公开信之二
    董谦
    至于你所说的，当在革命的队伍中，看到供给制不能解决“一切个人与家庭的困难”时，“禁不住掉下几点心酸泪”？！霎然听来，好象这是表现了你具有“人忧其忧”的“美德”，不过这种“美德”正构成你认为“革命是残酷的”道德观。那么这种道德观究竟是革命的唯物论的呢，还是退化的唯心论的呢？在这里必须划清它的界线，才能进一步分清是非。
    是的，作为一个革命者，均应具有最伟大最高尚的一切美德，但这种美德是建筑在辩证唯物论的科学之上，是建立在无产阶级解放与人类解放战斗的利益之物质的基础之上；而不是建筑在退化的、保护个人及少数剥削者的利益基础之上。这就是说，革命的道德是科学的、阶级的产物，而不是超阶级的、独立的抽象的人道主义。我们党的领袖之一刘少奇同志在“党员思想意识的修养”一文里，即曾明确而坚定地昭示我们说：“我们不承认在阶级社会中有所谓更伟大更科学的、超阶级、一般的道德，这只是骗人的鬼话，这在事实上只是建筑在保障少数剥削者利益之基础上的所谓‘道德’。从来的这种‘道德’观，都是唯心论的。”
    问题这就很明白了，虽说你曾“掉下几点心酸泪”，但由于不是或不完全是从人民的长远利益出发，就恰恰暴露了你的小资产阶级的人道主义和同情心。
    因为“共产党不只是代表各个党员的利益，而是代表全体工人们与人类解放的长远的利益。……所以不要把共产党看作只是图谋党员私利的、狭义的、行会主义的小团体。”（“党员思想意识的修养”）
    共产党在二十八年中，为什么长期艰苦奋斗，为什么实行最低生活的供给制的真谛，正是处处为了人民的长远利益，为了减轻人民的负担和痛苦，而与人民共疾苦，同度此艰辛的日子。而参加革命者，都是自愿而来，又是自觉自愿地牺牲个人利益绝对服从革命利益的。这和反革命的国民党只是为了个人升官发财，贪图享乐，不顾人民死活，有着本质的不同。可是，你要认识这样一个真理：即在国民党那里纵然可以“赚”大钱，可以“养活”父母妻子，可是这样的人有多少呢？他们赚的钱又是那里来的呢？还不都是搜括的老百姓的血汗吗？这样虽说少数达官显贵可以饱暖无忧，却苦了广大劳动人民，终年劳动不得一饱，如此说来，这能说革命是“残酷”的，而反革命是“仁慈”的吗？你可曾知道这个“仁慈”的外衣下，践踏了多少人民的生命！
    你为了证明“自私心是不能连根除去”这一论点的正确，就否认了革命者最高尚的美德，就否认了革命者是最觉悟的无产阶级的先锋战士，就否认了“只有工人阶级最有远见，大公无私，最富于革命的彻底性，”（“人民民主专政”）这一特质，而把他们降低到普通人的水平，这就完全错了。
    世界革命导师斯大林曾代表全党在苏联第二次苏维埃代表大会上宣读的誓词中说：“我们共产党员是具有特种性格的人，我们是由特殊材料制成的。伟大无产阶级战略家底军队，列宁同志底军队，就是由我们这些人组成的。”（“联共（布）党史”第七章第四节）
    但这并不是说，一个革命者因为是“特殊材料制成的”就没有一点个人的利益了，而是说他们已经被马列主义和毛泽东思想武装起来的革命战士，已经确立了全心全意为人民服务的革命人生观，能够牺牲“小我”为“大我”、能够“先忧其忧、后乐其乐”；同时，革命的利益和发展就包括着个人的利益和发展，也只有革命的发展、成功与胜利，才有个人的发展。如在目前革命的阶段，一切受着国民党压迫的工人、农民、知识分子、自由资产阶级，若不团结起来，共同打倒国民党反动统治，谁也不可能过着自由幸福的生活。因此，个人的利益必须而且可能与革命的利益和发展完全取得一致。不过也有这样一种情形，即在某种时候，个人的利益，也可能与革命的利益发生矛盾，这时候，作为一个革命者，就应该无条件的牺牲个人利益，而不能牺牲革命的利益来服从个人。个人利益服从革命的利益，这是马克思主义的原则。
    虽说革命的一般利益中包括着个人的利益，但总还不能完全包括，如家庭疾病等问题；自然，这些问题均应该尽量照顾，在领导上更应特别关心干部的进步和生活，事实上，人所共知，这在我党政军各方面早定有优待其干部及其工作人员的办法。但是限于物质条件，以及国民党反动派还没完全打倒，工农业生产又急待恢复和发展，所以在目前还不可能普遍地完全照顾一切工作人员的家庭，只能根据实际困难，量力而作。就是这样作，也不是为了别的，也是为了革命的整个利益，保障干部最低的生活条件、工作条件，使他们安心的热情的工作。设若有人参加革命仅仅是为了解决个人家庭生活，否则就认为“革命是残酷”的，那就完全错了。
    最后，我还要提醒一句，干部个人的困难是应该在可能范围内尽力照顾，但我们还应放大眼界，看看历经灾难的广大人民还过着什么样的日子！看看历经艰苦奋斗的万千革命战士及工作人员，二十余年来是怎样度过艰难战斗的岁月，而今天还在克己奉公，厉行节约，他们这样忠心耿耿为人民的英雄行为，绝非那些世界上最自私和残酷的人们所能做到的。蒋宋孔陈四大家族刮尽了民脂民膏，犹嫌不足，不是正在作垂死挣扎和“敲骨及髓”吗？
