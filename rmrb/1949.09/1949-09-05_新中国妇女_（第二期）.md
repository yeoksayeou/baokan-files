　　"New Chinese Women" (Issue 2)
    He Zai
    Published by New China Women's Publishing House, distributed by Xinhua Bookstore

    This issue includes reports from various aspects, from cities to villages, from factories to schools (factory correspondence, reports on rural women's movements, introductions to work experience, and multiple essays by female workers, female staff members, and students). In addition, there is also Comrade Cai Chang's speech on "Several Issues Concerning Women Workers' Work" at the National Trade Union Work Conference. This article points out the importance of women workers' work in factories, how to understand women workers' work, the tasks and scope of women workers' work, as well as detailed explanations of the organizational structure of the women workers' department and its relationship with the Women's Federation, which solves many problems in women workers' work. The world's great revolutionary teacher Lenin's "On Free Love" and Comrade Li Peizhi's "Brief Discussion on Youth's Love and Marriage" are of great help to the current young men and women friends in their stance, views, and attitudes towards free love. Zhang Zhongshi's "New Democracy Revolution" explains what is meant by revolution, what conditions determine the tasks and nature of the revolution, what category of revolution the current stage of China's democratic revolution belongs to, and how China's New Democracy differs from the New Democracy of Central and Eastern European countries. It is a good reference article for studying Chairman Mao's "On New Democracy". Li Keng's "Infant Development and Training" is general knowledge that every mother with children urgently needs to know. Wen Jize's popular science speech "From Wildfire to Electric Stove" is excellent reading material for young friends who aspire to study science. In addition, there is Shen Zijiou's "Welcoming the New Political Consultative Conference", Luo Qiong's "The Essence of Women's Oppression", Wang Lin's short story "Revenge Shoes", Hu Sheng's "Combination of Scientificity and Revolutionarity", and Wu Lao's "Wang Xiuluan Comic Strip"... further strengthening the diversity and vibrancy of this issue's content.
