The Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference is like the sun rising in the East, radiating light that shines across all of China and throughout the world. All people are cheered and encouraged by its birth. It provides the Chinese people with a path forward, granting them freedom, peace, and happiness. At the same time, it tolls the death knell for China's old era. Therefore, it is an unprecedented grand gathering for the founding of the nation in Chinese history, and for the Chinese people.

In the past, during the transition of each dynasty in Chinese history, there were also some "grand ceremonies" for the "founding" of the nation, but those were nothing more than one oppressor and exploiter being replaced by another oppressor and exploiter. It was still a minority ruling over the majority of the people, which is what is commonly known as "changing the dynasty." Therefore, they were all "empty shells" with "new bottles for old wine."

Today's People's Political Consultative Conference not only differs fundamentally in nature from the "founding" of past dynasties, but also, in Chinese history, it is the truly well-deserved unprecedented grand ceremony for the founding of the nation.

Because it is no longer a "change of dynasty," it is the first time in nearly a century of sacrifice and struggle that the Chinese people have fundamentally overthrown thousands of years of feudal rule and the rule of imperialism and comprador bureaucrats, and have stepped onto China's historical and political stage. On this "political stage," the working class and peasantry never had a place in the past dynasties. Even the peasant uprisings that once occurred, such as the uprising of tens of thousands of people led by Chen Sheng and Wu Guang at the end of the Qin Dynasty, the nationwide Yellow Turban Rebellion in the Later Han Dynasty, the peasant uprising led by Dou Jiande during the Sui Dynasty, the peasant army uprising led by Huang Chao during the Tang Dynasty, Song Jiang's uprising in Shandong during the Northern Song Dynasty, the uprising of hundreds of thousands of people led by Wang Xiaobo and his brother-in-law Li Shun in Sichuan, the uprising led by Zhong Xiang and Yang Tai in Hunan during the Southern Song Dynasty, the peasant uprising led by Liu Futong in Yingzhou during the Yuan Dynasty, and Li Zicheng's uprising in northern Shaanxi during the late Ming Dynasty, although these uprisings were also very powerful and shook the reactionary rule, because these peasant uprisings did not represent a certain new mode of production in history, nor did they have progressive political ideas, nor did they have advanced class leadership, they were often exploited by new landlords and nobles, and became tools for feudal forces to compete for power with each other; and before long, some were knocked off the political stage again, and some changed the original nature of the uprising, betraying the interests of the people, and therefore, it was still a "change of dynasty." Take the Xinhai Revolution led by Mr. Sun Yat-sen as an example. Although it overthrew the rule of the Qing Dynasty and established the "Republic of China," because it did not completely defeat the feudal forces, first there was Yuan Shikai's claim to the throne, and then there was Chiang Kai-shek's betrayal of the revolution, colluding with the remaining feudal forces internally and relying on imperialism externally, dreaming of becoming an "emperor" every day. Although at the beginning of the War of Resistance Against Japan, under the pressure of the people, he convened an "unprecedented" "Political Participation Council" and passed some "unprecedented" resolutions, but they were resolved but not implemented; although he also convened an "unprecedented" "Political Consultative Conference" after the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan under the pressure of the people and passed some "unprecedented" "nation-building" agreements, but before long, they were torn up by him; not long after, he convened an "unprecedented" fake "National Assembly" under his sole control and elected an "unprecedented" "President"; but this "unprecedented" "National Assembly" had neither people's representatives participating nor passed a resolution on "founding the nation"; on the contrary, it passed many "unprecedented" resolutions betraying the country and betraying the nation, selling out from the sky to the ground, and the Chinese people lived an even more enslaved life, so the old "Republic of China" became an unprecedentedly dark and reactionary dynasty in history.

But the people finally ended the political situation of "changing dynasties" for three thousand years. Today, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, history has been completely turned upside down. The historically oppressed classes—the working class, the peasantry, the petty bourgeoisie, and the national bourgeoisie—have become the masters of the new society and the new China, while the historically oppressive classes—the feudal class, the comprador bureaucratic class, and imperialism—after their reactionary rule was overthrown, the entire class perished with it. Therefore, whether it is the "feudal dynasty" or the "Chiang family dynasty," they are all gone forever. The Political Consultative Conference truly composed of representatives of the people themselves is unprecedented in history; its composition is so broad, with representatives from the Communist Party, various democratic parties, various people's organizations, various regions, the People's Liberation Army, various ethnic minorities, overseas Chinese, and other patriotic democratic elements participating; the number of representatives is as high as 662; in terms of age, there are those as old as eighty or ninety, and those as young as twenty; in terms of class, there are the working class, the peasantry, the petty bourgeoisie, the national bourgeoisie, and other patriotic democratic elements, fully representing the will of the people of the whole country, which is an unprecedented political organizational form. At the same time, these classes, under the leadership of the working class and the Communist Party, unite and thereby establish a people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance, "fundamentally changing the face of China." Therefore, who can say that this People's Political Consultative Conference is not an unprecedented grand ceremony for the founding of the nation by the Chinese people?

The old China has passed away, and the new China has been born. This is the reason why the people's "founding of the nation" today truly deserves to be called unprecedented.

### 开国的空前盛点

　　开国的空前盛点
    董谦
    中国人民政治协商会议，犹如太阳升起在东方，光芒四射，照耀到全中国，照耀到全世界，一切的人民都为它的诞生而欢欣鼓舞，它给予中国人民以前进之路，它给予中国人民以自由、和平与幸福，同时它为中国的旧的时代敲了丧钟，因此，它是中国历史上，也是中国人民开国的空前盛会。
    过去中国历史上在每个朝代的更替时，也曾有过一些“开国”的“盛典”，但那些都不外乎由一个压迫者剥削者，换成另一个压迫者剥削者，还是少数人统治多数人民，这就是通常所说的“改朝换代”；因之，都是“换汤不换药”的“空壳”。
    今天举行的人民政治协商会议，不仅与过去历代的“开国”有着根本性质的不同，而且在中国历史上说，它才是真正名符其实的开国的空前盛典。
    因为它已不是“改朝换代”了，它是中国人民经过近百年来的牺牲奋斗，从根本上推翻了几千年来的封建统治，和帝国主义、买办官僚的统治后，第一次登上了中国的历史政治舞台，这个“政治舞台”上在过去多少朝代里从没有工人阶级农民阶级的地位，即便一度出现过的农民起义，如秦末陈胜、吴广数万人的起义，后汉全国性的黄巾之“乱”，隋时窦建德的农民起义，唐时黄巢的农民军起义，北宋宋江的起兵山东，王小波及其妻弟李顺在四川领导的数十万人的起义，南宋钟相、杨太在湖南领导的起义，元时农民刘福通的起兵颖州，明末李自成的起义陕北，虽说这些起义声势也很浩大，震撼了反动的统治，但因为这种农民起义并没有代表历史上一定的新的生产方式，也没有进步的政治思想，没有先进的阶级领导，所以常被新的地主贵族所利用，为封建势力互相争夺政权的工具；而为时不久，有的又被打下政治舞台，有的变了原来起义的性质，背叛了人民利益，因之，还是一个“改朝换代”。就以孙中山先生领导的辛亥革命来说，虽然推翻了满清统治，建立了“中华民国”，但由于没有彻底打垮封建势力，先有袁世凯的称帝，后有蒋介石背叛革命，对内勾结封建残余势力，对外依附帝国主义，无日不在做着“皇帝”的幻梦。他虽在抗战之初，在人民压力下，召开过“空前”的“参政会”，通过了一些“空前”的决议，但决而不行；他虽也在抗战胜利之后，在人民压力之下，召开过“空前”的“政治协商会议”，通过了一些“空前”的“建国”协议，但为时不久，也被他一手撕毁；其后不久，还是在他一手包办之下，开了一个“空前”的伪“国大”，选举了一个“空前”的“大总统”；但这个“空前”的“国大”既没有人民代表参加，又没通过“开国”的决议；相反的却通过许多“空前”的卖国叛国的决议，一直从天上卖到地下，中国人民更加过着被奴役的生活，所以，旧的“中华民国”即成了历史上空前黑暗的反动朝代。
    但是人民终于结束了三千年来“改朝换代”的政治局面。今天在中国共产党的领导下，已把历史完全翻了一个个儿，历史上的被压迫阶级——工人阶级、农民阶级、小资产阶级、民族资产阶级——成了新社会新中国的主人，而历史上的压迫阶级——封建阶级、买办官僚阶级、帝国主义——在其反动的统治被颠覆之后，整个阶级即随着灭亡。因之，“封建王朝”也好，“蒋家王朝”也好，均已一去不复返了。真正由人民自己的代表所组成的政治协商会议，这才是历史上空前未有的；其组成的成份是多么广泛，共产党、各民主党派、各人民团体、各地区、人民解放军、各少数民族、国外华侨及其他爱国民主分子，都有代表参加；代表的人数，有六百六十二人之多；从年龄上说，有老至八九十岁的，有小至二十多岁的；从阶级上说，有工人阶级、农民阶级、小资产阶级、民族资产阶级及其他爱国民主分子，完全足以代表全国人民的意志，这才是空前未有的政治组织形式。同时这些阶级在工人阶级及共产党的领导之下，团结起来，并从而建立工人阶级领导的以工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政的国家，“根本上变换了中国的面目”，因此，这个人民政治协商会议谁能说不是中国人民开国的空前的盛典呢？
    旧的中国已逝去了，新的中国已诞生，这就是今天人民“开国”之所以真正称得起空前的理由。
