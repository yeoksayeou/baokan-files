　　"Little Cucumber"
    Guan Lu
    In the autumn of 1947, I lived with a team of Liberation Army soldiers in a village in Jiaodong. This village was in Haiyang County, not far from the sea.
    This village was very beautiful, with mountains, a small river, and gurgling spring water flowing down from the mountains. At the foot of the mountains were fields, and in the fields grew sweet potatoes and beans. There were also vegetable plots, and in the vegetable plots grew scallions. Right behind a large sweet potato field was a well, and behind the well were two village houses. The house on the left was inhabited by ordinary people, who kept a pig and a donkey. The donkey didn't sleep at night, just kept munching on grass, and I lived next door to the donkey.
    You know, in the countryside, it's very inconvenient to use cold water. You have to take a bucket to the well, fill it, and then haul it up. People without strength can't manage it.
    One afternoon, the weather was very sultry, and I took a water bucket to draw water. As I walked out the door, the clouds in the sky were struggling with the sun, making the sun blink, sometimes bright, sometimes dim. When I got to the well, the sun was gone, the sky was dark, and a strong wind whipped up sand and dust. Many children were shouting, "It's going to rain! It's going to rain!"
    I was afraid of the rain, and I was very anxious to quickly draw the water and go home. But the bucket was being difficult, and the more anxious I got, the less it wanted to come up. I was sweating profusely with anxiety.
    Just when I was at my wit's end, a boy ran past. He was very thin, with a round face. His eyes were narrow and squinting. His hair was long and stuck up like a little hedgehog. He smiled at me and said in a high-pitched voice, "Let me help you!" He acted quickly, and before I could agree, the bucket of water was up. He worked quickly and bravely. After the water was up, he still wouldn't let go, and said, "Let me take it back for you!" Again, without my permission, he picked up the bucket of water and ran off. I had no choice but to run after him. As I ran, I thought, "This child has a strong work ethic!" And then I thought, "How does he know where I live?" Thinking this, I suddenly noticed his hair sticking up, his feet covered in yellow dirt, one pant leg long, the other short, and no shirt on. I realized then that he was the boy who came to my house every morning to pull scallions from the vegetable patch.
    We had just reached the doorway when the rain began to pour down. We were lucky; our clothes didn't get wet. He walked into the house, put the bucket on the ground, and left without a word. I was afraid he would get caught in the rain, and I called him back. As I chased him to the door, he stopped, squinted at me, and smiled. I said, "Wait until the rain stops before you go!" He smiled again and said, "We farmers aren't afraid of the rain." But he came back. At that moment, I felt like I had many questions to ask him, and it seemed like he had many things to say to me. We both felt very familiar with each other, as if we had known each other for a long, long time.
    He sat on the threshold and started chatting with me.
    He asked me where I came from, whether I knew how to farm, whether I had seen Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu. He also asked me when the reactionaries would be defeated, what Chiang Kai-shek looked like, where he lived, and what Chiang Kai-shek ate every day. He even asked if Chiang Kai-shek could kill people himself.
    After asking me these questions, he told me about himself.
    He told me that his surname was Xiao, and his name was Wanghua, but people called him "Little Cucumber." He said he didn't like the name "Little Cucumber" because cucumbers break easily. He said he was twelve years old this year, too young to fight the enemy, but when he grew up, he wanted to be a Liberation Army soldier. His home was next to the vegetable patch in front of my house, near the bean trellis. He had a father and a mute younger sister, and four mu of land, which they had received during the land reform.
    He also told me that his father was very old and had asthma. All the heavy work in the fields fell to him. He had to plow the soil, spread fertilizer, pull weeds when it rained, and carry water from the well to the fields when it was dry. In the winter, he had to go up the mountain to collect firewood. He had also joined the Children's Corps, and he and the Children's Corps checked travel permits together. At this point, he hummed in his throat, drawing out the sound, "The spies can't escape us!" At night, he also went on patrol, acting as a little militia. He also had another job: when the grain came in, he had to dry the wheat and millet, put some in a bucket, and hide it in a pit in the mill to prepare for paying the public grain to support the front lines.
    As he spoke, I looked at him closely. He was pitifully thin, and his back and chest were just bones. His arms were thin and green, just like cucumbers. I secretly worried about him, fearing that he would be crushed by the load when he carried water. I also wondered if he would be killed by spies if he went on patrol at night. So I asked him, "Can you handle all this work?" He looked at me and said, "We need to eat, we need to drink, and we need to fight the reactionaries. We can't do without any of it. We have to, even if we can't!" He spoke in a loud, forceful voice, and I believed him. I thought, "He's much more useful than I am!"
    As we were talking, the sky cleared. He suddenly jumped up and said, "I have to go to the fields to finish my tasks." He turned to leave. As he went out the door, he looked at my bucket and said, "I'll come help you draw water next time!"
    From that day on, he often came to my house to play. When he came, he wouldn't say anything, just look at my bucket. Naturally, I didn't want him to draw water for me. But several times when I came home, my empty bucket was full.
    One day, I was walking through the sweet potato field when I saw Little Cucumber squatting in the middle of the field, his face covered in dirt, like a little monkey. When he saw me, he quickly waved to me, indicating that I should come over quickly. I thought he was going to complain that I had stepped on his seedlings and wanted to criticize me. When I walked over, he quickly held out his hand and said, "Here, have this!" I looked and saw it was a large sweet potato, red and round, as if it were smiling, just like his face. He gave me the sweet potato, squinted his eyes, smiled, and then bent down to turn the vines. I didn't really like sweet potatoes, but from that moment on, I loved them. But I couldn't bear to eat this one. I washed it clean and put it on the table. One morning, as I walked out the door, I saw Little Cucumber standing next to the vegetable patch, crying. I asked him, "Why are you crying?" He lifted his leg and showed me a scraped spot. I asked him how he got it. He said, "I fell." I laughed at him, "You're crying because you fell? You're going to fight the enemy in the future!" When he heard me say that, he quickly wiped away his tears and stopped crying. I pulled him inside, washed the dirty spot for him, put on some red medicine, and bandaged it up. He smiled and said, "You're good." After saying that, he saw the sweet potato on the table and said, "Why haven't you eaten it yet?" I said, "I'm saving it, I'll take it with me later." He understood what I meant. He stood for a while, and as he was leaving, he pointed to the sweet potato and said, "Eat it, I'll give you another one!"
    About half a month later, as Mid-Autumn Festival approached, an order came from above saying that the reactionaries were going to attack Jiaodong, and we were to move elsewhere. We all became busy: the Liberation Army soldiers were packing their luggage and preparing to leave; the ordinary people were busy hiding their grain. They had to hide their grain completely so that the reactionaries wouldn't be able to eat anything.
    I hadn't seen Little Cucumber for several days. I hadn't seen him turning vines or picking scallions. That morning, I went to his house to find him, to tell him that I was leaving tomorrow. He wasn't home. His father was sitting in front of the stove, stoking the fire, and his mute younger sister was turning dried sweet potato pieces in the stove. When she saw me, she grinned foolishly at me, as if to welcome me. I asked where Little Cucumber had gone. His father said he had gone to the Children's Corps. He also said that he had been very busy these past few days, digging trenches in the mountains every day. Sometimes his sister had to take him food. I had no choice but to return home.
    That night, I lay in bed for a long time, unable to sleep. When I closed my eyes, I kept thinking about Little Cucumber: his round face, his thin arms, his smiling eyes; him drawing water for me, giving me sweet potatoes, him being so kind to me, him always being so happy to see me, as if I were his family.
    Around midnight, I decided to go see him again the next morning, but he would be gone at the crack of dawn, would I even see him? As I was thinking this, a gust of wind suddenly blew up outside, making the paper on the window flap loudly. My thoughts were blown away by the wind. At this moment, mixed in with the sound of the wind, I heard a kind of sound outside the door, a "gudong gudong" sound. This sound wasn't like a person walking, or a pig snoring, or the cow next door eating grass, or the howling of the distant sea. What was it like? I couldn't figure it out. I was a little scared. "Could there be bad guys?" Thinking of bad guys, I immediately thought of Little Cucumber. He said that he and the militia took turns on patrol. I believed that if there really were bad guys, he would tell me. I was both suspicious and afraid. Before I knew it, the wind stopped, the paper on the window slowly turned white, dawn broke, and the sound was gone.
    At daybreak, the wake-up whistle blew in our team. We quickly got up to pack our luggage. Just as I was rolling up my bedding, ready to go to the assembly point, Little Cucumber came in. His face was covered in yellow mud, and he was holding a large handful of scallions. His mute younger sister followed behind him. He seemed very happy to see me, but he couldn't speak. I asked him, "Where have you been these past few days?" He said, "Hiding grain!" I said, "I'm leaving, do you know?" He nodded, didn't speak, but smiled. His eyes were sparkling, as if he were about to cry. I asked him, "What are you going to do with so many scallions?" He said, "I'm giving them to you. You won't have any scallions to eat after this." I asked him, "Why did you pull up the scallions?" He said, "We buried them all." I walked to the opening and looked at the vegetable patch. Sure enough, the green scallions that had been growing yesterday were all gone, and all that was left were weeds. I asked him, "When did you bury them?" He said, "Last night." He hadn't slept all night to bury the scallions. I realized then that the "gudong gudong" sound I had heard at night.
    The assembly whistle blew. Little Cucumber carried my luggage for me, and his mute younger sister carried the scallions for me, and they escorted me to the assembly point. On the way, he asked me, "Are you coming back?" I said, "I'm coming back." He said, "Good, you come back and live in my house. I'll save big taro for you to eat." I saw that his voice was a little shaky as he spoke, not as sharp and clear as usual. I asked him, "Are you afraid of the reactionaries?" He said, "I'm not afraid." I asked him, "What will you do when the reactionaries come?" He said, "I'll climb into the mountain caves during the day and fight them at night. They won't have anything to eat and won't be able to stay." I looked at him again. He was looking down, his spirits not very good. I said, "I think you're still a little scared. Why are you always so listless?" He said in a very small voice, "I'm afraid you won't come back!" He didn't speak anymore, but walked quietly beside me. I wasn't very tall to begin with, and with him, I felt even taller. He seemed so small and pitiful! But thinking about his tasks and work, I felt that he was tall and great, while I was thin and small!
    We finally set off. Our team was in front, and Little Cucumber, with his mute younger sister, and many other ordinary people were behind us to see us off. When we were half a li away from the village, I looked back and saw that some of the people who were seeing us off had gone home, some had gone to the fields, and the mute younger sister was also gone. Only Little Cucumber was still on the high bank, shielding his eyes with his hand, watching our team from afar.
    The following autumn, after the reactionaries were defeated, I returned to that village again. After returning, I lived in the same house as before. I drew water from the well again, and saw the sweet potato field and vegetable patch again. Sweet potatoes were growing in the field again, and the scallions in the vegetable patch were green again. People were turning the vines and working in the fields, but I didn't see Little Cucumber. Where had Little Cucumber gone? I looked for him everywhere, but I couldn't find him. I went to his house, but his house had been burned down and his home was gone. As I was searching, a child came out of the Children's Corps club. I saw that it was Little Cucumber's mute younger sister. When she saw me, she quickly ran over and grabbed my clothes. Tears were in her eyes, and she couldn't speak. I pointed to her house. She understood what I meant. I was looking for Little Cucumber. She pointed towards the mountains. I thought that Little Cucumber had probably gone up the mountain. So I followed the direction she pointed. To go up the mountain, you had to walk across an open space. As soon as I reached that open space, I saw several graves on the ground. Among the graves was a very small new grave, with a wooden plaque on it. The plaque had several large characters written on it:
    "Little Cucumber, People's Hero."
    After seeing this, my head felt a little dizzy. I felt that I wasn't in the same village anymore, but in a new place! I wanted to cry.
    I didn't go forward, but turned back to the village office. When I got to the village office, I learned the following:
    Last year, when the reactionaries came, they burned many houses and buried many ordinary people alive. One day, Little Cucumber was caught while on patrol. After he was caught, the enemy asked him where the grain was hidden, but he wouldn't say. The enemy threatened him, demanding that he tell them, but he said, "If I tell you, I won't hide it anymore." The enemy said, "If you don't tell us, we'll tie you to a tree and beat you to death." After saying that, a reactionary soldier took a rope and a large leather whip and placed them in front of him. Little Cucumber didn't say anything for a long time, but finally shouted, "Just because you can beat people, I won't tell you!"
    The reactionaries were very angry. Two secret agents immediately came forward, took off Little Cucumber's clothes and pants, tied his thin arms back, feet up, head down, to a tree by the river. His face turned purple, and the bones on his chest were clearly visible. After they tied him up, a secret agent took a thick leather belt and whipped the small Little Cucumber heavily. The sound of Little Cucumber's cries made all the dogs in the village bark, but he didn't reveal where the grain was hidden. Later, Little Cucumber fainted, closed his eyes, and couldn't cry or shout. The reactionaries untied him, laid him on the ground, and splashed cold water on his face. He woke up and looked at his enemies with great anger.
    The reactionaries asked him again, "Tell us, where is the grain?" He didn't answer again. The enemy said, "If you don't tell us, we'll kill you!" He raised his head from the ground and shouted hatefully, "If you kill me, the Eighth Route Army will come and kill you!"
    Little Cucumber didn't speak again. After a while, the enemy dug a pit in the open space and buried Little Cucumber!
    When I heard this, I didn't want to cry. I felt very angry. I wanted to kill all those reactionaries and avenge Little Cucumber!
    However, by the time I finished telling this story, Little Cucumber's revenge had already been avenged. The ones who avenged him were the brave and skilled Liberation Army soldiers who had eaten the sweet potatoes and grain he had grown. They drove back the reactionaries who attacked Jiaodong and captured all the enemies!

　　“小黄瓜”
    关露
    一九四七年秋天，我和一队解放军住在胶东的一个庄子里，这个庄子在海阳县，靠海不远。
    这个庄子很漂亮，有山，有小河，还有从山上流下来的咕呀咕呀的泉水。山下面有田，田里面长了地瓜和豆子。还有菜田，菜田里长了葱。就在一大片地瓜田后面有一个井，井后面有两座庄屋。左面一座庄屋住的是老百姓，老百姓家里养了一条猪和驴子，驴子夜里不睡觉，尽咕吱咕吱地吃草，我就住在驴子隔壁。
    你们知道，在乡下要使用凉水是很不方便，要拿桶到井里去，水灌满了桶再提上来。这样，没有劲儿的人可办不到。
    有天下午，天气很闷热，我拿了水桶去打水。走出门的时候，空中的云彩正在和太阳斗争，把太阳斗得直眨眼睛，一会儿明一会儿暗的。走到井边，太阳没有了，天空乌黑，大风把沙土卷起来，许多小孩子叫着：“要下雨了！要下雨了！”
    我怕下雨，心里很着急，想赶快把水打上来，赶回家去。谁知那个水桶和我闹情绪，我越着急，它越不肯上来。急得我满头大汗。
    我正在没办法的时候，旁边跑过一个男孩子，他的身体很瘦，脸很圆。眼睛细得眯眯的。头发很长，竖起来象个小刺猬。他望着我笑了一笑，尖声尖气地向我说：“我帮你打吧！”他的动作很快，说完之后，没有得到我的同意，那桶水就上来了。他干得又快又勇敢。水打上来之后，他还不肯放手，又说：“我给你送回去吧！”说完之后，又不得我的同意，就提上那桶水呼呼地跑。我没有办法，跟在他后边跑起来。一边跑我一面想：“这个孩子的劳动观点真强啊！”又想：“他怎么知道我的家呢？”想到这里，我忽然看见他的头发竖起来，两只脚上尽是黄土，裤管一只长，一只短，上身没有穿衣服，我这才想起，他就是每天上午来到我的房子面前，在菜地上拔葱的那个孩子。
    我们两个刚刚跑到家门口，大雨花啦花啦地下起来。我们的运气很好，衣服都没有打湿。他走进房里，把水桶放在地下，一句话不说，掉脸就走。我怕他出去淋雨，叫他回来，刚追出门口，他站住了，眯着眼睛望我，笑了一笑。我说：“等雨下完了再走吧！”他又笑起来说：“我们庄稼人不怕雨。”但是他回来了。这时，我好象有许多话想问他，他也有很多话要和我说的样子。我们俩个互相都感到很熟悉，好象认识了很久很久一样。
    他坐在门槛上，和我谈起天来了。
    他问我从那里来的？问我会不会种地？问我看见过毛主席和朱总司令没有？又问我反动派几时才能打垮？蒋介石长的是什么样子？住在什么地方？还问我蒋介石天天吃什么东西，他自己会不会杀人？
    问过我这些问题之后，他就告诉我他的事情。
    他告诉我他姓萧，名字叫旺华，人家就叫他“小黄瓜”。他说他不爱听这个“小黄瓜”是一碰就断的。他说他今年十二岁，不能打敌人，长大了要当解放军。他的家就在我前面的那块菜地旁边，有扁豆架子的那里。他家里有一个父亲，一个哑吧妹妹，四亩田地，地是土改的时候分来的。
    他又告诉我，他的父亲年纪很大，还得了气喘病。田里的重活都归他。他要翻土，弄粪，下雨的时候要拔草，天干的时候要把井里的水挑到田里去。冬天他要上山拾柴禾。他还加入了儿童团，他和儿童团一起去查路条。说到这里，他的嗓子里嗡地哼了一声，把声音拉的很高说：“特务碰着我们是逃不掉的！”夜里他还去放哨，充当小民兵。他还有工作呢：粮食下来的时候他要把小麦和小米谷晒干，装一份在桶里，藏在磨房里的坑里准备缴公粮，支援前线。
    他说话的时候，我细细地看他。他瘦的可怜，背心和胸脯上尽是一条一条的骨头。胳膊又青又细，真象黄瓜一样。我暗暗地给他担心，怕他挑水的时候给担子压倒了。又想，他如果夜里去放哨，会不会给特务掏死呢？这时我就问他：“这多活你干得了吗？”他望望我说：“要吃，要喝，要打反动派，一样不能少，干不了也不行啊！”他说的声音很高，很有力气，我很相信他。我想：“他比我有用多了！”
    我们说着话，天晴了。他突然跳起来说：“我要下田完成任务去了。”说完就走。出门的时候，望望我的水桶说：“我下回再来给你打水啊！”
    从这天起，他常常到我家来玩，来了以后，不说话，望望我的水桶。我自然是不要他打水的。但是当我好几次出门回来之后，我的空水桶都是满的。
    有一天，我走过地瓜田，看见小黄瓜蹲在田中间，脸上又是泥土，象个小毛猴一样。他看见我，急忙向我招一招手，意思是叫我赶快过去。我心里以为是他说我踩了他的苗子，叫我过去，给我提意见。等我走过去，他很快地伸过一只手来，嘴里说：“给你吃！”我一看，原来是一个大地瓜，那个地瓜长得又红又圆，好象还会笑，就象他的脸一样。他把地瓜交给我，眯上眼笑了一笑，低下头，翻秧子去了。我本来不很爱吃地瓜的，从这时候起，我爱吃地瓜了。不过这个地瓜我不舍得吃我把他洗干净，放在桌上。有一天早上，我刚走出门看见小黄瓜站在菜地旁边，在哭呢。我问他“为什么哭？”他把腿抬起来，把破了的一块给我看，我问他怎么弄的？他说“跌了。”我就笑他：“跌了一跤还要哭，将来还要打敌人呢！”他听见我这么说赶快擦干眼睛，不哭了。我就拉他进来，给他把那块跌脏的洗掉，上点红药水，给他包起来。他笑了，说：“你好”。说过之后，望见桌上的那个地瓜，说：“你怎么还不吃呢？”我说：“我留着它，将来带走。”他懂得我的意思。站了一会，临走的时候，指着那个地瓜说：“你吃了吧，我再送你！”
    隔了半个月，快到中秋节了，上面来了一道命令，说是反动派要进攻胶东，叫我们搬到别处去。我们大家都忙起来：解放军整顿行李，准备出发；老百姓忙着藏粮食。他们要把粮食藏得干干净净，反动派来一点东西也吃不到。
    好几天我都没有看见小黄瓜了，不见他翻秧子，折葱叶。这天早上我上他家去找他，准备告诉他我明天要走了。他不在家，他的父亲坐在灶门前烧火，他的哑吧妹妹在灶里翻地瓜干子。她看见我，傻头傻脑地望我笑，表示欢迎的样子。我问小黄瓜那去了，他父亲说上儿童团去了。他又说他这几天忙得很，天天到山上去挖壕坑。有时还要他妹妹去送饭呢。我只好回来。
    这天晚上，我上床躺了半天，睡不着觉。闭上眼睛就想着小黄瓜：他圆圆的脸，精瘦的胳膊，笑眯眯的眼睛；他替我打水，送我地瓜，他对我那么好，他见了我总是那么高兴，好象我就是他的亲人。
    想到半夜，决定明早上再去看他，但是他天一亮就出去的，我是不是能看到他呢？想到这里，外面忽然刮起一阵大风，风把窗子上面的纸吹得呼啦呼啦的，我的思想被风刮跑了。这时候夹在风声里面，我听见门外面有一种声音咕东咕东的。这种声音不象人走路，不象猪打呼，也不象隔壁的牛在吃草，又不象很远很远的海水呼啸的声音。象什么呢，我一下想不出来。我有些害怕，“不会是有坏人吧？”想到坏人，我立刻又想到小黄瓜他说他和民兵轮流放哨，我相信如果真有坏人，他会告诉我的。我一面怀疑，一面害怕，不知不觉风声停了，窗户上的纸慢慢地发白，天亮了，声音也没有了。
    天刚亮我们队里就吹了起身的哨子。赶快起来收拾行李。正捆好铺盖卷，预备去集合的时候，小黄瓜进来了，他满脸都是黄泥，手上拿了一大把葱，哑吧妹妹跟在后边。他看见我好象很高兴，但是说不出话来。问他“这几天那去了？”他说：“藏粮食去了！”我说：“我要走了，你知道吗？”他点点头，不说话，嘴里在笑，眼睛里亮晶晶的，好象要哭的样子。我问他“拿那么多葱干什么？”他说：“送给你的，你往后没有葱吃了。”我问他：“为什么把青葱拔下来？”他说：“我们都埋掉了。”我走到开口，看了看那片菜地，果然，昨天下午还长着的绿油油的葱，现在一棵也没有了，剩下的全是乱草，我问他“几时埋的？”他说：“昨天夜里。”他为了埋葱，一夜没有睡觉。我这才明白夜里我听见的那种咕东咕东的声音。
    集合哨子吹起来了，小黄瓜替我背着行李，哑吧妹妹替我拿着葱，送我到集合的地方去。在路上他问我：“你还回来吗？”我说“要回来的。”他说：“好，你回来住在我家里，我留大芋头给你吃。”我看他说话的时候声音有些颤抖，不象往常那么尖亮，我就问他：“你怕反动派吗？”他说：“不怕。”我问他“反动派来了，你怎么样？”他说“我白天爬山洞，晚上和他拼，他们没有东西吃，呆不住的。”我又看看他，他低着头，神气不大好，我就说：“我看你还是有些害怕。你怎么老没有精神呢？”他用很小的声音说：“我怕你不回来！”他再不说话了，静悄悄走在我旁边。我的个儿本不高，和他在一起，我觉得我又大又高，他小得可怜！但是想到他的任务和工作，我觉得他又高又大，而我是又瘦又小了！
    我们终于出发了。我们的队伍在前面，小黄瓜带着他的哑吧妹妹，和许多老百姓一起在后面送我们。走出庄子半里路的时候，我回头看一看，送我们的老百姓有的回家了，有的到田里去了，哑吧妹妹也不见了，只有小黄瓜一个人还在高高的堤上，用手掌遮着太阳，在远远望着我们的队伍。
    第二年秋天，反动派被我们打退之后，我又回到那个庄上，回去之后，我又住到原来的房子里，我又到井里打过水，又看见那片地瓜田和菜地。田里又长了地瓜，菜田里的葱又长得绿油油的。田地都有人在翻秧干活，但是没有看见小黄瓜。小黄瓜那里去了呢？我到处找他，都看不见。我找到他家里，他的房子烧掉了家也没有了。我正在找的时候，儿童团俱乐部里出来一个孩子，我一看是小黄瓜的哑吧妹妹。她看见我，赶快跑过来，拉住我的衣服。眼睛里含着泪，说不出话来。我指指她的家，她明白我的意思，我是找小黄瓜，她就用手往山那面一指。我想大概小黄瓜上山去了。我就顺着她指的方向走过去。上山去是要走过一片空地的，我刚走到那片空地的时候，看见地面上有几个坟堆，坟堆里有一个很小的新坟，上面树了一个木牌，牌上写了几个大字：
    “人民的英雄小黄瓜。”
    看了之后，我的头有些发晕，觉得我不是在原来的庄子里，而是到了一个新的地方了！我想哭。
    我不向前走了，回过头到村公所去。到了村公所，我知道了下面的事情：
    去年反动派来的时候，烧了很多房子，活埋了许多老百姓。有一天小黄瓜在放哨的时候被抓了。抓去之后，敌人问他粮食在那里，他不说。敌人威吓他，硬叫他说，他说：“我要告诉你我就不藏了。”敌人说：“你再不说我们就把你捆在树上，打死你。”说完之后，一个反动派士兵拿了一根绳子，和一条大皮鞭放在他的面前。小黄瓜半天不响，最后叫起来：“就因为你们会打人，所以我不说！”
    反动派气得很，立刻上来两个特务把小黄瓜的衣服裤子脱掉，把他精瘦的胳膊反过去，脚向上，头向下，绑在小河边的一棵树上。他的脸色发紫，胸脯上的骨头显得一条一条的。绑好之后，一个特务就拿起一条又粗又大的皮带子，在瘦小的小黄瓜身上重重地抽起来。小黄瓜哭喊的声音使全村子的狗都叫起来了，但是他没有说出粮食藏在什么地方。打到后来，小黄瓜晕过去，闭住眼睛，不会哭，也不会叫了。反动派把他放下来，躺在地下，用凉水喷在他的脸上，他醒了，很忿怒地望着他的敌人。
    反动派再问他：“快说，粮食在那里？”他又不响，敌人说：“再不说把你杀了！”他把头从地上抬起来，恨恨地叫了一声：“你要杀我，八路来了杀你！”
    小黄瓜再不说话，空了一会，敌人在空场上挖了一个坑，把小黄瓜埋了！
    我听到这里，不想哭了我觉得很忿怒，我想杀掉那批反动派，给小黄瓜报仇！
    不过，我讲完这个故事的时候，小黄瓜的仇早已报了。替他报仇的就是吃过他种的地瓜和粮食底那些勇敢善战的解放军。他们打退了进攻胶东的反动派，把敌人都俘虏了！
