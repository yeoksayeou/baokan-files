Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 8th: Polish News Agency, Mexico City dispatch: The Americas Peace Congress opened on September 5th. More than one thousand representatives from various countries in the Americas participated in the congress. Millions of people warmly welcomed the delegations attending the meeting.

　　The Mexican delegation consisted of 600 members, mainly composed of workers and peasants. The United States delegation had 200 members. The next largest delegations were from Canada, Argentina, and Brazil. French writer Garaudy, poet Eluard, and Cuba's Marinello represented the World Peace Congress at the meeting, and the World Peace Congress paid tribute to the Mexico Congress.

　　Congress Chairman Martinez delivered the opening speech, emphasizing that the Congress represents the true democratic forces of the American continent, who are uniting to oppose the imperialists attempting new conquests. The Congress must explain to the people of the Americas the dangers caused by the activities of the war-mongers. Martinez also said that the Congress would establish a permanent peace committee.

　　After the reading of a speech by former Mexican President Cárdenas, the president of the Latin American Labor Federation, Toledano, spoke next. He emphasized that the current struggle for lasting peace is a continuation of the anti-fascist battles on the battlefield. He said: "Our response to the instigators of war must be the unity and consolidation of the forces of peace." Toledano also pointed out the necessity of establishing a Pan-American Committee for the Defense of Peace representing all countries of the American continent, and the necessity of formulating a clear program for active struggle for peace. He said: "We must put the struggle against the arms race, exposing all conspiracies of warmongers, stopping the production of atomic weapons, and defending human rights and democracy in the first place." Toledano then spoke about the role of the Soviet Union in the struggle for peace. He emphasized that peaceful cooperation between different political and economic systems is entirely possible. He said that the movement to peddle war shows that the United States plans to conquer the world, that this movement is threatening world peace and human culture. This movement is also a threat to the independence of Latin American countries. Latin American countries must work together to defend lasting peace.

    大会主席马丁尼兹致开幕词，他着重指出：大会代表美洲大陆的真正民主力量，他们正团结起来反对企图进行新征服的帝国主义者。大会必须向美洲各国人民说明战争贩子活动所引起的危险。马丁尼兹并说：大会将成立一个常设的和平委员会。
    在朗读墨西哥前总统卡敦纳斯的演辞之后，拉丁美洲劳工联盟主席托列达诺继起发言。他强调说：目前争取持久和平的斗争，是以前在战场上的反法西斯战斗的延续。他说：我们对战争挑拨者的回答，必须是和平力量的团结和巩固。托列达诺并指出成立一个代表美洲大陆所有国家的泛美保卫和平委员会的必要性，和拟订为和平而积极斗争的明确纲领的必要性。他说：我们必须把反对军备竞赛、揭发战争贩子一切阴谋、制止原子武器生产和保卫人权及民主制度的斗争，放在第一位。托列达诺接着说到苏联在和平斗争中的作用。他着重地说：不同的政治与经济制度间的和平合作，是完全可能的。他说：贩卖战争的运动，表明了美国计划征服全世界，表明了这一运动正威胁着世界和平和人类的文化。这个运动也是对拉丁美洲国家独立的威胁。拉丁美洲的国家必须共同努力，以保卫持久的和平。
