　　Celebrating the Great Unity of World Democratic Youth
    The Second World Democratic Youth Congress, led by Soviet youth, victoriously opened on September 2nd. This symbolizes the great gathering and unity of world democratic youth. The representatives of world democratic youth, who have undergone various severe tests, are gathered together to summarize their fighting experience, review their strength, in order to better strive for a consolidated and lasting peace, and strive for a beautiful future for mankind. Such a conference, its great political significance, cannot but arouse universal praise from progressive people all over the world. To welcome this conference, Chinese youth have widely held grand celebrations throughout the country, and universally conducted internationalist education to strengthen the further close unity between Chinese youth and world youth. The Chinese people believe that the Chinese people's cause of liberation is closely related and inseparable from the struggle of world youth for liberation. The convening of the World Youth Congress is the greatest and most enthusiastic encouragement to the Chinese people who are advancing bravely and thoroughly eliminating the reactionaries in order to devote all their efforts to the cause of domestic peace and construction. On the occasion of the victorious opening of this conference, we would like to extend our cordial greetings and warm congratulations to the outstanding representatives of world democratic youth, and wish the conference a successful victory!
    To celebrate the Second World Democratic Youth Congress, what should Chinese youth do?
    First of all, it is necessary to widely carry out universal and in-depth internationalist propaganda and education among young people. Chinese youth are one of the important components of the international democratic youth team, and we should closely link the struggle of our youth in our own country with the international youth democratic movement. We must be extremely enthusiastic about the international youth movement, support the World Federation of Democratic Youth, which enjoys extremely high prestige among the vast number of young people internationally, and support the Second World Democratic Youth Congress, which represents the great unity of international democratic youth. Carry out extensive and in-depth propaganda and celebration activities. Mobilize all young people to participate! Through this movement, the consciousness of internationalism of Chinese youth will be enhanced.
    To do this, the most important task must be to learn from Soviet youth. Soviet youth and their delegations reflect the moral, ideological, and cultural aspects of the young generation that Lenin and Stalin once nurtured with great care. The victorious socialist system has opened up unlimited prospects for young people to fully develop their intelligence and physical strength. Soviet youth have rich experience in the struggle against imperialism, and at the same time, they have rich experience in the construction of socialist countries. In the years of the Great Patriotic War, they took up arms and, with self-sacrificing spirit, were loyal to the motherland and defeated the enemy; immediately after the war, they dedicated their strength to peaceful labor and study, and were involved in socialist labor competitions, striving to complete the post-war Stalin Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule, and striving to master advanced technology and science. Soviet youth are the vanguard of freedom-loving youth all over the world. They receive full internationalist education, and they do everything possible to support the struggle of world democratic youth against imperialism. Chinese youth must learn from Soviet youth, learn everything from them, and always use Comrade Stalin's praise of them: "Always standing in the forefront of our soldiers," "Never lagging behind the events of our revolutionary life" to spur themselves on. Celebrating the World Youth Congress is the best opportunity to mobilize young people across the country to study enthusiastically and consciously transform themselves.
    The World Democratic Youth Congress has great political importance, and is a close unity of democratic youth all over the world, and a great demonstration against warmongers. The unity of world youth has shattered the imperialists' attempts to establish reactionary organizations to oppose international democratic youth, and shattered all the persecution and attacks of Wall Street, the Vatican, the British ruling clique, and the fascist bandit Tito clique. The representatives attending the meeting issued the unanimous call of world democratic youth: "Swear to stand with the Soviet Union and fight against the new instigators of war with all our strength." This is a just call, which will more powerfully inspire the heroic struggle of world democratic youth, once again help world youth distinguish between friends and foes, draw a clear line between classes, stand in the international democratic camp headed by the Soviet Union, follow the Soviet path, carry forward the spirit of the youth vanguard, and severely attack all instigators of war, and support and defend the lasting peace of the world.

　　庆祝世界民主青年大团结
    以苏联青年为首的世界民主青年第二次代表大会已于九月二日胜利开幕，这象征着世界民主青年的大会师和大团结。曾经经过各种严重考验的世界民主青年代表们欢聚一堂，总结斗争经验，检阅自己力量，以便更好的争取巩固与持久的和平，争取人类美满的未来，这样的大会，它的重大政治意义，不能不引起全世界进步人类的普遍赞扬。为了迎接这一大会，中国青年在全国各地广泛地举行了盛大庆祝，普遍进行国际主义教育，以加强中国青年与世界青年进一步的亲密团结。中国人民认为，中国人民解放事业同世界青年争取解放的斗争息息相关，是不可分离的，世界青代大会的召开对于正在奋勇前进，彻底肃清反动派，以便全力投入国内和平建设事业的中国人民，是一个最大的，最热烈的鼓舞。当此大会胜利开幕之际，我们愿向世界民主青年的优秀代表们致亲切的慰问和热烈的庆贺，并预祝大会胜利成功！
    庆祝世界民主青年第二次代表大会，中国青年要作一些什么呢？
    首先要在青年中广泛进行普遍深入的国际主义的宣传教育，中国青年是国际民主青年队伍里重要组成部分之一，应将我们青年在本国的斗争同国际青年民主运动密切连结起来，要以极大热忱关切国际青年运动，拥护在国际广大青年中拥有极高威信的世界民主青年联盟，拥护代表国际民主青年大团结的世界民主青年第二次代表大会。广泛深入地开展宣传和庆祝运动。动员全体青年参加！通过这一运动来提高中国青年国际主义的自觉性。
    要这样做，最重要的工作就必须是向苏联青年学习，苏联青年及其代表团反映着列宁斯大林曾经亲切培养的年青一代的道德、思想和文化等各个方面。胜利的社会主义制度已给青年开辟了充分发展智力体力的无限前途，苏联青年有着丰富的反对帝国主义斗争经验，同时又有丰富的社会主义国家建设经验，他们在卫国战争的年代，手执武器，以自我牺牲精神，忠于祖国，战胜敌人；在战后立刻把自己的力量贡献给和平的劳动和学习，卷入了社会主义劳动竞赛，努力争取提前完成战后斯大林五年计划，力求精通先进的技术和科学。苏联青年是全世界爱好自由青年的先锋队，他们接受着充分的国际主义的教育，他们尽一切方法支持世界民主青年反对帝国主义的斗争。中国青年必须向苏联青年看齐，学习他们的一切，要时刻以斯大林同志对他们的赞誉：“总是站在我们战士的前列”，“从来没有落在我们革命生活事件后面”来鞭策自己。庆祝世界青年代表大会，正是动员全国青年热烈学习，自觉改造自己的一个最好机会。
    世界民主青年代表大会具有巨大的政治重要性，是全世界民主青年亲密团结，对战争贩子的大示威。世界青年的团结曾经粉碎了帝国主义者建立与国际民主青年相对抗的反动组织的企图，粉碎了华尔街，梵蒂冈，英国统治集团以及法西斯匪帮铁托集团的一切迫害和进攻。这次到会的代表们发出了世界民主青年一致的呼声：“誓与苏联站在一起，全力与新战争挑拨者斗争”。这是正义的呼声，它更加有力地鼓舞世界民主青年的英雄斗争，再一次帮助世界青年分清敌我，划清阶级，站在以苏联为首的国际民主阵营，走苏联的道路，发扬青年先锋队精神，痛击一切战争挑拨者，拥护与保卫世界持久的和平。
