　　Welcoming the Asian-Australian Workers' Representative Conference
　  Deepening Internationalism Education
　  Municipal Federation of Trade Unions Holds Propaganda and Education Meeting Yesterday
    [This Municipality News] The Propaganda and Education Department of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions convened a propaganda and education meeting yesterday (the 15th) morning. More than 60 propaganda and education cadres from 57 trade union units in various factories, districts, and industries attended. Zu Tiangong, Deputy Minister of the Propaganda and Education Department, reported on the current domestic situation and then stated that the Asian-Australian Workers' Representative Conference will be held in Peiping in November. This is a result of the victorious development of the Chinese revolution and also the glory of the Chinese people. This victory would not have been possible without international assistance. Therefore, the Chinese people, especially the working masses, should warmly welcome and entertain the representatives from various countries coming to Peiping to express internationalist solidarity and friendship. To this end, we must carry out in-depth internationalist education in various factories, industries, and workers' night schools in various districts. The Propaganda and Education Department of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions has compiled various propaganda and education materials for use by various factories, districts, and industries. In addition to classes, various factories, districts, and industries should also make full use of blackboards, big-character posters, broadcasts, and other means to carry out publicity. In addition, symposiums should be organized, and workers should be organized to visit the Soviet construction photo exhibition. Subsequently, Comrade Zeng Ping, director of the Trade Union Club, reported on issues related to club and workers' cultural and recreational work, and planned to organize a joint performance by workers from various factories in October to welcome the Asian-Australian workers' representatives. He hoped that all units would actively prepare.
