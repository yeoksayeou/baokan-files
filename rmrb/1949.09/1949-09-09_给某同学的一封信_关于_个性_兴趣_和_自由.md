　　A Letter to a Certain Student Regarding "Individuality," "Interests," and "Freedom"
    Hua Jiayue

    You say your personality is not suitable for the military. The things you learned in school before are now completely forgotten, and they're of no use at all. In the new environment, you have to learn everything from scratch, and you feel like it's a waste of your previous study time and what you learned. You feel that you haven't achieved anything significant in the military, and your name is never mentioned in the work summaries of each stage. You feel that teaching a few songs, reading the newspaper, teaching addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division is enough for primary and middle school students to handle, and there's no need to make a college student do it. Therefore, in the military, you only feel "life is monotonous," "not lively," "no change," "mentally unhappy," "actions are not free," "knowledge hasn't improved," and thus you are depressed and disheartened, and you are always eagerly wanting to jump out of the military and go back to school to study for a few more years and become an expert.

    I think you feeling unable to display "individuality," lacking "interest," and having no "freedom" in the army is mainly a problem of not having transformed your class standpoint, not having established the viewpoint of "serving the people," and not having let go of "personal interests" and "student airs."

    What exactly is the set of things you learned in the past? I think it can't escape Western bourgeois culture! In the set of things you learned in the past, whose interests does the law protect?! Whose rights does the politics safeguard?! Whose wealth does the economy create?! Science, is it a tool for whom?! If these things that serve the bourgeoisie are not fundamentally transformed from a different standpoint and re-recognized, is it any wonder that "they are of no use at all now"? Naturally, "everything has to be learned anew." The old set of things can no longer be completely used today!

    What was your past way of life like? "Do whatever you want," is that called freedom? Is that called interest? Is that called individuality? No! That is the lifestyle of the bourgeoisie or the petty bourgeoisie. Therefore, in the new way of life, it makes you feel distant and depressed.

    In the new society, individuality, freedom, and interests are all based on social collective life and collective interests. So-called "individuality" that is divorced from collective interests is the "individuality" of individual heroism. "Freedom" that is divorced from the constraints of collective life is the anarchy of laxity and destruction. "Interests" that are divorced from initiative and creativity in labor and work are merely the narrow and selfish desires of individualists who are "happy only for themselves." Only when you have a thorough understanding of these things, transform your bourgeois, individualistic standpoint, and wholeheartedly serve the people, then your thoughts can escape the old shackles, and your individuality, freedom, and interests can be developed in the people's cause. Conversely, depression and discouragement will only deepen your own ideological errors, and will never solve the problems that exist within you.

### 给某同学的一封信　关于“个性”“兴趣”和“自由”

　　给某同学的一封信　关于“个性”“兴趣”和“自由”
    华家越
    你说你个性不适合于部队，从前在学校里学得的一套东西，现在都忘记光了，而且一点都用不着，在新环境里，一切都得从头学起，觉得浪费了以前学习的时间，和所学得的东西；你觉得在部队里没忙出啥成绩来，每一阶段的工作总结中，没有你一份工作表现；你觉得教几个歌，读读报，教加减乘除，中小学生已够应付，用不着委屈一个大学生去干，所以在部队只觉得“生活刻板”，“不生动”，“没变化”，“精神不痛快”，“行动不自由”，“学识没长进”，因而苦闷、消沉，整天价急急蹦蹦想蹦出部队，重新回学校读他几年书，做个专家。
    我想你在军队里感觉到不能发挥“个性”，缺乏“兴趣”，没有“自由”，这主要的是阶级立场还未转变的问题，是“为人民服务”观点还未建立的问题，是“个人利益”、“学生架子”还未放下的问题。
    你过去所学的一套是什么东西？我想逃不出西方资产阶级的文化吧！在你过去所学的一套里面，法律，是保障谁的利益的法律？！政治，是维护谁的权利的政治？！经济，是使谁发财的经济？！，科学，是为谁服务的工具？！这些专为资产阶级服务的东西，如果不把它从基本不同的立场上加以改造，重新加以认识，“现在一点都用不着”有什么奇怪？自然，“一切都得从新学起”。旧的那一套东西，已经不能完全用之于今天了！
    你过去的生活方式怎样？“要怎么的就怎么的”，这叫自由吗？这叫兴趣吗？这叫个性吗？不！这是资产阶级或小资产阶级的生活方式，因之，在新的生活方式中，就使你感到有距离，有苦闷。
    在新社会里，个性、自由和趣味，都是建立在社会集体生活与集体利益的基础上，离开了集体利益的所谓“个性”，是个人英雄主义的“个性”，离开了集体生活约束的“自由”，是无政府主义的散漫与破坏，离开了劳动和工作中的积极性和创造性的“趣味”，这只是个人主义者“独乐其乐”的狭隘自私的欲望。只有对这些有了彻底的认识，把自己那个资产阶级的、个人主义的立场转变过来，全心全意为人民服务，那么，你的思想才能脱出旧的羁绊，你的个性、自由、趣味就能在人民的事业中得到发挥，反之，苦闷和消沉只有加深自己思想上的错误，永远也解决不了你本身所存在的问题。
