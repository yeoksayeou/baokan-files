　　"Getting Stuck in a Rut" in Learning!
    Tian Min
    While studying the history of social development, I discovered the following situation:

    One group, when discussing the question of worldview, debated this issue: "What is a worldview?" There were two different opinions: one was: "A worldview is why people should live?" The other was: "A worldview is why people live?" So, the group engaged in a heated debate, arguing whether "worldview" is "why should one live?" or "why does one live?" Of course, there would be no conclusion.

    Another group, also discussing worldview, someone raised this question: "If a person is kept in a room from infancy until the age of twenty, without contact with anyone else, does this person have a worldview? And what would their worldview be like?" Again, there were many different opinions, and no agreement could be reached.

    Such learning is obviously not beneficial to us. The above examples are very prominent, but in reality, similar learning methods are still quite common, especially among young intellectuals. This is worth examining.

    The first example above gets bogged down in the wording, going back and forth without grasping the substance and spirit of the issue, wasting time and energy on debating words. The second example starts from a hypothetical situation that clearly does not exist and could not exist, to study and discuss the issue. Using these two attitudes to study the question of worldview will certainly not allow us to criticize and eliminate incorrect worldviews, and establish correct worldviews; and obviously it won't be fruitful to use them to study any other issue. The essence of this "getting stuck in a rut" learning method is dogmatic learning.

    The basic characteristic of correct learning methods is being good at grasping the spirit and essence of theory, being good at connecting and exposing one's own actual life and thoughts, being good at uncovering daily struggles, and not starting from words and fantasies, circling around in words and fantasies. Chairman Mao said: "We must study Marxism-Leninism purposefully and integrate it with the actual movement of the Chinese revolution" ("Reform Our Study"). In the broad wave of learning, we should always remember these two sentences.

### 学习上的“钻牛角尖”！

　　学习上的“钻牛角尖”！
    田敏
    在学习社会发展史的时候，发现了下面这样的情形：
    有一个小组在讨论人生观问题时，争论这样一个问题：“什么叫人生观？”有两种不同的意见：一种是：“人生观就是人为什么要活着？”另一种是：“人生观就是人活着为什么？”于是小组内就展开热烈的争辩，“人生观”到底是“为什么要活着”呢？还是“活着为什么”呢？当然不会有结果。
    另一个小组，也是讨论人生观，有人提出这样一个问题：“假如有一个人从婴孩时起到二十岁，一直关在房间里，不与其他任何人接触，那么这个人有没有人生观呢？他的人生观又如何呢？”于是又众说纷纭，莫衷一是。
    这样的学习，对于我们显然没有好处。上面的例子是很突出的，但在实际上，类似这样的学习方法却仍然相当普遍地存在，尤其在青年知识分子中。这是值得检查的。
    上面的第一个例子，是把问题伫留在字眼上翻来复去，而不去领会问题的实质与精神，在字眼的争辩上枉费时间精力。第二个例子则是从一个明明不存在而也不可能存在的假设出发，来研究问题，讨论问题。以这两种态度来研究人生观问题，固然不能借此批判肃清不正确的人生观，建立正确的人生观；即用来研究任何别的问题，也显然不会有结果。这种“钻牛角尖”的学习方法的本质，便是教条主义的学习方法。
    正确的学习方法的基本特点，是善于领会理论的精神与实质，善于联系并暴露自己的实际生活与思想，善于发掘日常的斗争，而不是从字眼与空想出发，在字眼与空想中打圈子。毛主席说：“要有目的的去研究马列主义，要使它与中国革命实际运动结合起来”（“改造我们的学习”）在广泛的学习热潮中，我们应时刻记住这两句话。
