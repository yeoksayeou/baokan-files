　　Conveying the Resolutions of the People's Representatives Conference
  　Tibetan People in Beiping Rally
  　Resolutely Opposing Imperialist Aggression Against Tibet
    [This newspaper's report] Dorje Tsetan, a Tibetan representative of minority ethnic groups attending the Beiping Municipal People's Representatives Conference, convened a meeting of Tibetan people from the agricultural, commercial, and monastic circles in Beiping on the morning of the 4th to convey the resolutions of the People's Representatives Conference. Dorje Tsetan began by saying: "During my participation in the conference, I was constantly excited and happy. I deeply felt that all ethnic groups have achieved true equality, democracy, and unity. Although we Tibetans are small in number, we still have one representative participating, which is the greatest manifestation of the People's Government's policy towards minority ethnic groups and stands in stark contrast to the reactionaries." After praising the democratic spirit of the conference and introducing in detail the various resolutions on building a new Beiping, he called on the Tibetan people in Beiping to actively implement the resolutions. For example, the lamas of the Yellow Temple have joined the upsurge of developing production since liberation, cultivating more than 30 mu of land nearby themselves. This spirit is commendable and should be actively promoted and carried forward. Speaking of future tasks, he said: "Now, there are still Tibetans in the vast areas awaiting liberation who are listening to the deceptive propaganda of the reactionaries and have unclear and fearful mentalities. We must step up our propaganda to dispel these doubts, which is our responsibility. In addition to propaganda, we should also directly participate in the liberation war to rescue millions of suffering compatriots from the abyss of misery and enable them to enjoy the happiness of liberation like us. For example, recently, British and American imperialism wants to reduce our Tibetan compatriots to colonial slaves. We believe that the power of the people is infinitely great. Any imperialism that dares to oppose the Chinese people will be smashed to pieces. The forces of imperialism cannot be allowed to exist on every inch of the people's motherland." He emphasized: "The People's Government has voiced the ethnic equality desired by all minority ethnic groups for thousands of years and is fighting heroically for the liberation of all minority ethnic groups within China."
    He pointed out that the Tibetan people are suffering from the oppression of imperialism and Han and Tibetan reactionaries, all of which we should completely eradicate.
    After the conveyance, Sonam Woser, a representative of the Tibetan business community, said: "Since the occupation by the Japanese reactionaries, we have been like children without parents. Now we have found our own parents—the People's Government. We have a backer and are not afraid of being oppressed and bullied by others. We must work hard." Xin Danzeng, a farmer representative of the Yellow Temple Lama, continued to speak: "We must do a good job in propaganda, we must abide by the law, and develop production, but we don't know anything, we don't understand. There are many Tibetans like us, and we hope the government will help us." The meeting lasted for two and a half hours.

　　传达各界代表会决议
  　在平藏民集会
  　坚决反对帝国主义侵略西藏
    【本报讯】出席北平市各界代表会议的少数民族藏民代表多杰才旦于四日上午召集在平农、商、僧各界藏民传达各界代表会决议。多杰才旦首称：我在参加大会期间，无时无刻不在兴奋快乐中。我深深地感觉到各民族作到了真正的平等民主团结。我们藏族人数很少，也有代表一人参加，这就是人民政府对少数民族政策的最大表现，与反动派可以作一个显明的对照。他在盛赞大会民主精神与详细的介绍了大会中对建设新北平的各种决议案后，号召在北平的藏民积极执行各项决议。例如黄寺喇嘛在解放后参加到发展生产的热潮中，自己耕种附近的三十余亩田。这种精神值得称赞，并且应积极的推广发扬。谈到今后任务时，他说：现在还有广大的待解放区的藏民听受反动派欺骗宣传而有不明了和恐惧的心理，我们要加紧宣传来扫除这些疑虑，这就是我们的责任。除宣传以外，我们更应当直接参加到解放战争中使千百万受苦受难的同胞从火坑中拯救出来，同我们一样地享受解放的幸福。例如最近英美帝国主义想把我们西藏的同胞沦为殖民地牛马，我们相信人民的力量是无比伟大，那一个帝国主义敢与中国人民作对，非把它碰得焦头烂额不可。在人民祖国的每一寸领土上，都不能让帝国主义的势力存在。他着重说明：人民政府替各个少数民族喊出了千百年来所愿望的民族平等，并为解放中国境内各少数民族而英勇奋斗。
    他指出西藏人民正遭受着帝国主义和汉、藏反动分子的压迫，这一切都是我们应当彻底铲除的。
    传达完毕后，藏民商界代表索南若紫说：我们从日本反动派占领以来就等于无父无母之子女，现在已经找到了亲生父母——人民政府，有了靠山，不怕别人压迫欺辱，我们要好好努力。继由黄寺喇嘛农民代表辛丹增发言：“我们要好好作宣传，我们要守法，发展生产，但是我们什么也不知道，不懂得，我们藏族这样的人很多，希望政府帮助一下。”会议历两小时半结束。
