    General Liao Yunzhou Discusses the Transformation of His Troops After the Uprising

    Recently, the reporter interviewed General Liao Yunzhou, who led an uprising in the Huaihai Campaign last year. General Liao said excitedly: This People's Political Consultative Conference demonstrates the great unity of all the Chinese people, which guarantees the smooth and successful construction of a new China in the future. Then General Liao talked about the situation after the uprising: Since he led the uprising in the Suxian and Luoji areas, he received a warm welcome from the masses in the northern Anhui liberated area. The telegrams of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu greatly educated the officers and soldiers who participated in the uprising, and they underwent a new transformation in their thinking. During the reorganization in Luyi, they launched a campaign to speak out about their sufferings during their studies. The poor brothers who had suffered hardships recognized the root causes of their oppression. They distinguished the essential differences between the two kinds of armies. They understood who was for the people and who was against the people, and gradually began to establish the idea of serving the people. They began to have some understanding of mass discipline, military-civilian relations, and officer-soldier relations. When they arrived in Luohe, they participated in the celebration meeting of General Chen Geng's Fourth Column and received a practical education. They expressed infinite admiration for the heroic models who had made contributions to the people, and felt great shame for the past misdeeds of the old army in disturbing and harming the people. In order to further improve their understanding, the officers above the rank of battalion commander requested that the troops be merged and reorganized with the People's Liberation Army in order to better learn from them.
    After the reorganization and study, he said that their troops had indeed made new progress. At the oath-taking rally for the advance into Jiangnan, entire batches and even companies of commanders and fighters bit their fingers to write blood pledges, requesting that they be given arduous and difficult tasks and that they be the first to cross the river. He said that only troops under the leadership of the Communist Party could have such heroic spirit. Speaking of this, he gave two more examples to prove that only troops under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party can consciously adhere to the established rules of mass discipline. On the way to Jiangnan, most of them camped in the open, and the soldiers never went to the houses of the masses to rest. When the common people sent firewood for them to make a fire, they politely declined. Along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi line, no soldier picked up the quilts and socks left behind by the bandit troops.
    General Liao said to me that the People's Liberation Army loves the common people, and the common people love the People's Liberation Army. The military and the people are one, and only then can victory be achieved in combat. He said that when they were in the Jingjiang area, the scouts of the People's Liberation Army disguised themselves and went behind enemy lines. One soldier was wounded and was in danger of being discovered by the enemy at any time, but when the local villagers saw the wounded soldier, they immediately changed him into civilian clothes and carried him around the enemy-occupied area for more than fifty miles, safely sending him to the place where the People's Liberation Army was stationed. After the villagers left, the People's Liberation Army discovered that there were two pounds of bacon, two silver dollars, and eight pounds of rice on the stretcher where the wounded soldier was sleeping. This story deeply moved General Liao. He said, "The people love the People's Liberation Army so much that I feel very happy in my heart. If we don't serve the people well, we will be letting the people down too much."
    Finally, he said that if we want the army to truly serve the people and become the people's army, we must first consolidate the political work system, improve the army's political awareness, thoroughly establish the idea of serving the people, and fight against the old ideas at all times and in all places. With a high degree of determination to sacrifice, we must wash away the old, corrupt work style and attitude, establish a new troop style based on the three major democracies, and strive to transform ourselves to build a people's army under the leadership of Chairman Mao.

　　中国人民政协代表访问记
  　人民的伟大教育
    廖运周将军谈起义后部队的改造
    陈迹
    最近记者访问了去年淮海战役起义的廖运周将军。廖将军兴奋的说：这次人民政治协商会议，表现了全中国人民大团结，这就保证了今后建设新中国的顺利成功。接着廖将军谈到起义后的情形：自从他在宿县、罗集一带起义以后，得到皖北解放区群众的热烈欢迎，毛主席、朱总司令复电的感召，给起义的官兵们以很好的教育，他们在思想上起了新的转变。在鹿邑休整时，他们在学习中展开了诉苦运动，受苦的穷弟兄们，从此认识了自己受压迫的根源。他们分清了两种军队的本质的不同。他们了解到谁为人民，谁反人民，渐渐的初步的树立起为人民服务的思想，对于群众纪律，军民关系，官兵关系，都开始有了一些认识。到了漯河，他们参加了陈赓将军第四纵队的庆功大会，得到了现实的教育，对于为人民立功的英雄模范表示着无限的景慕，对于以往旧军队的扰民害民感觉莫大耻辱。为要进一步提高自己的认识，他们的营长以上的干部请求把部队和人民解放军合并整编，以便更好地学习。
    经过整编学习以后，他说他们部队确有了新的进步。在进军江南誓师大会上，有整批整连的指战员咬指写血书请求给他们艰苦困难的任务，让他们坐第一船过江，这样英雄的气概，他说，只有在共产党领导下的部队才能有这种表现。说到这里，他又举了两个例子来证明在中国共产党领导之下的部队，才能自觉的恪守群众纪律的定例。在向江南进军的途中，多半露天宿营，战士们从没到群众屋里去休息，当老百姓送柴草给他们烤火时，他们和蔼地谢绝了。在浙赣沿线，匪军遗留下来的被褥鞋袜，也没有一个战士去捡拾的。
    廖将军对我说，人民解放军爱护老百姓，老百姓热爱解放军，军民一体，作战方能胜利。他说，当他们在靖江一带时，解放军的侦察员化装到敌后去，有个战士负了伤，随时有被敌人发现的危险，但是当地的老乡们看见了这个伤员，马上给他换了便衣，抬着他绕了敌人占领的地区五十多里路，安全地送到解放军驻扎的地方，当老乡们离开以后，解放军才发现在伤员睡的担架上还放着两斤腊肉、两块现洋和八斤大米。这个故事，深深地感动了廖将军，他说，“人民这样地爱护解放军，使我心里感到万分高兴，我们再不好好为人民服务，那太对不起人民了。”
    最后他谈到，要想军队真真为人民服务，成为人民的军队，首先必须巩固政治工作制度，提高军队政治觉悟，彻底建立为人民服务的思想，随时随地要和旧的观念作斗争，以高度的牺牲决心，洗刷旧的腐朽的工作作风和态度，建立以三大民主为基础的新的部队作风，努力改造自己，在毛主席领导下，建立人民军队。
