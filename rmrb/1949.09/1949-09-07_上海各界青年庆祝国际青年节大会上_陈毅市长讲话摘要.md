Mayor Chen Yi's Speech Summary at the Shanghai All-Circles Youth Celebration of International Youth Day

　　【Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 5th】Mayor Chen Yi's speech at the Shanghai All-Circles Youth Celebration of International Youth Day on the evening of the 1st is summarized as follows:

　　Mayor Chen first expressed revolutionary greetings to the youth of all circles on behalf of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Shanghai People's Municipal Government, and the East China People's Liberation Army. He pointed out that the international youth movement is not simply a movement of intellectual youth, but a movement of youth workers, youth farmers, youth students, and youth of all strata. The emergence of International Youth Day is the result of the glorious history of struggle of the international youth movement over many years.

　　Mayor Chen traced the occurrence and development of the international youth movement, and gave examples to illustrate the role of the Chinese youth movement in the revolutionary movement. He said: In the late 19th century and early 20th century, the development of world capitalism entered the era of imperialism, and persecution and oppression were first imposed on the youth workers of various countries. In peacetime, they forced young workers to do excessive labor that damaged their health—creating profits for capitalism; in wartime, they drove young people to fight for imperialism, euphemistically calling it "patriotism." In colonies and semi-colonies, the reactionary big bourgeoisie and landlord class turned to the imperialist camp, betrayed national interests, and used slogans such as "national supremacy" and "state supremacy" to drive young people to do anti-people things. However, the youth masses are not easy to bully. The reactionary behavior of imperialism and its lackeys in oppressing the youth will inevitably provoke resistance from the youth masses and promote the youth's awakening and unity. Because the expansion of imperialist aggression broke through national barriers and exceeded national borders, their oppression of youth was also without national boundaries. Therefore, the youth masses of various countries rose up to oppose imperialism and its lackeys, also breaking through national borders and rapidly transforming into a great unity of international youth, forming a strong international youth anti-imperialist force. The youth masses of various countries often stand at the forefront in the struggle against imperialism, fighting to protect the interests of the youth themselves, which is actually fighting to protect the interests of the people of the world.

　　The role of our Chinese youth in the revolutionary movement is the newest and most vivid example of the international youth movement. Because the profound contradiction between imperialist aggression against China and traitors betraying the nation first aroused resistance from young people, prompting them to become the vanguard of the revolutionary movement. From the May Fourth Movement, the May 30th Movement, the Northern Expedition, the War of Resistance Against Japan, and this People's Liberation War, Chinese youth have stood on the front line of struggle, engaging in life-and-death battles with imperialism and domestic reactionary rule. In recent years, in the old liberated areas, the powerful youth forces of workers, peasants, and intellectuals have been organized through the form of the People's Liberation Army to dedicate themselves to the cause of people's liberation. The People's Liberation Army is the highest form of organizing youth for struggle. Therefore, the Chinese People's Liberation Army is inseparable from the Chinese youth workers, youth farmers, and youth intellectuals. In the areas to be liberated, young people organized secret youth groups and revolutionary student unions in the manner of underground workers, fighting against the Kuomintang reactionaries in the form of anti-hunger and anti-civil war. Today, Chinese youth are facing the total emancipation of the people of the whole country. The New Democratic Youth League and various youth organizations are new organizational forms for organizing and leading the youth of the whole country. Its task is to unite the youth of the whole country, currently to support the Liberation War to completely eliminate the Kuomintang reactionaries and liberate all of China; the long-term task is to hold high the banner of the great leader Mao Zedong and engage in various constructions of the new China.

　　Mayor Chen emphasized: The Chinese youth movement is a part of the world youth movement and is inseparable from the international youth movement. In order to effectively strike at imperialism, the Chinese youth masses must participate in the torrent of the international youth movement. They should take the youth of the Soviet socialist countries as their teachers, participate in international youth organizations, and strive for the common interests of the youth masses of the world and the people of the world, defend world peace and democracy, and oppose warmongers. As long as the international youth unite, smash the imperialist war conspiracy, and defend the task of world democracy and peace, it will definitely be accomplished.

　　上海各界青年庆祝国际青年节大会上
  　陈毅市长讲话摘要
    【新华社上海五日电】陈毅市长于一日晚在上海市各界青年庆祝国际青年节大会上的讲话，摘要如下：
    陈市长首先代表中共上海市委、上海人民市政府、华东人民解放军向各界青年致革命的敬礼。他指出国际青年运动不单纯是知识青年运动，而是青年工人、青年农民、青年学生等各阶层青年的运动。国际青年节的产生是国际青年运动多年来的光辉斗争历史所获致的。
    陈市长追溯到国际青年运动的发生和发展，并举例说明中国青年运动在革命运动中的作用。他说：在十九世纪末年到二十世纪初年，世界资本主义发展进入帝国主义时代，迫害、压榨，即首先加诸各国青年工人头上。在平时逼使青年工人作过度的损害健康的劳动——替资本主义创造利润；在战时驱使青年替帝国主义打仗，美其名曰“爱国主义”。在殖民地和半殖民地中，反动的大资产阶级大地主阶级投靠帝国主义阵营，出卖国家民族利益，假借“民族至上”“国家至上”等口号驱使青年作反人民的事。可是，青年大众并不是好欺侮的，帝国主义及其走狗压迫青年的反动行为，必然招致青年大众的反抗，促进青年人的觉悟和团结。由于帝国主义扩展侵略势力冲破民族藩篱，超过国界，他们压迫青年也是不分国界的；所以世界各国的青年大众起来反对帝国主义及其走狗。也是突破国界，迅速转为国际青年的大团结，结成国际青年反帝的雄厚力量。各国青年大众在反帝国主义的斗争中常常站在最前列，为保护青年本身利益而奋斗，实际上就是为保护世界人民利益而奋斗。
    我们中国青年在革命运动中所起的作用，就是国际青年运动的一个最新鲜最生动的例子。因为帝国主义侵略中国和卖国贼出卖国家民族，这种深刻的矛盾，首先引起青年人的反抗，促使青年成为革命运动的先锋。从五四运动、五卅运动、北伐革命、抗日战争以及这次人民解放战争，中国青年都站在斗争的第一线，与帝国主义和国内反动统治作生死的决斗。近几年来，在老解放区就是通过人民解放军的形式，把工人、农民、知识分子强大的青年力量组织起来献身于人民解放事业。人民解放军就是组织青年进行斗争的最高形式。因此，中国人民解放军与中国青年工人、青年农民、青年知识分子分不开的。在待解放区，青年们以地下工作者方式组织秘密的青年团体和革命的学生会，以反饥饿反内战形式，与国民党反动派作斗争。今天中国青年面临全国人民的总翻身，新民主主义青年团和各种青年团体，就是组织和领导全国青年的新的组织形式。其任务为团结全国青年，在目前是支援解放战争彻底消灭国民党反动派，解放全中国；长远的任务就是高举伟大领袖毛泽东的旗帜，从事新中国各种建设。
    陈市长着重地说：中国青年运动是世界青年运动的一部分，是与国际青年运动分不开的。为了有效地打击帝国主义，中国青年大众必须参加到国际青年运动的洪流中去。应该以苏联社会主义国家的青年为师，参加国际青年组织，为世界青年大众，世界人民大众的共同利益而奋斗，保卫世界和平民主，反对战争贩子。只要国际青年团结起来，粉碎帝国主义的战争阴谋，保卫世界民主和平的任务，一定能够完成。
