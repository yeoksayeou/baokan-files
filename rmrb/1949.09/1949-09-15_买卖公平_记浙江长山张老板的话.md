　　"Fair Trade"
    ——From the words of Boss Zhang of Changshan, Zhejiang

    Before the liberation of Changshan, one day a Kuomintang (KMT) officer came to me with a fake silver dollar wanting to buy two packs of cigarettes. I said, "This is copper, we can't spend it." That KMT officer got angry and cursed, "Damn it, what copper? Chairman Chiang Kai-shek gave this to me, and no one in the world dares to refuse it! Copper, you still have to sell it!"

    I was so scared that I quickly apologized and said, "It doesn't matter if the officer doesn't give me money, just take them and smoke them." Hearing this, he pretended to be even angrier: "Hmph, I always believe in fair trade, who would smoke your cigarettes for free?"

    I had no choice but to sell them to him. But based on the silver dollar rate, he owed me 500,000 yuan in change. That guy picked up the two packs of cigarettes and said again: "What else do you have to say? Hurry up and give me the change!"

    Sigh, this was simply robbery! I didn't dare to say a word and had to accept the loss and give him 500,000 yuan.

　　“买卖公平”
    ——记浙江长山张老板的话
    在常山未解放以前，一天有一个蒋匪军官，拿着一个假银元要向我买两条纸烟。我说：“这是铜的，我们花不出去”。那蒋匪军官就生气了，骂道：“他妈，什么铜的，蒋委员长发给老子就是这个，走遍天下谁敢不要？铜的，铜的也得卖！”
    我吓的连忙赔不是说：“长官不给我钱也没关系，随便拿上抽去吧。”这一说，他可装得更生气了：“哼，老子向来买卖公平，谁白抽你的纸烟？”
    我无法只好卖给他。但按银元说得找他五十万块钱。那家伙拿起两条烟来，又开口说：“你还有什么话可说，赶快找钱！”
    咳，这简直是土匪啊！我没敢吭一吭，只好自认吃亏，找了他五十万块钱。
