　　It has a very profound impact on the revolutionary struggles of the entire Asian people. It greatly encourages the Asian people in their struggle for independence, democracy, and peace. It is also a powerful support for the struggles of the people of Europe and the United States. The Vietnamese people's national liberation war has achieved many successes. Their current task is to consolidate the achievements and completely overthrow imperialist rule in Vietnam. Since the establishment of the Joint Command of the People's Democratic Allied Forces by the various guerrilla teams in Burma this spring, the national liberation war has also gained new development. The liberated areas are expanding day by day, already possessing 50,000 square miles of territory. In addition, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is growing stronger day by day. The Workers' Party has gradually taken root and blossomed among the people, the national united front is greatly expanding, and the guerrilla war of the South Korean people against U.S. imperialism and the Syngman Rhee puppet government is raging like a prairie fire. The armed struggles for independence and freedom waged by the people of Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaya, and other countries are also continuing to be persisted in and expanded. All the facts prove that the Asian people are carrying out their struggles on a grand scale and with mighty strides, coordinating with the European people's democratic movement to strike at the foundations of imperialist rule.

　　The international united front for the defense of peace throughout the world, under the leadership of the Soviet Union, is becoming wider and more extensive. Compared with last year, it is now more organized and has a greater mass base. The World Congress of Supporters of Peace, held simultaneously in Paris and Prague from April 20 to 25 this year, united 800 million people from all over the world around the opposition to war and the defense of peace. I represented the Chinese press at the Prague Congress, and I personally experienced the unparalleled power of the world's peace-loving forces. As representatives of hundreds of millions of people, although they have different skin colors, different nationalities, different political and religious beliefs, and although they speak different languages, they have the same thoughts and wishes. They uttered the same cry from different languages: We don't want war, we want peace! Since the World Congress of Supporters of Peace established a permanent body as a unified leading organ for defending world peace and closed, the great movement to defend peace has become more developed and stronger. The Soviet Union held the All-Union Congress of Peace Supporters. Peace committees have been established in the United States, Italy, Britain, Canada, Germany, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Romania, Hungary, Finland, Greece, and many other countries. The Pan-American Peace Congress is being held on the American continent, which is tightly controlled by U.S. imperialism. India, Japan, and other countries are also holding regular peace congresses, uniting more and more people into the ranks of peace. The three major international organizations striving for peace, democracy, and the right to survival are also becoming increasingly consolidated and stronger, becoming powerful pillars of the international peace united front. The World Federation of Trade Unions has now united 67 million organized workers in 52 countries. In the four years of arduous struggle since its establishment, it has shattered the splitting and destructive activities of the reactionary leaders of trade unions in the United States and Britain. In June this year, the World Federation of Trade Unions held its second congress, marking the great unity of the world's working class. The resolutions and declarations passed at the congress further called on the working people of the world to unite and fight for the widespread development of defending peace and defending the rights of workers. In the four years since the first congress of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, the number of members has increased from 30 million to more than 60 million today. The just-concluded International Youth and Students' Festival, the Second International Youth Congress, fully demonstrated that the world's democratic youth have become even more united in the cause of fighting for peace, democracy, independence, and a better future for youth. The International Democratic Women's Federation, which has more than 80 million members, is leading women all over the world to actively participate in the struggle for peace. The world's broad masses of people's desire for peace and the ever-growing and tremendous solidarity for peace are the main guarantees for overcoming the danger of war, and a shackle that binds the hands and feet of the war provocateurs, preventing them from acting rashly.

　　The situation in the imperialist camp is exactly the opposite of that in the people's democratic camp. The imperialist countries are facing increasingly serious economic difficulties and crises, as well as mutual infighting caused by them. In the past year, the strength of the imperialist camp has not increased, but has weakened. The war plans of the war provocateurs are not only seriously opposed by the people of the world, but also encounter resistance from internal difficulties and contradictions.

　　A year ago, when the Marshall Plan was just implemented, the reactionaries in Western European countries, who were mired in economic difficulties, once held such ardent hopes that they could be saved by relying on this so-called Marshall Plan to "revive" Western Europe. But in no time, hope gradually shattered. This Marshall Plan, which was not intended to save Western European countries, but to save the U.S. economic crisis at the expense and enslavement of Western European countries, has made Western European countries sink deeper and deeper into the mire of economic crisis. Although Western European countries received more than 6 billion U.S. dollars in "Marshall Plan" aid in the past year, most of these 6 billion U.S. dollars were agricultural products and daily necessities, including a large number of lipsticks, chewing gum, and chocolates, and machines that truly contributed to economic recovery accounted for only 3 percent. This, of course, did not help to solve the post-war economic difficulties of Western European countries; on the contrary, Western European countries are suffocating under the pressure of these "aid" and are facing serious crises such as sluggish product sales, declining production, mass unemployment, and increasing U.S. dollar deficits. Italian industrial production in April this year fell by 20 percent compared with the same period last year, and the French economy is also paralyzed. Particularly difficult is Britain, whose economic difficulties are sharply manifested in the dollar crisis. In the second quarter of this year, Britain's dollar deficit reached a huge 157 million pounds. The increasing severity of these economic difficulties has made the rule of the reactionaries in Western European countries increasingly riddled with holes.

　　U.S. imperialism itself has also begun to encounter an increasingly serious economic crisis. The Marshall Plan was once a way for U.S. imperialism to escape the economic crisis. This "plan" did delay the arrival of the U.S. economic crisis to some extent, but after all, U.S. imperialism, even with its great abilities, cannot change the laws of capitalist development. U.S. industrial production has been declining since December last year, and by June this year it had fallen by 13 percent, of which machine production fell by 20 percent. The number of unemployed and semi-unemployed people has exceeded 10 million. It can be predicted that the economic crisis will bring devastating disasters to the United States.

　　The economic crisis in the capitalist world has intensified the contradictions between imperialists and the contradictions within imperialist countries. U.S. imperialism attempted to use empty threats to intimidate the Soviet Union and the new democratic countries of Eastern Europe to "open their doors" to it, but it failed; it attempted to conquer the Chinese people with airplanes and artillery and turn China into a colony, but it also failed. U.S. imperialism has also turned its knife on capitalist countries and their colonial vassal states. It attempts to expand to these countries, seize their markets, and find a way out for its economic crisis. However, U.S. imperialism has also encountered resistance here. The struggle between British and American capital in the Middle East, India, and Latin America is particularly serious. The contradictions and disputes between the United States and Britain, the two major imperialists, over how to solve their respective economic crises were particularly acute at the recent Washington U.S.-British-Canadian financial conference. This has weakened the strength of the imperialist camp. Similarly, within the U.S. imperialists, differences of opinion have become more pronounced due to the fact that the expansion policy has been thwarted everywhere and the economic crisis has already begun. Recently, the U.S. ruling group has also launched a dispute over the methods of its foreign aggressive policy, specifically manifested in the opposition of some Republican senators to the U.S. Senate's discussion and approval of the North Atlantic Treaty, the halving of the appropriation for the "Military Aid to Foreign Countries Act" in the House of Representatives, and the publication of the White Paper on China by the U.S. State Department. From the above analysis, it is not difficult for people to understand that the U.S. war provocateurs are not stronger than before, but weaker. Their position is more isolated, and the thin social foundation on which they rely for their new war policy is also shaking. The obstacles to their preparations for war are getting bigger and bigger.

　　The U.S. war provocateurs' superficial displays of ferocity do not show their strength, but reflect their weakness. What determines the direction of the development of the situation is by no means the arrogant ideas of these imperialist war provocateurs, but the power of the people. The peace-loving people's forces have surpassed the war provocateurs. As long as the peace-loving people are vigilant, strengthen the strength of the democratic camp, strengthen the friendship between the people's democratic countries and the friendship with the Soviet Union, and continue to unite and fight, the flimsy paper house of U.S. imperialism's preparations for war will surely be burned down by the fire of the people.

　　失败的命运在等待着战争挑拨者（续完）
    黄操良
    它对整个亚洲人民革命斗争有着极其深刻的影响。它大大鼓舞着亚洲人民为争取独立、民主、和平的斗争。它对欧美各国人民的斗争也是一个有力的声援。越南人民的民族解放战争已取得许多成就，目前他们的任务是在巩固已得的成就，并彻底推翻帝国主义在越南的统治。缅甸的各游击队自今春成立人民民主联军联合指挥部以来，民族解放战争也获得了新的发展，解放区正日益扩大，已拥有五万方英里的地区。此外，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国已经日益壮大，劳动党已逐渐在人民中生根开花，民族的统一战线正大大开展，南朝鲜人民反对美帝国主义和李承晚傀儡政府的游击战争正如火燎原。印尼、菲律宾、马来亚等人民为独立自由而进行的武装斗争，亦在继续坚持和扩大中。种种事实证明：亚洲人民正以壮阔的规模和威武的步伐开展斗争，配合着欧洲人民民主运动打击着帝国主义统治的基础。
    全世界保卫和平的国际统一战线，在苏联的领导之下，是愈来愈广泛和扩大，和去年比较，现在它更加具有组织性和群众性了。今年四月二十日至二十五日在巴黎和布拉格同时举行的世界拥护和平大会，把世界各国八万万人民，在反对战争和保卫和平的周围团结起来了。我曾代表中国新闻界出席了布拉格大会，我亲身体验到世界爱好和平的力量的无比强大。作为亿万人民的代表们，虽然他们有着不同的肤色、不同的民族、不同的政治和宗教信仰，虽然他们讲着不同的语言，但是，他们却有着相同的思想和愿望，他们从不同语言中发出了一个相同的呼声：我们不要战争，我们要和平呵！自世界拥护和平大会设立了常设机构作为保卫世界和平的统一领导机关而闭幕以后，保卫和平的大运动是更加发展、更加壮大了。苏联举行了全苏拥护和平者大会。美、意、英、加、德、捷、波、罗、匈、芬、希以及其他许多国家，都已成立了和平委员会。全美洲的和平大会正在美帝国主义紧紧控制着的美洲大陆召开，印度和日本诸国，也定期召开和平大会，正在把更多的人们团结到和平的行列中。争取和平、民主和生存权利的三大国际组织，亦日益巩固和壮大了，成为国际和平统一战线的强有力支柱，世界工人阶级联合会目前已团结了五十二国的六千七百万有组织的职工，它在成立以来四年的艰苦斗争中，粉碎了美英等国工会的反动头子的分裂和破坏活动。今年六月，世界工联召开了第二届代表大会，标志了全世界工人阶级的大团结，大会所通过的决议和宣言，进一步号召全世界劳动人民团结起来，为广泛地开展保卫和平，保卫职工权利而斗争。世界民主青年联盟自第一次代表大会以来的四年中，会员数目已从三千万增加到现在的六千多万。刚刚闭幕的国际青年与学生联欢大会，国际青年第二次代表大会，充分表现了世界民主青年已在为和平、民主、独立和青年美好将来而斗争的事业中，更进一步地团结起来了。拥有八千余万会员的国际民主妇女联盟，正领导全世界妇女积极参加到争取和平的斗争中。世界广大人民要求和平的愿望和争取和平的日益发展的巨大的团结力量，这是克服战争危险的主要保证，是一副束缚住战争挑拨者手脚而使它们不敢轻举妄动的枷锁。
    帝国主义阵营的情况恰与人民民主阵营的情况相反，帝国主义各国正面临日趋严重的经济困难与危机，以及因此而引起的互相倾轧。过去一年中，帝国主义阵营的力量不是增强，而是削弱了。战争挑拨者的战争计划不仅遭受到世界人民的严重反对，而且同时也遭受到其内部重重困难和矛盾的阻力。
    一年以前，当马歇尔计划刚刚实施之时，陷于经济困难的泥坑中的西欧各国的反动派，曾一度抱着那样热烈的希望，他们幻想依靠这个所谓“复兴”西欧的马歇尔计划，从此就可以得救了。但是曾几何时，希望逐渐破碎了。这个不是要拯救西欧各国，而是以牺牲和奴役西欧各国来挽救美国经济危机的马歇尔计划，使西欧各国在经济危机的泥坑中越陷越深。西欧各国在过去一年中虽然获得了六十余亿美元的“马歇尔计划”援助，但这六十余亿美元的大部分是农产品和日用品，包括大批的口红、口香糖、巧克力，真正有助于经济恢复的机器只占百分之三。这对西欧各国战后经济困难的解决，当然无所裨益；相反地西欧各国正为这些“援助”压得透不过气来，正面临产品滞销、生产衰落、大批失业以及美元亏空增大的严重危机。意大利工业生产今年四月比去年同期下跌了百分之二十，法国的经济也陷于瘫痪状态。特别困难的是英国，它的经济困难尖锐地表现在美元危机上，今年第二季英国美元亏空达一万五千七百万镑之巨。这些经济困难的日益加甚，使西欧各国反动派的统治越来越破绽百出。
    美帝国主义本身，也开始遭遇着日益严重的经济危机。“马歇尔计划”曾经是美帝国主义指望逃避经济危机的办法。这个“计划”的确曾或多或少地推迟了美国经济危机的到来，但归根到底美帝国主义纵有天大本事，也无法改变资本主义发展的规律。美国工业生产从去年十二月以后即一直下跌，至今年六月已下跌了百分之十三，其中机器生产下跌了百分之二十。失业与半失业的人数已超过一千万。可以预计，经济危机将为美国带来毁灭性的灾难。
    资本主义世界的经济危机，使帝国主义间的矛盾，和帝国主义国家内部的矛盾一齐紧张起来。美帝国主义企图用虚声恫吓苏联和东欧新民主国家向它“门户开放”，结果是失败了；它企图用飞机大炮征服中国人民，变中国为殖民地，结果也失败了。美帝国主义又向各资本主义国家及其殖民地附庸国开刀，它企图向这些国家扩张，夺取这些国家的市场，以为它的经济危机找寻出路。但是，这里美帝国主义也遭受到反抗。英美资本在中东、印度、拉丁美洲的争夺战，表现得特别严重。美国和英国这两个主要的帝国主义，为解脱各自的经济危机而发生的矛盾和争吵，在这次华盛顿美英加三国金融会议上表现得特别尖锐。这就削弱了帝国主义阵营的力量。同样的，在美帝国主义者内部，意见的分歧也由于扩张政策既到处碰壁，经济危机又已经开始而更形显著。最近美国统治集团内部在对外侵略政策的方法上也展开了争吵，具体地表现在美国参院在讨论批准北大西洋公约时遭受一部分共和党参议员的反对，“军事援外法案”拨款在众院中被削减了一半，以及美国国务院发表对中国问题的白皮书等等方面。从以上的分析中，人们不难了解：美国战争挑拨者比前不是更强了，而是更弱了，它们的地位是更加孤立了，它们所奉行的新战争政策，所依靠的一层薄薄的社会基础，也在动摇了。它们备战的阻碍是越来越大了。
    美国战争挑拨者表面上张牙舞爪，并不足显示他们的强大，而正反映出他们的虚弱。决定形势发展方向的，决不是这些帝国主义战争挑拨者的狂妄念头，而是人民的力量。爱好和平的人民力量已经超过战争挑拨者。只要爱好和平的人民提高警惕，加强民主阵营的力量，加强人民民主国家间的友谊及对苏联的友谊，继续团结奋斗，美国帝国主义准备战争的这座不坚牢的纸屋子，一定将被人民的大火烧毁。
