　　Entrusts Xinfeng Gongji Oil Press
　　To Supply the Needs of Ink Manufacturing and Other Industries

　　[This City News] Recently, the Ping City Trading Company's Oil Branch, in view of the extreme shortage of pure linseed oil (commonly known as flaxseed oil) for industrial use (such as manufacturing, printing, ink, paint, oilcloth, and other industries) on the market, resulting in procurement difficulties and affecting production, and on the other hand, considering that several larger oil presses in the city are operating at low capacity due to the off-season for raw materials, the company, in order to support them in a timely manner, has entrusted the Xinfeng and Gongji factories to process flaxseed into pure product (95% or more) to extract oil. The extracted pure oil will be supplied to various manufacturing factories to ensure that raw materials are not scarce, so as to achieve mass production. In the future, both public and private factories can contact the Oil Company for supply.

　　In addition, the company's Mineral Oil Department has recently added two types of oil: turbine oil and transformer oil.

　　平市油业分公司
  　托信丰公记榨油
  　供应制造油墨等业需要
    【本市讯】北平市贸易公司油业分公司最近鉴于市场上工业用的（如制造、印刷、油墨、油漆、油布等工业）纯亚麻油（俗称胡麻）异常缺乏，致采购困难，影响生产。另一方面又以本市几家较大的榨油厂，都因原料青黄不接，生产清淡，该公司为了及时加以扶植，现以胡麻籽加工做成净货（百分之九十五分以上）委托信丰、公记两厂榨油，以所榨纯油供给各制造厂家，使原料无虞匮乏，以便大量生产。以后无论公私厂家均可向油业公司接洽供应。
    又该公司矿物油部最近增添透平油及变压器油两种。
