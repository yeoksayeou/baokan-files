[Qingdao News] Qingdao's various industrial products are steadily supplied to the market and sold to rural areas. According to statistics from the Taxation Bureau, in the past two months, factories have sold 11,415 pieces and 116 pounds of cotton yarn, 6,250 kilograms of waste yarn, 15,126 boxes of matches, and 48,881,100 packs of cigarettes; among them, 90 percent of the matches were sold to rural areas. The sales of the above goods have been increasing month by month. For example, match sales in June were 2,949 boxes, and in July they reached 12,177 boxes. In addition to a large portion of its by-products (scrap iron) accumulated over three years being sold to rural areas, the Jianhua Ironworks has sold more than 20 tons of sheared silk and scrap iron to rural areas in the past two months. The Zhenhua Factory's pushcart heads (complete winch) have sold 1,355 sets (two per set) in the past two months, an increase of 62 percent compared to the sales in May before liberation. Due to the smooth flow of trade between urban and rural areas, the city's machine industry is repairing machines and preparing to start work. The Yongda Iron Factory, which has not been in operation for three years, has also begun to manufacture various vehicle parts. To meet the needs of rural areas, the factory is experimenting with water pumps.
