　　Traveling Companions
    By Soviet writer Panova, translated by Su Ling, proofread by Cao Jinghua
    Part One: Night
    Chapter Four: Yulia
    Peina was busy with her own affairs, thinking about her own concerns—she was standing in front of the dressing mirror embedded in the door, making a hat out of fine gauze. She glanced indifferently at the syringe that Yulia held out to her as evidence.
    "But why did you give her the syringe?"
    "She gave an injection to the electrical technician." His hemorrhoids were very painful.
    Doctor Suprunov ordered an injection of Pantapon.
    Peina frowned: she felt disgusted by this indecent disease. Just two days ago, she still thought the electrical technician Nievitsky was an interesting young man. But suddenly—sorry: he has hemorrhoids. Nievitsky no longer existed in her mind.
    "This train—it's simply a collection of old men and freaks," she said.
    But Yulia was developing her own topic:
    "I want you to believe that if a nurse forgets to put the needle plug into the injection needle, then she will never amount to anything."
    Peina finished making her hat, turned to Yulia with eyes full of fatigue. And then, as always, she thought about how painful the surgical nurse's recklessness was. How nauseating, poor thing!
    "You're too concerned about everything trivial," Peina said gently. "Cherish your nerves, we have many hard days ahead."
    Yulia raised her eyebrows. Actually, there were no eyebrows: only two swollen red arches with some stiff bristles like toothbrush hairs growing on them.
    "This is not a trivial matter. Don't you know that without a needle plug, the needle will rust?"
    "I know!" Peina replied with feminine, fervent sympathy. "But, dear, don't worry about it. Honestly, it's not worth it."
    The two toothbrush-like eyebrows rose even higher.
    "But who will worry about it? I should worry about it!"
    "She's getting nervous," Peina thought. The surge of enthusiasm passed, and she felt depressed.
    "Peina, I would be very grateful if you would criticize Smirnova on your side. If this continues, then we won't dare entrust her with anything in the dressing room."
    "Okay, I'll tell her," Peina replied with an angry look, and went out.
    "Wearing a hat to show off," Yulia determined precisely.
    Yulia was left alone. With a feeling of satisfaction, she looked around her bright and shiny little world. Everything was there, everything was arranged properly. Here are the orthopedic surgery instruments, here are the tracheotomy instruments. The sterilized gowns are in the closet. The sterilized towels are in the box. It's a bit narrow: when three people are together, it's impossible to turn around, but everything is at hand. Yulia was truly satisfied.
    It was truly farsighted. According to the situation, surgery is not performed on the train, only wound dressing. But look, all the instruments are available, nothing is forgotten. If necessary, any surgery can be performed, even sawing open the skull. Yes, this is where one can work. It's really pleasant to work here! The political commissar is a good comrade, and the doctors are all kind, especially Suprunov.
    Yulia fell in love with Suprunov.
    She was always able to fall in love with someone. As soon as she arrived in a new environment, she looked around and noted in her heart: "I love this person." And then she fell in love right away.
    In the municipal hospital, she fell in love with Professor Skoretsky, and she worked with him for fourteen years. She watched him gradually grow old, watched him receive two medals, watched him start and complete a book on cancer, and suffer from Malta fever, which he later recovered from—but she was always in love with him.
    Three or four times, she was unfaithful to the professor because of young assistants. But the old feelings prevailed, and she returned to him, blaming herself for her frivolity.
    He never suspected any of this. Nor did the assistants. No one regarded Yulia as a woman, and if Professor S. knew she loved him, he would be stunned. No one had ever talked to her about intimate matters.
    Only once did the professor say to her:
    "It's good that you haven't married." (No one had told him this—it was naturally obvious.)
    Her heart stopped beating. (Although she knew he was already married, and not long ago he had celebrated his silver wedding anniversary, and had grandchildren.)
    "Why?" she asked.
    "I can't work with a married nurse," he replied. "The surgical nurse should be completely dedicated to her work."
    That night, as she slowly walked home along the dark and silent garden, she repeated these short words in a low voice. She thought that for the sake of suffering humanity, she was willing to sacrifice her own life. No, not like that: for him, for Professor S., she gave up married life and motherhood. That's how bitterness and sweetness came. For him, for loving him...
    On the Finnish front, she fell in love with a military doctor from the brigade headquarters. But the Winter War was very short, so this love affair passed like a dream.
    On the ambulance train, for a time, Yulia's choice wavered between Danilov, the commander, and Suprunov.
    The first to be eliminated was Danilov.
    "Not refined enough," Yulia decided.
    The commander was in some ways the same as that unforgettable Professor S.: pale hair, swollen lower eyelids, and a pleasant voice.

    第一部　夜
    第四章　尤丽
    裴娜当时正忙着自己的事情，想着自己的心事——她站在嵌在门上的穿衣镜前面，用细纱布作着帽子。她不在意的把尤丽手里指给她作铁证的注射器看了一眼。
    “可是，你为什么把注射器给她呢？”
    “她给电气技师打针了。”他的痔疮痛得很厉害。
    苏普鲁戈夫医生吩咐叫注射一针潘塔磅。
    裴娜把眉头一皱：她对这种不体面的病厌恶起来。总共两天以前，她还觉得电气技师尼威茨基是一个够有趣的青年。而突然间——对不起：是害痔疮的呵。她的心目中再没有尼威茨基了。
    “这列火车——简直是老头子和畸形人的收藏所呵。”她说着。
    可是尤丽在发展着自己的话题：
    “我叫你想信吧，如果一个护士会忘记把针塞插到注射针里，那她永远不会有来头的。”
    裴娜把自己的帽子作好了，她两眼满含着倦意，对尤丽转过身来。于是就象从来似的，想到那外科护士的胡作乱为是多么痛恶呵。多么令人欲呕呵，可怜虫！
    “你对一切琐碎事都太操心了，”裴娜温柔的说。“珍重自己的神经吧，我们前途吃苦的日子多着呢。”
    尤丽把眉毛一扬。实际上，眉毛是没有的：只有两道发肿的红色的弓形，上边生着一些牙刷毛似的硬毛。
    “这不是琐事。难道你不知道没有针塞，针会生锈吗？”
    “我知道！”裴娜带着女性的热烈的同情回答着。“可是，亲爱的，你别操心吧。说实话，划不来的。”
    那两道牙刷似的眉毛扬得更高了。
    “可是谁会操心呢？我应该操心的！”
    “她发神经了，”裴娜想着。一阵热情过去了，她苦闷起来了。
    “裴娜，假如你从你方面责备斯密诺瓦一下的话，我就很感谢你的。假如这样继续下去的话，那么，我们裹伤室里连一件东西都不敢托付给她的。”
    “好吧，我告诉她，”裴娜已经带着生气的神色，回答着就出去了。
    “戴上帽子叫人看去了，”尤丽确切的断定着。
    剩下尤丽一个人了。她怀着满足的心情，对自己的光明发亮的小天地，环顾了一下。应有尽有，一切都安排得很妥当。这儿是骨科手术的器具，这儿是割气管用的器具。壁橱里是消过毒的衣罩。箱子里是消过毒的方巾。有点窄狭：三个人一起的时候，那就转不过身来，可是所有的东西都在手边呢。尤丽真是心满意足了。
    真是深谋远虑呵。照情况说来，火车里是不动手术的，只是裹伤。可是你瞧瞧吧，一切器具应有尽有，一件也没忘记。必要时，任何手术都可以施行的，甚至连锯脑盖骨都可以的。对的，这儿是可以工作的。这儿工作着真是痛快呵！政治委员是一个好同志，医生们也全是和蔼可亲的，尤其是苏普鲁戈夫。
    尤丽爱上苏普鲁戈夫了。
    她从来是会爱上什么人的。她一到了新环境里，向周围一望，心里就注意到：“我爱这一个人。”于是马上就爱起来了。
    在市立医院里，她爱上了斯科列斯基教授，她跟他工作了十四年。她眼看着他渐渐的变老，看着他得了两个勋章，看着他开始而且完成一部治癌病的著作，生了一场马尔他热病，后来治好了，——可是她总是在爱着他。
    有三四次，她因为年轻的助手而又不忠于教授了。可是旧的情感战胜了，于是她又回到他那儿，责备着自己的轻薄。
    他对这些一点也不怀疑。助手们也是如此。没有人把尤丽看成是一个妇女，如果斯教授晓得她爱他的话，他一定会吃惊得呆若木鸡呢。从来没有一个人和她谈过亲昵的问题呢。
    只是教授有一次对她说：
    “好在你没有出嫁。”（没有人把这件事告诉过他——这是自然明白的事。）
    她的心都停止跳动了。（虽然她晓得他已经结婚了，不久以前他还庆祝过银婚，而且有孙子了。）
    “为什么呢？”她问道。
    “我不能同一位出嫁了的护士工作的，”他答道。“外科护士应该完全献身于工作呢。”
    这天晚上，她慢慢儿顺着漆黑而寂静的花园回家的时候，低声的重复着这短短的话语。她想为了受苦的人类，她愿牺牲了自己的生活。不，不是这样的：为了他，为了斯教授，她放弃了夫妻生活与母权。苦与甘就这样来的呵。为了他，为了爱他……
    在对芬兰作战的前线上，她爱上了一位旅部的军医。可是苏芬战争是为时很短的，所以这一段恋爱也就象梦似的过去了。
    在救护列车上，有一个时期，尤丽的选择，是动摇在达尼洛夫，司令，和苏普鲁戈夫之间的。
    第一个被淘汰的是达尼洛夫。
    “不够精细，”尤丽决定着。
    司令有些地方同那个难以忘怀的斯教授是一样的：苍白的头发，肿胀的下眼皮，悦耳中听的声音。　　　
  　　　（未完）
