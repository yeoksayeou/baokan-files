Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 18th. Shandong convened a provincial trade union work conference from the 1st to the 8th of this month. The main leaders of trade unions from various regions and relevant personnel from various production departments attended the meeting. The main content of the meeting was to convey and discuss the resolutions of the National Trade Union Work Conference and to deploy future work. After Li Lin, director of the Preparatory Committee of the Shandong Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, introduced the situation and resolutions of the National Trade Union Work Conference, the representatives, in connection with their own work in the past, conducted group discussions, focusing on reviewing the roots of closed-doorism, formalism, and paternalistic, coercive orders in trade union work. They clearly understood the nature of trade unions, membership qualifications, and conditions for joining the union. Finally, Li Lin made a summary. Li Lin pointed out that since the beginning of this year, Shandong has begun to attach importance to trade union work and has achieved some results. The main shortcomings and errors are serious closed-doorism. At present, the number of trade union members in Shandong only accounts for about 17% of the total number of 1.2 million workers in Shandong. Insufficient attention has been paid to the trade union work of shop assistants, handicraft workers, and workers in private enterprises. Secondly, there is serious bureaucracy in work style, paternalistic practices, and a lack of democratic style, which has created formalism in trade union organizations. The above two tendencies are interrelated, and their ideological root is a lack of trust in the working masses, believing that the working masses are backward and complicated; insufficient understanding of the trade union as a mass organization. In addition to the above main deviations, there is also a lack of clear guidelines in trade union work, and there is no recognition that developing production is a common task of the trade union and factory administration, resulting in a one-sided tendency to seek welfare for workers. At the same time, the factory administration has not effectively relied on the conscious basis of workers to develop production, resulting in a lack of coordination between trade union work and administrative work.

Li Lin pointed out: In order to implement the resolutions of the National Trade Union Work Conference, the future trade union work in Shandong should: 1. Develop members in a planned and step-by-step manner. In places where trade unions have been established, launch a wide-ranging membership recruitment campaign, and actively carry out the work of building the Communist Party and the Communist Youth League, and establish the core leadership role of the Communist Party. In places where trade unions (or preparatory committees) have not been established, representative meetings should also be convened quickly to establish trade union preparatory committees, and then organize workers in various industries. 2. The local CCP committees should quickly equip cadres at all levels of trade unions and train and promote worker cadres in large numbers. 3. In conjunction with the democratic movement, universally establish and reorganize factory management committees, unify the leadership of the Party, government, and trade unions, in order to carry out production and thrift campaigns, and achieve the goal of truly relying on workers to run the people's enterprises well. 4. We must earnestly implement labor insurance and organize employee welfare undertakings in a prepared and step-by-step manner. Regarding wage issues, all regions should conduct investigations and research and submit plans for implementation after approval.

Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 18th. At the Shandong Provincial Trade Union Work Conference, Kang Sheng, Secretary of the Shandong Branch of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Chairman of the Shandong Provincial People's Government, made an important speech on overcoming closed-doorism and bureaucratic tendencies in trade union work. He pointed out: In order to complete the task of basically organizing the working class in about a year, we must first overthrow closed-doorism. He analyzed in detail the reasons for the emergence of closed-doorism from an ideological and policy perspective. He said: The emergence of closed-doorism is first due to political distrust of the working class, confusing one's own class brothers with a very small number of special agents in the factory; at the same time, the nature of the trade union is not clearly understood, and the trade union organization is confused with the Party organization; it is not understood that the trade union is a mass organization of the working class, and should include advanced, intermediate, and even backward workers. Precisely because this is not understood, the conditions for workers to join the trade union are set too strictly and too high, and in the work of organizing workers, only attention is paid to public enterprises, and insufficient attention is paid to the organization of shop assistants, handicraft workers, and workers in private factories, thus sealing the door of the trade union tightly. Chairman Kang also pointed out that in order to implement the mass line in trade union work and overcome bureaucracy, it is necessary to correct the appointment system and implement the election system; establish a democratic system and oppose commandism; and implement everyone running the trade union, opposing individual monopolization. He pointed out that the Communist Party organization in the trade union is there to lead the work, not to monopolize it; but on the other hand, it is also necessary to prevent the laissez-faire tendency of not having leadership. He emphasized that the mass line is the correct line of trade union work, and the democratic style is the soul of trade union work, and this spirit must be well implemented.

　　贯彻全国工会工作会议决议
  　山东省召开工会工作会议         
    克服关门主义偏向
  　康生主席指示实行“大家办工会”
    【新华社济南十八日电】山东于本月一日至八日召开全省工会工作会议，到会各地工会主要负责人和各生产部门的有关人员。会议主要内容是传达和讨论全国工会工作会议的决议，并布置今后工作。在山东省总工会筹委会主任李林介绍全国工会工作会议情形及决议后，各代表即联系过去本身工作分组进行讨论，并着重地检讨了工会工作中的关门主义、形式主义以及包办代替、强迫命令等作风的根源，明确认识了工会性质、会员资格、入会条件等问题。最后由李林作总结。李林指出今年以来山东各地对工会工作已开始重视，并获得若干成绩。主要的缺点和错误是犯了严重的关门主义。现在山东工会会员数目仅占山东工人总数一百二十万人的百分之十七左右。店员与手工业工人及私营企业中的工会工作没有注意进行。其次，在作风上存在着严重的官僚主义，包办代替，缺乏民主的作风，造成了工会组织上的形式主义。以上两种偏向是互相联系的，其思想根源是不相信工人群众，认为工人群众落后、复杂；对工会是群众性的组织认识不足。除以上主要偏向外，工会工作中尚缺乏明确的方针，没有认识到发展生产是工会与工厂行政共同的任务，因而存在着片面地为工人谋福利的偏向。同时工厂行政方面，也没有切实地在依靠工人自觉基础上去发展生产，因而产生了工会工作与行政工作的不协调。
    李林指出：为了贯彻全国工会工作会议的决议，今后的山东工会工作应该：一、要有计划、有步骤、大量地发展会员。已建立工会的地方，要开展广泛的征收会员运动，并积极开展建设共产党、建设青年团工作，树立共产党的核心领导作用。在未建立工会（或筹委会）的地方，亦应迅速召开代表会议，成立工会筹委会，进而将各业职工组织起来。二、各地中共党委要迅速将各级工会干部配备起来，并要大量培养和提拔工人干部。三、结合民主运动，普遍地建立与整理工厂管理委员会，统一党、政工会的领导，以开展生产节约运动，达到真正依靠工人、办好人民企业的目的。四、要切实实行劳动保险，并有准备有步骤地举办职工福利事业。关于工资问题，各地应进行调查研究，提出方案经批准后执行。
    【新华社济南十八日电】在山东省工会工作会议上，中共中央山东分局书记兼山东省人民政府主席康生对克服工会工作中的关门主义和官僚主义偏向作了重要讲话。他指出：为完成一年左右把工人阶级基本上组织起来的任务，首先要打倒关门主义。他详细地从思想上与政策上分析了产生关门主义的原因。他说：关门主义的产生首先是由于政治上不信任工人阶级，把自己的阶级兄弟与工厂中极少数的特务分子混淆起来；同时对工会的性质认识不清，将工会组织与党的组织混同起来；不了解工会是工人阶级的群众组织，应该包括着工人中的先进的、中间的以至落后的工人。正因为不了解这点，所以对工人加入工会的条件定得过严过高，而且在组织工人的工作中，只注意了公营企业，对店员、手工业工人及私营工厂工人的组织便注意不够，这样一来，就把工会的大门封得严严的。康主席并指出，为了在工会工作中贯彻群众路线，克服官僚主义，必需纠正委派制度，实行选举制度；建立民主制度，反对命令主义；要实行大家办工会，反对个人包办。他指出工会中的共产党组织是去领导工作而不是去包办代替；但另一方面也要防止不要领导的放任自流的偏向。他着重指出，群众路线是工会工作的正确路线，民主作风是工会工作的灵魂，必须很好地贯彻这一精神。
