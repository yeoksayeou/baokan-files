　　Introduction to Suiyuan
　　Suiyuan is located in the western part of Southern Mongolia, bordering Chahar Province to the east, Shanxi and Shaanxi Provinces to the south, Ningxia Province to the west, and Mongolia to the north. The provincial capital is GuiSui. It has an area of 291,432 square kilometers and a population of over 2 million, of which Mongols account for one-thirteenth, averaging about seven people per square kilometer. Suiyuan's geographical area can be divided into three parts: 1. The Houtao south of the Yin Mountains is the center of population concentration in the province. 2. The area north of the Yin Mountains is grassland and desert, where Mongols graze. 3. The Ordos Plateau is also grassland and desert, a mixed agricultural and pastoral area. The Yellow River flows into the territory from the northeast of Ningxia and divides into two branches. The area between the two rivers is called Houtao. The area south of Houtao is called Qiantao, and the area west of the Yellow River in Ningxia is called Xitao. Together, they are called Hetao, which is an important agricultural area outside the Great Wall. The saying "The Yellow River has a hundred harms, but only enriches Hetao" refers to this. Water transport relies solely on the Yellow River as a waterway, which is navigable. Goods from Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai provinces are mostly loaded onto rafts and floated downstream to Baotou for transfer to the PingSui Railway. The PingSui Railway connects to Baotou, serving as the main route for Southern Mongolia's foreign transportation. The main highways connect west to Ningxia, north to Bailingmiao and Hasantu, and pass through the Ningxia grasslands to Dihua in Xinjiang. Bailingmiao also has a highway that connects north to Uliastai in Mongolia and east to Pangjiang in Chahar, linking with the Zhangku Highway.
　　Suiyuan is rich in oats, producing about five million shi annually, ranking first in the country. Flax and rapeseed are also major agricultural exports. Animal husbandry is a major industry, with cattle, horses, and sheep as the main livestock, followed by camels. Horses, like those in Chahar, are a source of military horses for our country. Animal products are mainly sheepskins and wool, exported via the PingSui Railway. Minerals are mainly coal and salt. The Bayan Obo in Maoming'an Banner of Ulanqab League has a large iron ore deposit with reserves of over 30 million tons. Important cities include: GuiSui, Jining, Bailingmiao, Baotou, and Fengzhen.

　　绥远介绍
    绥远位于漠南地方的西部，东界察哈尔省，南界山西、陕西二省，西界宁夏省，北界蒙古。省会设归绥。面积二十九万一千四百三十二方公里，人口二百余万，蒙人占十三分之一，平均每方公里约七人。绥远地理区域可分三部：一、阴山以南的后套，是该省人口聚居的中心。二、阴山以北是草原沙漠地，蒙人游牧之处。三、鄂尔多斯高原地也是草原沙漠，农牧混杂地。黄河由宁夏东北流入境内，分为二支，两河之间就叫后套。后套南之地称前套，黄河以西宁夏之地，称西套，合称河套，为塞外的重要农产区，所谓“黄河百害，唯富一套”，即指此。水运以黄河为唯一交通水道，可通航，甘、宁、青三省的货物，多装皮筏顺流而下，运到包头转平绥跟运出。铁路有平绥路可通至包头，为漠南对外交通之主路。主要公路西通宁夏，北通百灵庙、哈三图，穿过宁夏草地至新疆迪化。百灵庙还有公路，北通蒙古的乌里雅苏台，东通察哈尔的滂江和张库公路相联络。
    绥远盛产燕麦，年产约五百万石，居全国第一。又农产中的胡麻、菜子为输出大宗。畜牧为主要产业，家畜以牛、马、羊为主，骆驼次之，马和察哈尔同为我国军用马的来源。畜产品以羊皮、羊毛为大宗，由平绥路输出。矿产以煤盐为大宗。乌兰察布盟茂明安旗的白云鄂博有很大的铁矿，储量三千余万吨。重要城市有：归绥、集宁、百灵庙、包头、丰镇。
