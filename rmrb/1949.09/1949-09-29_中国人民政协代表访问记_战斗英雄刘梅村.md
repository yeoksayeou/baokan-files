　　A Visit with a Representative of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference
  　Combat Hero Liu Meicun
    Yang Yongping
    Combat hero Liu Meicun's name was announced on the presidium list on the first day of the CPPCC opening. This hero is easy to recognize, with particularly many medals on his chest.

    Yesterday (the 23rd), Liu Meicun took a photo with Chairman Mao. When I asked him after the meeting today, he was very happy.

    He said, "On the way from Jiangxi to Beijing, I was thinking that I would be satisfied if I could see Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu at this meeting. Who knew that after being here for less than a few days, Commander-in-Chief Zhu would treat us as guests and shake hands with all of us. I also saw Chairman Mao. I was sitting very close to him, and I watched him very carefully every day. Yesterday, during the ten-minute break in the middle of the meeting, I saw Chairman Mao in the courtyard. I looked at him, and he looked at me too. He smiled and walked towards me, reached out to shake my hand, and even took a photo with me. I really felt the greatest honor of my life. After I go back, I will use my gun to defend our government and defend our leader, Chairman Mao."

    Liu Meicun is the battalion political instructor of the Third Battalion of the 382nd Regiment of the 128th Division of the Fourth Field Army of the People's Liberation Army. He is a combat hero who has received one special merit, one major merit, and two minor merits, and also a model instructor who has been praised by the entire division. In 1940, in the seventh district of Boxing, Shandong, he led a local guerrilla force of twenty to forty people, persisting in the struggle behind enemy lines for more than two years. The enemy carried out countless encirclements and suppressions to eliminate him, but they gradually grew stronger and developed into a strong local armed force, opening up the Sanbian area. In 1944, he was sent to the ninth district of Guangrao to carry out work, organizing and mobilizing the masses to carry out rent reduction and interest reduction and to fight against local bullies. In 1945, during the conscription movement, he led 180 young people to join the main force. After joining the army, he became a deputy company commander. In September of the same year, he was wounded in the battle to annihilate more than 10,000 enemies in Shanghe City. After resting for less than half a month, he entered the Northeast with the troops before his injuries had healed. He went into battle at Shanhaiguan. He participated in every subsequent battle in the Northeast. He was wounded twice in the battle of Siping and classified as a second-class disabled soldier, but he did not stay in the hospital. He said, "I have deep feelings for the troops, and I don't want to leave the troops for a single day!"

    Comrade Liu Meicun has a very good combat style. He never hesitates to complete the tasks assigned to him by his superiors. No matter how difficult the task, he always overcomes difficulties to complete it. He is brave and mobile on the battlefield, and can combine battlefield command with political work. His bravery can often turn danger into safety. He can also endure the greatest hardships, lead by example, and integrate with the lives of the soldiers. In his leadership style, he can humbly promote democracy and give play to the collective strength.

    In the spring of 1946, when our army first liberated Changchun in the Northeast, he led a platoon and defeated an enemy battalion, capturing 128 enemies. In May of the same year, on the first day of our army's retreat from Siping, he led two platoons to cover the transfer of troops. The enemy encircled them with dozens of times their strength, but they calmly persisted for two hours, completing the task of covering the retreat. When our army went south of the Jiang (referring to the Songhua River) for the third time, he led a company without a company commander, deputy company commander, or deputy political instructor, just him as the political instructor, and completed the task of going south of the Jiang for the third time. The environment at that time was very difficult. The troops were concentrated to fight mobile warfare. The snow on the flat ground was knee-deep. There were airplanes during the day, so they needed to move at night. The climate was sometimes as cold as minus forty degrees. In order to annihilate the enemy in the movement, they marched at least eighty li every night. After the troops were concentrated, they sometimes could not find a place to live. The machine gun company he led was very cumbersome to move. Some soldiers fell seventy-one times in one night. Under these circumstances, he was able to lead by example. He didn't sleep on a kang (heated brick bed) once during the third march south of the Jiang. He wore broken straw shoes and saved the new ones for the soldiers who didn't have them. He also often helped the sick carry things during the march. After fighting all night at Gengjiawobao, they didn't get to eat. After dawn, the troops retreated. Everyone was very tired, and enemy planes were harassing them overhead. At this time, he helped the soldiers carry two large guns and also carried the oil burden of the administrative office, walking twenty li in one breath. His health was not good. Sometimes he had stomach problems and couldn't eat for several days. In order to take care of his health, his superiors once gave him a dozen catties of flour, but he gave it all to other sick soldiers. Their work was quite tiring, but they still ran back and forth during each march, taking care of the sick and grasping the mood of the troops. After stationing, he would first go to each class to urge everyone to wash their feet and help the sick treat their foot blisters. Once, the comrades of the third platoon surrounded him and insisted that the instructor wash his feet first. The youngest Xiao Luo said with emotion, "Even if I have blood blisters on my feet, I can't fall behind. I will follow even if I have to crawl!" During the second battle of Chengzijie, the troops made a long-distance raid, marching more than 140 li overnight without eating or sleeping all day. Twenty-four people in the entire company climbed over mountains and ridges barefoot without falling behind. Some were stabbed in the soles of their feet by tree thorns, pulled them out silently, and continued to chase, chasing the enemy for more than twenty li, routing them completely. The entire company captured more than sixty enemies, which increased his confidence in the troops. When summarizing the work of the third march south of the Jiang, he was selected as a model instructor and awarded a major merit.

    After the Chengzijie battle, the Third Company suffered heavy casualties and was supplemented with more than 100 new soldiers. In order to maintain the combat style of the Third Company, his superiors sent him to lead this unit. The task was very difficult, but he was determined to complete this glorious task. Not long after he arrived at the company, all the comrades had a very good impression of him and made the greatest determination to maintain and carry forward the glorious tradition of this company. During the first pursuit of the temporarily organized 21st Division in the summer offensive, the troops marched continuously for three days and nights without eating or sleeping. It rained every day, and twenty-four people in the entire company climbed over mountains and ridges barefoot without falling behind. Some were stabbed in the soles of their feet by tree thorns, pulled them out silently, and continued to chase, chasing the enemy for more than twenty li, routing them completely. The entire company captured more than sixty enemies, which increased his confidence in the troops.

    During the battle of Siping, he commanded the entire company to complete five difficult tasks in a row, defeating and annihilating two enemy battalions and one regiment, and capturing nearly 400 enemies.

    The first time they attacked the enemy's outer strongholds, the construction of the strongholds consisted of two houses forming a bunker complex, with a large kiln as the main bunker. It faced the river in the front and was naturally connected to the city in the back. The walls and bunkers supported each other, and the traffic trenches were interconnected. There were more than sixty bunkers of various sizes, defended by less than a battalion of enemies. That night, brother units attacked along the river three times without success, and the time had reached two o'clock in the morning. The superiors then assigned this task to the Third Company. He first looked at the terrain and saw that there was a sixty-meter open space between the outer stronghold and the wall that could be used for a sneak attack. He used sneak attack tactics and only slightly injured two people, resolving the battle in ten minutes, capturing fifty enemies alive. The entire company was awarded a major merit. The company did not rest or eat for a day and a night. At two o'clock in the morning, they were tasked with attacking the walls. The walls were seventeen or eighteen feet high, and the ditches were more than seven feet deep. Outside the walls was a large bunker that could support the walls, and there was another large bunker in the natural ditch next to the walls. The ditch had plum blossom stakes and hidden bunkers, and there was barbed wire outside the ditch. The company did not have heavy firepower to cover them when attacking the walls, only using their own light machine guns and two heavy machine guns to cover the charge. When the charge was launched, it was raining heavily. The enemy used high walls and deep ditches to form three layers of fire nets and three airplanes to help them fight and stop them from advancing, but they broke through the walls in half an hour, continuing to expand their results, and using a platoon to take down seventeen bunkers, capturing more than seventy enemies. That night, they continued to accept the combat mission of developing in depth, attacking Xiaobinglou and the Meteorological Observatory. These two small buildings formed a core fortification for the enemy, defended by a battalion of enemies. Before carrying out the mission, the entire company only organized three squads. As a result, they only suffered one minor injury, and three packs of explosives collapsed Xiaobinglou, occupying a corner of the enemy's core fortification. Continuing to attack inside, it was the enemy's command post, the Meteorological Observatory, which was stubbornly defended by nearly 300 enemies. They drilled into the heart of the area, sixty meters away from the Meteorological Observatory. At this time, the three squads suffered some casualties, and the machine gun bullets and grenades were used up. At this time, it was already dawn. The battalion ordered them to hold their ground, but they assured the battalion that they could take the position and resolve the enemy. Under the enemy's fierce artillery fire, they reorganized and opened a gap with a pack of explosives. With the cooperation of brother units, they completely annihilated the enemy, allowing the troops to continue to advance. The next afternoon, the company was tasked with attacking the enemy's military headquarters. The military headquarters was the enemy's last stronghold west of the railway, and also the strongest stronghold, with a bunker every ten meters or so. The enemy called it the most modern fortification, and it was defended by Chen Mingxin's personal guard regiment. After accepting the task, he commanded the third platoon and led a squad to open the gap, broke into the building, and engaged in hand-to-hand combat with the defenders. The enemy launched more than ten counterattacks, but they were all driven back. The assault team and he were all wounded. The three machine guns turned red. At this time, he dynamically put forward encouraging slogans: "We can advance an inch but not retreat an inch!" "Today is either the fish dies or the net breaks!" "We will never be annihilated by the enemy, we will fight to the end!" "We will coexist with the position!" He also organized light and wounded soldiers to resist. The gap was blocked by the enemy's firepower, and the follow-up troops could not get up. Under the enemy's continuous counterattacks, he was wounded twice and fell into a coma, but the dozen or so comrades under his command continued to stubbornly resist. They fought against dozens of times their number of enemies for four hours. Finally, the building was set on fire by brother units, and all the enemies were taken prisoner. When the fire was about to burn them, he was still shouting in a coma, "Keep an eye on them!" He was dragged down the building by lightly wounded comrades and taken to the transfer station before he woke up. After waking up, he ran back to the company from the regiment, wrapped his head, with one eye injured and unable to see, still leading the thirteen remaining members of the company to continue fighting to the east of the road, and persisted in the battle for two more days. In this battle, more than 80 members of the company made meritorious contributions, and he won the title of combat hero and the "Mao Zedong" Medal.

    This time when they went south, he was the battalion political instructor. During the forty-day march, the three companies of the battalion he led won the "Consolidate Unity and Discipline Model" banner, and he was awarded two more minor merits.

　　中国人民政协代表访问记
  　战斗英雄刘梅村
    杨永平
    战斗英雄刘梅村的名字，政协开幕第一天就公布在主席团名单里，这位英雄很好认，胸前奖章特别多。
    昨天（二十三日）刘梅村和毛主席一起照了像。今天散会后我去问他，他非常高兴。
    他说：“我从江西来北京的路上，心里就盘算，这次开会能看见毛主席和朱总司令就满足了。谁知来了不到几天，朱总司令就请我们的客，和我们都握了手。毛主席也看到了，我坐的地方离他很近，我每天都很留神的看他。昨天大会中间休息十分钟时，看见毛主席在院子里，我看他，他也看着我了，他笑嘻嘻的向我走来，伸出手来和我握手，还和我一起照了像。我真感到平生最大的光荣，我回去后要用枪杆来保卫我们的政府，保卫我们的领袖毛主席。”
    刘梅村是人民解放军第四野战军一二八师三八二团三营营教导员，曾立过一特功、一大功，两小功的战斗英雄，又是受过全师表扬的模范指导员。一九四○年他在山东博兴七区领导一支二十人到四十人的地方游击队，坚持敌后斗争两年多，敌人无数次的清剿想消灭他，但他们渐壮大发展成一支坚强的地方武装，开辟了三边地区。四四年他被派到广饶九区开辟工作，组织与发动群众进行减租减息和反恶霸斗争。四五年参军运动时，他带领一百八十个青年参加了主力部队，入伍后他就当了副连长。同年九月打商河城歼灭万余敌人战斗中他负伤了，休养不到半月，伤还没好随部队进入东北，到山海关就进入战斗。以后东北每次战役他都参加，打四平时他两次负伤打成二等残废都没住院，他说：“我对部队有浓厚的感情，我一天都不愿离开部队！”
    刘梅村同志有很好的战斗作风，上级交给他的任务从来不犹豫，无论怎样艰巨的任务没有一次不克服困难去完成。他在战场上勇敢机动，并能将战场指挥和政治工作相结合，他的英勇，常能转危为安，他个人又能忍受最大的艰苦，以身作则与战士生活打成一片，他在领导作风上能虚心发扬民主发挥集体力量。
    四六年春天东北我军第一次解放长春时，他带着一个班打垮了敌人一个营，俘敌一百二十八人。同年五月我军从四平撤退的第一天，他带着两个班掩护部队转移，敌人以几十倍的兵力迂回包围，但他们沉着的坚持了两个钟头，完成了掩护撤退的任务。我军三下江（指松花江）南时，他率领的一个连队，没有连长副连长也没有副指导员，就他一个指导员率领，完成三下江南的任务。当时环境非常艰苦，部队集中打运动战，平地的雪达到膝盖那么深，白天有飞机需要夜间行动，气候有时冷到零下四十度，为了在运动中歼灭敌人，每夜行军最少八十里，部队集中过了，有时住不上房子，他所率领的机炮连行动起来又非常笨重，有的战士一夜连跌七十一次跤。在这种情况下，他能够以身作则，在三下江南过程中自己没睡一次炕，自己穿破乌拉节省下新的给没乌拉的战士穿，还经常在行军中帮病号背东西。在耿家窝堡打了一夜仗，没吃上饭，天亮后部队往回撤，大家都非常疲劳，头上又有敌机骚扰，这时他帮助战士背着两支大枪，还挑着事务处的油担子，一气走了二十里路。他的身体并不好，有时犯了胃病，一连几天吃不进饭，上级为照顾他的身体，有一次发给他十几斤的面，但他都给别的病号吃了。他们工作相当累，但在每次行军时还是跑前跑后，照顾病号，掌握部队情绪，驻防后还先到各班督促大家洗脚，帮助病号治脚泡，有一次三排同志把他围住，一定叫指导员先洗脚，年纪最轻的小罗感动的说：“我就是脚上起血泡也不能掉队，爬着也要跟上！”二次打城子街时，部队远程奔袭一夜行军一百四十余里，一天没吃上饭，全连没有一个掉队的，完成了全歼敌人任务。总结三下江南工作时被选为模范指导员，记一大功。
    城子街战斗后，三连伤亡较大，补充了一百多个新战士，为了保持三连的战斗作风，上级派他去带这个部队，任务是非常艰巨，但他决心来完成这个光荣的任务。他到连队后不久全连同志对他有了很好的印象，下了最大决心，要保持和发扬这个连队的光荣传统。在夏季攻势第一次追歼暂二十一师时，部队三昼夜连续行军，没吃上饭也没睡上觉，天天下雨，全连有二十四人赤着脚爬山越岭也不掉队，有的被树扎子插到脚心拔出来一声不响仍继续追，一直追了二十余里，把敌人撵的溃不成军，全连俘敌六十余，这样他对部队更增加了信心。
    在打四平时，他在这次战斗中指挥全连连续完成五次艰巨任务，打垮与消灭了敌人两个营及一个团，俘敌将近四百。
    第一次打敌人的外围据点，该据点的构筑：有两座房子构成地堡群，其中有一大窑作大母堡，前临河，后有自然沟通进城里，围墙与碉堡互相依托，交通沟交互串连，大小地堡六十余，守备敌人不足一个营。当晚兄弟部队顺着河攻三次没攻下来时间已到了下二点，上级便将这个任务交给三连。他首先看了地形，看到外围据点与围墙间有六十米的开阔地可以偷袭，他用偷袭战术，只轻伤了两人在十分钟内解决了战斗，活捉了敌人五十个，全连被记一大功。该连一天一夜没休息，也没吃饭，下二点又接受攻打围墙的任务，围墙高一丈七八，沟深七尺余，围墙外边有一大地堡可与围墙互相策应，靠围墙自然沟里又有一个大地堡，沟里有梅花桩、暗堡，沟外有铁丝网，该连在攻围墙时没有重火器掩护，仅用自己的轻机枪和两挺重机枪掩护冲锋，发起冲锋时天下急雨，敌人以高墙深沟构成三层火网和三架飞机助战来阻止他们前进，但他们在半小时内突破了围墙，继续扩张战果，用一个班的兵力打下了十七个地堡，俘敌七十余。当夜他们又继续接受向纵深发展的战斗任务，进攻小青楼与气象台，这两座小楼敌人构成一个核心工事，守备敌人是一个营，在执行任务前，全连只组织了三个班，结果只用轻伤一人的代价，三包炸药炸垮了小青楼，占领了敌人核心工事的一个角。继续向里打，即是敌人的指挥所气象台，有将近三百余敌人固守顽抗，他们一直钻进离气象台六十米达的心脏地区，这时三个班有些伤亡，机枪子弹和手榴弹都打光了，这时天已放亮，营里叫他们坚守阵地，他们却向营里保证能拿下这个阵地解决敌人，他们在敌人猛烈炮火下重新调配了组织，用一包炸药炸开了缺口，在兄弟部队配合下全部歼灭了敌人，使部队得以继续前进。第二天的下午，该连又接受了打敌人军部的任务，军部是铁路西敌人最后的据点，也是最坚强的据点，十几米达一个地堡，敌人称为这是最现代化的工事，守敌是陈明信亲带的警卫团。他们接受任务后，他指挥着第三排，自己带着一个班掀开了缺口，突进了楼里，与守敌展开肉搏，敌人一连十几次反冲锋都被他们打回了，突击队与他都挂了彩，三挺机枪打红了筒子，这时他一方面机动的提出鼓动口号：“能前进一尺不能后退一寸！”“今天不是鱼死就是网破！”“我们决不会被敌人消灭，我们要和敌人拼到底！”“我们要与阵地共存亡！”又把轻彩号组织起来抵抗，缺口被敌人火力封锁住，后续部队上不来，在敌人不断的反扑下他又二次挂彩，昏迷不醒，但他指挥下的十几个同志仍继续顽抗，他们就这样与数十倍的敌人对战了四个钟头，最后楼房被兄弟部队打着了，敌人全当了俘虏，火快烧到他们的身边时，他在昏迷中仍喊：“要盯住！”他被轻伤同志拖下楼去，抬到转运所时才苏醒过来。苏醒过来后，他又从团里跑回连队，包着头，一只眼被打伤看不见了，仍率领全连仅剩的十三个人继续打到道东，又坚持了两天战斗。在这次战斗中该连八十余人立了功，他荣获战斗英雄称号和“毛泽东”奖章。
    这次南下时，他是营教导员了，在四十天行军中，他率领的一营人有三个连队得到“巩固团结纪律模范”奖旗，他又被记了两小功。
