One of them read: "September 3, 1939 – Total Mobilization for War; September 3, 1949 – Total Mobilization for Peace." Le Bertière, Chairman of the National Federation of Veterans and Former Prisoners of War, Vice Chairman Béland, and other speakers emphasized the increasing danger of a new war, particularly because of the ratification of the North Atlantic Treaty.
