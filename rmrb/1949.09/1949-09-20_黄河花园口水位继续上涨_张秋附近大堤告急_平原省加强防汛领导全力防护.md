    Pingyuan Province Strengthens Flood Control Leadership for All-Out Protection
    [Reported by this newspaper] The Pingyuan Province Yellow River Affairs Bureau telegraphed on the 17th: Since the Yellow River water entered the entire embankment and the area between the Linhuang embankment from Zaobaolou and Zhangzhuangkou, the water level has risen due to the connection of the two bodies of water. As of 9:00 AM on the 17th, the water level over the entire Shou Zhang embankment was 5.3 centimeters; Furthermore, at 5:00 AM on the same day, the flow rate at Huayuankou rose to 12,000 cubic meters per second, which will further raise the water level upon arrival. On the night of the 16th, the embankment below Zhangqiu collapsed, and two leaks appeared near the culvert, which have been plugged. Currently, the masses are being mobilized to gather engineering teams and materials to prepare to build temporary embankments with all their strength and firmly defend the main embankment. New risks continue to arise in the Linhuang embankment, and repairs are underway. In order to strengthen unified leadership and organize all-out protection of the Yellow River embankment and prevent the expansion of the disaster area, Pingyuan Province will, in addition to strictly supervising cadres at all levels to encourage the masses to bravely defend, establish the Pingyuan Province Yellow River Flood Control Headquarters, with Han Zhey, and Wang Huayun as the chief and deputy directors of the Flood Control Headquarters, and Liu Yanchun as the Political Commissar.

　　黄河花园口水位继续上涨
  　张秋附近大堤告急
    平原省加强防汛领导全力防护
    【本报讯】平原省黄河河务局十七日电称：黄水自枣包楼及张庄口门进入全堤与临黄堤之间，两水相连水位抬高，截至十七日九时寿张全堤出水五公寸三；又该日五时花园口流量涨至一万二千秒立方公尺，此水到后将继抬高。十六日夜，张秋以下堤岸坍塌，涵洞附近出两口漏洞，已经堵死。现正动员群众调集工程队与物料准备搭船全力加修子埝，固守金堤。临黄堤漏洞继续发生新险，正在抢修。平原省为加强一元化领导组织全力防护黄水堤岸，不使灾区扩大，除严格督促各级干部鼓舞群众英勇防守外，并即将建立平原省黄河防汛指挥部，以韩哲一、王化云为防汛总指挥部正副主任，刘晏春为政委。各专区建立分指挥部以专员为指挥长，修防处长为副指挥长，地委书记为政委，统一领导治黄工作。
