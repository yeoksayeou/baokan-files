　　Starting Bit by Bit: Some Experiences from Summer Work
    Li Si
    During the summer vacation, I participated in the summer worker education program.

    At first, I inevitably had fantasies, always feeling that serving the people was a big deal, and there should be some grand and enthusiastic displays. But in actual work, I realized that in order to cooperate with teaching, I had to first understand the workers' thoughts. Therefore, I had to go to those small factories, chat with the workers in the hot rooms, talk about family matters, teach songs...starting from these trivial, bit-by-bit tasks. These tasks were not grand or enthusiastic at all. Sometimes, I would think to myself: "How troublesome and trivial! It takes time, it would be better to read more theoretical books myself!" But then I thought, if I don't start bit by bit like this, it is impossible to do a good job in worker education. Then, wouldn't what I usually say about "serving the people" and "being a good student of Mao Zedong" be self-deceiving high-sounding words?....

    After such ideological struggles, I gradually realized that the work of building the country is indeed a great undertaking, but it is not a feat that can be seen all at once, but rather the silent, diligent, and enduring accumulation of many people. At the same time, the working spirit of some cadres also deeply educated me: to remove personal vanity and fantasy, to honestly and bit by bit get to work. A tall building is built from countless bricks.

    Some classmates, before participating in the work, very naively thought: "Now I can get close to the most revolutionary, most courageous, most thorough, and most selfless working class." Who knew that when they arrived at the factory, they saw that some female workers still permed their hair, were also vain, and petty, and their class consciousness was not high, so they could not help but be a little disappointed! The comrade in charge of the trade union gave us a very good answer to this point: Due to the complexity of the current working class composition, some come from landlords, farmers, and even many are Kuomintang members. Workers from peasant backgrounds often have narrow selfishness. As for workers with landlord or Kuomintang backgrounds, the backwardness or reactionary nature of their thinking is even more obvious. At the same time, we must pay attention to the impact of the Kuomintang's years of reactionary propaganda and education on the workers. Backward or reactionary ideas certainly cannot be swept away all at once, and ideological struggle is a long-term struggle process. Therefore, the work of educating workers in the future is a long-term, arduous, and important task.

    But, generally speaking, workers are honest, simple, and frank. And because they have personally experienced various oppressions, as long as class education is carried out, their class consciousness is easily awakened. For example, carpet industry workers said: "If we didn't work for him, wouldn't he (referring to the shopkeeper) still be a bachelor like us before? It's not enough to rely on a few dollars! Without us, what would they rely on to start their business?"

    On the day I left the factory, at the get-together, a worker said to me: "Comrade Li, you are going back to school, we have nothing else to say, but all of us are reluctant to let you go." I experienced the feeling of a worker-student family.

    Although the time was only a short month, the objective reality had a considerable impact and education on me. It gave me a further understanding of the working class and the concept of "serving the people." What I had learned in books before was only a general, abstract, and principled concept; specific and vivid knowledge was gained from practical work. Using theory to guide practical work, and using practical work to enrich theory, is the best method of learning and working.

### 一点一滴地干起　暑期工作的一点体验

　　一点一滴地干起　暑期工作的一点体验
    李思
    暑假里，我参加了暑期工人教育的工作。
    开初，不免还带着幻想，总觉得为人民服务是一件大事，应该有一些轰轰烈烈的表现。但到了实际工作中，才发觉为了配合教课，必得先了解工人们的思想情况，于是，就得下到那些小厂家去，在闷热的屋里，跟工人们聊天，谈家常，教歌子……从这些琐细的、点滴的工作着手。这些工作半点也不轰轰烈烈。有时候，自己就想：“多麻烦、琐碎！又化时间，还不如自己多看些理论书好呢！”但是既而又想到不这么一点一滴的做起，就不可能搞好工人教育的工作，那么，平常自己老说的“为人民服务”“做毛泽东的好学生”等等，岂不是自欺欺人的高调？……。
    经过这样的思想斗争，才逐渐地认为到建国的工作诚然是一件伟大的事业，但它并不是一下子就可以看得出来的丰功伟迹，而是许多人默默无闻的，辛勤艰忍的累积。同时，有些干部的工作精神，也深深地教育了我：要去掉个人的虚荣和幻想，要老老实实地，一点一滴地干起。一所大厦是无数的砖头堆砌成的。
    有些同学，在参加工作前，很天真的想着：“这下子可接近了那最革命，最勇敢，最彻底，最大公无私的工人阶级了。”谁知到了厂里，看见有的女工，还烫了发，也虚荣，也小器，阶级觉悟还不高，便不免有点失望！这一点，后来总工会负责同志给我们解答的很好：由于目前工人阶级成份的复杂，有的出身是地主、农民，甚至还有好多是国民党员。农民出身的工人，往往还带有狭隘的自私心。至于地主，国民党员成份的工人，思想的落后或反动，更是当然的事。同时，我们要注意到国民党多年的反动宣传和教育，对于工人们所造成的影响。落后的或反动的思想当然不可能一下子就扫除干净，思想斗争是一个长期斗争的过程，因此今后教育工人的工作，是一个长期艰辛而重要的工作。
    但，一般地讲来，工人是诚朴，坦率的。并且由于他们亲身经历过种种的压迫，只要一进行阶级教育，他们的阶级意识是易于觉醒的。譬如，地毯业工人就说：“要不是我们给他做工，他（指掌柜的）以前还不是跟我们一样，光棍儿一个？光靠几个钱还是不行呀！没有我们，他们凭什么起家？”
    离开工厂那天，在联欢会上，有一个工人对我说：“李同志，你要回校了，我们也没别的可说，只是我们大伙儿都舍不得你。”我体验到了工人学生一家人的感情。
    时间虽然只有短短的一个月，客观的实际对我的影响和教育却是相当大的。使我对工人阶级和“为人民服务”的观念有了进一步的认识。以前在书本上所了解的，只是一般的，抽象的，原则的概念；具体生动的知识，却是从实际工作中体会得来。用理论去指导实际工作，以实际工作来充实理论，这是最好的学习和工作的方法。
