The CCP Central Committee North China Bureau and the North China People's Government jointly issued the "Directive on Autumn Harvesting, Wheat Planting, Autumn Plowing, and Production for Disaster Relief" on September 1st. The full text is as follows:

I. This year, most areas of North China experienced spring drought, coupled with continuous disasters such as insects, frost, wind, frost, and hail, resulting in a poor summer wheat harvest and late planting of large fields. Since the beginning of summer, especially in the past two months, there has been continuous rain and flooding, causing significant losses to autumn crops in some areas, with particularly severe disasters in areas affected by typhoons. The enormous difficulties caused by this year's agricultural production must be overcome through hard work. We must do a good job in autumn harvesting to reduce losses, vigorously lead the autumn plowing and wheat planting work, promptly carry out production for disaster relief, and promote the movement for thrift and preparation against famine, in order to strive for increased production next year and reduce the impact of disasters. This should become the current urgent task for the entire North China region.

II. Regarding autumn harvesting: First, harvesting must be timely so as not to delay wheat planting and facilitate autumn plowing. In disaster areas, in particular, no grain should be left behind, preventing the abandonment of possible harvests due to fleeing the famine. Second, it is necessary to organize watching and protecting the crops based on the specific conditions and customs of each area, and in newly liberated areas, it is even more important to prevent sabotage by bandits and special agents. Do not be paralyzed. Third, in order to reduce crop diseases next year and increase production, field selection is the most guaranteed method and should be promoted among the masses as much as possible through education and deployment. All agricultural agency personnel must vigorously carry out demonstration and promotion work and collect excellent varieties.

III. The following issues should be focused on in wheat planting: First, in flood-stricken areas, we should seize the time to carry out dike repair and drainage work under leadership and with planning, to the extent possible under current conditions. Plant wheat on a large scale to shorten the famine period. Patiently persuade the masses, mediate disputes, and solve the urgent difficulties of the masses. We must be deeply vigilant against bureaucratic methods that rely on a single order, which will not only be ineffective but will also harm people. Wheat seeds are the biggest problem. In addition to relying mainly on mutual assistance and loans among the masses, cooperatives and trading companies should vigorously transfer, sell, or lend them, and must do so in a timely manner.

In non-flood-stricken areas, the main problem is resolving the contradiction between wheat planting and cotton planting. In order to supply textile raw materials, we must vigorously promote cotton planting. We have already broadly determined a cotton planting plan based on next year's cotton needs and geological and climatic conditions. Responsible comrades of the party and government leading organs in each province should personally and thoroughly convey and explain this to cadres and the broad masses. Economic departments must accurately control cotton prices, ensuring that the exchange rate for one catty of cotton is no lower than eight to ten catties of millet, and this must reach the hands of the farmers, making cotton planting profitable and enjoyable. At the same time, they should also provide planned adjustments of coarse grains and fuel to cotton-producing areas to eliminate the masses' concerns about eating and burning fuel. In specific arrangements, we must respect geological and climatic conditions and the opinions of farmers, ensuring voluntariness. Correct the past style of assigning tasks equally and forcing planting. Except in flood-stricken areas, where wheat should be planted on a large scale this year, cotton should not be kept for seeds in areas where the geology is suitable for wheat but not suitable for cotton. It is also not appropriate to promote wheat planting in areas where the geology is suitable for cotton but not suitable for wheat. In areas where the geology is suitable for both cotton and wheat, we should consider the shortage of cotton production and persuade the masses to keep more cotton seeds. In order to prevent the spread of jaundice, which has occurred for years, we must pay attention to the promotion of excellent varieties and the guidance of seed soaking and disinfection in this year's wheat planting.

IV. Regarding autumn plowing: Last year, under the circumstances of frequent war service and a shortage of rural labor, the area of autumn-plowed land in the entire region reached 74% of the arable land, and in some areas, such as Taihang, it reached 90%, and in Jizhong and Taiyue, it reached 80%. Then, under the conditions that war service has stopped this year, there is reason to demand that all autumn land, except for muddy land, be plowed once, and plowed even better. Autumn plowing can eliminate insect pests, improve the soil, increase fertilizer efficiency, and conserve moisture, which is beneficial to spring plowing and sowing next year. In view of the particularly serious insect pests in various places this year, we should do a better job in autumn plowing to prevent insect pests next year. In Jinnan and other places, the land that was plowed last year was easier to sow this year even in the event of a spring drought, indicating that autumn plowing has a great effect on drought resistance and sowing.

V. In order to complete the tasks of autumn plowing and wheat planting in a timely manner, it is necessary to: (1) Absorb and develop last year's successful experience, organize the masses, mobilize women to participate in agricultural production on a large scale, and start early to take care of the families of revolutionary martyrs, military personnel, and workers who are poor and have no labor force, and do a good job in harvesting and plowing on their behalf. Some drought-stricken areas (such as northern Henan and southern Hebei) should also do everything possible to strive to plant autumn wheat. For autumn plowing, we should propose "the plow does not stop until the ground freezes." (2) Further mobilize and organize the adjustment and use of labor and livestock power. It is particularly important to adjust from waterlogged areas to areas lacking labor and livestock power. Strictly adhere to the principles of voluntary association and equivalent exchange to solve the problems of mutual assistance between people and livestock and wage rates. We must take care of the interests of disaster-stricken people who work short-term jobs, and in particular, we must not neglect the interests of livestock-raising households in order to give better play to the role of livestock in plowing and preserving the livestock of disaster-stricken people. This will not only solve the difficulties in areas lacking labor and livestock power but also better integrate with production and disaster relief work. Many disaster-stricken people have been forced to sell their livestock, and various places should carry out planned adjustment and control of appropriate selling prices for livestock to avoid slaughtering livestock in disaster areas and increasing livestock in non-disaster areas, thereby increasing productivity.

VI. In areas where land reform will be implemented this winter and next spring, landlords and rich peasants will inevitably be lazy in cultivation, and some peasants will also be concerned about changes in land and will not be willing to actively produce. To this end, we should clearly put forward the policy of "whoever plants it harvests it and bears the burden" and "protect labor income" and deeply publicize and explain it. In the future, households that are allocated land should give appropriate compensation to the original tillers according to their labor and cultivation expenses. We should also tell the peasants about the land reform policy of "resolutely not infringing on the interests of middle peasants" and "leveling both ends without touching the middle" so that people can concentrate on autumn and winter production.

VII. This year's disasters are severe, and we should universally mobilize and strive to produce, save, and prepare for famine. In areas with better harvests, it is easy to be overlooked. We should educate them with the spirit of being closely related to disaster areas and getting rich. In disaster areas, we should immediately launch a production self-rescue movement and organize disaster-stricken people to engage in sideline production. Organize supply and marketing cooperatives to distribute loan grain or loans in a timely manner, and organize their use to truly use them for production. Organize disaster-stricken people to participate in flood prevention and dike repair, water conservancy projects, etc., and implement work-for-relief. Collect and store various substitute foods for surviving the famine.

This year's autumn harvest, autumn plowing, wheat planting, and production for disaster relief work are extremely arduous. No matter whether in disaster areas or non-disaster areas, party committees and governments at all levels and economic departments must closely combine, coordinate with various mass organizations, and under unified leadership, be able to divide responsibilities well, mobilize and organize forces, promote new heroism among the masses, lead the masses, and become a true mass production movement and a mass production self-rescue movement. As long as we can effectively overcome bureaucracy, under today's various favorable conditions that are far better than in the past, difficulties can certainly be overcome! September 1st

　　中共中央华北局、华北人民政府联合发布
  　关于秋收种麦秋耕及生产救灾工作指示
    【本报讯】中共中央华北局暨华北人民政府于九月一日联合发布“关于秋收种麦秋耕及生产救灾工作的指示”，全文如下：
    一、今年华北大部地区春旱，加之虫、冻、风、霜、雹各灾连续发生，夏麦歉收，大田晚种。入夏以来，特别是最近两个月，阴雨连绵，河洪泛滥，部分地区秋禾，又受重大损失，而台风波及地区，灾害尤重。这样造成的今年农业生产上的巨大困难，必须努力克服。要把秋收工作作好，以减少损失，并大力领导秋耕种麦工作，及时开展生产救灾，节约备荒运动，以争取明年增产减轻灾荒。这应成为华北全区当前的迫切任务。
    二、关于秋收工作：首先要收获及时，以不误种麦并便秋耕。在灾区尤应颗粒不遗，防止因逃荒而放弃可能的收获。其次需要根据各地具体情况与群众习惯，组织看秋、护秋，在新解放区更应防止匪特破坏。决不要麻痹。复次为减少来年作物病害，增加生产，进行田间选种，最有保证，应尽可能地向群众进行教育、布置。一切农事机关人员，要大力进行示范推广及收集优良品种的工作。
    三、关于种麦工作要着重解决以下问题：第一、在水灾区当前应尽条件可能，有领导地有计划地抓紧进行堵口排水工作。大量种麦以缩短灾荒。耐心地说服群众、调解纠纷，并解决群众的迫切困难问题。应该深深警惕，一纸命令的官僚主义办法，不仅无济于事，且将坏事害人。麦种是最大的问题，除基本上靠群众互助借贷以外，合作社和贸易公司要大力调运出卖或出贷，并须及时办好。
    在非水灾区，主要是解决种麦与植棉的矛盾问题。为了供给纺织原料，必须大力提倡种棉。我们业已根据明年棉花需要及地质气候等条件，大体确定植棉计划，各省党政领导机关负责同志应亲自动手在干部中与广大群众中深入传达解释。经济部门必需确实掌握棉价，作到兑换一斤棉花不低于八斤至十斤小米的标准，且须达到农民手中，使植棉有利，乐于种植。同时并有计划地给产棉区调剂粗粮和燃料，以消除群众吃烧顾虑。在具体布置上，必须依地质、气候条件，并尊重农民意见，作到自愿。纠正过去曾有过的平均分配任务，强迫种植的作风。除水灾区今年应大量种麦外，凡地质适于种麦不适宜种棉者，不应留种棉花。地质适于种棉不适宜种麦者，亦不宜提倡种麦。地质棉麦均适者，则应斟酌棉产缺少情况，说服群众，以多留种棉为宜。为了防除历年黄疸病害之蔓延，今年种麦，务要注意优良品种之推广与浸种消毒工作的指导。
    四、关于秋耕工作：去年在战勤频繁农村劳力缺少的情况下，全区秋耕地达可耕地百分之七十四，有些地区如太行达百分之九十，冀中、太岳达百分之八十。那末，在今年战勤停止的条件下，有理由要求除泥淖地外秋地普耕一遍，而且耕的要更好些。秋耕能消灭虫害，改良土壤，增加肥效，和保存水分，有利明年春耕下种。鉴于今年各地虫害特别严重，更应作好秋耕工作以防除明年虫害。冀南等地去年秋耕过之土地，今年虽遇春旱下种也较容易，说明秋耕对抗旱播种有很大作用。
    五、为了及时完成秋耕、种麦任务，必须：（一）吸收与发扬去年成功的经验，组织起来，大量发动妇女参加农业生产，并及早动手照顾贫苦无劳力的烈、军、工属，切实作好代收代耕工作。部分旱区（如豫北、冀南），也要尽一切可能争取种上秋麦。秋耕则应提出“地不冻，犁不停”。（二）要进一步动员与组织劳畜力的调剂使用，由积水区向缺劳畜力区调剂，尤为重要。严格地根据自愿结合及等价交换原则，以解决人畜互助及工价问题。要照顾打短工灾民的利益，特别要不忽视养牲口户的利益，以便更多地发挥畜力耕地和保存灾民牲口的作用。这样既可解决缺劳畜力地区的困难，同时也能更好地与生产救灾工作相结合。不少灾民已被迫出卖牲口，各地应有计划地进行调剂与掌握牲口的适当卖价，以避免灾区宰杀牲口，而增加非灾区牲畜，提高生产力。
    六、在今冬明春即将实行土地改革的地区，地主富农势将怠于耕作，某些农民也会顾虑变动土地而不肯积极生产。为此，应明确提出“谁种谁收谁负担”及“保护劳动所得”的政策，并深入宣传解释。将来分地户对原耕种人，应按其所出劳力及耕种费用，予以适当补偿。对农民更应告诉以“坚决不侵犯中农利益”、“中间不动两头平”的土改方针，使人们安心进行秋冬生产。
    七、今年灾荒严重，应普遍地动员努力生产，节约备荒。在收成较好地区，易被忽视，应以与灾区息息相关和发家致富的精神进行教育，在灾区立即开展生产自救运动，组织灾民副业生产。组织供销社及时地发放贷粮或贷款，并须组织其用途，以达真正用之于生产。组织灾民参加防洪堵口，兴修水利等工程，实行以工代赈。采集储存各种代用食品，以供渡荒。
    今年秋收、秋耕、种麦及生产救灾工作是异常艰巨的。无论灾区与非灾区各级党和政府、各经济部门，必须密切结合，协同各群众团体，在统一领导下而又能很好地分工负责，动员组织力量，发扬群众中的新英雄主义，带动群众，成为真正的群众生产运动，与群众的生产自救运动。只要我们能够切实克服官僚主义，在今天远胜过去之各种有利条件下，困难是必能克服的！　　　九月一日
