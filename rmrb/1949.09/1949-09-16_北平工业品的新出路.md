　　New Outlets for Peiping Industrial Products
    Feng Zhong
    After a half-month of surveying in Chahar and Suiyuan, the Peiping Industrial Visiting Group more deeply realized that industrial production must be oriented towards the countryside. Farmers need a large number of agricultural tools, but farmers cannot accept complex machines such as tractors for the time being. Conversely, if farmers are still supplied with outdated and backward agricultural tools, agricultural production will continue to stagnate to a certain extent. Therefore, it is necessary to manufacture agricultural tools that farmers can accept and that can improve on the current basis, that is, relatively simple mechanical agricultural tools operated manually. What kind of daily necessities do farmers need? The Industrial Visiting Group came to the same conclusion in Zhangjiakou, Datong, and Fengzhen: sturdy and durable, simple, inexpensive, and with trademarks. Only bright and beautiful ones do not suit the taste of farmers. The silk and cloth industry in Zhangjiakou told the Industrial Visiting Group that the woolen cloth, striped cloth, and lining cloth produced in Peiping are all marketable. According to sales figures, the silk and department store industry in Datong also put forward five suggestions for the cloth woven in Peiping: (1) The striped cloth face is slightly narrower; (2) The color should be light, not bright red or purple; (3) Dark gray wide grids are the most popular; (4) Spun rayon can be used for the warp of woolen cloth; (5) Blended silk is the best seller. These opinions can be used as a reference for Peiping's weaving and dyeing industries. Enamelware is especially popular in the Northwest. A department store in Datong can sell 100 dozens of enamel rice bowls a day.
    In the past, farmers were constantly deceived by inferior goods and paid great attention to trademarks when buying things; they all liked to buy famous brands. Jinnan homespun cloth could not be sold at first because it had no brand. After sorting it out and naming it "Construction" brand, the farmers recognized it and bought "Construction" brand homespun cloth exclusively. Industrial products must guarantee certain specifications and quality, and after setting a trademark and creating a brand, they can be sold in large quantities for a long time.
    The purchasing power of the countryside after liberation is gradually increasing, gradually forming favorable conditions for trade between urban and rural areas. Taking Chahar Province as an example, in the past, the vast number of farmers were subjected to long-term oppression and exploitation by the Japanese invaders and the Kuomintang, and their productivity and purchasing power were very low; coupled with inconvenient transportation and excessive intermediate exploitation, the prices of industrial and agricultural products differed greatly. In the Chabei area, five big dippers (one dipper equals thirty catties) of naked oats could only be exchanged for a pair of cloth shoes, one egg for a thread, and five big stones plus one dipper of wheat could only be exchanged for a bolt of cloth. Therefore, even young women could not afford clothes, and an average of two or three households had only one pot, resulting in extremely abnormal supply and demand relationships. Although farmers owned grain, they were still unable to purchase the other living and production materials they needed. Also, because of the "surplus" of grain, it was worthless (it is estimated that Chabei still has 100 million catties of grain that have not been shipped out), which affected the farmers' production mood. After the complete liberation of Chahar Province, the abnormal situation is gradually improving. Trade companies have set up state-owned stores in major towns in Chabei to supply farmers with agricultural tools, cloth, cotton, and other necessities at reasonable ratios of industrial and agricultural products. On the other hand, they also absorb agricultural products. One big stone plus one dipper of wheat can be exchanged for a bolt of cloth. The farmers' response was very good, and they all said, "The large cooperative (referring to state-owned stores) is both kind and the goods are cheap. I have never bought such cheap cloth in my life." Recently, women in the Shangdu County area have already started wearing calico trousers and jackets. This is unprecedented in history. At present, the Chahar Provincial Government is vigorously solving the transportation problem. It is planned to ship out 500 million to 600 million catties of surplus grain and 7 million catties of mountain goods and medicinal materials within a year. At the same time, cooperatives, trade companies, and banks are all serving to restore and develop rural production. In the future, agricultural production will develop rapidly, and farmers' purchasing power will increase accordingly. Industrial products oriented towards the countryside will be guaranteed sales because they meet the urgent needs of farmers.
    The Industrial Visiting Group saw farmers buying goods everywhere in Datong. Although Datong was liberated not long ago, it has naturally become a distribution center for agricultural products from Yanbei, Jin-Sui, and Suidong and industrial products from large cities due to the rapid restoration of transportation. The nearby area is a grain-producing area, and agricultural products exchanged for industrial products account for two-thirds of Datong's daily transaction volume, making it a city with close ties to the countryside.
    Based on the above situation, it is not difficult for Peiping's industrial production to find sales outlets in the relatively backward Northwest, but it must be oriented towards the countryside and focus on the real needs of farmers for production. Fully utilize small and medium-sized cities such as Zhangjiakou and Datong as bridges to connect with the countryside.
    After returning from this survey, the Peiping Visiting Group, representatives of the weaving and dyeing industry are preparing to send samples of various cloths woven in Peiping to the silk and cloth industry associations in Zhangjiakou and Datong as a reference; Xinfu Iron Factory is preparing to transport the manufactured rice threshers to Xin'an and Zhuolu (where there are many rice fields) for farmers to test; Sanzhong Enamel Factory has ordered a batch of goods at low prices in Zhangjiakou and Datong to open up sales channels. The Chahar Provincial Bureau of Industry and Commerce and the Zhangjiakou Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce also stated that they can assist in the promotion of industrial products. Industrial products that are marketable in the Northwest (that is, industrial products needed by the countryside), as long as they have detailed instructions, can be taken to Zhangjiakou City for public exhibition at any time. Zhangjiakou City is willing to take care of and protect them on behalf of others, and promote them on their behalf.
    Peiping's industrial production has begun to find a direction for development.

　　北平工业品的新出路
    冯仲
    北平工业参观团在察绥考察了半月之后，更深地体会到：工业生产必须面向农村。农民需要大批的农具，但是，拖拉机等复杂的机械农民一时接受不了，反之，假如仍然供给农民旧式落后的农具，则农业生产将会继续停滞在一定的程度之内。所以，要制造农民能接受的，而又能在现在基础上提高一步的农具，即比较简单的用人工操纵的机械农具。农民需要日用品，但需要什么样子的呢？工业参观团在张家口，在大同，在丰镇得到了同一结论：坚固耐久，朴素，价廉而要有商标的。只是鲜艳漂亮的不合农民的口味。张家口的绸布业告诉工业参观团：北平生产的线呢条布、里子布都有销路。大同的绸布百货业根据销货情形也对北平织的布提出五项意见：（一）条布面子稍窄；（二）颜色要素淡，不要大红大紫；（三）深灰色宽格最受欢迎；（四）线呢经线可用批子线；（五）合丝呢最好销。这些意见都可作为北平织染等业的参考。搪瓷用品在西北尤受欢迎，大同的百货公司一天就能销一百打搪瓷饭碗。
    农民们过去曾不断的受劣等货的欺骗，买东西时对商标非常重视；都喜欢买名牌子货。冀南土布因为没有牌子，最初销不出去。经过整理，定名为“建设”牌，农民认清之后，都专买“建设”牌土布了。工业品必须要保证一定的规格与质量，定出商标，创出牌子后，就可以长期大量畅销。
    解放后的农村，购买力正逐步地提高，渐次形成城乡贸易的有利条件。就察哈尔省来说，过去广大农民在日寇及国民党长期压榨搜刮下，生产力与购买力很低；再加上交通运输不便，过重的中间剥削，工业品与农业品价格相差悬殊。在察北地区曾有过五大斗（一斗合三十斤）莜麦只换一双布鞋，一个鸡蛋换一条线，五大石另一斗小麦才能换到一匹布。因此甚至青年妇女都穿不上衣服，平均两三户才有一口锅，造成了极不正常的供求关系。农民虽拥有粮食，仍无力购置所需的其他生活资料与生产资料。又因为粮食的“过剩”，不值钱（估计察北仍有一亿斤粮食尚未运出），影响了农民生产情绪。察省全部解放以后，不正常的情形正逐步改善，贸易公司在察北各大城镇设立公营商店，以工、农业产品合理的比值供给农民农具、布匹、棉花等必需品。一面又吸收农业品，一大石另一斗小麦就可以换到一匹布了。农民反应非常好，都说“大合作社（指公营商店）又和气，东西又贱，有生以来没有买过这么便宜的布”。最近商都县一带妇女已有的穿上花洋布裤褂了，这是历史上仅见的事。目前察省府正大力解决运输问题。计划在一年内要运出五亿斤到六亿斤的剩余粮食，七百万斤山货药材。同时合作社、贸易公司、银行都为恢复与发展农村生产而服务。今后农业生产将迅速地发展，农民购买力随之提高，面向农村的工业品将因适合农民的迫切需要而保证了销路。
    工业参观团在大同到处看到熙攘购货的农民，大同虽解放不久，但因交通迅速恢复，很自然地成为雁北、晋绥、绥东等地区的农业品和大城市工业品的集散场所。附近是产粮区，农产品换工业品占大同每日交易数字的三分之二，成为与农村保持着密切联系的城市。
    根据以上情形，北平的工业生产在工业比较落后的西北找销路是不难的，但必须以农村为对象，抓紧农民真正的需要来进行生产。充分的利用张家口、大同等中小城市作为与农村联系的桥梁。
    这次北平参观团考察归来，织染业的代表准备把北平织出的各种布样子寄给张家口和大同的绸布业公会，作为参考；信孚铁工厂准备将制好的打稻机运到新保安、涿鹿（多稻田）试验给农民看；三中搪瓷工厂在张家口及大同都以廉价订出一批货物，借以打开销路。察省工商处和张家口市工商局并表示可以协助工业品的推销。凡在西北有销路的工业品（也就是农村需要的工业品），只要具有详细的说明，随时可以拿到张家口市公开展览，张市愿代为看管保护，并代为宣传。
    北平的工业生产，已开始找到一个发展的方向。
