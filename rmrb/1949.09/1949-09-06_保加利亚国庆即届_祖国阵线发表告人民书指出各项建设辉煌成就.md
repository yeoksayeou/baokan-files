　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 5th: According to TASS, Sofia, September 3rd: As the National Day approaches, the National Committee of the Bulgarian Fatherland Front issued a letter to all the people of Bulgaria. It stated: September 9th marks the fifth anniversary of Bulgarian National Day, and Bulgaria will hold celebrations under the conditions of the continuous growth of the world's forces for peace and democracy. On September 9, 1944, under the banner of the Fatherland Front, under the leadership of the Communist Party headed by the unforgettable leader and teacher Dimitrov, and with the resolute support of the invincible fraternal Soviet army, the Bulgarian laborers overthrew the royal fascist dictatorship and seized power. The friendship between our people and the Soviet people is the cornerstone of our foreign policy. Despite the cruel resistance of enemies at home and abroad, the Bulgarian people have implemented a number of great reforms that have transformed the entire country. Industry, mines, and banks have been nationalized. After the nationalization of industry, 5,552 industrial enterprises became the property of the people. As a result of land reform, 128,825 peasant households have acquired 150,000 hectares of land. The two-year national economic plan has been successfully completed, laying the foundation for the first five-year plan, and the plan for the first six months of the five-year plan has also been completed. Due to the implementation of special measures in Bulgaria, the living standards of the people have improved.

　　保加利亚国庆即届
  　祖国阵线发表告人民书指出各项建设辉煌成就
    【新华社北平五日电】据塔斯社索非亚三日讯：鉴于国庆日即将来临，保加利亚祖国阵线全国委员会特发表告保国全体人民书。内称：九月九日，是保加利亚国庆五周年纪念日，保国将在全世界和平与民主力量不断增长的条件下举行纪念。一九四四年九月九日，保加利亚劳动者在祖国阵线的旗帜下，在以难以忘却的领袖和导师季米特洛夫为首的共产党的领导下，在无敌的兄弟般的苏军的坚决支援下，推翻了保皇法西斯的独裁专政，夺取了政权。我国人民和苏联人民的友谊，是我们外交政策的基石。尽管有国内外敌人的残酷抵抗，但保加利亚人民群众却实行了若干巨大的改革，使整个国家面目一新。工业、矿山和银行已国有化。工业国有化之后，五千五百五十二个工业企业变成了人民的财产。土地改革的结果，十二万八千八百二十五户农民获得了十五万公顷的土地。两年国民经济计划业已胜利地完成，而给第一个五年计划准备了基础，而五年计划的头六个月计划也已完成。由于在保加利亚实行了特别的措施，人民的生活水平提高了。
