    In the local market quotations column on page 4 of the People's Daily, the interest rates listed include the People's Bank's current deposit interest rate of 3.6-4.2; and the commercial bank's current deposit interest rate of 21-24. But I don't know what the People's Bank's current deposit interest rate of 3.6-4.2 and the commercial bank's current deposit interest rate of 21-24 mean in terms of money. Please explain it to me.
