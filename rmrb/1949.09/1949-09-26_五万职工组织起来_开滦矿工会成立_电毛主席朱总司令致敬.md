　　[Report from our Tangshan Correspondent] The Kailuan Mine Trade Union, representing over 50,000 employees, was officially established on the 18th of this month. The conference opened on September 15th, with 198 representatives from the Linxi, Zhaogezhuang, Tangjiazhuang, and Tangshan mines, as well as the Majiagou Brick Factory affiliated with the mine, in attendance. The conference heard a report on the work conference of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, deeply studied the policy of benefiting both labor and capital, and summarized the work done in the nine months since the liberation of Tangshan. The entire mine has five branch unions, forty-seven sub-branches, and three thousand six hundred and twelve groups, with 44,542 members, accounting for 89.6 percent of the 49,836 employees of the four mines and one factory. The conference elected 31 official committee members, including Zhang Ping, and five alternate committee members on the 18th.

　　The Kailuan Mine is the birthplace of the workers' movement in North China. As early as 1922, the Kailuan Five Mines had a major strike lasting nearly a month, leaving a glorious page in the history of the Chinese workers' movement. Subsequently, there were several major strikes in 1929, 1933, and 1938, each demanding freedom to form trade unions, but this was never achieved. The major strike in 1938 even led to the famous Eastern Hebei Uprising, with many outstanding worker leaders and workers joining the great national War of Resistance Against Japan. Such a large and concentrated workers' organization is rare in the country. The establishment of the trade union is of great significance to the Kailuan Mine and the entire construction of Tangshan.

　　[Another report] After the establishment of the Kailuan Mine Trade Union, two resolutions were passed: (1) In the name of the representative meeting, send three telegrams to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu to express respect; support the leadership of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions; and support the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference to quickly establish the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China. (2) Recommend that the Tangshan All-Circles Representatives Conference quickly establish the Tangshan branch of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, and all representatives signed on the spot, willing to be the initiators of the branch.

　　五万职工组织起来
  　开滦矿工会成立
  　电毛主席朱总司令致敬
    【本报唐山讯】代表五万余职工的开滦矿工会，已于本月十八日宣告成立。此次大会开幕于九月十五日，出席者计有林西、赵各庄、唐家庄、唐山等四矿，及该矿所属马家沟砖厂之代表一百九十八人。大会听取了全国总工会工作会议的传达，深刻研究了劳资两利政策，并对唐山解放九个月来的工作做了总结。全矿已有五个分会，四十七个支会，三千六百十二个小组，会员四万四千五百四十二名，占四矿一厂四万九千八百三十六名职工的百分之八十九点六。大会于十八日选出章萍等三十一名正式委员，五名候补委员。
    开滦矿是北方工人运动的策源地，早在一九二二年开滦五矿就有坚持近月的大罢工，给中国职工运动史留下光辉灿烂的一页。随后又于一九二九年、一九三三年、一九三八年几次大罢工，每次罢工都有成立工会自由之要求，但始终未能实现。一九三八年的大罢工，更导演为有名的冀东大暴动，不少优秀的工人领袖及工人涌入了伟大的民族抗日战争。这样规模巨大而又集中的工人组织，在全国还不多见，工会的成立，对开滦矿，对整个唐山建设，都有着重大意义。
    【又讯】开滦矿工会成立后，随通过两项决议：（一）以代表会名义，发三个电报，向毛主席、朱总司令致敬；拥护全国总工会领导；拥护中国人民政治协商会议，迅速成立中华人民共和国中央政府。（二）建议唐山各界代表会，迅速成立中苏友好协会唐山分会，各代表并当场签名，愿做分会发起人。
