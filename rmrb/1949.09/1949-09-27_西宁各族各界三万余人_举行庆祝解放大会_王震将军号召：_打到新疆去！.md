Xinhua News Agency, Xining, 26th: Late News: The Xining City People of All Ethnic Groups and Circles Celebration of Xining Liberation was held on the morning of the 18th of this month.  Present were representatives of the People's Liberation Army city defense forces, including infantry, cavalry, and artillery, as well as workers, students, citizens, and representatives of the Hui, Tibetan, and Mongolian ethnic groups, totaling more than 30,000 people. The conference began amidst earth-shaking artillery salutes. First, General Wang Zhen spoke. He called on all ethnic groups to strengthen unity, strive to support the front lines, eliminate the remaining bandits as soon as possible, and liberate the entire Northwest. Finally, General Wang Zhen led all the soldiers and civilians in shouting: "Strike into Xinjiang, arrest war criminals and bring them to justice; unite all ethnic groups and build a new Qinghai!" Then, Zhang Zhongliang, Secretary of the Qinghai Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, He Bingyan, Commander of a certain army of the People's Liberation Army, Liao Han, Political Commissar, Xian Henghan, Director of the Military Control Commission, and Liu Feng, Mayor of Xining, spoke successively. In their speeches, they unanimously emphasized the need to thoroughly eliminate the remaining reactionary forces of the Ma Bufang bandit gang, eliminate the hatred between ethnic groups created by the Ma bandits in the past, unite and struggle to build a new Xining and a new Qinghai. Dian Mai, a representative of the 25 Tibetan tribes in Yushu County, southern Qinghai Province, said in his speech: "We, the representatives of the 25 tribes of Yushu, traveled 1,800 li to welcome the People's Liberation Army to rescue us." Ma Xiangchen, a Hui representative, said: "The fact that the People's Liberation Army implements ethnic equality and adheres to the freedom of religious belief has exposed the deceptive propaganda of the reactionaries who slander the People's Liberation Army for 'exterminating ethnic groups and religions.'" He expressed that the Hui people will resolutely support the Communist Party in the future. Guan Baojia, a Mongolian representative, said: "The reactionary rule and cruel oppression of the Ma Bufang bandits forced us to be displaced and unable to hold our heads high; the People's Liberation Army has brought us freedom and happiness." Finally, the conference passed a congratulatory telegram to Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, Deputy Commander-in-Chief Peng, and a congratulatory telegram to the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.

Xinhua News Agency, Xining, 26th: Before the liberation of Xining, Hui people from Linxia and Lanzhou formed two delegations to Xining to persuade the remnants of the Qing Ma army to surrender to the people. Now that the two delegations have completed their mission, they have left Qinghai and returned to their homes a few days ago. Before their departure, the Qinghai Provincial Military and Political Committee of the People's Liberation Army, the headquarters of the First Army, and the Xining Military Control Commission held a banquet to bid farewell to the two delegations. During the banquet, General Wang Zhen expressed his gratitude to the representatives for their enthusiastic assistance to the People's Liberation Army in eliminating the remaining bandit army of Ma Bufang, and for leading Zhao Sui, Deputy Commander of the 82nd Army of the Qing Ma Army, and others to surrender to the city. The two delegations also stated that the Hui policy of the Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army has won the enthusiastic support of the Hui people. The Hui compatriots of Gansu and Qinghai provinces wholeheartedly support the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party and are willing to unite closely with other ethnic groups to fight for the complete elimination of the Qing Ma bandit gang and the construction of a new democracy and a new China.
