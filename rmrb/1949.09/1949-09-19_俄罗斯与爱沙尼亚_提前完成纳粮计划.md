　　Russia and Estonia
  　Complete Grain Delivery Plan Ahead of Schedule
    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 18th: TASS, Moscow: The collective farms and state farms in the Kaliningrad Oblast of Russia, the Stalino and Zaporozhye Oblasts of Ukraine, the Kashka-Darya Oblast of Uzbekistan, and the entire country of Estonia have all completed the state grain delivery plan ahead of schedule.
    V.M. Saryev, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Estonian Soviet Republic, wrote in Izvestia on the 16th that the early completion of the grain delivery plan in Soviet Estonia is a great political and production victory for agricultural workers and the young Estonian collective farms. In the spring of this year, there were only 59 collective farms in Estonia, but now there are 2,975 collective farms. In fact, three-quarters of the farmers have switched from small, inefficient individual farming to large-scale socialist collective farming, and collective farmers have become the dominant force in the Estonian countryside. With the fraternal assistance of the various nationalities of the Soviet Union, Estonia's young collective farms and state farms, equipped with first-class technology from Soviet science, are growing stronger. This year, 15 more machine tractor stations will be added, bringing the total number of machine tractor stations in Estonia to 39. Self-propelled combines, compound threshing machines, grain cleaning machines and other types of machines have been adopted. The large-scale mechanization of agriculture and the increase in farming efficiency have made it possible for farmers to accelerate the completion of farmland work and shorten the harvesting and threshing time.

　　俄罗斯与爱沙尼亚
  　提前完成纳粮计划
    【新华社北平十八日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：俄罗斯的加里宁格勒州、乌克兰的斯大林诺和萨坡罗什州、乌兹别克的卡什卡——达利亚州、爱沙尼亚全国等地的集体农场和国营农场均已先期完成了国家纳粮计划。
    爱沙尼亚苏维埃共和国部长会议主席魏米尔十六日在消息报上撰文称：苏维埃爱沙尼亚纳粮计划的提前完成是农业工人和年青的爱沙尼亚集体农场的一个巨大的政治胜利和生产胜利。今年春季爱沙尼亚仅有五十九个集体农场，而现在却有了二千九百七十五个集体农场。实际上四分之三的农民，已从小的、效率低的个体耕作转入大规模的社会主义集体耕作，集体农民在爱沙尼亚农村中已占了优势。在苏联各民族的兄弟般的援助下，爱沙尼亚的装备有苏联科学的第一等技术的年青的集体农场和国营农场正在发展壮大。本年将增设十五个机器拖拉机站，爱沙尼亚的机器拖拉机站的总数将达到三十九个，并已采用自动推进联合机、复式打谷机、谷物清洁机和其他种类的机器，农业的大规模机械化和耕作效率的增加，使得农民有可能去加速完成农田的工作，并缩短收割和打谷的时间。
