　　Shanghai China Bank
  　Opens Export Loans
  　Stipulates Fourteen Types of Export Goods Eligible for Application
    [Shanghai News] In order to earn foreign exchange and assist export manufacturers in solving the difficulties of capital turnover, the Shanghai China Bank has begun to handle export loans for fourteen major export commodities such as tung oil, bristles, tea, raw silk, cotton textiles, feathers, straw hat bodies, miscellaneous grains, cotton, cotton yarn, cotton cloth, wheat, flour, and edible salt. With the exception of packing loans, which are still under negotiation, the bank has already opened export usance business a few days ago. On the day of opening, the Meilun Import and Export Company applied to export a batch of straw hats to North China for export, and the bank approved a loan of 5 million yuan. It is reported that any exporter whose goods are transshipped to North China for export abroad, and who has negotiated and obtained export documents, can apply for usance. The amount of usance loan is based on the estimated value of the export goods, and is approximately 60-70% of the value of the goods. The term is temporarily set at 15 days, and the usance interest rate is determined by reference to the People's Bank's usance interest rate and the market interest rate on the day of negotiation.
