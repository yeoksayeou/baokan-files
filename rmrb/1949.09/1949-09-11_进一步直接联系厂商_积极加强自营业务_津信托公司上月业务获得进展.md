    Tianjin Trust Company Achieves Progress in Business Last Month
    [Tianjin News] The business of Tianjin Trust Company has further developed in August. It has achieved considerable success in unifying public procurement and stabilizing the market.

    In August, the company further established relationships with various factories and importers, breaking the encirclement of middlemen and reducing exploitation. In this way, the company could purchase large quantities of frequently needed goods at prices lower than market prices. In terms of importing necessities, in addition to dealing with foreign trade companies, it also purchased directly from importers, reducing exploitation; for example, purchasing iron plates from Jingyuan Company at a price of 880,000 yuan per ton, which was more than 300,000 yuan lower than the market price, and saltpeter at only 750 yuan per pound, which was 160 yuan cheaper than the market price. On the other hand, 69 factories transacted with the company in August. The company's self-operated portion purchased finished products from factories amounting to more than 880 million yuan, including 100,000 hemp bags from Dongya, more than 20,000 bags of soda ash from Yongli, paper from Tianjin Pulp and Paper Company, etc. In addition, the goods promoted through the transaction room set up by the company were also considerable. In addition, it also supplied some factories with raw materials, such as phosphorus sulfide and saltpeter (imported) for the Zhonghua Match Factory, and picric acid (transferred from the Northeast) for the Weixin Chemical Factory and Gongyu Pigment Store.

    In order to ensure the successful completion of trust business, it is essential to strengthen self-operated business. Direct transactions with factories and importers enable the company to control a large number of major materials such as hemp bags, soda ash, base paper, kerosene, and lubricating oil. In August, the types of self-operated goods were more concentrated on important materials. In the procurement tasks completed for various agencies in that month, the self-operated portion accounted for 70%, which united various procurement departments in business operations and strengthened the connection with various procurement departments. At the same time, due to the strengthening of administrative management by the Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce, there have been few cases of agencies illegally purchasing on their own. In August, 367 units of procurement were completed for procurement departments in various regions. The procured materials included soda ash, caustic soda, base paper, iron plates, and hemp bags for North China, gauze, soda ash, and wool for the Northeast, hemp bags for Central China, corrugated iron, saltpeter, glass, and kerosene for East China, and lubricating oil for the Northwest, totaling more than 4.12 billion yuan (including self-operated sales and agency purchases), more than double the 1.77 billion yuan in July, and almost equal to the cumulative total of 4.6 billion yuan from the opening of business in February to the end of July (of course, the factor of price changes should be estimated again).

    Since the company can control most of the major materials, it can take the initiative in price control for other more scattered purchases, so merchants are not easy to hoard. Its sales of materials also have a considerable stabilizing effect on the market. For example, when the market price of iron plates was 660,000 yuan per ton, the company initially sold them for 520,000 yuan, and then for 480,000 yuan, causing the market price to fall to 520,000 yuan.

    As for the agencies coming to Tianjin for procurement in the past two months, most of them have brought materials for exchange. Among them, grain and cotton are handed over to the Municipal Grain Company and Cotton Yarn and Fabric Company respectively, and some materials are handed over to various departments or re-exported to Ping and Shanghai, and the rest are handed over to the Trust Company for consignment sales. In August, due to poor transportation in the Northeast, only 300 million yuan was sold on consignment, one-third less than last month, mainly including white sugar and timber from the Northeast, and natural alkali from Qinhuangdao. In addition, there were tung oil and sulfur from the Central Plains, and tung oil from Ji Luyu, which also played a certain role in promoting material exchanges between regions.

    The Trust Company provides various conveniences to private manufacturers who are legitimate. However, some merchants take advantage of the procurement departments' lack of understanding of market conditions and the quality of goods to directly win over procurement departments, and initially even conspire to bribe them, with the aim of buying at high prices in the future, tampering with quality, and evading donations and taxes. Such merchants who undermine the government's market management policies should attract the attention of administrative management departments.

　  积极加强自营业务
    津信托公司上月业务获得进展
    【天津讯】津市信托公司的业务在八月里有进一步的开展，在统一公营采购和稳定市场等方面，都获得了不少的成绩。
    八月份里，该公司进一步与各工厂和进口商建立关系，打破跑合的包围，减少了中间剥削，这样一面公司能以低于市价购入大批经常需要的货物。在进口必需品方面，除了与对外贸易公司往来外，并向进口商直接购买，减少了中间剥削；如购买靖元行的铁板，每吨价格八十八万元，比市价低三十多万，盐卜每磅只七百五十元，比市价便宜一百六十元。另一方面在八月份内与该公司成交的工厂有六十九家，只该公司自营部分购进工厂成品即达八亿八千多万元，其中如东亚的十万条麻袋，永利的二万多包碱面，天津纸浆造纸公司的纸等，其余通过该公司所设成交室推销的货物也很不少。此外还供给一部分工厂的原料，如供给中华火柴厂的硫化磷、盐卜（进口），维新化学厂和公裕颜料庄的苦黄（由东北调拨的）。
    为保证信托业务能很好的完成，加强自营业务是十分必要的，与工厂、进口商的直接成交使该公司自己掌握了大批主要物资如麻袋、碱面、盘纸、煤油和机油等。八月份自营货物种类更集中于重要物资，在该月替各机关完成的采购任务中，自营部分占百分之七十，这样就在业务经营上团结了各采购部门，密切了和各采购部门的联系。同时由于市工商局在行政管理上的加强，在外违法自行采购的机关已很少发现。八月里给各地区采购部门完成的采购共三百六十七个单位，采购物资包括华北区的碱面、火碱、盘纸、铁板、麻袋，东北的纱布、碱面、毛线，华中的麻袋，华东的瓦拢铁、盐卜、玻璃、煤油，西北的机油等，统计共四十一亿两千多万元（包括自营销货和代购），较七月份的十七亿七千余万元，增加到两倍多，几与自二月开业至七月底的累计数四十六亿元相等（当然物价变动的因素应再估计在内）。
    由于该公司能掌握大部的主要物资，其它较零星的采购在价格掌握上能够主动，故商人不易哄抬；其出售物资对市场还有相当的稳定作用。如在铁板行市每吨六十六万元时，该公司初售五十二万，继而售四十八万，致市价亦随之跌落到五十二万元。
    至于各机关来津采购者，近两月来，大部都运来物资作为交换，其中粮食、棉花分别交市粮食公司和花纱布公司，还有些物资交给各部门或转口平、沪，其余的交信托公司代销。八月份因东北交通不畅，故只代销三亿元，较上月减少三分之一，其中主要为东北来的白糖、木材，秦皇岛来的天然碱等，此外还有中原的桐油、硫磺，冀鲁豫的桐油等，对促进地区间物资交流，也起了一定作用。
    信托公司对私人厂商，凡属正派的厂商均予以各种便利。但有些商人利用购货部门对市场情况、货物质量的不甚了解，直接拉拢采购部门，初时甚至阴谋实行贿赂，其目的则在将来购大价和在质量上捣鬼和逃避捐税，对于这种破坏政府市场管理政策的商人，应引起行政管理部门的注意。
