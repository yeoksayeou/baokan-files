The North China Agricultural Department Cotton Production Improvement Office
　　Convenes Meeting on Cotton Collection and Purity Preservation
　　Mobilizes the Masses to Carefully Select Superior Varieties During the Cotton Harvest Season
　　[This newspaper dispatch] As the cotton harvest season approaches, the Cotton Production Improvement Office of the North China People's Government Agricultural Department convened a meeting on cotton collection and purity preservation in Ping (Beiping, now Beijing) on the 1st. Representatives from the Hebei Provincial Government Agricultural Department Cotton Production Improvement Office, the Hebei Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative, and the cotton ginning factories and Baoding Cotton Oil Factory from Shijiazhuang, Ba County, Linqing, Handan, Lixian, Tangshan, Tong County, Langfang, Nanyuan, and Yangliuqing attended, as well as representatives from the People's Bank. Vice Director Xi Fengzhou, in his opening remarks, pointed out: This is the first meeting on cotton collection and purity preservation in North China. Since the successive liberation of major cities across the country, in order to guarantee the supply needs of the machine textile industry, in addition to planting a large amount of cotton, it is also necessary to gradually improve the quality of cotton and produce more high-quality cotton with long fibers in order to meet the required standards. This is one of the important tasks in developing industry and transforming an agricultural country into an industrial country, and we must make great efforts to do it well. Although some work has been done this year to promote improved varieties, it is not enough to supply the large demand of the machine spinning industry. Next year, North China plans to complete the planting of one million mu of superior cotton varieties. Therefore, it is necessary to immediately carry out this work from now on. However, it should be noted that the promotion of improved varieties is a mass work. In addition to actively improving technology, our ginning factories must launch a mass selection movement. Only in this way can superior varieties be gradually and widely promoted. After Vice Director Xi finished speaking, the ginning factories in Shimen, Ba County, Linqing, Handan, and Lixian successively reported on their work. The meeting schedule is planned as follows: on the first and second days, the ginning factories from various regions will report on the situation; on the third day, Director Zhang Guangju of the Cotton Production Improvement Office will report; on the fourth, fifth, and sixth days, there will be group discussions; and on the seventh day, Vice Minister Zhang of the Ministry of Agriculture will report and conduct a meeting summary.

　　华北农业部棉产改进处
  　召开收花保纯会议
  　收棉时期发动群众精选优良品种
    【本报讯】棉花收获期将届，华北人民政府农业部棉产改进处特于一日在平召开收花保纯会议。出席有河北省政府农业厅棉产改进处、河北省供销总社，及石家庄、霸县、临清、邯郸、蠡县、唐山、通县、廊坊、南苑、杨柳青十地的轧花厂和保定棉油厂的代表，人民银行也有代表参加。主席席凤洲副处长在致开会词中指出：这是华北第一次的收花保纯会议。自全国各大城市相继解放后，为保证供给机器纺织工业的需要，除应大量植棉外，还必需逐步提高棉花的品质，多生产纤维长的好棉花，才能达到需要的标准。这是发展工业、变农业国为工业国的重要工作之一，必须用大力来把它作好。今年虽作了一些推广良种的工作，但因机器纺纱工业的需要量大，还不够供给，明年计划华北区要完成一百万亩优良棉花的种植。故必需从现在起立刻进行这一工作。但应注意，推广优良品种是一件群众性的工作，我们的轧花厂除要积极提高技术外，必须发起群众性的选种运动，只有这样，优良品种才能逐渐普遍推广。席副处长讲完后，石门、霸县、临清、邯郸、蠡县五地的轧花厂相继汇报工作。会议日程预定：第一、第二两日由各地轧花厂汇报情况，第三日由棉产改进处张广居处长报告，第四、第五、第六三日分小组讨论，第七日由农业部张副部长报告并进行会议总结。
