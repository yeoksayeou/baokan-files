　　Pingjin Communications Bank
  　To Collect Railway Transportation Fees
  　Trial Implementation of Transportation Fee Receipt Method to Facilitate Freight Consignment for Merchants
    [Report from this newspaper] Starting today (1st), the Peiping Communications Bank will trial the "Railway Transportation Fee Receipt" method to replace the cumbersome process of merchants paying freight in cash and counting it. Public and private merchants often waste time counting cash when paying freight to the railway for consignment. To facilitate merchants and reduce the cumbersome process of delivering and counting cash, the bank, in consultation with the railway, has formulated a "Railway Transportation Fee Receipt" to replace the method of paying freight in cash. All public and private merchants who wish to pay freight can first deliver the amount due (including cash or checks) to the Communications Bank. After the bank receives it, it will issue the above-mentioned receipt. All public and private merchants can then present this receipt to Peiping Railway Station (East Station, West Station, Xizhimen Station, Shijingshan Station) as cash to pay freight and complete consignment procedures.
