(Zhangjiakou News) The Xuanhua Paper Mill, under the jurisdiction of the Chahar Province Enterprise Company, plans to purchase flax straw in large quantities. Flax is one of the special crops of this province, especially in the Chahar North region. In addition to flax seeds being used for oil extraction, flax straw is rich in fiber and can be used for papermaking. The Xuanhua Paper Mill initially plans to purchase 8 million catties of flax straw and will send people to Zhangbei, Tianzhen and other places to purchase it in early October. The purchase conditions stipulate: no roots, no mixing with other kinds of straw (because in many areas flax and rapeseed are planted together), and completely dry. Purchasing flax straw not only increases farmers' income but also ensures the reliable development of the province's papermaking industry, which is of great significance in promoting material exchange and urban-rural mutual assistance. The purchase price is currently under study.

  　拟收购胡麻秸充作造纸原料
    【张市讯】察省企业公司所属之宣化造纸厂，计划大批收购胡麻秸。胡麻为本省特种农作物之一，察北地区种植尤多，除胡麻籽可以榨油外，胡麻秸因富有纤维可以造纸。宣化造纸厂初步计划收购胡麻秸八百万斤，将于十月初派人去张北、天镇等地收购。购买条件规定：不要根，不能搀杂别种秸杆（因不少地区多是胡麻与菜籽合植的），完全干。收购胡麻秸不仅增加农民收入，且使本省造纸事业的发展得到可靠的保证，在促进物资交流和城乡互助上意义极大。收购价格现正研究中。
