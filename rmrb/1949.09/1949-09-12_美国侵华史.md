　　A History of American Aggression Against China
    Liu Danian
  　III. The Struggle for Hegemony in China
　  (Continued from XIII)
    Previously, American actions in China were repeatedly obstructed by Japan, further worsening US-Japan relations. In September 1917, former Japanese Foreign Minister Kikujiro Ishii went to the United States to discuss the China issue after the war and adjust US-Japan relations. US President Wilson expressed that Japan's exclusion of American aggression against China was a failure to comply with the "Open Door" principle and was "deeply regrettable." (Note: Wang Yunsheng: "China and Japan over Sixty Years", Volume 7, page 118.) US Secretary of State Robert Lansing began negotiating an agreement with Ishii, in which Japan would guarantee the US "Open Door" policy, and the US would guarantee Japan's "special interests." On November 2nd, Lansing sent Ishii the following note:
    "The Governments of the United States and Japan recognize that territorial contiguity creates special relations between countries, and consequently the Government of the United States recognizes that Japan has special interests in China, particularly in the part to which her possessions are contiguous…They declare that they are opposed to any infringement of the rights of China or to the 'Open Door' policy, or of the principle of equal opportunity for commerce and industry in China." (Note: Published Documents of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, cited in Wang, ibid., pp. 121-122.)
    On the same day, Ishii replied to Lansing with the same content, and the US-Japan agreement was announced. At this time, the US re-emphasized the "Open Door" policy, expressing two new meanings: First, the role of this slogan in 1899 was to oppose a group of strong countries such as Britain, France, Germany, and Russia... now it was mainly to oppose Japan, and that group of strong countries had begun to be squeezed out by it, which showed the depth of American aggression against China; Second, the US equated its "Open Door" policy (or "equal opportunity") with Japan's "special interests," dividing China equally with Japan. This was the beginning of the US handling China issues on an equal footing with Japan. Japan's original exclusive advantage was squeezed out by it, which shows that the US and Japan had become evenly matched in China. From then on, the US took Japan as its main opponent and engaged in a tug-of-war process in the struggle for hegemony in China. (Note: Later, the Washington Conference announced the cancellation of the Lansing-Ishii Agreement, but Ishii said in his memoirs that this spirit had not disappeared.)
    However, the agreement to divide China on paper could never enable the United States and Japan to peacefully coexist in China. At this time, the Beijing government was headed by Feng Guozhang, one of the leaders of the Zhili faction, another faction of the Northern Warlords, who inherited Li Yuanhong's position as vice president "elected" by the original "parliament," and Duan Qirui remained the "Prime Minister." Feng Guozhang had also served as the military governor of Jiangsu and had considerable strength in the Yangtze River basin. The United States, in conjunction with Britain, secretly used the Zhili faction as a pawn to confront Duan Qirui's Anhui faction (also known as the Anfu faction) of Japan.
    In February 1918, the Soviet government led by Lenin signed a separate peace treaty with Germany. A flaw appeared in the "Allied" Eastern Front, where the US and Japan were located. Japan then, under the pretext of "joint defense against the enemy," signed the so-called Sino-Japanese Joint Defense Military Agreement with Duan Qirui and the Beijing government, stipulating that China was a "military operations area." (Note: Red Book of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, cited in Wang, ibid., pp. 227-237.) Japan's intention was, on the one hand, to force China to join the anti-Soviet campaign, and on the other hand, to further manipulate Duan Qirui to sweep away anti-Japanese forces. Seeing through Japan's scheme, the United States also quickly sent troops to Siberia. In addition to being completely identical to Japan in anti-Sovietism, the other aspect was to confront Japan head-on, namely, to contain Japan's military operations in China in order to consolidate the anti-Japanese forces of the Zhili faction. (Note: This point was known later when the Soviet representative Litvinov read the US State Department archives during the resumption of diplomatic relations between the US and the Soviet Union.) So that it could compete for China. This is the first typical example of the close combination of US imperialism's anti-Sovietism and aggression against China, and there were many more such examples later.
    Because Duan Qirui was very loyal to Japan, the loans from Japan to the Beijing government amounted to more than 500 million yuan from August 1917 to September 1918 alone, forcing Feng Guozhang to resign on the grounds that his "term of office had expired," and Xu Shichang, controlled by the Anhui faction, took over as president. This forced the United States to catch up quickly. In China, in addition to actively cultivating the Zhili faction, in 1919, American bankers and politicians, incited by the American Lincoln, once encouraged Sun Yat-sen to go to the United States to conduct activities, saying that there "was a huge amount of money available for him to do what he wanted to do." Sun Yat-sen was unable to implement this due to other difficulties. It also used diplomatic means to resist Japan internationally, launching the struggle between the United States and Japan for China at the Paris Peace Conference in the same year.
    This so-called "Peace Conference" was originally a conference for imperialists to redistribute colonies. The United States planned to accomplish two things at the "Peace Conference": one was to organize the world capitalist anti-Soviet headquarters - the "League of Nations" - to encircle socialist Soviet Union: the other was to strive for Chinese representatives as tools to resist Japan's demands on China. The Beijing government sent Lu Zhengxiang and others to attend, which happened to allow the United States to achieve this goal. Originally, the Beijing government's policy of attending the meeting under the influence of Japan was that the Chinese and Japanese representatives should consult with each other on matters concerning the East and adopt the same stance, that is, the pro-Japanese policy of listening to Japan's orders. Later, US President Wilson personally attended the meeting under the banner of complete "justice." After the activities of the pro-American faction such as Gu Weijun in the Chinese delegation, and the demands of Chinese students in Europe to the delegation to abolish the Twenty-One Demands and recover Shandong rights, Lu Zhengxiang and others changed their attitude and became anti-Japanese and pro-American. The Chinese representatives' proposals at the conference to abolish the Twenty-One Demands and recover Shandong rights were in line with the interests of the Chinese people, and the United States used the dispute between China and Japan to attack Japan. Because once Japan abandoned these rights, the United States could obtain great rights in China under the slogan of "Open Door." Wilson repeatedly insisted on China's demands in the three-headed summit of the United States, Britain, and France, but Britain and France had secret agreements with Japan and refused to agree. Later, Japan threatened that if it did not get Shandong, it would not participate in the League of Nations and would form a German-Russian bloc, and the United States had to give in. On the evening of April 30, the chief of the press section of the US Plenipotentiary Office told the Chinese representative: President Wilson "was concerned about the overall situation... and ultimately could not but compromise slightly." (Note: Lu representative's secret telegram, cited in Wang, ibid., Volume 7, page 232.) On the same day, during the day, the US, British, and French tripartite conference had decided on three Shandong clauses (Articles 156, 7, and 8) in the Treaty of Versailles, stipulating that the territory of Jiaozhou, railways, mines, and all other privileges seized by Germany would not return to China but would be inherited by Japan. When the news came, it aroused the anger of the broad masses of the Chinese people and the "May Fourth Movement" broke out. The "May Fourth Movement" severely hit the traitorous Beiyang government, making Lu Zhengxiang and others dare not sign the treaty. At this time, the United States felt the invincibility of the Chinese people's strength, and Secretary of State Lansing instructed Lu Zhengxiang and others to refuse to sign the treaty (Note: Lu representative's secret telegram: "The US Secretary of State's tone suggests that if it is impossible to retain a layer, he will of course not sign." cited in Wang, ibid., p. 352), leaving the United States with room for maneuver; on the one hand, it launched a fierce anti-Japanese campaign domestically, and some people in Congress proposed that "declaring war on Japan is not hesitate." (Note: "Eastern Magazine", Volume 16, No. 8) to directly warn Japan. In early August, it issued a statement by Wilson refuting Japanese Foreign Minister Yasuya Uchida, further denying the Twenty-One Demands. In mid-August, the Senate passed a bill: "Reserving the United States' complete freedom of action regarding disputes arising from these conditions between China and Japan." (Note: Wang, ibid., Volume 7, pp. 474-475, "Eastern Magazine" Volume 17, No. 11 records that the case was passed on November 15, Wang's book is August 16, here from Wang's book.) As a basis for later counterattacks against Japan.

  　三　争夺中国霸权
　  （续十三）
    前此美国在中国的施为，屡遭日本挠阻，美日关系更加恶劣。一九一七年九月，日本前外相石井菊次郎赴美讨论战后中国问题，并调整美日关系，美总统威尔逊即表示日本排斥美国向中国侵略，是没有遵守“门户开放”原则，“殊为遗憾”。（注：王芸生：六十年来中国与日本，七卷，一一八页。）美国务卿蓝辛（Ｒｏｂｅｒｔ　Ｌａｎｓｉｎｇ）开始与石井谈判一个协定，由日本保证美国的“门户开放”，美国则保证日本的“特殊利益”，十一月二日蓝辛送致这样一个照会给石井：
    “合众国及日本国政府，均承认凡领土接近之国家间，有特殊之关系，故合众国承认日本国于中国有特殊之利益，而于日本所属接壤地方尤为其然……且声明两国政府常于中国维持所谓门户开放或对工商业机会均等之主义。”（注：外交部公表文，载王前书，一二一——一二二页。）
    同日，石井以同样内容照复蓝辛，美日协定便宣告成立。美国这时重提“门户开放”，表示两种新的意义：一，一八九九年这个口号的作用是反对英、法、德、俄……等一群强国，现在主要是反对日本，那一群强国已开始被它挤下去，这表示出美国侵略中国所达到的深刻程度；二，美国以“门户开放”（或“机会均等”）对日本的“特殊利益”，与日本平分中国，是日美开始以对等地位处理中国问题，日本原来独有的优势又被它挤下去，这表示美日在中国已势均力敌。从此美国以日本作主要对手，经拉锯式过程，进行争夺中国霸权的斗争（注：后来华盛顿会议宣布蓝辛石井协定取消，但石井在他的外交余录一书中说此精神并未消灭云云。）
    但纸面上获得平分中国协议，绝不可能使美国与日本在中国和平共居。这时北京政府由北洋军阀另一个派系——直系头子之一的冯国璋以原来“国会”所“选”的副总统资格继承黎元洪，段祺瑞仍为“国务总理”。冯国璋曾兼江苏督军，在长江流域有相当实力，美国又结合英国暗地以直系作走狗与日本的段祺瑞皖系（亦称安福系）相对抗。
    一九一八年二月，列宁领导的苏联政府与德国单独媾和。美日所在的“协约国”东方战线发生破绽。日本便以“共同防敌”为理由，通过段祺瑞与北京政府订立所谓中日共同防敌军事协定，规定中国为“军事行动区域”。（注：外交部红皮书，载王前书，二二七——二三七页。）日本用意是一面强拉中国加入反苏，另一面则进一步操纵段祺瑞扫荡反日势力。美国看破日本谋略，也迅速向西伯利亚出兵，除一面与日本反苏完全相同外，另一面则与日本针锋相对，即牵制日本在中国的军事行动，以巩固直系反日力量。（注：此点为后来美苏复交时，苏代表李维诺夫阅读美国务院档案所知。）使它好争得中国。这是美帝国主义反苏与侵略中国紧密结合典型例子的第一个，后来这样的例子还多得很。
    由于段祺瑞对日本十分忠实，仅一九一七年八月至一九一八年九月，日本对北京政府的借款即在五万万元以上，逼使冯国璋以“任期已满”辞职，而由皖系所掌握的徐世昌接替总统。这使美国不得不急起直追。在中国国内除仍积极培植直系而外，一九一九年，美国的银行家与政客又一度由美国人林百克怂恿孙中山到美国去活动，说那里“有巨额的金钱，可供他办所要办的事”，孙中山以另有困难未能实行。又用外交手段在国际上抵抗日本，展开同年巴黎和会上美日争夺中国的斗争。
    这所谓“和会”，原是帝国主义重分殖民地的会议。美国计划在“和会”上成就两件事：一是组织世界资本主义的反苏指挥部——“国际联盟”，以包围社会主义苏联：一是争取中国代表为工具，抵制日本对中国的要求。北京政府派陆征祥等前往出席，恰好让美国达到这个目的。本来北京政府在日本影响下所决定的与会方针，是关于东方的事，中日两国代表互相协商，采同一步调，即惟日本之命是听的亲日方针，后来美总统威尔逊打起十足“正义”的幌子亲自赴会，经过中国代表团中顾维钧等亲美派的活动，又有中国留欧学生向代表团提出废除二十一条，收回山东权利等要求，陆征祥等态度，遂一变而为反日亲美。中国代表在和会中所提出的废除二十一条，收回山东权利等项，还算符合中国人民的利益，美国就利用中国与日本的争执，来打击日本。因为日本一旦把这些权利放弃，则美国在“门户开放”口号下，可以在中国获得很大的权利。威尔逊在美、英、法三头最高会议中，对中国的要求曾再三坚持，但英法与日本先有密约，不肯同意，后来日本更以不得山东，便不参加国联，并另组德俄集团相威胁，美国只得让步。四月三十日晚，美全权委员处新闻股长告诉中国代表：威总统“以大局可虑……而最后究不能不稍迁就”（注：陆代表密电，载王前书，七卷，二三二页）。就在同日白天美、英、法三国会议已决定凡尔赛和约中的山东条款三条（第一百五十六，七，八条），规定德国所强占的胶州领土、铁路、矿山及其他一切特权，不归中国而由日本继承。消息传来，激起中国广大人民的愤怒，爆发了“五四运动”。“五四运动”严重打击了卖国的北洋政府，使陆征祥等不敢在和约上签字。美国这时一面觉得中国人民力量的不可侮，也由国务卿蓝辛指使陆征祥等拒绝在和约上签字（注：陆代表密电：“美外交总长口气，似于保留一层办不到时，当然不能签字。”，载王前书，三五二页）。给美国留一回旋余地；一面在国内展开激烈反日，国会中有人提出“与日本宣战亦所不惜”（注：东方杂志，一六卷八号。）向日本直接警告。八月初，又以威尔逊名义发表一驳日本外相内田康哉声明，进一步否认二十一条。八月中旬更由上院通过一议案：“保留美国对中国与日本因此条件所引起争端之完全自由行动权。”（注：王前书，七卷，四七四——四七五页，东方杂志一七卷一一号载此案为十一月十五日通过，王书为八月十六日，兹从王书。）作为后来对日反攻的张本。
