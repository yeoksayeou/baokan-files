　　People from All Walks of Life in Beijing
  　Unanimously Support the Decision to Establish the Capital in Beijing
    The National Flag is Solemn, Beautiful, and Clearly Significant, Representing the Great Unity of the Revolutionary People
    The National Anthem Encouraged Us to Struggle in the Past and Now Encourages Us to Build
    [This newspaper reported] Workers from state-owned factories in Beijing expressed extreme excitement after seeing the news that the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference had passed six major motions. They said, "The Central People's Government is located in Beijing, which is the glory of our Beijing working class. From now on, Chairman Mao will never leave us. We must build our capital into the most beautiful and greatest capital city in the world with a new attitude towards labor." The workers of the Telecommunications Bureau No. 7 were so excited that they did not know what to do. They sang the new national anthem, "March of the Volunteers," loudly. The workers of the Telecommunications Bureau No. 2 excitedly read this news. Worker Jian Guibao said, "In the past, Beiping was under the rule of the enemy, and the workers lived a hellish life. In the future, it will become Beijing, where the people live the most freely and happily." The workers also expressed infinite love for the new national flag. Worker Zhang Dianhu said, "This is our own national flag. It was exchanged for our blood. Who can not cherish it?" The trade unions of the Telecommunications Bureau No. 3 and the 70th Ordnance Factory have begun to reprint the "March of the Volunteers" to enable every worker to learn the new national anthem. Workers at the East Water Plant of the Waterworks Company also unanimously requested to learn the "March of the Volunteers." Workers from the North China Construction Company heard the news while they were busy making lanterns and building archways to celebrate the birth of the new China. Everyone was even more enthusiastic. They said, "Construction workers must do their best to complete all the construction tasks of the new capital." Employees of Qinghe Woolen Mill and Beijing Branch of North China Electric Power Company accepted the good news with fervent hearts and actions.
    [This newspaper reported] All the faculty and staff of the North China Revolutionary University expressed their warm support for the two organizational laws and the six resolutions on the capital, national flag, national anthem, and era name passed by the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference on the 27th. Everyone believes that Beijing is located in the old liberated area of North China, and is the most suitable place to build a capital in terms of politics, economy, culture, transportation, and other aspects. Regarding the design of the national flag, it is believed that: the red color represents the Chinese Communist Party and all revolutionary people; the five stars symbolize the great unity of the Chinese people. When they saw that the "March of the Volunteers" was determined to be the national anthem of the new China, they excitedly hummed it out loud. A cadre who participated in the 25,000-li Long March said, "This song has the power to inspire the people. It represents the spirit of our nation and the spirit of heroic struggle." All teachers and students of Peking University unanimously agreed that it is very appropriate to designate the "March of the Volunteers" as the national anthem. It has been sung from the "December 9th Movement" to the victory of the Liberation War, and it can represent the national voice of this revolutionary period. The students said, "Every time we fought against the reactionaries, we sang this song, which immediately strengthened our courage and confidence in victory. It can encourage us to complete combat missions, and it will certainly encourage us to complete the great cause of nation-building." Professor Fei Qing said, "Before liberation, everyone sang the 'March of the Volunteers' with full of enthusiasm. Today, it is temporarily designated as the national anthem. I am very excited." Regarding the national flag, the teachers and students of Peking University unanimously praised, "It is solemn, beautiful, and clear in meaning. At a glance, you know that it represents the great victory of the great unity of the Chinese people's revolution." The decision to establish the capital in Beijing made all the teachers and students even more excited. Professors Wen Jiasi, Chen Mingjie, Xu Yu, and Li Youshan all excitedly expressed their opinions. Professor Chen Mingjie said, "From the perspective of the situation, Beijing is in North China, where the people's power is strong, and close to the Northeast and the Soviet Union. I am very happy that the capital is located in Beijing, and Peking University is worthy of its name." Professor Xu Yu said, "Beijing played a great role in the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal movement, and it is very good to be designated as the capital." Xie Guanjia, chairman of the student union, said, "Beijing is the center of the youth student movement. Today, it has become the people's capital. We feel infinite excitement and joy." Old Lang, a worker, said, "After the capital is established in Beijing, there will be national prosperity and peace, and abundant harvests."
    [This newspaper reported] People in Beijing's business community enthusiastically support the decision to establish the capital in Beijing. Wang Xiangchen, the manager of Cixing Iron Factory and executive director of Beijing Industrial Association, was very excited when he heard that the capital was established in Beijing. He said, "Beijing has become the capital of the People's Republic of China, which is very appropriate. Our colleagues in industry and commerce should more seriously implement the policies of the People's Government to develop production, increase capital, and expand production. We will build the people's capital and make it prosperous."
    Fu Huating, chairman of the Beijing Chamber of Commerce, believes that today's Beijing is the capital of the government organized by the Chinese people themselves. He said, "We industrialists and businessmen must develop in a direction that is more suitable for the needs of the people in the future and build the people's capital."
    Ling Qijun, manager of Renli Carpet Factory, said excitedly, "The establishment of the capital in Beijing is the supreme honor of the two million people in Beijing. I feel that our responsibility will be even greater. Beijing should play a leading role in the political, economic, educational, cultural and other constructions of the new China. This requires two million citizens to work hard under the leadership of the People's Government to succeed."
    Chen Yintang, manager of Dahua Pottery Company, said, "I sincerely support the establishment of the capital in Beijing. Beijing is located in the middle of the country, which can take care of the overall situation. It is also a place where culture gathers; the People's Political Consultative Conference with historical significance was held in Beijing, which symbolizes the great unity of all ethnic groups and the people being the masters."
    Dong Ziwei, manager of Qixin Rubber Factory, said, "Beijing is a good place and the birthplace of the revolution. Today, it has become the capital of the People's China. The people of Beijing are all rejoicing and fortunate to hear this."
