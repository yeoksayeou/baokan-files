　　Shanghai Labor Support for the Military Work Concludes Successfully
  　慰劳品 Total Value Reaches 8.7 Billion Yuan
  　General Chen Yi Points Out That This Labor Support Movement Has Played a Significant Role in Supporting the National Liberation War
    [Report from our Shanghai office on the 1st] The Shanghai Municipal Labor Support for the Military work, which has been carried out enthusiastically for a month and a half, has now concluded successfully. A presentation ceremony was held on August 31st, attended by Mayor Chen, Political Commissar Rao, heads of various agencies, representatives of the People's Liberation Army, and representatives of the general and branch labor support associations, totaling over a thousand people. This labor support movement was unprecedentedly enthusiastic. As Deputy Director Sheng Pihua of the Labor Federation said, the people of Shanghai, regardless of gender, age, or status, regarded the labor support work as even more joyful than a wedding. In the course of forty-odd days, donations included cash, checks, and real unit consolation funds amounting to 7,246,366,235 yuan, and 650,000 pieces of consolation items of 29 kinds, estimated at over 1.5 billion yuan, totaling approximately 8.75 billion yuan. There were also many items such as pennants and consolation letters. General Chen Yi spoke at the meeting amid warm applause. He first expressed his gratitude to all sectors for their enthusiastic support and then pointed out that such an unprecedented labor support movement has played a significant role in supporting the People's Liberation Army in liberating all of China. But this kind of military-civilian relationship was not seen in old China and the old era; this great unity between the military and the people can overcome all difficulties. Representative Yin Huanrong of the People's Liberation Army, in his reply, firmly stated that they would respond to the love of the elders in all sectors by eliminating bandits and special agents and liberating all of China.
