Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 24th – According to TASS, New York: The United Nations General Assembly began its general debate on the morning of the 21st. The main speaker was the head of the American delegation, Acheson. After making some general platitudes, Acheson stated the American delegation’s position on various issues on the agenda of the General Assembly. Acheson mentioned the notorious "Greek Question," the work of the so-called "United Nations Commission on Korea," the activities of the United Nations Palestine Committee, the question of former Italian colonies, the so-called "plan for assistance to backward areas," the US-proposed false accusation against Hungary, Bulgaria, and Romania regarding "religious freedom," the question of international control of atomic energy, and the question of limiting and reducing armaments. In mentioning these issues, Acheson defended the reactionary policies adopted by the United States and defended the aggressive North Atlantic Treaty concluded by twelve countries under American control. In addition to Acheson, other speakers included representatives from Brazil, Cuba, India, and Syria.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 23rd – TASS, New York: Some American newspapers are attempting to portray the American delegation as striving for "limited agreement" at the United Nations General Assembly. However, news revealed by the press shows the true intentions of the United States. Some newspapers pointed out that Acheson came to New York with a large entourage of eighty advisors (including two army generals and one navy general) and dozens of other experts from the State Department. They are holding secret meetings to draft the strategy of the Western bloc. The New York Times pointed out in an editorial that US representative to the UN, Jessup's speech in New York on September 19th, revealed the policies adopted by the United States at this conference. In this speech, Jessup stated bluntly that the United States does not expect to resolve the issue of banning the use of atomic weapons and the issue of disarmament by permanent members of the Security Council at this time. It is well known that these issues were proactively raised by the Soviet delegation. Jessup also made it clear that the US delegation's attitude towards the question of former Italian colonies, the so-called Balkan Committee, the Korean "Temporary Commission" (an institution established in violation and destruction of the UN Charter), and other issues will remain unchanged.

　　联合国大会开始一般性辩论
    【新华社北平二十四日电】据塔斯社纽约讯：联合国大会于二十一日上午起开始举行一般性的辩论。主要的发言人是美国代表团团长艾奇逊。艾奇逊在作了一般的空论以后，申述了美国代表团对于大会议程中各项问题所采取的立场。艾奇逊提到臭名远扬的“希腊问题”，所谓“联合国朝鲜委员会”的工作问题，联合国巴勒斯坦委员会的活动问题，前意大利殖民地问题，所谓“援助落后地区方案”，美国对匈、保、罗提出的所谓“建议宗教自由”的诬告案，原子能国际管制问题以及限制与缩减军备问题。艾奇逊在提到这些问题时为美国所采取的反动政策进行辩护，并为在美国控制之下由十二国缔结的侵略性的北大西洋公约进行辩护。除艾奇逊之外，其他发言者尚有巴西、古巴、印度及叙利亚的代表。
    【新华社北平二十三日电】塔斯社纽约讯：一部分美国报纸企图描绘美国代表团正在联合国大会上力谋“有限度地取得协议”。但是，自报界透露出来的消息，显示出美国的真正意图。有些报纸指出：艾奇逊带着八十个顾问的大批随员（其中有两个陆军将领及一个海军将领）与数十个国务院其他专家们到纽约来。他们正在举行秘密会议，草拟西方集团的战略。纽约时报在社论中指出，美国出席联大代表耶塞普九月十九日在纽约的演说，透露出美国在这次大会上所采取的政策。在这个演说中，耶塞普直截了当地说，美国不期望在目前解决禁止使用原子武器的问题以及安理会常任理事国裁减军备的问题。人们都知道，这些问题是苏联代表团所主动提出的。耶塞普又明白表示：美国代表团对于前意大利殖民地问题、所谓巴尔干委员会、朝鲜“临时委员会”（在违反与破坏联合国宪章的情况下所成立的机构）以及其他问题所持的态度，将继续不变。
