　　Reading "China Youth" Issue 20
    Rhyme

    The 20th issue of "China Youth" is better than before at addressing the practical problems of youth. Several articles discuss youth self-cultivation, which are worth recommending to young comrades for careful reading. Comrade Ai Siqi, in his article "On the Application of Dialectical Materialism in Life" (the article is divided into two parts, and this issue publishes the first part), tells us how to establish correct thinking methods. He connects the theory of materialism to how we should solve problems in our daily lives, such as transferring jobs and finding careers. Comrade Chen Mo's "Remember Chairman Mao's Words" records the famous sayings of Chairman Mao that he heard and remembered while educating revolutionary cadres. This issue publishes four short sections: "Willow Trees and Pine Trees," "Washing Face and Sweeping the Floor," "Starting the Machine," and "Throwing Away Burdens." Every word of Chairman Mao is profound and easy to understand, and we must carefully comprehend it. "Paul Educated Us" is written by Comrade Lu Zhi after watching the movie "Paul Kochakin" ("Paul Kochakin" is the protagonist of the Soviet novel "How Steel Was Tempered"). From this article, we can learn how a Communist Party member trains themselves. Kang Tuo's novel "A Story of an Intellectual Going to the Countryside" writes about the process of intellectuals integrating with farmers. The section published in this issue is about how the intellectual who went to the countryside went from being "extremely affectionate" to his landlord, an old Communist Party member in the old liberated area, to "getting into an argument." The novel is written in a realistic and simple style and is very interesting.

    This issue of "China Youth" is published just after the "September 18th" Incident. There is a historical account of the Chinese youth movement, Comrade Wen Jize's "'September 18th' Era Student Movement Memories," which recalls how the reactionaries under Chiang Kai-shek suppressed the students' anti-Japanese patriotic movement and created the Pearl Bridge bloodbath. Today's youth will forever remember Comrade Yang Tongheng, a Communist Youth League member who sacrificed himself under Pearl Bridge.

    Other articles, such as "Farmers Watching The White Haired Girl," "In Decadent Hong Kong," and current affairs commentaries, and writing guidance for worker-peasant youth, are all worth reading.

    This issue also newly opened "New Anecdotes," which is incisive, lively, and very gratifying.

　　读“中国青年”二十期
    和歌
    第二十期中国青年比过去能接触青年中的实际问题，有好几篇文章是谈青年修养方面的，值得介绍给青年同志们细读。艾思奇同志在“关于辩证法唯物论在生活上的应用”一文里，告诉我们怎样建立正确的思想方法（文章分上下两部，这一期登的是上部），他把唯物论的理论联系到我们调工作、找职业等日常生活中的问题应怎样解决。陈模同志写的“记住毛主席的话”，把他自己听到和记得的毛主席讲演中教育革命干部的名言记下，这一期刊出“柳树和松树”、“洗脸扫地”、“开动机器”、“扔掉包袱”四小段。毛主席的每句话都深入浅出，寓意深长，我们要好好去体会一番。“保尔教育了我们”，是作者鲁直同志看了电影“保尔·柯察金”后所写的，（“保尔·柯察金”是苏联小说“钢铁是怎样炼成的”的主角），从这篇文章里，我们可以学习一个共产党员是如何锻炼自己。康濯的小说“一个知识分子下乡的故事”，写的是知识分子和农民结合的过程，这期刊出来的一段是这位下乡的知识分子对他的房东——一个老解放区的老共产党员——怎样由“亲热的不行”到“闹蹩扭”，小说的文字写得真实朴素，富有兴趣。
    这一期中国青年出刊，正逢“九一八”刚过，有一篇中国青年运动史话，是温济泽同志的“‘九一八’时代学生运动的回忆”，里面回忆当年反动派蒋介石镇压学生的抗日爱国运动，制造珍珠桥血案，我们今天的青年永远怀念着在珍珠桥下牺牲的共产主义青年团员杨桐恒同志。
    其他如“农民看了白毛女”、“在腐烂的香港”，和时事漫谈、工农青年写作指导都值得一读。
    本期还新辟了“新语林”，一针见血，轻松活泼，很是可喜。
