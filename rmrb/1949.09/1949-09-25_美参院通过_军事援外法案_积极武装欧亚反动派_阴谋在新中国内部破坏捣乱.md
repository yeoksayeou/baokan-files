Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 24th: Washington dispatch: The US Senate passed the aggressive "Military Aid to Foreign Countries Act" on the 22nd by a vote of 55 to 24, allocating $1,314,001,000. This is another manifestation of US imperialism's war preparations, active arming of the North Atlantic Treaty nations, and continued assistance to the dying struggle of the Chinese reactionaries. In addition to the $1 billion allocated to aid the reactionaries of the North Atlantic Treaty nations, the bill specifically stipulates $75 million for Truman to expediently "aid China and general areas," $27,644,000 to aid the reactionaries in South Korea, the Philippines, and Iran, and $201,137,000 to aid the reactionaries in Greece and Turkey.

Even while passing this aggressive "aid," some members of the American reactionary group saw the inevitable failure of this "aid." According to TASS, in the final debate before the Senate vote, Republican Senator Taft vehemently criticized the bill, calling it wasteful, unreasonable, and useless, and "a violation of the principles of the United Nations and a threat to the peace of the United States and the world." Prior to the passage of this bill, the Senate had rejected an amendment proposed by Senator George to cut $200 million from the aid to North Atlantic Treaty nations by a vote of 46 to 32. This bill differs from the one passed by the House of Representatives on August 18 in two respects. The House bill stipulated that aid to North Atlantic Treaty nations be reduced by one-half from the original bill, amounting to only $505 million, and did not include a provision for "aid to China and general areas." Therefore, according to US congressional rules of procedure, the differences between the two houses must be resolved by a joint conference for a final decision.

　　美参院通过“军事援外法案”
  　积极武装欧亚反动派           
    阴谋在新中国内部破坏捣乱
    【新华社北平二十四日电】华盛顿消息：美参院于二十二日以五十五票对二十四票通过十三亿一千四百零一万美元的侵略性“军事援外法案”，这是美帝国主义进行战争准备、积极武装北大西洋公约国家并继续帮助中国反动派进行垂死挣扎的又一表现。该案中除以十亿美元援助北大西洋公约国家反动派外，并特别规定以七千五百万美元供杜鲁门权宜“援助中国及一般地区”的反动派之用，以二千七百六十四万美元援助南韩、菲律宾与伊朗的反动派，以二亿零一千一百三十七万美元援助希腊与土耳其的反动派。
    就在通过这一侵略性的“援助”当时，美国反动集团的某些人也看到这种“援助”的失败必然性。据塔斯社报道，在参院表决前的最后一次辩论中，共和党参议员塔夫脱猛烈抨击该法案称：这法案是浪费、不合理和无用的，是“违反联合国原则与危及美国与世界和平的”。在通过这一法案之前，参院曾以四十六票对三十二票否决了参议员乔治所提对北大西洋公约国援款削减二亿美元的修正案的这个法案，和众院八月十八日所通过的，有两点不同。众院通过的议案规定援助北大西洋公约国家款项较原案削减二分之一，为数仅五亿零五百万美元，同时并未包括“援助中国及一般地区”的规定。因此，根据美国会议事规程，两院间的分歧，尚须两院举行联席会议作最后的决定。
