Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 22nd: According to TASS, Budapest: The trial of the criminals in the treason case by the Hungarian People's Court has concluded. Witnesses in the treason case were questioned on the 20th, and the court began deliberations on the 20th.

The Hungarian People's Court continued to try the traitor András Salai on the 19th. Salai fully pleaded guilty to the accusations in the indictment and confessed: In 1932, he joined the Communist Youth League in Békés County. Later, when he was arrested, he was employed by the Chief of Political Police, Récz, and betrayed the underground organization. Salai was sent abroad, and after 1942, he betrayed communists such as Rákos. In the labor camp, he betrayed the youth of the Spanish Republic. To avoid exposure, Salai was sentenced to a short prison term. In the Szatoraljaujhely prison, he betrayed an escape plan, resulting in the death of sixty-four prisoners. After the liberation of Hungary, Salai infiltrated the Propaganda Department of the Hungarian Communist Party Central Committee. In 1946, Major Smiljanić, Director of the Yugoslav Compensation Administration, employed him as a spy. Smiljanić said that the entire Hungarian economy must be subordinate to Yugoslav interests. After Salai infiltrated the Personnel Department of the Hungarian Communist Party Central Committee, he helped Rób become a member of the National Assembly and sent information on the decisions of nationalized large enterprises to Brankov. In January 1949, Salai handed over to Brankov information on the progress of the purges in Hungary, the social composition of the party, and the number of people expelled and demoted to probationary membership. Salai detailed how he, according to Zöldi's orders, placed many spies in different positions.

The court then interrogated Hungarian citizen Ognjenović, accused of treason. He fully pleaded guilty and confessed that he was employed as a Yugoslav spy by Brazić of Yugoslavia in May 1948 and received subsidies. He was ordered, in his capacity as the secretary of the Hungarian-Yugoslav People's Democratic Alliance, to develop a spy organization in southern Hungary and to recruit merchants, rich peasants, and teachers in Békés County who supported Tito and provided intelligence. After the Information Bureau's resolution was published, Brankov dictated to him a neutral resolution, which was passed by the leading body of the Hungarian-Yugoslav People's Democratic Alliance.

The court then tried Béla Korondi, the former captain of the Hungarian Gendarmerie. He pleaded guilty to the charges. Korondi served in Horthy's Gendarmerie for a long time. After the liberation of Hungary, he transferred to the Military Political Department of the Ministry of Defense. In November 1946, he was transferred to the police force. In 1947, Rajk ordered him to form a mechanized infantry battalion composed of Horthy elements that could be quickly mobilized to prepare for a coup and arrest and kill Rákosi, Farkas, and Gerő. The Chief Magistrate summoned Báelfi for cross-examination. Báelfi confessed that after the coup, a fascist dictatorship would be established, because in this situation, it was impossible not to be thorough.

The court then interrogated Paul Justus, the former Hungarian parliamentarian and director of the Broadcasting Administration. He admitted that the charges against him were accurate and confessed that in 1931, he had fully agreed with the Trotskyist anti-Soviet and anti-communist program and established a Trotskyist group they called the "Opposition." He was arrested in August 1932 and employed by the Chief of Political Police, Hain. He immediately betrayed the activities of communists within the legal Social Democratic Party organizations in the fifth and sixth districts of Budapest. After the end of the war, Gachot, the press attaché of the French Embassy in Hungary, hired him as a French spy. He regularly provided Gachot with information on the friction between the two Hungarian workers' parties. After the two parties merged, he supplied Gachot with information such as the decisions of the Party Central Committee and measures against church reactionaries. In 1945, Yugoslav Jávorsky hired him as a spy. Ranković considered his work very important and sent a special person to contact him. On April 19, 1948, a Vadas, who obviously held an important position, came to see him and talked to him about preparing to overthrow the Hungarian government and relying on foreign troops, asking him to establish a Trotskyist organization. Justus did his best to win over all possible forces to prepare for the coup.

    法庭继审讯国事犯匈公民奥格涅诺维区。他完全服罪，并供称他是一九四八年五月由南斯拉夫的布拉齐区雇用为南国间谍，领取津贴。他曾奉命以匈牙利南斯拉夫人民主联盟书记的身份，到匈牙利南部发展间谍组织，又到贝克斯城招募支持铁托并供给谍报的商人、富农和教员。情报局决议发表后，布兰科夫口授他一份中立的决议案，这决议案得到匈牙利南斯拉夫人民主联盟领导机构的通过。
    法庭继审匈前宪兵队长比拉·科隆第。他对罪状供认不讳。科隆第曾长期服务于霍尔梯的宪兵队。匈牙利解放后，他转入国防部军事政治厅工作，一九四六年十一月被调到警察队任职。一九四七年，拉伊克命令他以霍尔梯分子组成能够迅速出动的机械化步兵营，准备政变，逮捕并杀死拉科西、法卡斯和格罗。首席推事传巴尔费和他对质，巴尔费供称：政变后将建立法西斯独裁性质的政变，因为在这种情况下，不干得彻底是不可能的。
    法庭继审讯匈前议员、广播管理处主任保罗尤斯图斯，他承认控诉他的罪状正确无误，并供称：一九三一年，他已完全赞同托派反苏反共的纲领，成立了他们称为“反对派”的托派团体。一九三二年八月他被捕，受政治警察长哈因雇用。随即出卖了布达佩斯第五和第六区合法的社会民主党组织内共产党人的活动。战争结束后，法国驻匈公使馆新闻参赞茄旭雇他为法国间谍。他按时把关于匈牙利两个工人政党摩擦的情报交给茄旭。两个党合并后，他供给茄旭以党中央委员会的决定、对教会反动派的措施等情报。一九四五年南斯拉夫的雅伏尔斯基雇用他为间谍。兰科维奇认为他的工作十分重要，另派专人和他联系。一九四八年四月十九日，一个显然居于重要地位的瓦达斯来见他，同他谈准备推翻匈政府和依靠外国军队的事，要他成立托派的组织，尤斯图斯尽力拢络了一切可能的力量，准备政变。
