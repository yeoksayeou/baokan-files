　　The Banner of Unity for Peace-Loving People Worldwide
　  A Record of the All-Soviet Union Peace Congress
    Stalin once said: "Moscow's merit lies in its constant exposure of instigators of new wars and uniting all peace-loving people under the banner of peace. Everyone knows that all peace-loving people look to Moscow with hope, to the capital of this great peace-loving country and the strong fortress of peace." The Soviet Union is the strongest and most reliable fortress of democracy and peace in the world, and Moscow is the heart of this fortress. Therefore, this All-Soviet Union Peace Congress held in Moscow is of great significance.

    As early as July 5th of this year, at the initiative of the All-Soviet Central Council of Trade Unions, the Soviet Writers' Union, and the Soviet Women's Anti-Fascist Committee, a joint meeting of representatives from various cultural and social organizations across the Soviet Union was held in the October Hall of the Trade Union Building in Moscow. A preparatory committee for the All-Soviet Union Peace Congress was established to prepare all matters for the convening of the congress. The convening of this All-Soviet Union Peace Congress was warmly supported by the people of the Soviet Union. Before the opening of the congress, the preparatory committee received countless letters of response from all over the Soviet Union. For example, a housewife from Zhitomir wrote: "I heard on the radio that the All-Soviet Union Peace Congress is about to be held in Moscow. This matter is very important to all of us, so I decided to write a few words to you. I am a mother of three children, and I believe that we should do everything we can to prevent the Anglo-American bankers from dragging us ordinary people into a new war." A technician from Moscow wrote: "I am a father who lost two sons in the Second World War, and I especially warmly welcome the convening of the All-Soviet Union Peace Congress..." We can cite countless letters like this, all filled with the same idea: supporting lasting world peace and opposing the instigators of new wars. In the words of an employee from Gomel: "I am writing in my own name, but I think that what I am expressing is not just my own thoughts and wishes, but also the thoughts and wishes of the entire Soviet people." By the time the congress opened, Moscow's major newspapers were publishing news of the congress on a daily basis with huge amounts of space, and the walls of streets and alleys were plastered with posters defending peace. The "Little Spark" series published a collection of poems titled "Defending Peace," and the "Crocodile" cartoon magazine also published a special issue to celebrate the convening of the congress.

    The All-Soviet Union Peace Congress was held in the Hall of Columns of the Trade Union Building in the center of Moscow. On the wall in front of the main entrance of the Trade Union Building, a huge red flag was hung with the words "All-Soviet Union Peace Congress" written on it. The rostrum in the Hall of Columns was covered with flowers, and on the red velvet curtain behind the stage hung large portraits of Lenin and Stalin, adorned with the words "Defending Peace is the Cause of the People of All Countries."

    The congress solemnly opened at 5:00 p.m. on the 25th with the sound of the Soviet national anthem. First, Academician Grelkov (historian) of the Soviet Academy of Sciences delivered the opening speech on behalf of the preparatory committee. The famous writer Fedin announced the list of the presidium, followed by Tikhonov (poet and novelist), Deputy Secretary-General of the Soviet Writers' Union, who gave a long report on "The Struggle to Defend Peace and Oppose the Instigators of New Wars." In his report, Tikhonov first pointed out the great significance of the Soviet Union as a fortress of peace, then exposed all the plans and conspiracies of the American imperialists to wage a new war, and further spoke about all the efforts made by the Soviet people to defend peace, emphasizing that "the powerful Soviet Union, whether in the past, present, or future, is a fortress of peace and international security." After Tikhonov's report was completed, the program of discussion and speeches began. At the evening session of the congress and the subsequent two days of the congress, representatives from all over the Soviet Union spoke, and foreign guests delivered congratulatory speeches. The congress finally closed at 5:00 p.m. on the 27th. At the closing session of the congress, members of the All-Soviet Union Standing Committee for the Defense of Peace were elected, totaling seventy-nine people. At the same time, congratulatory telegrams were passed to Stalin, and congratulatory telegrams were passed to the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress and all people participating in the peace movement around the world. Finally, the entire audience stood up, and the congress closed in the midst of enthusiastic cheers and applause of "Long live Stalin."

    After the closing of the congress, mass rallies with 40,000 to 50,000 participants were held simultaneously in the Green Theater of Gorky Central Park of Culture and Rest in Moscow, Palace Square in Leningrad, and the "Dynamo" Stadium in Kiev, celebrating the success of the All-Soviet Union Peace Congress and supporting the resolutions of the congress.

    In total, 1,200 people participated in this All-Soviet Union Peace Congress, representing the entire Soviet people from the Carpathian Mountains and the Baltic Sea to the Pacific Ocean in the Far East, and from the Arctic Ocean to the Pamir Plateau. Among them were socialist labor heroes of the Soviet Union, advanced workers from collective farms, famous writers, poets, playwrights, actors, and filmmakers, well-known scholars and scientists, and Soviet heroes in the Great Patriotic War. In a word, all the most outstanding people of the Soviet Union were concentrated at this congress. The famous writer Korneichuk (author of "The Front") made a meaningful statistic in his summary report on the congress: the 1,200 delegates attending the congress represented a total of thirty-three nationalities, of which female representatives accounted for 400. If divided by occupation, worker representatives accounted for 135, collective farmer representatives accounted for 113, 76 representatives were representatives to the All-Soviet Union Supreme Soviet, 139 were representatives to the Supreme Soviets of the various Union Republics and Autonomous Republics, 105 of all representatives were socialist labor heroes, 26 were heroes of the Great Patriotic War, 169 were winners of Stalin Prizes, and 1,034 had won various medals awarded by the government. From this, we can know the lineup of representatives at this congress. During the congress, a total of 32 people spoke, including scholars such as Academician Vavilov, President of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, and presidents of other Republican Academies of Sciences. Among the literary and art workers were famous writers Leonov, Sholokhov, and Vasilevska, famous playwright Korneichuk, famous poets Kolas and Isakyan, famous film director Pudovkin, and famous composer Khrennikov. Trade union representatives included Kuznetsov, Chairman of the All-Soviet Central Council of Trade Unions. Worker and peasant representatives included Roshinsky, a famous craftsman from the "Caliber" factory in Moscow, Dubinin, a worker from the "Red Viborgian" factory in Leningrad, Litovchenko, chairman of the Stalin Collective Farm in Kherson, Ukraine. Women's representatives included Popova, Chairman of the Soviet Women's Anti-Fascist Committee. Youth representatives included Ershova, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Young Communist League. Orthodox Church representatives included Archbishop Nikolai... In all of these people's speeches, they expressed the great contributions made by the Soviet people in the Second World War, the greatest efforts made in the post-war peaceful construction period, and the determination of the entire Soviet people to firmly defend peace. In everyone's speech, words like those spoken by Vasilevska echoed: "We are a people of builders, we are a people of laborers, we are a people of creators, and we fight for the peace of all peoples and the peace of the world. At the congress, no one did not know what it means to fight for peace and how necessary peace is. The struggle for this peace, the peace of all mankind, is our primary task." Among the foreign guests attending the congress were representatives from 14 countries, including Poland, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, Albania, China, Korea, France, Italy, Britain, the United States, Austria, and Germany, all of whom delivered congratulatory speeches at the congress. Britain was represented by Archbishop Johnsen of Canterbury and Professor Bernal. Poland was represented by Professor Damborzynski, Chairman of the All-Poland Peace Committee. Romania was represented by Parhon, Chairman of the National Assembly. Czechoslovakia was represented by Hojkinova-Spurna, Chairman of the Czech Committee for the Defense of Peace. Hungary was represented by Magda Joboru, Secretary-General of the Hungarian Democratic Women's League. The United States was represented by Professor Dubois. Korea was represented by Heo Heon, Chairman of the National Assembly. Italy was represented by Nenni, leader of the Socialist Party. France was represented by the famous writer Jean Laffitte. The representative of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress was Al Bryce... China was represented by Lin Qiangyun and Ge Baoquan from the All-China Federation of Trade Unions. At the congress, the Chinese delegation was very popular with the Soviet delegates and foreign guests. When Lin Qiangyun delivered a congratulatory speech to the congress on behalf of China, the speech was interrupted many times by applause. When the recent victory of the Chinese people was mentioned, the entire audience burst into enthusiastic applause. At the same time, Soviet delegates and other foreign guests often mentioned the victory of the Chinese people. For example, the famous Soviet People's Actor Khorava, in his speech, also quoted a Chinese idiom: "Unity is strength" to compare the growth of world peace forces and the success of the cause of peace.

    In addition to the three-day congress, two musical and dance evenings were held for all the delegates during the congress. Famous ballet dancers Ulanova and Lepeshinskaya participated in the performances. The Soviet Writers' Union hosted a banquet on the evening of the 27th to welcome the foreign writers among the attending guests. Fadeyev, Marshak, Simonov, Gorbatov, and Reirisky all raised their glasses to the victory of the Chinese people. On the evening of the 30th, the All-Soviet Union Standing Committee for the Defense of Peace and the Soviet Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries held a grand cocktail party to entertain all the foreign guests.

    Although this All-Soviet Union Peace Congress only lasted for three days, its achievements and significance are infinitely great. It has become an important milestone in the cause of protecting peace around the world. In the words of "Izvestia": "The All-Soviet Union Peace Congress has further expanded the scale of the movement of people of all countries to strive for peace and oppose the instigators of new wars. This congress has shown the indestructible unity of spirit and politics of the peoples of all nationalities of the Soviet Union, and has shown their determination to defend peace." In the concluding remarks of the editorial of "Pravda": "The All-Soviet Union Peace Congress held in Moscow is the most powerful manifestation of the Soviet people's will to defend peace. The Soviet people call for unity of all democratic forces. The call to defend peace resounded with special force at this congress in Moscow. The Soviet people, united around the great Leninist-Stalinist party, have brought new and important contributions to the cause of striving for peace. The All-Soviet Union Peace Congress held in Moscow has further launched the most powerful promotion of the people's movement to defend world peace."

专栏：莫斯科通讯

　　团结全世界爱和平人民的旗帜
　  记全苏联拥护和平大会
    斯大林曾经这样讲过：“莫斯科的功绩，就在于它经常不断地揭发新战争的挑拨者并把一切爱和平的人们团结在和平旗帜的周围，大家都知道，一切爱和平的人们，是怀着希望看着莫斯科，看着这个伟大的爱和平的国家的首都与和平的强有力的堡垒的”。苏联是全世界民主与和平的最坚强和最可靠的堡垒，而莫斯科又是这个堡垒的心脏，正因为这样，这次在莫斯科所举行的全苏联拥护和平大会，是具有着重大的意义的。
    远在今年七月五日时，由于全苏联职工会、苏联作家协会和苏联妇女反法西斯委员会的发起，就在莫斯科职工会大厦的十月厅，召开了一次全苏联各文化与社会团体代表人的联席会议，成立了全苏联拥护和平大会的筹备委员会，准备召开大会的一切事宜。这次全苏联拥护和平大会的召开，是深得到全苏联人民的热烈拥护的。在大会开幕之前，筹备委员会就曾从苏联各地接到无数响应的信件，象日托米尔城的一位家庭主妇写道：“我从无线电里听到，莫斯科即将召开全苏拥护和平大会，这件事，对于我们所有的人都非常重要，因此我决心写几句话给你们。我是有三个孩子的母亲，我认为我们应该尽一切力量，不让英美的银行家再把我们这些平常的人拖到新战争里去。”莫斯科城的一位技工写道：“我是一个在第二次世界大战当中失掉两个儿子的父亲，我特别热切的欢迎全苏联拥护和平大会的召开…………。”象这样的信，我们可以举出无数封来，它们当中充满了同一个思想，这就是拥护全世界的持久和平和反对新战争的挑拨者。用哥美尔城的一个职员的话来说：“我以自己的名义写信，但我想，我所表示的不只是我自己的思想和愿望，也是全苏联人民的思想和愿望”。及至当大会开幕时，莫斯科的各大报纸，每天俱以巨大的篇幅刊载大会的消息，街头巷尾的墙壁上都贴满了保卫和平的招贴画，“小火星”丛书出了一本“保卫和平”的诗集，“鳄鱼”漫画报还出了特刊，来庆祝大会的召开。
    全苏联拥护和平大会，是在莫斯科城中心职工会大厦的圆柱厅举行的，在职工会大厦正门前的墙壁上，悬有一面巨大的红旗，上面写着“全苏联拥护和平大会”字样。圆柱厅的主席台上布满了鲜花，在台后的红天鹅绒幕布上挂着列宁和斯大林的大画像，并缀着“保卫和平是全世界各国人民的事业”几行字。
    大会于二十五日下午五时在苏联国歌声中隆重开幕，先由苏联国家科学院会员葛勒柯夫（历史家）代表筹备会致开幕词，名作家费丁宣读主席团的名单，继由苏联作家协会副总书记吉洪诺夫（诗人兼小说家）作了一个“保卫和平与反对新战争的挑拨者的斗争”的长篇报告。吉洪诺夫在报告中先指出苏联作为和平堡垒的重大意义，继即揭破美帝国主义者进行新战争的一切计划与阴谋，更进而就讲到苏联人民为保卫和平所作的一切努力，并强调地指出：“强大的苏联，无论在过去现在和将来，都是和平与国际安全的堡垒”。在吉洪诺夫的报告完毕之后，就开始了讨论与发言的节目。在当晚的大会和此后两天的大会上，俱由苏联各地来的代表发言，各国列席的来宾致词。大会最后于二十七日下午五时闭幕。在闭幕前的大会上，选举了全苏联保卫和平常设委员会的委员，共七十九人。同时，并通过了致斯大林的贺电，及致全世界拥护和平大会常设委员会与全世界一切参加拥护和平运动的人士的贺电。最后全场起立，大会即在“斯大林万岁”的热烈欢呼声中与鼓掌声中闭幕。
    在大会闭幕之后，莫斯科高尔基文化与休息公园的青绿戏场，列宁格勒的冬宫广场，基辅的“狄那莫”运动场，都同时举行了有四、五万人参加的群众大会，庆祝全苏联拥护和平大会的成功，及拥护大会的决议。
    总计这次参加全苏联拥护和平大会的共一千两百人，代表了从额尔巴阡山和波罗的海到远东的太平洋，以及从北冰洋到帕米尔高原，整个广大地区上的全苏联人民，其中有苏联的社会主义劳动英雄，有集体农场的先进工作者，有名作家、诗人、剧作家、演员和电影工作者，有知名的学者和科学家，有卫国战争中的苏联英雄。一句话在这次大会上集中了苏联所有最杰出的人士。名作家高涅楚克（即“前线”的作者）在关于大会总结报告中曾作了一个有意义的统计，参加大会的代表一千两百人共代表三十三个民族，其中女代表占四百人，若以职业分，工人代表占一百三十五人，集体农民代表占一百十三人，代表中七十六人是全苏联最高苏维埃的代表，一百三十九人是各加盟共和国及自治共和国最高苏维埃的代表，全体代表中一百零五人是社会主义劳动英雄，二十六人是卫国战争英雄，一百六十九人是斯大林奖金的得奖者，一千零三十四人得过政府所奖的各种勋章，从此我们就可以知道这次大会的代表阵容了。在大会开会期间发言者共三十二人，学者中有苏联国家科学院院长瓦维洛夫及其他各共和国科学院的院长，在文艺工作者当中有名作家李昂诺夫、萧洛霍夫、华西列夫斯卡，有名剧作家高涅楚克，有名诗人科拉斯、伊萨克扬，有名电影导演蒲多夫楚和名作曲家赫兰尼柯夫，职工会代表有苏联职工会主席库兹涅佐夫，工人及农民代表有莫斯科“口径”工厂名匠罗希伊斯基，列宁格勒“红维堡人”工厂工人杜宾宁、乌克兰、赫尔森赫、斯大林集体农场主席李托甫青柯，妇女代表有苏联妇女反法西斯委员会主席波波娃，青年代表有少共中央书记叶尔硕娃，正教会代表有大主教尼古拉……。在所有这些人的发言中都表示出了苏联人民在第二次世界大战中所作的伟大的贡献，在战后和平建设时期中所作的最大的努力和全苏联人民坚决拥护和平的决心。在每个人的发言中也都响着象华西列夫斯卡所讲的这样的话：“我们是建设者的人民，我们是劳动者的人民，我们是创造者的人民，我们为一切人民的和平与世界的和平而斗争。在大会没有一个不知道什么是为和平而战并且和平是怎样的必要。为这个和平，全人类的和平，所作的斗争就是我们的第一任务”。在列席大会的外国来宾中，共有波兰、捷克、保加利亚、罗马尼亚、匈牙利、阿尔巴尼亚、中国、朝鲜、法国、意大利、英国、美国、奥国及德国等十四个国家的代表，并均在大会上致贺词。英国是坎特布里教堂的大主教约翰生和伯纳尔教授，波兰是全波拥护和平委员会主席丹波症斯基教授，罗马尼亚是国民会议主席巴洪，捷克是捷克保卫和平委员会主席霍金诺娃·斯普尔娜，匈牙利是匈牙利民主妇女联盟总书记玛格达·约布盟，美国是杜布亚教授，朝鲜是国民会议主席许宪，意大利是社会党领袖南尼，法国是名作家约翰·拉裴特，全世界拥护和平大会常设委员会的代表是阿尔布赛，……中国方面由总工会林锵云和戈宝权等参加。在大会上，中国代表很受苏联代表及各国来宾的欢迎，当林锵云代表中国向大会致贺词时，演词曾多次为掌声打断，当讲到中国人民最近的胜利时，全场曾报以热列的鼓掌。同时苏联代表和其他各国来宾也常提到中国人民的胜利，象苏联著名的人民演员霍拉瓦在发言中，还引用了一句中国的成语：“众志成城”来比拟全世界和平力量的增长与和平事业的成功。
    除去三天的大会之外，在开会期间还为全体代表们举行过两次音乐歌舞晚会，有著名的舞剧演员乌兰诺娃及列彼辛斯卡雅参加表演。苏联作家协会于二十七日晚，设宴欢迎列席来宾中的外国作家，法捷耶夫、马尔夏、西蒙诺夫、郭尔巴托夫、雷里斯基等人均曾为中国人民的胜利举杯。三十日晚全苏联保卫和平常设委员会和苏联对外文化协会，又举行了一次盛大的鸡尾酒会，招待全体列席的外宾。
    这次全苏联拥护和平大会，为期虽只有三日，但是它的成就和意义却是无限重大的，它已成了全世界保护和平事业中的一个重要的里程碑，用“消息报”的话来说：“全苏联拥护和平大会，使各国人民争取和平与反对新战争的挑拨者的运动更加扩大了它的规模，这个大会表示出了苏联各族人民的精神与政治上的不可摧毁的团结一致性，表示出了他们保卫和平的决心”。用“真理报”的社论的结语来说：“在莫斯科举行的全苏联拥护和平大会，是苏联人民保卫和平的意志的最有力的表现。苏联人民号召团结一切民主的力量。保卫和平的呼声在这次莫斯科的大会上更以特别的力量响出来。苏联的人民团结在伟大的列宁斯大林党的周围，带给争取和平的事业以新的重要的贡献。这次在莫斯科所举行的全苏联拥护和平大会，更是进一步展开保卫全世界和平的人民运动的最有力的推动。”
