　　Based on Democratic Discussion of Collective Contract
  　Labor Dispute at Five Pharmacies Resolved Through Mediation by Municipal Labor Bureau
    [This Municipality News] Since the signing of the Beijing National Pharmaceutical Industry Labor-Capital Collective Contract, it has been widely supported by both labor and management in the city's national pharmaceutical industry, and it is generally followed. Up to now, disputes have only occurred in five pharmacies, namely Jurintang, Tongchuntang, Beiqingrentang, Dashengtang, and Hongrentang. The Municipal People's Government Labor Bureau and the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions specially convened a meeting of the labor and management of the five companies involved in disputes, as well as the National Pharmaceutical Industry Workers' Union and the Trade Association, a few days ago. The meeting was chaired by Ma Guangdou, Deputy Director of the Labor Bureau, and mediation was carried out through democratic discussion in accordance with the provisions of the collective contract. At the meeting, the labor and management first explained the causes of the disputes, and put forward their own opinions on the resolution of the disputes. Then, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, the National Pharmaceutical Industry Workers' Union, and the Trade Association were invited to offer their opinions. Finally, Deputy Director Ma synthesized the opinions of all parties and proposed specific mediation methods for everyone to discuss and decide. Except for the labor-capital dispute of Hongrentang, which had reached an agreement before the meeting based on the collective contract, the opinions of the labor and management of the remaining four companies quickly converged. As a result, the four disputes were basically resolved satisfactorily within seven hours. This is the first experiment in mediating labor disputes after the signing of the contract. This experience shows the important role of collective contracts and democratic discussion in resolving disputes. For example, the labor side of Hongrentang originally insisted on a 28% commission based on turnover. After labor and management discussed it separately according to the collective contract, the workers voluntarily reduced it to 27%, and the management also voluntarily increased the welfare fund for the labor side by 10%.

　　根据集体合同民主讨论
  　五家药店劳资纠纷  市劳动局调解解决
    【本市讯】北平市国药业劳资集体合同签订以来，获得全市国药业劳资双方的普遍拥护，一般地都能遵照执行。到现在为止，发生纠纷的只有居仁堂、同春堂、北庆仁堂、大生堂、宏仁堂等五家药铺。本市人民政府劳动局与市总工会特于日前召集发生纠纷的五家劳资双方以及国药业职工会和同业公会开会座谈，由劳动局马光斗副局长主席，根据集体合同的规定，用民主讨论的方式进行调解。会上首先由劳资双方说明争执或纠纷的原因，并说出自己对纠纷解决的意见，然后请市总工会、国药业工会和同业公会提出意见，再由马副局长综合各方意见，提出具体的调解办法，请大家讨论决定。除宏仁堂的劳资纠纷已于会前根据集体合同取得协议外，其余四家劳资双方的意见，也很快地趋于一致，结果在七个小时内把四件纠纷基本上都圆满解决。这是订立合同后调解劳资纠纷的第一次试验。由这次经验，说明了集体合同和民主讨论的方式，在解决纠纷上的重要作用。例如宏仁堂的劳方原坚持要按流水提成百分之二十八，经过劳资双方各自按照集体合同讨论后，职工自动减为百分之二十七，而资方也自动增给劳方福利金一成。
