Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 18th: TASS, Moscow, 17th: *Pravda* published an article by Viktorov, "Towards Surrender to the Dollar." The article stated: The US-UK-Canada financial negotiations have concluded. The results of these negotiations, held in an extremely secretive atmosphere, have recently been published in an official communiqué, much to the disappointment of Washington, and especially London. The author asked: What are the direct results of the financial negotiations? He replied: Before assessing these results, it is necessary to recall that the main issue on the agenda was the dollar deficit of the Sterling Area, or, as the official communiqué stated, the trade and financial relations between the Dollar Area and the Sterling Area. In this regard, attention should be paid to some materials regarding the amount of the Sterling Area's dollar deficit and the reasons for its continuous increase. In the second half of 1948, the annual dollar deficit of the Sterling Area amounted to £330 million. In July of this year, Cripps already cited this figure as £600 million.

The continuous increase in the dollar deficit is not only due to the fact that under the Marshall Plan, Britain has to purchase some goods from the United States that must be paid for in dollars, but also because many sources of income that previously helped make up for the dollar deficit no longer exist. Due to the drastic reduction in capital investment, Britain's dollar income from its capital invested in Dollar Area countries has sharply decreased; the income from so-called "invisible exports" (income from shipping, banking, etc.) has also decreased. All these results stem from the fact that the above-mentioned sources of income have been seized by the United States, which has driven Britain out of its position. Finally, there has also been a huge increase in Britain's military expenditure.

The situation in other Sterling Area countries has also changed. They have changed from "dollar earning" countries to "dollar spending" countries. The reason for the drastic change in the situation of the Sterling Area countries is the dollar's stubborn and unwavering invasion of the British Empire's market. A prominent example of this is India. The United States now exports goods worth £100 million to India annually, compared to only £8 million in 1938.

The above materials clearly illustrate that the main reason for the continuous deterioration of the situation in Britain and the Sterling Area lies in the tenacious struggle between the United States and Britain for markets, and Britain is increasingly losing ground in this struggle. Due to the obvious failure of the Marshall Plan and under the influence of the increasingly serious economic crisis, this struggle has become particularly fierce recently. The intensity of this struggle and the increasing contradiction of US-British interests made the Washington financial negotiations necessary.

Viktorov went on to point out: The Washington financial negotiations did not eliminate any of the contradictions that induced Snyder and Cripps to hold consultations. The first point that opens the official communiqué emphasizes the need to make "vigorous and sustained efforts" to carry out the tasks discussed during the negotiations. The second point of the communiqué vaguely states that the participants "sought to identify what specific measures the three governments (US, UK, and Canada) could take to avoid a serious deterioration of the dollar-sterling relationship." As a result, these measures must prevent "harmful restrictions on dollar inputs to the Sterling Area." As is well known, it is precisely the increase in dollar inputs rather than their restriction that adversely affects Britain and other countries in the entire Sterling Area. The next point in the communiqué is directly against the working people of Britain and other countries in the entire Sterling Area.

Of particular interest is the point in the communiqué that discusses the issue of US investment in Sterling Area countries. As early as July, when US Treasury Secretary Snyder visited Europe, the United States, or more accurately Wall Street, proposed a significant increase in private US investment in Marshallized countries and Sterling Area countries. Audrey, the famous American banker who accompanied Snyder on his trip to Europe, announced the conditions for American private investment to the financial magnates of London. Viktorov pointed out that, judging from the official communiqué, the British Labour government has yielded to Wall Street and accepted these conditions. If the plan for extensive investment of American private capital under the conditions required by Audrey is not the unrestrained dominance of the dollar in the Sterling Area, if it does not make the Sterling Area virtually no longer within the sphere of influence of British capital, then what is it?

The content of the communiqué clearly indicates that the United States has not made concessions on tariff issues. The communiqué avoided the issue of sterling devaluation, but the attack on sterling was launched elsewhere. At the joint council meeting of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the International Monetary Fund, which opened in Washington on September 13, IMF President Gete publicly demanded a devaluation of the pound. The same request was also made by International Bank for Reconstruction and Development President Black. He used cunning language to "suggest" that Britain reduce its social services expenditure.

Viktorov wrote in conclusion that, needless to say, the official communiqué did not reveal the content of the negotiations, but even the facts cited in the communiqué are eloquent enough. If summarized, these facts can be reduced to the following: In order to obtain seemingly insignificant concessions, Britain has yielded on major fundamental issues, opening the doors of the Sterling Area wide to American capitalism. This can only mean further enslavement of Britain, and a big step towards turning Britain into the 49th state of the American Empire. The heavy burden of the new enslavement falls on the British workers, on the British people. They will have ample opportunity to experience the actions of Wall Street and the Labour Party servants of the London financial community in selling out their fundamental interests.

### 争夺市场斗争中伦敦进一步屈膝　英镑区对美元大开门户  真理报评美英加金融会谈结果

　　争夺市场斗争中伦敦进一步屈膝
  　英镑区对美元大开门户       
    真理报评美英加金融会谈结果
    【新华社北平十八日电】塔斯社莫斯科十七日讯：真理报刊载维克托罗夫所著的专文“走向投降美元”。该文写道：美英加金融谈判已告结束。这些在极端秘密气氛中举行的谈判的结果，最近已在正式公报中发表，使华盛顿特别是伦敦大感失望。作者问道：金融谈判有什么直接的结果呢？他回答道：在估量这些结果之前，必须先回想起议程上的主要问题是英镑区的美元亏空问题，或如正式公报所说，是美元区与英镑区之间的贸易与金融关系问题。在这方面，须要注意到关于英镑区美元亏空数量的一些材料以及亏空不断增长的原因。在一九四八年下半年，英镑区每年的美元亏空合三亿三千万英镑。在今年七月间，克利浦斯已经引证过这一数字达六亿英镑。
    美元亏空连续不断的增加，不仅是由于在马歇尔计划下英国不得不向美国购买一些要以美元付款的货物，而且也是由于许多过去帮助弥补过美元亏空的收入来源现在都没有了。由于资本投资的剧烈减少，英国从其在美元区国家所投资本中得来的美元收入锐减；所谓“无形输出”的收入（航运、银行等业的收入）也有减少。这一切结果都是由下述事实中产生的，即上述收入来源被美国夺去，美国已把英国从它的地位上赶走。最后，还因为英国的军费有巨大的增加。
    其他英镑区国家的情况也有改变。它们由“收入美元”的国家变为“花费美元”的国家。英镑区国家情况剧烈改变的原因，是美元顽强地坚持不渝地侵入大英帝国的市场。这方面的一个突出例子是印度。美国现在每年向印度输出价值一亿英镑的货物，一九三八年则仅为八百万英镑。
    上述材料清晰地说明英国与英镑区域情况不断恶化的主要原因，在于美英争夺市场的顽强斗争，而英国在这个斗争中则日益失势。由于马歇尔计划的显然失败以及在日益严重的经济危机的影响下，这一斗争近来特别猛烈。这种斗争的激烈和美英利益矛盾的增长不已，使得华盛顿金融谈判不得不举行。
    维克托罗夫继而指出：华盛顿的金融谈判，并没有消除诱使斯奈德与克利浦斯举行会商的那些矛盾中的任何一个。正式公报开宗明义的第一点，就强调必须进行“全力的和持久的努力”，去执行谈判期间讨论过的任务。公报第二点很含糊地说，与会者“试图找出三国（美英加）政府可以采取何种具体措施，来避免美元与英镑关系的严重恶化”。结果是，这些措施必须防止“对于英镑区的美元输入的有害的限制”。如众周知，使英国及整个英镑区域受到不利影响的，正是美元输入的增加而不是它的受限制。公报下一点是直接反对英国及整个英镑区其他国家的劳动人民的。
    特别饶有兴味的，是公报中谈论美国在英镑区国家投资问题的一点。早在七月间美国财长斯奈德访问欧洲时，美国、或者更准确地说华尔街即提出大大增加美国在马歇尔化国家及英镑区国家私人投资的问题。伴随斯奈德旅欧的著名美国银行家奥德瑞区，曾向伦敦金融界大亨们宣布了美国私人投资的条件。维克托罗夫指出，由正式公报判断，英国工党政府已向华尔街屈膝，并接受了这些条件。美国私人资本在奥德瑞区所要求的条件下进行广泛投资的计划，如果不是美元在英镑区放肆称霸，如果不是使英镑区实际上不成其为英国资本的势力范围，那么又是什么呢？
    公报的内容清楚地指明，美国并未在关税问题上让步。公报避过了英镑贬值问题，但对英镑的攻击却在别处发动。在九月十三日在华盛顿开幕的国际建设复兴银行及国际货币基金会的联合理事会议上，国际货币基金会主席盖特公开要求贬低英镑价值。同一要求也被国际建设复兴银行总裁布莱克提出。他用狡滑的用语，“建议”英国减少其社会服务的经费。
    维克托罗夫在结语时写道，不用说，正式公报没有透露出谈判的内容，但是，甚至公报中举出的事实，也是足够雄辩的。如果概括地说，这些事实可归结如下：为了取得似是而非的小让步，英国已在主要的基本问题上屈膝，向美国资本主义大开英镑区域之门。这只能意味着英国的进一步受奴役，又向变英国为美利坚帝国第四十九州跨了一大步。新奴役的沉重负担落在英国工人、英国人民的身上。他们将有充足的机会来体会华尔街与伦敦金融界的工党奴仆出卖他们根本利益的行为。
