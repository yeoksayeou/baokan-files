　　Welcoming the Asian-Australian Workers' Conference and the Asian Women's Representative Conference
    Introducing the Experience of Student Struggle
  　The Municipal Student Federation Widely Seeks Student Movement Materials
    [From Our Newspaper] The Asian-Australian Workers' Conference and the Asian Women's Representative Conference are both about to be held in Beiping. In order to introduce the heroic struggle against the U.S. and Chiang before liberation and the spirit of hard study after liberation of the students in Beiping to the democratic fighters of those brother countries who stand on the same front with us to fight for national independence and freedom, the Beiping Municipal Student Federation is now widely soliciting various student movement materials, including student movement documents, such as declarations, documents, express reports, wall newspapers, slogans, student publications, photographs, woodcuts, flags, blood-stained clothing, murder weapons, as well as photos of study life in various schools, summaries of experience, statistical materials, etc., in preparation for holding an expanded exhibition. At present, a large number of materials have been received from students of Yenching University and units such as the "May Fourth" Library of the Peking University Science Department, including various documents, manuscripts, and publications of student movements such as anti-hunger, anti-persecution, anti-American support for Japan, and anti-tyranny movements, as well as many photos and the seal of the North China Student Federation. The sorting work has now begun.
    Also, at the beginning of this semester, in order to assist in the re-election of student unions in various schools and strengthen ties with various schools, and to further understand the study and living conditions of students in various schools, the Municipal Student Federation decided to visit various typical schools starting this week. On the 12th and 13th, visits were made to schools such as Yu Ying, Girls' No. 1 Middle School, Beiman, and Boys' No. 4 Middle School.
