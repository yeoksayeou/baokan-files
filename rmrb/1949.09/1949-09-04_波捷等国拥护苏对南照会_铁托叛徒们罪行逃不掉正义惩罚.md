Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 3rd: TASS reports that newspapers in Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania, and Albania continued to comment on the Soviet government's third note to the Yugoslav government on September 1st. The Polish United Workers' Party's *People's Tribune* commented that the Soviet government's August 28th note exposed all the hypocrisy of Tito's propaganda with great persuasiveness and irrefutable logic. The note pointed out that there is an insurmountable gap between anti-people bourgeois nationalism and true patriotism based on the Marxist principle of national self-determination.

The Czechoslovak Communist Party's *Red Right* stated: The Soviet government's notes to the Yugoslav government in July and August have completely exposed the Tito fascist group, at the end of its road, relying on secret police methods to maintain its regime. But the adventurers and criminals in Belgrade have clearly overestimated their strength, just like their fascist predecessors in Berlin and Rome. The Soviet government's new note, referring again to the Galician issue of the Slovene people, contains many facts confirming that the Tito group has betrayed and sold out the Yugoslav people and betrayed the cause of peace. The note revealed the long-standing friendly relations between the Tito group and Anglo-American imperialists, and the despicable role of the Tito group in the anti-Soviet Cold War of the instigators of a new war. The Tito traitors, despised by all honest people, will not escape the punishment of justice.

Tito and his Followers are Walking Hitler's Path to Death

The Hungarian Workers' Party's organ, *Free People*, stated: The Soviet government's note is of historical importance. It is of great help to the people who sincerely support peace, especially to the oppressed Yugoslav people, exposing their most dangerous enemies and the most despicable traitors after the war, exposing the international connections of these traitors, and clearly explaining the entire political background of the rebellion. The progressive newspaper *Hungarian Daily* stated: Today, Tito and his followers are following Hitler and Goebbels in everything they do. However, since Hitler's defeat, the world has undergone tremendous changes, and the old methods can no longer succeed.

The Bulgarian Communist Party's *Workers' Cause* said: After embarking on the path of nationalism, the Tito gang joined the camp of imperialism and bourgeois reactionaries. That is why it is necessary to burn out all traces of nationalism in the Communist Party with a red-hot iron. *Izgrev* published the resolution passed by the Bulgarian laboring people's mass meeting convened to discuss the Soviet note. Workers at the "Gizdrami" rubber factory said: The cause betrayed by Tito will be victorious due to the firm struggle of the Yugoslav people. The workers called on the Yugoslav Communists to urge them to make every effort to return their country to the united family of democratic people as soon as possible.

The Romanian Independent Democratic newspaper *Cosmos* stated: The Soviet note clearly pointed out that the Tito fascist group of traitors sold out the national interests of Yugoslavia because the gentlemen in Belgrade value US dollars more than their national independence. They not only betrayed the Yugoslav people but also betrayed the camp of peace and democracy. They have taken their weapons and everything and slipped into the camp of the enemies of peace and freedom of all nations.

The Albanian News Agency quoted Tirana newspapers on the 1st pointing out that the Soviet government's note to the Yugoslav government is a new blow to the rebellious government of the Belgrade nationalist bourgeois group which launched a conspiracy to harm the people of Southern countries.

　　波捷等国拥护苏对南照会
  　铁托叛徒们罪行逃不掉正义惩罚
    【新华社北平三日电】综合塔斯社消息：波、捷、匈、保、罗、阿尔巴尼亚各国报纸九月一日续对苏联政府第三次致南斯拉夫政府照会发表评论。波兰统一工人党人民论坛报评称：苏联政府八月二十八日照会以极大的说服力和无可辩驳的逻辑揭露了铁托宣传的全部虚伪性。照会指出，反人民的资产阶级民族主义与根据马克思主义民族自决原则的真正爱国主义之间，有着不可逾越的鸿沟。
    捷共红色权力报指出：苏联政府本年七月和八月间致南斯拉夫政府的照会，已完全揭露了走头无路的铁托法西斯集团凭借秘密警察方法以保持政权。但贝尔格莱德的冒险者和罪犯显然过高估计了自己的力量，正象其柏林和罗马的法西斯先行者一样。苏联政府的新照会，再次论到斯洛文族加林西亚问题，其中包含着许许多多证实铁托集团出卖和背叛南斯拉夫人民，背叛和平事业的事实。照会揭露了铁托集团与英美帝国主义者之间为时已久的友谊关系和铁托集团在新战争挑拨者的反苏冷战中所起的卑劣作用。为一切诚实的人民所唾弃的铁托叛徒们，将逃不掉正义的惩罚。
    铁托和它的党羽走着希特勒死路
    匈工人党机关报自由人民报称：苏联政府照会具有历史的重要性，它对于真诚拥护和平的人民首先是被压迫的南斯拉夫人民是一个很大的帮助，给他们揭露了最危险敌人和战后最卑鄙的大叛徒，揭露了这些卖国贼的国际联系，并明白地说明了叛逆的全部政治背景。进步报纸匈牙利日报称：今天，铁托和他的党羽，在每一件事情上步着希特勒和戈培尔的道路。但是，自从希特勒战败以来，世界已发生了巨大的变化，旧的作法是不能再成功的了。
    保共工人事业报说：踏上了民族主义的道路之后，铁托一伙便加入了帝国主义和资产阶级反动派的阵营。这就是为什么在共产党内必须以烧红的铁来烙掉一切民族主义痕迹的原因。伊兹格列夫报刊登了为讨论苏联照会而召集的保国劳动人民群众大会所通过的决议案。“吉兹拉密”橡皮工厂的工人说：铁托所背叛的事业将由于南斯拉夫人民的坚强斗争而获得胜利。工人们向南斯拉夫共产党人呼吁，力促他们竭力使他们的国家尽快地重返民主人民团结一致的家庭。
    罗马尼亚独立民主派报纸宇宙报称：苏联照会明白地指出铁托法西斯集团卖国贼出卖南斯拉夫民族利益，因为美元被贝尔格莱德的绅士们看得比他们的民族独立还重要。他们不但背叛了南斯拉夫人民而且也背叛了和平与民主的阵营。他们已带着武器和一切溜到各民族和平与自由之敌的阵营里去了。
    阿尔巴尼亚通讯社引一日地拉那各报指出，苏联政府致南斯拉夫政府的照会乃是对贝尔格莱德民族主义资产阶级集团的叛逆政府所发动的危害南国人民的阴谋的新的打击。
