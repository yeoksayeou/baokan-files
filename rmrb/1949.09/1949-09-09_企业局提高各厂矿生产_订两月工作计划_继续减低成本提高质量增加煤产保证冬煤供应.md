　　Enterprise Bureau Enhances Production in Factories and Mines
  　Two-Month Work Plan Established
    Continue Reducing Costs, Improving Quality, Increasing Coal Production, and Guaranteeing Winter Coal Supply
    [Reported by this newspaper] The Municipal People's Government Enterprise Bureau has formulated a work plan for September and October to continue promoting the campaign to improve quality and reduce costs in all its affiliated factories and mines, and plans to expand production. In reducing costs, efforts will continue to be made to improve and save on personnel, production systems, raw materials, electricity, fuel, and management. The Tram Company and Qinghe Woolen Mill will streamline their personnel organizations, and the Pingxi Coal Mine Company will relocate to Mentougou and merge with the Mentougou mines. In improving the production system, trams and buses will implement a contracted operation system. In various enterprise factories, personal production standard recording systems, day and night shift systems, reward and punishment systems, and strict cost accounting systems will be universally implemented. Regarding raw materials, the pulp of the Yanjing Paper Mill will be improved. In terms of electricity, the Waterworks Company has already saved 30,000 to 35,000 kilowatt-hours per month, and the Qinghe Woolen Mill has saved 1,500 to 1,800 kilowatt-hours per month. It is estimated that all departments can save a total of 70,000 kilowatt-hours per month. In terms of fuel, the Tram Company has already saved 200 tons per month; the Yanjing Paper Mill workers' plan calls for saving one ton per day. In terms of management, warehouse facilities will be improved, and management personnel will continue to be educated to care for people's property, strictly inspect and correct unreasonable management methods left over from the Kuomintang era, and address the attitude of not paying attention to research and improvement in various departments. In improving quality, leakage of tap water pipes will continue to be checked and disinfection work will be strengthened to overcome the phenomenon of Yanjing Paper Mill, Xinji Chemical Pharmaceutical Factory, and other units emphasizing quantity over quality. Starting in September, engineer meetings will be held or technical research associations will be established in various mines and factories.
    In expanding production, 100 trams will be restored to operation by the end of October, and 50 trolleybuses are planned to be added. The Bus Company only had five good cars after liberation, and now 40 cars have been repaired, with 70 cars to be completed by the end of October. The Pingxi Coal Mine Company will maintain coal production in the 600-foot and 900-foot roadways of the Mentougou Coal Mine. By the end of October, three new inclined shafts will be excavated in Heishan (two have already been opened), and the Liangxiang high-line railway will be completed, increasing the daily output of the local coal mine from 200 tons to 800 tons, ensuring the supply of coal for the winter in Ping Municipality. In addition, a lime kiln with a daily output of 30 to 50 tons and a flour factory will be newly built.

　　企业局提高各厂矿生产
  　订两月工作计划
    继续减低成本提高质量增加煤产保证冬煤供应
    【本报讯】市人民政府企业局已制订九、十月份工作计划，继续在所属各工厂、矿山中展开提高质量，减低成本运动，并计划扩大生产。在减低成本上继续从人事、生产制度、原料、电力、燃料、管理等方面力求改进节省。电车公司、清河制呢厂将进行精简人事机构，平西煤矿公司将迁至门头沟与门头沟诸矿合并。在改进生产制度上，电车与公共汽车将实行包乘制。在各企业工厂中则将普遍实行个人生产标准表记制、昼夜交班制、奖惩制、严格的成本核算制。在原料方面将改进燕京造纸厂的纸浆。在电力方面自来水公司每月已节省三万度到三万五千度，清河制呢厂每月已节省一千五百度到一千八百度，估计各部门合计每月可节省七万度。在燃料方面电车公司已每月节省二百吨；燕京造纸厂工人所订计划中每天将节省一吨。在管理方面将改善仓库设备，并继续教育管理人员对人民财产的关心，严格检查纠正各部门对国民党时期遗留下来的不合理管理方法以及不注意研究改进的态度。在提高质量上将继续检查自来水管漏水与加强消毒工作，克服燕京造纸厂、新建化学药厂等单位重量不重质的现象。并于九月份起在各矿厂中举行工程师会议或成立技术研究会。
    在扩大生产上将于十月底恢复百辆电车，并计划增加无轨电车五十辆。公共汽车公司解放后只有五辆好车，现已修好汽车四十辆，十月底将完成七十辆。平西煤矿公司要保持门头沟煤矿六百尺、九百尺巷道产煤，十月底将在黑山开凿新斜井三口（现已开两口），完成良乡高线铁路，使该地煤矿日产由二百吨增至八百吨，保证平市冬季煤炭的供应。此外并将新建日产三十吨到五十吨的石灰窑一座和面粉工厂一处。
