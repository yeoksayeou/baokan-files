　　After Kailuan Abolished the Foreman System
　　By our correspondent in Tangshan, Lin Li

　　"After the abolition of the foreman system, what impact and changes have there been on production and on you personally?"

　　With an inquisitive mind, this reporter interviewed Kailuan miners who had been liberated from the exploitation of the foreman system, as well as their engineers, accountants, and trade union workers. From their respective perspectives, they echoed the same sentiment, further solidifying the belief that the Kailuan miners, with their glorious revolutionary tradition, have the courage to destroy the old system and even more the ability to build a new order.

　　Lu Changzhen, who has been a miner for sixteen years, is the deputy director of the Fourth Workers' Independent Production Cooperative, which was formed to replace the foreman system. He works as an ordinary miner in the No. 7543 coal tunnel underground. Before the abolition of the foreman system, the highest average production rate in his tunnel was 1.8 cans of coal per person (each can weighing 430 pounds, the same below). Now it has averaged three cans. Lu Changzhen explained the reason for the increased output: "In the past, any extra coal produced was exploited by the foreman system; now that this layer of intermediate exploitation has been eliminated, producing an extra ton of coal means getting an extra ton's worth of 'quan qian' (a popular term for bonus)." The "quan qian" has increased the workers' income. In the first half of the month, Lu Changzhen worked for fourteen days, and the "quan qian" he earned could buy one and a half bags of flour, equivalent to a month's monetary wage (note: in addition to monetary wages, there are also coal subsidies and flour subsidies, the latter being the main part). He passed on the "secret" that increasing production leads to more "quan qian" to all the coal tunnels, causing the output of each tunnel to increase accordingly, some even surpassing the three cans of No. 7543 and reaching a high of four cans. Now, the average output of his cooperative has greatly exceeded that before the abolition of the foreman system. Li Hongyin of the Third Production Cooperative agreed with Lu Changzhen, but he said that there is an even more important reason for the large increase in production: the improved political status of the workers. He cited himself as an example: "I started working in the mine at the age of twenty-four, and I am fifty-five years old this year, having worked for thirty-one years!" For thirty-one years, Li Hongyin suffered from the exploitation and hardship of the foreman system. Due to his superb experience and skills, he became a "cha touzi" (foreman) in charge of more than 250 workers. However, in August of last year, Kuomintang secret agents wanted him to join the party, and he said, "I don't want to rely on power to eat." He refused three times. As a result, the foremen demoted him from the position of "cha touzi" to a leader of six workers. "That was their world, so demote me, I won't join the Kuomintang anyway." Because of this heroic experience, the more than 1,500 workers of the Third Production Cooperative elected Li Hongyin as a committee member of the cooperative. Now he is in charge of not six people, not two hundred and fifty people, but one thousand and five hundred workers. He said, "This is more glorious than being promoted by the mine, and more glorious than being appointed by the foremen, because it is supported by all the workers. What else can I say but to repay them by leading production well!" Lu Changzhen pointed to his beautiful office: "Yes, yes, the political status has indeed improved. In the past, these were the places where the foremen and managers lived. Us coal miners never even dared to come near. Now, we are also sitting here 'working'!" His infinite joy perfectly illustrates this earth-shaking change.

　　Before this great change, some people knew only from books that abolishing the feudal and backward exploitation of the foreman system was a great revolution to remove obstacles to production and develop productive forces. But what would be the specific effect of doing it? Could the current production standards be maintained (they dared not imagine any development)? Would the workers consciously obey orders? ... were filled with doubts. Among them, the engineers who directly led production and were most concerned about the development of production were the most skeptical.

　　One evening after a meeting, this reporter visited engineer Yang Xicheng. He confirmed that the workers' claims of increased production were not exaggerated in the slightest. The average production in the No. 7 mining area where he worked has risen from 614 kilograms on June 15, when the abolition of the foreman system began, to more than 910 kilograms now. Engineer Yang believes that the cooperative unified the interests of the vast majority of workers, and it also solved a major problem in terms of the management of engineers. In the past, the engineers' biggest headache was that the foremen only proceeded from their immediate and partial interests to steal coal. (This not only disrupted the entire coal mining plan and buried national assets, but also posed a risk of death.) "Opposing coal theft" was a unanimous demand of engineers and the broad masses of workers. However, during the foreman system, on the one hand, under the cruel rule of the foremen, the workers only had the right to obey and no freedom to express their opinions, and they could not stop the foremen from stealing and destroying coal. On the other hand, the "cha touzi" who directly led the workers' production were the foremen's people, so they were often accomplices and specific executors of coal theft. The cooperative was elected by the vast majority of workers, and it would not violate the interests of everyone to direct the cha touzi to steal coal. The cha touzi themselves returned to the ranks of the workers, and they had no need to steal coal. At the same time, the production plan was jointly formulated by the cooperative committee members, engineers, worker representatives, and cha touzi, and not to mention stealing coal, even if they did not do well, the workers would stand up to stop it. Therefore, engineer Yang said, "Since the establishment of the cooperative, there has been no phenomenon of coal theft." He admired the workers' ability to manage themselves and run their own businesses, and was willing to learn from the workers with a sincere attitude.

　　In the accounting room of the First Workers' Independent Production Cooperative, this reporter met more than a dozen accountants from the seven cooperatives in Tangshan Mine. They were all hired during the foreman system and are still serving the cooperative now. Therefore, they also know the most details about the inside story of the foreman system.

　　Here, before the abolition of the foreman system, it was truly a typical example of corruption and depravity, an epitome of feudal and backward economic organizations. The staff members laughed and got angry when they talked about it. No matter which accounting office, there was no fixed time for office work, no filing of incoming and outgoing documents, and the ancient account books only recorded cash flow without any summary, and some even didn't have any account books! As for production efficiency, no one ever cared about it. The "diligent" foreman would come to the office when it was time to collect money, and some were even too lazy to come to collect money - like Pan Dongjia, the foreman of the third group, who would ask the accountant to bring the account book, abacus, and money bag to his bed. In addition to profligate and extravagant spending, they rarely thought about how to operate in a way that would be more beneficial to production. Gao Aiyun, a staff member of the First Cooperative, said that it is very different now. The workers' production enthusiasm, the cooperative's management ability, and the preparations for long-term construction all make the staff feel novel; at the same time, they promote their progress and efforts. Gao Aiyun said that each cooperative has purchased a large number of tools and stationery. The fifth cooperative spent more than 9 million yuan (People's Currency) on tools, which is enough for two years, which is rare in the history of the foreman system. During this period, the staff has also made great improvements in their work. For example, all account books have been changed to new bookkeeping, wage payments, production efficiency, and various charts have begun to be established. The staff themselves have also begun to study. Ma Xiangfeng explained this improvement as the driving force of spiritual liberation and social status improvement. He said that the foreman was also very disgraceful in the old society, and they were all Jianghu people from all walks of life; in Tangshan - the foreman was even a synonym for being cursed by thousands of people. "Although we are slaves hired by the foremen like the workers, we never want to admit that we are working in the foreman's office when we go out." Now, Ma Xiangfeng raised his head and said: "We are in the cooperative, serving the working class." Such a glorious position encourages their perseverance and courage, making them feel that life and work have a new interest.

　　Several trade union workers believe that the major gain from the abolition of the foreman system is the increased awareness and strengthened organization of the working class. Since the launch of the movement to abolish the foreman system in May, Kailuan Mine has been in a series of movements, almost every day, and every corner is in motion. Therefore, organizational life is also particularly lively. Such as the current activities: exposing special agents, expelling bad people; conducting a serious struggle against the phenomenon of violating labor discipline; putting forward reform requirements for various unreasonable bureaucratic systems of the mine... Although these are just beginning, they have laid a solid foundation for future recovery and development of production, and have prepared sufficient and good conditions for overcoming difficulties and overcoming difficulties.

　　开滦取消包工大柜之后
    本报驻唐记者  林里
    “取消包工大柜之后，对生产、对你究竟有什么影响与变化？”
    怀着一颗探索的心，记者访问了从包工大柜压榨下解放出来的开滦矿工，以及他们的工程师，管帐员，和工会工作者。他们从各自不同的角度，发出了同一的回声，使人们更加坚信：俱有光荣革命传统的开滦矿工，有勇气破坏旧的制度，更有本领建设新的秩序。
    做了十六年矿工的鲁常震，是代替包工大柜而起的第四工人自包生产合作社的副主任，在井下七五四三号煤洞当一个普通工人。取消包工大柜之前，他这个洞的最高平均率是每人一点八罐煤（每罐四百三十斤，下同），现在已经平均三罐了。鲁常震解释现在产量能够提高的原因说：“过去多出了煤，就白给包工大柜剥削了；现在免除了这层中间剥削，多出一吨煤，就能多拿一吨煤的圈钱（即超额奖金之俗称）。”圈钱使工人们的收入增多了。鲁常震上半月做工十四天，所得圈钱能买一袋半面粉，等于一个月货币工资的收入（注：除货币工资之外，还有煤贴与面贴，后者还是主要部分）。他把提高产量就能多得圈钱的“秘诀”，传达给各个煤洞，从而各洞的产量就一起跟着涨起来，有的甚而超过了七五四三号的三罐，而达到了四罐的高点。现在他这个社的平均产量已大大超过了取消包工大柜之前。第三生产合作社的李洪印，同意鲁常震的说法，但他说生产大量提高还有一个更重要的原因——工人的政治地位提高了。他以自己为例说：“从二十四岁下窑，今年五十五岁，做工三十一年了！”三十一年来，李洪印受尽了包工的剥削与苦头，由于经验与技术的高超，他当了统率二百五十多个工人的“查头子”。但是在去年八月间，国民党特务要他入党，他说：“咱不想靠势力吃饭。”三次劝说他都这样拒绝了。因此包工们把他由“查头子”的位置，一下降到带领六个工人的领工。“那是人家的天下，降就降吧，反正我是不入国民党。”正因为有着这样一段英勇的遭遇，第三生产合作社的一千五百多工人，选举李洪印为社务委员。现在他所统率的不是六个人，也不是二百五十个人，而是一千五百个工人了。他说：“这比矿方提升光荣，比包工委派更光荣，因为这是工人大家拥护的。我除了以好好领导生产来报答，还有什么说的呢！”鲁常震指着他那漂亮的办公室：“对，对，政治地位的确提高了。过去，这都是人家包工经理先生们住的地方。咱这煤黑子可‘牙根’儿没来过。如今，咱也坐在这儿‘办公’了！”他那无限的欢笑，正好说明这个天翻地覆的大变化。
    在这个大变化之前，某些人单从书本上知道、废除封建落后的包工大柜之剥削，是扫除生产障碍，使生产力获得发展的大革命。但具体做起来的效果如何？能否不降低当时的生产标准（他们不敢设想有发展）？工人是否自觉的服从指挥？……却又充满了疑问。其中尤以直接领导生产，也最关心生产发展的工程师们为最。
    一个会后工余的傍晚，记者访问了杨锡诚工程师。他证实工人们所说的产量提高没有丝毫夸张，他所工作的七道行，自六月十五日取消包工开始，由六百十四公斤的平均数，直线上升到现在的九百一十多公斤。杨工程师认为，合作社统一了广大工人的利益，对工程师的管理上说，也解决了一个大问题。过去，工程师们最头疼的是包工们只从眼前的、局部的利益出发去偷煤。（因为这不仅破坏了整个的采煤计划，埋没了国家的资财，而且会有死人的危险。）“反对偷煤”是工程师和广大工人群众所一致要求的。但在包工大柜时期，一方面在包工们残酷统治的压榨下，工人只有服从之权，没有提意见的自由，不能制止包工的偷煤、破坏。另方面，直接领导工人生产的“查头子”，是包工的人，所以往往是偷煤的帮凶与具体的执行人。合作社为广大工人所选举，它不会违反着大家的利益去指挥查头子偷煤。查头子自己回到工人的队伍，他也没有必要去偷煤。同时，生产计划是合作社委员、工程师、工人代表、查头子等所共同制定的，别说偷煤，即使做得不好，工人也会起来制止的。所以杨工程师说：“自合作社成立后，还没有发生过偷煤现象。”他对工人们自己管理自己，自己经营事业的能力，很表钦佩，并愿以诚恳的态度向工人学习。
    在第一工人自包生产合作社的帐房里，记者会见了唐山矿七个社的十几位记帐员。他们统是为包工时期所雇佣，现在仍为合作社服务的。因而对包工的内幕也知道得最详细。
    这里，在取消包工大柜之前，真是一个腐败堕落的典型，封建落后经济组织的缩影。职员们说起来真是又气又好笑。不论那一个柜房，办公没有一定时间，来往公文没有存卷，古老的帐簿上，只有流水，没有总结，有的连帐本还没有呢！至于生产效率如何，那是从来没人过问的。“勤”一点包工头，到领钱的时候来柜上走走，有的连领钱都懒得来——象第三组大柜的潘东家，就要会计员拿上帐本、算盘、钱袋，送到他的炕头上。除了荒淫无度的挥霍之外，他们是很少想到如何经营对生产更有利。第一合作社的职员高霭云，他说现在可是大不一样了。工友们的生产热情，合作社的经营能力，以及从长期建设的准备，样样都使职员感到新奇；同时促进着他们的进步与努力。高霭云说各合作社都制买了大批的工具与文具，第五社买工具就花了九百多万元（人民券），足够二年用的，这在包工历史上都是少见的。在此期间，职员工作上也有了很大改进，比如一切帐簿都改成了新式簿记，工资支付，生产效率，各种图表，都开始建立。职员自己也开始学习。马向峰把这种改进解释为是精神解放，社会地位提高的动力。他说，包工在旧社会上也是很不光彩的，都是那些三教九流的江湖客干的；在唐山——包工更是万人唾骂的代名词。“我们虽同工人一样是被包工雇佣的奴隶，但出了门总不愿承认自己是在包工大柜做事的。”现在，马向峰抬起头来说：“我们是在合作社，为工人阶级服务。”这样光荣的职务，鼓舞了他们的毅力与勇气，使他们感到人生与工作有了新的兴趣。
    几位工会工作者，他们认为取消包工大柜的重大收获，是工人阶级觉悟提高，组织性加强。自五月间取消包工大柜运动开展以来，开滦矿真是一个运动接连一个运动，几乎天天在运动，每一个角落都在运动。所以组织生活也显得格外活泼。诸如目前所进行的：检举特务，驱逐坏人；对破坏劳动纪律的现象进行了严肃的斗争；对矿方各种不合理的官僚制度提出了改革要求……等。这些虽是刚刚开始，但对今后恢复与发展生产，奠定了稳固的基础，给目前克服困难，渡过难关准备了充分的良好的条件。　　　　　　　　　　一九四九、九、四日于唐山
