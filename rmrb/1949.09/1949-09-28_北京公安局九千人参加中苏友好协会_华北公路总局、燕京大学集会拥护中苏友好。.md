　　Beijing Public Security Bureau 9,000 People Join Sino-Soviet Friendship Association
    North China Highway General Bureau and Yenching University Hold Rallies to Support Sino-Soviet Friendship.
    [Reported by this newspaper] After the Beijing Public Security Bureau listened to the report on Sino-Soviet friendship by Peng Zhen of the Municipal Party Committee at the Zhongshan Park Concert Hall on August 21, the Municipal Bureau Party Committee convened a joint meeting of branch secretaries to discuss the issue of Sino-Soviet friendly relations in all subordinate units. Subsequently, the report by Peng Zhen was conveyed to each department. Everyone in each unit was filled with boundless excitement and joy, eagerly signing up to join the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association. As of now, over 9,000 members have registered. The completed registration forms have been submitted by the Party Committee to the preparatory committee of the Beijing branch of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association. To better carry out various tasks related to Sino-Soviet friendship, the Municipal Bureau is preparing to establish a branch of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association. (Duo)
    [Reported by this newspaper] More than 400 people from the North China Highway General Bureau joined the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association. After the bureau's staff listened to Qian Junrui's two reports on the White Paper issue, and studied several documents regarding the White Paper, they engaged in heated discussions. Everyone conducted deep self-criticism and critique of their past muddled thinking. In particular, after listening to the report by Peng Zhen of the Municipal Party Committee, everyone gained a clearer understanding in their thinking. First, 45 comrades jointly initiated a Sino-Soviet friendship forum, which was attended by all staff. Director Cao briefly described his ideological transformation process, from a devout Christian to discovering that the path he was taking was not viable, thus transforming into a strong revolutionary fighter. Therefore, he hoped that everyone would abandon all previous illusions about imperialism and lean towards the peace fortress of the Soviet Union. Worker Chen Zhenhui said: "Eighteen years ago, in the Northeast, I saw the Soviet communists. They were sincere and friendly to people. They came to guard our door, standing outside all night in snow several feet deep without rest. At that time, I didn't know what socialism was or what imperialism was, I only knew that they were kind to people. Now that the Chinese Communist Party has come, I understand that the Soviet Union is a socialist country, a socialist country that does not invade others. Therefore, I want to join the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association and learn from the Soviet Union." Engineer Pan Weiyao said: "In the past, I studied civil engineering from the UK and the US, which I used to oppose the people. In the future, I will learn from the Soviet Union, learning tools to serve the people. Therefore, I want to join the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association." Woman comrade Wang Ruoyan said: "In the past, I thought that Americans were good to us because they ran schools and hospitals in China and gave us relief supplies; today I understand that imperialism has nothing good, and never has good intentions." Comrades spoke enthusiastically and competed to speak, and the forum continued for more than five hours. They unanimously requested to join the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association and put forward many suggestions: requesting the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association to hold photo exhibitions at any time, establish libraries and reading rooms, and introduce the Soviet Union's political, economic, and cultural aspects, as well as various revolutionary and construction experiences, to us. More than 400 employees signed up on the spot to apply to join the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association.
    [Reported by this newspaper] At 7 PM on the 24th, the Chinese Communist Party branch of Yenching University, the Student Union, and four other units jointly held a rally to support Sino-Soviet friendship, with over 600 people attending. First, Lin Shoujin, secretary of the Chinese Communist Party branch, reported on the preparation process of the rally to support Sino-Soviet friendship, and clearly pointed out two points: First, after learning from the Soviet Union's revolutionary experience, we should better learn from the Soviet Union's construction experience, so that China can be transformed from a backward agricultural country into an advanced industrial country. Second, imperialism is the common enemy of the people of the world. Therefore, we must consolidate the international revolutionary ranks and develop the friendship between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union to unite and strengthen the international people's peace forces. Then, Professor Weng Dujian delivered a speech. He first analyzed the differences between the old and new Political Consultative Conferences, pointing out that the success of the People's Political Consultative Conference indicates that China has moved towards the path of peaceful construction. Secondly, he explained the significance of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association from three points: (1) the Soviet Union's assistance to the Chinese revolution in the past thirty years, (2) China's construction must be assisted by the Soviet Union and must learn from the Soviet Union, (3) consolidate and strengthen international peace forces and overthrow imperialism. After Professor Weng finished his speech, he initiated a signature campaign to join the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association.

　　北京公安局九千人参加中苏友好协会
    华北公路总局、燕京大学集会拥护中苏友好。
    【本报讯】北京公安局自八月二十一日在中山公园音乐堂听了市委彭真关于中苏友好问题的报告后，市局分党委即召开了各支部书记联席会议，讨论在所属各单位座谈中苏友好关系问题。接着各处即先后传达了彭真的报告。各单位每一个人都是充满了无限兴奋而愉快的心情，回到本单位去争先签名参加中苏友好协会。截至目前为止，登记会员已达九千余人。登记表汇齐后，已由分党委送交中苏友好协会北京分会筹委会。为了更好的进行中苏友好各项工作起见，市局正在准备成立中苏友好支会。　（铎）
    【本报讯】华北公路总局四百余人参加中苏友好协会。该局职工自听了钱俊瑞关于白皮书问题的两次报告，又学习了关于白皮书的几篇文件以后，展开了热烈的讨论，大家都对过去的糊涂思想，作了深刻地检讨与批判。特别是听了市委彭真报告，在大家的思想上，更有了明确的认识。首先由四十五位同志联名发起举行中苏友好座谈会，全局职工都参加了。曹局长在会上简述了他的思想转变过程，由一个虔诚的基督教徒，发现自己走的道路不通，于是转变成为一个坚强的革命斗士。所以希望大家丢掉以前一切对帝国主义的幻想，倒向和平堡垒的苏联。工人陈振会说：“十八年前，我在东北，就看到了苏联的共产党员。他们对人诚恳亲密，他们来给我们看门，几尺厚的雪，整夜就站在门外不休息。那时我不知道什么是社会主义，什么是帝国主义，我只知道他们对人和气。现在中国共产党来了，我才知道了苏联是社会主义的国家，社会主义的国家，是不侵略别人的，所以我要参加中苏友好协会，向苏联学习。”工程师潘维耀说：“以前我向英美学习土木工程，是学来反人民的，今后我要向苏联学习，学习为人民服务的工具，所以我要参加中苏友好协会。”妇女同志汪若琰说：“以前我认为美国人在中国办学校，办医院，给我们的救济物资，对我们满好；今天我明白了，帝国主义没有好东西，始终没有好心肠的。”同志们争先恐后，热烈发言，座谈会继续开了五个多钟头。一致要求参加中苏友好协会，并提出了许多意见：要求中苏友好协会随时举办照片展览，设立图书馆、阅览室，把苏联的政治经济文化以及各种革命与建设经验，多多地介绍给我们。当场四百多位职工签名申请参加中苏友好协会。
    【本报讯】二十四日晚七时，燕京大学中共支部、学生会等六单位联合举行拥护中苏友好大会，到会的有六百余人。首先由主持中共支部书记林寿晋报告拥护中苏友好大会筹备经过，及明确指出两点：第一，学习苏联革命经验之后更好学习苏联建设经验，使中国由一个落后的农业国变为先进的工业国。第二，帝国主义是全世界人民的公敌。因此，必须巩固国际的革命队伍，必须发展中苏两国人民的友谊来团结和壮大国际人民和平力量。继由翁独健教授讲演，他首先由分析新旧政协的不同，指出人民政协的成功，中国已迈向和平建设的大道。其次，他从（一）苏联对近三十年来中国革命的帮助，（二）中国建设必须苏联帮助，必须向苏联学习，（三）巩固和壮大国际和平力量，打倒帝国主义三点说明中苏友好协会的意义。翁教授讲话完毕后，即发起入中苏友好协会签名。
