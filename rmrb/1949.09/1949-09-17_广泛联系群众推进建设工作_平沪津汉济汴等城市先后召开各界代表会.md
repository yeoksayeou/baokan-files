　　Broadly Connecting with the Masses to Promote Construction Work
  　Representatives' Conferences of All Circles Held Successively in Cities Such as Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Wuhan, Jinan, and Kaifeng
    [Comprehensive Report from Our Newspaper] In order to strengthen connections with the masses and broadly solicit opinions from all sectors, so as to more effectively promote various construction tasks, the Military Control Commissions and People's Governments of major and medium-sized cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin convened representatives' conferences of all circles one after another around August. They promoted the spirit of democracy and resolved many major issues in the current construction of these cities. In the Beijing Municipal Representatives' Conference of All Circles, the representatives jointly decided on the important construction work for the people of the city in the future, namely, thoroughly eliminating the activities of counter-revolutionary elements, consolidating revolutionary order, continuing to restore and develop production, and developing the people's cultural and educational undertakings. These important resolutions have been gradually implemented among the masses through various methods. The representatives attending the Shanghai Representatives' Conference of All Circles engaged in heated discussions regarding the important reports of Political Commissar Rao Shushi and Mayor Chen Yi. The representatives resolutely supported the six major tasks proposed by Political Commissar Rao: supporting the People's Liberation Army, systematically dispersing the population, relocating some schools and factories inland, changing Shanghai's production policy and development direction, mobilizing cadres to go to the countryside to carry out rural work, encouraging urban-rural exchanges, and practicing thrift. After the representatives' conferences of all circles, workers, students, citizens, various organizations and groups, and patriotic industrialists in the city have all taken action around the six major tasks. At the Shanghai Municipal Representatives' Conference of All Circles, four committees were also formed, including labor-capital relations, production problem research, organizing the return of displaced persons to their hometowns for production, and preparing for the establishment of the Shanghai branch of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, to be responsible for promoting various tasks. One of the important gains of the Tianjin Representatives' Conference of All Circles was the adoption of the "Provisional Measures for Handling Labor-Capital Relations," which were urgently needed for the current restoration and development of production in Tianjin, so that the Labor Bureau and the People's Court have a basis for mediation, arbitration, and judgment when resolving labor-capital disputes. Tianjin is a major industrial city in North China, and the basic resolution of labor-capital dispute issues allows both labor and capital to focus on production. The Wuhan Representatives' Conference of All Circles was held on the 5th of this month. Based on the specific situation in Central China, it held heated discussions on labor-capital issues, taxation issues, dock worker issues, etc., in order to ensure the realization of the major tasks of Wuhan people supporting the Liberation War, vigorously developing legitimate commerce, and preparing conditions for the development of industry. Xi'an, Datong, Taiyuan, Zhangjiakou, Jinan, Bengbu, Nanjing, Hangzhou, Ningbo, Kaifeng and other places have also held representatives' conferences of all circles one after another. Tangshan, Xuzhou and other places are actively preparing to convene them.
    The representatives' conferences in the aforementioned locations were filled with a spirit of democracy and freedom. The representatives actively attended, spoke enthusiastically, made proposals, and established standing bodies to help and promote the implementation of various proposals. Judging from the composition of the representatives attending the meeting, the local representatives' conferences included representatives from various democratic parties, the military, workers, peasants, youth, women, cultural education, science and technology, news, freelance professions, religious organizations, and other patriotic and democratic people. Before attending the conference, the representatives strived to solicit broad opinions so that they could bring them to the conference. Taking the Tianjin Representatives' Conference of All Circles as an example, before the meeting, the representatives separately collected opinions from all sectors of the masses in various factories and schools, and the various delegations concentrated the opinions from all aspects to the presidium of the meeting. This is a concrete embodiment of true democratic centralism—and is fundamentally different from false old democracy. This kind of true democracy also guarantees the success of the conference.

　　广泛联系群众推进建设工作
  　平沪津汉济汴等城市先后召开各界代表会
    【本报综合报导】平、沪、津、汉等大中城市军管会与人民政府，为加强与群众的联系，广泛征求各界的意见，以便更有力地推进各种建设工作，在八月前后都先后召开了各界代表会议。发扬民主精神，解决了各该城市当前建设中的许多重大问题。在北平市各界代表会议中，代表们共同决定了全市人民今后的重要建设工作，即彻底肃清反革命分子的活动，巩固革命秩序，继续恢复与发展生产，发展人民的文教事业等，这些重要决议，已用各种方法，逐步贯彻到群众中。上海各界代表会议与会代表对于饶漱石政委、陈毅市长的重要报告展开热烈的讨论，代表们坚决拥护饶政委提出的支援解放军，有计划的疏散人口、部分学校工厂内迁，改变上海生产方针与发展方向，动员干部下乡开展农村工作，鼓励城乡交流，实行节衣缩食等六大任务。各界代表会议后，全市工人、学生、市民、各机关团体及有爱国心的产业界人士，都已围绕六大任务行动起来。在沪市各界代表会议上，并组成了劳资关系、生产问题研究、疏散难民回乡生产及筹备成立中苏友协上海分会等四个委员会，负责推动各种工作。天津各界代表会议的重要收获之一，即通过了天津市当前恢复发展生产中急切需要的“劳资关系暂行处理办法”，使得劳动局和人民法院在解决劳资争论时，获得调解、仲裁、判决的根据。天津为华北主要的工业城市，劳资争议问题基本上解决了，劳资双方都得以安心进行生产。武汉各界代表会系于本月五日召开，根据华中具体情况，热烈地讨论了关于劳资问题，税收问题，码头工人问题等，以便保证实现武汉人民支援解放战争，大力发展正当商业，以为准备发展工业的条件等重大任务。西安、大同、太原、张家口、济南、蚌埠、南京、杭州、宁波、开封等地亦均先后举行了各界代表会议，唐山、徐州等地正积极筹备召开中。
    上述各地的代表会议，充满了民主、自由的精神。代表们踊跃赴会，热烈发言，作出提案，并成立了常设机构，帮助、推动各种提案的执行。从与会代表成份看，各地代表会都包括了各民主党派，部队、职工、农民、青年、妇女、文化教育、科学技术、新闻、自由职业、宗教团体的代表及其他爱国民主人士，代表会在赴会前，力求征求广泛的意见，以便带到大会中。以天津各界代表会议为例：代表们在开会之前，就分头向各工厂、学校征集各界群众意见，经过各代表团，把各方面意见集中到会议主席团。这是真正的民主集中制的具体体现——和虚伪的旧民主是有原则区别的，这种真正的民主，也就保证了会议的成功。
