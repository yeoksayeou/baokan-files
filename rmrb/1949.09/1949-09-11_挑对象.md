　　Choosing a Partner
    Liǔ Xī
    The honored soldier Zheng Zhuang, riding a big horse and followed by a signalman on a bicycle, had been on the road for two days, leaving the village where the Veterans Affairs Bureau was stationed. He had been severely wounded in the Taiyuan Campaign and had returned to the rear. Although his internal organs were injured, preventing him from returning to the front to fight, he requested to participate in rear work, and the superiors assigned him to the Veterans Affairs Bureau. After more than a month, Zheng Zhuang had grasped some understanding of his new job, and he took leave to go home and see the old folks he hadn't seen in twelve years.
    Early on the third morning, the animal slowly walked for a while, feeling that it was almost home. However, the scenery of his hometown seemed to have changed. He reined in, looking around, unable to remember which road to take. Vaguely turning west, the village seemed not far away. The horse shook its big ears and slowly stopped. He shielded his eyes with his hand, looking around. The wheat seedlings in the wheat fields were already neatly ridged, and the late wheat seedlings were also turning green. Looking north, he saw that kiln mound. He remembered that when he left home to join the militia, this kiln was collapsing; now it was smoking again, working again! The wheat straw piles were like mountains, and the sorghum stalks were also like mountains. The people burning the kiln were running in and out busily, truly different from those years! He suddenly remembered that his family had written to tell him that they had been allocated seven acres of good land in "Little Apricot Garden" during the land reform, and "Little Apricot Garden" was just west of the kiln mound! He immediately leaned forward on his horse. Strange! There was a young woman standing on the harrow, urging the animal to harrow the land! She also seemed to hear the sound of hooves, stopped the animal, and looked over here. Zheng Zhuang couldn't recognize who this woman was. He wondered if he had a brother who had been captured and tortured to death by the enemy when he was a village cadre during the Anti-Japanese War, without marrying a wife. He didn't have any sisters either, so what was going on? He must have mistaken the place. He spurred the horse, thinking he would go home and ask. Suddenly, a large group of people poured out from the village ahead. As they got closer, he saw men and women carrying "shoulder baskets," holding skeins of thread, carrying baskets, talking and laughing as they walked towards him. It seemed they were going to the market. Zheng Zhuang dismounted, and the large group of people walked over. He stopped and asked a young man carrying a load:
    "What village is ahead?"
    The young man stopped laughing and told him that the village ahead was Zhengjia Village. Before he finished speaking, an old man carrying a "shoulder basket" shouted excitedly: "Isn't that Da Zhuang?" Hearing his childhood name, he recognized Uncle Luo Yao, who lived at the other end of the village. At this moment, Jinzhi's mother grabbed him, saying warmly:
    "Oh! You're back! You've really made something of yourself! It's been more than ten years, your mother misses you so much."
    Zheng Zhuang saw that they were all childhood neighbors, so he hurriedly said: "So it's all folks from the village. It's been more than ten years, I couldn't recognize you from afar. Where are you all going?"
    "Going to the market. We'll come to see you when we get back."
    The people then slowly dispersed. The old men talked along the way: "That young man is really honorable. He's been awarded several merit plaques. Who doesn't respect him? I heard he's become a company commander! You couldn't tell anything when he was a kid, but he's grown up to do such great things!" One sentence after another, they all talked about the village celebrating Zheng's family's achievements.
    After the people had passed, he mounted his horse and rode towards the village. He remembered many things from his childhood. Looking at this small depression, he often played here. The road became more and more familiar. Not far from the village, the big locust tree had grown even thicker. The spring breeze gently swayed the treetops. Zheng Zhuang dismounted, stood under the big locust tree for a while, and then led his horse towards the village.
    As soon as he entered the village, someone hesitated and shouted: "Isn't that Da Zhuang back?" An old man squinting his old eyes hurriedly asked: "Which Da Zhuang?" "Isn't that Da Zhuang from the Zheng family in the west?" "Oh, my, if you don't look carefully, you can't recognize him!" People in the street heard the shouting and all ran over, surrounding Zheng Zhuang tightly. This one said: "His appearance has changed so much," that one said: "He's grown taller and stronger!" The children were even more interesting. At first, they were a little shy, but when the people talked excitedly, some hugged his waist, some reached out to untie Uncle Da Zhuang's belt, take off Brother Da Zhuang's military cap... More and more villagers gathered on the street, and the village cadres also came. Everyone crowded around, leading Zheng Zhuang, saying: "Your family has moved to the Zhao family compound in the north. That was allocated to you during the land reform, seven good brick houses!"
    Before he reached the door of his house, he saw his grandmother and mother waiting at the door. It turned out that someone had reported to them as soon as Zheng Zhuang entered the village. Grandma immediately hugged her grandson, tears of joy streaming down her face, not knowing what to say. Mother was truly happy and flustered, wanting to sit down and chat with her son, but also busy greeting the villagers. Everyone surrounded him, talking and laughing for a while, then said: "Let his brother rest, we'll come to sit later." And slowly dispersed.
    Zheng Zhuang looked at the merit plaques hanging in the center of the outer room and on both sides, the certificates issued by the superiors posted on the wall, and the bright red cabinet, the big red welcoming table, the large porcelain vases... These were all allocated together with the house. The new home after the liberation was truly different from before. Da Zhuang was extremely happy! Mother was busy going in and out, cooking and boiling water. Grandma couldn't sit still either, quietly called over his signalman, went around three north rooms. As soon as they entered the thatched shed, Grandma couldn't hold back and said:
    "Has your leader been 'free' outside?"
    The signalman looked blank, not understanding:
    "What 'free'?"
    Grandma pointed a finger at his head and said: "Hey, silly child, I mean has he 'matched' an 'elephant' outside?"
    The signalman then understood what she was talking about. Seeing the old woman's anxiousness, he couldn't help but laugh. Grandma couldn't wait, leaned closer to him and said:
    "I'm so old, how many more days can I live? Now that life is good after the liberation, if I could hold a little great-grandson, I'd be at peace even when I die. Tell me, has he been 'free'?"
    The signalman then stopped laughing, and said seriously to Grandma: "Wow! Our company commander is thinking about those things! The front has been so tense, he's been wholeheartedly focused on fighting, or else how could he be so honorable?!"
    Mother brought the washing water into the room for her son, and then came to the shed to carry firewood. As soon as she pushed the door open, she saw Grandma talking to the signalman! Grandma turned to Mother and said:
    "Da Zhuang hasn't found anyone outside yet!"
    Mother thought for a while, then whispered to Grandma:
    "If he hasn't found anyone, let's not rush to arrange it. We old people don't understand young people's thoughts. What if we say something good or bad and get blamed."
    Grandma was impatient, and when she saw Mother say not to rush, she became even more anxious. She shouted in a loud voice:
    "We have to find someone for him first."
    Zheng Zhuang was washing his face when he saw that there was no one in the room. He walked to the yard and saw the signalman standing in the corner of the wall, laughing and holding his stomach. Turning around and seeing him, he smiled and tiptoed over, squinting his eyes and saying:
    "Company Commander, the old woman is planning good things for you!"
    Zheng Zhuang couldn't figure out what was going on, and said: "Planning what good things?"
    The signalman pointed to the thatched shed: "Go listen, the old lady is thinking about holding a great-grandson..."
    Zheng Zhuang pretended not to understand and said in a low voice: "Um. Don't talk nonsense!" Then he turned to the shed and said: "What are you all doing here?" The mother and daughter then came out and returned to the room. Grandma was really impatient, before her butt was even settled, she said: "Da Zhuang, we're here helping you find someone! If you've been 'free' outside, then that's fine! Grandma is seventy-five this year, can I live another seventy-five years? Think about it yourself..."
    After a long time, Zheng Zhuang said: "Can we talk about this later?"
    Grandma didn't care and continued to say: "Your mother says that Jinzhi is a very pretty girl, and you two have known each other since you were little...", She was only halfway through when Jinzhi's mother walked under the window, shouting: "Da Zhuang's mother, Da Zhuang's mother!" Jinzhi also came along. She had grown so beautiful in the past ten years. They came into the room, Zheng Zhuang asked them to sit down. Jinzhi shyly said in a low voice: "Alright, sit down, Brother Da Zhuang!" Her dark eyes darted around, as if she had a lot to say... Jinzhi's mother grabbed Zheng Zhuang's mother and shouted in a shrill voice: "When I saw him on the road, I couldn't recognize him at all! You are really lucky, no one in our area can compare to you, that's right, you've really made it!" Mother was so happy that she couldn't speak. Jinzhi's mother pulled Jinzhi inward, saying: "Look at this little girl! She doesn't even say a word when she sees you, Brother Da Zhuang." Jinzhi smiled, walked over and sat next to Zheng Zhuang. Her big eyes kept looking back and forth at this young company commander. She saw a symbol of "People's Liberation Army of China" sewn on his military uniform, and in the upper left pocket, there was a blue-barreled fountain pen. His education must be much higher, no doubt! He must be very active in studying in the army! Thinking this, she couldn't help but raise her head, looking at his recovered face, and suddenly remembered the things they did together when they were children. At that time, when they picked firewood and bean stalks together, he seemed like a timid little girl. Now he was a combat hero riding a big horse?
    Jinzhi's mother and Da Zhuang's mother didn't talk about those old stories anymore. Jinzhi's mother stood up and said to Da Zhuang: "Stay for a few more days, come to my house when you're free! You're not outsiders, you two have been together since you were little, and..." She felt a little embarrassed to continue, "Ah, go, Da Zhuang..."
    Jinzhi turned her head back before going out: "Brother Da Zhuang, I'll definitely have to learn culture from you in the future!" After seeing the mother and daughter off, Grandma still hadn't forgotten what she was talking about just now, and continued: "Da Zhuang, what do you think of her?" Da Zhuang felt a little jump in his heart, his face also turned red, and he lowered his head without saying anything. Grandma still couldn't see through this situation, and continued to say what she wanted to say: "If you ask me, she's not as good as Dafeng. Dafeng is good at both inside and outside work. She's good at household chores and farm work. She's like a half-grown boy when she works, so practical! Da Zhuang, you don't know, after you left home, the village took care of us and helped us cultivate the land. Your father, with his straightforward temper, saw that there were so many military families in the village and so few people working, he wouldn't let them help us cultivate the land. But he couldn't do much on his own. Thanks to Dafeng's daughter helping us, if it weren't for her, our lives wouldn't be so comfortable?" The old grandma couldn't unload all these words! Before anyone could open their mouths, she抢着 said: "Dafeng is very steady and dignified, and she's also a production cadre in the village. She always says to me: 'Brother Da Zhuang is working hard outside, we have to work hard at home, no one can be idle when fighting against Lao Jiang!'"
    Mother was also making small calculations in her heart. Dafeng was really good, but she wasn't as pretty as Jinzhi. She thought that Da Zhuang was always running around outside and must want to find a pretty one. Just as she was thinking, she heard the sound of a cart and livestock calling at the door. Mother hurriedly said to her son: "Your father is back..." Then she immediately heard a woman's voice shouting: "Auntie, is Brother Da Zhuang back?"
    Mother, Grandma, and Zheng Zhuang all walked to the yard. Zheng Zhuang called out: "Father!" And helped to pack things. Father responded with a "You've come?" And began to unload the livestock. Ah! Isn't this the woman plowing the land that I saw passing by "Little Apricot Garden"? Without anyone saying it, this must be Dafeng. He saw her rosy face, like an apple, with two big, watery eyes, looking at people smartly. He could still recognize her childhood appearance. Dafeng said as she moved the plow: "I saw someone riding a horse pass by the field just now, so it was you?" Da Zhuang said: "That's right, I didn't recognize you either, take a break, I'll move it." He took the plow and sent it to the empty room in the east. Dafeng stood at the foot of the window, pulling her clothes and fanning herself. Her face was hot. After everything was cleaned up, everyone returned to the room. Dafeng wiped her face with a towel and sat on a stool. Father said to his son: "Dafeng is our benefactor, she's done so much work for us in these years!" Grandma hurriedly added: "That's right! Without her child... hum!"
    Da Zhuang said: "I've been away for so many years, thanks to our villagers taking care of us. You must have suffered a lot!"
    Dafeng said: "Don't mention it! If you weren't fighting the enemy in the front, how could we be able to farm the land?"
    After saying some idle words, Dafeng搶着 fed the livestock before leaving.
    Jinzhi was especially radiant these two days. A blue serge jacket was worn over a red thin cotton jacket, and small red edges were exposed around the sleeves, matching her white and red face, which was truly lovely. She often happily sang a梆子,小调 or something. These days, she was not only dressed beautifully, but she seemed to have something in her heart that made her unable to stand or sit still. Mother knew her daughter's thoughts, felt that her daughter looked like a watery little radish, and was about eighty or ninety percent sure. Seeing her busily, she pretended not to see. Jinzhi tidied up her hair for a long time, put on a small洋花 clip, and left with a small object. Mother peeked at her, and as soon as she left the door, she turned into the alley that led to Da Zhuang's house.
    Da Zhuang was writing a letter to his organization in the room, requesting to extend his leave for a few more days, and telling his superiors about his family's plan to find him a partner, and also raising the specific people and specific conditions of Jinzhi and Dafeng, asking his superiors for some opinions. At this juncture, Jinzhi came in, smiling and saying like singing:
    "Yo - Brother Da Zhuang, you're studying so hard after only being back for two days?"
    "Um, um." Da Zhuang hurriedly folded the letter and put it in his pocket. Jinzhi didn't care about those things, went up and搶着 to see, while saying: "We'll learn from you!" "No, this is a letter." "I have to see the letter too." "It's written to our superiors." After搶了 for a long time, Da Zhuang still didn't let her grab it. Jinzhi said: "It's fine if you don't let me see the letter, but can you let me see the fountain pen anyway?" Da Zhuang handed it to her and said: "This is a victory prize assigned to me by the superiors." Jinzhi took it in her hand and looked at it for a while, opened the pen cap and looked: "It's still a gold nib! What if it's lost?" "No, I always put it in my pocket." "Um, that's not guaranteed! Look what this is?" She took out a fancy thread fountain pen case, waving it back and forth. This was what she had been busy weaving, to put on his fountain pen. Then she put the fountain pen in Da Zhuang's pocket.
    Mother was cooking in the outer room, the door curtain was flapping, she saw everything clearly. Ah, Da Zhuang, this child, has been wandering outside for so many years, but he's still so honest. He's still so shy and well-behaved when he sees a big girl or a young woman. He's not as open as Jinzhi! This silly child...
    Da Zhuang didn't express anything about that, because he hadn't submitted it to the superiors for approval. Jinzhi also took out a small opera book, wanting Da Zhuang to help her拍拍谱, but before even looking at the tune, Jinzhi said: "We're also going to have a party to welcome you. Our troupe will perform a play just for you. Give us some advice after watching it!" It was almost noon, and Jinzhi left. Da Zhuang just sent her to the door, when he ran into Dafeng coming back from the fields. Father was calling the livestock, Dafeng was walking behind Father. She pretended not to see Jinzhi. Da Zhuang had long wanted to do some work in the fields, but Dafeng always quietly asked Father to go, not letting him be disturbed. She said: "He can't find free time for the whole year, let him rest more." Da Zhuang hurriedly迎着 the cart, unloading the livestock and taking things, the gratitude in his heart made him unable to say a polite word. He was helping his father take the food jar off the cart, when he suddenly looked up and saw Jinzhi carrying a book, holding two big sesame candies (烧饼) in her hand, eating them in big bites! Jumping and skipping, she went to the drama troupe. As soon as Da Zhuang saw it, he immediately turned his face away, lowered his head, and didn't make a sound for a long time. Slowly, he raised his head again and looked at Dafeng for a while... Dafeng was like she was in her own home. She knew where every piece of furniture was placed. She could find a lining if she needed it, opening boxes and cabinets. After tidying up and arranging everything, the mixed-grain sorghum noodles with white and red radish 温汤 were just out of the pot. Mom picked a bowl for her, and Grandma busily poured bean sprouts and仁果豆卤子 on it. Dafeng didn't let her insist or let her refuse, picked up the bowl and slurped it down. Da Zhuang ate and watched Dafeng, not knowing what to say to her. After a long time, he only said this sentence: "My family is thanks to you..."
    Dafeng was very bright, and before he finished speaking, she replied: "We're helping each other work, you help me, I help you, and everyone is entitled to preferential treatment for military families...!"
    This sentence was weighty, falling heavily into Da Zhuang's heart.
    What a lively meeting that night! The venue was in the village school in the south. Peanuts and red dates voluntarily brought by the masses were passed around in the hands of military family members. Large bowls of dried pear slices soaked in boiled water were placed in front of the faces of military family uncles and aunts. As soon as the village chief finished speaking, people pushed and shoved Da Zhuang onto the stage. Everyone kept asking him to talk about fighting and earning merit. Listen, Da Zhuang, this young soldier, began to talk. From being a soldier to being promoted to团长, the process was too simple. The more he said, the more energetic the listeners became. He said: "That time I was wounded was in Lingang. At that time, I was still a排长. The last large pillbox couldn't be taken down. The traitors were very hardcore. Talking to them was useless. Grenades, small shells, and machine guns were blasting together! We dug tunnels for two days and two nights. Because it was raining, the enemy threw grenades, and it collapsed! The团长 was so anxious that his eyes were spitting fire. At this time, I jumped out of the tunnel and requested to hold a thunderbolt. I ran there, rolled back, and held it three times in a row. I was injured, but the pillbox jumped with joy! The superiors awarded me a big merit that time..." The whole场 was like a pot was boiling, shouting and applauding, and it was so lively. Jinzhi and Dafeng didn't know why they were crowding in the front to sit down. Several thirteen- or fourteen-year-old girls were squeezing and wink with Jinzhi. Some older women were also whispering about those little girls and said. As soon as Zheng Da Zhuang finished speaking, youth member Liu Da Zhuang immediately stood up, and forcefully threw the towel on his head, patted his chest and loudly: "Villagers, Zheng Da Zhuang is so honored that I, Liu Da Zhuang, cannot fall behind! Sturdy little guys are not less than others. We will look at the script of the donkey, let's see what we can do, see us at army enlistment..." People yelled一阵 again. Then the village drama troupe sang two sections of "Blood and Tears of Enmity" and then the meeting broke up.
    Da Zhuang went back from that night and it caused great thoughts. The signalman sent him a reply letter. The superiors did not offer any opinions on this matter, but instructed him to find someone who was progressive in thought, able to endure hardships and work hard, and loved to work, and hoped that he could succeed smoothly. He looked at this letter and then thought about it!
    Who should it be? One is jumping and skipping, lively like a little doll; the other is honest and straightforward,傻出力气, and works like an ox... Thinking about it made his head dizzy, and he was a little sleepy. He couldn't decide. He slowly fell asleep. In a half-sleepy state, the seven words "able to endure hardships and loves to work" jumped out of the letter, and that strong shadow of ploughing the ground and calling the cattle came in, ... suddenly the appearance of the aqua red jacket, and leaping and skipping, ... suddenly the sight of that big chew and swallowing sesame candy also came into the... Alas!
    He didn't sleep well all night. The next day, when he opened his eyes, it was already巳牌时. He drank two bowls of yam white porridge, wanting to go to the street to walk around and see the villagers. As soon as he walked to the main east-west street, he saw Dafeng and a woman soliciting donations from the door, and their shoulders and necks were full of慰问 bags made by women. The bags were bulging and full of letters and various kinds of food. The bags were embroidered with words like "Go to Jiangnan to liberate all of China", and what "Everyone respects combat heroes", five-colored flowers and lines, shining in the sun. Dafeng kept shouting on the street: "All those who want to participate in the sewing and washing team, gather at my house." Da Zhuang no longer thought about visiting other people's homes. He turned around and went back. As soon as he entered, he said to Grandma:
    "Grandma, I've made up my mind!"
    A few days later, Jinzhi finished breakfast, and as usual, she neither washed the dishes nor washed the pot. She put down the rice bowl and said: "Mother, I'm going out for a while", and came to the street. As soon as she went to the street, she heard people shouting joyfully, all saying they were going to congratulate her. As soon as those little girls saw her, they laughed嘻嘻嘻; those young men also teased her, saying: "Zhou Jinzhi, congratulations!" Jinzhi couldn't figure out the details when she heard, her heart said: Sure it's teasing again, and she replied with a smile: "Don't just make fun of others, when the time comes, I will call you to liven it up." She then asked: "Who has a happy event today?" When she said and asked, the young men who laughed and couldn't stand straight up a long time ago said: "How can Da Zhuang dare to納貼 before getting your consent?" Jinzhi reached out and hit胖怀, smiling with pursed lips and saying: "That's right, just playing around with people!" 胖怀 said: "If you don't believe it, anyway, there is one Da Zhuang who is納貼 today." Turning his head, he asked the girls again: "You said it?" The girls and the young men all shouted in unison: "Who knows it's that Da Zhuang, anyway, there's one who is sure to have a happy event today." Jinzhi was a little stunned by what the people said, thinking: Sure it's the Qinghui director Liu Da Zhuang who has this. She thought this way, and the steps in her feet couldn't hold steady a long time ago, and rushed to turn three feet and two steps into the alley of Zheng's family. Before reaching the door of Zheng's family, from far away she saw livestock, large carts, and people in front of the door, and it was crowded in a big world, Jinzhi's heart was even more panicked, only to hear Uncle Luo Yao sweating profusely from inside and shouting loudly to the people: "Everyone go in and rest, folks, let's offer double joy, look, Da Zhuang got a combat hero which is one joy, and the combat hero married a production model, is this not a double blessing?"
    A basin of cold water poured over Jinzhi, piercing her heart, and while no one had seen her, she twisted her body and went back.
    A week after the wedding, Da Zhuang rode his horse back to his job again.

    荣誉军人郑壮骑着匹大马，后面跟着个通信员，骑着辆车子，离开荣管局的驻村，在道上已经走了两天了。他在太原战役中负了重伤，才回到后方来。他虽然伤了内脏，不能再回前方杀敌，可是他向上级要求参加后方工作，上级就分配他到荣管局。过了一个多月，郑壮对于新的工作摸着了一些头绪，他才请假回家去望看十二年不见的老人们。
    第三天一早，牲口慢慢地走了一阵，觉着快到家了。可是，家乡的景物好象变了个样儿，他勒着缰绳，东瞧西望地，记不清走那条道儿对。模模糊糊地向西一拐，村子好象离着不远了，马摇着大耳朵，慢慢地停下来。他手搭凉棚往四下看，留麦地的麦苗已经齐垄了，插耙（晚麦）呢，也翻青了。往北一看，看见那个窑疙疸，他可想起来了，他离家参加小队那年，这个窑东倒西坍；现在又冒着青烟，作起活来啦！麦秸堆象山，秫秸垛也象山，烧窑的人跑进跑出地忙活着，真是跟当年大不一样了！他忽然想起，家里写信告诉过他，土地改革时在“小杏园”分了七亩好地，“小杏园”就在窑疙疸的西边啊！他立刻在马上翘起身子来。奇怪！那块地里有个年青的妇女站在耙上吆喝着牲口耙地哩！她也好象听见了马蹄的声音，停下牲口往这边看了看。郑壮到底也认不清这妇女是谁，心里寻思着自己倒是有个兄弟，抗日的时候当村干部被敌人捕了去，拷打死了，也没有娶下媳妇；自己又没个姐妹，怎么回事呢？准是认错了地方。他把缰绳一催，想着回到家再说。忽然从前面村里涌出来一大帮子人，走近了，他才看见男男女女有的背着“捎马”，有的提溜着线穗子，挎着篮子，说着笑着向这边走来，看来这准是去赶集的。郑壮下了马，大帮子人都走过来了，他站住问那个挑担的小伙子说：
    “前边是什么村？”
    那小伙子住了笑声，告诉他前边就是郑家庄，这句话还没有说完，一个背着“捎马”的老头，高兴的嚷了起来：“这不是大壮吗？”他一听叫出自己的小名，才认出来是住在一头的洛耀大伯，这时金枝娘一把拽着他，亲热地说：
    “啊呀！你可回来啦，真出息啦！十几年不见，把你妈都想坏了。”
    郑壮一看都是自小的街坊四邻，也就忙着说：“敢情都是乡亲们，十几年不见，远远地都认不准了，你们上那儿去？”
    “赶集去。回来俺们去看你。”
    人们这才慢慢地散去，老头们一路上讲着：“人家这个小子可真光彩啦，挂了好几回功劳匾，谁不敬着人家，听说当上连长啦！小时候也看不出什么来，长大了竟能办这么大事！”你一句，我一句，都讲起村里给郑家庆功的事来。
    等人们走过去，他才跨上马往村里走来，他想起小时候的许多事儿，看看这个小洼，小时常在这玩呵，道儿越走可就越熟了。离村不远，那棵大槐树长得更粗实了，春天的风，吹得树梢儿轻轻地幌着。郑壮下了马，在大槐树底下立了一会儿，才牵着马往村里走来。
    一进村，一个人迟疑了一下叫起来：“这不是大壮回来啦？”一个老头眯缝着老花眼忙问：“那一个大壮？”“那不是西头郑家那大壮吗？”“哎哟，可不，不仔细看简直认不得啦！”当街人们听到嚷嚷全跑来了，把郑壮围了个严实。这个说：“模样改得多啦，”那个说：“长高了，也壮了！”小孩们更有意思，乍一开头还有点怯，等人们一说得热闹，他们就有的搂腰，有的动手，解大壮叔的皮带，摘大壮哥的军帽……一条街上，乡亲们越来越多，村干部们也来了，大伙挤着拥着给郑壮带着道，说是：“你们家挪到北头赵家大院去了，那是土地改革时分给你们的，七间好砖屋哩！”
    还没到家门上，早看见他奶奶、娘在门口等着呢。原来，郑壮才进村早就有人给他们报了信儿。奶奶一下子抱住了大孙子，乐的流出眼泪来，不知说什么好，娘真是喜欢的手忙脚乱，又想坐下跟儿子拉拉话，可又忙着招呼乡亲，大家围着说笑了一出子，才说：“让他哥歇歇吧，断不了来坐着”。就慢慢散去。
    郑壮看看外间堂屋正中和两旁都挂着自己的功劳匾，墙上贴着上级发给的奖状，又看看屋里亮堂堂地立着大红柜，大红迎门桌，大磁瓶，……这些都是和房子一起分的，翻身后的新家真是和从前大不相同，大壮心里高兴极了！娘忙着里出外进的烧火做饭，烧开水。奶奶可也坐不住，小声叫过他的通信员，转过三间北屋，刚一进草厦子，奶奶蹩不住就说：
    “你们这个头儿，在外边‘自由’上了没？”
    通信员楞呼呼地摸不着头脑：
    “什么‘自由’上啦？”
    奶奶一个手指头指在他的头脑上说：“哎，傻孩子，俺是说他在外边‘对’了‘象’啦不？”
    通信员这才听出是什么事，看看老人那股子着急劲就止不住的乐，奶奶可等不得啦，凑过他来说：
    “俺这么大岁数，还能活上几天，眼下翻身日子也好过了，要再能抱个小重孙子，就是死了也心里踏实。你说他倒是‘自由’上了没？”
    通信员这才住了笑声，正正经经的跟奶奶说：“嚯！俺们连长还想得到那些事啦！前方一直这么紧张，他光是一心一意钻到打仗的事儿上了，要不就这么光荣啦？！”
    娘把洗脸水给儿子端进屋去，又到厦子里来抱柴禾，一推门正看见奶奶跟通信员说什么呢！奶奶回头跟娘说了一句：
    “大壮在外边还没寻上人哪！”
    娘寻思了一会，才跟奶奶小声的说：
    “没寻上咱们也别太紧着张罗，咱上年纪的人不懂得年青人们的心思，万一说得好哇孬的，落埋怨。
    奶奶性急，一看娘说别太紧喽就更着急啦，大噪门才喊了一句：
    “咱们得先给打量个人。”
    郑壮洗着脸一看怎么屋里一个人儿也没有，才走到院里，看见通信员站在墙拐角正乐的捧着肚子呢，一回头看见他就笑着蹑手蹑脚的走过来，眯缝着眼儿才说呢：
    “连长，老人给你合计好事哪！”
    郑壮摸不清怎么回事，说：“合计什么好事？”
    通信员往草厦子一指：“你去听听吧，老太太想着抱小重孙啦…”
    郑壮装着听不懂，低着嗓子说：“嗯。别瞎说！”接着转脸对厦子说：“都在这儿干吗？”婆母俩这才走出来，回到屋里。奶奶真性急，屁股还没坐稳当，就说：“大壮，俺们正在这儿给你合兑着寻人哪！你要是在外边‘自由’上，也就罢了！奶奶今年七十五，还能活个七十五吗？自个儿拿摸拿摸……”
    呆了半天，郑壮才说：“咱们以后再说这个行呗？”
    奶奶不管不顾，还是接着说：“你娘说金枝这个闺女挺俊俏，你们俩又是从小就……”，正说到半截，金枝她娘正走到窗户底下，喊着：“大壮他娘，大壮他娘！”金枝也跟来了，十来年不见，她可长得这么俊秀了。她们走进屋里来，郑壮让她们坐下，金枝害羞似的小声说：“行喽坐吧，大壮哥！”乌黑的大眼滴溜滴溜乱转，象是有很多话要说……金枝她娘一把拉着郑壮他娘，尖着嗓子才喊呢：“道上乍一见，简直认不得他了！”你可真是个有福气的，咱们这一发的谁比得上你，可不呗，你算是得了济啦！”娘乐的也说不上话来。金枝她娘把金枝往里边拽了一把，说：“你们看看这个小妮子！见了你大壮哥也不说个话。”金枝笑了笑，走过来挨着郑壮坐下，她的大眼睛不住的在这位年青连长身上来回打量。她瞅见军服上面还缝着一个“中国人民解放军”的符号，就在左上角的口袋里，插着一枝蓝杆的钢笔。人家的文化准高多了，那还用说！人家在队上学习说不定多积极啦！她想着不由得抬起脑袋，看着他已恢复健康的脸，一下子想起他们小时候的事儿来了。那工夫，在一块拾柴拣豆棍，他好象个怯生生的小丫头，这工夫人家是骑着大马的战斗英雄啦？
    金枝娘跟大壮娘这工夫也不说那些陈谷子烂芝麻的话儿了。金枝娘站起来给大壮说：“多住几天吧，闲着到俺家去啊！又不是外人，你们俩自小就在一块，也……”她说到这里又觉着不大好意思再往下说了，“啊，去吧，大壮……”
    金枝临出门还回过头来：“大壮哥，以后断不了得跟你学习文化哩！”把这娘俩送出去以后，奶奶可还没忘刚才的话头，接着说：“大壮，你瞧着她怎么样？”大壮心里觉着有点跳，脸也红了，低下头没言语。奶奶还看不透这个风色，仍旧说她自个想说的话：“要依我说，可就不如人家大凤好。大凤又能打里，又能打外，家里是家里的活，地里是地里的活，干起来，泼泼实实地活象个半大小伙子！大壮，你可不知道，你离开家以后，村里照顾咱，给咱代耕，你爹那耿直脾气，一看村里军属这么多，作活的人少，非不让代耕不可，可他一个人磨磨蹭蹭地又做不了多少，亏了人家大凤那闺女跟咱互助，要不仗着人家，咱的日子能过的这么舒舒坦坦的？”老奶奶这一车话可就紧忙的卸不完啦！还没等别人张嘴，又抢着说：“人家大凤多稳稳重重，还当着村里的生产干部，她净跟俺说：‘大壮哥在外边出力，咱就得在家出力呗，打老蒋谁也不能闲着！’”
    娘这工夫心眼儿里也打着小算盘；要说大凤真是不赖，可就是不如金枝长的俊，她想大壮总在外边跑＠，准是愿意找个俊的。正想着，就听见门口来了大车吆喝牲口呢。娘忙给儿子说：“你爹回来了……”立时又听见一个妇女的喊声：“婶子，是大壮哥回来啦？”
    娘、奶奶、郑壮，都走到院里，郑壮叫了一声：“爹！”就帮着收拾东西，爹应了一声“才来啊？”就卸起牲口来。啊！这不是路过“小杏园”看见的那个耙地的妇女吗？不用人说，这准是大凤了。他看见她那红润的脸色好象苹果，水汪汪两颗大眼，伶俐地望着人，还能辨出小时的模样来。大凤一边搬着耙一边说：“刚才俺看见一个骑马的在地头上过，原来是你呀？”大壮说：“可不是，我也没认出你来，快歇歇吧，我搬。”接过耙来，送到东间闲空屋里，大凤站在窗根底下扯起衣襟扇着，脸上冒着热气，都收拾完了，大伙才回到屋里，大凤一边用手巾擦脸，一边坐在几凳上，爹跟儿子说：“大凤可是咱们的恩人，这几年人家给咱干了多少活啊！”奶奶忙接上一句：“可不呗！没有人家孩子……哼！”
    大壮说：“我出去这么些年，多亏咱们乡亲照管，你可没少受了累！”
    大凤说：“说那儿的话！没有你们在前方打敌人，咱还能种地喽？”
    又说了些闲话，大凤抢着喂上牲口才走了。
    金枝这两天可格外鲜，蓝士林的外褂套在红色的薄棉袄上边，四周围跟袖口都露出一溜遭儿小红边来，配上她那又白又红的脸蛋儿，真叫人爱。嘴里常常欢喜唱个梆子、小调什么的。这两天她不光穿的漂亮，心眼里好象有个什么事儿似的总是站不下坐不稳。娘可知道闺女的小心思，觉着自己的闺女长的象个水凌凌的小水萝＠，准有个八九成的把握，瞧着她忙忙活活的，也装着看不见。金枝拢了半天脑袋，戴上一个小洋花卡子，拿着个小物件就走了。娘偷看看她，刚出门一拐弯就进了大壮家那条过道里去了。
    大壮正在屋里给他的本机关写信，请求再续几天假；并告诉上级家里打算给找对象的事，同时又提出金枝和大凤这两个具体人儿和具体条件来，请上级提些意见。正在这个节骨眼儿，金枝就进来了，笑嘻嘻地象唱歌似的说：
    “哟——大壮哥，刚回来两天就这么抓紧学习哪？”
    “嗯，嗯。”大壮忙把信叠起来，揣在衣袋里，金枝可不在乎那些，上去就抢着要看，嘴里还一边说：“俺们跟你学学哇！”“不，这是封信。”“信俺也得看看。”“是给我们上级写的”。抢了半天，大壮还是没有让她抢去。金枝说：“不让俺看信也罢，可让俺看看钢笔横竖行啊？”大壮递给她说：“这是上级分配给我的胜利品”。金枝拿在手里端详了一会，打开笔帽一看：“还是金笔头哪！要是丢了可怎么办？”“不会，我总是放在口袋里。”“嗯，那可保不住！你看这是什么？”她拿出一个花线的钢笔套，来回的幌荡着，这是她紧着忙着织成的，给他套在钢笔上，然后她把钢笔插进大壮的口袋里。
    娘在外间屋里烧火做饭，门帘子唿嗒唿嗒地，她可看了个一清二楚。哎，大壮这孩子在外边闯荡了这些年，还是那么老老实实的，见了大闺女小媳妇还是那么腼腆，那么守规矩。还不如人家金枝开通哪！这傻孩子……
    大壮因为还没呈请上级批准，对那个可也不表示什么。金枝又拿出一个小戏本来，想让大壮给拍拍谱，其实还没等着看曲调，金枝就说：”俺们还要开晚会欢迎你呢，咱们剧团单为你演戏，看了可给咱提提意见啊！”快晌午了，金枝才走。大壮刚送出门口，正撞见大凤盖地回来，爹吆喝着牲口，大凤走在爹后边，她装着没看见金枝。大壮这小伙子早就想到地里干干活，可是大凤总是悄悄地叫上爹去，不让惊动他，她这么说：“人家成年价摸不着个闲空，让他多歇歇吧。”大壮忙迎着车，卸牲口拿东西，心眼里的感激，直让他连一句客套话也说不出来。正帮着他爹从车上往下收拾饭罐子，猛抬头看见金枝夹着一个本，手里提着两个大麻糖（＠子）正大口小口的咬呢！一蹦一跳的往戏剧团去了。大壮一见，立时扭回脸来，低下头，半天没作声。慢慢地这才又抬起头来，端详了大凤一会…………大凤象在自个儿家里一样，那件家什放在什么地方，她都熟悉，翻箱子倒柜，要个铺衬条儿，她也能找着。收拾停当，安排好，杂面秫面红白条儿的温汤，正出锅，妈给她挑了一碗，奶奶忙给浇上豆芽菜跟仁果豆打的卤子，大凤也没让让这让让那的，端起碗来呼噜呼噜吃完了。大壮一边吃着一边看大凤，不知要跟她说什么才好，半天才说出这么一句：“俺家多亏你……”
    大凤这人可豁亮，没等他说完，就接上说：“俺们这是互助作活，你帮我，我帮你，再说优待军属人人有一份呀……！”
    这句话可是有斤量，重重地落在大壮的心里头了。
    晚上，多热闹的大会呀！会场在村南的学堂里，群众自愿拿出来的花生跟红枣在军属们的手里传来传去，大碗干梨片沏的开水摆在军属大伯大娘的脸前，村长刚讲完话，人们就推推拥拥的把大壮推上了讲台，大家一个劲儿要求他讲讲打仗跟立功的事儿。你听吧，大壮这个年青的军人可就啦起来了。从当战士直到升为团长，那过程太不简单，他越说越多，听的人也越听越有劲，他说：“那一回挂彩是在林冈，那工夫，我还是个排长，剩下最后的一个大岗楼拿不下来，汉奸们挺铁杆，喊话对他们也没有用，手溜弹，小炮弹跟机枪响成一个啦！挖了两天两宿的坑道，因为天下雨敌人又拿手溜弹砸，也塌了！急的团长两眼直冒火，这工夫我从坑道里跳出来，要求抱雷，跑着去，滚着回来，一连抱了三次，我受了伤，可是岗楼可跳了舞了！那一次上级就给我立了一个大功……”全场象开了锅也似的，喊叫鼓掌，闹成一片。金枝大凤不知为什么都挤在最前头来坐下，有几个十三四岁的小闺女们挤眉弄眼净跟金枝逗着玩，还有些小闺女笑嘻嘻地议论着，那些老大娘们也在交头接耳的说道着。郑大壮才讲完，青年委员刘大壮立刻站起来，把脑袋上箍着的手巾使劲一橹，拍着胸脯大声的嚷着：“乡亲们，人家郑大壮这么光荣我刘大壮也不能落后啦！挺头竖脑的大小伙子不比人家少那儿，咱们骑驴看唱本走着瞧，参军那工夫见……”人们又＠嚷一阵，接着村剧团唱了两段“血泪仇”就散会了。
    大壮从这天晚上回去，可闹起思想活动来了。通信员给他捎了封回信来，上级对他这个事没有提出什么意见，只是嘱咐他要找个思想进步又能吃苦耐劳爱作活的才好，并且希望他能挺顺利的成功。他看了这封信可就考虑起来啦！
    倒底谁呢？一个是蹦蹦跳跳，活泼的象个小娃娃；一个呢，老老实实，豁豁亮亮，傻出力气，做起活来象个犍牛……想得脑袋晕了，也有点困了，还不能决定，他慢慢地睡去。在似睡不睡的当儿，一下子信上那“吃苦耐劳爱作活”七个字跳起来了，那盖地耙地，吆喝着牲口的健壮的影子钻进来了，……一下子那水红袄天蓝褂、一蹦一跳的样子，……一下子那大嚼大咽吃麻糖的影子也钻进来啦……唉！
    他一宿没有睡好，第二天一睁眼就巳牌时了。喝了两碗山药白粥，想去街上到处走走看看乡亲们。刚一走到那条东西正街，就看见大凤还跟着个妇女正挨着门的募捐劳军呢，肩膀上脖子上挂满了妇女们做的慰问袋，袋子都鼓绷绷地，装着信和各式各样的吃食，袋子上边绣的什么“打到江南去，解放全中国”呀，什么“战斗英雄人人敬”呀之类的字，五光十色的花线，在太阳底下闪着。大凤还不断地在街上喊着：“参加缝洗组的黑喽都到俺家集合吧。”大壮再也不想到别家串门，扭头就回去了，刚一进去就跟奶奶说：
    “奶奶，我拿定主意啦！”
    过了没几天，金枝吃完早饭，照例也不洗碗也不涮锅，把饭碗一撂，叫声：“娘，我出去一下”，就到街上来了。一走到街上，就听人们嚷嚷欢啦，都说是要道喜去，那些小闺女们一见着她，嘻嘻嘻地就乐；那些小伙子们也跟她逗着玩说：“周金枝，道喜呀！”金枝一听摸不着底细，心里话：准是又逗乐呢，也就笑嘻嘻地回答：“别净拿着别人开心玩，赶到了那工夫，少不了得叫你们热闹一下。”她接着就问：“今个谁家有喜事？”她这一说一问，早把那些青年小伙子们乐的弯不住了，一个最爱逗乐的叫胖怀的说：“怎么大壮他没有取得你的同意，就敢纳贴儿啊？”金枝伸手打了胖怀一下，抿着嘴儿笑着说：“得了吧，净跟人家闹着玩！”胖怀说：“你不信，反正有个叫大壮的，今个纳贴儿。”回过头来，他又向那帮子闺女们问：“你们说是呀不？”闺女们和小伙子们都异口同音的嚷嚷：“谁知道是那个大壮，反正有一个今天准办喜事。”金枝叫人们说的也有点发楞了，寻思着：准是说的青会主任刘大壮。她心里这么想，脚步子可就有点拿不稳了，三脚两步忙着转到郑家的那条过道里来。还没到郑家门口，远远地就看见门前牲口、大车、人，热热闹闹挤满了一大世界，金枝的心里就更慌啦，只听得洛耀大伯忙得满头是汗地从里边出来，大声地嚷着人们说：“都进去歇着吧，乡亲们，咱们道双喜吧，你们看，大壮得了个战斗英雄是一喜，战斗英雄娶了个生产模范，这不是双喜临门吗？”
    一盆冷水把金枝泼了个透心凉，趁着还没人瞅见自己，一扭身就回去了。
    新婚后一星期，大壮又骑了马返回工作岗位了。
