　　American Students Talk About America
　　Bai Sheng
　　Recently, a group of students who returned to Beiping from the United States, including Liu Xitian, Bai Dexiu, Wang Kunren, He Fuzhao, Zhang Daqi, Fu Jufu, Wang Yequ, Zhu Weiheng, Xiao Qianchun, and Qian Baogong, shared some information about the sinful social life of the United States and the political activities of Chinese students in the U.S. The following is a detailed account:

　　Ugly Aspects of American Society
　　Under the rule of monopoly capitalists, the general public in the United States has a very superficial political understanding. People are busy chasing money and rarely sit down to study a problem or two properly. The vast majority of American newspapers are controlled by monopoly capitalists. They publish a large number of women's photos, scandalous news, and advertisements. The New York Times, the Daily Mirror... publish dozens of large pages every day, selling for only one dime each, but very few people actually buy them to read.

　　Propagandists of American imperialism often like to say that Americans enjoy "freedom," "equality," and "democracy." However, people of color in the United States are discriminated against, and the discrimination, abuse, and restrictions faced by Black people are even more severe. In the thirteen southern states of the United States, Black people are restricted to a separate, old train car when traveling by train. Comfortable seats on buses are marked "For Whites Only." A row of very narrow seats at the back is marked "For Colored People." The waiters in hotels are all Black, while the owners are White. Movie theaters and restaurants generally do not allow Black people to enter. When doing the same work in factories, people of color are paid much less than White people. Schools in the southern United States have never allowed Black people to enroll. It is said that this spring, a school in Oklahoma admitted a Black student, who was strictly restricted and could only attend classes in a glass cubicle separated from the White students. White people in the southern United States have an organization called the Ku Klux Klan, which is now very powerful. They specialize in oppressing and murdering Black people. Chinese people in the United States are called "guests" and are also discriminated against in many places. For example, Americans generally do not want to rent houses to Chinese people. Three hundred Chinese students and scientific and technical personnel were interning at Westinghouse Electric Company in Pittsburgh. Everyone went to rent houses separately but was rejected. The Chinese had no choice but to spend money to buy a house. All the procedures had been completed, and they were about to move in, but the American neighbors still unanimously opposed it until the Chinese won the lawsuit before they could move in. When two or three Chinese students speak Chinese in a restaurant, they are sometimes interfered with. In American movies, China is always portrayed as an uncivilized, backward, and barbaric nation. One newspaper published a photo of a Chinese person dressed in rags, with the caption "An Incurable Person," which aroused widespread anger among Chinese students and overseas Chinese.

　　The life of the American bourgeoisie can be described in a few words: highly "promiscuous and shameless." Walking into New York City, you immediately feel like you have entered a world of "money." People only know how to make money, and with money, they have everything. American college students only have three things on their minds after graduation: finding a job to make money, getting women, and getting cars. Under such a sinful social system, many people go crazy. According to official American statistics, New York alone has six mental hospitals, each with an average of about eight thousand mentally ill patients.

　　Political Activities of Chinese Students in the U.S.
　　Chinese students studying in the United States can be roughly divided into three types: one is politically backward, economically wealthy, and does not want to return to China at all; another is completely disappointed in the Kuomintang but still somewhat skeptical of the Communist Party. However, the vast majority have a relatively clear understanding of reality—an understanding of the nature and current situation of the Chinese revolution and have infinite expectations for the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government. They are all prepared to return home after completing their studies and participate in the construction of the new China.

　　Last summer, Chinese students at the general assembly of the "North American Chinese Christian Student Association" passed a resolution supporting the Outline Land Law of China, and also held a meeting at Lake Geneva, Wisconsin, to discuss the New Democracy Theory. This January, Chinese students in New York's International Building performed "Aunt Jiang Mends the Jar" and "Scenes of Jiangnan." The former used the tune of "Aunt Wang Mends the Jar" to describe the fact that Chiang Kai-shek sent Soong Mei-ling to the United States for aid, which was satirized by progressive American public opinion. Soong Mei-ling carried a big dung jar and asked people everywhere in the United States to mend it, but the more it was mended, the more broken it became, to the point where the stench was overwhelming. The latter described the story of the people of Jiangnan warmly welcoming the return of the New Fourth Army. Since this bold performance, Chinese students have begun to widely organize forums to discuss the domestic situation. The New York Chinese New Culture Association has launched united front work. At that time, the only progressive Chinese-run newspaper, the "China Daily News," continuously published editorials from the New China News Agency and important documents of the Chinese Communist Party. In recent months, it has published Comrade Liu Shaoqi's "On Internationalism and Nationalism" and Chairman Mao's "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship." The General Association of Chinese Scientific Workers in the United States was established in New York and held a national congress of Chinese scientific workers in Pittsburgh this June. Membership has increased from two hundred to over four hundred. Since its publication, the "Chinese Students' Communication" has been widely disseminated, publishing news of the victorious advance of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and speeches by Generals Lin Biao and others at certain conferences in Beiping. Chinese students at Columbia and Michigan Universities have also begun to study and discuss Chairman Mao's "On New Democracy" and other works. Gradually, these activities became more open and active. Due to the rapid development of the domestic situation and the great victory of the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people, the Chinese students in the United States have also raised their heads proudly.

　　留美学生谈美国
    柏生
    最近从美国回到北平的留美学生刘锡田、白德修、汪坤仁、何福照、张大奇、傅举孚、王业蘧、朱维衡、萧前椿、钱保功，介绍了一些关于美国罪恶的社会生活和留美学生政治活动的情形，兹分述如下：
    美国社会丑相
    在垄断资本家统治下的美国，一般人的政治认识是非常浮浅的，人们都是为钱奔忙着，很少能好好的坐下来研究一两个问题。美国的报纸绝大部分操纵在垄断资本家的手里。他们把大量的篇幅登载女人照片，桃色新闻和广告。纽约时报、每日镜报……每天出版几十大张，只卖一角美金一份；但是很少有人真正买来阅读。
    美帝国主义的宣传者常常喜欢说美国人的生活“自由”、“平等”、“民主”。但是，美国的有色人种是被歧视的，黑人的受的歧视、虐待和限制更是厉害。在美国南部十三州，黑人坐火车被限制在一辆单独的旧的车厢里。公共汽车上舒适坐位都写着“白人坐的”。后面很窄小的一排位子遭写着“有色人种坐的”。旅馆里的茶房都是黑人，老板则是白人。电影院、餐馆普遍的不许黑人进去。在工厂里作同样的工，有色人种的工资要比白人少得多。美国南部的学校一向不准黑人入学，据说今年春季阿克拉荷马州有一个学校招收了一名黑人学生，他被严格的限制着，只能在和白人隔开的一间玻璃小屋中听课。美国南部的白人有一种三Ｋ党的组织，现在势力很大，他们是专门压迫和谋害黑种人的。中国人在美国被称为“客人”，在许多地方也是被歧视的。例如，美国人总不愿把房子租给中国人住。有三百个中国学生和科学技术人员在匹斯堡西屋电气公司实习，大家分别去租房子，都被拒绝了。中国人没办法，只好花钱买了一所房子。手续都已办清，就要搬进去了，美国邻居还一致反对，直至中国人打官司胜了后，才搬了进去。两三个中国留学生在饭馆里讲中国话，也有时受到干涉的。在美国的电影中，中国总是被描写为没有文化的落后的野蛮民族。有一种报上登载过一张穿着很破烂的中国人的照片，下面写着“不可救药的人”，引起了中国留学生和华侨的普遍愤怒。
    美国资产阶级的生活，可以用几个字来形容；高度的“荒淫无耻”。走进纽约城，立刻会感觉是进了一个“钱”的世界。人们只知道弄钱，有了钱就有了一切。美国大学生一毕业就只有三件事：找职业，从而弄钱；弄女人；弄汽车。在这样罪恶的社会制度下，多少人变成疯子。据美官方统计：仅纽约就有六个疯人医院，每个医院平均都有八千左右个疯人。
    留美学生的政治活动
    在美国留学的中国学生，大致可分为三种：一种是政治上落后，经济上有钱，根本不想回国来的；一种是对国民党完全失望，对共产党还有些观望的。但绝大部分都已比较清醒地认识了现实——认识了中国革命的性质与现状，对中国共产党和人民政府寄予无限的期望。他们都准备学成归国，参加新中国的建设事业。
    去年夏天，中国留学生在“北美中国基督教学生会”全体会员大会上，通过了拥护中国土地法大纲的决议，又在威斯康辛州日内瓦湖开会讨论了新民主主义论。今年一月，留学生在纽约国际大楼演出了“蒋大娘补缸”和“江南小景”。前者是用“王大娘补缸”的调子描写蒋介石派宋美龄去美国求援，被美国进步舆论讽刺的事实。宋美龄背着一个大粪缸，在美国到处请人补，结果愈补愈破，以至臭气薰人。后者是写江南人民热烈欢迎新四军归来的故事。自从这次大胆的演出以后，中国留学生开始广泛地组织座谈会，讨论国内局势。纽约中国新文化协会，开展了统一战线的工作。当时唯一进步的中国人办的报纸——“华侨日报”连续刊登了新华社的社论和中国共产党的重要文献，最近几个月来就登载了刘少奇同志的“论国际主义与民族主义”，毛主席的“论人民民主专政”。留美中国科学工作者协会总会在纽约成立了，今年六月在匹斯堡召开了全美中国科学工作者代表大会，会员由二百人增加到了四百余人。“留美学生通讯”发行以来，传播很广，曾经刊登了中国人民解放军胜利进军的消息，以及林彪等将军在北平某些大会上的演讲。哥伦比亚、密西根等大学的中国留学生，也开始研究讨论毛主席的“新民主主义论”等著作。慢慢地这些活动都公开活跃起来。由于国内局势的迅速发展，中国共产党、中国人民的伟大胜利，使中国留美的学生也都昂然抬起头来了。
