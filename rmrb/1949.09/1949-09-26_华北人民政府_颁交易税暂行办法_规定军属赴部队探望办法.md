　　North China People's Government
  　Issues Interim Measures on Transaction Tax
  　Stipulates Measures for Military Dependents Visiting Troops
    [Ping City News] The North China Region's Interim Measures on Transaction Tax were promulgated and implemented by the North China People's Government on the 22nd of this month. According to the provisions of these measures, all transactions of livestock, grain, cotton, and cloth conducted in towns, markets, and villages within the region shall be subject to transaction tax in accordance with the law, unless otherwise specified. The following provisions are also made: 1. In cities such as Beiping, Tianjin, Shijiazhuang, Tangshan, Zhangjiakou, and Taiyuan, where transaction conditions are complex, the issue of levying taxes on transactions of items other than livestock shall be determined by each city, which shall submit its opinions to the North China Government for approval by October 15th before implementation. 2. The collection of transaction taxes on cotton and homespun cloth shall be limited to areas where cotton and cloth are produced or distributed in large quantities and where there is a custom of paying taxes. The specific locations shall be determined by each provincial government and submitted to the North China Government for approval before implementation. Upon the promulgation of these Interim Measures on Transaction Tax for the North China Region, all existing single-item measures on transaction tax in various localities shall be repealed.

    [This Newspaper] Regarding the troops stationed in North China, measures have already been taken to allow soldiers to return home for reunions, under the principle of not hindering military training. However, recently, a large number of military dependents have been visiting relatives in the troops, many of whom have not been formally introduced by the county government or do not hold any proof of procedure, and some are requesting travel expenses along the way. In order to facilitate the handling of these issues, avoid delaying production, wasting money, and affecting the work of the troops, the North China People's Government has instructed county governments that, in addition to politely dissuading general visitors, those who have special reasons to visit the troops should be educated to pay attention to the season and production, ascertain the troops' location in advance, and obtain a formal letter of introduction from the county government before proceeding. Travel expenses shall be borne by the military dependents themselves; those who encounter difficulties during their journey may be given appropriate assistance from preferential treatment grain, which shall be noted on their documents. In the future, if anyone requests subsidies for travel expenses as a military dependent along the way to governments at all levels without holding any documents, they shall not be accepted.

    【本报讯】关于驻防华北部队，于不妨碍练兵原则下，已有照顾军人回家团聚的措施；但近来军属到部队探望亲属者甚多，且多未经本县县府正式介绍或未持任何证明手续，有的沿途要求路费。华北人民政府为了便于处理这些问题，避免耽误生产、浪费金钱、影响部队工作起见，顷指示各县政府，除对一般探望者婉言劝阻外，其个别有特殊原因必须去部队者，应教育其注意季节与生产，并事先查明部队驻地，由县府开具正式介绍信，然后前往。路费则由军属自筹；其个别在行途中遭遇困难者，可从优军粮中酌情补助，惟须于其所持证件上注明。今后如未持任何证件，而沿途到各级政府请求按军属补助路费者，一概不得受理。
