Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 2nd: A summary of TASS dispatches: After the Soviet government issued another note to the Yugoslav government on the Austrian issue on August 29th, newspapers in Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Albania, Denmark, Sweden, Finland, France, Italy, England, Holland, Australia, India, and other countries prominently published the full text or detailed summaries of the note on August 31st. Radio stations in The Hague, Holland, Damascus, Syria, and Beirut, Lebanon, rebroadcast summaries of the note. Progressive public opinion around the world unanimously expressed that the Soviet note provided the best and most powerful exposure of the true face of the Tito clique of traitors. Polish newspapers headlined that the Soviet Union protects the interests of the Yugoslav people from being sold out by the Tito clique. Czech newspapers stated: The Soviet note exposed the mask of the Tito clique and was an appropriate response to the Yugoslav government's spreading of lies and slander. The Hungarian "Népszava" newspaper's August 31st headline stated: On the issue of Slovenian Carinthia, the actions of the Yugoslav government are like those of a lackey of the imperialist bloc. The French Communist Party's "L'Humanité" published an article titled "The Exposed Provocateurs," stating: The purpose of the Soviet government's note is not to persuade a few faithless traitors in the socialist camp who act on the orders of warmongers, but to expose to the vast Yugoslav people, even those who have difficulty knowing outside news, the true nature of the Yugoslav government as an enemy and opponent of the Soviet Union and a spy of the foreign imperialist bloc. The Italian Communist Party's "L'Unità" stated: The Soviet note provided solid evidence of the Tito clique's double-dealing, proving the Soviet Union's consistent defense of the right to national self-determination. The Australian Communist Party's organ, "Tribune," editorialized: "The Soviet note to the Yugoslav government completely exposed the Tito regime as a group that betrayed the cause of democracy and socialism and sided with foreign capital and the reactionary camp. The Tito clique is truly selling out Yugoslavia's national independence and placing the national economy under the control of foreign capital, thus preparing the country for imperialist use as a war base to attack the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries." Sharkey, the General Secretary of the Australian Communist Party, wrote in the "Tribune" that the traitor Tito and his running dogs are not leading the Yugoslav people towards socialism, but are dragging them back to capitalism. The Tito regime has degenerated into a fascist rule, using all means of terror to suppress the revolutionary working class who are fighting against capitalist restoration. Hundreds of people have been murdered, including many outstanding leaders like Jovanović. In order to obtain the support of the imperialists for the Tito regime, the Yugoslav government secretly colluded with them and cancelled its claim to Carinthia. The Information Bureau and Communist Parties around the world condemned the Yugoslav Communist Party, and Communist Parties around the world declared that Yugoslav Communists must expel these rebellious leaders and restore their party to the foundations of Marxism-Leninism. Communist Parties around the world believe that overthrowing the Tito clique is the task of the Yugoslav workers and genuine Communists.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 2nd: TASS New York, August 31st: George Vujnovich, publisher of the Pittsburgh Weekly Report and former U.S. Army Captain and war hero, wrote in a recent issue of the magazine, denouncing Tito as a lackey of Wall Street and predicting that Tito's efforts to isolate Yugoslavia from other Slavic nations would surely fail. Vujnovich's ancestral home is Serbia, and his grandfather was a leader in the Serbian struggle against Turkish oppression. He himself fought with the Yugoslav guerrillas in 1943-44. He wrote: The Tito clique "has led Yugoslavia down a dead end, and the national economy is constantly declining in comparison with the situation of its Slavic brother countries." Vujnovich expressed his firm belief that "Tito's efforts to sell out Yugoslavia are bound to fail." He said: "I believe that the people of Yugoslavia will certainly not allow themselves to be put together with those armed, feudal Turkish guys. Tito has become a terrorist dictator. The politically experienced people of Yugoslavia know how to eliminate such rulers."

　　世界进步舆论拥护苏联照会认为南共党员必能赶走叛徒
  　美匹兹堡一周汇报指出铁托定将失败
    【新华社北平二日电】综合塔斯社消息：苏联政府于八月二十九日再次发表致南斯拉夫政府关于对奥问题的照会以后，波、捷、匈、罗、保、阿尔巴尼亚、丹麦、瑞典、芬兰、法、意、英、荷、澳、印度等国的报纸，均于八月三十一日以显著地位刊载照会全文或详细摘要，海牙、荷兰的叙利亚的大马士革，黎巴嫩的贝鲁特电台并转播了照会摘要。全世界进步舆论，一致表示苏联照会对铁托集团叛徒的真面目，作了最好和最有力的揭发。波兰各报标题指出苏联保护南斯拉夫人民利益，免为铁托集团出卖。捷各报称：苏联照会揭穿了铁托集团的假面具，是对散播谎言与诽谤的南斯拉夫政府的恰当回答。匈牙利涅普·斯查瓦报八月三十一日的标题称：在斯洛文族加林西亚问题上，南斯拉夫政府的行动，如同帝国主义集团的走狗。法共人道报以“被暴露了的挑拨者”发表论文称：苏联政府的照会，目的不在说服几个没有信仰而奉战争贩子之命行事的社会主义阵营的叛徒，照会是要向广大的、甚至很难得知外界消息的南斯拉夫人民，揭露南斯拉夫政府作为苏联的敌人和反对者，及外国帝国主义者集团的奸细的真实本质。意共团结报称：苏联照会对铁托集团的两面手法，提供了确凿的证据，证明了苏联一贯保卫民族自决权。澳共机关报论坛报社论称：“苏联致南政府的照会，完全暴露了铁托政权是背叛民主与社会主义事业和投靠外国资本和反动阵营的一个集团。铁托集团真正是在出卖南斯拉夫的国家独立和置南国经济于外国资本的控制之下，这样来准备将国家供帝国主义利用作进攻苏联与人民民主国家的战争基地。”澳大利亚共产党总书记夏基在论坛报上撰文评称：叛徒铁托及其走狗，不是领导南斯拉夫人民走向社会主义，而是将他们拖回到资本主义。铁托政权已堕落成为法西斯主义的统治，它使用一切恐怖手段，来镇压正在为反对资本主义复辟而斗争的革命的工人阶级。被谋杀的人数以百计，中其包括许多象尤伐诺维区这样卓越的领袖。南斯拉夫政府为了取得帝国主义者对铁托政权的支持，背地和他们勾结，取消了对加林西亚的要求。情报局与世界各国共产党斥责南斯拉夫共产党，各国共产党宣称：南斯拉夫共产党人必须驱逐这些叛逆的领袖，将他们的党重新置于马克思主义列宁主义的基础之上。各国共产党认为推翻铁托集团是南斯拉夫工人和真正的共产党人的任务。
    【新华社北平二日电】塔斯社纽约八月三十一日讯：匹兹堡一周汇报发行人前美军上尉战斗英雄乔治·伍奇尼克在最近一期该刊中，著文斥责铁托为华尔街的从仆，并预言铁托把南斯拉夫与其他斯拉夫民族隔离开来的努力一定失败。伍奇尼克祖籍塞尔维亚，祖父是塞尔维亚反对土耳其压迫斗争中的一位领袖，他本人在一九四三——四四年曾与南斯拉夫的游击队在一起作战。他写道：铁托集团“已经把南斯拉夫引上了绝路，南国的经济和它的斯拉夫民族兄弟国的情形对比起来，是在不断地降低着。”伍奇尼克表示深信：“铁托出卖南斯拉夫的努力一定失败”。他说：“我相信，南斯拉夫的人民一定不容许把他们自己和那些武装的封建的土耳其的家伙们撮合在一起。铁托已经变成恐怖主义的专制魔王。富有政治经验的南斯拉夫人民是懂得怎样消灭这类统治者的。”
