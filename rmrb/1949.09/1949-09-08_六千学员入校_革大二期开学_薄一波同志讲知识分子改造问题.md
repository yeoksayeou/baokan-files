　　Six Thousand Students Enter School
  　Second Phase of Revolutionary University Begins
  　Comrade Bo Yibo Speaks on the Transformation of Intellectuals
    [Our Newspaper] The opening ceremony for the second phase of the North China People's Revolutionary University was solemnly held at the West Playground at 3:00 PM on the 5th. Over six thousand new students and all school staff members participated. Comrade Bo Yibo, Secretary of the North China Bureau of the CCP Central Committee, personally attended and delivered a speech. At approximately 3:00 PM, the ceremony began amidst music. After everyone stood and sang "The Internationale," President Liu Lantao gave a brief speech. He pointed out that although our courses are many, they can be summarized as one: to establish a revolutionary outlook on life of serving the people. Following this, Comrade Bo Yibo spoke, addressing the issue of the transformation of intellectuals. He first pointed out that intellectuals are very valuable in China because they can play a significant bridging role in the revolution. However, this does not mean that intellectuals are certain to play this revolutionary role. The key lies in whether they integrate with the workers and peasants. Comrade Bo Yibo used actual examples from modern Chinese history, especially the divergence of intellectuals along two lines after the May Fourth Movement, to confirm this truth. Finally, he earnestly explained that the most important thing for intellectuals to transform themselves well is to have an honest attitude, not to pretend or boast, and to be pragmatic. Comrade Bo Yibo's patient and earnest guidance fully demonstrated the Party's sincere concern for intellectuals. Comrade Nie Zhen, representative of North China University, said in his speech that he hoped everyone would study hard, correctly grasp the proletarian stance, viewpoints, and methods, and learn to serve the people. Comrade Ma Shike, an electrician, delivered a congratulatory message on behalf of the school workers, hoping that the students would study hard. Finally, representatives of the first and second departments delivered reply speeches, unanimously expressing their determination to study hard, improve their theoretical level, transform themselves, and repay the Party's care with practical actions. At this point, the ceremony ended in cheers. Evening parties were held at three locations in the evening. (Jiang Han)

　　六千学员入校
  　革大二期开学
  　薄一波同志讲知识分子改造问题
    【本报讯】华北人民革命大学第二期开学典礼于五日下午三时在西操场隆重举行。六千余新学员及全校工作人员均参加。中共中央华北局书记薄一波同志亲临讲话。三时许，仪式于乐声中开始。全体起立唱“国际歌”后，校长刘澜涛同志作简短致词。指出：我们的课程虽然很多，归纳起来也可以说是一种，即：确定为人民服务的革命人生观。继由薄一波同志讲话，针对知识分子的改造问题，他首先指出：在中国，知识分子是很可宝贵的。因为他们对革命可以起重大的桥梁作用。但这不是说知识分子就一定能起这种革命作用，关键在于是否与工农群众相结合。一波同志用中国近代史的实际事例，特别是“五四”以后知识分子两条路线的分化情形证实这一真理。最后又恳切的说明：知识分子要想改造好，最重要的是要有老老实实的态度，不装不吹，实事求是。一波同志这种耐心的谆谆教导，充分表现了党对知识分子的热诚关注。华北大学代表聂真同志讲话中，希望大家努力学习，正确掌握无产阶级的立场、观点和方法，学会为人民服务。电工马世科同志代表校工致贺词，希望同学们好好学习。最后由一部、二部的学员代表致答词，一致表示：努力学习，提高理论水平，改造自己，以实际行动答谢党的爱护。至此，典礼于欢呼声中结束。晚间分三处举行晚会。（江寒）
