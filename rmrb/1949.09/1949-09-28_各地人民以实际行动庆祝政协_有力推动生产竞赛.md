　　【Our Newspaper Dispatches】The upsurge of people across the country celebrating the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) and preparing to celebrate the founding of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China is increasing even more, and is increasingly becoming a huge driving force for promoting production.
　　More than 30 units in Shanghai, including the Postal Workers' Union, Telecommunications Bureau, China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, shipyards, Guangzhong Weaving Factory, Xiefeng Dyeing Factory, Daming Match Factory, and the hardware industry, have been actively preparing to celebrate the opening of the CPPCC and welcome the International Day of Struggle for Peace in recent days. More than a thousand postal workers have guaranteed to complete the task of supporting the front lines. Various factories of the Central Machine Company celebrated the opening of the CPPCC and accepted a three-month sprint to complete the glorious production plan of 30 engines. Workers Yang Quangen and Wang Afu from a branch factory of the company called on all workers to study Mao Zedong Thought diligently, actively engage in production, learn from model workers, and strive to complete the three-month production plan in two months to celebrate the birth of the new People's China. Workers at the clothing factory guaranteed to complete the task of more than one million sets of winter clothing assigned by their superiors on time and as early as possible, so that the People's Liberation Army could wear cotton-padded clothes, quickly and thoroughly eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, liberate all of China, and defend world peace.
　　When representatives of labor heroes from the Tianjin North Railway Station Locomotive Depot held a symposium, they unanimously proposed to increase production to complete the construction tasks of the new China. Workers at Tanggu New Port resolutely stated at the celebration meeting: They would take a master's attitude and quickly repair New Port, the only seaport in North China, to break through the enemy's blockade and spread the voice of the people's peace to the world. Gu Huiming of the Municipal Enterprise Rubber Factory cited the example of the employees of the Public Bus Management Office modifying charcoal vehicles to replace gasoline vehicles, hoping that everyone would learn from the employees of that office to overcome the current material difficulties and crush the enemy's blockade. At a celebration meeting of 2,000 workers held by the Municipal Enterprise Trade Union, a production competition was launched on the spot, starting with the guarantee of workers at the power plant to send electricity to Beijing during the CPPCC meeting as a challenge, which aroused the enthusiastic responses from trolleybus companies, automobile transportation companies, the Municipal Water Plant, the Public Works Bureau, the Haihe River Project Office, the Telecommunications Bureau, the French Power Company, the Ji'an Water Company, cleaning teams, and fertilizer carriers, and they announced the conditions for each unit's response. Workers from the fine wire section, coarse wire section, washing section, mother screw section, electrical department, and repair department of Tianjin Steel Plant No. 2 even proposed to voluntarily work overtime for half an hour to two hours every day from the 22nd to the 27th. Bricklayer Xie Liancheng said, "We are the masters of the new China. Today is a happy event for ourselves, and we are willing to work harder." Tianjin Daily has increased its supplements for several days in a row. The work of the general staff of the entire agency has increased by more than 50% compared with usual, but the workers are unusually excited and nervous, striving to report every news item as quickly as possible. More than 100 workers from the 8th and 9th District Engineering Office of the Public Works Bureau, who are repairing roads, enthusiastically launched a labor competition yesterday, and decided to complete all the repairs on North Road within three days. Trolleybus management workers plan to renovate dilapidated trolleybuses transported from Shanghai into new trolleybuses in just ten days. They shortened the time by half to complete this task to celebrate the opening of the CPPCC. This trolleybus has been named "CPPCC" and runs through the city every day with bright red colors. Workers at the Public Bus Management Office also completed two large buses that would have taken two or three months to assemble in half a month as a gift to celebrate the opening of the CPPCC.
　　Nanchang Private Xinye Yarn Factory launched a production sprint on the 23rd, producing more than 800 pounds of yarn in twelve hours, exceeding two-thirds of the usual output.
　　Zhengzhou Longping Railway Locomotive Depot increased its plan to repair 80 locomotives in September to 100 locomotives.
