Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 25th: TASS, Paris, 24th: "The Nation's Forum" publishes an article by its special correspondent in Rangoon on American expansion in Southeast Asia. According to the correspondent: Negotiations between British High Commissioner for Southeast Asia, MacDonald, and representatives of the U.S. State Department will result in large quantities of rubber and tin produced in Malaya being shipped to the United States as strategic materials for storage. Several tin mines and rubber plantations will be directly exploited by American companies. The American Smelting Company is already mining tin in the states of Perak and Selangor, and has installed mineral refining equipment in Singapore and Perak. American monopoly capitalists have also taken over large rubber plantations in the former British regions of Pahang, Negeri Sembilan, and Sungei Ujong. Iron ore in the states of Johor, Terengganu, and Kelantan is also being mined. Furthermore, "American Smelting Company" and "American Rolling Mill Company" have obtained mining rights to Burmese mineral deposits. "Mobil Oil," controlled by Rockefeller, is gradually squeezing out the Burma Oil Company. Currently, many representatives from General Motors, Ford, Interridge, and other automobile companies are in Rangoon. The United States is also demanding the establishment of a military base in Akyab, Burma. In Borneo, the United States has begun to exploit oil fields and rubber plantations in the Miri region of Sarawak. They are also mining coal, oil, iron ore, and exploiting forests in northwestern Borneo. Currently, almost all of British Borneo's rubber (about 50 percent or more of the region's exports) is shipped to the United States. The United States is showing increasing interest in Jesselton Port, the railway terminus leading to the interior of Borneo.

　　美帝加紧侵略东南亚
  　企图在缅甸建立军事基地
    掠取大批橡胶锡运往国内
    【新华社北平二十五日电】塔斯社巴黎二十四日讯：民族论坛报发表其驻仰光特派记者关于美国在东南亚扩张的论文。据该记者称：英国驻东南亚高级专员麦克唐纳和美国务院代表之间的谈判，将使大量马来亚生产的橡胶和锡输往美国，作为战略物资存储。若干锡矿和橡树园将直接由美国公司开采。美国熔炼公司已经在霹雳州和雪兰峨的锡矿中进行开采，并在新加坡和霹雳州装置了炼矿的设备。美国垄断资本家也已经染指于以前属于英国的巴安、尼格里和森美兰地区的大橡树园。柔佛、丁加奴和吉连丹地区的铁矿，也被开采了。此外，“美国熔炼公司”和“美国辗铁厂”已获得缅甸矿藏的开采权。洛克菲勒控制的“美孚公司”正逐渐在排挤缅甸石油公司。目前通用、福特、因特里奇以及其他汽车公司的许多代表，都在仰光。美国又要求在缅甸的阿恰布，建立军事基地。在婆罗洲，美国在沙拉瓦克的米里地区，已开始开采油田和橡树园。他们又在婆罗洲的西北部开采煤矿、油田、铁矿和森林。目前英属婆罗洲的全部橡胶（约占该地出口百分之五十以上），几乎都是输往美国。美国对于通往婆罗洲内地的铁路终点——哲塞尔敦港，表现得越来越感兴趣。
