  　Shooting Hero Wei Laiguo

    Lin Hong

    "Gorky used his pen to fight the enemy, and you use your gun. You are both the most glorious people!" Comrade Wei Laiguo gloriously attended the World Labor Youth Congress held in Warsaw, the capital of Poland, in 1948. On his way back home, he passed by the Stalin Workers' University in Moscow, where students gave him a beautiful statue of Gorky and said the above sentence to him. Today, our shooting hero Wei Laiguo has arrived in the people's capital again to attend the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. What an honor for him! When the reporter met him, he said with great emotion: "Without the wise leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, a soldier from a poor peasant family like me would never have the opportunity to participate in the Political Consultative Conference representing the people of the whole country. I probably wouldn't even have the chance to enter Beijing. The Communist Party will never bury talent!"

    Wei Laiguo is only twenty-five years old this year. He grew up in a poor peasant family in Rongcheng County, Shandong Province. At the age of sixteen, due to the difficult family life and the devastation and oppression of the Japanese invaders, he became an apprentice to a mud mason. At the same time, he joined the Youth Anti-Japanese Vanguard team led by the Chinese Communist Party at that time, cooperating with the main force to fight against the Japanese devils. In 1942, he was transferred from the Shidao Brigade, a local armed force in the Jiaodong Liberated Area, to the Rongcheng County Independent Battalion in Jiaodong, and from then on, he began to live a strict military life. He liked shooting, and in the second target practice in the Independent Battalion, he hit the four rings with two shots. He was very excited about this unexpected result, so he vowed to train himself to be an excellent shooter. In 1944, he went to the Jiaodong Naval District Training Team to receive shooting training. He listened attentively to every lesson, recited the essentials of shooting whenever he had time, and practiced shooting techniques with a gun. In a battle after the training, he killed six enemies, and the hard study initially achieved excellent results. Soon after, in a live ammunition shooting, he hit twenty-one rings with three shots, and was immediately selected as the battalion's special shooter and participated in the Jiaodong Military Region's military technology competition on the October Revolution Day. In 1945, he received another month of shooting training, and he learned to use a surveyor to determine the deviation of the gun, and his shooting skills quickly improved, and he soon became an excellent shooter.

    At the end of June 1946, Chiang Kai-shek's 54th Army attacked Jimo and advanced along the Jiaoji Railway to Nanquan Station. At this time, Wei Laiguo was already a platoon leader, guarding the Nanquan Donglangezhuang position. With his accurate shooting skills and brave and calm command, he killed more than forty enemies in one go, and successively killed six or seven enemy commanders, finally repelling the attack of an enemy column. After the Nanquan Blocking Battle, Wei Laiguo won the glorious title of Shandong Shooting Hero, and the whole army launched the Wei Laiguo shooting movement. At this time, he had been promoted to company commander, and the fourth company he led quickly joined the wave of this movement. Under his command, the shooting skills of the entire company improved at an alarming rate, with two Zhu De shooters with more than twenty-eight rings in three shots, six special shooters with more than twenty-six rings in three shots, and twenty-seven ordinary shooters.

    In mid-April 1947, Chiang Kai-shek launched a key offensive against Shandong with eighty brigades. In order to cooperate with the battle to capture Tai'an and annihilate Chiang Kai-shek's 72nd Army, our army held Baima Pass, preventing Chiang Kai-shek's 11th Division from occupying Mengyin City according to the plan. High mountains stood on both sides of Baima Pass, with a highway passing through the middle, and Heishan and Yuntou Mountain as barriers in front. The company of hero Wei Laiguo was guarding the Heishan position. On April 20, Chiang Kai-shek's army attacked the Heishan position with a battalion of troops, and one enemy after another fell under Wei Laiguo's gun. When the enemy occupied Tiantai Mountain in front of Heishan, the enemies gathered on the top of the mountain. He shot a few shots, and several enemy soldiers immediately rolled down from the rocks. A soldier on the right side kept saying: The company commander shoots really well! Heishan was once occupied, and Wei Laiguo led the entire company to charge the enemy and regain the lost position. In the two battles, he alone killed ninety-two enemies.

    When the reporter met Comrade Wei Laiguo, the Huaihai Campaign Medal on his chest shone brightly, and he was honored to see his hero medal taken out; after the Nanquan Blocking Battle, he was selected as the Shandong Shooting Hero and received the first combat hero medal. In the Baima Pass battle in 1947, he was awarded the First Class Merit Medal for killing ninety-two enemies. The other one is a First Class People's Hero Medal. It was awarded by the East China Field Army to commemorate his killing and wounding of more than 360 enemies in the past three years. These shining medals are a glorious record of his heroic deeds!

    Last year, when attending the World Labor Youth Congress in Poland, Wei Laiguo was warmly welcomed and loved by young people from all countries. A reporter from the Polish Central News Agency interviewed his heroic deeds and published a special article in the newspaper. He was often surrounded by groups of young men and women, asking him to tell the story of preparing to shoot the enemy; everyone also regarded it as an honor to take pictures with Wei Laiguo.

    When the reporter finally asked about his family situation, he said with a smile: In the past, under the oppression of the Japanese invaders and the Kuomintang, it was not easy for a family of three to even eat; since the land was distributed, life has been getting better day by day.

　　中国人民政协代表访问记
  　射击英雄魏来国
    林洪
    “高尔基用笔打敌人，你用枪杆打敌人，你们都是最光荣的人１魏来国同志于一九四八年光荣地出席在波兰首都华沙召开的世界劳动青年代表大会，在回国途中路经莫斯科斯大林工人大学时，学生们送给他一个美丽的高尔基石像，并对他说了上面的一句话，今天我们的射击英雄魏来国又到了人民的首都，出席中国人民政治协商会议，他是多么的荣幸啊！当记者会见他时，他十分感动地说：“要没有共产党和毛主席英明的领导，象我这样一个贫苦农家出身的军人，那儿有机会参加代表全国人民的政治协商会议，恐怕连进北京城也没有可能。共产党是不会埋没人材的！”
    魏来国今年刚刚二十五岁，生长在山东荣成县一个贫农的家庭，十六岁时因家庭生活困苦，难以维持，再加上日寇的摧残压迫，他便在一个泥水匠那里当学徒，同时加入了当时中国共产党所领导的青年抗日先锋队，配合主力军，抗击日本鬼子。一九四二年，从胶东解放区的地方武装石岛大队调到胶东荣成县独立营，从此便开始过着严格的军人生活。他喜好打枪，在独立营第二次打靶时，两枪打中了四环，他为这意外的成绩而异常兴奋，因此立志要把自己锻炼成一个优良的射击手。一九四四年他到胶东海军分区教导队受射击训练，每次上课都专心倾听，一有空就背诵射击要领，并用枪实际锻炼射击技术姿势。在受训后的一次作战中，他打死六个敌人，苦学的结果初次获得了优良的成绩；不久之后，在一次实弹射击中，他又三枪中了二十一环，立刻便被选为营的特等射击手，参加了十月革命节胶东军区的军事技术大竞赛。一九四五年又受了一个月的射击训练，他学会用测定器测定枪的偏差，他的射击技术便迅速地提高起来，不久就成了一个出色的射击手。
    一九四六年六月底，蒋匪五十四军进攻即墨并沿胶济线向南泉车站进攻，这时魏来国已当排长，坚守着南泉东兰格庄阵地，凭着他百发百中的射击技术和英勇沉着的指挥，一口气打死四十多个敌人，先后击毙六、七个敌人的指挥官，终于击退了敌人一个纵队的进攻。南泉阻击战结束后，魏来国便荣膺山东射击英雄的光荣称号，全军展开了魏来国射击运动，这时他已升任连长，他所领导的第四连很快地卷入这一运动的浪潮中。在他的指挥下，全连的射击技术以惊人的速度向上提高，出现了两名三枪中二十八环以上的朱德射击手、六名三枪中二十六环以上的特等射击手和普通射击手二十七名。
    一九四七年四月中旬，蒋匪以八十个旅向山东作重点进攻，我军为配合攻克泰安歼灭蒋匪七十二军的战斗，某团坚守白马关，不让蒋匪十一师按预定计划占领蒙阴城。白马关两边高山屹立，中间有公路穿过，前面有黑山，云头山作屏障，英雄魏来国的连队正坚守着黑山阵地。四月二十日蒋匪军以一营兵力向黑山阵地进攻，在魏来国的枪下一个接一个的敌人倒下了。当敌人占领黑山前的天台山时，敌人蜂集山头，被他打了几枪，几个敌军立刻从岩石上滚下，在右旁边的一位战士连称：连长打得真好！黑山曾一度被占，魏来国率全连向敌冲锋，重新夺回已失阵地。两次战斗，他一人就击毙了敌人九十二名。
    记者见到魏来国同志的时候，他胸前挂着的淮海战役纪念章，闪闪地发着光，并且荣幸地看到他的英雄奖章拿了出来；南泉阻击战后，他被选为山东射击英雄，得到第一枚战斗英雄奖章，一九四七年白马关战役中，因杀敌九十二人，再荣膺一等功奖章，另外还有一枚是一级人民英雄章。是华东野战军纪念他三年多来杀伤敌人三百六十余人而颁发的。这一些金光耀眼的奖章正是他英雄事迹的光辉纪录！
    去年在波兰出席世界劳动青年大会时，魏来国受到各国青年热情的欢迎与爱戴，波兰中央社记者特采访他的英勇事迹，并在报上专题发表。他时时被成群的男女青年包围，要他讲述准备射击敌人的故事；大家并以和魏来国一起照像为荣耀。
    当记者最后问到他的家庭情况时，他笑嘻嘻地说：过去受日寇和国民党的压迫，一家三口人连吃饭都不容易；自从分了地，生活已一天天好起来了。
