Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 3rd—The temporary construction workers of the private Yongli Chemical Company Alkali Plant in Tanggu, Tianjin, insisted on being converted to permanent workers or continued employment when the oral contract agreed upon by labor and management was about to expire, leading to a dispute with the employer. The Municipal Labor Bureau legally arbitrated the dispute and decided to handle it according to the contract provisions.

Eighty-three plasterers, including Hou Shuzhang, Guo Yunxiao, and Zheng Liwen, were hired by the Yongli Alkali Plant in April of last year to build dormitories for the plant. Later, due to the war, the project could not continue, and the employer dismissed them on December 7 of last year after paying them half a month's wages in advance. After the liberation of Tanggu, the workers requested to resume work. After negotiation between the Tanggu District Federation of Trade Unions, the Yongli Temporary Workers' Representatives Meeting, representatives of the workers, and representatives of the employer, an oral contract was agreed upon on February 26, stating that the employer would continue to hire them, but for a maximum of two terms, each term being three months, with the contract period from March 1st to the end of August. However, in late May, the temporary construction workers of the plant again demanded that the employer convert them to permanent workers or continue to sign employment contracts after the original contract expired, while the employer believed that they should be dismissed after the contract expired, thus causing a dispute.

After the dispute occurred, the Tanggu District Federation of Trade Unions explained to the construction workers that the union would naturally be willing to help everyone find employment. Before this incident, they had already helped eighty-one of the temporary workers, including skilled and ordinary workers, to negotiate with the employer to become permanent workers. However, plasterers are construction workers, different from other temporary workers, and had a six-month oral contract. If they do not fulfill the contract and force the employer to continue to hire them, it may cause concerns among capitalists, who may not dare to hire workers in the future, thus affecting everyone's employment opportunities and being detrimental to the development of production. Regarding the livelihood problem after dismissal, the union also explained that it would do its best to help solve it, planning to raise funds from the plant's permanent workers to establish a labor cooperative to find contracting work for them. At the same time, the Municipal Labor Bureau also repeatedly persuaded the workers. Zhou Kegang, director of the Tanggu Military Control Sub-Committee, convened a meeting of plasterers on the 19th of last month, expressing sympathy for everyone's concerns about unemployment, but advised everyone to listen to the union, organize labor cooperatives, and solve the unemployment problem. However, under the instigation and coercion of a few radical individuals such as Hou, Guo, and Zheng, some workers insisted on the above unreasonable demands, and the dispute fell into a stalemate.

On August 21, representatives of the employer and representatives of the workers applied to the Tianjin Municipal People's Government Labor Bureau for arbitration. The Municipal Labor Bureau organized an arbitration committee, with Lin Chao, Deputy Director of the Bureau, as the director, to conduct arbitration. After listening to the facts presented by both labor and management and allowing both sides to debate, the committee announced its arbitration opinion on the spot: According to the policy of "both labor and management benefit, develop production," since labor and management have an agreement, the employer can freely hire or dismiss workers depending on whether it is needed for work when the contract expires. Therefore, the employer's application was approved, and the employment relationship between the two parties was terminated from August 31, 1949, without any conditions attached. In addition to announcing that the arbitration award would be sent to both labor and management within three days, the arbitration committee explained that if either party disagreed with the arbitration award after receiving it, they must file a lawsuit with the People's Court within five days to request a judgment, otherwise the arbitration decision would have legal effect; at the same time, it was declared that before the contract expires, the employer shall not dismiss or reduce the workers' wages casually; the workers shall not engage in strikes or sabotage production.

Also: Prior to this, the temporary workers other than the plasterers in the Yongli Alkali Plant demanded to be converted to permanent workers and have their treatment adjusted because the Yongli Alkali Plant employer had many unreasonable phenomena in the division of permanent workers, short-term workers, and temporary workers, such as many of the 240-50 temporary workers in the entire plant being employed for a long time, doing the same work as permanent workers, but their wages were only about one-fifth of the permanent workers' wages, and they had no welfare benefits. After careful consideration by the Tianjin Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, it was considered that the workers' demands were reasonable and should be actively supported. After reaching an agreement with the employer, a total of eighty-one workers, including those who were permanent workers in the plant before the Anti-Japanese War and skilled and ordinary workers among the temporary workers who held long-term fixed jobs, were reassigned as permanent workers, and the wages of the remaining 169 temporary workers were also appropriately adjusted. Labor and management signed a collective contract on August 5, and the dispute was satisfactorily resolved.

Labor Bureau Arbitration Award

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 3rd—The arbitration award of the Tianjin Municipal People's Government Labor Bureau on the labor dispute of the Yongli Company Alkali Plant was delivered to labor and management on August 28. The full text of the arbitration award is as follows:

Applicant: Representative of the employer of the Yongli Chemical Company Alkali Plant
Title: Deputy Director, Name: Zhong Zi璜, Address: Staff dormitory of the Yongli Alkali Plant in Tanggu

Respondent: Representative of the temporary construction workers of the Yongli Chemical Company Alkali Plant
Title: Worker, Name: Hou Shuzhang, Address: Workers' dormitory of the Yongli Alkali Plant in Tanggu

Regarding the labor contract dispute between the employer of the Yongli Chemical Company Alkali Plant and the temporary construction workers, after the arbitration committee of this bureau summoned both parties, the arbitration is now as follows:

I. Arbitration Ruling

Hou Shuzhang, Guo Yunxiao, Zheng Liwen, and other eighty-three people are temporary construction workers (plasterers) of the Yongli Chemical Company Alkali Plant. After liberation, the workers requested to resume work. After negotiation between labor and management, an oral contract of two terms totaling six months was agreed upon. The employer proposed to terminate the contract after the contract expired based on production needs. After investigation and confirmation, the arbitration committee, based on the principle that neither party should be forced to employ or be employed when either party is unwilling to continue after the contract expires, approved the employer's application: The employment relationship between the two parties shall be terminated from August 31, 1949, according to the contract, without any conditions attached.

II. Facts and Reasons

First, according to the employer's complaint, Hou Shuzhang, Guo Yunxiao, Zheng Liwen, and other eighty-three temporary construction workers were dismissed on December 7, 1948, due to the war and were paid half a month's wages in advance. After the liberation of Tanggu, the workers requested to resume work. After negotiation between the Tanggu District Federation of Trade Unions, the Yongli Temporary Workers' Representatives Meeting, representatives of the workers, and representatives of the employer, a temporary oral contract was agreed upon on March 26, stating that each term would be three months, totaling two terms, from March 1 of the same year to August. There is a record of the agreement for this oral contract, and both parties have in fact fulfilled it during this period, so it cannot be considered that the contract is invalid.

Second, the workers are construction workers (plasterers), belonging to the nature of civil engineering temporary workers, and are different from the workers in the plant who are directly engaged in production. The employer has the right to hire and dismiss based on the needs of the work. Therefore, when the employer does not intend to continue hiring after the contract expires, they should not force the employer to continue to sign an employment contract, or demand that the employer make arrangements that are not needed for production due to living difficulties. Because the task of the factory is to engage in production, if the employer is forced to build unnecessary projects or arrange for personnel that are not needed for production, it will inevitably affect the factory's production and operation; and this kind of employment that is not needed for production will inevitably cause employers to be concerned about hiring workers in general; even when production is needed, they will be unwilling to fully hire workers, thus affecting the employment opportunities of unemployed workers in general, causing disadvantages to both labor and management, and not conforming to the government's policy of developing production, prospering the economy, and benefiting both labor and management.

Third, the workers' employment problem after dismissal should be solved by the local trade union within the possible scope.

　　津劳动局仲裁永利劳资争议
  　依法解除双方雇佣关系
    【新华社天津三日电】天津市塘沽私营永利化学公司碱厂临时建筑工人，在劳资双方所订口头契约快要满期时，坚持要求改为长工或继续雇用，而与资方发生争议，经市劳动局依法仲裁，决定仍按契约规定办理。
    泥瓦工侯树璋、郭云霄、郑立文等八十三人，在去年四月，为永利碱厂雇用，修建该厂宿舍，后因战争关系，工程无法继续，由资方于去年十二月七日提前发放半月工资解雇。塘沽解放后，劳方要求复工，经塘大区工会办事处、永利临时职工代表会、劳方代表与资方代表，于二月二十六日协议，订立口头契约，言明仍由资方雇用，但最多雇用两期，每期为三个月，契约期限为自三月一日起至八月底止。但至五月下旬，该厂临时建筑工人复要求资方改为长工，或于原契约期满后继续订立雇用契约，而资方则认为契约期满后即需解雇，因此发生争议。
    争议发生后，塘大区工会即向该建筑工人们进行解释，说明工会自然愿意帮助大家就业，而且在这件事发生前，已经帮助了临时工中的技术工人和普通工人八十一人与资方交涉改为长工；但是泥瓦工是建筑工人，和其他临时工不同，而且有过六个月为期的口头契约，如果不履行契约，强要资方继续雇用，则可能引起资本家的顾虑，今后不敢雇用工人，因而影响大家就业的机会，对于发展生产也属不利。关于解雇后的生活问题，工会也说明将尽力帮助解决，计划设法向该厂长工募集基金设立劳动合作社，替他们谋包工工作。与此同时，市劳动局亦曾再三向劳方进行说服工作。塘大军管分会主任周克刚，曾于上月十九日召集泥瓦工开会，对大家害怕失业的顾虑表示同情，但劝告大家要听工会的话，组织劳动合作社，解决失业问题。但若干工人因在侯、郭、郑等个别偏激分子煽动胁迫下，坚持上述不合理要求，争议陷于僵局。
    八月二十一日，资方代表与劳方代表遂向天津市人民政府劳动局申请仲裁。当由市府劳动局组织仲裁委员会，并以该局副局长林超任主任，进行仲裁。该委员会于听取劳资双方分述事实经过并由双方进行辩驳后，当场宣布仲裁意见：根据“劳资两利、发展生产”的政策，劳资双方既然订有协议，则在契约期满时，资方可因工作上需要与否，自由雇用或解雇。因此，批准资方之申请，于民国三十八年八月三十一日起，双方解除雇佣关系，不附带任何条件。仲裁委员会除宣布在三日内将仲裁书分送劳资双方以外，并说明劳资双方于接到仲裁书后，任何一方如有不同意时，须于五日内向人民法院起诉，请求判决，否则仲裁决定即具有法律效力；同时声明在契约未满前，资方不得随便解雇或降低工人待遇；劳方也不得发生怠工或破坏生产等情事。
    又：在此以前，该永利碱厂除泥瓦工以外的临时工因永利碱厂资方对于长工、短工、临时工的划分存在着许多不合理现象，如在全厂二百四五十个临时工中有许多长期受雇，工作也和长工相同，而工资则仅约及长工的五分之一，且无福利待遇，因此曾要求改为长工和调整待遇。经天津市总工会慎重考虑，认为工人要求合理，当积极予以支持，经与资方取得协议，将抗战前在厂任长工的工人和临时工中的技术工、普通工担任长期固定工作者等共八十一人改任为长工，其余一百六十九名临时工的工资也得到了适当的调整。劳资双方并于八月五日签订了集体合同，争议乃告圆满解决。
    劳动局仲裁书
    【新华社天津三日电】天津市人民政府劳动局仲裁永利公司碱厂劳资争议的仲裁书于八月二十八日送达劳资双方，仲裁书全文如下：
    申诉人永利化学公司碱厂资方代表
    职别：副厂长，姓名：钟子璜，住所：塘沽永利碱厂职员宿舍
    被申诉人永利化学公司碱厂临时建筑工工人代表
    职别：工人，姓名：侯树璋，住所：塘沽永利碱厂工人宿舍
    永利化学公司碱厂资方与临时建筑工关于劳动契约争议，经本局仲裁委员会传讯双方后，兹仲裁如左：
    一、仲裁主文
    侯树璋、郭云霄、郑立文等八十三名，系永利化学公司碱厂之临时建筑工人（泥瓦工）。解放后，劳方要求复工，经劳资双方协议，订立两期共六个月之口头契约。契约期满资方根据生产需要，提出解约。经调查确实，仲裁委员会根据契约期满劳资任何一方不愿继续时，不得强制雇佣或受雇之原则，批准资方申请：依约于民国三十八年八月三十一日起，双方解除雇佣关系，不附带任何条件。
    二、事实及理由
    第一、侯树璋、郭云霄、郑立文等八十三名临时建筑工，据资方申诉，于民国三十七年十二月七日，因战争原因提前发放半月工资已予解雇。塘大解放后，劳方要求复工，经塘大区工会办事处永利临时职工代表会，劳方代表与资方代表于三月二十六日协议订立临时性之口头契约，言明每期三个月共计两期，自三月一日起至同年八月止，该项口头契约有协议纪录可凭，在此期间双方在事实上均已履行，因此不能认为该项契约无效。
    第二、劳方为建筑工人（泥瓦工），属土木临时工性质，与该厂直接从事生产之工人有别，资方因工作上之需要与否，有雇用与解雇之权，故于契约期满资方不拟继续雇用时，不应强迫资方继续订立雇佣契约，或以生活困难要求资方作生产上不需要之安插。因工厂之任务是从事生产，若强迫资方兴建不必要之工程或安插生产上不需要之人员，势必影响工厂之生产及营业；并且此种生产不需要之雇用，势将普遍引起资方对雇用工人之顾虑；即使在生产需要时也将不愿充分雇用工人，因而影响一般失业工人的就业的机会，使劳资两方均蒙不利，与政府发展生产繁荣经济劳资两利之政策不相符合。
    第三、解雇后工人就业问题，应请由该处工会在可能范围给予解决。
