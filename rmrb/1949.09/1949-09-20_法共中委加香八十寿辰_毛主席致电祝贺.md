[Broadcast by Xinhua Radio Station, Beiping] Beiping, 19th: Chairman Mao of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party sent a telegram on the 15th to congratulate Comrade Marcel Cachin (formerly translated as Caishan), member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party and editor-in-chief of L'Humanité, on his 80th birthday. The telegram reads as follows:

Dear Comrade Marcel Cachin and dear comrades of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party: Our Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party warmly celebrates Comrade Cachin's 80th birthday.

Comrade Cachin is a living symbol of the French revolutionary workers' movement and the French people's patriotic and democratic movement since the end of the 19th century. Comrade Cachin's loyalty to proletarian internationalism, his loyalty to the friendship between the French and Soviet peoples, and his warm sympathy for the liberation movements of the Chinese people and other oppressed nations are not only the pride of the French working class but also the common pride of the international working class.

Wishing Comrade Cachin good health! Sending fraternal greetings to Comrade Cachin and the Central Committee of the French Communist Party headed by Comrade Thorez.

　　　　　　　　　　Chairman Mao Zedong of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party
