Labor Hero Liu Yuhou
One of the Introductions to Representatives of the People's Political Consultative Conference
　　Comrade Liu Yuhou is from Haojiaqiao Village, Shatanping District, Suide County. His family was very poor when he was young. He started learning to cultivate the land at the age of twelve. At the age of fifteen, he often followed his father, getting up before dawn to carry dry grass from Yanchi, which was twenty miles away from home. After eating breakfast, he would go to the city to sell the grass. After several years of this, he finally paid off the debt of more than 130 strings that his father had incurred from arranging his stepmother and selling New Year's goods. From the age of sixteen, he rented land from landlords to cultivate, did odd jobs for people in the winter, and whenever he had time, he would pick up coal in the coal kiln, transport grain, and chop firewood.
　　In 1938, Liu Yuhou joined the Communist Party. In the spring of 1940, when the new government of Suide County was established, he was elected as the village head with the support of the masses. He was so excited that he told everyone he met, "Now we can finally look forward to the arrival of the Eighth Route Army." In the village, he took the lead in urging everyone to hand over grain, organized the militia, led the masses in their struggle against the landlords, and completed every task assigned to him by the masses.
　　Liu Yuhou not only worked hard but also cared about the lives of poor farmers. For example, in 1943, when Hao Yuxiu in the village had festering sores on his legs and could not go to the fields, he was the first to donate four liters of wheat to help him, and under his influence, everyone donated more than two dou of grain. During the spring plowing season, when Ma Shuangquan's land could not be plowed in time, he voluntarily lent his ox to him and urged him to work hard. With his active help and urging, Ma Shuangquan greatly improved his enthusiasm for production.
　　In 1943, Liu Yuhou was awarded the title of labor model by the Suide Prefectural Committee. He not only resolutely supported the Party's call, actively engaged in production himself, but also cared for, helped, and promoted everyone's active production, making Haojiaqiao a model village famous throughout the border region.
　　In the spring of 1943, Liu Yuhou launched a production competition challenge to the entire Suide sub-district, which sparked a production competition movement throughout the sub-district.
　　At that time, the people of Haojiaqiao were still skeptical about mutual aid production. Liu Yuhou first formed a mutual aid team with his two younger brothers, cousin, and brother-in-law. Under the influence of their achievements, the whole village universally organized themselves.
　　Due to Liu Yuhou's consistent hard work in production, by 1943, his family's life had greatly improved, and they had become a prosperous family with enough to eat, wear, and use.
　　The new society makes people happy, enterprising, and creative. Anyone who is determined to work and lead everyone to work can live a good life and gain the support of the masses. Liu Yuhou is such a typical example. His participation as a farmer representative in the People's Political Consultative Conference today is precisely the result of his hard work under the leadership of the Communist Party!

　　劳动英雄刘玉厚
  　人民政协代表介绍之一
    刘玉厚同志是绥德县沙滩坪区一乡郝家桥村人，少时家境非常贫困。他在十二岁就开始学耕地。十五岁，他即常随父亲，在天未明时便起身到距家二十里的砚池＠背干草，回家吃过早饭，再去城里把草卖掉。这样几年，他才把父亲为办继母及贩年货赔了本的一百三十多串债务还清。十六岁起，他就租地主的地种，冬天给人家打短工，一有空便去炭窑拾炭，贩运粮食，砍柴烧。
    一九三八年刘玉厚加入了共产党。一九四○年春绥德县新政权成立时，他就在群众的拥护下被选为村主任。他兴奋得逢人便说：“现在可盼到八路军来了。”在村中，他带头推动大家交粮，组织自卫队，领导群众与地主进行斗争，完成了群众给他的每一个任务。
    刘玉厚不仅工作努力，同时很关心穷苦农民的生活。譬如在一九四三年时，村里郝玉秀的腿疮溃烂了，不能下地，他就首先捐出四升麦子救济他，大家在他的影响下共捐了二斗多粮食。春耕时，马双泉的地耕不及了，他就把自己的耕牛义务借给他使用，并督促他好好劳动。在他的积极帮助和督促下，马双泉便大大提高了生产情绪。
    一九四三年刘玉厚被绥德地委奖励为劳动模范。他不仅坚决地拥护党的号召，自己积极生产，而且更关心帮助与推动大家积极生产，使郝家桥成为全边区闻名的模范村。
    在一九四三年春天，刘玉厚曾向绥德全分区提出比赛生产的挑战，使全分区到处展开了生产竞赛的运动。
    当时，郝家桥的人们还对变工生产抱着怀疑态度，刘玉厚首先就和他的两个弟弟、堂弟、妹夫组成了一个变工队。在他们获得成绩的影响下，全村也普遍地都跟着组织起来了。
    由于刘玉厚一贯努力生产，到一九四三年时，他的家庭生活便大大改善，而成为有吃、有穿、有用的富裕人家了。
    新社会使人快乐，有进取心，有创造性。任何人只要他决心劳动，并带领大家劳动，便可以过好日子，便可以得到群众的拥护。刘玉厚便是这样一个典型的范例。他今天成为参加人民政协的农民代表，正是他在共产党领导下努力劳动的成果！
