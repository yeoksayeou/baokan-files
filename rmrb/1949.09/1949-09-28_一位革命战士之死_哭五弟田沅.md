The Death of a Revolutionary Soldier
　　Crying for My Fifth Brother, Tian Yuan
　　Tian Han

　　When I pick up my pen to write about my fifth brother, Tian Yuan, he has already been resting peacefully in the Wujia Kiln Cemetery in Bali Tai, Tianjin, for almost half a month. I am so afraid to touch this sorrow.

　　My fifth brother came to Yan'an from Shanghai via Wuhan in 1938. Before that, he had been imprisoned for as long as a year because of his participation in the anti-imperialist work in Shanghai, and also because he was implicated by me. He was only released before the War of Resistance. In prison, he was even subjected to electric shocks, which damaged his body by the Kuomintang reactionaries.

　　He joined the Party in the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University in Wayaobao. Because he had been to Japan, he received training in the enemy training class in Yan'an at the end of 1939. In January 1940, he was transferred to the Enemy Work Department of the Political Department of the Jin-southeast Field Army. In May, he was transferred to the Enemy Work Section of the Shandong Guerrilla Column. He endured hardships in the difficult environment behind enemy lines. In June 1942, the Shandong Column was abolished and the Shandong Military Region was established. He worked in the Enemy Work Department of the Political Department of the Military Region, participating in the enemy and puppet research group of the Research Office of the Branch Bureau. In 1944, he served as the chief of the Enemy Work Section of the Political Department of the Lunan Military Region until the end of the war against the Japanese寇. Later, the Enemy Work Section was renamed the Liaison Section, and he continued to serve as the chief. In November 1947, he was transferred to the Second Military Subdistrict.

　　In February and March 1948, he requested to go south. He was once transferred to the Huaye随军 school. Before the Huaihai Campaign, he was assigned to the front line as a camp instructor in the Eighth Column. At that time, he was already ill. A sarcoma suddenly grew on his left jaw. He didn't pay much attention to it at first and continued to work despite his illness. It was not until our army annihilated the Huang Botao Corps in Nianzhuang and pursued the enemy to Suxian that he could no longer support himself. He then requested a recuperation and left the army.

　　He was sent to the Field Hygiene Department, and from there, he was sent to the First Hygiene Department of the First Military Subdistrict of the Central Plains Military Region for surgery. The result was not good. After living there for more than two months, he was transferred to the Kaifeng International Peace Hospital. He stayed there for a month, but surgery and electrotherapy were ineffective. He was transferred to Beiping and admitted to Peking Union Medical College Hospital and Peking University Hospital. Because the disease was already deep, both hospitals refused him. He lived in the Military Commission Guest House and there was nothing he could do but wait for death. He was in extreme pain. He wanted to risk returning to his hometown to see his mother, so he also returned his military horse. Since the communication soldier was also sick and unable to take care of him, he was sent to the Army Hospital by the guest house. Dr. Zhang there gave him a lot of comfort and kind treatment, and he gradually felt hopeful for recovery. When I returned from Europe, I saw him in the Army Hospital. I had a detailed discussion with Dr. Zhang, along with my brothers Hong Shen and Ding Zuan, and another Dr. Ji, at the hospital. Dr. Ji personally examined him and found out that the disease was malignant sarcoma of the tendons and bones, and there was no effective treatment method in the world. In the early stage, it could be removed by surgery, but now it has been delayed for too long and the bacteria have been transferred with the blood. It was hopeless. Dr. Zhang's comfort was just the kind lie of the doctors.

　　Because we had been separated for eleven years and had not exchanged letters, I had repeatedly asked friends in the Liberated Areas for information, but to no avail. My mother only thought that he had already sacrificed in the arduous battle. Now that the brothers can reunite, it should be so joyful. Unexpectedly, the situation is so unexpected, how can I not try to find a glimmer of hope for him from despair? I reported his situation to Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Zhou. Their kind concern showed a high degree of class love, which our brothers should be grateful for and never forget! Vice Chairman Zhou replied in a letter:

　　"After receiving your letter, I immediately forwarded it to Vice Minister Fu Lianzhang of the Health Department of the Military Commission, and told him to invite President Zhou Zhaozhao to visit Comrade Tian Yuan for consultation. Comrade Fu told me by telephone that Comrade Tian Yuan's illness was not a boil but a malignant tumor. I told him that no matter what, he should be sent to Peking University Affiliated Hospital immediately to try X-rays, and at the same time notify you to go together. The Health Department of the Military Commission should be fully responsible for all treatment and care. This disease has become difficult to treat. Revolutionary brothers have struggled for ten years, and your sadness is naturally expected. I hope you will inquire in various ways to see if there are other ways to think about it. If you have any gains, please tell me immediately, so as to make the best effort."

　　Because of the Vice Chairman's order, my fifth brother was transferred from the Army Hospital to the Peking University Hospital, which he had been refused before. Here he received nearly a month of X-ray treatment. It was also here that I had some conversations with him, and I roughly understood what he had been through in the past eleven years. He said with emotion: "If I hadn't come to the Liberated Area, I don't know what kind of person I would have become. I have really been reborn now. There are a few things I can tell you to comfort you. First, I have gone through strict rectification. I don't know how many nights I couldn't sleep during the rectification process. Now my ideological direction is finally accurate. I won't make any big mistakes. Second, I have never been stingy in economic matters, although I have handled a lot of money. Third, I can't say that I haven't made mistakes in the issue of men and women before, but in the past eleven years since I came to the Liberated Area, I have never been close to a woman." Regarding the latter, I knew he had some pain in Shanghai, but he was forty-five years old and had never been married, and of course had no children. As his eldest brother, I was even more saddened. I asked him why he didn't get married. After a long period of class education and sharing weal and woe with the brothers in the company, he had other ideas. He said: "During the revolutionary war, the majority of soldiers and officers cannot get married, and those who have wives at home cannot reunite with them. What does this count for me?" Also, when he was staying in the Army Hospital, I saw that there were many flies and mosquitoes in the ward, and I wanted to hang a mosquito net for him. He pointed to the patients in the same room and said: "They don't have any, I don't want to stand out." People say that he has a strong sense of Party spirit. I think it can also be seen from these places.

　　I knew he had no hope of recovery, so I gave him an exquisite handbook and asked him to write down the things of the past ten years while he was lying ill. At first, he didn't write because he was very optimistic and felt that he would always have a chance to write later. Later, he wanted to write but didn't have the strength to write. He talked about the gains and losses of our family several times. I said, let's not talk about the past. He believed that "it is also wrong not to ask about the past. We should review it carefully in the future." He criticized me for being too emotional, and both others and myself would suffer a lot of losses. At that time, I went to see him almost every day. He said: "You must be very busy. This will delay work. If I wasn't sick, I would be very busy too." There were a few days when I was really busy and didn't go. He asked the nurse to call me. When I went, he said quite sadly: "I miss you a little bit when you don't come for a few days." He had been fighting hard behind enemy lines for ten years and hadn't seen his relatives. How could he not want to see me a few more times? I felt infinitely sad in my heart.

　　His last criticism of me was in the Tianjin Central Hospital. Also because of the introduction of Dr. Hu from Peking University Hospital, saying that Dr. Jin Xianzai of Tianjin Enguang Hospital was a sarcoma expert and had radium treatment equipment, they advocated giving it a try. With the approval of the Vice Chairman, he was sent to Tianjin again, staying in the Central Hospital. More than ten days later, my fifth brother wrote a letter, saying that the skin that had been removed from his face had all grown back, and the doctor was ready to perform the operation, asking me to go to Tianjin immediately. When I went to Tianjin to see him, he was indeed in much better spirits, and the tumor on his face also seemed to have disappeared a lot. When I asked Dr. Jin, I learned that the situation was completely the opposite. The tumor had metastasized to the inside. It was said that X-rays and blood tests showed that there were also tumors in the lungs, and the ribs had softened. Facial surgery was no longer necessary. Therefore, I saw him the next day and, on the recommendation of Ms. Yu Shan, wanted to find an old Chinese medicine doctor, Xiao, and returned to Beiping. A few days later, I received his letter, blaming me for not paying attention to the main task. He said that the main purpose of my trip to Tianjin should be for his illness. I shouldn't have returned to Beiping without giving the doctor any explanation. He also said: "Let me die, I don't want to eat a grinder meal here, wasting the people's money." He said the same in a letter to Vice Minister Fu. Vice Minister Fu replied to comfort him, asking him to rest assured and not to worry about the cost. He didn't send any more letters from then on. Unfortunately, I myself caught a cold those days. Old Mr. Xiao was found, and I was negotiating to bring him back to Beiping when I received the notice that he was critically ill.

　　I arrived in Tianjin at 10 pm on August 29th, and at 8:30 am the next morning, I arrived at the hospital. He was already skin and bones, maintaining difficult and heavy breathing. Because the tumor poison had entered the back of his head, he was not very conscious. Dr. Han held him up and said: "Comrade Tian, ​​see who's here?" I also called "Fifth Brother" repeatedly, but he couldn't open his eyes, only his mouth moved slightly. I hurriedly returned to the guest house to make various preparations. The hospital called and reported that Yuan Di had passed away. The time was 9 am on the 30th. With his last strength, he finally managed to wait until I came to see him.

　　According to Ms. Yu Shan, she went to the hospital to see him when she returned to Tianjin from Ping. He was still very clear. He just wanted to go south to work after he recovered and visit his mother by the way. He also said, "After the operation, I can go south in two months at most. My body is broken, and I can't do the army's work anymore. I just want to do municipal work." He thought he could work for at least twenty years. He really didn't want to die easily and was willing to do his last bit of effort for the people. The hospital did not give me his belongings. I don't know if he left any words on his notebook. I still have his letter to his mother here. I am not prepared to forward this letter to her:

　　"Mother:
　　My brother said that your health is very good. I wish you good fortune, health, and no disasters from afar. It has been more than ten years since I saw your kind face and did not communicate. How can you not think that my life or death is unknown? Since I left your lap, I first went to northern Shaanxi. I stayed in Yan'an for about two years and then went to Shandong behind enemy lines. I fought with the enemy for eight years in Shandong and with the Kuomintang for two years. I have been doing well in these ten years. I have not been killed by the enemy, nor have I been injured. But I have suffered a lot. Suffering is necessary. Mom, I am a reborn person now. Unfortunately, mother and son cannot meet immediately.
　　Mom, I am telling you something now. Don't be sad. I am now sick and being treated in the north. I can only go home when I get better that day. Mom, take care of your health.
　　In addition, please say hello to Uncle Man and Uncle Jiang on my behalf. I respectfully wish you peace and good health.

　　Your son, Shoulin"

　　His superiors in the field army also understood him very well. General Chen Yi said: "I have seen him in the military headquarters. He is a very honest and hardworking comrade." Yesterday, General Chen wrote a tombstone for Yuan Di and attached such a letter. I think this is enough to comfort my fifth brother in the ground and enough to encourage the vast number of comrades who honestly and sincerely serve the people's revolution:

　　"Comrade Tian Yuan, your younger brother, has exhausted his efforts for the people's cause due to accumulated labor in battle. His peers are all saddened by the news. To serve the people without any price and without any conditions, to shed the last drop of blood and exhale the last breath is the highest quality of a revolutionary. Comrade Tian Yuan is one of them. The people will always commemorate such people. The task of those of us who die later is to continue to complete the unfinished business of the martyrs. I am writing this letter to express my condolences to Comrade Tian Yuan. I hope you will allow it to be our common oath to jointly complete the new revolutionary combat tasks. With revolutionary salute

　　Chen Yi sincerely
　　September 17th"

　　一位革命战士之死
  　哭五弟田沅
    田汉
    当我提起笔想写一写五弟田沅的时候，他已经安眠在天津八里台乌家窑墓地快半个月了。我是这样不敢触起这悲哀。
    五弟是一九三八年由上海经武汉到延安的。那以前，他因参加上海反帝工作，又因受我牵累曾被捕入狱达一年之久，直到抗战前才放出来，在狱中他甚至受过电刑，把身体给国民党反动派磨折坏了。
    他是在瓦窑堡抗大加入党的。因他到过日本，一九三九年底在延安敌训班受训。一九四○年一月调晋东南野战政治部敌工部工作。五月间又调到山东游击纵队敌工料。在敌后困难环境中备尝辛苦。一九四二年六月间山东纵队取消，成立山东军区，他在军区政治部敌工部工作，参加分局调查研究室敌伪研究股。一九四四年任鲁南军区政治部敌工科科长，直到打完日寇为止。其后敌工科改联络科，他仍任科长。一九四七年十一月调到第二军分区。
    一九四八年二三月他要求南下。一度调华野随军学校。淮海战役前分派到前方，任第八纵队营教导员。那时他已经有病了，左颚上忽长一肉瘤，他起先不甚在意，仍带病工作。直到我军在碾庄消灭了黄伯韬兵团，又追敌到宿县，他实在不能支持了，才请求休养，离开了部队。
    他被送到野战卫生部，由那里，又送到中原军区第一军分区第一卫生处开刀。结果不好。住了两个多月转到开封国际和平医院，住了一月，开刀电疗皆无大效，又转到北平，入协和和北大医院，因病已深，都被拒绝了。住在军委会招待所，无计可施只有待毙。他痛苦不堪。想冒险回到家乡看看母亲，因此把军马也缴还了。适通讯员亦病，不能照顾他，便由招待所送到陆军医院。那里的张大夫给了他许多安慰，和亲切治疗，他又渐觉有回春之望。我从欧洲回便是在陆军医院见到他的。曾和洪深、丁瓒两兄及另一吉大夫到医院找张大夫仔细谈过，吉大夫又亲为检查，才知此病是恶性筋骨瘤，全世界尚无特效治疗法。初起时可开刀拿掉，到现在耽误过久病菌已随血液转移，竟是绝望，张大夫的安慰不过医生们善良的谎言罢了。
    因为和他隔别了十一年信也不曾通过。多次托到解放区的朋友打听也不得结果，我母亲是只当他在艰苦战斗中早已牺牲了的。于今兄弟又得重逢，应该是多么欢喜。万不料情形竟如此意外，如何不想从绝望中替他找一线生机呢？我曾把他的情形报告给毛主席周副主席。他们的亲切关怀表现了高度的阶级友爱，值得我们兄弟感谢不忘！副主席回信说：
    “手书到后即转军委会卫生部傅连璋副部长，并告其邀同周泽昭院长去往诊视田沅同志。傅同志曾以电话告我，田沅同志所患非疔毒而为恶性瘤。我当告以不管如何应立即送往北大附属医院，用Ｘ光试看，并同时通知你一道前往。一切治疗料理要军委会卫生部负其全责。此病已成难治之症，革命兄弟十年奋斗，你之难过自在意料之中，惟望你多方探询，看有无其他办法可想。如有所得望即告我，以尽最善努力。”
    因为副主席的命令，五弟由陆军医院移到一度被拒绝过的北大医院。在这里受了将近一月的Ｘ光治疗。也是在这里我曾和他谈过一些话，大体了解了他这十一年间的经过。他曾慨然地说：“我若不到解放区来，不知会成一个什么样子的人。我现在真是脱胎换骨了。有几桩事可以告慰你们。第一，我经过严格的整风。在整风的过程中我不知有多少晚不能成眠。现在我的思想方向总算搞准了。不会犯什么大错误。第二，我在经济上从来丝毫不苟，虽则我手里也经过很多的钱。第三，我以前在男女问题上不能说没有犯过错误，但自到解放区这十一年我从不曾接近过女人。”关于后者在上海时我知道他曾有过一些痛苦，但他四十五岁了，不曾结过婚，当然没有留下儿女，作为他的长兄我是倍加难过的。我曾问他为什么不结婚。经过长期的阶级教育和与连队弟兄同甘苦的他又另有其想法。他说：“革命战争进行期中广大员兵不能结婚，家里有老婆的也不能回去重聚，我这算得了什么。”又他住陆军医院时我见病房里苍蝇蚊子甚多，要给他挂一床蚊帐。他指同房病友们说：“他们都没有，我不要突出。”人家说他党性很强，我想从这些地方也可看出的。
    我明知他回春无望，曾给过他精致的手册，要他趁卧病中把这十几年的事写下来。起先他没有写因为他很乐观，觉得以后总有机会写，后来是想写而没有气力写了。他几次谈到我们一家人的得失，我说过去了的事别谈了吧。他认为“不问过去也是不对的。将来有机会应该好好地检讨一下。”他批评我过于重感情，于人于己都不知吃多少亏。那时候我几乎每天都去看他，他说：“你一定很忙，这样要耽误工作的。我若不病，我也很忙。”有几天我真因事忙没有去。他又托看护打电话找我。去时他颇为哀切地说：“你几天不来我又有点想你。”在敌后苦斗十年不见亲人，他如何不想多见我几次。我听了心里无限惨然。
    他最后批评我是在天津中央医院。也是因北大医院的胡大夫们的介绍，说天津恩光医院的金显斋大夫是瘤科专家，又有镭锭治疗设备，主张一试。得副主席批准，他又被送到天津，寄居中央医院。隔了十余日五弟来信，说脸上脱去的皮已都长好，医生做好开刀准备，要我即日赴津。我到天津看他果然精神好得多了，脸上瘤子也似乎消了许多。及问金大夫才知情形完全相反。瘤子已转移到内部，据云经Ｘ光照视及抽血检查知肺部亦有瘤，肋骨且已软化。面部开刀已无必要。因此我第二天看了他一下，依俞珊女士的推荐又想找一位中医萧老先生，就回北平来了。隔几日接了他的信，责备我不重视主要任务。说我赴津的主要目的应该是为他的病。不应该对医生全无交代便回北平。他又说：“死就死吧，我不愿在这里吃磨床饭，虚费人民的钱。”他一封致傅副部长的信也如此说。傅副部长回信安慰他，要他安心静养，不要以费用为念。从此他没有信来了。碰得不巧，那些日子我自己也染了寒疾，萧老先生找到了，正交涉把他接回北平，便接得他危笃的通知。
    八月二十九日晚十时到津，翌晨八时半到医院，他已是瘦骨一把，维持着困难的粗大的呼吸。因瘤毒转入后脑，神智也不大清了。韩大夫扶着他说：“田同志，你看谁来了？”我也连叫“老五”，他已不能睁眼只嘴略动而已。急回招待所做各种准备，医院的电话来了，报告沅弟辞世。时为三十日上午九时。他以其最后的毅力总算支持到我来见了他一面。
    据俞珊女士说她由平回津曾去医院看他，人还很清楚，他只想病好后南下工作顺便看看母亲，又说“开刀后至多养两个月便可南下，身体坏了，部队的事是不能搞了，只想做做市政工作。”他想他至少还可以工作二十年。他是真不愿轻易死去而愿为人民尽最后一点气力的。他的遗物病院没有交给我，不知他的本子上留什么话没有。我这里还留有他给母亲的信，这信我是不预备转给她老人家的：
    “母亲：
    哥哥说您的身体很康健，儿现遥祝您福寿康宁，永无灾难。十余年不见慈颜，又不通音信，怎不叫您胡想我生死不明呢？儿自离开膝下，先到陕北，在延安约二年即到敌人后方山东，在山东和敌人斗了八年，和国民党斗了两年。在这十年中算是不错，没有给敌人打死，也未负过伤。但吃的苦头不少。吃苦是应该的。妈，儿现在是脱胎换骨的人了。可惜母子不能马上见面。
    妈，现告您一事。您不要难过，儿现在害了病在北方治疗，只有等到那天好，那天才能回家。妈，好好保重身体。
    此外满舅蒋二舅请代儿问好，专此敬祝福安　　　　　　　　　　
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　儿寿麟”
    他所属的野战军的上级也很了解他。陈毅将军说：“我在军部见过他，他是一位很老实工作的同志。”昨天又承陈将军给沅弟写了墓碑，还附了这样的信，我想这是足安慰五弟于地下，也足以鼓励广大老老实实为人民革命服务的同志们的：
    “令弟田沅同志因战斗积劳尽瘁人民事业，同辈闻之莫不伤痛。不要任何代价，不附带任何条件，为人民服务，流最后一滴血，吐最后一口气，这是革命家的最高品质，田沅同志是其中的一个。这样的人，人民将永远纪念他们。我们后死者的任务便是继续完成先烈的未竟事业。我写这封信来表示对田沅同志的哀悼，你谅能准许作为我们共同的誓言，去共同完成新的革命战斗任务。致革命的敬礼
    陈毅谨启
