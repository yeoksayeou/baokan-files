　　Hua Xing Factory Discovers Bad Element:
　  Bi Qingjiang Repents After Being Criticized by All Workers for Oppressing Workers and Sowing Discord

　　[From Our Newspaper] The workers of the private Hua Xing Weaving, Dyeing, and Printing Factory in the Eleventh District, through education and struggle, have made Bi Qingjiang, a bad element who oppressed the masses, lower his head. The factory's production and various tasks have been fully mobilized. The workers happily said: "With the bad root pulled out, unity can be achieved." "The Communist Party's methods are good; they can transform a person without beating or scolding." Now, the workers are actively and enthusiastically preparing to establish a formal trade union, intensifying their studies, and improving the quality of their products.

　　Bi Qingjiang, a worker in the dyeing factory, was formerly a landlord. During the Japanese invasion, he served as a "Jia" head and clerk for the enemy. During the land reform, he fled to Beiping and joined the Hua Xing Factory as a worker. After arriving at the factory, he won over four backward workers, calling them brothers and forming a small clique. After liberation, he fabricated rumors and slandered the People's Liberation Army, deceiving the workers. In front of the working comrades, he pretended to be active. When the factory was electing a preparatory committee, he relied on his old foreman status and the support of his small clique to squeeze into the preparatory committee. During this period, he appeared to be very active on the surface, but secretly used the wage issue to sow discord between the workers of the weaving and dyeing factories, saying: "The dyeing factory earns more money, while the weaving factory earns less. We dyeing factory workers have to support the weaving factory!" Some new workers in the dyeing factory had high skills and high wages, and he distorted the facts, saying: "Old workers have been here longer, but their wages are less than the new workers," attempting to create contradictions between the old and new workers. This did indeed affect the unity among the workers and the development of trade union work at that time. However, as the workers' awareness gradually increased and they discovered Bi Qingjiang's sabotage, they immediately removed him from his position on the preparatory committee.

　　After being removed from the preparatory committee, Bi Qingjiang still did not correct his erroneous behavior. He continued to use his old foreman's authority to interfere with technicians, direct workers, and hinder production. Workers could not be transferred without his consent, and workers could not take leave without telling him. Cloth that should have been washed eight times was only washed six times by him, causing some of the cloth to be dyed poorly, and increasing the amount of wasted work. At this time, the working cadres and the preparatory committee did not fully recognize the seriousness of the problem. Han Genlin, a member of the preparatory committee, only emphasized education and transformation, and mistakenly believed that the existence of disunity in the factory was not honorable for the preparatory committee, forming a principle-less concession. Due to the trade union's unprincipled concession to the bad element Bi Qingjiang, the dyeing factory workers felt disappointed in the trade union. This problem was not seriously addressed until Jiang Xiaolu's wastefulness led to Li Meirong criticizing him, and it was discovered that Jiang not only did not accept the criticism but, under the direction of Bi Qingjiang, arbitrarily beat someone. Only then did the trade union pay serious attention, and make a deep understanding of Bi Qingjiang, and timely correct the erroneous ideas of the working comrades and Han Genlin, and began to mobilize the workers to launch a struggle against the bad element. The workers' long-suppressed anger erupted, and they put forward more than twenty facts about Bi Qingjiang's rumors, sowing discord, sabotaging production, oppressing workers, and embezzling public and private funds, unanimously demanding the removal of the bad egg from the factory. Later, the trade union explained to the workers that as long as Bi Qingjiang was willing to admit his mistakes and genuinely correct them, they would still strive to transform him. Finally, under the leadership of the preparatory committee, activists from the entire factory discussed and held a meeting to allow Bi Qingjiang to publicly admit his mistakes.

　　On September 7th, the preparatory committee representatives convened a general meeting of all factory workers. At the meeting, Bi Qingjiang finally fully admitted his mistakes, bowed his head to the masses of workers in the entire factory, and expressed his willingness to change his old thinking and style, and to start a new life under everyone's supervision.

　　华兴厂发现坏分子
　  毕庆江欺压工人挑拨团结经全厂工人批评表示悔过
    【本报讯】十一区私营华兴织染印花工厂的工人们，经过教育斗争，使欺压群众的坏分子毕庆江低头了，全厂的生产与各项工作都已经完全动起来了。工人们高兴的说：“拔了坏根，团结就能搞好了。”“共产党办法就是好，不打不骂就能把一个人改造好。”现在工人们正在积极热烈的准备成立正式工会，加紧学习，提高产品的质量。
    染厂工人毕庆江从前是个地主，日寇侵略时当过敌人的甲长、文书，土改时逃来北平入华兴厂作工。到厂后拉拢了四个落后工人，称兄道弟，闹小集团。解放后又造谣诬蔑人民解放军，欺骗工人。在工作同志面前则假充积极，厂子里选筹委时，凭着旧杂工头的地位，和小集团的支撑，钻进了筹委会。这个时期，他表面上很积极，暗地却利用工资问题，挑拨织染两厂工人的感情，说什么：“染厂赚钱多，织厂赚钱少，我们染厂还得养活他们织厂哩！”染厂有些新工人技术高工资多，他歪曲事实说：“老工人年头长，工钱倒比新工人少”，企图造成新旧工人间的矛盾，这在当时也确实影响了工人之间的团结和工会工作的开展。但当工人觉悟逐渐提高，发觉了毕庆江的破坏行为之后，马上就罢免了他的筹委职务。
    毕庆江被罢免了筹委以后，仍不改正错误行为。又利用旧工头的威势干涉技师，指挥工人，妨碍生产，厂子里调动工人非经他同意不行，工人请假非和他讲不行。该洗八次的布，他只洗六次，因之使布染坏了一部分，废活加多。这时工作干部及筹委会对这个问题的严重性还认识不够，筹委韩根林只强调教育改造，并错误的认为工厂里有不团结现象对筹委是不光荣的，形成无原则的迁就。由于工会对坏分子毕庆江无原则迁就，染厂工人对工会感到失望。这个问题直到工人姜晓禄因浪费而引起李梅荣给他提出了批评意见，姜不但不接受反而受毕庆江的指使随意打人的事情被发现后，工会才认真注意起来，于是工会对毕庆江作了深刻的了解，及时纠正了工作同志和韩根林的错误思想，开始发动工人对坏分子展开斗争。工人们压抑已久的愤怒爆发出来，提出了二十多条关于毕庆江造谣生事，破坏团结，妨碍生产，欺压工人，贪污公私款项的事实，一致要求清除坏蛋出厂。后来工会对工人进行解释，只要毕庆江肯承认错误，并且真正改正，还是争取改造他。最后由筹委会领导全厂积极分子酝酿开会，让毕庆江公开承认错误。
    九月七号，筹委代表召开了全厂工人大会，会上毕庆江终于全部承认了自己的错误，向全厂工人群众低头，表示愿意改变旧的思想作风，在大家的监督下重新作人。
