Yangshijie Cotton Mill Director Xue
  Did Not Employ Private Individuals
  He Conducted a Review and Explanation of Zhang Yuqing's Opinions
To the Editor: After reading Mr. Zhang Yuqing's opinions on me in the "Voice of the Readers" column on page four of the People's Daily on August 22nd, I believe this kind of critical spirit is very good and worthy of our attention in future work, so as to avoid further misunderstandings.

    In our factory, there are more than 600 workers, and many workers often offer suggestions for improving our work, all of which I accept. Even so, I still have many shortcomings, especially this time with the temporary female workers who applied. Because I was busy with work, I was unable to patiently explain all the factory's conditions to them; my attitude was not amiable enough, and my speech was blunt. This is indeed something I should pay attention to improving in my style in the future. Now I will introduce the actual situation and the method of recruiting female workers to explain Mr. Zhang's misunderstanding of us.

    Since our factory accepted the winter clothing task assigned by the higher authorities, all the workers have been working with a spirit of assault to carry out this arduous task. Due to work needs, 400 female workers were recruited in early August, stipulating that applicants must have a letter of introduction from the district government or a certificate of military family status. However, workers in our factory who are responsible for introducing applicants do not need a letter of introduction to enter the factory for trial work. In order to complete the task assigned by the higher authorities on schedule, the factory plans that each worker must complete a set of quilted cotton clothes for soldiers in four hours per day. If they meet the conditions, regardless of whether they are family members of martyrs, soldiers, cadres, or ordinary citizens, they will be selected based on merit. However, after starting work, many newly recruited workers quit halfway due to reasons such as the distance being too far or the factory being filled with dust all day long and the air not suiting their bodies. Under the urgent rush to make winter clothes, whenever a worker quits, replacements must be recruited successively, and the conditions are still in accordance with the above standards. Mr. Zhang came on the 13th, and the situation was like this: the few female workers he referred to came on the 12th. Because there was no space at that time, we gave them a slip stamped with a seal, telling them to come to the factory early the next morning to take the test first. However, because Mr. Zhang's request was so eager at the time, we also allowed them to take the test together. While everyone was working, I went to get the slip given yesterday. At that time, Mr. Zhang saw this situation and, not understanding the actual situation above, mistakenly believed that we were arbitrarily employing private individuals. Furthermore, Mr. Zhang said that only I am responsible for our factory, which is not the case. We have eight members of the trade union committee and workers' representatives here, plus eleven of our administrative staff. I was assigned to Beijing after the liberation of Beiping, and I have only been working for more than three months. This place is thousands of miles away from my hometown, and I have no relatives here, so how can I talk about having private individuals? Standing on the position of revolutionary work, in order to do a good job of the entire task, I adhere to the principle of being fair to people and not to things. Although our factory stipulates that we start work at 6:30, the general workers' awareness has been raised, and their enthusiasm for work is very high. Almost every day, many people come to the factory to work at 5 o'clock. How could I get up at 7 o'clock? In the future, I hope that you will offer suggestions as much as possible under the principle of seeking truth from facts to help us improve our work. I will be very grateful!

### 羊市街棉厂薛厂长　并没有任用私人　他对张玉清的意见作了检讨解释

　　羊市街棉厂薛厂长
  　并没有任用私人
  　他对张玉清的意见作了检讨解释编辑同志：看到八月廿二日人民日报四版读者之声栏内刊载张玉清先生对我提的意见，我认为这种批评精神很好，值得我们今后在工作中注意，免得再生误会。
    在我们工厂，共有六百多位工友，经常有很多工友对我们提出改进工作的意见，我没有不接受的。虽然这样，我的缺点还很多，尤其是这次对投考的临时女工，因工作繁忙，没能很耐心的给她们解释厂内一切情况；态度不够和蔼，说话生硬，这的确是我今后在作风上应该注意改进的。现在我把实际情况及招募女工办法介绍一下，以解释张先生对我们的误会。
    本厂自接受了上级分配的冬装任务后，所有工友都以突击精神来执行这艰巨的任务。因为工作需要，于八月初招募女工四百名，规定投考者须有区政府之介绍信或军属之证明文件。但本厂工友负责介绍者不用介绍信即可入厂试工，为了如期完成上级分配的任务，厂内计划每工每日四小时须完成铺缝战士棉衣裤一套，倘符合条件，不分烈、军、干属及市民一律择优而用。但是开工后，新考取的工友，有因路途太远，或因厂内终日灰尘飞扬，空气不合乎自己身体等情，而致中途退厂者很多，在冬装任务紧急赶做之下，每遇退厂者即须陆续考补，其条件仍按上述标准。张先生是十三日来的，情形是这样：所指有几个女工是十二日来的，因当时没有地方，我们给开了一个条子，上面盖了戳子，教她们明天一早来厂先考，但因为张先生当时要求殷切，故亦予一并考试。大家正在作活之际，我去要昨天给的条子，当时张先生看见这种情形，不明以上的实际情况，因误认为我们是任意用私人。再者，张先生说我们厂只有我一人负责，并不是这样，我们这里工会委员及工人代表就有八人，连我们行政工作同志共十一人。我自北平解放后分派来平，工作仅三月余，此地与我家乡相隔千里，并无亲族，何谈私人之有，站在革命工作立场，为了整个任务之搞好，我是一本对事不对人的原则。我们工厂虽规定六时半上班，但一般工友觉悟之提高，工作热情很高，每天差不多五点钟就有很多到厂工作，我岂能七点才起。今后望在实事求是的原则下，尽量提意见，来帮助我们改进工作，是所至感！　　　　　　北平被服厂羊市街棉场
