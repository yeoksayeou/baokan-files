Worker Dong Ruicheng's Grievance Account
Wang Li

There is a worker in the Tangshan Machine Factory named Dong Ruicheng, nicknamed "Dong Datian" (Big Pockmarked Dong) because he has a face full of pockmarks. Now, whether it's the staff, workers, old, or young in the factory, they all call him "Datian." Everyone has forgotten Dong Ruicheng's name; the three characters "Dong Datian" have become popular. That day, at the general meeting of workers in the carriage frame shop, he said: "This anger has been憋 (bie) up for several years, and today, now that we are liberated, let’s talk about it. I can't speak well; I'll just say some local words. The back pay of thirty-five years and four months of basic salary wasn't issued, the goods and grains weren't given, and the workers didn't even get coal. They (referring to the factory under the Kuomintang) deposited the money in the bank, exchanging large bills for small bills, and they used it for eating, drinking, playing, and enjoying themselves, using our workers' blood and sweat! We didn't even dare to say anything; if we said anything, they would say we were 'reactionaries.' Who dared to speak up then? I, Dong Datian, am not a Communist, but for the sake of all of us workers wanting to live, on December 2nd, thirty-five years, we surrounded the building, and the workers shouted, 'Support Dong Datian! We want our benefits!' I said to everyone, 'Maintain order, stand your ground and support us!' I entered the factory director's office, but that old boy of a director wasn't there, I don’t know if he was hiding or scared away! The Section Chief of the Second Section was sitting in the room. I said to him, 'I'm here to speak on behalf of the workers. First, why isn't the back pay being given to us? Second, it's getting cold, and the workers' wives and children are freezing at home. You're holding back the coal, what's your intention? Third, our flour hasn't been given out. How come the eight *xi* (*xi* means section, referring to staff) have been given theirs?' He saw that I wasn't soft, so he said, 'It's all given to you, all given to you!' I said, 'If we don't come and ask for it, you won't give it; if we come and ask for it, you say you'll give it. Fine, as long as you give it!' Wang Zhenxiang was there at the time. I said, 'Wang Zhenxiang, you go and answer the workers.' That traitorous lackey didn't dare to come out. I also said, 'You, the 'union chairman,' don't handle this matter. What are you doing? I called you three times, and you didn't come. When you came, you didn't do anything!' That made him come out. As soon as we came out of the building, the workers shouted, 'Down with Wang Zhenxiang!' Some were cursing. Wang Zhenxiang saw that the situation wasn't good, so he slipped back inside.

Although the benefits were demanded and obtained, I knew I had caused trouble. After work, the workers came to my house to see me. I said to them, "Wang Zhenxiang and the others must be having a meeting. They will definitely call me in tomorrow. Don't worry, I won't implicate others. I'm doing this for everyone's benefit. But, if I die, my family is here, please take care of them. Don't just remember that I died; remember our reason for wanting benefits.”

The next morning, my daughter-in-law called me to wash my face. I said, "What's the use of washing my face? Find my *magua* (traditional Chinese jacket) and cotton trousers. I need to prepare myself. Maybe they'll shoot me today, or maybe they'll send me to military court." My whole family started crying. I said, "If I die, live your lives well in the future, and don't forget how I died. Don't remember me!" I also told my son to study hard. My wife wiped away her tears and said, "Can't we just not go today?" I said, "For everyone's benefit, I'm willing to die. Why wouldn't I go? Don't be afraid. No matter what happens today, I have to go!" At this point, Dong Datian's tears rolled down his cheeks. Some of the workers who were listening lowered their heads and wiped their tears with their hands, while others looked at Datian with tears in their eyes. He took a breath and continued: "Sure enough, when I got to the factory, the director sent the guard, that fellow surnamed Yin, to call me. As we walked, he said, 'Be careful!' Hey! That fellow, it's not like I'm going to be crushed by a belt, but he asks: 'Is business good lately?' I said, 'There's always business. Yin, don't mess with me. I'm more clearheaded in my sleep than you are!'"

As soon as I entered the director's office, two guards with guns were standing on either side, gesturing! Really something. I said to the guards, "Dong Datian has seen all kinds of guns, but I've never been shot. I wanted benefits; do you two get a share too?"

The director was pretending to be well-behaved! He put down the newspaper and said, "You're Dong Ruicheng?! You command thousands of people yourself; that's not simple. You're leading riots, being reactionary, and trying to sabotage the machines. You have bad intentions." When I heard that, I thought, "This is putting a hat on me, accusing me of crimes!" I said, "Stop talking! If you don't give us things and secretly sell the flour, it's right for us not to say anything?" He said, "Today, the military headquarters wants you. Our factory can't control it or protect you. We're sending you to the military headquarters. Commander Hou can handle it however he wants!" Later, they put on a show, having a staff member from the materials section act like a good guy, even saying, "Considering your age and seniority, I'll put in a good word for you to the higher-ups." As a result, they fired me. Wang Sheng and Song Xiu were also fired at the same time. We depend on working to eat. After being fired, we couldn't make ends meet. As a result, my wife attempted suicide twice. People eat three meals a day, but my children and wife eat two... Now, we're liberated, and the Communists have come! We workers are now the masters. We should talk about the oppression we suffered so that everyone knows what was good and what was bad. I understand that the Communist Party is the party of us workers. Everyone must study hard, pay attention to the activities of those bad elements, and work hard in production so that we workers can improve our lives. Do you all agree?" As he spoke, he smiled happily. Decades of oppression and suffering have been liberated today by the Communist Party.

　　工人董瑞成诉苦记
    王黎
    唐山机厂有位工人，叫董瑞成的，绰号叫“董大天”，因为他长着一脸麻子。现在厂里无论职员工友老年的，青年的，见了他都叫声“大天”，大家把董瑞成这个名字忘了，“董大天”三个字反到吃开了。那天在车架场全体工人大会上，他说：“这口气蹩了好几年，今天解放了咱们讲讲，咱可不会说话，尽说些土话。三十五年四个月的基本金追加没发，物品杂粮没给，煤也没咱工人的份儿，他们（指国民党时厂方）把钱存在银行里，大票子下小票子，他们拿来吃喝玩乐、享受，咱们工人的血汗，咱们还不敢啃声，一说他们就说是‘反动’，那儿还有人敢说话？我董大天不是共产党，可是为咱们工人们大家要活命，三十五年十二月二号那天咱们把大楼一围，工友们一喊：‘拥护董大天！我们要好处！’我向大家说：‘大家守秩序，站脚助威！’我进了厂长室，厂长那老小子不在，不知是藏啦，或是吓跑啦！屋里坐着的是二课长，我和他说：‘我是代表工人来说话的，第一、基本金追加，为什么不给我们？第二、天眼看就冷了，工友们老婆孩子在家里受冻，你们压着煤不发，你们存啥心意？第三、我们的面没给，八大系有发的是怎么回事？’（系即科指职员）他一看我不软，就说：‘都给你们，都给你们！’我说：‘我们不来要，你们就不给；来要，你们就说给。好，只要给就行！’王振祥那时在旁边，我说：‘王振祥你去回答工人吧。’那汉奸狗腿子不敢出来。我又说：“你‘工会主任’也不办这事，办什么，打电话叫你三遍，你不来，来了，不管事！”说的他只好出来。我们刚一出楼门，工人们就喊起来了：“打倒王振祥！”有的骂起来。王振祥一看这势架不好，就往回溜。
    虽然好处要求下来了，我知道我闯下了祸。下班后，工友们来我家看我，我对他们说：“王振祥他们一定有集会，明儿一定把我叫了去。放心，我不连带别人，咱是为大家的好处来着，可是，我要死了，我家眷在这儿，大家照看着点，别为我死了，老记念着。要记住，咱们要好处的意思。”
    第二天早晨，儿媳妇喊我洗脸，我说：“还洗啥脸，把我的马挂子，棉裤，找出来，我得预备一下，说不定今天他们就把我枪毙了，也许送军法处。”一家人掉起泪来，我说：“如果我死了，以后你们好好过日子，别忘了我是怎么死的，你们别记念我！”我又嘱咐儿子要学好，我女人擦着泪说：“咱今天不去就不行吗？”我说：“为了大家的好处，死了也甘愿，为啥不去？你们都不要怕，今天就是怎么样我也得去！”董大天说到这儿泪珠便滚滚的流下来，听的工人们也有的低下头用手擦泪，也有的眼里含着泪看着大天。他换了口气接着说：“进了厂果然厂长打发守卫姓尹的那小子来叫我，一边走着他说：‘小心点儿啊！’嘿！这小子，我又不是上皮带受绞去，他还问：‘这阵子买卖好么？’我说：‘那天都有买卖，姓尹的，你别和我闹这个，我睡着都比你明白！’”
    一进厂长室，两个守卫的拿着枪一边一个，比划着呢！真不简单。我和守卫的说：“董大天什么枪都看见过，就是没吃过枪子儿，我要好处，可有你们两人两份啊！”
    厂长看着报装孙子呢！他放下报说：“你就是董瑞成啊？！你自己支配几千人，可不简单，你领着捣乱、反动、想破坏机器，你是没安好心。”我一听坏啦，这是扣帽子，按罪名呢！我说：“别说了，你们不给东西，偷着卖面，我们不说，就对啦！？”他说：“今天军部要你，我们厂里也管不了，也护不了，把你送军部去，侯军长爱怎样处理，就怎样处理吧！”后来他们装神弄鬼，让现在材料科的一个职员去装好人，还说：“念起我年纪大，工龄老，给上边说好话，”结果把我开除了。同时开除的还有王生、宋秀。咱们就是凭作工吃饭，开除后生活不能解决，因此我女人谋自杀二次，人家吃三顿，咱们家孩子老婆吃两顿………。现在解放了，咱共产党来啦！咱们工人当了主人，咱们受的压迫就该说说，也让大家知道知道，那是好，那是坏。我明白了，共产党是咱工人的党，大家要学好，还注意那坏分子活动；努力生产，咱工人们才能改善生活，大伙说对么？”说着，他愉快的笑了。几十年的压迫，苦痛，今天被共产党解放出来。
