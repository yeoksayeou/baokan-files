(This City News) The Kailuan Coal Mine has over 50,000 workers, of whom only about 20 are British employees. However, all documents of the mine bureau are in English. Most workers do not understand English and cannot understand the documents, which affects their work. This practice is very unreasonable. Therefore, all the workers of the mine urgently demanded reform, proposing that the English language be changed to Chinese as the primary language. After receiving the report forwarded by the Tangshan City Federation of Trade Unions, the North China People's Government approved this reasonable demand and determined that, in principle, all official documents of the mine should be in Chinese as the legal language. If there are still difficulties at present, a Chinese-English comparison with Chinese as the primary language can be temporarily used. The General Military Representative Office of Kailuan Coal Mine has been ordered to negotiate with the mine and relevant parties for implementation.

　　开滦煤矿一切公文以中文为合法文字
  　华北人民政府批准职工要求
    【本市讯】开滦煤矿有职工五万多人，其中英籍职员仅二十余人，但该矿务局之各种文件均用英文，大多数职工不懂英文，无法了解，影响工作，如此做法很不合理。因此该矿全体职工迫切要求改革，提出应由用英文改为用中文为主。华北人民政府接到唐山市职工总会转来的报告，批准了这一合理的要求确定原则上该矿一切公文应以中文为合法文字，目前如尚有困难，可暂用中文为主的中英对照。已令开滦煤矿总军事代表办事处，即与该矿及有关方面洽商办理。
