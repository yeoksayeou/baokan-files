Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 14th. The French national in Tianjin, Gaisjet, used violent means last month to imprison teachers and students of the affiliated high school of Jin Gu University, obstructing their personal freedom, which aroused universal indignation among the people of Tianjin. The school affairs committee of Jin Gu Affiliated High School and the victimized teachers and students filed a complaint with the Tianjin People's Court; after accepting and trying the case, the court proved that Gaisjet was indeed guilty and sentenced him to seven days of detention on the 12th.

Gaisjet is the director of the Beijiang Museum in Tianjin. The museum had a building that had been lent to the affiliated high school of Jin Gu University as a student dormitory for ten years. In early August, without prior consultation with the school affairs committee of Jin Gu Affiliated High School, Gaisjet arbitrarily and suddenly demanded the recovery of the dormitory, sending people to move out all the bedding, iron beds and other items stored in the downstairs dormitory by students who had left school for the summer vacation, dismantling the water pipes and electrical equipment, and destroying a section of the wall. On the morning of August 14, Gaisjet personally led six or seven workers and two foreign dogs into the downstairs dormitory of Jin Gu Affiliated High School, slamming the table and roaring at the two students, Chen Zhenhai and Li Fenglu, who lived in the dormitory, demanding that they leave, declaring: "This is a French building, you cannot live in this house." Despite Chen and Li advising him to negotiate with the school authorities, Gaisjet ignored them, ordering the workers he led to move all the students' luggage, boxes and iron beds out, and letting the vicious dogs lunge and bark at Chen and Li. Then he locked the door of the room, imprisoning Chen and Li inside, and said: "Okay, if you don't go out, then don't go out, never go out." At about 1:00 PM that day, the school's student union learned of this incident and immediately sent people to visit and bring food to the imprisoned students, but Gaisjet refused. At about 4:00 PM, all fifteen members of the school affairs committee went to negotiate, but Gaisjet's attitude was extremely arrogant. When the school's director of studies, Dong Shaokang, negotiated with him, Gaisjet even attempted to lock Dong in the room. It was not until 6:00 PM, when the police chief of the Sixth Branch of the Tianjin Public Security Bureau, Wang Yongjian, and two others arrived after hearing the news, that the two students, Chen and Li, who had been imprisoned for ten hours, were finally freed. When Police Chief Wang advised Gaisjet to leave the school, Gai resisted with the arrogant attitude of an imperialist, and insulted the people's police, saying: "I have been in China for twenty-five years, and I have never walked with a Chinese policeman." Only after much persuasion did Gai leave. Afterwards, the school affairs committee of Jin Gu Affiliated High School protested to the Beijiang Museum, demanding that Gaisjet publish an apology in the newspaper and restore the downstairs dormitory to its original state, but this was rejected in a reply.

Tianjin Citizens Universally Indignant and Protest Gaisjet's Atrocities

After this incident occurred, it immediately aroused universal indignation among the 1.8 million citizens of Tianjin. The Municipal Student Federation, Youth Federation, Women's Federation, Joint Association of Primary and Secondary School Teachers and Staff, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, the troops stationed in Tianjin, and other civic groups all issued protest letters, supporting and慰问 the persecuted teachers and students of Jin Gu Affiliated High School, and unanimously demanding that Gaisjet, who dared to act arrogantly in the land of the new China with the attitude of an imperialist, be given the punishment he deserved. Students in Beiping, Tangshan and other places also responded. The Beiping Student Federation and the Tangshan Student Federation sent letters to the Tianjin Student Federation on August 20 and 22 respectively, expressing their firm support for the just struggle of Tianjin students against the oppression of Chinese students by imperialists.

On August 20, Chen Zhenhai and Li Fenglu, students of Jin Gu Affiliated High School, Dong Shaokang, director of studies, and the school affairs committee, respectively submitted indictments to the Municipal People's Court, accusing Gaisjet of his atrocities. After investigation, the People's Court opened a court session on September 1st and 2nd for trial. Gaisjet still attempted to quibble, explaining the imprisonment of students as "I notified the students to stay in the room and guard their own belongings to avoid loss" and "Do not let other students in to avoid chaos in the room." The judge pointed out that this was tantamount to proving that he did imprison the students. Gai then attempted to deny the charges by claiming that the translation of the statement of defense was incorrect; then he forged the original statement of defense, attempting to deceive the court in many ways. The People's Court, based on the fact that Gaisjet forcibly imprisoned teachers and students of Jin Gu Affiliated High School, obstructing their personal freedom, and that the facts of the crime were irrefutable, and in accordance with the basic policy of our People's Government to protect human rights, sentenced him to seven days of detention on September 12 as a form of punishment.

The Tianjin Daily published a commentary on the 13th, stating: The Chinese people have become masters in their own land, and the People's Government will never tolerate or allow foreigners to bully our people, and will never allow imperialist elements to retain any privileges in China. The headquarters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army stipulated in the "Eight Articles of Agreement" our policy towards foreigners: "Protect the safety of life and property of foreign nationals, and hope that all foreign nationals will live and work in peace and maintain order. All foreign nationals must abide by the decrees of the People's Liberation Army and the People's Government, must not engage in espionage activities, must not engage in activities against the independence of the Chinese nation and the cause of the liberation of the people, and must not harbor Chinese war criminals, counter-revolutionaries and other criminals, otherwise they will be subject to the legal sanctions of the People's Liberation Army and the People's Government." We protect law-abiding foreigners to live and work in peace, but resolutely sanction any imperialist elements who violate the decrees of our People's Government and commit wrongdoing. This is the firm and unwavering basic policy of our People's Government.

　　非法禁闭津沽附中师生案判决
    法侨盖斯杰处拘役
    中国人民不可侮！
    【新华社天津十四日电】天津法侨盖斯杰，月前以强暴手段，禁闭津沽大学附设中学师生，妨害人身自由，引起津市人民之普遍愤慨。津大附中校务委员会及该校受害师生向津市人民法院提起控诉；法院受理审讯后，证明盖斯杰犯罪属实，已于十二日判决，处以拘役七天。
    盖斯杰是津市北疆博物院院长，该院有一部楼房借给津沽大学附属中学做学生宿舍，为时已达十年。八月初，盖斯杰事先没有商经津大附中校务委员会同意，竟擅自突然要收回宿舍，派人将暑假离校学生存在楼下寝室中之被服、铁床等物悉数搬出，将水管与电灯等设备拆掉，并将墙壁凿毁一处。八月十四日晨，盖斯杰又亲率六、七名工友，并牵着两只洋狗，闯入津大附中楼下寝室内，拍桌向在该寝室居住的陈振海、李凤禄两学生大肆咆哮，要赶走他们，声言：“此系法国人之楼房，你们不能在此屋内居住。”虽经陈、李劝其向学校当局交涉，但盖斯杰置之不理，命令所率工友把学生行李、箱子和铁床悉数搬出，并放纵恶犬向陈、李扑吠，后又紧锁室门，将陈、李禁闭室内，并说：“好，你们不出去，就别出去了，永远不要出去了。”当日下午一时许，该校学生会得知此事当即派人前往探视，并带食物给被囚禁学生，但遭盖斯杰拒绝。四点钟左右，该校校务委员会全体委员十五人又前往交涉，盖斯杰态度异常蛮横，当该校教导主任董绍康与其交涉时，盖斯杰竟又企图将董关在室内。直至下午六时，津市公安局六分局警长王勇健等三人闻讯赶到后，已被囚禁达十小时之久的陈、李两学生始得恢复自由。当王警长劝令盖斯杰离校时，盖竟以帝国主义者的蛮横态度实行抗拒，并污辱人民警察说：“在中国二十五年，没有和中国警察一起走过。”后经大家多方劝告盖始离去。其后，津大附中校委会向北疆博物院提出抗议，要求盖斯杰登报道歉，并将该校楼下寝室恢复原状，又遭复函拒绝。
    天津市民普遍愤慨抗议盖斯杰的暴行
    此事件发生后，立即引起了天津市一百八十万市民的普遍愤慨，市学联、青联、妇联、中小学教职员联合会、市总工会、驻津部队及其他各界市民团体都纷纷发表抗议书，支援和慰问被迫害的津沽附中师生，并一致要求给竟敢在人民新中国的土地上以帝国主义者态度横行霸道的盖斯杰以应有的惩罚。北平、唐山等地学生也纷纷响应。北平学联、唐山学联分别于八月二十日，二十二日致函天津学联，表示坚决支持天津同学反抗帝国主义者压迫中国学生的正义斗争。
    八月二十日，津沽附中学生陈振海、李凤禄、教导主任董绍康及该校校务委员会，分别向本市人民法院呈递控诉书，控告盖斯杰的暴行。人民法院经过调查后，即于九月一、二两日开庭审讯，盖斯杰仍图狡辩，将禁闭学生事件解释为“我通知学生、须留在屋内、看守自己物件，以免发生遗失”及“不要其他学生进去，避免屋中太乱”。审判官指出这无异自行证明其确有囚禁学生行为。盖又借口辩诉状译文错误，企图抵赖；继又伪造辩诉状原本，对法庭进行多方欺骗。人民法院以盖斯杰以暴力禁闭津沽附中师生，妨害人身自由，犯罪事实已属确凿，无容抵赖，遂依据我人民政府保障人权之基本政策，于九月十二日判决，处以七日拘役，以示惩戒。
    天津日报十三日对此发表评论称：中国人民在自己的土地上作了主人，人民政府绝不容忍和允许外侨欺凌我人民，绝不允许帝国主义分子在中国还保有什么特权。中国人民解放军总部在“约法八章”中，规定了我们对待外侨的政策：“保护外国侨民生命财产的安全，希望一切外国侨民各安生业，保持秩序。一切外国侨民，必须遵守人民解放军及人民政府的法令，不得进行间谍活动，不得有反对中国民族独立及人民解放事业的行为，不得包庇中国战争罪犯、反革命分子及其他罪犯，否则当受人民解放军与人民政府的法律制裁。”我们保护守法的外侨各安生业，但坚决制裁那些违犯我人民政府法令，为非作歹的任何帝国主义分子，这是我人民政府坚定不移的基本方针。
