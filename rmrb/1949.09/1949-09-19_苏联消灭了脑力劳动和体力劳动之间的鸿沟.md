　　The Soviet Union Eliminates the Gap Between Mental and Manual Labor
　　By Geli Gelin Ke, translated by Jun Qiang

　　This article is a reply from Pravda to reader Sergei Yev's question: "What is the opposition between mental and manual labor? How can this opposition be eliminated?" The following is a reprint.

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
　　The opposition between mental and manual labor is one of the forms of social division of labor. This form of division is unique to all exploiting societies and is particularly acute in the capitalist era.

　　The capitalist system condemns the people to a fate of enslavement and immense suffering. The doors of education and science are closed to the laborers. Science, art, and culture – all of these are the privileges of the ruling class. Workers and peasants are doomed only to engage in manual labor. Only the privileged few and intellectuals can engage in mental labor. At the same time, intellectuals in bourgeois society are also composed of the propertied class. Capitalism clearly divides work into "black" and "white," turning the working people into appendages of machines, creating a gap between mental and manual labor.

　　To eradicate this gap, the only way is to eliminate capitalism. The Soviet experience is irrefutable evidence of this. The great October Socialist Revolution overthrew the regime of landlords and capitalists, making our working class the ruling class. This revolution liberated the laborers from the shackles of exploitation, enabled the lowest levels of the people to participate in state management, actively participate in the field of socio-political life, and promoted a large number of outstanding organizers from the ranks of workers and peasants, opening up the path of education for the laborers.

　　The great Lenin continued to develop and enrich Marx and Engels' brilliant exposition on the two stages of communism. He comprehensively raised the issue of the path from socialist society to communist society. Based on the rich experience of Soviet socialist construction, Comrade Stalin, the great successor to Lenin's cause, for the first time in history, studied the specific program of communist construction, and at the same time, studied the issue of eliminating the opposition between mental and manual labor. Comrade Stalin, through in-depth analysis of the Stakhanovite movement, proved that in order to fundamentally eradicate this opposition, it is essential to raise the cultural and technical level of the masses of workers and peasants to the level of engineers and technical workers. Comrade Stalin pointed out that the Stakhanovite movement paved the way for communism and also nurtured the seeds of the working class improving its cultural and technical skills – this is the path to eliminate the opposition between mental and manual labor.

　　Relying on the efforts of the Communist Party and the Soviet government, a true cultural revolution has been realized in the Soviet Union. Comrade Stalin gave the cultural revolution new and important tasks at the 18th Congress of the Communist Party (Bolsheviks): "We must make all workers and peasants cultured, educated, and we will do this in a timely manner."

　　Everyone can see that Stalin's words have been successfully realized. How eloquently do the facts and figures speak of this! The Soviet Union has eliminated illiteracy. In 1948, there were 33.2 million children studying in Soviet primary and secondary schools; nearly 750,000 college students were in higher education institutions. In addition, millions of people are studying in various schools and training classes without leaving production. In Soviet society, one-third of the people are studying.

　　There are clubs, libraries, cultural palaces, theaters, cinemas, and a radio communication network, as well as millions of copies of newspapers, magazines, and books published – all of this is used to improve the cultural and technical level of laborers.

　　The victory of socialism and the elimination of the exploiting classes have also eliminated the class basis of the opposition between mental and manual labor. One of the most important achievements of the cultural revolution is the emergence of many Soviet intellectuals. These are new types of socialist intellectuals, emerging from the people, closely linked to the people, and building a communist society alongside the workers and peasants. The formation and growth of Soviet people's intellectuals marks that the boundary between mental and manual labor is being eliminated.

　　Due to the Communist Party and the Soviet government's enormous educational work, the ideological level of the Soviet people has grown immeasurably, raising their conscious awareness and creating a new spiritual outlook for the Soviet people. The Communist Party's worldview has deeply penetrated the consciousness of the Soviet people.

　　The establishment of the socialist economic system has guaranteed the rapid advancement of the cultural and technical level of the laborers; this economic system has also endowed the Soviet people with all possibilities to develop their strength, talent, and creative initiative.

　　Another basic condition for eradicating the opposition between mental and manual labor is the material and technical basis of production. At the same time, in bourgeois society, technological advancement is only used to strengthen the exploitation of laborers; but in socialist society, all achievements of science and technology are used by the Party and the government to alleviate labor conditions and increase labor productivity. The continuous growth of labor productivity is a decisive condition for successfully building communism and eliminating the boundary between mental and manual labor. Whether in cities or rural areas, the mechanization, automation, and electrification of production processes alleviate human labor and also improve people's cultural and technical level.

　　Our Stakhanovite workers are millions of such laborers: they possess modern production technology and culture, and promote their continued progress. They contribute to rationalized improvements, they are creators of outstanding inventions, creators of many methods for improving labor productivity; they widely apply the achievements of science and technology, and appear as innovators in industry, transportation, and agriculture, enriching science and technology and promoting them forward. The Stakhanovites' speeches and pamphlets on experience and work, their reports at scientific and technological conferences, their close cooperation with scholars to strive for technological improvement, as well as a large number of socialist labor heroes and Stakhanovites who won Stalin Prizes – all of this indicates that mental and manual labor are organically integrated in the work of advanced workers and peasants.

　　The victory of socialism has eliminated the gap between mental and manual labor, but the distinctions between them still exist in socialist society. The opposition between them can only be completely eradicated in communist society.

　　More than forty years ago, Comrade Stalin foresaw that the communist system would be such a society: "In this society, the division of 'black' and 'white', the contradiction between mental and manual labor, is completely eliminated..."

　　Now, under the leadership of the Bolshevik Party and guided by the great Stalin, the Soviet people are successfully building such a society.

　　苏联消灭了脑力劳动和体力劳动之间的鸿沟
    哥里果林可著君强译
    本文系真理报答复读者塞尔该也夫的问题：“什么是脑力劳动和体力劳动间的对立呢？这个对立怎样才能消灭？”兹转载如次。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    脑力劳动和体力劳动中间的对立，是社会分工的形式之一。这种分工形式，是一切有剥削的社会所特有的，在资本主义时代，表现得特殊尖锐。
    资本主义制度，宣判了人民被奴役的命运和莫大的痛苦，教育和科学之门，对于劳动者是关闭着的。科学、艺术、文化——这一切都是统治阶级的特权。工人和农民，却只有从事体力劳动的命运。具有特权的少数人和知识分子才能从事脑力劳动。同时资产阶级社会中的知识分子，也是有产阶级组成的，资本主义清楚地把工作分为“黑色的”和“白色的”，使劳动人民变成机器的附属品，在脑力劳动和体力劳动之间，造成了鸿沟。
    要想铲除这个鸿沟，就唯有消灭资本主义。苏联的经验，就是这件事的确凿无比的证据。伟大的十月社会主义革命，推翻了地主和资本家的政权，使我国工人阶级，成为统治阶级。这个革命，使劳动者从剥削桎梏中解放出来，使最下层的人民，参与国家管理，积极参加社会政治生活领域，它还从工人农民的行列中，擢升了大量优秀的组织者，给劳动者开辟了受教育的道路。
    伟大的列宁，把马克思恩格斯关于共产主义两个阶段的天才论述，继续发展，继续丰富了。他概括地提出了从社会主义社会过渡到共产主义社会的道路问题，在推广苏联社会主义建设丰富的经验基础上，列宁事业的伟大继承者斯大林同志，在历史上第一次地研究了共产主义建设的具体纲领，同时，还研究了关于消灭脑力劳动和体力劳动对立的问题。斯大林同志由于对斯达汗诺夫运动的深刻分析，证明出要想根绝这种对立，基本上要把工农群众的文化技术水平，提高到工程师技术工作者的水平才成。斯大林同志指出，斯达汗诺夫运动，为共产主义铺设了道路，同时还孕育了工人阶级提高文化技术的种子——这是引导消灭脑力劳动和体力劳动间对立的道路。
    依赖于共产党和苏维埃政府的努力，在苏联实现了真正的文化革命。斯大林同志在联共（布）第十八次会议中，给文化革命以新的重大的任务：“我们要使所有的工人和农民成为有文化的，成为受过教育的，并且我们将及时地做这件事情。”
    每个人都看得见，斯大林的话，是成功地实现了。事实和数字，是怎样雄辩地说出了这件事啊！苏联已经扫除了文盲，一九四八年，在苏联的中小学校中，有三千三百二十万儿童在学习；高等学校中，有将近七十五万大学生。此外还有数百万人，在不脱离生产的情况下，在各式各样的学校和讲习班中研究。在苏维埃社会中，有三分之一的人正在学习着。
    有俱乐部、图书馆、文化宫、剧院、影院和无线电联络站网、还有出版数百万份的报纸、杂志、书籍——所有这一切，那是作为提高劳动者文化技术水平之用。
    社会主义的胜利，剥削阶级的消灭，也就消灭了脑力劳动和体力劳动对立的阶级基础。文化革命最重要的成果之一，就是产生出了许许多多的苏维埃知识分子。这是新型的社会主义知识分子，从人民中间产生出来的，密切地和人民联系着，并且和工农群众并肩建设共产主义社会的知识分子。苏维埃人民的知识分子的形成和生长，标志出脑力劳动和体力劳动的界线，是在消灭着。
    由于共产党和苏维埃政府巨大的教育工作，使苏维埃人民的思想水平，不可限量地生长了，提高了他们的自觉意识，创造出苏维埃人民新型的精神面目。共产党的世界观，深深地渗入苏维埃人民的意识中。
    社会主义经济制度的创立，保证了劳动者文化技术水平的猛进；这个经济制度，还赋与了苏维埃人民发展自己的力量，天才和创造性倡导的一切可能性。
    根绝脑力劳动和体力劳动对立的另一基本条件，就是生产的物质技术基础。同时，在资产阶级的社会中，技术的增进，只是利用以加强对劳动者的剥削；但在社会主义的社会中，科学和技术的一切成就，都是由党和政府，用来作为减轻劳动条件，并提高劳动生产力之用。劳动生产力的不断增长——是成功地建设共产主义，消灭脑力劳动和体力劳动的界限的具有决定性的条件。无论在城市和乡村中，生产程序的机械化、自动化、电气化，减轻了人的劳动，同时也提高了人们的文化技术水平。
    我们的斯达汗诺夫工作者——是数百万这样的劳动者：他们具备了现代的生产技术和文化，并推动这些继续向前进步。他们促成了合理化的改进，他们是卓越发明的创造者，是许多提高劳动生产力方法的创造者；他们广泛地应用着科学和技术的成就，无论在工业中，在运输中，在农业中，都以革新者的姿态出现，使科学和技术更加丰富起来，推动它们向前。斯达汗诺夫者们，关于经验和工作的讲演和小册子，他们在科学技术代表会上的报告，他们和学者密切合作来争取技术的改善，以及大量的社会主义劳动英雄和获得斯大林奖金的斯达汗诺夫者们——所有这一切标明着，在先进的工人和农民的工作中，把脑力劳动和体力劳动，有机地融合在一起了。
    社会主义的胜利，消除了脑力劳动和体力劳动之间的鸿沟，但是它们之间的区别，在社会主义的社会中，仍然存在着，它们之间的对立，唯有在共产主义社会中，才能完全根绝。
    距今四十多年以前，斯大林同志就预见到，共产主义制度——是这样的一个社会：“在这个社会中，‘黑色的’和‘白色的’分工，脑力劳动和体力劳动的矛盾，是完全地消灭了……”
    现在，苏维埃人民，在布尔塞维克党领导下，在伟大的斯大林引导之下，已经成功地建设着这样的社会。
