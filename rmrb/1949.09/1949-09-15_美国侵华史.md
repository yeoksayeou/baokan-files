　　A History of American Aggression Against China
    Liu Danian
  　III. Contending for Hegemony in China
  　(Continued from XVI)
    As the Northern Expeditionary Army continued to advance and British and Japanese forces retreated one after another, the United States followed its predetermined plan to find an object within the revolutionary camp who could serve as a new running dog. This turned out to be none other than Chiang Kai-shek, who had already launched the "Zhongshan Warship Incident," exposed his true face as a large landlord and comprador, and was preparing to kick away the people and monopolize the fruits of the revolution. In the winter of 1926, after Chiang Kai-shek arrived in Nanchang, the United States, in collaboration with Britain, sent Yu Qiaqing, a Chinese director of the Shanghai British Concession, a fellow Ningbo native of Chiang Kai-shek, and the chairman of the Shanghai Stock Exchange where Chiang had once stayed, to Nanchang to negotiate with Chiang. They offered him 60 million yuan after he reached Shanghai and Nanjing, on the condition that he oppose and eliminate the communists (Note: Yi Xun: Inside Story of the Chiang Clique, published in Shandong Xinhua Digest, Volume 2, Issue 9). This American strategy proved effective. On November 21 of the same year, Chiang Kai-shek met with foreign journalists and openly "expressed his friendship toward the United States" (Note: The Eastern Miscellany, Volume 24, Issue 2). The American aggressors were experienced, and they did not believe that the time for Chiang Kai-shek's betrayal was ripe, so they still used double-dealing tactics to promote it. In mid-January 1927, as the revolutionary army moved east along the Yangtze River, the U.S. government ordered Admiral V. Williams, commander of the Asiatic Fleet, to lead all ships, including those stationed in Honolulu and Suez, to Shanghai within twelve hours from Manila (Note: The Eastern Miscellany, Volume 24, Issue 5.) and proposed to Britain to jointly blockade the Yangtze River, giving Chiang Kai-shek a blow. Two weeks later, Secretary of State Kellogg issued a declaration on China policy on the pretext of tariffs, saying that the United States was "prepared to begin negotiations with any government or representative who can speak for China" (Note: January 27, 1927, U.S. Declaration on China Policy, The Eastern Miscellany, Volume 24, Issue 4.) This implied that they could start negotiations with Chiang Kai-shek to pull him over, making Chiang Kai-shek's preparations for betraying the revolution more active. Then, on March 24, the United States, in conjunction with Britain, bombarded Nanjing, creating the so-called "Nanjing Incident," to suppress the revolutionary army in Wuhan and reduce the obstacles to Chiang Kai-shek's betrayal. At the same time, it was also a warning to Chiang Kai-shek to surrender quickly. As a result, Chiang Kai-shek launched the "April 12th" coup in Shanghai, completely exposing his face of surrendering to imperialism and betraying the revolution. On the 18th, he organized the so-called "National Government" in Nanjing, using Wu Chaoshu, the son of the old pro-American faction Wu Tingfang, as the first foreign minister, and issued a diplomatic policy of selling out the country with glittering words: (1) not to take violent means; (2) to propose the abolition of unequal treaties at an appropriate time; (3) to overthrow imperialism without excluding foreigners (Note: The Eastern Miscellany, Volume 24, Issue 13). Chiang Kai-shek's initial success in this counter-revolution was also the initial success of the American aggressors in using the Chinese revolution to turn around and strangle the revolution. However, the American plan to use Chiang Kai-shek as a new tool was not fully realized at this time, because Japan had the same connections with Chiang Kai-shek. In the winter of 1926, Chiang secretly sent Dai Jitao as a representative to Japan, which caused suspicion in the United States. As a result, Chiang Kai-shek was forced to "step down" in the autumn of 1927 due to the lack of active support from the United States.
    On September 28 of the same year, Chiang "went abroad" to Japan. This was naturally a good opportunity for the United States. The American representative in Japan signed a secret agreement with Chiang Kai-shek: the United States would support Chiang Kai-shek's return to power, and Chiang would officially act as the agent of the American aggressors in China, and he would humbly meet with the Japanese "Emperor" and recognize Japan's special interests in Northeast China and the "Nishihara Loans," etc., as an exchange condition for Japan's non-opposition to his return to power. Although the clauses of this secret US-Chiang agreement have not yet been revealed, Chiang Kai-shek's actions after returning to China have provided concrete proof.
    After Chiang returned to Shanghai in November 1927, the first important thing he did was to seize Soong May-ling as his wife from Liu Jiwen, another "member of the Central Committee" of the Kuomintang, on December 1 with the most shameless conditions (according to rumors, the conditions were: 1. Liu Jiwen would be the mayor of Nanjing; 2. Liu would receive one million yuan in cash; 3. Soong May-ling and Liu would maintain their original relationship). He established a flesh-and-blood connection with the United States through the old American comprador Soong family. Chiang's family newspaper celebrated greatly, calling it a "political victory for the Kuomintang." Chiang Kai-shek himself also declared, "After our marriage, the work of 'revolution' must have greater development," etc. (Note: The quoted material from the previous sentence is not in hand, but the general idea is similar. The latter sentence can be found in John Gunther's Inside Asia, Volume 1, page 372.) The second thing was the publication of a speech changing the foreign policy on December 13 (Note: The Eastern Miscellany, Volume 25, Issue 3.) Immediately, the Nanjing government ordered the revocation of recognition of Russian consuls in various places, and "strictly arrested" Russian communists, re-establishing a pro-American diplomatic line. In the note from the Nanjing government to the United States on March 30 of the following year, this line was written as: "The Minister of Foreign Affairs of the National Government hopes that the United States and China will open a new era in diplomacy." The third thing was the appointment of Soong Tzu-wen as the Minister of Finance of the Nanjing government on January 7, 1928, to strengthen the American economic and political position in Nanjing. Finally, on the 9th of the same month, Chiang Kai-shek announced "continuing to exercise the powers of the Commander-in-Chief of the National Revolutionary Army (Note: The highest power possessed by the running dog of American aggression against China)". All of this was the effect of the secret US-Chiang agreement.
    As soon as Chiang Kai-shek came to power, the United States immediately put on the airs of a master toward a slave, asking him to reverse the truth of the crimes of the American warships bombarding Nanjing the previous year, which killed and injured more than 2,000 people, and recognize them as the "atrocities" of the Chinese people, especially to put this hat on the head of the Chinese Communists, as a test of Chiang Kai-shek's loyalty to the United States. U.S. Minister to China J.V.A. MacMurray sent the following note to the Chiang Kai-shek government:
    "The Minister is convinced that all the 'criminals' (?!), especially Lin Zuhan, who is personally responsible, must be punished as soon as possible and completely in accordance with the expression, in order to show the Nanjing authorities' relationship with the American and Chinese people in other aspects..." (Note: April 4, 1928, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the National Government published documents on the settlement of the Nanjing Incident between China and the United States.)
    Chiang Kai-shek's response at the time was to repeatedly "deeply apologize" for the "disrespectful acts" to the United States, and also "assume full compensation" (Note: Ibid.) This completely proves that the servility of this new running dog is very reliable. Since 1926, the American plan to use the Chinese revolution to destroy the revolution has been successfully realized. From then on, Chiang Kai-shek became the only favorite dog of American imperialism in China, and all American activities to invade China were carried out through this favorite dog and its group, and Chiang Kai-shek mainly used the United States as his backstage to engage in all anti-communist and anti-people actions. Japan separately kept a Wang Jingwei to confront Chiang Kai-shek. The struggle between the United States and Japan for hegemony in China was often manifested as the struggle between Chiang Kai-shek and Wang Jingwei.
    At this time, the American slogan of aggression began to advance further, emphasizing not "open door," but China's "unification," because Japan and Britain, France, and other countries could no longer implement the closure of the door to the United States. His running dog Chiang Kai-shek also styled himself as having the title of "Central," and the "unification" of all new and old warlord forces supported by Japan to the "Central" naturally meant unification to the United States. On July 24, 1928, U.S. Secretary of State Kellogg issued a note, stating that he was "confident that a unified new China is emerging after years of internal strife," and that the "related countries" could only rely on this "unified" government to increase its interests (Note: 1933, Shen Bao Yearbook). This was to restore the American desire to completely expel Japan from China before the failure of the Zhili faction.
    Japan was clearly not prepared to retreat. As soon as the United States began to collude with Chiang Kai-shek, the Tanaka cabinet clearly stated that "to control China, it is necessary to overthrow American forces as a prerequisite, which is very similar to the meaning of the Russo-Japanese War" (Note: Abridged translation of the Tanaka cabinet's active policy toward Manchuria and Mongolia, Propaganda Series of the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Kuomintang, page 4). Then, it sent troops to Shandong twice, occupied Jinan, and bombed Zhang Zuolin, who had connections with American capital (Note: See Zeng Zongmeng, The Painful History of the September 18th Anniversary, Volume 1, page 12, and The Eastern Miscellany, Volume 30, Issue 16, S. Dashinsky, The Political and Economic Background of Japanese Foreign Aggression, Yang Yuting's statement to foreign reporters on November 29, 1927, etc.). It pressured Zhang Xueliang to "declare independence" in Northeast China, creating a split movement that was exactly the opposite of American "unification." Northeast China was a piece of fat that the United States and Japan had repeatedly fought for since 1905. Therefore, they could not ignore this. Through Chiang Kai-shek, Fang Benren was sent to Fengtian on August 9, 1928, to persuade Zhang Xueliang to "change the flag." The Japanese side also sent Hayashi Gonsuke, ostensibly to attend Zhang Zuolin's funeral, and threatened Zhang Xueliang in various ways. On the 12th of the same month, Zhang Xueliang and Hayashi Gonsuke met for the last time, stating that he would postpone his obedience to the "National Government." Knowing that Chiang Kai-shek was unable to do anything, the United States quickly took action personally. U.S. Minister MacMurray went to Fengtian on the 13th under the pretext of going to Korea, and met with Zhang Xueliang's representative Yang Yuting at the U.S. Consulate. Zhang Xueliang's attitude completely changed again. On the 25th of the same month, he sent his representative Xing Shilian to Shanghai to tell Chiang Kai-shek: "There is no question that the three provinces will obey the National Government (Note: Obey the American aggressors)." (Note: The Eastern Miscellany, Volume 25, Issue 20.) Finally, on December 29, Zhang Xueliang issued a telegram of "changing the flag," and the American "unification" movement in China achieved its first effect.

　　美国侵华史

  　三　争夺中国霸权
  　（续十六）
    及北伐军继续前进，日英势力纷纷败退，美国也就按预定计划，在革命阵营中寻找能够胜任这个新走狗的对象。找到的不是别人，就是当时已发动“中山舰事件”，暴露出大地主、大买办真实面目，准备踢开人民独占革命果实的蒋介石。当一九一六年冬天蒋介石到南昌后，美国便联合英国，派上海英租界华董，蒋介石宁波同乡及蒋曾经寄食的上海交易所理事长虞洽卿到南昌去与蒋谈判，允许到上海南京后给他六千万元款子，而以反共灭共为条件（注：翊勋：蒋党内幕，载山东新华文摘，二卷九期。）美国这一谋略果然有效，同年十一月二十一日蒋介石接见外国新闻记者发表谈话，就公开“表示对美国友谊”（注：东方杂志二四卷二号）。美国侵略者是老练的，它并不以为蒋介石叛变时机已经成熟，还须用两面手段促成。一九二七年一月中旬，革命军沿长江东下，美政府命亚洲舰队司令维廉，在马尼拉率全部连驻火鲁奴，苏彝士各舰在内，以十二小时赶赴上海（注：东方杂志二四卷五号。）且向英国提议共同封锁长江，给蒋介石一个打击。两个星期之后，又由国务卿凯洛借关税为题，发表一个对华政策宣言，说是美国“准备与中国任何政府或可代表中国发言之代表开始谈判”（注：一九二七年一月二十七日，美国对华政策宣言，东方杂志二四卷四号。）即暗示可与蒋介石开始谈判来拉他一把，使蒋介石叛变革命的准备更加积极。接着美国又于三月二十四日联合英国炮击南京，制造所谓“南京事件”，对武汉革命军队加以压迫，减少蒋介石叛变的障碍，同时也是警告蒋介石，投降要赶快实行。于是，蒋介石在上海发动“四·一二”政变，把他投降帝国主义叛卖革命的面目，完全公开，十八日在南京组织所谓“国民政府”，用老亲美派伍廷芳的儿子伍朝枢为第一任外交部长，发表闪铄其词的卖国外交政策：（一）不取暴动手段；（二）于相当时期提议废止不平等条约；（三）打倒帝国主义非排外性质（注：东方杂志二四卷一三号）。蒋介石这种反革命的初步成功，也就是美国侵略者利用中国革命，反过来又绞杀这个革命的初步成功。但美国要以蒋介石作为新工具的计划，这时还不是全部实现，因为日本与蒋介石有同样瓜葛，一九二六年冬天，蒋就秘密派戴季陶为代表去了日本，使美国发生疑虑，结果，蒋介石因得不到美国积极支持而在一九二七年秋天被迫“下野”。
    同年九月二十八日蒋“出洋”到了日本。这自然是美国一个很好的机会，由美国驻在日本的代表，与蒋介石立一秘约：美国支持蒋介石重新上台，蒋则正式充当美国侵略者在中国的代理人，并让他卑躬屈节去见日本“天皇”，承认日本在东北的特殊利益及“西原借款”等，来作为日本不反对他上台的交换条件。这个美蒋秘约条文，虽然现在还没有泄露，但蒋介石回国以后的行动，却给予了切实的证明。
    一九二七年十一月蒋回抵上海，他所做第一件重要的事就是于十二月一日以最无耻的条件从国民党的另一位“中委”刘纪文手中夺得宋美龄为妻（据传说其条件为：一，以刘纪文为南京市长；二，给刘现金一百万元；三，宋美龄与刘保持原来关系）。通过美国老买办宋氏家族与美国取得血肉连系。蒋家报纸大事庆祝，称为“国民党政治胜利”，蒋介石自己也宣称“我们结婚后，‘革命’的工作一定要有更大的开展”云云。（注：所引前句材料不在手中，大意如此，后句见美约翰·干瑟著亚洲内幕，上卷，三七二页。）第二件事是十二月十三日发表变更对外方针谈话（注：东方杂志二五卷三号。）马上由南京政府下令撤消对各地俄国领事的承认，并“严拿”俄籍共产党人，重新确定亲美外交路线。在以后三月三十日南京政府致美照会中把这个路线写做：“国民政府外交部长希望中美两国在外交上开一新纪元”。第三件事是一九二八年一月七日以宋子文为南京政府财政部长，加强美国在南京的经济和政治地位。最后蒋介石于同月九日宣布“继续行使国民革命军总司令职权（按：美国侵略中国的走狗所拥有的最高职权）”。这一切，就是美蒋密约所发生的效果。
    蒋介石一登场，美国立刻摆出主人对奴才的架子，要他把上年美舰炮击南京死伤二千余人的罪恶，颠倒黑白，承认为中国人民“暴行”，尤其把这帽子戴在中国共产党人头上，作为蒋介石对美忠实程度的测验。美驻华公使马瑞慕以下面的照会送给蒋介石政府：
    “本公使深信，所有该事件各‘犯’（？！），尤以亲身负责之林祖涵一名为最要，其惩办一层必能依照表示从速完全履行，借以表明南京当局对于中美两国人民他方面之关系……。”（注：民国十七年四月四日，国民政府外交部发表中美解决宁案交涉文件。）
    当时蒋介石的答复是除对美国“不敬之处”再三“深示歉意”外，又“担任充分赔偿”（注：同上件。）完全证明这个新走狗的奴性十分可靠。一九二六年以来，美国利用中国革命又破坏革命的侵略计划，遂圆满实现。从此蒋介石成了美帝国主义在中国所豢养的唯一宠犬，美国一切侵略中国的活动都通过这只宠犬和它的集团来进行，而蒋介石也就主要以美国为后台，来从事一切反共反人民的施为。日本则另外畜了一个汪精卫以与蒋介石对抗。美日争夺中国霸权的斗争，在许多场合又表现为蒋介石与汪精卫的斗争。
    这时美国的侵略口号开始进一步，所强调的不再为“门户开放”，而是中国的“统一”，因为日本和英、法等国，都已不可能对美国实行门户关闭，它的走狗蒋介石又自封有“中央”名号，把日本支持下的一切新旧军阀势力“统一”给“中央”，自然也就是统一到美国手里。一九二八年七月二十四日美国务卿凯洛发表一件照会，表示“确信中国经频年内争之后，一统一的新中国正在发现之中”，各“关系国”只有依赖这个“统一”政府才能增进它的利益（注：民国二十二年，申报年鉴）。这是恢复直系失败前美国完全驱逐日本出中国的愿望。
    日本显然不准备退却，美国一开始与蒋介石勾结，田中内阁就明确提出“欲制支那，必以打倒美国势力为先决问题，与日俄战争之意大同小异”（注：节译田中内阁对满蒙积极政策，国民党山西省委宣传丛书本，四页）。接着两次出兵山东，占领济南，又炸死与美国资本发生了连系的张作霖（注：参看曾宗孟编九一八周年痛史上卷一二页及东方杂志三○卷一六号Ｓ．Ｄａｓｈｉｎｓｋｙ．日本对外侵略之政治经济背景，一九二七年十一月二十九日杨宇霆向外报记者声明等。）压迫张学良在东北“独立”，来一个与美国“统一”恰相对立的分裂运动。东北是一九○五年以后美国跟日本屡争不得的一块肥肉，对此自不能忽视，通过蒋介石于一九二八年八月九日派方本仁到奉天劝张学良“易帜”。日本方面亦派林权助借参加张作霖葬仪前往，对张学良多方威胁，同月十二日张学良与林权助最后会见，表示服从“国民政府”可以从缓。美国既知道蒋介石无能为力，就迅速亲自出马，由美使马瑞慕以赴朝鲜为名，于十三日抵奉天，与张学良代表杨宇霆会见于美领事馆，张学良态度又完全变化，同月二十五日派代表邢士廉到上海告诉蒋介石：“三省服从国民政府（按：服从美国侵略者）不成问题。”（注：东方杂志二五卷二○号。）最后十二月二十九日张学良发表了“改旗易帜”通电，美国在中国的“统一”运动，第一次收到效果。
