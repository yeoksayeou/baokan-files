Electric Tram Company Repair Factory Workers
　Set Specific Economy Plan
　Savings of One Million Yuan More Than Last Month This Month
　　[This Municipality News] All the workers of the Electric Tram Company Repair Factory have now drawn up a production and economy plan. It is estimated that this month's savings will be more than one million yuan compared to last month. In order to ensure the thorough completion of the savings plan, the factory will gradually establish the following three systems: (1) Inspection system and standard specifications for parts. (2) Labor discipline. (3) Overhaul system. The savings plans formulated by each section of the factory mainly focus on three aspects: utilizing waste materials, using substitutes, and saving materials. In terms of utilizing waste materials, since July, the electricians have been collecting and patching together the scraps of fire-resistant glass and chicken feather paper that were previously thrown away, replacing some new materials. In September, they plan to make more use of old materials, which can save 110,000 yuan. The machinists open and roll flat the waste condenser copper tubes that are not used by the power plant to make resistance eyelets, etc., which can reduce the purchase of 700 kilograms of new copper skin. Secondly, they use the waste herringbone frame dismantled from the towed vehicles to remake the locomotive herringbone wood, which can save 480 kilograms of raw iron. The two items can save more than 4.7 million yuan in total. In terms of using substitutes, the electricians use adhesive tape, yellow wax cloth, white tape, and other materials to wrap insulating columns, and coat them with insulating paint to replace fire-resistant glass tubes. Based on 30 tubes per month, this can save 600,000 yuan this month. Asbestos paper, which is used to replace imported thick asbestos board for resistance, used to be 50 kilograms per month, but now it is only 30 kilograms, and the rest is replaced by wooden boards coated with insulating paint, which can save 60,000 yuan this month. In terms of saving materials, the foundry used to open the furnace 15 times a month, consuming 30 cans of copper. Now, it is changed to 10 times, reducing the lunch break time and working continuously, also consuming 30 cans, which can save one ton of coke per month. The forging workers add fine coal to the coal burning and repair the furnace once a week, saving one and a half tons of bituminous coal per month. The two items can save a total of 170,000 yuan. The machinists plan to reduce the replenishment of 200 inches of new files this month and make more use of chopped files (that is, reprocessed old files), which can save 200,000 yuan. The car frame section has been saving month by month in terms of using green oil and wool yarn since May. This month, the workers tighten the oil pot lid and mix the wool yarn with oil before putting it into the oil pot (previously, it was put into the pot and then filled with oil, which was both oil-consuming and yarn-consuming). They plan to reduce the oil consumption from 0.63 kg in August to 0.57 kg, and the yarn consumption from 0.28 kg in August to 0.21 kg, which can save a total of 280,000 yuan. According to this savings plan, in addition to the labor costs saved by improving efficiency and the consumption of parts, September can save more than one million yuan compared to August.

　　电车公司修造厂职工
  　订具体节约计划
  　本月将较上月节约百万元
    【本市讯】电车公司修造厂全体职工，现已订出生产节约计划。预计本月可较上月节约一百余万元。该厂为保证节约计划的彻底完成，将逐步建立下列三项制度：（一）检查制度及机件标准规格。（二）劳动纪律。（三）检修制度。该厂各股所订的节约计划，主要的是从利用废料、使用代用品、节约材料三方面入手。在利用废料方面，电工股从七月起，已将以前扔掉的火玻璃和鸡毛纸的零头，检回拼凑贴用，代替一部分新的。九月份他们计划更多的利用旧料，可节约十一万元，机工股把发电厂不用的废凝结器铜管冲开轧薄，做阻力眼圈等，这样约可少购新铜皮七百公斤，其次是用以前拖车拆下的废人字板架改制机车人字木，可节省元铁四百八十公斤。两项共计可节约四百七十多万元。在使用代用品方面，电工们改用胶布黄蜡布白带子等物缠成绝缘立柱，外涂隔电漆，代替火玻璃管，以每月三十管计，本月可节省六十万元。代替外来厚石棉板作阻力用的石棉纸，过去每月用五十公斤，现在只用三十公斤，其余用木板涂隔电漆代替，本月可节省六万元。在节约材料方面，以前铸工每月开炉十五次，化铜三十罐，现改开十次，减少中午休息时间，连续工作，也化三十罐，一月可节省焦炭一吨。锻工烧煤加细，每周修炉一次，一月可省烟煤一吨半。两项一共可省十七万元。机工本月计划少补充新锉二百英寸，多利用剁锉（即旧锉重加工者），可省二十万元。架车股在用青油和羊毛线方面，从五月起，已逐月节约，本月，工人把油壶盖紧，把毛线先拌油再放入油壶（以前放入壶内再注油，又费油又费线）。准备把用油量由八月份○·六三公斤减至○·五七公斤，用线量由八月份○·二八公斤减至○·二一公斤，共可节省二十八万元。按照这次的节约计划，除了提高效率所节约人工费和机件的消耗量以外，九月份比八月份又可节约一百多万元。
