　　China New Legal Research Institute Relaxes Procedures for Researchers to Apply for Admission
　　[This Newspaper’s Report] Since the China New Legal Research Institute began recruiting researchers in Peiping, legal professionals from all over the country have placed boundless hopes on it. However, the institute's regulations regarding admission procedures, particularly the requirement to hold a "letter of introduction from revolutionary organs, troops, schools, groups, or democratic parties at the provincial or municipal level," was perceived as difficult. Now, to facilitate applications from former judicial personnel, the institute has broadened the scope of acceptable letters of introduction. It now states that anyone holding a letter of introduction from the person in charge of a revolutionary organ, troops, school, or group at the county or municipal level, or from the initiators of the New Legal Research Association, responsible for proving that they "have no bad habits and no counter-revolutionary or corrupt activities," may apply for admission.
