  　Fourth Field Army Celebrates Opening of the CPPCC
    [Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 26th] The entire officers and soldiers of the Fourth Field Army of the Chinese People's Liberation Army are celebrating the opening of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) with fervent hearts and strong fighting will. After hearing the news of the CPPCC's opening, a certain army of the front-line troops immediately convened symposiums at their respective驻地 (zhùdì - stationed location/barracks) to express their warm congratulations. At the symposiums of heroic models and meritorious personnel, Wang Rencheng, a combat model, said: "We have been fighting the Kuomintang reactionaries for several years, and we have been looking forward to the establishment of the Central People's Government like children look forward to the New Year. Now that this government is established, I feel happy from the bottom of my heart. I must lead my class well, unite as one, overcome all difficulties, and liberate all the people who have not yet been liberated." Chen Tianqing, a model of observing discipline and cherishing the people, said: "This time the CPPCC is meeting, it means the suffering of the poor has come to an end. This is truly a great joyful event beyond words. We must quickly eliminate the remnants of the Chiang Kai-shek and Bai Chongxi bandits, and celebrate the establishment of the Central People's Government with victories and great merits." A certain division guarding Wuhan carefully studied the various documents of the CPPCC during its opening. The soldiers did not easily let go of every little piece of news about the CPPCC in the Yangtze River Daily. During the day, everyone was divided into several groups, and one person was selected to read. Before lights out at night, everyone chatted casually. All organs and troops held grand meetings at their驻地 (zhùdì - stationed location/barracks) to warmly celebrate. At the celebration meeting of the Political Department of the Field Army, Deputy Director Tao Zhu called on everyone to step up their work and build up the armed forces well, and to celebrate the opening of the People's Political Consultative Conference with practical actions. In the field hospitals and rear hospitals, the wounded and sick were also encouraged by the news of the opening of the People's Political Consultative Conference, and they asked to be discharged from the hospital early. Every wounded comrade was excited to feel that this was the day they had been striving for after years of hard fighting, sweating and bleeding. Cui Zhongwu, the battalion commander of a certain unit who had his appendix removed and had not yet recovered, excitedly ran to the head of the medical clinic after learning that the People's Political Consultative Conference was about to be held, asking to be allowed to be discharged from the hospital immediately and return to his work post to participate in the great historical march to completely eliminate the remaining enemies.
