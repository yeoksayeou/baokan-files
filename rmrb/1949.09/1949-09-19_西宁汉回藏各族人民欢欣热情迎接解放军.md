Xinhua News Agency, Xining, September 18th: The people of all nationalities in Xining City, liberated from the shackles of the autocratic and reactionary rule of the Ma Bufang bandit gang, welcomed the People's Liberation Army with unparalleled enthusiasm. When the vanguard of the People's Liberation Army arrived in Xining on September 6, the citizens rushed out of the city to greet them. Representatives of the citizens rode in thirteen cars driven by workers of the former Northwest Minsheng Corporation's motorcade to meet them from afar. The cars were decorated with colorful flowers and slogans of various colors. When the citizen representatives on the cars saw the PLA ranks coming towards them, they quickly jumped out of the cars and welcomed the soldiers to board the cars and head towards Xining. When the motorcade carrying the PLA entered Dongguan, representatives from all walks of life of the Han, Hui, and Tibetan people had already gathered on the streets. Every time a car passed by, people immediately burst into cheers and applause. An old lady in her sixties, Mother Li, walked up with a water pot and said excitedly to the soldiers in the car: "Comrades of the People's Liberation Army, you have finally come! I am too poor to afford tea, so I put in a little bit of dried tea leaves. It doesn't taste good, but it's a token of my appreciation." As soon as the soldiers got out of the car, they were surrounded by the welcoming crowd. Many people stepped forward to shake the soldiers' hands tightly and said, "We waited today, we waited tomorrow, and finally we have you here." On the second day after liberation, the propaganda vehicle of the Cultural and Educational Department of the Xining Military Control Commission paraded through the city, carrying giant portraits of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, to conduct propaganda activities. Nearly a thousand workers, peasants, students, citizens, Hui people, and Tibetan people waiting at the gate of the puppet provincial government immediately surrounded the truck when they saw the giant portraits of the people's leaders, vying to look up. The propagandists explained the nationwide victory situation and the policy and propositions of the Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army. When they spoke about the People's Liberation Army's determination to completely eliminate the remaining bandit troops of Jiang, Hu, and Ma, liberate all of China, and arrest war criminals such as Chiang Kai-shek, Hu Zongnan, Ma Bufang, and Ma Hongkui and hand them over to the people for trial, the sound of the speech was immediately drowned out by the sudden burst of applause.

　　西宁汉回藏各族人民欢欣热情迎接解放军
    【新华社西宁十八日电】从马步芳匪帮专制反动统治桎梏下解放出来的西宁市各族人民，以无比的热忱欢迎解放军。九月六日解放军前锋部队进抵西宁时，市民争相出城迎接。市民代表们乘着原西北民生公司汽车队工人驾着的十三辆汽车远道赶来相迎。车上满饰着彩花和各色标语。车上的市民代表望见迎面开过来的解放军行列时，连忙跳下车来，欢迎战士们登车向西宁驰进。在载着解放军的汽车队进入东关时，汉、回、藏各族人民各界代表已经拥集街头。每当一辆汽车从面前开过，人们立即爆发出欢呼和掌声。一位六十多岁的李老太太，提着一个水罐子走上前来，激动地对车上的战士们说：“解放军同志们，你们可是来了！我穷的买不起茶叶，放了一点＠干茶叶子，不好喝，表点心意。”战士们一下车，就被欢迎的人群包围起来。许多人上前去紧紧地握着战士们的手说：“今天盼，明天盼，终归把你们盼来了。”解放后的第二天，西宁市军管会文教处的宣传卡车载着毛主席、朱总司令的巨像，巡行市区，进行宣传活动。在伪省政府大门口等候的近千工人、农民、学生、市民、回民、藏民群众，一看见人民领袖的巨像，立刻团团围住卡车，争相仰望。宣传员们讲解全国胜利形势和共产党、解放军的政策主张。当讲到解放军一定要彻底消灭蒋胡马残余匪军，解放全中国，并逮捕蒋介石、胡宗南、马步芳、马鸿逵等战争罪犯交给人民审判时，讲话的声音马上被骤起的掌声所淹没。
