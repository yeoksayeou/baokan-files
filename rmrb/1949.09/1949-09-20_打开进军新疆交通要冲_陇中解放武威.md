Xinhua News Agency, Northwest Front, 19th: The People's Liberation Army, continuing its advance into central Gansu, has made rapid progress. On the afternoon of the 16th, it liberated Wuwei County, a vital transportation hub west of Lanzhou leading to Xinjiang. Over 700 men of the Nationalist remnant Huang Zuxiong's 91st Army directly subordinate cavalry regiment, along with approximately 1,000 men from the 246th Division's cavalry regiment, surrendered to our army. In the battle, the People's Liberation Army also annihilated a part of the 4th company of the 173rd Division's cavalry regiment, belonging to the bandit Zhou Jiabin.

Xinhua News Agency, Northwest Front, 18th: In the ten days since its liberation, the Lanzhou Military Control Commission and Garrison Headquarters have accommodated and registered over 3,500 scattered soldiers, stragglers, and Nationalist personnel, and seized a significant amount of weapons and military supplies. The Garrison Headquarters and Liaison Office registered 2,752 scattered soldiers, the Aviation Group registered 172 Nationalist aviation personnel, and the Public Security Bureau registered over 400 Nationalist police officers. Additionally, there were registrations at the military district headquarters, factories, and schools. Among them were four major generals, one commissioner, and three field grade officers. Among the scattered soldiers and stragglers who voluntarily surrendered and registered, some turned over important military maps, some wrote letters of persuasion to officers still in the Nationalist bandit army, and some reported hidden Nationalist armed personnel and buried supplies. The seized weapons included over 600 rifles, over 100 light and heavy machine guns, over 350,000 rounds of ammunition, as well as radio transmitters, telephones, artillery shells, automobiles, and electrical wires. The Nationalist armed personnel who have been accommodated and registered are, with the exception of those injured who have been sent to hospitals for treatment, largely undergoing centralized education. After education, those who wish to return home will be prepared for repatriation.
