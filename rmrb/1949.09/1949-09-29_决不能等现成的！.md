"Absolutely Cannot Wait for Ready-Made Things!"
    Preface
    On the second evening of the People's Political Consultative Conference, at seven o'clock, our agency's service staff study group began studying.
    "I am especially happy today!" Little Liang shook his head, tossing the lock of hair he didn't often groom.
    "Why?" I put down my textbook, not planning to lecture them just yet, and stared at his smiling, wide-open mouth.
    "Ha! The new China has been proclaimed, how can I not be happy? I think everyone is very happy." Little Liang, with his Northeastern accent, had shining eyes.
    "I think I'm the happiest!" Old Yu took over, his voice somewhat slow and deep:
    "For decades, under the hands of the Kuomintang reactionaries, let alone being allowed to express your opinion, you didn't even dare breathe loudly every day. Earning a few big coins a month, not enough to eat, not enough to wear, the kids crying and the wife yelling all day long, alas! At that time, we were simply not human, and people didn't treat us like human beings." Old Yu sighed as he recalled the pain of the past.
    "The past—" Old Yu continued: "In the past, my eldest brother was conscripted into the army by the Kuomintang, and ended up losing his life for nothing; my second brother was captured by the Japanese devils to be a forced laborer, and as a result, died of illness. I—I also jumped into the river..." Old Yu's face turned gray.
    Old Yu is over fifty years old this year, from eastern Hebei. He had studied in a private school for two years as a child. In the past, he had always worked as a servant for others. After participating in the revolution last year and coming here to work as a service staff member, he progressed very quickly. He understood that the reason why most people didn't have enough to eat in the past was because of the existence of the feudal and bureaucratic bourgeoisie. Today, he understands that the Communist Party is serving the people, he understands that the people should stand up, and he knows that today the working people are the masters, so he has begun to become active, and he always buries himself in books when he has time.
    "Now that the new China has been established, I must study hard and serve the people well to fulfill my responsibility," Huang Su said.
    "Today, the People's Political Consultative Conference has opened, and our great new China is born. This is worthy of our celebration. Chairman Mao said: The Chinese people have stood up; then, we must all be better people! Be a glorious Chinese!" I laughed with them.
    "Build our China like the Soviet Union," Old Yu said, "so that every working person can live happily and joyfully."
    Huang Su said: "That depends on how hard we work. If everyone works hard, China can be built up quickly; otherwise, if we just wait for ready-made things, it will be slow."
    "Yes, we cannot wait for ready-made things!" Old Yu said loudly.
    "Of course, we cannot wait for ready-made things!" Everyone became excited and encouraged.

　　“决不能等现成的！”
    也序
    人民政协开会的第二天晚上七点钟，我们机关的勤务员学习小组开始学习了。
    “我今天特别高兴！”小梁脑袋一幌，抖了一下他那撮不常整理的头发。
    “为什么？”我放下了课本，先不打算给他们讲课，注视着他那笑着张大了的嘴。
    “哈！新中国宣告成立了，怎不高兴？我看大伙也都是很高兴的。”小梁耍着东北腔，眼睛在发光。
    “我想我是最高兴的！”老于接过话来，声音有些缓慢而低沉：
    “数十年来，在国民党反动派的手底下，别说是许可你发表意见，每天就是连大气都不敢出。一个月赚那几个大钱，吃不饱，穿不暖，成天价弄得孩子哭老婆叫的，唉！那时候咱们简直就不是人，人家也没拿咱当人待。”老于一面叹着气，一面在回忆着过去的痛苦。
    “过去——”老于接过话来：“过去，我大兄弟被国民党抓兵抓了去，结果白送了命；二兄弟让日本鬼子抓去当苦工，结果，病死了。我——我也曾跳过河……”老于的脸色灰黯起来。
    老于今年五十多岁了，冀东人，小时候也念过二年私塾。过去，一直就给人家当差役，从去年参加革命到这里来作勤务员后，进步的很快，他懂得了过去大多数人所以没有饭吃的原因，是因为有封建及官僚资产阶级的存在。今天他了解了共产党是为人民服务的，他了解了人民是应该翻身的，他知道今天劳动人民是主人了，所以，他开始积极起来，一有时间他总是埋头看书。
    “这回新中国成立了，我一定要努力学习，好好为人民服务才算尽到责任。”黄素说。
    “今天，人民政协开幕了，我们这个伟大的新中国诞生了，这是值得我们庆贺的。毛主席说：中国人民已经站起来了；那么，我们都要更好作人呵！作一个光荣的中国人。”我也同他们一起笑着。
    “把我们中国建设得象苏联那样，”老于说，“每个劳动人民都生活得很愉快、很幸福。”
    黄素说：“那就需要看我们的努力怎样，如果大家全好好工作，就能把中国很快地建设起来；若不然，只等现成的那就慢了。”
    “是的，我们不能等现成的！”老于高声地说。
    “当然，我们不能等现成的！”大伙都兴奋鼓舞起来。
