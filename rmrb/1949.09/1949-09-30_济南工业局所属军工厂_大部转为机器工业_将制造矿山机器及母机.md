(Jinan News) In order to implement the instructions of the East China Bureau on streamlining, economizing, and developing production, and to restore and develop the people's economic construction, the Jinan Industrial Bureau, in accordance with the decisions of the provincial industrial and mining department's conference on military, mining, and other heavy industrial enterprises, has gradually shifted most of its seven factories from military production to peaceful industrial production. The remainder will move towards regular national defense ordnance production. The steps and plans are roughly as follows:

I. Except for the artillery repair section of Factory No. 2 and Factory No. 5, which will continue military production, the remaining factories will gradually end military production and switch to peaceful industrial production. It is decided that Factory No. 1 will first manufacture mining machinery, water pipes, etc., and take time to research and improve the manufacture of diesel engines, agricultural implements, etc.; Factory No. 2 and Factory No. 6 will merge to manufacture mining machinery such as water pumps, blowers, electric winches, etc.; Factory No. 3 will continue to manufacture detonators, fuses, explosives, etc., for use in mine reconstruction; Factory No. 4 will continue to manufacture precision machine tools to improve quality and serve as the first experimental factory to implement enterprise management.

II. All factories will universally launch worker education and vigorously prepare for future production work. The content of the education is divided into five types: trade union education, situation education, class education, job transition education, and cultural education, which will be carried out sequentially.

III. While conducting education, the registration of machinery, tools, property, and funds in each factory will be carried out to calculate costs and capital when enterprise management is implemented.

IV. Through democratic discussions and approved by the Industrial Bureau, the organizational structure will be reorganized, accounting institutions will be established, and efforts will be made to calculate costs, formulate systems, labor discipline, and precise scientific management methods in the future, and a production competition movement will be launched.

V. After clearing assets and adjusting the organization, the Industrial Bureau intends to allocate specific funds, machinery, materials, and production tasks to each factory within a certain period, based on the specific circumstances of each factory.

Regarding the production plan and sales issues, the bureau has sent a working group to Zibo for investigation. Currently, the first step is to produce 150 water pumps below 300 horsepower, 100 electric winches, 80 blowers, as well as water pipes, air winches, crushers, and dozens of machine tools such as repairing lathes and planers for various mines in Zibo; the second step is to replace the self-used machine tools of each factory with new ones, further improve product quality and efficiency, and use the surplus older tools to jointly establish several machine repair stations with cooperatives to assist in developing a province-wide machine repair cooperative movement, and continue to manufacture diesel engines and agricultural tools in large quantities for various state-owned factories.

　　济南工业局所属军工厂
  　大部转为机器工业
  　将制造矿山机器及母机
    【济南讯】济南工业局为贯彻华东局整编节约发展生产的指示，恢复与发展人民的经济建设，按照省工矿部召开的全省军工，矿山及其他重工业企业生产会议的决定，业已将所属七个厂大部分别逐步由军工生产转入和平工业生产：其余则步入正规国防兵工生产。其步骤、计划大要如下：一、除二厂修炮部及五厂仍继续兵工生产外，其余各厂均逐渐结束军工生产，转入和平工业生产。计决定一厂先行制造矿山机械、水管等，并抽暇研究改良制造柴油引擎、农业器具等；二厂与六厂合并制造矿山机器，如水泵、鼓风机、电绞车等；三厂继续制造雷管、导火索、炸药等，以作改造开矿应用；四厂则仍行制造精密母机提高质量，并作为首先实行企业化的实验厂。二、各厂普遍展开工人教育，并大力准备今后生产工作。教育的内容共分工会教育、形势教育、阶级教育、转业教育、文化教育五种，先后分别进行。三、与进行教育同时，进行各厂机器、工具、财产、资金等登记，以便在实行企业化时计算成本和资金。四、通过民主讨论，经工业局核准，实行整理组织机构，建立会计机构，求得将来能计算成本、制定制度、劳动纪律、精密科学管理方法等，并展开生产竞赛运动。五、清理资财、调整机构之后，工业局拟依照各厂具体情况，分别予各厂在一定期间内的一定资金、机器、材料和生产任务。
    关于生产计划及销路问题，该局已派工作小组至淄博调查，目前第一步拟代淄博各矿场作三百匹马力以下的水泵一百五十个、电绞车一百个、鼓风机八十个及水管、气绞车、粉碎机、修理车床刨床等工作母机数十部；第二步拟将各厂自用工作母机换成新的，进一步提高产品质量，提高效率，并以多余的较旧工具与合作社合办机器修理站数处，协助开展全省机器修理合作运动，并继续代各个国营工厂大量制造机器制造柴油机引擎和农具。
