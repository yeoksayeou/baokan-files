Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 15th. The Preparatory Committee of the First National Congress of Natural Science Workers of China held an enlarged meeting of its Standing Committee on the 11th, resolving to send a telegram to the British Association for the Advancement of Science protesting its reactionary act of expelling the renowned British physicist Professor Bernal from its membership, and to send a telegram of sympathy to Professor Bernal. The texts of the two telegrams are as follows:
  　(1) Telegram to the British Association for the Advancement of Science:

British Association for the Advancement of Science:

Professor Bernal criticized the warmongering tendencies of British and American scientific research at the All-Soviet Union Conference for Peace. Instead of deeply reflecting on your own actions that violate the will of the people, you have unreasonably expelled him from your membership. We are extremely indignant at your despicable actions of kowtowing to the dictates of international warmongers and persecuting progressive individuals. We hereby send a telegram of protest, hoping that you will immediately cease such measures to avoid further opposition from peace-loving people around the world.

The Preparatory Committee of the First National Congress of Natural Science Workers of China
　　(2) Telegram of Condolence to Professor Bernal:

Professor Bernal:

Because you criticized the warmongering tendencies of British and American scientific research at the All-Soviet Union Conference for Peace, you have suffered shameful persecution by the British Association for the Advancement of Science, which expelled you from its membership. Upon learning of this, we are extremely indignant at the actions of the responsible persons of that association in kowtowing to the dictates of warmongers, and we express our serious protest. We will certainly learn from your spirit of upholding peace and unremitting struggle, and we will work to enhance world peace. Please continue to lead the British people's scientific workers in fighting to the end together.

The Preparatory Committee of the First National Congress of Natural Science Workers of China

  　（一）给英国科学促进会的电报英国科学促进会：
    贝尔纳教授在全苏拥护和平大会上批评了英美科学研究工作的好战倾向。你们不深自反省你们自己违反人民意志的行为，反而无理的开除他的会籍。我们对于你们这种仰承国际战争贩子的鼻息，迫害进步人士的卑劣举动，极为愤慨，特电抗议，并望立即停止此种措施，以免续遭世界爱好和平人民的反对。
