Shijiazhuang Dispatch: Cotton fields in the suburbs of Shijiazhuang are currently being harvested, and it is estimated that over 80% of a good harvest year is expected. This year, cotton seedlings are growing more vigorously than they have in the past three or four years. Each mu can yield 150 to 250 jin of seed cotton, with the highest yield reaching 300 jin. Even cotton fields severely affected by aphids can yield over 100 jin. Pang Zhuke of Taoyuan Village in the Fifth District owns 28 mu of land and planted 15 mu of cotton this year, and plans to plant more next year. Cao Wanzhen of Sanzhuang in the Sixth District said, "I think planting cotton is more worthwhile than anything else. Listening to the government is the right thing to do." To maintain superior varieties, farmers in various districts are actively conducting field selection of seeds.
