North China Highway Transportation General Bureau
Manager Accounting Conference Concludes
Deputy Director Feng Yujiu Delivers Concluding Report

[This newspaper] The Manager Accounting Conference of subordinate units convened by the North China Highway Transportation General Bureau concluded on the afternoon of the 26th. A total of 95 representatives and attendees were present. Deputy Director Feng Yujiu delivered a concluding report, which mainly pointed out:

I. In terms of working relationships: First, the entire state-owned enterprise should be seen as a whole, and transportation is a part of the whole. In the past, there was a considerable degree of independence, and the relationship with other departments was not good enough. For example, the trade and industry departments would rather find others to transport goods than find the transportation company. In the future, efforts should be made to sign long-term contracts with state-owned enterprises, that is, the transportation of state-owned enterprises should first be given to state-owned transportation departments, and the transportation departments should consider it as a due task. Second, the cooperative business between urban and rural areas should be assisted in its development. Third, private transportation and mass transportation should also be assisted in their development. In North China, the role of mass transportation is still very large. They have a total of 30,000 horse-drawn carts, while we only have 992. Therefore, we must help them well. Fourth, railway transportation should be the main focus, and highway transportation should be supplementary, developing in directions that railways cannot reach, or connecting places that railways have not yet reached in the same direction with highway transportation, implementing railway-highway combined transportation, and helping trains organize more freight. Connect large, medium and small cities in North China with cars and horse-drawn carts. Fifth, internally, everything should rely on workers, and democratic management should be considered as a revolutionary method and direction for leading and developing enterprises. Sixth, the issue of making money. On the basis of today's breaking the old, accumulating capital, and expanding reproduction, making money has become an urgent task. However, this is fundamentally different from the methods and purposes of making money in the past and in private transportation. We should not hold a purely financial point of view, but should combine financial tasks with economic tasks. We should look at how much wealth has been added to the entire economy from promoting production and exchanging more materials.

II. In terms of work plans: (1) Automobile transportation should resolutely implement the modification of charcoal cars, coal cars, and firewood cars. In particular, the companies in Beijing, Tianjin, Taiyuan, Zhangjiakou, and Xinxiang should implement this more thoroughly. (2) Horse-drawn cart transportation should also be developed, and efforts should be made to increase 400 carts by the end of this year. (3) The transshipment business should be well developed, because this is the hub of the transportation business and is necessary to connect mass transportation. The summary reported the specific work plans of each company for the past six months. Deputy Director Feng pointed out: We should first grasp the materials, discuss them from top to bottom, and let the staff understand and grasp this plan so that they can complete it with confidence. In addition, we should also summarize and inspect and hold competitions.

After reporting on various issues in the work system, Deputy Director Feng called on everyone to work hard to learn from the Soviet Union's transportation industry and its spirit of working without fear of difficulties.

　　华北公路运输总局
  　经理会计会议闭幕
  　冯于九副局长作总结报告
    【本报讯】华北公路运输总局召开的所属各单位经理会计会议已于二十六日下午闭幕。到会的代表及列席者共九十五人。由冯于九副局长作总结报告，总结中主要指出：
    一、在工作关系方面：首先对整个国营企业应看成是一个整体，而运输是整体的一部分。过去曾存在相当程度的闹独立性，与其他部门关系不够好，如使贸易工商部门宁可找别人运货，不找运输公司。今后应努力与国营企业订立长期合同，即国营企业的运输首先应给国营的运输部门，而运输部门应该认为是应有的任务。其次对城乡合作事业，应协助其发展。第三、对私人运输和群众运输亦应协助其发展，在华北，群众运输的作用还很大，他们共有三万辆马车，而我们只九百九十二辆。因此要好好帮助他们。第四、对铁路运输应以铁路为主，公路为辅，向铁路所不能达到的方向发展，或在同一方向把铁路未通的地方，用公路运输连接起来，实行铁路公路联运，帮助火车组织更多的货运。把华北大中小城市用汽车、马车都连接起来。第五、在内部要一切依靠工人，应认为民主管理是领导和发展企业的革命方法和方向。第六、赚钱问题，在今日破旧的基础上，积累资本，扩大再生产，赚钱已成为迫切的任务，但这根本和以往及私人运输赚钱的方法目的不同，不应该抱着单纯的财政观点，而应把财政任务与经济任务结合起来。要从促进生产，交流更多物资，整个经济上增加了多少财富来看。
    二、在工作计划方面：（一）汽车运输应坚决实行改装木炭车、石炭车、劈柴车。特别是北京、天津、太原、张家口、新乡几个公司更应贯彻。（二）马车运输还应发展，今年年底要争取增加四百辆。（三）转运事业应很好发展，因为这是运输事业的枢纽，联系群众运输所必需的。总结中报告了各公司半年中的具体工作计划，冯副局长指出：应首先掌握材料，自上而下的讨论，让职工了解掌握这个计划，才能使他们有信心的去完成。此外还应该总结检查及举行竞赛。
    冯副局长在报告了工作制度中的各项问题后，号召大家努力学习苏联的运输事业及其不怕困难的工作精神。
