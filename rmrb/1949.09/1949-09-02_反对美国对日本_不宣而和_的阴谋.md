　　Oppose the American Conspiracy of "Undeclared Peace" with Japan
    A US government spokesman openly stated that the United States is implementing a so-called "undeclared peace" plan with Japan, allowing Japan, which has not yet signed a peace treaty and is still in a state of war, to participate in international conferences, exchange consulates with other countries, and engage in other bilateral activities. This once again exposes the utterly reactionary imperialist nature of the American policy towards Japan. This indicates that US imperialism is determined to use this "undeclared peace" plan to replace a peace treaty with Japan, to delay or even abandon a peace treaty altogether, and to occupy Japan for a long time in order to rapidly transform Japan into the main base for the United States to carry out aggression in the Far East. The Chinese people, the Japanese people, and the people of other nations in Asia must unite and smash this sinister plan of US imperialism.
    A series of facts at present prove that the conspiracy of US imperialism to use Japanese reactionary forces to oppose the Eastern people, especially the new China, is being intensified. Japanese newspaper reports indicate that the United States has designated Japan to participate in the "Pacific Alliance" instigated by the United States, and the Yoshida reactionary government is actively preparing to participate in this alliance. US Undersecretary of the Army Voorhees is visiting Japan while the US State Department is drafting a "bipartisan" policy toward China and the Far East. United Press openly stated that one of Voorhees' tasks is to discuss with MacArthur the establishment of a so-called "security zone" around China. Now, the United States is openly allowing Japan to unite with the reactionaries of Southeast Asian countries through "bilateral activities" in order to establish a reactionary front, organize a Far Eastern anti-communist and anti-people crusade, surround and attack the people's democratic new China from the outside, and suppress the national independence and people's revolution movements in Eastern countries (including Japan). At the same time, with the support of MacArthur, the Supreme Commander of the US occupation forces in Japan, the Kuomintang is recruiting Japanese soldiers in Japan to come to China and continue to act as executioners to slaughter the Chinese people.
    One point that must be emphasized to the Japanese people is that this "undeclared peace" conspiracy plan that the United States has already implemented not only completely violates the principles of the Potsdam Proclamation and other international agreements, seriously infringes upon the interests of the people of the Soviet Union, China, and other countries that fought against Japan, but also harms the interests of the Japanese people. Because when US imperialism implements this conspiracy, it will inevitably further support the reactionary forces and militarism of Japan, and strengthen its attack on the Japanese people, making it impossible for Japan to become a democratic Japan. Therefore, the Japanese people must unite with the Chinese people and the people of all other Eastern countries to resolutely oppose US imperialism's attempt to control Japan with Japan as a base, turn Japan into a colony and a base of aggression, and implement a counter-revolutionary plan to antagonize the Eastern people. The Chinese people should draw the necessary lessons from this new American conspiracy: Although the American policy of intervention in China has suffered a shameful defeat, they will never give up, and they will continue to make trouble to the end. Therefore, the Chinese people must and can only oppose the new conspiracies of imperialism with the determination to fight to the end. As long as the Chinese people and the people of Eastern countries unite as one and persist in their struggle, as long as the Chinese people resolutely resist US imperialism, and as long as the Japanese people and the Eastern people and the Chinese people jointly resist, any aggressive conspiracy of US imperialism can only have one result—failure.

### 反对美国对日本“不宣而和”的阴谋

　　反对美国对日本“不宣而和”的阴谋
    美政府发言人公开表示，美国正对日本实行所谓“不宣而和”的计划，允许尚未签订和约因而仍处在交战状态的日本参加国际会议，与别国交换领事馆，并从事其他双边活动。这再次暴露了美国对日政策反动透顶的帝国主义真面貌。这表示美帝国主义已决心利用这个“不宣而和”的计划，来代替对日和约，拖延以至根本抛弃对日和约，长期独占日本，以便迅速地把日本变为美国在远东实行侵略的主要基地。中国人民和日本人民和亚洲其他各民族人民，必须团结一致，击破美帝国主义的这个凶恶的计划。
    目前一连串的事实证明：美帝国主义利用日本反动势力反对东方人民，特别是反对新中国的阴谋，正在加紧进行中。日本报纸消息指出：美国已规定日本参加美国策动的“太平洋联盟”，吉田反动政府正在积极作参加这个联盟的准备工作。美陆次伍利斯正在美国务院拟定对中国及远东“两党一致”的政策的时候，访问日本。合众社公开表示：伍利斯此行任务之一，是为了与麦克阿瑟商谈在中国四周建立所谓“安全区”。现在，美国索性公开允许日本通过“双边活动”而和东南亚各国的反动派联合起来，以便建立一条反动阵线，组织远东反共反人民的十字军，从外部来包围和进攻人民民主的新中国，并镇压东方各国（包括日本）的民族独立和人民革命运动。与此同时，在美国驻日占领军统帅麦克阿瑟的赞助下，国民党正在日本招募日本兵来华，继续充当屠杀中国人民的刽子手。
    有一点是必须着重告诉日本人民的：美国这种已经实行的“不宣而和”的阴谋计划，不但完全违反波茨坦公告等国际协定的原则，严重地侵犯苏联、中国以及其他对日作战国家的人民的利益，而且同样侵害了日本人民的利益。因为美帝国主义在实行这个阴谋的时候，必然要更进一步地扶助日本的反动势力和军国主义，而加强对于日本人民的进攻，使日本不能成为民主的日本。因此，日本人民必须和中国人民以及其他一切东方国家的人民联合起来，坚决反对美帝国主义企图以日本为基地而控制日本，变日本为殖民地和侵略基地，以与东方人民为敌的反革命计划。中国人民更应从美国这个新阴谋中吸取必要的教训：美国对中国的干涉政策虽已遭到可耻的失败，但他们是决不会死心的，他们是要继续捣乱到底的。因此，中国人民必须而且只有以斗争到底的决心，来反对帝国主义的新阴谋。只要中国人民和东方各国人民团结一致，坚持不懈地斗争，只要中国人民对于美帝国主义实行坚决的反抗，只要日本人民和东方人民和中国人民共同反抗，美帝国主义的任何侵略阴谋，就只能有一个结果——失败。
