Thoughts on the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference
Professor of History Department, Yenching University, Weng Dujian

We should have a basic understanding of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, that is, the People's Political Consultative Conference is different from the old Political Consultative Conference three years ago in essence, composition, and task. This Political Consultative Conference truly represents the wishes of the people of the whole country, and is a concrete realization of the unprecedented great unity of the people of the whole country. From then on, our enemies, imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, will no longer be able to cause trouble. From then on, the Chinese people will truly be their own masters! Let each of us celebrate the victory and success of this meeting with great enthusiasm!

　　对人民政协的感想
    燕大历史系教授  翁独健
    我们对于中国人民政治协商会议应该有个基本的认识，那就是人民政协与三年前的旧政协，无论在本质上成份上任务上都不相同。这一个政协真正代表了全国人民的愿望，是全国人民空前大团结的具体实现，从此以后我们的敌人帝国主义、封建主义与官僚资本主义再也无法作祟了，从此以后中国人民真正做了自己的主人啦！让我们每一个人以万分热诚来庆祝这个会议的胜利成功吧！
