　　Yanjing Paper Mill Workers Donate Millet to Help Disaster Victims
    [This City News] The Yanjing Paper Mill Trade Union, in order to relieve disaster victims in various places, launched a campaign on the 14th to save money and donate to disaster relief. By the evening of the 15th, 753 jin of millet had been donated in two days. Shi Yuzhen and Gang Jixu, members of the factory's trade union, went to various shifts the day before yesterday to explain the significance of saving money for disaster relief, described the disaster situation in various places this year and the difficult living conditions of the victims, and called on all workers to save money and donate to help farmers overcome the disaster. Workers in the iron workshop were the first to respond to this call, with nine people donating 73 jin of millet. Other workers also responded enthusiastically. Everyone recalled that when Beiping was first liberated, the factory had not yet started work, and the workers received millet, all thanks to the help of the farmers. Now that the farmers are encountering disasters, the workers should also help. At the same time, it made everyone realize that only with the mutual assistance of the working people can all difficulties be overcome. Therefore, donations became more enthusiastic. Within two days, more than 150 employees donated 753 jin of millet.

　　燕京纸厂工人捐米救助灾民
    【本市讯】燕京造纸厂工会为救济各地灾民，特于十四日发起节约捐款救灾运动，迄十五日晚，两天中已捐得小米七百五十三斤。该厂工会委员石玉珍、刚继绪等曾于前天到各班去解释节约救灾的意义，说明今年各地灾情与灾民生活的困难情形，号召全体工人节约捐款，帮助农民渡过灾荒。铁工班工人首先响应这个号召，九个人捐了七十三斤小米。其他工人，也纷纷响应。大家回想起北平刚解放时，工厂还没有开工，工人就领到了小米，那都是农民帮的忙，现在农民遇见灾荒，工人也应该帮忙。同时使大家觉悟到只有在劳动人民的互相帮助下才能克服一切困难。因之捐款更加踊跃，两天内，全体职工一百五十多人，就捐出了小米七百五十三斤。
