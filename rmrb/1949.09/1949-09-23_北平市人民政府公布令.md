After approval, in addition to directly delivering the approval, the qualified medical personnel will be announced in batches in the newspaper.

　　3. The license fee of millet is calculated according to the wholesale price announced in the People's Daily on the day before the payment, and shall be paid upon approval of the license.

　　4. Pharmacists and pharmacy assistants who serve in pharmacies established by others shall temporarily apply for registration in accordance with the measures for medical personnel to apply for registration before the measures for issuing professional certificates are promulgated. After passing the review, a temporary business approval will be granted, and this approval will be used to exchange for a professional certificate in the future.
