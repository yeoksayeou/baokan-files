　　Review and Overcome Biases in Trade Union Work
    The Shandong Provincial Trade Union Work Conference, based on the spirit of the National Trade Union Work Conference's resolution, focused on reviewing the tendencies of closed-doorism and bureaucracy in trade union work and clearly recognized the various basic issues related to trade union work. This conference was successful. The tendencies of closed-doorism and bureaucracy in the labor movement exist just as seriously in other liberated areas across the country. Therefore, the review by the Shandong Provincial Trade Union Work Conference has important significance for implementing the National Trade Union Work Resolution nationwide.
    The basic source of the long-standing tendencies of closed-doorism and bureaucracy in trade union work mainly stems from the failure to clearly establish the idea of relying on the working class, the failure to understand that the working class is an advanced class and, in a people's democratic country, a leading class. In state-owned enterprises and cooperative-run enterprises, because the owners of the enterprises are the liberated people organized into the regime and cooperatives, the interests of the workers in these enterprises are completely aligned with the administrative aspects of managing the enterprises; they are the masters of the enterprises. In private enterprises, although workers are in an exploited (labor) position, they still hold a leading position socially and politically. They do not understand the working class's current social and political status, and therefore, they do not understand why we must primarily and mainly rely on the strength of the working class in leading and restoring production, in leading the management and construction of cities, and in leading the people of the city to fight against imperialists, Kuomintang reactionaries, and bureaucratic capitalists. Of course, to rely on the working class (not just a few advanced elements), it is necessary to organize the working masses, raise the class consciousness of the workers, and make the working masses act as a conscious class, so that the trade union truly becomes a mass organization of the working class. Only in this way can the working class, under the leadership of its vanguard—the Communist Party—become a truly leading class.
    Currently, trade union work in many places quite universally exhibits biases: First, and most importantly, is the bias of confusing the Party organization with the workers' organization, using the standards of Communist Party members to measure the broad working masses, setting the conditions for workers to join the trade union too high, and making the trade union a organization of a few advanced elements. Many trade union leaders, on the pretext that workers in private factories are "backward," on the pretext that workers are "complex," and on the pretext of political issues (that is, confusing their class brothers with the very few secret agents in the factories), exclude the broad masses of middle and backward workers from the trade union, causing the trade union to lose its class mass character; instead of organizing one hundred percent of the workers, they organize ten percent, or even one percent, resulting in a few people dancing naked, weak and powerless. Under such circumstances, it is of course impossible to exert the leadership role of the working class. Second, there are also many places where workers are organized one hundred percent on the surface, but due to administrative orders, substitution, and formalistic work styles, the working masses have not been fully mobilized in practice. The trade union lacks internal democratic life, and the payment of membership dues, meetings, and cultural entertainment have all become a set of formulas. In this way, it is impossible to "make every non-Party worker and staff member feel that the trade union is an organization close to them, elected by them, supervised by them, and reporting to them." "Every member is a conscious and active participant in the collective life of the trade union." In this way, it is impossible to make the trade union a school for educating workers. On the contrary, in many places, the trade union can only be a place where some people are appointed from top to bottom, and cannot more solemnly and systematically conduct elections; internal problems of the trade union often easily become decisions made by a few people without fully democratic discussions, which inevitably makes trade union work appear to be just a few cadres detached from production issuing orders, rather than fully demonstrating that it is "everyone running the trade union." This formalism and bureaucracy suppresses the political enthusiasm of the working class, which is extremely harmful and dangerous.
    According to the resolution of the National Trade Union Work Conference, the central task of the current national trade union work is to basically organize the national working class, especially industrial workers, in about a year. Only by being organized can we victoriously shoulder the tasks that the working class should bear in the construction of the new democratic regime and economic construction. In order to organize, it is necessary to study the spirit of the Shandong Provincial Trade Union Work Conference, boldly and deeply criticize the existing biases or errors in trade union work, find the root causes, and immediately overcome them. Only in this way can we better implement the spirit of the National Trade Union Work Conference in practice, so that the great task of basically organizing the national working class in about a year can be realized!

### 检讨并克服工会工作中的偏向

　　检讨并克服工会工作中的偏向
    山东全省工会工作会议，根据全国工会工作会议决议的精神，着重地检讨了工会工作中的关门主义和官僚主义的倾向，明确地认识了有关工会工作的各种基本问题，这个会议是成功的。工人运动中的关门主义和官僚主义的倾向，在全国其他各解放区同样严重地存在着，因此，山东省工会工作会议的检讨，对于在全国范围内贯彻全国工会工作决议便有其重要意义。
    工会工作中长期存在着的关门主义和官僚主义的倾向，其基本来源主要是由于没有明确地建立依靠工人阶级的思想，不了解工人阶级是先进的阶级，在人民民主的国家，他是领导的阶级，在公营企业与合作社经营的企业中，由于企业的主人是解放了的人民组织起来的政权与合作社，因而在这些企业中的工人，和管理企业的行政方面利益完全一致，他们就是企业的主人，在私营企业中，工人一方面虽居于被剥削的（劳方）地位，但同时在社会上和政治上，仍然居于领导的地位。他们不了解工人阶级今天的社会政治地位，因而也就不懂得为什么我们在领导与恢复生产中，在领导管理与建设城市中，在领导城市人民向帝国主义者、国民党反动派及官僚资产阶级进行斗争中必须首先而且主要地依靠工人阶级的力量。当然，要依靠工人阶级（不仅仅是少数先进分子），就必须组织工人群众，提高工人的阶级觉悟，使工人群众作为一个觉悟了的阶级面行动起来，使工会真正成为工人阶级，具有广大群众性的组织。也只有如此，工人阶级在其先锋队——共产党的率领下，才能够成为名符其实的领导阶级。
    目前许多地方的工会工作相当普遍地存在着偏向：第一，也是主要的偏向，是把党的组织与工人组织混淆起来，用共产党员的标准去衡量广大工人群众，对工人加入工会的条件订得太高，工会的组织成了少数先进分子的组织，不少工会领导者借口私营工厂工人“落后”，借口工人“复杂”，以及政治问题（即把自己的阶级兄弟与工厂中极少数的特务分子混淆起来），而排斥广大的中间的以及落后的工人于工会大门之外，使工会丧失了阶级的群众性；不是组织工人的百分之百，而是组织百分之十，甚至是百分之一，结果形成少数人裸体跳舞，软弱无力，在这样情形下，当然也便不可能发挥工人阶级的领导作用。第二、也有许多地方在表面上是百分之百地把工人组织起来了，但由于行政命令包办代替及形式主义的作风，实际上工人群众并没有被充分发动起来，工会缺乏内部的民主生活，缴纳会费，开会和文化娱乐等都成了一套公式，这样就不可能“使每一个非党的工人与职员都认为工会是他们亲近的组织，是他们选出的，由他们所监督的，并向他们作汇报的”。“每一个成员都是工会的集体生活自觉而积极的参加者”，这样就不可能使工会成为教育工人的学校。相反的，很多地方的工会就只能是自上而下地委派一些人，而不能更郑重地有步骤地进行选举；工会内部问题就常常容易形成少数人作决定而不能充分进行民主的讨论，这样就不免会使工会工作表现为只是少数脱离生产的干部在发号施令，而不能充分表现出来是“大家办工会”。这种形式主义与官僚主义，压抑了工人阶级政治的积极性，是极端有害的和危险的。
    根据全国工会工作会议的决议，当前全国工会工作的中心任务，就是要在一年左右基本上把全国工人阶级首先是产业工人组织起来。只有组织起来，才能胜利地担负起工人阶级在新民主主义的政权建设与经济建设中所应负的任务。为了组织，就必须学习山东省工会工作会议的精神，大胆地深入地批判工会工作中现存的偏向或错误，找出根源，并立即予以克服。这样才能更好地贯彻全国工会工作会议的精神到实践中去，使一年左右基本上组织全国工人阶级的伟大任务能够实现！
