[This City News] Private Xin Fu, Guo Hua, and other machinery factories in Beijing sent personnel to Zhuolu to promote threshing machines and rice milling machines, achieving great success. They are now vigorously expanding production to supply agricultural tools to the countryside. Wang Yao Yu and Liu Chun Sheng, responsible persons from these two factories, recently represented seven factories, bringing two human-powered threshing machine samples to Zhuolu. They received a warm welcome from the county government and farmers. Wang and Liu also went to the central rice-producing area of the county (Taishangfu) and held meetings with district chiefs and village cadres, explaining the usage methods and performance of the threshing machine. With a threshing machine, each person can thresh twelve or thirteen *shi* of rice per day; if using manual threshing, each person can only thresh about one *shi* per day. In the past, the county consistently used animal power to press the rice, but this had to wait until after the ground froze (ninth month of the lunar calendar), which was far inferior to using a threshing machine. At the same time, using animal power to press the rice resulted in the rice stalks being completely crushed, which was a great pity; if using a threshing machine, the rice stalks remain intact and undamaged, and can be used to make straw bags (making straw bags can also solve the packaging problem for rice exports), straw ropes, straw mats, and straw cushions, etc., to develop rural sideline occupations. Therefore, adopting threshing machines can increase production efficiency and save labor. Farmers have now preliminarily established the belief in using machines. Regarding rice milling, the county government has consulted with representatives Wang and Liu and decided that the factories in this city that produce rice milling machines should organize themselves to open rice milling factories in the county, to improve rice milling technology and output. The county originally used animal power for milling, and one person could only mill a little more than one *shi* per day, with one-third of it being crushed. With electric rice milling machines, each person can mill eight *shi* per hour, avoiding broken rice and improving output and quality. The county has approximately 300 *qing* of paddy fields. The rice has not yet matured, and the farmers are currently calculating the number of threshing machines to be ordered in the first batch. According to government estimates, at least 100 units will be ordered at present. The exact number will be communicated to the factories in one or two days to proceed with ordering. After Wang and Liu returned from Zhuolu, factory owners have further and deeply understood that facing the countryside is the bright road to developing machine production. After preliminary research by the factories, five factories have decided to mass-produce threshing machines, three factories have decided to rush to produce straw cutters and balers, and three factories have decided to jointly open rice milling factories in the county. Xin Fu factory has also decided to absorb idle funds to expand production.

　　北京打稻机碾米机
  　涿鹿农民乐用
  　将至少订购一百台
    【本市讯】私营信孚、国华等机器工厂，派员到涿鹿推销打稻机、碾米机，收获极丰，正大力扩展生产，为乡村供应农具。该两厂负责人王姚玉、刘春生日前代表七家工厂携带两台人力打稻机样品赴涿鹿，受到该县县府及农民热烈欢迎；王、刘二人并到该县产稻的中心区（太上府）与区长、村干开会，说明打稻机的使用方法及性能。用打稻机每人每天可打十二、三石稻子；如用人力摔，每人每天只能打一石左右。该县过去一贯用畜力压，但是必须等到上冻（阴历九月）后才能压，远不如用打稻机打。同时用畜力压，稻秸全被压碎，非常可惜；如用打稻机则稻秸完整无损，可用作打草袋（打草袋还能够解决大米出口的包装问题）、草绳、草褥和草垫等，来发展农村副业。故采用打稻机，可以增加生产效率，节省劳动力。农民现在已初步建立了使用机器的信念。关于碾米，该县县府已与王、刘二代表商定，由本市生产碾米机的工厂组织起来到该县去开设加工碾米厂，提高碾米技术和产量。该县原用畜力碾，一天一人只能碾一石多，还要有三分之一被碾碎，用电力碾米机每人每小时可碾八石，能避免碎米，提高产量、品质。该县稻田约有三百顷，现稻子尚未成熟，农民正在统计首批需要订购打稻机数目，据政府估计，目前至少要订一百台，一、二日后确实数目即可告知各厂进行订货。王、刘二人自涿鹿回来后，各厂厂商都进一步的深切了解面向农村是发展机器生产的光明大路，经各厂初步研究，已有五个厂决定大量赶造打稻机，三个厂决定赶造打草机、打包机、三个厂决定联合去该县开设加工碾米厂，信孚工厂并决定吸收游资，扩大生产。
