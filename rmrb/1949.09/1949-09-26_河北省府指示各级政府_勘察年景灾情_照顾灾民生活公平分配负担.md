The Hebei Provincial People's Government recently instructed all levels of government in the province to vigorously survey harvest conditions and disasters, in order to fairly and rationally distribute burdens. The instructions stated in brief: This year, due to water, wind, and insect disasters, some areas have suffered serious damage. Looking at the overall situation in the province, although a good harvest is expected in most areas, the financial tasks this year are still significant, and agricultural production must be vigorously developed. Therefore, the autumn grain requisition and distribution this year remains a complex and arduous task. All levels must organize forces, seek truth from facts, and earnestly survey the harvest conditions in various regions, prevent localism and the concept of bestowing favors by exaggerating disasters and underreporting harvests, in order to rationally distribute tasks, take care of the lives of people in disaster areas, ensure financial needs, and achieve a general balance of burdens. (1) The province should universally investigate, survey, and estimate the crop area and harvest yield. The focus of the work should be on disaster areas. For areas without significant disasters or with minor disasters, where the general harvest is above 65% of normal, the normal yield should be used for calculation. Only surveys and statistics of the main crop planting area and harvest volume should be conducted, in order to adjust the requisition varieties and implement the policy of "national need and people's ownership". Areas with complete crop failure and a reduction of more than 70% should receive full reduction or exemption, mainly to clarify the disaster area, reduced production, and people's living conditions, and study how to provide disaster relief through production. In semi-disaster areas, vigorous surveys should be organized to identify the disaster area, the extent of the disaster, the reduced production, and the people's ability to bear burdens as the basis for task allocation. (2) In terms of approach, the main reliance should be on promoting and organizing responsibility at each level. First, open up the minds of cadres, oppose localism, unify standards, and unify understanding. On the one hand, adopt a bottom-up, level-by-level investigation and evaluation; on the other hand, combine it with top-down large-scale inspections and key surveys. (3) Survey standards must be unified. Old areas with a production assessment basis should use the originally established normal yield as the basis for survey and statistics, and determine the reduction ratio by comparing the normal expected yield with the possible yield after the disaster this year. In areas where the previous production assessment was extremely untrue or there was no production assessment, the reduction ratio should be found mainly by comparing the possible yield without disaster this year and the yield after the disaster. In non-disaster areas, the reduction ratio will not be calculated, only the general harvest this year will be estimated. (4) Pay attention to seeking truth from facts and conducting in-depth investigations. In addition to general figures, timely collect information on the people's production and living conditions, as well as existing problems and reflections.

　　河北省府指示各级政府
  　勘察年景灾情
  　照顾灾民生活公平分配负担
    【保定电】河北省人民政府于日前指示全省各级政府大力勘察年景灾情，以便公平合理分配负担。指示略称：今年由于水、风、虫灾使部分地区遭受严重损害。从全省总的情况来看，虽有大部地区丰收可望，但今年财政任务仍然重大，而农业生产又必须大力发展；因此今年秋征分配仍是一个复杂艰巨的任务。各级必须组织力量，实事求是认真勘察各地年景，必须预防扩大灾情与少报收成的本位主义与恩赐观点，以便合理分配任务，照顾灾区人民生活，保证财政需要，作到负担大体平衡。（一）全省应普遍的调查勘察估计作物面积及年景收成，工作重点要放在灾区，对无显著灾害或灾情轻微地区一般年景在六成半以上者，即以常年产量计算，只作主要种植作物面积及收获量的调查统计，以便调剂征收品种，贯彻国需民有的政策。对全灾不收及减收百分之七十以上的地区全部减免，主要是分别弄清受灾面积、减收产量及人民生活情况，研究如何生产救灾。在半灾区则应组织大力勘察，找出各种作物受灾面积、受灾程度、减收产量及人民负担能力作为分配任务的依据。（二）在作法上主要依靠推动组织逐级负责。首先打通干部思想，反对本位主义，统一标准，统一认识，一方面采取自下而上的逐级调查评议，另一方面要结合自上而下的大量考察与重点勘察。（三）勘察标准必须统一，有评产基础的老区，均以原订常年产量作为勘察统计的根据，以其常年应产量及今年受灾可能产量比较确定减收比例。过去评产极不真实或是没有评产量的地区，主要是从今年不受灾可能产量及灾后产量比较，找出减收比例。非灾区不计算减收比例，只估计今年一般的收成。（四）要注意实事求是，深入调查，除一般数字外，并应及时搜集群众生产生活情况，及存在问题与反映。
