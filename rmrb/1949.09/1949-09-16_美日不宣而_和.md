US-Japan Unannounced "Peace"
By Markov, translated by Yue Liangjie

At the recent Paris Four Foreign Ministers Conference, the Soviet Union re-submitted the issue of rapidly concluding a peace treaty with Japan; without concluding a peace treaty with Japan, lasting peace in the Far East cannot be established.

The principles for concluding a peace treaty with Japan were stipulated long ago. All of this is found in the Potsdam Declaration, which determined that territorial issues, the issue of disarming Japan, and all major issues related to the conclusion of a peace treaty should be resolved through democratic means. The preparatory work for the treaty was to be undertaken by the Council of Foreign Ministers established by the Potsdam Conference. The Potsdam Conference decided that all participating countries of the Council of Foreign Ministers that signed the surrender terms should be invited to participate in the preparation of the peace treaty with the enemy country. Precisely because the preparatory work for the peace treaty with Japan was to be undertaken by the Council of Foreign Ministers, China, as a country that signed the Japanese surrender terms, was specifically included among the countries participating in the Council of Foreign Ministers.

This procedure was tested and proven to be practical during the preparation of peace treaties with the five Eastern European countries that had been allies of Hitler's Germany. However, the Soviet government's repeated suggestions to convene a special meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers to consider the issue of concluding a peace treaty with Japan have consistently met with stubborn opposition from the British and American governments.

First of all, it should be stated that any resolution made by the Council of Foreign Ministers must be unanimously agreed upon by all participating countries. Therefore, only resolutions passed in this way can be considered to safeguard the common interests of all countries. Only the signing of a treaty that can prevent the revival of Japanese militarism and eliminate all possibilities of Japan returning to being an aggressive nation, and guide it onto the path of democratic development, can satisfy the nations' yearning for lasting peace and security. Needless to say, the treaty must take into account the interests of the Asian nations that directly suffered from Japanese exploitation and aggression. At the same time, Japan's sovereignty must be maintained, conditions for the peaceful development of the Japanese people must be created, and all support must be given to the country's democratic forces.

While firmly advocating for the complete disarmament of Japan and the establishment of international control to prevent the revival of its military industry, the Soviet Union believes that its peaceful industry can and should be allowed to develop without restrictions. The development of Japanese industry and trade should not be determined by the interests of domestic and foreign monopoly capital, but should depend on the basic needs of the Japanese people.

These principles are fully in accordance with the Potsdam Declaration and the decisions of the Far Eastern Commission, and are also principles of democratic peace. The Soviet Union has consistently supported these principles during the three and a half years of occupying Japan.

The American authorities clearly have other intentions for Japan. Washington is using the excuse that Japan would "lose its security" if the American forces withdrew to prolong the occupation of Japan as much as possible, making Japan a permanently occupied country. In reality, the situation of not concluding a peace treaty is most suitable for American businessmen and the American military. "U.S. News & World Report" succinctly stated this point: "The United States is not eager to sign a treaty that would deprive the United States of the rights it now holds in Japan. On the contrary, it wants to maintain an unannounced peace in order to build up Japan."

The recent document published by the State Department, stating that Japan should be allowed to participate in international negotiations and conferences and to conclude agreements with other countries willing to make treaties, precisely shows how Washington intends to interpret "unannounced peace." The ruling class of Japan gladly accepted this proposal. Prime Minister Yoshida recently put forward a so-called "de facto peace relationship" plan that does not conclude a peace treaty with all relevant countries. This plan authorizes Japan to individually conclude agreements with one country on individual issues at an appropriate time. According to Yoshida, such agreements can actually replace a peace treaty.

It is obvious that such unilateral and temporary agreements are merely a deliberate delay in concluding a real peace treaty, and are nothing more than a separate peace with the United States. The reactionary rulers of Japan, knowing that their power relies on MacArthur's bayonets, and fearing direct confrontation with their own people, firmly advocate for the prolongation of the American occupation of Japan.

The organ of Japanese big business, "Oriental Economist," admits: "The mere thought of the Americans withdrawing makes one shudder."

"Unannounced peace" holds different interests for the American overlords. For those around MacArthur, continuing to occupy Japan primarily means that the Japanese people pay for their extravagant lifestyle. "New York Herald Tribune" said: "Wearing one or two stars on your epaulets guarantees you a magnificent residence provided by the Japanese government and many servants."

For merchants in New York and Chicago, occupying Japan is like finding a gold mine. Magat, the economic research director of MacArthur's headquarters, predicted: 1949 "will establish Japan as a solid base for investment."

Many envoys from Wall Street visit Japan systematically, alone or in groups, where they have discovered the best conditions for making profitable deals. Recently, they have been particularly focused, with one eye seeing another fact: as Morgan's "Fortune" magazine predicted, in the United States, "1949 will be a year to trim the sails and observe the falling barometer."

In the early days of the occupation of Japan by MacArthur's army, American monopoly capitalists had already begun to infiltrate the Japanese economy. One of the main means of controlling the Japanese economy is American investment and loans—loans from the Export-Import Bank, and loans from large private banks such as Citibank, Chase Bank, Henry Schroder Bank, and Bank of America.

But as time goes on, loans are increasingly being replaced by direct industrial investment. At a time when the disguised Marshall Plan has suffered a disastrous defeat in China, this trend in the United States is worth noting. Dodge, a banker from Detroit who was recently sent to MacArthur's headquarters as a financial advisor, told the Japanese that they should never expect further financial aid from the United States "like they did to Chiang Kai-shek." MacArthur's headquarters also does not act in this way. They advise American entrepreneurs to personally come to Japan to open businesses, or to operate them independently, or in partnership with the Japanese. As for the ground, it has already been carefully prepared.

The collusion between American and Japanese monopolists has gone very deep. The charade of liquidating the Japanese zaibatsu has proven to be a profitable activity. As a result, a large number of shares of Japanese entrepreneurs have entered the vaults of American companies. For example, Westinghouse Electric Corporation (Mellon) and Mobil Oil Corporation (Rockefeller), which had connections with the zaibatsu before the war, have seized more than half of Mitsubishi's shares; General Electric Corporation (Morgan) has acquired 45 percent of Mitsui's shares; International Telephone and Telegraph Corporation has acquired 35 percent of Sumitomo Chemical's shares, and so on. Interestingly, even General MacArthur, burdened with the important task of occupation, still had time to buy a large number of shares in Nippon Yusen Kaisha.

American banks and companies are opening branches and representative offices in Japan, further cooperating with Japanese monopoly capital, and, as usual, relegating them to a secondary position.

American businessmen are most enthusiastic about Japan's war industry. At present, the basic principle of American occupation policy is not to treat Japan as a conquered enemy that must be disarmed, but as a future ally and satellite state, and as the main industrial base of the already planned Pacific aggression group. The so-called economic stabilization plan aims to rebuild Japan's war machine. The American authorities are not restoring Japan's peaceful industry, but are striving to formulate plans to develop its war industry, which makes Japanese industrialists ecstatic.

It is interesting to see how American expansionists' plans for Japanese industry have changed with the growth of their greed and the formation of their aggressive intentions. The Pauley Commission, which visited Japan shortly after Japan's surrender, suggested that Japan's industrial production capacity should be limited to 500,000 tons of iron, 2.25 million tons of steel, and 1.5 million tons of rolled steel per year. The Strack Commission, which went to Japan in the spring of 1948 to investigate for the American defense authorities, suggested that Japan should be allowed to produce 8 million tons of steel per year. But even this was too little in the eyes of American militarists. Another committee, headed by Marshall Plan executor Hoffman, also visited Japan last December, and they drafted a plan stipulating that by 1955, Japan could produce 6 million tons of iron, 11 million tons of steel, and 12 million tons of rolled steel. If we recall that in the first year of the Pacific War, Japan only produced 6.8 million tons of steel, then it is clear that the recent American plan to develop Japan's steel industry is not based on the country's peacetime needs.

Equally significant is the American plan to restore Japan's aluminum industry, which currently has a production capacity of 90,000 tons per year, several times the country's peacetime needs. According to the Pauley plan, all aluminum factories would be relocated for reparations. But the subsequent investigators unanimously insisted that Japan must retain its entire aluminum industry. America's massive armament program has created a large demand for aluminum, which American industry cannot fully supply. In 1948, the United States was short of about 20 percent of aluminum. This has led to several visits to Japan by representatives of American aluminum companies. Manhattan Copper Company, which supplies aluminum to "Aluminum Company of America," recently signed a large contract with Japanese industrialists. Reynolds Metals Company is another aluminum factory very active in Japan. The American authorities have ordered the annual import of 100,000 tons of bauxite into Japan.

As for the shipbuilding industry, all considerations of international security have been disregarded. Japan can retain all shipyards, with a total shipbuilding capacity of 800,000 tons per year. Last year, Japanese shipbuilding companies signed contracts to build large ships, including 18,000-ton oil tankers, which exceeded the tonnage limits set by the Far Eastern Commission.

From these openly attempted actions to restore Japan's industrial war-making capacity, it is clear why the reparations demands, one of the main purposes of occupying Japan, have not been realized to this day. The reparations issue has been the subject of research by more than a dozen American special committees, which have successively reduced the reparations plan, until finally it was simply written off.

American economic plans propose to restore Japan's past economic position in East Asia, making it a center, with other Asian countries serving as its source of raw materials and market. According to the "division of labor" planned by the Draper Committee's recommendations, the United States will export cotton to Japan, Japan will manufacture textiles and sell them to Indonesia, and Indonesia will not settle the account with Japan, but will export tin and other strategic raw materials to the United States to repay the United States for the raw materials imported into Japan.

This is a policy of delaying and preventing the industrial progress of other Asian countries and strengthening Japan as Wall Street's main agent in the Far East. American monopoly capitalists intend to use Japan to not only exploit this rich region, but also to prevent and suppress the democratic movements of various nations. What Japan exports to Asian countries is not industrial equipment, but consumer goods made in Japan. For example, Japanese textiles flood Manila, while at the same time the amount of textiles owned by each person in Japan is only one-fifth of what it was before the war.

The American authorities control Japan's foreign trade and use it as one of the means of enslaving the country. In Japan's import trade, the United States actually occupies a monopoly position. Therefore, the trade deficit is so large that by the end of last year, Japan's trade debt to the United States amounted to $974,100,000. The price paid for imported goods averages three times the official price on the Japanese domestic market, while exported goods are sold at almost one-third of the world market price. In order to prevent Japanese monopoly capital from suffering losses, the government subsidizes them with billions of yen in subsidies, which are paid for by increasing the taxes of the working people.

The reform plan that MacArthur's headquarters sings about so loudly is, as we know, nothing but a blank check. Land reform has not actually been realized to this day. Regarding the liquidation of the zaibatsu, even the mild and reluctant instructions issued by the occupation authorities have gradually dissolved in the hands of the American military headquarters themselves.

Because of fear of the victory of China's democratic forces influencing the Japanese people, the rulers of the United States and Japan have completely abandoned the pretense of supporting "democracy" in practice. A naked reactionary and anti-reform period has begun. In February, the trade union law was amended for the worse. Also in that month, the American government gave MacArthur a secret instruction to abolish the cleansing order of January 4, 1946. This secret order restored all the past rights of those who had been purged. They can now actively participate in political and economic life. MacArthur recently ordered the cessation of the trial of war criminals.

"U.S. News & World Report," when talking about the basic principles of American policy toward Japan, calmly declared: "In the future, the entire program of democratization of Japan will not be given much importance." It also said that Washington is prepared to allow Japan to "make any changes" to the constitution as they please. The Tokyo Diet has already taken full advantage of this in its recent resolution to expand police forces. The constitution does not allow Japan to have naval and land forces, but this resolution is a disguised amendment to the constitution. According to the "New York Times": "The United States is carefully considering establishing a Japanese defense force of at least 125,000 people."

The newspaper further said that due to the continuous increase in the number of unemployed people, it would be a simple matter for the Japanese army to recruit soldiers. American personnel in Tokyo are discussing the plan to establish an air transport company and restore the air force. In this year's total budget of 705 billion yen, the appropriations for military and strategic purposes are constantly increasing under the guise of occupation fees and other expenses.

The American occupation forces headquarters has begun a massive plan for Japanese military construction. Airports are being built, strategic roads are being built, and naval ports are being rebuilt. MacArthur recently declared frankly to a reporter from the "Daily Mail" that he had built "25 airports on Okinawa Island that can accommodate 3,500 B-29 aircraft takeoffs per day." He continued: "From Singapore to Vladivostok, the entire East Asia will be within the range of these aircraft."

With each month that the peace treaty with Japan is delayed, Washington's policies are gradually undermining the foundation of peace and security in the Far East established by the nations' victory over imperialism. This is why world public opinion, including progressives in the United States itself, is demanding the restoration of the principles of the Potsdam Declaration and the rapid conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan.

　　美日不宣而“和”
    马尔柯夫作约良节译
    在最近的巴黎四外长会议中，苏联重新提出了迅速对日缔结和约的问题；不缔结对日和约，远东的持久和平是不可能建立的。
    缔结对日和约的原则是早已规定了的。这一切都见于波茨坦宣言，其中确定了关于疆域问题，解除日本武装问题，及一切与缔结和约有关的重大问题，都经由民主途径解决。缔约的准备工作，由波茨坦会议决定设立的外长会议来担任。波茨坦会议决定：凡签字于投降条款的外长会议参加国，均应被邀请参加对该敌国的和约的准备工作。正因为对日和约的准备工作是要由外长会议担任的，中国是在日本投降条款上签字的国家，也特别包括在参加外长会议的国家之内。
    在对东欧五个曾为希特勒德国同盟者的国家的和约准备工作中，这一程序曾经过考验，证明是切实可行的。但是，苏联政府每次建议召集外长会议的特别会议，以考虑对日缔结和约问题时，总是受到英美政府的顽强反对。
    首先应该说明：外长会议作出的任何决议，都必须得到参加各国的一致同意。因而只有这样通过的决议，才可被认为保障了所有国家的共同利益。只有签订一个能防止日本军国主义复活及使日本恢复为侵略国家的一切可能性、并将其引向民主发展的道路的条约，才能满足各民族对持久和平与安全的渴求。不待言，条约必须照顾到曾直接遭受日本剥削和侵略的亚洲民族的利益。同时必须保持日本的主权，创造日本人民和平发展的条件，并给该国的民主力量以一切支持。
    苏联一方面坚决主张彻底解除日本武装，建立国际管制，以阻止其军事工业的复活，同时认为可以而且应该允许其和平工业不受限制地发展。日本工业与贸易的发展，不应由国内外的垄断资本利益来决定，而应取决于日本人民的基本需要。
    这些原则完全遵照波茨坦宣言及远东委员会的决定，而且也是民主和平的原则。在占领日本三年半以来，苏联一贯拥护这些原则。
    美国当局对日本，显然是别有企图。华盛顿正借口如果美军撤退日本即“失去保障”，而尽可能谋得延长占领日本，使日本永久成为被占领国家。实际上，不缔结和约的情况，最适合于美国商人和美国军部。“美国新闻与世界报导”曾简明扼要地说出了这一点：“美国不急于签订一个将会剥夺美国现在在日本掌握着的权利之和约。相反地，她要保持不宣而和，以建立日本。”
    国务院最近发表的文件说，已经应该准许日本参加国际谈判与会议，准许她和其它愿意缔约的国家缔结协定了；这正说明了华盛顿对于“不宣而和”准备如何解释。日本的统治阶级欣然接受了这个提议。吉田首相最近提出了一个不与一切有关国家签订和约的所谓“事实上的和约关系”方案。这个方案中授权日本在适当时机可与一个国家在单个问题上单独缔结协定。按照吉田的意见，这样一些协定，实际上可代替和约。
    显而易见，这种片面的暂时协定，只不过是蓄意拖延缔结真正的和约而已，而且也不过是和美国单独媾和罢了。日本反动统治者，知道他们的权力是依靠着麦克阿瑟的刺刀，他们唯恐弄到直接面对自己人民的地步，就坚主延长美国占领日本。
    日本大商业家的机关刊物“东方经济学者”承认：“只要一想到美国人撤退，就使人战栗。”
    “不宣而和”对于美国太上皇们来说，各有其不同的利益。对于麦克阿瑟周围的人，继续占领日本，首先意味着日本人民花钱让他们过奢侈的生活。“纽约先驱论坛报”说：“肩章上戴有一两个星子，就可以保证你有日本政府供奉的一所富丽堂皇的住所和许多仆役。”
    对于纽约和芝加哥商人来说，占领日本就是获得了一座金矿。麦克阿瑟总部的经济研究部长马加特预言：一九四九年“将日本建立为一个投资的巩固基地。”
    许多华尔街的使者，有计划地单独或成群访问日本，他们在那里发现了做赚钱生意的最好的条件。近来，他们特别聚精会神，一只眼看到另一件事实：如摩根的“幸运”杂志所预见的那样，在美国国内，“一九四九年将是宜于收帆转舵，观察气压下降的一个年头”。
    在麦克阿瑟军队占领日本的初期，美国垄断资本家即已开始渗入日本的经济。进行控制日本经济的主要手段之一，即是美国的投资及贷款—进出口银行的贷款，和花旗银行、大通银行、亨利歇洛德银行、美国银行等大私人银行的贷款。
    但是随着时间的推移，贷款正愈来愈被直接的工业投资所代替。正当变相的马歇尔计划在中国遭到惨败的时候，美国这种动向是值得我们注意的。新近派到麦克阿瑟统帅部作财政顾问的底特律城的银行家道奇告诉日本人说，他们绝不要期待美国“象对蒋介石那样”的进一步的金钱补助。麦克阿瑟总部也不这样作，他们建议美国企业家亲自来日本开业，或由他们独自经营，或与日本人合伙经营。至于地盘，那是已经小心准备好了的。
    美国与日本垄断家的勾结，已经进行得很深了。清算日本财阀的把戏，证明了是能够获利的活动。这样的结果，日本企业家的大量股票都走进了美国公司的保险箱。例如战前即已和财阀有连系的西屋电气公司（梅隆）和美孚油公司（洛克斐勒），已攫取了三菱股票的一半以上；通用电气公司（摩根）取得三井股票的百分之四十五；国际电信公司取得住友化学公司股票的百分之三十五等等。有趣的是，连麦克阿瑟将军负有占领的重任，却还有功夫在日本邮船株式会社买了一大批股票。
    美国银行和公司正在日本开设分行和代办处，进一步和日本垄断资本合作，而且，照例地把他们降到次要的地位。
    美国商业家对日本的战争工业感到最狂热的兴趣。目前，美国占领政策的基本原则，乃是不把日本当作一个必须解除武装的、被征服的敌人，而当作将来的盟国和卫星国，当作已经策划了的太平洋侵略集团的主要工业基地。所谓经济稳定计划，目的就在于重建日本的战争机构。美国当局，不是恢复日本的和平工业，而是在努力制订发展其战争工业的计划，这使日本的工业家们欢欣若狂。
    看看美国扩张主义者们关于日本工业的计划，怎样随着他们贪欲的增长及侵略意图的形成而起着变化，是很有趣的。日本投降后不久就去访问日本的鲍莱委员会，建议日本的工业生产力应限于每年生产五十万吨铁，二百二十五万吨钢，和一百五十万吨辗钢。一九四八年春为美国国防当局去日本调查的斯揣克委员会则建议准许日本每年生产八百万吨钢。但就这，在美国的军国主义者们看来，亦太少了。另外一个以马歇尔计划执行人霍夫曼为首的委员会，去年十二月也访问了日本，他们起草了一个计划，规定一九五五年，日本可出产六百万吨铁，一千一百万吨钢，以及一千二百万吨辗钢。如果我们回忆在太平洋战争的第一年中，日本只出产了六百八十万吨钢，那么美国最近发展日本钢铁工业的计划，不是基于该国的平时需要，是很显然的了。
    同样有意义的是美国关于恢复日本铝工业的计划，它的目前生产能力是每年九万吨，数倍于该国底平时需要。按照鲍莱计划，所有的铝工厂，将予迁移以作赔偿之用。但是继来的调查者们异口同声地坚持日本必须保留全部的铝工业。美国庞大武装计划产生了对铝的大量需要，这是美国工业所不能完全供应的。一九四八年美国大约缺少百分之二十的铝。这就引起了美国铝工业的公司代表们几番到日本访问。供应铝给“美国铝公司”的曼赫顿铜公司，最近和日本工业家们订立了一个庞大的合同。雷诺兹金属公司是美国在日本非常活跃的另一个铝工厂。美国当局已命令每年对日本输入十万吨铁矾土。
    至于说到造船工业，那是一切国际安全的考虑都被置之不理的。日本可以保留所有的船坞，每年共能造船八十万吨。去年日本造船公司订立了建造大型船只的合同，这些船只包括一万八千吨的油船在内，都超过了远东委员会所规定的吨数限制。
    从这些公开企图恢复日本工业作战力的行动看来，占领日本主要目的之一的赔偿要求，为什么直到今天还没有实现，就很清楚了。赔偿问题曾经是十几个美国特别委员会所研究的主题，这些委员会相继的缩减了赔偿计划，以至到最后索性一笔勾销了。
    美国的经济计划提出要恢复日本过去在东亚的经济地位，把她作为一个中心，而亚洲其他各国充当她的原料来源和市场。依照德雷柏委员会建议书所计划的“分工”，美国要向日本输出棉花，日本制造成纺织品卖给印度尼西亚，而印尼不和日本算这项帐，却向美国输出锡以及其他战略性的原料，这样来偿付美国输入日本的原料。
    这是一种延缓与阻止其他亚洲国家工业进展与加强日本作为华尔街在远东的主要代理人的政策。美国垄断资本家，打算借助于日本，不仅要剥削这个富饶的区域，并且要阻止与镇压各民族的民主运动。日本输出到亚洲各国的不是工业装备，而是日本货的消费品。举例说，日本纺织品充斥马尼刺，而同时日本本国每人所有纺织品数量仅是战前的五分之一。
    美国当局左右着日本的国外贸易，而且用它作为奴役这个国家的手段之一。在日本的进口贸易方面，美国实际上占了垄断的地位。所以入超数字很大，以至在去年年底，日本对美的贸易欠款数至九七四，一○○，○○○美元。付给输入货物的价格平均三倍于日本国内市场的官价，而输出的货物却以几乎不及世界市场价格的三分之一出卖。为了使日本垄断资本不受损失，政府补助他们达数十亿日圆的津贴，这笔款用增加劳动人民的租税来支付。
    麦克阿瑟总部高唱入云的改革计划，据我们所知，不过是一张空头支票。土地改革实际上一直到今天还没有实现。关于清算财阀，即使是占领当局所发布的温和且勉强的指令，也逐渐在美军总部自己手中化为泡影了。
    因为惧怕中国民主力量的胜利影响日本人民，美国与日本的统治者已经完全在实际上抛弃了拥护“民主”的假面具。一个赤裸裸的反动的反改革的时期已经开始了。二月间，工会法愈益向坏处修改了。亦就在那一月，美国政府给了麦克阿瑟一个秘密指令，废除一九四六年一月四日的清洗命令。这个秘令恢复了那些被清洗者过去的一切权利。他们现在可以在政治与经济生活中积极活动了。麦克阿瑟最近更命令停止审判战争罪犯。
    “美国新闻与世界报导”讲到美国对日政策的基本原则时，安详地声称：“今后对日本民主化的全部纲领将不甚重视。”并说华盛顿准备允许日本对宪法随他们高兴地“作任何的变更”。东京国会在最近决议扩大警察力量时，已经充分地利用了这一点。宪法不许日本有海陆军，可是这个决议就是宪法的变相修改。据“纽约时报”说：“美国在慎重考虑建立一个为数至少十二万五千人的日本国防军。”
    这个报纸更说，由于失业者的不断增加，日本军队要招兵是一件很简单的事。在东京的美国人士对于那个建立航空运输公司与恢复空军的计划，正加以讨论。在今年总数七千零五十亿日圆的预算中，对军事的及战略性目的的拨款，在占领费及其他开支项目的伪装下，是不断地在增加着。
    美国占领军总部已开始了一个日本军事建设的庞大计划。飞机场正在修建中，战略性的道路亦正在建筑，海军军港正在重建着。麦克阿瑟最近向“每日邮报”记者谈话，坦白地宣称，在冲绳岛他修建了“二十五个飞机场，每天能容纳Ｂ—２９式飞机起飞三千五百次”。他继称：“从新嘉坡到海参崴，整个东亚将置于这些飞机的航程之内。”
    对日和约逐月地迟延下去，华盛顿的政策也就逐步地破坏着各民族由于战胜帝国主义而建立的远东和平与安全的基础。这就是为什么世界舆论，包括美国本国进步分子在内，都在要求着恢复波茨坦宣言的原则和迅速缔结对日和约。
