Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 4th: TASS, Bucharest - Romanian newspapers continued to publish articles on the 2nd commenting on the Soviet government's note to the Yugoslav government. The Independent Democratic Universe newspaper pointed out that the rulers of Belgrade ignored the criticisms of the fraternal communist parties and did not feel it necessary to change their position. The Tito government has proven that its fascist stance, harmful to peace and socialism, is not accidental. Yugoslavia's foreign policy is fascist. Repeated provocations against the Albanian border and against democratic Greece, the illegal dissemination of fascist printed matter in the people's democratic countries, and especially the vile slander against the Soviet Union, all prove not only that the Yugoslav government has fallen into the quagmire of fascism, but also reveal the depth of its degeneration. The Romanian Freedom Daily stated: The rising tide of people's struggle will engulf the fascist bandits - the sworn enemies of peace and democracy. The piratical Tito clique can have no other fate than to repeat the fate of its ancestors Hitler, Mussolini, and their accomplices. The Tito clique will receive the punishment it deserves for its crimes.

　　铁托法西斯政策必蹈希特勒覆辙
  　罗报续评苏致南照会
    【新华社北平四日电】塔斯社布加勒斯特讯，罗马尼亚报纸二日继续刊文评论苏联政府致南斯拉夫政府照会。独立民主派宇宙报指出，贝尔格莱德统治者对各兄弟共产党的批评置之不理，而且并不觉得要改变他们的立场。铁托政府证明了它的有害于和平与社会主义的法西斯立场并不是偶然的。南斯拉夫的外交政策是法西斯的。对阿尔巴尼亚边界和对民主希腊的多次挑衅，在人民民主国家里非法传播法西斯的印刷品，特别是对苏联的卑劣的诽谤，这一切不仅证明南斯拉夫政府已堕入法西斯的泥淖，而且也显露了它堕落之深。罗马尼亚自由报称：日益增长的人民斗争的浪潮将吞没法西斯匪帮——和平与民主的不共戴天的敌人。海盗似的铁托集团除了重蹈其祖宗希特勒、墨索里尼及其同伙们的命运之外，不能有其他命运。铁托集团将因其罪行而受到应得的惩罚。
