Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, our Youth League must, with the spirit of a shock force, unite all patriotic working youth and intellectual youth, enthusiastically participate in the great work of building a new China, and become a loyal assistant to the People's Government.
    We wish the conference success!"

    National Organizations of Social Sciences, Natural Sciences, and Literary and Art Circles
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 26th] National social science, natural science, and literary and art circles sent telegrams congratulating the opening of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. The preparatory committee of the All-China Social Sciences Workers Representative Conference said in its congratulatory telegram: "We believe that the success of the work you are now carrying out on behalf of the will of the entire Chinese people demonstrates that Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought have begun to gain victory in China. Such a victory will be consolidated and have unlimited prospects for development. We—social science workers across the country—must work hard to learn and participate in the great cause of economic and cultural construction of the new China together with the people of the whole country." The preparatory committee of the All-China Natural Science Workers Representative Conference said in its congratulatory telegram: "Science serving the people has fully realized possibilities. We will unite more strongly and widely, and under the leadership of the Central People's Government, following the program and resolutions indicated by the conference, work wholeheartedly to develop natural science to serve the construction of industry, agriculture, health care, and national defense." The All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles said in its congratulatory telegram: "This is a great joy for the Chinese people, this is a new beginning for Chinese history."

    China Democratic League Vietnam Branch, etc.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 26th] The Vietnam Branch of the China Democratic League and the Vietnam Branch of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party jointly sent a telegram on the 23rd congratulating the victorious opening of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. The telegram stated: Overseas Chinese in Vietnam have never received genuine care from their motherland and have suffered humiliation and persecution from French imperialism. They have long yearned for the emergence of an independent, free, democratic, and unified new China. Today, this wish has finally come true, and we feel boundless excitement. To ensure the success of revolutionary construction, we hope to learn from the experience of the Soviet Union, consolidate the friendship with the new democratic countries of Eastern Europe, resolutely lean to one side, and eliminate the aggressive conspiracy of American imperialism.

"We are advancing bravely, pursuing and annihilating the remaining bandit troops of Hu Ma, and completely liberating the Great Northwest as a gift to the conference." The congratulatory telegram from the Third Army Corps said: "All our commanders and fighters congratulate the success of the conference and the birth of the People's Republic of China with infinite excitement and enthusiasm, and resolutely fight to the end to complete the task of marching, thoroughly annihilate the remaining Chiang Kai-shek and Bai Chongxi bandits, liberate all of China, and defend the independence and freedom of the new China."
