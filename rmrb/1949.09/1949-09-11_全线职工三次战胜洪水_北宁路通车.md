　　Entire Line of Workers Triumph Over Floods Three Times
　  Beining Railway Reopens to Traffic

　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 10th: The large bridge on the Beining Railway between Juluhe and Xinglongdian stations, which was destroyed by floods, has been repaired by railway workers. Direct express trains between Beiping and Shenyang resumed operation on the 9th.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 10th: Since the beginning of autumn, the Beining Railway has suffered three flood impacts. The floods were the largest in decades. Railway bridges were destroyed, but after the heroic efforts of the workers, they were finally repaired three times in one month.
　　Since the end of July, continuous rain has plagued the South Manchuria area. On August 6th, torrential rain caused the dikes of large and small rivers crossing the Beining Railway to burst, flooding the area. From Xinmin in the north to Shanhaiguan in the south, over 300 kilometers of railway lines were submerged, with water reaching the rooftops in the deepest areas. Over 140 sections of the line were severely damaged. The 70-ton steel beams of the Daling River Railway Bridge were washed away to a place 15 kilometers away. In some places, the rails and sleepers were washed away, and the roadbed was eroded into water pits as deep as 10 meters, with hundreds of cars of stones dumped in without a trace. In one location, a kilometer-long roadbed was completely washed away, and none of the three parallel bridges were usable. A signal yard and platform were washed away, and the railway line turned into a river, with water depths reaching over 9 meters.
　　The repair work faced extremely serious difficulties. Both sides of the line were covered in mud, and there was a severe shortage of dry soil and gravel for filling the roadbed. Trains could not reach the site, materials could not be supplied, and residents of the towns and villages along the line, who had suffered from the flooding, could not provide much assistance.
　　However, the repair workers did not flinch and launched an unusually intense and difficult battle against the disaster. On August 7th, the Jinzhou Railway Bureau formed a repair team of over 5,000 people, from the director to the workers of various stations and sections, and rushed to the disaster area. Employees of the Northeast Railway General Bureau and the Harbin, Shenyang, and other railway bureaus also formed repair teams and went to reinforce the effort in the rain. When vehicles could not pass, they repaired and advanced simultaneously. From Baiqibao to Shanhaiguan, the nearly 300-kilometer railway line was filled with a busy, flowing crowd: carrying stones, wielding shovels and picks, driving piles and building bridges… Women cooked and delivered meals, and at night, lights shone everywhere, as bright as day, with work continuing through the night. Revolutionary competitions unfolded everywhere, and new records and moving model actions were transmitted to all locations via mobile blackboard newspapers. Here, 22 people unloaded a 26-ton carload of furnace ash in just 3 minutes and 20 seconds; there, 30 tons of rubble were unloaded from a train in just 10 minutes. Workers at one location, in order to get the train through as soon as possible to supply stones for filling the water pits, many people did not sleep for three consecutive days and nights. Because of the shortage of stones, as soon as stones were discovered in the water, swarms of workers jumped into the rapids to retrieve them. It was through such struggles that the first repair project was finally completed.
　　On the eve of resuming traffic, on the evening of August 14th, a second torrential rain struck unexpectedly. The floodwaters were more violent than the first, and the newly repaired line was severely damaged again. The workers were not discouraged and immediately began work again on the 15th with renewed vigor, finally restoring traffic on the 29th. However, on the 29th, a third flood struck again, and six spans of the railway bridge between Xinglongdian Station and Juluhe, west of Shenyang, were skewed. The repair workers then rose up for the third time to repair the damage, finally completing the entire project for the third time on September 8th. On September 9th, the Beining Railway resumed traffic.

　　全线职工三次战胜洪水
　  北宁路通车
    【新华社北平十日电】北宁路巨流河与兴隆店车站间被洪水冲毁的大桥，业经铁路职工修复，平沈直达快车已于九日恢复行驶。
    【新华社沈阳十日电】入秋以来，北宁路遭受了三次洪水冲击，洪水之大是几十年来没有的，铁路桥梁被冲毁，但经过职工们的英勇奋斗，在一个月的时间中，终于三次修复。
    自七月底起，南满地区即阴雨连绵，至八月六日，复倾盆暴雨，致横越北宁路的大小河流决堤泛滥，北起新民南至山海关，三百余公里的铁路沿线到处一片汪洋，水最深处淹没房脊，线路遭严重冲毁者达一百四十余处。大凌河铁桥七十余吨重的钢梁亦被冲到十五里以外。有些地方更被洪水冲得铁轨、枕木搬家，路基被冲成深达十米的水坑，成百车石头倒下去亦不见影迹。某处长达一公里的道床被冲得全无踪影，平行三座桥梁无一能用。某信号场和站台而被冲走了，线路变成河流，水深达九米多。
    修复工程面临着极端严重的困难。线路两侧多是泥水，垫路基的干土和碎石异常缺乏。而火车又不能通达现场，器材无法供应，沿线村镇居民遭受水洗，亦无法给予很多的援助。
    但是抢修的职工们没有畏缩，与水灾展开了一场异常紧张而艰难的大搏斗。八月七日，锦州铁路局管理局，上自局长下至各站段职工组成了五千余人的抢修大队奔向灾区。东北铁路总局及哈尔滨、沈阳和其他铁路局员工们，也分别组成抢修大队，冒雨增援。当车辆通不过时，他们就一面抢修一面前进。从白旗堡到山海关，近三百公里的铁道线上，到处流动着紧张忙碌的人群：搬抬石头、挥动锹镐，打桩架桥……妇女做饭送饭，入夜则灯火四起，俨如白昼，澈夜地工作着。革命的竞赛在各处展开着，新的纪录，动人的模范行动，由流动黑板报传递各处。这里是二十二个人只用三分二十秒卸了一辆载重二十六吨的炉灰车，那里是只用了十分钟的时间就从车上卸下了三十吨片石。某处职工为了使火车早日通过，以供给填塞水坑的石头，许多人一连三天三夜没有睡觉。因为缺乏石头只要刚一发现水里有石头，霎时就有成群的工人跳下急流去打捞。就是经过这样的奋斗，终于完成了第一次抢修工程。
    正在恢复通车的前夕，在八月十四日晚，却不料又遭到第二次暴雨，水势比第一次更加凶猛，刚刚修好的线路又受到严重的毁坏。职工们没有一点沮丧，立即以再接再厉的精神，重于十五日开始工作，终于在二十九日恢复通车。但又正在二十九日，遭到了第三次洪水袭击，沈阳以西兴隆店站至巨流河间之铁桥被冲歪了六孔。于是抢修的职工们又第三次奋起抢修，终于在九月八日，第三次修复全部工程，九月九日，北宁路恢复了通车。
