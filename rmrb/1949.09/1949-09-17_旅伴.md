　　The Fellow Traveler
    By Soviet author Panova, translated by Su Ling, proofread by Cao Jinghua

    　　　　Part One: Night
    Chapter Four: Yulia

    But Yulia did not see Pskov.

    The train had been dragging along the crisscrossing tracks for a long time, surrounded by freight cars, the noise roaring in her ears, and the trenches were shrouded in black smoke. Sometimes bombs exploded, and then the red sky could be seen. The train stopped. Yulia called for a nurse.
    "Mukhina! Go to the commander's car and find out where the commander and the commissar are."
    She stood there doing nothing, feeling uneasy, sure that someone around her needed help.
    "Are there no orders?"
    "Wait a moment, Yulia. Shall I get out of the car and run to see?"
    "You know that no one is allowed to leave the car, don't you? Go back into the car."
    Mukhina left. The train next to the dressing car window started. The tightly closed carriages flashed before her eyes for a long time—leaving the city—the train left. Another train stopped behind it, but it was always much brighter, and the flames could already be seen: now one, now another flame, rushing into that terrible, smoky, red sky… The ambulance train also began to move towards the station, it drove into that red light, lonely, without any cover, carrying its red cross, stopping there. Everything around was burning madly.
    Mukhina returned.
    "How are things there?"
    "Yulia, the commander ordered you not to go anywhere either. The political commissar has gone to the evacuation service station to ask for instructions."
    "How interesting, does he think I can go there?" Yulia asked with proud curiosity.
    The train started again. It was near the station. Everything around was burning. No one was putting out the fire. People were running around. Four people were standing on the platform: three people in civilian clothes with suitcases, and the fourth was Danilov.
    "Surgeons!" Mukhina automatically ran to the commander's car to report. "The evacuation service station has sent us three surgeons, they will be operating here."
    Surgeons! This real work made Yulia's heart burn with joy. Treatment… what is that considered? …In Yulia's view, this is not medicine, it is like palm reading. But these three people in civilian clothes, carrying suitcases, brought real medicine to this ambulance car. Performing surgery on the train is the first step in treating injuries!
    She quickly calculated: three surgeons—three tables. One in the dressing room, and the other two in the washing room. There are enough instruments; gowns, gloves—also enough. Who will be the assistants? First of all, of course, Yulia. Secondly, Suprunov. No, he has neurasthenia. The second is assistant medical officer Olga, and the third is Pina.
    "Mukhina! Close the windows in the washing room. Turn on the lights. Take off all the lampshades. Wash the tables with mercury chloride."
    Crash! The window of the dressing room was blown out by the explosion. Broken glass scattered all over the carriage.
    Mukhina made the sign of the cross. She had never done this before, but now she was doing it, not knowing why.
    Yulia glanced at her with a contemptuous look.
    "Mukhina! I'll wash the tables myself. You clean up the broken glass."
    The real work began.
    Pina was right: half an hour later, there wasn't a single piece of glass left in the medical car.
    The nurses were clearing away the glass shards. They were all very scared. Two young ladies had already cried. But what was even more infuriating was that the Germans had destroyed such good carriages.
    "I'm really working hard!" Mukhina said softly, putting the glass shards into the dustpan.
    The fat girl, Iyah, couldn't bear it any longer. She violated the ban and ran out of the car. She felt that a bomb crater behind the burning station was the most reliable air-raid shelter. No one could catch her. She came back by herself the next day, covered in black ash, with clumps of mud in her hair, and her eyelashes singed.
    Danilov assembled the ambulance team: nurses, medics, guards. Nevitsky came.
    "I'll go with you," he said.
    "Then what about the electricity?" Danilov asked.
    "Khrabrov is taking care of it. He knows what to do. It's daylight now..."
    "No, natural light won't work today: we still have to perform surgery."
    "Khrabrov……"
    "What can Khrabrov do? Khrabrov is a driver, and you are the electrician. You have to stay here."
    "I'm not staying here, do whatever you want," Pina said. "I'm a front-line person, a battlefield person, neither bombs nor shells can do anything to me."
    Danilov couldn't help but smile at her boasting.
    "Pina, I can't take you, the commander assigned you to the surgical room."
    "I can't, Pina: the commander wants you to take charge of the surgical work."
    "What bad luck!" Pina said, "I'm really unlucky! Take my medicine bag, miss," Lina was standing on the platform, her hands behind her back, looking up with that boyish head, Pina said to her. "Take my medicine bag, you reckless and capable person."
    "Doctor," Danilov said to Suprunov, "the whole of Europe is watching us."

    　　　　第一部　夜
    第四章　尤丽
    可是尤丽没有看见普斯科夫。
    列车好久的在纵横交错的轨道上拖着，两边全是货车，耳朵里轰轰乱响着，战壕里也被烟笼罩成黑的了。有时炸弹爆炸了，那时可以看见被火映得通红的天空。火车停了。尤丽把一个护士叫来。
    “穆恒娜！你去司令车里看一看，打听司令和委员在那儿。”
    她什么事也不作的站着，觉得很不安，周围一定有人需要救护呢。
    “没有什么命令吗？”
    “等一等，尤丽。我下车快跑去看看好不好？”
    “谁都不能离车的命令，难道你不知道吗？到车里去。”
    穆恒娜去了。停在裹伤车窗跟前的那列火车开动了。紧紧闭着的车厢，成好久的在眼前闪着——离开了城市——列车开走了。列车后边又停了一列车，不过总是亮得多了，火舌已经看得见了：忽儿一个，忽而又一个火舌，冲到那可怕的、烟气弥漫的通红的天空里……救护列车也开始向车站跟前移动了，它开到那火红的光地里，孤孤的，毫无掩蔽的带着自己的红十字，停在那儿。左右都疯狂的燃烧起来了。
    穆恒娜回来了。
    “他们那儿怎么样？”
    “尤丽，司令吩咐叫你那也别去。政治委员到撤退服务站去请示去了。”
    “真有意思，他想我能到那儿去呢？”尤丽高傲的好奇的问着。
    火车又开了。开到车站附近了。周围都在燃烧着。没人救火。人都在乱跑着。月台边上站着四个人：三个便服的人带着手提箱，第四个是达尼洛夫。
    “外科医生！”穆恒娜自动的跑到司令车上告诉着。“撤退服务站给我们派了三位外科医生，他们将在这儿动手术呢。”
    外科医生呵！这真正的工作，使尤丽的心高兴得燃烧起来了。治疗呵。这算得什么呢？……在尤丽看来，这不是医学，这类乎看手相术似的。可是，这三位穿着便服，提着手提箱的人，把真正的医学，带到这救护车上来了。在列车上动手术，这是治伤的初步呵！
    她很快的计算着：三位外科医生——三张桌子。一张在裹伤室，另两张放到洗涤室里。器械够用了；衣罩，手套——也够用了。谁当助手呢？首先当然是尤丽。其次是苏普鲁戈夫。不，他神经衰弱。第二是助理军医娥尔加，第三是裴娜。
    “穆恒娜！把洗涤室的窗子关起来。把灯扭开。把灯罩都下了。用升汞把桌子洗一洗。”
    哗啦！裹伤室的窗子被爆炸震飞了。破玻璃片乱撒在车厢里。
    穆恒娜画着十字。她从来没有这么作过，而现在这么作着，自己也不晓得为什么。
    尤丽含着鄙视的神情，对她望了一眼。
    “穆恒娜！我自己来洗桌子。你把碎玻璃收拾收拾。”
    真正的工作开始了。
    裴娜是对的：半小时之后，药车里连一块玻璃也没有了。
    护士们清除着玻璃片。她们都很害怕。两个小姐已经骇哭了。可是更其令人愤慨的是德国人把这样好的车厢都毁坏了。
    “我真卖力呵！”穆恒娜把玻璃片往铁铲里收拾着，低声说。
    胖子咦呀忍不住了。她违犯了禁令，下车跑了。正在燃烧着的车站后边的一个炸弹穴，她觉得是一个最可靠的防空壕。没得把她抓住。第二天她自己回来了，满身都是黑灰，头发里是泥土块，睫毛也被烧焦了。
    达尼洛夫召集了救护队：护士，卫生兵，卫士。尼威茨基来了。
    “我同你一块儿去，”他说着。
    “那么，电灯怎么办呢？”达尼洛夫问道。
    “克拉错夫照看着。他懂得的。现在天亮着呢……”
    “不，天然的光线在今天是不行的：我们还要行手术呢。”
    “克拉错夫………”
    “克拉错夫有什么办法呢，克拉错夫是司机，而电气技师是你呀。你得留到这儿吧。”
    “我不留到这儿，你随便吧，”裴娜说。“我是前线上的人，是战场上的人，无论炸弹，无论炮弹，对我都没办法的。”
    达尼洛夫对她的吹牛，不由得微笑起来。
    “裴娜，我不能带你，司令派你到外科室的。”
    “我不能够，裴娜：司令叫你担任外科方面的工作呢。”
    “真鬼气！”裴娜说，“我真倒霉！你把我的药包拿去吧，小姐，”琳娜站在月台上，两手背在背后，仰着那男孩子似的头，裴娜对她说着。“把我的药包拿去吧，你这不要命的能干的人。”
    “医生，”达尼洛夫对苏普鲁戈夫说，“整个的欧洲都在看着我们呢。”
