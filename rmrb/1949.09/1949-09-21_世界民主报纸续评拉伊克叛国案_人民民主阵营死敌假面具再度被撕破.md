　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 20th: As the trial of the Rajk and his accomplices' espionage and treason case in Hungary is underway, the world's democratic newspapers continue to report the details of the trial and publish commentaries.
　　According to a TASS dispatch on the 18th, the Bulgarian "Workers' Cause" newspaper published a report from its special correspondent at the court, titled "Indisputable New Facts About Tito's Conspiracy Against the People's Democratic Countries." The "Fatherland Front" newspaper, under the titles "Rajk and Ranković's Secret Talks" and "Tito Conspires to Overthrow the Governments of the People's Democratic Countries to Restore Capitalism," reprinted foreign newspapers' and public comments on the trial being held in Budapest and its proceedings. The Albanian newspaper "People's Voice" stated that the trial in Budapest of a group of imperialist agents led by Rajk, servants of the Belgrade bourgeois nationalists, deadly enemies of their country's people and the socialist camp, once again tore off the masks of those criminals before the whole world. The newspaper further pointed out: Rajk and his gang, like Koci Xoxe and other imperialist agents who secretly infiltrated the People's Democratic countries in Albania, have had their evil plans thwarted thanks to the vigilance of the working people and their parties. They have been exposed, and they are paying for their actions against the freedom and independence of Hungary. The time is not far off when their protectors and organizers—the imperialists and the Tito clique—will be punished by their people.
　　The Israeli newspapers "Kol Haam," "Al-Hamishmar," and several other newspapers describing the Hungarian court proceedings, particularly emphasized that Rajk and Balfé had admitted that they engaged in espionage activities for the intelligence agencies of the Anglo-American and Tito cliques, and that they and Tito's fascist clique were jointly preparing conspiracies against the people's democratic system not only in Hungary but also in other people's democratic countries.

　　世界民主报纸续评拉伊克叛国案
  　人民民主阵营死敌假面具再度被撕破
    【新华社北平二十日电】当匈牙利拉伊克及其同谋的间谍叛国案正在审判之际，世界民主报纸继续报道这一案件审讯的详情，并纷纷发表评论。
    综合塔斯社十八日消息，保加利亚工人事业报刊登其特派记者自法庭发来的报道，题为“关于铁托阴谋反对人民民主国家的无可辩驳的新事实”。祖国阵线报在“拉伊克与兰科维奇的密谈”，“为了恢复资本主义，铁托阴谋推翻人民民主国家的政府”的标题下，转载外国报纸和公众关于现在布达佩斯举行的审讯及其进行情形的评论。阿尔巴尼亚“人民之声”报称，在布达佩斯举行的对以拉伊克为首的一批帝国主义代理人，贝尔格莱德资产阶级民族主义者的从仆、他们国家的人民和社会主义阵营的死敌的审讯，再度在全世界面前撕破了那些罪犯的假面具。该报进一步指出：拉伊克一伙象阿尔巴尼亚的科奇·霍克西及其他秘密混入人民民主国家的帝国主义代理人一样，由于劳动人民及其政党的警惕，他们的罪恶计划业已失败。他们被揭穿了，而且他们正在偿付他们反对匈国自由和独立的行动之罪债。他们的保护者、组织者——帝国主义者和铁托集团，被他们人民惩罚的时候，已为时不远了。
    以色列的“科尔·加姆”报、“阿尔·加米施马尔”报和若干其他描述匈牙利庭讯情形的报纸，均特别强调拉伊克和巴尔费已承认他们为英美和铁托集团的谍报机关从事间谍活动，他们和铁托的法西斯集团，不仅是在匈牙利，而且也在其他人民民主国家共同准备反人民民主制度的阴谋。
