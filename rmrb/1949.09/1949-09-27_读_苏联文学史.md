　　Reading "A History of Soviet Literature"
    By He Mu, written by Ji Mo Fei Ye Fu, translated by Shui Fu
    Soviet literature was introduced to China more than twenty years ago and played a significant role among Chinese intellectuals. However, there was no comprehensive work on the history of Soviet literature, which was a great regret for those who wanted to have a general understanding of Soviet literature. According to the translator, this book is the most systematic of all works on the history of Soviet literature. The author, Professor Timofeev, is an academician of the Soviet Academy of Sciences and one of the leading Soviet theorists of literature and art.
    Soviet literary activity is inseparable from the Soviet regime. Therefore, this book quotes the words of the History of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) when explaining each major event. The ideology of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) runs through the book like a red thread. Every important writer and every important work is explained and criticized very carefully.
    Gorky, as the founder of Soviet literature and the founder of proletarian literature worldwide, is the first writer narrated in this book. A total of two hundred pages are devoted to depicting the path taken by this giant. In addition, we also see how the outstanding Russian writers of the time—Bryusov, Blok, and others—transformed and stood with the people, and at the same time, we see how Andreyev, Bunin, Kuprin, and others embarked on the road to destruction—the road against the people.
    After the socialist revolution, Soviet literature, like all Soviet construction, developed rapidly, shocking the world. The most outstanding are Vladimir Mayakovsky, Alexei Tolstoy, Sholokhov, Fadeyev, Simonov, and others. In every period, the Soviet people always gave Soviet writers new creative themes. Similarly, in every period, Soviet writers also dedicated new era-defining works to the Soviet motherland. In the early days, there were works such as "Chapayev," "The Rout," and "The Twelve." During the construction period, there were "Cement," "Time, Forward!," "How the Steel Was Tempered," "Grain," and "Virgin Soil Upturned." During the Great Patriotic War, Soviet writers demonstrated their characteristics even more.
    Twenty percent of the members of the Soviet Writers' Union (accounting for eight hundred people) went to the front lines like the army. Three hundred Soviet writers received combat medals and awards. The blood of Soviet writers flowed together with the blood of Soviet soldiers who died on the battlefield. One hundred and forty writers did not return from the battlefield. The martyrdom of Yuri Krymov, the author of "The Tanker 'Derbent'," is an example. He fought bravely alongside the soldiers in the besieged position and finally sacrificed himself unyieldingly—with seven bayonet wounds inflicted on his chest by Nazi bandits. The works written by Soviet writers reflecting this great war include "Invasion," "The Front," "The Young Guard," "Days and Nights," "The Unvanquished," and "People Immortal." And now Soviet writers are fighting for mankind, fighting for lasting peace and democracy for mankind. Therefore, Stalin's statement that "Soviet writers are engineers of the human soul" is well-deserved.
    The Soviet Union has sixteen republics, including dozens of ethnic groups, and the cultures of all ethnic groups have the opportunity to be developed as much as possible. Many ethnic groups did not have their own literature in the past, but they have their own literature after the revolution. Many ethnic groups were prohibited from using their own scripts in the past, but they have their own writers after the revolution. Judging from the number of members of the Soviet Writers' Union, we can see that the cultures of all ethnic groups have the opportunity to be developed equally. There are approximately three thousand five hundred members, of which Russians account for one thousand five hundred, and other ethnic groups: Ukrainians three hundred, Georgians one hundred and seventy, Armenians one hundred... even the Adyghe people, with a population of only eighty-eight thousand, have their own writers' association.
    In "A History of Soviet Literature," we see not only the brilliant Soviet literature, but also recognize that only under the socialist system can the people's culture have such brilliant achievements.

　　读“苏联文学史”
    禾木  季莫菲叶夫著 水夫译
    苏联的文学在二十多年前已经被介绍到中国来，并且在中国的知识分子中起了很大的作用，但是关于苏联的文学史却没有一部较完备的著作，这对于企图对苏联文学有一个总的认识的人是一个很大的遗憾。本书据译者称是所有苏联文学史的著作中最有系统的一部。作者季莫菲叶夫教授是苏联学术院院士，有数的苏联文艺理论家之一。
    苏联的文学活动是与苏维埃政权分不开的，因此本书在说明每一件大事时便引用着联共（布）党史中的字句，联共思想象一根红线贯穿着本书。每一个重要的作家，每一部重要的著作都有非常仔细的说明和批判。
    作为苏联文学的创始人，作为全世界无产阶级文学的创始人的高尔基是本书所叙述的第一个作家。一共有二百页的篇幅都是描绘这个巨人所走的道路。此外我们也看到了当时俄罗斯的优秀作家——勃柳索夫、勃洛克等人怎样转变和人民站在一起，同时也看到了安德烈夫、蒲宁、库普林等人怎样走上死亡的道路——反人民的道路。
    在社会主义革命以后，苏联的文学也和苏联的一切建设一样，以震惊着全世界的快速往前发展。最杰出的有符拉其米尔、马雅可夫斯基、阿列克赛、托尔斯泰、萧洛霍夫、法捷耶夫、西蒙诺夫等人。在每一个时期苏联的人民总给苏联的作家以新的创作题材，同样，在每一个时期，苏联作家也献给苏维埃祖国以新的代表时代的作品。在初期有“夏伯阳”、“毁灭”、“十二个”等作品。在建设期中有“士敏土”、“时间呀，前进！”“钢铁是怎样炼成的”、“粮食”、“被开垦的处女地”等。在伟大的卫国战争中苏联的作家更表现了他们的特色。
    苏联作家协会的会员有百分之二十（占八百人）与军队同样走上战线。三百个苏维埃作家获得了战斗奖章和奖牌。苏维埃作家的血，与战场上捐躯的苏维埃战士的血，流在一起。一百四十个作家没有从战场上回来。“油船特宾特号”作者尤里·克雷尼夫的殉国是一个例子，他在被包围的阵地上和战士一同英勇应战，最后不屈牺牲——胸上给纳粹匪徒穿了七刺刀。苏联的作家所写的反映这个伟大战争的作品有“侵略”、“战线”、“青年近卫军”、“日日夜夜”、“不屈的人民”、“人民不朽”等。而现在苏联的作家又为人类在战斗，为争取人类的永久和平民主而战斗。因此，斯大林所说的“苏联的作家是人类灵魂的工程师”是名符其实的。
    苏联共有十六个共和国，包括几十个民族，各民族的文化都能得到尽量发展的机会。有许多民族过去没有自己的文学，革命后有了自己的文学。有许多民族过去自己的文字被禁止使用，革命后有自己的作家。以苏联作家协会的人数来看，我们就可以看出各民族的文化是得到同等发展的机会。会员大约有三千五百人，其中俄罗斯的占一千五百人，其他的各民族：乌克兰三百人，乔治亚一百七十人，亚美尼亚一百人………甚至人数只有八万八千人的民族阿德盖也有自己的作家协会。
    在“苏联文学史”中我们看到的不只是辉煌的苏联文学，而是认识了只有在社会主义的制度下，人民的文化才能有这样光辉的成就。
