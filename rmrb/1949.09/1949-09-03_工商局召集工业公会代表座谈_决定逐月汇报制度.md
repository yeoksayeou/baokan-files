The Industry and Commerce Bureau Convenes Symposium of Industry Association Representatives
　　Establishes Monthly Reporting System

[This Municipality News] The Municipal Industry and Commerce Bureau has completed its work on industrial registration. To further understand the production and sales situation of private industries in the city in a timely manner, to understand existing problems, and to strengthen guidance on production, after listening to oral reports from representatives of nineteen industry trade associations on August 20th, the Industry and Commerce Bureau convened another symposium of private industry trade association representatives on the 30th. At the meeting, a regular monthly reporting system was formally established. The reporting will be in written form, with each factory filling out a monthly production and sales report, which will be submitted to the respective trade associations to be compiled into a monthly industry production and sales report. The report includes major items such as: a comparison of monthly increases and decreases in the number of businesses, changes in power and machinery equipment production tools, and the status and total value of finished product production and sales. This monthly reporting system will start in August, and in line with the usual practice of factories settling accounts at the end of the month, the monthly report should be collected by the respective trade associations and sent to the Industry and Commerce Bureau before the 10th of the second month. The meeting unanimously agreed that this relatively scientific reporting system will enable the government to guide private industrial production policies more promptly, which will greatly help the restoration, transformation, and development of industry. All factories must fill out the reports in the spirit of "seeking truth from facts," and all trade associations must firmly adhere to and implement the system.
