　　Xinhua News Agency, Northwest Front, 6th. The People's Liberation Army liberated Xining, the capital of Qinghai Province, at noon on the 5th. After the elite main force of the Qing Ma bandit army suffered a devastating blow in the Lanzhou campaign, the remnants of that unit fled in a state of utter disarray towards the northwest. Officers and soldiers were in complete disarray, abandoning large amounts of firearms and ammunition along the way. When Xining was liberated, representatives of all ethnic groups in the city sent representatives to welcome the Liberation Army from afar. Prior to this, after liberating Lanzhou, the Liberation Army took advantage of the victory to cross the Yellow River and sweep westward with irresistible force. The Liberation Army pursuing towards the Gansu Corridor occupied Yongdeng County on the afternoon of the 3rd. The Liberation Army entering Qinghai Province successively captured Minhe, Hualong, and Xunhua from the 2nd to the 5th. The head of the Kuomintang Self-Defense Regiment in Ledu County led his troops to contact the Liberation Army for surrender on the morning of the 5th.

　　青海省会西宁解放
  　各族人民代表远道出城欢迎我军           
    陇青边境连克永登等四城
    【新华社西北前线六日电】人民解放军于五日中午解放青海省会西宁城。青马匪军精锐主力在兰州战役中受到歼灭性的打击之后，该部残匪即向西北方向狼狈逃窜，官兵溃乱不堪，沿途抛弃枪械弹药颇多。西宁解放时，该城各族人民曾派遣代表远道出城欢迎解放军。在此以前，解放军于解放兰州后乘胜渡过黄河，向西扫荡，势如破竹。向甘肃走廊追击之解放军于三日下午占领永登县城。进入青海省境的解放军，于二日至五日连克民和、化隆、循化三城。乐都县国民党自卫团团长于五日晨率部向解放军接洽投诚。
