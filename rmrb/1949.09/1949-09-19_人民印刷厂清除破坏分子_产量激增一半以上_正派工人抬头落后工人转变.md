　　People's Printing Factory Eliminates Saboteurs
  　Production Surges by More Than Half
    Upright Workers Stand Tall, Backward Workers Transform
    [Our Dispatch] Since the Beijing People's Printing Factory arrested the deeply hated saboteur An Qingyu, the workers feel as if a weight has been lifted, and the whole factory has taken on a new atmosphere, with production rapidly increasing. Wang Lianbao, a gravure worker, said, "In the past, our veteran workers had the ability but nowhere to use it. It seemed like the higher-ups didn't pay attention. Even if you wanted to print more, you didn't dare, fearing the mockery and intimidation from An Qingyu and his gang. Now, if you have the ability, you have a place to use it." Some backward workers who had followed An Qingyu and his group, such as Feng Rongsheng, Gao Baozhen, and Yang Ziyuan, realized that their past behavior had been deceived by conspiratorial saboteurs. They went to the trade union to express remorse and resolved to respond to the sabotage and division of the conspirators with redoubled efforts in production. Because upright workers stand tall, the production volume of each group in the factory has increased by an average of more than 50 percent. In the gravure section, each machine used to stop after printing only 8,000 sheets, and no one dared to print more. Now, some machines have printed more than 11,000 sheets, and each machine can save 20 to 30 pounds of ink per day. The collotype section's production statistics on the 13th showed an increase of 80 percent, with some individual machines even increasing by more than 100 percent. The output of various departments in the finishing section has also increased by more than 50 percent. On the other hand, the number of defective products has sharply decreased. A certain machine printed 32,000 sheets, and only 46 were defective (previously, the average defect rate was about 20 percent). Labor discipline has also greatly improved. The noisy phenomenon during work hours has disappeared, and there are no more instances of being late or leaving early. In the past, the gravure section would take a quarter of an hour to start the machines at the beginning of the shift, and even stop work an hour before the end of the shift. Now, they automatically arrive early for work and leave on time. Moreover, the night shift workers of a certain machine challenged other shifts, saying, "The white shift doesn't come, the night shift doesn't leave." The day shift workers also proposed "The white shift doesn't stop the machine for meals," and other shifts responded one after another, greatly increasing the enthusiasm for production.

　　人民印刷厂清除破坏分子
  　产量激增一半以上
    正派工人抬头落后工人转变
    【本报讯】北平中国人民印刷厂自从逮捕了人人痛恨的阴谋破坏分子安庆余后，工人觉得去了一块石头，全厂出现了新的气象，生产量迅速提高。西凹印工人王连宝说：“过去咱们股老工人有能耐也没地方使，上级好象也不注意，就是你想多印一点也不敢，怕安庆余那帮人来讥刺威吓，现在有本事可有地方使了。”过去随着安庆余他们走的一些落后工人如冯荣升、高宝珍、杨子元等，发觉他们以往的行为是受了阴谋破坏分子的欺骗，纷纷到工会表示悔过，并决心以加倍努力生产来回答阴谋分子的破坏分裂。由于正派工人抬头，全厂各股生产量平均提高了百分之五十以上。西凹每机过去只印到八千就停止了，谁也不敢多印，现在有的机子已印到一万一千多，而且每机每天还能省下油墨二十磅到三十磅。胶印股十三日统计产量已提高了百分之八十，有的个别机子甚至增加百分之百以上。完成股各部门产量也提高到百分之五十以上。另一方面是废品锐减，某号机印了三万二千张，只有四十六张是坏的（以往废品率平均要占百分之二十左右）。劳动纪律也大大改善。上班时吵吵闹闹的现象没有了，迟到早退的现象也没有了，过去凹印股上班时要一刻钟才开动机器，下班时甚至在一个钟头以前就停工了。现在他们自动提前上班，按时下班，而且某号机夜班全体工友向其他各班提出挑战：“白班不来，夜班不走”。日班工人也提出“白班不停机吃饭”，其他各班纷纷应战，生产情绪大大提高。
