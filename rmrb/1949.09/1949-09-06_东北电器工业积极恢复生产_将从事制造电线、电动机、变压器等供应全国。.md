Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, September 5th: The restoration and development of the Northeast electrical manufacturing industry, an important link in Northeast industrial construction, is gradually advancing. Currently, the six factories under the leadership of the Northeast Electrical Industry Bureau—Shenyang Wire, Electric Motor, Battery, Light Bulb, Radio Motor, and Fushun Electrical Porcelain factories—have resumed production after arduous repairs. According to the existing equipment and production capacity of each factory, they can manufacture electric motors below 50 horsepower, transformers below 50 kVA (kilovolt-amperes), various ordinary electric meters, electric lights, and other miscellaneous equipment. The Fushun Electrical Porcelain Factory, because it was received relatively intact, is now able to manufacture 66,000-volt high-voltage insulators, and its output has increased one and a half times compared to the puppet Manchurian period, which can supply half of the needs of Northeast and North China. The output of various products that have been restored to production in other factories is also gradually increasing. However, all these achievements are far from meeting the actual demand. Many factories and mines have already put forward electrical equipment demands that cannot be met temporarily. Therefore, the full restoration and further development of this industry is a matter of urgency.

During the puppet Manchurian period, in order to enhance the dependence of the Northeast electrical industry on it, the Japanese invaders not only did not allow the manufacture of basic motors such as generators in the Northeast, but even electric motors above 200 horsepower or electrical appliances with more complex and precise structures and basic electrical materials such as various insulating materials, had to be imported from Japan. Even those factories that were allowed to manufacture simple equipment were deprived of the ability to produce independently. The basic raw materials they needed, such as electric meters, yellow wax cloth, insulating paper, mica sheets, bakelite sheets, etc., all had to rely on Japan. When these factories were taken over by the People's Government from the Kuomintang last November, the mechanical equipment was only one-tenth of that during the puppet Manchurian period. After two months of emergency repairs, the electrical manufacturing factories in Shenyang, which had been completely shut down for a year, were quickly restored to production. At this time, the radio motor factory, which had been newly established in North Manchuria during the Liberation War, also moved here. In the beginning, due to lack of experience in technology and management, some unnecessary waste occurred in various factories. For example, the wire factory melted twelve furnaces of copper ingots that could not be drawn into wire, resulting in a loss of more than 30 million Northeast currency. Due to the lack of careful planning and necessary systems, the electrical factories alone wasted more than 20,000 man-hours in April. It was not until June of this year that the Northeast Administrative Committee officially established the Electrical Industry Bureau under the Ministry of Industry as the unified leading body for the Northeast electrical manufacturing industry, strengthening the restoration work of the industry. Currently, the bureau is leading the employees of various factories to formulate quota standards for quality, materials, personnel, time, etc., and to lay the foundation for economic accounting. At the same time, in order to strengthen the production organization of the industry, the Northeast People's Government is beginning to allocate machines to the bureau, add equipment, and has determined the policy of rapid restoration and gradual transformation to achieve independence and self-reliance. And due to the restoration of the Anshan steel industry, the problem of materials necessary for manufacturing transformers (silicon steel sheets) will be solved; electric meters, which used to be imported from Japan, can now be manufactured. Yellow wax cloth, ultra-high-voltage transformer porcelain bottles and other supplies needed in various places are also being actively trial-produced. The main tasks of the bureau at present, in addition to strengthening equipment in a planned manner, are to focus on the central links and engage in the production of electrical wires, electric motors, transformers, and a series of related electrical materials, in order to meet the urgent needs of industrial production in the Northeast and even the whole country. It is estimated that within two or three years, the industry can be fully restored and exceed the highest production level during the puppet Manchurian period.

　　东北电器工业积极恢复生产
    将从事制造电线、电动机、变压器等供应全国。
    【新华社沈阳五日电】作为东北工业建设中一个重要环节的东北电器制造工业的恢复和发展，正逐步推进中。目前在东北电气工业管理局领导下的沈阳电线、电机、蓄电池、灯炮、无线电机及抚顺电瓷等六个工厂，经过艰苦的修理，均已恢复生产。按各厂现有设备和生产能力，可以制造五十马力以下的电动机，五十千伏（特）安（培）以下的变压器，以及各种普通电表、电灯等与其他零星器材。抚顺电瓷厂因接收时比较完整，现已能制六万六千伏特的高压绝缘器，且产量较伪满时期提高了一倍半，可以供给东北、华北需要量的半数。其余各厂已恢复生产的各种产品产量，亦在逐步提高。但所有这些成绩，如与实际需要量比较，却是相差很远。有许多厂矿已经提出的电器需求，暂时还不能满足。因此这一工业的全部恢复与进一步的发展，实为急不容缓的事。
    伪满时期，日寇为了增强东北电器工业对它的依附性，不独不允许在东北制造发电机一类的基本电机，就是二百马力以上的电动机或构造较为精密复杂的电器及各种绝缘材料等基本电料，均需由日本国内输入。即允许存在的那些制造简单器材的工厂，也被剥夺了独立生产的能力，所需的基本原料，如电表、黄腊布、绝缘纸、云母板、胶木板等，都必需仰赖日本。这些工厂，当去年十一月人民政府从国民党手中接收过来时，机械设备已仅及伪满时期的十分之一。经过两个月的抢修，乃将全部停工一年之久的沈阳各电器制造工厂迅速恢复生产。这时在解放战争中新建立起来的无线电机工厂，亦从北满迁来。开始时，各厂由于技术和管理上缺乏经验，发生了一些不应有的浪费现象。如电线工厂，曾熔了十二炉不能拉线的铜块，损失达东北币三千万元以上。由于计划欠周密和缺乏必要的制度，仅四月份内，各电器工厂就浪费了两万余工时。直到今年六月东北行政委员会才于工业部之下正式成立了电气工业管理局，作为东北电器制造工业的统一领导机关，加强了该业的恢复工作。现该局正领导各厂员工，制订质量、材料、人员、时间等定额标准，奠定经济核算的基础。同时为加强该业的生产机构，东北人民政府正开始为该局调拨机器，增添设备，确定了迅速恢复和逐渐改造到能独立自主的方针。而由于鞍山钢铁业的恢复，制造变压器必需的材料（矽钢片）问题，将可获得解决；过去仰赖日本输入的电表，现在也可以制造了。各地所需要的黄腊布、超高压变电瓷瓶等用品，亦正在积极试制中。该局目前的主要工作除了有计划地加强设备外，并抓住中心环节，从事电线、电动机、变压器及与此相联系的一系列电气材料的生产，以满足东北以至全国工业生产的迫切需要。估计在二、三年内该业即可完全恢复并超过伪满时期的最高生产水平。
