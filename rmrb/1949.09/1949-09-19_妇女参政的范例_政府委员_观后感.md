　　A Model of Women's Participation in Politics
    ——Reflections on "Government Member"
    Xiao Nan
    Movies are powerful tools for ideological education. In particular, Soviet films can profoundly and meticulously introduce the construction of socialist countries and the noble qualities of Bolsheviks, clearly giving people a direction for their efforts.

    Although the women's issue has been fundamentally resolved with the victory of the Chinese revolution, in terms of ideology, most women, except for some liberated working women and revolutionary intellectual women, still do not fully understand their importance in society. The film "Government Member" gives us the following insights: (1) Learn from Praskovya's abundant fighting spirit: Her irresistible spirit of sacrificing everything and fighting bravely for the interests of the working class should be learned, especially by those women who value "gentle and graceful" beauty. We know that to live is to struggle, revolution is intensified struggle, and construction itself is also struggle. Without fighting spirit, one cannot better serve the people and the construction of the motherland. (2) Women achieve their status in the family through active labor and ideological progress: Praskovya deeply loves her husband, but when the collective farm work needs her more, she unhesitatingly refuses her husband's request for her to "stay at home," which results in her husband having to admit, "I can't keep up with you." This means that focusing on the interests of the majority and creating love in work is eternal. If one blindly clings to male tenderness, one will turn oneself into a dependent of life. Of course, men and women are not in an antagonistic relationship but help each other in the work of striving for human happiness. (3) Great spirit of learning: Praskovya tirelessly studies to fight for the interests of the masses because she constantly fights against backward rural ideas, fights against hooligans and loafers, and fights against all obstacles to work! At the same time, because the working people do not have their own intellectuals and are often hindered by that "agronomist," she is determined to arm herself with Marxism-Leninism and mobilize young people to go to the city to study. She opposed conservative traditional customs with "the people's resolution is the law" and created "workdays." She experienced in her practical work that it is necessary to unite the middle peasants, although some people misunderstood that she "has sympathy for the rich peasants," but because she had a correct stand and mastered the policies, her correct understanding was finally proven by the facts. She said: "I am not a party member, but my heart is with the Party." Yes, many of our labor heroes are produced in this way.

    We believe that only our own efforts can completely liberate ourselves. Praskovya tells us: "Lenin and Stalin have done the first half of the work for us, and our task in the future is to build houses, establish schools..." Then, we can answer Praskovya like this: "Mao Zedong has lifted the two thousand years of feudal rule for us, and our task in the future is to exert the strength of women even more in the cause of building a new China!"

　　妇女参政的范例
    ——“政府委员”观后感
    萧南
    电影是有力的思想教育工具，尤其是苏联影片更能深刻入微的介绍社会主义国家的建设及布尔塞维克的高尚品质，明确地给人以努力的方向。
    妇女问题虽然已经伴随着中国革命的胜利而获得基本上的解决，但在思想上，除了部分翻身的劳动妇女和革命的知识妇女外，大多数的妇女还是不太了解自己在社会上的重要性。“政府委员”这影片给了我们如下的几点启示：（一）学习三娘底充沛的战斗力：她那股子不可抗拒的不惜一切牺牲，英勇地为劳动阶级的利益而战斗的精神，对那些素以“淑婉窈窕”为美的妇女们是更应当学习的。我们知道，生存即是斗争，革命是尖锐化的斗争，建设本身也是斗争，缺乏战斗力是不会更好的为人民底祖国的建设效劳的。（二）用积极的劳动和思想进步取得了妇女在家庭的地位：三娘是挚爱丈夫的，但是为了集体农庄的工作更需要她，她毫不迟疑的拒绝了丈夫要她“留在家里”的要求，结果使她的丈夫不得不承认“我赶不上你”，这就是说把眼光放在多数人的利益上，在工作中创造的爱才是永恒的，如果一味贪恋男性的温情，那是会把自己变成生活的附属品的。当然，男女不是对立的关系，是在争取人类幸福的工作上彼此互助的。（三）伟大的学习精神：三娘为了争取群众的利益而不倦地进行学习，因为她经常的向农村的落后思想斗争，向流氓懒汉斗争，向一切工作的障碍斗争！同时，因为劳动人民没有自己的知识分子而时常受那位“农学家”的阻挠，所以她决心用马列主义武装起自己的头脑，并且动员青年到城里去学习，她以“人民的决议就是法律”反对了保守的传统习惯，而创造了“劳动日”。她在实际工作中体验到必须团结中农，虽然有人误解她“有同情富农的思想”但是由于她立场正确，掌握了政策，终于被事实证明了她的认识正确。她说：“我是非党员，但是我和党是一条心。”是的，我们不少的劳动英雄们就是这样产生的。
    我们相信只有自己的努力才可以彻底的解放自己。三娘告诉我们说：“列宁斯大林给我们做好了前半部的工作，今后我们的任务就是造房子，建立学校……”，那么，我们可以这样回答三娘：“毛泽东给我们解除了二千多年的封建统治，今后我们的任务是在建设新中国的事业中，更要发挥妇女的力量！”
