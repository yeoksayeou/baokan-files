Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, August 31st: Shanghai commodity prices, which have fluctuated three times since liberation, began to stabilize at the beginning of this month. For the past three weeks, the daily decline in wholesale prices of major commodities has generally been between 1% and 4%, with declines outnumbering increases. As of August 20th, 20-count Jincheng yarn had fallen by 4% compared to the end of last month, Dragon Head fine cloth by 6%, high-quality lump coal by 8.8%, locally produced raw oil by 21%, Battleship brand flour by 18.8%, and medium-white粳 rice by 31.6% (average price in both northern and southern markets). This is in stark contrast to the continuous sharp rise in prices in June and July. The most significant price increase in June and July was for rice, which rose four and a half times in June compared to May, and then another 110% in July, but rice has also seen the largest price drop this month. Another prominent phenomenon in the market is the gradual easing of credit. The daily interest rate on the market has fallen from 20 to 25 yuan per thousand yuan at the beginning of the month to 6 to 8 yuan. The interest rate posted by the Bankers Association has been adjusted three times this month, with the daily interest rate on loans falling from 25 yuan per thousand yuan to 16 yuan, the daily interest rate on deposits falling from 5.5 yuan to 3.5 yuan, and the daily interest rate among banks falling from 20 yuan to 12 yuan. This is very different from the past, when prices would fall slightly when credit was tight, and prices would rise when credit eased.

　　Expanded Urban-Rural Trade Ensures Smooth Grain Supply

The reason for the price decline is primarily that the People's Government has strengthened the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas, and has smoothed the flow of grain. Taking rice as an example, the total supply of rice in Shanghai from January to March this year was 1.9 million shi, but imports accounted for 470,000 shi. Due to the blockade by imperialists and the Kuomintang reactionaries, the heavy rains in early July and the floods along the Yangtze River, and because it was the period between harvests, the grain supply was not smooth, which caused the sharp rise in grain prices in June and July. However, the People's Government has now solved this problem with its own strength. The correct grain price policy of the state-owned Shanghai Trading Corporation has gradually increased the amount of rice brought to the Shanghai market by merchants. In addition, the large amount of grain support from various liberated areas has enabled Shanghai to safely pass through the most difficult period of grain supply. Now, new grains from production areas near and far have been successively entering the market, and the period between harvests can be said to have passed. The floods along the Yangtze River were not as serious as expected. Therefore, since this month, rice prices have gradually fallen, and general commodity prices have also stabilized.

　　Outlawing Silver Dollar Circulation and Strictly Managing the Market

Another major reason is that the People's Government resolutely cracked down on speculators and strengthened management and leadership of the market. The silver dollar speculation in early June was cracked down by destroying the speculative center and arresting the main merchants, which meant that the gold, silver and silver dollar market lost its ability to control prices. Then, the People's Bank posted prices to redeem silver dollars, launched inflation-proof savings deposits, carried out key rice allocations, and coordinated with a widespread publicity campaign against the use of silver dollars, so that prices gradually fell back from the peak of June 10, stabilizing for about ten days. In late June, the second wave of fluctuations started, and the People's Government used the method of tightening currency to ease it. In the third wave of fluctuations in mid-July, in addition to the state-owned grain company supplying rice at low prices without restriction, the People's Government uniformly set the trading hours for six markets, including grain and cotton cloth, and implemented a same-day delivery system in the rice, flour, and miscellaneous grain markets, banning futures, warehouse receipt transactions, and restricting withdrawal behavior. From July 30th, a negotiated price method was implemented in the rice market to prevent price gouging. In addition, the People's Government vigorously implemented thrift, reduced fiscal expenditures, and reasonably controlled the issuance of currency, and the market was calm, making hoarding and speculation unprofitable. Citizens also began to change their mentality of valuing goods over currency, and deposits in the credit unions increased sharply, thus forming the current good phenomenon of loose credit and stable prices. The current problem is how to open up the sales of industrial products so that they can reach a reasonable exchange rate with agricultural products such as grain and raw materials.

　　Because the Liberation War is still going on and transportation is still difficult, the current state of price stability must be maintained with various efforts. However, the most difficult period of rice supply has passed, and opportunities for speculation have been largely eliminated. It is estimated that major price fluctuations can be avoided in the future.

### 沪物价转入平稳　青黄不接时期已过投机空隙大体杜绝

　　沪物价转入平稳
  　青黄不接时期已过投机空隙大体杜绝
    【新华社上海三十一日电】解放以来曾三度波动的上海物价，本月初已开始转入平稳状态。三周以来，主要商品趸售价格的逐日跌落幅度，一般总在百分之一至四之间，且跌多于涨。到八月二十日为止，二十支金城纱较上月底跌百分之四，龙头细布跌百分之六，上等烟煤块跌百分之八点八，本厂生油跌百分之二十一，兵船面粉跌百分之十八点八，中白粳跌百分之三十一点六（南北市场平均价）。这与六七月份的物价不断猛涨，恰成显明对照。六七月份涨得最厉害的是食米，六月份曾较五月份涨了四倍半，七月份又涨了百分之一百一十，但本月以来也就是食米跌得最多。市场上另一个突出现象是银根逐步松动了，市场日拆由月初的每千元二十至二十五元减到六至八元，银钱业公会利率牌价，本月以来已三度调整，放款日拆由每千元二十五元减到十六元，存款日息由五元五角减到三元五角，同业日拆由二十元减到十二元。这和过去银根紧时物价小跌，银根转松物价就涨的现象，大不相同。
    城乡贸易开展粮食来源畅旺
    物价下跌的原因，首先是因为人民政府加强城乡物资交流，疏导粮源。以食米为例，上海食米总供应量，今年一月至三月为一百九十万石，但由国外输入的就占了四十七万石。由于帝国主义和国民党反动派的封锁，由于七月初连日大雨和沿江水灾，也由于那时正处于青黄不接，粮源不畅，故造成六七月粮价猛涨的现象。但现在人民政府已以自己的力量解决了这个问题，国营上海贸易总公司正确的粮价政策，使商人运来上海市场的食米，逐渐增加。加上各解放区的大量粮食增援，就使上海安稳渡过了粮食供应的最困难时期。现在远近产区的新谷已陆续登场，青黄不接时期可说已经过去了，长江沿岸的水灾又不如预想的严重，因此自本月起，米价便逐渐下跌，一般物价也跟着转入了平稳状态。
    取缔银元流通严格市场管理
    另一个主要原因，是人民政府坚决打击投机商人和加强对市场的管理和领导。六月初旬的银元投机，被用破坏投机中枢、逮捕首要奸商的办法打击下去，从此便使金银银元市场失去了左右物价的地位。接着人民银行挂牌收兑银元，举办折实储蓄，进行重点配米，再配合以广泛的拒用银元的宣传运动，使物价由六月十日的高峰逐步回跌，平稳了十来天。六月下旬第二次波动起来，人民政府用收缩通货的办法使其趋于缓和。在七月中旬的第三次波动中，除了国营粮食公司以低价无限制供应食米之外，人民政府更统一划定了粮食、纱布等六个市场的交易时间，在米面杂粮市场实行当天交割制度，取缔期货、栈单交易限制退交行为。七月三十日起更在食米市场实行议价办法，防止哄抬物价。加上人民政府厉行节约，减少财政开支和合理控制通货的发行，市场风平浪静，使囤积居奇无利可图。市民也开始转变重货轻币的心理，行庄存款激增，因而形成目前银根松弛，物价平稳的好现象。现在的问题是如何打开工业品的销路，使其能与粮食、原料等农产品达到合理的交换比率。
    由于解放战争尚在进行，交通运输尚有困难，目前物价的平稳状态，还必须以各种努力，才能使之继续保持。但食米供应的最困艰时期已经过去，投机空隙已大体杜绝，估计今后可能避免较大幅度的物价波动。
