Xinhua News Agency, Northwest Front, 7th. After the People's Liberation Army liberated vast areas of southern Gansu, Tibetan and Hui people on the border between Gansu and Qinghai provinces specially sent representatives to express their regards and request the People's Liberation Army to advance rapidly into the area. On August 31st, the Tibetan Mowa Banner first sent a delegation of seven people headed by Wu Zhengang, representing 80,000 Tibetans, carrying a welcome letter and a proclamation from the China Anti-Japanese National Salvation Army First Route Headquarters, appointed by the Military Committee of the Chinese Soviet Republic in 1936, which had been treasured by the local Tibetan people for a long time. They came from 200 miles away to request the Liberation Army to quickly advance into the area and liberate the Tibetans in suffering. On the 1st of this month, Huang Zhengkui and Zhang Ziyi, representatives of the Jiamuyang Living Buddha of Labrang Monastery, and Han Zhihua, representative of the local Tibetans, and Su Guoren, representative of the Hui people, jointly arrived at the PLA garrison. General Wang Zhen, commander of a certain corps of the People's Liberation Army, personally received the representatives and expressed deep concern and sympathy for the painful lives of all ethnic groups who had fallen under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang after the Red Army's Long March northward and eastward to resist Japan fourteen years ago. He asked the representatives to call on the Han, Hui, and Tibetan people on the border of Gansu and Qinghai to unite and fight for the complete elimination of the common enemy, the Kuomintang reactionaries and the remnants of the Ma Bufang and Ma Hongkui bandit gangs. During their stay, the Tibetan representatives translated the eight-point code of conduct promulgated by the headquarters of the People's Liberation Army into Tibetan in one day and night, and immediately printed more than 500 copies, ready to take back to the Tibetan area for distribution and posting. The delegation returned to their hometown on the 3rd after completing their mission, earnestly expressing their willingness to work under the leadership of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu for the liberation of all Tibetan people and all ethnic groups in China. General Wang Zhen specially presented the delegation with portraits of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu as souvenirs. (Attached picture)
