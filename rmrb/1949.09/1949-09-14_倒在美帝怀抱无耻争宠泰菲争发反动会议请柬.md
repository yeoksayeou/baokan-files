　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 11th: The development and strengthening of the revolutionary forces of the people of Southeast Asia have intensified the struggle among the reactionary parties of Southeast Asian countries for the leadership of the counter-revolution. The spokesperson of the Thai Luang Phibunsongkhram government's Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced on August 6th that Thai Prime Minister Luang Phibunsongkhram had issued invitations to India, Burma, and the Philippines, inviting the leaders of the three governments to convene in Bangkok in November to discuss the political, cultural, and economic problems of Southeast Asia. The Thai Ministry of Foreign Affairs also announced that India had informally expressed its willingness to participate in the Bangkok Four-Nation Conference. Because Nehru will visit the United States in October, the conference cannot be held before November. This action by the Luang Phibunsongkhram government has provoked fierce attacks from Philippine newspapers. Philippine Undersecretary of Foreign Affairs Neri, when receiving reporters on the 7th, refused to answer whether the Philippines was prepared to participate in the Bangkok conference, while at the same time declaring that Philippine representative to the United Nations, Romulo's, contacts with representatives of Southeast Asian countries at Lake Success had "achieved satisfactory progress." According to Agence France-Presse Manila, citing so-called Philippine authoritative sources: "Romulo has issued invitations to possible member states of the Southeast Asian League," requesting them to send representatives to the Baguio Conference, "possibly at the end of January next year." Thus, due to the confrontational measures taken by the reactionary parties of Thailand and the Philippines to please their masters, the reactionary governments of Southeast Asian countries will simultaneously receive two invitations: one for the Bangkok Conference and one for the Baguio Conference.

　　倒在美帝怀抱无耻争宠泰菲争发反动会议请柬
    【新华社北平十一日电】东南亚洲人民革命力量的发展加强了东南亚各国反动派争夺反革命领导权的斗争。泰国銮披汶政府的外交部发言人，于八月六日宣布：泰总理銮披汶已向印度、缅甸、菲律宾发出请柬，邀请三国政府领袖于十一月集会曼谷，以讨论东南亚的政治、文化及经济问题。泰国外交部又宣布印度已非正式地表示愿意参加曼谷四国会议。由于尼赫鲁将于十月间访美，因此会议无法在十一月以前举行。銮披汶政府这一行动，引起了菲律宾报纸的激烈攻击。菲外次尼奈七日在招待记者时，一面拒绝答复菲律宾是否准备参加曼谷会议的问题，一面扬言菲驻联合国代表罗慕洛在成功湖与东南亚各国代表的接触，已“获得满意的进展”。据法新社马尼拉九日电引所谓菲律宾权威人士透露：“罗慕洛已向东南亚联盟的可能成员国发出请柬”，要求它们派遣代表参加碧瑶会议，“日期或许在明年一月底”。这样，由于泰、菲两国反动派为讨好其主子而采取的对抗措施，东南亚各国的反动政府，就将同时收到曼谷会议与碧瑶会议的两个请柬。
