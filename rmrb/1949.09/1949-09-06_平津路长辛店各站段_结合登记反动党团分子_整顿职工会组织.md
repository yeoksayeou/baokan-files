Pingjin Railway's Changxindian Stations and Sections
	Rectifying Trade Union Organizations in Conjunction with Registering Reactionary Party and League Elements
[Reported by this newspaper] The Changxindian stations and sections of the Pingjin Railway Administration, in conjunction with the work of registering reactionary party and league elements, are transforming trade union organizations. Since the railway trade union in this area put forward the idea of changing its style, going deep into the lower levels, and leading production with production in July, it has gradually strengthened the connection between leaders and the masses. It was discovered that the composition of trade union organizations in many stations and sections was complex and that the masses were dissatisfied. Among the twenty-nine members of the seven trade unions in the electric repair plant, locomotive depot, and inspection station, etc., less than a quarter were truly active elements supported by the masses, and some were completely controlled by reactionary elements. This immediately aroused the attention of the leadership, and a stronger force was organized to carry out the work of transforming the trade unions, starting with the electric repair plant, where destructive activities were the most serious. At first, the workers were unwilling to reflect the truth, fearing that our approach would not satisfy their wishes. Later, the leaders explained in detail and seized on the characteristics of the plant having many young people, starting with mobilizing the youth to promote the ongoing registration of reactionary party and league elements, and launching a movement to expose reactionary elements in the trade union organization. In this way, reactionary elements Xia Zhixiang and another who manipulated the trade union, attacked the administration, and sabotaged production, were exposed and isolated, and were removed from their trade union work and expelled from membership. Afterwards, democratic elections continued to be held, and the workers were satisfied. Old worker Zhang Liyuan, who had never spoken before, excitedly pointed to the newly elected trade union member and said, "The ballot I cast, the one on it is exactly you!" Not only was the trade union transformed and the registration of reactionary party and league elements completed, but also thirteen young league members were developed from the movement. Subsequently, the experience gained was flexibly applied to other stations and sections. As of the end of August, trade unions in six units, including the engineering section and locomotive section, had been rectified. Among the thirty-two newly elected members, members of the Communist Youth League and active elements among the masses accounted for nine-tenths, and the appearance of the trade union organization was also renewed.

　　平津路长辛店各站段
  　结合登记反动党团分子
  　整顿职工会组织
    【本报讯】平津铁路管理局长辛店各站段，结合登记反动党团分子工作，改造职工会组织。该地区铁路职工会从七月提出转变作风，深入下层，以生产领导生产后，逐渐密切了领导与群众的联系；发现不少站段职工组织，成份复杂，为群众所不满。电修厂、机务段、检车所等七个职工会二十九个委员中，真正群众拥护的积极分子不及四分之一，有的则完全为反动分子所把持。当即引起领导上的重视，乃组织较强的力量，从破坏活动最甚的电修厂开始，进行改造职工会工作。起初，工友不肯反映真情，怕我们的做法不能满足他们的心意。以后领导上详加解释，并抓住该厂青年多的特点，从发动青年推动正在进行的反动党团分子登记工作入手，展开检举职工会组织中的反动分子运动；这样，操纵工会，打击行政，破坏生产的反动分子夏致祥二人，便被揭发和孤立起来，并被撤销其工会工作，开除会籍。以后继续进行民主选举，职工均感满意。一向不发言的老工友张立元，也兴奋地指着新当选的工会委员说：“我投的票，上面正是你们！”不但改造了工会，完成了反动党团分子登记，又从运动中发展了十三个青年团员。继又将取得的经验，灵活运用到其他站段。至八月底，已有工务段、机务段等六个单位职工会进行了整顿。在新当选的三十二个委员中，团员和群众中的积极分子占十分之九，工会组织面貌亦为之一新。　　　　　　　　　　（军）
