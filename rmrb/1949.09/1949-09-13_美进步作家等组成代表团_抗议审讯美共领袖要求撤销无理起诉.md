Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 12th: TASS, New York—On September 8th, during a recess in the trial of US Communist leaders, a delegation of more than one hundred progressive writers, artists, and actors presented a strong petition to the judge and prosecutor, demanding the dismissal of the charges against the US Communist leaders, on the grounds that the violence in Peekskill last week was caused by the US government's persecution of the Communist leadership. The petition stated: "The events in Peekskill are the result of a nationwide terror and hysteria movement centered on the Federal Court in Foley Square, New York. The leaders of the Communist Party—a legal political party—are on trial here, accused of propagating and advocating beliefs that the Department of Justice wants to condemn as 'guilty' and suppress. From the notion that this century-old philosophy is 'guilty' has sprung a series of persecutions, dismissals, book burnings, searches, and acts of violence against all Americans who firmly defend their rights. In essence, the entire United States has become one big Peekskill. At the opening of the court on September 8th, the defendants' defense lawyers submitted documents as part of a formal application for a mistrial. However, Medina refused to accept the defendants' application, refused to declare a mistrial, and advised the defendants to request other federal judges to order an investigation into the Peekskill incident.

　  抗议审讯美共领袖要求撤销无理起诉
    【新华社北平十二日电】塔斯社纽约讯：九月八日，在审讯美共领袖的法庭休庭时，一百多名进步的作家、艺术家和演员的代表团，向法官及检察官提出强硬的请愿书，要求撤消对于美共领袖的起诉，理由是：上周在毕克斯吉尔发生的暴行，是因美国政府迫害共产党领导机构所引起的。该请愿书宣称：“在毕克斯吉尔发生的事件，是以纽约波利广场联邦法院为中心的全国范围的恐怖和歇斯底里运动的结果。共产党——合法的政党——的领袖正在此间受审讯，罪名是宣扬和倡导司法部希望判为‘有罪’而加以扑灭的信仰。从这个已有一世纪历史的哲学是‘有罪’的观念中，产生了一连串的迫害、解雇、焚书、侦缉和对所有坚决保卫他们权利的美国人施用的暴行。实质上整个美国已经变成了一个大毕克斯吉尔了。在九月八日开庭时，被告辩护律师呈交证件，这些证件是作为由请宣布误审的正式申请书的一部分而提出的。但麦迪纳拒绝接受被告的申请，拒绝宣布误审，并劝令被告请求其他联邦法官下令调查毕克斯吉尔事件。
