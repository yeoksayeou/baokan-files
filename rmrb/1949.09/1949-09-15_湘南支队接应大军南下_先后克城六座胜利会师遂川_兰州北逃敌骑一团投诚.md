[Broadcast by Beiping Xinhua Broadcasting Station] News from the Xianggan Front, delayed until the 14th: The Xiangnan Detachment, which has been persisting in fighting behind enemy lines, victoriously joined forces with the People's Liberation Army's southward advancing main force in Suichuan County, Jiangxi Province, on August 13th. They were warmly welcomed by the southward advancing brothers of the PLA. The Xiangnan Detachment was formed in January of this year. After eight months of arduous struggle in the Xianggan area, it has grown nearly a hundredfold. This time, in welcoming the southward advance of the Liberation Army, it successively liberated six county towns, including Rucheng, Zixing, Yongxing, Guidong, Lingxian, and Chenxian, and vast rural areas, and won over more than 500 Kuomintang soldiers to revolt.

[Xinhua News Agency, Northwest Front, 14th] The entire regiment of cavalry of the 191st Division of the Kuomintang 91st Army, numbering over 800 men, which had fled from Lanzhou to Dajingpu, north of Yongdeng, under the leadership of Regiment Commander Qu Yixing and Deputy Regiment Commander Wang Shouzhen, surrendered to the Liberation Army with all their weapons on the 11th of this month. They were welcomed by the Liberation Army stationed there. The regiment has now been reorganized into the Cavalry Regiment of the 9th Army of the First Field Army of the People's Liberation Army, with the original regimental commander and deputy regimental commander remaining in their posts.
