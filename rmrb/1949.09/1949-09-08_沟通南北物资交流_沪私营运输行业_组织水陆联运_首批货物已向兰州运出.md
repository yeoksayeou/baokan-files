Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 7th: To facilitate the exchange of materials between North and South, Shanghai's private United Industry Water and Land Transportation Company, Xinghua Steamship Bureau, Huaxing Transportation Customs Brokerage, and other organizations are actively organizing combined water and land transport. This involves loading goods in Shanghai, transporting them by water to Huaiyin, then transferring them by truck or small boat to Xuzhou, connecting with the Jinpu and Longhai Railways for direct transport to Jinan, Tianjin, Haizhou, Kaifeng, Zhengzhou, and other places. From Zhengzhou, trucks and large carts then carry the goods to Xi'an, Lanzhou, and other destinations. The first batch of goods from Shanghai to Lanzhou has already been shipped from Zhengzhou and is expected to arrive in about half a month, barring any delays along the way. Some private shipping merchants have also opened routes from Shanghai to Bengbu. As of August 25th, six private steamers and motor vessels, including Tongrong, Tongsheng, Tongda, and Jiangyong, had arrived in Bengbu, with a typical journey time of twelve days. Currently, goods exported from Shanghai include cotton yarn, cloth, silk, general merchandise, electrical materials, ink, Western medicine, sacks, machinery, tires, parts, tarpaulins, and handbags, while imports mainly consist of soybeans, coarse grains, and coal.

Another report: To centrally manage and uniformly allocate ships, ensuring the supply of grain and coal to Shanghai and supporting the front lines, the Shanghai Shipping Office established a Ship Allocation Center on the 2nd. It was decided that passenger and cargo ships, tugboats, iron barges, motorized junks, and wooden boats must register with the Ship Allocation Center and undertake the transportation tasks assigned by the center.
