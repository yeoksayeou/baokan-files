[Report from this Newspaper] The city's middle school politics teachers' study symposium concluded on August 31st. The study symposium began on August 29th. Over the three days, more than a hundred politics teachers reviewed their work summaries from the previous semester, clarified the guiding principles of ideological and political education, exchanged teaching experiences and methods, and enhanced their ideological understanding. Group discussions were lively and substantial. Liu, the director of the Education Bureau, elaborated on the guiding principles of ideological and political education. Xu Liqun, the director of the Communist Youth League's Beijing Municipal Committee, and Xiang Ziming, of the School Branch Section of the Municipal Party Committee's Organization Department, delivered speeches. In his two reports, Director Liu pointed out that the fundamental task of ideological education must be accomplished through all educational activities, both inside and outside the classroom. All teachers, across all subjects, bear a certain responsibility for ideological education; it is not limited to the politics course alone. The establishment of a specialized politics course in middle schools is a characteristic of the transitional period, designed to meet the needs of newly liberated areas. If the general ideological and political understanding of school teachers improves, especially that of teachers of Chinese language, history, and geography, the current methods of political education should be changed. This is because the current methods can easily lead to dogmatic teaching methods. Director Liu specifically emphasized the appropriate coordination of the politics course with other subjects and students' extracurricular and off-campus activities.

In reviewing their work summaries from the previous semester, the politics teachers also confirmed that the politics course must be linked to other subjects and students' extracurricular activities, and combined with students' actual ideological circumstances to guide their lives and social activities, in order to fulfill the mission of the politics course.

In applying this principle during the last semester, the politics teachers generally achieved positive results. They influenced students through their daily lives, integrated themselves with the students, and established rapport through various means, understanding and grasping their ideological circumstances. For example, the politics teacher at Chongci Girls' Middle School made every effort to participate in extracurricular activities with the students, such as playing games, producing wall newspapers, attending lectures, and watching educational films. The students, in turn, felt that the politics teacher was approachable and dared to openly express their thoughts. As a result, the teacher was able to carry out ideological education more effectively. The politics teacher at the Municipal Commercial High School constantly collected students' reactions to the politics course, group discussions, various discussion meetings, lectures, forums, recreational activities, and various movements, so as to understand their ideological circumstances, their changing processes, and their demands, before deciding on the specific content of the lectures.

In mass movements, the politics teachers also implemented the spirit of combining political and ideological education with mass work. For example, when a general atmosphere of laxity and disorder prevailed in various middle schools in the city, the Municipal No. 2 Boys' Middle School, through the "May 1st" and "May 4th" commemorative days, with the politics teacher cooperating with the school administration, called for strengthened study. Combined with the situation of the People's Liberation Army's victorious crossing of the Yangtze River, they proposed that students should strengthen the study of current events. In this way, a climate of valuing classroom learning was gradually established, overcoming the students' restless mood since liberation. In addition, during the work of rectifying relief funds, the end-of-semester review movement, and the rectification of school order in private schools, most politics teachers were able to use all opportunities to educate the students and achieved considerable results.

The politics teachers also emphasized that classroom teaching must be combined with extracurricular group study. Last semester, many schools neglected the importance of extracurricular group study, while others achieved little success due to a lack of methods and experience in organizing group study. However, according to the experience of Youzhen Girls' Middle School, after the establishment of study groups in each class, students raised questions that they were unwilling to raise in class. They felt great interest in the teaching method of issuing outlines before class, introducing reference books, raising questions in group discussions, and then having the teacher give a summary report and answer questions in class. For teachers, this made it possible to better apply new teaching methods and prepare lively and practical teaching content based on students' reactions, avoiding the problem of dogmatism.

　　全市中学政治教员座谈
  　研讨中学政治教育
  　认为必须与其他学科以及课内外活动结合，与群众性的运动结合。
    【本报讯】本市中等学校政治教员学习座谈会，已于八月三十一日结束。学习座谈会自八月二十九日开始，三天中百余名政治教员检讨了上学期的工作总结，明确了思想政治教育方针，交流了教学经验和教学方法，提高了教员们的思想水准，小组讨论热烈充实。教育局柳＠局长作了思想政治教育方针的阐述，青年团北平市团委会主任许立群和市委组织部学校支部科项子明作了讲话。柳局长在两次报告中指明：思想教育的基本任务必须在课内课外全部教育活动中完成，一切教师，各种科目，都负有一定的思想教育任务，不是说单只政治课如此。在中学中政治课设成专课，它带有过渡期间的性质，这是适应新解放地区的要求的。如果学校教师一般思想政治水准提高，尤其是国文、史地教师的水准提高后，目前的政治教育方法就应改变。因为象目前的方法，容易形成教条主义的教学法。柳局长特别指出政治课等和其他各科及学生课外、校外活动要适当的配合。
    政治教员在检讨上学期工作总结时，也证实了政治课必须和其他学科、学生课外活动联系起来，结合同学的实际思想情况来指导生活并指导社会活动，以完成政治课的任务。
    上学期政治教员们在运用这一原则上，一般的是有成绩的。他们从生活上去影响学生，与学生打成一片，通过各种方式去建立感情，了解并掌握他们的思想情况。例如崇慈女中的政治教员尽量争取在课外活动方面和学生在一起玩、一起编壁报、一起去听讲演、一起去看有教育意义的电影；学生们则处处感到政治教员可亲，敢于大胆暴露自己的思想。因此，教员能够更有效地进行思想教育。市立高商的政治教员随时随地收集同学对政治课、小组讨论、各种讨论会、演讲会、座谈会、游艺会及各种运动的反应，以便在了解了他们的思想情况及其变化过程和要求之后，再决定讲课的具体内容。
    在群众性的运动中，政治教员也贯彻了政治思想教育和群众工作相结合的精神。如平市各中学普遍呈现散漫无秩序的现象时，市立男二中通过“五一”、“五四”两个纪念日，政治教员配合学校行政方面号召加强学习。并结合着解放军胜利渡江的形势，提出学生应加强学习时事的号召。这样，逐渐建立起重视课堂学习的风气，克服了从解放以来学生们浮躁不安的情绪。另外，在整顿救济金工作中，在学期终了的温书运动中，在私立学校整顿学校秩序中，大部分政治教员都能利用所有机会向学生进行教育。并获得相当的成绩。
    政治教员们还强调提出课堂教学必须与课外小组学习结合。上学期不少学校忽视了课外小组学习的重要性，有的学校则由于对怎样组织小组学习的方法和经验不足，而作得没有什么成绩。但据佑贞女中的经验，当各班的学习小组成立后，同学们不愿在班上提出的问题纷纷提出了，她们对于在上课前发下提纲、介绍参考书、小组讨论提出问题，然后先生上课作总结报告、解答问题的教学方法都感到很大的兴趣。对于教员来说，这样才能够更好地应用新的教学方法，可以根据学生们的反应来准备生动的切合实际的教学内容，才能避免教条主义的毛病。
