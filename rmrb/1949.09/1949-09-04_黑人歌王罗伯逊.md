Black Singer Paul Robeson

The black singer Paul Robeson is not only a singer warmly welcomed by the progressive people of the United States; he has also been most enthusiastically welcomed by audiences when he sang in the Soviet Union, France, Czechoslovakia, Sweden, and other countries. Robeson has become a world-renowned singer loved by progressive people around the world because he has dedicated his extraordinary art to the cause of fighting against imperialism, war-mongers, and racial discrimination.

Robeson once said: "For me, a song is a weapon with social significance. I don't think an artist can stand outside of politics. I stand on the side of the people." This has determined the direction of Robeson's creation and singing.

At the Paris World Congress of Supporters of Peace, Robeson said: "I represent democratic America, the black residents of America, and the colonial people who are fighting for the struggle for liberation against the new war-mongers, and I pay tribute to the Congress." The representatives of the Congress welcomed the speech of this anti-fascist, anti-imperialist singer with thunderous applause.

The reactionary American government has always hated the singing of the people's singer. Robeson himself said: "Out of the eighty-nine concerts I was going to hold, eighty-six were banned." On the one hand, there is the direct persecution and obstruction of the reactionary American government, and on the other hand, the American music venues are controlled by wealthy bosses who desperately raise ticket prices, so that ordinary people cannot attend the concerts. But all this could not stop Robeson's singing. On the contrary, he became more heroic. Not long ago, he spent two months singing for the workers free of charge.

After attending the Paris World Congress of Supporters of Peace, Robeson went to Moscow to sing. He loves the Soviet Union, he is a true and reliable friend of the Soviet Union, and every concert he held in Moscow was greeted with the warmest welcome from the audience.

Robeson is a singer of the world. He sings black folk songs, songs popular among the working people of various countries, Soviet classical music and modern masterpieces. He often sings the Chinese "March of the Volunteers" and the song of the Spanish Republican fighters. His singing is full of the strong will to fight, and his singing is a true battle call to progressive mankind all over the world.

　　黑人歌王罗伯逊
    黑人歌唱家罗伯逊，不仅是美国进步人民热烈欢迎的歌手；他在苏联、法国、捷克、瑞典等国演唱时，也都受到听众的最热情的欢迎。罗伯逊之成为驰名世界的为世界进步人民所热爱的歌唱家，是因为他把自己的非凡的艺术献给了反对帝国主义、反对战争贩子、反对种族歧视的斗争事业上。
    罗伯逊曾经说过：“对于我，歌曲是一种具有社会意义的武器。我不认为艺术家可以置身于政治之外。我是站在人民的一方面。”这就确定了罗伯逊的创作与演唱的方向。
    在巴黎世界拥护和平大会上，罗伯逊说：“我代表民主的美国，美国黑人居民和为自由的生活反对新战争贩子的解放斗争而奋斗的殖民地人民向大会致敬”。大会代表以雷动掌声欢迎这位反法西斯、反帝国主义歌手的发言。
    美国反动政府一向仇视人民的歌手的演唱。罗伯逊自己说：“在我所要举行的八十九次的音乐会中，有八十六次是被禁止的”。一方面是美国反动政府的直接的迫害阻挠，另一方面是美国的音乐场所都掌握在有钱的老板手里，他们拼命抬高入场券价格，使普通人民不能参加音乐会。但是这一切都不能阻止罗伯逊的歌唱，相反的他更英勇了，不久前，他曾用两个月的时间，为工人们进行了免收门票的歌唱。
    出席巴黎世界拥护和平大会之后，罗伯逊曾到莫斯科歌唱。他热爱苏联，他是苏联真实可靠的友人，他在莫斯科所举行的每一次演唱都受到听众最热烈的欢迎。
    罗伯逊是一个世界的歌唱家，他所唱的是黑人的民间歌曲，各国劳动人民中流行的歌曲，苏联的古典乐曲和近代名作，他常常唱中国的“义勇军进行曲”，西班牙共和国战士之歌，他的歌声里充满了斗争的坚强意志，他的歌声也就是对全世界进步人类发出的真实的战斗的号召。
