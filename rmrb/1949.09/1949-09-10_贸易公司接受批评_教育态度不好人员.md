　　Trading Company Accepts Criticism
    Educates Personnel with Poor Attitudes
    Editor:
    I am a student. During the summer vacation, to supplement my family's income, I learned the craft of knitting socks. One day, I took my finished products (socks) to the Beiping Trading Company (No. 1, Tizi Hutong, Wangfujing) to exchange for raw materials (yarn). When I finished handing in the socks and took the receipt to the south room to collect the yarn, the comrade in charge of distributing the yarn at the company had a very bad attitude, perhaps because he was older. He wouldn't let you choose the color you wanted. In order to better match the leftover yarn at home for further knitting, I had already specified the desired color when writing the receipt and handing in the socks. However, this comrade didn't listen at all and loudly said, "No exchanges, just take this one. Go wrap it outside!" This greatly stimulated me, a young person with insufficient funds and just learning production. I request:
    (1) The company should transfer the old comrade in charge of issuing yarn or order him to make a self-criticism.
    (2) The people's enterprises should cherish the people.　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Li Yan
Li Yan:
    We fully accept your criticism that our comrade in charge of issuing yarn in the yarn-for-socks exchange section has a bad attitude and speaks harshly. In addition to criticizing the comrade, we have also used this as education for all cadres and staff. However, we would like to briefly explain the actual situation as follows:
    Our yarn distribution room is very small, filled with foreign yarn, with only a small table at the entrance for taking yarn. At the same time, there are many people taking yarn, so people are not allowed to enter and pack on the table to avoid disorder and inconvenience to others. This is specially clarified.

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　(Beiping Trading Company)

　　贸易公司接受批评
    教育态度不好人员
    编辑同志：
    我是一个学生，暑假期间为了补助家庭生活，学成织袜手艺。一天，我带着成品（袜子）到北平市贸易公司交换原料（王府井梯子胡同一号）。在我交完袜子拿着单子到南屋领袜线时，该公司管领线的同志，也许因年纪大些态度十分不好，不许你随意要什么色，为了好配合家里的剩线再织，所以在写单交袜时即已写明要何种颜色。但是这同志一概不听；并且大声说：“不许换，就拿这个。外边去包！”使我这经济不足初习生产的年青人精神上受到很大刺激。我要求：
    （一）管出线的老同志应由公司调换或令其检讨。
    （二）人民的企业应当爱护人民。　　　　　　　　　　　　　　李言李言先生：
    你对我们以洋纱换袜子部分管出纱的同志对人态度不好，说话生硬的批评我们完全接受；除对该同志进行批评外，并以此向所有干部人员进行了教育。但在实际情况方面我们稍说明如下：
    我们出纱的屋子很小，里面满装着洋纱，仅在门口放一小桌作取纱用，同时取纱的人很多，所以不让取纱人进去和在桌子上打包，以免秩序紊乱和妨碍别人，特此附带陈明。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（北平市贸易公司）
