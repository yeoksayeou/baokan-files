　　A Visit with Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Representative
　　Special Invited Representative Mei Lanfang

　　Mr. Mei has been engaged in theatrical work for nearly forty years. He began studying drama at the age of nine and made his stage debut at eleven. He both worked and studied. He is also a lover of fine arts; he put effort into painting, and after discovering clues to ancient costumes from famous ancient paintings, he researched and created ancient costume song and dance dramas.

　　In 1935, Mr. Mei was invited by the Soviet Union's Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries to perform in the Soviet Union. At that time, the plays Mr. Mei performed included "Assassinating the Tiger," "Cosmic Frontier," "The Fisherman's Revenge," "Liang Hongyu," "Drunken Concubine," "Mulan Joins the Army," "Sword Dance," and "Halberd Dance." His performances were widely welcomed and praised by the Soviet people. His public performance proved that Chinese opera could also be understood in the Soviet Union.

　　After Mr. Mei returned from his overseas performances, he felt that there were many bad old habits in stage performances that often ruined the entire plot. He then resolved to actively break the stage habits of many years. For example, music accompanists should be placed in a less conspicuous position on the stage and hidden behind a hard gauze screen so that the audience's attention can be completely focused on the actors in the play. Also, stagehands should try to avoid appearing on the stage. Non-staff members are strictly prohibited from lingering on the stage or arbitrarily peeking at the backstage. Other aspects, such as the use of lighting, are also made to coordinate with the plot.

　　Mr. Mei had long started working on the reform of Peking Opera. For example, in "Selling the Horse," in the scene of "Crying in Prison," where Li Qi was trampled and oppressed by the jailers, and the sounds of groaning and wailing reached Li Guizhi's ears through the "Prison God," Mr. Mei felt that it was too absurd and unnecessary, so he deleted this section. When performing "Hongni Pass," he removed the ghost of Xin's father. Later, during a period of residence in Shanghai, he also created two plays, "Resisting the Jin Troops" and "Life and Death Regret," both of which aimed to raise the public's awareness of foreign aggression.

　　Before the liberation of Shanghai this year, someone hinted that he should leave Shanghai, but Mr. Mei replied, "I will definitely not leave this time." They were helpless with this attitude of his.

　　This summer, Mr. Mei attended the Literary and Art Congress and obtained a short-term study opportunity. This time, he attended the CPPCC as a specially invited representative, and he felt even more excited and happy. He said: "We can participate in the CPPCC. The People's Government deeply loves and hopes for us. In the future, we must work harder to reform the old opera." (Attached picture)

　　中国人民政协代表访问记
  　特邀代表梅兰芳
    姬传
    梅先生从事戏剧工作差不多四十年了。九岁开始学习戏剧，十一岁出台表演。他一面工作，一面学习。同时他还是一个爱好美术者，他下过工夫绘画，从古画名迹里面发现了古代服装的线索以后，曾研究创作编制古装的歌舞剧。
    一九三五年梅先生曾应苏联对外文化协会之请赴苏表演。当时梅先生演出之剧有刺虎、宇宙锋、打渔杀家、梁红玉、醉酒、木兰从军、剑舞、戟舞等。他的演出曾得到苏联人民广泛的欢迎与赞赏。由于他这次的公演，证明中国剧在苏联也是可以获得了解的。
    梅先生从国外公演旧来后，关于舞台演出方面感觉到有许多不好的旧习气，常常破坏了整个的剧情，便决心积极打破多年的舞台积习。譬如音乐伴奏员应安置在舞台上不很显著的地位，而用一种硬片纱窗隐蔽起来，使观众的注意力完全能集中在剧中人身上。又如检场人员尽力避免在舞台出现。非工作人员绝对禁止在舞台上逗留或在幕边任意窥视。其他如灯光之运用，也力使配合剧情。
    梅先生对改革平剧的问题早就着手去做，象贩马记，哭监的一场，李奇被狱卒蹂躏压迫，呻吟呼号的声音，由“狱神”传到李桂枝的耳中，梅先生觉得太荒诞，而且也不必要，就把这一节删去。表演虹霓关就把辛父神的鬼魂去掉。后来，在上海居住的一个时期，他更编了两出戏“抗金兵”，“生死恨”，都是提高群众对异族侵略的警觉性。
    这次上海解放以前，还有人暗示请他离开上海，梅先生答复他的话是“这一次决不走的”他们对他这种态度也无可奈何。
    今年夏天梅先生出席文代大会得到了短期学习机会。这次新政协他又作为特别邀请代表出席，他更感觉到兴奋愉快。他说：“我们能参加人民政协，人民政府对于我们的深切爱护与希望，今后要更努力的从事改革旧剧的工作。”（附图片）
