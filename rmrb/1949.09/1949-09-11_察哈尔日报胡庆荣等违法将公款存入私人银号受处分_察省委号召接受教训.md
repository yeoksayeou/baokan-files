Chahar News: The decision of the Chahar Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China regarding the mistake made by Hu Qingrong and others of Chahar Daily in depositing public funds into private banks is as follows:

Wang Zunliang, manager of the business department, Hu Qingrong, purchasing agent, and others of the Chahar Daily deposited a huge sum of over 20 million yuan of public funds into a private bank. After being discovered by the People's Bank of China in Beiping, they still did not repent and admit their mistake. They even conspired with unscrupulous merchants to create a false contract in an attempt to deceive the People's Government (see page 4 of this newspaper on the 4th of this month). This is indeed a serious illegal act. In addition to approving the Chahar Daily's self-criticism and disciplinary decisions, in order to educate the entire Party and strengthen vigilance, the following decisions are made:

I. Party committees at all levels, especially economic departments, must, based on this incident, conduct in-depth inspections in connection with the work of their respective departments, earnestly study and strictly implement the policies and decrees of the People's Government, establish a spirit of abiding by the law, act in accordance with policies in everything, become models of being law-abiding and implementing government policies and decrees, resolutely oppose departmentalism that only takes care of one's own unit or department, disregards policies, and disregards the interests of the people and the state, oppose purely economic viewpoints and speculative thinking, and stop and sanction all illegal acts.

II. Party committees at all levels should regularly educate all party members and cadres—especially economic personnel who are frequently out on business—that in transactions and contacts with urban merchants, they must be highly vigilant, strictly adhere to their positions, and not be paralyzed or fooled by any illegal merchants who provide us with temporary convenience in work and life, or any small favors, etc., so as not to lose the big picture due to small gains, be exploited by illegal merchants, lose their positions, and cause losses to the interests of the Party and the people.

中共察哈尔省委　八月二十五日
The Chahar Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, August 25th.

Chahar News: Chahar Daily has recently conducted a self-criticism of the mistake made by Hu Qingrong, Wang Zunliang and others in depositing public funds into private banks, and the full text of the self-criticism report has been published in the newspaper. The newspaper believes that depositing public funds into private banks, especially the attempt to deceive the government by creating a false contract after the incident occurred, is a serious illegal act. Although the direct responsibilities are different, the self-criticism from the perspective of the newspaper's leadership is not clear enough, and there is also a purely economic viewpoint. Before accepting the textbook loan, the newspaper held an administrative meeting to discuss the withdrawal, deposit, and use of the funds. The meeting proposed that the loan should not be deposited into private banks, but decided to withdraw the interest-free loan from the head office and then deposit it into the People's Bank of Beiping to generate interest. This is a dishonest attitude and an act of seeking profit from the public through speculation, which gives lower-level economic personnel room for activity and develops their departmentalism and selfishness. Regarding the prohibition of depositing public funds into private banks, the People's Government had already issued clear regulations in August of last year, and there have been repeated exposures in newspapers and documents. However, we lack serious study of the government's economic policies, and have not conducted regular education among economic department personnel, resulting in a purely economic viewpoint in specific work, only seeking small gains and making small calculations, and not knowing that once such huge funds are controlled by unscrupulous merchants, they will cause trouble, manipulate prices, disrupt the national economy, and affect the lives of the broad masses of the people. This is the root cause of the problem.

Secondly, this incident also shows that there is still serious bureaucracy in our leadership itself, and our cadres still have serious organizational and disciplinary ideas. For example, the administrative meeting decided to deposit the loan in the People's Bank of Beiping, but Gao Wanzhang, deputy director of the business department, did not clearly explain the task to Hu Qingrong, emphasizing "interest" and neglecting "not to deposit in private banks." Hu Qingrong did not follow the leader's instructions to find Wang Zunliang, the manager of the business department, but went to a private merchant first, and arbitrarily deposited the loan into the bank under the instigation of the merchant. Wang Zunliang handled the matter carelessly beforehand, and after the People's Bank discovered that it was illegal, he did not immediately become alert, resulting in one mistake after another. Deputy editor-in-chief Shen Chong did not immediately report to the provincial party committee after the incident, and attempted to delay and conceal it, and so on.

Again, this illegal incident is not only an economic problem, and not only causes losses to the national economy, but also demonstrates serious political paralysis. In particular, Hu Qingrong and Wang Zunliang were numb and insensitive under the deception and manipulation of unscrupulous merchants, allowing the merchants to manipulate them, and even created false contracts to deceive the government, completely losing their positions.

This incident has given us a serious lesson, and we have come to realize the truth that "we will make mistakes if we don't study." In particular, the idea of economic personnel that "studying policies has nothing to do with economic work or administrative work" is completely wrong. Therefore, in addition to requesting the government to give due punishment for the mistakes we have made, we have decided: (1) In addition to the fact that Deputy Editor-in-Chief Shen Chong has been given an advisory punishment by the Provincial Party Committee, purchasing agent Hu Qingrong, who did not follow the instructions of the leadership, was deceived by unscrupulous merchants, arbitrarily deposited a large amount of public funds into a private bank, and mistakenly transmitted the decision of the agency to Wang Zunliang. He did not repent after committing an illegal act once, and then took the lead in conspiring with private merchants to create a false contract to deceive the government. Hu Qingrong should bear the main responsibility for depositing the loan into a private bank, and is hereby dismissed from his post and handed over to the government for handling according to law. Wang Zunliang, the manager of the business department, did not stop Hu's wrong behavior beforehand, and participated in the main links of discussing deposit interest rates, terms, and making false contracts. Wang should bear the main responsibility for making false contracts in particular. He is hereby dismissed from his post and retained for further observation, and handed over to the government for handling according to law. Gao Wanzhang, the deputy manager of the business department, did not clearly explain the task and is hereby severely criticized. (2) Strengthen policy education for cadres, improve the policy level of cadres, and ensure that similar mistakes do not happen again. (3) Hold a meeting of all personnel within the newspaper to report and discuss this incident, and make a resolution to effectively strengthen the policy education of all personnel in the newspaper in the future and effectively implement government decrees. (4) Publicly expose the occurrence and handling of this serious illegal incident in the newspaper, admit mistakes, in order to safeguard the government's policies and decrees, and achieve the goal of "learning from past mistakes to avoid future ones."

　　察哈尔日报胡庆荣等违法将公款存入私人银号受处分
    察省委号召接受教训
    【察哈尔讯】中共察哈尔省委关于察哈尔日报社胡庆荣等将公款存入私人银号所犯错误的决定，原文如下：
    察哈尔日报社经理部长王遵良、采购员胡庆荣等，将二千余万元之巨额公款存入私人银号，经北平中国人民银行查出后，犹不知改悔认过，复与奸商共谋制造假合同，以图欺骗蒙蔽人民政府（详见本月四日本报第四版），此实为严重犯法行为。除批准察哈尔日报社的检讨及处分决定外，为教育全党，加强警惕，特作如下决定：
    一、各级党委，特别是经济部门工作人员，必须根据此一事件，联系自己部门工作，进行深入检查，认真学习和严格执行人民政府的政策法令，树立守法精神，一切根据政策办事，成为奉公守法、执行政府政策法令的模范，坚决反对只照顾本单位、本部门，不顾政策，不顾人民和国家利益的本位主义，单纯经济观点和投机取巧思想，并制止和制裁一切违法行为。
    二、各级党委应经常教育全体党员干部——特别是经常出外的经济工作人员，在对于城市商人进行交易和接触中，必须提高警惕，严守立场，不为任何不法商人给予我们一时工作上和生活上的便利，和一切小恩小惠等阴谋花样所麻痹、愚弄，以致因小失大，为不法商人所利用，而丧失立场，造成对党和人民利益的损失。
  　中共察哈尔省委　八月二十五日
    【察哈尔讯】察哈尔日报社顷对该社胡庆荣、王遵良等将公款存入私人银号的错误作了检讨，并将检讨报告全文在该报公布。该社认为：此次将公款存入私人银号，尤其是事情发生后又企图蒙蔽政府制造假合同的事件，是一种严重的犯法行为。虽然其直接责任有所不同，但是从报社领导思想上来检讨是不够明确的，并且同样存在着单纯经济观点。在接受教科书贷款之前，报社虽曾召开行政会议讨论该款的取存及使用问题，会议上并提出了不能将贷款存入私人银号，但决定从总行取出无利贷款，再转存北平市人民银行生利，这是一种不老实的态度，是向公家投机取巧图利的行为，这样就给下级经济工作人员以活动余地，发展了他们本位、自私思想。关于禁止将公款存入私人银号问题，人民政府早在去年八月间已有明文规定，报章文件中已屡有揭发，但我们对政府的经济政策，缺乏认真学习，特别没有在经济部门的工作人员中进行经常的教育，以致在具体工作中单纯经济观点，只图小利，打小算盘，不知道如此巨款一旦为奸商掌握，便会兴风作浪，操纵物价，捣乱国家经济，影响广大人民生活，这是问题发生的总根源。
    其次这一事件也说明我们领导本身还存在着严重的官僚主义，我们的干部还有严重的无组织无纪律思想。如行政会议上决定贷款存北平市人民银行，但经理部副部长高万章同志没有把任务向胡庆荣交代清楚，强调了“利息”，忽略了“不存私人银号”。胡庆荣至平未按领导上叮嘱去找经理部长王遵良同志，竟先到私商处，擅作主张，在商人怂恿下，将贷款存入银号。而王遵良同志事先轻率处理，既经人民银行查出已知是犯法，尚不立即警惕，以致一错再错。副社长沈重同志事后不立即向省委报告，企图拖一拖瞒过去等等。
    再次，此一违法事件，不仅是一个经济问题，不仅使国家经济遭受损失，而且表现了严重的政治上的麻痹。特别是胡庆荣和王遵良同志在奸商愚弄操纵下麻木不仁，一任商人摆布，甚至造假合同欺骗政府，完全丧失了立场。
    此一事件使我们得到严重的教训，从此更认识了“不学习就要犯错误”的真理。特别是经济工作人员“不学习政策，对经济工作、事务工作没什么关系”的想法，是完全错误的。因此我们除请求政府对所犯错误给予应有处分外，特决定：（一）除副社长沈重同志已由省委决定给予劝告处分外，采购员胡庆荣同志，不按领导上指示办事，受奸商愚弄，擅作主张将巨量公款存入私人银号，并向王遵良错传机关决定，一次犯法尚不改悔，二次又首先与私商共同谋订假合同欺蒙政府。胡庆荣对将贷款存入私人银号，应负主要责任，特予撤职处分，并送政府依法处理。经理部长王遵良同志对胡错误行为，事先不制止，并参加了商讨存款利息、期限及订假合同等错误行为的主要环节，特别在订假合同中，王应负主要责任。特予撤职留任处分，并送政府依法处理。副经理部长高万章同志，交代任务不清，特予严格批评。（二）加强干部的政策教育，提高干部的政策水平，保证不再有类似的错误事件发生。（三）在报社内部召开全体人员会议，报告讨论这一事件，并做出决议，今后切实加强全社人员的政策教育，切实执行政府法令。（四）将这一严重的违法事件的发生及处理经过，在报纸上公开揭露，承认错误，以维护政府的政策法令，达到“惩前毖后”的目的。
