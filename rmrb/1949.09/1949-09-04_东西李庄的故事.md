　　The Story of East and West Li Village
　　Qin Zhaoyang

　　East and West Li Village sounds like two villages, but it's actually one village. It is said that in the past, this area was all barren land. Later, two families of famine refugees came from the mountains in the west, one surnamed Huang and the other surnamed Zhao. Seeing the flat land here, they settled down to cultivate and farm, and gradually formed a village. Because the village was surrounded by plum trees, it was named Li Village.

　　Although the people of Li Village originally had two surnames, because they shared joys and hardships, they were like one family, and they were all prosperous and content, and there had never been any unpleasant things. Later, the Manchu Qing bannermen implemented "horse racing enclosure," and a bannerman on a large horse ran around Li Village, and all the land within the horseshoe circle became his private property. Most of the people in Li Village became his tenants, paying him rent every year. Later, the bannerman divided the land into two shares and sold it to two Han Chinese landlords, one surnamed Zhang and the other surnamed Wang. They built two large courtyards at the east and west ends of Li Village. People called the Zhang family at the east end the East Head Courtyard, and the Wang family at the west end the West Head Courtyard. The poor farmers of Li Village, mostly surnamed Huang, lived in the east end and were mostly tenants of the Zhang family's courtyard. Those surnamed Zhao mostly lived in the west end and were mostly tenants of the Wang family's courtyard. This is how the terms "East Head" and "West Head" began.

　　It is also said that when the bannerman sold the land, he originally didn't know how large his land was, and of course, he didn't know where the land sold to the Zhang and Wang families should be divided. The two families each had ulterior motives and tampered with the red contracts. Therefore, they later went to court over a large piece of land of four or five qing (approx. 66 acres), but the court muddled through the case, ruling that the two families would collect rent in alternate years. Neither family was satisfied. Every year when it came time to harvest the crops, the Zhang family would also bring tenants to steal the harvest, and the Wang family would also bring tenants to steal the harvest, encouraging the tenants to steal as much as they could, saying that the grain harvested would be split with the landlord. Some who loved petty gains were easily deceived, and there were often fights. After fighting, the two landlords would at most spend some money to buy a few packets of medicine, but the tenants would bleed and develop hatred.

　　This is how the animosity between the East and West Heads started. Once animosity was established, they forgot the days of sharing joys and hardships and starting a family together.

　　Later, one year, the Taiping rebels in the south revolted. A Taiping leader named Lin Fengxiang led his troops to Hebei Province, and some people in the villages around Li Village secretly sided with the Taiping. One day, an official spy was assassinated in the low-lying area of Li Village. The Manchu Qing emperor was shocked and sent an official to investigate. Coincidentally, that day was a big temple fair in Li Village, and the high-platform opera was very lively. When the official saw this, he returned and reported that the people here were so peaceful and uneventful. The emperor was pleased and issued many rewards to the people of Li Village to win them over. At that time, the Zhang family in the east head was more prominent among the two wealthy families in the village and handled the official well, so all the rewards were monopolized by his family, and only the farmers in the east head were given a few dozen tables of wine to celebrate. As a result, the Wang family in the west head became furious and incited the farmers in the west head to have a fierce fight with the east head, injuring several people. This deepened the animosity between the two heads even further.

　　Later, the wealthy family in the west head believed in Catholicism and relied on the power of foreigners to bully the east head. The wealthy family in the east head then started the Boxer Rebellion and burned the church in the west head, and the two heads again engaged in a bloody battle.

　　In the early years of the Republic of China, the wealthy family in the east head had more educated people who talked about "revolution," while the west head had military officers serving in the Manchu Qing Green Standard Army who talked about "protecting the emperor." The matter of cutting or keeping queues (braids) caused the people of the two heads to fight several more times.

　　As a result, the people of the two heads automatically divided into two villages, managed affairs under two separate land administrations, and paid grain taxes separately, named East Li Village and West Li Village. The surrounding villages simply referred to them as East and West Li Village.

　　In fact, East and West Li Village are only separated by a north-south alley that is six or seven feet wide. People in the nearby villages have made up some jokes, saying: "East and West compete, the alley is the boundary." It is also said: "The elder brother of the east village has a red nose, and the elder brother of the west village has swollen eyes. Why are they red, why are they swollen? It's not because your nose is high, it's not because his eyeballs bulge, it's just because you two villages are too close, you get up early and walk out the door, and you accidentally bump into each other."

　　Now, just talking about this north-south alley, there are two families living opposite each other. The family in the east head is surnamed Huang and is registered in East Li Village; the family in the west head is surnamed Zhao and is registered in West Li Village. Since East and West Li Village are bounded by the "alley," these two families can be said to be two "boundary markers." When the people of the two heads quarrel, these two families are the vanguard officers in front of the two armies, so the animosity between the two families is particularly great. The wealthy families often add fuel to the fire. The wealthy family in the east head says to the Huang family, "The alley in front of your house belongs to our East Li Village, and the people of West Li Village cannot be allowed to pass through it." The wealthy family in the west head also says to the Zhao family, "The alley in front of your house belongs to our West Li Village, and the people of East Li Village cannot be allowed to pass through it." Therefore, if the two families come face to face from the two ends of the alley at the same time, they either glare at each other or twist their necks. If the two families happen to meet each other carrying water, the buckets are sure to bump into each other, and they have to scold each other a few times. If the two families happen to meet each other driving carts, neither will give way and they have to fight a fierce battle. Therefore, if the Huang family's pig accidentally runs into the Zhao family's yard, don't expect it to come back with two ears. If the Zhao family's chicken accidentally flies into the Huang family's yard, don't expect it to come back with both wings intact. If the Huang family's kitten steals the Zhao family's chick, that kitten is sure to die within three days. If the Zhao family's old dog scares the Huang family's child, that dog is sure to be half-dead within three days. After the pigs, dogs, chickens, and sheep suffer, it's time for other things: the clothes drying in the Huang family's yard mysteriously disappear, and the peaches on the peach tree in the Zhao family's yard are stolen clean overnight. Then, the pile of firewood in the Huang family's yard will catch fire for no reason, and the water in the Zhao family's well will suddenly smell bad. …

　　Such things are countless and endless. No one can remember how many times the two families have argued or fought. Until before the War of Resistance Against Japan, the wealthy families of the East and West Heads declined because their descendants were incompetent, and the poor people of the East and West Heads seemed to be a little wiser, and there were fewer fights. However, the two families were still stubborn and fought openly and secretly, with no intention of compromise.

　　The old man in charge of the Huang family is named Huang Laogui. He is in his forties and has an explosive temper. He explodes with rage when touched, and his voice can overwhelm the entire village when he shouts. The old man in charge of the Zhao family is named Zhao Laofu, also in his forties or fifties. He has the stubbornness of a bull tendon. When he gets angry, he doesn't shout or jump, but he just grabs and hits, hitting people without trembling, and doesn't beg for mercy when he is beaten. Their temperaments are not only like needle points against wheat awns, but even their names are chosen to be opposed: "Hum! Your family is called Rich, and my family is called Noble, let's see who surpasses who!" So, from the time they were in their mothers' wombs, they were constantly educated by the adults, just like two little roosters, growing up in a contest of strength and victory, and now that they have lived for so many decades, they are still like two red-eyed chickens that cannot see each other.

　　It may be hard to believe, but Huang Laogui and Zhao Laofu, despite being such a pair of red-eyed chickens, have actually shared things together, and if they hadn't helped each other, neither of them would have survived.

　　This is quite interesting.

　　According to legend, many years ago, one day, just after continuous rain had cleared, Huang Laogui went to the fields to check the crops. When he was returning home at dusk, he heard someone shouting in the opposite field. Listening carefully, the shouting seemed to be coming from inside the ground. He rushed over and saw that the rainwater had loosened the soil under the ground, and a hole had collapsed (this area of the ground was originally silted up, and it often collapses during heavy rains). At this time, the person in the hole was shouting almost in tears. Huang Laogui untied his belt and lowered it, saying, "Don't worry, grab the belt and come up." The person below replied, "Oh, big brother, you are really accumulating virtue!" Unexpectedly, when they both pulled at the same time, the soil under Huang Laogui's feet softened, and he also fell in! Because it was dark and the hole was deep, neither of them could see each other inside. They asked each other nose to nose, "Who are you?" "Who are you?" As soon as the words were spoken, they both froze at the same time, and their hearts jumped up and down. It turned out that the person who had fallen down first was Zhao Laofu! Zhao Laofu immediately turned around, and Huang Laogui also immediately turned around, but they were still back to back, which was very awkward and burning hot. Huang Laogui tried to climb up, but the soil was loose and muddy, and he didn't succeed. Zhao Laofu tried, and he also failed. It was already dark, and they were hungry, and they felt cold, and their feet were in bottomless mud. Huang Laogui turned around again, and Zhao Laofu also turned around. They had never spoken to each other except for arguing in their whole lives, but at this time they couldn't hold back any longer.

　　Huang Laogui spoke first, saying, "Hey! What's going on?"

　　Zhao Laofu also chimed in, saying, "Hey! What to do?"

　　Huang Laogui said, "I'll step on your shoulders and go up first, okay?"

　　Zhao Laofu said, "But you can't leave and ignore me!"

　　Huang Laogui swore, "If I do that, may I be struck by lightning!"

　　Zhao Laofu said, "Alas, I still can't trust you."

　　There was no other way, so Zhao Laofu had to let Huang Laogui step on his shoulders and climb up. Once Huang Laogui came up, he originally wanted to not help Zhao Laofu, but he didn't dare to go back on his oath, so he deliberately procrastinated, until Zhao Laofu said good things for a long time below, then he re-used the belt to pull him up.

　　Neither Huang nor Zhao has ever admitted this matter to anyone, so it is impossible to determine whether this matter is true or just a fabrication of the people. However, another matter is true.

　　In the year of the July 7th Incident (1937), in the first few days, they heard that the Japanese had occupied the county seat. One day, a team of plainclothes secret agents really came to the village and demanded a thousand catties of wheat from each of the two villages. The next day, the East Li Village office assigned Huang Laogui to deliver the grain, and the West Li Village office happened to assign Zhao Laofu to deliver the grain. Huang Laogui had never seen the Japanese before and was extremely timid, but at that time, the words of the office were like imperial edicts, and he had to go, so he had to get up early and harden his heart to drive the cart to the city. When he reached the city gate, according to the method taught by the village office, he bowed to the Japanese and called out "Taijun" (Great Lord), but the Japanese and traitors wouldn't let him pass, and told him to stand at the city gate and wait. After waiting for half an hour, he saw a cart coming from afar, driven by Zhao Laofu. When he got closer, the traitor asked which village he was from, and then asked which village Huang Laogui was from, and asked how far the two villages were from each other, whether they knew each other, and how they addressed each other. Both of them understood: as long as they said they knew each other, they could pass immediately, otherwise, who knew what would happen? Both of them were so frightened that their legs were trembling like pipa strings, and their hearts were beating like small drums. Finally, they couldn't hold back.

　　This time, Zhao Laofu spoke first, saying, "I know him, his, his name is Huang Laogui."

　　Huang Laogui also quickly interjected, saying, "His, his name is Zhao, Zhao Laofu."

　　The traitor said fiercely, "Why didn't you say you knew each other earlier!?"

　　The two said in unison, "We, we were scared silly."

　　So the Japanese took out a small box and stamped a mark on both of their faces before letting them drive their carts through.

　　After this incident, they felt awkward about their animosity, but they both felt humiliated by the foreigners, and their anger was the same. Therefore, they didn't hide it from anyone when they returned to the village, and the two villages knew about it. Those who were wiser said, "It seems that no matter how great the hatred between us farmers is, it's not as great as the hatred against the Japanese."

　　In addition to these two incidents, the wives of Huang and Zhao also shared an incident together, which was also quite interesting.

　　It was three years ago. Both wives were picking wheat ears in the fields west of the village. This piece of land was originally planted by the Wang family's landlord himself, and he was never happy to let poor people pick the crops. The two saw that there were quite a few wheat ears lost in the field, so they lowered their heads and walked in without acknowledging each other, intending to quickly pick up a few handfuls and leave when no one was around. Unexpectedly, they were seen by the landlord's lackey standing on the high roof, and they were caught and taken to the Wang family's courtyard, where they were forced to say that they had stolen the wheat kernels from the field, were hung up and beaten, and were fined one dou (approx. 2 gallons) of wheat each. Of course, they both stubbornly denied it, but this bastard knew that they had deep-seated hatred for each other, so he deliberately asked, "Mother of Jinni, tell me, did you see the mother of Tiezi steal the wheat kernels?" Then he turned his head and asked, "Mother of Tiezi, tell me, did you see the mother of Jinni steal wheat kernels?" Then he shouted, "Speak up! Whoever tells the truth will be released!" This bastard was sure that the two would bite each other, but unexpectedly, neither of them said anything, which made him angry and shout, "You won't speak? Good! I'll beat you to death!" He raised his stick and showed no mercy, beating the two of them into a rage. They shouted in unison:

　　"She didn't steal!"

　　"She didn't steal!"

　　"Didn't steal! Didn't steal! Didn't steal!"

　　The bastard had no choice but to hang them up for the whole night. During this whole night, both of them thought of the hardships of the poor, sighed and shed tears, and both wanted to talk about their feelings!

　　In the year of the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Eighth Route Army came to this area and carried out various tasks such as reasonable burden, rent reduction and interest reduction, eliminating traitors and suppressing special agents. They used these three incidents of the two families to educate the people of the two villages, which gave the people a great feeling.

　　In the anti-traitor struggle, people also discovered that the Zhang and Wang landlords had both joined the Kuomintang and secretly colluded with the Japanese, and they cooperated with each other in destroying the anti-Japanese work. When some old people mentioned the landlords' instigation of the farmers to fight since their ancestors, everyone understood: originally, the wealthy families used the peasants as guns on the one hand for their own power and profit, and on the other hand, to make the farmers forget their class hatred, they deliberately let you hate each other. Once they understood this, people saw the real enemies and launched a vigorous struggle against the two landlords.

　　Later, the democratic government accepted the farmers' request and sent the two landlords to the county government to be imprisoned. East and West Li Village also removed the words "East" and "West" and merged into one village again.

　　However, although East and West Village were merged, the "boundary marker" of "alley as the boundary" had not been removed. At this time, although Huang Laogui and Zhao Laofu both had some awareness and had sued their grievances at the anti-special agents conference, the two families were too stubborn. They were fine in their hearts, but they were always embarrassed to greet and talk to each other on the surface. They always deliberately avoided each other when they encountered anything. No matter what the people in the village thought of to stick the two families together, they couldn't.

　　Speaking of this, it should be attributed to the daughters and sons of the two families.

　　At this time, Huang's Jinni had grown to eighteen years old. She had a good appearance, and she was good at all kinds of work at home and in the fields. A few years ago, she found a family in another village, but the son of that family was caught by the Japanese before she got married, and there was no news of him. Zhao's Tiezi was now twenty years old, and he was also a good young man with thick eyebrows, big eyes, wide shoulders, and a thick chest. He was superior in all kinds of field work. Because his family was poor, he hadn't married a wife. At this time, Jinni joined the Women's Federation, and all kinds of work became "models." Tiezi also became a militiaman, and he was quite majestic when he carried his gun. Both of them participated in the winter school and walked back and forth from the same alley every night. They had long been in love with each other, but they were afraid that their parents would have prejudices against each other and did not dare to say it.

　　Later, Jinni often went to the Zhao family across the street to borrow furniture, and Tiezi often went to the Huang family across the street to check the tunnels dug by the militiamen. As soon as Jinni entered the Zhao family's door, Tiezi was busy arranging things. As soon as Tiezi entered the Huang family's door, Jinni was also busy answering. Both parents saw it in their eyes and agreed in their hearts, but they were just hampered by a layer of face, and neither family was embarrassed to mention it clearly.

　　Until the winter of 1947, when the land reform was implemented, the land of the Zhang and Wang landlords was distributed to the farmers, and "land was returned to the family" was implemented. In addition to dividing the land, the poor peasant group deliberately divided a donkey between the Huang and Zhao families. At first, both families were embarrassed to lead it home to feed it, but Jinni and Tiezi made the decision and led it back to feed it for three days each. This donkey was led back and forth, connecting the doors of the two families into one family. On the first day of the first lunar month of the following year, Zhao Laofu suddenly came to Huang Laogui's house to pay New Year's greetings, calling him big brother and sister-in-law, and Huang Laogui and his wife suddenly looked like old relatives, warmly pulling him to drink tea and peel peanuts. They talked casually, and finally talked about the marriage of their children.

　　Zhao Laofu asked, "How old is your Jinni?"

　　Huang Laogui said, "Hey, she's eighteen."

　　Zhao Laofu said, "Brother, you are lucky. This good daughter is better than a man at work."

　　Jinni's mother said, "Hey! Uncle, to tell you the truth, her father is getting old, and there's no son to inherit the family business. This girl originally said she would marry into a family, hoping that her son-in-law would be a good support, but that son-in-law is now gone, hey!"

　　Zhao said, "Hey, don't worry about this. Now the government encourages divorce. After the divorce, we'll find another family..."

　　Jinni's mother interjected and asked, "Your Tiezi is probably twenty, right? Why haven't you found a wife yet?"

　　Zhao Laofu sighed and said, "That's right, but there's never been a suitable family..."

　　Having said this, Zhao Laofu had a bottom in his heart. He went back and asked a matchmaker, and it was done in one word. On the fifteenth day of the first lunar month, a good day, the daughters and sons of the two families got married.

　　From then on, the Huang and Zhao families became one family, and the "boundary marker" of East and West Li Village was uprooted. Li Village, as one village, was once again prosperous, content, harmonious, and beautiful, with nothing unpleasant anymore.

　　东西李庄的故事
    秦兆阳
    东西李庄听名字象两个村，其实是一个村。据说：从前这地方一片都是荒地，后来从西边山里来了两家逃荒户，一家姓黄，一家姓赵，看见这里一展平川，就住下来开荒种地，慢慢的才成了个村庄。因为围村尽是李子树，就取名叫李庄。
    这李庄的人祖辈上虽然是两姓，只因共过甘苦，倒象一家人一样，也都富富足足的，从来没有发生过不痛快的事情。后来满清旗人实行“跑马圈地”，一个旗人骑着匹大马围李庄一跑，凡马蹄圈子以内的地就都成了他的私产了，全李庄的人们就多数都成了他的佃户，每年给他交租子。后来这旗人又把地分成两股卖给了两家汉人地主，这两家地主一家姓张，一家姓王，在李庄东西两头盖了两座大院落，人们叫东头张家是东头大院，叫西头王家是西头大院。李庄的穷苦农民们姓黄的多半住东头，多是张家大院的佃户，姓赵的多半住西头，多是王家大院的佃户，这就开始有了“东头”和“西头”的说法。
    又据说，当初旗人卖地时，本来就不知道自己的地有多大块，当然就更不知道卖给张王两家的地该从那里分开，他两家又各存坏心，都在红契上捣鬼，所以后来为了四五顷大一块地两家打官司，官厅里却糊里糊涂的结了案，判定两家轮年收租，两家都不服，每年到收割庄稼时，张家也带着佃户去偷割，王家也带着佃户去偷割，鼓动佃户说是偷多少是多少，打下粮食跟东家对半分，有些爱贪小利就越易受骗，有时常打架，打来打去，两家地主至多不过出点钱买几包药，佃户们却流了血结了仇。
    东西头的仇气就是这样起来的。一结了仇，就把祖辈们同甘共苦和睦起家的事情忘了。
    后来，有一年南边长毛造反，有个叫林凤祥的长毛领着人马打到河北省来，李庄这一带村子就有的人暗里顺了长毛。有一天，官家一名探子走到李庄洼里被人暗杀了，满清皇帝大惊，派一名官儿来调查，赶巧这天李庄正是个大庙会，高台大戏非常热闹，这官儿来一看，回去奏上一本，说这里老百姓如此这般太平无事。皇上高兴，为了收买人心，给李庄老百姓发下许多赏赐。当时这村两家财主里东头张家比较有头面，对这官儿应付的好，所以这一切的赏赐都被他家独吞了，只给了东头农民们请了几十桌酒庆贺了一番。这一来西头王家可就气红了眼，就鼓动的西头农民跟东头打了一场恶架，伤了好几个人。这一来两头的仇气就结的更深了。
    后来，西头财主信天主教，倚仗洋人势力欺负东头，东关财主又闹义和团烧西头的教堂，两头又干了个血流成河。
    到民国初年，东头财主念书的人多，讲“革命”，西头有在满清绿营里当武官的，讲“保皇”，剪辫子和留辫子的事使得两头的人们又干了几回架。
    这么一来，两头的人们就自动分成东西两个村，分两个地保管事，分两头完粮纳税，取名叫东李庄和西李庄，四外的村就简称它为东西李庄。
    这东西李庄实际上当中只隔一条六七尺宽的南北胡同，附近村的人们给编了些笑话，说道：“东西相争，胡同为界。”又说：“东村大哥鼻子红，西村大哥眼睛肿，干吗红来干吗肿？不怪你的鼻子高，不怪他的眼珠凸，只怪你两村离的近，早起抬腿走出门，未曾小心碰了碰。”
    如今单说这条南北胡同里面，住着对门两家，东头那家姓黄，是东李庄的户口；西头那家姓赵，是西李庄的户口。这东西李庄既是“胡同”为界，这黄赵两家就可以说是两块“界碑”，两头人打吵起来，他两家就是两军阵前的先锋官，所以两家的仇气更是特别大。财主们又常趁风拨火，东头财主对黄家说：“你家门口那条胡同是属俺们东李庄的，可不能让西李庄的人走呀。”西头财主也对赵家说：“你家门口那条胡同是属俺们西李庄的，可不能让东李庄的人走呀。”于是，两家人如果同时面对面的从胡同两头走来了，不是互相瞪眼，就是互相扭脖子。如果两家都担着水面对面的遇上了，水桶准得碰一下，就得骂几句街。如果两家都赶着大车对面遇上了，就谁也不给准让路就得打一场恶架。于是，如果黄家的猪失错跑进赵家院里去了，就别想还是长两个耳朵回来。如果赵家的鸡失错飞进黄家院里去了，也别想两个翅膀不断一个。如果黄家的小猫偷吃了赵家的小鸡，不出三天那小猫准得丧了命。如果赵家的老狗吓着了黄家的孩子，不出三天，那狗准得落个半死。猪狗鸡羊都遭了殃，就该轮到别的了：黄家院里晒的衣裳不知怎么不见了，赵家院里桃树上的桃儿就一夜被偷了个净光。接着，黄家院里的柴禾堆会无故起火，赵家院里井里水忽然臭气薰天。……
    象这样的事真是数不完说不尽，谁也记不清他两家吵过多少回嘴，打过多少回架。直到抗战以前，东西头两家财主因为后辈人不成器，比早先家落势衰了，东西两头穷人们也象是心眼儿明白些，打架的事儿也就少了，他两家却还是死心眼的明争暗斗，决没有妥协的意思。
    这黄家当家主事的老头子名叫黄老贵，四十多岁，是个爆仗脾气，碰着了就爆跳如雷，嚷起来声音压全村。这赵家当家主事的老头子名叫赵老富，也是四五十岁，有个牛筋子劲儿，生起气来不嚷不跳，只是扭住就打，打人不手颤，挨打也不叫饶。他俩不说这脾气是针锋儿对麦芒儿，就连取的名字也是对着的：“哼！你家叫富，俺家就叫贵，看看谁赛过谁！”所以他俩从在娘怀里时就不断的受大人们的教育，就象两只小公鸡似的，是在争强比胜里面长大的，到现在活了这么几十年，还象是两只见不得面的红眼鸡。
    这黄老贵的老婆子人们都叫她金妮她娘，原因是她有个闺女名叫金妮。赵老富的老婆子人们都叫她铁子他娘，原因是她有个小子名叫铁子。两个老婆子都是心窄量小的人，都是男人的拨火棍。黄老贵虽然没有小子，却还有个光棍兄弟，虽然是个老实窝囊肺，每逢跟赵家吵打起来时他也能帮两手，所以两家摆起阵势来，也正是针锋相对，谁也不弱过谁。
    说起来叫人难信，这黄老贵和赵老富虽是这么一对红眼鸡，两人却还共过事情，并且要不是互相帮了一手，恐怕谁也活不了命。
    这说起来也怪有意思的。
    据人们传说，在多年以前，有一天，正是连天大雨刚晴，黄老贵上地里去看庄稼，天傍黑时回家，走到洼中间时，听见对面地里有人嚷叫，再一听，叫声象是从地里面出来的，赶上去一看，原来是雨水把地皮下面的土泡松了，陷进去了一个洞（这一带地面原是水淤起来的，每年下大雨时常会陷下去一块），这时洞里那人嚷叫的简直带了哭腔了。黄老贵就解下束腰带垂下去，叫道：“别着急，拉住束腰带就上来了。”下边也答道：“哎呀，大哥，你这可是积德呀！”不想上下同时一使劲时，黄老贵脚下的土一软，也陷下去了！因为天又暗洞又深，两人在里面谁也瞅不见谁，就鼻子碰鼻子的互相问道：“你是谁？”“你是谁？”话音刚落，两人都同时一楞，两颗心都嘣嘣跳起来，原来先掉下来的那人正是赵老富！赵老富马上一转身，黄老贵也马上一转身，可是还是背挨着背，火辣辣的怪蹩扭。黄老贵扒啦扒啦想上去，可是四边土松泥软，不成功。赵老富试了试，也失败了。天已经黑了，肚子也饿了，身上也觉着冷，脚下又是没腿的泥浆子，黄老贵就又转过身来，赵老富也转过身来，两人一辈子除了吵架没说过话，这时却再也忍不住了。
    黄老贵先开口说：“咳！怎么着？”
    赵老富也接腔说：“嗨！怎么办？”
    黄老贵说：“我踏在你肩膀上先上去吧？”
    赵老富说：“那你可别走了不管我呀！”
    黄老贵赌咒说：“要是那么着，我遭天雷打！”
    赵老富说：“唉，还是靠不住。”
    黄老贵说：“靠不住怎么着？咱俩都死在这儿吧！”
    没法，赵老富只得让黄老贵踏在肩头子上爬上去了。黄老贵一上来，本想不给赵老富帮忙，可是赌了咒不敢翻悔，只得故意多磨蹭时间，直急的赵老富在底下说了半天好话，才重新用束腰带拉他上来。
    黄赵两人从来没对人承认过这件事，所以这事到底是真事还是人们瞎编的，实在没法确定，不过另外有一件事倒是真的。
    七七抗战那年，头几天听说日本人占了县城，这一天村里真的来了一队便衣特务，向两个村各要一千斤麦子。第二天，东李庄办公的派的是黄老贵出夫送粮，西李庄办公的恰巧也派的是赵老富出夫送粮。黄老贵没见过日本人，胆怯得不行，可是那时办公的说句话就是圣旨，不去不行，只得起早硬着头皮赶着大车往城里走，走到城门口，按村办公的教的办法，对日本人行了个鞠躬礼，叫了声“太君”，不想日本人和汉奸不让走，叫他站在城门口等着。等了半个多钟头，只见老远又来了辆车，赶车的却是赵老富。等他走近了，汉奸问他是那村的，又问黄老贵是那村的，又问他们两个村离多远，认不认的，互相怎么称呼。两人都明白：只要说一声认的，马上就可以通过，要不的话，谁知道会发生什么事情？两人都吓的两腿弹琵琶，急的心里敲小鼓，最后到底蹩不住了。
    这回是赵老富先开口，说：“俺认的，他、他叫黄老贵。”
    黄老贵也忙接口说：“他、他叫赵、赵老富。”
    汉奸凶道：“你们认的怎么不早说！？”
    两人齐声道：“俺们是、是吓傻啦。”
    于是日本人掏出个小盒来，往他俩脸上都盖了个戳子，才让赶着车过去了。
    这件事过后，他俩在各人的仇气上说是觉着蹩扭，可是都觉着受了洋人的羞辱，气恨的劲儿却是一致的，所以回村后并不瞒人，说的两个村都知道了，明白些的人就说：“看起来咱庄稼人那怕有天大的仇，也不跟对日本人的仇大。”
    除了这两件事以外，黄赵两家的老婆子也共过一回事，也是挺有意思的。
    是三年以前的事，两家老婆子都在村西地里拾麦穗，这块地原是王家财主自己雇长活种的，向来是不高兴叫穷人拾庄稼的，两人看见这地里丢的麦穗挺多，就低着头谁也没招见谁地走进去了，本打算趁没人时赶紧拾两把就走的，不想就被财主家狗腿子站在高房上看见了，赶的来捉到王家大院里，硬说她俩偷了地里的麦子个儿，吊起来揍了一顿，还要每人罚一斗麦子。她俩当然死口咬定不承认，可是这坏蛋知道她俩下有难解的仇，就故意问道：“金妮她娘，你说说，你看见铁子他娘偷了麦子个儿没有？”又回头问这边道：“铁子他娘，你说说，你看见金妮她娘偷麦个儿没有？”又喝道：“快说！谁说了实话就放了谁！”这坏蛋满以为她两下里会互相咬对的，不想两下里谁也死口不说，就气的跳起来嚷道：“不说？好！揍死你们！”抡起棍子就下绝情，打的两人火起，不约而同的齐声嚷道：
    “她没偷！”
    “她没偷！”
    “没偷！没偷！没偷！”
    这坏蛋没法，把她俩都吊了一整夜。在这一整夜里，两人都想到了穷人的苦处，都叹气流泪，都是多么想互相说说心里话啊！
    抗战胜利那年，这一带来了八路军，进行合理负担减租减息除奸反特各种工作，就用他两家这三件事对两村的人们进行教育，给了人们很大的感动。
    在反特斗争中，人们又发现了原来张王两家地主都参加了国民党，暗里都跟日本人有勾结，在破坏抗日工作上并且互相配合行动。有些老年人再一提起老辈子以来地主挑拨农民们闹架的事，大伙就都明白了：原来财主们是一方面为了自己争权夺利，把农民当枪使；一方面为了叫农民们忘了阶级仇恨，才故意让你们互相结仇。一明白了这个事，人们这才看清了真正的仇人，就对两家地主展开了一个轰轰烈烈的斗争。
    后来，民主政府接受农民的要求，把两家地主送到县政府里关起来了。东西李庄又把“东西”两个字去掉了，又合成一个村了。
    可是东西庄虽然合并了，“胡同为界”的“界碑”却还没拔掉。这时黄老贵和赵老富两家虽然也都有些觉悟，并且都在反特大会上诉过冤情，可是两家人性都太死巴，心里是已经没事了，面子上总不好意思打招呼说话，碰见什么事情时也总是故意避开，无论村里人们想什么法儿替他两家往一块粘也粘不拢。
    说到这里，就该归功于两家的闺女和小子了。
    这时黄家的金妮已经长到十八岁，出落的模样好，家里地里灶上灶下的活儿都是好手，前几年本来在外村里找了个婆家，不想还没成亲那家的小子就被日本人抓去，一直没个信儿。赵家的铁子这时整二十，也是个粗眉大眼宽肩膀厚胸脯的好小伙，耕耩锄耪各样地里活儿都高人一等，因为家里穷，也没娶媳妇。这时金妮参加了妇女会，各样工作都起“模范”。铁子也当了民兵，背起枪来也挺威武。两人都参加了冬学，每天夜里来回从一个胡同里走，两人早就言来语去了的心心相印了，只是怕爹娘们互相抱成见，没敢提出来说。
    后来，金妮常到对门赵家去借家具使，铁子也常到对门黄家去检查民兵们挖的地道。金妮一进赵家的门，铁子就忙张罗。铁子一进黄家的门，金妮也忙着答应。两家爹娘都看在眼里，也都心里同意，却只是碍着一层脸皮，谁家也不好意思明提。
    直到一九四七年冬天实行土地改革，把张王两家地主的地分给了农民，实行了“土地还家”，黄赵两家除了分了地，贫农团还故意给伙分了一匹驴。起先两家都不好意思牵到家里喂，还是金妮和铁子作了主，牵回来一家喂三天。这匹驴牵来牵去，把两家的门串成了一家。到第二年的正月初一，赵老富突然到黄老贵家来拜年，满口大哥嫂子的叫，黄老贵老俩口也忽然象对老亲家似的，亲亲热热的硬拉着喝茶剥落花生，两下里就一句赶一句的说起闲话儿来，说到最后，就说到儿女亲事上来了。
    赵老富问：“你家金妮有多大了？”
    黄老贵说：“咳，十八了哩。”
    赵老富说：“老哥，你有福，这好闺女，干起活来赛男人。”
    金妮的娘说：“嗨！她大叔，不瞒你说，这会她爹也老啦，没个小子得继，这丫头原说了个婆婆家，指望女婿是个靠膀吧，那女婿如今又没了下场，咳！”
    赵说：“哎，这个事甭愁，如今的政府兴退婚，退了婚再说一家……”
    金妮的娘又插嘴问：“你家铁子敢怕也有二十了吧？怎么也还不寻媳妇？”
    赵老富叹口气说：“可就是哩，老没合式的人家……”
    说到这里，赵老富心里有了底，回去就托了个媒人，一说就成，正月十五好日子，两家的闺女小子就成了亲。
    从此黄赵两家就成了一家人，东西李庄的“界碑”就连根的拔掉了，李庄一个村也就又象从前一样，大伙都是富富足足和和美美的，再也没有什么不大痛快的事儿了。
