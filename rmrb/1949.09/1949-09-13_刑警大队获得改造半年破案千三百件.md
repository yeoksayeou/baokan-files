The Criminal Police Brigade Transformed, Solves 1300 Cases in Half a Year

[This Newspaper News] The Criminal Police Brigade of the Beiping Municipal Public Security Bureau, after half a year of organizational rectification and ideological education since liberation, has overcome the comprador mentality and bureaucratic style, and begun to embark on the road of serving the people. Before liberation, the Criminal Police Brigade was called the Detective Team, which colluded with bandits and hooligans and was a reactionary tool for the Kuomintang to rule the people. When bandits and robbers broke the law, the Detective Team was their legal cover; when the interests of the people were harmed, it was a good opportunity for them to extort and blackmail; the people hated them to the core.

After liberation, the People's Public Security Bureau took over this corrupt organization, first purged more than 90 visible special agents in the reactionary organization (sent to the Qinghe Brigade for training and management), and then concentrated its efforts on ideological education (studying new outlooks on life and other revolutionary books and newspapers, organizing accusations against the old society, etc.), gradually breaking down various misconceptions about the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army, further eliminating hidden special agents and notorious elements, and destroying the most reactionary Directly Subordinate Group, Special Task Group, and Intelligence Group, etc., and replacing them with organizational structures suitable for the interests of the masses and the needs of work.

In terms of professional learning: taking daily work as the content, such as on-site investigation, analyzing materials, and going through the process of solving cases, studying its successes and failures, drawing experience, and then combining it with the people's government's public security policies for education. This improved professional skills and enabled everyone to initially understand the policies.

Now the team is gradually establishing a new style. Many people stay up all night because a piece of work is not finished; Cheng Jicheng, the fourth squad leader, did not sleep for two days and two nights because a case was not dealt with. The matter of accepting bribes has now been basically eliminated. When Cheng Fengqi, the second squad leader of the fourth squad, cracked a robbery case, Wang Jingyi, the person who handed over the stolen goods, attempted to bribe him, and sent him two bags of rice and three bags of flour. He resolutely refused and brought Wang Jingyi to the team, convened a meeting of all detectives, and criticized Wang Jingyi on the spot, combining the actual situation to educate the detectives. The thief Wang Hanqing entrusted someone to send Kang Wennian, the leader of the first shift of the first team of the third squad, twenty silver dollars, asking for more "care." At that time, Kang Wennian resolutely refused.

Due to the progress of the Criminal Police Team itself, the people's views on them are now very different from the past. When the people have accidents, they report the case to the section with complete trust, or report the case directly to the brigade headquarters by letter or telephone (this situation was rare during the Kuomintang rule). Precisely because of this, the team's work in solving cases has been unprecedentedly smooth, solving a total of 1,327 cases from February to July.

　　刑警大队获得改造半年破案千三百件
    【本报讯】北平市公安局的刑警大队，经解放后半年来的组织整顿与思想教育，克服了雇佣观点与官僚作风，开始走上为人民服务的道路。刑警大队在解放前叫做侦缉队，与土匪流氓相结合，为国民党统治人民的反动工具。土匪强盗犯了法，侦缉队就是他们合法的掩护机关；人民的利益受到危害时，则又是他们敲诈勒索的好机会；人民对他们恨入骨髓。
    解放后，人民公安局接管了这个腐败的组织，首先肃清了九十多名反动组织机构中的有形特务（送进清河大队实行管训），然后集中力量进行思想教育（学习新人生观与其他革命书报，组织对旧社会的控诉等），逐渐打破对中国共产党与人民解放军的各种错误认识，进一步肃清了暗藏的特务分子和劣迹昭著的分子，摧毁了最反动的直辖组、特勤组、情报组等，而代之以适合群众利益和工作需要的组织机构。
    在业务学习方面：以日常工作为内容，如现场勘察，分析材料，破案经过等，研究其成功与失败，得出经验，再结合人民政府的治安政策进行教育，这样提高了业务技术，并使大家都初步的了解了政策。
    现在该队已在逐渐建立新的作风。有很多人因为一件工作没作完，而通宵不眠；第四中队长程继承因一个案件没处理完，两天两夜没睡觉。受贿的事情现已基本绝迹。第四中队第二分队长程凤歧破获一个抢匪案件时，交赃人王敬一企图收买他，曾给他送了两包大米、三袋面粉，他坚决拒绝，并将王敬一带队，召开了全体探警会，当场批评了王敬一，结合实际对探警进行教育。窃犯王汉卿曾托了一个人送给第三中队一分队一班长康文年大头二十元，要求多加“关照”，当时康文年坚决予以拒绝。
    由于刑警队本身的进步，人民对他们的看法现已大不同于往日了。人民出了事故，都以完全信任的态度到段上去报案，或者用信件，用电话直通大队部报案（这样的情形在国民党统治时期是很少有的）。正因如此，该队破案的工作空前顺利，二月至七月共破案一千三百二十七起。
