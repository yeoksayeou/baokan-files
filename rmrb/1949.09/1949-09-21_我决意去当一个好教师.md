I am Determined to Become a Good Teacher
    Jin Jingxiang
    I remember a classmate saying, "I hate education classes the most. After graduation, I'll be a poor elementary school teacher!" There was infinite regret in his words, as if being an elementary school teacher greatly wronged him. I used to have this kind of thought too. Until I saw "Teacher of All Ages" (Confucius), I still had the idea that if I could go to university after graduation, I would definitely find a way to go to university. I looked down on elementary school teachers. What can an elementary school teacher accomplish? It's only good to be some kind of "expert"!
    This is entirely the petty bourgeoisie's erroneous consciousness of climbing upwards. We should know that today's learning is not for promotion and wealth, nor is it to show off to others in order to satisfy our sense of superiority and vanity. We are learning for the people and for building a new democratic society. In today's China, what is more urgently needed than the popularization of education? Since it is so important, since the people need us so much, why don't we go? Since we are serving the people, what choice do we need to make? Whatever people need us to do, we should do it. I have no more hesitation. I can repeat Hua Na's words: "I am determined to become a teacher!"
    Now I know that teachers not only impart general cultural knowledge, but more importantly, ideological leadership. Today, how many children need us to educate! Hua Na once said, "To enable many glorious figures to emerge from the masses!" We should be determined to do this work and prepare to do this work well.
    A classmate who had seen this movie said, "We can't just say, 'I also decided to become a teacher' because we admire Hua Na. More importantly, you decide how to be a teacher." That's right, we want to be a teacher, but we can't just say, "I want to be a teacher." We should prepare how to be a good teacher. This undoubtedly requires us to study very well. From today onwards, I want to abandon all fantasies and honestly learn the knowledge that a normal school student should learn, and work hard for the children I will educate in the future.

　　我决意去当一个好教师
    金景湘
    记得一位同学说，“我最讨厌上教育课，毕业后当一个穷小学教员!”言下有无限遗恨，好象做小学教师大大屈委了他。这种思想我也有过，直到看“万世师表”前，我尚存着一个念头：毕业后如能够上大学，我必设法升大学。我看不起小学教师，一个小学教师能有什么作为？只有作个什么什么“家”才好！
    这完全是小资产阶级向上爬的错误意识。我们该知道，今天的学习不是为升官发财，也不是为向别人显耀自己，以满足我们的优越感和虚荣心。我们是为人民而学习，为建设新民主主义社会而学习。在目前的中国，有什么比普及教育工作更迫切需要呢？既然它是那样重要，既然人民是那样需要我们，我们为什么不去呢？既然我们是为人民服务，我们又有什么选择的必要呢？人们需要我们做什么，我们就应该去做什么。我再没有犹疑了，我可以重复华娜的一句话：“我决意去当教师”！
    现在我知道了，教师不只是传授一般文化知识，更重要的是思想领导。今天有多少儿童正需要我们去教育！华娜曾这样说：“使多少光荣人物，从群众中产生出来！”我们该下决心去做这个工作，并准备作好这件工作。
    一位看过这个电影的同学说：“我们不能只是因了羡慕华哪而说：我也决定去当一个教师，更重要的，是你决定怎样去当一个教师”。对的，我们要当一个教师，但我们不能只说：“我要当一个教师”就够了，我们应该准备如何当好这个教师。这无疑地就是需要我们很好地去学习。从今天起，我要抛弃一切幻想，老老实实地学习一个师范生应学的知识，为了我未来要教育的那些孩子们努力学习。
