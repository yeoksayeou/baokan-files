Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 18th. Hubei Province has achieved significant results in the month since launching focused bandit suppression in early August. According to statistics from the Hubei Military Region, the province annihilated 9,684 bandits in August, seizing 12 mortars, 25 60mm mortars, 6 infantry guns, 38 heavy machine guns, 313 light machine guns, 9,227 rifles and short guns, 25 grenade launchers, and some other ammunition and military supplies. Bandit leaders who were forced to surrender included Tian Daolan, deputy commander of the puppet Hubei Security 7th Brigade, and Li Kuohai, commander of the bandit Hunan Guerrilla Column. Captured bandit leaders included Liu Xianda, regimental commander of the bandit regular army 668th Regiment, Yang Bufang, commander of the bandit Gong'an County Self-Defense Regiment, and Li Nanshan, deputy commander of the bandit Jianli County Self-Defense Regiment.

The results of bandit suppression in the province in August increased by more than double the average of 4,000 annihilated bandits in the past three months of May, June, and July. The main reason for achieving such great results is that after the two party representative conferences held by the Hubei Military Region and the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China in August, the shortcomings in past work have been overcome, the bandit suppression teams have been reorganized, and a method of concentrating forces for focused suppression has been adopted, coupled with close coordination with political offensives, causing most bandits to be defeated or disintegrated. For example, the Xiaogan Sub-district leadership originally only knew that there were 600 bandits in the entire district, which led to complacency and underestimation of the enemy. However, after the party representative conference, after careful investigation, it was discovered that there were more than 1,000 bandits and scattered bandits in the entire district. After breaking the complacency, they immediately entered focused bandit suppression. In one month, in addition to defeating many bandits, they also won over seven groups of bandits to surrender their weapons. The Mianyang Sub-district first concentrated its forces to suppress the Li Kuohai bandit group entrenched in Jianli, Shishou, and other counties on the border of Hubei and Hunan. After 20 days of encirclement and pursuit, Li was finally forced to lead his troops of more than 200 to surrender. Under the influence of this victory, other large and small bandit groups also wavered and disintegrated, and surrendered to us one after another. In 20 days, more than 2,200 bandits were annihilated. The Daye Sub-district combined bandit suppression with support for the front lines. First, it concentrated its forces on the Wu (chang) Chang (sha) Highway, defeating and disintegrating four bandit companies, making highway transportation smooth. In the older liberated areas, the masses were mobilized to suppress scattered bandits and combat special agent riot conspiracies. In mid-August, Yuan'an County also developed more than 180 people's armed forces in conjunction with bandit suppression. After the mass bandit suppression movement was launched in other regions, local bandit prevention and self-defense work was further organized.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 18th. The Jiangxi Military Region Command of the People's Liberation Army recently announced the province's bandit suppression achievements in July and August as follows: As of August 15, a total of 12 bandit military local teams and 29 bandit gangs were completely or largely annihilated, 61 bandit gangs and puppet township and bao armed forces surrendered, totaling 7,900 bandit officers and soldiers killed, wounded, captured, and surrendered. 112 60mm mortars and mortars, 22,900 rifles and short guns, 502 light and heavy machine guns, 567,000 rounds of various bullets, 6 boats, 12 horses, and many other weapons, ammunition, and supplies were seized.

　　重点清剿配合政治攻势
　  湖北八月份歼匪近万
    各地群众积极加强防匪自卫
    【新华社汉口十八日电】湖北省自八月初开展重点剿匪后，一月来已获得显著成绩。据湖北军区统计，八月份全省歼匪达九千六百八十四名，缴获迫击炮十二门，六零炮二十五门，步兵炮六门，重机枪三十八挺，轻机枪三百十三挺，长短枪共九千二百二十七支，掷弹筒二十五个，及其他弹药军需物资一部。匪首被迫投降者有伪湖北保安第七旅副旅长田道蓝，匪湖南游击纵队纵队长李扩海等人，俘匪首匪正规军六六八团团长刘先达、匪公安县自卫团团长杨步芳，匪监利县自卫团副团长李南山等。
    全省八月份的剿匪战绩，比过去五、六、七三个月的剿匪成绩平均数四千名增加一倍以上。获得这样大的成绩的主要原因，是经过八月份湖北军区和中共湖北省委两次党代表会议后，过去工作中的缺点已经克服，整顿了剿匪队伍，采取了集中力量进行重点清剿的办法，加以政治攻势的密切配合，使大部土匪纷纷被击溃或瓦解。如孝感分区领导机关原来只知道全区有六百名土匪，因而产生了麻痹轻敌思想。但在党代表会后，经仔细调查的结果，发现全区股匪散匪达一千余名；麻痹思想打破后，立即进入重点剿匪，一月来除击溃不少股匪外，并争取七股土匪缴枪投降。沔阳分区首先集中力量向盘据鄂湘交界之监利、石首等县之李扩海匪部进剿，经二十天围剿追歼，终于迫使李匪率部二百余投降。在此次胜利影响下，其他大小股匪亦随之动摇瓦解，纷纷向我投降。二十天内即歼匪二千二百余人。大冶分区剿匪与支援前线结合；首先集中力量于武（昌）长（沙）公路，击溃和瓦解匪部四个中队，使公路交通畅通；在较老区则发动群众清剿散匪，打击特务暴动阴谋；远安县并在八月中结合剿匪发展人民武装一百八十余名。其他各地亦在群众性的剿匪运动发动起来之后，进一步组织了各地防匪自卫工作。
    【新华社南昌十八日电】人民解放军江西军区司令部顷发表该省七、八两月剿匪战绩如下：计截止八月十五日止，全部或大部受歼之匪军地方团队十二队，股匪二十九股，投诚股匪及伪乡、保武装六十一股，总计毙、伤、俘及受降匪官兵七千九百名，缴获六零炮、迫击炮一百一十二门，长短枪二万二千九百余只，轻重机枪五百零二挺，各种子弹五十六万七千余发，船六只，马十二匹，及其他武器弹药用品甚多。
