　　Two Thousand Workers and Students
  　Voluntary Labor　Participate in the Reopening of Jianguomen Project
    [This newspaper's report] Two thousand young workers and students in the city, under the organization and leadership of the preparatory committee of the Municipal Communist Youth League, carried out voluntary labor to participate in the construction bureau's project to open up Jianguomen. On the afternoon of the 17th (Saturday), a total of 800 students from Municipal No. 2 Middle School, No. 4 Middle School, Xin Sheng Middle School, Guanghua Girls' Middle School, and the Public Welfare Midwifery School Medical Team labored for three hours, dismantling and transporting 80 cubic meters of city bricks and excavating 100 cubic meters of soil. Yesterday (the 18th), more than 1,200 workers (including some adult workers) from the Ministry of Railways, the Clothing Factory, the 70th Ordnance Factory, the Telecommunications Bureau, and the Xinmin Daily participated in shifts in the morning and afternoon, removing more than 500 cubic meters of soil and dismantling and transporting more than 400 cubic meters of bricks. The youth were enthusiastic about participating in voluntary labor. For example, Municipal No. 2 Middle School only received the notice on the evening of the 16th. On the morning of the 17th, after the school and the CCP branch called for participation, more than half of the students enrolled. Many non-youth workers from the Ministry of Railways also requested to participate. Workers from the Clothing Factory arrived at four o'clock in the morning to participate. Everyone was in high spirits during the work. Although the workers from the Clothing Factory had not eaten breakfast, they were unwilling to go back until 1 p.m. Many students wore out their palms. The Municipal Construction Bureau made a construction plan in advance for this voluntary labor and fully prepared tools and boiled water. The comrades of the preparatory committee of the Municipal Communist Youth League and the engineering personnel of the Construction Bureau formed a general headquarters, which pre-grouped the participating youth into classes, assigned tasks, and organized and directed them in a planned and organized manner, enabling hundreds of people to work simultaneously on the narrow city wall and exert their work efficiency.

  　义务劳动 　 参加重开建国门工程
    【本报讯】平市两千青年工人学生在市青年团筹委会组织领导下，举行义务劳动，参加建设局打通建国门的工程。十七日（星期六）下午，市立二中、四中、新生中学、光华女中及公益助产学校医疗队等共八百同学，劳动了三小时，共拆运城砖八十方，挖土一百方；昨（十八）日，有铁道部、被服厂、七十兵工厂、电信局及新民报等单位工人一千二百余人（其中有一部分成年工人）分上下午轮流劳动，共去土五百余方，拆运砖四百余方。青年们对参加义务劳动情绪热烈，如市立二中在十六日晚方接到通知，十七日上午经校方与中共支部号召，报名参加的超过全校人数的一半，铁道部有许多非青年工人也要求参加。被服厂工人早上四点钟就赶来参加。工作中大家情绪极高，被服厂工人虽然没吃早饭，到了下午一点还不肯回去；许多学生磨破了手掌。市建设局事先为此次义务劳动作出施工计划，并充分预备工具及开水；市青年团筹委会同志与建设局工程人员组成总指挥部，事先将参加青年编组分班，分工动手，有计划、有组织地布置指挥，使数百人能同时在窄窄的城墙上施工，发挥了工作效力。
