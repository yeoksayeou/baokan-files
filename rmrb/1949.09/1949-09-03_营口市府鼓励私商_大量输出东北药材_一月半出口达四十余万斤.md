　　Yingkou City Government Encourages Private Businesses
  　To Export Large Quantities of Northeast Medicinal Materials
  　Exports Reach Over 400,000 Jin in One and a Half Months
    [Yingkou News] In order to reward the large-scale export of local Northeast medicinal materials and develop foreign trade in Yingkou Port, the Yingkou City Government's Bureau of Industry and Commerce held a symposium for Yingkou City mountain product and medicinal material merchants on August 8th. The meeting organized and encouraged medicinal material merchants to export medicinal materials under the dual principles of benefiting farmers and benefiting merchants, in order to exchange for essential goods for Northeast construction and people's lives. The Northeast is known for its local mountain products and medicinal materials, and the vast majority of these products sold both domestically and internationally have been exported through Yingkou Port. Therefore, Yingkou City has ninety-eight mountain product and medicinal material merchants. However, in recent years, due to a lack of contact with Shanghai, Hong Kong, and other places, medicinal material merchants have not understood external market conditions and needs, and have not dared to organize large-scale exports. In order to organize exports in a planned manner, with the support of the government, the merchants temporarily organized the Northeast Mountain Product and Medicinal Material Yingkou Sales Office. The medicinal material merchants sent letters to various places in Shanghai to inquire about market conditions and contact ships, etc. Statistics from July 8th to August 22nd show that a total of 415,546 jin of medicinal materials have been exported, with a value of 8,116,970 Northeast currency. The main medicinal materials exported were red ginseng, deer tail, *Moutong*, *Xixin*, etc. In addition, the Sales Office exported another 200,000 jin of medicinal materials to Shanghai and other places at the end of August, and contacted foreign pharmaceutical merchants in order to export large quantities.

　　营口市府鼓励私商
  　大量输出东北药材
  　一月半出口达四十余万斤
    【营口讯】营口市政府工商局为奖励大量输出东北土产药材，发展营口港对外贸易，于上月八日召开营口市山货药材商座谈会，组织鼓励药材商在对农民有利、药商亦有利的双方兼顾原则下，贩药材出口，换回东北建设及人民生活必需品。东北有名土产山货药材，历年来向国内外推销的绝大部分，都经营口港输出，故营口市有山货药材商九十八户，但年来，由于与上海、香港等地无联系，药材商对外面行情及需要情况不了解，未敢组织大量输出。为了有计划的组织出口，在政府扶助下，药商临时组织了东北山货药材营口推销处，由药材商分别给上海各地去信，询问行情，联络船只等。从七月八日至八月二十二日统计，已输出药材共四一五、五四六斤，价值东北币八一一、六九七万元，输出之主要药材为红参、鹿尾、木通、细莘等。此外，推销处于八月末又输出药材二十万斤，向上海等地推销，并接洽外地药商关系，以便大量输出。
