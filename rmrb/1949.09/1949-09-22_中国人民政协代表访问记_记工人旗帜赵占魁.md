　　Interview with Representatives of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference
  　An Interview with Zhao Zhankui, a Banner of Workers
    Qing Mei, Chen Ji
    "Old Zhao was forged in fire," is the praise the people of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region give to their labor hero Zhao Zhankui. He worked as a hired hand for others from the age of twelve. At the age of thirty-eight, he became a blacksmith in a railway station repair shop. When he heard that Yan'an was the place of the Communist Party, he was extremely excited and asked someone to introduce him. He came to Yan'an. He said to us, "From that time on—at the age of forty-two—I found my home."
    He said that he was later transferred to a farm tool factory to work as a worker guarding a melting furnace. In front of the raging fire, he often worked for twelve hours, sometimes forgetting to eat, rarely resting, and unwilling to ask for leave even when he was sick. Once, he was sick for a whole week, lying in bed. He was very anxious, always thinking about the melting furnace. His apprentice, Li Yougui, took his place, but he had little experience and added too much iron, causing difficulties in melting the iron. After hearing this, he immediately got out of bed, holding a stick, and walked unsteadily to the furnace. When he saw the intense flames again, he was so happy that he forgot his sick body and started working again. However, his constitution was weak and he couldn't stand, so he had to sit on the ground and watch the furnace for a whole day. When the task was completed, he went back to rest with his weak body. One time in June, the weather was dry and hot. When he was melting steel, the crucible suddenly broke, and steel water with a temperature of more than two thousand degrees splashed out, part of it poured on his right foot. The steel water immediately burned his instep into charcoal. He didn't even cry out in pain. When others wanted to take him to the hospital, he refused. He insisted on going to the hospital by himself. When people heard that he was burned, they came to express their sympathy, and the gifts of sympathy filled the table. He donated all the 15,000 yuan of sympathy money to the soldiers at the front, saying, "The soldiers at the front are bleeding and sweating, suffering countless times more than me. What does my burn count for!" When the Kuomintang bandit army launched a large-scale invasion of the border region, his injury had not yet healed. He was angry and determined to be discharged from the hospital. "I want to defend our border region!" Thus, he returned to his work post with his injury.
    He usually actively produced, cared about his fellow workers, loved his apprentices, and could carefully and responsibly seek welfare and set up cooperatives for the workers and manage meals. He never boasted about his contributions. Later, he became a labor hero. In 1943, the Central Trade Union Committee and the Border Region Federation of Trade Unions led the Zhao Zhankui Movement. He became even more modest and worked hard. He once organized the families of twenty workers to learn sand casting, which solved the factory's shortage of sand casting workers, and trained twenty-one female sand casting workers, completing the task of manufacturing landmines to support the front.
    In 1947, the Chiang Kai-shek and Hu Zongnan bandit troops invaded the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region. He led the workers to rush to bury machines and transport materials. After the machines were buried, he said, we will be back. When the enemy crossed Yan'an, he repeatedly requested to join the war. The organization, considering his age, asked him to take the families, children, and elderly of the entire factory to evacuate. At that time, there were no livestock, and the families had difficulty walking, and there were many children. He resolutely made the greatest determination to overcome the difficulties. Although he was already over fifty years old, he still let the families hand him the children, and he took turns carrying them on his back along the way. After a few days, he evacuated the group of five- or six-year-old children to a safe area one by one, and none of the family members were lost. After completing this task, he returned to the factory to work.
    He was elected as a representative of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region to attend the Sixth Labor Congress. Many people welcomed him and learned from him, but he said, "I have nothing. We will only be happy when we work hard, study hard, and the new China is built successfully!"
    Zhao Zhankui, an ordinary worker who was tempered in the fire, is now representing the workers of the Northwest Region to participate in the People's Political Consultative Conference. When the reporter asked him about his thoughts on participating in the CPPCC, he said: "This meeting is a truly democratic and united meeting. The representatives of various democratic parties across the country, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, democratically discussed various proposals for building the country in the future, showing great unity. I participated in the discussions of the nation-building group and realized this even more. Everyone spoke enthusiastically, and the disputes over issues all started from the big interests and the good aspects. This spirit of unity will surely make the People's Political Consultative Conference achieve unprecedented success."
    He said with a firm tone: "The working class, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, has been liberated and has achieved great victory. In the future, our working class will definitely contribute all its strength to build a new China together with the people of the whole country. China has a large population and abundant labor force; we have the technical and material assistance of our Soviet elder brother and various fraternal new democratic countries; and we have the strong and correct leadership of our Chairman Mao and the Communist Party. We are guaranteed to build a new China, and we will definitely be victorious and successful."

　　中国人民政协代表访问记
  　记工人旗帜赵占魁
    庆楣　陈迹
    “老赵是从火里炼出来的”，这是陕甘宁边区的人民给他们的劳动英雄赵占魁的赞语。他从十二岁就给人家当雇工，到了三十八岁，才做了车站修理厂的铁匠，他听说延安是共产党的地方，他兴奋极了，就找人介绍，来到了延安，他对我们说：“我从那时起——四十二岁才找到了自己的家。”
    他说，他后来被调进了农具工厂，当个守熔铁炉的工人，在熊熊的烈火前面，他常常工作到十二个小时，吃饭有时都忘记了，很少休息，有了病也不肯请假。有一次，他病了，一连就是一个礼拜，睡在床上，他很焦急，心里老是记挂着熔铁炉，他的徒弟李有贵代替他工作，经验少，加铁加多了，熔铁有了困难，他听到了之后，马上从床上爬起来，拿着一根棍子，摇摇摆摆的走到了火炉旁，他又看见了强烈的火焰，快乐得顾不了病体，重新工作，但是体质弱，站不住，只好坐在地上，整整的看了一天火炉，等到任务完成了，他带着微弱的身体回去休息。在一个六月的天气里，天干气燥，他熔钢的时候，忽然钳锅坏了，有二千多热度的钢水泼了出来，有一部分浇在他的右脚上，钢水立刻把他的脚面烧成焦炭，他一声也不叫疼，别人要扶他到医院去，他拒绝了，他硬要一个人去进医院。人家听说他烫伤了，都来慰问，慰劳品摆满了桌子，他把人家慰问他的一万五千元慰劳金，全部献给前方战士，他说：“前方战士流血流汗，比我痛苦得不知道有多少倍，我烫伤了算个啥！”当国民党匪军大举进犯边区的时候，他的伤还没有好，他气愤了，他坚决要出院，“我要保卫我们的边区”，这样，他带伤地回到了自己的工作岗位。
    他平常积极生产，关心工友同志，爱护徒弟，能仔细认真负责地为工人谋福利、办合作社、管理伙食，有功劳从不夸耀。后来他成了劳动英雄，一九四三年中央职工委员会及边区总工会，领导展开赵占魁运动。他越发虚心，埋头苦干。他曾经组织了二十个工人家属学习翻砂，解决了工厂缺乏翻砂工的困难，并且训练了二十一个女翻砂工人，完成了制造地雷支援前方的任务。
    一九四七年蒋胡匪军侵入陕甘宁边区，他领导工人群众抢着埋机器，搬运物资，在机器埋好之后，他说，我们还要回来的。敌人越过了延安，他一再要求参战，组织上以他年老，要他带着全厂的家属小孩和老弱的人转移，那时没有牲口，家属们走路困难，小孩又多，他坚决地下了最大决心，克服困难，虽然他已有五十多岁，他还让家属们把小孩交给他，他在路上轮流地背着抱着。几天之后，把那群五六岁的小孩一个个撤退到安全地带，全部家属没有个丢失。他完成了这个任务，又回到工厂工作。
    他被选为陕甘宁边区的代表，出席第六次劳动大会，多少人欢迎他，学习他，他却说：“我没有什么，只要我们好好工作，好好学习，新中国建设成功了那才高兴哩！”
    从一个普通的工人，在烈火中锻炼出来的赵占魁，今天他代表了西北区的工人，来参加人民政协。当记者问到他参加政协的感想时，他说：“这次会议是一个真正民主、团结的会。出席的全国各民主党派代表，在毛主席领导下，民主讨论今后建国大事的各项提案，表现得非常团结。我参加建政小组的讨论，更体会到这点，大家热烈发言，对问题的争执都从大的利益和好的方面出发。这种团结精神，一定会使人民政协得到空前的成功。”
    他带着坚信的口吻说道：“工人阶级在毛主席和共产党领导下，得到解放，得到伟大胜利；今后我们工人阶级一定拿出全部力量来和全国人民共同建设新中国。我们中国人口多，劳动力充足；有咱们苏联老大哥和各新民主主义兄弟国家在技术物质上的帮助；有我们毛主席和共产党的坚强正确的领导，我们建设新中国，一定有保证，一定能胜利成功。”
