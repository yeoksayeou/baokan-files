　　The national regime led by the working class has emerged, and we must step up production to build and consolidate it.
    [News from this newspaper] People from all walks of life in Beiping celebrate the opening of the People's Political Consultative Conference.
    The entire staff of over 300 people from the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory held a grand meeting yesterday (the 22nd) to celebrate the opening of the People's Political Consultative Conference. On the night of the 21st, the factory staff gathered in the factory's auditorium to listen to the news of the opening of the People's Political Consultative Conference and Chairman Mao's speech. Everyone excitedly sang the Internationale and jumped for joy. The entire staff passed a letter to the People's Political Consultative Conference, expressing their determination to build their new China with the working class's new labor enthusiasm and by producing more agricultural machinery.
    After hearing the news of the opening of the People's Political Consultative Conference, all the staff of the Beiping Telephone Bureau No. 2 said: "In the past, the reactionary government of Chiang Kai-shek colluded with imperialism to oppress our people. Now our own government has been born, and the era of imperialism oppressing the Chinese people has come to an end.
    After the news of the opening of the People's Political Consultative Conference reached the Beiping Waterworks Company and the 70th Arsenal, the workers expressed their infinite joy and held separate celebrations. Wang Pingsan, Li Wencheng, Song Qichang and other workers from the Waterworks Company said: The Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference has produced the Central People's Government, which can carry out national construction on a planned and large scale. At the same time, it will further unite international friends and make our construction a success soon. Wei Sheng, a technician from the first institute of the 70th Arsenal, said: In the old society, there was only democracy for a few people, not for our working class. Since the Communist Party led the revolution, the working class has a position. Technician Gan Jixian said: We must not only step up production and develop creativity to build a new China, but also strive to liberate the oppressed people all over the world.
    The Propaganda and Education Department of the 70th Arsenal Trade Union has decided to conduct radio propaganda and big-character poster propaganda in the factory today (23rd) to welcome the People's Political Consultative Conference; the day after tomorrow, street speech teams, Yangko dance teams, singing teams, and street performance teams will be dispatched; the workers themselves will compose music and write scripts to describe the joy of the establishment of their people's motherland. They are currently preparing overnight.
    On the 22nd, after the workers of the Second Clothing Factory heard the news that the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference had opened, they clapped their hands and cheered excitedly, shouting: "So happy!"
    After more than 200 workers from the Fourth Clothing Factory heard the news of the opening of the People's Political Consultative Conference, everyone unanimously expressed their support and excitement. Workers Wang Yongwen and Zhang Laiyi said: "In the old society, who listened to us workers? Look, today many workers have participated in the People's Political Consultative Conference and become representatives." More than 60 workers from the Fourth Factory used their rest time after dinner to happily visit the new atmosphere of Xinhua Gate.

　　工人纷纷举行庆祝会
    工人阶级领导的全国政权出现了，我们要加紧生产，建设它，巩固它。
    【本报讯】北平各界人民欢庆人民政协的开幕。
    华北农业机械总厂全体职工三百余人，于昨日（二十二日），开了一个庆祝人民政协开幕的大会。该厂职工二十一日夜，都欢聚在本厂大礼堂，听人民政协开幕的消息，听毛主席的讲演，大家兴奋的高唱国际歌，高兴的跳起来。全体职工通过给人民政协的信，表示，决以工人阶级新的劳动热忱，更多的生产农业机器，来建设自己的新中国。
    北平电话二局全体职工，听到人民政协开幕的消息后，他们说：“过去的蒋介石反动政府勾结帝国主义来压迫我们人民，现在我们自己的政府诞生了，帝国主义压迫中国人民的时代到了结束的时候了。
    在人民政协开幕的消息传到北平自来水公司和七十兵工厂后，工人们表示无限高兴，分别举行了庆祝会。自来水公司工人王聘三、李文成、宋启昌等说：中国人民政协产生了中央人民政府，就可以有计划地大规模开展全国建设。同时更进一步地团结国际友人，使我们的建设很快成功。七十兵工厂第一所技工魏生说：在旧社会里只有少数人的民主，没有我们工人阶级的民主，自从共产党领导革命，工人阶级才有地位。技工甘绩显说：我们不独要加紧生产，发挥创造，建设新中国，还要进一步为解放全世界被压迫的人民而努力。
    七十兵工厂工会宣教部为了迎接人民政协，定今（二十三）日先在厂内进行广播宣传，和大字报的文字宣传；后天出动街头讲演队、秧歌队、歌咏队、街头演出队；工人们自己编曲编剧，描写自己人民祖国建立的喜悦。现正在连夜准备。
    二十二日，被服二厂的工友们听到了人民政治协商会议召开了的消息后，都兴奋的拍手欢呼，高喊：“快乐极了！”
    被服四厂二百多工友们听到政协开幕的消息后，大家一致表示拥护和兴奋。工人王用文、张来义说：“旧社会里，谁听咱们工人的话，你看今天有好多工人都参加了政协大会，当了代表。”四厂六十多个工友晚饭后利用休息时间，兴高采烈的去看新华门的新气象。他们决定明天早晨集体学习政协消息和毛主席的开幕词。
