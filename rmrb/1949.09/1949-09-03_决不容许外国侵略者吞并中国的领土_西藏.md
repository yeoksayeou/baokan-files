　　Absolutely No Foreign Aggressors Will Be Allowed to Annex China's Territory - Tibet

　　The incident on July 8th, in which the local authorities in Tibet expelled Han Chinese people and Kuomintang personnel stationed in Tibet, was launched under the planning of British and American imperialists and their follower, the Indian Nehru government. The aim of the British, American, and Indian reactionaries in colluding with the reactionary local authorities in Tibet to hold this "anti-communist" incident was to ensure that, at a time when the People's Liberation Army was about to liberate the entire country, the Tibetan people would not only fail to achieve liberation but would further lose their independence and freedom, becoming colonial slaves of foreign imperialism. This conspiracy incident and the recent conspiracy of American imperialism to annex Taiwan are cut from the same cloth. For over a hundred years, British and American imperialism have consistently plotted to invade and annex Tibet. British imperialism first occupied Tibet's outer vassal state of哲孟雄 (Sikkim) in 1860. In 1887 and 1904, it launched wars of aggression against Tibet twice. Since the end of World War II, American imperialism has also been actively plotting to invade Tibet. American imperialism has sent spies to Tibet to engage in activities, striving to gain actual control over Tibet through certain upper-class elements in Tibet. The Chinese people have long paid close attention to the aggressive activities of American, British, and Indian aggressors, and have deeply remembered their crimes of being enemies of the Chinese nation.
    
　　In order to annex Tibet, the British and Indian reactionaries dared to dream of denying that Tibet is a part of Chinese territory. This is an aggressor talking nonsense in broad daylight. No one can find any "basis" by searching through publicly published maps and documents on China's internal affairs and foreign affairs, whether Chinese or foreign. Tibet is Chinese territory. The Tibetan people joined the big family of Chinese nationalities and developed fraternal relations with the Han nationality and other nationalities within China a long time ago. The friendship between the Tibetan nationality and the Han nationality and other nationalities within China has been damaged by British and Indian aggressors and reactionary elements of both the Han and Tibetan nationalities. However, the patriotic people of Tibet are gradually realizing that Mao Zedong's New Democracy and the Chinese Communist Party's and the Chinese People's Liberation Army's policy of supporting minority nationalities are the saviors of the Tibetan people. Any split between any minority nationality in China and the Han people will inevitably lead to them becoming colonial slaves of imperialist countries. The Tibetan people are absolutely unwilling to be colonial slaves. Their heroic resistance against British imperialism's aggression in 1887 and 1904 is the best proof.
    
　　This time, the British and Indian aggressors instigated the local authorities in Tibet to launch a rebellion under the pretext of "anti-communism," attempting to fish in troubled waters, which is an extremely adventurous and stupid thing to do. It is true that the Kuomintang reactionaries should be expelled and eliminated from Chinese soil, but this is a revolutionary struggle conducted by the Chinese people themselves under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, and has nothing to do with any foreign country or any anti-communist elements. The Chinese people have already eliminated the reactionary forces of the Kuomintang in a large part of the country, and in the near future, they will wipe them out completely in the entire country. The Chinese Communist Party is the party of the Chinese working people, and it is the leader of the People's Republic of China. All the Chinese people recognize and trust this leading position of the Chinese Communist Party. Today, whoever opposes the Chinese Communist Party, whoever opposes the Chinese People's Liberation Army, will risk being wiped out like the Kuomintang. The Chinese Communist Party advocates the autonomy of minority nationalities and respects the religious beliefs, cultures, and customs of all nationalities. Anyone who knows the situation in the Inner Mongolia Liberated Area and the Hui nationality areas in Gansu that have been liberated no longer has any doubts. The foreign aggressors spread anti-communist rumors in Tibet in order to deceive and intimidate the Tibetan authorities. Their purpose is to put them in an extremely dangerous position. Is this not clear?
    
　　The more than four million People's Liberation Army led by the Chinese Communist Party must liberate all Chinese nationalities, that is, not only liberate the Han people, but also liberate all minority nationalities within China. The Chinese People's Liberation Army has already liberated most of the Han people and the people of Inner Mongolia, is liberating the Hui people, and will soon liberate the Tibetan people and other nationalities in the Northwest, Southwest, and South China, so that they will forever get rid of the oppression and poor and miserable status of imperialism and the Kuomintang. The Chinese People's Liberation Army must liberate all Chinese territory, including Tibet, Xinjiang, Hainan Island, and Taiwan, and will not allow an inch of land to remain outside the rule of the People's Republic of China. Tibet is Chinese territory, and no foreign aggression is allowed; the Tibetan people are an inseparable part of the Chinese people, and no foreign division is allowed. This is the firm and unwavering policy of the Chinese people, the Chinese Communist Party, and the Chinese People's Liberation Army. Any aggressor who does not recognize this point, who dares to provoke on Chinese territory, and who dares to attempt to divide and invade Tibet and Taiwan, will surely be shattered by the iron fist of the great Chinese People's Liberation Army. We warn these aggressors to stop immediately in the face of Tibet and Taiwan, otherwise they must bear full responsibility for all the consequences caused by their actions.

### 决不容许外国侵略者吞并中国的领土——西藏

　　决不容许外国侵略者吞并中国的领土——西藏
    七月八日西藏地方当权者驱逐汉族人民及国民党驻藏人员的事件，是在英美帝国主义及其追随者印度尼赫鲁政府的策划下发动的。英、美、印反动派勾结西藏地方反动当局举行这个“反共”事变的目的，就是企图在人民解放军即将解放全国的时候，使西藏人民不但不能得到解放，而且进一步地丧失独立自由，变为外国帝国主义的殖民地奴隶。这一个阴谋事变和最近美帝国主义妄图吞并台湾的阴谋是同出一辙。一百多年来英美帝国主义就一贯地图谋侵略和吞并西藏。英帝国主义在一八六○年首先侵占了西藏的外藩哲孟雄（即锡金）。一八八七年和一九○四年又两度发动过侵略西藏的战争。美帝国主义自第二次世界大战结束之后，亦积极图谋侵略西藏。美帝国主义曾派遣间谍到西藏活动，力图经过西藏的若干上层分子，取得对西藏的实际统治权。中国人民对于美、英、印侵略者的侵略活动早已予以密切注意，而且深深地记取了他们这种与中华民族为敌的罪行。
    英、印反动派为了吞并西藏，竟敢妄想否认西藏是中国领土的一部分，这是侵略者在白昼说梦话。任何人找遍中外公开出版的地图和关于中国内政外交的文件也无法找出任何的“根据”。西藏是中国的领土，西藏民族加入中国各民族的大家庭，与汉族及中国境内其他民族发生兄弟的关系，已有悠久的历史。西藏民族与汉族及中国境内其他各民族的友谊，曾经受过英、印侵略者和汉藏两族反动分子的损害。但是西藏的爱国人民正在逐步地认识到，毛泽东的新民主主义及中国共产党和中国人民解放军扶助少数民族的政策，乃是西藏人民的救星。中国的任何少数民族与汉族人民的分裂，必将沦为帝国主义国家的殖民地奴隶，西藏人民是决不愿做殖民地奴隶的，他们在一八八七年和一九○四年两次英勇抗击英帝国主义的侵略，就是最好的证明。
    这次英、印侵略者嗾使西藏地方当局，以“反共”作为借口，发动变乱，企图泥水摸鱼，更是极端冒险的蠢事。不错，国民党反动派是应该从中国土地上驱逐和消灭的，但这是中国人民自己在中国共产党领导下所进行的革命斗争，与任何外国无干，与任何反共分子无干。中国人民已经在很大部分的土地上消灭了国民党反动势力，而且不久的将来，就会在全部国土内把他们扫荡得干干净净。中国共产党是中国劳动人民的政党，是中华人民共和国的领导者，全中国人民都公认和信赖中国共产党的这种领导地位。在今天，谁要反对中国共产党、谁要反对中国人民解放军，谁就要冒和国民党一样被扫灭的危险。中国共产党是主张少数民族的自治，尊重各民族的宗教信仰文化习惯的，凡是知道内蒙解放区和甘肃已解放的回民区情形的人，已经不再有怀疑了。外国侵略者在西藏散布反共的谣言，借以欺骗恐吓西藏当局，其目的是想使他们陷于极端危险的地步，这难道还不明白吗？
    中国共产党所领导的四百余万的人民解放军必须解放中国各民族，即不但解放汉族人民，而且解放中国境内各少数民族人民。中国人民解放军，已经解放了大多数汉族人民和内蒙古人民，正在解放着回族人民，并即将解放藏族和西北、西南、华南其他各族人民，使他们永远摆脱帝国主义和国民党的压迫和穷困悲惨的地位。中国人民解放军必须解放包括西藏、新疆、海南岛、台湾在内的中国全部领土，不容有一寸土地被留在中华人民共和国的统治以外。西藏是中国的领土，绝不容许任何外国侵略；西藏人民是中国人民的一个不可分离的组成部分，绝不容许任何外国分割。这是中国人民、中国共产党和中国人民解放军的坚定不移的方针。任何侵略者如果不认识这一点，如果敢于在中国领土上挑衅，如果敢于妄想分割和侵略西藏和台湾，他就一定要在伟大的中国人民解放军的铁拳之前碰得头破血流。我们警告这些侵略分子立即在西藏和台湾的面前止步，否则他们就必须担负他们这种行为所引起的一切后果的全部责任。
