[Beijing News] In order to convey the spirit of the People's Representatives Conference and discuss how to implement the resolutions of the conference in practical work, the Municipal People's Government Health Bureau convened a meeting of all cadres and representatives of its affiliated units on the morning of August 27th. Director Zhang conveyed the resolutions of the conference. He first categorized the proposals related to the Health Bureau's work into four types and proposed preliminary implementation measures: (1) Regarding strengthening medical facilities in suburban areas and establishing hospitals in factories and mines, based on the current situation, efforts can be made to open four medical cooperatives in suitable locations in the suburbs in October, adopting a public-private partnership approach. If the pilot projects are successful, they can be widely promoted. At the same time, the second mobile medical team has been established to provide free medical services in the suburbs (mainly the more difficult western and northern suburbs). In principle, large enterprises and factories will handle their own hospitals, with the Health Bureau providing technical assistance. In addition, the Health Bureau plans to work with the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions to select suitable locations to establish hospitals or clinics for other workers and scattered laborers. (2) Regarding maternal and child health care, future efforts will focus on strengthening school health in primary schools and kindergartens, conducting surveys and statistics on maternal and infant mortality, and piloting health checks for children (the first step is to conduct checks on infants delivered by the Health Bureau's health centers). (3) Regarding medical and health management education, scientific methods will be taught to traditional midwives and dental technicians, and the management of pharmaceutical merchants will be strengthened. (4) In terms of environmental hygiene: Future efforts should focus on "reducing waste and increasing resources" in garbage disposal. He also conveyed general resolutions, calling for strict implementation of thrift. After the meeting, all cadres and representatives of various units were divided into six groups to conduct heated discussions on how to implement the resolutions of the People's Representatives Conference in a planned manner after the meeting.
