Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 14th: To overcome the disconnection between industrial production and sales, the Northeast People's Government's Department of Commerce and Department of Industry are trialing the implementation of production and sales contracts. The managers of the two departments began discussing this matter in late August. However, given that the signing of a comprehensive production and sales contract between the two departments requires resolving a series of issues for each production unit under the Department of Industry, such as raw material supply, cost accounting, product quality standardization, and reasonable calculation of market prices and sales prices, it was decided that the various companies under the Enterprise Bureau of the Department of Industry and the Northeast Department Store Corporation would first negotiate and sign production and sales contracts, with the managers of the two departments directly participating. After 20 days of consultation, a production and sales contract has now been signed between the Paper, Rubber, and Ceramics Companies under the Enterprise Bureau and the Department Store Corporation. In the contract, both parties mutually guarantee the timely supply of products and timely sales to accelerate the turnover of industrial funds. The contract stipulates the quality, quantity, specifications, packaging conditions, delivery time, and location of the products. The Department Store Corporation may refuse to accept goods that do not meet the specified conditions. The Department Store Corporation guarantees to assume full sales responsibility after receiving goods that meet the regulations, and actively promote the goods according to the pre-determined sales plan and market conditions. In the past, due to the absence of contracts, there were no specific regulations on product quality, specifications, etc. Some products had no packaging or containers, and some factory products had not even completed the entire production process, which caused difficulties in sales work. In addition, the Department of Commerce did not pay enough attention to the sales of state-owned industrial products before July, resulting in a backlog of products. The signing of the contract not only strengthens the connection between production and sales but also clearly stipulates the responsibilities of the production and sales departments, thus guaranteeing the overcoming of the disconnection between industrial production and sales.

　　克服工业品产销脱节现象
  　东北工商部门试订产销合同
    【新华社沈阳十四日电】东北人民政府商业部与工业部正试订产销合同，以克服工业品的产销脱节现象。此事工、商两部经理处于八月下旬即开始洽商，但鉴于两部全面产销合同的签订，须待工业部所属各生产单位的有关原料供给、成本核算、产品质量的标定、市场价格与出售价格的合理计算等一系列问题求得解决后，才易于实行，因此决定先由工业部企业局所属各公司与东北百货总公司先行商订产销合同，由两部经理处直接参加。经二十天的磋商，现已签订了一个企业局所属造纸、橡胶、陶瓷三公司与百货总公司之间的产销合同。在合同中双方互相保证产品的按期供应、及时推销，以加速工业资金的周转。合同规定了产品的质量、数量、规格、包装条件及交货的时间、地点等，不合规定条件的商品，百货总公司可拒绝接受；百货总公司则保证在收到合乎规定的商品后，负起全部推销责任，按照预定的推销计划及市场情况积极地把商品推销出去。按过去由于没有合同，产品的质量、规格等无具体规定，某些产品没有包装、容器，甚至一部分出厂产品没有完成全部生产过程，因之造成了推销工作中的困难。再加上商业部在七月份以前对国营工业产品的推销工作注意不够，致造成产品积压现象。合同的签订，不仅加强了产销联系，并且明确规定了生产部门和推销部门的职责，因而工业品产销脱节现象的克服，就有了保证。
