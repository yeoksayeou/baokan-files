　　The CPC Chahar Provincial Committee
  　Calls for Strengthening Railway Protection Work
    [This newspaper dispatch] Recently, incidents of theft of railway ties, wires, and spikes have been continuously occurring on railways within Chahar Province. In order to protect the people's railways, the CPC Chahar Provincial Committee issued instructions on August 30th, calling on the people of the entire province to strengthen railway protection work. The main points of the instructions are as follows:
    1. Mobilize the entire Party and all the people to cherish the railways. County, district committees, and branches must educate the broad masses to correctly understand that the railways belong to the people themselves and must be cherished and protected by the people themselves. Regular inspections and supervision should be carried out to ensure that state property is not lost or damaged.
    2. Villages and towns within ten to fifteen li along the railway line should organize militia railway protection teams by administrative village, with railway protection groups established under them, selecting the most outstanding militiamen. Divide into sections and conduct irregular patrols along the line, protecting the railways and bridges in a planned and focused manner, and establish a meeting whistle system.
    3. Combine armed railway protection with the elimination of traitors and the clearing of special agents. The militia captain of the villages and towns within the aforementioned scope concurrently serves as the railway protection team leader. The village public security officer concurrently serves as the railway protection team instructor. Hold regular meetings to inspect, discuss, and arrange railway protection work.
    4. In order to strengthen railway protection work, the public security bureaus, armed forces departments, railway public security sections, or public security outposts along the railway line should jointly form a railway protection committee, establish a regular meeting system, and discuss and arrange comprehensive railway protection work for the railways and the local areas. Regularly exchange intelligence and detect saboteurs. The railway protection team can arrest saboteurs caught in the act and send them to the district and then the county for handling along with the evidence.
    5. In order to mobilize the masses to protect the railways, create a mass railway protection movement, and ensure that the railway protection movement can continue, attention should be paid to cultivating collective or individual models in railway protection and giving them timely and appropriate commendations and rewards.
    6. Railway protection groups, railway protection teams, all militiamen, and railway line employees, public security sections and outposts, and investigators all have the right to strictly inspect those carrying or selling copper, iron, wire, and railway equipment and investigate their source. If there is no official certificate or the origin is unknown, send them to the local government for handling. Those who steal or specialize in buying stolen materials and special agents who sabotage should be dealt with according to the severity of their actions. Oppose hastily handling cases without asking about the circumstances or the so-called "mass viewpoint" of "pitying the poor." Local governments should strictly prohibit wholesale and private businesses and copper manufacturing industries from buying or using copper wire to make copperware, or using railway spikes and fishplates to forge ironware. Problems that have already occurred should be investigated and dealt with.

　　中共察哈尔省委
  　号召加强护路工作
    【本报讯】近来察哈尔省境内铁路，不断发生盗窃枕木、电线及道钉等事情，中共察哈尔省省委为保护人民的铁路，特于八月三十日发出指示，号召全省人民加强护路工作。指示要点如下：
    一、全党全民动员起来爱护铁路。县、区委及支部，必须教育广大群众，使之正确认识铁路是人民自己的，必须由人民自己爱护，保护。并经常检查督促，以确保国家财产不受损失或破毁。
    二、沿铁路线十到十五里内之村镇，以行政村为单位，组织民兵护路队，下设护路小组，选拔最优秀之民兵组成。划分段落，有计划有重点的不定期的进行巡线，护路，护桥，并建立会哨制度。
    三、武装护路与除奸清特相结合。在上述范围内之村镇民兵队长兼护路队长。村公安员兼护路队指导员。定期开会检查，讨论布置护路工作。
    四、为了加强护路工作，由沿铁路线之公安局、武装部、铁路公安段，或公安分驻所共同组成护路委员会，建立定期会议制度，讨论布置铁路及地方的全面护路工作。并经常交换情报，侦缉破坏分子。对破坏分子中之现行犯，护路队可加逮捕，连同证件送区转县处理。
    五、为发动群众护路，造成群众护路运动，使护路运动能坚持下去，应注意培养护路中集体或个人的模范，并及时适当地给予表扬奖励。
    六、护路小组、护路队、全体民兵及铁路沿线之职工、公安段、所、纠查队员均有权对携带或贩卖铜铁电线及铁路器材者之严格检查，追究来源。如未有机关证明或来历不明者，送当地政府处理。对偷割或专收买小偷之偷盗器材及特务破坏分子要分别轻重处理。反对不问情况草率处理或“怜惜穷人”的所谓“群众观点”。各地政府对分营商业及私营商业，铜器制造业，要严格禁止收买或以铜线制造铜器，以铁路之道钉、夹板打造铁器。对已发生之问题应加追究处理。
