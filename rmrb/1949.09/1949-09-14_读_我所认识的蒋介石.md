　　Reading "The Chiang Kai-shek I Knew"
　　Ma Zong
　　I recently read a book written by Mr. Feng Yuxiang, "The Chiang Kai-shek I Knew." From the preface, I learned that it was dictated by Mr. Feng and recorded by his wife, Ms. Li Dequan. This book, only published in March of this year, is probably Mr. Feng Yuxiang's last posthumous work.
　　Mr. Feng knew very well the private secrets and shameless deeds of Chiang Kai-shek. In "The Chiang Kai-shek I Knew," Mr. Feng exposed these historical facts one by one. He told us how Chiang Kai-shek betrayed Mr. Sun Yat-sen's revolution, how he was dictatorial and brutal, how he opposed national salvation and surrendered to imperialism, how he learned from Yuan Shikai and wanted to be emperor, how he constantly colluded with Japan during the Anti-Japanese War while concentrating his elite weapons in the Northwest to deal with the truly anti-Japanese Communist Party, how he falsely claimed peace and political consultation while secretly expanding his special agent conspiracies, how he made a fortune by looting after Japan's surrender and poisoned the people in the occupied areas, how he wantonly raped, plundered, and massacred the people during the civil war, how he usurped the political power of the Chinese people, how he scraped the blood and sweat of the Chinese people to offer to his foreign masters and enrich his reactionary and corrupt clique, and how he used fascist special agent methods to destroy thousands of patriotic youths.
　　In the past, in the areas ruled by Chiang Kai-shek, many people did not understand these things. They were fooled by Chiang Kai-shek and his secret agent politics, thinking that "Chiang Kai-shek himself is not bad, it's just the people around him who are bad," and some even thought that "at least Chiang Kai-shek led the eight-year War of Resistance and that was meritorious." But what are the facts? The facts show that these are all muddled, parrot-like, and foolish views. Mr. Feng Yuxiang's words once again broke through the sealed jar and exposed these lies.
　　We admire Mr. Feng Yuxiang's patriotic sense of justice. He did not collude with Chiang Kai-shek, and finally changed his mild and passive attitude towards Chiang Kai-shek, bravely raised the banner of anti-Chiang, and moved towards the side of the people. As a person who "started as a soldier at the age of twelve and spent fifty-five years as a soldier," after experiencing many twists and turns, he finally found the true light, which is really not a simple thing. However, Mr. Feng Yuxiang has passed away, and he did not have time to further improve his understanding and insights. Therefore, in his book, there are inevitably many old and incorrect views, such as the one-sided views on American imperialism and various factions of warlords and bureaucrats within the Kuomintang, as well as some events. Of course, we should understand the process of Mr. Feng Yuxiang's ideological transformation and the influence of the objective environment, and not demand too much; but readers should and must have a critical eye when reading it.

　　读“我所认识的蒋介石”
    马宗
    最近看了一本冯玉祥先生著的“我所认识的蒋介石”，从绪言上知道是由冯先生口述，他的夫人李德全先生笔录下来的。这本书，今年三月才出版，大概要算是冯玉祥先生的最后遗著了。
    冯先生对于蒋介石的阴私秘密无耻勾当是一清二楚的，在“我所认识的蒋介石”一书中，冯先生就把这些历史的事实一一暴露出来。他告诉了我们，蒋介石是如何地背叛孙中山先生的革命，是如何地独裁残暴，是如何地反对救国、投降帝国主义，是如何地学习袁世凯想做皇帝，是如何地在抗日时期一面不断勾结日本，一面把精锐的武器集中在西北对付真正抗日的共产党，是如何地假言和平、假作政治协商、背地却扩大特务阴谋活动，是如何地在日本投降之后大发其劫收横财毒害沦陷区的老百姓，是如何地在内战中大肆奸淫掳掠屠杀人民，是如何地篡夺中国人民的政权，是如何地刮尽中国人民的血汗去供献他的外国主子和养肥他的反动腐化集团，是如何地使用法西斯特务手段摧残了千千万万的爱国青年。
    过去，在蒋介石统治的区域里面，有许多人是不明白这些的，他们受了蒋介石和他的特务政治的愚弄，以为“蒋介石本人并不坏，坏的只是他左右的人”，甚至还有一些人以为“至少蒋介石领导了八年抗战是有功劳的”。但是事实怎么样呢？事实就说明了这些都是稀里糊涂、人云亦云、愚蠢的看法；冯玉祥先生的话又再度地击坡了闷葫芦，戳穿了这些谎话。
    冯玉祥先生的爱国正义感，我们是敬佩的。他并没有和蒋介石同流合污，并且终于改变了对蒋介石温和消极的态度，勇敢地揭起了反蒋的旗帜，走向人民的一方面来。作为一个“十二岁开始当兵，做了五十五年丘八”的人，经历了许多弯弯曲曲的路程，毕竟找到了真正的光明，这实在是一件不简单的事。但是冯玉祥先生是逝世了，他没有来得及使自己的认识和见解更加提高一步，因此在他的书中也不可避免地存在着不少旧的和不正确的观点，如表现在对于美帝国主义和对于国民党中各派军阀官僚及一些事件的片面的看法等等。当然，我们应该了解冯玉祥先生思想转变的过程和客观环境的影响，不能求之过高；但读书的人，是应该并且必须具有批判的眼光来读它。
