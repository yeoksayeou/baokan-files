Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 22nd: Dong Biwu, representing the Preparatory Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) Fourth Group, delivered a "Report on the Drafting Process and Basic Content of the Organic Law of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China" at the second day of the CPPCC plenary session. Dong Biwu first reported on the drafting process, saying:

　　The group leader, deputy group leaders, and members totaled twenty-five people. Representatives from twenty-three units participating in the Preparatory Committee, except for democratic figures from the cultural circles, participated. The first group plenary meeting was held on June 18th, where opinions were widely exchanged, and seven people, including Zhang Zhirang, were elected to prepare a discussion outline. On July 8th, the second group plenary meeting discussed the "Basic Issues in the Government Organic Law" proposed by the drafting committee based on the outline. Basic opinions tended to be consistent, and Dong Biwu, Zhang Xiruo, Yan Baohang, Wang Kunlun, Zhang Zhirang, and others were designated to be responsible for drafting the initial draft of the Government Organic Law. The drafting committee held three meetings successively and consulted experts such as Qian Duansheng, Wang Zhixiang, and Deng Chumin, and wrote the initial draft of the Government Organic Law. On August 17th, the third group plenary meeting was convened to revise and approve the preliminary draft of the Organic Law, which was submitted to the Standing Committee of the Preparatory Committee of the New CPPCC. On August 27th, the fourth Standing Committee meeting designated Huang Yanpei, Ma Xulun, Zhang Xiruo, Li Lisan, and myself to further study and revise the preliminary draft once more. On September 13th, the fifth Standing Committee meeting made textual modifications to the "Draft of the Organic Law of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China." On September 17th, the second plenary meeting of the Preparatory Committee of the New CPPCC adopted it in principle.

　　Dong Biwu then explained several issues regarding the draft of the Organic Law. He said:

　　1. The Issue of the Name of the State: We adopted the name People's Republic of China because the "Republic" clarifies our form of government. The term "People" in today's New Democratic China refers to the working class, the peasant class, the petty bourgeoisie, and the national bourgeoisie. It has a definite explanation, which has already expressed the meaning of the people's democratic dictatorship. There is no need to repeat the word "democracy" once more.

　　2. The Issue of the Nature of the State: The state is a tool for the ruling class to suppress the ruled class, so the relationship between classes in today's people's democratic dictatorship must be clarified. The leadership of the working class, based on the alliance of workers and peasants and the alliance of four classes, is the characteristic of China's New Democracy, which everyone has agreed upon.

　　3. The Principles of Government Organization: This principle is democratic centralism, which is specifically manifested as a government of the People's Congress system. That is, the organs through which the people exercise state power are the People's Congresses at all levels and the People's Governments at all levels. The People's Congresses at all levels are produced by the people through universal suffrage. The People's Congresses at all levels elect the People's Governments at all levels. During the adjournment of the People's Congresses at all levels, the People's Governments at all levels are the organs for exercising the power of each level. The highest organ of state power is the National People's Congress. During the adjournment of the National People's Congress, the Central People's Government is the highest organ for exercising state power. The principle of democratic centralism is the opposite of the principle of separation of powers of old democracy. The parliamentary system of the old democracy is that the part of the bourgeoisie in power allows another part of the minority, the so-called opposition, to speak empty words on the conference stage, while the powerful hold the administrative power tightly, doing work that is beneficial to their own rule. This is a deceptive democratic system created by the exploiting classes playing tricks in front of the broad masses of people, dividing up the spoils and private interests. The judiciary is independent in name, but in essence, it also serves the class in power. We don't want this set of things. Our system is the unity of deliberation and execution, a government where all power is concentrated in the People's Congress.

　　4. Before the convocation of the National People's Congress elected by universal suffrage, the plenary session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, that is, this meeting, shall exercise the functions and powers of the National People's Congress, elect the Central People's Government Committee of the People's Republic of China, and entrust it with the functions and powers of exercising state power. After the Central People's Government Committee is elected, the National Committee elected by the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference will become the consultation organ of various parties and people's organizations outside the state power.

　　5. The draft Organic Law of the Government stipulates that the Central People's Government Committee has ten functions and powers, representing the People's Republic of China externally and leading the state power internally.

　　6. The draft Organic Law of the Government stipulates that the Central People's Government Committee shall organize the Government Administration Council, which is the highest executive organ of state administration; and organize the People's Revolutionary Military Commission, which is the highest command organ of state military affairs; and organize the Supreme People's Court and the Supreme People's Procuratorate.

　　Next, Dong Biwu explained several individual issues regarding the organization and functions of the Central People's Government Committee. Dong Biwu said that the draft stipulates that the Central People's Government Committee shall be composed of one chairman, several vice-chairmen, and several members elected by the plenary session of the CPPCC, and a secretary-general mutually elected by the Government Committee. There is no Standing Committee, and the person in charge of the Government Administration Council is called the Premier.

　　The Central People's Government Committee, based on the proposal of the Government Administration Council, shall appoint and remove or approve the appointment and removal of the chairmen, vice-chairmen, and major administrative personnel of the People's Governments of major administrative regions and provinces and cities. Here, the phrase "approve the appointment and removal" is used because if the chairmen and vice-chairmen of some administrative regions and provinces and cities are elected, the Central People's Government will only approve their appointment.

　　Dong Biwu finally talked about the organizational structure of the Government Administration Council. According to the draft Organic Law of the Government, the Government Administration Council shall be composed of one Premier, several Vice-Premiers, one Secretary-General, and several members of the Government Affairs Committee appointed by the Central People's Government Committee. Members of the Government Affairs Committee may concurrently serve as ministers of various ministries and chairmen of various committees. The Premier of the Government Administration Council presides over the affairs of the entire Government Administration Council, and the Vice-Premiers and Secretary-General of the Government Administration Council assist the Premier in performing their duties. The Government Administration Council shall establish a Political and Legal Committee, a Financial and Economic Committee, a Cultural and Educational Committee, a People's Supervision Committee, and thirty ministries, commissions, academies, administrations, and banks. The above four committees are respectively responsible for guiding the ministries, commissions, academies, administrations, and banks related to their work. In this regard, Dong Biwu explained:

　　1. Members of the Government Affairs Committee may concurrently serve as ministers of various ministries and chairmen of various committees, which means that ministers and chairmen are not necessarily members of the Government Affairs Committee. Under our Government Administration Council, there are thirty ministries, commissions, academies, administrations, and banks. If their heads are all members of the Government Affairs Committee, plus members of the Government Affairs Committee who do not manage departments, then the number of members of the Government Affairs Committee will be too large, and the Government Affairs Council will not be easy to hold well.

　　2. The three committees of Political and Legal Affairs, Financial and Economic Affairs, and Cultural and Educational Affairs are listed as first-level in order to assist the Government Administration Council in connecting and guiding the work of the relevant departments. The work of each department is subject to dual leadership, that is, on the one hand, it is subject to the leadership of the Government Administration Council, and on the other hand, it is subject to the leadership of its affiliated steering committee.

　　3. The People's Supervision Committee is to supervise whether administrative personnel are performing their duties. It is different from the Procuratorate. Being subordinate to the Government Administration Council is more able to be close to the administrative organs than directly subordinate to the Central People's Committee, familiar with the actual situation, and convenient for performing duties.

　　4. There are a total of thirty specialized administrative departments under the Government Administration Council because our People's Republic should turn to construction, and we must set up more departments to manage financial and economic work. We have stipulated in the draft that the Central People's Government Committee may decide to increase, decrease, or merge the committees, ministries, commissions, academies, administrations, banks, and halls of the Government Administration Council when necessary. With such flexible provisions, the government will be able to handle affairs well.

　　董必武报告：中华人民共和国中央人民政府组织法草拟的经过及基本内容
    【新华社北平二十二日电】中国人民政协全体会议第二日，董必武代表人民政协筹备会第四小组作了“关于草拟中华人民共和国中央人民政府组织法的经过及其基本内容的报告”。董必武首先报告起草经过说：
    本组组长、副组长和组员一共二十五人，参加筹备会的二十三个单位，除了文化界民主人士以外，均有代表参加。六月十八日举行第一次小组全体会，广泛的交换了意见，并推举张志让等七人准备讨论提纲。七月八日本小组第二次全体会议就根据提纲起草委员会所提“政府组织法中的基本问题”进行讨论，基本意见趋于一致，并推定了董必武、张奚若、阎宝航、王昆仑、张志让等五人负责起草政府组织法的初步草案。起草委员会先后开会三次，并征询了钱端升、王之相、邓初民等专家的意见，写成了政府组织法的草案初稿，又于八月十七日召开本小组第三次全体会议，修正通过了组织法的初步草案，提交新政协筹备会的常务委员会。八月廿七日第四次常会指定了黄炎培、马叙伦、张奚若、李立三和本人对初步草案再研究修改一次。九月十三日第五次常务委员会对“中华人民共和国中央人民政府组织法草案”作文字修改后，在九月十七日新政协筹备会第二次全体会议中作了原则的通过。
    董必武继对组织法草案的几个问题加以说明。他说：
    一、国家名称问题：我们采用了中华人民共和国这个名称，因为共和国说明了我们的国体，“人民”二字在今天新民主主义的中国是指工人阶级、农民阶级、小资产阶级和民族资产阶级，它有确定的解释，这已经把人民民主专政的意思表达出来，不必再把“民主”二字重复一次了。
    二、国家属性问题：国家是统治阶级镇压被统治阶级的工具，所以必须把今天人民民主专政中阶级间的关系讲清楚。工人阶级领导，以工农联盟为基础和四个阶级的联盟，是中国新民主主义的特质，这是大家所同意了的。
    三、政府组织的原则：这个原则是民主集中制，它具体的表现是人民代表大会制的政府。即人民行使国家政权的机关为各级人民代表大会和各级人民政府。各级人民代表大会由人民用普选方法产生之。各级人民代表大会选举各级人民政府。各级人民代表大会闭会期间，各级人民政府为行使各级政权的机关。国家最高政权机关为全国人民代表大会。全国人民代表大会闭会期间，中央人民政府为行使国家政权的最高机关。民主集中制的原则，与旧民主主义三权分立的原则相反。旧民主主义的议会制度是资产阶级中当权的一部分人容许另一部分的少数人，所谓反对派，在会议讲台上去说空话，而当权者则紧握着行政权柄，干有利于本身统治的工作。这是剥削阶级在广大人民面前玩弄手腕，分取赃私，干出来一种骗人的民主制度。司法名义上是独立，实质上同样是为当权的阶级服务的。我们不要这一套，我们的制度是议行合一的，是一切权力集中于人民代表大会的政府。
    四、在普选的全国人民代表大会召开以前，由中国人民政治协商会议的全体会议，即本会议，执行全国人民代表大会的职权，选举中华人民共和国中央人民政府委员会，并付之以行使国家权力的职权。中央人民政府委员会选出后，人民政治协商会议选出的全国委员会即成为国家政权以外各党派各人民团体的协议机关。
    五、政府组织法草案规定中央人民政府委员会有十项职权，对外代表中华人民共和国，对内领导国家政权。
    六、政府组织法草案规定中央人民政府委员会组织政务院，为国家政务的最高执行机关；并组织人民革命军事委员会，为国家军事的最高统辖机关；组织最高人民法院和最高人民检察署。
    接着，董必武说明关于中央人民政府委员会的组织和职权的若干个别问题。董必武说，草案规定中央人民政府委员会，由人民政协全体会议选举主席一人，副主席若干人，委员若干人，并由政府委员会互选秘书长一人组成。不设常务委员会，政务院的主管人员称为总理。
    中央人民政府委员会，依据政务院的提议，任免或批准任免各大行政区及各省市人民政府的主席、副主席及主要的行政人员。这里，用“批准任免”的字样，因为有的行政区和省市的人民政府，其主席、副主席如果是选举出来的，则中央人民政府只批准其任命。
    董必武最后说到政务院的组织问题，按照政府组织法草案，政务院由中央人民政府委员会任命总理一人，副总理若干人，秘书长一人，政务委员若干人组成之。政务委员得兼任各部的部长及各委员会的主任委员。政务院总理主持政务院全院事宜，政务院副总理及秘书长协助总理执行职务。政务院设政治法律委员会、财政经济委员会、文化教育委员会、人民监察委员会及三十个部、会、院、署、行。上述四个委员会分别负责指导与其工作有关的部、会、院、署、行。对此，董必武解释称：
    一、政务委员得兼任各部部长及各委员会主任，这就是说，部长和主任委员不一定是政务委员。我们政务院下有三十个部、会、院、署、行，如果他们的首长都是政务委员再加不管部的政务委员则政务委员人数太多，政务会议也就不易开好。
    二、政法、财经、文教等三个委员会列为一级，以便协助政务院，联系和指导有关的各部门工作。各部门的工作受双重领导，即一方面受政务院的领导，另一方面又受其所属的指导委员会的领导。
    三、人民监察委员会是监察行政人员是否履行其职责的，与检察署不同，隶属政务院比直接隶属于中央人民委员会更能与行政机关接近，熟习实际情况，便于执行职务。
    四、政务院下设的专管行政部门共有三十个，这因为我们的人民共和国应转向建设，不能不多设几个部门去管财政经济的工作。我们在草案中规定中央人民政府委员会对于政务院的各委、部、会、院、署、行、厅于必要时得决议增加减少或合并之的规定，有了这样有弹性的条文，政府便好办事了。
