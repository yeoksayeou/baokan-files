Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 12th: TASS Moscow, 11th: Marinin, in a commentary in Pravda on international affairs, commented on the "Washington Negotiations" between the United States, Britain, and Canada, stating: It is said that the main purpose of the Washington trilateral talks is to resolve various issues related to the severe economic crisis in Britain. Only the simple-minded would believe this. In reality, the convening of the above meeting was prompted by the desire of the American ruling circles to implement measures aimed at weakening and containing the development of the American economic crisis. In fact, the aggravation of the British crisis is not only inextricably linked with the development of the American economic crisis, but is also being exploited by the American ruling circles in every possible way to complete the task of seizing the important levers of the British economy along with the entire British Empire.

The aim of the Wall Street plan is, first, to make the pound subordinate to the dollar, thereby turning the dollar into a monopolistic international currency that dominates the entire capitalist world. Second, the United States is persistently seeking to reduce or even eliminate the tariffs that exist in Britain and other countries that import American goods. Third, the United States is fighting to eliminate the so-called "Sterling Area." Finally, Wall Street has put on the agenda the issue of large-scale American capital investment not only in so-called backward regions but also in Britain and other Western European countries.

Thus, in view of the increasingly serious American economic crisis, the aim of the American ruling circles is, on the one hand, to create a war psychosis and hysteria, promote an arms race and universal rampant militarism, and promote an adventurous policy of "cold war" against the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries. On the other hand, this plan also stipulates a larger-scale offensive by American capital against Marshall Plan countries, mainly Britain, which is bound to lead to a further sharp decline in the living standards of the working class and the intensification of capitalist exploitation.

Wall Street is launching an offensive against Britain, using not only verbal intimidation but also economic sanctions. The fact that the Marshall Plan allocated six hundred million dollars less to Britain than requested is indeed one such method. In addition, in order to make London yield, Washington is organizing France, Belgium, and Italy, Marshall Plan countries, into an anti-British group. Since France, Belgium, and Italy did not directly participate in the trilateral talks, according to reports, the anti-British group will apparently appear at the International Monetary Fund meeting scheduled to open on September 13. This struggle between Britain and the United States has intensified the contradictions within the entire Marshall Plan camp. Wall Street makes its Western European vassal states fight each other, which allows it to intensify its control over each vassal state separately. This is, in fact, the notorious Western European "unification" based on American foundations.

Speaking of the Labor government's attitude towards American demands (these demands will cause countless difficulties for the British working people), Marinin pointed out that Attlee, Bevin, and Cripps find it difficult to offer significant resistance to American orders. However, open surrender would cause huge disputes at home and would greatly undermine the Labor Party's election plans, because the British working people are increasingly dissatisfied with the policy of subservience and flattery of the dollar pursued by the British ruling circles. That is why the Labor government is playing tricks and engaging in behind-the-scenes bargaining with the American ruling circles to win various individual minor concessions that can ultimately disguise the secret agreement that is being prepared.

Marinin emphasized in conclusion that no matter what unreliable compromises and behind-the-scenes intrigues the participants in this play use, they will not be able to eliminate the deep and increasingly acute contradictions between the United States and Britain.

　　美帝图摆脱经济危机逼迫英镑从属于美元
　  真理报评华盛顿谈判
    【新华社北平十二日电】塔斯社莫斯科十一日讯：马里宁在真理报的国际述评中评论美英加三国的“华盛顿谈判”称：据说，华盛顿三国谈判的主要目的，是解决与英国经济严重危机有关的各项问题。只有头脑简单的人，才相信这种说法。实际上，上述会议的召开，是为美国统治集团的这一愿望所促成，即贯彻旨在削弱与遏止美国经济危机之发展的措施。事实上，英国危机的加剧，不仅与美国经济危机的发展难以分解地连在一起，而且也正被美国统治集团千方百计地加以利用，来完成夺取英国经济的重要杠杆连同整个大英帝国的工作。
    华尔街计划的目的，首先是使英镑从属于美元，从而使美元变为独霸整个资本主义世界的垄断性的国际货币。其次，美国正在坚持地寻求减低或甚至取消英国与其他输进美货的国家中存在的关税。第三，美国正在为消灭所谓“英镑区”而斗争。最后，华尔街已把美国资本不仅对所谓落后地区而且也对英国及其他西欧国家进行大规模投资的问题，提到议事日程上。
    这样，鉴于美国经济危机的益日严重，美国统治集团的目的，一方面是制造战争心理和歇斯底里，促进军备竞赛和普遍猖狂的军国主义，并促进对苏联及人民民主国家进行“冷战”的冒险政策。另一方面，这一计划又规定美国资本对马歇尔化国家主要是英国进行更大规模的进攻，这势必引起工人阶级的生活水准进一步地急剧降低和资本家剥削的加紧。
    华尔街对英国实行进攻，它不仅使用口头恫吓，而且使用经济制裁办法。马歇尔计划对英拨款较请求的数额少六亿美元，确实就是属于这种办法的。此外，为了使伦敦屈膝，华盛顿正在把马歇尔化国家法、比、意组织为反英集团，由于法、比、意未直接参加三国谈判，根据报载，反英集团显然将在定于九月十三日开幕的国际货币基金会会议上露面。英美之间的这种斗争，已使整个马歇尔化国家阵营内部的矛盾严重化。华尔街使其西欧附庸国相互倾轧，这就使它分别加紧了对每一个附庸国的控制。臭名远扬的美国基础上的西欧“统一”，在实际上就是如此。
    谈到工党政府对美国要求（这些要求要使英国劳苦大众遭受无数困难）的态度时，马里宁指出，艾德礼、贝文与克利浦斯难于对美国的命令作重大抵抗。但是，公开的投降会在国内引起巨大纠纷，并会大大地破坏工党的选举计划，因为英国的劳苦大众对于英国统治集团奉行的卑躬屈膝和谄媚美元的政策，已日益不满。这就是为什么工党政府要耍花样，并与美国统治集团进行幕后讨价还价，来争取各种能够最后掩饰正在准备中的密约的单独的些微让步的原因。
    马里宁在结语时强调指出，不管这出戏的参加者使用什么不可靠的折衷办法和幕后阴谋，他们都将无法消除美英之间深刻而日益加剧的矛盾。
