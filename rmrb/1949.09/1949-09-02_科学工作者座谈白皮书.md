　　White Paper on Symposium of Scientific Workers
    Editor's Note: The Preparatory Committee of the All-China Natural Science Workers Representative Conference invited scientific workers in Peiping to a symposium on the afternoon of August 24 to discuss the White Paper on China published by US imperialism. In addition to the members of the Preparatory Committee of the China Scientific Workers Preparatory Committee, attendees at the symposium included scientific and technical workers from various production agencies and professors, lecturers, and teaching assistants from the colleges of science, engineering, agriculture, and medicine of various universities, as well as scientific workers who recently returned from the United States, totaling eighty-six people, each of whom spoke. Due to space limitations, some of the same opinions have been omitted. We hope that the participating gentlemen will forgive us!

    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    At the beginning of the symposium, Chairman Liu Ding briefly explained the significance of convening this symposium. He particularly pointed out: Although those of us who study natural sciences do not have as much understanding of national political issues as those who study social sciences, we must now understand national politics as members of the Chinese people. China's factories, mines, and farms are all closely related to us. We are national scientific research workers, and for the sake of national construction in the future, we need to discuss this issue. We want to express our attitude towards the "White Paper" to the masses of people at home and abroad.
    Then everyone proposed to divide into two groups for discussion, and elected Zeng Zhaolun and Yuan Hanqing to preside over them respectively.
    First Group Symposium
    Chairman (Zeng Zhaolun): The biggest international event recently is the publication of the US imperialist White Paper. We must specifically and carefully study this issue. Now, please express your opinions.
    Rao Yutai (Dean of the College of Science, Peking University): We must express stronger unity and shatter the conspiracies of US imperialism to provoke division.
    Yuan Fuli (Chairman of the Department of Geology, Tsinghua University): I completely agree with Mr. Rao's opinion.
    Xia Kangnong (Professor of Biology Department, Peking University): I agree with Mr. Rao.
    Jiang Yutu (Recently returned from the United States, now teaching at Peking Union Medical College): US imperialism妄想[tried in vain] to organize a fifth column in China and hopes that China will have so-called "democratic individualists" who serve American interests. Among us, some people used to want to be neutral and apolitical; today, it is clear that there is no third way. There are only two ways: one is the people's camp, and the other is the reactionary camp... We must separate the US imperialists from the American people. The chairman of the Maryland Communist Party of America talked to me and said: With you Chinese as an example, our work is much easier. Although the US government is reactionary now, the people still have those who understand; but there are also those who do not understand, and the US government wants to deceive these people.
    Zhang Runqing: There are probably no more scientific workers who want to follow US imperialism now, unless they go to Taiwan to find them. But there is a kind of thinking among us that easily arouses the illusions of US imperialism, that is, the view that natural science workers are apolitical. Therefore, we must change our apolitical and supra-class thinking.
    Chairman: The idea that science is supra-class is untenable. Now, please talk about what kind of work we should actively do?
    Yuan Fuli: The scientific community should strengthen unity and strive to do its job well.
    Hua Nanggui: We can issue a declaration to tell them: Don't dream!
    Sun Yunzhu (Chairman of the Department of Geology, Peking University): We must issue a declaration and use various languages to warn the international scientific community. US imperialism is deceiving us. It thinks we are still the same as before. Mr. Zhang just mentioned that we should eliminate the idea that science is supra-class. I think it is necessary to issue a declaration. We must issue a red paper in response to the US imperialist White Paper to warn our friends in the international scientific community.
    He Cheng: Imperialist countries always want to find agents in semi-colonial countries, and find their appropriate objects in different eras and different situations. In the past, imperialists found Chiang Kai-shek. When Chiang Kai-shek failed, they looked for Marshall's so-called "liberal elements" such as Zhang Qun. When Zhang Qun failed and the Kuomintang reactionary group collapsed, they looked for so-called "democratic individualists." The purpose is to find someone to replace Chiang Kai-shek and do things for them. However, many years of experience have educated the Chinese people and the Chinese intellectuals. If they do not take the road of the people, they will take the road of imperialism. The so-called third way is inevitably used as a fifth column. ...
    Chairman: No one in the liberated areas would want to be an American running dog, but we must be vigilant in our thinking. On the one hand, we must not be afraid of US imperialism, and on the other hand, we must not have a mentality of dependence on the United States. We will get help from the Soviet Union and other new democratic countries in Eastern Europe. We have overcome the most difficult problems in the past, and there are no difficulties that we cannot overcome now.
    Zhao Zhongli: The White Paper mentioned the Taiwan issue. We must clearly point out that this is Chinese territory and we have the right to take it back. US imperialism also said that the people's democratic dictatorship is a foreign system and demanded that the Chinese people oppose this system. But we must recognize that this is a system that is inevitably produced by historical development. The construction of new democratic countries is impossible without international assistance; but we can only ask the Soviet Union and the new democratic countries in Eastern Europe for it, and not US imperialism.
    Li Xianzhi (Chairman of the Department of Meteorology, Tsinghua University): The White Paper encourages Chinese "democratic individualism," which means that US imperialist aggression against China may shift from open to secret.
    Jiang Yutu: The newspaper said that Acheson stated that he would impose an economic blockade on us. We must persevere and work hard to be self-reliant. We must find ways to source industrial raw materials, books, tools, and machinery. We must organize organizations such as anti-US imperialist blockade industrial science research associations to solve all scientific problems for the industrial sector. This is one of our work tasks.
    Yan Jici: Scientific workers should not only help the industrial and commercial sectors, but we should also have anti-blockade measures for our own work. If we continue to rely on foreign countries as in the past, the future of scientific work will definitely be difficult and depressing. But if we can start from practical problems, difficulties can be easily solved. ... Everyone just paid attention to the term "democratic individualism." If you break this term apart, it is "democracy" and "individualism," which is also the so-called "liberalism." In order to do their own work, scientific workers often spend all their time studying advanced scientific theories and do not get involved in foreign affairs; therefore, they often have supra-class thinking. We must be especially vigilant about this. A few days ago, when studying "On People's Democratic Dictatorship," some people expressed doubts about China's leaning to one side. Now, looking at the White Paper, it can make us shudder and leave us with no hesitation.
    Gao Shiqi: US imperialists, in essence, look down on the Chinese people and do not treat us as equals. After using airplanes and cannons to support Chiang Kai-shek's failure, they attempted to conquer China with "democracy" and US dollars. This is what the White Paper declares. ...
    He Dongchang: Acheson's creation of the term "democratic individualism" has its reasons. When Marshall came to China, many people placed great hope in him; even when Wedemeyer came to China, many people still offered him many suggestions. Therefore, they felt that there was a group of people in China who could be used. In fact, many Chinese intellectuals have anti-imperialist ideas and will never willingly be American running dogs. But it is easy to dodge an open spear, but difficult to guard against a hidden arrow. For example, it can carry out slanderous propaganda, such as saying "there is no personal freedom under Communist rule," and so on. We must understand these issues clearly in order to prevent the cold arrows shot by US imperialism.
    Zhang Runqing: US imperialism is "reluctant to give up until the Yellow River is reached," and it will continue to invade in the future. But even if it launches an armed attack on us, we should not be afraid. It is a paper tiger. In terms of economy, Vice Chairman Zhou once said that although many American goods are imported into China, most of them are luxury goods. Therefore, it is not China that relies on the United States, but the United States that relies on China to dump goods.
    Hua Nanggui: I think we still need foreign help in terms of materials, but we must quickly open up roads in countries other than imperialist countries.
    Chairman: Self-reliance and international assistance do not conflict; but we cannot get help from imperialist countries, but from the Soviet Union and the new democratic countries in Eastern Europe.
    He Xuelun: "Democratic individualism" is not for workers and peasants, it is meaningless to talk to workers and peasants about it; it is specifically for intellectuals, especially intellectuals educated in Britain and the United States. US imperialism said that these people will rise up against the people's democratic dictatorship and deliberately slander the Soviet Union to provoke China's anti-Sovietism. Don't fall for it!
    Second Group Symposium
    Chairman (Yuan Hanqing): Since the newspaper published the White Paper, everyone has been talking about this issue. Today, we can gather dozens of people together, and we will definitely be able to exchange more opinions. Why was the White Paper published at this time? The focus is on providing how it helped Chiang Kai-shek and vaguely expressing its future policy toward China. It proposes "democratic individualism," so why is that? Now, let's first invite Mr. Zhang Daqi, who recently returned from the United States, to speak.
    Zhang Daqi: In the past, the United States has always been as aggressive as other imperialists in our country, but the methods are somewhat different. The so-called "helping China" is completely a mask. Since World War II, the United States has obtained the top position of aggression. The White Paper is an open admission that Chiang Kai-shek was used as a tool in the past. Now, it admits that the choice was wrong and declares that it will find other "democratic individualists," which is a new way of aggression to divide the unity of the Chinese people.
    Lu Zhiwei: This new conspiracy of the United States is its consistent proposition. The publication of the White Paper at this time is because it spent a lot of money for Chiang Kai-shek in the past, and it cannot account for it internally; if it is not published to China, it will be too late, because the coalition government is about to be established. At this time, the publication at least makes other countries dare not recognize it first. As for the call for "democratic individualism," it hopes that someone will continue to serve it and make trouble inside the new China and the new regime. On the one hand, we must be vigilant, and on the other hand, we must also know that some people have the idea of democratic individualism, but they are also very patriotic, and they are not necessarily sympathetic to the United States. It is wrong to think that they are American running dogs. We should unite these people to participate in our struggle against US imperialism.
    Yun Ziqiang: The United States' help to the Chinese reactionaries has completely failed. The bosses on Wall Street cannot account to the American people and cannot justify themselves, so they published this White Paper to show that they can still do something. But in our China, except for three enemies, all are our friends. In the liberated areas, we can all see that we can unite. The power of the people is great, and the United States has no way to deal with it; but it still wants to think of some ways, which is to put forward "democratic individualism" to call on these people to lean towards it. We advocate democracy and patriotism, but it is inevitable that some people's thinking is individualistic, and some people admire the material construction and some science and technology of the United States. But we should not discriminate against these people, because they are still patriotic, and they also hope to build the motherland quickly; we should help these people to politically recognize the essence of the imperialists...
    Miles (Foreign): The United States' publication of this White Paper is an open admission of the failure of its aggression against China; but it is still not reconciled to failure. The White Paper tells us that it will continue to invade China and recruit new anti-Soviet and anti-communist "democratic individualists." Every Chinese must recognize this point and declare to the world: US imperialism is a man-eating wolf. Personally, from a biological point of view, I believe that our scientific workers should strengthen their political studies and eliminate the illusion that science is apolitical.
    Meng Shaonong: This so-called "democratic individualism" proposed by Acheson this time, we should recognize that this is its conspiracy to continue to invade our country. We must resolutely work hard under the leadership of the People's Government. The United States' policy toward China has always been aimed at aggression, but the methods are somewhat different. Now it knows that supporting Chiang Kai-shek has failed, but it still does not give up its policy of interference and wants to find "democratic individualists" to be its puppets.
    Tu Shou'e (Professor of Tsinghua University): As long as we recognize this conspiracy, we will not be used by US imperialism.
    Zhang Daqi: The United States has used various methods to invade China since not today. In the past, it used Hu Shih as an example. At present, there are many such liberals in various universities in China. We should actively unite them and help them recognize this conspiracy.
    Huang Ziqing (Professor of Chemistry Department, Tsinghua University, newly returned from the United States): There are more than twenty Chinese students in C.C.T., and without exception, they support the victory of the new people. They are particularly excited every time they hear the broadcast of the People's Government abroad. It is natural to mention individualism, but they are indeed patriotic, and they are very willing to come back to participate in the construction of the motherland. We should broadcast and publicize more to them so that they can have a deeper understanding of the various policies of the People's Government.
    Gao Chongxi: After the publication of the White Paper, I asked an American friend why it was published at this time. He replied to me: In the past, the people of the United States and China did not know how much material the United States had assisted Chiang Kai-shek. After this disclosure, they can know the exact number. As for the call for "democratic individualism," it is just to find running dogs who are anti-Soviet and anti-communist.
    Le Tianyu: The United States' proposal of this doctrine is not accidental, nor is it unfounded, but because some people in our country still miss the old democracy. The United States emphasizes the launch of democratic individualism, which shows that it has seen this part of the people in China. The publication of the White Paper shows that the paper tiger has been exposed, which shows that they are helpless militarily and have to try to win over "democratic individualists" to work as the fifth column...
    Wang Yunzhang: The White Paper has more domestic components, indicating that aid to Chiang Kai-shek has been very strong, and the failure was caused by Chiang Kai-shek. We must be vigilant about the so-called "democratic individualism" issue.
    Zhu Weiheng: When I was in the United States, all Chinese students had to fill out a form and sign to indicate that when the United States fought against foreign countries, they should stand on the side of the United States. Some people refused, and some people signed; but no one thought that the United States would fight against China. Therefore, I advocate that the Scientific Workers' Representative Conference should maintain more contact with students who have not returned from the United States and focus on external propaganda.
    Chairman: Regarding this point, this association is actively trying to proceed.
    Yang Jie: We must unite scientific workers, and we should not fail to unite them because others have individualistic ideas. Such ideas may exist among us, because they have certain social roots; but as far as I know, most of the students studying science in the United States love our new country and support the new democracy. On the other hand, for ourselves, we must be vigilant at all times to avoid being used by imperialism.
    Zhang Zhaoqian: Americans believe that socialism is dictatorial. They believe that those who oppose the Soviet Union are all democratic individualists. Most of the intellectuals in China have individualistic ideas. But we should say that we want to support socialism.
    Tu Shou'e: In the eyes of American capitalists, democracy and democratic individualism are a matter of course. In the past, many people in China yearned for the United States and approved of the old democracy. Only after liberation did they realize what true democracy is. We can criticize individualism, but we cannot therefore despise these people, but should warmly unite these people and work together with them.
    Meng Shaonong: After the Anti-Japanese War, the United States dumped some things, all of which were domestic surplus goods. China is by no means indispensable to the United States. Some time ago, Stuart left Nanjing to wait and see. Later, we clearly expressed that we did not rely on US imperialism, so he blockaded us; but we are not afraid, we are prepared and do not have illusions.
    Yang Jie: In the past, I thought, "Wouldn't it be great if the United States could help us in developing industry!" Now I know that this is an illusion that should not be had.
    Overall Symposium
    Chairman (Liu Ding): Just now, the discussions in both groups were very enthusiastic. Many people have not finished speaking. Today is just a beginning. First, let us concentrate on reporting the main contents of the two groups' symposiums.
    Zeng Zhaolun: The discussions in our group just now were generally: First, regarding the White Paper issue: The United States' relations with China have been consistently aggressive, but there are new contents in it. The most important thing is to sow discord within China, win over the so-called "democratic individualists," and provoke the relationship between China and the Soviet Union internationally. Second, the United States has always looked down on China, and the White Paper on China is an open insult to the Chinese people and our country. The most vicious thing is Wedemeyer's report, which wants to turn the Northeast into a UN co-managed area; in addition, the future direction of US imperialist aggression, which used to be to use reactionary groups to invade, today attempts to find so-called "democratic individualists" to carry out aggression, while implementing an economic blockade against China.
    Speaking of "democratic individualists," we know that it is targeting the general petty bourgeoisie, national bourgeoisie, and intellectuals in China, especially many people among us who have received British and American-style education. Therefore, we cannot ignore the issue of "democratic individualism." Of course, we know that at present, it is impossible to find a true follower of US imperialism's fifth column among the vast number of intellectuals; but even so, we must be vigilant and not fall for the enemy's tricks. One of the easiest problems to occur is the mistaken idea of relying on the help of US imperialism. We must be clear about this. We should realize that it is absolutely impossible for US imperialism to help the Chinese people.
    As for what work scientific workers should do? First of all, we must do our job well. We must strengthen unity. Regarding the White Paper issue, we advocate that the Chinese scientific community should have a solemn declaration, which should be written not only in Chinese, but also in various languages and published internationally to tell US imperialism that its illusions in China are absolutely impossible to realize. We in the scientific community must do this ourselves, and on the one hand, we must also promote it to the industrial sector so that they know that the difficulties in science and technology can be solved by ourselves in China without relying on the United States. In our thinking and actions, we must actively oppose the blockade of US imperialism. At the same time, we must strengthen unity with workers and peasants domestically and strengthen unity with the Soviet Union internationally. We all agree that US imperialism has no future. It sows discord everywhere, while its own country has unprecedented lack of freedom and democracy. For example, when Wallace gave a speech in a certain city in the United States, he could not find a hotel to accommodate him. At the same time, the progressive forces in the United States have gained the support of the vast majority of the American people. All of these make us believe that the conspiracy of US imperialism will be defeated, and the United States is ultimately just a "paper tiger."
    Yuan Hanqing: The situation of our second group's symposium is very similar to that of the first group. Regarding why the American "White Paper" was published at this time? Most people believe that this is a new conspiracy; at the same time, some people say that this is to account for the US internally. In short, the United States' basic policy toward China is aggression; we must be prepared. Regarding the issue of how to overcome the "democratic individualism" thinking among scientific workers? Most people believe that we should review and be vigilant with each other.
    Chairman: In order for everyone to have a deeper understanding of the essential nature of US imperialism's aggression and its conspiracy, we should launch a broader discussion in the scientific community. We know that this conspiracy of his is bound to fail; but we cannot just sit and wait for him to fail. There must be a struggle here. We need to strengthen our unity, get closer to the four friends in the country, especially get closer to the workers and peasants; unite with truly peace-loving countries internationally, and be self-reliant. In this way, we will surely defeat the conspiracy and provocation of US imperialism... At present, we must carefully understand and study the new democracy and transform ourselves. Participating in the discussion of such a practical political issue is a good ideological help for scientific workers; at the same time, the atmosphere of such a gathering is first of all a solid answer to US imperialism...

### 科学工作者座谈白皮书

专栏：

　　科学工作者座谈白皮书
    编者按：中华全国自然科学工作者代表大会筹备会，于八月二十四日下午，邀请在平的科学工作者举行座谈会，讨论美帝国主义所发表的对华白皮书。出席座谈的除中国科学工作者筹备会的筹委外，包括各生产机关的科学技术工作者和各大学理、工、农、医学院的教授、讲师、助教，以及新近由美国回国的科学工作者，共八十六人，每人都发言了。因限于篇幅，有些相同的意见略去，希参加座谈的诸先生原谅！
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    座谈会开始由主席刘鼎简单说明召开这次座谈会的意义，他特别指出：我们研究自然科学的人虽然不如研究社会科学的人对国家政治问题认识的那样多；但现在我们做为中国人民的一分子，就要了解国家政治。中国的工厂、矿山、农场都与我们有密切关系，我们是国家科学研究工作者，今后为了国家的建设，需要我们来讨论这个问题。我们要向国内外的人民大众表示我们对“白皮书”的态度。
    接着大家提议，要求分两组进行讨论，推出曾昭抡、袁翰青分别主持。
    第一组座谈
    主席（曾昭抡）：最近国际上最大的事情就是美帝白皮书的发表。我们必须具体地仔细地来研究这个问题，现在请大家发表意见。
    饶毓泰（北大理学院长）：我们要表示更坚强的团结，打破美帝的挑拨阴谋。
    袁复礼（清华地质系主任）：我完全同意饶先生的意见。
    夏康农（北大生物系教授）：我同意饶先生的话。
    蒋豫图（刚从美国回来，现在协和医学院任教）：美帝妄想在中国组织第五纵队，并希望中国有服役于美国利益的所谓“民主个人主义者”。我们当中，过去还有人想中立，超政治；今天已明白没有第三条路，只有两条路：一是人民的阵营，一是反动的阵营了……我们要把美帝和美国人民分开。曼丽兰的美共主席和我谈起了他说：有你们中国做榜样，我们的工作容易做多了。现在美政府虽然反动，人民总还有明白的；但其中也有不明白的，美政府就是要欺骗这些人。
    张润庆：现在的科学工作者还想跟美帝走的大概没有了，除非到台湾去找。但是我们当中有一种思想容易引起美帝的幻想，就是自然科学工作者超政治的看法。因此我们要改变超政治、超阶级的思想。
    主席：科学超阶级，这种思想是行不通的。现在请大家谈一谈，我们要积极地做那些工作？
    袁复礼：科学界要加紧团结，努力把工作做好。
    华南圭：我们可以发表一个宣言告诉他们：你们不要做梦！
    孙云铸（北大地质系主任）：我们要发表宣言，并且要用各国文字正告国际科学界。美帝欺骗我们，它以为我们还和以前一样。刚才张先生提到要清除科学超阶级的思想。我想发一个宣言是必要的。我们必须针对美帝白皮书来发一个红皮书正告国际科学界的朋友。
    贺诚：帝国主义国家对于半殖民地国家总要想找代理人，在各个不同时代，各个不同情况下找它的适当对象，过去帝国主义者找到蒋介石。蒋介石不行了，就找马歇尔所谓的“自由主义分子”张群之流。张群不行了，国民党反动集团垮台了，于是就再找所谓“民主个人主义者”。目的就在找人代蒋介石替它做事。可是许多年来的经验教育了中国人民，也教育了中国知识分子，如果不走人民的道路便会走帝国主义的道路。所谓第三条路就难免被利用作第五纵队。………
    主席：在解放区决不会有人愿当美国走狗，但我们在思想上要警惕。一方面不要怕美帝国主义，一方面不要存依赖美国心理。我们会得到苏联和东欧各新民主主义国家的帮助。我们过去最困难的问题都克服了，现决没有不能克服的困难。
    赵中立：白皮书曾提到台湾问题。我们必须明白指出这是中国领土，我们有权收回。还有美帝说人民民主专政是外来制度，并要求中国人反对这种制度。但我们必须认清，这是历史发展必然产生的一种制度。新民主主义国家的建设没有国际援助是不可能的；但我们只能向苏联和东欧新民主主义国家去要，不能向美帝国主义去要。
    李宪之（清华气象系主任）：白皮书中鼓励中国“民主个人主义”，就是表示美帝对华侵略可能由公开转向秘密。
    蒋豫图：报上说艾奇逊申明要在经济上封锁我们，我们更要坚持努力，自力更生。对于工业原料、书籍、工具、机器的来源我们要想办法。我们要组织反美帝封锁产业科学研究会一类的组织；替产业界解决一切科学上的问题，这是我们工作任务之一。
    严济慈：科学工作者不但要帮忙工商界，我们对自己的工作方面也要有反封锁的办法。如果照过去那种依赖外国的情形，科学工作前途困难和苦闷一定很多。但是如果我们能从实际问题出发，困难就容易解决。……刚才大家都注意“民主个人主义”这个名辞。把这个名辞拆开便是“民主主义”和“个人主义”也就是所谓“自由主义”。科学工作者为了自己业务往往全副时间全花在钻研高深科学理论，不与闻外事；因此也往往有超阶级思想。这可要格外警惕。前几天在学习“论人民民主专政”时，就有人对中国一面倒表示疑义，现在看看白皮书，就可使我们毛骨耸然，而无可犹豫了。
    高士其：美帝国主义者，在本质上是看不起中国人的，是不以平等地位看待我们的。他在用飞机大炮支援蒋贼失败之后，又企图用“民主”和美钞来征服中国。这便是白皮书所宣告的事情。……
    何东昌：艾奇逊造出“民主个人主义”这个名辞还是有他的道理的。马歇尔到中国来了，曾有不少人对他寄予很大希望；即在魏德迈到中国来时，仍有不少人向他提供很多意见。因此他们才觉得在中国有一批人可以利用一下。实际上中国的许多知识分子有反帝国主义思想的，决不会甘心去充美帝走狗。但是明枪易躲，暗箭难防。譬如，它可以进行诬蔑的宣传，如说“在共产党统治下没有个人自由”等等。我们必须把这些问题搞得清清楚楚，才能防止美帝射来的冷箭。
    张润庆：美帝国主义是“到了黄河心还不死的”，它今后仍然会继续侵略。但即使它武装进攻我们也不要怕，它是一只纸老虎。在经济方面，周副主席曾经说过，输入中国的美国货虽不少，但绝大部分是奢侈品。因此，不是中国依靠美国，而是美国依靠中国倾销商品。
    华南圭：我认为在物质方面我们还需要外国帮助，但必须赶快在帝国主义以外的国家开辟道路。
    主席：自力更生和国际帮助并不冲突；但是不能从帝国主义方面得到帮助，而要从苏联及东欧新民主主义国家方面得到帮助。
    何学纶：“民主个人主义”不是对工农讲，对工农讲没有意义；而是专对知识分子讲的，尤其是受英美教育的知识分子。美帝说这些人会起来反对人民民主专政，并故意污蔑苏联以挑拨中国反苏。这可不要上它的当！
    第二组座谈
    主席（袁翰青）：自从报纸发表白皮书以来，大家都在谈此问题，今天能聚集数十位在一起，一定能交换更多的意见。白皮书为什么在此时发表呢？着重点是在供出如何帮助过蒋介石并隐约的表示将来对华政策，它提出“民主个人主义”，这又是为什么呢？现在先请新由美回国不久的张大奇先生讲话。
    张大奇：美国在过去一向是和其他帝国主义者一样的侵略我国，只是方式上有些不同，所谓“帮助中国”完全是假面具，自第二次世界大战后，美国取得了侵略的头等地位。白皮书是公开承认了过去拿蒋介石当工具，现在承认选择错误，宣称另找“民主个人主义”者，是想分化中国人民团结的一种新侵略方式。
    陆志韦：美国这次新阴谋，是他的一贯的主张。此时发表白皮书，对内是因为过去为蒋介石花去许多钱，无法交帐；对中国则如再不发表，就赶不上了，因为联合政府即将成立，此时发表至少让别的国家也不敢先承认。至于“民主个人主义”的号召，是希望有人继续替它服务，在新中国新政权的内部捣乱。我们一方面要警惕，一方面也要知道有些人虽有民主个人主义的思想，但也是很爱国的，更不一定是同情美国者，若一概认为是美国走狗，则是错误的。我们应团结这些人来参加我们反对美帝国主义的斗争。
    恽子强：美国帮助中国反动派现在已经完全失败，华尔街的老板对于美国人民报不了帐，无法自圆其说，才发表这个白皮书，说明他还可以做些事情。但在我们中国国内除三个敌人外，都是我们友人，凡解放地区我们都看出是能团结的，人民力量是伟大的，使美国没有办法；而他仍想些办法，就是提出“民主个人主义”，来号召这些人们倾向他。我们是主张民主的，是爱国的，但难免有部分人的思想是个人主义的，也有些人崇拜美国的物质建设，和一些科学技术。可是我们对这些人不能歧视，因为他们仍是爱国的，他们也希望把祖国赶快建设好；我们应帮助这些人从政治上认清楚帝国主义者的本质……。
    米乐斯（外籍）：美国这次发表白皮书，是公开承认侵略中国的失败；但它仍不自甘失败。白皮书里告诉我们他要继续侵略中国，要招募新的反苏、反共的“民主个人主义”者。每一个中国人都要认清这一点，要向全世界宣告：美帝国主义是吃人的狼。个人站在生物学方面，认为我们科学工作者应加强政治方面的学习，肃清科学超政治的幻想。
    孟少农：这次艾奇逊提出的所谓“民主个人主义”，我们应该认清这是它妄想继续侵略我国的阴谋。我们则要在人民政府领导下坚决努力工作。美国的对华政策一贯是以侵略为目的的，只是有时在方式上有些不同。现在他知道支持蒋贼失败了，但是他仍不放弃他的干涉政策，要寻找“民主个人主义”者作其傀儡。
    屠守锷（清华大学教授）：只要我们认清这个阴谋，就不会被美帝利用了。
    张大奇：美国利用各种方式侵略中国不自今日起，过去他利用胡适等就是一例。在目前中国各大学里这种自由主义分子很多，我们应该积极团结他们，帮助他们认清这一阴谋。
    黄子卿（清华大学化学系教授，新自美国回国）：在美国的留学生在Ｃ·Ｃ·Ｔ·的共有二十几位，没有例外都拥护新的人民的胜利，在国外每次听到人民政府的广播特别兴奋。提到个人主义自然是难免的，但他们确是爱国的，而且他们很愿意回来参加祖国的建设工作。我们应多向他们广播宣传，使他们更深地了解人民政府的各种政策。
    高崇熙：白皮书发表后，我曾问过一个美国朋友为什么在此时发表。他回答我：过去美国和中国两国的人民对于美国援助蒋介石的物资都不知多少，经过这次披露，可以知道确数了。至“民主个人主义”的号召，不过想寻找反苏反共的走狗而已。
    乐天宇：美国提出这种主义不是偶然的，也并非凭空的，而是由于我国有的人对旧民主主义也还留恋，美帝强调发动民主个人主义，便是看清了中国有这一部分人。白皮书的发表，纸老虎是戳穿了，这说明了他们在军事上既无可奈何，不得已妄想争取“民主个人主义者”作第五纵队工作………。
    王云章：白皮书是对内的成份多，表示援蒋已很卖力气，失败是被蒋介石搞坏了的。所谓“民主个人主义”问题，我们要好好地警惕。
    朱维衡：我在美国时，凡中国学生都要填表签字，表示当美国对外国作战时，应站在美国这方面。有人拒绝，也有人签了字；但是没有人想到美国会对中国作战的。因此我主张科学工作者代表会应多和留美未回国的学生保持联络，着重对外宣传。
    主席：关于此点，本会刻正积极设法进行。
    杨捷：我们要团结科学工作者，不要因别人有个人主义的思想便不团结他们。我们之间这种思想是可能有的，因为有它一定的社会根源；可是据我所了解，在美国学科学的学生大部是爱护我们新国家的，对新民主主义是拥护的。另一方面，对自己来说，则要随时警惕，免为帝国主义利用。
    张肇骞：美国人认为社会主义是独裁的，他们以为反对苏联的人都是民主个人主义者，我们中国的知识分子多半带有个人主义思想的。但我们应该说，我们要拥护社会主义。
    屠守锷：在美国资本主义者看来，民主和民主个人主义是天经地义的。以前中国有许多人向往美国，赞成旧民主，至解放后才认识到什么是真民主。我们可以批判个人主义，但不能因此便轻视这些人，而应该热忱地团结这些人，与其共同工作。
    孟少农：抗战后美国倾销了些东西，都是些国内过剩的物品。中国决不是非依赖美国不可。前些时司徒雷登留在南京观望，后来我们明白表示了不依赖美帝，他就封锁我们；但我们是不怕的，我们有准备，不存幻想。
    杨捷：过去以为“在发展工业上美国能帮助我们岂不很好！”现在知道这是不应有的幻想。
    全体座谈
    主席（刘鼎）：刚才两组讨论的都非常热烈，许多人的意见都还没有说完，今天只是一个开始，我们首先把两组座谈的主要内容集中报告一下。
    曾昭抡：刚才我们这一组的讨论，大体上是：第一，关于白皮书问题：美国对华关系是一贯的侵略，但这里面有新的内容，最主要的是挑拨离间中国内部拉拢所谓“民主个人主义”者，并挑拨国际上中苏的关系。第二，美国一向是看不起中国的，对华的白皮书则是公开地侮辱了我们中国人民和我们国家，最阴毒的是其中魏德迈的报告，要把东北变成联合国共管；另外美帝将来侵略的方向，过去曾经是利用反动集团方式来侵略，今天则企图找到所谓“民主个人主义”者来进行侵略，同时对中国经济实行封锁。
    谈到“民主个人主义”者，我们知道他瞄准的正是中国的一般小资产阶级、民族资产阶级和知识分子，尤其是象我们中间许多受过英美式教育的人。因此，我们就不能把“民主个人主义”这问题置之不理。当然我们知道目前在广大的知识分子中，不会找到一个真心愿做美帝第五纵队的跟踪者；但即使这样，我们还要警惕，不要上敌人的当。有一个最容易发生的问题，就是依赖美帝国主义帮助的错误思想，这点我们一定要弄清楚，我们应当认识到美帝是决不可能帮助中国人民的。
    至于科学工作者应该做那些工作？我们首先要把自己岗位工作作好，我们一定要加强团结工作。对于白皮书问题，我们主张中国的科学界应有一郑重的宣言，不但用中文，而且要用各国文字写出来，到国际上去发表，告诉美帝国主义在中国的幻想是绝不可能实现的。我们科学界本身要这样做，一方面还要推广到产业界，使他们知道科学技术方面的困难，我们中国自己会想法解决的，不需要依赖美国。我们在思想上、行动上，都要积极反美帝的封锁。同时，在国内更要加强与工农的团结；在国际上要加强与苏联的团结。我们一致认为美帝是没有前途的，他到处挑拨离间，而自己国内是空前的没有自由、没有民主，例如华莱士在美国某城演讲，就找不到一个旅馆来招待他住。同时目前美国进步的势力是已经得到了广大的美国人民的拥护，这些都使我们相信美帝的阴谋必败，美国最终也不过是一只“纸老虎”而已。
    袁翰青：我们第二组座谈情形，有很大部分和第一组相同。关于美国“白皮书”为何在这时发表？大部分人认为这是一种新阴谋；同时也有人说这是对付美国内部的交帐。总而言之，美国对华的基本政策是侵略；我们要有一个准备。关于在科学工作者中，如何克服“民主个人主义”思想的问题？大部分人认为要互相检讨和互相警惕。
    主席：为了大家能更深刻地认识美帝国主义的侵略主义本质及其阴谋，应在科学界展开更广泛的讨论。我们知道他这种阴谋，是必然会失败的；但我们不能光坐着等他失败，这里必须要有斗争。我们需要加强自己的团结，好好靠近国内四个朋友，特别要靠近工农；联合国际上真正爱好和平的国家，自力更生。这样我们就一定会战胜美帝的阴谋挑拨……。目前我们要好好体会、研究新民主主义，改造自己。参加象这样一个实际政治问题的讨论，对科学工作者是一个思想上的很好的帮助；同时象这样聚会的空气，首先就是给美帝一个坚实的回答……。
