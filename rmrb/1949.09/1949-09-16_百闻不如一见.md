　　Seeing Once is Better Than Hearing a Hundred Times
    Bai He
    When enthusiastic audiences walked out of the crowded cinema after watching "A Million Soldiers Cross the Yangtze," a young audience member said to another: "This film is really good. We saw the army crossing the river. Seeing it is indeed better than hearing about it a hundred times!"
    Speaking of the million-strong army crossing the Yangtze River, most people generally feel it's a mysterious story, thinking that the river is so wide and the enemy is guarding the south bank, how could they possibly cross it? Even though the People's Liberation Army had already liberated Shanghai, Nanjing, Hangzhou, and advanced into Fujian, most people couldn't see the actual scene of the crossing. There was always a sense of vagueness in their minds. Now, seeing this true documentary film has etched an indelible impression in people's minds.
    From this impression, the audience recognizes that the People's Liberation Army is a people's army with class and political education, armed with Mao Zedong Thought. The natural barrier of the Yangtze River cannot stop it. Moreover, it can be seen from this that this fighting force, representing the interests of the people of the whole country, will soon liberate the whole country. On the other hand, the reactionary Kuomintang army, although equipped with American imperialist arms, had officers and soldiers who were unwilling to be cannon fodder and could only lay down their weapons and flee, becoming prisoners of war. This further seals its fate of extinction.
    From this impression, the audience can see that the people and the People's Liberation Army are integrated. They transport ammunition, deliver grain, carry stretchers, and brave sailors steer boats across the river, forming a steel army, surging across the Yangtze together. The people of the south of the Yangtze beat gongs and drums to welcome the People's Liberation Army; while when the bandit army fled, the people avoided them completely, with ammunition, weapons, firewood, rice, and grain abandoned all over the ground, some even discarding their marching pots.
    From this impression, the audience sees that after the People's Liberation Army enters the big cities, they sleep on the side of the road, truly achieving not disturbing the people's one needle or one thread. People from all walks of life are so moved that they come out enthusiastically to comfort them, as if comforting their long-lost children who have returned home.
    From this impression, the broad masses of the audience have strengthened their confidence in the rapid victory of the revolution, and the hearts of the people are drawing closer to the revolution step by step. And even the very few people who still harbor illusions about American imperialism and the Kuomintang remnants should be more sober after seeing this film.
    People who have long been deceived by the propaganda of the feudal ruling class are not easily convinced of things they have not seen with their own eyes; at the same time, in feudal society, the vast majority of people's children do not have the opportunity to study, do not have the ability to read newspapers, and even less have the habit of caring about world and national affairs. Therefore, the production of war newsreels has important significance today. Moreover, this "Million Soldiers Cross the Yangtze" has a relatively systematic structure from the beginning to the end of its story, with considerable ideological strength, so its educational effect is easily achieved.

　　百闻不如一见
    白河
    当热烈的观众，看罢“百万雄师下江南”，从拥挤的电影院走出来的时候，一个年青的观众对另一个观众说：“这片子真好，咱们看到了大军过江，真是百闻不如一见！”
    说到百万大军过长江，一般人总觉得是一个神秘的故事，以为江那么宽，敌人又把守在南岸，怎么能过得去哟？纵然，人民解放军早解放了上海、南京、杭州，又进到了福建，但这个渡江的故事，一般人看不到那种情景，在思想里总是有点茫茫然。现在，看到了这个真实的记录影片，在人们思想里永远刻上了一个不能磨灭的印象。
    从这印象里，使观众认识到人民解放军是有阶级、政治教育、有毛泽东思想武装的人民子弟兵，长江天险是挡不住它的；而且，由这里可以看出这只代表着全国人民利益的战斗部队不久会解放全国的。从另一方面看，国民党反动军队，虽然有美帝的武装配备，但不愿当炮灰的官兵，只有放下武器逃跑，当俘虏，这就更注定了它的灭亡命运。
    从这印象里，可以使观众看到人民和解放军打成一片，运子弹、送粮草、抬担架、勇敢的水手撑船渡江，形成一只钢铁的大队，一齐涌过长江，江南的人民都敲锣打鼓地欢迎解放军；而匪军败逃的时候，人民躲避一空，满地丢弃着弹药武器，柴米粮草，有的把行军锅也不要了。
    从这印象里，使观众看到人民解放军进入大城市以后，他们都睡在马路旁边，真是做到了不扰乱老百姓的一针一线，感动的各阶级人民都热烈地出来慰劳，仿佛慰劳自己长长甜家归求的儿女。
    从这印象，广大的观众增强了对革命迅速将要胜利的信心，人民的心一步步更向革命靠拢了。而有些极少数的对美帝、国民党残存着幻想的人们，看过这片子之后也该更清醒了。
    长期被封建统治阶级欺骗宣传的人们，对于他们自己没亲眼见到的事情总不大容易相信；同时，在封建社会里，广大的人民子弟没有读书的机会，没有看报的能力，更没有关心世界、国家大事的习惯；因此，战争新闻片的拍制，在今天是有它重要的意义。何况，这个“百万雄师下江南”，从它故事的开始，经过，到结尾是有着比较系统的结构、与它相当强的思想性，因而，它的教育效果也就容易收到。
