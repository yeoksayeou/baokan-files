　　Municipal People's Government
  　Establishes Middle School Scholarship
  　Education Bureau Formulates Provisional Measures to be Implemented Next Month
    [This Municipality News] The Municipal People's Government has recently established a People's Scholarship to assist students from public and private secondary schools who are from impoverished families or whose economic ties with their families have been severed due to the war, so they can continue their studies. The Municipal Education Bureau recently issued a "Notice on the Promulgation of Provisional Measures for People's Scholarships in Middle Schools of Beiping Municipality" to all schools, along with a copy of the "Provisional Measures for People's Scholarships in Middle Schools of Beiping Municipality." The measures stipulate that students who meet one of the following conditions, study diligently, have excellent grades, and are willing to serve the people, may apply for the People's Scholarship: (1) Those from impoverished families who are unable to support themselves, verified by the local village, district, or county government, or police station, or local directly affiliated trade union with written proof and detailed materials on their family's economic situation; (2) Those who are proven by more than two-thirds of their classmates to have no source of income and no help from relatives or friends. Students applying for the scholarship should fill out an application form and submit it along with supporting documents to the school affairs committee. The school affairs committee should first submit it to the student union for preliminary opinions through democratic discussion, and then the school affairs committee or the People's Scholarship Review Committee (composed of the principal or director of studies, director of general affairs, representatives of teachers and staff, student representatives, and other necessary personnel) should conduct a thorough review, provide opinions, and submit it to the People's Government Education Bureau for approval. The school will then uniformly collect the funds. The amount of the People's Scholarship is divided into three types, A, B, and C, depending on the applicant's different economic situations. Type A is 70 kilograms of millet per person per month, Type B is 50 kilograms, and Type C is 35 kilograms. The quota for People's Scholarships in each school will be reviewed once per semester, and should not be increased except in special circumstances. However, the school should regularly understand the students' economic situation, and the scholarship should be terminated when family economic assistance is obtained. If false reports are found or the spirit of the provisional measures is not met, the scholarship may be revoked, or the student may be ordered to return all or part of the amount received, depending on the circumstances. Students who drop out of school, transfer to another school, or change careers will also have their scholarships revoked. School authorities who make false reports or engage in other fraudulent activities in the application and processing of People's Scholarships will be subject to punishment. As for the normal schools under the jurisdiction of the Education Bureau, all students will be provided with food expenses, budgeted at 70 kilograms of millet per person per month based on the actual number of students in the school. The children of impoverished revolutionary martyrs and cadres, whose parents are on the supply system, are entitled to public funding; the specific measures will be formulated separately. The provisional measures for the People's Scholarship will be implemented from October 1, 1949. After implementation, the temporary relief fund measures for impoverished students previously promulgated by the People's Government Education Bureau will be abolished. The Education Bureau stipulated in the notice that each school should immediately announce the measures to the students after receiving them and begin the application process. However, freshmen in the first year of senior and junior high school (excluding students who are promoted from the third year of junior high school to the first year of senior high school within the same school) will not apply in September. In September, each school will temporarily implement the Education Bureau's temporary relief fund measures. Once the quota for scholarships in public schools throughout the city is determined and the provisional measures are officially announced, each school will conduct a review based on the regulations after receiving detailed instructions from the Education Bureau.
