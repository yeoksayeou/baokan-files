　　Visiting the Yantongshan Iron Mine
　　By Our Reporter on the Ping-Sui Railway Line, Li Yi
　　The Yantongshan Iron Mine is located five kilometers north of Xuanhua City, situated in a narrow valley that is only a few thousand meters long from north to south. The mining area is divided into four sections: "Western," "Eastern," "Southern Neighbor," and "Southern Mountain." The total iron ore reserves are over 16.6 million tons, with an iron content of approximately 45%. During the late period of the Japanese occupation, because the Pangjiabao Mine was established (where the iron ore has an iron content of 62%, far superior to Yantongshan), this mine was abandoned. Most of the mechanical equipment was lost. After Xuanhua was liberated again last December, the North China People's Government, considering the urgent need for iron ore at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant in Beiping and the relatively convenient transportation from Yantongshan, decided to first continue small-scale mining. Since officially starting work in April, thanks to the efforts of all employees, most of the mine's old pits have been restored, and the mechanical equipment is being prepared. The number of employees has increased from 144 when it was liberated to over 1,600. The total mining volume from April to August reached 28,500 tons.
　　The mountain is still Yantongshan, and the mine pits are still the ones abandoned by the Japanese, but in the eight months since liberation, through the arduous efforts of all employees to restore construction, Yantongshan has indeed changed its appearance. During the Kuomintang bandit gang's rule, 144 employees were used, exclusively selecting old iron sand left behind by the Japanese, with a daily artificial mining output of only 15 tons of new ore. After the People's Government took over last December, it immediately began collecting and preparing the damaged machinery, actively restoring mechanical mining. Electrical workers first erected over 9,000 meters of dedicated high-voltage power transmission lines from Xuanhua to Yantongshan, as well as lighting for all tunnels, ore transport roads, and the ore dressing plant. Mechanical craftsmen found accessories such as toothed wheels, bearing bushes, and tie rods from scrap metal piles, and repaired two abandoned air compressors of 30 and 100 horsepower in the warehouse. Currently, 30, 50, and 153 hoists, and two 300-horsepower air compressors are being repaired. Since April, track workers have successively extended and repaired approximately 3,000 meters of 15-kilogram light rail for transporting ore. Foundry craftsmen in the machine factory have cast nearly a thousand ore car wheels for the mine and prepared 220 new ore cars. This has shifted the ore mining from purely manual labor to gradually becoming semi-mechanized. Under the active education of the trade union and the administration, the gap between new and old workers has gradually been eliminated. Over 1,400 new workers, under the guidance of veteran workers, have quickly learned the technology, resulting in a universal increase in the production efficiency of the entire mine. According to statistics, the number of work hours required to mine one ton of raw ore has decreased from an average of 2.7 in May to an average of 1.5 in August. The amount of explosives used per ton of raw ore has decreased from a maximum of 1,400 centimeters in June to a maximum of 374 centimeters in August.
　　Over the past eight months, all operations in the large and small tunnels of Yantongshan have consistently implemented a long-term, prudent, and careful policy. In order to quickly obtain iron sand, the Japanese imperialists did not consider tunneling in all the tunnels, and as soon as they entered the tunnels, they carried out mining on the surface without any supports. At the same time, because the main tunnel operations did not follow regulations, the tunnel sizes were inconsistent, and there were no appropriate bends or slopes, the tunnels often lost the possibility of advancing mining due to collapses at the entrance or in unsupported areas. In order to thoroughly correct this bad operation by the Japanese bandits, a difficult reorganization work was carried out throughout the mountain in August, and it was strictly stipulated that the width of future roadway operations should not exceed 2.5 meters, vigorously tunneling the main roadway while conducting extremely regular mining on the surface. A skilled technician told me: "Currently, a large amount of iron sand that was abandoned during the Japanese rule due to the lack of fixed operating rules is being picked up between the two tunnels." He said, "This is to be responsible to the people, not to let the treasures be abandoned forever."
　　In terms of safety equipment, the Yantongshan Mine has made many improvements. In addition to conducting regular safety education, the leading comrades of the mine have also made the following practical facilities: 1. Widen the excessively low tunnels to avoid the danger of bumping heads when transporting ore from the inside of the tunnels to the outside; 2. Universally support the roof slabs that have collapsed and the mineral pillars that have been mined with wooden pillars or masonry with stones; 3. Carry out blasting from the inside to the outside to avoid danger; 4. Implement "searching and removing" (that is, manually chisel off the ore that has not been blasted off after blasting, so as to prevent it from being unprepared when it naturally collapses; 5. Change the heavy-duty ore transport road near the cliff to the inner road; 6. Universally install safety iron blocks above the sand storage chute to avoid the danger of people and vehicles being destroyed in the event of a rollover; 7. Install rails at the end of each ore transport track to prevent runaway ore cars due to manipulation failure. All of this has gradually made the mining and transportation of iron sand safe. Since the resumption of production, no deaths or car accidents have occurred in the tunnels and on the ore transport roads.
　　In terms of employee welfare, the Yantongshan Iron Mine has also made many achievements. Employee dormitories of 8,000 square meters have been completed one after another. The clean white walls and ample light in the rooms are in stark contrast to the earthen caves that the workers were forced to dig during the Japanese rule. In terms of medical care, Yantongshan has a dedicated clinic. Over the past few months, workers who have been injured on duty have received timely treatment; in August, all workers rested for two full days due to vaccination. This is again in stark contrast to the Japanese rule, when workers suffered from overwork, lack of clothing, food, and medicine, resulting in dozens of deaths occurring every day.
　　The Yantongshan Iron Mine is advancing by leaps and bounds. By the end of this year, another 500 new workers will be recruited. The amount of iron sand mined will increase from the current 470 tons per day to about 1,000 tons. For this purpose, some workers are specifically engaged in cleaning an old tunnel that can still be mined in the "Eastern" mining area, and the collapsed "Western" inclined shaft. The "Southern Mountain" inclined shaft, which began to be cleaned in May, already produces 50 tons of iron sand per day in July. The cleaning work of the "Southern Neighbor" inclined shaft has been completed, and the scaffolding work is in progress. Once the ore transport iron bridge is erected, the mining of 50 tons of iron sand per day will also be resumed.

　　访烟筒山铁矿场
    本报平绥线记者  李翼
    烟筒山铁矿场在宣化城北五公里处，处于一南北不及数千公尺的峡谷中，采掘场共分“西部”、“东部”、“南邻”、“南山”等四处。储藏铁矿总数为一千六百余万吨，含铁量在百分之四十五左右。日寇侵据末期，因为建立了庞家堡矿场（该地矿砂含铁在百分之六十二，远优于烟筒山），就把这个矿场废弃了。各项机械设备大部失散。去年十二月宣化重获解放后，华北人民政府鉴于北平石景山钢铁厂迫切需要砂铁，烟筒山交通又较为便利，遂决定首先继续施以小规模之开采。四月份正式开工以来，由于全体职工之努力，矿山旧有各坑已大部恢复，机械设备正着手配制。职工已由重获解放时的一百四十四人，增至一千六百余人。四月至八月总采掘量达二万八千五百吨。
    山依旧是烟筒山，矿坑依旧是日本人遗弃的矿坑，但在解放八个月来，经全体职工艰苦努力，恢复建设，烟筒山确实改变了模样。国民党匪帮统治时期，使用职工一百四十四人，专门选择昔日日寇遗留下来的旧铁砂，每日人工采掘新矿不过十五吨。去年十二月人民政府接管后，即着手搜集、配制被毁之器械，积极恢复机械采掘。电气工人首先架设了宣化至烟筒山的专用高压输电线九千余米，和全部坑道、运矿路、选矿场的照明灯。机械工匠从废铁堆里找出牙轮、轴瓦、拉杆等配件，修复了被遗弃在仓库里的三十和一百匹马力的两部压风机。目前正在修配的尚有三十、五十、一百五十三部绞车，和两部三百马力的压风机。道轨工人自四月份以来，已先后展修了约三千公尺的十五公斤运矿小道轨。机厂翻砂工匠，为矿山翻铸了近千的矿车轮，配制了二百二十部新矿车。这样就使着矿砂的采掘，从纯粹人工，逐渐走向了半机械。在工会和行政的积极教育下，新老工人间已逐渐消除了隔阂，一千四百余新工人由于老工人的带领，迅速地学会了技术，使全矿生产效率普遍提高。据统计，采掘一吨原矿所用工数，已由五月份平均工数二点七，降至八月份平均工数的一点五。一吨原矿所用炸药，已由六月份最高一千四百公分，降至八月份的最高额三百七十四公分。
    八个月来，烟筒山所有大小坑道作业，全部贯彻着一条长期、谨慎、小心的方针。日本帝国主义者为着尽快取得铁砂，所有坑道均不讲掘进，一进坑道，即作毫无支柱的面的采掘。同时，由于坑道正巷作业不讲规矩，坑道大小不一，不讲适当弯度、坡度，致使坑道常因进口处或无支柱处的倒坍，而丧失了前进采掘的可能。为彻底纠正日寇此种恶劣作业，八月份全山普遍进行了艰巨的整理工作，并严格的规定了今后巷道作业宽度不得超过二米五，一面大力掘进正巷，一面在面上作极规矩的开采。一个熟练的技术员对我说：现时在两个坑道之间，正在拾采日寇统治时期因无一定作业规矩而被遗弃的大量铁砂，他说“这是对人民负责，不让宝藏永远的被遗弃”。
    在安全设备上，烟筒山矿场已有不少改进。矿山上的领导同志们，除了经常进行安全教育以外，并作了如下的实际设施：一、凿宽太低的坑道，使由坑内向外运矿时免于撞头的危险；二、于顶板崩裂及采完矿柱之后，普遍顶以木柱，或砌以石块；三、炸矿时实行由内及外，以免危险；四、实行“找掉”（即将放炮后未炸下之矿石，予以人工凿＠，以免在其自然倒裂时不及防备；五，将临大悬崖之重车运矿道改到里道：六、于砂库溜子之上，普遍安设安全铁挡，以免翻车不慎时人车俱遭毁灭的危险；七、于每一运矿铁轨尽愿按设立轨，阻止操纵失灵的矿车。这一切，就使着铁砂的采掘、运输逐渐达到了安全的境地。自恢复生产以来，坑道内及运矿路上尚无一死亡车件发生。
    在职工福利方面，烟筒山铁矿场也作了不少成绩，八千平方公尺之职工宿舍，已次第落成。室内洁白的墙壁和充足的光线，与日寇统治时期威逼工人挖筑之土洞，适成一鲜明对比。在医疗方面，烟筒山专设有一医务所。几个月来，因公致伤的工友，均及时得到了治疗；八月间因注射防疫针，全体工友整整休息了两天。这与日寇统治时期，工人因劳动过重，衣、食、医药无着，日必发生十数起的死亡事件，适又成一更鲜明之对比。
    烟筒山铁矿场在大踏步的前进着。到今年底，将再有五百名新工被招进。铁砂采掘量将由现在每日四百七十吨，增扩至一千吨左右。为着这个目的，一部分工友正专门从事清扫着“东部”矿区内尚可开采的一个旧坑道，和倒坍了的“西部”斜井。五月份开始清理的“南山”斜井，七月份即已日产五十吨铁砂。“南邻”斜井清扫工作已毕，棚架工作正在进行。一俟运矿铁桥架成，亦将恢复每日五十吨铁砂之开采。
